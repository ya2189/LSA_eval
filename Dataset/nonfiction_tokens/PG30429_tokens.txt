preface
this
work
was
originally
written
to
be
delivered
as
a
lecture
but
as
its
pages
continued
to
multiply
it
was
suggested
to
the
author
by
numerous
friends
that
it
ought
to
be
published
in
this
at
last
the
author
concluded
to
do
this
work
therefore
does
not
claim
to
be
an
exhaustive
discussion
of
the
various
departments
of
which
it
treats
but
rather
it
has
been
the
aim
of
the
author
to
present
the
more
interesting
observations
in
each
department
in
as
concise
a
form
as
possible
the
author
has
endeavored
to
give
credit
in
every
instance
where
he
has
taken
advantage
of
the
labors
of
others
this
work
is
not
intended
for
that
class
of
people
who
are
so
absolutely
certain
of
the
truth
of
their
religion
and
of
the
immortality
that
it
teaches
that
they
have
become
unqualified
to
entertain
or
even
perceive
of
any
scientific
objection
for
such
people
may
be
likened
unto
those
who
they
see
but
will
not
perceive
and
hearing
they
hear
but
will
not
this
work
is
written
for
the
man
of
culture
who
is
seeking
for
truth
believing
as
does
the
author
that
all
truth
is
god
truth
and
therefore
it
becomes
the
duty
of
every
scientific
man
to
accept
it
knowing
however
that
it
will
surely
modify
the
popular
creeds
and
methods
of
interpretation
its
final
result
can
only
be
to
the
glory
of
god
and
to
the
establishment
of
a
more
exalted
and
purer
religion
all
facts
are
truths
it
consequently
follows
that
all
scientific
facts
are
truths
there
is
no
house
a
statement
is
either
a
truth
or
it
is
not
a
truth
according
to
the
of
if
therefore
we
find
tabulated
amongst
scientific
facts
or
truths
a
statement
which
is
not
a
fact
it
is
not
science
but
all
statements
which
are
facts
it
naturally
follows
are
truths
and
as
such
must
be
accepted
no
matter
how
repulsive
they
may
at
first
seem
to
some
of
our
poetical
imaginings
and
pet
theories
we
can
not
help
but
sympathize
with
the
feelings
which
prompted
president
barnard
to
write
the
following
lines
still
we
will
see
he
was
too
hasty
much
as
i
love
truth
in
the
abstract
he
says
i
love
my
hope
of
immortality
more
he
maintained
that
it
is
better
to
close
one
eyes
to
the
evidences
than
to
be
convinced
of
the
of
certain
doctrines
which
as
subversive
of
the
fundamentals
of
christian
faith
if
this
is
all
is
the
best
that
science
can
give
me
then
i
pray
no
more
science
let
me
live
on
in
my
simple
ignorance
as
my
fathers
lived
before
me
and
when
i
shall
at
length
be
summoned
to
my
final
repose
let
me
still
be
able
to
fold
the
drapery
of
my
couch
about
me
and
lie
down
to
pleasant
even
though
they
be
deceitful
dreams
the
limitations
to
the
acceptance
of
truth
that
president
barnard
makes
is
wrong
for
as
professor
winchell
has
said
we
think
it
is
a
higher
aspiration
to
wish
to
know
truth
and
the
whole
truth
at
the
same
time
we
have
not
the
slightest
apprehension
that
the
whole
truth
can
ever
dissipate
our
faith
in
a
future
life
let
us
prove
all
things
and
hold
fast
unto
that
which
is
good

what
science
can
answer
the
object
of
science
is
not
to
find
out
what
we
like
or
what
we
dislike
the
object
of
science
is
truth
in
the
discussion
of
the
subject
man
created
our
object
will
be
not
to
study
the
many
ways
god
might
have
created
him
but
the
way
he
actually
did
create
him
for
all
ways
would
be
alike
easy
to
an
omnipotent
being
let
us
look
at
man
and
ask
the
question
what
is
there
about
him
which
would
need
an
independent
act
of
creation
any
more
than
about
the
mountain
of
granite
or
the
atom
of
sand
the
answer
comes
back
besides
life
man
has
many
mental
attributes
let
us
direct
our
attention
at
first
to
the
grand
phenomena
of
life
and
then
to
attributes
to
discover
the
nature
of
life
to
find
out
what
life
really
is
it
would
be
folly
to
commence
by
comparing
man
the
perfection
of
living
beings
with
an
inorganic
or
inanimate
substance
like
a
brick
to
discover
the
hidden
secret
for
as
professor
orton
says
that
only
is
essential
to
life
which
is
common
to
all
forms
of
life
our
brains
stomach
livers
hands
and
feet
are
luxuries
they
are
necessary
to
make
us
human
but
not
living
beings
instead
of
man
then
it
will
be
necessary
for
us
to
take
the
simplest
being
which
possesses
such
a
phenomena
and
such
are
the
little
homogeneous
specks
of
protoplasm
constituting
the
group
which
are
entirely
destitute
of
structure
and
to
which
the
name
cytode
has
been
given
in
the
fresh
waters
in
the
neighborhood
of
jena
minute
lumps
of
protoplasm
were
discovered
by
haeckel
which
on
being
examined
under
the
most
powerful
lens
of
a
microscope
were
seen
to
have
no
constant
form
their
outlines
being
in
a
state
of
perpetual
change
caused
by
the
protrusion
from
various
parts
of
their
surface
of
broad
lobes
and
thick
projections
which
after
remaining
visible
for
a
time
would
be
withdrawn
to
make
their
appearance
again
on
some
other
part
of
the
surface
to
this
little
mass
of
protoplasm
haeckel
has
given
the
name
these
little
lumps
multiply
by
spontaneous
division
into
two
pieces
which
on
becoming
dependent
increase
in
size
and
acquire
all
the
characteristics
of
the
parent
from
this
illustration
it
will
be
seen
that
reproduction
is
a
form
of
nutrition
and
a
growth
of
the
individual
to
a
size
beyond
that
belonging
to
it
as
an
individual
so
that
a
part
is
thus
elevated
into
a
new
whole
it
is
to
this
simple
state
of
the
monera
the
egg
of
any
animal
is
transformed
the
germ
vesicle
the
original
egg
kernel
disappears
and
the
parent
kernel
cytococcus
forms
itself
anew
and
it
is
in
this
condition
a
ball
of
protoplasm
a
true
cytod
a
homogeneous
structureless
body
without
different
constituent
parts
that
the
human
child
as
well
as
all
other
living
beings
take
their
first
steps
in
development
no
matter
how
wonderful
this
may
seem
the
fact
stares
us
in
the
face
that
the
entire
human
child
as
well
as
every
animal
with
all
their
great
future
possibilities
are
in
their
first
stage
a
small
ball
of
this
complex
homogeneous
substance
whether
we
consider
a
mere
infinitesimal
ovoid
particle
which
finds
space
and
duration
enough
to
multiply
into
countless
millions
in
the
body
of
a
living
fly
and
then
of
the
wealth
of
foliage
the
luxuriance
of
flower
and
fruit
which
lies
between
this
bald
sketch
of
a
plant
and
the
gigantic
pine
of
california
towering
to
the
dimensions
of
a
cathedral
spire
or
the
indian
fig
which
covers
acres
with
its
profound
shadow
and
endures
while
nations
and
empires
come
and
go
around
its
vast
circumference
or
we
look
at
the
other
half
of
the
world
of
life
picturing
to
ourselves
the
great
finner
whale
hugest
of
beasts
that
live
or
have
lived
disporting
his
eighty
or
ninety
feet
of
bone
muscle
and
blubber
with
easy
roll
among
the
waves
in
which
the
stoutest
ship
that
ever
left
would
founder
hopelessly
and
contrast
him
with
the
invisible
animalcule
mere
gelatinous
specks
multitudes
of
which
could
in
fact
dance
upon
the
point
of
a
needle
with
the
same
ease
as
the
angels
of
the
schoolman
could
in
imagination
with
these
images
before
our
minds
it
would
be
strange
if
we
did
not
ask
what
community
of
form
or
structure
is
there
between
the
fungus
and
the
the
animalcule
and
the
whale
and
between
all
four
notwithstanding
these
apparent
difficulties
a
threefold
unity
namely
a
unity
of
power
or
faculty
a
unity
of
form
and
a
unity
of
substantial
composition
does
pervade
the
whole
living
world
and
this
unit
is
protoplasm
so
we
see
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
retreat
to
our
protoplasm
as
a
naked
formless
plasma
if
we
would
find
freed
from
all
complications
the
agent
to
which
has
been
assigned
the
duty
of
building
up
structure
and
of
transforming
the
energy
of
lifeless
matter
into
the
living
even
goethe
in
almost
stated
this
when
he
said
plants
and
animals
regarded
in
their
most
imperfect
condition
are
hardly
distinguishable
this
much
however
we
may
say
that
from
a
condition
in
which
plant
is
hardly
to
be
distinguished
from
animal
creatures
have
appeared
gradually
perfecting
themselves
in
two
opposite
directions
the
plant
is
finally
glorified
into
the
tree
enduring
and
motionless
the
animal
into
the
human
being
of
the
highest
mobility
and
freedom
let
us
examine
for
a
moment
this
substance
protoplasm
and
see
in
what
way
it
differs
from
inorganic
matter
or
in
what
way
the
animate
differs
from
the
inanimate
the
living
from
the
dead
felix
dujardin
a
french
zoologist
pointed
out
that
the
only
living
substance
in
the
body
of
rhizopods
and
other
inferior
primitive
animals
is
identical
with
protoplasm
he
called
it
hugo
von
mohl
first
applied
the
name
protoplasm
to
the
peculiar
serus
and
mobile
substance
in
the
interior
of
vegetable
cells
and
he
perceived
its
high
importance
but
was
very
far
from
understanding
its
significance
in
relation
to
all
organisms
not
however
until
ferdinand
cohn
and
more
fully
franz
unger
had
established
the
identity
of
the
animate
and
contractile
protoplasm
in
vegetable
cells
and
the
sarcode
of
the
lower
animals
could
max
shultz
in
elaborate
the
protoplasm
theory
of
the
sarcode
so
as
to
proclaim
protoplasm
to
be
the
most
essential
and
important
constituent
of
all
organic
cells
and
to
show
that
the
bag
or
husk
of
the
cell
the
cellular
membrane
and
intercellular
substance
are
but
secondary
parts
of
the
cell
and
are
frequently
wanting
in
a
similar
manner
lionel
beale
gave
to
protoplasm
including
the
cellular
germ
the
name
of
germinal
matter
and
to
all
the
other
substance
entering
into
the
composition
of
tissue
being
secondary
and
produced
the
name
of
formed
matter
wherever
there
is
life
there
is
protoplasm
wherever
there
is
protoplasm
there
too
is
life
the
physical
consistence
of
protoplasm
varies
with
the
amount
of
water
with
which
it
is
combined
from
the
solid
form
in
which
we
find
it
in
the
dormant
state
to
the
thin
watery
state
in
which
it
occurs
in
the
leaves
of
valisneria
as
to
its
composition
chemistry
can
as
yet
give
but
scanty
information
it
can
tell
that
it
is
composed
of
carbon
hydrogen
oxygen
nitrogen
sulphur
and
phosphorus
and
it
can
also
tell
the
percentage
of
each
element
but
it
can
not
give
more
than
a
formula
that
will
express
it
as
a
whole
giving
no
information
as
to
the
nature
of
the
numerous
albuminoid
substances
which
compose
it
edward
cope
in
his
article
on
comparative
anatomy
gives
the
formula
for
protoplasm
as
a
whole
c
h
n
o
s
and
p
in
small
quantities
under
some
circumstances
it
is
therefore
he
says
a
nitryl
of
cellulose
c
h
o
according
to
mulder
the
composition
of
albumen
one
of
the
class
of
protein
substances
to
which
protoplasm
belongs
is
c
h
n
o
s
protoplasm
is
identical
in
both
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdom
it
behaves
the
same
from
whatever
source
it
may
be
derived
towards
several
as
also
electricity
is
it
possible
then
that
the
protoplasm
which
produces
the
mould
is
exactly
the
same
composition
as
that
which
produces
the
human
child
the
answer
is
yes
so
far
as
the
elements
are
concerned
but
the
proportions
of
carbon
hydrogen
must
enter
into
an
infinite
number
of
diverse
stratifications
and
combination
in
the
production
of
the
various
forms
of
life
professor
frankland
speaking
of
protein
for
instance
says
it
is
capable
of
existing
under
probably
at
least
a
thousand
isomeric
forms
protoplasm
may
be
distinguished
under
the
microscope
from
other
members
of
the
class
to
which
it
belongs
on
account
of
the
faculty
it
possesses
of
combining
with
certain
coloring
matters
as
carmine
and
aniline
it
is
colored
or
by
iodine
and
nitric
acid
and
it
is
coagulated
by
alcohol
and
mineral
acids
as
well
as
by
heat
it
possesses
the
quality
of
absorbing
water
in
various
quantities
which
renders
it
sometimes
extremely
soft
and
nearly
liquid
and
sometimes
hard
and
firm
like
leather
its
prominent
physical
properties
are
excitability
and
contractility
which
kühne
and
others
have
especially
investigated
the
motion
of
protoplasm
in
plants
was
first
made
known
by
bonaventure
corti
a
century
ago
in
the
charoe
plants
but
this
important
fact
was
forgotten
and
it
had
to
be
discovered
by
treviranus
in
the
regular
motion
of
the
protoplasm
forming
a
perfect
current
may
be
seen
in
the
hairs
of
the
nettle
and
weighty
evidence
exists
that
similar
currents
occur
in
all
young
vegetable
cells
if
such
be
the
case
says
huxley
the
wonderful
noonday
silence
of
a
tropical
forest
is
after
all
due
only
to
the
dullness
of
our
hearing
and
could
our
ears
catch
the
murmur
of
these
tiny
maelstroms
as
they
whirl
in
innumerable
myriads
of
living
cells
which
constitute
each
tree
we
should
be
stunned
as
with
a
roar
of
a
great
city
one
step
higher
in
the
scale
of
life
than
the
monera
is
the
vegetable
or
animal
cell
which
arose
out
of
the
monera
by
the
important
process
of
segregation
in
their
homogeneous
viscid
bodies
the
differentiation
of
an
inner
kernel
from
the
surrounding
plasma
by
this
means
the
great
progress
from
a
simple
cytod
without
kernel
into
a
real
cell
with
kernel
was
accomplished
some
of
these
cells
at
an
early
stage
encased
themselves
by
secreting
a
hardened
membrane
they
formed
the
first
vegetable
cells
while
others
remaining
naked
developed
into
the
first
aggregate
of
animal
cells
the
vegetable
cell
has
usually
two
concentric
coverings
and
primordial
utricle
in
animal
cells
the
former
is
wanting
the
membrane
representing
the
utricle
as
a
general
fact
also
animal
cells
are
smaller
than
vegetable
cells
their
size
varies
greatly
but
are
generally
invisible
to
the
naked
eye
ranging
from
to
of
an
inch
in
diameter
about
four
thousand
of
the
smallest
would
be
required
to
cover
the
dot
put
over
the
letter
i
in
writing
the
shape
of
cells
varies
greatly
the
normal
form
though
is
spheroidal
as
in
the
cells
of
fat
but
they
often
become
sometimes
flattened
as
in
the
cuticle
and
sometimes
elongated
into
a
simple
filament
as
in
fibrous
tissue
or
muscular
fibre
the
cell
therefore
is
extremely
interesting
since
all
animal
and
vegetable
structure
is
but
the
multiplication
of
the
cell
as
a
unit
and
the
whole
life
of
the
plant
or
animal
is
that
of
the
cells
which
compose
them
and
in
them
or
by
them
all
its
vital
processes
are
carried
on
it
may
sound
paradoxical
to
speak
of
an
animal
or
plant
being
composed
of
millions
of
cells
but
beyond
the
momentary
shock
of
the
paradox
no
harm
is
done
the
cell
then
can
be
regarded
as
the
basis
of
our
physiological
idea
of
the
elementary
organism
but
in
the
animal
as
well
as
in
the
plant
neither
nor
nucleus
is
an
essential
constituent
of
the
cell
inasmuch
as
bodies
which
are
unquestionably
the
equivalents
of
cells
true
morphological
units
may
be
mere
masses
of
protoplasm
devoid
alike
of
or
nucleus
for
the
whole
living
world
then
the
primary
and
a
mental
form
of
life
is
merely
an
individual
mass
of
protoplasm
in
which
no
further
structure
is
discernible
well
then
has
protoplasm
been
called
the
universal
concomitant
of
every
phenomena
of
life
life
is
inseparable
from
this
substance
but
is
dormant
unless
excited
by
some
external
stimulant
such
as
heat
light
electricity
food
water
and
oxygen
although
we
have
seen
that
the
life
of
the
plant
as
well
as
of
the
animal
is
protoplasm
and
that
the
protoplasm
of
the
plant
and
that
of
the
animal
bear
the
closest
resemblance
yet
plants
can
manufacture
protoplasm
out
of
mineral
compounds
whereas
animals
are
obliged
to
procure
it
ready
made
and
hence
in
the
end
depend
on
plants
without
plants
says
professor
orton
animals
would
perish
without
animals
plants
had
no
need
to
be
the
food
of
a
plant
is
a
matter
whose
energy
is
all
expended
is
a
fallen
weight
but
the
plant
organism
receives
it
exposes
it
to
the
sun
rays
and
in
a
way
mysterious
to
us
converts
the
actual
energy
of
the
sunlight
into
potential
energy
within
it
it
is
for
this
reason
that
life
has
been
termed
the
principal
food
of
the
plant
consists
of
carbon
united
with
oxygen
to
form
carbonic
acid
hydrogen
united
with
oxygen
to
form
water
and
nitrogen
united
with
hydrogen
to
form
ammonia
these
elements
thus
united
which
in
themselves
are
perfectly
lifeless
the
plant
is
able
to
convert
into
living
protoplasm
plants
are
says
huxley
the
accumulators
of
the
power
which
animals
distribute
and
disperse
boussengault
found
long
since
that
peas
sown
in
pure
sand
moistened
with
distilled
water
and
fed
by
the
air
obtained
all
the
carbon
necessary
for
their
development
flowering
and
fructification
here
we
see
a
plant
which
not
only
maintains
its
vigor
on
these
few
substances
but
grows
until
it
has
increased
a
millionfold
or
a
the
quantity
of
protoplasm
it
originally
possessed
and
this
protoplasm
exhibits
the
phenomena
of
life
this
and
other
proof
led
dumas
to
say
from
the
loftiest
point
of
view
and
in
connection
with
the
physics
of
the
globe
it
would
be
imperative
on
us
to
say
that
in
so
far
as
their
truly
organic
elements
are
concerned
plants
and
animals
are
the
offspring
of
the
air
schleiden
speaking
of
the
haymakers
of
switzerland
and
the
tyrol
says
he
mows
his
definite
amount
of
grass
every
year
on
the
alps
inaccessible
to
cattle
and
gives
not
back
the
smallest
quantity
of
organic
substance
to
the
soil
whence
comes
the
hay
if
not
from
the
atmosphere
it
has
been
seen
then
that
plants
can
manufacture
protoplasm
a
faculty
which
animals
are
not
possessed
of
they
at
best
can
only
convert
dead
protoplasm
into
living
protoplasm
thus
when
vegetable
or
meat
is
cooked
their
protoplasm
dies
but
is
not
rendered
incompetent
of
resuming
its
old
functions
as
a
matter
of
life
if
i
says
huxley
should
eat
a
piece
of
cooked
mutton
which
was
once
the
living
protoplasm
of
a
sheep
the
protoplasm
rendered
dead
by
cooking
will
be
changed
into
living
protoplasm
and
thus
i
would
transubstantiate
sheep
into
man
and
were
i
to
return
to
my
own
place
by
sea
and
undergo
shipwreck
the
crustacean
might
and
probably
would
return
the
compliment
and
demonstrate
our
common
nature
by
turning
my
protoplasm
into
living
lobster
as
has
been
said
before
where
there
are
life
manifestations
there
is
protoplasm
life
is
regarded
by
one
class
of
thinkers
as
the
principle
or
cause
of
organization
and
according
to
the
other
life
is
the
product
or
effect
of
organization
we
must
however
agree
with
professor
orton
who
says
life
is
the
effect
of
organization
not
the
result
of
it
animals
do
not
live
because
they
are
organized
but
are
organized
because
they
are
alive
in
whatever
way
it
is
looked
at
life
is
but
a
forced
condition
the
more
advanced
thinkers
then
in
science
says
barker
therefore
look
upon
the
life
of
the
living
form
as
inseparable
from
its
substance
and
believe
that
the
former
is
purely
phenomenal
and
only
a
manifestation
of
the
latter
during
the
existence
of
a
special
force
as
such
they
retain
the
term
only
to
express
the
sum
of
the
phenomena
of
living
beings
the
word
life
must
be
regarded
then
as
only
a
generalized
expression
signifying
the
of
the
properties
of
matter
possessing
such
organization
in
what
manner
then
does
this
matter
possessing
the
phenomena
of
life
differ
from
inorganic
matter
or
in
what
manner
does
living
matter
differ
from
matter
not
living
the
forces
which
are
at
work
on
the
one
side
are
at
work
on
the
other
the
phenomena
of
life
are
all
dependent
upon
the
working
of
the
same
physical
and
chemical
forces
as
those
which
are
active
in
the
rest
of
the
world
it
may
be
convenient
to
use
the
terms
vitality
and
vital
force
to
denote
the
cause
of
certain
groups
of
natural
operations
as
we
employ
the
names
of
electricity
and
electrical
force
to
denote
others
but
it
ceases
to
do
so
if
such
a
name
implies
the
absurd
assumption
that
either
electricity
or
vitality
is
an
entity
playing
the
part
of
a
sufficient
cause
of
electrical
or
vital
phenomena
a
mass
of
living
protoplasm
is
simply
a
machine
of
great
complexity
the
total
result
of
the
work
of
which
or
its
vital
phenomena
depend
on
the
one
hand
upon
its
construction
and
on
the
other
upon
the
energy
supplied
to
it
and
to
speak
of
vitality
as
anything
but
the
names
of
a
series
of
operations
is
as
if
one
should
talk
of
the
horologity
of
a
clock
when
hydrogen
and
oxygen
are
united
by
an
electrical
spark

is
produced
certainly
there
is
no

between
the

produced
and

such

are
called
the
properties
of
water
it
is
not
assumed
that
a
certain
something
called
acquosity
has
entered
into
and
taken
possession
of
the
oxide
of
hydrogen
as
soon
as
formed
and
then
guarded
the
particles
in
the
facets
of
the
crystal
or
amongst
the
leaflets
of
the
on
the
contrary
it
is
hoped
molecular
physics
will
in
time
explain
the
phenomena
what
better
philosophical
status
says
huxley
has
vitality
than
acquosity
if
the
properties
of
water
may
be
properly
said
to
result
from
the
nature
and
disposition
of
its
molecules
i
can
find
no
intelligible
ground
for
refusing
to
say
that
the
properties
of
protoplasm
result
from
the
nature
and
disposition
of
its
molecules
to
distinguish
the
living
from
the

whenever

we
must
presume
that
either
during
this
long
lapse
of
centuries
the
principle
of
the
plant
has
been
imprisoned
in
the
most
dreary
and
impenetrable

dungeons
whither
no

effluence
from
the
general
of
could
affect
it
or
else
that
the
germ
of
the
future

is
there
only
in
the

an

in
which
death

but
in
which
matter
merely
changes
its
place
and

let
us
now
compare
the
inorganic
world
with
the
organic
the
inanimate
with
the
animate
and
see
if
there
does
exist
an
inseparable
boundary
between
them
the
fundamental
properties
of
every
natural
body
are
matter
form
and
force
one
important
point
to
be
noticed
is
that
the
elements
which
compose
all
animate
bodies
are
the
very
elements
that
help
to
build
up
the
inanimate
bodies
no
new
elements
appear
in
the
vegetable
or
animal
world
which
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
inorganic
world
the
difference
between
animate
and
inanimate
bodies
therefore
is
certainly
not
in
the
elements
which
form
them
but
in
the
molecular
combination
of
them
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
molecular
physics
will
at
some
not
far
distant
time
enlighten
us
as
to
the
peculiar
state
of
aggregation
in
which
the
molecules
exist
in
living
matter
as
to
the
form
it
is
impossible
to
find
any
essential
difference
in
the
external
form
and
inner
structure
between
inorganic
and
organic
bodies
for
the
simple
monad
which
is
as
much
a
living
organism
as
the
most
complex
being
is
nothing
but
a
homogeneous
structureless
mass
of
protoplasm
but
just
as
the
inorganic
substance
according
to
laws
elaborates
its
structure
into
a
crystal
of
great
beauty
so
does
the
protoplasm
elaborate
itself
into
the
most
beautiful
of
all
structures
the
cell
unit
just
as
gold
and
copper
crystallizes
in
a
geometrical
form
a
cube
bismuth
and
antimony
in
a
hexagonal
iodine
and
sulphur
in
a
rhombic
form
so
we
find
among
radiolaria
and
among
other
protista
and
lower
forms
that
they
may
be
traced
to
a
mathematical
fundamental
form
and
whose
form
in
its
whole
as
well
as
in
its
parts
is
bounded
by
definite
geometrically
determinable
planes
and
angles
now
as
to
the
forces
of
the
two
different
groups
of
bodies
surely
the
constructive
force
of
a
crystal
is
due
to
the
chemical
composition
and
to
its
material
constitution
as
the
shape
of
the
crystal
and
its
size
are
influenced
by
surrounding
circumstances
there
is
therefore
an
external
constructive
force
at
work
the
only
difference
between
the
growth
of
an
organism
and
that
of
a
crystal
is
that
in
the
former
case
in
consequence
of
its
state
of
aggregation
the
newly
added
particles
penetrate
into
the
interior
of
the
organism
whereas
inorganic
substances
receive
homogeneous
matter
from
without
only
by
opposition
or
an
addition
of
new
particles
to
the
surface
if
we
then
designate
the
growth
and
the
formation
of
organisms
as
a
process
of
life
we
may
with
equal
reason
apply
the
same
term
with
the
developing
crystal
it
is
for
these
and
other
reasons
demonstrating
as
they
do
the
unity
of
organic
and
inorganic
nature
the
essential
agreement
of
inorganic
and
organic
bodies
in
matter
form
and
force
which
led
tyndall
to
say
abandoning
all
disguise
the
confession
that
i
feel
bound
to
make
before
you
is
that
i
prolong
the
vision
backward
across
the
boundary
of
experimental
evidence
and
discern
in
that
matter
which
we
in
our
ignorance
and
notwithstanding
our
professed
reverence
for
its
creator
have
hitherto
covered
with
opprobrium
the
promise
and
potency
of
every
form
and
quality
of
life
returning
now
to
our
protoplasm
let
us
ask
the
question
where
did
it
come
from
or
how
did
it
come
into
existence
though
chemical
synthesis
has
built
up
a
number
of
organic
substances
which
have
been
deemed
the
product
of
vitality
yet
up
to
the
present
day
the
fact
stands
out
before
us
that
no
one
has
ever
built
up
one
particle
of
living
matter
however
minute
from
lifeless
elements
the
protoplasm
of
is
simply
a
continuation
of
the
protoplasm
of
other
ages
handed
down
to
us
through
periods
of
undefinable
and
indeterminable
time
the
question
of
where
protoplasm
came
from
how
it
arose
chemistry
is
unable
to
answer
but
the
question
is
answered
probably
by
spontaneous
generation
only
the
merest
particle
of
living
protoplasm
was
necessary
to
be
formed
from
lifeless
matter
in
the
beginning
for
in
the
eyes
of
any
consistent
evolutionist
any
further
independent
formation
would
be
sheer
waste
as
the
hypothesis
of
evolution
postulates
the
unlimited
though
perhaps
not
indefinite
modifiability
of
such
matter
as
we
have
seen
that
there
exists
no
absolute
barrier
between
organic
and
inorganic
bodies
it
is
not
so
difficult
to
conceive
that
the
first
particle
of
protoplasm
may
have
originated
under
suitable
conditions
out
of
inorganic
or
lifeless
matter
but
the
causes
which
have
led
to
the
origination
of
this
particle
it
may
be
said
we
know
absolutely
nothing
as
in
the
formation
of
the
crystal
and
the
cell
the
ultimate
causes
remain
in
both
cases
concealed
from
us
at
the
time
in
the
earth
history
when
water
in
a
liquid
state
made
its
appearance
on
the
cooled
crust
of
the
earth
the
carbon
probably
existed
as
carbonic
acid
dispersed
in
the
atmosphere
and
from
the
very
best
of
grounds
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
density
and
electric
condition
of
the
atmosphere
were
quite
different
as
also
the
chemical
and
physical
nature
of
the
primeval
ocean
was
quite
different
in
any
case
therefore
even
if
we
do
not
know
anything
more
about
it
there
remains
the
supposition
which
can
at
least
not
be
disputed
that
at
that
time
under
conditions
quite
different
from
those
of
a
spontaneous
generation
which
is
now
perhaps
no
longer
possible
may
have
taken
place
this
point
is
now
conceded
by
most
all
of
the
advanced
scientists
of
the
day
and
is
absolutely
necessary
for
the
completion
of
the
hypothesis
of
evolution
the
answer
may
come
to
this
well
suppose
the
first
protoplasm
did
originate
by
spontaneous
generation
where
did
the
elements
or
force
come
from
which
compose
it
science
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
coming
into
existence
of
matter
or
force
for
she
proves
both
to
be
indestructible
when
they
disappear
they
do
so
only
to
reappear
in
some
other
form
the
coming
into
existence
of
matter
and
force
as
also
the
ultimate
cause
of
all
phenomena
is
beyond
the
domain
of
scientific
inquiry
science
has
only
to
do
with
the
coming
in
of
the
form
of
matter
not
the
coming
in
of
its
existence

it
is
necessary
now
to
take
up
the
little

of

admitting
its
coming

by
spontaneous

as
probable
and
so
probable
that
it
almost
amounts
to

changes
it
is
about
to
make
under

of
the
laws
which
govern

it
has
culminated
in

these
laws
still
acting
on

of

perfecting
it
and
leading
him
on
to
the
comprehension
of
a
grander
and
nobler
conception
of
the
almighty
and
of
his
works
the
start
then
must
be
made
with
a
homogeneous
mass
of
protoplasm
such
as
the
existing
of
the
present
day
which
is
a
structureless
organism
without
organs
and
which
came
into
existence
during
the
laurentian
period
it
is
to
this
simplified
condition
as
i
have
previously
stated
all
fertilized
eggs
return
before
they
commence
to
develop
the
first
process
of
adaptation
effected
by
the
monera
must
have
been
the
condensation
of
an
external
crust
which
as
a
protecting
covering
shut
in
the
softer
interior
from
the
hostile
influences
of
the
outer
world
as
soon
as
by
condensation
of
the
homogeneous
moneron
a
arose
in
the
interior
and
a
membrane
arose
on
the
surface
all
the
fundamental
parts
of
the
unit
were
then
furnished
such
a
unit
was
an
organism
similar
to
the
white
corpuscle
of
the
blood
and
called
here
we
have
two
different
stages
of
evolution
the
protoplasma

plasson
of
the
cytod
undergoes
differentiation
and
is
split
up
into
two
kinds
of
albuminous
substances
the
inner
nucleus
and
the
outer
protoplasma
edward
von
benden
in
his
work
upon
first
clearly
pointed
out
this
fact
that
we
must
distinguish
thoroughly
between
the
plasson
of
cytods
and
the
protoplasm
of
cells
an
irrefutable
proof
that
such
primæval
animals
like
the
amoeba
really
existed
as
the
direct
ancestors
of
man
is
furnished
according
to
the
fundamental
law
of
biogeny
by
the
fact
that
the
human
egg
is
nothing
more
than
a
simple
cell
the
next
step
taken
in
advance
is
the
division
of
the
cell
in
two
there
arise
from
the
single
germinal
spot
two
new
kernel
specks
and
then
in
like
manner
out
of
the
germinal
vesicle
two
new
the
same
process
of
now
repeats
itself
several
times
in
succession
and
the
products
of
the
division
form
a
perfect
union
this
organism
may
be
called
a
community
of
synamoebæ

the
community
of
amoeba

the

thus
first
produced
here
we
find
from
the
synamoebæ
which
crept
about
slowly
at
the
bottom
of
the
laurentian
primeval
ocean
by
means
of
movements
like
those
of
an
amoeba
that
the
planæa
by
the
vibrating
movements
of
the
cilia
the
entire
multicellular
body
acquired
a
more
rapid
and
stronger
motion
and
passed
over
from
the
creeping
to
the

the

then
of

the

with

which
resembles
the

differs
essentially
in
the
fact
that

this
exceedingly
important
larval
form
the
gastrula
makes
its

in

of

of
animals
these
gastræada
must
have
existed
during
the
older
primordial
period
and
they
must
have
also
included
the
ancestors
of
man
a
certain
proof
of
this
is
furnished
by
the
amphioxus
which
in
spite
of
its
blood
relationship
to
man
still
passes
through
the
stage
of
the
gastrula
with
a
simple
intestine
and
a
double

by
motion
of
the

the
gastræa
swam
freely
about
in
the

the
development
of
the
gastræa
now
deviated
in
two
directions
one
branch
of
gastræads
gave
up
free
locomotion
adhered
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
thus
by
adopting
an
adhesive
mode
of
life
gave
rise
to
the
proascus
the
common
primary
form
of
the
animal
plants
zoophyta
the
other
branch
was
originated
by
the
formation
of
a
middle
or
muscular
layer
and
also
by
the
further
differentiation
of
the
internal
parts
into
various
organs
more
especially
the
first
formation
of
a
nervous
system
the
simplest
organs
of
sense
the
simplest
organs
for
secretion
kidneys
and
generation
sexual
organs
this
branch
is
the
prothelmis
the
common
primary
worms
vermes
like
the
turbellaria
of
the
present
day
the
whole
surface
of
their
body
was
covered
with
cilia
and
they
possessed
a
simple
body
of
an
oval
shape
entirely
without
appendages
these
acoelomatous
worms
did
not
as
yet
possess
a
true
body
cavity
coelom
nor
blood
no
member
of
the
next
higher
animals
are
in
existence
neither
are
there
any
fossil
remains
owing
to
the
soft
nature
of
their
body
they
are
therefore
called
soft
worms
or
scoleceda
they
developed
out
of
the
turbellaria
of
the
sixth
stage
by
forming
a
true
body
cavity
a
coelom
and
blood
in
their
interior
the
nearest
still
living
coelomati
is
probably
the
acorn
worms
balanoglossus
the
form
value
of
this
stage
must
moreover
have
been
represented
by
several
different
intermediate
stages
out
of
the
four
different
groups
of
the
worm
tribe
the
four
higher
tribes
of
the
animal
kingdom
were
developed
the
echinoderma
and
insects
arthropoda
on
the
one
hand
and
the
molluscs
mollusca
and
vertebrated
animals

on
the
other
out
of
certain
coelomati
the
most
ancient
vertebrata
were
directly
developed
among
the
coelomati
of
the
present
day
the
ascidians
are
the
nearest
relatives
of
this
exceedingly
remarkable
worm
which
connect
the
widely
differing
classes
of
invertebrate
and
vertebrate
animals
to
these
animals
have
been
given
the
name
of

originated
out
of
the
worms

seventh

the
formation
of

by
the

agrees
with

itself
to

only
in

the
primary
forms
of
genuine
apes
and
consequently
of
man
they
developed
out
of
handed
or
marsupials
pedumana
of
appearance
by
the
formation
of
a
placenta
the
loss
of
the
marsupium
and
the
marsupial
bones
and
by
the
higher
development
of
the
commissures
of
the
brain
the
brachytarsi
especially
the
muki
indie
and
lori
possess
possibly
a
faint
resemblance
out
of
the
developed
two
classes
of
genuine
apes
but
as
the
or
catarrhini
class
are
the
only
ones
related
to
man
the
others
will
not
be
considered
these
apes
originated
by
the
transformation
of
the
jaw
and
by
the
claws
on
the
toes
changing
into
nails
the
and
holy
apes
semnopithecus
probably
resembled
the
oldest
ancestors
of
this
group
the
tailed
apes
by
the
loss
of
their
tail
and
some
of
their
hair
covering
and
by
the
excessive
development
of
that
portion
of
their
brain
above
the
facial
portion
of
the
skull
developed
into
the
apes
anthropoides
such
as
the
gorilla
and
chimpanzee
of
africa
and
the
orang
and
gibbon
of
asia
the
human
ancestors
of
this
group
existed
during
the
miocene
period
from
the
anthropoides
developed
the
men
pithecanthropi
during
the
tertiary
period
the
speechless
primæval
men
alali
then
is
the
connecting
link
between
the
apes
and
man
the
of
the
anthropoides
became
the
human
hand
their
a
foot
for
walking
they
did
not
possess
the
articulate
human
language
of
words
and
the
higher
developments
as
consciousness
and
the
formation
of
ideas
must
have
been
very
imperfect
out
of
the
pithecanthropi
men
developed
genuine
man
by
the
development
of
the
animal
language
of
sounds
into
a
connected
or
articulate
language
of
words
the
brain
also
developed
higher
and
higher
this
transition
took
place
probably
at
the
beginning
of
the
quaternary
period
or
possibly
in
the
tertiary
we
have
now
very
briefly
reviewed
the
principal
outlines
of
the
ancestors
of
man
showing
that
man
has
developed
from
the
little
mass
of
protoplasm
as
have
all
animals
and
plants
he
therefore
was
not
created
but
was
developed
the
question
is
often
asked
by
people
with
much
delight
why
do
we
not
behold
the
interesting
spectacle
of
the
transformation
of
a
chimpanzee
into
a
man
or
conversely
of
a
man
by
retrogression
into
an
orang
it
only
shows
that
they
are
not
acquainted
with
the
first
principles
of
the
doctrine
of
descent
not
one
of
the
apes
says
schmidt
can
revert
to
the
state
of
his
primordial
ancestors
except
by
retrogression
by
which
a
primordial
condition
is
by
no
means
attained
he
can
not
divest
himself
of
his
acquired
characters
fixed
by
heredity
nor
can
he
exceed
himself
and
become
man
for
man
does
not
stand
in
the
direct
line
of
development
from
the
ape
the
development
of
the
anthropoid
apes
has
taken
a
lateral
course
from
the
nearest
human
progenitors
and
man
can
as
little
be
transformed
into
a
gorilla
as
a
squirrel
can
be
changed
into
a
rat

feeling
evidently
says
haeckel
rather
than
understanding
induces
most
people
to
combat
the
theory
of
their
from
apes
it
is
simply
because
the
organism
of
the
ape
appears
a
caricature
of
man
a
distorted
likeness
of
ourselves
in
a
not
very
attractive
form
because
the
customary
æsthetic
ideas
and
of
man
are
touched
by
this
in
so
sensitive
a
point
that
most
men
shrink
from
recognizing
their
descent
from
apes
it
seems
much
pleasanter
to
be
descended
from
a
more
highly
developed
divine
being
and
hence
as
is
well
known
human
vanity
has
from
the
earliest
times
flattered
itself
by
assuming
the
original
descent
of
the
race
from
gods
or
evolution
in
the
last
chapter
a
description
was
given
of
the
various
stages
in
man
development
from
the
microscopic
monad
up
it
will
be
necessary
now
to
describe
briefly
the
various
laws
which
have
governed
this
evolutionary
chain
from
the
monad
to
man
but
before
proceeding
directly
to
the
subject
let
us
look
at
the
doctrine
of
evolution
as
a
whole
and
trace
it
first
in
the
formation
of
the
world
the
doctrine
of
evolution
is
also
called
the
theory
of
development
it
must
not
however
be
confused
with
darwinism
for
they
are
not
exactly
synonymous
darwinism
is
an
attempt
to
explain
the
laws
or
manner
of
evolution
strictly
speaking
only
the
theory
of
selection
should
be
called
darwinism
which
was
established
in
the
theory
of
descent
or
transmutation
theory
or
doctrine
of
filiation
should
properly
be
called
lamarckism
who
for
the
first
time
worked
out
the
theory
of
descent
as
an
independent
scientific
theory
of
the
first
order
and
as
the
philosophical
foundation
of
the
whole
science
of
biology
according
to
the
theory
of
development
evolution
in
its
simplest
form
says
henry
hartshorne
the
universe
as
it
now
exists
is
a
result
of
immense
series
of
changes
related
to
and
dependent
upon
each
other
as
successive
steps
or
rather
growths
constituting
a
progress
analogous
to
the
unfolding
or
evolving
of
the
parts
of
a
growing
organism
herbert
spencer
defined
evolution
as
consisting
in
a
progress
from
the
homogeneous
to
the
heterogeneous
from
general
to
special
from
the
simple
to
the
complex
and
this
process
is
considered
to
be
traceable
in
the
formation
of
worlds
in
space
in
the
multiplication
of
the
types
and
species
of
plants
and
animals
on
the
globe
in
the
origination
and
diversity
of
languages
literature
arts
and
sciences
and
in
all
changes
of
human
institutions
and
society

let
us
now
apply
this
theory
of
evolution
to
the
physical
world
no
determined
opposition
by
the
mass
of
people
is
likely
to
be
manifested
to
the
doctrine
of
evolution
as
applied
to
the
physical
world
or
even
to
the
vegetable
or
animal
world
up
to
man
but
the
minute
man
is
included
then
is
a
voice
raised
up
against
it
and
it
was
for
this
reason
that
darwin
in
his
first
work
on
the
theory
of
descent
did
not
mention
man
as
being
included
in
the
evolutionary
series
he
knew
too
well
the
foolish
human
weakness
that
existed
in
a
recent
work
by
challes
he
states
that
he
regards
the
material
universe
as
a
vast
and
wonderful
mechanism
of
which
the
least
wonderful
thing
is
its
being
so
constructed
that
we
can
understand
it
the
following
is
a
brief
description
of
the
various
theories
of
the
world
formation
by
the
first
theory
the
world
is
supposed
to
have
existed
from
eternity
under
its
actual
form
aristotle
embraced
this
doctrine
and
conceived
the
universe
to
be
the
eternal
effect
of
an
eternal
cause
maintaining
that
not
only
the
heavens
and
the
earth
but
all
animate
and
inanimate
beings
are
without
beginning
to
use
illustration
if
you
can
imagine
a
spectator
on
the
earth
however
far
back
in
time
he
would
have
seen
a
world
essentially
similar
though
not
perhaps
in
all
its
details
to
that
which
now
exists
the
animals
which
existed
would
be
the
ancestors
of
those
which
now
exist
and
like
them
the
plants
in
like
manner
would
be
such
as
we
have
now
and
like
them
and
the
supposition
is
that
at
however
distant
a
period
of
time
you
place
your
observer
he
would
still
find
mountains
lands
and
waters
with
animal
and
vegetable
products
flourishing
upon
them
and
sporting
in
them
just
as
he
finds
now
this
theory
being
perfectly
inconsistent
with
facts
had
to
be
abandoned
the
second
theory
considers
the
universe
eternal
but
not
its
form
this
was
the
system
of
epicurus
and
most
of
the
ancient
philosophers
and
poets
who
imagined
the
world
either
to
be
produced
by
fortuitous
concourse
of
atoms
existing
from
all
eternity
or
to
have
sprung
out
of
the
chaotic
form
which
preceded
its
present
state
by
this
theory
the
matter
and
form
of
the
earth
is
ascribed
to
the
direct
agency
of
a
spiritual
cause
it
is
needless
to
say
that
this
last
theory
has
for
its
basis
the
popular
account
generally
credited
to
moses
in
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
i
say
popular
for
it
certainly
is
not
a
scientific
account
nor
was
it
the
intention
of
the
writer
to
make
it
so
the
supposed
object
was
to
show
the
relation
between
the
creator
and
his
works
if
it
had
been
an
ultimate
scientific
account
the
ablest
minds
of
would
be
unable
to
comprehend
it
as
science
is
progressive
and
constantly
changing
in
fifty
thousand
years
to
come
it
would
still
appear
utterly
absurd
it
can
not
be
said
for
this
fact
that
the
account
is
any
the
less
true
because
it
is
not
presented
in
scientific
phraseology
for
instance
when
we
remark
in
popular
language
the
sun
rises
who
shall
say
that
though
the
expression
is
not
astronomically
true
we
do
not
for
all
practical
purposes
utter
as
important
a
truth
as
when
we
say
the
earth
by
its
revolution
brings
us
to
that
point
where
the
sun
becomes
visible
the
language
also
in
which
the
writer
wrote
was
very
imperfect
it
had
no
equivalent
to
our
word
air
or
atmosphere
properly
speaking
for
they
knew
not
the
words
their
nearest
approaches
according
to
pye
smith
were
with
words
that
denoted
watery
vapor
condensed
and
thus
rendered
visible
whether
floating
around
them
or
seen
in
the
breathing
of
animals
and
words
for
smoke
from
substances
burning
and
for
air
in
motion
wind
a
zephyr
whisper
or
a
storm
it
must
also
be
remembered
that
the
hebrews
had
no
term
for
the
abstract
ideas
which
we
express
by
or
if
the
writer
had
designed
to
express
the
idea
the
beginning
god
created
he
could
not
have
found
words
to
serve
his
purpose

the
slow
loris
after
and
natural
history
by
it
is
unnecessary
to
state
how
the
bible
which
contains
the
mosaic
account
is
regarded
by
the
different
church
denominations
as
undoubtedly
that
is
familiar
to
every
one
but
with
respect
to
the
view
entertained
by
the
scientist
and
critical
school
of
biblical
scholars
represented
chiefly
by
modern
germans
i
may
state
briefly
they
regard
the
bible
as
the
human
record
of
a
divine
revelation
not
absolutely
infallible
since
there
is
no
book
written
in
any
human
language
but
must
partake
in
a
measure
of
the
imperfections
of
that
language
many
of
this
school
while
admitting
the
bible
to
contain
the
record
of
a
true
supernatural
revelation
do
not
consider
it
to
be
without
positive
error
of
historical
fact
not
without
false
coloring
from
popular
legend
and
tradition
but
nevertheless
a
record
as
good
as
human
hands
could
make
a
truly
divine
revelation
there
is
though
a
class
of
thinkers
that
altogether
reject
the
bible
that
is
to
say
refuse
to
believe
it
to
be
a
divine
revelation
hume
whom
huxley
calls
the
most
acute
thinker
of
the
eighteenth
century
thus
ends
one
of
his
essays
if
we
take
in
hand
any
volume
of
divinity
or
school
metaphysics
for
instance
let
us
ask
it
contain
any
abstract
reasoning
concerning
quantity
or
number
no
it
contain
any
experimental
reasoning
concerning
matter
of
fact
and
existence
no
commit
it
then
to
the
flames
for
it
can
contain
nothing
but
sophistry
and
illusion
to
this
huxley
says
permit
me
to
enforce
this
wise
advice
why
trouble
ourselves
about
matters
of
which
however
important
they
may
be
we
do
know
nothing
and
can
know
nothing
we
live
in
a
world
which
is
full
of
misery
and
ignorance
and
the
plain
duty
of
each
and
all
of
us
is
to
try
to
make
the
little
corner
he
can
influence
somewhat
less
miserable
and
somewhat
less
ignorant
than
it
was
before
he
entered
it
to
do
this
effectually
it
is
necessary
to
be
fully
possessed
of
only
two
beliefs
the
first
that
the
order
of
nature
is
ascertainable
by
our
faculties
to
an
extent
which
is
practically
unlimited
the
second
that
our
volitions
count
for
something
as
a
condition
of
the
course
of
events
each
of
these
beliefs
can
be
verified
experimentally
as
often
as
we
like
to
try
each
therefore
stands
upon
the
strongest
foundation
upon
which
any
belief
can
rest
and
forms
one
of
our
highest
truths
the
first
words
in
the
mosaic
account
are
in
the
beginning
god
created
the
heaven
and
the
earth
it
is
seen
then
that
the
revelation
points
to
a
beginning
the
beginning
referred
to
is
an
absolute
beginning
for
we
find
in
the
beginning
was
the
word
and
the
word
was
with
god
and
the
word
was
god
all
things
were
made
by
him
and
without
him
was
not
anything
made
that
was
made
science
points
also
to
a
beginning
geology
points
to
a
time
when
man
did
not
inhabit
the
earth
when
for
him
there
was
a
beginning
so
too
for
lower
organisms
so
too
for
the
rocky
minerals
so
too
for
the
round
world
itself
but
the
beginning
that
science
points
to
is
not
an
absolute
beginning
science
has
to
start
from
some
point
and
that
point
must
have
a
scientific
foundation
the
foundation
of
science
is
matter
which
is
inseparable
from
form
and
force
natural
science
teaches
that
matter
is
eternal
and
imperishable
for
experience
has
never
shown
us
that
even
the
smallest
particle
of
matter
has
come
into
existence
or
passed
away
a
naturalist
says
haeckel
can
no
more
imagine
the
coming
into
existence
of
matter
than
he
can
imagine
its
disappearance
and
he
therefore
looks
upon
the
existing
quantity
of
matter
in
the
universe
as
a
given
fact
the
creation
of
matter
if
indeed
says
haeckel
it
ever
took
place
is
completely
beyond
human
comprehension
and
can
therefore
never
become
a
subject
of
scientific
inquiry
we
can
as
little
imagine
a
of
the
eternal
phenomena
of
the
motion
of
the
universe
as
of
its
final
end
it
is
evident
then
that
the
absolute
beginning
of
the
universe
and
its
absolute
end
are
not
questions
of
science
and
can
be
known
only
as
revealed
by
faith
paul
says
by
faith
we
understand
that
the
world
was
framed
by
the
word
of
god
so
that
things
which
are
seen
were
not
made
of
things
which
appeared

let
us
look
for
a
minute
at
kant
cosmogony
or
as
haeckel
says
kant
cosmological
gas
theory
this
wonderful
theory
says
haeckel
harmonizes
with
all
the
general
series
of
phenomena
at
present
known
to
us
and
stands
in
no
irreconcilable
contradiction
to
any
one
of
them
moreover
it
is
purely
mechanical
and
monistic
makes
use
exclusively
of
the
inherent
forces
of
eternal
matter
and
entirely
excludes
every
supernatural
process
every
prearranged
and
conscious
action
of
a
personal
creator
compare
this
last
statement
with
the
following
i
will
however
says
haeckel
not
deny
that
kant
grand
cosmogony
has
some
weak
points
a
great
unsolved
difficulty
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
cosmological
gas
theory
furnishes
no
at
all
in
explanation
of
the
first
impulse
which
caused
the
rotary
motion
in
the
universe
whewell
has
pointed
out
that
the
nebular
hypothesis
is

of
distribution
of
cosmic
matter
in
space
it
is
seen
then
that
according
to
kant
theory
we
are
to
suppose
that
millions
of
years
ago
there
appeared
a
nebulous
mass
possessing
a
rotary
motion
and
unequally
distributed
through
space
this
is
what
science
calls
a
beginning
and
may
assert
that
every
physical
event
of
a
hundred
million
of
ages
existed
potentially
in
that
nebulous
mass
but
this
is
really
no
explanation
of
the
ultimate
and
real
cause
of
anything
reason
demands
the
cause
of
this
beginning
the
source
that
gave
to
the
nebulous
mass
its
rotary
motion
the
power
that
distributed
the
matter
in
space
the
antecedents
of
the
cosmical
vapor
in
absence
of
antecedents
what
was
the
cause
of
this
of
these
forces
active
in
it
reason
will
never
remain
satisfied
until
these
questions
are
answered
but
physical
science
can
trace
the
thread
no
further
back
and
must
be
dumb
to
all
ulterior
inquiries
it
is
true
then
as
physicists
assert
that
their
science
does
not
mount
actually
to
god

then
in
strict
accordance
with
our
reason
is
to
be
attributed
not
only
the
origination
of
matter
but
all
its
future
developments
when
i
speak
of
matter
it
must
be
understood
that
i
mean
force
for
if
matter
were
not
force
and
immediately
known
as
force
it
could
not
be
known
at
all
could
not
be
rationally
inferred
the
operation
of
force
could
furnish
no
evidence
of
the
existence
of
forceless
matter
if
force
is
not
matter
then
force
can
exist
and
operate
without
matter
its
existence
and
operation
are
no
evidence
of
the
existence
of
matter
and
as
matter
is
forceless
it
can
itself
give
no
evidence
of
its
own
existence
for
that
would
be
an
exercise
of
force
if
force
can
not
exist
and
operate
without
matter
then
force
depends
for
its
existence
and
operation
on
the
forceless
which
destroys
itself
or
force
depends
for
its
existence
on
matter
as
some
property
or
force
and
so
matter
and
force
are
identified
and
force
depends
on
itself
only
as
it
must
the
idea
then
that
force
is
an
attribute
of
matter
and
inherent
in
it
is
absurd
for
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
evidence
that
force
is
or
can
be
an
attribute
of
matter
we
have
no
knowledge
of
the
origin
of
any
force
save
of
that
which
emanates
from
human
volition
all
our
knowledge
of
force
presents
it
as
an
effort
of
intelligent
will
we
are
driven
says
winchell
by
the
necessary
laws
of
thought
to
pronounce
those
energies
styled
gravitation
heat
chemical
affinity
and
their
correlates
nothing
less
than
intelligent
will
but
as
it
is
not
human
will
which
energizes
in
whirlwind
and
the
comet
it
must
be
divine
will
in
all
cases
the
creative
power
of
god
is
an
act
of
power
and
the
power
does
not
perish
with
its
inception
but
continues
to
operate
until
the
act
is
reversed
and
undone
so
that
everything
that
god
has
created
constitutes
a
positive
and
intrinsic
force
though
borrowed
from
him
every
incident
runs
back
to
god
as
its
originator
and
real
cause
the
true
philosophical
doctrine
makes
god
distinct
from
all
his
works
and
yet
acting
in
them
this
doctrine
has
been
held
by
the
greatest
thinkers
the
world
has
ever
produced
such
as
descartes
lerbrisky
berkeley
herschel
faraday
and
a
multitude
of
others
it
seems
to
be
required
says
mccosh
by
that
deep
law
of
causation
which
not
only
prompts
us
to
seek
for
a
law
in
everything
but
an
adequate
cause
to
be
found
only
in
an
intelligent
mind
our
greatest
american
thinker
jonathan
edwards
says
mccosh
whom
i
can
claim
as
my
predecessor
maintains
that
as
an
image
in
a
mirror
is
kept
up
by
a
constant
succession
of
rays
of
light
so
nature
is
sustained
by
a
constant
of
the
divine
power
in
this
view
nature
is
a
perpetual
creation
god
is
to
be
seen
not
only
in
creation
at
first
but
in
the
continuance
of
all
things
they
continue
to
this
day
according
to
thine
ordinances
returning
now
to
the
history
of
the
creation
given
by
moses
haeckel
says
although
moses
looks
upon
the
results
of
the
great
laws
of
organic
development
as
the
direct
actions
of
a
constructing
creator
yet
in
his
theory
there
lies
hidden
the
ruling
idea
of
a
progressive
development
and
a
differentiation
of
the
originally
simple
matter
we
can
therefore
bestow
our
just
and
sincere
admiration
on
the
jewish
lawgiver
grand
insight
into
nature
without
discovering
in
it
a
revelation
that
it
can
not
be
such
is
clear
from
the
fact
that
two
great
fundamental
errors
are
asserted
in
it
namely
first
the
error
that
the
earth
is
the
fixed
central
point
of
the
whole
universe
round
which
the
sun
moon
and
stars
move
and
secondly
the
error
that
man
is
the
premeditated
aim
of
the
creation
of
the
world
for
whose
service
alone
all
the
rest
of
nature
is
said
to
have
been
created
the
former
of
these
errors
was
demolished
by
copernicus
system
of
the
universe
in
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
latter
by
lamarck
doctrine
of
descent
in
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century

of
huxley
in
his
lecture
on
evidences
of
evolution
spoke
of
the
mosaic
account
as
milton
hypothesis
first
because
says
huxley
we
are
now
assured
upon
the
authority
of
the
highest
critics
and
even
of
dignitaries
of
the
church
that
there
is
no
evidence
whatever
that
moses
ever
wrote
this
chapter
or
knew
anything
about
it
and
second
as
this
hypothesis
is
presented
in
milton
work
on
paradise
lost
it
is
appropriate
to
call
it
the
miltonic
hypothesis
in
the
miltonic
account
says
huxley
the
order
in
which
animals
should
have
made
their
appearance
in
the
stratified
rocks
would
be
this
fishes
including
the
great
whale
and
birds
after
that
all
the
varieties
of
terrestrial
animals
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
facts
as
we
find
them
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
know
of
not
the
slightest
evidence
of
the
existence
of
birds
before
the
jurassic
and
perhaps
the
triassic
formations
if
there
were
any
parallel
between
the
miltonic
account
and
the
circumstantial
evidence
we
ought
to
have
abundant
evidence
in
the
devonian
the
silurian
and
carboniferous
rocks
i
need
not
tell
you
that
this
is
not
the
case
and
that
not
a
trace
of
birds
makes
its
appearance
until
the
far
later
period
which
i
have
mentioned
and
again
if
it
be
true
that
all
varieties
of
fishes
and
the
great
whales
and
the
like
made
their
appearance
on
the
fifth
day
then
we
ought
to
find
the
remains
of
these
things
in
the
older
rocks
in
those
which
preceded
the
carboniferous
epoch
fishes
it
is
true
we
find
and
numerous
ones
but
the
great
whales
are
absent
and
the
fishes
are
not
such
as
now
live
not
one
solitary
species
of
fish
now
in
existence
is
to
be
found
there
and
hence
you
are
introduced
again
to
the
difficulty
to
the
dilemma
that
either
the
creatures
that
were
created
then
which
came
into
existence
the
sixth
day
were
not
those
which
are
found
at
present
or
are
not
the
direct
and
immediate
predecessors
of
those
which
now
exist
but
in
that
case
you
must
either
have
had
a
fresh
species
of
which
nothing
has
been
said
or
else
the
whole
story
must
be
given
up
as
absolutely
devoid
of
any
circumstantial
evidence
it
is
for
these
and
many
other
reasons
that
i
feel
bound
to
omit
the
mosaic
account
no
matter
how
near
some
portions
of
it
coincide
with
the
facts
the
earth
has
opened
out
to
the
scientist
kant
cosmogony
it
is
maintained
by
kant
cosmogony
that
every
substance
be
it
solid
or
liquid
constituting
the
entire
universe
was
inconceivable
ages
ago
in
their
homogeneous
gaseous
or
nebulous
condition
owing
to
an
impulse
being
given
to
the
nebulous
mass
it
acquired
a
rotary
movement
which
divided
the
nebulous
mass
up
into
a
number
of
masses
which
owing
to
the
rotation
acquired
greater
density
than
the
remaining
gaseous
mass
and
then
acted
on
the
latter
as
central
points
of
attraction
our
solar
system
was
thus
a
gigantic
gaseous
or
nebulous
ball
all
the
particles
of
which
revolved
around
a
common
central
point
the
solar
nucleus
this
nebulous
ball
assumed
by
its
continual
rotation
a
more
or
less
flattened
spheroidal
form
by
the
continual
revolution
of
this
mass
under
the
influence
of
the
centripetal
and
centrifugal
forces
a
circular
nebular
ring
separated
like
the
present
ring
around
saturn
from
the
rotating
ball
in
time
the
nebulous
ring
condensed
to
a
planet
which
began
to
revolve
around
its
own
axis
when
the
centrifugal
force
became
more
powerful
than
the
centripetal
force
in
the
planet
rings
were
formed
which
in
turn
formed
planets
which
revolved
around
their
axes
as
also
around
their
planets
as
the
latter
moved
around
the
sun
and
thus
arose
the
moons
only
one
of
which
moves
around
our
earth
while
four
move
around
jupiter
and
six
around
uranus
this
order
of
things
was
repeated
over
and
over
again
until
thereby
arose
the
different
solar
systems
the
planets
rotating
around
their
central
suns
and
the
satellites
or
moons
moving
around
their
planets
by
a
continuous
increasing
of
refrigeration
and
condensation
a
fiery
fluid
or
molten
state
occurred
in
these
rotating
bodies
they
then
emitted
an
enormous
amount
of
heat
by
rapid
condensation
and
the
rotating
bodies
suns
planets
and
moons
soon
became
glowing
balls
of
fire
emitting
light
and
heat
the
part
of
a
pound
of
magnesium
wire
burning
in
the
open
air
will
give
a
light
which
will
last
during
one
second
and
can
be
seen
at
a
distance
of
thirty
miles
imagine
then
what
the
light
would
be
from
these
huge
balls
of
fire
floating
through
space
the
earth
forms
a
small
part
nay
even
the
sun
whose
mass
is
equal
to
earths
like
ours
is
but
an
infinitesimal
portion
of
the
whole
by
the
continual
emitting
of
heat
however
these
fiery
balls
had
a
crust
form
on
the
outside
which
enclosed
a
fiery
fluid
nucleus
the
crust
for
a
time
must
have
been
a
smooth
sheet
but
afterward
very
uneven
having
protuberances
and
cavities
form
over
its
surface
owing
to
the
molten
mass
within
becoming
condensed
and
contracted
the
crust
not
following
this
change
sufficiently
close
must
have
fallen
in
and
thus
produced
the
cavities

some
of
the
laws
of

as
also
some
of
the
connecting
links
which
blend
one
stage
of

with
another
which
at

would
seem
unexplainable

it
will
of
course
be
impossible
to
consider
even
hastily
all
of
the
inductive
evidence
belonging
to
the
several
groups
mentioned
above
for
the
scope
of
this
work
would
not
permit
of
it
only
such
facts
as
present
themselves
most
forcibly
to
the
mind
will
be
considered
darwinism
as
has
already
been
stated
is
not
the
doctrine
of
evolution
it
is
however
a
successful
attempt
to
explain
the
law
or
manner
of
evolution
the
of
natural
pointed
out
by
darwin
is
called
by
herbert
spencer
struggle
for
darwin
discovered
that
natural
selection
produces
fitness
between
organisms
and
their
circumstances
which
explains
the
law
of
survival
of
the
it
is
a
fact
that
man
can
by
pursuing
a
certain
method
of
breeding
or
cultivation
improve
and
in
various
ways
modify
the
character
of
the
different
domestic
animals
and
plants
by
always
selecting
the
best
specimen
from
which
to
propagate
the
race
those
features
which
it
is
desired
to
perpetuate
become
more
and
more
developed
so
that
what
are
admitted
to
be
real
varieties
sometimes
acquire
in
the
course
of
successive
generations
a
character
as
strikingly
distinct
to
all
appearances
from
those
of
the
varieties
as
one
species
is
from
another
species
of
the
same
genus
it
is
evident
that
both
natural
and
artificial
selection
depends
on
adaptation
and
inheritance
the
difference
between
the
two
forms
of
selection
is
that
in
the
first
case
the
will
of
man
makes
the
selection
according
to
a
plan
whereas
in
natural
selection
the
struggle
for
life
and
the
survival
of
the
fittest
acts
without
a
plan
other
than
that
the
most
adaptable
organism
shall
survive
which
is
most
fit
to
contend
with
the
circumstances
under
which
it
is
placed
natural
selection
acts
therefore
much
more
slowly
than
artificial
selection
although
it
brings
about
the
same
end
adaptation
in
the
struggle
for
life
is
an
absolute
necessity
in
every
act
of
breeding
a
certain
amount
of
protoplasm
is
transferred
from
the
parents
to
the
child
and
along
with
it
there
is
transferred
the
individual
peculiar
molecular
motion
adaptation
or
transmutation
depends
upon
the
material
influence
which
organism
experiences
from
its
surroundings
or
its
conditions
of
existence
while
the
transmission
from
inheritance
is
due
to
the
partial
identity
of
producing
and
produced
organisms
organized
beings
as
a
rule
are
gifted
with
enormous
powers
of
increase
wild
plants
yield
their
crop
of
seed
annually
and
most
wild
animals
bring
forth
their
young
yearly
or
oftener
should
this
process
go
on
unchecked
in
a
short
time
the
earth
would
be
completely
overrun
with
living
beings
it
has
been
calculated
that
if
a
plant
produces
fifty
seeds
which
is
far
below
the
reproductive
capacity
of
many
plants
the
first
year
each
of
these
seeds
growing
up
into
a
plant
which
produces
fifty
seeds
or
altogether
two
thousand
five
hundred
seeds
the
next

and
so
on
it
would
under
favorable
conditions

give

occur
in

assuming
the
former
rate
of

and
taking
the

millions
of
species
are
doing

so
that
the

result
of

strife
can
not

of

those

that
portion
of
the

which

the

of

and

from

be

lamarckism
progress
is
recognized
by
all
scientists
to
be
a
law
of
nature
some
of
the
more
important
facts
which
sustain
the
theory
of
development
i
propose
now
to
present
as
briefly
as
possible
rudimentary
organs
one
of
the
strongest
arguments
in
favor
of
the
hypothesis
of
a
genetic
connection
among
all
animals
including
man
at
least
among
all
those
belonging
to
the
same
great
types
is
the
presence
of
rudimentary
parts
by
rudiments
in
anatomy
are
meant
organs
or
structures
imperfectly
developed
so
as
to
be
almost
or
entirely
without
functional
use
each
of
them
represents
in
germ
as
it
were
in
one
animal
or
plant
that
which
is
perfect
and
useful
in
another
type
for
a
few
examples
the
little
fold
of
caruncle
at
the
inner
margin
of
the
eye
in
man
represents
the
nictitating
membrane
of
birds
eyes
which
do
not
see
form
a
striking
example
these
are
found
in
very
many
animals
which
live
in
the
dark
as
in
caves
or
underground
their
eyes
are
often
perfectly
developed
but
are
covered
by
a
membrane
so
that
no
ray
of
light
can
enter
and
they
can
never
see
such
eyes
without
the
function
of
sight
are
found
in
several
species
of
moles
and
mice
which
live
underground
in
serpents
and
lizards
in
amphibious
animals
proteus
cæcilia
and
in
fishes
also
in
numerous
invertebrate
animals
which
pass
their
lives
in
the
dark
as
do
many
beetles
crabs
snails
worms
etc
other
rudimentary
organs
are
the
wings
of
animals
which
can
not
fly
for
example
the
wings
of
the
running
birds
like
the
ostrich
emeu
cassowary
the
legs
of
which
become
exceedingly
developed
the
muscles
which
move
the
ears
of
animals
are
still
present
in
man
but
of
course
are
of
no
use
by
continual
practice
persons
have
been
able
to
move
their
ears
by
these
muscles
the
rudiment
of
the
tail
of
animals
which
man
possesses
in
his
tail
vertebræ
is
another
rudimentary
part
in
the
human
embryo
it
stands
out
prominently
during
the
first
two
months
of
its
development
it
afterwards
becomes
hidden
the
rudimentary
little
tail
of
man
is
irrefutable
proof
that
he
is
descended
from
tailed
ancestors
in
woman
the
tail
is
generally
by
one
vertebra
longer
than
in
man
there
still
exists
rudimentary
muscles
in
the
human
tail
which
formerly
moved
it
another
case
of
human
rudimentary
organs
only
belonging
to
the
male
and
which
obtains
in
like
manner
in
all
mammals
is
furnished
by
the
mammary
glands
on
the
breast
which
as
a
rule
are
active
only
in
the
female
sex
however
cases
of
different
mammals
are
known
especially
of
men
sheep
and
goats
in
which
the
mammary
glands
were
fully
developed
in
the
male
sex
and
yield
milk
as
food
for
their
offspring
the
vermiform
appendix
of
the
large
intestine
in
man
is
another
illustration
of
a
part
which
has
no
use
but
in
one
marsupial
is
three
times
the
length
of
its
body
the
rudimentary
covering
of
hair
over
certain
portions
of
the
body
is
not
without
interest
over
the
body
we
find
but
a
scanty
covering
which
is
thick
only
on
the
head
in
the
armpits
and
on
some
other
parts
of
the
body
the
short
hairs
on
the
greater
part
of
the
body
are
entirely
useless
and
are
the
last
scanty
remains
of
the
hairy
covering
of
our
ape
ancestors
both
on
the
upper
and
lower
arm
the
hairs
are
directed
toward
the
elbow
where
they
meet
at
an
obtuse
angle
this
striking
arrangement
is
only
found
in
man
and
the
anthropoid
apes
the
gorilla
chimpanzee
orang
and
several
species
of
gibbons
the
fine
short
hairs
on
the
body
become
developed
into
thickset
long
and
rather
coarse
dark
hairs
when
abnormally
nourished
near
inflamed
surfaces
the
fine
hair
or
lanugo
with
which
the
human
foetus
during
the
fifth
and
sixth
months
is
thickly
covered
offers
another
proof
that
man
is
descended
from
an
animal
which
was
born
hairy
and
remained
so
during
life
this
covering
is
first
developed
during
the
fifth
month
on
the
eyebrows
and
face
and
especially
around
the
mouth
where
it
is
much
longer
than
that
on
the
head
three
or
four
cases
have
been
recorded
of
persons
born
with
their
whole
bodies
and
faces
thickly
covered
with
fine
long
hairs
alex
brandt
compared
the
hair
from
the
face
of
a
man
thus
characterized
aged
with
the
lanugo
of
a
foetus
and
finds
it
quite
similar
in
texture
eschricht
has
devoted
great
attention
to
this
rudimentary
covering
and
has
thrown
much
light
on
the
subject
he
showed
that
the
female
as
well
as
the
male
foetus
possessed
this
hairy
covering
showing
that
both
are
descended
from
progenitors
both
sexes
of
whom
were
hairy
eschricht
also
showed
as
stated
above
that
the
hair
on
the
face
of
the
fifth
month
foetus
is
longer
on
the
face
than
on
the
head
which
indicates
that
our
progenitors
were
not
furnished
with
long
tresses
which
must
therefore
have
been
a
late
acquisition
the
question
naturally
arises
is
there
any
explanation
for
the
loss
of
hair
covering
illustration
fig
the
burmese
family
from
scientific
american
darwin
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
absence
of
hair
on
the
body
is
to
a
certain
extent
a
secondary
sexual
character
for
in
all
parts
of
the
world
women
are
less
hairy
than
men
he
says
therefore
we
may
reasonably
suspect
that
this
character
has
been
gained
through
sexual
selection
as
the
body
in
woman
is
less
hairy
than
in
man
and
as
this
character
is
common
to
all
races
we
may
conclude
that
it
was
our
female
ancestors
who
were
first
divested
of
hair
professor
grant
allen
has
given
much
study
to
the
subject
of
the
loss
of
hair
in
the
human
being
and
his
investigations
are
worthy
of
careful
consideration
he
shows
conclusively
that
those
parts
of
an
animal
which
are
in
constant
contact
with
other
objects
are
specially
liable
to
lose
their
hair
this
is
noticeable
on
the
under
surface
of
the
body
of
all
animals
which
habitually
lie
on
the
stomach
the
soles
of
the
feet
of
all
mammals
where
they
touch
the
ground
are
quite
hairless
the
palms
of
the
hands
in
the
quadrumana
present
the
same
appearance
the
knees
of
those
species
which
frequently
kneel
such
as
camels
and
other
ruminants
are
apt
to
become
bare
and
the
friction
of
the
water
has
been
the
means
of
removing
the
hair
from
many
aquatic
mammals
the
whales
porpoises
dugongs
and
manatees
are
examples
as
the
back
of
man
forms
the
specially
hairless
region
of
his
body
we
must
conclude
that
it
is
in
all
probability
the
first
part
which
became
entirely
denuded
of
hair
the
gorilla
according
to
professor
gervais
is
the
only
mammal
which
agrees
with
man
in
having
the
hair
thinner
on
the
back
where
it
is
partly
rubbed
off
than
on
the
lower
surface
du
chaillu
states
that
he
has
himself
come
upon
fresh
traces
of
a
gorilla
bed
on
several
occasions
and
could
see
that
the
male
had
seated
himself
with
his
back
against
a
he
also
says
in
both
male
and
female
the
hair
is
found
worn
off
the
back
but
this
is
only
found
in
very
old
females
this
is
occasioned
i
suppose
by
their
resting
at
night
against
trees
at
whose
base
they
sleep
the
gorilla
has
only
very
partially
acquired
the
erect
position
and
probably
sits
but
little
in
the
attitude
common
to
man
in
man
the
case
is
different
in
proportion
as
his
progenitors
grew
more
and
more
erect
he
must
have
lain
less
and
less
upon
his
stomach
and
more
and
more
upon
his
back
or
sides
and
this
is
seen
in
the
savage
man
during
his
lazy
hours
who
stretches
himself
on
the
ground
in
the
sun
with
his
back
propped
where
possible
by
a
slight
mound
or
the
wall
of
his
hut
the
continual
friction
of
the
surface
of
the
back
would
arrest
the
growth
of
hair
for
hair
grows
where
there
is
normally
less
friction
and
as
man
became
more
and
more
hairless
especially
among
savage
and
naked
races
we
should
conclude
that
such
a
modification
would
be
considered
a
beauty
and
women
would
select
such
men
in
preference
to
more
hairy
individuals
the
new
zealand
proverb
is
there
is
no
woman
for
a
hairy
man
sexual
selection
then
would
play
a
very
important
part
and
the
difficulty
of
understanding
how
man
became
divested
of
hair
is
readily
explained
haeckel
says
even
if
we
knew
absolutely
nothing
of
the
other
phenomena
of
development
we
should
be
obliged
to
believe
in
the
truth
of
the
theory
of
descent
solely
on
the
ground
of
the
existence
of
rudimentary
organs
reproduction
by
means
of
eggs
it
might
be
thought
there
existed
a
missing
link
between
animals
which
lay
eggs
and
those
which
do
not
this
however
is
done
away
with
in
many
instances
one
for
example
is
found
in
our
commonest
indigenous
snake
the
ringed
snake
lays
eggs
which
require
three
weeks
time
to
develop
but
when
it
is
kept
in
captivity
and
no
sand
is
strewn
in
the
cage
it
does
not
lay
eggs
but
retains
them
until
the
young
ones
are
developed
this
only
shows
how
powerfully
influences
affect
the
habit
of
animals
individuals
another
difficulty
might
be
supposed
to
arise
between
animals
which
produce
themselves
other
than
by
sexual
reproduction
this
has
already
been
slightly
touched
upon
and
it
has
been
shown
that
numerous
plants
and
animals
propagate
themselves
through
their
organs
it
occurs
in
a
great
majority
of
plants
but
only
in
a
minority
of
animals
for
example
the
leeches
and
many
other
worms
every
produces
in
one
part
of
its
sexual
gland
eggs
and
in
another
part
sperm
parthenogenesis
offers
an
interesting
form
of
transition
from
sexual
reproduction
to
the
formation
of
which
most
resembles
it
it
has
been
demonstrated
to
occur
in
many
cases
among
insects
especially
by
seebold
excellent
investigations
among
the
common
bees
a
male
individual
a
drone
arises
out
of
the
eggs
of
the
queen
if
the
eggs
have
not
been
fructified
a
female
a
queen
or
working
bee
if
the
egg
has
been
fructified
gonochorismus
or
sexual
separation
which
characterizes
the
more
complicated
of
the
two
kinds
of
sexual
reproduction
has
evidently
been
developed
from
the
condition
of
hermaphroditism
at
a
late
period
of
the
organic
history
of
the
world
in
this
case
the
female
individual
in
both
animal
and
plant
produces
eggs
or
in
animals
the
male
individual
secretes
the
fructifying
sperm
sperma
in
plants
the
corpuscles
which
correspond
to
the
sperm
inheritance
the
remarkable
facts
of
inheritance
extending
to
the
reproduction
of
unimportant
peculiarities
of
parts
or
organs
rudimentary
parts
mentioned
above
and
the
occasional
outbreak
of
ancestral
characters
that
have
been
dormant
through
several
generations
some
of
which
i
will
mention
further
on
might
be
thought
perfectly
unexplainable
but
they
are
readily
accounted
for
by
the
supposition
that
each
part
of
an
organism
contributes
its
constituent
and
effective
molecules
to
the
germ
and
sperm
particles
sorby
made
numerous
investigations
with
relation
to
the
number
of
molecules
in
the
germinal
matter
of
eggs
and
the
spermatic
matter
supplied
by
the
male
omitting
the
alkali
sorby
takes
the
formula
c
h
n
so
as
representing
the
composition
of
albumen
in
a
of
an
inch
cube
he
reckons
albumen
molecules
water
molecules
or
in
a
sphere
of
the
same
diameter
of
the
two
components
taking
a
single
mammalian
spermatozoon
having
a
mean
diameter
of
of
an
inch
it
might
contain
two
and
a
half
million
of
such
gemmules
if
these
were
lost
destroyed
or
fully
developed
at
the
rate
of
one
in
each
second
this
number
would
be
exhausted
in
about
one
month
but
since
a
number
of
spermatozoa
appears
to
be
necessary
to
produce
perfect
fertilization
it
is
quite
easy
to
understand
that
the
number
of
gemmules
introduced
into
the
ovum
may
be
so
great
that
the
influence
of
the
male
parent
may
be
very
marked
even
after
having
been
as
regards
particular
character
apparently
dormant
for
many
years
the
germinal
vesicle
of
a
mammalian
ovum
being
about
of
an
inch
mean
diameter
might
contain
five
hundred
million
of
gemmules
which
if
used
up
at
the
rate
of
one
per
second
would
last
more
than
seventeen
years
if
the
whole
ovum
about
in
diameter
were
all
gemmules
the
number
would
be
sufficient
to
last
at
this
rate
one
per
second
for
years
this
however
is
not
probable
but
sorby
remarks
has
completely
removed
all
doubt
as
to
its
physical
possibility
from
the
darwinian
theory
and
they
prompt
us
says
slack
to
a
wonderful
conception
of
the
powers
residing
in
minute
quantities
of
matter
the
laws
of
inheritance
are
divisible
into
two
series
conservative
and
progressive
transmission
the
laws
of
adaptation
to
direct
active
or
indirect
potential
adaptation
external
causes
often
influence
the
reproductive
system
especially
in
organism
propagating
in
a
sexual
way
this
can
be
strikingly
shown
in
artificially
produced
monstrosities
monstrosities
can
be
produced
by
subjecting
the
parental
organism
to
certain
extraordinary
conditions
of
life
and
curiously
enough
such
an
extraordinary
condition
of
life
does
not
produce
a
change
of
the
organism
itself
but
a
change
in
its
descendants
the
new
formation
exists
in
the
parental
organism
only
as
a
possibility
potential
in
the
descendants
it
becomes
a
reality
actual
most
commonly
monstrosities
with
very
abnormal
forms
are
sterile
but
there
are
instances
where
they
reproduce
their
kind
and
become
a
species
geoffroy
hilaire
who
perhaps
made
the
deepest
investigations
ever
conducted
into
the
nature
and
causes
of
their
production
first
conceived
the
idea
of
artificially
producing
them
and
to
this
end
he
began
modifications
of
the
physical
conditions
of
the
evolution
of
the
chicken
during
natural
and
artificial
incubation
he
determined
the
fact
that
monsters
could
be
produced
in
this
way
but
scarcely
carried
his
investigation
further
this
work
has
been
taken
up
by
dareste
and
he
has
lately
published
a
volume
in
paris
which
recounts
the
results
of
a
quarter
of
a
century
experimenting
eggs
he
states
were
submitted
to
incubation
in
a
vertical
instead
of
a
horizontal
position
they
were
covered
with
varnish
in
certain
places
so
as
to
stop
or
modify
evaporation
and
respiration
the
evolution
of
the
chick
was
rendered
slower
by
a
temperature
below
that
of
the
normal
heat
of
incubation
finally
eggs
were
warmed
only
at
one
point
so
that
the
young
animal
during
development
was
submitted
at
different
parts
to
variable
temperatures

the

observed

has
been
that
of

protruding

this

a
most
extraordinary

a

a
curious
fact
discovered
is
the
duplicity
of
the
heart
at
the
beginning
of
incubation
two
hearts
beating

clearly
seen

the

of
which
takes
place
in
a
peculiar
state
of
the
cicatricule
before
incubation
but
having
submitted
to
incubation
some
eggs
he
has
obtained
several
remarkable
examples
of
double
monstrosities
in
process
of
formation
some
representations
of
which
are
given
herewith

three

all
derived

three

from

cicatricules
on

are
two
imperfectly

the

a

with

the

are
separate
and
there
are
three
upper
and
three
lower

of
the
latter
on

belonging
equally

the

acquired
qualities
when
an
organism
has
been
subjected
to
abnormal
conditions
in
life
it
can
transmit
any
peculiarity
it
may
have
acquired
this
is
however
not
always
possible
otherwise
descendants
of
men
who
have
lost
their
arm
or
leg
would
be
born
without
the
corresponding
arm
or
leg
this
shows
that
some
acquired
qualities
are
more
easily
transmitted
than
others
although
there
are
cases
as
for
instance
a
race
of
dogs
without
tails
has
been
produced
by
cutting
off
the
tails
of
both
sexes
of
the
dog
during
several
generations
a
few
years
ago
says
haeckel
a
case
occurred
on
an
estate
near
jena
in
which
by
the
careless
slamming
of
a
the
tail
of
a
bull
was
wrenched
off
and
the
calves
begotten
by
this
bull
were
all
born
without
a
tail
this
is
certainly
an
exception
but
it
is
very
important
to
note
the
fact
that
under
certain
unknown
conditions
such
violent
changes
are
transmitted
in
the
same
manner
as
many
diseases
the
transmission
of
diseases
such
as
consumption
madness
and
albinism
form
examples
albinoes
are
those
individuals
who
are
distinguished
by
the
absence
of
coloring
matter
from
their
skins
they
are
of
frequent
occurrence
among
men
animals
and
plants
among
many
animals
such
as
rabbits
and
mice
albinoes
with
white
fur
and
red
eyes
are
so
much
liked
that
they
are
propagated
this
would
be
impossible
were
it
not
for
the
law
of
the
transmission
of
adaptations
hornless
cattle
have
descended
from
a
single
bull
born
in
of
horned
parents
but
whose
absence
of
horns
was
the
result
of
some
unknown
cause
the
law
of
interrupted
or
latent
transmission
as
illustrated
in
grandchildren
who
are
like
the
grandparents
but
quite
unlike
the
parents
animals
often
resume
a
form
which
have
not
existed
for
many
generations
one
of
the
most
remarkable
instances
of
this
kind
of
reversion
or
atavism
is
the
fact
that
in
some
horses
there
sometimes
appear
singular
dark
stripes
similar
to
those
of
the
zebra
quagga
and
other
wild
species
of
african
horse
nutrition
directly
modifies
adaptation
as
is
well
illustrated
by
animals
which
have
been
bred
for
domestic
or
other
purposes
if
a
farmer
is
breeding
for
fine
wool
he
gives
much
different
food
to
the
sheep
than
he
would
if
he
wished
to
obtain
flesh
or
an
abundance
of
fat
even
the
bodily
form
of
man
is
quite
different
according
to
its
nutrition
food
containing
much
nitrogen
produces
little
fat
that
containing
little
nitrogen
produces
a
great
deal
of
fat
people
who
by
means
of
system
at
present
so
popular
wish
to
become
thin
eat
only
meat
and
eggs
no
bread
no
potatoes
man
can
breed
for
milk
in
cattle
for
feathers
in
pigeons
for
colored
flowers
in
plants
and
in
fact
for
almost
any
desirable
quality
geological
record
geological
palæontology
furnishes
weighty
evidence
of
man
descent
for
the
circumstantial
evidence
derived
from
this
source
is
written
without
the
possibility
of
a
mistake
with
no
chance
of
error
on
the
stratified
rocks
it
is
true
that
the
geological
record
must
be
incomplete
because
it
can
only
preserve
remains
found
in
certain
favorable
localities
and
under
particular
conditions
that
this
valuable
record
must
be
destroyed
by
processes
of
denudation
and
obliterated
by
processes
of
metamorphosis
it
can
not
be
doubted
beds
of
rock
of
any
thickness
crammed
full
of
organic
remains
may
yet
says
huxley
by
the
percolation
of
water
through
them
or
the
influence
of
subterranean
heat
if
they
descend
far
enough
toward
the
centre
of
the
earth
lose
all
trace
of
these
remains
and
present
the
appearance
of
beds
of
rock
formed
under
conditions
in
which
there
was
no
trace
of
living
forms
such
metamorphic
rocks
occur
in
formations
of
all
ages
and
we
know
with
perfect
certainty
when
they
do
appear
that
they
have
contained
organic
remains
and
that
those
remains
have
been
absolutely
obliterated
if
we
look
at
the
geological
record
we
find
the
first
or
primordial
epoch
constitutes
the
of
animals
and
and
is
made
up
of
the
laurentian
cambrian
and
silurian
period
the
second
or
primary
epoch
constitutes
the
of
fishes
and
fern
and
is
made
up
of
the
devonian
coal
and
permian
period
the
third
or
secondary
epoch
constitutes
the
of
reptiles
and
pine
forests
and
is
made
up
of
the
triassic
jurassic
and
chalk
period
the
fourth
or
tertiary
epoch
constitutes
the
of
mammals
and
leaf
and
is
made
up
of
the
eocene
miocene
and
phocene
period
the
fifth
the
or
quaternary
epoch
constitutes
the
of
man
and
cultivated
forests
and
is
made
up
of
the
glacial
and
postglacial
period
and
the
period
of
culture
during
the
archilithic
epoch
the
inhabitants
of
our
planet
as
has
been
already
stated
consisted
of
animals
or
aquatic
forms
no
remains
of
terrestrial
animals
or
plants
dated
from
this
period
have
as
yet
been
found
the
archilithic
period
was
longer
than
the
whole
long
period
between
the
close
of
the
archilithic
and
the
present
time
for
if
the
total
thickness
of
all
sedimentary
strata
be
estimated
as
about
one
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
feet
then
seventy
thousand
feet
belong
to
this
epoch
it
was
during
this
epoch
that
the
little
mass
of
protoplasm
which
has
been
so
often
spoken
of
came
into
existence
it
has
been
stated
above
that
palæontology
is
quite
deficient
this
is
not
only
true
of
the
record
but
of
the
lack
as
yet
of
sufficient
investigations
the
greatest
fields
of
investigation
in
this
department
have
never
been
explored
the
whole
of
the
petrifactions
accurately
known
do
not
probably
amount
to
a
hundredth
part
of
those
which
by
more
elaborate
explorations
are
yet
to
be
discovered
the
most
ancient
of
all
distinctly
preserved
petrifactions
is
the
eozoon
canadense
which
was
found
in
the
lowest
laurentian
strata
in
the
ottawa
formation
probably
no
discovery
in
palæontology
ranks
higher
than
the
discovery
of
the
descendants
of
the
horse
the
horse
for
example
as
far
as
his
limbs
and
teeth
go
differs
far
more
from
extant
graminivora
than
man
differs
from
the
ape
had
not
fossil
ungulates
been
found
which
demonstrate
the
common
origin
of
the
horse
with
didactyles
and
multidactyles
some
would
have
deemed
the
horse
a
special
miraculous
creation
but
now
the
links
are
complete
and
the
descent
of
the
horse
is
found
to
follow
exactly
what
the
doctrine
of
evolution
could
have
predicted
ontogeny
it
has
been
stated
that
the
palæontological
record
is
quite
incomplete
owing
to
many
facts
some
of
which
have
been
mentioned
fortunately
the
history
of
the
development
of
the
organic
individual
or
ontogeny
comes
in
to
fill
up
many
deficiencies
ontogeny
is
a
repetition
of
the
principal
forms
through
which
the
respective
individuals
have
passed
from
the
beginning
of
their
tribe
and
its
great
advantage
is
that
it
reveals
a
field
of
information
which
it
was
impossible
for
the
rocks
to
retain
for
the
petrification
of
the
ancient
ancestors
of
all
the
different
animal
and
vegetable
species
which
were
soft
tender
bodies
was
not

of

later
comes
that
of
the

also
in
its
higher
mammalian
or
human
traits
at
no
time
in
the
development
of
the
egg
save
at
the
start
do
the
embryos
of
the
various
vertebra
assume
the
or
characteristics
of
one
another
but
they
assimilate
so
closely
that
it
requires
the
eye
of
the
expert
to
distinguish
them
and
as
has
already
been
stated
the
more
closely
an
animal
resembles
another
the
longer
and
the
more
intimately
do
their
embryos
resemble
one
another
so
that
for
example
the
embryo
of
the
snake
and
of
a
lizard
remain
like
one
another
longer
than
do
those
of
a
snake
and
of
a
bird
and
the
embryo
of
a
dog
and
of
a
cat
remain
like
one
another
for
a
far
longer
period
than
do
those
of
a
dog
and
a
bird
or
a
dog
and
an
opossum
or
even
those
of
a
dog
and
a
monkey
surely
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
short
brief
history
given
by
the
development
of
the
egg
is
far
more
wonderful
than
phylogeny
or
the
long
and
slow
history
of
the
development
of
the
tribe
which
has
taken
thousands
of
years
compare
this
time
with
the
time
required
for
the
development
of
the
smallest
mammals
the
harvest
mice
which
develops
in
three
weeks
or
the
smallest
of
all
birds
the
which
quits
the
egg
on
the
twelfth
day
or
with
man
who
passes
through
the
whole
course
of
his
development
in
forty
weeks
or
with
the
rhinoceros
who
requires
years
or
the
elephant
who
requires
ninety
weeks
how
insignificant
are
these
various
periods
to
the
long
period
originally
required
yet
in
these
short
periods
the
whole
phylogeny
is
run
through
in
the
ontogeny
or
the
history
of
the
development
of
the
egg
the
attributes
of
man
we
must
now
consider
briefly
some
of
the
attributes
of
man
and
see
if
he
really
possesses
attributes
which
are
in
no
inferior
degree
possessed
by
animals
before
proceeding
directly
to
the
consideration
of
the
attributes
of
man
it
will
be
best
to
show
the
correlation
that
exists
between
what
are
called
man
vital
forces
and
the
physical
forces
of
nature
to
do
this
let
us
choose
three
forms
of
its
manifestation
these
shall
be
heat
evolved
within
the
body
muscular
energy
or
motion
and
lastly
nervous
energy
or
that
form
of
force
which
on
the
one
hand
stimulates
a
muscle
to
contract
and
on
the
other
appears
in
forms
called
mental
it
will
not
take
any
extensive
argument
to
demonstrate
that
the
heat
of
the
body
does
not
differ
from
heat
from
any
other
source
it
is
known
that
the
food
taken
into
the
body
contains
potential
energy
which
is
capable
of
being
in
part
converted
into
actual
heat
by
oxidation
and
since
we
know
that
the
food
taken
into
the
body
is
oxidized
by
the
oxygen
of
the
air
supplied
by
the
lungs
the
heat
of
the
body
must
be
due
to
the
slow
oxidation
of
the
carbon
perhaps
also
hydrogen
sulphur
and
phosphorus
in
the
food
now
since
this
vital
heat
is
developed
by
oxidation
is
recognized
by
the
same
tests
and
applied
to
the
same
purposes
as
any
other
heat
it
is
as
truly
correlated
to
the
other
forces
as
when
it
has
a
purely
physical
origin
the
amoeboid
activity
of
a
white
blood
corpuscle
is
stimulated
within
certain
limits
by
heat
hatching
of
eggs
and
the
germination
of
seeds
may
be
likewise
hastened
or
retarded
by
access
or
deprivation
of
heat
it
was
considerations
such
as
these
which
led
to
the
doctrine
of
correlation
of
the
vital
and
physical
forces
with
respect
to
the
muscular
force
exerted
by
an
animal
it
was
supposed
that
it
was
created
by
the
animal
frankland
says
to
this
an
animal
can
no
more
generate
an
amount
of
force
capable
of
moving
a
grain
of
sand
than
a
stone
can
fall
upwards
or
a
locomotive
drive
a
train
without
fuel
as
the
amount
of
co
exhaled
by
the
lungs
is
increased
in
the
exact
ratio
of
work
done
by
the
muscle
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
actual
force
of
the
muscle
is
due
to
the
converted
potential
energy
of
the
food
since
every
exertion
of
a
muscle
and
nerves
involves
the
death
and
decay
of
those
tissues
to
a
certain
extent
as
shown
by
the
excretions
orton
has
been
led
to
say
an
animal
begins
to
die
the
moment
it
begins
to
live
a
muscle
says
barker
is
like
a
is
a
machine
for
converting
the
potential
energy
of
carbon
into
motion
but
unlike
a
the
muscle
accomplishes
this
conversion
directly
the
energy
not
passing
through
the
intermediate
stages
of
heat
for
this
reason
the
muscle
is
the
most
economical
producer
of
mechanical
force
known
the
muscles
which
give
the
downward
stroke
of

of
a

are
fastened
to
the
breastbone
and
their
power
in
proportion
to
the
weight
of
the
bird
is
as
to
this
great

the

times
lighter
than
water
the
hawk
being
able
to
travel
miles
an
hour
the
last
of
the
vital
forces
under
consideration
is
that
produced
by
the
nerves
and
nervous
centres
barker
says
in
the
nerve
which
stimulates
a
muscle
to
contract
this
force
is
undeniably
motion
since
it
is
propagated
along
this
nerve
from
one
extremity
to
the
other
this
force
has
been
likened
unto
electricity
the
gray
or
cellular
matter
being
the
battery
the
white
or
fibrous
matter
the
conductors
du
bois
reymond
has
demonstrated
that
this
force
is
not
electricity
though
by
showing
that
its
velocity
is
only
feet
a
second
the
velocity
varies
though
in
different
animals
it
is
according
to
orton
more
rapid
in
than
in
animals
being
nearly
twice
as
fast
in
man
as
in
the
frog
wheatstone
by
his
method
gives
the
velocity
of
electricity
in
copper
wire
at
geographical
miles
per
second
but
as
neither
fizeau
gould
gonnelle
and
others
could
arrive
at
the
same
result
the
method
was
shown
to
be
incorrect
and
it
remained
for
siemen
to
discover
the
true
method
which
gives
the
velocity
just
that
of
wheatstone
estimate
or
geographical
miles
per
second
in
the
opinion
of
bence
jones
the
propagation
of
a
nervous
impulse
is
a
sort
of
successive
molecular
polarization
like
magnetism
but
that
this
agent
is
a
force
as
analogous
to
electricity
as
is
magnetism
is
shown
not
only
by
the
fact
that
the
transmission
of
electricity
along
a
nerve
will
cause
the
contraction
of
a
muscle
to
which
it
leads
but
also
by
the
important
fact
discovered
by
marshall
that
the
contraction
of
a
muscle
is
excited
by
diminishing
its
normal
electrical
current
a
result
which
could
take
place
only
with
a
stimulus
says
barker
closely
allied
to
electricity
nerve
force
must
therefore
be
transmuted
potential
energy
huxley
says
the
results
of
recent
inquiries
into
the
structure
of
the
nervous
system
of
animals
converge
toward
the
conclusion
that
the
which
we
have
hitherto
regarded
as
ultimate
elements
of
nervous
tissue
are
not
such
but
are
simply
the
visible
aggregations
of
vastly
more
attenuated
filaments
the
diameter
of
which
dwindles
down
to
the
limits
of
our
present
microscopic
vision
greatly
as
these
have
been
extended
by
modern
improvements
of
the
microscope
and
that
a
nerve
is
in
its
essence
nothing
but
a
linear
tract
of
specially
modified
protoplasm
between
two
points
of
an
organism
one
of
which
is
able
to
affect
the
other
by
means
of
the
communication
so
established
hence
it
is
conceivable
that
even
the
simplest
living
being
may
possess
a
nervous
system
herbert
spencer
says
all
direct
and
indirect
evidence
justifies
us
in
concluding
that
the
nervous
system
consists
of
kind
of
matter
in
the
gray
tissue
this
matter
exists
in
masses
containing
which
are
soft
and
have
granules
dispersed
through
them
and
which
besides
being
thus
unstably
composed
are
placed
so
as
to
be
liable
to
disturbances
to
the
greatest
degree
in
the
white
tissue
this
matter
is
collected
together
in
extremely
slender
that
are
denser
that
are
uniform
in
texture
and
that
are
shielded
in
an
unusual
manner
from
disturbing
forces
except
at
their
two
extremities
the
last
consideration
is
that
form
of
force
thought
power
which
appears
in
manifestations
called
mental
it
must
be
noticed
at
the
outset
that
every
external
manifestation
of
thought
force
is
a
muscular
one
as
a
word
spoken
or
written
a
gesture
or
an
expression
of
the
face
always
takes
place
hence
this
force
must
be
intimately
correlated
to
nerve
force
it
is
very
certain
then
that
thought
force
is
capable
in
external
manifestations
of
converting
itself
into
actual
motion
but
here
the
question
arises
can
it
be
manifested
inwardly
without
such
a
transformation
of
energy
or
is
the
evolution
of
thought
entirely
independent
of
the
matter
of
the
brain
this
question
can
be
answered
by
actual
experiment
strange
as
it
may
appear
experiments
have
demonstrated
that
any
change
of
temperature
within
the
skull
was
soonest
manifested
externally
in
that
depression
which
exists
just
above
the
occipital
protuberance
here
lombard
fastened
to
the
head
at
this
point
two
little
bars
one
made
of
bismuth
the
other
of
an
alloy
of
antimony
and
zinc
which
were
connected
with
a
delicate
galvanometer
to
neutralize
the
result
of
a
gradual
rise
of
temperature
over
the
whole
body
a
second
pair
of
bars
reversed
in
direction
was
attached
to
the
leg
or
arm
so
that
if
a
like
increase
of
heat
came
to
both
the
electricity
developed
by
one
would
be
neutralized
by
the
other
and
no
effect
would
be
produced
by
the
needle
unless
only
one
was
affected
by
long
practice
it
was
ascertained
that
a
mental
torpor
could
be
induced
lasting
for
hours
in
which
the
needle
remained
stationary
but
let
a
person
knock
on
the
door
outside
of
the
room
or
speak
a
single
word
even
though
the
experimenter
remained
absolutely
passive
the
reception
of
the
intelligence
caused
the
needle
to
swing
twenty
degrees
in
explanation
of
this
production
of
heat
says
barker
the
analogy
of
the
muscle
at
once
suggests
itself
no
conversion
of
energy
is
complete
and
as
the
heat
of
muscular
action
represents
force
which
has
escaped
conversion
into
motion
so
the
heat
evolved
during
the
reception
of
an
idea
is
energy
which
has
escaped
conversion
into
thought
from
precisely
the
same
cause
experiments
have
shown
that
the
amount
of
heat
developed
by
the
recitation
to
one
self
of
emotional
poetry
was
in
every
case
less
when
recitation
was
oral
this
is
of
course
accounted
for
by
the
muscular
expression
chemistry
teaches
that
like
comes
from
the
food
and
demonstrates
that
the
force
evolved
by
the
brain
like
that
produced
by
the
muscle
comes
not
from
the
disintegration
of
its
own
tissue
but
is
the
converted
energy
of
burning
carbon
can
we
longer
doubt
says
barker
that
the
brain
too
is
a
machine
for
the
conversion
of
energy
can
we
longer
refuse
to
believe
that
even
thought
force
is
in
some
mysterious
way
correlated
to
the
other
natural
forces
and
this
even
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
it
has
never
yet
been
measured
have
we
not
a
right
to
ask
a
special
force
vital
force
should
be
needed
to
effect
the
transformation
of
physical
forces
into
those
modes
of
energy
which
are
active
in
the
manifestation
of
living
beings
while
no
peculiar
force
is
deemed
necessary
to
effect
the
transformation
of
one
mode
of
physical
force
into
any
other
mode
of
physical
force
richard
owen
says
in
the
endeavor
to
clearly
comprehend
and
explain
the
functions
of
the
combination
of
forces
called
the
physiologist
is
hindered
and
troubled
by
the
views
of
the
nature
of
those
cerebral
forces
which
the
needs
of
dogmatic
theology
have
imposed
on
mankind
religion
pure
and
undefiled
can
best
answer
how
far
it
is
righteous
or
just
to
charge
a
neighbor
with
being
unsound
in
his
principles
who
holds
the
term
to
be
a
sound
expressing
the
sum
of
living
phenomena
and
who
maintains
these
phenomena
to
be
modes
of
force
into
which
other
forms
of
force
have
passed
from
potential
to
active
states
and
reciprocally
through
the
agency
of
the
sums
or
combinations
of
forces
impressing
the
mind
with
the
ideas
signified
by
the
terms
or
we
have
now
shown
that
the
very
forces
which
give
vent
to
the
attributes
of
man
are
correlated
to
the
physical
forces
let
us
now
consider
his
attributes
as
manifested
by
his
mental
powers
there
is
no
doubt
the
difference
between
the
mental
faculties
of
the
ape
and
that
of
the
lowest
savage
who
can
not
express
any
number
higher
than
four
and
who
uses
hardly
any
abstract
terms
for
common
objects
or
for
the
affections
is
still
very
great
and
would
still
be
great
says
darwin
even
if
one
of
the
higher
apes
had
been
improved
or
civilized
as
much
as
a
dog
has
been
in
comparison
with
its
parent
form
the
wolf
or
jackal
but
when
we
examine
the
interval
of
mental
power
between
one
of
the
lowest
fishes
as
a
lamprey
or
a
lancelet
and
one
of
the
higher
apes
and
recognize
the
fact
that
this
interval
is
filled
up
by
numberless
gradations
it
does
not
become
so
difficult
to
understand
the
interval
between
an
ape
and
man
which
is
not
by
far
so
great
as
in
finding
out
what
is
peculiar
to
a
living
body
in
distinction
to
a
body
not
living
we
found
it
absurd
to
take
man
as
the
perfection
of
the
animal
scale
the
microscopic
monad
possessing
life
as
well
as
him
so
in
the
case
of
man
mental
attributes
which
have
always
been
increasing
always
perfecting
since
the
first
genuine
man
came
into
existence
it
would
be
equally
absurd
to
compare
the
intellectual
man
of
with
an
ape
to
see
what
attributes
he
possesses
which
the
ape
does
not
possess
but
if
we
go
down
in
the
scale
and
compare
the
savage
with
the
ape
the
difficulty
is
not
by
far
so
great
it
will
be
found
on
close
examination
though
that
man
and
the
higher
animals
especially
the
primates
have
many
instincts
in
common
all
says
darwin
have
the
same
senses
intuitions
and
sensations
similar
passions
affections
and
emotions
even
the
more
complex
ones
such
as
jealousy
suspicion
emulation
gratitude
and
magnanimity
they
practice
deceit
and
are
revengeful
they
are
sometimes
susceptible
to
ridicule
and
even
have
a
sense
of
humor
they
feel
wonder
and
curiosity
they
possess
the
same
faculties
of
imitation
attention
deliberation
choice
memory
imagination
the
association
of
ideas
and
reason
though
in
very
different
degrees
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
graduate
in
intellect
from
absolute
imbecility
to
high
excellence
they
are
also
liable
to
insanity
though
far
less
often
than
in
the
case
of
man
nevertheless
in
the
face
of
these
facts
many
authors
have
insisted
that
man
is
divided
by
an
inseparable
barrier
from
all
the
lower
animals
in
his
mental
faculties
it
only
shows
the
improper
or
imperfect
consideration
of
the
subject
they
have
under
discussion
it
may
be
thought
at
first
that
some
of
the
mental
attributes
mentioned
above
are
not
possessed
by
animals
i
therefore
will
briefly
consider
a
few
of
the
more
complex
ones
we
can
dismiss
the
consideration
of
such
attributes
as
happiness
terror
suspicion
courage
timidity
jealousy
shame
and
wonder
as
attributes
in
animals
is
often
observed
an
instance
mentioned
by
brehm
will
serve
to
illustrate
brehm
gives
a
curious
account
of
the
instinctive
dread
which
his
monkeys
exhibited
for
snakes
but
their
curiosity
was
so
great
that
they
could
not
desist
from
occasionally
satiating
their
horror
in
a
most
human
fashion
by
lifting
up
the
lid
of
the
box
in
which
the
snakes
were
kept
is
also
found
among
the
action
of
animals
especially
among
monkeys
which
are
well
known
to
be
ridiculous
mockers
it
is
unnecessary
to
refer
to
the
faculty
of
attention
as
it
is
common
to
almost
all
animals
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
memory
as
for
persons
or
places
one
would
hesitate
to
believe
an
animal
possesses
but
such
is
the
case
dreaming
it
will
be
admitted
gives
us
the
best
notion
of
this
power
now
as
dogs
cats
horses
and
probably
all
the
higher
animals
even
birds
have
vivid
dreams
this
is
shown
by
their
movements
and
the
sounds
uttered
we
must
admit
says
darwin
they
possess
some
power
of
imagination
there
must
be
something
special
which
causes
dogs
to
howl
in
the
night
and
especially
during
moonlight
in
that
remarkable
and
melancholy
manner
called
baying
all
dogs
do
not
do
so
and
according
to
housyeau
they
do
not
look
at
the
moon
but
at
some
fixed
point
near
the
horizon
housyeau
thinks
that
their
imaginations
are
disturbed
by
the
vague
outlines
of
the
surrounding
objects
and
conjure
up
before
them
fantastic
images
if
this
be
so
their
feelings
may
almost
be
called
superstitious
the
next
mental
faculty
is
which
stands
at
the
summit
but
still
there
are
few
persons
who
will
deny
that
animals
possess
some
power
of
reasoning
a
few
illustrations
will
be
all
that
is
necessary
to
satisfy
the
inquiring
mind
on
this
point
reugger
a
most
careful
observer
states
that
when
he
first
gave
eggs
to
his
monkey
in
paraguay
they
smashed
them
and
thus
lost
much
of
their
contents
afterward
they
gently
hit
one
end
against
some
hard
body
and
picked
off
the
bits
of
shell
with
their
fingers
after
cutting
themselves
with
any
sharp
tool
they
would
not
touch
it
again
or
would
handle
it
with
the
greatest
caution
lumps
of
sugar
were
often
given
them
wrapped
up
in
paper
and
reugger
sometimes
put
a
live
wasp
in
the
paper
so
that
in
hastily
unfolding
it
they
got
stung
after
this
had
happened
they
afterward
first
held
the
packet
to
their
ears
to
detect
any
movement
within
the
following
cases
relating
to
dogs
are
described
by
darwin
colquhoun
winged
two
wild
ducks
which
fell
on
the
farther
side
of
a
stream
his
retriever
tried
to
bring
over
both
at
once
but
could
not
succeed
she
then
though
never
before
known
to
ruffle
a
feather
deliberately
killed
one
brought
over
the
other
and
returned
for
the
dead
bird
colonel
hutchinson
relates
that
two
partridges
were
shot
at
once
one
being
killed
the
other
wounded
the
latter
ran
away
and
was
caught
by
the
retriever
who
on
her
return
came
across
the
dead
bird
she
stopped
evidently
greatly
puzzled
and
after
one
or
two
trials
finding
she
could
not
take
it
up
without
permitting
the
escape
of
the
winged
bird
she
considered
a
moment
then
deliberately
murdered
it
by
giving
it
a
severe
crunch
and
afterward
brought
away
both
together
this
was
the
only
known
instance
of
her
ever
having
wilfully
injured
any
game
here
we
have
reason
though
not
quite
perfect
for
the
retriever
might
have
brought
the
wounded
bird
first
and
then
returned
for
the
dead
one
as
in
the
case
of
the
two
wild
ducks
i
give
the
above
cases
as
resting
on
the
evidence
of
two
independent
witnesses
and
because
in
both
instances
the
retrievers
after
deliberation
broke
through
a
habit
which
was
inherited
by
them
that
of
not
killing
the
game
retrieved
and
because
they
show
how
strong
their
reasoning
faculty
must
have
been
to
overcome
a
fixed
habit
it
has
often
been
said
that
no
animal
uses
any
tool
but
this
can
be
so
easily
refuted
on
reflection
that
it
is
hardly
worth
while
considering
for
illustration
though
the
chimpanzee
in
a
state
of
nature
cracks
nuts
with
a
stone
darwin
saw
a
young
orang
put
a
stick
in
a
crevice
slip
his
hand
to
the
other
end
and
use
it
in
a
proper
manner
as
a
lever
the
baboons
in
abyssinia
descend
in
troops
from
the
mountains
to
plunder
fields
and
when
they
meet
troops
of
another
species
a
fight
ensues
they
commence
by
rolling
great
stones
at
their
enemies
as
they
often
do
when
attacked
with
the
duke
of
argyll
remarks
that
the
fashioning
of
an
implement
for
a
special
purpose
is
absolutely
peculiar
to
man
and
he
considers
this
forms
an
immeasurable
gulf
between
him
and
the
brutes
this
is
no
doubt
says
darwin
a
very
important
distinction
but
there
appears
to
me
much
truth
in
sir
lubbock
suggestion
that
when
primeval
man
first
used
for
any
purpose
he
would
have
accidentally
splintered
them
and
would
then
have
used
the
sharp
fragments
from
this
step
it
would
be
a
small
one
to
break
the
flints
on
purpose
and
not
a
very
wide
step
to
fashion
them
rudely
the
later
advance
however
may
have
taken
long
ages
if
we
may
judge
by
the
immense
interval
of
time
which
elapsed
before
the
men
of
the
neolithic
period
took
to
grinding
and
polishing
their
stone
tools
in
breaking
the
flints
as
sir
lubbock
likewise
remarks
sparks
would
have
been
emitted
and
in
grinding
them
heat
would
have
been
evolved
thus
the
two
usual
methods
of
fire
may
have
originated
the
nature
of
fire
would
have
been
known
in
many
volcanic
regions
where
lava
occasionally
flows
through
forests
it
becomes
a
difficult
task
to
determine
how
far
animals
exhibit
any
traces
of
such
high
faculties
as
there
can
be
no
doubt
if
the
mental
faculties
of
an
animal
can
be
improved
that
the
higher
complex
faculties
such
as
abstraction
and
have
developed
from
a
combination
of
the
simpler
ones
this
seems
to
be
well
illustrated
in
the
young
child
as
such
faculties
are
developed
by
imperceptible
degrees
these
high
faculties
are
very
sparingly
possessed
by
the
savage
as
buchner
has
remarked
how
little
can
the
wife
of
a
degraded
australian
savage
who
uses
very
few
abstract
words
and
can
not
count
above
four
exert
her
or
reflect
on
the
nature
of
her
own
existence
if
there
exist
a
class
of
people
so
inferior
in
their
mental
faculties
as
these
it
is
not
difficult
for
us
to
understand
how
the
educated
animal
who
possesses
memory
attention
association
and
even
some
imagination
and
reason
can
become
capable
of
abstraction
in
an
inferior
degree
even
to
the
savage
it
certainly
can
not
be
doubted
that
an
animal
possesses
mental
individuality
as
when
a
master
returns
to
a
dog
which
he
has
not
seen
for
years
and
the
dog
recognizes
him
at
once
one
of
the
chief
distinctions
between
man
and
animals
is
the
faculty
of
language
let
us
look
at
this
for
a
moment
the
essential
differences
says
whitney
which
separate
man
means
of
communication
in
kind
as
well
as
degree
from
that
of
the
other
animals
is
that
while
the
latter
is
instinctive
the
former
is
in
all
its
parts
arbitrary
and
conventional
no
man
can
become
possessed
of
any
language
without
learning
it
no
animal
that
we
know
of
has
any
expression
which
he
learns
which
is
not
the
direct
gift
of
nature
to
him
any
child
of
parents
living
in
a
foreign
country
grows
up
to
speak
the
foreign
speech
unless
carefully
guarded
from
doing
so
or
it
speaks
both
this
and
the
tongue
of
its
parent
with
equal
readiness
a
child
must
learn
to
observe
and
distinguish
before
speech
is
possible
and
every
child
begins
to
know
things
by
their
name
before
he
begins
to
call
them
if
it
were
not
for
the
added
push
says
whitney
given
by
the
desire
of
communication
the
great
and
wonderful
power
of
the
human
soul
would
never
move
in
this
particular
direction
but
when
this
leads
the
way
all
the
rest
follows
no
philologist
now
supposes
that
any
language
has
been
deliberately
invented
it
has
been
slowly
and
unconsciously
developed
by
many
steps
there
can
be
no
question
that
language
owes
its
origin
to
the
imitation
and
modification
of
various
natural
sounds
the
voices
of
other
animals
and
man
own
instinctive
cries
aided
by
signs
and
gestures
and
this
is
the
opinion
of
max
müller
and
whitney
remarks
that
spoken
language
began
we
may
say
when
a
cry
of
pain
formally
wrung
out
by
real
suffering
and
seen
to
be
understood
and
sympathized
with
was
repeated
in
imitation
no
longer
as
a
mere
instinctive
utterance
but
for
the
purpose
of
intimating
to
another
darwin
says
that
the
early
progenitor
of
man
probably
first
used
his
voice
in
producing
true
musical
cadences
that
is
in
singing
as
do
some
at
the
present
day
it
is
therefore
probable
that
the
imitation
of
musical
cries
by
articulate
sounds
may
have
given
rise
to
words
expressive
of
very
complex
emotions
the
nearest
approach
to
language
are
the
sounds
uttered
by
birds
all
that
sing
exert
their
power
instinctively
but
the
actual
song
and
even
the
call
notes
are
learned
from
their
parents
or
these
sounds
are
no
more
innate
than
language
is
in
man
as
has
been
proved
by
davies
barrington
the
first
attempt
to
sing
may
be
compared
to
the
imperfect
endeavor
in
a
child
to
babble
whitney
says
if
the
last
transition
forms
of
man
could
be
restored
we
should
find
the
transition
forms
toward
our
speech
to
be
not
at
all
a
minor
provision
of
natural
articulate
signs
but
an
inferior
system
of
conventional
signs
in
tone
gesture
and
grimace
as
between
these
three
natural
means
of
expression
it
is
simply
by
a
kind
of
process
of
natural
selection
and
survival
of
the
fittest
that
the
voice
has
gained
the
upper
hand
and
come
to
be
so
much
the
most
prominent
that
we
give
the
name
of
language
tonguiness
to
all
expression
a
single
utterance
or
two
at
first
had
to
do
the
duty
of
a
whole
clause
afterward
man
learned
to
piece
together
parts
of
speech
and
thus
arose
sentences
although
no
language
as
has
already
been
said
has
been
deliberately
invented
still
each
word
may
not
be
unfitly
compared
to
an
invention
it
has
its
own
place
mode
and
circumstances
of
devisal
its
preparation
in
the
previous
habits
of
speech
its
influence
in
determining
the
after
progress
of
speech
development
but
every
language
in
the
gross
is
an
institution
on
which
scores
or
hundreds
of
generations
and
unnumbered
thousands
of
individual
workers
have
labored
there
is
no
question
at
all
but
that
the
mental
powers
in
the
earliest
progenitors
of
man
must
have
been
more
highly
developed
than
in
the
ape
before
even
the
most
imperfect
form
of
speech
could
have
come
into
use
but
the
constant
advancement
of
this
power
would
have
reacted
on
the
mind
to
enable
it
to
carry
on
longer
trains
of
thought
a
complex
train
of
thought
says
darwin
can
no
more
be
carried
on
without
the
aid
of
words
whether
spoken
or
silent
than
a
long
calculation
without
the
use
of
figures
in
algebra
it
appears
also
that
even
an
ordinary
train
of
thought
almost
requires
or
is
greatly
facilitated
by
some
form
of
language
for
the
dumb
deaf
and
blind
girl
laura
bridgman
was
observed
to
use
her
fingers
while
dreaming
nevertheless
a
long
succession
of
vivid
ideas
may
pass
through
the
mind
without
the
aid
of
any
form
of
language
as
we
may
infer
from
the
movements
of
dogs
during
their
dreams
the
struggle
for
existence
is
going
on
in
every
language
one
after
another
will
be
swept
out
of
existence
and
the
languages
best
fitted
for
the
practical
uses
of
the
masses
of
people
will
alone
survive
max
müller
has
well
remarked
a
struggle
for
life
is
constantly
going
on
amongst
the
words
and
grammatical
forms
in
each
language
the
better
the
shorter
the
easier
forms
are
constantly
gaining
the
upper
hand
and
they
owe
their
success
to
their
own
inherent
virtue
it
must
not
be
thought
for
a
moment
that
that
which
distinguishes
a
man
from
the
lower
animals
is
the
understanding
of
articulate
sounds
for
as
every
one
knows
dogs
understand
many
words
and
sentences
and
darwin
says
at
this
stage
they
are
at
the
same
stage
of
development
as
infants
between
the
ages
of
ten
and
twelve
months
who
understand
many
words
and
sentences
but
still
can
not
utter
a
single
word
it
is
not
the
mere
articulation
which
is
our
distinguishing
character
for
parrots
and
other
birds
possess
the
power
nor
is
it
the
mere
capacity
of
connecting
definite
sounds
with
definite
ideas
for
it
is
certain
that
some
parrots
which
have
been
taught
to
speak
connect
unerringly
words
with
things
and
persons
with
events
the
lower
animals
as
has
already
been
stated
differ
from
man
solely
in
his
almost
infinitely
larger
power
of
associating
together
the
most
diversified
sounds
and
ideas
and
this
obviously
depends
on
the
high
development
of
his
mental
powers
we
now
come
to
the
consideration
of
a
very
delicate
subject
a
subject
which
is
certainly
at
best
very
unsatisfactory
to
handle
as
far
as
popular
sentiment
is
concerned
for
no
matter
how
successfully
it
may
be
handled
according
to
one
class
of
thinkers
to
another
class
of
more
orthodox
thinkers
it
would
be
entirely
at
fault
the
subject
is
moral
sense
belief
in
god
religion
conscience
and
hope
of
it
has
been
stated
by
some
writers
that
where
faith
commences
science
ends
how
erroneous
is
such
a
statement
as
this
for
as
krauth
has
said
the
great
body
of
scientific
facts
is
actually
the
object
of
knowledge
to
a
few
and
is
supposed
to
be
a
part
of
the
knowledge
of
the
many
only
because
the
many
have
faith
in
the
statements
of
the
few
though
they
can
neither
verify
them
nor
even
understand
the
processes
by
which
they
are
reached
we
believe
says
lewes
that
the
sensation
of
violet
is
produced
by
the
striking
of
the
ethereal
waves
against
the
retina
more
than
seven
hundred
billions
of
times
in
a
second
these
statements
are
accepted
by
us
who
know
that
there
are
thinkers
for
whom
they
are
irresistible
conclusions
it
is
evident
that
it
is
to
faith
that
science
owes
to
a
very
great
extent
her
progress
and
development
for
it
is
impossible
for
man
to
prove
by
experimental
demonstration
all
the
facts
of
science
and
since
a
certain
number
of
facts
have
got
to
be
accepted
before
a
new
experiment
can
be
attempted
he
has
to
accept
on
faith
that
such
and
such
a
statement
is
a
fact
because
such
and
such
a
scientist
has
claimed
to
have
demonstrated
it
we
are
not
for
the
fact
says
krauth
that
under
the
conditions
of
knowledge
we
or
in
defect
of
them
do
not
know
we
are
responsible
if
under
the
conditions
of
a
faith
we
disbelieve
let
us
look
then
at
the
belief
in
god
the
question
under
consideration
at
first
will
not
be
whether
there
exists
a
god
the
creator
and
ruler
of
the
universe
for
this
will
be
afterward
considered
but
is
there
any
evidence
that
man
was
aboriginally
endowed
with
the
ennobling
belief
in
the
existence
of
an
omnipotent
god
schweinfurth
relates
that
the
that
highly
interesting
dwarf
people
of
central
africa
have
no
word
for
god
and
therefore
it
must
be
supposed
no
idea
and
moritz
wagner
has
given
a
whole
selection
of
reports
on
the
absence
of
religious
consciousness
in
inferior
nations
the
idea
that
conscience
is
a
sort
of
permanent
inspiration
or
dwelling
of
god
in
the
soul
i
think
on
consideration
any
reasonable
man
will
not
assume
it
is
a
purely
human
faculty
says
savage
like
the
faculty
for
art
or
music
and
it
gets
its
authority
as
they
do
by
being
true
and
just
in
so
far
as
it
is
true
consciousness
is
our
own
knowledge
of
ourselves
and
of
the
relation
between
our
own
faculties
and
powers
conscience
is
our
recognition
of
the
relations
as
right
or
wrong
in
which
we
stand
to
those
about
us
god
and
our
fellows
is
to
know
with
in
relation
there
is
such
a
thing
of
course
as
a
and
a
all
the
false
conscientiousness
grows
out
of
the
fact
that
men
suppose
they
stand
in
certain
relationships
that
do
not
really
exist
thus
they
imagined
duties
that
are
not
duties
at
all
the
virtues
which
must
be
practised
by
rude
men
so
that
they
can
hold
together
in
tribes
are
of
course
important
no
tribe
could
hold
together
if
robbery
murder
treachery
were
common
in
other
words
there
must
be
honor
among
thieves
a
indian
is
well
pleased
with
himself
and
is
honored
by
others
when
he
scalps
a
man
of
another
tribe
and
a
dyak
cuts
off
the
head
of
an
unoffending
person
and
dries
it
as
a
trophy
the
murder
of
infants
has
prevailed
on
the
largest
scale
throughout
the
world
and
has
been
met
with
no
reproach
but
infanticide
especially
of
females
has
been
thought
to
be
good
for
the
tribe
or
at
least
not
injurious
suicide
during
former
times
was
not
generally
considered
as
a
crime
but
rather
from
the
courage
displayed
as
an
honorable
act
and
it
is
still
practised
by
some
and
savage
nations
without
reproach
for
it
does
not
obviously
concern
others
of
the
tribe
it
has
been
recorded
that
an
indian
thug
conscientiously
regretted
that
he
had
not
robbed
and
strangled
as
many
travelers
as
did
his
father
before
him
see
how
weak
the
conscience
of
even
more
highly
civilized
men
are
in
their
dealings
with
the
brute
creation
how
the
sportsman
delights
in
spanish
etc
how
indignant
was
the
sensitive
cowper
if
any
one
should
needlessly
set
foot
upon
a
worm
the
rights
of
the
worm
are
as
sacred
in
his
degree
as
ours
are
and
a
true
conscience
will
recognize
them
what
then
is
a
true
conscience
savage
states
in
a
few
words
it
is
one
that
knows
and
is
adjusted
to
the
realities
of
life
when
men
know
the
truth
about
god
about
themselves
body
and
mind
and
spirit
about
the
real
relations
of
equity
in
which
they
stand
to
their
in
state
and
church
and
society
and
when
they
appreciate
these
and
adjust
their
conscience
to
them
then
they
will
have
a
true
conscience
an
absolutely
true
conscience
of
course
can
not
exist
so
long
as
our
knowledge
of
the
reality
of
things
is
only
partial
it
is
evident
then
that
the
conscience
of
man
depends
on
his
education
and
environments
and
therefore
is
the
subject
of
improvement
it
becomes
then
the
duty
of
every
man
to
search
for
truth
for
his
conscience
is
not
infallible
and
by
so
doing
he
will
bring
it
to
accord
with
the
real
facts
of
god
throw
away
says
savage
prejudice
and
conceit
seek
to
make
your
conscience
like
the
magnetic
needle
the
needle
ever
and
naturally
seeking
the
unchanging
pole
as
conscience
then
is
but
a
faculty
capable
of
development
it
is
not
so
difficult
to
understand
a
race
of
people
whose
conscience
was
in
just
the
first
stages
of
development
and
finally
a
race
which
did
not
possess
this
faculty
at
all
as
in
the
inferior
nations
which
wagner
speaks
of
illustration
fig
butcher
shop
of
the
anziques
anno
from
man
place
in
nature
by
what
kind
of
conscience
and
intelligence
had
the
people
near
cape
lopez
called
the
anziques
which
du
chaillu
describes
they
had
incredible
ferocity
for
they
ate
one
another
sparing
neither
friends
nor
relations
their
were
filled
with
human
flesh
instead
of
that
of
oxen
or
sheep
for
they
ate
the
enemies
they
captured
in
battle
they
fattened
slayed
and
devoured
their
slaves
also
unless
they
thought
they
could
get
a
good
price
for
them
and
moreover
for
weariness
of
life
or
desire
for
glory
for
they
thought
it
a
great
thing
and
a
sign
of
a
generous
soul
to
despise
life
or
for
love
of
their
rulers
offered
themselves
up
for
food
there
were
indeed
many
cannibals
as
in
the
east
indies
and
brazil
and
elsewhere
but
none
such
as
these
since
the
others
only
ate
their
enemies
but
these
their
own
blood
relations
there
is
therefore
combining
the
fact
mentioned
by
wagner
with
the
fact
that
some
nations
have
no
idea
of
one
or
more
gods
not
even
a
word
to
express
it
proving
that
they
have
no
idea
i
say
there
is
therefore
no
evidence
that
man
was
aboriginally
endowed
with
any
such
belief
as
the
existence
of
an
omnipotent
god
and
in
this
assertion
almost
all
the
learned
men
concur
if
however
says
darwin
we
include
under
the
term
religion
the
belief
in
unseen
or
spiritual
agencies
the
case
is
wholly
different
for
this
belief
seems
to
be
universal
with
the
less
civilized
races
nor
is
it
difficult
to
understand
how
it
arose
the
savage
has
a
stronger
belief
in
bad
spirits
than
in
good
ones
the
same
high
mental
faculties
which
first
led
man
to
believe
in
unseen
spiritual
agencies
then
in
fetishism
polytheism
and
ultimately
in
monotheism
would
infallibly
lead
him
as
long
as
his
reasoning
powers
remained
poorly
developed
to
very
strange
superstitions
and
customs
many
of
these
are
terrible
to
think
of
such
as
the
sacrifice
of
human
beings
to
a
god
the
trial
of
innocent
persons
by
the
ordeal
of
poison
of
fire
of
witchcraft
etc
yet
it
is
well
occasionally
to
reflect
on
these
superstitions
for
they
show
us
what
an
infinite
debt
of
gratitude
we
owe
to
the
improvement
of
our
reason
to
science
and
to
our
accumulated
knowledge
as
sir
lubbock
has
well
observed
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
the
possible
dread
of
unknown
evil
hangs
like
a
thick
cloud
over
savage
life
and
embitters
every
pleasure
these
miserable
and
indirect
consequences
of
our
highest
faculties
may
be
compared
with
the
incidental
and
occasional
mistakes
of
the
instincts
of
the
lower
animals
the
belief
then
of
the
existence
of
an
omnipotent
god
came
with
the
development
of
the
mental
faculties
and
although
there
does
exist
such
a
belief
in
the
minds
of
men
whose
conscience
is
in
a
normal
condition
still
there
are
temptations
to
unbelief
and
these
have
led
men
to
atheism
i
can
not
think
of
an
atheist
unless
i
associate
in
my
thoughts
the
words
the
ruling
passion
be
it
what
it
may
the
ruling
passion
conquers
reason
still
the
atheist
has
decided
not
to
believe
in
the
existence
of
a
god
unless
he
can
see
him
and
understand
him
in
other
words
the
finite
would
comprehend
the
infinite
following
the
logical
method
of
reasoning
of
an
atheist
the
simple
fact
of
seeing
god
in
no
way
ought
to
prove
his
existence
for
when
you
say
you
see
a
person
and
that
you
have
not
the
least
doubt
about
it
i
answer
that
what
you
are
really
conscious
of
is
an
affection
of
your
retina
and
if
you
urge
that
you
can
check
your
sight
of
the
person
by
touching
him
i
would
answer
that
you
are
equally
transgressing
the
limits
of
fact
for
what
you
are
really
conscious
of
is
not
that
he
is
there
but
that
the
nerves
of
your
hand
have
undergone
a
change
all
you
hear
and
see
and
touch
and
taste
and
smell
are
mere
variations
of
your
own
condition
beyond
which
even
to
the
extent
of
a
you
can
not
go
that
anything
answering
to
your
impression
exists
outside
of
yourself
is
not
a
but
an
to
which
all
validity
would
be
denied
by
an
idealist
like
berkeley
or
by
a
skeptic
like
hume
thomas
cooper
said
i
do
not
say
there
is
no
god
but
this
i
say
i
know
not
bradlaugh
says
the
atheist
does
not
say
is
no
god
but
he
says
i
know
not
what
you
mean
by
god
i
am
without
idea
of
god
the
word
is
to
me
a
sound
conveying
no
clear
or
distinct
affirmation
i
do
not
deny
god
because
i
can
not
deny
that
of
which
i
have
no
conception
and
the
conception
of
which
by
its
affirmer
is
so
imperfect
that
he
is
unable
to
define
it
to
me
austin
holyoake
says
the
only
way
of
proving
the
fallacy
of
atheism
is
by
the
existence
of
a
god
if
it
is
logical
proof
that
is
wanted
there
is
plenty
the
following
arguments
although
not
all
meeting
my
approbation
are
still
of
interest
the
has
been
presented
in
different
forms
anselm
archbishop
of
canterbury
states
this
argument
thus
we
have
an
idea
of
an
infinitely
perfect
being
but
real
existence
is
an
element
of
infinite
perfection
therefore
an
infinitely
perfect
being
exists
otherwise
the
infinitely
perfect
as
we
conceive
it
would
lack
an
essential
element
of
perfection
descartes
states
the
argument
thus
the
idea
of
an
infinitely
perfect
being
which
we
possess
could
not
have
originated
in
a
finite
source
and
therefore
must
have
been
communicated
by
an
infinitely
perfect
being
samuel
clark
argues
that
time
and
space
are
infinite
and
necessarily
existent
but
they
are
not
substances
therefore
there
must
exist
an
eternal
and
infinite
substance
of
which
they
are
properties
cousin
maintained
that
the
idea
of
the
finite
implies
the
idea
of
the
infinite
as
inevitably
as
the
idea
of
the
me
implies
that
of
the
not
me
the
may
be
stated
thus
every
new
thing
and
every
change
in
a
previously
existing
thing
must
have
a
cause
sufficient
and
the
universe
consists
of
a
series
of
changes
therefore
the
universe
must
have
a
cause
exterior
and
anterior
to
itself
the
or
argument
from
design
or
final
causes
is
as
follows
design
or
the
adaptation
of
means
to
effect
an
end
implies
the
exercise
of
intelligence
and
free
choice
the
universe
is
full
of
traces
of
design
therefore
the
first
cause
must
have
been
a
personal
spirit
the
may
be
thus
stated
in
looking
at
the
works
of
god
there
is
says
rev
hopkins
i
suppose
evidence
enough
especially
if
interpreted
by
the
moral
consciousness
to
prove
to
a
candid
man
the
being
of
god
the
educated
man
is
a
religious
being
the
instinct
of
prayer
and
worship
the
longing
for
and
faith
in
divine
love
and
help
are
inseparable
from
human
nature
under
normal
conditions
as
known
in
history
it
is
evident
from
the
above
that
it
is
not
for
logical
reasoning
or
arguments
that
the
atheist
is
led
to
say
that
up
to
this
moment
the
world
has
remained
without
knowledge
of
a
god
it
is
from
the
folly
of
his
heart
and
as
solomon
says
that
though
you
bray
him
and
his
false
logic
in
the
mortar
of
reason
among
the
wheat
of
facts
with
the
pestle
of
argument
yet
will
not
his
folly
depart
from
him
i
fully
agree
with
hobbes
when
he
says
where
there
is
no
reason
for
our
belief
there
is
no
reason
we
should
believe
but
i
think
the
several
arguments
given
above
which
could
be
greatly
expanded
affords
sufficient
reason
for
a
perfect
belief
in
an
infinite
god
for
god
is
a
being
and
that
you
may
see
in
the
fold
of
the
flower
in
the
leaf
of
the
tree
in
the
of
darkness
in
the
rainbow
of
life
in
the
sunlight
at
noontide
in
the
darkness
of
night
in
the
wave
of
the
ocean
in
the
furrow
of
land
in
the
mountain
of
granite
in
the
atom
of
sand
gaze
where
ye
may
from
the
sky
to
the
sod
where
can
you
gaze
and
not
see
a
god
yes
the
infinite
god
must
include
all
if
he
is
not
in
the
dust
of
our
streets
in
the
bricks
of
our
house
in
the
beat
of
our
hearts
then
he
is
not
infinite
but
is
finite
having
boundaries
yes
god
power
it
was
that
set
the
nebulous
mass
into
vibration
and
caused
the
world
to
be
formed
it
was
his
force
which
first
shaped
the
atoms
into
molecules
and
then
into
more
complex
chemical
products
till
finally
organizable
protoplasm
was
reached
which
by
evolution
climbed
up
to
man
is
god
we
see
in
the
family
in
society
in
the
state
in
all
religions
up
to
the
highest
outflowings
of
christianity
is
him
we
see
in
art
literature
and
science
and
so
proclaims
evolution
god
is
the
universal
causal
law
god
is
the
source
of
all
force
and
all
matter
for
us
says
haeckel
all
nature
is
animated
penetrated
with
divine
spirit
with
law
and
with
necessity
we
know
of
no
matter
without
this
divine
spirit
the
ultimate
repulsion
constituting
the
extension
and
impenetrability
of
the
atoms
of
matter
says
samuel
brown
could
be
conceived
of
in
no
other
way
than
as
the
persistent
existence
of
the
will
of
god
himself
in
whom
we
live
and
move
and
have
our
being
and
which
if
but
for
an
instant
withdrawn
the
whole
material
universe
and
its
forces
in
all
their
vastness
glory
and
beauty
would
collapse
and
sink
in
a
moment
into
their
original
nothingness
the
advancement
of
science
instead
of
depriving
man
of
his
god
only
deprives
men
of
their
earlier
and
ruder
conceptions
of
deity
only
to
impart
a
larger
and
grander
thought
of
him
it
is
true
in
the
educational
process
some
few
minds
have
lost
sight
of
him
altogether
but
these
are
the
exceptional
and
therefore
notable
instances
with
the
great
body
of
men
the
conception
of
god
has
steadily
enlarged
with
the
progress
of
science
if
science
can
demonstrate
that
evolution
is
true
then
it
is
god
truth
and
as
such
it
is
man
religious
duty
to
accept
it
if
he
rejects
it
superstitiously
or
unreasonably
he
not
only
defrauds
himself
but
insults
the
author
of
truth
what
then
has
science
demonstrated
science
has
demonstrated
the
unity
of
the
forces
light
heat
electricity
magnetism
motion
are
all
correlated
to
one
another
and
are
all
mutually
convertible
one
into
another
heat
may
be
said
to
produce
electricity
electricity
to
produce
heat
magnetism
to
produce
electricity
electricity
magnetism
and
so
on
for
the
rest
unity
of
matter
and
for
if
matter
were
not
force
and
immediately
known
as
force
it
could
not
be
known
at
all
could
not
be
rationally
inferred
unity
of
the
life
substance
in
all
organic
and
animal
a
unity
of
power
or
faculty
a
unity
of
form
and
a
unity
of
substantial
composition
unity
of
animate
and
inanimate
nature
in
matter
form
and
force
unity
of
the
laws
of
hence
we
can
proclaim
the
unity
of
all
nature
and
of
her
laws
of
development
in
the
beautiful
words
of
giordano
bruno
a
spirit
exists
in
all
things
and
no
body
is
so
small
but
contains
a
part
of
the
divine
substance
within
itself
by
which
it
is
animated
hence
we
arrive
at
the
sublime
idea
since
we
can
in
no
other
way
account
for
the
ultimate
cause
of
anything
that
it
is
god
spirit
which
pervades
and
sustains
all
nature
by
this
admission
we
are
not
led
to
say
there
is
no
god
but
force
but
rather
there
is
no
force
but
god
god
is
infinite
and
therefore
includes
nature
but
is
nature
all
it
is
all
that
our
finite
minds
can
discover
is
true
but
can
there
not
exist
another
nature
or
world
unknown
to
us
and
if
so
since
god
is
infinite
he
will
include
that
world
also
let
us
look
to
this
and
see
what
science
can
answer
it
will
be
necessary
for
us
to
consider
before
proceeding
what
is
meant
by
the
term
soul
and
this
becomes
a
somewhat
difficult
task
as
the
term
has
been
variously
applied
to
signify
the
principle
of
life
in
an
organic
body
or
the
first
and
most
undeveloped
stages
of
individualized
spiritual
being
or
finally
all
stages
of
spiritual
individuality
incorporeal
as
well
as
corporeal
the
popular
belief
is
that
the
soul
is
not
material
but
substantial
a
divine
gift
to
the
highest
alone
of
god
creatures
but
scientific
men
such
as
carl
vogt
moleschott
büchner
schmidt
haeckel
consider
the
phenomena
of
the
soul
to
be
functions
of
the
brain
and
nerves
schmidt
says
the
soul
of
the
infant
is
in
its
manifestations
in
no
way
different
from
that
of
the
young
animal
these
are
the
functions
of
the
infantine
nervous
system
with
this
they
grow
and
are
developed
together
with
speech
the
idea
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
was
not
aboriginal
with
mankind
as
sir
lubbock
has
shown
that
the
barbarous
races
possess
no
clear
belief
of
this
kind
and
rajah
brook
at
a
missionary
meeting
in
liverpool
told
his
hearers
there
that
the
dyaks
a
people
with
whom
he
was
connected
had
no
knowledge
of
god
of
a
soul
or
of
any
future
state
darwin
remarks
that
man
may
be
excused
for
feeling
some
pride
at
having
risen
though
not
through
his
own
exertions
to
the
very
summit
of
the
organic
scale
and
the
fact
of
his
having
thus
risen
instead
of
having
been
aboriginally
placed
there
may
give
hope
for
a
still
higher
destiny
in
the
distant
future
the
belief
in
a
future
life
amongst
the
civilized
race
of
mankind
is
almost
universally
prevalent
the
proofs
of
immortality
are
various
the
desire
that
man
has
to
live
forever
and
his
horror
of
annihilation
is
one
the
good
suffer
in
this
world
and
the
wicked
triumph
this
would
indicate
the
necessity
of
future
retribution
the
infinite
perfectibility
of
the
human
mind
never
reaches
its
full
capacity
in
this
life
the
faculty
of
insight
which
sees
in
an
individual
all
its
past
history
at
a
glance
is
the
immortal
attribute
and
is
continually
on
the
increase
and
it
is
possible
that
aristotle
was
right
so
far
as
he
stated
that
the
lower
faculties
of
the
soul
such
as
sensation
imagination
feeling
memory
are
perishable
no
matter
if
this
be
so
or
not
it
is
certain
that
in
the
next
life
where
all
is
perfection
only
the
fittest
attributes
will
exist
the
others
would
have
perished
the
doctrine
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
has
been
defended
by
marhemeke
blasche
weisse
hinnichs
fecham
fichte
and
others
let
us
look
for
a
moment
at
the
visible
universe
and
see
if
it
is
not
reasonable
on
a
scientific
basis
to
admit
of
the
existence
of
another
universe
although
it
remains
unseen
to
us
one
can
not
help
but
be
struck
with
the
fact
that
energy
is
being
dissipated
in
this
visible
universe
that
the
visible
universe
is
apparently
very
wasteful
look
at
the
sun
which
pours
her
vast
store
of
energy
into
space
at
the
rate
of
miles
per
second
what
will
be
the
result
of
this
the
answer
is
simple
the
inevitable
destruction
of
the
visible
universe
yes
just
as
the
visible
universe
had
its
beginning
it
will
have
its
end
but
there
existed
a
power
before
the
visible
universe
came
into
existence
and
which
is
acting
in
the
visible
universe
as
the
ultimate
cause
of
all
phenomena
for
we
are
obliged
says
herbert
spencer
in
his
first
principles
to
regard
every
phenomenon
as
a
manifestation
of
some
power
by
which
we
are
acted
upon
though
omnipresence
is
unthinkable
yet
as
experience
discloses
no
bounds
to
the
diffusion
of
phenomena
we
are
unable
to
think
of
limits
to
the
presence
of
this
power
while
the
criticisms
of
science
teaches
us
that
this
power
is
incomprehensible
and
so
we
should
expect
for
a
finite
can
not
comprehend
an
infinite
it
is
for
this
and
other
reasons
one
is
led
to
believe
that
the
visible
universe
is
only
an
infinitesimal
part
of
that
stupendous
whole
which
is
alone
entitled
to
be
called
the
universe
as
there
existed
an
invisible
universe
before
the
visible
one
came
into
existence
we
can
conclude
that
there
still
exists
an
invisible
universe
now
and
that
this
invisible
universe
will
still
exist
when
the
present
visible
one
has
passed
away
let
us
see
what
light
our
finite
senses
can
throw
on
this
it
is
well
known
that
all
our
senses
have
only
a
certain
narrow
gauge
within
which
they
are
able
to
bring
us
into
sensible
contact
with
the
world
about
us
all
outside
this
range
we
are
unable
to
reach
for
example
we
do
not
see
all
forms
and
colors
we
do
not
hear
all
sounds
we
do
not
smell
all
odors
we
can
not
conscientiously
touch
all
substances
we
can
not
taste
all
flavors
vision
depends
on
the
wave
motion
of
light
the
length
of
a
wave
of
mean
red
light
is
about
of
an
inch
that
of
violet
of
an
inch
but
the
number
of
oscillations
of
ether
in
a
second
necessary
to
produce
the
sensation
of
red
are
all
of
which
enter
the
eye
in
one
second
for
the
sensation
of
violet
the
eye
must
receive
oscillations
in
one
second
as
light
travels
miles
in
one
second
but
when
waves
of
light
having
all
possible
lengths
act
on
the
eye
simultaneously
the
sensation
of
white
is
produced
so
as
has
been
previously
stated
without
eyes
the
world
would
be
wrapped
in
darkness
there
being
no
light
and
color
outside
of
one
eye
so
we
see
our
sense
of
sight
has
its
limits
and
we
know
how
finite
these
are
that
there
are
vibrations
of
the
ether
on
each
side
of
our
limits
of
vision
can
not
be
doubted
and
if
our
eyes
were
acute
enough
to
receive
them
we
could
have
the
sensation
of
some
color
which
must
under
present
conditions
remain
forever
blank
the
owl
and
bat
can
see
when
we
can
not
their
eyes
can
receive
oscillations
of
ether
which
pass
by
without
affecting
us
so
with
sound
which
is
a
sensation
produced
when
vibrations
of
a
certain
character
are
excited
in
the
auditory
apparatus
of
the
ear
the
longest
wave
which

has
a
length
of
about

is

is

to

or
four

the

for
instance
only

in
a

up
to
sound
travels
about
feet
per

and
the
human
voice
can
be
heard
feet
away
whilst
a
rifle
can
be
heard
feet
miles
and
very
strong
cannonading
feet
or
miles
that
there
are
vibrations
above
and
below
and
there
is
no
room
to
doubt
as
there
exist
ears
which
can
hear
them
such
as
the
hare
but
to
us
they
are
as
though
they
did
not
exist
of
all
our
senses
the
sense
of
smell
far
surpasses
that
of
the
other
sense
valentine
has
calculated
that
we
are
able
to
perceive
about
the
three
of
a
grain
of
musk
the
minute
particle
which
we
perceive
by
smell
no
chemical
reaction
can
detect
and
even
spectrum
analysis
which
can
recognize
of
a
grain
is
far
surpassed
but
this
sense
in
man
is
far
surpassed
by
the
hound
our
sense
of
taste
is
also
limited
and
as
has
been
already
stated
can
not
distinguish
all
flavors
we
can
recognize
by
taste
one
part
of
sulphuric
acid
in
parts
of
water
one
drop
of
this
on
the
tongue
would
contain
of
a
grain
of
a
grain
of
sulphuric
acid
the
length
of
time
needed
for
reaction
in
sensation
has
been
determined
by
vintschgau
and
hougschmied
and
in
a
person
whose
sense
of
taste
was
highly
developed
the
reaction
time
was
for
common
salt
second
for
sugar
second
for
acid
second
and
for
quinine
second
reviewing
then
the
above
it
is
evident
there
are
eyes
which
can
see
what
we
can
not
there
are
ears
which
can
hear
what
we
can
not
and
there
are
animals
who
can
smell
and
touch
what
we
can
not
for
anything
we
know
to
the
contrary
then
says
savage
a
refined
and
spiritualized
order
of
existences
may
be
the
inhabitants
of
another
and
unseen
world
all
about
us
as
milton
has
said
millions
of
spiritual
creatures
walk
the
earth
unseen
both
when
we
wake
and
when
we
sleep
if
there
is
a
life
very
much
different
from
and
very
much
higher
than
our
present
one
it
is
not
strange
we
are
ignorant
of
it
it
is
impossible
to
make
a
person
understand
anything
which
is
entirely
unlike
all
that
has
ever
been
seen
or
heard
for
every
idea
in
the
world
that
man
has
came
to
him
by
nature
man
can
not
conceive
of
anything
the
hint
of
which
has
not
been
received
from
his
surroundings
he
can
imagine
an
animal
with
the
hoof
of
a
bison
with
the
pouch
of
a
kangaroo
with
the
wings
of
an
eagle
with
the
beak
of
a
bird
and
with
the
tail
of
a
lion
and
yet
every
point
of
this
monster
he
borrowed
from
nature
everything
he
can
think
of
everything
he
can
dream
of
is
borrowed
from
his
surroundings
everything
so
if
an
angel
should
come
and
tell
of
another
life
it
would
mean
nothing
to
us
unless
we
could
translate
it
into
terms
of
our
own
experience
we
could
not
understand
a
that
never
was
on
land
or
sea
our
ignorance
is
not
even
then
a
probability
against
our
belief
as
has
already
been
stated
the
visible
universe
must
have
its
doom
must
end
as
it
began
by
consisting
of
a
single
mass
of
matter
but
is
there
not
a
more
primitive
state
of
matter
than
the
matter
such
as
we
know
it
yes
and
the
ether
is
that
matter
it
is
unlike
any
of
the
forms
of
matter
which
we
can
weigh
and
measure
it
is
in
some
respects
like
unto
a
fluid
and
in
some
respects
like
unto
a
solid
it
is
both
hard
and
elastic
to
an
almost
inconceivable
degree
it
fills
all
material
bodies
like
a
sea
in
which
the
atoms
of
the
material
bodies
are
as
islands
and
it
occupies
the
whole
of
what
we
call
empty
space
it
is
so
sensitive
that
a
disturbance
in
any
part
of
it
causes
a
which
is
felt
on
the
surface
of
countless
worlds
it
exerts
frictions
and
although
the
friction
is
infinitely
small
yet
as
it
has
an
almost
infinite
time
to
work
in
it
will
diminish
the
momentum
of
the
planets
and
diminish
their
ability
to
maintain
their
distance
from
the
sun
the
consequence
of
which
will
be
the
planets
will
fall
into
the
sun
and
the
solar
system
will
end
where
it
begun
according
to
sir
william
thompson
the
ultimate
atoms
of
matter
are
vortex
rings
which
professor
clifford
describes
as
being
more
closely
packed
together
finer
grained
in
ether
than
in
matter
and
he
says
whatever
may
turn
out
to
be
the
ultimate
nature
of
the
ether
and
of
molecules
we
know
that
to
some
extent
at
least
they
obey
the
same
dynamic
laws
and
that
they
act
on
one
another
in
accordance
with
these
laws
until
therefore
it
is
absolutely
disproved
it
must
remain
the
simplest
and
most
probable
assumption
that
they
are
finally
made
of
the
same
stuff
that
the
material
molecule
is
in
some
kind
of
knot
or
coagulation
of
ether
the
molecule
of
matter
such
as
we
know
then
may
have
been
and
very
probably
was
produced
by
evolution
from
the
atoms
or
vortex
rings
of
ether
according
to
the
theory
advanced
by
the
authors
of
the
work
called
the
unseen
universe
which
i
have
referred
to
the
world
of
ether
is
to
be
regarded
in
some
sort
the
obverse
complement
of
the
world
of
sensible
matter
so
that
whatever
energy
is
dissipated
in
the
one
is
by
the
same
act
accumulated
in
the
other
or
as
fiske
describes
it
it
is
like
the
negative
plate
in
photography
where
light
answers
to
shadow
and
shadow
to
light
every
act
of
consciousness
is
accompanied
by
molecular
displacements
in
the
brain
and
these
of
course
are
responded
to
by
movements
in
the
ethereal
world
views
of
this
kind
were
long
ago
entertained
by
babbage
and
they
have
since
recommended
themselves
to
other
men
of
science
and
amongst
others
to
jevon
who
says
babbage
has
pointed
out
that
if
we
had
power
to
follow
and
detect
the
manifest
effects
of
any
disturbance
each
particle
of
existing
matter
must
be
a
register
of
all
that
has
happened
the
air
itself
is
one
vast
library
on
whose
pages
are
forever
written
all
that
man
has
ever
said
or
whispered
there
in
their
mutable
but
unerring
characters
mixed
with
the
earliest
as
well
as
the
latest
sighs
of
mortality
stand
forever
recorded
vows
unredeemed
promises
unfulfilled
perpetuating
in
the
united
movements
of
each
particle
the
testimony
of
man
changeful
will
so
thought
affects
the
substance
of
the
present
visible
universe
it
produces
a
material
organ
of
memory
but
the
motions
which
accompany
thought
say
the
authors
will
also
affect
the
invisible
order
of
things
and
thus
it
follows
that
thought
conceived
to
affect
the
matter
of
another
universe
simultaneously
with
this
may
explain
a
future
state
death
then
is
for
the
individual
but
a
transfer
from
one
physical
state
of
existence
to
another
according
to
the
authors
idea
and
so
on
the
largest
scale
the
death
or
final
loss
of
energy
by
the
whole
visible
universe
has
its
counterpart
in
the
acquirement
of
a
maximum
of
life
the
correlative
unseen
world
according
to
this
theory
therefore
as
the
psychical
or
spiritual
phenomena
of
the
visible
world
only
begins
to
be
manifested
with
some
complex
aggregate
of
material
phenomena
therefore
it
is
necessary
for
the
continuance
of
mind
in
a
future
state
to
have
some
sort
of
material
vehicle
also
which
the
ether
is
supposed
to
supply
the
essential
weakness
of
such
a
theory
as
this
says
fiske
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
is
thoroughly
materialistic
in
character
we
have
reason
for
thinking
it
probable
that
ether
and
ordinary
matter
are
alike
composed
of
vortex
rings
in
a
fluid
but
whatever
be
the
fate
of
this
subtle
hypothesis
we
may
be
sure
that
no
theory
will
ever
be
entertained
in
which
analysis
of
ether
shall
require
different
symbols
from
that
of
ordinary
matter
in
our
authors
theory
therefore
the
putting
on
of
immortality
is
in
nowise
the
passage
from
a
material
to
a
spiritual
state
it
is
the
passage
of
one
kind
of
materially
conditioned
state
to
another
this
theory
dealing
with
matter
should
receive
support
by
actual
experience
as
matter
is
a
subject
of
investigation
to
accept
it
therefore
as
being
possible
without
any
positive
evidence
for
its
support
it
remains
but
a
weak
speculation
no
matter
how
ingenious
it
may
seem
to
support
an
after
life
which
is
not
materially
conditioned
i
agree
with
fiske
that
although
it
will
be
unsupported
by
any
item
of
experience
whatever
it
may
nevertheless
be
an
impregnable
assertion
if
all
were
to
agree
what
we
call
matter
is
really
force
as
it
certainly
is
for
if
matter
were
not
force
it
would
be
unthinkable
being
force
it
becomes
thinkable
this
point
i
have
touched
on
before
but
it
may
be
well
to
elaborate
on
it
a
little
just
here
the
great
lesson
that
berkeley
taught
mankind
was
that
what
we
call
material
phenomena
are
really
the
products
of
consciousness
with
some
unknown
power
not
material
existing
beyond
consciousness
we
do
very
well
to
speak
of
matter
says
fiske
in
common
parlance
but
all
that
the
word
really
means
is
a
group
of
qualities
which
have
no
existence
apart
from
our
minds
the
ablest
modern
thinkers
then
believe
that
the
only
real
things
that
exist
are
the
mind
and
god
and
that
the
universe
is
only
the
infinitely
varied
manifestation
of
god
in
the
human
conscience
it
is
evident
then
that
the
only
thing
the
materialist
concedes
real
existence
is
simply
an
orderly
phantasmagoria
and
god
and
soul
which
materialists
regard
as
mere
fictions
of
the
imagination
are
the
only
conceptions
that
answer
to
real
existence
for
instance
let
us
see
what
it
is
we
know
about
a
table
you
say
you
can
see
it
i
can
respond
that
all
you
are
conscious
of
is
that
the
nerves
of
your
eye
have
undergone
a
change
you
say
i
can
check
my
sight
of
it
by
touching
it
to
this
i
reply
all
that
you
are
really
conscious
of
is
a
sensation
and
that
something
outside
of
you
has
produced
it
but
that
all
that
is
outside
of
me
is
anything
more
than
the
manifestation
to
me
of
a
power
or
of
god
is
an
inference
and
can
not
be
proven
to
constant
manifestations
of
this
power
always
assuming
the
same
form
and
characters
which
can
be
studied
different
names
have
been
given
but
that
the
dust
of
the
street
or
beat
of
our
heart
is
anything
else
but
that
peculiar
manifestation
of
the
infinite
god
can
not
be
contradicted
savage
says
the
movement
of
electricity
along
a
is
accompanied
by
certain
molecular
changes
in
the
wire
itself
but
the
wire
is
not
electricity
neither
does
it
produce
it
thus
modern
science
has
found
it
utterly
impossible
to
explain
mind
either
as
a
part
or
a
product
of
matter
it
is
perfectly
reasonable
then
for
any
man
to
believe
in
a
purely
intellectual
and
spiritual
existence
apart
from
any
material
form
or
substance
to
comprehend
the
immortal
life
is
an
impossibility
it
transcends
any
earthly
experience
of
man
the
caterpillar
probably
knows
nothing
about
any
life
higher
than
that
of
his
toilsome
crawling
on
the
ground
but
that
is
no
proof
against
the
fact
that
we
know
he
is
to
become
a
butterfly
the
boy
knows
nothing
about
manhood
and
can
not
know
though
he
sees
men
and
their
labors
all
about
him
he
has
and
can
have
no
conception
whatever
of
what
it
means
to
be
a
man
it
transcends
all
experience
the
existence
says
fiske
of
a
single
soul
or
congeries
of
psychical
phenomena
unaccompanied
by
a
material
body
would
be
evidence
sufficient
to
demonstrate
this
hypothesis
but
in
the
nature
of
things
even
were
there
a
million
such
souls
round
about
us
we
could
not
become
aware
of
the
existence
of
one
of
them
for
we
have
no
organ
or
faculty
for
the
perception
of
soul
apart
from
the
material
structure
and
activities
in
which
it
has
been
manifested
throughout
the
whole
course
of
our
experience
even
our
own
involves
the
consciousness
of
ourselves
as
partly
material
bodies
these
considerations
show
that
our
hypothesis
is
very
different
from
the
ordinary
hypothesis
with
which
science
deals
entire
absence
of
testimony
does
not
raise
a
negative
presumption
except
in
cases
where
testimony
is
my
object
has
not
been
to
prove
the
purely
spiritual
theory
of
a
future
life
but
to
show
that
it
is
a
theory
that
intelligent
people
can
entertain
as
a
foundation
for
their
belief
in
the
hope
of
immortality
but
that
the
spiritual
life
instead
of
the
material
life
is
the
state
in
which
we
can
hope
for
immortality
i
think
there
can
be
no
question
and
such
was
the
opinion
of
paul
when
he
wrote
now
this
i
say
brethren
that
flesh
and
blood
can
not
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
neither
does
corruption
inherit
incorruption
so
when
this
corruptible
shall
have
put
on
incorruption
and
this
mortal
shall
have
put
on
immortality
then
shall
be
brought
to
pass
the
saying
that
is
written
is
swallowed
up
in
victory
o
death
where
is
thy
sting
o
grave
where
is
thy
victory
