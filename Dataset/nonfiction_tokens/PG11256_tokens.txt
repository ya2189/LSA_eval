this
book
was
originally
intended
to
be
a
companion
to
professor
tucker
in
ancient
published
in
series
of
handbooks
of
archaeology
and
art
but
the
plan
was
abandoned
for
reasons
on
which
i
need
not
dwell
and
before
the
book
was
quite
finished
i
was
called
to
other
and
more
specialised
work
as
it
stands
it
is
merely
an
attempt
to
supply
an
educational
want
at
our
schools
and
universities
we
read
the
great
writers
of
the
last
age
of
the
republic
and
learn
something
of
its
political
and
constitutional
history
but
there
is
no
book
in
our
language
which
supplies
a
picture
of
life
and
manners
of
education
morals
and
religion
in
that
intensely
interesting
period
the
society
of
the
augustan
age
which
in
many
ways
was
very
different
is
known
much
better
and
of
late
my
friend
professor
dill
fascinating
volumes
have
familiarised
us
with
the
social
life
of
two
several
periods
of
the
roman
empire
but
the
age
of
cicero
is
in
some
ways
at
least
as
important
as
any
period
of
the
empire
it
is
a
critical
moment
in
the
history
of
civilisation
and
in
the
ciceronian
correspondence
of
more
than
nine
hundred
contemporary
letters
we
have
the
richest
of
social
life
that
has
survived
from
any
period
of
classical
antiquity
apart
from
this
correspondence
and
the
other
literature
of
the
time
my
mainstay
throughout
has
been
the
der
of
marquardt
which
forms
the
last
portion
of
the
great
der
r√∂mischen
of
mommsen
and
marquardt
my
debt
is
great
also
to
professors
tyrrell
and
purser
whose
labours
have
provided
us
with
a
text
of
cicero
letters
which
we
can
use
with
confidence
the
citations
from
these
letters
have
all
been
verified
in
the
new
oxford
text
edited
by
professor
purser
one
other
name
i
must
mention
with
gratitude
i
firmly
believe
that
the
one
great
hope
for
classical
learning
and
education
lies
in
the
interest
which
the
unlearned
public
may
be
brought
to
feel
in
ancient
life
and
thought
we
have
just
lost
the
veteran
french
scholar
who
did
more
perhaps
to
create
and
maintain
such
an
interest
than
any
man
of
his
time
and
i
gladly
here
acknowledge
that
it
was
boissier
et
ses
that
in
my
younger
days
made
me
first
feel
the
reality
of
life
and
character
in
an
age
of
which
i
then
hardly
knew
anything
but
the
perplexing
political
history

the
modern
traveller
of
arriving
at

by

drives
to

hotel
through
the
uninteresting
streets
of
a
modern
town
and
thence
finds
his
way
to
the
forum
and
the
palatine
where
his
attention
is
speedily
absorbed
by
excavations
which
he
finds
it
difficult
to
understand
it
is
as
likely
as
not
that
he
may
leave
rome
without
once
finding
an
opportunity
of
surveying
the
whole
site
of
the
ancient
city
or
of
asking
and
possibly
answering
the
question
how
it
ever
came
to
be
where
it
is
while
occupied
with
museums

may
well
fail

assuming
that
the
reader
has
never
been
in

i
wish
to
transport
him
thither
in
imagination
and
with
the
help
of
the
map
by
an
entirely
different
route
but
first
let
him
take
up
the
eighth
book
of
the
and
read
afresh
the
oldest
and
most
picturesque
of
all
stories
of
arrival
at
rome
let
him
dismiss
all
handbooks
from
his
mind
and
concentrate
it
on
aeneas
and
his
ships
on
their
way
from
the
sea
to
the
site
of
the
eternal
city
virgil
showed
himself
a
true
artist
in
bringing
his
hero
up
the
tiber
which
in
his
day
was
freely
used
for
navigation
up
to
and
even
above
the
city
he
saw
that
by
the
river
alone
he
could
land
him
exactly
where
he
could
be
shown
by
his
friendly
host
almost
at
a
glance
every
essential
feature
of
the
site
every
spot
most
hallowed
by
antiquity
in
the
minds
of
his
readers
rowing
up
the
river
which
graciously
slackened
its
swift
current
aeneas
presently
caught
sight
of
the
walls
and
citadel
and
landed
just
beyond
the
point
where
the
aventine
hill
falls
steeply
almost
to
the
water
edge
here
in
historical
times
was
the
dockyard
of
rome
and
here
when
the
poet
was
a
child
cato
had
landed
with
the
spoils
of
cyprus
as
the
nearest
point
of
the
river

the
conveyance
of
that
gain
to

of
all
spots
the
best
for
a
walk
through
the
heart
of
the
ancient
city
to
the
right
was
the
aventine
rising
to
about
a
hundred
and
thirty
feet
above
the
river
and
this
was
the
first
of
the
hills
of
rome
to
be
impressed
on
the
mind
of
the
stranger
by
the
tale
of
hercules
and
cacus
which
evander
tells
his
guest
in
front
but
close
by
was
the
long
western
flank
of
the
palatine
hill
where
when
the
tale
had
been
told
and
the
rites
of
hercules
completed
aeneas
was
to
be
shown
the
cave
of
the
lupercal

again
to
the
left

hundred
yards

one
day
to

beyond
it

stream

here
found
its
way
down
from

of
the

here
and
up
the
slope
of
the
clivus

which
we
shall
presently
make
acquaintance
were
the
lowing
herds
of
evander
who
then
takes
his
guest
to
repose
for
the
night
in
his
own
dwelling
on
the
palatine
the
site
of
the
most
ancient
roman
settlement
what
evander
showed
to
his
visitor
as
we
shall
presently
see
comprised
the
whole
site
of
the
heart
and
life
of
the
city
as
it
was
to
be
all
that
lay
under
the
steep
sides
of
the
three
almost
isolated
hills
the
capitoline
palatine
and
aventine
the
poet
knew
that
he
need
not
extend
their
walk
to
the
other
hills
which
come
down
as
spurs
from
the
plain
of
the
campagna
quirinal
esquiline
caelian
densely
populated
as
those
were
in
his
own
day
they
were
not
essential
organs
of
social
and
politics
life
the
pulse
of
rome
was
to
be
felt
beating
most
strongly
in
the
space
between
them
and
the
river
where
too
the
oldest
and
most
cherished
associations
of
the
roman
people
mythical
and
historical
were
fixed
i
propose
to
take
the
reader
with
a
single
deviation
over
the
same
ground
and
to
ask
him
to
imagine
it
as
it
was
in
the
period
with
which
we
are
concerned
in
this
book
but
first
in
order
to
take
in
with
eye
and
mind
the
whole
city
and
its
position
let
us
leave
aeneas
and
crossing
to
the
right
bank
of
the
tiber
by
the
pons
aemilius
let
us
climb
to
the
fort
of
the
janiculum
an
ancient
outwork
against
attack
from
the
north
by
way
of
the
via
aurelia
and
here
enjoy
the
view
which
martial
has
made
forever
famous
hinc
septem

videre
montes
et
totam
licet
aestimare
romam
albanos
quoque
tusculosque
colles
et
quodcunque
iacet
sub
urbe
frigus
no
one
who
has
ever
stood
on
the
janiculum
and
looked
down
on
the
river
and
the
city
and
across
the
latin
plain
to
the
alban
mountain
and
the
long
line
of
hills
the
last
spurs
of
the
apennines
enclosing
the
plain
to
the
north
can
fail
to
realise
that
was
originally
an
outpost
of
the
her
kinsmen
and
confederates
against
the
powerful
and
uncanny
etruscan
race
who
dwelt
in
the
undulating
hill
country
to
the
north
the
site
was
an
outpost
because
the
three
isolated
hills
make
it
a
natural
point
of
defence
and
of
attack
towards
the
north
if
attack
were
desirable
no
such
point
of
similar
vantage
is
to
be
found
lower
down
the
river
and
if
the
city
had
been
placed
higher
up
latium
would
have
been
left
open
to
attack
the
three
hills
would
have
been
left
open
to
the
enemy
to
gain
a
firm
footing
on
latin
soil
it
was
also
as
it
turned
out
an
admirable
base
of
operations
for
carrying
on
war
in
the
long
and
narrow
peninsula
so
awkward
as
hannibal
found
to
his
cost
for
working
out
a
definite
plan
of
conquest
from
rome
astride
of
the
tiber
armies
could
operate
on
interior
lines
against
any
combination

strike
north
east
and
south
at
the
same
moment
with

behind
her
she
could
not
be
taken
in
the
rear
the
unconquerable
hannibal
did
indeed
approach
her
once
on
that
side
but
fell
away
again
like
a
wave
on
a
rocky
shore
from
the
sea
no
enemy
ever
attempted
to
reach
her
till
genseric
landed
at
ostia
in
thus
it
is
not
difficult
to
understand
how
rome
came
to
be
the
leading
city
of
latium
how
she
came
to
work
her
conquering
way
into
etruria
to
the
north
the
land
of
a
strange
people
who
at
one
time
threatened
to
dominate
the
whole
of
italy
how
she
advanced
up
the
tiber
valley
and
its
affluents
into
the
heart
of
the
apennines
and
southward
into
the
oscan
country
of
samnium
and
the
rich
plain
of
campania
a
glance
at
the
map
of
italy
will
show
us
at
once
how
apt
is
livy
remark
that
rome
was
placed
in
the
centre
of
the
peninsula
that
peninsula
looks
as
if
it
were
cleft
in
twain
by
the
tiber
or
in
other
words
the
tiber
drains
the
greater
part
of
central
italy
and
carries
the
water
down
a
valley
to
a
central
point
on
the
western
coast
with
a
volume
greater
than
that
of
any
other
river
south
of
the
po
a
city
therefore
that
commands
the
tiber
valley
and
especially
the
lower
part
of
it
is
in
a
position
of
strategic
advantage
with
regard
to
the
whole
peninsula
now
rome
as
strabo
remarked
was
the
only
city
actually
situated
on
the
bank
of
the
river
and
rome
was
not
only
on
the
river
but
from
the
earliest
times
astride
of
it
she
held
the
land
on
both
banks
from
her
own
site
to
the
tiber
mouth
at
ostia
as
we
know
from
the
fact
that
one
of
her
most
ancient
priesthoods
had
its
sacred
grove
five
miles
down
the
river
on
the
northern
bank
thus
she
had
easy
access
to
the
sea
by
the
river
or
by
land
and
an
open
way
inland
up
the
one
great
natural
entrance
from
the
sea
into
central
italy
her
position
on
the
tiber
is
much
like
that
of
hispalis
seville
on
the
baetis
or
of
arles
on
the
rhone
cities
opening
the
way
of
commerce
or
conquest
up
the
basins
of
two
great
rivers
in
spite
of
some
disadvantages
to
be
noticed
directly
there
was
no
such
favourable
position
in
italy
for
a
virile
people
apt
to
fight
and
to
conquer
capua
in
the
rich
volcanic
plain
of
campania
had
far
greater
advantages
in
the
way
of
natural
wealth
but
capua
was
too
far
south
in
a
more
enervating
climate
and
virility
was
never
one
of
her
strong
points
corfinium
in
the
heart
of
the
apennines
once
seemed
threatening
to
become
a
rival
and
was
for
a
time
the
centre
of
a
rebellious
confederation
but
this
city
was
too
near
the
east
coast
an
impossible
position
for
a
pioneer
of
italian
dominion
italy
looks
west
not
east
almost
all
her
natural
harbours
are
on
her
western
side
and
though
that
at
ostia
owing
to
the
amount
of
silt
carried
down
by
the
tiber
has
never
been
a
good
one
it
is
the
only
port
which
can
be
said
to
command
an
entrance
into
the
centre
of
the
peninsula
no
one
however
would
contend
that
the
position
of
rome
is
an
ideal
one
taken
in
and
by
itself
without
reference
to
italy
and
the
mediterranean
that
position
has
little
to
recommend
it
it
is
too
far
from
the
sea
nearly
twenty
miles
up
the
valley
of
a
river
with
an
inconveniently
rapid
current
to
be
a
great
commercial
or
industrial
centre
and
such
a
centre
rome
has
never
really
been
in
the
whole
course
of
her
history
there
are
no
great
natural
sources
of
wealth
in
the
neighbourhood
no
mines
like
those
at
laurium
in
attica
no
vast
expanse
of
country
like
that
of
carthage
the
river
too
was
liable
to
flood
as
it
still
is
and
a
familiar
ode
of
horace
tells
us
how
in
the
time
of
augustus
the
water
reached
even
to
the
heart
of
the
city
lastly
the
site
has
never
really
been
a
healthy
one
especially
during
the
months
of
july
and
august
which
are
the
most
deadly
throughout
the
basin
of
the
mediterranean
pestilences
were
common
at
rome
in
her
early
history
and
have
left
their
mark
in
the
calendar
of
her
religious
festivals
for
example
the
apolline
games
were
instituted
during
the
hannibalic
war
as
the
result
of
a
pestilence
and
fixed
for
the
unhealthy
month
of
july
foreigners
from
the
north
of
europe
have
always
been
liable
to
fever
at
rome
invaders
from
the
north
have
never
been
able
to
withstand
the
climate
for
long
in
the
middle
ages
one
german
army
after
another
melted
away
under
her
walls
and
left
her
mysteriously
victorious
there
are
some
signs
that
the
romans
themselves
had
occasional
misgivings
about
the
excellence
of
their
site
there
was
a
tradition
that
after
the
burning
of
the
city
by
the
gauls
it
was
proposed
that
the
people
should
desert
the
site
and
migrate
to
veii
the
conquered
etruscan
city
to
the
north
and
that
it
needed
all
the
eloquence
of
camillus
to
dissuade
them
it
has
given
livy
the
opportunity
of
putting
into
the
orator
mouth
a
splendid
encomium
on
the
city
and
its
site
but
no
such
story
could
well
have
found
a
place
in
roman
annals
if
the
capitol
had
been
as
deeply
set
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
as
was
the
acropolis
in
the
hearts
of
the
athenians
at
a
later
time
of
deep
depression
horace
could
fancifully
suggest
that
the
romans
should
leave
their
ancient
home
like
the
phocaeans
of
old
and
seek
a
new
one
in
the
islands
of
the
blest
some
idea
was
abroad
that
caesar
had
meant
to
transfer
the
seat
of
government
to
ilium
and
after
actium
the
same
intention
was
ascribed
to
augustus
probably
without
reason
but
the
third
ode
of
horace
third
book
seems
to
express
the
popular
rumour
and
in
an
interesting
paper
mommsen
has
stated
his
opinion
that
the
new
master
of
the
roman
world
may
really
have
thought
of
changing
the
seat
of
government
to
byzantium
the
supreme
convenience
and
beauty
of
which
were
already
beginning
to
be
appreciated
virgil
on
the
other
hand
though
he
came
from
the
foot
of
the
alps
and
did
not
love
rome
as
a
place
to
dwell
in
is
absolutely
true
to
the
great
traditions
of
the
site
for
him
rerum
facta
est
pulcherrima
roma
ii
and
in
the
the
destiny
of
rome
is
so
foretold
and
expressed
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
a
roman
reader
to
think
of
it
except
in
connexion
with
the
city
he
who
needs
to
be
convinced
of
this
has
but
to
turn
once
more
to
the
eighth
and
to
add
to
the
charming
story
of
aeneas
first
visit
to
the
seven
hills
the
splendid
picture
of
the
origin
and
growth
of
roman
dominion
engraved
on
the
shield
which
venus
gives
her
son
cicero
again
though
he
was
no
roman
by
birth
was
passionately
fond
of
rome
and
in
his
treatise
praised
with
genuine
affection
her
nativa
praesidia
he
says
of
romulus
that
he
chose
a
spot
abounding
in
springs
healthy
though
in
a
pestilent
region
for
her
hills
are
open
to
the
breezes
yet
give
shade
to
the
hollows
below
them
and
livy
in
the
passage
already
quoted
in
language
even
more
perfect
than
cicero
wrote
of
all
the
advantages
of
the
site
ending
by
describing
it
as
regionum
italiae
medium
ad
incrementum
urbis
natum
unice
locum
it
is
curious
that
all
these
panegyrics
were
written
by
men
who
were
not
natives
of
rome
virgil
came
from
mantua
livy
from
padua
cicero
from
arpinum
they
are
doubtless
genuine
though
in
some
degree
rhetorical
those
of
cicero
and
livy
can
hardly
be
called
strictly
accurate
but
taken
together
they
may
help
us
to
understand
that
fascination
of
the
site
of
rome
to
which
virgil
gave
such
inimitable
expression
on
this
site
which
once
had
been
crowded
only
when
the
roman
farmers
had
taken
refuge
within
the
walls
with
their
families
flocks
and
herds
on
the
threatening
appearance
of
an
enemy
by
the
time
of
cicero
an
enormous
population
had
gathered
many
causes
had
combined
to
bring
this
population
together
which
can
be
only
glanced
at
here
as
in
europe
and
america
at
the
present
day
so
in
all
the
mediterranean
lands
since
the
age
of
alexander
there
had
been
a
constantly
increasing
tendency
to
flock
into
the
towns
and
the
rise
of
huge
cities
such
as
antioch
alexandria
carthage
corinth
or
rhodes
with
all
the
inevitably
ensuing
social
problems
and
complications
is
one
of
the
most
marked
characteristics
of
the
last
three
centuries
in
italy
in
particular
apart
from
the
love
of
a
pleasant
social
life
free
from
manual
toil
with
various
convenient
resorts
and
amusements
the
long
series
of
wars
had
served
to
increase
the
population
in
spite
of
the
constant
loss
by
the
sword
or
pestilence
for
the
veteran
soldier
who
had
been
serving
perhaps
for
years
beyond
sea
found
it
hard
to
return
to
the
monotonous
life
of
agriculture
or
perhaps
found
his
holding
appropriated
by
some
powerful
landholder
with
whom
it
would
be
hopeless
to
contest
possession
the
wars
too
brought
a
steadily
increasing
population
of
slaves
to
the
city
many
of
whom
in
course
of
time
would
be
manumitted
would
marry
and
so
increase
the
free
population
these
are
only
a
few
of
the
many
causes
at
work
after
the
punic
wars
which
crammed
together
in
the
site
of
rome
a
population
which
in
the
latter
part
of
the
last
century
probably
reached
half
a
million
or
even
more
let
us
now
descend
from
the
janiculum
and
try
to
imagine
ourselves
in
the
rome
of
cicero
time
say
in
the
last
year
of
the
republic
as
we
walk
through
the
busy
haunts
of
this
crowded
population
we
will
not
delay
on
the
right
bank
of
the
tiber
which
had
probably
long
been
the
home
of
tradesmen
in
their
gilds
and
where
farther
down
the
rich
were
buying
land
for
gardens
and
suburban
villas
but
cross
by
the
pons
aemilius
with
the
tiber
island
on
our
left
and
the
opening
of
the
cloaca
maxima
which
drained
the
water
from
the
forum
facing
us
as
it
still
does
a
little
to
our
right
we
find
ourselves
close
to
the
forum
boarium
an
open
with
shops
tabernae
all
around
it
as
we
know
from
livy
record
of
a
fire
here
which
burnt
many
of
these
shops
and
much
valuable
merchandise
here
by
the
river
was
in
fact
the
market
in
the
modern
sense
of
the
word
the
forum
romanum
which
we
are
making
for
was
now
the
centre
of
political
and
judicial
business
and
of
social
life
we
might
go
direct
to
the
great
forum
up
the
velabrum
or
valley
once
a
marsh
right
in
front
of
us
between
the
capitol
on
the
left
and
the
palatine
on
the
right
but
as
we
look
in
the
latter
direction
we
are
attracted
by
a
long
low
erection
almost
filling
the
space
between
the
palatine
and
the
aventine
and
turning
in
that
direction
we
find
ourselves
at
the
lower
end
of
the
circus
maximus
which
as
yet
is
the
chief
place
of
amusement
of
the
roman
people
two
famous
shrines
one
at
each
end
of
it
remind
us
that
we
are
on
historic
ground
at
the
end
where
we
stand
and
where
are
the
the
for
the
competing
chariots
was
the
ara
maxima
of
hercules
which
prompted
evander
to
tell
the
tale
of
cacus
to
his
guest
at
the
other
end
was
the
subterranean
altar
of
consus
the
with
which
was
connected
another
tale
that
of
the
rape
of
the
sabines
all
the
associations
of
this
quarter
point
to
the
agricultural
character
of
the
early
romans
both
cattle
and
harvesting
have
their
appropriate
myth
but
nothing
is
visible
here
now
except
the
pretty
little
round
temple
of
a
later
date
which
is
believed
to
have
been
that
of
portunus
the
god
of
the
from
the
river
the
circus
some
six
hundred
yards
long
at
the
time
of
cicero
was
still
mainly
a
wooden
erection
in
the
form
of
a
long
parallelogram
with
shops
or
booths
sheltering
under
its
sides
we
shall
visit
it
again
when
dealing
with
the
public
entertainments
above
it
on
the
right
is
the
aventine
hill
a
densely
populated
quarter
of
the
lower
classes
crowned
with
the
famous
temple
of
diana
a
deity
specially
connected
with
the
plebs
the
clivus
patricius
led
up
to
this
temple
down
this
slope
on
the
last
day
of
his
life
gaius
gracchus
had
hurried
to
cross
the
river
and
meet
his
murderers
in
the
grove
of
furrina
of
which
the
site
has
lately
been
discovered
if
we
were
to
ascend
it
we
should
see
on
the
below
and
beyond
it
the
warehouses
and
granaries
for
storing
the
corn
for
the
which
gracchus
had
been
the
first
to
extend
and
organise
but
to
ascend
the
aventine
would
take
us
out
of
our
course
pushing
on
to
the
farther
end
of
the
circus
where
the
chariots
turned
at
the
we
may
pause
a
moment
for
in
front
of
us
is
a
gate
in
the
city
wall
the
porta
capena
by
which
most
travellers
from
the
south
using
the
via
appia
or
the
via
latina
would
enter
the
city
outside
the
wall
there
was
then
a
small
temple
of
mars
from
which
the
procession
of
the
equites
started
each
year
on
the
ides
of
quinctilis
july
on
its
way
to
the
capitol
by
the
same
route
that
we
are
about
to
take
we
shall
also
be
following
the
steps
of
cicero
on
the
happy
day
september
when
he
returned
from
exile
on
my
arrival
at
the
porta
capena
he
writes
to
atticus
the
steps
of
the
temples
were
already
crowded
from
top
to
bottom
by
the
populace
they
showed
their
congratulations
by
the
loudest
applause
and
similar
crowds
and
applause
followed
me
right
up
to
the
capitol
and
in
the
forum
and
on
the
capitol
itself
there
was
again
a
wonderful
throng
iv
we
are
now
as
the
map
will
show
at
the
angle
of
the
palatine
of
which
in
fact
we
are
making
the
circuit
a
and
here
we
turn
sharp
to
the
left
by
what
is
now
the
via
di
san
gregorio
along
a
narrow
valley
or
dip
between
the
palatine
and
caelian
hills
the
latter
the
first
we
have
met
of
the
hills
which
are
not
isolated
but
spurs
of
the
plain
of
the
campagna
the
caelian
need
not
detain
us
it
was
thickly
populated
towards
the
end
of
the
republican
period
but
was
not
a
very
fashionable
quarter
nor
one
of
the
chief
haunts
of
social
life
it
held
many
of
those
large
insulae
of
which
we
shall
hear
more
in
the
next
chapter
one
of
these
stood
so
high
that
it
interfered
with
the
view
of
the
augur
taking
the
auspices
on
the
capitol
and
was
ordered
to
be
pulled
down
going
straight
on
reach
the
angle
of
the
palatine
where
now
stands
the
arch
of
constantine
with
the
colosseum
beyond
it
and
turning
once
more
to
the
left
we
begin
to
ascend
a
gentle
slope
which
will
take
us
to
a
ridge
between
the
palatine
and
the
esquiline
another
of
the
spurs
of
the
plain
beyond
known
by
the
name
of
the
velia
and
now
we
are
approaching
the
real
heart
of
the
city
at
this
point
starts
the
sacra
via
so
called
because
it
is
the
way
to
the
most
sacred
spots
of
the
ancient
roman
city
the
temples
of
vesta
and
the
penates
and
the
regia
once
the
dwelling
of
the
rex
now
of
the
pontifex
maximus
and
it
will
lead
us
in
a
walk
of
about
eight
hundred
yards
through
the
forum
to
the
capitol
it
varied
in
breadth
and
took
by
no
means
a
straight
course
and
later
on
was
crowded
cramped
and
deflected
by
numerous
temples
and
other
buildings
but
as
yet
so
far
as
we
can
guess
it
was
fairly
free
and
open
we
follow
it
and
ascend
the
slope
till
we
come
to
a
point
known
as
the
sacra
just
where
the
arch
of
titus
now
stands
and
where
then
was
the
temple
of
jupiter
stator
and
where
also
a
shrine
of
the
public
penates
and
another
of
the
lares
of
which
no
trace
is
now
left
warn
us
that
we
are
close
on
the
penetralia
of
the
roman
state
here
a
way
to
the
left
leads
up
to
the
palatine
the
residence
then
of
many
of
the
leading
men
of
rome
cicero
being
one
of
them
but
our
attention
is
not
long
arrested
by
these
objects
it
is
soon
riveted
on
the
forum
below
and
in
front
of
us
to
which
the
sacred
way
leads
by
a
downward
slope
the
clivus
sacer
at
the
end
it
is
closed
in
by
the
capitoline
hill
with
its
double
summit
the
arx
to
the
right
and
the
great
temple
of
jupiter
juno
and
minerva
facing
towards
the
aventine
it
is
of
this
view
that
virgil
must
have
been
thinking
when
he
wrote
of
the
happy
lot
of
the
countryman
who
nec
ferrea
iura
insanumque
forum
aut
populi
tabularia
vidit
for
the
forum
is
crowded
with
bustling
human
figures
intent
on
the
business
of
politics
or
of
the
ferrea
iura
or
of
and
just
beyond
it
immediately
under
the
capitol
are
the
tabularia
of
the
roman
empire
the
whole
sacra
via
from
this
point
is
crowded
here
horace
a
generation
later
was
to
meet
his
immortal
bore
from
whom
he
only
escaped
when
the
ferrea
iura
laid
a
strong
hand
on
that
terrible
companion
down
below
at
the
entrance
to
the
forum
by
the
arch
of
fabius
fornix
fabiana
the
jostling
was
great
if
i
am
knocked
about
in
the
crowd
at
the
arch
says
cicero
to
illustrate
a
point
in
a
speech
of
this
time
i
do
not
accuse
some
one
at
the
top
of
the
via
sacra
but
the
man
who
jostles
me
the
forum
for
from
this
point
we
can
take
it
all
in
geologically
and
historically
lies
in
a
deep
hollow
to
the
original
level
of
which
excavation
has
now
at
last
reached
this
hollow
was
formed
by
a
stream
which
came
down
between
the
esquiline
and
the
quirinal
beyond
it
and
made
its
exit
towards
the
river
on
the
other
side
by
way
of
the
velabrum
as
the
city
extended
itself
amalgamating
with
another
community
on
the
quirinal
this
hollow
became
a
common
and
market
and
the
stream
was
in
due
time
drained
by
that
cloaca
which
we
saw
debouching
into
the
tiber
near
the
bridge
we
crossed
the
upper
course
of
this
stream
between
esquiline
and
quirinal
is
a
densely
populated
quarter
known
as
the
argiletum
and
higher
up
as
the
subura
where
artisans
and
shops
abounded
the
lower
part
of
its
course
where
it
has
become
an
invisible
drain
is
also
a
crowded
street
the
vicus
tuscus
leading
to
the
velabrum
and
so
to
our
at
the
forum
boarium
let
us
now
descend
the
clivus
sacer
crossing
to
the
side
of
the
slope
which
the
via
sacra
now
follows
and
reach
the
forum
by
the
fornix
fabiana
close
by
to
our
left
is
the
round
temple
of
vesta
where
the
sacred
fire
of
the
state
is
kept
ever
burning
by
its
guardians
the
vestal
virgins
and
here
too
is
their
dwelling
the
atrium
vestae
and
also
that
of
the
pontifex
maximus
regia
in
whose
potestas
they
were
these
three
buildings
then
insignificant
to
look
at
constituted
the
religious
focus
of
the
oldest
rome
a
little
farther
again
to
the
left
is
the
temple
of
castor
and
the
spring
of
juturna
lately
excavated
where
the
twins
watered
their
steeds
after
the
battle
of
the
lake
regillus
in
front
of
us
we
can
see
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
the
rostra
at
the
farther
end
of
the
forum
where
an
orator
is
perhaps
addressing
a
crowd
on
some
political
question
of
the
moment
and
giving
some
occupation
to
the
idlers
in
the
throng
and
to
the
right
of
the
rostra
is
the
comitium
or
of
the
people
with
the
curia
the
ancient
of
the
senate
in
cicero
day
the
mere
shopman
had
been
got
rid
of
from
the
forum
and
his
place
is
taken
by
the
banker
and
who
do
their
business
in
stretching
in
rows
along
both
sides
of
the
open
space
much
public
business
judicial
and
other
is
done
in
the
basilicae
roofed
halls
with
colonnades
of
which
there
are
already
five
and
a
new
one
is
arising
on
the
south
side
of
which
the
as
it
was
extended
soon
afterwards
by
julius
caesar
is
now
completely
laid
bare
but
it
is
becoming
evident
that
the
business
of
the
empire
can
not
be
much
longer
crowded
into
this
narrow
space
of
the
forum
which
is
only
about
two
hundred
yards
long
by
seventy
and
the
next
two
generations
will
see
new
fora
laid
out
larger
and
more
commodious
by
julius
and
augustus
in
the
direction
of
the
quirinal
now
making
our
way
towards
the
capitol
we
pass
the
famous
temple
or
rather
gate
of
the
janus
standing
at
the
entrance
to
the
forum
from
the
argiletum
and
the
porta
esquilina
then
the
comitium
and
curia
which
last
was
burnt
by
the
mob
in
at
the
funeral
of
clodius
and
reach
the
foot
of
the
clivus
capitolinus
just
where
was
and
is
the
ancient
underground
prison
called
tullianum
from
the
old
word
for
a
spring
the
scene
of
the
deaths
of
jugurtha
and
many
noble
captives
and
of
the
catilinarian
conspirators
on
december
here
the
via
sacra
turns
in
front
of
the
temple
of
concordia
to
ascend
the
capitol
behind
this
temple
extending
farther
under
the
slope
is
the
tabularium
already
mentioned
which
is
still
much
as
it
was
then
and
below
us
to
the
south
is
the
temple
of
saturnus
the
treasury
of
the
roman
people
thus
at
this
end
of
the
forum
under
the
capitol
are
the
whole
set
of
public
offices
facing
the
ancient
religious
buildings
around
the
vesta
temple
at
the
other
end
the
way
now
turns
again
to
the
right
and
reaches
the
depression
between
the
two
summits
of
the
capitoline
hill
leaving
the
arx
on
the
left
we
reach
by
a
long
flight
of
steps
the
greatest
of
all
roman
temples
placed
on
a
long
platform
with
solid
substructures
of
etruscan
workmanship
part
of
which
is
still
to
be
seen
in
the
garden
of
the
german
embassy
the
temple
of
jupiter
optimus
maximus
with
his
companions
juno
and
minerva
was
in
a
special
sense
the
religious
centre
of
the
state
and
its
dominion
whatever
view
he
might
take
of
the
gods
and
their
cults
every
roman
instinctively
believed
that
this
great
jupiter
above
all
other
deities
watched
over
the
welfare
of
rome
and
when
a
generation
later
virgil
placed
the
destiny
of
mythical
hero
in
the
hands
of
jupiter
every
roman
recognised
in
this
his
own
inherited
conviction
here
on
the
first
day
of
their
office
the
higher
magistrates
offered
sacrifice
in
fulfilment
of
the
vows
of
their
predecessors
and
renewed
the
same
vows
themselves
the
consul
about
to
leave
the
city
for
a
foreign
war
made
it
his
last
duty
to
sacrifice
here
and
on
his
return
he
deposited
here
his
booty
here
came
the
triumphal
procession
along
the
sacred
way
the
conquering
general
attired
and
painted
like
the
statue
of
the
god
within
the
temple
and
upon
the
knees
of
the
statue
he
placed
his
wreath
of
laurel
rendering
up
to
the
deity
what
he
had
himself
deigned
to
bestow
here
too
from
a
pedestal
on
the
platform
a
statue
of
jupiter
looked
straight
over
the
forum
the
curia
and
the
comitium
and
cicero
could
declare
from
the
rostra
and
know
that
in
so
declaring
he
was
touching
the
hearts
of
his
hearers
that
on
that
same
day
on
which
it
had
first
been
so
placed
the
machinations
of
catiline
and
his
conspirators
had
been
detected

the
temple
had
been
destroyed
by
fire
in
the
time
of
sulla
and
its
restoration
was
not
as
yet
finally
completed
at
the
time
of
our
imaginary
walk
it
faced
towards
the
river
and
the
aventine
according
to
the
rules
of
augural
lore
like
all
roman
public
buildings
of
the
republican
period
from
the
platform
on
which
it
stands
we
look
down
on
the
forum
boarium
from
which
we
started
connected
with
the
forum
by
the
velabrum
and
the
vicus
tuscus
and
more
to
the
right
below
us
is
the
campus
martius
with
access
to
the
city
by
that
porta
carmentalis
which
evander
showed
to
aeneas
this
spacious
of
roman
armies
is
already
beginning
to
be
built
upon
in
fact
the
circus
flaminius
has
been
there
for
more
than
a
century
and
a
half
and
now
the
new
theatre
of
pompeius
the
first
stone
theatre
in
rome
rises
beyond
it
towards
the
vatican
hill
but
there
is
ample
space
left
for
it
is
nearly
a
mile
from
the
capitol
to
that
curve
of
the
tiber
above
which
the
church
of
peter
now
stands
and
on
this
large
expanse
at
the
present
day
the
greater
part
of
a
population
of
nearly
half
a
million
is
housed
i
do
not
propose
to
take
the
reader
farther
we
have
been
through
the
heart
of
the
city
as
it
was
at
the
close
of
the
republican
period
and
from
the
platform
of
the
great
temple
we
can
see
all
else
that
we
need
to
keep
in
mind
in
these
chapters
chapter
ii
the
lower
population
plebs
urbana
the
walk
we
have
been
taking
has
led
us
only
through
the
heart
of
the
city
in
which
were
the
public
buildings
temples
basilicas
porticos
of
which
we
hear
so
much
in
latin
literature
it
was
on
the
hills
which
are
spurs
of
the
plain
beyond
and
which
look
down
over
the
forum
and
the
campus
martius
the
caelian
esquiline
and
quirinal
with
the
hollows
lying
between
them
and
also
on
the
aventine
by
the
river
that
the
mass
of
the
population
lived
the
most
ancient
fortification
of
completed
rome
the
servian
wall
and
enclosed
a
singularly
large
space
larger
we
are
told
than
the
walls
of
any
old
city
in
italy
it
is
likely
that
a
good
part
of
this
space
was
long
unoccupied
by
houses
and
served
to
shelter
the
cattle
of
the
farmers
living
outside
when
an
enemy
was
threatening
attack
but
in
cicero
time
as
all
this
space
was
covered
with
dwellings
and
as
the
centre
of
the
city
came
to
be
occupied
with
public
buildings
erected
on
sites
often
bought
from
private
owners
the
houses
were
gradually
pushed
out
along
the
roads
beyond
the
walls
exactly
the
same
process
has
been
going
on
for
centuries
in
the
university
city
of
oxford
where
the
erection
of
colleges
gradually
absorbed
the
best
sites
within
the
old
walls
so
that
many
of
the
are
now
quite
two
miles
from
the
centre
of
the
city
the
fact
is
attested
for
rome
by
the
famous
municipal
law
of
julius
caesar
which
directs
that
for
a
mile
outside
the
gates
every
resident
is
to
look
after
the
repair
of
the
road
in
front
of
his
own
house
as
a
general
rule
the
heights
in
rome
were
occupied
by
the
better
class
of
residents
and
the
hollows
by
the
lower
stratum
of
population
this
was
not
indeed
entirely
so
for
poor
people
no
doubt
lived
on
the
aventine
the
caelian
and
parts
of
the
esquiline
but
the
palatine
was
certainly
an
aristocratic
quarter
the
carinae
the
height
looking
down
on
the
hollow
where
the
colosseum
now
stands
had
many
good
houses
those
of
pompeius
and
of
quintus
cicero
and
we
know
of
one
man
of
great
wealth
atticus
who
lived
on
the
quirinal
it
was
in
the
narrow
hollows
leading
down
from
these
heights
to
the
forum
such
as
the
subura
between
esquiline
and
quirinal
and
the
argiletum
farther
down
near
the
forum
that
we
meet
in
literature
what
we
may
call
the
working
classes
the
argiletum
for
example
was
famous
both
for
its
booksellers
and
its
shoemakers
and
the
subura
is
the
typical
street
of
tradesmen
and
no
doubt
the
big
in
which
the
lower
classes
dwelt
were
to
be
found
in
all
parts
of
rome
except
the
strictly
aristocratic
districts
like
the
palatine
the
whole
free
population
may
roughly
be
divided
into
three
classes
of
which
the
first
two
constituting
together
the
social
aristocracy
were
a
mere
handful
in
number
compared
with
the
third
at
the
top
of
the
social
order
was
the
governing
class
or
then
came
the
comprising
all
the
men
of
business
bankers
and
merchants
or
contractors
for
the
raising
of
taxes
and
many
other
purposes
of
these
two
upper
classes
and
their
social
life
we
shall
see
something
in
later
chapters
at
present
we
are
concerned
with
the
masses
at
least
in
number
and
the
social
problems
which
their
existence
presented
or
ought
to
have
presented
to
an
intelligent
roman
statesman
of
cicero
time
unfortunately
just
as
we
know
but
little
of
the
populous
districts
of
rome
so
too
we
know
little
of
its
industrial
population
the
upper
classes
including
all
writers
of
memoirs
and
history
were
not
interested
in
them
there
was
no
philanthropist
no
devoted
inquirer
like
charles
booth
to
investigate
their
condition
or
try
to
ameliorate
it
the
statesman
if
he
troubled
himself
about
them
at
all
looked
on
them
as
a
dangerous
element
of
society
only
to
be
considered
as
human
beings
at
election
time
at
all
other
times
merely
as
animals
that
had
to
be
fed
in
order
to
keep
them
from
becoming
an
active
peril
the
philosopher
even
the
stoic
whose
creed
was
by
far
the
most
ennobling
in
that
age
seems
to
have
left
the
dregs
of
the
people
quite
out
of
account
though
his
philosophy
nominally
took
the
whole
of
mankind
into
its
cognisance
it
believed
the
masses
to
be
degraded
and
vicious
and
made
no
effort
to
redeem
them
the
stoic
might
profess
the
tenderest
feeling
towards
all
mankind
as
cicero
did
when
moved
by
some
recent
reading
of
stoic
doctrine
he
might
say
that
men
were
born
for
the
sake
of
men
that
each
should
help
the
other
or
that
nature
has
inclined
us
to
love
men
for
this
is
the
foundation
of
all
law
but
when
in
actual
social
or
political
contact
with
the
same
masses
cicero
could
only
speak
of
them
with
contempt
or
disgust
it
is
a
melancholy
and
significant
fact
that
what
little
we
do
know
from
literature
about
this
class
is
derived
from
the
part
they
occasionally
played
in
riots
and
revolutionary
disorders
it
is
fortunately
quite
impossible
that
the
historian
of
the
future
should
take
account
of
the
life
of
the
educated
and
wealthy
only
but
in
the
history
of
the
past
and
especially
of
the
last
three
centuries
we
have
to
contend
with
this
difficulty
and
can
only
now
and
then
find
thrown
upon
the
great
mass
of
mankind
the
crime
the
crowding
the
occasional
suffering
from
starvation
and
pestilence
in
the
unfashionable
quarters
of
such
a
city
as
rome
these
things
are
hidden
from
us
and
rarely
even
suggested
by
the
histories
we
commonly
read
the
three
questions
to
which
i
wish
to
make
some
answer
in
this
chapter
are
how
was
this
population
housed
how
was
it
supplied
with
food
and
clothing
and
how
was
it
employed
it
was
of
course
impossible
in
a
city
like
rome
that
each
man
married
or
unmarried
should
have
his
own
house
this
is
not
so
even
in
the
great
majority
of
modern
industrial
towns
though
we
in
england
are
accustomed
to
see
our
comparatively
artisans
dwelling
in
cottages
spreading
out
into
the
country
at
rome
only
the
wealthy
families
lived
in
separate
houses
about
which
we
shall
have
something
to
say
in
another
chapter
the
mass
of
the
population
lived
or
rather
ate
and
slept
for
southern
climates
favour
an
life
in
huge
called
islands
because
they
were
detached
from
other
buildings
and
had
streets
on
all
sides
of
them
as
islands
have
water
these
were
often
three
or
four
stories
high
the
was
often
occupied
by
shops
kept
perhaps
by
some
of
the
lodgers
and
the
upper
floors
by
single
rooms
with
small
windows
looking
out
on
the
street
or
into
an
interior
court
the
common
name
for
such
a
room
was
or
a
word
which
seems
to
be
taken
over
from
the
of
private
houses
an
on
the
first
floor
where
there
was
one
once
indeed
we
hear
of
an
in
an
insula
which
was
perhaps
the
equivalent
of
a
modern
flat
it
was
inhabited
by
a
young
bachelor
of
good
birth
caelius
rufus
the
friend
of
cicero
and
in
this
case
the
insula
was
probably
one
of
a
superior
kind
the
common
must
have
been
simply
a
the
crowded
inhabitants
using
their
rooms
only
for
eating
and
sleeping
while
for
the
most
part
they
prowled
about
either
idling
or
getting
such
employment
as
they
could
legitimate
or
otherwise
in
such
a
life
there
could
of
course
have
been
no
idea
of
home
or
of
that
simple
and
sacred
family
life
which
had
once
been
the
ethical
basis
of
roman
society
when
we
read
cicero
thrilling
language
about
the
loss
of
his
own
house
after
his
return
from
exile
and
then
turn
to
think
of
the
homeless
crowds
in
the
of
rome
we
can
begin
to
feel
the
contrast
between
the
wealth
and
poverty
of
that
day
what
is
more
strictly
protected
he
says
by
all
religious
feeling
than
the
house
of
each
individual
citizen
here
is
his
altar
his
hearth
here
are
his
di
penates
here
he
keeps
all
the
objects
of
his
worship
and
performs
all
his
religious
rites
his
house
is
a
refuge
so
solemnly
protected
that
no
one
can
be
torn
from
it
by
force
the
cicero
is
here
as
so
often
dreaming
dreams
the
each
individual
citizen
of
whom
he
speaks
is
the
citizen
of
his
own
acquaintance
not
the
vast
majority
with
whom
his
mind
does
not
trouble
itself
these
insulae
were
usually
built
or
owned
by
men
of
capital
and
were
often
called
by
the
names
of
their
owners
cicero
in
one
of
his
letters
incidentally
mentions
that
he
had
money
thus
invested
and
we
are
disposed
to
wonder
whether
his
insulae
were
kept
in
good
repair
for
in
another
letter
he
happens
to
tell
his
man
of
business
that
shops
tabernae
belonging
to
him
were
tumbling
down
and
unoccupied
it
is
more
than
likely
that
many
of
the
insulae
were
badly
built
by
speculators
and
liable
to
collapse
the
following
passage
from
plutarch
of
suggests
this
though
if
plutarch
is
right
crassus
did
not
build
himself
but
let
or
sold
his
sites
and
builders
to
others
observing
in
sulla
time
the
accidents
that
were
familiar
at
rome
conflagrations
and
tumbling
down
of
houses
owing
to
their
weight
and
crowded
state
he
bought
slaves
who
were
architects
and
builders
having
collected
these
to
the
number
of
more
than
five
hundred
it
was
his
practice
to
buy
up
houses
on
fire
and
houses
next
to
those
on
fire
for
the
owners
frightened
and
anxious
would
sell
them
cheap
and
thus
the
greater
part
of
rome
fell
into
the
hands
of
crassus
but
though
he
had
so
many
artisans
he
built
no
house
except
his
own
for
he
used
to
say
that
those
who
were
fond
of
building
ruined
themselves
without
the
help
of
an
enemy
the
fall
of
houses
and
their
destruction
in
the
frequent
fires
became
familiar
features
of
life
at
rome
about
this
time
and
are
alluded
to
by
catullus
in
his
poem
and
later
on
by
strabo
in
his
description
of
rome
it
must
indeed
have
often
happened
that
whole
families
were
utterly
homeless
and
in
those
days
there
were
no
insurance
offices
no
benefit
societies
no
philanthropic
institutions
to
rescue
the
suffering
from
undeserved
misery
as
we
shall
see
later
on
they
were
constantly
in
debt
and
in
the
hands
of
the
and
against
his
extortions
their
judicial
remedies
were
most
precarious
but
all
this
is
hidden
from
our
eyes
only
now
and
again
we
can
hear
a
faint
echo
of
their
inarticulate
cry
for
help
the
needs
of
these
poorer
classes
in
respect
of
food
and
drink
were
very
small
it
was
only
the
vast
number
of
them
that
made
the
supply
difficult
the
italians
like
the
greeks
were
then
as
now
almost
entirely
vegetarians
cattle
and
sheep
were
used
for
the
production
of
cheese
leather
and
wool
or
for
sacrifices
to
the
gods
the
only
animal
commonly
eaten
until
luxury
came
in
with
increasing
wealth
was
the
pig
and
grain
and
vegetables
were
the
staple
food
of
the
poor
man
both
in
town
and
country
among
the
lesser
poems
ascribed
to
virgil
there
is
one
the
which
gives
a
charming
picture
of
the
of
the
small
cultivator
in
the
country
he
rises
very
early
gropes
his
way
to
the
hearth
and
stirs
the
embers
into
flame
then
takes
from
his
a
supply
of
grain
for
three
days
and
proceeds
to
grind
it
in
a
knead
it
with
water
shape
it
into
round
cakes
divided
into
four
parts
like
a
bun
and
with
the
help
of
his
one
female
slave
to
bake
these
in
the
embers
he
has
no
sides
of
smoked
bacon
says
the
poet
hanging
from
his
roof
but
only
a
cheese
so
to
add
to
his
meal
he
goes
into
his
garden
and
gathers
thence
a
number
of
various
herbs
and
vegetables
which
he
then
makes
into
the
or
which
gives
the
name
to
the
poem
this
bit
of
delicate
which
is
as
good
in
its
way
as
anything
in
crabbe
homely
poems
has
indeed
nothing
to
tell
us
of
life
in
an
insula
at
rome
but
it
may
serve
to
show
what
was
the
ordinary
food
of
the
italian
of
that
day
the
absence
of
the
sides
of
bacon
durati
sale
terga
suis
line
is
interesting
no
doubt
the
roman
took
meat
when
he
could
get
it
but
to
have
to
subsist
on
it
even
for
a
short
time
was
painful
to
him
and
more
than
once
caesar
remarks
on
the
endurance
of
his
soldiers
in
submitting
to
eat
meat
when
corn
was
not
to
be
had
the
corn
which
was
at
this
time
the
staple
food
of
the
romans
of
the
city
was
wheat
and
wheat
of
a
good
kind
in
primitive
times
it
had
been
an
inferior
species
called
which
survived
in
cicero
day
only
in
the
form
of
cakes
offered
to
the
gods
in
religious
ceremonies
the
wheat
was
not
brought
from
italy
or
even
from
latium
what
each
italian
community
then
grew
was
not
more
than
supplied
its
own
inhabitants
and
the
same
was
the
case
with
the
country
villas
of
the
rich
and
the
huge
worked
by
slaves
by
far
the
greater
part
of
italy
is
mountainous
and
not
well
suited
to
the
production
of
corn
on
a
large
scale
and
for
long
past
other
causes
had
combined
to
limit
what
production
there
was
transport
too
whether
by
road
or
river
was
full
of
difficulty
while
on
the
other
hand
a
glance
at
the
map
will
show
that
the
voyage
for
between
rome
and
sicily
sardinia
or
the
province
of
africa
the
former
dominion
of
carthage
was
both
short
and
easy
far
shorter
and
easier
than
the
voyage
from
cisalpine
gaul
or
even
from
apulia
where
the
peninsula
was
richest
in
good
so
we
are
not
surprised
to
find
that
according
to
tradition
which
is
fully
borne
out
by
more
certain
evidence
corn
had
been
brought
to
rome
from
sicily
as
early
as
to
relieve
a
famine
or
that
since
sicily
sardinia
and
africa
had
become
roman
provinces
their
vast
productive
capacity
was
utilised
to
feed
the
great
city
nor
indeed
need
we
be
surprised
to
find
that
the
state
has
taken
over
the
task
of
feeding
the
roman
population
and
of
feeding
it
cheaply
if
only
we
are
accustomed
to
think
not
merely
to
read
about
life
in
the
city
at
this
period
nothing
is
more
difficult
for
the
ordinary
reader
of
ancient
history
than
to
realise
the
difficulty
of
feeding
large
masses
of
human
beings
whether
crowded
in
towns
or
soldiers
in
the
field
our
means
of
transport
are
now
so
easily
and
rapidly
set
in
action
and
maintained
that
it
would
need
a
war
with
some
great
to
convince
us
that
london
or
glasgow
might
under
certain
untoward
circumstances
be
starved
and
as
our
attention
has
never
been
drawn
to
the
details
of
we
do
not
readily
see
why
there
should
have
been
any
such
difficulty
at
rome
as
to
call
for
the
intervention
of
the
state
perhaps
the
best
way
to
realise
the
problem
is
to
reflect
that
every
adult
inhabitant
needed
about
four
and
a
half
pecks
of
corn
per
month
or
some
three
pounds
a
day
so
that
if
the
population
of
rome
be
taken
at
half
a
million
in
cicero
time
a
million
and
a
half
pounds
would
be
demanded
as
the
daily
consumption
of
the
people
i
have
already
said
that
in
the
last
three
centuries
there
was
a
universal
tendency
to
leave
the
country
for
the
towns
and
we
now
know
that
many
other
cities
besides
rome
not
only
felt
the
same
difficulty
but
actually
used
the
same
remedy
state
importation
of
cheap
corn
even
comparatively
small
cities
like
dyrrhachium
and
apollonia
in
epirus
as
caesar
tells
us
while
narrating
his
own
difficulty
in
feeding
his
army
there
used
for
the
most
part
imported
corn
and
we
must
remember
that
while
some
of
the
greatest
cities
on
the
mediterranean
such
as
alexandria
and
antioch
were
within
easy
reach
of
vast
this
was
not
the
case
with
rome
either
she
must
organise
her
on
a
secure
basis
or
get
rid
of
her
swarms
of
poor
inhabitants
the
latter
alternative
might
have
been
possible
if
she
had
been
willing
to
let
them
starve
but
probably
in
no
other
way
to
attempt
to
put
them
out
upon
the
land
again
was
hopeless
they
knew
nothing
of
agriculture
and
were
unused
to
manual
labour
which
they
despised
thus
ever
since
rome
had
been
a
city
of
any
size
it
had
been
the
duty
of
the
plebeian
aediles
to
see
that
it
was
adequately
supplied
with
corn
and
in
times
of
dearth
or
other
difficulty
these
magistrates
had
to
take
special
measures
to
procure
it
with
a
population
steadily
rising
since
the
war
with
hannibal
and
after
the
acquisition
of
two
provinces
to
which
africa
was
added
in
it
was
natural
that
they
should
turn
their
attention
more
closely
to
the
resources
of
these
and
now
the
provincial
governors
had
to
see
that
the
necessary
amount
of
corn
was
furnished
from
these
provinces
at
a
fixed
price
and
that
a
low
one
in
gaius
gracchus
took
the
matter
in
hand
and
made
it
a
part
of
his
whole
political
scheme
the
plebs
urbana
had
become
a
very
awkward
element
in
the
calculations
of
a
statesman
and
to
have
it
in
a
state
of
starvation
or
even
fearing
such
a
state
was
dangerous
in
the
extreme
as
every
roman
statesman
had
to
learn
in
the
course
of
the
two
following
centuries
the
aediles
we
may
guess
were
quite
unequal
to
the
work
demanded
of
them
and
at
times
victorious
provincial
governors
would
bring
home
great
quantities
of
corn
and
give
it
away
gratis
for
their
private
purposes
with
bad
results
both
economic
and
moral
gracchus
saw
that
the
work
of
supply
needed
thorough
organisation
in
regard
to
production
transport
warehousing
and
finance
and
set
about
it
with
a
delight
in
hard
work
such
as
no
roman
statesman
had
shown
before
believing
that
if
the
people
could
be
fed
cheaply
and
regularly
they
would
cease
to
be
a
troublesome
neighbour
we
do
not
know
the
details
of
his
scheme
of
organisation
except
in
one
particular
the
price
at
which
the
corn
was
to
be
sold
per
peck
this
was
to
be
six
and
or
rather
less
than
half
the
normal
of
the
day
so
far
as
it
can
be
made
out
whether
he
believed
that
the
cost
of
production
could
be
brought
down
to
this
level
by
regularity
of
demand
and
transport
we
can
not
tell
it
seems
at
any
rate
probable
that
he
had
gone
carefully
into
the
financial
aspect
of
the
business
but
there
can
hardly
be
a
doubt
that
he
miscalculated
and
that
the
result
of
the
law
by
which
he
sought
to
effect
his
object
was
a
yearly
loss
to
the
treasury
so
that
after
his
time
and
until
his
law
was
repealed
by
sulla
the
people
were
really
being
fed
largely
at
the
expense
of
the
state
and
thus
lapsing
into
a
state
of
semipauperism
with
bad
ethical
consequences
one
of
these
consequences
was
that
inconsiderate
statesmen
would
only
too
readily
seize
the
chance
of
reducing
the
price
of
the
corn
still
lower
as
was
done
by
saturninus
in
for
political
purposes
to
prevent
this
sulla
abolished
the
gracchan
system
but
it
was
renewed
in
and
in
the
demagogue
clodius
made
the
distribution
of
corn
gratuitous
in
caesar
found
that
no
less
than
persons
were
receiving
corn
from
the
state
for
nothing
by
a
bill
of
which
we
still
possess
a
part
he
reduced
the
number
to
and
by
a
rigid
system
of
rules
of
which
we
know
something
contrived
to
ensure
that
it
should
be
kept
at
that
point
with
the
policy
of
augustus
and
his
successors
in
regard
to
the
i
am
not
here
concerned
but
it
is
necessary
to
observe
that
with
the
establishment
of
the
empire
the
plebs
urbana
ceased
to
be
of
any
importance
in
politics
and
could
be
treated
as
a
petted
population
from
whom
no
harm
was
to
be
expected
if
they
were
kept
comfortable
and
amused
augustus
seems
to
have
found
himself
compelled
to
take
up
this
attitude
towards
them
and
he
was
able
to
do
so
because
he
had
thoroughly
reorganised
the
public
finance
and
knew
what
he
could
afford
for
the
purpose
but
in
time
of
cicero
the
people
were
still
powerful
legislation
and
elections
and
the
public
finance
was
disorganised
and
in
confusion
and
the
result
was
that
the
was
mixed
up
with
politics
and
handled
by
reckless
politicians
in
a
way
that
was
as
ruinous
to
the
treasury
as
it
was
to
the
moral
welfare
of
the
city
the
whole
story
from
gracchus
onwards
is
a
wholesome
lesson
on
the
mischief
of
granting
outdoor
relief
in
any
form
whatever
without
instituting
the
means
of
inquiry
into
each
individual
case
gracchus
intentions
were
doubtless
honest
and
good
but
ubi
semel
recto
deerratum
est
in
praeceps
pervenitur
the
drink
of
the
roman
was
water
but
he
mixed
it
with
wine
whenever
he
had
the
chance
fortunately
for
him
he
had
no
other
intoxicating
drink
we
hear
neither
of
beer
nor
spirits
in
roman
literature
italy
was
well
suited
to
the
cultivation
of
the
vine
and
though
down
to
the
last
century
of
the
republic
the
choice
kinds
of
wine
came
chiefly
from
greece
yet
we
have
unquestionable
proof
that
wine
was
made
in
the
neighbourhood
of
rome
at
the
very
outset
of
roman
history
in
the
oldest
religious
calendar
we
find
two
festivals
called
vinalia
one
in
april
and
the
other
in
august
what
exactly
was
the
relation
of
each
of
them
to
the
operations
of
viticulture
is
by
no
means
clear
but
we
know
that
these
operations
were
under
the
protection
of
jupiter
and
that
his
priest
the
flamen
dialis
offered
to
him
the
of
the
vintage
the
production
of
rough
wine
must
indeed
have
been
large
for
we
happen
to
know
that
it
was
at
times
remarkably
cheap
in
in
many
ways
a
wonderfully
productive
year
wine
was
sold
at
an
the
which
is
nearly
three
quarts
under
the
early
empire
columella
iii
reckoned
the
amphora
nearly
gallons
at
sesterces
about
eightpence
that
the
common
citizen
did
expect
to
be
able
to
qualify
his
water
with
wine
seems
proved
by
a
story
told
by
suetonius
that
when
the
people
complained
to
augustus
that
the
price
of
wine
was
too
high
he
curtly
and
wisely
answered
that
agrippa
had
but
lately
given
them
an
excellent
it
looks
as
though
they
were
claiming
to
have
wine
as
well
as
grain
supplied
them
by
the
government
at
a
low
price
or
gratuitously
but
this
was
too
much
even
for
augustus
for
his
water
the
roman
it
need
hardly
be
said
paid
nothing
on
the
whole
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
speaking
he
was
fairly
well
supplied
with
it
but
in
this
as
in
so
many
other
matters
of
urban
administration
it
was
under
augustus
that
an
abundant
supply
was
first
procured
and
maintained
by
an
excellent
system
of
management
frontinus
to
whose
work
we
owe
almost
all
that
we
know
about
the
roman
tells
us
that
for
four
hundred
and
years
after
the
foundation
of
the
city
the
romans
contented
themselves
with
such
water
as
they
could
get
from
the
tiber
from
wells
and
from
natural
springs
and
adds
that
some
of
the
springs
were
in
his
day
still
held
in
honour
on
account
of
their
qualities
cicero
describes
rome
in
his
idealising
way
as
locum
fontibus
abundantem
and
springs
are
known
to
have
existed
but
as
early
it
was
found
necessary
to
seek
elsewhere
for
a
purer
and
more
regular
supply
more
than
six
miles
from
rome
on
the
via
collatina
springs
were
found
and
utilised
for
this
purpose
which
have
lately
been
at
the
bottom
of
some
stone
quarries
and
hence
the
water
was
brought
by
underground
pipes
along
the
line
of
the
same
road
to
the
city
and
through
it
to
the
foot
of
the
aventine
the
plebeian
quarter
this
was
the
aqua
appia
named
after
the
famous
censor
appius
claudius
caecus
whom
mommsen
has
shown
to
have
been
a
friend
of
the
people
forty
years
later
another
censor
manius
curius
dentatus
brought
a
second
supply
also
by
an
underground
channel
from
the
river
anio
near
tibur
tivoli
the
water
of
which
never
of
the
first
quality
was
used
for
the
irrigation
of
gardens
and
the
flushing
of
drains
in
it
was
found
that
these
two
old
aqueducts
were
out
of
repair
and
insufficient
and
this
time
a
praetor
marcius
rex
probably
through
the
influence
of
a
family
clique
was
commissioned
to
set
them
in
order
and
to
procure
a
fresh
supply
he
went
much
farther
than
his
predecessors
had
gone
for
springs
and
drew
a
volume
of
excellent
and
clear
cold
water
from
the
sabine
hills
beyond
tibur
miles
from
the
city
which
had
the
highest
reputation
at
all
times
and
for
the
last
six
miles
of
its
course
it
was
carried
above
ground
upon
a
series
of
arches
one
other
aqueduct
was
added
in
the
aqua
tepula
so
called
because
its
water
was
unusually
warm
and
the
whole
amount
of
water
entering
rome
in
the
last
century
of
the
republic
is
estimated
at
more
than
cubic
metres
per
diem
which
would
amply
suffice
for
a
population
of
half
a
million
at
the
present
day
rome
with
a
population
of
receives
from
all
sources
only
baths
both
public
and
private
were
already
beginning
to
come
into
fashion
of
these
more
will
be
said
later
on
the
water
for
drinking
was
collected
in
large
or
reservoirs
and
thence
distributed
into
public
fountains
of
which
one
still
survives
the
trofei
di
mario
in
the
piazza
vittorio
emmanuele
on
the
esquiline
when
the
supply
came
to
be
large
enough
the
owners
of
insulae
and
domus
were
allowed
to
have
water
laid
on
by
private
pipes
as
we
have
it
in
modern
towns
but
it
is
not
certain
when
this
permission
was
first
given
but
we
must
return
to
the
individual
roman
of
the
masses
whom
we
have
now
seen
well
supplied
with
the
necessaries
of
life
and
try
to
form
some
idea
of
the
way
in
which
he
was
employed
or
earned
a
living
this
is
by
no
means
an
easy
task
for
these
small
people
as
we
have
already
seen
did
not
interest
their
educated
and
for
this
reason
we
hear
hardly
anything
of
them
in
the
literature
of
the
time
not
only
a
want
of
philanthropic
feeling
in
their
betters
but
an
inherited
contempt
for
all
small
industry
and
retail
dealing
has
helped
to
hide
them
away
from
us
an
contempt
because
it
is
in
fact
a
survival
from
an
older
social
system
when
the
citizen
did
not
need
the
work
of
the
artisan
and
small
retailer
but
supplied
all
his
own
wants
within
the
circle
of
his
household
his
own
family
and
slaves
and
produced
on
his
farm
the
material
of
his
food
and
clothing
and
the
survival
was
all
the
stronger
because
even
in
the
late
republic
the
abundant
supply
of
slaves
enabled
the
man
of
capital
still
to
dispense
largely
with
the
services
of
the
tradesman
and
artisan
cicero
expresses
this
contempt
for
the
artisan
and
trading
classes
in
more
than
one
striking
passage
one
in
his
treatise
on
duties
is
probably
paraphrased
from
the
greek
of
panaetius
the
philosopher
who
first
introduced
stoicism
to
the
romans
and
modified
it
to
suit
their
temperament
but
it
is
quite
clear
that
cicero
himself
entirely
endorses
the
stoic
view
all
gains
made
by
hired
labourers
he
says
are
dishonourable
and
base
for
what
we
buy
of
them
is
their
labour
not
their
artistic
skill
with
them
the
very
gain
itself
does
but
increase
the
slavishness
of
the
work
all
retail
dealing
too
may
be
put
in
the
same
category
for
the
dealer
will
gain
nothing
except
by
profuse
lying
and
nothing
is
more
disgraceful
than
untruthful
huckstering
again
the
work
of
all
artisans
is
sordid
there
can
be
nothing
honourable
in
a
workshop
if
this
view
of
the
low
character
of
the
work
of
the
artisan
and
retailer
should
be
thought
too
obviously
a
greek
one
let
the
reader
turn
to
the
description
by
livy
a
true
gentleman
of
the
low
origin
of
terentius
varro
the
consul
who
was
in
command
at
cannae
he
uses
the
same
language
as
cicero
he
sprang
from
an
origin
not
merely
humble
but
sordid
his
father
was
a
butcher
who
sold
his
own
meat
and
employed
his
son
in
this
slavish
business
the
story
may
not
be
true
and
indeed
it
is
not
a
very
probable
one
but
it
well
represents
the
inherited
feeling
towards
retail
trade
of
the
roman
of
the
higher
classes
of
society
a
feeling
so
tenacious
of
life
that
even
in
modern
england
where
it
arose
from
much
the
same
causes
as
in
the
ancient
world
it
has
only
within
the
last
century
begun
to
die
out
yet
in
rome
these
humble
workers
existed
and
made
a
living
for
themselves
from
the
very
beginning
as
far
as
we
can
guess
of
real
city
life
they
are
the
necessary
and
inevitable
product
of
the
growth
of
a
town
population
and
of
the
resulting
division
of
labour
the
following
passage
from
a
work
on
industrial
organisation
in
england
may
be
taken
as
closely
representing
the
same
process
in
early
rome
the
town
arose
as
a
centre
in
which
the
surplus
produce
of
many
villages
could
be
profitably
disposed
of
by
exchange
trade
thus
became
a
settled
occupation
and
trade
prepared
the
way
for
the
establishment
of
the
handicrafts
by
furnishing
capital
for
the
support
of
the
craftsmen
and
by
creating
a
regular
market
for
their
products
it
was
possible
for
a
great
many
bodies
of
craftsmen
the
weavers
tailors
butchers
bakers
to
find
a
livelihood
each
craft
devoting
itself
to
the
supply
of
a
single
branch
of
those
wants
which
the
village
household
had
attempted
very
imperfectly
to
satisfy
by
its
own
labours
as
in
mediaeval
europe
so
in
early
rome
the
same
conditions
produced
the
same
results
we
find
the
craftsmen
of
the
town
forming
themselves
into
not
only
for
the
protection
of
their
trade
but
from
a
natural
instinct
of
association
and
providing
these
gilds
on
the
model
of
the
older
groups
of
family
and
gens
with
a
religious
centre
and
a
patron
deity
the
gilds
of
roman
craftsmen
were
attributed
to
numa
like
so
many
other
religious
institutions
they
included
associations
of
weavers
fullers
dyers
shoemakers
doctors
teachers
painters
and
were
mainly
devoted
to
minerva
as
the
deity
of
handiwork
the
society
that
witnessed
the
coming
of
minerva
from
etruria
little
knew
that
in
her
temple
on
the
aventine
was
being
brought
to
expression
the
idea
these
most
unfortunately
pass
entirely
out
of
our
sight
until
they
reappear
in
the
age
of
cicero
in
a
very
different
form
as
clubs
used
for
political
purposes
but
composed
still
of
the
lowest
strata
of
the
free
population
the
history
and
causes
of
their
disappearance
and
metamorphosis
are
lost
to
us
but
it
is
not
hard
to
guess
that
the
main
cause
is
to
be
found
in
the
great
economic
changes
that
followed
the
hannibalic
war
the
vast
number
of
slaves
imported
and
the
consequent
resuscitation
of
the
old
system
of
the
economic
independence
of
the
great
households
the
decay
of
religious
practice
which
affected
both
public
and
private
life
in
a
hundred
different
ways
and
that
steady
growth
of
individualism
which
is
characteristic
of
eras
of
town
life
and
especially
of
the
last
three
centuries
it
is
curious
to
notice
that
by
the
time
these
old
gilds
emerge
into
light
again
as
clubs
that
could
be
used
for
political
purposes
a
new
source
of
gain
and
one
that
was
really
sordid
had
been
placed
within
the
reach
of
the
roman
plebs
urbana
it
was
possible
to
make
money
by
your
vote
in
the
election
of
magistrates
in
that
degenerate
when
the
vast
accumulation
of
capital
made
it
possible
for
a
man
to
purchase
his
way
to
power
in
spite
of
repeated
attempts
to
check
the
evil
by
legislation
the
old
principle
of
honourable
association
was
used
to
help
the
small
man
to
make
a
living
by
choosing
the
unprincipled
and
often
the
incompetent
to
undertake
the
government
of
the
empire
apart
however
from
such
illegal
means
of
making
money
there
was
beyond
doubt
in
the
rome
of
the
last
century
a
large
amount
of
honest
and
useful
labour
done
by
free
citizens
we
must
not
run
away
with
the
idea
that
the
whole
labour
of
the
city
was
performed
by
slaves
who
ousted
the
freeman
from
his
chance
of
a
living
there
was
indeed
a
certain
number
of
public
slaves
who
did
public
work
for
the
state
but
on
the
whole
the
great
mass
of
the
servile
population
worked
entirely
within
the
households
and
on
the
estates
of
the
rich
and
did
not
interfere
to
any
sensible
degree
with
the
labour
of
the
small
freeman
as
has
been
justly
observed
by
salvioli
never
at
any
period
did
the
roman
proletariat
complain
of
the
competition
of
slave
labour
as
detrimental
to
its
own
interests
had
there
been
no
slave
labour
there
the
small
freeman
might
indeed
have
had
a
wider
field
of
enterprise
and
have
been
better
able
to
accumulate
a
small
capital
by
undertaking
work
for
the
great
families
which
was
done
as
it
was
by
their
slaves
but
he
was
not
aware
of
this
and
the
two
kinds
of
labour
the
paid
and
the
unpaid
went
on
side
by
side
without
active
rivalry
no
doubt
slavery
helped
to
foster
idleness
as
it
did
in
the
southern
states
of
america
before
the
civil
war
no
doubt
there
were
plenty
of
idle
ruffians
in
the
city
ready
to
steal
to
murder
or
to
hire
themselves
out
as
the
armed
followers
of
a
political
desperado
like
clodius
but
the
simple
necessities
of
the
life
of
those
who
had
no
slaves
of
their
own
gave
employment
we
may
be
certain
to
a
great
number
of
free
tradesmen
and
artisans
and
labourers
of
a
more
unskilled
kind
to
begin
with
we
may
ask
the
pertinent
question
how
the
corn
sold
cheap
by
the
state
was
made
into
bread
for
the
small
consumer
pliny
gives
us
very
valuable
information
which
we
may
accept
as
roughly
correct
that
until
the
year
there
were
no
bakers
in
rome
the
quirites
he
says
made
their
own
bread
which
was
the
business
of
the
women
as
it
is
still
among
most
peoples
the
demand
which
was
thus
supplied
by
a
new
trade
was
no
doubt
caused
by
the
increase
of
the
lower
population
of
the
city
by
the
return
of
old
soldiers
often
perhaps
unmarried
and
by
the
manumission
of
slaves
many
of
whom
would
also
be
inexperienced
in
domestic
life
and
its
needs
and
we
may
probably
connect
it
with
the
growth
of
the
system
of
insulae
the
great
in
which
it
would
not
be
convenient
either
to
grind
your
corn
or
to
bake
your
bread
so
the
bakers
called
from
the
old
practice
of
pounding
the
grain
in
a
mortar
soon
became
a
very
important
and
flourishing
section
of
the
plebs
though
never
held
in
high
repute
and
in
connexion
with
the
distributions
of
corn
some
of
them
probably
rose
above
the
level
of
the
small
tradesman
like
the
marcus
vergilius
eurysaces
whose
monument
has
come
down
to
us
it
should
be
noted
that
the
trade
of
the
baker
included
the
grinding
of
the
corn
there
were
no
millers
at
rome
this
can
be
well
illustrated
from
the
numerous
bakers
shops
which
have
been
excavated
at
pompeii
in
one
of
these
for
example
we
find
the
four
mills
in
a
large
apartment
at
the
rear
of
the
building
and
close
by
is
the
stall
for
the
donkeys
that
turned
them
and
also
the
oven
and
small
bakeries
may
have
had
only
like
the
one
with
which
we
saw
the
peasant
in
the
grinding
his
corn
but
the
donkey
was
from
quite
early
times
associated
with
the
business
as
we
know
from
the
fact
that
at
the
festival
of
vesta
the
patron
deity
of
all
bakers
they
were
decorated
with
wreaths
and
cakes
the
baking
trade
must
have
given
employment
to
a
large
number
of
persons
so
beyond
doubt
did
the
supply
of
vegetables
which
were
brought
into
the
city
from
gardens
outside
and
formed
after
the
corn
the
staple
food
of
the
lower
classes
we
have
already
seen
in
the
the
countryman
adding
to
his
store
of
bread
by
a
made
of
vegetables
and
the
reader
of
the
poem
will
have
been
astonished
at
the
number
mentioned
including
garden
herbs
for
flavouring
purposes
the
ancients
were
fully
alive
to
the
value
of
vegetable
food
and
of
fruit
as
a
healthy
diet
in
warm
climates
and
the
wonderfully
full
information
we
have
on
this
subject
comes
from
medical
writers
like
galen
as
well
as
from
pliny
and
from
the
writers
on
agriculture
the
very
names
of
some
roman
families
the
fabii
and
caepiones
carry
us
back
to
a
time
when
beans
and
onions
which
later
on
were
not
so
much
in
favour
were
a
regular
part
of
the
diet
of
the
roman
people
the
list
of
vegetables
and
herbs
which
we
know
of
as
consumed
fills
a
whole
page
in
marquardt
interesting
account
of
this
subject
and
includes
most
of
those
which
we
use
at
the
present
day
it
was
only
when
the
consumption
of
meat
and
game
came
in
with
the
growth
of
capital
and
its
attendant
luxury
that
a
vegetarian
diet
came
to
be
at
all
despised
this
is
another
result
of
the
economic
changes
caused
by
the
hannibalic
war
and
is
curiously
illustrated
by
the
speech
of
the
cook
of
a
great
household
in
the
of
plautus
who
prides
himself
on
not
being
as
other
cooks
are
who
make
the
guests
into
beasts
of
the
field
stuffing
them
with
all
kinds
of
food
which
cattle
eat
and
even
with
things
which
cattle
would
refuse
we
may
take
it
that
at
all
times
the
roman
of
the
lower
class
consumed
fruit
and
vegetables
largely
and
thus
gave
employment
to
a
number
of
and
small
purveyors
fish
he
did
not
eat
like
meat
it
was
too
expensive
in
fact
only
came
in
towards
the
end
of
the
republican
period
and
then
only
as
a
luxury
for
those
who
could
afford
to
keep
on
their
estates
how
far
the
supply
of
other
luxuries
such
as
butchers
meat
gave
employment
to
freemen
is
not
very
clear
and
perhaps
we
need
here
only
take
account
of
such
few
other
products
oil
and
wine
as
were
in
universal
demand
though
not
always
procurable
by
the
needy
there
were
plenty
of
small
shops
in
rome
where
these
things
were
sold
we
have
a
picture
of
such
a
shop
in
another
of
the
minor
virgilian
poems
the
hostess
or
perhaps
in
this
case
the
woman
who
danced
and
sang
for
the
entertainment
of
the
guests
she
plied
her
trade
in
a
smoky
tavern
fumosa
taberna
all
the
contents
of
which
are
charmingly
described
in
the
poem
let
us
now
see
how
the
other
chief
necessity
of
human
life
the
supply
of
clothing
gave
employment
to
the
free
roman
shopkeeper
the
clothing
of
the
whole
roman
population
was
originally
woollen
both
the
outer
garment
the
the
inner
were
of
this
material
and
the
sheep
which
supplied
it
were
pastured
well
and
conveniently
in
all
the
higher
hilly
regions
of
italy
other
materials
linen
cotton
and
silk
came
in
later
with
the
growth
of
commerce
but
the
manufacture
of
these
into
clothing
was
chiefly
carried
on
by
slaves
in
the
great
households
and
we
need
not
take
any
account
of
them
here
the
preparation
of
wool
too
was
in
well
regulated
households
undertaken
even
under
the
empire
by
the
women
of
the
family
including
the
materfamilias
herself
and
in
many
an
inscription
we
find
the
recorded
as
the
honourable
practice
of
matrons
but
as
in
the
case
of
food
so
with
the
simple
material
of
clothing
it
was
soon
found
impossible
in
a
city
for
the
poorer
citizens
to
do
all
that
was
necessary
within
their
own
houses
this
is
proved
conclusively
by
the
mention
of
gilds
of
fullers
among
those
traditionally
ascribed
to
numa
fulling
is
the
preparation
of
cloth
by
cleansing
in
water
after
it
has
come
from
the
loom
but
the
fuller
trade
of
the
later
republic
probably
often
comprised
the
actual
manufacture
of
the
wool
for
those
who
could
not
do
it
themselves
he
also
acted
as
the
washer
of
garments
already
in
use
and
this
was
no
doubt
a
very
important
part
of
his
business
for
in
a
warm
climate
heavy
woollen
material
is
naturally
apt
to
get
frequently
impure
and
unwholesome
soap
was
not
known
till
the
first
century
of
the
empire
and
the
process
of
cleansing
was
all
the
more
lengthy
and
elaborate
the
details
of
the
process
are
known
to
us
from
paintings
at
pompeii
where
they
adorn
the
walls
of
fulleries
which
have
been
excavated
a
plan
of
one
of
them
will
be
found
in
mau
the
ordinary
woollen
garments
were
simply
bleached
white
not
dyed
and
though
dyers
are
mentioned
among
the
ancient
gilds
by
plutarch
it
is
probable
that
he
means
chiefly
fullers
by
the
greek
word
of
the
manufacture
of
leather
we
do
not
know
so
much
this
like
that
of
wool
must
have
originally
been
carried
on
in
the
household
but
it
is
mentioned
as
a
trade
as
early
as
the
time
of
plautus
the
shoemakers
business
was
however
a
common
one
from
the
earliest
times
probably
because
it
needs
some
technical
skill
and
experience
the
most
natural
division
of
labour
in
early
societies
is
sure
to
produce
this
trade
the
shoemakers
gild
was
among
the
earliest
and
had
its
centre
in
the
and
the
individual
shoemakers
carried
on
their
trade
in
booths
or
shops
the
roman
shoe
it
may
be
mentioned
here
was
of
several
different
kinds
according
to
the
sex
rank
and
occupation
of
the
wearer
but
the
two
most
important
sorts
were
the
the
shoe
worn
with
the
toga
in
the
city
and
the
mark
of
the
roman
citizen
and
the
or
high
boot
which
was
more
serviceable
in
the
country
among
the
old
gilds
were
also
those
of
the
smiths
and
the
potters
but
of
these
little
need
be
said
here
for
they
were
naturally
fewer
in
number
than
the
vendors
of
food
and
clothing
and
the
raw
material
for
their
work
had
in
later
times
at
least
to
be
brought
from
a
distance
the
later
romans
seem
to
have
procured
their
from
the
island
of
elba
and
spain
gaul
and
other
provinces
and
to
have
imported
ware
of
all
kinds
especially
the
finer
sorts
from
various
parts
of
the
empire
the
commoner
kinds
such
as
the
or
large
vessels
for
storing
wine
and
oil
were
certainly
made
in
rome
in
the
second
century
for
cato
in
his
book
on
agriculture
remarks
that
they
could
be
best
procured
there
but
both
these
manufactures
require
a
certain
amount
of
capital
and
we
may
doubt
whether
the
free
population
was
largely
employed
in
them
we
know
for
certain
that
in
the
early
empire
the
manufacture
of
ware
tiles
bricks
was
carried
on
by
capitalists
some
of
them
of
noble
birth
including
even
emperors
themselves
and
beyond
doubt
the
hands
they
employed
were
chiefly
slaves
but
industries
of
this
kind
may
serve
to
remind
us
of
another
kind
of
employment
in
which
the
lower
classes
of
rome
and
ostia
may
have
found
the
means
of
making
a
living
the
importation
of
raw
materials
and
that
of
goods
of
all
kinds
which
was
constantly
on
the
increase
throughout
roman
history
called
for
the
employment
of
vast
numbers
of
porters
carriers
and
what
we
should
call
dock
hands
working
both
at
ostia
where
the
heavier
ships
were
unladed
or
relieved
of
part
of
their
cargoes
in
order
to
enable
them
to
come
up
the
tiber
and
also
at
the
wharves
at
rome
under
the
aventine
we
must
also
remember
that
almost
all
porterage
in
the
city
had
to
be
done
by
men
with
the
aid
of
mules
or
donkeys
the
streets
were
so
narrow
that
in
trying
to
picture
what
they
looked
like
we
must
banish
from
our
minds
the
crowds
of
vehicles
familiar
in
a
modern
city
julius
caesar
in
his
regulations
for
the
government
of
the
city
of
rome
forbade
waggons
to
be
driven
in
the
streets
in
the
even
supposing
that
a
large
amount
of
porterage
was
done
by
slaves
for
their
masters
we
may
reasonably
guess
that
free
labour
was
also
employed
in
this
way
at
rome
as
was
certainly
the
case
at
ostia
and
also
at
pompeii
where
the
and
are
among
the
corporations
of
free
men
who
have
left
in
the
form
of
appeals
to
voters
to
support
a
particular
candidate
for
election
to
a
magistracy
thus
we
may
safely
conclude
that
there
was
a
very
considerable
amount
of
employment
in
rome
available
for
the
poorer
citizens
quite
apart
from
the
labour
performed
by
slaves
but
before
closing
this
chapter
it
is
necessary
to
point
out
the
precarious
conditions
under
which
that
employment
was
carried
on
as
compared
with
the
industrial
conditions
of
a
modern
city
it
is
true
enough
that
the
factory
system
of
modern
times
with
the
sweating
the
long
hours
of
work
and
the
unwholesome
surroundings
of
our
industrial
towns
has
produced
much
misery
much
physical
degeneracy
and
we
have
also
the
problem
of
the
unemployed
always
with
us
but
there
were
two
points
in
which
the
condition
of
the
free
artisan
and
tradesman
at
rome
was
far
worse
than
it
is
with
us
and
rendered
him
liable
to
an
even
more
hopeless
submersion
than
that
which
is
too
often
the
fate
of
the
modern
first
let
us
consider
that
markets
then
as
now
were
liable
to
fluctuation
probably
more
liable
then
than
now
because
the
supply
both
of
food
and
of
the
raw
material
of
manufacture
was
more
precarious
owing
to
the
greater
difficulties
of
conveyance
trade
would
be
bad
at
times
and
many
things
might
happen
which
would
compel
the
man
with
little
or
no
capital
to
borrow
money
which
he
could
only
do
on
the
security
of
his
stock
or
indeed
as
the
law
of
rome
still
recognised
of
his
person
were
abundant
as
we
shall
find
in
the
next
chapter
interest
was
high
and
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
a
was
only
another
step
on
the
way
to
destruction
at
the
present
day
if
a
tradesman
fails
in
business
he
can
appeal
to
a
merciful
bankruptcy
law
which
gives
him
every
chance
to
satisfy
his
creditors
and
to
start
afresh
or
in
the
case
of
a
single
debt
he
can
be
put
into
a
county
court
where
every
chance
is
given
him
to
pay
it
within
a
reasonable
time
all
this
machinery
most
of
which
to
the
disgrace
of
modern
civilisation
is
quite
recent
in
date
was
absent
at
rome
the
only
magistrates
administering
the
civil
law
were
the
praetors
and
though
since
the
reforms
of
sulla
there
were
usually
eight
of
these
in
the
city
we
can
well
imagine
how
hard
it
would
be
for
the
poor
debtor
in
a
huge
city
to
get
his
affairs
attended
to
probably
in
most
cases
the
creditor
worked
his
will
with
him
took
possession
of
his
property
without
the
interference
of
the
law
and
so
submerged
him
or
even
reduced
him
to
slavery
if
he
chose
to
be
merciful
he
could
go
to
the
praetor
and
get
what
was
called
a
in
a
legal
right
to
take
the
whole
of
his
property
waiving
the
right
to
his
person
and
it
must
be
noted
that
no
more
humane
law
of
bankruptcy
was
introduced
until
the
time
of
augustus
no
wonder
that
at
least
three
times
in
the
last
century
of
the
republic
there
arose
a
cry
for
the
total
abolition
of
debts
in
after
the
social
war
in
during
cicero
consulship
when
political
and
social
revolutionary
projects
were
combined
in
the
conspiracy
of
catiline
and
in
when
the
economic
condition
of
italy
had
been
disturbed
by
the
civil
war
and
caesar
had
much
difficulty
in
keeping
unprincipled
agitators
from
applying
violent
and
foolish
remedies
but
to
this
we
shall
return
in
the
next
chapter
secondly
let
us
consider
that
in
a
large
city
of
the
person
and
property
of
all
rich
or
poor
are
adequately
protected
by
a
sound
system
of
police
and
by
courts
of
first
instance
which
are
sitting
every
day
assault
and
murder
theft
and
burglary
are
exceptional
it
might
be
going
too
far
to
say
that
at
rome
they
were
the
rule
but
it
is
the
fact
that
in
what
we
may
call
the
slums
of
rome
there
was
no
machinery
for
checking
them
no
such
machinery
had
been
invented
because
according
to
the
old
rules
of
law
still
in
force
a
father
might
punish
his
children
a
master
his
slaves
and
a
murderer
or
thief
might
be
killed
by
his
intended
victim
if
caught
this
rude
justice
would
suffice
in
a
small
city
and
a
simple
social
system
but
it
would
be
totally
inadequate
to
protect
life
and
property
in
a
huge
population
such
as
that
of
the
rome
of
the
last
century
since
the
time
of
sulla
there
had
indeed
been
courts
for
the
trial
of
crimes
of
violence
and
at
all
times
the
consuls
with
their
staff
of
assistants
had
been
charged
with
the
peace
of
the
city
but
we
may
well
ask
whether
the
poor
roman
of
cicero
day
could
really
benefit
either
by
the
consular
imperium
or
the
action
of
the
sullan
courts
a
slave
was
the
object
of
his
master
care
and
theft
from
a
slave
was
theft
from
his
owner
if
injured
or
murdered
satisfaction
could
be
had
for
him
but
in
that
age
of
slack
and
sordid
government
it
is
at
least
extremely
doubtful
whether
either
the
person
or
the
property
of
the
lower
class
of
citizen
could
be
said
to
have
been
properly
protected
in
the
city
and
the
same
anarchy
prevailed
all
over
italy
from
the
suburbs
of
rome
infested
by
robbers
to
the
of
the
great
capitalist
where
the
traveller
might
be
kidnapped
by
runaway
slaves
to
vanish
from
the
sight
of
men
without
leaving
a
trace
of
his
fate
it
is
the
great
merit
of
augustus
that
he
made
rome
not
only
a
city
of
marble
but
one
in
which
the
person
and
property
of
all
citizens
were
fairly
secure
by
a
new
and
rational
bankruptcy
law
and
by
a
system
of
police
he
made
life
endurable
even
for
the
poorest
if
he
initiated
a
policy
which
eventually
spoilt
and
degraded
the
roman
population
if
he
failed
to
encourage
free
industry
as
persistently
as
it
seems
to
us
that
he
might
have
done
he
may
perhaps
be
in
some
degree
excused
as
knowing
the
conditions
and
difficulties
of
the
problem
before
him
better
than
we
can
know
them
chapter
iii
the
men
of
business
and
their
methods
the
highest
class
in
the
social
scale
at
rome
was
divided
roughly
rather
than
exactly
into
two
sections
according
as
they
did
or
did
not
aim
at
being
elected
to
magistracies
and
so
entering
the
senate
to
the
senatorius
ordo
which
will
be
dealt
with
in
the
next
chapter
belonged
all
senators
and
all
sons
of
senators
whether
or
no
they
had
as
yet
been
elected
to
the
quaestorship
which
after
sulla
was
the
magistracy
qualifying
for
the
senate
but
outside
the
senatorial
ranks
there
were
numbers
of
wealthy
and
well
educated
men
most
of
whom
were
engaged
in
one
way
or
another
in
business
by
which
term
is
here
meant
not
so
much
trading
and
mercantile
operations
as
banking
the
undertaking
of
state
contracts
and
the
raising
of
taxes
the
general
name
for
this
class
was
strange
to
say
equites
or
knights
as
they
are
often
but
unfortunately
called
in
modern
histories
of
rome
they
were
in
fact
at
this
time
the
most
unmilitary
part
of
the
population
and
they
inherited
the
title
only
because
the
property
qualification
for
the
equites
equo
privato
the
cavalry
who
served
with
their
horses
had
been
taken
as
the
qualification
also
for
equestrian
judices
to
whom
gaius
gracchus
had
given
the
decision
of
cases
in
the
quaestio
de
repetundis
this
law
of
gracchus
had
had
the
result
of
constituting
an
ordo
equester
alongside
of
the
ordo
senatorius
with
a
property
qualification
of
sesterces
or
about
not
of
income
but
of
capital
any
one
who
had
this
sum
could
call
himself
an
eques
provided
he
were
not
a
senator
even
if
he
had
never
served
in
the
cavalry
or
mounted
a
horse
we
are
concerned
here
with
the
business
which
these
men
carried
on
not
with
their
history
as
a
body
in
the
state
this
latter
difficult
subject
has
been
handled
by
greenidge
in
his
public
and
by
many
other
writers
we
have
to
take
them
here
as
the
representatives
of
capital
and
the
chief
uses
to
which
it
was
put
in
the
age
of
cicero
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
then
doing
by
far
the
greatest
part
of
the
of
the
empire
they
were
not
indeed
always
doing
it
for
themselves
they
often
represented
men
of
senatorial
rank
and
acted
as
their
agents
in
the
investment
of
money
and
in
securing
the
returns
due
for
the
senator
was
not
allowed
by
the
strict
letter
of
the
law
to
engage
in
business
which
would
take
him
out
of
italy
his
services
were
needed
at
home
and
if
indeed
he
had
performed
his
proper
work
with
industry
and
energy
he
never
could
have
found
time
to
travel
on
his
own
business
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
speaking
there
were
ways
in
which
he
could
escape
from
his
duties
ways
only
too
often
used
but
many
senators
did
undoubtedly
employ
members
of
the
equestrian
order
to
transact
their
business
abroad
so
that
it
is
not
untrue
to
say
that
the
equites
had
in
their
hands
almost
the
whole
of
the
monetary
business
of
the
empire
the
property
qualification
may
seem
to
us
small
enough
but
it
is
of
course
no
real
index
to
the
amount
of
capital
which
a
wealthy
eques
might
possess
nothing
is
more
astonishing
in
the
history
of
the
last
century
of
the
republic
than
the
vast
sums
of
money
in
the
hands
of
individuals
and
the
enormous
sums
lent
and
borrowed
in
private
by
the
men
whose
names
are
familiar
to
us
as
statesmen
it
is
told
of
caesar
that
as
a
very
young
man
he
owed
a
sum
equivalent
to
about
of
crassus
that
he
had
million
sesterces
invested
in
land
alone
cicero
though
from
time
to
time
in
difficulties
always
found
it
possible
to
borrow
the
large
sums
which
he
spent
on
houses
libraries
etc
these
are
men
of
the
ordo
senatorius
of
the
equites
proper
the
men
who
dealt
rather
in
lending
than
borrowing
we
have
not
such
explicit
accounts
because
they
were
not
in
the
same
degree
before
the
public
but
of
atticus
the
type
of
the
best
and
highest
section
of
the
ordo
equester
and
of
the
amount
and
the
sources
of
his
wealth
we
happen
to
know
a
good
deal
from
the
little
biography
of
him
written
by
his
contemporary
and
friend
cornelius
nepos
taken
together
with
cicero
numerous
letters
to
him
his
father
had
left
him
the
moderate
fortune
of
with
this
he
bought
land
not
in
italy
but
in
epirus
where
it
was
probably
to
be
had
cheap
the
profits
arising
from
this
land
with
which
he
took
no
doubt
much
trouble
and
pains
he
invested
again
in
other
ways
he
lent
money
to
greek
cities
to
athens
indeed
without
claiming
any
interest
to
sicyon
without
much
hope
of
repayment
but
no
doubt
to
many
others
at
a
large
profit
he
also
undertook
the
publishing
of
books
buying
slaves
who
were
skilled
copyists
and
in
this
as
in
so
many
other
ways
his
friendship
was
of
infinite
value
to
cicero
when
we
reflect
that
every
highly
educated
man
at
this
time
owned
a
library
and
wished
to
have
the
last
new
book
we
can
understand
how
even
this
business
might
be
extensive
and
profitable
and
are
not
astonished
to
find
cicero
asking
atticus
to
see
that
copies
of
his
greek
book
on
his
own
consulship
were
to
be
had
in
athens
and
other
greek
towns
this
shrewd
man
also
invested
in
gladiators
whom
he
could
let
out
at
a
profit
as
no
doubt
he
would
let
out
his
library
slaves
lastly
he
owned
houses
in
rome
in
fact
he
must
have
been
making
money
in
many
different
ways
spending
little
himself
and
attending
personally
and
indefatigably
to
all
his
business
as
indeed
with
true
and
disinterested
friendship
he
attended
to
that
of
cicero
in
him
we
see
the
best
type
of
the
roman
businessman
not
the
bloated
millionaire
living
in
coarse
luxury
but
the
man
who
loved
to
be
always
busy
for
himself
or
his
friends
and
whose
knowledge
of
men
and
things
was
so
thorough
that
he
could
make
a
fortune
without
anxiety
to
himself
or
discomfort
to
others
what
amount
of
capital
he
realised
in
these
various
ways
we
do
not
know
but
the
mass
of
his
fortune
came
to
him
after
he
had
been
pursuing
them
for
many
years
in
the
form
of
a
legacy
from
an
uncle
this
uncle
was
a
typical
capitalist
and
of
a
much
lower
and
coarser
type
than
his
nephew
nepos
aptly
describes
him
as
familiarem
luculli
divitem
the
nephew
was
the
only
man
who
could
get
on
with
this
peter
featherstone
of
roman
life
and
this
simple
fact
tells
us
as
much
about
the
character
and
disposition
of
atticus
as
anything
in
cicero
correspondence
with
him
the
happy
result
was
that
his
uncle
left
him
a
sum
which
we
may
reckon
at
about
and
henceforward
he
may
be
reckoned
if
not
as
a
millionaire
at
any
rate
as
a
man
of
large
capital
soundly
invested
and
continually
on
the
increase
there
is
no
doubt
then
as
to
the
fact
of
the
presence
of
capital
on
a
large
scale
in
the
rome
of
the
last
century
or
of
the
business
talents
of
many
of
its
holders
or
again
of
the
many
profitable
ways
in
which
it
might
be
invested
but
in
order
to
learn
a
little
more
of
the
history
of
capital
at
rome
which
is
of
the
utmost
importance
for
a
proper
understanding
not
only
of
the
economic
but
of
the
social
and
ethical
characteristics
of
the
age
it
is
necessary
to
go
as
far
back
as
the
war
with
hannibal
at
least
that
there
had
been
surplus
capital
in
the
hands
of
individuals
long
before
the
war
with
hannibal
is
a
well
known
fact
proved
by
the
old
roman
law
of
debt
and
by
the
traditions
of
the
unhappy
relations
of
debtor
and
creditor
but
in
order
not
to
go
back
too
far
we
may
notice
a
striking
fact
which
meets
us
at
the
very
outset
of
that
momentous
war
in
and
again
the
next
year
the
treasury
was
almost
empty
then
for
the
first
time
so
far
as
we
know
private
individuals
came
to
the
rescue
and
lent
large
sums
to
the
state
these
were
partners
in
certain
associations
to
be
described
later
on
in
this
chapter
which
had
made
money
by
undertaking
state
contracts
in
the
previous
wars
the
presence
of
hannibal
in
italy
strained
the
resources
of
the
state
to
the
utmost
in
every
way
it
cut
the
romans
off
from
their
supply
of
the
precious
metals
forced
them
to
reduce
the
weight
of
the
to
one
ounce
and
curiously
enough
also
to
issue
gold
coins
for
the
first
time
a
measure
probably
taken
on
account
of
the
dearth
of
silver
and
to
make
use
of
the
uncoined
gold
in
the
treasury
or
in
private
hands
at
the
end
of
the
war
the
supply
of
silver
was
recovered
henceforward
all
reckonings
were
made
in
silver
and
the
gold
coinage
was
not
long
continued
at
this
happy
time
when
rome
felt
that
she
could
breathe
again
after
the
final
defeat
of
her
deadly
enemy
began
the
great
inpouring
of
wealth
of
which
the
capitalism
of
cicero
time
is
the
direct
result
the
chief
sources
of
this
wealth
so
far
as
the
state
was
concerned
were
the
indemnities
paid
by
conquered
peoples
especially
carthage
and
antiochus
of
syria
and
the
booty
brought
home
by
victorious
generals
of
these
livy
has
preserved
explicit
accounts
and
the
best
example
is
perhaps
that
of
the
booty
brought
by
scipio
asiaticus
from
asia
minor
in
of
which
pliny
remarks
that
it
first
introduced
luxury
into
italy
it
has
been
roughly
computed
that
the
total
amount
from
indemnities
may
be
taken
at
six
million
of
our
pounds
in
the
period
of
the
great
wars
of
the
second
century
and
from
booty
very
much
the
same
sum
besides
this
we
have
to
take
account
of
the
produce
of
the
spanish
silver
mines
of
which
the
romans
came
into
possession
with
the
carthaginian
dominions
in
spain
the
richest
of
these
were
near
carthago
nova
and
polybius
tells
us
that
in
his
day
they
employed
miners
and
produced
an
immense
revenue
all
this
went
into
the
aerarium
except
what
was
distributed
out
of
the
booty
to
the
soldiers
both
romans
and
socii
the
former
naturally
taking
as
a
rule
double
the
amount
paid
to
the
latter
but
the
influx
of
treasure
into
the
state
coffers
soon
began
to
tell
upon
the
financial
welfare
of
the
whole
citizen
community
the
most
striking
proof
of
this
is
the
fact
that
in
after
the
second
macedonian
war
the
or
was
no
longer
imposed
upon
all
citizens
henceforward
the
roman
citizen
had
hardly
any
burdens
to
bear
except
the
necessity
of
military
service
and
there
are
very
distinct
signs
that
he
was
beginning
to
be
unwilling
to
bear
even
that
one
he
saw
the
prominent
men
of
his
time
enriching
themselves
abroad
and
leading
luxurious
lives
and
the
spirit
of
ease
and
idleness
began
inevitably
to
affect
him
too
polybius
indeed
writing
about
declines
to
state
positively
that
the
great
romans
were
corrupt
or
extortionate
and
those
who
were
his
intimate
friends
aemilius
paullus
and
his
sons
were
distinguished
for
their
abstinentia
but
the
mere
occurrence
of
this
word
abstinentia
in
the
epitomes
of
livy
lost
books
which
dealt
with
this
time
betrays
the
fact
too
obviously
in
was
passed
the
first
of
the
long
series
of
laws
intended
but
in
vain
to
check
the
tendency
of
provincial
governors
to
extort
money
from
their
subjects
and
as
this
law
established
for
the
first
time
a
standing
court
to
try
offences
of
this
kind
the
inference
is
inevitable
that
such
offences
were
common
and
on
the
increase
the
remarkable
fact
about
this
inpouring
of
wealth
is
its
extraordinary
suddenness
within
the
lifetime
of
a
single
individual
cato
the
censor
who
died
an
old
man
in
the
financial
condition
of
the
state
and
of
individuals
had
undergone
a
complete
change
cato
loved
to
make
money
and
knew
very
well
how
to
do
it
as
his
own
treatise
on
agriculture
plainly
shows
but
he
wished
to
do
it
in
a
legitimate
way
and
to
spend
profitably
the
money
he
made
and
he
spared
no
pains
to
prevent
others
from
making
it
illegally
and
spending
it
unprofitably
he
saw
clearly
that
the
sudden
influx
of
wealth
was
disturbing
the
balance
of
the
roman
mind
and
that
the
desire
to
make
money
was
taking
the
place
of
the
idea
of
duty
to
the
state
he
knew
that
no
roman
could
serve
two
masters
mammon
and
the
state
and
that
mammon
was
getting
the
upper
hand
in
his
views
of
life
if
the
accumulation
of
wealth
had
been
gradual
instead
of
sudden
natural
instead
of
artificial
this
could
hardly
have
happened
as
in
england
from
the
fourteenth
century
onwards
the
steady
growth
of
capital
would
have
produced
no
ethical
mischief
no
false
economic
ideas
because
it
would
have
been
an
growth
resting
upon
a
sound
and
natural
economic
basis
as
the
french
historian
has
said
with
singular
felicity
money
is
like
water
of
a
river
if
it
suddenly
floods
it
devastates
divide
it
into
a
thousand
channels
where
it
circulates
quietly
and
it
brings
life
and
fertility
to
every
spot
it
was
in
this
period
of
the
great
wars
so
unwholesome
and
perilous
economically
that
the
men
of
business
as
defined
at
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
the
men
of
capital
outside
the
ordo
senatorius
first
rose
to
real
importance
in
the
century
that
followed
and
as
we
see
them
more
especially
in
cicero
correspondence
they
became
a
great
power
in
the
state
and
not
only
in
rome
but
in
every
corner
of
the
empire
we
have
now
to
see
how
they
gained
this
importance
and
this
power
and
what
use
they
made
of
their
capital
and
their
opportunities
this
is
not
usually
explained
or
illustrated
in
the
ordinary
histories
of
rome
yet
it
is
impossible
without
explaining
it
to
understand
either
the
social
or
the
public
life
of
the
rome
of
this
period
the
men
of
business
may
be
divided
into
two
classes
according
as
they
undertook
work
for
the
state
or
on
their
own
account
entirely
it
does
not
follow
that
these
two
classes
were
mutually
exclusive
a
man
might
very
well
invest
his
money
in
both
kinds
of
undertaking
but
these
two
kinds
were
totally
distinct
and
called
by
different
names
a
public
undertaking
was
called
and
the
men
who
undertook
it
a
private
undertaking
was
and
all
private
business
men
were
known
as
the
publicani
were
always
organised
in
companies
the
negotiatores
might
be
in
private
partnership
with
one
or
more
partners
but
as
a
rule
seem
to
have
been
single
individuals
we
will
deal
first
with
the
publicani
in
a
passage
of
livy
quoted
just
now
it
is
stated
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
hannibalic
war
money
was
advanced
to
the
state
by
societates
publicanorum
livy
also
happens
to
mention
that
three
of
these
competed
for
the
privilege
thus
it
is
clear
that
the
system
of
getting
public
work
done
by
contract
was
in
full
operation
before
that
date
together
with
the
practice
on
the
part
of
the
contractors
of
uniting
in
partnerships
to
lessen
the
risk
system
and
practice
are
equally
natural
and
it
needs
but
a
little
historical
imagination
to
realise
their
development
as
the
roman
state
became
involved
in
wars
leading
to
the
conquest
of
italy
and
in
due
time
to
the
acquisition
of
dominions
beyond
sea
armies
and
fleets
had
to
be
equipped
and
provisioned
roads
had
to
be
made
public
rents
to
be
got
in
new
buildings
to
be
erected
for
public
convenience
or
worship
corn
had
to
be
procured
for
the
growing
population
and
above
all
taxes
had
to
be
collected
both
in
italy
and
in
the
provinces
as
these
were
severally
acquired
the
government
had
no
apparatus
for
carrying
out
these
undertakings
itself
it
had
not
as
we
have
separate
departments
or
bureaux
with
a
permanent
staff
of
officials
attached
to
each
and
even
if
it
had
been
so
provided
it
would
still
have
found
it
most
convenient
as
modern
governments
also
do
to
get
the
necessary
work
carried
out
in
most
cases
by
private
contractors
every
five
years
the
censors
let
the
various
works
by
auction
to
contracting
companies
who
engaged
to
carry
them
out
for
fixed
sums
and
make
what
profit
they
could
out
of
the
business
this
saved
an
immense
amount
of
trouble
to
the
senate
and
magistrates
who
were
usually
busily
engaged
in
other
matters
nor
was
there
at
first
any
harm
in
the
system
so
long
as
the
romans
were
morally
sound
and
incapable
of
jobbing
or
scamping
their
work
the
very
fact
that
they
united
into
companies
for
the
purpose
of
undertaking
these
contracts
shows
that
they
were
aware
of
the
risk
involved
and
wished
as
far
as
possible
to
neutralise
it
it
did
not
mean
greed
for
money
but
rather
anxiety
not
to
lose
the
capital
invested
but
as
rome
advanced
her
dominion
in
the
second
century
and
had
to
see
to
an
amount
of
public
business
it
was
discovered
that
the
business
of
contracting
was
one
which
might
indeed
be
risky
but
with
skill
and
experience
and
especially
with
a
trifle
of
unscrupulousness
might
be
made
a
perfectly
safe
and
paying
investment
this
was
especially
the
case
with
the
undertakings
for
raising
the
taxes
in
the
newly
acquired
provinces
as
well
as
in
italy
more
particularly
in
those
provinces
viz
sicily
and
asia
which
paid
their
taxes
in
the
form
of
tithe
and
not
in
a
lump
sum
the
collection
of
these
revenues
could
be
made
a
very
paying
concern
seeing
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
be
too
squeamish
about
the
rights
and
claims
of
the
provincials
and
indeed
by
the
time
of
the
gracchi
all
these
companies
had
become
the
one
favourite
investment
in
which
every
one
who
had
any
capital
however
small
placed
it
without
hesitation
polybius
who
was
in
rome
at
this
time
for
several
years
and
was
thoroughly
acquainted
with
roman
life
has
left
a
valuable
record
in
his
sixth
book
ch
xvii
of
the
universal
demand
for
shares
in
these
companies
a
fact
which
proves
that
they
were
believed
to
be
both
safe
and
profitable
these
societates
were
managed
by
the
great
men
of
business
as
our
companies
are
directed
by
men
of
capital
and
consequence
polybius
tells
us
that
among
those
who
were
concerned
some
took
the
contracts
from
the
censors
these
were
called
because
the
sign
of
accepting
the
contract
at
the
auction
was
to
hold
up
the
hand
others
polybius
goes
on
were
in
association
with
these
mancipes
and
as
we
may
assume
equally
responsible
with
them
these
were
the
it
was
of
course
necessary
that
security
should
be
given
for
the
fulfilment
of
the
contract
and
polybius
does
not
omit
to
mention
the
or
guarantors
lastly
he
says
that
others
again
gave
their
property
on
behalf
of
these
official
members
of
the
companies
or
in
their
name
for
the
public
purpose
in
hand
these
last
words
admit
of
more
than
one
interpretation
but
as
in
the
same
passage
polybius
tells
us
that
all
who
had
any
money
put
it
into
these
concerns
we
may
reasonably
suppose
that
he
means
to
indicate
the
or
small
holders
of
shares
which
were
called
or
if
very
small
the
socii
and
participes
seem
to
be
distinguished
by
cicero
in
his
verrine
orations
ii
where
he
quotes
an
addition
made
by
verres
illegally
as
praetor
to
a
lex
censoria
qui
de
censoribus
redemerit
eum
socium
ne
admittito
neve
partem
dato
if
this
be
so
we
may
regard
the
socius
as
having
a
share
both
in
the
management
and
the
liability
while
the
particeps
merely
put
his
money
into
the
undertaking
the
actual
management
on
which
polybius
is
silent
was
in
rome
in
the
hands
of
a
changing
yearly
like
the
magistrates
of
the
state
and
in
the
provinces
of
a
answering
to
the
with
a
large
staff
of
assistants
communications
between
the
management
at
home
and
that
in
the
provinces
were
kept
up
by
messengers
who
were
chiefly
slaves
and
it
is
interesting
incidentally
to
notice
that
these
who
are
constantly
mentioned
in
cicero
letters
also
acted
as
for
private
persons
to
whom
their
employers
were
known
such
a
business
as
this
involving
the
interests
of
so
many
citizens
must
have
necessitated
something
very
like
the
stock
exchange
or
bourse
of
modern
times
and
in
fact
the
basilicas
and
porticoes
which
we
met
with
in
the
forum
during
our
walk
through
rome
did
actually
serve
this
purpose
the
reader
of
cicero
letters
will
have
noticed
how
often
the
forum
is
spoken
of
as
the
centre
of
life
at
rome
going
down
to
the
forum
was
indeed
the
equivalent
of
going
into
the
city
as
well
as
of
going
down
to
westminster
all
who
had
investments
in
the
societates
would
wish
to
know
the
latest
news
brought
by
from
the
provinces
of
the
state
of
the
crop
in
sicily
or
asia
or
of
the
disposition
of
some
provincial
governor
towards
the
publicani
of
his
province
or
again
of
the
approach
of
some
enemy
such
as
mithridates
or
ariovistus
who
by
defeating
a
roman
army
might
break
into
roman
territory
and
destroy
the
prospects
of
a
successful
contractual
enterprise
assuredly
cicero
love
for
the
forum
was
not
a
political
one
only
he
loved
it
indeed
as
the
scene
of
his
great
triumphs
as
an
advocate
but
also
no
doubt
because
he
was
concerned
in
some
of
the
companies
which
had
their
headquarters
there
when
urging
the
people
to
give
pompeius
extraordinary
powers
to
drive
mithridates
out
of
reach
of
roman
asia
where
he
had
done
incalculable
damage
he
dwells
both
with
knowledge
and
feeling
on
the
value
of
the
province
not
only
to
the
state
but
to
innumerable
private
citizens
who
had
their
money
invested
in
its
revenues
if
some
he
pleads
lose
their
whole
fortunes
they
will
drag
many
more
down
with
them
save
the
state
from
such
a
calamity
and
believe
me
though
you
see
it
well
enough
that
the
whole
system
of
credit
and
finance
which
is
carried
on
here
at
rome
in
the
forum
is
inextricably
bound
up
with
the
revenues
of
the
asiatic
province
if
those
revenues
are
destroyed
our
whole
system
of
credit
will
come
down
with
a
crash
see
that
you
do
not
hesitate
for
a
moment
to
prosecute
with
all
your
energies
a
war
by
which
the
glory
of
the
roman
name
the
safety
of
our
allies
our
most
valuable
revenues
and
the
fortunes
of
innumerable
citizens
will
be
effectually
preserved
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
way
in
which
political
questions
might
be
decided
in
the
interests
of
capital
and
it
is
all
the
more
striking
because
a
few
years
earlier
sulla
had
done
all
he
could
to
weaken
the
capitalists
as
a
distinct
class
pompeius
went
out
with
abnormal
powers
and
might
be
considered
for
the
time
as
their
representative
the
result
in
this
case
was
on
the
whole
good
for
the
work
he
did
in
the
east
was
of
permanent
value
to
the
empire
but
the
constitution
was
shaken
and
never
wholly
recovered
and
nothing
that
he
was
able
to
do
could
restore
the
unfortunate
province
of
asia
to
its
former
prosperity
four
years
later
the
company
which
had
contracted
for
raising
the
taxes
in
the
province
sought
to
repudiate
their
bargain
this
was
disgraceful
as
cicero
himself
expressly
says
but
it
is
quite
possible
that
they
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
the
money
in
and
feared
a
dead
loss
owing
to
the
impoverishment
of
the
provincials
this
matter
again
led
to
a
political
crisis
for
the
senate
urged
by
cato
was
disposed
to
refuse
the
concession
and
the
alliance
between
the
senatorial
class
and
the
business
men
which
it
had
been
particular
policy
to
confirm
in
order
to
mass
together
all
men
of
property
against
the
dangers
of
socialism
and
anarchy
was
thereby
threatened
so
seriously
that
it
ceased
to
be
a
factor
in
politics
these
companies
and
their
agents
were
indeed
destined
to
be
a
thorn
in
cicero
side
as
a
provincial
governor
himself
when
called
upon
to
rule
cilicia
in
he
found
the
people
quite
unable
to
pay
their
taxes
and
driven
into
the
hands
of
the
middleman
in
order
to
do
so
his
sympathies
were
thus
divided
between
the
unfortunate
provincials
for
whom
he
felt
a
genuine
pity
and
the
interests
of
the
company
for
collecting
the
cilician
taxes
and
of
those
who
had
invested
their
money
in
its
funds
in
his
edict
issued
before
his
entrance
into
the
province
he
had
tried
to
balance
the
conflicting
interests
writing
of
it
to
atticus
who
had
naturally
as
a
capitalist
been
anxious
to
know
what
he
was
doing
he
says
that
he
is
doing
all
he
can
for
the
publicani
coaxing
them
praising
them
yielding
to
them
but
taking
care
that
they
do
no
mischief
words
which
perhaps
did
not
altogether
satisfy
his
friend
all
honest
provincial
governors
especially
in
the
eastern
provinces
which
had
been
the
scene
of
continual
wars
for
nearly
three
centuries
found
themselves
in
the
same
difficulty
they
were
continually
beset
by
urgent
appeals
on
behalf
of
the
and
their
agents
appeals
made
without
a
thought
of
the
condition
of
a
province
or
its
capacity
so
completely
had
the
idea
of
making
money
taken
possession
of
the
roman
mind
among
the
letters
of
cicero
are
many
such
appeals
sent
by
himself
to
other
provincial
governors
some
of
them
while
he
was
himself
in
cilicia
we
may
take
two
as
examples
before
bringing
this
part
of
our
subject
to
a
close
the
first
of
these
letters
is
to
silius
nerva
propraetor
of
bithynia
a
province
recently
added
to
the
empire
by
pompeius
cicero
here
says
that
he
is
himself
closely
connected
with
the
partners
in
the
company
for
collecting
the
scriptura
of
the
province
not
only
because
that
company
as
a
body
is
my
client
but
also
because
i
am
very
intimate
with
most
of
the
individual
partners
can
we
doubt
that
he
was
himself
a
shareholder
he
urges
nerva
to
do
all
he
can
for
terentius
hispo
the
of
the
company
and
to
try
to
secure
for
him
the
means
of
making
all
the
necessary
arrangements
with
the
taxed
communities
relying
we
are
glad
to
find
on
the
tact
and
kindness
of
the
governor
the
second
letter
to
his
own
furius
crassipes
quaestor
of
bithynia
shall
be
quoted
here
in
full
from
shuckburgh
translation
though
in
a
personal
interview
i
recommended
as
earnestly
as
i
could
the
publicani
of
bithynia
and
though
i
gathered
that
by
your
own
inclination
no
less
than
from
my
recommendation
you
were
anxious
to
promote
the
advantage
of
that
company
in
every
way
in
your
power
i
have
not
hesitated
to
write
you
this
since
those
interested
thought
it
of
great
importance
that
i
should
inform
you
what
my
feeling
towards
them
was
i
wish
you
to
believe
that
while
i
have
ever
had
the
greatest
pleasure
in
doing
all
i
can
for
the
order
of
publicani
generally
yet
this
particular
company
of
bithynia
has
my
special
good
wishes
owing
to
the
rank
and
birth
of
its
members
this
company
constitutes
a
very
important
part
of
the
state
for
it
is
made
up
of
members
of
the
other
companies
and
it
so
happens
that
a
very
large
number
of
its
members
are
extremely
intimate
with
me
and
especially
the
man
who
is
at
present
at
the
head
of
the
business
rupilius
its
such
being
the
case
i
beg
you
with
more
than
common
earnestness
to
protect
cn
pupius
an
employ√©
of
the
company
by
every
sort
of
kindness
and
liberality
in
your
power
and
to
secure
as
you
easily
may
that
his
services
shall
be
as
satisfactory
as
possible
to
the
company
while
at
the
same
time
securing
and
promoting
the
property
and
interests
of
the
partners
as
to
which
i
am
well
aware
how
much
power
a
quaestor
possesses
you
will
be
doing
me
in
this
matter
a
very
great
favour
and
i
can
myself
from
personal
experience
pledge
you
my
word
that
you
will
find
the
partners
of
the
bithynia
company
gratefully
mindful
of
any
services
you
can
do
them
if
cicero
the
most
of
roman
public
men
could
urge
the
claims
of
the
companies
so
strongly
and
as
in
this
last
letter
without
any
allusion
to
the
interests
of
the
province
and
its
people
we
may
well
imagine
how
others
less
scrupulous
must
have
combined
with
the
capitalists
to
work
havoc
in
regions
that
only
needed
peace
and
mild
government
to
recover
from
centuries
of
misery
such
a
letter
is
the
best
comment
we
can
have
on
the
pernicious
system
of
raising
taxes
by
contract
a
system
which
was
to
be
modified
regulated
and
eventually
reduced
to
harmless
dimensions
under
the
benevolent
and
scientific
government
of
the
early
empire
we
must
now
turn
to
the
other
department
of
the
activity
of
the
men
of
business
that
of
banking
and
on
the
north
or
sunny
side
of
the
forum
we
noticed
in
our
walk
round
the
city
the
shops
of
the
bankers
the
were
originally
as
their
name
suggests
only
a
class
of
small
business
men
that
arose
in
response
to
a
need
felt
as
soon
as
increasing
commerce
and
extended
empire
brought
foreign
coin
in
large
quantities
to
rome
the
italian
communities
outside
the
roman
state
issued
their
own
coinage
until
they
were
admitted
to
the
civitas
after
the
social
war
a
fact
which
alone
is
sufficient
to
show
the
need
of
men
who
made
it
their
business
to
know
the
current
value
of
various
coins
in
roman
money
and
as
rome
became
involved
in
the
affairs
of
the
east
there
were
always
circulating
in
the
city
the
tetradrachms
of
antioch
and
alexandria
the
rhodian
drachmas
and
the
cistophori
of
the
kings
of
pergamus
afterwards
coined
in
the
province
of
asia
no
doubt
the
business
was
a
profitable
one
and
itself
led
to
the
formation
of
capital
which
could
be
used
in
taking
deposits
and
making
advances
and
as
professor
purser
puts
it
the
mere
possession
of
a
quantity
of
coin
for
purposes
of
change
would
be
likely
to
develop
spontaneously
the
profession
of
banking
in
the
same
way
the
or
assayers
of
the
coin
having
a
mass
of
it
in
their
hands
would
tend
to
develop
a
private
business
as
well
as
their
official
public
one
all
these
argentarii
or
nummularii
might
be
called
from
the
interest
which
they
charged
in
their
transactions
the
profession
was
a
respectable
one
for
honesty
and
exactness
in
accounts
were
absolutely
necessary
to
success
in
it
if
the
reader
will
turn
to
cicero
speech
in
defence
of
caecina
he
will
find
these
accounts
appealed
to
though
apparently
not
actually
produced
in
court
but
in
the
of
aulus
gellius
xiv
a
judge
who
is
describing
a
civil
case
which
came
before
him
mentions
among
the
documents
produced
the
accounts
kept
by
the
banker
your
argentarius
seems
to
have
been
ready
to
undertake
for
you
almost
all
that
a
modern
banker
will
do
for
his
customer
he
would
take
deposits
of
money
either
for
the
depositor
use
or
to
bear
interest
and
would
make
payments
on
his
behalf
on
receipt
of
a
written
order
answering
to
our
cheque
this
was
a
practice
probably
introduced
from
greece
for
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
the
whole
business
of
credit
and
exchange
had
long
been
reduced
to
a
system
again
if
you
wished
to
be
supplied
with
money
during
a
journey
or
to
pay
a
sum
to
any
one
at
a
distance
in
greece
or
asia
your
argentarius
would
arrange
it
for
you
by
giving
you
letters
of
credit
or
bills
of
exchange
on
a
banker
at
such
towns
as
you
might
mention
and
so
save
you
the
trouble
of
carrying
a
heavy
weight
of
coin
with
you
when
cicero
sent
his
son
to
the
university
of
athens
he
wished
to
give
him
a
generous
allowance
too
generous
as
we
should
think
for
it
amounted
to
about
a
year
and
he
asked
atticus
whether
it
could
be
managed
for
him
by
exchange
and
received
an
affirmative
answer
so
too
when
his
beloved
freedman
secretary
tiro
fell
ill
of
fever
at
patrae
cicero
finds
it
easy
to
get
a
local
banker
there
to
advance
him
all
the
money
he
needed
and
to
pay
the
doctor
engaging
himself
to
repay
the
money
to
any
agent
whom
the
banker
might
name
your
argentarius
would
also
attend
for
you
or
appoint
an
agent
to
attend
at
any
public
auction
in
which
you
were
interested
as
seller
or
purchaser
and
would
pay
or
receive
the
money
for
you
a
practice
which
must
have
greatly
helped
him
in
getting
to
know
the
current
value
of
all
kinds
of
property
and
indeed
in
learning
to
understand
human
nature
on
its
business
side
in
the
passage
from
the
quoted
just
now
a
lady
caesennia
wished
to
buy
an
estate
she
employs
an
agent
aebutius
no
doubt
recommended
by
her
banker
and
to
him
the
estate
is
knocked
down
he
undertakes
that
the
argentarius
of
the
vendor
who
is
present
at
the
auction
shall
be
paid
the
value
and
this
is
ultimately
done
by
caesennia
and
the
sum
entered
in
the
banker
books
tabulae
but
perhaps
the
most
important
part
of
the
business
was
the
finding
money
for
those
who
were
in
want
of
it
making
advances
on
interest
the
poor
man
who
was
in
need
of
ready
money
could
get
it
from
the
argentarius
in
coin
if
he
had
any
security
to
offer
and
as
we
saw
in
the
last
chapter
might
get
entangled
more
and
more
hopelessly
in
the
nets
of
the
whether
the
same
argentarius
did
this
small
business
and
also
the
work
of
supplying
the
rich
man
with
credit
we
do
not
know
it
may
have
been
the
case
that
the
great
like
atticus
themselves
employed
argentarii
and
so
kept
them
going
that
atticus
would
undertake
anyhow
for
a
friend
like
cicero
any
amount
of
we
know
well
from
many
letters
of
cicero
written
when
he
was
anxious
to
buy
a
piece
of
land
at
any
cost
on
which
to
erect
a
shrine
to
his
beloved
daughter
and
we
may
be
pretty
sure
that
atticus
could
not
have
done
all
that
cicero
importunately
pressed
upon
him
if
he
had
not
had
a
number
of
useful
professional
agents
at
command
from
these
same
letters
we
also
learn
that
finding
money
by
no
means
necessarily
meant
finding
coin
in
a
society
where
every
one
was
lending
or
borrowing
and
probably
doing
both
at
the
same
time
what
actually
passed
was
chiefly
securities
mortgages
debts
and
so
on
if
you
wanted
to
hand
over
a
hundred
thousand
or
so
to
a
creditor
what
your
agent
had
as
often
as
not
to
do
was
to
persuade
that
creditor
to
accept
as
payment
the
debts
owing
to
yourself
from
others
you
would
hand
over
to
him
if
he
would
accept
them
the
bonds
or
other
securities
given
you
by
your
own
debtors
it
is
plain
then
that
the
had
an
enormous
business
even
in
rome
alone
and
risky
as
it
undoubtedly
was
it
must
often
have
been
a
profitable
one
and
it
was
not
only
at
rome
that
men
were
borrowing
and
lending
but
over
the
whole
empire
for
reasons
which
it
would
need
an
economic
treatise
to
explain
private
men
cities
and
even
kings
were
in
want
of
money
it
was
needed
to
meet
the
increased
cost
of
living
and
the
constantly
increasing
standard
of
living
among
the
educated
it
was
needed
by
the
cities
of
greece
and
the
east
to
repair
the
damages
done
in
the
wars
of
the
last
three
hundred
years
it
was
needed
by
the
poorer
provincials
to
pay
the
taxes
for
which
neither
the
publicani
nor
the
roman
government
could
afford
to
wait
and
it
was
needed
by
the
kings
who
had
come
within
the
dismal
shadow
of
the
roman
empire
in
order
to
carry
on
their
own
government
or
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
the
neighbouring
provincial
governor
or
to
bribe
the
ruling
men
at
rome
to
get
some
decree
passed
in
their
favour
cicero
at
the
end
of
his
life
looking
back
to
his
own
consulship
in
says
that
at
no
time
in
his
recollection
was
the
whole
world
in
such
a
condition
of
indebtedness
and
in
a
famous
passage
in
his
second
catilinarian
oration
he
has
drawn
a
picture
of
the
various
classes
of
debtors
in
rome
and
italy
at
that
time
ii
he
tells
us
of
those
who
have
wealth
and
yet
will
not
pay
their
debts
of
those
who
are
in
debt
and
look
to
a
revolution
to
absolve
them
of
the
veterans
of
the
sullan
army
settled
in
colonies
such
as
faesulae
who
had
rushed
into
debt
in
order
to
live
luxurious
lives
of
old
debtors
of
the
city
getting
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
quagmire
who
joined
the
conspiracy
as
a
last
desperate
venture
there
was
in
fact
in
that
famous
year
a
real
social
fermentation
going
on
caused
by
economic
disturbance
of
the
most
serious
kind
the
germs
of
the
disease
can
be
traced
back
to
the
hannibalic
war
and
its
effects
on
italy
but
all
the
symptoms
had
been
continually
exacerbated
by
the
negligence
and
ignorance
of
the
government
and
brought
to
a
head
by
the
social
and
civil
wars
in
in
the
state
escaped
an
economic
catastrophe
through
the
vigilance
of
cicero
and
the
alliance
of
the
respectable
classes
under
his
leadership
in
and
again
in
it
escaped
a
similar
disaster
through
the
good
sense
of
caesar
and
his
agents
who
succeeded
in
steering
between
scylla
and
charybdis
by
saving
the
debtors
without
ruining
the
lenders
wonderful
figures
are
given
by
later
writers
such
as
plutarch
of
the
debts
and
loans
of
the
great
men
of
this
time
and
they
may
stand
as
giving
us
a
general
impression
of
private
financial
recklessness
but
the
only
authentic
information
that
has
come
down
to
us
is
what
cicero
drops
from
time
to
time
in
his
correspondence
about
his
own
affairs
and
even
this
needs
much
explanation
which
we
are
unable
to
apply
to
it
what
is
certain
is
that
cicero
never
had
more
than
a
very
moderate
income
on
which
he
could
depend
and
that
at
times
he
was
hard
up
for
money
especially
of
course
after
his
exile
and
the
confiscation
of
his
property
and
that
on
the
other
hand
he
never
had
any
difficulty
in
getting
the
sums
he
needed
and
never
shows
the
smallest
real
anxiety
about
his
finances
his
profession
as
a
barrister
only
brought
him
a
return
indirectly
in
the
form
of
an
occasional
legacy
or
gift
since
fees
were
forbidden
by
a
lex
cincia
his
books
could
hardly
have
paid
him
at
least
in
the
form
of
money
his
inherited
property
was
small
and
his
italian
villas
were
not
profitable
farms
nor
was
it
the
practice
to
let
such
country
houses
as
we
do
now
when
not
occupying
them
he
declined
a
provincial
government
the
usual
source
of
wealth
and
when
at
last
compelled
to
undertake
one
only
realised
what
was
then
a
paltry
sum
some
all
of
which
while
in
deposit
at
ephesus
was
seized
by
the
pompeians
in
the
civil
war
yet
even
early
in
life
he
could
afford
the
necessary
expenses
for
election
to
successive
magistracies
and
could
live
in
the
style
demanded
of
an
important
public
man
immediately
after
his
consulship
he
paid
for
crassus
house
on
the
palatine
and
it
is
here
that
we
first
discover
how
he
managed
such
financial
operations
here
are
his
own
words
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
of
december
i
have
bought
the
house
for
sestertia
so
you
may
now
look
on
me
as
so
deeply
in
debt
as
to
be
eager
to
join
a
conspiracy
if
any
one
would
admit
me
money
is
plentiful
at
per
cent
and
the
success
of
my
measures
in
the
consulship
has
caused
me
to
be
regarded
as
a
good
security
the
simple
fact
was
that
cicero
was
always
regarded
as
a
safe
man
to
lend
money
to
by
the
business
men
and
the
great
capitalists
partly
because
he
was
an
honest
man
a
who
would
never
dream
of
repudiation
or
bankruptcy
partly
because
he
knew
every
one
and
had
a
hundred
wealthy
friends
besides
the
lender
of
the
moment
and
among
them
most
faithful
of
all
the
prudent
and
indefatigable
atticus
undoubtedly
then
it
was
by
borrowing
and
regularly
paying
interest
on
the
loans
that
he
raised
money
whenever
he
wanted
it
he
may
have
occasionally
made
money
in
the
companies
of
we
have
seen
that
he
probably
had
shares
in
some
of
their
ventures
but
there
is
no
clear
evidence
in
his
letters
of
this
source
of
wealth
and
there
is
abundant
evidence
of
the
borrowing
after
his
return
from
exile
though
the
senate
had
given
him
somewhat
meagre
compensation
for
the
loss
of
his
property
he
began
at
once
to
borrow
and
to
build
i
am
building
in
three
places
he
writes
to
his
brother
and
am
patching
up
my
other
houses
i
live
somewhat
more
lavishly
than
i
used
to
do
i
am
obliged
to
do
so
here
again
we
know
from
whom
he
borrowed
it
was
this
same
brother
who
of
course
had
no
more
certain
income
than
his
own
probably
less
but
he
had
been
governor
of
asia
for
three
years
and
must
have
realised
large
sums
even
in
that
exhausted
province
and
at
this
moment
he
was
legatus
to
pompeius
as
special
commissioner
for
organising
the
supply
of
corn
and
thus
was
in
immediate
contact
with
one
of
the
greatest
millionaires
of
the
day
in
order
to
repay
his
brother
all
marcus
had
to
do
was
to
borrow
from
other
friends
in
regard
to
money
i
am
crippled
but
the
liberality
of
my
brother
i
have
repaid
in
spite
of
his
protests
by
the
aid
of
my
friends
that
i
might
not
be
drained
quite
dry
myself
iv
two
years
later
an
unwary
reader
might
feel
some
astonishment
at
finding
that
quintus
himself
was
now
deep
in
debt
but
as
he
continues
to
read
the
correspondence
his
astonishment
will
vanish
with
the
prospect
before
him
of
a
prolonged
stay
in
gaul
with
caesar
quintus
might
doubtless
have
borrowed
to
any
extent
and
in
fact
with
caesar
help
the
proceeds
of
the
gallic
wars
both
brothers
found
themselves
in
opulence
the
civil
war
and
the
repayment
of
his
debts
to
caesar
nearly
ruined
marcus
towards
the
end
of
his
life
but
nothing
prevented
his
contriving
to
find
money
for
any
object
on
which
he
had
set
his
heart
when
in
his
grief
for
the
loss
of
his
daughter
he
wishes
to
buy
suburban
gardens
where
a
shrine
to
her
memory
may
strange
to
say
attract
public
notice
he
tells
atticus
to
buy
what
is
necessary
any
manage
the
business
your
own
way
do
not
consider
what
my
purse
demands
about
that
i
care
nothing
but
what
i
such
being
the
financial
method
of
cicero
and
his
brother
we
can
not
be
surprised
to
find
that
the
younger
generation
of
the
family
followed
faithfully
in
the
footsteps
of
their
elders
we
have
seen
that
the
young
marcus
had
a
large
allowance
at
athens
and
on
the
whole
he
seems
to
have
kept
fairly
well
within
it
in
spite
of
some
trouble
but
his
cousin
the
younger
quintus
coming
to
see
his
uncle
in
december
showed
him
a
gloomy
countenance
and
on
being
asked
the
meaning
of
it
said
that
he
was
going
with
caesar
to
the
parthian
war
in
order
to
avoid
his
creditors
and
presumably
to
make
money
to
pay
them
with
he
had
not
even
enough
money
for
the
journey
out
his
uncle
did
not
offer
to
give
him
any
but
he
does
not
seem
to
have
thought
very
seriously
of
the
young
man
embarrassments
one
more
example
of
the
financial
dealings
of
the
business
men
of
this
extraordinary
age
and
we
will
bring
this
chapter
to
an
end
it
is
a
story
which
has
luckily
been
preserved
in
cicero
speech
in
defence
of
a
certain
rabirius
postumus
in
the
year
who
was
accused
under
caesar
law
de
pecuniis
repetundis
extortion
in
the
provinces
it
is
a
remarkable
revelation
of
all
the
most
striking
methods
of
making
and
using
money
in
the
last
years
of
the
republic
the
father
of
this
rabirius
says
cicero
had
been
a
distinguished
member
of
the
equestrian
order
and
fortissimus
et
maximus
publicanus
not
greedy
of
money
but
most
liberal
to
his
friends
in
other
words
he
was
not
a
miser
for
that
character
was
rare
in
this
age
but
lent
his
money
freely
in
order
to
acquire
influence
and
consideration
the
son
took
up
the
same
line
of
business
and
engaged
in
a
wide
sphere
of
financial
operations
he
dealt
largely
in
the
stock
of
the
he
lent
money
to
cities
in
several
provinces
he
lent
money
to
ptolemy
auletes
king
of
egypt
both
before
he
was
expelled
from
his
kingdom
by
sedition
and
afterwards
when
he
was
in
rome
in
and
intriguing
to
induce
the
senate
to
have
him
restored
rabirius
never
doubted
that
he
would
be
so
restored
and
seems
to
have
failed
to
see
the
probability
of
such
a
policy
being
contested
or
quarrelled
about
as
actually
happened
in
the
winter
of
he
lent
and
persuaded
his
friends
to
lend
he
represented
the
king
cause
as
a
good
investment
and
then
like
the
investing
agent
of
who
slips
so
easily
from
carelessness
into
crime
he
had
to
go
on
lending
more
and
more
because
he
feared
that
if
he
stopped
the
king
might
turn
against
him
he
had
staked
the
mass
of
his
substance
on
a
desperate
venture
but
time
went
on
and
ptolemy
was
not
restored
and
without
the
revenues
of
his
kingdom
he
of
course
could
not
pay
his
creditors
at
last
at
the
end
of
the
year
gabinius
then
governor
of
syria
had
pressure
put
on
him
by
the
creditors
among
them
perhaps
both
caesar
and
pompeius
to
march
into
egypt
without
the
authority
of
the
senate
he
took
rabirius
with
him
and
in
order
to
secure
the
repayment
the
latter
was
made
superintendent
dioikaetaes
of
the
egyptian
revenues
unluckily
for
him
his
wily
debtor
did
after
all
turn
against
him
and
he
escaped
from
egypt
with
difficulty
and
with
the
loss
of
all
his
wealth
when
gabinius
was
accused
de
repetundis
and
found
guilty
of
accepting
enormous
sums
from
ptolemy
rabirius
was
involved
in
the
same
prosecution
as
having
received
part
of
the
money
cicero
defended
him
and
as
it
seems
with
success
on
the
plea
that
equites
were
not
liable
to
prosecution
under
the
lex
julia
towards
the
end
of
his
speech
he
drew
a
clever
picture
of
his
unlucky
misfortunes
and
declared
that
he
would
have
had
to
quit
the
forum
to
leave
the
stock
exchange
in
disgrace
if
caesar
had
not
come
to
his
rescue
by
placing
large
sums
at
his
disposal
what
rabirius
did
was
simply
to
gamble
on
a
gigantic
scale
and
get
others
to
gamble
with
him
the
luck
turned
against
him
and
he
came
utterly
to
grief
there
seems
indeed
to
have
been
a
perfect
passion
for
dealing
with
money
in
this
wild
way
among
the
men
of
wealth
and
influence
it
was
the
fancy
of
the
hour
and
no
disgrace
attached
to
it
if
a
man
could
escape
ruin
thus
the
vast
capital
accumulated
the
sources
of
which
were
almost
entirely
in
the
provinces
and
the
kingdoms
on
the
frontiers
was
hardly
ever
used
productively
it
never
returned
to
the
region
whence
it
came
to
be
used
in
developing
its
resources
the
idea
of
using
it
even
in
italy
for
industrial
undertakings
was
absent
from
the
mind
of
the
gambler
those
numberless
villas
of
which
we
shall
speak
in
another
chapter
were
homes
of
luxury
and
magnificence
not
centres
of
agricultural
industry
there
are
indeed
some
signs
that
in
this
very
generation
the
revival
of
italian
agriculture
was
beginning
and
more
especially
the
cultivation
of
the
olive
and
the
vine
varro
some
twenty
years
later
could
claim
that
italy
was
the
best
cultivated
country
in
the
world
it
may
be
that
the
din
of
the
insanum
forum
and
its
wild
speculation
has
prevented
our
hearing
of
the
quiet
efforts
in
the
country
to
put
capital
to
a
legitimate
productive
use
but
of
the
social
life
of
the
city
the
forum
was
the
heart
and
of
any
prudent
or
scientific
use
of
capital
the
forum
knew
hardly
anything
of
the
two
classes
of
business
men
we
have
been
describing
the
and
the
it
is
hard
to
say
which
wrought
the
most
mischief
in
the
empire
they
played
into
each
other
hands
in
wringing
money
out
of
the
helpless
provincials
together
too
they
did
incalculable
harm
morally
and
socially
among
the
upper
strata
of
roman
society
at
home
economic
maladies
react
upon
the
mental
and
moral
condition
of
a
state
where
the
idea
of
making
money
for
its
own
sake
or
merely
for
the
sake
of
the
pleasure
derivable
from
excitement
is
paramount
in
the
minds
of
so
large
a
section
of
society
moral
perception
quickly
becomes
warped
the
sense
of
justice
disappears
because
when
the
fever
is
on
a
man
he
does
not
stop
to
ask
whether
his
gains
are
and
in
this
age
the
only
restriction
on
the
plundering
of
the
subjects
of
the
empire
was
a
legal
one
and
that
of
no
great
efficacy
there
are
many
repulsive
things
in
the
exquisite
poetry
of
catullus
but
none
of
them
jar
on
the
modern
mind
quite
so
sharply
as
his
virulent
attacks
on
a
provincial
governor
in
whose
suite
he
had
gone
to
bithynia
in
the
hope
of
enriching
himself
and
under
whose
just
administration
he
had
failed
to
do
so
there
is
lost
also
the
sense
of
a
duty
arising
out
of
the
possession
of
wealth
the
feeling
that
it
should
do
some
good
in
the
world
or
at
least
be
in
part
applied
to
some
useful
purpose
lastly
the
exciting
pursuit
of
wealth
helps
to
produce
a
curious
restlessness
and
instability
of
character
of
which
we
have
many
examples
in
the
age
we
are
studying
unstable
as
water
thou
shalt
not
excel
are
words
that
might
be
applied
to
many
a
young
man
among
cicero
acquaintance
and
to
many
women
also
no
sudden
operation
could
cure
these
evils
they
needed
the
careful
and
gradual
treatment
of
a
wise
physician
as
in
so
many
other
ways
so
here
augustus
showed
his
wonderful
instinct
as
a
social
reformer
the
first
requisite
of
all
was
an
age
of
comparative
peace
a
healthy
atmosphere
in
which
the
patient
could
recover
his
natural
tone
next
in
importance
was
the
removal
of
the
incitement
to
enrich
yourself
and
to
spend
illegally
or
unprofitably
and
the
revival
of
a
sense
of
duty
towards
the
state
and
its
rulers
provincial
governors
were
made
more
really
responsible
and
a
scientific
census
revealed
the
actual
capacity
of
the
provincials
was
more
closely
superintended
and
gradually
disappeared
it
is
true
enough
that
even
under
the
empire
great
fortunes
were
made
and
lost
but
the
gambling
spirit
the
wild
recklessness
in
monetary
dealings
are
not
met
with
again
the
roman
forum
ceased
to
be
insane
and
italy
became
once
more
the
home
of
much
happy
and
useful
country
life
the
passionate
and
reckless
of
catullus
is
succeeded
in
the
next
generation
by
the
calm
sweet
hopefulness
of
virgil
in
passing
from
the
one
poet
to
the
other
we
feel
that
we
are
leaving
behind
us
an
age
of
and
entering
on
one
in
which
duty
and
honour
labour
on
the
land
and
hard
work
for
the
state
may
be
reckoned
as
things
more
likely
to
make
life
worth
living
than
all
the
accumulated
capital
of
a
crassus
chapter
iv
the
governing
aristocracy
above
the
men
of
business
of
equestrian
rank
in
social
standing
though
not
necessarily
in
wealth
there
was
in
cicero
time
an
aristocracy
which
a
roman
of
that
day
would
perhaps
have
found
it
a
little
difficult
to
explain
or
define
to
a
foreigner
fortunately
all
foreigners
coming
to
rome
would
know
what
was
meant
by
the
senate
the
great
council
which
received
envoys
from
all
nations
outside
the
empire
and
the
stranger
might
be
told
in
the
first
place
that
all
members
of
that
august
assembly
with
their
families
were
considered
as
elevated
above
the
equestrian
order
and
as
forming
the
main
body
of
the
aristocracy
proper
but
if
the
informant
were
by
chance
a
conservative
roman
of
old
family
he
might
proceed
to
qualify
this
definition
there
are
now
in
the
senate
he
might
say
plenty
of
men
who
are
only
there
because
they
have
held
the
quaestorship
which
sulla
made
the
qualification
for
a
seat
and
there
are
many
equites
whom
sulla
made
into
senators
by
the
form
of
a
vote
of
the
people
such
men
even
the
great
orator
cicero
himself
i
do
not
reckon
as
really
members
of
the
nobility
because
they
do
not
belong
to
old
families
who
have
done
the
state
good
service
in
past
time
they
have
no
images
of
their
ancestors
in
their
houses
they
come
from
municipal
towns
or
spring
from
some
low
family
in
the
city
they
may
have
raised
themselves
by
their
talents
perhaps
only
by
their
money
but
they
have
no
guarantee
of
antiquity
their
names
are
not
in
our
annals
all
we
true
conservative
romans
and
a
roman
is
hardly
a
roman
if
not
conservative
profoundly
believe
that
a
man
whose
family
has
once
attained
to
high
public
honour
and
done
good
public
service
will
be
a
safer
person
to
elect
as
a
magistrate
than
one
whose
family
is
unknown
and
untried
a
belief
which
is
surely
based
on
a
truth
of
human
nature
i
should
count
a
man
who
happens
not
to
be
in
the
senate
himself
for
want
of
wealth
or
inclination
but
whose
family
has
its
images
and
its
traditions
of
great
ancestors
as
far
more
truly
an
optimate
than
most
of
these
new
men
fortunately
our
most
famous
families
whose
names
are
known
all
over
the
empire
are
still
to
be
found
in
the
senate
and
indeed
form
a
powerful
body
there
capable
of
resisting
to
the
last
the
revolutionary
dangers
that
threaten
us
the
people
still
elect
to
magistracies
the
aemilii
lutatii
claudii
cornelii
julii
and
many
more
families
that
have
been
famous
in
our
history
and
will
i
trust
continue
to
elect
them
so
long
as
our
republic
lasts
there
was
indeed
a
glamour
about
these
splendid
names
as
there
is
about
the
titles
of
our
ancient
noble
families
their
holders
may
almost
be
said
to
have
claimed
high
office
as
a
right
like
the
whig
families
of
the
revolution
for
a
century
after
their
triumph
though
we
may
use
the
word
in
a
wider
sense
in
this
chapter
these
grand
old
families
were
the
true
aristocracy
and
inspired
just
that
respect
in
the
minds
of
men
outside
their
circle
which
is
still
so
familiar
to
us
in
england
cicero
was
to
such
men
an
outsider
a
and
the
close
reader
of
cicero
letters
if
he
is
looking
out
as
he
should
be
for
cicero
constantly
changing
attitude
of
mind
as
he
addresses
himself
to
various
correspondents
can
not
fail
to
see
how
comparatively
awkward
and
stilted
he
often
is
when
writing
to
one
of
these
great
nobles
with
whom
he
has
never
been
really
intimate
and
how
easily
his
pen
glides
along
when
he
is
letting
himself
talk
to
atticus
or
poetus
or
marius
men
who
were
outside
the
pale
of
nobility
it
is
true
that
he
is
sometimes
embarrassed
in
other
ways
when
writing
to
great
personages
as
for
example
lentulus
spinther
consul
in
or
to
appius
claudius
consul
in
but
had
they
been
men
of
his
own
kind
he
never
would
have
felt
that
embarrassment
in
the
same
degree
when
writing
to
such
men
he
rarely
or
never
indulges
in
those
little
sportive
jokes
or
allusions
which
enliven
his
more
intimate
correspondence
nor
does
he
tell
the
truth
so
strictly
for
they
might
not
always
care
to
hear
it
here
is
a
specimen
which
will
give
some
idea
of
his
manner
in
writing
to
an
aristocrat
he
is
congratulating
aemilius
paullus
who
secured
his
election
to
the
consulship
in
the
summer
of
though
i
never
doubted
that
the
roman
people
considering
your
eminent
services
to
the
republic
and
splendid
position
of
your
would
enthusiastically
elect
you
consul
by
a
unanimous
vote
yet
i
felt
extreme
delight
when
the
news
reached
me
and
i
pray
the
gods
to
render
your
official
career
fortunate
and
to
make
the
administration
of
your
office
worthy
of
your
own
position
and
of
your
and
would
that
it
had
been
in
my
power
to
have
been
at
home
to
see
that
day
and
to
have
given
you
the
support
which
your
noble
services
and
kindness
to
me
deserved
but
since
the
unexpected
and
accident
of
my
having
to
take
a
province
has
deprived
me
of
that
opportunity
yet
that
i
may
be
enabled
to
see
you
as
consul
actually
administering
the
state
in
a
manner
worthy
of
your
position
i
earnestly
beg
you
to
take
care
to
prevent
my
being
treated
unfairly
or
having
additional
time
added
to
my
year
of
office
if
you
do
that
you
will
abundantly
crown
your
former
acts
of
kindness
to
me
this
aemilius
paullus
like
spinther
and
many
others
belonged
to
a
respectable
but
somewhat
characterless
type
of
aristocrat
these
formed
a
considerable
and
a
powerful
section
of
the
senate
where
they
were
an
obstacle
to
reform
and
administrative
efficiency
they
were
really
a
survival
from
the
old
type
of
roman
noble
which
had
done
excellent
work
in
its
day
men
in
whom
the
individual
had
been
kept
in
strict
subordination
to
the
state
and
whose
personal
idiosyncrasies
and
ambitions
only
excited
suspicion
but
towards
the
end
of
the
republican
period
the
individual
had
free
play
at
no
time
in
ancient
history
do
we
meet
with
so
many
various
and
interesting
kinds
of
individuality
even
among
the
nobilitas
itself
this
is
not
merely
the
result
of
the
abundant
literature
in
which
their
traits
have
come
down
to
us
it
was
a
fact
of
the
age
in
which
the
idea
of
the
state
had
fallen
into
the
background
and
the
individual
found
no
restraint
on
his
thoughts
and
little
on
his
actions
no
hindrance
to
the
development
of
his
capacity
either
for
good
or
evil
sulla
catiline
pompeius
cato
clodius
caesar
all
have
their
marked
characteristics
familiar
to
all
who
read
the
history
of
the
roman
revolution
caesar
is
the
most
remarkable
example
of
strong
character
among
the
men
of
high
aristocratic
descent
and
it
is
interesting
to
notice
how
entirely
he
was
without
the
exclusive
tendency
which
we
associate
with
aristocrats
he
was
intimate
with
men
of
all
ranks
his
closest
friends
seem
to
have
been
men
who
were
noble
while
the
high
aristocrats
looked
down
as
a
rule
on
cicero
the
novus
homo
and
for
some
years
positively
hated
him
caesar
though
differing
from
him
in
politics
was
always
on
pleasant
terms
of
personal
intercourse
with
him
he
had
a
charm
of
manner
a
literary
taste
and
a
genuine
admiration
for
genius
which
was
invariably
irresistible
to
the
sensitive
novus
homo
with
pompey
though
he
trusted
him
politically
as
he
never
trusted
caesar
cicero
was
never
so
intimate
they
had
not
the
same
common
interests
cicero
could
laugh
at
pompey
behind
his
back
but
hardly
once
in
his
correspondence
does
he
attempt
to
raise
a
jest
about
caesar
thus
in
the
governing
or
senatorial
aristocracy
we
find
men
of
a
great
variety
of
character
from
the
nobilis
exclusive
in
society
and
obstructive
in
politics
to
the
man
of
individual
genius
and
literary
ability
whether
of
blue
blood
like
caesar
or
like
cicero
the
scion
of
a
municipal
family
which
has
never
gained
or
sought
political
distinction
but
for
the
purposes
of
this
chapter
we
may
discern
and
discuss
two
main
types
of
character
in
this
aristocracy
first
that
on
which
the
new
greek
culture
had
worked
to
advantage
not
destroying
the
best
roman
qualities
but
drawing
them
into
usefulness
in
new
ways
secondly
that
on
which
the
same
culture
had
worked
to
its
harm
by
taking
advantage
of
weak
points
in
the
roman
armour
sapping
the
true
roman
quality
without
substituting
any
other
excellence
we
will
briefly
trace
the
growth
of
these
two
types
and
take
an
example
of
each
among
cicero
intimate
friends
not
from
the
famous
personages
familiar
to
every
one
but
from
eminent
and
interesting
men
of
whom
the
ordinary
student
knows
comparatively
little
ever
since
the
hannibalic
war
and
probably
even
before
it
roman
nobles
had
felt
the
power
of
greek
culture
they
had
begun
to
think
to
learn
about
peoples
who
were
different
from
themselves
in
habits
and
manners
and
to
advance
the
best
of
them
at
least
in
wisdom
and
knowledge
and
this
is
true
in
spite
of
the
unquestioned
fact
that
it
was
in
this
same
era
that
the
seeds
were
sown
of
moral
and
political
degeneracy
we
shall
have
abundant
opportunity
of
noting
the
effects
of
this
degeneracy
in
the
last
age
of
the
republic
but
it
is
pleasant
to
dwell
for
a
moment
on
that
more
wholesome
greek
influence
which
enticed
the
finer
minds
among
the
roman
nobility
into
a
new
region
of
culture
stimulating
thought
and
strengthening
the
springs
of
conduct
even
the
old
cato
himself
most
rigid
of
roman
conservatives
was
not
unmoved
by
this
influence
and
it
was
to
him
that
rome
owed
the
introduction
of
ennius
the
greatest
literary
figure
of
that
age
into
roman
society
but
the
first
genuine
example
of
the
new
culture
of
the
hellenic
enthusiasm
of
the
age
is
to
be
found
in
aemilius
paullus
the
conqueror
of
macedonia
a
true
roman
aristocrat
who
was
delighted
to
learn
from
greeks
plutarch
of
this
man
is
a
valuable
record
of
the
tendencies
of
the
time
after
his
failure
to
obtain
a
second
consulship
plutarch
tells
us
that
he
retired
into
private
life
devoting
himself
to
religious
duties
and
to
the
education
of
his
children
training
these
in
the
old
roman
habits
in
which
he
had
himself
been
trained
but
also
in
greek
culture
and
that
with
even
greater
enthusiasm
he
had
about
them
greek
teachers
not
only
of
grammar
rhetoric
and
philosophy
but
of
the
fine
arts
and
even
of
pursuits
such
as
hunting
to
which
the
romans
were
not
greatly
addicted
and
of
the
care
of
horses
and
dogs
and
he
made
a
point
of
being
present
himself
at
all
their
exercises
bodily
and
mental
the
result
of
this
wholesome
xenophontic
education
is
seen
in
his
son
the
great
scipio
aemilianus
who
was
adopted
into
the
family
of
the
scipios
in
the
lifetime
of
his
father
whatever
view
we
may
take
of
this
great
man
conduct
in
war
and
politics
there
can
hardly
be
a
doubt
that
the
romans
themselves
were
right
in
treasuring
his
memory
as
one
of
the
best
of
their
race
when
we
put
all
the
facts
of
his
life
together
from
his
early
youth
of
which
his
friend
polybius
has
left
us
a
most
beautiful
picture
to
his
sudden
and
probably
violent
death
in
the
maturity
of
his
powers
we
are
compelled
to
believe
that
he
was
really
a
man
of
wide
sympathies
a
strong
sense
of
justice
which
guided
him
steadily
through
good
report
and
ill
perfect
purity
of
life
and
hatred
of
all
that
was
low
and
bad
whether
in
rich
or
poor
he
was
not
like
his
father
a
roman
aristocrat
patronising
greek
culture
in
him
we
see
a
perfectly
natural
and
mature
combination
of
the
noblest
qualities
of
the
roman
and
the
wholesomest
qualities
of
the
greek
it
was
an
awakening
truth
says
a
great
authority
in
the
minds
of
romans
like
scipio
that
intellectual
culture
must
be
built
upon
a
foundation
of
moral
rectitude
and
such
a
foundation
they
could
find
in
the
storehouse
of
their
own
domestic
traditions
when
cicero
who
held
him
to
be
the
greatest
of
romans
wrote
his
dialogue
on
the
state
with
the
new
idea
pervading
it
of
the
moral
and
political
ascendancy
of
a
single
man
he
made
scipio
the
hero
and
the
one
ascendant
figure
in
his
work
and
ended
it
with
an
imitation
of
the
platonic
myth
in
the
form
of
a
dream
of
scipio
scipio
gathered
round
him
a
circle
of
able
and
cultured
men
both
roman
and
greek
including
almost
every
living
roman
of
ability
and
among
the
greeks
the
historian
polybius
and
the
philosopher
panaetius
of
whom
we
shall
have
more
to
learn
in
the
course
of
this
volume
of
this
circle
the
best
and
ablest
men
of
cicero
earlier
days
were
mentally
the
children
and
his
own
views
both
of
literature
and
politics
were
largely
formed
upon
the
scipionic
tradition
indeed
to
understand
the
mental
and
moral
furniture
of
the
roman
mind
in
the
ciceronian
age
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
study
that
of
the
generation
which
made
that
mind
what
it
was
but
here
space
can
only
be
found
to
point
out
how
the
enlightenment
of
the
scipionic
circle
opened
out
new
ways
in
manners
in
literature
in
philosophical
receptivity
and
lastly
in
the
study
of
the
law
which
was
destined
to
be
rome
greatest
contribution
to
civilisation
manners
the
demeanour
of
the
individual
in
social
intercourse
are
a
valuable
index
if
not
an
entirely
conclusive
one
of
the
mental
and
moral
tone
of
society
in
any
age
ease
and
courteousness
of
bearing
mean
as
a
rule
that
the
sense
of
another
claims
as
a
human
being
are
always
present
to
the
mind
whatever
be
the
shortcomings
of
the
last
age
of
the
republic
we
must
give
due
credit
to
the
fact
that
in
their
outward
demeanour
towards
each
other
the
educated
men
of
that
age
almost
invariably
show
good
breeding
it
is
true
enough
that
public
vituperation
in
senate
or
was
a
fact
of
every
day
and
the
wealth
of
violent
personal
abuse
which
a
gentleman
like
cicero
could
expend
on
one
whom
for
the
time
he
hated
or
who
had
done
him
some
wrong
passes
all
belief
but
the
history
of
this
vituperation
is
a
curious
one
it
was
a
traditional
method
of
hostile
oratory
and
sprang
from
an
old
roman
root
the
tendency
to
defamation
and
satire
which
may
itself
be
attributed
in
part
to
the
italian
custom
of
levelling
abuse
at
a
public
man
at
his
triumph
in
order
to
avert
evil
from
him
to
single
out
a
man
personal
ugliness
to
calumniate
his
ancestry
in
the
vilest
terms
these
were
little
more
than
traditional
practices
oratorical
devices
which
the
rhetorical
education
of
the
day
encouraged
and
which
no
one
took
very
seriously
but
we
are
concerned
in
this
chapter
mainly
with
private
life
and
there
we
find
almost
universal
consideration
and
courtesy
in
the
whole
of
the
ciceronian
correspondence
there
is
hardly
a
letter
that
does
not
show
good
breeding
and
there
are
many
that
are
the
natural
result
of
real
kindly
feeling
and
true
sympathy
a
good
example
of
the
best
type
of
roman
manners
is
to
be
found
in
plutarch
of
gaius
gracchus
the
younger
contemporary
of
scipio
who
had
married
his
sister
plutarch
draws
a
picture
of
him
so
vivid
that
by
common
consent
it
is
ascribed
to
the
memoirs
of
some
one
who
knew
him
in
all
his
dealings
with
men
says
the
biographer
he
was
always
dignified
yet
always
courteous
that
is
while
he
inspired
respect
men
felt
also
that
he
would
do
anything
in
his
power
for
them
that
this
was
said
of
him
by
a
roman
and
not
invented
for
him
by
plutarch
seems
probable
because
the
combination
is
one
peculiarly
roman
so
livy
when
he
wishes
to
describe
the
finest
type
of
roman
character
says
that
a
certain
man
was
haud
minus
libertatis
alienae
quam
suae
dignitatis
memor
this
same
combination
meets
us
also
in
the
little
pictures
of
the
social
life
of
cultivated
men
which
cicero
has
left
us
in
some
of
his
dialogues
there
the
speakers
are
usually
of
the
nobility
often
distinguished
members
of
senatorial
families
as
in
the
where
the
chief
are
crassus
antonius
and
scaevola
the
conservative
triumvirate
of
the
day
they
all
seem
grave
or
but
seldom
gently
jocular
respectful
to
each
other
and
perhaps
a
trifle
tedious
they
never
quarrel
however
deeply
they
may
differ
and
we
may
guess
that
they
did
not
hold
their
opinions
strongly
enough
to
urge
them
to
open
rupture
we
seem
to
see
the
same
grave
faces
with
rather
noses
and
large
mouths
which
meet
us
in
the
sculptures
of
augustus
ara
pacis
full
of
dignity
but
a
little
wanting
in
animation
there
is
one
singular
exception
to
the
good
manners
of
the
period
but
as
the
result
rather
of
affectation
than
of
nature
it
may
help
to
prove
our
rule
again
and
again
in
plutarch
of
cato
the
younger
the
mention
of
his
rudeness
proves
the
strength
of
the
tradition
about
him
it
was
said
that
this
lost
him
the
consulship
as
he
declined
to
make
himself
agreeable
in
the
style
expected
from
candidates
even
in
a
letter
to
cicero
an
old
friend
though
not
actually
rude
he
is
absurdly
patronising
and
impertinent
to
a
man
many
years
his
senior
and
writes
in
very
bad
taste
probably
the
enmity
between
him
and
caesar
arose
or
was
confirmed
in
this
way
as
cato
always
made
a
point
of
being
rudest
to
those
whom
he
most
disliked
he
fancied
that
he
was
imitating
his
great
ancestor
and
asserting
the
virtue
of
good
old
roman
bluntness
against
modern
greek
affectation
he
did
not
in
the
least
see
that
he
was
himself
a
curious
example
of
roman
affectation
shown
up
by
the
real
amenities
of
intercourse
for
which
romans
had
largely
to
thank
greece
in
literature
too
the
average
capacity
of
this
aristocracy
was
high
though
the
greatest
literary
figures
of
the
age
if
we
except
caesar
do
not
strictly
speaking
belong
to
it
cicero
was
a
novus
homo
and
lucretius
and
catullus
were
not
of
the
senatorial
order
but
the
new
education
as
we
shall
see
later
on
was
admirably
calculated
to
train
men
in
the
art
of
speaking
and
writing
if
not
in
the
habit
of
independent
thinking
and
among
the
nobles
who
reaped
the
full
fruits
of
this
education
every
one
could
write
in
latin
and
probably
also
in
greek
and
if
he
aimed
at
public
distinction
could
speak
without
disgracing
himself
in
the
senate
and
the
courts
oratory
was
in
fact
the
staple
product
of
the
age
and
the
chief
of
its
literary
activity
long
ago
the
practice
had
begun
of
writing
out
successful
speeches
delivered
in
the
senate
in
the
courts
or
at
funerals
the
means
of
publication
were
easy
as
a
consequence
of
the
number
of
greek
slaves
who
could
act
as
copyists
and
thus
oratory
formed
the
basis
of
a
prose
literature
which
is
essentially
roman
rooted
in
the
practical
necessities
of
the
life
of
the
roman
noble
though
deeply
tinged
with
the
greek
ideas
and
forms
of
expression
acquired
in
the
process
of
education
in
vogue
treatises
on
rhetoric
the
art
of
effective
expression
in
prose
form
an
important
part
of
it
two
of
them
still
survive
from
the
time
of
sulla
the
ad
of
an
unknown
author
and
cicero
early
treatise
later
on
cicero
wrote
his
admirable
dialogue
and
other
works
on
the
same
subject
ending
with
his
a
catalogue
raisonn√©e
invaluable
to
us
of
all
the
great
roman
orators
down
to
his
own
time
in
history
writing
the
standard
was
not
so
high
the
rhetorical
education
made
men
good
professional
orators
but
indifferent
and
dilettante
historians
and
the
example
of
more
accurate
historical
investigation
and
reflection
set
by
polybius
was
not
followed
except
perhaps
by
caelius
antipater
in
the
gracchan
age
history
was
affected
for
the
worse
by
the
rhetorical
art
as
indeed
poetry
was
destined
also
to
be
sallust
though
we
owe
much
to
him
was
in
fact
an
amateur
who
thought
more
of
style
and
expression
than
of
truth
and
fact
caesar
who
did
not
profess
to
be
a
historian
but
only
to
provide
the
materials
for
history
stands
alone
in
making
facts
more
important
than
words
and
rarely
troubles
his
reader
with
speeches
or
other
rhetorical
superfluities
biographies
and
autobiographies
were
fashionable
of
the
former
only
those
of
cornelius
nepos
one
of
cicero
many
friends
have
come
down
to
us
and
none
of
the
latter
but
we
know
a
long
list
of
eminent
men
who
wrote
their
own
memoirs
including
catulus
the
elder
rutilius
the
famous
victim
of
equestrian
judges
sulla
and
lucullus
but
far
above
all
other
prose
writers
of
the
age
stand
two
men
neither
of
them
roman
by
birth
but
yet
members
of
the
senatorial
order
the
one
a
man
of
encyclopaedic
learning
with
what
we
may
almost
call
a
scientific
interest
in
the
subjects
which
he
treated
in
awkward
and
homely
latin
the
other
a
man
of
comparatively
little
learning
but
gifted
with
so
exquisite
a
sense
of
the
beautiful
in
expression
and
at
the
same
time
with
a
humanity
so
real
and
in
that
day
so
rare
that
it
is
not
without
good
cause
that
he
has
recently
been
called
the
most
highly
cultured
man
of
all
antiquity
of
varro
numerous
works
we
have
unluckily
but
few
survivals
of
cicero
we
have
still
such
a
mass
as
will
for
ever
provide
ample
material
for
studying
the
life
the
manners
the
thought
of
his
day
a
large
part
of
this
mass
consists
of
the
correspondence
of
which
we
are
making
such
frequent
use
in
these
chapters
is
perhaps
the
most
pleasing
and
genuine
of
all
the
literary
activities
of
the
time
men
took
pains
to
write
well
yet
not
with
any
definite
prospect
of
publication
such
as
was
the
motive
a
century
later
in
the
days
of
seneca
and
pliny
the
nine
hundred
and
odd
letters
of
the
ciceronian
collection
are
most
of
them
neither
mere
communications
nor
yet
rhetorical
exercises
but
real
letters
the
intercourse
of
intimate
friends
at
a
distance
in
which
their
inmost
thoughts
can
often
be
seen
cicero
is
indeed
apt
to
become
rhetorical
even
in
his
letters
when
writing
under
excitement
about
politics
but
the
most
delightful
letters
in
the
collection
are
those
in
which
he
writes
to
his
friends
in
happy
and
natural
language
of
his
daily
life
and
occupations
his
books
his
villas
his
children
his
joys
and
sorrows
it
is
strange
that
the
great
historian
of
rome
in
our
time
entirely
failed
to
see
the
charm
and
the
value
of
these
letters
as
of
all
cicero
writings
his
countrymen
have
now
agreed
to
differ
from
him
and
to
restore
a
great
writer
to
his
true
position
in
philosophical
receptivity
too
the
brightest
and
finest
minds
among
this
aristocracy
show
an
ability
which
is
almost
astonishing
when
we
consider
that
there
had
been
no
education
in
rome
worth
the
name
until
the
second
century
i
use
the
word
receptivity
because
the
romans
of
our
period
never
really
learnt
to
think
for
themselves
they
never
grappled
with
a
problem
or
struck
out
a
new
line
of
thought
but
so
far
as
we
can
judge
by
cicero
philosophical
works
the
only
ones
of
his
age
which
have
come
down
to
us
the
power
to
read
with
understanding
and
to
reproduce
with
skill
was
unquestionably
of
a
high
order
the
opportunities
for
study
were
not
wanting
private
libraries
were
numerous
and
all
cicero
friends
who
had
collected
books
were
glad
to
let
him
have
the
use
of
them
greek
philosophers
were
often
domesticated
in
wealthy
families
and
could
discourse
with
the
statesman
when
he
had
leisure
from
public
business
much
of
this
was
no
more
than
fashion
and
real
endeavour
and
earnestness
were
rare
but
the
fact
remains
that
one
philosophical
system
more
especially
on
its
ethical
side
took
real
possession
of
the
best
type
of
roman
mind
and
had
permanent
and
saving
influence
on
it
stoicism
was
brought
to
rome
by
panaetius
of
rhodes
the
intimate
friend
of
scipio
a
mild
and
tactful
greek
whose
rhodian
birth
gave
him
perhaps
some
advantage
in
associating
with
the
old
allies
of
his
state
he
came
to
rome
at
a
critical
moment
when
even
the
best
men
were
drifting
into
pure
material
and
the
results
of
his
teaching
were
during
two
centuries
so
wholesome
and
inspiring
that
we
may
almost
think
of
him
as
a
missionary
the
ground
had
been
prepared
for
him
in
some
sense
by
polybius
who
introduced
him
to
scipio
and
his
circle
and
who
was
then
engaged
in
writing
his
history
from
polybius
the
romans
the
best
of
them
at
least
first
learnt
to
realise
their
own
empire
and
the
great
change
it
had
wrought
in
the
world
to
think
about
what
they
had
done
and
the
qualities
that
enabled
them
to
do
it
from
panaetius
they
were
to
learn
a
philosophical
creed
which
might
direct
and
save
them
in
the
future
which
might
serve
as
ballast
in
public
and
private
life
just
when
the
ship
was
beginning
to
drift
in
moral
helplessness
he
was
the
founder
of
a
school
of
practical
wisdom
singularly
well
adapted
to
the
roman
character
and
intellect
which
were
always
practical
rather
than
speculative
and
far
better
suited
to
ordinary
human
life
than
the
old
rigid
and
austere
stoic
ethics
of
which
the
younger
cato
was
the
only
eminent
roman
disciple
from
what
we
know
of
panaetius
ethical
teaching
and
in
the
first
two
books
of
cicero
work
we
have
a
fairly
complete
view
of
it
we
do
not
find
the
old
doctrine
that
absolute
wisdom
and
justice
are
the
only
ends
to
pursue
and
everything
else
indifferent
a
doctrine
which
put
the
stoic
out
of
court
in
public
life
the
relative
element
the
useful
played
a
great
part
in
the
teaching
of
panaetius
though
his
system
is
based
on
the
highest
principles
to
which
moral
teaching
could
then
appeal
it
did
not
exclude
the
give
and
take
the
compromise
without
which
no
practical
man
of
affairs
can
make
way
nor
yet
the
wealth
and
bodily
comforts
that
secure
leisure
for
thought
panaetius
mission
was
carried
on
by
another
rhodian
philosopher
the
famous
posidonius
who
lived
long
enough
to
know
cicero
himself
and
many
of
his
contemporaries
a
man
less
inspiring
perhaps
than
panaetius
but
of
greater
knowledge
and
attainment
a
traveller
geographer
and
a
man
of
the
world
whose
writings
on
many
subjects
though
lost
to
us
really
lie
at
the
back
of
a
great
part
of
the
roman
literary
output
of
his
time
he
was
the
disciple
of
panaetius
envoy
from
rhodes
to
rome
in
the
terrible
year
and
later
on
the
inmate
of
roman
families
and
the
admired
friend
of
cicero
pompeius
and
varro
philosophy
was
only
one
of
the
many
pursuits
of
this
extraordinary
man
whose
literary
and
historical
influence
can
be
traced
in
almost
every
leading
roman
author
for
a
century
at
least
but
his
philosophical
importance
was
during
his
lifetime
perhaps
predominant
the
generation
that
knew
him
was
rich
in
stoics
for
example
aelius
stilo
the
master
of
varro
doctissimus
eorum
temporum
as
gellius
calls
him
rutilius
who
was
mentioned
just
now
as
having
written
memoirs
and
among
others
probably
the
great
lawyer
mucius
scaevola
cato
as
we
have
seen
was
not
a
follower
of
the
roman
school
of
stoicism
but
of
the
older
and
uncompromising
doctrine
but
cicero
though
never
a
professed
stoic
was
really
deeply
influenced
and
towards
the
end
of
his
life
almost
fascinated
by
a
creed
which
suited
his
humanity
while
it
stimulated
his
instinct
for
righteousness
and
like
cicero
many
other
men
of
serious
character
felt
the
power
of
stoicism
almost
unconsciously
without
openly
professing
it
stoicism
then
was
in
several
ways
congenial
to
the
roman
spirit
but
in
one
direction
it
had
an
inspiring
influence
which
has
been
of
lasting
moment
to
the
world
up
to
the
time
of
panaetius
and
the
scipionic
circle
the
roman
idea
and
study
of
law
had
been
of
a
crabbed
practical
character
wanting
in
breadth
of
treatment
destitute
of
any
philosophical
conception
of
the
moral
principles
which
lie
behind
all
law
and
government
the
stoic
doctrine
of
universal
law
ruling
the
world
a
divine
law
emanating
from
the
universal
reason
seems
to
have
called
up
life
in
these
dry
bones
it
might
be
held
by
a
roman
stoic
that
human
law
comes
into
existence
when
man
becomes
aware
of
the
divine
law
and
recognises
its
claim
upon
him
morality
is
thus
identical
with
law
in
the
widest
sense
of
the
word
for
both
are
equally
called
into
being
by
the
right
reason
which
is
the
universal
primary
force
it
is
not
possible
here
to
show
how
this
grand
and
elevating
idea
of
law
may
have
affected
roman
jurisprudence
but
we
will
just
notice
that
the
first
treatment
of
law
is
found
following
the
age
of
panaetius
and
the
scipionic
circle
that
the
phrase
then
begins
to
take
the
meaning
of
general
principles
or
rules
common
to
all
peoples
and
founded
on
natural
reason
and
that
this
led
by
degrees
to
the
later
idea
of
the
law
of
nature
and
to
the
cosmopolitanism
of
the
roman
legal
system
which
came
to
embrace
all
peoples
and
degrees
in
its
rational
and
beneficent
influence
if
the
greek
had
a
genius
for
beauty
and
the
jew
for
righteousness
the
roman
had
a
genius
for
law
and
the
power
of
stoicism
in
ennobling
and
enriching
his
native
conception
of
it
is
probably
not
to
be
easily
thus
behind
the
stormy
scenes
of
public
life
in
this
period
there
is
a
process
going
on
which
will
be
of
value
not
only
to
the
roman
empire
but
to
modern
civilisation
it
was
carried
on
more
especially
by
two
men
of
the
highest
character
mucius
scaevola
cicero
adviser
in
his
early
days
and
often
his
model
in
later
life
and
servius
sulpicius
rufus
his
exact
contemporary
and
lifelong
friend
neither
scaevola
nor
sulpicius
were
so
far
as
we
know
professed
disciples
of
stoicism
but
that
they
applied
perhaps
half
unconsciously
the
principles
of
stoicism
to
their
own
legal
studies
is
almost
certain
the
combination
of
legal
training
and
stoic
influence
whether
direct
or
unconscious
seems
to
have
been
capable
of
bringing
the
roman
aristocratic
character
to
a
high
pitch
of
perfection
and
it
will
be
pleasant
to
take
this
friend
of
cicero
whose
public
career
we
can
clearly
trace
and
one
or
two
of
whose
letters
we
still
possess
as
our
example
of
a
really
well
spent
life
in
an
age
when
time
and
talent
were
constantly
abused
and
wasted
sulpicius
and
cicero
were
born
in
the
same
year
they
went
hand
in
hand
in
early
life
and
remained
friends
till
their
deaths
in
sulpicius
dying
a
few
months
before
cicero
they
were
both
attached
in
early
youth
to
the
scaevola
just
mentioned
the
first
of
the
great
series
of
scientific
roman
lawyers
but
the
consulship
of
cicero
made
a
wide
divergence
in
their
lives
in
that
year
sulpicius
was
a
candidate
for
the
consulship
and
failed
and
then
resigning
further
attempts
to
obtain
the
highest
honour
he
retired
for
the
next
twelve
years
into
private
life
devoting
himself
to
the
work
which
has
made
his
name
immortal
his
writings
are
lost
nothing
remains
of
them
but
a
few
chance
fragments
and
allusions
but
he
was
reckoned
the
second
of
the
great
writers
on
legal
subjects
and
it
is
probable
that
he
contributed
as
much
as
any
of
them
to
the
work
of
making
roman
law
what
it
has
been
as
a
power
in
the
world
a
factor
in
modern
civilisation
for
he
treated
it
as
his
friend
said
of
him
with
the
hand
and
mind
of
an
artist
laying
out
his
whole
subject
and
distributing
it
into
its
constituent
parts
by
definition
and
interpretation
making
clear
what
seemed
obscure
and
distinguishing
the
false
from
the
true
in
legal
principle
in
the
splendid
panegyric
pronounced
on
him
in
the
senate
after
his
death
cicero
again
emphatically
declared
him
to
be
unrivalled
in
jurisprudence
in
beautiful
but
untranslatable
language
he
claims
that
he
was
non
magis
iuris
consultus
quam
iustitiae
an
encomium
which
all
great
lawyers
might
well
envy
he
aimed
rather
at
enabling
men
to
be
rid
of
litigation
than
at
encouraging
them
to
engage
in
it
from
such
passages
we
might
conjecture
even
if
we
knew
nothing
more
about
him
that
sulpicius
was
a
man
of
very
fine
clay
of
real
in
the
widest
sense
of
that
expressive
word
and
this
is
entirely
borne
out
in
other
ways
emerging
at
last
from
retirement
he
stood
again
for
the
consulship
in
and
was
elected
the
year
of
his
office
was
the
first
in
which
the
enemies
of
caesar
with
cato
at
their
head
began
to
attack
his
position
and
clamour
for
his
recall
from
his
command
this
violent
hostility
sulpicius
tried
not
without
temporary
success
to
restrain
and
the
fact
that
a
man
of
so
just
a
mind
should
have
taken
this
line
is
one
of
the
best
arguments
for
the
reasonableness
of
cause
when
war
broke
out
he
was
greatly
perplexed
how
to
act
his
breadth
of
view
made
decision
difficult
and
he
seems
to
have
been
at
all
times
more
a
student
than
a
man
of
action
with
some
he
joined
caesar
in
the
struggle
and
accepted
from
him
the
government
of
achaia
it
was
at
this
time
that
he
wrote
the
famous
letter
of
consolation
to
cicero
on
the
death
of
his
beloved
daughter
tullia
which
is
full
of
true
feeling
and
kindliness
though
evidently
composed
with
effort
if
not
with
difficulty
after
caesar
death
he
of
course
acted
with
cicero
against
antony
and
in
the
spring
of
making
always
for
peace
and
he
gave
his
life
for
his
country
in
a
way
that
claims
our
admiration
more
really
than
the
suicide
of
cato
the
professional
stoic
he
headed
an
embassy
to
antony
though
dangerously
ill
at
the
time
and
died
in
this
last
effort
to
obtain
a
hearing
for
the
voice
of
justice
he
has
a
aere
in
the
speech
of
his
old
friend
urging
the
senate
to
vote
him
a
public
funeral
and
a
statue
as
one
who
had
laid
down
his
life
for
his
country
we
must
now
turn
to
consider
how
the
mischievous
side
of
the
new
greek
culture
in
combination
with
other
tendencies
of
the
time
found
its
way
into
weak
points
in
the
armour
of
the
roman
aristocracy
the
pursuit
of
ease
and
pleasure
to
which
the
attainment
of
wealth
and
political
power
were
too
often
merely
subordinated
is
a
leading
characteristic
of
the
time
it
is
seen
in
many
different
forms
in
many
different
types
of
character
but
at
the
root
of
the
whole
corruption
is
the
spirit
of
the
coarser
side
of
epicureanism
as
with
roman
stoicism
so
too
with
roman
epicureanism
it
is
not
so
much
the
professed
holding
of
philosophical
tenets
that
affected
life
in
the
case
of
the
latter
system
it
was
the
coincidence
of
its
popularity
with
the
decay
of
the
old
roman
faith
and
morality
and
with
the
abnormal
opportunities
of
cato
as
a
professed
stoic
lucretius
as
an
enthusiastic
epicurean
stand
quite
apart
from
the
mass
of
men
who
were
actuated
one
way
or
the
other
by
these
philosophical
creeds
the
majority
simply
played
with
the
philosophy
while
following
the
natural
bent
of
their
individual
character
but
such
dilettanteism
was
often
quite
enough
to
affect
that
character
permanently
for
good
or
evil
epicureanism
popularised
inevitably
turns
to
vice
was
it
really
popular
at
rome
cicero
tells
us
in
a
valuable
passage
that
one
amafinius
had
written
on
it
and
that
a
great
number
of
copies
of
his
book
were
sold
partly
because
the
arguments
were
easy
to
follow
partly
because
the
doctrine
was
pleasant
and
partly
too
because
men
failed
to
get
hold
of
anything
better
the
date
of
this
amafinius
is
uncertain
but
it
is
probable
that
cicero
is
here
speaking
of
the
latter
part
of
the
second
century
and
he
goes
on
to
say
that
other
writers
took
up
the
same
line
of
teaching
and
established
it
over
the
whole
of
italy
italiam
totam
occupaverunt
if
this
was
in
the
time
of
the
social
and
civil
wars
of
the
proscriptions
of
increasing
crime
and
we
can
well
understand
that
the
doctrine
was
popular
we
have
a
remarkable
example
of
it
in
the
life
of
a
public
man
of
cicero
own
time
the
object
of
the
most
envenomed
invective
that
he
ever
uttered
we
can
not
believe
a
tithe
of
what
he
says
about
this
man
calpurnius
piso
consul
in
but
in
this
particular
matter
of
the
damage
done
him
by
epicurean
teaching
we
have
independent
evidence
which
confirms
it
piso
then
a
young
man
made
acquaintance
with
a
greek
of
this
school
of
thought
learnt
from
him
that
pleasure
was
the
sole
end
of
life
and
failing
to
appreciate
the
true
meaning
and
bearing
of
the
doctrine
fell
into
the
trap
it
was
a
dangerous
doctrine
cicero
says
for
a
youth
of
no
remarkable
intelligence
and
the
tutor
instead
of
being
the
young
man
guide
to
virtue
was
used
by
him
as
an
authority
for
vice
this
greek
was
a
certain
philodemus
a
few
of
whose
poems
are
preserved
in
the
and
a
glance
at
them
will
show
at
once
how
dangerous
such
a
man
would
be
as
the
companion
of
a
roman
youth
he
may
not
himself
have
been
a
bad
man
cicero
indeed
rather
suggests
the
contrary
calling
him
but
the
air
about
him
was
poisonous
in
his
pupil
if
we
can
trust
in
the
smallest
degree
the
picture
drawn
of
him
by
cicero
we
may
see
a
specimen
of
the
young
men
of
the
age
whose
talents
might
have
made
them
useful
in
the
world
but
for
the
strength
of
the
current
that
drew
them
into
not
only
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
but
its
correlative
the
avoidance
of
work
and
duty
can
be
abundantly
illustrated
in
this
age
and
this
too
may
have
had
a
subtle
connexion
with
epicurean
teaching
which
had
always
discouraged
the
individual
from
distraction
in
the
service
of
the
state
as
disturbing
to
the
free
development
of
his
own
virtue
sulla
did
much
hard
work
but
made
the
serious
blunder
of
retiring
to
enjoy
himself
just
when
his
new
constitutional
machinery
needed
the
most
careful
watching
and
tending
lucullus
after
showing
a
wonderful
capacity
for
work
and
a
greater
genius
for
war
than
perhaps
any
man
of
his
time
retired
from
public
life
as
a
millionaire
and
a
quietist
to
enjoy
the
wealth
that
has
become
proverbial
and
a
luxury
that
is
astonishing
even
if
we
make
due
allowance
for
the
exaggeration
of
our
accounts
of
it
to
his
library
we
have
already
been
introduced
those
who
would
see
him
in
his
or
rather
one
of
the
many
in
his
palace
may
turn
to
the
fortieth
chapter
of
plutarch
most
interesting
of
him
and
read
the
story
there
told
of
the
dinner
he
gave
to
cicero
and
pompeius
in
the
apollo
the
same
cynical
carelessness
about
public
affairs
and
neglect
of
duty
as
compared
with
private
ease
or
advantage
seems
to
have
been
characteristic
of
the
ordinary
senator
active
and
busy
in
his
own
interest
he
was
indifferent
to
that
of
the
state
there
are
distinct
signs
that
the
attendance
in
the
senate
was
not
good
when
cicero
was
away
in
cilicia
his
correspondent
writes
of
difficulties
in
getting
together
a
sufficient
number
even
for
such
important
business
as
the
settlement
of
provincial
governments
on
the
other
hand
much
private
business
was
done
and
many
jobs
perpetrated
in
a
thin
senate
in
a
tribune
proposed
that
no
senator
should
be
dispensed
from
the
action
of
a
law
unless
two
hundred
were
present
it
was
in
such
a
thin
senate
we
may
be
sure
that
the
virtuous
brutus
was
dispensed
from
the
law
which
forbade
lending
to
foreign
borrowers
in
rome
and
thus
was
enabled
to
lend
to
the
miserable
salaminians
of
cyprus
at
per
cent
and
to
recover
his
money
under
the
bond
writing
to
his
brother
in
december
cicero
speaks
of
business
done
in
a
senate
full
for
the
time
of
year
which
was
midwinter
just
before
the
saturnalia
when
only
two
hundred
were
present
out
of
about
six
hundred
in
february
a
month
when
the
senate
had
always
much
business
to
get
through
it
was
so
cold
one
day
that
the
few
members
present
clamoured
for
dismissal
and
obtained
it
and
when
the
senate
did
meet
there
was
a
constant
tendency
to
let
things
go
no
reform
of
procedure
is
mentioned
as
even
thought
of
at
a
time
when
it
was
far
more
necessary
than
in
our
parliament
business
was
talked
about
postponed
obstructed
and
personal
animosities
and
private
interests
seem
so
far
as
we
can
judge
from
the
correspondence
of
the
time
to
have
been
predominant
with
wearisome
iteration
the
letters
speak
of
nothing
done
of
business
postponed
or
of
the
passing
of
some
senatus
consultum
the
utter
futility
of
which
is
obvious
even
now
even
the
magistrates
seem
to
have
been
growing
careless
we
hear
of
a
praetor
presiding
in
the
court
de
repetundis
who
had
not
taken
the
trouble
to
acquaint
himself
with
the
text
of
the
law
which
governed
its
procedure
and
that
praetors
were
worse
than
careless
about
their
action
in
civil
cases
is
proved
by
another
law
of
the
same
tribune
cornelius
mentioned
just
now
that
praetors
should
abide
by
the
rules
laid
down
in
their
edicts
but
all
these
futilities
and
much
of
the
same
kind
outside
of
the
senate
together
with
the
quarrels
of
individuals
the
chances
and
incidents
of
elections
and
all
such
gossip
as
forms
the
staple
commodity
of
the
society
papers
of
were
a
source
of
infinite
delight
to
another
type
of
public
man
the
last
to
be
illustrated
here
if
the
older
noble
families
were
apathetic
and
idle
there
were
plenty
of
young
men
rising
most
often
from
the
class
below
whose
minds
were
intensely
active
active
in
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
but
pleasure
in
the
comparatively
harmless
form
of
amusement
and
excitement
one
of
these
the
son
of
a
banker
at
puteoli
marcus
caelius
rufus
stands
out
as
a
living
portrait
in
his
own
letters
to
cicero
of
which
no
fewer
than
seventeen
are
preserved
of
his
early
years
too
we
know
a
good
deal
told
us
in
the
speech
in
defence
of
him
spoken
by
cicero
in
the
year
and
these
combined
sources
of
information
make
him
the
most
interesting
figure
in
the
life
of
his
age
boissier
has
written
a
delightful
essay
on
him
in
his
et
ses
and
professor
tyrrell
has
done
the
like
in
the
introduction
to
the
fourth
volume
of
his
edition
of
cicero
letters
but
they
have
treated
him
less
as
a
type
of
the
youth
of
his
day
than
as
the
friend
and
pupil
of
cicero
caelius
will
always
repay
fresh
study
he
was
amusing
and
interesting
to
his
contemporaries
and
so
he
will
be
for
ever
to
us
he
is
a
veritable
proteus
you
never
know
what
shape
he
will
take
next
omnia
transformat
sese
in
miracula
rerum
we
can
trace
no
less
than
six
such
transformations
in
the
story
of
his
life
and
this
instability
let
us
note
at
once
was
not
the
restlessness
of
a
jaded
but
the
coruscation
of
a
clever
mind
wholly
without
principle
intensely
interested
in
his
in
the
life
in
which
he
moved
with
all
its
enjoyment
and
excitement
caelius
father
brought
his
son
to
cicero
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
his
toga
virilis
to
study
law
and
oratory
and
cicero
was
evidently
attracted
by
the
bright
and
lively
boy
he
never
deserted
him
and
the
last
letter
of
caelius
to
his
old
preceptor
was
written
only
just
before
his
own
sad
end
but
cicero
was
not
the
man
to
keep
an
unstable
character
out
of
mischief
he
loved
young
men
especially
clever
ones
and
was
apt
to
take
an
optimistic
view
of
them
as
he
did
of
his
own
son
and
nephew
caelius
always
attracted
by
novelty
left
cicero
and
attached
himself
to
catiline
and
for
this
vagary
as
well
as
for
his
own
want
of
success
in
controlling
his
pupil
cicero
rather
awkwardly
and
amusingly
apologises
in
the
early
chapters
of
his
speech
in
his
defence
wild
oats
must
be
sown
he
says
when
a
youth
has
given
full
fling
to
his
propensities
to
vice
they
will
leave
him
and
he
may
become
a
useful
citizen
a
dangerous
view
of
a
preceptor
duty
which
reminds
us
of
the
treatment
of
the
boy
nero
by
his
philosopher
guardian
long
afterwards
caelius
escaped
the
fate
of
catiline
and
his
crew
only
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
another
clique
not
less
dangerous
for
his
moral
welfare
he
became
one
of
a
group
of
brilliant
young
men
among
whom
were
probably
catullus
and
calvus
the
poets
who
were
lovers
and
passionate
lovers
of
the
infamous
clodia
they
were
needy
she
found
them
money
and
they
hovered
about
her
like
moths
about
a
candle
in
such
a
life
of
passion
and
pleasure
quarrels
were
inevitable
if
the
lesbia
of
catullus
be
clodia
as
we
may
believe
she
had
thrown
the
poet
over
with
a
light
heart
it
was
apparently
of
his
own
free
will
that
caelius
deserted
her
in
revenge
she
turned
upon
him
with
an
accusation
of
theft
and
attempt
to
poison
what
truth
there
was
in
the
charges
we
do
not
really
know
but
cicero
defended
him
successfully
and
in
this
way
we
come
to
know
the
details
of
this
unsteady
life
in
gratitude
and
possibly
in
shame
caelius
now
returned
to
his
old
friend
and
abandoned
the
whole
ring
of
his
vicious
companions
for
diligent
practice
in
the
courts
where
he
obtained
considerable
fame
as
an
orator
a
fragment
of
a
speech
of
his
preserved
by
quintilian
shows
as
professor
tyrrell
observes
wonderful
power
of
graphic
and
picturesque
utterance
cicero
writing
of
him
after
his
death
says
that
he
was
at
this
time
on
the
right
side
in
politics
and
that
as
tribune
of
the
plebs
in
he
successfully
supported
the
good
cause
and
checked
revolutionary
and
seditious
movements
all
was
going
well
with
him
until
cicero
went
as
governor
to
cilicia
in
cicero
seems
to
have
felt
complete
confidence
in
him
and
invited
him
to
become
his
confidential
political
correspondent
fifteen
out
of
his
seventeen
letters
were
written
in
this
capacity
these
letters
show
us
the
man
as
clearly
as
if
we
had
his
diary
before
us
caelius
is
no
idle
scamp
or
lazy
epicurean
his
mind
is
constantly
active
nothing
escapes
his
notice
the
minutest
and
most
sordid
things
delight
him
he
is
bright
happy
witty
frivolous
and
doubtless
lovable
it
is
amusing
to
see
how
cicero
himself
now
and
again
catches
the
infection
and
tries
in
vain
to
write
in
the
same
frivolous
manner
caelius
has
some
political
insight
he
sees
civil
war
approaching
but
he
takes
it
all
as
a
game
and
on
the
eve
of
events
which
were
to
shake
the
world
he
trifles
with
the
symptoms
as
though
they
were
the
silliest
gossip
of
the
capital
in
none
of
these
letters
is
there
the
smallest
vestige
of
principle
to
be
found
on
the
very
eve
of
civil
war
he
tells
cicero
that
as
soon
as
war
breaks
out
the
right
thing
to
do
is
to
join
the
stronger
side
judging
caesar
side
to
be
the
stronger
he
joined
it
accordingly
and
did
his
best
to
induce
cicero
to
do
the
same
as
boissier
happily
says
he
never
cared
to
m√©nager
ses
transitions
he
had
however
to
discover
that
if
to
change
over
to
caesar
was
the
safer
course
to
turn
a
political
somersault
once
more
to
try
and
undermine
the
work
of
the
master
meant
simply
ruin
we
have
the
story
of
his
sixth
and
last
transformation
from
caesar
himself
who
was
not
however
in
italy
at
the
time
credit
in
italy
had
been
seriously
upset
by
the
outbreak
of
civil
war
and
caesar
had
been
at
much
pains
to
steady
it
by
an
ordinance
which
has
been
alluded
to
in
the
last
chapter
in
caelius
was
praetor
in
the
master
absence
he
suddenly
took
up
the
cause
of
the
debtors
and
tried
to
evoke
appeals
against
the
decisions
of
his
colleague
trebonius
a
great
lawyer
and
a
just
man
failing
in
this
he
started
as
a
downright
revolutionary
proposing
first
the
abolition
of
and
finally
the
abolition
of
all
debts
and
milo
in
exile
at
massilia
was
summoned
to
help
him
to
raise
italy
against
caesar
this
was
too
much
and
both
were
quickly
caught
and
killed
as
they
were
stirring
up
gladiators
and
other
among
the
latifundia
of
south
italy
caelius
letters
give
us
a
chance
of
seeing
what
that
life
of
the
forum
really
was
which
so
fascinated
the
young
men
of
the
day
and
some
of
the
old
such
as
cicero
himself
we
can
see
these
children
playing
on
the
very
edge
of
the
crater
like
the
french
noblesse
before
the
revolution
in
both
cases
there
was
a
that
the
eruption
was
not
far
off
but
they
went
on
playing
what
was
it
that
so
greatly
amused
and
pleased
them
what
caelius
is
always
writing
of
is
mainly
elections
and
canvassing
accusations
and
trials
games
and
shows
elections
he
treats
as
pure
sport
as
a
kind
of
enjoyable
gambling
or
as
a
means
of
spiting
some
one
whom
you
want
to
annoy
with
elections
accusations
were
often
connected
if
a
man
were
accused
before
his
election
he
could
not
continue
to
stand
if
condemned
after
it
he
was
disqualified
here
were
ways
in
which
personal
spite
might
deprive
him
of
success
at
the
last
moment
accusations
too
were
of
course
the
best
means
by
which
an
ambitious
young
man
could
come
to
the
front
the
whole
number
of
trials
mentioned
by
caelius
is
astonishing
sometimes
there
is
such
a
complication
of
them
as
is
difficult
to
follow
every
one
is
ready
to
lay
an
accusation
without
the
smallest
regard
for
truth
young
appius
claudius
accuses
servilius
and
makes
a
mess
of
the
attack
while
the
praetor
mismanages
the
conduct
of
the
trial
so
that
nothing
comes
of
it
but
finally
appius
is
himself
accused
by
the
servilii
in
order
to
keep
him
from
further
attacks
on
servilius
appius
the
father
quarrelled
with
caelius
and
egged
on
others
to
accuse
him
though
he
was
curule
aedile
at
the
time
their
impudence
was
so
boundless
that
they
secured
that
an
information
should
be
laid
against
me
for
a
very
serious
crime
under
the
scantinian
law
scarcely
had
pola
got
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
when
i
laid
an
information
under
the
same
law
against
the
censor
appius
i
never
saw
a
more
successful
stroke
of
the
games
and
the
panthers
to
be
exhibited
at
them
about
which
caelius
is
for
ever
worrying
his
friend
in
cilicia
we
shall
see
something
in
another
chapter
there
is
plenty
of
other
gossip
in
these
letters
and
gossip
often
about
unsavoury
matters
which
need
not
be
noticed
here
it
lets
in
a
flood
of
light
upon
the
causes
of
the
general
incompetence
and
inefficiency
the
life
of
the
forum
was
a
demoralising
one

from
what
has
been
said
in
this
sketch
it
should
be
clear
that
we
have
in
the
aristocracy
of
this
period
a
complicated
society
the
various
aspects
of
which
can
hardly
be
united
in
a
single
picture
it
is
partly
a
hereditary
aristocracy
with
all
the
pride
and
exclusiveness
of
a
group
of
old
families
accustomed
to
power
and
consequence
it
is
in
the
main
a
society
of
gentlemen
dignified
in
manner
and
kindly
towards
each
other
and
it
is
also
a
society
of
high
culture
and
literary
ability
though
poor
in
creative
genius
and
unimaginative
on
the
other
hand
it
is
a
class
which
has
lost
its
interest
in
the
state
and
is
energetic
only
when
pursuing
its
own
interests
luxurious
gossiping
trifling
with
serious
matters
in
politics
because
anxious
only
for
personal
advance
rari
nantes
in
gurgite
vasto
are
the
men
who
are
really
in
earnest
but
they
are
there
we
must
not
forget
that
in
lucretius
and
cicero
this
society
produced
one
of
the
greatest
poets
and
one
of
the
most
perfect
prose
writers
that
the
world
treasures
in
sulpicius
a
lawyer
of
permanent
value
to
humanity
and
in
caesar
not
only
an
author
and
a
scholar
but
a
man
of
action
unrivalled
in
capacity
and
industry
chapter
v
marriage
and
the
roman
lady
in
order
to
appreciate
the
position
of
women
of
various
types
in
the
society
we
are
examining
it
is
necessary
to
make
it
clear
what
roman
marriage
originally
and
ideally
meant
in
any
society
it
will
be
found
that
the
position
and
influence
of
woman
can
be
fairly
well
discerned
from
the
nature
of
the
marriage
ceremony
and
the
conditions
under
which
it
is
carried
out
at
rome
in
all
periods
of
her
history
a
a
marriage
sanctioned
by
law
and
religion
and
therefore
entirely
legal
in
all
its
results
was
a
matter
of
great
moment
not
to
be
achieved
without
many
forms
and
ceremonies
the
reason
for
this
elaboration
is
obvious
at
any
rate
to
any
one
who
has
some
acquaintance
with
ancient
life
in
greece
or
italy
as
we
shall
see
later
on
the
house
was
a
residence
for
the
divine
members
of
the
family
as
well
as
the
human
the
entrance
therefore
of
a
bride
into
the
household
of
one
that
is
who
had
no
part
nor
lot
in
that
family
life
meant
some
straining
of
the
relation
between
the
divine
and
human
members
the
human
part
of
the
family
brings
in
a
new
member
but
it
has
to
be
assured
that
the
divine
part
is
willing
to
accept
her
before
the
step
taken
can
be
regarded
as
complete
she
has
to
enter
the
family
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
able
to
share
in
its
sacra
in
the
worship
of
the
household
spirits
the
ancestors
in
their
tombs
or
in
any
special
cult
attached
to
the
family
in
order
to
secure
this
eligibility
she
was
in
the
earliest
times
subjected
to
a
ceremony
which
was
clearly
of
a
sacramental
character
and
which
had
as
its
effect
the
transference
of
the
bride
from
the
hand
manus
of
her
father
from
absolute
subjection
to
him
as
the
head
of
her
own
family
to
the
hand
of
her
husband
to
absolute
subjection
to
him
as
the
head
of
her
new
family
this
sacramental
ceremony
was
called
because
a
sacred
cake
made
of
the
old
italian
grain
called
and
offered
to
jupiter
farreus
was
partaken
of
by
bride
and
bridegroom
in
the
presence
of
the
pontifex
maximus
the
flamen
dialis
and
ten
other
witnesses
at
such
a
ceremony
the
auspices
had
of
course
been
taken
and
apparently
a
victim
was
also
slain
and
offered
probably
to
ceres
the
skin
of
which
was
stretched
over
two
seats
sellae
on
which
the
bride
and
bridegroom
had
to
sit
these
details
of
the
early
form
of
patrician
marriage
are
only
mentioned
here
to
make
the
religious
character
of
the
roman
idea
of
the
rite
quite
plain
in
other
words
to
prove
that
the
entrance
of
a
bride
into
a
family
from
outside
was
a
matter
of
very
great
difficulty
and
seriousness
not
to
be
achieved
without
special
aid
and
the
intervention
of
the
gods
we
may
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
new
materfamilias
was
in
some
sort
a
priestess
of
the
household
and
that
she
must
undergo
a
solemn
initiation
before
assuming
that
position
and
we
may
still
further
illustrate
the
mystical
religious
nature
of
the
whole
rite
if
we
remember
that
throughout
roman
history
no
one
could
hold
the
priesthood
of
jupiter
flaminium
diale
or
that
of
mars
or
quirinus
or
of
the
rex
sacrorum
who
had
not
been
born
of
parents
wedded
by
confarreatio
and
that
in
each
case
the
priest
himself
must
be
married
by
the
same
ceremony
this
last
mentioned
fact
may
also
serve
to
remind
us
that
it
was
not
only
the
family
and
its
sacra
its
life
and
its
maintenance
that
called
for
the
ceremonies
making
up
a
iustum
matrimonium
but
also
the
state
and
its
sacra
its
life
and
its
maintenance
as
confarreatio
had
as
its
immediate
object
the
providing
of
a
materfamilias
fully
qualified
in
all
her
various
functions
and
as
its
further
object
the
providing
of
persons
legally
qualified
to
perform
the
most
important
sacra
of
the
state
so
marriage
in
whatever
form
had
as
its
object
at
once
the
maintenance
of
the
family
and
its
sacra
and
the
production
of
men
able
to
serve
the
state
in
peace
and
war
to
be
a
roman
citizen
you
must
be
the
product
of
a
iustum
matrimonium
from
this
initial
fact
flow
all
the
or
rights
which
together
make
up
citizenship
whether
the
private
rights
which
enable
you
to
hold
and
transfer
and
to
inherit
property
under
the
shelter
of
the
roman
law
or
the
public
rights
which
protect
your
person
against
violence
and
murder
and
enable
you
to
give
your
vote
in
the
public
assembly
and
to
seek
election
to
magistracies
marriage
then
was
a
matter
of
the
utmost
importance
in
roman
life
and
in
all
the
forms
of
it
we
find
this
importance
marked
by
due
solemnity
of
ritual
in
two
other
forms
besides
confarreatio
the
bride
could
be
brought
under
the
hand
of
her
husband
and
with
which
we
are
not
here
specially
concerned
for
long
before
the
last
century
of
the
republic
all
three
methods
had
become
practically
obsolete
or
were
only
occasionally
used
for
particular
purposes
in
the
course
of
time
it
had
been
found
more
convenient
for
a
woman
to
remain
after
her
marriage
in
the
hand
of
her
father
or
if
he
were
dead
in
the
tutela
of
a
guardian
tutor
than
to
pass
into
that
of
her
husband
for
in
the
latter
case
her
property
became
absolutely
his
the
natural
tendency
to
escape
from
the
restrictions
of
marital
may
be
illustrated
by
a
case
such
as
the
following
a
woman
under
the
of
a
guardian
wishes
to
marry
if
she
does
so
and
passes
under
the
of
her
husband
her
loses
all
control
over
her
property
which
may
probably
be
of
great
importance
for
the
family
she
is
leaving
he
therefore
naturally
objects
to
such
a
marriage
and
urges
that
she
should
be
married
without
in
fact
the
interests
of
her
own
family
would
often
clash
with
those
of
the
one
she
was
about
to
enter
and
a
compromise
could
be
effected
by
the
abandonment
of
marriage
now
this
the
abandonment
of
marriage
means
simply
that
certain
legal
consequences
of
the
marriage
ceremony
were
dropped
and
with
them
just
those
parts
of
the
ceremony
which
produced
these
consequences
otherwise
the
marriage
was
absolutely
as
valid
for
all
purposes
private
and
public
as
it
could
be
made
even
by
confarreatio
itself
the
sacramental
part
was
absent
and
the
survival
of
the
features
of
marriage
by
purchase
which
we
may
see
in
the
form
of
coemptio
was
also
absent
but
in
all
other
respects
the
marriage
ceremony
was
the
same
as
in
marriage
it
retained
all
essential
religious
features
losing
only
a
part
of
its
legal
character
it
will
be
as
well
briefly
to
describe
a
roman
wedding
of
the
type
common
in
the
last
two
centuries
of
the
republic
to
begin
with
the
boy
and
girl
for
such
they
were
as
we
should
look
on
them
even
at
the
time
of
marriage
have
been
betrothed
in
all
probability
long
before
cicero
tells
us
that
he
betrothed
his
daughter
tullia
to
calpurnius
piso
frugi
early
in
the
marriage
took
place
in
tullia
seems
to
have
been
born
in
so
that
she
was
ten
years
old
at
the
time
of
betrothal
and
thirteen
at
that
of
marriage
this
is
probably
typical
of
what
usually
happened
and
it
shows
that
the
matter
was
really
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
parents
it
was
a
family
arrangement
a
de
as
has
been
and
is
the
practice
among
many
peoples
ancient
and
modern
the
betrothal
was
indeed
a
promise
rather
than
a
definite
contract
and
might
be
broken
off
without
illegality
and
thus
if
there
were
a
strong
dislike
on
the
part
of
either
girl
or
boy
a
way
of
escape
could
be
found
however
this
may
be
we
may
be
sure
that
the
idea
of
the
marriage
was
not
that
of
a
union
for
love
though
it
was
distinguished
from
concubinage
by
an
affectio
maritalis
as
well
as
by
legal
forms
and
though
a
true
attachment
might
and
often
did
as
in
modern
times
in
like
circumstances
arise
out
of
it
it
was
the
idea
of
the
service
of
the
family
and
the
state
that
lay
at
the
root
of
the
union
this
is
well
illustrated
like
so
many
other
roman
ideas
in
the
of
virgil
those
who
persist
in
looking
on
aeneas
with
modern
eyes
and
convict
him
of
perfidy
towards
dido
forget
that
his
passion
for
dido
was
a
sudden
one
not
sanctioned
by
the
gods
or
by
favourable
auspices
and
that
the
ultimate
union
with
lavinia
for
whom
he
forms
no
such
attachment
was
one
which
would
recommend
itself
to
every
roman
as
justified
by
the
advantage
to
the
state
the
poet
it
is
true
betrays
his
own
intense
humanity
in
his
treatment
of
the
fate
of
dido
but
he
does
so
in
spite
of
his
theme
the
duty
of
every
roman
to
his
family
and
the
state
a
roman
would
no
doubt
fall
in
love
like
a
youth
of
any
other
nation
but
his
passion
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
life
of
duty
as
a
roman
this
idea
of
marriage
had
serious
consequences
to
which
we
shall
return
later
on
when
the
day
for
the
wedding
arrives
our
bride
assumes
her
bridal
dress
laying
aside
the
toga
praetexta
of
her
childhood
and
dedicating
her
dolls
to
the
lar
of
her
family
and
wearing
the
reddish
veil
and
the
woollen
girdle
fastened
with
a
knot
called
the
knot
of
hercules
she
awaits
the
arrival
of
the
bridegroom
in
her
father
house
meanwhile
the
auspices
are
being
taken
in
earlier
times
this
was
done
by
observing
the
flight
of
birds
but
now
by
examination
of
the
entrails
of
a
victim
apparently
a
sheep
if
this
is
satisfactory
the
youthful
pair
declare
their
consent
to
the
union
and
join
their
right
hands
as
directed
by
a
pronuba
a
married
woman
who
acts
as
a
kind
of
priestess
then
after
another
sacrifice
and
a
wedding
feast
the
bride
is
conducted
from
her
old
home
to
that
of
her
husband
accompanied
by
three
boys
sons
of
living
parents
one
carrying
a
torch
while
the
other
two
lead
her
by
either
hand
go
before
and
nuts
are
thrown
to
the
boys
this
charmingly
described
in
the
beautiful
poem
of
catullus
is
full
of
interesting
detail
which
must
be
omitted
here
when
the
bridegroom
house
is
reached
the
bride
smears
the
doorposts
with
fat
and
oil
and
ties
a
woollen
fillet
round
each
she
is
then
lifted
over
the
threshold
is
taken
by
her
husband
into
the
partnership
of
fire
and
water
the
essentials
of
domestic
life
and
passes
into
the
atrium
the
morrow
will
find
her
a
materfamilias
sitting
among
her
maids
in
that
atrium
or
in
the
more
private
apartments
behind
it
claudite
ostia
virgines
lusimus
satis
at
boni
coniuges
bene
vivite
et
munere
assiduo
valentem
exercete
iuventam
even
the
dissipated
catullus
could
not
but
treat
the
subject
of
marriage
with
dignity
and
tenderness
and
in
this
last
stanza
of
his
poem
he
alludes
to
the
duties
of
a
married
pair
in
language
which
would
have
satisfied
the
strictest
roman
he
has
also
touched
another
chord
which
would
echo
in
the
heart
of
every
good
citizen
in
the
delicious
lines
which
just
precede
those
quoted
and
anticipate
the
child
a
son
of
course
that
is
to
be
born
and
that
will
lie
in
his
mother
arms
holding
out
his
little
hands
and
smiling
on
his
father
nothing
can
better
illustrate
the
contrast
in
the
mind
of
the
roman
between
passionate
love
and
serious
marriage
than
a
comparison
of
this
lovely
poem
with
those
which
tell
the
sordid
tale
of
the
poet
intrigues
with
lesbia
clodia
the
beauty
and
of
married
life
as
it
used
to
be
are
still
felt
and
still
found
but
the
depths
of
human
feeling
are
not
stirred
by
them
love
lies
beyond
is
a
fact
outside
the
pale
of
the
ordered
life
of
the
family
or
the
state
no
one
who
studies
this
ceremonial
of
roman
marriage
in
the
light
of
the
ideas
which
it
indicates
and
reflects
can
avoid
the
conclusion
that
the
position
of
the
married
woman
must
have
been
one
of
substantial
dignity
calling
for
and
calling
out
a
corresponding
type
of
character
beyond
doubt
the
position
of
the
roman
materfamilias
was
a
much
more
dignified
one
than
that
of
the
greek
wife
she
was
far
indeed
from
being
a
mere
drudge
or
squaw
she
shared
with
her
husband
in
all
the
duties
of
the
household
including
those
of
religion
and
within
the
house
itself
she
was
practically
supreme
she
lived
in
the
atrium
and
was
not
shut
away
in
a
women
chamber
she
nursed
her
own
children
and
brought
them
up
she
had
entire
control
of
the
female
slaves
who
were
her
maids
she
took
her
meals
with
her
husband
but
sitting
not
reclining
and
abstaining
from
wine
in
all
practical
matters
she
was
consulted
and
only
on
questions
political
or
intellectual
was
she
expected
to
be
silent
when
she
went
out
arrayed
in
the
graceful
she
was
treated
with
respect
and
the
made
way
for
her
but
it
is
characteristic
of
her
position
that
she
did
not
as
a
rule
leave
the
house
without
the
knowledge
of
her
husband
or
without
an
escort
in
keeping
with
this
dignified
position
was
the
ideal
character
of
the
materfamilias
ideal
we
must
call
it
for
it
does
not
in
all
respects
coincide
with
the
tradition
of
roman
women
even
in
early
times
but
we
must
remember
that
at
all
periods
of
roman
history
the
woman
whose
memory
survives
is
apt
to
be
the
woman
who
is
not
the
ideal
matron
but
one
who
forces
herself
into
notice
by
violating
the
traditions
of
womanhood
the
typical
matron
would
assuredly
never
dream
of
playing
a
part
in
history
her
influence
was
behind
the
scenes
and
therefore
proportionally
powerful
the
legendary
mother
of
coriolanus
the
volumnia
of
shakespeare
cornelia
the
mother
of
the
gracchi
aurelia
caesar
mother
and
julia
his
daughter
did
indirectly
play
a
far
greater
part
in
public
life
than
the
loud
and
vicious
ladies
who
have
left
behind
them
names
famous
or
infamous
but
they
never
claimed
the
recognition
of
their
power
this
peculiar
character
of
the
roman
matron
a
combination
of
dignity
industry
and
practical
wisdom
was
exactly
suited
to
attract
the
attention
of
a
gentle
philosopher
like
plutarch
who
loved
with
genuine
moral
fervour
all
that
was
noble
and
honest
in
human
nature
not
only
does
he
constantly
refer
to
the
roman
ladies
and
their
character
in
his
and
his
but
in
his
series
of
more
than
a
hundred
roman
questions
the
first
nine
as
well
as
many
others
are
concerned
with
marriage
and
the
household
life
and
in
his
treatise
called
he
reflects
many
of
the
features
of
the
roman
matron
from
him
in
sir
thomas
translation
shakespeare
drew
the
inspiration
which
enabled
him
to
produce
on
the
elizabethan
stage
at
least
one
such
typical
matron
in
coriolanus
he
has
followed
plutarch
so
closely
that
the
reader
may
almost
be
referred
to
him
as
an
authority
and
in
the
contrast
between
the
austere
and
dignified
volumnia
and
the
passionate
and
voluptuous
cleopatra
of
the
later
play
the
poet
imagination
seems
to
have
been
guided
by
a
true
historical
instinct
we
need
not
doubt
that
the
austere
matron
of
the
old
type
survived
into
the
age
we
are
specially
concerned
with
but
we
hardly
come
across
her
in
the
literature
of
the
time
just
because
she
was
living
her
own
useful
life
and
did
not
seek
publicity
chance
has
indeed
preserved
for
us
on
stone
the
story
of
a
wonderful
lady
whose
early
years
of
married
life
were
spent
in
the
trying
time
of
the
civil
wars
of
and
who
if
a
devoted
husband
praises
are
to
be
trusted
as
indeed
they
may
be
was
a
woman
of
the
finest
roman
cast
and
endowed
with
such
a
combination
of
practical
virtues
as
we
should
hardly
have
expected
even
in
a
roman
matron
but
we
shall
return
to
this
inscription
later
on
the
ladies
whom
we
meet
with
in
cicero
letters
and
in
the
other
literature
of
the
last
age
of
the
republic
are
not
of
this
type
since
the
second
punic
war
the
roman
lady
has
changed
like
everything
else
roman
it
is
not
possible
here
to
trace
the
history
of
the
change
in
detail
but
we
may
note
that
it
seems
to
have
begun
within
the
household
in
matters
of
dress
and
expense
and
later
on
affected
the
life
and
bearing
of
women
in
society
and
politics
marriages
cum
manu
became
unusual
the
wife
remained
in
the
potestas
of
her
father
who
in
most
cases
doubtless
ceased
to
trouble
himself
about
her
and
as
her
property
did
not
pass
to
her
husband
she
could
not
but
obtain
a
new
position
of
independence
women
began
to
be
rich
and
in
the
year
a
law
was
passed
lex
voconia
forbidding
women
of
the
highest
census
who
alone
would
probably
be
concerned
to
inherit
legacies
even
before
the
end
of
the
great
war
and
when
private
luxury
would
seem
out
of
place
it
had
been
proposed
to
abolish
the
oppian
law
which
placed
restrictions
on
the
ornaments
and
apparel
of
women
and
in
spite
of
the
vehement
opposition
of
cato
then
a
young
man
the
proposal
was
successful
at
the
same
time
divorce
which
had
probably
never
been
impossible
though
it
must
have
been
rare
began
to
be
a
common
practice
we
find
to
our
surprise
that
the
virtuous
aemilius
paullus
in
other
respects
a
model
paterfamilias
put
away
his
wife
and
when
asked
why
he
did
so
replied
that
a
woman
might
be
excellent
in
the
eyes
of
her
neighbours
but
that
only
a
husband
could
tell
where
the
shoe
pinched
and
in
estimating
the
changed
position
of
women
within
the
family
we
must
not
forget
the
fact
that
in
the
course
of
the
long
and
unceasing
wars
of
the
second
century
husbands
were
away
from
home
for
years
together
and
in
innumerable
cases
must
have
perished
by
the
sword
or
pestilence
or
fallen
into
the
hands
of
an
enemy
and
been
enslaved
it
was
inevitable
that
as
the
male
population
diminished
as
it
undoubtedly
did
in
that
century
the
importance
of
woman
should
proportionately
have
increased
unfortunately
too
even
when
the
husbands
were
at
home
their
wives
sometimes
seem
to
have
wished
to
be
rid
of
them
in
the
consul
piso
was
believed
to
have
been
murdered
by
his
wife
and
whether
the
story
be
true
or
not
the
suspicion
is
at
least
significant
in
two
noble
ladies
wives
of
consulares
were
accused
of
poisoning
their
husbands
and
put
to
death
by
a
council
of
their
own
relations
though
the
evidence
in
these
cases
is
not
by
any
means
satisfactory
yet
we
can
hardly
doubt
that
there
was
a
tendency
among
women
of
the
highest
rank
to
give
way
to
passion
and
excitement
the
evidence
for
the
bacchanalian
conspiracy
of
in
which
women
played
a
very
prominent
part
is
explicit
and
shows
that
there
was
a
new
woman
even
then
who
had
ceased
to
be
satisfied
with
the
austere
life
of
the
family
and
with
the
mental
comfort
supplied
by
the
old
religion
and
was
ready
to
break
out
into
recklessness
even
in
matters
which
were
the
concern
of
the
state
that
they
had
already
begun
to
exercise
an
undue
influence
over
their
husbands
in
public
affairs
seems
suggested
by
old
cato
famous
dictum
that
all
men
rule
over
women
we
romans
rule
over
all
men
and
our
wives
rule
over
us
but
it
would
be
a
great
mistake
to
suppose
that
the
men
themselves
were
not
equally
to
blame
wives
do
not
poison
their
husbands
without
some
reason
for
hating
them
and
the
reason
is
not
difficult
to
guess
it
is
a
fact
beyond
doubt
that
in
spite
of
the
charm
of
family
life
as
it
has
been
described
above
neither
law
nor
custom
exacted
conjugal
faithfulness
from
a
husband
old
cato
represents
fairly
well
the
old
idea
of
roman
virtue
yet
it
is
clear
enough
both
from
of
him
ch
xxiv
and
from
fragments
of
his
own
writings
that
his
view
of
the
conjugal
relation
was
a
coarse
one
that
he
looked
on
the
wife
rather
as
a
necessary
agent
for
providing
the
state
with
children
than
as
a
helpmeet
to
be
tended
and
revered
and
this
being
so
we
are
not
surprised
to
find
that
men
are
already
beginning
to
dislike
and
avoid
marriage
a
most
dangerous
symptom
with
which
a
century
later
augustus
found
it
impossible
to
cope
in
the
year
just
after
tiberius
gracchus
had
been
trying
to
revive
the
population
of
italy
by
his
agrarian
law
metellus
macedonicus
the
censor
did
what
he
could
to
induce
men
to
marry
liberorum
creandorum
causa
and
a
fragment
of
a
speech
of
his
on
this
subject
became
famous
afterwards
as
quoted
by
augustus
with
the
same
object
it
is
equally
characteristic
of
roman
humour
and
roman
hardness
if
we
could
do
without
wives
he
said
to
the
people
we
should
be
rid
of
that
nuisance
but
since
nature
has
decreed
that
we
can
neither
live
comfortably
with
them
nor
live
at
all
without
them
we
must
look
rather
to
our
permanent
interests
than
to
a
passing
pleasure
now
if
we
take
into
account
these
tendencies
on
the
part
both
of
men
and
women
in
the
married
state
and
further
consider
the
stormy
and
revolutionary
character
of
the
half
century
that
succeeded
the
gracchi
the
social
and
civil
wars
the
proscriptions
of
marius
and
sulla
we
shall
be
prepared
to
find
the
ladies
of
cicero
time
by
no
means
simply
feminine
in
charm
or
homely
in
disposition
most
of
them
are
indeed
mere
names
to
us
and
we
have
to
be
careful
in
weighing
what
is
said
of
them
by
later
writers
but
of
two
or
three
of
them
we
do
in
fact
know
a
good
deal
the
one
of
whom
we
really
know
most
is
the
wife
of
cicero
terentia
an
ordinary
lady
of
no
particular
ability
or
interest
who
may
stand
as
representative
of
the
quieter
type
of
married
woman
she
lived
with
her
husband
about
thirty
years
and
until
towards
the
end
of
that
period
a
long
one
for
the
age
we
find
nothing
substantial
against
her
if
we
had
nothing
but
cicero
letters
to
her
more
than
twenty
in
number
and
his
allusions
to
her
in
other
letters
we
should
conclude
that
she
was
a
faithful
and
on
the
whole
a
sensible
wife
but
more
than
once
he
writes
of
her
delicate
health
and
as
the
poor
lady
had
at
various
times
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
go
through
it
is
quite
possible
that
as
she
grew
older
she
became
short
in
her
temper
or
trying
in
other
ways
to
a
husband
so
excitable
and
vacillating
we
find
stories
of
her
in
plutarch
and
elsewhere
which
represent
her
as
shrewish
too
careful
of
her
own
money
and
so
on
but
facts
are
of
more
account
than
the
gossip
of
the
day
and
there
is
not
a
sign
in
the
letters
that
cicero
disliked
or
mistrusted
her
until
the
year
had
there
really
been
cause
for
mistrust
it
would
have
slipped
out
in
some
letter
to
atticus
then
after
his
absence
during
the
war
he
seems
to
have
believed
that
she
had
neglected
himself
and
his
interests
his
letters
to
her
grow
colder
and
colder
and
the
last
is
one
which
as
has
been
truly
said
a
gentleman
would
not
write
to
his
housekeeper
the
pity
of
it
is
that
cicero
after
divorcing
her
married
a
young
and
rich
wife
and
does
not
seem
to
have
behaved
very
well
to
her
in
a
letter
to
atticus
xii
he
writes
that
publilia
wanted
to
come
to
him
with
her
mother
when
he
was
at
astura
devoting
himself
to
grief
for
his
daughter
and
that
he
had
answered
that
he
wished
to
be
let
alone
the
letter
shows
cicero
at
his
worst
for
once
heartless
and
discourteous
and
if
he
could
be
so
to
a
young
lady
who
wished
to
do
her
duty
by
him
what
may
he
not
have
been
to
terentia
i
suspect
that
terentia
was
quite
as
much
sinned
against
as
sinning
and
may
we
not
believe
that
of
the
innumerable
married
women
who
were
divorced
at
this
time
some
at
least
were
the
victims
of
their
husbands
callousness
rather
than
of
their
own
shortcomings
the
wife
of
cicero
brother
quintus
does
however
seem
to
have
been
a
difficult
person
to
get
on
with
she
was
a
sister
of
atticus
but
she
did
not
share
her
brother
tact
and
universal
marcus
cicero
has
recorded
i
a
scene
in
which
her
was
so
ludicrous
that
the
divorce
which
took
place
afterwards
needs
no
explanation
the
two
brothers
were
travelling
together
and
pomponia
was
with
them
something
had
irritated
her
when
they
stopped
to
lunch
at
a
place
belonging
to
quintus
at
arcanum
he
asked
his
wife
to
invite
the
ladies
of
the
party
in
nothing
as
i
thought
could
be
more
courteous
and
that
too
not
only
in
the
actual
words
but
in
his
intention
and
the
expression
of
his
face
but
she
in
the
hearing
of
us
all
exclaimed
am
only
a
stranger
here
apparently
she
had
not
been
asked
by
her
husband
to
see
after
the
luncheon
this
had
been
done
by
a
freedman
and
she
was
annoyed
there
said
quintus
that
is
what
i
have
to
put
up
with
every
day
when
he
sent
her
dishes
from
the
triclinium
where
the
gentlemen
were
having
their
meal
she
would
not
taste
them
this
little
domestic
contretemps
is
too
good
to
be
neglected
but
we
must
turn
to
women
of
greater
note
and
character
terentia
and
pomponia
and
their
kind
seem
to
have
had
nothing
in
the
way
of
higher
education
nor
do
their
husbands
seem
to
have
expected
from
them
any
desire
to
share
in
their
own
intellectual
interests
not
once
does
cicero
allude
to
any
pleasant
social
intercourse
in
which
his
wife
took
part
and
to
say
the
truth
he
would
probably
have
avoided
marriage
with
a
woman
of
taste
and
knowledge
there
were
such
women
as
we
shall
see
probably
many
of
them
ever
since
the
incoming
of
wealth
and
of
greek
education
of
theatres
and
amusements
and
all
the
pleasant
life
of
the
city
what
was
now
coming
to
be
called
had
occupied
the
minds
and
affected
the
habits
of
roman
ladies
as
well
as
men
unfortunately
it
was
seldom
that
it
was
found
compatible
with
the
old
roman
ideal
of
the
materfamilias
and
her
duties
the
invasion
of
new
manners
was
too
sudden
as
was
the
corresponding
invasion
of
wealth
such
a
lady
as
cornelia
the
famous
mother
of
the
gracchi
who
knew
what
education
really
meant
who
had
learned
men
about
her
and
could
write
well
herself
and
yet
could
combine
with
these
qualities
the
careful
discharge
of
the
duties
of
wife
and
mother
such
ladies
must
have
been
rare
and
in
cicero
time
hardly
to
be
found
more
and
more
the
notion
gained
ground
that
a
clever
woman
who
wished
to
make
a
figure
in
society
to
be
the
centre
of
her
own
could
not
well
realise
her
ambition
simply
as
a
married
woman
she
would
probably
marry
play
fast
and
loose
with
the
married
state
neglect
her
children
if
she
had
any
and
after
one
or
two
divorces
die
or
disappear
so
powerfully
did
this
idea
of
the
incompatibility
of
culture
and
wifehood
gain
possession
of
the
roman
mind
in
the
last
century
that
augustus
found
his
struggle
with
it
the
most
difficult
task
he
had
to
face
in
vain
he
exiled
ovid
for
publishing
a
work
in
which
married
women
are
most
frankly
and
explicitly
left
out
of
account
while
all
that
is
attractive
in
the
other
sex
to
a
man
of
taste
and
education
is
assumed
to
be
found
only
among
those
who
have
so
far
at
least
eschewed
the
duties
and
burdens
of
married
life
the
culta
puella
and
the
cultus
puer
of
ovid
fascinating
yet
repulsive
poem
are
the
products
of
a
society
which
looks
on
pleasure
not
reason
or
duty
as
the
main
end
of
life
not
indeed
pleasure
simply
of
the
grosser
type
but
the
gratification
of
one
own
wish
for
enjoyment
and
excitement
without
a
thought
of
the
misery
all
around
or
any
sense
of
the
that
comes
of
active
the
most
notable
example
of
a
woman
of
in
cicero
day
was
the
famous
clodia
the
lesbia
as
we
may
now
almost
assume
who
fascinated
catullus
and
then
threw
him
over
she
had
been
married
to
a
man
of
family
and
high
station
metellus
celer
who
had
died
strange
to
say
without
divorcing
her
she
must
have
been
a
woman
of
great
beauty
and
charm
for
she
seems
to
have
attracted
round
her
a
little
c√¥terie
of
clever
young
men
and
poets
to
whom
she
could
lend
money
or
accord
praise
as
suited
the
moment
whether
cicero
himself
had
once
come
within
reach
of
her
attractions
and
perhaps
suffered
by
them
is
an
open
question
and
depends
chiefly
on
statements
of
plutarch
which
may
as
has
been
said
above
have
no
better
foundation
than
the
gossip
of
society
but
we
know
how
two
typical
young
men
of
the
time
caelius
and
catullus
flew
into
the
candle
and
were
singed
we
know
how
fiercely
she
turned
on
caelius
exposing
herself
and
him
without
a
moment
hesitation
in
a
public
court
and
we
know
how
cruelly
she
treated
the
poet
who
hated
her
for
it
even
while
he
still
loved
her
odi
et
amo
quare
id
faciam
fortasse
requiris
nescio
sed
fieri
sentio
et
excrucior
catull
she
was
as
boissier
has
well
said
the
exact
counterpart
of
her
still
more
famous
brother
elle

dans
sa

descendait
all
this
is
true
we
need
not
go
beyond
it
and
believe
the
worst
that
has
been
said
of
her
we
have
just
a
glimpse
of
another
lady
of
but
only
a
glimpse
this
was
sempronia
the
wife
of
an
honest
man
and
the
mother
of
another
but
according
to
sallust
who
introduces
her
to
us
as
a
principal
in
the
conspiracy
of
catiline
she
was
one
of
those
who
found
steady
married
life
incompatible
with
literary
and
artistic
tastes
she
could
play
and
dance
more
elegantly
than
an
honest
woman
should
she
played
fast
and
loose
with
her
money
and
equally
so
with
her
good
fame
she
had
no
scruples
he
says
in
denying
a
debt
or
in
helping
in
a
murder
yet
she
had
plenty
of
could
write
verses
and
talk
brilliantly
and
she
knew
too
how
to
assume
an
air
of
modesty
on
occasion
sallust
loved
to
colour
his
portraits
highly
and
in
painting
this
woman
he
saw
no
doubt
a
chance
of
literary
effect
but
that
she
was
really
in
the
conspiracy
we
can
not
doubt
and
that
she
had
private
ends
to
gain
by
it
is
also
probable
she
seems
to
be
the
first
of
a
series
of
ladies
who
during
the
next
century
and
later
were
to
be
a
power
in
politics
and
most
of
whom
were
at
least
capable
of
crime
public
and
private
there
is
indeed
one
instance
a
few
years
earlier
of
a
woman
exercising
an
almost
supreme
influence
in
the
state
and
a
woman
too
of
the
worst
kind
plutarch
tells
us
in
the
most
explicit
way
that
when
lucullus
in
was
trying
to
secure
for
himself
the
command
against
mithridates
he
found
himself
compelled
to
apply
to
a
woman
named
praecia
whose
social
gifts
and
good
nature
gave
her
immense
influence
which
she
used
with
the
pertinacity
peculiar
to
such
ladies
her
reputation
however
was
very
bad
and
among
other
lovers
she
had
enslaved
cethegus
afterwards
the
conspirator
whose
power
at
the
time
was
immense
at
rome
thus
says
plutarch
the
whole
power
of
the
state
fell
into
the
hands
of
praecia
for
no
public
measure
was
passed
if
cethegus
was
not
for
it
in
other
words
if
praecia
did
not
recommend
it
to
him
if
the
story
be
true
as
it
seems
to
be
lucullus
gained
her
over
by
gifts
and
flattery
and
thus
cethegus
took
up
his
cause
and
got
him
the
command
even
if
we
put
aside
as
untrustworthy
a
great
deal
of
what
is
told
us
of
the
relations
of
men
and
women
in
this
period
it
must
be
confessed
that
there
is
quite
sufficient
evidence
to
show
that
they
were
loose
in
the
extreme
and
show
an
altogether
unhealthy
condition
of
family
and
social
life
the
famous
tigress
of
the
story
of
cluentius
sassia
as
she
appears
in
cicero
defence
of
him
was
beyond
doubt
a
criminal
of
the
worst
kind
however
much
we
may
discount
the
orator
rhetoric
and
her
case
proves
that
the
evil
did
not
exist
only
at
rome
but
was
to
be
found
even
in
a
provincial
town
of
no
great
importance
divorce
was
so
common
as
to
be
almost
inevitable
husbands
divorced
their
wives
on
the
smallest
pretexts
and
wives
divorced
their
husbands
even
the
virtuous
cato
seems
to
have
divorced
his
wife
marcia
in
order
that
hortensius
should
marry
her
and
after
some
years
to
have
married
her
again
as
the
widow
of
hortensius
with
a
large
fortune
cicero
himself
writes
sometimes
in
the
way
of
conjugal
relations
which
we
should
think
most
serious
and
we
find
him
telling
atticus
how
he
had
met
at
dinner
the
actress
cytheris
a
woman
of
notoriously
bad
character
i
did
not
know
she
was
going
to
be
there
he
says
but
even
the
socratic
aristippus
himself
did
not
blush
when
he
was
taunted
about
lais
reputation
in
such
matters
was
at
all
times
bad
and
though
many
of
the
stories
about
him
are
manifestly
false
his
conquest
by
cleopatra
was
a
fact
and
we
learn
with
regret
that
the
egyptian
queen
was
living
in
a
villa
of
his
in
gardens
beyond
the
tiber
during
the
year
when
he
was
himself
in
rome
it
will
be
a
relief
to
the
reader
after
spending
so
much
time
in
this
unwholesome
atmosphere
to
turn
for
a
moment
in
the
last
place
to
a
record
unique
and
entirely
credible
of
a
truly
good
and
wholesome
woman
and
of
a
long
period
of
uninterrupted
conjugal
devotion
about
the
year
not
long
before
ovid
wrote
those
poems
in
which
married
life
was
assumed
to
be
hardly
worth
living
a
husband
in
high
life
at
rome
lost
the
wife
who
had
for
years
been
his
faithful
companion
in
prosperity
his
wise
and
courageous
counsellor
in
adversity
he
recorded
her
praises
and
the
story
of
her
devotion
to
him
in
a
long
inscription
placed
as
we
may
suppose
on
the
wall
of
the
tomb
in
which
he
laid
her
to
rest
and
a
most
fortunate
chance
has
preserved
for
us
a
great
part
of
the
marble
on
which
this
inscription
was
engraved
it
is
in
the
form
of
a
laudatio
or
funeral
encomium
yet
we
can
not
feel
sure
that
he
actually
delivered
it
as
a
speech
for
throughout
it
he
addresses
not
an
audience
but
the
lost
wife
herself
in
a
manner
unique
among
such
documents
of
the
kind
as
have
come
down
to
us
he
speaks
to
her
as
though
she
were
still
living
though
passed
from
his
sight
and
it
is
just
this
that
makes
it
more
real
and
more
touching
than
any
memorial
of
the
dead
that
has
come
down
to
us
from
either
italy
or
greece
in
such
a
record
names
are
of
no
great
importance
it
is
no
great
misfortune
that
we
do
not
know
quite
for
certain
who
this
man
and
his
wife
were
but
there
is
a
very
strong
probability
that
her
name
was
turia
and
that
he
was
a
certain
lucretius
vespillo
who
served
under
pompeius
in
epirus
in
whose
romantic
adventures
in
the
proscriptions
of
are
recorded
by
appian
and
who
eventually
became
consul
under
augustus
in
we
may
venture
to
use
these
names
in
telling
the
remarkable
story
for
telling
it
here
no
apology
is
needed
for
it
has
never
been
told
in
english
as
a
whole
so
far
as
i
am
aware
it
begins
when
the
pair
were
about
to
be
married
probably
in
and
with
a
horrible
family
calamity
not
unnatural
at
the
moment
of
the
outbreak
of
a
dangerous
civil
war
both
turia
parents
were
murdered
suddenly
and
together
at
their
country
residence
perhaps
as
mommsen
suggested
by
their
own
slaves
immediately
afterwards
lucretius
had
to
leave
with
pompeius
army
for
epirus
and
turia
was
left
alone
bereft
of
both
her
parents
to
do
what
she
could
to
secure
the
punishment
of
the
murderers
alone
as
she
was
or
aided
only
by
a
married
sister
she
at
once
showed
the
courage
and
energy
which
are
obvious
in
all
we
hear
of
her
she
seems
to
have
succeeded
in
tracking
the
assassins
and
bringing
them
to
justice
even
if
i
had
been
there
myself
says
her
husband
i
could
have
done
no
more
but
this
was
by
no
means
the
only
dangerous
task
she
had
to
undertake
in
those
years
of
civil
war
and
insecurity
when
lucretius
left
her
they
seem
to
have
been
staying
at
the
villa
where
her
parents
had
been
murdered
she
had
given
him
all
her
gold
and
pearls
and
kept
him
supplied
in
his
absence
with
money
provisions
and
even
slaves
which
she
contrived
to
smuggle
over
sea
to
epirus
and
during
the
march
of
caesar
army
through
italy
she
seems
to
have
been
threatened
either
in
that
villa
or
another
by
some
detachment
of
his
troops
and
to
have
escaped
only
through
her
own
courage
and
the
clemency
of
one
whose
name
is
not
mentioned
but
who
can
hardly
be
other
than
the
great
julius
himself
a
true
gentleman
whose
instinct
and
policy
alike
it
was
throughout
this
civil
war
to
be
merciful
to
opponents
a
year
later
while
lucretius
was
still
away
yet
another
peril
came
upon
her
while
caesar
was
operating
round
dyrrhachium
there
was
a
dangerous
rising
in
campania
and
southern
italy
for
which
our
giddy
friend
caelius
rufus
was
chiefly
responsible
gladiators
and
ruffianly
shepherd
slaves
were
enlisted
and
by
some
of
these
the
villa
where
she
was
staying
was
attacked
and
successfully
defended
by
her
so
much
at
least
it
seems
possible
to
infer
from
the
fragment
recently
discovered
one
might
think
that
turia
had
already
had
her
full
share
of
trouble
and
danger
but
there
is
much
more
to
come
about
this
time
she
had
to
defend
herself
against
another
attack
not
indeed
on
her
person
but
on
her
rights
as
an
heiress
an
attempt
was
made
by
her
relations
to
upset
her
father
will
under
which
she
and
lucretius
were
appointed
equal
inheritors
of
his
property
the
result
of
this
would
have
been
to
make
her
the
sole
heiress
leaving
out
her
husband
and
her
married
sister
but
she
would
have
been
under
the
legal
or
guardianship
of
persons
whose
motive
in
attacking
the
will
was
to
obtain
administration
of
the
property
no
doubt
they
meant
to
administer
it
for
their
own
advantage
and
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
she
should
resist
them
how
she
did
it
her
husband
does
not
tell
us
but
he
says
that
the
enemy
retreated
from
his
position
yielding
to
her
firmness
and
perseverance
constantia
the
patrimonium
came
as
her
father
had
intended
to
herself
and
her
husband
and
he
dwells
on
the
care
with
which
they
dealt
with
it
he
exercising
a
over
her
share
while
she
exercised
a
over
his
very
touchingly
he
adds
but
of
this
i
leave
much
unsaid
lest
i
should
seem
to
be
claiming
a
share
in
the
praise
that
is
due
to
you
alone
when
lucretius
returned
to
italy
apparently
pardoned
by
caesar
for
the
part
he
had
taken
against
him
the
marriage
must
have
been
consummated
then
came
the
murder
of
the
dictator
which
plunged
italy
once
more
into
civil
war
until
in
antony
octavian
and
lepidus
made
their
famous
compact
and
at
once
proceeded
to
that
abominable
work
of
proscription
which
made
a
reign
of
terror
at
rome
and
spilt
much
of
the
best
roman
blood
the
happiness
of
the
pair
was
suddenly
destroyed
for
lucretius
found
himself
named
in
the
fatal
lists
he
seems
to
have
been
in
the
country
not
far
from
rome
when
he
received
a
message
from
his
wife
telling
him
of
impending
peril
that
he
might
have
to
face
at
any
moment
and
warning
him
strongly
against
a
certain
rash
course
perhaps
an
attempt
to
escape
to
sextus
pompeius
in
sicily
a
course
which
cost
the
lives
of
many
deluded
victims
she
implored
him
to
return
to
their
own
house
in
rome
where
she
had
devised
a
secure
for
him
she
meant
no
doubt
to
die
with
him
there
if
he
were
discovered
he
obeyed
his
good
genius
and
made
for
rome
by
night
it
would
seem
with
only
two
faithful
slaves
one
of
these
fell
lame
and
had
to
be
left
behind
and
lucretius
leaning
on
the
arm
of
the
other
approached
the
city
gate
suddenly
they
became
aware
of
a
troop
of
soldiers
issuing
from
it
and
lucretius
took
refuge
in
one
of
the
many
tombs
that
lined
the
great
roads
outside
the
walls
they
had
not
been
long
in
this
dismal
hiding
when
they
were
surprised
by
a
party
of
ghouls
who
haunted
these
roads
by
night
and
lived
by
robbing
tombs
or
travellers
luckily
they
wanted
rather
to
rob
than
to
murder
and
the
slave
gave
himself
up
to
them
to
be
stripped
while
his
master
who
was
no
doubt
disguised
perhaps
as
a
slave
contrived
to
slip
out
of
their
hands
and
reached
the
city
gate
safely
here
he
waited
as
we
might
expect
him
to
do
for
his
brave
companion
and
then
succeeded
in
making
his
way
into
the
city
and
to
his
house
where
his
wife
concealed
him
between
the
roof
and
the
ceiling
of
one
of
their
bedrooms
until
the
storm
should
blow
over
but
neither
life
nor
property
was
safe
until
some
pardon
and
restitution
were
obtained
from
one
at
least
of
the
triumvirs
when
at
last
these
were
conceded
by
octavian
he
was
himself
absent
in
the
campaign
that
ended
with
philippi
and
lepidus
was
consul
in
charge
of
rome
to
lepidus
turia
had
to
go
to
beg
the
confirmation
of
octavian
grace
and
this
brutal
man
received
her
with
insult
and
injury
she
fell
at
his
feet
as
her
husband
describes
with
bitter
indignation
but
instead
of
being
raised
and
congratulated
she
was
hustled
beaten
like
a
slave
and
driven
from
his
presence
but
her
perseverance
had
its
ultimate
reward
the
clemency
of
octavian
prevailed
on
his
return
to
italy
and
this
treatment
of
a
lad
was
among
the
many
crimes
that
called
for
the
eventual
degradation
of
lepidus
this
was
the
last
of
their
perilous
escapes
a
long
period
of
happy
married
life
awaited
them
more
particularly
after
the
battle
of
actium
when
peace
and
the
republic
were
restored
one
thing
only
was
wanting
to
complete
their
perfect
felicity
they
had
no
children
it
was
this
that
caused
turia
to
make
a
proposal
to
her
husband
which
coming
from
a
truly
unselfish
woman
and
seen
in
the
light
of
roman
ideas
of
married
life
is
far
from
unnatural
but
to
us
it
must
seem
astonishing
and
it
filled
lucretius
with
horror
she
urged
that
he
should
divorce
her
and
take
another
wife
in
the
hope
of
a
son
and
heir
if
there
is
nothing
very
surprising
in
this
from
a
roman
point
of
view
it
is
indeed
to
us
both
surprising
and
touching
that
she
should
have
supported
her
request
by
a
promise
that
she
would
be
as
much
a
mother
to
the
expected
children
as
their
own
mother
and
would
still
be
to
lucretius
a
sister
having
nothing
apart
from
him
nothing
secret
and
taking
away
with
her
no
part
of
their
inheritance
to
us
reading
this
proposal
in
cold
blood
just
nineteen
hundred
years
after
it
was
made
it
may
seem
foolishly
impracticable
to
her
whose
whole
life
was
spent
in
unselfish
devotion
to
her
husband
interests
whose
warm
love
for
him
was
always
mingled
with
discretion
it
was
simply
an
act
of
pietas
of
wifely
duty
yet
he
could
not
for
a
moment
think
so
himself
his
indignation
at
the
bare
idea
of
it
lives
for
ever
on
the
marble
in
glowing
words
i
must
confess
he
says
that
the
anger
so
burnt
within
me
that
my
senses
almost
deserted
me
that
you
should
ever
have
thought
it
possible
that
we
could
be
separated
but
by
death
was
most
horrible
to
me
what
was
the
need
of
children
compared
with
my
loyalty
to
you
why
should
i
exchange
certain
happiness
for
an
uncertain
future
but
i
say
no
more
of
this
you
remained
with
me
for
i
could
not
yield
without
disgrace
to
myself
and
unhappiness
to
both
of
us
the
one
sorrow
that
was
in
store
for
me
was
that
i
was
destined
to
survive
you
these
two
we
may
feel
sure
were
wholly
worthy
of
each
other
what
she
would
have
said
of
him
if
he
had
been
the
first
to
go
we
can
only
guess
but
he
has
left
a
portrait
of
her
as
she
lived
and
worked
in
his
household
which
mutilated
though
it
is
may
be
inadequately
paraphrased
as
follows
you
were
a
faithful
wife
to
me
he
says
and
an
obedient
one
you
were
kind
and
gracious
sociable
and
friendly
you
were
assiduous
at
your
spinning
lanificia
you
followed
the
religious
rites
of
your
family
and
your
state
and
admitted
no
foreign
cults
or
degraded
magic
superstitio
you
did
not
dress
conspicuously
nor
seek
to
make
a
display
in
your
household
arrangements
your
duty
to
our
whole
household
was
exemplary
you
tended
my
mother
as
carefully
as
if
she
had
been
your
own
you
had
innumerable
other
excellences
in
common
with
all
other
worthy
matrons
but
these
i
have
mentioned
were
peculiarly
yours
no
one
can
study
this
inscription
without
becoming
convinced
that
it
tells
an
unvarnished
tale
of
truth
that
here
was
really
a
rare
and
precious
woman
a
roman
matron
of
the
very
best
type
practical
judicious
courageous
simple
in
her
habits
and
courteous
to
all
her
guests
and
we
feel
that
there
is
one
human
being
and
one
only
of
whom
she
is
always
thinking
to
whom
she
has
given
her
whole
heart
the
husband
whose
words
and
deeds
show
that
he
was
wholly
worthy
of
her
chapter
vi
the
education
of
the
upper
classes
from
what
has
been
said
in
preceding
chapters
of
the
duties
and
the
habits
of
the
two
sections
of
the
upper
stratum
of
society
it
will
readily
be
inferred
that
the
kind
of
education
called
for
was
one
mainly
of
character
in
these
men
whether
for
the
work
of
business
or
of
government
what
was
wanted
was
the
will
to
do
well
and
justly
and
the
instinctive
hatred
of
all
evil
and
unjust
dealing
such
an
education
of
the
will
and
character
is
supplied
whatever
be
its
shortcomings
in
other
ways
by
our
english
public
school
education
for
men
whose
work
in
life
is
in
many
ways
singularly
like
that
of
the
roman
upper
classes
such
an
education
too
was
outlined
by
aristotle
for
the
men
of
his
ideal
state
and
newman
picture
of
the
probable
results
of
it
is
so
suggestive
of
what
was
really
needed
at
rome
that
i
may
quote
it
here
as
its
outcome
at
the
age
of
we
may
imagine
a
bronzed
and
hardy
youth
healthy
in
body
and
mind
able
to
bear
hunger
and
hard
physical
labour
not
untouched
by
studies
which
awake
in
men
the
interest
of
civilised
beings
and
prepare
them
for
the
right
use
of
leisure
in
future
years
and
though
burdened
with
little
knowledge
possessed
of
an
educated
sense
of
beauty
and
an
ingrained
love
of
what
is
noble
and
hatred
of
all
that
is
the
reverse
he
would
be
more
cultivated
and
human
than
the
best
type
of
young
spartan
more
physically
vigorous
and
reverential
though
less
intellectually
developed
than
the
best
type
of
young
athenian
a
nascent
soldier
and
servant
of
the
state
not
like
most
young
athenians
of
ability
a
nascent
orator
and
as
he
would
be
only
half
way
through
his
education
at
an
age
when
many
greeks
had
finished
theirs
he
would
be
more
conscious
of
his
own
immaturity
we
feel
at
once
how
different
he
would
be
from
the
clever
lads
who
swarmed
at
athens
youths
with
an
infinite
capacity
for
picking
holes
and
capable
of
saying
something
plausible
on
every
subject
under
the
sun
if
we
note
with
newman
that
aristotle
here
makes
if
anything
too
little
of
intellectual
training
as
indeed
may
also
be
said
of
our
own
public
schools
and
add
to
his
picture
something
more
of
that
knowledge
which
when
united
with
an
honest
will
and
healthy
body
will
almost
infallibly
produce
a
sound
judgment
we
shall
have
a
type
of
character
eminently
fitted
to
share
in
the
duties
and
the
trials
of
the
government
of
such
empires
as
the
roman
and
the
british
but
at
rome
in
the
age
of
cicero
such
a
type
of
character
was
rare
indeed
and
though
this
was
due
to
various
causes
some
of
which
have
been
already
noticed
the
building
up
of
a
roman
empire
before
the
romans
were
ripe
to
appreciate
the
duties
of
an
imperial
state
and
the
sudden
incoming
of
wealth
in
an
age
when
the
idea
of
its
productive
use
was
almost
unknown
yet
it
will
occur
to
every
reader
that
there
must
have
been
also
something
wrong
in
the
upbringing
of
the
youth
of
the
upper
classes
to
account
for
the
rarity
of
really
sound
character
for
the
frequent
absence
of
what
we
should
call
the
sense
of
duty
public
and
private
i
propose
in
this
chapter
to
deal
with
the
question
of
roman
education
just
so
far
as
to
show
where
in
time
it
was
chiefly
defective
it
is
a
subject
that
has
been
very
completely
worked
out
and
an
excellent
summary
of
the
results
will
be
found
in
the
little
volume
on
roman
education
written
by
the
late
professor
wilkins
just
before
his
lamented
death
but
he
was
describing
its
methods
without
special
reference
to
its
defects
and
it
is
these
defects
on
which
i
wish
more
particularly
to
dwell
let
us
notice
in
the
first
place
how
little
is
said
in
the
literature
of
the
time
including
biographies
of
that
period
of
life
which
is
now
so
full
of
interest
to
readers
of
memoirs
so
full
of
interest
to
ourselves
as
we
look
back
to
it
in
advancing
years
it
may
be
that
we
now
exaggerate
the
importance
of
childhood
but
it
is
equally
certain
that
the
romans
undervalued
the
importance
of
it
it
may
be
that
we
the
value
of
our
life
but
it
is
certain
that
the
romans
had
no
such
school
life
to
be
proud
of
biography
was
at
this
time
a
favourite
form
of
literature
and
some
of
the
memoirs
then
written
were
available
for
use
by
later
writers
such
as
valerius
maximus
suetonius
and
plutarch
yet
it
is
curious
how
little
has
come
down
to
us
of
the
childhood
or
boyhood
of
the
great
men
of
the
time
plutarch
indeed
was
deeply
interested
in
education
including
that
of
childhood
and
we
can
hardly
doubt
that
he
would
have
used
in
his
roman
lives
any
information
that
came
in
his
way
he
does
tell
us
something
for
which
we
are
eternally
indebted
to
him
of
old
cato
method
of
educating
his
son
and
something
too
in
his
of
aemilius
of
the
education
of
the
eldest
son
of
that
family
the
great
scipio
aemilianus
but
in
each
of
these
lives
we
shall
find
that
this
information
is
used
rather
to
bring
out
the
character
of
the
father
than
to
illustrate
the
upbringing
of
the
son
and
as
a
rule
the
lives
begin
with
the
parentage
of
the
hero
and
then
pass
on
at
once
to
his
early
manhood
the
life
of
the
younger
cato
however
is
an
exception
to
the
rule
which
we
must
ascribe
to
the
attraction
which
all
historians
and
philosophers
felt
to
this
singular
character
plutarch
knew
the
naiue
and
character
of
cato
paedagogus
sarpedon
and
tells
us
that
he
was
an
obedient
child
but
would
ask
for
the
reason
of
everything
in
those
questions
beginning
with
why
which
are
often
embarrassing
to
the
teacher
two
stories
in
the
second
and
third
chapters
of
this
life
are
also
found
in
that
insipid
medley
of
fact
and
fable
drawn
up
in
the
reign
of
tiberius
by
valerius
maximus
for
educational
purposes
a
third
which
is
peculiarly
significant
and
seems
to
bear
the
stamp
of
truth
is
only
to
be
found
in
plutarch
i
give
it
here
in
full
on
another
occasion
when
a
kinsman
on
his
birthday
invited
some
boys
to
supper
and
cato
with
them
in
order
to
pass
the
time
they
played
in
a
part
of
the
house
by
themselves
younger
and
older
together
and
the
game
consisted
of
accusations
and
trials
and
the
arresting
of
those
who
were
convicted
now
one
of
the
boys
convicted
who
was
of
a
handsome
presence
being
dragged
off
by
an
older
boy
to
a
chamber
and
shut
up
called
on
cato
for
aid
cato
seeing
what
was
going
on
came
to
the
door
and
pushing
through
those
who
were
posted
in
front
of
it
to
prevent
him
took
the
boy
out
and
went
off
home
with
him
in
a
passion
accompanied
by
other
boys
this
is
a
unique
picture
of
the
ways
and
games
of
boys
in
the
last
century
of
the
republic
like
the
children
of
all
times
they
play
at
that
in
which
they
see
their
fathers
most
active
and
interested
and
this
particular
game
must
have
been
played
in
the
miserable
years
of
the
civil
wars
and
the
proscriptions
as
cato
was
born
in
whether
the
part
played
by
cato
in
the
story
be
true
or
not
the
lesson
for
us
is
the
same
and
we
shall
find
it
entirely
confirmed
in
the
course
of
this
chapter
the
main
object
of
education
was
the
mastery
of
the
art
of
oratory
and
the
chief
practical
use
of
that
art
was
to
enable
a
man
to
gain
a
reputation
as
an
advocate
in
the
criminal
courts
cicero
had
one
boy
and
for
several
years
two
to
look
after
one
his
own
son
marcus
born
in
and
the
other
quintus
the
son
of
his
brother
a
year
older
of
these
boys
until
they
took
the
toga
virilis
he
says
hardly
anything
in
his
letters
to
atticus
though
atticus
was
the
uncle
of
the
elder
boy
only
when
his
brother
quintus
was
with
caesar
in
gaul
do
we
really
begin
to
hear
anything
about
them
and
even
then
more
than
once
after
a
brief
mention
of
the
young
quintus
he
goes
off
at
once
to
tell
his
brother
about
the
progress
of
the
villas
that
are
being
built
for
him
but
it
is
clear
that
the
father
wished
to
know
about
the
boy
as
well
as
about
the
villas
and
in
one
letter
we
find
cicero
telling
quintus
that
he
wishes
to
teach
his
boy
himself
as
he
has
been
teaching
his
own
son
i
do
wonders
with
him
if
i
can
get
him
to
myself
when
i
am
at
leisure
for
at
rome
there
is
not
time
to
breathe
nam
romae
respirandi
non
est
locus
it
is
clear
that
the
boys
who
were
only
eleven
and
twelve
in
this
year
were
being
educated
at
home
and
as
clear
too
that
cicero
who
was
just
then
very
much
occupied
in
the
courts
had
no
time
to
attend
to
them
himself
young
quintus
we
hear
gets
on
well
with
his
rhetoric
master
cicero
does
not
wholly
approve
the
style
in
which
he
is
being
taught
and
thinks
he
may
be
able
to
teach
him
his
own
more
learned
style
though
the
boy
himself
seems
to
prefer
the
declamatory
method
of
the
teacher
the
last
entry
in
these
letters
to
the
absent
father
is
curious
i
love
your
cicero
as
he
deserves
and
as
i
ought
but
i
am
letting
him
leave
me
because
i
do
want
to
keep
him
from
his
masters
and
because
his
mother
is
going
away
and
without
her
i
am
nervous
about
his
greediness
up
to
this
point
he
has
written
in
the
warmest
terms
of
the
boy
but
here
as
so
often
in
cicero
letters
about
other
people
disapprobation
is
barely
hinted
in
order
not
to
hurt
the
feelings
of
his
correspondent
the
one
thing
that
is
really
pleasing
in
these
allusions
is
the
genuine
desire
of
both
parents
that
their
boys
shall
be
of
good
disposition
and
well
educated
but
of
real
training
or
of
home
discipline
we
unluckily
get
no
hint
we
must
go
elsewhere
for
what
little
we
know
about
the
training
of
children
let
us
now
turn
to
this
for
a
while
remembering
that
it
means
parental
example
and
the
discipline
of
the
body
as
well
as
the
acquisition
of
elementary
knowledge
unfortunately
no
book
has
survived
from
that
age
in
which
the
education
of
children
was
treated
of
varro
wrote
such
a
book
but
we
know
of
it
little
more
than
its
name
sive
de
liberis
in
the
fourth
book
of
his
cicero
seems
to
have
dealt
with
disciplina
puerilis
but
from
the
few
fragments
that
survive
there
is
little
to
be
learnt
and
we
may
be
pretty
sure
that
cicero
could
not
write
of
this
with
much
knowledge
or
experience
the
most
famous
passage
is
that
in
which
he
quotes
polybius
as
blaming
the
romans
for
neglecting
it
certainly
he
adds
they
never
wished
that
the
state
should
regulate
the
education
of
children
or
that
it
should
be
all
on
one
model
the
greeks
took
much
unnecessary
trouble
about
it
the
greeks
of
his
own
time
whom
cicero
knew
did
not
inspire
him
with
any
exalted
idea
of
the
results
of
greek
education
but
we
should
like
to
know
whether
in
this
book
of
his
work
on
the
state
he
did
not
express
some
feeling
that
on
the
children
themselves
and
therefore
on
their
training
the
fortunes
of
the
state
depend
such
had
been
the
feeling
of
the
old
romans
though
their
state
laid
down
no
laws
for
education
but
trusted
to
the
force
of
tradition
and
custom
old
cato
believed
himself
to
be
acting
like
an
old
roman
when
he
looked
after
the
washing
and
dressing
of
his
baby
and
guided
the
child
with
personal
care
as
he
grew
up
writing
books
for
his
use
in
large
letters
with
his
own
hand
but
since
cato
day
the
idea
of
the
state
had
lost
strength
and
this
had
an
unfortunate
effect
on
education
as
on
married
life
the
one
hope
of
the
age
the
stoic
philosophy
was
concerned
with
those
who
had
attained
to
reason
to
those
who
had
reached
their
fourteenth
year
in
the
stoic
view
the
child
was
indeed
potentially
reasonable
and
thus
a
subject
of
interest
but
in
the
stoic
ethics
education
does
not
take
a
very
prominent
place
we
are
driven
to
the
conclusion
that
a
real
interest
in
education
as
distinct
from
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
was
as
much
wanting
at
rome
in
cicero
day
as
it
has
been
till
lately
in
england
and
that
it
was
not
again
awakened
until
christianity
had
made
the
children
sacred
not
only
because
the
master
so
spoke
of
them
but
because
they
were
inheritors
of
eternal
life
yet
there
had
once
been
a
roman
home
education
admirably
suited
to
bring
up
a
race
of
hardy
and
dutiful
men
and
women
it
was
an
education
in
the
family
virtues
thereafter
to
be
turned
to
account
in
the
service
of
the
state
the
mother
nursed
her
own
children
and
tended
them
in
their
earliest
years
then
followed
an
education
which
we
may
call
one
in
bodily
activity
in
demeanour
in
religion
and
in
duty
to
the
state
it
is
true
that
we
have
hardly
any
evidence
of
this
but
tradition
but
when
varro
in
one
of
the
precious
fragments
of
his
book
on
education
describes
his
own
bringing
up
in
his
sabine
home
at
reate
we
may
be
fairly
sure
that
it
adequately
represents
that
of
the
old
roman
farmer
he
tells
us
that
he
had
a
single
tunic
and
toga
was
seldom
allowed
a
bath
and
was
made
to
learn
to
ride
bareback
which
reminds
us
of
the
life
of
the
young
boer
of
the
transvaal
before
the
late
war
in
another
fragment
he
also
tells
us
that
both
boys
and
girls
used
to
wait
on
their
parents
at
table
cato
the
elder
in
a
fragment
preserved
by
festus
says
that
he
was
brought
up
from
his
earliest
years
to
be
frugal
hardy
and
industrious
and
worked
steadily
on
the
farm
in
the
sabine
country
in
a
stony
region
where
he
had
to
dig
and
plant
the
flinty
soil
the
tradition
of
such
a
healthy
rearing
remained
in
the
memory
of
the
romans
and
associated
itself
with
the
sabines
of
central
italy
the
type
of
men
who
could
be
called
rusticorum
mascula
militum
proles
sabellis
docta
ligonibus
versare
glebas
et
severae
matris
ad
arbitrium
recisos
portare
fustis
it
was
an
education
also
in
demeanour
and
especially
in
obedience
and
modesty
in
that
chapter
of
plutarch
of
which
has
been
already
quoted
after
describing
how
the
father
taught
his
boy
to
ride
to
box
to
swim
and
so
on
he
goes
on
and
he
was
as
careful
not
to
utter
an
indecent
word
before
his
son
as
he
would
have
been
in
the
presence
of
the
vestal
virgins
the
of
childhood
was
always
esteemed
at
rome
adolescens
pudentissimus
is
the
highest
praise
that
can
be
given
even
to
a
grown
youth
and
there
are
signs
that
a
feeling
survived
of
a
certain
sacredness
of
childhood
which
juvenal
reflects
in
his
famous
words
maxima
debetur
puero
reverentia
the
origin
of
this
feeling
is
probably
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
both
boys
and
girls
were
in
ancient
times
brought
up
to
help
in
performing
the
religious
duties
of
the
household
as
camilli
and
camillae
acolytes
and
this
is
perhaps
the
reason
why
they
wore
throughout
roman
history
the
toga
praetexta
with
the
purple
stripe
like
magistrates
and
sacrificing
priests
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
this
religious
side
of
education
was
an
education
in
the
practice
of
cult
and
not
in
any
kind
of
creed
or
ideas
about
the
gods
but
so
far
as
it
went
its
influence
was
good
as
instilling
the
habit
of
reverence
and
the
sense
of
duty
from
a
very
early
age
though
the
romans
of
cicero
time
had
lost
their
old
conviction
of
the
necessity
of
propitiating
the
gods
of
the
state
it
is
probable
that
the
tradition
of
family
worship
still
survived
in
the
majority
of
households
again
we
may
be
sure
that
the
idea
of
duty
to
the
state
was
not
omitted
in
this
education
cato
wrote
histories
for
his
son
in
large
letters
so
that
without
stirring
out
of
the
house
he
might
gain
a
knowledge
of
the
illustrious
actions
of
the
ancient
romans
and
of
the
customs
of
his
country
but
it
is
significant
that
in
the
next
two
or
three
generations
the
writers
of
annals
took
to
glorifying
and
falsifying
the
achievements
of
members
of
their
own
families
rather
than
those
of
the
state
as
a
whole
boys
learnt
the
xii
tables
by
heart
and
cicero
tells
us
that
he
did
this
in
his
own
boyhood
though
the
practice
had
since
then
been
dropped
that
ancient
code
of
law
would
have
acted
we
may
imagine
as
a
kind
of
catechism
of
the
rules
laid
down
by
the
state
for
the
conduct
of
its
citizens
and
as
a
reminder
that
though
the
state
had
outgrown
the
rough
legal
clothing
of
its
infancy
it
had
from
the
very
beginning
undertaken
the
duty
of
regulating
the
conduct
of
its
citizens
in
their
relations
with
each
other
again
when
a
great
roman
died
it
is
said
to
have
been
the
practice
for
parents
to
take
their
boys
to
hear
the
funeral
oration
in
praise
of
one
who
had
done
great
service
to
the
state
all
this
was
admirable
and
if
rome
had
not
become
a
great
imperial
state
and
if
some
of
the
humanities
could
have
been
added
in
a
natural
process
of
development
it
might
have
continued
for
ages
as
an
invaluable
educational
basis
but
the
conditions
under
which
alone
it
could
flourish
had
long
ceased
to
be
it
is
obvious
that
it
depended
entirely
on
the
presence
of
the
parents
and
their
interest
in
the
children
as
regards
the
boys
it
depended
chiefly
on
the
father
now
ever
since
the
roman
dominion
was
extended
beyond
sea
ever
since
the
first
two
punic
wars
the
father
of
a
family
must
often
have
been
away
from
home
for
long
periods
he
might
have
to
serve
in
foreign
wars
for
years
together
and
in
numberless
cases
never
saw
italy
again
even
if
he
remained
in
rome
the
ever
increasing
business
of
the
state
would
occupy
him
far
more
than
was
compatible
with
a
constant
personal
care
for
his
children
the
conscientious
roman
father
of
the
last
two
centuries
must
have
felt
even
more
keenly
than
english
parents
in
india
the
sorrow
of
parting
from
their
children
at
an
age
when
they
are
most
in
need
of
parental
care
we
have
to
remember
that
in
cicero
day
had
only
recently
become
possible
on
an
extended
scale
through
the
increasing
business
of
the
publicani
in
the
provinces
see
above
the
roman
father
in
spain
or
asia
seldom
heard
of
what
his
wife
and
children
were
doing
and
the
inevitable
result
was
that
he
began
to
cease
to
care
in
fact
more
and
more
came
to
depend
on
the
mothers
as
with
our
own
professional
classes
and
we
have
seen
reason
to
believe
that
in
the
last
age
of
the
republic
the
average
mother
was
not
too
often
a
conscientious
or
dutiful
woman
the
constant
liability
to
divorce
would
naturally
diminish
her
interest
in
her
children
for
after
separation
she
had
no
part
or
lot
in
them
and
this
no
doubt
is
one
reason
why
at
this
particular
period
we
hear
so
little
of
the
life
of
children
there
is
indeed
no
reason
to
suppose
that
they
themselves
were
unhappy
they
had
plenty
of
games
which
were
so
familiar
that
the
poets
often
allude
to
them
hoops
tops
dolls
blind
man
buff
and
the
favourite
games
of
nuts
and
king
but
the
real
question
is
not
whether
they
could
enjoy
their
young
life
but
whether
they
were
learning
to
use
their
bodies
and
minds
to
good
purpose
when
a
boy
was
about
seven
years
old
the
question
would
arise
in
most
families
whether
he
should
remain
at
home
or
go
to
an
elementary
school
no
doubt
it
was
usually
decided
by
the
means
at
the
command
of
the
parents
a
wealthy
father
might
see
his
son
through
his
whole
education
at
home
by
providing
a
tutor
paedagogus
and
more
advanced
teachers
as
they
were
needed
cato
indeed
as
we
have
seen
found
time
to
do
much
of
the
work
himself
but
he
also
had
a
slave
who
taught
his
own
and
other
children
aemilius
paullus
had
several
teachers
in
his
house
for
this
purpose
under
his
own
superintendence
cicero
too
as
we
have
seen
seems
to
have
educated
his
son
at
home
though
he
himself
is
said
to
have
attended
a
school
but
we
may
suppose
that
the
ordinary
boy
of
the
upper
classes
went
to
school
under
the
care
of
a
paedagogus
after
the
greek
fashion
rising
before
daylight
and
submitting
to
severe
discipline
which
together
with
the
absolute
necessity
for
a
free
roman
of
attaining
a
certain
level
of
acquirement
effectually
compelled
him
to
learn
to
read
write
and
cipher
this
elementary
work
must
have
been
done
well
we
hear
little
or
nothing
of
gross
ignorance
or
neglected
education
there
were
however
very
serious
defects
in
this
system
of
elementary
education
not
only
the
schoolmaster
himself
but
the
paedagogus
who
was
responsible
for
the
boy
conduct
was
almost
always
either
a
slave
or
a
freedman
and
neither
slave
nor
freedman
could
be
an
object
of
profound
respect
for
a
roman
boy
hence
no
doubt
the
necessity
of
maintaining
discipline
rather
by
means
of
corporal
punishment
to
which
the
romans
never
seem
to
have
objected
though
quintilian
criticises
it
than
by
moral
force
a
fact
which
is
attested
both
in
literature
and
art
the
responsibility
again
which
attached
to
the
paedagogus
for
the
boy
morals
must
have
been
another
inducement
to
the
parents
to
renounce
their
proper
work
of
supervision
and
once
more
the
great
majority
of
teachers
were
greeks
as
the
boy
was
born
into
a
bilingual
world
of
which
the
greeks
were
the
only
cultured
people
this
might
seem
natural
and
inevitable
but
we
know
that
in
his
heart
the
roman
despised
the
greek
of
witnesses
in
their
favour
we
might
expect
cicero
to
be
the
strongest
but
cicero
occasionally
lets
us
know
what
he
really
thinks
of
their
moral
character
in
a
remarkable
passage
in
his
speech
for
flaccus
which
is
fully
borne
out
by
remarks
in
his
private
letters
he
says
that
he
grants
them
all
manner
of
literary
and
rhetorical
skill
but
that
the
race
never
understood
or
cared
for
the
sacred
binding
force
of
testimony
given
in
a
court
of
law
thus
the
roman
boy
was
in
the
anomalous
position
of
having
to
submit
to
chastisement
from
men
whom
as
men
he
despised
assuredly
we
should
not
like
our
public
schoolboys
to
be
taught
or
punished
by
men
of
low
station
or
of
an
inferior
standard
of
morals
it
is
men
not
methods
that
really
tell
in
education
the
roman
schoolboy
needed
some
one
to
believe
in
some
one
to
whom
to
be
wholly
loyal
the
very
same
overpowering
need
which
was
so
obvious
in
the
political
world
of
rome
in
the
last
century
of
this
elementary
teaching
little
need
be
said
here
as
it
did
not
bear
directly
on
life
and
conduct
there
is
however
one
feature
of
it
which
may
claim
our
attention
for
a
moment
both
in
reading
and
writing
and
also
for
learning
by
heart
greek
gnomai
were
used
which
remind
us
of
our
maxims
of
these
we
have
a
large
collection
more
than
selected
from
the
mimes
of
publilius
syrus
who
came
to
rome
from
syria
as
a
slave
in
the
age
of
which
we
are
writing
and
after
obtaining
his
freedom
gained
great
reputation
as
the
author
of
many
popular
plays
of
this
kind
in
which
he
contrived
to
insert
these
wise
saws
and
maxims
it
is
not
likely
that
they
found
their
way
into
the
schools
all
at
once
but
in
the
early
empire
we
find
them
already
alluded
to
as
educational
material
by
seneca
the
elder
and
we
may
take
them
as
a
fair
example
of
the
maxims
already
in
use
in
cicero
time
making
some
allowance
for
their
superior
neatness
and
wisdom
here
are
a
few
specimens
taken
almost
at
random
it
will
be
seen
that
they
convey
much
shrewd
good
sense
and
occasionally
have
the
true
ring
of
humanity
as
well
as
the
flavour
of
stoic

have
quoted
these
to
show
that
roman
children
were
not
without
opportunity
even
in
early
schooldays
of
laying
to
heart
much
that
might
lead
them
to
good
and
generous
conduct
in
later
life
as
well
as
to
practical
wisdom
but
we
know
the
fate
of
our
own
maxims
we
know
that
it
is
not
through
them
that
our
children
become
good
men
and
women
but
by
the
example
and
the
precepts
of
parents
and
teachers
no
such
neat
greek
gnomai
can
do
much
good
without
a
sanction
of
greater
force
than
any
that
is
inherent
in
them
and
such
a
sanction
was
not
to
be
found
in
the
ferula
of
the
grammaticus
or
the
paedagogus
once
more
it
is
men
and
not
methods
that
supply
the
real
educational
force
probably
the
greatest
difficulty
which
the
roman
boy
had
to
face
in
his
school
life
was
the
learning
of
arithmetic
it
was
this
we
may
imagine
that
made
him
think
of
his
master
as
horace
did
of
the
worthy
orbilius
as
a
man
of
blows
plagosus
this
is
not
the
place
to
give
an
account
of
the
methods
of
reckoning
then
used
they
will
be
found
fully
explained
in
marquardt
and
compressed
into
a
page
by
professor
wilkins
in
his
it
is
enough
to
say
that
they
were
as
indispensable
as
they
were
difficult
to
learn
an
orator
was
expected
according
to
quintilian
i
not
only
to
be
able
to
make
his
calculations
in
court
but
also
to
show
clearly
to
his
audience
how
he
arrived
at
his
results
from
the
small
to
the
great
capitalist
every
man
of
business
needed
to
be
perfectly
at
home
in
reckoning
sums
of
money
the
magistrates
especially
quaestors
and
aediles
had
staffs
of
clerks
who
must
have
been
skilled
accountants
the
provincial
governors
and
all
who
were
engaged
in
collecting
the
tributes
of
the
provinces
as
well
as
in
lending
the
money
to
enable
the

busy
with
their

the
humbler
inhabitants
of

had
long
been
growing

this
familiar
passage
may
be
quoted
once
more
to
illustrate
the
practical
nature
of
the
roman
school
teaching
and
the
ends
which
it
was
to
serve
utilitarian
to
the
backbone
the
ordinary
roman
like
the
ordinary
british
parent
wanted
his
son
to
get
on
in
life
it
was
only
the
parent
of
a
higher
class
who
sacrificed
anything
to
the
muses
and
then
chiefly
because
in
a
public
career
it
was
that
the
boy
should
not
be
ignorant
or
boorish
when
the
son
of
parents
had
mastered
the
necessary
elements
he
was
advanced
to
the
higher
type
of
school
kept
by
a
and
there
made
his
first
real
acquaintance
with
literature
and
this
was
henceforward
until
he
began
to
study
rhetoric
and
philosophy
the
staple
of
his
work
we
may
note
by
the
way
that
science
the
higher
mathematics
and
astronomy
was
reckoned
under
the
head
of
philosophy
while
medicine
and
jurisprudence
had
become
professional
studies
to
learn
which
it
was
necessary
to
attach
yourself
to
an
experienced
practitioner
as
with
the
art
of
war
in
the
grammar
schools
as
we
may
call
them
the
course
was
purely
literary
and
humanistic
and
it
was
conducted
both
in
greek
and
latin
but
chiefly
in
greek
as
a
natural
result
of
the
comparative
scantiness
of
latin
literature
homer
hesiod
and
menander
were
the
favourite
authors
studied
only
later
on
after
the
full
bloom
of
the
augustan
literature
did
latin
poets
especially
virgil
and
horace
take
a
place
of
almost
equal
importance
the
study
of
the
greek
poets
was
apparently
a
thorough
one
it
included
the
teaching
of
language
grammar
metre
style
and
subject
matter
and
was
aided
by
reading
aloud
which
was
reckoned
of
great
importance
and
learning
by
heart
on
the
part
of
the
pupils
in
the
discussion
of
the
subject
matter
any
amount
of
comment
was
freely
allowed
to
the
master
who
indeed
was
expected
to
have
at
his
fingers
ends
explanations
of
all
sorts
of
allusions
and
thus
to
enable
the
boys
to
pick
up
a
great
deal
of
odd
knowledge
and
a
certain
amount
of
history
mixed
up
of
course
with
a
large
percentage
of
valueless
mythology
in
grammaticis
says
cicero
poetarum
pertractatio
historiarum
cognitio
verborum
interpretatio
pronuntiandi
quidam
sonus
the
method
if
such
it
can
be
called
was
not
at
all
unlike
that
pursued
in
our
own
public
schools
eton
for
example
before
new
methods
and
subjects
came
in
its
great
defect
in
each
case
was
that
it
gave
but
little
opportunity
for
learning
to
distinguish
fact
from
fancy
or
acquiring
that
scientific
habit
of
mind
which
is
now
becoming
essential
for
success
in
all
departments
of
life
and
which
at
rome
was
so
rare
that
it
seems
audacious
to
claim
it
even
for
such
a
man
of
action
as
caesar
or
for
such
a
man
of
letters
as
varro
in
england
this
defect
was
compensated
to
some
extent
by
the
manly
tone
of
school
life
but
at
rome
that
side
of
school
education
was
wanting
and
the
result
was
a
want
of
solidity
both
intellectual
and
moral
the
one
saving
feature
given
a
really
good
and
teacher
might
be
the
appeal
to
the
example
of
the
great
and
good
men
of
the
past
both
greek
and
roman
and
the
study
of
their
motives
in
action
in
good
fortune
and
ill
this
is
the
kind
of
teaching
which
we
find
illustrated
in
the
book
of
valerius
maximus
which
has
already
been
alluded
to
who
takes
some
special
virtue
or
fine
quality
as
the
subject
of
most
of
his
chapters
fortitudo
patientia
abstinentia
moderatio
pietas
erga
parentes
amicitia
and
so
on
and
illustrates
them
by
examples
and
stories
drawn
mainly
from
roman
history
partly
also
from
greek
this
kind
of
appeal
to
the
young
mind
was
undoubtedly
good
and
the
finest
product
of
the
method
is
the
immortal
work
of
plutarch
the
lives
of
the
great
men
of
greece
and
rome
drawn
up
for
ethical
rather
than
historical
purposes
but
here
again
we
must
note
a
serious
drawback
any
one
who
turns
over
the
pages
of
valerius
will
see
that
these
stories
of
the
great
men
of
the
past
are
so
detached
from
their
historical
surroundings
that
they
could
not
possibly
serve
as
helps
in
the
practical
conduct
of
life
they
might
indeed
do
positive
mischief
by
leading
a
shallow
reasoner
to
suppose
that
what
may
have
been
justifiable
at
one
time
and
under
certain
circumstances
regicide
for
example
or
exposure
of
oneself
in
battle
is
justifiable
at
all
times
and
in
all
circumstances
such
an
appeal
failed
also
by
discouraging
the
habit
of
thinking
about
the
facts
and
problems
of
the
day
and
men
like
cicero
and
cato
the
younger
both
suffered
from
this
weakness
of
a
purely
literary
early
training
another
drawback
is
that
this
teaching
inevitably
exaggerated
the
personal
element
in
history
at
the
very
time
too
when
personalities
were
claiming
more
than
their
due
share
of
the
attention
and
thus
the
great
lessons
which
polybius
had
tried
to
teach
the
world
of
seeking
for
causes
in
historical
investigation
and
of
meditating
on
the
phenomena
of
the
world
you
live
in
were
passed
over
or
forgotten
but
so
far
as
the
study
of
language
of
artistic
diction
of
elocution
and
intelligent
reading
could
help
a
boy
to
prepare
himself
for
life
this
education
was
good
more
especially
good
as
laying
a
foundation
for
the
acquirement
of
that
art
of
oratory
which
from
old
cato
time
onwards
had
been
the
chief
end
to
be
aimed
at
by
all
intending
to
take
part
in
public
life
cato
indeed
had
well
said
to
his
son
orator
est
marce
fili
vir
bonus
dicendi
peritus
thus
putting
the
ethical
stamp
of
the
man
in
the
first
place
and
his
rem
tene
verba
sequentur
is
a
valuable
bit
of
advice
for
all
learners
and
teachers
of
literature
but
more
and
more
the
end
of
all
education
had
come
to
be
the
art
of
oratory
and
particularly
the
art
as
exercised
in
the
courts
of
law
where
in
cicero
time
neither
truth
nor
fact
was
supreme
and
where
the
first
thing
required
was
to
be
a
clever
speaker
a
vir
bonus
by
all
means
if
you
were
so
disposed
but
to
this
we
shall
return
directly
in
such
schools
if
he
were
not
educated
at
home
the
boy
remained
till
he
was
invested
with
the
toga
virilis
or
pura
in
the
late
republic
this
usually
took
place
between
the
fourteenth
and
seventeenth
years
thus
the
two
young
ciceros
seem
both
to
have
been
sixteen
when
they
received
the
toga
virilis
while
octavian
and
virgil
were
just
fifteen
and
the
son
of
antony
only
fourteen
in
former
times
it
seems
probable
that
the
boy
remained
praetextatus
till
he
was
seventeen
the
age
at
which
he
was
legally
capable
of
military
service
and
that
he
went
straight
from
the
home
to
the
levy
in
case
of
severe
military
pressure
or
if
he
wished
it
himself
he
might
begin
his
first
military
exercises
and
even
his
active
service
in
the
praetexta
but
as
in
so
many
other
ways
so
here
the
life
of
the
city
brought
about
a
change
in
a
city
boys
are
apt
to
develop
more
rapidly
in
intelligence
if
not
in
body
and
as
the
toga
virilis
was
the
mark
of
legal
qualification
as
a
man
they
might
be
of
more
use
to
the
family
in
the
absence
of
the
father
if
invested
with
it
somewhat
earlier
than
had
been
the
primitive
custom
but
there
was
no
hard
and
fast
rule
boys
develop
with
much
variation
both
mentally
and
physically
and
like
the
eton
collar
of
our
own
schoolboys
the
toga
of
childhood
might
be
retained
or
dropped
entirely
at
the
discretion
of
the
parents
there
is
however
a
great
difference
in
the
two
cases
in
regard
to
the
assumption
of
the
manly
dress
with
us
it
does
not
mean
independence
as
a
rule
the
boy
remains
at
school
for
a
year
or
two
at
least
under
strict
discipline
at
rome
it
meant
on
the
contrary
that
he
was
of
age
and
in
the
eye
of
the
law
a
man
capable
of
looking
after
his
own
education
and
of
holding
property
this
was
a
survival
from
the
time
when
at
the
age
of
puberty
the
boy
as
among
all
primitive
peoples
was
solemnly
received
into
the
body
of
citizens
and
warriors
and
the
solemnity
of
the
roman
ceremony
fully
attests
this
after
a
sacrifice
in
the
house
and
the
dedication
of
his
boyish
toga
and
bulla
to
the
lar
familiaris
he
was
invested
with
the
plain
toga
of
manhood
libera
pura
and
conducted
by
his
father
or
guardian
accompanied
in
characteristic
roman
fashion
see
below
by
friends
and
relations
to
the
forum
and
probably
also
to
the
tabularium
under
the
capitol
where
his
name
was
entered
in
the
list
of
full
citizens
with
the
new
arrangement
under
which
boys
might
become
legally
men
at
an
earlier
age
than
in
the
old
days
it
is
obvious
that
there
must
often
have
been
an
interval
before
they
were
physically
or
mentally
qualified
for
a
profession
as
the
sole
civil
profession
to
which
boys
of
high
family
would
aspire
was
that
of
the
bar
a
father
would
send
his
son
during
that
interval
to
a
distinguished
advocate
to
be
taken
as
a
pupil
cicero
himself
was
thus
apprenticed
to
mucius
scaevola
the
augur
and
in
the
same
way
the
young
caelius
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
his
toga
virilis
was
brought
by
his
father
to
cicero
the
relation
between
the
youth
and
his
preceptor
was
not
unlike
that
of
the
in
military
life
in
which
the
general
to
whom
a
lad
was
committed
was
supposed
to
be
responsible
for
his
welfare
and
conduct
as
well
as
for
his
education
in
the
art
of
war
thus
cicero
says
of
caelius
that
at
that
period
of
his
life
no
one
ever
saw
him
except
with
his
father
or
with
me
or
in
the
very
house
of
crassus
who
shared
with
cicero
in
the
guardianship
fuit
assiduus
mecum
he
says
a
little
farther
on
this
kind
of
pupilage
was
called
the
in
which
a
lad
should
be
pursuing
his
studies
for
the
legal
profession
and
also
his
bodily
exercises
in
the
campus
martius
so
that
he
might
be
ready
to
serve
in
the
army
for
the
single
campaign
which
was
still
desirable
if
not
absolutely
necessary
when
he
had
made
his
first
speech
in
a
court
of
law
he
was
said
and
if
it
were
a
success
he
might
devote
himself
more
particularly
henceforward
to
the
art
and
practice
of
oratory
no
doubt
all
really
ambitious
young
men
who
aimed
at
high
office
and
an
eventual
provincial
government
would
like
caesar
endeavour
to
qualify
themselves
for
the
army
as
well
as
the
forum
cicero
however
whose
instincts
were
not
military
served
only
in
one
campaign
at
the
age
of
seventeen
and
apparently
he
advised
caelius
to
do
no
more
than
this
caelius
served
under
pompeius
proconsul
of
africa
to
whom
he
was
attached
as
choosing
this
province
because
his
father
had
estates
there
it
was
only
on
his
return
with
a
good
character
from
pompeius
that
he
proceeded
to
exhibit
his
skill
as
an
orator
by
accusing
some
distinguished
person
in
this
case
the
antonius
who
was
afterwards
consul
with
cicero
to
attain
the
skill
in
oratory
which
would
enable
the
pupil
to
make
a
successful
appearance
in
the
forum
he
must
have
gone
through
an
elaborate
training
in
the
art
of
rhetoric
cicero
does
not
tell
us
whether
he
himself
gave
caelius
lessons
in
rhetoric
or
whether
he
sent
him
to
a
professional
teacher
he
had
himself
written
a
treatise
on
a
part
of
the
subject
the
of
the
earliest
of
all
his
prose
works
and
was
therefore
quite
able
to
give
the
necessary
instruction
if
he
found
time
to
do
so
it
is
not
the
object
of
this
chapter
to
explain
the
meaning
of
rhetoric
as
the
world
then
understood
it
or
the
theory
of
a
rhetorical
education
for
this
the
reader
must
be
referred
to
professor
wilkins
little
book
or
better
still
to
the
main
source
of
our
knowledge
the
of
quintilian
something
may
however
be
said
here
of
the
view
taken
of
a
rhetorical
training
by
cicero
himself
very
clearly
expressed
in
the
exordium
of
the
treatise
just
mentioned
and
often
more
or
less
directly
reiterated
in
his
later
and
more
mature
works
on
oratory
after
much
meditation
he
says
i
have
been
led
to
the
conclusion
that
wisdom
without
eloquence
is
of
little
use
to
a
state
while
eloquence
without
wisdom
is
often
positively
harmful
and
never
of
any
value
thus
if
a
man
abandoning
the
study
of
reason
and
duty
which
is
always
perfectly
straight
and
honourable
spends
his
whole
time
in
the
practice
of
speaking
he
is
being
brought
up
to
be
a
hindrance
to
his
own
development
and
a
dangerous
citizen
this
reminds
us
of
cato
saying
that
an
orator
is
vir
bonus
dicendi
peritus
less
strongly
expressed
the
same
view
is
also
found
in
the
exordium
of
another
and
more
mature
treatise
on
rhetoric
by
an
author
whose
name
is
unknown
written
a
year
or
two
before
that
of
cicero
non
enim
parum
in
se
fructus
habet
copia
dicendi
et
commoditas
orationis
si
recta
intelligentia
et
definita
animi
moderatione
gubernetur
we
may
assume
that
in
cicero
early
years
the
best
men
felt
that
the
rhetorical
art
if
it
were
to
be
of
real
value
to
the
individual
and
the
state
must
be
used
with
discretion
and
accompanied
by
high
aims
and
upright
conduct
yet
within
a
generation
of
the
date
when
these
wise
words
were
written
the
letters
of
caelius
show
us
that
the
art
was
used
utterly
without
discretion
and
to
the
detriment
both
of
state
and
individual
the
high
ideal
of
culture
and
conduct
had
been
lost
in
the
actual
practice
of
oratory
in
a
degenerate
age
full
of
petty
ambitions
and
animosities
we
ourselves
know
only
too
well
how
a
thing
good
in
itself
as
a
means
is
apt
to
lose
its
value
if
raised
into
the
place
of
an
end
how
the
young
mind
is
apt
to
elevate
cricket
football
golf
into
the
main
object
of
all
human
activity
so
it
was
with
rhetoric
it
was
the
indispensable
acquirement
to
enable
a
man
to
enjoy
thoroughly
the
game
in
the
forum
and
thus
in
education
it
became
the
staple
commodity
the
actual
process
of
acquiring
it
was
no
doubt
an
excellent
intellectual
exercise
the
learning
rules
of
composition
the
exercises
in
applying
these
rules
the
writing
of
themes
or
essays
proposita
communes
loci
in
which
the
pupil
had
to
find
and
arrange
his
own
facts
and
then
the
declamatio
or
exercise
in
actual
speaking
on
a
given
subject
which
in
cicero
day
was
called
causa
and
was
later
known
as
controversia
such
practice
must
have
brought
out
much
talent
and
ingenuity
like
that
of
our
own
debating
societies
at
school
and
college
but
there
were
two
great
defects
in
it
first
as
professor
wilkins
points
out
the
subjects
of
declamation
were
too
often
out
of
all
relation
to
real
life
taken
from
the
greek
mythology
or
if
less
barren
than
usual
were
far
more
commonplace
and
flat
than
those
of
our
debating
societies
to
harangue
on
the
question
whether
the
life
of
a
lawyer
or
a
soldier
is
the
best
is
hardly
so
inspiring
as
to
debate
a
question
of
the
day
about
ireland
or
india
which
educates
in
living
fact
as
well
as
in
the
rules
of
the
orator
art
secondly
the
whole
aim
and
object
of
this
finishing
portion
of
a
boy
education
was
a
false
one
even
the
excellent
quintilian
the
best
of
all
roman
teachers
believed
that
the
statesman
civilis
vir
and
the
orator
are
identical
that
the
statesman
must
be
vir
bonus
because
the
vir
bonus
makes
the
best
orator
that
he
should
be
sapiens
for
the
same
reason
and
the
object
of
oratory
is
id
agere
ut
iudici
quae
proposita
fuerint
vera
et
honesta
the
object
is
not
truth
but
persuasion
we
might
get
an
idea
of
how
such
a
training
would
fail
in
forming
character
if
we
could
imagine
all
our
liberal
education
subordinated
to
the
practice
of
journalism
but
fortunately
for
us
in
this
scientific
age
words
and
the
use
of
words
no
longer
serve
as
the
basis
of
education
or
as
the
chief
nurture
of
young
life
we
need
to
see
facts
to
understand
causes
to
distinguish
objective
truth
from
truth
reflected
in
books
but
the
perfect
education
must
be
a
skilful
mingling
of
the
two
methods
and
it
may
be
as
well
to
take
care
that
we
do
not
lose
contact
with
the
best
thoughts
of
the
best
men
because
they
are
contained
in
the
literature
we
show
some
signs
of
neglecting
we
may
say
of
science
what
cicero
said
of
rhetoric
that
it
can
not
do
without
sapientia
of
schools
of
philosophy
i
have
already
said
something
in
the
last
chapter
and
as
the
study
of
philosophy
was
hardly
a
part
of
the
regular
curriculum
of
education
properly
so
called
i
shall
pass
it
over
here
the
philosopher
was
usually
to
be
found
in
wealthy
houses
and
if
he
were
a
wholesome
person
and
not
a
philodemus
he
might
assuredly
exercise
a
good
influence
on
a
young
man
or
a
youth
might
go
to
athens
or
rhodes
or
to
some
other
greek
city
to
attend
the
lectures
of
some
famous
professor
cicero
heard
phaedrus
the
epicurean
at
rome
and
then
philo
the
academician
who
had
a
lasting
influence
on
his
pupil
and
then
at
the
age
of
went
to
greece
for
two
years
studying
at
athens
rhodes
and
elsewhere
caesar
also
went
to
rhodes
and
he
and
cicero
both
attended
the
lectures
of
molo
in
rhetoric
in
which
study
as
well
as
in
philosophy
lectures
were
to
be
heard
in
all
the
great
greek
cities
cicero
sent
his
own
son
to
the
university
in
athens
at
the
age
of
twenty
giving
him
an
ample
allowance
and
doubtless
much
good
advice
the
young
man
soon
outran
his
allowance
and
got
into
debt
the
good
advice
he
seems
to
have
failed
to
utilise
and
in
fact
gave
his
father
considerable
anxiety
the
following
letter
which
seems
to
show
that
a
youth
who
had
excellent
opportunities
might
still
be
lacking
in
principle
and
is
the
only
one
which
survives
of
the
letters
of
undergraduates
of
that
day
it
was
written
by
the
young
cicero
after
he
had
repented
and
undertaken
to
reform
not
to
his
father
himself
but
to
the
faithful
friend
and
freedman
of
his
father
tiro
who
afterwards
edited
the
collection
of
letters
in
which
he
inserted
it
it
is
on
the
whole
a
pleasing
letter
and
seems
to
show
real
affection
for
tiro
who
had
known
the
writer
from
his
infancy
it
is
a
little
odd
in
the
choice
of
words
perhaps
a
trifle
rhetorical
the
reader
shall
be
left
to
decide
for
himself
whether
it
is
perfectly
straight
and
genuine
in
any
case
it
may
aptly
conclude
this
chapter
i
had
been
anxiously
expecting
day
after
day
when
at
last
they
arrived
days
after
they
left
you
their
arrival
was
most
welcome
to
me
i
took
the
greatest
possible
pleasure
in
the
letter
of
the
kindest
and
best
beloved
of
fathers
but
your
own
delightful
letter
put
the
finishing
touch
to
my
joy
so
i
no
longer
repent
of
dropping
for
a
time
but
am
rather
glad
i
did
so
for
my
silence
has
brought
me
a
great
reward
in
your
kindness
i
am
very
glad
indeed
that
you
accepted
my
excuse
without
hesitation
i
am
sure
my
dearest
tiro
that
the
reports
about
me
which
reach
you
answer
your
best
wishes
and
hopes
i
will
make
them
good
and
i
will
do
my
best
that
this
beginning
of
a
good
report
about
me
may
daily
be
repeated
so
you
may
with
perfect
confidence
fulfil
your
promise
of
being
the
trumpeter
buccinator
of
my
reputation
for
the
errors
of
my
youth
have
caused
me
so
much
remorse
and
suffering
that
it
is
not
only
my
heart
that
shrinks
from
what
i
did
my
very
ears
abhor
the
mention
of
it
i
know
for
a
fact
that
you
have
shared
my
trouble
and
sorrow
and
i
do
wonder
you
always
wished
me
to
do
well
not
only
for
my
sake
but
for
your
own
so
as
i
have
been
the
means
of
giving
you
pain
i
will
now
take
care
that
you
shall
feel
double
joy
on
my
account
let
me
tell
you
that
my
attachment
to
cratippus
is
that
of
a
son
rather
than
a
pupil
i
enjoy
his
lectures
but
i
am
especially
charmed
by
his
delightful
manners
i
spend
whole
days
with
him
and
often
part
of
the
night
for
i
get
him
to
dine
with
me
as
often
as
i
can
we
have
grown
so
intimate
that
he
often
drops
in
upon
us
unexpectedly
while
we
are
at
dinner
lays
aside
the
stiff
air
of
a
philosopher
and
joins
in
our
jests
with
the
greatest
good
will
he
is
such
a
man
so
delightful
so
distinguished
that
you
ought
to
make
his
acquaintance
as
soon
as
ever
you
can
as
for
bruttius
i
never
let
him
leave
me
he
is
a
man
of
strict
and
moral
life
as
well
as
being
the
most
delightful
company
surely
it
is
not
necessary
that
in
our
daily
literary
studies
there
should
never
be
any
fun
at
all
i
have
taken
a
lodging
close
to
him
and
as
far
as
i
can
with
my
pittance
i
subsidise
his
narrow
means
i
have
also
begun
practising
declamation
in
greek
with
cassius
in
latin
i
like
having
my
practice
with
bruttius
my
intimate
friends
and
daily
company
are
those
whom
cratippus
brought
with
him
from
mitylene
good
scholars
of
whom
he
has
the
highest
opinion
i
also
see
a
great
deal
of
epicrates
the
leading
man
at
athens
and
leonides
and
people
of
that
sort
so
now
you
know
how
i
am
going
on
you
say
something
in
your
letter
about
gorgias
the
fact
is
that
i
found
him
very
useful
in
my
daily
practice
of
declamation
but
i
put
my
father
injunctions
before
everything
else
and
he
had
written
telling
me
to
give
up
gorgias
at
once
i
would
about
it
for
fear
my
making
a
fuss
might
put
some
suspicion
in
my
head
moreover
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
would
be
offensive
for
me
to
express
an
opinion
on
a
decision
of
my
father
however
your
interest
and
advice
are
welcome
and
acceptable
your
apology
for
want
of
time
i
readily
accept
for
i
know
how
busy
you
always
are
i
am
very
glad
you
have
bought
an
estate
and
you
have
my
best
wishes
for
the
success
of
your
purchase
do
be
surprised
at
my
congratulations
coming
at
this
point
in
my
letter
for
it
was
at
the
corresponding
point
in
yours
that
you
told
me
of
this
you
must
drop
your
city
manners
urbanitates
you
are
a
romanus
how
clearly
i
see
your
dearest
face
before
me
at
this
moment
i
seem
to
see
you
buying
things
for
the
farm
talking
to
your
bailiff
saving
the
seeds
at
dessert
in
your
cloak
but
as
to
the
matter
of
money
i
am
sorry
i
was
not
there
to
help
you
do
doubt
my
dear
tiro
about
my
helping
you
in
the
future
if
fortune
will
but
stand
by
me
especially
as
i
know
that
this
estate
has
been
bought
for
our
mutual
advantage
as
to
my
commissions
about
which
you
are
taking
trouble
many
thanks
i
beg
you
to
send
me
a
secretary
at
the
first
opportunity
if
possible
a
greek
for
he
will
save
me
much
trouble
in
copying
out
notes
above
all
take
care
of
your
health
that
we
may
have
some
literary
talk
together
some
day
i
commend
anteros
to
you
adieu
chapter
vii
the
slave
population
in
the
last
age
of
the
republic
the
employment
of
slave
labour
reached
its
mark
in
ancient
history
we
have
already
met
with
evidence
of
this
in
examining
the
life
of
the
upper
classes
in
the
present
chapter
we
must
try
to
sketch
first
the
conditions
under
which
it
was
possible
for
such
a
vast
slave
system
to
arise
and
flourish
and
secondly
the
economical
and
ethical
results
of
it
both
in
city
and
country
the
subject
is
indeed
far
too
large
and
complicated
to
be
treated
in
a
single
short
chapter
but
our
object
throughout
this
book
is
only
to
give
such
a
picture
of
society
in
general
as
may
tempt
a
student
to
further
and
more
exact
inquiry
we
have
seen
that
the
two
upper
classes
of
society
were
engaged
in
business
of
various
kinds
and
especially
in
banking
and
carrying
out
public
contracts
or
in
the
work
of
government
and
in
italian
agriculture
all
this
business
public
and
private
called
for
a
vast
amount
of
labor
and
in
part
of
skilled
labour
the
great
men
provided
the
capital
but
the
details
of
the
work
as
it
had
gradually
developed
since
the
war
with
hannibal
created
a
demand
for
workmen
of
every
kind
such
as
had
never
before
been
known
in
the
world
clerks
accountants
messengers
as
well
as
operatives
were
wanted
both
by
the
government
and
by
private
capitalists
in
the
households
of
the
rich
the
great
increase
of
wealth
and
luxury
had
led
to
a
constant
demand
for
helps
of
all
kinds
each
with
a
certain
amount
of
skill
in
his
own
particular
department
and
on
the
estates
in
the
country
which
were
steadily
growing
bigger
and
were
tending
to
be
worked
more
and
more
on
capitalistic
lines
labour
both
skilled
and
unskilled
was
increasingly
required
thus
the
demand
for
labour
was
abnormally
great
and
had
been
created
with
abnormal
rapidity
and
the
supply
could
not
possibly
be
provided
by
the
free
population
alone
the
lower
classes
of
city
and
country
were
not
suited
to
the
work
wanted
either
by
capacity
or
inclination
it
was
not
for
a
free
roman
to
be
at
the
beck
and
call
of
an
employer
like
the
clerks
and
underlings
of
or
to
act
as
servant
in
a
great
household
and
for
a
great
part
of
the
necessary
work
he
was
not
sufficiently
well
educated
far
less
was
it
possible
for
him
to
work
on
the
great
and
the
state
wanted
the
best
years
of
his
life
for
service
in
the
army
which
as
has
been
well
remarked
was
the
real
industry
of
the
roman
freeman
but
luckily
in
one
sense
and
in
another
unluckily
for
rome
there
was
an
endless
supply
of
labour
to
be
had
of
every
quality
and
capacity
for
the
very
same
abnormal
circumstances
which
had
created
the
demand
also
provided
the
supply
the
great
wars
and
the
wealth
accruing
from
them
in
various
ways
had
produced
a
capitalist
class
in
need
of
labour
and
also
created
a
on
a
scale
such
as
the
world
has
never
known
before
or
since
ever
since
the
time
of
alexander
and
the
wars
of
his
successors
with
each
other
and
their
neighbours
it
is
probable
that
the
supply
of
captives
sold
as
slaves
had
been
increasing
and
in
the
second
century
the
little
island
of
delos
had
come
to
be
used
as
a
convenient
centre
for
the
slave
trade
strabo
tells
us
in
a
passage
that
slaves
might
be
sold
there
in
a
single
day
but
rome
herself
was
in
the
time
of
cicero
the
great
emporium
for
slaves
the
wars
which
were
most
productive
of
prisoners
had
been
for
long
in
the
centre
and
the
west
of
the
mediterranean
basin
all
armies
sent
out
from
rome
were
accompanied
by
speculators
in
this
trade
who
bought
the
captives
as
they
were
put
up
to
auction
after
a
battle
and
then
undertook
the
transport
to
rome
of
all
who
were
suited
for
employment
in
italy
or
were
not
bought
up
in
the
province
which
was
the
seat
of
war
the
enormous
number
of
slaves
thus
made
available
even
if
we
make
allowance
for
the
uncertainty
of
the
numbers
as
they
have
come
down
to
us
surpasses
all
belief
we
may
take
a
few
examples
sufficient
to
give
some
idea
of
a
practice
which
had
lasting
and
lamentable
results
on
roman
society
after
the
campaign
of
pydna
and
the
overthrow
of
the
macedonian
kingdom
aemilius
paullus
one
of
the
most
humane
of
romans
sold
into
slavery
under
orders
from
the
senate
free
inhabitants
of
communities
in
epirus
which
had
sided
with
perseus
in
the
war
after
the
war
with
the
cimbri
and
teutones
of
the
latter
and
of
the
former
are
said
to
have
been
sold
and
though
the
numbers
may
be
open
to
suspicion
as
they
amount
again
to
the
fact
of
an
enormous
capture
is
beyond
question
caesar
like
aemilius
paullus
one
of
the
most
humane
of
romans
tells
us
himself
that
on
a
single
occasion
the
capture
of
the
aduatuci
he
sold
prisoners
on
the
spot
and
of
course
every
war
whether
great
or
small
while
it
diminished
the
free
population
by
slaughter
pestilence
or
capture
added
to
the
number
of
slaves
cicero
himself
after
his
campaign
in
cilicia
and
the
capture
of
the
hill
stronghold
pindonissus
did
of
course
as
all
other
commanders
did
we
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
process
in
a
letter
to
atticus
mancipia
venibant
saturnalibus
tertiis
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
point
out
that
we
should
be
getting
our
historical
perspective
quite
wrong
if
we
allowed
ourselves
to
expect
in
these
cultured
roman
generals
any
sign
of
compassion
for
their
victims
it
was
a
part
of
their
mental
inheritance
to
look
on
men
who
had
surrendered
as
simply
booty
the
property
of
the
victors
roman
captives
would
meet
with
the
same
fate
and
even
for
them
little
pity
was
ever
felt
when
caesar
in
within
a
few
months
dismissed
two
surrendered
armies
of
roman
soldiers
once
at
corfinium
and
again
in
spain
he
was
doubtless
acting
from
motives
of
policy
but
the
enslavement
of
roman
citizens
by
their
fellows
would
we
may
hope
have
been
repugnant
to
him
if
not
to
his
own
soldiers
war
then
was
the
principal
source
of
the
supply
of
slaves
but
it
was
not
the
only
one
when
a
is
in
full
swing
it
will
be
fostered
in
all
possible
ways
brigandage
and
kidnapping
were
rife
all
over
the
empire
and
in
the
countries
beyond
its
borders
in
the
disturbed
times
with
which
we
are
dealing
the
pirates
of
cilicia
until
they
were
suppressed
by
pompeius
in
swarmed
all
over
the
mediterranean
and
snapped
up
victims
by
raids
even
on
the
coasts
of
italy
selling
them
in
the
market
at
delos
without
hindrance
cicero
in
his
speech
in
support
of
the
appointment
of
pompey
mentions
that
children
had
been
carried
off
from
misenum
under
the
very
eyes
of
a
roman
praetor
caesar
himself
was
taken
by
them
when
a
young
man
and
only
escaped
with
difficulty
in
italy
itself
where
there
was
no
police
protection
until
augustus
took
the
matter
in
hand
kidnapping
was
by
no
means
unknown
the
as
they
were
called
often
slaves
escaped
from
the
prisons
of
the
great
estates
haunted
the
public
roads
and
many
a
traveller
disappeared
in
this
way
and
passed
the
rest
of
his
life
in
a
varro
in
describing
the
sort
of
slaves
best
suited
for
work
on
the
great
says
that
they
should
be
such
as
are
strong
enough
to
defend
the
flocks
from
wild
beasts
and
brigands
the
latter
doubtless
quite
as
ready
to
seize
human
beings
as
sheep
and
cattle
and
seem
to
have
been
constantly
carrying
on
their
trade
in
regions
where
no
war
was
going
on
and
where
desirable
slaves
could
be
procured
the
kingdoms
of
asia
minor
were
ransacked
by
them
and
when
marius
asked
nicomedes
king
of
bithynia
for
soldiers
during
the
struggle
with
the
cimbri
the
answer
he
got
was
that
there
were
none
to
send
the
had
been
at
work
there
every
one
will
remember
the
line
of
horace
in
which
he
calls
one
of
these
wretches
a
king
of
cappadocia
there
were
two
other
sources
of
the
slave
supply
of
which
however
little
need
be
said
here
as
the
contribution
they
made
was
comparatively
small
first
slaves
were
bred
from
slaves
and
on
rural
estates
this
was
frequently
done
as
a
matter
of
business
varro
recommends
the
practice
in
the
large
under
certain
conditions
and
some
lines
of
horace
suggest
that
on
smaller
farms
where
a
better
class
of
slaves
would
be
required
these
ones
were
looked
on
as
the
mark
of
a
rich
house
ditis
examen
domus
secondly
a
certain
number
of
slaves
had
become
such
under
the
law
of
debt
this
was
a
common
source
of
slavery
in
the
early
periods
of
roman
history
but
in
cicero
day
we
can
not
speak
of
it
with
confidence
we
have
noticed
the
cry
of
the
distressed
freemen
of
the
city
in
the
conspiracy
of
catiline
which
looks
as
though
the
old
law
were
still
put
in
force
and
in
the
country
there
are
signs
that
small
owners
who
had
borrowed
from
large
ones
were
in
time
in
some
modified
condition
of
slavery
surrendering
their
labour
in
lieu
of
payment
but
all
these
internal
sources
of
slavery
are
as
nothing
compared
with
the
supply
created
by
war
and
the
this
supply
being
thus
practically
unlimited
prices
ran
comparatively
low
and
no
roman
of
any
considerable
means
at
all
need
be
or
was
entirely
without
slaves
he
had
only
to
go
or
to
send
his
agent
to
one
of
the
city
such
as
the
temple
of
castor
where
the
mangones
exhibited
their
goods
under
the
supervision
of
the
aediles
there
he
could
pick
out
exactly
the
kind
of
slave
he
wanted
at
any
price
from
the
equivalent
of
upwards
the
unfortunate
human
being
was
exhibited
exactly
as
horses
are
now
and
could
be
stripped
handled
trotted
about
and
treated
with
every
kind
of
indignity
and
of
course
the
same
sort
of
trickery
went
on
in
these
human
sales
as
is
familiar
to
all
of
the
present
day
the
buyer
if
he
wanted
a
valuable
article
a
greek
for
example
who
could
act
as
secretary
or
librarian
like
beloved
tiro
or
even
a
household
slave
with
a
special
character
for
skill
in
cooking
or
other
specialised
work
of
a
luxurious
family
would
have
to
give
a
high
price
even
as
long
ago
as
the
time
of
the
elder
cato
a
very
large
sum
might
be
given
for
a
single
choice
slave
and
cato
as
censor
in
attempted
to
check
such
high
prices
by
increasing
the
duties
payable
on
the
sales
towards
the
close
of
the
republican
period
we
have
little
explicit
evidence
of
prices
cicero
constantly
mentions
his
slaves
but
not
their
values
doubtless
for
fancy
articles
huge
prices
might
be
demanded
pliny
tells
us
that
antony
when
triumvir
bought
two
boys
as
twins
for
more
than
apiece
who
were
no
doubt
intended
for
handsome
pages
perhaps
to
please
cleopatra
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
ordinary
slaves
capable
of
performing
only
menial
offices
in
town
or
country
were
to
be
had
at
this
time
quite
cheap
and
the
number
in
the
city
alone
must
have
been
very
great
it
is
unfortunately
quite
impossible
to
make
even
a
probable
estimate
of
the
total
number
in
rome
the
data
are
not
forthcoming
beloch
remarks
aptly
that
though
some
families
owned
hundreds
of
slaves
the
number
of
such
families
was
not
large
quoting
the
words
of
philippus
tribune
in
to
the
effect
that
there
were
not
more
than
two
thousand
persons
of
any
substance
in
the
state
the
great
majority
of
citizens
living
in
rome
had
he
thinks
no
slaves
he
is
forced
to
take
as
a
basis
of
calculation
the
proportion
of
bond
to
free
in
the
only
city
of
the
empire
about
which
we
have
certain
information
on
this
point
at
pergamum
there
was
one
slave
to
two
free
persons
assuming
the
whole
free
population
to
have
been
about
half
a
million
in
the
time
of
augustus
or
rather
more
including
peregrini
he
thus
arrives
at
a
slave
population
of
something
like
this
may
not
be
far
off
the
mark
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
it
is
little
more
than
a
guess
what
has
been
said
above
will
have
given
the
reader
some
idea
of
the
conditions
of
life
which
created
a
great
demand
for
labour
in
the
last
two
centuries
and
of
the
circumstances
which
produced
an
abundant
supply
of
unfree
labour
to
satisfy
that
demand
i
propose
now
to
treat
the
whole
question
of
roman
slavery
from
three
points
of
view
the
economic
the
legal
and
the
ethical
in
other
words
we
have
to
ask
how
the
abundance
of
slave
labour
affected
the
social
economy
of
the
free
population
what
was
the
position
of
the
slave
in
the
eye
of
the
law
as
regards
treatment
and
chance
of
manumission
what
were
the
ethical
results
of
this
great
slave
system
both
on
the
slaves
themselves
and
on
their
masters
from
an
economical
point
of
view
the
most
interesting
question
is
whether
slave
labour
seriously
interfered
with
the
development
of
free
industry
and
unfortunately
this
question
is
an
extremely
difficult
one
to
answer
we
can
all
guess
easily
that
the
opportunities
of
free
labour
must
have
been
limited
by
the
presence
of
enormous
numbers
of
slaves
but
to
get
at
the
facts
is
another
matter
in
regard
to
rural
slavery
we
have
some
evidence
to
go
upon
as
we
shall
see
directly
and
this
has
of
late
been
collected
and
utilised
but
as
regards
labour
in
the
city
no
such
research
has
as
yet
been
made
and
the
material
is
at
once
less
fruitful
and
more
difficult
to
handle
a
few
words
on
this
last
point
must
suffice
here
we
have
seen
in
chapter
ii
that
there
was
plenty
of
employment
at
rome
for
freemen
friedl√§nder
than
whom
no
higher
authority
can
be
quoted
for
the
social
life
of
the
city
goes
so
far
as
to
assert
that
even
under
the
early
empire
a
freeman
could
always
obtain
work
if
he
wished
for
it
and
even
if
we
take
this
as
a
somewhat
exaggerated
statement
it
may
serve
to
keep
us
from
rushing
to
the
other
extreme
and
picturing
a
population
of
idle
free
paupers
in
fact
we
are
bound
on
general
evidence
to
assume
for
our
own
period
that
he
is
in
the
main
right
the
poor
freeman
of
rome
had
to
live
somehow
and
the
cheap
corn
which
he
enjoyed
was
not
given
him
gratis
until
a
few
years
before
the
republic
came
to
an
end
how
did
he
get
the
money
to
pay
even
the
sum
of
six
asses
and
a
third
for
a
modius
of
corn
or
to
pay
for
shelter
and
clothing
which
were
assuredly
not
to
be
had
for
nothing
we
know
again
that
the
gilds
of
trades
see
above
continued
to
exist
in
the
last
century
of
the
republic
though
the
majority
had
to
be
suppressed
owing
to
their
misuse
as
political
clubs
supposing
that
the
members
of
these
collegia
were
small
employers
of
labour
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
labour
they
employed
was
at
least
largely
free
for
the
capital
needed
to
invest
at
some
risk
in
a
sufficient
number
of
slaves
who
would
have
to
be
housed
and
fed
and
whose
lives
would
be
uncertain
in
a
crowded
and
unhealthy
city
could
not
we
must
suppose
be
easily
found
by
such
men
here
and
there
no
doubt
we
find
traces
of
slave
labour
in
factories
as
far
back
as
the
time
of
plautus
if
we
can
take
him
as
writing
of
rome
rather
than
translating
from
the
greek
an
te
ibi
vis
inter
istas
versarier
prosedas
pistorum
amicas
reginas
alicarias
miseras
schoeno
delibutas
servilicolas
sordidas
foll
but
on
the
whole
we
may
with
all
due
caution
in
default
of
complete
investigation
of
the
question
assume
that
the
roman
slaves
were
confined
for
the
most
part
to
the
great
and
rich
families
and
were
not
used
by
them
to
any
great
extent
in
productive
industry
but
in
supplying
the
luxurious
needs
of
the
household
in
all
probability
research
will
show
that
free
labour
was
far
more
available
than
we
are
apt
to
think
we
hear
of
no
outbreak
of
feeling
against
slave
labour
which
might
suggest
a
rivalry
between
the
two
slave
labour
we
may
think
had
filled
a
gap
created
by
abnormal
circumstances
and
did
not
oust
free
labour
entirely
but
it
tended
constantly
to
cramp
it
and
doubtless
started
notions
of
work
in
general
which
helped
to
degrade
it
those
immense
of
which
the
historian
of
slavery
has
given
a
detailed
account
in
his
second
volume
belong
rather
to
the
early
empire
than
to
the
last
years
of
the
republic
the
evidence
for
them
is
drawn
chiefly
from
seneca
juvenal
tacitus
martial
etc
but
such
evidence
as
we
have
for
the
age
of
cicero
seems
to
suggest
that
the
vast
palaces
of
the
capitalists
which
sallust
describes
as
being
almost
like
cities
were
already
beginning
to
be
served
by
a
familia
urbana
which
rendered
them
almost
independent
of
any
aid
from
without
by
labour
or
purchase
not
only
the
ordinary
domestic
helpers
of
all
kinds
but
copyists
librarians
paedagogi
as
tutors
for
the
children
and
even
doctors
might
all
be
found
in
such
households
in
a
servile
condition
without
reckoning
the
great
numbers
who
seem
to
have
been
always
available
as
escorts
when
the
great
man
was
travelling
in
italy
or
in
the
provinces
valerius
maximus
tells
us
that
cato
the
censor
as
proconsul
of
spain
took
only
three
slaves
with
him
and
that
his
descendant
cato
of
utica
during
the
civil
wars
had
twelve
as
both
these
men
were
extremely
frugal
we
can
form
an
idea
from
this
passage
both
of
the
increasing
supply
of
slaves
and
of
the
far
larger
escorts
which
accompanied
the
ordinary
wealthy
traveller
as
regards
the
familia
rustica
the
working
population
of
the
farm
the
evidence
is
much
more
definite
the
old
roman
farm
in
which
the
paterfamilias
lived
with
his
wife
children
and
slaves
was
no
doubt
like
the
old
english
holding
in
a
manor
for
the
most
part
doing
little
in
the
way
of
sale
or
purchase
and
worked
by
all
the
members
of
the
familia
bond
and
free
in
the
middle
of
the
second
century
when
cato
wrote
his
treatise
on
husbandry
we
find
that
a
change
has
taken
place
the
master
can
only
pay
the
farm
an
occasional
visit
to
see
that
it
is
being
properly
managed
by
the
slave
steward
vilicus
and
the
business
is
being
run
upon
capitalistic
lines
with
a
view
to
realising
the
utmost
possible
profit
from
it
by
the
sale
of
its
products
thus
cato
is
most
particular
in
urging
that
a
farm
should
be
so
placed
as
to
have
easy
communication
with
market
towns
where
the
wine
and
oil
could
be
sold
which
were
the
chief
products
and
where
various
necessaries
could
be
bought
cheap
such
as
pottery
and
of
all
kinds
thus
the
farm
does
not
entirely
depend
on
the
labour
of
its
own
familia
nevertheless
it
rests
still
upon
an
economic
basis
of
slave
labour
for
an
olivetum
of
jugera
cato
puts
the
necessary
hands
as
thirteen
in
number
all
for
a
vineyard
of
jugera
at
sixteen
and
these
figures
are
no
doubt
low
if
we
remember
his
character
for
parsimony
and
free
labour
was
to
be
had
and
was
occasionally
needed
at
the
very
outset
of
his
work
cato
ch
insists
that
the
owner
should
be
a
good
and
friendly
neighbour
in
order
that
he
may
easily
obtain
not
only
voluntary
help
but
hired
labourers
operarii
these
were
needed
especially
at
harvest
time
when
extra
hands
were
wanted
as
in
our
for
the
gathering
of
olives
and
for
the
vintage
sometimes
the
work
was
let
out
to
a
contractor
and
he
gives
explicit
directions
in
chs
and
for
the
choice
of
these
and
the
contracts
to
be
made
with
them
whether
in
this
case
the
contractor
redemptor
used
entirely
free
or
slave
labour
does
not
appear
distinctly
but
it
seems
clear
that
a
proportion
at
least
was
free
what
the
free
labourers
did
at
other
times
of
the
year
whether
or
no
they
were
small
cultivators
themselves
cato
does
not
tell
us
for
the
age
with
which
we
are
more
specially
concerned
we
have
the
evidence
of
varro
three
books
on
husbandry
written
in
his
old
age
after
the
fall
of
the
republic
here
we
find
the
economic
condition
of
the
farm
little
changed
since
the
time
of
cato
the
permanent
labour
is
but
in
spite
of
the
vast
increase
in
the
servile
labour
available
in
italy
there
is
still
a
considerable
employment
of
freemen
at
certain
times
on
all
farms
where
the
olive
and
vine
were
the
chief
objects
of
culture
in
the
chapter
of
his
first
book
in
which
he
gives
interesting
advice
for
the
purchase
of
suitable
slaves
he
begins
by
telling
us
that
all
land
is
cultivated
either
by
slaves
or
freemen
or
both
together
and
the
free
are
of
three
kinds
either
small
holders
pauperculi
with
their
children
or
labourers
who
live
by
wage
conducticii
and
are
especially
needed
in
hay
harvest
or
vintage
or
debtors
who
give
their
labour
as
payment
for
what
they
owe
obaerati
varro
too
like
cato
recognises
the
necessity
of
purchasing
many
things
which
can
not
well
be
manufactured
on
a
farm
of
moderate
size
and
thus
the
landowner
may
in
this
way
also
have
been
indirectly
an
employer
of
free
labour
but
so
far
as
possible
the
farm
should
supply
itself
with
the
materials
for
its
own
working
for
this
gives
employment
to
the
slaves
throughout
the
year
and
they
should
never
be
allowed
to
be
idle
thus
it
is
abundantly
clear
that
even
in
the
time
of
cicero
there
was
a
certain
demand
for
free
labour
in
the
ordinary
italian
oliveyard
and
vineyard
and
that
the
necessary
supply
was
forthcoming
though
the
permanent
industrial
basis
was
and
the
tendency
was
to
use
more
exclusively
the
rule
that
the
slave
can
not
be
allowed
to
be
unemployed
was
a
most
important
factor
in
the
economical
development
and
drove
the
landowner
who
never
seems
to
have
had
any
doubt
about
the
comparative
cheapness
of
gradually
to
make
his
farm
more
and
more
independent
of
all
aid
from
outside
in
the
work
of
columella
written
towards
the
end
of
the
first
century
it
is
plain
that
the
work
of
the
farm
is
carried
on
more
exclusively
by
than
was
the
case
in
the
last
two
centuries
to
this
not
unpleasant
picture
of
the
conditions
of
italian
agricultural
slavery
a
few
words
must
be
added
about
the
great
pastoral
farms
of
southern
italy
if
a
man
invested
his
capital
in
a
comparatively
small
estate
of
olives
and
vineyards
such
as
that
which
cato
treats
of
and
which
seems
to
have
been
his
own
or
even
in
a
latifundium
of
the
kind
which
varro
more
vaguely
pictures
containing
also
parks
and
game
and
a
moderate
amount
of
pasture
he
would
need
slaves
mainly
of
a
certain
degree
of
skill
but
on
the
largest
areas
of
pasture
chiefly
in
the
hill
districts
of
southern
italy
where
there
was
little
cultivation
except
what
was
necessary
for
the
consumption
of
the
slaves
themselves
these
were
the
roughest
and
wildest
type
of
bondsmen
the
work
was
that
of
the
american
ranche
the
life
harsh
and
the
workmen
dangerous
it
was
in
these
districts
and
from
these
men
that
spartacus
drew
the
material
with
which
he
made
his
last
stand
against
roman
armies
in
and
it
was
in
this
direction
that
caelius
and
milo
turned
in
in
quest
of
revolutionary
and
warlike
bands
these
roughs
could
even
be
used
as
more
than
once
in
the
commentaries
on
the
civil
war
caesar
tells
us
that
his
opponents
drafted
them
into
the
vessels
which
were
sent
to
relieve
the
siege
of
massilia
it
was
here
too
in
the
neighbourhood
of
thurii
that
a
bloody
fight
took
place
between
the
slaves
of
two
adjoining
estates
strong
men
of
courage
as
cicero
describes
them
of
which
we
learn
from
the
fragments
of
his
lost
speech
they
were
of
course
armed
and
as
we
may
guess
from
varro
remarks
on
the
kind
of
slaves
suitable
for
shepherding
this
was
usually
the
practice
in
order
to
defend
the
flocks
from
wild
beasts
and
robbers
particularly
when
they
were
driven
up
to
summer
pasture
as
they
still
are
in
the
saltus
of
the
apennines
the
needs
of
these
shepherds
would
be
small
and
the
latifundia
of
this
kind
were
probably
almost
no
free
labour
being
required
after
their
day
work
the
slaves
were
fed
and
locked
up
for
the
night
and
kept
in
fetters
if
necessary
they
were
in
fact
simply
living
tools
to
use
the
expression
of
aristotle
and
the
economy
of
such
estates
was
as
simple
as
that
of
a
workshop
the
exclusion
of
free
labour
is
here
complete
on
the
agricultural
estates
it
was
approaching
a
completion
which
it
fortunately
never
reached
had
it
reached
that
completion
the
economic
influence
of
slavery
would
have
been
altogether
bad
as
it
was
the
introduction
of
on
a
large
scale
did
valuable
service
to
italian
agriculture
in
the
last
century
by
contributing
the
material
for
its
revival
at
a
time
when
the
necessary
free
labour
could
not
have
been
found
however
lamentable
its
results
may
have
been
in
other
ways
especially
on
the
great
pastures
the
economic
history
of
italy
when
it
comes
to
be
written
will
have
to
give
it
credit
for
an
appreciable
amount
of
benefit
the
legal
and
political
aspect
of
slavery
a
slave
was
in
the
eye
of
the
law
not
a
but
a
he
had
no
rights
as
a
human
being
could
not
marry
or
hold
property
but
was
himself
simply
a
piece
of
property
which
could
be
conveyed
res
mancipi
during
the
republican
period
the
law
left
him
absolutely
at
the
disposal
of
his
master
who
had
the
power
of
life
and
death
jus
vitae
necisque
over
him
and
could
punish
him
with
chastisement
and
bonds
and
use
him
for
any
purpose
he
pleased
without
reference
to
any
higher
authority
than
his
own
this
was
the
legal
position
of
all
slaves
but
it
naturally
often
happened
that
those
who
were
men
of
knowledge
or
skill
as
secretaries
for
example
librarians
doctors
or
even
as
were
in
intimate
and
happy
relations
with
their
owners
and
in
the
household
of
a
humane
man
no
slave
need
fear
bodily
degradation
cicero
and
his
friend
atticus
both
had
slaves
whom
they
valued
not
only
for
their
useful
service
but
as
friends
tiro
who
edited
cicero
letters
after
his
death
and
to
whom
we
therefore
owe
an
eternal
debt
of
gratitude
was
the
object
of
the
tenderest
affection
on
the
part
of
his
owner
and
the
letters
addressed
to
him
by
the
latter
when
he
was
taken
ill
at
patrae
in
are
among
the
most
touching
writings
that
have
come
down
to
us
from
antiquity
i
miss
you
he
writes
in
one
of
them
yes
but
i
also
love
you
love
prompts
the
wish
to
see
you
in
good
health
the
other
motive
would
make
me
wish
to
see
you
as
soon
as
possible
and
the
former
one
is
the
best
atticus
too
had
his
tiro
alexis
imago
tironis
as
cicero
calls
him
in
a
letter
to
his
friend
and
many
others
who
were
engaged
in
the
work
of
copying
and
transcribing
books
which
was
one
of
atticus
many
pursuits
all
such
slaves
would
sooner
or
later
be
manumitted
transmuted
from
a
to
a
and
in
the
ease
with
which
this
process
of
transmutation
could
be
effected
we
have
the
one
redeeming
point
of
the
whole
system
of
bondage
according
to
the
oldest
and
most
efficient
form
vindicta
a
legal
ceremony
had
to
be
gone
through
in
the
presence
of
a
praetor
but
the
praetor
could
easily
be
found
and
there
was
no
other
difficulty
this
was
the
form
usually
adopted
by
an
owner
wishing
to
free
a
slave
in
his
own
lifetime
but
great
numbers
were
constantly
manumitted
more
irregularly
or
by
the
will
of
the
master
after
his
death
thus
the
leading
facts
in
the
legal
position
of
the
roman
slave
were
two
he
was
absolutely
at
the
disposal
of
his
owner
the
law
never
interfering
to
protect
him
he
had
a
fair
prospect
of
manumission
if
valuable
and
and
if
manumitted
he
of
course
became
a
roman
citizen
libertus
or
libertinus
with
full
civil
rights
remaining
however
according
to
ancient
custom
in
a
certain
position
of
moral
subordination
to
his
late
master
owing
him
respect
and
aid
if
necessary
let
us
apply
these
two
leading
facts
to
the
conditions
of
roman
life
as
we
have
already
sketched
them
we
shall
find
that
they
have
political
results
of
no
small
importance
first
we
must
try
to
realise
that
the
city
of
rome
contained
at
least
human
beings
over
whom
the
state
had
no
direct
control
whatever
all
such
crimes
serious
or
petty
as
are
now
tried
and
disposed
of
in
our
criminal
courts
were
then
if
committed
by
a
slave
punishable
only
by
the
master
and
in
the
majority
of
cases
if
the
familia
were
a
large
one
they
probably
never
reached
his
ears
the
jurisdiction
to
which
the
slave
was
responsible
was
a
private
one
like
that
of
the
great
feudal
lord
of
the
middle
ages
who
had
his
own
prison
and
his
own
gallows
the
political
result
was
much
the
same
in
each
case
just
as
the
feudal
lord
with
his
private
jurisdiction
and
his
hosts
of
retainers
became
a
peril
to
good
government
and
national
unity
until
he
was
brought
to
order
by
a
strong
king
like
our
henry
ii
or
henry
so
the
owner
of
a
large
familia
of
many
hundreds
of
slaves
may
almost
be
said
to
have
been
outside
of
the
state
undoubtedly
he
became
a
serious
peril
to
the
good
order
of
the
capital
the
part
played
by
the
slaves
in
the
political
disturbances
of
cicero
time
was
no
mean
one
one
or
two
instances
will
show
this
saturninus
in
the
year
when
attacked
by
marius
under
orders
from
the
senate
had
hoisted
a
pilleus
or
cap
of
liberty
which
the
emancipated
slave
wore
as
a
signal
to
the
slaves
of
the
city
that
they
might
expect
their
liberty
if
they
supported
him
and
marius
a
few
years
later
took
the
same
step
when
himself
attacked
by
sulla
catiline
in
sallust
assures
us
believed
it
possible
to
raise
the
slaves
of
the
city
in
aid
of
his
revolutionary
plans
and
they
flocked
to
him
in
great
numbers
but
he
afterwards
abandoned
his
intention
thinking
that
to
mix
up
the
cause
of
citizens
with
that
of
slaves
would
not
be
judicious
it
is
here
too
that
the
gladiator
slaves
first
meet
us
as
a
political
arm
cicero
had
the
next
spring
to
defend
sulla
on
the
charge
among
others
of
having
bought
gladiators
during
the
conspiracy
with
seditious
views
and
the
senate
had
to
direct
that
the
bands
of
these
dangerous
men
should
be
dispersed
to
capua
and
other
municipal
towns
at
a
distance
later
on
we
frequently
hear
of
their
being
used
as
private
soldiery
and
the
government
in
the
last
years
of
the
republic
ceased
to
be
able
to
control
them
again
in
defending
sestius
cicero
asserts
that
clodius
in
his
tribunate
had
organised
a
levy
of
slaves
under
the
name
of
collegia
for
purposes
of
violence
slaughter
and
rapine
and
even
if
this
is
an
exaggeration
it
shows
that
such
proceedings
were
not
deemed
impossible
and
apart
from
the
actual
use
of
slaves
for
revolutionary
objects
or
as
private
it
is
clear
from
cicero
correspondence
that
as
an
important
part
of
a
great
retinue
they
might
indirectly
have
influence
in
elections
and
on
other
political
occasions
quintus
cicero
in
his
little
treatise
on
electioneering
urges
his
brother
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
his
tribesmen
neighbours
clients
freedmen
and
even
slaves
for
nearly
all
the
talk
which
affects
one
public
reputation
emanates
from
domestic
sources
and
marcus
himself
in
the
last
letter
he
wrote
before
he
fled
into
exile
in
declares
that
all
his
friends
are
promising
him
not
only
their
own
aid
but
that
of
their
clients
freedmen
and
slaves
promises
which
doubtless
might
have
been
kept
had
he
stayed
to
take
advantage
of
them
the
mention
of
the
freedmen
in
this
letter
may
serve
to
remind
us
of
the
political
results
of
manumission
the
second
fact
in
the
legal
aspect
of
roman
slavery
the
most
important
of
these
is
the
rapid
importation
of
foreign
blood
into
the
roman
citizen
body
which
long
before
the
time
of
cicero
largely
consisted
of
enfranchised
slaves
or
their
descendants
it
was
to
this
that
scipio
aemilianus
alluded
in
his
famous
words
to
the
contio
he
was
addressing
after
his
return
from
numantia
silence
ye
to
whom
italy
is
but
a
stepmother
val
max
had
manumission
been
held
in
check
or
in
some
way
superintended
by
the
state
there
would
have
been
more
good
than
harm
in
it
many
men
of
note
who
had
an
influence
on
roman
culture
were
libertini
such
as
livius
andronicus
and
caecilius
the
poets
terence
publilius
syrus
whose
acquaintance
we
made
in
the
last
chapter
tiro
and
alexis
and
rather
later
verrius
flaccus
one
of
the
most
learned
men
who
ever
wrote
in
latin
but
the
great
increase
in
the
number
of
slaves
and
the
absence
of
any
real
difficulty
in
effecting
their
manumission
led
to
the
enfranchisement
of
crowds
of
rascals
as
compared
with
the
few
valuable
men
the
most
striking
example
is
the
enfranchisement
of
by
sulla
who
according
to
custom
took
his
name
cornelius
and
though
destined
to
be
a
kind
of
military
guarantee
for
the
permanence
of
the
sullan
institutions
only
became
a
source
of
serious
peril
to
the
state
at
the
time
of
conspiracy
caesar
who
was
probably
more
alive
to
this
kind
of
social
danger
than
his
contemporaries
sent
out
a
great
number
of
libertini
the
majority
says
strabo
of
his
colonists
to
his
new
foundation
at
corinth
but
dionysius
of
halicarnassus
writing
in
the
time
of
augustus
when
he
stayed
some
time
in
rome
draws
a
terrible
picture
of
the
evil
effects
of
indiscriminate
manumission
unchecked
by
the
law
many
he
says
are
indignant
when
they
see
unworthy
men
manumitted
and
condemn
a
usage
which
gives
such
men
the
citizenship
of
a
sovereign
state
whose
destiny
is
to
govern
the
world
as
for
me
i
doubt
if
the
practice
should
be
stopped
altogether
lest
greater
evil
should
be
the
result
i
would
rather
that
it
should
be
checked
as
far
as
possible
so
that
the
state
may
no
longer
be
invaded
by
men
of
such
villainous
character
the
censors
or
at
least
the
consuls
should
examine
all
whom
it
is
proposed
to
manumit
inquiring
into
their
origin
and
the
reasons
and
mode
of
their
enfranchisement
as
in
their
examination
of
the
equites
those
whom
they
find
worthy
of
citizenship
should
have
their
names
inscribed
on
tables
distributed
among
the
tribes
with
leave
to
reside
in
the
city
as
to
the
crowd
of
villains
and
criminals
they
should
be
sent
far
away
under
pretext
of
founding
some
colony
these
judicious
remarks
of
a
foreigner
only
expressed
what
was
probably
a
common
feeling
among
the
best
men
of
that
time
augustus
made
some
attempt
to
limit
the
enfranchising
power
of
the
owner
but
the
leges
aelia
sentia
and
furia
caninia
do
not
lie
within
the
compass
of
this
book
no
great
success
could
attend
these
efforts
the
abnormal
circumstances
which
had
brought
to
rome
the
great
familiae
of
slaves
reacted
inevitably
upon
the
citizen
body
itself
through
the
process
of
manumission
rome
had
to
pay
heavily
in
this
as
in
so
many
other
ways
for
her
advancement
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
civilised
world
i
may
be
allowed
to
translate
the
eloquent
words
in
which
the
french
historian
of
slavery
in
whose
great
work
the
history
of
ancient
slavery
is
treated
as
only
a
can
treat
it
sums
up
this
aspect
of
the
subject
emancipation
prevalent
as
it
might
appear
to
be
towards
the
beginning
of
the
empire
was
not
a
step
towards
the
suppression
of
slavery
but
a
natural
and
inevitable
sequence
of
the
institution
itself
an
outlet
for
excess
in
an
epoch
overabundant
in
slaves
a
means
of
renewing
the
mass
corrupted
by
the
deleterious
influence
of
its
own
condition
before
it
should
be
totally
ruined
as
water
diverted
from
its
free
course
becomes
impure
in
the
basin
which
imprisons
it
and
when
released
will
still
retain
its
impurity
so
it
is
not
to
be
thought
that
instincts
perverted
by
slavery
habits
depraved
from
childhood
could
be
reformed
and
redressed
in
the
slave
by
a
tardy
liberation
thrust
into
the
midst
of
a
society
itself
vitiated
by
the
admixture
of
slavery
he
only
became
more
unrestrainedly
more
dangerously
bad
manumission
was
thus
no
remedy
for
the
deterioration
of
the
citizens
it
was
powerless
even
to
better
the
condition
of
the
slave
the
ethical
aspect
of
roman
slavery
what
were
the
moral
effects
of
the
system
on
the
slaves
themselves
on
the
freemen
who
owned
them
first
as
regards
the
slaves
themselves
there
are
two
facts
to
be
fully
realised
when
this
is
done
the
inferences
will
be
sufficiently
obvious
let
us
remember
that
by
far
the
greater
number
of
the
slaves
both
in
the
city
and
on
the
land
were
brought
from
countries
bordering
on
the
mediterranean
where
they
had
been
living
in
some
kind
of
elementary
civilisation
in
which
the
germs
of
further
development
were
present
in
the
form
of
the
natural
ties
of
race
and
kinship
and
locality
of
tribe
or
family
or
village
community
and
with
their
own
religion
customs
and
government
permanent
captivity
in
a
foreign
land
and
in
a
servile
condition
snapped
these
ties
once
and
for
all
to
take
a
single
appalling
instance
the
human
beings
who
were
sold
into
slavery
in
epirus
by
the
conqueror
of
pydna
or
as
many
of
them
as
were
transported
out
of
their
own
country
and
these
were
probably
the
vast
majority
were
thereby
deprived
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
of
all
social
and
family
life
of
their
ancestral
worship
in
fact
of
everything
that
could
act
as
a
moral
tie
as
a
restraining
influence
upon
vicious
instincts
with
the
lamentable
effect
of
this
on
the
regions
thus
depopulated
we
are
not
here
concerned
but
it
was
beyond
doubt
most
serious
and
must
be
taken
into
account
in
reckoning
up
the
various
causes
which
later
on
brought
about
the
enfeeblement
of
the
whole
roman
empire
the
point
for
us
is
that
a
large
proportion
of
the
population
of
rome
and
of
italy
was
now
composed
of
human
beings
destitute
of
all
natural
means
of
moral
and
social
development
the
ties
that
had
been
once
broken
could
never
be
replaced
there
is
no
need
to
dwell
on
the
inevitable
result
the
introduction
into
the
roman
state
of
a
poisonous
element
of
terrible
volume
and
power
the
second
fact
that
we
have
to
grasp
is
this
in
the
old
days
when
such
slaves
as
there
then
were
came
from
italy
itself
and
worked
under
the
master
own
eye
upon
the
farm
they
might
and
did
share
to
some
extent
in
the
social
life
of
the
family
and
even
in
its
religious
rites
and
so
might
under
favourable
circumstances
come
within
the
range
of
its
moral
influences
but
towards
the
close
of
the
republican
period
those
moral
influences
as
we
have
seen
were
fast
vanishing
in
the
majority
of
families
which
possessed
large
numbers
of
slaves
the
common
kind
of
slave
in
the
city
who
was
not
attached
to
his
owner
as
was
a
man
of
culture
like
tiro
had
no
moral
standard
except
implicit
obedience
the
highest
virtue
was
to
obey
orders
diligently
and
fear
of
punishment
was
the
only
sanction
of
his
conduct
the
typical
city
slave
as
he
appears
in
plautus
though
by
no
means
a
miserable
being
without
any
enjoyment
of
life
is
a
liar
and
a
thief
bent
on
overreaching
and
destitute
of
a
conscience
we
need
but
reflect
that
the
slave
must
often
have
had
to
do
vile
things
in
the
name
of
his
one
virtue
obedience
to
realise
that
the
poison
was
present
and
ready
to
become
active
in
every
roman
household
nec
turpe
est
quod
dominus
iubet
on
the
latifundia
in
the
country
the
master
was
himself
seldom
resident
and
the
slaves
were
under
the
control
of
one
or
more
of
their
own
kind
promoted
for
good
conduct
and
capacity
the
slaves
of
the
great
sheep
and
cattle
farms
were
as
we
saw
of
the
wildest
sort
and
we
may
judge
of
their
morality
by
the
story
of
the
sicilian
who
when
his
slaves
complained
that
they
were
insufficiently
clothed
told
them
that
the
remedy
was
to
rob
the
travellers
they
fell
in
with
the
where
slaves
were
habitually
chained
and
treated
like
beasts
were
sowing
the
seeds
of
permanent
moral
contamination
in
italy
but
on
the
smaller
estates
of
and
vineyard
their
condition
was
better
and
a
humane
owner
who
chose
his
overseers
carefully
might
possibly
reproduce
something
of
the
old
feeling
of
participation
in
the
life
as
well
as
the
industry
of
the
economic
unit
in
an
interesting
chapter
varro
advises
that
the
vilicus
should
be
carefully
selected
and
should
be
conciliated
by
being
allowed
a
wife
and
the
means
of
accumulating
a
property
he
even
urges
that
he
should
enforce
obedience
rather
by
words
than
blows
but
of
the
condition
of
the
ordinary
slave
on
the
farm
this
is
the
only
hint
he
gives
us
and
it
never
seems
to
have
occurred
to
him
or
to
any
other
roman
of
his
day
that
the
work
to
be
done
would
be
better
performed
by
men
not
deprived
by
their
condition
of
a
moral
sense
that
slave
labour
is
unwillingly
and
unintelligently
rendered
because
the
labourer
has
no
hope
no
sense
of
dutiful
conduct
leading
him
to
rejoice
in
the
work
of
his
hands
nor
did
any
writer
recognise
the
fact
that
slaves
were
potentially
moral
beings
until
christianity
gave
its
sanction
to
dutiful
submission
as
an
act
of
morality
that
might
be
consecrated
by
a
divine
authority
lastly
it
is
not
difficult
to
realise
the
mischievous
effects
of
such
a
slave
system
as
the
roman
upon
the
class
itself
even
those
who
themselves
had
no
slaves
would
be
affected
by
it
for
though
as
we
have
seen
free
labour
was
by
no
means
ousted
by
it
it
must
have
helped
to
create
an
idle
class
of
freemen
with
all
its
moral
worthlessness
long
ago
in
his
remarkable
book
on
slave
in
america
before
the
civil
war
professor
cairnes
drew
a
striking
comparison
between
the
mean
whites
of
the
southern
states
the
result
of
slave
labour
on
the
plantations
and
the
idle
population
of
the
roman
capital
fed
on
cheap
corn
and
ready
for
any
kind
of
rowdyism
but
in
the
case
of
the
great
the
mischief
was
much
more
serious
though
perhaps
more
difficult
to
detect
the
master
of
a
horde
of
slaves
had
half
his
moral
sense
paralysed
because
he
had
no
feeling
of
responsibility
for
so
many
of
those
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
every
day
and
hour
when
most
members
of
a
man
household
or
estate
are
absolutely
at
his
mercy
when
he
has
no
feeling
of
any
contractual
relation
with
them
his
sense
of
duty
and
obligation
is
inevitably
deadened
even
towards
others
who
are
not
thus
in
his
power
can
we
doubt
that
the
lack
of
a
sense
of
justice
and
right
dealing
more
especially
towards
provincials
but
also
towards
a
man
which
we
have
noticed
in
the
two
upper
sections
of
society
was
due
in
great
part
to
the
constant
exercise
of
arbitrary
power
at
home
to
the
habit
of
looking
upon
the
men
who
ministered
to
his
luxurious
ease
as
absolutely
without
claim
upon
his
respect
or
his
benevolence
or
that
the
recklessness
of
human
life
which
was
shown
in
the
growing
popularity
of
bloody
gladiatorial
shows
and
in
the
incredible
cruelty
of
the
victors
in
the
civil
wars
was
the
result
of
this
unconscious
cultivation
from
childhood
onwards
of
the
despotic
temper
even
the
best
men
of
the
age
such
as
cicero
caesar
lucretius
show
hardly
a
sign
of
any
sympathy
with
or
interest
in
that
vast
mass
of
suffering
humanity
both
bond
and
free
with
which
the
roman
dominion
was
populated
to
disregard
misery
except
when
they
found
it
among
the
privileged
classes
had
become
second
nature
to
them
we
can
better
realise
this
if
we
reflect
that
even
at
the
present
day
in
spite
of
the
absence
of
slavery
and
the
presence
of
philanthropical
societies
the
average
man
of
wealth
gives
hardly
more
than
a
passing
thought
to
the
discomfort
and
distress
of
the
crowded
population
of
our
great
cities
the
ordinary
callousness
of
human
nature
had
under
the
baleful
influence
of
slavery
become
absolute
blindness
nor
were
men
eyes
to
be
opened
until
christianity
began
to
leaven
the
world
with
the
doctrine
of
universal
love
chapter
viii
the
house
of
the
rich
man
in
town
and
country
we
saw
that
the
poorer
classes
in
rome
were
lodged
in
huge
and
enjoyed
nothing
that
can
be
called
home
life
the
wealthy
families
on
the
other
hand
lived
in
separate
dwellings
accommodating
only
one
family
often
even
in
the
ciceronian
period
of
great
magnificence
but
even
these
great
houses
hardly
suggest
a
life
such
as
that
which
we
associate
with
the
word
home
as
tucker
has
pointed
out
in
the
case
of
athens
the
warmer
climates
of
greece
and
italy
encouraged
all
classes
to
spend
much
more
of
their
time
out
of
doors
and
in
public
places
than
we
do
and
the
rapid
growth
of
convenient
public
buildings
porticoes
basilicas
baths
and
so
on
is
one
of
the
most
striking
features
in
the
history
of
the
city
during
the
last
two
centuries
augustus
part
of
whose
policy
it
was
to
make
the
city
population
comfortable
and
contented
carried
this
tendency
still
further
and
under
the
empire
the
town
house
played
quite
a
subordinate
part
in
roman
social
life
the
best
way
to
realise
this
life
lazy
and
sociable
of
the
augustan
age
is
to
read
the
first
book
of
a
fascinating
picture
of
a
beautiful
city
and
its
inhabitants
but
with
the
augustan
age
we
are
not
here
concerned
yet
the
roman
house
like
the
italian
house
in
general
was
in
origin
and
essence
really
a
home
the
family
was
the
basis
of
society
and
by
the
family
we
must
understand
not
only
the
head
of
the
house
with
his
wife
children
and
slaves
but
also
the
divine
beings
who
dwelt
there
as
the
state
comprised
both
human
and
divine
inhabitants
so
also
did
the
house
which
was
indeed
the
germ
and
type
of
the
state
thus
the
house
was
in
those
early
times
not
less
but
even
more
than
a
house
is
for
us
for
in
it
was
concentrated
all
that
was
dear
to
the
family
all
that
was
essential
to
its
life
both
natural
and
supernatural
and
the
two
the
natural
and
supernatural
were
not
distinct
from
each
other
but
associated
in
fact
almost
identical
the
was
the
dwelling
of
vesta
the
spirit
of
the
flame
the
penates
were
the
spirits
of
the
stores
on
which
the
family
subsisted
and
dwelt
in
the
or
larder
the
paterfamilias
had
himself
a
supernatural
side
in
the
shape
of
his
genius
and
the
lar
familiaris
was
the
protecting
spirit
of
the
farmland
who
had
found
his
way
into
the
house
in
course
of
time
perhaps
with
the
slave
labourers
who
always
had
a
share
in
his
worship
it
would
probably
be
unjust
to
the
roman
of
the
late
republic
to
assume
that
this
beautiful
idea
of
the
common
life
of
the
human
and
divine
beings
in
a
house
was
entirely
ignored
or
forgotten
by
him
no
doubt
the
reality
of
the
belief
had
vanished
it
could
not
be
said
of
the
city
family
as
ovid
said
of
the
ante
focos
olim
scamnis
considere
longis
mos
erat
mensae
credere
adesse
the
great
noble
or
banker
of
cicero
day
could
no
longer
honestly
say
that
he
believed
in
the
real
presence
of
his
family
deities
the
kernel
of
the
old
feeling
had
shrunk
away
under
the
influence
of
greek
philosophy
and
of
new
interests
in
life
new
objects
and
ambitions
but
the
shell
remained
and
in
some
families
or
in
moments
of
anxiety
and
emotion
even
the
old
feeling
of
may
have
returned
cicero
is
appealing
to
a
common
sentiment
in
a
passage
already
once
quoted
when
he
insists
on
the
real
religious
character
of
a
house
his
arae
sunt
his
foci
his
di
penates
his
sacra
religiones
caerimoniae
continentur
and
this
was
in
the
heart
of
the
city
in
the
there
was
doubtless
more
leisure
and
opportunity
for
such
feeling
in
the
second
century
old
cato
had
described
the
paterfamilias
on
his
arrival
at
his
farm
from
the
city
saluting
the
lar
familiaris
before
he
goes
about
his
round
of
inspection
and
even
horace
hardly
shows
a
trace
of
the
agnostic
when
he
pictures
the
slaves
of
the
farm
and
the
master
with
them
sitting
at
their
meal
in
front
of
the
image
of
the
lar
we
may
perhaps
guess
that
with
the
renewal
of
the
love
of
country
life
and
with
that
revival
of
the
cultivation
of
the
vine
and
olive
and
indeed
of
husbandry
in
general
which
is
recognisable
as
a
feature
of
the
last
years
of
the
republic
and
which
is
known
to
us
from
varro
work
on
farming
and
from
virgil
the
old
religion
of
the
household
gained
a
new
life
it
is
not
necessary
here
to
give
any
detailed
account
of
the
shape
and
divisions
of
a
roman
house
of
the
city
full
and
excellent
descriptions
may
be
found
in
middleton
article
domus
in
the
of
and
in
lanciani
and
excavations
of
ancient
and
to
these
should
be
added
mau
work
on
pompeii
where
the
houses
were
of
a
roman
rather
than
a
greek
type
what
we
are
concerned
with
is
the
house
as
a
home
or
a
centre
of
life
and
it
is
only
in
this
aspect
of
it
that
we
shall
discuss
it
here
the
oldest
italian
dwelling
was
a
mere
wigwam
with
a
hearth
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
a
hole
at
the
top
to
let
the
smoke
out
but
the
house
of
historical
times
was
rectangular
with
one
central
room
or
hall
in
which
was
concentrated
the
whole
indoor
life
of
the
family
the
whole
meaning
and
purpose
of
the
dwelling
here
the
human
and
divine
inhabitants
originally
lived
together
here
was
the
hearth
the
natural
altar
of
the
of
man
as
aust
beautifully
expresses
it
this
was
the
seat
of
vesta
and
behind
it
was
the
or
the
seat
of
the
penates
thus
vesta
and
the
penates
are
in
the
most
genuine
sense
the
protecting
and
nourishing
deities
of
the
household
here
too
was
the
lar
of
the
familia
with
his
little
altar
behind
the
entrance
and
here
was
the
and
the
genius
of
the
paterfamilias
as
you
looked
into
the
atrium
after
passing
the
or
space
between
street
and
doorway
and
the
or
doorway
with
its
you
saw
in
front
of
you
the
impluvium
into
which
the
rainwater
fell
from
the
the
square
opening
in
the
roof
with
sloping
sides
on
either
side
were
recesses
which
if
the
family
were
noble
contained
the
images
of
the
ancestors
opposite
you
was
another
recess
the
opening
probably
into
a
little
garden
here
in
the
warm
weather
the
family
might
take
their
meals
this
is
the
atrium
of
the
old
roman
house
and
to
understand
that
house
nothing
more
is
needed
and
indeed
architecturally
the
atrium
never
lost
its
significance
as
the
centre
of
the
house
it
is
to
the
house
as
the
choir
is
to
a
cathedral
and
it
is
easy
to
see
how
naturally
it
could
develop
into
a
much
more
complicated
but
convenient
dwelling
for
example
the
alae
could
be
extended
to
form
separate
chambers
or
the
tablinum
could
be
made
into
a
permanent
or
such
rooms
could
be
opened
out
on
either
side
of
it
a
second
story
could
be
added
and
in
the
city
where
space
was
valuable
this
was
usually
the
case
the
garden
could
be
converted
after
the
greek
fashion
and
under
a
greek
name
into
a
an
open
court
with
a
pretty
colonnade
round
it
and
if
there
were
space
enough
you
might
add
at
the
rear
of
this
again
an
or
an
open
saloons
convenient
for
many
purposes
thus
the
house
came
to
be
practically
divided
into
two
parts
the
atrium
with
its
belongings
the
roman
part
and
the
peristylium
with
its
developments
forming
the
greek
part
and
the
house
reflects
the
composite
character
of
roman
life
in
its
later
period
just
as
do
roman
literature
and
roman
art
the
roman
part
was
retained
for
reception
rooms
and
the
lar
the
penates
and
vesta
with
their
respective
seats
retired
into
the
new
apartments
for
privacy
when
the
usual
crowd
of
morning
callers
came
to
wait
upon
a
great
man
they
would
not
as
a
rule
penetrate
farther
than
the
atrium
and
there
he
might
keep
them
waiting
as
long
as
he
pleased
the
greek
part
of
the
house
the
peristylium
and
its
belongings
was
reserved
for
his
family
and
his
most
intimate
friends
in
pompeii
which
was
an
old
greek
town
with
roman
life
and
habits
superadded
we
find
atrium
and
peristylium
both
together
as
early
as
the
second
century
at
what
period
exactly
the
house
of
the
noble
in
rome
began
thus
to
develop
is
not
so
certain
but
by
the
time
of
cicero
every
good
domus
had
without
doubt
its
private
apartments
at
the
rear
varying
in
shape
and
size
according
to
the
ground
on
which
the
house
stood
the
accompanying
plan
will
give
a
sufficiently
clear
idea
of
the
development
of
the
domus
from
the
atrium
and
its
consequent
division
into
two
parts
it
is

but
in
spite
of
all
the
convenience
and
comfort
of
the
fully
developed
dwelling
of
the
rich
man
at
rome
there
was
much
to
make
him
sigh
for
a
quieter
life
than
he
could
enjoy
in
the
noisy
city
he
might
indeed
if
he
could
afford
it
remove
outside
the
walls
to
a
domus
suburbana
on
one
of
the
roads
leading
out
of
rome
or
on
the
hill
looking
down
on
the
campus
martius
like
the
house
of
sallust
the
historian
with
its
splendid
gardens
which
still
in
part
exists
in
the
dip
between
the
quirinal
and
the
pincian
hills
but
nowhere
within
three
miles
or
more
of
rome
could
a
man
lose
his
sense
of
being
in
a
town
or
escape
from
the
smoke
the
noise
the
excitement
of
the
streets
after
what
has
been
said
in
previous
chapters
the
crowd
in
the
forum
and
its
adjuncts
can
be
left
to
the
imagination
but
if
he
wishes
to
stimulate
it
let
him
look
at
the
seventh
chapter
of
cicero
speech
for
plancius
where
the
orator
makes
use
of
the
jostling
in
the
forum
as
an
illustration
so
familiar
that
none
can
fail
to
understand
it
a
relief
of
which
a
figure
is
given
in
burn
literature
and
roman
gives
a
good
idea
of
the
close
crowding
though
no
doubt
it
was
habitual
with
roman
artists
to
overcrowd
their
scenes
with
human
figures
even
as
early
as
the
first
punic
war
a
lady
could
complain
of
the
crowded
state
of
the
forum
and
with
the
grim
humour
peculiar
to
romans
could
declare
that
her
brother
who
had
just
lost
a
great
number
of
roman
lives
in
a
defeat
by
the
carthaginians
ought
to
be
in
command
of
another
fleet
in
order
to
relieve
the
city
of
more
of
its
surplus
population
what
then
must
the
forum
have
been
two
centuries
later
when
half
the
business
of
the
empire
was
daily
transacted
there
and
even
outside
the
walls
the
trouble
did
not
cease
all
night
long
the
wagons
were
rolling
into
the
city
which
were
not
allowed
in
the
at
any
rate
after
caesar
municipal
law
of
like
the
motors
of
one
might
imagine
that
their
noise
would
depreciate
the
value
of
houses
on
the
great
roads
the
callers
and
clients
would
be
here
of
a
morning
as
in
the
house
within
the
walls
the
bore
might
be
met
not
only
in
the
via
sacra
like
horace
immortal
friend
but
wherever
the
stream
of
life
hurried
with
its
busy
eddies
lucilius
drew
a
graphic
picture
of
this
feverish
life
which
is
fortunately
preserved
it
refers
of
course
to
a
time
before
cicero

fragm

that
this
exciting
social
atmosphere
with
its
jostling
and
in
the
forum
and
its
callers
and
in
the
house
had
some
sinister
influence
on
men
tempers
and
nerves
there
can
be
no
doubt
cicero
dearly
loved
the
life
of
the
city
but
he
paid
for
it
by
a
sensibility
which
is
constantly
apparent
in
his
letters
and
diminished
his
value
as
a
statesman
when
he
wrote
from
cilicia
to
his
more
youthful
friend
caelius
urging
him
to
stick
to
the
city
in
words
that
are
almost
pathetic
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
prescribing
exactly
that
course
of
treatment
which
had
done
himself
much
damage
the
clear
sight
and
strong
nerve
of
caesar
as
compared
with
so
many
of
his
contemporaries
was
doubtless
largely
due
to
the
fact
that
between
and
in
the
prime
of
life
he
spent
some
twelve
of
the
twenty
years
in
the
fresher
air
of
spain
and
gaul
some
men
were
fairly
worn
out
with
dissipation
and
the
resulting
ennui
and
could
get
no
relief
even
in
a
country
villa
lucretius
has
drawn
a
wonderful
picture
of
such
an
unfortunate
who
hurries
from
rome
into
the
country
and
finding
himself
bored
there
almost
as
soon
as
he
arrives
orders
out
his
carriage
to
return
to
the
city
to
fill
oneself
with
good
things
yet
never
to
be
satisfied
explere
bonis
rebus
satiareque
nunquam
was
even
for
the
true
epicurean
a
most
dismal
fate
but
there
was
at
this
time
and
had
been
for
many
generations
a
genuine
desire
to
escape
at
times
from
town
to
country
and
cicero
in
spite
of
his
pathetic
exhortation
to
caelius
was
himself
a
keen
lover
of
the
ease
and
leisure
which
he
could
find
only
in
his
the
first
great
roman
of
whom
we
know
that
he
had
a
rural
villa
not
only
or
chiefly
for
farming
purposes
but
as
a
refuge
from
the
city
and
its
tumult
was
scipio
africanus
the
elder
his
villa
at
liternum
on
the
campanian
coast
is
described
by
seneca
in
his
epistle
it
was
small
and
without
the
comforts
and
conveniences
of
the
later
but
its
real
significance
lies
not
so
much
in
the
increasing
wealth
that
could
make
a
residence
possible
without
a
farm
attached
to
it
but
in
the
growing
sense
of
individuality
that
made
men
wish
for
such
a
retreat
there
are
other
signs
that
scipio
was
a
man
of
strong
personality
unlike
the
typical
roman
of
his
day
he
put
a
value
upon
his
own
thoughts
and
habits
apart
from
his
duty
to
the
state
and
retired
to
liternum
to
indulge
them
the
younger
scipio
too
aemilianus
though
no
of
his
had
the
same
instinct
but
in
his
case
it
was
rather
the
desire
for
leisure
and
relaxation
the
same
love
of
a
real
holiday
that
we
all
know
so
well
in
our
modern
life
leisure
says
cicero
is
not
contentio
animi
sed
relaxatio
and
in
a
charming
passage
he
goes
on
to
describe
scipio
and
laelius
gathering
shells
on
the
and
becoming
boys
again
repuerascere
this
desire
for
ease
and
relaxation
for
the
chance
of
being
for
a
while
your
true
self
a
self
worth
something
apart
from
its
existence
as
a
citizen
is
apparent
in
the
roman
of
cicero
day
and
still
more
in
the
functionary
of
the
empire
twice
in
his
life
the
morbid
emperor
tiberius
shrank
from
the
eyes
of
men
once
at
rhodes
and
afterwards
at
capreae
a
melancholy
recluse
worn
out
by
hard
work
everyman
had
to
provide
his
own
health
resort
in
those
days
there
was
nothing
to
correspond
to
the
modern
hotel
even
at
the
great
luxurious
on
the
campanian
coast
baiae
and
bauli
the
houses
so
far
as
we
know
were
all
private
residences
i
do
not
propose
to
include
in
this
chapter
any
account
of
these
centres
of
luxury
and
vice
which
were
far
indeed
from
giving
any
rest
or
relief
to
the
weary
roman
the
society
of
baiae
was
the
centre
of
scandal
and
gossip
where
a
woman
like
clodia
the
lesbia
of
catullus
could
live
in
wickedness
before
the
eyes
of
all
men
let
us
turn
to
a
more
agreeable
subject
and
illustrate
the
and
the
country
life
of
the
last
age
of
the
republic
by
a
rapid
visit
to
own
villas
this
has
fortunately
been
made
easy
for
us
by
the
very
delightful
work
of
professor
schmidt
whose
genuine
enthusiasm
for
cicero
took
him
in
person
to
all
these
sites
and
inspired
him
to
write
of
them
most
felicitously
there
being
no
hotels
among
which
the
roman
of
day
could
pick
and
choose
a
retreat
for
a
holiday
he
would
buy
a
site
for
a
villa
first
in
one
place
then
in
another
or
purchase
one
ready
built
or
transform
an
old
of
his
own
into
a
residence
with
modern
requirements
in
choosing
his
sites
he
would
naturally
look
southwards
and
find
what
he
sought
for
either
in
the
choicer
parts
of
latium
among
the
hills
and
woods
of
the
mons
albanus
and
tusculum
or
in
the
rich
campanian
land
the
paradise
of
the
lazy
roman
in
the
latter
case
he
would
like
to
be
close
to
the
sea
on
that
delicious
coast
and
even
in
latium
there
were
spots
where
like
scipio
and
laelius
he
might
wander
on
the
all
this
country
to
the
south
was
beginning
to
be
covered
with
luxurious
and
convenient
houses
in
the
colder
and
mountainous
parts
of
central
italy
the
villa
was
still
the
of
the
older
useful
type
of
which
the
object
was
the
cultivation
of
olive
and
vine
now
coming
into
fashion
as
we
have
already
seen
for
cicero
and
his
friends
the
word
no
longer
suggested
farming
as
it
invariably
did
for
the
old
roman
and
as
we
find
it
in
cato
treatise
on
agriculture
it
meant
gardens
libraries
baths
and
collections
of
works
of
art
with
plenty
of
convenient
rooms
for
study
or
entertainment
sometimes
the
garden
might
be
extended
into
a
park
with
fishponds
and
great
abundance
of
game
hortensius
had
such
a
park
near
laurentum
fifty
jugera
enclosed
in
a
and
full
of
wild
beasts
of
all
sorts
and
kinds
varro
tells
us
that
the
great
orator
would
take
his
guests
to
a
seat
on
an
eminence
in
this
park
and
summon
his
orpheus
thither
to
sing
and
play
at
the
sound
of
the
music
a
multitude
of
stags
boars
and
other
animals
would
make
their
appearance
having
doubtless
been
trained
to
do
so
by
expectation
of
food
prepared
for
them
such
was
the
taste
of
the
great
master
of
asiatic
eloquence
we
are
reminded
of
the
fairy
tale
of
the
emperor
of
china
and
the
mechanical
nightingale
his
great
rival
in
oratory
had
simpler
tastes
in
his
country
life
as
in
his
rhetoric
cicero
had
no
villa
of
the
vulgar
kind
of
luxury
he
preferred
to
own
several
of
moderate
comfort
rather
than
one
or
two
of
such
magnificence
he
had
in
all
six
besides
one
or
two
properties
which
were
bought
for
some
special
temporary
object
and
it
is
interesting
to
see
what
relation
these
houses
had
to
his
life
and
habits
at
no
point
could
he
afford
to
be
very
far
from
rome
or
from
a
main
road
which
would
take
him
there
easily
the
accompanying
little
map
will
show
that
all
his
villas
lay
on
or
near
to
one
or
other
of
the
two
great
roads
that
led
southwards
from
the
capital
the
via
latina
would
take
him
in
an
hour
or
two
to
tusculum
where
since
the
death
of
catulus
in
he
owned
the
villa
of
that
excellent
aristocrat
the
site
of
the
villa
can
not
be
determined
with
certainty
but
schmidt
gives
good
reasons
for
believing
that
it
was
where
we
used
formerly
to
place
it
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
above
frascati
that
it
really
stood
there
and
not
in
the
hollow
by
grottaferrata
we
would
willingly
believe
for
no
one
who
has
ever
been
there
can
possibly
forget
the
glorious
view
or
the
refreshing
air
of
those
flowery
slopes
no
wonder
the
owner
was
fond
of
it
he
tells
atticus
when
he
first
came
into
possession
of
it
that
he
found
rest
there
from
all
troubles
and
toils
i
and
again
that
he
is
so
delighted
with
it
that
when
he
gets
there
he
is
delighted
with
himself
too
i
much
of
his
literary
work
was
done
here
and
he
had
the
great
advantage
of
being
close
to
the
splendid
library
of
lucullus
neighbouring
villa
which
was
always
open
to
him
at
tusculum
he
spent
many
a
happy
day
until
his
beloved
daughter
died
there
in
after
which
he
would
not
go
there
for
some
time
but
he
got
the
better
of
this
sorrow
and
loved
the
place
to
the
end
of
his
life
illustration
map
to
illustrate
the
position
of
cicero
villas
if
this
villa
was
where
we
hope
it
was
the
great
road
passed
at
no
great
distance
from
it
in
the
valley
between
tusculum
and
the
mons
albanus
and
by
following
this
for
some
fifty
miles
to
the
through
latium
cicero
would
strike
the
river
liris
not
far
from
fregellae
and
leaving
the
road
there
would
soon
arrive
at
his
native
place
arpinum
and
his
ancestral
property
for
this
old
home
he
always
had
the
warmest
affection
of
no
other
does
he
write
in
language
showing
so
clearly
that
his
heart
could
be
moved
by
natural
beauty
especially
when
combined
with
the
tender
associations
of
his
boyhood
in
the
charming
introduction
to
the
second
book
of
his
work
on
the
constitution
he
dwells
with
genuine
delight
on
this
feeling
and
these
associations
and
there
too
we
get
a
hint
of
what
schmidt
tells
us
is
the
peculiar
charm
of
the
spot
the
presence
and
the
sound
of
water
for
if
he
is
right
the
villa
was
placed
between
two
arms
of
the
limpid
little
river
fibrenus
which
here
makes
a
delta
as
it
joins
the
larger
liris
but
of
this
house
we
know
for
certain
neither
the
site
nor
the
plan
not
so
much
indeed
as
we
know
about
a
villa
of
the
brother
quintus
not
far
away
the
building
of
which
is
described
with
such
exactness
in
a
letter
written
to
the
absent
owner
that
schmidt
thinks
himself
justified
in
applying
it
by
analogy
to
the
villa
of
the
elder
brother
but
such
reasoning
is
hardly
safe
what
we
do
know
about
the
old
house
is
that
it
was
originally
a
true
villa
rustica
a
house
with
land
cultivated
by
the
owner
that
cicero
father
who
had
weak
health
and
literary
tastes
had
added
to
it
considerably
and
that
cicero
himself
had
made
it
into
a
comfortable
country
residence
with
all
necessary
conveniences
he
did
not
farm
the
ancestral
land
attached
to
it
either
himself
or
by
a
bailiff
but
let
it
in
small
holdings
praediola
and
we
could
wish
that
he
had
told
us
something
of
his
tenants
and
what
they
did
with
the
land
it
was
not
therefore
a
real
but
a
made
into
a
pleasant
residence
like
so
many
still
to
be
seen
in
england
its
atrium
had
no
doubt
retired
so
to
speak
into
the
rear
of
the
building
and
had
become
a
kitchen
and
you
entered
as
in
most
of
this
period
through
a
vestibule
directly
into
a
peristyle
some
idea
of
such
an
arrangement
may
be
gained
from
the
accompanying
of
the
villa
of
diomedes
just
outside
pompeii
which
was
a
city
house
adapted
to
rural
conditions
villa
pseudurbana
if
cicero
wished
to
leave
arpinum
for
one
of
his
villas
on
the
campanian
coast
he
would
simply
have
to
follow
the
valley
of
the
liris
until
it
reached
the
sea
between
minturnae
and
formiae
and
at
the
latter
place
a
lively
little
town
with
charming
views
over
the
sea
close
to
the
modern
gaeta
he
would
find
another
house
of
his
own
the
next
he
added
to
his
possessions
after
he
inherited
arpinum
formiae
was
a
very
convenient
spot
it
lay
on
the
via
appia
and
was
thus
in
direct
communication
both
with
rome
and
the
bay
of
naples
either
by
land
or
sea
when
cicero
is
not
resting
but
on
the
move
or
expecting
to
be
disturbed
he
is
often
to
be
found
at
formiae
as
in
the
critical
of
and
here
at
the
end
of
march
he
had
his
famous
interview
with
caesar
who
urged
him
in
vain
to
accompany
him
to
rome
here
he
spent
the
last
weary
days
of
his
life
and
here
he
was

not

the

seem

this
kind
as
to
literary
work
it
is
impossible
my
house
is
a
basilica
rather
than
a
villa
owing
to
the
crowds
of
visitors
from
formiae
arrius
is
my
next
door
neighbour
or
rather
he
almost
lives
in
my
house
and
even
declares
that
his
reason
for
not
going
to
rome
is
that
he
may
spend
whole
days
with
me
here
philosophising
and
then
if
you
please
on
the
other
flank
is
sebosus
that
friend
of
catulus
which
way
am
i
to
turn
i
declare
that
i
would
go
at
once
to
arpinum
if
this
were
not
the
most
convenient
place
to
await
your
visit
but
i
will
only
wait
till
may
you
see
what
bores
are
pestering
my
poor
ears
but
his
campanian
villas
would
be
almost
as
easy
to
reach
as
arpinum
if
he
wished
to
escape
from
formiae
and
its
bores
to
the
nearest
of
these
the
one
at
or
near
cumae
it
was
only
about
forty
miles
drive
along
the
coast
road
past
minturnae
sinuessa
and
volturnum
all
familiar
of
this
cumanum
however
we
know
very
little
that
volcanic
region
has
undergone
such
changes
that
we
can
not
recover
the
site
and
its
owner
never
seems
to
have
felt
any
particular
attachment
to
it
it
was
in
fact
too
near
baiae
and
bauli
to
suit
a
quiet
literary
man
the
great
nobles
in
their
vast
luxurious
palaces
were
too
close
at
hand
for
a
to
be
perfectly
at
his
ease
there
yet
near
the
end
of
his
life
cicero
added
to
his
possessions
another
property
in
this
neighbourhood
at
or
near
puteoli
which
was
now
fast
becoming
a
city
of
great
importance
but
this
can
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
a
banker
of
puteoli
named
cluvius
an
old
friend
of
his
had
just
died
and
divided
his
property
by
will
between
caesar
and
cicero
truly
a
tremendous
will
cicero
seems
to
have
purchased
caesar
share
and
to
have
looked
on
the
property
as
a
good
investment
he
began
to
build
a
villa
here
but
had
little
chance
of
using
it
it
may
have
been
here
that
he
entertained
caesar
and
his
retinue
at
the
end
of
the
year
as
described
by
him
in
the
famous
letter
of
december
xiii
when
two
thousand
men
had
somehow
to
be
provided
for
and
in
spite
of
literary
conversation
cicero
could
write
that
his
guest
was
not
exactly
one
whom
you
would
be
in
a
hurry
to
see
again
across
the
bay
and
just
within
view
from
the
higher
ground
between
baiae
and
cumae
lay
the
little
town
of
pompeii
under
the
sleeping
vesuvius
here
probably
just
outside
the
town
cicero
had
a
villa
of
which
he
seems
to
have
been
really
fond
and
the
society
of
a
quiet
and
gentle
friend
marius
whether
we
can
find
the
remains
of
this
villa
among
the
excavations
of
pompeii
is
very
doubtful
but
our
excellent
guide
schmidt
assures
us
that
he
has
good
reason
for
believing
that
one
particular
house
just
outside
the
city
on
the
left
side
of
the
road
in
front
of
the
porta
herculanea
which
has
for
no
very
convincing
reason
ever
since
its
excavation
in
been
called
the
villa
di
cicerone
really
is
the
house
we
wish
it
to
be
but
alas
an
honest
man
must
confess
that
the
identification
wants
certainty
and
the
chance
of
finding
any
object
or
inscription
which
may
confirm
it
is
now
very
small
if
cicero
were
summoned
suddenly
back
to
rome
for
business
forensic
or
political
he
would
hasten
first
to
formiae
and
sleep
there
and
thence
hurry
by
the
via
appia
and
the
route
so
well
known
to
us
from
horace
journey
to
brundisium
to
another
house
in
the
little
town
of
antium
this
was
his
nearest
seaside
residence
and
he
often
used
it
when
unable
to
go
far
from
rome
after
the
death
of
his
daughter
in
he
seems
to
have
sold
this
house
to
lepidus
and
unable
to
stay
at
tusculum
where
she
died
he
bought
a
small
villa
on
a
little
islet
called
astura
on
the
very
edge
of
the
pomptine
marshes
and
in
that
melancholy
and
unwholesome
neighbourhood
he
passed
whole
days
in
the
woods
giving
way
to
his
grief
yet
it
was
a
locus
amoenus
et
in
mari
ipso
qui
et
antio
et
circeiis
aspici
possit
it
suited
his
mood
and
here
he
stayed
long
writing
letter
after
letter
to
atticus
about
the
erection
of
a
shrine
to
the
lost
one
in
some
gardens
to
be
purchased
near
rome
this
sketch
of
the
of
a
man
like
cicero
may
help
us
to
form
some
idea
of
the
changeful
life
of
a
great
personage
of
the
period
he
did
not
look
for
the
formation
of
steady
permanent
habits
in
any
one
place
or
house
from
an
early
age
he
was
accustomed
to
travel
going
to
greece
or
asia
minor
for
his
higher
education
acting
perhaps
as
quaestor
and
again
as
praetor
or
consul
in
some
province
then
returning
to
rome
only
to
leave
it
for
one
or
other
of
his
villas
and
rarely
settling
down
in
one
of
these
for
any
length
of
time
it
was
not
altogether
a
wholesome
life
so
far
as
the
mind
was
concerned
real
thought
the
working
out
of
great
problems
of
philosophy
or
politics
is
impossible
under
constant
change
of
scene
and
without
the
opportunity
of
forming
regular
habits
and
the
fact
is
that
no
man
at
this
time
seriously
set
himself
to
think
out
such
problems
cicero
would
arrive
at
tusculum
or
arpinum
with
some
necessary
books
and
borrowing
others
as
best
he
could
would
sit
down
to
write
a
treatise
on
ethics
or
rhetoric
with
amazing
speed
having
an
original
greek
author
constantly
before
him
at
places
like
baiae
serious
work
was
of
course
impossible
and
would
have
been
ridiculed
there
was
no
original
thinker
in
this
age
caesar
himself
was
probably
more
suited
by
nature
to
reason
on
facts
immediately
before
him
than
to
speculate
on
abstract
principles
varro
the
rough
sensible
scholar
of
sabine
descent
was
a
diligent
collector
of
facts
and
traditions
but
no
more
able
to
grapple
hard
with
problems
of
philosophy
or
theology
than
any
other
roman
of
his
time
the
life
of
the
average
wealthy
man
was
too
comfortable
too
changeable
to
suggest
the
desirability
of
real
mental
exertion
nor
has
this
life
any
direct
relation
to
material
usefulness
and
the
productive
investment
of
capital
cicero
and
his
correspondents
never
mention
farming
never
betray
any
interest
in
the
new
movement
if
such
there
was
for
the
scientific
cultivation
of
the
vine
and
olive
for
such
things
we
must
go
to
varro
treatise
written
some
years
after
cicero
death
in
his
extreme
old
age
in
the
third
book
of
that
invaluable
work
we
shall
find
all
we
want
to
know
about
the
real
of
the
time
the
working
with
its
and
like
that
recently
excavated
at
boscoreale
near
pompeii
yet
it
would
be
unfair
to
such
men
as
cicero
and
his
friends
the
wiser
and
quieter
section
of
the
aristocracy
to
call
their
work
altogether
unproductive
true
it
left
little
permanent
impress
on
human
modes
of
thought
it
wrought
no
material
change
for
the
better
in
italy
or
the
empire
we
may
go
so
far
as
to
allow
that
it
initiated
that
habit
of
dilettantism
which
we
find
already
exaggerated
in
the
age
lately
illuminated
for
us
by
professor
dill
in
his
book
on
society
from
nero
to
marcus
and
far
more
exaggerated
in
the
last
age
of
roman
society
which
the
same
author
has
depicted
in
his
earlier
work
but
it
may
be
doubted
whether
under
any
circumstances
the
romans
could
have
produced
a
great
prophet
or
a
great
philosopher
and
the
most
valuable
work
they
did
was
of
another
kind
it
lay
in
the
humanisation
of
society
by
the
rational
development
of
law
and
by
the
communication
of
greek
thought
and
literature
to
the
western
world
this
was
what
occupied
the
best
days
of
cicero
and
sulpicius
rufus
and
many
others
and
they
succeeded
at
the
same
time
in
creating
for
its
expression
one
of
the
most
perfect
prose
languages
that
the
world
has
ever
known
or
will
know
they
did
it
too
helping
each
other
by
kindly
and
cheering
intercourse
the
of
daily
life
it
is
exactly
this
humanitas
that
the
northern
mind
of
mommsen
in
spite
of
its
vein
of
passionate
romance
could
not
understand
all
the
softer
side
of
that
pleasant
existence
among
the
villas
and
statues
and
libraries
was
to
him
simply
contemptible
let
us
hope
that
he
has
done
no
permanent
damage
to
the
credit
of
cicero
and
of
the
many
lesser
men
who
lived
the
same
honourable
and
elegant
life
chapter
ix
the
daily
life
of
the
before
giving
some
account
of
the
way
in
which
a
roman
of
consideration
spent
his
day
in
the
time
of
cicero
it
seems
necessary
to
explain
briefly
how
he
reckoned
the
divisions
of
the
day
the
old
latin
farmer
knew
nothing
of
hours
or
clocks
he
simply
went
about
his
daily
work
with
the
sun
and
the
light
as
guides
rising
at
or
before
sunrise
working
till
noon
and
after
a
meal
and
a
rest
resuming
his
work
till
sunset
this
simple
method
of
reckoning
would
suffice
in
a
sunny
climate
even
when
life
and
business
became
more
complicated
and
it
is
a
fact
that
the
division
of
the
day
into
hours
was
not
known
at
rome
until
the
introduction
of
the
in
we
may
well
find
it
hard
to
understand
how
such
business
as
the
meeting
of
the
senate
of
the
comitia
or
the
exercitus
could
have
been
fixed
to
particular
times
under
such
circumstances
perhaps
the
best
way
of
explaining
it
is
by
noting
that
the
romans
were
very
early
in
their
habits
and
that
sunrise
is
a
point
of
time
about
which
there
can
be
no
mistake
but
in
any
case
the
date
of
the
introduction
of
the
which
almost
exactly
corresponds
with
the
beginning
of
the
punic
wars
and
the
vast
increase
of
civil
business
arising
out
of
them
may
suggest
at
once
the
primitive
condition
of
the
old
roman
mind
and
habit
and
the
way
in
which
the
romans
had
to
learn
from
other
peoples
how
to
save
and
arrange
the
time
that
was
beginning
to
be
so
precious
this
first
came
from
catina
in
sicily
and
was
therefore
quite
unsuited
to
indicate
the
hours
at
rome
nevertheless
rome
contrived
to
do
with
it
until
nearly
a
century
had
elapsed
at
last
in
a
dial
calculated
on
the
latitude
of
rome
was
placed
by
the
side
of
it
by
the
censor
marcius
philippus
these
two
dials
were
fixed
on
pillars
behind
the
rostra
in
the
forum
the
most
convenient
place
for
regulating
public
business
and
there
they
remained
even
in
the
time
of
cicero
but
in
the
censorship
next
following
that
of
philippus
the
first
was
introduced
this
indicated
the
hours
both
of
day
and
night
and
enabled
every
one
to
mark
the
exact
time
even
on
cloudy
days
thus
from
the
time
of
the
punic
wars
the
city
population
reckoned
time
by
hours
twelve
divisions
of
the
day
but
as
they
continued
to
reckon
the
day
from
sunrise
to
sunset
on
the
principle
of
the
old
agricultural
practice
these
twelve
hours
varied
in
length
at
different
times
of
the
year
in
the
hours
were
only
about
minutes
in
length
while
at
they
were
about
and
they
corresponded
with
ours
only
at
the
two
equinoxes
this
of
course
made
the
construction
of
accurate
dials
and
a
matter
of
considerable
difficulty
it
is
not
necessary
here
to
explain
how
the
difficulties
were
overcome
the
reader
may
be
referred
to
the
article
horologium
in
the
of
and
especially
to
the
cuts
there
given
of
the
dial
found
at
tusculum
in
once
introduced
with
the
proper
reckoning
for
latitude
soon
came
into
general
use
and
a
considerable
number
still
survive
which
have
been
found
in
rome
in
a
fragment
of
a
comedy
by
an
unknown
author
ascribed
to
the
last
century
rome
is
described
as
full
of
and
many
have
been
discovered
in
other
roman
towns
including
several
at
pompeii
but
for
the
ordinary
roman
who
possessed
no
or
was
not
within
reach
of
one
the
day
fell
into
four
convenient
divisions
as
with
us
it
falls
into
three
morning
afternoon
and
evening
as
they
rose
much
earlier
than
we
do
the
hours
up
to
noon
were
divided
into
two
parts
or
morning
which
lasted
from
sunrise
to
the
beginning
of
the
third
hour
and
or
forenoon
then
followed
afternoon
and
from
about
the
ninth
or
tenth
hour
till
sunset
the
authority
for
these
handy
divisions
is
censorinus
die
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
that
they
originated
in
the
management
of
civil
business
and
especially
in
that
of
the
praetor
court
which
normally
began
at
the
third
hour
the
beginning
of
ad
meridiem
and
went
on
till
the
suprema
tempestas
diei
which
originally
meant
sunset
but
by
a
lex
plaetoria
was
extended
to
include
the
hour
or
two
before
dark
the
first
thing
to
note
in
studying
the
daily
life
at
rome
is
that
the
romans
like
the
greeks
were
busy
much
earlier
in
the
morning
than
we
are
in
part
this
was
the
result
of
their
comfortable
southern
climate
where
the
nights
are
never
so
long
as
with
us
and
where
the
early
mornings
are
not
so
chilly
and
damp
in
summer
or
so
cold
in
winter
but
it
was
probably
still
more
the
effect
of
the
very
imperfect
lighting
of
houses
which
made
it
difficult
to
carry
on
work
especially
reading
and
writing
after
dark
and
suggested
early
retirement
to
bed
and
early
rising
in
the
morning
the
streets
we
must
remember
were
not
lighted
except
on
great
occasions
and
it
was
not
till
late
in
roman
history
that
public
places
and
entertainments
could
be
frequented
after
dark
in
early
times
the
with
a
wick
was
unknown
and
private
houses
were
lighted
by
torches
and
rude
candles
of
wax
or
tallow
the
introduction
of
the
use
of
olive
oil
which
was
first
imported
from
greece
and
the
east
and
then
produced
in
italy
brought
with
it
the
manufacture
of
lamps
of
various
kinds
great
and
small
and
as
the
cultivation
of
the
valuable
tree
so
easily
grown
in
italy
increased
in
the
last
century
the
became
universal
in
houses
baths
etc
even
in
the
small
old
baths
of
pompeii
there
were
found
about
a
thousand
lamps
obviously
used
for
illumination
after
dark
but
in
spite
of
this
and
of
the
invention
of
candelabra
for
extending
the
use
of
candles
it
was
never
possible
for
the
roman
to
turn
night
into
day
as
we
do
in
our
modern
we
must
look
on
the
lighting
of
the
streets
as
quite
an
exceptional
event
this
happened
for
example
on
the
night
of
the
famous
fifth
of
december
when
cicero
returned
to
his
house
after
the
execution
of
the
conspirators
people
placed
lamps
and
torches
at
their
doors
and
women
showed
lights
from
the
roofs
of
the
houses
an
industrious
man
especially
in
winter
when
this
want
of
artificial
light
made
time
most
valuable
would
often
begin
his
work
before
daylight
he
might
have
a
speech
to
prepare
for
the
senate
or
a
brief
for
a
trial
or
letters
to
write
and
as
we
shall
see
as
soon
as
the
sun
had
well
risen
it
was
not
likely
that
he
would
be
altogether
his
own
master
thus
we
find
cicero
on
a
february
morning
writing
to
his
brother
before
sunrise
and
it
is
not
unlikely
that
the
soreness
of
the
eyes
of
which
he
sometimes
complains
may
have
been
the
result
of
reading
and
writing
before
the
light
was
good
in
his
country
villas
he
could
do
as
he
liked
but
at
rome
he
knew
that
he
would
have
the
turba
salutantium
upon
him
as
soon
as
the
sun
had
risen
cicero
is
the
only
man
of
his
own
time
of
whose
habits
we
know
much
but
in
the
next
generation
horace
describes
himself
as
calling
for
pen
and
paper
before
daylight
and
later
on
that
insatiable
student
the
elder
pliny
would
work
for
hours
before
daylight
and
then
go
to
the
emperor
vespasian
who
was
also
a
very
early
riser
after
sunrise
the
whole
population
was
astir
boys
were
on
their
way
to
school
and
artisans
to
their
labour
if
horace
is
not
exaggerating
when
he
says
i
that
the
barrister
might
be
disturbed
by
a
client
at
studies
may
have
been
interrupted
even
before
the
crowds
came
but
this
could
hardly
happen
often
as
a
rule
it
was
during
the
first
two
hours
that
callers
collected
in
the
old
times
it
had
been
the
custom
to
open
your
house
and
begin
your
business
at
daybreak
and
after
saluting
your
familia
and
asking
a
blessing
of
the
household
gods
to
attend
to
your
own
affairs
and
those
of
your
clients
although
we
are
not
told
so
explicitly
we
must
suppose
that
the
same
practice
held
good
in
cicero
time
under
the
empire
it
is
familiar
to
all
readers
of
seneca
or
martial
but
in
a
form
which
was
open
to
much
criticism
and
satire
the
client
of
the
empire
was
a
degraded
being
of
the
client
in
the
last
age
of
the
republic
we
only
know
that
he
existed
and
could
be
useful
to
his
in
many
ways
in
elections
and
trials
especially
but
we
do
not
hear
of
his
pressing
himself
on
the
attention
of
his
patron
every
morning
or
receiving
any
sportula
all
the
same
the
number
of
persons
whether
clients
in
this
sense
or
in
the
legal
sense
or
messengers
men
of
business
and
ordinary
callers
who
would
want
to
see
a
man
like
cicero
before
he
left
his
house
in
the
morning
would
beyond
doubt
be
considerable
otherwise
they
would
have
to
catch
him
in
the
street
or
forum
and
though
occasionally
a
man
of
note
might
purposely
walk
in
public
in
order
to
give
his
clients
their
chance
cicero
makes
it
plain
that
this
was
not
his
way
within
these
two
first
hours
of
daylight
the
busy
man
had
to
find
time
for
a
morning
meal
the
idle
man
who
slept
later
might
postpone
it
this
early
breakfast
called
answered
to
the
coffee
and
roll
which
is
usual
at
the
present
day
in
all
european
countries
except
our
own
and
which
is
fully
capable
of
supporting
even
a
man
for
several
hours
it
is
indeed
quite
possible
to
do
work
before
this
breakfast
antiochus
the
great
doctor
is
said
by
galen
to
have
visited
such
of
his
patients
as
lived
near
him
before
his
breakfast
and
on
foot
but
as
a
rule
the
meal
was
taken
before
a
busy
man
went
out
to
his
work
and
consisted
of
bread
either
dipped
in
wine
or
eaten
with
honey
olives
or
cheese
the
breakfast
of
antiochus
consisted
for
example
of
bread
and
attic
honey
the
meal
over
the
man
of
politics
or
business
would
leave
his
house
outside
which
his
clients
and
friends
or
other
would
be
waiting
for
him
and
proceed
to
the
forum
the
centre
as
we
have
seen
of
all
his
activity
accompanied
by
these
people
in
a
kind
of
procession
some
would
go
before
to
make
room
for
him
while
others
followed
him
if
bent
on
election
business
he
would
have
experienced
helpers
either
volunteers
or
in
his
pay
to
save
him
from
making
blunders
as
to
names
and
personalities
and
in
fact
to
serve
him
in
conducting
himself
towards
the
populace
with
the
indispensable
every
roman
of
importance
liked
to
have
and
usually
had
a
train
of
followers
or
friends
in
descending
to
the
forum
of
a
morning
from
his
house
or
in
going
about
other
public
business
what
cicero
urges
on
his
brother
in
canvassing
for
the
consulship
may
hold
good
in
principle
for
all
the
public
appearances
of
a
public
man
i
press
this
strongly
on
you
always
to
be
with
a
multitude
it
may
perhaps
be
paralleled
with
the
love
of
the
roman
for
processions
the
lustrations
of
farm
city
and
army
and
with
his
instinctive
desire
for
aid
and
counsel
in
all
important
matters
both
of
public
and
private
life
shown
in
the
consilium
of
the
paterfamilias
and
of
the
magistrate
examples
are
easy
to
find
in
the
literature
of
this
period
an
excellent
one
is
the
graphic
picture
of
gaius
gracchus
and
his
train
of
followers
which
plutarch
has
preserved
from
a
contemporary
writer
the
people
looked
with
admiration
on
him
seeing
him
attended
by
crowds
of
artificers
ambassadors
magistrates
soldiers
and
learned
men
to
all
of
whom
he
was
easy
of
access
while
he
maintained
his
dignity
he
was
gracious
to
all
and
suited
his
behaviour
to
the
condition
of
every
individual
thus
he
proved
the
falsehood
of
those
who
called
him
tyrannical
or
arrogant
arrived
at
the
forum
if
not
engaged
in
a
trial
or
summoned
to
a
meeting
of
the
senate
or
busy
in
canvassing
he
would
mingle
with
the
crowd
and
spend
a
social
morning
in
meeting
and
talking
with
friends
or
in
hearing
the
latest
news
from
the
provinces
or
in
occupying
himself
with
his
investments
with
the
aid
of
his
bankers
and
agents
this
is
the
way
in
which
such
a
sociable
and
agreeable
man
as
cicero
was
loved
to
spend
his
mornings
when
not
deep
in
the
composition
of
some
speech
or
book
and
at
rome
it
was
indeed
hardly
possible
for
him
to
find
the
time
for
steady
literary
work
it
was
this
social
life
that
he
longed
for
when
in
cilicia
one
little
walk
and
talk
with
you
he
could
write
to
caelius
at
rome
is
worth
all
the
profits
of
a
province
but
it
was
also
this
crowded
and
talkative
forum
that
lucilius
could
describe
in
a
passage
already
quoted
as
teeming
with
men
who
with
the
aid
of
hypocrisy
and
blanditia
spent
the
day
from
morning
till
night
in
trying
to
get
the
better
of
their
fellows
after
a
morning
spent
in
the
forum
our
roman
might
return
home
in
time
for
his
lunch
which
had
taken
the
place
of
the
early
dinner
of
the
olden
time
exactly
the
same
thing
affected
the
hours
of
these
meals
as
has
affected
those
of
our
own
within
the
last
century
or
so
the
great
increase
of
public
business
of
all
kinds
has
with
us
pushed
the
time
of
the
chief
meal
later
and
later
and
so
it
was
at
rome
the
senate
had
an
immense
amount
of
business
to
transact
in
the
two
last
centuries
and
the
increase
in
oratorical
skill
as
well
as
the
growing
desire
to
talk
in
public
extended
its
sittings
sometimes
till
nightfall
so
too
with
the
which
had
become
the
scenes
of
oratorical
display
and
often
of
that
indulgence
in
personal
abuse
which
has
great
attractions
for
idle
people
fond
of
excitement
thus
the
dinner
hour
had
come
to
be
postponed
from
about
noon
to
the
ninth
or
even
the
tenth
hour
and
some
kind
of
a
lunch
was
necessary
we
do
not
hear
much
of
this
meal
which
was
in
fact
for
most
men
little
more
than
the
snack
which
london
men
of
business
will
take
standing
at
a
bar
nor
do
we
know
whether
senators
and
barristers
took
it
as
they
sat
in
the
curia
or
in
court
or
whether
there
was
an
adjournment
for
purposes
of
refreshment
such
an
adjournment
seems
to
have
taken
place
occasionally
at
least
during
the
games
under
the
empire
for
suetonius
tells
us
that
claudius
would
dismiss
the
people
to
take
their
prandium
and
yet
remain
himself
in
his
seat
a
joke
of
cicero
about
caninius
rebilus
who
was
appointed
consul
by
caesar
on
the
last
day
of
the
year
at
one
shows
that
the
usual
hour
for
the
prandium
was
about
noon
or
earlier
under
the
consulship
of
caninius
he
wrote
to
curius
no
one
ever
took
luncheon
after
the
prandium
if
a
man
were
at
home
and
at
leisure
followed
the
siesta
this
is
the
universal
habit
in
all
southern
climates
especially
in
summer
and
indeed
if
the
mind
and
body
are
active
from
an
early
hour
a
little
repose
is
useful
if
not
necessary
after
busy
men
however
like
cicero
could
not
always
afford
it
in
the
city
and
we
find
him
noting
near
the
end
of
his
life
when
caesar
absolutism
had
diminished
the
amount
of
his
work
both
in
senate
and
that
he
had
taken
to
the
siesta
which
he
formerly
dispensed
with
even
the
sturdy
varro
in
his
old
age
declared
that
in
summer
he
could
not
possibly
do
without
his
nap
in
the
middle
of
the
day
on
the
other
hand
in
the
famous
letter
in
which
cicero
describes
his
entertainment
of
caesar
in
nothing
is
said
of
a
siesta
the
dictator
worked
till
after
then
walked
on
the
shore
and
returned
not
for
a
nap
but
for
a
bath
caesar
as
he
was
cicero
guest
must
have
taken
his
bath
in
the
villa
probably
that
at
cumae
see
above
most
private
houses
had
by
this
time
a
or
set
of
providing
every
accommodation
according
to
the
season
and
the
taste
of
the
bather
this
was
indeed
a
modern
improvement
in
the
old
days
the
romans
only
washed
their
arms
and
legs
daily
and
took
a
bath
every
every
ninth
day
this
is
told
us
in
an
amusing
letter
of
seneca
who
also
gives
a
description
of
the
bath
in
the
villa
of
the
elder
scipio
at
liternum
which
consisted
of
a
single
room
without
a
window
and
was
supplied
with
water
which
was
often
thick
after
rain
nesciit
vivere
says
seneca
in
ironical
allusion
to
the
luxury
of
his
own
day
in
cicero
time
every
villa
doubtless
had
its
set
of
baths
with
at
least
three
rooms
the
and
sometimes
also
an
open
as
in
the
house
of
the
silver
wedding
at
pompeii
in
cicero
letter
to
his
brother
about
the
villa
at
arcanum
he
mentions
the
apodyterium
and
the
caldarium
or
chamber
and
doubtless
there
were
others
even
in
the
villa
rustica
of
boscoreale
near
pompeii
which
was
a
working
we
find
the
complete
provided
that
is
with
the
three
essentials
of
and
room
caesar
probably
as
it
was
winter
used
the
last
of
these
took
in
fact
a
turkish
bath
as
we
should
call
it
and
then
went
into
a
tepidarium
where
as
cicero
tells
us
he
received
some
messenger
here
he
was
anointed
unctus
rubbed
dry
from
perspiration
with
a
strigil
on
which
oil
was
dropped
to
soften
its
action
when
this
operation
was
over
about
the
ninth
hour
which
in
would
begin
about
one
he
was
ready
for
the
dinner
which
followed
immediately
this
we
may
take
as
the
ordinary
winter
in
the
country
in
summer
it
would
be
an
hour
or
so
later
in
an
amusing
story
given
as
a
rhetorical
illustration
in
the
work
known
as
ad
iv
the
guests
doomed
never
to
get
their
dinner
that
day
except
in
an
inn
are
invited
for
the
tenth
hour
but
in
the
city
it
must
have
often
happened
that
the
hour
was
later
owing
to
the
press
of
business
for
example
on
one
occasion
when
the
senate
had
been
sitting
cicero
dines
with
pompeius
after
its
dismissal
i
another
day
we
find
him
going
to
bed
after
his
dinner
and
clearly
not
for
a
siesta
which
as
we
saw
he
never
had
time
to
take
in
his
busy
days
this
however
was
not
actually
in
rome
but
in
his
villa
at
formiae
where
he
was
at
that
time
liable
to
much
interruption
from
callers
ii
probably
like
most
romans
of
his
day
he
had
spent
a
long
time
over
his
dinner
talking
if
he
had
guests
or
reading
and
thinking
if
he
were
alone
or
with
his
family
only
the
dinner
was
in
fact
the
principal
private
event
of
the
day
it
came
when
all
business
was
over
and
you
could
enjoy
the
privacy
of
family
life
or
see
your
friends
and
unbend
with
them
at
no
other
meal
do
we
hear
of
entertainment
unless
the
guests
were
on
a
journey
as
was
the
case
at
the
lunch
at
arcanum
when
temper
got
the
better
of
her
see
above
even
seem
to
have
come
into
fashion
only
since
the
punic
wars
with
later
hours
and
a
larger
staff
of
slaves
to
cook
and
wait
at
table
in
the
old
days
of
household
simplicity
the
meals
were
taken
in
the
atrium
the
husband
reclining
on
a
the
wife
sitting
by
his
side
and
the
children
sitting
on
stools
in
front
of
them
the
slaves
too
in
the
olden
time
took
their
meal
sitting
on
benches
in
the
atrium
so
that
the
whole
familia
was
present
this
means
that
the
dinner
was
in
those
days
only
a
necessary
break
in
the
intervals
of
work
and
the
sitting
posture
was
always
retained
for
slaves
those
who
would
go
about
their
work
as
soon
as
the
meal
was
over
columella
writing
under
the
early
empire
urges
that
the
vilicus
or
overseer
should
sit
at
his
dinner
except
on
festivals
and
cato
the
younger
would
not
recline
after
the
battle
of
pharsalia
for
the
rest
of
his
life
apparently
as
a
sign
that
life
was
no
longer
enjoyable
but
after
the
second
punic
war
which
changed
the
habits
of
the
roman
in
so
many
ways
the
atrium
ceased
to
be
the
common
and
special
chambers
were
built
either
off
the
atrium
or
in
the
interior
part
of
the
house
about
the
peristylium
or
even
upstairs
for
the
accommodation
of
guests
who
might
be
received
in
different
rooms
according
to
the
season
and
the
weather
these
were
so
arranged
as
to
afford
the
greatest
personal
comfort
and
the
best
opportunities
for
conversation
they
indicate
clearly
that
dinner
is
no
longer
an
interval
in
the
day
work
but
a
time
of
repose
and
ease
at
the
end
of
it
the
plan
here
given
of
a
triclinium
as
described
by
plutarch
in
his
lectus
medius
chief
guest
lectus
summus
h
lectus
mensa
imus
plan
of
a
triclinium
will
show
this
sufficiently
without
elaborate
description
but
it
is
necessary
to
notice
that
the
host
always
or
almost
always
occupied
the
couch
marked
h
on
the
plan
while
the
one
immediately
above
him
no
of
the
was
reserved
for
the
most
important
guest
and
called
plutarch
account
and
a
little
consideration
will
show
that
the
host
was
thus
well
placed
for
the
superintendence
of
the
meal
as
well
as
for
conversation
with
his
distinguished
guest
and
that
the
latter
occupied
what
plutarch
calls
a
free
corner
so
that
any
messengers
or
other
persons
needing
to
see
him
could
get
access
to
him
without
disturbing
the
party
the
number
that
could
be
accommodated
nine
was
not
only
a
sacred
and
lucky
one
but
exactly
suited
for
convenience
of
conversation
and
attendance
larger
parties
were
not
unheard
of
even
under
the
republic
and
vitruvius
tells
us
that
some
were
fitted
with
three
or
more
triclinia
but
to
put
more
than
three
guests
on
a
single
couch
and
so
increase
the
number
was
not
thought
courteous
or
among
the
points
of
bad
breeding
which
cicero
attributes
to
his
enemy
calpurnius
piso
the
consul
of
one
was
that
he
put
five
guests
to
recline
on
a
single
couch
while
himself
occupying
one
alone
so
horace
saepe
tribus
lectis
videas
cenare
quaternos
as
the
guests
were
made
so
comfortable
it
may
be
supposed
that
they
were
not
in
a
hurry
to
depart
the
mere
fact
that
they
were
reclining
instead
of
sitting
would
naturally
dispose
them
to
stay
the
triclinia
were
open
at
one
end
not
shut
up
as
our
are
and
the
air
would
not
get
close
and
dinnery
cicero
describes
old
cato
no
doubt
from
some
passage
in
cato
writings
as
remaining
in
conversation
at
dinner
until
late
at
night
the
guests
would
arrive
with
their
slaves
who
took
off
their
walking
shoes
if
they
had
come
on
foot
and
put
on
their
sandals
each
wore
a
festive
dress
of
greek
origin
like
the
other
features
of
the
entertainment
and
there
was
no
question
of
changing
these
again
in
a
hurry
nothing
can
better
show
the
difference
between
the
old
roman
manners
and
the
new
than
the
character
of
these
parties
they
are
the
leisurely
and
comfortable
rendezvous
of
an
opulent
and
educated
society
in
which
politics
literature
or
philosophy
could
be
discussed
with
much
that
such
discussion
did
not
go
too
deeply
into
hard
questions
was
perhaps
the
result
of
the
comfort
there
was
of
course
another
side
to
this
picture
of
the
evening
of
a
roman
gentleman
there
was
a
coarse
side
to
the
roman
character
and
in
the
age
when
wealth
the
slave
trade
and
idle
habits
encouraged
meals
were
apt
to
become
ends
in
themselves
instead
of
necessary
aids
to
a
wholesome
life
the
ordinary
three
parts
or
courses
of
a
dinner
the
gustatio
or
light
preliminary
course
the
cena
proper
with
substantial
dishes
and
the
dessert
of
pastry
and
fruit
could
be
amplified
and
extended
to
an
unlimited
extent
by
the
skill
of
the
brought
from
greece
and
the
east
see
above
the
gourmand
had
appeared
long
before
the
age
of
cicero
and
had
been
already
satirised
by
lucilius
and
varro
splendid
might
take
the
place
of
the
old
simple
ware
and
luxurious
drapery
and
rugs
covered
the
couches
instead
of
the
skins
of
animals
as
in
the
old
time
vulgarity
and
ostentation
such
as
horace
satirised
were
doubtless
too
often
to
be
met
with
those
who
lived
for
feasting
and
enjoyment
would
invite
their
company
quite
early
in
the
day
tempestativum
convivium
and
carry
on
the
revelry
till
midnight
and
lastly
the
practice
of
drinking
wine
after
dinner
simply
for
the
sake
of
drinking
under
fixed
rules
according
to
the
greek
fashion
familiar
to
us
all
in
the
of
horace
had
undoubtedly
begun
some
time
before
the
end
of
the
public
in
the
actio
prima
of
his
verrine
orations
cicero
gives
a
graphic
picture
of
a
convivium
beginning
early
where
the
proposal
was
made
and
agreed
to
that
the
drinking
should
be
more
graeco
but
it
would
be
a
great
mistake
to
suppose
that
this
kind
of
was
characteristic
of
the
average
roman
life
of
this
age
the
ordinary
student
is
liable
to
fall
into
this
error
because
he
reads
his
horace
and
his
juvenal
but
dips
a
very
little
way
into
cicero
correspondence
and
he
needs
to
be
reminded
that
the
satirists
are
not
deriding
the
average
life
of
the
citizen
any
more
than
the
artists
who
make
fun
of
the
foibles
of
our
own
day
in
the
pages
of
cicero
hardly
ever
mentions
his
meals
his
cookery
or
his
wine
even
in
his
most
chatty
letters
such
matters
did
not
interest
him
and
do
not
seem
to
have
interested
his
friends
so
far
as
we
can
judge
by
their
letters
in
one
amusing
letter
to
poetus
he
does
indeed
tell
him
what
he
had
for
dinner
at
a
friend
house
but
only
by
way
of
explaining
that
he
had
been
very
unwell
from
eating
mushrooms
and
such
dishes
which
his
host
had
had
cooked
in
order
not
to
contravene
a
recent
sumptuary
law
the
letters
are
worth
far
more
as
negative
evidence
of
the
usual
character
of
dinners
than
either
the
invectives
vituperationes
against
a
piso
or
an
antony
or
the
lively
wit
of
the
satirists
let
us
return
for
an
instant
in
conclusion
to
that
famous
letter
already
quoted
in
which
cicero
describes
the
entertainment
of
caesar
at
cumae
in
december
it
contains
an
expression
which
has
given
rise
to
very
mistaken
conclusions
both
about
caesar
own
habits
and
those
of
his
day
after
telling
atticus
that
his
guest
sat
down
to
dinner
when
the
bath
was
over
he
goes
on
greek
emetikaen
agebat

iucunde
opipare

et
apparate
nec

sed

et

libenter
even
good
scholars
used
formerly
to
make
the
mistake
of
supposing
that
caesar
a
man
habitually
abstemious
or
at
least
temperate
had
made
up
his
mind
to
himself
on
this
occasion
as
he
was
intending
to
take
an
emetic
afterwards
and
even
now
it
may
be
as
well
to
point
out
that
medical
treatment
by
a
course
of
emetics
was
a
perfectly
well
known
and
valued
method
at
this
time
that
caesar
whose
health
was
always
delicate
and
at
this
time
severely
tried
was
then
under
this
treatment
and
could
therefore
eat
his
dinner
comfortably
without
troubling
himself
about
what
he
ate
and
drank
and
that
the
apt
quotation
from
lucilius
and
the
literary
conversation
which
so
cicero
adds
followed
the
dinner
prove
beyond
all
question
that
this
was
no
glutton
meal
but
one
of
that
ordinary
and
rational
type
in
which
repose
and
pleasant
intercourse
counted
for
more
than
the
mere
eating
and
drinking
no
more
work
seems
to
have
been
done
after
the
cena
was
over
and
the
guests
had
retired
we
found
cicero
on
one
occasion
going
to
bed
soon
after
the
meal
and
as
he
was
up
and
active
so
early
in
the
morning
we
may
suppose
that
he
retired
at
a
much
earlier
hour
than
we
do
but
of
this
last
act
of
the
day
he
tells
us
nothing
chapter
x
holidays
and
amusements
the
italian
peoples
of
all
races
have
always
had
a
wonderful
capacity
for
enjoying
themselves
out
of
doors
the
italian
of
usually
as
in
ancient
times
linked
to
some
religious
festival
is
a
scene
of
gaiety
bright
dresses
music
dancing
bonfires
races
and
improvisation
or
mummery
and
all
that
we
know
of
the
ancient
rural
festivals
of
italy
suggests
that
they
were
of
much
the
same
lively
and
genial
character
tibullus
gives
us
a
good
idea
of
them

it
would
be
easy
to
multiply
examples
of
such
from
the
poets
of
the
augustan
age
nearly
all
of
whom
were
born
and
bred
in
the
country
and
shared
virgil
tenderness
for
a
life
of
honest
work
and
play
among
the
italian
hills
and
valleys
but
in
this
chapter
we
are
to
deal
with
the
holidays
and
enjoyments
of
the
great
city
and
the
rural
festivals
are
only
mentioned
here
because
almost
all
the
characteristics
of
the
urban
are
to
be
found
in
germ
there
the
roman
calendar
of
festivals
has
its
origin
in
the
regularly
recurring
rites
of
the
earliest
latin
husbandman
as
the
city
grew
these
old
agricultural
festivities
lost
of
course
much
of
their
native
simplicity
and
na√Øvet√©
some
of
them
survived
merely
as
religious
or
priestly
performances
some
became
degraded
into
licentious
enjoyment
but
the
music
and
dancing
the
gay
dresses
the
racing
the
mumming
or
acting
are
all
to
be
found
in
the
city
developed
in
one
form
or
another
from
the
earliest
to
the
latest
periods
of
roman
history
the
latin
word
for
a
holiday
was
a
term
which
belongs
to
the
language
of
religious
law
strictly
speaking
it
means
a
day
which
the
citizen
has
resigned
either
wholly
or
in
part
to
the
service
of
the
gods
as
of
old
on
the
farm
no
work
was
to
be
done
on
such
days
so
in
the
city
no
public
business
could
be
transacted
cicero
drawing
up
in
antique
language
his
idea
of
the
ius
divinum
writes
thus
of
feriae
feriis
iurgia
amovento
easque
in
familiis
operibus
patratis
habento
which
he
afterwards
explains
as
meaning
that
the
citizen
must
abstain
from
litigation
and
the
slave
be
excused
from
labour
the
idea
then
of
a
holiday
was
much
the
same
as
we
find
expressed
in
the
jewish
sabbath
and
had
its
root
also
in
religious
observance
but
cicero
whether
he
is
actually
reproducing
the
words
of
an
old
law
or
inventing
it
for
himself
was
certainly
not
reflecting
the
custom
of
the
city
in
his
own
day
no
such
rigid
observance
of
a
rule
was
possible
in
the
capital
of
an
empire
such
as
the
roman
had
become
even
on
the
farm
it
had
long
ago
been
found
necessary
to
make
exceptions
thus
virgil
tells
us
quippe
etiam
festis
quaedam
exercere
diebus
fas
et
iura
sinunt
rivos
deducere
nulla
religio
vetuit
segeti
praetendere
saepem
insidias
avibus
moliri
incendere
vepres
balantumque
gregem
fluvio
mersare
salubri
so
too
in
the
city
it
was
simply
impossible
that
all
work
should
cease
on
feriae
of
which
there
were
more
than
a
hundred
in
the
year
including
the
ides
of
every
month
and
some
of
the
kalends
and
nones
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
double
change
had
come
about
since
the
city
and
its
dominion
began
to
increase
rapidly
about
the
time
of
the
punic
wars
first
many
of
the
old
festivals
sacred
to
deities
whose
vogue
was
on
the
wane
or
who
had
no
longer
any
meaning
for
a
city
population
as
being
deities
of
husbandry
were
almost
entirely
neglected
even
if
the
priests
performed
the
prescribed
rites
no
one
knew
and
no
one
cared
and
it
may
be
doubted
whether
the
state
was
at
all
scrupulous
in
adhering
to
the
old
sacred
rules
as
to
the
hours
on
which
business
could
be
transacted
on
such
days
secondly
certain
festivals
which
retained
their
popularity
had
been
extended
from
one
day
to
three
or
more
in
one
or
two
cases
as
we
shall
see
even
to
thirteen
and
fifteen
days
in
order
to
give
time
for
an
elaborate
system
of
public
amusement
consisting
of
and
and
known
by
the
name
of
or
as
at
the
winter
saturnalia
to
enable
all
classes
to
enjoy
themselves
during
the
short
days
for
seven
mornings
instead
of
one
obviously
this
was
a
much
more
convenient
and
popular
arrangement
than
to
have
your
holidays
scattered
about
over
the
whole
year
as
single
days
and
it
suited
the
rich
and
ambitious
who
sought
to
obtain
popular
favour
by
shows
and
games
on
a
grand
scale
needing
a
succession
of
several
days
for
complete
exhibition
so
the
old
religious
word
feriae
becomes
gradually
supplanted
in
the
sense
of
a
public
holiday
of
amusement
by
the
word
and
came
at
last
to
mean
as
it
still
does
in
germany
the
holidays
of
schoolboys
these
ludi
will
form
the
chief
subject
of
this
chapter
but
we
must
first
mention
one
or
two
of
the
old
feriae
which
seem
always
to
have
remained
occasions
of
at
any
rate
for
the
lower
classes
of
the
population
one
of
these
occurred
on
the
ides
of
march
and
must
have
been
going
on
at
the
moment
when
caesar
was
assassinated
in
it
was
the
festival
of
anna
perenna
a
mysterious
old
deity
of
the
ring
of
the
year
the
lower
class
of
the
population
ovid
tells
us
streamed
out
to
the
festum
geniale
of
anna
and
spent
the
whole
day
in
the
campus
martius
lying
about
in
pairs
of
men
and
women
indulging
in
drinking
and
all
kinds
of
revelry
some
lay
in
the
open
some
constructed
tents
or
rude
huts
of
boughs
stretching
their
togas
over
them
for
shelter
as
they
drank
they
prayed
for
as
many
years
of
life
as
they
could
swallow
cups
of
wine
the
usual
characteristics
of
the
italian
were
to
be
found
there
they
sang
anything
they
had
picked
up
in
the
theatre
with
much
gesticulation
et
iactant
faciles
ad
sua
verba
manus
and
they
danced
the
women
letting
down
their
long
hair
the
result
of
these
performances
was
naturally
that
they
returned
home
in
a
state
of
intoxication
which
roused
the
mirth
of
the
bystanders
ovid
adds
that
he
had
himself
met
them
so
returning
and
had
seen
an
old
woman
pulling
along
an
old
man
both
of
them
intoxicated
there
may
have
been
other
popular
jollifications
of
this
kind
for
example
at
the
neptunalia
on
july
where
we
find
the
same
curious
custom
of
making
temporary
huts
or
shelters
but
this
is
the
only
one
of
which
we
have
any
account
by
an
of
the
famous
lupercalia
in
february
and
some
other
festivals
which
neither
died
out
altogether
nor
were
converted
into
ludi
we
only
know
the
ritual
and
can
not
tell
whether
they
were
still
used
as
popular
holidays
one
famous
festival
of
the
old
religious
calendar
did
however
always
remain
a
favourite
holiday
viz
the
saturnalia
on
december
which
was
by
common
usage
extended
to
seven
days
in
all
it
was
probably
the
survival
of
a
festivity
in
the
life
of
the
farm
at
a
time
when
all
the
farm
work
of
the
autumn
was
over
and
when
both
bond
and
free
might
indulge
themselves
in
unlimited
enjoyment
such
ancient
customs
die
hard
or
as
was
the
case
with
the
saturnalia
never
die
at
all
for
the
same
features
are
still
to
be
found
in
the
christmas
rejoicings
of
the
italian
peasant
every
one
knows
something
of
the
character
of
this
holiday
and
especially
of
the
entertainment
of
slaves
by
their
masters
which
has
many
parallels
in
greek
custom
and
has
been
recently
supposed
to
have
been
borrowed
from
the
greeks
various
games
were
played
and
among
them
that
of
king
at
which
we
have
seen
the
young
cato
playing
with
his
boy
companions
seneca
tells
us
that
in
his
day
all
rome
seemed
to
go
mad
on
this
holiday
but
we
must
now
turn
to
the
real
organised
by
the
state
on
a
large
and
ever
increasing
scale
the
oldest
and
most
imposing
of
these
were
the
ludi
romani
or
magni
lasting
from
september
to
september
in
cicero
time
these
had
their
origin
in
the
return
of
a
victorious
army
at
the
end
of
the
season
of
war
when
king
or
consul
had
to
carry
out
the
vows
he
had
made
when
entering
on
his
campaign
the
usual
form
of
the
vow
was
to
entertain
the
people
on
his
return
in
honour
of
jupiter
and
thus
they
were
originally
called
ludi
before
they
were
incorporated
as
a
regularly
recurring
festival
after
they
became
regular
and
annual
any
entertainment
vowed
by
a
general
had
to
take
place
on
other
days
thus
in
the
year
pompey
triumphal
ludi
votivi
immediately
preceded
the
ludi
romani
of
that
year
giving
the
people
in
all
some
thirty
days
of
holiday
the
and
original
day
of
the
ludi
romani
was
the
ides
of
september
which
was
also
the
day
of
the
epulum
jovis
and
the
dies
natalis
dedication
day
of
the
capitoline
temple
of
jupiter
and
the
whole
ceremonial
was
closely
connected
with
that
temple
and
its
great
deity
the
triumphal
procession
passed
along
the
sacra
via
to
the
capitol
and
thence
again
to
the
circus
maximus
where
the
ludi
were
held
the
show
must
have
been
most
imposing
first
marched
the
boys
and
youths
on
foot
and
on
horseback
then
the
chariots
and
charioteers
about
to
take
part
in
the
racing
with
crowds
of
dancers
and
and
lastly
the
images
of
the
capitoline
deities
themselves
carried
on
biers
all
such
shows
and
processions
were
dear
to
the
roman
people
and
this
seems
to
have
become
a
permanent
feature
of
the
ludi
romani
whether
or
no
an
actual
triumph
was
to
be
celebrated
and
also
of
some
other
ludi
the
apollinares
and
the
megalenses
thus
the
idea
was
kept
up
that
the
greatness
and
prosperity
of
rome
were
especially
due
to
jupiter
optimus
maximus
who
since
the
days
of
the
tarquinii
had
looked
down
on
his
people
from
his
temple
on
the
capitol
the
ludi
plebeii
in
november
seem
to
have
been
a
kind
of
plebeian
duplicate
of
the
ludi
romani
as
fully
developed
at
the
end
of
the
republic
they
lasted
from
the
to
the
their
and
original
day
was
the
ides
on
which
as
on
september
there
was
an
epulum
jovis
in
the
capitol
they
are
connected
with
the
name
of
that
flaminius
who
built
the
circus
flaminius
in
the
campus
martius
in
the
champion
of
popular
rights
killed
soon
afterwards
at
trasimene
and
it
is
probable
that
his
object
in
erecting
this
new
place
of
entertainment
was
to
provide
a
convenient
building
free
of
aristocratic
associations
but
unfortunately
we
know
very
little
of
the
history
of
these
ludi
if
we
may
suppose
that
the
ludi
plebeii
were
instituted
just
before
the
second
punic
war
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
three
other
great
ludi
were
organised
in
the
course
of
that
war
no
doubt
with
the
object
of
keeping
up
the
drooping
spirits
of
the
urban
population
the
ludi
apollinares
were
vowed
by
a
praetor
urbanus
in
when
the
fate
of
rome
was
hanging
in
the
balance
and
celebrated
in
the
circus
maximus
in
they
were
fixed
to
a
particular
day
july
and
eventually
extended
to
eight
viz
july
in
were
instituted
the
ludi
megalenses
to
celebrate
the
arrival
in
rome
of
the
magna
mater
from
pessinus
in
phrygia
on
april
but
the
ludi
were
eventually
extended
to
april
lastly
in
the
ludi
ceriales
which
probably
existed
in
some
form
already
were
made
permanent
and
fixed
for
april
they
eventually
lasted
from
the
to
the
after
the
war
was
over
we
only
find
one
more
set
of
ludi
permanently
established
viz
the
florales
which
date
from
the
original
day
was
april
which
had
long
been
one
of
coarse
enjoyment
for
the
plebs
like
the
other
ludi
these
too
were
extended
and
eventually
reached
to
may
april
we
may
note
was
a
month
chiefly
consisting
of
holidays
the
ludi
megalenses
ceriales
and
florales
occupied
no
less
than
seventeen
of
its
days
when
sulla
wished
to
commemorate
his
victory
at
the
colline
gate
he
instituted
ludi
victoriae
on
november
i
the
date
of
the
battle
and
these
seem
to
have
been
kept
up
after
most
of
sulla
work
had
been
destroyed
they
are
mentioned
by
cicero
in
the
passage
quoted
above
from
the
verrines
as
ludi
victoriae
but
we
hear
comparatively
little
of
them
before
we
go
on
to
describe
the
nature
of
these
numerous
entertainments
it
may
be
as
well
to
realise
that
the
spectators
had
nothing
to
pay
for
them
they
were
provided
by
the
state
free
of
cost
as
being
part
of
certain
religious
festivals
which
it
was
the
duty
of
the
government
to
keep
up
certain
sums
were
set
aside
for
this
purpose
differing
in
amount
from
time
to
time
thus
in
for
the
ludi
romani
on
which
up
to
that
time
sesterces
had
been
spent
the
sum
of
sest
was
voted
because
the
number
three
had
a
sacred
signification
and
the
moment
was
one
of
extreme
peril
for
the
state
on
one
occasion
only
before
the
end
of
the
republic
do
we
hear
of
any
public
collection
for
the
ludi
in
pliny
tells
us
that
every
one
was
so
well
off
owing
no
doubt
to
the
enormous
amount
of
booty
brought
from
the
war
in
the
east
that
all
subscribed
some
small
sum
for
the
games
of
scipio
asiaticus
there
was
no
doubt
a
growing
demand
for
magnificence
in
the
shows
and
thus
it
came
about
that
the
amount
provided
by
the
state
had
to
be
supplemented
but
the
usual
way
of
supplementing
it
was
for
the
magistrate
in
charge
of
the
ludi
to
pay
what
he
could
out
of
his
own
purse
or
to
get
his
friends
to
help
him
and
as
all
the
ludi
except
the
apollinares
were
in
charge
of
the
aediles
it
became
the
practice
for
these
if
they
aspired
to
reach
the
praetorship
and
consulship
to
vie
with
each
other
in
the
recklessness
of
their
expenditure
as
early
as
the
senate
had
tried
to
limit
this
personal
expenditure
for
ti
sempronius
gracchus
as
aedile
had
that
year
spent
enormous
sums
on
his
ludi
and
had
squeezed
money
it
does
not
appear
how
out
of
the
subject
populations
of
italy
as
well
as
the
provinces
to
entertain
the
roman
people
but
naturally
no
decrees
of
the
senate
on
such
matters
were
likely
to
have
permanent
effect
the
great
families
whose
younger
members
aimed
at
popularity
in
this
way
were
far
too
powerful
to
be
easily
checked
in
the
last
age
of
the
republic
it
had
become
a
necessary
part
of
the
aedile
duty
to
supplement
the
state
contribution
and
as
a
rule
he
had
to
borrow
heavily
and
thus
to
involve
himself
financially
quite
early
in
his
political
career
in
his
writing
of
the
virtue
of
cicero
gives
a
list
of
men
who
had
been
munificent
as
aediles
including
the
elder
and
younger
crassus
mucius
scaevola
a
man
he
says
of
great
the
two
lueulli
hortensius
and
silanus
and
adds
that
in
his
own
consulship
lentulus
outdid
all
his
predecessors
and
was
imitated
by
scaurus
in
cicero
himself
had
to
undertake
the
ludi
romani
megalenses
and
florales
in
his
aedileship
how
he
managed
it
financially
he
does
not
tell
us
caesar
undoubtedly
borrowed
largely
for
his
expenditure
as
aedile
was
enormous
and
he
had
no
private
fortune
of
any
considerable
amount
our
friend
caelius
rufus
was
elected
curule
aedile
while
he
was
in
correspondence
with
cicero
and
his
letters
give
us
a
good
idea
of
the
condition
of
the
mind
of
an
ambitious
young
man
who
is
bent
on
making
the
most
of
himself
he
is
in
a
continual
state
of
fidget
about
his
games
he
has
set
his
heart
on
getting
panthers
to
exhibit
and
hunt
and
urges
cicero
in
letter
after
letter
to
procure
them
for
him
in
cilicia
it
will
be
a
disgrace
to
you
he
writes
in
one
of
them
that
patiscus
has
sent
ten
panthers
to
curio
and
that
you
should
not
send
me
ten
times
as
many
the
provincial
governor
he
urges
can
do
what
he
pleases
let
cicero
send
for
some
men
of
cibyra
let
him
write
to
pamphylia
where
they
are
most
abundant
and
he
will
get
what
he
wants
or
rather
what
caelius
wants
even
after
a
letter
full
of
the
most
important
accounts
of
public
business
including
copies
of
senatus
consulta
ad
fam
viii
he
harks
back
at
the
end
to
the
inevitable
panthers
cicero
tells
atticus
that
he
rebuked
caelius
for
pressing
him
thus
hard
to
do
what
his
conscience
could
not
approve
and
that
it
was
not
right
in
his
opinion
for
a
provincial
governor
to
set
the
people
of
cibyra
hunting
for
panthers
for
roman
games
from
the
same
passage
it
would
seem
that
caelius
had
also
been
urging
him
to
take
other
steps
in
his
province
of
which
he
disapproved
no
doubt
with
the
same
object
of
raising
money
for
the
ludi
this
letter
to
caelius
is
not
extant
but
we
may
believe
that
cicero
had
the
courage
to
reprove
his
old
pupil
and
that
the
constant
worrying
for
panthers
was
more
than
even
his
amiability
could
stand
but
others
were
less
sensitive
and
it
is
a
well
known
fact
in
natural
history
that
the
roman
games
had
a
powerful
effect
from
this
time
forwards
in
diminishing
the
numbers
of
wild
animals
in
the
countries
bordering
on
the
mediterranean
and
in
bringing
about
the
extinction
of
species
in
our
own
day
the
same
work
is
carried
on
by
the
sportsman
somewhat
farther
afield
the
pleasure
of
slaughter
being
now
confined
to
the
few
rich
and
adventurous
who
shoot
for
their
own
delectation
and
not
to
make
a
london
holiday
thus
to
all
his
ludi
the
citizen
had
the
right
of
admission
free
of
cost
an
englishman
may
find
some
difficulty
at
first
in
realising
this
it
is
as
if
cricket
and
football
matches
and
theatres
in
london
were
open
to
the
public
gratis
and
the
cost
provided
by
the
london
county
council
yet
it
is
not
difficult
to
understand
how
the
roman
government
drifted
into
a
practice
which
was
eventually
found
to
have
such
unfortunate
results
it
has
already
been
explained
that
ludi
were
originally
attached
to
certain
religious
festivals
which
it
was
the
duty
of
the
state
and
its
priests
and
magistrates
to
maintain
the
romans
like
all
italians
loved
shows
and
enjoyment
and
as
the
population
increased
and
became
more
liable
to
excitement
during
the
stress
of
the
great
wars
with
carthage
it
became
necessary
to
keep
them
cheerful
and
in
good
humour
by
developing
the
old
ludi
and
instituting
new
ones
for
which
it
would
have
been
contrary
to
all
precedent
to
make
them
pay
the
government
as
we
may
guess
from
the
history
of
the
ludi
which
has
just
been
sketched
seems
to
have
been
careful
at
first
not
to
go
too
far
with
this
policy
and
it
was
some
time
before
any
ludi
but
the
romani
were
made
annual
and
extended
to
the
length
they
eventually
reached
but
the
sudden
increase
of
wealth
after
the
great
struggle
was
over
was
answerable
for
this
as
for
so
many
other
damaging
tendencies
we
have
seen
that
the
people
themselves
in
were
able
and
willing
to
contribute
and
now
it
was
possible
for
aediles
to
invest
their
capital
in
popular
undertakings
which
might
later
on
pay
them
well
by
carrying
them
on
to
higher
magistracies
and
provincial
governorships
where
fresh
fortunes
might
be
made
the
evil
results
are
of
course
as
obvious
here
as
in
the
parallel
case
of
the
see
above
enormous
amounts
of
capital
were
used
unproductively
and
the
people
were
gradually
accustomed
to
believe
that
the
state
was
responsible
for
their
enjoyment
as
well
as
their
food
but
we
must
be
most
careful
not
to
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
this
was
due
to
any
deliberate
policy
on
the
part
of
the
roman
government
they
drifted
into
these
dangerous
shoals
in
spite
of
the
occasional
efforts
of
intelligent
steersmen
and
it
would
indeed
have
needed
a
higher
political
intelligence
than
was
then
and
there
available
to
have
fully
divined
the
direction
of
the
drift
and
the
dangers
ahead
of
them
we
must
now
turn
in
the
last
place
to
consider
the
nature
of
the
entertainments
and
see
whether
there
was
any
improving
or
educational
influence
in
them
these
had
originally
consisted
entirely
of
shows
of
a
military
character
as
we
have
seen
in
the
case
of
the
ludi
romani
and
especially
of
in
the
old
circus
maximus
the
romans
seem
always
to
have
been
fond
of
horses
and
racing
though
they
never
developed
a
large
or
thoroughly
efficient
cavalry
force
it
is
probable
that
the
position
of
the
circus
maximus
in
the
vallis
murcia
was
due
to
near
the
underground
altar
of
consus
a
harvest
deity
and
the
oldest
religious
calendar
has
equirria
on
february
and
march
no
doubt
in
connexion
with
the
preparation
of
the
cavalry
for
the
coming
season
of
war
and
in
the
very
curious
ancient
rite
known
as
the
october
horse
there
was
a
in
the
campus
martius
when
the
season
of
arms
was
over
and
the
near
horse
of
the
winning
pair
was
sacrificed
to
mars
the
ludi
romani
consisted
chiefly
of
until
when
plays
were
first
introduced
together
with
other
military
evolutions
or
exercises
such
perhaps
as
the
ludus
troiae
of
the
roman
boys
described
by
virgil
in
the
fifth
aeneid
of
the
ludi
plebeii
we
do
not
know
the
original
character
but
it
is
likely
that
these
also
began
with
the
regular
word
for
the
ludi
cereales
certainly
included
circenses
and
plays
are
only
mentioned
as
forming
part
of
their
programme
under
the
empire
but
on
the
last
day
april
there
was
a
curious
practice
of
letting
foxes
loose
in
the
circus
maximus
with
burning
firebrands
tied
to
their
tails
a
custom
undoubtedly
ancient
which
may
have
suggested
the
hunts
of
later
times
for
one
of
which
caelius
wanted
his
panthers
of
the
other
three
ludi
apollinares
megalenses
and
florales
we
only
know
that
they
included
both
circenses
and
plays
we
must
take
it
as
probable
that
the
former
were
in
their
programme
from
the
first
there
is
no
need
to
describe
here
in
detail
the
manner
of
the
we
can
picture
to
ourselves
the
circus
maximus
filled
with
a
dense
crowd
of
some
people
the
senators
in
reserved
places
and
the
consul
or
other
magistrate
presiding
the
chariots
usually
four
in
number
painted
at
this
time
either
red
or
white
with
their
drivers
in
the
same
colours
issuing
from
the
carceres
at
the
end
of
the
circus
next
to
the
forum
boarium
and
the
river
and
at
the
signal
racing
round
a
course
of
about
yards
divided
into
two
halves
by
a
spina
at
the
farther
end
of
this
the
chariots
had
to
turn
sharply
and
always
with
a
certain
amount
of
danger
which
gave
the
race
its
chief
interest
seven
complete
laps
of
this
course
constituted
a
missus
or
race
and
the
number
of
races
in
a
day
varied
from
time
to
time
according
to
the
season
of
the
year
and
the
equipment
of
the
particular
ludi
the
rivalry
between
factions
and
colours
which
became
so
famous
later
on
and
lasted
throughout
the
period
of
the
empire
was
only
just
beginning
in
cicero
time
we
hear
hardly
anything
of
such
excitement
in
the
literature
of
the
period
we
only
know
that
there
were
already
two
rival
colours
white
and
red
and
pliny
tells
us
the
strange
story
that
one
a
caecina
of
volaterrae
used
to
bring
swallows
into
the
city
smeared
with
his
colour
which
he
let
loose
to
fly
home
and
so
bear
the
news
of
a
victory
human
nature
in
big
cities
seems
to
demand
some
such
artificial
stimulus
to
excitement
and
without
it
the
racing
must
have
been
monotonous
but
of
betting
and
gambling
we
as
yet
hear
nothing
at
all
gradually
as
vast
sums
of
money
were
laid
out
by
capitalists
and
even
by
senators
upon
the
horses
and
drivers
the
increased
in
numbers
and
their
rivalry
came
to
occupy
men
minds
as
completely
as
do
now
the
chances
of
football
teams
in
our
own
manufacturing
towns
exhibitions
of
gladiators
did
not
as
yet
take
place
at
ludi
or
on
public
festivals
but
they
may
be
mentioned
here
because
they
were
already
becoming
the
favourite
amusement
of
the
common
people
cicero
in
the
speaks
of
them
as
that
kind
of
spectacle
to
which
all
sorts
of
people
crowd
in
the
greatest
numbers
and
in
which
the
multitude
takes
the
greatest
delight
the
consequence
was
of
course
that
candidates
for
election
to
magistracies
took
every
opportunity
of
giving
them
and
cicero
himself
in
his
consulship
inserted
a
clause
in
his
de
forbidding
candidates
to
give
such
exhibitions
within
two
years
of
the
election
they
were
given
exclusively
by
private
individuals
up
to
either
in
the
forum
or
in
one
or
other
circus
in
that
year
there
was
an
exhibition
by
the
consuls
but
there
is
some
evidence
that
it
was
intended
to
instruct
the
soldiers
in
the
better
use
of
their
weapons
this
was
a
year
in
which
the
state
was
in
sore
need
of
efficient
soldiers
marius
was
at
the
same
time
introducing
a
new
system
of
recruiting
and
of
arming
the
soldier
and
we
are
told
that
the
consul
rutilius
made
use
of
the
best
gladiators
that
were
to
be
found
in
the
ludus
of
a
certain
scaurus
to
teach
the
men
a
more
skilful
use
of
their
weapons
if
gladiators
could
have
been
used
only
for
a
rational
purpose
like
this
as
skilful
swordsmen
and
military
instructors
the
state
might
well
have
maintained
some
force
of
them
but
as
it
was
they
remained
in
private
hands
and
no
limit
could
be
put
on
the
numbers
so
maintained
they
became
a
permanent
menace
to
the
peace
of
society
as
has
already
been
mentioned
in
the
chapter
on
slavery
their
frequent
use
in
funeral
games
is
a
somewhat
loathsome
feature
of
the
age
these
funeral
games
were
an
old
religious
institution
occurring
on
the
ninth
day
after
the
burial
and
known
as
ludi
novemdiales
they
are
familiar
to
every
one
from
virgil
skilful
introduction
of
them
as
a
roman
equivalent
for
the
homeric
games
in
the
fifth
aeneid
on
the
anniversary
of
the
funeral
of
anchises
virgil
has
naturally
omitted
the
gladiators
but
long
before
his
time
it
had
become
common
to
use
the
opportunity
of
the
funeral
of
a
relation
to
give
munera
for
the
purpose
of
gaining
popularity
a
good
example
is
that
of
young
curio
who
in
ruined
himself
in
this
way
cicero
alludes
to
this
in
an
interesting
letter
to
curio
you
may
reach
the
highest
honours
he
says
more
easily
by
your
natural
advantages
of
character
diligence
and
fortune
than
by
gladiatorial
exhibitions
the
power
of
giving
them
stirs
no
feeling
of
admiration
in
any
one
it
is
a
question
of
means
and
not
of
character
and
there
is
no
one
who
is
not
by
this
time
sick
and
tired
of
them
to
cicero
refined
mind
they
were
naturally
repugnant
but
young
men
like
curio
though
they
loved
cicero
were
not
wont
to
follow
his
wholesome
advice
we
turn
now
to
the
dramatic
element
in
the
ludi
chiefly
with
the
object
of
determining
whether
in
the
age
of
cicero
it
was
of
any
real
importance
in
the
social
life
of
the
roman
people
the
roman
stage
had
had
a
great
history
before
the
last
century
into
which
it
is
not
necessary
here
to
enter
it
had
always
been
possible
without
difficulty
for
those
who
were
responsible
for
the
ludi
to
put
on
the
stage
a
tragedy
or
comedy
either
written
for
the
occasion
or
reproduced
with
competent
actors
and
the
necessary
music
and
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
that
both
tragedies
and
comedies
whether
adapted
from
the
greek
fabulae
palliatae
or
of
a
national
character
fab
togatae
were
enjoyed
by
the
audiences
in
the
days
of
the
punic
wars
and
afterwards
when
everything
greek
was
popular
a
roman
audience
could
appreciate
stories
of
the
greek
mythology
as
presented
in
the
tragedies
of
ennius
pacuvius
and
accius
if
without
learning
to
read
in
them
the
great
problems
of
human
life
at
least
as
spectacles
of
the
vicissitudes
of
human
fortune
and
had
occasionally
listened
to
a
tragedy
or
perhaps
father
a
dramatic
history
based
on
some
familiar
legend
of
their
own
state
and
the
conditions
of
social
life
in
rome
and
athens
were
not
so
different
but
that
in
the
hands
of
a
real
genius
like
plautus
the
new
athenian
comedy
could
come
home
to
the
roman
people
with
their
delight
in
rather
rough
fun
and
comical
situations
and
plautus
was
followed
by
caecilius
and
the
more
refined
terence
before
the
national
comedy
of
afranius
and
others
established
itself
in
the
place
of
the
greek
it
is
hardly
possible
to
avoid
the
conclusion
that
in
those
early
days
of
the
roman
theatre
the
audiences
were
really
intelligent
and
capable
of
learning
something
from
the
pieces
they
listened
to
apart
from
their
natural
love
of
a
show
of
all
acting
and
of
music
but
before
the
age
with
which
this
book
deals
the
long
succession
of
great
dramatic
writers
had
come
to
an
end
accius
the
nephew
of
pacuvius
had
died
as
a
very
old
man
when
cicero
was
a
boy
and
in
the
national
comedy
no
one
had
been
found
to
follow
afranius
the
times
were
disturbed
the
population
was
restless
and
continually
incorporating
heterogeneous
elements
much
amusement
could
be
found
in
the
life
of
the
forum
and
in
rioting
and
disorder
gladiatorial
shows
were
organised
on
a
large
scale
to
sit
still
and
watch
a
good
play
would
become
more
tiresome
as
the
plebs
grew
more
restless
and
probably
even
the
taste
of
the
better
educated
was
degenerating
as
the
natural
result
of
luxury
and
idleness
politics
and
political
personages
were
the
really
exciting
features
of
the
time
and
there
are
signs
that
audiences
took
advantage
of
the
plays
to
express
their
approval
or
dislike
of
a
statesman
in
a
letter
to
atticus
written
in
the
summer
of
the
first
year
of
the
triumvirate
cicero
describes
with
enthusiasm
how
at
the
ludi
apollinares
the
actor
diphilus
made
an
allusion
to
pompey
in
the
words
from
an
unknown
tragedy
then
being
acted
nostra
miseria
tu
es
magnus
and
was
forced
to
repeat
them
many
times
when
he
delivered
the
line
eandem
virtutem
istam
veniet
tempus
cum
graviter
gemes
the
whole
theatre
broke
out
into
frantic
applause
so
too
in
a
passage
of
the
speech
he
tells
from
hearsay
how
the
great
tragic
actor
aesopus
acting
in
the
eurysaces
of
accius
was
again
and
again
interrupted
by
applause
as
he
cleverly
adapted
the
words
to
the
expected
recall
from
exile
of
the
orator
his
personal
friend
the
famous
words
summum
amicum
summo
in
bello
summo
ingenio
praeditum
were
among
those
which
the
modest
cicero
tells
us
were
taken
up
by
the
people
with
enthusiasm
greatly
without
doubt
to
the
detriment
of
the
play
the
whole
passage
is
one
of
great
graphic
power
and
only
fails
to
rouse
us
too
to
enthusiasm
when
we
reflect
that
cicero
was
not
himself
present
from
this
and
other
passages
we
have
abundant
evidence
that
tragedies
were
still
acted
but
cicero
nowhere
in
his
correspondence
where
we
might
naturally
have
expected
to
find
it
nor
in
his
philosophical
works
gives
us
any
idea
of
their
educational
or
aesthetic
influence
either
on
himself
or
others
he
is
constantly
quoting
the
old
plays
especially
the
tragedies
and
knows
them
very
well
but
he
quotes
them
almost
invariably
as
literature
only
once
or
twice
as
we
shall
see
he
recalls
the
gesture
or
utterance
of
a
great
actor
but
as
a
rule
he
is
thinking
of
them
as
poetry
rather
than
as
plays
it
may
be
noted
in
this
connexion
that
it
was
now
becoming
the
fashion
to
write
plays
without
any
immediate
intention
of
bringing
them
on
the
stage
we
read
with
astonishment
in
a
letter
of
cicero
to
his
brother
quintus
then
in
gaul
that
the
latter
had
taken
to
and
accomplished
four
tragedies
in
sixteen
days
and
this
apparently
in
the
course
of
the
campaign
one
the
was
sent
to
his
brother
from
britain
and
lost
on
the
way
we
hear
no
more
of
these
plays
and
have
no
reason
to
suppose
that
they
were
worthy
to
survive
no
man
of
literary
eminence
in
that
day
wrote
plays
for
acting
and
in
fact
the
only
person
of
note
so
far
as
we
know
who
did
so
was
the
younger
cornelius
balbus
son
of
the
intimate
friend
and
secretary
of
caesar
this
man
wrote
one
in
latin
about
his
journey
to
his
native
town
of
gades
had
it
put
on
the
stage
there
and
shed
tears
during
its
performance
when
we
hear
of
plays
being
written
without
being
acted
and
of
tragedies
being
made
the
occasion
of
expressing
political
opinions
we
may
be
pretty
sure
that
the
drama
is
in
its
nonage
an
interesting
proof
of
the
same
tendency
is
to
be
found
in
the
first
book
of
the
of
ovid
though
it
belongs
to
the
age
of
augustus
in
this
book
ovid
describes
the
various
resorts
in
the
city
where
the
youth
may
look
out
for
his
girl
and
when
he
comes
to
the
theatre
draws
a
pretty
picture
of
the
ladies
of
taste
and
fashion
crowding
thither
but
spectatum
veniunt
veniunt
spectentur
ut
ipsae
and
then
without
a
word
about
the
play
or
the
smallest
hint
that
he
or
the
ladies
really
cared
about
such
things
he
goes
off
into
the
familiar
story
of
the
rape
of
the
sabine
women
supposed
to
have
taken
place
when
romulus
was
holding
his
ludi
it
is
curious
in
view
of
what
thus
seems
to
be
a
flagging
interest
in
the
drama
as
such
to
find
that
the
most
remarkable
event
in
the
theatrical
history
of
this
time
is
the
building
of
the
first
permanent
stone
theatre
during
the
whole
long
period
of
the
popularity
of
the
drama
the
government
had
never
consented
to
the
erection
of
a
permanent
theatre
after
the
greek
fashion
though
it
was
impossible
to
prohibit
the
production
of
plays
adapted
from
the
greek
there
seems
to
have
been
some
strange
scruple
felt
about
giving
rome
this
outward
token
of
a
greek
city
temporary
stages
were
erected
in
the
forum
or
the
circus
the
audience
at
first
standing
but
afterwards
accommodated
with
seats
in
a
of
wood
erected
for
the
occasion
the
whole
show
including
play
actors
and
to
accompany
the
voices
where
necessary
was
contracted
for
like
all
such
undertakings
on
each
occasion
of
ludi
scaenici
being
produced
at
last
in
the
year
the
censors
had
actually
set
about
the
building
of
a
theatre
apparently
of
stone
when
the
reactionary
scipio
nasica
acting
under
the
influence
of
a
temporary
movement
persuaded
the
senate
to
put
a
stop
to
this
symptom
of
degeneracy
and
to
pass
a
decree
that
no
seats
were
in
future
to
be
provided
ut
scilicet
remissioni
animorum
standi
virilitas
propria
romanae
gentis
iuncta
esset
whether
this
extraordinary
decree
of
which
the
legality
might
have
been
questioned
a
generation
later
had
any
permanent
effect
we
do
not
know
certainly
the
senators
and
after
the
time
of
gaius
gracchus
the
equites
sat
on
seats
appropriated
to
them
but
rome
continued
to
be
without
a
stone
theatre
until
pompey
in
the
year
of
his
second
consulship
built
one
on
a
grand
scale
capable
of
holding
people
even
he
we
are
told
could
not
accomplish
this
without
some
criticism
from
the
old
and
so
lasting
was
the
prejudice
against
anything
that
might
seem
to
be
turning
rome
into
a
greek
city
there
was
a
story
too
of
which
it
is
difficult
to
make
out
the
real
origin
that
he
was
compelled
by
popular
feeling
to
conceal
his
design
by
building
immediately
behind
the
theatre
a
temple
of
venus
victrix
the
steps
of
which
were
in
some
way
connected
with
his
auditorium
the
theatre
was
placed
in
the
campus
martius
and
its
shape
is
fairly
well
known
to
us
from
fragments
of
the
capitoline
plan
of
the
city
adjoining
it
pompey
also
built
a
magnificent
for
the
convenience
of
the
audience
and
a
in
which
the
senate
could
meet
and
where
eleven
years
later
the
great
dictator
was
murdered
at
the
feet
of
pompey
statue
in
spite
of
the
magnificence
of
this
building
it
was
by
no
means
destined
to
revive
the
earlier
prosperity
of
the
tragic
and
comic
drama
even
at
the
opening
of
it
the
signs
of
degeneracy
are
apparent
luckily
for
us
cicero
was
in
rome
at
the
time
and
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
in
the
country
he
congratulates
him
on
being
too
unwell
to
come
to
rome
and
see
the
spoiling
of
old
tragedies
by
the
ludi
he
says
had
not
even
that
charm
which
games
on
a
moderate
scale
generally
have
the
spectacle
was
so
elaborate
as
to
leave
no
room
for
cheerful
enjoyment
and
i
think
you
need
feel
no
regret
at
having
missed
it
what
is
the
pleasure
of
a
train
of
six
hundred
mules
in
the
clytemnestra
of
accius
or
three
thousand
bowls
craterae
in
the
trojan
horse
of
livius
or
armour
of
infantry
and
cavalry
in
some
mimic
battle
these
things
roused
the
admiration
of
the
vulgar
to
you
they
would
have
brought
no
delight
this
ostentatious
finds
its
counterpart
to
some
extent
at
the
present
day
and
may
remind
us
also
of
the
huge
orchestras
of
blaring
sound
which
are
the
delight
of
the
modern
composer
and
the
modern
musical
audience
and
the
plays
were
by
no
means
the
only
part
of
the
show
there
were
displays
of
athletes
but
these
never
seem
to
have
greatly
interested
a
roman
audience
and
cicero
says
that
pompey
confessed
that
they
were
a
failure
but
to
make
up
for
that
there
were
shows
for
five
whole
days
magnificent
the
letter
goes
on
no
one
denies
it
yet
what
pleasure
can
it
be
to
a
man
of
refinement
when
a
weak
man
is
torn
by
a
very
powerful
animal
or
a
splendid
animal
is
transfixed
by
a
the
last
day
was
that
of
the
elephants
about
which
there
was
a
good
deal
of
astonishment
on
the
part
of
the
vulgar
crowd
but
no
pleasure
whatever
nay
there
was
even
a
feeling
of
compassion
aroused
by
them
and
a
notion
that
this
animal
has
something
in
common
with
mankind
this
last
interesting
sentence
is
confirmed
by
a
passage
in
pliny
in
which
he
asserts
that
the
people
were
so
much
moved
that
they
actually
execrated
pompey
the
last
age
of
the
republic
is
a
transitional
one
in
this
as
in
other
ways
the
people
are
not
yet
thoroughly
inured
to
bloodshed
and
cruelty
to
animals
as
they
afterwards
became
when
deprived
of
political
excitements
and
left
with
nothing
violent
to
amuse
them
but
the
displays
of
the
amphitheatre
earlier
in
this
same
letter
cicero
had
told
his
friend
marius
that
on
this
occasion
certain
old
actors
had
on
the
stage
who
as
he
thought
had
left
it
for
good
the
only
one
he
mentions
is
the
great
tragic
actor
aesopus
who
was
in
such
a
state
that
no
one
could
say
a
word
against
his
retiring
from
the
profession
at
one
important
point
his
voice
failed
him
this
may
conveniently
remind
us
that
aesopus
was
the
last
of
the
great
actors
of
tragedy
and
that
his
best
days
were
in
the
early
half
of
this
century
another
sign
of
the
decay
of
the
legitimate
drama
he
was
an
intimate
friend
of
cicero
and
from
a
few
references
to
him
in
the
ciceronian
writings
we
can
form
some
idea
of
his
genius
in
one
passage
cicero
writes
of
having
seen
him
looking
so
wild
and
gesticulating
so
excitedly
that
he
seemed
almost
to
have
lost
command
of
himself
in
the
description
already
quoted
from
the
speech
of
the
scene
in
the
theatre
before
his
recall
from
exile
he
speaks
of
this
summus
artifex
as
delivering
his
allusions
to
the
exile
with
infinite
force
and
passion
yet
the
later
tradition
of
his
acting
was
rather
that
he
was
serious
and
horace
calls
him
and
quintilian
too
speaks
of
his
probably
like
garrick
he
was
capable
of
a
great
variety
of
moods
and
parts
how
carefully
he
studied
the
varieties
of
gesticulation
is
indicated
by
a
curious
story
preserved
by
valerius
maximus
that
he
and
roscius
the
great
comedian
used
to
go
and
sit
in
the
courts
in
order
to
observe
the
action
of
the
orator
hortensius
roscius
too
was
an
early
intimate
friend
of
cicero
who
like
caesar
seems
to
have
valued
the
friendship
of
all
men
of
genius
without
regard
to
their
origin
or
profession
roscius
seems
to
have
been
a
freedman
his
great
days
were
in
cicero
early
life
and
he
died
in
to
the
deep
grief
of
all
his
friends
so
wonderfully
finished
was
his
acting
that
it
became
a
common
practice
to
call
any
one
a
roscius
whose
work
was
more
than
usually
perfect
he
never
could
find
a
pupil
of
whom
he
could
entirely
approve
many
had
good
points
but
if
there
were
a
single
blot
the
master
could
not
bear
it
in
the
cicero
tells
us
several
interesting
things
about
him
how
he
laid
the
proper
emphasis
on
the
right
words
reserving
his
gesticulation
until
he
came
to
them
and
how
he
was
never
so
much
admired
when
acting
with
a
mask
on
because
the
expression
of
his
face
was
so
full
of
meaning
in
cicero
later
years
when
roscius
was
dead
and
aesopus
retired
we
hear
no
more
of
great
actors
of
this
type
with
these
two
remarkable
men
the
great
days
of
the
roman
drama
come
to
an
end
and
henceforward
the
favourite
plays
are
merely
farces
of
which
a
word
must
here
be
said
in
the
last
place
the
origin
of
these
farces
as
indeed
of
all
kinds
of
latin
comedy
and
probably
also
of
the
literary
satura
is
to
be
found
in
the
jokes
and
rude
fun
of
the
country
festivals
and
especially
perhaps
as
horace
tells
us
of
the
harvest
amusements

ii

these
amusements
were
always
accompanied
with
the
music
and
dancing
so
dear
to
the
italian
peoples
and
it
is
easy
to
divine
how
they
may
have
gradually
developed
into
plays
of
a
rude
but
tolerably
fixed
type
with
improvised
dialogue
acted
in
the
streets
or
later
in
the
intervals
between
acts
at
the
theatre
and
eventually
as
afterpieces
more
after
our
own
fashion
in
cicero
day
two
kinds
of
farces
were
in
vogue
in
his
earlier
life
the
atellan
plays
fabulae
atellanae
were
the
favourites
these
were
of
indigenous
latin
origin
and
probably
took
their
name
from
the
ruined
town
atella
which
might
provide
a
permanent
scenery
as
the
background
of
the
plays
without
offending
the
jealousy
of
any
of
the
other
latin
cities
they
were
doubtless
very
comic
but
it
was
possible
to
get
tired
of
them
for
the
number
of
stock
characters
was
limited
and
the
masks
were
always
the
same
for
each
character
the
old
man
pappus
the
glutton
bucco
dossennus
the
sharper
etc
about
the
time
of
sulla
the
seem
to
have
displaced
these
old
farces
in
popular
favour
perhaps
because
their
fun
was
more
varied
the
mere
fact
that
the
actors
did
not
wear
masks
shows
that
the
improvisation
could
be
freer
and
less
stereotyped
but
both
kinds
were
alike
coarse
and
may
be
called
the
comedy
of
low
life
in
country
towns
and
in
the
great
city
sulla
tastes
seem
to
have
been
low
in
the
matter
of
plays
if
we
may
trust
plutarch
who
asserts
that
when
he
was
young
he
spent
much
of
his
time
among
and
jesters
and
that
when
he
was
dictator
he
daily
got
together
from
the
theatre
the
lewdest
persons
with
whom
he
would
drink
and
enter
into
a
contest
of
coarse
witticisms
this
may
be
due
to
the
evidence
of
an
enemy
but
it
is
not
improbable
and
it
is
possible
that
both
sulla
and
caesar
who
also
patronised
the
mimes
may
have
wished
to
avoid
the
personal
allusions
which
as
we
have
seen
were
so
often
made
or
imagined
in
the
exhibition
of
tragedies
and
have
aimed
at
confining
the
plays
to
such
as
would
give
less
opportunity
for
unwelcome
criticism
about
the
year
as
we
have
seen
in
the
chapter
on
education
there
came
to
italy
the
syrian
publilius
who
began
to
write
mimes
in
verse
thus
for
the
first
time
giving
them
a
literary
turn
caesar
always
on
the
for
talent
summoned
him
to
rome
and
awarded
him
the
palm
for
his
plays
these
must
have
been
as
regards
wit
and
style
of
a
much
higher
order
than
any
previous
mimes
and
in
fact
not
far
removed
from
the
older
roman
comedy
fabula
togata
in
manner
cicero
alludes
to
them
twice
and
writing
to
cornificius
from
rome
in
october
he
says
that
at
caesar
ludi
he
listened
to
the
poems
of
publilius
and
laberius
with
a
mind
nihil
mihi
tamen
deesse
scito
quam
quicum
haec
familiariter
docteque
rideam
here
the
word
seems
to
suggest
that
the
performance
was
at
least
worthy
of
the
attention
of
a
cultivated
man
laberius
also
a
roman
knight
wrote
mimes
at
the
same
time
as
publilius
and
was
beaten
by
him
in
competition
of
him
it
is
told
that
he
was
induced
by
caesar
to
act
in
his
own
mime
and
revenged
himself
for
the
insult
as
it
was
then
felt
to
be
by
a
roman
of
good
birth
in
a
prologue
which
has
come
down
to
us
we
may
suppose
that
his
plays
were
of
the
same
type
as
those
of
publilius
and
interspersed
with
those
wise
sayings
which
the
roman
people
were
still
capable
of
appreciating
even
in
the
time
of
seneca
applause
was
given
to
any
words
which
the
audience
felt
at
once
to
be
true
and
to
hit
the
mark
thus
the
mime
was
lifted
from
the
level
of
the
lowest
farcical
improvisation
to
a
recognised
position
in
literature
and
quite
incidentally
became
useful
in
education
but
the
coarseness
remained
the
dancing
was
grotesque
and
the
fun
ribald
and
as
professor
purser
says
the
plots
nearly
always
involved
some
incident
of
an
amorous
nature
in
which
ordinary
morality
was
set
at
defiance
the
roman
audience
of
the
early
empire
enjoyed
these
things
and
all
sorts
of
dancing
singing
and
instrumental
music
and
above
all
the
in
which
the
actor
only
gesticulated
without
speaking
this
and
the
fact
that
the
real
drama
never
again
had
a
fair
chance
is
one
of
the
many
signs
that
the
city
population
was
losing
both
virility
and
intelligence
chapter
xi
religion
it
is
easy
to
write
the
word
religion
at
the
head
of
this
chapter
but
by
no
means
easy
to
find
anything
in
this
materialistic
period
which
answers
to
our
use
of
the
word
in
the
whole
mass
for
example
of
the
ciceronian
correspondence
there
is
hardly
anything
to
show
that
cicero
and
his
friends
and
therefore
as
we
may
presume
the
average
educated
man
of
the
day
were
affected
in
their
thinking
or
their
conduct
by
any
sense
of
dependence
on
or
responsibility
to
a
supreme
being
if
however
it
had
been
possible
to
substitute
for
the
english
word
the
latin
it
would
have
made
a
far
more
appropriate
title
to
this
chapter
for
meant
primarily
awe
nervousness
scruple
much
the
same
in
fact
as
that
feeling
which
in
these
days
we
call
superstition
and
secondarily
the
means
taken
under
the
authority
of
the
state
to
quiet
such
feelings
by
the
performance
of
rites
meant
to
propitiate
the
gods
in
both
of
these
senses
is
to
be
found
in
the
last
age
of
the
republic
but
as
we
shall
see
the
tendency
to
superstitious
nervousness
was
very
imperfectly
allayed
and
the
worship
that
should
have
allayed
it
was
in
great
measure
neglected
it
may
be
indeed
that
in
quiet
country
districts
the
joyous
rural
festivals
went
on
we
have
many
allusions
and
a
few
descriptions
of
them
in
the
literature
of
the
augustan
period
and
also
the
worship
of
the
household
deities
in
which
there
perhaps
survived
a
feeling
of
more
nearly
akin
to
what
we
call
religious
feeling
than
in
any
of
the
cults
undertaken
by
the
state
for
the
people
even
in
the
city
the
cult
of
the
dead
or
what
may
perhaps
be
better
called
the
religious
attention
paid
to
their
and
the
religious
ceremonies
attending
birth
puberty
and
marriage
were
kept
up
as
matters
of
form
and
custom
among
the
upper
and
wealthier
classes
but
the
great
mass
of
the
population
of
rome
we
may
be
almost
sure
knew
nothing
of
these
rites
the
poor
man
for
example
could
no
more
afford
a
tomb
for
himself
than
a
house
and
his
body
was
thrown
into
some
or
common
where
it
was
impossible
that
any
yearly
ceremonies
could
be
performed
to
his
memory
even
if
any
one
cared
to
do
so
and
among
the
higher
strata
of
society
outside
of
these
carelessness
and
negligence
of
the
old
state
cults
were
steadily
on
the
increase
neither
cicero
nor
any
of
his
contemporaries
but
varro
has
anything
to
tell
us
of
their
details
and
the
decay
had
gone
so
far
that
varro
himself
knew
little
or
nothing
about
many
of
the
deities
of
the
old
religious
calendar
or
of
the
ways
in
which
they
had
at
one
time
been
worshipped
vesta
with
her
simple
cult
and
her
virgin
priestesses
was
almost
the
only
deity
who
was
not
either
forgotten
or
metamorphosed
in
one
way
or
another
under
the
influence
of
greek
literature
and
mythology
vesta
was
too
well
recognised
as
a
symbol
of
the
state
vitality
to
be
subject
to
neglect
like
other
and
less
significant
cults
the
old
sacrificing
priesthoods
such
as
the
fratres
arvales
and
the
lesser
flamines
seem
not
to
have
been
filled
up
by
the
pontifices
whose
duty
it
was
to
do
so
and
the
flamen
dialis
the
priest
of
jupiter
himself
is
not
heard
of
from
to
when
he
appears
again
as
a
part
of
the
augustan
religious
restoration
the
explanation
is
probably
that
these
offices
could
not
be
held
together
with
any
secular
one
which
might
take
the
holder
away
from
rome
and
as
every
man
of
good
family
had
business
in
the
provinces
no
qualified
person
could
be
found
willing
to
put
himself
under
the
restriction
the
temples
too
seem
to
have
been
sadly
neglected
augustus
tells
us
himself
that
he
had
to
restore
no
less
than
and
from
cicero
we
actually
hear
of
thefts
of
statues
and
other
temple
property
sacrileges
which
may
be
attributed
to
the
general
demoralisation
caused
by
the
social
and
civil
wars
at
the
same
time
there
seems
to
have
been
a
strong
tendency
to
go
after
strange
gods
with
whose
worship
roman
soldiers
had
made
acquaintance
in
the
course
of
their
numerous
eastern
campaigns
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
that
no
less
than
four
times
in
a
single
decade
the
worship
of
isis
had
to
be
suppressed
in
and
in
the
year
we
are
told
that
the
consul
aemilius
paullus
a
conservative
of
the
old
type
actually
threw
off
his
toga
praetexta
and
took
an
axe
to
begin
destroying
the
temple
because
no
workmen
could
be
found
to
venture
on
the
work
these
are
indeed
strange
times
the
beautiful
religion
of
isis
which
assuredly
had
some
power
to
purify
a
man
and
strengthen
his
conscience
was
to
be
driven
out
of
a
city
where
the
old
local
religion
had
never
had
any
such
power
and
where
the
masses
were
now
left
without
a
particle
of
aid
or
comfort
from
any
religious
source
the
story
seems
to
ring
true
and
gives
us
a
most
valuable
glimpse
into
the
mental
condition
of
the
roman
workman
of
the
time
of
such
foreign
worships
and
of
the
general
neglect
of
the
old
cults
cicero
tells
us
nothing
we
have
to
learn
or
to
guess
at
these
facts
from
evidence
supplied
by
later
writers
his
interest
in
religious
practice
was
confined
to
ceremonies
which
had
some
political
importance
he
was
himself
an
augur
and
was
much
pleased
with
his
election
to
that
ancient
college
but
like
most
other
augurs
of
the
time
he
knew
nothing
of
augural
science
and
only
cared
to
speculate
philosophically
on
the
question
whether
it
is
possible
to
foretell
the
future
he
looked
upon
the
right
of
the
magistrate
to
observe
the
heaven
as
a
part
of
an
excellent
constitution
and
could
not
forgive
caesar
for
refusing
in
to
have
his
legislation
paralysed
by
the
fanatical
declarations
of
his
colleague
that
he
was
going
to
look
for
lightning
he
firmly
believed
in
the
value
of
the
of
the
state
in
his
treatise
on
the
constitution
he
devotes
a
whole
book
to
this
religious
side
of
constitutional
law
and
gives
a
sketch
of
it
in
language
from
which
it
appears
that
he
entirely
accepted
the
duty
of
the
state
to
keep
the
citizen
in
right
relation
to
the
gods
on
whose
his
welfare
depended
he
seems
never
to
have
noticed
that
the
state
was
neglecting
this
duty
and
that
as
we
saw
just
now
temples
and
cults
were
falling
into
decay
strange
forms
of
religion
pressing
in
such
things
did
not
interest
him
in
public
life
the
state
religion
was
to
him
a
piece
of
the
constitution
to
be
maintained
where
it
was
clearly
essential
in
his
own
study
it
was
a
matter
of
philosophical
discussion
in
his
young
days
he
was
intimate
with
the
famous
pontifex
maximus
mucius
scaevola
who
held
that
there
were
three
religions
that
of
the
poets
that
of
the
philosophers
and
that
of
the
statesman
of
which
the
last
must
be
accepted
and
acted
on
whether
it
be
true
or
not
cicero
could
hardly
have
complained
if
this
saying
had
been
attributed
to
himself
this
attitude
of
mind
the
combination
of
perfect
freedom
of
thought
with
full
recognition
of
the
legal
obligations
of
the
state
and
its
citizens
in
matters
of
religion
is
not
difficult
for
any
one
to
understand
who
is
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
the
ius
divinum
and
the
priesthood
administering
it
that
ius
divinum
was
a
part
of
the
ius
civile
the
law
of
the
roman
as
the
ius
civile
exclusive
of
the
ius
divinum
regulated
the
relations
of
citizen
to
citizen
so
did
the
ius
divinum
regulate
the
relations
of
the
citizen
to
the
deities
of
the
community
the
priesthoods
administering
this
law
consisted
not
of
sacrificing
priests
attached
to
the
cult
of
a
particular
god
and
temple
but
of
lay
officials
in
charge
of
that
part
of
the
law
of
the
state
it
was
no
concern
of
theirs
so
indeed
they
might
quite
well
argue
whether
the
gods
really
existed
or
not
provided
the
law
were
maintained
when
in
clodius
was
caught
in
disguise
at
the
women
festival
of
the
bona
dea
the
pontifices
declared
the
act
to
be
crime
against
the
ius
divinum
but
we
may
doubt
whether
any
of
those
pontifices
really
believed
in
the
existence
of
such
a
deity
the
idea
of
the
was
still
so
strong
in
the
mind
of
every
true
roman
his
conservative
instincts
were
so
powerful
that
long
after
all
real
life
had
left
the
divine
inhabitants
of
his
city
so
that
they
survived
only
as
the
dead
stalks
of
plants
that
had
once
been
green
and
flourishing
he
was
quite
capable
of
being
horrified
at
any
open
contempt
of
them
and
he
was
right
as
augustus
afterwards
saw
clearly
for
the
masses
who
had
no
share
in
the
education
described
in
the
sixth
chapter
who
knew
nothing
of
greek
literature
or
philosophy
and
were
full
of
superstitious
fancies
were
already
losing
confidence
in
the
authorities
set
over
them
and
in
their
power
to
secure
the
of
the
gods
and
their
favour
in
matters
of
material
this
is
the
only
way
in
which
we
can
satisfactorily
account
for
the
systematic
efforts
of
augustus
to
renovate
the
old
religious
rites
and
priesthoods
and
we
can
fairly
argue
back
from
it
to
the
tendencies
of
the
generation
immediately
before
him
he
knew
that
the
proletariate
of
rome
and
italy
still
believed
as
their
ancestors
had
always
believed
that
state
and
individual
would
alike
suffer
unless
the
gods
were
properly
propitiated
and
that
in
order
to
keep
them
quiet
and
comfortable
the
sense
of
duty
to
the
gods
must
be
kept
alive
even
among
those
who
had
long
ceased
to
believe
in
them
it
was
fortunate
indeed
for
augustus
that
he
found
in
the
great
poet
of
mantua
one
who
was
in
some
sense
a
prophet
as
well
as
a
poet
who
could
urge
the
roman
by
an
imaginative
example
to
return
to
a
living
pietas
not
merely
to
the
old
religious
forms
but
to
the
intelligent
sense
of
duty
to
god
and
man
which
had
built
up
his
character
and
his
empire
in
cicero
day
there
was
also
a
great
poet
he
too
in
some
sense
a
prophet
but
lucretius
could
only
appeal
to
the
roman
to
shake
off
the
slough
of
his
old
religion
and
such
an
appeal
was
at
the
time
both
futile
and
dangerous
looking
at
the
matter
historically
and
not
theologically
we
ought
to
sympathise
with
the
attitude
of
cicero
and
scaevola
towards
the
religion
of
the
state
it
was
based
on
a
statesmanlike
instinct
and
had
it
been
possible
for
that
instinct
to
express
itself
practically
in
a
positive
policy
like
that
of
augustus
instead
of
showing
itself
in
philosophical
treatises
like
the
or
on
occasional
moments
of
danger
like
that
of
the
bona
dea
sacrilege
it
is
quite
possible
that
much
mischief
might
have
been
averted
but
in
that
generation
no
one
had
the
shrewdness
or
experience
of
augustus
and
no
one
but
julius
had
the
necessary
free
hand
and
we
may
be
almost
sure
that
julius
pontifex
maximus
though
he
was
was
entirely
unfitted
by
nature
and
experience
to
undertake
a
work
that
called
for
such
delicate
handling
such
insight
into
the
working
of
the
ignorant
italian
mind
this
attitude
of
inconsistency
and
compromise
must
seem
to
a
modern
unsatisfactory
and
strained
and
he
turns
with
relief
to
the
courageous
outspokenness
of
the
great
poem
of
lucretius
on
the
nature
of
things
of
which
the
main
object
was
to
persuade
the
romans
to
renounce
for
good
all
the
mass
of
superstition
in
which
he
included
the
religion
of
the
state
by
which
their
minds
were
kept
in
a
prison
of
darkness
terror
and
ignorance
lucretius
took
no
part
whatever
in
public
life
he
could
afford
to
be
in
earnest
he
felt
no
shadow
of
responsibility
for
the
welfare
of
the
state
as
such
the
epicurean
tenets
which
he
held
so
passionately
had
always
ranked
the
individual
before
the
community
and
suggested
a
life
of
individual
quietism
lucretius
in
his
study
could
contemplate
the
rerum
natura
without
troubling
himself
about
the
natura
hominum
as
it
existed
in
the
italy
of
his
day
felix
qui
potuit
rerum
cognoscere
causas
so
wrote
of
him
his
great
successor
and
admirer
yet
added
with
a
tinge
of
pathos
which
touches
us
even
now
fortunatus
et
ille
deos
qui
novit
agrestes
even
at
the
present
day
an
uncompromising
unbeliever
may
be
touched
by
the
simple
worship
half
pagan
though
it
may
seem
to
him
of
a
village
in
the
apennines
but
in
the
eyes
of
lucretius
all
worship
seemed
prompted
by
fear
and
based
on
ignorance
of
natural
law
virgil
tender
and
sympathetic
soul
went
out
to
the
peasant
as
he
prayed
to
his
gods
for
plenty
or
prosperity
as
it
went
out
to
all
living
creatures
in
trouble
or
in
joy
but
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
lucretius
was
a
great
religious
poet
he
was
a
prophet
in
deadly
earnest
calling
men
to
renounce
their
errors
both
of
thought
and
conduct
he
saw
around
him
a
world
full
of
wickedness
and
folly
a
world
of
vanity
vexation
fear
ambition
cruelty
and
lust
he
saw
men
fearing
death
and
fearing
the
gods
overvaluing
life
yet
weary
of
it
unable
to
use
it
well
because
steeped
in
ignorance
of
the
wonderful
working
of
nature
he
saw
them
as
we
have
already
seen
them
the
helpless
victims
of
ambition
and
avarice
ever
like
sisyphus
rolling
the
stone
uphill
and
never
reaching
the
summit
of
cruelty
and
bloodshed
in
civil
strife
that
age
had
seen
enough
and
on
this
too
the
poet
dwells
with
bitter
emphasis
on
the
unwholesome
luxury
and
restlessness
of
the
upper
classes
and
on
their
unrestrained
indulgence
of
bodily
appetites
in
his
magnificent
scorn
he
probably
exaggerated
the
evils
of
his
day
yet
we
have
seen
enough
in
previous
chapters
to
suggest
that
he
was
not
a
mere
pessimist
there
is
no
trace
in
his
poem
of
cynicism
or
of
a
soured
temperament
we
may
be
certain
that
he
was
absolutely
convinced
of
the
truth
of
all
he
wrote
so
far
lucretius
may
be
called
a
religious
poet
in
that
with
profound
conviction
and
passionate
utterance
he
denounced
the
wickedness
of
his
age
and
like
the
hebrew
prophets
called
on
mankind
to
put
away
their
false
gods
and
degrading
superstitions
and
learn
the
true
secret
of
guidance
in
this
life
it
is
only
when
we
come
to
ask
what
that
secret
was
that
we
feel
that
this
extraordinary
man
knew
far
too
little
of
ordinary
human
nature
to
be
either
a
religious
reformer
or
an
effective
prophet
as
sellar
has
said
of
him
he
had
no
sympathy
with
human
activity
his
secret
the
remedy
for
all
the
world
evil
and
misery
was
only
a
philosophical
creed
which
he
had
learnt
from
epicurus
and
democritus
his
profound
belief
in
it
is
one
of
the
most
singular
facts
in
literary
history
no
man
ever
put
such
poetic
passion
into
a
dogma
and
no
such
imperious
dogma
was
ever
built
upon
a
scientific
theory
of
the
universe
he
seems
to
have
combined
two
italian
types
of
character
which
never
have
been
united
before
or
since
that
of
the
ecclesiastic
earnest
and
dogmatic
seeing
human
nature
from
a
doctrinal
platform
not
working
and
thinking
with
it
and
secondly
the
poetic
type
of
which
dante
is
the
noblest
example
perfectly
clear
and
definite
in
inward
and
outward
vision
and
illuminating
all
that
it
touches
with
an
indescribable
glow
of
pure
poetic
imagination
lucretius
secret
then
is
knowledge
not
the
dilettanteism
of
the
day
but
real
scientific
knowledge
of
a
single
philosophical
attempt
to
explain
the
universe
the
atomic
theory
of
the
epicurean
school
democritus
and
epicurus
are
the
only
saviours
of
this
lucretius
never
had
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
as
the
result
of
this
knowledge
the
whole
supernatural
and
spiritual
world
of
fancy
vanishes
together
with
all
futile
hopes
or
fears
of
a
future
life
the
gods
if
they
exist
will
cease
to
be
of
any
importance
to
mankind
as
having
no
interest
in
him
and
doing
him
neither
good
nor
harm
chimaeras
portents
ghosts
death
and
all
that
frightens
the
ignorant
and
paralyses
their
energies
will
vanish
in
the
pure
light
of
this
knowledge
man
will
have
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
but
himself
nor
indeed
need
he
fear
himself
when
he
has
mastered
the
truth
by
that
time
as
the
scales
of
fear
fall
from
his
eyes
his
moral
balance
will
be
recovered
the
blind
man
will
see
what
will
he
see
what
is
the
moral
standard
that
will
become
clear
to
him
the
sanction
of
right
living
that
will
grip
his
conscience
it
is
simply
the
conviction
that
as
this
life
is
all
we
have
in
past
present
or
future
it
be
used
after
all
then
lucretius
is
reduced
to
ordinary
moral
suasion
and
finds
no
new
power
or
sanction
that
could
keep
erring
human
nature
in
the
right
path
and
we
must
sadly
allow
that
no
real
moral
end
is
enunciated
by
him
his
ideal
seems
to
be
quietism
in
this
life
and
annihilation
afterwards
it
is
a
purely
rule
of
life
it
is
not
even
a
social
creed
neither
family
nor
state
seems
to
have
any
part
in
it
much
less
the
unfortunate
in
this
life
the
poor
and
the
suffering
the
poet
never
mentions
slavery
or
the
crowded
populations
of
great
cities
it
might
almost
be
called
a
creed
of
fatalism
in
which
natura
plays
much
the
same
part
as
fortuna
did
in
the
creed
of
many
less
noble
spirits
of
that
age
nature
fights
on
we
can
not
resist
her
and
can
not
improve
on
her
it
is
better
to
acquiesce
and
obey
than
to
try
and
rule
her
thus
lucretius
remedy
fails
utterly
it
is
that
of
an
aristocratic
intellect
not
of
a
saviour
of
mankind
so
far
as
we
know
it
was
entirely
fruitless
like
the
constitution
of
sulla
his
contemporary
the
doctrine
of
lucretius
roused
no
sense
of
loyalty
in
roman
or
italian
because
it
was
constructed
with
imperfect
knowledge
of
the
roman
and
italian
nature
but
it
was
a
noble
effort
of
a
noble
mind
and
apart
from
its
literary
greatness
it
has
incidentally
a
lasting
value
for
all
students
of
religious
history
as
showing
better
than
anything
else
that
has
survived
from
that
age
the
need
of
a
real
consecration
of
morality
by
the
life
and
example
of
a
divine
man
thus
while
the
roman
statesman
found
it
necessary
to
maintain
the
ius
divinum
without
troubling
himself
to
attempt
to
put
any
new
life
into
the
details
of
the
worship
it
prescribed
content
to
let
much
of
it
sink
into
oblivion
as
no
longer
essential
to
the
good
government
of
the
state
the
greatest
poetical
genius
of
the
age
was
proclaiming
in
trumpet
tones
that
if
a
man
would
make
good
use
of
his
life
he
must
abandon
absolutely
and
without
a
scruple
the
old
religious
ideas
of
the
world
but
there
was
another
school
of
thought
which
had
long
been
occupied
with
these
difficulties
and
had
reached
conclusions
far
better
suited
than
the
dogmatism
of
lucretius
to
the
conservative
character
of
the
roman
mind
for
it
found
a
place
for
the
deities
of
the
state
and
therefore
for
the
ius
divinum
in
a
philosophical
system
already
widely
accepted
by
educated
men
this
school
may
be
described
as
stoic
though
its
theology
was
often
accepted
by
men
who
did
not
actually
call
themselves
stoics
for
example
by
cicero
himself
who
as
an
adherent
of
the
new
academy
the
school
which
repudiated
dogmatism
and
occupied
itself
with
dialectic
and
criticism
was
perfectly
entitled
to
adopt
the
tenets
of
other
schools
if
he
thought
them
the
most
convincing
its
most
elaborate
exponent
in
this
period
was
varro
and
behind
both
varro
and
cicero
there
stands
the
great
figure
of
the
rhodian
posidonius
of
whose
writings
hardly
anything
has
come
down
to
us
it
is
worth
while
to
trace
briefly
the
history
of
this
school
at
rome
for
it
is
in
itself
extremely
interesting
as
an
attempt
to
reconcile
the
old
theology
if
the
term
may
be
used
with
philosophical
thought
and
it
probably
had
an
appreciable
influence
on
the
later
stoicism
of
the
empire
we
must
go
back
for
a
moment
to
the
period
succeeding
the
war
with
hannibal
the
awful
experience
of
that
war
had
done
much
to
discredit
the
old
roman
religious
system
which
had
been
found
insufficient
of
itself
to
preserve
the
state
the
people
excited
and
despairing
had
been
quieted
by
what
may
be
called
new
religious
prescriptions
innumerable
examples
of
which
are
to
be
found
in
livy
books
the
sibylline
books
were
constantly
consulted
and
supplicationes
in
which
greek
deities
were
prominent
were
ordered
and
carried
out
finally
in
there
was
brought
to
rome
the
sacred
stone
of
the
magna
mater
idaea
the
great
deity
of
pessinus
in
phrygia
and
a
festival
was
established
in
her
honour
called
by
the
greek
name
megalesia
all
this
means
as
can
be
seen
clearly
from
livy
language
that
the
governing
classes
were
trying
to
quiet
the
minds
of
the
people
by
convincing
them
that
no
effort
was
being
spared
to
set
right
their
relations
with
the
unseen
powers
they
had
invoked
in
vain
their
own
local
and
native
deities
and
had
been
compelled
to
seek
help
elsewhere
they
had
found
their
own
narrow
system
of
religion
quite
inadequate
to
express
their
religious
experience
of
the
last
twenty
years
and
indeed
that
old
system
of
religion
never
really
recovered
from
the
discredit
thus
cast
on
it
the
temper
of
the
people
is
well
shown
by
the
rapidity
with
which
the
orgiastic
worship
of
the
greek
dionysus
spread
over
italy
a
few
years
later
and
the
fact
that
it
was
allowed
to
remain
though
under
strict
supervision
shows
that
the
state
religion
no
longer
had
the
power
to
satisfy
the
cravings
of
the
masses
and
the
educated
class
too
was
rapidly
coming
under
the
influence
of
greek
thought
which
could
hardly
act
otherwise
than
as
a
solvent
of
the
old
religious
ideas
ennius
the
great
literary
figure
of
this
period
was
the
first
to
strike
a
direct
blow
at
the
popular
belief
in
the
efficacy
of
prayer
and
sacrifice
by
openly
declaring
that
the
gods
did
not
interest
themselves
in
mankind
the
same
epicurean
doctrine
preached
afterwards
by
lucretius
it
may
indeed
be
doubted
whether
this
doctrine
became
popular
or
acceptable
even
to
the
cultured
classes
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
same
man
who
did
more
than
any
one
before
virgil
to
glorify
the
roman
character
and
dominion
was
the
first
to
impugn
the
belief
that
rome
owed
her
greatness
to
her
divine
inhabitants
but
in
the
next
generation
there
arrived
in
rome
a
man
whose
teaching
had
so
great
an
influence
on
the
best
type
of
educated
roman
that
as
we
have
already
said
he
may
almost
be
regarded
as
a
missionary
we
do
not
know
for
certain
whether
panaetius
wrote
or
taught
about
the
nature
or
existence
of
the
gods
but
we
do
know
that
he
discussed
the
question
of
divination
in
a
work
greek
peri
pronoias
where
he
could
hardly
have
avoided
the
subject
in
any
case
the
stoic
doctrines
which
he
held
themselves
ultimately
derived
from
plato
and
the
old
academy
were
found
capable
in
the
hands
of
his
great
successor
posidonius
of
rhodes
of
supplying
a
philosophical
basis
for
the
activity
as
well
as
the
existence
of
the
gods
these
men
it
must
be
repeated
were
not
merely
professed
philosophers
but
men
of
the
world
travellers
writing
on
a
great
variety
of
subjects
they
were
profoundly
interested
like
polybius
in
the
roman
character
and
government
they
became
intimate
with
the
finer
roman
minds
from
scipio
the
younger
to
cicero
and
varro
and
seem
to
have
seen
clearly
that
the
old
rigid
stoicism
must
be
widened
and
humanised
and
its
ethical
and
theological
aspects
modified
if
it
were
to
gain
a
real
hold
on
the
practical
roman
understanding
we
have
already
seen
how
their
modified
stoic
ethics
acted
for
good
on
the
best
romans
of
our
period
in
theology
also
they
left
a
permanent
mark
on
roman
thought
posidonius
wrote
a
work
on
the
gods
which
formed
the
basis
of
the
speculative
part
of
varro
and
almost
certainly
also
of
the
second
book
of
cicero
de
other
philosophers
of
the
period
even
if
not
professed
stoics
may
have
discussed
the
same
subjects
in
their
lectures
and
writings
arriving
at
conclusions
of
the
same
kind
it
is
chiefly
from
the
fragments
of
varro
work
that
we
learn
something
of
the
stoic
attempt
to
harmonise
the
old
religious
beliefs
with
philosophic
theories
of
the
universe
varro
following
his
teacher
held
the
stoic
doctrine
of
the
the
divine
principle
permeating
all
material
things
which
in
combination
with
them
constitutes
the
universe
and
is
nature
reason
god
destiny
or
whatever
name
the
philosopher
might
choose
to
give
it
the
universe
is
divine
the
various
parts
of
it
are
therefore
also
divine
in
virtue
of
this
informing
principle
now
in
the
sixteenth
book
of
his
great
work
varro
this
stoic
theory
with
the
religion
of
the
state
as
it
existed
in
his
time
the
chief
gods
represented
the
in
various
ways
even
the
difference
of
sex
among
the
deities
was
explained
by
regarding
male
gods
as
emanating
from
the
heaven
and
female
ones
from
the
earth
according
to
a
familiar
ancient
idea
of
the
active
and
passive
principle
in
generation
the
stoic
doctrine
of
greek
daimones
was
also
utilised
to
find
an
explanation
for
lares
genii
and
thus
another
character
of
the
old
italian
religious
mind
was
to
be
saved
from
contempt
and
oblivion
the
old
italian
tendency
to
see
the
supernatural
manifesting
itself
in
many
different
ways
expressed
by
adjectival
titles
mars
silvanus
jupiter
elicius
juno
lucina
also
found
an
explanation
in
varro
doctrine
for
the
divine
element
existing
in
sky
earth
sea
or
other
parts
of
the
and
manifesting
itself
in
many
different
forms
of
activity
might
be
thus
made
obvious
to
the
ordinary
human
intellect
without
the
interposition
of
philosophical
terms
at
the
head
of
the
whole
system
was
jupiter
the
greatest
of
roman
gods
whose
title
of
optimus
maximus
might
well
have
suggested
that
no
other
deity
could
occupy
this
place
without
him
it
would
have
been
practically
impossible
for
varro
to
carry
out
his
difficult
and
perilous
task
every
roman
recognised
in
jupiter
the
god
who
condescended
to
dwell
on
the
capitol
in
a
temple
made
with
hands
and
who
beyond
all
other
gods
watched
over
the
destinies
of
the
roman
state
every
roman
also
knew
that
jupiter
was
the
great
god
of
the
heaven
above
him
for
in
many
expressions
of
his
ordinary
speech
he
used
the
god
name
as
a
synonym
for
the
open
sky
the
position
now
accorded
to
the
in
the
new
stoic
system
is
so
curious
and
interesting
that
we
must
dwell
on
it
for
a
moment
varro
held
or
at
any
rate
taught
that
jupiter
was
himself
that
soul
of
the
world
animus
mundi
which
fills
and
moves
the
whole
material
universe
he
is
the
one
universal
causal
agent
from
whom
all
the
forces
of
nature
are
derived
or
he
may
be
called
in
language
which
would
be
intelligible
to
the
ordinary
roman
the
universal
genius
further
he
is
himself
all
the
other
gods
and
goddesses
who
may
be
described
as
parts
or
powers
or
virtues
existing
in
him
and
varro
makes
it
plain
that
he
wishes
to
identify
this
great
god
of
gods
with
the
jupiter
at
rome
whose
temple
was
on
the
capitol
augustine
quotes
him
as
holding
that
the
romans
had
dedicated
the
capitol
to
jupiter
who
by
his
spirit
breathes
life
into
everything
in
the
universe
or
in
less
philosophical
language
the
romans
wish
to
recognise
jupiter
as
king
of
gods
and
men
and
this
is
shown
by
his
sceptre
and
his
seat
on
the
capitol
thus
the
god
who
dwelt
on
the
capitol
and
in
the
temple
which
was
the
of
the
roman
empire
was
also
the
ruler
and
centre
of
the
whole
universe
nay
he
goes
one
step
further
and
identifies
him
with
the
one
god
of
the
monotheistic
peoples
of
the
east
and
in
particular
with
the
god
of
the
jews
thus
varro
had
arrived
with
the
help
of
posidonius
and
the
stoics
at
a
monotheistic
view
of
the
deity
which
is
at
the
same
time
a
kind
of
pantheism
and
yet
strange
to
say
is
able
to
accommodate
itself
to
the
polytheism
of
the
world
but
without
jupiter
god
of
the
heaven
both
for
greeks
and
romans
and
now
too
in
the
eyes
of
both
peoples
the
god
who
watched
over
the
destiny
of
the
roman
empire
this
wonderful
feat
could
not
have
been
performed
the
identification
of
the
with
the
animus
mundi
of
the
stoics
was
not
indeed
a
new
idea
it
may
be
traced
up
stoic
channels
even
to
plato
what
is
really
new
and
astonishing
is
that
it
should
have
been
possible
for
a
conservative
roman
like
varro
in
that
age
of
carelessness
and
doubt
to
bring
the
so
to
speak
down
to
the
roman
capitol
where
his
statue
was
to
be
seen
sitting
between
juno
and
minerva
and
yet
to
teach
the
doctrine
that
he
was
the
same
deity
as
the
jewish
jehovah
and
that
both
were
identical
with
the
stoic
animus
mundi
but
did
varro
also
conceive
of
this
jupiter
as
a
deity
making
for
righteousness
or
acting
as
a
sanction
for
morality
it
would
not
have
been
impossible
or
unnatural
for
a
roman
so
to
think
of
him
for
of
all
the
roman
deities
jupiter
is
the
one
whose
name
from
the
most
ancient
times
had
been
used
in
oaths
and
treaties
and
whose
was
felt
to
be
violated
by
any
public
or
private
breach
of
faith
we
can
not
tell
how
far
varro
himself
followed
out
this
line
of
thought
for
the
fragments
of
his
great
work
are
few
and
far
between
but
we
know
that
the
roman
stoics
saw
in
that
same
universal
power
or
mind
which
varro
identified
with
jupiter
the
source
and
strength
of
law
and
therefore
of
morality
here
it
is
usually
called
reason
the
working
of
the
eternal
and
immutable
mind
of
the
universe
true
law
is
right
reason
says
cicero
in
a
noble
passage
and
goes
on
to
teach
that
this
law
transcends
all
human
codes
of
law
embracing
and
sanctioning
them
all
and
that
the
spirit
inherent
in
it
which
gives
it
its
universal
force
is
god
himself
in
another
passage
written
towards
the
end
of
his
life
and
certainly
later
than
the
publication
of
varro
work
he
goes
further
and
identifies
this
god
with
jupiter
this
law
he
says
came
into
being
simultaneously
with
the
divine
mind
the
stoic
reason
wherefore
that
true
and
paramount
law
commanding
and
forbidding
is
the
right
reason
of
almighty
jupiter
summi
iovis
once
more
in
the
first
book
of
his
treatise
on
the
gods
he
quotes
the
stoic
chrysippus
as
teaching
that
the
eternal
power
which
is
as
it
were
a
guide
in
the
duties
of
life
is
jupiter
himself
it
is
characteristic
of
the
roman
that
he
should
think
in
speculations
like
these
rather
of
the
law
of
his
state
than
of
the
morality
of
the
individual
as
emanating
from
that
right
reason
to
which
he
might
give
the
name
of
jupiter
i
have
been
unable
to
find
a
passage
in
which
cicero
attributes
to
this
deity
the
sanction
for
individual
goodness
though
there
are
many
that
assert
the
belief
that
justice
and
the
whole
system
of
social
life
depend
on
the
gods
and
our
belief
in
them
but
the
roman
had
never
been
conscious
of
individual
duty
except
in
relation
to
his
state
or
to
the
family
which
was
a
living
cell
in
the
organism
of
the
state
in
his
eyes
law
was
rather
the
source
of
morality
than
morality
the
cause
and
the
reason
of
law
and
as
his
religion
was
a
part
of
the
law
of
his
state
and
thus
had
but
an
indirect
connection
with
morality
it
would
not
naturally
occur
to
him
that
even
the
great
jupiter
himself
thus
glorified
as
the
reason
in
the
universe
could
really
help
him
in
the
conduct
of
his
life
individual
it
is
only
as
the
source
of
legalised
morality
that
we
can
think
of
jupiter
as
making
for
righteousness
less
than
years
after
cicero
death
in
the
imagination
of
the
greatest
of
roman
poets
jupiter
was
once
more
brought
before
the
roman
world
and
now
in
a
form
comprehensible
by
all
educated
men
whether
or
no
they
had
dabbled
in
philosophy
what
are
we
to
say
of
the
jupiter
of
the
we
do
not
need
to
read
far
in
the
first
book
of
the
poem
to
find
him
spoken
of
in
terms
which
remind
us
of
varro
o
qui
res
hominumque
deumque
aeternis
regis
imperiis
are
the
opening
words
of
the
address
of
venus
and
when
she
has
finished
olli
subridens
hominum
sator
atque
deorum
vultu
quo
caelum
tempestatesque
serenat
oscula
libavit
natae
dehine
talia
fatur
parce
metu
cytherea
manent
immota
tuorum
fata
tibi
jupiter
is
here
as
in
varro
system
the
prime
cause
and
ruler
of
all
things
and
he
also
holds
in
his
hand
the
destiny
of
rome
and
the
fortunes
of
the
hero
who
was
to
lay
the
first
foundation
of
dominion
it
is
in
the
knowledge
of
his
will
that
aeneas
walks
with
hesitating
steps
in
the
earlier
books
in
the
later
ones
with
assured
confidence
towards
the
goal
that
is
set
before
him
but
the
lines
just
quoted
serve
well
to
show
how
different
is
the
jupiter
of
virgil
from
the
universal
deity
of
the
roman
stoic
beyond
doubt
virgil
had
felt
the
power
of
the
stoic
creed
but
he
was
essaying
an
epic
poem
and
he
could
not
possibly
dispense
with
the
divine
machinery
as
it
stood
in
his
great
homeric
model
his
jupiter
is
indeed
as
has
been
lately
said
a
great
and
wise
god
free
from
the
tyrannical
and
sensuous
characteristics
of
the
homeric
zeus
in
other
words
he
is
a
roman
deity
and
sometimes
acts
and
speaks
like
a
grave
roman
consul
of
the
olden
time
but
still
he
is
an
anthropomorphic
deity
a
purely
human
conception
of
a
personal
in
these
lines
he
smiles
on
his
daughter
venus
and
kisses
her
this
is
the
reason
why
virgil
has
throughout
his
poem
placed
the
fates
or
destiny
in
close
relation
to
him
without
definitely
explaining
that
relation
fate
as
it
appears
in
the
aeneid
is
the
stoic
greek
eimarmenae
applied
to
the
idea
of
rome
and
her
empire
that
stoic
conception
could
not
take
the
form
of
jupiter
as
in
varro
hands
for
the
god
had
to
be
modelled
on
the
homeric
pattern
not
on
the
stoic
it
is
perhaps
not
going
too
far
to
say
that
the
god
as
a
theological
conception
never
recovered
from
this
treatment
any
chance
he
ever
had
of
becoming
the
centre
of
a
real
religious
system
was
destroyed
by
the
aeneid
the
of
whose
hero
is
indeed
nominally
due
to
him
but
in
reality
to
the
decrees
of
fate
while
philosophers
and
poets
were
thus
performing
intellectual
and
imaginative
feats
with
the
gods
of
the
state
the
strong
tendency
to
superstition
untutored
fear
of
the
supernatural
which
had
always
been
characteristic
of
the
italian
peoples
so
far
from
losing
power
was
actually
gaining
it
and
that
not
only
among
the
lower
classes
as
lucretius
mockingly
said
even
those
who
think
and
speak
with
contempt
of
the
gods
will
in
moments
of
trouble
slay
black
sheep
and
sacrifice
them
to
the
manes
this
feeling
of
fear
or
nervousness
which
lies
at
the
root
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
had
been
quieted
in
the
old
days
by
the
prescriptions
of
the
pontifices
and
their
jus
divinum
but
it
was
always
ready
to
break
out
again
as
we
have
seen
in
the
long
and
awful
struggle
of
the
hannibalic
war
it
was
necessary
to
go
far
beyond
the
ordinary
pharmacopoeia
within
reach
of
the
priesthoods
in
order
to
convince
the
people
that
all
possible
means
were
being
taken
for
their
salvation
again
in
this
last
age
of
the
republic
there
are
obvious
signs
that
both
ignorant
and
educated
were
affected
by
the
gloom
and
uncertainty
of
the
times
increasing
uncertainty
in
the
political
world
increasing
doubt
in
the
world
of
thought
very
naturally
combined
to
produce
an
emotional
tendency
which
took
different
forms
in
men
of
different
temperament
we
can
trace
this
in
the
importance
attached
to
omens
portents
dreams
in
a
certain
vague
thought
of
a
future
life
which
takes
a
positive
shape
in
the
deification
of
human
beings
at
the
close
of
the
period
in
something
approaching
to
a
sense
of
sin
of
neglected
duty
bringing
down
upon
state
and
individual
the
anger
of
the
gods
if
we
glance
over
the
latter
part
of
the
book
of
prodigies
compiled
by
the
otherwise
unknown
writer
julius
obsequens
from
the
records
of
the
pontifices
quoted
in
livy
history
we
can
get
a
fair
idea
of
the
kind
of
portent
that
was
troubling
the
popular
mind
they
are
much
the
same
as
they
always
had
been
in
roman
history
earthquakes
monstrous
births
temples
struck
by
lightning
statues
overthrown
wolves
entering
the
city
and
so
on
they
are
extremely
abundant
in
the
terrible
years
of
the
social
and
civil
wars
become
less
frequent
after
the
death
of
sulla
and
break
out
again
in
full
force
with
the
murder
of
caesar
they
were
reported
to
the
pontifices
from
the
places
where
they
were
supposed
to
have
occurred
and
if
thought
worthy
of
expiation
were
entered
in
the
pontifical
books
we
may
suppose
that
they
were
sent
in
chiefly
by
the
uneducated
but
among
men
of
education
we
have
many
examples
of
this
same
nervousness
of
which
two
or
three
must
suffice
sulla
as
we
know
from
his
own
memoirs
which
were
used
directly
or
indirectly
by
plutarch
had
a
strong
vein
of
superstition
in
his
nature
and
made
no
attempt
to
control
it
in
dedicating
his
memoirs
to
lucullus
he
advised
him
to
think
no
course
so
safe
as
that
which
is
enjoined
by
the
greek
daimon
perhaps
his
genius
in
the
night
and
plutarch
tells
us
several
tales
of
portents
on
which
he
acted
evidently
drawn
from
this
same
autobiography
we
are
told
of
him
that
he
always
carried
a
small
image
of
apollo
which
he
kissed
from
time
to
time
and
to
which
he
prayed
silently
in
moments
of
danger
again
cicero
tells
us
a
curious
story
of
himself
varro
and
cato
which
shows
that
those
three
men
of
philosophical
learning
were
quite
liable
to
be
frightened
by
a
prophecy
which
to
us
would
not
seem
to
have
much
claim
to
respect
he
tells
how
when
the
three
were
at
dyrrachium
after
caesar
defeat
there
and
the
departure
of
the
armies
into
thessaly
news
was
brought
them
by
the
commander
of
the
rhodian
fleet
that
a
certain
rower
had
foretold
that
within
thirty
days
greece
would
be
weltering
in
blood
how
all
three
were
terribly
frightened
and
how
a
few
days
later
the
news
of
the
battle
at
pharsalia
reached
them
lastly
we
all
remember
the
vision
which
appeared
to
brutus
on
the
eve
of
the
battle
of
philippi
of
a
huge
and
fearsome
figure
standing
by
him
in
silence
which
shakespeare
has
made
into
the
ghost
of
caesar
and
used
to
unify
his
play
according
to
plutarch
the
epicurean
cassius
as
lucretius
would
have
done
attempted
to
convince
his
friend
on
rational
grounds
that
the
vision
need
not
alarm
him
but
apparently
in
vain
lucretius
had
denied
the
doctrine
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
as
the
cause
of
so
much
of
the
misery
which
he
believed
it
to
be
his
mission
to
avert
caesar
in
the
speech
put
into
his
mouth
by
sallust
in
the
debate
on
the
execution
of
the
conspirators
on
december
seems
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
and
as
cicero
alludes
to
his
words
in
the
speech
with
which
he
followed
caesar
we
may
suppose
that
sallust
was
reporting
him
rightly
the
poet
and
the
statesman
were
not
unlike
in
the
way
in
which
they
looked
at
facts
both
were
of
clear
strong
vision
without
a
trace
of
mysticism
but
such
men
were
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule
cicero
probably
represents
better
the
average
thinking
man
of
his
time
cicero
was
indeed
too
full
of
life
too
deeply
interested
in
the
living
world
around
him
to
think
much
of
such
questions
as
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
as
a
professed
follower
of
the
academic
school
he
assuredly
did
not
hold
any
dogmatic
opinion
on
it
he
was
at
no
time
really
affected
by
pythagoreanism
like
his
friend
nigidius
figulus
whose
works
now
lost
had
a
great
vogue
in
the
later
years
of
cicero
life
and
much
influence
on
the
age
that
followed
in
the
first
book
of
his
tusculan
disputations
cicero
discusses
the
question
from
the
academic
point
of
view
coming
to
no
definite
conclusion
except
that
whether
we
are
immortal
or
not
we
must
be
grateful
to
death
for
releasing
us
from
the
bondage
of
the
body
this
book
was
written
in
the
last
year
of
his
life
but
ten
years
earlier
in
the
beautiful
myth
imitated
from
the
myths
of
plato
which
he
appended
to
his
treatise
he
had
emphatically
asserted
the
doctrine
there
the
spirit
of
the
elder
scipio
appears
to
his
great
namesake
cicero
ideal
roman
and
assures
him
that
the
road
to
heaven
caelum
lies
open
to
those
who
do
their
duty
in
this
life
and
especially
their
duty
to
the
state
know
thyself
to
be
a
god
as
the
god
of
gods
rules
the
universe
so
the
god
within
us
rules
the
body
and
as
that
great
god
is
eternal
so
does
an
eternal
soul
govern
this
frail
body
the
was
an
inspiration
written
under
the
influence
of
plato
at
one
of
those
emotional
moments
of
life
which
make
it
possible
to
say
of
him
that
there
was
a
religious
element
in
his
mind
some
years
later
the
poignancy
of
his
grief
at
the
death
of
his
daughter
tullia
had
the
effect
of
putting
him
again
in
a
strong
emotional
mood
for
many
weeks
he
lived
alone
at
astura
on
the
edge
of
the
pomptine
marshes
out
of
reach
of
all
friends
forbidding
even
his
young
wife
and
her
mother
to
come
near
him
brooding
as
it
would
seem
on
the
survival
of
the
godlike
element
in
his
daughter
these
sad
meditations
took
a
practical
form
which
at
first
astonishes
us
but
is
not
hard
to
understand
when
we
have
to
come
to
know
cicero
well
and
to
follow
the
tendencies
of
thought
in
these
years
he
might
erect
a
tomb
to
her
memory
but
that
would
not
satisfy
him
it
would
not
express
his
feeling
that
the
immortal
godlike
spark
within
her
survived
he
earnestly
entreats
atticus
to
find
and
buy
him
a
piece
of
ground
where
he
can
build
a
a
shrine
to
her
spirit
i
wish
to
have
a
shrine
built
and
that
wish
can
not
be
rooted
out
of
my
heart
i
am
anxious
to
avoid
any
likeness
to
a
tomb
in
order
to
attain
as
nearly
as
possible
to
an
apotheosis
a
little
further
on
he
calls
these
foolish
ideas
but
this
is
doubtless
only
because
he
is
writing
to
atticus
a
man
of
the
world
not
given
to
emotion
or
mysticism
cicero
is
really
speaking
the
language
of
the
italian
mind
for
the
moment
free
from
philosophical
speculation
he
believes
that
his
beloved
dead
lived
on
though
he
could
not
have
proved
it
in
argument
so
firmly
does
he
believe
it
that
he
wishes
others
to
know
that
he
believes
it
and
insists
that
the
shrine
shall
be
erected
in
a
frequented
place
though
the
great
dictator
did
not
believe
in
another
world
he
consented
at
the
end
of
his
life
to
become
jupiter
julius
and
after
his
death
was
duly
canonised
as
divus
and
had
a
temple
erected
to
him
but
the
question
of
the
deification
of
the
caesars
can
not
be
discussed
here
it
is
only
mentioned
as
showing
in
another
way
the
trend
of
thought
in
this
dark
age
of
roman
history
whatever
some
philosophers
may
have
thought
there
can
not
be
a
doubt
that
the
ordinary
roman
believed
in
the
godhead
of
julius
we
saw
in
an
earlier
chapter
with
what
gay
and
heedless
frivolity
young
men
like
caelius
were
amusing
themselves
even
on
the
very
eve
of
civil
war
in
strange
contrast
with
this
is
the
gloom
that
overspread
all
classes
during
the
war
itself
and
more
especially
after
the
assassination
of
the
dictator
caesar
seemed
irresistible
and
godlike
and
men
were
probably
beginning
to
hope
for
some
new
and
more
stable
order
of
things
when
he
was
suddenly
struck
down
and
the
world
plunged
again
into
confusion
and
doubt
and
it
was
not
till
after
the
final
victory
of
octavian
at
actium
and
the
destruction
of
the
elements
of
disunion
with
the
deaths
of
antony
and
cleopatra
that
men
really
began
to
hope
for
better
times
the
literature
of
those
melancholy
years
shows
distinct
signs
of
the
general
depression
which
was
perhaps
something
more
than
weariness
and
material
discomfort
there
was
almost
what
we
may
call
a
dim
sense
of
sin
or
at
least
of
moral
evil
such
a
feeling
though
far
less
real
and
intense
as
that
which
their
prophets
aroused
from
time
to
time
in
the
jewish
people
and
one
not
unknown
in
the
history
of
hellas
the
most
touching
expression
of
this
feeling
is
to
be
found
in
the
preface
which
livy
prefixed
to
his
history
a
wonderful
example
of
the
truth
that
when
a
great
prose
writer
is
greatly
moved
his
language
reflects
his
emotion
in
its
beauty
and
earnestness
every
student
knows
the
sentence
in
which
he
describes
the
gradual
decay
of
all
that
was
good
in
the
roman
character
donec
ad
haec
tempora
quibus
nec
vitia
nostra
nec
remedia
pati
possumus
perventum
est
but
it
is
not
every
student
who
can
recognise
in
it
a
real
sigh
of
despair
an
unmistakable
token
of
the
sadness
of
the
age
in
the
introductory
chapters
which
serve
the
purpose
of
prefaces
to
the
and
of
sallust
we
find
something
of
the
same
sad
tone
but
it
does
not
ring
true
like
livy
exordium
sallust
was
a
man
of
altogether
coarser
fibre
and
seems
to
be
rather
assuming
than
expressing
the
genuine
feeling
of
a
saddened
onlooker
in
one
of
his
earliest
poems
written
perhaps
after
the
perusian
war
of
even
the
lively
horace
was
moved
to
voice
the
prevailing
depression
fancifully
urging
that
the
italian
people
should
migrate
like
the
phocaeans
of
old
to
the
far
west
where
as
sertorius
had
been
told
in
spain
lay
the
islands
of
the
blest
where
the
earth
as
in
the
golden
age
yields
all
her
produce
untilled
iuppiter
ilia
piae
secrevit
litora
genti
ut
inquinavit
aere
tempus
aureum
aere
dehinc
ferro
duravit
saecula
quorum
piis
secunda
vate
me
datur
fuga
it
may
be
as
has
recently
been
suggested
that
the
famous
fourth
eclogue
of
virgil
the
messianic
eclogue
was
in
some
sense
meant
as
an
answer
to
this
poem
of
horace
there
is
no
need
he
seems
to
say
in
that
poem
written
in
the
year
to
seek
the
better
age
in
a
fabled
island
of
the
west
it
is
here
and
now
with
us
the
period
upon
which
italy
is
now
entering
more
than
fulfils
in
real
life
the
dream
of
a
golden
age
a
marvellous
child
is
even
now
coming
into
the
world
who
will
see
and
inaugurate
an
era
of
peace
and
prosperity
darkness
and
despair
will
after
a
while
pass
entirely
away
and
a
regenerate
italy
regenerate
in
religion
and
morals
as
in
fertility
and
wealth
will
lead
the
world
in
a
new
era
of
happiness
and
good
government
but
the
golden
age
so
fondly
hoped
for
so
vaguely
and
poetically
conceived
was
not
to
come
in
the
sense
in
which
virgil
or
any
other
serious
thinker
of
the
day
could
dream
of
it
i
may
conclude
this
chapter
with
a
few
sentences
which
express
this
most
truly
and
eloquently
when
there
is
a
fervent
aspiration
after
better
things
springing
from
a
strong
feeling
of
human
brotherhood
and
a
firm
belief
in
the
goodness
and
righteousness
of
god
such
aspiration
carries
with
it
an
invincible
confidence
that
some
how
some
where
some
when
it
must
receive
its
complete
fulfilment
for
it
is
prompted
by
the
spirit
which
fills
and
orders
the
universe
throughout
its
whole
development
but
if
the
human
organ
of
inspiration
goes
on
to
fix
the
how
the
where
and
the
when
and
attributes
to
some
nearer
object
the
glory
of
the
final
blessedness
then
it
inevitably
falls
into
such
mistakes
as
virgil
and
finds
its
golden
age
in
the
rule
of
the
caesars
which
was
indeed
an
essential
feature
of
christianity
or
perhaps
as
in
later
days
in
the
establishment
of
socialism
or
imperialism
well
for
the
seer
if
he
remembers
that
the
kingdom
of
god
is
within
us
and
that
the
true
golden
age
must
have
its
foundation
in
penitence
for
misdoing
and
be
built
up
in
righteousness
and
loving
kindness
epilogue
these
sketches
of
social
life
at
the
close
of
the
republican
period
have
been
written
without
any
intention
of
proving
a
point
or
any
idea
of
the
extent
of
demoralisation
social
moral
or
political
which
the
roman
people
had
then
reached
but
a
perusal
of
balfour
suggestive
lecture
on
decadence
has
put
me
upon
making
a
very
succinct
diagnosis
of
the
condition
of
the
patient
whose
life
and
habits
i
have
been
describing
the
romans
and
the
italians
with
whom
they
were
now
socially
and
politically
amalgamated
were
not
in
the
last
two
centuries
an
old
or
people
it
is
at
any
rate
certain
that
for
a
century
after
the
war
with
hannibal
rome
and
her
allies
under
the
guidance
of
the
roman
senate
achieved
an
amount
of
work
in
the
way
of
war
and
organisation
such
as
has
hardly
been
performed
by
any
people
before
or
since
and
even
in
the
period
dealt
with
in
this
book
in
spite
of
much
cause
for
misgiving
at
home
the
work
done
by
roman
and
italian
armies
both
in
east
and
west
shows
beyond
doubt
that
under
healthy
discipline
the
native
vigour
of
the
population
could
assert
itself
we
must
not
forget
however
severely
we
may
condemn
the
way
in
which
the
work
was
done
that
it
is
to
these
armies
in
all
human
probability
that
we
owe
not
only
the
preservation
of
culture
and
civilisation
but
the
opportunity
for
further
progress
the
establishment
of
definite
frontiers
by
pompeius
and
caesar
and
afterwards
by
augustus
and
tiberius
brought
peace
to
the
region
of
the
mediterranean
and
with
it
made
possible
the
development
of
roman
law
and
the
growth
of
a
new
and
religion
but
peoples
like
individuals
if
offered
opportunities
of
doing
themselves
physical
or
moral
damage
are
only
too
ready
to
accept
them
time
after
time
in
these
chapters
we
have
had
to
look
back
to
the
age
following
the
war
with
hannibal
in
order
to
see
what
those
opportunities
were
and
in
each
case
we
have
found
the
acceptance
rapid
and
eager
we
have
seen
wealth
coming
in
suddenly
and
misused
available
in
an
abnormal
degree
and
utilised
with
results
in
the
main
unfortunate
the
population
of
the
city
increasing
far
too
quickly
yet
the
difficulties
arising
from
this
increase
either
ignored
or
misapprehended
we
have
noticed
the
decay
of
wholesome
family
life
of
the
useful
influence
of
the
roman
matron
of
the
old
forms
of
the
state
religion
the
misconception
of
the
true
end
of
education
the
result
partly
of
greek
culture
partly
of
political
life
and
to
these
may
perhaps
be
added
an
increasing
liability
to
diseases
and
especially
to
malaria
arising
from
economic
blunders
in
italy
and
insanitary
conditions
of
life
in
the
city
all
these
opportunities
of
damage
to
the
fibre
of
the
people
had
been
freely
accepted
and
with
the
result
that
in
the
age
of
cicero
we
can
not
mistake
the
signs
and
symptoms
of
degeneracy
but
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
this
degeneracy
had
as
yet
gone
too
far
to
be
arrested
it
was
assuredly
not
that
degeneracy
of
senility
which
balfour
is
inclined
to
postulate
as
an
explanation
of
decadence
so
far
as
i
can
judge
the
romans
were
at
that
stage
when
in
spite
of
unhealthy
conditions
of
life
and
obstinate
persistence
in
dangerous
habits
it
was
not
too
late
to
reform
and
recover
to
me
the
main
interest
of
the
history
of
the
early
empire
lies
in
seeking
the
answer
to
the
question
how
far
that
recovery
was
made
if
these
chapters
should
have
helped
any
student
to
prepare
the
ground
for
the
solution
of
this
problem
their
object
will
have
been

the
subject
of
the
public
baths
at
rome
properly
belongs
to
the
period
of
the
empire
and
is
too
extensive
to
be
treated
in
a
chapter
on
the
daily
life
of
the
roman
of
cicero
time
public
baths
did
exist
in
rome
already
but
we
hear
very
little
of
them
which
shows
that
they
were
not
as
yet
an
indispensable
adjunct
of
social
life
but
the
fact
that
seneca
in
the
letter
already
quoted
describes
the
aediles
as
testing
the
heat
of
the
water
with
their
hands
shows
that
the
baths
were
public
that
they
were
of
hot
water
and
not
as
later
of
hot
air
the
latter
invention
is
said
to
have
come
in
