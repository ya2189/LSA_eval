introduction
what
a
tribute
to
the
worth
of
woman
are
the
names
by
which
she
is
enshrined
in
common
speech
what
tender
associations
halo
the
names
of
mother
and
it
must
never
be
forgotten
that
the
dearest
most
sacred
of
these
names
are
in
origin
connected
with
the
dignity
of
service
in
early
speech
the
wife
or
woman
was
the
weaver
whose
care
it
was
to
clothe
the
family
as
it
was
the
husband
duty
to
feed
it
or
to
provide
the
materials
of
sustenance
the
mother
or
matron
was
named
from
the
most
tender
and
sacred
of
human
functions
the
nursing
of
the
babe
the
daughter
from
her
original
duty
in
the
pastoral
age
of
milking
the
cows
the
lady
was
from
the
social
obligations
entailed
on
the
prosperous
woman
of
or
dispensing
charity
to
the
less
fortunate
as
dame
madame
madonna
in
the
old
days
of
aristocracy
she
bore
equal
rank
with
the
lord
and
master
and
carried
down
to
our
better
democratic
age
the
of
civic
and
family
rights
and
duties
modern
science
and
invention
civic
and
economic
progress
the
growth
of
humanitarian
ideas
and
the
approach
to
christian
unity
are
all
combining
to
give
woman
and
woman
work
a
central
place
in
the
social
order
the
vast
machinery
of
government
especially
in
the
new
activities
of
the
agricultural
and
labor
departments
applied
to
investigations
and
experiments
into
the
questions
of
pure
food
household
economy
and
employments
suited
to
woman
is
now
directed
more
than
ever
before
to
the
uplifting
of
american
homes
and
the
assistance
of
the
homemakers
these
researches
are
at
the
call
of
every
housewife
however
to
save
her
the
bewilderment
of
selection
from
so
many
useful
suggestions
and
the
digesting
of
voluminous
directions

fundamental

of

as
published
by
the
government
departments
are
here
presented
with
the
permission
of
the
respective
authorities
together
with
many
other

of
utilitarian
character

part
benjamin
hathaway
the
the
question
of
celibacy
is
too
large
and
complicated
to
be
here
discussed
in
its
moral
and
sociological
aspects
it
is
a
condition
that
confronts
us
must
be
accepted
and
the
best
made
of
it
whether
by
economic
compulsion
or
personal
preference
it
is
a
fact
that
a
large
number
of
american
men
remain
bachelors
and
a
corresponding
number
of
american
women
content
themselves
with
a
life
of
single
blessedness
it
is
a
tendency
of
modern
life
that
marriage
be
deferred
more
and
more
to
a
later
period
of
maturity
accordingly
the
period
of
spinsterhood
is
an
important
one
for
consideration
it
is
a
question
of
individual
mental
attitude
whether
the
period
be
viewed
by
the
single
woman
as
a
preparation
for
possible
marriage
or
as
the
determining
of
a
permanent
condition
of
life
in
either
case
the
problem
before
her
is
to
choose
like
hathaway
heroine
the
better
part
the
single
woman
has
an
advantage
over
her
married
sister
in
freedom
of
choice
of
and
service
to
others
says
george
eliot
of
the
wife
a
woman
lot
is
made
for
her
by
the
love
she
accepts
the
bachelor
girl
on
the
other
hand
has
virtually
all
the
liberty
of
the
man
whom
her
name
indicates
that
she
emulates
to
the
unmarried
woman
especially
the
one
who
may
subsequently
marry
education
in
the
broad
sense
of
and
development
is
of
primary
importance
the
question
of
being
should
take
precedence
over
doing
although
not
to
the
exclusion
of
the
latter
for
character
is
best
formed
by
action
but
all
her
studies
occupations
even
her
pastimes
should
be
pursued
with
the
main
purpose
of
making
herself
the
ideal
woman
such
an
one
as
wordsworth
describes
one
with
the
reason
firm
the
temperate
will
endurance
foresight
strength
and
skill
a
perfect
woman
nobly
planned
to
warn
to
comfort
and
command
and
yet
a
spirit
still
and
bright
with
something
of
angelic
light
it
is
an
obviously
true
and
therefore
a
trite
observation
that
no
one
woman
or
man
should
consider
that
education
using
the
term
broadly
stopped
with
graduation
from
school
or
college
but
the
statement
that
a
grown
person
who
has
not
settled
down
to
some
particular
life
work
such
as
is
often
the
case
with
a
young
unmarried
woman
should
continue
at
least
one
serious
will
not
be
so
generally
accepted
or
acceptable
yet
in
no
other
way
may
that
mental
discipline
be
obtained
which
is
necessary
to
the
mature
development
of
character
neglect
to
cultivate
the
ability
to
go
down
to
the
root
of
a
subject
to
observe
it
in
its
relations
and
to
apply
it
practically
will
inevitably
lead
to
superficial
consideration
of
every
subject
and
even
ignorance
of
the
fact
that
this
is
superficial
consideration
as
a
practical
result
the
person
will
drift
through
life
rudderless
the
sport
of
circumstance
she
will
act
by
impulse
and
chance
and
be
continually
at
a
loss
how
to
correct
her
errors
the
shallowness
with
which
women
as
a
class
are
charged
is
due
to
the
fact
that
their
aim
in
life
for
a
considerable
period
not
having
been
fixed
by
marriage
or
choice
of
a
profession
they
do
not
substitute
some
definite
interest
for
such
remissness
and
so
form
the
habit
of
intellectual
laziness
the
study
which
an
unmarried
and
unemployed
woman
should
pursue
may
be
anything
worthy
of
thought
but
preferably
a
practical
subject
at
which
if
necessary
the
woman
is
ready
to
earn
her
living
many
a
family
has
been
saved
from
financial
ruin
by
a
daughter
studying
the
business
or
the
profession
of
the
father
and
upon
his
breakdown
from
becoming
his
assistant
or
in
the
case
of
his
death
even
taking
his
place
as
the
family
in
these
days
when
farming
is
becoming
more
and
more
a
question
of
the
farmer
management
and
less
and
less
of
his
personal
manual
labor
a
daughter
in
a
family
already
supplied
with
one
or
more
housekeepers
may
as
legitimately
as
a
son
study
the
science
of
agriculture
or
one
of
its
many
branches
such
as
or
dairying
and
with
as
certain
a
prospect
of
success
ample
literature
of
the
most
practical
and
authoritative
nature
on
every
phase
of
farming
may
be
secured
from
the
department
of
agriculture
at
washington
and
the
various
state
universities
offer
special
courses
in
agriculture
available
for
any
one
with
a
education
as
well
as
send
lecturers
to
the
farmer
institutes
throughout
the
state
to
give
examples
of
women
who
have
made
notable
successes
at
farming
and
its
allied
industries
would
be
invidious
since
there
are
so
many
of
them
studies
that
look
to
the
possibility
of
the
student
becoming
a
teacher
are
preeminent
in
the
development
of
mentality
the
science
of
psychology
is
the
foundation
of
the
art
of
pedagogy
and
every
woman
particularly
one
who
may
some
day
be
required
to
teach
should
know
the
operations
of
the
mind
how
it
receives
retains
and
may
best
apply
knowledge
an
essential
companion
of
this
study
is
physiology
the
science
of
the
nature
and
functions
of
the
bodily
organs
together
with
its
corollary
hygiene
the
care
of
the
health
from
ancient
times
psychology
and
physiology
have
been
considered
as
equally
associated
and
of
prime
importance
a
sound
mind
in
a
sound
body
is
an
old
latin
proverb
the
need
of
every
one
to
know
himself
both
in
mind
and
body
was
taught
by
the
earliest
wise
men
of
greece
the
roman
emperor
tiberius
said
that
any
one
who
had
reached
the
age
of
thirty
in
ignorance
of
his
physical
constitution
was
a
fool
a
thought
that
has
been
modernized
with
an
unnecessary
extension
of
the
age
into
the
proverb
at
forty
a
man
is
either
a
fool
or
a
physician
the
study
of
psychology
is
a
basis
for
every
employment
or
activity
which
has
to
deal
with
enlightenment
or
persuasion
of
the
public
the
person
who
would
like
to
become
a
speaker
or
writer
needs
to
begin
with
it
rather
than
with
the
study
of
elocution
or
rhetoric
the
first
thing
essential
for
him
to
know
is
himself
the
second
his
hearers
or
readers
what
is
the
order
of
progress
in
their
enlightenment
even
logical
development
of
a
subject
is
subsidiary
to
the
practical
psychological
order
formal
logic
the
analysis
of
the
process
of
reasoning
is
a
cultural
study
rather
than
a
practical
one
save
in
criticism
both
of
one
own
work
and
another
more
cultural
and
at
the
same
time
more
practical
is
the
study
of
exact
reasoning
in
the
form
of
some
branch
of
mathematics
abraham
lincoln
when
he
rode
the
circuit
as
a
lawyer
carried
with
him
a
geometry
which
he
studied
at
every
opportunity
to
the
mental
training
which
it
gave
him
was
due
his
success
not
only
as
a
lawyer
but
also
as
a
political
orator
every
one
of
his
speeches
was
as
complete
a
demonstration
of
its
theme
as
a
proposition
in
euclid
is
of
its
theorem
lincoln
once
said
that
demonstration
was
the
greatest
word
in
the
language
delineation
of
character
is
the
chief
element
of
fiction
and
herein
literary
aspirants
are
particularly
weak
especially
the
women
far
more
of
whom
than
men
try
their
hand
at
short
stories
and
novels
and
who
are
generally
without
that
preliminary
experience
in
journalism
which
most
of
the
male
writers
have
undergone
it
is
not
enough
for
a
novelist
to
know
life
he
must
also
know
the
literary
aspect
of
life
must
have
the
imaginative
power
to
select
and
adapt
actual
experiences
artistically
young
women
who
write
are
prone
to
record
things
just
as
they
happened
this
is
a
mistake
aristotle
laid
down
the
fundamental
principle
of
creative
work
in
his
statement
that
the
purpose
of
art
is
to
fulfil
the
incomplete
designs
of
nature
that
is
aid
nature
by
using
her
speech
yet
telling
her
story
the
way
she
ought
to
have
told
it
but
did
not
this
is
his
great
doctrine
of
poetic
justice
the
writing
of
children
stories
is
peculiarly
the
province
of
the
woman
author
and
here
because
of
her
knowledge
of
the
mind
of
the
child
she
is
apt
to
be
most
successful
the
best
of
stories
about
children
and
for
children
have
been
written
by
of
these
authors
a
notable
instance
was
the
late
myra
kelly
whose
adaptations
in
story
form
of
her
experiences
as
a
teacher
to
the
foreign
population
of
the
east
side
of
new
york
will
long
remain
as
models
of
their
kind
journalism
is
a
sufficient
field
in
itself
for
a
woman
writer
in
which
to
exercise
her
ability
as
well
as
a
preparation
for
creative
literary
work
the
natural
way
to
enter
it
is
by
becoming
the
local
correspondent
of
one
of
the
newspapers
of
the
region
in
this
work
good
judgment
in
the
choice
of
items
of
news
variety
in
the
manner
of
stating
them
and
logical
order
in
arranging
and
connecting
them
should
be
cultivated
the
writing
of
good
plain
english
rather
than
smart
journalese
should
be
the
aim
stale
vulgar
and
incorrect
phrases
such
as
sundayed
and
in
our
midst
should
be
avoided
there
are
two
tests
in
selecting
a
news
item
will
it
interest
readers
ought
they
to
know
it
when
by
these
tests
an
item
is
proved
to
be
real
news
that
demands
publication
it
should
be
published
regardless
of
a
third
consideration
which
is
too
often
made
a
primary
one
will
it
please
the
persons
concerned
this
consideration
should
have
weight
only
in
regard
to
the
manner
of
its
statement
when
the
news
is
disagreeable
to
the
parties
concerned
it
should
be
told
with
all
kindness
and
charity
thus
the
facts
of
a
crime
should
be
stated
who
was
arrested
for
it
etc
but
there
should
be
no
positive
statement
of
the
guilt
of
the
one
arrested
until
this
has
been
legally
proved
many
a
publisher
has
had
to
pay
heavy
damages
because
he
has
overlooked
or
permitted
to
be
published
an
unwarranted
statement
or
opinion
of
a
reporter
or
correspondent
but
even
though
there
were
no
law
against
libel
the
commandment
against
bearing
false
witness
holds
in
ethics
the
woman
at
home
may
also
become
a
contributor
to
the
newspaper
her
first
articles
should
be
statements
of
fact
on
practical
subjects
such
as
the
results
of
her
own
or
some
neighbor
experiments
in
a
household
matter
of
general
interest
or
reminiscences
of
matters
of
local
history
that
happen
to
be
of
current
interest
thus
when
a
new
church
is
erected
the
history
of
the
old
one
may
be
properly
told
here
the
amateur
journalist
may
practise
herself
in
interviewing
people
after
such
a
preparation
as
this
one
may
confidently
enter
the
active
profession
of
journalism
as
a
reporter
preferably
upon
the
paper
for
which
she
has
been
writing
since
in
entering
any
profession
opportunity
for
improvement
and
advancement
in
it
is
the
first
consideration
the
young
reporter
should
cheerfully
accept
the
low
salary
that
is
paid
beginners
there
is
no
discrimination
on
account
of
sex
in
the
newspaper
world
copy
is
paid
for
according
to
its
amount
and
quality
regardless
of
whether
it
was
written
by
a
woman
or
a
man
women
labor
here
as
elsewhere
under
physical
disabilities
in
comparison
with
men
and
yet
in
compensation
they
have
the
advantage
over
men
in
their
special
adaptation
to
certain
features
of
newspaper
work
such
as
the
interviewing
of
women
writing
household
and
fashion
articles
etc
there
are
more
chances
for
this
kind
of
special
work
in
large
cities
and
here
the
aspiring
newspaper
woman
may
go
when
she
has
proved
her
ability
ida
husted
harper
who
stands
in
the
front
rank
of
newspaper
women
has
tersely
stated
the
duties
a
woman
reporter
must
undertake
and
the
sacrifices
she
must
make
as
follows
the
woman
who
wishes
to
be
a
newspaper
reporter
should
ask
herself
if
she
is
able
to
toil
from
eight
to
fifteen
hours
of
the
day
seven
days
in
the
week
if
she
is
willing
to
take
whatever
assignment
may
be
given
to
go
wherever
sent
to
accomplish
what
she
is
delegated
to
do
at
whatever
risk
or
rebuff
or
inconvenience
to
brave
all
kinds
of
weather
to
give
up
the
frivolities
of
dress
that
women
love
and
confine
herself
to
a
plain
serviceable
suit
to
renounce
practically
the
pleasures
of
social
life
to
put
her
relations
to
others
on
a
business
basis
to
subordinate
personal
desires
and
eliminate
the
to
be
careful
always
to
disarm
prejudice
against
and
create
an
impression
favorable
to
women
in
this
occupation
to
expect
no
favors
on
account
of
sex
to
submit
her
work
to
the
same
standard
by
which
a
man
is
judged
the
salaries
earned
by
women
as
reporters
are
with
a
few
notable
exceptions
not
large
as
low
as
and
a
week
are
paid
to
beginners
from
to
a
week
is
considered
a
fair
salary
and
a
week
an
exceptionally
good
one
for
a
woman
who
has
not
received
recognition
as
a
thoroughly
experienced
reporter
it
is
from
the
ranks
of
newspaper
women
who
have
gone
to
the
large
cities
and
made
a
name
for
themselves
as
capable
reporters
that
the
editorial
staffs
of
the
magazines
are
recruited
as
a
rule
they
obtain
their
introductions
by
magazine
contributions
chiefly
of
special
articles
on
subjects
in
which
they
have
made
themselves
experts
the
salaries
of
these
positions
range
from
a
week
for
assistant
editors
to
and
upward
for
the
heads
of
departments
book
publishers
employ
women
of
this
class
to

upon
their

quite
a
number
of
women
in
new
york
earn
several
thousand
dollars
a
year
each
at
such
work
while
continuing
their
regular
editorial
labors
many
newspaper
women
drift
naturally
into
advertising
writing
which
is
for
when
cleverly
done
since
the
goods
chiefly
advertised
are
largely
for
women
women
have
the
preference
as
writers
of
advertisements
then
too
manufacturers
and
advertising
agents
pay
well
for
ideas
useful
in
promoting
the
commodities
of
themselves
or
their
clients
here
the
woman
at
home
may
find
out
whether
she
has
special
ability
as
an
advertising
writer
by
thinking
out
new
and
catchy
ideas
for
the
promotion
of
articles
which
she
sees
are
widely
advertised
and
mailing
these
to
the
manufacturers
it
is
well
if
she
have
artistic
ability
so
that
she
may
make
designs
of
the
ideas
though
this
is
not
essential
it
is
the
advertising
columns
of
the
newspapers
and
magazines
even
more
than
the
reading
matter
which
give
a
demand
for
work
in
illustration
to
the
woman
who
has
talent
rather
than
genius
in
drawing
illustration
and
commercial
art
afford
a
far
safer
field
in
respect
to
remuneration
than
the
making
of
and
if
ability
in
drawing
is
conjoined
with
ability
in
designing
and
writing
advertisements
the
earnings
are
more
than
doubled
since
payment
for
the
individual
drawing
is
more
customary
than
employing
an
artist
at
a
fixed
salary
illustrating
and
the
designing
of
advertisements
can
be
done
at
home
there
are
many
young
girls
just
out
of
the
who
earn
from
to
a

by
such
akin
to
this
work
is
the
designing
of
for
which
publishers
pay
from

a
more
mechanical
nature

making
the

for

and
the

paid
are
low
a

the
rule

a

the

and

lack

doubling

against
this
the

enthusiasm

for
next

the
most
important
part
in
the
development
of
the
coming
generation
there
is
a
general
complaint
that
the
salaries
of
are
too
low
measured
by
the
rewards
of
persons
of
corresponding
ability
in
other
professions
when
however
the
certainty
of
pay
and
the
virtual
assurance
that
the
employment
is
for
life
if
good
service
is
rendered
are
considered
together
with
the
respect
accorded
the
teacher
by
the
community
and
the
fact
that
her
work
necessarily
tends
to
the
cultivation
of
her
mind
the
lot
of
the
must
be
reckoned
as
one
of
the
most
favored
americans
are
more
prone
than
any
other
people
to
spend
money
on
education
and
this
spirit
is
ever
increasing
so
that
the
is
more
certain
than
the
member
of
any
other
profession
that
she
will
be
rewarded
worthily
in
the
future
the
establishment
of
the
carnegie
pension
fund
for
retired
college
professors
is
an
indication
of
this
growing
spirit
as
well
as
the
recent
advance
of
the
salaries
of
public
school
teachers
in
new
york
city
and
elsewhere
in
recognition
of
the
increase
in
the
cost
of
living
to
the
bright
woman
who
is
interested
in
the
study
of
civics
political
economy
and
sociology
there
is
opportunity
to
earn
a

at
home
by
organizing
classes
in
these
subjects
among
the
of
her
town
teachers
of
parliamentary
law
are
in
especial
demand
the
organization
of
a
mock
congress
for
parliamentary
practise
is
the
most
entertaining
as
well
as
the
most
improving
play
in
which
women
can
join
there
is
also
a
demand
among
women
who
seek
an
intellectual
element
in
their
recreation
for
instruction
in
the
games
of
whist
and
chess
is
the
most
popular
largely
because
of
the
desire
to
win
money
and
valuable
prizes
at
the
game
then
too
a
greater
amount
of
time
is
spent
at
it
than
is
legitimate
for
recreation
for
moral
reasons
therefore
the
teaching
of
it
can
not
be
recommended
straight
whist
is
also
played
occasionally
for
money
but
this
practise
happily
is
rapidly
becoming
obsolete
chess
except
among
professionals
is
played
purely
for
sport
and
is
therefore
the
best
of
games
to
study
unfortunately
there
is
very
little
demand
for
instruction
in
it
by
women
nevertheless
it
is
the
best
of
all
games
for
cultivating
the
analytical
power
of
the
mind
a
faculty
in
which
women
as
a
rule
are
weak
this
power
may
with
equal
pleasure
and
greater
profit
be
gained
by
paying
special
attention
in
the
reading
of
books
and
magazines
to
literary
style
and
construction
the
average
reader
assimilates
only
a
small
percentage
of
what
he
reads
the
careful
thought
which
the
author
puts
into
his
manner
of
presentation
no
less
than
into
the
matter
is
appreciated
by
very
few
of
his
readers
and
by
these
only
to
a
limited
extent
especially
is
this
true
of
fiction
if
one
wishes
to
become
an
author
he
should
first
cultivate
this
power
of
criticism
always
accompanying
the
study
by
exercises
in
reconstruction
of
faults
in
the
author
read
thus
wherever
a
sentence
appears
awkward
in
expression
the
reader
should
revise
it
wherever
there
is
a
seeming
error
in
the
logical
development
of
a
subject
or
the
psychological
development
of
a
fictitious
character
he
should
reconstruct
it
nothing
is
so
helpful
to
a
writer
as
thus
humphrey
ward
has
recently
confessed
that
the
happy
ending
of
her
lady
rose
daughter
was
an
artistic
error
false
to
psychology
her
heroine
being
doomed
to
unhappiness
by
her
character
after
creating
his
characters
and
placing
them
in
situations
where
their
individuality
has
proper
scope
for
action
the
author
must
let
them
work
out
their
own
salvation
a
thoroughly
artistic
work
is
marked
throughout
by
the
quality
of
the
inevitable
and
for
this
the
reader
should
always
be
seeking
there
is
no
surer
indication
of
shallowness
than
the
desire
to
read
only
about
pleasant
subjects
and
characters
and
events
it
is
akin
to
the
habit
of
ignoring
the
existence
of
everything
disagreeable
in
life
which
dickens
has
satirized
in
his
character
podsnap
and
podsnappery
exists
among
women
even
more
than
among
men
because
of
their
more
sensitive
emotional
nature
if
women
are
to
join
with
men
in
making
the
world
better
they
must
not
blink
at
the
misery
and
vice
about
them
and
the
evil
elements
in
human
nature
and
society
which
produce
these
to
be
good
and
brave
is
better
for
a
grown
woman
than
to
be
sweet
and
innocent
in
the
limited
sense
of
these
terms
a
woman
like
a
man
should
see
life
steadily
and
see
it
whole
the
foundation
of
a
critical
habit
in
reading
has
a
practical
bearing
inasmuch
as
it
is
a
direct
training
for
the
positions
of
and
manuscript
reader
for
magazine
and
book
publishers
since
women
read
more
than
men
the
woman
view
of
a
manuscript
is
often
preferred
by
publishers
therefore
there
are
more
women
than
men
in
the
position
of
literary
adviser
these
are
paid
salaries
ranging
from
to
a
week
manuscripts
are
read
by
the
piece
for
from
to
each
book
reviews
are
paid
for
at
all
prices
from
the
possession
of
the
book
alone
to
the
payment
of
a
cent
a
word
it
is
best
for
the
aspiring
critic
to
practice
herself
on
book
reviews
first
in
these
she
can
with
profit
display
her
power
to
analyze
the
artistic
construction
of
books
and
so
develop
her
abilities
as
a
manuscript
reader
the
knowledge
of
books
and
the
ability
to
digest
their
contents
are
necessary
to
the
making
of
a
library
worker
an
employment
which
the
great
increase
in
libraries
through
the
benefaction
of
andrew
carnegie
and
others
is
offering
to
thousands
of
american
women
the
salaries
are
low
but
in
considering
entering
upon
the
work
weight
should
be
given
to
the
opportunities
for
literary
knowledge
and
culture
it
affords
and
its
refined
surroundings
the
making
of
a
descriptive
catalogue
of
the
home
library
using
the
card
index
system
forms
an
ideal
test
for
the
young
woman
who
is
uncertain
whether
she
has
the
taste
and
ability
required
in
this
sort
of
work
to
the
student
in
the
home
even
though
she
intends
to
follow
some
other
vocation
such
as
teaching
or
writing
such
an
inventory
of
her
intellectual
will
be
invaluable
it
matters
not
how
small
the
library
is
for
intensive
cultivation
is
as
profitable
in
mental
culture
as
in
agriculture
even
such
accomplishments
as
music
and
painting
are
most
cultural
when
pursued
as
if
the
intention
of
the
student
were
to
teach
them
knowledge
of
technique
and
of
the
methods
by
which
its
difficulties
are
overcome
is
the
foundation
of
all
appreciation
of
art
the
only
true
connoisseur
is
the
one
who
can
enter
into
the
delight
felt
by
the
artist
in
creating
his
work
exercise
leads
to
invention
the
ancients
well
said
that
the
contortions
of
the
sibyl
generated
her
inspiration
critics
have
been
sneeringly
defined
as
those
who
have
failed
in
literature
and
art
but
this
is
not
true
of
the
greatest
critics
who
never
carried
their
creative
work
to
the
point
of
success
simply
because
they
had
found
a
better
vocation
in
criticism
before
reaching
such
a
point
what
a
loss
to
the
world
it
would
have
been
had
ruskin
developed
into
a
painter
even
a
great
one
instead
of
the
master
interpreter
and
teacher
of
painting
that
he
did
become
household
employments
such
as
cooking
needlework
as
vocations
for
the
unmarried
woman
no
less
than
the
married
need
only
be
mentioned
here
as
their
appropriateness
for
the
girl
at
home
is
obvious
and
they
are
fully
discussed
elsewhere
in
this
series
it
should
be
suggested
however
that
the
greater
leisure
of
the
unmarried
woman
enables
her
to
try
experiments
in
these
subjects
while
the
married
housewife
is
too
fully
occupied
by
the
routine
of
her
duties
to
undertake
them
indeed
if
a
woman
become
a
notable
cook
after
marriage
it
is
often
a
sign
that
she
is
not
a
notable
wife
or
mother
it
is
an
old
saying
that
my
son
my
son
till
he
gets
him
a
wife
but
my
daughter
my
daughter
all
her
life
by
the
common
bond
of
sex
a
daughter
is
her
mother
natural
companion
in
sympathy
however
separated
from
her
in
distance
therefore
when
she
lives
at
home
what
a
special
obligation
is
there
to
be
her
comfort
and
dependence
even
though
she
acquire
greater
skill
in
household
affairs
she
should
still
resign
herself
to
the
subordinate
place
of
assistant
the
thought
that
she
is
becoming
useless
is
the
chief
dread
of
a
woman
who
has
been
a
managing
worker
all
her
life
and
her
daughter
should
carefully
avoid
bringing
this
to
her
mind
indeed
should
so
act
that
the
ageing
mother
retains
the
management
of
the
house
even
though
her
labors
diminish
in
respect
to
the
direction
of
children
the
elder
daughter
should
take
a
hint
from
the
manner
in
which
the
supplements
rather
than
supplants
the
mother
in
her
care
of
the
young
people
leading
to
a
difference
in
the
kind
of
regard
which
these
feel
for
them
the
sister
should
always
consider
herself
simply
as
the
eldest
most
experienced
of
the
children
and
so
the
natural
monitor
of
the
group
and
when
necessary
the
mediator
with
the
parents
in
a
similar
fashion
the
unmarried
woman
should
act
toward
her
neighbors
who
are
wives
and
mothers
in
matters
where
the
interests
of
children
and
households
are
of
chief
concern
she
should
resign
the
leadership
to
the
married
women
and
after
them
to
the
professional
teachers
religious
social
and
civic
matters
wherein
as
a
church
member
and
a
citizen
she
is
on
an
equal
footing
with
wives
and
teachers
afford
her
ample
scope
for
exercising
her
instinct
for
leadership
every
unmarried
woman
who
lives
alone
should
whether
or
not
she
possess
an
income
have
a
vocation
earnings
and
wages
are
not
alone
good
in
themselves
but
are
an
additional
gratification
in
that
they
supply
a
proof
that
the
earner
service
is
of
worth
to
the
world
some
day
when
social
conditions
are
so
adjusted
that
economic
competition
is
really
free
and
wealth
can
not
be
obtained
save
by
service
money
will
be
a
proper
measure
of
standing
in
the
community
it
is
all
the
more
a
duty
now
both
to
herself
her
class
and
to
society
that
the
woman
who
works
should
contend
to
the
last
cent
for
her
part
of
the
wealth
that
is
created
by
the
business
in
which
she
is
engaged
where
her
work
is
equal
to
a
man
she
should
contend
for
wages
equal
to
his
where
it
is
inferior
she
should
be
willing
to
accept
less
where
superior
she
should
demand
more
in
these
matters
women
are
apt
to
be
either
too
complaisant
or
too
clamorous
they
should
first
be
sure
that
they
are
justified
in
their
claims
and
then
if
right
be
firm
in
their
demands
and
if
wrong
be
resigned
to
abandon
them
the
law
of
supply
and
demand
acting
in
the
labor
market
allots
wages
between
workers
with
natural
justice
certainly
more
equitably
than
the
interested
opinion
either
of
employer
or
employee
it
will
be
seen
that
the
woman
in
business
needs
to
study
the
fundamental
elements
of
political
economy
even
more
than
the
housewife
books
and
magazines
are
filled
with
superficial
obvious
advice
as
to
the
way
in
which
women
as
employees
should
conduct
themselves
toward
their
employers
and
fellow
workers
but
rarely
is
there
a
hint
given
of
the
actual
rights
and
obligations
of
these
relations
upon
which
the
proper
conduct
is
based
employment
is
a
business
contract
between
employer
and
employee
in
which
there
is
no
legal
or
moral
obligation
for
either
party
to
exceed
the
terms
owing
to
an
of
labor
wages
may
be
exceedingly
low
even
down
to
the
starvation
point
but
for
this
condition
the
employer
if
he
be
not
also
a
monopolist
is
not
responsible
indeed
as
employer
his
presence
in
the
labor
market
as
an
element
of
demand
raises
the
market
wage
in
fact
it
is
only
by
his
increasing
his
business
that
he
can
raise
wages
if
he
pay
more
to
his
employees
than
he
needs
to
or
is
profitable
for
him
this
increase
is
not
real
wages
but
a
gratuity
something
no
person
likes
to
take
some
other
class
in
society
created
this
condition
and
it
is
this
class
that
the
workers
should
blame
and
as
citizens
take
measures
against
not
the
employers
indeed
they
should
consider
these
as
their
natural
allies
in
making
better
economic
conditions
accordingly
the
woman
in
business
should
have
sympathy
for
her
employer
who
owing
to
the
prevalent
condition
of
shackled
competition
has
troubles
of
his
own
she
should
aid
him
by
loyal
efficient
work
thus
and
only
thus
establishing
a
moral
claim
upon
him
to
recognize
her
loyalty
in
kind
personal
relations
except
of
this
nature
should
not
be
sought
by
the
employee
particularly
if
she
is
a
woman
outside
of
the
office
or
shop
she
may
meet
and
treat
her
employer
as
a
fellow
citizen
and
member
of
society
under
the
common
rights
of
citizenship
and
the
proper
social
rules
but
in
business
hours
she
should
obey
the
strict
ethics
of
business
thus
she
may
don
what
dress
she
will
when
her
work
is
done
adopt
all
the
eccentricities
of
fashion
she
pleases
but
she
should
wear
with
cheerfulness
and
even
pride
the
simple
dress
prescribed
for
good
and
sufficient
reasons
as
her
working
costume
even
when
no
such
regulations
are
made
her
good
sense
and
taste
should
lead
her
to
adopt
a
modest
practical
working
dress
simple
mode
of
arranging
the
hair
etc
this
is
always
agreeable
to
customers
and
it
is
by
pleasing
these
she
best
pleases
her
employer
stenographers
and
secretaries
have
a
special
obligation
to
keep
sacred
the
confidences
of
their
employers
if
they
find
that
in
so
doing
they
are
made
instruments
in
perpetrating
frauds
on
other
business
men
or
the
community
in
general
they
have
no
right
to
expose
these
their
only
proper
course
is
to
resign
their
positions
holding
sacred
however
the
knowledge
gained
while
acting
as
employees
it
is
only
when
formally
relieved
of
this
obligation
by
legal
compulsion
to
testify
in
court
that
they
may
reveal
this
knowledge
while
it
is
the
custom
of
an
employer
to
demand
references
of
the
employee
and
not
give
them
for
himself
the
only
safe
course
for
a
woman
seeking
employment
is
to
look
into
the
character
of
the
man
for
whom
she
is
to
work
and
the
nature
of
his
business
this
she
may
do
indirectly
in
the
case
of
character
and
directly
in
the
case
of
nature
of
business
if
the
employer
refuses
to
impart
this
saying
your
work
will
be
to
do
whatever
i
ask
you
it
is
a
blind
and
therefore
dangerous
contract
into
which
you
are
entering
and
you
should
withdraw
from
it
in
time
when
an
employee
has
proved
her
efficiency
and
has
seen
that
it
is
producing
an
amount
of
returns
to
the
business
of
which
she
is
not
receiving
her
proportionate
share
it
is
her
right
and
duty
to
ask
for
an
increase
in
wages
if
she
fails
to
receive
this
she
should
investigate
the
conditions
in
the
labor
market
of
her
class
and
guide
her
action
accordingly
if
she
finds
that
there
is
a
demand
for
workers
of
her
ability
at
the
higher
wage
she
should
again
proffer
her
request
to
her
employer
with
a
statement
of
this
fact
if
he
still
refuses
the
increase
she
should
resign
her
position
upon
proper
notice
and
seek
employment
elsewhere
when
the
unmarried
woman
employs
herself
in
free
service
for
the
public
good
there
will
be
no
need
for
her
to
contend
for
the
proper
returns
which
will
be
the
love
and
respect
of
the
community
given
her
in
full
measure
in
comparison
with
these
rewards
the
honors
of
club
president
and
society
leader
for
which
many
women
contend
with
a
rivalry
that
surpasses
in
bitterness
contests
for
political
honors
among
men
are
mean
and
empty
the
words
of
the
master
to
his
disciples
that
he
who
would
be
first
among
them
should
be
servant
to
his
fellows
should
be
taken
to
heart
by
american
women
before
whom
are
opening
new
and
vast
opportunities
for
the
display
of
pride
and
ambition
no

than
for
modest
faithful
service

marriage
is
the
crown
of
woman
life
a
dignity
that
is
all
the
more
honorable
because
it
is
of
general
expectation
and
realization
there
is
a
presumption
that
the
unmarried
woman
has
missed
the
central
and
significant
reason
for
her
existence
the
perpetuation
and
nurture
of
the
race
and
that
the
burden
is
upon
her
for
compensating
society
by

for
this
lost
opportunity
marriage
for
a
woman
means
attainment
first
and
fulfilment
after
the
reward
given
in
advance
of
labor
and
therefore
entailing
a
special
moral
obligation
that
it
be
justified
in
its
fruits
nature
gives
the
future
mother
peace
of
mind
rest
from
doubt
as
to
career
and
from
responsibility
as
to
breadwinning
in
order
that
she
may
tranquilly
devote
herself
to
her
special
function
as
the
maker
of
the
home
the
fact
that
in
the
normal
home
the
wife
is
relieved
from
the
necessity
of
earning
the
living
of
the
home
sometimes
has
the
effect
of
making
her
careless
about
expenditure
the
thoughtless
wife
and
here
thoughtless
means
selfish
assumes
that
the
problem
of
providing
is
up
to
the
husband
and
takes
no
care
to
aid
him
in
its
solution
if
the
suggestion
of
her
being
a
burden
to
him
ever
does
cross
her
mind
she
is
ready
to
excuse
herself
by
consolatory
sayings
such
as
two
can
live
cheaper
than
one
the
truth
of
which
though
universal
when
every
wife
was
a
producer
of
such
things
as
clothing
that
are
now
bought
is
now
the
case
only
in
agricultural
homes
and
even
there
has
lost
a
great
deal
of
its
force
men
do
not
marry
now
as
they
once
did
for
economic
reasons
but
rather
in
spite
of
them
for
the
higher
rewards
of
love
and
companionship
of
wife
and
children
and
this
the
wife
should
recognize
by
giving
her
husband
the
things
for
which
he
has
made
his
economic
sacrifice
in
the
old
days
a
man
who
did
not
marry
paid
for
his
liberty
by
loss
of
physical
comfort
and
wealth
thus
hesiod
one
of
the
earliest
greek
poets
in
his
farmer
almanac
called
works
and
days
coupled
the
marrying
of
a
wife
with
the
purchase
of
a
yoke
of
oxen
and
a
plow
as
the
first
things
needful
in
beginning
to
farm
and
this
in
despite
of
the
fact
that
he
was
a
now
it
is
the
woman
who
is
tempted
to
marry
for
economic
reasons
to
be
certain
of
material
support
while
she
exercises
herself
in
those
household
avocations
and
social
pleasures
which
constitute
the
main
activities
of
women
this
is
a
legitimate
consideration
only
when
the
interest
of
the
man
is
also
taken
into
account
marriage
to
a
man
whom
she
does
not
love
is
a
crime
for
any
woman
giving
falsely
the
offerings
of
love
for
material
things
is
harlotry
even
though
legitimated
by
vows
and
ceremonies
on
the
other
hand
marriage
for
love
to
a
man
who
can
not
support
her
is
a
sad
mistake
for
a
woman
who
is
not
able
or
willing
to
take
the
place
of
breadwinner
for
such
a
union
defeats
its
own
purpose
therefore
in
kindness
to
the
man
as
well
as
to
herself
such
a
woman
should
satisfy
herself
that
he
can
support
her
not
necessarily
in
the
style
to
which
she
has
been
accustomed
but
in
the
style
necessary
for
her
to
perform
the
duties
of
homemaker
and
mother
those
marriages
are
the
happiest
where
a
wife
can
also
enter
into
sympathy
with
her
husband

ambitions
in
particular
and
ideals
of
life
in
general
here
she
is
peculiarly
his

he
can

but
not

a
girl
properly
reared
will
naturally
be
drawn
to
a
man
complementary
to
her
in
character
not
opposite
as
is
so
often
said
opposition
implies
antagonism
which
would
be
the
ruin
of
home
life
the
term
complementary
implies
similarity
in
the
main
elements
of
character
with
adaptable
differences
good
qualities
such
as
strength
and

may
complement

but
not
evil
and

qualities
such
as

and
tenderness
as
scott
says
in
the
quotation
at
the
head
of
this
chapter
a
tender
wife
may
suit
the
taste
of
a
churlish
husband
but
only
by
not
long
surviving
his
unkindness
while
such
opposition
may
not
result
in
actual
death
it
certainly
leads
to
the
demise
of
all
that
makes
life
worth
living
a
woman
should
not
expect
to
find
a
perfect
husband
indeed
her
chief
usefulness
to
him
will
be
in
her
strengthening
his
weak
points
and
cultivating
his
right
inclinations
until
they
are
confirmed
habits
yet
in
this
work
she
should
realize
the
imperfections
in
herself
and
respond
to
the
similar
aid
he
gives
her
by
his
example
and
suggestions
mutual
aid
is
the
great
bond
of
marriage
as
it
is
of
all
human
relations
women
from
their
weaker
condition
have
from
ages
past
been
trained
to
gain
their
desires
from
men
by
indirection
in
the
worst
form
this
appears
as
deceit
in
the
best
as
tact
laying
aside
the
moral
aspect
deceit
is
always
unwise
in
a
wife
since
in
time
it
defeats
its
own
end
many
a
woman
thinks
that
she
is
deceiving
her
husband
since
she
wins
her
points
when
he
thoroughly
recognizes
her
machinations
and
accedes
to
them
without
contest
simply
for
peace
in
the
household
acquiring
a
feeling
of
moral
superiority
to
her
which
though
it
may
be
tolerant
is
nevertheless
contemptuous
but
when
she
employs
loving
tact
especially
in
the
improvement
of
her
husband
habits
and
traits
even
though
he
realizes
it
he
is
at
heart
grateful
for
it
and
proud
of
his
wife
superiority
in
these
points
in
those
matters
where
the
characters
of
husband
and
wife
are
strong
enough
to
permit
frankness
this
should
always
be
employed
in
all
the
grave
problems
of
life
there
should
be
perfect
confidence
between
the
pair
who
have
taken
the
solemn
vows
of
wedlock
any
third
party
that
enjoys
a
superior
confidence
with
one
of
them
whether
relative
or
friend
even
the
pastor
or
family
physician
is
the
man
invoked
against
in
the
marriage
charge
who
puts
them
asunder
where
unhappily
the
husband
is
irreligious
and
the
wife
is
forced
to
seek
confidential
help
and
consolation
of
her
spiritual
adviser
she
should
strictly
limit
these
to

else

and
sanitary
viewpoints
is
essential
good
neighbors
are
almost
as
necessary
as
good
air
and
good
drainage
even
before
the
children
have
come
it
is
a
limitation
on
the
function
of
a
home
for
husband
and
wife
to
be
forced
to
seek
social
life
entirely
outside
the
neighborhood
if
charity
that
is
loving
helpful
associations
begins
at
home
it
certainly
does
not
stop
at
the
threshold
or
leap
therefrom
over
those
nearest
us
the
best
citizens
are
those
who
take
a
human
interest
in
the
people
of
their
street
or
ward
or
village
for
influence
in
civic
reform
is
dependent
on
neighborliness
children
are
good
citizens
in
this
respect
by
nature
limited
to
association
with
children
of
the
neighborhood
they
form
an
affection
for
their
playmates
which
may
lead
to
good
or
evil
results
as
these
playmates
are
moral
or
vicious
in
their
tendencies
therefore
at
the
formative
period
of
character
children
should
be
guarded
from
the
debasing
influences
of
improper
companions
as
well
as
such
institutions
as
saloons
and
low
which
are
generally
found
to
be
the
local
causes
of
bad
neighbors
of
course
a
neighborhood
should
be
selected
where
there
are
good
public
schools
churches
and
allied
institutions
for
education
and
culture
it
is
always
a
loss
to
a
child
in
this
democratic
country
to
be
educated
in
a
private
school
and
yet
especially
in
cities
careful
parents
are
often
compelled
to
resort
to
private
instruction
for
their
girls
and
boys
because
of
the
lack
of
refining
influences
in
the
public
schools
this
is
why
it
is
often
better
for
families
when
the
father
works
in
the
city
to
live
in
the
suburbs
where
as
a
rule
the
best
public
schools
are
to
be
found
but
it
may
not
be
feasible
to
live
out
of
the
city
especially
in
the
first
years
of
married
life
and
therefore
the
home
life
must
begin
in
an
apartment
the
same
sanitary
considerations
that
obtain
in
choice
of
a
neighborhood
are
essential
in
the
choice
of
a
flat
good
air
light
space
proper
plumbing
and
general
cleanness
are
to
be
sought
owing
to
the
general
demand
for
these
advantages
and
a
limited
supply
of
them
which
is
due
to
economic
conditions
prevailing
in
our
cities
they
unfortunately
require
money
therefore
the
is
compelled
to
do
the
best
he
can
with
that
part
of
his
income
which
he
may
safely
appropriate
for
rent
as
a
rule
this
amount
is
not
more
than
of
income
when
an
apartment
house
has
been
properly
built
and
the
walls
are
settled
and
the
plastering
dry
it
generally
comes
up
to
the
standard
of
comfort
and
health
here
the
latest
improvements
in
plumbing
will
be
apt
to
be
found
and
there
will
be
no
danger
of
vermin
then
too
a
concession
is
more
apt
to
be
made
by
the
landlord
who
is
anxious
to
secure
tenants
by
remission
of
a
month
or
a
fortnight
rent
to
be
taken
out
after
the
first
month
the
landlord
of
such
a
house
is
also
readier
than
the
owner
of
an
old
one
to
make
decorations
and
even
alterations
to
suit
the
taste
of
the
tenant
the
walls
in
the
kitchen
should
be
painted
rather
than
papered
and
other
parts
of
the
flat
designed
primarily
for
utility
since
light
is
the
great
desideratum
the
paint
as
a
rule
should
be
light
in
color
though
soft
and
tinted
in
tone
for
restfulness
to
the
eye
where
wallpaper
is
used
it
should
have
the
same
characteristics
fanciful
designs
should
be
avoided
indeed
plain
paper
forms
the
best
base
for
artistic
color
schemes
in
the
decoration
of
rooms
the
variety
in
which
is
best
obtained
by
the
choice
of
furniture
and
pictures
and
other
wall
ornaments
when
there
is
a
prospect
that
living
in
apartments
will
be
only
a
temporary
arrangement
the
furniture
should
be
chosen
with
a
view
to
its
adaptability
for
a
house
thus
should
be
avoided
and
other
articles
that
gain
space
by
complexity
however
ingenious
simplicity
is
the
quality
to
be
desired
thus
if
the
exigency
of
space
requires
that
a
living
room
by
day
be
converted
into
a
sleeping
room
a
couch
should
be
bought
for
it
instead
of
a
folding
bed
it
will
then
serve
the
purpose
of
a
sofa
as
well
as
a
bed
if
it
is
a
box
couch
further
economy
will
be
gained
by
its
use
as
a
place
to
store
the
bedclothes
but
the
simplest
of
all
arrangements
is
a
divan
bed
formed
of
springs
and
mattress
alone
and
supported
on
legs
nailed
to
the
corners
of
the
over
it
a
cover
should
be
thrown
during
the
day
and
the
pillows
in
use
if
there
is
not
room
for
them
elsewhere
should
be
slipped
into
covers
harmonious
in
color
with
the
couch
drapery
such
a
reclining
and
sleeping
couch
may
also
be
used
in
bedrooms
although
an
iron
or
brass
bedstead
gives
an
appearance
of
neatness
and
personal
privacy
that
is
desirable
in
such
chambers
where
there
is
lack
of
closet
space
and
lockers
trunks
can
be
utilized
in
a
flat
for
storing
things
steamer
trunks
that
can
be
placed
beneath
the
beds
and
couches
are
therefore
the
best
kind
to
buy
they
can
also
be
readily
converted
into
window
seats
by
making
pads
of
cotton
batting
to
fit
the
tops
and
placing
over
them
covers
and
pillow
cushions
harmonious
with
the
decoration
of
the
room
long
flat
wardrobe
trunks
are
sold
which
contain
at
one
end
rods
for
hanging
clothes
so
that
when
stood
up
on
the
other
end
against
the
wall
they
serve
as
wardrobes
they
always
look
however
like
makeshifts
and
so
are
more
useful
in
travelling
than
in
the
home
rugs
are
more
desirable
than
carpets
in
a
city
apartment
since
they
can
be
more
readily
cleaned
and
in
case
of
moving
to
another
flat
or
a
house
in
the
suburbs
will
be
more
adaptable
to
the
new
situation
bookcases
in
a
temporary
home
should
be
of
the
unit
system
where
each
shelf
is
a
separate
box
enabling
the
books
to
be
moved
without
repacking
and
permitting
rearrangement
to
suit
the
new
situation
or
the
acquisition
of
new
books
where
however
the
lower
part
of
wall
space
is
desired
to
give
room
for
articles
of
furniture
such
as
couches
shelves
can
be
built
beginning
at
four
and
or
five
feet
above
the
floor
edwin
markham
the
poet
whose
home
overflows
with
books
has
greatly
economized
space
by
building
for
them
a
broad
lower
shelf
about
eighteen
inches
wide
and
three
inches
above
this
another
shelf
twelve
inches
wide
and
three
inches
above
this
a
third
six
inches
wide
when
these
are
filled
with
books
the
titles
of
all
are
exposed
and
by
taking
out
the
volume
or
two
immediately
in
front
a
volume
on
one
of
the
back
shelves
is
readily
obtained
thus
by
walking
about
his
room
markham
can
look
with
level
eyes
for
the
book
he
wants
and
procure
it
without
recourse
to
a
chair
or
stepladder
this
plan
of
banking
books
also
lends
itself
to
a
decorative
arrangement
of
them
except
in
matters
such
as
these
where
economy
is
imperative
the
furnishing
of
a
city
apartment
does
not
differ
essentially
from
that
of
a
house
and
the
reader
is
therefore
referred
to
the
discussion
of
this
in
the
following
pages
the
suburban
village
or
country
home
differs
from
the
city
apartment
or
even
city
house
in
that
it
has
been
built
without
the
primary
consideration
of
space
it
is
separated
from
other
houses
even
though
by
the
narrowest
space
of
green
lawn
that
gives
a
house
the
individuality
and
independence
without
which
it
is
hard
for
it
to
gather
the
associations
of
home
even
when
a
detached
house
is
found
in
a
city
its
architecture
is
generally
hampered
by
its
adaptation
to
its
narrow
grounds
it
rarely
has
that
rounded
development
of
character
which
is
as
desirable
in
a
home
as
in
a
person
in
selecting
a
rented
home
in
the
suburbs
the
cost
of
the
transportation
to
and
from
the
city
should
be
added
to
the
rent
to
keep
this
within
the
proper
ratio
to
income
just
as
the
difference
in
price
of
provisions
should
be
considered
in
that
portion
allotted
to
food
provisions
even
country
produce
are
often
dearer
in
suburban
communities
than
in
the
city
and
less
saving
can
be
made
by
close
marketing
because
the
farmers
and
gardeners
find
it
more
profitable
to
send
their
produce
to
the
center
of
greatest
demand
and
therefore
of
readiest
sale
even
though
it
costs
more
for
transportation
than
to
the
smaller
markets
near
by
so
suburban
grocers
and
provision
men
are
wont
to
buy
in
the
city
markets
and
add
the
cost
of
transportation
back
from
the
city
and
an
additional
profit
for
the
transaction
to
the
price
to
the
consumer
owing
to
the
close
competition
for
householders
among
men
it
is
now
almost
as
easy
to
purchase
a
suburban
home
as
it
is
to
rent
one
and
it
is
therefore
advisable
to
do
this
the
interest
on
purchase
and
the
fixed
charges
of
taxes
insurance
water
rent
should
be
counted
as
rent
but
a
higher
percentage
of
income
may
be
safely
allotted
to
these
than
to
rent
proper
since
the
purchase
is
also
an
investment
as
a
rule
the
increase
of
land
value
near
a
growing
city
will
considerably
exceed
the
diminution
in
the
value
of
the
improvements
indeed
owing
to
the
constant
advance
of
cost
of
building
material
in
recent
years
there
is
often
enhancement
rather
than
depreciation
in
the
house
value
for
these
economic
reasons
it
is
advisable
to
buy
an
old
house
when
its
cost
is
less
than
the
cost
of
constructing
a
new
one
of
the
same
desirability
the
however
should
curb
his
propensity
to
make
extensive
alterations
for
one
leading
to
another
he
will
find
at
the
end
if
he
ever
reaches
it
that
he
has
virtually
built
a
new
house
at
a
cost
greater
than
he
could
afford
on
the
other
hand
he
should
avoid
those
houses
built
on
speculation
to
sell
in
these
a
showy
appearance
is
gained
at
the
expense
of
durability
of
construction
and
the
purchaser
will
find
that
he
must
pay
in
plumbing
coal
bills
and
general
repairs
an
amount
he
had
not
calculated
upon
as
interest
on
the
home
for
unless
he
rebuilds
the
house
at
ruinous
expense
these
will
be
annual
charges
the
most
satisfactory
way
and
the
one
leading
to
great
enjoyment
in
satisfying
the
instinct
which
possesses
newly
mated
people
no
less
than
birds
is
for
the
owners
themselves
to
plan
and
superintend
the
building
of
the
home
there
is
an
infinite
variety
of
architectural
plans
spread
before
the
homeseeker
in
books
and
magazines
an
examination
of
these
will
be
of
great
value
to
him
in
clarifying
his
hazy
ideas
but
he
should
not
settle
upon
any
one
of
them
without
expert
opinion
he
should
employ
a
local
architect
or
at
least
a
builder
with
practical
architectural
ideas
to
examine
every
feature
of
the
plan
selected
as
nearest
the
homeseeker
ideal
and
revise
it
according
to
local
conditions
cost
and

money
is
always

she

however

therefore
it

for

to

herself
as

the
main
principles

the

out
of
place
in
a
room
frequented
by
children
for
convenience
the
should
be
kept
in
drawers
or
lockers
built
beneath
the
shelves
containing
the
china
a
butler
pantry
is
not
an
essential
when
such
arrangements
as
these
are
made
the
kitchen
pantry
storeroom
and
laundry
form
as
it
were
the
factory
of
the
house
with
the
range
as
the
central
engine
accordingly
they
should
be
planned
with
respect
to
each
other
to
save
steps
fortunately
this
means
also
saving
expense
in
construction
architects
have
been
most
ingenious
as
well
as
practical
in
perfecting
these
arrangements
and
the
housebuilder
therefore
needs
no
advice
from
us
it
can
not
be
too
much
emphasized
however
that
the
cellar
is
from
the
standpoints
of
sanitation
and
comfort
the
most
important
part
of
the
house
there
should
be
no
attempt
to
save
expense
by
limiting
its
proper
size
materials
for
walls
windows
for
ventilation
drainage
for
money
so
saved
will
inevitably
be
paid
out
many
times
over
in
coal
bills
doctor
fees
and
perhaps
undertaker
bills
a
dry
cellar
must
be
secured
at
all
costs
for
the
air
from
it
permeates
the
whole
house
where
this
is
damp
it
leads
not
alone
to
disease
among
the
inmates
but
to
the
disintegration
of
the
house
itself
through
what
is
called
dry
rot
but
is
paradoxically
the
result
of
dampness
edgar
allan
poe
in
his
weird
story
the
fall
of
the
house
of
usher
has
given
a
mystical
interpretation
of
the
dissolution
of
an
old
homestead
which
really
has
a
scientific
explanation
that
might
be
found
in
the
cellar
the
proper
floor
of
a
cellar
is
a
layer
of
broken
stones
in
which
tile
drains
are
laid
having
outlets
into
a
common
drain
and
over
which
a
layer
of
concrete
is
placed
the
walls
of
plastered
stone
brick
or
concrete
should
rise
above
the
ground
far
enough
to
permit
small
windows
and
prevent
the
admission
of
surface
water
from
rain
or
snow
these
windows
should
open
from
within
upward
and
there
should
be
hooks
on
the
ceiling
to
keep
them
open
for
ventilation
where
a
house
is
heated
by
a
furnace
the
style
of
this
should
be
selected
with
great
care
special
regard
being
had
to
the
economy
of
fuel
the
systems
of
heating
or
heating
have
each
their
merits
depending
on
the
location
of
the
house
and
the
climate
of
the
region
the
cellar
can
also
be
used
as
a
storeroom
for
those
things
not
affected
by
the
heat
of
the
furnace
such
as
perishable
food
requiring
an
or
a
cool
place
vegetables
especially
those
with
a
penetrating
odor
apples
canned
fruit
and
goods
should
be
kept
here
and
barrels
of
commodities
such
as
vinegar
that
are
bought
in
large
quantities
shelves
should
be
built
on
the
walls
and
hooks
hung
on
the
rafters
to
increase
the
facilities
for
storage
articles
hung
upon
the
hooks
should
be
tied
in
paper
bags
it
is
well
to
have
the
cellar
ceiled
to
keep
out
the
dust
of
the
house
and
reduce
the
risk
of
fire
here
of
course
is
the
natural
place
for
the
and
when
there
are
no
the
man
workshop
the
laundry
may
also
be
placed
in
the
cellar
and
in
stormy
weather
the
clothes
hung
there
to
dry
in
the
country
the
cellar
is
a
good
place
in
which
to
build
an
the
kitchen
should
of
course
be
airy
and
sunny
the
sink
should
be
placed
near
a
south
window
if
possible
to
prevent
freezing
of
pipes
an
iron
sink
is
more
cleanly
than
a
wooden
one
and
cheaper
than
porcelain
and
copper
it
should
have
a
platform
with
room
for
two
dishpans
and
a
drying
shelf
raised
at
one
end
to
permit
drainage
where
economy
of
space
is
essential
this
shelf
may
be
removable
permitting
the
use
for
other
things
of
the
table
beneath
two
other
tables
are
necessary
in
a
proper
kitchen
equipment
one
covered
with
zinc
for
a
set
near
the
range
and
the
other
a
plain
table
set
near
the
for
the
prepared
dishes
there
should
be
three
lights
lamps
in
brackets
or
electric
bulbs
near
the
sink
range
and
respectively
the
refrigerator
should
be
put
outside
the
kitchen
in
some
such
place
as
a
sheltered
part
of
the
back
piazza
commodities
such
as
tea
and
coffee
not
requiring
ice
should
be
kept
in
covered
jars
preferably
earthen
on
a
dresser
or
shelf
where
the
may
also
stand
there
should
be
a
kitchen
closet
for
the
and
which
should
be
covered
for
further
protection
from
dust
flies
dampness
and
for
the
canned
goods
in
immediate
requisition
the
stove
or
range
should
be
selected
with
reference
on
the
one
hand
to
the
amount
of
cooking
to
be
done
for
the
family
and
on
the
other
to
the
saving
of
fuel
where
there
is
a
water
supply
of
course
there
should
be
a
boiler
connected
with
the
range
this
should
be
large
enough
to
assure
a
sufficient
supply
of
hot
water
for
the
house
there
should
be
a
shelf
near
the
range
for
such
articles
as
the
and
which
are
in
constant
use
in
cooking
and
hooks
should
be
near
at
hand
for
hanging
up
the
poker
and
a
coarse
towel
for
use
in
taking
pans
from
the
oven
other
shelves
and
hooks
of
course
should
be
put
in
for
the
various
utensils
necessary
in
the
kitchen
the
floor
of
the
kitchen
should
be
covered
with
a
good
quality
of
linoleum
a
perforated
rubber
mat
may
be
placed
at
the
sink
although
this
is
not
necessary
in
fact
it
is
a
better
plan
for
the
woman
in
the
kitchen
as
indeed
elsewhere
to
get
rubber
heels
for
her
shoes
the
arabs
have
a
proverb
that
to
him
who
is
shod
it
is
as
if
the
whole
world
were
covered
with
leather
and
rubber
heels
similarly
cause
every
floor
in
the
house
whether
bare
or
carpeted
to
be
equally
easy
to
the
feet
of
the
busy
housewife
the
laundry
should
be
supplied
with
two
tubs
an
an
and
a
stove
for
the
boiler
and
the
irons
the
should
be
supported
upon
two
horses
of
the
height
of
the
table
the
table
should
be
supplied
with
an
in
a
house
there
should
be
separate
bedrooms
for
every
inmate
except
the
very
small
children
it
is
quite
an
economy
in
the
care
of
the
house
that
each
child
at
as
early
an
age
as
possible
should
have
its
own
room
and
be
taught
to
take
care
of
it
since
the
room
is
designed
primarily
for
sleeping
care
should
be
taken
that
the
bed
be
placed
in
such
a
position
that
the
light
falls
from
behind
the
sleeper
head
the
dresser
should
be
so
placed
that
the
light
falls
on
the
face
of
the
occupant
of
the
room
when
he
is
looking
into
the
mirror
even
at
the
expense
of
space
in
the
bedroom
proper
there
should
be
a
large
closet
in
every
the
deeper
the
closet
the
better
for
by
using
rods
attached
to
the
back
of
the
closet
and
projecting
through
its
width
whereon
may
be
strung
far
more
room
will
be
obtained
for
clothes
than
where
hooks
and
nails
are
employed
by
the
use
of
these
too
suits
and
dresses
may
be
kept
in
much
better
order
the
top
of
the
closet
may
be
occupied
by
one
broad
high
shelf
whereon
hats
and
bonnets
may
be
kept
in
their
proper
receptacles
shoes
should
be
kept
in
a
drawer
at
the
bottom
of
the
closet
rather
than
thrown
on
the
floor
beneath
the
dresser
it
is
a
mistake
to
substitute
a
curtain
for
the
door
of
the
closet
since
it
is
of
the
first
importance
to
keep
the
clothing
free
from
dust
shelves
are
better
than
closets
for
the
keeping
of
the
bed
linen
it
is
a
handy
thing
to
have
a
separate
linen
closet
in
the
house
but
this
is
not
essential
the
of
the
mother
is
a
suitable
place
for
keeping
the
linen
shelves
are
preferable
to
closets
for
this
purpose
there
should
also
be
a
medicine
closet
or
locker
in
the
mother
room
which
will
be
handy
in
case
of
sudden
illness
among
the
children
in
view
of
the
importance
of
sanitation
more
thought
than
is
ordinarily
allotted
to
it
should
be
given
to
the
lavatory
where
there
is
room
to
spare
it
is
best
to
have
the
bath
separate
from
the
toilet
in
order
to
prevent
inconvenience
in
use
there
should
be
a
basin
and
toilet
upon
the
ground
floor
and
a
bathroom
and
toilet
upon
the
sleeping
floor
the
walls
of
the
lavatory
should
be
tiled
or
if
this
is
too
expensive
they
should
be
covered
with
paper
all
toilet
arrangements
should
be
systematically
kept
clean
and
the
necessary
supplies
at
all
times
provided
piazzas
may
be
made
to
add
no
less
to
the
utility
than
to
the
beauty
and
comfort
of
the
house
a
lower
back
piazza
covered
with
vines
is
the
ideal
place
in
summer
for
eating
and
such
heating
labors
as
ironing
when
thoroughly
secured
from
intrusion
an
upper
balcony
furnishes
the
best
of
sleeping
quarters
for
one
wise
and
brave
enough
to
scout
the
superstition
of
the
bad
effects
of
night
air
many
persons
of
delicate
health
even
consumptives
have
been
restored
to
vigorous
strength
by
sleeping
in
such
a
place
not
only
in
summer
but
throughout
the
winter
save
in
beating
storms
closely
conjoined
with
forethought
for
utility
in
the
planning
of
a
house
is
forethought
for
beauty
it
is
well
to
have
an
artistic
imagination
in
visualizing
as
it
were
the
hominess
of
the
house
as
it
will
appear
after
its
rawness
has
been
mellowed
by
time
and
its
forms
have
been
endeared
by
association
this
imagination
is
specially
essential
in
the
planting
of
trees
arrangement
of
flower
gardens
the
choice
of
the
kind
of
enclosure
whether
hedge
or
fence
and
in
general
all
that
is
known
under
the
name
of
landscape
gardening
the
housekeeper
work
is
greatly
dependent
upon
the
kind
of
water
supply
available
for
the
house
in
cities
and
towns
the
kind
of
supply
is
fixed
for
her
but
in
the
country
she
is
afforded
her
freedom
of
choice
she
has
a
choice
of
water
from
wells
or
springs
which
is
more
or
less
hard
that
is
impregnated
with
lime
and
water
collected
from
rain
or
melting
snow
for
household
purposes
rainwater
is
the
more
desirable
and
when
properly
filtered
and
kept
in
clean
cisterns
protected
from
the
larvae
of
mosquitoes
and
other
insects
it
is
also
the
best
for
drinking
purposes
to
one
accustomed
to
drinking
hard
water
from
a
well
or
spring
rain
water
is
a
little
unpalatable
but
after
he
is
accustomed
to
its
use
he
will
prefer
it
it
is
always
wise
to
secure
an
analysis
of
the
drinking
water
of
the
house
since
water
reputed
pure
because
of
its
clearness
and
coldness
is
as
apt
as
any
other
to
be
contaminated
where
soft
water
is
not
available
for
household
use
hard
water
may
be
softened
by
the
addition
to
it
of
pearline
or
soda
or
by
boiling
in
the
latter
case
the
lime
in
it
being
precipitated
to
the
bottom
of
the
kettle
or
boiler
when
well
water
is
used
for
drinking
some
knowledge
of
the
geology
of
the
home
grounds
is
essential
thus
because
the
top
of
a
well
is
on
higher
ground
than
the
is
no
reason
for
assuming
that
the
contents
of
the
latter
may
not
seep
into
the
water
for
the
inclination
of
the
strata
of
the
rocks
may
be
in
a
contrary
direction
to
that
of
the
surface
of
the
ground
when
filters
and
strainers
are
used
they
should
be
carefully
cleaned
at
regular
intervals
since
if
they
are
permitted
to
accumulate
impurities
they
become
a
source
of
contamination
instead
of
its
remedy
every
once
in
a
while
the
housekeeper
should
take
off
the
strainers
from
the
faucets
and
boil
them
there
are
many
excellent
systems
for
obtaining
water
power
for
the
house
in
the
country
each
of
which
has
its
special
advantages
the
pumping
of
water
to
a
tank
at
the
top
of
the
house
by
a
windmill
is
that
most
commonly
used
this
is
the
cheapest
method
but
the
most
unsightly
small
kerosene
or
engines
may
be
employed
for
the
power
at
very
slight
cost
and
will
prove
useful
for
other
purposes
such
as
sawing
wood
or
even
operating
the
owing
to
the
many
inventions
for
isolated
lighting
plants
by
acetylene
and
other
kinds
of
gas
dwellers
in
the
country
have
virtually
as
free
a
choice
of
illumination
as
the
people
in
towns
and
cities
great
caution
is
necessary
in
the
use
of
any
form
of
illuminating
gas
since
all
produce
asphyxiation
accordingly
all
gas
fixtures
of
the
house
should
be
regularly
inspected
to
see
that
there
is
no
escape
of
the
subtile
destructive
fluid
the
odor
of
escaping
gas
which
is
so
unpleasant
is
really
a
blessing
in
that
it
informs
the
householder
of
his
danger
a
cock
that
turns
completely
around
and
after
extinguishing
the
light
permits
the
escape
of
the
gas
is
more
dangerous
than
a
poisonous
serpent
yet
there
may
be
nothing
radically
wrong
with
this
fixture
and
the
use
of
the
screwdriver
may
make
it
as
good
as
new
gas
should
never
be
turned
low
when
there
is
a
draught
in
the
room
nor
allowed
to
burn
near
hanging
draperies
care
should
always
be
taken
in
turning
out
a
or
a
to
do
so
at
the
fixture
and
not
at
the
burner
this
is
not
alone
safer
but
it
keeps
the
rubber
tube
from
acquiring
a
disagreeable
odor
from
the
gas
that
has
been
left
in
it
great
economy
in
the
consumption
of
gas
may
be
secured
by
the
use
of
welsbach
and
other
incandescent
burners
where
these
are
not
employed
care
should
be
taken
to
select
the
most
economical
kind
of
gas
tips
and
to
see
that
when
these
become
impaired
by
use
they
are
replaced
in
the
large
cities
there
is
constant
complaint
of
defective
so
much
so
that
inspectors
have
been
appointed
to
correct
this
abuse
it
has
been
found
however
that
many
complaints
have
been
unfounded
because
the
housewives
were
not
able
properly
to
read
the
meter
directions
how
to
do
this
will
therefore
be
found
useful
a
has
three
dials
marking
tip
to
feet
feet
and
feet
respectively
the
figures
on
the
second
dial
are
arranged
in
opposite
order
from
those
on
the
first
and
third
dials
and
this
often
leads
to
an
error
in
reckoning
however
there
should
be
no
trouble
in
setting
down
the
figures
indicated
by
the
pointer
on
each
dial
we
first
set
down
the
figure
indicated
upon
the
first
dial
in
the
units
place
of
a
period
of
three
places
then
that
indicated
upon
the
second
dial
in
the
tens
place
and
then
that
indicated
upon
the
third
dial
in
the
hundreds
place
to
these
we
add
two
ciphers
to
obtain
the
number
of
feet
of
gas
that
has
been
burned
since
the
meter
was
set
at
zero
on
the
three
dials
from
this
number
we
subtract
the
total
of
feet
burned
at
the
time
when
the
preceding
gas
bill
was
rendered
this
is
generally
called
on
the
bill
present
state
of
meter
the
result
of
the
subtraction
will
be
the
amount
of
gas
that
has
been
burned
since
the
last
bill
was
rendered
for
example
amount
indicated
on
dial
amount
marked
present
state
of

on

gas
bill
amount
of
gas
for
which
current
bill
is
rendered
equal
care
must
be
exercised
when
kerosene
is
used
for
illumination
since
while
it
is
not
so
dangerous
directly
to
life
it
is
the
chief
source
of
the
destruction
of
property
accordingly
the
nature
of
kerosene
and
the
way
it
illuminates
is
a
profitable
subject
of
study
if
we
would
prevent
destructive
fires
really
we
do
not
burn
the
oil
but
the
gas
that
arises
from
the
oil
when
liberated
by
the
burning
wick
and
becomes
incandescent
when
fed
by
the
oxygen
of
the
air
while
kerosene
requires
a
high
temperature
for
combustion
it
is
closely
related
to
other
products
of
coal
oil
such
as
naphtha
and
gasoline
which
become
inflammable
at
a
low
heat
and
are
therefore
very
dangerous
since
the
cheap
grades
of
kerosene
approach
these
products
in
quality
care
should
be
taken
to
see
that
it
is
of
high
proof
in
order
to
prevent
explosions
the
proof
required
of
kerosene
differs
in
various
states
that
in
some
is
as
low
as
degrees
fahrenheit
that
is
the
temperature
at
which
the
oil
will
give
off
vapors
that
will
ignite
this
is
too
low
a
proof
for
such
a
degree
of
temperature
is
quite
common
in
the
household
it
is
safe
only
to
use
that
kerosene
which
is
at
least
degrees
proof
for
then
even
though
the
oil
is
spilled
there
is
little
danger
that
it
will
ignite
except
in
the
immediate
presence
of
flame
there
is
no
danger
at
all
in
soaking
wood
with
this
kind
of
oil
in
a
stove
or
grate
wherein
the
fire
has
gone
out
to
test
kerosene
put
a
thermometer
into
a
cup
partially
filled
with
cold
water
and
add
boiling
water
until
the
mercury
stands
at
degrees
fahrenheit
then
take
out
the
thermometer
and
pour
two
teaspoonfuls
of
kerosene
into
the
cup
and
pass
over
it
the
flame
of
a
candle
if
the
oil
ignites
it
is
unsafe
in
order
to
prevent
the
flame
from
running
down
into
the
lamp
and
causing
an
explosion
the
wick
should
be
soft
filling
the
burner
completely
the
highest
efficiency
in
the
form
of
illumination
is
obtained
by
round
burners
especially
those
in
lamps
which
admit
air
to
the
inside
of
the
wick
and
so
induce
the
largest
possible
amount
of
combustion
such
a
lamp
produces
quite
a
high
degree
of
heat
and
will
answer
the
purpose
of
an
in
a
small
room
contrary
to
the
popular
idea
wicks
should
be
carefully
trimmed
with
scissors
rather
than
with
a
match
or
other
instrument
in
extinguishing
a
lamp
one
should
first
turn
down
the
wick
and
blow
across
the
chimney
never
down
the
chimney
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
wick
is
constantly
bringing
up
oil
by
capillary
attraction
whether
it
is
lighted
or
unlighted
lamps
in
which
the
wicks
have
not
been
cared
are
kept
continually
greasy
in
fact
a
lamp
that
is
greasy
or
that
gives
out
a
bad
odor
is
one
that
has
not
been
properly
cared
with
due
attention
lamps
are
as
clean
and
handy
a
means
of
illumination
as
any
other
form
candles
that
are
now
used
chiefly
for
decorative
purposes
may
still
be
practically
employed
for
carrying
light
about
the
house
the
danger
from
a
falling
candle
carried
by
a
child
up
to
bed
is
not
nearly
so
great
as
that
which
may
result
from
either
spilt
oil
from
a
broken
lamp
or
the
cutting
glass
of
its
chimney
to
those
who
live
in
an
old
house
all
the
foregoing
advice
should
prove
a
source
of
helpfulness
in
making
the
best
of
the
old
home
rather
than
of
dissatisfaction
with
its
seeming
shortcomings
there
are
many
simple
inexpensive
ways
of
making
it
conform
to
the
model
house
expense
need
only
be
incurred
in
sanitary
improvement
such
as
the
better
drainage
of
the
cellar
enabling
it
to
be
utilized
for
purposes
which
now
crowd
the
of
the
home
and
the
alterations
of
the
windows
to
permit
better
lighting
and
ventilation
very
often
a
room
can
be
made
to
exchange
purposes
by
a
simple
transference
of
furniture
thus
saving
the
housekeeper
steps
a
woodhouse
can
be
converted
into
a
summer
kitchen
and
the
old
one
during
this
season
used
as
a
though
it
may
be
found
even
pleasanter
to
eat
out
of
doors
under
an
arbor
or
on
a
wide
piazza
a
porch
may
be
partitioned
off
into
a
laundry
and
the
attic
ceiled
and
partitioned
for
use
as
a
bedroom
very
often
an
old
stairway
built
in
the
days
when
it
was
thought
unseemly
to
show
a
connection
with
the
upper
bedrooms
can
be
relieved
of
its
door
and
walls
to
the
increase
of
space
in
the
lower
room
and
of
the
beauty
of
its
appearance
indeed
as
a
rule
there
are
too
many
doors
in
an
old
house
some
of
these
can
be
altered
into
open
arched
entrances
making
one
large
commodious
room
out
of
two
little
inconvenient
ones
unused
can
be
turned
into
playrooms
for
the
children
and
even
sleeping
quarters
all
these
are
changes
that
make
for
the
beauty
no
less
than
the
utility
of
home
as
proved
by
the
fact
that
many
artists
especially
those
who
have
studied
abroad
where
old
country
houses
are
more
or
less
of
this
unconventional
character
go
into
the
country
and
alter
in
this
fashion
old
and
even
abandoned
houses
into
houses
admired
for
their
charming
individuality
illustrations
of
such
hermitages
frequently
appear
in
the
magazines
and
may
be
studied
for
suggestions
sometimes
the
alteration
is
of
the
exterior
only
the
repainting
in
a
proper
color
or
the
simple
creosote
staining
of
a
house
with
the
addition
of
a
rustic
porch
or
the
breaking
of
a
corner
bedroom
into
a
balcony
will
sometimes
so
transform
an
old
house
that
it
looks

if
it
were

purposes
for
which
furniture
was
designed
and
the
order
of
development
remains
also
the
order
of

the
first
things
to
be
desired
in
any

of

are
durability
and
simple
application
to

naturally
looks
to
see
if
the
use
of
them
will
contribute
to
his
physical
pleasure
as
well
as

that
the

the
mind
decides
the
choice
in
cases
of
equal
utility
and
comfort
the
artistic
considerations
are
so
many
that
furniture
has
become
a
branch
of
art
like
sculpture
or
painting
with
a
large
literature
and
history
of
its
own
since
most
authorities
on
the
subject
largely
ignore
the
questions
of
utility
and
comfort
devoting
themselves
to
the
questions
of
aesthetic
style
it
will
be
useful
to
our
purpose
here
to
confine
the
discussion
to
the
neglected
qualities
as
a
rule
a
durable
useful
and
comfortable
article
is
a
beautiful
one
at
least
it
has
the
beauty
of
grace
by
which
terms
the
old
writers
on
aesthetics
characterized
perfect
adaptation
to
purpose
and
the
beauty
of
what
they
called
homeliness
or
as
we
would
now
say
since
this
term
has
been
perverted
of
hominess
the
suggestion
of
adding
to
the
pleasure
of
the
household
the
quality
of
hominess
is
greatly
increased
in
an
article
of
furniture
by
a
frank
look
or
appearance
there
is
no
more
delightful
occupation
for
the
leisure
hours
of
a
man
or
woman
and
no
more
useful
training
for
a
boy
or
girl
than
the
making
of
simple
articles
of
home
furniture
really
the
first
article
of
furniture
which
should
be
brought
into
the
house
is
a
and
the
first
room
which
should
be
fitted
up
is
the
workshop
a
vast
amount
of
labor
will
be
saved
thereby
in
unpacking
adjusting
repairing
and
polishing
the
old
and
the
new
household
articles
so
that
life
in
the
new
home
be
begun
under
the
favorable
auspices
of
the
great
household
deity
the
goddess
of
order
when
it
is
further
considered
that
often
small
repairs
made
by
a
carpenter
cost
more
than
a
new
article
the
will
be
valued
by
the
family
as
a
most
profitable
investment
if
it
is
not
possible
to
procure
the
proper
materials
and
tools
for
making
the
entire
article
some
part
of
the
work
the
shaping
and
certainly
the
staining
and
polishing
can
be
done
at
home
if
the
visitor
does
not
recognize
the
home
quality
in
such
an
article
the
maker
does
and
will
always
have
a
pride
and
affection
for
it
many
furniture
manufacturers
give
in
their
catalogues
designs
of
or
knock
together
furniture
that
is
the
parts
of
tables
chairs
cut
out
and
planed
which
it
is
intended
that
the
purchaser
put
together
himself
these
as
a
rule
are
made
of
good
material
befitting
the
hand
workmanship
which
will
be
put
upon
them
and
are
offered
at
a
considerable
reduction
from
the
price
asked
for
furniture
of
the
same
material
furniture
stains
of
excellent
quality
are
found
in
every
hardware
store
and
paint
shop
which
can
easily
be
applied
by
the
merest
amateur
it
is
never
wise
to
buy
flimsy
furniture
however
cheap
as
a
rule
there
is
too
much
furniture
in
the
american
home
it
is
better
to
get
along
with
a
few
good
durable
articles
even
though
a
little
expensive
than
with
a
profusion
of
inferior
ones
these
soon
reveal
their
cheap
and
nasty
qualities
are
in
constant
need
of
repair
and
quickly
descend
from
the
place
of
honor
in
the
parlor
to
be
endured
a
while
in
the
living
room
then
abused
in
the
kitchen
and
finally
burnt
as
fuel
good
wood
and
leather
however
are
long
in
becoming
shabby
and
even
then
require
only
a
little
attention
to
be
restored
to
good
condition
when
it
is
considered
that
in
furniture
there
is
virtually
no
monopoly
of
design
or
invention
and
one
therefore
pays
for
material
and
labor
alone
and
competition
has
reduced
these
to
the
lowest
terms
the
purchaser
is
certain
to
get
the
worth
of
his
money
when
he
pays
a
higher
price
for
durable
material
and
honest
workmanship
when
it
is
further
recalled
that
our
chief
heirlooms
from
the
former
generations
are
tables
and
chairs
and
bureaus
it
will
appear
that
it
is
our
duty
to
hand
down
to
our
children
furniture
of
similar
durability
and
honest
quality
therefore
money
spent
for
good
furniture
may
be
considered
as
a
permanent
investment
whose
returns
are
comfort
and
satisfaction
in
the
present
and
loving
remembrance
in
the
days
to
come
so
often
is
the
artistic
beauty
of
a
house
destroyed
by
a
bad
selection
and
arrangement
of
furniture
and
choice
of
inharmonious
decorations
that
many
architects
are
coming
to
advise
and
even
dictate
the
style
of
everything
that
goes
into
the
house
thus
colonial
furniture
is
prescribed
for
a
residence
in
colonial
style
mission
furniture
for
mission
architecture
etc
there
is
a
corresponding
movement
among
makers
of
artistic
furniture
to
plan
houses
suited
to
their
particular
styles
thus
craftsman
houses
and
craftsman
furniture
are
designed
by
the
same
business
interest
since
however
the
average
american
home
is
something
of
a
composite
in
architectural
design
the
housekeeper
may
be
permitted
to
exercise
her
taste
in
making
selections
from
the
infinite
variety
of
styles
of
furniture
that
are
offered
her
by
the
manufacturers
of
the
country
it
is
advisable
however
that
the
furniture
in
each
room
be
in
harmony
let
us
briefly
examine
the
articles
of
furniture
and
styles
of
decoration
appropriate
for
the
several
rooms
the
hall
now
often
the
smallest
most
part
of
the
house
was
once
its
chief
glory
in
the
old
days
in
england
and
indeed
in
america
the
word
was
used
as
synonymous
with
the
mansion
as
bracebridge
hall
haddon
hall
etc
it
was
the
largest
apartment
the
center
of
family
and
social
life
here
the
inmates
and
their
guests
feasted
and
danced
and
sang
gradually
it
was
divided
off
into
rooms
for
specific
purposes
until
now
in
general
practice
it
has
narrowed
down
to
a
mere
vestibule
or
entrance
to
the
other
rooms
with
only
those
articles
of
furniture
in
it
which
are
useful
to
the
one
coming
in
or
going
out
of
the
house
combination
stands
with
mirror
pins
for
hanging
up
hats
and
overcoats
umbrella
holder
a
chair
or
so
or
a
settee
for
the
guest
awaiting
reception
etc
often
the
chair
or
settee
is
of
the
most
uncomfortable
design
conspiring
with
the
narrow
quarters
to
make
the
visitor
impression
of
the
house
and
its
inmates
a
very
disagreeable
one
if
space
is
lacking
to
make
the
hall
a
comfortable
and
pleasing
room
it
should
be
abolished
and
the
visitor
if
a
social
one
taken
at
once
to
the
parlor
and
if
a
business
one
to
the
where
however
size
permits
it
the
hall
should
be
made
the
most
attractive
part
of
the
house
here
is
the
proper
place
for
a
grandfather
clock
a
rug
or
so
of
artistic
design
and
a
jardiniere
holding
growing
plants
or
flowers
the
wallpaper
should
be
simple
and
dignified
in
design
but
of
cheerful
tone
some
shade
of
red
is
always
appropriate
remember
in
choosing
decorations
that
the
colors
of
the
spectrum
violet
indigo
blue
green
yellow
orange
red
run
the
gamut
of
emotive
influence
from
depression
to
exhilaration
violet
and
indigo
lower
the
spirits
blue
and
green
hold
them
in
peaceful
equilibrium
yellow
begins
to
cheer
them
and
orange
and
red
excite
them
however
the
color
scheme
of
a
hall
is
largely
dependent
upon
the
because
of
the
amount
of
this
shown
in
the
stairs
dark
red
is
a
very
suitable
color
for
the
the
best
way
to
fasten
this
is
by
a
recent
invisible
contrivance
which
goes
underneath
the
material
brass
rods
are
ornamental
rather
too
much
so
and
carpet
tacks
are
provoking
both
in
putting
down
and
taking
up
the
carpet
where
the
hall
and
stairway
are
wide
and
pictures
should
be
hung
on
the
walls
interesting
in
subject
and
cheerful
in
decorative
tone
the
presence
of
the
stairway
especially
if
this
is
broken
by
a
landing
permits
quite
a
variety
of
arrangement
the
line
of
ascent
should
be
followed
only
approximately
remember
that
it
is
a
fundamental
law
of
art
always
to
suggest
a
set
idea
but
never
to
follow
it
to
have
a
rule
in
mind
and
then
play
about
it
rather
than
strictly
pursue
it
art
is
free
and
frolicking
it
gambols
along
the
straight
path
of
utility
following
the
scent
of
airy
suggestion
into
outlying
fields
and
but
always
keeping
the
general
direction
of
the
path
the
parlor
when
this
is
not
combined
with
the
hall
should
be
furnished
and
decorated
according
to
the
chief
use
the
family
intend
to
make
of
it
if
they
are
given
to
formal
entertainment
the
color
scheme
may
be
in
high
key
that
is
a
combination
of
white
with
either
gold
rose
or
green
any
of
which
forms
a
bright
setting
for
gay
evening
costumes
but
this
decoration
is
not
advisable
in
the
case
of
the
average
american
home
since
it
is
too
fine
and
frivolous
for
the
reception
of
neighbors
in
ordinary
dress
a
quieter
more
dignified
should
be
adopted
such
as
golden
brown
with
subdued
decorations
for
the
wall
and
lace
curtains
for
the
windows
the
floor
may
be
of
hardwood
in
which
case
a
few
oriental
rugs
should
be
placed
on
the
floor
it
is
not
essential
that
these
match
the
wallpaper
for
they
are
of
the
nature
of
artistic
household
treasures
and
so
rise
autocratically
above
the
necessity
of
conformity
where
they
are
chosen
with
a
view
to
the
color
scheme
it
is
advisable
to
make
them
the
means
of
transition
from
the
hall
if
this
is
decorated
in
dark
red
the
rugs
leading
from
it
into
the
parlor
may
shade
off
from
this
into
more
golden
tones
the
design
of
the
rugs
should
be
unobtrusive
the
homemaker
should
not
feel
that
oriental
rugs
are
too
expensive
for
consideration
every
once
in
a
while
their
is
a
glut
of
them
in
the
market
owing
to
an
extensive
importation
when
they
can
be
purchased
at
a
price
which
will
always
insure
the

it
is
for
this
very
reason
that
bare

are
best
dirt
is
something
to
remove
rather
than
conceal
and
bare
floors
and
rugs
are
more
easily
cleaned
than
carpets
covering
the
entire
floor
with
plain
filling
as
a
base
for
rugs
is
an
alternative
for
either
hardwood
or

floors
it
should
be
in
the
deeper

of
the
color
employed
as
a
main
part
of
the
room
decoration
when
carpets
are
used
those
in
the
hall
parlor
and
should
not
be
fitted
into
the
corners
but
a

this
may
be
filled
with

like
all
devices
which
suggest
continuation

articles
of

which
are
suitable
for

used
chiefly
as

with
dark
frames
or
willow
chairs
and
settee
stained

these

a

incurred
in
buying
the
which
should

in
design
and
of
rich
dark
wood
preferably
mahogany
or
in
mahogany
finish
a
small
table
of
similar
design
and

should
serve
for
afternoon
tea
and
a
pretty
desk
stand
near
a
window
with
writing
materials
for
the
use
of
guests
there
should
be
a
clock
upon
the
mantelpiece
and
a
few
other
articles
of

such
as
a
vase
or
so
a
bronze
statuette
all
harmonized
by
the
common
possession
of
artistic

the

in

there
should
be
no

of
amateurishness
family
attempts
at
drawing
or
painting
crayon
portraits
all
photographs
with
the
exception
of
those
intended
as
artistic
studies
should
be
excluded

if
good
originals
by
capable
artists
are
not

fine
engravings

and
even
colored
copies
of
noted
pictures
may
take
their
place
a
few
books
well
bound
and
with
contents
worthy
of
the
binding
should
lie
on
the
parlor
table
with
a
late
magazine
or
so
for
the
entertainment
of
the
waiting
guest
there
should
be
fresh
flowers
arranged
in
pretty
bowls
to
add
their
impress
of
cheerfulness
and
beauty
to
the
room
in
most
american
homes
the
parlor
is
also
the
music
room
since
a
piano
should
be
chosen
for
quality
rather
than
appearance
an
instrument
of
any
finish
is
allowable
in
a
room
whatever
its
decorative
scheme
except
in
a
family
containing
an
expert
performer
a
piano
should
be
chosen
for
softness
and
richness
of
tone
instead
of
brilliancy
for
most
households
the
old
cottage
organ
is
a
more
practicable
instrument
than
the
concert
grand
often
found
in
a
small
parlor
where
its
piercing
notes
especially
in
combination
with
operatic
singing
are
so
confined
that
tones
and
overtones
which
should
assist
each
other
mingle
in
jarring
confusion
indeed
when
the
parlor
is
large
and
high
a
genuine
built
in
a
recess
and
harmonizing
in
finish
with
the
woodwork
of
the
room
is
not
only
the
finest
decoration
possible
but
the
most
appropriate
musical
instrument
those
families
who
possess
an
piano
such
as
thin
and
tinkly
square
are
advised
to
have
it
overhauled
and
refinished
by
a
competent
and
preserved
if
only
for
practice
by
the
children
in
case
such
an
instrument
has
overstrung
wires
it
can
be
restored
to
a
tone
that
is
better
than
that
of
the
usual
upright
piano
the
parlor
that
is
put
to
family
use
is
usually
the
best
room
to
fit
up
for
a
library
in
this
case
the
scheme
of
furnishing
and
decoration
should
differ
entirely
from
that
when
the
room
is
used
only
for
the
reception
of
guests
the
furniture
should
be
heavier
and
larger
indicating
utility
and
its
finish
as
also
that
of
the
walls
floor
and
woodwork
in
deep
shades
of
the
more
restful
colors
of
the
spectrum
is
a
good
color
for
the
the
furniture
may
be
of
this
or
even
darker
hue
there
is
no
better
style
of
furniture
for
the
library
than
the
mission
made
comfortable
by
leather
cushions
if
leather
is
thought
too
expensive
there
are
fair
substitutes
for
it
in
such
materials
as
pantasote
but
leather
should
be
procured
if
possible
it
looks
better
and
wears
longer
and
even
when
shabby
keeps
its
respectability
with
the
mission
furniture
may
be
mingled
an
upholstered
chair
or
so
such
as
a
large
sleepy
hollow
a
morris
chair
is
almost
as
comfortable
as
this
and
perhaps
upholds
the
dignity
of
the
room
a
little
better
though
it
does
not
give
the
same
suggestion
of
hominess
an
sofa
and
designed
to
be
lain
upon
should
be
placed
in
the
room
with
its
head
toward
the
light
so
that
the
occupant
may
read
while
reclining
upon
it
in
almost
every
old
house
there
is
a
sofa
either
put
away
in
the
attic
or
even
in
use
which
can
be
reupholstered
to
fit
the
of
the
room
books
naturally
form
the
chief
ornament
of
the
library
it
is
a
mistake
to
give
them
an
elaborate
casing
the
simplest
form
is
the
best
the
shelves
should
run
up
evenly
from
the
floor
to
a
more
or
less
ornamental
and
somewhat
projecting
top
terminating
several
feet
from
the
ceiling
on
this
top
a
bust
or
so
of
an
author
may
be
appropriately
placed
or
copies
of
an
ancient
statue
and
on
the
wall
above
between
the
cases
of
shelves
may
hang
a
few
pictures
not
necessarily
bookish
in
suggestion
but
reposeful
in
subject
and
tone
such
as
landscapes
and
marines
a
writing
desk
of
comfortable
size
with
its
chair
is
essential
in
every
library
it
should
be
as
far
away
as
possible
from
the
type
of
the
modern
business
desk
and
therefore
an
article
with
a
sloping
top
which
when
let
down
serves
for
the
writing
board
is
an
ideal
form
manufacturers
continue
to
make
these
desks
for
home
purposes
the
library
table
should
be
large
and
simple
one
that
is
oval
in
shape
is
the
best
for
the
family
to
gather
about
and
therefore
gives
the
most
homelike
appearance
the
illumination
of
the
library
should
center
either
upon
this
table
if
a
lamp
is
used
or
above
it
if
gas
or
electric
light
the
desk
should
have
a
of
its
own
modern
library
conveniences
are
presented
in
so
handy
and
presentable
shapes
that
the
room
may
be
perfectly
equipped
as
a
literary
workshop
without
crowding
it
or
detracting
from
its
appearance
a
dictionary
holder
wooden
not
wire
a
revolving
bookcase
for
other
works
of
reference
and
a
card
index
of
the
library
may
complete
the
equipment
it
will
be
well
to
utilize
one
or
more
of
the
drawers
of
the
desk
as
a
file
for
clippings
these
should
be
kept
in
stout
manila
envelopes
slightly
less
in
size
than
the
width
and
height
of
the
drawer
and
with
the
names
of
subjects
contained
and
arranged
in
alphabetical
order
the
carpet
should
be
plain
in
design
and
underlaid
with
padding
the
curtains
should
be
of
heavier
and
darker
stuff
than
those
in
the
parlor
and
easily
adjusted
to
admit
the
light
the
library
and
living
room
are
generally
next
each
other
and
so
each
may
and
should
have
a
fireplace
in
the
common
chimney
that
of
the
library
should
be
of
severer
design
that
of
the
more
homelike
dutch
tiles
with
pictures
that
interest
children
are
specially
appropriate
for
the
latter
where
the
father
of
the
family
demands
a
den
for
reading
and
smoking
this
may
be
a
small
room
on
the
same
general
order
as
the
library
but
with
an
emphasis
on
comfort
thus
the
sofa
should
be
replaced
by
a
wide
divan
which
may
also
serve
on
occasion
as
a
the
turkish
style
of
furnishing
is
the
customary
one
the
japanese
style
being
a
fad
that
came
in
with
the
aesthetic
craze
was
carried
to
an
uncomfortable
excess
and
has
gone
out
of
fashion
the
most
appropriate
style
for
an
american
house
is
american
indian
the
brilliant
and
strikingly
designed
navajo
blankets
may
be
used
for
both
rugs
and
couch
covers
or
hung
up
as
moqui
basketware
serves
equally
well
for
useful
purposes
such
as
and
for
ornamentation
the
pottery
of
the
pueblo
indians
being
naive
and
primitive
in
design
is
much
more
intimate
and
therefore
appropriate
than
the
japanese
which
it
replaces
the
is
the
heart
of
the
house
and
everything
in
it
should
be
of
a
nature
to
collect
loving
associations
almost
any
style
of
furniture
is
admissible
into
it
if
only
it
is
comfortable
there
should
be
for
the
woman
and
the
neighbors
who
drop
in
to
see
her

stout
enough
for
a
man
to
tip
back
upon
the
hind
legs
and
little
chairs
or
a
little
settee
by
the
fireplace
for
the
children
the
mother
desk
should
stand
here
plainer
than
the
one
in
the
library
but
of
design
similar
to
it
there
should
be
a
sofa
as
comfortable
as
the
library
one
to
which
the
mother
should
have
the
first
right
the
paper
should
be
cheerful
in
its
tone
and
with
a
definite
design
this
will
become
endeared
by
association
with
home
to
the
children
and
the

be
slow
to
replace

may
be
such
as
of
silk
or
embroidered
canvas
and
the
floor
covered
with
a
thick
preferably
of
a
nondescript
or
design
if
the
housekeeper
thinks
that
this
is
hominess
carried
to
excess
she
may
cover
the
floor
with
an
ingrain
carpet
or
better
plain
filling
of
a
medium
shade
on
which
a
few
rag

are
laid

in
color
very
artistic

rugs
are
made
out
of
old

reasonable
figures

there
still

weavers

by
housewives
for
the
price
of
their

alone
there
is
a
reason
additional
to
its
economy
why
this
practice
should
not
die
out
the
tearing
up
into
strips
of
old
garments
and
the
tacking
of
their
ends
together
with
needle
and
thread
is
work
eminently
suited
for
children
and
one
in
which
they
take
great
pride
as
it
gives
them
a
share
in
the
creation
of
a
useful
and
beautiful
household
article

be
decorated
in

with
the
quantity
of
daylight
it
receives
it
should
be
if
possible
a
light
room
with
preferably
the
morning
sun
in
this

it
is
properly
furnished
and
decorated
in
dark
tones
on
the
order
of
the

if
the
room
is
dark
the
furniture
and
should
be
warm
and
light
in
feeling
the
housekeeper
has
a
wide
variety
of
sets
of
dining
table
and
chairs
to
choose
from
whatever
she
selects
should
be
distinguished
by
the
quality
of
dignity
here
is
the
one
room
in
the
house
where
formality
is
thoroughly
in
place
it
is
at
table
where
bad
manners
are
wont
most
to
show
themselves
among
children
and
laxity
in
etiquette
among
their
parents
just
as
the
exclusive
use
of
the
room
for
eating
purposes
saves
labor
in
housework
so
will
its
dignity
in
decoration
aid
in
enforcing
the
mother
teaching
of
good
habits
to
the
children
here
if
anywhere
in
the
house
plain
should
be
used
since
the
chief
decorations
are
the
china
closet
cabinet
and
sideboard
the
ought
not
to
have
a
or
stove
if
other
means
of
heating
it
are
available
since
heat
like
food
should
be
equally
distributed
to
those
at
table
preference
in
seating
should
be
a
matter
of
honor
rather
than
of
material
advantage
comfort
and
cleanliness
are
the
qualities
which
condition
the
equipment
and
decoration
of
the
when
one
considers
that
a
third
of
a
man
life
is
spent
in
bed
it
will
be
seen
how
exceedingly
important
is
the
selection
of
this
article
of
furniture
the
essential
parts
of
a
good
bed
are
spring
and
mattress
and
no
expense
should
be
spared
here
in
securing
the
best
the
frame
which
though
the
ornamental
part
is
the
least
essential
is
a
matter
of
indifferent
consideration
there
is
no
better
kind
of
a
bedstead
than
an
iron
or
brass
one
because
of
cleanliness
and
strength
and
the
ease
with
which
it
may
be
taken
apart
and
put
together
again
the
pillows
deserve
almost
equal
consideration
with
the
mattress
since
the
feathers
used
in
stuffing
pillows
may
be
cleaned
it
is
economical
to
see
that
these
are
of
the
best
quality
bed
clothing
is
often
selected
under
the
mistaken
impression
that
weight
is
synonymous
with
warmth
and
heavy
quilted
comforts
are
chosen
instead
of
lighter
woolen
blankets
the
pure
woolen
blanket
is
the
ideal
and
in
various
degrees
of
thickness
may
serve
for
all
of
the
bed
clothes
save
the
sheets
and
the
light
white
coverlet
which
is
placed
over
all
merely
for

single
beds
rather
than
double
are
coming
into
favor
even
where
two
people
occupy
the

room
they
will
be
more
comfortable
in
different
beds
it
is
a
mistake
for
young
people
and
infants
to
sleep
with
older
people
or
for
those
who
are

and
strong
with

delicate
persons
as
there
is
apt
to
be
a
loss
of
vitality
to
the
more
vigorous
party
everything
connected
with
the
bed
should
be
regularly
and
thoroughly
sunned
and
aired
the
occupant
on
rising
should
throw
back
the
over
the
foot
of
the
bed
or
indeed
take
them
off
and
hang
them
over
a
chair
in
the
sunlight
the
first
thing
in
making
a
bed
should
be
to
turn
the
mattress
the
lower
sheet
is
then
put
on
right
side
up
and
with
the
large
end
at
the
top
this
is
tucked
in
carefully
all
around
then
the
covering
sheet
is
put
on
with
the
large
end
at
the
top
but
the
right
side
under
this
is
tucked
in
only
at
the
foot
in
order
to
permit
the
bed
to
be
easily
entered
over
these
the
blankets
are
placed
and
folded
back
at
the
head
under
the
fold
of
the
upper
sheet
should
never
be
used
as
ornamentation
on
a
bed
is
not
necessary
and
if
it
were
a
sham
is
never
an
ornament
the
walls
of
bedrooms
may
very
properly
be
painted
as
also
the
floors
to
permit
scrubbing
especially
after
the
illness
of
an
occupant
if
papered
a
chintz
pattern
is
preferable
cretonne
of
similar
design
should
then
be
used
for
furniture
slips
etc
the
woodwork
may
be
white
with
the
chairs
to

there
should
be

at

where
space
is
limited
a
combined
bureau
and
or
even
a
chiffonier
with
a

may
be

a

bedroom
may
very
appropriately
have
a
of
a
design
intended
to
interest
it
such
as
representations
of
animals
scenes
from

etc
this
is
also
suitable
for
the

the
has
come
to
be
the
de
of
the

the
place
in
which
every
conceivable
article
is
introduced
that
might
be
required
by
the
visitor
all
being
of
expensive
quality
probably
it
is
best
to
conform
to
this
practice
since
it
is
an
expected
thing
but
money
spent
on
the
beyond
that
necessary
to
make
it
simply
the
best
bedroom
in
the
house
brings
smaller
returns
in
usage
than
anywhere
else
the
average
guest
is
more
pleased
with
a
room
such
as
he
sleeps
in
himself
at
home
than
with
one
where
elegance
seems
too
fine
for
use
it
was
a
plainsman
who
being
lodged
in
such
a
room
on
a
visit
to
civilization
slept
on
the
floor
rather
than
touch
the
immaculate
and
which
he
conceived
to
be
parts
of
the
bed
clothing
not
designed
for
use
the
of
a
house
since
they
show
without
should
be
uniform
in
color
and
no
attempt
be
made
to
suit
the
individual
decoration
of
a
room
to
them
the
material
should
be
plain
holland
white
or
buff
when
there
are
outside
blinds
otherwise
green
or
blue
in
recent
years
shutters
or
outside
blinds
have
come
somewhat
into
disuse
this
is
on
the
whole
perhaps
an
improvement
for
they
are
rarely
manipulated
with
judgment
being
either
left
open
or
kept
shut
for
continuous
periods
in
the
latter
case
they
darken
rooms
which
though
unused
would
have
been
better
for
the
admission
of
sunlight
the
reason
for
this
lack
of
manipulation
is
that
they
are
opened
and
fastened
with
difficulty
from
the
inside
all
the
purpose
of
the
outside
blinds
is
served
by
inside
blinds
which
are
much
more
easily
operated
and
lend
themselves
admirably
to
decoration
one
form
of
these
known
as
venetian
blinds
consisting
of
parallel
wooden
slats
strung
on
tapes
is
coming
again
into
vogue
they
are
cheaper
than
the
usual
sort
of
blinds
and
are
very
durable
as
well
as
artistic
after
all
however
shades
are
the
most
practical
form
of
modulating
the
entrance
of
light

the

the

of
a

is

herein
nature
is
ever
urging
her
to
the
proper
course
thus
the
love
of
the
newborn
infant
prompts
the
mother
to
feed
him
with
her
own
milk
and
this
supplies
exactly
the
elements
he
requires
for
healthy
development
no
other
milk
however
skillfully
modulated
no
food
however
scientifically
prepared
can
fully
take
its
place
unless
illness
prevents
her
from
feeding
her

or
she
is
of
a
moody
and
unhappy
disposition
it
is
the
mother
place
to
give
her
breast
to
the
infant
the
condition
of
mind
of
the
mother
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
quality
of
the
milk
a
despondent
and
excitable
temperament
is
often
more
productive
of
harm
than
a
low
physical
condition
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
warn
the
mother
to
be
careful
of
her
diet
as
this
has
immediate
effect
on
the
quality
of
the
milk
of
course
any
drink
containing
alcohol
must
be
avoided
tea
and
coffee
except
when
taken
in
weak
strength
have
also
a
deleterious
effect
milk
and
next
to
it
cocoa
are
the
best
beverages
for
the
mother
mothers
should
also
avoid
taking
medicine
except
when
positively
required
there
is
no
need
for
the
mother
to
vary
greatly
her
solid
diet
she
will
naturally
select
that
which
is
most
nutritious
and
easily
digested
anything
that
tends
to
make
her
costive
such
as
fruits
or
green
vegetables
should
be
partaken
of
with
discrimination
the
baby
should
be
fed
with
systematic
regularity
from
the
beginning
while
a
child
does
not
need
food
for
the
first
day
after
birth
nevertheless
it
is
well
to
put
it
to
the
breast
about
six
hours
after
birth
since
for
the
first
few
days
after
the
breasts
secrete
a
laxative
element
which
acts
as
a
sort
of
physic
upon
the
child
clearing
its
bowels
of
a
black
tarry
substance
that
fills
them
the
full
supply
of
normal
milk
comes
after
the
third
day
after
the
first
feeding
the
baby
should
be
put
to
the
breast
every
four
hours
for
the
first
day
and
after
that
every
two
hours
being
kept
there
about
twenty
minutes
each
time
the
mother
should
be
watchful
and
see
that
the
child
is
awake
and
is
nursing
even
at
this
early
age
it
can
be
compelled
to
learn
a
good
habit
unless
it
learns
this
habit
the
mother
will
be
put
to
great
inconvenience
and
the
baby
will
suffer
because
of
the
disarrangement
of
the
systematic
feeding
if
he
is
allowed
to
nurse
at
his
own
pleasure
the
results
will
quickly
make
themselves
manifest
in
the
form
of
colic
leading
to
wakefulness
and
bad
temper
a
baby
should
not
remain
awake
more
than
four
hours
in
the
day
on
the
whole
and
he
should
be
so
trained
that
the
eight
hours
from
ten
at
night
to
six
in
the
morning
when
his
mother
is
sleeping
should
be
for
him
also
an
uninterrupted
period
of
slumber
the
baby
should
be
weaned
at
ten
months
unless
he
is
unwell
at
the
time
or
the
weaning
comes
in
the
heat
of
the
summer
when
there
is
danger
of
his
becoming
sickly
or
peevish
preparatory
to
weaning
the
baby
should
be
accustomed
to
the
bottle
provided
the
bottle
holds
half
a
pint
or
four
glasses
the
number
of
bottles
may
be
increased
from
one
a
day
at
four
months
to
two
or
six
at
eight
months
the
baby
should
certainly
be
weaned
by
the
time
it
is
a
year
old
as
even
though
the
mother
continues
to
have
a
plentiful
supply
of
milk
this
is
not
suited
to
his
needs
at
this
stage
of
his
physical
development
by
this
method
of
approach
the
act
of
permanently
refusing
the
breast
to
the
child
will
not
greatly
offend
him
after
a
little
crying
he
will
philosophically
accept
the
situation
and
reconcile
himself
to
the
substitute
weaning
is
rendered
easier
by
selecting
a
which
has
the
nipple
in
the
shape
of
the
breast
care
should
be
taken
that
the
hole
in
the
nipple
is
not
too
large
supplying
more
milk
than
the
stomach
can
take
care
of
as
it
comes
and
so
causing
stomachic
disorder
the
nursing
bottle
should
at
all
times
be
kept
thoroughly
clean
by
rinsing
in
hot
water
and
washing
in
hot
soapsuds
the
milk
for
the
child
bottle
should
wherever
possible
be
what
is
called
certified
that
is
the
milk
from
a
herd
of
cows
which
have
been
declared
by
the
proper
authorities
to
be
all
in
good
health
and
which
have
been
milked
under
sanitary
conditions
this
milk
is
delivered
in
clean
sealed
bottles
preventing
the
admission
of
any
dirt
or
deleterious
substance
from
the
time
it
leaves
the
dairy
till
opened
the
milk
for
the
baby
should
not
be
purchased
from
the
can
milk
that
has
been
sterilized
that
is
bottled
and
put
in
boiling
water
for
an
hour
is
not
so
good
for
the
baby
as
pasteurized
milk
that
is
milk
kept
at
something
less
than
the
boiling
point
for
half
an
hour
since
the
higher
temperature
causes
the
milk
to
lose
some
of
the
qualities
beneficial
to
the
child
since
cow
milk
differs
in
its
constituents
from
mother
having
more
fat
and
less
sugar
there
will
be
need
at
first
to
modify
the
milk
weakening
and
sweetening
it
somewhat
one
good
recipe
for
modifying
cows
milk
is
one
part
milk
two
parts
cream
two
parts
three
parts
sugar
water
the
sugar
water
being
made
by
putting
two
even
teaspoonfuls
of
sugar
of
milk
in
a
pint
of
water
condensed
milk
which
is
often
used
as
a
substitute
for
cows
milk
is
not
nearly
so
good
since
it
has
lost
in
the
process
of
condensation
one
of
the
most
important
elements
that
which
forms
bone
tissue
accordingly
babies
fed
upon
condensed
milk
are
apt
to
be
rickety
and
they
lack
in
general
power
to
resist
disease
which
is
primarily
the
mark
of
a
baby
fed
on
mother
milk
and
to
a
slightly
lesser
degree
one
fed
upon
cows
milk
the
stomach
grows
very
rapidly
during
infancy
increasing
from
a
capacity
of
one
ounce
soon
after
birth
to
eight
ounces
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
this
should
be
taken
into
account
by
the
increase
of
the
amount
supplied
it
after
the
first
week
a
baby
should
increase
in
weight
at
the
rate
of
one
pound
a
month
for
the
first
six
months
if
he
falls
behind
this
rate
and
remains
healthy
more
sugar
and
fat
may
be
introduced
into
his
milk
if
however
he
fails
to
gain
weight
and
is
sickly
the
milk
should
be
diluted
and
modified
so
as
to
make
it
easier
of
digestion
every
mother
should
be
warned
against
a
common
practice
of
starting
the
flow
of
milk
from
the
nipple
of
the
bottle
by
putting
it
in
her
mouth
gums
and
teeth
are
rarely
perfectly
clean
and
so
form
the
favorite
lurking
place
for
disease
germs
which
though
they
may
not
produce
disease
in
the
stronger
body
of
the
adult
may
do
so
and
often
do
so
in
the
more
susceptible
physique
of
the
child
just
as
the
child
was
trained
to
the
bottle
while
it
was
still
taking
the
mother
milk
so
it
should
be
taught
gradually
to
eat
solids
while
it
is
fed
upon
the
bottle
after
the
child
has
been
weaned
at
the
tenth
month
he
can
be
fed
occasionally
on
broths
or
beef
juice
as
a
substitute
for
one
of
the
milk
feedings
the
broth
is
more
of
a
stimulant
than
a
food
aiding
digestion
rather
than
supplying
nourishment
during
the
eleventh
month
the
yolk
of
a
soft
boiled
egg
mixed
with
stale
bread
crumbs
may
be
added
to
the
diet
together
with
a
little
orange
juice
or
prune
jelly
the
latter
will
tend
to
keep
his
bowels
free
after
twelve
months
the
child
may
be
gradually
accustomed
to
eat
stale
bread
biscuit
or
toast
broken
in
milk
thoroughly
cooked
oatmeal
and
similar
cereals
baked
potatoes
moistened
with
broth
mashed
potatoes
moistened
with
gravy
and
rice
pudding
the
pudding
is
made
of
two
tablespoonfuls
of
clean
rice
half
a
teaspoonful
of
salt
of
a
cupful
of
sugar
in
five
cups
of
milk
bake
in
buttered
pudding
dish
from
two
to
three
hours
in
slow
oven
stirring
frequently
to
prevent
rice
from
settling
at
the
age
of
two
years
and
a
half
the
child
may
be
permitted
to
eat
meat
preferably
roast
beef
or
mutton
cooked
rare
or
minced
roast
poultry
even
though
sugar
is
a
very
essential
ingredient
in
the
child
diet
it
is
very
unwise
to
let
it
have
this
outside
of
its
regular
diet
pure
candy
does
not
hurt
the
child
by
impairing
its
digestion
so
much
as
by
interfering
with
its
appetite
for
plain
food
the
child
should
never
be
allowed
to
form
an
inordinate
appetite
for
anything
as
this
is
certain
to
cause
a
corresponding
deficiency
elsewhere
in
his
diet
even
worse
than
the
practice
of
giving
candy
to
very
young
children
is
that
of
teaching
them
to
drink
tea
and
coffee
these
are
pure
stimulants
supplying
no
element
and
taking
the
place
of
nutritious
beverages
that
do
such
as
milk
and
cocoa
after
a
child
is
old
enough
to
be
permitted
to
partake
with
discrimination
of
the
general
food
of
the
table
he
should
be
allowed
to
eat
with
the
family
from
the
beginning
he
should
be
taught
table
manners
the
use
of
knife
and
fork
and
napkin
and
the
subordination
of
his
wishes
to
those
of
older
people
next
to
feeding
the
baby
properly
the
most
important
duty
of
the
mother
is
to
see
that
it
is
kept
clean
even
in
its
nursing
days
after
each
feeding
she
should
rinse
its
mouth
out
by
a
weak
boracic
acid
solution
since
particles
of
milk
may
remain
there
which
may
become
a
source
of
infection
it
is
well
for
similar
reason
to
wash
her
own
breasts
with
the
solution
a
baby
should
be
bathed
regularly
at
about
the
same
time
each
day
during
the
first
days
of
a
child
life
he
should
be
sponged
in
a
warm
room
with
water
at
blood
heat
in
removing
the
garments
the
mother
should
roll
the
infant
gently
from
side
to
side
rather
than
lift
him
bodily
it
is
well
to
have
a
flannel
cloth
or
apron
ready
to
cover
the
child
when
it
is
being
undressed
the
baby
face
should
be
washed
in
clear
water
firmly
and
thoroughly
with
a
damp
cloth
and
dried
by
patting
with
the
towel
then
soap
should
be
added
to
the
water
and
the
other
parts
of
the
baby
body
washed
in
it
first
the
head
ears
and
neck
then
the
arms
one
uncovered
at
a
time
then
with
the
hand
reaching
under
the
cover
the
back
during
which
process
the
baby
is
laid
flat
on
the
stomach
then
the
stomach
and
last
the
legs
one
at
a
time
the
baby
being
kept
covered
by
the
flannel
as
much
as
these
operations
permit
the
eyes
of
infants
are
prone
to
inflammation
and
therefore
require
special
attention
in
the
way
of
cleansing
this
can
be
done
best
by
the
use
of
the
boracic
solution
upon
a
fresh
pledget
of
cotton
be
careful
not
to
use
the
same
piece
of
cotton
for
both
eyes
and
to
burn
it
after
use
when
the
nose
is
stopped
with
mucous
a
similar
means
can
be
used
for
cleansing
it
every
mother
should
study
the
individual
nature
and
disposition
of
her
child
in
order
to
know
what
to
do
for
it
when
it
cries
for
a
cry
may
mean
as
well
as
colic
or
a
wet
diaper
colic
is
often
quickly
relieved
by
turning
the
baby
upon
his
stomach
and
rubbing
his
back

should

something
on
the
order
of
the
breakfast
in
the
early
days
children
were
fed
at
night
on
hasty
pudding
or
cornmeal
which
is
an
ideal
food
when
thoroughly
prepared
the
meal
being
slowly
sprinkled
into
the
pot
which
was
stirred
constantly
all
the
while
the
north
italians
prepare

in

mush
which
they
call
polenta
forms
an
accompaniment
of

affording

nutritious

the

can
do
little
to
impair

while
it
certainly
whets
the
appetite
before
eating
and
pleases
the
palate
when
the
food
is
in
the
mouth
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
those
foods
which
require
much
mastication
ought
especially
to
be
made
palatable
in
order
to
be
chewed
thoroughly
therefore
starchy
materials
ought
to
be
prepared
in
appetizing
ways
on
the
other
hand
meats
which
require
less
mastication
may
dispense
with
high
seasoning
and
rich
sauces
especially
as
they
have
their
own
natural
flavors
the
mother
should
closely
follow
the
work
of
the
child
at
school
and
aid
this
in
every
way
at
home
she
should
patiently
answer
his
many
questions
except
when
she
is
convinced
that
he
is
not
really
in
search
of
information
but
is
asking
them
merely
for
the
sake
of
asking
wherever
the
child
ought
to
be
able
to
reason
out
the
answer
the
mother
should
assist
him
to
do
so
by
asking
him
guiding
questions
in
turn
this
is
the
method
that
socrates
the
greatest
of
teachers
and
philosophers
employed
with
his
pupils
and
indeed
with
his
own
children
it
is
as
useful
in
inculcating
moral
lessons
as
in
teaching
facts
when
one
of
the
sons
of
socrates
lamprocles
came
to
him
complaining
that
the
mother
xanthippe
treated
him
so
hardly
that
he
could
not
bear
it
the
philosopher
by
kindly
questions
led
the
boy
to
acknowledge
his
great
debt
to
her
for
her
care
of
him
in
infancy
and
in
sickness
and
by
showing
the
many
things
xanthippe
had
to
try
her
patience
persuaded
him
to
bear
with
her
and
to
give
her
that
love
which
was
her
due
where
manual
training
is
taught
in
the
schools
the
mother
should
give
every
opportunity
to
her
children
to
practice
it
at
home
where
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
school
course
parents
should
study
to
devise
home
substitutes
for
it
the
mother
teaching
the
girls
sewing
embroidery
and
the
father
instructing
the
boys
in
carpentry
and
the
like
the
desire
to
collect
things
which
seizes
boys
and
girls
at
an
early
age
should
be
turned
into
useful
channels
by
teachers
and
parents
often
this
valuable
instinct
is
largely
wasted
as
in
the
collecting
of
the
impulse
which
it
gives
to
geographical
and
historical
investigation
being
grossly
perverted
for
example
a
little
island
that
once
issued
a
stamp
which
is
now
rare
looming
larger
in
importance
than
a
great
country
none
of
the
stamps
of
which
have
any
special
value
every
school
or
failing
this
every
home
should
have
a
museum
not
so
much
of
curiosities
as
of
typical
specimens
these
may
be
geological
botanical
faunal
or
archaeological
the
rocks
and
soils
and
clays
of
the
home
country
the
flowers
of
plants
and
sections
of
wood
of
trees
the
skins
of
animals
and
birds
taxidermy
is
a
fascinating
employment
for
the
young
eggs
and
nests
here
the
child
should
be
taught
to
be
a
naturalist
and
not
a
vandal
and
indian
and
in
this
connection
it
should
be
suggested
that
the
most
valuable
collection
of
all
is
a
herbarium
of
the
flowers
of
literature
specimens
of
which
may
be
found
in
the
home
library
that
a
child
is
not
fond
of
reading
is
testimony
that
his
parents
no
less
than
his
teachers
have
failed
in
their
duty
above
all
the
parents
should
see
that
their
boys
and
girls
have
facilities
for
that
physical
culture
which
is
necessary
for
health
and
proper
development
those
exercises
which
are
both
recreative
and
useful
are
preferable
gardening
may
be
made
a
delight
instead
of
a
hardship
if
the
child
is
allowed
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
his
labor
let
him
sell
the
vegetables
he
raises
to
the
family
and
if
there
is
an
excess
to
the
neighbors
for
pocket
money
he
will
enjoy
purchasing
his
own
clothing
even
more
than
using
the
money
solely
for
his
pleasures
healthful
sports
should
be
encouraged
and
games
such
as
chess
that
develops
the
intellect
there
are
many
card
games
such
as
authors
that
impart
useful
instruction
in
literature
history
natural
science
business
etc
playing
these
in
the
home
is
a
good
thing
no
less
for
parent
than
child
many
a
mother
has
acquired
a
culture
after
her
marriage
through
her
determination
to
keep
ahead
of
the
children
in
their
studies
and
intellectual
activities
the
child
should
be
early
accustomed
to
take
cold
baths
and
then
run
about
naked
in
a
room
under
the
impulse
given
by
the
tingling
glow
of
reaction
if
a
play
is
made
of
the
bath
the
habit
will
be
formed
for
life
and
in
this
way
one
of
the
mother
chief
struggles
to
make
the
children
clean
themselves
will
be
abolished
it
is
natural
for
a
child
to
get
dirty
and
therefore
it
should
be
made
as
habitual
an
impulse
for
them
to
get
clean
again
of
all
such
habits
keeping
the
teeth
clean
is
most
important
children
teeth
are
a
chief
source
of
anxiety
to
the
mother
even
before
they
make
their
appearance
troubles
in
teething
are
generally
due
to
innutritious
and
food
sometimes
however
when
the
food
is
all
right
the
teeth
will
still
have
difficulty
in
coming
through
the
gums
whenever
the
mother
observes
that
her
crying
child
refuses
to
bring
its
gums
together
on
anything
she
should
examine
them
and
if
they
are
swollen
have
them
lanced
the
even
though
they
are
temporary
should
be
looked
after
carefully
as
their
decay
will
often
spread
to
the
coming
permanent
teeth
besides
they
should
be
preserved
as
long
as
possible
and
in
the
best
condition
to
aid
in
mastication
accordingly
young
children
should
be
taught
regularly
to
rinse
out
their
mouths
and
to
use
a
and
a
child
should
run
barefoot
as
much
as
conditions
and
climate
permit
when
it
wears
shoes
these
should
conform
as
much
as
possible
to
the
shape
of
the
foot
with
such
footwear
the
active
child
may
form
for
life
the
habit
of
a
natural
gait
especially
if
parents
will
point
out
the
beauty
and
advantages
of
this
and
praise
the
men
and
women
of
their
acquaintance
who
possess
it
it
is
about
the
time
when
a
girl
is
learning
in
the
high
school
that
she
is
tempted
by
vanity
and
the
desire
to
be
like
the
other
girls
to
put
on
french
heels
then
it
is
that
the
teacher
or
mother
should
quote
to
her
the
line
of
the
about
venus
the
true
goddess
is
shown
by
her
gait
and
save
her
from
an
irreparable
folly
if
mothers
will
remember
that
children
are
not
dolls
and
that
mothers
are
not
children
to
take
pleasure
in
bedecking
them
they
will
need
no
advice
about
dressing
their
little
ones
there
is
only
one
rule
for
her
to
follow
she
should
consult
the
comfort
and
health
of
the
child
and
as
far
as
consistent
with
these
the
convenience
to
herself
it
may
be
cute
to
dress
a
child
like
a
miniature
man
or
woman
but
it
is
cruel
to
the
child
there
is
no
reason
for
distinguishing
sex
by
dress
in
young
children
jumpers
form
the
best
dress
for
either
a
little
boy
or
little
girl
in
which
to
play
even
when
they
are
older
and
a
skirt
distinguishes
the
girl
bloomers
or
knickerbockers
of
the
same
material
beneath
approach
the
ideal
of
dress
for
comfort
health
and
decency
more
nearly
than
white
petticoat
and
drawers
indeed
the
skirt
is
best
when
it
is
a
part
of
a
blouse
which
is
also
a
suitable
dress
for
a
boy
a
child
should
never
be
tortured
with
a
large
or
stiff
hat
the
heads
of
children
come
up
to
the
middles
of
men
and
women
and
such
a
hat
will
be
crushed
in
a
crowd
and
its
poor
little
wearer
placed
in
mortal
terror
indeed
children
should
be
allowed
to
go
bareheaded
as
much
as
possible
and
when
they
wear
hats
have
these
simple
in
shape
and
soft
in
material
the
plain
cap
is
the
best
head
covering
for
a
boy
the
may
be
a
little
more
ornamental
especially
in
color
the
universal
seizure
by
the
sex
upon
the
boy
tam
as
peculiarly
suited
for
a
play
and
is
therefore
right
and
proper
for
a
more
showy
style
lingerie
hats
are
justified
but
the
most
beautiful
and
appropriate
form
of
the
best
hat
for
a
little
girl
is
one
of
uniform
material
straw
cloth
or
felt
with
simple
crown
and
wide
and
more
or
less
soft
brim
ornamented
by
a
ribbon
alone
the
addition
of
a
single
flower
may
be
permitted
though
this
is
like
the
admission
of
the
camel
nose
into
the
tent
it
may
lead
to
the
entrance
of
the
hump
the
monstrosity
of
the
modern
woman
bonnet
which
of
late
years
has
by
terms
imitated
a
flower
garden
a
vegetable
garden
an
orchard
and
finally
with
the
chanticler
fad
a
the
knickerbocker
and
the
short
skirt
are
aesthetic
that
is
because
they
mark
a
natural
division
of
the
body
at
the
knee
there
is
an
artistic
justification
therefore
in
mothers
keeping
their
sons
out
of
long
pants
as
long
as
possible
and
in
fathers
for
it
is
they
who
are
the
chief
objectors
in
opposing
their
desire
to
don
the
skirt
that
marks
attainment
to
womanhood
here
however
it
is
proper
that
the
wishes
of
the
younger
generation
triumph
it
is
a
social
instinct
to
conform
to
the
custom
of
one
fellows
and
the
children
have
reached
the
age
of
consent
in
matters
of
fashion
their
fathers
and
mothers
may
lend
their
influence
to
abolish
foolish
customs
or
to
modify
them
in
the
direction
of
wisdom
but
it
is
best
that
this
be
in
their
capacity
as
citizens
and
not
as
parents

john
wesley
in
all
her
multitudinous
concerns
the
housekeeper
should
not
forget
her
duties
toward
herself
many
a
mother
in
looking
out
that
her
children
are
a
credit
to
the
family
in
dress
and
manners
and
care
of
their

gives
up
all
thought
of
standing
as
an
exemplar
of
these
things
among
the
ladies
of
the
community
this
is
a
sacrifice
of
self
that
is
not
commendable
since
it
defeats
its
purpose
the
mother
should
always
be
herself
an
illustration
of
the
lessons
she
teaches
else
they
will
not
be
seriously
considered
it
is
impossible
here
to
give
more
than
a
few
general
suggestions
as
to
the
dress
and
millinery
of
the
mother
she
should
have
a
variety
of
simple
suited
to
her
various
duties
and
these
should
be
kept
as
neat
as
possible
each
should
be
made
for
its
purpose
not
converted
to
it
from
one
of
her
fine
dresses
nothing
gives
an
impression
of
slatternliness
more
than
the
wearing
about
the
house
of
a
frayed
and
soiled
garment
that
has
seen
better
days
the
best
dresses
and

of
a
woman
even
one
who
goes
little
into

should
also
be
sufficient
in
number
and
varied
in
style
to
suit
the
changing
seasons
of
the
year
and
the
widely
differing
occasions
for
use
which
occur
in
every
station
of
life
the
purchase
of
several
good
articles
of
attire
rather
than
one
or
two
is
economical
in
the
end
there
is
not
only
the
obvious
mathematical
reason
that
if
one
dress
wears
a
year
four
dresses
must
be
bought
in
four
years
whether
this
is
done
simultaneously
or
successively
but
there
is
the
physical
reason
that
a
dress
like
a
person
that
has
regular
periods
of
rest
becomes
restored
in
quality
accordingly
all
dresses
should
be
laid
very
carefully
away
when
not
in
use
and
the
proper
means
taken
to
refresh
them
unfortunately
the
arbitrary
and
senseless
changes
in

render
this
practice
hard
to
follow
no

by

garments

although
the
arbiters

in
the

of

try
by
violent
changes

impracticable
these

fantastic
if
too
new
or
old
be
not
the
first
by
whom
the
new
are
tried
nor
yet
the
last
to
lay
the

aside
some
of
the
women
in
artistic
and
musical
circles
design
their
clothes
wholly
to
suit
their
personal
appearance
with
such
success
that
their
independence
of
the
prevailing
mode
of
large
or
small
hats
or
sleeves
striped
or
checked
fabrics
wins
universal
admiration
remember
that
a
dress
or
a
hat
is
never
a
creation
in
itself
the
wearer
must
always
be
considered
short
stout
women
should
avoid
horizontal
stripes
or
lines
of
ornamentation
that
call
attention
to
breadth
and
should
choose
those
perpendicular
stripes
and
lines
which
tend
to
give
an
impression
of
height
and
slenderness
a
hat
lining
may
be
used
to
put
rosiness
into
a
pale
face
and
a
color
may
be
selected
for
a
dress
which
will
neutralize
too
much
redness
in
the
skin
but
these
are
matters
of
common
knowledge
to
all
women
the
trouble
is
that
in
their
desire
to
be
in
style
many
women
forget
or
even
deliberately
ignore
these
fundamental
principles
of
art
in
dress
fondness
for
a
particular
color
as
a
color
causes
many
women
to
wear
it
regardless
of
its
relation
to
their
complexion
and
there
have
been
women
of
mystical
mind
who
believing
that
each
quality
of
soul
had
its
correspondent
in
a
particular
hue
wore
those
colors
which
they
thought
were
significant
of
their
chief
traits
of
character
with
weird
results
as
you
may
imagine
it
is
unnecessary
in
this
book
of
practical
suggestions
to
discuss
in
detail
the
question
of
etiquette
which
may
be
defined
as
the
prevailing
fashion
in
social
intercourse
styles
in
visiting
cards
change
from
year
to
year
and
the
social
usages
of
one
city
differ
from
another
if
it
is
required
to
know
these
the
latest
special
work
on
etiquette
should
be
procured
the
general
principles
of
good
manners
however
which
lie
at
the
basis
of
etiquette
just
as
good
morals
form
the
foundation
of
law
although
there
are
discrepancies
in
both
cases
may
appropriately
be
presented
here
though
briefly
good
manners
and
good
morals
alike
follow
the
golden
rule
whatsoever
ye
would
that
others
should
do
to
you
do
ye
even
so
to
them
egotism
and
selfishness
are
the
bane
of
both
true
politeness
consists
in
considering
the
pleasure
of
others
as
a
thing
in
itself
without
regard
to
your
own
advantage
if
an
attention
is
paid
a
gift
given
a
service
rendered
these
should
be
done
solely
for
the
recipient
happiness
not
with
a
view
to
his
making
a
return
in
kind
possibly
with
interest
it
is
good
manners
to
call
on
people
who
will
be
pleased
to
see
you
not
on
those
whom
you
wish
to
see
but
to
whom
you
and
your
affairs
are
of
no
concern
a
first
visit
to
a
newcomer
in
town
is
right
and
proper
a
stranger
is
presumed
to
be
desirous
of
making
friends
but
the
first
call
ought
to
indicate
whether
or
not
he
and
you
have
that
community
of
interest
which
is
essential
to
friendship
if
you
are
the
newcomer
it
is
your
duty
to
show
your
appreciation
of
the
attention
by
returning
first
calls
but
you
should
so
act
that
your
hosts
will
feel
free
to
continue
the
acquaintance
if
it
will
be
agreeable
to
them
or
discontinue
it
if
it
is
not
indeed
in
every
situation
you
should
give
the
other
party
this
choice
friendship
is
one
of
the
most
valuable
forms
of
social
energy
and
it
should
carefully
be
conserved
yet
more
than
any
other
form
it
is
wasted
because
of
a
false
regard
for
social
conventions
at
how
many
calls
are
both
parties
bored
how
many
persons
women
in
particular
who
have
not
the
man
freedom
in
selecting
associates
continue
in
the
treadmill
round
of
an
uncongenial
social
circle
to
escape
from
this
may
require
the
special
exercise
of
will
and
the
incurring
of
criticism
but
these
ought
to
be
assumed
however
in
most
cases
a
woman
may
gradually
escape
from
the
distasteful
circle
and
form
new
and
more
congenial
friends
without
remark
after
the
brightening
effects
on
mind
and
spirits
of
social
intercourse
comes
the
advantage
of
toning
up
the
personal
appearance
a
decent
in
dress
should
always
be
flavored
with
a
touch
of
pride
for
this
is
an
excellent
preservative
to
have
a
proper
pride
there
must
be
the
incentive
of
the
presence
of
other
people
whose
admiration
we
may
win
pride
in
dress
is
naturally
conjoined
with
the
care
of
the
person
there
is
an
excellent
term
for
this
which
though
borrowed
from
the
stable
carries
with
it
only
sweet
and
wholesome
suggestions
it
is
a
woman
is
not
only
a
woman
but
one
who
like
a
favorite
mare
is
always
spick
and
span
in
her
person
and
happy
in

quiet
consciousness
of
it
and
every
woman
whether
she
possesses
a

owen
meredith
all
the
other
duties
of
the
housewife
are
subsidiary
to
the
great
subject
of
preparing
food
for
the
household
the
care
of
the
home
the
care
of
health
all
either
bear
upon
this
work
or
require
ability
to
perform
it
with
decks
cleared
for
action
therefore
we
will
proceed
to
discuss
the
fundamental
principles
of
cookery
the
application
of
which
in
the
form
of
specific
recipes
will
follow
in
a
separate
chapter
in
the
limited
space
which
can
be
here
devoted
to
the
subject
it
will
be
assumed
that
the
housewife
is
a
cook
and
can
follow
plain
directions
and
that
she
is
familiar
with
the
methods
of
preparing
the
ordinary
meals
that
are
universal
throughout
the
country
it
will
be
also
taken
for
granted
that
she
has
one
or
more
general
cook
books
containing
a
wide
variety
of
recipes
for
the
making
of
bread
in
its
various
forms
cakes
pies
omelettes
salads
desserts
and
the
discussion
will
be
confined
to
meats
wherein
owing
to
advancing
prices
new
economical
methods
of
preparation
are
coming
into
practice
based
upon
a
scientific
knowledge
of
food
values
vegetarianism
and
fruitarianism
are
being
adopted
by
many
households
less
as
a
matter
of
principle
than
as
a
recourse
from
what
are
considered
the
present
prohibitive
prices
of
meats
now
the
proper
way
to
solve
a
problem
is
not
to
evade
it
but
to
face
it
and
conquer
it
and
this
is
eminently
true
of
the
meat
problem
granted
that
the
proportion
of
family
income
devoted
to
food
can
not
be
increased
it
is
a
fact
that
by
an
intelligent
study
of
the
food
value
of
the
different
kinds
of
meat
and
of
economic
ways
of
preparing
them
the
expense
of
living
may
be
maintained
at
the
former
rate
if
not
indeed
materially
lessened
with
a
great
increase
in
both
the
nutritive
value
and
the
palatability
of
the
family
meals
the
new
nationalism
of
america
which
after
all
is
only
the
turning
to
newer
needs
of
the
old
nationalism
that
gave
homesteads
to
the
people
and
supplied
them
with
improved
methods
of
agriculture
is
rightly
taking
the
lead
in
the
scientific
education
of
the
housekeeper
in
this
household
economy
with
special
regard
to
the
requirements
of
the
people
in
these
days
of
rising
prices
especially
of
meats
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture
has
issued
a
booklet
prepared
by
langworthy
and
caroline
hunt
experts
in
nutrition
connected
with
the
department
which
gives
authoritative
information
about
the
cheaper
cuts
of
meat
and
the
preparation
of
inexpensive
meat
dishes
this
has
become
generally
known
as
the
government
cook
book
by
the
permission
of
the
department
we
here
present
portions
of
the
information
it
contains
together
with
those
recipes
which
best
illustrate
the
principles
of
meat
cookery
for
the
home
table
value
of
meat
as
food
considering
the
fact
that
meat
forms
such
an
important
part
of
the
diet
and
the
further
fact
that
the
price
of
meat
as
of
other
foods
has
advanced
in
recent
years
it
is
natural
for
housekeepers
to
seek
more
economical
methods
of
preparing
meat
for
the
table
and
to
turn
their
thoughts
toward
the
less
expensive
cuts
and
ask
what
economy
is
involved
in
their
use
how
they
may
be
prepared
and
whether
the
less
expensive
dishes
are
as
nutritious
and
as
thoroughly
and
easily
digested
as
the
costlier
ones
the
value
of
meat
as
food
depends
chiefly
on
the
presence
of
two
classes
of
nutrients
protein
or
nitrogenous
compounds
and
fat
the
mineral
matter
it
contains
particularly
the
phosphorus
compounds
is
also
of
much
importance
though
it
is
small
in
quantity
protein
is
essential
for
the
construction
and
maintenance
of
the
body
and
both
protein
and
fat
yield
energy
for
muscular
power
and
for
keeping
up
the
temperature
of
the
body
fat
is
especially
important
as
a
source
of
energy
it
is
possible
to
combine
the
fat
and
protein
of
animal
foods
so
as
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
body
with
such
materials
only
and
this
is
done
in
the
arctic
regions
where
vegetable
food
is
lacking
but
in
general
it
is
considered
that
diet
is
better
and
more
wholesome
when
in
addition
to
animal
foods
such
as
meat
which
is
rich
in
proteins
and
fats
it
contains
vegetable
foods
which
are
richest
in
sugar
starch
and
other
carbohydrates
both
animal
and
vegetable
foods
supply
the
mineral
substances
which
are
essential
to
body
growth
and
development
the
difference
between
the
various
cuts
of
meat
consists
chiefly
in
amount
of
fat
and
consequently
in
the
fuel
value
to
the
body
so
far
as
the
proteins
are
concerned
the
substances
which
build
and
repair
the
important
tissues
of
the
body
very
little
difference
is
found
this
general
uniformity
in
proportion
of
protein
makes
it
easy
for
the
housekeeper
who
does
not
wish
to
enter
into
the
complexities
of
food
values
to
make
sure
that
her
family
is
getting
enough
of
this
nutrient
from
the
investigations
carried
on
in
the
office
of
experiment
stations
the
conclusion
has
been
drawn
that
of
the
total
amount
of
protein
needed
every
day
which
is
usually
estimated
to
be
grams
or
ounces
or
grams
is
taken
in
the
form
of
animal
food
which
of
course
includes
milk
eggs
poultry
fish
as
well
as
meat
the
remainder
is
taken
in
the
form
of
bread
and
other
cereal
foods
and
beans
and
other
vegetables
the
portion
of
cooked
meat
which
may
be
referred
to
as
an
ordinary
helping
to
ounces
equivalent
to
to
ounces
of
raw
meat
may
be
considered
to
contain
some
to
grams
of
protein
or
approximately
half
of
the
amount
which
is
ordinarily
secured
from
animal
food
an
egg
or
a
glass
of
milk
contains
about
grams
more
so
the
housekeeper
who
gives
each
adult
member
of
her
family
a
helping
of
meat
each
day
and
eggs
milk
or
cheese
together
with
the
puddings
or
other
dishes
which
contain
eggs
and
milk
can
feel
sure
that
she
is
supplying
sufficient
protein
for
the
remainder
necessary
will
be
supplied
by
bread
cereals
and
other
vegetable
food
the
nutrition
investigations
of
the
office
of
experiment
stations
show
also
that
there
is
practically
no
difference
between
the
various
cuts
of
meat
or
the
meats
from
different
animals
with
respect
to
either
the
thoroughness
or
the
ease
with
which
they
are
digested
therefore
those
who
wish
to
use
the
cheaper
cuts
need
not
feel
that
in
so
doing
their
families
are
less
well
nourished
than
by
the
more
expensive
meats
relative
values
and
prices
of
the
cuts
of
meat
the
relative
retail
prices
of
the
various
cuts
usually
bear
a
direct
relation
to
the
favor
with
which
they
are
regarded
by
the
majority
of
persons
the
juicy
tender
cuts
of
good
flavor
selling
for
the
higher
prices
when
porterhouse
steak
sells
for
cents
a
pound
it
may
be
assumed
that
in
town
or
village
markets
round
steak
would
ordinarily
sell
for
about
cents
and
chuck
ribs
one
of
the
best
cuts
of
the
forequarter
for
cents
this
makes
it
appear
that
the
chuck
ribs
are
less
than
half
as
expensive
as
porterhouse
steak
and
as
expensive
as
the
round
but
apparent
economy
is
not
always
real
economy
and
in
this
case
the
bones
in
the
three
cuts
should
be
taken
into
account
of
the
chuck
ribs
more
than
is
bone
or
other
materials
usually
classed
under
the
head
of
waste
or
refuse
of
the
round
is
waste
and
of
the
porterhouse
in
buying
the
chuck
then
the
housewife
gets
at
the
prices
assumed
less
than
pound
of
food
for
cents
making
the
net
price
of
the
edible
portion
cents
a
pound
in
buying
round
she
gets
of
a
pound
for
cents
making
the
net
value
about
cents
in
buying
porterhouse
she
gets
of
a
pound
for
cents
making
the
net
value
about
cents
a
pound
the
relative
prices
therefore
of
the
edible
portions
are
and
cents
or
to
put
it
in
a
different
way
a
dollar
at
the
prices
assumed
will
buy
pounds
of
solid
meat
from
the
cut
known
as
chuck
pounds
of
such
meat
from
the
round
and
only
pounds
of
such
meat
from
the
porterhouse
to
this
should
be
added
the
fact
that
because
of
the
way
in
which
porterhouse
is
usually
cooked
no
nutriment
is
obtained
from
the
bone
while
by
the
long
slow
process
by
which
the
cheaper
cuts
except
when
they
are
broiled
or
fried
are
prepared
the
gelatin
fat
and
flavoring
material
of
the
bone
are
extracted
the
bones
of
meats
that
are
cooked
in
water
therefore
are
in
a
sense
not
all
refuse
for
they
contain
some
food
which
may
be
secured
by
proper
cookery
it
is
true
of
course
that
the
bones
of
the
steaks
may
be
used
for
soup
making
and
that
the
nourishment
may
thus
be
utilized
but
this
must
be
done
by
a
separate
process
from
that
of
cooking
the
steak
itself
texture
and
flavor
of
meat
although
meats
vary
greatly
in
the
amount
of
fat
which
they
contain
and
to
a
much
less
degree
in
their
protein
content
the
chief
difference
to
be
noted
between
the
cheaper
and
more
expensive
cuts
is
not
so
much
in
their
nutritive
value
as
in
their
texture
and
flavor
all
muscle
consists
of
tiny
fibers
which
are
tender
in
young
animals
and
in
those
parts
of
older
animals
in
which
there
has
been
little
muscular
strain
under
the
backbone
in
the
hind
quarter
is
the
place
from
which
the
tenderest
meat
comes
this
is
usually
called
the
tenderloin
sometimes
in
beef
and
also
in
pork
it
is
taken
out
whole
and
sometimes
it
is
left
to
be
cut
up
with
the
rest
of
the
loin
in
old
animals
and
in
those
parts
of
the
body
where
there
has
been
much
muscular
action
the
neck
and
the
legs
for
example
the
muscle
fibers
are
tough
and
hard
but
there
is
another
point
which
is
of
even
greater
importance
than
this
the
fibers
of
all
muscle
are
bound
together
in
bundles
and
in
groups
of
bundles
by
a
thin
membrane
which
is
known
as
connective
tissue
this
membrane
if
heated
in
water
or
steam
is
converted
into
gelatin
the
process
goes
quickly
if
the
meat
is
young
and
tender
more
slowly
if
it
is
tough
connective
tissue
is
also
soluble
in
acetic
acid
that
acid
to
which
the
sourness
of
vinegar
is
due
for
this
reason
it
is
possible
to
make
meat
more
tender
by
soaking
it
in
vinegar
or
in
vinegar
and
water
the
proportions
of
the
two
depending
on
the
strength
of
the
vinegar
sour
beef
or
sauer
fleisch
as
it
is
known
to
germans
is
a
palatable
dish
of
this
sort
since
vinegar
is
a
preservative
this
suggests
a
method
by
which
a
surplus
of
beef
may
be
kept
for
several
days
and
then
converted
into
a
palatable
dish
flavor
in
meat
depends
mainly
on
certain
nitrogenous
substances
which
are
called
extractives
because
they
can
be
dissolved
out
or
extracted
by
soaking
the
meat
in
cold
water
the
quality
of
the
extractives
and
the
resulting
flavor
of
the
meat
vary
with
the
condition
of
the
animal
and
in
different
parts
of
its
body
they
are
usually
considered
better
developed
in
older
than
in
very
young
animals
many
persons
suppose
extractives
or
the
flavor
they
cause
are
best
in
the
most
expensive
cuts
of
meat
in
reality
cuts
on
the
side
of
beef
are
often
of
better
flavor
than
tender
cuts
but
owing
to
the
difficulty
of
mastication
this
fact
is
frequently
not
detected
the
extractives
have
little
or
no
nutritive
value
in
themselves
but
they
are
of
great
importance
in
causing
the
secretion
of
digestive
juices
at
the
proper
time
in
the
right
amount
and
of
the
right
chemical
character
it
is
this
quality
which
justifies
the
taking
of
soup
at
the
beginning
of
a
meal
and
the
giving
of
broths
meat
extracts
and
similar
preparations
to
invalids
and
weak
persons
these
foods
have
little
nutritive
material
in
themselves
but
they
are
great
aids
to
the
digestion
of
other
foods
the
amount
of
the
extractives
which
will
be
brought
out
into
the
water
when
meat
is
boiled
depends
upon
the
size
of
the
pieces
into
which
the
meat
is
cut
and
on
the
length
of
time
they
are
soaked
in
cold
water
before
being
heated
a
good
way
to
hinder
the
escape
of
the
flavoring
matter
is
to
sear
the
surface
of
the
meat
quickly
by
heating
it
in
fat
or
the
same
end
may
be
attained
by
plunging
it
into
boiling
water
such
solubility
is
taken
advantage
of
in
making
beef
tea
at
home
and
in
the
manufacture
of
meat
extract
the
extracted
material
being
finally
concentrated
by
evaporating
the
water
general
methods
of
cooking
meat
the
advantages
of
variety
in
the
methods
of
preparing
and
serving
are
to
be
considered
even
more
seriously
in
the
cooking
of
the
cheaper
cuts
than
in
the
cooking
of
the
more
expensive
ones
and
yet
even
in
this
connection
it
is
a
mistake
to
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
though
there
is
a
great
variety
of
dishes
the
processes
involved
are
few
in
number
an
experienced
teacher
of
cooking
a
woman
who
has
made
very
valuable
contributions
to
the
art
of
cookery
by
showing
that
most
of
the
numerous
processes
outlined
and
elaborately
described
in
the
cook
books
can
be
classified
under
a
very
few
heads
says
that
she
tries
to
reduce
the
cooking
of
meat
to
its
lowest
terms
and
teach
only
three
ways
of
cooking
the
first
is
the
application
of
intense
heat
to
keep
in
the
juices
this
is
suitable
only
for
portions
of
clear
meat
where
the
fibers
are
tender
by
the
second
method
the
meats
are
put
in
cold
water
and
cooked
at
a
low
temperature
this
is
suitable
for
bone
gristle
and
the
toughest
portions
of
the
meat
which
for
this
purpose
should
be
divided
into
small
bits
the
third
is
a
combination
of
these
two
processes
and
consists
of
searing
and
then
stewing
the
meat
this
is
suitable
for
halfway
cuts
those
that
are
neither
tender
nor
very
tough
the
many
varieties
of
meat
dishes
are
usually
only
a
matter
of
flavor
and
garnish
in
other
words
of
the
three
processes
the
first
is
the
short
method
it
aims
to
keep
all
the
juices
within
the
meat
the
second
is
a
very
long
method
employed
for
the
purpose
of
getting
all
or
most
of
the
juices
out
the
third
is
a
combination
of
the
two
not
so
long
as
the
second
and
yet
requiring
so
much
time
that
there
is
danger
of
the
meat
being
rendered
tasteless
unless
certain
precautions
are
taken
such
as
searing
in
hot
fat
or
plunging
into
boiling
water
there
is
a
wide
difference
between
exterior
and
interior
cuts
of
meat
with
respect
to
tenderness
induced
by
cooking
when
beef
flank
is
cooked
by
boiling
for
two
hours
the
toughness
of
the
fibers
greatly
increases
during
the
first
half
hour
of
the
cooking
period
and
then
diminishes
so
that
at
the
end
of
the
cooking
period
the
meat
is
found
to
be
in
about
the
same
condition
with
respect
to
toughness
or
tenderness
of
the
fibers
as
at
the
beginning
on
the
other
hand
in
case
of
the
tenderloin
there
is
a
decrease
in
toughness
of
the
fibers
throughout
the
cooking
period
which
is
particularly
marked
in
the
first
few
minutes
of
cooking
and
at
the
end
of
the
cooking
period
the
meat
fibers
are
only
half
as
tough
as
before
cooking

general
principles
of
cooking
texture
and
flavor
of
meat
general
methods
of
cooking
meat
economies
in
use
of
meat
a
good
idea
of
the
changes
which
take
place
while
meat
is
being
cooked
can
be
obtained
by
examining
a
piece
of
flesh
which
has
been
cooked
to
pieces
as
the
saying
goes
in
this
the
muscular
fibers
may
be
seen
completely
separated
one
from
another
showing
that
the
connective
tissue
has
been
destroyed
it
is
also
evident
that
the
fibers
themselves
are
of
different
texture
from
those
in
the
raw
meat
in
preparing
meat
for
the
table
it
is
usual
to
stop
short
of
the
point
of
disintegration
but
while
the
long
process
of
cooking
is
going
on
the
connective
tissue
is
gradually
softening
and
the
fibers
are
gradually
changing
in
texture
the
former
is
the
thing
to
be
especially
desired
but
the
latter
is
not
for
this
reason
it
is
necessary
to
keep
the
temperature
below
the
boiling
point
and
as
low
as
is
consistent
with
thorough
cooking
for
cooks
seem
agreed
as
the
result
of
experience
shows
that
slow
gentle
cooking
results
in
better
texture
than
is
the
case
when
meat
is
boiled
rapidly
this
is
the
philosophy
that
lies
back
of
the
simmering
process
losses
of
elements
vary
considerably
with
the
method
of
cooking
employed
being
of
course
greatest
where
small
pieces
of
meat
are
subjected
to
prolonged
cooking
the
chief
loss
in
weight
when
meat
is
cooked
is
due
to
the
driving
off
of
water
when
beef
is
cooked
by
pan
broiling
that
is
searing
in
a
hot
greased
pan
a
common
cooking
process
no
great
loss
of
nutrition
results
particularly
if
the
fat
and
other
substances
adhering
to
the
pan
are
utilized
in
the
preparation
of
gravy
when
beef
is
cooked
by
boiling
there
is
a
loss
of
to
per
cent
of
material
present
though
this
is
not
an
actual
loss
if
the
broth
is
utilized
for
soup
or
in
some
similar
way
even
in
the
case
of
meat
which
is
used
for
the
preparation
of
beef
tea
or
broth
the
losses
of
nutritive
material
are
apparently
small
though
much
of
the
flavoring
matter
has
been
removed
the
amount
of
fat
found
in
broth
varies
directly
with
the
amount
originally
present
in
the
meat
the
fatter
the
meat
the
greater
the
quantity
of
fat
in
the
broth
the
loss
of
water
in
cooking
varies
inversely
with
the
fatness
of
the
meat
that
is
the
fatter
the
meat
the
smaller
the
shrinkage
due
to
loss
of
water
in
cooked
meat
the
loss
of
various
constituents
is
inversely
proportional
to
the
size
of
the
cut
in
other
words
the
smaller
the
piece
of
meat
the
greater
the
percentage
of
loss
loss
also
appears
to
be
dependent
somewhat
upon
the
length
of
time
the
cooking
is
continued
when
pieces
of
meat
weighing
to
pounds
are
cooked
in
water
somewhat
under
the
boiling
point
there
appears
to
be
little
difference
in
the
amount
of
material
found
in
broth
whether
the
meat
is
placed
in
cold
water
or
hot
water
at
the
beginning
of
the
cooking
period
when
meat
is
roasted
in
the
oven
the
amount
of
material
removed
is
somewhat
affected
by
the
character
of
the
roasting
pan
and
similar
factors
thus
the
total
loss
in
weight
is
naturally
greater
in
an
open
than
in
a
closed
pan
as
the
open
pan
offers
more
opportunity
for
the
evaporation
of
water
judging
from
the
average
results
of
a
considerable
number
of
tests
it
appears
that
a
roast
weighing
pounds
raw
should
weigh
pounds
after
cooking
or
in
other
words
the
loss
is
about
of
the
original
weight
this
means
that
if
the
raw
meat
costs
cents
per
pound
the
cooked
would
represent
an
increase
of
cents
a
pound
on
the
original
cost
but
this
increase
would
of
course
be
lessened
if
all
the
drippings
and
gravy
are
utilized
economies
in
use
of
meat
the
expense
for
meat
in
the
home
may
be
reduced
in
several
ways
and
each
housekeeper
can
best
judge
which
to
use
in
her
own
case
from
a
careful
consideration
of
the
subject
it
appears
that
the
various
suggestions
which
have
been
made
on
the
subject
may
be
grouped
under
the
following
general
heads
economy
in
selection
and
purchase
so
as
to
take
advantage
of
varying
market
conditions
purchasing
meat
in
wholesale
quantities
for
home
use
serving
smaller
portions
of
meat
than
usual
or
using
meat
less
frequently
careful
attention
to
the
use
of
meat
bone
fat
and
small
portions
commonly
trimmed
off
and
thrown
away
and
the
utilization
of
portions
of
cooked
meat
and
the
use
of
the
less
expensive
kinds
the
choice
of
cuts
should
correspond
to
the
needs
of
the
family
and
the
preferences
of
its
members
careful
consideration
of
market
conditions
is
also
useful
not
only
to
make
sure
that
the
meat
is
handled
and
marketed
in
a
sanitary
way
but
also
to
take
advantage
of
any
favorable
change
in
price
which
may
be
due
for
instance
to
a
large
local
supply
of
some
particular
kind
or
cut
of
meat
in
towns
where
there
is
opportunity
for
choice
it
may
sometimes
be
found
more
satisfactory
not
to
give
all
the
family
trade
to
one
butcher
by
going
to
various
markets
before
buying
the
housekeeper
is
in
a
better
position
to
hear
of
variations
in
prices
and
so
be
in
a
position
to
get
the
best
values
ordering
by
telephone
or
from
the
butcher
boy
at
the
door
may
be
less
economical
than
going
to
market
in
person
as
the
range
of
choice
and
prices
is
of
course
more
obvious
when
the
purchaser
sees
the
goods
and
has
a
chance
to
observe
market
conditions
each
housekeeper
must
decide
for
herself
whether
or
not
the
greater
convenience
compensates
for
the
smaller
range
of
choice
which
such
ordering
from
description
entails
no
matter
what
the
cut
whether
expensive
or
cheap
it
can
not
be
utilized
to
the
best
advantage
unless
it
is
well
cooked
a
cheap
cut
of
meat
well
cooked
is
always
preferable
to
a
dear
one
spoiled
in
the
preparation
there
is
sometimes
an
advantage
in
using
canned
meat
and
meat
products
and
if
they
are
of
good
quality
such
products
are
wholesome
and
palatable
that
economy
is
furthered
by
careful
serving
at
table
is
obvious
if
more
meat
is
given
at
each
serving
than
the
person
wishes
or
habitually
eats
the
table
waste
is
unduly
increased
economy
in
all
such
points
is
important
and
not
beneath
the
dignity
of
the
family
in
many
american
families
meat
is
eaten
two
or
three
times
a
day
in
such
cases
the
simplest
way
of
reducing
the
meat
bill
would
very
likely
be
to
cut
down
the
amount
used
either
by
serving
it
less
often
or
by
using
less
at
a
time
deficiency
of
protein
need
not
be
feared
when
one
good
meat
dish
a
day
is
served
especially
if
such
nitrogenous
materials
as
eggs
milk
cheese
and
beans
are
used
instead
in
localities
where
fish
can
be
obtained
fresh
and
cheap
it
might
well
be
more
frequently
substituted
for
meat
for
the
sake
of
variety
as
well
as
economy
ingenious
cooks
have
many
ways
of
extending
the
flavor
of
meat
that
is
of
combining
a
small
quantity
with
other
materials
to
make
a
large
dish
as
in
meat
pies
stews
and
similar
dishes
by
buying
in
large
quantities
under
certain
conditions
it
may
be
possible
to
procure
meat
at
better
prices
than
those
which
ordinarily
prevail
in
the
retail
market
the
whole
side
or
quarter
of
an
animal
can
frequently
be
obtained
at
noticeably
less
cost
per
pound
than
when
it
is
bought
by
cut
and
can
be
used
to
advantage
when
the
housekeeper
understands
the
art
and
has
proper
storage
facilities
and
a
family
when
a
hind
quarter
of
mutton
for
example
comes
from
the
market
the
flank
on
which
the
meat
is
thin
and
as
good
housekeepers
believe
likely
to
spoil
more
easily
than
some
other
cuts
should
be
cooked
immediately
or
if
preferred
it
may
be
covered
with
a
thin
layer
of
fat
rendered
suet
which
can
be
easily
removed
when
the
time
for
cooking
comes
the
flank
together
with
the
rib
bone
ordinarily
makes
a
gallon
of
good
scotch
broth
the
remainder
of
the
hind
quarter
may
be
used
for
roast
or
chops
the
whole
pig
carcass
has
always
been
used
by
families
living
on
the
farms
where
the
animals
are
slaughtered
and
in
village
homes
town
housekeepers
not
infrequently
buy
pigs
whole
and
put
down
the
meat
an
animal
six
months
old
and
weighing
about
one
hundred
pounds
would
be
suitable
for
this
purpose
the
hams
and
thin
pieces
of
belly
meat
may
be
pickled
and
smoked
the
thick
pieces
of
belly
meat
packed
in
a
jar
and
covered
with
salt
or
brine
will
make
a
supply
of
fat
pork
to
cook
with
beans
and
other
vegetables
the
tenderloin
makes

roasts
the
head
and
feet
may
go
into

cheese
or
scrapple
and
the
trimmings
and
other
scraps
of
lean
meat
serve
for
a
few
pounds
of

in
some
large
families
it
is
found
profitable
to
corn
a
fore
quarter
of
beef
for
spring
and
summer
use
formerly
it
was
a
common
farm
practice
to
dry
beef
but
now
it
seems
to
be
more
usual
to
purchase
beef
which
has
been
dried
in
large
establishments
the
general
use
of
refrigerators
and
ice
chests
in
homes
at
the
present
time
has
had
a
great
influence
on
the
length
of
time
meat
may
be
kept
and
so
upon
the
amount
a
housewife
may
buy
at
a
time
with
advantage
in
the
percentage
of
fat
present
in
different
kinds
and
cuts
of
meat
a
greater
difference
exists
than
in
the
percentage
of
proteids
the
lowest
percentage
of
fat
is
per
cent
in
the
shank
of
beef
the
highest
is
per
cent
in
pork
chops
the
highest
priced
cuts
loin
and
ribs
of
beef
contain
to
per
cent
if
the
fat
of
the
meat
is
not
eaten
at
the
table
and
is
not
utilized
otherwise
a
pecuniary
loss
results
if
butter
is
the
fat
used
in
making
crusts
for
meat
pies
and
in
preparing
the
cheaper
cuts
there
is
little
economy
involved
the
fats
from
other
meat
should
therefore
be
saved
as
they
may
be
used
in
place
of
butter
in
such
cases
as
well
as
in
preparing
many
other
foods
the
fat
from
sausage
or
from
the
soup
kettle
or
from
a
pot
roast
which
is
savory
because
it
has
been
cooked
with
vegetables
is
particularly
acceptable
sometimes
savory
vegetables
onion
or
sweet
herbs
are
added
to
fat
when
it
is
tried
out
to
give
it
flavor
almost
any
meat
bones
can
be
used
in
soup
making
and
if
the
meat
is
not
all
removed
from
them
the
soup
is
better
but
some
bones
especially
the
rib
bones
if
they
have
a
little
meat
left
on
them
can
be
grilled
or
roasted
into
very
palatable
dishes
the
sparerib
of
southern
cooks
is
made
of
the
rib
bones
from
a
roast
of
pork
and
makes
a
favorite
dish
when
well
browned
the
braised
ribs
of
beef
often
served
in
restaurants
are
made
from
the
bones
cut
from
rib
roasts
in
this
connection
it
may
be
noted
that
many
of
the
dishes
popular
in
good
hotels
are
made
of
portions
of
meat
such
as
are
frequently
thrown
away
in
private
houses
but
which
with
proper
cooking
and
seasoning
make
attractive
dishes
and
give
most
acceptable
variety
to
the
menu
an
old
recipe
for
broiled
bones
directs
that
the
bone
beef
ribs
or
sirloin
bones
on
which
the
meat
is
not
left
too
thick
in
any
part
be
sprinkled
with
salt
and
pepper
cayenne
and
broiled
over
a
clear
fire
until
browned
another
example
of
the
use
of
bones
is
boiled
marrow
bone
the
bones
are
cut
in
convenient
lengths
the
ends
covered
with
a
little
piece
of
dough
over
which
a
floured
cloth
is
tied
and
cooked
in
boiling
water
for
two
hours
after
removing
the
cloth
and
dough
the
bones
are
placed
upright
on
toast
and
served
prepared
as
above
the
bones
may
also
be
baked
in
a
deep
dish
marrow
is
sometimes
removed
from
bones
after
cooking
seasoned
and
served
on
toast
trimmings
from
meat
may
be
utilized
in
various
made
dishes
or
they
can
always
be
put
to
good
use
in
the

in
such
ways

in
these
directions
a
spoonful
or
cupful
is
called
for
trying
out
fat
a
double
boiler
is
the
best
utensil
to
use
in
trying
out
small
portions
of
fat
there
is
no
danger
of
burning
the
fat
and
the
odor
is
much
less
noticeable
than
if
it
is
heated
in
a
dish
set
directly
over
the
fire
common
household
methods
of
extending
the
meat
flavor
through
a
considerable
quantity
of
material
which
would
otherwise
be
lacking
in
distinctive
taste
are
to
serve
the
meat
with
dumplings
generally
in
the
dish
with
it
to
combine
the
meat
with
crusts
as
in
meat
pies
or
meat
rolls
or
to
serve
the
meat
on
toast
and
biscuits
borders
of
rice
hominy
or

potatoes
are
examples
of
the
same
principles
applied
in
different
ways
by
serving
some
preparation
of
flour
rice
hominy
or
other
food
rich
in
starch
with
the
meat
we
get
a
dish
which
in
itself
approaches
nearer
to
the
balanced
ration
than
meat
alone
and
one
in
which
the
meat
flavor
is
extended
through

require
about
three
hours

if
this

in
the
fireless

the
mixture
must
be
reheated
when
the
vegetables
are
put
in
such
a
stew
may
also
be
made
of
mutton
if
veal
or
pork
is
used
the
vegetables
may
be
omitted
or
simply
a
little
onion
used
sometimes
for
variety
the
browning
of
the
meat
is
dispensed
with
when
white
meat
such
as
chicken

or
fresh

is
used
the

is
often
made

in
some
countries
it
is
customary
to
season
the
dumplings
themselves
with
herbs
or
to
stuff
them
with
bread
crumbs
fried
in
butter
instead
of
depending
upon
the
gravy
to
season
them
a
good
way
to
cook
dumplings
is
to
put
them
in
a
buttered
steamer
over
a
kettle
of
hot
water
they
should
cook
from
twelve
to
fifteen
minutes
if
it
is
necessary
to
cook
them
with
the
stew
enough
liquid
should
be
removed
so
that
they
may
be
placed
upon
the
meat
and
vegetables
sometimes
the
dough
is
baked
and
served
as
biscuits
over
which
the
stew
is
poured
if
the
stew
is
made
with
chicken
or
veal
it
is
generally
termed
a
fricassee
meat
pies
and
similar
dishes
meat
pies
represent
another
method
of
combining
flour
with
meat
they
are
ordinarily
baked
in
a
fairly
deep
dish
the
sides
of
which
may
or
may
not
be
lined
with
dough
the
cooked
meat
cut
into
small
pieces
is
put
into
the
dish
sometimes
with
small
pieces
of
vegetables
a
gravy
is
poured
over
the
meat
the
dish
is
covered
with
a
layer
of
dough
and
then
baked
most
commonly
the
dough
is
like
that
used
for
soda
or
biscuit
but
sometimes
shortened
pastry
dough
such
as
is
made
for
pies
is
used
this
is
especially
the
case
in
the
fancy
individual
dishes
usually
called
patties
occasionally
the
pie
is
covered
with
a
potato
crust
in
which
case
the
meat
is
put
directly
into
the
dish
without
lining
the
latter
stewed
beef
veal
and
chicken
are
probably
most
frequently
used
in
pies
but
any
kind
of
meat
may
be
used
or
several
kinds
in
combination
pork
pies
are
favorite
dishes
in
many
rural
regions
especially
at
time
and
when
well
made
are
excellent
if
pies
are
made
from
raw
meat
and
vegetables
longer
cooking
is
needed
than
otherwise
and
in
such
cases
it
is
well
to
cover
the
dish
with
a
plate
cook
until
the
pie
is
nearly
done
then
remove
the
plate
add
the
crust
and
return
to
the
oven
until
the
crust
is
lightly
browned
many
cooks
insist
on
piercing
holes
in
the
top
crust
of
a
meat
pie
directly
it
is
taken
from
the
oven
meat
and
tomato
pie
this
dish
presents
an
excellent
way
of
using
up
small
quantities
of
either
cold
beef
or
cold
mutton
if
fresh
tomatoes
are
used
peel
and
slice
them
if
canned
drain
off
the
liquid
place
a
layer
of
tomato
in
a
baking
dish
then
a
layer
of
sliced
meat
and
over
the
two
dredge
flour
pepper
and
salt
repeat
until
the
dish
is
nearly
full
then
put
in
an
extra
layer
of
tomato
and
cover
the
whole
with
a
layer
of
pastry
or
of
bread
or
cracker
crumbs
when
the
quantity
of
meat
is
small
it
may
be
helped
out
by
boiled
potatoes
or
other
suitable
vegetables
a
few
oysters
or
mushrooms
improve
the
flavor
especially
when
beef
is
used
the
pie
will
need
to
be
baked
from
half
an
hour
to
an
hour
according
to
its
size
and
the
heat
of
the
oven

pilaf
a
dish
very
common
in
the
orient
and
well
known
in
the
united
states
is
of
this
character
and
easily
made
when
there
is
soup
or
soup
stock
on

it
can
be
well
used
in
the
pilaf
turkish

or
broth
tablespoonfuls
of

the
rice
and
tomatoes
with
the
stock
in
a
double
boiler
until
the
rice
is
tender
removing
the
cover
after
the
rice
is
cooked
if
there
is
too
much
liquid
add
the
butter
and
stir
it
in
with
a
fork
to
prevent
the
rice
from
being
broken
a
little
catsup
or
chili
sauce
with
water
enough
to
make
of
a
cup
may
be
substituted
for
the
tomatoes
this
may
be
served
as
a
border
with
meat
or
served
separately
in
the
place
of
a
vegetable
or
may
make
the
main
dish
at
a
meal
as
it
is
savory
and
reasonably
nutritious
stew
from
cold
roast
this
dish
provides
a
good
way
of
using
up
the
remnants
of
a
roast
either
of
beef
or
mutton
the
meat
should
be
freed
from
fat
gristle
and
bones
cut
into
small
pieces
slightly
salted
and
put
into
a
kettle
with
water
enough
to
nearly
cover
it
it
should
simmer
until
almost
ready
to
break
in
pieces
when
onions
and
raw
potatoes
peeled
and
quartered
should
be
added
a
little
soup
stock
may
also
be
added
if
available
cook
until
the
potatoes
are
done
then
thicken
the
liquor
or
gravy
with
flour
the
stew
may
be
attractively
served
on
slices
of
crisp
toast
meat
with
beans
dry
beans
are
very
rich
in
protein
the
percentage
being
fully
as
large
as
that
in
meat
dry
beans
and
other
similar
legumes
are
usually
cooked
in
water
which
they
absorb
and
so
are
diluted
before
serving
on
the
other
hand
meats
by
the
ordinary
methods
of
cooking
are
usually
deprived
of
some
of
the
water
originally
present
facts
which
are
often
overlooked
in
discussing
the
matter
nevertheless
when
beans
are
served
with
meat
the
dish
is
almost
as
rich
in
protein
as
if
it
consisted
entirely
of
meat
pork
and
beans
is
such
a
dish
that
recipes
are
not
needed
some
cooks
use
a
piece
of
corned
mutton
or
a
piece
of
corned
beef
in
place
of
salt
or
corned
pork
or
bacon
or
use
butter
or
olive
oil
in
preparing
this
dish
in
the
southern
states
where
cowpeas
are
a
common
crop
they
are
cooked
in
the
same
way
as
dried
beans
cowpeas
baked
with
salt
pork
or
bacon
make
an
excellent
dish
resembling
pork
and
beans
but
of
distinctive
flavor
cowpeas
boiled
with
ham
or
with
bacon
are
also
and
palatable
dishes

may
be
used
in
making
this
dish
meat
salads
whether
meat
salads
are
economical
or
not
depends
upon
the
way
in
which
the
materials
are
utilized
if
in
chicken
salad
for
example
only
the
white
meat
of
chickens
especially
bought
for
the
purpose
and
only
the
inside
stems
of
expensive
celery
are
used
it
can
hardly
be
cheaper
than
plain
chicken
but
if
portions
of
meat
left
over
from
a
previous
serving
are
mixed
with
celery
grown
at
home
they
certainly
make
an
economical
dish
and
one
very
acceptable
to
most
persons
cold
roast
pork
or
tender
veal
in
fact
any
white
meat
can
be
utilized
in
the
same
way
apples
cut
into
cubes
may
be
substituted
for
part
of
the
celery
many
cooks
consider
that
with
the
apple
the
salad
takes
the
dressing
better
than
with
the
celery
alone
many
also
prefer
to
marinate
mix
with
a
little
oil
and
vinegar
the
meat
and
celery
or
celery
and
apples
before
putting
in
the
final
dressing
which
may
be
either
mayonnaise
or
a
good
boiled
dressing
meat
with
eggs
occasionally
eggs
are
combined
with
meat
making
very
nutritious
dishes
whether
this
is
an
economy
or
not
of
course
depends
on
the
comparative
cost
of
eggs
and
meat
in
general
it
may
be
said
that
eggs
are
cheaper
food
than
meat
when
a
dozen
costs
less
than
pounds
of
meat
for
a
dozen
eggs
weigh
about
pounds
and
the
proportions
of
protein
and
fat
which
they
contain
are
not
far
different
from
the
proportions
of
these
nutrients
in
the
average
cut
of
meat
when
eggs
are
cents
a
dozen
they
compare
favorably
with
a
round
of
beef
at
cents
a
pound
such
common
dishes
as
ham
and
eggs
bacon
or
salt
pork
and
eggs
and
omelette
with
minced
ham
or
other
meat
are
familiar
to
all
cooks
roast
beef
with
yorkshire
pudding
the
beef
is
roasted
as
usual
and
the
pudding
made
as
follows
eggs
pint
milk
cupful
flour
teaspoonful
salt
beat
the
eggs
until
very
light
then
add
the
milk
pour
the
mixture
over
the
flour
add
the
salt
and
beat
well
bake
in
hissing
hot
gem
pans
or
in
an
ordinary
baking
pan
for
minutes
and
baste
with
drippings
from
the
beef
if
gem
pans
are
used
they
should
be
placed
on
a
dripping
pan
to
protect
the
floor
of
the
oven
from
the
fat
many
cooks
prefer
to
bake
yorkshire
pudding
in
the
pan
with
the
meat
in
this
case
the
roast
should
be
placed
on
a
rack
and
the
pudding
batter
poured
on
the
pan
under
it
hash
with
poached
eggs
a
dish
popular
with
many
persons
is
hash
with
poached
eggs
on
top
of
the
hash
a
slice
of
toast
is
sometimes
used
under
the
hash
this
suggests
a
way
of
utilizing
the
small
amount
of
hash
which
would
otherwise
be
insufficient
for
a
meal
housekeepers
occasionally
use
up
odd
bits
of
other
meat
in
a
similar
way
chopping
and
seasoning
them
and
then
warming
and
serving
in
individual
baking
cups
with
a
poached
or
shirred
egg
on
each
stuffing
another
popular
way
to
extend
the
flavor
of
meat
over
a
large
amount
of
food
is
by
the
use
of
stuffing
as
it
is
impossible
to
introduce
much
stuffing
into
some
pieces
of
meat
even
if
the
meat
is
cut
to
make
a
pocket
for
it
it
is
often
well
to
prepare
more
than
can
be
put
into
the
meat
and
to
cook
the
remainder
in
the
pan
beside
the
meat
some
cooks
cover
the
extra
stuffing
with
buttered
paper
while
it
is
cooking
and
baste
it
at
intervals
mock
duck
mock
duck
is
made
by
placing
on
a
round
steak
a
stuffing
of
bread
crumbs
well
seasoned
with
chopped
onions
butter
chopped
suet
or
dripping
salt
pepper
and
a
little
sage
if
the
flavor
is
relished
the
steak
is
then
rolled
around
the
stuffing
and
tied
with
a
string
in
several
places
if
the
steak
seems
tough
the
roll
is
steamed
or
stewed
until
tender
before
roasting
in
the
oven
until
brown
or
it
may
be
cooked
in
a
casserole
or
other
covered
dish
in
which
case
a
cupful
or
more
of
water
or
should
be
poured
around
the
meat
mock
duck
is
excellent
served
with
currant
or
other
acid
jelly
veal
or
beef
birds
a
popular
dish
known
as
veal
or
beef
birds
or
by
a
variety
of
special
names
is
made
by
taking
small
pieces
of
meat
each
just
large
enough
for
an
individual
serving
and
preparing
them
in
the
same
way
as

meat
may
be
cooked
in

in
a
number
of
ways
without
being
allowed
to
reach
the
boiling
point
with
the
ordinary
kitchen
range
this
is
accomplished
by
cooking
on
the
cooler
part
of
the
stove
rather
than
on
the
hottest

the
above
names
are
given
to
dishes
made
from
the
less
tender
cuts
of
meat
they
vary
little
either
in
composition
or
method
of
preparation
in
all
cases
the
meat
is
browned
on
the
outside
to
increase
the
flavor
and
then
cooked
in
a
small
amount
of
water
in
a
closely
covered
kettle
or
other
receptacle
until
tender
the
flavor
of
the
dish
is
secured
by
browning
the
meat
and
by
the
addition
of
the
seasoning
vegetables
many
recipes
suggest
that
the
vegetables
be
removed
before
serving
and
the
liquid
be
thickened
as
the
vegetables
are
usually
extremely
well
seasoned
by
means
of
the
brown
fat
and
the
extracts
of
the
meat
it
seems
unfortunate
not
to
serve
them
of
course
the
kind
quality
and
shape
of
the
meat
all
play
their
part
in
the
matter
extra
time
is
needed
for
meats
with
a
good
deal
of
sinew
and
tough
fibers
such
as
the
tough
steaks
shank
cuts
etc
and
naturally
a
fillet
of
beef
or
a
steak
from
a
prime
cut
will
take
less
time
than
a
thick
piece
from
the
shin
such
dishes
require
more
time
and
perhaps
more
skill
in
their
preparation
and
may
involve
more
expense
for
fuel
than
the
more
costly
cuts
which
like
chops
or
tender
steaks
may
be
quickly
cooked

is
out

few
who
know
anything
of

go
astray
chopped
meat
also
may
be
cooked
in
a
casserole
and
this
utensil
is
particularly
useful
for
the
purpose
because
the
food
is
served
in
the
same
dish
in
which
it
is
cooked
and
may
easily
be
kept
hot

but
in
which
vinegar
is
used
to
give

as
well
as
to
soften

meat
and
make

are
the
following
sour

in

and
water
and
then
cooked
in
a

or
in
some
similar
way
pounded
meat
pounding
meat
before
cooking
is
an
method
of
making
it
tender
but
while
it
has
the
advantage
of
breaking
down
the
tough
tissues
it
has
the
disadvantage
of
being
likely
to
drive
out
the
juices
and
with
them
the
flavor
a
very
good
way
of
escaping
this
difficulty
is
pounding
flour
into
the
meat
this
catches
and
retains
the
juices
below
are
given
the
recipes
for
two
palatable
dishes
in
which
this
is
done
farmer
stew
pound
flour
into
both
sides
of
a
round
steak
using
as
much
as
the
meat
will
take
up
this
may
be
done
with
a
meat
pounder
or
with
the
edge
of
a
heavy
plate
fry
in
drippings
butter
or
other
fat
in
a
scotch
bowl
or
if
more
convenient
in
an
ordinary
iron
kettle
or
a
frying
pan
then
add
water
enough
to
cover
it
cover
the
dish
very
tightly
so
that
the
steam
can
not
escape
and
allow
the
meat
to
simmer
for
two
hours
or
until
it
is
tender
one
advantage
of
this
dish
is
that
ordinarily
it
is
ready
to
serve
when
the
meat
is
done
as
the
gravy
is
already
thickened
however
if
a
large
amount
of
fat
is
used
in
the
frying
the
gravy
may
not
be
thick
enough
and
must
be
blended
with
flour

two
hours
basting
occasionally
chopped
meat
chopping
meat
is
one
of
the
principal
methods
of
making
tough
and
inexpensive
meat
tender
dividing
it
finely
and
thus
cutting
the
connective
tissue
into
small
bits
such
meats
have
another
advantage
in
that
they
may
be
cooked
quickly
and
economically
chopped
raw
meat
of
almost
any
kind
can
be
very
quickly
made
into
a
savory
dish
by
cooking
it
with
water
or
with
water
and
milk
for
a
short
time
then
thickening
with
butter
and
flour
and
adding
different
seasonings
as
relished
either
pepper
and
salt
alone
or
onion
juice
celery
or
tomato
such
a
dish
may
be
made
to
go
further
by
serving
it
on
toast
or
with
a
border
of
rice
or
in
some
similar
combination
savory
rolls
savory
rolls
in
great
variety
are
made
out
of
chopped
meat
either
with
or
without
egg
the
variety
is
secured
by
the
flavoring
materials
used
and
by
the
sauces
with
which
the
baked
rolls
are
served
a
few
recipes
will
be
given
below
while
these
definite
directions
are
given
it
should
be
remembered
that
a
few
general
principles
borne
in
mind
make
recipes
unnecessary
and
make
it
possible
to
utilize
whatever
may
happen
to
be
on
hand
appetizing
rolls
are
made
with
beef
and
pork
mixed
the
proportion
varies
from
two
parts
of
beef
and
one
of
pork
to
two
of
pork
and
one
of
beef
the
rolls
are
always
improved
by
laying
thin
slices
of
salt
pork
or
bacon
over
them
which
keep
the
surface
moistened
with
fat
during
the
roasting
these
slices
should
be
scored
on
the
edge
so
that
they
will
not
curl
up
in
cooking
the
necessity
for
the
salt
pork
is
greater
when
the
chopped
meat
is
chiefly
beef
than
when
it
is
largely
pork
or
veal
bread
crumbs
or
bread
moistened
in
water
can
always
be
added
as
it
helps
to
make
the
dish
go
farther
when
onions
green
peppers
or
other
vegetables
are
used
they
should
always
be
thoroughly
cooked
in
fat
before
being
put
in
the
roll
for
usually
they
do
not
cook
sufficiently
in
the
length
of
time
it
takes
to
cook
the
meat
sausage
makes
a
good
addition
to
the
roll
but
it
is
usually
cheaper
to
use
unseasoned
pork
meat
with
the
addition
of
a
little
sage
developing
flavor
of
meat
the
typical
meat
flavors
are
very
palatable
to
most
persons
even
when
they
are
constantly
tasted
and
consequently
the
better
cuts
of
meat
in
which
they
are
well
developed
can
be
cooked
and
served
without
attention
being
paid
especially
to
flavor
careful
cooking
aids
in
developing
the
natural
flavor
of
some
of
the
cheaper
cuts
and
such
a
result
is
to
be
sought
wherever
it
is
possible
browning
also
brings
out
flavors
agreeable
to
most
palates
aside
from
these
two
ways
of
increasing
the
flavor
of
the
meat
itself
there
are
countless
ways
of
adding
flavor
to
otherwise
rather
tasteless
meats
the
flavors
may
be
added
in
preparing
the
meat
for
cooking
as
in
various
seasoned
dishes
already
described
or
they
may
be
supplied
to
cook
meat
in
the
form
of
sauces
retaining
natural
flavor
as
has
already
been
pointed
out
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
retain
the
extractives
in
a
piece
of
meat
so
tough
as
to
require
prolonged
cooking
it
is
sometimes
partially
accomplished
by
first
searing
the
exterior
of
the
meat
and
thus
preventing
the
escape
of
the
juices
another
device
illustrated
by
the
following
recipe
is
to
let
them
escape
into
the
gravy
which
is
served
with
the
meat
itself
a
similar
principle
is
applied
when
roasts
are
basted
with
their
own
juice
round
steak
on
biscuits
cut
round
steak
into
pieces
about
inch
square
cover
with
water
and
cook
it
at
a
temperature
just
below
the
boiling
point
until
it
is
tender
or
boil
for
five
minutes
and
while
still
hot
put
into
the
fireless
cooker
and
leave
it
for
five
hours
thicken
the
gravy
with
flour
mixed
with
water
allowing
two
level
tablespoonfuls
to
a
cup
of
water
pour
the
meat
and
gravy
over
split
biscuits
so
baked
that
they
have
a
large
amount
of
crust
flavor
of
browned
meat
or
fat
next
to
the
unchanged
flavor
of
the
meat
itself
comes
the
flavor
which
is
secured
by
browning
the
meat
with
fat
the
outside
slices
of
roast
meat
have
this
browned
flavor
in
marked
degree
except
in
the
case
of
roasts
browning
for
flavor
is
usually
accomplished
by
heating
the
meat
in
a
frying
pan
in
fat
which
has
been
tried
out
of
pork
or
in
suet
or
butter
care
should
be
taken
that
the
fat
is
not
scorched
the
chief
reason
for
the
bad
opinion
in
which
fried
food
is
held
by
many
is
that
it
almost
always
means
eating
burned
fat
when
fat
is
heated
too
high
it
splits
up
into
fatty
acids
and
glycerin
and
from
the
glycerin
is
formed
a
substance
acrolein
which
has
a
very
irritating
effect
upon
the
mucous
membrane
all
will
recall
that
the
fumes
of
scorched
fat
make
the
eyes
water
it
is
not
surprising
that
such
a
substance
if
taken
into
the
stomach
should
cause
digestive
disturbance
fat
in
itself
is
a
very
valuable
food
and
the
objection
to
fried
foods
because
they
may
be
fat
seems
illogical
if
they
supply
burned
fat
there
is
a
good
reason
for
suspicion
many
housekeepers
cook
bacon
in
the
oven
on
a
wire
broiler
over
a
pan
and
believe
it
more
wholesome
than
fried
bacon
the
reason
of
course
is
that
thus
cooked
in
the
oven
there
is
less
chance
for
the
bacon
becoming
impregnated
with
burned
fat
where
fried
salt
pork
is
much
used
good
cooks
know
that
it
must
not
be
cooked
over
a
very
hot
fire
even
if
they
have
never
heard
of
the
chemistry
of
burned
fat
the
recipe
for
roast
and
other
similar
recipes
may
be
varied
by
browning
the
meat
or
part
of
it
before
covering
with
water
this
results
in
keeping
some
of
the
natural
flavoring
within
the
meat
itself
and
allowing
less
to
go
into
the
gravy
the
flavor
of
veal
can
be
very
greatly
improved
in
this
way
the
following
dishes
made
with
pork
owe
their
savoriness
chiefly
to
the
flavor
of
browned
fat
or

salt

with
milk

minutes

rind
of
the

and

until
they
are
a
golden
brown
make
a
milk
gravy
by
heating
flour
in
the
fat
that

been
tried
out
allowing
two
tablespoonfuls
of
fat
and
two
tablespoonfuls
of
flour
to
each
cup
of
milk
this
is
a
good
way
to
use
skim
milk
which
is
as
rich
in
protein
as
whole
milk
the
pork
and
milk
gravy
served
with
boiled
or
baked
potatoes
makes
a
cheap
and
simple
meal
but
one
that
most
people
like
very
much
bacon
is
often
used
in

of
salt

the
art
of
preparing
savory
gravies
and
sauces
is
more
important
in
connection
with
the
serving
of
the
cheaper
meats
than
in
connection
with
the
cooking
of
the
more
expensive
there
are
a
few
general
principles
underlying
the
making
of
all
sauces
or
gravies
whether
the
liquid
used
is
water
milk
stock
tomato
juice
or
some
combination
of
these
for
ordinary
gravy
level
tablespoonfuls
of
flour
or
tablespoonfuls
of
cornstarch
or
arrow
root
is
sufficient
to
thicken
a
cupful
of
liquid
this
is
true
excepting
when
as
in
the
recipe
on
page
the
flour
is
browned
in
this
case
about
tablespoonful
more
should
be
allowed
for
browned
flour
does
not
thicken
so
well
as
unbrowned
the
fat
used
may
be
butter
or
the
drippings
from
the
meat
the
allowance
being
tablespoonfuls
to
a
cup
of
liquid
the
easiest
way
to
mix
the
ingredients
is
to
heat
the
fat
add
the
flour
and
cook
until
the
mixture
ceases
to
bubble
and
then
to
add
the
liquid
this
is
a
quick
method
and
by
using
it
there
is
little
danger
of
getting
a
lumpy
gravy
many
persons
however
think
it
is
not
a
wholesome
method
and
prefer
the
one
of
thickening
the
gravy
by
means
of
flour
mixed
with
a
little
cold
water
the
latter
method
is
of
course
not
practicable
for
brown
gravies
the
good
flavor
of
browned
flour
is
often
overlooked
if
flour
is
cooked
in
fat
until
it
is
a
dark
brown
color
a
distinctive
and
very
agreeable
flavor
is
obtained
this
flavor
combines
very
well
with
that
of
currant
jelly
and
a
little
jelly
added
to
a
brown
gravy
is
a
great
improvement
the
flavor
of
this
should
not
be
combined
with
that
of
onions
or
other
highly
flavored
vegetables

being
taken
that
this
rubbing
is
quite
even

the

must
be
washed
off
with

that
not

done
at
