alfred
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
characters
in
all
history
for
those
blended
virtues
and
talents
which
remind
us
of
a
david
a
marcus
aurelius
or
a
saint
louis
a
man
whom
everybody
loved
whose
deeds
were
a
boon
whose
graces
were
a
radiance
and
whose
words
were
a
benediction
alike
a
saint
a
poet
a
warrior
and
a
statesman
he
ruled
a
little
kingdom
but
left
a
great
name
second
only
to
charlemagne
among
the
civilizers
of
his
people
and
nation
in
the
middle
ages
as
a
man
of
military
genius
he
yields
to
many
of
the
kings
of
england
to
say
nothing
of
the
heroes
of
ancient
and
modern
times
when
he
was
born
the
saxons
had
occupied
britain
or
england
about
four
hundred
years
having
conquered
it
from
the
old
celtic
inhabitants
soon
after
the
romans
had
retired
to
defend
their
own
imperial
capital
from
the
goths
like
the
goths
vandals
franks
burgundians
lombards
and
heruli
the
saxons
belonged
to
the
same
teutonic
race
whose
remotest
origin
can
be
traced
to
central
asia
kindred
indeed
to
the
early
inhabitants
of
italy
and
greece
whom
we
call
or
aryan
these
saxons
one
of
the
fiercest
tribes
of
the
teutonic
barbarians
lived
before
the
invasion
of
britain
in
that
part
of
europe
which
we
now
call
schleswig
in
the
heart
of
the
peninsula
which
parts
the
baltic
from
the
northern
seas
also
in
those
parts
of
germany
which
now
belong
to
hanover
and
oldenburg
it
does
not
appear
from
the
best
authorities
that
these
tribes
called
engle
saxon
and
jute
wandered
about
seeking
a
precarious
living
but
they
were
settled
in
villages
in
the
government
of
which
we
trace
the
germs
of
the
subsequent
social
and
political
institutions
of
england
the
social
centre
was
the
homestead
of
the
or
distinguished
from
his
by
his
greater
wealth
and
nobler
blood
and
held
by
them
in
hereditary
reverence
from
him
and
his
the
leaders
of
a
warlike
expedition
were
chosen
he
alone
was
armed
with
spear
and
sword
and
his
long
hair
floated
in
the
wind
he
was
bound
to
protect
his
kinsmen
from
wrong
and
injustice
the
land
which
inclosed
the
village
whether
reserved
for
pasture
wood
or
tillage
was
undivided
and
every
free
villager
had
the
right
of
turning
his
cattle
and
swine
upon
it
and
also
of
sharing
in
the
division
of
the
harvest
the
basis
of
the
life
was
agricultural
our
saxon
ancestors
in
germany
did
not
subsist
exclusively
by
hunting
or
fishing
although
these
pursuits
were
not
neglected
they
were
as
skilful
with
the
plough
and
mattock
as
they
were
in
steering
a
boat
or
hunting
a
deer
or
pursuing
a
whale
they
were
coarse
in
their
pleasures
but
religious
in
their
turn
of
mind
pagans
indeed
but
worshipping
the
powers
of
nature
with
poetic
ardor
they
were
born
warriors
and
their
passion
for
the
sea
led
to
adventurous
enterprise
before
the
close
of
the
third
century
their
boats
driven
by
fifty
oars
had
been
seen
in
the
british
waters
and
after
the
romans
had
left
the
britons
to
defend
themselves
against
the
scots
and
picts
the
harassed
rulers
of
the
land
invoked
the
aid
of
these
saxon
pirates
and
headed
by
two
ealdormen
hengist
and
horsa
they
landed
on
the
isle
of
thanet
in
the
year
these
two
chieftains
are
the
earliest
traditionary
heroes
of
the
saxons
in
england
their
mercenary
work
was
soon
done
and
after
it
was
done
they
had
no
idea
of
retiring
to
their
own
villages
in
germany
they
cast
their
greedy
eyes
on
richer
pastures
and
more
fruitful
fields
flocked
from
the
elbe
and
rhine
to
their
settlement
in
thanet
in
years
after
hengist
and
horsa
landed
cerdic
with
a
more
formidable
band
had
taken
possession
of
a
large
part
of
the
southern
coast
and
pushed
his
way
to
winchester
and
founded
the
kingdom
of
wessex
but
the
work
of
conquest
was
slow
it
took
seventy
years
for
the
saxons
to
become
masters
of
kent
sussex
hampshire
essex
and
wessex
a
stout
resistance
to
the
invading
saxons
had
been
made
by
the
native
britons
headed
by
arthur
a
legendary
hero
who
is
thought
to
have
lived
near
the
close
of
the
fifth
century
his
deeds
and
those
of
the
knights
of
the
round
table
form
the
subject
of
one
of
the
most
interesting
romances
of
the
middle
ages
probably
written
in
the
brightest
age
of
chivalry
and
by
a
monk
very
ignorant
of
history
since
he
gives
many
norman
names
to
his
characters
but
all
the
valor
of
the
celtic
hero
and
his
chivalrous
followers
was
of
no
avail
before
the
fierce
and
persistent
attacks
of
a
hardier
race
bent
on
the
possession
of
a
fairer
land
than
their
own
we
know
but
little
of
the
details
of
the
various
conflicts
until
britain
was
finally
won
by
these
predatory
tribes
of
barbarians
the
stubborn
resistance
of
the
britons
led
to
their
final
retreat
or
complete
extermination
and
with
their
disappearance
also
perished
what
remained
of
the
roman
civilization
the
resistance
of
the
britons
was
much
more
obstinate
than
that
of
any
of
the
other
provinces
of
the
empire
but
as
the
forces
arrayed
against
them
were
comparatively
small
the
work
of
conquest
was
slow
it
took
thirty
years
to
win
kent
alone
and
sixty
to
complete
the
conquest
of
south
britain
and
nearly
two
hundred
to
subdue
the
whole
island
but
when
the
conquest
was
made
it
was
complete
and
england
was
saxon
in
language
in
institutions
and
in
manners
while
france
retained
much
of
the
language
habits
and
institutions
of
the
romans
and
even
of
the
old
gaulish
elements
of
society
england
became
a
german
nation
on
the
complete
wreck
of
everything
roman
whose
peculiar
characteristic
was
the
freedom
of
those
who
tilled
the
land
or
gathered
around
the
military
standard
of
their
chieftains
it
was
the
gradual
transfer
of
a
whole
german
nation
from
the
elbe
and
rhine
to
the
thames
and
the
humber
with
their
original
village
institutions
under
the
rule
of
their
with
the
simple
addition
of
kings
unknown
in
their
original
settlements
but
brought
about
by
the
necessities
which
military
life
and
conquest
produced
after
the
conquest
we
find
seven
petty
kings
who
ruled
in
different
parts
of
the
island
jealousies
wars
and
marriages
soon
reduced
their
number
to
three
ruling
over
wessex
mercia
and
northumbria
all
the
people
of
these
kingdoms
were
pagan
the
chief
deity
of
whom
was
woden
it
was
not
till
the
middle
of
the
seventh
century
that
christianity
was
introduced
into
wessex
although
kent
and
northumbria
received
christian
missionaries
earlier
the
beautiful
though
tradition
of
the
incidents
which
led
to
the
introduction
of
the
christian
religion
deserves
a
passing
mention
about
the
middle
of
the
sixth
century
some
saxons
taken
in
war
in
one
of
the
quarrels
of
rival
kings
and
hence
made
slaves
were
exposed
for
sale
in
rome
gregory
the
great
then
simply
deacon
passing
by
the
observed
their
fair
faces
white
bodies
blue
eyes
and
golden
hair
and
inquired
of
the
who
they
were
they
are
english
or
angles
no
not
angles
said
the
pious
and
poetic
deacon
they
are
angels
with
faces
so
angelic
from
what
country
did
they
come
from
deira
ira
ay
plucked
from
god
wrath
what
is
the
name
of
their
king
ella
ay
let
alleluia
be
sung
in
their
land
it
need
scarcely
be
added
that
when
this
pious
and
witty
deacon
became
pope
he
remembered
these
saxon
slaves
and
sent
augustin
or
austin
not
to
be
confounded
with
augustine
of
hippo
who
lived
nearly
two
centuries
earlier
with
forty
monks
as
missionaries
to
convert
the
pagan
saxons
they
established
themselves
in
kent
which
became
the
seat
of
the
first
english
bishopric
through
the
favor
of
the
king
aethelbert
whose
wife
clotilda
a
french
princess
had
been
previously
converted
soon
after
essex
followed
the
example
of
kent
and
then
northumbria
wessex
was
the
last
of
the
saxon
kingdoms
to
be
converted
their
inhabitants
being
especially
fierce
and
warlike
it
is
singular
that
no
traces
of
christianity
seem
to
have
been
left
in
britain
on
the
completion
of
the
saxon
conquest
although
it
had
been
planted
there
as
early
as
the
time
of
constantine
helena
was
a
christian
and
pelagius
and
celestine
were
british
monks
but
the
saxon
conquest
eradicated
all
that
was
left
of
roman
influence
and
institutions
when
christianity
had
once
acquired
a
foothold
among
the
saxons
its
progress
was
rapid
in
no
country
were
monastic
institutions
more
firmly
planted
monasteries
and
churches
were
erected
in
the
principal
settlements
and
liberally
endowed
by
the
saxon
kings
in
kent
were
the
great
sees
of
canterbury
and
rochester
in
essex
was
london
in
east
anglia
was
norwich
in
wessex
was
winchester
in
mercia
were
lichfield
leicester
worcester
and
hereford
in
northumbria
were
york
durham
and
ripon
each
cathedral
had
its
schools
and
convents
christianity
became
the
law
of
the
land
and
entered
largely
into
all
the
saxon
codes
there
was
a
constant
immigration
of
missionaries
into
britain
and
the
great
sees
were
filled
with
distinguished
ecclesiastics
frequently
from
the
continent
since
a
strong
union
was
cemented
between
rome
and
the
english
churches
prince
and
prelate
made
frequent
pilgrimages
to
the
old
capital
of
the
world
and
were
received
with
distinguished
honors
the
monasteries
were
filled
with
princes
and
nobles
and
ladies
of
rank
as
early
as
the
eighth
century
monasteries
were
enormously
multiplied
and
enriched
for
the
piety
of
the
saxons
assumed
a
monastic
type
what
civilization
existed
can
be
traced
chiefly
to
the
church
we
read
of
only
three
great
names
among
the
saxons
who
impressed
their
genius
on
the
nation
until
the
various
saxon
kingdoms
were
united
under
the
sovereignty
of
ecgberht
or
egbert
king
of
wessex
about
the
middle
of
the
ninth
century
these
were
theodore
caedmon
and
baeda
the
first
was
a
monk
from
tarsus
whom
the
pope
dispatched
in
the
year
to
britain
as
archbishop
of
canterbury
to
him
the
work
of
church
organization
was
intrusted
he
enlarged
the
number
of
the
sees
and
arranged
them
on
the
basis
which
was
maintained
for
a
thousand
years
the
subordination
of
priest
to
bishop
and
bishop
to
primate
was
more
clearly
defined
by
him
he
also
assembled
councils
for
general
legislation
which
perhaps
led
the
way
to
national
parliaments
he
not
only
organized
the
episcopate
but
the
parish
system
and
even
the
system
of
tithes
has
been
by
some
attributed
to
him
the
missionary
who
had
been
merely
the
chaplain
of
a
nobleman
became
the
priest
of
the
manor
or
parish
the
second
memorable
man
was
born
a
cowherd
encouraged
to
sing
his
songs
by
the
abbess
hilda
a
northumbrian
deborah
when
advanced
in
life
he
entered
through
her
patronage
a
convent
and
sang
the
marvellous
and
touching
stories
of
the
hebrew
scriptures
fixing
their
truths
on
the
mind
of
the
nation
and
becoming
the
father
of
english
poetry
the
third
of
these
great
men
was
the
greatest
baeda
or
bede
as
the
name
is
usually
spelled
he
was
a
priest
of
the
great
abbey
church
of
weremouth
in
northumbria
and
was
a
master
of
all
the
learning
then
known
he
was
the
life
of
the
famous
school
of
jarrow
and
it
is
said
that
six
hundred
monks
besides
strangers
listened
to
his
teachings
his
greatest
work
was
an
ecclesiastical
history
of
the
english
nation
which
extends
from
the
landing
of
julius
caesar
to
the
year
he
was
the
first
english
historian
and
the
founder
of
mediaeval
history
and
all
we
know
of
the
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
after
the
landing
of
augustin
the
missionary
is
drawn
from
him
he
was
not
only
historian
but
theologian
the
father
of
the
education
of
the
english
nation
it
was
one
hundred
and
fourteen
years
after
the
death
of
the
venerable
bede
before
alfred
was
born
the
youngest
son
of
aethelwulf
king
of
wessex
who
united
under
his
rule
all
the
saxon
kingdoms
the
mother
of
alfred
was
osburgha
a
german
princess
of
extraordinary
force
of
character
from
her
he
received
at
the
age
of
four
the
first
rudiments
of
education
and
learned
to
sing
those
saxon
ballads
which
he
afterwards
recited
with
so
much
effect
in
the
danish
camp
at
the
age
of
five
alfred
was
sent
to
rome
probably
to
be
educated
where
he
remained
two
years
visiting
on
his
return
the
court
of
charles
the
bald
the
centre
of
culture
in
western
europe
the
celebrated
hincmar
archbishop
of
rheims
the
greatest
churchman
of
the
age
was
the
most
influential
minister
of
the
king
at
whose
table
also
sat
john
erigena
then
engaged
in
a
controversy
with
gotteschalk
the
german
monk
about
the
presence
of
christ
in
the
eucharist
the
earliest
notable
theological
controversy
after
the
patristic
age
alfred
was
too
young
to
take
an
interest
in
this
profound
discussion
but
he
may
perhaps
have
received
an
intellectual
impulse
from
his
visit
to
rome
and
paris
which
affected
his
whole
subsequent
life
about
this
time
his
father
over
sixty
years
of
age
married
a
french
princess
of
the
name
of
judith
only
fourteen
years
of
age
even
in
that
rude
age
a
great
scandal
which
nearly
resulted
in
his
dethronement
he
lived
but
two
years
longer
and
his
youthful
widow
to
the
still
greater
scandal
of
the
realm
and
church
married
her
late
husband
eldest
son
ethelbald
who
inherited
the
crown
it
was
through
this
woman
and
her
subsequent
husband
baldwin
called
de
count
of
flanders
that
the
english
kings
since
the
conqueror
trace
their
descent
from
alfred
and
charlemagne
for
her
son
the
second
count
of
flanders
married
elfrida
the
daughter
of
alfred
from
this
union
descended
the
conqueror
wife
matilda
thus
the
present
royal
family
of
england
can
trace
a
direct
descent
through
william
the
conqueror
alfred
and
charlemagne
and
is
allied
by
blood
remotely
indeed
with
most
of
the
reigning
princes
of
europe
the
three
elder
brothers
of
alfred
reigned
successively
over
wessex
to
whom
all
england
owned
allegiance
it
was
during
their
short
reigns
that
the
great
invasion
of
the
danes
took
place
which
reduced
the
whole
island
to
desolation
and
misery
these
danes
were
of
the
same
stock
as
the
saxons
but
more
enterprising
and
bold
it
seems
that
they
drove
the
saxons
before
them
as
the
saxons
three
hundred
years
before
had
driven
the
britons
in
their
destructive
ravages
they
sacked
and
burned
croyland
peterborough
huntington
ely
and
other
wealthy
abbeys
the
glory
of
the
kingdom
together
with
their
valuable
libraries
it
was
then
that
alfred
already
the
king
most
capable
general
began
his
reign
at
the
age
of
on
the
death
of
his
brother
ethelred
a
brave
and
pious
prince
mortally
wounded
at
the
battle
of
merton
it
was
alfred
memorable
struggle
with
the
danes
which
gave
to
him
his
military
fame
when
he
ascended
the
throne
these
barbarians
had
gained
a
foothold
and
in
a
few
years
nearly
the
whole
of
england
was
in
their
hands
wave
followed
wave
in
the
dreadful
invasion
fleet
after
fleet
and
army
after
army
was
destroyed
and
the
saxons
were
driven
nearly
to
despair
for
added
to
the
evils
of
pillage
and
destruction
were
pestilence
and
famine
the
usual
attendants
of
desolating
wars
in
the
year
the
heroic
leader
of
the
disheartened
people
was
compelled
to
hide
himself
with
a
few
faithful
followers
in
the
forest
of
selwood
amid
the
marshes
of
somersetshire
yet
alfred
a
fugitive
succeeded
at
last
in
rescuing
his
kingdom
of
wessex
from
the
dominion
of
pagan
barbarians
and
restoring
it
to
a
higher
state
of
prosperity
than
it
had
ever
attained
before
he
preserved
both
christianity
and
civilization
for
these
exalted
services
he
is
called
the
great
and
no
prince
ever
more
heroically
earned
the
title
it
is
hard
says
hughes
who
has
written
an
interesting
but
not
exhaustive
life
of
alfred
to
account
for
the
sudden
and
complete
collapse
of
the
west
saxon
power
in
january
since
in
the
campaign
of
the
preceding
year
alfred
had
been
successful
both
by
sea
and
land
yet
such
seems
to
have
been
the
fact
whatever
may
be
its
explanation
no
such
panic
had
ever
overcome
the
britons
who
made
a
more
stubborn
resistance
no
prince
ever
suffered
a
severer
humiliation
than
did
the
saxon
monarch
during
the
dreary
winter
of
but
according
to
asser
it
was
for
his
ultimate
good
alfred
was
deeply
and
sincerely
religious
and
like
david
saw
the
hand
of
god
in
all
his
misfortunes
in
his
case
adversity
proved
the
school
of
greatness
for
six
months
he
was
hidden
from
public
view
lost
sight
of
entirely
by
his
afflicted
subjects
enduring
great
privations
and
gaining
a
scanty
subsistence
there
are
several
popular
legends
about
his
life
in
the
marshes
too
well
known
to
be
described
one
about
the
cakes
and
another
about
his
wanderings
to
the
danish
camp
disguised
as
a
minstrel
both
probable
enough
yet
if
true
they
show
an
extraordinary
depth
of
misfortunes
at
last
his
subjects
began
to
rally
it
was
known
by
many
that
alfred
was
alive
bodies
of
armed
followers
gradually
gathered
at
his
retreat
he
was
strongly
intrenched
and
occasionally
he
issued
from
his
retreat
to
attack
straggling
bands
or
to
make
reconnoissance
of
the
forces
in
may
he
left
his
fortified
position
and
met
some
brave
and
faithful
subjects
at
egbert
stone
twenty
miles
to
the
east
of
selwood
the
gathering
had
been
carefully
planned
and
secretly
made
and
was
unknown
to
the
danes
his
first
marked
success
was
at
edington
or
ethandune
where
the
pagan
host
lay
encamped
near
westbury
we
have
no
definite
knowledge
of
the
number
of
men
engaged
in
that
bloody
and
desperate
battle
in
which
the
saxons
were
greatly
outnumbered
by
the
danes
who
were
marshalled
under
a
chieftain
called
guthrun
but
the
battle
was
decisive
and
made
alfred
once
more
master
of
england
south
of
the
thames
guthrun
now
in
alfred
power
was
the
ablest
warrior
that
the
northmen
had
as
yet
produced
he
was
shut
up
in
an
inland
fort
with
no
ships
on
the
nearest
river
and
with
no
hope
of
reinforcements
at
the
end
of
two
weeks
he
humbly
sued
for
peace
offering
to
quit
wessex
for
good
and
even
to
embrace
the
christian
religion
strange
as
it
may
seem
alfred
granted
his
request
either
with
profound
statesmanship
not
wishing
to
drive
a
desperate
enemy
to
extremities
or
seeking
his
conversion
the
remains
of
the
discomfited
pagan
host
crossed
over
into
mercia
and
gave
no
further
trouble
never
was
a
conquest
attended
with
happier
results
guthrun
with
thirty
of
his
principal
nobles
was
baptized
into
the
christian
faith
and
received
the
saxon
name
of
athelstan
but
east
anglia
became
a
danish
kingdom
the
danes
were
not
expelled
from
england
their
settlement
was
permanent
the
treaty
of
wedmore
confirmed
them
in
their
possessions
alfred
by
this
treaty
was
acknowledged
as
undisputed
master
of
england
south
of
the
thames
of
wessex
and
essex
including
london
hertford
and
albans
of
the
whole
of
mercia
west
of
watling
street
the
great
road
from
london
to
chester
but
the
danes
retained
also
one
half
of
england
which
shows
how
formidable
they
were
even
in
defeat
the
danes
and
the
saxons
it
would
seem
commingled
and
gradually
became
one
nation
the
great
danish
invasion
of
the
ninth
century
was
successful
since
it
gave
half
of
england
to
the
pagans
it
is
a
sad
thing
to
contemplate
civilization
was
doubtless
retarded
whole
districts
were
depopulated
and
monasteries
and
churches
were
ruthlessly
destroyed
with
their
libraries
and
works
of
art
this
could
not
have
happened
without
a
fearful
demoralization
among
the
saxons
themselves
they
had
become
prosperous
and
their
wealth
was
succeeded
by
vices
especially
luxury
and
sloth
their
wealth
tempted
the
more
needy
of
the
adventurers
from
the
north
who
succeeded
in
their
aggressions
because
they
were
stronger
than
the
saxons
so
slow
was
the
progress
of
england
in
civilization
as
soon
as
it
became
centralized
under
a
single
monarch
it
was
subjected
to
fresh
calamities
it
would
seem
that
the
history
of
those
ages
is
simply
the
history
of
violence
and
spoliations
there
was
the
perpetual
waste
of
human
energies
barbarism
seemed
to
be
stronger
than
civilization
nor
in
this
respect
was
the
condition
of
england
unique
the
same
public
misfortunes
happened
in
france
germany
italy
and
spain
for
five
hundred
years
europe
was
the
scene
of
constant
strife
not
until
the
normans
settled
in
england
were
the
waves
of
barbaric
invasion
arrested
the
danish
conquest
made
a
profound
impression
on
alfred
and
stimulated
him
to
renewed
efforts
to
preserve
what
still
remained
of
christian
civilization
his
whole
subsequent
life
was
spent
in
actual
war
with
the
northmen
or
in
preparations
for
war
it
was
remarkable
that
he
succeeded
as
well
as
he
did
for
after
all
he
was
the
sovereign
of
scarcely
half
the
territory
that
egbert
had
won
and
over
which
his
grandfather
and
father
had
ruled
he
preserved
wessex
and
in
preserving
wessex
he
saved
england
which
would
have
been
replunged
in
barbarism
but
for
his
perseverance
energy
and
courage
that
danish
invasion
was
a
chastisement
not
undeserved
for
both
the
clergy
and
the
laity
had
become
corrupt
had
been
enervated
by
prosperity
the
clergy
especially
were
lazy
and
ignorant
not
one
in
a
thousand
could
write
a
common
letter
of
salutation
they
had
fattened
on
the
contributions
of
princes
and
of
the
credulous
people
they
saw
the
destruction
of
their
richest
and
proudest
abbeys
and
their
lands
seized
by
pagan
barbarians
who
settled
down
in
them
as
lords
of
the
soil
especially
in
northumbria
but
alfred
at
least
arrested
their
further
progress
and
threw
them
on
the
defensive
he
knew
that
the
recovery
of
the
conquests
which
the
saxons
had
made
was
a
work
of
exceeding
difficulty
it
was
necessary
to
make
great
preparations
for
future
struggles
as
peace
with
the
danes
was
only
a
truce
they
aimed
at
the
complete
conquest
of
the
island
and
they
sought
to
rouse
the
hostility
of
the
welsh
alfred
showed
a
wise
precaution
against
future
assaults
in
constructing
fortresses
at
the
most
important
points
within
his
control
before
his
day
the
saxons
had
but
few
fortified
positions
and
this
want
of
forts
had
greatly
facilitated
the
danish
conquest
but
the
danes
as
soon
as
they
gained
a
strong
position
fortified
it
and
were
never
afterwards
ejected
by
force
probably
alfred
took
the
hint
from
them
he
rebuilt
and
strengthened
the
fortresses
along
the
coast
as
he
had
four
precious
years
of
unmolested
work
and
for
this
his
small
kingdom
was
doubtless
severely
taxed
he
imported
skilled
workmen
and
adopted
the
newest
improvements
he
made
use
of
stone
instead
of
timber
and
extended
his
works
of
construction
to
palaces
halls
and
churches
as
well
as
castles
so
well
built
were
his
fortifications
that
no
strong
place
was
ever
afterwards
wrested
from
him
in
those
times
the
defence
of
kingdoms
was
in
castles
they
marked
the
feudal
ages
equally
with
monasteries
and
cathedral
churches
castles
protected
the
realm
from
invasion
and
conquest
as
much
as
they
did
the
family
of
a
feudal
noble
the
wisdom
as
well
as
the
necessity
of
fortified
cities
was
seen
in
a
marked
manner
when
the
northmen
in
stole
up
the
thames
and
medway
and
made
an
unexpected
assault
on
rochester
they
were
completely
foiled
and
were
obliged
to
retreat
to
their
ships
leaving
behind
them
even
the
spoil
they
had
brought
from
france
this
successful
resistance
was
a
great
moral
assistance
to
alfred
since
it
opened
the
eyes
of
bishops
and
nobles
to
the
necessity
of
fortifying
their
towns
to
which
they
had
hitherto
been
opposed
being
unwilling
to
incur
the
expense
so
it
was
not
long
before
alfred
had
a
complete
chain
of
defences
on
the
coast
as
well
as
around
his
cities
and
palaces
able
to
resist
sudden
attacks
which
he
had
most
to
fear
his
great
work
of
fortification
was
that
of
london
which
though
belonging
to
him
by
the
peace
of
wedmore
was
neglected
fallen
to
decay
filled
with
lawless
bands
of
marauders
and
pirates
and
defenceless
against
attack
in
he
marched
against
this
city
which
made
no
serious
resistance
rebuilt
it
made
it
habitable
fortified
it
and
encouraged
people
to
settle
in
it
for
he
foresaw
its
vast
commercial
importance
under
the
rule
of
his
son
ethelred
it
regained
the
it
had
enjoyed
under
the
romans
as
a
commercial
centre
having
done
what
he
could
to
protect
his
dominion
from
sudden
attacks
alfred
then
turned
his
attention
to
the
reorganization
of
his
army
and
navy
strictly
speaking
he
had
no
regular
army
or
standing
force
which
he
could
call
his
own
when
the
country
was
threatened
the
freemen
flew
to
arms
under
their
eorls
and
ealdormen
and
on
this
force
the
king
was
obliged
to
rely
they
sometimes
acted
without
his
orders
obeying
the
calls
of
their
leaders
when
danger
was
most
imminent
on
the
men
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
danger
the
brunt
of
the
contest
fell
nor
could
levies
be
relied
upon
for
any
length
of
time
they
dwindled
after
a
few
weeks
in
order
to
attend
to
their
agricultural
interests
for
agriculture
was
the
only
great
and
permanent
pursuit
in
the
feudal
ages
everything
was
subordinate
to
labors
in
the
field
the
only
wealth
was
in
land
except
what
was
hoarded
by
the
clergy
and
nobles
how
well
alfred
paid
his
soldiers
it
is
difficult
to
determine
his
own
private
means
were
large
and
the
crown
lands
were
very
extensive
of
his
income
was
spent
upon
his
army
but
it
is
not
probable
that
a
large
force
was
under
pay
in
time
of
peace
yet
he
had
always
one
third
of
his
forces
ready
to
act
promptly
against
an
enemy
the
burden
of
the
service
was
distributed
over
the
whole
kingdom
the
main
feature
of
his
military
reform
seems
to
have
been
in
the
division
of
his
forces
into
three
bodies
only
one
of
which
was
liable
to
be
called
upon
for
service
at
a
time
except
in
great
emergencies
in
regard
to
tactics
or
changes
in
armor
and
mode
of
fighting
we
know
nothing
for
war
as
an
art
or
science
did
not
exist
in
any
teutonic
kingdom
it
was
lost
with
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
how
far
alfred
was
gifted
with
military
genius
we
are
unable
to
say
beyond
courage
fertility
of
resources
activity
of
movement
and
a
marvellous
patience
his
greatest
qualities
were
moral
like
those
of
washington
it
is
his
reproachless
character
and
his
devotion
to
duty
and
love
of
his
people
which
impress
us
from
first
to
last
as
has
been
said
of
marcus
aurelius
alfred
was
a
saint
anselm
on
a
throne
he
had
none
of
those
turbulent
and
restless
qualities
which
we
associate
with
mediaeval
kings
what
a
contrast
between
him
and
william
the
conqueror
alfred
also
gave
his
attention
to
the
construction
of
a
navy
as
well
as
to
the
organization
of
an
army
knowing
that
it
was
necessary
to
resist
the
northmen
on
the
ocean
and
prevent
their
landing
on
the
coast
in
he
had
fought
a
naval
battle
with
success
and
had
taken
one
of
the
ships
of
the
which
furnished
him
with
a
model
to
build
his
own
ships
doing
the
same
thing
that
the
romans
did
in
their
early
naval
warfare
with
the
carthaginians
in
he
destroyed
a
danish
fleet
on
its
way
to
relieve
exeter
but
he
soon
made
considerable
improvement
on
the
ships
of
his
enemies
making
them
twice
as
long
as
those
of
the
danes
with
a
larger
number
of
oars
these
were
steadier
and
swifter
than
the
older
vessels
as
the
west
saxons
were
not
a
seafaring
people
he
employed
and
munificently
rewarded
men
from
other
nations
more
accustomed
to
the
sea
whether
frisians
franks
britons
scots
or
even
danes
the
result
was
he
was
never
badly
beaten
at
sea
and
before
the
end
of
his
reign
he
had
swept
the
coast
clear
of
pirates
within
two
years
from
the
treaty
of
wedmore
his
fleet
was
ready
for
action
he
was
prepared
to
meet
the
on
equal
terms
and
in
he
had
gained
an
important
naval
battle
over
a
fleet
that
was
meditating
an
invasion
in
the
year
the
danes
again
invaded
england
and
laid
siege
to
rochester
but
fled
to
their
ships
on
the
approach
of
alfred
they
were
pursued
by
the
saxon
king
and
defeated
with
great
slaughter
sixteen
danish
vessels
being
destroyed
and
their
crews
put
to
the
sword
nor
had
guthrun
athelstan
the
been
true
to
his
engagements
he
had
allowed
two
additional
settlements
of
danes
on
the
east
anglian
coasts
and
had
even
assisted
alfred
enemies
their
defeat
however
induced
him
to
live
peaceably
in
east
anglia
until
he
died
in
these
successes
of
alfred
secured
peace
with
the
danes
for
eight
more
years
during
which
he
pursued
his
various
schemes
for
the
improvement
of
his
people
and
in
preparations
for
future
wars
he
had
put
his
kingdom
in
a
state
of
defence
and
now
turned
his
attention
to
legislation
the
supremest
labor
of
an
enlightened
monarch
the
laws
of
alfred
wear
a
close
resemblance
to
those
which
moses
gave
to
the
hebrews
and
moreover
are
pervaded
with
christian
ideas
his
aim
seems
to
have
been
to
recognize
in
his
jurisprudence
the
supreme
obedience
which
is
due
to
the
laws
of
god
in
all
the
laws
of
the
converted
teutonic
nations
from
charlemagne
down
we
notice
the
influence
of
the
christian
clergy
in
modifying
the
severity
of
the
old
pagan
codes
alfred
did
not
aim
to
be
an
original
legislator
like
moses
or
solon
but
selected
from
the
mosaic
code
and
also
from
the
laws
of
ethelbert
ina
offa
and
other
saxon
princes
those
regulations
which
he
considered
best
adapted
to
the
circumstances
of
the
people
whom
he
governed
he
recognized
more
completely
than
any
of
his
predecessors
the
rights
of
property
and
attached
great
sanctity
to
oaths
whoever
violated
his
pledge
was
sentenced
to
imprisonment
he
raised
the
dignity
of
ealdormen
and
bishops
to
that
of
the
highest
rank
he
made
treason
against
the
royal
authority
the
gravest
offence
known
to
the
laws
and
all
were
deemed
traitors
who
should
presume
to
draw
the
sword
in
the
king
house
he
made
new
provisions
for
personal
security
and
severely
punished
theft
and
robbery
of
every
kind
especially
of
the
property
of
the
church
he
bestowed
freedom
on
slaves
after
six
years
of
service
some
think
he
instituted
trial
by
jury
like
theodosius
and
charlemagne
he
gave
peculiar
privileges
to
the
clergy
as
a
counterpoise
to
the
lawlessness
of
nobles
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
his
legislation
was
compensation
for
crime
seen
alike
in
the
mosaic
dispensation
and
in
the
old
customs
of
the
germanic
nations
in
their
native
forests
on
conviction
the
culprit
was
compelled
to
pay
a
sum
of
money
to
the
relatives
of
the
injured
and
another
sum
to
the
community
at
large
this
compensation
varied
according
to
the
rank
of
the
injured
party
and
rank
was
determined
by
wealth
the
owner
of
two
hydes
of
land
was
ranked
above
a
ceorl
or
simple
farmer
while
the
owner
of
twelve
hydes
was
a
royal
thane
in
the
compensation
for
crime
the
gradation
was
curious
twelve
shillings
would
pay
for
the
loss
of
a
foot
ten
for
a
great
toe
and
twenty
for
a
thumb
if
a
man
robbed
his
equal
he
was
compelled
to
pay
threefold
if
he
robbed
the
king
he
paid
ninefold
and
if
he
robbed
the
church
he
was
obliged
to
return
twelvefold
hence
the
robbery
of
ecclesiastical
property
was
attended
with
such
severe
penalties
that
it
was
unusual
in
some
cases
theft
was
punished
with
death
the
code
of
alfred
was
severe
but
in
an
age
of
crime
and
disorder
severity
was
necessary
he
also
instituted
a
vigorous
police
and
divided
the
country
into
counties
and
these
again
into
hundreds
or
parishes
each
of
which
was
made
responsible
for
the
maintenance
of
order
and
the
detection
of
crime
he
was
severe
on
judges
when
they
passed
sentence
irrespective
of
the
rights
of
jurors
he
did
not
emancipate
slaves
but
he
ameliorated
their
condition
and
limited
their
term
of
compulsory
service
burglary
in
the
king
house
was
punished
by
a
fine
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
shillings
in
an
archbishop
at
ninety
in
a
bishop
or
ealdorman
at
sixty
in
the
house
of
a
man
of
twelve
hydes
at
thirty
shillings
in
a
man
at
fifteen
in
a
churl
at
five
shillings
the
fine
being
graded
according
to
the
rank
of
him
whose
house
had
been
entered
there
was
a
rigorous
punishment
for
working
on
sunday
if
a
theow
by
order
of
his
lord
the
lord
had
to
pay
a
penalty
of
thirty
shillings
if
without
the
lord
order
he
was
condemned
to
be
flogged
if
a
freeman
worked
without
his
lord
order
he
had
to
pay
sixty
shillings
or
forfeit
his
freedom
if
a
man
was
found
burning
a
tree
in
a
forest
he
was
obliged
to
pay
a
fine
of
sixty
shillings
in
order
to
protect
the
forest
or
if
he
cut
down
a
tree
under
which
thirty
swine
might
stand
he
was
obliged
to
pay
a
fine
of
sixty
shillings
these
penalties
seem
severe
but
they
were
inflicted
for
offences
difficult
to
be
detected
and
frequently
committed
we
infer
from
these
various
fines
that
burglary
robbery
petty
larcenies
and
brawls
were
the
most
common
offences
against
the
laws
one
of
the
greatest
services
which
alfred
rendered
to
the
cause
of
civilization
in
england
was
in
separating
judicial
from
executive
functions
the
old
eorls
and
ealdormen
were
warriors
and
yet
to
them
had
been
committed
the
administration
of
justice
which
they
often
abused
frequently
deciding
cases
against
the
verdicts
of
jurors
and
sometimes
unjustly
dooming
innocent
men
to
capital
punishment
alfred
hanged
an
ealdorman
or
alderman
one
freberne
for
sentencing
haspin
to
death
when
the
jury
was
in
doubt
he
even
hanged
inferior
officers
on
whom
judicial
duties
devolved
for
palpable
injustice
the
love
of
justice
and
truth
was
one
of
the
main
traits
of
character
and
he
painfully
perceived
that
the
ealdormen
of
shires
though
faithful
and
valiant
warriors
were
not
learned
and
impartial
enough
to
administer
justice
there
was
scarcely
one
of
them
who
could
read
the
written
law
or
who
had
any
extensive
acquaintance
with
the
common
law
or
the
usages
which
had
been
in
force
from
time
immemorial
as
far
back
as
in
the
original
villages
of
germany
moreover
the
poor
and
defenceless
had
need
of
protection
they
always
had
needed
it
for
in
pagan
and
barbarous
countries
their
rights
were
too
often
disregarded
when
brute
force
bore
everything
before
it
it
became
both
the
duty
and
privilege
of
the
king
who
represented
central
power
to
maintain
the
rights
of
the
humblest
of
his
people
to
whom
he
was
a
father
to
see
justice
enforced
is
the
most
exalted
of
the
prerogatives
of
sovereigns
and
no
one
appreciated
this
delegation
of
sovereign
power
from
the
universal
father
more
than
alfred
the
most
conscientious
and
of
all
the
kings
of
the
middle
ages
so
to
maintain
justice
alfred
set
aside
the
ignorant
and
passionate
ealdormen
and
appointed
judges
whose
sole
duty
it
was
to
interpret
and
enforce
the
laws
and
men
best
fitted
to
represent
the
king
in
the
royal
courts
they
were
sent
through
the
shires
to
see
that
justice
was
done
and
to
report
the
decisions
of
the
county
courts
thus
came
into
existence
the
judges
of
assize
an
office
or
institution
which
remains
to
this
day
amid
all
the
revolutions
of
english
thought
and
life
and
all
the
changes
which
politics
and
dynasties
have
wrought
nor
did
alfred
rest
with
a
reform
of
the
law
courts
he
defined
the
boundaries
of
shires
which
divisions
are
very
old
and
subdivided
them
into
parishes
which
have
remained
to
this
day
he
gave
to
each
hundred
its
court
from
which
appeals
were
made
to
a
court
representing
several
hundreds
about
three
to
each
county
each
hundred
was
subdivided
into
tythings
or
companies
of
ten
neighboring
householders
who
were
held
as
mutual
sureties
or
frank
free
pledges
for
each
other
orderly
conduct
so
that
each
man
was
a
member
of
a
tything
and
was
obliged
to
keep
household
rolls
of
his
servants
thus
every
liegeman
was
known
to
the
law
and
was
taught
his
duties
and
obligations
and
every
tything
was
responsible
for
the
production
of
its
criminals
and
obliged
to
pay
a
fine
if
they
escaped
every
householder
was
liable
to
answer
for
any
stranger
who
might
stop
at
his
house
this
mutual
liability
or
suretyship
was
the
pivot
of
all
alfred
administrative
reform
and
wrought
a
remarkable
change
in
the
kingdom
so
that
merchants
and
travellers
could
go
about
without
armed
guards
the
forests
were
emptied
of
outlaws
and
confidence
and
security
succeeded
distrust
and
lawlessness
the
frank
which
was
worked
in
country
districts
was
supplied
in
towns
by
the
machinery
of
the
guilds
institutions
combining
the
benefit
of
modern
clubs
insurance
societies
and
as
a
rule
they
were
limited
to
members
of
one
trade
or
calling
pearson
in
his
history
of
england
as
quoted
by
hughes
thus
sums
up
this
great
administrative
reform
for
the
preservation
of
life
and
property
and
order
during
the
middle
ages
what
is
essential
to
remember
is
that
life
and
property
were
not
secured
to
the
by
the
state
but
by
the
loyal
union
of
his
the
saxon
guilds
are
unmatched
in
the
history
of
their
times
as
evidences
of
mutual
trust
patient
and
orderly
love
of
law
among
a
young
people
to
recapitulate
the
reforms
of
alfred
in
the
administration
of
justice
and
the
resettlement
of
the
country
the
old
divisions
of
shires
were
carefully
readjusted
and
divided
into
hundreds
and
tythings
the
alderman
of
the
shire
still
remained
the
chief
officer
but
the
office
was
no
longer
hereditary
the
king
appointed
the
alderman
or
eorl
who
was
president
of
the
shire
gemot
or
council
and
chief
judge
of
the
county
court
as
well
as
governor
of
the
shire
but
was
assisted
and
probably
controlled
in
his
judicial
capacity
by
justices
appointed
by
the
king
and
not
attached
to
the
shire
or
in
any
way
dependent
on
the
alderman
the
or
nominees
of
the
alderman
were
abolished
and
an
officer
substituted
for
them
called
the
reeve
of
the
shire
or
sheriff
who
carried
out
the
decrees
of
the
courts
the
hundreds
and
tythings
were
represented
by
their
own
officers
and
had
their
and
which
exercised
a
trifling
criminal
jurisdiction
but
were
chiefly
assemblies
answering
to
our
grand
juries
and
parish
vestries
all
householders
were
members
of
them
and
every
man
thus
became
responsible
for
keeping
the
king
peace
in
regard
to
the
financial
resources
of
alfred
we
know
but
little
probably
they
were
great
considering
the
extent
and
population
of
the
little
kingdom
over
which
he
ruled
but
inconsiderable
in
comparison
with
the
revenues
of
england
at
the
present
day
to
build
fortresses
construct
a
navy
and
keep
in
pay
a
considerable
military
force
to
say
nothing
of
his
own
private
expenditure
and
the
expense
of
his
court
his
public
improvements
the
endowment
of
churches
the
support
of
schools
the
relief
of
the
poor
and
keeping
the
highways
and
bridges
in
repair
required
a
large
income
this
was
derived
from
the
public
revenues
crown
lands
and
private
property
the
public
revenue
was
raised
chiefly
by
customs
tolls
and
fines
the
crown
lands
were
very
extensive
as
well
as
the
private
property
of
the
sovereign
as
he
had
large
estates
in
every
county
of
his
kingdom
but
whatever
his
income
he
set
apart
one
quarter
of
it
for
religious
purposes
for
architecture
and
for
the
poor
besides
a
considerable
sum
for
foreigners
whom
he
liberally
patronized
he
richly
endowed
schools
and
monasteries
he
was
devoted
to
the
church
and
his
relations
with
the
pope
were
pleasant
and
intimate
although
more
independent
than
those
of
many
of
his
successors
all
the
biographers
of
alfred
speak
of
his
zealous
efforts
in
behalf
of
education
he
established
a
school
for
the
young
nobles
of
his
court
and
taught
them
himself
his
teachers
were
chiefly
learned
men
drawn
from
the
continent
especially
from
the
franks
and
were
well
paid
by
the
king
he
made
the
scholarly
asser
a
welsh
monk
afterwards
bishop
of
sherborne
from
whose
biography
of
alfred
our
best
information
is
derived
his
counsellor
and
friend
and
from
his
instructions
acquired
much
knowledge
to
asser
he
gave
the
general
superintendence
of
education
not
merely
for
laymen
but
for
priests
in
his
own
words
he
declared
that
his
wish
was
that
all
youth
should
persevere
in
learning
until
they
could
read
the
english
scriptures
for
those
who
desired
to
devote
themselves
to
the
church
he
provided
the
means
for
the
study
of
latin
he
gave
all
his
children
a
good
education
his
own
thirst
for
knowledge
was
remarkable
considering
his
cares
and
public
duties
he
copied
the
with
his
own
hands
and
always
carried
it
in
his
bosom
asser
read
to
him
all
the
books
which
were
then
accessible
from
an
humble
scholar
the
king
soon
became
an
author
he
translated
consolations
of
philosophy
from
the
latin
of
boethius
a
roman
senator
of
the
sixth
century
the
most
remarkable
literary
effort
of
the
declining
days
of
the
roman
empire
and
highly
prized
in
the
middle
ages
he
also
translated
the
chronicle
of
the
world
by
orosius
a
spanish
priest
who
lived
in
the
early
part
of
the
fifth
century
a
work
suggested
by
saint
augustine
city
of
god
the
ecclesiastical
history
of
bede
was
also
translated
by
alfred
he
is
said
to
have
translated
the
proverbs
of
solomon
and
the
fables
of
aesop
his
greatest
literary
work
however
was
the
chronicle
the
principal
authority
of
the
reign
of
alfred
no
man
of
his
day
wrote
the
saxon
language
so
purely
as
did
alfred
himself
and
he
was
distinguished
not
only
for
his
knowledge
of
latin
but
for
profound
philosophical
reflections
interspersed
through
his
writings
which
would
do
honor
to
a
father
of
the
church
he
was
also
a
poet
inferior
only
to
caedmon
nor
was
his
knowledge
confined
to
literature
alone
it
was
extended
to
the
arts
especially
architecture
and
he
built
more
beautiful
edifices
than
any
of
his
predecessors
he
also
had
a
knowledge
of
geography
beyond
his
contemporaries
and
sent
a
norwegian
to
explore
the
white
sea
he
enriched
his
translation
of
orosius
by
a
sketch
of
the
new
geographical
discoveries
in
the
north
in
fact
there
was
scarcely
any
branch
of
knowledge
then
known
in
which
alfred
was
not
well
instructed
being
a
remarkably
learned
man
for
his
age
and
as
enlightened
as
he
was
learned
but
in
the
midst
of
his
reforms
and
wise
efforts
to
civilize
his
people
the
gathered
once
more
and
he
was
obliged
to
put
forth
all
his
energies
to
defend
his
realm
from
the
incursions
of
his
old
enemies
the
death
of
charles
the
bald
in
the
year
left
france
in
a
very
disordered
state
and
the
northmen
under
hasting
one
of
the
greatest
of
their
vikings
recommenced
their
ravages
in
they
crossed
the
channel
in
two
hundred
and
fifty
vessels
and
invaded
england
followed
soon
after
by
hasting
with
another
large
detachment
and
strongly
intrenched
themselves
near
winchester
alfred
at
the
same
time
strongly
fortified
his
own
position
about
thirty
miles
distant
and
kept
so
close
a
watch
over
the
movements
of
his
enemies
that
they
rarely
ventured
beyond
their
own
intrenchments
a
sort
of
desultory
warfare
succeeded
and
continued
for
a
year
without
any
decisive
results
at
last
the
danes
getting
weary
broke
up
their
camps
and
resolved
to
pass
into
east
anglia
they
were
met
by
alfred
at
farnham
and
forced
to
fight
which
resulted
in
their
defeat
and
the
loss
of
all
the
spoils
they
had
taken
and
all
the
horses
they
had
brought
from
france
the
discomfited
danes
retreated
by
means
of
their
ships
to
an
island
in
the
thames
at
its
junction
with
the
colne
where
they
were
invested
by
alfred
they
would
soon
have
been
at
the
mercy
of
the
saxon
king
had
it
not
unfortunately
happened
that
the
danes
on
the
east
coast
from
essex
to
northumbria
joined
the
invaders
which
event
compelled
alfred
to
raise
the
blockade
and
send
ethelred
his
son
to
the
west
where
the
danes
were
again
strongly
intrenched
at
banfleet
near
london
their
camp
was
successfully
stormed
and
much
booty
was
taken
together
with
the
wife
and
sons
of
hasting
the
danish
fleet
was
also
captured
and
some
of
the
vessels
were
sent
to
london
but
hasting
still
held
out
in
spite
of
his
disaster
and
succeeded
in
intrenching
himself
with
the
remnants
of
his
army
at
shoebury
ten
miles
from
banfleet
from
which
he
issued
on
a
marauding
expedition
along
the
northern
banks
of
the
thames
carrying
fire
and
sword
wherever
he
went
thence
turned
northward
making
no
halt
until
he
reached
the
banks
of
the
severn
where
he
again
intrenched
himself
but
was
again
beaten
hasting
saved
himself
by
falling
back
on
a
part
of
east
anglia
removed
from
influence
and
appeared
near
chester
alfred
himself
had
undertaken
the
task
of
guarding
exeter
and
the
coasts
of
devonshire
and
south
wales
where
he
wintered
leaving
ethelred
to
pursue
hasting
thus
a
year
passed
in
the
successful
defence
of
the
kingdom
the
danes
having
gained
no
important
advantage
at
the
end
of
the
second
campaign
hasting
still
maintained
his
ground
and
fortified
himself
on
the
thames
within
twenty
miles
of
london
at
the
close
of
the
third
year
hasting
being
driven
from
his
position
on
the
thames
established
himself
in
shropshire
in
the
spring
of
hasting
broke
up
his
last
camp
on
the
english
soil
being
foiled
at
every
point
and
crossed
the
sea
with
the
remnant
of
his
followers
to
the
banks
of
the
seine
the
war
was
now
virtually
at
an
end
and
the
danes
utterly
defeated
the
work
for
which
alfred
was
raised
up
was
at
last
accomplished
he
had
stayed
the
inundations
of
the
northmen
defended
his
kingdom
of
wessex
and
planted
the
seeds
of
a
higher
civilization
in
england
winning
the
love
and
admiration
of
his
subjects
the
greatness
of
alfred
should
not
be
measured
by
the
size
of
his
kingdom
it
is
not
the
bigness
of
a
country
that
gives
fame
to
its
illustrious
men
the
immortal
heroes
of
palestine
and
greece
ruled
over
territories
smaller
and
of
less
importance
than
the
kingdom
of
wessex
it
is
the
greatness
of
their
characters
that
preserves
their
name
and
memory
alfred
died
in
the
year
at
the
age
of
worn
out
with
disease
and
labors
leaving
his
kingdom
in
a
prosperous
state
and
it
had
rest
under
his
son
edward
for
nine
years
then
the
contest
was
renewed
with
the
danes
and
it
was
under
the
reign
of
edward
that
mercia
was
once
more
annexed
to
wessex
as
well
as
northumbria
edward
died
in
and
under
the
reign
of
his
son
aethelstan
the
saxon
kingdom
reached
still
greater
prosperity
the
completion
of
the
west
saxon
realm
was
reserved
for
edmund
son
of
aethelstan
who
ascended
the
throne
in
being
a
mere
boy
he
was
ruled
by
the
greatest
statesman
of
that
age
the
celebrated
dunstan
abbot
of
glastonbury
and
archbishop
of
canterbury
a
great
statesman
and
a
great
churchman
like
hincmar
of
rheims
thus
the
heroism
and
patience
of
alfred
were
rewarded
by
the
restoration
of
the
saxon
power
and
the
absorption
of
what
green
calls
danelagh
after
a
long
and
bitter
contest
of
which
alfred
was
the
greatest
hero
in
surveying
his
conquests
we
are
reminded
of
the
long
contest
which
charlemagne
had
with
the
saxons
next
to
charlemagne
alfred
was
the
greatest
prince
who
reigned
in
europe
after
the
dissolution
of
the
roman
empire
until
the
norman
conquest
he
fought
not
for
the
desire
of
bequeathing
a
great
empire
to
his
descendants
but
to
rescue
his
country
from
ruin
in
the
midst
of
overwhelming
calamities
it
was
a
struggle
for
national
existence
not
military
glory
in
the
successful
defence
of
his
kingdom
against
the
ravages
of
pagan
invaders
he
may
be
likened
to
william
the
silent
in
preserving
the
nationality
of
holland
no
european
monarch
from
the
time
of
alfred
can
be
compared
to
him
in
the
service
he
rendered
to
his
country
the
memorableness
of
a
war
is
to
be
gauged
not
by
the
number
of
the
combatants
but
by
the
sacredness
of
a
cause
it
was
the
devotion
of
washington
to
a
great
cause
which
embalms
his
memory
in
the
heart
of
the
world
and
no
english
king
has
left
so
hallowed
a
name
as
alfred
it
was
because
he
was
a
benefactor
and
infused
his
energy
of
purpose
into
a
discouraged
and
afflicted
people
how
far
his
virtues
were
imitated
it
is
difficult
to
tell
religion
was
the
groundwork
of
his
character
faith
in
god
and
devotion
to
duty
his
piety
was
also
more
enlightened
than
the
piety
of
his
age
since
it
was
practical
and
not
ascetic
his
temper
was
open
frank
and
genial
he
loved
books
and
strangers
and
travellers
there
was
nothing
cynical
about
him
in
spite
of
his
perplexities
and
discouragements
he
had
a
beautifully
balanced
character
and
a
nature
he
had
the
power
of
inspiring
confidence
in
defeat
and
danger
his
judgment
and
good
sense
seemed
to
fit
him
for
any
emergency
he
had
the
same
control
over
himself
that
he
had
over
others
his
patriotism
and
singleness
of
purpose
inspired
devotion
he
felt
his
burdens
but
did
not
seek
to
throw
them
off
hardship
and
sorrow
said
he
not
a
king
but
would
wish
to
be
without
these
if
he
could
but
i
know
he
can
not
so
long
as
i
have
lived
i
have
striven
to
live
worthily
i
desire
to
leave
to
the
men
that
come
after
me
a
remembrance
of
me
in
good
works
these
were
some
of
his
precious
utterances
so
that
the
love
which
he
won
a
thousand
years
ago
has
lingered
around
his
name
from
that
day
to
this
it
was
a
strong
sense
of
duty
quickened
by
a
christian
life
which
gave
to
the
character
of
alfred
its
peculiar
radiance
he
felt
his
responsibilities
as
a
christian
ruler
he
was
affable
courteous
accessible
his
body
was
frail
and
delicate
but
his
energies
were
never
relaxed
pride
and
haughtiness
were
unknown
in
his
intercourse
with
bishops
or
nobles
he
had
no
striking
defects
he
was
the
model
of
a
man
and
a
king
and
he
left
the
impress
of
his
genius
on
all
the
subsequent
institutions
of
his
country
the
tree
says
pauli
one
of
his
ablest
biographers
which
now
casts
its
shadow
far
and
near
over
the
world
when
menaced
with
destruction
in
its
bud
was
carefully
guarded
by
alfred
but
at
the
period
when
it
was
ready
to
burst
forth
into
a
plant
he
was
forced
to
leave
it
to
the
influence
of
time
many
great
men
have
occupied
themselves
with
the
care
of
this
tree
and
each
in
his
own
way
has
advanced
its
growth
william
the
conqueror
with
his
iron
hand
bent
the
tender
branches
to
his
will
henry
the
second
ruled
the
saxons
with
true
roman
pride
but
in
the
old
german
nature
became
aroused
and
worked
powerfully
even
among
the
barons
it
became
free
under
edward
the
third
that
prince
so
ambitious
of
conquest
the
old
language
and
the
old
law
the
one
somewhat
altered
the
other
much
softened
opened
the
path
to
a
new
era
the
nation
stood
like
an
oak
in
the
full
strength
of
its
leafy
maturity
and
to
this
strength
the
reformation
is
indebted
for
its
accomplishment
elizabeth
the
greatest
woman
who
ever
sat
upon
a
throne
occupied
a
central
position
in
a
golden
age
of
power
and
literature
then
came
the
stuarts
who
with
their
despotic
ideas
outraged
the
saxon
individuality
of
the
english
and
by
their
fall
contributed
to
the
sure
development
of
that
freedom
which
was
founded
so
long
before
the
stern
cromwell
and
the
astute
william

third
aided
in
preparing
for
the
now
advanced
nation
that
path
in
which
it
has
ever
since
moved
the
race
has
already
attained
maturity
in
the
new
world
and
founded
on
these
pillars
it
will
triumph
in
all
places
and
in

age
alfred
name
will
always
be
placed
among
those
of
the
great
spirits
of
this
earth
and
so
long
as
men
regard
their

with
reverence
they
will
not
venture
to
bring
forward

in

queen
elizabeth
woman
as
a
sovereign
i
do
not
present
queen
elizabeth
either
as
a
very
interesting
or
as
a
faultless
woman
as
a
woman
she
is
not
a
popular
favorite
but
it
is
my
object
to
present
her
as
a
queen
to
show
with
what
dignity
and
ability
a
woman
may
fill
one
of
the
most
difficult
and
responsible
stations
of
the
world
it
is
certain
that
we
associate
with
her
a
very
prosperous
and
successful
reign
and
if
she
was
lacking
in
those
feminine
qualities
which
make
woman
interesting
to
man
we
are
constrained
to
admire
her
for
those
talents
and
virtues
which
shed
lustre
around
a
throne
she
is
unquestionably
one
of
the
links
in
the
history
of
england
and
of
modern
civilization
and
her
reign
is
so
remarkable
considering
the
difficulties
with
which
she
had
to
contend
that
she
may
justly
be
regarded
as
one
of
the
benefactors
of
her
age
and
country
it
is
a
pleasant
task
to
point
out
the
greatness
rather
than
the
defects
of
so
illustrious
a
woman
it
is
my
main
object
to
describe
her
services
to
her
country
for
it
is
by
services
that
all
monarchs
are
to
be
judged
and
all
sovereigns
especially
those
armed
with
great
power
are
exposed
to
unusual
temptations
which
must
ever
qualify
our
judgments
even
bad
men
like
caesar
richelieu
and
napoleon
have
obtained
favorable
verdicts
in
view
of
their
services
and
when
sovereigns
whose
characters
have
been
sullied
by
weaknesses
and
defects
yet
who
have
escaped
great
crimes
and
scandals
and
devoted
themselves
to
the
good
of
their
country
have
proved
themselves
to
be
wise
enlightened
and
patriotic
great
praise
has
been
awarded
to
them
thus
henry
iv
of
france
and
william
iii
of
england
have
been
admired
in
spite
of
their
defects
queen
elizabeth
is
the
first
among
the
great
female
sovereigns
of
the
world
with
whose
reign
we
associate
a
decided
progress
in
national
wealth
power
and
prosperity
so
that
she
ranks
with
the
great
men
who
have
administered
kingdoms
if
i
can
prove
this
fact
the
sex
should
be
proud
of
so
illustrious
a
woman
and
should
be
charitable
to
those
foibles
which
sullied
the
beauty
of
her
character
since
they
were
in
part
faults
of
the
age
and
developed
by
the
circumstances
which
surrounded
her
she
was
born
in
the
year
the
rough
age
of
luther
when
charles
was
dreaming
of
establishing
a
united
continental
military
empire
and
when
the
princes
of
the
house
of
valois
were
battling
with
the
ideas
of
the
reformation
an
earnest
revolutionary
and
progressive
age
she
was
educated
as
the
second
daughter
of
henry
viii
naturally
would
be
having
the
celebrated
ascham
as
her
tutor
in
greek
latin
french
and
italian
she
was
precocious
as
well
as
studious
and
astonished
her
teachers
by
her
attainments
she
was
probably
the
woman
in
england
next
to
lady
jane
grey
and
she
excelled
in
those
departments
of
knowledge
for
which
novels
have
given
such
distaste
in
these
more
enlightened
times
elizabeth
was
a
mere
girl
when
her
mother
anne
boleyn
was
executed
for
infidelities
and
levities
to
which
her
husband
could
not
be
blind
had
he
been
less
suspicious
a
cruel
execution
which
nothing
short
of
could
have
justified
even
in
that
rough
age
though
her
birth
was
declared
to
be
illegitimate
by
her
cruel
and
unscrupulous
father
yet
she
was
treated
as
a
princess
she
was
seventeen
when
her
hateful
old
father
died
and
during
the
six
years
when
the
government
was
in
the
hands
of
somerset
edward
vi
being
a
minor
elizabeth
was
exposed
to
no
peculiar
perils
except
those
of
the
heart
it
is
said
that
sir
thomas
seymour
brother
to
the
protector
made
a
strong
impression
on
her
and
that
she
would
have
married
him
had
the
council
consented
by
nature
elizabeth
was
affectionate
though
prudent
her
love
for
seymour
was
uncalculating
and
unselfish
though
he
was
unworthy
of
it
indeed
it
was
her
misfortune
always
to
misplace
her
affections
which
is
so
often
the
case
in
the
marriages
of
superior
women
as
if
they
loved
the
image
merely
which
their
own
minds
created
as
dante
did
when
he
bowed
down
to
beatrice
when
we
see
intellectual
men
choosing
weak
and
silly
women
for
wives
and
women
of
exalted
character
selecting
unworthy
and
wicked
husbands
it
does
seem
as
if
providence
determines
all
matrimonial
unions
independently
of
our
own
wills
and
settled
purposes
how
often
is
wealth
wedded
to
poverty
beauty
to
ugliness
and
amiability
to
the
hard
cold
unsocial
unsympathetic
wooden
scheming
selfish
man
is
the
only
one
who
seems
to
attain
his
end
since
he
can
bide
his
time
wait
for
somebody
to
fancy
him
elizabeth
had
that
mixed
character
which
made
her
life
a
perpetual
conflict
between
her
inclinations
and
her
interests
her
generous
impulses
and
affectionate
nature
made
her
peculiarly
susceptible
while
her
prudence
and
her
pride
kept
her
from
a
foolish
marriage
she
may
have
loved
unwisely
but
she
had
sufficient
to
prevent
a
mésalliance
while
she
may
have
resigned
herself
at
times
to
the
fascinations
of
accomplished
men
she
yet
fathomed
the
abyss
into
which
imprudence
would
bury
her
forever
on
the
accession
of
mary
her
elder
sister
daughter
of
catharine
of
aragon
elizabeth
position
was
exceedingly
critical
exposed
as
she
was
to
the
intrigues
of
the
catholics
and
the
jealousy
of
the
queen
and
when
we
remember
that
the
great
question
and
issue
of
that
age
was
whether
the
catholic
or
protestant
religion
should
have
the
ascendency
and
that
this
ascendency
seemed
to
hinge
upon
the
private
inclinations
of
the
sovereign
who
in
the
furtherance
of
this
great
end
would
scruple
at
nothing
to
accomplish
it
and
that
the
greatest
crimes
committed
for
its
sake
would
be
justified
by
all
the
sophistries
that
religious
partisanship
could
furnish
and
be
upheld
by
all
bigots
and
statesmen
as
well
as
priests
it
is
really
remarkable
that
elizabeth
was
spared
for
mary
was
not
only
urged
on
to
the
severest
measures
by
gardiner
and
bonner
the
bishops
of
winchester
and
london
and
by
all
the
influences
of
rome
to
which
she
was
devoted
body
and
soul
yea
by
all
her
confidential
advisers
in
the
state
to
save
themselves
from
future
contingencies
but
she
was
also
jealous
of
her
sister
as
elizabeth
was
afterwards
jealous
of
mary
stuart
and
it
would
have
been
as
easy
for
mary
to
execute
elizabeth
as
it
was
for
elizabeth
to
execute
the
queen
of
scots
or
henry
viii
to
behead
his
wives
and
such
a
crime
would
have
been
excused
as
readily
as
the
execution
of
somerset
or
of
the
lady
jane
grey
both
from
political
necessity
and
religious
expediency
elizabeth
was
indeed
subjected
to
great
humiliations
and
even
compelled
to
sue
for
her
life
what
more
piteous
than
her
letter
to
mary
begging
only
for
an
interview
wherefore
i
humbly
beseech
your
majesty
to
let
me
answer
before
yourself
and
once
again
kneeling
with
humbleness
of
heart
i
earnestly
crave
to
speak
to
your
highness
which
i
would
not
be
so
bold
as
to
desire
if
i
knew
not
myself
most
clear
as
i
know
myself
most
true
here
is
a
woman
pleading
for
her
life
to
a
sister
to
whom
she
had
done
no
wrong
and
whose
only
crime
was
in
being
that
heir
what
an
illustration
of
the
jealousy
of
royalty
and
the
bitterness
of
religious
feuds
and
what
a
contrast
in
this
servile
speech
to
that
arrogance
which
elizabeth
afterward
assumed
towards
her
parliament
and
greatest
lords
ah
to
what
cringing
meanness
are
most
people
reduced
by
adversity
in
what
pride
are
we
apt
to
indulge
in
the
hour
of
triumph
how
circumstances
change
the
whole
appearance
of
our
lives
elizabeth
however
in
order
to
save
her
life
was
obliged
to
dissemble
if
her
true
protestant
opinions
had
been
avowed
i
doubt
if
she
could
have
escaped
we
do
not
see
in
this
dissimulation
anything
very
lofty
yet
she
acted
with
singular
tact
and
discretion
it
is
creditable
however
to
mary
that
she
did
not
execute
her
sister
she
showed
herself
more
noble
than
elizabeth
did
later
in
her
treatment
of
the
queen
of
scots
history
calls
her
the
bloody
mary
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
she
was
the
victim
and
slave
of
religious
bigotry
and
that
she
sanctioned
many
bloody
executions
and
yet
it
would
appear
that
her
nature
was
after
all
affectionate
which
is
evinced
in
the
fact
that
she
did
spare
the
life
of
elizabeth
here
her
better
impulses
gained
the
victory
over
craft
and
policy
and
religious
intolerance
and
rescued
her
name
from
the
infamy
to
which
such
a
crime
would
have
doomed
her
and
which
her
church
would
have
sanctioned
and
in
which
it
would
have
rejoiced
as
much
as
it
did
in
the
slaughter
of
saint
bartholomew
the
crocodile
tears
which
elizabeth
is
said
to
have
shed
when
the
death
of
her
sister
mary
was
announced
to
her
at
hatfield
were
soon
wiped
away
in
the
pomps
and
enthusiasms
which
hailed
her
accession
to
the
throne
this
was
in
when
she
was
in
the
fulness
of
her
attractions
and
powers
great
expectations
were
formed
of
her
wisdom
and
genius
she
had
passed
through
severe
experiences
she
had
led
a
life
of
study
and
reflection
she
was
gifted
with
talents
and
graces
her
accomplishments
her
misfortunes
and
her
brilliant
youth
exalted
into
passionate
homage
the
principle
of
loyalty
and
led
to
extravagant
panegyrics
she
was
if
she
was
not
beautiful
since
the
expression
of
her
countenance
showed
benignity
culture
and
vivacity
she
had
piercing
dark
eyes
a
clear
complexion
and
animated
features
she
was
in
perfect
health
capable
of
great
fatigue
apt
in
business
sagacious
industrious
witty
learned
and
fond
of
being
surrounded
with
illustrious
men
she
was
in
her
sympathies
yet
a
protestant
in
the
breadth
of
her
views
and
in
the
fulness
of
her
reforms
above
all
she
was
patriotic
and
disinterested
in
her
efforts
to
develop
the
resources
of
her
kingdom
and
to
preserve
it
from
entangling
wars
the
kingdom
was
far
from
being
prosperous
when
elizabeth
assumed
the
reins
of
government
and
it
is
the
enormous
stride
in
civilization
which
england
made
during
her
reign
beset
with
so
many
perils
which
constitutes
her
chief
claim
to
the
admiration
of
mankind
let
it
be
borne
in
mind
that
she
began
her
rule
in
perplexities
anxieties
and
embarrassments
the
crown
was
encumbered
with
debts
the
nobles
were
ambitious
and
factious
the
people
were
poor
dispirited
unimportant
and
distracted
by
the
claims
of
two
hostile
religions
only
one
bishop
in
the
whole
realm
was
found
willing
to
crown
her
scotland
was
convulsed
with
factions
and
was
a
standing
menace
growing
out
of
the
marriage
of
mary
stuart
with
a
french
prince
barbarous
ireland
was
in
a
state
of
chronic
rebellion
france
spain
and
rome
were
decidedly
hostile
and
all
catholic
europe
aimed
at
the
overthrow
of
england
philip
ii
had
adopted
the
dying
injunction
of
his
father
to
extinguish
the
protestant
religion
and
the
princes
of
the
house
of
valois
were
leagued
with
rome
for
the
attainment
of
this
end
at
home
elizabeth
had
to
contend
with
a
jealous
parliament
a
factious
nobility
an
empty
purse
and
a
divided
people
the
people
generally
were
rude
and
uneducated
the
language
was
undeveloped
education
was
chiefly
confined
to
nobles
and
priests
the
poor
were
oppressed
by
feudal
laws
no
great
work
in
english
history
poetry
or
philosophy
had
yet
appeared
the
comforts
and
luxuries
of
life
were
scarcely
enjoyed
even
by
the
rich
chimneys
were
just
beginning
to
be
used
the
people
slept
on
mats
of
straw
they
ate
without
forks
on
pewter
or
wooden
platters
they
drank
neither
tea
nor
coffee
but
drank
what
their
ancestors
did
in
the
forests
of
germany
beer
their
houses
thatched
with
straw
were
dark
dingy
and
uncomfortable
commerce
was
small
manufactures
were
in
their
infancy
the
coin
was
debased
and
money
was
scarce
trade
was
in
the
hands
of
monopolists
coaches
were
almost
unknown
the
roads
were
impassable
except
for
horsemen
and
were
infested
with
robbers
only
the
rich
could
afford
wheaten
bread
agricultural
implements
were
of
the
most
primitive
kind
animal
food
for
the
greater
part
of
the
year
was
eaten
only
in
a
salted
state
enterprise
of
all
kinds
was
restricted
within
narrow
limits
beggars
and
vagrants
were
so
numerous
that
the
most
stringent
laws
were
necessary
to
protect
the
people
against
them
profane
swearing
was
nearly
universal
the
methods
of
executing
capital
punishments
were
revolting
the
rudest
sports
amused
the
people
the
parochial
clergy
were
ignorant
and
sensual
country
squires
sought
nothing
higher
than
it
took
several
days
for
letters
to
reach
the
distant
counties
the
population
numbered
only
four
millions
there
was
nothing
grand
and
imposing
in
art
but
the
palaces
of
nobles
and
the
gothic
monuments
of
mediaeval
europe
such
was
merrie
england
on
the
accession
of
elizabeth
to
the
throne
a
rude
nation
of
feudal
nobles
rural
squires
and
ignorant
people
who
toiled
for
a
mere
pittance
on
the
lands
of
cold
unsympathetic
masters
without
books
without
schools
without
privileges
without
rights
except
to
breathe
the
common
air
and
indulge
in
coarse
pleasures
and
religious
holidays
and
village
fêtes
on
the
other
hand
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
people
were
loyal
religious
and
brave
that
they
had
the
fear
of
god
before
their
eyes
and
felt
personal
responsibility
to
him
so
that
crimes
were
uncommon
except
among
the
lowest
and
most
abandoned
that
family
ties
were
strong
that
simple
hospitalities
were
everywhere
exercised
that
healthy
pleasures
stimulated
no
inordinate
desires
that
the
people
if
poor
had
enough
to
eat
and
drink
that
service
was
not
held
to
be
degrading
that
churches
were
not
deserted
that
books
what
few
there
were
did
not
enervate
or
demoralize
that
science
did
not
attempt
to
ignore
the
moral
government
of
god
that
laws
were
a
terror
to
that
philanthropists
did
not
seek
to
reform
the
world
by
mechanical
inventions
or
elevate
society
by
upholding
the
majesty
of
man
rather
than
the
majesty
of
god
teaching
the
infallibility
of
congregated
masses
of
ignorance
inexperience
and
conceit
even
in
those
rude
times
there
were
the
certitudes
of
religious
faith
of
domestic
endearments
of
patriotic
devotion
of
respect
for
parents
of
loyalty
to
rulers
of
kindness
to
the
poor
and
miserable
there
were
the
latent
fires
of
freedom
the
impulses
of
generous
enthusiasm
and
resignation
to
the
ills
which
could
not
be
removed
so
that
in
england
in
elizabeth
time
there
was
a
noble
material
for
christianity
and
art
and
literature
to
work
upon
and
to
develop
a
civilization
such
as
had
not
existed
previously
on
this
earth
a
civilization
destined
to
spread
throughout
the
world
in
new
institutions
inventions
laws
language
and
literature
binding
hostile
races
together
and
proclaiming
the
sovereignty
of
intelligence
the
greek
nous
kratei
of
the
old
ionian
philosophers
with
that
higher
sovereignty
which
moses
based
upon
the
ten
commandments
and
that
higher
law
still
which
jesus
taught
upon
the
mount
yet
with
all
this
fine
but
rude
material
for
future
greatness
it
was
nevertheless
a
glaring
fact
that
the
condition
of
england
on
the
accession
of
elizabeth
was
most
discouraging
a
poor
and
scattered
agricultural
nation
without
a
navy
of
any
size
without
a
regular
army
with
factions
in
every
quarter
with
struggling
and
contending
religious
parties
with
a
jealous
parliament
of
unenlightened
country
squires
yet
a
nation
seriously
threatened
by
the
most
powerful
monarchies
of
the
continent
who
detested
the
doctrines
which
were
then
taking
root
in
the
land
against
the
cabals
of
rome
the
navies
of
spain
and
the
armies
of
france
alike
hostile
and
dangerous
england
could
make
but
a
feeble
show
of
physical
forces
and
was
protected
only
by
her
insular
position
the
public
dangers
were
so
imminent
that
there
was
needed
not
only
a
strong
hand
but
a
stout
heart
and
a
wise
head
at
the
helm
excessive
caution
was
necessary
perpetual
vigilance
was
imperative
a
single
imprudent
measure
might
be
fatal
in
such
exigencies
and
this
accounts
for
the
vacillating
policy
of
elizabeth
so
often
condemned
by
historians
it
did
not
proceed
from
weakness
of
head
but
from
real
necessity
occasioned
by
constant
embarrassments
and
changing
circumstances
according
to
all
the
canons
of
expediency
it
was
the
sign
of
a
sagacious
ruler
to
temporize
and
promise
and
deceive
in
that
sad
perplexity
governments
thus
far
in
the
history
of
nations
have
been
carried
on
upon
different
principles
from
those
that
bind
the
conduct
of
individuals
especially
when
the
weak
contend
against
the
strong
this
abstractly
is
not
to
be
defended
governments
and
individuals
alike
are
bound
by
the
same
laws
of
immutable
morality
in
their
general
relations
but
the
rules
of
war
are
different
from
the
rules
of
peace
governments
are
expediencies
to
suit
peculiar
crises
and
exigencies
a
man
assaulted
by
robbers
would
be
a
fool
to
fall
back
on
the
passive
virtues
of
elizabeth
had
to
deal
both
with
religious
bigots
and
unscrupulous
kings
we
may
be
disgusted
with
the
course
she
felt
it
politic
to
pursue
but
it
proved
successful
a
more
generous
and
open
course
might
have
precipitated
an
attack
when
she
was
unprepared
and
defenceless
her
dalliances
and
expediencies
and
dissimulations
delayed
the
evil
day
until
she
was
ready
for
the
and
when
the
tempest
of
angry
human
forces
finally
broke
upon
her
defenceless
head
she
was
saved
only
by
a
storm
of
wind
and
rain
which
providence
kindly
and
opportunely
sent
had
the
invincible
armada
been
permitted
to
invade
england
at
the
beginning
of
her
reign
there
would
probably
have
been
another
spanish
conquest
what
chance
would
the
untrained
militia
of
a
scattered
population
without
fortresses
or
walled
cities
or
military
leaders
of
skill
have
had
against
the
veteran
soldiers
who
were
marshalled
under
philip
with
all
the
experiences
learned
in
the
wars
of
charles
and
in
the
conquest
of
peru
and
mexico
aided
too
by
the
forces
of
france
and
the
terrors
of
the
vatican
and
the
money
of
the
flemish
manufacturers
it
was
the
dictate
of
which
induced
elizabeth
to
prevaricate
and
to
deceive
the
powerful
monarchs
who
were
in
league
against
her
if
ever
lying
and
cheating
were
justifiable
they
were
then
if
political
jesuitism
is
ever
defensible
it
was
in
the
sixteenth
century
so
that
i
can
not
be
hard
on
the
embarrassed
queen
for
a
policy
which
on
the
strict
principles
of
morality
it
would
be
difficult
to
defend
it
was
a
dark
age
of
conspiracies
rebellions
and
cabals
in
dealing
with
the
complicated
relations
of
government
in
that
day
there
were
no
recognized
principles
but
those
of
expediency
even
in
our
own
times
expediency
rather
than
right
too
often
seems
to
guide
nations
it
is
not
just
and
fair
therefore
to
expect
from
a
sovereign
in
queen
elizabeth
time
that
openness
and
fairness
which
are
the
result
only
of
a
higher
national
civilization
what
would
be
blots
on
government
were
not
deemed
blots
in
the
sixteenth
century
elizabeth
must
be
judged
by
the
standard
of
her
age
not
of
ours
in
her
official
and
public
acts
we
must
remember
also
that
this
great
queen
was
indorsed
supported
and
even
instructed
by
the
ablest
and
wisest
and
most
patriotic
statesmen
that
were
known
to
her
generation
lord
burleigh
her
prime
minister
was
a
marvel
of
political
insight
industry
and
fidelity
if
he
had
not
the
commanding
genius
of
thomas
cromwell
or
the
ambitious
foresight
of
richelieu
he
surpassed
the
statesmen
of
his
day
in
patriotic
zeal
and
in
disinterested
labors
not
to
extend
the
boundaries
of
the
empire
but
to
develop
national
resources
and
make
the
country
strong
for
defence
he
was
a
plodding
wary
cautious
old
statesman
whose
opinions
it
was
not
safe
for
elizabeth
to
oppose
and
although
she
was
arbitrary
and
opinionated
herself
she
generally
followed
burleigh
counsels
unwillingly
at
times
but
firmly
when
she
perceived
the
necessity
for
she
was
with
all
her
pertinacity
open
to
conviction
of
reason
i
can
not
deny
that
she
sometimes
headed
off
her
and
deceived
him
and
otherwise
complicated
the
difficulties
that
beset
her
reign
but
this
was
only
when
she
felt
a
strong
personal
repugnance
to
the
state
measures
which
he
found
it
imperative
to
pursue
after
all
elizabeth
was
a
woman
and
the
woman
was
not
utterly
lost
in
the
queen
it
is
greatly
to
her
credit
however
that
she
retained
the
services
of
this
old
statesman
for
forty
years
and
that
she
filled
the
great
offices
in
the
state
and
church
with
men
of
experience
genius
and
wisdom
she
made
parker
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
a
man
of
remarkable
moderation
and
breadth
of
mind
whose
reforms
were
carried
on
without
exciting
hostilities
and
have
survived
the
fanaticisms
and
hostile
attacks
of
generations
walsingham
her
ambassador
at
paris
and
afterwards
her
secretary
of
state
ferreted
out
the
plots
of
the
jesuits
and
the
intrigues
of
hostile
courts
and
rendered
priceless
service
by
his
acuteness
and
diligence
lord
effingham
one
of
the
howards
defeated
the
invincible
armada
sir
thomas
gresham
managed
her
finances
so
ably
that
she
was
never
without
money
coke
was
her
attorney
sir
nicholas
bacon
the
ablest
lawyer
in
the
realm
and
a
stanch
protestant
was
her
while
his
illustrious
son
the
immortal
francis
bacon
though
not
adequately
rewarded
was
always
consulted
by
the
queen
in
great
legal
difficulties
i
say
nothing
of
those
elegant
and
gallant
men
who
were
the
ornaments
of
her
court
and
in
some
instances
the
generals
of
her
armies
and
admirals
of
her
navies
sackville
raleigh
sidney
not
to
mention
essex
and
leicester
all
of
whom
were
distinguished
for
talents
and
services
men
who
had
no
equals
in
their
respective
provinces
so
gifted
that
it
is
difficult
to
determine
whether
the
greatness
of
her
reign
was
more
owing
to
the
talents
of
the
ministers
or
to
the
wisdom
of
the
queen
herself
unless
she
had
been
a
great
woman
i
doubt
whether
she
would
have
discerned
the
merits
of
these
men
and
employed
them
in
her
service
and
kept
them
so
long
in
office
it
was
by
these
great
men
that
elizabeth
was
ruled
so
far
as
she
was
ruled
at
all
not
by
favorites
like
her
successors
james
and
charles
the
favorites
at
the
court
of
elizabeth
were
rarely
trusted
with
great
powers
unless
they
were
men
of
signal
abilities
and
regarded
as
such
by
the
nation
itself
while
she
lavished
favors
upon
them
sometimes
to
the
disgust
of
the
old
nobility
she
was
never
ruled
by
them
as
james
was
by
buckingham
and
louis
xv
by
madame
de
pompadour
elizabeth
was
not
above
coquetry
it
is
true
but
after
toying
with
leicester
and
raleigh
never
though
to
the
serious
injury
of
her
reputation
as
a
woman
she
would
retire
to
the
cabinet
of
her
ministers
and
yield
to
the
sage
suggestions
of
burleigh
and
walsingham
at
her
she
was
an
entirely
different
woman
from
what
she
was
among
her
courtiers
she
would
tolerate
no
flattery
and
was
controlled
only
by
reason
and
good
sense
as
practical
as
burleigh
himself
and
as
and
cold
intellectual
and
utterly
without
enthusiasm
perhaps
the
greatest
service
which
elizabeth
rendered
to
the
english
nation
and
the
cause
of
civilization
was
her
success
in
establishing
protestantism
as
the
religion
of
the
land
against
so
many
threatening
obstacles
in
this
she
was
aided
and
directed
by
some
of
the
most
enlightened
divines
that
england
ever
had
the
liturgy
of
cranmer
was
preferments
were
conferred
on
married
priests
the
learned
and
pious
were
raised
to
honor
eminent
scholars
and
theologians
were
invited
to
england
the
bible
was
revised
and
freely
circulated
and
an
alliance
was
formed
between
learning
and
religion
by
the
great
men
who
adorned
the
universities
though
inclined
to
ritualism
elizabeth
was
broad
and
even
moderate
in
reform
desiring
according
to
the
testimony
of
bacon
that
all
extremes
of
idolatry
and
superstition
should
be
avoided
on
the
one
hand
and
levity
and
contempt
on
the
other
that
all
church
matters
should
be
examined
without
sophistical
niceties
or
subtle
speculations
the
basis
of
the
english
church
as
thus
established
by
elizabeth
was
between
rome
and
geneva
a
compromise
i
admit
but
all
established
institutions
and
governments
accepted
by
the
people
are
based
on
compromise
how
can
there
be
even
family
government
without
some
compromise
inasmuch
as
husband
and
wife
can
not
always
be
expected
to
think
exactly
alike
at
any
rate
the
church
established
by
elizabeth
was
signally
adapted
to
the
wants
and
genius
of
the
english
people
evangelical
on
the
whole
in
its
creed
though
not
calvinistic
unobtrusive
in
its
forms
easy
in
its
discipline
and
aristocratic
in
its
government
subservient
to
bishops
but
really
governed
by
the
enlightened
few
who
really
govern
all
churches
independent
presbyterian
or
methodist
supported
by
the
state
yet
wielding
only
spiritual
authority
giving
its
influence
to
uphold
the
crown
and
the
established
institutions
of
the
country
conservative
yet
earnestly
protestant
in
the
sixteenth
century
it
was
the
church
of
reform
of
progress
of
advancing
and
liberalizing
thought
elizabeth
herself
was
a
zealous
protestant
protecting
the
cause
whenever
it
was
persecuted
encouraging
huguenots
and
not
disdaining
the
presbyterians
of
scotland
she
was
not
as
generous
to
the
protestants
of
holland
and
trance
as
we
could
have
wished
for
she
was
obliged
to
husband
her
resources
and
hence
she
often
seemed
parsimonious
but
she
was
the
acknowledged
head
of
the
reform
movement
in
europe
her
hostility
to
rome
and
roman
influence
was
inexorable
she
may
not
have
carried
reforms
as
far
as
the
puritans
desired
and
who
can
wonder
at
that
their
spirit
was
aggressive
revolutionary
bitter
and
pushed
to
its
logical
sequences
was
hostility
to
the
throne
itself
as
proved
by
their
whole
subsequent
history
until
cromwell
was
dead
and
this
hostility
burleigh
perceived
as
well
as
the
queen
which
doubtless
led
to
severities
that
our
age
can
not
pretend
to
justify
the
queen
did
dislike
and
persecute
the
puritans
not
i
think
so
much
because
they
made
war
on
the
surplice
liturgy
and
divine
right
of
bishops
as
because
they
were
at
heart
opposed
to
all
absolute
authority
both
in
state
and
church
and
when
goaded
by
persecution
would
hurl
even
kings
from
their
thrones
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
elizabeth
was
so
severe
on
those
who
differed
from
her
she
had
no
right
to
insist
on
uniformity
with
her
conscience
in
those
matters
which
are
above
any
human
authority
the
reformation
in
its
severest
logical
consequences
in
its
grandest
deductions
affirms
the
right
of
private
judgment
as
the
mighty
pillar
of
its
support
all
parties
presbyterian
as
well
as
episcopalian
sought
uniformity
they
only
differed
as
to
its
standard
with
the
queen
and
ministers
and
prelates
it
was
the
laws
of
the
land
with
the
puritans
the
decrees
of
provincial
and
national
synods
hence
if
elizabeth
insisted
that
her
subjects
should
conform
to
her
notions
and
the
ordinances
of
parliament
and
convocations
she
showed
a
spirit
which
was
universal
she
was
superior
even
in
toleration
to
all
contemporaneous
sovereigns
catholic
or
protestant
man
or
woman
contrast
her
persecutions
of
catholics
and
puritans
with
the
persecution
by
catherine
de
médicis
and
charles
ix
and
philip
ii
and
ferdinand
ii
or
even
with
that
under
the
regent
murray
of
scotland
when
churches
and
abbeys
were
ruthlessly
destroyed
contrast
her
archbishop
of
canterbury
with
the
religious
dictator
of
scotland
she
kindled
no
like
the
spaniards
she
incited
no
wholesale
massacre
like
the
demented
fury
of
france
she
had
a
loving
care
of
her
subjects
that
no
religious
bigotry
could
suppress
she
did
not
seek
to
exterminate
catholics
or
puritans
but
simply
to
build
up
the
church
of
england
as
the
shield
and
defence
and
enlargement
of
protestantism
in
times
of
unmitigated
religious
ferocity
a
protestantism
that
has
proved
the
bulwark
of
european
liberties
as
it
was
the
foundation
of
all
progress
in
england
in
giving
an
impulse
to
this
great
emancipating
movement
even
if
she
did
not
push
it
to
its
remote
logical
end
elizabeth
was
a
benefactor
of
her
country
and
of
mankind
and
is
not
unjustly
called
a
of
the
church
being
so
regarded
by
protestants
not
in
england
merely
but
on
the
continent
of
europe
when
was
ever
a
religious
revolution
effected
or
a
national
church
established
with
so
little
bloodshed
when
have
ever
such
great
changes
proved
so
popular
and
so
beneficial
and
i
may
add
so
permanent
after
all
the
revolutions
in
english
thought
and
life
for
three
hundred
years
the
church
as
established
by
elizabeth
is
still
dear
to
the
great
body
of
english
people
and
has
survived
every
agitation
and
even
many
things
which
the
puritans
sought
to
sweep
away
the
music
of
the
choir
organs
and
chants
even
the
holidays
of
venerated
ages
are
now
revived
by
the
descendants
of
the
puritans
with
ancient
ardor
showing
how
permanent
are
such
festivals
as
christmas
and
easter
in
the
heart
of
christendom
and
how
hopeless
it
is
to
eradicate
what
the
church
and
christianity
from
their
earliest
ages
have
sanctioned
and
commended
the
next
great
service
which
elizabeth
rendered
to
england
was
a
development
of
its
resources
ever
a
primal
effort
with
wise
statesmen
with
such
administrators
as
sully
colbert
richelieu
the
policy
of
her
government
was
not
the
policy
of
aggrandizement
in
war
which
has
ever
provoked
jealousies
and
hatreds
in
other
nations
and
led
to
dangerous
combinations
and
sowed
the
seed
of
future
wars
the
policy
of
napoleon
was
retaliated
in
the
conquests
of
prussia
in
our
day
and
the
policy
of
prussia
may
yet
lead
to
its
future
dismemberment
in
spite
of
the
imperial
realm
shaped
by
bismarck
with
what
measure
ye
mete
it
shall
be
measured
to
you
again
an
eternal
law
binding
both
individuals
and
nations
from
which
there
is
no
escape
the
government
of
elizabeth
did
not
desire
or
aim
at
foreign
conquests
the
great
error
of
european
statesmen
on
the
continent
it
sought
the
establishment
of
the
monarchy
at
home
and
the
development
of
the
various
industries
of
the
nation
since
in
these
industries
are
both
power
and
wealth
commerce
was
encouraged
and
she
girt
her
island
around
with
those
wooden
walls
which
have
proved
england
impregnable
defence
against
every
subsequent
combination
of
tyrants
and
conquerors
the
east
india
company
was
formed
and
the
fisheries
of
newfoundland
established
it
was
under
elizabeth
auspices
that
frobisher
penetrated
to
the
polar
sea
that
sir
francis
drake
circumnavigated
the
globe
that
sir
walter
raleigh
colonized
virginia
and
that
sir
humphrey
gilbert
attempted
to
discover
northwestern
passage
to
india
manufactories
were
set
up
for
serges
so
that
wool
was
no
longer
exported
but
the
raw
material
was
consumed
at
home
a
colony
of
flemish
weavers
was
planted
in
the
heart
of
england
the
prosperity
of
dyers
and
and
weavers
dates
from
this
reign
although
some
attempts
at
manufactures
were
made
in
the
reign
of
edward
iii
a
refuge
was
given
to
persecuted
foreigners
and
work
was
found
for
them
to
do
was
converted
to
tillage
not
as
is
now
the
case
to
parks
for
the
wealthy
classes
labor
was
made
respectable
and
enterprise
of
all
kinds
was
stimulated
wealth
was
sought
in
industry
and
economy
rather
than
in
mines
of
gold
and
silver
so
that
wealth
was
doubled
during
this
reign
and
the
population
increased
from
four
millions
to
six
millions
all
the
old
debts
of
the
crown
were
paid
both
principal
and
interest
and
the
debased
coin
was
called
in
at
a
great
sacrifice
to
the
royal
revenue
the
arbitrary
management
of
commerce
by
foreign
merchants
was
broken
up
and
weights
and
measures
were
duly
regulated
the
queen
did
not
revoke
monopolies
it
is
true
the
principles
of
political
economy
were
not
then
sufficiently
understood
but
even
monopolies
which
disgraced
the
old
roman
world
and
are
a
disgrace
to
any
age
were
not
so
gigantic
and
demoralizing
in
those
times
as
in
our
own
under
our
free
institutions
they
were
not
used
to
corrupt
legislation
and
bribe
judges
and
prevent
justice
but
simply
to
enrich
politicians
and
favorites
and
as
a
reward
for
distinguished
services
justice
in
the
courts
was
impartially
administered
there
was
security
to
property
and
punishment
for
crime
no
great
culprits
escaped
conviction
nor
when
convicted
were
they
allowed
to
purchase
with
their
stolen
wealth
the
immunities
of
freedom
the
laws
were
not
a
mockery
as
in
republican
borne
where
demagogues
had
the
ascendency
and
prepared
the
way
for
usurpation
and
tyranny
all
the
expenses
of
the
government
were
managed
economically
so
much
so
that
the
queen
herself
received
from
parliament
for
forty
years
only
an
average
grant
of
a
year
she
disliked
to
ask
money
from
the
commons
and
they
granted
subsidies
with
extreme
reluctance
the
result
was
that
between
the
two
the
greatest
economy
was
practised
and
the
people
were
not
by
taxation
elizabeth
hated
and
detested
war
as
the
source
of
all
calamities
and
never
embarked
upon
it
except
under
compulsion
all
her
wars
were
virtually
defensive
to
maintain
the
honor
safety
and
dignity
of
the
nation
she
did
not
even
seek
to
recover
calais
which
the
french
had
held
for
three
hundred
years
although
she
took
havre
to
gain
a
temporary
foothold
for
her
troops
she
did
not
strive
for
military
or
foreign
possessions
in
europe
feeling
that
the
strength
of
england
like
the
ancient
jewish
commonwealth
was
in
the
cultivation
of
the
peaceful
virtues
and
yet
she
made
war
when
it
became
imperative
she
gave
free
audience
to
her
subjects
paid
attention
to
all
petitions
and
was
indefatigable
in
business
she
made
her
own
glory
identical
with
the
prosperity
of
the
realm
and
if
she
did
not
rule
the
people
she
ruled
the
people
as
enlightened
and
patriotic
monarchs
ever
have
ruled
it
is
indisputable
that
the
whole
nation
loved
her
and
honored
her
to
the
last
even
when
disappointments
had
saddened
her
and
the
intoxicating
delusions
of
life
had
been
dispelled
she
bestowed
honors
and
benefits
with
frankness
and
cordiality
she
ever
sought
to
base
her
authority
on
the
affections
of
the
people
the
only
support
even
of
absolute
thrones
she
was
ever
ready
with
a
witticism
a
smile
and
a
pleasant
word
though
she
gave
vent
to
peevishness
and
irritability
when
crossed
and
even
would
swear
before
her
ministers
and
courtiers
in
private
yet
in
public
she
disguised
her
resentments
and
always
appeared
dignified
and
graceful
so
that
the
people
when
they
saw
her
majestic
manners
or
heard
her
loving
speeches
or
beheld
her
mounted
at
the
head
of
armies
or
shining
unrivalled
in
grand
festivals
or
listened
to
her
learning
on
public
occasions
such
as
when
she
extemporized
latin
orations
at
oxford
were
filled
with
pride
and
admiration
and
were
ready
to
expose
their
lives
in
her
service
the
characteristic
excellence
of
elizabeth
reign
as
it
seems
to
me
was
good
government
she
had
extraordinary
executive
ability
directed
to
all
matters
of
public
interest
her
government
was
not
marked
by
great
and
brilliant
achievements
but
by
perpetual
vigilance
humanity
economy
and
liberal
policy
there
were
no
destructive
and
wasting
wars
no
passion
for
military
glory
no
successions
of
court
follies
no
extravagance
in
no
egotistical
aims
and
pleasures
such
as
marked
the
reign
of
louis
which
cut
the
sinews
of
national
strength
impoverished
the
nobility
disheartened
the
people
and
sowed
the
seeds
of
future
revolution
that
modern
nebuchadnezzar
spent
on
one
palace
while
elizabeth
spent
on
all
her
palaces
processions
journeys
carriages
servants
and
dresses
a
year
she
was
indeed
fond
of
visiting
her
subjects
and
perhaps
subjected
her
nobles
to
a
burdensome
hospitality
but
the
earl
of
leicester
could
well
afford
three
hundred
and
hogsheads
of
beer
when
he
entertained
the
queen
at
kenilworth
since
he
was
rich
enough
to
fortify
his
castle
with
ten
thousand
men
nor
was
it
difficult
for
the
earl
of
derby
to
feast
the
royal
party
when
his
domestic
servants
numbered
two
hundred
and
forty
she
may
have
exacted
presents
on
her
birthday
but
the
courtiers
who
gave
her
laces
and
ruffs
and
jewelry
received
monopolies
in
return
the
most
common
charge
against
elizabeth
as
a
sovereign
is
that
she
was
arbitrary
and
tyrannical
nor
can
she
be
wholly
exculpated
from
this
charge
her
reign
was
despotic
so
far
as
the
constitution
would
allow
but
it
was
a
despotism
according
to
the
laws
under
her
reign
the
people
had
as
much
liberty
as
at
any
preceding
period
of
english
history
she
did
not
encroach
on
the
constitution
the
constitution
and
the
precedents
of
the
past
gave
her
the
star
chamber
and
the
high
commission
court
and
the
disposal
of
monopolies
and
the
absolute
command
of
the
military
and
naval
forces
but
these
great
prerogatives
she
did
not
abuse
in
her
direst
necessities
she
never
went
beyond
the
laws
and
seldom
beyond
the
wishes
of
the
people
it
is
expecting
too
much
of
sovereigns
to
abdicate
their
own
powers
except
upon
compulsion
and
still
more
to
increase
the
political
power
of
the
people
the
most
illustrious
sovereigns
have
never
parted
willingly
with
their
own
prerogatives
did
the
antonines
or
theodosius
or
charlemagne
or
the
emperor
of
russia
may
emancipate
serfs
from
a
dictate
of
humanity
but
he
did
not
give
them
political
power
for
fear
that
it
might
be
turned
against
the
throne
the
sovereign
people
of
america
may
give
political
equality
to
their
old
slaves
and
invite
them
to
share
in
the
legislation
of
great
interests
it
is
in
accordance
with
that
theory
of
abstract
rights
which
rousseau
the
creator
of
the
french
revolution
propounded
which
gospel
of
rights
was
accepted
by
jefferson
and
franklin
the
monarchs
of
the
world
have
their
own
opinions
about
the
political
rights
of
those
whom
they
deem
ignorant
or
inexperienced
instead
of
proceeding
to
enlarge
the
bounds
of
popular
liberties
they
prefer
to
fall
back
on
established
duties
elizabeth
had
this
preference
but
she
did
not
attempt
to
take
away
what
liberties
the
people
already
had
in
encouraging
the
principles
of
the
reformation
she
became
their
protector
against
catholic
priests
and
feudal
nobles
it
is
not
quite
just
to
stigmatize
the
government
of
elizabeth
as
a
despotism
a
despotism
is
a
régime
supported
by
military
force
based
on
an
army
with
power
to
tax
the
people
without
their
consent
like
the
old
rule
of
the
caesars
like
that
of
louis
xiv
and
peter
the
great
and
even
of
napoleon
now
elizabeth
never
had
a
standing
army
of
any
size
when
the
country
was
threatened
by
spain
she
threw
herself
into
the
arms
of
the
militia
upon
the
patriotism
and
generosity
of
her
people
nor
could
she
tax
the
people
without
the
consent
of
parliament
which
by
a
fiction
was
supposed
to
represent
the
people
while
in
reality
it
only
represented
the
wealthy
classes
parliament
possessed
the
power
to
cripple
her
and
was
far
less
generous
to
her
than
it
was
to
queen
victoria
she
was
headed
off
both
by
the
nobles
and
by
the
representatives
of
the
wealthy
powerful
and
aristocratic
commons
she
had
great
prerogatives
and
great
private
wealth
palaces
parks
and
arbitrary
courts
but
she
could
not
go
against
the
laws
of
the
realm
without
endangering
her
throne
which
she
was
wise
enough
and
strong
enough
to
keep
in
spite
of
all
her
enemies
both
at
home
and
abroad
had
she
been
a
man
she
might
have
turned
out
a
tyrant
and
a
usurper
she
might
have
increased
the
royal
prerogatives
like
richelieu
she
might
have
made
wars
like
louis
xiv
she
might
have
ground
down
the
people
like
her
successor
james
but
she
understood
the
limits
of
her
power
and
did
not
seek
to
go
beyond
thereby
proving
herself
as
wise
as
she
was
mighty
by
most
historical
writers
elizabeth
is
severely
censured
for
the
execution
of
mary
queen
of
scots
and
i
think
with
justice
i
am
not
making
a
special
plea
in
favor
of
elizabeth
hiding
her
defects
and
exaggerating
her
virtues
but
simply
seeking
to
present
her
character
and
deeds
according
to
the
verdict
of
enlightened
ages
it
was
a
cruel
and
repulsive
act
to
take
away
the
life
of
a
relative
and
a
woman
and
a
queen
under
any
pretence
whatever
unless
the
sparing
of
her
life
would
endanger
the
security
of
the
sovereign
and
the
peace
of
the
realm
mary
was
the
granddaughter
of
margaret
tudor
sister
of
henry
viii
and
was
the
lawful
successor
of
mary
the
eldest
daughter
of
henry
viii
on
the
principle
of
legitimacy
she
had
a
title
to
the
throne
superior
to
elizabeth
herself
and
the
succession
of
princes
has
ever
been
determined
by
this
but
mary
was
a
catholic
to
say
nothing
of
her
levities
or
crimes
and
had
been
excluded
by
the
nation
for
that
very
reason
if
there
was
injustice
done
to
her
it
was
in
not
allowing
her
claim
to
succeed
mary
that
she
felt
that
elizabeth
was
a
usurper
and
that
the
english
throne
belonged
by
right
to
her
i
do
not
doubt
it
was
natural
that
she
should
seek
to
regain
her
rights
if
she
should
survive
elizabeth
her
claims
as
the
rightful
successor
could
not
be
well
set
aside
that
in
view
of
these
facts
elizabeth
was
jealous
of
mary
i
do
not
doubt
and
that
this
jealousy
was
one
great
cause
of
her
hostility
is
probable
the
execution
of
mary
stuart
because
she
was
a
catholic
or
because
she
excited
fear
or
jealousy
is
utterly
indefensible
all
that
the
english
nation
had
a
right
to
do
was
to
set
her
succession
aside
because
she
was
a
catholic
and
would
undo
the
work
of
the
reformation
she
had
a
right
to
her
religion
and
the
nation
also
had
a
right
to
prevent
its
religion
from
being
overturned
or
jeopardized
i
do
not
believe
however
that
mary
life
endangered
either
the
throne
or
the
religion
of
england
so
long
as
she
was
merely
queen
of
scotland
hence
i
look
upon
her
captivity
as
cruel
and
her
death
as
a
crime
she
was
destroyed
as
the
male
children
of
the
hebrews
were
destroyed
by
pharaoh
as
a
sultan
murders
his
nephews
from
fear
from
a
cold
and
cruel
state
policy
against
all
the
higher
laws
of
morality
the
crime
of
elizabeth
doubtless
has
palliations
she
was
urged
by
her
ministers
and
by
the
protestant
part
of
the
nation
to
commit
this
great
wrong
on
the
plea
of
necessity
to
secure
the
throne
against
a
catholic
successor
and
the
nation
from
embarrassments
plots
and
rebellions
it
is
an
undoubted
fact
that
mary
even
after
her
imprisonment
in
england
was
engaged
in
perpetual
intrigues
that
she
was
leagued
with
jesuits
and
hostile
powers
and
kept
elizabeth
in
continual
irritation
and
the
nation
in
constant
alarm
and
it
is
probable
that
had
she
succeeded
elizabeth
she
would
have
destroyed
all
that
was
dear
to
the
english
heart
that
glorious
reformation
effected
by
so
many
labors
and
sacrifices
therefore
she
was
immolated
to
the
spirit
of
the
times
for
reasons
of
expediency
and
apparent
state
necessity
that
she
conspired
against
the
government
of
elizabeth
and
possibly
against
her
life
was
generally
supposed
that
she
was
a
bitter
enemy
can
not
be
questioned
how
far
elizabeth
can
be
exculpated
on
the
principle
of
can
not
well
be
ascertained
scotch
historians
do
not
generally
accept
the
reputed
facts
of
mary
guilt
but
if
she
sought
the
life
of
elizabeth
and
was
likely
to
attain
so
bloody
an
end
as
was
generally
feared
then
elizabeth
has
great
excuses
for
having
sanctioned
the
death
of
her
rival
so
the
beautiful
and
interesting
mary
dies
a
martyr
to
her
cause
a
victim
of
royal
and
national
jealousy
paying
the
penalty
for
alleged
crimes
against
the
state
and
throne
had
elizabeth
herself
during
the
life
of
her
sister
mary
been
guilty
of
half
they
proved
against
the
queen
of
scots
she
would
have
been
most
summarily
executed
but
elizabeth
was
wise
and
prudent
and
waited
for
her
time
mary
stuart
was
imprudent
and
rash
her
character
in
spite
of
her
fascinations
and
accomplishments
was
full
of
follies
infidelities
and
duplicities
she
is
supposed
to
have
been
an
adulteress
and
a
murderess
she
was
unfortunate
in
her
administration
of
scotland
she
was
ruled
by
wicked
favorites
and
foreign
influence
she
was
not
patriotic
or
lofty
or
earnest
she
did
what
she
could
to
root
out
protestantism
in
scotland
and
kept
her
own
realm
in
constant
trouble
she
had
winning
manners
and
graceful
accomplishments
she
was
doubtless
an
intellectual
woman
she
had
courage
presence
of
mind
tact
intelligence
she
could
ride
and
dance
well
but
with
these
accomplishments
she
had
qualities
which
made
her
dangerous
and
odious
if
she
had
not
been
executed
she
would
have
been
execrated
but
her
sufferings
and
unfortunate
death
appeal
to
the
heart
of
the
world
and
i
would
not
fight
against
popular
affections
and
sympathies
though
she
committed
great
crimes
and
follies
and
was
supposed
to
be
dangerous
to
the
religion
and
liberties
of
england
she
died
a
martyr
as
charles
died
and
louis
the
victim
of
great
necessities
and
great
animosities
the
execution
of
essex
is
another
of
the
popular
rather
than
serious
charges
against
elizabeth
he
had
been
her
favorite
he
was
a
generous
gifted
and
accomplished
man
therefore
it
is
argued
he
ought
to
have
been
spared
but
he
was
caught
with
arms
in
his
hands
he
was
a
traitor
to
the
throne
which
enriched
him
and
the
nation
which
flattered
him
he
was
at
the
head
of
foolish
rebellion
and
therefore
he
died
died
like
montmorency
in
the
reign
of
henry
like
bassompierre
like
norfolk
and
northumberland
because
he
had
committed
and
defied
the
laws
why
should
elizabeth
spare
such
a
culprit
no
former
friendship
no
chivalrous
qualities
no
array
of
past
services
ever
can
offset
the
crime
of
treason
and
rebellion
especially
in
unsettled
times
and
elizabeth
would
have
been
worse
than
weak
had
she
spared
so
great
a
criminal
both
according
to
the
laws
and
precedents
of
england
and
the
verdict
of
enlightened
civilization
we
may
compassionate
the
fate
of
essex
but
he
was
rash
giddy
and
irritated
and
we
feel
that
he
deserved
his
punishment
the
other
charges
brought
against
elizabeth
pertain
to
her
as
a
woman
rather
than
a
sovereign
they
say
that
she
was
artful
dissembling
parsimonious
jealous
haughty
and
masculine
very
likely
and
what
then
who
claimed
that
she
was
perfect
any
more
than
other
great
sovereigns
whom
on
the
whole
we
praise
these
faults
too
may
have
been
the
result
of
her
circumstances
rather
than
native
traits
of
character
surrounded
with
spies
and
enemies
she
was
obliged
to
hide
her
thoughts
and
her
plans
irritated
by
treason
and
rebellions
she
may
have
given
vent
to
unseemly
anger
flattered
beyond
all
example
she
may
have
been
vain
and
ostentatious
possessed
of
great
powers
she
may
have
been
arbitrary
crippled
by
parliament
she
may
have
nursed
her
resources
compelled
to
give
to
everything
she
may
have
been
parsimonious
slandered
by
her
enemies
she
may
have
been
resentful
annoyed
by
wrangling
sects
she
may
have
too
strenuously
paraded
her
principles
but
all
these
things
we
lose
sight
of
in
the
undoubted
virtues
abilities
and
services
of
this
great
queen
historians
have
other
work
than
to
pick
out
spots
on
the
sun
the
dark
spot
if
there
is
one
upon
elizabeth
character
was
her
coquetry
in
private
life
it
is
impossible
to
tell
whether
or
not
she
exceeded
the
bounds
of
womanly
virtue
she
was
probably
slandered
and
vilified
by
treacherous
gossiping
ambassadors
who
were
foes
to
her
person
and
her
kingdom
and
who
made
as
ugly
reports
of
her
as
possible
to
their
royal
masters
i
am
sorry
that
these
malicious
accusations
have
been
raked
out
of
the
ashes
of
the
past
by
modern
historians
whose
literary
fame
rests
on
bringing
to
light
what
is
rather
than
what
is
the
character
of
a
woman
and
a
queen
so
admired
and
honored
in
her
day
should
be
sacred
from
the
stings
of
sensational
writers
who
poison
their
darts
from
the
archives
of
bitter
foreign
enemies
the
gallant
men
of
genius
whom
elizabeth
admired
and
honored
as
a
bright
and
intellectual
woman
naturally
would
especially
when
deprived
of
the
felicities
of
wedded
life
never
presumed
i
have
charity
to
believe
beyond
an
undignified
partiality
and
an
admiring
friendship
when
essex
stood
highest
in
her
favor
she
was
nearly
seventy
years
of
age
there
are
no
undoubted
facts
which
criminate
her
nothing
but
gossip
and
the
malice
of
foreign
spies
what
a
contrast
her
private
life
was
to
that
of
her
mother
anne
boleyn
or
to
that
of
mary
queen
of
scots
or
even
to
that
of
the
great
catherine
of
russia
she
had
indeed
great
foibles
and
weaknesses
she
was
inordinately
fond
of
dress
she
was
sensitive
to
her
own
good
looks
she
was
jealous
of
pretty
women
she
was
vain
and
susceptible
to
flattery
she
was
irritable
when
crossed
she
gave
way
to
sallies
of
petulance
and
anger
she
occasionally
used
language
unbecoming
her
station
and
authority
she
could
dissimulate
and
hide
her
thoughts
but
her
nature
was
not
hypocritical
or
false
or
mean
she
was
just
honest
and
straightforward
in
her
ordinary
dealings
she
was
patriotic
enlightened
and
magnanimous
she
loved
learning
and
learned
men
she
had
at
heart
the
best
interests
of
her
subjects
she
was
true
to
her
cause
surely
these
great
virtues
which
it
is
universally
admitted
she
possessed
should
more
than
balance
her
defects
and
weaknesses
see
how
she
was
when
required
to
sign
and
what
grief
she
manifested
when
essex
proved
unworthy
of
her
friendship
see
her
love
of
children
her
readiness
of
sympathy
her
fondness
for
society
all
feminine
qualities
in
a
woman
who
is
stigmatized
as
masculine
as
she
perhaps
was
in
her
mental
structure
in
her
habits
of
command
and
aptitude
for
business
a
woman
at
the
worst
yet
such
a
woman
as
was
needed
on
a
throne
especially
in
stormy
times
and
in
a
rude
state
of
society
and
when
we
pass
from
her
private
character
to
her
public
services
by
which
the
great
are
judged
how
exalted
her
claims
to
the
regard
where
do
we
find
a
greater
or
a
better
queen
contrast
her
with
other
female
sovereigns
with
isabella
who
with
all
her
virtues
favored
the
inquisition
with
her
sister
mary
who
kindled
the
fires
of
smithfield
with
catherine
de
médicis
who
sounded
the
tocsin
of
bartholomew
with
mary
of
scotland
who
was
a
partner
in
the
murder
of
her
husband
with
anne
of
austria
who
ruled
through
italian
favorites
with
christiana
of
sweden
who
scandalized
europe
by
her
indecent
eccentricities
with
anne
of
great
britain
ruled
by
the
duchess
of
marlborough
there
are
only
two
great
sovereigns
with
whom
she
can
be
compared
catherine
ii
of
russia
and
maria
theresa
of
germany
illustrious
like
elizabeth
for
courage
and
ability
but
catherine
was
the
slave
of
infamous
passions
and
maria
theresa
was
a
party
to
the
partition
of
poland
compared
with
these
even
the
english
queen
appears
immeasurably
superior
they
may
have
wielded
more
power
but
their
moral
influence
was
less
it
is
not
the
greatness
of
a
country
which
gives
greatness
to
its
exalted
characters
washington
ruled
our
empire
in
its
infancy
and
buchanan
with
all
its
majestic
resources
yet
who
is
dearest
to
the
heart
of
the
world
no
countries
ever
produced
greater
benefactors
than
palestine
and
greece
when
their
limits
were
scarcely
equal
to
one
of
our
states
the
fame
of
burleigh
burns
brighter
than
that
of
the
most
powerful
of
modern
statesmen
the
names
of
alexander
hamilton
and
daniel
webster
may
outshine
the
glories
of
any
statesmen
who
shall
arise
in
this
great
country
for
a
hundred
years
to
come
elizabeth
ruled
a
little
island
but
her
memory
and
deeds
are
as
immortal
as
the
fame
of
pericles
or
marcus
aurelius
and
the
fame
of
england
great
queen
rests
on
the
influence
which
radiated
from
her
character
as
well
as
upon
the
power
she
wielded
with
so
much
wisdom
and
ability
influence
is
greater
than
power
in
the
lapse
of
ages
politicians
may
wield
power
for
a
time
but
the
great
statesmen
like
burke
and
canning
live
in
their
ideas
warriors
and
kings
and
ministers
of
kings
have
power
but
poets
and
philosophers
have
influence
for
their
ideas
go
coursing
round
the
world
until
they
have
changed
governments
and
institutions
for
better
or
for
worse
like
those
of
paul
of
socrates
of
augustine
of
dante
of
shakspeare
of
bacon
yea
of
rousseau
some
few
favored
rulers
and
leaders
of
men
have
had
both
power
and
influence
like
moses
alfred
and
washington
and
elizabeth
belongs
to
this
class
her
influence
was
for
good
and
it
permeated
english
life
and
society
like
that
of
victoria
whose
power
was
small
as
a
queen
however
more
than
a
woman
elizabeth
is
one
of
the
great
names
of
history
i
have
some
respect
for
the
critical
verdict
of
francis
bacon
the
greatest
man
of
his
age
if
we
except
shakspeare
and
one
of
the
greatest
men
in
the
history
of
all
nations
what
does
he
say
he
knew
her
well
perhaps
as
well
as
any
modern
historian
he
says
she
was
a
princess
that
if
plutarch
were
now
alive
to
write
by
parables
it
would
puzzle
him
to
find
her
equal
among
women
she
was
endowed
with
learning
most
singular
and
rare
and
as
for
her
government
i
do
affirm
that
england
never
had
years
of
better
times
and
this
not
through
the
calmness
of
the
season
but
the
wisdom
of
her
regimes
when
we
consider
the
establishment
of
religion
and
the
constant
peace
of
the
country
the
good
administration
of
justice
the
flourishing
state
of
learning
the
increase
of
wealth
and
the
general
prosperity
amid
differences
in
religion
the
troubles
of
neighboring
nations
the
ambition
of
spain
and
the
opposition
of
home
i
could
not
have
chosen
a
more
remarkable
combination
of
learning
in
the
prince
with
felicity
of
the
people
i
can
add
nothing
to
this
comprehensive
verdict
it
covers
the
whole
ground
so
that
for
virtues
and
abilities
in
spite
of
all
defects
i
challenge
attention
to
this
virgin
queen
i
love
to
dwell
on
her
courage
her
fortitude
her
prudence
her
wisdom
her
patriotism
her
magnanimity
her
executive
ability
and
more
on
the
exalted
services
she
rendered
to
her
country
and
to
civilization
these
invest
her
name
with
a
halo
of
glory
which
shall
blaze
through
all
the
ages
even
as
the
great
men
who
surrounded
her
throne
have
made
her
name
illustrious
the
elizabethan
era
is
justly
regarded
as
the
brightest
in
english
history
not
for
the
number
of
its
great
men
or
the
magnificence
of
its
great
enterprises
or
the
triumphs
of
its
great
discoveries
and
inventions
but
because
there
were
then
born
the
great
ideas
which
constitute
the
strength
and
beauty
of
our
proud
civilization
and
because
then
the
grandest
questions
which
pertain
to
religion
government
literature
and
social
life
were
first
agitated
with
the
freshness
and
earnestness
of
a
revolutionary
age
the
men
of
that
period
were
a
constellation
of
original
thinkers
we
still
point
with
admiration
to
the
political
wisdom
of
cecil
to
the
sagacity
of
walsingham
to
the
varied
accomplishments
of
raleigh
to
the
chivalrous
graces
of
sidney
to
the
bravery
of
hawkins
and
nottingham
to
the
bold
enterprises
of
drake
and
frobisher
to
the
mercantile
integrity
and
financial
skill
of
gresham
to
the
comprehensive
intellect
of
parker
to
the
scholarship
of
ascham
to
the
eloquence
of
jewel
to
the
profundity
of
hooker
to
the
vast
attainments
and
original
genius
of
bacon
to
the
rich
fancy
of
spenser
to
the
almost
inspired
insight
of
shakspeare
towering
above
all
the
poets
of
ancient
and
of
modern
times
as
fresh
as
he
was
three
hundred
years
ago
the
greatest
miracle
of
intellect
that
perhaps
has
ever
adorned
the
world
by
all
these
illustrious
men
queen
elizabeth
was
honored
and
beloved
all
received
no
small
share
of
their
renown
from
her
glorious
appreciation
all
were
proud
to
revolve
around
her
as
a
central
sun
giving
life
and
growth
to
every
great
enterprise
in
her
day
and
shedding
a
light
which
shall
gladden
unborn
generations
it
is
something
that
a
woman
has
earned
such
a
fame
and
in
a
sphere
which
has
been
supposed
to
belong
to
man
alone
and
if
men
shall
here
and
there
be
found
to
decry
her
greatness
let
no
woman
be
found
who
shall
seek
to
dethrone
her
from
her
lofty
pedestal
for
in
so
doing
she
unwittingly
becomes
a
detractor
from
that
womanly
greatness
in
which
we
should
all
rejoice
and
which
thus
far
has
so
seldom
been
seen
in
exalted
stations
for
my
part
the
more
i

the
more

ci
henry
of
navarre
the
huguenots
in
this
lecture
i
shall
confine
myself
principally
to
the
connection
of
henry
iv
with
that
memorable
movement
which
came
near
making
france
a
protestant
country
he
is
identified
with
the
huguenots
and
it
is
the
struggles
of
the
huguenots
which
i
wish
chiefly
to
present
i
know
he
was
also
a
great
king
the
first
of
the
bourbon
dynasty
whose
heroism
in
war
was
equalled
only
by
his
enlightened
zeal
in
the
civilization
of
france
a
king
who
more
deeply
impressed
himself
upon
the
affections
of
the
nation
than
any
monarch
since
saint
louis
and
who
had
he
lived
to
execute
his
schemes
would
have
raised
france
to
the
highest
pitch
of
glory
nor
do
i
forget
that
although
he
fought
for
a
great
cause
and
reigned
with
great
wisdom
and
ability
and
thus
rendered
important
services
to
his
country
he
was
a
man
of
great
defects
of
character
stained
with
those
peculiar
vices
which
disgraced
most
of
the
bourbon
kings
especially
louis
xiv
and
louis
xv
that
his
court
was
the
scene
of
female
gallantries
and
intrigues
and
that
he
was
more
under
the
influence
of
women
than
was
good
for
the
welfare
of
his
country
or
his
own
reputation
but
the
limits
of
this
lecture
will
not
permit
me
to
dwell
on
his
acts
as
a
monarch
or
on
his
statesmanship
his
services
or
his
personal
defects
of
character
i
am
obliged
from
the
magnitude
of
my
subject
and
from
the
necessity
of
giving
it
unity
and
interest
to
confine
myself
to
him
as
a
leader
of
the
huguenots
alone
it
is
not
henry
himself
that
i
would
consider
so
much
as
the
struggles
of
the
brave
men
associated
with
him
more
or
less
intimately
in
their
attempt
to
secure
religious
liberty
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
sixteenth
century
what
a
great
era
that
was
in
comparison
with
the
preceding
centuries
since
christianity
was
declared
from
a
religious
and
heroic
point
of
view
it
was
immeasurably
a
greater
period
than
the
nineteenth
century
which
has
been
marked
chiefly
for
the
triumphs
of
science
material
progress
and
social
and
political
reforms
but
in
earnestness
in
moral
grandeur
and
in
discussions
which
pertain
to
the
health
and
life
of
nations
the
sixteenth
century
was
greater
than
our
own
then
began
all
sorts
of
inquiries
about
nature
and
about
mind
about
revelation
and
providence
about
liberty
of
worship
and
freedom
of
thought
all
of
which
were
discussed
with
an
enthusiasm
and
patience
and
boldness
and
originality
to
which
our
own
times
furnish
no
parallel
and
united
with
this
fresh
and
original
agitation
of
great
ideas
was
a
heroism
in
action
which
no
age
of
the
world
has
equalled
men
risked
their
fortunes
and
their
lives
in
defence
of
those
principles
which
have
made
the
enjoyment
of
them
in
our
times
the
greatest
blessing
we
possess
it
was
a
new
spirit
that
had
arisen
in
our
world
to
break
the
fetters
which
centuries
of
fraud
and
superstition
and
injustice
had
forged
a
spirit
scornful
of
old
authorities
yet
not
sceptical
with
disgust
of
the
past
and
hope
for
the
future
penetrating
even
the
hamlets
of
the
poor
and
kindling
the
enthusiasm
of
princes
and
nobles
producing
learned
men
in
every
country
of
europe
whose
original
investigations
should
put
to
the
blush
the
commentators
and
compilers
of
this
age
of
religious
mediocrity
and
disguised
infidelity
such
intellectual
giants
in
the
field
of
religious
inquiry
had
not
appeared
since
the
fathers
of
the
church
combated
the
paganism
of
the
roman
world
and
will
not
probably
appear
again
until
the
cycle
of
changes
is
completed
in
the
domain
of
theological
thought
and
men
are
forced
to
meet
the
enemies
of
divine
revelation
marshalled
in
such
overwhelming
array
that
there
will
be
a
necessity
for
reformers
called
out
by
a
special
providence
to
fight
battles
as
i
regard
luther
and
calvin
and
knox
the
great
difference
between
the
sixteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
outside
of
material
aspects
is
that
the
former
recognized
the
majesty
of
god
and
the
latter
the
majesty
of
man
both
centuries
believed
in
progress
but
the
sixteenth
century
traced
this
progress
to
first
and
the
nineteenth
to
second
causes
the
sixteenth
believed
that
human
improvement
was
owing
directly
to
special
divine
grace
and
the
nineteenth
believes
in
the
necessary
development
of
mankind
the
school
of
the
sixteenth
century
was
spiritual
that
of
the
nineteenth
is
material
the
former
looked
to
heaven
the
latter
looks
to
earth
the
sixteenth
regarded
this
world
as
a
mere
preparation
for
the
next
and
the
nineteenth
looks
upon
this
world
as
the
future
scene
of
indefinite
and
completed
bliss
the
sixteenth
century
attacked
the
ancient
the
nineteenth
attacks
the
eternal
the
sixteenth
destroyed
but
reconstructed
the
nineteenth
also
destroys
but
would
substitute
nothing
instead
the
sixteenth
reminds
us
of
audacious
youth
still
clinging
to
parental
authority
the
nineteenth
reminds
us
of
cynical
and
irreverent
old
age
believing
in
nothing
but
the
triumphs
of
science
and
art
and
shaking
off
the
doctrines
of
the
ages
as
exploded
superstitions
the
sixteenth
century
was
marked
not
only
by
intensely
earnest
religious
inquiries
but
by
great
civil
and
social
disorders
showing
a
transition
period
of
society
from
the
slaveries
and
discomforts
of
the
feudal
ages
to
the
liberty
and
comforts
of
highly
civilized
life
in
the
midst
of
religious
enthusiasm
we
see
tumults
insurrections
terrible
animosities
and
cruel
intolerance
war
was
associated
with
inhuman
atrocities
and
the
acceptance
of
the
reformed
faith
was
followed
by
bitter
and
heartless
persecution
the
feudal
system
had
received
a
shock
from
standing
armies
and
the
invention
of
gunpowder
and
the
central
authority
of
kings
but
it
was
not
demolished
the
nobles
still
continued
to
enjoy
their
social
and
political
distinctions
the
peasantry
were
ground
down
by
unequal
laws
and
the
nobles
were
as
arrogant
and
quarrelsome
as
the
people
were
oppressed
by
unjust
distinctions
they
were
still
followed
by
their
armed
retainers
and
had
almost
unlimited
jurisdiction
in
their
respective
governments
even
the
higher
clergy
gloried
in
feudal
inequalities
and
were
selected
from
the
noble
classes
the
people
were
not
powerful
enough
to
make
combinations
and
extort
their
rights
unless
they
followed
the
standards
of
military
chieftains
arrayed
perhaps
against
the
crown
and
against
the
parliaments
we
see
no
popular
independent
political
movements
even
the
people
like
all
classes
above
them
were
firm
and
enthusiastic
in
their
religious
convictions
the
commanding
intellect
at
that
time
in
europe
was
john
calvin
a
frenchman
but
a
citizen
of
geneva
whom
we
have
already
seen
to
be
a
man
of
marvellous
precocity
of
genius
and
astonishing
logical
powers
combined
with
the
most
exhaustive
erudition
on
all
theological
subjects
his
admirers
claim
a
distinct
and
logical
connection
between
his
theology
and
civil
liberty
itself
i
confess
i
can
not
see
this
there
was
nothing
democratic
about
calvin
he
ruled
indeed
at
geneva
as
savonarola
did
in
florence
but
he
did
not
have
as
liberal
ideas
as
the
florentine
reformer
about
the
political
liberties
of
the
people
he
made
his
faith
the
dearest
thing
a
man
could
have
to
be
defended
unto
death
in
the
face
of
the
most
unrelenting
persecution
it
was
the
tenacity
to
defend
the
reformed
doctrines
of
which
next
to
luther
calvin
was
the
greatest
champion
which
kindled
opposition
to
civil
rulers
and
it
was
opposition
to
civil
rulers
who
proved
themselves
tyrants
which
led
to
the
struggle
for
civil
liberty
not
democratic
ideas
of
right
these
may
have
been
the
sequence
of
agitations
and
wars
but
not
their
animating
cause
like
the
ideas
of
rousseau
on
the
french
revolutionists
the
original
puritans
were
not
democratic
the
presbyterians
of
scotland
were
not
even
when
cromwell
led
the
armies
but
not
the
people
of
england
the
huguenots
had
no
aspirations
for
civil
rights
they
only
aspired
for
the
right
of
worshipping
god
according
to
the
dictates
of
conscience
there
was
nothing
popular
in
their
notions
of
government
when
henry
iv
headed
the
forces
of
the
huguenots
he
only
aimed
at
the
recognition
of
religious
rights
the
huguenots
never
rallied
around
popular
leaders
but
rather
under
the
standards
of
princes
and
nobles
fighting
for
the
right
of
worshipping
god
according
to
the
dictation
or
ideas
of
calvin
they
would
preserve
their
schools
their
churches
their
consistories
and
their
synods
they
would
be
unmolested
in
their
religious
worship
now
at
the
time
when
henry
iv
was
born
in
the
year
when
henry
ii
was
king
of
france
and
edward
vi
was
king
of
england
the
ideas
of
the
reformation
and
especially
the
doctrines
of
calvin
had
taken
a
deep
and
wide
hold
of
the
french
people
the
calvinists
as
they
were
called
were
a
powerful
party
in
some
parts
of
france
they
were
in
a
majority
more
than
a
third
of
the
whole
population
had
enthusiastically
accepted
the
reformed
doctrines
they
were
in
a
fair
way
toward
triumph
they
had
great
leaders
among
the
highest
of
the
nobility
but
they
were
bitterly
hated
by
the
king
and
the
princes
of
the
house
of
valois
and
especially
by
the
duke
of
guise
and
the
cardinal
of
lorraine
the
most
powerful
famlies
in
france
because
they
meditated
to
overturn
not
the
throne
but
the
old
established
religion
the
pope
instigated
the
most
violent
proceedings
so
did
the
king
of
spain
it
was
resolved
to
suppress
the
hated
doctrines
the
enemies
of
the
calvinists
resorted
to
intrigues
and
assassinations
they
began
a
furious
persecution
as
they
held
in
their
hands
the
chief
political
power
injustice
succeeded
injustice
and
outrage
followed
outrage
during
the
whole
reigns
of
the
valois
princes
treachery
assassinations
and
bloody
executions
marked
the
history
of
france
royal
edicts
forbid
even
the
private
assemblies
of
the
huguenots
on
pain
of
death
they
were
not
merely
persecuted
but
calumniated
there
was
no
crime
which
was
not
imputed
to
them
even
that
of
sacrificing
little
children
so
that
the
passions
of
the
people
were
aroused
against
them
and
they
were
so
maltreated
that
all
security
was
at
an
end
from
a
condition
of
hopeful
progress
they
were
forced
back
and
beaten
down
their
condition
became
insupportable
there
was
no
alternative
but
desperate
resistance
or
martyrdom
for
the
complete
suppression
of
protestantism
was
resolved
upon
on
the
part
of
the
government
the
higher
clergy
the
parliaments
the
university
of
paris
and
the
greater
part
of
the
old
nobility
supported
the
court
and
each
successive
prince
of
the
house
of
valois
adopted
more
rigorous
measures
than
his
predecessor
henry
ii
was
more
severe
than
francis
and
francis
ii
was
more
implacable
than
henry
who
was
killed
at
a
tournament
in
francis
a
feeble
prince
was
completely
ruled
by
his
mother
catherine
de
médicis
an
incarnated
fiend
of
cruelty
and
treachery
though
a
woman
of
pleasing
manners
and
graceful
accomplishments
like
mary
of
scotland
but
without
her
levities
under
her
influence
persecution
assumed
a
form
which
was
truly
diabolical
the
huguenots
although
supported
by
the
king
of
navarre
the
prince
of
condé
coligny
admiral
of
france
his
brother
the
seigneur
d
andelot
the
count
of
montgomery
the
duke
of
bouillon
the
duke
of
soubise
all
of
whom
were
nobles
of
high
rank
were
in
danger
of
being
absolutely
crushed
and
were
on
the
brink
of
despair
what
if
a
third
part
of
the
people
belonged
to
their
ranks
when
the
whole
power
of
the
crown
and
a
great
majority
of
the
nobles
were
against
them
and
these
supported
by
the
pope
and
clergy
and
stimulated
to
ferocity
by
the
jesuits
then
becoming
formidable
at
last
the
huguenots
resolved
to
organize
and
arm
in
their
own
defence
for
there
is
a
time
when
submission
ceases
to
be
a
virtue
if
ever
a
people
had
cause
for
resistance
it
was
this
persecuted
people
they
did
not
rise
up
against
their
persecutors
with
the
hope
of
overturning
the
throne
or
producing
a
change
of
dynasties
or
gaining
constitutional
liberty
or
becoming
a
political
power
hostile
to
the
crown
like
the
puritans
under
cromwell
or
hampden
but
simply
to
preserve
what
to
them
was
more
precious
than
life
all
that
they
demanded
was
a
toleration
of
their
religion
and
as
their
religion
was
dearer
to
them
than
life
they
were
ready
to
undergo
any
sacrifices
their
resistance
was
more
formidable
than
was
anticipated
they
got
possession
of
cities
and
fortresses
and
were
able
to
defy
the
whole
power
of
the
crown
it
was
found
impossible
to
suppress
a
people
who
fought
with
so
much
heroism
and
who
defied
every
combination
so
truces
and
treaties
were
made
with
them
by
which
their
religious
rights
were
guaranteed
but
these
treaties
were
perpetually
broken
for
treachery
is
no
sin
with
religious
persecutors
since
the
end
justified
the
means
this
huguenotic
contest
attended
with
so
much
vicissitude
alternate
defeat
and
victory
and
stained
by
horrid
atrocities
was
at
its
height
when
henry
iv
was
a
boy
and
had
no
thought
of
ever
being
king
of
france
his
father
antoine
de
bourbon
although
king
of
navarre
and
a
prince
of
the
blood
being
a
lineal
descendant
from
saint
louis
was
really
only
a
great
noble
not
so
powerful
as
the
duke
of
guise
or
the
duke
of
montmorency
and
even
he
a
leader
of
the
rebellion
was
finally
won
over
to
the
court
party
by
the
seductions
brought
to
bear
on
him
by
roman
priests
he
was
either
bribed
or
intimidated
and
disgracefully
abjured
the
cause
for
which
he
at
first
gallantly
fought
he
died
from
a
wound
he
received
at
the
siege
of
rouen
while
commanding
one
of
the
armies
of
charles
who
succeeded
his
brother
francis
in
the
mother
of
the
young
prince
destined
afterwards
to
be
so
famous
was
one
of
the
most
celebrated
women
of
history
jeanne
niece
of
francis
l
a
woman
who
was
equally
extolled
by
men
of
letters
and
calvinistic
divines
she
was
as
beautiful
as
she
was
good
at
her
castle
in
pau
the
capital
of
her
hereditary
kingdom
of
navarre
she
diffused
a
magnificent
hospitality
especially
to
scholars
and
the
lights
of
the
reformed
doctrines
her
kingdom
was
small
and
was
politically
unimportant
but
she
was
a
sovereign
princess
nevertheless
the
management
of
the
young
prince
her
son
was
most
admirable
but
unusual
he
was
delicate
and
sickly
as
an
infant
and
reared
with
difficulty
but
though
a
prince
he
was
fed
on
the
simplest
food
and
exposed
to
hardships
like
the
sons
of
peasants
he
was
allowed
to
run
bareheaded
and
barefooted
exposed
to
heat
and
rain
in
order
to
strengthen
his
constitution
amid
the
hills
at
the
base
of
the
pyrenees
in
the
company
of
peasants
children
he
thus
acquired
simple
and
natural
manners
and
accustomed
himself
to
fatigues
and
dangers
he
was
educated
in
the
reformed
doctrines
but
was
more
distinguished
as
a
boy
for
his
chivalric
graces
physical
beauty
and
manly
sports
than
for
seriousness
of
character
or
a
religious
life
he
grew
up
a
protestant
from
education
rather
than
conviction
at
twelve
in
the
year
he
was
intrusted
by
his
mother
the
queen
of
navarre
to
the
care
of
his
uncle
the
prince
of
condé
and
on
his
death
to
admiral
coligny
the
acknowledged
leader
of
the
protestants
he
thus
witnessed
many
bloody
battles
before
he
was
old
enough
to
be
intrusted
with
command
at
eighteen
he
was
affianced
to
marguerite
de
valois
sister
of
charles
in
spite
of
differences
of
religion
it
was
amid
the
nuptial
festivities
of
the
young
king
of
navarre
his
mother
had
died
the
year
before
when
all
the
prominent
leaders
of
the
protestants
were
enticed
to
paris
that
preparations
were
made
for
the
blackest
crime
in
the
annals
of
civilized
nations
even
the
treacherous
and
hideous
massacre
of
bartholomew
perpetrated
by
charles
who
was
incited
to
it
by
his
mother
the
catherine
de
médicis
and
the
duke
of
guise
the
protestants
under
the
prince
of
condé
and
admiral
coligny
had
fought
so
bravely
and
so
successfully
in
defence
of
their
cause
that
all
hope
of
subduing
them
in
the
field
was
given
up
the
bloody
battles
of
montcontour
of
denis
and
of
jarnac
had
proved
how
stubbornly
the
huguenots
would
fight
while
their
possession
of
such
strong
fortresses
as
montauban
and
la
rochelle
deemed
impregnable
showed
that
they
could
not
easily
be
subdued
although
the
prince
of
condé
had
been
slain
at
the
battle
of
jarnac
this
great
misfortune
to
the
protestants
was
more
than
balanced
by
the
assassination
of
the
great
duke
of
guise
the
ablest
general
and
leader
of
the
catholics
so
when
all
hope
had
vanished
of
exterminating
the
huguenots
in
open
warfare
a
deceitful
peace
was
made
and
their
leaders
were
decoyed
to
paris
in
order
to
accomplish
in
one
foul
sweep
by
wholesale
murder
the
diabolical
design
the
huguenot
leaders
were
completely
deceived
old
admiral
coligny
with
his
deeper
insight
hesitated
to
put
himself
into
the
power
of
a
bigoted
and
persecuting
monarch
but
charles
ix
pledged
his
word
for
his
safety
and
in
an
age
when
chivalry
was
not
extinguished
his
promise
was
accepted
who
could
believe
that
his
word
of
honor
would
be
broken
or
that
he
a
king
could
commit
such
an
outrageous
and
unprecedented
crime
but
what
oath
what
promise
what
law
can
bind
a
man
who
is
a
slave
of
religious
bigotry
when
his
church
requires
a
bloody
and
a
cruel
act
the
end
seemed
to
justify
any
means
i
would
not
fix
the
stain
of
that
infamous
crime
exclusively
on
the
jesuits
or
on
the
pope
or
on
the
councillors
of
the
king
or
on
his
mother
i
will
not
say
that
it
was
even
exclusively
a
church
movement
it
may
have
been
equally
an
apparent
state
necessity
a
protestant
prince
might
mount
the
throne
of
france
and
with
him
perhaps
the
ascendency
of
protestantism
or
at
least
its
protection
such
a
catastrophe
as
it
seemed
to
the
councillors
of
charles
must
somehow
be
averted
how
could
it
be
averted
otherwise
than
by
the
assassination
of
henry
himself
and
his
cousin
condé
and
the
brave
old
admiral
as
powerful
as
guise
as
courageous
as
du
gueslin
and
as
pious
as
godfrey
and
then
when
these
leaders
were
removed
and
all
the
protestants
in
paris
were
murdered
who
would
remain
to
continue
the
contest
and
what
protestant
prince
could
hope
to
mount
the
throne
but
whoever
was
directly
responsible
for
the
crime
and
whatever
may
have
been
the
motives
for
it
still
it
was
committed
the
first
victim
was
coligny
himself
and
the
slaughter
of
sixty
thousand
persons
followed
in
paris
and
the
provinces
the
admiral
coligny
marquis
of
chatillon
was
one
of
the
finest
characters
in
all
history
brave
honest
truthful
sincere
with
deep
religious
convictions
and
great
ability
as
a
general
no
englishman
in
the
sixteenth
century
can
be
compared
with
him
for
influence
heroism
and
virtue
combined
it
was
deemed
necessary
to
remove
this
illustrious
man
not
because
he
was
personally
obnoxious
but
because
he
was
the
leader
of
the
protestant
party
it
is
said
that
as
the
fatal
hour
approached
to
give
the
signal
for
the
meditated
massacre
the
king
appeared
irresolute
and
disheartened
though
cruel
perfidious
and
weak
he
shrank
from
committing
such
a
gigantic
crime
and
this
too
in
the
face
of
his
royal
promises
but
there
was
one
person
whom
no
dangers
appalled
and
whose
icy
soul
could
be
moved
by
no
compassion
and
no
voice
of
conscience
at
midnight
catherine
entered
the
chamber
of
her
irresolute
son
in
the
louvre
on
whose
brow
horror
was
already
stamped
and
whose
frame
quivered
with
troubled
chills
coloring
the
crime
with
the
usual
sophistries
of
all
religious
and
political
persecution
that
the
end
justifies
the
means
and
stigmatizing
him
as
a
coward
she
at
last
extorted
from
his
quivering
lips
the
fatal
order
and
immediately
the
tocsin
of
death
sounded
from
the
great
bell
of
the
church
of
germain
de
auxerrois
at
once
the
slaughter
commenced
in
every
corner
of
paris
so
well
were
the
horrid
measures
concerted
screams
of
despair
were
mingled
with
shouts
of
vengeance
the
cries
of
the
murdered
were
added
to
the
imprecations
of
the
murderers
the
streets
flowed
with
blood
the
dead
rained
from
the
windows
the
seine
became
purple
men
women
and
children
were
seen
flying
in
every
direction
pursued
by
soldiers
who
were
told
that
an
insurrection
of
protestants
had
broken
out
no
sex
or
age
or
dignity
was
spared
no
retreat
afforded
a
shelter
not
even
the
churches
of
the
catholics
neither
alaric
nor
attila
ever
inflicted
such
barbarities
no
besieged
city
taken
by
assault
ever
saw
such
wanton
butcheries
except
possibly
jerusalem
when
taken
by
titus
or
godfrey
or
magdeburg
when
taken
by
tilly
and
as
the
bright
summer
sun
illuminated
the
city
on
a
sunday
morning
the
massacre
had
but
just
begun
nor
for
three
days
and
three
nights
did
the
slaughter
abate
a
vulgar
butcher
appeared
before
the
king
and
boasted
he
had
slain
one
hundred
and
fifty
persons
with
his
own
hand
in
a
single
night
for
seven
days
was
paris
the
scene
of
disgraceful
murder
and
pillage
and
violence
men
might
be
seen
stabbing
little
infants
and
even
children
were
known
to
slaughter
their
companions
nor
was
there
any
escape
from
these
atrocities
the
very
altars
which
had
once
protected
christians
from
pagans
were
polluted
by
catholic
executioners
ladies
jested
with
unfeeling
mirth
over
the
dead
bodies
of
murdered
protestants
the
very
worst
horrors
of
which
the
mind
could
conceive
were
perpetrated
in
the
name
of
religion
and
then
when
no
more
victims
remained
the
king
and
his
court
and
his
clergy
proceeded
in
solemn
procession
to
the
cathedral
church
of
notre
dame
amidst
hymns
of
praise
to
return
thanks
to
god
for
the
deliverance
of
france
from
men
who
had
sought
only
the
privilege
of
worshipping
him
according
to
their
consciences
nor
did
the
bloody
work
stop
here
orders
were
sent
by
the
government
to
every
city
and
town
of
france
to
execute
the
like
barbarities
the
utter
extermination
of
the
protestants
was
resolved
upon
throughout
the
country
the
slaughter
was
begun
in
treachery
and
was
continued
in
the
most
heartless
cruelty
when
the
news
of
it
reached
borne
the
holy
father
the
pope
caused
a
medal
to
be
struck
in
commemoration
of
the
event
illuminated
his
capital
ordained
general
rejoicings
as
if
for
some
signal
victory
over
the
turks
and
assisted
by
his
cardinals
and
clergy
marched
in
glad
procession
to
peter
church
and
offered
up
a
solemn
te
deum
for
this
vile
and
treacherous
slaughter
of
sixty
thousand
protestants
in
former
lectures
i
have
passed
rapidly
and
imperfectly
over
this
awful
crime
not
wishing
to
stimulate
passions
which
should
be
buried
and
thinking
it
was
more
the
fault
of
the
age
than
of
catholic
bigots
but
i
now
present
it
in
its
naked
deformity
to
be
true
to
history
and
to
show
how
cruel
is
religious
intolerance
confirmed
by
the
history
of
other
inhumanities
in
the
catholic
church
by
the
persecution
of
dominican
monks
by
the
slaughter
of
the
albigenses
by
inquisitions
gunpowder
plots
the
cruelties
of
alva
and
that
trail
of
blood
which
has
marked
the
fairest
portions
of
europe
by
the
hostilities
of
the
church
of
borne
in
its
struggles
to
suppress
protestant
opinions
i
mention
it
to
recall
the
fact
that
protestantism
has
never
been
stained
by
such
a
crime
i
mention
it
to
invoke
gratitude
that
such
a
misguided
zeal
has
passed
away
and
is
never
likely
to
return
catholic
historians
do
not
pretend
to
deny
the
horrid
facts
but
ascribe
the
massacre
to
political
animosities
rather
than
religious
a
lame
and
impotent
defence
of
their
persecuting
church
in
the
sixteenth
century
but
this
atrocity
had
such
a
demoniacal
blackness
and
perfidy
about
it
that
it
filled
the
whole
protestant
world
with
grief
and
indignation
especially
england
and
had
only
the
effect
of
binding
together
the
huguenots
in
a
solid
phalanx
of
warriors
resolved
on
making
no
peace
with
their
perfidious
enemies
until
their
religious
liberties
were
guaranteed
though
decimated
they
were
not
destroyed
for
the
provincial
governors
and
rural
magistrates
generally
refused
to
execute
the
royal
decrees
their
hearts
were
moved
with
pity
the
slaughter
was
not
universal
and
henry
himself
had
escaped
his
life
being
spared
on
condition
of
his
becoming
a
catholic
which
as
a
matter
of
form
he
did
nevertheless
all
protestant
eyes
were
now
directed
to
him
as
their
leader
since
coligny
had
perished
by
daggers
and
condé
on
the
field
of
battle
henry
was
still
a
young
man
only
twenty
years
of
age
but
able
intrepid
and
wise
he
and
his
cousin
the
younger
condé
were
still
held
as
hostages
while
the
huguenots
again
rallied
and
retired
to
their
strong
fortress
of
la
rochelle
their
last
hopes
centred
in
this
fortress
defended
by
only
fifteen
thousand
men
under
the
brave
la
none
while
the
royal
army
embraced
the
flower
of
the
french
nobility
commanded
by
the
dukes
of
anjou
and
alençon
but
these
royal
dukes
were
compelled
to
raise
the
siege
with
a
loss
of
forty
thousand
men
i
regard
the
successful
defence
of
this
fortress
at
this
crisis
as
the
most
fortunate
event
in
the
whole
huguenot
contest
since
it
enabled
the
huguenots
to
make
a
stand
against
the
whole
power
of
the
monarchs
it
did
not
give
them
victory
but
gave
them
a
place
to
rally
and
it
proclaimed
the
fact
that
the
contest
would
not
end
until
the
protestants
had
achieved
their
liberties
or
were
utterly
annihilated
soon
after
this
successful
and
glorious
defence
of
la
rochelle
charles
ix
died
at
the
age
of
in
awful
agonies
the
victim
of
remorse
and
partial
insanity
in
the
hours
of
which
the
horrors
of
bartholomew
were
ever
present
to
his
excited
imagination
and
when
he
beheld
wild
faces
of
demons
and
murdered
huguenots
rejoicing
in
his
torments
and
heard
strange
voices
consigning
his
name
to
infamy
and
his
body
to
those
physical
torments
in
which
both
catholics
and
protestants
equally
believed
his
mother
however
remained
cold
inflexible
and
unmoved
for
when
a
woman
falls
under
the
grip
of
the
devil
then
no
man
can
equal
her
in
shamelessness
and
reckless
sin
charles
ix
was
succeeded
in
by
his
brother
the
king
of
poland
under
the
name
of
henry
who
was
equally
under
the
control
of
his
mother
catherine
two
years
afterward
the
king
of
navarre
succeeded
in
making
his
escape
and
joined
the
huguenot
army
at
tours
he
was
now
he
astonished
the
whole
kingdom
by
his
courage
and
intrepidity
winning
the
hearts
of
the
soldiers
and
uniting
them
by
strict
military
discipline
his
friend
and
counsellor
was
rosny
afterwards
duke
of
sully
to
whose
wise
counsels
his
future
success
may
be
in
a
great
measure
traced
fortunate
is
the
prince
who
will
listen
to
frank
and
disagreeable
advice
and
that
was
one
of
the
virtues
of
henry
a
magnanimity
which
has
seldom
been
equalled
by
generals
the
huguenots
were
now
able
to
make
a
stand
in
the
open
country
partly
from
additions
to
their
numbers
and
partly
from
the
mistakes
and
frivolities
of
henry
who
alienated
stern
catholics
and
his
best
friends
it
was
then
that
bouillon
father
of
the
illustrious
turenne
joined
the
standard
of
henry
of
navarre
soon
after
this
henry
became
of
the
french
throne
by
the
death
of
the
duke
of
alençon
only
the
king
henry
a
man
without
children
and
the
last
of
the
male
line
of
the
house
of
valois
stood
between
henry
of
navarre
and
the
throne
the
possibility
that
he
a
protestant
might
wield
the
sceptre
of
saint
louis
his
ancestor
increased
the
bitterness
and
animosity
of
the
catholics
all
the
forces
which
the
government
could
raise
were
now
arrayed
against
him
and
his
party
the
pope
sixtus
in
a
papal
bull
took
away
his
hereditary
rights
but
fortune
favored
him
the
duke
of
guise
who
aspired
to
the
throne
was
himself
assassinated
as
his
father
had
been
and
now
by
the
orders
of
his
jealous
sovereign
his
brother
the
cardinal
of
guise
nephew
of
the
cardinal
of
lorraine
a
man
who
held
three
archbishoprics
six
bishoprics
and
five
abbeys
and
these
the
richest
in
the
kingdom
shared
the
same
fate
and
providence
removed
also
soon
after
the
most
guilty
and
wicked
of
all
the
perpetrators
of
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
even
catherine
de
médicis
who
would
be
regarded
as
a
female
monster
an
incarnate
fiend
a
messalina
or
a
fredegunda
had
she
not
been
beautiful
with
pleasing
and
gracious
manners
a
great
fondness
for
society
and
music
and
poetry
and
art
the
most
accomplished
woman
of
her
day
and
so
attractive
as
to
be
compared
by
the
poets
of
her
court
to
aurora
and
venus
her
life
only
shows
how
much
heartlessness
cruelty
malignity
envy
and
selfishness
may
be
concealed
by
the
mask
of
beauty
and
agreeable
manners
and
artistic
accomplishments
the
bloody
battle
of
coutras
enabled
henry
of
navarre
to
take
a
stand
against
the
catholics
but
after
the
death
of
henry
iii
by
assassination
in
his
struggles
for
the
next
five
years
were
more
to
secure
his
hereditary
rights
as
king
of
france
than
to
lead
the
huguenots
to
victory
as
a
religious
body
it
might
have
been
better
for
them
had
henry
remained
the
head
of
their
party
rather
than
become
king
of
france
since
he
might
not
have
afterwards
deserted
them
but
there
was
really
no
hope
of
the
huguenots
gaining
a
political
ascendency
at
any
time
they
composed
but
a
third
part
of
the
nation
their
only
hope
was
to
secure
their
religious
liberties
the
most
brilliant
part
of
the
military
career
of
henry
iv
was
when
he
struggled
for
his
throne
supported
of
course
by
the
huguenots
and
opposed
by
the
whole
catholic
party
the
king
of
spain
and
the
pope
of
rome
the
catholics
or
the
leaguers
as
they
were
called
were
led
by
the
duke
of
mayenne
i
need
not
describe
the
successes
of
henry
until
the
battle
of
ivry
march
made
him
really
the
monarch
of
france
on
that
eventful
day
both
armies
having
performed
their
devotions
were
drawn
out
for
action
both
armies
knew
that
this
battle
would
be
decisive
and
when
all
the
arrangements
were
completed
henry
completely
covered
with
mail
except
his
hands
and
head
mounted
upon
a
great
bay
charger
galloped
up
and
down
the
ranks
giving
words
of
encouragement
to
his
soldiers
and
assuring
them
that
he
would
either
conquer
or
die
if
my
standard
fail
you
said
he
keep
my
plume
in
sight
you
will
always
see
it
in
the
face
of
glory
and
honor
so
saying
he
put
on
his
helmet
adorned
with
three
white
plumes
gave
the
order
of
battle
and
sword
in
hand
led
the
charge
against
the
enemy
for
some
time
the
issue
of
the
conflict
was
doubtful
for
the
forces
were
about
equal
but
at
length
victory
inclined
to
the
protestants
who
broke
forth
in
shouts
as
henry
covered
with
dust
and
blood
appeared
at
the
head
of
the
pursuing
squadrons
now
god
be
praised
the
day
is
ours
mayenne
hath
turned
his
rein
hath
cried
for
quarter
the
flemish
count
is
slain
their
ranks
are
breaking
like
thin
clouds
before
a
biscay
gale
the
field
is
heaped
with
bleeding
steeds
and
flags
and
cloven
mail
and
then
we
thought
on
vengeance
and
all
along
our
van
bartholomew
was
passed
from
man
to
man
but
out
spake
gentle
henry
then
frenchman
is
my
foe
down
down
with
every
foreigner
but
let
your
brethren
go
oh
was
there
ever
such
a
knight
in
friendship
or
in
war
as
our
sovereign
lord
king
henry
the
soldier
of
navarre
the
battle
of
ivry
in
which
the
forces
of
the
league
met
with
a
complete
overthrow
was
followed
by
the
siege
of
paris
its
memorable
defence
and
the
arrival
of
the
duke
of
parma
which
compelled
henry
to
retire
though
he
had
gained
a
great
victory
and
received
great
accessions
he
had
to
struggle
four
years
longer
so
determined
were
the
catholics
and
he
might
have
had
to
fight
a
still
longer
time
for
his
throne
had
he
not
taken
the
extraordinary
resolution
of
abjuring
his
religion
and
cause
his
final
success
was
not
doubtful
even
as
a
protestant
king
since
his
title
was
undisputed
but
he
wearied
of
war
the
peace
of
the
kingdom
and
the
security
of
the
throne
seemed
to
him
a
greater
good
than
the
triumph
of
the
huguenots
in
that
age
great
power
was
given
to
princes
he
doubtless
could
have
reigned
as
a
protestant
prince
had
he
persevered
for
a
few
years
longer
and
protestantism
would
have
been
the
established
religion
of
france
as
it
was
of
england
under
elizabeth
henry
as
a
protestant
king
would
have
had
no
more
enemies
or
difficulties
or
embarrassments
than
had
the
virgin
queen
who
on
her
accession
found
only
one
bishop
willing
to
crown
her
he
had
all
the
prestige
of
a
conqueror
and
was
personally
beloved
besides
being
a
man
of
ability
his
prime
minister
sully
was
as
able
a
man
as
burleigh
and
as
good
a
protestant
and
the
nation
was
enthusiastic
the
huguenots
had
deeper
convictions
and
were
more
logical
in
their
creed
than
the
english
episcopalians
leagued
with
england
and
holland
and
germany
france
could
have
defied
other
catholic
powers
could
have
been
more
powerful
politically
protestantism
would
have
had
the
ascendency
in
europe
but
it
was
not
to
be
to
the
mind
of
the
king
he
had
nothing
before
him
but
protracted
war
unless
he
became
a
catholic
and
as
all
the
huguenots
ever
struggled
for
was
religious
toleration
he
would
as
king
grant
this
toleration
and
satisfy
all
parties
he
either
had
no
deep
religious
convictions
like
coligny
and
dandelot
or
he
preferred
an
undisturbed
crown
to
the
ascendency
of
the
religion
for
which
he
had
so
bravely
fought
what
matter
the
tempter
said
whether
he
reigned
as
a
catholic
or
protestant
monarch
so
long
as
religious
liberty
was
given
to
his
subjects
could
he
have
reigned
forever
could
he
have
been
assured
of
the
toleration
of
his
successors
this
plea
might
have
had
some
force
but
it
was
the
dictate
of
expediency
and
no
man
can
predict
its
ultimate
results
he
was
not
a
religious
man
although
he
was
the
leader
of
the
protestant
party
he
was
far
from
being
even
moral
in
his
social
relations
still
less
had
he
the
austerity
of
manners
and
habits
that
then
characterized
the
huguenots
for
they
were
calvinists
and
presbyterians
he
was
gallant
brave
generous
magnanimous
and
patriotic
the
model
of
a
gentleman
the
impersonation
of
chivalry
the
charm
of
his
friends
the
idol
of
his
army
the
glory
of
his
country
but
there
his
virtues
stopped
he
was
more
of
a
statesman
than
the
leader
of
a
party
he
wanted
to
see
france
united
and
happy
and
prosperous
more
than
he
wanted
to
see
the
ascendency
of
the
huguenots
he
was
now
not
the
king
of
navarre
a
small
country
scarcely
thirty
miles
long
but
the
king
of
france
ruling
as
he
aspired
from
the
pyrenees
to
the
rhine
so
it
is
not
strange
that
he
was
governed
by
the
principles
of
expediency
as
most
monarchs
are
he
wished
to
aggrandize
his
monarchy
that
aim
was
dearer
to
him
than
the
reformed
faith
coligny
would
have
fought
to
the
bitter
end
to
secure
the
triumph
of
the
protestant
cause
but
henry
was
not
so
lofty
a
man
as
the
admiral
he
had
not
his
religious
convictions
or
stern
virtues
or
incorruptible
life
he
was
a
gallant
monarch
an
able
general
a
statesman
yet
fond
of
pleasure
and
of
the
glories
of
a
court
so
henry
made
up
his
mind
to
abjure
his
faith
on
sunday
the
of
july
clad
not
in
helmet
and
cuirass
and
burnished
steel
as
at
ivry
but
in
a
doublet
of
white
satin
and
a
velvet
coat
ornamented
with
jewels
and
orders
and
golden
fleurs
de
lis
and
followed
by
cardinals
and
bishops
and
nobles
he
entered
the
venerable
abbey
of
denis
where
reposed
the
ashes
of
all
his
predecessors
from
dagobert
to
henry
iii
and
was
received
into
the
bosom
of
the
catholic
church
a
solemn
te
deum
was
then
chanted
by
unnumbered
priests
and
the
lofty
pillars
the
marble
altars
the
storied
effigies
the
purple
windows
and
the
vaulted
roof
of
that
mediaeval
monument
to
the
music
of
those
glorious
anthems
which
were
sung
ages
before
the
most
sainted
of
the
kings
of
france
was
buried
in
the
crypt
the
partisans
of
the
catholic
faith
rejoiced
that
a
heretic
had
returned
to
the
fold
of
true
believers
while
the
saddened
disappointed
humiliated
members
of
the
reformed
religion
felt
and
confessed
with
shame
that
their
lauded
protector
had
committed
the
most
lamentable
act
of
apostasy
since
the
emperor
julian
abjured
christianity
it
is
true
they
palliated
his
conduct
and
remained
faithful
to
his
standard
but
they
felt
he
had
committed
a
great
blunder
if
it
were
not
a
great
crime
they
knew
that
their
cause
was
lost
lost
by
him
who
had
been
their
leader
truly
could
they
say
put
not
your
trust
in
princes
to
the
irreligious
but
henry
had
made
a
grand
stroke
of
policy
had
gained
a
kingdom
well
worth
a
mass
had
settled
the
disorders
of
forty
years
had
united
both
catholics
and
protestants
in
fealty
to
his
crown
and
was
left
at
leisure
to
develop
the
resources
of
the
nation
and
lay
a
foundation
for
its
future
greatness
i
can
not
here
enumerate
henry
iv
services
to
france
after
the
long
civil
war
had
closed
they
were
very
great
and
endeared
him
to
the
nation
he
proved
himself
a
wise
and
beneficent
ruler
with
the
aid
of
the
transcendent
abilities
of
sully
whose
counsels
he
respected
he
reduced
taxation
founded
schools
and
libraries
built
hospitals
dug
canals
repaired
fortifications
restrained
military
license
punished
turbulence
and
crime
introduced
useful
manufactures
encouraged
industry
patronized
learning
and
sought
to
perpetuate
peace
he
aimed
to
be
the
father
of
his
people
and
he
was
the
protector
of
the
poor
his
memorable
saying
is
still
dear
to
the
hearts
of
frenchmen
i
hope
so
to
manage
my
kingdom
that
the
poorest
subject
of
it
may
eat
meat
every
day
in
the
week
and
moreover
be
enabled
to
put
a
fowl
into
the
pot
every
sunday
i
should
like
to
point
out
his
great
acts
and
his
enlightened
policy
especially
his
effort
to
create
a
balance
of
power
in
europe
the
settlement
of
the
finances
and
the
establishment
of
various
industries
were
his
most
beneficial
acts
the
taxes
were
reduced
one
half
and
at
his
death
he
had
fifty
millions
in
the
treasury
a
great
sum
in
those
days
having
paid
off
a
debt
of
three
hundred
millions
in
eight
years
these
and
other
public
services
showed
his
humane
nature
and
his
enlightened
mind
until
after
a
glorious
reign
of
years
he
was
cut
off
in
the
prime
of
his
life
and
in
the
midst
of
his
usefulness
by
the
assassin
dagger
may
in
the
year
of
his
age
the
greatest
of
all
the
french
kings
leaving
five
children
by
his
second
wife
marie
de
médicis
four
of
whom
became
kings
or
queens
but
to
consider
particularly
henry
connection
with
the
huguenots
if
he
deserted
their
ranks
he
did
not
forget
them
he
gave
them
religious
toleration
all
they
originally
claimed
in
was
signed
the
memorable
edict
of
nantes
by
which
the
protestants
preserved
their
churches
their
schools
their
consistories
and
their
synods
and
they
retained
as
a
guarantee
several
important
cities
and
fortresses
a
sort
of
in
they
were
made
eligible
to
all
offices
they
were
not
subjected
to
any
grievous
they
enjoyed
social
and
political
equality
as
well
as
unrestricted
religious
liberty
except
in
certain
cities
they
gained
more
than
the
puritans
did
in
the
reign
of
charles
ii
they
were
not
excluded
from
universities
nor
degraded
in
their
social
rank
nor
annoyed
by
unjust
burial
laws
the
two
religions
were
placed
equally
under
the
protection
of
the
government
by
this
edict
the
huguenots
gained
all
that
they
had
struggled
for
still
the
abjuration
of
henry
iv
was
a
great
calamity
to
them
they
lost
their
prestige
they
were
in
a
minority
they
could
count
no
longer
on
the
leadership
of
princes
they
were
deprived
gradually
of
the
countenance
of
powerful
nobles
and
all
the
potent
influences
of
fashion
and
when
a
reaction
against
calvinism
took
place
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
huguenots
had
dwindled
to
a
comparatively
humble
body
of
unimportant
people
they
lost
heart
and
men
of
rank
to
defend
them
when
the
persecution
of
richelieu
overtook
them
in
the
next
reign
they
were
then
unfit
to
contend
successfully
with
that
centralized
monarchy
of
which
henry
iv
had
laid
the
foundation
and
which
richelieu
cemented
by
fraud
and
force
louis
educated
by
the
jesuits
and
always
under
their
influence
repealed
the
charter
which
henry
iv
had
given
them
the
persecution
they
suffered
under
louis
xiv
was
more
dreadful
than
that
they
suffered
under
charles
since
they
had
neither
arms
nor
organization
nor
leaders
nor
fortresses
under
the
persecution
of
the
valois
princes
they
had
condé
and
the
king
of
navarre
and
coligny
for
leaders
they
were
strong
enough
to
fight
for
their
liberties
they
had
enthusiasm
and
prestige
and
hope
under
the
iron
and
centralized
government
of
louis
xiv
they
were
completely
defenceless
like
lambs
before
wolves
they
had
no
hopes
they
could
make
no
defence
they
were
an
obnoxious
slandered
unimportant
unfashionable
people
and
their
light
had
gone
out
they
had
no
religious
enthusiasm
even
they
were
small
farmers
and
tradesmen
and
servants
and
worshipped
god
in
dingy
chapels
no
great
men
arose
among
them
as
among
the
puritans
of
england
they
were
still
evangelical
in
their
creed
but
not
earnest
in
defending
it
so
persecution
wiped
them
out
was
terribly
successful
eight
hundred
thousand
of
them
perished
in
prisons
and
galleys
or
on
scaffolds
and
there
was
no
help
henry
when
he
gave
toleration
to
the
huguenots
never
dreamed
that
his
successors
would
undo
his
work
had
he
foreseen
that
concession
to
the
unchanged
and
unchangeable
enemies
of
human
freedom
would
have
ended
as
it
did
i
believe
his
noble
heart
would
have
revolted
from
any
peace
until
he
could
have
reigned
as
a
protestant
king
oh
had
he
struggled
a
little
longer
for
his
crown
how
different
might
have
been
the
subsequent
history
of
france
and
even
europe
itself
how
much
greater
would
have
been
his
own
fame
even
had
he
died
as
the
defender
of
protestant
liberties
a
greater
glory
than
that
of
gustavus
would
have
been
his
forever
the
immediate
results
of
his
abjuration
were
doubtless
beneficial
to
himself
to
the
huguenots
and
to
his
country
expediency
gives
great
rewards
but
expediency
can
not
control
future
events
it
is
and
only
for
the
time
successful

for
the
ultimate
results
of
the
abjuration
of

the

and
the
systematic
humiliation
of

the
thirty
years
war
of
which
gustavus
adolphus
was
the
greatest
hero
was
the
result
of
those
religious
agitations
which
the
ideas
of
luther
produced
it
was
the
struggle
to
secure
religious
liberty
a
warfare
between
catholic
and
protestant
germany
it
differed
from
the
huguenot
contest
in
this
that
the
protestants
of
france
took
up
arms
against
their
king
to
extort
religious
privileges
whereas
the
protestants
of
germany
were
marshalled
by
independent
princes
against
other
independent
princes
of
a
different
religion
who
sought
to
suppress
protestantism
in
this
warfare
between
catholic
and
protestant
states
there
were
great
political
entanglements
and
issues
that
affected
the
balance
of
power
in
europe
hence
the
thirty
years
war
was
political
as
well
as
religious
it
was
not
purely
a
religious
war
like
the
crusades
although
religious
ideas
gave
rise
to
it
nor
was
it
an
insurrection
of
the
people
against
their
rulers
to
secure
religious
rights
so
much
as
a
contest
between
catholic
and
protestant
princes
to
secure
the
recognition
of
their
religious
opinions
in
their
respective
states
the
emperor
of
germany
in
the
time
of
luther
was
charles
the
most
powerful
potentate
of
europe
and
moreover
a
bigoted
catholic
on
his
abdication
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
events
in
history
the
german
dominions
were
given
to
his
brother
ferdinand
spain
and
the
low
countries
were
bestowed
on
his
son
philip
ferdinand
had
already
been
elected
king
of
the
romans
there
was
a
close
alliance
between
these
princes
of
the
house
of
austria
to
suppress
protestantism
in
europe
the
new
austrian
emperor
was
not
indeed
so
formidable
as
his
father
had
been
but
was
still
one
of
the
greatest
monarchs
of
europe
and
so
powerful
was
the
house
of
austria
that
it
excited
the
jealousy
of
the
other
european
powers
it
was
to
prevent
the
dangerous
ascendency
of
austria
that
henry
iv
of
france
raised
a
great
army
with
a
view
of
invading
germany
but
was
assassinated
before
he
could
carry
his
scheme
into
execution
he
had
armed
france
to
secure
what
is
called
the
balance
of
power
and
it
was
with
the
view
of
securing
this
balance
of
power
that
cardinal
richelieu
though
a
prince
of
the
church
took
the
side
of
the
protestants
in
the
thirty
years
war
this
famous
contest
may
therefore
be
regarded
as
a
civil
war
dividing
the
german
nations
as
a
religious
war
to
establish
freedom
of
belief
and
as
a
war
to
prevent
the
ascendency
of
austria
in
which
a
great
part
of
europe
was
involved
the
beginning
of
the
contest
however
was
the
result
of
religious
agitation
the
ideas
of
luther
created
universal
discussion
discussion
led
to
animosities
all
germany
was
in
a
ferment
and
the
agitation
was
not
confined
to
those
states
which
accepted
the
reformation
but
to
catholic
states
also
the
catholic
princes
resolved
to
crush
the
reformation
first
in
their
own
dominions
and
afterwards
in
the
other
states
of
germany
hence
a
bloody
persecution
of
the
protestants
took
place
in
all
catholic
states
their
sufferings
were
unendurable
for
a
while
they
submitted
to
the
cruel
lash
but
at
last
they
resolved
to
defend
the
right
of
worshipping
god
according
to
their
consciences
they
armed
themselves
for
death
seemed
preferable
to
religious
despotism
for
more
than
fifty
years
after
the
death
of
luther
germany
was
the
scene
of
commotions
ending
in
a
fiery
persecution
at
that
time
germany
was
in
advance
of
the
rest
of
europe
in
wealth
and
intelligence
the
protestants
especially
were
kindled
to
an
enthusiasm
pertaining
to
theological
questions
which
we
in
these
times
can
but
feebly
realize
and
the
germans
were
doubtless
the
most
earnest
and
religious
people
in
europe
in
those
days
there
was
neither
religious
indifference
nor
scepticism
nor
rationalism
the
faith
of
the
people
was
simple
and
they
were
resolved
to
maintain
it
at
any
cost
but
there
were
religious
parties
and
asperities
even
among
the
protestants
the
lutherans
would
not
unite
with
the
calvinists
and
the
calvinists
would
not
accede
to
the
demands
of
the
lutherans
after
a
series
of
struggles
with
the
catholics
the
lutherans
succeeded
by
the
treaty
of
augsburg
in
securing
toleration
and
this
toleration
lasted
during
the
reigns
of
ferdinand
and
maximilian
ii
indeed
germany
enjoyed
tranquillity
until
the
reign
of
matthias
in
this
usurping
emperor
who
had
delivered
germany
from
the
turks
abolished
in
his
dominions
the
protestant
religion
so
far
as
edicts
and
persecution
could
deprive
the
protestants
of
their
religious
liberties
matthias
died
in
and
was
succeeded
by
ferdinand
a
bigoted
prince
who
had
been
educated
by
the
jesuits
this
emperor
was
an
inveterate
enemy
of
the
protestants
he
forbade
their
meetings
deprived
them
even
of
civil
privileges
pulled
down
their
churches
and
schools
erected
scaffolds
in
every
village
appointed
only
catholic
magistrates
and
inflicted
unsparing
cruelties
on
all
who
seceded
from
the
catholic
church
it
was
under
this
austrian
emperor
years
from
the
death
of
luther
that
the
first
act
of
the
bloody
tragedy
which
i
am
to
describe
was
opened
by
an
insurrection
in
bohemia
one
of
the
hereditary
possessions
of
the
house
of
austria
in
this
kingdom
isolated
from
the
rest
of
germany
separated
on
every
side
from
adjoining
states
by
high
mountains
of
volcanic
origin
peopled
with
the
descendants
of
the
ancient
sclavonians
who
were
characterized
by
impulse
and
impetuosity
the
reformed
doctrines
had
taken
a
powerful
hold
of
the
affections
and
convictions
of
the
people
the
followers
of
john
huss
and
jerome
of
prague
were
something
like
the
lollards
of
england
in
their
spirit
and
sincerity
but
they
were
persecuted
by
their
catholic
rulers
with
a
rigor
and
cruelty
never
seen
among
the
lollards
for
ferdinand
ii
was
the
hereditary
king
of
bohemia
as
well
as
emperor
of
germany
at
last
his
tyranny
and
cruelties
became
unendurable
and
in
a
violent
burst
of
passionate
indignation
his
deputies
were
thrown
out
of
the
windows
of
the
chamber
of
the
council
of
regency
at
prague
this
act
of
violence
was
the
signal
of
a
general
revolt
not
in
bohemia
merely
but
in
silesia
moravia
hungary
and
austria
the
celebrated
count
mansfeld
a
soldier
of
fortune
with
only
four
thousand
troops
dared
to
defy
the
whole
imperial
power
and
for
a
while
he
was
successful
the
bohemians
renounced
their
allegiance
to
ferdinand
and
chose
for
their
king
frederick
elector
palatine
of
the
rhine
of
james
of
england
and
head
of
the
protestant
party
in
germany
he
unwisely
abandoned
his
electoral
palace
at
heidelberg
to
grasp
the
royal
sceptre
at
prague
but
he
was
no
match
for
the
austrian
emperor
who
summoning
from
every
quarter
the
allies
and
adherents
of
imperial
power
and
making
peace
with
other
enemies
poured
into
bohemia
such
overwhelming
forces
under
maximilian
duke
of
bavaria
that
his
authority
was
established
more
firmly
than
before
the
battle
of
prague
decided
the
fate
of
bohemia
and
the
elector
palatine
became
a
fugitive
and
his
possessions
were
given
to
the
duke
of
bavaria
then
followed
a
persecution
which
has
had
no
parallel
since
the
slaughter
of
the
albigenses
and
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
the
unhappy
kingdom
of
bohemia
was
abandoned
to
inquisitions
and
executions
all
liberties
were
suppressed
the
nobles
were
decimated
ministers
and
teachers
were
burned
or
beheaded
and
protestants
of
every
rank
age
and
condition
were
prohibited
from
acting
as
guardians
to
children
or
making
wills
or
contracting
marriages
with
catholics
or
holding
any
office
of
trust
and
emolument
they
were
outlawed
as
felons
and
disfranchised
as
infidels
the
halls
of
justice
were
deserted
the
muses
accompanied
the
learned
in
their
melancholy
flight
and
all
that
remained
of
bohemian
gallantry
and
heroism
forsook
the
land
strange
to
say
the
land
of
huss
and
jerome
became
henceforth
the
strongest
hold
of
austrian
despotism
and
papal
superstition
this
is
one
of
those
instances
where
persecution
proved
successful
it
is
a
hackneyed
saying
that
the
blood
of
martyrs
is
the
seed
of
the
church
and
it
is
true
that
lofty
virtues
have
been
generally
developed
by
and
martyrdom
and
that
only
through
great
tribulation
have
permanent
blessings
been
secured
the
hollanders
by
inundating
their
fields
and
fighting
literally
to
the
last
ditch
preserved
their
liberties
and
secured
ultimate
prosperity
the
fires
of
smithfield
did
not
destroy
the
reformed
religion
in
england
in
the
time
of
mary
and
the
jails
and
judicial
murders
of
later
and
better
times
did
not
prevent
the
progress
of
popular
rights
or
the
extension
of
puritanism
in
the
wilds
of
the
american
continent
but
in
the
history
of
society
the
instances
are
unfortunately
numerous
when
bigotry
and
despotism
have
kindled
their
infernal
fires
and
erected
their
bloody
scaffolds
not
to
purify
the
church
and
nourish
the
principles
of
christian
progress
but
to
destroy
what
is
good
as
well
as
what
is
evil
what
availed
the
struggles
of
the
waldenses
in
the
middle
ages
who
came
to
the
rescue
of
savonarola
when
he
attempted
to
reform
the
lives
of
degenerate
florentines
what
beneficial
effects
resulted
ultimately
from
the
inquisition
in
spain
how
was
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
overruled
for
the
good
of
the
huguenots
of
france
and
yet
the
unfortunate
suppression
of
religious
liberty
in
bohemia
and
the
sufferings
of
those
who
came
to
her
rescue
especially
the
misfortunes
of
the
elector
palatine
arrayed
the
protestant
princes
of
germany
against
the
emperor
and
created
general
indignation
throughout
europe
austria
became
more
than
ever
a
hated
and
dreaded
power
not
merely
to
the
states
of
sweden
denmark
holland
and
england
but
to
catholic
france
herself
then
ruled
by
that
able
and
ambitious
statesman
cardinal
richelieu
before
whose
tomb
in
an
after
age
the
czar
peter
bowed
in
earnest
homage
from
the
recollection
and
admiration
of
his
transcendent
labors
in
behalf
of
absolutism
even
richelieu
a
prince
of
the
church
and
the
persecutor
of
the
huguenots
was
alarmed
at
the
encroachments
of
austria
and
intrigued
with
protestant
princes
to
undermine
her
dangerous
ascendency
then
opened
the
second
act
of
the
bloody
drama
of
the
seventeenth
century
when
the
allied
protestant
princes
of
germany
assisted
by
the
english
and
the
dutch
rallied
under
the
leadership
of
christian
king
of
denmark
and
resolved
to
recover
what
they
had
lost
while
bethlen
gabor
a
transylvanian
prince
at
the
head
of
an
army
of
robbers
invaded
hungary
and
austria
the
emperor
straitened
in
his
finances
was
in
no
condition
to
meet
this
powerful
confederacy
although
the
illustrious
tilly
was
the
commander
of
his
forces
but
the
demon
of
despotism
who
never
sleeps
raised
up
to
his
assistance
a
great
military
genius
this
was
wallenstein
duke
of
friedland
the
richest
noble
in
bohemia
the
person
whom
he
most
resembled
in
that
age
of
struggle
and
contending
forces
when
despotism
sought
unscrupulous
agents
was
thomas
wentworth
earl
of
strafford
the
right
hand
of
charles
in
his
warfare
against
the
liberties
of
england
like
stratford
he
was
an
apostate
from
the
principles
in
which
he
had
been
educated
like
him
he
had
arisen
from
a
comparatively
humble
station
like
him
his
talents
were
as
commanding
as
his
ambition
devoted
first
to
his
own
exaltation
and
secondly
to
the
cause
of
absolutism
with
which
he
sympathized
with
all
the
intensity
that
a
proud
and
domineering
spirit
may
be
supposed
to
feel
for
the
struggles
of
inexperienced
democracy
like
the
english
statesman
the
german
general
was
a
jesuit
in
the
use
of
tools
jealous
of
his
authority
liberal
in
his
rewards
and
fearful
in
his
vengeance
though
greedy
of
admiration
and
fond
of
display
he
surrounded
himself
with
mystery
and
gloom
like
strafford
he
was
commanding
in
his
person
dignified
reserved
and
sullen
with
an
eye
piercing
and
melancholy
a
brow
lowering
with
thought
and
care
and
a
lip
compressed
into
determination
and
twisted
into
a
smile
of
ironical
disdain
this
nobleman
had
fought
with
distinction
as
a
colonel
at
the
battle
of
prague
when
bohemian
liberties
had
been
prostrated
and
had
signally
distinguished
himself
in
his
infamous
crusade
against
his
own
countrymen
he
offered
at
his
own
expense
to
raise
and
equip
an
army
of
fifty
thousand
men
in
the
service
of
the
emperor
but
demanded
as
a
condition
that
he
should
have
the
appointment
of
all
his
officers
and
the
privilege
of
enriching
himself
and
army
from
the
spoils
and
confiscations
of
conquered
territories
these
terms
were
extraordinary
and
humiliating
to
an
absolute
sovereign
yet
at
the
crisis
in
which
ferdinand
was
placed
they
were
too
tempting
to
be
refused
wallenstein
fulfilled
his
promises
and
raised
in
an
incredibly
short
time
an
immense
army
composed
of
outlaws
and
robbers
and
adventurers
from
all
nations
he
advanced
rapidly
against
the
allied
protestant
forces
levying
enormous
contributions
wherever
he
appeared
as
imperious
to
friends
as
to
foes
mistrusted
and
feared
by
both
yet
supremely
indifferent
to
praise
or
censure
resting
on
the
power
of
brute
force
and
his
ability
to
enrich
his
soldiers
possessing
a
fine
military
genius
unbounded
means
and
unscrupulous
rapacity
and
assisted
by
such
generals
as
tilly
pappenheim
and
piccolomini
seconded
by
maximilian
duke
of
bavaria
he
soon
reduced
his
enemies
to
despair
the
king
of
denmark
was
unequal
to
the
contest
and
sued
for
peace
the
elector
frederic
again
became
a
fugitive
the
duke
of
brunswick
was
killed
and
the
intrepid
mansfeld
died
the
electors
of
saxony
and
brandenburg
the
natural
defenders
of
protestantism
and
the
leading
princes
of
the
league
were
awed
into
an
abject
neutrality
the
old
protectors
of
lutheranism
were
timid
and
despairing
the
monarchs
of
europe
trembled
germany
lay
prostrate
and
bleeding
christendom
stood
aghast
at
the
greatness
of
the
calamities
which
afflicted
germany
and
threatened
neighboring
nations
but
the
emperor
at
vienna
was
overjoyed
and
swelled
with
arrogance
and
triumph
he
divided
among
the
members
of
his
imperial
house
the
rich
benefices
of
the
church
and
bestowed
upon
his
victorious
general
the
revenues
of
provinces
he
now
resolved
to
pursue
the
king
of
denmark
into
his
remotest
territories
to
dethrone
the
king
of
sweden
to
give
away
the
crown
of
poland
to
aid
the
spaniards
in
the
recovery
of
the
united
provinces
to
exterminate
the
protestant
religion
to
subvert
the
liberties
of
the
german
nations
and
reign
as
a
terrible
incarnation
of
imperial
tyranny
he
would
even
revive
the
dreams
of
charlemagne
and
charles
and
make
vienna
the
centre
of
that
power
which
once
emanated
from
borne
he
would
ally
himself
more
strongly
with
the
pope
and
extend
the
double
tyranny
of
priests
and
kings
over
the
whole
continent
of
europe
fines
imprisonments
tortures
banishments
and
executions
were
now
added
to
the
desolations
which
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
soldiers
inflicted
on
villages
and
cities
that
had
been
for
generations
increasing
in
wealth
and
prosperity
in
that
dark
hour
of
calamity
and
fears
providence
raised
up
a
greater
hero
than
wallenstein
a
noble
protector
and
intrepid
deliverer
even
gustavus
adolphus
king
of
sweden
and
the
third
act
of
the
political
tragedy
opens
with
his
brilliant
career
carlyle
has
somewhere
said
is
not
every
genius
an
impossibility
until
he
appear
this
is
singularly
true
of
gustavus
adolphus
it
was
the
last
thing
for
contemporaries
to
conjecture
that
the
deliverer
of
germany
and
the
great
hero
of
the
thirty
years
war
would
have
arisen
in
the
regions
of
northern
europe
no
great
character
had
arisen
in
sweden
of
exalted
fame
neither
king
nor
poet
nor
philosopher
nor
even
singer
the
little
kingdom
to
all
appearance
was
rich
only
in
mines
of
iron
and
hills
of
snow
it
was
not
till
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
that
sweden
was
even
delivered
from
base
dependence
on
denmark
but
gustavus
before
he
was
years
of
age
had
made
his
countrymen
a
nation
of
soldiers
had
freed
his
kingdom
from
danish
russian
and
polish
enemies
had
made
great
improvements
in
the
art
of
war
having
introduced
a
new
system
of
tactics
never
materially
improved
except
by
frederic
ii
had
reduced
strategy
to
a
science
had
raised
the
importance
of
the
infantry
had
increased
the
strictness
of
military
discipline
had
trained
up
a
band
of
able
generals
and
inspired
his
soldiers
with
unbounded
enthusiasm
and
he
had
raised
in
the
camp
a
new
tone
of
moral
feeling
not
even
cromwell
equalled
him
in
divesting
war
of
its
customary
atrocities
and
keeping
alive
the
spirit
of
religion
the
worship
of
god
formed
one
of
the
most
important
duties
of
the
swedish
army
wherever
located
twice
every
day
the
roll
of
the
drum
assembled
the
soldiers
to
prayer
the
usual
vices
of
soldiers
like
profanity
and
drunkenness
and
gambling
were
uniformly
punished
death
was
inflicted
on
any
soldier
who
assaulted
a
citizen
in
his
house
even
a
certificate
was
required
of
the
chief
citizens
of
any
place
where
troops
were
quartered
that
their
conduct
had
been
orderly
he
never
allowed
under
any
provocation
a
city
to
be
taken
by
assault
a
striking
contrast
to
the
imperial
generals
nor
amid
the
toils
and
dangers
of
war
was
gustavus
unmindful
of
his
duties
as
a
king
he
was
one
of
the
most
enlightened
statesmen
that
had
appeared
since
charlemagne
and
alfred
he
established
schools
and
colleges
founded
libraries
reformed
the
codes
of
law
introduced
wise
mercantile
regulations
rewarded
eminent
merit
respected
the
voice
of
experience
and
developed
the
industries
of
the
country
what
richelieu
and
colbert
did
for
france
what
burleigh
and
cromwell
did
for
england
gustavus
did
for
sweden
his
prime
minister
is
illustrious
for
wisdom
and
ability
the
celebrated
oxenstiern
through
whose
labors
and
genius
the
country
felt
no
impoverishment
from
war
he
laid
the
foundation
of
that
prosperity
which
made
a
little
kingdom
great
but
all
his
excellences
as
a
general
a
statesman
and
a
ruler
paled
before
the
exalted
virtues
of
his
private
life
his
urbanity
his
gentleness
his
modesty
his
meekness
his
simplicity
and
his
love
won
all
hearts
and
have
never
been
exceeded
except
by
alfred
the
great
he
was
a
saint
louis
on
a
throne
in
marked
contrast
with
the
suspicion
duplicity
roughness
and
egotism
of
oliver
cromwell
the
only
other
great
man
of
the
century
who
equalled
gustavus
in
the
value
of
public
services
and
enlightened
mind
it
is
not
often
that
christian
graces
and
virtues
are
developed
amid
the
tumults
of
war
david
lost
nothing
of
his
pious
fervor
and
reliance
on
god
when
pursuing
the
philistines
nor
marcus
aurelius
when
fighting
barbarians
on
the
frozen
danube
the
perils
and
vicissitudes
of
war
with
the
momentous
interests
involved
made
lincoln
shine
amid
all
his
jokes
a
firm
believer
in
the
overruling
power
that
napoleon
failed
to
see
and
so
of
washington
he
was
a
better
man
and
firmer
christian
from
the
responsibilities
that
were
thrust
upon
him
not
so
with
frederic
the
great
and
the
marshals
of
louis
with
the
exception
of
turenne
war
seemed
rather
to
develop
their
worst
qualities
it
usually
makes
a
man
unscrupulous
hard
and
arrogant
military
life
is
anything
but
interesting
in
the
usual
bearing
of
prussian
officers
in
our
own
revolutionary
war
generals
developed
pride
and
avarice
and
jealousy
war
turned
tilly
into
a
fiend
how
cold
and
sullen
and
selfish
it
made
napoleon
how
grasping
and
greedy
it
made
marlborough
how
unscrupulous
it
made
clive
and
hastings
how
stubborn
and
proud
it
made
wellington
how
vain
and
pompous
it
made
scott
how
overbearing
it
made
and
villars
how
reckless
and
hard
it
made
ney
and
murat
the
dangers
and
miseries
of
war
develop
sternness
hardness
and
indifference
to
suffering
it
is
violence
and
violence
does
not
naturally
produce
the
peaceful
virtues
it
produces
courage
indeed
but
physical
rather
than
moral
least
of
all
that
spiritual
courage
which
makes
martyrs
and
saints
it
makes
boon
companions
not
friends
it
gives
exaggerated
ideas
of
it
exalts
the
outward
and
material
not
the
spiritual
and
the
real
the
very
tread
of
a
military
veteran
is
stately
proud
and
conscious
like
that
of
a
procession
of
cardinals
or
of
railway
kings
so
that
when
a
man
inured
to
camps
and
battles
shines
in
the
modest
unconsciousness
of
a
christian
gentleman
or
meditative
sage
we
feel
unusual
reverence
for
him
we
feel
that
his
soul
is
unpolluted
and
that
he
is
superior
to
ordinary
temptations
and
nothing
in
war
develops
the
greatness
of
the
higher
qualities
of
heart
and
soul
but
the
sacredness
of
a
great
cause
this
takes
a
man
out
of
himself
and
binds
his
soul
to
god
he
learns
to
feel
that
he
is
merely
an
instrument
of
almighty
power
it
was
the
sacredness
of
a
great
cause
that
shed
such
a
lustre
on
the
character
of
washington
how
unimpressible
the
victories
of
charlemagne
disconnected
with
that
work
of
civilization
which
he
was
sent
into
the
world
to
reconstruct
how
devoid
of
interest
and
grandeur
were
the
battles
of
marston
moor
and
worcester
without
reference
to
those
principles
of
religious
liberty
which
warmed
the
soul
of
cromwell
the
conflicts
of
bunker
hill
and
princeton
were
insignificant
when
compared
with
the
mighty
array
of
forces
at
blenheim
or
austerlitz
but
when
associated
with
ideas
of
american
independence
and
the
extension
of
american
greatness
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
their
sublime
results
are
impressed
upon
the
mind
with
power
even
french
soldiers
have
seldom
been
victorious
unless
inspired
by
ideas
of
liberty
or
patriotism
it
is
ever
the
majesty
of
a
cause
which
makes
not
only
great
generals
but
good
men
and
it
was
the
greatness
of
the
cause
with
which
gustavus
adolphus
was
identified
that
gave
to
his
character
such
moral
beauty
that
same
beauty
which
exalted
william
the
silent
and
william
of
orange
amid
the
disasters
of
their
country
and
made
them
eternally
popular
after
all
the
permanent
idols
of
popular
idolatry
are
not
the
intellectually
great
but
the
morally
beautiful
and
all
the
more
attractive
when
their
moral
excellence
is
in
strong
contrast
with
the
prevailing
vices
of
contemporaries
it
was
the
moral
greatness
of
gustavus
which
has
given
to
him
his
truest
fame
great
was
he
as
a
military
genius
but
greater
still
as
a
benefactor
of
oppressed
peoples
surely
it
was
no
common
hero
who
armed
himself
for
the
deliverance
of
germany
which
prostrate
and
bleeding
held
out
her
arms
to
be
rescued
from
political
degradation
and
for
the
preservation
of
liberties
dearer
to
good
men
than
life
itself
all
protestant
europe
responded
to
the
cry
for
great
interests
were
now
at
stake
not
in
germany
merely
but
in
the
neighboring
nations
it
was
to
deliver
his
lutheran
brethren
in
danger
of
extermination
and
to
raise
a
barrier
against
the
overwhelming
power
of
austria
that
gustavus
adolphus
lent
his
armies
to
the
protestant
princes
of
germany
other
motives
may
have
entered
into
his
mind
his
pride
had
been
piqued
by
the
refusal
of
the
emperor
ferdinand
to
acknowledge
his
title
as
king
his
dignity
was
wounded
by
the
contemptuous
insolence
shown
to
this
ambassadors
his
fears
were
excited
that
austria
might
seek
to
deprive
him
of
his
throne
the
imperial
armies
had
already
conquered
holstein
and
jutland
provinces
that
belonged
to
sweden
unless
austria
were
humbled
sweden
would
be
ruined
gustavus
embarked
in
the
war
against
austria
as
william
iii
afterwards
did
against
louis
xiv
wars
to
preserve
the
balance
of
power
have
not
generally
been
deemed
offensive
when
any
power
has
become
inordinately
aggrandized
pitt
opposed
napoleon
to
rescue
europe
from
universal
monarchy
so
gustavus
deeply
persuaded
of
the
duties
laid
upon
him
assembled
together
the
deputies
of
his
kingdom
the
representatives
of
the
three
estates
and
explained
to
them
his
intentions
and
motives
i
know
said
he
the
dangers
i
am
about
to
encounter
i
know
that
it
is
probable
i
shall
never
return
i
feel
convinced
that
my
life
will
terminate
on
the
field
of
battle
let
no
one
imagine
that
i
am
actuated
by
private
feelings
or
fondness
for
war
my
object
is
to
set
bounds
to
the
increasing
power
of
a
dangerous
empire
before
all
resistance
becomes
impossible
your
children
will
not
bless
your
memory
if
instead
of
civil
and
religious
freedom
you
bequeath
to
them
the
superstitions
of
monks
and
the
double
tyranny
of
popes
and
emperors
we
must
prevent
the
subjugation
of
the
continent
before
we
are
reduced
to
depend
upon
a
narrow
sea
as
the
only
safeguard
of
our
liberties
for
it
is
delusion
to
suppose
that
a
mighty
empire
will
not
be
able
to
raise
fleets
if
once
firmly
established
on
the
shores
of
the
ocean
then
taking
his
infant
daughter
christiana
in
his
arms
he
recommended
her
to
the
protection
of
the
nation
and
bade
adieu
to
the
several
orders
of
the
state
amid
their
tears
and
sobs
he
invoked
upon
them
and
his
enterprise
the
blessing
of
almighty
god
then
hastening
his
preparations
he
embarked
his
forces
for
the
deliverance
of
germany
it
was
on
the
of
june
just
one
hundred
years
after
the
confession
of
augsburg
that
gustavus
adolphus
landed
on
the
german
soil
if
ever
the
ruler
of
a
nation
is
to
be
justified
for
going
to
war
when
his
country
is
not
actually
invaded
it
was
doubtless
gustavus
adolphus
had
he
withheld
his
aid
the
probability
is
that
all
germany
would
have
succumbed
to
the
austrian
emperor
and
have
been
incorporated
with
his
empire
and
not
only
germany
but
denmark
and
sweden
the
protestant
religion
would
have
been
suppressed
in
northern
germany
as
it
was
in
france
by
louis
xiv
there
would
have
been
no
protestant
country
in
europe
but
england
and
perhaps
holland
a
united
german
empire
with
the
restoration
of
the
catholic
religion
would
have
been
a
most
dangerous
power
much
more
so
than
at
the
present
day
some
there
are
doubtless
who
would
condemn
gustavus
for
the
invasion
of
germany
and
think
he
ought
to
have
stayed
at
home
and
let
his
unfortunate
neighbors
take
care
of
themselves
the
best
way
they
could
perhaps
the
peace
societies
would
take
this
ground
and
the
apostles
of
thrift
and
material
prosperity
but
i
confess
when
i
see
a
man
like
the
king
of
sweden
with
all
the
temptations
of
luxury
and
ease
encountering
all
sorts
of
perils
and
fatigues
yea
offering
up
his
life
in
battle
in
order
to
emancipate
suffering
humanity
then
every
generous
impulse
and
every
dictate
of
enlightened
reason
urge
me
to
add
my
praises
with
those
of
past
generations
in
honor
of
such
exalted
heroism
according
to
the
authors
of
those
times
signs
and
prodigies
appeared
to
warn
mankind
of
the
sanguinary
struggle
which
was
now
to
take
place
in
the
dead
of
night
on
wild
heaths
in
solitary
valleys
the
clang
of
arms
was
heard
armies
were
seen
encountering
each
other
in
the
heavens
marshalled
by
aërial
leaders
while
monstrous
births
mock
suns
and
showers
of
fire
filled
the
minds
of
the
superstitious
with
fear
and
dread
it
would
be
puerile
to
believe
these
statements
yet
if
the
stupendous
framework
of
external
nature
ever
could
exhibit
sympathy
with
the
brief
calamities
of
man
it
may
well
be
supposed
to
have
been
displayed
when
one
of
the
fairest
portions
of
the
earth
was
again
to
be
ravaged
with
fire
and
sword
and
when
the
melancholy
lesson
so
often
exemplified
before
was
to
receive
still
further
confirmation
that
of
all
the
evils
with
which
divine
wisdom
permits
this
world
to
be
visited
none
can
be
compared
to
those
which
the
wrath
of
man
is
so
often
eager
to
inflict
upon
his
fellows
i
need
not
detail
the
various
campaigns
of
the
swedish
hero
his
marchings
and
his
sieges
and
battles
and
victories
until
the
power
of
austria
was
humbled
and
northern
germany
was
delivered
the
history
of
all
war
is
the
same
there
is
no
variety
except
to
the
eye
of
a
military
man
military
history
is
a
dreary
record
of
dangers
sufferings
mistakes
and
crimes
occasionally
it
is
relieved
by
brilliant
feats
of
courage
and
genius
which
create
enthusiastic
admiration
but
generally
it
is
monotonous
it
has
but
little
interest
except
to
contemporaries
who
now
reads
the
details
of
our
last
great
war
who
has
not
almost
forgotten
the
names
of
its
ordinary
generals
how
sickening
the
description
of
the
crusades
the
mind
can
not
dwell
on
the
conflagrations
the
massacres
the
starvations
the
desolations
of
an
invaded
country
few
even
read
a
description
of
the
famous
battles
of
the
world
which
decided
the
fate
of
nations
when
battles
and
marches
are
actually
taking
place
and
all
is
uncertainty
then
there
is
a
vivid
curiosity
to
learn
immediate
results
but
when
wars
are
ended
we
forget
the
intense
excitements
which
we
may
have
felt
when
they
were
taking
place
we
gaze
with
eager
interest
on
a
game
of
football
but
when
it
is
ended
we
care
but
little
for
the
victors
it
is
only
when
the
remote
consequences
of
great
wars
are
traced
by
philosophical
historians
revealing
the
ways
of
providence
retribution
and
eternal
justice
that
interest
is
enkindled
no
book
to
me
is
more
dreary
and
uninteresting
than
the
campaigns
of
frederic
though
painted
by
the
hand
of
one
of
the
greatest
masters
of
modern
times
even
interest
in
the
details
of
the
battles
of
napoleon
is
absorbed
in
the
interest
we
feel
in
the
man
how
he
was
driven
hither
and
thither
by
the
providence
he
ignored
and
made
to
point
a
moral
to
an
immortal
tale
all
we
care
about
the
histories
of
wars
is
the
general
results
and
the
principles
to
be
deduced
as
they
bear
on
the
cause
of
civilization
it
was
fortunate
for
the
fame
and
the
cause
of
gustavus
that
at
the
very
outset
of
his
career
when
he
landed
in
pomerania
with
his
small
army
of
twenty
thousand
men
the
emperor
had
been
prevailed
upon
by
a
pressure
he
could
not
resist
and
the
intrigues
of
all
the
german
princes
to
dispense
with
the
services
of
wallenstein
spain
france
bavaria
the
whole
electoral
college
catholic
as
well
as
protestant
clamored
for
the
discharge
of
the
most
unscrupulous
general
of
modern
times
he
was
detested
and
feared
by
everybody
humanity
shed
tears
over
his
exactions
and
cruelties
while
general
fears
were
aroused
that
his
influence
was
dangerous
to
the
public
peace
most
people
supposed
that
the
war
was
virtually
ended
and
that
he
was
therefore
no
longer
needed
loath
was
ferdinand
to
part
with
the
man
to
whom
he
was
indebted
for
the
establishment
of
his
throne
and
it
seems
he
was
also
personally
attached
to
him
long
did
he
resist
expostulations
and
threats
he
felt
as
poor
ganganelli
felt
when
called
upon
by
the
bourbon
courts
of
europe
to
annul
the
charter
of
the
jesuits
wallenstein
would
probably
have
been
retained
by
ferdinand
had
this
been
possible
but
the
emperor
was
forced
to
yield
to
overwhelming
importunities
so
the
dismissal
of
the
general
was
decreed
at
the
diet
of
worms
and
a
messenger
of
the
emperor
delivered
to
the
haughty
victor
the
decree
of
his
sovereign
wallenstein
was
then
at
the
head
of
one
hundred
thousand
men
would
he
obey
the
order
would
he
retire
to
private
life
ambitious
and
unscrupulous
as
he
was
he
knew
that
no
one
however
powerful
could
resist
an
authority
universally
conceded
to
be
supreme
and
legitimate
it
was
like
the
recall
of
a
proconsul
by
the
roman
emperor
and
senate
he
could
resist
for
a
time
but
resistance
meant
ultimate
ruin
he
also
knew
that
he
would
be
recalled
for
he
was
necessary
to
the
emperor
he
anticipated
the
successes
of
gustavus
he
was
not
prepared
to
be
a
traitor
he
would
wait
his
time
so
he
resigned
his
command
without
a
moment
hesitation
and
with
apparent
cheerfulness
he
even
loaded
the
messenger
with
costly
gifts
he
appeared
happy
to
be
relieved
from
labor
and
responsibility
and
retired
at
once
to
his
vast
bohemian
estates
to
pursue
his
favorite
studies
in
the
science
of
the
stars
to
enshroud
himself
in
mystery
and
gloom
and
dazzle
his
countrymen
by
the
splendor
of
his
life
his
table
was
never
furnished
with
less
than
one
hundred
covers
none
but
a
noble
of
ancient
family
was
intrusted
with
the
office
of
superintending
his
household
an
armed
guard
of
fifty
men
waited
in
his
antechamber
the
ramparts
of
his
castle
were
lined
with
sentinels
six
barons
and
as
many
knights
constantly
attended
on
his
person
sixty
pages
were
trained
and
supported
in
his
palace
which
was
decorated
with
all
the
wonders
of
art
and
almost
realized
the
fictions
of
eastern
luxury
in
this
splendid
retirement
wallenstein
brooded
on
his
wrongs
and
waited
for
the
future
the
dismissal
of
this
able
general
was
a
great
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
emperor
there
were
left
no
generals
capable
of
opposing
gustavus
the
supreme
command
had
devolved
on
tilly
able
but
bigoted
and
best
known
for
his
remorseless
cruelty
when
magdeburg
was
taken
by
assault
the
direst
tragedy
of
the
war
this
city
was
one
of
the
first
to
welcome
the
invasion
of
the
king
of
sweden
and
also
to
adopt
the
protestant
religion
it
was
the
most
prosperous
city
in
northern
germany
one
of
the
richest
and
most
populous
against
this
mercantile
fortress
tilly
directed
all
his
energies
for
he
detested
the
spirit
of
its
people
it
was
closely
invested
by
the
imperial
troops
and
fell
before
gustavus
could
advance
to
relieve
it
it
was
neglected
by
the
electors
of
saxony
and
brandenburg
who
were
timid
and
pusillanimous
and
it
was
lulled
into
false
security
by
its
strong
position
and
defences
not
sufficient
preparation
for
defence
had
been
made
by
the
citizens
who
trusted
to
its
strong
walls
and
knew
that
gustavus
was
advancing
to
relieve
it
but
unexpectedly
it
was
assaulted
in
the
most
daring
and
desperate
manner
and
all
was
lost
on
a
sabbath
morning
the
sudden
toll
of
alarm
bells
the
roar
of
artillery
the
roll
of
drums
beating
to
quarter
and
the
piercing
cries
of
women
and
children
mingled
with
the
shouts
and
execrations
of
brutal
and
victorious
soldiers
announced
the
fate
of
magdeburg
forty
thousand
people
men
women
and
children
were
inhumanly
butchered
without
necessity
quarter
compassion
or
remorse
so
cold
and
hard
is
war
this
was
the
saddest
massacre
in
the
history
of
germany
and
one
of
the
greatest
crimes
that
a
successful
general
ever
committed
history
has
no
language
and
painting
no
colors
to
depict
the
horrors
of
that
dreadful
scene
and
the
interval
of
more
than
two
hundred
years
has
not
weakened
the
impression
of
its
horrors
the
sack
of
magdeburg
stands
out
in
the
annals
of
war
like
the
siege
of
tyre
and
the
fall
of
jerusalem
but
it
roused
the
protestants
as
from
a
trance
it
united
them
as
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
united
the
huguenots
they
marched
under
the
standard
of
gustavus
with
the
same
enthusiasm
that
the
huguenots
showed
under
henry
iv
at
the
battle
of
ivry
there
was
now
no
limit
to
the
successes
of
the
heroic
swede
the
decisive
battle
of
leipsic
the
passage
of
the
lech
the
defence
of
nuremberg
and
the
great
final
victory
at
lutzen
raised
the
military
fame
of
gustavus
to
a
height
unknown
since
hannibal
led
his
armies
over
the
alps
or
caesar
encountered
the
patrician
hosts
at
the
battle
of
pharsalia
no
victories
were
ever
more
brilliant
than
his
and
they
not
only
gave
him
a
deathless
fame
but
broke
forever
the
austrian
fetters
his
reputation
as
a
general
was
fairly
earned
he
ranks
with
condé
henry
frederic
the
great
marlborough
and
wellington
not
perhaps
with
alexander
caesar
and
napoleon
those
phenomena
of
military
genius
the
exalted
trio
who
shine
amid
the
glories
of
the
battlefield
as
homer
dante
and
shakspeare
loom
up
in
fame
above
other
immortal
poets
in
two
years
from
the
landing
of
gustavus
adolphus
on
the
island
of
ruden
near
the
southern
extremity
of
the
baltic
he
expelled
a
triumphant

traversed
the

the

ascended
the

entered

restored
the

took
possession
of
some
of
the
strongest
fortresses
on
the
rhine
overran
bavaria
occupied
its
capital
crossed
the
danube
and
then
returned
to
saxony
to
offer
up
his
life
on
the
plains
of
lutzen
there
on
that
memorable
battlefield
where
the
descending
sun
of
victory
in
later
times
shed
a
delusive
gleam
on
the
eagles
of
napoleon
before
his
irremediable
ruin
did
gustavus
encounter
the
great
antagonist
of
german
liberties
whom
the
necessities
of
the
emperor
had
summoned
from
retirement
wallenstein
once
more
commanded
the
imperial
armies
but
only
on
conditions
which
made
him
virtually
independent
of
his
master
he
was
generalissimo
with
almost
unlimited
authority
so
long
as
the
war
should
last
and
the
emperor
agreed
to
remove
neither
the
general
himself
nor
his
officers
and
gave
him
principalities
and
spoils
indefinitely
he
was
the
most
powerful
subject
in
europe
and
the
greatest
general
next
to
gustavus
i
read
of
no
french
or
english
general
who
has
been
armed
with
such
authority
cromwell
and
napoleon
took
it
it
was
not
conferred
by
legitimate
and
supreme
power
had
wallenstein
been
successful
to
the
end
he
might
have
grasped
the
imperial
sceptre
had
gustavus
lived
he
might
have
been
the
dictator
of
germany
impatient
were
both
commanders
to
engage
in
the
contest
which
each
knew
would
be
decisive
long
did
they
wait
for
opportunities
at
last
on
the
of
november
the
defenders
and
the
foes
of
german
liberties
arrayed
themselves
for
the
great
final
encounter
the
protestants
gained
the
day
but
gustavus
fell
exclaiming
to
the
murderous
soldiers
who
demanded
his
name
and
quality
i
am
the
king
of
sweden
and
i
seal
this
day
with
my
blood
the
liberties
and
religion
of
the
german
nation
the
death
of
gustavus
adolphus
in
the
hour
of
victory
was
a
shock
which
came
upon
the
allies
like
the
loss
of
the
dearest
friend
the
victory
seemed
too
dearly
purchased
the
greatest
protector
which
protestantism
ever
knew
had
perished
as
he
himself
predicted
pappenheim
the
bravest
of
the
austrian
generals
also
perished
and
with
him
the
flower
of
wallenstein
army
schiller
thinks
that
gustavus
died
fortunately
for
his
fame
that
had
he
survived
the
decisive
battle
of
lutzen
he
not
only
could
have
dictated
terms
to
the
emperor
but
might
have
yielded
to
the
almost
irresistible
temptation
of
giving
laws
to
the
countries
he
had
emancipated
but
he
did
not
live
to
be
tried
that
rarest
of
all
trials
was
reserved
alone
for
our
washington
to
pass
through
triumphantly
to
set
an
example
to
all
countries
and
ages
of
the
superiority
of
moral
to
intellectual
excellence
gustavus
might
have
triumphed
like
washington
and
he
might
have
yielded
like
cromwell
we
do
not
know
this
only
we
know
that
he
was
not
merely
the
great
hero
of
the
thirty
years
war
but
one
of
the
best
men
who
ever
wore
a
crown
that
he
conferred
on
the
protestants
and
on
civilization
an
immortal
and
inestimable
service
and
that
he
is
to
be
regarded
as
one
of
the
great
benefactors
of
the
world
the
thirty
years
war
loses
its
dramatic
interest
after
the
battle
of
lutzen
the
final
issue
was
settled
although
the
war
was
carried
on
sixteen
years
longer
it
was
not
till
that
the
peace
of
westphalia
was
signed
which
guaranteed
the
liberties
of
germany
and
established
the
balance
of
power
that
famous
treaty
has
also
been
made
the
foundation
of
all
subsequent
treaties
between
the
european
nations
and
created
an
era
in
modern
history
it
took
place
after
the
death
of
richelieu
when
mazarin
ruled
france
in
the
name
of
louis
and
when
charles
was
in
the
hands
of
cromwell
with
the
death
of
gustavus
we
also
partially
lose
sight
of
wallenstein
he
never
afterwards
gained
victories
commensurate
with
his
reputation
he
remained
after
the
battle
of
lutzen
unaccountably
inactive
in
bohemia
but
if
his
military
fame
was
tarnished
his
pride
and
power
remained
his
military
exactions
became
unendurable
and
it
is
probable
he
was
a
traitor
so
unpopular
did
he
become
and
so
suspicious
was
the
emperor
who
lost
confidence
in
him
that
he
was
assassinated
by
the
order
of
his
sovereign
he
was
too
formidable
to
be
removed
in
any
other
way
he
probably
deserved
his
fate
although
it
was
difficult
to
bring
this
great
culprit
to
justice
yet
his
death
is
a
lesson
to
traitors
there
are
many
ways
said
cicero
in
which
a
man
may
die
referring
to
the
august
usurper
of
the
roman
world
i
will
not
dwell
on
the
sixteen
remaining
years
of
the
thirty
war
it
is
too
horrible
a
picture
to
paint
the
desolation
and
misery
which
overwhelmed
germany
were
most
frightful
and
revolting
the
war
was
carried
on
without
system
or
genius
expeditions
were
undertaken
apparently
with
no
other
view
than
to
desolate
hostile
provinces
till
in
the
end
provisions
and
winter
quarters
formed
the
principal
object
of
the
summer
campaigns
disease
famine
and
want
of
discipline
swept
away
whole
armies
before
they
had
seen
an
enemy
soldiers
deserted
the
ranks
and
became
roving
banditti
law
and
justice
entirely
vanished
from
the
land
germany
it
is
asserted
by
mitchell
lost
probably
twelve
millions
of
people
before
the
war
the
population
was
sixteen
millions
at
the
close
of
the
war
it
had
dwindled
to
four
millions
the
city
of
augsburg
at
one
time
had
eighty
thousand
inhabitants
at
the
close
of
the
war
it
had
only
eighteen
thousand
no
less
than
thirty
thousand
villages
and
hamlets
were
destroyed
peaceful
peasants
were
hunted
for
mere
sport
like
the
beasts
of
the
forest
citizens
were
nailed
up
and
fired
at
like
targets
women
were
collected
into
bands
driven
like
slaves
into
camp
and
exposed
to
indignities
worse
than
death
the
fields
were
allowed
to
run
waste
and
forests
sprung
up
and
covered
entire
districts
which
before
the
war
had
been
under
full
cultivation
amid
these
scenes
of
misery
and
ruin
vices
were
more
marked
than
calamities
they
were
carried
to
the
utmost
pitch
of
vulgarity
both
austrian
and
swedish
generals
were
often
so
much
intoxicated
for
days
together
as
to
be
incapable
of
service
never
was
a
war
attended
by
so
many
horrors
never
was
crime
more
general
and
disgusting
so
terrible
were
the
desolations
that
it
took
germany
one
hundred
years
to
recover
from
her
losses
it
never
recovered
the
morality
and
religion
which
existed
in
the
time
of
luther
that
war
retarded
civilization
in
all
the
countries
where
it
raged
it
was
a
moral
and
physical
conflagration
but
there
is
a
god
in
this
world
and
the
evils
were
overruled
it
is
certain
that
protestantism
was
rescued
from
extermination
on
the
continent
of
europe
it
is
clear
also
that
a
barrier
was
erected
against
the
aggressions
of
austria
the
catholic
and
the
protestant
religions
were
left
unmolested
in
the
countries
where
they
prevailed
and
all
religious
sects
were
tolerated
religious
toleration
since
the
thirty
years
war
has
been
the
boast
and
glory
of
germany
we
should
feel
a
sickening
melancholy
if
something
for
the
ultimate
good
of
the
world
were
not
to
come
from
such
disasters
as
filled
germany
with
grief
and
indignation
for
a
whole
generation
for
the
immediate
effects
of
the
thirty
years
war
were
more
disastrous
than
those
of
any
war
i
have
read
of
in
the
history
of
europe
since
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
in
the
civil
wars
of
france
and
england
cities
and
villages
were
generally
spared
civilization
in
those
countries
has
scarcely
ever
been
retarded
for
more
than
a
generation
but
it
was
put
back
in
germany
for
a
century
yet
the
enormous
sacrifice
of
life
and
property
would
seem
to
show
the
high
value
which
providence
places
on
the
great
rights
of
mankind
in
comparison
with
material
prosperity
or
the
lives
of
men
what
is
spiritual
is
permanent
what
is
material
is
transient
the
early
history
of
christianity
is
the
history
of
martyrdom
five
millions
of
crusaders
perished
that
europe
might
learn
liberality
of
mind
it
took
one
hundred
years
of
contention
and
two
revolutions
to
secure
religious
toleration
in
england
france
passed
through
awful
political
hurricanes
in
order
that
feudal
injustice
might
be
removed
in
like
manner
twelve
millions
of
people
perished
in
germany
that
despotism
might
be
rebuked
fain
would
we
believe
that
what
little
was
gained
proved
a
savor
of
life
unto
life
that
seeds
of
progress
were
planted
in
that
unhappy
country
which
after
a
lapse
of
one
hundred
years
would
germinate
and
develop
a
higher
civilization
what
a
great
protestant
power
has
arisen
in
northern
germany
to
awe
and
keep
in
check
not
catholicism
merely
but
such
a
hyperborean
giant
as
russia
in
its
daring
encroachments
but
for
prussia
russia
might
have
extended
her
conquests
to
the
south
as
well
as
to
the
west
but
for
the
thirty
years
war
no
such
empire
as
prussia
would
have
been
probable
or
perhaps
possible
but
for
that
dreadful
contest
there
might
have
been
only
the
catholic
religion
among
the
descendants
of
the
teutonic
barbarians
on
the
continent
of
europe
but
for
that
war
the
austrian
empire
might
have
retained
a
political
ascendency
in
europe
until
the
french
revolution
and
such
countries
as
sweden
and
denmark
might
have
been
absorbed
in
it
as
well
as
saxony
brandenburg
and
hanover
what
a
terrible
thing
for
germany
would
have
been
the
unbroken
and
iron
despotism
of
austria
extending
its
briarean
arms
into
every
corner
of
europe
where
the
german
language
is
spoken
what
a
blow
such
a
despotism
would
have
been
to
science
literature
and
philosophy
would
catholic
austria
supreme
in
germany
have
established
schools
or
rewarded
literary
men
the
jesuits
would
have
flourished
and
triumphed
from
pomerania
to
wallachia
from
the
baltic
to
the
danube
it
may
have
taken
one
hundred
years
for
germany
to
rally
after
such
miseries
and
disasters
as
i
have
had
time
only
to
allude
to
and
not
fully
to
describe
but
see
how
gloriously
that
country
has
at
last
arisen
above
all
misfortunes
why
may
we
not
predict
a
noble
future
for
so
brave
and
honest
a
people
the
true
descendants
of
those
teutonic
conquerers
to
whom
god
gave
nearly
two
thousand
years
ago
the
possessions
and
the
lands
of
the
ancient
races
who
had
not
what
the
germans
had
a
soul
the
soul
which
hopes
and
the
soul
which
conquers
the
thirty
years
war
proved
that
liberty
is
not
a
dream
nor
truth
a
defeated
power
liberty
can
not
be
extinguished
among
such
peoples
though
oceans
may
overwhelm
it
and
mountains
may
press
it
down
it
is
the
boon
of
one
hundred
generations
the
water
of
life
distilled
from
the
tears
of
unnumbered
millions
the
precious
legacy
of
heroes
and
martyrs
who
in
different
nations
and
in
different
ages
inspired
by
the
contemplation
of
its
sublime
reality
counted
not
their
lives
dear
unto
them
if
by
the
sacrifice
of
life
this
priceless
blessing
could
be
transmitted

absolutism
cardinal
de
richelieu
is
an
illustration
of
what
can
be
done
for
the
prosperity
and
elevation
of
a
country
by
a
man
whom
we
personally
abhor
and
whose
character
is
stained
by
glaring
defects
and
vices
if
there
was
a
statesman
in
french
history
who
was
unscrupulous
selfish
tyrannical
and
cruel
that
statesman
was
the
able
and
wily
priest
who
ruled
france
during
the
latter
years
of
louis
xiii
and
yet
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
a
ruler
who
has
rendered
more
signal
services
to
the
state
or
to
the
monarch
whom
he
served
he
extricated
france
from
the
perils
of
anarchy
and
laid
the
foundation
for
the
grandeur
of
the
monarchy
under
louis
xiv
it
was
his
mission
to
create
a
strong
government
when
only
a
strong
government
could
save
the
kingdom
from
disintegration
so
that
absolutism
much
as
we
detest
it
seems
to
have
been
one
of
the
needed
forces
of
the
seventeenth
century
it
was
needed
in
france
to
restrain
the
rapacity
and
curtail
the
overgrown
power
of
feudal
nobles
whose
cabals
and
treasons
were
fatal
to
the
interests
of
law
and
order
the
assassination
of
henry
iv
was
a
great
calamity
the
government
fell
into
the
hands
of
his
widow
marie
de
médicis
a
weak
and
frivolous
woman
under
her
regency
all
kinds
of
evils
accumulated
so
many
conflicting
interests
and
animosities
existed
that
there
was
little
short
of
anarchy
there
were
not
popular
insurrections
and
rebellions
for
the
people
were
ignorant
and
were
in
bondage
to
their
feudal
masters
but
the
kingdom
was
rent
by
the
rivalries
and
intrigues
of
the
great
nobles
who
no
longer
living
in
their
isolated
castles
but
in
the
precincts
of
the
court
fought
duels
in
the
streets
plundered
the
royal
treasury
robbed
jewellers
and
coachmakers
paid
no
debts
and
treated
the
people
as
if
they
were
dogs
or
cattle
they
claimed
all
the
great
offices
of
state
and
all
high
commands
in
the
army
and
navy
sold
justice
tampered
with
the
law
quarrelled
with
the
parliaments
indeed
were
a
turbulent
haughty
and
powerful
aristocracy
who
felt
that
they
were
above
all
law
and
all
restraint
they
were
not
only
engaged
in
perpetual
intrigues
but
even
in
treasonable
correspondence
with
the
enemies
of
their
country
they
disregarded
the
honor
of
the
kingdom
and
attempted
to
divide
it
into
principalities
for
their
children
the
guises
wished
to
establish
themselves
in
provence
the
montmorencies
in
languedoc
the
longuevilles
in
picardy
the
duke
of
epernon
sought
to
retain
the
sovereignty
of
guienne
and
the
duke
of
vendôme
to
secure
the
sovereignty
of
brittany
one
wanted
to
be
constable
another
admiral
a
third
to
be
governor
of
a
province
in
order
to
tyrannize
and
enrich
themselves
like
roman
proconsuls
every
outrage
was
shamelessly
perpetrated
by
them
with
impunity
because
they
were
too
powerful
to
be
punished
they
assassinated
their
enemies
filled
the
cities
with
their
armed
retainers
and
made
war
even
on
the
government
so
that
all
central
power
was
a
mockery
the
was
humiliated
and
made
contemptible
and
was
forced
in
her
turn
and
in
to
intrigues
and
cabals
and
sought
protection
by
setting
the
nobles
up
against
each
other
and
thus
dividing
their
forces
even
the
parliaments
which
were
courts
of
law
were
full
of
antiquated
prejudices
and
sought
only
to
secure
their
own
privileges
at
one
time
siding
with
the
and
then
with
the
factious
nobles
the
huguenots
were
the
best
people
of
the
land
but
they
were
troublesome
since
they
possessed
cities
and
fortresses
and
erected
an
in
in
their
synods
and
assemblies
they
usurped
the
attributes
of
secular
rulers
and
discussed
questions
of
peace
and
war
they
entered
into
formidable
conspiracies
and
fomented
the
troubles
and
embarrassments
of
the
government
the
abjuration
of
henry
iv
had
thinned
their
ranks
and
deprived
them
of
court
influence
no
great
leaders
remained
since
they
had
been
seduced
by
fashion
the
huguenots
were
a
disappointed
and
embittered
party
hard
to
please
and
hard
to
be
governed
full
of
fierce
resentments
and
soured
by
old
recollections
they
had
obtained
religious
liberty
but
with
this
they
were
not
contented
their
spirit
was
not
unlike
that
of
the
jacobins
in
england
after
the
stuarts
were
expelled
from
the
throne
so
all
things
combined
to
produce
a
state
of
anarchy
and
discontent
feudalism
had
done
its
work
it
was
a
good
thing
on
the
dissolution
of
the
roman
empire
when
society
was
resolved
into
its
original
elements
when
barbarism
on
the
one
hand
and
superstition
on
the
other
made
the
middle
ages
funereal
dismal
violent
despairing
but
commerce
arts
and
literature
had
introduced
a
new
era
still
unformed
a
vast
chaos
of
conflicting
forces
and
yet
redeemed
by
reviving
intelligence
and
restless
daring
the
one
thing
which
society
needed
in
that
transition
period
was
a
strong
government
in
the
hands
of
kings
to
restore
law
and
develop
national
resources
now
amid
all
these
evils
richelieu
grew
up
under
the
guise
of
levity
and
pleasure
and
he
studied
and
comprehended
all
these
parties
and
factions
and
hated
them
all
all
alike
were
hostile
to
the
central
power
which
he
saw
was
necessary
to
the
preservation
of
law
and
to
the
development
of
the
resources
of
the
country
moreover
he
was
ambitious
of
power
himself
which
he
loved
as
michael
angelo
loved
art
and
palestrina
loved
music
power
was
his
and
consumed
all
other
passions
and
he
resolved
to
gain
it
in
any
way
he
could
unscrupulously
by
flatteries
by
duplicities
by
sycophancies
by
tricks
by
lies
even
by
services
that
was
his
end
he
cared
nothing
for
means
he
was
a
politician
the
progress
of
his
elevation
is
interesting
but
hideous
armand
jean
duplessis
was
born
in
of
a
noble
family
of
high
rank
he
was
designed
for
the
army
but
a
bishopric
falling
to
the
gift
of
his
family
he
was
made
a
priest
he
early
distinguished
himself
in
his
studies
for
he
was
precocious
and
had
great
abilities
at
twenty
he
was
doctor
of
the
sorbonne
and
before
he
was
he
received
from
the
pope
paul
the
emblems
of
spiritual
power
as
a
prelate
of
the
church
but
he
was
too
young
to
be
made
a
bishop
according
to
the
canons
a
difficulty
however
which
he
easily
surmounted
he
told
a
lie
to
the
pope
and
then
begged
for
an
absolution
he
then
attached
himself
to
the
worthless
favorite
of
the
concini
one
of
her
countrymen
and
through
him
to
the
queen
herself
marie
de
medicis
who
told
him
her
secrets
which
he
betrayed
when
it
suited
his
interests
when
louis
xiii
attained
his
majority
richelieu
paid
his
court
to
de
luynes
who
was
then
with
the
king
and
who
secured
him
a
cardinal
hat
and
when
this
miserable
favorite
died
this
falconer
this
keeper
of
birds
yet
duke
peer
governor
and
minister
richelieu
wound
himself
around
the
king
louis
the
most
impotent
of
all
the
bourbons
made
himself
necessary
and
became
minister
of
foreign
affairs
and
his
great
rule
began
during
all
these
seventeen
years
of
richelieu
was
to
all
appearance
the
most
amiable
man
in
france
everybody
liked
him
and
everybody
trusted
him
he
was
full
of
amenities
promises
bows
smiles
and
flatteries
he
always
advocated
the
popular
side
with
reigning
favorites
courted
all
the
great
ladies
was
seen
in
all
the
fashionable
salons
had
no
offensive
opinions
was
polite
to
everybody
was
fond
of
games
and
spectacles
frivolous
among
fools
learned
among
scholars
grave
among
functionaries
devout
among
prelates
cunning
as
a
fox
brave
as
a
lion
supple
as
a
dog
all
things
to
all
men
an
alcibiades
a
jesuit
with
no
apparent
animosities
handsome
witty
brilliant
preacher
courtier
student
as
full
of
hypocrisy
as
an
egg
is
of
meat
with
eyes
wide
open
and
thoughts
disguised
all
eyes
and
no
heart
reserved
or
communicative
as
it
suited
his
purpose
this
was
that
who
was
seeking
all
the
while
not
the
sceptre
of
the
king
but
the
power
of
the
king
should
you
say
that
this
agreeable
and
amiable
politician
who
quarrelled
with
nobody
and
revealed
nothing
to
anybody
who
had
cheated
all
parties
by
turns
was
the
man
to
save
france
to
extricate
his
country
from
all
the
evils
to
which
i
have
alluded
to
build
up
a
great
throne
even
while
he
who
sat
upon
it
was
utterly
contemptible
and
make
that
throne
the
first
in
europe
and
to
establish
absolutism
as
one
of
the
needed
forces
of
the
seventeenth
century
yet
so
it
was
and
his
work
was
all
the
more
difficult
when
the
character
of
the
king
is
considered
louis
xiii
was
a
different
kind
of
man
from
his
father
henry
iv
and
his
grandson
louis
xiv
he
had
no
striking
characteristics
but
feebleness
and
timidity
and
love
of
ignoble
pleasures
he
had
no
ambitions
or
powerful
passions
was
feeble
and
sickly
from
a
child
ruled
at
one
time
by
his
mother
and
then
by
a
falconer
and
apparently
taking
but
little
interest
in
affairs
of
state
but
if
it
was
difficult
to
gain
ascendency
over
such
a
frivolous
and
inglorious
sardanapalus
it
was
easy
to
retain
it
when
this
ascendency
was
once
acquired
for
richelieu
made
him
comprehend
the
dangers
which
menaced
his
life
and
his
throne
that
some
very
able
man
must
be
intrusted
with
supreme
delegated
power
who
would
rule
for
the
benefit
of
him
he
served
a
servant
and
yet
a
master
like
metternich
in
austria
after
the
wars
of
napoleon
a
man
whose
business
and
aim
were
to
exalt
absolutism
on
a
throne
moreover
he
so
complicated
public
affairs
that
his
services
were
indispensable
nobody
could
fill
his
place
also
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
king
was
isolated
and
without
counsellors
whom
he
could
trust
after
the
death
of
de
luynes
he
had
no
bosom
friend
he
was
surrounded
with
perplexities
and
secret
enemies
his
mother
who
had
been
regent
defied
his
authority
his
brothers
sought
to
wear
his
crown
the
nobles
conspired
against
his
throne
the
protestants
threatened
another
civil
war
the
parliaments
thought
only
of
retaining
their
privileges
the
finances
were
disordered
the
treasures
which
henry
iv
had
accumulated
had
been
squandered
in
bribing
the
great
nobles
foreign
enemies
had
invaded
the
soil
of
france
evils
and
dangers
were
accumulating
on
every
side
with
such
terrific
force
as
to
jeopardize
the
very
existence
of
the
monarchy
and
one
necessity
became
apparent
even
to
the
weak
mind
of
the
king
that
he
must
delegate
his
power
to
some
able
man
who
though
he
might
rule
unscrupulously
and
tyrannically
would
yet
be
faithful
to
the
crown
and
establish
the
central
power
for
the
benefit
of
his
heirs
and
the
welfare
of
the
state
now
richelieu
was
just
the
man
he
needed
just
such
a
man
as
the
times
required
a
man
raised
up
to
do
important
work
like
cromwell
in
england
like
bismarck
in
prussia
like
cavour
in
italy
doubtless
a
great
hypocrite
yet
sincere
in
the
conviction
that
a
strong
government
was
the
great
necessity
of
his
country
a
great
scoundrel
yet
a
patriotic
and
wise
statesman
who
loved
his
country
with
the
ardor
of
a
mirabeau
while
nobody
loved
him
besides
he
loved
absolutism
both
because
he
was
by
nature
a
tyrant
and
because
he
was
a
member
of
the
roman
catholic
hierarchy
he
called
to
mind
old
rome
under
the
caesars
and
mediaeval
rome
under
the
popes
and
what
a
central
authority
had
effected
for
civilization
in
times
of
anarchy
and
in
times
of
darkness
and
superstition
and
the
king
to
him
was
a
sort
of
vicegerent
of
divine
power
clothed
in
authority
based
on
divine
right
the
idea
of
kings
in
the
middle
ages
the
state
was
his
to
be
managed
as
a
man
manages
his
farm
as
a
south
carolinian
once
managed
his
slaves
the
idea
that
political
power
properly
emanates
from
the
people
the
idea
of
rousseau
and
jefferson
never
once
occurred
to
him
nor
even
political
power
in
the
hands
of
aristocrats
fettered
by
a
constitution
and
amenable
to
the
nation
a
constitutional
monarchy
existed
nowhere
except
perhaps
in
england
unrestricted
and
absolute
power
in
the
hands
of
a
king
was
the
only
government
he
believed
in
the
king
might
be
feeble
in
which
case
he
could
delegate
his
power
to
ministers
or
he
might
be
imbecile
in
which
case
he
might
be
virtually
dethroned
but
his
royal
rights
were
sacred
his
authority
incontestable
and
consecrated
by
all
usage
and
precedent
yet
while
richelieu
would
uphold
the
authority
of
the
crown
as
supreme
and
absolute
he
would
not
destroy
the
prestige
of
the
aristocracy
for
he
was
a
nobleman
himself
he
belonged
to
their
class
he
believed
in
caste
in
privileges
in
monopolies
therefore
he
would
not
annul
either
rank
or
honor
the
nobles
were
welcome
to
retain
their
stars
and
orders
and
ribbons
and
heraldic
distinctions
even
their
parks
and
palaces
and
falcons
and
hounds
they
were
a
favored
class
that
feudalism
had
introduced
and
ages
had
indorsed
but
even
they
must
be
subservient
to
the
crown
from
which
their
honors
emanated
and
hence
to
order
and
law
of
which
the
king
was
the
keeper
they
must
be
subjects
of
the
government
as
well
as
allies
and
supporters
the
government
was
royal
not
aristocratic
the
privileges
of
the
nobility
were
social
rather
than
political
although
the
great
offices
of
state
were
intrusted
to
them
as
a
favor
not
as
a
right
as
simply
servants
of
a
royal
master
whose
interests
they
were
required
to
defend
some
of
them
were
allied
by
blood
with
the
sovereign
and
received
marks
of
his
special
favor
but
their
authority
was
derived
from
him
richelieu
was
not
unpatriotic
he
wished
to
see
france
powerful
united
and
prosperous
but
powerful
as
a
monarchy
united
under
a
king
and
prosperous
for
the
benefit
of
the
privileged
orders
not
for
the
plebeian
people
who
toiled
for
supercilious
masters
the
people
were
of
no
account
politically
were
as
unimportant
as
slaves
to
be
protected
in
life
and
property
that
they
might
thrive
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
ruled
them
so
when
richelieu
became
prime
minister
and
felt
secure
in
his
seat
knowing
how
necessary
to
the
king
his
services
were
he
laid
aside
his
amiable
manners
as
a
politician
and
determined
as
a
statesman
to
carry
out
remorselessly
and
rigidly
his
plans
for
the
exaltation
of
the
monarchy
and
the
moment
he
spoke
at
the
his
genius
predominated
all
saw
that
a
great
power
had
arisen
that
he
was
a
master
and
would
be
obeyed
and
would
execute
his
plans
with
no
sentimentalities
but
coldly
fixedly
like
a
man
of
blood
and
iron
indifferent
to
all
obstacles
he
was
a
man
who
could
rule
and
therefore
on
carlyle
theory
a
man
who
ought
to
rule
because
he
was
strong
there
is
something
imposing
i
grant
in
this
executive
strength
it
does
not
make
a
man
interesting
but
it
makes
him
feared
every
ruler
in
fact
every
man
intrusted
with
executive
power
especially
in
stormy
times
should
be
resolute
unflinching
with
a
will
dominating
over
everything
with
courage
pluck
backbone
be
he
king
or
prime
minister
or
the
superintendent
of
a
railway
or
director
of
a
lunatic
asylum
or
president
of
a
college
no
matter
whether
the
sphere
be
large
or
small
the
administration
of
power
requires
energy
will
promptness
of
action
without
favor
and
without
fear
and
if
such
a
person
rules
well
he
will
be
respected
but
if
he
rules
unwisely
if
capricious
unjust
cruel
vindictive
he
may
be
borne
for
a
while
until
patience
is
exhausted
and
indignation
becomes
terrible
a
passion
of
vengeance
like
that
which
overthrew
strafford
wise
tyrants
like
peter
and
frederic
the
great
will
be
endured
from
their
devotion
to
public
interests
but
unwise
tyrants
ruling
for
or
pleasure
will
be
hurled
from
power
or
assassinated
like
nero
or
commodus
as
the
only
way
to
get
rid
of
the
miseries
they
inflict
now
of
the
class
of
wise
and
enlightened
tyrants
was
richelieu
his
greatness
was
in
his
will
sagacity
watchfulness
and
devotion
to
public
affairs
factions
could
not
oust
him
because
he
was
strong
the
king
would
not
part
with
him
because
he
was
faithful
posterity
will
not
curse
him
because
he
laid
the
foundation
of
the
political
greatness
of
his
country
i
do
not
praise
his
system
of
government
on
abstract
principles
i
feel
that
it
is
against
the
liberties
of
mankind
nor
is
it
in
accordance
with
the
progress
of
government
in
our
modern
times
all
the
successive
changes
which
reforms
and
revolutions
have
wrought
have
been
towards
representative
and
constitutional
governments
as
in
england
and
france
in
the
nineteenth
century
absolutism
or
caesarism
is
only
adapted
to
people
in
primitive
or
anarchical
states
of
society
as
in
old
rome
or
rome
under
the
popes
it
is
at
the
best
a
necessary
tyranny
made
so
by
the
disorders
and
evils
of
life
it
can
be
commended
only
when
men
are
worse
than
governments
when
they
are
to
be
coerced
like
wild
beasts
or
lunatics
or
scoundrels
when
there
is
universal
plunder
lying
cheating
and
murdering
when
laws
are
a
mockery
and
when
demagogues
reign
when
all
public
interests
are
scandalously
sacrificed
for
private
emolument
then
absolutism
may
for
a
time
be
necessary
but
only
for
a
time
unless
we
assume
that
men
can
never
govern
themselves
in
that
state
of
society
into
which
france
was
plunged
during
the
regency
of
marie
de
médicis
and
at
which
i
have
glanced
absolutism
was
perhaps
a
needed
force
then
richelieu
its
great
modern
representative
arose
a
model
statesman
in
the
eyes
of
peter
the
great
but
he
was
not
to
reign
and
trample
all
other
powers
beneath
his
feet
without
a
memorable
struggle
three
great
forces
were
arrayed
against
him
these
were
the
huguenots
the
nobles
and
the
parliaments
the
protestant
the
feudal
and
the
legal
elements
of
society
in
france
the
people
at
least
the
peasantry
did
not
rise
up
against
him
they
were
powerless
and
too
unenlightened
the
priests
sustained
him
and
the
common
people
acquiesced
in
his
rigid
rule
for
he
established
law
and
order
he
began
his
labors
in
behalf
of
absolutism
by
suppressing
the
huguenots
that
was
the
only
political
party
which
was
urgent
for
its
rights
they
were
an
intelligent
party
of
tradesmen
and
small
farmers
they
were
plebeian
but
conscientious
and
aspiring
they
were
not
contented
alone
to
worship
god
according
to
the
charter
which
henry
iv
had
granted
but
they
sought
political
power
and
they
were
so
unfortunate
as
to
be
guilty
of
cabals
and
intrigues
inconsistent
with
a
central
power
they
were
factious
and
were
not
disposed
to
submit
to
legitimate
authority
they
had
declined
in
numbers
and
influence
they
had
even
degenerated
in
religious
life
but
they
were
still
powerful
and
dangerous
foes
they
had
retreated
to
their
strong
fortress
of
la
rochelle
resolved
if
attacked
to
fight
once
again
the
whole
power
of
the
monarchy
they
put
themselves
in
a
false
position
they
wanted
more
than
the
edict
of
nantes
had
guaranteed
unfortunately
for
them
they
had
no
leaders
worthy
to
marshal
their
forces
fashion
and
the
influence
of
the
court
had
seduced
their
men
of
rank
nor
had
they
the
enthusiasm
which
had
secured
victory
at
ivry
nor
could
they
contend
openly
in
the
field
they
were
obliged
to
intrench
themselves
in
an
impregnable
fortress
there
they
deemed
they
could
defy
their
enemy
they
even
invoked
the
aid
of
england
and
thus
introduced
foreign
enemies
on
the
soil
of
france
which
was
they
put
themselves
in
the
attitude
of
rebels
against
the
government
and
so
long
as
english
ships
with
supplies
could
go
in
and
out
of
their
harbor
they
could
not
be
conquered
richelieu
clad
in
mail
a
surveyed
with
disgust
their
strong
defences
and
their
open
harbor
his
artillery
was
of
no
use
nor
his
lines
of
circumvallation
so
he
put
his
brain
in
motion
and
studied
quintus
curtius
he
remembered
what
alexander
did
at
the
siege
of
tyre
he
constructed
a
vast
dyke
of
stone
and
timber
and
iron
across
the
harbor
in
some
places
twelve
hundred
feet
deep
and
thus
cut
off
all
egress
and
ingress
the
english
under
buckingham
departed
unable
to
render
further
assistance
the
capture
then
was
only
a
work
of
time
genius
had
hemmed
the
city
in
and
famine
soon
did
the
rest
cats
dogs
and
vermin
became
luxuries
the
starving
women
beseeched
the
inexorable
enemy
for
permission
to
retire
they
remembered
the
mercy
that
henry
iv
had
shown
at
the
siege
of
paris
but
war
in
the
hands
of
masters
has
no
favors
to
grant
conquerors
have
no
tears
the
huguenots
as
rebels
had
no
hope
but
in
unconditional
submission
they
yielded
it
reluctantly
but
not
until
famine
had
done
its
work
and
they
never
raised
their
heads
again
their
spirit
was
broken
they
were
conquered
and
at
the
mercy
of
the
crown
destined
in
the
next
reign
to
be
cruelly
and
most
wantonly
persecuted
hunted
as
heretics
by
dragonnades
and
executioners
at
the
bidding
of
louis
until
four
hundred
thousand
were
executed
or
driven
from
the
kingdom
but
richelieu
was
not
such
a
bigot
as
louis
xiv
he
was
a
statesman
and
took
enlightened
views
of
the
welfare
of
the
country
therefore
he
contented
himself
with
destroying
the
fortifications
of
la
rochelle
filling
up
its
ditches
and
changing
its
government
he
continued
in
a
modified
form
the
religious
privileges
conceded
by
the
edict
of
nantes
but
he
kept
a
strict
watch
humiliated
the
body
by
withholding
civil
equalities
and
offices
in
the
army
and
navy
treating
with
disdain
their
ministers
and
taking
away
their
social
rank
so
that
they
became
plebeian
and
unimportant
he
pursued
the
same
course
that
the
english
government
adopted
in
reference
to
dissenters
in
the
eighteenth
century
when
they
were
excluded
from
oxford
and
cambridge
and
church
so
that
protestantism
in
france
after
the
fall
of
la
rochelle
never
asserted
its
dignity
in
spite
of
bibles
consistories
and
schools
degraded
at
court
deprived
of
the
great
offices
of
the
state
despised
rejected
and
persecuted
it
languished
and
declined
having
subdued
the
huguenots
richelieu
turned
his
attention
to
the
nobles
the
most
worthless
arrogant
and
powerful
of
all
the
nobility
of
europe
men
who
made
royalty
a
mockery
and
law
a
name
i
have
alluded
to
their
intrigues
ambition
and
insolence
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
be
humiliated
decimated
and
punished
if
central
power
was
to
be
respected
so
he
cut
off
their
towering
heads
exiled
and
imprisoned
them
whenever
they
violated
the
laws
or
threatened
the
security
of
the
throne
or
the
peace
of
the
realm
as
individuals
they
hated
him
and
conspired
against
his
rule
had
they
combined
they
would
have
been
more
powerful
than
he
but
they
were
too
quarrelsome
envious
and
to
combine
the
person
who
hated
richelieu
most
fiercely
and
bitterly
was
the
widow
of
henry
regent
during
the
minority
of
louis
xiii
and
no
wonder
for
he
had
cheated
her
and
betrayed
her
she
was
a
very
formidable
enemy
having
a
great
ascendency
over
the
mind
of
her
son
the
king
and
once
it
is
said
she
had
so
powerfully
wrought
upon
him
by
her
envenomed
sarcasms
in
the
palace
of
the
luxembourg
where
she
lived
in
royal
state
that
the
king
had
actually
taken
the
parchment
in
his
hand
to
sign
the
disgrace
of
his
minister
but
he
was
watched
by
an
eye
that
never
slept
richelieu
suddenly
appearing
at
the
critical
moment
from
behind
the
tapestries
where
he
had
concealed
himself
fronted
and
defied
his
enemy
the
king
bewildered
had
not
nerve
enough
to
face
his
own
servant
who
however
made
him
comprehend
the
dangers
which
surrounded
his
throne
and
person
and
compelled
him
to
part
with
his
mother
the
only
woman
he
ever
loved
and
without
permitting
her
to
imprint
upon
his
brow
her
own
last
farewell
and
the
world
saw
the
extraordinary
spectacle
of
this
once
powerful
queen
the
mother
of
a
long
line
of
kings
compelled
to
lead
a
fugitive
life
from
court
to
court
repulsed
from
england
by
her
refused
a
shelter
in
holland
insulted
by
spain
neglected
by
rome
and
finally
obliged
to
crave
an
asylum
from
rubens
the
painter
and
driven
from
one
of
his
houses
forced
to
hide
herself
in
cologne
where
deserted
by
all
her
children
and
so
reduced
by
poverty
as
to
break
up
the
very
furniture
of
her
room
for
fuel
she
perished
miserably
between
four
empty
walls
on
a
wretched
bed
destitute
helpless
heartbroken
and
alone
such
was
the
power
and
such
was
the
vengeance
of
the
cardinal
on
the
highest
personage
in
france
such
was
the
dictation
of
a
priest
to
a
king
who
personally
disliked
him
such
was
his
ascendency
not
by
druidical
weapons
but
by
genius
presenting
reasons
of
state
the
next
most
powerful
personage
in
france
was
the
duke
of
orleans
brother
of
the
king
who
sought
to
steal
his
sceptre
as
he
was
detected
in
treasonable
correspondence
with
spain
he
became
a
culprit
but
was
spared
after
making
a
humiliating
confession
and
submission
but
condé
the
first
prince
of
the
blood
was
shut
up
in
prison
and
the
powerful
duke
of
guise
was
exiled
richelieu
took
away
from
the
duke
of
bouillon
his
sovereignty
of
sedan
forced
the
proud
epernon
to
ask
pardon
on
his
knees
drove
away
from
the
kingdom
the
duke
of
vendôme
natural
brother
of
the
king
executed
the
duke
of
montmorency
whose
family
traced
an
unbroken
lineage
to
pharamond
confined
marshal
bassompierre
to
the
bastile
arrested
marshal
marillac
at
the
head
of
a
conquering
army
cut
off
the
head
of
grand
equerry
and
favorite
of
the
king
and
executed
on
the
scaffold
the
counts
of
chalais
and
bouteville
all
these
men
were
among
the
proudest
and
most
powerful
nobles
in
europe
they
all
lived
like
princes
and
had
princely
revenues
and
grand
offices
but
had
been
caught
with
arms
in
their
hands
or
in
treasonable
correspondence
what
hope
for
ordinary
culprits
when
the
proudest
feudal
nobles
were
executed
or
exiled
like
common
malefactors
neither
rank
nor
services
could
screen
them
from
punishment
the
great
minister
had
no
mercy
and
no
delay
even
for
the
favorites
of
royalty
nay
the
king
himself
became
his
puppet
and
was
forced
to
part
with
his
friends
his
family
his
mistresses
and
his
pleasures
some
of
the
prime
ministers
of
kings
have
had
as
much
power
as
richelieu
but
no
minister
before
or
since
has
ruled
the
monarch
himself
with
such
an
iron
sway
how
weak
the
king
or
how
great
the
minister
the
third
great
force
which
richelieu
crushed
was
the
parliament
of
paris
it
had
the
privilege
of
registering
the
decrees
of
the
king
and
hence
was
a
check
the
only
check
on
royal
authority
unless
the
king
came
in
person
into
the
assembly
and
enforced
his
decree
by
what
was
called
a
bed
of
justice
this
body
however
was
judicial
rather
than
legislative
made
up
of
pedantic
and
aristocratic
lawyers
who
could
be
troublesome
we
get
some
idea
of
the
humiliation
of
this
assembly
of
lawyers
and
nobles
from
the
speech
of
omer
talon
the
greatest
lawyer
of
the
realm
when
called
upon
to
express
the
sentiments
of
his
illustrious
body
to
the
king
at
a
bed
of
justice
happy
should
we
be
most
gracious
sovereign
if
we
could
obtain
any
favor
worthy
of
the
honor
which
we
derive
from
your
majesty
presence
but
the
entry
of
your
sacred
person
into
our
assembly
unfits
us
for
our
functions
and
inasmuch
as
the
throne
on
which
you
are
seated
is
a
light
that
dazzles
us
bow
if
it
please
you
the
heavens
which
you
inhabit
and
after
the
example
of
the
eternal
sovereign
whose
image
you
bear
condescend
to
visit
us
with
your
gracious
mercy
what
a
contrast
to
this
servile
speech
was
the
conduct
of
the
english
parliament
about
this
time
in
its
memorable
resistance
to
charles
and
how
different
would
have
been
the
political
destinies
of
the
english
people
if
stratford
just
such
a
man
as
richelieu
had
succeeded
in
his
schemes
but
in
england
the
parliament
was
backed
by
the
nation
at
least
by
the
middle
classes
in
france
the
people
had
then
no
political
aspirations
among
them
a
cromwell
could
not
have
arisen
since
a
cromwell
could
not
have
been
sustained
thus
richelieu
by
will
and
genius
conquered
all
his
foes
in
order
to
uphold
the
throne
and
thus
elevate
the
nation
for
as
sir
james
stephen
says
the
grandeur
of
the
monarchy
and
the
welfare
of
france
with
him
were
but
convertible
terms
he
made
the
throne
the
first
in
europe
even
while
he
who
sat
upon
it
was
personally
contemptible
he
gave
lustre
to
the
monarchy
while
he
himself
was
an
unarmed
priest
it
was
a
splendid
fiction
to
make
the
king
nominally
so
powerful
while
really
he
was
so
feeble
but
royalty
was
not
a
fiction
under
his
successor
how
respectable
did
richelieu
make
the
monarchy
what
a
deep
foundation
did
he
lay
for
royalty
under
louis
what
a
magnificent
inheritance
did
he
bequeath
to
that
monarch
nothing
was
done
for
forty
years
which
he
had
not
foreseen
and
prepared
his
successor
mazarin
only
prospered
so
far
as
he
followed
out
his
instructions
and
the
star
of
louis
xiv
did
not
pale
so
long
as
the
policy
which
richelieu
bequeathed
was
the
rule
of
his
public
acts
the
magnificence
of
louis
was
only
the
sequel
of
the
energy
and
genius
of
richelieu
versailles
was
really
the
gift
of
him
who
built
the
palais
royal
the
services
of
richelieu
to
france
did
not
end
with
centralizing
power
around
the
throne
he
enlarged
the
limits
of
the
kingdom
and
subdued
her
foreign
enemies
great
rivers
and
mountains
became
the
national
boundaries
within
which
it
was
easy
to
preserve
conquests
he
was
not
ambitious
of
foreign
domination
he
simply
wished
to
make
the
kingdom
impregnable
had
napoleon
pursued
this
policy
he
could
never
have
been
overthrown
and
his
dynasty
would
have
been
established
it
was
the
policy
of
elizabeth
and
of
cromwell
i
do
not
say
that
richelieu
did
not
enter
upon
foreign
wars
but
it
was
to
restore
the
balance
of
power
not
to
add
kingdoms
to
the
empire
he
rendered
assistance
to
gustavus
adolphus
in
spite
of
the
protests
of
rome
and
the
disgust
of
catholic
powers
in
order
to
prevent
the
dangerous
ascendency
of
austria
thus
setting
an
example
for
william
and
pitt
himself
in
his
warfare
against
napoleon
in
these
days
we
should
prefer
to
see
the
balance
of
power
maintained
by
a
congress
of
nations
rather
than
by
vast
military
preparations
and
standing
armies
which
eat
out
the
resources
of
nations
but
in
the
seventeenth
century
there
was
no
other
way
to
maintain
this
balance
than
by
opposing
armies
nor
did
richelieu
seek
to
maintain
the
peace
of
europe
by
force
alone
never
was
there
a
more
astute
and
profound
diplomatist
his
emissaries
were
in
every
court
with
intrigues
very
hard
to
be
baffled
he
equalled
metternich
or
talleyrand
in
his
profound
dissimulation
for
european
diplomacy
has
ever
been
based
on
this
while
he
built
up
absolutism
in
france
he
did
not
alienate
other
governments
so
that
like
cromwell
he
made
his
nation
respected
abroad
his
conquest
of
roussillon
prepared
the
way
for
the
famous
treaty
of
the
pyrenees
under
the
administration
of
mazarin
while
vigorous
in
war
his
policy
was
on
the
whole
pacific
like
that
of
all
catholic
priests
who
have
held
power
in
france
he
loved
glory
indeed
but
like
sully
and
colbert
he
also
wished
to
develop
the
national
resources
and
as
indeed
all
enlightened
statesmen
from
moses
downward
have
sought
to
do
he
wished
to
make
the
country
strong
for
defence
rather
than
offence
he
showed
great
sagacity
as
well
as
an
enlightened
mind
the
ablest
men
were
placed
in
office
the
army
and
navy
were
reorganized
corruption
and
peculation
on
the
part
of
officials
were
severely
punished
the
royal
revenue
was
increased
roads
bridges
canals
were
built
and
repaired
and
public
improvements
were
made
the
fine
arts
were
encouraged
and
even
learning
was
rewarded
it
was
he
who
founded
the
french
academy
although
he
excluded
from
it
men
of
original
genius
whose
views
he
did
not
like
law
and
order
were
certainly
restored
and
anarchy
ceased
to
reign
the
rights
of
property
were
established
and
the
finances
freed
from
embarrassments
so
his
rigid
rule
tended
to
the
elevation
of
france
absolutism
proved
necessary
in
his
day
and
under
his
circumstances
when
arraigned
at
the
bar
of
posterity
he
claims
like
napoleon
to
be
judged
for
his
services
and
not
for
his
defects
of
character
these
defects
will
forever
make
him
odious
in
spite
of
his
services
i
hardly
know
a
more
repulsive
benefactor
he
was
vain
cold
heartless
rigid
and
proud
he
had
no
amiable
weakness
his
smile
was
a
dagger
and
his
friendship
was
a
snare
he
was
a
hypocrite
and
a
tyrant
he
had
no
pity
on
a
fallen
foe
and
even
when
bending
under
the
infirmities
of
age
and
in
the
near
prospect
of
death
his
inexorable
temper
was
never
for
a
moment
subdued
the
execution
of
and
de
thou
took
place
when
he
had
one
foot
in
his
grave
he
deceived
everybody
sent
his
spies
into
the
bosom
of
families
and
made
expediency
the
law
of
his
public
life
but
it
is
nothing
to
the
philosophic
student
of
history
that
he
built
the
palais
royal
or
squandered
riches
with
roman
prodigality
or
rewarded
players
or
enriched
marion
delorme
or
clad
himself
in
mail
before
la
rochelle
or
persecuted
his
early
friends
or
robbed
the
monasteries
or
made
a
spy
of
father
joseph
or
exiled
the
or
kept
the
king
in
bondage
or
sent
his
enemies
to
the
scaffold
these
things
are
all
against
him
and
make
him
appear
in
a
repulsive
light
but
if
he
brought
order
out
of
confusion
and
gave
a
blow
to
feudalism
and
destroyed
anarchies
and
promoted
law
and
developed
the
resources
of
his
country
making
that
country
formidable
and
honorable
and
constructed
a
vast
machinery
of
government
by
which
france
was
kept
together
for
a
century
and
would
have
fallen
to
pieces
without
it
then
there
is
another
way
to
survey
this
bad
man
and
we
view
him
not
only
as
a
great
statesman
and
ruler
but
as
an
instrument
of
providence
raised
up
as
a
terror
to
we
may
hate
absolutism
but
must
at
the
same
time
remember
that
there
are
no
settled
principles
of
government
any
more
than
of
political
economy
that
is
the
best
government
which
is
best
adapted
to
the
exigency
of
that
human
society
which
at
the
time
it
serves
republicanism
would
not
do
in
china
any
more
than
despotism
in
new
england
bad
men
somehow
or
other
must
be
coerced
and
punished
the
more
prevalent
is
depravity
so
much
the
more
necessary
is
despotic
vigor
it
will
be
so
to
the
end
of
time
it
is
all
nonsense
to
dream
of
liberty
with
a
substratum
of
folly
and
vice
unless
evils
can
be
remedied
by
the
public
itself
giving
power
to
the
laws
which
the
people
create
then
physical
force
hard
and
cold
tyranny
must
inevitably
take
the
place
no
country
will
long
endure
anarchy
and
then
the
hardest
characters
may
prove
the
greatest
benefactors
it
is
on
this
principle
that
i
am
reconciled
to
the
occasional
rule
of
despots
and
when
i
see
a
bad
man
like
richelieu
grasping
power
to
be
used
for
the
good
of
a
nation
i
have
faith
to
believe
it
to
be
ordered
wisely
when
men
are
good
and
honest
and
brave
we
shall
have
washingtons
when
they
are
selfish
and
lawless
god
will
send
richelieus
and
napoleons
if
he
has
good
things
in
store
for
the
future
even
as
he
sends
neros
and
diocletians
when
a
nation
is
doomed
to
destruction
by
incurable
rottenness
and
yet
absolutism
in
itself
is
not
to
be
defended
it
is
what
enlightened
nations
are
now
striving
to
abolish
it
is
needed
only
under
certain
circumstances
if
it
were
to
be
perpetuated
in
any
nation
it
would
be
satanic
it
is
endurable
only
because
it
may
be
destroyed
when
it
has
answered
its
end
and
like
all
human
institutions
it
will
become
corrupted
it
was
shamefully
abused
under
louis
xiv
and
louis
xv
but
when
corrupted
and
abused
it
has
like
slavery
all
the
elements
of
certain
decay
and
ruin
the
abuse
of
power
will
lead
to
its
own
destruction
even
as
undue
haste
in
the
acquisition
of

revolution
the
most
difficult
character
in
history
to
treat
critically
and
the
easiest
to
treat
rhetorically
perhaps
is
oliver
cromwell
after
two
centuries
and
more
he
is
still
a
puzzle
his
name
like
that
of
napoleon
is
a
doubt
some
regard
him
with
unmingled
admiration
some
detest
him
as
a
usurper
and
many
look
upon
him
as
a
hypocrite
nobody
questions
his
ability
and
his
talents
were
so
great
that
some
bow
down
to
him
on
that
account
out
of
reverence
for
strength
like
carlyle
on
the
whole
he
is
a
popular
idol
not
for
his
strength
but
for
his
cause
since
he
represents
the
progressive
party
in
his
day
in
behalf
of
liberty
at
least
until
his
protectorate
began
then
new
issues
arose
and
while
he
appeared
as
a
great
patriot
and
enlightened
ruler
he
yet
reigned
as
an
absolute
monarch
basing
his
power
on
a
standing
army
but
whatever
may
be
said
of
cromwell
as
statesman
general
or
ruler
his
career
was
remarkable
and
exceedingly
interesting
his
character
too
was
unique
and
original
hence
we
are
never
weary
of
discussing
him
in
studying
his
character
and
career
we
also
have
our
minds
directed
to
the
great
ideas
of
his
tumultuous
and
agitated
age
for
he
like
napoleon
was
the
product
of
revolution
he
was
the
offspring
of
mighty
ideas
he
did
not
create
them
original
thinkers
set
them
in
motion
as
rousseau
enunciated
the
ideas
which
led
to
the
french
revolution
the
great
thinkers
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
were
divines
the
men
whom
the
reformation
produced
it
was
luther
preaching
the
right
of
private
judgment
and
calvin
pushing
out
the
doctrine
of
the
majesty
of
god
to
its
remotest
logical
sequence
and
latimer
appealing
to
every
man
personal
responsibility
to
god
and
gustavus
adolphus
fighting
for
religious
liberty
and
the
huguenots
protesting
against
religious
persecution
and
thomas
cromwell
sweeping
away
the
abominations
of
the
papacy
and
the
geneva
divines
who
settled
in
england
during
the
reign
of
elizabeth
it
was
all
these
that
produced
oliver
cromwell
he
was
a
puritan
and
hence
he
was
a
reformer
not
in
church
matters
merely
but
in
all
those
things
which
are
connected
with
civil
liberty
for
there
is
as
close
a
connection
between
protestantism
and
liberty
as
between
catholicism
and
absolutism
the
puritans
intensely
hated
everything
which
reminded
them
of
rome
even
the
holidays
of
the
church
organs
cathedrals
and
the
rich
dresses
of
the
clergy
they
even
tried
to
ignore
christmas
and
easter
though
consecrated
by
the
early
church
they
hated
the
middle
ages
looked
with
disgust
upon
the
past
and
longed
to
try
experiments
not
only
in
religion
but
in
politics
and
social
life
the
only
antiquity
which
had
authority
to
them
was
the
jewish
commonwealth
because
it
was
a
theocracy
and
recognized
god
almighty
as
the
supreme
ruler
of
the
world
hence
they
adhered
to
the
strictness
of
the
jewish
sabbath
and
baptized
their
children
with
hebrew
names
now
to
such
a
people
stern
lofty
ascetic
legal
spiritual
conservative
of
whatever
the
bible
reveals
yet
progressive
and
ardent
for
reforms
the
rule
of
the
stuarts
was
intolerable
it
was
intolerable
because
it
seemed
to
lean
towards
catholicism
and
because
it
was
tyrannical
and
averse
to
changes
the
king
was
ruled
by
favorites
and
these
favorites
were
either
bigots
in
religion
like
archbishop
laud
or
were
tyrannical
or
unscrupulous
in
their
efforts
to
sustain
the
king
in
despotic
measures
and
crush
popular
agitations
like
the
earl
of
strafford
or
were
men
of
pleasure
and
vanity
like
the
duke
of
buckingham
charles
was
detested
by
the
puritans
even
more
than
his
father
james
they
looked
upon
him
as
more
than
half
a
papist
a
despot
utterly
insincere
indifferent
to
the
welfare
of
the
country
intent
only
on
exalting
himself
and
his
throne
at
the
expense
of
the
interests
of
the
people
whose
aspirations
he
scorned
and
whose
rights
he
trampled
upon
in
his
eyes
they
had
no
only
and
duties
to
him
as
an
anointed
sovereign
to
rule
as
he
liked
with
parliaments
or
without
parliaments
yea
to
impose
taxes
arbitrarily
and
grant
odious
monopolies
for
the
state
was
his
to
be
managed
as
a
man
would
manage
a
farm
and
those
who
resisted
this
encroachment
on
the
liberties
of
the
nation
were
to
be
fined
imprisoned
executed
as
pestilent
disturbers
of
the
public
peace
he
would
form
dangerous
alliances
with
catholic
powers
marry
his
children
to
catholic
princes
appoint
catholics
to
high
office
and
compromise
the
dignity
of
the
nation
as
a
protestant
state
his
ministers
his
judges
his
high
officials
were
simply
his
tools
and
perpetually
insulted
the
nation
by
their
arrogance
their
venality
and
their
shameful
disregard
of
the
constitution
in
short
he
seemed
bent
on
imposing
a
tyrannical
yoke
hard
to
be
endured
and
to
punish
unlawfully
those
who
resisted
it
or
even
murmured
against
it
he
would
shackle
the
press
and
muzzle
the
members
of
parliament
thus
did
this
king
appear
to
the
puritans
at
this
time
a
large
and
influential
party
chiefly
presbyterian
and
headed
by
many
men
of
rank
and
character
all
of
whom
detested
the
roman
catholic
religion
as
the
source
of
all
religious
and
political
evils
and
who
did
not
scruple
to
call
the
papacy
by
the
hardest
names
such
as
the
scarlet
mother
antichrist
and
the
like
they
had
seceded
from
the
established
church
in
the
reign
of
elizabeth
and
became
what
was
then
called
had
they
been
treated
wisely
had
any
respect
been
shown
to
their
opinions
and
rights
for
the
right
of
worshipping
god
according
to
individual
conscience
is
the
central
and
basal
pillar
of
protestantism
had
this
undoubted
right
of
private
judgment
the
great
emancipating
idea
of
that
age
been
respected
the
puritans
would
have
sought
relief
in
constitutional
resistance
for
they
were
conservative
and
loyal
as
english
people
ever
have
been
even
in
canada
and
australia
they
were
not
bent
on
they
only
desired
so
their
representatives
in
parliament
framed
the
famous
petition
of
right
in
which
were
reasserted
the
principles
of
constitutional
liberty
this
earnest
loyal
but
angry
parliament
being
troublesome
was
dissolved
and
charles
undertook
for
eleven
years
to
reign
without
one
against
all
precedents
with
stafford
and
laud
for
his
chief
advisers
and
ministers
he
reigned
by
star
chamber
decrees
courts
issuing
proclamations
resorting
to
forced
loans
tampering
with
justice
removing
judges
imprisoning
obnoxious
men
without
trial
insulting
and
humiliating
the
puritans
and
openly
encouraging
a
religion
of
millineries
and
upholsteries
not
only
illegally
but
against
the
wishes
and
sentiments
of
the
better
part
of
the
nation
thus
undermining
his
own
throne
for
all
thrones
are
based
on
the
love
of
the
people
the
financial
difficulties
of
the
king
for
the
most
absolute
of
kings
can
not
extort
the
money
they
want
compelled
him
to
assemble
another
parliament
at
an
alarming
crisis
of
popular
indignation
which
he
did
not
see
when
popular
leaders
began
to
say
that
even
kings
must
rule
the
people
and
not
the
people
this
new
parliament
with
hampden
and
pym
for
leaders
though
fierce
and
aggressive
would
have
been
contented
with
constitutional
reform
like
mirabeau
at
one
period
but
the
king
obstinate
blinded
would
not
accept
reform
he
would
reign
like
the
bourbons
or
not
at
all
the
reforms
which
the
parliament
desired
were
reasonable
and
just
it
would
abolish
arbitrary
arrests
the
star
chamber
decrees
taxes
without
its
consent
cruelty
to
the
ascendency
of
priests
irresponsible
ministers
and
offensive
symbols
of
romanism
if
these
reforms
had
been
granted
and
such
a
sovereign
as
elizabeth
would
have
yielded
however
reluctantly
there
would
have
been
no
english
revolution
or
even
if
the
popular
leaders
had
been
more
patient
and
waited
for
their
time
and
been
willing
to
carry
out
these
reforms
constitutionally
there
would
have
been
no
revolution
but
neither
the
king
nor
parliament
would
yield
and
the
parliament
was
dissolved
the
next
parliament
was
not
only
angry
it
was
defiant
and
unscrupulous
it
resolved
on
revolution
and
determined
to
put
the
king
himself
aside
it
began
with
vigorous
measures
and
impeached
both
laud
and
strafford
doubtless
very
able
men
but
not
fitted
for
their
times
it
decreed
sweeping
changes
usurped
the
executive
authority
appealed
to
arms
and
made
war
on
the
government
the
king
also
on
his
part
appealed
to
the
sword
which
now
alone
could
settle
the
difficulties
the
contest
was
inevitable
the
nation
clamored
for
reform
the
king
would
not
grant
it
the
parliament
would
not
wait
to
secure
it
constitutionally
both
parties
were
angry
and
resolute
reason
departed
from
the
councils
of
the
nation
passion
now
ruled
and
civil
war
began
it
was
not
at
first
a
question
about
the
form
of
government
whether
a
king
or
an
elected
ruler
should
bear
sway
it
was
purely
a
question
of
reforms
in
the
existing
government
limiting
of
course
the
power
of
the
king
but
reforms
deemed
so
vital
to
the
welfare
of
the
nation
that
the
best
people
were
willing
to
shed
their
blood
to
secure
them
and
if
reason
and
moderation
could
have
borne
sway
that
angry
strife
might
have
been
averted
but
people
will
not
listen
to
reason
in
times
of
maddening
revolution
they
prefer
to
fight
and
run
their
chances
and
incur
the
penalty
and
when
contending
parties
appeal
to
the
sword
then
all
ordinary
rules
are
set
aside
and
success
belongs
to
the
stronger
and
the
victors
exact
what
they
please
the
rules
of
all
deadly
and
desperate
warfare
seem
to
recognize
this
the
fortune
of
war
put
the
king
into
the
hands
of
the
revolutionists
and
in
fear
more
than
in
vengeance
they
executed
him
just
what
he
would
have
done
to
leaders
if
had
won
said
falkland
hath
no
fellow
in
a
national
conflagration
we
lose
sight
of
laws
even
of
written
constitutions
great
necessities
compel
extraordinary
measures
not
such
as
are
sustained
either
by
reason
or
precedents
the
great
lesson
of
war
especially
of
civil
war
is
that
contending
parties
might
better
make
great
concessions
than
resort
to
it
for
it
is
certain
to
demoralize
a
nation
heated
partisans
hate
compromise
yet
war
itself
generally
ends
in
compromise
it
is
interesting
to
see
how
many
constitutions
how
many
institutions
in
both
church
and
state
are
based
on
compromise
now
it
was
amid
all
the
fierce
contentions
of
that
revolutionary
age
an
age
of
intense
earnestness
when
the
grandest
truths
were
agitated
an
age
of
experiment
of
bold
discussions
of
wild
fanaticisms
of
bitter
hatreds
of
unconquerable
prejudices
yet
of
great
loftiness
and
spiritual
power
that
the
star
of
oliver
cromwell
arose
he
was
born
in
the
year
of
a
good
family
he
was
a
country
squire
a
gentleman
farmer
though
not
much
given
to
or
dinner
hilarities
preferring
to
read
political
pamphlets
or
to
listen
to
long
sermons
or
to
hold
discussions
on
grace
predestination
and
foreknowledge
absolute
his
favorite
doctrine
was
the
second
coming
of
christ
and
the
reign
of
the
saints
the
elect
to
whom
of
course
he
belonged
he
had
visions
and
rhapsodies
and
believed
in
special
divine
illumination
cromwell
was
not
a
presbyterian
but
an
independent
and
the
independents
were
the
most
advanced
party
of
his
day
both
in
politics
and
religion
the
progressive
man
of
that
age
was
a
calvinist
in
all
the
grandeur
and
in
all
the
narrowness
of
that
unfashionable
and
misunderstood
creed
the
time
had
not
come
for
advanced
thinkers
to
repudiate
a
personal
god
and
supernatural
agencies
then
an
atheist
or
even
a
deist
and
indeed
a
materialist
of
the
school
of
democritus
and
lucretius
was
unknown
john
milton
was
one
of
the
representative
men
of
the
puritans
of
the
seventeenth
century
men
who
colonized
new
england
and
planted
the
germs
of
institutions
which
have
spread
to
the
rocky
mountains
cromwell
on
his
farm
one
of
the
landed
gentry
had
a
cambridge
education
and
was
early
an
influential
man
his
sagacity
his
intelligence
his
honesty
and
his
lofty
religious
life
marked
him
out
as
a
fit
person
to
represent
his
county
in
parliament
he
at
once
became
the
associate
of
such
men
as
hampden
and
pym
he
did
not
make
very
graceful
speeches
and
he
had
an
ungainly
person
but
he
was
eloquent
in
a
rude
way
since
he
had
strong
convictions
and
good
sense
he
was
probably
violent
for
he
hated
the
abuses
of
the
times
and
he
hated
rome
and
the
prelacy
he
represented
the
extreme
left
that
is
he
was
a
radical
and
preferred
revolution
to
tyranny
yet
even
he
would
probably
have
accepted
reform
if
reform
had
been
possible
without
violence
but
cromwell
had
no
faith
in
the
king
or
his
ministers
and
was
inclined
to
summary
measures
he
afterwards
showed
this
tendency
of
character
in
his
military
career
he
was
one
of
those
earnest
and
practical
people
who
could
not
be
fooled
with
so
he
became
a
leader
of
those
who
were
most
violent
against
the
government
during
the
long
parliament
cromwell
sat
for
cambridge
which
fact
shows
that
he
was
then
a
marked
man
far
from
being
unimportant
this
was
the
parliament
assembled
in
which
impeached
strafford
and
laud
which
abolished
the
star
chamber
and
inaugurated
the
civil
war
that
began
when
charles
left
whitehall
january
for
york
the
parliament
solicited
contributions
called
out
the
militia
and
appointed
to
the
command
of
the
forces
the
earl
of
essex
a
presbyterian
who
established
his
headquarters
at
northampton
while
charles
unfurled
the
royal
standard
at
nottingham
cromwell
was
when
he
buckled
on
his
sword
as
a
volunteer
he
subscribed
five
hundred
pounds
to
the
cause
of
liberty
raised
a
troop
of
horse
which
gradually
swelled
into
that
famous
regiment
of
one
thousand
men
called
ironsides
which
was
never
beaten
of
this
regiment
he
was
made
colonel
in
the
spring
of
he
had
distinguished
himself
at
edgehill
in
the
first
year
of
the
war
but
he
drew
upon
himself
the
eyes
of
the
nation
at
the
battle
of
marston
moor
july
gained
by
the
discipline
of
his
men
which
put
the
north
of
england
into
the
hands
of
parliament
he
was
then
second
in
command
to
the
earl
of
manchester
the
second
battle
of
newbury
though
a
success
gave
cromwell
then
one
of
the
most
influential
members
of
parliament
an
occasion
to
complain
of
the
imbecility
of
the
noblemen
who
controlled
the
army
and
who
were
presbyterians
the
ordinance
which
prohibited
members
of
parliament
from
command
in
the
army
was
a
blow
at
presbyterianism
and
aristocracy
and
marked
the
growing
power
of
the
independents
it
was
planned
by
cromwell
although
it
would
have
deprived
him
also
of
his
command
but
he
was
made
an
exception
to
the
rule
and
he
knew
he
would
be
since
his
party
could
not
spare
him
then
was
fought
the
battle
of
naseby
june
in
which
cromwell
commanded
the
right
wing
of
the
army
fairfax
nominally
his
superior
general
the
centre
and
ireton
the
left
against
prince
rupert
and
charles
the
battle
was
won
by
the
bravery
of
cromwell
and
decided
the
fortunes
of
the
king
although
he
was
still
able
to
keep
the
field
cromwell
now
became
the
foremost
man
in
england
for
two
years
he
resided
chiefly
in
london
taking
an
important
part
in
negotiations
with
the
king
and
in
the
contest
between
the
independents
and
presbyterians
the
former
of
which
represented
the
army
while
the
latter
still
had
the
ascendency
in
parliament
on
the
of
august
was
fought
the
battle
of
preston
in
which
cromwell
defeated
the
scotch
army
commanded
by
the
duke
of
hamilton
which
opened
edinburgh
to
his
victorious
troops
and
made
him
of
the
armies
of
the
commonwealth
the
presbyterians
at
least
of
scotland
it
would
seem
preferred
now
the
restoration
of
the
king
to
the
ascendency
of
cromwell
with
the
army
to
back
him
for
it
was
the
army
and
not
the
parliament
which
had
given
him
supreme
command
then
followed
the
rapid
conquest
of
the
scots
the
return
of
the
victorious
general
to
london
and
the
suppression
of
the
liberty
of
parliament
for
it
was
purged
of
its
presbyterian
leaders
the
ascendency
of
the
independents
began
for
though
in
a
minority
they
were
backed
by
an
army
which
obeyed
implicitly
the
commands
and
even
the
wishes
of
cromwell
the
great
tragedy
which
disgraced
the
revolution
was
now
acted
the
unfortunate
king
whose
fate
was
sealed
at
the
battle
of
naseby
after
various
vicissitudes
and
defeats
put
himself
into
the
hands
of
the
scots
and
made
a
league
with
the
presbyterians
after
edinburgh
was
taken
they
virtually
sold
him
to
the
victor
who
caused
him
to
be
brought
in
bitter
mockery
to
hampton
court
where
he
was
treated
with
ironical
respect
in
his
reverses
charles
would
have
made
concessions
and
the
presbyterians
who
first
took
up
arms
against
him
would
perhaps
have
accepted
them
but
it
was
too
late
cromwell
and
the
independents
now
reigned
a
party
that
had
been
driven
into
violent
measures
and
which
had
sought
the
subversion
of
the
monarchy
itself
charles
is
brought
to
a
mock
trial
by
a
decimated
parliament
is
condemned
and
executed
and
the
old
monarchy
is
supplanted
by
a
military
despotism
the
roaring
conflagration
of
anarchies
is
succeeded
by
the
rule
of
the
strongest
man
much
has
been
written
and
said
about
that
execution
or
martyrdom
or
crime
as
it
has
been
variously
viewed
by
partisans
it
simply
was
the
sequence
of
the
revolution
of
the
appeal
of
both
parties
to
the
sword
it
may
have
been
necessary
or
unnecessary
a
blunder
or
a
crime
but
it
was
the
logical
result
of
a
bitter
war
it
was
the
cruel
policy
of
a
conquering
power
those
who
supported
it
were
able
men
who
deemed
it
the
wisest
thing
to
do
who
dreaded
a
reaction
who
feared
for
themselves
and
sought
by
this
means
to
perpetuate
their
sway
as
one
of
the
acts
of
revolution
it
must
be
judged
by
the
revolution
itself
the
point
is
not
whether
it
was
wrong
to
take
the
life
of
the
king
if
it
were
a
military
necessity
or
seemed
to
be
to
the
great
leaders
of
the
day
but
whether
it
was
right
to
take
up
arms
in
defence
of
rights
which
might
have
been
gained
by
protracted
constitutional
agitation
and
resistance
the
execution
proved
a
blunder
because
it
did
not
take
away
the
rights
of
charles
and
created
great
abhorrence
and
indignation
not
merely
in
foreign
countries
but
among
a
majority
of
the
english
people
themselves
and
these
too
who
had
the
prestige
of
wealth
and
culture
i
do
not
believe
the
presbyterian
party
as
represented
by
hampden
and
pym
and
who
like
mirabeau
had
applied
the
torch
to
revolutionary
passions
would
have
consented
to
this
foolish
murder
certainly
the
episcopalians
would
not
have
executed
charles
even
if
they
could
have
been
induced
to
cripple
him
but
war
is
a
conflagration
nothing
can
stop
its
ravages
when
it
has
fairly
begun
they
who
go
to
war
must
abide
the
issue
of
war
they
who
take
the
sword
must
be
prepared
to
perish
by
the
sword
thus
far
in
the
history
of
the
world
very
few
rights
have
been
gained
by
civil
war
which
could
not
have
been
gained
in
the
end
without
it
the
great
rights
which
the
people
have
secured
in
england
for
two
hundred
years
are
the
result
of
an
appeal
to
reason
and
justice
the
second
revolution
was
bloodless
the
parliament
which
first
arrayed
itself
against
the
government
of
charles
was
no
mean
foe
even
if
it
had
not
resorted
to
arms
it
held
the
it
had
the
power
to
cripple
the
king
and
to
worry
him
into
concessions
but
if
the
king
was
resolved
to
attack
the
parliament
itself
and
coerce
it
by
a
standing
army
and
destroy
all
liberty
in
england
then
the
question
assumed
another
shape
the
war
then
became
defensive
and
was
plainly
justifiable
and
charles
could
but
accept
the
issue
even
his
own
execution
if
it
seemed
necessary
to
his
conquerors
they
took
up
arms
in
and
war
of
course
brought
to
light
the
energies
and
talents
of
the
greatest
general
who
as
victor
would
have
his
reward
cromwell
concluded
to
sweep
away
the
old
monarchy
and
reign
himself
instead
and
the
execution
of
the
king
was
one
of
his
war
measures
it
was
the
penalty
charles
paid
for
making
war
on
his
subjects
instead
of
ruling
them
according
to
the
laws
his
fate
was
hard
and
sad
we
feel
more
compassion
than
indignation
in
our
times
he
would
have
been
permitted
to
run
away
but
those
stern
and
angry
old
revolutionists
demanded
his
blood
for
this
cruel
or
necessary
act
cromwell
is
responsible
more
than
any
man
in
england
since
he
could
have
prevented
it
if
he
pleased
he
ruled
the
army
which
ruled
the
parliament
it
was
not
the
nation
or
the
representatives
of
the
nation
who
decreed
the
execution
of
charles
it
was
the
army
and
the
purged
parliament
composed
chiefly
of
independents
who
wanted
the
subversion
of
the
monarchy
itself
technically
charles
was
tried
by
the
parliament
or
the
judges
appointed
by
them
really
cromwell
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
affair
as
much
as
john
calvin
was
responsible
for
the
burning
of
servetus
let
partisans
say
what
they
please
there
never
has
a
great
crime
or
blunder
been
committed
on
this
earth
which
bigoted
or
narrow
or
zealous
partisans
have
not
attempted
to
justify
bigoted
catholics
have
justified
even
the
slaughter
of
bartholomew
partisans
have
no
law
but
expediency
all
jesuits
political
religious
and
social
in
the
catholic
and
protestant
churches
alike
seem
to
think
that
the
end
justifies
the
means
even
in
the
most
beneficent
reforms
and
when
pushed
to
the
wall
by
the
logic
of
opponents
will
fall
back
on
the
examples
of
the
old
testament
in
defence
of
lying
and
cheating
they
will
quote
abraham
at
the
court
of
pharaoh
there
is
no
insult
to
the
human
understanding
more
flagrant
than
the
doctrine
that
we
may
do
evil
that
good
may
come
and
yet
the
politics
and
reforms
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
seem
to
have
been
based
on
that
miserable
form
of
jesuitism
here
machiavelli
is
as
vulnerable
as
escobar
and
burleigh
as
well
as
oliver
cromwell
who
was
not
more
profound
in
dissimulation
than
queen
elizabeth
herself
the
best
excuse
we
can
render
for
the
political
and
religious
crimes
of
that
age
is
that
they
were
in
accordance
with
its
ideas
and
who
is
superior
to
the
ideas
of
his
age
on
the
execution
of
the
king
the
supreme
authority
was
nominally
in
the
hands
of
parliament
of
course
all
kinds
of
anarchies
prevailed
and
all
government
was
unsettled
charles
ii
was
proclaimed
king
by
the
scots
while
the
duke
of
ormond
in
ireland
joined
the
royal
party
to
seat
charles
ii
on
the
throne
in
this
exigency
cromwell
was
appointed
by
the
parliament
of
ireland
then
followed
the
conquest
of
ireland
in
which
cromwell
distinguished
himself
for
great
military
abilities
his
vigorous
and
uncompromising
measures
especially
his
slaughter
of
the
garrison
of
drogheda
a
retaliatory
act
have
been
severely
commented
on
but
war
in
the
hands
of
masters
is
never
carried
on
sentimentally
the
test
of
ability
is
success
the
measures
were
doubtless
hard
and
severe
but
cromwell
knew
what
he
was
about
he
wished
to
bring
the
war
to
a
speedy
close
and
intimidation
was
probably
the
best
course
to
pursue
those
impracticable
irish
never
afterwards
molested
him
in
less
than
a
year
he
was
at
leisure
to
oppose
charles
ii
in
scotland
and
on
the
resignation
of
fairfax
he
was
made
of
all
the
forces
in
the
empire
the
battle
of
dunbar
resulted
in
the
total
defeat
of
the
scots
while
the
crowning
mercy
at
worcester
utterly
blasted
the
hopes
of
charles
and
completely
annihilated
his
forces
the
civil
war
which
raged
nine
years
was
now
finished
and
cromwell
became
supreme
but
even
the
decimated
parliament
was
jealous
and
raised
an
issue
on
which
cromwell
dissolved
it
with
a
file
of
soldiers
and
assembled
another
neither
elective
nor
representative
composed
of
his
creatures
without
experience
chiefly
anabaptists
and
independents
which
he
soon
did
away
with
he
then
called
a
council
of
leading
men
who
made
him
lord
protector
december
even
the
shadow
of
constitutional
authority
now
vanishes
and
cromwell
rules
with
absolute
and
untrammelled
power
like
julius
caesar
or
napoleon
bonaparte
he
rules
on
the
very
principles
which
he
condemned
in
charles
i
the
revolution
ends
in
a
military
despotism
if
there
was
ever
a
usurpation
this
was
one
liberty
gave
her
last
sigh
on
the
remonstrance
of
sir
harry
vane
and
a
military
hero
by
means
of
his
army
stamps
his
iron
heel
on
england
he
dissolves
the
very
body
from
which
he
received
his
own
authority
he
refuses
to
have
any
check
on
his
will
he
imposes
taxes
without
the
consent
of
the
people
the
very
thing
for
which
he
took
up
arms
against
charles
he
reigns
alone
on
despotic
principles
as
absolute
as
louis
xiv
he
enshrouds
himself
in
royal
state
at
hampton
court
he
even
seeks
to
bequeath
his
absolute
power
to
his
son
and
if
richard
cromwell
had
reigned
like
his
father
oliver
then
the
cause
of
liberty
would
have
been
lost
all
this
is
cold
unvarnished
history
we
can
not
get
over
or
around
these
facts
they
blaze
out
to
the
eyes
of
all
readers
and
will
blaze
to
the
most
distant
ages
cromwell
began
as
a
reformer
but
ended
as
a
usurper
whatever
name
he
goes
by
whatever
title
he
may
have
assumed
he
became
by
force
of
his
victories
and
of
his
army
the
absolute
ruler
of
england
as
caesar
did
of
rome
and
napoleon
of
paris
we
may
palliate
or
extenuate
this
fact
we
may
even
excuse
it
on
the
ground
that
the
state
had
drifted
into
anarchy
that
only
he
as
the
stronger
man
could
save
england
that
there
was
no
other
course
open
to
him
as
a
patriot
and
that
it
was
a
most
fortunate
thing
for
england
that
he
seized
the
reins
and
became
a
tyrant
to
put
down
anarchies
but
whatever
were
the
excuses
by
which
cromwell
justified
himself
or
his
admirers
justify
him
let
us
not
deny
the
facts
it
may
have
been
necessary
under
his
circumstances
to
reign
alone
by
the
aid
of
his
standing
army
but
do
not
attempt
to
gloss
over
the
veritable
fact
that
he
did
reign
without
the
support
of
parliament
and
in
defiance
of
all
constitutional
authorities
it
was
not
the
nation
which
elevated
him
to
supreme
power
but
his
soldiers
at
no
time
would
any
legitimate
parliament
or
any
popular
voice
have
made
him
an
absolute
ruler
he
could
not
even
have
got
a
plebiscitum
as
louis
napoleon
did
he
was
not
liked
by
the
nation
at
large
not
even
by
the
more
enlightened
and
conservative
of
the
puritans
such
as
the
presbyterians
and
as
for
the
episcopalians
they
looked
upon
him
not
only
as
a
usurper
but
as
a
hypocrite
it
is
difficult
to
justify
such
an
act
as
usurpation
and
military
tyranny
by
the
standard
of
an
immutable
morality
if
the
overturning
of
all
constitutional
authority
by
a
man
who
professed
to
be
a
reformer
yet
who
reigned
illegally
as
a
despot
can
be
defended
it
is
only
on
the
principle
of
expediency
that
the
end
justifies
the
means
the
plea
of
the
jesuits
and
of
all
the
despots
who
have
overturned
constitutions
and
national
liberties
but
this
is
rank
and
undisguised
caesarism
the
question
then
arises
was
it
necessary
that
a
caesar
should
reign
at
hampton
court
some
people
think
it
was
and
all
admit
that
after
the
execution
of
the
king
there
was
no
settled
government
nothing
but
bitter
intolerant
factions
each
of
which
wished
its
own
ascendency
and
all
were
alike
unscrupulous
revolution
ever
creates
factions
and
angry
parties
more
or
less
violent
it
is
claimed
by
many
that
a
good
government
was
impossible
with
these
various
and
contending
parties
and
that
nothing
but
anarchy
would
have
existed
had
not
cromwell
seized
the
reins
and
sustained
himself
by
a
standing
army
and
ruled
despotically
again
others
think
that
he
was
urged
by
a
pressure
which
even
he
could
not
resist
that
of
the
army
that
he
was
controlled
by
circumstances
that
he
could
do
no
otherwise
unless
he
resigned
england
to
her
fate
to
the
anarchy
of
quarrelling
and
angry
parties
who
would
not
listen
to
reason
and
who
were
too
inexperienced
to
govern
in
such
stormy
times
the
episcopalians
certainly
and
the
presbyterians
probably
would
have
restored
charles
and
this
cromwell
regarded
as
a
great
possible
calamity
if
the
king
had
been
restored
all
the
fruit
of
the
revolution
would
have
been
lost
there
would
have
been
a
renewed
reign
of
frivolities
insincerities
court
scandals
venalities
favorites
and
disguised
romanism
yea
an
alliance
would
have
been
formed
with
the
old
tyrants
of
europe
cromwell
was
no
fool
and
he
had
a
great
insight
into
the
principles
on
which
the
stability
and
prosperity
of
a
nation
rested
he
doubtless
felt
that
the
nation
required
a
strong
arm
at
the
helm
and
that
no
one
could
save
england
in
such
a
storm
but
himself
i
believe
he
was
sincere
in
this
conviction
a
conviction
based
on
profound
knowledge
of
men
and
the
circumstances
of
the
age
i
believe
he
was
willing
to
be
aspersed
even
by
his
old
friends
and
heartily
cursed
by
his
enemies
if
he
could
guide
the
ship
of
state
into
a
safe
harbor
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
he
was
patriotic
in
his
intentions
that
he
wished
to
save
the
country
even
if
necessary
by
illegal
means
that
he
believed
there
was
a
higher
law
and
that
an
enlightened
posterity
would
vindicate
his
name
and
memory
he
was
not
deceived
as
to
his
abilities
even
if
he
were
as
to
his
call
he
knew
he
was
the
strongest
man
in
england
and
that
only
the
strongest
could
rule
he
was
willing
to
assume
the
responsibility
whatever
violence
he
should
do
to
his
early
principles
or
to
the
opinions
of
those
with
whom
he
was
at
first
associated
if
there
was
anything
that
marked
the
character
of
cromwell
it
was
the
abiding
sense
from
first
to
last
of
his
personal
responsibility
to
god
almighty
whose
servant
and
instrument
he
felt
himself
to
be
i
believe
he
was
loyal
to
his
conscience
if
not
to
his
cause
he
may
have
committed
grave
errors
for
he
was
not
infallible
it
may
have
been
an
error
that
he
ruled
virtually
without
a
parliament
since
it
was
better
that
a
good
measure
should
be
defeated
than
that
the
cause
of
liberty
should
be
trodden
under
foot
it
was
better
that
parliaments
should
wrangle
and
quarrel
than
that
there
should
be
no
representation
of
the
nation
at
all
and
it
was
an
undoubted
error
to
transmit
his
absolute
authority
to
his
son
for
this
was
establishing
a
new
dynasty
of
kings
one
of
the
worst
things
which
napoleon
ever
did
was
to
seat
his
brothers
on
the
old
thrones
of
europe
doubtless
cromwell
wished
to
perpetuate
the
policy
of
his
government
but
he
had
no
right
to
perpetuate
a
despotism
in
his
own
family
that
was
an
insult
to
the
nation
and
to
the
cause
of
constitutional
liberty
here
he
was
selfish
and
ambitious
for
great
as
he
was
he
was
not
greater
than
the
nation
or
his
cause
but
i
need
not
dwell
on
the
blunders
of
cromwell
if
we
call
them
by
no
harsher
name
it
would
be
harsh
to
judge
him
for
his
mistakes
or
sins
under
his
peculiar
circumstances
his
hand
in
the
execution
of
charles
his
jesuitical
principles
his
cruelties
in
ireland
his
dispersion
of
parliaments
and
his
usurpation
of
supreme
power
only
let
us
call
things
by
their
right
names
we
gain
nothing
by
glossing
over
defects
the
historians
of
the
bible
tell
us
how
abraham
told
lies
to
the
king
of
egypt
and
david
caused
uriah
to
be
slain
after
he
had
appropriated
his
wife
yet
who
were
greater
and
better
upon
the
whole
than
these
favorites
of
heaven
cromwell
earned
his
great
fame
as
one
of
the
wisest
statesmen
and
ablest
rulers
that
england
ever
had
like
all
monarchs
he
is
to
be
judged
by
the
services
he
rendered
to
civilization
he
was
not
a
faultless
man
but
he
proved
himself
a
great
benefactor
whether
we
like
him
or
not
we
are
compelled
to
admit
that
his
administration
was
able
and
beneficent
and
that
he
seemed
to
be
actuated
by
a
sincere
desire
to
do
all
the
good
he
could
if
he
was
ambitious
his
ambition
was
directed
to
the
prosperity
and
glory
of
his
country
if
he
levied
taxes
without
the
consent
of
the
nation
he
spent
the
money
economically
wisely
and
unselfishly
he
sought
no
inglorious
pomps
he
built
no
expensive
palaces
he
gave
no
foolish
fetes
nor
did
he
seek
to
disguise
his
tyranny
by
amusing
or
demoralizing
the
people
like
the
old
roman
caesars
he
would
even
have
established
a
constitutional
monarchy
had
it
been
practicable
the
plots
of
royalists
tempted
him
to
appoint
to
responsible
situations
to
protect
his
life
he
resorted
to
guards
he
could
not
part
with
his
power
but
he
used
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
nation
if
he
did
not
reign
by
or
through
the
people
he
reigned
the
people
he
established
religious
liberty
and
tolerated
all
sects
but
catholics
and
quakers
the
presbyterians
were
his
enemies
but
he
never
persecuted
them
he
had
a
great
regard
for
law
and
appointed
the
ablest
and
best
men
to
high
judicial
positions
sir
matthew
hale
whom
he
made
was
the
greatest
lawyer
in
england
an
ornament
to
any
country
cromwell
made
strenuous
efforts
to
correct
the
abuses
of
the
court
of
chancery
and
of
criminal
law
he
established
trial
by
jury
for
political
offences
he
tried
to
procure
the
formal
of
the
jews
to
england
he
held
conferences
with
george
fox
he
snatched
biddle
the
socinian
from
the
fangs
of
persecutors
he
fostered
commerce
and
developed
the
industrial
resources
of
the
nation
like
burleigh
and
colbert
he
created
a
navy
and
became
the
father
of
the
maritime
greatness
of
england
he
suppressed
all
license
among
the
soldiers
although
his
power
rested
on
their
loyalty
to
him
he
honored
learning
and
exalted
the
universities
placing
in
them
learned
men
he
secured
the
union
between
england
and
scotland
and
called
representatives
from
scotland
to
his
parliaments
he
adopted
a
generous
policy
with
the
colonies
in
north
america
and
freed
them
from
rapacious
governors
his
war
policy
was
not
for
mere
aggrandizement
he
succeeded
gustavus
adolphus
as
the
protector
of
protestantism
on
the
continent
he
sought
to
make
england
respected
among
all
the
nations
and
as
righteousness
exalts
a
nation
he
sought
to
maintain
public
morality
his
court
was
simple
and
decorous
he
gave
no
countenance
to
levities
and
follies
and
his
own
private
life
was
pure
and
religious
so
that
there
was
general
admiration
of
his
conduct
as
well
as
of
his
government
cromwell
was
certainly
very
fortunate
in
his
régime
the
army
and
navy
did
wonders
blake
and
monk
gained
great
victories
gibraltar
was
taken
one
of
the
richest
prizes
that
england
ever
gained
in
war
the
fleets
of
spain
were
destroyed
the
trade
of
the
indies
was
opened
to
his
ships
he
maintained
the
balance
of
power
he
punished
the
african
pirates
of
the
mediterranean
his
glory
reached
asia
and
extended
to
america
so
great
was
his
renown
that
the
descendants
of
abraham
even
on
the
distant
plains
of
asia
inquired
of
one
another
if
he
were
not
the
servant
of
the
king
of
kings
whom
they
were
looking
for
a
learned
rabbi
even
came
from
asia
to
london
for
the
purpose
of
investigating
his
pedigree
thinking
to
discover
in
him
the
lion
of
the
tribe
of
judah
if
his
policy
had
been
followed
out
by
his
successors
louis
xiv
would
not
have
dared
to
revoke
the
edict
of
nantes
if
he
had
reigned
ten
years
longer
there
would
have
been
no
revival
of
romanism
i
suppose
england
never
had
so
enlightened
a
monarch
he
was
more
like
charlemagne
than
richelieu
contrast
him
with
louis
a
contemporaneous
despot
cromwell
devoted
all
his
energies
to
develop
the
resources
of
his
country
while
louis
did
what
he
could
to
waste
them
cromwell
reign
was
favorable
to
the
development
of
individual
genius
but
louis
was
such
an
intolerable
egotist
that
at
the
close
of
his
reign
all
the
great
lights
had
disappeared
cromwell
was
tolerant
louis
was
persecuting
cromwell
laid
the
foundation
of
an
indefinite
expansion
louis
sowed
the
seeds
of
discontent
and
revolution
both
indeed
took
the
sword
the
one
to
dethrone
the
stuarts
the
other
to
exterminate
the
protestants
cromwell
bequeathed
to
successors
the
moral
force
of
personal
virtue
louis
paved
the
way
for
the
most
disgraceful
excesses
cromwell
spent
his
leisure
hours
with
his
family
and
with
divines
louis
with
his
favorites
and
mistresses
cromwell
would
listen
to
expostulations
louis
crushed
all
who
differed
from
him
the
career
of
the
former
was
a
progressive
rise
that
of
the
latter
a
progressive
fall
the
ultimate
influence
of
cromwell
policy
was
to
develop
the
greatness
of
england
that
of
louis
to
cut
the
sinews
of
national
wealth
and
poison
those
sources
of
renovation
which
still
remained
the
memory
of
cromwell
is
dear
to
good
men
in
spite
of
his
defects
while
that
of
louis
in
spite
of
his
graces
and
urbanities
is
a
watchword
for
all
that
is
repulsive
in
despotism
hence
cromwell
is
more
and
more
a
favorite
with
enlightened
minds
while
louis
is
more
and
more
regarded
as
a
man
who
made
the
welfare
of
the
state
subordinate
to
his
own
glory
in
a
word
cromwell
feared
only
god
while
louis
feared
only
hell
the
piety
of
the
one
was
lofty
that
of
the
other
was
technical
formal
and
pharisaical
the
chief
defect
in
the
character
of
cromwell
was
his
expediency
or
what
i
call
following
out
good
ends
by
questionable
means
the
chief
defect
in
the
character
of
louis
was
an
absorbing
egotism
which
sacrificed
everything
for
private
pleasure
or
interest
the
difficulty
in
judging
cromwell
seems
to
me
to
be
in
the
imperfection
of
our
standards
of
public
morality
we
are
apt
to
excuse
in
a
ruler
what
we
condemn
in
a
private
man
if
oliver
cromwell
is
to
be
measured
by
the
standard
which
accepts
expediency
as
a
guide
in
life
he
will
be
excused
for
his
worst
acts
if
he
is
to
be
measured
by
an
immutable
standard
he
will
be
picked
to
pieces
in
regard
to
his
private
life
aside
from
cant
and
dissimulation
there
is
not
much
to
condemn
and
there
is
much
to
praise
he
was
not
a
libertine
like
henry
nor
an
egotist
like
napoleon
he
delighted
in
the
society
of
the
learned
and
the
pious
he
was
susceptible
to
grand
sentiments
he
was
just
in
his
dealings
and
fervent
in
his
devotions
he
was
liberal
humane
simple
unostentatious
and
economical
he
was
indeed
ambitious
but
his
ambition
was
noble
his
intellectual
defect
was
his
idea
of
special
divine
illumination
which
made
him
visionary
and
rhapsodical
and
conceited
he
was
a
and
believed
that
christ
would
return
at
no
distant
time
to
establish
the
reign
of
the
saints
upon
the
earth
but
his
morals
were
as
irreproachable
as
those
of
marcus
aurelius
like
michael
angelo
he
despised
frivolities
though
it
is
said
he
relished
rough
jokes
like
abraham
lincoln
he
was
conscientious
in
the
discharge
of
what
he
regarded
as
duties
and
seemed
to
feel
his
responsibility
to
god
as
the
sovereign
of
the
universe
his
family
revered
him
as
much
as
the
nation
respected
him
he
was
not
indeed
lovable
like
saint
louis
but
he
can
never
lose
the
admiration
of
mankind
since
the
glory
of
his
administration
was
not
sullied
by
those
private
vices
which
destroy
esteem
and
ultimately
undermine
both
power
and
influence
he
was
one
of
those
of
whom
nations
will
be
proud
as
they
advance
in
the
toleration
of
human
infirmities
as
they
draw
distinction
between
those
who
live
for
themselves
and
those
who
live
for
their
country
and
the
recognition
of
those
principles
on
which
all
progress
is
based
cromwell
died
prematurely
if
not
for
his
fame
at
least
for
his
usefulness
his
reign
as
protector
lasted
only
five
years
yet
what
wonders
he
did
in
that
brief
period
he
suppressed
the
anarchies
of
the
revolution
he
revived
law
he
restored
learning
he
developed
the
resources
of
his
country
he
made
it
respected
at
home
and
abroad
and
shed
an
imperishable
glory
on
his
administration
but
on
the
threshold
of
success
he
met
the
inexorable
enemy
it
was
a
stormy
night
august
when
the
wild
winds
were
roaring
and
all
nature
was
overclouded
with
darkness
and
gloom
that
the
last
intelligible
words
of
the
dying
hero
were
heard
by
his
attendants
o
lord
though
i
am
a
miserable
sinner
i
am
still
in
covenant
with
thee
thou
hast
made
me
though
very
unworthy
an
instrument
to
do
thy
people
good
and
go
on
o
lord
to
deliver
them
and
make
thy
name
glorious
throughout
the
world
these
dying
words
are
the
key
alike
to
his
character
and
his
mission
he
believed
himself
to
be
an
instrument
of
the
almighty
sovereign
in
whom
he
believed
and
whom
with
all
his
faults
and
errors
he
sought
to
serve
and
in
whom
he
trusted
and
it
is
in
this
light
chiefly
that
the
career
of
this
remarkable
man
is
to
be
viewed
an
instrument
of
god
he
plainly
was
to
avenge
the
wrongs
of
an
insulted
an
indignant
and
an
honest
nation
and
to
impress
upon
the
world
the
necessity
of
wise
and
benignant
rulers
he
arose
to
vindicate
the
majesty
of
public
virtue
to
rebuke
the
egotism
of
selfish
kings
to
punish
the
traitors
of
important
trusts
he
arose
to
point
out
the
true
sources
of
national
prosperity
to
head
off
the
troops
of
a
renovated
romanism
to
promote
liberty
of
conscience
in
all
matters
of
religious
belief
he
was
raised
up
as
a
champion
of
protestantism
when
kings
were
returning
to
rome
and
as
an
awful
chastiser
of
those
bigoted
and
quarrelsome
irish
who
have
ever
been
hostile
to
law
and
order
and
uncontrollable
by
any
influence
but
that
of
fear
but
above
all
he
was
raised
up
to
try
the
experiment
of
liberty
in
the
seventeenth
century
that
experiment
unfortunately
failed
all
sects
and
parties
sought
ascendency
rather
than
the
public
good
angry
and
inexperienced
they
refused
to
compromise
sectarianism
was
the
true
hydra
that
baffled
the
energy
of
the
courageous
combatant
parliaments
were
factious
meddlesome
and
inexperienced
and
sought
to
block
the
wheels
of
government
rather
than
promote
wholesome
legislation
the
people
hankered
for
their
old
pleasures
and
were
impatient
of
restraint
their
leaders
were
demagogues
or
fanatics
they
could
not
be
coerced
by
mild
measures
or
appeals
to
enlightened
reason
hence
coercive
measures
were
imperative
and
these
could
be
carried
only
by
a
large
standing
army
ever
the
terror
and
menace
of
liberty
the
greatest
blot
on
constitutional
governments
a
necessity
but
an
evil
since
the
military
power
should
be
subordinate
to
the
civil
not
the
civil
to
the
military
the
iron
hand
by
which
cromwell
was
obliged
to
rule
if
he
ruled
at
all
at
last
became
odious
to
all
classes
since
they
had
many
rights
which
were
ignored
when
they
clamored
for
the
blood
of
an
anointed
tyrant
they
did
not
bargain
for
a
renewed
despotism
more
irksome
and
burdensome
than
the
one
they
had
suppressed
the
public
rejoicings
the
universal
enthusiasm
the
brilliant
spectacles
and
fêtes
the
flattering
receptions
and
speeches
which
hailed
the
restoration
of
charles
showed
unmistakably
that
the
régime
of
cromwell
though
needed
for
a
time
was
unpopular
and
was
not
in
accordance
with
the
national
aspirations
if
they
were
to
be
ruled
by
a
tyrant
they
preferred
to
be
ruled
according
to
precedents
and
traditions
and
hallowed
associations
the
english
people
loved
then
as
they
love
now
as
they
ever
have
loved
royalty
the
reign
of
kings
according
to
the
principles
of
legitimacy
they
have
shown
the
disposition
to
fetter
these
kings
not
to
dispense
with
them
so
the
experiment
of
cromwell
and
his
party
failed
how
mournful
it
must
have
seemed
to
the
original
patriots
of
the
revolution
that
hard
iron
military
rule
was
all
that
england
had
gained
by
the
struggles
and
the
blood
of
her
best
people
wherefore
had
treasures
been
lavished
in
a
nine
years
contest
wherefore
the
battles
of
marston
moor
and
worcester
wherefore
the
eloquence
of
pym
and
hampden
all
wasted
the
house
which
had
been
swept
and
garnished
was
by
devils
worse
than
before
thus
did
this
experiment
seem
teaching
at
least
this
useful
and
impressive
lesson
that
despotism
will
succeed
unwise
and
violent
efforts
for
reform
that
reforms
are
not
to
be
carried
on
by
bayonets
but
by
reason
that
reformers
must
be
patient
and
must
be
contented
with
constitutional
measures
that
any
violation
of
the
immutable
laws
of
justice
will
be
visited
with
retribution
but
sad
as
this
experiment
seemed
can
it
be
pronounced
to
be
wholly
a
failure
no
earnest
human
experiment
is
ever
thrown
away
the
great
ideas
of
cromwell
and
of
those
who
originally
took
up
arms
with
him
entered
into
new
combinations
the
spirit
remained
if
the
form
was
changed
after
a
temporary
reaction
the
love
of
liberty
returned
the
second
revolution
of
was
the
logical
sequence
of
the
first
it
was
only
another
act
in
the
great
drama
of
national
development
the
spirit
which
overthrew
charles
also
overturned
the
throne
of
james
ii
but
the
wisdom
gained
by
experience
sent
him
into
exile
instead
of
executing
him
on
the
scaffold
two
experiments
with
those
treacherous
stuarts
were
necessary
before
the
conviction
became
fastened
on
the
mind
of
the
english
people
that
constitutional
liberty
could
not
exist
while
they
remained
upon
the
throne
and
the
spirit
which
had
burst
out
into
a
blazing
flame
two
generations
earlier
was
now
confined
within
constitutional
limits
but
it
was
not
suppressed
it
produced
salutary
reforms
with
every
advancing
generation
it
produced
says
macaulay
the
famous
declaration
of
right
which
guaranteed
the
liberties
of
the
english
upon
their
present
basis
which
again
led
to
the
freedom
of
the
press
the
abolition
of
slavery
catholic
emancipation
and
representative
reform
had
the
experiment
not
been
tried
by
cromwell
and
his
party
it
might
have
been
tried
by
worse
men
whose
gospel
of
rights
would
be
found
in
the
social
contract
of
a
rousseau
rather
than
in
the
catechism
of
the
westminster
divines
it
was
fortunate
that
revolutionary
passions
should
have
raged
in
the
bosoms
of
christians
rather
than
of
infidels
of
men
who
believed
in
obedience
to
a
personal
god
rather
than
men
who
teach
the
holiness
of
untutored
impulse
the
infallibility
of
majorities
and
the
majesty
of
the
unaided
intellect
of
man
and
then
who
can
estimate
the
value
of
cromwell
experience
on
the
patriots
of
our
own
revolution
his
example
may
even
have
taught
the
great
washington
how
dangerous
and
inconsistent
it
would
be
to
accept
an
earthly
crown
while
denouncing
the
tyranny
of
kings
and
how
much
more
enduring
is
that
fame
which
is
cherished
in
a
nation
heart
than
that
which
is
blared
by
the
trumpet
of
idolatrous
soldiers
indifferent

louis
xiv
the
french
monarchy
the
verdict
of
this
age
in
reference
to
louis
xiv
is
very
different
from
that
which
his
own
age
pronounced
two
hundred
years
ago
his
countrymen
called
him
grand
and
his
glory
filled
the
world
since
charlemagne
no
monarch
had
been
the
object
of
such
unbounded
panegyric
as
he
until
napoleon
appeared
he
lived
in
an
atmosphere
of
perpetual
incense
and
reigned
in
dazzling
magnificence
although
he
is
not
now
regarded
in
the
same
light
as
he
was
in
the
seventeenth
century
and
originated
no
great
movement
that
civilization
values
in
fact
was
anything
but
a
permanent
benefactor
to
his
country
or
mankind
yet
louis
xiv
is
still
one
of
the
beacon
lights
of
history
for
warning
if
not
for
guidance
his
reign
was
an
epoch
it
was
not
only
one
of
the
longest
in
human
annals
but
also
one
of
the
most
brilliant
imposing
and
interesting
whatever
opinion
may
exist
as
to
his
inherent
intellectual
greatness
no
candid
historian
denies
the
power
of
his
will
the
force
of
his
character
and
the
immense
influence
he
exerted
he
was
illustrious
if
he
was
not
great
he
was
powerful
if
he
made
fatal
mistakes
he
was
feared
and
envied
by
all
nations
even
when
he
stood
alone
and
it
took
all
europe
combined
to
strip
him
of
the
conquests
which
his
generals
made
and
to
preserve
the
balance
of
power
which
he
had
disturbed
with
all
europe
in
arms
against
him
he
an
old
and
man
contrived
to
preserve
by
his
fortitude
and
will
the
territories
he
had
inherited
and
he
died
peacefully
upon
his
bed
at
the
age
of
still
the
most
absolute
king
that
ever
reigned
in
france
a
man
so
strong
so
fortunate
until
his
latter
years
so
magnificent
in
his
court
which
he
made
the
most
brilliant
of
modern
times
so
lauded
by
the
great
geniuses
who
surrounded
his
throne
all
of
whom
looked
up
to
him
as
a
central
sun
of
power
and
glory
is
not
to
be
flippantly
judged
or
ruthlessly
hurled
from
that
proud
pinnacle
on
which
he
was
seated
amid
the
acclamations
of
two
generations
his
successes
dazzled
the
world
his
misfortunes
excited
its
pity
except
among
those
who
were
sufferers
by
his
needless
wars
or
his
cruel
persecutions
his
virtues
and
his
defects
both
stand
out
in
bold
relief
and
will
make
him
a
character
to
meditate
upon
as
long
as
history
shall
be
written
the
reign
of
louis
xiv
would
be
remarkable
for
the
great
men
who
shed
lustre
on
his
throne
if
he
had
himself
been
contemptible
voltaire
doubted
if
any
age
ever
saw
such
an
illustrious
group
and
he
compares
it
with
the
age
of
pericles
in
greece
with
that
of
augustus
in
rome
and
that
of
the
medici
in
italy
four
great
epochs
in
intellectual
excellence
which
have
never
been
surpassed
in
brilliancy
and
variety
of
talent
no
such
generals
had
arisen
since
the
palmy
days
of
roman
grandeur
as
condé
turenne
luxembourg
vauban
berwick
and
villars
if
we
except
gustavus
adolphus
and
those
generals
with
whom
the
marshals
of
louis
contended
such
as
william
marlborough
and
eugene
no
monarch
was
ever
served
by
abler
ministers
than
colbert
and
louvois
the
former
developing
the
industries
and
resources
of
a
great
country
and
the
latter
organizing
its
forces
for
all
the
exigencies
of
vast
military
campaigns
what
galaxy
of
poets
more
brilliant
than
that
which
shed
glory
on
the
throne
of
this
great
king
men
like
corneille
boileau
fontanelle
la
fontaine
racine
and
molière
no
one
of
them
a
dante
or
a
shakspeare
but
all
together
shining
as
a
constellation
what
great
jurists
and
lawyers
were
le
tellier
and
and
molé
what
great
prelates
and
preachers
were
bossuet
fénelon
bourdaloue
massillon
fléchier
saurin
unrivalled
for
eloquence
in
any
age
what
original
and
profound
thinkers
were
pascal
descartes
helvetius
malebranche
nicole
and
quesnel
until
the
seventeenth
century
what
more
respectable
historians
had
arisen
than
dupin
tillemont
mabillon
and
fleury
or
critics
and
scholars
than
bayle
arnauld
de
sacy
and
calmet
la
rochefoucauld
uttered
maxims
which
were
learned
by
heart
by
giddy
courtiers
great
painters
and
sculptors
such
as
le
brun
poussin
claude
lorrain
and
girardon
ornamented
the
palaces
which
mansard
erected
while
le
nôtre
laid
out
the
gardens
of
those
palaces
which
are
still
a
wonder
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
louis
xiv
had
an
intuitive
perception
of
genius
and
talent
which
he
was
proud
to
reward
and
anxious
to
appropriate
although
his
own
education
had
been
neglected
he
had
a
severe
taste
and
a
disgust
of
all
vulgarity
so
that
his
manners
were
decorous
and
dignified
in
the
midst
of
demoralizing
pleasures
proud
both
from
adulation
and
native
disposition
he
yet
was
polite
and
affable
he
never
passed
a
woman
without
lifting
his
hat
and
he
uniformly
rose
when
a
lady
entered
into
his
presence
but
with
all
his
politeness
he
never
unbent
even
in
the
society
of
his
most
intimate
friends
so
jealous
was
he
of
his
dignity
and
power
unscrupulous
in
his
public
transactions
and
immoral
in
his
private
relations
with
women
he
had
a
great
respect
for
the
ordinances
of
religion
and
was
punctilious
in
the
outward
observances
of
the
catholic
church
the
age
itself
was
religious
and
so
was
he
in
a
technical
and
pharisaical
piety
and
petty
ritualistic
duties
he
was
a
bigot
and
a
persecutor
which
fact
endeared
him
to
the
jesuits
by
whom
in
matters
of
conscience
he
was
ruled
so
that
he
became
their
tool
even
while
he
thought
he
controlled
everything
he
was
as
jealous
of
his
power
as
he
was
of
his
dignity
and
he
learned
to
govern
himself
as
well
as
his
subjects
he
would
himself
submit
to
the
most
rigid
formalities
in
order
to
exact
a
rigorous
discipline
and
secure
unconditional
obedience
from
others
no
one
ever
dared
openly
to
thwart
his
will
or
oppose
his
wishes
although
he
could
be
led
through
his
passions
and
his
vanity
he
was
imperious
in
his
commands
and
exacting
in
the
services
he
demanded
from
all
who
surrounded
his
person
he
had
perfect
health
a
strong
physique
great
aptitude
for
business
and
great
regularity
in
his
habits
it
was
difficult
to
deceive
him
for
he
understood
human
nature
and
thus
was
able
to
select
men
of
merit
and
talent
for
all
high
offices
in
state
and
church
in
one
sense
louis
xiv
seems
to
have
been
even
patriotic
since
he
identified
his
own
glory
with
that
of
the
nation
having
learned
something
from
richelieu
whose
policy
he
followed
hence
he
was
supported
by
the
people
if
he
was
not
loved
because
he
was
ambitious
of
making
france
the
most
powerful
nation
in
christendom
the
love
of
glory
ever
has
been
one
of
the
characteristics
of
the
french
nation
and
this
passion
the
king
impersonated
which
made
him
dear
to
the
nation
as
napoleon
was
before
he
became
intoxicated
by
power
and
hence
louis
had
the
power
of
rallying
his
subjects
in
great
misfortunes
they
forgave
extravagance
in
from
admiration
of
magnificence
they
were
proud
of
a
despot
who
called
out
the
praises
of
the
world
they
saw
in
his
parks
his
gardens
his
marble
halls
his
tapestries
his
pictures
and
his
statues
a
glory
which
belonged
to
france
as
well
as
to
him
they
marched
joyfully
in
his
armies
whatever
their
sacrifices
for
he
was
only
leading
them
to
glory
an
empty
illusion
yet
one
of
those
words
which
has
ruled
the
world
since
it
is
an
expression
of
that
vanity
which
has
its
roots
in
the
deepest
recesses
of
the
soul
glory
is
the
highest
aspiration
of
egotism
and
louis
was
an
incarnation
of
egotism
like
napoleon
after
him
they
both
represented
the
master
passions
of
the
people
to
whom
they
appealed
never
says
simon
has
any
one
governed
with
a
better
grace
or
by
the
manner
of
bestowing
more
enhanced
the
value
of
his
favors
never
has
any
one
sold
at
so
high
a
price
his
words
nay
his
very
smiles
and
glances
and
then
so
imposing
and
majestic
was
his
air
that
those
who
addressed
him
must
first
accustom
themselves
to
his
appearance
not
to
be
overawed
no
one
ever
knew
better
how
to
maintain
a
certain
manner
which
made
him
appear
great
yet
it
is
said
that
his
stature
was
small
no
one
knew
better
than
he
how
to
impress
upon
his
courtiers
the
idea
that
kings
are
of
a
different
blood
from
other
men
he
even
knew
how
to
invest
vice
and
immorality
with
an
air
of
elegance
and
was
capable
of
generous
sentiments
and
actions
he
on
one
occasion
sold
a
gold
service
of
plate
for
four
hundred
thousand
francs
to
purchase
bread
for
starving
troops
if
haughty
exacting
punctilious
he
was
not
cold
even
his
rigid
etiquette
and
dignified
reserve
were
the
dictates
of
statecraft
as
well
as
of
natural
inclination
he
seemed
to
feel
that
he
was
playing
a
great
part
with
the
eyes
of
the
world
upon
him
so
that
he
was
an
actor
as
napoleon
was
but
a
more
consistent
one
because
in
his
egotism
he
never
forgot
himself
not
even
among
his
mistresses
as
the
arbiter
of
all
fortunes
the
central
sun
of
all
glory
was
he
always
figuring
before
the
eyes
of
men
he
never
relaxed
his
habits
of
ceremony
and
ostentation
nor
his
vigilance
as
an
administrator
nor
his
iron
will
nor
his
thirst
for
power
so
that
he
ruled
as
he
wished
until
he
died
in
spite
of
the
reverses
of
his
sad
old
age
and
without
losing
the
respect
of
his
subjects
oppressed
as
they
were
with
taxes
and
humiliated
by
national
disasters
such
were
some
of
the
traits
which
made
louis
xiv
a
great
sovereign
if
not
a
great
man
he
was
not
only
supported
by
the
people
who
were
dazzled
by
his
magnificence
and
by
the
great
men
who
adorned
his
court
but
he
was
aided
by
fortunate
circumstances
and
great
national
ideas
he
was
heir
of
the
powers
of
richelieu
and
the
treasures
of
mazarin
those
two
cardinals
who
claimed
equal
rank
with
independent
princes
higher
than
that
of
the
old
nobility
pursued
essentially
the
same
policy
although
this
policy
was
the
fruit
of
richelieu
genius
and
this
policy
was
the
concentration
of
all
authority
in
the
hands
of
the
king
louis
xiii
was
the
feeblest
of
the
bourbons
but
he
made
his
throne
the
first
in
europe
richelieu
was
a
great
benefactor
to
the
cause
of
law
order
and
industry
despotic
as
was
his
policy
and
hateful
his
character
when
he
died
worn
out
by
his
herculean
labors
the
nobles
tried
to
regain
the
privileges
and
powers
they
had
lost
and
a
miserable
warfare
called
the
fronde
was
the
result
carried
on
without
genius
or
system
but
the
fronde
produced
some
heroes
who
were
destined
to
be
famous
in
the
great
wars
of
louis
xiv
mazarin
with
less
ability
than
richelieu
and
more
selfish
conquered
in
the
end
by
following
out
the
policy
of
his
predecessor
he
developed
the
resources
of
the
kingdom
besides
accumulating
an
enormous
fortune
for
himself
about
two
hundred
millions
of
francs
which
when
he
died
he
bequeathed
not
to
the
church
or
his
relatives
but
to
the
young
king
who
thus
became
personally
rich
as
well
as
strong
to
have
entered
upon
the
magnificent
inheritance
which
these
two
able
cardinals
bequeathed
to
the
monarchy
was
most
fortunate
to
louis
unrestricted
power
and
enormous
wealth
but
louis
was
still
more
fortunate
in
reaping
the
benefits
of
the
principle
of
royalty
we
have
in
the
united
states
but
a
feeble
conception
of
the
power
of
this
principle
in
europe
in
the
seventeenth
century
it
was
nursed
by
all
the
chivalric
sentiments
of
the
middle
ages
the
person
of
a
king
was
sacred
he
was
regarded
as
divinely
commissioned
the
sacred
oil
poured
on
his
head
by
the
highest
dignitary
of
the
church
at
his
coronation
imparted
to
him
a
sacred
charm
all
the
influences
of
the
church
as
well
as
those
of
feudalism
set
the
king
apart
from
all
other
men
as
a
consecrated
monarch
to
rule
the
people
this
loyalty
to
the
throne
had
the
sanction
of
the
jewish
nation
and
of
all
oriental
nations
from
the
remotest
ages
hence
the
world
has
known
no
other
form
of
government
than
that
of
kings
and
emperors
except
in
a
few
countries
and
for
a
brief
period
whatever
the
king
decreed
had
the
force
of
irresistible
law
no
one
dared
to
disobey
a
royal
mandate
but
a
rebel
in
actual
hostilities
resistance
to
royal
authority
was
ruin
this
royal
power
was
based
on
and
enforced
by
the
ideas
of
ages
who
can
resist
universally
accepted
ideas
moreover
in
france
especially
there
was
a
chivalric
charm
about
the
person
of
a
king
he
was
not
only
sacred
of
purer
blood
than
other
people
but
the
greatest
nobles
were
proud
to
attend
and
wait
upon
his
person
devotion
to
the
person
of
the
prince
became
the
highest
duty
it
was
not
political
slavery
but
a
religious
and
sentimental
allegiance
so
sacred
was
this
allegiance
that
only
the
most
detested
tyrants
were
in
personal
danger
of
assassination
or
those
who
were
objects
of
religious
fanaticism
a
king
could
dismiss
his
most
powerful
minister
or
his
most
triumphant
general
at
the
head
of
an
army
by
a
stroke
of
the
pen
or
by
a
word
without
expostulation
or
resistance
to
disobey
the
king
was
tantamount
to
defiance
of
almighty
power
a
great
general
rules
by
machinery
rather
than
devotion
to
his
person
but
devotion
to
the
king
needed
no
support
from
armies
or
guards
a
king
in
the
seventeenth
century
was
supposed
to
be
the
vicegerent
of
the
deity
another
still
more
powerful
influence
gave
stability
to
the
throne
of
louis
this
was
the
catholic
church
louis
was
a
devout
catholic
in
spite
of
his
sins
and
was
true
to
the
interests
of
the
pope
he
was
governed
so
far
as
he
was
governed
at
all
by
jesuit
confessors
he
associated
on
the
most
intimate
terms
with
the
great
prelates
and
churchmen
of
the
day
like
bossuet
fénelon
la
chaise
and
le
tellier
he
was
regular
at
church
and
admired
good
sermons
he
was
punctilious
in
all
the
outward
observances
of
his
religion
he
detested
all
rebellion
from
the
spiritual
authority
of
the
popes
he
hated
both
heresy
and
schism
in
his
devotion
to
the
catholic
church
he
was
as
narrow
and
intolerant
as
a
village
priest
his
sincerity
in
defence
of
the
church
was
never
questioned
and
hence
all
the
influences
of
the
church
were
exerted
to
uphold
his
domination
he
may
have
quarrelled
with
popes
on
political
grounds
and
humiliated
them
as
temporal
powers
but
he
stood
by
them
in
the
exercise
of
their
spiritual
functions
in
louis
reign
the
state
and
church
were
firmly
knit
together
it
was
deemed
necessary
to
be
a
good
catholic
in
order
to
be
even
a
citizen
so
that
religion
became
fashionable
provided
it
was
after
the
pattern
of
that
of
the
king
and
court
even
worldly
courtiers
entered
with
interest
into
the
most
subtile
of
theological
controversies
but
the
king
always
took
the
side
devoted
to
the
pope
and
he
hated
jansenism
almost
as
much
as
he
hated
protestantism
hence
the
catholic
church
ever
rallied
to
his
support
so
with
all
these
powerful
supports
louis
began
his
long
reign
of
years
which
technically
began
when
he
was
four
years
old
on
the
death
of
his
father
louis
in
when
the
kingdom
was
governed
by
his
mother
anne
of
austria
as
regent
and
by
cardinal
mazarin
as
prime
minister
during
the
minority
of
the
king
the
humiliation
of
the
nobles
continued
protestantism
was
only
tolerated
and
the
country
distracted
rather
than
impoverished
by
the
civil
war
of
the
fronde
with
its
intrigues
and
parties
a
giddy
maze
which
nobody
now
cares
to
unravel
a
sort
of
dance
of
death
in
which
figured
cardinals
princes
nobles
bishops
judges
and
generals
when
bacchus
momus
and
moloch
alternately
usurped
dominion
those
eighteen
years
of
strife
folly
absurdity
and
changing
fortunes
when
mazarin
was
twice
compelled
to
quit
the
kingdom
he
governed
when
the
was
forced
also
twice
to
fly
from
her
capital
when
cardinal
de
retz
disgraced
his
exalted
post
as
archbishop
of
paris
by
the
vilest
intrigues
when
condé
and
conti
obscured
the
lustre
of
their
military
laurels
when
alternately
the
parliaments
made
war
on
the
crown
and
the
seditious
nobles
ignobly
yielded
their
functions
merely
to
register
royal
decrees
these
contests
rivalries
cabals
and
follies
ending
however
in
the
more
solid
foundations
of
absolute
royal
authority
are
not
to
be
here
discussed
especially
as
nobody
can
thread
that
political
labyrinth
and
we
begin
therefore
not
with
the
technical
reign
of
the
great
king
but
with
his
actual
government
which
took
place
on
the
death
of
mazarin
when
he
was
it
is
said
that
when
that
able
ruler
passed
away
so
reluctantly
from
his
pictures
and
his
government
the
ministers
asked
of
the
young
king
thus
far
only
known
for
his
pleasures
to
whom
they
should
now
bring
their
portfolios
to
me
he
replied
and
from
that
moment
he
became
the
state
and
his
will
the
law
of
the
land
i
have
already
alluded
to
the
talents
and
capacities
of
louis
for
governing
and
the
great
aid
he
derived
from
the
labors
of
richelieu
and
the
moral
sentiments
of
his
age
respecting
royalty
and
religion
so
i
will
not
dwell
on
personal
defects
or
virtues
but
proceed
to
show
the
way
in
which
he
executed
the
task
devolved
upon
him
in
other
words
present
a
brief
history
of
his
government
for
which
he
was
so
well
fitted
by
native
talents
fortunate
circumstances
and
established
ideas
i
will
only
say
that
never
did
a
monarch
enter
upon
his
career
with
such
ample
and
magnificent
opportunities
for
being
a
benefactor
of
his
people
and
of
civilization
in
his
hands
were
placed
all
the
powers
of
good
and
evil
and
so
far
as
government
can
make
a
nation
great
louis
had
the
means
and
opportunities
beyond
those
of
any
monarch
in
modern
times
he
had
armies
and
generals
and
accumulated
treasures
and
all
implicitly
served
him
his
ministers
and
his
generals
were
equally
able
and
supple
and
he
was
at
peace
with
all
the
world
parliaments
nobles
and
huguenots
were
alike
submissive
and
reverential
he
had
inherited
the
experience
of
sully
of
richelieu
and
of
mazarin
his
kingdom
was
protected
by
great
natural
boundaries
the
north
sea
the
ocean
the
mediterranean
the
pyrenees
the
alps
and
the
mountains
which
overlook
the
rhine
by
nothing
was
he
fettered
but
by
the
decrees
of
everlasting
righteousness
to
his
praise
be
it
said
he
inaugurated
his
government
by
selecting
colbert
as
one
of
his
prime
ministers
the
ablest
man
of
his
kingdom
it
was
this
honest
and
astute
servant
of
royalty
who
ferreted
out
the
peculations
of
fouquet
whom
louis
did
not
hesitate
to
disgrace
and
punish
the
great
powers
of
fouquet
were
gradually
bestowed
on
the
merchant
son
of
rheims
colbert
was
a
plebeian
and
a
protestant
cold
severe
reserved
awkward
abrupt
and
ostentatiously
humble
but
of
inflexible
integrity
and
unrivalled
sagacity
and
forethought
more
able
as
a
financier
and
political
economist
than
any
man
of
his
century
it
was
something
for
a
young
proud
and
monarch
to
see
and
reward
the
talents
of
such
a
man
and
colbert
had
the
tact
and
wisdom
to
make
his
young
master
believe
that
all
the
measures
which
he
pursued
originated
in
the
royal
brain
his
great
merit
as
a
minister
consisted
in
developing
the
industrial
resources
of
france
and
providing
the
king
with
money
colbert
was
the
father
of
french
commerce
and
the
creator
of
the
french
navy
he
saw
that
flanders
was
enriched
by
industry
and
england
and
holland
made
powerful
by
a
navy
while
spain
and
portugal
languished
and
declined
with
all
their
mines
of
gold
and
silver
so
he
built
ships
of
war
and
made
harbors
for
them
gave
charters
to
east
and
west
india
companies
planted
colonies
in
india
and
america
decreed
tariffs
to
protect
infant
manufactures
gave
bounties
to
all
kinds
of
artisans
encouraged
manufacturing
industry
and
declared
war
on
the
whole
brood
of
aristocratic
peculators
that
absorbed
the
revenues
of
the
kingdom
he
established
a
better
system
of
accounts
compelled
all
officers
to
reside
at
their
posts
and
reduced
the
percentage
of
the
collection
of
the
public
money
in
thirteen
years
he
increased
the
navy
from
thirty
ships
to
two
hundred
and
one
hundred
of
which
were
ships
of
the
line
he
prepared
a
new
code
of
maritime
law
for
the
government
of
the
navy
which
called
out
universal
admiration
he
dug
the
canal
of
languedoc
which
united
the
mediterranean
with
the
atlantic
ocean
he
instituted
the
academies
of
sciences
of
inscriptions
of
belles
lettres
of
painting
of
sculpture
of
architecture
and
founded
the
school
of
oriental
languages
the
observatory
and
the
school
of
law
he
gave
pensions
to
corneille
racine
molière
and
other
men
of
genius
he
rewarded
artists
and
invited
scholars
to
france
he
repaired
roads
built
bridges
and
directed
the
attention
of
the
middle
classes
to
the
accumulation
of
capital
he
recognized
the
connection
of
works
of
industry
with
the
development
of
genius
he
saw
the
influence
of
science
in
the
production
of
riches
of
taste
on
industry
and
the
fine
arts
on
manual
labor
for
all
these
enlightened
measures
the
king
had
the
credit
and
the
glory
and
it
certainly
redounds
to
his
sagacity
that
he
accepted
such
wise
suggestions
although
he
mistook
them
for
his
own
so
to
the
eyes
of
europe
louis
at
once
loomed
up
as
an
enlightened
monarch
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
rob
him
of
this
glory
he
indorsed
the
economical
reforms
of
his
great
minister
and
rewarded
merit
in
all
departments
which
he
was
not
slow
to
see
the
world
extolled
this
enlightened
and
fortunate
young
prince
and
saw
in
him
a
second
solomon
both
for
wisdom
and
magnificence
another
great
genius
ably
assisted
louis
as
soon
as
he
turned
his
attention
to
war
the
usual
employment
of
ambitious
kings
and
this
was
le
tellier
marquis
of
louvois
the
great
war
minister
who
laid
out
the
campaigns
and
directed
the
movements
of
such
generals
as
condé
turenne
and
luxembourg
and
here
again
it
redounds
to
the
sagacity
of
louis
that
he
should
select
a
man
for
so
great
a
post
whom
he
never
personally
loved
and
who
in
his
gusts
of
passion
would
almost
insult
his
master
louvois
is
acknowledged
to
have
been
the
ablest
war
minister
that
france
ever
had
louis
reigned
peaceably
and
prosperously
for
six
years
before
the
ambition
of
being
a
conqueror
and
a
hero
seized
him
at
he
burned
to
play
the
part
of
alexander
thenceforth
the
history
of
his
reign
chiefly
pertains
to
his
gigantic
wars
some
defensive
but
mostly
offensive
aggressive
and
unprovoked
in
regard
to
these
various
wars
which
plunged
europe
in
mourning
and
rage
for
nearly
fifty
years
louis
is
generally
censured
by
historians
they
were
wars
of
ambition
like
those
of
alexander
and
frederic
until
europe
combined
against
him
and
compelled
him
to
act
on
the
defensive
the
limits
of
this
lecture
necessarily
prevent
me
from
describing
these
wars
i
can
only
allude
to
the
most
important
of
them
and
then
only
to
show
results
his
first
great
war
was
simply
outrageous
and
was
an
insult
to
all
europe
and
a
violation
of
all
international
law
in
with
an
immense
army
he
undertook
the
conquest
of
flanders
with
no
better
excuse
than
frederic
ii
had
for
the
invasion
of
silesia
because
he
wanted
an
increase
of
territory
flanders
had
done
nothing
to
warrant
this
outrage
was
unprepared
for
war
and
was
a
weak
state
but
rich
and
populous
with
fine
harbors
and
flourishing
manufactures
with
nearly
fifty
thousand
men
under
condé
turenne
and
luxembourg
and
other
generals
of
note
aided
by
louvois
who
provided
military
stores
of
every
kind
and
all
under
the
eye
of
the
king
himself
full
of
ideas
of
glory
the
issue
of
the
conflict
was
not
doubtful
in
fact
there
was
no
serious
defence
it
was
hopeless
from
the
first
louis
had
only
to
take
possession
of
cities
and
fortresses
which
were
at
his
mercy
the
frontier
towns
were
mostly
without
fortifications
so
that
it
took
only
about
two
or
three
days
to
conquer
any
city
the
campaign
was
more
a
court
progress
than
a
series
of
battles
it
was
a
sort
of
holiday
sport
for
courtiers
like
a
royal
hunt
the
conquest
of
all
flanders
might
have
been
the
work
of
a
single
campaign
for
no
city
offered
a
stubborn
resistance
but
the
war
was
prolonged
for
another
year
that
louis
might
more
easily
take
possession
of
a
poor
province
but
fertile
in
soil
well
peopled
one
hundred
and
twenty
miles
in
length
and
sixty
in
breadth
in
less
than
three
weeks
this
province
was
added
to
france
louis
said
the
spanish
council
in
derision
might
have
sent
his
de
to
have
taken
possession
of
the
country
in
his
name
and
saved
himself
the
trouble
of
going
in
person
this
successful
raid
seems
to
have
contented
the
king
for
the
time
since
holland
made
signs
of
resistance
and
a
league
was
forming
against
him
embracing
england
holland
and
sweden
the
courtiers
and
flatterers
of
louis
xiv
called
this
unheroic
seizure
glory
and
it
doubtless
added
to
the
dominion
of
france
inflamed
the
people
with
military
ambition
and
caused
the
pride
of
birth
for
the
first
time
to
yield
to
military
talent
and
military
rank
a
marshal
became
a
greater
personage
than
a
duke
although
a
marshal
was
generally
taken
from
the
higher
nobility
louis
paid
no
apparent
penalty
for
this
crime
any
more
than
prosperous
wickedness
at
first
usually
receives
his
eyes
stood
out
with
fatness
to
idolatrous
courtiers
he
had
more
than
heart
could
wish
but
the
penalty
was
to
come
law
can
not
be
violated
with
impunity
the
peace
of
in
followed
which
made
louis
the
most
prominent
figure
in
europe
he
was
then
years
of
age
in
the
pride
of
strength
devoted
equally
to
pleasure
and
ambition
it
was
then
that
he
was
the
lover
of
the
duchesse
de
la
vallière
who
was
soon
to
be
supplanted
by
the
imperious
montespan
louis
remained
at
peace
for
four
years
but
all
the
while
he
was
preparing
for
another
war
aimed
against
holland
which
had
offended
him
because
resolved
to
resist
him
vaster
preparations
were
made
for
this
war
than
that
against
flanders
five
years
before
the
storm
broke
out
in
when
this
little
state
saw
itself
invaded
by
one
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
men
led
by
the
king
in
person
accompanied
by
his
principal
marshals
his
louvois
and
vauban
to
whom
was
intrusted
the
direction
of
siege
operations
an
engineer
who
changed
the
system
of
fortifications
this
was
the
most
magnificent
army
that
europe
had
ever
seen
since
the
crusades
and
much
was
expected
of
it
against
condé
turenne
luxembourg
and
vauban
all
under
the
eye
of
the
king
with
a
powerful
train
of
artillery
and
immense
sums
of
money
to
bribe
the
commanders
of
garrisons
holland
had
only
to
oppose
thousand
soldiers
under
a
sickly
young
man
of
william
prince
of
orange
of
course
holland
was
unable
to
resist
such
an
overwhelming
tide
of
enemies
such
vast
and
disproportionate
forces
city
after
city
and
fortress
after
fortress
was
compelled
to
surrender
to
the
generals
of
the
french
king
they
were
taken
almost
as
soon
as
they
were
invested
all
the
strongholds
on
the
rhine
and
issel
fell
the
prince
of
orange
could
not
even
take
the
field
louis
crossed
the
rhine
without
difficulty
when
the
waters
were
low
with
only
four
or
five
hundred
horsemen
to
dispute
his
passage
this
famous
passage
was
the
subject
of
ridiculous
panegyrics
by
both
painters
and
poets
it
was
generally
regarded
as
a
prodigious
feat
especially
by
the
people
of
paris
as
if
it
were
another
passage
of
the
granicus
then
rapidly
fell
arnheim
nimeguen
utrecht
and
other
cities
the
wealthy
families
of
amsterdam
prepared
to
embark
in
their
ships
for
the
east
indies
nothing
remained
to
complete
the
conquest
of
holland
but
the
surrender
of
amsterdam
which
still
held
out
holland
was
in
despair
and
sent
ambassadors
to
the
camp
of
louis
headed
by
grotius
to
implore
his
mercy
he
received
them
after
protracted
delays
with
blended
insolence
and
arrogance
and
demanded
as
the
conditions
of
his
mercy
that
the
states
should
give
up
all
their
fortified
cities
pay
twenty
millions
of
francs
and
establish
the
catholic
religion
conditions
which
would
have
reduced
the
hollanders
to
absolute
slavery
morally
and
politically
from
an
inspiration
of
blended
patriotism
and
despair
the
dutch
opened
their
dykes
overflowed
the
whole
country
in
possession
of
the
enemy
and
thus
made
amsterdam
impregnable
especially
as
they
were
still
masters
of
the
sea
and
had
just
dispersed
in
a
brilliant
naval
battle
under
de
ruyter
the
combined
fleets
of
france
and
england
it
was
this
memorable
resistance
to
vastly
superior
forces
and
readiness
to
make
any
sacrifices
which
gave
immortal
fame
to
william
of
orange
and
imperishable
glory
also
to
the
little
state
over
which
he
ruled
what
a
spectacle
a
feeble
mercantile
state
without
powerful
allies
bracing
itself
up
to
a
struggle
with
the
mightiest
potentate
of
europe
i
know
no
parallel
to
it
in
the
history
of
modern
times
our
fathers
in
the
revolutionary
war
could
retreat
to
forests
and
mountains
but
holland
had
neither
mountains
nor
forests
there
was
no
escape
from
political
ruin
but
by
the
inundation
of
fertile
fields
the
destruction
to
an
unprecedented
degree
of
private
property
and
the
decimation
of
the
male
part
of
the
population
nor
did
the
noble
defenders
dream
of
victory
they
only
hoped
to
make
a
temporary
stand
william
knew
he
would
be
beaten
in
every
battle
his
courage
was
moral
rather
than
physical
he
lost
no
ground
by
defeat
while
louis
lost
ground
by
victory
since
it
required
a
large
part
of
his
army
to
guard
the
prisoners
and
garrison
the
fortresses
he
had
taken
some
military
writers
say
that
louis
should
have
persevered
until
he
had
taken
amsterdam
as
well
might
napoleon
have
remained
in
russia
after
the
conflagration
of
moscow
in
may
louis
entered
holland
in
july
all
europe
was
in
confederacy
against
him
through
the
negotiations
of
the
prince
of
orange
louis
hastened
to
quit
the
army
when
no
more
conquests
could
be
made
in
a
country
overflowed
with
water
leaving
turenne
and
luxembourg
to
finish
the
war
in
the
able
generals
of
the
french
king
were
obliged
to
evacuate
holland
that
little
state
by
an
act
of
supreme
saved
itself
when
all
seemed
lost
i
do
not
read
of
any
military
mistakes
on
the
part
of
the
generals
of
louis
they
were
baffled
by
an
unforeseen
inundation
and
when
they
were
compelled
to
evacuate
the
flooded
country
the
dutch
quietly
closed
their
dykes
and
pumped
the
water
out
again
into
their
canals
by
their
windmills
and
again
restored
fertility
to
their
fields
and
by
the
time
louis
was
prepared
for
fresh
invasions
a
combination
existed
against
him
so
formidable
that
he
found
it
politic
to
make
peace
the
campaigns
of
turenne
on
the
rhine
were
indeed
successful
but
he
was
killed
in
an
insignificant
battle
from
a
chance
cannonball
while
the
prince
of
condé
retired
forever
from
military
service
after
the
bloody
battle
of
senif
on
the
whole
the
french
were
victorious
in
the
terrible
battles
which
followed
the
evacuation
of
holland
and
louis
dictated
peace
to
europe
apparently
in
the
midst
of
victories
at
nimeguen
in
after
six
years
of
brilliant
fighting
on
both
sides
at
the
peace
of
nimeguen
louis
was
in
the
zenith
of
his
glory
as
napoleon
was
after
the
peace
of
tilsit
he
was
justly
regarded
as
the
mightiest
monarch
of
his
age
the
greatest
king
that
france
had
ever
seen
all
europe
stood
in
awe
of
him
and
with
awe
was
blended
admiration
for
his
resources
were
unimpaired
his
generals
had
greatly
distinguished
themselves
and
he
had
added
important
provinces
to
his
kingdom
which
was
also
enriched
by
the
internal
reforms
of
colbert
and
made
additionally
powerful
by
commerce
and
a
great
navy
which
had
gained
brilliant
victories
over
the
dutch
and
spanish
fleets
duquesne
showed
himself
to
be
almost
as
great
a
genius
in
naval
warfare
as
de
ruyter
who
was
killed
off
aosta
in
in
those
happy
and
prosperous
days
the
hotel
de
ville
conferred
upon
louis
the
title
of
great
which
posterity
never
acknowledged
titles
says
voltaire
are
never
regarded
by
posterity
the
simple
name
of
a
man
who
has
performed
noble
actions
impresses
on
us
more
respect
than
all
the
epithets
that
can
be
invented
after
the
peace
of
nimeguen
in
the
king
reigned
in
greater
splendor
than
before
there
were
no
limits
to
his
arrogance
and
his
extravagance
he
was
a
modern
nebuchadnezzar
he
claimed
to
be
the
state
moi
was
his
proud
exclamation
he
would
bear
no
contradiction
and
no
opposition
the
absorbing
sentiment
of
his
soul
seems
to
have
been
that
france
belonged
to
him
that
it
had
been
given
to
him
as
an
inheritance
to
manage
as
he
pleased
for
his
private
gratification
he
wrote
is
the
noblest
occupation
of
kings
most
writers
affirm
that
personal
aggrandizement
became
the
law
of
his
life
and
that
he
now
began
to
lose
sight
of
the
higher
interests
and
happiness
of
his
people
and
to
reign
not
for
them
but
for
himself
he
became
a
man
of
resentments
of
caprices
of
undisguised
selfishness
he
became
pompous
and
haughty
and
we
palliate
his
and
pride
on
account
of
the
disgraceful
flatteries
he
received
on
every
hand
never
was
a
man
more
extravagantly
lauded
even
by
the
learned
but
had
he
been
half
as
great
as
his
courtiers
made
him
think
he
would
not
have
been
so
intoxicated
caesar
or
charlemagne
would
not
thus
have
lost
his
intellectual
balance
the
strongest
argument
to
prove
that
he
was
not
inherently
great
but
made
apparently
so
by
fortunate
circumstances
is
his
in
his
arrogance
and
presumption
like
napoleon
after
the
peace
of
tilsit
he
now
sets
aside
the
rights
of
other
nations
heaps
galling
insults
on
independent
potentates
and
assumes
the
most
arrogant
tone
in
all
his
relations
with
his
neighbors
or
subjects
he
makes
conquests
in
the
midst
of
peace
he
cites
the
princes
of
europe
before
his
councils
he
deprives
the
elector
palatine
and
the
elector
of
treves
of
some
of
their
most
valuable
seigniories
he
begins
to
persecute
the
protestants
he
seizes
luxembourg
and
the
principality
which
belonged
to
it
he
humbles
the
republic
of
genoa
and
compels
the
doge
to
come
to
versailles
to
implore
his
clemency
he
treats
with
haughty
insolence
the
pope
himself
and
sends
an
ambassador
to
his
court
on
purpose
to
insult
him
he
even
insists
on
giving
an
elector
to
cologne
and
the
same
inflated
pride
and
vanity
which
led
louis
to
trample
on
the
rights
of
other
nations
led
him
into
unbounded
extravagance
in
versailles
arose
at
a
cost
some
affirm
of
a
thousand
millions
of
livres
unrivalled
for
magnificence
since
the
fall
of
the
caesars
in
this
vast
palace
did
he
live
more
after
the
fashion
of
an
oriental
than
an
occidental
monarch
having
enriched
and
furnished
it
with
the
wonders
of
the
world
surrounded
with
princes
marshals
nobles
judges
bishops
ambassadors
poets
artists
philosophers
and
scholars
all
of
whom
rendered
to
him
perpetual
incense
never
was
such
a
grand
court
seen
before
on
this
earth
it
was
one
of
the
great
features
of
the
seventeenth
century
there
was
nothing
censurable
in
collecting
all
the
most
distinguished
and
illustrious
people
of
france
around
him
they
must
have
formed
a
superb
society
from
which
the
proud
monarch
could
learn
much
to
his
enlightenment
but
he
made
them
all
obsequious
courtiers
exacted
from
all
an
idolatrous
homage
and
subjected
them
to
wearisome
ceremonials
he
took
away
their
intellectual
independence
he
banished
racine
because
the
poet
presumed
to
write
a
political
tract
he
made
it
difficult
to
get
access
to
his
person
he
degraded
the
highest
nobles
by
menial
offices
and
insulted
the
nation
by
the
exaltation
of
abandoned
women
who
squandered
the
revenues
of
the
state
in
their
pleasures
and
follies
so
that
this
grand
court
alike
gay
and
servile
intellectual
and
demoralized
became
the
scene
of
perpetual
revels
scandals
and
intrigues
it
was
at
this
period
that
louis
abandoned
himself
to
those
adulterous
pleasures
which
have
ever
disgraced
the
bourbons
yet
scarcely
a
single
woman
by
whom
he
was
for
a
while
enslaved
retained
her
influence
but
a
succession
of
mistresses
arose
blazed
triumphed
and
fell
mancini
the
niece
of
mazarin
was
forsaken
without
the
decency
of
the
slightest
word
of
consolation
la
vallière
the
only
woman
who
probably
ever
loved
him
with
sincerity
and
devotion
had
but
a
brief
reign
and
was
doomed
to
lead
a
dreary
life
of
years
in
penitence
and
neglect
in
a
carmelite
convent
madame
de
montespan
retained
her
ascendency
longer
for
she
had
talents
as
well
as
physical
beauty
she
was
the
most
prodigal
and
imperious
of
all
the
women
that
ever
triumphed
over
the
weakness
of
man
she
reigned
when
louis
was
in
all
the
pride
of
manhood
and
at
the
summit
of
his
greatness
and
fame
accompanying
him
in
his
military
expeditions
presiding
at
his
fetes
receiving
the
incense
of
nobles
the
channel
of
court
favor
the
dispenser
of
honors
but
not
of
offices
for
amid
all
the
slaveries
to
which
women
subjected
the
proudest
man
on
earth
by
the
force
of
physical
charms
he
never
gave
to
them
his
sceptre
it
was
not
till
madame
de
maintenon
supplanted
this
beautiful
and
brilliant
woman
in
the
affections
of
the
king
and
until
he
was
a
victim
of
superstitious
fears
and
had
met
with
great
reverses
that
state
secrets
were
intrusted
to
a
female
friend
for
madame
de
maintenon
was
never
a
mistress
in
the
sense
that
montespan
was
during
this
brilliant
period
of
ten
years
from
the
peace
of
nimeguen
in
to
the
great
uprising
of
the
nations
to
humble
him
in
versailles
and
other
palaces
were
completed
works
of
art
adorned
the
capital
and
immortal
works
of
genius
made
his
reign
illustrious
while
colbert
lived
i
do
not
read
of
any
extraordinary
blunder
on
the
part
of
the
government
perhaps
may
be
considered
a
mistake
since
it
diverted
the
revenues
of
the
kingdom
into
monuments
of
royal
vanity
but
the
sums
lavished
on
architects
gardeners
painters
sculptors
and
those
who
worked
under
them
employed
thousands
of
useful
artisans
created
taste
and
helped
to
civilize
the
people
the
people
profited
by
the
extravagance
of
the
king
and
his
courtiers
the
money
was
spent
in
france
which
was
certainly
better
than
if
it
had
been
expended
in
foreign
wars
it
made
paris
and
versailles
the
most
attractive
cities
of
the
world
it
stimulated
all
the
arts
and
did
not
demoralize
the
nation
would
this
country
be
poorer
and
the
government
less
stable
if
five
hundred
millions
were
expended
at
washington
to
make
it
the
most
beautiful
city
of
the
land
and
create
an
honest
pride
even
among
the
representatives
of
the
west
perhaps
diverting
them
from
building
another
capital
on
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
would
this
country
be
richer
if
great
capitalists
locked
up
their
money
in
state
securities
instead
of
spending
their
superfluous
wealth
in
reclaiming
sterile
tracts
and
converting
them
into
gardens
and
parks
the
very
magnificence
of
louis
impressed
such
a
people
as
the
french
with
the
idea
of
his
power
and
tended
to
make
the
government
secure
until
subsequent
wars
imposed
such
excessive
taxation
as
to
impoverish
the
people
and
drain
the
sources
of
national
wealth
we
do
not
read
that
colbert
made
serious
remonstrances
to
the
of
the
king
although
afterwards
louis
regarded
it
as
one
of
the
errors
of
his
reign
but
when
colbert
died
in
another
spirit
seemed
to
animate
the
councils
of
the
king
and
great
mistakes
were
made
which
is
the
more
noteworthy
since
the
moral
character
of
the
king
seemed
to
improve
it
was
at
this
time
that
he
fell
under
the
influence
of
madame
de
maintenon
and
the
jesuits
they
made
his
court
more
decorous
montespan
was
sent
away
bossuet
and
la
chaise
gained
great
ascendency
over
the
royal
conscience
louis
began
to
realize
his
responsibilities
the
love
of
glory
waned
the
welfare
of
the
people
was
now
considered
whether
he
was
with
pleasure
or
saw
things
in
a
different
light
or
felt
the
influence
of
the
but
accomplished
and
virtuous
woman
whom
he
made
his
wife
or
was
disturbed
by
the
storm
which
was
gathering
in
the
political
horizon
he
became
more
thoughtful
and
grave
though
not
less
tyrannical
yet
it
was
then
that
he
made
the
most
fatal
mistake
of
his
life
the
evil
consequences
of
which
pursued
him
to
his
death
he
revoked
the
edict
of
nantes
which
henry
iv
had
granted
and
which
had
secured
religious
toleration
this
he
did
from
a
perverted
conscience
wishing
to
secure
the
unanimity
and
triumph
of
the
catholic
faith
to
this
he
was
incited
by
the
best
woman
with
whom
he
was
ever
brought
in
intimate
relations
in
this
he
was
encouraged
by
all
the
religious
bigots
of
his
kingdom
he
committed
a
monstrous
crime
that
good
might
come
not
foreseeing
the
ultimate
consequences
and
showing
anything
but
an
enlarged
statesmanship
this
stupid
folly
alienated
his
best
subjects
and
sowed
the
seeds
of
revolution
in
the
next
reign
and
tended
to
undermine
the
throne
richelieu
never
would
have
consented
to
such
an
insane
measure
for
this
cruel
act
not
only
destroyed
veneration
at
home
but
created
detestation
among
all
enlightened
foreigners
it
is
a
hackneyed
saying
that
the
blood
of
martyrs
is
the
seed
of
the
church
but
it
would
seem
that
the
persecution
of
the
protestants
was
an
exception
to
this
truth
and
a
persecution
all
the
more
needless
and
revolting
since
the
protestants
were
not
in
rebellion
against
the
government
as
in
the
tune
of
charles
ix
this
diabolical
persecution
justified
however
by
some
of
the
greatest
men
in
france
had
its
intended
results
the
bigots
who
incited
that
crime
had
studied
well
the
principles
of
successful
warfare
as
early
as
the
king
was
urged
to
suppress
the
protestant
religion
and
long
before
the
edict
of
nantes
was
revoked
the
protestants
had
been
subjected
to
humiliation
and
annoyance
if
they
held
places
at
court
they
were
required
to
sell
them
if
they
were
advocates
they
were
forbidden
to
plead
if
they
were
physicians
they
were
prevented
from
visiting
patients
they
were
gradually
excluded
from
appointments
in
the
army
and
navy
little
remained
to
them
except
commerce
and
manufactures
protestants
could
not
hold
catholics
as
servants
soldiers
were
unjustly
quartered
upon
them
their
taxes
were
multiplied
their
petitions
were
unread
but
in
dragonnades
subjected
them
to
still
greater
cruelties
who
tore
up
their
linen
for
camp
beds
and
emptied
their
mattresses
for
litters
the
poor
unoffending
protestants
filled
the
prisons
and
dyed
the
scaffolds
with
their
blood
they
were
prohibited
under
the
severest
penalties
from
the
exercise
of
their
religion
their
ministers
were
exiled
their
children
were
baptized
in
the
catholic
faith
their
property
was
confiscated
and
all
attempts
to
flee
the
country
were
punished
by
the
galleys
two
millions
of
people
were
disfranchised
two
hundred
thousand
perished
by
the
executioners
or
in
prisons
or
in
the
galleys
all
who
could
fly
escaped
to
other
countries
and
those
who
escaped
were
among
the
most
useful
citizens
carrying
their
arts
with
them
to
enrich
countries
at
war
with
france
some
two
hundred
thousand
contrived
to
fly
thus
weakening
the
kingdom
and
filling
europe
with
their
execrations
never
did
a
crime
have
so
little
justification
and
never
was
a
crime
followed
with
severer
retribution
yet
le
tellier
the
chancellor
at
the
age
of
eighty
thanked
god
that
he
was
permitted
the
exalted
privilege
of
affixing
the
seal
of
his
office
to
the
act
before
he
died
madame
de
maintenon
declared
that
it
would
cover
louis
with
glory
madame
de
sévigné
said
that
no
royal
ordinance
had
ever
been
more
magnificent
hardly
a
protest
came
from
any
person
of
influence
in
the
land
not
even
from
fénelon
the
great
bossuet
at
the
funeral
of
le
tellier
thus
broke
out
let
us
publish
this
miracle
of
our
day
and
pour
out
our
hearts
in
praise
of
the
piety
of
louis
this
new
constantine
this
new
theodosius
this
new
charlemagne
through
whose
hands
heresy
is
no
more
the
pope
though
at
this
time
hostile
to
louis
celebrated
a
te
deum
among
those
who
fled
the
kingdom
to
other
lands
were
nine
thousand
sailors
and
twelve
thousand
soldiers
headed
by
marshal
schomberg
and
admiral
duquesne
the
best
general
and
the
best
naval
officer
that
france
then
had
other
distinguished
people
transferred
their
services
to
foreign
courts
the
learned
claude
who
fled
to
holland
gave
to
the
world
an
eloquent
picture
of
the
persecution
jurieu
by
his
burning
pamphlets
excited
the
insurrection
of
cévennes
basnage
and
rapin
the
historians
saurin
the
great
preacher
papin
the
eminent
scientist
and
other
eminent
men
all
exiles
weakened
the
supports
of
louis
france
was
impoverished
in
every
way
by
this
great
miracle
of
the
reign
so
that
says
martin
the
new
temple
that
louis
had
pretended
to
erect
to
unity
fell
to
ruin
as
it
rose
from
the
ground
and
left
only
an
open
chasm
in
place
of
its
foundations
the
nothingness
of
absolute
government
by
one
alone
was
revealed
under
the
very
reign
of
the
great
king
the
rebound
of
the
revocation
overthrew
all
the
barriers
within
which
louis
had
intrenched
himself
all
the
smothered
fires
of
hatred
and
of
vengeance
were
kindled
anew
in
holland
and
in
every
protestant
country
william
of
orange
headed
the
confederation
of
hostile
states
that
dreaded
the
ascendency
and
detested
the
policy
of
louis
xiv
all
europe
was
resolved
on
the
humiliation
of
a
man
it
both
feared
and
hated
the
great
war
which
began
in
when
william
of
orange
became
king
of
england
on
the
flight
of
james
was
not
sought
by
louis
this
war
can
not
be
laid
to
his
military
ambition
he
provoked
it
indeed
indirectly
by
his
arrogance
and
religious
persecutions
but
on
his
part
it
was
as
truly
defensive
as
were
the
wars
of
napoleon
after
the
invasion
of
russia
whatever
is
truly
heroic
in
the
character
of
louis
was
seen
after
he
was
whatever
claims
to
greatness
he
may
have
had
are
only
to
be
sustained
by
the
memorable
resistance
he
made
to
united
europe
in
arms
against
him
when
his
great
ministers
and
his
best
generals
had
died
turenne
died
in
colbert
in
condé
in
le
tellier
in
and
louvois
in
then
it
was
that
his
great
reverses
began
and
his
glory
paled
before
the
sun
of
the
king
of
england
these
reverses
may
have
been
the
result
of
incapacity
and
they
may
have
been
the
result
of
the
combined
forces
which
outnumbered
or
overmatched
his
own
certain
it
is
that
in
the
terrible
contest
to
which
he
was
now
doomed
he
showed
great
force
of
character
and
great
fortitude
which
command
our
respect
i
can
not
enter
on
that
long
war
which
began
with
the
league
of
augsburg
in
and
continued
to
the
peace
of
ryswick
in
nine
years
of
desperate
fighting
when
successes
and
defeats
were
nearly
balanced
and
when
the
resources
of
all
the
contending
parties
were
nearly
exhausted
france
at
the
close
of
the
war
was
despoiled
of
all
her
conquests
and
all
the
additions
to
her
territory
made
since
the
peace
of
nimeguen
except
strasburg
and
alsace
for
the
first
time
since
the
accession
of
richelieu
to
power
france
lost
ground
the
interval
between
this
war
and
that
of
the
spanish
succession
an
interval
of
three
years
was
only
marked
by
the
ascendency
of
madame
de
maintenon
and
a
renewed
persecution
directed
not
against
protestants
but
against
those
catholics
who
cultivated
the
highest
and
freest
religious
life
and
in
which
bossuet
appears
to
a
great
disadvantage
by
the
side
of
his
rival
the
equally
illustrious
fénelon
it
was
also
marked
by
the
gradual
disappearance
of
the
great
lights
in
literature
la
fontaine
died
in
racine
in
boileau
was
as
good
as
dead
mesdames
de
la
sablière
and
de
la
fayette
pellisson
and
la
bruyère
and
madame
sévigné
all
died
about
this
time
the
only
great
men
at
the
close
of
the
century
in
france
who
made
their
genius
felt
were
bossuet
who
encouraged
the
narrow
intolerance
which
aimed
to
suppress
the
jansenists
and
quietists
and
fénelon
who
protected
them
although
he
did
not
join
them
the
eagle
of
meaux
and
the
swan
of
cambray
as
they
were
called
offering
in
the
realm
of
art
the
eternal
duality
of
strength
and
grace
like
michael
angelo
and
raphael
the
one
inspiring
the
fear
and
the
other
the
love
of
god
yet
both
seeing
in
the
christian
religion
the
highest
hopes
of
the
world
the
internal
history
of
this
period
centres
around
those
pious
mystics
of
whom
madame
guyon
was
the
representative
and
those
inquiring
intellectual
jansenists
who
had
defied
the
jesuits
but
were
finally
crushed
by
an
intolerant
government
the
lamentable
dispute
between
bossuet
and
fénelon
also
then
occurred
which
led
to
the
disgrace
of
the
latter
as
banishment
to
his
diocese
was
regarded
but
in
his
exile
his
moral
influence
was
increased
rather
than
diminished
while
the
publication
of
his
télémaque
made
without
his
consent
from
a
copy
that
had
been
abstracted
from
him
won
him
france
and
europe
though
it
rendered
louis
xiv
forever
irreconcilable
bossuet
did
not
long
survive
the
banishment
of
his
rival
and
died
in
a
month
before
bourdaloue
and
two
years
before
bayle
france
intellectually
under
the
despotic
intolerance
of
the
king
was
going
through
an
eclipse
or
hastening
to
a
dissolution
while
the
material
state
of
the
country
showed
signs
of
approaching
bankruptcy
the
people
were
exhausted
by
war
and
taxes
and
all
the
internal
improvements
which
colbert
had
stimulated
were
neglected
the
fisheries
of
normandy
were
ruined
and
the
pasture
lands
of
alsace
were
taken
from
the
peasantry
picardy
lost
a
twelfth
part
of
its
population
many
large
cities
were
almost
abandoned
in
normandy
out
of
seven
hundred
thousand
people
there
were
but
fifty
thousand
who
did
not
sleep
on
straw
the
linen
manufactures
of
brittany
were
destroyed
by
the
heavy
duties
touraine
lost
of
her
population
the
silk
trade
of
tours
was
ruined
the
population
of
troyes
fell
from
sixty
thousand
to
twenty
thousand
lyons
lost
twenty
thousand
souls
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
in
spite
of
these
calamities
the
blinded
king
prepared
for
another
exhausting
war
in
order
to
put
his
grandson
on
the
throne
of
spain
this
last
and
most
ruinous
of
all
his
wars
might
have
been
averted
if
he
only
could
have
cast
away
his
ambition
and
his
pride
humbled
and
crippled
he
yet
could
not
part
with
the
prize
which
fell
to
his
family
by
the
death
of
carlos
ii
of
spain
but
europe
was
determined
that
the
bourbons
should
not
be
further
aggrandized
thus
in
war
broke
out
with
even
intensified
animosities
and
lasted
twelve
years
directed
on
the
one
part
by
marlborough
eugene
and
heinsius
and
on
the
other
part
by
villars
vendôme
and
catinat
during
which
the
finances
of
france
were
ruined
and
the
people
reduced
to
frightful
misery
it
was
then
that
louis
melted
up
the
medallions
of
his
former
victories
to
provide
food
for
his
starving
soldiers
he
offered
immense
concessions
which
the
allies
against
him
rejected
he
was
obliged
to
continue
the
contest
with
exhausted
resources
and
a
saddened
soul
he
offered
marlborough
four
millions
to
use
his
influence
to
procure
a
peace
but
this
general
venal
as
he
was
preferred
ambition
to
money
the
despair
which
once
overwhelmed
holland
now
overtook
france
the
french
marshals
encountered
a
greater
general
than
william
whose
greatness
was
in
the
heroism
of
his
soul
and
his
diplomatic
talents
rather
than
in
his
genius
on
the
battlefield
but
marlborough
who
led
the
allies
never
lost
a
battle
nor
besieged
a
fortress
he
did
not
take
his

to
transfer
his
operations
from
flanders
to
the
danube
at
blenheim
was
fought
one
of
the
decisive
battles
of
the
world
in
which
the
teutonic
nations
were
marshalled
against
the
french
the
battle
of
ramillies
completed
the
deliverance
of
flanders
and
louis
completely
humiliated
agreed
to
give
up
ten
flemish
provinces
to
the
dutch
and
to
surrender
to
the
emperor
of
germany
all
that
france
had
gained
since
the
peace
of
westphalia
in
he
also
agreed
to
acknowledge
anne
as
queen
of
great
britain
and
to
banish
the
pretender
from
his
dominions
england
was
to
retain
gibraltar
and
spain
to
cede
to
the
emperor
of
germany
her
possessions
in
italy
and
the
netherlands
but
france
with
all
her
disasters
was
not
ruined
the
treaty
of
utrecht
left
louis
nearly
all
his
inherited
possessions
except
in
america
louis
was
now
an
old
man
whose
delusions
were
dispelled
and
to
whom
successive
misfortunes
had
brought
grief
and
shame
he
was
deprived
by
death
of
his
son
and
grandson
who
gave
promise
of
rare
virtues
and
abilities
only
a
feeble
infant
his
was
the
heir
of
the
monarchy
all
his
vast
enterprises
had
failed
he
suffered
to
all
appearance
a
righteous
retribution
for
his
early
passion
for
military
glory
he
had
invaded
the
rights
of
holland
and
holland
gave
him
no
rest
until
with
the
aid
of
the
surrounding
monarchies
france
was
driven
to
the
verge
of
ruin
he
had
destroyed
the
cities
of
the
palatinate
and
the
rhine
provinces
became
a
wall
of
fire
against
his
armies
he
had
conspired
against
liberty
in
england
and
it
was
from
england
that
he
experienced
the
most
fatal
opposition
his
wars
from
which
he
had
expected
glory
ended
at
last
in
the
curtailment
of
his
original
possessions
his
palaces
which
had
excited
the
admiration
of
europe
became
the
monuments
of
extravagance
and
folly
his
persecutions
by
which
he
hoped
to
secure
religious
unity
sowed
the
seeds
of
discontent
anarchy
and
revolution
he
left
his
kingdom
politically
weaker
than
it
was
when
he
took
it
he
entailed
nothing
but
disasters
to
his
heirs
his
very
grants
and
pensions
were
subversive
of
intellectual
dignity
and
independence
at
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
great
lights
had
disappeared
he
survived
his
fame
his
generals
his
family
and
his
friends
the
infirmities
of
age
oppressed
his
body
and
the
agonies
of
religious
fears
disturbed
his
soul
we
see
no
greatness
but
in
his
magnificence
we
strip
him
of
all
claims
to
genius
and
even
to
enlightened
statesmanship
and
feel
that
his
undoubted
skill
in
holding
the
reins
of
government
must
be
ascribed
to
the
weakness
and
degradation
of
his
subjects
rather
than
to
his
own
strength
but
the
verdicts
of
the
last
and
present
generation
of
historians
educated
with
hatred
of
irresponsible
power
may
be
again
reversed
and
louis
xiv
may
loom
up
in
another
age
if
not
as
the
whom
his
contemporaries
worshipped
yet
as
a
man
of
great
natural
abilities
who
made
fatal
mistakes
and
who
like
napoleon
after
him
alternately
elevated
and
depressed
the
nation
over
which
he
was
called
to
reign
not
like
napoleon
as
a
usurper
and
a
fraud
but
as
an
honest
though
proud
and
ambitious
sovereign
who
was
supposed
to
rule
by
divine
right
of
whom
the
nations
of
europe
were
jealous
who
lived
in
fear
and
hatred
of
his
power
and
who
finally
conspired
not
to
rob

remote
causes
of
revolution
it
is
impossible
to
contemplate
the
inglorious
reign
of
louis
xv
otherwise
than
as
a
more
complete
development
of
the
egotism
which
marked
the
life
of
his
immediate
predecessor
and
a
still
more
fruitful
nursery
of
those
vices
and
discontents
which
prepared
the
way
for
the
french
revolution
it
is
in
fact
in
connection
with
that
great
event
that
this
reign
should
be
considered
the
fabric
of
despotism
had
already
been
built
by
richelieu
and
louis
xiv
had
displayed
and
gloried
in
its
dazzling
magnificence
even
while
he
undermined
its
foundations
by
his
ruinous
wars
and
courtly
extravagance
under
louis
xv
we
shall
see
even
greater
recklessness
in
profitless
expenditures
and
more
complete
abandonment
to
the
pleasures
which
were
purchased
by
the
burdens
and
sorrows
of
his
people
we
shall
see
the
monarch
and
his
court
still
more
subversive
of
the
prosperity
and
dignity
of
the
nation
and
even
indifferent
to
the
signs
of
that
coming
storm
which
later
overturned
the
throne
of
his
grandson
louis
xvi
and
louis
xv
was
not
only
the
author
of
new
calamities
but
the
heir
of
seventy
years
misrule
all
the
evils
which
resulted
from
the
wars
and
wasteful
extravagance
of
louis
xiv
became
additional
perplexities
with
which
he
had
to
contend
but
these
evils
instead
of
removing
he
only
aggravated
by
follies
which
surpassed
all
the
excesses
of
the
preceding
reign
if
i
were
asked
to
point
out
the
most
efficient
though
indirect
authors
of
the
french
revolution
i
would
single
out
those
royal
tyrants
themselves
who
sat
upon
the
throne
of
henry
iv
during
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
i
shall
proceed
to
state
the
principal
events
and
features
which
have
rendered
that
reign
both
noted
and
ignominious
in
contemplating
the
long
reign
of
louis
xv
whom
i
present
as
a
necessary
link
in
the
political
history
of
the
eighteenth
century
rather
than
as
one
of
the
beacon
lights
of
civilization
we
first
naturally
turn
our
eyes
to
the
leading
external
events
by
which
it
is
marked
in
history
and
we
have
to
observe
in
reference
to
these
that
they
were
generally
unpropitious
to
the
greatness
and
glory
of
france
nearly
all
those
which
emanated
from
the
government
had
an
unfortunate
or
disgraceful
issue
no
success
attended
the
french
arms
in
any
quarter
of
the
world
with
the
exception
of
the
victories
of
marshal
saxe
at
fontenoy
and
the
french
lost
the
reputation
they
had
previously
acquired
under
henry
condé
turenne
and
luxembourg
disgrace
attended
the
generals
who
were
sent
against
frederic
in
the
seven
years
war
even
greater
than
what
had
previously
resulted
from
the
contests
with
the
english
and
the
dutch
and
which
were
brought
to
a
close
by
the
peace
of
in
but
it
was
not
on
the
fields
of
germany
that
the
greatest
disasters
happened
the
french
were
rifled
of
their
possessions
both
in
america
and
in
india
louisbourg
yielded
to
the
bravery
of
new
england
troops
and
finally
canada
itself
was
lost
all
dreams
of
establishing
a
new
empire
on
the
mississippi
and
the
gulf
of
lawrence
vanished
for
ever
while
madras
and
calcutta
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
english
with
all
the
riches
of
mahometan
and
mogul
empires
during
the
regency
of
the
duke
of
orleans
for
louis
xv
was
an
infant
five
years
of
age
when
his
died
in
we
notice
the
disgraceful
speculations
which
followed
the
schemes
of
law
and
which
resulted
in
the
ruin
of
thousands
and
the
still
greater
derangement
of
the
national
finances
the
most
respectable
part
of
the
reign
of
louis
xv
were
those
seventeen
years
when
the
administration
was
hi
the
hands
of
cardinal
fleury
who
succeeded
the
duke
of
bourbon
to
whom
the
reins
of
government
had
been
intrusted
after
the
death
of
the
duke
of
orleans
two
years
before
the
young
king
had
attained
his
majority
though
the
cardinal
was
a
man
of
peace
was
irreproachable
in
morals
patriotic
in
his
intentions
and
succeeded
in
restoring
for
a
time
the
credit
of
the
country
still
even
he
only
warded
off
difficulties
like
sir
robert
walpole
instead
of
bravely
meeting
them
before
it
should
be
too
late
his
timid
rule
was
a
negative
rather
than
a
positive
blessing
but
with
his
death
ended
all
prosperity
and
the
reign
of
mistresses
and
infamous
favorites
began
the
great
feature
of
the
times
on
which
i
shall
presently
speak
more
fully
as
one
of
the
indirect
causes
of
subsequent
revolution
in
singling
out
and
generalizing
the
evils
and
public
misfortunes
of
the
reign
of
louis
perhaps
the
derangement
of
the
finances
was
the
most
important
in
its
political
results
but
for
this
misfortune
the
king
was
not
wholly
responsible
a
vast
national
debt
was
the
legacy
of
louis
xiv
this
was
the
fruit
of
his
miserable
attempt
at
this
was
the
residuum
of
his
glories
yet
as
a
national
debt
according
to
some
is
no
calamity
but
rather
a
blessing
a
chain
of
loyalty
and
love
to
bind
the
people
together
in
harmonious
action
and
mutual
interest
and
especially
the
middle
classes
upon
whom
it
chiefly
falls
to
the
support
of
a
glorious
throne
we
must
not
waste
time
by
dwelling
on
the
existence
of
this
debt
a
peculiarity
which
has
attended
the
highest
triumphs
of
civilization
an
invention
of
honored
statesmen
and
patriotic
ministers
and
perhaps
their
benignant
boon
to
future
generations
but
rather
we
will
look
to
the
way
it
was
sought
to
be
discharged
louis
xiv
spent
in
wars
fifteen
hundred
millions
of
livres
and
in
palaces
about
three
hundred
millions
more
and
his
various
other
expenses
which
could
not
be
well
defrayed
by
taxation
swelled
the
amount
due
to
his
creditors
at
his
death
to
nearly
two
thousand
millions
a
vast
sum
for
those
times
the
regent
duke
of
orleans
who
succeeded
him
increased
this
debt
still
more
especially
by
his
reckless
and
infamous
prodigalities
under
the
direction
of
his
prime
minister
his
old
friend
and
tutor
cardinal
dubois
at
last
his
embarrassments
were
so
great
that
the
wheels
of
government
were
likely
to
stop
his
friend
the
due
de
saint
simon
one
of
the
great
patricians
of
the
court
proposed
as
a
remedy
national
bankruptcy
affirming
that
it
would
be
a
salutary
lesson
to
the
rich
plebeian
capitalists
not
to
lend
their
money
an
ingenious
scotch
financier
however
proposed
a
more
palatable
scheme
which
was
to
make
use
of
the
credit
of
the
nation
for
a
bank
the
capital
of
which
should
be
guaranteed
by
shares
in
the
mississippi
company
john
law
already
a
wealthy
and
prosperous
banker
proposed
to
increase
the
paper
currency
and
supersede
the
use
of
gold
and
silver
his
offer
was
accepted
and
his
bank
became
a
royal
one
its
bills
going
at
once
into
circulation
now
as
the
most
absurd
delusions
existed
as
to
the
wealth
of
louisiana
and
the
most
boundless
faith
was
placed
in
law
financiering
and
as
only
law
bills
could
purchase
shares
in
the
company
which
was
to
make
fortune
gold
and
silver
flowed
to
his
bank
the
shares
of
the
company
continued
to
rise
in
value
and
were
indefinitely
issued
in
a
little
while
six
hundred
and
forty
millions
of
livres
in
these
bills
were
in
circulation
and
soon
after
nearly
half
of
the
national
debt
was
paid
off
in
other
words
people
had
been
induced
to
exchange
government
securities
to
the
amount
of
eight
hundred
millions
for
the
mississippi
stock
they
sold
consols
at
law
bank
and
were
paid
in
his
bills
with
which
they
bought
shares
the
bills
of
the
bank
were
of
course
redeemable
in
gold
and
silver
but
for
a
time
nobody
wanted
gold
and
silver
so
great
was
the
credit
of
the
bank
moreover
the
bank
itself
was
guaranteed
by
the
shares
of
the
company
which
were
worth
at
one
period
twelve
times
their
original
value
john
law
of
course
was
regarded
as
a
national
benefactor
his
financiering
had
saved
a
nation
and
who
had
ever
before
heard
of
a
nation
being
saved
by
all
sorts
of
homage
and
honors
were
showered
upon
so
great
a
man
his
house
was
thronged
with
dukes
and
peers
he
became
of
the
finances
and
virtually
he
was
elected
a
member
of
the
french
academy
his
fame
extended
far
and
wide
for
he
was
a
beneficent
deity
that
had
made
everybody
rich
and
no
one
poor
surely
the
golden
age
had
come
paris
was
crowded
with
strangers
from
all
parts
of
the
world
who
came
to
see
a
man
whose
wisdom
surpassed
that
of
solomon
and
who
made
silver
and
gold
to
be
as
stones
in
the
streets
as
everybody
had
grown
rich
twelve
hundred
new
coaches
were
set
up
nothing
was
seen
but
new
furniture
and
costly
apparel
nothing
was
felt
but
universal
exhilaration
so
great
was
the
delusion
that
the
stock
of
the
mississippi
company
reached
the
almost
fabulous
amount
of
three
thousand
six
hundred
millions
nearly
twice
the
amount
of
the
national
debt
but
as
law
bank
where
all
these
transactions
were
made
revealed
none
of
its
transactions
the
public
were
in
ignorance
of
the
bills
issued
and
stock
created
at
last
the
prince
of
conti
one
of
the
most
powerful
of
the
nobles
and
a
prince
of
the
who
had
received
enormous
amounts
in
bills
as
the
price
of
his
protection
annoyed
to
find
that
his
demands
were
finally
resisted
presented
his
notes
at
the
bank
and
of
course
obtained
gold
and
silver
then
other
nobles
did
the
same
and
then
foreign
merchants
until
the
bank
was
drained
then
came
the
panic
then
the
fall
of
stocks
then
general
ruin
then
universal
despondency
and
rage
the
bubble
had
burst
four
hundred
thousand
families
who
thought
themselves
rich
and
who
had
been
comfortable
were
hopelessly
ruined
but
the
state
had
got
rid
of
half
the
national
debt
and
for
a
time
was
clear
of
embarrassment
the
people
however
had
been
defrauded
and
deceived
by
government
and
they
rendered
in
return
their
secret
curses
the
foundations
of
a
throne
are
only
secured
by
the
affections
of
a
people
if
these
are
destroyed
one
great
element
of
regal
power
is
lost
under
the
administration
of
cardinal
fleury
the
finances
were
somewhat
improved
since
he
aimed
at
economical
arrangements
especially
in
the
collection
of
taxes
he
attempted
to
imitate
sully
and
colbert
but
without
their
genius
and
boldness
he
effected
but
little
he
had
an
unfortunate
quarrel
with
the
parliament
of
paris
and
was
obliged
to
repeal
a
favorite
measure
after
his
death
the
country
was
virtually
ruled
by
the
king
mistress
madame
de
pompadour
who
displaced
ministers
at
her
pleasure
and
who
encouraged
unbounded
extravagance
the
public
deficit
increased
continually
until
it
finally
amounted
to
nearly
two
hundred
millions
in
a
single
year
in
spite
of
this
increasing
derangement
of
the
finances
the
court
had
not
the
courage
or
will
to
face
the
difficulties
but
resorted
to
new
loans
and
forced
contributions
and
every
form
of
iniquitous
taxation
if
a
great
functionary
announced
the
necessity
of
economy
or
order
he
was
forthwith
disgraced
nothing
irritated
the
court
more
than
any
proposal
to
reduce
unnecessary
expenses
nor
would
any
other
order
either
the
nobles
or
the
clergy
consent
to
make
sacrifices
in
such
a
state
of
things
a
most
oppressive
system
of
taxation
was
the
necessary
result
in
no
country
in
modern
times
have
the
burdens
of
the
people
been
so
great
taxes
were
imposed
to
the
utmost
extent
that
they
were
able
to
bear
without
their
consent
and
upon
the
slightest
resistance
or
remonstrance
they
were
imprisoned
and
treated
as
criminals
so
great
were
the
taxes
on
land
that
nearly
of
the
whole
gross
produce
it
has
been
estimated
went
to
the
state
and
of
the
remainder
to
the
landlord
the
peasant
thus
only
received
about
of
the
fruit
of
his
labors
and
on
this
pittance
his
family
was
supported
taxes
were
both
direct
and
indirect
levied
upon
every
article
of
consumption
upon
everything
that
was
imported
or
exported
upon
income
upon
capital
upon
the
transmission
of
property
upon
even
the
few
privileges
which
were
enjoyed
but
not
that
was
collected
went
to
the
royal
treasury
it
was
wasted
by
the
different
collectors
and
in
addition
to
the
ordinary
burdens
were
enormous
monopolies
granted
to
nobles
and
courtiers
by
which
the
income
of
the
state
was
indirectly
plundered
the
poor
man
groaned
amid
his
heavy
labors
and
great
privations
without
exciting
compassion
or
securing
redress
and
in
addition
to
his
taxes
the
laborer
was
deprived
of
all
the
privileges
of
freedom
he
was
injured
downtrodden
mocked
and
insulted
the
laws
were
unequal
and
gave
him
no
security
game
of
the
most
destructive
kind
was
permitted
to
run
at
large
through
the
fields
and
yet
the
people
were
not
allowed
to
shoot
a
hare
or
a
deer
upon
their
own
grounds
numerous
edicts
prohibited
hoeing
and
weeding
lest
young
partridges
should
be
destroyed
the
people
were
bound
to
repair
the
roads
without
compensation
to
grind
their
corn
at
the
landlord
mill
bake
their
bread
in
his
ovens
and
carry
their
grapes
to
his
they
had
not
the
benefit
of
schools
or
of
institutions
which
would
enable
them
to
improve
their
minds
they
could
not
rise
above
the
miserable
condition
in
which
they
were
born
or
even
make
their
complaints
heard
feudalism
in
all
its
social
distinctions
and
in
all
its
oppressive
burdens
crushed
them
as
with
an
iron
weight
or
bound
them
as
with
iron
fetters
this
weight
they
could
not
throw
off
these
fetters
they
could
not
break
there
was
no
alternative
but
in
submission
forced
submission
to
overwhelming
taxes
robberies
insults
and
injustice
both
from
landed
proprietors
and
the
officers
of
the
crown
those
however
who
lived
upon
the
unrequited
toil
of
the
people
lived
out
of
sight
of
their
sorrows
not
in
beautiful
châteaux
as
their
ancestors
did
by
the
side
of
placid
rivers
and
on
the
skirts
of
romantic
forests
or
amid
vineyards
and
but
in
the
capital
or
the
court
here
like
roman
senators
of
old
they
squandered
the
money
which
they
had
obtained
by
extortion
and
corruption
of
every
sort
amid
the
palaces
of
versailles
they
displayed
all
the
vanities
of
dress
all
the
luxuries
of
their
favored
life
here
as
lesser
stars
they
revolved
around
the
great
central
orb
of
regal
splendor
proud
to
belong
to
another
world
than
that
in
which
the
plebeian
millions
toiled
and
suffered
at
versailles
they
attempted
to
ignore
their
own
humanity
to
forget
their
most
pressing
duties
and
to
despise
the
only
pursuits
which
could
have
elevated
their
minds
or
warmed
their
hearts
but
they
were
not
great
feudal
nobles
like
the
guises
and
the
epernons
such
as
combined
to
awe
even
regal
power
under
the
house
of
valois
men
who
could
coin
money
and
exercise
judicial
authority
in
their
own
domain
but
timid
and
subservient
courtiers
as
embarrassed
in
their
affairs
as
was
the
king
himself
nevertheless
many
of
the
ancient
privileges
of
feudalism
were
enjoyed
by
them
they
were
exempt
from
many
taxes
which
oppressed
merchants
and
farmers
they
alone
were
appointed
to
command
in
the
army
and
navy
they
alone
were
made
prelates
and
dignitaries
in
the
church
they
were
comparatively
free
from
arrest
when
their
crimes
were
against
society
and
god
rather
than
the
government
they
were
distinguished
from
the
plebeian
class
by
dress
as
well
as
by
privileges
and
they
only
had
access
to
court
and
a
share
in
the
plunder
of
the
kingdom
craving
greater
excitements
than
that
which
even
versailles
afforded
they
built
in
the
faubourg
germain
those
magnificent
hotels
which
are
still
the
dreary
but
imposing
monuments
of
aristocratic
pride
and
here
they
plunged
into
every
form
of
excess
and
folly
for
which
paris
has
always
been
distinguished
but
it
was
in
their
splendid
equipages
and
in
their
boxes
at
the
opera
that
they
displayed
the
most
striking
contrast
to
the
habits
of
the
plebeian
people
with
whom
they
were
surrounded
their
embroidered
vests
their
costly
silks
and
satins
their
emerald
and
diamond
buckles
their
ruffles
their
rare
furs
their
jewelled
rapiers
and
their
perfumed
handkerchiefs
were
peculiar
to
themselves
for
in
those
days
wealthy
shopkeepers
and
even
the
daughters
of
prosperous
notaries
could
ill
afford
such
luxuries
and
were
scarcely
allowed
to
shine
in
them
if
they
would
a
velvet
coat
then
cost
more
than
one
thousand
francs
while
the
ruffs
and
frills
and
diamond
studs
and
and
other
appendages
to
the
dress
of
a
gentleman
swelled
the
amount
to
scarcely
less
than
forty
thousand
francs
or
sixteen
hundred
if
a
distinguished
advocate
was
admitted
to
the
presence
of
royalty
he
must
appear
in
simple
black
gorgeous
dresses
were
reserved
only
for
the
some
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
privileged
persons
all
the
rest
were
marked
by
some
emblem
of
meanness
or
inferiority
whatever
might
be
their
intellectual
and
moral
worth
never
were
the
more
enervated
and
yet
they
always
appeared
in
a
costume
with
swords
dangling
at
their
sides
or
hats
cocked
after
a
military
fashion
on
their
heads
as
the
strength
of
samson
of
old
was
in
his
locks
so
the
degenerate
nobles
of
this
period
guarded
with
especial
care
these
masculine
ornaments
of
the
person
and
so
great
was
the
contagion
for
wigs
and
that
twelve
hundred
shops
existed
in
paris
to
furnish
this
aristocratic
luxury
the
muses
of
rome
in
the
days
of
her
decline
condescended
to
sing
on
the
arts
of
cookery
and
the
sublime
occupations
of
hunting
and
fishing
so
in
the
heroic
times
of
louis
xv
the
genius
of
france
soared
to
comprehend
the
mysteries
of
the
toilet
one
eminent
in
this
department
of
philosophical
wisdom
absolutely
published
a
bulky
volume
on
the
of
and
followed
it
so
highly
was
it
prized
by
a
no
less
ponderous
supplement
this
was
the
time
when
the
of
nobles
was
as
famous
as
their
toilets
and
when
recipes
for
different
dishes
were
only
equalled
in
variety
by
the
epigrams
of
ribald
poets
it
was
a
period
not
merely
of
degrading
follies
but
of
shameless
exposure
of
them
when
men
boasted
of
their
gallantries
and
women
joked
at
their
own
infirmities
and
when
hypocrisy
if
it
was
ever
added
to
their
other
vices
only
served
to
make
them
more
ridiculous
and
unnatural
the
rouge
with
which
they
painted
their
faces
and
the
powder
which
they
sprinkled
upon
their
hair
were
not
used
to
give
them
the
semblance
of
youthful
beauty
but
rather
to
impart
the
purple
hues
of
perpetual
drunkenness
such
as
rubens
gave
to
his
bacchanalian
deities
united
with
the
blanched
whiteness
of
premature
old
age
licentiousness
without
shame
drunkenness
without
rebuke
gambling
without
honor
and
frivolity
without
wit
characterized
alas
a
great
proportion
of
that
upper
class
who
disdained
the
occupations
and
sneered
at
the
virtues
of
industrial
life
but
these
dissipated
courtiers
had
a
model
constantly
before
their
eyes
whose
more
excessive
follies
it
were
difficult
to
rival
and
this
was
the
king
himself
whom
the
whole
nation
was
called
upon
to
obey
if
louis
xiv
was
a
nebuchadnezzar
unapproachable
from
pride
louis
xv
was
a
sardanapalus
in
effeminacy
and
insouciant
revelries
the
shameless
infamies
of
his
life
were
too
revolting
to
bear
more
than
a
passing
allusion
and
i
should
blush
to
tear
away
the
historic
veil
which
covers
up
his
vices
from
the
common
eye
i
shrink
from
showing
to
what
depths
humanity
can
sink
even
when
clothed
in
imperial
purple
and
seated
on
the
throne
of
state
the
countless
memoirs
of
that
wicked
age
have
however
exposed
to
the
indignant
eye
of
posterity
the
regal
debaucheries
of
versailles
and
the
pollutions
of
the
pare
aux
cerfs
that
infamous
seraglio
which
cost
the
state
one
hundred
millions
of
livres
at
the
lowest
estimate
and
this
was
but
a
part
of
the
great
system
of
waste
and
folly
five
hundred
millions
of
the
national
debt
were
incurred
for
expenses
too
ignominious
to
be
even
named
the
king
however
was
not
fond
of
pomp
it
was
fatiguing
for
him
to
bear
and
he
generally
shut
himself
from
the
sight
and
intercourse
of
any
but
convivial
friends
no
not
friends
for
to
absolute
monarchs
the
pleasures
of
friendship
are
denied
i
should
have
said
the
panderers
to
his
degrading
pleasures
never
did
the
papal
court
at
avignon
or
rome
even
in
the
worst
ages
of
mediaeval
darkness
witness
more
scandalous
enormities
than
those
which
disgraced
the
whole
reign
of
louis
either
in
the
days
of
his
minority
when
the
kingdom
was
governed
by
the
duke
of
orleans
or
in
his
latter
years
when
the
duke
of
choiseul
was
the
responsible
adviser
of
the
crown
the
palais
royal
the
palais
luxembourg
the
trianon
and
versailles
were
alternately
scenes
of
excesses
which
would
have
disgraced
the
reigns
of
the
most
degenerate
of
saracenic
caliphs
so
vile
was
the
court
that
a
celebrated
countess
one
day
said
at
a
public
festival
that
god
after
having
formed
man
took
the
mud
which
was
left
and
made
the
souls
of
princes
and
footmen
and
the
king
hated
business
as
much
as
he
hated
pomp
unlike
his
predecessor
he
left
everything
in
the
hands
of
his
servants
nothing
wearied
him
so
much
as
an
interview
with
a
minister
or
a
dispatch
from
a
general
in
the
society
of
his
mistresses
he
abnegated
his
duties
as
a
monarch
and
the
labors
of
his
life
were
employed
in
gratifying
their
resentments
and
humoring
their
caprices
their
complaints
were
more
potent
than
the
suggestions
of
ministers
or
the
remonstrances
of
judges
in
idle
frivolities
his
time
was
passed
neglectful
of
the
great
interests
which
were
intrusted
to
him
to
guard
and
the
only
attainment
of
which
he
was
proud
was
a
knack
of
making
tarts
and
with
which
he
frequently
regaled
his
visitors
and
yet
in
spite
of
these
ignoble
tastes
and
pursuits
the
king
was
by
no
means
deficient
in
natural
abilities
he
was
much
superior
to
even
louis
xiv
in
logical
acumen
and
sprightly
wit
he
was
an
agreeable
companion
and
could
appreciate
every
variety
of
talents
no
man
in
his
court
perceived
more
clearly
than
he
the
tendency
of
the
writings
of
philosophers
which
were
then
fermenting
the
germs
of
revolution
his
sagacity
kept
him
from
believing
in
voltaire
even
when
he
succeeded
in
deceiving
the
king
of
prussia
he
was
favorable
to
the
jesuits
though
he
banished
them
from
the
realm
perceiving
and
feeling
that
they
were
his
true
friends
and
the
best
supports
of
his
absolute
throne
and
yet
he
banished
them
from
his
kingdom
he
was
hostile
too
in
his
heart
to
the
very
philosophers
whom
he
invited
to
his
table
and
knew
that
they
sought
to
undermine
his
power
he
simply
had
not
the
moral
energy
to
carry
out
the
plans
of
that
despotism
to
which
he
was
devoted
sensuality
ever
robs
a
man
of
the
advantages
and
gifts
which
reason
gives
even
though
they
may
be
bestowed
to
an
extraordinary
degree
there
is
no
more
impotent
slavery
than
that
to
which
the
most
gifted
intellects
have
been
occasionally
doomed
is
sure
to
sap
every
element
of
moral
strength
and
to
take
away
from
genius
itself
all
power
except
to
sharpen
the
stings
of
louis
xv
was
not
insensible
to
the
dangers
which
menaced
his
throne
and
would
have
despoiled
the
parliament
of
the
right
of
remonstrance
would
have
imposed
on
the
jansenists
the
yoke
of
papal
supremacy
would
have
burned
the
books
of
the
philosophers
and
have
sent
their
authors
to
work
out
their
system
within
the
gloomy
dungeons
of
the
bastille
but
he
had
not
the
courage
nor
the
moral
strength
nor
the
power
of
will
he
was
enslaved
by
his
vices
and
by
those
who
pandered
to
them
and
he
could
not
act
either
the
king
or
the
man
seeing
the
dangers
but
feeling
his
impotence
he
affected
levity
and
exclaimed
to
his
courtiers
nous
le
a
prediction
which
only
uncommon
sagacity
could
have
prompted
immersed
however
in
unworthy
pleasures
he
gave
himself
not
much
concern
for
the
future
and
this
career
of
continued
to
the
last
even
after
satiety
and
had
deprived
the
appetites
of
the
power
to
please
his
latter
days
were
of
course
melancholy
and
his
miseries
resulted
as
much
from
the
perception
of
the
evils
to
come
as
from
the
failure
of
the
pleasures
of
sense
a
languor
from
which
he
was
with
difficulty
ever
roused
oppressed
his
life
deaf
incapable
of
being
amused
prematurely
worn
out
with
bodily
infirmities
hated
and
despised
by
the
whole
nation
he
dragged
out
his
year
and
died
of
the
which
he
caught
in
one
of
his
visits
to
the
pare
aux
cerfs
and
his
loathsome
remains
were
hastily
hurried
into
a
carriage
and
deposited
in
the
vaults
of
denis
as
however
during
this
long
reign
of
years
women
were
the
presiding
geniuses
of
the
court
and
the
virtual
directors
of
the
kingdom
i
can
not
give
a
faithful
portrait
of
the
times
without
some
allusion
at
least
to
that
woman
who
was
as
famous
in
her
day
as
madame
de
montespan
was
during
the
most
brilliant
period
of
the
reign
of
louis
xiv
i
single
out
madame
de
pompadour
from
the
crowd
of
erring
and
infirm
females
who
bartered
away
their
souls
for
the
temporary
honors
of
versailles
not
that
proud
peeress
whom
she
displaced
the
duchesse
de
châteauroux
not
that
and
infamous
character
by
whom
she
was
succeeded
du
barry
not
the
hundreds
of
other
women
who
were
partners
or
victims
of
guilty
pleasures
and
who
descended
unlamented
and
unhonored
to
their
ignominious
graves
are
here
to
be
alluded
to
but
madame
de
pompadour
is
a
great
historical
personage
because
with
her
are
identified
the
fall
of
the
jesuits
in
france
the
triumph
of
philosophers
and
economists
the
disgrace
of
ministers
and
the
most
outrageous
prodigality
which
ever
scandalized
a
nation
louis
xv
was
almost
wholly
directed
by
this
infamous
favorite
she
named
and
displaced
the
and
she
herself
received
annually
nearly
fifteen
hundred
thousand
livres
besides
hotels
palaces
and
estates
she
was
allowed
to
draw
bills
upon
the
treasury
without
specifying
the
service
and
those
who
incurred
her
displeasure
were
almost
sure
of
being
banished
from
the
court
and
kingdom
and
perhaps
sentenced
by
de
to
the
dreary
cells
of
the
bastille
she
virtually
had
the
appointment
of
the
prelates
of
the
church
and
of
the
generals
of
the
army
and
so
great
was
her
ascendency
that
all
persons
whatsoever
their
rank
found
it
expedient
to
pay
their
homage
to
her
even
montesquieu
praised
her
intellect
and
voltaire
her
beauty
and
maria
theresa
wrote
flattering
letters
to
her
the
prime
minister
was
her
tool
and
agent
since
royalty
itself
yielded
to
her
sway
even
the
proud
ladies
of
the
royal
family
condescended
to
flatter
and
to
honor
her
sprung
only
from
the
middle
ranks
of
society
she
yet
assumed
the
airs
of
a
princess
of
the
blood
from
her
earliest
years
long
before
she
was
admitted
to
the
court
it
had
been
the
dream
of
this
woman
to
seduce
the
king
her
father
was
butcher
to
the
invalides
and
she
spent
nearly
all
the
money
she
could
command
in
a
costly
present
to
a
great
duchess
the
princess
conti
in
order
to
be
presented
she
played
high
and
won
not
a
royal
heart
but
the
royal
fancy
her
dress
manners
and
extraordinary
beauty
increased
the
impression
she
had
once
before
made
at
a
and
after
the
levée
she
was
sent
for
and
became
virtually
the
minister
of
the
realm
she
was
unquestionably
a
woman
of
great
intellect
as
well
as
of
tact
and
beauty
and
even
manifested
a
sympathy
with
some
sorts
of
intellectual
excellence
she
was
the
patroness
of
artists
philosophers
and
poets
but
she
liked
those
best
who
were
distinguished
for
their
infidel
or
licentious
speculations
she
was
the
friend
of
those
economists
and
philosophers
who
sapped
the
foundations
of
the
social
system
an
imperious
and
insolent
hauteur
and
reckless
prodigality
were
her
most
marked
peculiarities
just
such
as
were
to
be
expected
in
an
unprincipled
woman
raised
suddenly
to
high
position
in
spite
of
her
power
she
did
not
escape
the
malignant
stings
of
envenomed
rivals
or
anonymous
satirists
she
was
rallied
on
the
baseness
of
her
origin
she
avenged
herself
by
making
common
cause
with
those
philosophers
who
overturned
the
ancient
order
she
was
both
mistress
and
politician
but
her
politics
and
alliances
subverted
the
throne
which
gave
her
all
her
glory
her
ascendency
of
course
rested
on
her
power
of
administering
to
the
tastes
and
pleasures
of
the
and
she
showed
genius
in
the
variety
of
amusements
which
she
invented
she
reigned
twenty
years
and
lost
her
empire
only
by
death
madame
de
maintenon
had
maintained
her
ascendency
over
louis
xiv
by
the
exercise
of
those
virtues
which
extorted
his
respect
but
madame
de
pompadour
by
the
faculty
of
charming
the
senses
it
was
by
her
that
versailles
was
enriched
with
the
most
precious
and
beautiful
of
its
countless
wonders
her
own
collection
of
pictures
cameos
antiques
crystals
porcelains
vases
gems
and
articles
of
was
esteemed
the
richest
and
most
valuable
in
the
kingdom
and
after
her
death
it
took
six
months
to
dispose
of
it
her
library
was
valued
at
more
than
a
million
of
francs
and
contained
some
of
the
rarest
manuscripts
and
most
curious
books
in
france
the
sums
however
which
she
spent
on
literary
curiosities
or
literary
men
were
small
compared
with
the
expenses
of
her
toilet
of
her
her
balls
and
her
palaces
and
all
these
expenses
were
open
as
the
day
in
the
eyes
of
a
nation
suffering
from
ruinous
taxation
from
famine
and
the
shame
of
unsuccessful
war
we
are
impressed
with
the
blind
and
suicidal
measures
which
all
those
connected
with
the
throne
instigated
or
encouraged
in
this
reign
from
the
king
to
the
most
infamous
of
his
mistresses
whoever
pretended
to
give
his
aid
to
the
monarchy
helped
to
subvert
it
by
the
very
measures
which
he
proposed
the
duke
of
orleans
when
he
patronized
law
gave
a
shock
to
the
whole
economical
system
of
the
old
regime
when
this
scotch
financier
said
to
the
powerful
aristocracy
around
him

only
to
you
the
means
of
circulation
beyond
this
it
belongs
to
the
country
he
announced
the
ruin
of
the
glebe
and
the
fall
of
feudal
prejudices
the
bankruptcies
which
followed
the
bursting
of
his
bubble
weakened
the
potent
charm
of
the
word
on
which
was
based
the
stability
of
the
throne
the
courtiers
when
they
blazed
in
jewels
in
embroidered
silks
and
satins
in
sumptuous
equipages
and
in
all
the
costly
ornaments
of
their
times
gave
employment
and
importance
to
a
host
of
shopkeepers
and
handicraftsmen
who
grew
rich
as
those
who
bought
of
them
grew
poor

wealth
of

to
these
times

fortunate

of

the
court
and
their
châteaux
and
parks
fell
into
the
hands
of
financiers
lawyers
and
merchants
who
taking
the
titles
of
their
new
estates
became
a
parvenu
aristocracy
which
excited
the
jealousy
of
the
old
and
divided
its
ranks
the
inferior
but
still
prosperous
class
the
shopkeepers
also
equally
advanced
in
intelligence
and
power
in
those
dark
and
dingy
backrooms
in
which
for
generations
their
ancestors
had
been
immured
they
now
discussed
their
rights
and
retailed
the
scandals
which
they
heard
they
read
the
sarcasms
of
the
poets
and
the
theories
of
the
new
philosophers
even
the
tranquillity
which
succeeded
inglorious
war
was
favorable
to
the
rise
of
the
middle
classes
and
the
revolution
was
as
much
the
product
of
the
discontent
engendered
by
social
improvements
as
of
the
frenzy
produced
by
hunger
and
despair
the
court
favored
the
improvements
of
paris
especially
those
designed
for
public
amusements
the
gardens
of
the
tuileries
were
embellished
the
champs
elysées
planted
with
trees
and
pictures
were
exhibited
in
the
grand
salon
of
the
louvre
the
theatre
français
the
royal
opera
the
opéra
comique
and
various
halls
for
balls
and
festivals
were
then
erected
those
fruitful
nurseries
of
future
clubs
those
poisoned
wells
of
popular
education
nor
were
charities
forgotten
with
the
building
of
the
pantheon
and
the
extension
of
the
boulevards
the
hôpital
des
allowed
mothers
unseen
and
unheard
to
bequeath
their
children
to
the
state
there
were
two
events
connected
with
the
reign
of
madame
de
pompadour
i
do
not
say
of
the
king
or
his
queen
or
his
ministers
for
philosophical
history
compels
us
to
confine
our
remarks
chiefly
to
great
controlling
agencies
whether
they
be
sovereigns
or
people
to
such
a
man
as
peter
the
great
when
one
speaks
of
a
nation
to
ideas
when
we
describe
popular
revolutions
which
had
a
great
influence
in
unsettling
the
kingdom
although
brought
about
in
no
inconsiderable
measure
by
this
unscrupulous
mistress
of
the
king
these
were
the
expulsion
of
the
jesuits
and
the
triumph
of
the
philosophers
in
regard
to
the
first
i
would
say
that
madame
de
pompadour
did
not
like
the
jesuits
not
because
they
were
the
enemies
of
liberal
principles
not
because
they
were
the
most
consistent
advocates
and
friends
of
despotism
in
all
its
forms
intellectual
religious
and
political
or
the
writers
of
casuistic
books
or
the
perverters
of
educational
instruction
or
boastful
missionaries
in
japan
and
china
or
cunning
intriguers
in
the
courts
of
princes
or
artful
confessors
of
the
great
or
uncompromising
despots
in
the
schools
but
because
they
interfered
with
her
ascendency
it
is
true
she
despised
their
sophistries
ridiculed
their
pretensions
and
detested
their
government
but
her
hostility
was
excited
not
because
they
aspired
like
her
like
the
philosophers
like
the
popes
like
the
press
in
our
times
to
a
participation
in
the
government
of
the
world
but
because
they
disputed
her
claims
as
one
of
the
powers
of
the
age
the
jesuits
were
scandalized
that
such
a
woman
should
usurp
the
reins
of
state
especially
when
they
perceived
that
she
mocked
and
defied
them
and
they
therefore
refused
to
pay
her
court
and
even
conspired
to
effect
her
overthrow
but
they
had
not
sufficiently
considered
the
potency
of
her
wrath
or
the
desperate
means
of
revenge
to
which
she
could
resort
nor
had
they
considered
those
other
influences
which
had
been
gradually
undermining
their
influence
even
the
sarcasms
of
the
jansenists
the
ridicule
of
the
philosophers
and
the
invectives
of
the
parliaments
only
one
or
two
favoring
circumstances
were
required
to
kindle
the
smothered
fires
of
hatred
into
a
blazing
flame
and
these
were
furnished
by
the
attempted
assassination
of
the
king
in
his
garden
at
versailles
by
damiens
the
fanatic
and
the
failure
of
la
valette
the
jesuit
banker
and
merchant
at
martinique
then
when
the
nation
was
astounded
by
their
political
conspiracies
and
their
commercial
gambling
to
say
nothing
of
the
perversion
of
their
truth
did
their
the
king
mistress
use
her
power
over
the
king
minister
her
own
creature
the
due
de
choiseul
to
decree
the
confiscation
of
their
goods
and
their
banishment
from
the
realm
nay
to
induce
the
pope
himself
in
conjunction
with
the
entreaties
of
all
the
bourbon
courts
of
europe
to
take
away
their
charter
and
suppress
their
order
the
fall
of
the
jesuits
has
been
already
alluded
to
in
another
volume
and
i
will
not
here
enlarge
on
that
singular
event
brought
about
by
the
malice
of
a
woman
whom
they
had
ventured
to
despise
it
is
easy
to
account
for
her
hatred
and
the
general
indignation
of
europe
it
is
not
difficult
to
understand
that
the
decline
of
that
great
body
in
those
virtues
which
originally
elevated
them
should
be
followed
by
animosities
which
would
undermine
their
power
we
can
see
why
their
moral
influence
should
pass
away
even
when
they
were
in
possession
of
dignities
and
honors
and
wealth
but
it
is
a
most
singular
fact
that
the
pope
himself
with
whose
interests
they
were
allied
their
natural
protector
the
head
of
the
hierarchy
which
they
so
constantly
defended
should
have
been
made
the
main
agent
in
their
temporary
humiliation
yet
clement
the
weak
and
timid
ganganelli
was
forced
to
this
suicidal
act
old
hildebrand
would
have
fought
like
a
lion
and
died
like
a
dog
rather
than
have
stooped
to
such
autocrats
as
the
bourbon
princes
a
judicial
and
mysterious
blindness
however
was
sent
upon
clement
his
strength
for
the
moment
was
paralyzed
and
he
signed
the
edict
which
dispersed
the
best
soldiers
that
sustained
the
interests
of
absolutism
in
europe
the
effect
of
the
suppression
of
the
order
in
france
was
both
good
and
ill
the
event
unquestionably
led
to
the
propagation
of
an
impious
philosophy
and
all
sorts
of
crude
opinions
and
theories
both
in
government
and
religion
in
the
schools
the
salons
and
the
pulpits
of
france
the
press
relieved
of
its
most
watchful
and
jealous
spies
teemed
with
pamphlets
and
books
of
the
most
licentious
character
the
good
and
evil
powers
were
both
unchained
and
suffered
to
go
free
about
the
land
and
to
do
what
work
they
could
there
are
many
who
feel
that
this
combat
is
necessary
for
the
full
development
of
human
strength
and
virtue
who
maintain
that
the
good
is
much
more
powerful
than
the
evil
in
any
age
of
moral
experiences
and
who
believe
that
angels
of
light
will
on
our
mundane
arena
prevail
over
angels
of
darkness
that
one
truth
is
stronger
than
one
thousand
lies
and
that
two
can
put
ten
thousand
to
flight
there
are
others
again
who
think
that
there
is
a
vitality
in
error
as
well
as
a
vitality
in
truth
as
proved
seemingly
by
the
prevalence
of
pagan
falsehoods
mohammedan
empires
and
papal
superstitions
but
to
whatever
party
clearness
of
judgment
belongs
one
thing
is
historically
certain
that
never
was
poor
human
nature
more
puzzled
by
false
guides
more
tempted
by
appetites
and
passions
more
enslaved
by
the
lust
of
the
eye
and
the
pride
of
life
than
during
the
latter
years
of
the
reign
of
louis
xv
never
was
there
a
period
or
a
country
in
christendom
more
frivolous
sceptical
irreligious
vain
conceited
and
superficial
than
during
the
reign
of
madame
de
pompadour
no
never
was
there
a
time
of
so
little
moral
elevation
among
the
great
mass
or
when
so
few
great
enterprises
were
projected
for
the
improvement
of
society
and
it
was
from
society
thus
disordered
inexperienced
and
godless
that
all
restraints
were
removed
from
the
ancient
and
venerated
guardians
of
youth
of
religion
and
of
literature
judge
what
must
have
been
the
effects
judge
between
these
opposing
theories
whether
it
were
better
to
have
the
institutions
of
society
guarded
by
selfish
ambitious
and
priests
or
to
have
the
of
vastly
preponderating
evil
influences
opened
upon
society
already
reeling
in
the
intoxication
of
the
senses
or
madly
raving
from
the
dethronement
of
reason
the
abnegation
of
religious
duties
and
the
extinction
of
the
light
of
faith
i
would
not
say
that
either
one
or
the
other
of
these
horrible
alternatives
is
necessary
or
probable
in
these
times
that
are
compelled
to
choose
between
them
or
that
we
ever
shall
be
compelled
but
simply
that
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
in
france
that
and
nation
there
existed
on
the
one
hand
a
most
execrable
spiritual
despotism
exercised
by
the
jesuits
and
on
the
other
a
boundless
ferment
of
destructive
and
revolutionary
principles
operating
on
a
people
generally
inclined
and
in
some
cases
abandoned
to
every
folly
and
vice
this
despotism
while
it
was
selfish
and
unwarrantable
still
had
in
view
the
guardianship
of
morals
and
literature
to
restrain
men
from
crimes
by
working
on
their
fears
but
society
while
it
sought
to
free
itself
from
hypocritical
and
oppressive
leaders
also
sought
to
remove
all
social
and
moral
restraints
and
to
plunge
into
reckless
and
dangerous
experiments
it
was
a
war
between
these
two
social
powers
between
unlawful
despotism
and
unsanctified
license
we
are
to
judge
not
which
was
the
better
but
which
was
the
worse
one
thing
however
is
certain
that
madame
de
pompadour
in
whom
was
centred
so
much
power
threw
her
influence
against
the
jesuits
and
in
favor
of
those
who
were
not
seeking
to
build
up
literature
and
morals
on
a
sure
and
healthy
foundation
but
rather
secretly
and
artfully
to
undermine
the
whole
intellectual
and
social
fabric
under
the
plea
of
liberty
and
human
rights
everybody
admits
that
the
writings
of
the
philosophers
gave
a
great
impulse
to
the
revolutionary
storm
which
afterwards
broke
out
ideas
are
ever
most
majestic
whether
they
are
good
or
evil
men
pass
away
but
principles
are
indestructible
and
of
perpetual
power
as
great
and
fearful
agencies
in
the
period
we
are
contemplating
they
are
worthy
of
our
notice
although
the
great
lights
which
adorned
the
literature
of
the
preceding
reign
no
longer
shone
such
geniuses
as
molière
boileau
racine
fénelon
bossuet
pascal
and
others
still
the
eighteenth
century
was
much
more
intellectual
and
inquiring
than
is
generally
supposed
under
louis
xiv
intellectual
independence
had
been
nearly
extinguished
his
reign
was
intellectually
and
spiritually
a
gloomy
calm
between
two
wonderful
periods
of
agitation
all
acquiesced
in
his
cold
heartless
rigid
rule
being
content
to
worship
him
as
a
deity
or
absorbed
in
the
excitements
of
his
wars
or
in
the
sorrows
and
burdens
which
those
wars
brought
in
their
train
but
under
louis
xv
the
people
began
to
meditate
on
the
causes
of
their
miseries
and
to
indulge
in
those
speculations
which
stimulated
their
discontents
or
appealed
to
their
intellectual
pride
not
from
la
rochelle
not
from
the
cells
of
port
royal
not
from
remonstrating
parliaments
did
the
voices
of
rebellion
come
the
genius
of
revolution
is
not
so
poor
as
to
be
obliged
to
make
use
of
the
same
class
of
instruments
or
repeat
the
same
experiments
in
changing
the
great
aspects
of
human
society
nor
will
she
allow
if
possible
those
who
guard
the
fortresses
which
she
wishes
to
batter
down
to
be
suspicious
of
her
combatants
her
warriors
are
ever
disguised
and
masked
or
else
concealed
within
some
form
of
a
protecting
deity
such
as
the
fabled
horse
which
the
doomed
trojans
received
within
their
walls
the
court
of
france
did
not
recognize
in
those
plausible
philosophers
whose
writings
had
such
a
charm
for
cultivated
intellect
the
miners
and
sappers
of
the
monarchy
only
one
class
of
royalists
understood
them
and
these
were
the
jesuits
whom
the
court
had
exiled
not
even
frederic
the
great
when
he
patronized
voltaire
was
aware
what
an
insidious
foe
was
domiciled
in
his
palace
with
all
his
sycophancy
of
rank
with
all
his
courtly
flattering
in
like
manner
when
the
grand
seigneurs
and
noble
dames
of
that
aristocratic
age
wept
over
the
sorrows
of
the
new
héloïse
or
craved
that
imaginary
state
of
untutored
innocence
which
rousseau
so
morbidly
described
or
admired
those
brilliant
generalizations
of
laws
which
montesquieu
had
penned
or
laughed
at
the
envenomed
ironies
of
voltaire
or
quoted
the
atheistic
doctrines
of
and
diderot
or
enthusiastically
discussed
the
economical
theories
of
quesnay
and
old
marquis
mirabeau
that
stern
father
of
him
who
both
in
his
intellectual
power
and
moral
deformity
was
alike
the
exponent
and
the
product
of
the
french
revolution
when
the
blinded
court
extolled
and
diffused
the
writings
of
these
new
apostles
of
human
rights
they
little
dreamed
that
they
would
be
still
more
admired
among
the
people
and
bring
forth
the
brissots
the
condoreets
the
marats
the
dantons
the
robespierres
of
the
next
generation
i
would
not
say
that
their
influence
was
wholly
bad
for
in
their
attacks
on
the
religion
and
institutions
of
their
country
they
subverted
monstrous
usurpations
but
whatever
was
their
ultimate
influence
they
were
doubtless
among
the
most
efficient
agents
in
overturning
the
throne
they
were
in
reality
the
secret
enemies
of
those
by
whom
they
were
patronized
and
honored
they
can
not
indeed
claim
the
merit
of
being
the
first
in
france
who
opened
the
eyes
of
the
nation
for
fénelon
had
taught
even
to
louis
in
his
immortal
the
duties
of
a
king
racine
in
his
had
shown
the
accursed
nature
of
irresponsible
despotism
molière
in
his
had
exposed
the
vices
of
priestly
hypocrisy
pascal
in
his
letters
had
revealed
the
wretched
sophistries
of
the
jesuits
bayle
even
in
his
dictionary
had
furnished
materials
for
future
sceptics
but
the
hostilities
of
all
these
men
were
united
in
voltaire
who
in
nearly
two
hundred
volumes
and
with
a
fecundity
of
genius
perfectly
amazing
and
unparalleled
in
poetry
in
history
in
criticism
yet
without
striking
originality
or
profound
speculations
astonished
and
delighted
his
generation
this
great
and
popular
writer
clothed
his
attacks
on
ecclesiastical
power
and
upon
christianity
itself
in
the
most
artistic
and
attractive
language
clear
simple
logical
without
pedantry
or
ostentation
and
enlivened
it
with
brilliant
sarcasms
appealing
to
popular
prejudices
and
never
soaring
beyond
popular
appreciation
never
did
a
man
have
such
popularity
never
did
a
famous
writer
leave
so
little
to
posterity
which
posterity
can
value
while
voltaire
was
indirectly
undermining
the
religious
convictions
of
mankind
the
encyclopedists
more
directly
attacked
the
sources
of
religious
belief
and
openly
denied
what
voltaire
had
doubted
but
neither
diderot
nor
made
such
shameless
assaults
as
the
apostles
of
a
still
more
atheistic
school
such
men
as
helvetius
and
the
baron
who
advocated
undisguised
selfishness
and
attributed
all
virtuous
impulses
to
animal
sensation
more
dangerous
still
than
these
ribald
blasphemers
were
those
sentimental
and
morbid
expounders
of
humanity
of
whom
rousseau
was
the
type
a
man
of
more
genius
perhaps
than
any
i
have
named
but
the
most
egotistical
of
that
whole
generation
of
dreamers
and
sensualists
who
prepared
the
way
for
revolution
he
was
the
father
of
those
agitating
ideas
which
spread
over
europe
and
reached
america
he
gave
utterance
in
his
eloquent
writings
to
those
mighty
liberty
fraternity
and
equality
that
equally
animated
mirabeau
robespierre
and
jefferson
but
the
writings
of
the
philosophers
will
again
be
alluded
to
in
the
next
lecture
as
among
the
efficient
causes
of
the
french
revolution
when
we
contemplate
those
financial
embarrassments
which
arose
from
half
a
century
of
almost
universal
war
and
those
awful
burdens
which
bent
to
the
dust
in
suffering
and
shame
the
whole
people
of
a
great
country
when
we
consider
the
absurd
and
wicked
distinctions
which
separated
man
from
man
and
the
settled
hostility
of
the
clergy
to
all
means
of
intellectual
and
social
improvement
when
we
remember
the
unparalleled
vices
of
a
licentious
court
the
ignominious
negligence
of
the
government
to
the
happiness
and
wants
of
those
whom
it
was
its
duty
to
protect
and
the
shameless
insults
which
an
infamous
woman
was
allowed
to
heap
upon
the
nation
and
then
when
we
bear
in
mind
all
the
elements
of
disgust
of
discontent
of
innovation
and
of
reckless
and
impious
defiance
can
we
wonder

peter
the
great
his
services
to
russia
if
i
were
called
upon
to
name
the
man
who
since
charlemagne
has
rendered
the
greatest
services
to
his
country
i
should
select
peter
the
great
i
do
not
say
that
he
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
characters
that
has
shone
in
the
noble
constellations
of
illustrious
benefactors
whom
europe
has
produced
far
otherwise
his
career
is
not
so
interesting
to
us
as
that
of
hildebrand
or
elizabeth
or
cromwell
or
richelieu
or
gustavus
adolphus
or
william
or
louis
or
frederic
or
others
i
might
mention
i
have
simply
to
show
an
enlightened
barbarian
toiling
for
civilization
a
sort
of
hercules
cleansing
augean
stables
and
killing
nemean
lions
a
man
whose
labors
were
prodigious
a
very
extraordinary
man
stained
by
crimes
and
cruelties
yet
laboring
with
a
sort
of
inspired
enthusiasm
to
raise
his
country
from
an
abyss
of
ignorance
and
brutality
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
a
more
despot
and
yet
a
more
patriotic
sovereign
to
me
he
looms
up
even
more
than
richelieu
as
an
instrument
of
divine
providence
his
character
appears
in
a
double
light
as
benefactor
and
as
tyrant
in
order
to
carry
out
ends
which
he
deemed
useful
to
his
country
and
which
we
are
constrained
to
admit
did
wonderfully
contribute
to
its
elevation
and
political
importance
peter
the
great
entered
upon
his
inheritance
as
absolute
sovereign
of
russia
when
it
was
an
inland
and
even
isolated
state
hemmed
in
and
girt
around
by
hostile
powers
without
access
to
seas
a
vast
country
indeed
but
without
a
regular
standing
army
on
which
he
could
rely
or
even
a
navy
however
small
this
country
was
more
asiatic
than
european
occupied
by
mongrel
tribes
living
amid
snow
and
morasses
and
forests
without
education
or
knowledge
of
european
arts
he
left
this
country
after
a
turbulent
reign
with
seaports
on
the
baltic
and
the
black
seas
with
a
large
and
powerfully
disciplined
army
partially
redeemed
from
barbarism
no
longer
isolated
or
unimportant
but
a
political
power
which
the
nations
had
cause
to
fear
and
which
from
the
policy
he
bequeathed
has
been
increasing
in
resources
from
his
time
to
ours
russia
stands
out
as
a
power
with
the
largest
army
in
the
world
a
menace
to
germany
a
rival
of
great
britain
in
the
extension
of
conquests
to
the
east
threatening
to
seize
turkey
and
control
the
black
sea
and
even
to
take
possession
of
oriental
empires
which
extend
to
the
pacific
ocean
nobody
doubts
or
questions
that
the
rise
of
russia
to
its
present
proud
and
threatening
position
is
chiefly
owing
to
the
genius
and
policy
of
peter
the
great
peter
was
a
descendant
of
a
patriarch
of
the
greek
church
in
russia
whose
name
was
romanoff
and
who
was
his
his
grandfather
married
a
near
relative
of
the
czar
and
succeeded
him
by
election
his
father
alexis
was
an
able
man
and
made
war
on
the
turks
peter
was
a
child
when
his
father
died
and
his
theodore
became
the
czar
but
theodore
reigned
only
a
short
time
and
peter
succeeded
him
at
the
age
of
ten
the
government
remaining
in
the
hands
of
his
sophia
a
woman
of
great
ability
and
intelligence
but
intriguing
and
unscrupulous
she
was
aided
by
prince
galitzin
the
ablest
statesman
of
russia
who
held
the
great
office
of
chancellor
this
prince
it
would
seem
with
the
aid
of
the
general
of
the
streltzi
the
ancient
imperial
guards
and
the
cabals
of
sophia
conspired
against
the
life
of
peter
then
seventeen
years
of
age
inasmuch
as
he
began
to
manifest
extraordinary
abilities
and
a
will
of
his
own
but
the
young
hercules
strangled
the
serpent
sent
galitzin
to
siberia
confined
his
sister
sophia
in
a
convent
for
the
rest
of
her
days
and
assumed
the
reins
of
government
himself
although
a
mere
youth
in
conjunction
with
his
brother
john
that
which
characterized
him
was
a
remarkable
precocity
greater
than
that
of
anybody
of
whom
i
have
read
at
eighteen
he
was
a
man
with
a
fine
physical
development
and
great
beauty
of
form
and
entered
upon
absolute
and
undisputed
power
as
czar
of
muscovy
in
the
years
of
the
regency
when
the
government
was
in
the
hands
of
his
he
did
not
give
promise
of
those
remarkable
abilities
and
that
life
of
which
afterwards
marked
his
career
in
his
earlier
youth
he
had
been
surrounded
with
seductive
pleasures
as
louis
xiv
had
been
by
the
with
a
view
to
him
not
oppose
him
and
he
yielded
to
these
pleasures
and
is
said
to
have
been
a
very
dissipated
young
man
with
his
education
neglected
but
he
no
sooner
got
rid
of
his
sister
and
her
adviser
galitzin
than
he
seemed
to
comprehend
at
once
for
what
he
was
raised
up
the
vast
responsibilities
of
his
position
pressed
upon
his
mind
to
civilize
his
country
to
make
it
politically
powerful
to
raise
it
in
the
scale
of
nations
to
labor
for
its
good
rather
than
for
his
own
private
pleasure
seems
to
have
animated
his
existence
and
this
aim
he
pursued
from
first
to
last
like
a
giant
of
destiny
without
any
regard
to
losses
or
humiliations
or
defeats
or
obstacles
chance
or
destiny
or
providence
threw
in
his
path
the
very
person
whom
he
needed
as
a
teacher
and
a
mentor
a
young
gentleman
from
geneva
whom
historians
love
to
call
an
adventurer
but
who
occupied
the
post
of
private
secretary
to
the
danish
minister
aristocratic
pedants
call
everybody
an
adventurer
who
makes
his
fortune
by
his
genius
and
his
accomplishments
they
called
thomas
becket
an
adventurer
in
the
time
of
henry
and
thomas
cromwell
in
the
reign
of
henry
viii
the
young
secretary
to
the
danish
minister
seems
to
have
been
a
man
of
remarkable
ability
insight
and
powers
of
fascination
based
on
his
intelligence
and
on
knowledge
acquired
in
the
first
instance
in
a
mercantile
house
as
was
the
success
of
thomas
cromwell
and
alexander
hamilton
it
was
from
this
young
man
whose
name
was
lefort
whom
peter
casually
met
at
dinner
at
the
house
of
the
danish
envoy
that
he
was
made
acquainted
with
the
superior
discipline
of
the
troops
of
france
and
germany
and
the
mercantile
greatness
of
holland
and
england
the
two
things
which
he
was
most
anxious
to
understand
since
as
he
believed
on
the
discipline
of
an
army
and
the
efficiency
of
a
navy
the
political
greatness
of
his
country
must
rest
a
disciplined
army
would
render
secure
the
throne
of
absolutism
and
an
efficient
navy
would
open
and
protect
his
ports
for
the
encouragement
of
commerce
one
of
the
great
sources
of
national
wealth
without
commerce
and
free
intercourse
with
other
countries
no
nation
could
get
money
and
without
money
even
an
absolute
monarch
could
not
reign
as
he
would
so
these
two
young
men
took
counsel
together
and
the
conviction
was
settled
in
the
minds
of
each
that
there
could
be
no
military
discipline
and
no
efficient
military
power
so
long
as
the
streltzi
those
antiquated
and
turbulent
old
guards
could
depose
and
set
up
monarchs
they
settled
it
and
with
the
enthusiasm
of
young
men
that
before
they
could
get
rid
of
these
dangerous
troops
only
fit
for
oriental
or
barbaric
fighting
they
must
create
a
regiment
after
their
own
liking
large
enough
to
form
the
nucleus
of
a
real
european
army
and
yet
not
large
enough
to
excite
jealousy
for
sophia
was
then
still
regent
and
the
youthful
peter
was
supposed
to
be
merely
amusing
himself
the
swiss
adventurer
one
of
the
most
enlightened
men
of
his
age
and
full
of
genius
became
colonel
of
this
regiment
and
peter
not
thinking
he
knew
anything
about
true
military
tactics
and
wishing
to
learn
and
not
too
proud
to
learn
being
born
with
disdain
of
conventionalities
and
precedents
entered
the
regiment
as
drummer
in
sight
of
his
own
subjects
who
perhaps
looked
upon
the
act
as
a
royal
freak
even
as
nero
practised
fiddling
and
commodus
archery
before
the
roman
people
from
drummer
he
rose
to
the
rank
of
corporal
and
from
corporal
to
sergeant
and
so
on
through
all
the
grades
that
is
the
way
peter
began
as
all
great
men
begin
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
for
great
as
it
was
to
be
born
a
prince
it
was
greater
to
learn
how
to
be
a
general
in
this
fantastic
conduct
we
see
three
things
a
remarkable
sagacity
in
detecting
the
genius
of
lefort
a
masterly
power
over
his
own
will
and
a
willingness
to
learn
anything
from
anybody
able
and
willing
to
teach
him
even
as
a
rich
and
bright
young
lady
now
and
then
when
about
to
assume
the
superintendence
of
a
great
household
condescends
to
study
some
of
the
details
of
a
kitchen
those
domestic
arts
on
which
depend
something
of
that
happiness
which
is
the
end
and
aim
of
married
life
many
a
promising
domestic
hearth
is
wrecked
such
is
the
weakness
of
human
nature
by
the
ignorance
or
disdain
of
humble
acquirements
or
what
seem
humble
to
fortunate
women
and
yet
which
are
really
steps
to
a
proud
ascendency
we
trace
the
ambition
of
peter
for
commercial
and
maritime
greatness
also
to
a
very
humble
beginning
whether
it
was
a
youthful
sport
subsequently
directed
into
a
great
enterprise
or
the
plodding
intention
to
create
a
navy
and
open
seaports
under
his
own
superintendence
it
would
be
difficult
to
settle
we
may
call
this
beginning
a
decree
of
providence
an
inspiration
of
genius
or
a
passion
for
sailing
a
boat
the
end
was
the
same
as
it
came
about
the
entrance
of
russia
into
the
family
of
european
states
it
would
seem
that
one
day
by
chance
peter
attention
was
directed
to
a
little
boat
laid
up
on
the
banks
of
a
canal
which
ran
through
his
it
had
been
built
by
a
dutch
carpenter
for
the
amusement
of
his
father
this
boat
had
a
keel
a
new
thing
to
him
and
attracted
his
curiosity
lefort
explained
to
him
that
it
was
constructed
to
sail
against
the
wind
so
the
carpenter
was
summoned
with
orders
to
rig
the
boat
and
sail
it
on
the
moskva
the
river
which
runs
through
moscow
peter
was
delighted
and
he
soon
learned
to
manage
it
himself
then
a
yacht
was
built
manned
by
two
men
and
it
was
the
delight
of
peter
to
take
the
helm
himself
shortly
five
other
vessels
were
built
to
navigate
lake
peipus
and
the
ambition
of
peter
was
not
satisfied
until
a
still
larger
vessel
was
procured
at
archangel
in
which
he
sailed
on
a
cruise
upon
the
frozen
ocean
his
taste
for
navigation
became
a
passion
and
once
again
he
embarked
on
the
frozen
ocean
in
a
ship
determined
to
go
through
all
the
gradations
of
a
sailor
life
as
he
began
as
drummer
in
lefort
regiment
so
he
first
served
as
a
common
drudge
who
swept
the
cabin
in
a
dutch
vessel
then
he
rose
to
the
rank
of
a
servant
who
kept
up
the
fire
and
lighted
the
pipe
of
the
dutch
skipper
then
he
was
advanced
to
the
duty
of
unfurling
and
furling
the
sails
and
so
on
until
he
had
mastered
the
details
of
a
sailor
life
why
did
he
condescend
to
these
mean
details
the
ambition
was
planted
in
him
to
build
a
navy
under
his
own
superintendence
wherefore
a
navy
when
he
had
no
seaports
but
he
meant
to
have
seaports
he
especially
needed
a
fleet
on
the
volga
to
keep
the
turks
and
tartars
in
awe
and
another
in
the
gulf
of
finland
to
protect
his
territories
from
the
swedes
we
shall
see
how
subsequently
and
in
due
time
he
conquered
the
baltic
from
the
swedes
and
the
euxine
from
the
turks
he
did
not
seem
to
have
an
ambition
for
indefinite
territorial
aggrandizement
but
simply
to
extend
his
empire
to
these
seas
for
the
purpose
of
having
a
free
egress
and
ingress
to
it
by
water
he
could
not
europeanize
his
empire
without
seaports
for
unless
russia
had
these
she
would
remain
a
barbarous
country
a
vast
wallachia
or
moldavia
the
expediency
and
the
necessity
of
these
ports
were
most
obvious
but
how
was
he
to
get
them
only
by
war
aggressive
war
he
would
seize
what
he
wanted
since
he
could
attain
his
end
in
no
other
way
now
i
do
not
propose
to
whitewash
this
enlightened
but
unscrupulous
robber
on
no
recognized
principles
of
morality
can
he
be
defended
any
more
than
can
louis
xiv
for
the
invasion
of
flanders
or
frederic
ii
for
the
seizure
of
silesia
he
first
resolved
to
seize
azof
the
main
port
on
the
little
sea
of
that
name
which
opens
out
into
the
black
sea
and
which
belonged
to
the
turks
it
was
undoubted
robbery
but
its
possession
would
be
an
immense
advantage
to
russia
of
course
that
seizure
could
not
be
justified
either
by
the
laws
of
god
or
the
laws
of
nations
thou
shalt
not
steal
is
an
eternally
binding
law
for
nations
and
for
individuals
peter
knew
that
he
had
no
right
to
this
important
city
but
at
the
same
time
he
knew
that
its
possession
would
benefit
russia
so
we
are
compelled
to
view
this
monarch
as
a
robber
taking
what
was
not
his
as
ahab
seized
naboth
vineyard
but
taking
it
for
the
benefit
of
his
country
which
ahab
did
not
he
knew
it
was
a
political
crime
but
a
crime
to
advance
the
civilization
of
his
empire
the
only
great
idea
of
his
life
was
the
welfare
of
his
country
by
any
means
for
his
country
he
would
sacrifice
his
character
and
public
morality
some
might
call
this
an
exalted
patriotism
i
call
it
unmitigated
jesuitism
which
seems
to
have
been
the
creed
of
politicians
and
even
of
statesmen
for
the
last
three
hundred
years
all
that
peter
thought
of
was
he
cared
nothing
for
the
i
wonder
why
carlyle
or
froude
has
not
bolstered
up
and
defended
this
great
hyperborean
giant
for
doing
evil
that
good
may
come
casuistry
is
in
their
line
the
defence
of
scoundrels
seems
to
be
their
vocation
well
then
bear
in
mind
that
peter
feeling
that
he
must
have
azof
for
the
good
of
russia
irrespective
of
right
or
wrong
went
straight
forward
to
his
end
of
course
he
knew
he
must
have
a
fight
with
turkey
to
gain
this
prize
and
he
prepared
for
such
a
fight
turkey
was
not
then
what
it
is
now
ripe
fruit
to
be
gobbled
up
by
russia
when
the
rest
of
europe
permits
it
but
turkey
then
was
a
great
power
at
that
very
time
two
hundred
thousand
turks
were
besieging
vienna
which
would
have
fallen
but
for
john
sobieski
but
obstacles
were
nothing
to
peter
they
were
simply
things
to
be
surmounted
at
any
sacrifice
of
time
or
money
or
men
so
with
the
ships
he
had
built
he
sailed
down
the
river
don
and
attacked
azof
he
was
foiled
not
beaten
he
never
seemed
to
know
when
he
was
beaten
and
he
never
seemed
to
care
that
hard
iron
man
marched
to
his
object
like
a
destiny
what
he
had
to
do
was
to
take
azof
against
an
army
of
turks
so
having
failed
in
the
first
campaign
through
the
treachery
of
one
jacobs
who
had
been
employed
in
the
artillery
he
tried
it
again
the
next
year
and
succeeded
his
army
being
commanded
by
general
gordon
a
scotchman
while
he
himself
served
only
as
ensign
or
lieutenant
this
port
was
the
key
of
palus
maeotis
and
opened
to
him
the
black
sea
on
which
he
resolved
to
establish
a
navy
he
had
now
an
army
modelled
after
the
european
fashion
according
to
the
suggestions
of
lefort
whose
regiment
became
the
model
of
other
regiments
five
thousand
men
were
trained
and
commanded
by
general
gordon
lefort
raised
another
corps
of
twelve
thousand
from
the
streltzi
chiefly
these
were
the
forces
in
conjunction
with
the
navy
with
which
he
reduced
azof
he
now
returns
to
moscow
and
receives
the
congratulations
of
the
boyars
or
nobles
that
class
who
owned
the
landed
property
of
russia
and
cultivated
it
by
serfs
he
made
heavy
contributions
on
these
nobles
and
also
on
the
clergy
for
it
takes
money
to
carry
on
a
war
and
money
he
must
have
somehow
these
forced
contributions
and
the
changes
which
were
made
in
the
army
were
not
beheld
with
complacency
the
old
guard
the
streltzi
were
particularly
disgusted
the
various
innovations
were
very
unpopular
especially
those
made
in
reference
to
the
dress
of
the
new
soldiers
the
result
of
all
these
innovations
and
discontents
was
a
conspiracy
to
take
his
life
which
however
was
seasonably
detected
and
severely
punished
an
extraordinary
purpose
now
seized
the
mind
of
the
czar
which
was
to
travel
in
the
various
countries
of
europe
and
learn
something
more
especially
about
on
which
his
heart
was
set
he
also
wished
to
study
laws
institutions
sciences
and
arts
and
in
order
to
study
them
effectually
he
resolved
to
travel
incognito
hitherto
he
had
not
been
represented
in
the
european
courts
so
he
appointed
an
embassy
of
extraordinary
magnificence
to
proceed
in
the
first
instance
to
holland
then
the
foremost
mercantile
state
of
europe
the
retinue
consisted
of
four
secretaries
at
the
head
of
whom
was
lefort
twelve
nobles
fifty
guards
and
other
persons
altogether
to
the
number
of
two
hundred
as
they
travelled
through
prussia
they
were
received
with
great
distinction
and
the
whole
journey
seems
to
have
been
a
bacchanalian
progress
there
were
nothing
and
banquets
to
his
honor
and
the
russians
proved
to
have
great
capacity
for
drinking
at
königsberg
he
left
his
embassy
to
their
revels
and
proceeded
rapidly
and
privately
to
holland
hired
a
small
room
kitchen
and
garret
for
lodgings
and
established
himself
as
journeyman
carpenter
with
a
resolute
determination
to
learn
the
trade
of
a
he
dressed
like
a
common
carpenter
and
lived
like
one
with
great
simplicity
when
he
was
not
at
work
in
the
with
his
broad
axe
he
amused
himself
by
sailing
a
yacht
dressed
like
a
dutch
skipper
with
a
red
jacket
and
white
trousers
he
was
a
marked
personage
even
had
it
not
been
known
that
he
was
the
czar
a
tall
robust
active
man
of
with
a
fierce
look
and
curling
brown
locks
free
from
all
restraint
seeing
but
little
of
the
ambassadors
who
had
followed
him
and
passing
his
time
with
and
merchants
and
adhering
rigidly
to
all
the
regulations
of
the
he
spent
nine
months
in
this
way
at
hard
labor
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
had
mastered
the
art
of
in
all
its
details
had
acquired
the
dutch
language
and
had
seen
what
was
worth
seeing
of
amsterdam
showing
an
unbounded
curiosity
and
indefatigable
zeal
frequenting
the
markets
and
the
shops
attending
lectures
in
anatomy
and
surgery
learning
even
how
to
draw
teeth
visiting
museums
and
manufactories
holding
intercourse
with
learned
men
and
making
considerable
proficiency
in
civil
engineering
and
the
science
of
fortification
nothing
escaped
his
eager
inquiries
wat
is
dat
was
his
perpetual
exclamation
he
devoured
every
morsel
of
knowledge
with
unexampled
voracity
never
was
seen
a
man
on
this
earth
with
a
more
devouring
appetite
for
knowledge
of
every
kind
storing
up
in
his
mind
everything
he
saw
with
a
view
of
introducing
improvements
into
russia
to
see
this
barbaric
emperor
thus
going
to
school
and
working
with
his
own
hands
insensible
to
heat
and
cold
and
weariness
with
the
single
aim
of
benefiting
his
countrymen
when
he
should
return
is
to
me
one
of
the
most
wonderful
sights
of
history
his
chosen
companion
in
these
labors
and
visits
and
pleasures
was
also
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
of
his
age
his
name
was
mentchikof
originally
a
seller
of
pies
in
the
streets
of
moscow
who
attracted
by
his
beauty
and
brightness
the
attention
of
general
lefort
and
was
made
a
page
in
his
household
and
was
as
such
made
known
to
the
czar
who
took
a
fancy
to
him
and
soon
detected
his
great
talents
so
that
he
rose
as
rapidly
as
joseph
did
in
the
court
of
pharaoh
and
became
general
governor
prince
regent
with
almost
autocratic
power
the
whole
subsequent
reign
of
peter
and
of
his
successor
became
identified
with
prince
mentchikof
who
was
prime
minister
and
grand
vizier
and
who
forwarded
all
the
schemes
of
his
master
with
consummate
ability
after
leaving
holland
peter
accepted
an
invitation
of
william
iii
to
visit
england
and
thither
he
went
with
his
embassy
in
royal
ships
yet
still
affecting
to
travel
as
a
private
gentleman
he
would
accept
no
honors
no
public
receptions
no
state
banquets
he
came
to
england
not
to
receive
honors
but
to
add
to
his
knowledge
and
he
wished
to
remain
unfettered
in
his
in
england
the
same
insatiable
curiosity
marked
him
as
in
holland
he
visits
the
and
goes
to
the
theatre
and
the
opera
and
holds
interviews
with
quakers
and
attends
their
meetings
as
well
as
the
churches
of
the
establishment
the
of
nobles
with
their
parks
and
gardens
and
hedges
filled
him
with
admiration
he
was
also
greatly
struck
with
greenwich
hospital
which
looked
to
him
like
a
royal
palace
as
it
was
originally
and
he
greatly
wondered
that
the
old
seedy
and
frowsy
pensioners
should
be
lodged
so
magnificently
the
courts
of
westminster
surprised
him
why
said
he
in
reference
to
the
legal
gentlemen
in
wigs
and
gowns
i
have
but
two
lawyers
in
my
dominions
and
one
of
them
i
mean
to
hang
as
soon
as
i
return
but
while
he
visited
everything
generally
in
a
quiet
way
avoiding
display
and
publicity
he
was
most
interested
in
mechanical
inventions
and
the
and
mock
naval
combats
it
would
seem
that
his
private
life
was
simple
although
he
is
accused
of
eating
voraciously
and
of
drinking
great
quantities
of
brandy
and
sack
if
this
be
true
he
certainly
reformed
his
habits
and
learned
to
govern
himself
for
he
was
very
temperate
in
his
latter
days
men
who
are
very
active
and
perform
herculean
labors
do
not
generally
belong
to
the
class
of
gluttons
or
drunkards
i
have
read
of
but
few
great
generals
like
caesar
or
charlemagne
or
william
or
gustavus
adolphus
or
marlborough
or
cromwell
or
turenne
or
wellington
or
napoleon
who
were
not
temperate
in
their
habits
after
leaving
england
the
czar
repaired
to
vienna
holland
sending
to
russia
five
hundred
persons
whom
he
took
in
his
employ
navy
captains
pilots
surgeons
gunners
blacksmiths
and
various
other
mechanics
having
an
eye
to
the
industrial
development
of
his
country
which
was
certainly
better
than
driving
out
of
his
kingdom
four
hundred
thousand
honest
people
as
louis
xiv
did
because
they
were
protestants
but
peter
did
not
tarry
long
in
vienna
whose
military
establishments
he
came
to
study
being
compelled
to
return
hastily
to
moscow
to
suppress
a
rebellion
he
returned
a
much
wiser
man
i
doubt
if
any
person
ever
was
more
improved
than
he
by
his
travels
what
an
example
to
tourists
in
these
times
all
travelling
except
explorations
is
a
dissipation
and
waste
of
time
unless
is
the
main
object
is
the
greatest
vanity
on
this
earth
for
he
who
pleasure
never
finds
it
but
it
comes
when
it
is
a
minor
consideration
the
apprenticeship
of
peter
is
now
completed
and
he
enters
more
seriously
upon
those
great
labors
which
have
given
him
an
immortality
i
am
compelled
to
be
brief
in
stating
them
the
first
thing
he
did
on
his
return
was
finally
to
crush
the
streltzi
who
fomented
treasons
and
were
hostile
to
reform
he
had
wisely
left
general
gordon
at
moscow
with
six
thousand
soldiers
disciplined
after
the
european
fashion
in
abolishing
the
turbulent
and
prejudicial
streltzi
he
is
accused
of
great
cruelties
he
summarily
executed
or
imprisoned
some
four
thousand
of
them
caught
in
acts
of
treason
and
rebellion
and
drafted
the
rest
into
distant
regiments
he
may
have
been
unnecessarily
cruel
as
critics
have
accused
oliver
cromwell
of
being
in
his
treatment
of
the
irish
but
cruel
or
not
he
got
rid
of
troops
he
could
not
trust
and
organized
soldiers
whom
he
could
for
he
must
have
tools
to
work
with
if
he
would
do
his
work
i
neither
praise
nor
condemn
his
mode
of
working
i
seek
to
show
how
he
performed
his
task
after
disbanding
rebellious
soldiers
he
sought
to
make
his
army
more
efficient
by
changing
the
dress
of
the
entire
army
he
did
away
with
the
long
coat
reaching
to
the
heels
something
like
that
which
ladies
wear
in
rainy
days
and
the
drawers
not
unlike
petticoats
and
the
long
bushy
beards
he
found
more
difficulty
in
making
this
reform
than
in
taking
azof
although
aided
by
mentchikof
his
favorite
and
prime
minister
he
was
not
content
with
cutting
off
the
beards
of
the
soldiers
and
shortening
their
coats
he
wished
to
make
private
citizens
do
the
same
but
the
uproar
and
discontent
were
so
great
that
he
was
obliged
to
compromise
the
matter
and
allow
the
citizens
to
wear
their
beards
and
robes
on
condition
of
a
heavy
tax
graded
on
ability
to
pay
it
the
only
class
he
exempted
from
the
tax
were
the
clergy
and
the
serfs
among
other
reforms
he
changed
the
calendar
making
the
year
to
begin
with
january
and
abolished
the
old
laws
with
reference
to
marriage
by
which
young
people
had
no
power
of
choice
but
he
decreed
that
no
marriage
should
take
place
unless
an
intimacy
had
existed
between
the
parties
for
at
least
six
months
he
instituted
balls
and
assemblies
to
soften
the
manners
of
the
people
he
encouraged
the
theatre
protected
science
invited
eminent
men
to
settle
in
russia
improved
the
courts
of
justice
established
posts
and
boards
of
trade
a
vigorous
police
hospitals
and
he
imported
saxony
sheep
erected
linen
woollen
and
paper
mills
dug
canals
suppressed
gambling
and
fostered
industry
and
art
he
aimed
to
do
for
russia
what
richelieu
and
colbert
did
for
france
the
greatest
opposition
to
his
reforms
came
from
the
clergy
with
the
patriarch
at
their
head
a
personage
of
great
dignity
and
power
ruling
an
in
peter
had
no
hostility
to
the
greek
religion
nor
to
the
clergy
like
charlemagne
he
was
himself
descended
from
an
ecclesiastical
family
but
finding
the
clergy
hostile
to
civil
and
social
reforms
he
sought
to
change
the
organization
of
the
church
itself
he
did
not
interfere
with
doctrines
nor
discipline
nor
rites
nor
forms
of
worship
but
he
unseated
the
patriarch
and
appointed
instead
a
consistory
the
members
of
which
were
nominated
by
himself
like
henry
he
virtually
made
himself
the
head
of
the
church
that
is
the
supreme
direction
of
ecclesiastical
affairs
was
given
to
those
whom
he
controlled
and
not
to
the
patriarch
whose
power
had
been
supreme
in
religious
matters
more
than
papal
almost
druidical
in
former
reigns
the
patriarch
had
the
power
of
life
and
death
in
his
own
tribunals
and
when
he
rode
to
church
on
palm
sunday
in
his
emblazoned
robes
the
czar
walked
uncovered
at
his
side
and
held
the
bridle
of
his
mule
it
is
a
mark
of
the
extraordinary
power
of
peter
that
he
was
enabled
to
abolish
this
great
dignity
without
a
revolution
or
bloodshed
and
he
not
only
abolished
the
patriarchal
dignity
but
he
seized
the
revenues
of
the
patriarch
taxed
the
clergy
and
partially
suppressed
monasteries
decreeing
that
no
one
should
enter
them
under
fifty
years
of
age
yea
he
even
decreed
universal
toleration
of
religion
except
to
the
jesuits
whom
he
hated
as
did
william
iii
and
frederic
ii
he
caused
the
bible
to
be
translated
into
the
slavonic
language
and
freely
circulated
it
and
he
prosecuted
these
reforms
while
he
was
meditating
or
was
engaged
in
great
military
enterprises
i
approach
now
the
great
external
event
of
peter
life
his
war
with
charles
brought
about
in
part
by
his
eagerness
to
get
a
seaport
on
the
baltic
and
in
part
by
the
mad
ambition
of
the
swedish
king
determined
to
play
the
part
of
alexander
the
aggressive
party
in
this
war
however
was
peter
he
was
resolved
to
take
part
of
the
swedish
territories
for
mercantile
and
maritime
purposes
so
he
invaded
sweden
with
sixty
thousand
men
charles
whose
military
genius
was
not
appreciated
by
the
czar
had
only
eight
thousand
troops
to
oppose
the
invasion
but
they
were
veterans
and
fought
on
the
defensive
and
had
right
on
their
side
this
latter
is
a
greater
thing
in
war
than
is
generally
supposed
for
although
war
is
in
our
own
times
a
mechanism
in
a
great
measure
still
moral
considerations
underlie
even
physical
forces
and
give
a
sort
of
courage
which
is
hard
to
resist
the
result
of
this
invasion
was
the
battle
of
narva
when
peter
was
disgracefully
beaten
as
he
ought
to
have
been
but
he
bore
his
defeat
complacently
he
is
reported
as
saying
that
he
knew
the
swedes
would
have
the
advantage
at
first
but
that
they
would
teach
him
how
to
beat
them
at
last
i
doubt
this
i
do
not
believe
a
general
ever
went
into
battle
with
a
vastly
overwhelming
force
when
he
did
not
expect
victory
but
the
great
victory
won
by
charles
a
mere
stripling
king
scarcely
nineteen
turned
his
head
never
was
there
a
more
intoxicated
hero
he
turned
his
victorious
army
upon
poland
dethroned
the
king
invaded
saxony
and
prepared
to
invade
russia
with
an
army
of
eighty
thousand
troops
his
cool
adversary
who
since
his
defeat
at
narva
had
been
prosecuting
his
reforms
and
reorganizing
his
army
and
building
a
navy
was
more
of
a
wily
statesman
than
a
successful
general
he
retreated
before
charles
avoided
battles
tempted
him
in
the
pursuit
to
dreary
and
sparsely
inhabited
districts
decoyed
him
into
provinces
remote
from
his
base
of
supplies
so
that
at
the
approach
of
winter
charles
found
himself
in
a
cold
and
desolate
country
as
napoleon
was
afterwards
tempted
to
ruin
with
his
army
dwindled
down
to
thousand
men
while
peter
had
one
hundred
thousand
with
ample
provisions
and
military
stores
the
generals
of
charles
now
implore
him
to
return
to
sweden
at
least
to
seek
winter
quarters
in
the
ukraine
but
the
monarch
infatuated
lays
siege
to
pultowa
and
gives
battle
to
peter
and
is
not
only
defeated
but
his
forces
are
almost
annihilated
so
that
he
finds
the
greatest
difficulty
in
escaping
into
turkey
with
a
handful
of
followers
that
battle
settled
the
fortunes
of
both
charles
and
peter
the
one
was
hopelessly
ruined
the
other
was
left
free
to
take
as
much
territory
from
sweden
as
he
wished
to
open
his
seaports
on
the
baltic
and
to
dig
canals
from
river
to
river
but
another
enemy
still
remained
turkey
who
sought
to
recover
her
territory
on
the
black
sea
and
who
had
already
declared
war
flushed
with
conquest
peter
in
his
turn
became
rash
he
advanced
to
the
turkish
territory
with
forty
thousand
men
and
was
led
into
the
same
trap
which
proved
the
ruin
of
charles
xii
he
suddenly
finds
himself
in
a
hostile
country
beyond
the
pruth
between
an
army
of
turks
and
an
army
of
tartars
with
a
deep
and
rapid
river
in
his
rear
two
hundred
thousand
men
attack
his
forty
thousand
he
can
not
advance
he
can
not
retreat
he
is
threatened
with
annihilation
he
is
driven
to
despair
neither
he
nor
his
generals
can
see
any
escape
for
in
three
days
he
has
lost
twenty
thousand
men
one
half
his
army
in
all
probability
he
and
his
remaining
men
will
be
captured
and
he
conducted
as
a
prisoner
to
constantinople
and
perhaps
be
shown
to
the
mocking
and
jeering
people
in
a
cage
as
bajazet
was
in
this
crisis
he
shuts
himself
up
in
his
tent
and
refuses
to
see
anybody
he
is
saved
by
a
woman
and
a
great
woman
even
catherine
his
wife
who
originally
was
a
poor
peasant
girl
in
livonia
and
who
after
various
adventures
became
the
wife
of
a
young
swedish
officer
killed
at
the
battle
of
marienburg
and
then
the
mistress
of
prince
mentchikof
and
then
of
peter
himself
who
at
length
married
her
an
incident
says
voltaire
which
fortune
and
merit
never
before
produced
in
the
annals
of
the
world
she
suggested
negotiation
when
peter
was
in
the
very
jaws
of
destruction
and
which
nobody
had
thought
of
she
collects
together
her
jewels
and
all
the
valuables
she
can
find
and
sends
them
to
the
turkish
general
as
a
present
and
favorable
terms
are
secured
but
peter
loses
azof
and
is
shut
out
from
the
black
sea
and
is
compelled
to
withdraw
from
the
vicinity
of
the
danube
the
baltic
is
however
still
open
to
him
and
in
the
mean
time
he
has
transferred
his
capital
to
a
new
city
which
he
built
on
the
gulf
of
finland
it
was
during
his
swedish
war
about
the
year
when
he
had
driven
the
swedes
from
ladoga
and
the
neva
that
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
a
miserable
morass
a
delta
half
under
water
formed
by
the
dividing
branches
of
the
neva
as
the
future
seat
of
his
vast
empire
it
was
a
poor
site
for
a
capital
city
inaccessible
by
water
half
the
year
without
stones
without
wood
without
any
building
materials
with
a
barren
soil
and
liable
to
be
submerged
in
a
storm
some
would
say
it
was
an
immense
mistake
to
select
such
a
place
for
the
capital
of
an
empire
stretching
even
to
the
pacific
ocean
but
it
was
the
only
place
he
could
get
which
opened
a
water
communication
with
western
europe
he
could
not
europeanize
his
empire
without
some
such
location
for
his
new
capital
so
petersburg
arose
above
the
marshes
of
the
neva
as
if
by
magic
built
in
a
year
on
piles
although
it
cost
him
the
lives
of
one
hundred
thousand
men
we
never
could
look
on
this
capital
says
motley
with
its
imposing
though
monotonous
architecture
its
colossal
squares
its
vast
colonnades
its
endless
vistas
its
spires
and
minarets
sheathed
in
barbaric
gold
and
flashing
in
the
sun
and
remember
the
magical
rapidity
with
which
it
was
built
without
recalling
description
of
pandemonium
bees
in
spring
time
when
the
sun
with
taurus
rides
pour
forth
their
populous
youth
about
the
hive
in
clusters
they
among
fresh
dews
and
flowers
fly
to
and
fro
or
on
the
smoothed
plank
the
suburb
of
their
citadel
now
rubbed
with
balm
expatiate
and
confer
their
state
affairs
so
thick
the
aery
crowd
swarm
and
were
straighten
till
the
signal
given
behold
a
wonder
the
transfer
of
the
seat
of
government
by
the
removal
of
the
senate
from
moscow
was
effected
a
few
years
afterwards
since
that
time
the
repudiated
oriental
capital
of
the
ancient
czars
with
her
golden
tiara
and
eastern
robe
has
sat
like
hagar
in
the
wilderness
deserted
and
lonely
in
all
her
barbarian
beauty
yet
even
now
in
many
a
backward
look
and
longing
sigh
she
reads
plainly
enough
that
she
is
not
forgotten
by
her
sovereign
that
she
is
still
at
heart
preferred
and
that
she
will
eventually
triumph
over
her
usurping
and
artificial
rival
so
writes
a
great
historian
but
to
me
it
seems
that
the
longing
eyes
of
the
emperor
of
russia
are
not
turned
to
the
old
barbaric
capital
but
to
a
still
more
ancient
capital
that
which
constantine
with
vision
selected
as
the
central
city
of
the
decaying
empire
of
the
romans
easily
defended
resting
on
both
europe
and
asia
with
access
to
the
mediterranean
and
black
seas
the
most
magnificent
site
for
the
capital
of
a
great
empire
on
the
face
of
the
globe
which
is
needed
by
russia
if
she
is
to
preserve
her
maritime
power
and
which
nothing
but
the
jealousy
of
the
western
nations
has
prevented
her
from
twice
seizing
within
a
single
generation
we
say
westward
the
star
of
empire
takes
its
way
but
an
empire
larger
in
its
territories
than
all
europe
and
constantly
augmenting
its
resources
although
still
cossack
still
undeveloped
has
its
eye
on
eastern
not
western
extension
until
china
herself
with
her
four
thousand
years
of
civilization
and
her
four
hundred
millions
of
people
may
become
a
spoil
to
be
divided
between
the
emperor
of
russia
and
the
empress
of
india
not
as
banded
and
united
robbers
divide
their
spoil
but
the
one
encroaching
from
the
west
and
north
and
the
other
from
the
west
and
south
peter
after
having
realized
the
great
objects
to
which
he
early
aspired
after
having
founded
a
navy
and
reorganized
his
army
and
added
provinces
to
his
empire
and
partially
civilized
it
and
given
to
it
a
new
capital
now
meditated
a
second
tour
of
europe
this
time
to
be
accompanied
by
his
wife
thirteen
years
had
elapsed
since
he
worked
as
a
in
the
of
holland
he
was
now
years
old
still
manly
vigorous
and
inquiring
in
just
as
louis
had
completed
his
brilliant
and
yet
unfortunate
career
peter
first
revisited
the
scene
of
his
early
labors
where
he
was
enthusiastically
received
and
was
afterwards
entertained
with
great
distinction
at
paris
he
continued
his
studies
in
art
in
science
and
laws
saw
everything
and
was
particularly
impressed
with
the
tomb
of
richelieu
great
man
apostrophizes
the
czar
i
would
give
half
of
my
kingdom
to
learn
from
thee
how
to
govern
the
other
half
such
remarks
indicate
that
he
knew
something
of
history
and
comprehended
the
mission
of
the
great
cardinal
which
was
to
establish
absolutism
as
one
of
the
needed
forces
of
the
seventeenth
century
for
it
was
richelieu
hateful
as
is
his
character
who
built
up
the
french
monarchy
from
paris
peter
proceeded
to
berlin
where
he
was
received
with
equal
attentions
he
inspired
universal
respect
although
his
aspect
was
fierce
his
habits
rough
and
his
manners
uncouth
the
one
thing
which
marked
him
as
a
great
man
was
his
force
of
character
he
was
undazzled
and
unseduced
plain
simple
temperate
and
straightforward
he
had
not
worked
for
himself
but
for
his
country
and
everybody
knew
it
his
wife
catherine
also
a
great
woman
did
not
make
so
good
an
impression
as
he
did
being
fat
vulgar
and
covered
with
jewels
and
orders
and
crosses
i
suppose
both
of
them
were
what
we
now
should
call
plain
people
station
power
and
wealth
seem
to
have
very
little
effect
on
the
manners
and
habits
of
those
who
have
arisen
by
extraordinary
talents
to
an
exalted
position
nor
does
this
position
develop
pride
as
much
as
is
generally
supposed
pride
is
born
in
a
man
and
will
appear
if
he
is
ever
so
lowly
as
also
vanity
the
more
amiable
quality
which
expends
itself
in
hospitalities
and
ostentations
the
proud
gladstone
dresses
like
a
methodist
minister
and
does
not
seem
to
care
what
kind
of
a
hat
he
wears
the
vain
beaconsfield
loved
honors
and
stars
and
flatteries
and
aristocratic
insignia
if
he
had
been
rich
he
would
have
been
prodigal
and
given
great
banquets
peter
made
no
display
and
saved
his
money
for
useful
purposes
it
would
seem
that
most
of
the
russian
monarchs
have
retained
simplicity
in
their
private
lives
the
closing
years
of
peter
were
saddened
by
a
great
tragedy
as
were
those
of
david
both
these
monarchs
had
the
misfortune
to
have
rebellious
and
unworthy
sons
who
were
heirs
to
the
throne
alexis
was
as
great
a
trial
to
peter
as
absalom
was
to
david
he
was
hostile
to
reforms
was
in
league
with
his
father
enemies
and
was
hopelessly
stupid
and
profligate
he
was
not
vain
ambitious
and
beautiful
like
the
son
of
david
but
coarse
in
bondage
to
priests
fond
of
the
society
of
the
weak
and
dissipated
and
utterly
unfitted
to
rule
an
empire
had
he
succeeded
peter
the
of
peter
would
have
been
wasted
his
reign
would
have
been
as
disastrous
to
russia
as
that
of
mary
queen
of
scots
would
have
been
to
england
had
she
succeeded
elizabeth
the
patience
of
the
father
was
at
last
exhausted
he
had
remonstrated
and
threatened
to
no
purpose
the
young
man
would
not
reform
his
habits
or
abstain
from
dangerous
intrigues
he
got
beastly
drunk
with
convivial
friends
and
robbed
and
cheated
his
father
whenever
he
got
a
chance
what
was
peter
to
do
with
such
a
rebellious
undutiful
profligate
silly
youth
as
alexis
a
sot
a
bigot
and
a
liar
should
he
leave
to
him
the
work
of
carrying
out
his
policy
and
aims
it
would
be
weakness
and
madness
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
disinherit
him
in
so
doing
he
would
render
no
injustice
alexis
had
no
claim
to
the
throne
like
the
eldest
son
of
victoria
the
throne
belonged
to
peter
he
had
no
fetters
on
him
like
a
feudal
sovereign
he
could
elect
whom
he
pleased
to
inherit
his
vast
empire
it
was
not
his
son
he
loved
best
but
his
country
he
had
the
right
to
appoint
any
successor
he
pleased
and
he
would
naturally
select
one
who
would
carry
out
his
plans
and
rule
ably
so
he
disinherited
his
eldest
son
alexis
and
did
it
in
virtue
of
the
power
which
he
imagined
he
had
received
like
an
old
jewish
patriarch
from
god
almighty
there
was
no
law
of
russia
designating
the
eldest
son
as
the
czar
successor
no
one
can
reasonably
blame
peter
for
disinheriting
this
worthless
son
whom
he
had
ceased
to
love
whom
he
even
despised
having
disinherited
him
out
of
regard
to
public
interests
more
than
personal
dislike
the
question
arises
what
shall
he
do
with
him
shall
he
shut
him
in
a
or
confine
him
to
a
convent
or
make
way
with
him
one
of
these
terrible
alternatives
he
must
take
what
struggles
of
his
soul
to
decide
which
were
best
we
pity
a
man
compelled
to
make
such
a
choice
any
choice
was
bad
and
full
of
perils
and
calumnies
whatever
way
he
turned
was
full
of
obstacles
if
he
should
shut
him
up
the
priests
and
humiliated
boyars
and
other
intriguing
rascals
might
make
him
emperor
after
peter
death
and
thus
create
a
counter
reformation
and
upset
the
work
of
peter
life
if
he
should
make
way
with
alexis
the
curses
of
his
enemies
and
the
execrations
of
europe
and
posterity
would
follow
him
as
an
unnatural
father
david
with
his
tender
nature
and
deep
affection
would
have
spared
absalom
if
all
the
hosts
of
israel
had
fallen
and
his
throne
were
overturned
but
peter
was
not
so
weak
as
david
he
was
stern
and
severe
he
decided
to
bring
his
son
to
trial
for
conspiracy
and
rebellion
the
court
found
him
guilty
the
ministers
generals
and
senators
of
the
empire
pronounced
sentence
of
death
upon
him
would
the
father
have
used
his
prerogative
and
pardoned
him
that
we
can
never
know
some
think
that
peter
did
not
intend
to
execute
the
sentence
at
any
rate
he
was
mercifully
delivered
from
his
dilemma
alexis
frightened
and
apparently
contrite
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
apoplexy
and
died
imploring
his
father
pardon
this
tragedy
is
regarded
as
the
great
stain
on
the
reign
of
peter
it
shocked
the
civilized
world
i
do
not
wish
to
exculpate
peter
from
cruelty
or
hardheartedness
i
would
neither
justify
him
nor
condemn
him
in
this
matter
i
think
he
is
to
be
judged
by
the
supreme
tribunal
of
heaven
i
do
not
know
enough
to
acquit
or
condemn
him
all
i
know
is
that
his
treatment
of
his
son
was
both
a
misfortune
and
a
stain
on
his
memory
the
people
to
decide
this
point
are
those
rich
fathers
who
have
rebellious
prodigal
reckless
and
worthless
sons
hopelessly
dissipated
and
rendered
imbecile
by
and
wasteful
revels
or
those
people
who
discuss
the
expediency
and
apparent
state
necessity
for
the
execution
of
mary
queen
of
scots
when
the
welfare
of
a
great
kingdom
was
set
against
the
ties
of
blood
after
the
death
of
alexis
a
few
more
years
are
given
to
the
czar
to
follow
out
his
improvements
centralize
his
throne
and
extend
his
territories
both
on
the
baltic
and
in
the
east
the
death
of
charles
xii
enabled
him
to
take
what
swedish
provinces
he
needed
to
protect
his
mercantile
interests
and
to
snatch
from
persia
the
southern
coast
of
the
caspian
the
original
kingdom
of
cyrus
it
is
not
land
i
want
said
he
but
water
this
is
the
key
to
all
his
conquests
he
wanted
an
outlet
to
the
sea
on
both
sides
his
empire
he
did
not
aim
at
territorial
enlargement
so
much
as
at
facilities
to
enrich
and
civilize
his
empire
having
done
his
work
the
work
i
think
for
which
he
was
raised
up
he
sets
about
the
succession
to
his
throne
amid
unprecedented
pomp
he
celebrates
the
coronation
of
his
faithful
and
devoted
wife
to
whom
he
also
has
been
faithful
it
is
she
only
who
understands
and
can
carry
out
his
imperial
policy
he
himself
at
moscow
amid
unusual
solemnities
placed
the
imperial
crown
upon
her
brow
and
proudly
and
yet
humbly
walked
before
her
in
the
gorgeous
procession
as
a
captain
of
her
guard
before
all
the
great
dignitaries
of
his
empire
he
gives
the
following
reasons
for
his
course
the
empress
catherine
our
dearest
consort
was
an
important
help
to
us
in
all
our
dangers
not
in
war
alone
but
in
other
expeditions
in
which
she
voluntarily
accompanied
us
serving
us
with
her
able
counsel
notwithstanding
the
natural
weakness
of
her
sex
more
particularly
at
the
battle
of
pruth
when
our
army
was
reduced
to
thousand
men
while
the
turks
were
two
hundred
thousand
strong
it
was
in
this
desperate
condition
above
all
others
that
she
signalized
her
zeal
by
a
courage
superior
to
her
sex
for
which
reasons
and
in
virtue
of
that
power
which
god
has
given
us
we
thus
honor
our
spouse
with
the
imperial
crown
peter
died
in
the
following
year
after
a
reign
of
more
than
forty
years
bequeathing
a
centralized
empire
to
his
successors
a
large
and
disciplined
army
a
respectable
navy
and
many
improvements
in
agriculture
manufactures
commerce
and
the
arts
yea
schools
and
universities
for
the
education
of
the
higher
classes
whatever
may
have
been
the
faults
of
peter
history
can
not
accuse
him
of
ingratitude
or
insincerity
or
weak
affections
nothing
of
which
is
seen
in
his
treatment
of
the
honest
dutchman
in
whose
yard
he
worked
as
a
common
laborer
of
lefort
whom
he
made
admiral
of
his
fleet
or
of
mentchikof
whom
he
elevated
to
the
second
place
in
his
empire
peter
was
not
a
great
warrior
but
he
created
armies
he
had
traits
in
common
with
barbarians
but
he
bequeathed
a
new
civilization
and
dispelled
the
night
of
hereditary
darkness
he
owed
nothing
to
art
he
looms
up
as
a
prodigy
of
nature
he
cared
nothing
for
public
opinion
he
left
the
moral
influence
of
a
great
example
he
began
with
no
particular
aim
except
to
join
his
country
to
the
sea
he
bequeathed
a
policy
of
indefinite
expansion
he
did
not
leave
free
institutions
for
his
country
was
not
prepared
for
them
but
he
animated
thirty
millions
with
an
intense
and
religious
loyalty
he
did
not
emancipate
serfs
but
he
bequeathed
a
power
which
enabled
his
successors
to
loosen
fetters
with
safety
he
degraded
nobles
but
his
nobles
would
have
prevented
if
they
could
the
emancipation
of
the
people
he
may
have
wasted
his
energies
in
condescending
to
mean
details
and
insisting
on
doing
everything
with
his
own
hands
from
drummer
to
general
and
to
admiral
winning
battles
with
his
own
sword
and
singing
in
the
choir
as
head
of
the
church
but
in
so
doing
he
made
the
mistake
of
charlemagne
whom
he
strikingly
resembles
in
his
iron
will
his
herculean
energies
and
his
enlightened
mind
he
could
not
convert
his
subjects
from
cattle
into
men
even
had
he
wished
for
civilization
is
a
long
and
tedious
process
but
he
made
them
the
subjects
of
a
great
empire
destined
to
spread
from
sea
to
sea
certainly
he
was
in
advance
of
his
people
he
broke
away
from
the
ideas
which
enslaved
them
he
may
have
been
despotic
and
inexorable
and
but
that
was
just
such
a
man
as
his
country
needed
for
a
ruler
motley
likens
him
to
a
huge
engine
placed
upon
the

to
effect
a
certain
task
working
its
mighty
arms
night
and
day
with
ceaseless
and
untiring
energy
crashing
through
all
obstacles
and
annihilating
everything
in
its
path
with
the
unfeeling
precision
of
gigantic
mechanism
i
should
say
he
was
an
instrument
of
almighty
power
to
bring
good
out
of
evil
and
prepare
the
way
for
a
civilization
the
higher
elements
of
which
he
did
not
understand
and
with
which
he
would

have
sympathized
who
shall
say
as
we
survey
his
mighty
labors
and
the
indomitable
energy
and
genius
which
inspired
them
that
he
does
not
deserve
the

history
of
peter
the
great
frederic
the
great
the
prussian
power
the
history
of
frederic
the
great
is
simply
that
of
a
man
who
committed
an
outrageous
crime
the
consequences
of
which
pursued
him
in
the
maledictions
and
hostilities
of
europe
and
who
fought
bravely
and
heroically
to
rescue
himself
and
country
from
the
ruin
which
impended
over
him
as
a
consequence
of
this
crime
his
heroism
his
fertility
of
resources
his
unflagging
energy
and
his
amazing
genius
in
overcoming
difficulties
won
for
him
the
admiration
of
that
class
who
idolize
strength
and
success
so
that
he
stands
out
in
history
as
a
struggling
gladiator
who
baffled
all
his
foes
not
a
dying
gladiator
on
the
arena
of
a
pagan
amphitheatre
but
more
like
a
judas
maccabaeus
when
hunted
by
the
syrian
hosts
rising
victorious
and
laying
the
foundation
of
a
powerful
monarchy
indeed
his
fame
spread
irrespective
of
his
cause
and
character
from
one
end
of
christendom
to
the
other
not
such
a
fame
as
endeared
gustavus
adolphus
to
the
heart
of
nations
for
heroic
efforts
to
save
the
protestant
religion
but
such
a
fame
as
the
successful
generals
of
ancient
rome
won
by
adding
territories
to
a
warlike
state
regardless
of
all
the
principles
of
right
and
wrong
such
a
career
is
suggestive
of
grand
moral
lessons
and
it
is
to
teach
these
lessons
that
i
describe
a
character
for
whom
i
confess
i
feel
but
little
sympathy
yet
whom
i
am
compelled
to
respect
for
his
heroic
qualities
and
great
abilities
frederic
of
prussia
was
born
in
and
had
an
unhappy
childhood
and
youth
from
the
caprices
of
a
royal
but
disagreeable
father
best
known
for
his
tall
regiment
of
guards
a
severe
austere
prejudiced
formal
narrow
and
hypochondriacal
old
pharisee
whose
sole
redeeming
excellence
was
an
avowed
belief
in
god
almighty
and
in
the
orthodox
doctrines
of
the
protestant
church
in
this
rigid
exacting
unsympathetic
king
died
and
his
son
frederic
who
had
been
subjected
to
the
severest
discipline
restraints
annoyances
and
humiliations
ascended
the
throne
and
became
the
third
king
of
prussia
at
the
age
of
his
kingdom
was
a
small
one
being
then
about
one
quarter
of
its
present
size
and
here
we
pause
for
a
moment
to
give
a
glance
at
the
age
in
which
he
lived
an
age
of
great
reactions
when
the
stirring
themes
and
issues
of
the
seventeenth
century
were
substituted
for
mockeries
levities
and
infidelities
when
no
fierce
protests
were
made
except
those
of
voltaire
against
the
jesuits
when
an
abandoned
woman
ruled
france
as
the
mistress
of
an
enervated
monarch
when
spain
and
italy
were
sunk
in
lethargic
forgetfulness
austria
was
and
england
was
governed
by
a
ring
of
selfish
lauded
proprietors
when
there
was
no
marked
enterprise
but
the
when
no
department
of
literature
or
science
was
adorned
by
original
genius
and
when
england
had
no
broader
statesman
than
walpole
no
abler
churchman
than
warburton
no
greater
poet
than
pope
there
was
a
general
indifference
to
lofty
speculation
a
materialistic
philosophy
was
in
fashion
not
openly
atheistic
but
arrogant
and
pretentious
whose
only
power
was
in
sarcasm
and
mockery
like
the
satires
of
lucian
extinguishing
faith
godless
and
yet
boastful
an
epicureanism
such
as
socrates
attacked
and
paul
rebuked
it
found
its
greatest
exponent
in
voltaire
the
oracle
and
idol
of
intellectual
europe
in
short
it
was
an
age
when
general
cynicism
and
reckless
abandonment
to
pleasure
marked
the
an
age
which
produced
chesterfield
as
godless
a
man
as
voltaire
himself
in
this
period
of
religious
infidelity
moral
torpor
fashionable
mediocrity
unthinking
and
royal
orgies
when
the
people
were
spurned
insuited
and
burdened
frederic
ascends
an
absolute
throne
he
is
a
young
and
fashionable
philosopher
he
professes
to
believe
in
nothing
that
ages
of
inquiry
and
study
are
supposed
to
have
settled
he
even
ridicules
the
religious
principles
of
his
father
he
ardently
adopts
everything
which
claims
to
be
a
novelty
but
is
not
learned
enough
to
know
that
what
he
supposes
to
be
new
has
been
exploded
over
and
over
again
he
is
liberal
and
tolerant
but
does
not
see
the
logical
sequence
of
the
very
opinions
he
indorses
he
is
also
what
is
called
an
accomplished
man
since
he
can
play
on
an
instrument
and
amuse
a
by
jokes
and
stories
he
builds
a
magnificent
theatre
and
collects
statues
pictures
and
old
china
he
welcomes
to
his
court
not
stern
thinkers
but
sneering
and
amusing
philosophers
he
employs
in
his
service
both
catholics
and
protestants
alike
since
he
holds
in
contempt
the
religion
of
both
he
is
free
from
animosities
and
friendships
and
neither
punishes
those
who
are
his
enemies
nor
rewards
those
who
are
his
friends
he
apes
reform
but
shackles
the
press
he
appoints
able
men
in
his
service
but
only
those
who
will
be
his
unscrupulous
tools
he
has
a
fine
physique
and
therefore
is
unceasingly
active
he
flies
from
one
part
of
his
kingdom
to
another
not
to
examine
morals
or
education
or
the
state
of
the
people
but
to
inspect
fortresses
and
to
collect
camps
to
such
a
man
the
development
of
the
resources
of
his
kingdom
the
reform
of
abuses
and
educational
projects
are
of
secondary
importance
he
gives
his
primary
attention
to
raising
and
equipping
armies
having
in
view
the
extension
of
his
kingdom
by
aggressive
and
unjustifiable
wars
he
cares
little
for
domestic
joys
or
the
society
of
women
and
is
incapable
of
sincere
friendship
he
has
no
true
admiration
for
intellectual
excellence
although
he
patronizes
literary
lions
he
is
incapable
of
any
sacrifice
except
for
his
troops
who
worship
him
since
their
interests
are
identical
with
his
own
in
the
camp
or
in
the
field
he
spends
his
time
amusing
himself
occasionally
with
the
society
of
philosophers
as
cynical
as
himself
he
has
dreams
and
visions
of
military
glory
which
to
him
is
the
highest
and
greatest
on
this
earth
charles
xii
being
his
model
of
a
hero
with
such
views
he
enters
upon
a
memorable
career
his
first
important
public
act
as
king
is
the
seizure
of
part
of
the
territory
of
the
bishop
of
liege
which
he
claims
as
belonging
to
prussia
the
old
bishop
is
indignant
and
amazed
but
is
obliged
to
submit
to
a
robbery
which
disgusts
christendom
but
is
not
of
sufficient
consequence
to
set
it
in
a
blaze
the
next
thing
he
does
of
historical
importance
is
to
seize
silesia
a
province
which
belongs
to
austria
and
contains
about
twenty
thousand
square
miles
a
fertile
and
beautiful
province
nearly
as
large
as
his
own
kingdom
it
is
the
highest
of
germany
girt
around
with
mountains
hard
to
attack
and
easy
to
defend
so
rapid
and
secret
are
his
movements
that
this
unsuspecting
and
undefended
country
is
overrun
by
his
veteran
soldiers
as
easily
as
louis
xiv
overran
flanders
and
holland
and
with
no
better
excuse
than
the
french
king
had
this
outrage
was
an
open
insult
to
europe
as
well
as
a
great
wrong
to
maria
theresa
supposed
by
him
to
be
a
feeble
woman
who
could
not
resent
the
injury
but
in
this
woman
he
found
the
great
enemy
of
his
life
a
lioness
deprived
of
her
whelps
whose
wailing
was
so
piteous
and
so
savage
that
she
aroused
europe
from
lethargy
and
made
coalitions
which
shook
it
to
its
centre
at
first
she
simply
rallied
her
own
troops
and
fought
to
recover
her
lost
and
most
valued
province
but
frederic
with
marvellous
celerity
and
ability
got
possession
of
the
silesian
fortresses
the
bloody
battle
of
mollwitz
secured
his
prey
and
he
returned
in
triumph
to
his
capital
to
abide
the
issue
of
events
it
is
not
easy
to
determine
whether
this
atrocious
crime
which
astonished
europe
was
the
result
of
his
early
passion
for
military
glory
or
the
inauguration
of
a
policy
of
aggression
and
aggrandizement
but
it
was
the
signal
of
an
explosion
of
european
politics
which
ended
in
one
of
the
most
bloody
wars
of
modern
times
it
was
says
carlyle
the
little
stone
broken
loose
from
the
mountain
hitting
others
big
and
little
which
again
hit
others
with
their
leaping
and
rolling
till
the
whole
was
in
motion
under
law
of
gravity
maria
theresa
appeals
to
her
hungarian
nobles
with
her
infant
in
her
arms
at
a
diet
of
the
nation
and
sends
her
envoys
to
every
friendly
court
she
offers
her
unscrupulous
enemy
the
duchy
of
limberg
and
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
to
relinquish
his
grasp
on
silesia
it
is
like
the
offer
of
darius
to
alexander
and
is
spurned
by
the
prussian
robber
it
is
not
limberg
he
wants
nor
money
but
silesia
which
he
resolves
to
keep
because
he
wants
it
and
at
any
hazard
even
were
he
to
jeopardize
his
own
hereditary
dominions
the
peace
of
breslau
gives
him
a
temporary
leisure
and
he
takes
the
waters
of
aachen
and
discusses
philosophy
he
is
uneasy
but
jubilant
for
he
has
nearly
doubled
the
territory
and
population
of
prussia
his
subjects
proclaim
him
a
hero
with
immense
paeans
doubtless
too
he
now
desires
peace
just
as
louis
xiv
did
after
he
had
conquered
holland
and
as
napoleon
did
when
he
had
seated
his
brothers
on
the
old
thrones
of
europe
but
there
can
be
no
lasting
peace
after
such
outrageous
wickedness
the
angered
kings
and
princes
of
europe
are
to
become
the
instruments
of
eternal
justice
they
listen
to
the
eloquent
cries
of
the
austrian
empress
and
prepare
for
war
to
punish
the
audacious
robber
who
disturbs
the
peace
of
the
world
and
insults
all
other
nationalities
but
they
are
not
yet
ready
for
effective
war
the
storm
does
not
at
once
break
out
the
austrians
however
will
not
wait
and
the
second
silesian
war
ensues
in
which
saxony
joins
austria
again
is
frederic
successful
over
the
combined
forces
of
these
two
powers
and
he
retains
his
stolen
province
he
is
now
regarded
as
a
for
he
has
fought
bravely
against
vastly
superior
forces
and
is
received
in
berlin
with
unbounded
enthusiasm
he
renews
his
studies
in
philosophy
courts
literary
celebrities
reorganizes
his
army
and
collects
forces
for
a
renewed
encounter
which
he
foresees
he
has
ten
years
of
repose
and
preparation
during
which
he
is
lauded
and
nattered
yet
retaining
simplicity
of
habits
sleeping
but
five
hours
a
day
finding
time
for
state
dinners
and
operas
of
all
which
he
is
fond
for
he
was
doubtless
a
man
of
culture
social
well
read
if
not
profound
witty
inquiring
and
without
any
striking
defects
save
tyranny
ambition
parsimony
dissimulation
and
lying
it
was
during
those
ten
years
of
rest
and
military
preparation
that
voltaire
made
his
memorable
visit
his
third
and
last
to
potsdam
and
berlin
months
of
alternate
triumph
and
humiliation
no
literary
man
ever
had
so
successful
and
brilliant
a
career
as
this
fortunate
and
lauded
frenchman
the
oracle
of
all
salons
the
arbiter
of
literary
fashions
a
dictator
in
the
realm
of
letters
with
amazing
fecundity
of
genius
directed
into
all
fields
of
labor
poet
historian
dramatist
and
philosopher
writing
books
enough
to
load
a
cart
and
all
of
them
admired
and
extolled
all
of
them
scattered
over
europe
read
by
all
nations
a
marvellous
worker
of
unbounded
wit
and
unexampled
popularity
whose
greatest
literary
merit
was
in
the
transcendent
excellence
of
his
style
for
which
chiefly
he
is
immortal
a
great
artist
rather
than
an
original
and
profound
genius
whose
ideas
form
the
basis
of
civilizations
the
king
of
prussia
formed
an
ardent
friendship
for
this
king
of
letters
based
on
admiration
rather
than
respect
invited
him
to
his
court
extolled
and
honored
him
and
lavished
on
him
all
that
he
could
bestow
outside
of
political
distinction
but
no
worldly
friendship
could
stand
such
a
test
as
both
were
subjected
to
since
they
at
last
comprehended
each
other
character
and
designs
voltaire
perceived
the
tyranny
the
ambition
the
heartlessness
the
egotism
and
the
exactions
of
his
royal
patron
and
despised
him
while
he
flattered
him
and
frederic
on
his
part
saw
the
hollowness
the
meanness
the
suspicion
the
irritability
the
pride
the
insincerity
the
tricks
the
ingratitude
the
baseness
the
lies
of
his
distinguished
guest
and
their
friendship
ended
in
utter
vanity
what
friendship
can
last
without
mutual
respect
the
friendship
of
frederic
and
voltaire
was
hopelessly
broken
in
spite
of
the
remembrance
of
mutual
admiration
and
happy
hours
it
was
patched
up
and
mended
like
a
broken
vase
but
it
could
not
be
restored
how
sad
how
mournful
how
humiliating
is
a
broken
friendship
or
an
alienated
love
it
is
the
falling
away
of
the
foundations
of
the
soul
the
disappearance
forever
of
what
is
most
to
be
prized
on
earth
its
celestial
certitudes
a
beloved
friend
may
die
but
we
are
consoled
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
friendship
may
be
continued
in
heaven
the
friend
is
not
lost
to
us
but
when
a
friendship
or
a
love
is
broken
there
is
no
continuance
of
it
through
eternity
it
is
the
gloomiest
thing
to
think
of
in
this
whole
world
but
frederic
was
too
busy
and
a
man
to
mourn
long
for
a
departed
joy
he
was
absorbed
in
preparations
for
war
the
sword
of
damocles
was
suspended
over
his
head
and
he
knew
it
better
than
any
other
man
in
europe
he
knew
it
from
his
spies
and
emissaries
though
he
had
enjoyed
ten
years
peace
he
knew
that
peace
was
only
a
truce
that
the
nations
were
arming
in
behalf
of
the
injured
empress
that
so
great
a
crime
as
the
seizure
of
silesia
must
be
visited
with
a
penalty
that
there
was
no
escape
for
him
except
in
a
tremendous
struggle
which
was
to
be
the
trial
of
his
life
that
defeat
was
more
than
probable
since
the
forces
in
preparation
against
him
were
overwhelming
the
curses
of
the
civilized
world
still
pursued
him
and
in
his
retreat
at
he
had
no
rest
and
hence
he
became
irritable
and
suspicious
the
clouds
of
the
political
atmosphere
were
filled
with
thunderbolts
ready
to
fall
upon
him
and
crush
him
at
any
moment
indeed
nothing
could
arrest
the
storm
it
broke
out
with
unprecedented
fury
in
the
spring
of
austria
russia
sweden
saxony
and
france
were
combined
to
ruin
him
the
most
powerful
coalition
of
the
european
powers
seen
since
the
thirty
war
his
only
ally
was
england
an
ally
not
so
much
to
succor
him
as
to
humble
france
and
hence
her
aid
was
timid
and
incompetent
thus
began
the
famous
seven
years
war
during
which
france
lost
her
colonial
possessions
and
was
signally
humiliated
at
home
a
war
which
developed
the
genius
of
the
elder
pitt
and
placed
england
in
the
proud
position
of
mistress
of
the
ocean
a
war
marked
by
the
largest
array
of
forces
which
europe
had
seen
since
the
times
of
charles
in
which
six
hundred
thousand
men
were
marshalled
under
different
leaders
and
nations
to
crush
a
man
who
had
insulted
europe
and
defied
the
law
of
nations
and
the
laws
of
god
the
coalition
represented
one
hundred
millions
of
people
with
inexhaustible
resources
now
it
was
the
memorable
resistance
of
frederic
ii
to
this
vast
array
of
forces
and
his
successful
retention
of
the
province
he
had
seized
which
gave
him
his
chief
claim
as
a
hero
and
it
was
his
patience
his
fortitude
his
energy
his
fertility
of
resources
and
the
enthusiasm
with
which
he
inspired
his
troops
even
after
the
most
discouraging
and
demoralizing
defeats
that
won
for
him
that
universal
admiration
as
a
man
which
he
lived
to
secure
in
spite
of
all
his
defects
and
crimes
we
admire
the
resources
and
dexterity
of
an
outlawed
bandit
but
we
should
remember
he
is
a
bandit
still
and
we
confound
all
the
laws
which
hold
society
together
when
we
cover
up
the
iniquity
of
a
great
crime
by
the
successes
which
have
apparently
baffled
justice
frederic
by
stealing
silesia
and
thus
provoking
a
great
war
of
untold
and
indescribable
miseries
is
entitled
to
anything
but
admiration
whatever
may
have
been
his
military
genius
and
i
am
amazed
that
so
great
a
man
as
carlyle
with
all
his
hatred
of
shams
and
his
clear
perceptions
of
justice
and
truth
should
have
whitewashed
such
a
robber
i
can
not
conceive
how
the
severest
critic
of
the
age
should
have
spent
the
best
years
of
his
life
in
apologies
for
so
bad
a
man
if
his
own
philosophy
had
not
become
radically
unsound
based
on
the
abominable
doctrine
that
the
end
justifies
the
means
and
that
an
outward
success
is
the
test
of
right
far
different
was
carlyle
treatment
of
cromwell
frederic
had
no
such
cause
as
cromwell
it
was
simply
his
own
or
his
aggrandizement
by
any
means
or
by
any
sword
he
could
lay
hold
of
the
chief
merit
of
carlyle
history
is
his
impartiality
and
accuracy
in
describing
the
details
of
the
contest
the
cause
of
the
contest
he
does
not
sufficiently
reprobate
and
all
his
sympathies
seem
to
be
with
the
unscrupulous
robber
who
fights
heroically
rather
than
with
indignant
europe
outraged
by
his
crimes
but
we
can
not
separate
crime
from
its
consequences
and
all
the
reverses
the
sorrows
the
perils
the
hardships
the
humiliations
the
immense
losses
the
dreadful
calamities
through
which
prussia
had
to
pass
which
wrung
even
the
heart
of
frederic
with
anguish
were
only
a
merited
retribution
the
seven
war
was
a
in
which
all
the
forces
of
the
surrounding
monarchies
gathered
around
the
doomed
man
making
his
circle
smaller
and
smaller
and
which
would
certainly
have
ended
in
his
utter
ruin
had
he
not
been
rescued
by
events
as
unexpected
as
they
were
unparalleled
had
some
great
and
powerful
foe
been
converted
suddenly
into
a
friend
at
a
critical
moment
napoleon
another
unscrupulous
robber
might
not
have
been
defeated
at
waterloo
or
died
on
a
rock
in
the
ocean
but
providence
it
would
seem
who
rules
the
fate
of
war
had
some
inscrutable
reason
for
the
rescue
of
prussia
under
frederic
and
the
humiliation
of
france
under
napoleon
the
brunt
of
the
war
fell
of
course
upon
austria
so
that
as
the
two
nations
were
equally
german
it
had
many
of
the
melancholy
aspects
of
a
civil
war
but
austria
was
catholic
and
prussia
was
protestant
and
had
austria
succeeded
germany
possibly
would
have
been
united
under
an
irresistible
catholic
imperialism
and
there
would
have
been
no
german
empire
whose
capital
is
berlin
the
austrians
in
this
contest
fought
bravely
and
ably
under
prince
carl
and
marshal
daun
who
were
no
mean
competitors
with
the
king
of
prussia
for
military
laurels
but
the
austrians
fought
on
the
offensive
and
the
prussians
on
the
defensive
the
former
were
obliged
to
manoeuvre
on
the
circumference
the
latter
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
the
austrians
in
order
to
recover
silesia
were
compelled
to
cross
high
mountains
whose
passes
were
guarded
by
prussian
soldiers
the
war
began
in
offensive
operations
and
ended
in
defensive
the
most
terrible
enemy
that
frederic
had
next
to
austria
was
russia
ruled
then
by
elizabeth
who
had
the
deepest
sympathy
with
maria
theresa
but
when
she
died
affairs
took
a
new
turn
frederic
was
then
on
the
very
verge
of
ruin
was
as
they
say
about
to
be
bagged
when
the
new
emperor
of
russia
conceived
a
great
personal
admiration
for
his
genius
and
heroism
the
russian
enmity
was
converted
to
friendship
and
the
czar
became
an
ally
instead
of
a
foe
the
aid
which
the
saxons
gave
to
maria
theresa
availed
but
little
the
population
chiefly
and
traditionally
protestant
probably
sympathized
with
prussia
more
than
with
austria
although
the
elector
himself
was
catholic
that
inglorious
monarch
who
resembled
in
his
gallantries
louis
and
in
his
dilettante
tastes
leo
x
he
is
chiefly
known
for
the
number
of
his
concubines
and
his
dresden
gallery
of
pictures
the
aid
which
the
french
gave
was
really
imposing
so
far
as
numbers
make
efficient
armies
but
the
french
were
not
the
warlike
people
in
the
reign
of
louis
xv
that
they
were
under
henry
or
napoleon
bonaparte
they
fought
without
the
stimulus
of
national
enthusiasm
without
a
cause
as
part
of
a
great
machine
they
never
have
been
successful
in
war
without
the
inspiration
of
a
beloved
cause
this
war
had
no
especial
attraction
or
motive
for
them
what
was
it
to
frenchmen
so
absorbed
with
themselves
whether
a
hohenzollern
or
a
hapsburg
reigned
in
germany
hence
the
great
armies
which
the
government
of
france
sent
to
the
aid
of
maria
theresa
were
without
spirit
and
were
not
even
marshalled
by
able
generals
in
fact
the
french
seemed
more
intent
on
crippling
england
than
in
crushing
frederic
the
war
had
immense
complications
though
france
and
england
were
drawn
into
it
yet
both
france
and
england
fought
more
against
each
other
than
for
the
parties
who
had
summoned
them
to
their
rescue
england
was
frederic
ally
but
her
aid
was
not
great
directly
she
did
not
furnish
him
with
many
troops
she
sent
subsidies
instead
which
enabled
him
to
continue
the
contest
but
these
were
not
as
great
as
he
expected
or
had
reason
to
expect
with
all
the
money
he
received
from
walpole
or
pitt
he
was
reduced
to
the
most
desperate
straits
one
thing
was
remarkable
in
that
long
war
of
seven
years
which
strained
every
nerve
and
taxed
every
energy
of
prussia
it
was
carried
on
by
frederic
in
hard
cash
he
did
not
run
in
debt
he
always
had
enough
on
hand
in
coin
to
pay
for
all
expenses
but
then
his
subjects
were
most
severely
taxed
and
the
soldiers
were
poorly
paid
if
the
same
economy
he
used
in
that
war
of
seven
years
had
been
exercised
by
our
government
in
its
late
war
we
should
not
have
had
any
national
debt
at
all
at
the
close
of
the
war
although
we
probably
should
have
suspended
specie
payments
it
would
not
be
easy
or
interesting
to
attempt
to
compress
the
details
of
a
long
war
of
seven
years
in
a
single
lecture
the
records
of
war
have
great
uniformity
devastation
taxes
suffering
loss
of
life
and
of
property
except
by
the
speculators
and
government
agents
the
flight
of
literature
general
demoralization
the
lowering
of
the
tone
of
moral
feeling
the
ascendency
of
unscrupulous
men
the
exaltation
of
military
talents
general
grief
at
the
loss
of
friends
fiendish
exultation
over
victories
alternated
with
depressing
despondency
in
view
of
defeats
the
impoverishment
of
a
nation
on
the
whole
and
the
sickening
conviction
which
fastens
on
the
mind
after
the
first
excitement
is
over
of
a
great
waste
of
life
and
property
for
which
there
is
no
return
and
which
sometimes
a
whole
generation
can
not
restore
nothing
is
so
dearly
purchased
as
the
laurels
of
the
battlefield
nothing
is
so
great
a
delusion
and
folly
as
military
glory
to
the
eye
of
a
christian
or
philosopher
it
is
purchased
by
the
tears
and
blood
of
millions
and
is
rebuked
by
all
that
is
grand
in
human
progress
only
degraded
and
demoralized
peoples
can
ever
rejoice
in
war
and
when
it
is
not
undertaken
for
a
great
necessity
it
fills
the
world
with
bitter
imprecations
it
is
cruel
and
hard
and
unjust
in
its
nature
and
utterly
antagonistic
to
civilization
its
greater
evils
are
indeed
overruled
satan
is
ever
rebuked
and
baffled
by
a
benevolent
providence
but
war
is
always
a
curse
and
a
calamity
in
its
immediate
results
and
in
its
ultimate
results
also
unless
waged
in
defence
of
some
immortal
cause
it
must
be
confessed
war
is
terribly
exciting
the
eyes
of
the
civilized
world
were
concentrated
on
frederic
ii
during
this
memorable
period
and
most
people
anticipated
his
overthrow
they
read
everywhere
of
his
marchings
and
his
sieges
and
battles
his
escapes
and
his
renewed
exertions
from
the
occupation
of
saxony
to
the
battle
of
torgau
in
this
war
he
was
sometimes
beaten
as
at
kolin
but
he
gained
three
memorable
victories
one
over
the
french
at
rossbach
the
second
over
the
austrians
at
luthen
and
the
third
over
the
russians
at
zorndorf
the
most
bloody
of
all
his
battles
and
he
gained
these
victories
by
outflanking
his
attack
being
the
form
of
a
wedge
learned
by
the
example
of
epaminondas
a
device
which
led
to
new
tactics
and
proclaimed
frederic
a
master
of
the
art
of
war
but
in
these
battles
he
simply
showed
himself
to
be
a
great
general
it
was
not
until
his
reverses
came
that
he
showed
himself
a
great
man
or
earned
the
sympathy
which
europe
felt
for
a
humiliated
monarch
putting
forth
herculean
energies
to
save
his
crown
and
kingdom
his
easy
and
great
victories
in
the
first
year
of
the
war
simply
saved
him
from
annihilation
they
were
not
great
enough
to
secure
peace
although
thus
far
he
was
a
conqueror
he
had
no
peace
no
rest
and
but
little
hope
his
enemies
were
so
numerous
and
powerful
that
they
could
send
large
reinforcements
he
could
draw
but
few
in
time
it
was
apparent
that
he
would
be
destroyed
whatever
his
skill
and
bravery
had
not
the
empress
elizabeth
died
he
would
have
been
conquered
and
prostrated
after
his
defeat
at
hochkirch
he
was
obliged
to
dispute
his
ground
inch
by
inch
compelled
to
hide
his
grief
from
his
soldiers
financially
straitened
and
utterly
forlorn
but
for
a
timely
subsidy
from
england
he
would
have
been
desperate
the
fatal
battle
of
kunnersdorf
in
his
fourth
campaign
when
he
lost
twenty
thousand
men
almost
drove
him
to
despair
and
evil
fortune
continued
to
pursue
him
in
his
fifth
campaign
in
which
he
lost
some
of
his
strongest
fortresses
and
silesia
was
opened
to
his
enemies
at
one
time
he
had
only
six
days
provisions
the
world
marvelled
how
he
held
out
then
england
deserted
him
he
made
incredible
exertions
to
avert
his
doom
everlasting
marches
incessant
perils
no
comforts
or
luxuries
as
a
king
only
sorrows
privations
sufferings
enduring
more
labors
than
his
soldiers
with
restless
anxieties
and
blasted
hopes
in
his
despair
and
humiliation
it
is
said
he
recognized
god
almighty
in
his
chastisements
and
misfortunes
apparently
on
the
very
brink
of
destruction
and
with
the
piercing
cries
of
misery
which
reached
his
ears
from
every
corner
of
his
dominions
he
must
at
least
have
recognized
a
retribution
still
his
indomitable
will
remained
his
pride
and
his
never
deserted
him
he
would
have
died
rather
than
have
yielded
up
silesia
until
wrested
from
him
at
last
the
battle
of
torgau
fought
in
the
night
and
the
death
of
the
empress
of
russia
removed
the
overhanging
clouds
and
he
was
enabled
to
contend
with
austria
unassisted
by
france
and
russia
but
if
maria
theresa
could
not
recover
silesia
aided
by
the
great
monarchies
of
europe
what
could
she
do
without
their
aid
so
peace
came
at
last
when
all
parties
were
wearied
and
exhausted
and
frederic
retained
his
stolen
province
at
the
sacrifice
of
one
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
men
and
the
decline
of
one
tenth
of
the
whole
population
of
his
kingdom
and
its
complete
impoverishment
from
which
it
did
not
recover
for
nearly
one
hundred
years
prussia
though
a
powerful
military
state
became
and
remained
one
of
the
poorest
countries
of
europe
and
i
can
remember
when
it
was
rare
to
see
there
except
in
the
houses
of
the
rich
either
a
silver
fork
or
a
silver
spoon
to
say
nothing
of
the
cheap
and
frugal
fare
of
the
great
mass
of
the
people
and
their
comfortless
kind
of
life
with
hardly
any
physical
luxuries
except
tobacco
and
beer
it
is
surprising
how
in
a
poor
country
frederic
could
have
sustained
such
an
exhaustive
war
without
incurring
a
national
debt
perhaps
it
was
not
as
easy
in
those
times
for
kings
and
states
to
run
into
debt
as
it
is
now
one
of
the
great
refinements
of
advancing
civilization
is
that
we
are
permitted
to
bequeath
our
burdens
to
future
generations
time
only
will
show
whether
this
is
the
wisest
course
it
is
certainly
not
a
wise
thing
for
individuals
to
do
he
who
enters
on
the
possession
of
a
heavily
mortgaged
estate
is
an
embarrassed
perhaps
impoverished
man
frederic
at
least
did
not
leave
debts
for
posterity
to
pay
he
preferred
to
pay
as
he
went
along
whatever
were
the
difficulties
the
real
gainer
by
the
war
if
gainer
there
was
was
england
since
she
was
enabled
to
establish
a
maritime
supremacy
and
develop
her
manufacturing
and
mercantile
resources
much
needed
in
her
future
struggles
to
resist
napoleon
she
also
gained
colonial
possessions
a
foothold
in
india
and
the
possession
of
canada
this
war
entangled
europe
and
led
to
great
battles
not
in
germany
merely
but
around
the
world
it
was
during
this
war
when
france
and
england
were
antagonistic
forces
that
the
military
genius
of
washington
was
first
developed
in
america
the
victories
of
clive
and
hastings
soon
after
followed
in
india
the
greatest
loser
in
this
war
was
france
she
lost
provinces
and
military
prestige
the
war
brought
to
light
the
decrepitude
of
the
bourbon
rule
the
marshals
of
france
with
superior
forces
were
disgracefully
defeated
the
war
plunged
france
in
debt
only
to
be
paid
by
a
roaring
conflagration
of
anarchies
the
logical
sequence
of
the
war
was
in
those
discontents
and
taxes
which
prepared
the
way
for
the
french
revolution
a
catastrophe
or
a
new
birth
as
men
differently
view
it
the
effect
of
the
war
on
austria
was
a
loss
of
prestige
the
beginning
of
the
dismemberment
of
the
empire
and
the
revelation
of
internal
weakness
though
maria
theresa
gained
general
sympathy
and
won
great
glory
by
her
vigorous
government
and
the
heroism
of
her
troops
she
was
a
great
loser
besides
the
loss
of
men
and
money
austria
ceased
to
be
the
great
threatening
power
of
europe
from
this
war
england
until
the
close
of
the
career
of
napoleon
was
really
the
most
powerful
state
in
europe
and
became
the
proudest
as
for
prussia
the
principal
transgressor
and
actor
it
is
more
difficult
to
see
the
actual
results
the
immediate
effects
of
the
war
were
national
impoverishment
an
immense
loss
of
life
and
a
fearful
demoralization
the
limits
of
the
kingdom
were
enlarged
and
its
military
and
political
power
was
established
it
became
one
of
the
leading
states
of
continental
europe
surpassed
only
by
austria
russia
and
france
it
led
to
great
standing
armies
and
a
desire
of
aggrandizement
it
made
the
army
the
centre
of
all
power
and
the
basis
of
social
prestige
it
made
frederic
ii
the
great
military
hero
of
that
age
and
perpetuated
his
policy
in
prussia
bismarck
is
the
sequel
and
sequence
of
frederic
it
was
by
aggressive
and
unscrupulous
wars
that
the
romans
were
aggrandized
and
it
was
also
by
the
habits
and
tastes
which
successful
war
created
that
rome
was
ultimately
undermined
the
roman
empire
did
not
last
like
the
chinese
empire
although
at
one
period
it
had
more
glory
and
prestige
so
war
both
strengthens
and
impoverishes
nations
but
i
believe
that
the
violation
of
eternal
principles
of
right
ultimately
brings
a
fearful
penalty
it
may
be
long
delayed
but
it
will
finally
come
as
in
the
sequel
of
the
wicked
wars
of
louis
xiv
and
napoleon
bonaparte
victor
hugo
in
his
history
of
a
great
crime
on
the
principle
of
everlasting
justice
forewarned
napoleon
the
little
of
his
future
reverses
while
nations
and
kingdoms
in
view
of
his
marvellous
successes
hailed
him
as
a
friend
of
civilization
and
hugo
lived
to
see
the
fulfilment
of
his
prophecy
moreover
it
may
be
urged
that
the
prussian
people
ground
down
by
an
absolute
military
despotism
the
mere
tools
of
an
ambitious
king
were
not
responsible
for
the
atrocious
conquests
of
frederic
ii
the
misrule
of
monarchs
does
not
bring
permanent
degradation
on
a
nation
unless
it
shares
the
crimes
of
its
monarch
as
in
the
case
of
the
romans
when
the
leading
idea
of
the
people
was
military
conquest
from
the
very
commencement
of
their
state
the
prussians
in
the
time
of
frederic
were
a
sincere
patriotic
and
religious
people
they
were
simply
enslaved
and
suffered
the
poverty
and
misery
which
were
entailed
by
war
after
frederic
had
escaped
the
perils
of
the
seven
years
war
it
is
surprising
he
should
so
soon
have
become
a
party
to
another
atrocious
crime
the
division
and
dismemberment
of
poland
but
here
both
russia
and
austria
were
also
participants
sarmatia
fell
unwept
without
a
crime
and
i
am
still
more
amazed
that
carlyle
should
cover
up
this
crime
with
his
sophistries
no
man
in
ordinary
life
would
be
justified
in
seizing
his
neighbor
property
because
he
was
weak
and
his
property
was
mismanaged
we
might
as
well
justify
russia
in
attempting
to
seize
turkey
although
such
a
crime
may
be
overruled
in
the
future
good
of
europe
but
carlyle
is
an
englishman
and
the
english
seized
and
conquered
india
because
they
wanted
it
not
because
they
had
a
right
to
it
the
same
laws
which
bind
individuals
also
binds
kings
and
nations
free
nations
from
the
obligations
which
bind
individuals
and
the
world
would
be
an
anarchy
grant
that
poland
was
not
fit
for
this
does
not
justify
its
political
annihilation
the
heart
of
the
world
exclaimed
against
that
crime
at
the
time
and
the
injuries
of
that
unfortunate
state
are
not
yet
forgotten
carlyle
says
the
partition
of
poland
was
an
operation
of
almighty
providence
and
the
eternal
laws
of
nature
a
key
to
his
whole
philosophy
which
means
if
it
means
anything
that
as
great
fishes
swallow
up
the
small
ones
and
wild
beasts
prey
upon
each
other
and
eagles
and
vultures
devour
other
birds
it
is
all
right
for
powerful
nations
to
absorb
the
weak
ones
as
the
romans
did
might
does
not
make
right
by
the
eternal
decrees
of
god
almighty
written
in
the
bible
and
on
the
consciences
of
mankind
politicians
whose
primal
law
is
expediency
may
justify
such
acts
as
public
robbery
for
they
are
political
jesuits
always
were
always
will
be
and
even
calm
statesmen
looking
on
the
overruling
of
events
may
palliate
but
to
enlightened
christians
there
is
only
one
law
do
unto
others
as
ye
would
that
they
should
do
unto
you
nor
can
christian
civilization
reach
an
exalted
plane
until
it
is
in
harmony
with
the
eternal
laws
of
god
carlyle
glibly
speaks
of
almighty
providence
favoring
robbery
here
he
utters
a
falsehood
and
i
do
not
hesitate
to
say
it
great
as
is
his
authority
god
says
thou
shalt
not
steal
thou
shalt
not
covet
anything
which
is
thy
neighbor
for
he
is
a
jealous
god
visiting
the
sins
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
to
the
third
and
fourth
generation
we
must
set
aside
the
whole
authority
of
divine
revelation
to
justify
any
crime
openly
or
secretly
committed
the
prosperity
of
nations
in
the
long
run
is
based
on
righteousness
not
on
injustice
cruelty
and
selfishness
it
can
not
be
denied
that
frederic
well
managed
his
stolen
property
he
was
a
man
of
ability
of
enlightened
views
of
indefatigable
industry
and
of
an
iron
will
i
would
as
soon
deny
that
cromwell
did
not
well
govern
the
kingdom
which
he
had
seized
on
the
plea
of
revolutionary
necessity
and
the
welfare
of
england
for
he
also
was
able
and
wise
but
what
was
the
fruit
of
cromwell
usurpation
a
hideous
reaction
the
return
of
the
stuarts
the
dissipation
of
his
visionary
dreams
and
if
the
states
which
frederic
seized
and
the
empire
he
had
founded
in
blood
and
carnage
had
been
as
well
prepared
for
liberty
as
england
was
the
consequences
of
his
ambition
might
have
been
far
different
but
frederic
did
not
so
much
aim
at
the
development
of
national
resources
the
aim
of
all
immortal
statesmen
as
at
the
growth
and
establishment
of
a
military
power
he
filled
his
kingdom
and
provinces
with
fortresses
and
camps
and
standing
armies
he
cemented
a
military
monarchy
as
a
wise
executive
ruler
the
king
of
prussia
enforced
law
and
order
was
economical
in
his
expenditures
and
kept
up
a
rigid
discipline
even
rewarded
merit
and
was
friendly
to
learning
and
he
showed
many
interesting
personal
qualities
for
i
do
not
wish
to
make
him
out
a
monster
only
as
a
great
man
who
did
wicked
things
and
things
which
even
cemented
for
the
time
the
power
of
prussia
he
was
frugal
and
unostentatious
like
charlemagne
he
associated
with
learned
men
he
loved
music
and
literature
and
he
showed
an
amazing
fortitude
and
patience
in
adversity
which
called
out
universal
admiration
he
had
a
great
insight
into
shams
was
rarely
imposed
upon
and
was
scrupulous
and
honest
in
his
dealings
as
an
individual
he
was
also
a
fascinating
man
when
he
unbent
was
affable
intelligent
accessible
and
unstilted
he
was
an
admirable
talker
and
a
tolerable
author
he
always
sympathized
with
intellectual
excellence
he
surrounded
himself
with
great
men
in
all
departments
he
had
good
taste
and
a
severe
dignity
and
despised
vulgar
people
had
no
craving
for
fast
horses
and
held
no
intercourse
with
hostlers
and
gamblers
even
if
these
gamblers
had
the
respectable
name
of
brokers
he
punished
all
public
thieves
so
that
his
administration
at
least
was
dignified
and
respectable
and
secured
the
respect
of
europe
and
the
admiration
of
men
of
ability
the
great
warrior
was
also
a
great
statesman
and
never
made
himself
ridiculous
never
degraded
his
position
and
powers
and
could
admire
and
detect
a
man
of
genius
even
when
hidden
from
the
world
he
was
a
tiberius
but
not
a
nero
fiddling
over
national
calamities
and
surrounding
himself
with
buffoons
and
idiots
but
here
his
virtues
ended
he
was
cold
selfish
dissembling
ungrateful
ambitious
unscrupulous
without
faith
in
either
god
or
man
so
sceptical
in
religion
that
he
was
almost
an
atheist
he
was
a
disobedient
son
a
heartless
husband
a
capricious
friend
and
a
selfish
while
he
was
the
friend
of
literary
men
he
patronized
those
who
were
infidel
in
their
creed
he
was
not
a
religious
persecutor
because
he
regarded
all
religions
as
equally
false
and
equally
useful
he
was
social
among
convivial
and
learned
friends
but
cared
little
for
women
or
female
society
his
latter
years
though
dignified
and
quiet
an
idol
in
all
military
circles
with
an
immense
fame
and
surrounded
with
every
pleasure
and
luxury
at
were
still
sad
and
gloomy
like
those
of
most
great
men
whose
leading
principle
of
life
was
vanity
and
egotism
like
those
of
solomon
charles
and
louis
xiv
he
heard
the
distant
rumblings
if
he
did
not
live
to
see
the
lurid
fires
of
the
french
revolution
he
had
been
deceived
in
voltaire
but
he
could
not
mistake
the
logical
sequence
of
the
ideas
of
rousseau
those
blasting
ideas
which
would
sweep
away
all
feudal
institutions
and
all
irresponsible
tyrannies
when
mirabeau
visited
him
he
was
a
quaking
suspicious
irritable
capricious
unhappy
old
man
though
adored
by
his
soldiers
to
the
last
for
those
were
the
only
people
he
ever
loved
those
who
were
willing
to
die
for
him
those
who
built
up
his
throne
and
when
he
died
i
suppose
he
was
sincerely
lamented
by
his
army
and
his
generals
and
his
nobility
for
with
him
began
the
greatness
of
prussia
as
a
military
power
so
far
as
a
life
devoted
to
the
military
and
political
aggrandizement
of
a
country
makes
a
man
a
patriot
frederic
the
great
will
receive
the
plaudits
of
those
men
who
worship
success
and
who
forget
the
enormity
of
unscrupulous
crimes
in
the
outward
glory
which
immediately
resulted
yea
possibly
of
contemplative
statesmen
who
see
in
the
rise
of
a
new
power
an
instrument
of
the
almighty
for
some
inscrutable
end
to
me
his
character
and
deeds
have
no
fascination
any
more
than
the
fortunate
career
of
some
one
of
our
modern
millionnaires
would
have
to
one
who
took
no
interest
in
finance
it
was
doubtless
grateful
to
the
dying
king
of
prussia
to
hear
the
plaudits
of
his
idolaters
as
he
stood
on
the
hither
shores
of
eternity
but
his
view
of
the
spectators
as
they
lined
those
shores
must
have
been
soon
lost
sight
of
and
their
cheering
and
triumphant
voices
unheard
and
disregarded
as
the
bark
in
which
he
sailed
alone
put
forth
on
the
unknown
ocean
to
meet
the
eternal
judge
of
the
living
and
the
dead
we
leave
now
the
man
who
won
so
great
a
fame
to
consider
briefly
his
influence
in
two
respects
it
seems
to
me
it
has
been
decided
and
impressive
in
the
first
place
he
gave
an
impulse
to
rationalistic
inquiries
in
germany
and
many
there
are
who
think
this
was
a
good
thing
he
made
it
fashionable
to
be
cynical
and
doubtful
being
ashamed
of
his
own
language
and
preferring
the
french
he
encouraged
the
current
and
popular
french
literature
which
in
his
day
under
the
guidance
of
voltaire
was
materialistic
and
deistical
he
embraced
a
philosophy
which
looked
to
secondary
rather
than
primal
causes
which
scouted
any
revelations
that
could
not
be
explained
by
reason
or
reconciled
with
scientific
theories
that
false
philosophy
which
intoxicated
franklin
and
jefferson
as
well
as
hume
and
gibbon
and
which
finally
culminated
in
diderot
and
the
philosophy
which
became
fashionable
in
german
universities
and
whose
nearest
approach
was
that
of
the
exploded
epicureanism
of
the
ancients
under
the
patronage
of
the
infidel
court
the
universities
of
germany
became
filled
with
rationalistic
professors
and
the
pulpits
with
dead
and
formal
divines
so
that
the
glorious
old
lutheranism
of
prussia
became
the
coldest
and
most
lifeless
of
all
the
forms
which
protestantism
ever
assumed
doubtless
great
critics
and
scholars
arose
under
the
stimulus
of
that
unbounded
religious
speculation
which
the
king
encouraged
but
they
employed
their
learning
in
pulling
down
rather
than
supporting
the
pillars
of
the
ancient
orthodoxy
and
so
rapidly
did
rationalism
spread
in
northern
germany
that
it
changed
its
great
lights
into
who
spurned
what
was
revealed
unless
it
was
in
accordance
with
their
speculations
and
sweeping
criticism
i
need
not
dwell
on
this
undisguised
and
blazing
fact
on
the
rationalism
which
became
the
fashion
in
germany
and
which
spread
so
disastrously
over
other
countries
penetrating
even
into
the
inmost
sanctuaries
of
theological
instruction
all
this
may
be
progress
but
to
my
mind
it
tended
to
extinguish
the
light
of
faith
and
fill
the
seats
of
learning
with
cynics
and
unbelieving
critics
it
was
bad
enough
to
destroy
the
bodies
of
men
in
a
heartless
war
it
was
worse
to
nourish
those
principles
which
poisoned
the
soul
and
spread
doubt
and
disguised
infidelities
among
the
learned
classes
but
the
influence
of
frederic
was
seen
in
a
more
marked
manner
in
the
inauguration
of
a
national
policy
directed
chiefly
to
military
aggrandizement
if
there
ever
was
a
purely
military
monarchy
it
is
prussia
and
this
kingdom
has
been
to
europe
what
sparta
was
to
greece
all
the
successors
of
frederic
have
followed
out
his
policy
with
singular
tenacity
all
their
habits
and
associations
have
been
military
the
army
has
been
the
centre
of
their
pride
ambition
and
hope
they
have
made
their
country
one
vast
military
camp
they
have
exempted
no
classes
from
military
services
they
have
honored
and
exalted
the
army
more
than
any
other
interest
the
principal
people
of
the
land
are
generals
the
resources
of
the
kingdom
are
expended
in
standing
armies
and
these
are
a
perpetual
menace
a
network
of
military
machinery
controls
all
other
pursuits
and
interests
the
peasant
is
a
military
slave
the
student
of
the
university
can
be
summoned
to
a
military
camp
precedence
in
rank
is
given
to
military
men
over
merchant
princes
over
learned
professors
over
distinguished
jurists
the
genius
of
the
nation
has
been
directed
to
the
perfection
of
military
discipline
and
military
weapons
the
government
is
always
prepared
for
war
and
has
been
rarely
averse
to
it
it
has
ever
been
ready
to
seize
a
province
or
pick
a
quarrel
the
late
war
with
france
was
as
much
the
fault
of
prussia
as
of
the
government
of
napoleon
the
great
idea
of
prussia
is
military
aggrandizement
it
is
no
longer
a
small
kingdom
but
a
great
empire
more
powerful
than
either
austria
or
france
it
believes
in
new
annexations
until
all
germany
shall
be
united
under
a
prussian
kaiser
what
rome
became
prussia
aspires
to
be
the
spirit
the
animus
of
prussia
is
military
power
travel
in
that
kingdom
everywhere
are
soldiers
military
schools
camps
arsenals
fortresses
reviews
and
this
military
spirit
evident
during
the
last
hundred
years
has
made
the
military
classes
arrogant
austere
mechanical
contemptuous
this
spirit
pervades
the
nation
it
despises
other
nations
as
much
as
france
did
in
the
last
century
or
england
after
the
wars
of
napoleon
but
the
great
peculiarity
of
this
military
spirit
is
seen
in
the
large
standing
armies
which
dry
up
the
resources
of
the
nation
and
make
war
a
perpetual
necessity
at
least
a
perpetual
fear
it
may
be
urged
that
these
armies
are
necessary
to
the
protection
of
the
state
that
if
they
were
disbanded
then
france
or
some
other
power
would
arise
and
avenge
their
injuries
and
cripple
a
state
so
potent
to
do
evil
it
may
be
so
but
still
the
evils
generated
by
these
armies
must
be
fatal
to
liberty
and
antagonistic
to
those
peaceful
energies
which
produce
the
highest
civilization
they
are
fatal
to
the
peaceful
virtues
the
great
schiller
has
said
there
exists
an
higher
than
the
warrior
excellence
great
deeds
of
violence
adventures
wild
and
wonders
of
the
moment
these
are
not
they
which
generate
the
high
the
blissful
and
the
enduring
majesty
i
do
not
disdain
the
virtues
which
are
developed
by
war
but
great
virtues
are
seldom
developed
by
war
unless
the
war
is
stimulated
by
love
of
liberty
or
the
conservation
of
immortal
privileges
worth
more
than
the
fortunes
or
the
lives
of
men
a
nation
incapable
of
being
roused
in
great
necessities
soon
becomes
insignificant
and
degenerate
like
greece
when
it
was
incorporated
with
the
roman
empire
but
i
have
no
admiration
of
a
nation
perpetually
arming
and
perpetually
seeking
political
aggrandizement
when
the
great
ends
of
civilization
are
lost
sight
of
and
this
is
what
frederic
sought
and
his
successors
who
cherished
his
ideas
the
legacy
he
bequeathed
to
the
world
was
not
emancipating
ideas
but
the
policy
of
military
aggrandizement
and
yet
has
civilization
no
higher
aim
than
the
imitation
of
the
ancient
romans
can
nations
progressively
become
strong
by
ignoring
the
spirit
of
christianity
is
a
nation
only
to
thrive
by
adopting
the
sentiments
peculiar
to
robbers
and
bandits
i
know
that
prussia
has
not
neglected
education
or
science
or
industrial
energy
but
these
have
been
made
subservient
to
military
aims
the
highest
civilization
is
that
which
best
develops
the
virtues
of
the
heart
and
the
energies
of
the
mind
on
these
the
strength
of
man
is
based
it
may
be
necessary
for
prussia
in
the
complicated
relations
of
governments
and
in
view
of
possible
dangers
to
sustain
vast
standing
armies
but
the
larger
these
are
the
more
do
they
provoke
other
nations
to
do
the
same
and
to
eat
out
the
vitals
of
national
wealth
that
nation
is
the
greatest
which
seeks
to
reduce
rather
than
augment
forces
which
prey
upon
its
resources
and
which
are
a
perpetual
menace
and
hence
the
vast
standing
armies
which
conquerors
seek
to
maintain
are
not
an
aid
to
civilization
but
on
the
other
hand
tend
to
destroy
it
unless
by
civilization
and
national
prosperity
are
meant
an
policy
of
military
aggrandizement
by
which
weaker
and
unoffending
states
may
be
gradually
absorbed
by
irresistible
despotism
like
that
of
the
romans
whose
final
and
logical
development
proves
fatal
to
all
other
nationalities
and
liberties
yea
to
literature
and
art
and
science
and
industry
the
extinction
of
which
is
the
moral
death
of
an
empire
however
grand
and
however
boastful
only
to
be
succeeded
by
new
creations
through
the
fires
of
successive
wars
and
hateful
anarchies
in
one
point
and
one
alone
i
see
the
providence
which
permitted
the
military
aggrandizement
to
which
frederic
and
his
successors
aimed
and
that
is
in
furnishing
a
barrier
to
the
future
conquests
of
a
more
barbarous
people
i
mean
the
russians
even
as
the
conquests
of
charlemagne
presented
a
barrier
to
the
future
irruptions
of
barbarous
tribes
on
his
northern
frontier
russia
that
rude
demoralized
slavonic
empire
can
not
conquer
europe
until
it
has
first
destroyed
the
political
and
military
power
of
germany
united
and
patriotic
germany
can
keep
at
present
the
russians
at
bay
and
direct
the
stream
of
invasion
to
the
east
rather
than
the
south
so
that
europe
will
not
become
either
cossack
or
french
as
napoleon
predicted
in
this
light
the
military
genius
and
power
of
germany
which
frederic
did
so
much
to
develop
may
be
designed
for
the
protection
of
european
civilization
and
the
protestant
religion
but
i
will
not
speculate
on
the
aims
of
providence
or
the
evil
to
be
overruled
for
good
with
my
limited
vision
i
can
only
present
facts
and
their
immediate
consequences
i
can
only
deduce
the
moral
truths
which
are
logically
to
be
drawn
from
a
career
of
wicked
ambition
these
truths
are
a
part
of
that
moral
wisdom
which
experience
confirms
and
which
alone
should
be
the
guiding
lesson
to
all
statesmen
and
all
empires
let
us
pursue
the
right
and
leave
the
consequences
to
him
who
rules
the
fate
of
war
and
guides
the
nations
to
the
promised
period
when
men
shall
beat
their
