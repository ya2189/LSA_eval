introduction
after
the
great
war
it
is
difficult
to
point
out
a
single
nation
that
is
happy
but
this
has
come
out
of
the
war
that
there
is
not
a
single
nation
outside
india
that
is
not
either
free
or
striving
to
be
free
it
is
said
that
we
too
are
on
the
road
to
freedom
that
it
is
better
to
be
on
the
certain
though
slow
course
of
gradual
unfoldment
of
freedom
than
to
take
the
troubled
and
dangerous
path
of
revolution
whether
peaceful
or
violent
and
that
the
new
reforms
are
a
house
to
freedom
the
new
constitution
granted
to
india
keeps
all
the
military
forces
both
in
the
direction
and
in
the
financial
control
entirely
outside
the
scope
of
responsibility
to
the
people
of
india
what
does
this
mean
it
means
that
the
revenues
of
india
are
spent
away
on
what
the
nation
does
not
want
but
after
the
complications
and
the
fresh
asiatic
additions
to
british
imperial
spheres
of
action
this
indian
military
servitude
is
a
clear
danger
to
national
interests
the
new
constitution
gives
no
scope
for
retrenchment
and
therefore
no
scope
for
measures
of
social
reform
except
by
fresh
taxation
the
heavy
burden
of
which
on
the
poor
will
outweigh
all
the
advantages
of
any
reforms
it
maintains
all
the
existing
foreign
services
and
the
cost
of
the
administrative
machinery
high
as
it
already
is
is
further
increased
the
reformed
constitution
keeps
all
the
fundamental
liberties
of
person
property
press
and
association
completely
under
bureaucratic
control
all
those
laws
which
give
to
the
irresponsible
officers
of
the
executive
government
of
india
absolute
powers
to
override
the
popular
will
are
still
unrepealed
in
spite
of
the
tragic
price
paid
in
the
punjab
for
demonstrating
the
danger
of
unrestrained
power
in
the
hands
of
a
foreign
bureaucracy
and
the
inhumanity
of
spirit
by
which
tyranny
in
a
panic
will
seek
to
save
itself
we
stand
just
where
we
were
before
at
the
mercy
of
the
executive
in
respect
of
all
our
fundamental
liberties
not
only
is
despotism
intact
in
the
law
but
unparalleled
crimes
and
cruelties
against
the
people
have
been
encouraged
and
even
after
boastful
admissions
and
clearest
proofs
left
unpunished
the
spirit
of
unrepentant
cruelty
has
thus
been
allowed
to
permeate
the
whole
administration
the
mussalman
agony
to
understand
our
present
condition
it
is
not
enough
to
realise
the
general
political
servitude
we
should
add
to
it
the
reality
and
the
extent
of
the
injury
inflicted
by
britain
on
islam
and
thereby
on
the
mussalmans
of
india
the
articles
of
islamic
faith
which
it
is
necessary
to
understand
in
order
to
realise
why
mussalman
india
which
was
once
so
loyal
is
now
so
strongly
moved
to
the
contrary
are
easily
set
out
and
understood
every
religion
should
be
interpreted
by
the
professors
of
that
religion
the
sentiments
and
religious
ideas
of
muslims
founded
on
the
traditions
of
long
generations
can
not
be
altered
now
by
logic
or
cosmopolitanism
as
others
understand
it
such
an
attempt
is
the
more
unreasonable
when
it
is
made
not
even
as
a
bonafide
and
independent
effort
of
proselytising
logic
or
reason
but
only
to
justify
a
treaty
entered
into
for
political
and
worldly
purposes
the
khalifa
is
the
authority
that
is
entrusted
with
the
duty
of
defending
islam
he
is
the
successor
to
muhammad
and
the
agent
of
god
on
earth
according
to
islamic
tradition
he
must
possess
sufficient
temporal
power
effectively
to
protect
islam
against
powers
and
he
should
be
one
elected
or
accepted
by
the
mussalman
world
the
is
the
area
bounded
by
the
red
sea
the
arabian
sea
the
persian
gulf
and
the
waters
of
the
tigris
and
the
euphrates
it
is
the
sacred
home
of
islam
and
the
centre
towards
which
islam
throughout
the
world
turns
in
prayer
according
to
the
religious
injunctions
of
the
mussalmans
this
entire
area
should
always
be
under
muslim
control
its
scientific
border
being
believed
to
be
a
protection
for
the
integrity
of
islamic
life
and
faith
every
mussalman
throughout
the
world
is
enjoined
to
sacrifice
his
all
if
necessary
for
preserving
the
under
complete
muslim
control
the
sacred
places
of
islam
should
be
in
the
possession
of
the
khalifa
they
should
not
merely
be
free
for
the
entry
of
the
mussalmans
of
the
world
by
the
grace
or
the
license
of
powers
but
should
be
the
possession
and
property
of
islam
in
the
fullest
degree
it
is
a
religions
obligation
on
every
mussalman
to
go
forth
and
help
the
khalifa
in
every
possible
way
where
his
unaided
efforts
in
the
defence
of
the
khilifat
have
failed
the
grievance
of
the
indian
mussalmans
is
that
a
government
that
pretends
to
protect
and
spread
peace
and
happiness
among
them
has
no
right
to
ignore
or
set
aside
these
articles
of
their
cherished
faith
according
to
the
peace
treaty
imposed
on
the
nominal
government
at
constantinople
the
khalifa
far
from
having
the
temporal
authority
or
power
needed
to
protect
islam
is
a
prisoner
in
his
own
city
he
is
to
have
no
real
fighting
force
army
or
navy
and
the
financial
control
over
his
own
territories
is
vested
in
other
governments
his
capital
is
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
his
possessions
by
an
intervening
permanent
military
occupation
it
is
needless
to
say
that
under
these
conditions
he
is
absolutely
incapable
of
protecting
islam
as
the
mussulmans
of
the
world
understand
it
the
is
split
up
a
great
part
of
it
given
to
powerful
powers
the
remnant
left
with
petty
chiefs
dominated
all
round
by
governments
the
holy
places
of
islam
are
all
taken
out
of
the
khalifa
kingdom
some
left
in
the
possession
of
minor
muslim
chiefs
of
arabia
entirely
dependent
on
european
control
and
some
relegated
to
states
in
a
word
the
mussalman
free
choice
of
a
khalifa
such
as
islamic
tradition
defines
is
made
an
unreality
the
hindu
dharma
the
age
of
misunderstanding
and
mutual
warfare
among
religions
is
gone
if
india
has
a
mission
of
its
own
to
the
world
it
is
to
establish
the
unity
and
the
truth
of
all
religions
this
unity
is
established
by
mutual
help
and
understanding
between
the
various
religions
it
has
come
as
a
rare
privilege
to
the
hindus
in
the
fulfilment
of
this
mission
of
india
to
stand
up
in
defence
of
islam
against
the
onslaught
of
the
of
the
military
powers
of
the
west
the
dharma
of
hinduism
in
this
respect
is
placed
beyond
all
doubt
by
the
bhagavat
gita
those
who
are
the
votaries
of
other
gods
and
worship
them
with
faith
even
they
o
kaunteya
worship
me
alone
though
not
as
the
shastra
requires
ix
whoever
being
devoted
wishes
in
perfect
faith
to
worship
a
particular
form
of
such
a
one
i
maintain
the
same
faith
unshaken
vii
hinduism
will
realise
its
fullest
beauty
when
in
the
fulfilment
of
this
cardinal
tenet
its
followers
offer
themselves
as
sacrifice
for
the
protection
of
the
faith
of
their
brothers
the
mussalmans
if
hindus
and
mussalmans
attain
the
height
of
courage
and
sacrifice
that
is
needed
for
this
battle
on
behalf
of
islam
against
the
greed
of
the
west
a
victory
will
be
won
not
alone
for
islam
but
for
christianity
itself
militarism
has
robbed
the
crucified
god
of
his
name
and
his
very
cross
and
the
world
has
been
mistaking
it
to
be
christianity
after
the
battle
of
islam
is
won
islam
and
hinduism
together
can
emancipate
christianity
itself
from
the
lust
for
power
and
wealth
which
have
strangled
it
now
and
the
true
christianity
of
the
gospels
will
be
established
this
battle
of
with
its
suffering
and
peaceful
withdrawal
of
service
will
once
for
all
establish
its
superiority
over
the
power
of
brute
force
and
unlimited
slaughter
what
a
glorious
privilege
it
is
to
play
our
part
in
this
history
of
the
world
when
hinduism
and
christianity
will
unite
on
behalf
of
islam
and
in
that
strife
of
mutual
love
and
support
each
religion
will
attain
its
own
truest
shape
and
beauty
an
enduring
treaty
swaraj
for
india
has
two
great
problems
one
internal
and
the
other
external
how
can
hindus
and
mussalmans
so
different
from
each
other
form
a
strong
and
united
nation
governing
themselves
peacefully
this
was
the
question
for
years
and
no
one
could
believe
that
the
two
communities
could
suffer
for
each
other
till
the
miracle
was
actually
worked
the
khilafat
has
solved
the
problem
by
the
magic
of
suffering
each
has
truly
touched
and
captured
the
other
heart
and
the
nation
now
is
strong
and
united
not
internal
strength
and
unity
alone
has
the
khilafat
brought
to
india
the
great
block
in
the
way
of
indian
aspiration
for
full
freedom
was
the
problem
of
external
defence
how
is
india
left
to
herself
defend
her
frontiers
against
her
mussalman
neighbours
none
but
emasculated
nations
would
accept
such
difficulties
and
responsibilities
as
an
answer
to
the
demand
for
freedom
it
is
only
a
people
whose
mentality
has
been
perverted
that
can
soothe
itself
with
the
domination
by
one
race
from
a
distant
country
as
a
preventative
against
the
aggression
of
another
a
permanent
and
natural
neighbour
instead
of
developing
strength
to
protect
ourselves
against
those
near
whom
we
are
permanently
placed
a
feeling
of
incurable
impotence
has
been
generated
two
strong
and
brave
nations
can
live
side
by
side
strengthening
each
other
through
enforcing
constant
vigilance
and
maintain
in
full
vigour
each
its
own
national
strength
unity
patriotism
and
resources
if
a
nation
wishes
to
be
respected
by
its
neighbours
it
has
to
develop
and
enter
into
honourable
treaties
these
are
the
only
natural
conditions
of
national
liberty
but
not
a
surrender
to
distant
military
powers
to
save
oneself
from
one
neighbours
the
khilafat
has
solved
the
problem
of
distrust
of
asiatic
neighbours
out
of
our
future
the
indian
struggle
for
the
freedom
of
islam
has
brought
about
a
more
lasting
and
a
more
binding
treaty
between
the
people
of
india
and
the
people
of
the
mussalman
states
around
it
than
all
the
ententes
and
treaties
among
the
governments
of
europe
no
wars
of
aggression
are
possible
where
the
common
people
on
the
two
sides
have
become
grateful
friends
the
faith
of
the
mussulman
is
a
better
sanction
than
the
seal
of
the
european
diplomats
and
plenipotentiaries
not
only
has
this
great
friendship
between
india
and
the
mussulman
states
around
it
removed
for
all
time
the
fear
of
mussulman
aggression
from
outside
but
it
has
erected
round
india
a
solid
wall
of
defence
against
all
aggression
from
beyond
against
all
greed
from
europe
russia
or
elsewhere
no
secret
diplomacy
could
establish
a
better
or
a
stronger
federation
than
what
this
open
and
treaty
between
islam
and
india
has
established
the
indian
support
of
the
khilafat
has
as
if
by
a
magic
wand
converted
what
was
once
the
terror
for
europe
into
a
solid
wall
of
friendship
and
defence
for
india
the
british
connection
every
nation
like
every
individual
is
born
free
absolute
freedom
is
the
birthright
of
every
people
the
only
limitations
are
those
which
a
people
may
place
over
themselves
the
british
connection
is
invaluable
as
long
as
it
is
a
defence
against
any
worse
connection
sought
to
be
imposed
by
violence
but
it
is
only
a
means
to
an
end
not
a
mandate
of
providence
of
nature
the
alliance
of
neighbours
born
of
suffering
for
each
other
sake
for
ends
that
purify
those
that
suffer
is
necessarily
a
more
natural
and
more
enduring
bond
than
one
that
has
resulted
from
pure
greed
on
the
one
side
and
weakness
on
the
other
where
such
a
natural
and
enduring
alliance
has
been
accomplished
among
asiatic
peoples
and
not
only
between
the
respective
governments
it
may
truly
be
felt
to
be
more
valuable
than
the
british
connection
itself
after
that
connection
has
denied
freedom
or
equality
and
even
justice
the
alternative
is
violence
or
total
surrender
the
only
choice
open
to
any
people
to
whom
freedom
or
justice
is
denied
violence
at
a
time
when
the
whole
world
has
learnt
from
bitter
experience
the
futility
of
violence
is
unworthy
of
a
country
whose
ancient
people
privilege
it
was
to
see
this
truth
long
ago
violence
may
rid
a
nation
of
its
foreign
masters
but
will
only
enslave
it
from
inside
no
nation
can
really
be
free
which
is
at
the
mercy
of
its
army
and
its
military
heroes
if
a
people
rely
for
freedom
on
its
soldiers
the
soldiers
will
rule
the
country
not
the
people
till
the
recent
awakening
of
the
workers
of
europe
this
was
the
only
freedom
which
the
powers
of
europe
really
enjoyed
true
freedom
can
exist
only
when
those
who
produce
not
those
who
destroy
or
know
only
to
live
on
other
labour
are
the
masters
even
were
violence
the
true
road
to
freedom
is
violence
possible
to
a
nation
which
has
been
emasculated
and
deprived
of
all
weapons
and
the
whole
world
is
hopelessly
in
advance
of
all
our
possibilities
in
the
manufacture
and
the
wielding
of
weapons
of
destruction
submission
or
withdrawal
of
is
the
real
and
only
alternative
before
india
submission
to
injustice
puts
on
the
tempting
garb
of
peace
and
gradual
progress
but
there
is
no
surer
way
to
death
than
submission
to
wrong
the
fifth
upaya
our
ancients
classified
the
arts
of
conquest
into
four
sama
dana
uheda
and
danda
a
fifth
upuya
was
recognised
sometimes
by
our
ancients
which
they
called
it
is
this
that
is
placed
by
mahatma
gandhi
before
the
people
of
india
in
the
form
of
as
an
alternative
besides
violence
to
surrender
where
in
any
case
negotiations
have
failed
and
the
enemy
is
neither
corruptible
nor
incapable
of
being
divided
and
a
resort
to
violence
has
failed
or
would
certainly
be
futile
the
method
of
remains
to
be
applied
to
the
case
indeed
when
the
very
existence
of
the
power
we
seek
to
defeat
really
depends
on
our
continuous
with
it
and
where
our
its
very
life
our
or
is
the
most
natural
and
most
effective
expedient
that
we
can
employ
to
bend
it
to
our
will
no
englishman
believes
that
his
nation
can
rule
or
keep
india
for
a
day
unless
the
people
of
india
actively
to
maintain
that
rule
whether
the
be
given
willingly
or
through
ignorance
cupidity
habit
or
fear
the
withdrawal
of
that
means
impossibility
of
foreign
rule
in
india
some
of
us
may
not
realise
this
but
those
who
govern
us
have
long
ago
known
and
are
now
keenly
alive
to
this
truth
the
active
assistance
of
the
people
of
this
country
in
the
supply
of
the
money
men
and
knowledge
of
the
languages
customs
and
laws
of
the
land
is
the
of
the
continuous
life
of
the
foreign
administration
indeed
the
circumstances
of
british
rule
in
this
country
are
such
that
but
for
a
double
supply
of
on
the
part
of
the
governed
it
must
have
broken
down
long
ago
any
system
of
race
domination
is
unnatural
and
can
be
kept
up
only
by
active
coercion
through
a
public
service
invested
with
large
powers
however
much
it
may
be
helped
by
the
perversion
of
mentality
shaping
the
education
of
the
youth
of
the
country
the
foreign
recruited
service
must
necessarily
be
very
highly
paid
this
creates
a
wrong
standard
for
the
indian
recruited
officials
also
military
expenditure
has
to
cover
not
only
the
needs
of
defence
against
foreign
aggression
but
also
the
possibilities
of
internal
unrest
and
rebellion
police
charges
have
to
go
beyond
the
prevention
and
deletion
of
ordinary
crime
for
though
this
would
be
the
only
expenditure
over
the
police
of
a
people
where
any
nation
governs
another
a
large
chapter
of
artificial
crime
has
to
be
added
to
the
penal
code
and
the
work
of
the
police
extended
accordingly
the
military
and
public
organisations
must
also
be
such
as
not
only
to
result
in
outside
efficiency
but
also
at
the
same
time
guarantee
internal
impotency
this
is
to
be
achieved
by
the
adjustment
and
careful
admixture
of
officers
and
units
from
different
races
all
this
can
be
and
is
maintained
only
by
extra
cost
and
on
the
part
of
the
people
the
slightest
withdrawal
of
assistance
must
put
such
machinery
out
of
gear
this
is
the
basis
of
the
programme
of
progressive
non
violent
that
has
been
adopted
by
the
national
congress
some
objections
the
powerful
character
of
the
measure
however
leads
some
to
object
to
because
of
that
very
reason
striking
as
it
does
at
the
very
root
of
government
in
india
they
fear
that
must
lead
to
anarchy
and
that
the
remedy
is
worse
than
the
disease
this
is
an
objection
arising
out
of
insufficient
allowance
for
human
nature
it
is
assumed
that
the
british
people
will
allow
their
connection
with
india
to
cease
rather
than
remedy
the
wrongs
for
which
we
seek
justice
if
this
assumption
be
correct
no
doubt
it
must
lead
to
separation
and
possibly
also
anarchy
for
a
time
if
the
operatives
in
a
factory
have
grievances
negotiations
having
failed
a
strike
would
on
a
similar
argument
be
never
admissible
unyielding
obstinacy
being
presumed
it
must
end
in
the
closing
down
of
the
factory
and
break
up
of
the
men
but
if
in
out
of
a
hundred
cases
it
is
not
the
case
that
strikes
end
in
this
manner
it
is
more
unlikely
that
instead
of
righting
the
manifest
wrongs
that
india
complains
about
the
british
people
will
value
their
indian
dominion
so
low
as
to
prefer
to
allow
us
to
up
to
the
point
of
separation
it
would
be
a
totally
false
reading
of
british
character
and
british
history
but
if
such
wicked
obstinacy
be
ultimately
shown
by
a
government
far
be
it
from
us
to
prefer
peace
at
the
price
of
abject
surrender
to
wrong
there
is
no
anarchy
greater
than
the
moral
anarchy
of
surrender
to
unrepentant
wrong
we
may
however
be
certain
that
if
we
show
the
strength
and
unity
necessary
for
long
before
we
progress
with
it
far
we
shall
have
developed
true
order
and
true
wherein
there
is
no
place
for
anarchy
another
fear
sometimes
expressed
that
if
were
to
succeed
the
british
would
have
to
go
leaving
us
unable
to
defend
ourselves
against
foreign
aggression
if
we
have
the
the
patriotism
the
tenacious
purpose
and
the
power
of
organisation
that
are
necessary
to
drive
the
british
out
from
their
entrenched
position
no
lesser
foreign
power
will
dare
after
that
undertake
the
futile
task
of
conquering
or
enslaving
us
it
is
sometimes
said
that
is
negative
and
destructive
of
the
advantages
which
a
stable
government
has
conferred
on
us
that
is
negative
is
merely
a
with
the
government
means
greater
among
ourselves
greater
mutual
dependence
among
the
many
different
castes
and
classes
of
our
country
is
not
mere
negation
it
will
lead
to
the
recovery
of
the
lost
art
of
among
ourselves
long
dependence
on
an
outside
government
which
by
its
interference
suppressed
or
prevented
the
consequences
of
our
differences
has
made
us
forget
the
duty
of
mutual
trust
and
the
art
of
friendly
adjustment
having
allowed
government
to
do
everything
for
us
we
have
gradually
become
incapable
of
doing
anything
for
ourselves
even
if
we
had
no
grievance
against
this
government
with
it
for
a
time
would
be
desirable
so
far
as
it
would
perforce
lead
us
to
trusting
and
working
with
one
another
and
thereby
strengthen
the
bonds
of
national
unity
the
most
tragic
consequence
of
dependence
on
the
complex
machinery
of
a
foreign
government
is
the
atrophy
of
the
communal
sense
the
direct
touch
with
administrative
cause
and
effect
is
lost
an
outside
protector
performs
all
the
necessary
functions
of
the
community
in
a
mysterious
manner
and
communal
duties
are
not
realised
by
the
people
the
one
reason
addressed
by
those
who
deny
to
us
the
capacity
for
is
the
insufficient
appreciation
by
the
people
of
communal
duties
and
discipline
it
is
only
by
actually
refraining
for
a
time
from
dependence
on
government
that
we
can
regain
learn
the
value
of
communal
duties
and
build
up
true
national
is
a
practical
and
positive
training
in
swadharma
and
swadharma
alone
can
lead
up
to
swaraj
the
negative
is
the
best
and
most
impressive
method
of
enforcing
the
value
of
the
positive
few
outside
government
circles
realise
in
the
present
police
anything
but
tyranny
and
corruption
but
if
the
units
of
the
present
police
were
withdrawn
we
would
soon
perforce
set
about
organising
a
substitute
and
most
people
would
realise
the
true
social
value
of
a
police
force
few
realise
in
the
present
taxes
anything
but
coercion
and
waste
but
most
people
would
soon
see
that
a
share
of
every
man
income
is
due
for
common
purposes
and
that
there
are
many
limitations
to
the
economical
management
of
public
institutions
we
would
begin
once
again
to
contribute
directly
build
up
and
maintain
national
institutions
in
the
place
of
those
that
now
mysteriously
spring
up
and
live
under
government
orders
emancipation
freedom
is
a
priceless
thing
but
it
is
a
stable
possession
only
when
it
is
acquired
by
a
nation
strenuous
effort
what
is
not
by
chance
or
outward
circumstance
or
given
by
the
generous
impulse
of
a
tyrant
prince
or
people
is
not
a
reality
a
nation
will
truly
enjoy
freedom
only
when
in
the
process
of
winning
or
defending
its
freedom
it
has
been
purified
and
consolidated
through
and
through
until
liberty
has
become
a
part
of
its
very
soul
otherwise
it
would
be
but
a
change
of
the
form
of
government
which
might
please
the
fancy
of
politicians
or
satisfy
the
classes
in
power
but
could
never
emancipate
a
people
an
act
of
parliament
can
never
create
citizens
in
hindustan
the
strength
spirit
and
happiness
of
a
people
who
have
fought
and
won
their
liberty
can
not
be
got
by
reform
acts
effort
and
sacrifice
are
the
necessary
conditions
of
real
stable
emancipation
liberty
unacquired
merely
found
will
on
the
test
fail
like
the
or
the
magician
plenty
the
war
that
the
people
of
india
have
declared
and
which
will
purify
and
consolidate
india
and
forge
for
her
a
true
and
stable
liberty
is
a
war
with
the
latest
and
most
effective
weapon
in
this
war
what
has
hitherto
been
in
the
world
an
undesirable
but
necessary
incident
in
freedom
battles
the
killing
of
innocent
men
has
been
eliminated
and
that
which
is
the
true
essential
for
forging
liberty
the
and
of
men
and
women
has
been
kept
pure
and
unalloyed
it
is
for
men
women
and
youth
every
one
of
them
that
lives
in
and
loves
india
to
do
his
bit
in
this
battle
not
waiting
for
others
not
calculating
the
chances
of
his
surviving
the
battle
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
his
sacrifice
soldiers
in
the
wars
did
not
insure
their
lives
before
going
to
the
front
the
privilege
of
youth
in
special
is
for
country
sake
to
exercise
their
comparative
freedom
and
give
up
the
yearning
for
lives
and
careers
built
on
the
slavery
of
the
people
that
on
which
a
foreign
government
truly
rests
whatever
may
be
the
illusions
on
their
or
our
part
is
not
the
strength
of
its
armed
forces
but
our
own
actual
service
on
the
part
of
one
generation
and
educational
preparation
for
future
service
on
the
part
of
the
next
generation
are
the
two
main
branches
of
this
of
slaves
in
the
perpetuation
of
slavery
the
boycott
of
government
service
and
the
is
aimed
at
the
first
the
boycott
of
government
controlled
schools
is
to
stop
the
second
if
either
the
one
or
the
other
of
these
two
branches
of
is
withdrawn
in
sufficient
measure
there
will
be
an
automatic
and
perfectly
peaceful
change
from
slavery
to
liberty
the
beat
preparation
for
any
one
who
desires
to
take
part
in
the
great
battle
now
going
on
is
a
silent

the
khilafat
why
i
have
joined
the
khilafat
movement
an
esteemed
south
african
friend
who
is
at
present
living
in
england
has
written
to
me
a
letter
from
which
i
make
the
following
excerpts
you
will
doubtless
remember
having
met
me
in
south
africa
at
the
time
when
the
rev
doke
was
assisting
you
in
your
campaign
there
and
i
subsequently
returned
to
england
deeply
impressed
with
the
rightness
of
your
attitude
in
that
country
during
the
months
before
war
i
wrote
and
lectured
and
spoke
on
your
behalf
in
several
places
which
i
do
not
regret
since
returning
from
military
service
however
i
have
noticed
from
the
papers
that
you
appear
to
be
adopting
a
more
militant
attitude
i
notice
a
report
in
the
times
that
you
are
assisting
and
countenancing
a
union
between
the
hindus
and
moslems
with
a
view
of
embarrassing
england
and
the
allied
powers
in
the
matter
of
the
dismemberment
of
the
ottoman
empire
or
the
ejection
of
the
turkish
government
from
constantinople
knowing
as
i
do
your
sense
of
justice
and
your
humane
instincts
i
feel
that
i
am
entitled
in
view
of
the
humble
part
that
i
have
taken
to
promote
your
interests
on
this
side
to
ask
you
whether
this
latter
report
is
correct
i
can
not
believe
that
you
have
wrongly
countenanced
a
movement
to
place
the
cruel
and
unjust
despotism
of
the
stamboul
government
above
the
interests
of
humanity
for
if
any
country
has
crippled
these
interests
in
the
east
it
has
surely
been
turkey
i
am
personally
familiar
with
the
conditions
in
syria
and
armenia
and
i
can
only
suppose
that
if
the
report
which
the
times
has
published
is
correct
you
have
thrown
to
one
side
your
moral
responsibilities
and
allied
yourself
with
one
of
the
prevailing
anarchies
however
until
i
hear
that
this
is
not
your
attitude
i
can
not
prejudice
my
mind
perhaps
you
will
do
me
the
favour
of
sending
me
a
reply
i
have
sent
a
reply
to
the
writer
but
as
the
views
expressed
in
the
quotation
are
likely
to
be
shared
by
many
of
my
english
friends
and
as
i
do
not
wish
if
i
can
possibly
help
it
to
forfeit
their
friendship
or
their
esteem
i
shall
endeavour
to
state
my
position
as
clearly
as
i
can
on
the
khilafat
question
the
letter
shows
what
risk
public
men
run
through
irresponsible
journalism
i
have
not
seen
report
referred
to
by
my
friend
but
it
is
evident
that
the
report
has
made
the
writer
to
suspect
my
alliance
with
the
prevailing
anarchies
and
to
think
that
i
have
thrown
to
one
side
my
moral
responsibilities
it
is
just
my
sense
of
moral
responsibilities
which
has
made
me
take
up
the
khilafat
question
and
to
identify
myself
entirely
with
the
mahomedans
it
is
perfectly
true
that
i
am
assisting
and
countenancing
the
union
between
hindus
and
muslims
but
certainly
not
with
a
view
of
embarrassing
england
and
the
allied
powers
in
the
matter
of
the
dismemberment
of
the
ottoman
empire
it
is
contrary
to
my
creed
to
embarrass
governments
or
anybody
else
this
does
not
how
ever
mean
that
certain
acts
of
mine
may
not
result
in
embarrassment
but
i
should
not
hold
myself
responsible
for
having
caused
embarrassment
when
i
resist
the
wrong
of
a
by
refusing
assistance
in
his
on
the
khilafat
question
i
refuse
to
be
party
to
a
broken
pledge
lloyd
george
solemn
declaration
is
practically
the
whole
of
the
case
for
indian
mahomedans
and
when
that
case
is
fortified
by
scriptural
authority
it
becomes
unanswerable
moreover
it
is
incorrect
to
say
that
i
have
allied
myself
to
one
of
the
prevailing
anarchies
or
that
i
have
wrongly
countenanced
the
movement
to
place
the
cruel
and
unjust
despotism
of
the
stamboul
government
above
the
interests
of
humanity
in
the
whole
of
the
mahomedan
demand
there
is
no
insistance
on
the
retention
of
the
unjust
despotism
of
the
stamboul
government
on
the
contrary
the
mahomedans
have
accepted
the
principle
of
taking
full
guarantees
from
that
government
for
the
protection
of
minorities
i
do
not
know
how
far
the
condition
of
armenia
and
syria
may
be
considered
an
and
how
far
the
turkish
government
may
be
held
responsible
for
it
i
much
suspect
that
the
reports
from
these
quarters
are
much
exaggerated
and
that
the
european
powers
are
themselves
in
a
measure
responsible
for
what
misrule
there
may
be
in
armenia
and
syria
but
i
am
in
no
way
interested
in
supporting
turkish
or
any
other
anarchy
the
allied
powers
can
easily
prevent
it
by
means
other
than
that
of
ending
turkish
rule
or
dismembering
and
weakening
the
ottoman
empire
the
allied
powers
are
not
dealing
with
a
new
situation
if
turkey
was
to
be
partitioned
the
position
should
have
been
made
clear
at
the
commencement
of
the
war
there
would
then
have
been
no
question
of
a
broken
pledge
as
it
is
no
indian
mahomedan
has
any
regard
for
the
promises
of
british
ministers
in
his
opinion
the
cry
against
turkey
is
that
of
christianity
islam
with
england
as
the
louder
in
the
cry
the
latest
cablegram
from
mahomed
ali
strengthens
the
impression
for
he
says
that
unlike
as
in
england
his
deputation
is
receiving
much
support
from
the
french
government
and
the
people
thus
if
it
is
true
as
i
hold
it
is
true
that
the
indian
mussalmans
have
a
cause
that
is
just
and
is
supported
by
scriptural
authority
then
for
the
hindus
not
to
support
them
to
the
utmost
would
be
a
cowardly
breach
of
brotherhood
and
they
would
forfeit
all
claim
to
consideration
from
their
mahomedan
countrymen
as
a
therefore
i
would
be
unworthy
of
the
position
i
claim
if
i
did
not
support
indian
mussalmans
in
their
struggle
to
maintain
the
khilafat
in
accordance
with
their
religious
belief
i
believe
that
in
supporting
them
i
am
rendering
a
service
to
the
empire
because
by
assisting
my
mahomedan
countrymen
to
give
a
disciplined
expression
to
their
sentiment
it
becomes
possible
to
make
the
agitation
thoroughly
orderly
and
even
successful
the
turkish
treaty
the
turkish
treaty
will
be
out
on
the
of
may
it
is
stated
to
provide
for
the
internationalisation
of
the
straits
the
occupation
of
gallipoli
by
the
allies
the
maintenance
of
allied
contingents
in
constantinople
and
the
appointment
of
a
commission
of
control
over
turkish
finances
the
san
remo
conference
has
entrusted
britain
with
mandates
for
mesopotamia
and
palestine
and
france
with
the
mandate
for
syria
as
regards
smyrna
the
accounts
so
far
received
inform
that
turkish
suzerainty
over
smyrna
will
be
indicated
by
the
fact
that
the
population
will
not
be
entitled
to
send
delegates
to
the
greek
parliament
but
at
the
end
of
five
years
local
smyrna
parliament
will
have
the
right
of
voting
in
favour
of
union
with
greece
and
in
such
an
event
turkish
suzerainty
will
cease
turkish
suzerainty
will
be
confined
to
the
area
within
the
chatalja
lines
with
regard
to
emir
position
there
is
no
news
except
that
the
mandates
of
britain
and
france
transform
his
military
title
into
a
civil
title
we
have
given
above
the
terms
of
the
turkish
treaty
as
indicated
in
router
messages
these
reports
are
incomplete
and
all
of
them
are
not
equally
authenticated
but
if
these
terms
are
true
they
are
a
challenge
to
the
muslim
demands
turkish
sovereignty
is
confined
to
the
chatalja
lines
this
means
that
the
big
three
of
the
supreme
council
have
cut
off
thrace
from
turkish
dominions
this
is
a
distinct
breach
of
the
pledge
given
by
one
of
these
three
the
premier
of
the
british
empire
to
remain
within
the
chatalja
lines
and
we
are
afraid
as
a
dependent
of
the
allies
is
for
the
sultan
a
humiliating
position
inconsistent
with
the
koranic
injunctions
such
a
restricted
position
of
the
turks
is
virtually
a
success
of
the
bag
and
baggage
school
it
is
not
yet
known
how
the
supreme
council
disposed
of
the
rich
and
renowned
lands
of
asia
minor
if
lloyd
george
views
recently
expressed
in
this
respect
have
received
the
allies
sanction
it
is
probable
nothing
less
than
a
common
control
is
expected
the
decision
in
the
case
of
smyrna
will
be
satisfying
to
none
though
the
allies
seem
to
have
made
by
their
arrangement
a
skillful
attempt
to
please
all
the
parties
concerned
lloyd
george
in
his
reply
to
the
khilafat
deputation
had
talked
about
the
careful
investigations
by
an
impartial
committee
and
had
added
the
great
majority
of
the
population
undoubtedly
prefer
greek
rule
to
turkish
rule
so
i
understand
but
the
decision
postpones
to
carry
out
his
understanding
till
a
period
of
five
years
when
we
come
to
the
question
of
mandates
the
allied
powers
motives
come
out
more
distinctly
the
arabs
claim
of
independence
was
used
as
a
difficulty
against
keeping
turkish
sovereignty
this
was
defended
in
the
of
and
by
pointing
out
parallels
of
transylvania
and
other
provinces
when
the
final
moment
came
the
allies
have
ventured
to
divide
the
spoils
amongst
themselves
britain
is
given
the
mandate
over
mesopotamia
and
palestine
and
france
has
the
mandate
over
syria
the
arab
delegation
complains
in
their
note
lately
issued
expressing
their
disappointment
at
the
supreme
council
decision
with
regard
to
the
arab
liberated
countries
which
it
declares
is
contrary
to
the
principle
of
so
what
little
news
has
arrived
about
the
turkish
treaty
is
uniformly
disquieting
the
moslems
have
found
sufficient
ground
to
honour
russia
more
than
the
allies
russia
has
recognised
the
freedom
of
khiva
and
bokhara
the
moslem
world
as
the
amir
of
afghanistan
said
in
his
speech
will
feel
grateful
towards
russia
in
spite
of
all
the
rumours
abroad
about
its
anarchy
and
disorder
whereas
the
whole
moslem
world
will
resent
the
action
of
the
other
european
nations
who
have
allied
with
each
other
to
carry
out
a
joint
coercion
and
extinction
of
turkey
in
the
name
of
and
partly
in
the
guise
of
the
interest
of
civilization
the
terms
of
the
turkish
treaty
are
not
only
a
breach
of
the
pledge
not
only
a
sin
against
the
principle
of
but
they
also
show
a
reckless
indifference
of
the
allied
powers
towards
the
koranic
injunctions
the
terms
point
out
that
lloyd
misinformed
ideas
of
khilafat
have
prevailed
in
the
council
like
lloyd
george
other
statesmen
also
at
san
remo
have
compared
caliphate
with
popedom
and
ignored
the
koronic
idea
of
associating
spiritual
power
with
temporal
power
these
misguided
statesmen
were
too
much
possessed
by
haughtiness
and
so
they
refused
to
receive
any
enlightenment
on
the
question
of
khilafat
from
the
deputation
they
could
have
corrected
themselves
had
they
heard
mahomed
ali
on
this
point
speaking
at
the
essex
hall
meeting
mahomed
ali
distinguished
between
popedom
and
caliphate
and
clearly
explained
what
caliphate
means
he
said
islam
is
supernational
and
not
national
the
basis
of
islamic
sympathy
is
a
common
outlook
on
life
and
common
culture
and
it
has
two
centres
the
personal
centre
is
the
island
of
arabia
the
khalifa
is
the
commander
of
the
faithful
and
his
orders
must
be
obeyed
by
all
muslims
so
long
and
so
long
only
as
they
are
not
at
variance
with
the
commandments
of
god
and
the
traditions
of
the
prophet
but
since
there
is
no
lacerating
distinction
between
things
temporal
and
things
spiritual
the
khalifa
is
something
more
than
a
pope
and
can
not
be
vaticanised
but
he
is
also
less
than
a
pope
for
he
is
not
infallible
if
he
persists
in
conduct
we
can
depose
him
and
we
have
deposed
him
more
than
once
but
so
long
as
he
orders
only
that
which
islam
demands
we
must
support
him
he
and
no
other
ruler
is
the
defender
of
faith
these
few
words
could
have
removed
the
rooted
in
the
minds
of
those
that
at
san
remo
if
they
were
in
earnest
for
a
just
solution
but
mahomed
ali
deputation
was
not
given
any
hearing
by
the
peace
conference
they
were
told
that
the
peace
conference
had
already
heard
the
official
delegation
of
india
on
this
question
but
the
wrong
notions
the
allies
still
entertain
about
caliphate
are
a
sufficient
indication
of
the
effects
of
the
work
of
this
official
delegation
the
result
of
these
wrong
notions
is
the
present
settlement
and
this
unjust
settlement
will
unsettle
the
world
they
know
not
what
they
do
turkish
peace
terms
the
question
of
question
is
the
khilafat
question
otherwise
known
as
that
of
the
turkish
peace
terms
his
excellency
the
viceroy
deserves
our
thanks
for
receiving
the
joint
deputation
even
at
this
late
hour
especially
when
he
was
busy
preparing
to
receive
the
head
of
the
different
provinces
his
excellency
must
be
thanked
for
the
unfailing
courtesy
with
which
he
received
the
deputation
and
the
courteous
language
in
which
his
reply
was
couched
but
mere
courtesy
valuable
as
it
is
at
all
times
never
so
valuable
as
at
this
is
not
enough
at
this
critical
moment
words
butter
no
parsnips
is
a
proverb
more
applicable
than
ever
before
behind
the
courtesy
there
was
the
determination
to
punish
turkey
punishment
of
turkey
is
a
thing
which
muslim
sentiment
can
not
tolerate
for
a
moment
muslim
soldiers
are
as
responsible
for
the
result
of
the
war
as
any
others
it
was
to
appease
them
that
asquith
said
when
turkey
decided
to
join
the
central
powers
that
the
british
government
had
no
designs
on
turkey
and
that
his
majesty
government
would
never
think
of
punishing
the
sultan
for
the
misdeeds
of
the
turkish
committee
examined
by
that
standard
the
viceregal
reply
is
not
only
disappointing
but
it
is
a
fall
from
truth
and
justice
what
is
this
british
empire
it
is
as
much
mahomedan
and
hindu
as
it
is
christian
its
religious
neutrality
is
not
a
virtue
or
if
it
is
it
is
a
virtue
of
necessity
such
a
mighty
empire
could
not
be
held
together
on
any
other
terms
british
ministers
are
therefore
bound
to
protect
mahomedan
interests
as
any
other
indeed
as
the
muslim
rejoinder
says
they
are
bound
to
make
the
cause
their
own
what
is
the
use
of
his
excellency
having
presented
the
muslim
claim
before
the
conference
if
the
cause
is
lost
the
mahomedans
will
be
entitled
to
think
that
britain
did
not
do
her
duty
by
them
and
the
viceregal
reply
confirms
the
view
when
his
excellency
says
that
turkey
must
suffer
for
her
having
joined
the
central
powers
he
but
expresses
the
opinion
of
british
ministers
we
hope
therefore
with
the
framers
of
the
muslim
rejoinder
that
his
majesty
ministers
will
mend
the
mistakes
if
any
have
been
committed
and
secure
a
settlement
that
would
satisfy
mahomedan
sentiment
what
does
the
sentiment
demand
the
preservation
of
the
khilafat
with
such
guarantee
as
may
be
necessary
for
the
protection
of
the
interests
of
the
races
living
under
turkish
rule
and
the
control
over
arabia
and
the
holy
places
with
such
arrangement
as
may
be
required
for
guaranteeing
arab
should
the
arabs
desire
it
it
is
hardly
possible
to
state
the
claim
more
fairly
than
has
been
done
it
is
a
claim
backed
by
justice
by
the
declarations
of
british
ministers
and
by
the
unanimous
hindu
and
muslim
opinion
it
would
be
midsummer
madness
to
reject
or
whittle
down
a
claim
so
backed
the
suzerainty
over
arabia
as
i
told
you
in
my
last
letter
i
think
gandhi
has
made
a
serious
mistake
in
the
kailafat
business
the
indian
mahomedans
base
their
demand
on
the
assertion
that
their
religion
requires
the
turkish
rule
over
arabia
but
when
they
have
against
them
in
this
matter
the
arabs
themselves
it
is
impossible
to
regard
the
theory
of
the
indian
mahomedans
as
essential
to
islam
after
all
if
the
arabs
do
not
represent
islam
who
does
it
is
as
if
the
german
roman
catholics
made
a
demand
in
the
name
of
roman
catholicism
with
rome
and
the
italians
making
a
contrary
demand
but
even
if
the
religion
of
the
indian
mahomedans
did
require
that
turkish
rule
should
be
imposed
upon
the
arabs
against
their
will
one
could
not
recognise
as
a
really
religious
demand
one
which
required
the
continued
oppression
of
one
people
by
another
when
an
assurance
was
given
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
to
the
indian
mahomedans
that
the
mahomedan
religion
would
be
respected
that
could
never
have
meant
that
a
temporal
sovereignty
which
violated
the
principles
of
would
be
upheld
we
could
not
now
stand
by
and
see
the
turks
the
arabs
for
the
arabs
would
certainly
fight
against
them
without
grossly
betraying
the
arabs
to
whom
we
have
given
pledges
it
is
not
true
that
the
arab
hostility
to
the
turks
was
due
simply
to
european
suggestion
no
doubt
during
the
war
we
availed
ourselves
of
the
arab
hostility
to
the
turks
to
get
another
ally
but
the
hostility
had
existed
long
before
the
war
the
mahomedan
subjects
of
the
sultan
in
general
wanted
to
get
rid
of
his
rule
it
is
the
indian
mahomedans
who
have
no
experience
of
that
rule
who
want
to
impose
it
on
others
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
idea
of
any
restoration
of
turkish
rule
in
syria
or
arabia
seems
so
remote
from
all
possibilities
that
to
discuss
it
seems
like
discussing
a
restoration
of
the
holy
roman
empire
i
can
not
conceive
what
series
of
events
could
bring
it
about
the
indian
mahomedans
certainly
could
not
march
into
arabia
themselves
and
conquer
the
arabs
for
the
sultan
and
no
amount
of
agitation
and
trouble
in
india
would
ever
induce
england
to
put
back
turkish
rule
in
arabia
in
this
matter
it
is
not
english
imperialism
which
the
indian
mahomedans
are
up
against
but
the
mass
of
english
liberal
and
humanitarian
opinion
the
mass
of
the
better
opinion
of
england
which
wants
to
go
forward
in
india
supposing
the
indian
mahomedans
could
stir
up
an
agitation
so
violent
in
india
as
to
sever
the
connection
between
india
and
the
british
crown
still
they
would
not
be
any
nearer
to
their
purpose
for
they
do
have
considerable
influence
on
british
even
if
in
this
matter
of
the
turkish
question
their
influence
has
not
been
sufficient
to
turn
the
scale
against
the
very
heavy
weights
on
the
other
side
it
has
weighed
in
the
scale
but
apart
from
the
british
connection
indian
mahomedans
would
have
no
influence
at
all
outside
india
they
would
not
count
for
more
in
world
politics
than
the
mahomedans
of
china
i
think
it
is
likely
apart
from
the
pressure
of
america
on
the
other
side
i
should
say
certain
that
the
influence
of
the
indian
mahomedans
may
at
any
rate
avail
to
keep
the
sultan
in
constantinople
but
i
doubt
whether
they
will
gain
any
advantage
by
doing
so
for
a
turkey
cut
down
to
the
turkish
parts
of
constantinople
would
be
a
very
inconvenient
capital
i
think
its
inconvenience
would
more
than
outweigh
the
sentimental
gratification
of
keeping
up
a
phantom
of
the
old
ottoman
empire
but
if
the
indian
mahomedans
want
the
sultan
to
retain
his
place
in
constantinople
i
think
the
assurances
given
officially
by
the
viceroy
in
india
now
binds
us
to
insist
on
his
remaining
there
and
i
think
he
will
remain
there
in
spite
of
america
this
is
an
extract
from
the
letter
of
an
englishman
enjoying
a
position
in
great
britain
to
a
friend
in
india
it
is
a
typical
letter
sober
honest
to
the
point
and
put
in
such
graceful
language
that
whilst
it
challenges
you
it
commands
your
respect
by
its
very
gracefulness
but
it
is
just
this
attitude
based
upon
insufficient
or
false
information
which
has
ruined
many
a
cause
in
the
british
isles
the
superficiality
the
the
inaccuracy
and
often
even
dishonesty
that
have
crept
into
modern
journalism
continuously
mislead
honest
men
who
want
to
see
nothing
but
justice
done
then
there
are
always
interested
groups
whose
business
it
is
to
serve
their
ends
by
means
of
faul
or
food
and
the
honest
englishman
wishing
to
vote
for
justice
but
swayed
by
conflicting
opinions
and
dominated
by
distorted
versions
often
ends
by
becoming
an
instrument
of
injustice
the
writer
of
the
letter
quoted
above
has
built
up
convincing
argument
on
imaginary
data
he
has
successfully
shown
that
the
mahomedan
case
as
it
has
been
presented
to
him
is
a
rotten
case
in
india
where
it
is
not
quite
easy
to
distort
facts
about
the
khilafat
english
friends
admit
the
utter
justice
of
the
claim
but
they
plead
helplessness
and
tell
us
that
the
government
of
india
and
montagu
have
done
all
it
was
humanly
possible
for
them
to
do
and
if
now
the
judgment
goes
against
islam
indian
mahomedans
should
resign
themselves
to
it
this
extraordinary
state
of
things
would
not
be
possible
except
under
this
modern
rush
and
preoccupations
of
all
responsible
people
let
us
for
a
moment
examine
the
case
as
it
has
been
imagined
by
the
writer
he
suggests
that
indian
mahomedans
want
turkish
rule
in
arabia
in
spite
of
the
opposition
of
the
arabs
themselves
and
that
if
the
arabs
do
not
want
turkish
rule
the
writer
argues
no
false
religions
sentiment
can
be
permitted
to
interfere
with
of
the
arabs
when
india
herself
has
been
pleading
for
that
very
status
now
the
fact
is
that
the
mahomedans
as
is
known
to
everybody
who
has
at
all
studied
the
case
have
never
asked
for
turkish
rule
in
arabia
in
opposition
to
the
arabs
on
the
contrary
they
have
said
that
they
have
no
intention
of
resisting
arabian
all
they
ask
for
is
turkish
suzerainty
over
arabia
which
would
guarantee
complete
for
the
arabs
they
want
khalif
control
of
the
holy
places
of
islam
in
other
words
they
ask
for
nothing
more
than
what
was
guaranteed
by
lloyd
george
and
on
the
strength
of
which
guarantee
mahomedan
soldiers
split
their
blood
on
behalf
of
the
allied
powers
all
the
elaborate
argument
therefore
and
the
cogent
reasoning
of
the
above
extract
fall
to
pieces
based
as
they
are
upon
a
case
that
has
never
existed
i
have
thrown
myself
heart
and
soul
into
this
question
because
british
pledges
abstract
justice
and
religious
sentiment
coincide
i
can
conceive
the
possibility
of
a
blind
and
fanatical
religious
sentiment
existing
in
opposition
to
pure
justice
i
should
then
resist
the
former
and
fight
for
the
latter
nor
would
i
insist
upon
pledges
given
dishonestly
to
support
an
unjust
cause
as
has
happened
with
england
in
the
case
of
the
secret
treaties
resistance
there
becomes
not
only
lawful
but
obligatory
on
the
part
of
a
nation
that
prides
itself
on
its
righteousness
it
is
unnecessary
for
me
to
examine
the
position
imagined
by
the
english
friend
how
india
would
have
fared
had
she
been
an
independent
power
it
is
unnecessary
because
indian
mahomedans
and
for
that
matter
india
are
fighting
for
a
cause
that
is
admittedly
just
a
cause
in
aid
of
which
they
are
invoking
the
support
of
the
british
people
i
would
however
venture
to
suggest
that
this
is
a
cause
in
which
mere
sympathy
will
not
suffice
it
is
a
cause
which
demands
support
that
is
strong
enough
to
bring
about
substantial
justice
further
questions
answered
i
have
been
overwhelmed
with
public
criticism
and
private
advice
and
even
anonymous
letters
telling
me
exactly
what
i
should
do
some
are
impatient
that
i
do
not
advise
immediate
and
extensive
others
tell
me
what
harm
i
am
doing
the
country
by
throwing
it
knowingly
in
a
tempest
of
violence
on
either
side
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
deal
with
the
whole
of
the
criticism
but
i
would
summarize
some
of
the
objections
and
endeavour
to
answer
them
to
the
best
of
my
ability
these
are
in
addition
to
those
i
have
already
answered
turkish
claim
is
immoral
or
unjust
and
how
can
i
a
lover
of
truth
and
justice
support
it
even
if
the
claim
be
just
in
theory
the
turk
is
hopelessly
incapable
weak
and
cruel
he
does
not
deserve
any
assistance
even
if
turkey
deserves
all
that
is
claimed
for
her
why
should
i
land
india
in
an
international
struggle
it
is
no
part
of
the
indian
mahomedans
business
to
meddle
in
this
affair
if
they
cherish
any
political
ambition
they
have
tried
they
have
failed
and
they
should
now
sit
still
if
it
is
a
religious
matter
with
them
it
can
not
appeal
to
the
hindu
reason
in
the
manner
it
is
put
and
in
any
case
hindus
ought
not
to
identify
themselves
with
mahomedans
in
their
religious
quarrel
with
christendom
in
no
case
should
i
advocate
which
in
its
extreme
sense
is
nothing
but
a
rebellion
no
matter
how
peaceful
it
may
be
moreover
my
experience
of
last
year
must
show
me
that
it
is
beyond
the
capacity
of
any
single
human
being
to
control
the
forces
of
violence
that
are
lying
dormant
in
the
land
is
futile
because
people
will
never
respond
in
right
earnest
and
reaction
that
might
afterwards
set
in
will
be
worse
than
the
state
of
hopefulness
we
are
now
in
will
bring
about
cessation
of
all
other
activities
even
working
of
the
reforms
thus
set
back
the
clock
of
progress
however
pure
my
motives
may
be
those
of
the
mussalmans
are
obviously
revengeful
i
shall
now
answer
the
objections
in
the
order
in
which
they
are
stated
in
my
opinion
the
turkish
claim
is
not
only
not
immoral
and
unjust
but
it
is
highly
equitable
if
only
because
turkey
wants
to
retain
what
is
her
own
and
the
mahomedan
manifesto
has
definitely
declared
that
whatever
guarantees
may
be
necessary
to
be
taken
for
the
protection
of
and
races
should
be
taken
so
as
to
give
the
christians
theirs
and
the
arabs
their
under
the
turkish
suzerainty
i
do
not
believe
the
turk
to
be
weak
incapable
or
cruel
he
is
certainly
disorganised
and
probably
without
good
generalship
he
has
been
obliged
to
fight
against
heavy
odds
the
argument
of
weakness
incapacity
and
cruelty
one
often
hears
quoted
in
connection
with
those
from
whom
power
is
sought
to
be
taken
away
about
the
alleged
massacres
a
proper
commission
has
been
asked
for
but
never
granted
and
in
any
case
security
can
be
taken
against
oppression
i
have
already
stated
that
if
i
were
not
interested
in
the
indian
mahomedans
i
would
not
interest
myself
in
the
welfare
of
the
turks
any
more
than
i
am
in
that
of
the
austrians
or
the
poles
but
i
am
bound
as
an
indian
to
share
the
sufferings
and
trial
of
if
i
deem
the
mahomedan
to
be
my
brother
it
is
my
duty
to
help
him
in
his
hour
of
peril
to
the
best
of
my
ability
if
his
cause
commends
itself
to
me
as
just
the
fourth
refers
to
the
extent
hindus
should
join
hands
with
the
mahomedans
it
is
therefore
a
matter
of
feeling
and
opinion
it
is
expedient
to
suffer
for
my
mahomedan
brother
to
the
utmost
in
a
just
cause
and
i
should
therefore
travel
with
him
along
the
whole
road
so
long
as
the
means
employed
by
him
are
as
honourable
as
his
end
i
can
not
regulate
the
mahomedan
feeling
i
must
accept
his
statement
that
the
khilafat
is
with
him
a
religious
question
in
the
sense
that
it
binds
him
to
reach
the
goal
even
at
the
cost
of
his
own
life
i
do
not
consider
to
be
a
rebellion
because
it
is
free
from
violence
in
a
larger
sense
all
opposition
to
a
government
measure
is
a
rebellion
in
that
sense
rebellion
in
a
just
cause
is
a
duty
the
extent
of
opposition
being
determined
by
the
measure
of
the
injustice
done
and
felt
my
experience
of
last
year
shows
me
that
in
spite
of
aberrations
in
some
parts
of
india
the
country
was
entirely
under
control
that
the
influence
of
satyagraha
was
profoundly
for
its
good
and
that
where
violence
did
break
out
there
were
local
causes
that
directly
contributed
to
it
at
the
same
time
i
admit
that
even
the
violence
that
did
take
place
on
the
part
of
the
people
and
the
spirit
of
lawlessness
that
was
undoubtedly
shown
in
some
parts
should
have
remained
under
check
i
have
made
ample
acknowledgment
of
the
miscalculation
i
then
made
but
all
the
painful
experience
that
i
then
gained
did
not
any
way
shake
my
belief
in
satyagraha
or
in
the
possibility
of
that
matchless
force
being
utilised
in
india
ample
provision
is
being
made
this
time
to
avoid
the
mistakes
of
the
past
but
i
must
refuse
to
be
deterred
from
a
clear
course
because
it
may
be
attended
by
violence
totally
unintended
and
in
spite
of
extraordinary
efforts
that
are
being
made
to
prevent
it
at
the
same
time
i
must
make
my
position
clear
nothing
can
possibly
prevent
a
satyagrahi
from
doing
his
duty
because
of
the
frown
of
the
authorities
i
would
risk
if
necessary
a
million
lives
so
long
as
they
are
voluntary
sufferers
and
are
innocent
spotless
victims
it
is
the
mistakes
of
the
people
that
matter
in
a
satyagraha
campaign
mistakes
even
insanity
must
be
expected
from
the
strong
and
the
powerful
and
the
moment
of
victory
has
come
when
there
is
no
retort
to
the
mad
fury
of
the
powerful
but
a
voluntary
dignified
and
quiet
submission
but
not
submission
to
the
will
of
the
authority
that
has
put
itself
in
the
wrong
the
secret
of
success
lies
therefore
in
holding
every
english
life
and
the
life
of
every
officer
serving
the
government
as
sacred
as
those
of
our
own
dear
ones
all
the
wonderful
experience
i
have
gained
now
during
nearly
years
of
conscious
existence
has
convinced
me
that
there
is
no
gift
so
precious
as
that
of
life
i
make
bold
to
say
that
the
moment
the
englishmen
feel
that
although
they
are
in
india
in
a
hopeless
minority
their
lives
are
protected
against
harm
not
because
of
the
matchless
weapons
of
destruction
which
are
at
their
disposal
but
because
indians
refuse
to
take
the
lives
even
of
those
whom
they
may
consider
to
be
utterly
in
the
wrong
that
moment
will
see
a
transformation
in
the
english
nature
in
its
relation
to
india
and
that
moment
will
also
be
the
moment
when
all
the
destructive
cutlery
that
is
to
be
had
in
india
will
begin
to
rust
i
know
that
this
is
a
vision
that
can
not
matter
to
me
it
is
enough
for
me
to
see
the
light
and
to
act
up
to
it
and
it
is
more
than
enough
when
i
gain
companions
in
the
onward
march
i
have
claimed
in
private
conversations
with
english
friends
that
it
is
because
of
my
incessant
preaching
of
the
gospel
of
and
my
having
successfully
demonstrated
its
practical
utility
that
so
far
the
forces
of
violence
which
are
undoubtedly
in
existence
in
connection
with
the
khilafat
movement
have
remained
under
complete
control
from
a
religious
standpoint
the
seventh
objection
is
hardly
worth
considering
if
people
do
not
respond
to
the
movement
of
it
would
be
a
pity
but
that
can
be
no
reason
for
a
reformer
not
to
try
it
would
be
to
me
a
demonstration
that
the
present
position
of
hopefulness
is
not
dependent
on
any
inward
strength
or
knowledge
but
it
is
hope
born
of
ignorance
and
superstition
if
is
taken
up
in
earnest
it
must
bring
about
a
cessation
of
all
other
activities
including
the
reforms
but
i
decline
to
draw
therefore
the
corollary
that
it
will
set
back
the
clock
of
progress
on
the
contrary
i
consider
to
be
such
a
powerful
and
pure
instrument
that
if
it
is
enforced
in
an
earnest
spirit
it
will
be
like
seeking
first
the
kingdom
of
god
and
everything
else
following
as
a
matter
of
course
people
will
have
then
realised
their
true
power
they
would
have
learnt
the
value
of
discipline
joint
action
organisation
and
everything
else
that
goes
to
make
a
nation
great
and
good
and
not
merely
great
i
do
not
know
that
i
have
a
right
to
arrogate
greater
purity
for
myself
than
for
our
mussalman
brethren
but
i
do
admit
that
they
do
not
believe
in
my
doctrine
of
to
the
full
extent
for
them
it
is
a
weapon
of
the
weak
an
expedient
they
consider
without
violence
to
be
the
only
thing
open
to
them
in
the
war
of
direct
action
i
know
that
if
some
of
them
could
offer
successful
violence
they
would
do
but
they
are
convinced
that
humanly
speaking
it
is
an
impossibility
for
them
therefore
is
a
matter
not
merely
of
duty
but
also
of
revenge
whereas
i
take
up
against
the
government
as
i
have
actually
taken
it
up
in
practice
against
members
of
my
own
family
i
entertain
very
high
regard
for
the
british
constitution
i
have
not
only
no
enmity
against
englishmen
but
i
regard
much
in
english
character
as
worthy
of
my
emulation
i
count
many
as
my
friends
it
is
against
my
religion
to
regard
any
one
as
an
enemy
i
entertain
similar
sentiments
with
respect
to
mahomedans
i
find
their
cause
to
be
just
and
pure
although
therefore
their
viewpoint
is
different
from
mine
i
do
not
hesitate
to
associate
with
them
and
invite
them
to
give
my
method
a
trial
for
i
believe
that
the
use
of
a
pure
weapon
even
from
a
mistaken
motive
does
not
fail
to
produce
some
good
even
as
the
telling
of
truth
if
only
because
for
the
time
being
it
is
the
best
policy
is
at
least
so
much
to
the
good
candler
open
letter
candler
has
favoured
me
with
an
open
letter
on
this
question
of
questions
the
letter
has
already
appeared
in
the
press
i
can
appreciate
candler
position
as
i
would
like
him
and
other
englishmen
to
appreciate
mine
and
that
of
hundreds
of
hindus
who
feel
as
i
do
candler
letter
is
an
attempt
to
show
that
lloyd
pledge
is
not
in
any
way
broken
by
the
peace
terms
i
quite
agree
with
him
that
lloyd
george
words
ought
not
to
be
torn
from
their
context
to
support
the
mahomedan
claim
these
are
lloyd
words
as
quoted
in
the
recent
viceregal
message
nor
are
we
fighting
to
destroy
or
to
deprive
turkey
of
its
capital
or
of
the
rich
and
renowned
lands
of
asia
minor
and
thrace
which
are
predominantly
turkish
in
race
candler
seems
to
read
as
if
it
meant
they
whereas
i
give
the
pronoun
its
natural
meaning
namely
that
the
prime
minister
knew
in
that
the
lands
referred
to
by
him
were
predominantly
turkish
in
race
and
if
this
is
the
meaning
i
venture
to
suggest
that
the
pledge
has
been
broken
in
a
most
barefaced
manner
for
there
is
practically
nothing
left
to
the
turk
of
rich
and
renowned
lands
of
asia
minor
and
thrace
i
have
already
my
view
of
the
retention
of
the
sultan
in
constantinople
it
is
an
insult
to
the
intelligence
of
man
to
suggest
that
maintenance
of
the
turkish
empire
in
the
homeland
of
the
turkish
race
with
its
capital
at
constantinople
has
been
left
unimpaired
by
the
terms
of
peace
this
is
the
other
passage
from
the
speech
which
i
presume
candler
wants
me
to
read
together
with
the
one
already
quoted
while
we
do
not
challenge
the
maintenance
of
the
turkish
empire
in
the
of
the
turkish
race
with
its
capital
at
constantinople
the
passage
between
the
mediterranean
and
the
black
sea
being
armenia
mesopotamia
syria
and
palestine
are
in
our
judgment
entitled
to
a
recognition
of
their
separate
national
condition
did
that
mean
entire
removal
of
turkish
influence
extinction
of
turkish
suzerainty
and
the
introduction
of
influence
under
the
guise
of
mandates
have
the
moslems
of
arabia
armenia
mesopotamia
syria
and
palestine
been
committed
or
is
the
new
arrangement
being
superimposed
upon
them
by
powers
conscious
of
their
own
rather
than
of
justice
of
their
action
i
for
one
would
nurse
by
every
legitimate
means
the
spirit
of
independence
in
the
brave
arabs
but
i
shudder
to
think
what
will
happen
to
them
under
the
schemes
of
exploitation
of
their
country
by
the
greedy
capitalists
protected
as
they
will
be
by
the
mandatory
powers
if
the
pledge
is
to
be
fulfilled
let
these
places
have
full
with
suzerainty
to
be
retained
with
turkey
as
has
been
suggested
by
the
of
let
there
be
all
the
necessary
guarantees
taken
from
turkey
about
the
internal
independence
of
the
arabs
but
to
remove
that
suzerainty
to
deprive
the
khalif
of
the
wardenship
of
the
holy
places
is
to
render
khilafat
a
mockery
which
no
mahomedan
can
possibly
look
upon
with
equanimity
i
am
not
alone
in
my
interpretation
of
the
pledge
the
right
ameer
ali
calls
the
peace
terms
a
breach
of
faith
charles
roberts
reminds
the
british
public
that
the
indian
mussalman
sentiment
regarding
the
turkish
treaty
is
based
upon
the
prime
minister
pledge
regarding
thrace
constantinople
and
turkish
lands
in
asia
minor
repeated
on
february
last
with
deliberation
by
lloyd
george
roberts
holds
that
the
pledge
must
be
treated
as
a
whole
not
as
binding
only
regarding
constantinople
but
also
binding
as
regards
thrace
and
asia
minor
he
describes
the
pledge
as
binding
upon
the
nation
as
a
whole
and
its
breach
in
any
part
as
a
gross
breach
of
faith
on
the
part
of
the
british
empire
he
demands
that
if
there
is
an
unanswerable
reply
to
the
charge
of
breach
of
faith
it
ought
to
be
given
and
adds
the
prime
minister
may
regard
his
own
word
lightly
if
he
chooses
but
he
has
no
right
to
break
a
pledge
given
on
behalf
of
the
nation
he
concludes
that
it
is
incredible
that
such
pledge
should
not
have
been
kept
in
the
letter
and
in
the
spirit
he
adds
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
these
views
are
fully
shared
by
prominent
members
of
the
cabinet
i
wonder
if
candler
knows
what
is
going
on
in
england
pickthall
writing
in
says
no
impartial
international
enquiry
into
the
whole
question
of
the
armenian
massacres
has
been
instituted
in
the
ample
time
which
has
elapsed
since
the
conclusion
of
armistice
with
turkey
the
turkish
government
has
asked
for
such
enquiry
but
the
armenian
organisations
and
the
armenian
partisans
refuse
to
hear
of
such
a
thing
declaring
that
the
bryce
and
lepssens
reports
are
quite
sufficient
to
condemn
the
turks
in
other
words
the
judgment
should
be
given
on
the
case
for
prosecution
alone
the
commission
which
investigated
the
unfortunate
events
in
smyrna
last
year
made
a
report
unfavourable
to
greek
claims
therefore
that
report
has
not
been
published
here
in
england
though
in
other
countries
it
has
long
been
public
property
he
then
goes
on
to
show
how
money
is
being
scattered
by
armenian
and
greek
emissaries
in
order
to
popularise
their
cause
and
adds
this
conjunction
of
dense
ignorance
and
cunning
falsehood
is
fraught
with
instant
danger
to
the
british
realm
and
concludes
a
government
and
people
which
prefer
propaganda
to
fact
as
the
ground
of
policy
and
foreign
policy
at
that
is
i
have
reproduced
the
above
extract
in
order
to
show
that
the
present
british
policy
has
been
affected
by
propaganda
of
an
unscrupulous
nature
turkey
which
was
dominant
over
two
million
square
miles
of
asia
africa
and
europe
in
the
century
under
the
terms
of
the
treaty
says
the
has
dwindled
down
to
little
more
than
square
miles
it
says
all
european
turkey
could
now
be
accommodated
comfortably
between
the
landsend
and
the
tamar
cornawal
alone
exceeding
its
total
area
and
but
for
its
alliance
with
germany
turkey
could
have
been
assured
of
retaining
at
least
sixty
thousand
square
miles
of
the
eastern
balkans
i
do
not
know
whether
the
view
is
generally
shared
is
it
by
way
of
punishment
that
turkey
is
to
undergo
such
shrinkage
or
is
it
because
justice
demands
it
if
turkey
had
not
made
the
mistake
of
joining
germany
would
the
principle
of
nationality
have
been
still
applied
to
armenia
arabia
mesopotamia
and
palestine
let
me
now
remind
those
who
think
with
candler
that
the
promise
was
not
made
by
lloyd
george
to
the
people
of
india
in
anticipation
of
the
supply
of
recruits
continuing
in
defending
his
own
statement
lloyd
george
is
reported
to
have
said
the
effect
of
the
statement
in
india
was
that
recruiting
went
up
appreciably
from
that
very
moment
they
were
not
all
mahomedans
but
there
were
many
mahomedans
amongst
them
now
we
are
told
that
was
an
offer
to
turkey
but
they
rejected
it
and
therefore
we
were
absolutely
free
it
was
not
it
is
too
often
forgotten
that
we
are
the
greatest
mahomedan
power
in
the
world
and
of
the
population
of
the
british
empire
is
mahomedan
there
have
been
no
more
loyal
adherents
to
the
throne
and
no
more
effective
and
loyal
supporters
of
the
empire
in
its
hour
of
trial
gave
a
solemn
pledge
and
they
accepted
they
are
disturbed
by
the
prospect
of
our
not
abiding
by
it
who
shall
interpret
that
pledge
and
how
how
did
the
government
of
india
itself
interpret
it
did
it
or
did
it
not
energetically
support
the
claim
for
the
control
of
the
holy
places
of
islam
vesting
in
the
khalif
did
the
government
of
india
suggest
that
the
whole
of
could
be
taken
away
consistently
with
that
pledge
from
the
sphere
of
influence
of
the
khalif
and
given
over
to
the
allies
as
mandatory
powers
why
does
the
government
of
india
sympathise
with
the
indian
mussalmans
if
the
terms
are
all
they
should
be
so
much
for
the
pledge
i
would
like
to
guard
myself
against
being
understood
that
i
stand
or
fall
absolutely
by
lloyd
george
declaration
i
have
advisedly
used
the
adverb
in
connection
with
it
it
is
an
important
qualification
candler
seems
to
suggest
that
my
goal
is
something
more
than
merely
attaining
justice
on
the
khilafat
if
so
he
is
right
attainment
of
justice
is
undoubtedly
the
and
if
i
found
that
i
was
wrong
in
my
conception
of
justice
on
this
question
i
hope
i
shall
have
the
courage
immediately
to
retrace
my
steps
but
by
helping
the
mahomedans
of
india
at
a
critical
moment
in
their
history
i
want
to
buy
their
friendship
moreover
if
i
can
carry
the
mahomedans
with
me
i
hope
to
wean
great
britain
from
the
downward
path
along
which
the
prime
minister
seems
to
me
to
be
taking
her
i
hope
also
to
show
to
india
and
the
empire
at
large
that
given
a
certain
amount
of
capacity
for
justice
can
be
secured
by
peacefullest
and
cleanest
means
without
sowing
or
increasing
bitterness
between
english
and
indians
for
whatever
may
be
the
temporary
effect
of
my
methods
i
know
enough
of
them
to
feel
certain
that
they
alone
are
immune
from
lasting
bitterness
they
are
untainted
with
hatred
expedience
or
untruth
in
process
of
keeping
the
writer
of
topics
in
the
times
of
india
has
attempted
to
challenge
the
statement
made
in
my
khilafat
article
regarding
ministerial
pledges
and
in
doing
so
cites
asquith
speech
of
november
when
i
wrote
the
articles
i
had
in
mind
asquith
speech
i
am
sorry
that
he
ever
made
that
speech
for
in
my
humble
opinion
it
betrayed
to
say
the
least
a
confusion
of
thought
could
he
think
of
the
turkish
people
as
apart
from
the
ottoman
government
and
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
of
ottoman
dominion
in
europe
and
asia
if
it
be
not
the
death
knell
of
turkish
people
as
a
free
and
governing
race
is
it
again
true
historically
that
the
turkish
rule
has
always
been
a
blight
that
withered
some
of
the
fairest
regions
of
the
earth
and
what
is
the
meaning
of
his
statement
that
followed
nothing
is
further
from
our
thoughts
than
to
imitate
or
encourage
a
crusade
against
their
belief
if
words
have
any
meaning
the
qualifications
that
asquith
introduced
in
his
speech
should
have
meant
a
scrupulous
regard
for
indian
muslim
feeling
and
if
that
be
the
meaning
of
his
speech
without
anything
further
to
support
me
i
would
claim
that
even
asquith
assurance
is
in
danger
of
being
set
at
nought
if
the
resolutions
of
the
san
remo
conference
are
to
be
crystallised
into
action
but
i
base
remarks
on
a
considered
speech
made
by
asquith
successor
two
years
later
when
things
had
assumed
a
more
threatening
shape
than
in
and
when
the
need
for
indian
help
was
much
greater
than
in
his
pledge
would
bear
repetition
till
it
is
fulfilled
he
said
nor
are
we
fighting
to
deprive
turkey
of
its
capital
or
of
the
rich
and
renowned
lands
of
asia
minor
and
thrace
which
are
predominantly
turkish
in
race
we
do
not
challenge
the
maintenance
of
the
turkish
empire
in
the
homelands
of
the
turkish
race
with
its
capital
at
constantinople
if
only
every
word
of
this
pledge
is
fulfilled
both
in
letter
and
in
spirit
there
would
be
little
left
for
quarrelling
about
in
so
far
as
declaration
can
be
considered
hostile
to
the
indian
muslim
claim
it
its
superseded
by
the
later
and
more
considered
declaration
of
lloyd
george
a
declaration
made
irrevocable
by
fulfilment
of
the
consideration
it
expected
viz
the
enlistment
of
the
brave
mahomedan
soldiery
which
fought
in
the
very
place
which
is
now
being
partitioned
in
spite
of
the
pledge
but
the
writer
of
topics
says
lloyd
george
is
now
in
process
of
keeping
his
pledge
i
hope
he
is
right
but
what
has
already
happened
gives
little
ground
for
any
such
hope
for
imprisonment
or
internment
of
the
khalif
in
his
own
capital
will
be
not
only
a
mockery
of
fulfilment
but
it
would
he
adding
injury
to
insult
either
the
turkish
empire
is
to
be
maintained
in
the
homelands
of
the
turkish
race
with
its
capital
at
constantinople
or
it
is
not
if
it
is
let
the
indian
mahomedans
feel
the
full
glow
of
it
or
if
the
empire
is
to
be
broken
up
let
the
mask
of
hypocrisy
be
lifted
and
india
see
the
truth
in
its
nakedness
to
join
the
khilafat
movement
then
means
to
join
a
movement
to
keep
inviolate
the
pledge
of
a
british
minister
surely
such
a
movement
is
worth
much
greater
sacrifice
than
may
be
involved
in
appeal
to
the
viceroy
your
excellency
as
one
who
has
enjoyed
a
certain
measure
of
your
confidence
and
as
one
who
claims
to
be
a
devoted
of
the
british
empire
i
owe
it
to
your
excellency
and
through
your
excellency
to
his
majesty
ministers
to
explain
my
connection
with
and
my
conduct
in
the
khilafat
question
at
the
very
earliest
stages
of
the
war
even
whilst
i
was
in
london
organising
the
indian
volunteer
ambulance
corps
i
began
to
interest
myself
in
the
khilafat
question
i
perceived
how
deeply
moved
the
little
mussalman
world
in
london
was
when
turkey
decided
to
throw
in
her
lot
with
germany
on
my
arrival
in
india
in
the
january
of
i
found
the
same
anxiousness
and
earnestness
among
the
mussalmans
with
whom
i
came
in
contact
their
anxiety
became
intense
when
the
information
about
the
secret
treaties
leaked
out
distrust
of
british
intentions
filled
their
minds
and
despair
took
possession
of
them
even
at
that
moment
i
advised
my
mussalman
friends
not
to
give
way
to
despair
but
to
express
their
fear
and
their
hopes
in
a
disciplined
manner
it
will
be
admitted
that
the
whole
of
mussalman
india
has
behaved
in
a
singularly
restrained
manner
during
the
past
five
years
and
that
the
leaders
have
been
able
to
keep
the
turbulent
sections
of
their
community
under
complete
control
the
peace
terms
and
your
excellency
defence
of
them
have
given
the
mussalmans
of
india
a
shock
from
which
it
will
be
difficult
for
them
to
recover
the
terms
violate
ministerial
pledges
and
utterly
disregard
mussalman
sentiment
i
consider
that
as
a
staunch
hindu
wishing
to
live
on
terms
of
the
closest
friendship
with
my
mussalman
countrymen
i
should
be
an
unworthy
son
of
india
if
i
did
not
stand
by
them
in
their
hour
of
trial
in
my
humble
opinion
their
cause
is
just
they
claim
that
turkey
must
be
if
their
sentiment
is
to
be
respected
muslim
soldiers
did
fight
to
inflict
punishment
on
their
own
khalifa
or
to
deprive
him
of
his
territories
the
mussalman
attitude
has
been
consistent
throughout
these
five
years
my
duty
to
the
empire
to
which
i
owe
my
loyalty
requires
me
to
resist
the
cruel
violence
that
has
been
done
to
the
mussalman
sentiment
so
far
as
i
am
aware
mussulmans
and
hindus
have
as
a
whole
lost
faith
in
british
justice
and
honour
the
report
of
the
majority
of
the
hunter
committee
your
excellency
despatch
thereon
and
montagu
reply
have
only
aggravated
the
distrust
in
these
circumstances
the
only
course
open
to
one
like
me
is
either
in
despair
to
sever
all
connection
with
british
rule
or
if
i
still
retained
faith
in
the
inherent
superiority
of
the
british
constitution
to
all
others
at
present
in
vogue
to
adopt
such
means
as
will
rectify
the
wrong
done
and
thus
restore
confidence
i
have
not
lost
faith
in
such
superiority
and
i
am
not
without
hope
that
somehow
or
other
justice
will
yet
be
rendered
if
we
show
the
requisite
capacity
for
suffering
indeed
my
conception
of
that
constitution
is
that
it
helps
only
those
who
are
ready
to
help
themselves
i
do
not
believe
that
it
protects
the
weak
it
gives
free
scope
to
the
strong
to
maintain
their
strength
and
develop
it
the
weak
under
it
go
to
the
wall
it
is
then
because
i
believe
in
the
british
constitution
that
i
have
advised
my
mussalman
friends
to
withdraw
their
support
from
your
excellency
government
and
the
hindus
to
join
them
should
the
peace
terms
not
be
revised
in
accordance
with
the
solemn
pledges
of
ministers
and
the
muslim
sentiment
three
courses
were
open
to
the
mahomedans
in
order
to
mark
their
emphatic
disapproval
of
the
utter
injustice
to
which
his
ministers
have
become
party
if
they
have
not
actually
been
the
prime
perpetrators
of
it
they
are
to
resort
to
violence
to
advise
emigration
on
a
wholesale
scale
not
to
be
party
to
the
injustice
by
ceasing
to
with
the
government
your
excellency
must
be
aware
that
there
was
a
time
when
the
boldest
though
the
most
thoughtless
among
the
mussulmans
favoured
violence
and
the
hijrat
emigration
has
not
yet
ceased
to
be
the
i
venture
to
claim
that
i
have
succeeded
by
patient
reasoning
in
weaning
the
party
of
violence
from
its
ways
i
confess
that
i
did
not
i
did
not
attempt
to
succeed
in
weaning
them
from
violence
on
moral
grounds
but
purely
on
utilitarian
grounds
the
result
for
the
time
being
at
any
has
however
been
to
stop
violence
the
school
of
hijrat
has
received
a
check
if
it
has
not
stopped
its
activity
entirely
i
hold
that
no
repression
could
have
prevented
a
violent
eruption
if
the
people
had
not
had
presented
to
them
a
form
of
direct
action
involving
considerable
sacrifice
and
ensuring
success
if
such
direct
action
was
largely
taken
up
by
the
public
was
the
only
dignified
and
constitutional
form
of
such
direct
action
for
it
is
the
right
recognised
from
times
immemorial
of
the
subject
to
refuse
to
assist
a
ruler
who
misrules
at
the
same
time
i
admit
that
practised
by
the
mass
of
people
is
attended
with
grave
risks
but
in
a
crisis
such
as
has
overtaken
the
mussalmans
of
india
no
step
that
is
unattended
with
large
risks
can
possibly
bring
about
the
desired
change
not
to
run
some
risks
now
will
be
to
court
much
greater
risks
if
not
virtual
destruction
of
law
and
order
but
there
is
yet
an
escape
from
the
mussalman
representation
has
requested
your
excellency
to
lead
the
agitation
yourself
as
did
your
distinguished
predecessor
at
the
time
of
the
south
african
trouble
but
if
you
can
not
see
your
way
to
do
so
and
becomes
a
dire
necessity
i
hope
that
your
excellency
will
give
those
who
have
accepted
my
advice
and
myself
the
credit
for
being
actuated
by
nothing
less
than
a
stern
sense
of
duty

the
premier
reply
the
english
mail
has
brought
us
a
full
and
official
report
of
the
premier
speech
which
he
recently
made
when
he
received
the
khilafat
deputation
lloyd
george
speech
is
more
definite
and
therefore
more
disappointing
than
the
viceroy
reply
to
the
deputation
here
he
draws
quite
unwarranted
deductions
from
the
same
high
principles
on
which
he
had
based
his
own
pledge
only
two
years
ago
he
declares
that
turkey
must
pay
the
penalty
of
defeat
this
determination
to
punish
turkey
does
not
become
one
whose
immediate
predecessor
had
in
order
to
appease
muslim
soldiers
promised
that
the
british
government
had
no
designs
on
turkey
and
that
his
majesty
government
would
never
think
of
punishing
the
sultan
for
the
misdeeds
of
the
turkish
committee
lloyd
george
has
expressed
his
belief
that
the
majority
of
the
population
of
turkey
did
not
really
want
to
quarrel
with
great
britain
and
that
their
rulers
misled
the
country
in
spite
of
this
conviction
and
in
spite
of
asquith
promise
he
is
out
to
punish
turkey
and
punish
it
in
the
name
of
justice
he
expounds
the
principle
of
and
justifies
the
scheme
of
depriving
turkey
of
its
territories
one
after
another
while
justifying
this
scheme
he
does
not
exclude
even
thrace
and
this
strikes
the
reader
most
because
this
very
thrace
he
had
mentioned
in
his
pledge
as
predominantly
turkish
now
we
are
told
by
him
that
both
the
turkish
census
and
the
greek
census
agree
in
pointing
out
the
mussulman
population
in
thrace
is
in
a
considerable
minority
yakub
hussain

at

khilafat

challenged
the
truth
of
this
statement
the

cites
among
others
also
the
example
of
smyrna
where
he
says
we
had
a
most
careful
investigation
by
a
very
impartial
committee
in
the
whole
of
the
question
of
smyrna
and
it
was
found
that
considerable
majority
was
who
will
believe
the
impartial
committee
investigations
until
it
is
disproved
that
thousands
of
musselmans
have
been
murdered
and
hundreds
of
thousands
have
been
driven
away
from
their
hearths
and
homes
strangely
enough
lloyd
george
believes
in
the
necessity
of
fresh
investigations
by
a
purposely
appointed
committee
in
smyrna
as
the
most
authenticated
and
report
whereas
he
would
not
accept
mahomed
ali
proposal
for
an
impartial
commission
in
regard
to
armenian
massacre
doubtful
and
facts
and
figures
suffice
for
him
even
to
conclude
that
the
turkish
government
is
incapable
of
protecting
its
subjects
and
he
proceeds
to
suggest
foreign
interference
in
ruling
over
asia
minor
in
the
interests
of
civilization
here
he
cuts
at
the
root
of
the
sultan
independence
this
proposal
of
appropriating
supervision
is
distinctly
unlike
the
treatment
meted
out
to
other
enemy
powers
this
detraction
of
the
sultan
suzerainty
is
only
a
corollary
of
the
premier
indifference
towards
the
muslim
idea
of
the
caliphate
the
premier
injustice
in
treating
the
turkish
question
becomes
graver
when
he
thus
lightly
handles
the
khilafat
question
there
had
been
occasions
when
the
british
have
used
to
their
advantage
the
muslim
idea
of
associating
the
caliph
spiritual
power
with
temporal
power
now
this
very
association
is
treated
as
a
controversial
question
by
the
great
statesman
will
this
raise
the
reputation
of
great
britain
or
stain
it
can
this
be
tolerated
by
those
who
fought
against
turkey
with
full
faith
in
british
honesty
mere
receipts
of
gratitude
can
not
console
the
wounded
mussalmans
there
lies
the
alternative
for
england
to
choose
between
two
mandates
a
mandate
over
some
turkish
territories
which
is
sure
to
lead
to
chaos
all
over
the
world
and
a
mandate
over
the
hearts
of
the
muhomedans
which
will
redeem
the
pledged
honour
of
britain
the
prime
minister
has
an
unwise
choice
this
narrow
view
registers
the
latest
temperature
of
british
diplomacy
the
mussulman
representation
slowly
but
surely
the
mussulmans
are
preparing
for
the
battle
before
them
they
have
to
fight
against
odds
that
are
undoubtedly
heavy
but
not
half
as
heavy
as
the
prophet
had
against
him
how
often
did
he
not
put
his
life
in
danger
but
his
faith
in
god
was
unquenchable
he
went
forward
with
a
light
heart
for
god
was
on
his
side
for
he
represented
truth
if
his
followers
have
half
the
prophet
faith
and
half
his
spirit
of
sacrifice
the
odds
will
be
presently
even
and
will
in
little
while
turn
against
the
despoilers
of
turkey
already
the
rapacity
of
the
allies
is
telling
against
themselves
france
finds
her
task
difficult
greece
can
not
stomach
her
gains
and
england
finds
mesopotamia
a
tough
job
the
oil
of
mosul
may
feed
the
fire
she
has
so
wantonly
lighted
and
burn
her
fingers
badly
the
newspapers
say
the
arabs
do
not
like
the
presence
of
the
indian
soldiery
in
their
midst
i
do
not
wonder
they
are
a
fierce
and
a
brave
people
and
do
not
understand
why
indian
soldiers
should
find
themselves
in
mesopotamia
whatever
the
fate
of
i
wish
that
not
a
single
indian
will
offer
his
services
for
mesopotamia
whether
for
the
civil
or
the
military
department
we
must
learn
to
think
for
ourselves
and
before
entering
upon
any
employment
find
out
whether
thereby
we
may
not
make
ourselves
instruments
of
injustice
apart
from
the
question
of
khilafat
and
from
the
point
of
abstract
justice
the
english
have
no
right
to
hold
mesopotamia
it
is
no
part
of
our
loyalty
to
help
the
imperial
government
in
what
is
in
plain
language
daylight
robbery
if
therefore
we
seek
civil
or
military
employment
in
mesopotamia
we
do
so
for
the
sake
of
earning
a
livelihood
it
is
our
duty
to
see
that
the
source
is
not
tainted
it
surprises
me
to
find
so
many
people
shirking
over
the
mention
of
there
is
no
instrument
so
clean
so
harmless
and
yet
so
effective
as
judiciously
hauled
it
need
not
produce
any
evil
consequences
and
its
intensity
will
depend
purely
on
the
capacity
of
the
people
for
sacrifice
the
chief
thing
is
to
prepare
the
atmosphere
of
we
are
not
going
to
with
you
in
your
injustice
is
surely
the
right
and
the
duty
of
every
intelligent
subject
to
say
were
it
not
for
our
utter
servility
helplessness
and
want
of
confidence
in
ourselves
we
would
certainly
grasp
this
clean
weapon
and
make
the
most
effective
use
of
it
even
the
most
despotic
government
can
not
stand
except
for
the
consent
of
the
governed
which
consent
is
often
forcibly
procured
by
the
despot
immediately
the
subject
ceases
to
fear
the
despotic
force
his
power
is
gone
but
the
british
government
is
never
and
nowhere
entirely
or
laid
upon
force
it
does
make
an
honest
attempt
to
secure
the
goodwill
of
the
governed
but
it
does
not
hesitate
to
adopt
unscrupulous
means
to
compel
the
consent
of
the
governed
it
has
not
gone
beyond
the
is
the
best
policy
idea
it
therefore
bribes
you
into
consenting
its
will
by
awarding
titles
medals
and
ribbons
by
giving
you
employment
by
its
superior
financial
ability
to
open
for
its
employees
avenues
for
enriching
themselves
and
finally
when
these
fail
it
resorts
to
force
that
is
what
sir
michael
did
and
that
is
almost
every
british
administrator
will
certainly
do
if
he
thought
it
necessary
if
then
we
would
not
be
greedy
if
we
would
not
run
after
titles
and
medals
and
honorary
posts
which
do
the
country
no
good
half
the
battle
is
won
my
advisers
are
never
tired
of
telling
me
that
even
if
the
turkish
peace
terms
are
revised
it
will
not
be
due
to
i
venture
to
suggest
to
them
that
has
a
higher
purpose
than
mere
revision
of
the
terms
if
i
can
not
compel
revision
i
must
at
least
cease
to
support
a
government
that
becomes
party
to
the
usurpation
and
if
i
succeed
in
pushing
to
the
extreme
limit
i
do
compel
the
government
to
choose
between
india
and
the
usurpation
i
have
faith
enough
in
england
to
know
that
at
that
moment
england
will
expel
her
present
jaded
ministers
and
put
in
others
who
will
make
a
clean
sweep
of
the
terms
in
consultation
with
an
awakened
india
draft
terms
that
will
be
honourable
to
her
to
turkey
and
acceptable
to
india
but
i
hear
my
critics
say
india
has
not
the
strength
of
purpose
and
the
capacity
for
the
sacrifice
to
achieve
such
a
noble
end
they
are
partly
right
india
has
not
these
qualities
now
because
we
have
not
shall
we
not
evolve
them
and
infect
the
nation
with
them
is
not
the
attempt
worth
making
is
my
sacrifice
too
great
to
gain
such
a
great
purpose
criticism
of
the
muslim
manifesto
the
khilafat
representation
addressed
to
the
viceroy
and
my
letter
on
the
same
subject
have
been
severely
criticised
by
the
press
times
of
which
generally
adopts
an
impartial
attitude
has
taken
strong
exception
to
certain
statements
made
in
the
muslim
manifesto
and
has
devoted
a
paragraph
of
its
article
to
an
advance
criticism
of
my
suggestion
that
his
excellency
should
resign
if
the
peace
terms
are
not
revised
times
of
excepts
to
the
submission
that
the
british
empire
may
not
treat
turkey
like
a
departed
enemy
the
signatories
have
i
think
supplied
the
best
of
reasons
they
say
we
respectfully
submit
that
in
the
treatment
of
turkey
the
british
government
are
bound
to
respect
indian
muslim
sentiment
in
so
far
as
it
is
neither
unjust
nor
unreasonable
if
the
seven
crore
mussulmans
are
partners
in
the
empire
i
submit
that
their
wish
must
be
held
to
be
all
sufficient
for
refraining
from
punishing
turkey
it
is
beside
the
point
to
quote
what
turkey
did
during
the
war
it
has
suffered
for
it
inquires
wherein
turkey
has
been
treated
worse
than
the
other
powers
i
thought
that
the
fact
was
neither
germany
nor
austria
and
hungary
has
been
treated
in
the
same
way
that
turkey
has
been
the
whole
of
the
empire
has
been
reduced
to
the
retention
of
a
portion
of
its
capital
as
it
were
to
mock
the
sultan
and
that
too
has
been
done
under
terms
so
humiliating
that
no
person
much
less
a
reigning
sovereign
can
possibly
accept
has
endeavoured
to
make
capital
out
of
the
fact
that
the
representation
does
not
examine
the
reason
for
turkey
not
joining
the
allies
well
there
was
no
mystery
about
it
the
fact
of
russia
being
one
of
the
allies
was
enough
to
warn
turkey
against
joining
them
with
russia
knocking
at
the
gate
at
the
time
of
the
war
it
was
not
an
easy
matter
for
turkey
to
join
the
allies
but
turkey
had
cause
to
suspect
great
britain
herself
she
knew
that
england
had
done
no
friendly
turn
to
her
during
the
bulgarian
war
she
was
hardly
well
served
at
the
time
of
the
war
with
italy
it
was
still
no
doubt
a
bad
choice
with
the
musssalmans
of
india
awakened
and
ready
to
support
her
her
statesmen
might
have
relied
upon
britain
not
being
allowed
to
damage
turkey
if
she
had
remained
with
the
allies
but
this
is
all
wisdom
after
event
turkey
made
a
bad
choice
and
she
was
punished
for
it
to
humiliate
her
now
is
to
ignore
the
indian
mussulman
sentiment
britain
may
not
do
it
and
retain
the
loyalty
of
the
awakened
mussulmans
of
india
for
the
times
to
say
that
the
peace
terms
strictly
follow
the
principle
of
is
to
throw
dust
in
the
eyes
of
its
readers
is
it
the
principle
of
that
has
caused
the
cessation
of
adrianople
and
thrace
to
greece
by
what
principle
of
has
smyrna
been
handed
to
greece
have
the
inhabitants
of
thrace
and
smyrna
asked
for
grecian
tutelege
i
decline
to
believe
that
the
arabs
like
the
disposition
that
has
been
made
of
them
who
is
the
king
of
hedjaj
and
who
is
emir
feisul
have
the
arabs
elected
these
kings
and
chiefs
do
the
arabs
like
the
mandate
being
taken
by
england
by
the
time
the
whole
thing
is
finished
the
very
name
will
stink
in
one
nostrils
already
signs
are
not
wanting
to
show
that
the
arabs
the
thracians
and
the
smyrnans
are
resenting
their
disposal
they
may
not
like
turkish
rule
but
they
like
the
present
arrangement
less
they
could
have
made
their
own
honourable
terms
with
turkey
but
these
people
will
now
be
held
down
by
the
might
of
the
allied
british
forces
britain
had
the
straight
course
open
to
her
of
keeping
the
turkish
empire
intact
and
taking
sufficient
guarantees
for
good
government
but
her
prime
minister
chose
the
crooked
course
of
secret
treaties
duplicity
and
hypocritical
subterfuges
there
is
still
a
way
out
let
her
treat
india
as
a
real
partner
let
her
call
the
true
representatives
of
the
mussalmans
let
them
go
to
arabia
and
the
other
parts
of
the
turkish
empire
and
let
her
devise
a
scheme
that
would
not
humiliate
turkey
that
would
satisfy
the
just
muslim
sentiment
and
that
will
secure
honest
for
the
races
composing
that
empire
if
it
was
canada
australia
or
south
africa
that
had
to
be
placated
lloyd
george
would
not
have
dared
to
ignore
them
they
have
the
power
to
secede
india
has
not
let
him
no
more
insult
india
by
calling
her
a
partner
if
her
feelings
count
for
naught
i
invite
times
of
to
reconsider
its
position
and
join
an
honourable
agitation
in
which
a
people
are
seeking
nothing
but
justice
i
do
with
all
deference
still
suggest
that
the
least
that
lord
chelmsford
can
do
is
to
resign
if
the
sacred
feelings
of
india
sons
are
not
to
be
consulted
and
respected
by
the
ministers
is
the
constitution
when
it
suggests
that
as
a
constitutional
viceroy
it
is
not
open
to
lord
chelmsford
to
go
against
the
decision
of
his
majesty
ministers
it
is
certainly
not
open
to
a
viceroy
to
retain
office
and
oppose
ministerial
decisions
but
the
constitution
does
allow
a
viceroy
to
resign
his
high
office
when
he
is
called
upon
to
carry
out
decisions
that
are
immoral
as
the
peace
terms
are
or
like
these
terms
are
calculated
to
stir
to
their
very
depth
the
feelings
of
those
whose
affair
he
is
administering
for
the
time
being
the
mahomedan
decision
the
khilafat
meeting
at
allahabad
has
unanimously
reaffirmed
the
principle
of
and
appointed
an
executive
committee
to
lay
down
and
enforce
a
detailed
programme
this
meeting
was
preceded
by
a
joint
meeting
at
which
hindu
leaders
were
invited
to
give
their
views
beasant
the
pandit
malaviyuji
the
sapru
motilal
nehru
chintamani
and
others
were
present
at
the
meeting
it
was
a
wise
step
on
the
part
of
the
khilafat
committee
to
invite
hindus
representing
all
shades
of
thought
to
give
them
the
benefit
of
their
advice
besant
and
sapru
strongly
dissuaded
the
mahomedans
present
from
the
policy
of
the
other
hindu
speakers
made
speeches
whilst
the
other
hindu
speakers
approved
of
the
principle
of
in
theory
they
saw
many
practical
difficulties
and
they
feared
also
complications
arising
from
mahomedans
welcoming
an
afghan
invasion
of
india
the
mahomedan
speakers
gave
the
fullest
and
frankest
assurances
that
they
would
fight
to
a
man
any
invader
who
wanted
to
conquer
india
but
were
equally
frank
in
asserting
that
any
invasion
from
without
undertaken
with
a
view
to
uphold
the
prestige
of
islam
and
to
vindicate
justice
would
have
their
full
sympathy
if
not
their
actual
support
it
is
easy
enough
to
understand
and
justify
the
hindu
caution
it
is
difficult
to
resist
mahomedan
position
in
my
opinion
the
best
way
to
prevent
india
from
becoming
the
battle
ground
between
the
forces
of
islam
and
those
of
the
english
is
for
hindus
to
make
a
complete
and
immediate
success
and
i
have
little
doubt
that
if
the
mahomedans
remain
true
to
their
declared
intention
and
are
able
to
exercise
and
make
sacrifices
the
hindus
will
play
the
game
and
join
them
in
the
campaign
of
i
feel
equally
certain
that
the
hindus
will
not
assist
mahomedans
in
promoting
or
bringing
about
an
armed
conflict
between
the
british
government
and
their
allies
and
afghanistan
british
forces
are
too
well
organised
to
admit
of
any
successful
invasion
of
the
indian
frontier
the
only
way
therefore
the
mahomedans
can
carry
on
an
effective
struggle
on
behalf
of
the
honour
of
islam
is
to
take
up
in
real
earnest
it
will
not
only
be
completely
effective
if
it
is
adopted
by
the
people
on
an
extensive
scale
but
it
will
also
provide
full
scope
for
individual
conscience
if
i
can
not
bear
an
injustice
done
by
an
individual
or
a
corporation
and
if
i
am
directly
or
indirectly
instrumental
in
upholding
that
individual
or
corporation
i
must
answer
for
it
before
my
maker
but
i
have
done
all
it
is
humanly
possible
for
me
to
do
consistently
with
the
moral
code
that
refuses
to
injure
even
the
if
i
cease
to
support
the
injustice
in
the
manner
described
above
in
applying
therefore
such
a
great
force
there
should
be
no
haste
there
should
be
no
temper
shown
must
be
and
remain
absolutely
a
voluntary
effort
the
whole
thing
then
depends
upon
mahomedans
themselves
if
they
will
but
help
themselves
hindu
help
will
come
and
the
government
great
and
mighty
though
it
is
will
have
to
bend
before
this
irresistible
force
no
government
can
possibly
withstand
the
bloodless
opposition
of
a
whole
nation
andrews
difficulty
andrews
whose
love
for
india
is
equalled
only
by
his
love
for
england
and
whose
mission
in
life
is
to
serve
god
humanity
through
india
has
contributed
remarkable
articles
to
the
chronicle
on
the
khilafat
movement
he
has
not
spared
england
france
or
italy
he
has
shown
how
turkey
has
been
most
unjustly
dealt
with
and
how
the
prime
minister
pledge
has
been
broken
he
has
devoted
the
last
article
to
an
examination
of
mahomed
ali
letter
to
the
sultan
and
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
mahomed
ali
statement
of
claim
is
at
variance
with
the
claim
set
forth
in
the
latest
khilafat
representation
to
the
viceroy
which
he
wholly
approves
andrews
and
i
have
discussed
the
question
as
fully
as
it
was
possible
he
asked
me
publicly
to
define
my
own
position
more
fully
than
i
have
done
his
sole
object
in
inviting
discussion
is
to
give
strength
to
a
cause
which
he
holds
as
intrinsically
just
and
to
gather
round
it
the
best
opinion
of
europe
so
that
the
allied
powers
and
especially
england
may
for
very
shame
be
obliged
to
revise
the
terms
i
gladly
respond
to
andrew
invitation
i
should
clear
the
ground
by
stating
that
i
reject
any
religious
doctrine
that
does
not
appeal
to
reason
and
is
in
conflict
with
morality
i
tolerate
unreasonable
religious
sentiment
when
it
is
not
immoral
i
hold
the
khilafat
claim
to
be
both
just
and
reasonable
and
therefore
it
derives
greater
force
because
it
has
behind
it
the
religious
sentiment
of
the
mussalman
world
in
my
opinion
mahomed
ali
statement
is
unexceptionable
it
is
no
doubt
clothed
in
diplomatic
language
but
i
am
not
prepared
to
quarrel
with
the
language
so
long
as
it
is
sound
in
substance
andrews
considers
that
mahomed
ali
language
goes
to
show
that
he
would
resist
armenian
independence
against
the
armenians
and
the
arabian
against
the
arabs
i
attach
no
such
meaning
to
it
what
he
the
whole
of
mussalmans
and
therefore
i
think
also
the
hindus
resist
is
the
shameless
attempt
of
england
and
the
other
powers
under
cover
of
to
emasculate
and
dismember
turkey
if
i
understand
the
spirit
of
islam
properly
it
is
essentially
republican
in
the
truest
sense
of
the
term
therefore
if
armenia
or
arabia
desired
independence
of
turkey
they
should
have
it
in
the
case
of
arabia
complete
arabian
independence
would
mean
transference
of
the
khilafat
to
an
arab
chieftain
arabia
in
that
sense
is
a
mussulman
trust
not
purely
arabian
and
the
arabs
without
ceasing
to
be
mussulman
could
not
hold
arabia
against
muslim
opinion
the
khalifa
must
be
the
custodian
of
the
holy
places
and
therefore
also
the
routes
to
them
he
must
be
able
to
defend
them
against
the
whole
world
and
if
an
arab
chief
arose
who
could
better
satisfy
that
test
than
the
sultan
of
turkey
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
would
be
recognised
as
the
khalifa
i
have
thus
discussed
the
question
academically
the
fact
is
that
neither
the
mussulmans
nor
the
hindus
believe
in
the
english
ministerial
word
they
do
not
believe
that
the
arabs
or
the
armenians
want
complete
independence
of
turkey
that
they
want
is
beyond
doubt
nobody
disputes
that
claim
but
nobody
has
ever
ascertained
that
either
the
arabs
or
the
armenians
desire
to
do
away
with
all
connection
even
nominal
with
turkey
the
solution
of
the
question
lies
not
in
our
academic
discussion
of
the
ideal
position
it
lies
in
an
honest
appointment
of
a
mixed
commission
of
absolutely
independent
indian
mussulmans
and
hindus
and
independent
europeans
to
investigate
the
real
wish
of
the
armenians
and
the
arabs
and
then
to
come
to
a
where
by
the
claims
of
the
nationality
and
those
of
islam
may
be
adjusted
and
satisfied
it
is
common
knowledge
that
smyrna
and
thrace
including
adrianople
have
been
dishonestly
taken
away
from
turkey
and
that
mandates
have
been
unscrupulously
established
in
syria
and
mesopotamia
and
a
british
nominee
has
been
set
up
in
hedjaj
under
the
protection
of
british
guns
this
is
a
position
that
is
intolerable
and
unjust
apart
therefore
from
the
questions
of
armenia
and
arabia
the
dishonesty
and
hypocrisy
that
pollute
the
peace
terms
require
to
be
instantaneously
removed
it
paves
the
way
to
an
equitable
solution
of
the
question
of
armenian
and
arabian
independence
which
in
theory
no
one
denies
and
which
in
practice
may
be
easily
guaranteed
if
only
the
wishes
of
the
people
concerned
could
with
any
degree
of
certainty
be
ascertained
the
khilafat
agitation
a
friend
who
has
been
listening
to
my
speeches
once
asked
me
whether
i
did
not
come
under
the
sedition
section
of
the
indian
penal
code
though
i
had
not
fully
considered
it
i
told
him
that
very
probably
i
did
and
that
i
could
not
plead
guilty
if
i
was
charged
under
it
for
i
must
admit
that
i
can
pretend
to
no
for
the
present
government
and
my
speeches
are
intended
to
create
such
that
the
people
might
consider
it
a
shame
to
assist
or
with
a
government
that
had
forfeited
all
title
to
confidence
respect
or
support
i
draw
no
distinction
between
the
imperial
and
the
indian
government
the
latter
has
accepted
on
the
khilafat
the
policy
imposed
upon
it
by
the
former
and
in
the
punjab
case
the
former
has
endorsed
the
policy
of
terrorism
and
emasculation
of
a
brave
people
initiated
by
the
latter
british
ministers
have
broken
their
pledged
word
and
wantonly
wounded
the
feelings
of
the
seventy
million
mussulmans
of
india
innocent
men
and
women
were
insulted
by
the
insolent
officers
of
the
punjab
government
their
wrongs
not
only
remain
unrighted
but
the
very
officers
who
so
cruelly
subjected
them
to
barbarous
humiliation
retain
office
under
the
government
when
at
amritsar
last
year
i
pleaded
with
all
the
earnestness
i
could
command
for
with
the
government
and
for
response
to
the
wishes
expressed
in
the
royal
proclamation
i
did
so
because
i
honestly
believed
that
a
new
era
was
about
to
begin
and
that
the
old
spirit
of
fear
distrust
and
consequent
terrorism
was
about
to
give
place
to
the
new
spirit
of
respect
trust
and
goodwill
i
sincerely
believed
that
the
mussulman
sentiment
would
be
placated
and
that
the
officers
that
had
misbehaved
during
the
martial
law
regime
in
the
punjab
would
be
at
least
dismissed
and
the
people
would
be
otherwise
made
to
feel
that
a
government
that
had
always
been
found
quick
and
mighty
to
punish
popular
excesses
would
not
fail
to
punish
its
agents
misdeeds
but
to
my
amazement
and
dismay
i
have
discovered
that
the
present
representatives
of
the
empire
have
become
dishonest
and
unscrupulous
they
have
no
real
regard
for
the
wishes
of
the
people
of
india
and
they
count
indian
honour
as
of
little
consequence
i
can
no
longer
retain
affection
for
a
government
so
evilly
manned
as
it
is
and
for
me
it
is
humiliating
to
retain
my
freedom
and
be
witness
to
the
continuing
wrong
montagu
however
is
certainly
right
in
threatening
me
with
deprivation
of
my
liberty
if
i
persist
in
endangering
the
existence
of
the
government
for
that
must
be
the
result
if
my
activity
bears
fruit
my
only
regret
is
that
inasmuch
as
montagu
admits
my
past
services
he
might
have
perceived
that
there
must
be
something
exceptionally
bad
in
the
government
if
a
like
me
could
no
longer
give
his
affection
to
it
it
was
simpler
to
insist
on
justice
being
done
to
the
mussalmans
and
to
the
punjab
than
to
threaten
me
with
punishment
so
that
the
injustice
might
be
perpetuated
indeed
i
fully
expect
it
will
be
found
that
even
in
promoting
disaffection
towards
an
unjust
government
i
had
rendered
greater
services
to
the
empire
than
i
am
already
credited
with
at
the
present
moment
however
the
duty
of
those
who
approve
my
activity
is
clear
they
ought
on
no
account
to
resent
the
deprivation
of
my
liberty
should
the
government
of
india
deem
it
to
be
their
duty
to
take
it
away
a
citizen
has
no
right
to
resist
such
restriction
imposed
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
state
to
which
he
belongs
much
less
have
those
who
sympathise
with
him
in
my
case
there
can
be
no
question
of
sympathy
for
i
deliberately
oppose
the
government
to
the
extent
of
trying
to
put
its
very
existence
in
jeopardy
for
my
supporters
therefore
it
must
be
a
moment
of
joy
when
i
am
imprisoned
it
means
the
beginning
of
success
if
only
the
supporters
continue
the
policy
for
which
i
stand
if
the
government
arrest
me
they
would
do
so
in
order
to
stop
the
progress
of
which
i
preach
it
follows
that
if
continues
with
unabated
vigour
even
after
my
arrest
the
government
must
imprison
others
or
grant
the
people
wish
in
order
to
gain
their
any
eruption
of
violence
on
the
part
of
the
people
even
under
provocation
would
end
in
disaster
whether
therefore
it
is
i
or
any
one
else
who
is
arrested
during
the
campaign
the
first
condition
of
success
is
that
there
must
be
no
resentment
shown
against
it
we
can
not
imperil
the
very
existence
of
a
government
and
quarrel
with
its
attempt
to
save
itself
by
punishing
those
who
place
it
in
danger
hijarat
and
its
meaning
india
is
a
continent
its
articulate
thousands
know
what
its
inarticulate
millions
are
doing
or
thinking
the
government
and
the
educated
indians
may
think
that
the
khilafat
movement
is
merely
a
passing
phase
the
millions
of
mussalmans
think
otherwise
the
flight
of
the
mussalmans
is
growing
apace
the
newspapers
contain
paragraphs
in
out
of
the
way
corners
informing
the
readers
that
a
special
train
containing
a
barrister
with
sixty
women
forty
children
including
twenty
sucklings
all
told
have
left
for
afghanistan
they
were
cheered
they
were
presented
with
cash
edibles
and
other
things
and
were
joined
by
more
muhajarins
on
the
way
no
fanatical
preaching
by
shaukatali
can
make
people
break
up
and
leave
their
homes
for
an
unknown
land
there
must
be
an
abiding
faith
in
them
that
it
is
better
for
them
to
leave
a
state
which
has
no
regard
for
their
religious
sentiment
and
face
a
beggar
life
than
to
remain
in
it
even
though
it
may
be
in
a
princely
manner
nothing
but
pride
of
power
can
blind
the
government
of
india
to
the
scene
that
is
being
enacted
before
it
but
there
is
yet
another
side
to
the
movement
here
are
the
facts
as
stated
in
the
following
government
dated
july
an
unfortunate
affair
in
connection
with
the
mahajarin
occurred
on
the
instant
at
kacha
garhi
between
peshawar
and
jamrud
the
following
are
the
facts
as
at
present
reported
two
members
of
a
party
of
the
mahajarins
proceeding
by
train
to
jamrud
were
detected
by
the
british
military
police
travelling
without
tickets
altercation
ensued
at
islamia
college
station
but
the
train
proceeded
to
kacha
garhi
an
attempt
was
made
to
evict
these
mahajarins
whereupon
the
military
police
were
attacked
by
a
crowd
of
some
forty
mahajarins
and
the
british
officer
who
intervened
was
seriously
wounded
with
a
spade
a
detachment
of
indian
troops
at
kacha
garhi
thereupon
fired
two
or
three
shots
at
the
mahajarin
for
making
murderous
assault
on
the
british
officer
one
mahajarin
was
killed
and
one
wounded
and
three
arrested
both
the
military
and
the
police
were
injured
the
body
of
the
mahajarin
was
despatched
to
peshawar
and
buried
on
the
morning
of
the
this
incident
has
caused
considerable
excitement
in
peshawar
city
and
the
khilafat
hijrat
committee
are
exercising
restraining
influence
shops
were
closed
on
the
morning
of
the
a
full
enquiry
has
been
instituted
now
peshawar
to
jamrud
is
a
matter
of
a
few
miles
it
was
clearly
the
duty
of
the
military
not
to
attempt
to
pull
out
the
ticketless
mahajarins
for
the
sake
of
a
few
annas
but
they
actually
attempted
force
intervention
by
the
rest
of
the
party
was
a
foregone
conclusion
an
altercation
ensued
a
british
officer
was
attacked
with
a
spade
firing
and
a
death
of
a
mahajarin
was
the
result
has
british
prestige
been
enhanced
by
the
episode
why
have
not
the
government
put
tactful
officers
in
charge
at
the
frontier
whilst
a
great
religious
emigration
is
in
progress
the
action
of
the
military
will
pass
from
tongue
to
tongue
throughout
india
and
the
mussalman
world
around
will
not
doubt
be
unconsciously
and
even
consciously
exaggerated
in
the
passage
and
the
feeling
bitter
as
it
already
is
will
grow
in
bitterness
the
says
that
the
government
are
making
further
inquiry
let
us
hope
that
it
will
be
full
and
that
better
arrangements
will
be
made
to
prevent
a
repetition
of
what
appears
to
have
been
a
thoughtless
act
on
the
part
of
the
military
and
may
i
draw
the
attention
of
those
who
are
opposing
that
unless
they
find
out
a
substitute
they
should
either
join
the
movement
or
prepare
to
face
a
disorganised
subterranean
upheaval
whose
effect
no
one
can
foresee
and
whose
spread
it
would
be
impossible
to
check
or
regulate
iii
the
punjab
wrongs
political
freemasonry
freemasonry
is
a
secret
brotherhood
which
has
more
by
its
secret
and
iron
rules
than
by
its
service
to
humanity
obtained
a
hold
upon
some
of
the
best
minds
similarly
there
seems
to
be
some
secret
code
of
conduct
governing
the
official
class
in
india
before
which
the
flower
of
the
great
british
nation
fall
prostrate
and
unconsciously
become
instruments
of
injustice
which
as
private
individuals
they
would
be
ashamed
of
perpetrating
in
no
other
way
is
it
possible
for
one
to
understand
the
majority
report
of
the
hunter
committee
the
despatch
of
the
government
of
india
and
the
reply
thereto
of
the
secretary
of
state
for
india
in
spite
of
the
energetic
protests
of
a
section
of
the
press
to
the
personnel
of
the
committee
it
might
be
said
that
on
the
whole
the
public
were
prepared
to
trust
it
especially
as
it
contained
three
indian
members
who
could
fairly
be
claimed
to
be
independent
the
first
rude
shock
to
this
confidence
was
delivered
by
the
refusal
of
lord
committee
to
accept
the
very
moderate
and
reasonable
demand
of
the
congress
committee
that
the
imprisoned
punjab
leaders
might
be
allowed
to
appear
before
it
to
instruct
counsel
any
doubt
that
might
have
been
left
in
the
mind
of
any
person
has
been
dispelled
by
the
report
of
the
majority
of
that
committee
the
result
has
justified
the
attitude
of
the
congress
committee
the
evidence
collected
by
it
shows
what
lord
hunter
committee
purposely
denied
itself
the
minority
report
stands
out
like
an
oasis
in
a
desert
the
indian
members
deserve
the
congratulation
of
their
countrymen
for
having
dared
to
do
their
duty
in
the
face
of
heavy
odds
i
wish
that
they
had
refused
to
associate
themselves
even
in
a
modified
manner
with
the
condemnation
of
the
civil
disobedience
form
of
satyagraha
the
defiant
spirit
of
the
delhi
mob
on
the
march
can
hardly
be
used
for
condemning
a
great
spiritual
movement
which
is
admittedly
and
manifestly
intended
to
restrain
the
violent
tendencies
of
mobs
and
to
replace
criminal
lawlessness
by
civil
disobedience
of
authority
when
it
has
forfeited
all
title
to
respect
on
the
march
civil
disobedience
had
not
even
been
started
almost
every
great
popular
demonstration
has
been
hitherto
attended
all
the
world
over
by
a
certain
amount
of
lawlessness
the
demonstration
of
march
and
april
could
have
been
held
under
any
other
aegis
us
under
that
of
satyagrah
i
hold
that
without
the
advent
of
the
spirit
of
civility
and
orderliness
the
disobedience
would
have
taken
a
much
more
violent
form
than
it
did
even
at
delhi
it
was
only
the
wonderfully
quick
acceptance
by
the
people
of
the
principle
of
satyagrah
that
effectively
checked
the
spread
of
violence
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
india
and
even
it
is
not
the
memory
of
the
black
barbarity
of
general
dyer
that
is
keeping
the
undoubted
restlessness
among
the
people
from
breaking
forth
into
violence
the
hold
that
satyagrah
has
gained
on
the
people
it
may
be
even
against
their
will
is
curbing
the
forces
of
disorder
and
violence
but
i
must
not
detain
the
reader
on
a
defence
of
satyagrah
against
unjust
attacks
if
it
has
gained
a
foothold
in
india
it
will
survive
much
fiercer
attacks
than
the
one
made
by
the
majority
of
the
hunter
committee
and
somewhat
supported
by
the
minority
had
the
majority
report
been
defective
only
in
this
direction
and
correct
in
every
other
there
would
have
been
nothing
but
praise
for
it
after
all
satyagrah
is
a
new
experiment
in
political
field
and
a
hasty
attributing
to
it
of
any
popular
disorder
would
have
been
pardonable
the
universally
pronounced
adverse
judgment
upon
the
report
and
the
despatches
rests
upon
far
more
painful
revelations
look
at
the
manifestly
laboured
defence
of
every
official
act
of
inhumanity
except
where
condemnation
could
not
be
avoided
through
the
impudent
admissions
made
by
the
actors
themselves
look
at
the
special
pleading
introduced
to
defend
general
dyer
even
against
himself
look
at
the
vain
glorification
of
sir
michael
although
it
was
his
spirit
that
actuated
every
act
of
criminality
on
the
part
of
the
subordinates
look
at
the
deliberate
refusal
to
examine
his
wild
career
before
the
events
of
april
his
acts
were
an
open
book
of
which
the
committee
ought
to
have
taken
judicial
notices
instead
of
accepting
everything
that
the
officials
had
to
say
the
committee
obvious
duty
was
to
tax
itself
to
find
out
the
real
cause
of
the
disorders
it
ought
to
have
gone
out
of
its
way
to
search
out
the
inwardness
of
the
events
instead
of
patiently
going
behind
the
hard
crust
of
official
documents
the
committee
allowed
itself
to
be
guided
with
criminal
laziness
by
mere
official
evidence
the
report
and
the
despatches
in
my
humble
opinion
constitute
an
attempt
to
condone
official
lawlessness
the
cautious
and
condemnation
pronounced
upon
general
dyer
massacre
and
the
notorious
crawling
order
only
deepens
the
disappointment
of
the
reader
as
he
goes
through
page
after
page
of
thinly
disguised
official
whitewash
i
need
however
scarcely
attempt
any
elaborate
examination
of
the
report
or
the
despatches
which
have
been
so
justly
censured
by
the
whole
national
press
whether
of
the
moderate
or
the
extremist
hue
the
point
to
consider
is
how
to
break
down
this
secret
be
the
secrecy
over
so
unconscious
conspiracy
to
uphold
official
iniquity
a
scandal
of
this
magnitude
can
not
be
tolerated
by
the
nation
if
it
is
to
preserve
its
and
become
a
free
partner
in
the
empire
the
congress
committee
has
resolved
upon
convening
a
special
session
of
the
congress
for
the
purpose
of
considering
among
other
things
the
situation
arising
from
the
report
in
my
opinion
the
time
has
arrived
when
we
must
cease
to
rely
upon
mere
petition
to
parliament
for
effective
action
petitions
will
have
value
when
the
nation
has
behind
it
the
power
to
enforce
its
will
what
power
then
have
we
when
we
are
firmly
of
opinion
that
grave
wrong
has
been
done
us
and
when
after
an
appeal
to
the
highest
authority
we
fail
to
secure
redress
there
must
be
some
power
available
to
us
for
undoing
the
wrong
it
is
true
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
it
is
the
duty
of
a
subject
to
submit
to
wrongs
on
failure
of
the
usual
procedure
so
long
as
they
do
not
affect
his
vital
being
but
every
nation
and
every
individual
has
the
right
and
it
is
their
duty
to
rise
against
an
intolerable
wrong
i
do
not
believe
in
armed
risings
they
are
a
remedy
worse
than
the
disease
sought
to
be
cured
they
are
a
token
of
the
spirit
of
revenge
and
impatience
and
anger
the
method
of
violence
can
not
do
good
in
the
long
run
witness
the
effect
of
the
armed
rising
of
the
allied
powers
against
germany
have
they
not
become
even
like
the
germans
as
the
latter
have
been
depicted
to
us
by
them
we
have
a
better
method
unlike
that
of
violence
it
certainly
involves
the
exercise
of
restraint
and
patience
but
it
requires
also
resoluteness
of
will
this
method
is
to
refuse
to
be
party
to
the
wrong
no
tyrant
has
ever
yet
succeeded
in
his
purpose
without
carrying
the
victim
with
him
it
may
be
as
it
often
is
by
force
most
people
choose
rather
to
yield
to
the
will
of
the
tyrant
than
to
suffer
for
the
consequences
of
resistance
hence
does
terrorism
form
part
of
the
of
the
tyrant
but
we
have
instances
in
history
where
terrorism
has
failed
to
impose
the
terrorist
will
upon
his
victim
india
has
the
choice
before
her
now
if
then
the
acts
of
the
punjab
government
be
an
insufferable
wrong
if
the
report
of
lord
committee
and
the
two
despatches
be
a
greater
wrong
by
reason
of
their
grievous
condonation
of
those
acts
it
is
clear
that
we
must
refuse
to
submit
to
this
official
violence
appeal
the
parliament
by
all
means
if
necessary
but
if
the
parliament
fails
us
and
if
we
are
worthy
to
call
ourselves
a
nation
we
must
refuse
to
uphold
the
government
by
withdrawing
from
it
the
duty
of
the
punjabee
the
allahabad
deserves
to
be
congratulated
for
publishing
the
correspondence
on
bosworth
smith
who
was
one
of
the
martial
law
officers
against
whom
the
complaints
about
persistent
and
continuous
were
among
the
bitterest
it
appears
from
the
correspondence
that
bosworth
smith
has
received
promotion
instead
of
dismissal
sometime
before
martial
law
smith
appears
to
have
been
degraded
he
has
since
been
restored
says
the
correspondent
to
his
position
of
a
deputy
commissioner
of
the
second
grade
from
which
he
was
degraded
and
also
been
invested
with
power
under
section
of
the
criminal
procedure
code
since
his
arrival
the
poor
indian
population
of
the
town
of
amhala
cantonment
has
been
living
under
a
regime
of
horror
and
tyranny
the
correspondent
adds
i
use
both
these
words
deliberately
for
conveying
precisely
what
they
mean
i
cull
a
few
passage
from
this
illuminating
letter
to
illustrate
the
meaning
of
horror
and
tyranny
in
private
complaints
he
never
takes
the
statement
of
the
complainant
it
is
taken
down
by
the
reader
when
the
court
rises
and
got
signed
by
the
magistrate
the
following
day
whether
the
report
received
upon
such
complaints
is
favourable
to
the
complainant
or
unfavourable
to
him
it
is
never
ready
by
the
magistrate
and
complaints
are
dismissed
without
proper
trial
this
is
the
fate
of
private
complaints
now
as
regards
police
chellans
pleaders
for
the
accused
are
not
allowed
to
interview
under
trial
prisoners
in
police
custody
they
are
not
allowed
to
prosecution
witnesses
prosecution
witnesses
are
examined
with
leading
questions
thus
a
whole
prosecution
story
is
put
into
the
mouth
of
police
witnesses
for
the
defence
though
called
in
are
not
allowed
to
be
examined
by
the
defence
counsel
the
accused
is
silenced
if
he
picks
up
courage
to
say
anything
in
defence
any
cantonment
servant
can
write
down
the
name
of
any
citizen
of
the
cantonment
on
a
chit
of
paper
and
ask
him
to
appear
the
next
day
in
court
this
is
a
summons
if
any
one
does
not
appear
in
court
who
is
thus
ordered
criminal
warrants
of
arrest
are
issued
against
him
there
is
much
more
of
this
style
in
the
letter
which
is
worth
producing
but
i
have
given
enough
to
illustrate
the
writer
meaning
let
me
turn
for
a
while
to
this
official
record
during
martial
law
he
is
the
official
who
tried
people
in
batches
and
convicted
them
after
a
farcical
trial
witnesses
have
deposed
to
his
having
assembled
people
having
asked
them
to
give
false
evidence
having
removed
women
veils
called
them
bitches
and
having
spat
upon
them
he
it
was
who
subjected
the
innocent
pleaders
of
shokhupura
indescribable
persecution
andrews
personally
investigated
complaints
against
this
official
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
no
official
had
behaved
worse
than
smith
he
gathered
the
people
of
shokhupura
humiliated
them
in
a
variety
of
ways
called
them
mukkhi
his
evidence
before
the
hunter
commission
betrays
his
total
disregard
for
truth
and
this
is
the
officer
who
if
the
correspondent
in
question
has
given
correct
facts
has
been
promoted
the
question
however
is
why
he
is
at
all
in
government
service
and
why
he
has
not
been
tried
for
assaulting
and
abusing
innocent
men
and
women
i
notice
a
desire
for
the
impeachment
of
general
dyer
and
sir
michael
i
will
not
stop
to
examine
whether
the
course
is
feasible
i
was
sorry
to
find
shastriar
joining
this
cry
for
the
prosecution
of
general
dyer
if
the
english
people
will
willingly
do
so
i
would
welcome
such
prosecution
as
a
sign
of
their
strong
disapproval
of
the
jallianwalla
bagh
atrocity
but
i
would
certainly
not
spend
a
single
farthing
in
a
vain
pursuit
after
the
conviction
of
this
man
surely
the
public
has
received
sufficient
experience
of
the
english
mind
practically
the
whole
english
press
has
joined
the
conspiracy
to
screen
these
offenders
against
humanity
i
would
not
be
party
to
make
heroes
of
them
by
joining
the
cry
for
prosecution
private
or
public
if
i
can
only
persuade
india
to
insist
upon
their
complete
dismissal
i
should
be
satisfied
but
more
than
the
dismissal
of
sir
michael
and
general
dyer
is
necessary
the
peremptory
dismissal
if
not
a
trial
of
colonel
bosworth
smith
rai
shri
ram
and
others
mentioned
in
the
congress
report
bad
as
general
dyer
is
i
consider
smith
to
be
infinitely
worse
and
his
crimes
to
be
far
more
serious
than
the
massacre
of
jallianwalla
bugh
general
dyer
sincerely
believed
that
it
was
a
soldierly
act
to
terrorise
people
by
shooting
them
but
smith
was
wantonly
cruel
vulgar
and
debased
if
all
the
facts
that
have
been
deposed
to
against
him
are
true
there
is
not
a
spark
of
humanity
about
him
unlike
general
dyer
he
lacks
the
courage
to
confirm
what
he
has
done
and
he
wriggles
when
challenged
this
officer
remains
free
to
inflict
himself
upon
people
who
have
done
no
wrong
to
him
and
who
is
permitted
to
disgrace
the
rule
he
represents
for
the
time
being
what
is
the
punjab
doing
is
it
not
the
duty
of
the
punjabis
not
to
rest
until
they
have
secured
the
dismissal
of
smith
and
the
like
the
punjab
leaders
have
been
discharged
in
vain
if
they
will
not
utilise
the
liberty
they
have
received
in
order
to
purge
the
administration
of
bosworth
smith
and
company
i
am
sure
that
if
they
will
only
begin
a
determined
agitation
they
will
have
the
whole
india
by
their
side
i
venture
to
suggest
to
them
that
the
best
way
to
qualify
for
sending
general
dyer
to
the
gallows
is
to
perform
the
easier
and
the
more
urgent
duty
of
arresting
the
mischief
still
continued
by
the
officials
against
whom
they
have
assisted
in
collecting
overwhelming
evidence
general
dyer
the
army
council
has
found
general
dyer
guilty
of
error
of
judgment
and
advised
that
he
should
not
receive
any
office
under
the
crown
montagu
has
been
unsparing
in
his
criticism
of
general
dyer
conduct
and
yet
somehow
or
other
i
can
not
help
feeling
that
general
dyer
is
by
no
means
the
worst
offender
his
brutality
is
unmistakable
his
abject
and
cowardice
is
apparent
in
every
line
of
his
amazing
defence
before
the
army
council
he
has
called
an
unarmed
crowd
of
men
and
children
mostly
rebel
army
he
believes
himself
to
be
the
saviour
of
the
punjab
in
that
he
was
able
to
shoot
down
like
rabbits
men
who
were
penned
in
an
inclosure
such
a
man
is
unworthy
of
being
considered
a
soldier
there
was
no
bravery
in
his
action
he
ran
no
risk
he
shot
without
the
slightest
opposition
and
without
warning
this
is
not
an
of
judgement
it
is
paralysis
of
it
in
the
face
of
fancied
danger
it
is
proof
of
criminal
incapacity
and
heartlessness
but
the
fury
that
has
been
spent
upon
general
dyer
is
i
am
sure
largely
misdirected
no
doubt
the
shooting
was
the
loss
of
innocent
life
deplorable
but
the
slow
torture
degradation
and
emasculation
that
followed
was
much
worse
more
calculated
malicious
and
and
the
actors
who
performed
the
deeds
deserve
greater
condemnation
that
general
dyer
for
the
jallianwalla
bagh
massacre
the
latter
merely
destroyed
a
few
bodies
but
the
others
tried
to
kill
the
soul
of
a
nation
who
ever
talks
of
frank
johnson
who
was
by
far
the
worst
offender
he
terrorised
guiltless
lahore
and
by
his
merciless
orders
set
the
tone
to
the
whole
of
the
martial
law
officers
but
what
i
am
concerned
with
is
not
even
johnson
the
first
business
of
the
people
of
the
punjab
and
of
india
is
to
rid
the
service
of
col
bosworth
smith
rai
shri
ram
and
malik
khan
they
are
still
retained
in
the
service
their
guilt
is
as
much
proved
as
that
of
general
dyer
we
shall
have
failed
in
our
duty
if
the
condemnation
pronounced
upon
general
dyer
produces
a
sense
of
satisfaction
and
the
obvious
duty
of
purging
the
administration
in
the
punjab
is
neglected
that
task
will
not
be
performed
by
platform
rhetoric
or
resolutions
merely
stern
action
is
required
on
out
part
if
we
are
to
make
any
headway
with
ourselves
and
make
any
impression
upon
the
officials
that
they
are
not
to
consider
themselves
as
masters
of
the
people
but
as
their
trusties
and
servants
who
can
not
hold
office
if
they
misbehave
themselves
and
prove
unworthy
of
the
trust
reposed
in
them
the
punjab
sentences
the
commissioners
appointed
by
the
congress
punjab
sub
committee
have
in
their
report
accused
his
excellency
the
viceroy
of
criminal
want
of
imagination
his
excellency
refusal
to
commute
two
death
sentences
out
of
five
is
a
fine
illustration
of
the
accusation
the
rejection
of
the
appeal
by
the
privy
council
no
more
proves
the
guilt
of
the
condemned
than
their
innocence
would
have
been
proved
by
quashing
the
proceedings
before
the
martial
law
tribunal
moreover
these
cases
clearly
come
under
the
royal
proclamation
in
accordance
with
its
interpretation
by
the
punjab
government
the
murders
in
amritsar
were
not
due
to
any
private
quarrel
between
the
murderers
and
their
victims
the
offence
grave
though
it
was
was
purely
political
and
committed
under
excitement
more
than
full
reparation
has
been
taken
for
the
murders
and
arson
in
the
circumstances
commonsense
dictates
reduction
of
the
death
sentences
the
popular
belief
favours
the
view
that
the
condemned
men
are
innocent
and
have
not
had
a
fair
trial
the
execution
has
been
so
long
delayed
that
hanging
at
this
stage
would
give
a
rude
shock
to
indian
society
any
viceroy
with
imagination
would
have
at
once
announced
commutation
of
the
death
sentences
not
so
lord
chelmsford
in
his
estimation
evidently
the
demands
of
justice
will
not
be
satisfied
if
at
least
some
of
the
condemned
men
are
not
hanged
public
feeling
with
him
counts
for
nothing
we
shall
still
hope
that
either
the
viceroy
or
montagu
will
commute
the
death
sentences
but
if
the
government
will
grievously
err
if
they
carry
out
the
sentences
the
people
will
equally
err
if
they
give
way
to
anger
or
grief
over
the
hanging
if
it
has
unfortunately
to
take
plane
before
we
become
a
nation
possessing
an
effective
voice
in
the
councils
of
nations
we
must
be
prepared
to
contemplate
with
equanimity
not
a
thousand
murders
of
innocent
men
and
women
but
many
thousands
before
we
attain
a
status
in
the
world
that
shall
not
be
surpassed
by
any
nation
we
hope
therefore
that
all
concerned
will
take
rather
than
lose
heart
and
treat
hanging
as
an
ordinary
affair
of
life
since
the
above
was
in
type
we
have
received
cruel
news
at
last
the
viceroy
has
mercilessly
given
the
rude
shock
to
indian
society
it
is
now
for
the
latter
to
take
heart
in
spite
of
the
unkindest
ed
iv
swaraj
swaraj
in
one
year
much
laughter
has
been
indulged
in
at
my
expense
for
having
told
the
congress
audience
at
calcutta
that
if
there
was
sufficient
response
to
my
programme
of
swaraj
would
be
attained
in
one
year
some
have
ignored
my
condition
and
laughed
because
of
the
impossibility
of
getting
swaraj
anyhow
within
one
year
others
have
spelt
the
in
capitals
and
suggested
that
if
were
permissible
in
argument
any
absurdity
could
be
proved
to
be
a
possibility
my
proposition
however
is
based
on
a
mathematical
calculation
and
i
venture
to
say
that
true
swaraj
is
a
practical
impossibility
without
due
fulfilment
of
my
conditions
swaraj
means
a
state
such
that
we
can
maintain
our
separate
existence
without
the
presence
of
the
english
if
it
is
to
be
a
partnership
it
must
be
partnership
at
will
there
can
be
no
swaraj
without
our
feeling
and
being
the
equals
of
englishmen
we
feel
that
we
are
dependent
upon
them
for
our
internal
and
external
security
for
an
armed
peace
between
the
hindus
and
the
mussulmans
for
our
education
and
for
the
supply
of
daily
wants
nay
even
for
the
settlement
of
our
religious
squabbles
the
rajahs
are
dependent
upon
the
british
for
their
powers
and
the
millionaires
for
their
millions
the
british
know
our
helplessness
and
sir
thomas
holland
cracks
jokes
quite
legitimately
at
the
expense
of
to
get
swaraj
then
is
to
get
rid
of
our
helplessness
the
problem
is
no
doubt
stupendous
even
as
it
is
for
the
fabled
lion
who
having
been
brought
up
in
the
company
of
goats
found
it
impossible
to
feel
that
he
was
a
lion
as
tolstoy
used
to
put
it
mankind
often
laboured
under
hypnotism
under
its
spell
continuously
we
feel
the
feeling
of
helplessness
the
british
themselves
can
not
be
expected
to
help
us
out
of
it
on
the
contrary
they
din
into
our
ears
that
we
shall
be
fit
to
govern
ourselves
only
by
slow
educative
processes
the
times
suggested
that
if
we
boycott
the
councils
we
shall
lose
the
opportunity
of
a
training
in
swaraj
i
have
no
doubt
that
there
are
many
who
believe
what
the
times
says
it
even
resorts
to
a
falsehood
it
audaciously
says
that
lord
milner
mission
listened
to
the
egyptians
only
when
they
were
ready
to
lift
the
boycott
of
the
egyptian
council
for
me
the
only
training
in
swaraj
we
need
is
the
ability
to
defend
ourselves
against
the
whole
world
and
to
live
our
natural
life
in
perfect
freedom
even
though
it
may
be
full
of
defects
good
government
is
no
substitute
for
the
afghans
have
a
bad
government
but
it
is
i
envy
them
the
japanese
learnt
the
art
through
a
sea
of
blood
and
if
we
had
the
power
to
drive
out
the
english
by
superior
brute
force
we
would
be
counted
their
superiors
and
in
spite
of
our
inexperience
in
debating
at
the
council
table
or
in
holding
executive
offices
we
would
be
held
fit
to
govern
ourselves
for
brute
force
is
the
only
test
the
west
has
hitherto
recognised
the
germans
were
defeated
not
because
they
were
necessarily
in
the
wrong
but
because
the
allied
powers
were
found
to
possess
greater
brute
strength
in
the
end
therefore
india
must
either
learn
the
art
of
war
which
the
british
will
not
teach
her
or
she
must
follow
her
own
way
of
discipline
and
through
it
is
as
amazing
as
it
is
humiliating
that
less
than
one
white
men
should
be
able
to
rule
three
hundred
and
fifteen
million
indians
they
do
so
somewhat
undoubtedly
by
force
but
more
by
securing
our
in
a
thousand
ways
and
making
us
more
and
more
helpless
and
dependent
on
them
as
time
goes
forward
let
us
not
mistake
reformed
councils
more
lawcourts
and
even
governorships
for
real
freedom
or
power
they
are
but
subtler
methods
of
emasculation
the
british
can
not
rule
us
by
mere
force
and
so
they
resort
to
all
means
honourable
and
dishonourable
in
order
to
retain
their
hold
on
india
they
want
billions
and
they
want
india
man
power
for
their
imperialistic
greed
if
we
refuse
to
supply
them
with
men
and
money
we
achieve
our
goal
namely
swaraj
equality
manliness
the
cup
of
our
humiliation
was
filled
during
the
closing
scenes
in
the
viceregal
council
shustri
could
not
move
his
resolution
on
the
punjab
the
indian
victims
of
jullianwala
received
rs
the
english
victims
of
received
lakhs
the
officials
who
were
guilty
of
crimes
against
those
whose
servants
they
were
were
reprimanded
and
the
councillors
were
satisfied
if
india
were
powerful
india
would
not
have
stood
this
addition
of
insult
to
her
injury
i
do
not
blame
the
british
if
we
were
weak
in
numbers
as
they
are
we
too
would
perhaps
have
resorted
to
the
same
methods
as
they
are
now
employing
terrorism
and
deception
are
weapons
not
of
the
strong
but
of
the
weak
the
british
are
weak
in
numbers
we
are
weak
in
spite
of
our
numbers
the
result
is
that
each
is
dragging
the
other
down
it
is
common
experience
that
englishmen
lose
in
character
after
residence
in
india
and
that
indians
lose
in
courage
and
manliness
by
contact
with
englishmen
this
process
of
weakening
is
good
neither
for
us
two
nations
nor
for
the
world
but
if
we
indians
take
care
of
ourselves
the
english
and
the
rest
of
the
world
would
take
care
of
themselves
our
contributions
to
the
world
progress
must
therefore
consist
in
setting
our
own
house
in
order
training
in
arms
for
the
present
is
out
of
the
question
i
go
a
step
further
and
believe
that
india
has
a
better
mission
for
the
world
it
is
within
her
to
show
that
she
can
achieve
her
destiny
by
pure
this
can
be
done
only
by
and
is
possible
only
when
those
who
commenced
to
being
the
process
of
withdrawal
if
we
can
but
free
ourselves
from
the
threefold
of
schools
government
and
legislative
councils
and
truly
control
our
own
education
regulate
our
disputes
and
be
indifferent
to
their
legislation
we
are
ready
to
govern
ourselves
and
we
are
only
then
ready
to
ask
the
government
servants
whether
civil
or
military
to
resign
and
the
to
suspend
payment
of
taxes
and
is
it
such
an
impracticable
proposition
to
expect
parents
to
withdraw
their
children
from
schools
and
colleges
and
establish
their
own
institutions
or
to
ask
lawyers
to
suspend
their
practice
and
devote
their
whole
time
attention
to
national
service
against
payment
where
necessary
of
their
maintenance
or
to
ask
candidates
for
councils
not
to
enter
councils
and
lend
their
passive
or
active
assistance
to
the
legislative
machinery
through
which
all
control
is
exercised
the
movement
of
is
nothing
but
an
attempt
to
isolate
the
brute
force
of
the
british
from
all
the
trappings
under
which
it
is
hidden
and
to
show
that
brute
force
by
itself
can
not
for
one
single
moment
hold
india
but
i
frankly
confess
that
until
the
three
conditions
mentioned
by
me
are
fulfilled
there
is
no
swaraj
we
may
not
go
on
taking
our
college
degrees
taking
thousands
of
rupees
monthly
from
clients
for
cases
which
can
be
finished
in
five
minutes
and
taking
the
keenest
delight
in
wasting
national
time
on
the
council
floor
and
still
expect
to
gain
national
the
last
though
not
the
least
important
part
of
the
maya
still
remains
to
be
considered
that
is
swadeshi
had
we
not
abandoned
swadeshi
we
need
not
have
been
in
the
present
fallen
state
if
we
would
get
rid
of
the
economic
slavery
we
must
manufacture
our
own
cloth
and
at
the
present
moment
only
by
and
hand
weaving
all
this
means
discipline
organising
ability
confidence
and
courage
if
we
show
this
in
one
year
among
the
classes
that
count
and
make
public
opinion
we
certainly
gain
swaraj
within
one
year
if
i
am
told
that
even
we
who
lead
have
not
these
qualities
in
us
there
certainly
will
never
be
swaraj
for
india
but
then
we
shall
have
no
right
to
blame
the
english
for
what
they
are
doing
our
salvation
and
its
time
are
solely
dependent
upon
us
british
rule
an
evil
the
is
however
more
to
the
point
in
asking
does
gandhi
hold
without
hesitation
or
reserve
that
british
rule
in
india
is
altogether
an
evil
and
that
the
people
of
india
are
to
be
taught
so
to
regard
it
he
must
hold
it
to
be
so
evil
that
the
wrongs
it
does
outweigh
the
benefit
it
confers
for
only
so
is
to
be
justified
at
the
bar
of
conscience
or
of
christ
my
answer
is
emphatically
in
the
affirmative
so
long
as
i
believed
that
the
sum
total
of
the
energy
of
the
british
empire
was
good
i
clung
to
it
despite
what
i
used
to
regard
as
temporary
aberrations
i
am
not
sorry
for
having
done
so
but
having
my
eyes
opened
it
would
be
sin
for
me
to
associate
myself
with
the
empire
unless
it
purges
itself
of
its
evil
character
i
write
this
with
sorrow
and
i
should
be
pleased
if
i
discovered
that
i
was
in
error
and
that
my
present
attitude
was
a
reaction
the
continuous
financial
drain
the
emasculation
of
the
punjab
and
the
betrayal
of
the
muslim
sentiment
constitute
in
my
humble
opinion
a
threefold
robbery
of
india
blessings
of
i
reckon
therefore
to
be
a
curse
we
would
have
at
least
remained
like
the
other
nations
brave
men
and
women
instead
of
feeling
as
we
do
so
utterly
helpless
if
we
had
no
british
rule
imposing
on
us
an
armed
peace
blessing
of
roads
and
railways
is
a
return
no
nation
would
accept
for
its
degradation
of
education
is
proving
one
of
the
greatest
obstacles
in
our
progress
towards
freedom
a
movement
of
purification
the
fact
is
that
by
reason
of
its
has
become
a
religious
and
purifying
movement
it
is
daily
bringing
strength
to
the
nation
showing
it
its
weak
spots
and
the
remedy
for
removing
them
it
is
a
movement
of
it
is
the
mightiest
force
for
revolutionising
opinion
and
stimulating
thought
it
is
a
movement
of
suffering
and
therefore
possesses
automatic
checks
against
extravagance
or
impatience
the
capacity
of
the
nation
for
suffering
regulates
its
advance
towards
freedom
it
isolates
the
force
of
evil
by
refraining
from
participation
in
it
in
any
shape
or
form
why
was
india
lost
a
dialog
between
the
reader
and
editor
home
reader
you
have
said
much
about
civilisation
enough
to
make
me
ponder
over
it
i
do
not
know
what
i
should
adopt
and
what
i
should
avoid
from
the
nations
of
europe
but
one
question
comes
to
my
lips
immediately
if
civilisation
is
a
disease
and
if
it
has
attacked
england
why
has
she
been
able
to
take
india
and
why
is
she
able
to
retain
it
editor
your
question
is
not
very
difficult
to
answer
and
we
shall
presently
be
able
to
examine
the
true
nature
of
swaraj
for
i
am
aware
that
i
have
still
to
answer
that
question
i
will
however
take
up
your
previous
question
the
english
have
not
taken
india
we
have
given
it
to
them
they
are
not
in
india
because
of
their
strength
but
because
we
keep
them
let
us
now
see
whether
these
positions
can
be
sustained
they
came
to
our
country
originally
for
the
purpose
of
trade
recall
the
company
bahadur
who
made
it
bahadur
they
had
not
the
slightest
intention
at
the
time
of
establishing
a
kingdom
who
assisted
the
company
officers
who
was
tempted
at
the
sight
of
their
silver
who
bought
their
goods
history
testifies
that
we
did
all
this
in
order
to
become
rich
all
at
once
we
welcomed
the
company
officers
with
open
arms
we
assisted
them
if
i
am
in
the
habit
of
drinking
bhang
and
a
seller
thereof
sells
it
to
me
am
i
to
blame
him
or
myself
by
blaming
the
seller
shall
i
be
able
to
avoid
the
habit
and
if
a
particular
retailer
is
driven
away
will
not
another
take
his
place
a
true
servant
of
india
will
have
to
go
to
the
root
of
the
matter
if
an
excess
of
food
has
caused
me
indigestion
i
will
certainly
not
avoid
it
by
blaming
water
he
is
a
true
physician
who
probes
the
cause
of
disease
and
if
you
pose
as
a
physician
for
the
disease
of
india
you
will
have
to
find
out
its
true
cause
reader
you
are
right
now
i
think
you
will
not
have
to
argue
much
with
me
to
drive
your
conclusions
home
i
am
impatient
to
know
your
further
views
we
are
now
on
a
most
interesting
topic
i
shall
therefore
endeavour
to
follow
your
thought
and
stop
you
when
i
am
in
doubt
editor
i
am
afraid
that
in
spite
of
your
enthusiasm
as
we
proceed
further
we
shall
have
differences
of
opinion
nevertheless
i
shall
argue
only
when
you
will
stop
me
we
have
already
seen
that
the
english
merchants
were
able
to
get
a
footing
in
india
because
we
encouraged
them
when
our
princes
fought
among
themselves
they
sought
the
assistance
of
company
bahadar
that
corporation
was
versed
alike
in
commerce
and
war
it
was
unhampered
by
questions
of
morality
its
object
was
to
increase
its
commerce
and
to
make
money
it
accepted
our
assistance
and
increased
the
number
of
its
warehouses
to
protect
the
latter
it
employed
an
army
which
was
utilised
by
us
also
is
it
not
then
useless
to
blame
the
english
for
what
we
did
at
that
time
the
hindus
and
the
mahomedans
were
at
daggers
drawn
this
too
gave
the
company
its
opportunity
and
thus
we
created
the
circumstances
that
gave
the
company
its
control
over
india
hence
it
is
truer
to
say
that
we
gave
india
to
the
english
than
that
india
was
lost
reader
will
you
now
tell
me
how
they
are
able
to
retain
india
editor
the
causes
that
gave
them
india
enable
them
to
retain
it
some
englishmen
state
that
they
took
and
they
hold
india
by
the
sword
both
these
statements
are
wrong
the
sword
is
entirely
useless
for
holding
india
we
alone
keep
them
napoleon
is
said
to
have
described
the
english
as
a
nation
of
shop
keepers
it
is
a
fitting
description
they
hold
whatever
dominions
they
have
for
the
sake
of
their
commerce
their
army
and
their
navy
are
intended
to
protect
it
when
the
transvaal
offered
no
such
attractions
the
late
gladstone
discovered
that
it
was
no
right
for
the
english
to
hold
it
when
it
became
a
paying
proposition
resistance
led
to
war
chamberlain
soon
discovered
that
england
enjoyed
a
suzerainty
over
the
transvaal
it
is
related
that
some
one
asked
the
late
president
kruger
whether
there
was
gold
in
the
moon
he
replied
that
it
was
highly
unlikely
because
if
there
were
the
english
would
have
annexed
it
many
problems
can
be
solved
by
remembering
that
money
is
their
god
then
it
follows
that
we
keep
the
english
in
india
for
our
base
we
like
their
commerce
they
please
us
by
their
subtle
methods
and
get
what
they
want
from
us
to
blame
them
for
this
is
to
perpetuate
their
power
we
further
strengthen
their
hold
by
quarrelling
amongst
ourselves
if
you
accept
the
above
statements
it
is
proved
that
the
english
entered
india
for
the
purposes
of
trade
they
remain
in
it
for
the
same
purpose
and
we
help
them
to
do
so
their
arms
and
ammunition
are
perfectly
useless
in
this
connection
i
remind
you
that
it
is
the
british
flag
which
is
waving
in
japan
and
not
the
japanese
the
english
have
a
treaty
with
japan
for
the
sake
of
their
commerce
and
you
will
see
that
if
they
can
manage
it
their
commerce
will
greatly
expand
in
that
country
they
wish
to
convert
the
whole
word
into
a
vast
market
for
their
goods
that
they
can
not
do
so
is
true
but
the
blame
will
not
be
theirs
they
will
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
reach
the
goal
swaraj
my
ideal
the
following
is
a
fairly
full
report
of
gandhi
important
speech
at
calcutta
on
the
december
the
very
fact
that
so
many
of
you
can
not
understand
hindi
which
is
bound
to
be
the
national
medium
of
expression
throughout
hindustan
in
gatherings
of
indians
belonging
to
different
parts
of
the
land
shows
the
depth
of
the
degradation
to
which
we
have
sunk
and
points
to
the
supreme
necessity
of
the
movement
which
is
intended
to
lift
us
out
of
that
condition
this
government
has
been
instrumental
in
degrading
this
great
nation
in
various
ways
and
it
is
impossible
to
be
free
from
it
without
amongst
ourselves
which
is
in
turn
impossible
without
a
national
medium
of
expression
but
i
am
not
here
to
day
to
plead
for
the
medium
i
am
to
plead
for
the
acceptance
by
the
country
of
the
programme
of
progressive
now
all
the
words
that
i
have
used
here
are
absolutely
necessary
and
the
two
adjectives
and
are
integral
part
of
a
whole
with
me
is
part
of
my
religion
a
matter
of
creed
but
with
the
great
number
of
mussalmans
is
a
policy
with
thousand
if
not
millions
of
hindus
it
is
equally
a
matter
of
policy
but
whether
it
is
a
creed
or
a
policy
it
is
utterly
impossible
for
you
to
finish
the
programme
for
the
enfranchisement
of
the
millions
of
india
without
recognising
the
necessity
and
the
value
of
violence
may
for
a
moment
avail
to
secure
a
certain
measure
of
success
but
it
could
not
in
the
long
run
achieve
any
appreciable
result
on
the
other
hand
all
violence
would
prove
destructive
to
the
honour
and
of
the
nation
the
blue
books
issued
by
the
government
of
india
show
that
inasmuch
as
we
have
used
violence
military
expenditure
has
gone
up
not
proportionately
but
in
geometrical
progression
the
bonds
of
our
slavery
have
been
forged
all
the
stronger
for
our
having
offered
violence
and
the
whole
history
of
british
rule
in
india
is
a
demonstration
of
the
fact
that
we
have
never
been
able
to
offer
successful
violence
whilst
therefore
i
say
that
rather
than
have
the
yoke
of
a
government
that
has
so
emasculated
us
i
would
welcome
violence
i
would
urge
with
all
the
emphasis
that
i
can
command
that
india
will
never
be
able
to
regain
her
own
by
methods
of
violence
lord
ronaldshay
who
has
done
me
the
honour
of
reading
my
booklet
on
home
rule
has
warned
my
countrymen
against
engaging
themselves
in
a
struggle
for
a
swaraj
such
as
is
described
in
that
booklet
now
though
i
do
not
want
to
withdraw
a
single
word
of
it
i
would
say
to
you
on
this
occasion
that
i
do
not
ask
india
to
follow
out
the
methods
prescribed
in
my
booklet
if
they
could
do
that
they
would
have
home
rule
not
in
a
year
but
in
a
day
and
india
by
realising
that
ideal
wants
to
acquire
an
ascendancy
over
the
rest
of
the
world
but
it
must
remain
a
day
dream
more
or
less
for
the
time
being
what
i
am
doing
is
that
i
am
giving
the
country
a
pardonable
programme
not
the
abolition
of
law
courts
posts
telegraphs
and
of
railways
but
for
the
attainment
of
parliamentary
swarja
i
am
telling
you
to
do
that
so
long
as
we
do
not
isolate
ourselves
from
this
government
we
are
with
it
through
schools
law
courts
and
councils
through
service
civil
and
military
and
payment
of
taxes
and
foreign
trade
the
moment
this
fact
is
realised
and
is
effected
this
government
must
totter
to
pieces
if
i
know
that
the
masses
were
prepared
for
the
whole
programme
at
once
i
would
not
delay
in
putting
it
at
once
to
work
it
is
not
possible
at
the
present
moment
to
prevent
the
masses
from
bursting
out
into
wrath
against
those
who
come
to
execute
the
law
it
is
not
possible
that
the
military
would
lay
down
their
arms
without
the
slightest
violence
if
that
were
possible
i
would
propose
all
the
stages
of
to
be
worked
simultaneously
but
we
have
not
secured
that
control
over
the
masses
we
have
uselessly
frittered
away
precious
years
of
the
nation
life
in
mastering
a
language
which
we
need
least
for
winning
our
liberty
we
have
frittered
away
all
those
years
in
learning
liberty
from
milton
and
shakespeare
in
deriving
inspiration
from
the
pages
of
mill
whilst
liberty
could
be
learnt
at
our
doors
we
have
thus
succeeded
in
isolating
ourselves
from
the
masses
we
have
been
westernised
we
have
failed
these
years
to
utilise
our
education
in
order
to
permeate
the
masses
we
have
sat
upon
the
pedestal
and
from
there
delivered
harangues
to
them
in
a
language
they
do
not
understand
and
we
see
that
we
are
unable
to
conduct
large
gatherings
in
a
disciplined
manner
and
discipline
is
the
essence
of
success
here
is
therefore
one
reason
why
i
have
introduced
the
word
in
the
resolution
without
any
impertinence
i
may
say
that
i
understand
the
mass
mind
better
than
any
one
amongst
the
educated
indians
i
contend
that
the
masses
are
not
ready
for
suspension
of
payment
of
taxes
they
have
not
yet
learnt
sufficient
if
i
was
sure
of
on
their
part
i
would
ask
them
to
suspend
payment
and
not
waste
a
single
moment
of
the
nations
time
with
me
the
liberty
of
india
has
become
a
passion
liberty
of
islam
is
as
dear
to
me
i
would
not
therefore
delay
a
moment
if
i
found
that
the
whole
of
the
programme
could
be
enforced
at
once
it
grieves
me
to
miss
the
faces
of
dear
and
revered
leaders
in
this
assembly
we
miss
here
the
trumpet
voice
of
surendranath
banorji
who
has
rendered
inestimable
service
to
the
country
and
though
we
stand
as
poles
asunder
though
we
may
have
sharp
differences
with
him
we
must
express
them
with
becoming
restraint
i
do
not
ask
you
to
give
up
a
single
iota
of
principle
i
urge
in
language
and
in
deed
if
is
essential
in
our
dealings
with
government
it
is
more
essential
in
our
dealings
with
our
leaders
and
it
grieves
me
deeply
to
hear
of
recent
instances
of
violence
reported
to
have
been
used
in
east
bongal
against
our
own
people
i
was
pained
to
hear
that
the
ears
of
a
man
who
had
voted
at
the
recent
elections
had
been
cut
and
night
soil
had
been
thrown
into
the
bed
of
a
man
who
had
stood
as
a
candidate
is
never
going
to
succeed
in
this
way
it
will
not
succeed
unless
we
create
an
atmosphere
of
perfect
freedom
unless
we
prize
our
opponents
liberty
as
much
as
our
own
the
liberty
of
faith
conscience
thought
and
action
which
we
claim
for
ourselves
must
be
conceded
equally
to
others
non
is
a
process
of
purification
and
we
must
continually
try
to
touch
the
hearts
of
those
who
differ
from
us
their
minds
and
their
emotions
but
never
their
bodies
discipline
and
restraint
are
the
cardinal
principles
of
our
conduct
and
i
warn
you
against
any
sort
of
tyrannical
social
ostracism
i
was
deeply
grieved
therefore
to
hear
of
the
insult
offered
to
a
dead
body
in
delhi
and
feel
that
if
it
was
the
action
of
they
have
disgraced
themselves
and
their
creed
i
repeat
we
can
not
deliver
our
land
through
violence
it
was
not
a
joke
when
i
said
on
the
congress
platform
that
swaraj
could
be
established
in
one
year
if
there
was
sufficient
response
from
the
nation
three
months
of
this
year
are
gone
if
we
are
true
to
our
salt
true
to
our
nation
true
to
the
songs
we
sing
if
we
are
true
to
the
bhagwad
gita
and
the
koran
we
would
finish
the
programme
in
the
remaining
nine
months
and
deliver
islam
the
punjab
and
india
i
have
proposed
a
limited
programme
workable
within
one
year
having
a
special
regard
to
the
educated
classes
we
seem
to
be
labouring
under
the
illusion
that
we
can
not
possibly
live
without
councils
law
courts
and
schools
provided
by
the
government
the
moment
we
are
disillusioned
we
have
swaraj
it
is
demoralising
both
for
government
and
the
governed
that
a
hundred
thousand
pilgrims
should
dictate
terms
to
a
nation
composed
of
three
hundred
millions
and
how
is
it
they
can
thus
dictate
terms
it
is
because
we
have
been
divided
and
they
have
ruled
i
have
never
forgotten
humes
frank
confession
that
the
british
government
was
sustained
by
the
policy
of
divide
and
rule
therefore
it
is
that
i
have
laid
stress
upon
hindu
muslim
unity
as
one
of
the
important
essentials
for
the
success
of
but
it
should
be
no
lip
unity
nor
bunia
unity
it
should
be
a
unity
broad
based
on
a
recognition
of
the
heart
if
we
want
to
save
hinduism
i
say
for
gods
sake
do
not
seek
to
bargain
with
the
mussalmans
i
have
been
going
about
with
maulana
shaukat
ali
all
these
months
but
i
have
not
so
much
as
whispered
anything
about
the
protection
of
the
cow
my
alliance
with
the
ali
brothers
is
one
of
honour
i
feel
that
i
am
on
my
honour
the
whole
of
hinduism
is
on
its
honour
and
if
it
will
not
be
found
wanting
it
will
do
its
duty
towards
the
mussalmans
of
india
any
bargaining
would
be
degrading
to
us
light
brings
light
not
darkness
and
nobility
done
with
a
noble
purpose
will
be
twice
rewarded
it
will
be
god
alone
who
can
protect
the
cow
ask
me
not
about
the
cow
ask
me
after
islam
is
vindicated
through
india
ask
the
rajas
what
they
do
to
entertain
their
english
guests
do
they
not
provide
beef
and
champagne
for
their
guests
persuade
them
first
to
stop
cow
killing
and
then
think
of
bargaining
with
mussalmans
and
how
are
we
hindus
behaving
ourselves
towards
the
cow
and
her
progeny
do
we
treat
her
as
our
religion
requires
us
not
till
we
have
set
our
own
house
in
order
and
saved
the
cow
from
the
englishmen
have
we
the
right
to
plead
on
her
behalf
with
the
mussalmans
and
the
best
way
of
saving
the
cow
from
them
is
to
give
them
unconditional
help
in
their
hour
of
trouble
similarly
what
do
we
owe
the
punjab
the
whole
of
india
was
made
to
crawl
on
her
belly
in
as
much
as
a
single
punjabi
was
made
to
crawl
in
that
dirty
lane
in
amritsar
the
whole
womanhood
of
india
was
unveiled
in
as
much
as
the
innocent
woman
of
manianwalla
were
unveiled
by
an
insolent
office
and
indian
childhood
was
dishonoured
in
that
that
school
children
of
tender
age
were
made
to
walk
four
times
a
day
to
stated
places
within
the
martial
area
in
the
punjab
and
to
salute
the
union
jack
through
the
effect
of
which
order
two
children
seven
years
old
died
of
sunstroke
having
been
made
to
wait
in
the
noonday
sun
in
my
opinion
it
is
a
sin
to
attend
the
schools
and
colleges
conducted
under
the
aegis
of
this
government
so
long
as
it
has
not
purged
itself
of
these
crimes
by
proper
repentance
we
may
not
with
any
sense
of
plead
before
the
courts
of
the
government
when
we
remember
that
it
was
through
the
punjab
courts
that
innocent
men
were
sentenced
to
be
imprisoned
and
hanged
we
become
participators
in
the
crime
of
the
government
by
voluntarily
helping
it
or
being
helped
by
it
the
women
of
india
have
intuitively
understood
the
spiritual
nature
of
the
struggle
thousands
have
attended
to
listen
to
the
message
of
and
have
given
me
their
precious
ornaments
for
the
purpose
of
advancing
the
cause
of
swaraj
is
it
any
wonder
if
i
believe
the
possibility
of
gaining
swaraj
within
a
year
after
all
these
wonderful
demonstrations
i
would
be
guilty
of
want
of
faith
in
god
if
i
the
significance
of
the
response
from
the
women
of
india
i
hope
that
the
students
will
do
their
duty
the
country
certainly
expects
the
lawyers
who
have
hitherto
led
public
agitation
to
recognise
the
new
awakening
i
have
used
strong
language
but
i
have
done
so
with
the
greatest
deliberation
i
am
not
actuated
by
any
feeling
of
revenge
i
do
not
consider
englishmen
as
my
enemy
i
recognise
the
worth
of
many
i
enjoy
the
privilege
of
having
many
english
friends
but
i
am
a
determined
enemy
of
the
english
rule
as
is
conducted
at
present
and
if
the
power
tapasya
of
one
man
could
destroy
it
i
would
certainly
destroy
it
if
it
could
not
be
mended
an
empire
that
stands
for
injustice
and
breach
of
faith
does
not
deserve
to
stand
if
its
custodians
will
not
repent
and
has
been
devised
in
order
to
enable
the
nation
to
compel
justice
i
hope
that
bengal
will
take
her
proper
place
in
this
movement
of
bengal
began
swadeshi
and
national
education
when
the
rest
of
india
was
sleeping
i
hope
that
bengal
will
come
to
the
front
in
this
movement
for
gaining
swaraj
and
gaining
justice
for
the
khilafat
and
the
punjab
through
purification
and
on
the
wrong
track
lord
ronaldshay
has
been
doing
me
the
favour
of
reading
my
booklet
on
indian
home
rule
which
is
a
translation
of
hind
swaraj
his
lordship
told
his
audience
that
if
swaraj
meant
what
i
had
described
it
to
be
in
the
booklet
the
bengalis
would
have
none
of
it
i
am
sorry
that
swaraj
of
the
congress
resolution
does
not
mean
the
swaraj
depicted
in
the
booklet
swaraj
according
to
the
congress
means
swaraj
that
the
people
of
india
want
not
what
the
british
government
may
condescend
to
give
in
so
far
as
i
can
see
swaraj
will
be
a
parliament
chosen
by
the
people
with
the
fullest
power
over
the
finance
the
police
the
military
the
navy
the
courts
and
the
educational
institutions
i
am
free
to
confess
that
the
swaraj
i
expect
to
gain
within
one
year
if
india
responds
will
be
such
swaraj
as
will
make
practically
impossible
the
repetition
of
the
khilafat
and
the
punjab
wrongs
and
will
enable
the
nation
to
do
good
or
evil
as
it
chooses
and
not
he
at
the
dictation
of
an
irresponsible
insolent
and
godless
bureaucracy
under
that
swaraj
the
nation
will
have
the
power
to
impose
a
heavy
protective
tariff
on
such
foreign
goods
as
are
capable
of
being
manufactured
in
india
as
also
the
power
to
refuse
to
send
a
single
soldier
outside
india
for
the
purpose
of
enslaving
the
surrounding
or
remote
nationalities
the
swaraj
that
i
dream
of
will
be
a
possibility
only
when
the
nation
is
free
to
make
its
choice
both
of
good
and
evil
i
adhere
to
all
i
have
said
in
that
booklet
and
i
would
certainly
recommend
it
to
the
reader
government
over
self
is
the
truest
swaraj
it
is
synonymous
with
or
salvation
and
i
have
seen
nothing
to
alter
the
view
that
doctors
lawyers
and
railways
are
no
help
and
are
often
a
hindrance
to
the
one
thing
worth
striving
after
but
i
know
that
association
a
satanic
activity
such
as
the
government
is
engaged
in
makes
even
an
effort
for
such
freedom
a
practical
impossibility
i
can
not
tender
allegiance
to
god
and
satan
at
the
same
time
the
surest
sign
of
the
satanic
nature
of
the
present
system
is
that
even
a
nobleman
of
the
type
of
lord
ronaldshay
is
obliged
to
put
us
off
the
track
he
will
not
deal
with
the
one
thing
needful
why
is
he
silent
about
the
punjab
why
does
he
evade
the
khilafat
can
ointments
soothe
a
patient
who
is
suffering
from
corroding
consumption
does
his
lordship
not
see
that
it
is
not
the
inadequacy
of
the
reforms
that
has
set
india
aflame
but
that
it
is
the
infliction
of
the
two
wrongs
and
the
wicked
attempt
to
make
us
forget
them
does
he
not
see
that
a
complete
change
of
heart
is
required
before
reconciliation
but
it
has
become
the
fashion
nowadays
to
ascribe
hatred
to
and
i
regret
to
find
that
even
wedgewood
has
fallen
into
the
trap
i
make
bold
to
say
that
the
only
way
to
remove
hatred
is
to
give
it
disciplined
vent
no
man
can
i
can
not
perform
the
impossible
task
of
removing
hatred
so
long
as
contempt
and
despise
for
the
feelings
of
india
are
sedulously
nursed
it
is
a
mockery
to
ask
india
not
to
hate
when
in
the
same
breath
india
most
sacred
feelings
are
contemptuously
brushed
aside
india
feels
weak
and
helpless
and
so
expresses
her
helplessness
by
hating
the
tyrant
who
despises
her
and
makes
her
crawl
on
the
belly
lifts
the
veils
of
her
innocent
women
and
compels
her
tender
children
to
acknowledge
his
power
by
saluting
his
flag
four
times
a
day
the
gospel
of
addresses
itself
to
the
task
of
making
the
people
strong
and
it
is
an
attempt
to
transform
hatred
into
pity
a
strong
and
india
will
cease
to
hate
bosworth
smiths
and
frank
johnsons
for
she
will
have
the
power
to
punish
them
and
therefore
the
power
also
to
pity
and
forgive
them
she
can
neither
punish
nor
forgive
and
therefore
helplessly
nurses
hatred
if
the
mussalmans
were
strong
they
would
not
hate
the
english
but
would
fight
and
wrest
from
them
the
dearest
possessions
of
islam
i
know
that
the
ali
brothers
who
live
only
for
the
honour
and
the
prestige
of
islam
and
are
prepared
any
moment
to
die
for
it
will
make
friends
with
the
latter
englishmen
if
they
were
to
do
justice
to
the
khilafat
which
it
is
in
their
power
to
do
i
am
positively
certain
that
there
is
no
personal
element
in
this
fight
both
the
hindus
and
the
mahomedans
would
invoke
blessings
on
the
english
if
they
would
but
give
proof
positive
of
their
goodness
faithfulness
and
loyalty
to
india
then
is
a
godsend
it
will
purify
and
strengthen
india
and
a
strong
india
will
be
a
strength
to
the
world
as
an
indian
weak
and
helpless
is
a
curse
to
mankind
indian
soldiers
have
involuntarily
helped
to
destroy
turkey
and
are
now
destroying
the
flower
of
the
arabian
nation
i
can
not
recall
a
single
campaign
in
which
the
indian
soldier
has
been
employed
by
the
british
government
for
the
good
of
mankind
and
yet
oh
the
shame
of
it
indian
maharajas
are
never
tired
of
priding
themselves
on
the
loyal
help
they
have
rendered
the
english
could
degradation
sink
any
lower
the
congress
constitution
the
belated
report
of
the
congress
constitution
committee
has
now
been
published
for
general
information
and
opinion
has
been
invited
from
all
public
bodies
in
order
to
assist
the
deliberations
of
the
all
india
congress
committee
it
is
a
pity
that
small
though
the
constitution
committee
was
all
the
members
never
met
at
any
one
time
in
spite
of
efforts
to
have
a
meeting
of
them
all
it
is
perhaps
no
body
fault
that
all
the
members
could
not
meet
at
the
same
time
the
draft
report
has
passed
through
the
searching
examination
of
all
but
one
member
and
the
report
represents
the
mature
deliberations
of
four
out
of
the
five
members
it
must
be
stated
at
the
same
time
that
it
does
not
pretend
to
be
the
unanimous
opinion
of
the
members
rather
than
present
a
dissenting
minute
a
workable
scheme
has
been
brought
out
leaving
each
member
free
to
press
his
own
views
on
to
several
matters
in
which
they
are
not
quite
unanimous
the
most
important
part
of
the
constitution
however
is
the
alteration
of
the
creed
so
far
as
i
am
aware
there
is
no
fundamental
difference
of
opinion
between
the
members
in
my
opinion
the
altered
creed
represents
the
exact
feeling
of
the
country
at
the
present
moment
i
know
that
the
proposed
alteration
has
been
subjected
to
hostile
criticism
in
several
newspapers
of
note
but
the
extraordinary
situation
that
faces
the
country
is
that
popular
opinion
is
far
in
advance
of
several
newspapers
which
have
hitherto
commanded
influence
and
have
undoubtedly
moulded
public
opinion
the
fact
is
that
the
formation
of
opinion
is
by
no
means
confined
to
the
educated
classes
but
the
masses
have
taken
it
upon
themselves
not
only
to
formulate
opinion
but
to
enforce
it
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
belittle
or
ignore
this
opinion
or
to
ascribe
it
to
a
temporary
upheaval
it
would
be
equally
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
this
awakening
amongst
the
masses
is
due
either
to
the
activity
of
the
ali
brothers
or
myself
for
the
time
being
we
have
the
ear
of
the
masses
because
we
voice
their
sentiments
the
masses
are
by
no
means
so
foolish
or
unintelligent
as
we
sometimes
imagine
they
often
perceive
things
with
their
intuition
which
we
ourselves
fail
to
see
with
our
intellect
but
whilst
the
masses
know
what
they
want
they
often
do
not
know
how
to
express
their
wants
and
less
often
how
to
get
what
they
want
herein
comes
the
use
of
leadership
and
disastrous
results
can
easily
follow
a
bad
hasty
or
what
is
worse
selfish
lead
the
first
part
of
the
proposed
creed
expresses
the
present
desire
of
the
nation
and
the
second
shows
the
way
that
desire
can
be
fulfilled
in
my
humble
opinion
the
congress
creed
with
the
proposed
alteration
is
but
an
extension
of
the
original
and
so
long
as
no
break
with
the
british
connection
is
attempted
it
is
strictly
within
even
the
existing
article
that
defines
the
congress
creed
the
extension
lies
in
the
contemplated
possibility
of
a
break
with
the
british
connection
in
my
humble
opinion
if
india
is
to
make
unhampered
progress
we
must
make
it
clear
to
the
british
people
that
whilst
we
desire
to
retain
the
british
connection
if
we
can
rise
to
our
full
height
with
it
we
are
determined
to
dispense
with
and
even
to
get
rid
of
that
connection
if
that
is
necessary
for
full
national
development
i
hold
that
it
is
not
only
derogatory
to
national
dignity
but
it
actually
impedes
national
progress
superstitiously
to
believe
that
our
progress
towards
our
goal
is
impossible
without
british
connection
it
is
this
superstition
which
makes
some
of
the
best
of
us
tolerate
the
punjab
wrong
and
the
khilafat
insult
this
blind
adherence
to
that
connection
makes
us
feel
helpless
the
proposed
alteration
in
the
creed
enables
us
to
rid
ourselves
of
our
helpless
condition
i
personally
hold
that
it
is
perfectly
constitutional
openly
to
strive
after
independence
but
lest
there
may
be
dispute
as
to
the
constitutional
character
of
any
movement
for
complete
independence
the
doubtful
and
highly
technical
adjective
constitutional
has
been
removed
from
the
altered
creed
in
the
draft
surely
it
should
be
enough
to
ensure
that
the
methods
for
achieving
our
end
are
legitimate
honourable
and
peaceful
i
believe
that
this
was
the
reasoning
that
guided
my
colleagues
in
accepting
the
proposed
creed
in
any
case
such
was
certainly
my
view
of
the
whole
alteration
there
is
no
desire
on
my
part
to
adopt
any
means
that
are
subversive
of
law
and
order
i
know
however
that
i
am
treading
on
delicate
ground
when
i
write
about
law
and
order
for
to
some
of
our
distinguished
leaders
even
my
present
methods
appear
to
be
lawless
and
conducive
to
disorder
but
even
they
will
perhaps
grant
that
the
retention
of
the
word
can
not
protect
the
country
against
methods
such
as
i
am
employing
it
gives
rise
no
doubt
to
a
luminous
legal
discussion
but
any
such
discussion
is
fruitless
when
the
nation
means
business
the
other
important
alteration
refers
to
the
limitation
of
the
number
of
delegates
i
believe
that
the
advantages
of
such
a
limitation
are
obvious
we
are
fast
reaching
a
time
when
without
any
such
limitation
the
congress
will
become
an
unwieldy
body
it
is
difficult
even
to
have
an
unlimited
number
of
visitors
it
is
impossible
to
transact
national
business
if
we
have
an
unlimited
number
of
delegates
the
next
important
alteration
is
about
the
election
of
the
members
of
the
congress
committee
making
that
committee
practically
the
subjects
committee
and
the
redistribution
of
india
for
the
purposes
of
the
congress
on
a
linguistic
basis
it
is
not
necessary
to
comment
on
these
alterations
but
i
wish
to
add
that
if
the
congress
accepts
the
principle
of
limiting
the
number
of
delegates
it
would
be
advisable
to
introduce
the
principle
of
proportional
representation
that
would
enable
all
parties
who
wish
to
be
represented
at
the
congress
i
observe
that
servant
of
sees
an
inconsistency
between
my
implied
acceptance
of
the
british
committee
so
far
as
the
published
draft
constitution
is
concerned
and
my
recent
article
in
on
that
committee
and
the
newspaper
but
it
is
well
known
that
for
several
years
i
have
held
my
present
views
about
the
existence
of
that
body
it
would
have
been
irrelevant
for
me
perhaps
to
suggest
to
my
colleagues
the
extinction
of
that
committee
it
was
not
our
function
to
report
on
the
usefulness
or
otherwise
of
the
committee
we
were
commissioned
only
for
preparing
a
new
constitution
moreover
i
knew
that
my
colleagues
were
not
averse
to
the
existence
of
the
british
committee
and
the
drawing
up
of
a
new
constitution
enabled
me
to
show
that
where
there
was
no
question
of
principle
i
was
desirous
of
agreeing
quickly
with
my
opponents
in
opinions
but
i
propose
certainly
to
press
for
abolition
of
the
committee
as
it
is
at
present
continued
and
the
stopping
of
its
organ
swaraj
in
nine
months
asked
by
the
representative
as
to
his
impressions
formed
as
a
result
of
his
activities
during
the
last
three
months
gandhi
said
my
own
impression
of
these
three
months
extensive
experience
is
that
this
movement
of
has
come
to
stay
and
it
is
most
decidedly
a
purifying
movement
in
spite
of
isolated
instances
of
rowdyism
as
for
instance
at
besant
meeting
in
bombay
at
some
places
in
delhi
bengal
and
even
in
gujarat
the
people
are
assimilating
day
after
day
the
spirit
of
not
necessarily
as
a
creed
but
as
an
inevitable
policy
i
expect
most
startling
results
more
startling
than
say
the
discoveries
of
sir
bose
or
the
acceptance
by
the
people
of
if
the
government
could
be
assured
beyond
any
possibility
of
doubt
that
no
violence
would
ever
be
offered
by
us
the
government
would
from
that
moment
alter
its
character
unconsciously
and
involuntarily
but
nonetheless
surely
on
that
account
alter
its
character
in
what
direction
asked
the
representative
certainly
in
the
direction
which
we
ask
it
should
move
that
being
in
the
direction
of
government
becoming
responsive
to
every
call
of
the
nation
will
you
kindly
explain
further
asked
the
representative
by
that
i
mean
said
gandhi
people
will
be
able
by
asserting
themselves
through
fixed
determination
and
to
gain
the
redress
of
the
khilafat
wrong
the
punjab
wrong
and
attain
the
swaraj
of
their
choice
but
what
is
your
swaraj
and
where
does
the
government
come
in
there
the
government
which
you
say
will
alter
its
character
unconsciously
my
swaraj
said
gandhi
is
the
parliamentary
government
of
india
in
the
modern
sense
of
the
term
for
the
time
being
and
that
government
would
be
secured
to
us
either
through
the
friendly
offices
of
the
british
people
or
without
them
what
do
you
mean
by
the
phrase
them
questioned
the
interviewer
this
movement
continued
gandhi
is
an
endeavour
to
purge
the
present
government
of
selfishness
and
greed
which
determine
almost
every
one
of
their
activities
suppose
that
we
have
made
it
impossible
by
disassociation
from
them
to
feed
their
greed
they
might
not
wish
to
remain
in
india
as
happened
in
the
case
of
somaliland
where
the
moment
its
administration
ceased
to
be
a
paying
proposition
they
evacuated
it
how
do
you
think
queried
the
representative
in
practice
this
will
work
out
what
i
have
sketched
before
you
said
gandhi
is
the
final
possibility
what
i
expect
is
that
nothing
of
that
kind
will
happen
in
so
far
as
i
understand
the
british
people
i
will
recognise
the
force
of
public
opinion
when
it
has
become
real
and
patent
then
and
only
then
will
they
realise
the
hideous
injustice
which
in
their
name
the
imperial
ministers
and
their
representatives
in
india
have
perpetrated
they
will
therefore
remedy
the
two
wrongs
in
accordance
with
the
wishes
of
the
people
and
they
will
also
offer
a
constitution
exactly
in
accordance
with
the
wishes
of
the
people
of
india
as
represented
by
their
chosen
leaders
supposing
that
the
british
government
wish
to
retire
because
india
is
not
a
paying
concern
what
do
you
think
will
then
be
the
position
of
india
gandhi
answered
at
that
stage
surely
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
india
will
then
have
evolved
either
outstanding
spiritual
height
or
the
ability
to
offer
violence
against
violence
she
will
have
evolved
an
organising
ability
of
a
high
order
and
will
therefore
be
in
every
way
able
to
cope
with
any
emergency
that
might
arise
in
other
words
observed
the
representative
you
expect
the
moment
of
the
british
evacuation
if
such
a
contingency
arises
will
coincide
with
the
moment
of
india
preparedness
and
ability
and
conditions
favourable
for
india
to
take
over
the
indian
administration
as
a
going
concern
and
work
it
for
the
benefit
and
advancement
of
the
nation
gandhi
answered
the
question
with
an
emphatic
affirmative
my
experience
during
the
last
months
fills
me
with
the
hope
continued
gandhi
that
within
the
nine
months
that
remain
of
the
year
in
which
i
have
expected
swaraj
for
india
we
shall
redress
the
two
wrongs
and
we
shall
see
swaraj
established
in
accordance
with
the
wishes
of
the
people
of
india
where
will
the
present
government
be
at
the
end
of
the
nine
months
asked
the
representative
gandhi
with
a
significant
smile
said
the
lion
will
then
lie
with
the
lamb
india
december
the
attainment
of
swaraj
gandhi
in
moving
his
resolution
on
the
creed
before
the
congress
said
the
resolution
which
i
have
the
honour
to
move
is
as
follows
the
object
of
the
indian
national
congress
is
the
attainment
of
swarajya
by
the
people
of
india
by
all
legitimate
and
peaceful
means
there
are
only
two
kinds
of
objections
so
far
as
i
understand
that
will
be
advanced
from
this
platform
one
is
that
we
may
not
think
of
dissolving
the
british
connection
what
i
say
is
that
it
is
derogatory
to
national
dignity
to
think
of
permanence
of
british
connection
at
any
cost
we
are
labouring
under
a
grievous
wrong
which
it
is
the
personal
duty
of
every
indian
to
get
redressed
this
british
government
not
only
refused
to
redress
the
wrong
but
it
refuses
to
acknowledge
mistake
and
so
long
as
it
retains
its
attitude
it
is
not
possible
for
us
to
say
all
that
we
want
to
be
or
all
that
we
want
to
get
retaining
british
connection
no
matter
what
difficulties
be
in
our
path
we
must
make
the
clearest
possible
declaration
to
the
world
and
to
the
whole
of
india
that
we
may
not
possibly
have
british
connection
if
the
british
people
will
not
do
this
elementary
justice
i
do
not
for
one
moment
suggest
that
we
want
to
end
at
the
british
connection
at
all
costs
unconditionally
if
the
british
connection
is
for
the
advancement
of
india
we
do
not
want
to
destroy
it
but
if
it
is
inconsistent
with
our
national
self
respect
then
it
is
our
bounden
duty
to
destroy
it
there
is
room
in
this
resolution
for
both
those
who
believe
that
by
retaining
british
connection
we
can
purify
ourselves
and
purify
british
people
and
those
who
have
no
belief
as
for
instance
take
the
extreme
case
of
andrews
he
says
all
hope
for
india
is
gone
for
keeping
the
british
connection
he
says
there
must
be
complete
severance
complete
independence
there
is
room
enough
in
this
creed
for
a
man
like
andrews
also
take
another
illustration
a
man
like
myself
or
my
brother
shaukat
ali
there
is
certainly
no
room
for
us
if
we
have
eternally
to
subscribe
to
the
doctrine
whether
these
wrongs
are
redressed
or
not
we
shall
have
to
evolve
ourselves
within
the
british
empire
there
is
no
room
for
me
in
that
creed
therefore
this
creed
is
elastic
enough
to
take
in
both
shades
of
opinions
and
the
british
people
will
have
to
beware
that
if
they
do
not
want
to
do
justice
it
will
be
the
bounden
duty
of
every
indian
to
destroy
the
empire
i
want
just
now
to
wind
up
my
remarks
with
a
personal
appeal
drawing
your
attention
to
an
object
lesson
that
was
presented
in
the
bengal
camp
yesterday
if
you
want
swaraj
you
have
got
a
demonstration
of
how
to
get
swaraj
there
was
a
little
bit
of
skirmish
a
little
bit
of
squabble
and
a
little
bit
of
difference
in
the
bengal
camp
as
there
will
always
be
differences
so
long
as
the
world
lasts
i
have
known
differences
between
husband
and
wife
because
i
am
still
a
husband
i
have
noticed
differences
between
parents
and
children
because
i
am
still
a
father
of
four
boys
and
they
are
all
strong
enough
to
destroy
their
father
so
far
as
bodily
struggle
is
concerned
i
possess
that
varied
experience
of
husband
and
parent
i
know
that
we
shall
always
have
squabbles
we
shall
always
have
differences
but
the
lesson
that
i
want
to
draw
your
attention
to
is
that
i
had
the
honour
and
privilege
of
addressing
both
the
parties
they
gave
me
their
undivided
attention
and
what
is
more
they
showed
their
attachment
their
affection
and
their
fellowship
for
me
by
accepting
the
humble
advice
that
i
had
the
honour
of
tendering
to
them
and
i
told
them
i
am
not
here
to
distribute
justice
that
can
be
awarded
only
through
our
worthy
president
but
i
ask
you
not
to
go
to
the
president
you
need
not
worry
him
if
you
are
strong
if
you
are
brave
if
you
are
intent
upon
getting
swaraj
and
if
you
really
want
to
revise
the
creed
then
you
will
bottle
up
your
rage
you
will
bottle
up
all
the
feelings
of
injustice
that
may
rankle
in
your
hearts
and
forget
these
things
here
under
this
very
roof
and
i
told
them
to
forget
their
differences
to
forgot
the
wrongs
i
do
want
to
tell
you
or
go
into
the
history
of
that
incident
probably
most
of
you
know
i
simply
want
to
invite
your
attention
to
the
fact
i
do
say
they
have
settled
up
their
differences
i
hope
they
have
but
i
do
know
that
they
undertook
to
forget
the
differences
they
undertook
not
to
worry
the
president
they
undertook
not
to
make
any
demonstration
here
or
in
the
subjects
committee
all
honour
to
those
who
listened
to
that
advice
i
only
wanted
my
bengali
friends
and
all
the
other
friends
who
have
come
to
this
great
assembly
with
a
fixed
determination
to
seek
nothing
but
the
settlement
of
their
country
to
seek
nothing
but
the
advancement
of
their
respective
rights
to
seek
nothing
but
the
conservation
of
the
national
honour
i
appeal
to
every
one
of
you
to
copy
the
example
set
by
those
who
felt
aggrieved
and
who
felt
that
their
heads
were
broken
i
know
before
we
have
done
with
this
great
battle
on
which
we
have
embarked
at
the
special
sessions
of
the
congress
we
have
to
go
probably
possibly
through
a
sea
of
blood
but
let
it
not
be
said
of
us
or
any
one
of
us
that
we
are
guilty
of
shedding
blood
but
let
it
be
said
by
generations
yet
to
be
born
that
we
suffered
that
we
shed
not
somebody
blood
but
our
own
and
so
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
i
do
not
want
to
show
much
sympathy
for
those
who
had
their
heads
broken
or
who
were
said
to
be
even
in
danger
of
losing
their
lives
what
does
it
matter
it
is
much
better
to
die
at
the
hands
at
least
of
our
own
countrymen
what
is
there
to
revenge
ourselves
about
or
upon
so
i
ask
everyone
of
you
that
if
at
any
time
there
is
within
you
against
some
fellow
countrymen
of
yours
even
though
he
may
be
in
the
employ
of
government
though
he
may
be
in
the
secret
service
you
will
take
care
not
to
be
offended
and
not
to
return
blow
for
blow
understand
that
the
very
moment
you
return
the
blow
from
the
detective
your
cause
is
lost
this
is
your
campaign
and
so
i
ask
everyone
of
you
not
to
retaliate
but
to
bottle
up
all
your
rage
to
dismiss
your
rage
from
you
and
you
will
rise
graver
men
i
am
here
to
congratulate
those
who
have
restrained
themselves
from
going
to
the
president
and
bringing
the
dispute
before
him
therefore
i
appeal
to
those
who
feel
aggrieved
to
feel
that
they
have
done
the
right
thing
in
forgetting
it
and
if
they
have
not
forgotten
i
ask
them
to
try
to
forget
the
thing
and
that
is
the
object
lesson
to
which
i
wanted
to
draw
your
attention
if
you
want
to
carry
this
resolution
do
not
carry
this
resolution
only
by
an
acclamation
for
this
resolution
but
i
want
you
to
accompany
the
carrying
out
of
this
resolution
with
a
faith
and
resolve
which
nothing
on
earth
can
move
that
you
are
intent
upon
getting
swaraj
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
and
that
you
are
intent
upon
getting
swaraj
by
means
that
are
legitimate
that
are
honourable
and
by
means
that
are
that
are
peaceful
you
have
resolved
upon
so
far
you
can
say
we
can
not
give
battle
to
this
government
by
means
of
steel
but
we
can
give
battle
by
exercising
what
i
have
so
often
called
soul
force
and
soul
force
is
not
the
prerogative
of
one
man
of
a
sanyasi
or
even
a
saint
soul
force
is
the
prerogative
of
every
human
being
female
or
male
and
therefore
i
ask
my
countrymen
if
they
want
to
accept
this
resolution
to
accept
it
with
that
firm
determination
and
to
understand
that
it
is
inaugurated
under
such
good
and
favourable
auspices
as
i
have
described
to
you
in
my
humble
opinion
the
congress
will
have
done
the
rightest
thing
if
it
unanimously
adopts
this
resolution
may
god
grant
that
you
will
pass
this
resolution
unanimously
may
god
grant
that
you
will
also
have
the
courage
and
the
ability
to
carry
out
the
resolution
and
that
within
one
year
hindu
moslem
unity
a
dialogue
between
editor
and
reader
on
the
unity
home
the
hindus
and
the
mahomedans
editor
your
last
question
is
a
serious
one
and
yet
on
careful
consideration
it
will
be
found
to
be
easy
of
solution
the
question
arises
because
of
the
presence
of
the
railways
of
the
lawyers
and
of
the
doctors
we
shall
presently
examine
the
last
two
we
have
already
considered
the
railways
i
should
however
like
to
add
that
man
is
so
made
by
nature
as
to
require
him
to
restrict
his
movements
as
far
as
his
hands
and
feet
will
take
him
if
we
did
not
rush
about
from
place
to
place
by
means
of
railways
such
other
maddening
conveniences
much
of
the
confusion
that
arises
would
be
obviated
our
difficulties
are
of
our
own
creation
god
set
a
limit
to
a
man
locomotive
ambition
in
the
construction
of
his
body
man
immediately
proceeded
to
discover
means
of
overriding
the
limit
god
gifted
man
with
intellect
that
he
might
know
his
maker
man
abused
it
so
that
he
might
forget
his
maker
i
am
so
constructed
that
i
can
only
serve
my
immediate
neighbours
but
in
my
conceit
i
pretend
to
have
discovered
that
i
must
with
my
body
serve
every
individual
in
the
universe
in
thus
attempting
the
impossible
man
comes
in
contact
with
different
natures
different
religions
and
is
utterly
confounded
according
to
this
reasoning
it
must
be
apparent
to
you
that
railways
are
a
most
dangerous
institution
man
has
therefore
gone
further
away
from
his
maker
reader
but
i
am
impatient
to
hear
your
answer
to
my
question
has
the
introduction
of
mahomedanism
not
unmade
the
nation
editor
india
can
not
cease
to
be
one
nation
because
people
belonging
to
different
religions
live
in
it
the
introduction
of
foreigners
does
not
necessarily
destroy
the
nation
they
merge
in
it
a
country
is
one
nation
only
when
such
a
condition
obtains
in
it
that
country
must
have
a
faculty
for
assimilation
india
has
ever
been
such
a
country
in
reality
there
are
as
many
religions
as
there
are
individuals
but
those
who
are
conscious
of
the
spirit
of
nationality
do
not
interfere
with
one
another
religion
if
they
do
they
are
not
fit
to
be
considered
a
nation
if
the
hindus
believe
that
india
should
be
peopled
only
by
hindus
they
are
living
in
dreamland
the
hindus
the
mahomedans
the
parsees
and
the
christians
who
have
made
india
their
country
are
fellow
countrymen
and
they
will
have
to
live
in
unity
if
only
for
their
own
interest
in
no
part
of
the
world
are
one
nationality
and
one
religion
synonymous
terms
nor
has
it
ever
been
so
in
india
reader
but
what
about
the
inborn
enmity
between
hindus
and
mahomedans
editor
that
phrase
has
been
invented
by
our
mutual
enemy
when
the
hindus
and
mahomedans
fought
against
one
another
they
certainly
spoke
in
that
strain
they
have
long
since
ceased
to
fight
how
then
can
there
be
any
inborn
enmity
pray
remember
this
too
that
we
did
not
cease
to
fight
only
after
british
occupation
the
hindus
flourished
under
moslem
sovereigns
and
moslems
under
the
hindu
each
party
recognised
that
mutual
fighting
was
suicidal
and
that
neither
party
would
abandon
its
religion
by
force
of
arms
both
parties
therefore
decided
to
live
in
peace
with
the
english
advent
the
quarrels
recommenced
the
proverbs
you
have
quoted
were
coined
when
both
were
fighting
to
quote
them
now
is
obviously
harmful
should
we
not
remember
that
many
hindus
and
mahomedans
own
the
same
ancestors
and
the
same
blood
runs
through
their
veins
do
people
become
enemies
because
they
change
their
religion
is
the
god
of
the
mahomedan
different
from
the
god
of
the
hindu
religions
are
different
roads
converging
to
the
same
point
what
does
it
matter
that
we
take
different
roads
so
long
as
we
reach
the
same
goal
wherein
is
the
cause
for
quarrelling
moreover
there
are
deadly
proverbs
as
between
the
followers
of
shiva
and
those
of
vishnu
yet
nobody
suggests
that
these
two
do
not
belong
to
the
same
nation
it
is
said
that
the
vedic
religion
is
different
from
jainism
but
the
followers
of
the
respective
faiths
are
not
different
nations
the
fact
is
that
we
have
become
enslaved
and
therefore
quarrel
and
like
to
have
our
quarrels
decided
by
a
third
party
there
are
hindu
iconoclasts
as
there
are
mahomedan
the
more
we
advance
in
true
knowledge
the
better
we
shall
understand
that
we
need
not
be
at
war
with
those
whose
religion
we
may
not
follow
reader
now
i
would
like
to
know
your
views
about
cow
protection
editor
i
myself
respect
the
cow
that
is
i
look
upon
her
with
affectionate
reverence
the
cow
is
the
protector
of
india
because
it
being
an
agricultural
country
is
dependent
on
the
cow
progeny
she
is
a
most
useful
animal
in
hundreds
of
ways
our
mahomedan
brethren
will
admit
this
but
just
as
i
respect
the
cow
so
do
i
respect
my
a
man
is
just
as
useful
as
a
cow
no
matter
whether
he
be
a
mahomedan
or
a
hindu
am
i
then
to
fight
with
or
kill
a
mahomedan
in
order
to
save
a
cow
in
doing
so
i
would
become
an
enemy
as
well
of
the
cow
as
of
the
mahomedan
therefore
the
only
method
i
know
of
protecting
the
cow
is
that
i
should
approach
my
mahomedan
brother
and
urge
him
for
the
sake
of
the
country
to
join
me
in
protecting
her
if
he
would
not
listen
to
me
i
should
let
the
cow
go
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
matter
is
beyond
my
ability
if
i
were
over
full
of
pity
for
the
cow
i
should
sacrifice
my
life
to
save
her
but
not
take
my
brother
this
i
hold
is
the
law
of
our
religion
when
men
become
obstinate
it
is
a
difficult
thing
if
i
pull
one
way
my
moslem
brother
will
pull
another
if
i
put
on
a
superior
air
he
will
return
the
compliment
if
i
bow
to
him
gently
he
will
do
it
much
more
so
and
if
he
does
not
i
shall
not
be
considered
to
have
done
wrong
in
having
bowed
when
the
hindus
became
insistent
the
killing
of
cows
increased
in
my
opinion
cow
protection
societies
may
be
considered
cow
killing
societies
it
is
a
disgrace
to
us
that
we
should
need
such
societies
when
we
forgot
how
to
protect
cows
i
suppose
we
needed
such
societies
what
am
i
to
do
when
a
is
on
the
point
of
killing
a
cow
am
i
to
kill
him
or
to
fall
down
at
his
feet
and
implore
him
if
you
admit
that
i
should
adopt
the
latter
course
i
must
do
the
same
to
my
moslem
brother
who
protects
the
cow
from
destruction
by
hindus
when
they
cruelly
her
whoever
reasons
with
the
hindus
when
they
mercilessly
belabour
the
progeny
of
the
cow
with
their
sticks
but
this
has
not
prevented
us
from
remaining
one
nation
lastly
if
it
be
true
that
the
hindus
believe
in
the
doctrine
of
and
the
mahomedans
do
not
what
i
pray
is
the
duty
of
the
former
it
is
not
written
that
a
follower
of
the
religion
of
ahimsa
may
kill
a
for
him
the
way
is
straight
in
order
to
save
one
being
he
may
not
kill
another
he
can
only
plead
therein
lies
his
sole
duty
but
does
every
hindu
believe
in
ahimsa
going
to
the
root
of
the
matter
not
one
man
really
practises
such
a
religion
because
we
do
destroy
life
we
are
said
to
follow
that
religion
because
we
want
to
obtain
freedom
from
liability
to
kill
any
kind
of
life
generally
speaking
we
may
observe
that
many
hindus
partake
of
meat
and
are
not
therefore
followers
of
ahimsa
it
is
therefore
preposterous
to
suggest
that
the
two
can
not
live
together
amicably
because
the
hindus
believe
in
ahimsa
and
the
mahomedans
do
not
these
thoughts
are
put
into
our
minds
by
selfish
and
false
religious
teachers
the
english
put
the
finishing
touch
they
have
a
habit
of
writing
history
they
pretend
to
study
the
manners
and
customs
of
all
peoples
god
has
given
us
a
limited
mental
capacity
but
they
usurp
the
function
of
the
godhead
and
indulge
in
novel
experiments
they
write
about
their
own
researches
in
most
laudatory
terms
and
hypnotise
us
into
believing
them
we
in
our
ignorance
then
fall
at
their
feet
those
who
do
not
wish
to
misunderstand
things
may
read
up
the
koran
and
will
find
therein
hundreds
of
passages
acceptable
to
the
hindus
and
the
bhagavad
gita
contains
passages
to
which
not
a
mahomedan
can
take
exception
am
i
to
dislike
a
mahomedan
because
there
are
passages
in
the
koran
i
do
not
understand
or
like
it
takes
two
to
make
a
quarrel
if
i
do
not
want
to
quarrel
with
a
mahomedan
the
latter
will
be
powerless
to
foist
a
quarrel
on
me
and
similarly
i
should
be
powerless
if
a
mahomedan
refuses
his
assistance
to
quarrel
with
me
an
arm
striking
the
air
will
become
disjointed
if
everyone
will
try
to
understand
the
core
of
his
own
religion
and
adhere
to
it
and
will
not
allow
false
teachers
to
dictate
to
him
there
will
be
no
room
left
for
quarrelling
reader
but
will
the
english
ever
allow
the
two
bodies
to
join
hands
editor
this
question
arises
out
of
your
timidity
it
betrays
our
shallowness
if
two
brothers
want
to
live
in
peace
is
it
possible
for
a
third
party
to
separate
them
if
they
were
to
listen
to
evil
counsels
we
would
consider
them
to
be
foolish
similarly
we
hindus
and
mahomedans
would
have
to
blame
our
folly
rather
than
the
english
if
we
allowed
them
to
put
asunder
a
clay
pot
would
break
through
impact
if
not
with
one
stone
thou
with
another
the
way
to
save
the
pot
is
not
to
keep
it
away
from
the
danger
point
but
to
bake
it
so
that
no
stone
would
break
it
we
have
then
to
make
our
hearts
of
perfectly
baked
clay
then
we
shall
be
steeled
against
all
danger
this
can
be
easily
done
by
the
hindus
they
are
superior
in
numbers
they
pretend
that
they
are
more
educated
they
are
therefore
better
able
to
shield
themselves
from
attack
on
their
amicable
relations
with
the
mahomedans
there
is
a
mutual
distrust
between
the
two
communities
the
mahomedans
therefore
ask
for
certain
concessions
from
lord
morley
why
should
the
hindus
oppose
this
if
the
hindus
desisted
the
english
would
notice
it
the
mahomedans
would
gradually
begin
to
trust
the
hindus
and
brotherliness
would
be
the
outcome
we
should
be
ashamed
to
take
our
quarrels
to
the
english
everyone
can
find
out
for
himself
that
the
hindus
can
lose
nothing
be
desisting
the
man
who
has
inspired
confidence
in
another
has
never
lost
anything
in
this
world
i
do
not
suggest
that
the
hindus
and
the
mahomedans
will
never
fight
two
brothers
living
together
often
do
so
we
shall
sometimes
have
our
heads
broken
such
a
thing
ought
not
to
be
necessary
but
all
men
are
not
when
people
are
in
a
rage
they
do
many
foolish
things
these
we
have
to
put
up
with
but
when
we
do
quarrel
we
certainly
do
not
want
to
engage
counsel
and
to
resort
to
english
or
any
two
men
fight
both
have
their
heads
broken
or
one
only
how
shall
a
third
party
distribute
justice
amongst
them
those
who
fight
may
expect
to
be
injured
unity
candler
some
time
ago
asked
me
in
an
imaginary
interview
whether
if
i
was
sincere
in
my
professions
of
unity
i
would
eat
and
drink
with
a
mahomedean
and
give
my
daughter
in
marriage
to
a
mahomedan
this
question
has
been
asked
again
by
some
friends
in
another
form
is
it
necessary
for
hindu
mahomedan
unity
that
there
should
he
interdining
and
intermarrying
the
questioners
say
that
if
the
two
are
necessary
real
unity
can
never
take
place
because
crores
of
would
never
reconcile
themselves
to
interdining
much
less
to
intermarriage
i
am
one
of
those
who
do
not
consider
caste
to
be
a
harmful
institution
in
its
origin
caste
was
a
wholesome
custom
and
promoted
national
in
my
opinion
the
idea
that
interdining
or
intermarrying
is
necessary
for
national
growth
is
a
superstition
borrowed
from
the
west
eating
is
a
process
just
as
vital
as
the
other
sanitary
necessities
of
life
and
if
mankind
had
not
much
to
its
harm
made
of
eating
a
fetish
and
indulgence
we
would
have
performed
the
operation
of
eating
in
private
even
as
one
performs
the
other
necessary
functions
of
life
in
private
indeed
the
highest
culture
in
hinduism
regards
eating
in
that
light
and
there
are
thousands
of
hindus
still
living
who
will
not
eat
their
food
in
the
presence
of
anybody
i
can
recall
the
names
of
several
cultured
men
and
women
who
ate
their
food
in
entire
privacy
but
who
never
had
any
illwill
against
anybody
and
who
lived
on
the
friendliest
terms
with
all
intermarriage
is
a
still
more
difficult
question
if
brothers
and
sisters
can
live
on
the
friendliest
footing
without
ever
thinking
of
marrying
each
other
i
can
see
no
difficulty
in
my
daughter
regarding
every
mahomedan
brother
and
i
hold
strong
views
on
religion
and
on
marriage
the
greater
the
restraint
we
exercise
with
regard
to
our
appetites
whether
about
eating
or
marrying
the
better
we
become
from
a
religious
standpoint
i
should
despair
of
ever
cultivating
amicable
relations
with
the
world
if
i
had
to
recognise
the
right
or
the
propriety
of
any
young
man
offering
his
hand
in
marriage
to
my
daughter
or
to
regard
it
as
necessary
for
me
to
dine
with
anybody
and
everybody
i
claim
that
i
am
living
on
terms
of
friendliness
with
the
whole
world
i
have
never
quarrelled
with
a
single
mahomedan
or
christian
but
for
years
i
have
taken
nothing
but
fruit
in
mahomedan
or
christian
households
i
would
most
certainly
decline
to
eat
food
cooked
from
the
same
plate
with
my
son
or
to
drink
water
out
of
a
cup
which
his
lips
have
touched
and
which
has
not
been
washed
but
the
restraint
or
the
exclusiveness
exercised
in
these
matters
by
me
has
never
affected
the
closest
companionship
with
the
mahomedan
or
the
christian
friends
or
my
sons
but
interdining
and
intermarriage
have
never
been
a
bar
to
disunion
quarrels
and
worse
the
pandavas
and
the
kauravas
flew
at
one
throats
without
compunction
although
they
interdined
and
intermarried
the
bitterness
between
the
english
and
the
germans
has
not
yet
died
out
the
fact
is
that
intermarriage
and
interdining
are
not
necessary
factors
in
friendship
and
unity
though
they
are
often
emblems
thereof
but
insistence
on
either
the
one
or
the
other
can
easily
become
and
is
a
bar
to
unity
if
we
make
ourselves
believe
that
hindus
and
mahomedans
can
not
be
one
unless
they
interdine
or
intermarry
we
would
be
creating
an
artificial
barrier
between
us
which
it
might
be
almost
impossible
to
remove
and
it
would
seriously
interfere
with
the
flowing
unity
between
hindus
and
mahomedans
if
for
example
mahomedan
youths
consider
it
lawful
to
court
hindu
girls
the
hindu
parents
will
not
even
if
they
suspected
any
such
thing
freely
admit
mahomedans
to
their
homes
as
they
have
begun
to
do
now
in
my
opinion
it
is
necessary
for
hindu
and
mahomedan
young
men
to
recognise
this
limitation
i
hold
it
to
be
utterly
impossible
for
hindus
and
mahomedans
to
intermarry
and
yet
retain
intact
each
other
religion
and
the
true
beauty
of
unity
lies
in
each
remaining
true
to
his
own
religion
and
yet
being
true
to
each
other
for
we
are
thinking
of
hindus
and
mahomedans
even
of
the
most
orthodox
type
being
able
to
regard
one
another
as
natural
friends
instead
of
regarding
one
another
as
natural
enemies
as
they
have
done
hitherto
what
then
does
the
unity
consist
in
and
how
can
it
be
best
promoted
the
answer
is
simple
it
consists
in
our
having
a
common
purpose
a
common
goal
and
common
sorrows
it
is
best
promoted
by
to
reach
the
common
goal
by
sharing
one
another
sorrow
and
by
mutual
toleration
a
common
goal
we
have
we
wish
this
great
country
of
ours
to
be
greater
and
we
have
enough
sorrows
to
share
and
seeing
that
the
mahomedans
are
deeply
touched
on
the
question
of
khilafat
and
their
case
is
just
nothing
can
be
so
powerful
for
winning
mahomedans
friendship
for
the
hindu
as
to
give
his
support
to
the
mahomedan
claim
no
amount
of
drinking
out
of
the
same
cup
or
dining
out
of
the
same
bowl
can
bind
the
two
as
this
help
in
the
khilafat
question
and
mutual
toleration
is
a
necessity
for
all
time
and
for
all
races
we
can
not
live
in
peace
if
the
hindu
will
not
tolerate
the
mahomedan
form
of
worship
of
god
and
his
manners
and
customs
or
if
the
mahomedans
will
be
impatient
of
hindu
idolatory
it
is
not
necessary
for
toleration
that
i
must
approve
of
what
i
tolerate
i
heartily
dislike
drinking
meat
eating
and
smoking
but
i
tolerate
all
these
in
hindus
mahomedans
and
christians
even
as
i
expect
them
to
tolerate
my
abstinence
from
all
these
although
they
may
dislike
it
all
the
quarrels
between
the
hindus
and
the
mahomedans
have
arisen
from
each
wanting
to
the
other
his
view
unity
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
successful
depends
as
much
on
unity
as
on
greatest
strain
will
be
put
upon
both
in
the
course
of
the
struggle
and
if
it
survives
that
strain
victory
is
a
certainty
a
severe
strain
was
put
upon
it
in
agra
and
it
has
been
stated
that
when
either
party
went
to
the
authorities
they
were
referred
to
maulana
shaukat
ali
and
me
fortunately
there
was
a
far
better
man
at
hand
hakimji
ajmal
khan
is
a
devout
muslim
who
commands
the
confidence
and
the
respect
of
both
the
parties
he
with
his
band
of
workers
hastened
to
agra
settled
the
dispute
and
the
parties
became
friends
as
they
were
never
before
an
incident
occurred
nearer
delhi
and
the
same
influence
worked
successfully
to
avoid
what
might
have
become
an
explosion
but
hakimji
ajmal
khan
can
not
be
everywhere
appearing
at
the
exact
hour
as
an
angel
of
peace
nor
can
maulana
shankat
ali
or
i
go
everywhere
and
yet
perfect
peace
must
be
observed
between
the
two
communities
in
spite
of
attempts
to
divide
them
why
was
there
any
appeal
made
to
the
authorities
at
all
at
agra
if
we
are
to
work
out
with
any
degree
of
success
we
must
be
able
to
dispense
with
the
protection
of
the
government
when
we
quarrel
among
ourselves
the
whole
scheme
of
must
break
to
pieces
if
our
final
reliance
is
to
be
upon
british
intervention
for
the
adjustment
of
our
quarrels
or
the
punishment
of
the
guilty
ones
in
every
village
and
hamlet
there
must
be
at
least
one
hindu
and
one
muslim
whose
primary
business
must
be
to
prevent
quarrels
between
the
two
some
times
however
even
come
to
blows
in
the
initial
stages
we
are
bound
to
do
so
here
and
there
unfortunately
we
who
are
public
workers
have
made
little
attempt
to
understand
and
influence
the
masses
and
least
of
all
the
most
turbulent
among
them
during
the
process
of
insinuating
ourselves
in
the
estimation
of
the
masses
and
until
we
have
gained
control
over
the
unruly
there
are
bound
to
be
exhibitions
of
hasty
temper
now
and
then
we
must
learn
at
such
times
to
do
without
an
appeal
to
the
government
hakimji
ajmal
khan
has
shown
us
how
to
do
it
the
union
that
we
want
is
not
a
patched
up
thing
but
a
union
of
hearts
based
upon
a
definite
recognition
of
the
indubitable
proposition
that
swaraj
for
india
must
be
an
impossible
dream
without
an
indissoluble
union
between
the
hindus
and
the
muslims
of
india
it
must
not
be
a
mere
truce
it
can
not
be
based
upon
mutual
fear
it
must
be
a
partnership
between
equals
each
respecting
the
religion
of
the
other
i
would
frankly
despair
of
reaching
such
union
if
there
was
anything
in
the
holy
quran
enjoining
upon
the
followers
of
islam
to
treat
hindus
as
their
natural
enemies
or
if
there
was
anything
in
hinduism
to
warrant
a
belief
in
the
eternal
enmity
between
the
two
we
would
ill
learn
our
history
if
we
conclude
that
because
we
have
quarrelled
in
the
past
we
are
destined
so
to
continue
unless
some
such
strong
power
like
the
british
keep
us
by
force
of
arms
from
flying
at
each
other
throats
but
i
am
convinced
that
there
is
no
warrant
in
islam
or
hinduism
for
any
such
belief
true
it
is
that
interested
fanatical
priests
in
both
religions
have
set
the
one
against
the
other
it
is
equally
true
that
muslim
rulers
like
christian
rulers
have
used
the
sword
for
the
propagation
of
their
respective
faiths
but
in
spite
of
many
dark
things
of
the
modern
times
the
world
opinion
will
as
little
tolerate
forcible
conversions
as
it
will
tolerate
forcible
slavery
that
probably
is
the
most
effective
contribution
of
the
scientific
spirit
of
the
age
that
spirit
has
revolutionised
many
a
false
notion
about
christianity
as
it
has
about
islam
i
do
not
know
a
single
writer
on
islam
who
defends
the
use
of
force
in
the
proselytising
process
the
influences
exerted
in
our
times
are
far
more
subtle
than
that
of
the
sword
i
believe
that
in
the
midst
of
all
the
bloodshed
chicane
and
fraud
being
resorted
to
on
a
colossal
scale
in
the
west
the
whole
humanity
is
silently
but
surely
making
progress
towards
a
better
age
and
india
by
finding
true
independence
and
through
an
imperishable
unity
and
through
means
unadulterated
self
sacrifice
can
point
a
way
out
of
the
prevailing
darkness
vi
treatment
of
the
depressed
classes
depressed
classes
vivekanand
used
to
call
the
panchamas
classes
there
is
no
doubt
that
vivekanand
is
a
more
accurate
adjective
we
have
suppressed
them
and
have
consequently
become
ourselves
depressed
that
we
have
become
the
of
the
empire
is
in
gokhale
language
the
retributive
justice
meted
out
to
us
by
a
just
god
a
correspondent
indignantly
asks
me
in
a
pathetic
letter
reproduced
elsewhere
what
i
am
doing
for
them
i
have
given
the
letter
with
the
correspondent
own
heading
should
not
we
the
hindus
wash
our
bloodstained
hands
before
we
ask
the
english
to
wash
theirs
this
is
a
proper
question
reasonably
put
and
if
a
member
of
a
slave
nation
could
deliver
the
suppressed
classes
from
their
slavery
without
freeing
myself
from
my
own
i
would
do
so
to
day
but
it
is
an
impossible
task
a
slave
has
not
the
freedom
even
to
do
the
right
thing
it
is
a
right
for
me
to
prohibit
the
importation
of
foreign
goods
but
i
have
no
power
to
bring
it
about
it
was
right
for
maulana
mahomed
ali
to
go
to
turkey
and
to
tell
the
turks
personally
that
india
was
with
them
in
their
righteous
struggle
he
was
not
free
to
do
so
if
i
had
a
truly
national
legislative
i
would
answer
hindu
insolence
by
creating
special
and
better
wells
for
the
exclusive
use
of
suppressed
classes
and
by
erecting
better
and
more
numerous
schools
for
them
so
that
there
would
be
not
a
single
member
of
the
suppressed
classes
left
without
a
school
to
teach
their
children
but
i
must
wait
for
that
better
day
meanwhile
are
the
depressed
classes
to
be
loft
to
their
own
resources
nothing
of
the
sort
in
my
own
humble
manner
i
have
done
and
am
doing
all
i
can
for
my
panchama
brother
there
are
three
courses
open
to
those
downtrodden
members
of
the
nation
for
their
impatience
they
may
call
in
the
assistance
of
the
slave
owning
government
they
will
get
it
but
they
will
fall
from
the
frying
pan
into
the
fire
they
are
slaves
of
slaves
by
seeking
government
aid
they
will
be
used
for
suppressing
their
kith
and
kin
instead
of
being
sinned
against
they
will
themselves
be
the
sinners
the
mussalmans
tried
it
and
failed
they
found
that
they
were
worse
off
than
before
the
sikhs
did
it
unwittingly
and
failed
there
is
no
more
discontented
community
in
india
than
the
sikhs
government
aid
is
therefore
no
solution
the
second
is
rejection
of
hinduism
and
wholesale
conversion
to
islam
or
christianity
and
if
a
change
of
religion
could
be
justified
for
worldly
betterment
i
would
advise
it
without
hesitation
but
religion
is
a
matter
of
the
heart
no
physical
inconvenience
can
warrant
abandonment
of
one
own
religion
if
the
inhuman
treatment
of
the
panchamas
were
a
part
of
hinduism
its
rejection
would
be
a
paramount
duty
both
for
them
and
for
those
like
me
who
would
not
make
a
fetish
even
of
religion
and
condone
every
evil
in
its
sacred
name
but
i
believe
that
untouchability
is
no
part
of
hinduism
it
is
rather
its
excrescence
to
be
removed
by
every
effort
and
there
is
quite
an
army
of
hindu
reformers
who
have
set
their
heart
upon
ridding
hinduism
of
this
blot
conversion
therefore
i
hold
is
no
remedy
whatsoever
then
there
remains
finally
and
with
such
aid
as
the
hindus
will
render
of
their
own
motion
not
as
a
matter
of
patronage
but
as
a
matter
of
duty
and
herein
comes
the
use
of
my
correspondent
was
correctly
informed
by
rajagopaluchari
and
hanumantarao
that
i
would
favour
for
this
acknowledged
evil
but
means
independence
of
outside
help
it
means
effort
from
within
it
would
not
be
to
insist
on
visiting
prohibited
areas
that
may
be
civil
disobedience
if
it
is
peacefully
carried
out
but
i
have
found
to
my
cost
that
civil
disobedience
requires
far
greater
preliminary
training
and
all
can
but
few
only
can
offer
civil
disobedience
therefore
by
way
of
protest
against
hinduism
the
panchamas
can
certainly
stop
all
contact
and
connection
with
the
other
hindus
so
long
as
special
grievances
are
maintained
but
this
means
organised
intelligent
effort
and
so
far
as
i
can
see
there
is
no
leader
among
the
panchamas
who
can
lead
them
to
victory
through
the
better
way
therefore
perhaps
is
for
the
panchamas
heartily
to
join
the
great
national
movement
that
is
now
going
on
for
throwing
off
the
slavery
of
the
present
government
it
is
easy
enough
for
the
panchama
friends
to
see
that
against
this
evil
government
presupposes
between
the
different
sections
forming
the
indian
nation
the
hindus
must
realise
that
if
they
wish
to
offer
successful
against
the
government
they
must
make
common
cause
with
the
panchamas
even
as
they
have
made
common
cause
with
the
mussalmans
with
it
is
free
from
violence
is
essentially
a
movement
of
intensive
that
process
has
commenced
and
whether
the
panchamas
deliberately
take
part
in
it
or
not
the
rest
of
the
hindus
dare
not
neglect
them
without
hampering
their
own
progress
hence
though
the
panchama
problem
is
as
dear
to
me
as
life
itself
i
rest
satisfied
with
the
exclusive
attention
to
national
i
feel
sure
that
the
greater
includes
the
less
closely
allied
to
this
question
is
the
question
i
wish
i
had
studied
it
more
closely
than
i
have
been
able
to
a
quotation
from
my
speech
delivered
at
a
private
meeting
in
madras
has
been
torn
from
its
context
and
misused
to
further
the
antagonism
between
the
brahmins
and
the
i
do
not
wish
to
retract
a
word
of
what
i
said
at
that
meeting
i
was
appealing
to
those
who
are
accepted
as
brahmins
i
told
them
that
in
my
opinion
the
treatment
of
by
the
brahmins
was
as
satanic
as
the
treatment
of
us
by
the
british
i
added
that
the
should
be
placated
without
any
ado
or
bargaining
but
my
remarks
were
never
intended
to
encourage
the
powerful
of
maharashira
or
madras
or
the
mischievous
element
among
them
to
overawe
the
brahmins
i
use
the
word
advisedly
for
the
brahmins
who
have
freed
themselves
from
the
thraldom
of
superstitious
orthodoxy
have
not
only
no
quarrel
with
as
such
but
are
in
every
way
eager
to
advance
wherever
they
are
weak
no
lover
of
his
country
can
possibly
achieve
its
general
advance
if
he
dared
to
neglect
the
least
of
his
countrymen
those
therefore
who
are
coqueting
with
the
government
are
selling
themselves
and
the
nation
to
which
they
belong
by
all
means
let
those
who
have
faith
in
the
government
help
to
sustain
it
but
let
no
indian
worthy
of
his
birth
cut
off
his
nose
to
spite
the
face
amelioration
of
the
depressed
classes
the
resolution
of
the
senate
of
the
gujarat
national
university
in
regard
to
andrews
question
about
the
admission
of
children
of
the
classes
to
the
schools
affiliated
to
that
university
is
reported
to
have
raised
a
flutter
in
ahmedabad
not
only
has
the
flutter
given
satisfaction
to
a
of
india
correspondent
but
the
occasion
has
led
to
the
discovery
by
him
of
another
defect
in
the
constitution
of
the
senate
in
that
it
does
not
contain
a
single
muslim
member
the
discovery
however
i
may
inform
the
reader
is
no
proof
of
the
want
of
national
character
of
the
university
the
unity
is
no
mere
lip
expression
it
requires
no
artificial
proofs
the
simple
reason
why
there
is
no
mussalman
representative
on
the
senate
is
that
no
higher
educated
mussalman
able
to
give
his
time
has
been
found
to
take
sufficient
interest
in
the
national
education
movement
i
merely
refer
to
this
matter
to
show
that
we
must
reckon
with
attempts
to
discredit
the
movement
even
misinterpretation
of
motives
that
is
a
difficulty
from
without
and
easier
to
deal
with
the
classes
difficulty
is
internal
and
therefore
far
more
serious
because
it
may
give
rise
to
a
split
and
weaken
the
cause
no
cause
can
survive
internal
difficulties
if
they
are
indefinitely
multiplied
yet
there
can
be
no
surrender
in
the
matter
of
principles
for
the
avoidance
of
splits
you
can
not
promote
a
cause
when
you
are
undermining
it
by
surrendering
its
vital
parts
the
depressed
classes
problem
is
a
vital
part
of
the
cause
is
as
inconceivable
without
full
reparation
to
the
classes
as
it
is
impossible
without
real
unity
in
my
opinion
we
have
become
of
the
empire
because
we
have
created
in
our
midst
the
slave
owner
is
always
more
hurt
than
the
slave
we
shall
be
unfit
to
gain
swaraj
so
long
as
we
would
keep
in
bondage
a
fifth
of
the
population
of
hindustan
have
we
not
made
the
crawl
on
his
belly
have
we
not
segregated
him
and
if
it
is
religion
so
to
treat
the
it
is
the
religion
of
the
white
race
to
segregate
us
and
if
it
is
no
argument
for
the
white
races
to
say
that
we
are
satisfied
with
the
badge
of
our
inferiority
it
is
less
for
us
to
say
that
the
is
satisfied
with
his
our
slavery
is
complete
when
we
begin
to
hug
it
the
gujarat
senate
therefore
counted
the
cost
when
it
refused
to
bend
before
the
storm
this
is
a
process
of
we
may
not
cling
to
putrid
customs
and
claim
the
pure
boon
of
untouchability
i
hold
is
a
custom
not
an
integral
part
of
hinduism
the
world
advanced
in
thought
though
it
is
still
barbarous
in
action
and
no
religion
can
stand
that
which
is
not
based
on
fundamental
truths
any
glorification
of
error
will
destroy
a
religion
as
surely
as
disregard
of
a
disease
is
bound
to
destroy
a
body
this
government
of
ours
is
an
unscrupulous
corporation
it
has
ruled
by
dividing
mussalmans
from
hindus
it
is
quite
capable
of
taking
advantage
of
the
internal
weaknesses
of
hinduism
it
will
set
the
classes
against
the
rest
of
the
hindus
against
brahmins
the
gujarat
senate
resolution
does
not
end
the
trouble
it
merely
points
out
the
difficulty
the
trouble
will
end
only
when
the
masses
and
classes
of
hindus
have
rid
themselves
of
the
sin
of
untouchability
a
hindu
lover
of
swaraj
will
as
assiduously
work
for
the
amelioration
of
the
lot
of
the
classes
as
he
works
for
unity
we
must
treat
them
as
our
brothers
and
give
them
the
same
rights
that
we
claim
for
ourselves
the
sin
of
untouchability
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
the
subjects
committee
accepted
without
any
opposition
the
clause
regarding
the
sin
of
untouchability
it
is
well
that
the
national
assembly
passed
the
resolution
stating
that
the
removal
of
this
blot
on
hinduism
was
necessary
for
the
attainment
of
swaraj
the
devil
succeeds
only
by
receiving
help
from
his
fellows
he
always
takes
advantage
of
the
weakest
spots
in
our
natures
in
order
to
gain
mastery
over
us
even
so
does
the
government
retain
its
control
over
us
through
our
weaknesses
or
vices
and
if
we
would
render
ourselves
proof
against
its
machination
we
must
remove
our
weaknesses
it
is
for
that
reason
that
i
have
called
a
process
of
purification
as
soon
as
that
process
is
completed
this
government
must
fall
to
pieces
for
want
of
the
necessary
environment
just
as
mosquitos
cease
to
haunt
a
place
whose
are
filled
up
and
dried
has
not
a
just
nemesis
overtaken
us
for
the
crime
of
untouchability
have
we
not
reaped
as
we
have
sown
have
we
not
practised
dwyerism
and
on
our
own
kith
and
kin
we
have
segregated
the
and
we
are
in
turn
segregated
in
the
british
colonies
we
deny
him
the
use
of
public
wells
we
throw
the
leavings
of
our
plates
at
him
his
very
shadow
pollutes
us
indeed
there
is
no
charge
that
the
can
not
fling
in
our
faces
and
which
we
do
not
fling
in
the
faces
of
englishmen
how
is
this
blot
on
hinduism
to
be
removed
unto
others
as
you
would
that
others
should
do
unto
you
i
have
often
told
english
officials
that
if
they
are
friends
and
servants
of
india
they
should
come
down
from
their
pedestal
cease
to
be
patrons
demonstrate
by
their
loving
deeds
that
they
are
in
every
respect
our
friends
and
believe
us
to
be
equals
in
the
same
sense
they
believe
fellow
englishmen
to
be
their
equals
after
the
experiences
of
the
punjab
and
the
khilafat
i
have
gone
a
step
further
and
asked
them
to
repent
and
to
change
their
hearts
even
so
is
it
necessary
for
us
hindus
to
repent
of
the
wrong
we
have
done
to
alter
our
behaviour
towards
those
whom
we
have
by
a
system
as
devilish
as
we
believe
the
english
system
of
the
government
of
india
to
be
we
must
not
throw
a
few
miserable
schools
at
them
we
must
not
adopt
the
air
of
superiority
towards
them
we
must
treat
them
as
our
blood
brothers
as
they
are
in
fact
we
must
return
to
them
the
inheritance
of
which
we
have
robbed
them
and
this
must
not
be
the
act
of
a
few
reformers
merely
but
it
must
be
a
conscious
voluntary
effort
on
the
part
of
the
masses
we
may
not
wait
till
eternity
for
this
much
belated
reformation
we
must
aim
at
bringing
it
about
within
this
year
of
grace
probation
preparation
and
it
is
a
reform
not
to
follow
but
to
precede
it
untouchability
is
not
a
sanction
of
religion
it
is
a
devise
of
satan
the
devil
has
always
quoted
scriptures
but
scriptures
can
not
transcend
reason
and
truth
they
are
intended
to
purify
reason
and
illuminate
truth
i
am
not
going
to
burn
a
spotless
horse
because
the
vedas
are
reported
to
have
advised
tolerated
or
sanctioned
the
sacrifice
for
me
the
vedas
are
divine
and
unwritten
letter
killeth
it
is
the
spirit
that
giveth
the
light
and
the
spirit
of
the
vedas
is
purity
truth
innocence
chastity
humility
simplicity
forgiveness
godliness
and
all
that
makes
a
man
or
woman
noble
and
brave
there
is
neither
nobility
nor
bravery
in
treating
the
great
and
uncomplaining
scavengers
of
the
nation
as
worse
than
dogs
to
be
despised
and
spat
upon
would
that
god
gave
us
the
strength
and
the
wisdom
to
become
voluntary
scavengers
of
the
nation
as
the
classes
are
forced
to
be
there
are

treatment
of
indians
abroad
indians
abroad
the
prejudice
against
indian
settlers
outside
india
is
showing
itself
in
a
variety
of
ways
under
the
impudent
suggestion
of
sedition
the
fiji
government
has
deported
manilal
doctor
who
with
his
brave
and
cultured
wife
has
been
rendering
assistance
to
the
poor
indentured
indians
of
fiji
in
a
variety
of
ways
the
whole
trouble
has
arisen
over
the
strike
of
the
labourers
in
fiji
indentures
have
been
canceled
but
the
spirit
of
slavery
is
by
no
means
dead
we
do
not
know
the
genesis
of
the
strike
we
do
not
know
that
the
strikers
have
done
no
wrong
but
we
do
know
what
is
behind
when
a
charge
of
sedition
is
brought
against
the
strikers
and
their
friends
the
readers
must
remember
that
the
government
that
has
scented
sedition
in
the
recent
upheaval
in
fiji
is
the
government
that
had
the
hardihood
to
libel
andrew
character
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
sedition
in
connection
with
the
fiji
strikers
and
manilal
doctor
did
they
and
he
want
to
seize
the
reins
of
government
did
they
want
any
power
in
that
country
they
struck
for
elementary
freedom
and
it
is
a
prostitution
of
terms
to
use
the
word
sedition
in
such
connection
the
strikers
may
have
been
overhasty
manilal
doctor
may
have
misled
them
if
his
advice
bordered
on
the
criminal
he
should
have
been
tried
the
information
in
our
possession
goes
to
show
that
he
has
been
strictly
constitutional
our
point
however
is
that
it
is
an
abuse
of
power
for
the
fiji
government
to
have
deported
manilal
doctor
without
a
trial
it
is
wrong
in
principle
to
deprive
a
person
of
his
liberty
on
mere
suspicion
and
without
giving
him
an
opportunity
of
clearing
his
character
manilal
doctor
be
it
remembered
has
for
years
past
made
fiji
his
home
he
has
we
believe
bought
property
there
he
has
children
born
in
fiji
have
the
children
no
rights
has
the
wife
none
may
a
promising
career
be
ruined
at
the
bidding
of
a
lawless
government
has
manilal
doctor
been
compensated
for
the
losses
he
must
sustain
we
trust
that
the
government
of
india
which
has
endeavoured
to
protect
the
rights
of
indian
settlers
abroad
will
take
up
the
question
of
mr
doctor
deportation
nor
is
fiji
the
only
place
where
the
spirit
of
lawlessness
among
the
powerful
has
come
to
the
surface
indians
of
the
late
german
east
africa
find
themselves
in
a
worse
position
than
heretofore
they
state
that
even
their
property
is
not
safe
they
have
to
pay
all
kinds
of
dues
on
passports
they
are
hampered
in
their
trade
they
are
not
able
even
to
send
money
orders
in
british
east
africa
the
cloud
is
perhaps
the
thickest
the
european
settlers
there
are
doing
their
utmost
to
deprive
the
indian
settlers
of
practically
every
right
they
have
hitherto
possessed
an
attempt
is
being
made
to
compass
their
ruin
both
by
legislative
enactment
and
administrative
action
in
south
africa
every
indian
who
has
anything
to
do
with
that
part
of
the
british
dominions
is
watching
with
bated
breath
the
progress
of
commission
that
is
now
sitting
the
government
of
india
have
no
easy
job
in
protecting
the
interests
of
indian
settlers
in
these
various
parts
of
his
majesty
dominions
they
will
be
able
to
do
so
only
by
following
the
firmest
and
the
most
consistent
policy
justice
is
admittedly
on
the
side
of
the
indian
settlers
but
they
are
the
weak
party
a
strong
agitation
in
india
followed
by
strong
action
by
the
government
of
india
can
alone
save
the
situation
indians
overseas
the
meeting
held
at
the
excelsior
theatre
in
bombay
to
pass
resolutions
regarding
east
africa
and
fiji
and
presided
over
by
sir
narayan
chandavarkar
was
an
impressive
gathering
the
theatre
was
filled
to
overflowing
andrews
speech
made
clear
what
is
needed
both
the
political
and
the
civil
rights
of
indians
of
east
africa
are
at
stake
anantani
himself
an
east
african
settler
showed
in
a
forceful
speech
that
the
indians
were
the
pioneer
settlers
an
indian
sailor
named
kano
directed
the
celebrated
vasco
de
gama
to
india
he
added
amid
applause
that
stanley
expedition
for
the
search
and
relief
of
livingstone
was
also
fitted
out
by
indians
indian
workmen
had
built
the
uganda
railway
at
much
peril
to
their
lives
an
indian
contractor
had
taken
the
contract
indian
artisans
had
supplied
the
skill
and
now
their
countrymen
were
in
danger
of
being
debarred
from
its
use
the
uplands
of
east
africa
have
been
declared
a
colony
and
the
lowlands
a
protectorate
there
is
a
sinister
significance
attached
to
the
declaration
the
colonial
system
gives
the
europeans
larger
powers
it
will
tax
all
the
resources
of
the
government
of
india
to
prevent
the
healthy
uplands
from
becoming
a
whiteman
preserve
and
the
indians
from
being
relegated
to
the
swampy
lowlands
the
question
of
franchise
will
soon
become
a
burning
one
it
will
be
suicidal
to
divide
the
electorate
or
to
appoint
indians
by
nomination
there
must
be
one
general
electoral
roll
applying
the
same
qualifications
to
all
the
voters
this
principle
as
andrews
reminded
the
meeting
had
worked
well
at
the
cape
the
second
part
of
the
east
african
resolution
shows
the
condition
of
our
countrymen
in
the
late
german
east
africa
indian
soldiers
fought
there
and
now
the
position
of
indians
is
worse
than
under
german
rule
the
agakhan
suggested
that
german
east
africa
should
be
administered
from
india
sir
theodore
morison
would
have
couped
up
all
indians
in
german
east
africa
the
result
was
that
both
the
proposals
went
by
the
board
and
the
expected
has
happened
the
greed
of
the
english
speculator
has
prevailed
and
he
is
trying
to
squeeze
out
the
indian
what
will
the
government
of

protect

jehangir
petit
recalled
the
late
gokhale
views
that
we
were
not
to
expect
a
full
satisfaction
regarding
the
status
of
our
countrymen
across
the
seas
until
we
had
put
our
own
house
in
order
helots
in
our
own
country
how
could
we
do
better
outside
petit
wants
systematic
and
severe
retaliation
in
my
opinion
retaliation
is
a
weapon
it
does
not
fail
to
hurt
the
user
if
it
also
hurts
the
party
against
whom
it
is
used
and
who
is
to
give
effect
to
retaliation
it
is
too
much
to
expect
an
english
government
to
adopt
effective
retaliation
against
their
own
people
they
will
expostulate
they
will
remonstrate
but
they
will
not
go
to
war
with
their
own
colonies
for
the
logical
outcome
of
retaliation
must
mean
war
if
retaliation
will
not
answer
let
us
face
the
facts
frankly
the
problem
is
difficult
alike
for
englishmen
and
for
us
the
englishmen
and
indians
do
not
agree
in
the
colonies
the
englishmen
do
not
want
us
where
they
can
live
their
civilisation
is
different
from
ours
the
two
can
not
coalesce
until
there
is
mutual
respect
the
englishman
considers
himself
to
belong
to
the
ruling
race
the
indian
struggles
to
think
that
he
does
not
belong
to
the
subject
race
and
in
the
very
act
of
thinking
admits
his
subjection
we
must
then
attain
equality
at
home
before
we
can
make
any
real
impression
abroad
this
is
not
to
say
that
we
must
not
strive
to
do
better
abroad
whilst
we
are
ill
at
ease
in
our
own
home
we
must
preserve
we
must
help
our
countrymen
who
have
settled
outside
india
only
if
we
recognise
the
true
situation
we
and
our
countrymen
abroad
will
learn
to
be
patient
and
know
that
our
chief
energy
must
be
concentrated
on
a
betterment
of
our
position
at
home
if
we
can
raise
our
status
here
to
that
of
equal
partners
not
in
name
but
in
reality
so
that
every
indian
might
feel
it
all
else
must
follow
as
a
matter
of
course
pariahs
of
the
empire
the
memorable
conference
at
gujrat
in
its
resolution
on
the
status
of
indians
abroad
has
given
it
as
its
opinion
that
even
this
question
may
become
one
more
reason
for
and
so
it
may
nowhere
has
there
been
such
open
defiance
of
every
canon
of
justice
and
propriety
as
in
the
shameless
decision
of
confiscation
of
indian
rights
in
the
kenia
colony
announced
by
its
governor
this
decision
has
been
supported
by
lord
milnor
and
montagu
and
his
indian
colleagues
are
satisfied
with
the
decision
indians
who
have
made
east
africa
who
the
english
are
deprived
practically
of
the
right
of
representation
on
the
council
they
are
to
be
segregated
in
parts
not
habitable
by
the
english
they
are
to
have
neither
the
political
nor
the
material
comfort
they
are
to
become
in
a
country
made
by
their
own
labour
wealth
and
intelligence
the
viceroy
is
pleased
to
say
that
he
does
not
like
the
outlook
and
is
considering
the
steps
to
be
taken
to
vindicate
the
justice
he
is
not
met
with
a
new
situation
the
indians
of
east
africa
had
warned
him
of
the
impending
doom
and
if
his
excellency
has
not
yet
found
the
means
of
ensuring
redress
he
is
not
likely
to
do
it
in
future
i
would
respectfully
ask
his
indian
colleagues
whether
they
can
stand
this
robbery
of
their
countrymen
rights
in
south
africa
the
situation
is
not
less
disquieting
my
misgivings
seem
to
be
proving
true
and
repatriation
is
more
likely
to
prove
compulsory
than
voluntary
it
is
a
response
to
the
agitation
not
a
measure
of
relief
for
indigent
indians
it
looks
very
like
a
trap
laid
for
the
unwary
indian
the
union
government
appears
to
be
taking
an
unlawful
advantage
of
a
section
of
a
relieving
law
designed
for
a
purpose
totally
different
from
the
one
now
intended
as
for
fiji
the
crime
against
humanity
is
evidently
to
be
hushed
up
i
do
hope
that
unless
an
inquiry
is
to
be
made
into
the
fiji
martial
law
doings
no
indian
member
will
undertake
to
go
to
fiji
the
government
of
india
appear
to
have
given
an
undertaking
to
send
indian
labour
to
fiji
provided
the
commission
that
was
to
proceed
there
in
order
to
investigate
the
condition
on
the
spot
returns
with
a
favourable
report
for
british
guiana
i
observe
from
the
papers
received
from
that
quarter
that
the
mission
that
came
here
is
already
declaring
that
indian
labour
will
be
forthcoming
from
india
there
seems
to
me
to
be
no
real
prospect
for
indian
enterprise
in
that
part
of
the
world
we
are
not
wanted
in
any
part
of
the
british
dominion
except
as
pariahs
to
do
the
scavenging
for
the
european
settlers
the
situation
is
clear
we
are
pariahs
in
our
own
home
we
get
only
what
government
intend
to
give
not
what
we
demand
and
have
a
right
to
we
may
get
the
crumbs
never
the
loaf
i
have
seen
large
and
tempting
crumbs
from
a
lavish
table
and
i
have
seen
the
eyes
of
our
pariahs
the
shame
of
hinduism
brightening
to
see
those
heavy
crumbs
filling
their
baskets
but
the
superior
hindu
who
is
filling
the
basket
from
a
safe
distance
knows
that
they
are
unfit
for
his
own
consumption
and
so
we
in
our
turn
may
receive
even
governorships
which
the
real
rulers
no
longer
require
or
which
they
can
not
retain
with
safety
for
their
material
interest
the
political
and
material
hold
on
india
it
is
time
we
realised
our
true
status
viii
a
writer
in
the
times
of
india
the
editor
of
that
wonderful
daily
and
besant
have
all
in
their
own
manner
condemned
conceived
in
connection
with
the
khilafat
movement
all
the
three
writings
naturally
discuss
many
side
issues
which
i
shall
omit
for
the
time
being
i
propose
to
answer
two
serious
objections
raised
by
the
writers
the
sobriety
with
which
they
are
stated
entitles
them
to
a
greater
consideration
than
if
they
had
been
given
in
violent
language
in
the
writers
think
it
would
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
avoid
violence
indeed
violence
the
times
of
india
editorial
says
has
already
commenced
in
that
ostracism
has
been
resorted
to
in
calcutta
and
delhi
now
i
fear
that
ostracism
to
a
certain
extent
is
impossible
to
avoid
i
remember
in
south
africa
in
the
initial
stages
of
the
passive
resistance
campaign
those
who
had
fallen
away
were
ostracised
ostracism
is
violent
or
peaceful
in
according
to
the
manner
in
which
it
is
practised
a
congregation
may
well
refuse
to
recite
prayers
after
a
priest
who
prizes
his
title
above
his
honour
but
the
ostracism
will
become
violent
if
the
individual
life
of
a
person
is
made
unbearable
by
insults
innuendoes
or
abuse
the
real
danger
of
violence
lies
in
the
people
resorting
to
becoming
impatient
and
revengeful
this
may
happen
if
for
instance
payment
of
taxes
is
suddenly
withdrawn
or
if
pressure
is
put
upon
soldiers
to
lay
down
their
arms
i
however
do
not
fear
any
evil
consequences
for
the
simple
reason
that
every
responsible
mahomedan
understands
that
to
be
successful
must
be
totally
unattended
with
violence
the
other
objection
raised
is
that
those
who
may
give
up
their
service
may
have
to
starve
that
is
just
a
possibility
but
a
remote
one
for
the
committee
will
certainly
make
due
provision
for
those
who
may
suddenly
find
themselves
out
of
employment
i
propose
however
to
examine
the
whole
of
the
difficult
question
much
more
fully
in
a
future
issue
and
hope
to
show
that
if
feeling
is
to
be
respected
there
is
nothing
left
but
if
the
decision
arrived
at
is
adverse
montagu
on
the
khilafat
agitation
montagu
does
not
like
the
khilafat
agitation
that
is
daily
gathering
force
in
answer
to
questions
put
in
the
house
of
commons
he
is
reported
to
have
said
that
whilst
he
acknowledged
that
i
had
rendered
distinguished
services
to
the
country
in
the
past
he
could
not
look
upon
my
present
attitude
with
equanimity
and
that
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
i
could
now
be
treated
as
leniently
as
i
was
during
the
rowlatt
act
agitation
he
added
that
he
had
every
confidence
in
the
central
and
the
local
governments
that
they
were
carefully
watching
the
movement
and
that
they
had
full
power
to
deal
with
the
situation
this
statement
of
montagu
has
been
regarded
in
some
quarters
as
a
threat
it
has
even
been
considered
to
be
a
blank
cheque
for
the
government
of
india
to
the
reign
of
terror
if
they
chose
it
is
certainly
inconsistent
with
his
desire
to
base
the
government
on
the
goodwill
of
the
people
at
the
same
time
if
the
hunter
finding
be
true
and
if
i
was
the
cause
of
the
disturbances
last
year
i
was
undoubtedly
treated
with
exceptional
leniency
i
admit
too
that
my
activity
this
year
is
fraught
with
greater
peril
to
the
empire
as
it
is
being
conducted
than
was
last
year
activity
in
itself
is
more
harmless
than
civil
disobedience
but
in
its
effect
it
is
far
more
dangerous
for
the
government
than
civil
disobedience
is
intended
so
far
to
paralyse
the
government
as
to
compel
justice
from
it
if
it
is
carried
to
the
extreme
point
it
can
bring
the
government
to
a
standstill
a
friend
who
has
been
listening
to
my
speeches
once
asked
me
whether
i
did
not
come
under
the
sedition
section
of
the
indian
penal
code
though
i
had
not
fully
considered
it
i
told
him
that
very
probably
i
did
and
that
i
could
not
plead
guilty
if
i
was
charged
under
it
for
i
must
admit
that
i
can
pretend
to
no
for
the
present
government
and
my
speeches
are
intended
to
create
such
that
the
people
might
consider
it
a
shame
to
assist
or
with
a
government
that
had
forfeited
all
title
to
confidence
respect
or
support
i
draw
no
distinction
between
the
imperial
and
the
indian
government
the
latter
has
accepted
on
the
khilafat
the
policy
imposed
upon
it
by
the
former
and
in
the
punjab
case
the
former
has
endorsed
the
policy
of
terrorism
and
emasculation
of
a
brave
people
initiated
by
the
latter
british
ministers
have
broken
their
pledged
word
and
wantonly
wounded
the
feelings
of
the
seventy
million
mussulmans
of
india
innocent
men
and
women
were
insulted
by
the
insolent
officers
of
the
punjab
government
their
wrongs
not
only
unrighted
but
the
very
officers
who
so
cruelly
subjected
them
to
barbarous
humiliation
retain
office
under
the
government
when
at
amritsar
last
year
i
pleaded
with
all
the
earnestness
i
could
command
for
with
the
government
and
for
response
to
the
wishes
expressed
in
the
royal
proclamation
i
did
so
because
i
honestly
believed
that
a
new
era
was
about
to
begin
and
that
the
old
spirit
of
fear
distrust
and
consequent
terrorism
was
about
to
give
place
to
the
new
spirit
of
respect
trust
and
i
sincerely
believed
that
the
mussalman
sentiment
would
be
placated
and
that
the
officers
that
had
misbehaved
during
the
martial
law
regime
in
the
punjab
would
be
at
least
dismissed
and
the
people
would
be
otherwise
made
to
feel
that
a
government
that
had
always
been
found
quick
and
rightly
to
punish
popular
excesses
would
not
fail
to
punish
its
agents
misdeeds
but
to
my
amazement
and
dismay
i
have
discovered
that
the
present
representatives
of
the
empire
have
become
dishonest
and
unscrupulous
they
have
no
real
regard
for
the
wishes
of
the
people
of
india
and
they
count
indian
honour
as
of
little
consequence
i
can
no
longer
retain
affection
for
a
government
so
evilly
manned
as
it
is
and
for
me
it
is
humiliating
to
retain
my
freedom
and
be
a
witness
to
the
continuing
wrong
montagu
however
is
certainly
right
in
threatening
me
with
deprivation
of
my
liberty
if
i
persist
in
endangering
the
existence
of
the
government
for
that
must
be
the
result
if
my
activity
bears
fruit
my
only
regret
is
that
inasmuch
as
montagu
admits
my
past
services
he
might
have
perceived
that
there
must
be
something
exceptionally
bad
in
the
government
if
a
like
me
could
no
longer
give
his
affection
to
it
it
was
simpler
to
insist
on
justice
being
done
to
the
mussulmans
and
to
the
punjab
than
to
threaten
me
with
punishment
so
that
the
injustice
might
be
perpetuated
indeed
i
fully
expect
it
will
be
found
that
even
in
promoting
disaffection
towards
an
unjust
government
i
have
rendered
greater
services
to
the
empire
than
i
am
already
credited
with
at
the
present
moment
however
the
duty
of
those
who
approve
of
my
activity
is
clear
they
ought
on
no
account
to
resent
the
deprivation
of
my
liberty
should
the
government
of
india
deem
it
to
be
their
duty
to
take
it
away
a
citizen
has
no
right
to
resist
such
restriction
imposed
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
state
to
which
he
belongs
much
less
have
those
who
sympathize
with
him
in
my
case
there
can
be
no
question
of
sympathy
for
i
deliberately
oppose
the
government
to
the
extent
of
trying
to
put
its
very
existence
in
jeopardy
for
my
supporters
therefore
it
must
be
a
moment
of
joy
when
i
am
imprisoned
it
means
the
beginning
of
success
if
only
the
supporters
continue
the
policy
for
which
i
stand
if
the
government
arrest
me
they
would
do
so
in
order
to
stop
the
progress
of
which
i
preach
it
follows
that
if
continues
with
unabated
vigour
even
after
my
arrest
the
government
must
imprison
others
or
grant
the
people
wish
in
order
to
gain
their
any
eruption
of
violence
on
the
part
of
the
people
even
under
provocation
would
end
in
disaster
whether
therefore
it
is
i
or
any
one
else
who
is
arrested
during
the
campaign
the
first
condition
of
success
is
that
there
must
be
no
resentment
shown
against
it
we
can
not
imperil
the
very
existence
of
a
government
and
quarrel
with
its
attempt
to
save
itself
by
punishing
those
who
place
it
in
danger
at
the
call
of
the
country
sapru
delivered
before
the
khilafat
conference
at
allahabad
an
impassioned
address
sympathising
with
the
mussulmans
in
their
trouble
but
dissuaded
them
from
embarking
on
he
was
frankly
unable
to
suggest
a
substitute
but
was
emphatically
of
opinion
that
whether
there
was
a
substitute
or
not
was
a
remedy
worse
than
the
disease
he
said
further
that
mussulmans
will
be
taking
upon
their
shoulders
a
serious
responsibility
if
whilst
they
appealed
to
the
ignorant
masses
to
join
them
they
could
not
appeal
to
the
indian
judges
to
resign
and
if
they
did
they
would
not
succeed
i
acknowledge
the
force
of
sapru
last
argument
at
the
back
of
sapru
mind
is
the
fear
that
by
the
ignorant
people
would
lead
to
distress
and
chaos
and
would
do
no
good
in
my
opinion
any
is
bound
to
do
some
good
even
the
viceragal
saying
sir
i
can
serve
the
government
no
longer
because
it
has
hurt
my
national
honour
and
resigning
is
a
step
mightier
and
more
effective
than
the
mightiest
speech
declaiming
against
the
government
for
its
injustice
nevertheless
it
would
be
wrong
to
appeal
to
the
until
one
has
appealed
to
the
highest
in
the
land
and
as
i
propose
if
the
necessity
arose
to
ask
the
of
the
government
to
dissociate
themselves
from
an
unjust
government
i
propose
now
to
address
an
appeal
to
the
judges
and
the
executive
councillors
to
join
the
protest
that
is
rising
from
all
over
india
against
the
double
wrong
done
to
india
on
the
khilafat
and
the
punjab
question
in
both
national
honour
is
involved
i
take
it
that
these
gentlemen
have
entered
upon
their
high
offices
not
for
the
sake
of
emolument
nor
i
hope
for
the
sake
of
fame
but
for
the
sake
of
serving
their
country
it
was
not
for
money
for
they
were
earning
more
than
they
do
now
it
must
not
be
for
fame
for
they
can
not
buy
fame
at
the
cost
of
national
honour
the
only
consideration
that
can
at
the
present
moment
keep
them
in
office
must
be
service
of
the
country
when
the
people
have
faith
in
the
government
when
it
represents
the
popular
will
the
judges
and
the
executive
officials
possibly
serve
the
country
but
when
that
government
does
not
represent
the
will
of
the
people
when
it
supports
dishonesty
and
terrorism
the
judges
and
the
executive
officials
by
retaining
office
become
instrument
of
dishonesty
and
terrorism
and
the
least
therefore
that
these
holders
of
high
offices
can
do
is
to
cease
to
become
agents
of
a
dishonest
and
terrorising
government
for
the
judges
the
objection
will
be
raised
that
they
are
above
politics
and
so
they
are
and
should
be
but
the
doctrine
is
true
only
in
so
far
as
the
government
is
on
the
whole
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
and
at
least
represents
the
will
of
the
majority
not
to
take
part
in
politics
means
not
to
take
sides
but
when
a
whole
country
has
one
mind
one
will
when
a
whole
country
has
been
denied
justice
it
is
no
longer
a
question
of
party
politics
it
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
it
then
becomes
the
duty
of
every
citizen
to
refuse
to
serve
a
government
which
misbehaves
and
flouts
national
wish
the
judges
are
at
that
moment
bound
to
follow
the
nation
if
they
are
ultimately
its
servants
there
remains
another
argument
to
be
examined
it
applies
to
both
the
judges
and
the
members
of
the
executive
it
will
be
urged
that
my
appeal
could
only
be
meant
for
the
indians
and
what
good
can
it
do
by
indians
renouncing
offices
which
have
been
won
for
the
nation
by
hard
struggle
i
wish
that
i
could
make
an
effective
appeal
to
the
english
as
well
as
the
indians
but
i
confess
that
i
have
written
with
the
mental
reservation
that
the
appeal
is
addressed
only
to
the
indians
i
must
therefore
examine
the
argument
just
stated
whilst
it
is
true
that
these
offices
have
been
secured
after
a
prolonged
struggle
they
are
of
use
not
because
of
the
struggle
but
because
they
are
intended
to
serve
the
nation
the
moment
they
cease
to
possess
that
quality
they
become
useless
and
as
in
the
present
case
harmful
no
matter
how
and
therefore
valuable
they
may
have
been
at
the
outset
i
would
submit
too
to
our
distinguished
countrymen
who
occupy
high
offices
that
their
giving
up
will
bring
the
struggle
to
a
speedy
end
and
would
probably
obviate
the
danger
attendant
upon
the
masses
being
called
upon
to
signify
their
disapproval
by
withdrawing
if
the
titleholders
gave
up
their
titles
if
the
holders
of
honorary
offices
gave
up
their
appointment
and
if
the
high
officials
gave
up
their
posts
and
the
councillors
boycotted
the
councils
the
government
would
quickly
come
to
its
senses
and
give
effect
to
the
people
will
for
the
alternative
before
the
government
then
would
be
nothing
but
despotic
rule
pure
and
simple
that
would
probably
mean
military
dictatorship
the
world
opinion
has
advanced
so
far
that
britain
dare
not
contemplate
such
dictatorship
with
equanimity
the
taking
of
the
steps
suggested
by
me
will
constitute
the
peacefullest
revolution
the
world
has
ever
seen
once
the
infallibility
of
is
realised
there
is
an
end
to
all
bloodshed
and
violence
in
any
shape
or
form
undoubtedly
a
cause
must
be
grave
to
warrant
the
drastic
method
of
national
i
do
say
that
the
affront
such
as
has
been
put
upon
islam
can
not
be
repeated
for
a
century
islam
must
rise
now
or
fallen
if
not
for
ever
certainly
for
a
century
and
i
can
not
imagine
a
graver
wrong
than
the
massacre
of
jallianwalla
and
the
barbarity
that
followed
it
the
whitewash
by
the
hunter
committee
the
dispatch
of
the
government
of
india
montagu
letter
upholding
the
viceroy
and
the
then
lieutenant
governor
of
the
punjab
the
refusal
to
remove
officials
who
made
of
the
lives
of
the
punjabis
hell
during
the
martial
law
period
these
act
constitute
a
complete
series
of
continuing
wrongs
against
india
which
if
india
has
any
sense
of
honour
she
must
right
at
the
sacrifice
of
all
the
material
wealth
she
possesses
if
she
does
not
she
will
have
bartered
her
soul
for
a
of
pottage
explained
a
representative
of
madras
mail
called
on
gandhi
at
his
temporary
residence
in
the
pursewalkam
high
road
for
an
interview
on
the
subject
of
gandhi
who
has
come
to
madras
on
a
tour
to
some
of
the
principal
muslim
centres
in
southern
india
was
busy
with
a
number
of
workers
discussing
his
programme
but
he
expressed
his
readiness
to
answer
questions
on
the
chief
topic
which
is
agitating
muslims
and
hindus
after
your
experience
of
the
satyagraha
agitation
last
year
gandhi
are
you
still
hopeful
and
convinced
of
the
wisdom
of
advising
certainly
how
do
you
consider
conditions
have
altered
since
the
satyagraha
movement
of
last
year
i
consider
that
people
are
better
disciplined
now
than
they
were
before
in
this
i
include
even
the
masses
who
i
have
had
opportunities
of
seeing
in
large
numbers
in
various
parts
of
the
country
and
you
are
satisfied
that
the
masses
understand
the
spirit
of
satyagraha
yes
and
that
is
why
you
are
pressing
on
with
the
programme
of
yes
moreover
the
danger
that
attended
the
civil
disobedience
part
of
satyagraha
does
not
apply
to
because
in
we
are
not
taking
up
civil
disobedience
of
laws
as
a
mass
movement
the
result
hitherto
has
been
most
encouraging
for
instance
people
in
sindh
and
delhi
in
spite
of
the
irritating
restrictions
upon
their
liberty
by
the
authorities
have
carried
out
the
committee
instructions
in
regard
to
the
seditious
meetings
proclamation
and
to
the
prohibition
of
posting
placards
on
the
walls
which
we
hold
to
be
inoffensive
but
which
the
authorities
consider
to
be
offensive
what
is
the
pressure
which
you
expect
to
bring
to
bear
on
the
authorities
if
is
withdrawn
i
believe
and
everybody
must
grant
that
no
government
can
exist
for
a
single
moment
without
the
of
the
people
willing
or
forced
and
if
people
suddenly
withdraw
their
in
every
detail
the
government
will
come
to
a
but
is
there
not
a
big
in
it
certainly
there
is
and
how
do
you
propose
to
succeed
against
the
big
in
my
plan
of
campaign
expediency
has
no
room
if
the
khilafat
movement
has
really
permeated
the
masses
and
the
classes
there
must
be
adequate
response
from
the
people
but
are
you
not
begging
the
question
i
am
not
begging
the
question
because
so
far
as
the
data
before
me
go
i
believe
that
the
muslims
keenly
feel
the
khilafat
grievance
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
their
feeling
is
intense
enough
to
evoke
in
them
the
measure
of
sacrifice
adequate
for
successful
that
is
your
survey
of
the
conditions
you
think
justifies
your
advising
in
the
full
conviction
that
you
have
behind
you
the
support
of
the
vast
masses
of
the
mussalman
population
yes
this
you
are
satisfied
will
extend
to
complete
severance
of
with
the
government
no
nor
is
it
at
the
present
moment
my
desire
that
it
should
i
am
simply
practising
to
the
extent
that
is
necessary
to
make
the
government
realise
the
depth
of
popular
feeling
in
the
matter
and
the
dissatisfaction
with
the
government
that
all
that
could
be
done
has
not
been
done
either
by
the
government
of
india
or
by
the
imperial
government
whether
on
the
khilafat
question
or
on
the
punjab
question
do
you
gandhi
realise
that
even
amongst
mahomedans
there
are
sections
of
people
who
are
not
enthusiastic
over
however
much
they
may
feel
the
wrong
that
has
been
done
to
their
community
yes
but
their
number
is
smaller
than
those
who
are
prepared
to
adopt
and
yet
does
not
the
fact
that
there
has
not
been
an
adequate
response
to
your
appeal
for
resignation
of
titles
and
offices
and
for
boycott
of
elections
of
the
councils
indicate
that
you
may
be
placing
more
faith
in
their
strength
of
conviction
than
is
warranted
i
think
not
for
the
reason
that
the
stage
has
only
just
come
into
operation
and
our
people
are
always
most
cautious
and
slow
to
move
moreover
the
first
stage
largely
affects
the
uppermost
strata
of
society
who
represent
a
microscopic
minority
though
they
are
undoubtedly
an
influential
body
of
people
this
upper
class
you
think
has
sufficiently
responded
to
your
appeal
i
am
unable
to
say
either
one
way
or
the
other
at
present
i
shall
be
able
to
give
a
definite
answer
at
the
end
of
this
do
you
think
that
without
one
loyalty
to
the
king
and
the
royal
family
being
questioned
one
can
advocate
in
connection
with
the
royal
visit
most
decidedly
for
the
simple
reason
that
if
there
is
any
disloyalty
about
the
proposed
boycott
of
the
visit
it
is
disloyalty
to
the
government
of
the
day
and
not
to
the
person
of
his
royal
highness
what
do
you
think
is
to
be
gained
by
promoting
this
boycott
in
connection
with
the
royal
visit
because
i
want
to
show
that
the
people
of
india
are
not
in
sympathy
with
the
government
of
the
day
and
that
they
strongly
disapprove
of
the
policy
of
the
government
in
regard
to
the
punjab
and
khilafat
and
even
in
respect
of
other
important
administrative
measures
i
consider
that
the
visit
of
the
prince
of
wales
is
a
singularly
good
opportunity
to
the
people
to
show
their
disapproval
of
the
present
government
after
all
the
visit
is
calculated
to
have
tremendous
political
results
it
is
not
to
be
a
event
and
seeing
that
the
government
of
india
and
the
imperial
government
want
to
make
the
visit
a
political
event
of
first
class
importance
namely
for
the
purpose
of
strengthening
their
hold
upon
india
i
for
one
consider
that
it
is
the
bounden
duty
of
the
people
to
boycott
the
visit
which
is
being
engineered
by
the
two
governments
in
their
own
interest
which
at
the
present
moment
is
totally
antagonistic
to
the
people
do
you
mean
that
you
want
this
boycott
promoted
because
you
feel
that
the
strengthening
of
the
hold
upon
india
is
not
desirable
in
the
best
interests
of
the
country
yes
the
strengthening
of
the
hold
of
a
government
so
wicked
as
the
present
one
is
not
desirable
for
the
best
interests
of
the
people
not
that
i
want
the
bond
between
england
and
india
to
become
loosened
for
the
sake
of
loosening
it
but
i
want
that
bond
to
become
strengthened
only
in
so
far
as
it
adds
to
the
welfare
of
india
do
you
think
that
and
the
of
the
legislative
councils
consistent
no
because
a
person
who
takes
up
the
programme
of
can
not
consistently
stand
for
councils
is
in
your
opinion
an
end
in
itself
or
a
means
to
an
end
and
if
so
what
is
the
end
it
is
a
means
to
an
end
the
end
being
to
make
the
present
government
just
whereas
it
has
become
mostly
unjust
with
a
just
government
is
a
duty
with
an
unjust
government
is
equally
a
duty
will
you
look
with
favour
upon
the
proposal
to
enter
the
councils
and
to
carry
on
either
obstructive
tactics
or
to
decline
to
take
the
oath
of
allegiance
consistent
with
your
no
as
an
accurate
student
of
i
consider
that
such
a
proposal
is
inconsistent
with
the
true
spirit
of
i
have
often
said
that
a
government
really
thrives
on
obstruction
and
so
far
as
the
proposal
not
to
take
the
oath
of
allegiance
is
concerned
i
can
really
see
no
meaning
in
it
it
amounts
to
a
useless
waste
of
valuable
time
and
money
in
other
words
obstruction
is
no
stage
in
no
are
you
satisfied
that
all
efforts
at
constitutional
agitation
have
been
exhausted
and
that
is
the
only
course
left
us
i
do
not
consider
to
be
unconstitutional
remedies
now
left
open
to
us
is
the
only
one
left
for
us
do
you
consider
it
constitutional
to
adopt
it
with
a
view
merely
to
paralyse
government
certainly
it
is
not
unconstitutional
but
a
prudent
man
will
not
take
all
the
steps
that
are
constitutional
if
they
are
otherwise
undesirable
nor
do
i
advise
that
course
i
am
resorting
to
in
progressive
stages
because
i
want
to
evolve
true
order
out
of
untrue
order
i
am
not
going
to
take
a
single
step
in
unless
i
am
satisfied
that
the
country
is
ready
for
that
step
namely
will
not
be
followed
by
anarchy
or
disorder
how
will
you
satisfy
yourself
anarchy
will
not
follow
for
instance
if
i
advise
the
police
to
lay
down
their
arms
i
shall
have
satisfied
myself
that
we
are
able
by
voluntary
assistance
to
protect
ourselves
against
thieves
and
robbers
that
was
precisely
what
was
done
in
lahore
and
amritsar
last
year
by
the
citizens
by
means
of
volunteers
when
the
military
and
the
police
had
withdrawn
even
where
government
had
not
taken
such
measures
in
a
place
for
want
of
adequate
force
i
know
people
have
successfully
protected
themselves
you
have
advised
lawyers
to
by
suspending
their
practice
what
is
your
experience
has
the
lawyers
response
to
your
appeal
encouraged
you
to
hope
that
you
will
be
able
to
carry
through
all
stages
of
with
the
help
of
such
people
i
can
not
say
that
a
large
number
has
yet
responded
to
my
appeal
it
is
too
early
to
say
how
many
will
respond
but
i
may
say
that
i
do
not
rely
merely
upon
the
lawyer
class
or
highly
educated
men
to
enable
the
committee
to
carry
out
all
the
stages
of
my
hope
lies
more
with
the
masses
so
far
as
the
later
stages
of
are
concerned
religious
authority
for
it
is
not
without
the
greatest
reluctance
that
i
engage
in
a
controversy
with
so
learned
a
leader
like
sir
narayan
chandavarkar
but
in
view
of
the
fact
that
i
am
the
author
of
the
movement
of
it
becomes
my
painful
duty
to
state
my
views
even
though
they
are
opposed
to
those
of
the
leaders
whom
i
look
upon
with
respect
i
have
just
read
during
my
travels
in
malabar
sir
narayan
rejoinder
to
my
answer
to
the
bombay
manifesto
against
i
regret
to
have
to
say
that
the
rejoinder
leaves
me
unconvinced
he
and
i
seem
to
read
the
teachings
of
the
bible
the
gita
and
the
koran
from
different
standpoints
or
we
put
different
interpretations
on
them
we
seem
to
understand
the
words
ahimsa
politics
and
religion
differently
i
shall
try
my
best
to
make
clear
my
meaning
of
the
common
terms
and
my
reading
of
the
different
religious
at
the
outset
let
me
assure
sir
narayan
that
i
have
not
changed
my
views
on
ahimsa
i
still
believe
that
man
not
having
been
given
the
power
of
creation
does
not
possess
the
right
of
destroying
the
meanest
creature
that
lives
the
prerogative
of
destruction
belongs
solely
to
the
creator
of
all
that
lives
i
accept
the
interpretation
of
ahimsa
namely
that
it
is
not
merely
a
negative
state
of
harmlessness
but
it
is
a
positive
state
of
love
of
doing
good
even
to
the
but
it
does
not
mean
helping
the
to
continue
the
wrong
or
tolerating
it
by
passive
acquiescence
on
the
contrary
love
the
active
state
of
ahimsa
requires
you
to
resist
the
by
dissociating
yourself
from
him
even
though
it
may
offend
him
or
injure
him
physically
thus
if
my
son
lives
a
life
of
shame
i
may
not
help
him
to
do
so
by
continuing
to
support
him
on
the
contrary
my
love
for
him
requires
me
to
withdraw
all
support
from
him
although
it
may
mean
even
his
death
and
the
same
love
imposes
on
me
the
obligation
of
welcoming
him
to
my
bosom
when
he
repents
but
i
may
not
by
physical
force
compel
my
son
to
become
good
that
in
my
opinion
is
the
moral
of
the
story
of
the
prodigal
son
is
not
a
passive
state
it
is
an
intensely
active
state
more
active
than
physical
resistance
or
violence
passive
resistance
is
a
misnomer
in
the
sense
used
by
me
must
be
and
therefore
neither
punitive
nor
vindictive
nor
based
on
malice
or
hatred
it
follows
therefore
that
it
would
be
sin
for
me
to
serve
general
dyer
and
with
him
to
shoot
innocent
men
but
it
will
be
an
exercise
of
forgiveness
or
love
for
me
to
nurse
him
back
to
life
if
he
was
suffering
from
a
physical
malady
i
can
not
use
in
this
context
the
word
as
sir
narayan
would
perhaps
use
it
i
would
a
thousand
times
with
this
government
to
wean
it
from
its
career
of
crime
but
i
will
not
for
a
single
moment
with
it
to
continue
that
career
and
i
would
be
guilty
of
wrong
doing
if
i
retained
a
title
from
it
or
a
service
under
it
or
supported
its
or
schools
better
for
me
a
beggar
bowl
than
the
richest
possession
from
hands
stained
with
the
blood
of
the
innocents
of
jallianwala
better
by
far
a
warrant
of
imprisonment
than
honeyed
words
from
those
who
have
wantonly
wounded
the
religious
sentiment
of
my
seventy
million
brothers
my
reading
of
the
gita
is
diametrically
opposed
to
sir
narayan
i
do
not
believe
that
the
gita
teaches
violence
for
doing
good
it
is
a
description
of
the
duel
that
goes
on
in
our
own
hearts
the
divine
author
has
used
a
historical
incident
for
inculcating
the
lesson
of
doing
one
duty
even
at
the
peril
of
one
life
it
inculcates
performance
of
duty
irrespective
of
the
consequences
for
we
mortals
limited
by
our
physical
frames
are
incapable
of
controlling
actions
save
our
own
the
gita
distinguishes
between
the
powers
of
light
and
darkness
and
demonstrates
their
incompatibility
jesus
in
my
humble
opinion
was
a
prince
among
politicians
he
did
render
unto
caesar
that
which
was
caesar
he
gave
the
devil
his
due
he
ever
shunned
him
and
is
reported
never
once
to
have
yielded
to
his
incantations
the
politics
of
his
time
consisted
in
securing
the
welfare
of
the
people
by
teaching
them
not
to
be
seduced
by
the
trinkets
of
the
priests
and
the
pharisees
the
latter
then
controlled
and
moulded
the
life
of
the
people
the
system
of
government
is
so
devised
as
to
affect
every
department
of
our
life
it
threatens
our
very
existence
if
therefore
we
want
to
conserve
the
welfare
of
the
nation
we
must
religiously
interest
ourselves
in
the
doing
of
the
governors
and
exert
a
moral
influence
on
them
by
insisting
on
their
obeying
the
laws
of
morality
general
dyer
did
produce
a
effect
by
an
act
of
butchery
those
who
are
engaged
in
forwarding
the
movement
of
hope
to
produce
a
moral
effect
by
a
process
of
and
it
surprises
me
that
sir
narayan
should
speak
of
general
dyer
massacre
in
the
same
breath
as
acts
of
i
have
done
my
best
to
understand
his
meaning
but
i
am
sorry
to
confess
that
i
have
failed
the
inwardness
of
i
commend
to
the
attention
of
the
readers
the
thoughtful
letter
received
from
miss
anne
marie
peterson
miss
peterson
is
a
lady
who
has
been
in
india
for
some
years
and
has
closely
followed
indian
affairs
she
is
about
the
sever
her
connection
with
her
mission
for
the
purpose
of
giving
herself
to
education
that
is
truly
national
i
have
not
given
the
letter
in
full
i
have
omitted
all
personal
references
but
her
argument
has
been
left
entirely
untouched
the
letter
was
not
meant
to
be
printed
it
was
written
just
after
my
vellore
speech
but
it
being
intrinsically
important
i
asked
the
writer
for
her
permission
which
she
gladly
gave
for
printing
it
i
publish
it
all
the
more
gladly
in
that
it
enables
me
to
show
that
the
movement
of
is
neither
nor
nor
it
is
a
struggle
between
religion
and
irreligion
powers
of
light
and
powers
of
darkness
it
is
my
firm
opinion
that
europe
represents
not
the
spirit
of
god
or
christianity
but
the
spirit
of
satan
and
satan
successes
are
the
greatest
when
he
appears
with
the
name
of
god
on
his
lips
europe
is
only
nominally
christian
in
reality
it
is
worshipping
mammon
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
pass
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
the
kingdom
thus
really
spoke
jesus
christ
his
followers
measure
their
moral
progress
by
their
material
possessions
the
very
national
anthem
of
england
is
jesus
who
asked
his
followers
to
love
their
enemies
even
as
themselves
could
not
have
sung
of
his
enemies
his
enemies
frustrate
their
knavish
tricks
the
last
book
that
wallace
wrote
set
forth
his
deliberate
conviction
that
the
much
vaunted
advance
of
science
had
added
not
an
inch
to
the
moral
stature
of
europe
the
last
war
however
has
shown
as
nothing
else
has
the
satanic
nature
of
the
civilization
that
dominates
europe
to
day
every
canon
of
public
morality
has
been
broken
by
the
victors
in
the
name
of
virtue
no
lie
has
been
considered
too
foul
to
be
uttered
the
motive
behind
every
crime
is
not
religious
or
spiritual
but
grossly
material
but
the
mussalmans
and
the
hindus
who
are
struggling
against
the
government
have
religion
and
honour
as
their
motive
even
the
cruel
assassination
which
has
just
shocked
the
country
is
reported
to
have
a
religious
motive
behind
it
it
is
certainly
necessary
to
purge
religion
of
its
excrescences
but
it
is
equally
necessary
to
expose
the
hollowness
of
moral
pretensions
on
the
part
of
those
who
prefer
material
wealth
to
moral
gain
it
is
easier
to
wean
an
ignorant
fanatic
from
his
error
than
a
confirmed
scoundrel
from
his
scoundrelism
this
however
is
no
indictment
against
individuals
or
even
nations
thousands
of
individual
europeans
are
rising
above
their
environment
i
write
of
the
tendency
in
europe
as
reflected
in
her
present
leaders
england
through
her
leaders
is
insolently
crushing
indian
religious
and
national
sentiment
under
her
heels
england
under
the
false
plea
of
is
trying
to
exploit
the
oil
fields
of
mesopotamia
which
she
is
almost
to
leave
because
she
has
probably
no
choice
france
through
her
leaders
is
lending
her
name
to
training
cannibals
as
soldiers
and
is
shamelessly
betraying
her
trust
as
a
mandatory
power
by
trying
to
kill
the
spirit
of
the
syrians
president
wilson
has
thrown
on
the
scrap
heap
his
precious
fourteen
points
it
is
this
combination
of
evil
forces
which
india
is
really
fighting
through
and
those
like
miss
peterson
whether
christian
or
european
who
feel
that
this
error
must
be
dethroned
can
exercise
the
privilege
of
doing
so
by
joining
the
movement
with
the
honour
of
islam
is
bound
up
the
safety
of
religion
itself
and
with
the
honour
of
india
is
bound
up
the
honour
of
every
nation
known
to
be
weak
a
missionary
on
the
following
letter
has
been
received
by
gandhi
from
miss
anne
marie
peterson
of
the
danish
mission
in
madras
dear
gandhi
i
can
not
thank
you
enough
for
your
kindness
and
the
way
in
which
you
received
me
and
i
feel
that
meeting
more
or
less
decided
my
future
i
have
thrown
myself
at
the
feet
of
india
at
the
same
time
i
know
that
in
christ
alone
is
my
abode
and
i
have
no
longing
and
no
desire
but
to
live
him
my
crucified
saviour
and
reveal
him
for
those
with
whom
i
come
in
contact
i
just
cling
to
his
feet
and
pray
with
tears
that
i
may
not
disgrace
him
as
we
christians
have
been
doing
by
our
behaviour
in
india
we
go
on
crucifying
christ
while
we
long
to
proclaim
the
power
of
his
resurrection
by
which
he
has
conquered
untruth
and
unrighteousness
if
we
who
bear
his
name
were
true
to
him
we
would
never
bow
ourselves
before
the
powers
of
this
world
but
we
would
always
be
on
the
side
of
the
poor
the
suffering
and
the
oppressed
but
we
are
not
and
therefore
i
feel
myself
under
obligation
and
only
to
christ
but
to
india
for
his
sake
at
this
time
of
momentous
importance
for
her
future
truly
it
matters
little
what
i
a
lonely
and
insignificant
person
may
say
or
do
what
is
my
protest
against
the
common
current
the
race
to
which
i
belong
is
taking
and
what
grieves
me
more
which
the
missionary
societies
seem
to
follow
even
if
a
respectable
number
protested
it
would
not
be
of
any
use
yet
were
i
alone
against
the
whole
world
i
must
follow
my
conscience
and
my
god
i
therefore
can
not
but
smile
when
i
see
people
saying
you
should
have
awaited
the
decision
of
the
national
congress
before
starting
the
movement
you
have
a
message
for
the
country
and
the
congress
is
the
voice
of
the
nation
its
servant
and
not
its
master
a
majority
has
no
right
simply
because
it
is
a
majority
but
we
must
try
to
win
the
majority
and
it
is
easy
to
see
that
now
that
congress
is
going
to
be
with
you
would
it
have
done
so
if
you
had
kept
quiet
and
not
lent
your
voice
to
the
feelings
of
the
people
would
the
congress
have
known
its
mind
i
think
not
i
myself
was
in
much
doubt
before
i
heard
you
but
you
convinced
me
not
that
i
can
feel
much
on
the
question
of
the
khilafat
i
can
not
i
can
see
what
service
you
are
doing
to
india
if
you
can
prevent
the
mahomedans
from
using
the
sword
in
order
to
take
revenge
and
get
their
rights
i
can
see
that
if
you
unite
the
hindus
and
the
mahomedans
it
will
be
a
master
stroke
how
i
wish
the
christian
would
also
come
forward
and
unite
with
you
for
the
sake
of
their
country
and
the
honour
not
only
of
their
motherland
but
of
christ
i
may
not
feel
much
for
turkey
but
i
feel
for
india
and
i
can
see
she
india
has
no
other
way
to
protest
against
being
trampled
down
and
crushed
than
i
also
want
you
to
know
that
many
in
denmark
and
all
over
the
world
yes
i
am
sure
every
true
christian
will
feel
with
and
be
in
sympathy
with
india
in
the
struggle
which
is
now
going
on
god
forbid
that
in
the
struggle
between
might
and
right
truth
and
untruth
the
spirit
and
the
flesh
there
should
be
a
division
of
races
there
is
not
the
same
struggle
is
going
on
all
over
the
world
what
does
it
matter
then
that
we
are
a
few
god
is
on
our
side
brute
force
often
seems
to
get
the
upper
hand
but
righteousness
always
has
and
always
shall
conquer
be
it
even
through
much
suffering
and
what
may
even
appear
to
be
a
defeat
christ
conquered
when
the
world
crucified
him
blessed
are
the
meek
they
shall
inherit
the
earth
when
i
read
your
speech
given
at
madras
it
struck
me
that
it
should
be
printed
as
a
pamphlet
in
english
tamil
hindustani
and
all
the
most
used
languages
and
then
spread
to
every
nook
and
corner
of
india
the
movement
once
started
must
be
worked
so
as
to
become
successful
if
it
is
not
i
dread
to
think
of
the
consequences
but
you
can
not
expect
it
to
win
in
a
day
or
two
it
must
take
time
and
you
will
not
despair
if
you
do
not
reach
your
goal
in
a
hurry
for
those
who
have
faith
there
is
no
haste
now
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
children
and
students
from
government
schools
i
think
it
a
most
important
step
taking
the
government
help
even
if
it
be
your
money
they
pay
you
back
we
must
submit
to
its
scheme
its
rules
and
regulation
india
and
we
who
love
her
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
education
the
foreign
government
has
given
you
is
not
healthy
for
india
and
can
certainly
never
make
for
her
real
growth
this
movement
would
lead
to
a
spontaneous
rise
of
national
schools
let
them
be
a
few
but
let
them
spring
up
through
only
by
indigenous
education
can
india
be
truly
uplifted
why
this
appeals
so
much
to
me
is
perhaps
because
i
belong
to
the
part
of
the
danish
people
who
started
their
own
independent
indigenous
national
schools
the
danish
free
schools
and
of
which
you
may
have
heard
were
started
against
the
opposition
and
persecution
of
the
state
the
organisers
won
and
thus
have
regenerated
the
nation
with
my
truly
heartfelt
thanks
and
prayers
for
you
i
am
your
sincerely
anne
marie
how
to
work
perhaps
the
best
way
of
answering
the
fears
and
criticism
as
to
is
to
elaborate
more
fully
the
scheme
of
the
critics
seem
to
imagine
that
the
organisers
propose
to
give
effect
to
the
whole
scheme
at
once
the
fact
however
is
that
the
organisers
have
fixed
definite
progressive
four
stages
the
first
is
the
giving
up
of
titles
and
resignation
of
honorary
posts
if
there
is
no
response
or
if
the
response
received
is
not
effective
recourse
will
be
had
to
the
second
stage
the
second
stage
involves
much
previous
arrangement
certainly
not
a
single
servant
will
be
called
out
unless
he
is
either
capable
of
supporting
himself
and
his
dependents
or
the
khilafat
committee
is
able
to
bear
the
burden
all
the
classes
of
servants
will
not
be
called
out
at
once
and
never
will
any
pressure
be
put
upon
a
single
servant
to
withdraw
himself
from
the
government
service
nor
will
a
single
private
employee
be
touched
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
movement
is
not
it
is
not
even
is
to
be
withdrawn
because
the
people
must
not
be
party
to
a
wrong
a
broken
pledge
a
violation
of
deep
religious
sentiment
naturally
the
movement
will
receive
a
check
if
there
is
any
undue
influence
brought
to
bear
upon
any
government
servant
or
if
any
violence
is
used
or
countenanced
by
any
member
of
the
khilafat
committee
the
second
stage
must
be
entirely
successful
if
the
response
is
at
all
on
an
adequate
scale
for
no
government
much
less
the
indian
government
can
subsist
if
the
people
cease
to
serve
it
the
withdrawal
therefore
of
the
police
and
the
military
the
third
stage
is
a
distant
goal
the
organisers
however
wanted
to
be
fair
open
and
above
suspicion
they
did
not
want
to
keep
back
from
the
government
or
the
public
a
single
step
they
had
in
contemplation
even
as
a
remote
contingency
the
fourth
suspension
of
taxes
is
still
more
remote
the
organisers
recognise
that
suspension
of
general
taxation
is
fraught
with
the
greatest
danger
it
is
likely
to
bring
a
sensitive
class
in
conflict
with
the
police
they
are
therefore
not
likely
to
embark
upon
it
unless
they
can
do
so
with
the
assurance
that
there
will
be
no
violence
offered
by
the
people
i
admit
as
i
have
already
done
that
is
not
unattended
with
risk
but
the
risk
of
supineness
in
the
face
of
a
grave
issue
is
infinitely
greater
than
the
danger
of
violence
ensuing
form
organizing
to
do
nothing
is
to
invite
violence
for
a
certainty
it
is
easy
enough
to
pass
resolutions
or
write
articles
condemning
but
it
is
no
easy
task
to
restrain
the
fury
of
a
people
incensed
by
a
deep
sense
of
wrong
i
urge
those
who
talk
or
work
against
to
descend
from
their
chairs
and
go
down
to
the
people
learn
their
feelings
and
write
if
they
have
the
heart
against
they
will
find
as
i
have
found
that
the
only
way
to
avoid
violence
is
to
enable
them
to
give
such
expression
to
their
feelings
as
to
compel
redress
i
have
found
nothing
save
it
is
logical
and
harmless
it
is
the
inherent
right
of
a
subject
to
refuse
to
assist
a
government
that
will
not
listen
to
him
as
a
voluntary
movement
can
only
succeed
if
the
feeling
is
genuine
and
strong
enough
to
make
people
suffer
to
the
utmost
if
the
religious
sentiment
of
the
mahomedans
is
deeply
hurt
and
if
the
hindus
entertain
neighbourly
regard
towards
their
muslim
brethren
they
will
both
count
no
cost
too
great
for
achieving
the
end
will
not
only
be
an
effective
remedy
but
will
also
be
an
effective
test
of
the
sincerity
of
the
muslim
claim
and
the
hindu
profession
of
friendship
there
is
however
one
formidable
argument
urged
by
friends
against
my
joining
the
khilafat
movement
they
say
that
it
me
a
friend
of
the
english
and
an
admirer
of
the
british
constitution
to
join
hands
with
those
who
are
filled
with
nothing
but
against
the
english
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
confess
that
the
ordinary
mahomedan
entertains
no
affection
for
englishmen
he
considers
not
without
some
cause
that
they
have
not
played
the
game
but
if
i
am
friendly
towards
englishmen
i
am
no
less
so
towards
my
countrymen
the
mahomedans
and
as
such
they
have
a
greater
claim
upon
my
attention
than
englishmen
my
personal
religion
however
enables
me
to
serve
my
countrymen
without
hurting
englishmen
or
for
that
matter
anybody
else
what
i
am
not
prepared
to
do
to
my
i
would
not
do
to
an
englishman
i
would
not
injure
him
to
gain
a
kingdom
but
i
would
withdraw
from
him
if
it
becomes
necessary
as
i
had
withdrawn
from
my
own
brother
now
deceased
when
it
became
necessary
i
serve
the
empire
by
refusing
to
partake
in
its
wrong
william
stead
offered
public
prayers
for
british
reverses
at
the
time
of
the
boer
war
because
he
considered
that
the
nation
to
which
he
belonged
was
engaged
in
an
unrighteous
war
the
present
prime
minister
risked
his
life
in
opposing
that
war
and
did
everything
he
could
to
obstruct
his
own
government
in
its
prosecution
and
if
i
have
thrown
in
my
lot
with
the
mahomedans
a
large
number
of
whom
bear
no
friendly
feelings
towards
the
british
i
have
done
so
frankly
as
a
friend
of
the
british
and
with
the
object
of
gaining
justice
and
of
thereby
showing
the
capacity
of
the
british
constitution
to
respond
to
every
honest
determination
when
it
is
coupled
with
suffering
i
hope
by
my
with
the
mahomedans
to
achieve
a
threefold
end
to
obtain
justice
in
the
face
of
odds
with
the
method
of
satyagrah
and
to
show
its
efficacy
over
all
other
methods
to
secure
mahomedan
friendship
for
the
hindus
and
thereby
internal
peace
also
and
last
but
not
least
to
transform
into
affection
for
the
british
and
their
constitution
which
in
spite
of
the
imperfections
weathered
many
a
storm
i
may
fail
in
achieving
any
of
the
ends
i
can
but
attempt
god
alone
can
grant
success
it
will
not
be
denied
that
the
ends
are
all
worthy
i
invite
hindus
and
englishman
to
join
me
in
a
manner
in
shouldering
the
burden
the
mahomedans
of
india
are
carrying
theirs
is
admittedly
a
just
fight
the
viceroy
the
secretary
of
state
the
maharaja
of
bikuner
and
lord
sinha
have
testified
to
it
time
has
arrived
to
make
good
the
testimony
people
with
a
just
cause
are
never
satisfied
with
a
mere
protest
they
have
been
known
to
die
for
it
are
a
people
like
the
mahomedans
expected
to
do
less
speech
at
madras
addressing
a
huge
concourse
of
people
of
the
city
of
madras
hindus
and
mahomedans
numbering
over
assembled
on
the
south
beach
opposite
to
the
presidency
college
madras
on
the
august
mahatma
gandhi
spoke
as
follows
chairman
and
friends
like
last
year
i
have
to
ask
your
forgiveness
that
i
should
have
to
speak
being
seated
whilst
my
voice
has
become
stronger
than
it
was
last
year
my
body
is
still
weak
and
if
i
were
to
attempt
to
speak
to
you
standing
i
could
not
hold
on
for
very
many
minutes
before
the
whole
frame
would
shake
i
hope
therefore
that
you
will
grant
me
permission
to
speak
seated
i
have
sat
here
to
address
you
on
a
most
important
question
probably
a
question
whose
importance
we
have
not
measured
up
to
now
lokamanya
tilak
but
before
i
approach
that
question
on
this
dear
old
beach
of
madras
you
will
expect
me
you
will
want
me
to
offer
my
tribute
to
the
great
departed
lokamanya
tilak
maharaj
loud
and
prolonged
cheers
i
would
ask
this
great
assembly
to
listen
to
me
in
silence
i
have
come
to
make
an
appeal
to
your
hearts
and
to
your
reason
and
i
could
not
do
so
unless
you
were
prepared
to
listen
to
whatever
i
have
to
say
in
absolute
silence
i
wish
to
offer
my
tribute
to
the
departed
patriot
and
i
think
that
i
can
not
do
better
than
say
that
his
death
as
his
life
has
poured
new
vigour
into
the
country
if
you
were
present
as
i
was
present
at
that
great
funeral
procession
you
would
realise
with
me
the
meaning
of
my
words
tilak
lived
for
his
country
the
inspiration
of
his
life
was
freedom
for
his
country
which
he
called
swaraj
the
inspiration
of
his
was
also
freedom
for
his
country
and
it
was
that
which
gave
him
such
marvellous
hold
upon
his
countrymen
it
was
that
which
commanded
the
adoration
not
of
a
few
chosen
indians
belonging
to
the
upper
strata
of
society
but
of
millions
of
his
countrymen
his
life
was
one
long
sustained
piece
of
he
began
that
life
of
discipline
and
in
and
he
continued
that
life
up
to
the
end
of
his
day
and
that
was
the
secret
of
his
hold
upon
his
country
he
not
only
knew
what
he
wanted
for
his
country
but
also
how
to
live
for
his
country
and
how
to
die
for
his
country
i
hope
then
that
whatever
i
say
this
evening
to
this
vast
mass
of
people
will
bear
fruit
in
that
same
sacrifice
for
which
the
life
of
lokamanya
tilak
maharaj
stands
his
life
if
it
teaches
us
anything
whatsoever
teaches
one
supreme
lesson
that
if
we
want
to
do
anything
whatsoever
for
our
country
we
can
do
so
not
by
speeches
however
grand
eloquent
and
convincing
they
may
be
but
only
by
sacrifice
at
the
back
of
every
act
of
our
life
i
have
come
to
ask
everyone
of
you
whether
you
are
ready
and
willing
to
give
sufficiently
for
your
country
sake
for
honour
and
for
religion
i
have
boundless
faith
in
you
the
citizens
of
madras
and
the
people
of
this
great
presidency
a
faith
which
i
began
to
cultivate
in
the
year
when
i
first
made
acquaintance
with
the
tamil
labourers
in
south
africa
and
i
hope
that
in
these
hours
of
our
trial
this
province
will
not
be
second
to
any
other
in
india
and
that
it
will
lead
in
this
spirit
of
and
will
translate
every
word
into
action
need
for
what
is
this
about
which
you
have
heard
so
much
and
why
do
we
want
to
offer
this
i
wish
to
go
for
the
time
being
into
the
why
here
are
two
things
before
this
country
the
first
and
the
foremost
is
the
khilafat
question
on
this
the
heart
of
the
mussalmans
of
india
has
become
lascerated
british
pledges
given
after
the
greatest
deliberation
by
the
prime
minister
of
england
in
the
name
of
the
english
nation
have
been
dragged
into
the
mire
the
promises
given
to
moslem
india
on
the
strength
of
which
the
consideration
that
was
expected
by
the
british
nation
was
exacted
have
been
broken
and
the
great
religion
of
islam
has
been
placed
in
danger
the
mussalmans
hold
and
i
venture
to
think
they
rightly
hold
that
so
long
as
british
promises
remain
unfulfilled
so
long
is
it
impossible
for
them
to
tender
fealty
and
loyalty
to
the
british
connection
and
if
it
is
to
be
a
choice
for
a
devout
mussalman
between
loyalty
to
the
british
connection
and
loyalty
to
his
code
and
prophet
he
will
not
require
a
second
to
make
his
choice
and
he
has
declared
his
choice
the
mussalmans
say
frankly
openly
and
honourably
to
the
whole
world
that
if
the
british
ministers
and
the
british
nation
do
not
fulfil
the
pledges
given
to
them
and
do
not
wish
to
regard
with
respect
the
sentiments
of
millions
of
the
inhabitants
of
india
who
profess
the
faith
of
islam
it
will
be
impossible
for
them
to
retain
islamic
loyalty
it
is
a
question
then
for
the
rest
of
the
indian
population
to
consider
whether
they
want
to
perform
a
neighbourly
duty
by
their
mussalman
countrymen
and
if
they
do
they
have
an
opportunity
of
a
lifetime
which
will
not
occur
for
another
hundred
years
to
show
their
fellowship
and
friendship
and
to
prove
what
they
have
been
saying
for
all
these
long
years
that
the
mussalman
is
the
brother
of
the
hindu
if
the
hindu
regards
that
before
the
connection
with
the
british
nation
comes
his
natural
connection
with
his
moslem
brother
then
i
say
to
you
that
if
you
find
that
the
moslem
claim
is
just
that
it
is
based
upon
real
sentiment
and
that
at
its
back
ground
is
this
great
religious
feeling
you
can
not
do
otherwise
than
help
the
mussalman
through
and
through
so
long
as
their
cause
remains
just
and
the
means
for
attaining
the
end
remains
equally
just
honourable
and
free
from
harm
to
india
these
are
the
plain
conditions
which
the
indian
mussalmans
have
accepted
and
it
was
when
they
saw
that
they
could
accept
the
proferred
aid
of
the
hindus
that
they
could
always
justify
the
cause
and
the
means
before
the
whole
world
that
they
decided
to
accept
the
proferred
hand
of
fellowship
it
is
then
for
the
hindus
and
mahomedans
to
offer
a
united
front
to
the
whole
of
the
christian
powers
of
europe
and
tell
them
that
weak
as
india
is
india
has
still
got
the
capacity
of
preserving
her
she
still
knows
how
to
die
for
her
religion
and
for
her
that
is
the
khilafat
in
a
but
you
have
also
got
the
punjab
the
punjab
has
wounded
the
heart
of
india
as
no
other
question
has
for
the
past
century
i
do
not
exclude
from
my
calculation
the
mutiny
of
whatever
hardships
india
had
to
suffer
during
the
mutiny
the
insult
that
was
attempted
to
be
offered
to
her
during
the
passage
of
the
rowlatt
legislation
and
that
which
was
offered
after
its
passage
were
unparalleled
in
indian
history
it
is
because
you
want
justice
from
the
british
nation
in
connection
with
the
punjab
atrocities
you
have
to
devise
ways
and
means
as
to
how
you
can
get
this
justice
the
house
of
commons
the
house
of
lords
montagu
the
viceroy
of
india
everyone
of
them
know
what
the
feeling
of
india
is
on
this
khilafat
question
and
on
that
of
the
punjab
the
debates
in
both
the
houses
of
parliament
the
action
of
montagu
and
that
of
the
viceroy
have
demonstrated
to
you
completely
that
they
are
not
willing
to
give
the
justice
which
is
india
due
and
which
she
demands
i
suggest
that
our
leaders
have
got
to
find
a
way
out
of
this
great
difficulty
and
unless
we
have
made
ourselves
even
with
the
british
rulers
in
india
and
unless
we
have
gained
a
measure
of
at
the
hands
of
the
british
rulers
in
india
no
connection
and
no
friendly
intercourse
is
possible
between
them
and
ourselves
i
therefore
venture
to
suggest
this
beautiful
and
unanswerable
method
of
is
it
unconstitutional
i
have
been
told
that
is
unconstitutional
i
venture
to
deny
that
it
is
unconstitutional
on
the
contrary
i
hold
that
is
a
just
and
religious
doctrine
it
is
the
inherent
right
of
every
human
being
and
it
is
perfectly
constitutional
a
great
lover
of
the
british
empire
has
said
that
under
the
british
constitution
even
a
successful
rebellion
is
perfectly
constitutional
and
he
quotes
historical
instances
which
i
can
not
deny
in
support
of
his
claim
i
do
not
claim
any
constitutionality
for
a
rebellion
successful
or
otherwise
so
long
as
that
rebellion
means
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
term
what
it
does
mean
namely
wresting
justice
by
violent
means
on
the
contrary
i
have
said
it
repeatedly
to
my
countrymen
that
violence
whatever
end
it
may
serve
in
europe
will
never
serve
us
in
india
my
brother
and
friend
shaukat
ali
believes
in
methods
of
violence
and
if
it
was
in
his
power
to
draw
the
sword
against
the
british
empire
i
know
that
he
has
got
the
courage
of
a
man
and
he
has
got
also
the
wisdom
to
see
that
he
should
offer
that
battle
to
the
british
empire
but
because
he
recognises
as
a
true
soldier
that
means
of
violence
are
not
open
to
india
he
sides
with
me
accepting
my
humble
assistance
and
pledges
his
word
that
so
long
as
i
am
with
him
and
so
long
as
he
believes
in
the
doctrine
so
long
will
he
not
harbour
even
the
idea
of
violence
against
any
single
englishman
or
any
single
man
on
earth
i
am
here
to
tell
you
that
he
has
been
as
true
as
his
word
and
has
kept
it
religiously
i
am
here
to
bear
witness
that
he
has
been
following
out
this
plan
of
to
the
very
letter
and
i
am
asking
india
to
follow
this
i
tell
you
that
there
is
not
a
better
soldier
living
in
our
ranks
in
british
india
than
shaukat
ali
when
the
time
for
the
drawing
of
the
sword
comes
if
it
ever
comes
you
will
find
him
drawing
that
sword
and
you
will
find
me
retiring
to
the
jungles
of
hindustan
as
soon
as
india
accepts
the
doctrine
of
the
sword
my
life
as
an
indian
is
finished
it
is
because
i
believe
in
a
mission
special
to
india
and
it
is
because
i
believe
that
the
ancients
of
india
after
centuries
of
experience
have
found
out
that
the
true
thing
for
any
human
being
on
earth
is
not
justice
based
on
violence
but
justice
based
on
sacrifice
of
self
justice
based
on
yagna
and
kurbani
i
cling
to
that
doctrine
and
i
shall
cling
to
it
for
ever
it
is
for
that
reason
i
tell
you
that
whilst
my
friend
believes
also
in
the
doctrine
of
violence
and
has
adopted
the
doctrine
of
as
a
weapon
of
the
weak
i
believe
in
the
doctrine
of
as
a
weapon
of
the
strongest
i
believe
that
a
man
is
the
strongest
soldier
for
daring
to
die
unarmed
with
his
breast
bare
before
the
enemy
so
much
for
the
part
of
i
therefore
venture
to
suggest
to
my
learned
countrymen
that
so
long
as
the
doctrine
of
remains
so
long
there
is
nothing
unconstitutional
in
that
doctrine
i
ask
further
is
it
unconstitutional
for
me
to
say
to
the
british
government
refuse
to
serve
you
is
it
unconstitutional
for
our
worthy
chairman
to
return
with
every
respect
all
the
titles
that
he
has
ever
held
from
the
government
is
it
unconstitutional
for
any
parent
to
withdraw
his
children
from
a
government
or
aided
school
is
it
unconstitutional
for
a
lawyer
to
say
shall
no
longer
support
the
arm
of
the
law
so
long
as
that
arm
of
law
is
used
not
to
raise
me
but
to
debase
me
is
it
unconstitutional
for
a
civil
servant
or
for
a
judge
to
say
refuse
to
serve
a
government
which
does
not
wish
to
respect
the
wishes
of
the
whole
people
i
ask
is
it
unconstitutional
for
a
policeman
or
for
a
soldier
to
tender
his
resignation
when
he
knows
that
he
is
called
to
serve
a
government
which
traduces
his
own
countrymen
is
it
unconstitutional
for
me
to
go
to
the
to
the
agriculturist
and
say
to
him
is
not
wise
for
you
to
pay
any
taxes
if
these
taxes
are
used
by
the
government
not
to
raise
you
but
to
weaken
you
i
hold
and
i
venture
to
submit
that
there
is
nothing
unconstitutional
in
it
what
is
more
i
have
done
every
one
of
these
things
in
my
life
and
nobody
has
questioned
the
constitutional
character
of
it
i
was
in
kaira
working
in
the
midst
of
lakhs
of
agriculturists
they
had
all
suspended
the
payment
of
taxes
and
the
whole
of
india
was
at
one
with
me
nobody
considered
that
it
was
unconstitutional
i
submit
that
in
the
whole
plan
of
there
is
nothing
unconstitutional
but
i
do
venture
to
suggest
that
it
will
be
highly
unconstitutional
in
the
midst
of
this
unconstitutional
government
in
the
midst
of
a
nation
which
has
built
up
its
magnificent
constitution
for
the
people
of
india
to
become
weak
and
to
crawl
on
their
belly
it
will
be
highly
unconstitutional
for
the
people
of
india
to
pocket
every
insult
that
is
offered
to
them
it
is
highly
unconstitutional
for
the
millions
of
mohamedans
of
india
to
submit
to
a
violent
wrong
done
to
their
religion
it
is
highly
unconstitutional
for
the
whole
of
india
to
sit
still
and
with
an
unjust
government
which
has
trodden
under
its
feet
the
honour
of
the
punjab
i
say
to
my
countrymen
so
long
as
you
have
a
sense
of
honour
and
so
long
as
you
wish
to
remain
the
descendants
and
defenders
of
the
noble
traditions
that
have
been
handed
to
you
for
generations
after
generations
it
is
unconstitutional
for
you
not
to
and
unconstitutional
for
you
to
with
a
government
which
has
become
so
unjust
as
our
government
has
become
i
am
not
i
am
not
i
am
not
anti
any
government
but
i
am
and
so
long
as
the
government
spells
injustice
it
may
regard
me
as
its
enemy
implacable
enemy
i
had
hoped
at
the
congress
at
amritsar
i
am
speaking
truth
before
you
when
i
pleaded
on
bended
knees
before
some
of
you
for
with
the
government
i
had
full
hope
that
the
british
ministers
who
are
wise
as
a
rule
would
placate
the
mussalman
sentiment
that
they
would
do
full
justice
in
the
matter
of
the
punjab
atrocities
and
therefore
i
said
let
us
return
to
the
hand
of
fellowship
that
has
been
extended
to
us
which
i
then
believed
was
extended
to
us
through
the
royal
proclamation
it
was
on
that
account
that
i
pleaded
for
but
that
faith
having
gone
and
obliterated
by
the
acts
of
the
british
ministers
i
am
here
to
plead
not
for
futile
obstruction
in
the
legislative
council
but
for
real
substantial
which
would
paralyse
the
mightiest
government
on
earth
that
is
what
i
stand
for
until
we
have
wrung
justice
and
until
we
have
wrung
our
from
unwilling
hands
and
from
unwilling
pens
there
can
be
no
our
shastras
say
and
i
say
so
with
the
greatest
deference
to
all
the
greatest
religious
preceptors
of
india
but
without
fear
of
contradiction
that
our
shastras
teach
us
that
there
shall
be
no
between
injustice
and
justice
between
an
unjust
man
and
a
man
between
truth
and
untruth
is
a
duty
only
so
long
as
government
protects
your
honour
and
is
an
equal
duty
when
the
government
instead
of
protecting
robs
you
of
your
honour
that
is
the
doctrine
of
and
the
special
congress
i
have
been
told
that
i
should
have
waited
for
the
declaration
of
the
special
congress
which
is
the
mouth
piece
of
the
whole
nation
i
know
that
it
is
the
mouthpiece
of
the
whole
nation
if
it
was
for
me
individual
gandhi
to
wait
i
would
have
waited
for
eternity
but
i
had
in
my
hands
a
sacred
trust
i
was
advising
my
mussalman
countrymen
and
for
the
time
being
i
hold
their
honour
in
my
hands
i
dare
not
ask
them
to
wait
for
any
verdict
but
the
verdict
of
their
own
conscience
do
you
suppose
that
mussalmans
can
eat
their
own
words
can
withdraw
from
the
honourable
position
they
have
taken
up
if
perchance
and
god
forbid
that
it
should
happen
the
special
congress
decides
against
them
i
would
still
advise
my
countrymen
the
mussalmans
to
stand
single
handed
and
fight
rather
than
yield
to
the
attempted
dishonour
to
their
religion
it
is
therefore
given
to
the
mussalmans
to
go
to
the
congress
on
bended
knees
and
plead
for
support
but
support
or
no
support
it
was
not
possible
for
them
to
wait
for
the
congress
to
give
them
the
lead
they
had
to
choose
between
futile
violence
drawing
of
the
naked
sword
and
peaceful
but
effective
and
they
have
made
their
choice
i
venture
further
to
say
to
you
that
if
there
is
any
body
of
men
who
feel
as
i
do
the
sacred
character
of
it
is
for
you
and
me
not
to
wait
for
the
congress
but
to
act
and
to
make
it
impossible
for
the
congress
to
give
any
other
verdict
after
all
what
is
the
congress
the
congress
is
the
collected
voice
of
individuals
who
form
it
and
if
the
individuals
go
to
the
congress
with
a
united
voice
that
will
be
the
verdict
you
will
gain
from
the
congress
but
if
we
go
to
the
congress
with
no
opinion
because
we
have
none
or
because
we
are
afraid
to
express
it
then
naturally
we
wait
the
verdict
of
the
congress
to
those
who
are
unable
to
make
up
their
mind
i
say
by
all
means
wait
but
for
those
who
have
seen
the
clear
light
as
they
see
the
lights
in
front
of
them
for
them
to
wait
is
a
sin
the
congress
does
not
expect
you
to
wait
but
it
expects
you
to
act
so
that
the
congress
can
gauge
properly
the
national
feeling
so
much
for
the
congress
boycott
of
the
councils
among
the
details
of
i
have
placed
in
the
foremost
rank
the
boycott
of
the
councils
friends
have
quarrelled
with
me
for
the
use
of
the
word
boycott
because
i
have
disapproved
as
i
disapprove
even
now
boycott
of
british
goods
or
any
goods
for
that
matter
but
there
boycott
has
its
own
meaning
and
here
boycott
has
its
own
meaning
i
not
only
do
not
disapprove
but
approve
of
the
boycott
of
the
councils
that
are
going
to
be
formed
next
year
and
why
do
i
do
it
the
people
the
masses
require
from
us
the
leaders
a
clear
lead
they
do
not
want
any
equivocation
from
us
the
suggestion
that
we
should
seek
election
and
then
refuse
to
take
the
oath
of
allegiance
would
only
make
the
nation
distrust
the
leaders
it
is
not
a
clear
lead
to
the
nation
so
i
say
to
you
my
countrymen
not
to
fall
into
this
trap
we
shall
sell
our
country
by
adopting
the
method
of
seeking
election
and
then
not
taking
the
oath
of
allegiance
we
may
find
it
difficult
and
i
frankly
confess
to
you
that
i
have
not
that
trust
in
so
many
indians
making
that
declaration
and
standing
by
it
i
suggest
to
those
who
honestly
hold
the
view
that
we
should
seek
election
and
then
refuse
to
take
the
oath
of
allegiance
i
suggest
to
them
that
they
will
fall
into
a
trap
which
they
are
preparing
for
themselves
and
for
the
nation
that
is
my
view
i
hold
that
if
we
want
to
give
the
nation
the
clearest
possible
lead
and
if
we
want
not
to
play
with
this
great
nation
we
must
make
it
clear
to
this
nation
that
we
can
not
take
any
favours
no
matter
how
great
they
may
be
so
long
as
those
favours
are
accompanied
by
an
injustice
a
double
wrong
done
to
india
not
yet
redressed
the
first
indispensable
thing
before
we
can
receive
any
favours
from
them
is
that
they
should
redress
this
double
wrong
there
is
a
greek
proverb
which
used
to
say
beware
of
the
greek
but
especially
beware
of
them
when
they
bring
gifts
to
you
from
those
ministers
who
are
bent
upon
perpetuating
the
wrong
to
islam
and
to
the
punjab
i
say
we
can
not
accept
gifts
but
we
should
be
doubly
careful
lest
we
may
not
fall
into
the
trap
that
they
may
have
devised
i
therefore
suggest
that
we
must
not
coquet
with
the
council
and
must
not
have
anything
whatsoever
to
do
with
them
i
am
told
that
if
we
who
represent
the
national
sentiment
do
not
seek
election
the
moderates
who
do
not
represent
that
sentiment
will
i
do
not
agree
i
do
not
know
what
the
moderates
represent
and
i
do
not
know
what
the
nationalists
represent
i
know
that
there
are
good
sheep
and
black
sheep
amongst
the
moderates
i
know
that
there
are
good
sheep
and
black
sheep
amongst
the
nationalists
i
know
that
many
moderates
hold
honestly
the
view
that
it
is
a
sin
to
resort
to
i
respectfully
agree
to
differ
from
them
i
do
say
to
them
also
that
they
will
fall
into
a
trap
which
they
will
have
devised
if
they
seek
election
but
that
does
not
affect
my
situation
if
i
feel
in
my
heart
of
hearts
that
i
ought
not
to
go
to
the
councils
i
ought
at
least
to
abide
by
this
decision
and
it
does
not
matter
if
other
countrymen
seek
election
that
is
the
only
way
in
which
public
work
can
be
done
and
public
opinion
can
be
built
that
is
the
only
way
in
which
reforms
can
be
achieved
and
religion
can
be
conserved
if
it
is
a
question
of
religious
honour
whether
i
am
one
or
among
many
i
must
stand
upon
my
doctrine
even
if
i
should
die
in
the
attempt
it
is
worth
dying
for
than
that
i
should
live
and
deny
my
own
doctrine
i
suggest
that
it
will
be
wrong
on
the
part
of
any
one
to
seek
election
to
these
councils
if
once
we
feel
that
we
can
not
with
this
government
we
have
to
commence
from
the
top
we
are
the
natural
leaders
of
the
people
and
we
have
acquired
the
right
and
the
power
to
go
to
the
nation
and
speak
to
it
with
the
voice
of
i
therefore
do
suggest
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
to
seek
election
to
the
councils
on
any
terms
whatsoever
lawyers
and
i
have
suggested
another
difficult
matter
that
the
lawyers
should
suspend
their
practice
how
should
i
do
otherwise
knowing
so
well
how
the
government
had
always
been
able
to
retain
this
power
through
the
instrumentality
of
lawyers
it
is
perfectly
true
that
it
is
the
lawyers
of
who
are
leading
us
who
are
fighting
the
country
battles
but
when
it
comes
to
a
matter
of
action
against
the
government
when
it
comes
to
a
matter
of
paralysing
the
activity
of
the
government
i
know
that
the
government
always
look
to
the
lawyers
however
fine
fighters
they
may
have
been
to
preserve
their
dignity
and
their
i
therefore
suggest
to
my
lawyer
friends
that
it
is
their
duty
to
suspend
their
practice
and
to
show
to
the
government
that
they
will
no
longer
retain
their
offices
because
lawyers
are
considered
to
be
honorary
officers
of
the
courts
and
therefore
subject
to
their
disciplinary
jurisdiction
they
must
no
longer
retain
these
honorary
offices
if
they
want
to
withdraw
on
operation
from
government
but
what
will
happen
to
law
and
order
we
shall
evolve
law
and
order
through
the
instrumentality
of
these
very
lawyers
we
shall
promote
arbitration
courts
and
dispense
justice
pure
simple
justice
swadeshi
justice
to
our
countrymen
that
is
what
suspension
of
practice
means
parents
and
i
have
suggested
yet
another
difficulty
to
withdraw
our
children
from
the
government
schools
and
to
ask
collegiate
students
to
withdraw
from
the
college
and
to
empty
government
aided
schools
how
could
i
do
otherwise
i
want
to
gauge
the
national
sentiment
i
want
to
know
whether
the
mahomodans
feel
deeply
if
they
feel
deeply
they
will
understand
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
that
it
is
not
right
for
them
to
receive
schooling
from
a
government
in
which
they
have
lost
all
faith
and
which
they
do
not
trust
at
all
how
can
i
if
i
do
not
want
to
help
this
government
receive
any
help
from
that
government
i
think
that
the
schools
and
colleges
are
factories
for
making
clerks
and
government
servants
i
would
not
help
this
great
factory
for
manufacturing
clerks
and
servants
if
i
want
to
withdraw
from
that
government
look
at
it
from
any
point
of
view
you
like
it
is
not
possible
for
you
to
send
your
children
to
the
schools
and
still
believe
in
the
doctrine
of
the
duty
of
title
holders
i
have
gone
further
i
have
suggested
that
our
title
holders
should
give
up
their
titles
how
can
they
hold
on
to
the
titles
and
honour
bestowed
by
the
government
they
were
at
one
time
badges
of
honours
when
we
believed
that
national
honour
was
safe
in
their
hands
but
now
they
are
no
longer
badges
of
honour
but
badges
of
dishonour
and
disgrace
when
we
really
believe
that
we
can
not
get
justice
from
this
government
every
title
holder
holds
his
titles
and
honours
as
trustee
for
the
nation
and
in
this
first
step
in
the
withdrawal
of
from
the
government
they
should
surrender
their
titles
without
a
moment
consideration
i
suggest
to
my
mahomedan
countrymen
that
if
they
fail
in
this
primary
duty
they
will
certainly
fail
in
unless
the
masses
themselves
reject
the
classes
and
take
up
in
their
own
hands
and
are
able
to
fight
that
battle
even
as
the
men
of
the
french
revolution
were
able
to
take
the
reins
of
government
in
their
own
hands
leaving
aside
the
leaders
and
marched
to
the
banner
of
victory
i
want
no
revolution
i
want
ordered
progress
i
want
no
disordered
order
i
want
no
chaos
i
want
real
order
to
be
evolved
out
of
this
chaos
which
is
misrepresented
to
me
as
order
if
it
is
order
established
by
a
tyrant
in
order
to
get
hold
of
the
tyrannical
reins
of
government
i
say
that
it
is
no
order
for
me
but
it
is
disorder
i
want
to
evolve
justice
out
of
this
injustice
therefore
i
suggest
to
you
the
passive
if
we
would
only
realise
the
secret
of
this
peaceful
and
infallible
doctrine
you
will
know
and
you
will
find
that
you
will
not
want
to
use
even
an
angry
word
when
they
lift
the
sword
at
you
and
you
will
not
want
even
to
lift
your
little
finger
let
alone
a
stick
or
a
sword
service
to
the
empire
you
may
consider
that
i
have
spoken
these
words
in
anger
because
i
have
considered
the
ways
of
this
government
immoral
unjust
debasing
and
untruthful
i
use
these
adjectives
with
the
greatest
deliberation
i
have
used
them
for
my
own
true
brother
with
whom
i
was
engaged
in
battle
of
for
full
years
and
although
the
ashes
cover
the
remains
of
my
brother
i
tell
you
that
i
used
to
tell
him
that
he
was
unjust
when
his
plans
were
based
upon
immoral
foundation
i
used
to
tell
him
that
he
did
not
stand
for
truth
there
was
no
anger
in
me
i
told
him
this
home
truth
because
i
loved
him
in
the
same
manner
i
tell
the
british
people
that
i
love
them
and
that
i
want
their
association
but
i
want
that
association
on
conditions
well
defined
i
want
my
and
i
want
my
absolute
equality
with
them
if
i
can
not
gain
that
equality
from
the
british
people
i
do
not
want
that
british
connection
if
i
have
to
let
the
british
people
go
and
import
temporary
disorder
and
dislocation
of
national
business
i
will
favour
that
disorder
and
dislocation
than
that
i
should
have
injustice
from
the
hands
of
a
great
nation
such
as
the
british
nation
you
will
find
that
by
the
time
the
whole
chapter
is
closed
that
the
successors
of
montagu
will
give
me
the
credit
for
having
rendered
the
most
distinguished
service
that
i
have
yet
rendered
to
the
empire
in
having
offered
this
and
in
having
suggest
the
boycott
not
of
his
royal
highness
the
principle
of
wales
but
of
boycott
of
a
visit
engineered
by
government
in
order
to
tighten
its
hold
on
the
national
neck
i
will
not
allow
it
even
if
i
stand
alone
if
i
can
not
persuade
this
nation
not
to
welcome
that
visit
but
will
boycott
that
visit
with
all
the
power
at
my
command
it
is
for
that
reason
i
stand
before
you
and
implore
you
to
offer
this
religious
battle
but
it
is
not
a
battle
offered
to
you
by
a
visionary
or
a
saint
i
deny
being
a
visionary
i
do
not
accept
the
claim
of
saintliness
i
am
of
the
earth
earthy
a
common
gardener
man
as
much
as
any
one
of
you
probably
much
more
than
you
are
i
am
prone
to
as
many
weaknesses
as
you
are
but
i
have
seen
the
world
i
have
lived
in
the
world
with
my
eyes
open
i
have
gone
through
the
most
fiery
ordeals
that
have
fallen
to
the
lot
of
man
i
have
gone
through
this
discipline
i
have
understood
the
secret
of
my
own
sacred
hinduism
i
have
learnt
the
lesson
that
is
the
duty
not
merely
of
the
saint
but
it
is
the
duty
of
every
ordinary
citizen
who
not
know
much
not
caring
to
know
much
but
wants
to
perform
his
ordinary
household
functions
the
people
of
europe
touch
even
their
masses
the
poor
people
the
doctrine
of
the
sword
but
the
rishis
of
india
those
who
have
held
the
tradition
of
india
have
preached
to
the
masses
of
india
this
doctrine
not
of
the
sword
not
of
violence
but
of
suffering
of
and
unless
you
and
i
am
prepared
to
go
through
this
primary
lesson
we
are
not
ready
even
to
offer
the
sword
and
that
is
the
lesson
my
brother
shaukal
ali
has
imbibed
to
teach
and
that
is
why
he
accepts
my
advice
tendered
to
him
in
all
prayerfulness
and
in
all
humility
and
says
live
please
remember
that
even
in
england
the
little
children
were
withdrawn
from
the
schools
and
colleges
in
cambridge
and
oxford
were
closed
lawyers
had
left
their
desks
and
were
fighting
in
the
trenches
i
do
not
present
to
you
the
trenches
but
i
do
ask
you
to
go
through
the
sacrifice
that
the
men
women
and
the
brave
lads
of
england
went
through
remember
that
you
are
offering
battle
to
a
nation
which
is
saturated
with
their
spirit
of
sacrifice
whenever
the
occasion
arises
remember
that
the
little
band
of
boers
offered
stubborn
resistance
to
a
mighty
nation
but
their
lawyers
had
left
their
desks
their
mothers
had
withdrawn
their
children
from
the
schools
and
colleges
and
the
children
had
become
the
volunteers
of
the
nation
i
have
seen
them
with
these
naked
eyes
of
mine
i
am
asking
my
countrymen
in
india
to
follow
no
other
gospel
than
the
gospel
of
which
precedes
every
battle
whether
you
belong
to
the
school
of
violence
or
you
will
still
have
to
go
through
the
fire
of
sacrifice
and
of
discipline
may
god
grant
you
may
god
grant
our
leaders
the
wisdom
the
courage
and
the
true
knowledge
to
lead
the
nation
to
its
cherished
goal
may
god
grant
the
people
of
india
the
right
path
the
true
vision
and
the
ability
and
the
courage
to
follow
this
path
difficult
and
yet
easy
of
sacrifice
speech
at
trichinopoly
mahatma
gandhi
made
the
following
speech
at
trichinopoly
on
the
august
i
think
you
on
behalf
of
my
brother
shaukat
ali
and
myself
for
the
magnificent
reception
that
the
citizens
of
trichinopoly
have
given
to
us
i
thank
you
also
for
the
many
addresses
that
you
have
been
good
enough
to
present
to
us
but
i
must
come
to
business
it
is
a
great
pleasure
to
me
to
renew
your
acquaintance
for
reasons
that
i
need
not
give
you
i
expect
great
things
from
trichinopoly
madura
and
a
few
places
i
could
name
i
take
it
that
you
have
read
my
address
on
the
madras
beach
on
without
taking
up
your
time
in
this
great
assembly
i
wish
to
deal
with
one
or
two
matters
that
arise
out
of
kasturiranga
iyongar
speech
he
says
in
effect
that
i
should
have
waited
for
the
congress
mandate
on
that
was
impossible
because
the
mussulmans
had
and
still
have
a
duty
irrespective
of
the
hindus
to
perform
in
reference
to
their
own
religion
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
wait
for
any
mandate
save
the
mandate
of
their
own
religion
in
a
matter
that
vitally
concerned
the
honour
of
islam
it
is
therefore
possible
for
them
only
to
go
to
the
congress
on
bended
knees
with
a
clear
cut
programme
of
their
own
and
ask
the
congress
to
pronounce
its
blessings
upon
that
programme
and
if
they
are
not
so
fortunate
as
to
secure
the
blessings
of
the
national
assembly
without
meaning
any
disrespect
to
that
assembly
it
is
their
bounden
duty
to
go
on
with
their
programme
and
so
it
is
the
duty
of
every
hindu
who
considers
his
mussalman
brother
as
a
brother
who
has
a
just
cause
which
he
wishes
to
vindicate
to
throw
in
his
lot
with
his
mussalman
brother
our
leader
does
not
quarrel
with
the
principle
of
by
itself
but
he
objects
to
the
three
principal
details
of
council
elections
he
considers
that
it
is
our
duty
to
seek
election
to
the
councils
and
fight
our
battle
on
the
floor
of
the
council
hall
i
do
not
deny
the
possibility
of
a
fight
and
a
royal
fight
on
the
council
floor
we
have
done
it
for
the
last
years
but
i
venture
to
suggest
to
you
and
to
him
with
all
due
respect
that
it
is
not
and
it
is
not
half
as
successful
as
can
be
you
can
not
go
to
a
class
of
people
with
a
view
to
convince
them
by
any
fight
call
it
even
obstruction
who
have
got
a
settled
conviction
and
a
settled
policy
to
follow
it
is
in
medical
language
an
incompatible
mixture
out
of
which
you
can
gain
nothing
but
if
you
totally
boycott
the
council
you
create
a
public
opinion
in
the
country
with
reference
to
the
khilafat
wrong
and
the
punjab
wrong
which
will
become
totally
irresistible
the
first
advantage
of
going
to
the
councils
must
be
on
the
part
of
the
rulers
it
is
absolutely
lacking
in
the
place
of
you
have
got
nothing
but
injustice
but
i
must
move
on
lawyers
practice
i
come
now
to
the
second
objection
of
kasturiranga
iyengar
with
reference
to
the
suspension
by
lawyers
of
their
practice
milk
is
good
in
itself
but
it
comes
absolutely
poisonous
immediately
a
little
bit
of
arsenic
is
added
to
it
law
courts
are
similarly
good
when
justice
is
distilled
through
them
on
behalf
of
a
sovereign
power
which
wants
to
do
justice
to
its
people
law
courts
are
one
of
the
greatest
symbols
of
power
and
in
the
battle
of
you
may
not
leave
law
courts
untouched
and
claim
to
offer
but
if
you
will
read
that
objection
carefully
you
will
find
in
that
objection
the
great
fear
that
the
lawyers
will
not
respond
to
the
call
that
the
country
makes
upon
them
and
it
is
just
there
that
the
beauty
of
comes
in
if
one
lawyer
alone
suspends
practice
it
is
so
much
to
the
good
of
the
country
and
so
if
we
are
sure
to
deprive
the
government
of
the
power
that
it
possess
through
its
law
courts
whether
one
lawyer
takes
it
up
or
many
we
must
adopt
that
step
government
schools
he
objects
also
to
the
plan
of
boycotting
government
schools
i
can
only
say
what
i
have
said
with
reference
to
lawyers
that
if
we
mean
we
may
not
receive
any
favours
from
the
government
no
matter
how
advantageous
by
themselves
they
may
be
in
a
great
struggle
like
this
it
is
not
open
to
us
to
count
how
many
schools
will
respond
and
how
many
parents
will
respond
and
just
as
a
geometrical
problem
is
difficult
because
it
does
not
admit
of
easy
proof
so
also
because
a
certain
stage
in
national
evolution
is
difficult
you
may
not
avoid
that
step
without
making
the
whole
of
the
evolution
a
farce
we
have
had
a
great
lesson
in
and
we
had
a
lesson
in
when
some
young
men
began
to
fight
there
and
it
is
a
dangerous
weapon
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
about
it
one
man
with
a
determined
will
to
can
disturb
a
whole
meeting
and
we
had
a
physical
demonstration
of
it
to
night
but
ours
is
in
which
there
can
be
no
mistake
whatsoever
in
the
fundamental
conditions
are
observed
if
fails
it
will
not
be
for
want
of
any
inherent
strength
in
it
but
it
will
fall
because
there
is
no
response
to
it
or
because
people
have
not
sufficiently
grasped
its
simple
principles
you
had
also
a
practical
demonstration
of
just
now
that
heavy
chair
went
over
the
heads
of
so
many
people
because
all
wanted
to
lift
their
little
hand
to
move
that
chair
away
from
them
and
so
was
that
heavier
dome
also
removed
from
our
sight
by
of
man
woman
and
child
everybody
believes
and
knows
that
this
government
of
our
exists
only
by
the
of
the
people
and
not
by
the
force
of
arms
it
can
wield
and
everyman
with
a
sense
of
logic
will
tell
you
that
the
converse
of
that
also
is
equally
true
that
government
can
not
stand
if
this
on
which
it
exists
is
withdrawn
difficulties
undoubtedly
there
are
we
have
hitherto
learned
how
to
sacrifice
our
voice
and
make
speeches
we
must
also
learn
to
sacrifice
ease
money
comfort
and
that
we
may
learn
form
the
englishmen
themselves
every
one
who
has
studied
english
history
knows
that
we
are
now
engaged
in
a
battle
with
a
nation
which
is
capable
of
great
sacrifice
and
the
three
hundred
millions
of
india
can
not
make
their
mark
upon
the
world
or
gain
their
without
an
adequate
measure
of
sacrifice
boycott
of
british
goods
our
friend
has
suggested
the
boycott
of
british
or
foreign
goods
boycott
of
all
foreign
goods
is
another
name
for
swadeshi
he
thinks
that
there
will
be
a
greater
response
in
the
boycott
of
all
foreign
goods
with
the
experience
of
years
behind
me
and
with
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
mercantile
classes
i
venture
to
tell
you
that
boycott
of
foreign
goods
or
boycott
of
merely
british
goods
is
more
impracticable
than
any
of
the
stops
i
have
suggested
whereas
in
all
the
steps
that
i
have
ventured
to
suggest
there
is
practically
no
sacrifice
of
money
involved
in
the
boycott
of
british
or
foreign
goods
you
are
inviting
your
merchant
princes
to
sacrifice
their
millions
it
has
got
to
be
done
but
it
is
an
exceedingly
low
process
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
steps
that
i
have
ventured
to
suggest
i
know
but
boycott
of
goods
in
conceived
as
a
punishment
and
the
punishment
is
only
effective
when
it
is
inflicted
what
i
have
ventured
to
suggest
is
not
a
punishment
but
the
performance
of
a
sacred
duty
a
measure
of
from
ourselves
and
therefore
it
is
effective
from
its
very
inception
when
it
is
undertaken
even
by
one
man
and
a
substantial
duty
performed
even
by
one
single
man
lays
the
foundation
of
nations
liberty
conclusion
i
am
most
anxious
for
my
nation
for
my
mussalman
brethren
also
to
understand
that
if
they
want
to
vindicate
national
honour
or
the
honour
of
islam
it
will
be
vindicated
without
a
shadow
of
doubt
not
be
conceiving
a
punishment
or
a
series
of
punishments
but
by
an
adequate
measure
of
i
wish
to
speak
of
all
our
leaders
in
terms
of
the
greatest
respect
but
whatever
respect
we
wish
to
pay
them
may
not
stop
or
arrest
the
progress
of
the
country
and
i
am
most
anxious
that
the
country
at
this
very
critical
period
of
its
history
should
make
its
choice
the
choice
clearly
does
not
lie
before
you
and
me
in
wresting
by
force
of
arms
the
sceptre
form
the
british
nation
but
the
choice
lies
in
suffering
this
double
wrong
of
the
khilafat
and
the
punjab
in
pocketing
humiliation
and
in
accepting
national
emasculation
or
vindication
of
india
honour
by
sacrifice
by
every
man
woman
and
child
and
those
who
feel
convinced
of
the
rightness
of
things
we
should
make
that
choice
so
citizens
of
trichinopoly
you
may
not
wait
for
the
whole
of
india
but
you
can
enforce
the
first
step
of
and
begin
your
operations
even
from
if
you
have
not
done
so
already
you
can
surrender
all
your
titles
all
the
lawyers
may
surrender
their
practice
those
who
can
not
sustain
body
and
soul
by
any
other
means
can
be
easily
supported
by
the
khilafat
committee
if
they
will
give
their
whole
time
and
attention
to
the
work
of
that
committee
and
if
the
layers
will
kindly
do
that
you
will
find
that
there
is
no
difficulty
in
settling
your
disputes
by
private
arbitration
you
can
nationalise
your
schools
from
if
you
have
got
the
will
and
the
determination
it
is
difficult
i
know
when
only
a
few
of
you
think
these
things
it
is
as
easy
as
we
are
sitting
here
when
the
whole
of
this
vast
audience
is
of
one
mind
and
as
it
was
easy
for
you
to
carry
that
chair
so
is
it
easy
for
you
to
enforce
this
programme
from
if
you
have
one
will
one
determination
and
love
for
your
country
love
for
the
honour
of
your
country
and
religion
loud
and
prolonged
cheers
speech
at
calicut
chairman
and
on
behalf
of
my
brother
shaukut
ali
and
myself
i
wish
to
thank
you
most
sincerely
for
the
warm
welcome
you
have
extended
to
us
before
i
begin
to
explain
the
purpose
of
our
mission
i
have
to
give
you
the
information
that
pir
mahboob
shah
who
was
being
tried
in
sindh
for
sedition
has
been
sentenced
to
two
years
simple
imprisonment
i
do
not
know
exactly
what
the
offence
was
with
which
the
pir
was
charged
i
do
not
know
whether
the
words
attributed
to
him
were
ever
spoken
by
him
but
i
do
know
that
the
pirsaheb
declined
to
offer
any
defence
and
with
perfect
resignation
he
has
accepted
his
penalty
for
me
it
is
a
matter
of
sincere
pleasure
that
the
pirsaheb
who
exercises
great
influence
over
his
followers
has
understood
the
spirit
of
the
struggle
upon
which
we
have
embarked
it
is
not
by
resisting
the
authority
of
government
that
we
expect
to
succeed
in
the
great
task
before
us
but
i
do
expect
that
we
shall
succeed
if
we
understand
the
spirit
of
the
of
burma
himself
has
told
us
that
the
british
retain
their
hold
on
india
not
by
the
force
of
arms
but
by
the
force
of
of
the
people
thus
he
has
given
us
the
remedy
for
any
wrong
that
the
government
may
do
to
the
people
whether
knowingly
or
unknowingly
and
so
long
as
we
with
the
government
so
long
as
we
support
that
government
we
become
to
that
extent
sharers
in
the
wrong
i
admit
that
in
ordinary
circumstances
a
wise
subject
will
tolerate
the
wrongs
of
a
government
but
a
wise
subject
never
tolerates
a
wrong
that
a
government
imposes
on
the
declared
will
of
a
people
and
i
venture
to
submit
to
this
great
meeting
that
the
government
of
india
and
the
imperial
government
have
done
a
double
wrong
to
india
and
if
we
are
a
nation
of
people
conscious
of
its
dignity
conscious
of
its
right
it
is
not
just
and
proper
that
we
should
stand
the
double
humiliation
that
the
government
has
heaped
upon
us
by
shaping
and
by
becoming
a
predominant
partner
in
the
peace
terms
imposed
on
the
helpless
sultan
of
turkey
the
imperial
government
have
intentionally
flouted
the
cherished
sentiment
of
the
mussalman
subjects
of
the
empire
the
present
prime
minister
gave
a
deliberate
pledge
after
consultation
with
his
colleagues
when
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
conciliate
the
mussalmans
of
india
i
claim
to
have
studied
this
khilafat
question
in
a
special
manner
i
claim
to
understand
the
mussalman
feeling
on
the
khilafat
question
and
i
am
here
to
declare
for
the
tenth
time
that
on
the
khilafat
matter
the
government
has
wounded
the
mussalman
sentiment
as
they
had
never
done
before
and
i
say
without
fear
of
contradiction
that
if
the
mussalmans
of
india
had
not
exercised
great
and
if
there
was
not
the
gospel
of
preached
to
them
and
if
they
had
not
accepted
it
there
would
have
been
bloodshed
in
india
by
this
time
i
am
free
to
confess
that
spilling
of
blood
would
not
have
availed
their
cause
but
a
man
who
is
in
a
state
of
rage
whose
heart
has
become
lacerated
does
not
count
the
cost
of
his
action
so
much
for
the
khilafat
wrong
i
propose
to
take
you
for
a
minute
to
the
punjab
the
northern
end
of
india
and
what
have
both
governments
done
for
the
punjab
i
am
free
to
confess
again
that
the
crowds
in
amritsar
went
mad
for
a
moment
they
were
goaded
to
madness
by
a
wicked
administration
but
no
madness
on
the
part
of
a
people
can
justify
the
shedding
of
innocent
blood
and
what
have
they
paid
for
it
i
venture
to
submit
that
no
civilised
government
could
ever
have
made
the
people
pay
the
penalty
and
retribution
that
they
have
paid
innocent
men
were
tried
through
and
imprisoned
for
life
amnesty
granted
to
them
after
i
count
of
no
consequence
innocent
unarmed
men
who
knew
nothing
of
what
was
to
happen
were
butchered
in
cold
blood
without
the
slightest
notice
modesty
of
women
in
manianwalla
women
who
had
done
no
wrong
to
any
individual
was
outraged
by
insolent
officers
i
want
you
to
understand
what
i
mean
by
outrage
of
their
modesty
their
veils
were
opened
with
his
stick
by
an
officer
men
who
were
declared
to
be
utterly
innocent
by
the
hunter
committee
were
made
to
crawl
on
their
bellies
and
all
these
wrongs
totally
undeserved
remain
unavenged
if
it
was
the
duty
of
the
government
of
india
to
punish
those
who
were
guilty
of
incendiarism
and
murder
as
i
hold
it
was
their
duty
it
was
doubly
their
duty
to
punish
officers
who
insulted
and
oppressed
innocent
people
but
in
the
face
of
these
official
wrongs
we
have
the
debate
in
the
house
of
lords
supporting
official
terrorism
it
is
this
double
wrong
the
affront
to
islam
and
the
injury
to
the
manhood
of
the
punjab
that
we
feel
bound
to
wipe
out
by
we
have
prayed
petitioned
agitated
we
have
passed
resolutions
mahomed
ali
supported
by
his
friends
is
now
waiting
on
the
british
public
he
has
pleaded
the
cause
of
islam
in
a
most
manful
manner
but
his
pleading
has
fallen
on
deaf
ears
and
we
have
his
word
for
it
that
whilst
france
and
italy
have
shown
great
sympathy
for
the
cause
of
islam
it
is
the
british
ministers
who
have
shown
no
sympathy
this
shows
which
way
the
british
ministers
and
the
present
holders
of
office
in
india
mean
to
deal
by
the
people
there
is
no
goodwill
there
is
no
desire
to
placate
the
people
of
india
the
people
of
india
must
therefore
have
a
remedy
to
redress
the
double
wrong
the
method
of
the
west
is
violence
wherever
the
people
of
the
west
have
felt
a
wrong
either
justly
or
unjustly
they
have
rebelled
and
shed
blood
as
i
have
said
in
my
letter
to
the
viceroy
of
india
half
of
india
does
not
believe
in
the
remedy
of
violence
the
other
half
is
too
weak
to
offer
it
but
the
whole
of
india
is
deeply
hurt
and
stirred
by
this
wrong
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
i
have
suggested
to
the
people
of
india
the
remedy
of
i
consider
it
perfectly
harmless
absolutely
constitutional
and
yet
perfectly
efficacious
it
is
a
remedy
in
which
if
it
is
properly
adopted
victory
is
certain
and
it
is
the
remedy
of
are
the
mussalmans
of
india
who
feel
the
great
wrong
done
to
islam
ready
to
make
an
adequate
all
the
scriptures
of
the
world
teach
us
that
there
can
be
no
compromise
between
justice
and
injustice
on
the
part
of
a
man
with
an
unjust
man
is
a
crime
and
if
we
desire
to
compel
this
great
government
to
the
will
of
the
people
as
we
must
we
must
adopt
this
great
remedy
of
and
if
the
mussalmans
of
india
offer
to
government
in
order
to
secure
justice
in
the
khilafat
matter
i
believe
it
is
duty
of
the
hindus
to
help
them
so
long
as
their
moans
are
just
i
consider
the
eternal
friendship
between
the
hindus
and
mussalmans
is
more
important
than
the
british
connection
i
would
prefer
any
day
anarchy
and
chaos
in
india
to
an
armed
peace
brought
about
by
the
bayonet
between
the
hindus
and
mussalmans
i
have
therefore
ventured
to
suggest
to
my
hindu
brethren
that
if
they
wanted
to
live
at
peace
with
mussalmans
there
is
an
opportunity
which
is
not
going
to
recur
for
the
next
hundred
years
and
i
venture
to
assure
you
that
if
the
government
of
india
and
the
imperial
government
come
to
know
that
there
is
a
determination
on
the
part
of
the
people
to
redress
this
double
wrong
they
would
not
hesitate
to
do
what
is
needed
but
in
the
mussalmans
of
india
will
have
to
take
the
lead
in
the
matter
you
will
have
to
commence
the
first
stage
of
in
right
earnest
and
if
you
may
not
help
this
government
you
may
not
receive
help
from
it
titles
which
were
the
other
day
titles
of
honour
are
in
my
opinion
badges
of
our
disgrace
we
must
therefore
surrender
all
titles
of
honour
all
honorary
offices
it
will
constitute
an
emphatic
demonstration
of
the
disapproval
by
the
leaders
of
the
people
of
the
acts
of
the
government
lawyers
must
suspend
their
practice
and
must
resist
the
power
of
the
government
which
has
chosen
to
flout
public
opinion
nor
may
we
receive
instruction
from
schools
controlled
by
government
and
aided
by
it
emptying
of
the
schools
will
constitute
a
demonstration
of
the
will
of
the
middle
class
of
india
it
is
far
better
for
the
nation
even
to
neglect
the
literary
instruction
of
the
children
than
to
with
a
government
that
has
striven
to
maintain
an
injustice
and
untruth
on
the
khilafat
and
punjab
matters
similarly
have
i
ventured
to
suggest
a
complete
boycott
of
reformed
councils
that
will
be
an
emphatic
declaration
of
the
part
of
the
representatives
of
the
people
that
they
do
not
desire
to
associate
with
the
government
so
long
as
the
two
wrongs
continue
we
must
equally
decline
to
offer
ourselves
as
recruits
for
the
police
or
the
military
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
go
to
mesopotamia
or
to
offer
to
police
that
country
or
to
offer
military
assistance
and
to
help
the
government
in
that
blood
guiltiness
the
last
plank
in
the
first
stage
is
swadeshi
swadeshi
is
intended
not
so
much
to
bring
pressure
upon
the
government
as
to
demonstrate
the
capacity
for
sacrifice
on
the
part
of
the
men
and
women
of
india
when
of
india
has
its
religion
at
stake
and
when
the
whole
of
india
has
its
honour
at
stake
we
can
be
in
no
mood
to
bedeck
ourselves
with
french
calico
or
silks
from
japan
we
must
resolve
to
be
satisfied
with
cloth
woven
by
the
humble
weavers
of
india
in
their
own
cottages
out
of
yarn
spun
by
their
sisters
in
their
own
homes
when
a
hundred
years
ago
our
tastes
were
not
debased
and
we
were
not
lured
by
all
the
fineries
from
the
foreign
countries
we
were
satisfied
with
the
cloth
produced
by
the
men
and
women
in
india
and
if
i
could
but
in
a
moment
revolutionize
the
tastes
of
india
and
make
it
return
to
its
original
simplicity
i
assure
you
that
the
gods
would
descent
to
rejoice
at
the
great
act
of
renunciation
that
is
the
first
stage
in
i
hope
it
is
as
easy
for
you
as
it
is
easy
for
me
to
see
that
if
india
is
capable
of
taking
the
first
step
in
anything
like
a
full
measure
that
step
will
bring
the
redress
we
want
i
therefore
do
not
intend
to
take
you
to
the
other
stages
of
i
would
like
you
to
rivet
your
attention
upon
the
plans
in
the
first
stage
you
will
have
noticed
that
but
two
things
are
necessary
in
going
through
the
first
stage
prefect
spirit
of
is
indispensable
for
only
a
little
i
pray
to
god
that
he
will
give
the
people
of
india
sufficient
courage
and
wisdom
and
patience
to
go
through
this
experiment
of
i
think
you
for
the
great
reception
that
you
have
given
us
and
i
also
thank
you
for
the
great
patience
and
exemplary
silence
with
which
you
have
listened
to
my
remarks
speech
at
mangalore
chairman
and
friends
to
my
brother
shaukat
ali
and
me
it
was
a
pleasure
to
go
through
this
beautiful
garden
of
india
the
great
reception
that
you
gave
us
this
afternoon
and
this
great
assembly
are
most
welcome
to
us
if
they
are
a
demonstration
of
your
sympathy
with
the
cause
which
you
have
the
honour
to
represent
i
assure
you
that
we
have
not
undertaken
this
incessant
travelling
in
order
to
have
receptions
and
addresses
no
matter
how
cordial
they
may
be
but
we
have
undertaken
this
travelling
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
this
dear
motherland
to
place
before
you
the
position
that
faces
us
it
is
our
privilege
as
it
is
our
duty
to
place
that
position
before
the
country
and
let
her
make
the
choice
throughout
our
tour
we
have
received
many
addresses
but
in
my
humble
opinion
no
address
was
more
truly
worded
than
the
address
that
was
presented
to
us
at
kasargod
it
addressed
both
of
us
as
revered
brothers
i
am
unable
to
accept
the
second
adjective
the
word
is
dear
to
me
i
must
confess
but
dearer
than
that
is
the
expression
the
signatories
to
that
address
recognized
the
true
significance
of
this
travel
no
blood
brothers
can
possibly
be
more
intimately
related
can
possibly
be
more
united
in
one
purpose
one
aim
than
my
brother
shaukat
ali
and
i
and
i
considered
it
a
proud
privilege
and
honour
to
be
addressed
as
blood
brother
to
shaukat
ali
the
contents
of
that
address
were
as
equally
significant
it
stated
that
in
our
united
work
was
represented
the
essence
of
the
unity
between
the
mussalmans
and
hindus
in
india
if
we
two
can
not
represent
that
very
desirable
unity
if
we
two
can
not
cement
the
relation
between
the
two
communities
i
do
not
know
who
can
then
without
any
rhetoric
and
without
any
flowery
language
the
address
went
on
to
describe
the
inwardness
of
the
punjab
and
the
khilafat
struggle
and
then
in
simple
and
beautiful
language
it
described
the
spiritual
significance
of
satyagrah
and
this
was
followed
by
a
frank
and
simple
promise
although
the
signatories
to
the
address
realised
the
momentous
nature
of
the
struggle
on
which
we
have
embarked
and
although
they
sympathise
with
the
struggle
with
their
whole
heart
they
wound
up
by
saying
that
even
if
they
could
not
follow
in
all
its
details
they
would
do
as
much
as
they
could
to
help
the
struggle
and
lastly
in
eloquent
and
true
language
they
said
we
can
not
rise
equal
to
the
occasion
it
will
not
be
due
to
want
of
effort
but
to
want
of
ability
i
can
desire
no
better
address
no
better
promise
and
if
you
the
citizens
of
mangalore
can
come
up
to
the
level
of
the
signatories
and
give
us
just
the
assurance
that
you
consider
the
struggle
to
be
right
and
that
it
commands
your
entire
approval
i
am
certain
you
will
make
all
sacrifice
that
lies
in
your
power
for
we
are
face
to
face
with
a
peril
greater
than
plagues
greater
than
influenza
greater
than
earthquakes
and
mighty
floods
which
sometimes
overwhelm
this
land
these
physical
calamities
can
rob
us
of
so
many
indian
bodies
but
the
calamity
that
has
at
the
present
moment
overtaken
india
touches
the
religious
honour
of
a
fourth
of
her
children
and
the
of
the
whole
nation
the
khilafat
wrong
affects
the
mussalmans
of
india
and
the
punjab
calamity
very
nearly
overwhelms
the
manhood
of
india
shall
we
in
the
face
of
this
danger
be
weak
or
rise
to
our
full
height
the
remedy
for
both
the
wrongs
is
the
spiritual
solvent
of
i
call
it
a
spiritual
weapon
because
it
demands
discipline
and
sacrifice
from
us
it
demands
sacrifice
from
every
individual
irrespective
of
the
rest
and
the
promise
that
is
behind
this
performance
of
duty
the
promise
given
by
every
religion
that
i
have
studied
is
sure
and
certain
it
is
that
there
is
no
spotless
sacrifice
that
has
been
yet
offered
on
earth
which
has
not
carried
with
it
its
absolute
adequate
reward
it
is
a
spiritual
weapon
because
it
waits
for
no
mandate
from
anybody
except
one
own
conscience
it
is
a
spiritual
weapon
because
it
brings
out
the
best
in
the
nation
and
it
absolutely
satisfies
individual
honour
if
a
single
individual
takes
it
and
it
will
satisfy
national
honour
if
the
whole
nation
takes
it
up
and
therefore
it
is
that
i
have
called
in
opposition
to
the
opinion
of
many
of
my
distinguished
countrymen
and
leaders
a
weapon
that
is
infallible
and
absolutely
practicable
it
is
infallible
and
practicable
because
it
satisfies
the
demands
of
individual
conscience
god
above
can
not
will
not
expect
maulana
shaukat
ali
to
do
more
than
he
has
been
doing
for
he
has
surrendered
and
placed
at
the
disposal
of
god
whom
he
believes
to
be
the
almighty
ruler
of
everyone
he
has
delivered
all
in
the
service
of
god
and
we
stand
before
the
citizens
of
mangalore
and
ask
them
to
make
their
choice
either
to
accept
this
precious
gift
that
we
lay
at
their
feet
or
to
reject
it
and
after
having
listened
to
my
message
if
you
come
to
the
come
to
the
conclusion
that
you
have
no
other
remedy
than
for
the
conservation
of
islam
and
the
honour
of
india
you
will
accept
that
remedy
i
ask
you
not
to
be
confused
by
so
many
bewildering
issues
that
are
placed
before
you
nor
to
be
shaken
from
your
purpose
because
you
see
divided
counsels
amongst
your
leaders
this
is
one
of
the
necessary
limitations
of
any
spiritual
or
any
other
struggle
that
has
ever
been
fought
on
this
earth
it
is
because
it
comes
so
suddenly
that
it
confuses
the
mind
if
the
heart
is
not
tuned
properly
and
we
would
be
perfect
human
beings
on
this
earth
if
in
all
of
us
was
found
absolutely
perfect
correspondence
between
the
mind
and
the
heart
but
those
of
you
who
have
been
following
the
newspaper
controversy
will
find
that
no
matter
what
division
of
opinion
exists
amongst
our
journals
and
leaders
there
is
unanimity
that
the
remedy
is
efficacious
if
it
can
be
kept
free
from
violence
and
if
it
is
adopted
on
a
large
scale
i
admit
the
difficulty
the
virtue
however
lies
in
surmounting
it
we
can
not
possibly
combine
violence
with
a
spiritual
weapon
like
we
do
not
offer
spotless
sacrifice
if
we
take
the
lives
of
others
in
offering
our
own
absolute
freedom
from
violence
is
therefore
it
condition
precedent
to
but
i
have
faith
in
my
country
to
know
that
when
it
has
assimilated
the
principle
of
the
doctrine
in
the
fullest
extent
it
will
respond
to
it
and
in
no
case
will
india
make
any
headway
whatsoever
until
she
has
learnt
the
lesson
of
even
if
this
country
were
to
take
up
the
doctrine
of
the
sword
which
god
forbid
it
will
have
to
learn
the
lesson
of
the
second
difficulty
suggested
is
the
want
of
solidarity
of
the
nation
i
accept
it
too
but
that
difficulty
i
have
already
answered
by
saying
that
it
is
a
remedy
that
can
be
taken
up
by
individuals
for
individual
and
by
the
nation
for
national
satisfaction
and
therefore
even
if
the
whole
nation
does
not
take
up
the
individual
successes
which
may
be
obtained
by
individuals
taking
up
will
stand
to
their
own
credit
as
of
the
nation
to
which
they
belong
the
first
stage
in
my
humble
opinion
is
incredibly
easy
inasmuch
as
it
does
not
involve
any
very
great
sacrifice
if
your
khan
bahadurs
and
other
were
to
renounce
their
titles
i
venture
to
submit
that
whilst
the
renunciation
will
stand
to
the
credit
and
honour
of
the
nation
it
will
involve
a
little
or
no
sacrifice
on
the
contrary
they
will
not
only
have
surrendered
no
earthly
riches
but
they
will
have
gained
the
applause
of
the
nation
let
us
see
what
it
means
this
first
step
the
able
editor
of
kastariranga
iyengar
and
almost
every
journalist
in
the
country
are
agreed
that
the
renunciation
of
titles
is
a
necessary
and
a
desirable
step
and
if
these
chosen
people
of
the
government
were
without
exception
to
surrender
their
titles
to
government
giving
notice
that
the
heart
of
india
is
doubly
wounded
in
that
the
honour
of
india
and
of
muslim
religion
is
at
stake
and
that
therefore
they
can
no
longer
retain
their
titles
i
venture
to
suggest
that
this
their
step
which
costs
not
a
single
penny
either
to
them
or
to
the
nation
will
be
an
effective
demonstration
of
the
national
will
take
the
second
step
or
the
second
item
of
i
know
there
is
strong
opposition
to
the
boycott
of
councils
the
opposition
when
you
begin
to
analyse
it
means
not
that
the
step
is
faulty
or
that
it
is
not
likely
to
succeed
but
it
is
due
to
the
belief
that
the
whole
country
will
not
respond
to
it
and
that
the
moderates
will
steal
into
the
councils
i
ask
the
citizens
of
mangalore
to
dispel
that
fear
from
your
hearts
united
the
voters
of
mangalore
can
make
it
impossible
for
either
a
moderate
or
an
extremist
or
any
other
form
of
leader
to
enter
the
councils
as
your
representative
this
step
involves
no
sacrifice
of
money
no
sacrifice
of
honour
but
the
gaining
of
prestige
for
the
whole
nation
and
i
venture
to
suggest
to
you
that
this
one
step
alone
if
it
is
taken
with
any
degree
of
unanimity
even
by
the
extremists
can
bring
about
the
desired
relief
but
if
all
do
not
respond
the
individual
need
not
be
afraid
he
at
least
will
have
laid
the
foundation
for
true
self
progress
let
him
have
the
comfort
that
he
at
least
has
washed
his
hands
clean
of
the
guilt
of
the
government
then
i
come
to
the
members
of
the
profession
which
one
time
i
used
to
carry
on
i
have
ventured
to
ask
the
lawyers
of
india
to
suspend
their
practice
and
withdraw
their
support
from
a
government
which
no
longer
stands
for
justice
pure
and
unadulterated
for
the
nation
and
the
step
is
good
for
the
individual
lawyer
who
takes
it
and
is
good
for
the
nation
if
all
the
lawyers
take
it
and
so
for
the
government
and
the
government
aided
schools
i
must
confess
that
i
can
not
reconcile
my
conscience
to
my
children
going
to
government
schools
and
to
the
programme
of
is
intended
to
withdraw
all
support
from
government
and
to
decline
all
help
from
it
i
will
not
tax
your
patience
by
taking
you
through
the
other
items
of
important
as
they
are
but
i
have
ventured
to
place
before
you
four
very
important
and
forcible
steps
any
one
of
which
if
fully
taken
up
contains
in
it
possibilities
of
success
swadeshi
is
preached
as
an
item
of
as
a
demonstration
of
the
spirit
of
sacrifice
and
it
is
an
item
which
every
man
woman
and
child
can
take
up
speech
at
bezwada
as
i
said
this
morning
one
essential
condition
for
the
progress
of
india
is
unity
i
understand
that
there
was
a
little
bit
of
bickering
between
hindus
and
mussalmans
in
bezwada
my
brother
maulana
shaukat
ali
adjusted
the
dispute
between
the
two
communities
and
he
illustrated
in
his
own
person
the
entire
efficacy
of
one
item
in
the
first
stage
of
he
sat
without
any
vakils
appearing
before
him
for
either
parties
to
arbitrate
on
the
dispute
between
them
he
required
no
postponement
for
the
consideration
of
the
question
from
time
to
time
his
fees
consisted
in
a
broken
lead
pencil
that
is
what
we
should
do
if
all
the
lawyers
suspended
practice
and
set
up
arbitration
for
the
settlement
of
private
disputes
but
why
was
there
any
quarrel
at
all
it
is
laughable
in
the
extreme
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
because
the
hindus
seem
to
have
played
music
whilst
passing
the
mosque
i
think
it
was
improper
for
them
to
do
so
hindu
moslem
unity
does
not
mean
that
hindus
should
cease
to
respect
the
prejudices
and
sentiments
cherished
by
mussalmans
and
as
this
question
of
music
has
given
rise
to
many
a
quarrel
between
the
two
communities
it
behoves
the
hindus
if
they
want
to
cultivate
true
unity
to
refrain
from
acts
which
they
know
injure
the
sentiments
of
their
mussalman
brethren
we
may
not
take
undue
advantage
of
the
great
spirit
of
toleration
that
is
developing
in
mussalmans
and
do
things
likely
to
irritate
them
it
is
never
a
matter
of
principle
for
a
hindu
procession
to
continue
playing
music
before
mosques
and
now
that
we
desire
voluntarily
to
respect
mussalman
sentiment
we
should
be
doubly
careful
at
a
time
when
hindus
are
offering
assistance
to
mussalmans
in
their
troubles
that
assistance
should
be
given
in
all
humility
and
without
any
arrogation
of
rights
to
my
mussalman
brethren
i
would
say
that
it
would
become
their
dignity
to
restrain
themselves
and
not
feel
irritated
when
any
hindu
had
done
anything
to
irritate
their
religious
sentiment
but
in
any
event
you
have
today
presented
to
you
a
remedy
for
the
settlement
of
any
such
issue
we
must
settle
our
disputes
by
arbitration
as
was
done
this
you
can
not
always
get
a
moulana
shankat
ali
exercising
unrivalled
influence
on
the
community
but
we
can
always
get
people
enough
in
our
own
villages
towns
and
districts
who
exercise
influence
over
such
villages
and
towns
and
command
the
confidence
of
both
the
communities
the
offended
party
should
consider
it
its
duty
to
approach
them
and
not
to
take
the
law
in
its
own
hands
it
gives
me
much
pleasure
to
announce
to
you
that
kaleswar
rao
has
consented
to
refrain
from
standing
for
election
to
the
new
legislative
councils
you
will
be
also
pleased
to
know
that
gulam
nohiuddin
has
resigned
his
honorary
magistrateship
i
hope
that
both
these
patriots
will
not
consider
that
they
have
done
their
last
duty
by
their
acts
of
renunciation
but
i
hope
they
will
regard
their
acts
as
a
prelude
to
acts
of
greater
purpose
and
greater
energy
and
i
hope
they
will
take
in
hand
the
work
of
educating
the
electorate
in
their
districts
regarding
boycott
of
councils
i
have
said
elsewhere
that
never
for
another
century
will
india
be
faced
with
a
conjunction
of
events
that
faces
it
the
cloud
that
has
descended
upon
islam
has
solidified
the
moslem
world
as
nothing
else
could
have
it
has
awakened
the
men
and
women
of
mussulman
india
from
their
deep
sleep
inasmuch
as
a
single
panjabi
was
made
to
crawl
on
his
belly
in
the
famous
street
of
amitsar
i
hold
that
the
whole
of
was
made
to
crawl
on
its
belly
and
if
we
want
to
straighten
up
ourselves
from
that
crawling
position
and
stand
erect
before
the
whole
world
it
requires
a
tremendous
effort
the
viceroy
in
his
viceregal
pronouncement
at
the
opening
of
the
council
was
pleased
to
say
that
he
did
not
desire
to
make
any
remarks
on
the
punjab
events
he
treated
them
as
a
closed
chapter
and
referred
us
to
the
future
verdict
of
history
i
venture
to
tell
you
the
citizens
of
bezwada
that
india
will
have
deserved
to
crawl
in
that
lane
if
she
accepts
this
pronouncement
as
the
final
answer
and
if
we
want
to
stand
erect
before
the
whole
world
it
is
impossible
for
a
single
child
man
or
woman
in
india
to
rest
until
fullest
reparation
has
been
done
for
the
punjab
wrong
similarly
with
reference
to
the
khilafat
grievance
the
mussalmans
of
india
in
my
humble
opinion
will
forfeit
all
title
to
consider
themselves
the
followers
of
the
great
prophet
in
whose
name
they
recite
the
kalama
day
in
and
day
out
they
will
forfeit
their
title
if
they
do
not
put
their
shoulders
to
the
wheel
and
lift
this
cloud
that
is
hanging
on
them
but
we
shall
make
a
serious
blunder
india
will
commit
suicide
if
we
do
not
understand
and
appreciate
the
forces
that
are
arrayed
against
us
we
have
got
to
face
a
mighty
government
with
all
its
power
ranged
against
us
this
composed
of
men
who
are
able
courageous
capable
of
making
sacrifices
it
is
a
government
which
does
not
scruple
to
use
means
fair
or
foul
in
order
to
gain
its
end
no
craft
is
above
that
government
it
resorts
to
frightfulness
terrorism
it
resorts
to
bribery
in
the
shape
of
titles
honour
and
high
offices
it
administers
opiates
in
the
shape
of
reforms
in
essence
then
it
is
an
autocracy
double
distilled
in
the
guise
of
democracy
the
greatest
gift
of
a
crafty
cunning
man
are
worthless
so
long
as
cunning
resides
in
his
heart
it
is
a
government
representing
a
civilisation
which
is
purely
material
and
godless
i
have
given
to
you
these
qualities
of
this
government
in
order
not
to
excite
your
angry
passions
but
in
order
that
you
may
appreciate
the
forces
that
are
matched
against
you
anger
will
serve
no
purpose
we
shall
have
to
meet
ungodliness
by
godliness
we
shall
have
to
meet
their
untruth
by
truth
we
shall
have
to
meet
their
cunning
and
their
craft
by
openness
and
simplicity
we
shall
have
to
meet
their
terrorism
and
frightfulness
by
bravery
and
it
is
an
unbending
bravery
which
is
demanded
of
every
man
woman
and
child
we
must
meet
their
organisation
by
greater
organising
ability
we
must
meet
their
discipline
by
grater
discipline
and
we
must
meet
their
sacrifices
by
infinitely
greater
sacrifices
and
if
we
are
in
a
position
to
show
these
qualities
in
a
full
measure
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
we
shall
win
this
battle
if
really
we
have
fear
of
god
in
us
our
prayers
will
give
us
the
strength
to
secure
victory
god
has
always
come
to
the
help
of
the
helpless
and
we
need
not
go
before
any
earthly
power
for
help
you
heard
this
morning
of
the
bravery
of
the
sword
and
the
bravery
of
suffering
for
me
personally
i
have
forever
rejected
the
bravery
of
the
sword
but
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
demonstrate
to
you
the
final
ineffectiveness
of
the
sword
but
he
who
runs
may
see
that
before
india
possesses
itself
a
sword
which
will
be
more
than
a
match
for
the
forces
of
europe
it
will
he
generations
india
may
resort
to
the
destruction
of
life
and
property
here
and
there
but
such
destructive
cases
serve
no
purpose
i
have
therefore
presented
to
you
a
weapon
called
the
bravery
of
suffering
otherwise
called
it
is
a
bravery
which
is
open
to
the
weakest
among
the
weak
it
is
open
to
women
and
children
the
power
of
suffering
is
the
prerogative
of
nobody
and
if
only
millions
of
indians
could
show
the
power
of
suffering
in
order
to
redress
a
grievous
wrong
done
to
the
nation
or
to
its
religion
i
make
bold
to
say
that
india
will
never
require
to
draw
the
sword
and
unless
we
are
able
to
show
an
adequate
measure
of
sacrifice
we
shall
lose
this
battle
no
one
need
tell
me
that
india
has
not
got
this
power
of
suffering
every
father
and
mother
is
witness
to
what
i
am
about
to
say
that
every
father
and
mother
have
shown
in
the
domestic
affairs
matchless
power
of
suffering
and
if
we
have
only
developed
national
consciousness
if
we
have
developed
sufficient
regard
for
our
religion
we
shall
have
developed
power
of
suffering
in
the
national
and
religious
field
considered
in
these
terms
the
first
stage
in
is
the
simplest
and
the
easiest
state
if
the
of
india
consider
that
india
is
suffering
from
a
grievous
wrong
both
as
regards
the
punjab
and
the
khilafat
is
it
any
suffering
on
their
part
to
renounce
their
titles
what
is
the
measure
of
the
suffering
awaiting
the
lawyers
who
are
called
upon
to
suspend
practice
when
compared
to
the
great
benefit
which
is
in
store
for
the
nation
and
if
thy
parents
of
india
will
summon
up
courage
to
sacrifice
secular
education
they
will
have
given
their
children
the
real
education
of
a
for
they
will
have
learnt
the
value
of
religion
and
national
honour
and
i
ask
you
the
citizens
of
bezwada
to
think
well
before
you
accept
the
loaves
and
fishes
in
the
form
of
government
offices
set
them
on
one
side
and
set
national
honour
on
the
other
and
make
your
service
what
sacrifice
is
there
involved
in
the
individual
renouncing
his
candidature
for
legislative
councils
the
councils
are
a
tempting
bait
all
kinds
of
arguments
are
being
advanced
in
favour
of
joining
the
councils
india
will
sacrifice
the
opportunity
of
gaining
her
liberty
if
she
touches
them
it
passes
comprehension
how
we
who
have
known
this
government
who
have
read
the
viceregal
pronouncement
how
we
who
have
known
their
determination
not
to
give
justice
in
the
punjab
and
the
khilafat
matters
can
gain
any
benefit
by
constructive
or
obstructive
with
this
government
but
the
nationalists
belonging
to
a
great
popular
party
tell
us
that
if
they
do
not
contest
these
scats
the
moderates
will
get
in
surely
it
is
nothing
but
an
exhibition
of
want
of
courage
and
faith
in
our
own
cause
to
feel
that
we
must
enter
the
councils
lest
moderates
should
get
in
moderates
believe
in
the
possibility
of
obtaining
justice
at
the
hands
of
the
government
nationalists
have
on
the
other
hand
filled
the
platforms
with
denunciations
of
the
government
and
its
measures
how
can
the
nationalists
ever
hope
to
gain
anything
by
entering
the
councils
holding
the
belief
that
they
do
they
will
better
represent
the
popular
will
if
they
wring
justice
from
the
government
by
means
of
a
calculating
spirit
at
the
present
moment
in
the
history
of
india
will
prove
its
ruin
i
therefore
tender
my
hearty
congratulation
to
those
who
have
announced
their
resignations
of
candidature
or
honorary
offices
and
i
hope
that
their
example
will
prove
infectious
i
have
been
told
and
i
believe
it
myself
from
what
i
have
seen
that
the
andhrus
are
a
brave
courageous
and
people
i
venture
therefore
to
ask
my
andhra
brethren
whether
they
have
understood
the
spirituality
of
this
beautiful
doctrine
of
if
they
have
i
hope
they
will
not
wait
for
a
single
moment
for
a
mandate
from
the
congress
or
the
moslem
league
they
will
understand
that
a
spiritual
weapon
is
god
whether
it
is
wielded
by
one
or
many
i
therefore
invite
you
to
go
to
calcutta
with
a
united
will
and
a
united
purpose
sanctified
by
a
spirit
of
sacrifice
with
a
will
of
your
own
to
convert
those
who
are
still
undecided
about
the
spirituality
or
the
practicability
of
the
weapon
i
thank
you
for
the
attention
and
patience
with
which
you
have
listened
to
me
i
pray
to
the
almighty
that
he
may
give
you
wisdom
and
courage
that
are
so
necessary
at
the
present
the
congress
the
largest
and
the
most
important
congress
ever
held
has
come
and
gone
it
was
the
biggest
demonstration
ever
held
against
the
present
system
of
government
the
president
uttered
the
whole
truth
when
he
said
that
it
was
a
congress
in
which
instead
of
the
president
and
the
leaders
driving
the
people
the
people
drove
him
and
the
latter
it
was
clear
to
every
one
on
the
platform
that
the
people
had
taken
the
reins
in
their
own
hands
the
platform
would
gladly
have
moved
at
a
slower
pace
the
congress
gave
one
day
to
a
full
discussion
of
the
creed
and
voted
solidly
for
it
with
but
two
dissentients
after
two
nights
sleep
over
the
discussion
it
gave
one
day
to
a
discussion
of
resolution
and
voted
for
it
with
unparalleled
enthusiasm
it
gave
the
last
day
to
listening
to
the
whole
of
the
remaining
articles
of
the
constitution
which
were
read
and
translated
word
for
word
by
maulana
mahomed
ali
in
a
loud
and
clear
voice
it
showed
that
it
was
intelligently
following
the
reading
of
it
for
there
was
dissent
when
article
eight
was
reached
it
referred
to
by
the
congress
in
the
internal
affairs
of
the
native
states
the
congress
would
not
have
passed
the
proviso
if
it
had
meant
that
it
could
even
voice
the
feelings
of
the
people
residing
in
the
territories
ruled
by
the
princes
happily
it
resolution
suggesting
the
advisability
of
establishing
responsible
government
in
their
territories
enabled
me
to
illustrate
to
the
audience
that
the
proviso
did
not
preclude
the
congress
from
ventilating
the
grievances
and
aspirations
of
the
subjects
of
these
states
whilst
it
clearly
prevented
the
congress
from
taking
any
executive
action
in
connection
with
them
as
for
instance
holding
a
hostile
demonstration
in
the
native
states
against
any
action
of
theirs
the
congress
claims
to
dictate
to
the
government
but
it
can
not
do
so
by
the
very
nature
of
its
constitution
in
respect
of
the
native
states
thus
the
congress
has
taken
three
important
steps
after
the
greatest
deliberation
it
has
expressed
its
determination
in
the
clearest
possible
terms
to
attain
complete
if
possible
still
in
association
with
the
british
people
but
even
without
if
necessary
it
proposes
to
do
so
only
by
means
that
are
honourable
and
it
has
introduced
fundamental
changes
in
the
constitution
regulating
its
activities
and
has
performed
an
act
of
in
voluntarily
restricting
the
number
of
delegates
to
one
for
every
fifty
thousand
of
the
population
of
india
and
has
insisted
upon
the
delegates
being
the
real
representatives
of
those
who
want
to
take
any
part
in
the
political
life
of
the
country
and
with
a
view
to
ensuring
the
representation
of
all
political
parties
it
has
accepted
the
principle
of
single
transferable
vote
it
has
reaffirmed
the
resolution
of
the
special
session
and
amplified
it
in
every
respect
it
has
emphasised
the
necessity
of
and
laid
down
that
the
attainment
of
swaraj
is
conditional
upon
the
complete
harmony
between
the
component
parts
of
india
and
has
therefore
inculcated
unity
the
hindu
delegates
have
called
upon
their
leaders
to
settle
disputes
between
brahmins
and
and
have
urged
upon
the
religious
heads
the
necessity
of
getting
rid
of
the
poison
of
untouchability
the
congress
has
told
the
parents
of
children
and
the
lawyers
that
they
have
not
responded
sufficiently
to
the
call
of
the
nation
and
and
that
they
must
make
greater
effort
in
doing
so
it
therefore
follows
that
the
lawyers
who
do
not
respond
quickly
to
the
call
for
suspension
and
the
parents
who
persist
in
keeping
their
children
in
government
and
aided
institutions
must
find
themselves
dropping
out
from
the
public
life
of
the
country
the
country
calls
upon
every
man
and
woman
in
india
to
do
their
full
share
but
of
the
details
of
the
resolution
i
must
write
later
who
is
disloyal
montagu
has
discovered
a
new
definition
of
disloyalty
he
considers
my
suggestion
to
boycott
the
visit
of
the
prince
of
wales
to
be
disloyal
and
some
newspapers
taking
the
cue
from
him
have
called
persons
who
have
made
the
suggestion
they
have
even
attributed
to
these
persons
the
suggestion
of
boycotting
the
prince
i
draw
a
sharp
and
fundamental
distinction
between
boycotting
the
prince
and
boycotting
any
welcome
arranged
for
him
personally
i
would
extend
the
heartiest
welcome
to
his
royal
highness
if
he
came
or
could
come
without
official
patronage
and
the
protecting
wings
of
the
government
of
the
day
being
the
heir
to
a
constitutional
monarch
the
prince
movements
are
regulated
and
dictated
by
the
ministers
no
matter
how
much
the
dictation
may
be
concealed
beneath
diplomatically
polite
language
in
suggesting
the
boycott
therefore
the
promoters
have
suggested
boycott
of
an
insolent
bureaucracy
and
dishonest
ministers
of
his
majesty
you
can
not
have
it
both
ways
it
is
true
that
under
a
constitutional
monarchy
the
royalty
is
above
politics
but
you
can
not
send
the
prince
on
a
political
visit
for
the
purpose
of
making
political
capital
out
of
him
and
then
complain
that
those
who
will
not
play
your
game
and
in
order
to
checkmate
you
proclaim
boycott
of
the
royal
visit
do
not
know
constitutional
usage
for
the
prince
visit
is
not
for
pleasure
his
royal
highness
is
to
come
in
lloyd
george
words
as
the
ambassador
of
the
british
nation
in
other
words
his
own
ambassador
in
order
to
issue
a
certificate
of
merit
to
him
and
possibly
to
give
the
ministers
a
new
lease
of
life
the
wish
is
designed
to
consolidate
and
strengthen
a
power
that
spells
mischief
for
india
even
us
it
is
montagu
has
foreseen
that
the
welcome
will
probably
be
excelled
by
any
hitherto
extended
to
royalty
meaning
that
the
people
are
not
really
and
deeply
affected
and
stirred
by
the
official
atrocities
in
the
punjab
and
the
manifestly
dishonest
breach
of
official
declarations
on
the
khilafat
with
the
knowledge
that
india
was
bleeding
at
heart
the
government
of
india
should
have
told
his
majesty
ministers
that
the
moment
was
inopportune
for
sending
the
prince
i
venture
to
submit
that
it
is
adding
insult
to
injury
to
bring
the
prince
and
through
his
visit
to
steal
honours
and
further
prestige
for
a
government
that
deserves
to
be
dismissed
with
disgrace
i
claim
that
i
prove
my
loyalty
by
saying
that
india
is
in
no
mood
is
too
deeply
in
mourning
to
take
part
in
and
to
welcome
his
royal
highness
and
that
the
ministers
and
the
indian
government
show
their
disloyalty
by
making
the
prince
a
catspaw
of
their
deep
political
game
if
they
persist
it
is
the
clear
duty
of
india
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
visit
crusade
against
i
have
most
carefully
read
the
manifesto
addressed
by
sir
narayan
chandavarkar
and
others
dissuading
the
people
from
joining
the
non
movement
i
had
expected
to
find
some
solid
argument
against
but
to
my
great
regret
i
have
found
in
it
nothing
but
distortion
no
doubt
unconscious
of
the
great
religions
and
history
the
manifesto
says
that
is
deprecated
by
the
religious
tenets
and
traditions
of
our
motherland
nay
of
all
the
religions
that
have
saved
and
elevated
the
human
race
i
venture
to
submit
that
the
bhagwad
gita
is
a
gospel
of
between
forces
of
darkness
and
those
of
light
if
it
is
to
be
literally
interpreted
arjun
representing
a
just
cause
was
enjoined
to
engage
in
bloody
warfare
with
the
unjust
kauravas
tulsidas
advises
the
sant
the
good
to
shun
the
asant
the
the
zendavesta
represents
a
perpetual
dual
between
ormuzd
and
ahriman
between
whom
there
is
no
compromise
to
say
of
the
bible
that
it
taboos
is
not
to
know
jesus
a
prince
among
passive
resisters
who
uncompromisingly
challenged
the
might
of
the
sadducees
and
the
pharisees
and
for
the
sake
of
truth
did
not
hesitate
to
divide
sons
from
their
parents
and
what
did
the
prophet
of
islam
do
he
in
mecca
in
a
most
active
manner
so
long
as
his
life
was
not
in
danger
and
wiped
the
dust
of
mecca
off
his
feet
when
he
found
that
he
and
his
followers
might
have
uselessly
to
perish
and
fled
to
medina
and
returned
when
he
was
strong
enough
to
give
battle
to
his
opponents
the
duty
of
with
unjust
men
and
kings
is
as
strictly
enjoined
by
all
the
religions
as
is
the
duty
of
with
just
men
and
kings
indeed
most
of
the
scriptures
of
the
world
seem
even
to
go
beyond
and
prefer
a
violence
to
effeminate
submission
to
a
wrong
the
hindu
religious
tradition
of
which
the
manifesto
speaks
clearly
proves
the
duty
of
prahlad
dissociated
himself
from
his
father
meerabai
from
her
husband
bibhishan
from
his
brutal
brother
the
manifesto
speaking
of
the
secular
aspect
says
history
of
nations
affords
no
instance
to
show
that
it
meaning
has
when
employed
succeeded
and
done
good
one
most
recent
instance
of
brilliant
success
of
is
that
of
general
botha
who
boycotted
lord
milner
reformed
councils
and
thereby
procured
a
perfect
constitution
for
his
country
the
dukhobours
of
russia
offered
and
a
handful
though
they
were
their
grievances
so
deeply
moved
the
civilized
world
that
canada
offered
them
a
home
where
they
form
a
prosperous
community
in
india
instances
can
be
given
by
the
dozen
in
which
in
little
principalities
the
raiyats
when
deeply
grieved
by
their
chiefs
have
cut
off
all
connection
with
them
and
bent
them
to
their
will
i
know
of
no
instance
in
history
where
has
failed
hitherto
i
have
given
historical
instances
of
bloodless
i
will
not
insult
the
intelligence
of
the
reader
by
citing
historical
instances
of
combined
with
violence
but
i
am
free
to
confess
that
there
are
on
record
as
many
successes
as
failures
in
violent
and
it
is
because
i
know
this
fact
that
i
have
placed
before
the
country
a
scheme
in
which
if
at
all
worked
satisfactorily
success
is
a
certainty
and
in
which
means
no
harm
for
if
even
one
man
say
by
resigning
some
office
he
has
gained
not
lost
that
is
its
ethical
or
religious
aspect
for
its
political
result
naturally
it
requires
polymerous
support
i
fear
therefore
no
disastrous
result
from
save
for
an
outbreak
of
violence
on
the
part
of
the
people
whether
under
provocation
or
otherwise
i
would
risk
violence
a
thousand
times
than
risk
the
emasculation
of
a
whole
race
speech
at
muzaffarabad
before
a
crowded
meeting
of
mussalmans
in
the
muzaffarabad
bombay
held
on
the
july
speaking
on
the
impending
which
commenced
on
the
of
august
gandhi
said
the
time
for
speeches
on
was
past
and
the
time
for
practice
had
arrived
but
two
things
were
needful
for
complete
success
an
environment
free
from
any
violence
on
the
part
of
the
people
and
a
spirit
of
as
the
speaker
had
conceived
it
was
an
impossibility
in
an
atmosphere
surcharged
with
the
spirit
of
violence
violence
was
an
exhibition
of
anger
and
any
such
exhibition
was
dissipation
of
valuable
energy
subduing
of
one
anger
was
a
storing
up
of
national
energy
which
when
set
free
in
an
ordered
manner
would
produce
astounding
results
his
conception
of
did
not
involve
rapine
plunder
incendiarism
and
all
the
concomitants
of
mass
madness
his
scheme
presupposed
ability
on
their
part
to
control
all
the
forces
of
evil
if
therefore
any
disorderliness
was
found
on
the
part
of
the
people
which
they
could
not
control
he
for
one
would
certainly
help
the
government
to
control
them
in
the
presence
of
disorder
it
would
be
for
him
a
choice
of
evil
and
evil
through
he
considered
the
present
government
to
be
he
would
not
hesitate
for
the
time
being
to
help
the
government
to
control
disorder
but
he
had
faith
in
the
people
he
believed
that
they
knew
that
the
cause
could
only
be
won
by
methods
to
put
it
at
the
lowest
the
people
had
not
the
power
even
if
they
had
the
will
to
resist
with
brute
strength
the
unjust
governments
of
europe
who
had
in
the
intoxication
of
their
success
disregarding
every
canon
of
justice
dealt
so
cruelly
by
the
only
islamic
power
in
europe
in
they
had
a
matchless
and
powerful
weapon
it
was
a
sign
of
religious
atrophy
to
sustain
an
unjust
government
that
supported
an
injustice
by
resorting
to
untruth
and
camouflage
so
long
therefore
as
the
government
did
not
purge
itself
of
the
canker
of
injustice
and
untruth
it
was
their
duty
to
withdraw
all
help
from
it
consistently
with
their
ability
to
preserve
order
in
the
social
structure
the
first
stage
of
was
therefore
arranged
so
as
to
involve
minimum
of
danger
to
public
peace
and
minimum
of
sacrifice
on
the
part
of
those
who
participated
in
the
movement
and
if
they
might
not
help
an
evil
government
nor
receive
any
favours
from
it
it
followed
that
they
must
give
up
all
titles
of
honour
which
were
no
longer
a
proud
possession
lawyers
who
were
in
reality
honorary
officers
of
the
court
should
cease
to
support
courts
that
uphold
the
prestige
of
an
unjust
government
and
the
people
must
be
able
to
settle
their
disputes
and
quarrels
by
private
arbitration
similarly
parents
should
withdraw
their
children
from
the
public
schools
and
they
must
evolve
a
system
of
national
education
or
private
education
totally
independent
of
the
government
an
insolent
government
conscious
of
its
brute
strength
might
laugh
at
such
withdrawals
by
the
people
especially
as
the
law
courts
and
schools
were
supposed
to
help
the
people
but
he
had
not
a
shadow
of
doubt
that
the
moral
effect
of
such
a
step
could
not
possibly
be
lost
even
upon
a
government
whose
conscience
had
become
stifled
by
the
intoxication
of
power
he
had
hesitation
in
accepting
swadeshi
as
a
plank
in
to
him
swadeshi
was
as
dear
as
life
itself
but
he
had
no
desire
to
smuggle
in
swadeshi
through
the
khilafat
movement
if
it
could
not
legitimately
help
that
movement
but
conceived
as
was
in
a
spirit
of
swadeshi
had
a
legitimate
place
in
the
movement
pure
swadeshi
meant
sacrifice
of
the
liking
for
fineries
he
asked
the
nation
to
sacrifice
its
liking
for
the
fineries
of
europe
and
japan
and
be
satisfied
with
the
coarse
but
beautiful
fabrics
woven
on
their
handlooms
out
of
yarns
spun
by
millions
of
their
sisters
if
the
nation
had
become
really
awakened
to
a
sense
of
the
danger
to
its
religions
and
its
it
could
not
but
perceive
the
absolute
and
immediate
necessity
of
the
adoption
of
swadeshi
in
its
intense
form
and
if
the
people
of
india
adopted
swadeshi
with
the
religious
zeal
he
begged
to
assure
them
that
its
adoption
would
arm
them
with
a
new
power
and
would
produce
an
unmistakable
impression
throughout
the
whole
world
he
therefore
expected
the
mussalmans
to
give
the
lead
by
giving
up
all
the
fineries
they
were
so
fond
of
and
adopt
the
simple
cloth
that
could
be
produced
by
the
manual
labour
of
their
sisters
and
brethren
in
their
own
cottages
and
he
hoped
that
the
hindus
would
follow
suit
it
was
a
sacrifice
in
which
the
whole
nation
every
man
woman
and
child
could
take
part
ridicule
replacing
repression
had
his
excellency
the
viceroy
not
made
it
impossible
by
his
defiant
attitude
on
the
punjab
and
the
khilafat
i
would
have
tendered
him
hearty
congratulations
for
substituting
ridicule
for
repression
in
order
to
kill
a
movement
distasteful
to
him
for
torn
from
its
context
and
read
by
itself
his
excellency
discourse
on
is
unexceptionable
it
is
a
symptom
of
translation
from
savagery
to
civilization
pouring
ridicule
on
one
opponent
is
an
approved
method
in
civilised
politics
and
if
the
method
is
consistently
continued
it
will
mark
an
important
improvement
upon
the
official
barbarity
of
the
punjab
his
interpretation
of
montagu
statement
about
the
movement
is
also
not
open
to
any
objection
whatsoever
without
doubt
a
government
has
the
right
to
use
sufficient
force
to
put
down
an
actual
outbreak
of
violence
but
i
regret
to
have
to
confess
that
this
attempt
to
pour
ridicule
on
the
movement
read
in
conjunction
with
the
sentiments
on
the
punjab
and
the
khilafat
preceding
the
ridicule
seems
to
show
that
his
excellency
has
made
it
a
virtue
of
necessity
he
has
not
finally
abandoned
the
method
of
terrorism
and
frightfulness
but
he
finds
the
movement
being
conducted
in
such
an
open
and
truthful
manner
that
any
attempt
to
kill
it
by
violent
repression
would
not
expose
him
not
only
to
ridicule
but
contempt
of
all
men
let
us
however
examine
the
adjectives
used
by
his
excellency
to
kill
the
movement
by
laughing
at
it
it
is
insane
he
has
rounded
off
the
adjectives
by
describing
the
movement
as
foolish
of
all
foolish
schemes
his
excellency
has
become
so
impatient
of
it
that
he
has
used
all
his
vocabulary
for
showing
the
magnitude
of
the
ridiculous
nature
of
unfortunately
for
his
excellency
the
movement
is
likely
to
grow
with
ridicule
as
it
is
certain
to
flourish
on
repression
no
vital
movement
can
be
killed
except
by
the
impatience
ignorance
or
laziness
of
its
authors
a
movement
can
not
be
that
is
conducted
by
men
of
action
as
i
claim
the
members
of
the
committee
are
it
is
hardly
seeing
that
if
the
people
respond
every
one
admits
that
it
will
achieve
the
end
at
the
same
time
it
is
perfectly
true
that
if
there
is
no
response
from
the
people
the
movement
will
be
popularly
described
as
it
is
for
the
nation
to
return
an
effective
answer
by
organised
and
change
ridicule
into
respect
ridicule
is
like
repression
both
give
place
to
respect
when
they
fail
to
produce
the
intended
effect
the
viceregal
pronouncement
it
may
be
that
having
lost
faith
in
his
excellency
probity
and
capacity
to
hold
the
high
office
of
viceroy
of
india
i
now
read
his
speeches
with
a
biased
mind
but
the
speech
his
excellency
delivered
at
the
time
of
opening
of
the
council
shows
to
me
a
mental
attitude
which
makes
association
with
him
or
his
government
impossible
for
men
the
remarks
on
the
punjab
mean
a
flat
refusal
to
grant
redress
he
would
have
us
to
on
the
problems
of
the
immediate
future
the
immediate
future
is
to
compel
repentance
on
the
part
of
the
government
on
the
punjab
matter
of
this
there
is
no
sign
on
the
contrary
his
excellency
resists
the
temptation
to
reply
to
his
critics
meaning
thereby
that
he
has
not
changed
his
opinion
on
the
many
vital
matters
affecting
the
honour
of
india
he
is
to
leave
the
issues
to
the
verdict
of
history
now
this
kind
of
language
in
my
opinion
is
calculated
further
to
inflame
the
indian
mind
of
what
use
can
a
favourable
verdict
of
history
be
to
men
who
have
been
wronged
and
who
are
still
under
the
heels
of
officers
who
have
shown
themselves
utterly
unfit
to
hold
offices
of
trust
and
responsibility
the
plea
for
is
to
say
the
least
hypocritical
in
the
face
of
the
determination
to
refuse
justice
to
the
punjab
can
a
patient
who
is
suffering
from
an
intolerable
ache
be
soothed
by
the
most
tempting
dishes
placed
before
him
will
he
not
consider
it
mockery
on
the
part
of
the
physician
who
so
tempted
him
without
curing
him
of
his
pain
his
excellency
is
if
possible
even
less
happy
on
the
khilafat
so
far
as
any
government
could
says
this
trustee
for
the
nation
we
pressed
upon
the
peace
conference
the
views
of
indian
moslems
but
notwithstanding
our
efforts
on
their
behalf
we
are
threatened
with
a
campaign
of
because
forsooth
the
allied
powers
found
themselves
unable
to
accept
the
contentions
advanced
by
indian
moslems
this
is
most
misleading
if
not
untruthful
his
excellency
knows
that
the
peace
terms
are
not
the
work
of
the
allied
powers
he
knows
that
lloyd
george
is
the
prime
author
of
terms
and
that
the
latter
has
never
repudiated
his
responsibility
for
them
he
has
with
amazing
audacity
justified
them
in
spite
of
his
considered
pledge
to
the
moslems
of
india
regarding
constantinople
thrace
and
the
rich
and
renowned
lands
of
asia
minor
it
is
not
truthful
to
saddle
responsibility
for
the
terms
on
the
allied
powers
when
great
britain
alone
has
promoted
them
the
offence
of
the
viceroy
becomes
greater
when
we
remember
that
he
admits
the
justness
of
the
muslim
claim
he
could
not
have
it
if
he
did
not
admit
its
justice
i
venture
to
think
that
his
excellency
by
his
pronouncement
on
the
punjab
has
strengthened
the
nation
in
its
efforts
to
seek
a
remedy
to
compel
redress
of
the
two
wrongs
before
it
can
make
anything
of
the
reforms
from
ridicule
to
it
will
be
admitted
that
has
passed
the
stage
ridicule
whether
it
will
now
be
met
by
repression
or
respect
remains
to
be
seen
opinion
has
already
been
expressed
in
these
columns
that
ridicule
is
an
approved
and
civilized
method
of
opposition
the
viceregal
ridicule
though
expressed
in
unnecessarily
impolite
terms
was
not
open
to
exception
but
the
testing
time
has
now
arrived
in
a
civilized
country
when
ridicule
fails
to
kill
a
movement
it
begins
to
command
respect
opponents
meet
it
by
respectful
and
cogent
argument
and
the
mutual
behaviour
of
rival
parties
never
becomes
violent
each
party
seeks
to
convert
the
other
or
draw
the
uncertain
element
towards
its
side
by
pure
argument
and
reasoning
there
is
little
doubt
now
that
the
boycott
of
the
councils
will
be
extensive
if
it
is
not
complete
the
students
have
become
disturbed
important
institutions
may
any
day
become
truly
national
pandit
motilal
nehru
great
renunciation
of
a
legal
practice
which
was
probably
second
to
nobody
is
by
itself
an
event
calculated
to
change
ridicule
into
respect
it
ought
to
set
people
thinking
seriously
about
their
own
attitude
there
must
be
something
very
wrong
about
our
government
to
warrant
the
step
pundit
motilal
nehru
has
taken
post
graduate
students
have
given
up
their
fellowships
medical
students
have
refused
to
appear
for
their
final
examination
in
these
circumstances
can
not
be
called
an
inane
movement
either
the
government
must
bend
to
the
will
of
the
people
which
is
being
expressed
in
no
unmistakable
terms
through
or
it
must
attempt
to
crush
the
movement
by
repression
any
force
used
by
a
government
under
any
circumstance
is
not
repression
an
open
trial
of
a
person
accused
of
having
advocated
methods
of
violence
is
not
repression
every
state
has
the
right
to
put
down
or
prevent
violence
by
force
but
the
trial
of
zafar
ali
khan
and
two
moulvis
of
panipat
shows
that
the
government
is
seeking
not
to
put
down
or
prevent
violence
but
to
suppress
expression
of
opinion
to
prevent
the
spread
of
disaffection
this
is
repression
the
trials
are
the
beginning
of
it
it
has
not
still
assumed
a
virulent
form
but
if
these
trials
do
not
result
in
stilling
the
propaganda
it
is
highly
likely
that
severe
repression
will
be
resorted
to
by
the
government
the
only
other
way
to
prevent
the
spread
of
disaffection
is
to
remove
the
causes
thereof
and
that
would
be
to
respect
the
growing
response
of
the
country
to
the
programme
of
it
is
too
much
to
expect
repentance
and
humility
from
a
government
intoxicated
with
success
and
power
we
must
therefore
assume
that
the
second
stage
in
the
government
programme
will
be
repression
growing
in
violence
in
the
same
ratio
as
the
progress
of
and
if
the
movement
survives
repression
the
day
of
victory
of
truth
is
near
we
must
then
be
prepared
for
prosecutions
punishments
even
up
to
deportations
we
must
evolve
the
capacity
for
going
on
with
our
programme
without
the
leaders
that
means
capacity
for
and
as
no
government
in
the
world
can
possibly
put
a
whole
nation
in
prison
it
must
yield
to
its
demand
or
abdication
in
favour
of
a
government
suited
to
that
nation
it
is
clear
that
abstention
from
violence
and
persistence
in
the
programme
are
our
only
and
surest
chance
of
attaining
our
end
the
government
has
its
choice
either
to
respect
the
movement
or
to
try
to
repress
it
by
barbarous
methods
our
choice
is
either
to
succumb
to
repression
or
to
continue
in
spite
of
repression
to
every
englishman
in
india
dear
friend
i
wish
that
every
englishman
will
see
this
appeal
and
give
thoughtful
attention
to
it
let
me
introduce
myself
to
you
in
my
humble
opinion
no
indian
has
with
the
british
government
more
than
i
have
for
an
unbroken
period
of
years
of
public
life
in
the
face
of
circumstances
that
might
well
have
turned
any
other
man
into
a
rebel
i
ask
you
to
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
my
was
not
based
on
the
fear
of
the
punishments
provided
by
your
laws
or
any
other
selfish
motives
it
was
free
and
voluntary
based
on
the
belief
that
the
sum
total
of
the
activity
of
the
british
government
was
for
the
benefit
of
india
i
put
my
life
in
peril
four
times
for
the
sake
of
the
empire
at
the
time
of
the
boer
war
when
i
was
in
charge
of
the
ambulance
corps
whose
work
was
mentioned
in
general
buller
dispatches
at
the
time
of
the
zulu
revolt
in
natal
when
i
was
in
charge
of
a
similar
corps
at
the
time
of
the
commencement
of
the
late
war
when
i
raised
an
ambulance
corps
and
as
a
result
of
the
strenuous
training
had
a
severe
attack
of
pleurisy
and
lastly
in
fulfilment
of
my
promise
to
lord
chelmsford
at
the
war
conference
in
delhi
i
threw
myself
in
such
an
active
recruiting
campaign
in
kuira
district
involving
long
and
trying
marches
that
i
had
an
attack
of
dysentry
which
proved
almost
fatal
i
did
all
this
in
the
full
belief
that
acts
such
as
mine
must
gain
for
my
country
an
equal
status
in
the
empire
so
late
as
last
december
i
pleaded
hard
for
a
trustful
i
fully
believed
that
lloyd
george
would
redeem
his
promise
to
the
mussalmans
and
that
the
revelations
of
the
official
atrocities
in
the
punjab
would
secure
full
reparation
for
the
punjabis
but
the
treachery
of
lloyd
george
and
its
appreciation
by
you
and
the
condonation
of
the
punjab
atrocities
have
completely
shattered
my
faith
in
the
good
intentions
of
the
government
and
the
nation
which
is
supporting
it
but
though
my
faith
in
your
good
intentions
is
gone
i
recognise
your
bravery
and
i
know
that
what
you
will
not
yield
to
justice
and
reason
you
will
gladly
yield
to
bravery
what
this
empire
means
to
exploitation
of
india
resources
for
the
benefit
of
great
britain
an
military
expenditure
and
a
civil
service
the
most
expensive
in
the
world
extravagant
working
of
every
department
in
utter
disregard
of
poverty
disarmament
and
consequent
emasculation
of
a
whole
nation
lest
an
armed
nation
might
imperil
the
lives
of
a
handful
of
you
in
our
midst
traffic
in
intoxicating
liquors
and
drugs
for
the
purposes
of
sustaining
a
top
heavy
administration
progressively
representative
legislation
in
order
to
suppress
an
evergrowing
agitation
seeking
to
give
expression
to
a
nation
agony
degrading
treatment
of
indians
residing
in
your
dominions
and
you
have
shown
total
disregard
of
our
feelings
by
glorifying
the
punjab
administration
and
flouting
the
mosulman
sentiment
i
know
you
would
not
mind
if
we
could
fight
and
wrest
the
sceptre
form
your
hands
you
know
that
we
are
powerless
to
do
that
for
you
have
ensured
our
incapacity
to
fight
in
open
and
honourable
battle
bravery
on
the
battlefield
is
thus
impossible
for
us
bravery
of
the
soul
still
remains
open
to
us
i
know
you
will
respond
to
that
also
i
am
engaged
in
evoking
that
bravery
means
nothing
less
than
training
in
why
should
we
with
you
when
we
know
that
by
your
administration
of
this
great
country
we
are
lifting
daily
enslaved
in
an
increasing
degree
this
response
of
the
people
to
my
appeal
is
not
due
to
my
personality
i
would
like
you
to
dismiss
me
and
for
that
matter
the
ali
brothers
too
from
your
consideration
my
personality
will
fail
to
evoke
any
response
to
cry
if
i
were
foolish
enough
to
rise
it
as
the
magic
name
of
the
ali
brothers
would
fail
to
inspire
the
mussalmans
with
enthusiasm
if
they
were
madly
to
raise
in
cry
people
flock
in
their
thousands
to
listen
to
us
because
we
represent
the
voice
of
a
nation
groaning
under
iron
heels
the
ali
brothers
were
your
friends
as
i
was
and
still
am
my
religion
forbids
me
to
bear
any
towards
you
i
would
not
raise
my
hand
against
you
even
if
i
had
the
power
i
expect
to
conquer
you
only
by
my
suffering
the
ali
brothers
will
certainly
draw
the
sword
if
they
could
in
defence
of
their
religion
and
their
country
but
they
and
i
have
made
common
cause
with
the
people
of
india
in
their
attempt
to
voice
their
feelings
and
to
find
a
remedy
for
their
distress
you
are
in
search
of
a
remedy
to
suppress
this
rising
ebullition
of
national
feeling
i
venture
to
suggest
to
you
that
the
only
way
to
suppress
it
is
to
remove
the
causes
you
have
yet
the
power
you
can
repent
of
the
wrongs
done
to
indians
you
can
compel
lloyd
george
to
redeem
his
promises
i
assure
you
he
has
kept
many
escape
doors
you
can
compel
the
viceroy
to
retire
in
favour
of
a
better
one
you
can
revise
your
ideas
about
sir
michael
and
general
dyer
you
can
compel
the
government
to
summon
a
conference
of
the
recognised
lenders
of
the
people
duly
elected
by
them
and
representing
all
shades
of
opinion
so
as
to
devise
means
for
granting
in
accordance
with
the
wishes
of
the
people
of
india
but
this
you
can
not
do
unless
you
consider
every
indian
to
be
in
reality
your
equal
and
brother
i
ask
for
no
patronage
i
merely
point
out
to
you
as
a
friend
as
honourable
solution
of
a
grave
problem
the
other
solution
namely
repression
is
open
to
you
i
prophesy
that
it
will
fail
it
has
begun
already
the
government
has
already
imprisoned
two
brave
men
of
panipat
for
holding
and
expressing
their
opinions
freely
another
is
on
his
trial
in
lahore
for
having
expressed
similar
opinion
one
in
the
oudh
district
is
already
imprisoned
another
awaits
judgment
you
should
know
what
is
going
on
in
your
midst
our
propaganda
is
being
carried
on
in
anticipation
of
repression
i
invite
you
respectfully
to
choose
the
better
way
and
make
common
cause
with
the
people
of
india
whose
salt
you
are
eating
to
seek
to
thwart
their
inspirations
is
disloyalty
to
the
country
i
am
your
faithful
friend
gandhi
one
step
enough
for
me
stokes
is
a
christian
who
wants
to
follow
the
light
that
god
gives
him
he
has
adopted
india
as
his
home
he
is
watching
the
movement
from
the
kotgarh
hills
where
he
is
living
in
isolation
from
the
india
of
the
plains
and
serving
the
hillmen
he
has
contributed
three
articles
on
to
the
columns
of
the
servant
of
calcutta
and
other
papers
i
had
the
pleasure
of
reading
them
during
my
bengal
tour
stokes
approves
of
but
dreads
the
consequences
that
may
follow
complete
success
evacuation
of
india
by
the
british
he
conjures
up
before
his
mind
a
picture
of
india
invaded
by
the
afghans
from
the
plundered
by
the
gurkhas
from
the
hills
for
me
i
say
with
cardinal
newman
do
not
ask
to
see
the
distant
scene
one
step
enough
for
me
the
movement
is
essentially
religious
the
business
of
every
man
is
to
dissociate
himself
from
evil
in
total
disregard
of
consequences
he
must
have
faith
in
a
good
deed
producing
only
a
good
result
that
in
my
opinion
is
the
gita
doctrine
of
work
without
attachment
god
does
not
permit
him
to
peep
into
the
future
he
follows
truth
although
the
following
of
it
may
endanger
his
very
life
he
knows
that
it
is
better
to
die
in
the
way
of
god
than
to
live
in
the
way
of
satan
therefore
who
ever
is
satisfied
that
this
government
represents
the
activity
of
satan
has
no
choice
left
to
him
but
to
dissociate
himself
from
it
however
let
us
consider
the
worst
that
can
happen
to
india
on
a
sudden
evacuation
of
india
by
the
british
what
does
it
matter
that
the
gurkhas
and
the
pathans
attack
us
surely
we
would
be
better
able
to
deal
with
their
violence
than
we
are
with
the
continued
violence
moral
and
physical
perpetrated
by
the
present
government
stokes
does
not
seem
to
eschew
the
use
of
physical
force
surely
the
combined
labour
of
the
rajput
the
sikh
and
the
mussalman
warriors
in
a
united
india
may
be
trusted
to
deal
with
plunderers
from
any
or
all
the
sides
imagine
however
the
worst
japan
overwhelming
us
from
the
bay
of
bengal
the
gurkhas
from
the
hills
and
the
pathans
from
the
if
we
not
succeed
in
driving
them
out
we
make
terms
with
them
and
drive
them
at
the
first
opportunity
this
will
be
a
more
manly
course
than
a
hopeless
submission
to
an
admittedly
wrongful
state
but
i
refuse
to
contemplate
the
dismal
if
the
movement
succeeds
through
and
that
is
the
supposition
stokes
has
started
with
the
english
whether
they
remain
or
retire
they
will
do
so
as
friends
and
under
a
agreement
as
between
partners
i
still
believe
in
the
goodness
of
human
nature
whether
it
is
english
or
any
other
i
therefore
do
not
believe
that
the
english
will
leave
in
a
night
and
do
i
consider
the
gurkha
and
the
afghan
being
incorrigible
thieves
and
robbers
without
ability
to
respond
to
purifying
influences
i
do
not
if
india
returns
to
her
spirituality
it
will
react
upon
the
neighbouring
tribes
she
will
interest
herself
in
the
welfare
of
these
hardy
but
poor
people
and
even
support
them
if
necessary
not
out
of
fear
but
as
a
matter
of
neighbourly
duty
she
will
have
dealt
with
japan
simultaneously
with
the
british
japan
will
not
want
to
invade
india
if
india
has
learnt
to
consider
it
a
sin
to
use
a
single
foreign
article
that
she
can
manufacture
within
her
own
borders
she
produces
enough
to
eat
and
her
men
and
women
can
without
difficulty
manufacture
enough
to
clothe
to
cover
their
nakedness
and
protect
themselves
from
heat
and
cold
we
become
prey
to
invasion
if
we
excite
the
greed
of
foreign
nation
by
dealing
with
them
under
a
feeling
dependence
on
them
we
must
learn
to
be
independent
of
every
one
of
them
whether
therefore
we
finally
succeed
through
violence
or
in
my
opinion
the
prospect
is
by
no
means
so
gloomy
as
stokes
has
imagined
any
conceivable
prospect
is
in
my
opinion
less
black
than
the
present
unmanly
and
helpless
condition
and
we
can
not
do
better
than
following
out
fearlessly
and
with
confidence
the
open
and
honourable
programme
of
and
sacrifice
that
we
have
mapped
for
ourselves
the
need
for
humility
the
spirit
of
necessarily
leads
to
humility
means
reliance
on
god
the
rocks
of
ages
if
we
would
seek
his
aid
we
must
approach
him
with
a
humble
and
a
contrite
heart
may
not
trade
upon
their
amazing
success
at
the
congress
we
must
act
even
as
the
mango
tree
which
drops
as
it
bears
fruit
its
grandeur
lies
in
its
majestic
lowliness
but
one
hears
of
being
insolent
and
intolerant
in
their
behaviour
towards
those
who
differ
from
them
i
know
that
they
will
lose
all
their
majesty
and
glory
if
they
betray
any
inflation
whilst
we
may
not
be
dissatisfied
with
the
progress
made
so
far
we
have
little
to
our
credit
to
make
us
feel
proud
we
have
to
sacrifice
much
more
than
we
have
done
to
justify
pride
much
less
elation
thousands
who
flocked
to
the
congress
pandal
have
undoubtedly
given
their
intellectual
assent
to
the
doctrine
but
few
have
followed
it
out
in
practice
leaving
aside
the
pleaders
how
many
parents
have
withdrawn
their
children
from
schools
how
many
of
those
who
registered
their
vote
in
favour
of
have
taken
to
or
discarded
the
use
of
all
foreign
cloth
is
not
a
movement
of
brag
bluster
or
bluff
it
is
a
test
of
our
sincerity
it
requires
solid
and
silent
it
challenges
our
honesty
and
our
capacity
for
national
work
it
is
a
movement
that
aims
at
translating
ideas
into
action
and
the
more
we
do
the
more
we
find
that
much
more
must
be
done
than
we
have
expected
and
this
thought
of
our
imperfection
must
make
us
humble
a
strives
to
compel
attention
and
to
set
an
example
not
by
his
violence
but
by
his
unobtrusive
humility
he
allows
his
solid
action
to
speak
for
his
creed
his
strength
lies
in
his
reliance
upon
the
correctness
of
his
position
and
the
conviction
of
it
grows
most
in
his
opponent
when
he
least
interposes
his
speech
between
his
action
and
his
opponent
speech
especially
when
it
is
haughty
betrays
want
of
confidence
and
it
makes
one
opponent
sceptical
about
the
reality
of
the
act
itself
humility
therefore
is
the
key
to
quick
success
i
hope
that
every
will
recognise
the
necessity
of
being
humble
and
it
is
because
so
little
is
really
required
to
be
done
because
all
of
that
little
depends
entirely
upon
ourselves
that
i
have
ventured
the
belief
that
swaraj
is
attainable
in
less
than
one
year
some
questions
answered
i
write
to
thank
you
for
yours
of
the
instant
and
especially
for
your
request
that
i
should
after
reading
your
writings
in
young
india
on
give
a
full
and
frank
criticism
of
them
i
know
that
your
sole
desire
is
to
find
out
the
truth
and
to
act
accordingly
and
hence
i
venture
to
make
the
following
remarks
in
the
issue
of
may
you
say
that
is
not
even
but
surely
to
refuse
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
government
to
the
extent
of
not
serving
it
and
of
not
paying
its
taxes
is
actually
if
not
theoretically
and
such
a
course
must
ultimately
make
all
government
impossible
again
you
say
it
is
the
inherent
right
of
a
subject
to
refuse
to
assist
a
government
that
will
not
listen
to
him
leaving
aside
the
question
of
the
ethical
soundness
of
this
proposition
may
i
ask
which
government
in
the
present
case
has
not
the
indian
government
done
all
it
possibly
can
in
the
matter
then
if
its
attempts
to
voice
the
request
of
india
should
fail
would
it
be
fair
and
just
to
do
anything
against
it
would
not
the
proper
course
be
with
the
supreme
council
of
the
allies
including
great
britain
if
it
be
found
that
the
latter
has
failed
properly
to
support
the
demand
of
the
indian
government
and
people
it
seems
to
me
that
in
all
your
writings
and
speeches
you
forget
that
in
the
present
question
both
government
and
people
are
as
one
and
if
they
fail
to
get
what
they
justly
want
how
does
the
question
of
arise
hindus
and
englishmen
and
the
government
are
all
at
present
shouldering
in
a
manner
the
burden
that
muhomedans
of
india
are
carrying
etc
etc
but
supposing
we
fail
of
our
object
what
then
are
we
all
to
refuse
to
and
with
whom
might
i
recommend
the
consideration
of
the
following
course
of
conduct
wait
and
see
what
the
actual
terms
of
the
treaty
with
turkey
are
if
they
are
not
in
accordance
with
the
aspirations
and
recommendations
of
the
government
and
the
people
of
india
the
every
legitimate
effort
should
be
made
to
have
the
terms
revised
to
the
bitter
end
with
a
government
that
with
us
and
only
when
it
refuses
go
in
for
so
far
i
personally
see
no
reason
whatsoever
for
with
the
indian
government
and
till
it
fails
to
voice
the
needs
and
demands
of
india
as
a
whole
there
can
be
no
reason
the
indian
government
does
some
times
make
mistakes
but
in
the
khilafat
matter
it
is
sound
and
therefore
deserves
or
ought
to
have
the
sympathetic
and
of
every
one
in
india
i
hope
that
you
will
kindly
consider
the
above
and
perhaps
you
will
be
able
to
find
time
for
a
reply
in
i
gladly
make
room
for
the
above
letter
and
respond
to
the
suggestion
to
give
a
public
reply
as
no
doubt
the
difficulty
experienced
by
the
english
friend
is
experienced
by
many
causes
are
generally
lost
not
owing
to
the
determined
opposition
of
men
who
will
not
see
the
truth
as
they
want
to
perpetuate
an
injustice
but
because
they
are
able
to
enlist
in
their
favour
the
allegiance
of
those
who
are
anxious
to
understand
a
particular
cause
and
take
sides
after
mature
judgment
it
is
only
by
patient
argument
with
such
honest
men
that
one
is
able
to
check
oneself
correct
one
own
errors
of
judgment
and
at
times
to
wean
them
from
their
error
and
bring
them
over
to
one
side
this
khilafat
question
is
specially
difficult
because
there
are
so
many
it
is
therefore
no
wonder
that
many
have
more
or
less
difficulty
in
making
up
their
minds
it
is
further
complicated
because
the
painful
necessity
for
some
direct
action
has
arisen
in
connection
with
it
but
whatever
the
difficulty
i
am
convinced
that
there
is
no
question
so
important
as
this
one
if
we
want
harmony
and
peace
in
india
my
friend
objects
to
my
statement
that
is
not
because
he
considers
that
refusal
to
serve
it
and
pay
its
taxes
is
actually
i
respectfully
dissent
from
the
view
if
a
brother
has
fundamental
differences
with
his
brother
and
association
with
the
latter
involves
his
partaking
of
what
in
his
opinion
is
an
injustice
i
hold
that
it
is
brotherly
duty
to
refrain
from
serving
his
brother
and
sharing
his
earnings
with
him
this
happens
in
everyday
life
prahalad
did
not
act
against
his
father
when
he
declined
to
associate
himself
with
the
latter
blasphemies
nor
was
jesus
when
he
declaimed
against
the
pharisees
and
the
hypocrites
and
would
have
none
of
them
in
such
matters
is
it
not
intention
that
determines
the
character
of
a
particular
act
it
is
hardly
correct
as
the
friend
suggests
that
withdrawal
of
association
under
general
circumstances
would
make
all
government
impossible
but
it
is
true
that
such
withdrawal
would
make
all
injustice
impossible
my
correspondent
considers
that
the
government
of
india
having
done
all
it
possibly
could
could
not
be
applicable
to
that
government
in
my
opinion
whilst
it
is
true
that
the
government
of
india
has
done
a
great
deal
it
has
not
done
half
as
much
as
it
might
have
done
and
might
even
now
do
no
government
can
absolve
itself
from
further
action
beyond
protesting
when
it
realises
that
the
people
whom
it
represents
feel
as
keenly
as
do
lakhs
of
indian
mussalmans
in
the
khilafat
question
no
amount
of
sympathy
with
a
starving
man
can
possibly
avail
he
must
have
bread
or
he
dies
and
what
is
wanted
at
that
critical
moment
is
some
exertion
to
fetch
the
wherewithal
to
feed
the
dying
man
the
government
of
india
can
heed
the
agitation
and
ask
to
the
point
of
insistence
for
full
vindication
of
the
pledged
word
of
a
british
minister
has
the
government
of
india
resigned
by
way
of
protest
against
the
threatened
shameful
betrayal
of
trust
on
the
part
of
lloyd
george
why
does
the
government
of
india
hide
itself
behind
secret
despatches
at
a
less
critical
moment
lord
hardiage
committed
a
constitutional
indiscretion
openly
sympathised
with
south
african
passive
resistance
movement
and
stemmed
the
surging
tide
of
public
indignation
in
india
though
at
the
same
time
he
incurred
the
wrath
of
the
then
south
african
cabinet
and
some
public
men
in
great
britain
after
all
the
utmost
that
the
government
of
india
has
done
is
on
its
own
showing
to
transmit
and
press
the
mahomedan
claim
was
that
not
the
least
it
could
have
done
could
it
have
done
anything
less
without
covering
itself
with
disgrace
what
indian
mahomedans
and
the
indian
public
expect
the
government
of
india
to
do
at
this
critical
juncture
is
not
the
least
but
the
utmost
that
it
could
do
viceroys
have
been
known
to
tender
resignations
for
much
smaller
causes
wounded
pride
brought
forth
not
very
long
ago
the
resignation
of
a
lieutenant
governor
on
the
khilafat
question
a
sacred
cause
dear
to
the
hearts
of
several
million
mahomedans
is
in
danger
of
being
wounded
i
would
therefore
invite
the
english
friend
and
every
englishman
in
india
and
every
hindu
be
he
moderate
or
extremist
to
make
common
cause
with
the
mahomedans
and
thereby
compel
the
government
of
india
to
do
its
duty
and
thereby
compel
his
majesty
ministers
to
do
theirs
there
has
been
much
talk
of
violence
ensuing
from
active
i
venture
to
suggest
that
the
mussalmans
of
india
if
they
had
nothing
in
the
shape
of
in
view
would
have
long
ago
yielded
to
counsels
of
despair
i
admit
that
is
not
unattended
with
danger
but
violence
is
a
certainty
without
violence
is
only
a
possibility
with
and
it
will
he
a
greater
possibility
if
all
the
important
men
english
hindu
and
others
of
the
country
discountenance
it
i
think
that
the
recommendation
made
by
the
friend
is
being
literally
followed
by
the
mahomedans
although
they
practically
know
the
fate
they
are
waiting
for
the
actual
terms
of
the
treaty
with
turkey
they
are
certainly
going
to
try
every
means
at
their
disposal
to
have
the
terms
revised
before
beginning
and
there
will
certainly
be
no
commenced
so
long
as
there
is
even
hope
of
active
on
the
part
of
the
government
of
india
with
the
mahomedans
that
is
strong
enough
to
secure
a
revision
of
the
terms
should
they
be
found
to
be
in
conflict
with
the
pledges
of
british
statesmen
but
if
all
these
things
fail
can
mahomedans
as
men
of
honour
who
hold
their
religion
dearer
than
their
lives
do
anything
less
than
wash
their
hands
clean
of
the
guilt
of
british
ministers
and
the
government
of
india
by
refusing
to
with
them
and
can
hindus
and
englishmen
if
they
value
mahomedan
friendship
and
if
they
admit
then
full
justice
of
the
mahomaden
friendship
and
if
they
admit
the
full
justice
of
the
mahomedan
claim
do
otherwise
than
heartily
support
the
mahomedans
by
word
and
deed
pledges
broken
after
the
forgoing
was
printed
the
peace
terms
regarding
turkey
were
received
in
my
humble
opinion
they
are
humiliating
to
the
supreme
council
to
the
british
ministers
and
if
as
a
hindu
with
deep
reverence
for
christianity
i
may
say
so
a
denial
of
christ
teachings
turkey
broken
down
and
torn
with
dissentions
within
may
submit
to
the
arrogant
disposal
of
herself
and
indian
mahomedans
may
out
of
fear
do
likewise
hindus
out
of
fear
apathy
or
want
of
appreciation
of
the
situation
may
refuse
to
help
their
mahomedan
brethren
in
their
hour
of
peril
the
fact
remains
that
a
solemn
promise
of
the
prime
minister
of
england
has
been
wantonly
broken
i
will
say
nothing
about
president
wilson
fourteen
points
for
they
seem
now
to
be
entirely
forgotten
as
a
day
wonder
it
is
a
matter
of
deep
sorrow
that
the
government
of
india
offers
a
defence
of
the
terms
calls
them
a
fulfilment
of
lloyd
george
pledge
of
january
and
yet
apologises
for
their
defective
nature
and
appeals
to
the
mahomedans
of
india
as
if
to
mock
them
that
they
would
accept
the
terms
with
quiet
resignation
the
mask
that
veils
the
hypocrisy
is
too
thin
to
deceive
anybody
it
would
have
been
dignified
if
the
had
boldly
admitted
lloyd
george
mistake
in
having
made
the
promise
referred
to
as
it
is
the
claim
of
fulfilment
of
the
promise
only
adds
to
the
irritation
caused
by
its
glaring
breach
what
is
the
use
of
the
viceroy
saying
the
question
of
the
khilafat
is
one
for
the
mahomedans
and
mahomedans
only
and
that
with
their
free
choice
in
the
matter
government
have
no
desire
to
interfere
while
the
khalif
dominions
are
ruthlessly
dismembered
his
control
of
the
holy
places
of
islam
shamelessly
taken
away
from
him
and
he
himself
reduced
to
utter
impotence
in
his
own
palace
which
can
no
longer
be
called
a
palace
but
which
can
he
more
fitly
described
us
a
prison
no
wonder
his
excellency
fears
that
the
peace
includes
terms
which
must
be
painful
to
all
moslems
why
should
he
insult
muslim
intelligence
by
sending
the
mussalmans
of
india
a
of
encouragement
and
sympathy
are
they
expected
to
find
encouragement
in
the
cruel
recital
of
the
arrogant
terms
or
in
a
remembrance
of
splendid
response
made
by
them
to
the
call
of
the
king
the
day
of
the
empire
need
it
ill
becomes
his
excellency
to
talk
of
the
triumph
of
those
ideals
of
justice
and
humanity
for
which
the
allies
fought
indeed
the
terms
of
the
so
called
peace
with
turkey
if
they
are
to
last
will
be
a
monument
of
human
arrogance
and
injustice
to
attempt
to
crush
the
spirit
of
a
brave
and
gallant
race
because
it
has
lost
in
the
fortunes
of
war
is
a
triumph
not
of
humanity
but
a
demonstration
of
inhumanity
and
if
turkey
enjoyed
the
closest
ties
of
friendship
with
great
britain
before
the
war
great
britain
has
certainly
made
ample
reparation
for
her
mistake
by
having
made
the
largest
contribution
to
the
humiliation
of
turkey
it
is
insufferable
therefore
when
the
viceroy
feels
confident
that
with
the
conclusion
of
this
new
treaty
that
friendship
will
quickly
take
life
again
and
a
turkey
regenerate
full
of
hope
and
strength
will
stand
forth
in
the
future
as
in
the
past
a
pillar
of
the
islamic
faith
the
viceregal
message
audaciously
concludes
this
thought
will
i
trust
strengthen
you
to
accept
the
peace
terms
with
resignation
courage
and
fortitude
and
to
keep
your
loyalty
towards
the
crown
bright
and
untarnished
as
it
has
been
for
so
many
generations
if
muslim
loyalty
remains
untarnished
it
will
certainly
not
be
for
want
of
effort
on
the
part
of
the
government
of
india
to
put
the
heaviest
strain
upon
it
but
it
will
remain
so
because
the
mahomedans
realise
their
own
strength
the
strength
in
the
knowledge
that
their
cause
is
just
and
that
they
have
got
the
power
to
vindicate
justice
in
spite
of
the
aberration
suffered
by
great
britain
under
a
prime
minister
whom
continued
power
has
made
as
reckless
in
making
promises
as
in
breaking
them
whilst
therefore
i
admit
that
there
is
nothing
either
in
the
peace
terms
or
in
the
viceregal
message
covering
them
to
inspire
the
mahomedans
and
indians
in
general
with
confidence
or
hope
i
venture
to
suggest
that
there
is
no
cause
for
despair
and
anger
now
is
the
time
for
mahomedans
to
retain
absolute
to
unite
their
forces
and
weak
though
they
are
with
firm
faith
in
god
to
carry
on
the
struggle
with
redoubled
vigour
till
justice
is
done
if
india
both
hindu
and
mahomedan
can
act
as
one
man
and
can
withdraw
her
partnership
in
this
crime
against
humanity
which
the
peace
terms
represent
she
will
soon
secure
a
revision
of
the
treaty
and
give
herself
and
the
empire
at
least
if
not
the
world
a
lasting
peace
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
struggle
would
be
bitter
sharp
and
possibly
prolonged
but
it
is
worth
all
the
sacrifice
that
it
is
likely
to
call
forth
both
the
mussalmans
and
the
hindus
are
on
their
trial
is
the
humiliation
of
the
khilafat
a
matter
of
concern
to
the
former
and
if
it
is
are
they
prepared
to
exercise
restraint
religiously
refrain
from
violence
and
practise
without
counting
the
material
loss
it
may
entail
upon
the
community
do
the
hindus
honestly
feel
for
their
mahomedan
brethren
to
the
extent
of
sharing
their
sufferings
to
the
fullest
extent
the
answer
to
these
questions
and
not
the
peace
terms
will
finally
decide
the
fate
of
the
khilafat
more
objections
answered
is
one
of
the
most
influential
tamil
dailies
of
madras
it
is
widely
read
everything
appearing
in
its
columns
is
entitled
to
respect
the
editor
has
suggested
some
practical
difficulty
in
the
way
of
i
would
therefore
like
to
the
best
of
my
ability
to
deal
with
them
i
do
not
know
where
the
information
has
been
derived
from
that
i
have
given
up
the
last
two
stages
of
what
i
have
said
is
that
they
are
a
distant
goal
i
abide
by
it
i
admit
that
all
the
stages
are
fraught
with
some
danger
but
the
last
two
are
fraught
with
the
greatest
the
last
most
of
all
the
stages
have
been
fixed
with
a
view
to
running
the
least
possible
risk
the
last
two
stages
will
not
be
taken
up
unless
the
committee
has
attained
sufficient
control
over
the
people
to
warrant
the
beliefs
that
the
laying
down
of
arms
or
suspension
of
taxes
will
humanly
speaking
be
free
from
an
outbreak
of
violence
on
the
part
of
the
people
i
do
entertain
the
belief
that
it
is
possible
for
the
people
to
attain
the
discipline
necessary
for
taking
the
two
steps
when
once
they
realise
that
violence
is
totally
unnecessary
to
bend
an
unwilling
government
to
their
will
and
that
the
result
can
be
obtained
with
certainty
by
dignified
they
will
cease
to
think
of
violence
even
by
way
of
retaliation
the
fact
is
that
hitherto
we
have
not
attempted
to
take
concerted
and
disciplined
action
from
the
masses
some
day
if
we
are
to
become
truly
a
nation
that
attempt
has
to
be
made
the
present
in
my
opinion
is
a
propitious
movement
every
indian
feels
the
insult
to
the
punjab
as
a
personal
wrong
every
mussalman
resents
the
wrong
done
to
the
khilafat
there
is
therefore
a
favourable
atmosphere
for
expecting
cohesive
and
restrained
movement
on
the
part
of
the
masses
so
far
as
response
is
concerned
i
agree
with
the
editor
that
the
quickest
and
the
largest
response
is
to
be
expected
in
the
matter
of
suspension
of
payment
of
taxes
but
as
i
have
said
so
long
as
the
masses
are
not
educated
to
appreciate
the
value
of
even
whilst
their
holding
are
being
sold
so
long
must
it
be
difficult
to
take
up
the
last
stage
into
any
appreciable
extent
i
agree
too
that
a
sudden
withdrawal
of
the
military
and
the
police
will
be
a
disaster
if
we
have
not
acquired
the
ability
to
protect
ourselves
against
robbers
and
thieves
but
i
suggest
that
when
we
are
ready
to
call
out
the
military
and
the
police
on
an
extensive
scale
we
would
find
ourselves
in
a
position
to
defend
ourselves
if
the
police
and
the
military
resign
from
patriotic
motives
i
would
certainly
expect
them
to
perform
the
same
duty
as
national
volunteers
not
has
hirelings
but
as
willing
protectors
of
the
life
and
liberty
of
their
countrymen
the
movement
of
is
one
of
automatic
adjustment
if
the
government
schools
are
emptied
i
would
certainly
expect
national
schools
to
come
into
being
if
the
lawyers
as
a
whole
suspended
practice
they
would
devise
arbitration
courts
and
the
nation
will
have
expeditions
and
cheaper
method
of
setting
private
disputes
and
awarding
punishment
to
the
i
may
add
that
the
khilafat
committee
is
fully
alive
to
the
difficulty
of
the
task
and
is
taking
all
the
necessary
steps
to
meet
the
contingencies
as
they
arise
regarding
the
leaving
of
civil
employment
no
danger
is
feared
because
no
one
will
leave
his
employment
unless
he
is
in
a
position
to
find
support
for
himself
and
family
either
through
friends
or
otherwise
disapproval
of
the
proposed
withdrawal
of
students
betrays
in
my
humble
opinion
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
true
nature
of
it
is
true
enough
that
we
pay
the
money
wherewith
our
children
are
educated
but
when
the
agency
imparting
the
education
has
become
corrupt
we
may
not
employ
it
without
partaking
of
the
agents
corruption
when
students
leave
schools
or
colleges
i
hardly
imagine
that
the
teachers
will
fail
to
perceive
the
advisability
of
themselves
resigning
but
even
if
they
do
not
money
can
hardly
be
allowed
to
count
where
honour
or
religion
are
at
the
stake
as
to
the
boycott
of
the
councils
it
is
not
the
entry
of
the
moderates
or
any
other
persons
that
matters
so
much
as
the
entry
of
those
who
believe
in
you
may
not
at
the
top
and
at
the
bottom
a
councillor
can
not
remain
in
the
council
and
ask
the
who
cleans
the
to
resign
pennington
objections
answered
i
gladly
publish
pennington
letter
with
its
enclosure
just
as
i
have
received
them
evidently
pennington
is
not
a
regular
reader
of
india
or
he
would
have
noticed
that
no
one
has
condemned
mob
outrages
more
than
i
have
he
seems
to
think
that
the
article
he
has
objected
to
was
the
only
thing
i
have
ever
written
on
general
dyer
he
does
not
seem
to
know
that
i
have
endeavoured
with
the
utmost
impartiality
to
examine
the
jallianwala
massacre
and
he
can
see
any
day
all
the
proof
adduced
by
my
and
myself
in
support
of
our
findings
on
the
massacre
the
ordinary
readers
of
knew
all
the
facts
and
therefore
it
was
unnecessary
for
me
to
support
my
assertion
otherwise
but
unfortunately
pennington
represents
the
typical
englishman
he
does
not
want
to
be
unjust
nevertheless
he
is
rarely
just
in
his
appreciation
of
world
events
because
he
has
no
time
to
study
them
except
cursorily
and
that
through
a
press
whose
business
is
to
air
only
party
views
the
average
englishman
therefore
except
in
parochial
matters
is
perhaps
the
least
informed
though
he
claims
to
be
about
every
variety
of
interest
ignorance
is
thus
typical
of
the
others
and
affords
the
best
reason
for
securing
control
of
our
own
affairs
in
our
own
hands
ability
will
come
with
use
and
not
by
waiting
to
be
trained
by
those
whose
natural
interest
is
to
prolong
the
period
of
tutelage
as
much
as
possible
but
to
return
to
pennington
letter
he
complains
that
there
has
been
no
trial
of
any
one
the
fault
is
not
ours
india
has
consistently
and
insistently
demanded
a
trial
of
all
the
officers
concerned
in
the
crimes
against
the
punjab
he
next
objects
to
be
of
my
language
if
truth
is
violent
i
plead
guilty
to
the
charge
of
violence
of
language
but
i
could
not
without
doing
violence
to
truth
refrain
from
using
the
language
i
have
regarding
general
dyer
action
it
has
been
proved
out
of
his
own
mouth
or
hostile
witnesses
that
the
crowd
was
unarmed
that
it
contained
children
that
the
was
the
day
of
vaisakhi
fair
that
thousands
had
come
to
the
fair
that
there
was
no
rebellion
that
during
the
intervening
two
days
before
the
there
was
peace
in
amritsar
that
the
proclamation
of
the
meeting
was
made
the
same
day
as
general
dyer
proclamation
that
general
dyer
proclamation
prohibited
not
meetings
but
processions
or
gatherings
of
four
men
on
the
streets
and
not
in
private
or
public
places
that
general
dyer
ran
no
risk
whether
outside
or
inside
the
city
that
he
admitted
himself
that
many
in
the
crowd
did
not
know
anything
of
his
proclamation
that
he
fired
without
warning
the
crowd
and
even
after
it
had
begun
to
disperse
he
fired
on
the
backs
of
the
people
who
were
in
flight
that
the
men
were
practically
penned
in
an
enclosure
in
the
face
of
these
admitted
facts
i
do
call
the
deed
a
the
action
amounted
not
to
error
of
judgment
but
its
in
the
face
of
fancied
danger
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
say
that
pennington
notes
which
too
the
reader
will
find
published
elsewhere
betray
as
much
ignorance
as
his
letter
whatever
was
adopted
on
paper
in
the
days
of
canning
was
certainly
not
translated
into
action
in
its
full
sense
made
to
the
ear
were
broken
to
the
hope
was
said
by
a
reactionary
viceroy
military
expenditure
has
grown
enormously
since
the
days
of
canning
the
demonstration
in
favour
of
general
dyer
is
practically
a
myth
no
trace
was
found
of
the
danda
fauj
dignified
by
the
name
of
by
pennington
there
was
no
rebel
army
in
amritsar
the
crown
that
committed
the
horrible
murders
and
incendiarism
contained
no
one
community
exclusively
the
sheet
was
found
posted
only
in
lahore
and
not
in
amritsar
pennington
should
moreover
have
known
by
this
time
that
the
meeting
held
on
the
was
held
among
other
things
for
the
purpose
of
condemning
mob
excesses
this
was
brought
out
at
the
amritsar
trial
those
who
surrounded
him
could
not
stop
general
dyer
he
says
he
made
up
his
mind
to
shoot
in
a
moment
he
consulted
nobody
when
the
correspondent
says
that
the
troops
would
have
objected
to
being
concerned
in
might
in
that
case
be
not
unfairly
called
a
he
writes
as
if
he
had
never
lived
in
india
i
wish
the
indian
troops
had
the
moral
courage
to
refuse
to
shoot
innocent
unarmed
men
in
full
flight
but
the
indian
troops
have
been
brought
in
too
slavish
an
atmosphere
to
dare
do
any
such
correct
act
i
hope
pennington
will
not
accuse
me
again
of
making
unverified
assertions
because
i
have
not
quoted
from
the
books
the
evidence
is
there
for
him
to
use
i
can
only
assure
him
that
the
assertions
are
based
on
positive
proofs
mostly
obtained
from
official
sources
pennington
wants
me
to
publish
an
exact
account
of
what
happened
on
the
april
he
can
find
it
in
the
reports
and
if
he
will
patiently
go
through
them
he
will
discover
that
sir
michael
and
his
officials
goaded
the
people
into
frenzied
fury
a
fury
which
nobody
as
i
have
already
said
has
condemned
more
than
i
have
the
account
of
the
following
days
is
summed
up
in
one
word
on
the
part
of
the
crowd
disturbed
by
indiscriminate
arrests
the
massacre
and
the
series
of
official
crimes
that
followed
i
am
prepared
to
give
pennington
credit
for
seeking
after
the
truth
but
he
has
gone
about
it
in
the
wrong
manner
i
suggest
his
reading
the
evidence
before
the
hunter
committee
and
the
congress
committee
he
need
not
read
the
reports
but
the
evidence
will
convince
him
that
i
have
understated
the
case
against
general
dyer
when
however
i
read
his
description
of
himself
as
for
years
chief
magistrate
of
districts
in
the
south
of
india
before
reform
by
assassination
and
otherwise
became
so
fashionable
i
despair
of
his
being
able
to
find
the
truth
an
angry
or
a
biased
man
renders
himself
incapable
of
finding
it
and
pennington
is
evidently
both
angry
and
biased
what
does
he
mean
by
saying
before
reform
by
assassination
and
otherwise
became
so
fashionable
it
ill
becomes
him
to
talk
of
assassination
when
the
school
of
assassination
seems
happily
to
have
become
extinct
englishmen
will
never
see
the
truth
so
long
as
they
permit
their
vision
to
be
blinded
by
arrogant
assumption
of
superiority
or
ignorant
assumptions
of
infallibility
pennington
letter
to
gandhi
dear
sir
i
do
not
like
your
scheme
for
boycotting
the
government
of
india
under
what
seems
to
be
the
somewhat
less
offensive
though
more
cumbrous
name
of
but
have
always
given
you
credit
for
a
genuine
desire
to
carry
out
revolution
by
peaceful
means
and
am
astonished
at
the
violence
of
the
language
you
use
in
describing
general
dyer
on
page
of
your
issue
of
the
july
last
you
begin
by
saying
that
he
is
by
no
means
the
worst
offender
and
so
far
i
am
inclined
to
agree
though
as
there
has
been
no
proper
trial
of
anyone
it
is
impossible
to
apportion
their
guilt
but
then
you
say
his
brutality
is
unmistakable
his
abject
and
unsoldierlike
cowardice
is
apparent
he
has
called
an
of
men
and
children
mostly
holiday
makers
a
rebel
army
he
believes
himself
to
be
the
saviour
of
the
punjab
in
that
he
was
able
to
shoot
down
like
rabbits
men
who
were
in
an
enclosure
such
a
man
is
unworthy
to
be
considered
a
soldier
there
was
no
bravery
in
his
action
he
ran
no
risk
he
shot
without
the
slightest
opposition
and
without
warning
this
is
not
an
error
of
judgement
it
is
paralysis
of
it
in
the
face
of
danger
it
is
proof
of
criminal
incapacity
and
heartlessness
etc
you
must
excuse
me
for
saying
that
all
this
is
mere
rhetoric
unsupported
by
any
proof
even
where
proof
was
possible
to

with
neither
you
nor
i
were
present
at
the
jallianwalla
bagh
on
that
dreadful
day
dreadful
especially
for
general
dyer
for
whom
you
show
no
sympathy
and
therefore
can
not
know
for
certain
whether
the
crowd
was
or
was
not
unarmed
that
it
was
an
because
a
assembly
is
evident
for
it
is
absurd
to
suppose
that
general
dyer
hours
march
through
the
city
that
very
morning
during
the
whole
of
which
he
was
warning
the
inhabitants
against
the
danger
of
any
sort
of
gathering
was
not
thoroughly
you
say
they
were
holiday
makers
but
you
give
nor
proof
and
the
idea
of
holiday
gathering
in
amritsar
just
then
in
incredible
i
can
not
understand
your
making
such
a
suggestion
general
dyer
was
not
the
only
officer
present
on
the
occasion
and
it
is
impossible
to
suppose
that
he
would
have
been
allowed
to
go
on
shooting
into
an
innocent
body
of
even
the
troops
would
have
refused
to
carry
out
what
might
then
have
been
not
unfairly
called
a
massacre
i
notice
that
you
never
even
allude
to
the
frightful
brutality
of
the
mob
which
was
immediately
responsible
for
the
punitive
measure
reluctantly
adopted
by
general
dyer
your
sympathies
seem
to
be
only
with
the
murderers
and
i
am
not
sanguine
enough
to
suppose
that
my
view
of
the
case
will
have
much
influence
with
you
still
i
am
bound
to
do
what
i
can
to
get
at
the
truth
and
enclose
a
copy
of
some
notes
i
have
had
occasion
to
make
if
you
can
publish
an
account
of
what
happened
at
amritsar
on
the
of
april
and
the
following
days

be

the
case
in
this

general

acting
as

of
government
on
the
spot
shot
some
hundreds
of
people
some
of
them
innocently
mixed
up
in
an
illegal
assembly
in
the
belief
that
he
was
dealing
with
the
remains
of
a
very
dangerous
rebellion
and
was
thereby
saving
the
lives
of
very
many
thousands
and
in
the
opinion
of
a
great
many
people
did
actually
save
the
city
from
falling
in
the
hands
of
a
dangerous
mob
some
doubts
babu
janakdhari
prasad
was
a
staunch
coworker
with
me
in
champaran
he
has
written
a
long
letter
setting
forth
his
reasons
for
his
belief
that
india
has
a
great
mission
before
her
and
that
she
can
achieve
her
purpose
only
by
but
he
has
doubts
which
he
would
have
me
answer
publicly
the
letter
being
long
i
am
withholding
but
the
doubts
are
entitled
to
respect
and
i
must
endeavour
to
answer
them
here
they
are
us
framed
by
bubu
janakdhari
prasad
a
is
not
the
movement
creating
a
sort
of
between
englishmen
and
indians
and
is
it
in
accordance
with
the
divine
plan
of
universal
love
and
brotherhood
b
does
not
the
use
of
words
devilish
satanic
savour
of
unbrotherly
sentiment
and
incite
feelings
of
hatred
c
should
not
the
movement
be
conducted
on
strictly
and
lines
both
in
speech
and
action
d
is
there
no
danger
of
the
movement
going
out
of
control
and
lending
to
violence
as
to
a
i
must
say
that
the
movement
is
not
it
certainly
gives
as
i
have
already
said
disciplined
expression
to
it
you
can
not
eradicate
evil
by
ignoring
it
it
is
because
i
want
to
promote
universal
brotherhood
that
i
have
taken
up
so
that
by
india
may
make
the
world
better
than
it
is
as
to
b
i
know
that
the
words
and
are
strong
but
they
relate
the
exact
truth
they
describe
a
system
not
persons
we
are
bound
to
hate
evil
if
we
would
shun
it
but
by
means
of
we
are
able
to
distinguish
between
the
evil
and
the
i
have
found
no
difficulty
in
describing
a
particular
activity
of
a
brother
of
mine
to
be
devilish
but
i
am
not
aware
of
having
harboured
any
hatred
about
him
teaches
us
to
love
our
fellowmen
in
spite
of
their
faults
not
by
ignoring
or
them
as
to
c
the
movement
is
certainly
being
conducted
on
strictly
lines
that
all
have
not
yet
thoroughly
imbibed
the
doctrine
is
true
but
that
just
shows
what
an
evil
legacy
we
have
inherited
emotion
there
is
in
the
movement
and
it
will
remain
a
man
without
emotion
is
a
man
without
feeling
as
to
d
there
certainly
is
danger
of
the
movement
becoming
violent
but
we
may
no
more
drop
because
of
its
dangers
than
we
may
stop
freedom
because
of
the
danger
of
its
abuse
rejoinder
popley
and
philips
have
been
good
enough
to
reply
to
my
letter
to
every
englishman
in
india
i
recognise
and
appreciate
the
friendly
spirit
of
their
letter
but
i
see
that
there
are
fundamental
differences
which
must
for
the
time
being
divide
them
and
me
so
long
as
i
felt
that
in
spite
of
grievous
lapses
the
british
empire
represented
an
activity
for
the
worlds
and
india
good
i
clung
to
it
like
a
child
to
its
mother
breast
but
that
faith
is
gone
the
british
nation
has
endorsed
the
punjab
and
khilsfat
crimes
the
is
no
doubt
a
dissenting
minority
but
a
dissenting
minority
that
satisfies
itself
with
a
mere
expression
of
its
opinion
and
continues
to
help
the
partakes
in
and
when
the
sum
total
of
his
energy
represents
a
minus
quantity
one
may
not
pick
out
the
plus
quantities
hold
them
up
for
admiration
and
ask
an
admiring
public
to
help
regarding
them
it
is
a
favourite
design
of
satan
to
temper
evil
with
a
show
of
good
and
thus
lure
the
unwary
into
the
trap
the
only
way
the
world
has
known
of
defeating
satan
is
by
shunning
him
i
invite
englishmen
who
could
work
out
the
ideal
the
believe
in
to
join
the
ranks
of
the
stead
prayed
for
the
reverse
of
the
british
arms
during
the
boer
war
miss
hobbhouse
invited
the
boers
to
keep
up
the
fight
the
betrayal
of
india
is
much
worse
than
the
injustice
done
to
the
boers
the
boers
fought
and
bled
for
their
rights
when
therefore
we
are
prepared
to
bleed
the
right
will
have
become
embodied
and
idolatrous
world
will
perceive
it
and
do
homage
to
it
but
messers
popley
and
phillips
object
that
i
have
allied
myself
with
those
who
would
draw
the
sword
if
they
could
i
see
nothing
wrong
in
it
they
represent
the
right
no
less
than
i
do
and
is
it
not
worth
while
trying
to
prevent
an
unsheathing
of
the
sword
by
helping
to
win
the
bloodless
battle
those
who
recognise
the
truth
of
the
indian
position
can
only
do
god
work
by
assisting
this
campaign
the
second
objection
raised
by
these
english
friends
is
more
to
the
point
i
would
be
guilty
of
myself
if
the
muslim
cause
was
not
just
the
fact
is
that
the
muslim
claim
is
not
to
perpetuate
foreign
domination
of
or
turkish
races
the
indian
mussalmans
do
not
resist
but
they
would
fight
to
the
last
the
nefarious
plan
of
exploiting
mesopotamia
under
the
plea
of
they
must
resist
the
studied
attempt
to
humiliate
turkey
and
therefore
islam
under
the
false
pretext
of
ensuring
armenian
independence
the
third
objection
has
reference
to
schools
i
do
object
to
missionary
or
any
schools
being
carried
on
with
government
money
it
is
true
that
it
was
at
one
time
our
money
will
these
good
missionaries
be
justified
in
educating
me
with
funds
given
to
them
by
a
robber
who
has
robbed
me
of
my
money
religion
and
honour
because
the
money
was
originally
mine
i
personally
tolerated
the
financial
robbery
of
india
but
it
would
have
been
a
sin
to
have
tolerated
the
robbery
of
honour
through
the
punjab
and
of
religion
through
turkey
this
is
strong
language
but
nothing
less
would
truly
describe
my
deep
conviction
needless
to
add
that
the
emptying
of
government
aided
or
affiliated
schools
does
not
mean
starving
the
young
mind
national
schools
are
coming
into
being
as
fast
as
the
others
are
emptied
popley
and
phillips
think
that
my
sense
of
justice
has
been
blurred
by
the
knowledge
of
the
punjab
and
the
khilafat
wrongs
i
hope
not
i
have
asked
friends
to
show
me
some
good
fruit
intended
and
deliberately
produced
of
the
british
occupation
of
india
and
i
assure
them
that
i
shall
make
the
amplest
amends
if
i
find
that
i
have
erred
in
my
eagerness
about
the
khilafat
and
the
punjab
wrongs
two
englishmen
reply
dear
gandhi
thank
you
for
your
letter
to
every
englishman
in
india
with
its
and
its
generous
tone
something
within
us
responds
to
the
note
which
you
have
struck
we
are
not
representatives
of
any
corporate
body
but
we
think
that
millions
of
our
countrymen
in
england
and
not
a
few
in
india
feel
as
we
do
the
reading
of
your
letter
convinces
us
that
you
and
we
can
not
be
real
enemies
may
we
say
at
once
that
in
so
far
as
the
british
empire
stands
for
the
domination
and
exploitation
of
other
races
for
britain
benefit
for
degrading
treatment
of
any
for
traffic
in
intoxicating
liquors
for
repressive
legislation
for
administration
such
as
that
which
to
the
amritsar
incidents
we
desire
the
end
of
it
as
much
as
you
do
we
quite
understand
that
in
the
excitement
of
the
present
crisis
owing
to
certain
acts
of
the
british
administration
which
we
join
with
you
in
condemning
the
empire
presents
itself
to
you
under
this
aspect
along
but
from
personal
contact
with
our
countrymen
we
know
that
working
like
leaven
in
the
midst
of
such
tendencies
as
you
and
we
deplore
is
the
faith
in
a
better
ideal
the
ideal
of
a
commonwealth
of
free
peoples
voluntarily
linked
together
by
the
ties
of
common
experience
in
the
past
and
common
aspirations
for
the
future
a
commonwealth
which
may
hope
to
spread
liberty
and
progress
through
the
whole
earth
with
vast
numbers
of
our
countrymen
we
value
the
british
empire
mainly
as
affording
the
possibility
of
the
realization
of
such
an
idea
and
on
the
ground
give
it
our
loyal
allegiance
meanwhile
we
do
repent
of
that
arrogant
attitude
to
indians
which
has
been
all
too
common
among
our
countrymen
we
do
hold
indians
to
be
our
brothers
and
equals
many
of
them
our
superiors
and
we
would
rather
be
servants
than
rulers
of
india
we
desire
an
administration
which
can
not
he
intimated
either
by
the
selfish
element
in
political
opinion
or
by
any
other
sectional
interest
and
which
shall
govern
in
accordance
with
the
best
democratic
principles
we
should
welcome
the
convening
of
a
national
assembly
of
recognized
leaders
of
the
people
representing
all
shades
of
political
opinion
of
every
caste
race
and
creed
to
frame
a
constitution
for
swaraj
in
all
the
things
that
matter
most
we
are
with
you
surely
you
and
we
can
in
the
service
of
india
in
such
matters
for
example
as
education
it
seems
to
us
nothing
short
of
a
tragedy
that
you
should
be
rallying
indian
patriotism
to
inaugurate
a
new
era
of
good
will
under
a
watchword
that
divides
instead
of
uniting
all
we
have
spoken
of
the
large
amount
of
common
ground
upon
which
you
and
we
can
stand
but
frankness
demands
that
we
express
our
anxiety
about
some
items
in
your
programme
leaving
aside
smaller
questions
on
which
your
letter
seems
to
us
to
do
the
british
side
less
than
justice
may
we
mention
three
main
points
your
insistence
on
spiritual
forces
alone
we
deeply
respect
and
desire
to
emulate
but
we
can
not
understand
your
combining
into
it
with
a
close
alliance
with
those
who
as
you
frankly
say
would
draw
the
sword
as
soon
as
they
could
your
desire
for
an
education
truly
national
commands
our
approval
but
instead
of
indianizing
the
present
system
as
you
could
begin
to
do
from
the
beginning
of
next
year
or
instead
of
creating
a
hundred
institutions
such
as
that
at
bolpur
and
turning
into
them
the
stream
of
india
young
intellectual
life
you
appear
to
be
turning
that
stream
out
of
its
present
channel
into
open
sands
where
it
may
dry
up
in
other
words
you
seem
to
us
to
be
risking
the
complete
cessation
for
a
period
possibly
of
years
of
all
education
for
a
large
number
of
boys
and
young
men
is
it
best
for
those
young
men
or
for
india
that
the
present
imperfect
education
should
cease
before
a
better
education
is
ready
to
take
its
place
your
desire
to
unite
mohammedan
and
hindu
and
to
share
with
your
mohammedan
brethren
in
seeking
the
satisfaction
of
mohammedan
aspirations
we
can
understand
and
sympathize
with
but
is
there
no
danger
in
the
course
which
some
of
your
party
have
urged
upon
the
government
that
certain
races
in
the
former
ottoman
empire
might
be
fixed
under
a
foreign
yoke
for
worse
than
that
which
you
hold
the
english
yoke
to
be
you
could
not
wish
to
purchase
freedom
in
india
at
the
price
of
enslavement
in
the
middle
east
to
sum
up
we
thank
you
for
the
spirit
of
your
letter
to
which
we
have
tried
to
respond
in
the
same
spirit
we
are
with
you
in
the
desire
for
an
india
genuinely
free
to
develop
the
best
that
is
in
her
and
in
the
belief
that
best
is
something
wonderful
of
which
the
world
stands
in
need
we
are
ready
to
with
you
and
with
every
other
man
of
any
race
or
nationality
who
will
help
india
to
realize
her
best
are
you
going
to
insist
that
you
can
have
nothing
to
do
with
us
if
we
receive
a
government
grant
indian
money
for
an
indian
school
surely
some
more
inspiring
battle
cry
than
can
be
discovered
we
have
ventured
quite
frankly
to
point
out
three
items
in
your
present
programme
which
seem
to
us
likely
to
hinder
the
attainment
of
your
true
ideals
for
indian
greatness
but
those
ideals
themselves
command
our
warm
sympathy
and
we
desire
to
work
so
far
as
we
have
opportunity
for
their
attainment
in
fact
it
is
only
thus
that
we
can
interpret
our
british
citizenship

renunciation
of

gandhi
has
addressed
the
following
letter
to
the
viceroy
it
is
not
without
a
pang
that
i
return
the
gold
medal
granted
to
me
by
your
predecessor
for
my
humanitarian
work
in
south
africa
the
zulu

medal
granted
in

for
my
services
as
officer
in

of
the
indian
volunteer
ambulance
corps
in
and
the
boer

medal
fur
my
services
as
assistant
superintendent
of
the
indian
volunteer
stretcher
bearer
corps
during
the
boer

of
i
venture
to
return
these
medals
in
pursuance
of
the
scheme
of
inaugurated
in
connection
with
the
khilafat
movement
valuable
as
those
honours
have
been
to
me
i
can
not
wear
them
with
an
easy
conscience
so
long
as
my
mussalman
countrymen
have
to
labour
under
a
wrong
done
to
their
religious
sentiment
events
that
have
happened
during
the
past
month
have
confirmed
me
in
the
opinion
that
the
imperial
government
have
acted
in
the
khilafat
matter
in
an
unscrupulous
immoral
and
unjust
manner
and
have
been
moving
from
wrong
to
wrong
in
order
to
defend
their
immorality
i
can
retain
neither
respect
nor
affection
for
such
a
government
the
attitude
of
the
imperial
and
your
excellency
governments
on
the
punjab
question
has
given
me
additional
cause
for
grave
dissatisfaction
i
had
the
honour
as
your
excellency
is
aware
as
one
of
the
congress
commissioners
to
investigate
the
causes
of
the
disorders
in
the
punjab
during
the
april
of
and
it
is
my
deliberate
conviction
that
sir
michael
was
totally
unfit
to
hold
the
office
of
lieutenant
governor
of
punjab
and
that
his
policy
was
primarily
responsible
for
infuriating
the
mob
at
amritsar
no
doubt
the
mob
excesses
were
unpardonable
incendiarism
murder
of
five
innocent
englishmen
and
the
cowardly
assault
on
miss
sherwood
were
most
deplorable
and
uncalled
for
but
the
punitive
measures
taken
by
general
dyer
frank
johnson
bosworth
smith
rai
shri
ram
sud
malik
khan
and
other
officers
were
out
of
all
proportional
to
the
crime
of
the
people
and
amounted
to
wanton
cruelty
and
inhumanity
and
almost
unparalleled
in
modern
times
your
excellency
treatment
of
the
official
crime
your
exoneration
of
sir
michael
montagu
dispatch
and
above
all
the
shameful
ignorance
of
the
punjab
events
and
callous
disregard
of
the
feelings
of
indians
betrayed
by
the
house
of
lords
have
filled
me
with
the
gravest
misgivings
regarding
the
future
of
the
empire
have
estranged
me
completely
from
the
present
government
and
have
disabled
me
from
tendering
as
i
have
hitherto
tendered
my
loyal
in
my
humble
opinion
the
ordinary
method
of
agitating
by
way
of
petitions
deputations
and
the
like
is
no
remedy
for
moving
to
repentence
a
government
so
hopelessly
indifferent
to
the
welfare
of
its
charges
as
the
government
of
india
has
proved
to
me
in
european
countries
condonation
of
such
grievous
wrongs
as
the
khilafat
and
the
punjab
would
have
resulted
in
a
bloody
revolution
by
the
people
they
would
have
resisted
at
all
costs
national
emasculation
such
as
the
said
wrongs
imply
but
half
of
india
is
to
weak
to
offer
violent
resistance
and
the
other
half
is
unwilling
to
do
so
i
have
therefore
ventured
to
suggest
the
remedy
of
which
enables
those
who
wish
to
dissociate
themselves
from
the
government
and
which
if
it
is
unattended
by
violence
and
undertaken
in
an
ordered
manner
must
compel
it
to
retrace
its
steps
and
undo
the
wrongs
committed
but
whilst
i
shall
pursue
the
policy
of
in
so
far
as
i
can
carry
the
people
with
me
i
shall
not
lose
hope
that
you
will
yet
see
your
way
to
do
justice
i
therefore
respectfully
ask
your
excellency
to
summon
a
conference
of
the
recognised
leaders
of
the
people
and
in
consultation
with
them
find
a
way
that
would
placate
the
mussalmans
and
do
reparation
to
the
unhappy
punjab
mahatma
gandhi
letter
to
the
duke
of
connaught
the
following
letter
has
been
addressed
by
gandhi
to
his
royal
highness
the
duke
of
connaught
sir
your
royal
highness
must
have
heard
a
great
deal
about
and
their
methods
and
incidentally
of
me
its
humble
author
i
fear
that
the
information
given
to
your
royal
highness
must
have
been
in
its
nature
i
owe
it
to
you
and
to
my
friends
and
myself
that
i
should
place
before
you
what
i
conceive
to
be
the
scope
of
as
followed
not
only
be
me
but
my
closest
associates
such
as
shaukat
ali
and
mahomed
ali
for
me
it
is
no
joy
and
pleasure
to
be
actively
associated
in
the
boycott
of
your
royal
highness
visit
i
have
tendered
loyal
and
voluntary
association
to
the
government
for
an
unbroken
period
of
nearly
years
in
the
full
belief
that
through
that
way
lay
the
path
of
freedom
for
my
country
it
was
therefore
no
slight
thing
for
me
to
suggest
to
my
countrymen
that
we
should
take
no
part
in
welcoming
your
royal
highness
not
one
among
us
has
anything
against
you
as
an
english
gentleman
we
hold
your
person
as
sacred
as
that
of
a
dearest
friend
i
do
not
know
any
of
my
friends
who
would
not
guard
it
with
his
life
if
he
found
it
in
danger
we
are
not
at
war
with
individual
englishmen
we
seek
not
to
destroy
english
life
we
do
desire
to
destroy
a
system
that
has
emasculated
our
country
in
body
mind
and
soul
we
are
determined
to
battle
with
all
our
might
against
that
in
the
english
nature
which
has
made
and
dyerism
possible
in
the
punjab
and
has
resulted
in
a
wanton
affront
upon
islam
a
faith
professed
by
seven
crores
of
our
countrymen
the
affront
has
been
put
in
breach
of
the
letter
and
the
spirit
of
the
solemn
declaration
of
the
prime
minister
we
consider
it
to
be
inconsistent
with
our
self
respect
any
longer
to
brook
the
spirit
of
superiority
and
dominance
which
has
systematically
ignored
and
disregarded
the
sentiments
of
thirty
crores
of
the
innocent
people
of
india
on
many
a
vital
matter
it
is
humiliating
to
us
it
can
not
be
a
matter
of
pride
to
you
that
thirty
crores
of
indians
should
live
day
in
and
day
out
in
the
fear
of
their
lives
from
one
hundred
thousand
englishmen
and
therefore
be
under
subjection
to
them
your
royal
highness
has
come
not
to
end
the
system
i
have
described
but
to
sustain
it
by
upholding
its
prestige
your
first
pronouncement
was
a
laudation
of
lord
wellingdon
i
have
the
privilege
of
knowing
him
i
believe
him
to
be
an
honest
and
amiable
gentleman
who
will
not
willingly
hurt
even
a
fly
but
he
has
certainly
failed
as
a
ruler
he
allowed
himself
to
be
guided
by
those
whose
interest
it
was
to
support
their
power
he
is
reading
the
mind
of
the
dravidian
province
here
in
bengal
you
are
issuing
a
certificate
of
merit
to
a
governor
who
is
again
from
all
i
have
heard
an
estimable
gentleman
but
he
knows
nothing
of
the
heart
of
bengal
and
its
yearnings
bengal
is
not
calcutta
fort
william
and
the
palaces
of
calcutta
represent
an
insolent
exploitation
of
the
unmurmuring
and
highly
cultured
peasantry
of
this
fair
province
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
must
not
be
deceived
by
the
reforms
that
tinker
with
the
problem
of
india
distress
and
humiliation
nor
must
they
be
impatient
and
angry
we
must
not
in
our
impatient
anger
resort
to
stupid
violence
we
freely
admit
that
we
must
take
our
due
share
of
the
blame
for
the
existing
state
it
is
not
so
much
the
british
guns
that
are
responsible
fur
our
subjection
as
our
voluntary
our
in
a
hearty
welcome
to
your
royal
highness
is
thus
in
no
sense
a
demonstration
against
your
high
personage
but
it
is
against
the
system
you
have
come
to
uphold
i
know
that
individual
englishmen
can
not
even
if
they
will
alter
the
english
nature
all
of
a
sudden
if
we
would
be
equals
of
englishmen
we
must
cast
off
fear
we
must
learn
to
be
and
independent
of
the
schools
courts
protection
and
patronage
of
a
government
we
seek
to
end
if
it
will
not
mend
hence
this
i
know
that
we
have
not
all
yet
become
in
speech
and
deed
but
the
results
so
far
achieved
have
i
assure
your
royal
highness
been
amazing
the
people
have
understood
the
secret
and
the
value
of
as
they
have
never
done
before
he
who
runs
may
see
that
this
a
religious
purifying
movement
we
are
leaving
off
drink
we
are
trying
to
rid
india
of
the
curse
of
untouchability
we
are
trying
to
throw
off
foreign
tinsel
splendour
and
by
reverting
to
the
spinning
wheel
reviving
the
ancient
and
the
poetic
simplicity
of
life
we
hope
thereby
to
sterilize
the
existing
harmful
institution
i
ask
your
royal
highness
as
an
englishman
to
study
this
movement
and
its
possibilities
for
the
empire
and
the
world
we
are
at
war
with
nothing
that
is
good
in
the
world
in
protecting
islam
in
the
manner
we
are
we
are
protecting
all
religions
in
protecting
the
honour
of
india
we
are
protecting
the
honour
of
humanity
for
our
means
are
hurtful
to
none
we
desire
to
live
on
terms
of
friendship
with
englishmen
but
that
friendship
must
be
friendship
of
equals
in
both
theory
and
practice
and
we
must
continue
to
to
purify
ourselves
till
the
goal
is
achieved
i
ask
your
royal
highness
and
through
you
every
englishman
to
appreciate
the
of
the
i
beg
to
remain
your
royal
highness
faithful
servant
sd
gandhi
the
greatest
thing
it
is
to
be
wished
that
will
clearly
recognise
that
nothing
can
stop
the
onward
march
of
the
nation
as
violence
ireland
may
gain
its
freedom
by
violence
turkey
may
regain
her
lost
possessions
by
violence
within
measurable
distance
of
time
but
india
can
not
win
her
freedom
by
violence
for
a
century
because
her
people
are
not
built
in
the
manner
of
other
nations
they
have
been
nurtured
in
the
traditions
of
suffering
rightly
or
wrongly
for
good
or
ill
islam
too
has
evolved
along
peaceful
lines
in
india
and
i
make
bold
to
say
that
if
the
honour
of
islam
is
to
be
vindicated
through
its
followers
in
india
it
will
only
be
by
methods
of
peaceful
silent
dignified
conscious
and
courageous
suffering
the
more
i
study
that
wonderful
faith
the
more
convinced
i
become
that
the
glory
of
islam
is
due
not
to
the
sword
but
to
the
sufferings
the
renunciation
and
the
nobility
of
its
early
caliphs
islam
decayed
when
its
followers
mistaking
the
evil
for
the
good
dangled
the
sword
in
the
face
of
man
and
lost
sight
of
the
godliness
the
humility
and
austerity
of
its
founder
and
his
disciples
but
i
am
not
at
the
present
moment
concerned
with
showing
that
the
basis
of
islam
as
of
all
religions
is
not
violence
but
suffering
not
the
taking
of
life
but
the
giving
of
it
what
i
am
anxious
to
show
is
that
must
be
true
as
well
to
the
spirit
as
to
the
letter
of
their
vow
if
they
would
gain
swaraj
within
one
year
they
may
forget
but
they
dare
not
forget
indeed
is
we
are
violent
when
we
sustain
a
government
whose
creed
is
violence
it
bases
itself
finally
not
on
right
but
on
might
its
last
appeal
is
not
to
reason
nor
the
heart
but
to
the
sword
we
are
tired
of
this
creed
and
we
have
risen
against
it
let
us
not
ourselves
belie
our
profession
by
being
violent
though
the
english
are
very
few
they
are
organised
for
violence
though
we
are
many
we
can
not
be
organised
for
violence
for
a
long
time
to
come
violence
for
us
is
a
gospel
or
despair
i
have
seen
a
pathetic
letter
from
a
english
woman
who
defends
dyerism
for
she
thinks
that
if
general
dyer
had
not
enacted
jallianwala
women
and
children
would
have
been
murdered
by
us
if
we
are
such
brutes
as
to
desire
the
blood
of
innocent
women
and
children
we
deserve
to
be
blotted
out
from
the
face
of
the
earth
there
is
the
other
side
it
did
not
strike
this
good
lady
that
if
we
were
friends
the
price
that
her
countrymen
paid
at
jallianwala
for
buying
their
safety
was
too
great
they
gained
their
safety
at
the
cost
of
their
humanity
general
dyer
has
been
haltingly
blamed
and
his
evil
genius
sir
michael
entirely
exonerated
because
englishmen
do
not
want
to
leave
this
country
of
fields
even
if
everyone
of
us
has
to
be
killed
if
we
go
mad
again
as
we
did
at
amritsar
let
there
be
no
mistake
that
a
blacker
jallianwala
will
be
enacted
shall
we
copy
dyerism
and
even
whilst
we
are
condemning
it
let
not
our
rock
be
violence
and
devilry
our
rock
must
be
and
godliness
let
us
workers
be
clear
as
to
what
we
are
about
depends
upon
our
ability
to
control
all
the
forces
of
violence
on
our
therefore
there
is
no
swaraj
within
one
year
if
there
is
violence
on
the
part
of
the
people
we
must
then
refrain
from
sitting
we
must
refrain
from
crying
shame
to
anybody
we
must
not
use
any
coercion
to
persuade
our
people
to
adopt
our
way
we
must
guarantee
to
them
the
same
freedom
we
claim
for
ourselves
we
must
not
tamper
with
the
masses
it
is
dangerous
to
make
political
use
of
factory
labourers
or
the
peasantry
not
that
we
are
not
entitled
to
do
so
but
we
are
not
ready
for
it
we
have
neglected
their
political
as
distinguished
from
literary
education
all
these
long
years
we
have
not
got
enough
honest
intelligent
reliable
and
brave
workers
to
enable
us
to
act
upon
these
countrymen
of
ours
ix
mahatma
gandhi
statement
the
following
is
the
statement
of
mahatma
gandhi
made
before
the
court
during
his
trial
in
ahmedabad
on
the
march
before
reading
his
written
statement
mahatma
gandhi
spoke
a
few
words
as
introductory
remarks
to
the
whole
statement
he
said
before
i
read
this
statement
i
would
like
to
state
that
i
entirely
endorse
the
learned
remarks
in
connection
with
my
humble
self
i
think
that
he
was
entirely
fair
to
me
in
all
the
statements
that
he
has
made
because
it
is
very
true
and
i
have
no
desire
whatsoever
to
conceal
from
this
court
the
fact
that
to
preach
disaffection
towards
the
existing
system
of
government
has
become
almost
a
passion
with
me
and
the
learned
is
also
entirely
in
the
right
when
he
says
that
my
preaching
of
disaffection
did
not
commence
with
my
connection
with
young
india
but
that
it
commenced
much
earlier
and
in
the
statement
that
i
am
about
to
read
it
will
be
my
painful
duty
to
admit
before
this
court
that
it
commenced
much
earlier
than
the
period
stated
by
the
it
is
the
most
painful
duty
with
me
but
i
have
to
discharge
that
duty
knowing
the
responsibility
that
rested
upon
my
shoulders
and
i
wish
to
endorse
all
the
blame
that
the
has
thrown
on
my
shoulders
in
connection
with
the
bombay
occurrence
madras
occurrences
and
the
chouri
choura
occurrences
thinking
over
these
things
deeply
and
sleeping
over
them
night
after
night
and
examining
my
heart
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
dissociate
myself
from
the
diabolical
crimes
of
chouri
choura
or
the
mad
outrages
of
bombay
he
is
quite
right
when
he
says
that
as
a
man
of
responsibility
a
man
having
received
a
fair
share
of
education
having
had
a
fair
share
of
experience
of
this
world
i
should
know
them
i
knew
that
i
was
playing
with
fire
i
ran
the
risk
and
if
i
was
set
free
i
would
still
do
the
same
i
would
be
failing
in
my
duty
if
i
do
not
do
so
i
have
felt
it
this
morning
that
i
would
have
failed
in
my
duty
if
i
did
not
say
all
what
i
said
here
just
now
i
wanted
to
avoid
violence
is
the
first
article
of
my
faith
it
is
the
last
article
of
my
faith
but
i
had
to
make
my
choice
i
had
either
to
submit
to
a
system
which
i
considered
has
done
an
irreparable
harm
to
my
country
or
incur
the
risk
of
the
mad
fury
of
my
people
bursting
forth
when
they
understood
the
truth
from
my
lips
i
know
that
my
people
have
sometimes
gone
mad
i
am
deeply
sorry
for
it
and
i
am
therefore
here
to
submit
not
to
a
light
penalty
but
to
the
highest
penalty
i
do
not
ask
for
mercy
i
do
not
plead
any
extenuating
act
i
am
here
therefore
to
invite
and
submit
to
the
highest
penalty
that
can
be
inflicted
upon
me
for
what
in
law
is
a
deliberate
crime
and
what
appears
to
me
to
be
the
highest
duty
of
a
citizen
the
only
course
open
to
you
judge
is
as
i
am
just
going
to
say
in
my
statement
either
to
resign
your
post
or
inflict
on
me
the
severest
penalty
if
you
believe
that
the
system
and
law
you
are
assisting
to
administer
are
good
for
the
people
i
do
not
expect
that
kind
of
conversion
but
by
the
time
i
have
finished
with
my
statement
you
will
perhaps
have
a
glimpse
of
what
is
raging
within
my
breast
to
run
this
maddest
risk
which
a
sane
man
can
run
written
statement
i
owe
it
perhaps
to
the
indian
public
and
to
the
public
in
england
to
placate
which
this
prosecution
is
mainly
taken
up
that
i
should
explain
why
from
a
staunch
loyalist
and
i
have
become
an
uncompromising
disaffectionist
and
to
the
court
too
i
should
say
why
i
plead
guilty
to
the
charge
of
promoting
disaffection
towards
the
government
established
by
law
in
india
my
public
life
began
in
in
south
africa
in
troubled
weather
my
first
contact
with
british
authority
in
that
country
was
not
of
a
happy
character
i
discovered
that
as
a
man
and
as
an
indian
i
had
no
rights
on
the
contrary
i
discovered
that
i
had
no
rights
as
a
man
because
i
was
an
indian
but
i
was
not
baffled
i
thought
that
this
treatment
of
indians
was
an
excrescence
upon
a
system
that
was
intrinsically
and
mainly
good
i
gave
the
government
my
voluntary
and
hearty
criticising
it
fully
where
i
felt
it
was
faulty
but
never
wishing
its
destruction
consequently
when
the
existence
of
the
empire
was
threatened
in
by
the
boer
challenge
i
offered
my
services
to
it
raised
a
volunteer
ambulance
corps
and
served
at
several
actions
that
took
place
for
the
relief
of
ladysmith
similarly
in
at
the
time
of
the
zulu
revolt
i
raised
a
party
and
served
till
the
end
of
the
on
both
these
occasions
i
received
medals
and
was
even
mentioned
in
despatches
for
my
work
in
south
africa
i
was
given
by
lord
hardinge
a
gold
medal
when
the
war
broke
out
in
between
england
and
germany
i
raised
a
volunteer
ambulance
corps
in
london
consisting
of
the
then
resident
indians
in
london
chiefly
students
its
work
was
acknowledged
by
the
authorities
to
be
valuable
lastly
in
india
when
a
special
appeal
was
made
at
the
war
conference
in
delhi
in
by
lord
chelmsford
for
recruits
i
struggled
at
the
cost
of
my
health
to
raise
a
corps
in
kheda
and
the
response
was
being
made
when
the
hostilities
ceased
and
orders
were
received
that
no
more
recruits
were
wanted
in
all
those
efforts
at
service
i
was
actuated
by
the
belief
that
it
was
possible
by
such
services
to
gain
a
status
of
full
equality
in
the
empire
for
my
countrymen
the
first
shock
came
in
the
shape
of
the
rowlalt
act
a
law
designed
to
rob
the
people
of
all
real
freedom
i
felt
called
upon
to
lead
an
intensive
agitation
against
it
then
followed
the
punjab
horrors
beginning
with
the
massacre
at
jallianwala
bagh
and
culminating
in
brawling
orders
public
floggings
and
other
indescribable
humiliations
i
discovered
too
that
the
plighted
word
of
the
prime
minister
to
the
mussalmans
of
india
regarding
the
integrity
of
turkey
and
the
holy
places
of
islam
was
not
likely
to
be
fulfilled
but
in
spite
of
the
foreboding
and
the
grave
warnings
of
friends
at
the
amritsar
congress
in
i
fought
for
and
working
the
reforms
hoping
that
the
prime
minister
would
redeem
his
promise
to
the
indian
mussalmans
that
the
punjab
wound
would
be
healed
and
that
the
reforms
inadequate
and
unsatisfactory
though
they
were
marked
a
new
era
of
hope
in
the
life
of
india
but
all
that
hope
was
shattered
the
khilafat
promise
was
not
to
be
redeemed
the
punjab
crime
was
and
most
culprits
went
not
only
unpunished
but
remained
in
service
and
some
continued
to
draw
pensions
from
the
indian
revenue
and
in
some
cases
were
even
rewarded
i
saw
too
that
not
only
did
the
reforms
not
mark
a
change
of
heart
but
they
were
only
a
method
of
further
draining
india
of
her
wealth
and
of
prolonging
her
servitude
i
came
reluctantly
to
the
conclusion
that
the
british
connection
had
made
india
more
helpless
than
she
ever
was
before
politically
and
economically
a
disarmed
india
has
no
power
of
resistance
against
any
aggressor
if
she
wanted
to
engage
in
an
armed
conflict
with
him
so
much
is
this
the
case
that
some
of
our
best
men
consider
that
india
must
take
generations
before
she
can
achieve
the
dominion
status
she
has
become
so
poor
that
she
has
little
power
of
resisting
famines
before
the
british
advent
india
spun
and
wove
in
her
millions
of
cottages
just
the
supplement
she
needed
for
adding
to
her
meagre
agricultural
resources
the
cottage
industry
so
vital
for
india
existence
has
been
ruined
by
incredibly
heartless
and
inhuman
processes
as
described
by
english
witnesses
little
do
know
how
the
masses
of
indians
are
slowly
sinking
to
lifelessness
little
do
they
know
that
their
miserable
comfort
represents
the
brokerage
they
get
for
the
work
they
do
for
the
foreign
exploiter
that
the
profits
and
the
brokerage
are
sucked
from
the
masses
little
do
they
realise
that
the
government
established
by
law
in
british
india
is
carried
on
for
this
exploitation
of
the
masses
no
sophistry
no
jugglery
in
figures
can
explain
away
the
evidence
the
skeletons
in
many
villages
present
to
the
naked
eye
i
have
no
doubt
whatsoever
that
both
england
and
the
town
dwellers
of
india
will
have
to
answer
if
there
is
a
god
above
for
this
crime
against
humanity
which
is
perhaps
unequalled
in
history
the
law
itself
in
this
country
has
been
used
to
serve
the
foreign
exploiter
my
unbiased
examination
of
the
punjab
martial
law
cases
had
led
me
to
believe
that
at
least
per
cent
of
convictions
were
wholly
bad
my
experience
of
political
cases
in
india
leads
me
to
the
conclusion
that
in
nine
out
of
every
ten
the
condemned
men
were
totally
innocent
their
crime
consisted
in
love
of
their
country
in
cases
out
of
hundred
justice
has
been
denied
to
indians
as
against
europeans
in
the
court
of
india
this
is
not
an
exaggerated
picture
it
is
the
experience
of
almost
every
indian
who
has
had
anything
to
do
such
cases
in
my
opinion
the
administration
of
the
law
is
thus
prostituted
consciously
or
unconsciously
for
the
benefit
of
the
exploiter
the
greatest
misfortune
is
that
englishmen
and
their
indian
associates
in
the
administration
of
the
country
do
not
know
that
they
are
engaged
in
the
crime
i
have
attempted
to
describe
i
am
satisfied
that
many
english
and
indian
officials
honestly
believe
that
they
are
administering
one
of
the
best
systems
devised
in
the
world
and
that
india
is
making
steady
though
slow
progress
they
do
not
know
that
a
subtle
but
effective
system
of
terrorism
and
an
organised
display
of
force
on
the
one
hand
and
the
deprivation
of
all
powers
of
retaliation
of
on
the
other
have
emasculated
the
people
and
induced
in
them
the
habit
of
simulation
this
awful
habit
has
added
to
the
ignorance
and
the
of
the
administrators
section
under
which
i
am
happily
charged
is
perhaps
the
prince
among
the
political
sections
of
the
indian
penal
code
designed
to
suppress
the
liberty
of
the
citizen
affection
can
not
be
manufactured
or
regulated
by
law
if
one
has
no
affection
for
a
person
or
thing
one
should
be
free
to
give
the
fullest
expression
to
his
disaffection
so
long
as
he
does
not
contemplate
promote
or
incite
to
violence
but
the
section
under
which
mere
promotion
of
disaffection
is
a
crime
i
have
studied
some
of
the
cases
tried
under
it
and
i
know
that
some
of
the
most
loved
of
india
patriots
have
been
convicted
under
it
i
consider
it
a
privilege
therefore
to
be
charged
under
it
i
have
endeavoured
to
give
in
their
briefest
outline
the
reasons
for
my
disaffection
i
have
no
personal
against
any
single
administrator
much
less
can
i
have
any
disaffection
towards
the
person
but
i
hold
it
to
be
a
virtue
to
be
disaffected
towards
a
government
which
in
its
totality
has
done
more
harm
to
india
than
any
previous
system
india
is
less
manly
under
the
british
rule
than
she
ever
was
before
holding
such
a
belief
i
consider
it
to
be
a
sin
to
have
affection
for
the
system
and
it
has
been
a
precious
privilege
for
me
to
be
able
to
write
what
i
have
in
the
various
articles
tendered
in
evidence
against
me
in
fact
i
believe
that
i
have
rendered
a
service
to
india
and
england
by
showing
in
the
way
out
of
the
unnatural
state
in
which
both
are
living
in
my
humble
opinion
with
evil
is
as
much
a
duty
as
is
with
good
but
in
the
past
has
been
deliberately
expressed
in
violence
to
the
evil
doer
i
am
endeavouring
to
show
to
my
countrymen
that
violent
only
multiplies
evil
and
that
as
evil
can
only
be
sustained
by
violence
withdrawal
of
support
of
evil
requires
complete
abstention
from
violence
implies
voluntary
submission
to
the
penalty
for
with
evil
i
am
here
therefore
to
invite
and
submit
cheerfully
to
the
highest
penalty
that
can
he
inflicted
upon
me
for
what
in
law
is
a
deliberate
crime
and
what
appears
to
me
to
be
the
highest
duty
of
a
citizen
the
only
course
open
to
you
the
judge
and
the
assessors
is
either
to
resign
your
posts
and
thus
dissociate
yourselves
from
evil
if
you
feel
that
the
law
you
are
called
upon
to
administer
is
an
evil
and
that
in
reality
i
am
innocent
or
to
inflict
on
me
the
severest
penalty
if
you
believe
that
the
system
and
the
law
you
are
assisting
to
administer
are
good
for
the
people
of
this
country
and
that
my
activity
is
therefore
injurious
to
the
public
weal
