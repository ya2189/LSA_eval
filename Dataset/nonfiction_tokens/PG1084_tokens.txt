this

true
blues
preface
although
in
putting
forth
this
little
book
we
do
not
claim
that
we
are
filling
a
long
felt
want
yet
we
do
feel
that
its
many
tried
and
true
recipes
from
our
own
housekeepers
will
be
very
welcome
we
also
believe
that
it
will
not
only
be
welcomed
by
those
who
recognize
the
names
and
merits
of
the
various
contributors
but
by
all
housekeepers
young
and
old
there
can
never
be
too
many
helps
for
those
who
three
times
a
day
must
meet
and
answer
the
imperative
question
what
shall
we
eat
to
the
many
who
have
helped
so
willingly
in
the
compilation
of
this
book
the
editorial
committee
would
extend
a
grateful
acknowledgment
for
the
literary
part
of
the
work
we
would
beg
your
indulgence
since
for
each
of
us
it
is
the
first
venture
in
the
making
of
a

all
the

preface
the
best
soups
are
made
with
a
blending
of
many
flavors
do
be
afraid
of
experimenting
with
them
where
you
make
one
mistake
you
will
be
surprised
to
find
the
number
of
successful
varieties
you
can
produce
if
you
like
a
spicy
flavor
try
two
or
three
cloves
or
allspice
or
bay
leaves
all
soups
are
improved
by
a
dash
of
onion
unless
it
is
the
white
soups
or
purees
from
chicken
veal
fish
etc
in
these
celery
may
be
used
in
nothing
so
well
as
soups
can
a
housekeeper
be
economical
of
the
odds
and
ends
of
food
left
from
meals
one
of
the
best
cooks
was
in
the
habit
of
saving
everything
and
announced
one
day
when
her
soup
was
especially
praised
that
it
contained
the
crumbs
of
gingerbread
from
her
cake
box
creamed
onions
left
from
a
dinner
or
a
little
stewed
corn
or
tomatoes
potatoes
fried
or
mashed
a
few
baked
beans
even
a
small

of
apple

often
added

success
will

in

the
ingredients
used

be

the

quality
the
flour
and
always
sifted

fresh
and
sweet

not
too
much
salted
coffee
a
or
granulated

is
best
for
all

much
care
should
be
taken
in
breaking
and
separating
the
eggs
and
equal
care
taken
as
regards
their
freshness
one
imperfect
egg
would
spoil
the
entire
lot
break
each
egg
separately
in
a
teacup
then
into
the
vessels
in
which
they
are
to
be
beaten
never
use
an
egg
when
the
white
is
the
least
discolored
before
beating
the
whites
remove
every
particle
of
yolk
if
any
is
allowed
to
remain
it
will
prevent
them
becoming
as
stiff
and
dry
as
required
deep
earthen
bowls
are
best
for
mixing
cake
and
should
be
kept
exclusively
for
that
purpose
after
using
wash
well
dry
perfectly
and
keep
in
a
dry
place
a
wooden
spoon
or
paddle
is
best
for
beating
batter
before
commencing
to
make
your
cake
see
that
all
the
ingredients
required
are
at
hand
by
so
doing
the
work
may
be
done
in
much
less
time
the
lightness
of
a
cake
depends
not
only
upon
the
making
but
the
baking
also
it
is
highly
important
to
exercise
judgment
respecting
the
heat
of
the
oven
which
must
be
regulated
according
to
the
cake
you
bake
and
the
stove
you
use
solid
cake
requires
sufficient
heat
to
cause
it
to
rise
and
brown
nicely
without
scorching
if
it
should
brown
too
fast
cover
with
thick
brown
paper
all
light
cakes
require
quick
heat
and
are
not
good
if
baked
in
a
cool
oven
those
having
molasses
as
an
ingredient
scorch
more
quickly
consequently
should
be
baked
in
a
moderate
oven
every
cook
should
use
her
own
judgment
and
by
frequent
baking
she
will
in
a
very
short
time
be
able
to
tell
by
the
appearance
of
either
bread
or
cake
whether
it
is
sufficiently
done
