preface
whoever
has
had
an
opportunity
of
becoming
acquainted
with
the
mental
condition
of
the
intelligent
classes
in
europe
and
america
must
have
perceived
that
there
is
a
great
and
departure
from
the
public
religious
faith
and
that
while
among
the
more
frank
this
divergence
is
not
concealed
there
is
a
far
more
extensive
and
far
more
dangerous
secession
private
and
unacknowledged
so
and
so
powerful
is
this
secession
that
it
can
neither
be
treated
with
contempt
nor
with
punishment
it
can
not
be
extinguished
by
derision
by
vituperation
or
by
force
the
time
is
rapidly
approaching
when
it
will
give
rise
to
serious
political
results
ecclesiastical
spirit
no
longer
inspires
the
policy
of
the
world
military
fervor
in
behalf
of
faith
has
disappeared
its
only
souvenirs
are
the
marble
effigies
of
crusading
knights
reposing
in
the
silent
crypts
of
churches
on
their
tombs
that
a
crisis
is
impending
is
shown
by
the
attitude
of
the
great
powers
toward
the
papacy
the
papacy
represents
the
ideas
and
aspirations
of
of
the
population
of
europe
it
insists
on
a
political
supremacy
in
accordance
with
its
claims
to
a
divine
origin
and
mission
and
a
restoration
of
the
mediaeval
order
of
things
loudly
declaring
that
it
will
accept
no
reconciliation
with
modern
civilization
the
antagonism
we
thus
witness
between
religion
and
science
is
the
continuation
of
a
struggle
that
commenced
when
christianity
began
to
attain
political
power
a
divine
revelation
must
necessarily
be
intolerant
of
contradiction
it
must
repudiate
all
improvement
in
itself
and
view
with
disdain
that
arising
from
the
progressive
intellectual
development
of
man
but
our
opinions
on
every
subject
are
continually
liable
to
modification
from
the
irresistible
advance
of
human
knowledge
can
we
exaggerate
the
importance
of
a
contention
in
which
every
thoughtful
person
must
take
part
whether
he
will
or
not
in
a
matter
so
solemn
as
that
of
religion
all
men
whose
temporal
interests
are
not
involved
in
existing
institutions
earnestly
desire
to
find
the
truth
they
seek
information
as
to
the
subjects
in
dispute
and
as
to
the
conduct
of
the
disputants
the
history
of
science
is
not
a
mere
record
of
isolated
discoveries
it
is
a
narrative
of
the
conflict
of
two
contending
powers
the
expansive
force
of
the
human
intellect
on
one
side
and
the
compression
arising
from
traditionary
faith
and
human
interests
on
the
other
no
one
has
hitherto
treated
the
subject
from
this
point
of
view
yet
from
this
point
it
presents
itself
to
us
as
a
living
issue
in
fact
as
the
most
important
of
all
living
issues
a
few
years
ago
it
was
the
politic
and
therefore
the
proper
course
to
abstain
from
all
allusion
to
this
controversy
and
to
keep
it
as
far
as
possible
in
the
background
the
tranquillity
of
society
depends
so
much
on
the
stability
of
its
religious
convictions
that
no
one
can
be
justified
in
wantonly
disturbing
them
but
faith
is
in
its
nature
unchangeable
stationary
science
is
in
its
nature
progressive
and
eventually
a
divergence
between
them
impossible
to
conceal
must
take
place
it
then
becomes
the
duty
of
those
whose
lives
have
made
them
familiar
with
both
modes
of
thought
to
present
modestly
but
firmly
their
views
to
compare
the
antagonistic
pretensions
calmly
impartially
philosophically
history
shows
that
if
this
be
not
done
social
misfortunes
disastrous
and
enduring
will
ensue
when
the
old
mythological
religion
of
europe
broke
down
under
the
weight
of
its
own
inconsistencies
neither
the
roman
emperors
nor
the
philosophers
of
those
times
did
any
thing
adequate
for
the
guidance
of
public
opinion
they
left
religious
affairs
to
take
their
chance
and
accordingly
those
affairs
fell
into
the
hands
of
ignorant
and
infuriated
ecclesiastics
parasites
eunuchs
and
slaves
the
intellectual
night
which
settled
on
europe
in
consequence
of
that
great
neglect
of
duty
is
passing
away
we
live
in
the
daybreak
of
better
things
society
is
anxiously
expecting
light
to
see
in
what
direction
it
is
drifting
it
plainly
discerns
that
the
track
along
which
the
voyage
of
civilization
has
thus
far
been
made
has
been
left
and
that
a
new
departure
on
all
unknown
sea
has
been
taken
though
deeply
impressed
with
such
thoughts
i
should
not
have
presumed
to
write
this
book
or
to
intrude
on
the
public
the
ideas
it
presents
had
i
not
made
the
facts
with
which
it
deals
a
subject
of
long
and
earnest
meditation
and
i
have
gathered
a
strong
incentive
to
undertake
this
duty
from
the
circumstance
that
a
history
of
the
intellectual
development
of
europe
published
by
me
several
years
ago
which
has
passed
through
many
editions
in
america
and
has
been
reprinted
in
numerous
european
languages
english
french
german
russian
polish
servian
is
everywhere
received
with
favor
in
collecting
and
arranging
the
materials
for
the
volumes
i
published
under
the
title
of
a
history
of
the
american
civil
war
a
work
of
very
great
labor
i
had
become
accustomed
to
the
comparison
of
conflicting
statements
the
adjustment
of
conflicting
claims
the
approval
with
which
that
book
has
been
received
by
the
american
public
a
critical
judge
of
the
events
considered
has
inspired
me
with
additional
confidence
i
had
also
devoted
much
attention
to
the
experimental
investigation
of
natural
phenomena
and
had
published
many
memoirs
on
such
subjects
and
perhaps
no
one
can
give
himself
to
these
pursuits
and
spend
a
large
part
of
his
life
in
the
public
teaching
of
science
without
partaking
of
that
love
of
impartiality
and
truth
which
philosophy
incites
she
inspires
us
with
a
desire
to
dedicate
our
days
to
the
good
of
our
race
so
that
in
the
fading
light
of
life
evening
we
may
not
on
looking
back
be
forced
to
acknowledge
how
unsubstantial
and
useless
are
the
objects
that
we
have
pursued
though
i
have
spared
no
pains
in
the
composition
of
this
book
i
am
very
sensible
how
unequal
it
is
to
the
subject
to
do
justice
to
which
a
knowledge
of
science
history
theology
politics
is
required
every
page
should
be
alive
with
intelligence
and
glistening
with
facts
but
then
i
have
remembered
that
this
is
only
as
it
were
the
preface
or
forerunner
of
a
body
of
literature
which
the
events
and
wants
of
our
times
will
call
forth
we
have
come
to
the
brink
of
a
great
intellectual
change
much
of
the
frivolous
reading
of
the
present
will
be
supplanted
by
a
thoughtful
and
austere
literature
vivified
by
endangered
interests
and
made
fervid
by
ecclesiastical
passion
what
i
have
sought
to
do
is
to
present
a
clear
and
impartial
statement
of
the
views
and
acts
of
the
two
contending
parties
in
one
sense
i
have
tried
to
identify
myself
with
each
so
as
to
comprehend
thoroughly
their
motives
but
in
another
and
higher
sense
i
have
endeavored
to
stand
aloof
and
relate
with
impartiality
their
actions
i
therefore
trust
that
those
who
may
be
disposed
to
criticise
this
book
will
bear
in
mind
that
its
object
is
not
to
advocate
the
views
and
pretensions
of
either
party
but
to
explain
clearly
and
without
shrinking
those
of
both
in
the
management
of
each
chapter
i
have
usually
set
forth
the
orthodox
view
first
and
then
followed
it
with
that
of
its
opponents
in
thus
treating
the
subject
it
has
not
been
necessary
to
pay
much
regard
to
more
moderate
or
intermediate
opinions
for
though
they
may
be
intrinsically
of
great
value
in
conflicts
of
this
kind
it
is
not
with
the
moderates
but
with
the
extremists
that
the
impartial
reader
is
mainly
concerned
their
movements
determine
the
issue
for
this
reason
i
have
had
little
to
say
respecting
the
two
great
christian
confessions
the
protestant
and
greek
churches
as
to
the
latter
it
has
never
since
the
restoration
of
science
arrayed
itself
in
opposition
to
the
advancement
of
knowledge
on
the
contrary
it
has
always
met
it
with
welcome
it
has
observed
a
reverential
attitude
to
truth
from
whatever
quarter
it
might
come
recognizing
the
apparent
discrepancies
between
its
interpretations
of
revealed
truth
and
the
discoveries
of
science
it
has
always
expected
that
satisfactory
explanations
and
reconciliations
would
ensue
and
in
this
it
has
not
been
disappointed
it
would
have
been
well
for
modern
civilization
if
the
roman
church
had
done
the
same
in
speaking
of
christianity
reference
is
generally
made
to
the
roman
church
partly
because
its
adherents
compose
the
majority
of
christendom
partly
because
its
demands
are
the
most
pretentious
and
partly
because
it
has
commonly
sought
to
enforce
those
demands
by
the
civil
power
none
of
the
protestant
churches
has
ever
occupied
a
position
so
imperious
none
has
ever
had
such
political
influence
for
the
most
part
they
have
been
averse
to
constraint
and
except
in
very
few
instances
their
opposition
has
not
passed
beyond
the
exciting
of
theological
odium
as
to
science
she
has
never
sought
to
ally
herself
to
civil
power
she
has
never
attempted
to
throw
odium
or
inflict
social
ruin
on
any
human
being
she
has
never
subjected
any
one
to
mental
torment
physical
torture
least
of
all
to
death
for
the
purpose
of
upholding
or
promoting
her
ideas
she
presents
herself
unstained
by
cruelties
and
crimes
but
in
the
vatican
we
have
only
to
recall
the
inquisition
the
hands
that
are
now
raised
in
appeals
to
the
most
merciful
are
crimsoned
they
have
been
steeped
in
blood
there
are
two
modes
of
historical
composition
the
artistic
and
the
scientific
the
former
implies
that
men
give
origin
to
events
it
therefore
selects
some
prominent
individual
pictures
him
under
a
fanciful
form
and
makes
him
the
hero
of
a
romance
the
latter
insisting
that
human
affairs
present
an
unbroken
chain
in
which
each
fact
is
the
offspring
of
some
preceding
fact
and
the
parent
of
some
subsequent
fact
declares
that
men
do
not
control
events
but
that
events
control
men
the
former
gives
origin
to
compositions
which
however
much
they
may
interest
or
delight
us
are
but
a
grade
above
novels
the
latter
is
austere
perhaps
even
repulsive
for
it
sternly
impresses
us
with
a
conviction
of
the
irresistible
dominion
of
law
and
the
insignificance
of
human
exertions
in
a
subject
so
solemn
as
that
to
which
this
book
is
devoted
the
romantic
and
the
popular
are
altogether
out
of
place
he
who
presumes
to
treat
of
it
must
fix
his
eyes
steadfastly
on
that
chain
of
destiny
which
universal
history
displays
he
must
turn
with
disdain
from
the
phantom
impostures
of
pontiffs
and
statesmen
and
kings
if
any
thing
were
needed
to
show
us
the
untrustworthiness
of
artistic
historical
compositions
our
personal
experience
would
furnish
it
how
often
do
our
most
intimate
friends
fail
to
perceive
the
real
motives
of
our
actions
how
frequently
they
misinterpret
our
intentions
if
this
be
the
case
in
what
is
passing
before
our
eyes
may
we
not
be
satisfied
that
it
is
impossible
to
comprehend
justly
the
doings
of
persons
who
lived
many
years
ago
and
whom
we
have
never
seen
in
selecting
and
arranging
the
topics
now
to
be
presented
i
have
been
guided
in
part
by
the
confession
of
the
late
vatican
council
and
in
part
by
the
order
of
events
in
history
not
without
interest
will
the
reader
remark
that
the
subjects
offer
themselves
to
us
now
as
they
did
to
the
old
philosophers
of
greece
we
still
deal
with
the
same
questions
about
which
they
disputed
what
is
god
what
is
the
soul
what
is
the
world
how
is
it
governed
have
we
any
standard
or
criterion
of
truth
and
the
thoughtful
reader
will
earnestly
ask
are
our
solutions
of
these
problems
any
better
than
theirs
the
general
argument
of
this
book
then
is
as
follows
i
first
direct
attention
to
the
origin
of
modern
science
as
distinguished
from
ancient
by
depending
on
observation
experiment
and
mathematical
discussion
instead
of
mere
speculation
and
shall
show
that
it
was
a
consequence
of
the
macedonian
campaigns
which
brought
asia
and
europe
into
contact
a
brief
sketch
of
those
campaigns
and
of
the
museum
of
alexandria
illustrates
its
character
then
with
brevity
i
recall
the
origin
of
christianity
and
show
its
advance
to
the
attainment
of
imperial
power
the
transformation
it
underwent
by
its
incorporation
with
paganism
the
existing
religion
of
the
roman
empire
a
clear
conception
of
its
incompatibility
with
science
caused
it
to
suppress
forcibly
the
schools
of
alexandria
it
was
constrained
to
this
by
the
political
necessities
of
its
position
the
parties
to
the
conflict
thus
placed
i
next
relate
the
story
of
their
first
open
struggle
it
is
the
first
or
southern
reformation
the
point
in
dispute
had
respect
to
the
nature
of
god
it
involved
the
rise
of
mohammedanism
its
result
was
that
much
of
asia
and
africa
with
the
historic
cities
jerusalem
alexandria
and
carthage
were
wrenched
from
christendom
and
the
doctrine
of
the
unity
of
god
established
in
the
larger
portion
of
what
had
been
the
roman
empire
this
political
event
was
followed
by
the
restoration
of
science
the
establishment
of
colleges
schools
libraries
throughout
the
dominions
of
the
arabians
those
conquerors
pressing
forward
rapidly
in
their
intellectual
development
rejected
the
anthropomorphic
ideas
of
the
nature
of
god
remaining
in
their
popular
belief
and
accepted
other
more
philosophical
ones
akin
to
those
that
had
long
previously
been
attained
to
in
india
the
result
of
this
was
a
second
conflict
that
respecting
the
nature
of
the
soul
under
the
designation
of
averroism
there
came
into
prominence
the
theories
of
emanation
and
absorption
at
the
close
of
the
middle
ages
the
inquisition
succeeded
in
excluding
those
doctrines
from
europe
and
now
the
vatican
council
has
formally
and
solemnly
anathematized
them
meantime
through
the
cultivation
of
astronomy
geography
and
other
sciences
correct
views
had
been
gained
as
to
the
position
and
relations
of
the
earth
and
as
to
the
structure
of
the
world
and
since
religion
resting
itself
on
what
was
assumed
to
be
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
scriptures
insisted
that
the
earth
is
the
central
and
most
important
part
of
the
universe
a
third
conflict
broke
out
in
this
galileo
led
the
way
on
the
part
of
science
its
issue
was
the
overthrow
of
the
church
on
the
question
in
dispute
subsequently
a
subordinate
controversy
arose
respecting
the
age
of
the
world
the
church
insisting
that
it
is
only
about
six
thousand
years
old
in
this
she
was
again
overthrown
the
light
of
history
and
of
science
had
been
gradually
spreading
over
europe
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
prestige
of
roman
christianity
was
greatly
diminished
by
the
intellectual
reverses
it
had
experienced
and
also
by
its
political
and
moral
condition
it
was
clearly
seen
by
many
pious
men
that
religion
was
not
accountable
for
the
false
position
in
which
she
was
found
but
that
the
misfortune
was
directly
traceable
to
the
alliance
she
had
of
old
contracted
with
roman
paganism
the
obvious
remedy
therefore
was
a
return
to
primitive
purity
thus
arose
the
fourth
conflict
known
to
us
as
the
reformation
the
second
or
northern
reformation
the
special
form
it
assumed
was
a
contest
respecting
the
standard
or
criterion
of
truth
whether
it
is
to
be
found
in
the
church
or
in
the
bible
the
determination
of
this
involved
a
settlement
of
the
rights
of
reason
or
intellectual
freedom
luther
who
is
the
conspicuous
man
of
the
epoch
carried
into
effect
his
intention
with
no
inconsiderable
success
and
at
the
close
of
the
struggle
it
was
found
that
northern
europe
was
lost
to
roman
christianity
we
are
now
in
the
midst
of
a
controversy
respecting
the
mode
of
government
of
the
world
whether
it
be
by
incessant
divine
intervention
or
by
the
operation
of
primordial
and
unchangeable
law
the
intellectual
movement
of
christendom
has
reached
that
point
which
arabism
had
attained
to
in
the
tenth
and
eleventh
centuries
and
doctrines
which
were
then
discussed
are
presenting
themselves
again
for
review
such
are
those
of
evolution
creation
development
offered
under

titles
i
think
it
will
be
found
that
all
the
essential
points
of
this
great
controversy
are
included
by
grouping
under
these
comprehensive
heads
the
facts
to
be
considered
and
dealing
with
each
group
separately
we
shall
doubtless
acquire
clear
views
of
their
and
their
historical
succession
i
have
treated
of
these
conflicts
as
nearly
as
i
conveniently
could
in
their
proper
chronological
order
and
for
the
sake
of
completeness
have
added
chapters
on
an
examination
of
what
latin
christianity
has
done
for
modern
civilization
a
corresponding
examination
of
what
science
has
done
the
attitude
of
roman
christianity
in
the
impending
conflict
as
defined
by
the
vatican
council
the
attention
of
many
persons
has
been
so
exclusively
given
to
the
details
of
sectarian
dissensions
that
the
long
strife
to
the
history
of
which
these

are
devoted
is
popularly
but
little
known

tried
to
keep
steadfastly
in

the

write
this

greece
was
fast
outgrowing
her
ancient
faith
her
philosophers
in
their
studies
of
the
world
had
been
profoundly
impressed
with
the
contrast
between
the
majesty
of
the
operations
of

and
the
worthlessness
of
the
divinities
of

to
suspect
that
the
miracles
and
celestial
interventions
with
which
the
old
annals
were
filled
were
only
fictions
they
demanded
when
the
age
of
the
supernatural
had
ceased
why
oracles
had
become
mute
and
why
there
were
now
no
more
prodigies
in
the

traditions
descending
from
immemorial
antiquity
and
formerly
accepted
by
pious
men
as
unquestionable

filled

over

the

that
had
been

in

and

were
found
to

of

and

but
this
did
not
take
place
without
resistance
at
first
the
public
and
particularly
its
religious
portion
denounced
the
rising
doubts
as
atheism
they
despoiled
some
of
the
offenders
of
their
goods
exiled
others
some
they
put
to
death
they
asserted
that
what
had
been
believed
by
pious
men
in
the
old
times
and
had
stood
the
test
of
ages
must
necessarily
be
true
then
as
the
opposing
evidence
became
irresistible
they
were
content
to
admit
that
these
marvels
were
allegories
under
which
the
wisdom
of
the
ancients
had
concealed
many
sacred
and
mysterious
things
they
tried
to
reconcile
what
now
in
their
misgivings
they
feared
might
be
myths
with
their
advancing
intellectual
state
but
their
efforts
were
in
vain
for
there
are
predestined
phases
through
which
on
such
an
occasion
public
opinion
must
pass
what
it
has
received
with
veneration
it
begins
to
doubt
then
it
offers
new
interpretations
then
subsides
into
dissent
and
ends
with
a
rejection
of
the
whole
as
a
mere
fable
in
their
secession
the
philosophers
and
historians
were
followed
by
the
poets
euripides
incurred

odium
of

escaped
being
stoned
to

for

but
the
frantic
efforts
of
those
who
are
interested
in
supporting
delusions
must
always
end
in
defeat
the
demoralization
resistlessly
extended
through
every
branch
of
literature
until
at
length
it
reached
the
common
people
the
persian
empire
greek
philosophical
criticism
had
lent
its
aid
to
greek
philosophical
discovery
in
this
destruction
of
the
national
faith
it
sustained
by
many
arguments
the
unbelief
it
compared
the
doctrines
of
the
different
schools
with
each
other
and
showed
from
their
contradictions
that
man
has
no
criterion
of
truth
that
since
his
ideas
of
what
is
good
and
what
is
evil
differ
according
to
the
country
in
which
he
lives
they
can
have
no
foundation
in
nature
but
must
be
altogether
the
result
of
education
that
right
and
wrong
are
nothing
more
than
fictions
created
by
society
for
its
own
purposes
in
athens
some
of
the
more
advanced
classes
had
reached
such
a
pass
that
they
not
only
denied
the
unseen
the
supernatural
they
even
affirmed
that
the
world
is
only
a
a
phantasm
and
that
nothing
at
all
exists
the
topographical
configuration
of
greece
gave
an
impress
to
her
political
condition
it
divided
her
people
into
distinct
communities
having
conflicting
interests
and
made
them
incapable
of
centralization
incessant
domestic
wars
between
the
rival
states
checked
her
advancement
she
was
poor
her
leading
men
had
become
corrupt
they
were
ever
ready
to
barter
patriotic
considerations
for
foreign
gold
to
sell
themselves
for
persian
bribes
possessing
a
perception
of
the
beautiful
as
manifested
in
sculpture
and
architecture
to
a
degree
never
attained
elsewhere
either
before
or
since
greece
had
lost
a
practical
appreciation
of
the
good
and
the
true
while
european
greece
full
of
ideas
of
liberty
and
independence
rejected
the
sovereignty
of
persia
asiatic
greece
acknowledged
it
without
reluctance
at
that
time
the
persian
empire
in
territorial
extent
was
equal
to
half
of
modern
europe
it
touched
the
waters
of
the
mediterranean
the
aegean
the
black
the
caspian
the
indian
the
persian
the
red
seas
through
its
territories
there
flowed
six
of
the
grandest
rivers
in
the
world
the
euphrates
the
tigris
the
indus
the
jaxartes
the
oxus
the
nile
each
more
than
a
thousand
miles
in
length
its
surface
reached
from
thirteen
hundred
feet
below
the
to
twenty
thousand
feet
above
it
yielded
therefore
every
agricultural
product
its
mineral
wealth
was
boundless
it
inherited
the
prestige
of
the
median
the
babylonian
the
assyrian
the
chaldean
empires
whose
annals
reached
back
through
more
than
twenty
centuries
the
persian
empire
persia
had
always
looked
upon
european
greece
as
politically
insignificant
for
it
had
scarcely
half
the
territorial
extent
of
one
of
her
satrapies
her
expeditions
for
compelling
its
obedience
had
however
taught
her
the
military
qualities
of
its
people
in
her
forces
were
incorporated
greek
mercenaries
esteemed
the
very
best
of
her
troops
she
did
not
hesitate
sometimes
to
give
the
command
of
her
armies
to
greek
generals
of
her
fleets
to
greek
captains
in
the
political
convulsions
through
which
she
had
passed
greek
soldiers
had
often
been
used
by
her
contending
chiefs
these
military
operations
were
attended
by
a
momentous
result
they
revealed
to
the
quick
eye
of
these
warlike
mercenaries
the
political
weakness
of
the
empire
and
the
possibility
of
reaching
its
centre
after
the
death
of
cyrus
on
the
of
cunaxa
it
was
demonstrated
by
the
immortal
retreat
of
the
ten
thousand
under
xenophon
that
a
greek
army
could
force
its
way
to
and
from
the
heart
of
persia
that
reverence
for
the
military
abilities
of
asiatic
generals
so
profoundly
impressed
on
the
greeks
by
such
engineering
exploits
as
the
bridging
of
the
hellespont
and
the
cutting
of
the
isthmus
at
mount
athos
by
xerxes
had
been
obliterated
at
salamis
platea
mycale
to
plunder
rich
persian
provinces
had
become
an
irresistible
temptation
such
was
the
expedition
of
agesilaus
the
spartan
king
whose
brilliant
successes
were
however
checked
by
the
persian
government
resorting
to
its
policy
of
bribing
the
neighbors
of
sparta
to
attack
her
i
have
been
conquered
by
thirty
thousand
persian
archers
bitterly
exclaimed
agesilaus
as
he
alluding
to
the
persian
coin
the
daric
which
was
stamped
with
the
image
of
an
archer
the
invasion
of
persia
by
greece
at
length
philip
the
king
of
macedon
projected
a
renewal
of
these
attempts
under
a
far
more
formidable
organization
and
with
a
grander
object
he
managed
to
have
himself
appointed
of
all
greece
not
for
the
purpose
of
a
mere
foray
into
the
asiatic
satrapies
but
for
the
overthrow
of
the
persian
dynasty
in
the
very
centre
of
its
power
assassinated
while
his
preparations
were
incomplete
he
was
succeeded
by
his
son
alexander
then
a
youth
a
general
assembly
of
greeks
at
corinth
had
unanimously
elected
him
in
his
father
stead
there
were
some
disturbances
in
illyria
alexander
had
to
march
his
army
as
far
north
as
the
danube
to
quell
them
during
his
absence
the
thebans
with
some
others
conspired
against
him
on
his
return
he
took
thebes
by
assault
he
massacred
six
thousand
of
its
inhabitants
sold
thirty
thousand
for
slaves
and
utterly
demolished
the
city
the
military
wisdom
of
this
severity
was
apparent
in
his
asiatic
campaign
he
was
not
troubled
by
any
revolt
in
his
rear
the
macedonian
campaign
in
the
spring
alexander
crossed
the
hellespont
into
asia
his
army
consisted
of
thousand
foot
and
four
thousand
horse
he
had
with
him
only
seventy
talents
in
money
he
marched
directly
on
the
persian
army
which
vastly
exceeding
him
in
strength
was
holding
the
line
of
the
granicus
he
forced
the
passage
of
the
river
routed
the
enemy
and
the
possession
of
all
asia
minor
with
its
treasures
was
the
fruit
of
the
victory
the
remainder
of
that
year
he
spent
in
the
military
organization
of
the
conquered
provinces
meantime
darius
the
persian
king
had
advanced
an
army
of
six
hundred
thousand
men
to
prevent
the
passage
of
the
macedonians
into
syria
in
a
battle
that
ensued
among
the
at
issus
the
persians
were
again
overthrown
so
great
was
the
slaughter
that
alexander
and
ptolemy
one
of
his
generals
crossed
over
a
ravine
choked
with
dead
bodies
it
was
estimated
that
the
persian
loss
was
not
less
than
ninety
thousand
foot
and
ten
thousand
horse
the
royal
pavilion
fell
into
the
conqueror
hands
and
with
it
the
wife
and
several
of
the
children
of
darius
syria
was
thus
added
to
the
greek
conquests
in
damascus
were
found
many
of
the
concubines
of
darius
and
his
chief
officers
together
with
a
vast
treasure
before
venturing
into
the
plains
of
mesopotamia
for
the
final
struggle
alexander
to
secure
his
rear
and
preserve
his
communications
with
the
sea
marched
southward
down
the
mediterranean
coast
reducing
the
cities
in
his
way
in
his
speech
before
the
council
of
war
after
issus
he
told
his
generals
that
they
must
not
pursue
darius
with
tyre
unsubdued
and
persia
in
possession
of
egypt
and
cyprus
for
if
persia
should
regain
her
seaports
she
would
transfer
the
war
into
greece
and
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
him
to
be
sovereign
at
sea
with
cyprus
and
egypt
in
his
possession
he
felt
no
solicitude
about
greece
the
siege
of
tyre
cost
him
more
than
half
a
year
in
revenge
for
this
delay
he
crucified
it
is
said
two
thousand
of
his
prisoners
jerusalem
voluntarily
surrendered
and
therefore
was
treated
leniently
but
the
passage
of
the
macedonian
army
into
egypt
being
obstructed
at
gaza
the
persian
governor
of
which
betis
made
a
most
obstinate
defense
that
place
after
a
siege
of
two
months
was
carried
by
assault
ten
thousand
of
its
men
were
massacred
and
the
rest
with
their
wives
and
children
sold
into
slavery
betis
himself
was
dragged
alive
round
the
city
at
the
of
the
conqueror
there
was
now
no
further
obstacle
the
egyptians
who
detested
the
persian
rule
received
their
invader
with
open
arms
he
organized
the
country
in
his
own
interest
intrusting
all
its
military
commands
to
macedonian
officers
and
leaving
the
civil
government
in
the
hands
of
native
egyptians
conquest
of
egypt
while
preparations
for
the
final
campaign
were
being
made
he
undertook
a
journey
to
the
temple
of
jupiter
ammon
which
was
situated
in
an
oasis
of
the
libyan
desert
at
a
distance
of
two
hundred
miles
the
oracle
declared
him
to
be
a
son
of
that
god
who
under
the
form
of
a
serpent
had
beguiled
olympias
his
mother
immaculate
conceptions
and
celestial
descents
were
so
currently
received
in
those
days
that
whoever
had
greatly
distinguished
himself
in
the
affairs
of
men
was
thought
to
be
of
supernatural
lineage
even
in
rome
centuries
later
no
one
could
with
safety
have
denied
that
the
city
owed
its
founder
romulus
to
an
accidental
meeting
of
the
god
mars
with
the
virgin
rhea
sylvia
as
she
went
with
her
pitcher
for
water
to
the
spring
the
egyptian
disciples
of
plato
would
have
looked
with
anger
on
those
who
rejected
the
legend
that
perictione
the
mother
of
that
great
philosopher
a
pure
virgin
had
suffered
an
immaculate
conception
through
the
influences
of
apollo
and
that
the
god
had
declared
to
ariston
to
whom
she
was
betrothed
the
parentage
of
the
child
when
alexander
issued
his
letters
orders
and
decrees
styling
himself
king
alexander
the
son
of
jupiter
ammon
they
came
to
the
inhabitants
of
egypt
and
syria
with
an
authority
that
now
can
hardly
be
realized
the
greeks
however
put
on
such
a
supernatural
pedigree
its
proper
value
olympias
who
of
course
better
than
all
others
knew
the
facts
of
the
case
used
jestingly
to
say
that
she
wished
alexander
would
cease
from
incessantly
embroiling
her
with
jupiter

arrian
the
historian
of
the
macedonian
expedition
observes
i
can
not
condemn
him
for
endeavoring
to
draw
his
subjects
into
the
belief
of
his
divine
origin
nor
can
i
be
induced
to
think
it
any
great
crime
for
it
is
very
reasonable
to
imagine
that
he
intended
no
more
by
it
than
merely
to
procure
the
greater
authority
among
his
soldiers
greek
conquest
of
persia
all
things
being
thus
secured

his

alexander
having
returned
into
syria
directed
the
march
of
his
army
now
consisting
of
fifty
thousand
veterans
eastward
after
crossing
the
euphrates
he
kept
close
to
the
masian
hills
to
avoid
the
intense
heat
of
the
more
southerly

plains
more
abundant
forage

also
thus
be
procured
for
the

the
true
origin
of

we
trace
back
all
our
exact
knowledge
to
the
macedonian
campaigns
humboldt
has
well
observed
that
an
introduction
to
new
and
grand
objects
of
nature
enlarges
the
human
mind
the
soldiers
of
alexander
and
the
hosts
of
his
encountered
at
every
march
unexpected
and
picturesque
scenery
of
all
men
the
greeks
were
the
most
observant
the
most
readily
and
profoundly
impressed
here
there
were
interminable
sandy
plains
there
mountains
whose
peaks
were
lost
above
the
clouds
in
the
deserts
were
mirages
on
the
shadows
of
fleeting
clouds
sweeping
over
the
forests
they
were
in
a
land
of
and
cypresses
of
tamarisks
green
myrtles
and
oleanders
at
arbela
they
had
fought
against
indian
elephants
in
the
thickets
of
the
caspian
they
had
roused
from
his
lair
the
lurking
royal
tiger
they
had
seen
animals
which
compared
with
those
of
europe
were
not
only
strange
but
colossal
the
rhinoceros
the
hippopotamus
the
camel
the
crocodiles
of
the
nile
and
the
ganges
they
had
encountered
men
of
many
complexions
and
many
costumes
the
swarthy
syrian
the
persian
the
black
african
even
of
alexander
himself
it
is
related
that
on
his
he
caused
his
admiral
nearchus
to
sit
by
his
side
and
found
consolation
in
listening
to
the
adventures
of
that
sailor
the
story
of
his
voyage
from
the
indus
up
the
persian
gulf
the
conqueror
had
seen
with
astonishment
the
ebbing
and
flowing
of
the
tides
he
had
built
ships
for
the
exploration
of
the
caspian
supposing
that
it
and
the
black
sea
might
be
gulfs
of
a
great
ocean
such
as
nearchus
had
discovered
the
persian
and
red
seas
to
be
he
had
formed
a
resolution
that
his
fleet
should
attempt
the
circumnavigation
of
africa
and
come
into
the
mediterranean
through
the
pillars
of
hercules
a
feat
which
it
was
affirmed
had
once
been
accomplished
by
the
pharaohs
intellectual
condition
of
persia
not
only
her
greatest
soldiers
but
also
her
greatest
philosophers
found
in
the
conquered
empire
much
that
might
excite
the
admiration
of
greece
callisthenes
obtained
in
babylon
a
series
of
chaldean
astronomical
observations
ranging
back
through
years
these
he
sent
to
aristotle
perhaps
since
they
were
on
burnt
bricks
duplicates
of
them
may
be
recovered
by
modern
research
in
the
clay
libraries
of
the
assyrian
kings
ptolemy
the
egyptian
astronomer
possessed
a
babylonian
record
of
eclipses
going
back
years
before
our
era
and
close
observations
were
necessary
before
some
of
these
astronomical
results
that
have
reached
our
times
could
have
been
ascertained
thus
the
babylonians
had
fixed
the
length
of
a
tropical
year
within
seconds
of
the
truth
their
estimate
of
the
sidereal
year
was
barely
two
minutes
in
excess
they
had
detected
the
precession
of
the
equinoxes
they
knew
the
causes
of
eclipses
and
by
the
aid
of
their
cycle
called
saros
could
predict
them
their
estimate
of
the
value
of
that
cycle
which
is
more
than
days
was
within
nineteen
and
a
half
minutes
of
the
truth
intellectual
condition
of
persia
such
facts
furnish
incontrovertible
proof
of
the
patience
and
skill
with
which
astronomy
had
been
cultivated
in
mesopotamia
and
that
with
very
inadequate
instrumental
means
it
had
reached
no
inconsiderable
perfection
these
old
observers
had
made
a
catalogue
of
the
stars
had
divided
the
zodiac
into
twelve
signs
they
had
parted
the
day
into
twelve
hours
the
night
into
twelve
they
had
as
aristotle
says
for
a
long
time
devoted
themselves
to
observations
of
by
the
moon
they
had
correct
views
of
the
structure
of
the
solar
system
and
knew
the
order
of
the
emplacement
of
the
planets
they
constructed
sundials
clepsydras
astrolabes
gnomons
not
without
interest
do
we
still
look
on
specimens
of
their
method
of
printing
upon
a
revolving
roller
they
engraved
in
cuneiform
letters
their
records
and
running
this
over
plastic
clay
formed
into
blocks
produced
ineffaceable
proofs
from
their
we
are
still
to
reap
a
literary
and
historical
harvest
they
were
not
without
some
knowledge
of
optics
the
convex
lens
found
at
nimroud
shows
that
they
were
not
unacquainted
with
magnifying
instruments
in
arithmetic
they
had
detected
the
value
of
position
in
the
digits
though
they
missed
the
grand
indian
invention
of
the
cipher
what
a
spectacle
for
the
conquering
greeks
who
up
to
this
time
had
neither
experimented
nor
observed
they
had
contented
themselves
with
mere
meditation
and
useless
speculation
its
religious
condition
but
greek
intellectual
development
due
thus
in
part
to
a
more
extended
view
of
nature
was
powerfully
aided
by
the
knowledge
then
acquired
of
the
religion
of
the
conquered
country
the
idolatry
of
greece
had
always
been
a
horror
to
persia
who
in
her
invasions
had
never
failed
to
destroy
the
temples
and
insult
the
fanes
of
the
bestial
gods
the
impunity
with
which
these
sacrileges
had
been
perpetrated
had
made
a
profound
impression
and
did
no
little
to
undermine
hellenic
faith
but
now
the
worshiper
of
the
vile
olympian
divinities
whose
obscene
lives
must
have
been
shocking
to
every
pious
man
was
brought
in
contact
with
a
grand
a
solemn
a
consistent
religious
system
having
its
foundation
on
a
philosophical
basis
persia
as
is
the
case
with
all
empires
of
long
duration
had
passed
through
many
changes
of
religion
she
had
followed
the
monotheism
of
zoroaster
had
then
accepted
dualism
and
exchanged
that
for
magianism
at
the
time
of
the
macedonian
expedition
she
recognized
one
universal
intelligence
the
creator
preserver
and
governor
of
all
things
the
most
holy
essence
of
truth
the
giver
of
all
good
he
was
not
to
be
represented
by
any
image
or
any
graven
form
and
since
in
every
thing
here
below
we
see
the
resultant
of
two
opposing
forces
under
him
were
two
coequal
and
coeternal
principles
represented
by
the
imagery
of
light
and
darkness
these
principles
are
in
conflict
the
world
is
their
man
is
their
prize
in
the
old
legends
of
dualism
the
evil
spirit
was
said
to
have
sent
a
serpent
to
ruin
the
paradise
which
the
good
spirit
had
made
these
legends
became
known
to
the
jews
during
their
babylonian
captivity
the
existence
of
a
principle
of
evil
is
the
necessary
incident
of
the
existence
of
a
principle
of
good
as
a
shadow
is
the
necessary
incident
of
the
presence
of
light
in
this
manner
could
be
explained
the
occurrence
of
evil
in
a
world
the
maker
and
ruler
of
which
is
supremely
good
each
of
the
personified
principles
of
light
and
darkness
ormuzd
and
ahriman
had
his
subordinate
angels
his
counselors
his
armies
it
is
the
duty
of
a
good
man
to
cultivate
truth
purity
and
industry
he
may
look
forward
when
this
life
is
over
to
a
life
in
another
world
and
trust
to
a
resurrection
of
the
body
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
a
conscious
future
existence
in
the
later
years
of
the
empire
the
principles
of
magianism
had
gradually
prevailed
more
and
more
over
those
of
zoroaster
magianism
was
essentially
a
worship
of
the
elements
of
these
fire
was
considered
as
the
most
worthy
representative
of
the
supreme
being
on
altars
erected
not
in
temples
but
under
the
blue
canopy
of
the
sky
perpetual
fires
were
kept
burning
and
the
rising
sun
was
regarded
as
the
noblest
object
of
human
adoration
in
the
society
of
asia
nothing
is
visible
but
the
monarch
in
the
expanse
of
heaven
all
objects
vanish
in
presence
of
the
sun
death
of
alexander
prematurely
cut
off
in
the
midst
of
many
great
projects
alexander
died
at
babylon
before
he
had
completed
his
year
there
was
a
suspicion
that
he
had
been
poisoned
his
temper
had
become
so
unbridled
his
passion
so
ferocious
that
his
generals
and
even
his
intimate
friends
lived
in
continual
dread
clitus
one
of
the
latter
he
in
a
moment
of
fury
had
stabbed
to
the
heart
callisthenes
the
intermedium
between
himself
and
aristotle
he
had
caused
to
be
hanged
or
as
was
positively
asserted
by
some
who
knew
the
facts
had
had
him
put
upon
the
rack
and
then
crucified
it
may
have
been
in
that
the
conspirators
resolved
on
his
assassination
but
surely
it
was
a
calumny
to
associate
the
name
of
aristotle
with
this
transaction
he
would
have
rather
borne
the
worst
that
alexander
could
inflict
than
have
joined
in
the
perpetration
of
so
great
a
crime
a
scene
of
confusion
and
bloodshed
lasting
many
years
ensued
nor
did
it
cease
even
after
the
macedonian
generals
had
divided
the
empire
among
its
vicissitudes
one
incident
mainly
claims
our
attention
ptolemy
who
was
a
son
of
king
philip
by
arsinoe
a
beautiful
concubine
and
who
in
his
boyhood
had
been
driven
into
exile
with
alexander
when
they
incurred
their
father
displeasure
who
had
been
alexander
comrade
in
many
of
his
battles
and
all
his
campaigns
became
governor
and
eventually
king
of
egypt
foundation
of
alexander
at
the
siege
of
rhodes
ptolemy
had
been
of
such
signal
service
to
its
citizens
that
in
gratitude
they
paid
divine
honors
to
him
and
saluted
him
with
the
title
of
soter
the
savior
by
that
designation
ptolemy
soter
he
is
distinguished
from
succeeding
kings
of
the
macedonian
dynasty
in
egypt
he
established
his
seat
of
government
not
in
any
of
the
old
capitals
of
the
country
but
in
alexandria
at
the
time
of
the
expedition
to
the
temple
of
jupiter
ammon
the
macedonian
conqueror
had
caused
the
foundations
of
that
city
to
be
laid
foreseeing
that
it
might
be
made
the
commercial
entrepot
between
asia
and
europe
it
is
to
be
particularly
remarked
that
not
only
did
alexander
himself
deport
many
jews
from
palestine
to
people
the
city
and
not
only
did
ptolemy
soter
bring
one
hundred
thousand
more
after
his
siege
of
jerusalem
but
philadelphus
his
successor
redeemed
from
slavery
one
hundred
and
thousand
of
that
people
paying
their
egyptian
owners
a
just
money
equivalent
for
each
to
all
these
jews
the
same
privileges
were
accorded
as
to
the
macedonians
in
consequence
of
this
considerate
treatment
vast
numbers
of
their
compatriots
and
many
syrians
voluntarily
came
into
egypt
to
them
the
designation
of
hellenistical
jews
was
given
in
like
manner
tempted
by
the
benign
government
of
soter
multitudes
of
greeks
sought
refuge
in
the
country
and
the
invasions
of
perdiccas
and
antigonus
showed
that
greek
soldiers
would
desert
from
other
macedonian
generals
to
join
is
armies
the
population
of
alexandria
was
therefore
of
three
distinct
nationalities
native
egyptians
greeks
jews
a
fact
that
has
left
an
impress
on
the
religious
faith
of
modern
europe
greek
architects
and
greek
engineers
had
made
alexandria
the
most
beautiful
city
of
the
ancient
world
they
had
filled
it
with
magnificent
palaces
temples
theatres
in
its
centre
at
the
intersection
of
its
two
grand
avenues
which
crossed
each
other
at
right
angles
and
in
the
midst
of
gardens
fountains
obelisks
stood
the
mausoleum
in
which
embalmed
after
the
manner
of
the
egyptians
rested
the
body
of
alexander
in
a
funereal
journey
of
two
years
it
had
been
brought
with
great
pomp
from
babylon
at
first
the
coffin
was
of
pure
gold
but
this
having
led
to
a
violation
of
the
tomb
it
was
replaced
by
one
of
alabaster
but
not
these
not
even
the
great
pharos
built
of
blocks
of
white
marble
and
so
high
that
the
fire
continually
burning
on
its
top
could
be
seen
many
miles
off
at
sea
the
pharos
counted
as
one
of
the
seven
wonders
of
the
world
it
is
not
these
magnificent
achievements
of
architecture
that
arrest
our
attention
the
true
the
most
glorious
monument
of
the
macedonian
kings
of
egypt
is
the
museum
its
influences
will
last
when
even
the
pyramids
have
passed
away
the
alexandrian
museum
the
alexandrian
museum
was
commenced
by
ptolemy
soter
and
was
completed
by
his
son
ptolemy
philadelphus
it
was
situated
in
the
bruchion
the
aristocratic
quarter
of
the
city
adjoining
the
king
palace
built
of
marble
it
was
surrounded
with
a
piazza
in
which
the
residents
might
walk
and
converse
together
its
sculptured
apartments
contained
the
philadelphian
library
and
were
crowded
with
the
choicest
statues
and
pictures
this
library
eventually
comprised
four
hundred
thousand
volumes
in
the
course
of
time
probably
on
account
of
inadequate
accommodation
for
so
many
books
an
additional
library
was
established
in
the
adjacent
quarter
rhacotis
and
placed
in
the
serapion
or
temple
of
serapis
the
number
of
volumes
in
this
library
which
was
called
the
daughter
of
that
in
the
museum
was
eventually
three
hundred
thousand
there
were
therefore
seven
hundred
thousand
volumes
in
these
royal
collections
alexandria
was
not
merely
the
capital
of
egypt
it
was
the
intellectual
metropolis
of
the
world
here
it
was
truly
said
the
genius
of
the
east
met
the
genius
of
the
west
and
this
paris
of
antiquity
became
a
focus
of
fashionable
dissipation
and
universal
skepticism
in
the
allurements
of
its
bewitching
society
even
the
jews
forgot
their
patriotism
they
abandoned
the
language
of
their
forefathers
and
adopted
greek
in
the
establishment
of
the
museum
ptolemy
soter
and
his
son
philadelphus
had
three
objects
in
view
the
perpetuation
of
such
knowledge
as
was
then
in
the
world
its
increase
its
diffusion
for
the
perpetuation
of
knowledge
orders
were
given
to
the
chief
librarian
to
buy
at
the
king
expense
whatever
books
he
could
a
body
of
transcribers
was
maintained
in
the
museum
whose
duty
it
was
to
make
correct
copies
of
such
works
as
their
owners
were
not
disposed
to
sell
any
books
brought
by
foreigners
into
egypt
were
taken
at
once
to
the
museum
and
when
correct
copies
had
been
made
the
transcript
was
given
to
the
owner
and
the
original
placed
in
the
library
often
a
very
large
pecuniary
indemnity
was
paid
thus
it
is
said
of
ptolemy
euergetes
that
having
obtained
from
athens
the
works
of
euripides
sophocles
and
aeschylus
he
sent
to
their
owners
transcripts
together
with
about
fifteen
thousand
dollars
as
an
indemnity
on
his
return
from
the
syrian
expedition
he
carried
back
in
triumph
all
the
egyptian
monuments
from
ecbatana
and
susa
which
cambyses
and
other
invaders
had
removed
from
egypt
these
he
replaced
in
their
original
seats
or
added
as
adornments
to
his
museums
when
works
were
translated
as
well
as
transcribed
sums
which
we
should
consider
as
almost
incredible
were
paid
as
was
the
case
with
the
septuagint
translation
of
the
bible
ordered
by
ptolemy
philadelphus
for
the
increase
of
knowledge
one
of
the
chief
objects
of
the
museum
was
that
of
serving
as
the
home
of
a
body
of
men
who
devoted
themselves
to
study
and
were
lodged
and
maintained
at
the
king
expense
occasionally
he
himself
sat
at
their
table
anecdotes
connected
with
those
festive
occasions
have
descended
to
our
times
in
the
original
organization
of
the
museum
the
residents
were
divided
into
four
faculties
literature
mathematics
astronomy
medicine
minor
branches
were
appropriately
classified
under
one
of
these
general
heads
thus
natural
history
was
considered
to
be
a
branch
of
medicine
an
officer
of
very
great
distinction
presided
over
the
establishment
and
had
general
charge
of
its
interests
demetrius
phalareus
perhaps
the
most
learned
man
of
his
age
who
had
been
governor
of
athens
for
many
years
was
the
first
so
appointed
under
him
was
the
librarian

office
sometimes
held
by
men
whose
names
have
descended
to
our
times
as
eratosthenes
and
apollonius
rhodius
organization
of
the
museum
in
connection
with
the
museum
were
a
botanical
and
a
zoological
garden
these
gardens
as
their
names
import
were
for
the
purpose
of
facilitating
the
study
of
plants
and
animals
there
was
also
an
astronomical
observatory
containing
armillary
spheres
globes
solstitial
and
equatorial
armils
astrolabes
parallactic
rules
and
other
apparatus
then
in
use
the
graduation
on
the
divided
instruments
being
into
degrees
and
sixths
on
the
floor
of
this
observatory
a
meridian
line
was
drawn
the
want
of
correct
means
of
measuring
time
and
temperature
was
severely
felt
the
clepsydra
of
ctesibius

very
imperfectly
for
the
former

variations
of

philadelphus
who
toward
the
close
of
his
life
was
haunted
with
an
intolerable
dread
of
death
devoted
much
of
his
time
to
the
discovery
of
an
elixir
for
such
pursuits
the
museum
was
provided
with
a
chemical
laboratory
in
spite
of
the
prejudices
of
the
age
and
especially
in
spite
of
egyptian
prejudices
there
was
in
connection
with
the
medical
department
an
anatomical
room
for
the
dissection
not
only
of
the
dead
but
actually
of
the
living
who
for
crimes
had
been
condemned
for
the
diffusion
of
knowledge
in
the
museum
was
given
by
lectures
conversation
or
other
appropriate
methods
instruction
in
all
the
various
departments
of
human
knowledge
there
flocked
to
this
great
intellectual
centre
students
from
all
countries
it
is
said
that
at
one
time
not
fewer
than
fourteen
thousand
were
in
attendance
subsequently
even
the
christian
church
received
from
it
some
of
the
most
eminent
of
its
fathers
as
clemens
alexandrinus
origen
athanasius
the
library
in
the
museum
was
burnt
during
the
siege
of
alexandria
by
julius
caesar
to
make
amends
for
this
great
loss
that
collected
by
eumenes
king
of
pergamus
was
presented
by
mark
antony
to
queen
cleopatra
originally
it
was
founded
as
a
rival
to
that
of
the
ptolemies
it
was
added
to
the
collection
in
the
serapion
scientific
school
of
the
museum
it
remains
now
to
describe
briefly
the
philosophical
basis
of
the
museum
and
some
of
its
contributions
to
the
stock
of
human
knowledge
in
memory
of
the
illustrious
founder
of
this
most
noble
institution
an
institution
which
antiquity
delighted
to
call
the
divine
school
of
alexandria
we
must
mention
in
the
first
rank
his
history
of
the
campaigns
of
alexander
great
as
a
soldier
and
as
a
sovereign
ptolemy
soter
added
to
his
glory
by
being
an
author
time
which
has
not
been
able
to
destroy
the
memory
of
our
obligations
to
him
has
dealt
unjustly
by
his
work
it
is
not
now
extant
as
might
be
expected
from
the
friendship
that
existed
between
alexander
ptolemy
and
aristotle
the
aristotelian
philosophy
was
the
intellectual
on
which
the
museum
rested
king
philip
had
committed
the
education
of
alexander
to
aristotle
and
during
the
persian
campaigns
the
conqueror
contributed
materially
not
only
in
money
but
otherwise
toward
the
natural
history
then
in
preparation
the
essential
principle
of
the
aristotelian
philosophy
was
to
rise
from
the
study
of
particulars
to
a
knowledge
of
general
principles
or
universals
advancing
to
them
by
induction
the
induction
is
the
more
certain
as
the
facts
on
which
it
is
based
are
more
numerous
its
correctness
is
established
if
it
should
enable
us
to
predict
other
facts
until
then
unknown
this
system
implies
endless
toil
in
the
collection
of
facts
both
by
experiment
and
observation
it
implies
also
a
close
meditation
on
them
it
is
therefore
essentially
a
method
of
labor
and
of
reason
not
a
method
of
imagination
the
failures
that
aristotle
himself
so
often
exhibits
are
no
proof
of
its
unreliability
but
rather
of
its
trustworthiness
they
are
failures
arising
from
want
of
a
sufficiency
of
facts
ethical
school
of
the
museum
some
of
the
general
results
at
which
aristotle
arrived
are
very
grand
thus
he
concluded
that
every
thing
is
ready
to
burst
into
life
and
that
the
various
organic
forms
presented
to
us
by
nature
are
those
which
existing
conditions
permit
should
the
conditions
change
the
forms
will
also
change
hence
there
is
an
unbroken
chain
from
the
simple
element
through
plants
and
animals
up
to
man
the
different
groups
merging
by
insensible
shades
into
each
other
the
inductive
philosophy
thus
established
by
aristotle
is
a
method
of
great
power
to
it
all
the
modern
advances
in
science
are
due
in
its
most
improved
form
it
rises
by
inductions
from
phenomena
to
their
causes
and
then
imitating
the
method
of
the
academy
it
descends
by
deductions
from
those
causes
to
the
detail
of
phenomena
while
thus
the
scientific
school
of
alexandria
was
founded
on
the
maxims
of
one
great
athenian
philosopher
the
ethical
school
was
founded
on
the
maxims
of
another
for
zeno
though
a
cypriote
or
phoenician
had
for
many
years
been
established
at
athens
his
disciples
took
the
name
of
stoics
his
doctrines
long
survived
him
and
in
times
when
there
was
no
other
consolation
for
man
offered
a
support
in
the
hour
of
trial
and
an
unwavering
guide
in
the
vicissitudes
of
life
not
only
to
illustrious
greeks
but
also
to
many
of
the
great
philosophers
statesmen
generals
and
emperors
of
rome
the
principles
of
stoicism
the
aim
of
zeno
was
to
furnish
a
guide
for
the
daily
practice
of
life
to
make
men
virtuous
he
insisted
that
education
is
the
true
foundation
of
virtue
for
if
we
know
what
is
good
we
shall
incline
to
do
it
we
must
trust
to
sense
to
furnish
the
data
of
knowledge
and
reason
will
suitably
combine
them
in
this
the
affinity
of
zeno
to
aristotle
is
plainly
seen
every
appetite
lust
desire
springs
from
imperfect
knowledge
our
nature
is
imposed
upon
us
by
fate
but
we
must
learn
to
control
our
passions
and
live
free
intelligent
virtuous
in
all
things
in
accordance
with
reason
our
existence
should
be
intellectual
we
should
survey
with
equanimity
all
pleasures
and
all
pains
we
should
never
forget
that
we
are
freemen
not
the
slaves
of
society
i
possess
said
the
stoic
a
treasure
which
not
all
the
world
can
rob
me
of
no
one
can
deprive
me
of
death
we
should
remember
that
nature
in
her
operations
aims
at
the
universal
and
never
spares
individuals
but
uses
them
as
means
for
the
accomplishment
of
her
ends
it
is
therefore
for
us
to
submit
to
destiny
cultivating
as
the
things
necessary
to
virtue
knowledge
temperance
fortitude
justice
we
must
remember
that
every
thing
around
us
is
in
mutation
decay
follows
reproduction
and
reproduction
decay
and
that
it
is
useless
to
repine
at
death
in
a
world
where
every
thing
is
dying
as
a
cataract
shows
from
year
to
year
an
invariable
shape
though
the
water
composing
it
is
perpetually
changing
so
the
aspect
of
nature
is
nothing
more
than
a
flow
of
matter
presenting
an
impermanent
form
the
universe
considered
as
a
whole
is
unchangeable
nothing
is
eternal
but
space
atoms
force
the
forms
of
nature
that
we
see
are
essentially
transitory
they
must
all
pass
away
stoicism
in
the
museum
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
the
majority
of
men
are
imperfectly
educated
and
hence
we
must
not
needlessly
offend
the
religious
ideas
of
our
age
it
is
enough
for
us
ourselves
to
know
that
though
there
is
a
supreme
power
there
is
no
supreme
being
there
is
an
invisible
principle
but
not
a
personal
god
to
whom
it
would
be
not
so
much
blasphemy
as
absurdity
to
impute
the
form
the
sentiments
the
passions
of
man
all
revelation
is
necessarily
a
mere
fiction
that
which
men
call
chance
is
only
the
effect
of
an
unknown
cause
even
of
chances
there
is
a
law
there
is
no
such
thing
as
providence
for
nature
proceeds
under
irresistible
laws
and
in
this
respect
the
universe
is
only
a
vast
automatic
engine
the
vital
force
which
pervades
the
world
is
what
the
illiterate
call
god
the
modifications
through
which
all
things
are
running
take
place
in
an
irresistible
way
and
hence
it
may
be
said
that
the
progress
of
the
world
is
under
destiny
like
a
seed
it
can
evolve
only
in
a
predetermined
mode
the
soul
of
man
is
a
spark
of
the
vital
flame
the
general
vital
principle
like
heat
it
passes
from
one
to
another
and
is
finally
reabsorbed
or
reunited
in
the
universal
principle
from
which
it
came
hence
we
must
not
expect
annihilation
but
reunion
and
as
the
tired
man
looks
forward
to
the
insensibility
of
sleep
so
the
philosopher
weary
of
the
world
should
look
forward
to
the
tranquillity
of
extinction
of
these
things
however
we
should
think
doubtingly
since
the
mind
can
produce
no
certain
knowledge
from
its
internal
resources
alone
it
is
unphilosophical
to
inquire
into
first
causes
we
must
deal
only
with
phenomena
above
all
we
must
never
forget
that
man
can
not
ascertain
absolute
truth
and
that
the
final
result
of
human
inquiry
into
the
matter
is
that
we
are
incapable
of
perfect
knowledge
that
even
if
the
truth
be
in
our
possession
we
can
not
be
sure
of
it
what
then
remains
for
us
is
it
not
this
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
the
cultivation
of
virtue
and
of
friendship
the
observance
of
faith
and
truth
an
unrepining
submission
to
whatever
befalls
us
a
life
led
in
accordance
with
reason
platonism
in
the
museum
but
though
the
alexandrian
museum
was
especially
intended
for
the
cultivation
of
the
aristotelian
philosophy
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
other
systems
were
excluded
platonism
was
not
only
carried
to
its
full
development
but
in
the
end
it
supplanted
peripateticism
and
through
the
new
academy
left
a
permanent
impress
on
christianity
the
philosophical
method
of
plato
was
the
inverse
of
that
of
aristotle
its
was
universals
the
very
existence
of
which
was
a
matter
of
faith
and
from
these
it
descended
to
particulars
or
details
aristotle
on
the
contrary
rose
from
particulars
to
universals
advancing
to
them
by
inductions
plato
therefore
trusted
to
the
imagination
aristotle
to
reason
the
former
descended
from
the
decomposition
of
a
primitive
idea
into
particulars
the
latter
united
particulars
into
a
general
conception
hence
the
method
of
plato
was
capable
of
quickly
producing
what
seemed
to
be
splendid
though
in
reality
unsubstantial
results
that
of
aristotle
was
more
tardy
in
its
operation
but
much
more
solid
it
implied
endless
labor
in
the
collection
of
facts
a
tedious
resort
to
experiment
and
observation
the
application
of
demonstration
the
philosophy
of
plato
is
a
gorgeous
castle
in
the
air
that
of
aristotle
a
solid
structure
laboriously
and
with
many
failures
founded
on
the
solid
rock
an
appeal
to
the
imagination
is
much
more
alluring
than
the
employment
of
reason
in
the
intellectual
decline
of
alexandria
indolent
methods
were
preferred
to
laborious
observation
and
severe
mental
exercise
the
schools
of
were
crowded
with
speculative
mystics
such
as
ammonius
saccas
and
plotinus
these
took
the
place
of
the
severe
geometers
of
the
old
museum
physical
science
in
the
museum
the
alexandrian
school
offers
the
first
example
of
that
system
which
in
the
hands
of
modern
physicists
has
led
to
such
wonderful
results
it
rejected
imagination
and
made
its
theories
the
expression
of
facts
obtained
by
experiment
and
observation
aided
by
mathematical
discussion
it
enforced
the
principle
that
the
true
method
of
studying
nature
is
by
experimental
interrogation
the
researches
of
archimedes
in
specific
gravity
and
the
works
of
ptolemy
on
optics
resemble
our
present
investigations
in
experimental
philosophy
and
stand
in
striking
contrast
with
the
speculative
vagaries
of
the
older
writers
laplace
says
that
the
only
observation
which
the
history
of
astronomy
offers
us
made
by
the
greeks
before
the
school
of
alexandria
is
that
of
the
summer
solstice
of
the
year
by
meton
and
euctemon
we
have
for
the
first
time
in
that
school
a
combined
system
of
observations
made
with
instruments
for
the
measurement
of
angles
and
calculated
by
trigonometrical
methods
astronomy
then
took
a
form
which
subsequent
ages
could
only
perfect
it
does
not
accord
with
the
compass
or
the
intention
of
this
work
to
give
a
detailed
account
of
the
contributions
of
the
alexandrian
museum
to
the
stock
of
human
knowledge
it
is
sufficient
that
the
reader
should
obtain
a
general
impression
of
their
character
for
particulars
i
may
refer
him
to
the
sixth
chapter
of
my
history
of
the
intellectual
development
of
europe
euclid
archimedes
it
has
just
been
remarked
that
the
stoical
philosophy
doubted
whether
the
mind
can
ascertain
absolute
truth
while
zeno
was
indulging
in
such
doubts
euclid
was
preparing
his
great
work
destined
to
challenge
contradiction
from
the
whole
human
race
after
more
than
centuries
it
still
survives
a
model
of
accuracy
perspicuity
and
a
standard
of
exact
demonstration
this
great
geometer
not
only
wrote
on

archimedes
though
he
eventually
resided
in
sicily
among
his
mathematical
works
were
two
books
on
the
sphere

cylinder
in
which
he
gave
the
demonstration
that
the
solid
content
of
a
sphere
is
that
of
its
circumscribing
cylinder
so
highly
did
he
esteem
this
that
he
directed
the

engraved

he
also
treated
of

eratosthenes
who
at

had
charge

was
the

among

may
be
mentioned
his
determination
of

an

that
the

appreciated
for
many

they
were
thrown
into
discredit
by
the
authority
of
our

absurd

it
is
unnecessary
to
adduce
the
arguments
relied
upon
by
the
alexandrians
to
prove
the

they

can
not
do

than
merely
allude
to

is
said
to
have
been
the

it
was
to
those
of

on

that
hipparchus
was
indebted
for
his
great
discovery
of
the
precession
of
the
eqninoxes
hipparchus
also
determined
the
first
inequality
of
the
moon
the
equation
of
the
centre
he
adopted
the
theory
of
epicycles
and
eccentrics
a
geometrical
conception
for
the
purpose
of
resolving
the
apparent
motions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
on
the
principle
of
circular
movement
he
also
undertook
to
make
a
catalogue
of
the
stars
by
the
method
of
alineations
that
is
by
indicating
those
that
are
in
the
same
apparent
straight
line
the
number
of
stars
so
catalogued
was
if
he
thus
attempted
to
depict
the
aspect
of
the
sky
he
endeavored
to
do
the
same
for
the
surface
of
the
earth
by
marking
the
position
of
towns
and
other
places
by
lines
of
latitude
and

he
was
the
first
to
construct
tables

how
ephemeral

the

that

it

astronomical
observations
had
been
made
in

the

also
had
been
cultivated
with

of

in

was

resorted
to
the
characteristic
feature
of
alexandrian
as
of

is
that
it

not
restrict
itself
to
observation

relied

from

imperial
form
of
government
all
the
independent
nationalities
around
the

central
power
the

that
had

had

no

were

not

the
conquest
she
had
made
but
also
as
a
gratification
to
her
pride
the
conquering
republic
brought
the

of
the
vanquished

to

with
disdainful
toleration
she
permitted
the
worship
of

all
that
paramount
authority
exercised
by

in

disappeared
at

in
the

among
whom
he
had
been
brought
already
as
we
have
seen
through
geographical
discoveries
and
philosophical
criticism
faith
in
the
religion
of
the
old
days
had
been
profoundly
shaken
it
was
by
this
policy
of

brought
to
an

monotheism
in
the
roman
empire
the
kings
of
all
the
conquered
provinces
had
vanished
in
their
stead
one
emperor
had
come
the
gods
also
had
disappeared
considering
the
connection
which
in
all
ages
has
existed
between
political
and
religious
ideas
it
was
then
not
at
all
strange
that
polytheism
should
manifest
a
tendency
to
pass
into
monotheism
accordingly
divine
honors
were
paid
at
first
to
the
deceased
and
at
length
to
the
living
emperor
the
facility
with
which
gods
were
thus
called
into
existence
had
a
powerful
moral
effect
the
manufacture
of
a
new
one
cast
ridicule
on
the
origin
of
the
old
incarnation
in
the

and

in

made

in

in
the
west
men

it
was
not
the
importation
of
greek
skepticism
that
made

skeptical
the
excesses
of
religion
itself
sapped
the
foundations
of

not
with
equal
rapidity
did
all

of
the

the

by

in

had
reached
its
culmination
in
a
religious
and
social
aspect
it
had
attained
its
height
of
immorality
it
had
become
thoroughly
epicurean
its
maxim
was
that
life
should
be
made
a
feast
that
virtue
is
only
the
seasoning
of
pleasure
and
temperance
the
means
of
prolonging

all
the

magnificent

gladiators
such
were
the
objects
of
roman
desire
the
conquerors
of
the
world
had
discovered
that
the
only
thing
worth
worshiping
is
force
by
it
all
things
might
be
secured
all
that
toil
and
trade
had
laboriously
obtained
the
confiscation
of

the
taxation
of

were
the
reward
of
successful
warfare
and
the
emperor
was
the
symbol
of
force
there
was
a
social
splendor
but
it
was
the
phosphorescent
corruption
of
the
ancient
mediterranean
world
in
one
of
the
eastern
provinces
syria
some
persons
in
very
humble
life
had
associated
themselves
together
for
benevolent
and
religious
purposes
the
doctrines
they
held
were
in
harmony
with
that
sentiment
of
universal
brotherhood
arising
from
the
coalescence
of
the
conquered
kingdoms
they
were
doctrines
inculcated
by
jesus
the
jewish
people
at
that
time
entertained
a
belief
founded
on
old
traditions
that
a
deliverer
would
arise
among
them
who
would
restore
them
to
their
ancient
splendor
the
disciples
of
jesus
regarded
him
as
this
messiah
but
the
priesthood
believing
that
the
doctrines
he
taught
were
prejudicial
to
their
interests
denounced
him
to
the
roman
governor
who
to
satisfy
their
clamors
reluctantly
delivered
him
over
to
death
his
doctrines
of
benevolence
and
human
brotherhood
outlasted
that
event
the
disciples
instead
of
scattering
organized
they
associated
themselves
on
a
principle
of
communism
each
throwing
into
the
common
stock
whatever
property
he
possessed
and
all
his
gains
the
widows
and
orphans
of
the
community
were
thus
supported
the
poor
and
the
sick
sustained
from
this
germ
was
developed
a
new
and
as
the
events
proved
society
the
church
new
for
nothing
of
the
kind
had
existed
in
antiquity
powerful
for
the
local
churches
at
first
isolated
soon
began
to
confederate
for
their
common
interest
through
this
organization
christianity
achieved
all
her
political
triumphs
as
we
have
said
the
military
domination
of
rome
had
brought
about
universal
peace
and
had
generated
a
sentiment
of
brotherhood
among
the
vanquished
nations
things
were
therefore
propitious
for
the
rapid
diffusion
of
the
the
christian
principle
throughout
the
empire
it
spread
from
syria
through
all
asia
minor
and
successively
reached
cyprus
greece
italy
eventually
extending
westward
as
far
as
gaul
and
britain
its
propagation
was
hastened
by
missionaries
who
made
it
known
in
all
directions
none
of
the
ancient
classical
philosophies
had
ever
taken
advantage
of
such
a
means
political
conditions
determined
the
boundaries
of
the
new
religion
its
limits
were
eventually
those
of
the
roman
empire
rome
doubtfully
the
place
of
death
of
peter
not
jerusalem
indisputably
the
place
of
the
death
of
our
savior
became
the
religious
capital
it
was
better
to
have
possession
of
the
imperial
seven
hilled
city
than
of
gethsemane
and
calvary
with
all
their
holy
souvenirs
it
gathers
political
power
for
many
years
christianity
manifested
itself
as
a
system
enjoining
three
things
toward
god
veneration
in
personal
life
purity
in
social
life
benevolence
in
its
early
days
of
feebleness
it
made
proselytes
only
by
persuasion
but
as
it
increased
in
numbers
and
influence
it
began
to
exhibit
political
tendencies
a
disposition
to
form
a
government
within
the
government
an
empire
within
the
empire
these
tendencies
it
has
never
since
lost
they
are
in
truth
the
logical
result
of
its
development
the
roman
emperors
discovering
that
it
was
absolutely
incompatible
with
the
imperial
system
tried
to
put
it
down
by
force
this
was
in
accordance
with
the
spirit
of
their
military
maxims
which
had
no
other
means
but
force
for
the
establishment
of
conformity
in
the
winter
the
christian
soldiers
in
some
of
the
legions
refused
to
join
in
the
solemnities
for
propitiating
the
gods
the
mutiny
spread
so
quickly
the
emergency
became
so
pressing
that
the
emperor
diocletian
was
compelled
to
hold
a
council
for
the
purpose
of
determining
what
should
be
done
the
difficulty
of
the
position
may
perhaps
be
appreciated
when
it
is
understood
that
the
wife
and
the
daughter
of
diocletian
himself
were
christians
he
was
a
man
of
great
capacity
and
large
political
views
he
recognized
in
the
opposition
that
must
be
made
to
the
new
party
a
political
necessity
yet
he
expressly
enjoined
that
there
should
be
no
bloodshed
but
who
can
control
an
infuriated
civil
commotion
the
church
of
nicomedia
was
razed
to
the
ground
in
retaliation
the
imperial
palace
was
set
on
fire
an
edict
was
openly
insulted
and
torn
down
the
christian
officers
in
the
army
were
cashiered
in
all
directions
martyrdoms
and
massacres
were
taking
place
so
resistless
was
the
march
of
events
that
not
even
the
emperor
himself
could
stop
the
persecution
the
first
christian
emperor
it
had
now
become
evident
that
the
christians
constituted
a
powerful
party
in
the
state
animated
with
indignation
at
the
atrocities
they
had
suffered
and
determined
to
endure
them
no
longer
after
the
abdication
of
diocletian
constantine
one
of
the
competitors
for
the
purple
perceiving
the
advantages
that
would
accrue
to
him
from
such
a
policy
put
himself
forth
as
the
head
of
the
christian
party
this
gave
him
in
every
part
of
the
empire
men
and
women
ready
to
encounter
fire
and
sword
in
his
behalf
it
gave
him
unwavering
adherents
in
every
legion
of
the
armies
in
a
decisive
battle
near
the
milvian
bridge
victory
crowned
his
schemes
the
death
of
maximin
and
subsequently
that
of
licinius
removed
all
obstacles
he
ascended
the
throne
of
the
caesars
the
first
christian
emperor
place
profit
power
these
were
in
view
of
whoever
now
joined
the
conquering
sect
crowds
of
worldly
persons
who
cared
nothing
about
its
religious
ideas
became
its
warmest
supporters
pagans
at
heart
their
influence
was
soon
manifested
in
the
paganization
of
christianity
that
forthwith
ensued
the
emperor
no
better
than
they
did
nothing
to
check
their
proceedings
but
he
did
not
personally
conform
to
the
ceremonial
requirements
of
the
church
until
the
close
of
his
evil
life
tertullian
exposition
of
christianity
that
we
may
clearly
appreciate
the
modifications
now
impressed
on
christianity
modifications
which
eventually
brought
it
in
conflict
with
science
we
must
have
as
a
means
of
comparison
a
statement
of
what
it
was
in
its
purer
days
such
fortunately
we
find
in
the
apology
or
defense
of
the
christians
against
the
accusations
of
the
gentiles
written
by
tertullian
at
rome
during
the
persecution
of
severus
he
addressed
it
not
to
the
emperor
but
to
the
magistrates
who
sat
in
judgment
on
the
accused
it
is
a
solemn
and
most
earnest
expostulation
setting
forth
all
that
could
be
said
in
explanation
of
the
subject
a
representation
of
the
belief
and
cause
of
the
christians
made
in
the
imperial
city
in
the
face
of
the
whole
world
not
a
querulous
or
passionate
ecclesiastical
appeal
but
a
grave
historical
document
it
has
ever
been
looked
upon
as
one
of
the
ablest
of
the
early
christian
works
its
date
is
about
with
no
inconsiderable
skill
tertullian
opens
his
argument
he
tells
the
magistrates
that
christianity
is
a
stranger
upon
earth
and
that
she
expects
to
meet
with
enemies
in
a
country
which
is
not
her
own
she
only
asks
that
she
may
not
be
condemned
unheard
and
that
roman
magistrates
will
permit
her
to
defend
herself
that
the
laws
of
the
empire
will
gather
lustre
if
judgment
be
passed
upon
her
after
she
has
been
tried
but
not
if
she
is
sentenced
without
a
hearing
of
her
cause
that
it
is
unjust
to
hate
a
thing
of
which
we
are
ignorant
even
though
it
may
be
a
thing
worthy
of
hate
that
the
laws
of
rome
deal
with
actions
not
with
mere
names
but
that
notwithstanding
this
persons
have
been
punished
because
they
were
called
christians
and
that
without
any
accusation
of
crime
he
then
advances
to
an
exposition
of
the
origin
the
nature
and
the
effects
of
christianity
stating
that
it
is
founded
on
the
hebrew
scriptures
which
are
the
most
venerable
of
all
books
he
says
to
the
magistrates
the
books
of
moses
in
which
god
has
inclosed
as
in
a
treasure
all
the
religion
of
the
jews
and
consequently
all
the
christian
religion
reach
far
beyond
the
oldest
you
have
even
beyond
all
your
public
monuments
the
establishment
of
your
state
the
foundation
of
many
great
cities
all
that
is
most
advanced
by
you
in
all
ages
of
history
and
memory
of
times
the
invention
of
letters
which
are
the
interpreters
of
sciences
and
the
guardians
of
all
excellent
things
i
think
i
may
say
more
beyond
your
gods
your
temples
your
oracles
and
sacrifices
the
author
of
those
books
lived
a
thousand
years
before
the
siege
of
troy
and
more
than
fifteen
hundred
before
homer
time
is
the
ally
of
truth
and
wise
men
believe
nothing
but
what
is
certain
and
what
has
been
verified
by
time
the
principal
authority
of
these
scriptures
is
derived
from
their
venerable
antiquity
the
most
learned
of
the
ptolemies
who
was
surnamed
philadelphus
an
accomplished
prince
by
the
advice
of
demetrius
phalareus
obtained
a
copy
of
these
holy
books
it
may
be
found
at
this
day
in
his
library
the
divinity
of
these
scriptures
is
proved
by
this
that
all
that
is
done
in
our
days
may
be
found
predicted
in
them
they
contain
all
that
has
since
passed
in
the
view
of
men
is
not
the
accomplishment
of
a
prophecy
a
testimony
to
its
truth
seeing
that
events
which
are
past
have
vindicated
these
prophecies
shall
we
be
blamed
for
trusting
them
in
events
that
are
to
come
now
as
we
believe
things
that
have
been
prophesied
and
have
come
to
pass
so
we
believe
things
that
have
been
told
us
but
not
yet
come
to
pass
because
they
have
all
been
foretold
by
the
same
scriptures
as
well
those
that
are
verified
every
day
as
those
that
still
remain
to
be
fulfilled
these
holy
scriptures
teach
us
that
there
is
one
god
who
made
the
world
out
of
nothing
who
though
daily
seen
is
invisible
his
infiniteness
is
known
only
to
himself
his
immensity
conceals
but
at
the
same
time
discovers
him
he
has
ordained
for
men
according
to
their
lives
rewards
and
punishments
he
will
raise
all
the
dead
that
have
ever
lived
from
the
creation
of
the
world
will
command
them
to
reassume
their
bodies
and
thereupon
adjudge
them
to
felicity
that
has
so
end
or
to
eternal
flames
the
fires
of
hell
are
those
hidden
flames
which
the
earth
shuts
up
in
her
bosom
he
has
in
past
times
sent
into
the
world
preachers
or
prophets
the
prophets
of
those
old
times
were
jews
they
addressed
their
oracles
for
such
they
were
to
the
jews
who
have
stored
them
up
in
the
scriptures
on
them
as
has
been
said
christianity
is
founded
though
the
christian
differs
in
his
ceremonies
from
the
jew
we
are
accused
of
worshiping
a
man
and
not
the
god
of
the
jews
not
so
the
honor
we
bear
to
christ
does
not
derogate
from
the
honor
we
bear
to
god
on
account
of
the
merit
of
these
ancient
patriarchs
the
jews
were
the
only
beloved
people
of
god
he
delighted
to
be
in
communication
with
them
by
his
own
mouth
by
him
they
were
raised
to
admirable
greatness
but
with
perversity
they
wickedly
ceased
to
regard
him
they
changed
his
laws
into
a
profane
worship
he
warned
them
that
he
would
take
to
himself
servants
more
faithful
than
they
and
for
their
crime
punished
them
by
driving
them
forth
from
their
country
they
are
now
spread
all
over
the
world
they
wander
in
all
parts
they
can
not
enjoy
the
air
they
breathed
at
their
birth
they
have
neither
man
nor
god
for
their
king
as
he
threatened
them
so
he
has
done
he
has
taken
in
all
nations
and
countries
of
the
earth
people
more
faithful
than
they
through
his
prophets
he
had
declared
that
these
should
have
greater
favors
and
that
a
messiah
should
come
to
publish
a
new
law
among
them
this
messiah
was
jesus
who
is
also
god
for
god
may
be
derived
from
god
as
the
light
of
a
candle
may
be
derived
from
the
light
of
another
candle
god
and
his
son
are
the
god
a
light
is
the
same
light
as
that
from
which
it
was
taken
the
scriptures
make
known
two
comings
of
the
son
of
god
the
first
in
humility
the
second
at
the
day
of
judgment
in
power
the
jews
might
have
known
all
this
from
the
prophets
but
their
sins
have
so
blinded
them
that
they
did
not
recognize
him
at
his
first
coming
and
are
still
vainly
expecting
him
they
believed
that
all
the
miracles
wrought
by
him
were
the
work
of
magic
the
doctors
of
the
law
and
the
chief
priests
were
envious
of
him
they
denounced
him
to
pilate
he
was
crucified
died
was
buried
and
after
three
days
rose
again
for
forty
days
he
remained
among
his
disciples
then
he
was
environed
in
a
cloud
and
rose
up
to
heaven
a
truth
far
more
certain
than
any
human
testimonies
touching
the
ascension
of
romulus
or
of
any
other
roman
prince
mounting
up
to
the
same
place
tertullian
then
describes
the
origin
and
nature
of
devils
who
under
satan
their
prince
produce
diseases
irregularities
of
the
air
plagues
and
the
blighting
of
the
blossoms
of
the
earth
who
seduce
men
to
offer
sacrifices
that
they
may
have
the
blood
of
the
victims
which
is
their
food
they
are
as
nimble
as
the
birds
and
hence
know
every
thing
that
is
passing
upon
earth
they
live
in
the
air
and
hence
can
spy
what
is
going
on
in
heaven
for
this
reason
they
can
impose
on
men
reigned
prophecies
and
deliver
oracles
thus
they
announced
in
rome
that
a
victory
would
be
obtained
over
king
perseus
when
in
truth
they
knew
that
the
battle
was
already
won
they
falsely
cure
diseases
for
taking
possession
of
the
body
of
a
man
they
produce
in
him
a
distemper
and
then
ordaining
some
remedy
to
be
used
they
cease
to
afflict
him
and
men
think
that
a
cure
has
taken
place
though
christians
deny
that
the
emperor
is
a
god
they
nevertheless
pray
for
his
prosperity
because
the
general
dissolution
that
threatens
the
universe
the
conflagration
of
the
world
is
retarded
so
long
as
the
glorious
majesty
of
the
triumphant
roman
empire
shall
last
they
desire
not
to
be
present
at
the
subversion
of
all
nature
they
acknowledge
only
one
republic
but
it
is
the
whole
world
they
constitute
one
body
worship
one
god
and
all
look
forward
to
eternal
happiness
not
only
do
they
pray
for
the
emperor
and
the
magistrates
but
also
for
peace
they
read
the
scriptures
to
nourish
their
faith
lift
up
their
hope
and
strengthen
the
confidence
they
have
in
god
they
assemble
to
exhort
one
another
they
remove
sinners
from
their
societies
they
have
bishops
who
preside
over
them
approved
by
the
suffrages
of
those
whom
they
are
to
conduct
at
the
end
of
each
month
every
one
contributes
if
he
will
but
no
one
is
constrained
to
give
the
money
gathered
in
this
manner
is
the
pledge
of
piety
it
is
not
consumed
in
eating
and
drinking
but
in
feeding
the
poor
and
burying
them
in
comforting
children
that
are
destitute
of
parents
and
goods
in
helping
old
men
who
have
spent
the
best
of
their
days
in
the
service
of
the
faithful
in
assisting
those
who
have
lost
by
shipwreck
what
they
had
and
those
who
are
condemned
to
the
mines
or
have
been
banished
to
islands
or
shut
up
in
prisons
because
they
professed
the
religion
of
the
true
god
there
is
but
one
thing
that
christians
have
not
in
common
and
that
one
thing
is
their
wives
they
do
not
feast
as
if
they
should
die
nor
build
as
if
they
should
never
die
the
objects
of
their
life
are
innocence
justice
patience
temperance
chastity
to
this
noble
exposition
of
christian
belief
and
life
in
his
day
tertullian
does
not
hesitate
to
add
an
ominous
warning
to
the
magistrates
he
is
addressing
ominous
for
it
was
a
forecast
of
a
great
event
soon
to
come
to
pass
our
origin
is
but
recent
yet
already
we
fill
all
that
your
power
acknowledges
cities
fortresses
islands
provinces
the
assemblies
of
the
people
the
wards
of
rome
the
palace
the
senate
the
public
places
and
especially
the
armies
we
have
left
you
nothing
but
your
temples
reflect
what
wars
we
are
able
to
undertake
with
what
promptitude
might
we
not
arm
ourselves
were
we
not
restrained
by
our
religion
which
teaches
us
that
it
is
better
to
be
killed
than
to
kill
before
he
closes
his
defense
tertullian
renews
an
assertion
which
carried
into
practice
as
it
subsequently
was
affected
the
intellectual
development
of
all
europe
he
declares
that
the
holy
scriptures
are
a
treasure
from
which
all
the
true
wisdom
in
the
world
has
been
drawn
that
every
philosopher
and
every
poet
is
indebted
to
them
he
labors
to
show
that
they
are
the
standard
and
measure
of
all
truth
and
that
whatever
is
inconsistent
with
them
must
necessarily
be
false
from
tertullian
able
work
we
see
what
christianity
was
while
it
was
suffering
persecution
and
struggling
for
existence
we
have
now
to
see
what
it
became
when
in
possession
of
imperial
power
great
is
the
difference
between
christianity
under
severus
and
christianity
after
constantine
many
of
the
doctrines
which
at
the
latter
period
were
preeminent
in
the
former
were
unknown
paganization
of
christianity
two
causes
led
to
the
amalgamation
of
christianity
with
paganism
the
political
necessities
of
the
new
dynasty
the
policy
adopted
by
the
new
religion
to
insure
its
spread
though
the
christian
party
had
proved
itself
sufficiently
strong
to
give
a
master
to
the
empire
it
was
never
sufficiently
strong
to
destroy
its
antagonist
paganism
the
issue
of
the
struggle
between
them
was
an
amalgamation
of
the
principles
of
both
in
this
christianity
differed
from
mohammedanism
which
absolutely
annihilated
its
antagonist
and
spread
its
own
doctrines
without
adulteration
constantine
continually
showed
by
his
acts
that
he
felt
he
must
be
the
impartial
sovereign
of
all
his

if
he
built

churches
he
also
restored
pagan
temples
if
he
listened
to
the

he
also
consulted

on
the

of
the

porphyry
pillar
at
constantinople
consisted
of
an
ancient

were

so

to
form
a
crown
of

feeling
that
there
must
be
concessions
to
the
defeated

party

with
its
ideas
he
looked
with
favor
on
the
idolatrous

in

the

of
these

a
mere
worldling
a
man
without
any
religious

doubtless
it
appeared
best
for
himself
best
for
the
empire
and
best
for
the
contending
parties
christian
and
pagan
to
promote
their
union
or
amalgamation
as
much
as
possible
even
sincere
christians
do
not
seem
to
have
been
averse
to
this
perhaps
they
believed
that
the
new
doctrines
would
diffuse
most
thoroughly
by
incorporating
in
themselves
ideas
borrowed
from
the
old
that
truth
would
assert
her
self
in
the
end
and
the
impurity
be
cast
off
in
accomplishing
this
amalgamation

and
those
of

the

that
had
been
used
they
were
identified
by
miracle
a
true
set
in
the
superstition
of
the
old
greek
times
reappeared
the
times
when
the
tools
with
which
the
trojan
horse
was
made
might
still
be
seen
at
metapontum
the
sceptre
of

at

the

the

of
memnon
at

when
the

could
show
the
hide
of
the
calydonian
boar
and
very
many
cities
boasted
their
possession
of
the
true
palladium
of
troy
when
there
were
statues
of
minerva
that
could
brandish

paintings
that
could

that

by

transmuted
into
one
more
fashionable
and
more
debased
it
was
incorporated
with
the
old
greek
mythology
olympus
was
restored
but
the
divinities
passed
under
other
names
the
more
powerful
provinces
insisted
on
the
adoption
of
their
conceptions
views
of
the
trinity
in
accordance
with
egyptian
traditions
were
established
not
only
was
the
adoration
of
isis
under
a
new
name
restored
but
even
her
image
standing
on
the
crescent
moon
reappeared
the
effigy
of
that
goddess
with
the
infant
horus
in
her
arms
has
descended
to
our
days
in
the
beautiful
artistic
creations
of
the
madonna
and
child
such
restorations
of
old
conceptions
under
novel
forms
were
everywhere
received
with
delight
when
it
was
announced
to
the
ephesians
that
the
council
of
that
place
headed
by
cyril
had
decreed
that
the
virgin
should
be
called
the
mother
of
god
with
tears
of
joy
they
embraced
the
knees
of
their
bishop
it
was
the
old
instinct
peeping
out
their
ancestors
would
have
done
the
same
for
diana
this
attempt
to
conciliate
worldly
converts
by
adopting
their
ideas
and
practices
did
not
pass
without
remonstrance
from
those
whose
intelligence
discerned
the
motive
you
have
says
faustus
to
augustine
substituted
your
agapae
for
the
sacrifices
of
the
pagans
for
their
idols
your
martyrs
whom
you
serve
with
the
very
same
honors
you
appease
the
shades
of
the
dead
with
wine
and
feasts
you
celebrate
the
solemn
festivities
of
the
gentiles
their
calends
and
their
solstices
and
as
to
their
manners
those
you
have
retained
without
any
alteration
nothing
distinguishes
you
from
the
pagans
except
that
you
hold
your
assemblies
apart
from
them
pagan
observances
were
everywhere
introduced
at

introduction
of

rites
let
us
pause
here
a
moment
and
see
in
anticipation
to
what
a
depth
of
intellectual
degradation
this
policy
of
paganization
eventually
led
heathen
rites
were
adopted
a
pompous
and
splendid
ritual
gorgeous
robes
mitres
tiaras
processional
services
lustrations
gold
and
silver
vases
were
introduced
the
roman
lituus
the
chief
ensign
of
the
augurs
became
the
crozier
churches
were
built
over
the
tombs
of
martyrs
and
consecrated
with
rites
borrowed
from
the
ancient
laws
of
the
roman
pontiffs
festivals
and
commemorations
of
martyrs
multiplied
with
the
numberless
fictitious
discoveries
of
their
remains
fasting
became
the
grand
means
of
repelling
the
devil
and
appeasing
god
celibacy
the
greatest
of
the
virtues
pilgrimages
were
made
to
palestine
and
the
tombs
of
the
martyrs
quantities
of
dust
and
earth
were
brought
from
the
holy
land
and
sold
at
enormous
prices
as
antidotes
against
devils
the
virtues
of
consecrated
water
were
upheld
images
and
relics
were
introduced
into
the
churches
and
worshiped
after
the
fashion
of
the
heathen
gods
it
was
given
out
that
prodigies
and
miracles
were
to
be
seen
in
certain
places
as
in
the
heathen
times
the
happy
souls
of
departed
christians
were
invoked
it
was
believed
that
they
were
wandering
about
the
world
or
haunting
their
graves
there
was
a
multiplication
of
temples
altars
and
penitential
garments
the
festival
of
the
purification
of
the
virgin
was
invented
to
remove
the
uneasiness
of
heathen
converts
on
account
of
the
loss
of
their
lupercalia
or
feasts
of
pan
the
worship
of
images
of
fragments
of
the
cross
or
bones
nails
and
other
relics
a
true
fetich
worship
was
cultivated
two
arguments
were
relied
on
for
the
authenticity
of
these
objects
the
authority
of
the
church
and
the
working
of
miracles
even
the
clothing
of
the
saints
and
the
earth
of
their
graves
were
venerated
from
palestine
were
brought
what
were
affirmed
to
be
the
skeletons
of
mark
and
james
and
other
ancient
worthies
the
apotheosis
of
the
old
roman
times
was
replaced
by
canonization
tutelary
saints
succeed
to
local
mythological
divinities
then
came
the
mystery
of
transubstantiation
or
the
conversion
of
bread
and
wine
by
the
priest
into
the
flesh
and
blood
of
christ
as
centuries
passed
the
paganization
became
more
and
more
complete
festivals
sacred
to
the
memory
of
the
lance
with
which
the
savior
side
was
pierced
the
nails
that
fastened
him
to
the
cross
and
the
crown
of
thorns
were
instituted
though
there
were
several
abbeys
that
possessed
this
last
peerless
relic
no
one
dared
to
say
that
it
was
impossible
they
could
all
be
authentic
we
may
read
with
advantage
the
remarks
made
by
bishop
newton
on
this
paganization
of
christianity
he
asks
is
not
the
worship
of
saints
and
angels
now
in
all
respects
the
same
that
the
worship
of
demons
was
in
former
times
the
name
only
is
different
the
thing
is
identically
the
same
the
deified
men
of
the
christians
are
substituted
for
the
deified
men
of
the
heathens
the
promoters
of
this
worship
were
sensible
that
it
was
the
same
and
that
the
one
succeeded
to
the
other
and
as
the
worship
is
the
same
so
likewise
it
is
performed
with
the
same
ceremonies
the
burning
of
incense
or
perfumes
on
several
altars
at
one
and
the
same
time
the
sprinkling
of
holy
water
or
a
mixture
of
salt
and
common
water
at
going
into
and
coming
out
of
places
of
public
worship
the
lighting
up
of
a
great
number
of
lamps
and
in
broad
daylight
before
altars
and
statues
of
these
deities
the
hanging
up
of
votive
offerings
and
rich
presents
as
attestations
of
so
many
miraculous
cures
and
deliverances
from
diseases
and
dangers
the
canonization
or
deification
of
deceased
worthies
the
assigning
of
distinct
provinces
or
prefectures
to
departed
heroes
and
saints
the
worshiping
and
adoring
of
the
dead
in
their
sepulchres
shrines
and
relics
the
consecrating
and
bowing
down
to
images
the
attributing
of
miraculous
powers
and
virtues
to
idols
the
setting
up
of
little
oratories
altars
and
statues
in
the
streets
and
highways
and
on
the
tops
of
mountains
the
carrying
of
images
and
relics
in
pompous
procession
with
numerous
lights
and
with
music
and
singing
flagellations
at
solemn
seasons
under
the
notion
of
penance
a
great
variety
of
religious
orders
and
fraternities
of
priests
the
shaving
of
priests
or
the
tonsure
as
it
is
called
on
the
crown
of
their
heads
the
imposing
of
celibacy
and
vows
of
chastity
on
the
religious
of
both
sexes
all
these
and
many
more
rites
and
ceremonies
are
equally
parts
of
pagan
and
popish
superstition
nay
the
very
same
temples
the
very
same
images
which
were
once
consecrated
to
jupiter
and
the
other
demons
are
now
consecrated
to
the
virgin
mary
and
the
other
saints
the
very
same
rites
and
inscriptions
are
ascribed
to
both
the
very
same
prodigies
and
miracles
are
related
of
these
as
of
those
in
short
almost
the
whole
of
paganism
is
converted
and
applied
to
popery
the
one
is
manifestly
formed
upon
the
same
plan
and
principles
as
the
other
so
that
there
is
not
only
a
conformity
but
even
a
uniformity
in
the
worship
of
ancient
and
modern
of
heathen
and
christian
rome
debasement
of
christianity
thus
far
bishop
newton
but
to
return
to
the
times
of
constantine
though
these
concessions
to
old
and
popular
ideas
were
permitted
and
even
encouraged
the
dominant
religious
party
never
for
a
moment
hesitated
to
enforce
its
decisions
by
the
aid
of
the
civil
power
an
aid
which
was
freely
given
constantine
thus
carried
into
effect
the
acts
of
the
council
of
nicea
in
the
affair
of
arius
he
even
ordered
that
whoever
should
find
a
book
of
that
heretic
and
not
burn
it
should
be
put
to
death
in
like
manner
nestor
was
by
theodosius
the
younger
banished
to
an
egyptian
oasis
the
pagan
party
included
many
of
the
old
aristocratic
families
of
the
empire
it
counted
among
its
adherents
all
the
disciples
of
the
old
philosophical
schools
it
looked
down
on
its
antagonist
with
contempt
it
asserted
that
knowledge
is
to
be
obtained
only
by
the
laborious
exercise
of
human
observation
and
human
reason
the
christian
party
asserted
that
all
knowledge
is
to
be
found
in
the
scriptures
and
in
the
traditions
of
the
church
that
in
the
written
revelation
god
had
not
only
given
a
criterion
of
truth
but
had
furnished
us
all
that
he
intended
us
to
know
the
scriptures
therefore
contain
the
sum
the
end
of
all
knowledge
the
clergy
with
the
emperor
at
their
back
would
endure
no
intellectual
competition
thus
came
into
prominence
what
were
termed
sacred
and
profane
knowledge
thus
came
into
presence
of
each
other
two
opposing
parties
one
relying
on
human
reason
as
its
guide
the
other
on
revelation
paganism
leaned
for
support
on
the
learning
of
its
philosophers
christianity
on
the
inspiration
of
its
fathers
the
church
thus
set
herself
forth
as
the
depository
and
arbiter
of
knowledge
she
was
ever
ready
to
resort
to
the
civil
power
to
compel
obedience
to
her
decisions
she
thus
took
a
course
which
determined
her
whole
future
career
she
became
a
in
the
intellectual
advancement
of
europe
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
the
reign
of
constantine
marks
the
epoch
of
the
transformation
of
christianity
from
a
religion
into
a
political
system
and
though
in
one
sense
that
system
was
degraded
into
an
idolatry
in
another
it
had
risen
into
a
development
of
the
old
greek
mythology
the
maxim
holds
good
in
the
social
as
well
as
in
the
mechanical
world
that
when
two
bodies
strike
the
form
of
both
is
changed
paganism
was
modified
by
christianity
christianity
by
paganism
the
trinitarian
dispute
in
the
trinitarian
controversy
which
first
broke
out
in
egypt
egypt
the
land
of
trinities
the
chief
point
in
discussion
was
to
define
the
position
of
the
son
there
lived
in
alexandria
a
presbyter
of
the
name
of
arius
a
disappointed
candidate
for
the
office
of
bishop
he
took
the
ground
that
there
was
a
time
when
from
the
very
nature
of
sonship
the
son
did
not
exist
and
a
time
at
which
he
commenced
to
be
asserting
that
it
is
the
necessary
condition
of
the
filial
relation
that
a
father
must
be
older
than
his
son
but
this
assertion
evidently
denied
the
coeternity
of
the
three
persons
of
the
trinity
it
suggested
a
subordination
or
inequality
among
them
and
indeed
implied
a
time
when
the
trinity
did
not
exist
hereupon
the
bishop
who
had
been
the
successful
competitor
against
arius
displayed
his
rhetorical
powers
in
public
debates
on
the
question
and
the
strife
spreading
the
jews
and
pagans
who
formed
a
very
large
portion
of
the
population
of
alexandria
amused
themselves
with
theatrical
representations
of
the
contest
on
the
stage
the
point
of
their
burlesques
being
the
equality
of
age
of
the
father
and
his
son
such
was
the
violence
the
controversy
at
length
assumed
that
the
matter
had
to
be
referred
to
the
emperor
at
first
he
looked
upon
the
dispute
as
altogether
frivolous
and
perhaps
in
truth
inclined
to
the
assertion
of
arius
that
in
the
very
nature
of
the
thing
a
father
must
be
older
than
his
son
so
great
however
was
the
pressure
laid
upon
him
that
he
was
eventually
compelled
to
summon
the
council
of
nicea
which
to
dispose
of
the
conflict
set
forth
a
formulary
or
creed
and
attached
to
it
this
anathema
the
holy
catholic
and
apostolic
church
anathematizes
those
who
say
that
there
was
a
time
when
the
son
of
god
was
not
and
that
before
he
was
begotten
he
was
not
and
that
he
was
made
out
of
nothing
or
out
of
another
substance
or
essence
and
is
created
or
changeable
or
alterable
constantine
at
once
enforced
the
decision
of
the
council
by
the
civil
power
a
few
years
subsequently
the
emperor
theodosius
prohibited
sacrifices
made
the
inspection
of
the
entrails
of
animals
a
capital
offense
and
forbade
any
one
entering
a
temple
he
instituted
inquisitors
of
faith
and
ordained
that
all
who
did
not
accord
with
the
belief
of
damasus
the
bishop
of
rome
and
peter
the
bishop
of
alexandria
should
be
driven
into
exile
and
deprived
of
civil
rights
those
who
presumed
to
celebrate
easter
on
the
same
day
as
the
jews
he
condemned
to
death
the
greek
language
was
now
ceasing
to
be
known
in
the
west
and
true
learning
was
becoming
extinct
at
this
time
the
bishopric
of
alexandria
was
held
by
one
theophilus
an
ancient
temple
of
osiris
having
been
given
to
the
christians
of
the
city
for
the
site
of
a
church
it
happened
that
in
digging
the
foundation
for
the
new
edifice
the
obscene
symbols
of
the
former
worship
chanced
to
be
found
these
with
more
zeal
than
modesty
theophilus
exhibited
in
the
to
public
derision
with
less
forbearance
than
the
christian
party
showed
when
it
was
insulted
in
the
theatre
during
the
trinitarian
dispute
the
pagans
resorted
to
violence
and
a
riot
ensued
they
held
the
serapion
as
their
headquarters
such
were
the
disorder
and
bloodshed
that
the
emperor
had
to
interfere
he
dispatched
a
rescript
to
alexandria
enjoining
the
bishop
theophilus
to
destroy
the
serapion
and
the
great
library
which
had
been
collected
by
the
ptolemies
and
had
escaped
the
fire
of
julius
caesar
was
by
that
fanatic
dispersed
the
murder
of
hypatia
the
bishopric
thus
held
by
theophilus
was
in
due
time
occupied
by
his
nephew
cyril
who
had
commended
himself
to
the
approval
of
the
alexandrian
congregations
as
a
successful
and
fashionable
preacher
it
was
he
who
had
so
much
to
do
with
the
introduction
of
the
worship
of
the
virgin
mary
his
hold
upon
the
audiences
of
the
giddy
city
was
however
much
weakened
by
hypatia
the
daughter
of
theon
the
mathematician
who
not
only
distinguished
herself
by
her
expositions
of
the
doctrines
of
plato
and
aristotle
but
also
by
her
comments
on
the
writings
of
apollonius
and
other
geometers
each
day
before
her
academy
stood
a
long
train
of
chariots
her
was
crowded
with
the
wealth
and
fashion
of
alexandria
they
came
to
listen
to
her
discourses
on
those
questions
which
man
in
all
ages
has
asked
but
which
never
yet
have
been
answered
what
am
i
where
am
i
what
can
i
know
hypatia
and
cyril
philosophy
and
bigotry
they
can
not
exist
together
so
cyril
felt
and
on
that
feeling
he
acted
as
hypatia
repaired
to
her
academy
she
was
assaulted
by
cyril
mob
a
mob
of
many
monks
stripped
naked
in
the
street
she
was
dragged
into
a
church
and
there
killed
by
the
club
of
peter
the
reader
the
corpse
was
cut
to
pieces
the
flesh
was
scraped
from
the
bones
with
shells
and
the
remnants
cast
into
a
fire
for
this
frightful
crime
cyril
was
never
called
to
account
it
seemed
to
be
admitted
that
the
end
sanctified
the
means
so
ended
greek
philosophy
in
alexandria
so
came
to
an
untimely
close
the
learning
that
the
ptolemies
had
done
so
much
to
promote
the
daughter
library
that
of
the
serapion
had
been
dispersed
the
fate
of
hypatia
was
a
warning
to
all
who
would
cultivate
profane
knowledge
henceforth
there
was
to
be
no
freedom
for
human
thought
every
one
must
think
as
the
ecclesiastical
authority
ordered
him
in
athens
itself
philosophy
awaited
its
doom
justinian
at
length
prohibited
its
teaching
and
caused
all
its
schools
in
that
city
to
be
closed
pelagius
while
these
events
were
transpiring
in
the
eastern
provinces
of
the
roman
empire
the
spirit
that
had
produced
them
was
displaying
itself
in
the
west
a
british
monk
who
had
assumed
the
name
of
pelagius
passed
through
western
europe
and
northern
africa
teaching
that
death
was
not
introduced
into
the
world
by
the
sin
of
adam
that
on
the
contrary
he
was
necessarily
and
by
nature
mortal
and
had
he
not
sinned
he
would
nevertheless
have
died
that
the
consequences
of
his
sins
were
confined
to
himself
and
did
not
affect
his
posterity
from
these
premises
pelagius
drew
certain
important
theological
conclusions
at
rome
pelagius
had
been
received
with
favor
at
carthage
at
the
instigation
of
augustine
he
was
denounced
by
a
synod
held
at
diospolis
he
was
acquitted
of
heresy
but
on
referring
the
matter
to
the
bishop
of
rome
innocent
he
was
on
the
contrary
condemned
it
happened
that
at
this
moment
innocent
died
and
his
successor
zosimus
annulled
his
judgment
and
declared
the
opinions
of
pelagius
to
be
orthodox
these
contradictory
decisions
are
still
often
referred
to
by
the
opponents
of
papal
infallibility
things
were
in
this
state
of
confusion
when
the
wily
african
bishops
through
the
influence
of
count
valerius
procured
from
the
emperor
an
edict
denouncing
pelagins
as
a
heretic
he
and
his
accomplices
were
condemned
to
exile
and
the
forfeiture
of
their
goods
to
affirm
that
death
was
in
the
world
before
the
fall
of
adam
was
a
state
crime
condemnation
of
pelagius
it
is
very
instructive
to
consider
the
principles
on
which
this
strange
decision
was
founded
since
the
question
was
purely
philosophical
one
might
suppose
that
it
would
have
been
discussed
on
natural
principles
instead
of
that
theological
considerations
alone
were
adduced
the
attentive
reader
will
have
remarked
in
tertullian
statement
of
the
principles
of
christianity
a
complete
absence
of
the
doctrines
of
original
sin
total
depravity
predestination
grace
and
atonement
the
intention
of
christianity
as
set
forth
by
him
has
nothing
in
common
with
the
plan
of
salvation
upheld
two
centuries
subsequently
it
is
to
augustine
a
carthaginian
that
we
are
indebted
for
the
precision
of
our
views
on
these
important
points
in
deciding
whether
death
had
been
in
the
world
before
the
fall
of
adam
or
whether
it
was
the
penalty
inflicted
on
the
world
for
his
sin
the
course
taken
was
to
ascertain
whether
the
views
of
pelagius
were
accordant
or
discordant
not
with
nature
but
with
the
theological
doctrines
of
augustine
and
the
result
has
been
such
as
might
be
expected
the
doctrine
declared
to
be
orthodox
by
ecclesiastical
authority
is
overthrown
by
the
unquestionable
discoveries
of
modern
science
long
before
a
human
being
had
appeared
upon
earth
millions
of
individuals
nay
more
thousands
of
species
and
even
genera
had
died
those
which
remain
with
us
are
an
insignificant
fraction
of
the
vast
hosts
that
have
passed
away
a
consequence
of
great
importance
issued
from
the
decision
of
the
pelagian
controversy
the
book
of
genesis
had
been
made
the
basis
of
christianity
if
in
a
theological
point
of
view
to
its
account
of
the
sin
in
the
garden
of
eden
and
the
transgression
and
punishment
of
adam
so
much
weight
had
been
attached
it
also
in
a
philosophical
point
of
view
became
the
grand
authority
of
patristic
science
astronomy
geology
geography
anthropology
chronology
and
indeed
all
the
various
departments
of
human
knowledge
were
made
to
conform
to
it
augustine
as
the
doctrines
of
augustine
have
had
the
effect
of
thus
placing
theology
in
antagonism
with
science
it
may
be
interesting
to
examine
briefly
some
of
the
more
purely
philosophical
views
of
that
great
man
for
this
purpose
we
may
appropriately
select
portions
of
his
study
of
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
as
contained
in
the
eleventh
twelfth
and
thirteenth
books
of
his
confessions
these
consist
of
philosophical
discussions
largely
interspersed
with
rhapsodies
he
prays
that
god
will
give
him
to
understand
the
scriptures
and
will
open
their
meaning
to
him
he
declares
that
in
them
there
is
nothing
superfluous
but
that
the
words
have
a
manifold
meaning
the
face
of
creation
testifies
that
there
has
been
a
creator
but
at
once
arises
the
question
how
and
when
did
he
make
heaven
and
earth
they
could
not
have
been
made
in
heaven
and
earth
the
world
could
not
have
been
made
in
the
world
nor
could
they
have
been
made
when
there
was
nothing
to
make
them
of
the
solution
of
this
fundamental
inquiry
augustine
finds
in
saying
thou
spakest
and
they
were
made
but
the
difficulty
does
not
end
here
augustine
goes
on
to
remark
that
the
syllables
thus
uttered
by
god
came
forth
in
succession
and
there
must
have
been
some
created
thing
to
express
the
words
this
created
thing
must
therefore
have
existed
before
heaven
and
earth
and
yet
there
could
have
been
no
corporeal
thing
before
heaven
and
earth
it
must
have
been
a
creature
because
the
words
passed
away
and
came
to
an
end
but
we
know
that
the
word
of
the
lord
endureth
forever
moreover
it
is
plain
that
the
words
thus
spoken
could
not
have
been
spoken
successively
but
simultaneously
else
there
would
have
been
time
and
change
succession
in
its
nature
implying
time
whereas
there
was
then
nothing
but
eternity
and
immortality
god
knows
and
says
eternally
what
takes
place
in
time
criticism
of
augustine
augustine
then
defines
not
without
much
mysticism
what
is
meant
by
the
opening
words
of
genesis
in
the
beginning
he
is
guided
to
his
conclusion
by
another
scriptural
passage
how
wonderful
are
thy
works
o
lord
in
wisdom
hast
thou
made
them
all
this
wisdom
is
the
beginning
and
in
that
beginning
the
lord
created
the
heaven
and
the
earth
but
he
adds
some
one
may
ask
was
god
doing
before
he
made
the
heaven
and
the
earth
for
if
at
any
particular
moment
he
began
to
employ
himself
that
means
time
not
eternity
in
eternity
nothing
transpires
the
whole
is
present
in
answering
this
question
he
can
not
forbear
one
of
those
touches
of
rhetoric
for
which
he
was
so
celebrated
i
will
not
answer
this
question
by
saying
that
he
was
preparing
hell
for
priers
into
his
mysteries
i
say
that
before
god
made
heaven
and
earth
he
did
not
make
any
thing
for
no
creature
could
be
made
before
any
creature
was
made
time
itself
is
a
creature
and
hence
it
could
not
possibly
exist
before
creation
what
then
is
time
the
past
is
not
the
future
is
not
the
present
who
can
tell
what
it
is
unless
it
be
that
which
has
no
duration
between
two
nonentities
there
is
no
such
thing
as
long
time
or
short
time
for
there
are
no
such
things
as
the
past
and
the
future
they
have
no
existence
except
in
the
soul
the
style
in
which
augustine
conveyed
his
ideas
is
that
of
a
rhapsodical
conversation
with
god
his
works
are
an
incoherent
dream
that
the
reader
may
appreciate
this
remark
i
might
copy
almost
at
random
any
of
his
paragraphs
the
following
is
from
the
twelfth
book
this
then
is
what
i
conceive
o
my
god
when
i
hear
thy
scripture
saying
in
the
beginning
god
made
heaven
and
earth
and
the
earth
was
invisible
and
without
form
and
darkness
was
upon
the
deep
and
not
mentioning
what
day
thou
createdst
them
this
is
what
i
conceive
that
because
of
the
heaven
of
heavens
that
intellectual
heaven
whose
intelligences
know
all
at
once
not
in
part
not
darkly
not
through
a
glass
but
as
a
whole
in
manifestation
face
to
face
not
this
thing
now
and
that
thing
anon
but
as
i
said
know
all
at
once
without
any
succession
of
times
and
because
of
the
earth
invisible
and
without
form
without
any
succession
of
times
which
succession
presents
thing
now
that
thing
anon
because
where
there
is
no
form
there
is
no
distinction
of
things
it
is
then
on
account
of
these
two
a
primitive
formed
and
a
primitive
formless
the
one
heaven
but
the
heaven
of
heavens
the
other
earth
but
the
earth
movable
and
without
form
because
of
these
two
do
i
conceive
did
thy
scripture
say
without
mention
of
days
in
the
beginning
god
created
the
heaven
and
the
earth
for
forthwith
it
subjoined
what
earth
it
spake
of
and
also
in
that
the
firmament
is
recorded
to
be
created
the
second
day
and
called
heaven
it
conveys
to
us
of
which
heaven
he
before
spake
without
mention
of
days
wondrous
depth
of
thy
words
whose
surface
behold
is
before
us
inviting
to
little
ones
yet
are
they
a
wondrous
depth
o
my
god
a
wondrous
depth
it
is
awful
to
look
therein
an
awfulness
of
honor
and
a
trembling
of
love
the
enemies
thereof
i
hate
vehemently
o
that
thou
wouldst
slay
them
with
thy
sword
that
they
might
no
longer
be
enemies
to
it
for
so
do
i
love
to
have
them
slain
unto
themselves
that
they
may
live
unto
thee
as
an
example
of
the
hermeneutical
manner
in
which
augustine
unfolded
the
concealed
facts
of
the
scriptures
i
may
cite
the
following
from
the
thirteenth
book
of
the
confessions
his
object
is
to
show
that
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
is
contained
in
the
mosaic
narrative
of
the
creation
lo
now
the
trinity
appears
unto
me
in
a
glass
darkly
which
is
thou
my
god
because
thou
o
father
in
him
who
is
the
beginning
of
our
wisdom
which
is
thy
wisdom
born
of
thyself
equal
unto
thee
and
coeternal
that
is
in
thy
son
createdst
heaven
and
earth
much
now
have
we
said
of
the
heaven
of
heavens
and
of
the
earth
invisible
and
without
form
and
of
the
darksome
deep
in
reference
to
the
wandering
instability
of
its
spiritual
deformity
unless
it
had
been
converted
unto
him
from
whom
it
had
its
then
degree
of
life
and
by
his
enlightening
became
a
beauteous
life
and
the
heaven
of
that
heaven
which
was
afterward
set
between
water
and
water
and
under
the
name
of
god
i
now
held
the
father
who
made
these
things
and
under
the
name
of
the
beginning
the
son
in
whom
he
made
these
things
and
believing
as
i
did
my
god
as
the
trinity
i
searched
further
in
his
holy
words
and
lo
thy
spirit
moved
upon
the
waters
behold
the
trinity
my
god
father
and
son
and
holy
ghost
creator
of
all
creation
that
i
might
convey
to
my
reader
a
just
impression
of
the
character
of
augustine
philosophical
writings
i
have
in
the
two
quotations
here
given
substituted
for
my
own
translation
that
of
the
rev
pusey
as
contained
in
vol
of
the
library
of
fathers
of
the
holy
catholic
church
published
at
oxford
considering
the
eminent
authority
which
has
been
attributed
to
the
writings
of
augustine
by
the
religious
world
for
nearly
fifteen
centuries
it
is
proper
to
speak
of
them
with
respect
and
indeed
it
is
not
necessary
to
do
otherwise
the
paragraphs
here
quoted
criticise
themselves
no
one
did
more
than
this
father
to
bring
science
and
religion
into
antagonism
it
was
mainly
he
who
diverted
the
bible
from
its
true
office
a
guide
to
purity
of
life
and
placed
it
in
the
perilous
position
of
being
the
arbiter
of
human
knowledge
an
audacious
tyranny
over
the
mind
of
man
the
example
once
set
there
was
no
want
of
followers
the
works
of
the
great
greek
philosophers
were
stigmatized
as
profane
the
transcendently
glorious
achievements
of
the
museum
of
alexandria
were
hidden
from
sight
by
a
cloud
of
ignorance
mysticism
and
unintelligible
jargon
out
of
which
there
too
often
flashed
the
destroying
lightnings
of
ecclesiastical
vengeance
a
divine
revelation
of
science
admits
of
no
improvement
no
change
no
advance
it
discourages
as
needless
and
indeed
as
presumptuous
all
new
discovery
considering
it
as
an
unlawful
prying
into
things
which
it
was
the
intention
of
god
to
conceal
what
then
is
that
sacred
that
revealed
science
declared
by
the
fathers
to
be
the
sum
of
all
knowledge
it
likened
all
phenomena
natural
and
spiritual
to
human
acts
it
saw
in
the
almighty
the
eternal
only
a
gigantic
man
the
patristic
philosophy
as
to
the
earth
it
affirmed
that
it
is
a
flat
surface
over
which
the
sky
is
spread
like
a
dome
or
as
augustine
tells
us
is
stretched
like
a
skin
in
this
the
sun
and
moon
and
stars
move
so
that
they
may
give
light
by
day
and
by
night
to
man
the
earth
was
made
of
matter
created
by
god
out
of
nothing
and
with
all
the
tribes
of
animals
and
plants
inhabiting
it
was
finished
in
six
days
above
the
sky
or
firmament
is
heaven
in
the
dark
and
fiery
space
beneath
the
earth
is
hell
the
earth
is
the
central
and
most
important
body
of
the
universe
all
other
things
being
intended
for
and
subservient
to
it
as
to
man
he
was
made
out
of
the
dust
of
the
earth
at
first
he
was
alone
but
subsequently
woman
was
formed
from
one
of
his
ribs
he
is
the
greatest
and
choicest
of
the
works
of
god
he
was
placed
in
a
paradise
near
the
banks
of
the
euphrates
and
was
very
wise
and
very
pure
but
having
tasted
of
the
forbidden
fruit
and
thereby
broken
the
commandment
given
to
him
he
was
condemned
to
labor
and
to
death
the
descendants
of
the
first
man
undeterred
by
his
punishment
pursued
such
a
career
of
wickedness
that
it
became
necessary
to
destroy
them
a
deluge
therefore
flooded
the
face
of
the
earth
and
rose
over
the
tops
of
the
mountains
having
accomplished
its
purpose
the
water
was
dried
up
by
a
wind
from
this
catastrophe
noah

his
three
sons
with
their

were

of

as

for

let
us
listen
to
what
some
of
these
authorities
say
in
support
of
their
assertions
thus
lactantius
referring
to
the
heretical
doctrine
of
the
globular
form
of
the
earth
remarks
is
it
possible
that
men
can
be
so
absurd
as
to
believe
that
the
crops
and
the
trees
on
the
other
side
of
the
earth
hang
downward
and
that
men
have
their
feet
higher
than
their
heads
if
you
ask
them
how
they
defend
these
monstrosities
how
things
do
not
fall
away
from
the
earth
on
that
side
they
reply
that
the
nature
of
things
is
such
that
heavy
bodies
tend
toward
the
centre
like
the
spokes
of
a
wheel
while
light
bodies
as
clouds
smoke
fire
tend
from
the
centre
to
the
heavens
on
all
sides
now
i
am
really
at
a
loss
what
to
say
of
those
who
when
they
have
once
gone
wrong
steadily
persevere
in
their
folly
and
defend
one
absurd
opinion
by
another
on
the
question
of
the
antipodes
augustine
asserts
that
it
is
impossible
there
should
be
inhabitants
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
earth
since
no
such
race
is
recorded
by
scripture
among
the
descendants
of
adam
perhaps
however
the
most
unanswerable
argument
against
the
sphericity
of
the
earth
was
this
that
in
the
day
of
judgment
men
on
the
other
side
of
a
globe
could
not
see
the
lord
descending
through
the
air
it
is
unnecessary
for
me
to
say
any
thing
respecting
the
introduction
of
death
into
the
world
the
continual
interventions
of
spiritual
agencies
in
the
course
of
events
the
offices
of
angels
and
devils
the
expected
conflagration
of
the
earth
the
tower
of
babel
the
confusion
of
tongues
the
dispersion
of
mankind
the
interpretation
of
natural
phenomena
as
eclipses
the
rainbow
etc
above
all
i
abstain
from
commenting
on
the
patristic
conceptions
of
the
almighty
they
are
too
anthropomorphic
and
wanting
in
sublimity
perhaps
however
i
may
quote
from
cosmas
indicopleustes
the
views
that
were
entertained
in
the
sixth
century
he
wrote
a
work
entitled
christian
topography
the
chief
intent
of
which
was
to
confute
the
heretical
opinion
of
the
globular
form
of
the
earth
and
the
pagan
assertion
that
there
is
a
temperate
zone
on
the
southern
side
of
the
torrid
he
affirms
that
according
to
the
true
orthodox
system
of
geography
the
earth
is
a
quadrangular
plane
extending
four
hundred
days
journey
east
and
west
and
exactly
half
as
much
north
and
south
that
it
is
inclosed
by
mountains
on
which
the
sky
rests
that
one
on
the
north
side
huger
than
the
others
by
intercepting
the
rays
of
the
sun
produces
night
and
that
the
plane
of
the
earth
is
not
set
exactly
horizontally
but
with
a
little
inclination
from
the
north
hence
the
euphrates
tigris
and
other
rivers
running
southward
are
rapid
but
the
nile
having
to
run
has
necessarily
a
very
slow
current
the
venerable
bede
writing
in
the
seventh
century
tells
us
that
the
creation
was
accomplished
in
six
days
and
that
the
earth
is
its
centre
and
its
primary
object
the
heaven
is
of
a
fiery
and
subtile
nature
round
and
equidistant
in
every
part
as
a
canopy
from
the
centre
of
the
earth
it
turns
round
every
day
with
ineffable
rapidity
only
moderated
by
the
resistance
of
the
seven
planets
three
above
the
sun
saturn
jupiter
mars
then
the
sun
three
below
venus
mercury
the
moon
the
stars
go
round
in
their
fixed
courses
the
northern
perform
the
shortest
circle
the
highest
heaven
has
its
proper
limit
it
contains
the
angelic
virtues
who
descend
upon
earth
assume
ethereal
bodies
perform
human
functions
and
return
the
heaven
is
tempered
with
glacial
waters
lest
it
should
be
set
on
fire
the
inferior
heaven
is
called
the
firmament
because
it
separates
the
superincumbent
waters
from
the
waters
below
the
firmamental
waters
are
lower
than
the
spiritual
heaven
higher
than
all
corporeal
beings
reserved
some
say
for
a
second
deluge
others
more
truly
to
temper
the
fire
of
the
fixed
stars
was
it
for
this
preposterous
scheme
this
product
of
ignorance
and
audacity
that
the
works
of
the
greek
philosophers
were
to
be
given
up
it
was
none
too
soon
that
the
great
critics
who
appeared
at
the
reformation
by
comparing
the
works
of
these
writers
with
one
another
brought
them
to
their
proper
level
and
taught
us
to
look
upon
them
all
with
contempt
of
this
presumptuous
system
the
strangest
part
was
its
logic
the
nature
of
its
proofs
it
relied
upon
a
fact
was
supposed
to
be
demonstrated
by
an
astounding
illustration
of
something
else
an
arabian
writer
referring
to
this
says
if
a
conjurer
should
say
to
me
are
more
than
ten
and
in
proof
of
it
i
will
change
this
stick
into
a
serpent
i
might
be
surprised
at
his
legerdemain
but
i
certainly
should
not
admit
his
assertion
yet
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
such
was
the
accepted
logic
and
all
over
europe
propositions
equally
absurd
were
accepted
on
equally
ridiculous
proof
since
the
party
that
had
become
dominant
in
the
empire
could
not
furnish
works
capable
of
intellectual
competition
with
those
of
the
great
pagan
authors
and
since
it
was
impossible
for
it
to
accept
a
position
of
inferiority
there
arose
a
political
necessity
for
the
discouragement
and
even
persecution
of
profane
learning
the
persecution
of
the
platonists
under
valentinian
was
due
to
that
necessity
they
were
accused
of
magic
and
many
of
them
were
put
to
death
the
profession
of
philosophy
had
become
dangerous
it
was
a
state
crime
in
its
stead
there
arose
a
passion
for
the
marvelous
a
spirit
of
superstition
egypt
exchanged
the
great
men
who
had
made
her
museum
immortal
for
bands
of
solitary
monks
and
sequestered
virgins
with
which
she
was
overrun

the

their
principles
rejecting

of

and
every
thing
in
opposition

prepares
to
make

on
the
roman
his
successors
conquer
syria
egypt
asia
minor
north
africa
spain
and
invade
france
as
the
result
of
this
conflict
the
doctrine
of
the
unity
of
god
was
established
in
the
greater
part
of
the
roman
empire
the
cultivation
of
science
was
restored
and
christendom
lost
many
of
her
most
illustrious
capitals
as
alexandria
carthage
and
above
all
jerusalem
the
policy
of
the
byzantine
court
had
given
to
primitive
christianity
a
paganized
form
which
it
had
spread
over
all
the
idolatrous
populations
constituting
the
empire
there
had
been
an
amalgamation
of
the
two
parties
christianity
had
modified
paganism
paganism
had
modified
christianity
the
limits
of
this
adulterated
religion
were
the
confines
of
the
roman
empire
with
this
great
extension
there
had
come
to
the
christian
party
political
influence
and
wealth
no
insignificant
portion
of
the
vast
public
revenues
found
their
way
into
the
treasuries
of
the
church
as
under
such
circumstances
must
ever
be
the
case
there
were
many
competitors
for
the
spoils
men
who
under
the
mask
of
zeal
for
the
predominant
faith
sought
only
the
enjoyment
of
its
emoluments
ecclesiastical
disputes
under
the
early
emperors
conquest
had
reached
its
culmination
the
empire
was
completed
there
remained
no
adequate
objects
for
military
life
the
days
of
and
the
plundering
of
provinces
were
over
for
the
ambitious
however
another
path
was
open
other
objects
presented
a
successful
career
in
the
church
led
to
results
not
unworthy
of
comparison
with
those
that
in
former
days
had
been
attained
by
a
successful
career
in
the
army
the
ecclesiastical
and
indeed
it
may
be
said
much
of
the
political
history
of
that
time
turns
on
the
struggles
of
the
bishops
of
the
three
great
metropolitan
cities
constantinople
alexandria
rome
for
supremacy
constantinople
based
her
claims
on
the
fact
that
she
was
the
existing
imperial
city
alexandria
pointed
to
her
commercial
and
literary
position
rome
to
her
souvenirs
but
the
patriarch
of
constantinople
labored
under
the
disadvantage
that
he
was
too
closely
under
the
eye
and
as
he
found
to
his
cost
too
often
under
the
hand
of
the
emperor
distance
gave
security
to
the
episcopates
of
alexandria
and
rome
ecclesiastical
disputes
religious
disputations
in
the
east
have
generally
turned
on
diversities
of
opinion
respecting
the
nature
and
attributes
of
god
in
the
west
on
the
relations
and
life
of
man
this
peculiarity
has
been
strikingly
manifested
in
the
transformations
that
christianity
has
undergone
in
asia
and
europe
respectively
accordingly
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
speaking
all
the
eastern
provinces
of
the
roman
empire
exhibited
an
intellectual
anarchy
there
were
fierce
quarrels
respecting
the
trinity
the
essence
of
god
the
position
of
the
son
the
nature
of
the
holy
spirit
the
influences
of
the
virgin
mary
the
triumphant
clamor
first
of
one
then
of
another
sect
was
confirmed
sometimes
by
sometimes
by
bloodshed
no
attempt
was
ever
made
to
submit
the
rival
opinions
to
logical
examination
all
parties
however
agreed
in
this
that
the
imposture
of
the
old
classical
pagan
forms
of
faith
was
demonstrated
by
the
facility
with
which
they
had
been
overthrown
the
triumphant
ecclesiastics
proclaimed
that
the
images
of
the
gods
had
failed
to
defend
themselves
when
the
time
of
trial
came
polytheistic
ideas
have
always
been
held
in
repute
by
the
southern
european
races
the
semitic
have
maintained
the
unity
of
god
perhaps
this
is
due
to
the
fact
as
a
recent
author
has
suggested
that
a
diversified
landscape
of
mountains
and
valleys
islands
and
rivers
and
gulfs
predisposes
man
to
a
belief
in
a
multitude
of
divinities
a
vast
sandy
desert
the
illimitable
ocean
impresses
him
with
an
idea
of
the
oneness
of
god
political
reasons
had
led
the
emperors
to
look
with
favor
on
the
admixture
of
christianity
and
paganism
and
doubtless
by
this
means
the
bitterness
of
the
rivalry
between
those
antagonists
was
somewhat
abated
the
heaven
of
the
popular
the
fashionable
christianity
was
the
old
olympus
from
which
the
venerable
greek
divinities
had
been
removed
there
on
a
great
white
throne
sat
god
the
father
on
his
right
the
son
and
then
the
blessed
virgin
clad
in
a
golden
robe
and
covered
with
various
female
adornments
on
the
left
sat
god
the
holy
ghost
surrounding
these
thrones
were
hosts
of
angels
with
their
harps
the
vast
expanse
beyond
was
filled
with
tables
seated
at
which
the
happy
spirits
of
the
just
enjoyed
a
perpetual
banquet
if
satisfied
with
this
picture
of
happiness
illiterate
persons
never
inquired
how
the
details
of
such
a
heaven
were
carried
out
or
how
much
pleasure
there
could
be
in
the
ennui
of
such
an
eternally
unchanging
unmoving
scene
it
was
not
so
with
the
intelligent
as
we
are
soon
to
see
there
were
among
the
higher
ecclesiastics
those
who
rejected
with
sentiments
of
horror
these
carnal
these
materialistic
conceptions
and
raised
their
protesting
voices
in
vindication
of
the
attributes
of
the
omnipresent
the
almighty
god
egyptian
doctrines
in
the
paganization
of
religion
now
in
all
directions
taking
place
it
became
the
interest
of
every
bishop
to
procure
an
adoption
of
the
ideas
which
time
out
of
mind
had
been
current
in
the
community
under
his
charge
the
egyptians
had
already
thus
forced
on
the
church
their
peculiar
trinitarian
views
and
now
they
were
resolved
that
under
the
form
of
the
adoration
of
the
virgin
mary
the
worship
of
isis
should
be
restored
the
nestorians
it
so
happened
that
nestor
the
bishop
of
antioch
who
entertained
the
philosophical
views
of
theodore
of
mopsuestia
had
been
called
by
the
emperor
theodosius
the
younger
to
the
episcopate
of
constantinople
nestor
rejected
the
base
popular
anthropomorphism
looking
upon
it
as
little
better
than
blasphemous
and
pictured
to
himself
an
awful
eternal
divinity
who
pervaded
the
universe
and
had
none
of
the
aspects
or
attributes
of
man
nestor
was
deeply
imbued
with
the
doctrines
of
aristotle
and
attempted
to
coordinate
them
with
what
he
considered
to
be
orthodox
christian
tenets
between
him
and
cyril
the
bishop
or
patriarch
of
alexandria
a
quarrel
accordingly
arose
cyril
represented
the
paganizing
nestor
the
philosophizing
party
of
the
church
this
was
that
cyril
who
had
murdered
hypatia
cyril
was
determined
that
the
worship
of
the
virgin
as
the
mother
of
god
should
be
recognized
nestor
was
determined
that
it
should
not
in
a
sermon
delivered
in
the
metropolitan
church
at
constantinople
he
vindicated
the
attributes
of
the
eternal
the
almighty
god
and
can
this
god
have
a
mother
he
exclaimed
in
other
sermons
and
writings
he
set
forth
with
more
precision
his
ideas
that
the
virgin
should
be
considered
not
as
the
mother
of
god
but
as
the
mother
of
the
human
portion
of
christ
that
portion
being
as
essentially
distinct
from
the
divine
as
is
a
temple
from
its
contained
deity
persecution
and
death
of
nestor
instigated
by
the
monks
of
alexandria
the
monks
of
constantinople
took
up
arms
in
behalf
of
the
mother
of
god
the
quarrel
rose
to
such
a
pitch
that
the
emperor
was
constrained
to
summon
a
council
to
meet
at
ephesus
in
the
mean
time
cyril
had
given
a
bribe
of
many
pounds
of
gold
to
the
chief
eunuch
of
the
imperial
court
and
had
thereby
obtained
the
influence
of
the
emperor
sister
the
holy
virgin
of
the
court
of
heaven
thus
found
an
ally
of
her
own
sex
in
the
holy
virgin
of
the
emperor
court
cyril
hastened
to
the
council
attended
by
a
mob
of
men
and
women
of
the
baser
sort
he
at
once
assumed
the
presidency
and
in
the
midst
of
a
tumult
had
the
emperor
rescript
read
before
the
syrian
bishops
could
arrive
a
single
day
served
to
complete
his
triumph
all
offers
of
accommodation
on
the
part
of
nestor
were
refused
his
explanations
were
not
read
he
was
condemned
unheard
on
the
arrival
of
the
syrian
ecclesiastics
a
meeting
of
protest
was
held
by
them
a
riot
with
much
bloodshed
ensued
in
the
cathedral
of
john
nestor
was
abandoned
by
the
court
and
eventually
exiled
to
an
egyptian
oasis
his
persecutors
tormented
him
as
long
as
he
lived
by
every
means
in
their
power
and
at
his
death
gave
out
that
his
blasphemous
tongue
had
been
devoured
by
worms
and
that
from
the
heats
of
an
egyptian
desert
he
had
escaped
only
into
the
hotter
torments
of
hell
the
overthrow
and
punishment
of
nestor
however
by
no
means
destroyed
his
opinions
he
and
his
followers
insisting
on
the
plain
inference
of
the
last
verse
of
the
first
chapter
of
matthew
together
with
the
and
verses
of
the
thirteenth
of
the
same
gospel
could
never
be
brought
to
an
acknowledgment
of
the
perpetual
virginity
of
the
new
queen
of
heaven
their
philosophical
tendencies
were
soon
indicated
by
their
actions
while
their
leader
was
tormented
in
an
african
oasis
many
of
them
emigrated
to
the
euphrates
and
established
the
chaldean
church
under
their
auspices
the
college
of
edessa
was
founded
from
the
college
of
nisibis
issued
those
doctors
who
spread
nestor
tenets
through
syria
arabia
india
tartary
china
egypt
the
nestorians
of
course
adopted
the
philosophy
of
aristotle
and
translated
the
works
of
that
great
writer
into
syriac
and
persian
they
also
made
similar
translations
of
later
works
such
as
those
of
pliny
in
connection
with
the
jews
they
founded
the
medical
college
of
djondesabour
their
missionaries
disseminated
the
nestorian
form
of
christianity
to
such
an
extent
over
asia
that
its
worshipers
eventually
outnumbered
all
the
european
christians
of
the
greek
and
roman
churches
combined
it
may
be
particularly
remarked
that
in
arabia
they
had
a
bishop
the
persian
campaign
the
dissensions
between
constantinople
and
alexandria
had
thus
filled
all
western
asia
with
sectaries
ferocious
in
their
contests
with
each
other
and
many
of
them
burning
with
hatred
against
the
imperial
power
for
the
persecutions
it
had
inflicted
on
them
a
religious
revolution
the
consequences
of
which
are
felt
in
our
own
times
was
the
result
it
affected
the
whole
world
we
shall
gain
a
clear
view
of
this
great
event
if
we
consider
separately
the
two
acts
into
which
it
may
be
decomposed
the
temporary
overthrow
of
asiatic
christianity
by
the
persians
the
decisive
and
final
reformation
under
the
arabians
it
happened
that
by
one
of
those
revolutions
so
frequent
in
oriental
courts
chosroes
the
lawful
heir
to
the
persian
throne
was
compelled
to
seek
refuge
in
the
byzantine
empire
and
implore
the
aid
of
the
emperor
maurice
that
aid
was
cheerfully
given
a
brief
and
successful
campaign
restored
chosroes
to
the
throne
of
his
ancestors
but
the
glories
of
this
generous
campaign
could
not
preserve
maurice
himself
a
mutiny
broke
out
in
the
roman
army
headed
by
phocas
a
centurion
the
statues
of
the
emperor
were
overthrown
the
patriarch
of
constantinople
having
declared
that
he
had
assured
himself
of
the
orthodoxy
of
phocas
consecrated
him
emperor
the
unfortunate
maurice
was
dragged
from
a
sanctuary
in
which
he
had
sought
refuge
his
five
sons
were
beheaded
before
his
eyes
and
then
he
was
put
to
death
his
empress
was
inveigled
from
the
church
of
sophia
tortured
and
with
her
three
young
daughters
beheaded
the
adherents
of
the
massacred
family
were
pursued
with
ferocious
vindictiveness
of
some
the
eyes
were
blinded
of
others
the
tongues
were
torn
out
or
the
feet
and
hands
cut
off
some
were
whipped
to
death
others
were
burnt
when
the
news
reached
rome
pope
gregory
received
it
with
exultation
praying
that
the
hands
of
phocas
might
be
strengthened
against
all
his
enemies
as
an
equivalent
for
this
subserviency
he
was
greeted
with
the
title
of
universal
bishop
the
cause
of
his
action
as
well
as
of
that
of
the
patriarch
of
constantinople
was
doubtless
the
fact
that
maurice
was
suspected
of
magrian
tendencies
into
which
he
had
been
lured
by
the
persians
the
mob
of
constantinople
had
hooted
after
him
in
the
streets
branding
him
as
a
marcionite
a
sect
which
believed
in
the
magian
doctrine
of
two
conflicting
principles
with
very
different
sentiments
chosroes
heard
of
the
murder
of
his
friend
phocas
had
sent
him
the
heads
of
maurice
and
his
sons
the
persian
king
turned
from
the
ghastly
spectacle
with
horror
and
at
once
made
ready
to
avenge
the
wrongs
of
his
benefactor
by
war
the
expedition
of
heraclius
the
exarch
of
africa
heraclius
one
of
the
chief
officers
of
the
state
also
received
the
shocking
tidings
with
indignation
he
was
determined
that
the
imperial
purple
should
not
be
usurped
by
an
obscure
centurion
of
disgusting
aspect
the
person
of
this
phocas
was
diminutive
and
deformed
the
closeness
of
his
shaggy
eyebrows
his
red
hair
his
beardless
chin
were
in
keeping
with
his
cheek
disfigured
and
discolored
by
a
formidable
scar
ignorant
of
letters
of
laws
and
even
of
arms
he
indulged
in
an
ample
privilege
of
lust
and
drunkenness
at
first
heraclius
refused
tribute
and
obedience
to
him
then
admonished
by
age
and
infirmities
he
committed
the
dangerous
enterprise
of
resistance
to
his
son
of
the
same
name
a
prosperous
voyage
from
carthage
soon
brought
the
younger
heraclius
in
front
of
constantinople
the
inconstant
clergy
senate
and
people
of
the
city
joined
him
the
usurper
was
seized
in
his
palace
and
beheaded
invasion
of
chosroes
but
the
revolution
that
had
taken
place
in
constantinople
did
not
arrest
the
movements
of
the
persian
king
his
magian
priests
had
warned
him
to
act
independently
of
the
greeks
whose
superstition
they
declared
was
devoid
of
all
truth
and
justice
chosroes
therefore
crossed
the
euphrates
his
army
was
received
with
transport
by
the
syrian
sectaries
insurrections
in
his
favor
everywhere
breaking
out
in
succession
antioch
caesarea
damascus
fell
jerusalem
itself
was
taken
by
storm
the
sepulchre
of
christ
the
churches
of
constantine
and
of
helena
were
given
to
the
flames
the
savior
cross
was
sent
as
a
trophy
to
persia
the
churches
were
rifled
of
their
riches
the
sacred
relics
collected
by
superstition
were
dispersed
egypt
was
invaded
conquered
and
annexed
to
the
persian
empire
the
patriarch
of
alexandria
escaped
by
flight
to
cyprus
the
african
coast
to
tripoli
was
seized
on
the
north
asia
minor
was
subdued
and
for
ten
years
the
persian
forces
encamped
on
the
shores
of
the
bosporus
in
front
of
constantinople
in
his
extremity
heraclius
begged
for
peace
i
will
never
give
peace
to
the
emperor
of
rome
replied
the
proud
persian
till
he
has
abjured
his
crucified
god
and
embraced
the
worship
of
the
sun
after
a
long
delay
terms
were
however
secured
and
the
roman
empire
was
ransomed
at
the
price
of
a
thousand
talents
of
gold
a
thousand
talents
of
silver
a
thousand
silk
robes
a
thousand
horses
and
a
thousand
virgins
but
heraclius
submitted
only
for
a
moment
he
found
means
not
only
to
restore
his
affairs
but
to
retaliate
on
the
persian
empire
the
operations
by
which
he
achieved
this
result
were
worthy
of
the
most
brilliant
days
of
rome
invasion
of
chosroes
though
her
military
renown
was
thus
recovered
though
her
territory
was
regained
there
was
something
that
the
roman
empire
had
irrecoverably
lost
religious
faith
could
never
be
restored
in
face
of
the
world
magianism
had
insulted
christianity
by
profaning
her
most
sacred
places
bethlehem
gethsemane
calvary
by
burning
the
sepulchre
of
christ
by
rifling
and
destroying
the
churches
by
scattering
to
the
winds
priceless
relics
by
carrying
off
with
shouts
of
laughter
the
cross
miracles
had
once
abounded
in
syria
in
egypt
in
asia
minor
there
was
not
a
church
which
had
not
its
long
catalogue
of
them
very
often
they
were
displayed
on
unimportant
occasions
and
in
insignificant
cases
in
this
supreme
moment
when
such
aid
was
most
urgently
demanded
not
a
miracle
was
worked
amazement
filled
the
christian
populations
of
the
east
when
they
witnessed
these
persian
sacrileges
perpetrated
with
impunity
the
heavens
should
have
rolled
asunder
the
earth
should
have
opened
her
abysses
the
sword
of
the
almighty
should
have
flashed
in
the
sky
the
fate
of
sennacherib
should
have
been
repeated
but
it
was
not
so
in
the
land
of
miracles
amazement
was
followed
by
consternation
consternation
died
out
in
disbelief
but
dreadful
as
it
was
the
persian
conquest
was
but
a
prelude
to
the
great
event
the
story
of
which
we
have
now
to
relate
the
southern
revolt
against
christianity
its
issue
was
the
loss
of
of
her
geographical
possessions
asia
africa
and
part
of
europe
mohammed
in
the
summer
of
of
the
christian
era
there
came
to
bozrah
a
town
on
the
confines
of
syria
south
of
damascus
a
caravan
of
camels
it
was
from
mecca
and
was
laden
with
the
costly
products
of
south
arabia
arabia
the
happy
the
conductor
of
the
caravan
one
abou
taleb
and
his
nephew
a
lad
of
twelve
years
were
hospitably
received
and
entertained
at
the
nestorian
convent
of
the
town
the
monks
of
this
convent
soon
found
that
their
young
visitor
halibi
or
mohammed
was
the
nephew
of
the
guardian
of
the
caaba
the
sacred
temple
of
the
arabs
one
of
them
by
name
bahira
spared
no
pains
to
secure
his
conversion
from
the
idolatry
in
which
he
had
been
brought
up
he
found
the
boy
not
only
precociously
intelligent
but
eagerly
desirous
of
information
especially
on
matters
relating
to
religion
in
mohammed
own
country
the
chief
object
of
meccan
worship
was
a
black
meteoric
stone
kept
in
the
caaba
with
three
hundred
and
sixty
subordinate
idols
representing
the
days
of
the
year
as
the
year
was
then
counted
at
this
time
as
we
have
seen
the
christian
church
through
the
ambition
and
wickedness
of
its
clergy
had
been
brought
into
a
condition
of
anarchy
councils
had
been
held
on
various
pretenses
while
the
real
motives
were
concealed
too
often
they
were
scenes
of
violence
bribery
corruption
in
the
west
such
were
the
temptations
of
riches
luxury
and
power
presented
by
the
episcopates
that
the
election
of
a
bishop
was
often
disgraced
by
frightful
murders
in
the
east
in
consequence
of
the
policy
of
the
court
of
constantinople
the
church
had
been
torn
in
pieces
by
contentions
and
schisms
among
a
countless
host
of
disputants
may
be
mentioned
arians
basilidians
carpocratians
collyridians
eutychians
gnostics
jacobites
marcionites
marionites
nestorians
sabellians
valentinians
of
these
the
marionites
regarded
the
trinity
as
consisting
of
god
the
father
god
the
son
and
god
the
virgin
mary
the
collyridians
worshiped
the
virgin
as
a
divinity
offering
her
sacrifices
of
cakes
the
nestorians
as
we
have
seen
denied
that
god
had
a
mother
they
prided
themselves
on
being
the
inheritors
the
possessors
of
the
science
of
old
greece
but
though
they
were
irreconcilable
in
matters
of
faith
there
was
one
point
in
which
all
these
sects
agreed
ferocious
hatred
and
persecution
of
each
other
arabia
an
unconquered
land
of
liberty
stretching
from
the
indian
ocean
to
the
desert
of
syria
gave
them
all
as
the
tide
of
fortune
successively
turned
a
refuge
it
had
been
so
from
the
old
times
thither
after
the
roman
conquest
of
palestine
vast
numbers
of
jews
escaped
thither
immediately
after
his
conversion
paul
tells
the
galatians
that
he
retired
the
deserts
were
now
filled
with
christian
anchorites
and
among
the
chief
tribes
of
the
arabs
many
proselytes
had
been
made
here
and
there
churches
had
been
built
the
christian
princes
of
abyssinia
who
were
nestorians
held
the
southern
province
of
arabia
yemen
in
possession
by
the
monk
bahira
in
the
convent
at
bozrah
mohammed
was
taught
the
tenets
of
the
nestorians
from
them
the
young
arab
learned
the
story
of
their
persecutions
it
was
these
interviews
which
engendered
in
him
a
hatred
of
the
idolatrous
practices
of
the
eastern
church
and
indeed
of
all
idolatry
that
taught
him
in
his
wonderful
career
never
to
speak
of
jesus
as
the
son
of
god
but
always
as
jesus
the
son
of
mary
his
untutored
but
active
mind
could
not
fail
to
be
profoundly
impressed
not
only
with
the
religious
but
also
with
the
philosophical
ideas
of
his
instructors
who
gloried
in
being
the
living
representatives
of
aristotelian
science
his
subsequent
career
shows
how
completely
their
religious
thoughts
had
taken
possession
of
him
and
repeated
acts
manifest
his
affectionate
regard
for
them
his
own
life
was
devoted
to
the
expansion
and
extension
of
their
theological
doctrine
and
that
once
effectually
established
his
successors
energetically
adopted
and
diffused
their
scientific
their
aristotelian
opinions
as
mohammed
grew
to
manhood
he
made
other
expeditions
to
syria
perhaps
we
may
suppose
that
on
these
occasions
the
convent
and
its
hospitable
in
mates
were
not
forgotten
he
had
a
mysterious
reverence
for
that
country
a
wealthy
meccan
widow
chadizah
had
intrusted
him
with
the
care
of
her
syrian
trade
she
was
charmed
with
his
capacity
and
fidelity
and
since
he
is
said
to
have
been
characterized
by
the
possession
of
singular
manly
beauty
and
a
most
courteous
demeanor
charmed
with
his
person
the
female
heart
in
all
ages
and
countries
is
the
same
she
caused
a
slave
to
intimate
to
him
what
was
passing
in
her
mind
and
for
the
remaining
years
of
her
life
mohammed
was
her
faithful
husband
in
a
land
of
polygamy
he
never
insulted
her
by
the
presence
of
a
rival
many
years
subsequently
in
the
height
of
his
power
ayesha
who
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
women
in
arabia
said
to
him
was
she
not
old
did
not
god
give
you
in
me
a
better
wife
in
her
place
no
by
god
exclaimed
mohammed
and
with
a
burst
of
honest
gratitude
there
never
can
be
a
better
she
believed
in
me
when
men
despised
me
she
relieved
me
when
i
was
poor
and
persecuted
by
the
world
his
marriage
with
chadizah
placed
him
in
circumstances
of
ease
and
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
indulging
his
inclination
to
religious
meditation
it
so
happened
that
her
cousin
waraka
who
was
a
jew
had
turned
christian
he
was
the
first
to
translate
the
bible
into
arabic
by
his
conversation
mohammed
detestation
of
idolatry
was
confirmed
after
the
example
of
the
christian
anchorites
in
their
hermitages
in
the
desert
mohammed
retired
to
a
grotto
in
mount
hera
a
few
miles
from
mecca
giving
himself
up
to
meditation
and
prayer
in
this
seclusion
contemplating
the
awful
attributes
of
the
omnipotent
and
eternal
god
he
addressed
to
his
conscience
the
solemn
inquiry
whether
he
could
adopt
the
dogmas
then
held
in
asiatic
christendom
respecting
the
trinity
the
sonship
of
jesus
as
begotten
by
the
almighty
the
character
of
mary
as
at
once
a
virgin
a
mother
and
the
queen
of
heaven
without
incurring
the
guilt
and
the
peril
of
blasphemy
by
his
solitary
meditations
in
the
grotto
mohammed
was
drawn
to
the
conclusion
that
through
the
cloud
of
dogmas
and
disputations
around
him
one
great
truth
might
be
discerned
the
unity
of
god
leaning
against
the
stem
of
a
he
unfolded
his
views
on
this
subject
to
his
neighbors
and
friends
and
announced
to
them
that
he
should
dedicate
his
life
to
the
preaching
of
that
truth
again
and
again
in
his
sermons
and
in
the
koran
he
declared
i
am
nothing
but
a
public
preacher
i
preach
the
oneness
of
god
such
was
his
own
conception
of
his
apostleship
henceforth
to
the
day
of
his
death
he
wore
on
his
finger
a
on
which
was
engraved
mohammed
the
messenger
of
god
victories
of
mohammed
it
is
well
known
among
physicians
that
prolonged
fasting
and
mental
anxiety
inevitably
give
rise
to
hallucination
perhaps
there
never
has
been
any
religious
system
introduced
by
earnest
men
that
did
not
offer
examples
of
supernatural
temptations
and
supernatural
commands
mysterious
voices
encouraged
the
arabian
preacher
to
persist
in
his
determination
shadows
of
strange
forms
passed
before
him
he
heard
sounds
in
the
air
like
those
of
a
distant
bell
in
a
nocturnal
dream
he
was
carried
by
gabriel
from
mecca
to
jerusalem
and
thence
in
succession
through
the
six
heavens
into
the
seventh
the
angel
feared
to
intrude
and
mohammed
alone
passed
into
the
dread
cloud
that
forever
enshrouds
the
almighty
a
shiver
thrilled
his
heart
as
he
felt
upon
his
shoulder
the
touch
of
the
cold
hand
of
god
his
public
ministrations
met
with
much
resistance
and
little
success
at
first
expelled
from
mecca
by
the
upholders
of
the
prevalent
idolatry
he
sought
refuge
in
medina
a
town
in
which
there
were
many
jews
and
nestorians
the
latter
at
once
became
proselytes
to
his
faith
he
had
already
been
compelled
to
send
his
daughter
and
others
of
his
disciples
to
abyssinia
the
king
of
which
was
a
nestorian
christian
at
the
end
of
six
years
he
had
made
only
fifteen
hundred
converts
but
in
three
little
skirmishes
magnified
in
subsequent
times
by
the
designation
of
the
battles
of
beder
of
ohud
and
of
the
nations
mohammed
discovered
that
his
most
convincing
argument
was
his
sword
afterward
with
oriental
eloquence
he
said
paradise
will
be
found
in
the
shadow
of
the
crossing
of
swords
by
a
series
of
military
operations
his
enemies
were
completely
overthrown
arabian
idolatry
was
absolutely
exterminated
the
doctrine
he
proclaimed
that
there
is
but
one
god
was
universally
adopted
by
his
countrymen
and
his
own
apostleship
accepted
death
of
mohammed
let
us
pass
over
his
stormy
life
and
hear
what
he
says
when
on
the
pinnacle
of
earthly
power
and
glory
he
was
approaching
its
close
steadfast
in
his
declaration
of
the
unity
of
god
he
departed
from
medina
on
his
last
pilgrimage
to
mecca
at
the
head
of
one
hundred
and
fourteen
thousand
devotees
with
camels
decorated
with
garlands
of
flowers
and
fluttering
streamers
when
he
approached
the
holy
city
he
uttered
the
solemn
invocation
here
am
i
in
thy
service
o
god
thou
hast
no
companion
to
thee
alone
belongeth
worship
thine
alone
is
the
kingdom
there
is
none
to
share
it
with
thee
with
his
own
hand
he
offered
up
the
camels
in
sacrifice
he
considered
that
primeval
institution
to
be
equally
sacred
as
prayer
and
that
no
reason
can
be
alleged
in
support
of
the
one
which
is
not
equally
strong
in
support
of
the
other
from
the
pulpit
of
the
caaba
he
reiterated
o
my
hearers
i
am
only
a
man
like
yourselves
they
remembered
that
he
had
once
said
to
one
who
approached
him
with
timid
steps
of
what
dost
thou
stand
in
awe
i
am
no
king
i
am
nothing
but
the
son
of
an
arab
woman
who
ate
flesh
dried
in
the
sun
he
returned
to
medina
to
die
in
his
farewell
to
his
congregation
he
said
every
thing
happens
according
to
the
will
of
god
and
has
its
appointed
time
which
can
neither
be
hastened
nor
avoided
i
return
to
him
who
sent
me
and
my
last
command
to
you
is
that
ye
love
honor
and
uphold
each
other
that
ye
exhort
each
other
to
faith
and
constancy
in
belief
and
to
the
performance
of
pious
deeds
my
life
has
been
for
your
good
and
so
will
be
my
death
in
his
dying
agony
his
head
was
reclined
on
the
lap
of
ayesha
from
time
to
time
he
had
dipped
his
hand
in
a
vase
of
water
and
moistened
his
face
at
last
he
ceased
and
gazing
steadfastly
upward
said
in
broken
accents
o
god
forgive
my
sins
be
it
so
i
come
shall
we
speak
of
this
man
with
disrespect
his
precepts
are
at
this
day
the
religious
guide
of
of
the
human
race
doctrines
of
mohammed
in
mohammed
who
had
already
broken
away
from
the
ancient
idolatrous
worship
of
his
native
country
preparation
had
been
made
for
the
rejection
of
those
tenets
which
his
nestorian
teachers
had
communicated
to
him
inconsistent
with
reason
and
conscience
and
though
in
the
first
pages
of
the
koran
he
declares
his
belief
in
what
was
delivered
to
moses
and
jesus
and
his
reverence
for
them
personally
his
veneration
for
the
almighty
is
perpetually
displayed
he
is
at
the
doctrine
of
the
divinity
of
jesus
the
worship
of
mary
as
the
mother
of
god
the
adoration
of
images
and
paintings
in
his
eyes
a
base
idolatry
he
absolutely
rejects
the
trinity
of
which
he
seems
to
have
entertained
the
idea
that
it
could
not
be
interpreted
otherwise
than
as
presenting
three
distinct
gods
his
first
and
ruling
idea
was
simply
religious
reform
to
overthrow
arabian
idolatry
and
put
an
end
to
the
wild
sectarianism
of
christianity
that
he
proposed
to
set
up
a
new
religion
was
a
calumny
invented
against
him
in
constantinople
where
he
was
looked
upon
with
detestation
like
that
with
which
in
after
ages
luther
was
regarded
in
rome
but
though
he
rejected
with
indignation
whatever
might
seem
to
disparage
the
doctrine
of
the
unity
of
god
he
was
not
able
to
emancipate
himself
from
anthropomorphic
conceptions
the
god
of
the
koran
is
altogether
human
both
corporeally
and
mentally
if
such
expressions
may
with
propriety
be
used
very
soon
however
the
followers
of
mohammed
divested
themselves
of
these
base
ideas
and
rose
to
nobler
ones
the
view
here
presented
of
the
primitive
character
of
mohammedanism
has
long
been
adopted
by
many
competent
authorities
sir
william
jones
following
locke
regards
the
main
point
in
the
divergence
of
mohammedanism
from
christianity
to
consist
in
denying
vehemently
the
character
of
our
savior
as
the
son
and
his
equality
as
god
with
the
father
of
whose
unity
and
attributes
the
mohammedans
entertain
and
express
the
most
awful
ideas
this
opinion
has
been
largely
entertained
in
italy
dante
regarded
mohammed
only
as
the
author
of
a
schism
and
saw
in
islamism
only
an
arian
sect
in
england
whately
views
it
as
a
corruption
of
christianity
it
was
an
offshoot
of
nestorianism
and
not
until
it
had
overthrown
greek
christianity
in
many
great
battles
was
spreading
rapidly
over
asia
and
africa
and
had
become
intoxicated
with
its
wonderful
successes
did
it
repudiate
its
primitive
limited
intentions
and
assert
itself
to
be
founded
on
a
separate
and
distinct
revelation
the
first
khalif
mohammed
life
had
been
almost
entirely
consumed
in
the
conversion
or
conquest
of
his
native
country
toward
its
close
however
he
felt
himself
strong
enough
to
threaten
the
invasion
of
syria
and
persia
he
had
made
no
provision
for
the
perpetuation
of
his
own
dominion
and
hence
it
was
not
without
a
struggle
that
a
successor
was
appointed
at
length
abubeker
the
father
of
ayesha
was
selected
he
was
proclaimed
the
first
khalif
or
successor
of
the
prophet
there
is
a
very
important
difference
between
the
spread
of
mohammedanism
and
the
spread
of
christianity
the
latter
was
never
sufficiently
strong
to
over
throw
and
extirpate
idolatry
in
the
roman
empire
as
it
advanced
there
was
an
amalgamation
a
union
the
old
forms
of
the
one
were
vivified
by
the
new
spirit
of
the
other
and
that
paganization
to
which
reference
has
already
been
made
was
the
result
the
mohammedan
heaven
but
in
arabia
mohammed
overthrew
and
absolutely
annihilated
the
old
idolatry
no
trace
of
it
is
found
in
the
doctrines
preached
by
him
and
his
successors
the
black
stone
that
had
fallen
from
heaven
the
meteorite
of
the
caaba
and
its
encircling
idols
passed
totally
out
of
view
the
essential
dogma
of
the
new
faith
there
is
but
one
god
spread
without
any
adulteration
military
successes
had
in
a
worldly
sense
made
the
religion
of
the
koran
profitable
and
no
matter
what
dogmas
may
be
when
that
is
the
case
there
will
be
plenty
of
converts
as
to
the
popular
doctrines
of
mohammedanism
i
shall
here
have
nothing
to
say
the
reader
who
is
interested
in
that
matter
will
find
an
account
of
them
in
a
review
of
the
koran
in
the
eleventh
chapter
of
my
history
of
the
intellectual
development
of
europe
it
is
enough
now
to
remark
that
their
heaven
was
arranged
in
seven
stories
and
was
only
a
palace
of
oriental
carnal
delight
it
was
filled
with
concubines
and
servants
the
form
of
god
was
perhaps
more
awful
than
that
of
paganized
christianity
anthropomorphism
will
however
never
be
obliterated
from
the
ideas
of
the
unintellectual
their
god
at
the
best
will
never
be
any
thing
more
than
the
gigantic
shadow
of
a
man
a
vast
phantom
of
humanity
like
one
of
those
alpine
spectres
seen
in
the
midst
of
the
clouds
by
him
who
turns
his
back
on
the
sun
abubeker
had
scarcely
seated
himself
in
the
khalifate
when
he
put
forth
the
following
proclamation
in
the
name
of
the
most
merciful
god
abubeker
to
the
rest
of
the
true
believers
health
and
happiness

and
blessing
of
god

you

this
is
to
inform
you
that
i
intend
to
send
the
true
believers
into
syria
to
take
it
out
of
the
hands
of
the
infidels
and
i
would
have
you
know
that
the
fighting
for
religion
is
an
act
of
obedience
to
god
on
the
first
encounter
khaled
the
saracen
general
hard
pressed
lifted
up
his
hands
in
the

of
his
army
and
said
o
god
these
vile
wretches
pray
with
idolatrous
expressions
and
take
to
themselves
another
god
besides
thee
but
we
acknowledge
thy
unity
and
affirm
that
there
is
no
other
god
but
thee
alone
help
us
we
beseech
thee
for
the
sake
of
thy
prophet
mohammed
against
these
idolaters
on
the
part
of
the
saracens
the
conquest
of
syria
was
conducted
with
ferocious
piety
the
belief
of
the
syrian
christians
aroused
in
their
antagonists
sentiments
of
horror
and
indignation
i
will
cleave
the

blaspheming

because
they
joined
mary

it

was
devolved
on
abou

in

on
his
troops
justice

the
observance

fidelity
in

engagements
he
commanded
them
to
abstain
from

from

rigorously
to
observe
the
hours

a
strong
town
where
mohammed
had
first
met
his

christian
instructors
it
was
one
of
the
roman
forts
with
which
the
country
was
dotted
over
before
this
place
the
saracen
army
encamped
the
garrison
was
strong
the
ramparts
were
covered
with
holy
crosses
and
consecrated
banners
it
might
have
made
a
long
defense
but
its
governor
romanus
betrayed
his
trust
and
stealthily
opened
its
gates
to
the
besiegers
his
conduct
shows
to
what
a
deplorable
condition
the
population
of
syria
had
come
after
the
surrender
in
a
speech
he
made
to
the
people
he
had
betrayed
he
said
i
renounce
your
society
both
in
this
world

that

was
sent
to
lead
us
in
the
right
way
and
to
exalt
the
true
religion
in
spite
of
those
who
join
partners
with
god
since
the
persian
invasion
asia
minor
syria
and
even
palestine
were
full
of
traitors
and
apostates
ready
to
join
the
saracens
romanus
was
but
one
of
many
thousands
who
had
fallen
into
disbelief
through
the
victories
of
the
persians
fall
of
damascus
from
bozrah
it
was
only
seventy
miles
northward
to
damascus
the
capital
of
syria
thither
without
delay
the
saracen
army
marched
the
city

at

summoned
to
take

option

or
the

in
his
palace
at

barely
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
still
farther
north
the
emperor
heraclius
received
tidings
of
the
alarming
advance
of
his
assailants
he
at
once
dispatched
an
army
of
seventy
thousand
men
the
saracens
were
compelled
to
raise

a
battle
took
place
in
the
plains
of

the
roman
army
was
overthrown
and
dispersed
khaled
reappeared
before
damascus
with
his
standard
of
the
black
eagle
and
after
a
renewed
investment
of
seventy
days
damascus
surrendered
from
the
arabian
historians
of
these
events
we
may
gather
that
thus
far
the
saracen
armies
were
little
better
than
a
fanatic
mob
many
of
the
men
fought
naked
it
was
not
unusual
for
a
warrior
to
stand
forth
in
front
and
challenge
an
antagonist
to
mortal
duel
nay
more
even
the
women
engaged
in
the
combats
picturesque
narratives

been
handed
down
to

gallant
manner
in
which
they

the

guided
by

way
baalbec

valley
and
emesa
the
chief
city

the
eastern
plain
to
resist
its

heraclius
collected
an
army
of
one
hundred
and
forty
thousand
men
a
battle
took
place
at
yermuck
the
right
wing
of
the
saracens
was
broken
but
the
soldiers
were
driven
back
to
the
field
by
the
fanatic
expostulations
of
their
women
the
conflict
ended
in
the
complete
overthrow
of
the
roman
army
forty
thousand
were
taken
prisoners
and
a
vast
number
killed
the
whole
country
now
lay
open
to
the
victors
the
advance
of
their
army
had
been
east
of
the
jordan
it
was
clear
that
before
asia
minor
could
be
touched
the
strong
and
important
cities
of
palestine
which
was
now
in
their
rear
must
be
secured
there
was
a
difference
of
opinion
among
the
generals
in
the
field
as
to
whether
caesarea
or
jerusalem
should
be
assailed
first
the
matter
was
referred
to
the
khalif
who
rightly
preferring
the
moral
advantages
of
the
capture
of
jerusalem
to
the
military
advantages
of
the
capture
of
caesarea
ordered
the
holy
city
to
be
taken
and
that
at
any
cost
close
siege
was
therefore
laid
to
it
the
inhabitants
remembering
the
atrocities
inflicted
by
the
persians
and
the
indignities
that
had
been
offered
to
the
savior
sepulchre
prepared
now
for
a
vigorous
defense
but
after
an
investment
of
four
months
the
patriarch
sophronius
appeared
on
the
wall
asking
terms
of
capitulation
there
had
been
misunderstandings
among
the
generals
at
the
capture
of
damascus
followed
by
a
massacre
of
the
fleeing
inhabitants
sophronius
therefore
stipulated
that
the
surrender
of
jerusalem
should
take
place
in
presence
of
the
khalif
himself
accordingly
omar
the
khalif
came
from
medina
for
that
purpose
he
journeyed
on
a
red
camel
carrying
a
bag
of
corn
and
one
of
dates
a
wooden
dish
and
a
leathern
the
arab
conqueror
entered
the
holy
city
riding
by
the
side
of
the
christian
patriarch
and
the
transference
of
the
capital
of
christianity
to
the
representative
of
mohammedanism
was
effected
without
tumult
or
outrage
having
ordered
that
a
mosque
should
be
built
on
the
site
of
the
temple
of
solomon
the
khalif
returned
to
the
tomb
of
the
prophet
at
medina
heraclius
saw
plainly
that
the
disasters
which
were
fast
settling
on
christianity
were
due
to
the
dissensions
of
its
conflicting
sects
and
hence
while
he
endeavored
to
defend
the
empire
with
his
armies
he
sedulously
tried
to
compose
those
differences
with
this
view
he
pressed
for
acceptance
the
monothelite
doctrine
of
the
nature
of
christ
but
it
was
now
too
late
aleppo
and
antioch
were
taken
nothing
could
prevent
the
saracens
from
overrunning
asia
minor
heraclius
himself
had
to
seek
safety
in
flight

had
been
added

pompey

hundred
years
previously

the
birthplace
of

the
scene
of
its
most
sacred
and
precious
souvenirs
the
land
from
which
heraclius
himself
had
once
expelled
the
persian
intruder
was
irretrievably
lost
apostates
and
traitors
had
wrought
this
calamity
we
are
told
that
as
the
ship
which
bore
him
to
constantinople
parted
from
the
shore
heraclius
gazed
intently
on
the
receding
hills
and
in
the
bitterness
of
anguish
exclaimed
farewell
syria
forever
farewell
it
is
needless
to
dwell
on
the
remaining
details
of
the
saracen
conquest
how
tripoli
and
tyre
were
betrayed
how
caesarea
was
captured
how
with
the
trees
of
libanus
and
the
sailors
of
phoenicia
a
saracen
fleet
was
equipped
which
drove
the
roman
navy
into
the
hellespont
how
cyprus
rhodes
and
the
cyclades
were
ravaged
and
the
colossus
which
was
counted
as
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
world
sold
to
a
jew
who
loaded
nine
hundred
camels
with
its
brass
how
the
armies
of
the
khalif
advanced
to
the
black
sea
and
even
lay
in
front
of
constantinople
all
this
was
as
nothing
after
the
fall
of
jerusalem
overthrow
of
the
persians
the
fall
of
jerusalem
the
loss
of
the
metropolis
of
christianity
in
the
ideas
of
that
age
the
two
antagonistic
forms
of
faith
had
submitted
themselves
to
the
ordeal
of
the
judgment
of
god
victory
had
awarded
the
prize
of
battle
jerusalem
to
the
mohammedan
and
notwithstanding
the
temporary
successes
of
the
crusaders
after
much
more
than
a
thousand
years
in
his
hands
it
remains
to
this
day
the
byzantine
historians
are
not
without
excuse
for
the
course
they
are
condemned
for
taking
they
have
wholly
neglected
the
great
topic
of
the
ruin
of
the
eastern
church
and
as
for
the
western
church
even
the
debased
popes
of
the
middle
ages
the
ages
of
the
crusades
could
not
see
without
indignation
that
they
were
compelled
to
rest
the
claims
of
rome
as
the
metropolis
of
christendom
on
a
false
legendary
story
of
a
visit
of
peter
to
that
city
while
the
true
metropolis
the
grand
the
sacred
place
of
the
birth
the
life
the
death
of
christ
himself
was
in
the
hands
of
the
infidels
it
has
not
been
the
byzantine
historians
alone
who
have
tried
to
conceal
this
great
catastrophe
the
christian
writers
of
europe
on
all
manner
of
subjects
whether
of
history
religion
or
science
have
followed
a
similar
course
against
their
conquering
antagonists
it
has
been
their
constant
practice
to
hide
what
they
could
not
depreciate
and

what
they

invasion
of
egypt
i
have
not
space
nor
indeed
does
it
comport
with
the
intention
of
this
work
to
relate
in
such
detail
as
i
have
given
to
the
fall
of
jerusalem
other
conquests
of
the
saracens
conquests
which
eventually
established
a
mohammedan
empire
far
exceeding
in
geographical
extent
that
of
alexander
and
even
that
of
rome
but
devoting
a
few
words
to
this
subject
it
may
be
said
that
magianism
received
a
worse
blow
than
that
which
had
been
inflicted
on
christianity
the
fate
of
persia
was
settled
at
the
battle
of
cadesia
at
the
sack
of
ctesiphon
the
treasury
the
royal
arms
and
an
unlimited
spoil
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
saracens
not
without
reason
do
they
call
the
battle
of
nehavend
the
victory
of
victories
in
one
direction
they
advanced
to
the
caspian
in
the
other
southward
along
the
tigris
to
persepolis
the
persian
king
fled
for
his
life
over
the
great
salt
desert
from
the
columns
and
statues
of
that
city
which
had
lain
in
ruins
since
the
night
of
the
riotous
banquet
of
alexander
one
division
of
the
arabian
army
forced
the
persian
monarch
over
the
oxus
he
was
assassinated
by
the
turks
his
son
was
driven
into
china
and
became
a
captain
in
the
chinese
emperor
guards
the
country
beyond
the
oxus
was
reduced
it
paid
a
tribute
of
two
million
pieces
of
gold
while
the
emperor
at
peking
was
demanding
the
friendship
of
the
khalif
at
medina
the
standard
of
the
prophet
was
displayed
on
the
banks
of
the
indus
among
the
generals
who
had
greatly
distinguished
themselves
in
the
syrian
wars
was
amrou
destined
to
be
the
conqueror
of
egypt
for
the
khalifs
not
content
with
their
victories
on
the
north
and
east
now
turned
their
eyes
to
the
west
and
prepared
for
the
annexation
of
africa
as
in
the
former
cases
so
in
this
sectarian
treason
assisted
them
the
saracen
army
was
hailed
as
the
deliverer
of
the
jacobite
church
the
monophysite
christians
of
egypt
that
is
they
who
in
the
language
of
the
athanasian
creed
confounded
the
substance
of
the
son
proclaimed
through
their
leader
mokaukas
that
they
desired
no
communion
with
the
greeks
either
in
this
world
or
the
next
that
they
abjured
forever
the
byzantine
tyrant
and
his
synod
of
chalcedon
they
hastened
to
pay
tribute
to
the
khalif
to
repair
the
roads
and
bridges
and
to
supply
provisions
and
intelligence
to
the
invading
army
fall
of
alexandria
memphis
one
of
the
old
pharaonic
capitals
soon
fell
and
alexandria
was
invested
the
open
sea
behind
gave
opportunity
to
heraclius
to
reenforce
the
garrison
continually
on
his
part
omar
who
was
now
khalif
sent
to
the
succor
of
the
besieging
army
the
veteran
troops
of
syria
there
were
many
assaults
and
many
sallies
in
one
amrou
himself
was
taken
prisoner
by
the
besieged
but
through
the
dexterity
of
a
slave
made
his
escape
after
a
siege
of
fourteen
months
and
a
loss
of
thousand
men
the
saracens
captured
the
city
in
his
dispatch
to
the
khalif
amrou
enumerated
the
splendors
of
the
great
city
of
the
west
its
four
thousand
palaces
four
thousand
baths
four
hundred
theatres
twelve
thousand
shops
for
the
sale
of
vegetable
food
and
forty
thousand
tributary
jews
so
fell
the
second
great
city
of
christendom
the
fate
of
jerusalem
had
fallen
on
alexandria
the
city
of
athanasius
and
arius
and
cyril
the
city
that
had
imposed
trinitarian
ideas
and
mariolatry
on
the
church
in
his
palace
at
constantinople
heraclius
received
the
fatal
tidings
he
was
overwhelmed
with
grief
it
seemed
as
if
his
reign
was
to
be
disgraced
by
the
downfall
of
christianity
he
lived
scarcely
a
month
after
the
loss
of
the
town
but
if
alexandria
had
been
essential
to
constantinople
in
the
supply
of
orthodox
faith
she
was
also
essential
in
the
supply
of
daily
food
egypt
was
the
granary
of
the
byzantines
for
this
reason
two
attempts
were
made
by
powerful
fleets
and
armies
for
the
recovery
of
the
place
and
twice
had
amrou
to
renew
his
conquest
he
saw
with
what
facility
these
attacks
could
be
made
the
place
being
open
to
the
sea
he
saw
that
there
was
but
one
and
that
a
fatal
remedy
by
the
living
god
if
this
thing
be
repeated
a
third
time
i
will
make
alexandria
as
open
to
anybody
as
is
the
house
of
a
prostitute
he
was
better
than
his
word
for
he
forthwith
dismantled
its
fortifications
and
made
it
an
untenable
place
fall
of
carthage
it
was
not
the
intention
of
the
khalifs
to
limit
their
conquest
to
egypt
othman
contemplated
the
annexation
of
the
entire
coast
his
general
abdallah
set
out
from
memphis
with
forty
thousand
men
passed
through
the
desert
of
barca
and
besieged
tripoli
but
the
plague
breaking
out
in
his
army
he
was
compelled
to
retreat
to
egypt
all
attempts
were
now
suspended
for
more
than
twenty
years
then
akbah
forced
his
way
from
the
nile
to
the
atlantic
ocean
in
front
of
the
canary
islands
he
rode
his
horse
into
the
sea
exclaiming
great
god
if
my
course
were
not
stopped
by
this
sea
i
would
still
go
on
to
the
unknown
kingdoms
of
the
west
preaching
the
unity
of
thy
holy
name
and
putting
to
the
sword
the
rebellious
nations
who
worship
any
other
gods
than
thee
these
saracen
expeditions
had
been
through
the
interior
of
the
country
for
the
byzantine
emperors
controlling
for
the
time
the
mediterranean
had
retained
possession
of
the
cities
on
the
coast
the
khalif
abdalmalek
at
length
resolved
on
the
reduction
of
carthage
the
most
important
of
those
cities
and
indeed
the
capital
of
north
africa
his
general
hassan
carried
it
by
escalade
but
reenforcements
from
constantinople
aided
by
some
sicilian
and
gothic
troops
compelled
him
to
retreat
the
relief
was
however
only
temporary
hassan
in
the
course
of
a
few
months
renewed
his
attack
it
proved
successful
and
he
delivered
carthage
to
the
flames
jerusalem
alexandria
carthage
three
out
of
the
five
great
christian
capitals
were
lost
the
fall
of
constantinople
was
only
a
question
of
time
after
its
fall
rome
alone
remained
in
the
development
of
christianity
carthage
had
played
no
insignificant
part
it
had
given
to
europe
its
latin
form
of
faith
and
some
of
its
greatest
theologians
it
was
the
home
of
augustine
never
in
the
history
of
the
world
had
there
been
so
rapid
and
extensive
a
propagation
of
any
religion
as
mohammedanism
it
was
now

lead
in
the
very
crisis
of
the
battle
of
xeres
a
large
portion
of
the

went
over
to
the
invaders
the
spanish
king
was
compelled
to
flee
from
the
field
and
in
the
pursuit
he
was
drowned
in
the
waters
of
the
guadalquivir
with
great
rapidity
tarik
the
lieutenant
of
musa
pushed
forward
from
the
to
toledo
and
thence
northward
on
the
arrival
of
musa
the
reduction
of
the
spanish
peninsula
was
completed
and
the
wreck
of
the
gothic
army
driven
beyond
the
pyrenees
into
france
considering
the
conquest
of
spain
as
only
the
first
step
in
his
victories
he
announced
his
intention
of
forcing
his
way
into
italy
and
preaching
the
unity
of
god
in
the
vatican
thence
he
would
march
to
constantinople
and
having
put
all
end
to
the
roman
empire
and
christianity
would
pass
into
asia
and
lay
his
victorious
sword
on
the
footstool
of
the
khalif
at
damascus
but
this
was
not
to
be
musa
envious
of
his
lieutenant
tarik
had
treated
him
with
great
indignity
the
friends
of
tarik
at
the
court
of
the
khalif
found
means
of
retaliation
an
envoy
from
damascus
arrested
musa
in
his
camp
he
was
carried
before
his
sovereign
disgraced
by
a
public
whipping
and
died
of
a
broken
heart
invasion
of
france
under
other
leaders
however
the
saracen
conquest
of
france
was
attempted
in
a
preliminary
campaign
the
country
from
the
mouth
of
the
garonne
to
that
of
the
loire
was
secured
then
abderahman
the
saracen
commander
dividing
his
forces
into
two
columns
with
one
on
the
east
passed
the
rhone
and
laid
siege
to
arles
a
christian
army
attempting
the
relief
of
the
place
was
defeated
with
heavy
loss
his
western
column
equally
successful
passed
the
dordogne
defeated
another
christian
army
inflicting
on
it
such
dreadful
loss
that
according
to
its
own
fugitives
god
alone
could
number
the
slain
all
central
france
was
now
overrun
the
banks
of
the
loire
were
reached
the
churches
and
monasteries
were
despoiled
of
their
treasures
and
the
tutelar
saints
who
had
worked
so
many
miracles
when
there
was
no
necessity
were
found
to
want
the
requisite
power
when
it
was
so
greatly
needed
the
progress
of
the
invaders
was
at
length
stopped
by
charles
martel
between
tours
and
poictiers
a
great
battle
which
lasted
seven
days
was
fought
abderahman
was
killed
the
saracens
retreated
and
soon
afterward
were
compelled
to
recross
the
pyrenees
the
banks
of
the
loire
therefore
mark
the
boundary
of
the
mohammedan
advance
in
western
europe
gibbon
in
his
narrative
of
these
great
events
makes
this
remark
a
victorious
line
of
march
had
been
prolonged
above
a
thousand
miles
from
the
rock
of
gibraltar
to
the
banks
of
the
loire
a
repetition
of
an
equal
space
would
have
carried
the
saracens
to
the
confines
of
poland
and
the
highlands
of
scotland
insult
to
rome
it
is
not
necessary
for
me
to
add
to
this
sketch
of
the
military
diffusion
of
mohammedanism
the
operations
of
the
saracens
on
the
mediterranean
sea
their
conquest
of
crete
and
sicily
their
insult
to
rome
it
will
be
found
however
that
their
presence
in
sicily
and
the
south
of
italy
exerted
a
marked
influence
on
the
intellectual
development
of
europe
their
insult
to
rome
what
could
be
more
humiliating
than
the
circumstances
under
which
it
took
place
an
insignificant
saracen
expedition
entered
the
tiber
and
appeared
before
the
walls
of
the
city
too
weak
to
force
an
entrance
it
insulted
and
plundered
the
precincts
sacrilegiously
violating
the
tombs
of
peter
and
paul
had
the
city
itself
been
sacked
the
moral
effect
could
not
have
been
greater
from
the
church
of
peter
its
altar
of
silver
was
torn
away
and
sent
to
africa
peter
altar
the
very
emblem
of
roman
christianity
constantinople
had
already
been
besieged
by
the
saracens
more
than
once
its
fall
was
predestined
and
only
postponed
rome
had
received
the
direst
insult
the
greatest
loss
that
could
be
inflicted
upon
it
the
venerable
churches
of
asia
minor
had
passed
out
of
existence
no
christian
could
set
his
foot
in
jerusalem
without
permission
the
mosque
of
omar
stood
on
the
site
of
the
temple
of
solomon
among
the
ruins
of
alexandria
the
mosque
of
mercy
marked
the
spot
where
a
saracen
general
satiated
with
massacre
had
in
contemptuous
compassion
spared
the
fugitive
relics
of
the
enemies
of
mohammed
nothing
remained
of
carthage
but
her
blackened
ruins
the
most
powerful
religious
empire
that
the
world
had
ever
seen
had
suddenly
come
into
existence
it
stretched
from
the
atlantic
ocean
to
the
chinese
wall
from
the
shores
of
the
caspian
to
those
of
the
indian
ocean
and
yet
in
one
sense
it
had
not
reached
its
culmination
the
day
was
to
come
when
it
was
to
expel
the
successors
of
the
caesars
from
their
capital
and
hold
the
peninsula
of
greece
in
subjection
to
dispute
with
christianity
the
empire
of
europe
in
the
very
centre
of
that
continent
and
in
africa
to
extend
its
dogmas
and
faith
across
burning
deserts
and
through
pestilential
forests
from
the
mediterranean
to
regions
southward
far
beyond
the
equinoctial
line
dissensions
of
the
arabs
but
though
mohammedanism
had
not
reached
its
culmination
the
dominion
of
the
khalifs
had
not
the
sword
of
charles
martel
but
the
internal
dissension
of
the
vast
arabian
empire
was
the
salvation
of
europe
though
the
ommiade
khalifs
were
popular
in
syria
elsewhere
they
were
looked
upon
as
intruders
or
usurpers
the
kindred
of
the
apostle
was
considered
to
be
the
rightful
representative
of
his
faith
three
parties
distinguished
by
their
colors
tore
the
khalifate
asunder
with
their
disputes
and
disgraced
it
by
their
atrocities
the
color
of
the
ommiades
was
white
that
of
the
fatimites
green
that
of
the
abassides
black
the
last
represented
the
party
of
abbas
the
uncle
of
mohammed
the
result
of
these
discords
was
a
tripartite
division
of
the
mohammedan
empire
in
the
tenth
century
into
the
khalifates
of
bagdad
of
cairoan
and
of
cordova
unity
in
mohammedan
political
action
was
at
an
end
and
christendom
found
its
safeguard
not
in
supernatural
help
but
in
the
quarrels
of
the
rival
potentates
to
internal
animosities
foreign
pressures
were
eventually
added
and
arabism
which
had
done
so
much
for
the
intellectual
advancement
of
the
world
came
to
an
end
when
the
turks
and
the
berbers
attained
to
power
the
saracens
had
become
totally
regardless
of
european
opposition
they
were
wholly
taken
up
with
their
domestic
quarrels
ockley
says
with
truth
in
his
history
the
saracens
had
scarce
a
deputy
lieutenant
or
general
that
would
not
have
thought
it
the
greatest
affront
and
such
as
ought
to
stigmatize
him
with
indelible
disgrace
if
he
should
have
suffered
himself
to
have
been
insulted
by
the
united
forces
of
all
europe
and
if
any
one
asks
why
the
greeks
did
not
exert
themselves
more
in
order
to
the
extirpation
of
these
insolent
invaders
it
is
a
sufficient
answer
to
any
person
that
is
acquainted
with
the
characters
of
those
men
to
say
that
amrou
kept
his
residence
at
alexandria
and
moawyah
at
damascus
as
to
their
contempt
this
instance
may
suffice
nicephorus
the
roman
emperor
had
sent
to
the
khalif
a
threatening
letter
and
this
was
the
reply
in
the
name
of
the
most
merciful
god
commander
of
the
faithful
to
nicephorus
the
roman
dog
i
have
read
thy
letter
o
thou
son
of
an
unbelieving
mother
thou
shalt
not
hear
thou
shalt
behold
my
reply
it
was
written
in
letters
of
blood
and
fire
on
the
plains
of
phrygia
political
effect
of

a

may
recover
the
confiscation
of
its
provinces
the
confiscation
of
its
wealth
it
may
survive
the
imposition
of
enormous

it
never
can
recover
from
that
most
frightful
of
all
the
confiscation
of
its

upbraided
him
that
he
had
not
let
the
troops
have
the
women
if
they
want
to
marry
in
syria
let
them
and
let
them
have
as
many
female

as
they
have
occasion
for
it
was
the
institution
of
polygamy
based
upon
the
confiscation
of
the
women
in
the
vanquished
countries
that
secured
forever
the
mohammedan
rule
the
children
of
these
unions
gloried
in
their
descent
from
their
conquering
fathers
no
better
proof
can
be
given
of
the
efficacy
of
this
policy
than
that
which
is
furnished
by
north
africa
the
irresistible
effect
of
polygamy
in
consolidating
the
new
order
of
things
was
very
striking
in
little
more
than
a
single
generation
the
khalif
was
informed
by
his
officers
that
the
tribute
must
cease
for
all
the
children
born
in
that
region
were
mohammedans
and
all
spoke
arabic
mohammedanism
mohammedanism
as
left
by
its
founder
was
an
anthropomorphic
religion
its
god
was
only
a
gigantic
man
its
heaven
a
mansion
of
carnal
pleasures
from
these
imperfect
ideas
its
more
intelligent
classes
very
soon
freed
themselves
substituting
for
them
others
more
philosophical
more
correct
eventually
they
attained
to
an
accordance
with
those
that
have
been
pronounced
in
our
own
times
by
the
vatican
council
as
orthodox
thus
says
a
knowledge
of
god
can
not
be
obtained
by
means
of
the
knowledge
a
man
has
of
himself
or
of
his
own
soul
the
attributes
of
god
can
not
be
determined
from
the
attributes
of
man
his
sovereignty
and
government
can
neither
be
compared
nor
measured

in
the
course
of
my
long
life
said
the
khalif
ali
i
have
often
observed
that
men
are
more
like
the
times
they
live
in
than
they
are
like
their
fathers
this
profoundly
philosophical
remark
of
the
of
mohammed
is
strictly
true
for
though
the
personal
the
bodily
lineaments
of
a
man
may
indicate
his
parentage
the
constitution
of
his
mind
and
therefore
the
direction
of
his
thoughts
is
determined
by
the
environment
in
which
he
lives
when
amrou
the
lieutenant
of
the
khalif
omar
conquered
egypt
and
annexed
it
to
the
saracenic
empire
he
found
in
alexandria
a
greek
grammarian
john
surnamed
philoponus
or
the
presuming
on
the
friendship
which
had
arisen
between
them
the
greek
solicited
as
a
gift
the
remnant
of
the
great
library
a
remnant
which
war
and
time
and
bigotry
had
spared
amrou
therefore
sent
to
the
khalif
to
ascertain
his
pleasure
if
replied
the
khalif
the
books
agree
with
the
koran
the
word
of
god
they
are
useless
and
need
not
be
preserved
if
they
disagree
with
it
they
are
pernicious
let
them
be
destroyed
accordingly
they
were
distributed
among
the
baths
of
alexandria
and
it
is
said
that
six
months
were
barely
sufficient
to
consume
them
although
the
fact
has
been
denied
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
omar
gave
this
order
the
khalif
was
an
illiterate
man
his
environment
was
an
environment
of
fanaticism
and
ignorance
omar
act
was
an
illustration
of
ali
remark
the
alexandrian
library
burnt
but
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
the
books
which
john
the
coveted
were
those
which
constituted
the
great
library
of
the
ptolemies
and
that
of
eumenes
king
of
pergamus
nearly
a
thousand
years
had
elapsed
since
philadelphus
began
his
collection
julius
caesar
had
burnt
more
than
half
the
patriarchs
of
alexandria
had
not
only
permitted
but
superintended
the
dispersion
of
almost
all
the
rest
orosius
expressly
states
that
he
saw
the
empty
cases
or
shelves
of
the
library
twenty
years
after
theophilus
the
uncle
of
cyril
had
procured
from
the
emperor
theodosius
a
rescript
for
its
destruction
even
had
this
once
noble
collection
never
endured
such
acts
of
violence
the
mere
wear
and
tear
and
perhaps
i
may
add
the
pilfering
of
a
thousand
years
would
have
diminished
it
sadly
though
john
as
the
surname
he
received
indicates
might
rejoice
in
a
superfluity
of
occupation
we
may
be
certain
that
the
care
of
a
library
of
half
a
million
books
would
transcend
even
his
powers
and
the
cost
of
preserving
and
supporting
it
that
had
demanded
the
ample
resources
of
the
ptolemies
and
the
caesars
was
beyond
the
means
of
a
grammarian
nor
is
the
time
required
for
its
combustion
or
destruction
any
indication
of
the
extent
of
the
collection
of
all
articles
of
fuel
parchment
is
perhaps
the
most
wretched
paper
and
papyrus
do
excellently
well
as
but
we
may
be
sure
that
the
of
alexandria
did
not
resort
to
parchment
so
long
as
they
could
find
any
thing
else
and
of
parchment
a
very
large
portion
of
these
books
was
composed
there
can
then
be
no
more
doubt
that
omar
did
order
the
destruction
of
this
library
under
an
impression
of
its
uselessness
or
its
irreligious
tendency
than
that
the
crusaders
burnt
the
library
of
tripoli
fancifully
said
to
have
consisted
of
three
million
volumes
the
first
apartment
entered
being
found
to
contain
nothing
but
the
koran
all
the
other
books
were
supposed
to
be
the
works
of
the
arabian
impostor
and
were
consequently
committed
to
the
flames
in
both
cases
the
story
contains
some
truth
and
much
exaggeration
bigotry
however
has
often
distinguished
itself
by
such
exploits
the
spaniards
burnt
in
mexico
vast
piles
of
american
an
irretrievable
loss
and
cardinal
ximenes
delivered
to
the
flames
in
the
squares
of
granada
eighty
thousand
arabic
manuscripts
many
of
them
translations
of
classical
authors
we
have
seen
how
engineering
talent
stimulated
by
alexander
persian
campaign
led
to
a
wonderful
development
of
pure
science
under
the
ptolemies
a
similar
effect
may
be
noted
as
the
result
of
the
saracenic
military
operations
the
friendship
contracted
by
amrou
the
conqueror
of
egypt
with
john
the
grammarian
indicates
how
much
the
arabian
mind
was
predisposed
to
liberal
ideas
its
step
from
the
idolatry
of
the
caaba
to
the
monotheism
of
mohammed
prepared
it
to
expatiate
in
the
wide
and
pleasing
fields
of
literature
and
philosophy
there
were
two
influences
to
which
it
was
continually
exposed
they
conspired
in
determining
its
path
these
were
that
of
the
nestorians
in
syria
that
of
the
jews
in
egypt
influence
of
the
nestorians
and
jews
in
the
last
chapter
i
have
briefly
related
the
persecution
of
nestor
and
his
disciples
they
bore
testimony
to
the
oneness
of
god
through
many
sufferings
and
martyrdoms
they
utterly
repudiated
an
olympus
filled
with
gods
and
goddesses
away
from
us
a
queen
of
heaven
such
being
their
special
views
the
nestorians
found
no
difficulty
in
affiliating
with
their
saracen
conquerors
by
whom
they
were
treated
not
only
with
the
highest
respect
but
intrusted
with
some
of
the
most
important
offices
of
the
state
mohammed
in
the
strongest
manner
prohibited
his
followers
from
committing
any
injuries
against
them
jesuiabbas
their
pontiff
concluded
treaties
both
with
the
prophet
and
with
omar
and
subsequently
the
khalif
placed
all
his
public
schools
under
the
superintendence
of
john
masue
a
nestorian
to
the
influence
of
the
nestorians
that
of
the
jews
was
added
when
christianity
displayed
a
tendency
to
unite
itself
with
paganism
the
conversion
of
the
jews
was
arrested
it
totally
ceased
when
trinitarian
ideas
were
introduced
the
cities
of
syria
and
egypt
were
full
of
jews
in
alexandria
alone
at
the
time
of
its
capture
by
amrou
there
were
forty
thousand
who
paid
tribute
centuries
of
misfortune
and
persecution
had
served
only
to
confirm
them
in
their
monotheism
and
to
strengthen
that
implacable
hatred
of
idolatry
which
they
had
cherished
ever
since
the
babylonian
captivity
associated
with
the
nestorians
they
translated
into
syriac
many
greek
and
latin
philosophical
works
which
were
retranslated
into
arabic
while
the
nestorian
was
occupied
with
the
education
of
the
children
of
the
great
mohammedan
families
the
jew
found
his
way
into
them
in
the
character
of
a
physician
fatalism
of
the
arabians
under
these
influences
the
ferocious
fanaticism
of
the
saracens
abated
their
manners
were
polished
their
thoughts
elevated
they
overran
the
realms
of
philosophy
and
science
as
quickly
as
they
had
overrun
the
provinces
of
the
roman
empire
they
abandoned
the
fallacies
of
vulgar
mohammedanism
accepting
in
their
stead
scientific
truth
in
a
world
devoted
to
idolatry
the
sword
of
the
saracen
had
vindicated
the
majesty
of
god
the
doctrine
of
fatalism
inculcated
by
the
koran
had
powerfully
contributed
to
that
result
no
man
can
anticipate
or
postpone
his
predetermined
end
death
will
overtake
us
even
in
lofty
towers
from
the
beginning
god
hath
settled
the
place
in
which
each
man
shall
die
in
his
figurative
language
the
arab
said
no
man
can
by
flight
escape
his
fate
the
destinies
ride
their
horses
by
night
whether
asleep
in
bed
or
in
the
storm
of
battle
the
angel
of
death
will
find
thee
i
am
convinced
said
ali
to
whose
wisdom
we
have
already
referred
i
am
convinced
that
the
affairs
of
men
go
by
divine
decree
and
not
by
our
administration
the
mussulmen
are
those
who
submissively
resign
themselves
to
the
will
of
god
they
reconciled
fate
and
by
saying
the
outline
is
given
us
we
color
the
picture
of
life
as
we
will
they
said
that
if
we
would
overcome
the
laws
of
nature
we
must
not
resist
we
must
balance
them
against
each
other
this
dark
doctrine
prepared
its
devotees
for
the
accomplishment
of
great
things
things
such
as
the
saracens
did
accomplish
it
converted
despair
into
resignation
and
taught
men
to
disdain
hope
there
was
a
proverb
among
them
that
despair
is
a
freeman
hope
is
a
slave
but
many
of
the
incidents
of
war
showed
plainly
that
medicines
may
assuage
pain
that
skill
may
close
wounds
that
those
who
are
incontestably
dying
may
be
snatched
from
the
grave
the
jewish
physician
became
a
living
an
accepted
protest
against
the
fatalism
of
the
koran
by
degrees
the
sternness
of
predestination
was
mitigated
and
it
was
admitted
that
in
individual
life
there
is
an
effect
due
to
that
by
his
voluntary
acts
man
may
within
certain
limits
determine
his
own
course
but
so
far
as
nations
are
concerned
since
they
can
yield
no
personal
accountability
to
god
they
are
placed
under
the
control
of
immutable
law
in
this
respect
the
contrast
between
the
christian
and
the
mohammedan
nations
was
very
striking
the
christian
was
convinced
of
incessant
providential
interventions
he
believed
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
law
in
the
government
of
the
world
by
prayers
and
entreaties
he
might
prevail
with
god
to
change
the
current
of
affairs
or
if
that
failed
he
might
succeed
with
christ
or
perhaps
with
the
virgin
mary
or
through
the
intercession
of
the
saints
or
by
the
influence
of
their
relics
or
bones
if
his
own
supplications
were
unavailing
he
might
obtain
his
desire
through
the
intervention
of
his
priest
or
through
that
of
the
holy
men
of
the
church
and
especially
if
oblations
or
gifts
of
money
were
added
christendom
believed
that
she
could
change
the
course
of
affairs
by
influencing
the
conduct
of
superior
beings
islam
rested
in
a
pious
resignation
to
the
unchangeable
will
of
god
the
prayer
of
the
christian
was
mainly
an
earnest
intercession
for
benefits
hoped
for
that
of
the
saracen
a
devout
expression
of
gratitude
for
the
past
both
substituted
prayer
for
the
ecstatic
meditation
of
india
to
the
christian
the
progress
of
the
world
was
an
exhibition
of
disconnected
impulses
of
sudden
surprises
to
the
mohammedan
that
progress
presented
a
very
different
aspect
every
corporeal
motion
was
due
to
some
preceding
motion
every
thought
to
some
preceding
thought
every
historical
event
was
the
offspring
of
some
preceding
event
every
human
action
was
the
result
of
some
foregone
and
accomplished
action
in
the
long
annals
of
our
race
nothing
has
ever
been
abruptly
introduced
there
has
been
an
orderly
an
inevitable
sequence
from
event
to
event
there
is
an
iron
chain
of
destiny
of
which
the
links
are
facts
each
stands
in
its
preordained
place
not
one
has
ever
been
disturbed
not
one
has
ever
been
removed
every
man
came
into
the
world
without
his
own
knowledge
he
is
to
depart
from
it
perhaps
against
his
own
wishes
then
let
him
calmly
fold
his
hands
and
expect
the
issues
of
fate
coincidently
with
this
change
of
opinion
as
to
the
government
of
individual
life
there
came
a
change
as
respects
the
mechanical
construction
of
the
world
according
to
the
koran
the
earth
is
a
square
plane
edged
with
vast
mountains
which
serve
the
double
purpose
of
balancing
it
in
its
seat
and
of
sustaining
the
dome
of
the
sky
our
devout
admiration
of
the
power
and
wisdom
of
god
should
be
excited
by
the
spectacle
of
this
vast
crystalline
brittle
expanse
which
has
been
safely
set
in
its
position
without
so
much
as
a
crack
or
any
other
injury
above
the
sky
and
resting
on
it
is
heaven
built
in
seven
stories
the
uppermost
being
the
habitation
of
god
who
under
the
form
of
a
gigantic
man
sits
on
a
throne
having
on
either
side
winged
bulls
like
those
in
the
palaces
of
old
assyrian
kings
they
measure
the
earth
these
ideas
which
indeed
are
not
peculiar
to
mohammedanism
but
are
entertained
by
all
men
in
a
certain
stage
of
their
intellectual
development
as
religious
revelations
were
very
quickly
exchanged
by
the
more
advanced
mohammedans
for
others
scientifically
correct
yet
as
has
been
the
case
in
christian
countries
the
advance
was
not
made
without
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
defenders
of
revealed
truth
thus
when
having
become
acquainted
with
the
globular
form
of
the
earth
gave
orders
to
his
mathematicians
and
astronomers
to
measure
a
degree
of
a
great
circle
upon
it
takyuddin
one
of
the
most
celebrated
doctors
of
divinity
of
that
time
denounced
the
wicked
khalif
declaring
that
god
would
assuredly
punish
him
for
presumptuously
interrupting
the
devotions
of
the
faithful
by
encouraging
and
diffusing
a
false
and
atheistical
philosophy
among
them
however
persisted
on
the
shores
of
the
red
sea
in
the
plains
of
shinar
by
the
aid
of
an
astrolabe
the
elevation
of
the
pole
above
the
horizon
was
determined
at
two
stations
on
the
same
meridian
exactly
one
degree
apart
the
distance
between
the
two
stations
was
then
measured
and
found
to
be
two
hundred
thousand
hashemite
cubits
this
gave
for
the
entire
circumference
of
the
earth
about
thousand
of
our
miles
a
determination
not
far
from
the
truth
but
since
the
spherical
form
could
not
be
positively
asserted
from
one
such
measurement
the
khalif
caused
another
to
be
made
near
cufa
in
mesopotamia
his
astronomers
divided
themselves
into
two
parties
and
starting
from
a
given
point
each
party
measured
an
arc
of
one
degree
the
one
northward
the
other
southward
their
result
is
given
in
cubits
if
the
cubit
employed
was
that
known
as
the
royal
cubit
the
length
of
a
degree
was
ascertained
within
of
a
mile
of
its
true
value
from
these
measures
the
khalif
concluded
that
the
globular
form
was
established
their
passion
for
science
it
is
remarkable
how
quickly
the
ferocious
fanaticism
of
the
saracens
was
transformed
into
a
passion
for
intellectual
pursuits
at
first
the
koran
was
an
obstacle
to
literature
and
science
mohammed
had
extolled
it
as
the
grandest
of
all
compositions
and
had
adduced
its
unapproachable
excellence
as
a
proof
of
his
divine
mission
but
in
little
more
than
twenty
years
after
his
death
the
experience
that
had
been
acquired
in
syria
persia
asia
minor
egypt
had
produced
a
striking
effect
and
ali
the
khalif
reigning
at
that
time
avowedly
encouraged
all
kinds
of
literary
pursuits
moawyah
the
founder
of
the
ommiade
dynasty
who
followed
in
revolutionized
the
government
it
had
been
elective
he
made
it
hereditary
he
removed
its
seat
from
medina
to
a
more
central
position
at
damascus
and
entered
on
a
career
of
luxury
and
magnificence
he
broke
the
bonds
of
a
stern
fanaticism
and
put
himself
forth
as
a
cultivator
and
patron
of
letters
thirty
years
had
wrought
a
wonderful
change
a
persian
satrap
who
had
occasion
to
pay
homage
to
omar
the
second
khalif
found
him
asleep
among
the
beggars
on
the
steps
of
the
mosque
of
medina
but
foreign
envoys
who
had
occasion
to
seek
moawyah
the
sixth
khalif
were
presented
to
him
in
a
magnificent
palace
decorated
with
exquisite
arabesques
and
adorned
with
and
fountains
their
literature
in
less
than
a
century
after
the
death
of
mohammed
translations
of
the
chief
greek
philosophical
authors
had
been
made
into
arabic
poems
such
as
the
iliad
and
the
odyssey
being
considered
to
have
an
irreligious
tendency
from
their
mythological
allusions
were
rendered
into
syriac
to
gratify
the
curiosity
of
the
learned
almansor
during
his
khalifate
transferred
the
seat
of
government
to
bagdad
which
he
converted
into
a
splendid
metropolis
he
gave
much
of
his
time
to
the
study
and
promotion
of
astronomy
and
established
schools
of
medicine
and
law
his
grandson
followed
his
example
and
ordered
that
to
every
mosque
in
his
dominions
a
school
should
be
attached
but
the
augustan
age
of
asiatic
learning
was
during
the
khalifate
of
he
made
bagdad
the
centre
of
science
collected
great
libraries
and
surrounded
himself
with
learned
men
the
elevated
taste
thus
cultivated
continued
after
the
division
of
the
saracen
empire
by
internal
dissensions
into
three
parts
the
abasside
dynasty
in
asia
the
fatimite
in
egypt
and
the
ommiade
in
spain
became
rivals
not
merely
in
politics
but
also
in
letters
and
science
they
originate
chemistry
in
letters
the
saracens
embraced
every
topic
that
can
amuse
or
edify
the
mind
in
later
times
it
was
their
boast
that
they
had
produced
more
poets
than
all
other
nations
combined
in
science
their
great
merit
consists
in
this
that
they
cultivated
it
after
the
manner
of
the
alexandrian
greeks
not
after
the
manner
of
the
european
greeks
they
perceived
that
it
can
never
be
advanced
by
mere
speculation
its
only
sure
progress
is
by
the
practical
interrogation
of
nature
the
essential
characteristics
of
their
method
are
experiment
and
observation
geometry
and
the
mathematical
sciences
they
looked
upon
as
instruments
of
reasoning
in
their
numerous
writings
on
mechanics
hydrostatics
optics
it
is
interesting
to
remark
that
the
solution
of
a
problem
is
always
obtained
by
performing
an
experiment
or
by
an
instrumental
observation
it
was
this
that
made
them
the
originators
of
chemistry
that
led
them
to
the
invention
of
all
kinds
of
apparatus
for
distillation
sublimation
fusion
filtration
etc
that
in
astronomy
caused
them
to
appeal
to
divided
instruments
as
quadrants
and
astrolabes
in
chemistry
to
employ
the
balance
the
theory
of
which
they
were
perfectly
familiar
with
to
construct
tables
of
specific
gravities
and
astronomical
tables
as
those
of
bagdad
spain
samarcand
that
produced
their
great
improvements
in
geometry
trigonometry
the
invention
of
algebra
and
the
adoption
of
the
indian
numeration
in
arithmetic
such
were
the
results
of
their
preference
of
the
inductive
method
of
aristotle
their
declining
the
reveries
of
plato
their
great
libraries
for
the
establishment
and
extension
of
the
public
libraries
books
were
sedulously
collected
thus
the
khalif
is
reported
to
have
brought
into
bagdad
hundreds
of
of
manuscripts
in
a
treaty
he
made
with
the
greek
emperor
michael
he
stipulated
that
one
of
the
constantinople
libraries
should
be
given
up
to
him
among
the
treasures
he
thus
acquired
was
the
treatise
of
ptolemy
on
the
mathematical
construction
of
the
heavens
he
had
it
forthwith
translated
into
arabic
under
the
title
of
the
collections
thus
acquired
sometimes
became
very
large
thus
the
fatimite
library
at
cairo
contained
one
hundred
thousand
volumes
elegantly
transcribed
and
bound
among
these
there
were
six
thousand
five
hundred
manuscripts
on
astronomy
and
medicine
alone
the
rules
of
this
library
permitted
the
lending
out
of
books
to
students
resident
at
cairo
it
also
contained
two
globes
one
of
massive
silver
and
one
of
brass
the
latter
was
said
to
have
been
constructed
by
ptolemy
the
former
cost
three
thousand
golden
crowns
the
great
library
of
the
spanish
khalifs
eventually
numbered
six
hundred
thousand
volumes
its
catalogue
alone
occupied
besides
this
there
were
seventy
public
libraries
in
andalusia
the
collections
in
the
possession
of
individuals
were
sometimes
very
extensive
a
private
doctor
refused
the
invitation
of
a
sultan
of
bokhara
because
the
carriage
of
his
books
would
have
required
four
hundred
camels
there
was
in
every
great
library
a
department
for
the
copying
or
manufacture
of
translations
such
manufactures
were
also
often
an
affair
of
private
enterprise
honian
a
nestorian
physician
had
an
establishment
of
the
kind
at
bagdad
he
issued
versions
of
aristotle
plato
hippocrates
galen
etc
as
to
original
works
it
was
the
custom
of
the
authorities
of
colleges
to
require
their
professors
to
prepare
treatises
on
prescribed
topics
every
khalif
had
his
own
historian
books
of
romances
and
tales
such
as
the
thousand
and
one
arabian
nights
entertainments
bear
testimony
to
the
creative
fancy
of
the
saracens
besides
these
there
were
works
on
all
kinds
of
subjects
history
jurisprudence
politics
philosophy
biographies
not
only
of
illustrious
men
but
also
of
celebrated
horses
and
camels
these
were
issued
without
any
censorship
or
restraint
though
in
later
times
works
on
theology
required
a
license
for
publication
books
of
reference
abounded
geographical
statistical
medical
historical
dictionaries
and
even
abridgments
or
condensations
of
them
as
the
encyclopedic
dictionary
of
all
the
sciences
by
mohammed
abu
abdallah
much
pride
was
taken
in
the
purity
and
whiteness
of
the
paper
in
the
skillful
intermixture
of
inks
and
in
the
illumination
of
titles
by
gilding
and
other
adornments
the
saracen
empire
was
dotted
all
over
with
colleges
they
were
established
in
mongolia
tartary
persia
mesopotamia
syria
egypt
north
africa
morocco
fez
spain
at
one
extremity
of
this
vast
region
which
far
exceeded
the
roman
empire
in
geographical
extent
were
the
college
and
astronomical
observatory
of
samarcand
at
the
other
the
giralda
in
spain
gibbon
referring
to
this
patronage
of
learning
says
the
same
royal
prerogative
was
claimed
by
the
independent
emirs
of
the
provinces
and
their
emulation
diffused
the
taste
and
the
rewards
of
science
from
samarcand
and
bokhara
to
fez
and
cordova
the
vizier
of
a
sultan
consecrated
a
sum
of
two
hundred
thousand
pieces
of
gold
to
the
foundation
of
a
college
at
bagdad
which
he
endowed
with
an
annual
revenue
of
fifteen
thousand
dinars
the
fruits
of
instruction
were
communicated
perhaps
at
different
times
to
six
thousand
disciples
of
every
degree
from
the
son
of
the
noble
to
that
of
the
mechanic
a
sufficient
allowance
was
provided
for
the
indigent
scholars
and
the
merit
or
industry
of
the
professors
was
repaid
with
adequate
stipends
in
every
city
the
productions
of
arabic
literature
were
copied
and
collected
by
the
curiosity
of
the
studious
and
the
vanity
of
the
rich
the
superintendence
of
these
schools
was
committed
with
noble
liberality
sometimes
to
nestorians
sometimes
to
jews
it
mattered
not
in
what
country
a
man
was
born
nor
what
were
his
religious
opinions
his
attainment
in
learning
was
the
only
thing
to
be
considered
the
great
khalif
had
declared
that
they
are
the
elect
of
god
his
best
and
most
useful
servants
whose
lives
are
devoted
to
the
improvement
of
their
rational
faculties
that
the
teachers
of
wisdom
are
the
true
luminaries
and
legislators
of
this
world
which
without
their
aid
would
again
sink
into
ignorance
and
barbarism
after
the
example
of
the
medical
college
of
cairo
other
medical
colleges
required
their
students
to
pass
a
rigid
examination
the
candidate
then
received
authority
to
enter
on
the
practice
of
his
profession
the
first
medical
college
established
in
europe
was
that
founded
by
the
saracens
at
salerno
in
italy
the
first
astronomical
observatory
was
that
erected
by
them
at
seville
in
spain
the
arabian
scientific
movement
it
would
far
transcend
the
limits
of
this
book
to
give
an
adequate
statement
of
the
results
of
this
imposing
scientific
movement
the
ancient
sciences
were
greatly
extended
new
ones
were
brought
into
existence
the
indian
method
of
arithmetic
was
introduced
a
beautiful
invention
which
expresses
all
numbers
by
ten
characters
giving
them
an
absolute
value
and
a
value
by
position
and
furnishing
simple
rules
for
the
easy
performance
of
all
kinds
of
calculations
algebra
or
universal
arithmetic
the
method
of
calculating
indeterminate
quantities
or
investigating
the
relations
that
subsist
among
quantities
of
all
kinds
whether
arithmetical
or
geometrical
was
developed
from
the
germ
that
diophantus
had
left
mohammed
ben
musa
furnished
the
solution
of
quadratic
equations
omar
ben
ibra
him
that
of
cubic
equations
the
saracens
also
gave
to
trigonometry
its
modern
form
substituting
sines
for
chords
which
had
been
previously
used
they
elevated
it
into
a
separate
science
musa
above
mentioned
was
the
author
of
a
treatise
on
spherical
trigonometry
left
one
on
so
excellent
that
by
some
it
has
been
declared
to
be
a
copy
of
euclid
lost
work
on
that
subject
arabian
astronomy
in
astronomy
they
not
only
made
catalogues
but
maps
of
the
stars
visible
in
their
skies
giving
to
those
of
the
larger
magnitudes
the
arabic
names
they
still
bear
on
our
celestial
globes
they
ascertained
as
we
have
seen
the
size
of
the
earth
by
the
measurement
of
a
degree
on
her
surface
determined
the
obliquity
of

published
corrected
tables
of
the
sun
and

fixed
the

verified
the
precession
of
the
equinoxes
the
treatise
of
albategnius
on
the
science
of
the
stars
is
spoken
of
by
laplace
with
respect
he
also
draws
attention
to
an
important
fragment
of
the
astronomer
of
hakem
the
khalif
of
egypt
as
containing
a
long
series
of
observations
from
the
time
of
almansor
of
eclipses
equinoxes
solstices
conjunctions
of
planets
occultations
of
stars
observations
which
have
cast
much
light
on
the
great
variations
of
the
system
of
the
world
the
arabian
astronomers
also
devoted
themselves
to
the
construction
and
perfection
of
astronomical
instruments
to
the
measurement
of
time
by
clocks
of
various
kinds
by
clepsydras
and
they
were
the
first
to
introduce
for
this
purpose
the
use
of
the
pendulum
in
the
experimental
sciences
they
originated
chemistry
they
discovered
some
of
its
most
important
reagents
sulphuric
acid
nitric
acid
alcohol
they
applied
that
science
in
the
practice
of
medicine
being
the
first
to
publish
pharmacopoeias
or
dispensatories
and
to
include
in
them
mineral
preparations
in
mechanics
they
had
determined
the
laws
of
falling
bodies
had
ideas
by
no
means
indistinct
of
the
nature
of
gravity
they
were
familiar
with
the
theory
of
the
mechanical
powers
in
hydrostatics
they
constructed
the
first
tables
of
the
specific
gravities
of
bodies
and
wrote
treatises
on
the
flotation
and
sinking
of
bodies
in
water
in
optics
they
corrected
the
greek
misconception
that
a
ray
proceeds
from
the
eye
and
touches
the
object
seen
introducing
the
hypothesis
that
the
ray
passes
from
the
object
to
the
eye
they
understood
the
phenomena
of
the
reflection
and
refraction
of
light
alhazen
made
the
great
discovery
of
the
curvilinear
path
of
a
ray
of
light
through
the
atmosphere
and
proved
that
we
see
the
sun
and
moon
before
they
have
risen
and
after
they
have
set
agriculture
and
manufacture
the
effects
of
this
scientific
activity
are
plainly
perceived
in
the
great
improvements
that
took
place
in
many
of
the
industrial
arts
agriculture
shows
it
in
better
methods
of
irrigation
the
skillful
employment
of
manures
the
raising
of
improved
breeds
of
cattle
the
enactment
of
wise
codes
of
rural
laws
the
introduction
of
the
culture
of
rice
and
that
of
sugar
and
coffee
the
manufactures
show
it
in
the
great
extension
of
the
industries
of
silk
cotton
wool
in
the
fabrication
of
cordova
and
morocco
leather
and
paper
in
mining
casting
and
various
metallurgic
operations
in
the
making
of
toledo
blades
passionate
lovers
of
poetry
and
music
they
dedicated
much
of
their
leisure
time
to
those
elegant
pursuits
they
taught
europe
the
game
of
chess
they
gave
it
its
taste
for
works
of
fiction
romances
and
novels
in
the
graver
domains
of
literature
they
took
delight
they
had
many
admirable
compositions
on
such
subjects
as
the
instability
of
human
greatness
the
consequences
of
irreligion
the
reverses
of
fortune
the
origin
duration
and
end
of
the
world
sometimes
not
without
surprise
we
meet
with
ideas
which
we
flatter
ourselves
have
originated
in
our
own
times
thus
our
modern
doctrines
of
evolution
and
development
were
taught
in
their
schools
in
fact
they
carried
them
much
farther
than
we
are
disposed
to
do
extending
them
even
to
inorganic
or
mineral
things
the
fundamental
principle
of
alchemy
was
the
natural
process
of
development
of
metalline
bodies
when
common
people
says
writing
in
the
twelfth
century
hear
from
natural
philosophers
that
gold
is
a
body
which
has
attained
to
perfection
of
maturity
to
the
goal
of
completeness
they
firmly
believe
that
it
is
something
which
has
gradually
come
to
that
perfection
by
passing
through
the
forms
of
all
other
metallic
bodies
so
that
its
gold
nature
was
originally
lead
afterward
it
became
tin
then
brass
then
silver
and
finally
reached
the
development
of
gold
not
knowing
that
the
natural
philosophers
mean
in
saying
this
only
something
like
what
they
mean
when
they
speak
of
man
and
attribute
to
him
a
completeness
and
equilibrium
in
nature
and
constitution
not
that
man
was
once
a
bull
and
was
changed
into
an
ass
and
afterward
into
a
horse
and
after
that
into
an
ape

finally
became
a
man

philosophical
views
of
the
the
vedic

doctrine
of
emanation
and
it
is
advocated
by
aristotle
who
is
followed
by
the
alexandrian
school
and
subsequently
by
the
jews
and
it
is
found
in
the
writings
of

connection
of
this
doctrine
with
the
theory
of
conservation
and

of

therefore
without

whose
conceptions
of
a

and
of
heaven

the
abodes
of
the
blessed
and
the
sinful
were
far
more
vivid
than
those
of
their
pagan
predecessors
accepted
and
intensified
these
ancient
ideas
they
did
not
doubt
that
in
the
world
to
come
they
should
meet
their
friends
and
hold
converse
with
them
as
they
had
done
here
upon

an
expectation
that
gives
consolation
to
the
human
heart
reconciling
it
to
the
most
sorrowful
bereavements
and
restoring
to
it
its
dead
in
the
uncertainty
as
to
what
becomes
of
the
soul
in
the
interval
between
its
separation
from
the
body
and
the
many
different
opinions
were
held
some
thought
that
it
hovered
over
the
grave
some
that
it
wandered
disconsolate
through
the
air
in
the
popular
belief
peter
sat
as
a
at
the
gate
of
heaven
to
him
it
had
been
given
to
bind
or
to
loose
he
admitted
or
excluded
the
spirits
of
men
at
his
pleasure
many
persons
however
were
disposed
to
deny
him
this
power
since
his
decisions
would
be
anticipatory
of
the
which
would
thus
be
rendered
needless
after
the
time
of
gregory
the
great
the
doctrine
of
purgatory
met
with
general
acceptance
a
was
provided
for
departed
spirits
that
the
spirits
of
the
dead
occasionally
revisit
the
living
or
haunt
their
former
abodes
has
been
in
all
ages
in
all
european
countries
a
fixed
belief
not
confined
to
rustics
but
participated
in
by
the
intelligent
a
pleasing
terror
gathers
round
the
fireside
at
the
stories
of
apparitions
goblins
ghosts
in
the
old
times
the
romans
had
their
lares
or
spirits
of
those
who
had
led
virtuous
lives
their
larvae
or
lemures
the
spirits
of
the
wicked
their
manes
the
spirits
of
those
of
whom
the
merits
were
doubtful
if
human
testimony
on
such
subjects
can
be
of
any
value
there
is
a
body
of
evidence
reaching
from
the
remotest
ages
to
the
present
time
as
extensive
and
unimpeachable
as
is
to
be
found
in
support
of
any
thing
whatever
that
these
shades
of
the
dead
congregate
near
tombstones
or
take
up
their
secret
abode
in
the
gloomy
chambers
of
dilapidated
castles
or
walk
by
moonlight
in
moody
solitude
asiatic
psychological
views
while
these
opinions
have
universally
found
popular
acceptance
in
europe
others
of
a
very
different
nature
have
prevailed
extensively
in
asia
and
indeed
very
generally
in
the
higher
regions
of
thought
ecclesiastical
authority
succeeded
in
repressing
them
in
the
sixteenth
century
but
they
never
altogether
disappeared
in
our
own
times
so
silently
and
extensively
have
they
been
diffused
in
europe
that
it
was
found
expedient
in
the
papal
syllabus
to
draw
them
in
a
very
conspicuous
manner
into
the
open
light
and
the
vatican
council
agreeing
in
that
view
of
their
obnoxious
tendency
and
secret
spread
has
in
an
equally
prominent
and
signal
manner
among
its
first
canons
anathematized
all
persons
who
hold
them
let
him
be
anathema
who
says
that
spiritual
things
are
emanations
of
the
divine
substance
or
that
the
divine
essence
by
manifestation
or
development
becomes
all
things
in
view
of
this
authoritative
action
it
is
necessary
now
to
consider
the
character
and
history
of
these
opinions
ideas
respecting
the
nature
of
god
necessarily
influence
ideas
respecting
the
nature
of
the
soul
the
eastern
asiatics
had
adopted
the
conception
of
an
impersonal
god
and
as
regards
the
soul
its
necessary
consequence
the
doctrine
of
emanation
and
absorption
emanation
and
absorption
thus
the
vedic
theology
is
based
on
the
acknowledgment
of
a
universal
spirit
pervading
all
things
there
is
in
truth
but
one
deity
the
supreme
spirit
he
is
of
the
same
nature
as
the
soul
of
man
both
the
vedas
and
the
institutes
of
menu
affirm
that
the
soul
is
an
emanation
of
the
intellect
and
that
it
is
necessarily
destined
to
be
reabsorbed
they
consider
it
to
be
without
form
and
that
visible
nature
with
all
its
beauties
and
harmonies
is
only
the
shadow
of
god
vedaism
developed
itself
into
buddhism
which
has
become
the
faith
of
a
majority
of
the
human
race
this
system
acknowledges
that
there
is
a
supreme
power
but
denies
that
there
is
a
supreme
being
it
contemplates
the
existence
of
force
giving
rise
as
its
manifestation
to
matter
it
adopts
the
theory
of
emanation
and
absorption
in
a
burning
taper
it
sees
an
effigy
of
man
an
embodiment
of
matter
and
an
evolution
of
force
if
we
interrogate
it
respecting
the
destiny
of
the
soul
it
demands
of
us
what
has
become
of
the
flame
when
it
is
blown
out
and
in
what
condition
it
was
before
the
taper
was
lighted
was
it
a
nonentity
has
it
been
annihilated
it
admits
that
the
idea
of
personality
which
has
deluded
us
through
life
may
not
be
instantaneously
extinguished
at
death
but
may
be
lost
by
slow
degrees
on
this
is
founded
the
doctrine
of
transmigration
but
at
length
reunion
with
the
universal
intellect
takes
place
nirwana
is
reached
oblivion
is
attained
a
state
that
has
no
relation
to
matter
space
or
time
the
state
into
which
the
departed
flame
of
the
extinguished
taper
has
gone
the
state
in
which
we
were
before
we
were
born
this
is
the
end
that
we
ought
to
hope
for
it
is
reabsorption
in
the
universal
force
supreme
bliss
eternal
rest
through
aristotle
these
doctrines
were
first
introduced
into
eastern
europe
indeed
eventually
as
we
shall
see
he
was
regarded
as
the
author
of
them
they
exerted
a
dominating
influence
in
the
later
period
of
the
alexandrian
school
philo
the
jew
who
lived
in
the
time
of
caligula
based
his
philosophy
on
the
theory
of
emanation
plotinus
not
only
accepted
that
theory
as
applicable
to
the
soul
of
man
but
as
affording
an
illustration
of
the
nature
of
the
trinity
for
as
a
beam
of
light
emanates
from
the
sun
and
as
warmth
emanates
from
the
beam
when
it
touches
material
bodies
so
from
the
father
the
son
emanates
and
thence
the
holy
ghost
from
these
views
plotinus
derived
a
practical
religious
system
teaching
the
devout
how
to
pass
into
a
condition
of
ecstasy
a
foretaste
of
absorption
into
the
universal
mundane
soul
in
that
condition
the
soul
loses
its
individual
consciousness
in
like
manner
porphyry
sought
absorption
in
or
union
with
god
he
was
a
tyrian
by
birth
established
a
school
at
rome
and
wrote
against
christianity
his
treatise
on
that
subject
was
answered
by
eusebius
and
jerome
but
the
emperor
theodosius
silenced
it
more
effectually
by
causing
all
the
copies
to
be
burnt
porphyry
bewails
his
own
unworthiness
saying
that
he
had
been
united
to
god
in
ecstasy
but
once
in
years
whereas
his
master
plotinus
had
been
so
united
six
times
in
sixty
years
a
complete
system
of
theology
based
on
the
theory
of
emanation
was
constructed
by
proclus
who
speculated
on
the
manner
in
which
absorption
takes
place
whether
the
soul
is
instantly
reabsorbed
and
reunited
in
the
moment
of
death
or
whether
it
retains
the
sentiment
of
personality
for
a
time
and
subsides
into
complete
reunion
by
successive
steps
arabic
psychology
from
the
alexandrian
greeks
these
ideas
passed
to
the
saracen
philosophers
who
very
soon
after
the
capture
of
the
great
egyptian
city
abandoned
to
the
lower
orders
their
anthropomorphic
notions
of
the
nature
of
god
and
the
simulachral
form
of
the
spirit
of
man
as
arabism
developed
itself
into
a
distinct
scientific
system
the
theories
of
emanation
and
absorption
were
among
its
characteristic
features
in
this
abandonment
of
vulgar
mohammedanism
the
example
of
the
jews
greatly
assisted
they
too
had
given
up
the
anthropomorphism
of
their
ancestors
they
had
exchanged
the
god
who
of
old
lived
behind
the
veil
of
the
temple
for
an
infinite
intelligence
pervading
the
universe
and
avowing
their
inability
to
conceive
that
any
thing
which
had
on
a
sudden
been
called
into
existence
should
be
capable
of
immortality
they
affirmed
that
the
soul
of
man
is
connected
with
a
past
of
which
there
was
no
beginning
and
with
a
future
to
which
there
is
no
end
in
the
intellectual
history
of
arabism
the
jew
and
the
saracen
are
continually
seen
together
it
was
the
same
in
their
political
history
whether
we
consider
it
in
syria
in
egypt
or
in
spain
from
them
conjointly
western
europe
derived
its
philosophical
ideas
which
in
the
course
of
time
culminated
in
averroism
averroism
is
philosophical
islamism
europeans
generally
regarded
averroes
as
the
author
of
these
heresies
and
the
orthodox
branded
him
accordingly
but
he
was
nothing
more
than
their
collector
and
commentator
his
works
invaded
christendom
by
two
routes
from
spain
through
southern
france
they
reached
upper
italy
engendering
numerous
heresies
on
their
way
from
sicily
they
passed
to
naples
and
south
italy
under
the
auspices
of
frederick
ii
but
long
before
europe
suffered
this
great
intellectual
invasion
there
were
what
might
perhaps
be
termed
sporadic
instances
of
orientalism
as
an
example
i
may
quote
the
views
of
john
erigena
he
had
adopted
and
taught
the
philosophy
of
aristotle
had
made
a
pilgrimage
to
the
birthplace
of
that
philosopher
and
indulged
a
hope
of
uniting
philosophy
and
religion
in
the
manner
proposed
by
the
christian
ecclesiastics
who
were
then
studying
in
the
mohammedan
universities
of
spain
he
was
a
native
of
britain
in
a
letter
to
charles
the
bald
anastasius
expresses
his
astonishment
how
such
a
barbarian
man
coming
from
the
very
ends
of
the
earth
and
remote
from
human
conversation
could
comprehend
things
so
clearly
and
transfer
them
into
another
language
so
well
the
general
intention
of
his
writings
was
as
we
have
said
to
unite
philosophy
with
religion
but
his
treatment
of
these
subjects
brought
him
under
ecclesiastical
censure
and
some
of
his
works
were
adjudged
to
the
flames
his
most
important
book
is
entitled
de
divisione
nature
erigena
philosophy
rests
upon
the
observed
and
admitted
fact
that
every
living
thing
comes
from
something
that
had
previously
lived
the
visible
world
being
a
world
of
life
has
therefore
emanated
necessarily
from
some
primordial
existence
and
that
existence
is
god
who
is
thus
the
originator
and
conservator
of
all
whatever
we
see
maintains
itself
as
a
visible
thing
through
force
derived
from
him
and
were
that
force
withdrawn
it
must
necessarily
disappear
erigena
thus
conceives
of
the
deity
as
an
unceasing
participator
in
nature
being
its
preserver
maintainer
upholder
and
in
that
respect
answering
to
the
soul
of
the
world
of
the
greeks
the
particular
life
of
individuals
is
therefore
a
part
of
general
existence
that
is
of
the
mundane
soul
if
ever
there
were
a
withdrawal
of
the
maintaining
power
all
things
must
return
to
the
source
from
which
they
issued
that
is
they
must
return
to
god
and
be
absorbed
in
him
all
visible
nature
must
thus
pass
back
into
the
intellect
at
last
the
death
of
the
flesh
is
the
auspices
of
the
restitution
of
things
and
of
a
return
to
their
ancient
conservation
so
sounds
revert
back
to
the
air
in
which
they
were
born
and
by
which
they
were
maintained
and
they
are
heard
no
more
no
man
knows
what
has
become
of
them
in
that
final
absorption
which
after
a
lapse
of
time
must
necessarily
come
god
will
be
all
in
all
and
nothing
exist
but
him
alone
i
contemplate
him
as
the
beginning
and
cause
of
all
things
all
things
that
are
and
those
that
have
been
but
now
are
not
were
created
from
him
and
by
him
and
in
him
i
also
view
him
as
the
end
and
intransgressible
term
of
all
things
there
is
a
fourfold
conception
of
universal
nature
two
views
of
divine
nature
as
origin
and
end
two
also
of
framed
nature
causes
and
effects
there
is
nothing
eternal
but
god
the
return
of
the
soul
to
the
universal
intellect
is
designated
by
erigena
as
theosis
or
deification
in
that
final
absorption
all
remembrance
of
its
past
experiences
is
lost
the
soul
reverts
to
the
condition
in
which
it
was
before
it
animated
the
body
necessarily
therefore
erigena
fell
under
the
displeasure
of
the
church
it
was
in
india
that
men
first
recognized
the
fact
that
force
is
indestructible
and
eternal
this
implies
ideas
more
or
less
distinct
of
that
which
we
now
term
its
correlation
and
conservation
considerations
connected
with
the
stability
of
the
universe
give
strength
to
this
view
since
it
is
clear
that
were
there
either
an
increase
or
a
diminution
the
order
of
the
world
must
cease
the
definite
and
invariable
amount
of
energy
in
the
universe
must
therefore
be
accepted
as
a
scientific
fact
the
changes
we
witness
are
in
its
distribution
but
since
the
soul
must
be
regarded
as
an
active
principle
to
call
a
new
one
into
existence
out
of
nothing
is
necessarily
to
add
to
the
force
previously
in
the
world
and
if
this
has
been
done
in
the
case
of
every
individual
who
has
been
born
and
is
to
be
repeated
for
every
individual
hereafter
the
totality
of
force
must
be
continually
increasing
moreover
to
many
devout
persons
there
is
something
very
revolting
in
the
suggestion
that
the
almighty
is
a
servitor
to
the
caprices
and
lusts
of
man
and
that
at
a
certain
term
after
its
origin
it
is
necessary
for
him
to
create
for
the
embryo
a
soul
considering
man
as
composed
of
two
portions
a
soul
and
a
body
the
obvious
relations
of
the
latter
may
cast
much
light
on
the
mysterious
the
obscure
relations
of
the
former
now
the
substance
of
which
the
body
consists
is
obtained
from
the
general
mass
of
matter
around
us
and
after
death
to
that
general
mass
it
is
restored
has
nature
then
displayed
before
our
eyes
in
the
origin
mutations
and
destiny
of
the
material
part
the
body
a
revelation
that
may
guide
us
to
a
knowledge
of
the
origin
and
destiny
of
the
companion
the
spiritual
part
the
soul
let
us
listen
for
a
moment
to
one
of
the
most
powerful
of
mohammedan
writers
god
has
created
the
spirit
of
man
out
of
a
drop
of
his
own
light
its
destiny
is
to
return
to
him
do
not
deceive
yourself
with
the
vain
imagination
that
it
will
die
when
the
body
dies
the
form
you
had
on
your
entrance
into
this
world
and
your
present
form
are
not
the
same
hence
there
is
no
necessity
of
your
perishing
on
account
of
the
perishing
of
your
body
your
spirit
came
into
this
world
a
stranger
it
is
only
sojourning
in
a
temporary
home
from
the
trials
and
tempests
of
this
troublesome
life
our
refuge
is
in
god
in
reunion
with
him
we
shall
find
eternal
rest
a
rest
without
sorrow
a
joy
without
pain
a
strength
without
infirmity
a
knowledge
without
doubt
a
tranquil
and
yet
an
ecstatic
vision
of
the
source
of
life
and
light
and
glory
the
source
from
which
we
came
so
says
the
saracen
philosopher
in
a
stone
the
material
particles
are
in
a
state
of
stable
equilibrium
it
may
therefore
endure
forever
an
animal
is
in
reality
only
a
form
through
which
a
stream
of
matter
is
incessantly
flowing
it
receives
its
supplies
and
dismisses
its
wastes
in
this
it
resembles
a
cataract
a
river
a
flame
the
particles
that
compose
it
at
one
instant
have
departed
from
it
the
next
it
depends
for
its
continuance
on
exterior
supplies
it
has
a
definite
duration
in
time
and
an
inevitable
moment
comes
in
which
it
must
die
in
the
great
problem
of
psychology
we
can
not
expect
to
reach
a
scientific
result
if
we
persist
in
restricting
ourselves
to
the
contemplation
of
one
fact
we
must
avail
ourselves
of
all
accessible
facts
human
psychology
can
never
be
completely
resolved
except
through
comparative
psychology
with
descartes
we
must
inquire
whether
the
souls
of
animals
be
relations
of
the
human
soul
less
perfect
members
in
the
same
series
of
development
we
must
take
account
of
what
we
discover
in
the
intelligent
principle
of
the
ant
as
well
as
what
we
discern
in
the
intelligent
principle
of
man
where
would
human
physiology
be
if
it
were
not
illuminated
by
the
bright
irradiations
of
comparative
physiology
brodie
after
an
exhaustive
consideration
of
the
facts
affirms
that
the
mind
of
animals
is
essentially
the
same
as
that
of
man
every
one
familiar
with
the
dog
will
admit
that
that
creature
knows
right
from
wrong
and
is
conscious
when
he
has
committed
a
fault
many
domestic
animals
have
reasoning
powers
and
employ
proper
means
for
the
attainment
of
ends
how
numerous
are
the
anecdotes
related
of
the
intentional
actions
of
the
elephant
and
the
ape
nor
is
this
apparent
intelligence
due
to
imitation
to
their
association
with
man
for
wild
animals
that
have
no
such
relation
exhibit
similar
properties
in
different
species
the
capacity
and
character
greatly
vary
thus
the
dog
is
not
only
more
intelligent
but
has
social
and
moral
qualities
that
the
cat
does
not
possess
the
former
loves
his
master
the
latter
her
home
du
makes
this
striking
remark
with
awe
and
wonder
must
the
student
of
nature
regard
that
microscopic
molecule
of
nervous
substance
which
is
the
seat
of
the
laborious
constructive
orderly
loyal
dauntless
soul
of
the
ant
it
has
developed
itself
to
its
present
state
through
a
countless
series
of
generations
what
an
impressive
inference
we
may
draw
from
the
statement
of
huber
who
has
written
so
well
on
this
subject
if
you
will
watch
a
single
ant
at
work
you
can
tell
what
he
will
next
do
he
is
considering
the
matter
and
reasoning
as
you
are
doing
listen
to
one
of
the
many
anecdotes
which
huber
at
once
truthful
and
artless
relates
on
the
visit
of
an
overseer
ant
to
the
works
when
the
laborers
had
begun
the
roof
too
soon
he
examined
it
and
had
it
taken
down
the
wall
raised
to
the
proper
height
and
a
new
ceiling
constructed
with
the
fragments
of
the
old
one
surely
these
insects
are
not
automata
they
show
intention
they
recognize
their
old
companions
who
have
been
shut
up
from
them
for
many
months
and
exhibit
sentiments
of
joy
at
their
return
their
antennal
language
is
capable
of
manifold
expression
it
suits
the
interior
of
the
nest
where
all
is
dark
while
solitary
insects
do
not
live
to
raise
their
young
social
insects
have
a
longer
term
they
exhibit
moral
affections
and
educate
their
offspring
patterns
of
patience
and
industry
some
of
these
insignificant
creatures
will
work
sixteen
or
eighteen
hours
a
day
few
men
are
capable
of
sustained
mental
application
more
than
four
or
five
hours
similarity
of
effects
indicates
similarity
of
causes
similarity
of
actions
demands
similarity
of
organs
i
would
ask
the
reader
of
these
paragraphs
who
is
familiar
with
the
habits
of
animals
and
especially
with
the
social
relations
of
that
wonderful
insect
to
which
reference
has
been
made
to
turn
to
the
nineteenth
chapter
of
my
work
on
the
intellectual
development
of
europe
in
which
he
will
find
a
description
of
the
social
system
of
the
incas
of
peru
perhaps
then
in
view
of
the
similarity
of
the
social
institutions
and
personal
conduct
of
the
insect
and
the
social
institutions
and
personal
conduct
of
the
civilized
indian
the
one
an
insignificant
speck
the
other
a
man
he
will
not
be
disposed
to
disagree
with
me
in
the
opinion
that
from
bees
and
wasps
and
ants
and
birds
from
all
that
low
animal
life
on
which
he
looks
with
supercilious
contempt
man
is
destined
one
day
to
learn
what
in
truth
he
really
is
the
views
of
descartes
who
regarded
all
insects
as
automata
can
scarcely
be
accepted
without
modification
insects
are
automata
only
so
far
as
the
action
of
their
ventral
cord
and
that
portion
of
their
cephalic
ganglia
which
deals
with
contemporaneous
impressions
is
concerned
it
is
one
of
the
functions
of
material
to
retain
traces
or
relics
of
impressions
brought
to
it
by
the
organs
of
sense
hence
nervous
ganglia
being
composed
of
that
material
may
be
considered
as
registering
apparatus
they
also
introduce
the
element
of
time
into
the
action
of
the
nervous
mechanism
an
impression
which
without
them
might
have
forthwith
ended
in
reflex
action
is
delayed
and
with
this
duration
come
all
those
important
effects
arising
through
the
interaction
of
many
impressions
old
and
new
upon
each
other
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
spontaneous
or
thought
every
intellectual
act
is
the
consequence
of
some
preceding
act
it
comes
into
existence
in
virtue
of
something
that
has
gone
before
two
minds
constituted
precisely
alike
and
placed
under
the
influence
of
precisely
the
same
environment
must
give
rise
to
precisely
the
same
thought
to
such
sameness
of
action
we
allude
in
the
popular
expression
a
term
full
of
meaning
in
the
origination
of
a
thought
there
are
two
distinct
conditions
the
state
of
the
organism
as
dependent
on
antecedent
impressions
and
on
the
existing
physical
circumstances
in
the
cephalic
ganglia
of
insects
are
stored
up
the
relics
of
impressions
that
have
been
made
upon
the
common
peripheral
nerves
and
in
them
are
kept
those
which
are
brought
in
by
the
organs
of
special
sense
the
visual
olfactive
auditory
the
interaction
of
these
raises
insects
above
mere
mechanical
automata
in
which
the
reaction
instantly
follows
the
impression
in
all
cases
the
action
of
every
no
matter
what
its
stage
of
development
may
be
high
or
low
depends
upon
an
essential
chemical
condition
oxidation
even
in
man
if
the
supply
of
arterial
blood
be
stopped
but
for
a
moment
the
loses
its
power
if
diminished
it
correspondingly
declines
if
on
the
contrary
it
be
increased
as
when
nitrogen
monoxide
is
breathed
there
is
more
energetic
action
hence
there
arises
a
need
of
repair
a
necessity
for
rest
and
sleep
two
fundamental
ideas
are
essentially
attached
to
all
our
perceptions
of
external
things
they
are
space
and
time
and
for
these
provision
is
made
in
the
nervous
mechanism
while
it
is
yet
in
an
almost
rudimentary
state
the
eye
is
the
organ
of
space
the
ear
of
time
the
perceptions
of
which
by
the
elaborate
mechanism
of
these
structures
become
infinitely
more
precise
than
would
be
possible
if
the
sense
of
touch
alone
were
resorted
to
there
are
some
simple
experiments
which
illustrate
the
vestiges
of
ganglionic
impressions
if
on
a
cold
polished
metal
as
a
new
razor
any
object
such
as
a
wafer
be
laid
and
the
metal
be
then
breathed
upon
and
when
the
moisture
has
had
time
to
disappear
the
wafer
be
thrown
off
though
now
the
most
critical
inspection
of
the
polished
surface
can
discover
no
trace
of
any
form
if
we
breathe
once
more
upon
it
a
spectral
image
of
the
wafer
comes
plainly
into
view
and
this
may
be
done
again
and
again
nay
more
if
the
polished
metal
be
carefully
put
aside
where
nothing
can
deteriorate
its
surface
and
be
so
kept
for
many
months
on
breathing
again
upon
it
the
shadowy
form
emerges
such
an
illustration
shows
how
trivial
an
impression
may
be
thus
registered
and
preserved
but
if
on
such
an
inorganic
surface
an
impression
may
thus
be
indelibly
marked
how
much
more
likely
in
the
ganglion
a
shadow
never
falls
upon
a
wall
without
leaving
thereupon
a
permanent
trace
a
trace
which
might
be
made
visible
by
resorting
to
proper
processes
photographic
operations
are
cases
in
point
the
portraits
of
our
friends
or
landscape
views
may
be
hidden
on
the
sensitive
surface
from
the
eye
but
they
are
ready
to
make
their
appearance
as
soon
as
proper
developers
are
resorted
to
a
spectre
is
concealed
on
a
silver
or
glassy
surface
until
by
our
necromancy
we
make
it
come
forth
into
the
visible
world
upon
the
walls
of
our
most
private
apartments
where
we
think
the
eye
of
intrusion
is
altogether
shut
out
and
our
retirement
can
never
be
profaned
there
exist
the
vestiges
of
all
our
acts
silhouettes
of
whatever
we
have
done
if
after
the
eyelids
have
been
closed
for
some
time
as
when
we
first
awake
in
the
morning
we
suddenly
and
steadfastly
gaze
at
a
object
and
then
quickly
close
the
lids
again
a
phantom
image
is
perceived
in
the
indefinite
darkness
beyond
us
we
may
satisfy
ourselves
that
this
is
not
a
fiction
but
a
reality
for
many
details
that
we
had
not
time
to
identify
in
the
momentary
glance
may
be
contemplated
at
our
leisure
in
the
phantom
we
may
thus
make
out
the
pattern
of
such
an
object
as
a
lace
curtain
hanging
in
the
window
or
the
branches
of
a
tree
beyond
by
degrees
the
image
becomes
less
and
less
distinct
in
a
minute
or
two
it
has
disappeared
it
seems
to
have
a
tendency
to
float
away
in
the
vacancy
before
us
if
we
attempt
to
follow
it
by
moving
the
eyeball
it
suddenly
vanishes
such
a
duration
of
impressions
on
the
retina
proves
that
the
effect
of
external
influences
on
is
not
necessarily
transitory
in
this
there
is
a
correspondence
to
the
duration
the
emergence
the
extinction
of
impressions
on
photographic
preparations
thus
i
have
seen
landscapes
and
architectural
views
taken
in
mexico
developed
as
artists
say
months
subsequently
in
new
york
the
images
coming
out
after
the
long
voyage
in
all
their
proper
forms
and
in
all
their
proper
contrast
of
light
and
shade
the
photograph
had
forgotten
nothing
it
had
equally
preserved
the
contour
of
the
everlasting
mountains
and
the
passing
smoke
of
a
are
there
then
contained
in
the
brain
more
permanently
as
in
the
retina
more
transiently
the
vestiges
of
impressions
that
have
been
gathered
by
the
sensory
organs
is
this
the
explanation
of
memory
the
mind
contemplating
such
pictures
of
past
things
and
events
as
have
been
committed
to
her
custody
in
her
silent
galleries
are
there
hung
micrographs
of
the
living
and
the
dead
of
scenes
that
we
have
visited
of
incidents
in
which
we
have
borne
a
part
are
these
abiding
impressions
mere
like
the
letters
of
a
book
which
impart
ideas
to
the
mind
or
are
they
actual
inconceivably
smaller
than
those
made
for
us
by
artists
in
which
by
the
aid
of
a
microscope
we
can
see
in
a
space
not
bigger
than
a
pinhole
a
whole
family
group
at
a
glance
the
phantom
images
of
the
retina
are
not
perceptible
in
the
light
of
the
day
those
that
exist
in
the
sensorium
in
like
manner
do
not
attract
our
attention
so
long
as
the
sensory
organs
are
in
vigorous
operation
and
occupied
in
bringing
new
impressions
in
but
when
those
organs
become
weary
or
dull
or
when
we
experience
hours
of
great
anxiety
or
are
in
twilight
reveries
or
are
asleep
the
latent
apparitions
have
their
vividness
increased
by
the
contrast
and
obtrude
themselves
on
the
mind
for
the
same
reason
they
occupy
us
in
the
delirium
of
fevers
and
doubtless
also
in
the
solemn
moments
of
death
during
a
third
part
of
our
life
in
sleep
we
are
withdrawn
from
external
influences
hearing
and
sight
and
the
other
senses
are
inactive
but
the
mind
that
pensive
that
veiled
enchantress
in
her
mysterious
retirement
looks
over
the
ambrotypes
she
has
collected
ambrotypes
for
they
are
truly
unfading
impressions
and
combining
them
together
as
they
chance
to
occur
constructs
from
them
the
panorama
of
a
dream
nature
has
thus
implanted
in
the
organization
of
every
man
means
which
impressively
suggest
to
him
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
a
future
life
even
the
benighted
savage
thus
sees
in
his
visions
the
fading
forms
of
landscapes
which
are
perhaps
connected
with
some
of
his
most
pleasant
recollections
and
what
other
conclusion
can
be
possibly
extract
from
those
unreal
pictures
than
that
they
are
the
foreshadowings
of
another
land
beyond
that
in
which
his
lot
is
cast
at
intervals
he
is
visited
in
his
dreams
by
the
resemblances
of
those
whom
he
has
loved
or
hated
while
they
were
alive
and
these
manifestations
are
to
him
incontrovertible
proofs
of
the
existence
and
immortality
of
the
soul
in
our
most
refined
social
conditions
we
are
never
able
to
shake
off
the
impressions
of
these
occurrences
and
are
perpetually
drawing
from
them
the
same
conclusions
that
our
uncivilized
ancestors
did
our
more
elevated
condition
of
life
in
no
respect
relieves
us
from
the
inevitable
operation
of
our
own
organization
any
more
than
it
relieves
us
from
infirmities
and
disease
in
these
respects
all
over
the
globe
men
are
on
an
equality
savage
or
civilized
we
carry
within
us
a
mechanism
which
presents
us
with
mementoes
of
the
most
solemn
facts
with
which
we
can
be
concerned
it
wants
only
moments
of
repose
or
sickness
when
the
influence
of
external
things
is
diminished
to
come
into
full
play
and
these
are
precisely
the
moments
when
we
are
best
prepared
for
the
truths
it
is
going
to
suggest
that
mechanism
is
no
respecter
of
persons
it
neither
permits
the
haughtiest
to
be
free
from
the
monitions
nor
leaves
the
humblest
without
the
consolation
of
a
knowledge
of
another
life
open
to
no
opportunities
of
being
tampered
with
by
the
designing
or
interested
requiring
no
extraneous
human
agency
for
its
effect
out
always
present
with
every
man
wherever
he
may
go
it
marvelously
extracts
from
vestiges
of
the
impressions
of
the
past
overwhelming
proofs
of
the
realities
of
the
future
and
gathering
its
power
from
what
would
seem
to
be
a
most
unlikely
source
it
insensibly
leads
us
no
matter
who
or
where
we
may
be
to
a
profound
belief
in
the
immortal
and
imperishable
from
phantoms
which
have
scarcely
made
their
appearance
before
they
are
ready
to
vanish
away
the
insect
differs
from
a
mere
automaton
in
this
that
it
is
influenced
by
old
by
registered
impressions
in
the
higher
forms
of
animated
life
that
registration
becomes
more
and
more
complete
memory
becomes
more
perfect
there
is
not
any
necessary
resemblance
between
an
external
form
and
its
ganglionic
impression
any
more
than
there
is
between
the
words
of
a
message
delivered
in
a
telegraphic
office
and
the
signals
which
the
telegraph
may
give
to
the
distant
station
any
more
than
there
is
between
the
letters
of
a
printed
page
and
the
acts
or
scenes
they
describe
but
the
letters
call
up
with
clearness
to
the
mind
of
the
reader
the
events
and
scenes
an
animal
without
any
apparatus
for
the
retention
of
impressions
must
be
a
pure
automaton
it
can
not
have
memory
from
insignificant
and
uncertain
beginnings
such
an
apparatus
is
gradually
evolved
and
as
its
development
advances
the
intellectual
capacity
increases
in
man
this
retention
or
registration
reaches
perfection
he
guides
himself
by
past
as
well
as
by
present
impressions
he
is
influenced
by
experience
his
conduct
is
determined
by
reason
a
most
important
advance
is
made
when
the
capability
is
acquired
by
any
animal
of
imparting
a
knowledge
of
the
impressions
stored
up
in
its
own
to
another
of
the
same
kind
this
marks
the
extension
of
individual
into
social
life
and
indeed
is
essential
thereto
in
the
higher
insects
it
is
accomplished
by
antennal
contacts
in
man
by
speech
humanity
in
its
earlier
its
savage
stages
was
limited
to
this
the
knowledge
of
one
person
could
be
transmitted
to
another
by
conversation
the
acts
and
thoughts
of
one
generation
could
be
imparted
to
another
and
influence
its
acts
and
thoughts
but
tradition
has
its
limit
the
faculty
of
speech
makes
society
possible
nothing
more
not
without
interest
do
we
remark
the
progress
of
development
of
this
function
the
invention
of
the
art
of
writing
gave
extension
and
durability
to
the
registration
or
record
of
impressions
these
which
had
hitherto
been
stored
up
in
the
brain
of
one
man
might
now
be
imparted
to
the
whole
human
race
and
be
made
to
endure
forever
civilization
became
possible
for
civilization
can
not
exist
without
writing
or
the
means
of
record
in
some
shape
from
this
psychological
point
of
view
we
perceive
the
real
significance
of
the
invention
of
printing
a
development
of
writing
which
by
increasing
the
rapidity
of
the
diffusion
of
ideas
and
insuring
their
permanence
tends
to
promote
civilization
and
to
unify
the
human
race
in
the
foregoing
paragraphs
relating
to
nervous
impressions
their
registry
and
the
consequences
that
spring
from
them
i
have
given
an
abstract
of
views
presented
in
my
work
on
human
physiology
published
in
and
may
therefore
refer
the
reader
to
the
chapter
on
inverse
vision
or
cerebral
sight
to
chapter
book
and
to
chapter
book
ii
of
that
work
for
other
particulars
the
only
path
to
scientific
human
psychology
is
through
comparative
psychology
it
is
a
long
and
wearisome
path
but
it
leads
to
truth
is
there
then
a
vast
spiritual
existence
pervading
the
universe
even
as
there
is
a
vast
existence
of
matter
pervading
it
a
spirit
which
as
a
great
german
author
tells
us
sleeps
in
the
stone
dreams
in
the
animal
awakes
in
man
does
the
soul
arise
from
the
one
as
the
body
arises
from
the
other
do
they
in
like
manner
return
each
to
the
source
from
which
it
has
come
if
so
we
can
interpret
human
existence
and
our
ideas
may
still
be
in
unison
with
scientific
truth
and
in
accord
with
our
conception
of
the
stability
the
unchangeability
of
the
universe
to
this
spiritual
existence
the
saracens
following
eastern
nations
gave
the
designation
the
active
intellect
they
believed
that
the
soul
of
man
emanated
from
it
as
a
comes
from
the
sea
and
after
a
season
returns
so
arose
among
them
the
imposing
doctrines
of
emanation
and
absorption
the
active
intellect
is
god
in
one
of
its
forms
as
we
have
seen
this
idea
was
developed
by
chakia
mouni
in
india
in
a
most
masterly
manner
and
embodied
in
the
vast
practical
system
of
buddhism
in
another
it
was
with
less
power
presented
among
the
saracens
by
averroes
but
perhaps
we
ought
rather
to
say
that
europeans
hold
averroes
as
the
author
of
this
doctrine
because
they
saw
him
isolated
from
his
antecedents
but
mohammedans
gave
him
little
credit
for
originality
he
stood
to
them
in
the
light
of
a
commentator
on
aristotle
and
as
presenting
the
opinions
of
the
alexandrian
and
other
philosophical
schools
up
to
his
time
the
following
excerpts
from
the
historical
essay
on
averroism
by
renan
will
show
how
closely
the
sarscenic
ideas
approached
those
presented
above
this
system
supposes
that
at
the
death
of
an
individual
his
intelligent
principle
or
soul
no
longer
possesses
a
separate
existence
but
returns
to
or
is
absorbed
in
the
universal
mind
the
active
intelligence
the
mundane
soul
which
is
god
from
whom
indeed
it
had
originally
emanated
or
issued
forth
the
universal
or
active
or
objective
intellect
is
uncreated
impassible
incorruptible
has
neither
beginning
nor
end
nor
does
it
increase
as
the
number
of
individual
souls
increases
it
is
altogether
separate
from
matter
it
is
as
it
were
a
cosmic
principle
this
oneness
of
the
active
intellect
or
reason
is
the
essential
principle
of
the
averroistic
theory
and
is
in
harmony
with
the
cardinal
doctrine
of
mohammedanism
the
unity
of
god
the
individual
or
passive
or
subjective
intellect
is
an
emanation
from
the
universal
and
constitutes
what
is
termed
the
soul
of
man
in
one
sense
it
is
perishable
and
ends
with
the
body
but
in
a
higher
sense
it
endures
for
after
death
it
returns
to
or
is
absorbed
in
the
universal
soul
and
thus
of
all
human
souls
there
remains
at
last
but
one
the
aggregate
of
them
all
life
is
not
the
property
of
the
individual
it
belongs
to
nature
the
end
of
man
is
to
enter
into
union
more
and
more
complete
with
the
active
intellect
reason
in
that
the
happiness
of
the
soul
consists
our
destiny
is
quietude
it
was
the
opinion
of
averroes
that
the
transition
from
the
individual
to
the
universal
is
instantaneous
at
death
but
the
buddhists
maintain
that
human
personality
continues
in
a
declining
manner
for
a
certain
term
before
nonentity
or
nirwana
is
attained
philosophy
has
never
proposed
but
two
hypotheses
to
explain
the
system
of
the
world
first
a
personal
god
existing
apart
and
a
human
soul
called
into
existence
or
created
and
thenceforth
immortal
second
an
impersonal
intelligence
or
indeterminate
god
and
a
soul
emerging
from
and
returning
to
him
as
to
the
origin
of
beings
there
are
two
opposite
opinions
first
that
they
are
created
from
nothing
second
that
they
come
by
development
from
forms
the
theory
of
creation
belongs
to
the
first
of
the
above
hypotheses
that
of
evolution
to
the
last
philosophy
among
the
arabs
thus
took
the
same
direction
that
it
had
taken
in
china
in
india
and
indeed
throughout
the
east
its
whole
spirit
depended
on
the
admission
of
the
indestructibility
of
matter
and
force
it
saw
an
analogy
between
the
gathering
of
the
material
of
which
the
body
of
man
consists
from
the
vast
store
of
matter
in
nature
and
its
final
restoration
to
that
store
and
the
emanation
of
the
spirit
of
man
from
the
universal
intellect
the
divinity
and
its
final
reabsorption
having
thus
indicated
in
sufficient
detail
the
philosophical
characteristics
of
the
doctrine
of
emanation
and
absorption
i
have
in
the
next
place
to
relate
its
history
it
was
introduced
into
europe
by
the
spanish
arabs
spain
was
the
focal
point
from
which
issuing
forth
it
affected
the
ranks
of
intelligence
and
fashion
all
over
europe
and
in
spain
it
had
a
melancholy
end
the
spanish
khalifs
had
surrounded
themselves
with
all
the
luxuries
of
oriental
life
they
had
magnificent
palaces
enchanting
gardens
seraglios
filled
with
beautiful
women
europe
at
the
present
day
does
not
offer
more
taste
more
refinement
more
elegance
than
might
have
been
seen
at
the
epoch
of
which
we
are
speaking
in
the
capitals
of
the
spanish
arabs
their
streets
were
lighted
and
solidly
paved
the
houses
were
frescoed
and
carpeted
they
were
warmed
in
winter
by
furnaces
and
cooled
in
summer
with
perfumed
air
brought
by
underground
pipes
from
they
had
baths
and
libraries
and
fountains
of
quicksilver
and
water
city
and
country
were
full
of
conviviality
and
of
dancing
to
the
lute
and
mandolin
instead
of
the
drunken
and
gluttonous
wassail
orgies
of
their
northern
neighbors
the
feasts
of
the
saracens
were
marked
by
sobriety
wine
was
prohibited
the
enchanting
moonlight
evenings
of
andalusia
were
spent
by
the
moors
in
sequestered
gardens
or
in
listening
to
the
romances
of
the
or
engaged
in
philosophical
discourse
consoling
themselves
for
the
disappointments
of
this
life
by
such
reflections
as
that
if
virtue
were
rewarded
in
this
world
we
should
be
without
expectations
in
the
life
to
come
and
reconciling
themselves
to
their
daily
toil
by
the
expectation
that
rest
will
be
found
after
death
a
rest
never
to
be
succeeded
by
labor
in
the
tenth
century
the
khalif
hakein
ii
had
made
beautiful
andalusia
the
paradise
of
the
world
christians
mussulmen
jews
mixed
together
without
restraint
there
among
many
celebrated
names
that
have
descended
to
our
times
was
gerbert
destined
subsequently
to
become
pope
there
too
was
peter
the
venerable
and
many
christian
ecclesiastics
peter
says
that
he
found
learned
men
even
from
britain
pursuing
astronomy
all
learned
men
no
matter
from
what
country
they
came
or
what
their
religious
views
were
welcomed
the
khalif
had
in
his
palace
a
manufactory
of
books
and
copyists
binders
illuminators
he
kept
in
all
the
great
cities
of
asia
and
africa
his
library
contained
four
hundred
thousand
volumes
superbly
bound
and
illuminated
throughout
the
mohammedan
dominions
in
asia
in
africa
and
in
spain
the
lower
order
of
mussulmen
entertained
a
fanatical
hatred
against
learning
among
the
more
devout
those
who
claimed
to
be
orthodox
there
were
painful
doubts
as
to
the
salvation
of
the
great
khalif
the
wicked
khalif
as
they
called
him
for
he
had
not
only
disturbed
the
people
by
introducing
the
writings
of
aristotle
and
other
greek
heathens
but
had
even
struck
at
the
existence
of
heaven
and
hell
by
saying
that
the
earth
is
a
globe
and
pretending
that
he
could
measure
its
size
these
persons
from
their
numbers
constituted
a
political
power
almansor
who
usurped
the
khalifate
to
the
prejudice
of
hakem
son
thought
that
his
usurpation
would
be
sustained
if
he
put
himself
at
the
head
of
the
orthodox
party
he
therefore
had
the
library
of
hakem
searched
and
all
works
of
a
scientific
or
philosophical
nature
carried
into
the
public
places
and
burnt
or
thrown
into
the
cisterns
of
the
palace
by
a
similar
court
revolution
averroes
in
his
old
age
he
died
was
expelled
from
spain
the
religious
party
had
triumphed
over
the
philosophical
he
was
denounced
as
a
traitor
to
religion
an
opposition
to
philosophy
had
been
organized
all
over
the
mussulman
world
there
was
hardly
a
philosopher
who
was
not
punished
some
were
put
to
death
and
the
consequence
was
that
islam
was
full
of
hypocrites
into
italy
germany
england
averroism
had
silently
made
its
way
it
found
favor
in
the
eyes
of
the
franciscans
and
a
focus
in
the
university
of
paris
by
very
many
of
the
leading
minds
it
had
been
accepted
but
at
length
the
dominicans
the
rivals
of
the
franciscans
sounded
an
alarm
they
said
it
destroys
all
personality
conducts
to
fatalism
and
renders
inexplicable
the
difference
and
progress
of
individual
intelligences
the
declaration
that
there
is
but
one
intellect
is
an
error
subversive
of
the
merits
of
the
saints
it
is
an
assertion
that
there
is
no
difference
among
men
what
is
there
no
difference
between
the
holy
soul
of
peter
and
the
damned
soul
of
judas
are
they
identical
averroes
in
this
his
blasphemous
doctrine
denies
creation
providence
revelation
the
trinity
the
efficacy
of
prayers
of
alms
and
of
litanies
he
disbelieves
in
the
resurrection
and
immortality
he
places
the
summum
bonum
in
mere
pleasure
so
too
among
the
jews
who
were
then
the
leading
intellects
of
the
world
averroism
had
been
largely
propagated
their
great
writer
maimonides
had
thoroughly
accepted
it
his
school
was
spreading
it
in
all
directions
a
furious
persecution
arose
on
the
part
of
the
orthodox
jews
of
maimonides
it
had
been
formerly
their
delight
to
declare
that
he
was
the
eagle
of
the
doctors
the
great
sage
the
glory
of
the
west
the
light
of
the
east
second
only
to
moses
now
they
proclaimed
that
he
had
abandoned
the
faith
of
abraham
had
denied
the
possibility
of
creation
believed
in
the
eternity
of
the
world
had
given
himself
up
to
the
manufacture
of
atheists
had
deprived
god
of
his
attributes
made
a
vacuum
of
him
had
declared
him
inaccessible
to
prayer
and
a
stranger
to
the
government
of
the
world
the
works
of
maimonides
were
committed
to
the
flames
by
the
synagogues
of
montpellier
barcelona
and
toledo
scarcely
had
the
conquering
arms
of
ferdinand
and
isabella
overthrown
the
arabian
dominion
in
spain
when
measures
were
taken
by
the
papacy
to
extinguish
these
opinions
which
it
was
believed
were
undermining
european
christianity
until
innocent
iv
there
was
no
special
tribunal
against
heretics
distinct
from
those
of
the
bishops
the
inquisition
then
introduced
in
accordance
with
the
centralization
of
the
times
was
a
general
and
papal
tribunal
which
displaced
the
old
local
ones
the
bishops
therefore
viewed
the
innovation
with
great
dislike
considering
it
as
an
intrusion
on
their
rights
it
was
established
in
italy
spain
germany
and
the
southern
provinces
of
france
the
temporal
sovereigns
were
only
too
desirous
to
make
use
of
this
powerful
engine
for
their
own
political
purposes
against
this
the
popes
strongly
protested
they
were
not
willing
that
its
use
should
pass
out
of
the
ecclesiastical
hand
the
inquisition
having
already
been
tried
in
the
south
of
france
had
there
proved
to
be
very
effective
for
the
suppression
of
heresy
it
had
been
introduced
into
aragon
now
was
assigned
to
it
the
duty
of
dealing
with
the
jews
in
the
old
times
under
visigothic
rule
these
people
had
greatly
prospered
but
the
leniency
that
had
been
shown
to
them
was
succeeded
by
atrocious
persecution
when
the
visigoths
abandoned
their
arianism
and
became
orthodox
the
most
inhuman
ordinances
were
issued
against
them
a
law
was
enacted
condemning
them
all
to
be
slaves
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
when
the
saracen
invasion
took
place
the
jews
did
whatever
they
could
to
promote
its
success
they
like
the
arabs
were
an
oriental
people
both
traced
their
lineage
to
abraham
their
common
ancestor
both
were
believers
in
the
unity
of
god
it
was
their
defense
of
that
doctrine
that
had
brought
upon
them
the
hatred
of
their
visigothic
masters
under
the
saracen
rule
they
were
treated
with
the
highest
consideration
they
became
distinguished
for
their
wealth
and
their
learning
for
the
most
part
they
were
aristotelians
they
founded
many
schools
and
colleges
their
mercantile
interests
led
them
to
travel
all
over
the
world
they
particularly
studied
the
science
of
medicine
throughout
the
middle
ages
they
were
the
physicians
and
bankers
of
europe
of
all
men
they
saw
the
course
of
human
affairs
from
the
most
elevated
point
of
view
among
the
special
sciences
they
became
proficient
in
mathematics
and
astronomy
they
composed
the
tables
of
alfonso
and
were
the
cause
of
the
voyage
of
de
gama
they
distinguished
themselves
greatly
in
light
literature
from
the
tenth
to
the
fourteenth
century
their
literature
was
the
first
in
europe
they
were
to
be
found
in
the
courts
of
princes
as
physicians
or
as
treasurers
managing
the
public
finances
the
orthodox
clergy
in
navarre
had
excited
popular
prejudices
against
them
to
escape
the
persecutions
that
arose
many
of
them
feigned
to
turn
christians
and
of
these
many
apostatized
to
their
former
faith
the
papal
nuncio
at
the
court
of
castile
raised
a
cry
for
the
establishment
of
the
inquisition
the
poorer
jews
were
accused
of
sacrificing
christian
children
at
the
passover
in
mockery
of
the
crucifixion
the
richer
were
denounced
as
averroists
under
the
influence
of
torquemada
a
dominican
monk
the
confessor
of
queen
isabella
that
princess
solicited
a
bull
from
the
pope
for
the
establishment
of
the
holy
office
a
bull
was
accordingly
issued
in
november
for
the
detection
and
suppression
of
heresy
in
the
first
year
of
the
operation
of
the
inquisition
two
thousand
victims
were
burnt
in
andalusia
besides
these
many
thousands
were
dug
up
from
their
graves
and
burnt
seventeen
thousand
were
fined
or
imprisoned
for
life
whoever
of
the
persecuted
race
could
flee
escaped
for
his
life
torquemada
now
appointed
for
castile
and
leon
illustrated
his
office
by
his
ferocity
anonymous
accusations
were
received
the
accused
was
not
confronted
by
witnesses
torture
was
relied
upon
for
conviction
it
was
inflicted
in
vaults
where
no
one
could
hear
the
cries
of
the
tormented
as
in
pretended
mercy
it
was
forbidden
to
inflict
torture
a
second
time
with
horrible
duplicity
it
was
affirmed
that
the
torment
had
not
been
completed
at
first
but
had
only
been
suspended
out
of
charity
until
the
following
day
the
families
of
the
convicted
were
plunged
into
irretrievable
ruin
llorente
the
historian
of
the
inquisition
computes
that
torquemada
and
his
collaborators
in
the
course
of
eighteen
years
burnt
at
the
stake
ten
thousand
two
hundred
and
twenty
persons
six
thousand
eight
hundred
and
sixty
in
effigy
and
otherwise
punished
thousand
three
hundred
and
this
frantic
priest
destroyed
hebrew
bibles
wherever
he
could
find
them
and
burnt
six
thousand
volumes
of
oriental
literature
at
salamanca
under
an
imputation
that
they
inculcated
judaism
with
unutterable
disgust
and
indignation
we
learn
that
the
papal
government
realized
much
money
by
selling
to
the
rich
dispensations
to
secure
them
from
the
inquisition
but
all
these
frightful
atrocities
proved
failures
the
conversions
were
few
torquemada
therefore
insisted
on
the
immediate
banishment
of
every
unbaptized
jew
on
march
the
edict
of
expulsion
was
signed
all
unbaptized
jews
of
whatever
age
sex
or
condition
were
ordered
to
leave
the
realm
by
the
end
of
the
following
july
if
they
revisited
it
they
should
suffer
death
they
might
sell
their
effects
and
take
the
proceeds
in
merchandise
or
bills
of
exchange
but
not
in
gold
or
silver
exiled
thus
suddenly
from
the
land
of
their
birth
the
land
of
their
ancestors
for
hundreds
of
years
they
could
not
in
the
glutted
market
that
arose
sell
what
they
possessed
nobody
would
purchase
what
could
be
got
for
nothing
after
july
the
spanish
clergy
occupied
themselves
by
preaching
in
the
public
squares
sermons
filled
with
denunciations
against
their
victims
who
when
the
time
for
expatriation
came
swarmed
in
the
roads
and
filled
the
air
with
their
cries
of
despair
even
the
spanish
onlookers
wept
at
the
scene
of
agony
torquemada
however
enforced
the
ordinance
that
no
one
should
afford
them
any
help
of
the
banished
persons
some
made
their
way
into
africa
some
into
italy
the
latter
carried
with
them
to
naples
which
destroyed
not
fewer
than
twenty
thousand
in
that
city
and
devastated
that
peninsula
some
reached
turkey
a
few
england
thousands
especially
mothers
with
nursing
children
infants
and
old
people
died
by
the
way
many
of
them
in
the
agonies
of
thirst
this
action
against
the
jews
was
soon
followed
by
one
against
the
moors
a
pragmatica
was
issued
at
seville
february
setting
forth
the
obligations
of
the
castilians
to
drive
the
enemies
of
god
from
the
land
and
ordering
that
all
unbaptized
moors
in
the
kingdoms
of
castile
and
leon
above
the
age
of
infancy
should
leave
the
country
by
the
end
of
april
they
might
sell
their
property
but
not
take
away
any
gold
or
silver
they
were
forbidden
to
emigrate
to
the
mohammedan
dominions
the
penalty
of
disobedience
was
death
their
condition
was
thus
worse
than
that
of
the
jews
who
had
been
permitted
to
go
where
they
chose
such
was
the
fiendish
intolerance
of
the
spaniards
that
they
asserted
the
government
would
be
justified
in
taking
the
lives
of
all
the
moors
for
their
shameless
infidelity
what
an
ungrateful
return
for
the
toleration
that
the
moors
in
their
day
of
power
had
given
to
the
christians
no
faith
was
kept
with
the
victims
granada
had
surrendered
under
the
solemn
guarantee
of
the
full
enjoyment
of
civil
and
religious
liberty
at
the
instigation
of
cardinal
ximenes
that
pledge
was
broken
and
after
a
residence
of
eight
centuries
the
mohammedans
were
driven
out
of
the
land
the
coexistence
of
three
religions
in
andalusia
the
christian
the
mohammedan
the
mosaic
had
given
opportunity
for
the
development
of
averroism
or
philosophical
arabism
this
was
a
repetition
of
what
had
occurred
at
rome
when
the
gods
of
all
the
conquered
countries
were
confronted
in
that
capital
and
universal
disbelief
in
them
all
ensued
averroes
himself
was
accused
of
having
been
first
a
mussulman
then
a
christian
then
a
jew
and
finally
a
misbeliever
it
was
affirmed
that
he
was
the
author
of
the
mysterious
book
de
tribus
impostoribus
in
the
middle
ages
there
were
two
celebrated
heretical
books
the
everlasting
gospel
and
the
de
tribus
impostoribus
the
latter
was
variously
imputed
to
pope
gerbert
to
frederick
and
to
averroes
in
their
unrelenting
hatred
the
dominicans
fastened
all
the
blasphemies
current
in
those
times
on
averroes
they
never
tired
of
recalling
the
celebrated
and
outrageous
one
respecting
the
eucharist
his
writings
had
first
been
generally
made
known
to
christian
europe
by
the
translation
of
michael
scot
in
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
but
long
before
his
time
the
literature
of
the
west
like
that
of
asia
was
full
of
these
ideas
we
have
seen
how
broadly
they
were
set
forth
by
erigena
the
arabians
from
their
first
cultivation
of
philosophy
had
been
infected
by
them
they
were
current
in
all
the
colleges
of
the
three
khalifates
considered
not
as
a
mode
of
thought
that
will
spontaneously
occur
to
all
men
at
a
certain
stage
of
intellectual
development
but
as
having
originated
with
aristotle
they
continually
found
favor
with
men
of
the
highest
culture
we
see
them
in
robert
grostete
in
roger
bacon
and
eventually
in
spinoza
averroes
was
not
their
inventor
he
merely
gave
them
clearness
and
expression
among
the
jews
of
the
thirteenth
century
he
had
completely
supplanted
his
imputed
master
aristotle
had
passed
away
from
their
eyes
his
great
commentator
averroes
stood
in
his
place
so
numerous
were
the
converts
to
the
doctrine
of
emanation
in
christendom
that
pope
alexander
iv
found
it
necessary
to
interfere
by
his
order
albertus
magnus
composed
a
work
against
the
unity
of
the
intellect
treating
of
the
origin
and
nature
of
the
soul
he
attempted
to
prove
that
the
theory
of
a
separate
intellect
enlightening
man
by
irradiation
anterior
to
the
individual
and
surviving
the
individual
is
a
detestable
error
but
the
most
illustrious
antagonist
of
the
great
commentator
was
thomas
aquinas
the
destroyer
of
all
such
heresies
as
the
unity
of
the
intellect
the
denial
of
providence
the
impossibility
of
creation
the
victories
of
the
angelic
doctor
were
celebrated
not
only
in
the
disputations
of
the
dominicans
but
also
in
the
works
of
art
of
the
painters
of
florence
and
pisa
the
indignation
of
that
saint
knew
no
bounds
when
christians
became
the
disciples
of
an
infidel
who
was
worse
than
a
mohammedan
the
wrath
of
the
dominicans
the
order
to
which
thomas
belonged
was
sharpened
by
the
fact
that
their
rivals
the
franciscans
inclined
to
averroistic
views
and
dante
who
leaned
to
the
dominicans
denounced
averroes
as
the
author
of
a
most
dangerous
system
the
theological
odium
of
all
three
dominant
religions
was
put
upon
him
he
was
pointed
out
as
the
originator
of
the
atrocious
maxim
that
all
religions
are
false
although
all
are
probably
useful
an
attempt
was
made
at
the
council
of
vienne
to
have
his
writings
absolutely
suppressed
and
to
forbid
all
christians
reading
them
the
dominicans
armed
with
the
weapons
of
the
inquisition
terrified
christian
europe
with
their
unrelenting
persecutions
they
imputed
all
the
infidelity
of
the
times
to
the
arabian
philosopher
but
he
was
not
without
support
in
paris
and
in
the
cities
of
northern
italy
the
franciscans
sustained
his
views
and
all
christendom
was
agitated
with
these
disputes
under
the
inspiration
of
the
dominicans
averroes
became
to
the
italian
painters
the
emblem
of
unbelief
many
of
the
italian
towns
had
pictures
or
frescoes
of
the
day
of
judgment
and
of
hell
in
these
averroes
not
unfrequently
appears
thus
in
one
at
pisa
he
figures
with
arius
mohammed
and
antichrist
in
another
he
is
represented
as
overthrown
by
thomas
he
had
become
an
essential
element
in
the
triumphs
of
the
great
dominican
doctor
he
continued
thus
to
be
familiar
to
the
italian
painters
until
the
sixteenth
century
his
doctrines
were
maintained
in
the
university
of
padua
until
the
seventeenth
such
is
in
brief
the
history
of
averroism
as
it
invaded
europe
from
spain
under
the
auspices
of
frederick
it
in
a
less
imposing
manner
issued
from
sicily
that
sovereign
bad
adopted
it
fully
in
his
sicilian
questions
he
had
demanded
light
on
the
eternity
of
the
world
and
on
the
nature
of
the
soul
and
supposed
he
had
found
it
in
the
replies
of
ibn
sabin
an
upholder
of
these
doctrines
but
in
his
conflict
with
the
papacy
be
was
overthrown
and
with
him
these
heresies
were
destroyed
in
upper
italy
averroism
long
maintained
its
ground
it
was
so
fashionable
in
high
venetian
society
that
every
gentleman
felt
constrained
to
profess
it
at
length
the
church
took
decisive
action
against
it
the
lateran
council
condemned
the
abettors
of
these
detestable
doctrines
to
be
held
as
heretics
and
infidels
as
we
have
seen
the
late
vatican
council
has
anathematized
them
notwithstanding
that
stigma
it
is
to
be
borne
in
mind
that
these
opinions
are
held
to
be
true

i
have
now
to
present
the
discussions
that
arose
respecting
the
third
great
philosophical
problem
the
nature
of
the
world
an
uncritical
observation
of
the
aspect
of
nature
persuades
us
that
the
earth
is
an
extended
level
surface
which
sustains
the
dome
of
the
sky
a
firmament
dividing
the
waters
above
from
the
waters
beneath
that
the
heavenly
bodies
the
sun
the
moon
the
stars
pursue
their
way
moving
from
east
to
west
their
insignificant
size
and
motion
round
the
motionless
earth
proclaiming
their
inferiority
of
the
various
organic
forms
surrounding
man
none
rival
him
in
dignity
and
hence
he
seems
justified
in
concluding
that
every
thing
has
been
created
for
his
use
the
sun
for
the
purpose
of
giving
him
light
by
day
the
moon
and
stars
by
night
comparative
theology
shows
us
that
this
is
the
conception
of
nature
universally
adopted
in
the
early
phase
of
intellectual
life
it
is
the
belief
of
all
nations
in
all
parts
of
the
world
in
the
beginning
of
their
civilization
geocentric
for
it
makes
the
earth
the
centre
of
the
universe
anthropocentric
for
it
makes
man
the
central
object
of
the
earth
and
not
only
is
this
the
conclusion
spontaneously
come
to
from
inconsiderate
glimpses
of
the
world
it
is
also
the
philosophical
basis
of
various
religious
revelations
vouchsafed
to
man
from
time
to
time
these
revelations
moreover
declare
to
him
that
above
the
crystalline
dome
of
the
sky
is
a
region
of
eternal
light
and
happiness
heaven
the
abode
of
god
and
the
angelic
hosts
perhaps
also
his
own
abode
after
death
and
beneath
the
earth
a
region
of
eternal
darkness
and
misery
the
habitation
of
those
that
are
evil
in
the
visible
world
is
thus
seen
a
picture
of
the
invisible
on
the
basis
of
this
view
of
the
structure
of
the
world
great
religious
systems
have
been
founded
and
hence
powerful
material
interests
have
been
engaged
in
its
support
these
have
resisted
sometimes
by
resorting
to
bloodshed
attempts
that
have
been
made
to
correct
its
incontestable
errors
a
resistance
grounded
on
the
suspicion
that
the
localization
of
heaven
and
hell
and
the
supreme
value
of
man
in
the
universe
might
be
affected
that
such
attempts
would
be
made
was
inevitable
as
soon
as
men
began
to
reason
on
the
subject
at
all
they
could
not
fail
to
discredit
the
assertion
that
the
earth
is
an
indefinite
plane
no
one
can
doubt
that
the
sun
we
see
is
the
sun
that
we
saw
yesterday
his
reappearance
each
morning
irresistibly
suggests
that
he
has
passed
on
the
underside
of
the
earth
but
this
is
incompatible
with
the
reign
of
night
in
those
regions
it
presents
more
or
less
distinctly
the
idea
of
the
globular
form
of
the
earth
the
earth
can
not
extend
indefinitely
downward
for
the
sun
can
not
go
through
it
nor
through
any
crevice
or
passage
in
it
since
he
rises
and
sets
in
different
positions
at
different
seasons
of
the
year
the
stars
also
move
under
it
in
countless
courses
there
must
therefore
be
a
clear
way
beneath
to
reconcile
revelation
with
these
innovating
facts
schemes
such
as
that
of
cosmas
indicopleustes
in
his
christian
topography
were
doubtless
often
adopted
to
this
in
particular
we
have
had
occasion
on
a
former
page
to
refer
it
asserted
that
in
the
northern
parts
of
the
flat
earth
there
is
an
immense
mountain
behind
which
the
sun
passes
and
thus
produces
night
at
a
very
remote
historical
period
the
mechanism
of
eclipses
had
been
discovered
those
of
the
moon
demonstrated
that
the
shadow
of
the
earth
is
always
circular
the
form
of
the
earth
must
therefore
be
globular
a
body
which
in
all
positions
casts
a
circular
shadow
must
itself
be
spherical
other
considerations
with
which
every
one
is
now
familiar
could
not
fail
to
establish
that
such
is
her
figure
but
the
determination
of
the
shape
of
the
earth
by
no
means
deposed
her
from
her
position
of
superiority
apparently
vastly
larger
than
all
other
things
it
was
fitting
that
she
should
be
considered
not
merely
as
the
centre
of
the
world
but
in
truth
as
the
world
all
other
objects
in
their
aggregate
seemed
utterly
unimportant
in
comparison
with
her
though
the
consequences
flowing
from
an
admission
of
the
globular
figure
of
the
earth
affected
very
profoundly
existing
theological
ideas
they
were
of
much
less
moment
than
those
depending
on
a
determination
of
her
size
it
needed
but
an
elementary
knowledge
of
geometry
to
perceive
that
correct
ideas
on
this
point
could
be
readily
obtained
by
measuring
a
degree
on
her
surface
probably
there
were
early
attempts
to
accomplish
this
object
the
results
of
which
have
been
lost
but
eratosthenes
executed
one
between
syene
and
alexandria
in
egypt
syene
being
supposed
to
be
exactly
under
the
tropic
of
cancer
the
two
places
are
however
not
on
the
same
meridian
and
the
distance
between
them
was
estimated
not
measured
two
centuries
later
posidonius
made
another
attempt
between
alexandria
and
rhodes
the
bright
star
canopus
just
grazed
the
horizon
at
the
latter
place
at
alexandria
it
rose
degrees
in
this
instance
also
since
the
direction
lay
across
the
sea
the
distance
was
estimated
not
measured
finally
as
we
have
already
related
the
khalif
made
two
sets
of
measures
one
on
the
shore
of
the
red
sea
the
other
near
cufa
in
mesopotamia
the
general
result
of
these
various
observations
gave
for
the
earth
diameter
between
seven
and
eight
thousand
miles
this
approximate
determination
of
the
size
of
the
earth
tended
to
depose
her
from
her
dominating
position
and
gave
rise
to
very
serious
theological
results
in
this
the
ancient
investigations
of
aristarchus
of
samos
one
of
the
alexandrian
school
powerfully
aided
in
his
treatise
on
the
magnitudes
and
distances
of
the
sun
and
moon
he
explains
the
ingenious
though
imperfect
method
to
which
he
had
resorted
for
the
solution
of
that
problem
many
ages
previously
a
speculation
had
been
brought
from
india
to
europe
by
pythagoras
it
presented
the
sun
as
the
centre
of
the
system
around
him
the
planets
revolved
in
circular
orbits
their
order
of
position
being
mercury
venus
earth
mars
jupiter
saturn
each
of
them
being
supposed
to
rotate
on
its
axis
as
it
revolved
round
the
sun
according
to
cicero
nicetas
suggested
that
if
it
were
admitted
that
the
earth
revolves
on
her
axis
the
difficulty
presented
by
the
inconceivable
velocity
of
the
heavens
would
be
avoided
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
works
of
aristarchus
in
the
alexandrian
library
were
burnt
at
the
time
of
the
fire
of
caesar
the
only
treatise
of
his
that
has
come
down
to
us
is
that
above
mentioned
on
the
size
and
distance
of
the
sun
and
moon
aristarchus
adopted
the
pythagorean
system
as
representing
the
actual
facts
this
was
the
result
of
a
recognition
of
the
sun
amazing
distance
and
therefore
of
his
enormous
size
the
heliocentric
system
thus
regarding
the
sun
as
the
central
orb
degraded
the
earth
to
a
very
subordinate
rank
making
her
only
one
of
a
company
of
six
revolving
bodies
but
this
is
not
the
only
contribution
conferred
on
astronomy
by
aristarchus
for
considering
that
the
movement
of
the
earth
does
not
sensibly
affect
the
apparent
position
of
the
stars
he
inferred
that
they
are
incomparably
more
distant
from
us
than
the
sun
he
therefore
of
all
the
ancients
as
laplace
remarks
had
the
most
correct
ideas
of
the
grandeur
of
the
universe
he
saw
that
the
earth
is
of
absolutely
insignificant
size
when
compared
with
the
stellar
distances
he
saw
too
that
there
is
nothing
above
us
but
space
and
stars
but
the
views
of
aristarchus
as
respects
the
emplacement
of
the
planetary
bodies
were
not
accepted
by
antiquity
the
system
proposed
by
ptolemy
and
incorporated
in
his
syntaxis
was
universally
preferred
the
physical
philosophy
of
those
times
was
very
imperfect
one
of
ptolemy
objections
to
the
pythagorean
system
being
that
if
the
earth
were
in
motion
it
would
leave
the
air
and
other
light
bodies
behind
it
he
therefore
placed
the
earth
in
the
central
position
and
in
succession
revolved
round
her
the
moon
mercury
venus
the
sun
mars
jupiter
saturn
beyond
the
orbit
of
saturn
came
the
firmament
of
the
fixed
stars
as
to
the
solid
crystalline
spheres
one
moving
from
east
to
west
the
other
from
north
to
south
these
were
a
fancy
of
eudoxus
to
which
ptolemy
does
not
allude
the
ptolemaic
system
is
therefore
essentially
a
geocentric
system
it
left
the
earth
in
her
position
of
superiority
and
hence
gave
no
cause
of
umbrage
to
religious
opinions
christian
or
mohammedan
the
immense
reputation
of
its
author
the
signal
ability
of
his
great
work
on
the
mechanism
of
the
heavens
sustained
it
for
almost
fourteen
hundred
years
that
is
from
the
second
to
the
sixteenth
century
in
christendom
the
greater
part
of
this
long
period
was
consumed
in
disputes
respecting
the
nature
of
god
and
in
struggles
for
ecclesiastical
power
the
authority
of
the
fathers
and
the
prevailing
belief
that
the
scriptures
contain
the
sum
of
all
knowledge
discouraged
any
investigation
of
nature
if
by
chance
a
passing
interest
was
taken
in
some
astronomical
question
it
was
at
once
settled
by
a
reference
to
such
authorities
as
the
writings
of
augustine
or
lactantius
not
by
an
appeal
to
the
phenomena
of
the
heavens
so
great
was
the
preference
given
to
sacred
over
profane
learning
that
christianity
had
been
in
existence
fifteen
hundred
years
and
had
not
produced
a
single
astronomer
the
mohammedan
nations
did
much
better
their
cultivation
of
science
dates
from
the
capture
of
alexandria
this
was
only
six
years
after
the
death
of
the
prophet
in
less
than
two
centuries
they
had
not
only
become
acquainted
with
but
correctly
appreciated
the
greek
scientific
writers
as
we
have
already
mentioned
by
his
treaty
with
michael
the
khalif
had
obtained
a
copy
of
the
syntaxis
of
ptolemy
he
had
it
forthwith
translated
into
arabic
it
became
at
once
the
great
authority
of
saracen
astronomy
from
this
basis
the
saracens
had
advanced
to
the
solution
of
some
of
the
most
important
scientific
problems
they
had
ascertained
the
dimensions
of
the
earth
they
had
registered
or
catalogued
all
the
stars
visible
in
their
heavens
giving
to
those
of
the
larger
magnitudes
the
names
they
still
bear
on
our
maps
and
globes
they
determined
the
true
length
of
the
year
discovered
astronomical
refraction
invented
the
improved
the
photometry
of
the
stars
ascertained
the
curvilinear
path
of
a
ray
of
light
through
the
air
explained
the
phenomena
of
the
horizontal
sun
and
moon
and
why
we
see
those
bodies
before
they
have
risen
and
after
they
have
set
measured
the
height
of
the
atmosphere
determining
it
to
be
miles
given
the
true
theory
of
the
twilight
and
of
the
twinkling
of
the
stars
they
had
built
the
first
observatory
in
europe
so
accurate
were
they
in
their
observations
that
the
ablest
modern
mathematicians
have
made
use
of
their
results
thus
laplace
in
his
systeme
du
monde
adduces
the
observations
of
as
affording
incontestable
proof
of
the
diminution
of
the
eccentricity
of
the
earth
orbit
he
uses
those
of
in
his
discussion
of
the
obliquity
of
the
ecliptic
and
also
in
the
case
of
the
problems
of
the
greater
inequalities
of
jupiter
and
saturn
these
represent
but
a
part
and
indeed
but
a
small
part
of
the
services
rendered
by
the
arabian
astronomers
in
the
solution
of
the
problem
of
the
nature
of
the
world
meanwhile
such
was
the
benighted
condition
of
christendom
such
its
deplorable
ignorance
that
it
cared
nothing
about
the
matter
its
attention
was
engrossed
by
transubstantiation
the
merits
of
the
saints
miracles
this
indifference
continued
until
the
close
of
the
fifteenth
century
even
then
there
was
no
scientific
inducement
the
inciting
motives
were
altogether
of
a
different
kind
they
originated
in
commercial
rivalries
and
the
question
of
the
shape
of
the
earth
was
finally
settled
by
three
sailors
columbus
de
gama
and
above
all
by
ferdinand
magellan
the
trade
of
eastern
asia
has
always
been
a
source
of
immense
wealth
to
the
western
nations
who
in
succession
have
obtained
it
in
the
middle
ages
it
had
centred
in
upper
italy
it
was
conducted
along
two
lines
a
northern
by
way
of
the
black
and
caspian
seas
and
beyond
the
headquarters
of
this
were
at
genoa
and
a
southern
through
the
syrian
and
egyptian
ports
and
by
the
arabian
sea
the
headquarters
of
this
being
at
venice
the
merchants
engaged
in
the
latter
traffic
had
also
made
great
gains
in
the
transport
service
of
the
the
venetians
had
managed
to
maintain
amicable
relations
with
the
mohammedan
powers
of
syria
and
egypt
they
were
permitted
to
have
consulates
at
alexandria
and
damascus
and
notwithstanding
the
military
commotions
of
which
those
countries
had
been
the
scene
the
trade
was
still
maintained
in
a
comparatively
flourishing
condition
but
the
northern
or
genoese
line
had
been
completely
broken
up
by
the
irruptions
of
the
tartars
and
the
turks
and
the
military
and
political
disturbances
of
the
countries
through
which
it
passed
the
eastern
trade
of
genoa
was
not
merely
in
a
precarious
condition
it
was
on
the
brink
of
destruction
the
circular
visible
horizon
and
its
dip
at
sea
the
gradual
appearance
and
disappearance
of
ships
in
the
offing
can
not
fail
to
incline
intelligent
sailors
to
a
belief
in
the
globular
figure
of
the
earth
the
writings
of
the
mohammedan
astronomers
and
philosophers
had
given
currency
to
that
doctrine
throughout
western
europe
but
as
might
be
expected
it
was
received
with
disfavor
by
theologians
when
genoa
was
thus
on
the
very
brink
of
ruin
it
occurred
to
some
of
her
mariners
that
if
this
view
were
correct
her
affairs
might
be
a
ship
sailing
through
the
straits
of
gibraltar
westward
across
the
atlantic
would
not
fail
to
reach
the
east
indies
there
were
apparently
other
great
advantages
heavy
cargoes
might
be
transported
without
tedious
and
expensive
and
without
breaking
bulk
among
the
genoese
sailors
who
entertained
these
views
was
christopher
columbus
he
tells
us
that
his
attention
was
drawn
to
this
subject
by
the
writings
of
averroes
but
among
his
friends
he
numbered
toscanelli
a
florentine
who
had
turned
his
attention
to
astronomy
and
had
become
a
strong
advocate
of
the
globular
form
in
genoa
itself
columbus
met
with
but
little
encouragement
he
then
spent
many
years
in
trying
to
interest
different
princes
in
his
proposed
attempt
its
irreligious
tendency
was
pointed
out
by
the
spanish
ecclesiastics
and
condemned
by
the
council
of
salamanca
its
orthodoxy
was
confuted
from
the
pentateuch
the
psalms
the
prophecies
the
gospels
the
epistles
and
the
writings
of
the
fathers
chrysostom
augustine
jerome
gregory
st
basil
st
ambrose
at
length
however
encouraged
by
the
spanish
queen
isabella
and
substantially
aided
by
a
wealthy
seafaring
family
the
pinzons
of
palos
some
of
whom
joined
him
personally
he
sailed
on
august
with
three
small
ships
from
palos
carrying
with
him
a
letter
from
king
ferdinand
to
the
of
tartary
and
also
a
chart
or
map
constructed
on
the
basis
of
that
of
toscanelli
a
little
before
midnight
october
he
saw
from
the
forecastle
of
his
ship
a
moving
light
at
a
distance
two
hours
subsequently
a
from
another
of
the
ships
announced
that
they
had
descried
land
at
sunrise
columbus
landed
in
the
new
world
on
his
return
to
europe
it
was
universally
supposed
that
he
had
reached
the
eastern
parts
of
asia
and
that
therefore
his
voyage
had
been
theoretically
successful
columbus
himself
died
in
that
belief
but
numerous
voyages
which
were
soon
undertaken
made
known
the
general
contour
of
the
american
and
the
discovery
of
the
great
south
sea
by
balboa
revealed
at
length
the
true
facts
of
the
case
and
the
mistake
into
which
both
toscanelli
and
columbus
had
fallen
that
in
a
voyage
to
the
west
the
distance
from
europe
to
asia
could
not
exceed
the
distance
passed
over
in
a
voyage
from
italy
to
the
gulf
of
guinea
a
voyage
that
columbus
had
repeatedly
made
in
his
first
voyage
at
nightfall
on
september
being
then
two
and
a
half
degrees
east
of
corvo
one
of
the
azores
columbus
observed
that
the
compass
needles
of
the
ships
no
longer
pointed
a
little
to
the
east
of
north
but
were
varying
to
the
west
the
deviation
became
more
and
more
marked
as
the
expedition
advanced
he
was
not
the
first
to
detect
the
fact
of
variation
but
he
was
incontestably
the
first
to
discover
the
line
of
no
variation
on
the
the
reverse
was
observed
the
variation
westward
diminished
until
the
meridian
in
question
was
reached
when
the
needles
again
pointed
due
north
thence
as
the
coast
of
europe
was
approached
the
variation
was
to
the
east
columbus
therefore
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
line
of
no
variation
was
a
fixed
geographical
line
or
boundary
between
the
eastern
and
western
hemispheres
in
the
bull
of
may
pope
alexander
vi
accordingly
adopted
this
line
as
the
perpetual
boundary
between
the
possessions
of
spain
and
portugal
in
his
settlement
of
the
disputes
of
those
nations
subsequently
however
it
was
discovered
that
the
line
was
moving
eastward
it
coincided
with
the
meridian
of
london
in
by
the
papal
bull
the
portuguese
possessions
were
limited
to
the
east
of
the
line
of
no
variation
information
derived
from
certain
egyptian
jews
had
reached
that
government
that
it
was
possible
to
sail
round
the
continent
of
africa
there
being
at
its
extreme
south
a
cape
which
could
be
easily
doubled
an
expedition
of
three
ships
under
vasco
de
gama
set
sail
july
it
doubled
the
cape
on
november
and
reached
calicut
on
the
coast
of
india
may
under
the
bull
this
voyage
to
the
east
gave
to
the
portuguese
the
right
to
the
india
trade
until
the
cape
was
doubled
the
course
of
de
gama
ships
was
in
a
general
manner
southward
very
soon
it
was
noticed
that
the
elevation
of
the
above
the
horizon
was
diminishing
and
soon
after
the
equator
was
reached
that
star
had
ceased
to
be
visible
meantime
other
stars
some
of
them
forming
magnificent
constellations
had
come
into
view
the
stars
of
the
southern
hemisphere
all
this
was
in
conformity
to
theoretical
expectations
founded
on
the
admission
of
the
globular
form
of
the
earth
the
political
consequences
that
at
once
ensued
placed
the
papal
government
in
a
position
of
great
embarrassment
its
traditions
and
policy
forbade
it
to
admit
any
other
than
the
flat
figure
of
the
earth
as
revealed
in
the
scriptures
concealment
of
the
facts
was
impossible
sophistry
was
unavailing
commercial
prosperity
now
left
venice
as
well
as
genoa
the
front
of
europe
was
changed
maritime
power
had
departed
from
the
mediterranean
countries
and
passed
to
those
upon
the
atlantic
coast
but
the
spanish
government
did
not
submit
to
the
advantage
thus
gained
by
its
commercial
rival
without
an
effort
it
listened
to
the
representations
of
one
ferdinand
magellan
that
india
and
the
spice
islands
could
be
reached
by
sailing
to
the
west
if
only
a
strait
or
passage
through
what
had
now
been
recognized
as
the
american
continent
could
be
discovered
and
if
this
should
be
accomplished
spain
under
the
papal
bull
would
have
as
good
a
right
to
the
india
trade
as
portugal
under
the
command
of
magellan
an
expedition
of
five
ships
carrying
two
hundred
and
men
was
dispatched
from
seville
august
magellan
at
once
struck
boldly
for
the
south
american
coast
hoping
to
find
some
cleft
or
passage
through
the
continent
by
which
he
might
reach
the
great
south
sea
for
seventy
days
he
was
becalmed
on
the
line
his
sailors
were
appalled
by
the
apprehension
that
they
had
drifted
into
a
region
where
the
winds
never
blew
and
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
escape
calms
tempests
mutiny
desertion
could
not
shake
his
resolution
after
more
than
a
year
he
discovered
the
strait
which
now
bears
his
name
and
as
pigafetti
an
italian
who
was
with
him
relates
he
shed
fears
of
joy
when
he
found
that
it
had
pleased
god
at
length
to
bring
him
where
he
might
grapple
with
the
unknown
dangers
of
the
south
sea
the
great
and
pacific
ocean
driven
by
famine
to
eat
scraps
of
skin
and
leather
with
which
his
rigging
was
here
and
there
bound
to
drink
water
that
had
gone
putrid
his
crew
dying
of
hunger
and
scurvy
this
man
firm
in
his
belief
of
the
globular
figure
of
the
earth
steered
steadily
to
the
northwest
and
for
nearly
four
months
never
saw
inhabited
land
he
estimated
that
he
had
sailed
over
the
pacific
not
less
than
twelve
thousand
miles
he
crossed
the
equator
saw
once
more
the
and
at
length
made
land
the
ladrones
here
he
met
with
adventurers
from
sumatra
among
these
islands
he
was
killed
either
by
the
savages
or
by
his
own
men
his
lieutenant
sebastian
now
took
command
of
the
ship
directing
her
course
for
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
encountering
frightful
hardships
he
doubled
the
cape
at
last
and
then
for
the
fourth
time
crossed
the
equator
on
september
after
a
voyage
of
more
than
three
years
he
brought
his
ship
the
san
vittoria
to
anchor
in
the
port
of
lucar
near
seville
she
had
accomplished
the
greatest
achievement
in
the
history
of
the
human
race
she
had
circumnavigated
the
earth
the
san
vittoria
sailing
westward
had
come
back
to
her
henceforth
the
theological
doctrine
of
the
flatness
of
the
earth
was
irretrievably
overthrown
five
years
after
the
completion
of
the
voyage
of
magellan
was
made
the
first
attempt
in
christendom
to
ascertain
the
size
of
the
earth
this
was
by
fernel
a
french
physician
who
having
observed
the
height
of
the
pole
at
paris
went
thence
northward
until
he
came
to
a
place
where
the
height
of
the
pole
was
exactly
one
degree
more
than
at
that
city
he
measured
the
distance
between
the
two
stations
by
the
number
of
revolutions
of
one
of
the
wheels
of
his
carriage
to
which
a
proper
indicator
bad
been
attached
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
circumference
is
about
thousand
four
hundred
and
eighty
italian
miles
measures
executed
more
and
more
carefully
were
made
in
many
countries
by
snell
in
holland
by
norwood
between
london
and
york
in
england
by
picard
under
the
auspices
of
the
french
academy
of
sciences
in
france
picard
plan
was
to
connect
two
points
by
a
series
of
triangles
and
thus
ascertaining
the
length
of
the
arc
of
a
meridian
intercepted
between
them
to
compare
it
with
the
difference
of
latitudes
found
from
celestial
observations
the
stations
were
malvoisine
in
the
vicinity
of
paris
and
sourdon
near
amiens
the
difference
of
latitudes
was
determined
by
observing
the
of
delta
cassiopeia
there
are
two
points
of
interest
connected
with
picard
operation
it
was
the
first
in
which
instruments
furnished
with
telescopes
were
employed
and
its
result
as
we
shall
shortly
see
was
to
newton
the
first
confirmation
of
the
theory
of
universal
gravitation
at
this
time
it
had
become
clear
from
mechanical
considerations
more
especially
such
as
had
been
deduced
by
newton
that
since
the
earth
is
a
rotating
body
her
form
can
not
be
that
of
a
perfect
sphere
but
must
be
that
of
a
spheroid
oblate
or
flattened
at
the
poles
it
would
follow
from
this
that
the
length
of
a
degree
must
be
greater
near
the
poles
than
at
the
equator
the
french
academy
resolved
to
extend
picard
operation
by
prolonging
the
measures
in
each
direction
and
making
the
result
the
basis
of
a
more
accurate
map
of
france
delays
however
took
place
and
it
was
not
until
that
the
measures
from
dunkirk
on
the
north
to
the
southern
extremity
of
france
were
completed
a
discussion
arose
as
to
the
interpretation
of
these
measures
some
affirming
that
they
indicated
a
prolate
others
an
oblate
spheroid
the
former
figure
may
be
popularly
represented
by
a
lemon
the
latter
by
an
orange
to
settle
this
the
french
government
aided
by
the
academy
sent
out
two
expeditions
to
measure
degrees
of
the
meridian
one
under
the
equator
the
other
as
far
north
as
possible
the
former
went
to
peru
the
latter
to
swedish
lapland
very
great
difficulties
were
encountered
by
both
parties
the
lapland
commission
however
completed
its
observations
long
before
the
peruvian
which
consumed
not
less
than
nine
years
the
results
of
the
measures
thus
obtained
confirmed
the
theoretical
expectation
of
the
oblate
form
since
that
time
many
extensive
and
exact
repetitions
of
the
observation
have
been
made
among
which
may
be
mentioned
those
of
the
english
in
england
and
in
india
and
particularly
that
of
the
french
on
the
occasion
of
the
introduction
of
the
metric
system
of
weights
and
measures
it
was
begun
by
delambre
and
mechain
from
dunkirk
to
barcelona
and
thence
extended
by
biot
and
arago
to
the
island
of
formentera
near
minorea
its
length
was
nearly
twelve
and
a
half
degrees
besides
this
method
of
direct
measurement
the
figure
of
the
earth
may
be
determined
from
the
observed
number
of
oscillations
made
by
a
pendulum
of
invariable
length
in
different
latitudes
these
though
they
confirm
the
foregoing
results
give
a
somewhat
greater
ellipticity
to
the
earth
than
that
found
by
the
measurement
of
degrees
pendulums
vibrate
more
slowly
the
nearer
they
are
to
the
equator
it
follows
therefore
that
they
are
there
farther
from
the
centre
of
the
earth
from
the
most
reliable
measures
that
have
been
made
the
dimensions
of
the
earth
may
be
thus
stated
greater
or
equatorial
diameter
miles
less
or
polar
diameter
difference
or
polar
compression
such
was
the
result
of
the
discussion
respecting
the
figure
and
size
of
the
earth
while
it
was
yet
undetermined
another
controversy
arose
fraught
with
even
more
serious
consequences
this
was
the
conflict
respecting
the
earth
position
with
regard
to
the
sun
and
the
planetary
bodies
copernicus
a
prussian
about
the
year
had
completed
a
book
on
the
revolutions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
he
had
journeyed
to
italy
in
his
youth
had
devoted
his
attention
to
astronomy
and
had
taught
mathematics
at
rome
from
a
profound
study
of
the
ptolemaic
and
pythagorean
systems
he
had
come
to
a
conclusion
in
favor
of
the
latter
the
object
of
his
book
being
to
sustain
it
aware
that
his
doctrines
were
totally
opposed
to
revealed
truth
and
foreseeing
that
they
would
bring
upon
him
the
punishments
of
the
church
he
expressed
himself
in
a
cautious
and
apologetic
manner
saying
that
he
had
only
taken
the
liberty
of
trying
whether
on
the
supposition
of
the
earth
motion
it
was
possible
to
find
better
explanations
than
the
ancient
ones
of
the
revolutions
of
the
celestial
orbs
that
in
doing
this
he
had
only
taken
the
privilege
that
had
been
allowed
to
others
of
feigning
what
hypothesis
they
chose
the
preface
was
addressed
to
pope
paul
iii
full
of
misgivings
as
to
what
might
be
the
result
he
refrained
from
publishing
his
book
for
years
thinking
that
perhaps
it
might
be
better
to
follow
the
examples
of
the
pythagoreans
and
others
who
delivered
their
doctrine
only
by
tradition
and
to
friends
at
the
entreaty
of
cardinal
schomberg
he
at
length
published
it
in
a
copy
of
it
was
brought
to
him
on
his
its
fate
was
such
as
he
had
anticipated
the
inquisition
condemned
it
as
heretical
in
their
decree
prohibiting
it
the
congregation
of
the
index
denounced
his
system
as
that
false
pythagorean
doctrine
utterly
contrary
to
the
holy
scriptures
astronomers
justly
affirm
that
the
book
of
copernicus
de
revolutionibus
changed
the
face
of
their
science
it
incontestably
established
the
heliocentric
theory
it
showed
that
the
distance
of
the
fixed
stars
is
infinitely
great
and
that
the
earth
is
a
mere
point
in
the
heavens
anticipating
newton
copernicus
imputed
gravity
to
the
sun
the
moon
and
heavenly
bodies
but
he
was
led
astray
by
assuming
that
the
celestial
motions
must
be
circular
observations
on
the
orbit
of
mars
and
his
different
diameters
at
different
times
had
led
copernicus
to
his
theory
in
thus
denouncing
the
copernican
system
as
being
in
contradiction
to
revelation
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
were
doubtless
deeply
moved
by
inferential
considerations
to
dethrone
the
earth
from
her
central
dominating
position
to
give
her
many
equals
and
not
a
few
superiors
seemed
to
diminish
her
claims
upon
the
divine
regard
if
each
of
the
countless
myriads
of
stars
was
a
sun
surrounded
by
revolving
globes
peopled
with
responsible
beings
like
ourselves
if
we
had
fallen
so
easily
and
had
been
redeemed
at
so
stupendous
a
price
as
the
death
of
the
son
of
god
how
was
it
with
them
of
them
were
there
none
who
had
fallen
or
might
fall
like
us
where
then
for
them
could
a
savior
be
found
during
the
year
one
lippershey
a
hollander
discovered
that
by
looking
through
two
glass
lenses
combined
in
a
certain
manner
together
distant
objects
were
magnified
and
rendered
very
plain
he
had
invented
the
telescope
in
the
following
year
galileo
a
florentine
greatly
distinguished
by
his
mathematical
and
scientific
writings
hearing
of
the
circumstance
but
without
knowing
the
particulars
of
the
construction
invented
a
form
of
the
instrument
for
himself
improving
it
gradually
he
succeeded
in
making
one
that
could
magnify
thirty
times
examining
the
moon
he
found
that
she
had
valleys
like
those
of
the
earth
and
mountains
casting
shadows
it
had
been
said
in
the
old
times
that
in
the
pleiades
there
were
formerly
seven
stars
but
a
legend
related
that
one
of
them
had
mysteriously
disappeared
on
turning
his
telescope
toward
them
galileo
found
that
he
could
easily
count
not
fewer
than
forty
in
whatever
direction
he
looked
he
discovered
stars
that
were
totally
invisible
to
the
naked
eye
on
the
night
of
january
he
perceived
three
small
stars
in
a
straight
line
adjacent
to
the
planet
jupiter
and
a
few
evenings
later
a
fourth
he
found
that
these
were
revolving
in
orbits
round
the
body
of
the
planet
and
with
transport
recognized
that
they
presented
a
miniature
representation
of
the
copernican
system
the
announcement
of
these
wonders
at
once
attracted
universal
attention
the
spiritual
authorities
were
not
slow
to
detect
their
tendency
as
endangering
the
doctrine
that
the
universe
was
made
for
man
in
the
creation
of
myriads
of
stars
hitherto
invisible
there
must
surely
have
been
some
other
motive
than
that
of
illuminating
the
nights
for
him
it
had
been
objected
to
the
copernican
theory
that
if
the
planets
mercury
and
venus
move
round
the
sun
in
orbits
interior
to
that
of
the
earth
they
ought
to
show
phases
like
those
of
the
moon
and
that
in
the
case
of
venus
which
is
so
brilliant
and
conspicuous
these
phases
should
be
very
obvious
copernicus
himself
had
admitted
the
force
of
the
objection
and
had
vainly
tried
to
find
an
explanation
galileo
on
turning
his
telescope
to
the
planet
discovered
that
the
expected
phases
actually
exist
now
she
was
a
crescent
then
then
gibbous
then
full
previously
to
copernicus
it
was
supposed
that
the
planets
shine
by
their
own
light
but
the
phases
of
venus
and
mars
proved
that
their
light
is
reflected
the
aristotelian
notion
that
celestial
differ
from
terrestrial
bodies
in
being
incorruptible
received
a
rude
shock
from
the
discoveries
of
galileo
that
there
are
mountains
and
valleys
in
the
moon
like
those
of
the
earth
that
the
sun
is
not
perfect
but
has
spots
on
his
face
and
that
he
turns
on
his
axis
instead
of
being
in
a
state
of
majestic
rest
the
apparition
of
new
stars
had
already
thrown
serious
doubts
on
this
theory
of
incorruptibility
these
and
many
other
beautiful
telescopic
discoveries
tended
to
the
establishment
of
the
truth
of
the
copernican
theory
and
gave
unbounded
alarm
to
the
church
by
the
low
and
ignorant
ecclesiastics
they
were
denounced
as
deceptions
or
frauds
some
affirmed
that
the
telescope
might
be
relied
on
well
enough
for
terrestrial
objects
but
with
the
heavenly
bodies
it
was
altogether
a
different
affair
others
declared
that
its
invention
was
a
mere
application
of
aristotle
remark
that
stars
could
be
seen
in
the
daytime
from
the
bottom
of
a
deep
well
galileo
was
accused
of
imposture
heresy
blasphemy
atheism
with
a
view
of
defending
himself
he
addressed
a
letter
to
the
abbe
castelli
suggesting
that
the
scriptures
were
never
intended
to
be
a
scientific
authority
but
only
a
moral
guide
this
made
matters
worse
he
was
summoned
before
the
holy
inquisition
under
an
accusation
of
having
taught
that
the
earth
moves
round
the
sun
a
doctrine
utterly
contrary
to
the
scriptures
he
was
ordered
to
renounce
that
heresy
on
pain
of
being
imprisoned
he
was
directed
to
desist
from
teaching
and
advocating
the
copernican
theory
and
pledge
himself
that
he
would
neither
publish
nor
defend
it
for
the
future
knowing
well
that
truth
has
no
need
of
martyrs
he
assented
to
the
required
recantation
and
gave
the
promise
demanded
for
sixteen
years
the
church
had
rest
but
in
galileo
ventured
on
the
publication
of
his
work
entitled
the
system
of
the
world
its
object
being
the
vindication
of
the
copernican
doctrine
he
was
again
summoned
before
the
inquisition
at
rome
accused
of
having
asserted
that
the
earth
moves
round
the
sun
he
was
declared
to
have
brought
upon
himself
the
penalties
of
heresy
on
his
knees
with
his
hand
on
the
bible
he
was
compelled
to
abjure
and
curse
the
doctrine
of
the
movement
of
the
earth
what
a
spectacle
this
venerable
man
the
most
illustrious
of
his
age
forced
by
the
threat
of
death
to
deny
facts
which
his
judges
as
well
as
himself
knew
to
be
true
he
was
then
committed
to
prison
treated
with
remorseless
severity
during
the
remaining
ten
years
of
his
life
and
was
denied
burial
in
consecrated
ground
must
not
that
be
false
which
requires
for
its
support
so
much
imposture
so
much
barbarity
the
opinions
thus
defended
by
the
inquisition
are
now
objects
of
derision
to
the
whole
civilized
world
one
of
the
greatest
of
modern
mathematicians
referring
to
this
subject
says
that
the
point
here
contested
was
one
which
is
for
mankind
of
the
highest
interest
because
of
the
rank
it
assigns
to
the
globe
that
we
inhabit
if
the
earth
be
immovable
in
the
midst
of
the
universe
man
has
a
right
to
regard
himself
as
the
principal
object
of
the
care
of
nature
but
if
the
earth
be
only
one
of
the
planets
revolving
round
the
sun
an
insignificant
body
in
the
solar
system
she
will
disappear
entirely
in
the
immensity
of
the
heavens
in
which
this
system
vast
as
it
may
appear
to
us
is
nothing
but
an
insensible
point
the
triumphant
establishment
of
the
copernican
doctrine
dates
from
the
invention
of
the
telescope
soon
there
was
not
to
be
found
in
all
europe
an
astronomer
who
had
not
accepted
the
heliocentric
theory
with
its
essential
postulate
the
double
motion
of
the
earth
movement
of
rotation
on
her
axis
and
a
movement
of
revolution
round
the
sun
if
additional
proof
of
the
latter
were
needed
it
was
furnished
by
bradley
great
discovery
of
the
aberration
of
the
fixed
stars
an
aberration
depending
partly
on
the
progressive
motion
of
light
and
partly
on
the
revolution
of
the
earth
bradley
discovery
ranked
in
importance
with
that
of
the
precession
of
the
equinoxes
discovery
of
the
progressive
motion
of
light
though
denounced
by
fontenelle
as
a
seductive
error
and
not
admitted
by
cassini
at
length
forced
its
way
to
universal
acceptance
next
it
was
necessary
to
obtain
correct
ideas
of
the
dimensions
of
the
solar
system
or
putting
the
problem
under
a
more
limited
form
to
determine
the
distance
of
the
earth
from
the
sun
in
the
time
of
copernicus
it
was
supposed
that
the
sun
distance
could
not
exceed
five
million
miles
and
indeed
there
were
many
who
thought
that
estimate
very
extravagant
from
a
review
of
the
observations
of
tycho
brahe
kepler
however
concluded
that
the
error
was
actually
in
the
opposite
direction
and
that
the
estimate
must
be
raised
to
at
least
thirteen
million
in
cassini
showed
that
these
numbers
were
altogether
inconsistent
with
the
facts
and
gave
as
his
conclusion
million
the
transit
of
venus
over
the
face
of
the
sun
june
had
been
foreseen
and
its
great
value
in
the
solution
of
this
fundamental
problem
in
astronomy
appreciated
with
commendable
alacrity
various
governments
contributed
their
assistance
in
making
observations
so
that
in
europe
there
were
fifty
stations
in
asia
six
in
america
seventeen
it
was
for
this
purpose
that
the
english
government
dispatched
captain
cook
on
his
celebrated
first
voyage
he
went
to
otaheite
his
voyage
was
crowned
with
success
the
sun
rose
without
a
cloud
and
the
sky
continued
equally
clear
throughout
the
day
the
transit
at
station
lasted
from
about
nine
in
the
morning
until
about
three
in
the
afternoon
and
all
the
observations
were
made
in
a
satisfactory
manner
but
on
the
discussion
of
the
observations
made
at
the
different
stations
it
was
found
that
there
was
not
the
accordance
that
could
have
been
desired
the
result
varying
from
to
one
hundred
and
nine
million
the
celebrated
mathematician
encke
therefore
reviewed
them
in
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
sun
horizontal
parallax
that
is
the
angle
under
which
the
of
the
earth
is
seen
from
the
sun
is
seconds
this
gave
as
the
distance
miles
subsequently
the
observations
were
reconsidered
by
hansen
who
gave
as
their
result
miles
still
later
leverrier
made
it
airy
and
stone
by
another
method
made
it
stone
alone
by
a
revision
of
the
old
observations
and
finally
foucault
and
fizeau
from
physical
experiments
determining
the
velocity
of
light
and
therefore
in
their
nature
altogether
differing
from
transit
observations
until
the
results
of
the
transit
of
next
year
are
ascertained
it
must
therefore
be
admitted
that
the
distance
of
the
earth
from
the
sun
is
somewhat
less
than
million
miles
this
distance
once
determined
the
dimensions
of
the
solar
system
may
be
ascertained
with
ease
and
precision
it
is
enough
to
mention
that
the
distance
of
neptune
from
the
sun
the
most
remote
of
the
planets
at
present
known
is
about
thirty
times
that
of
the
earth
by
the
aid
of
these
numbers
we
may
begin
to
gain
a
just
appreciation
of
the
doctrine
of
the
human
destiny
of
the
universe
the
doctrine
that
all
things
were
made
for
man
seen
from
the
sun
the
earth
dwindles
away
to
a
mere
speck
a
mere
glistening
in
his
beams
if
the
reader
wishes
a
more
precise
valuation
let
him
hold
a
page
of
this
book
a
couple
of
feet
from
his
eye
then
let
him
consider
one
of
its
dots
or
full
stops
that
dot
is
several
hundred
times
larger
in
surface
than
is
the
earth
as
seen
from
the
sun
of
what
consequence
then
can
such
an
almost
imperceptible
particle
be
one
might
think
that
it
could
be
removed
or
even
annihilated
and
yet
never
be
missed
of
what
consequence
is
one
of
those
human
monads
of
whom
more
than
a
thousand
millions
swarm
on
the
surface
of
this
all
but
invisible
speck
and
of
a
million
of
whom
scarcely
one
will
leave
a
trace
that
he
has
ever
existed
of
what
consequence
is
man
his
pleasures
or
his
pains
among
the
arguments
brought
forward
against
the
copernican
system
at
the
time
of
its
promulgation
was
one
by
the
great
danish
astronomer
tycho
brahe
originally
urged
by
aristarchus
against
the
pythagorean
system
to
the
effect
that
if
as
was
alleged
the
earth
moves
round
the
sun
there
ought
to
be
a
change
of
the
direction
in
which
the
fixed
stars
appear
at
one
time
we
are
nearer
to
a
particular
region
of
the
heavens
by
a
distance
equal
to
the
whole
diameter
of
the
earth
orbit
than
we
were
six
months
previously
and
hence
there
ought
to
be
a
change
in
the
relative
position
of
the
stars
they
should
seem
to
separate
as
we
approach
them
and
to
close
together
as
we
recede
from
them
or
to
use
the
astronomical
expression
these
stars
should
have
a
yearly
parallax
the
parallax
of
a
star
is
the
angle
contained
between
two
lines
drawn
from
it
one
to
the
sun
the
other
to
the
earth
at
that
time
the
earth
distance
from
the
sun
was
greatly
had
it
been
known
as
it
is
now
that
that
distance
exceeds
ninety
million
miles
or
that
the
diameter
of
the
orbit
is
more
than
one
hundred
and
eighty
million
that
argument
would
doubtless
have
had
very
great
weight
in
reply
to
tycho
it
was
said
that
since
the
parallax
of
a
body
diminishes
as
its
distance
increases
a
star
may
be
so
far
off
that
its
parallax
may
be
imperceptible
this
answer
proved
to
be
correct
the
detection
of
the
parallax
of
the
stars
depended
on
the
improvement
of
instruments
for
the
measurement
of
angles
the
parallax
of
alpha
centauri
a
fine
double
star
of
the
southern
hemisphere
at
present
considered
to
be
the
nearest
of
the
fixed
stars
was
first
determined
by
henderson
and
maclear
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
in
it
is
about
of
a
second
hence
this
star
is
almost
two
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
times
as
far
from
us
as
the
sun
seen
from
it
if
the
sun
were
even
large
enough
to
fill
the
whole
orbit
of
the
earth
or
one
hundred
and
eighty
million
miles
in
diameter
he
would
be
a
mere
point
with
its
companion
it
revolves
round
their
common
centre
of
gravity
in
years
and
hence
it
would
seem
that
their
conjoint
mass
is
less
than
that
of
the
sun
the
star
cygni
is
of
the
sixth
magnitude
its
parallax
was
first
found
by
bessel
in
and
is
about
of
a
second
the
distance
from
us
is
therefore
much
more
than
five
hundred
thousand
times
that
of
the
sun
with
its
companion
it
revolves
round
their
common
centre
of
gravity
in
five
hundred
and
twenty
years
their
conjoint
weight
is
about
that
of
the
sun
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
great
star
sirius
the
brightest
in
the
heavens
is
about
six
times
as
far
off
as
alpha
centauri
his
probable
diameter
is
twelve
million
miles
and
the
light
he
emits
two
hundred
times
more
brilliant
than
that
of
the
sun
yet
even
through
the
telescope
he
has
no
measurable
diameter
he
looks
merely
like
a
very
bright
spark
the
stars
then
differ
not
merely
in
visible
magnitude
but
also
in
actual
size
as
the
spectroscope
shows
they
differ
greatly
in
chemical
and
physical
constitution
that
instrument
is
also
revealing
to
us
the
duration
of
the
life
of
a
star
through
changes
in
the
refrangibility
of
the
emitted
light
though
as
we
have
seen
the
nearest
to
us
is
at
an
enormous
and
all
but
immeasurable
distance
this
is
but
the
first
step
there
are
others
the
rays
of
which
have
taken
thousands
perhaps
millions
of
years
to
reach
us
the
limits
of
our
own
system
are
far
beyond
the
range
of
our
greatest
telescopes
what
then
shall
we
say
of
other
systems
beyond
worlds
are
scattered
like
dust
in
the
abysses
in
space
have
these
gigantic
bodies
myriads
of
which
are
placed
at
so
vast
a
distance
that
our
unassisted
eyes
can
not
perceive
them
have
these
no
other
purpose
than
that
assigned
by
theologians
to
give
light
to
us
does
not
their
enormous
size
demonstrate
that
as
they
are
centres
of
force
so
they
must
be
centres
of
motion
suns
for
other
systems
of
worlds
while
yet
these
facts
were
very
imperfectly
known
indeed
were
rather
speculations
than
facts
giordano
bruno
an
italian
born
seven
years
after
the
death
of
copernicus
published
a
work
on
the
infinity
of
the
universe
and
of
worlds
he
was
also
the
author
of
evening
conversations
on
an
apology
for
the
copernican
system
and
of
the
one
sole
cause
of
things
to
these
may
be
added
an
allegory
published
in
the
expulsion
of
the
triumphant
beast
he
had
also
collected
for
the
use
of
future
astronomers
all
the
observations
he
could
find
respecting
the
new
star
that
suddenly
appeared
in
cassiopeia
and
increased
in
brilliancy
until
it
surpassed
all
the
other
stars
it
could
be
plainly
seen
in
the
daytime
on
a
sudden
november
it
was
as
bright
as
venus
at
her
brightest
in
the
following
march
it
was
of
the
first
magnitude
it
exhibited
various
hues
of
color
in
a
few
months
and
disappeared
in
march
the
star
that
suddenly
appeared
in
serpentarius
in
kepler
time
was
at
first
brighter
than
venus
it
lasted
more
than
a
year
and
passing
through
various
tints
of
purple
yellow
red
became
extinguished
originally
bruno
was
intended
for
the
church
he
had
become
a
dominican
but
was
led
into
doubt
by
his
meditations
on
the
subjects
of
transubstantiation
and
the
immaculate
conception
not
caring
to
conceal
his
opinions
he
soon
fell
under
the
censure
of
the
spiritual
authorities
and
found
it
necessary
to
seek
refuge
successively
in
switzerland
france
england
germany
the
of
the
inquisition
followed
his
track
remorselessly
and
eventually
hunted
him
back
to
italy
he
was
arrested
in
venice
and
confined
in
the
piombi
for
six
years
without
books
or
paper
or
friends
in
england
he
had
given
lectures
on
the
plurality
of
worlds
and
in
that
country
had
written
in
italian
his
most
important
works
it
added
not
a
little
to
the
exasperation
against
him
that
he
was
perpetually
declaiming
against
the
insincerity
the
impostures
of
his
persecutors
that
wherever
he
went
he
found
skepticism
varnished
over
and
concealed
by
hypocrisy
and
that
it
was
not
against
the
belief
of
men
but
against
their
pretended
belief
that
he
was
fighting
that
he
was
struggling
with
an
orthodoxy
that
had
neither
morality
nor
faith
in
his
evening
conversations
he
had
insisted
that
the
scriptures
were
never
intended
to
teach
science
but
morals
only
and
that
they
can
not
be
received
as
of
any
authority
on
astronomical
and
physical
subjects
especially
must
we
reject
the
view
they
reveal
to
us
of
the
constitution
of
the
world
that
the
earth
is
a
flat
surface
supported
on
pillars
that
the
sky
is
a
firmament
the
floor
of
heaven
on
the
contrary
we
must
believe
that
the
universe
is
infinite
and
that
it
is
filled
with
and
opaque
worlds
many
of
them
inhabited
that
there
is
nothing
above
and
around
us
but
space
and
stars
his
meditations
on
these
subjects
had
brought
him
to
the
conclusion
that
the
views
of
averroes
are
not
far
from
the
truth
that
there
is
an
intellect
which
animates
the
universe
and
of
this
intellect
the
visible
world
is
only
an
emanation
or
manifestation
originated
and
sustained
by
force
derived
from
it
and
were
that
force
withdrawn
all
things
would
disappear
this
intellect
is
god
who
lives
in
all
things
even
such
as
seem
not
to
live
that
every
thing
is
ready
to
become
organized
to
burst
into
life
god
is
therefore
the
one
sole
cause
of
things
the
all
in
all
bruno
may
hence
be
considered
among
philosophical
writers
as
intermediate
between
averroes
and
spinoza
the
latter
held
that
god
and
the
universe
are
the
same
that
all
events
happen
by
an
immutable
law
of
nature
by
an
unconquerable
necessity
that
god
is
the
universe
producing
a
series
of
necessary
movements
or
acts
in
consequence
of
intrinsic
unchangeable
and
irresistible
energy
on
the
demand
of
the
spiritual
authorities
bruno
was
removed
from
venice
to
rome
and
confined
in
the
prison
of
the
inquisition
accused
not
only
of
being
a
heretic
but
also
a
heresiarch
who
had
written
things
unseemly
concerning
religion
the
special
charge
against
him
being
that
he
had
taught
the
plurality
of
worlds
a
doctrine
repugnant
to
the
whole
tenor
of
scripture
and
inimical
to
revealed
religion
especially
as
regards
the
plan
of
salvation
after
an
imprisonment
of
two
years
he
was
brought
before
his
judges
declared
guilty
of
the
acts
alleged
excommunicated
and
on
his
nobly
refusing
to
recant
was
delivered
over
to
the
secular
authorities
to
be
punished
as
mercifully
as
possible
and
without
the
shedding
of
his
blood
the
horrible
formula
for
burning
a
prisoner
at
the
stake
knowing
well
that
though
his
tormentors
might
destroy
his
body
his
thoughts
would
still
live
among
men
he
said
to
his
judges
perhaps
it
is
with
greater
fear
that
you
pass
the
sentence
upon
me
than
i
receive
it
the
sentence
was
carried
into
effect
and
he
was
burnt
at
rome
february
no
one
can
recall
without
sentiments
of
pity
the
sufferings
of
those
countless
martyrs
who
first
by
one
party
and
then
by
another
have
been
brought
for
their
religious
opinions
to
the
stake
but
each
of
these
had
in
his
supreme
moment
a
powerful
and
unfailing
support
the
passage
from
this
life
to
the
next
though
through
a
hard
trial
was
the
passage
from
a
transient
trouble
to
eternal
happiness
an
escape
from
the
cruelty
of
earth
to
the
charity
of
heaven
on
his
way
through
the
dark
valley
the
martyr
believed
that
there
was
an
invisible
hand
that
would
lead
him
a
friend
that
would
guide
him
all
the
more
gently
and
firmly
because
of
the
terrors
of
the
flames
for
bruno
there
was
no
such
support
the
philosophical
opinions
for
the
sake
of
which
he
surrendered
his
life
could
give
him
no
consolation
he
must
fight
the
last
fight
alone
is
there
not
something
very
grand
in
the
attitude
of
this
solitary
man
something
which
human
nature
can
not
help
admiring
as
he
stands
in
the
gloomy
hall
before
his
inexorable
judges
no
accuser
no
witness
no
advocate
is
present
but
the
familiars
of
the
holy
office
clad
in
black
are
stealthily
moving
about
the
tormentors
and
the
rack
are
in
the
vaults
below
he
is
simply
told
that
he
has
brought
upon
himself
strong
suspicions
of
heresy
since
he
has
said
that
there
are
other
worlds
than
ours
he
is
asked
if
he
will
recant
and
abjure
his
error
he
can
not
and
will
not
deny
what
he
knows
to
be
true
and
perhaps
for
he
had
often
done
so
before
he
tells
his
judges
that
they
too
in
their
hearts
are
of
the
same
belief
what
a
contrast
between
this
scene
of
manly
honor
of
unshaken
firmness
of
inflexible
adherence
to
the
truth
and
that
other
scene
which
took
place
more
than
fifteen
centuries
previously
by
the
fireside
in
the
hall
of
caiaphas
the
when
the
cock
crew
and
the
lord
turned
and
looked
upon
peter
luke
xxii
and
yet
it
is
upon
peter
that
the
church
has
grounded
her
right
to
act
as
she
did
to
bruno
but
perhaps
the
day
approaches
when
posterity
will
offer
an
expiation
for
this
great
ecclesiastical
crime
and
a
statue
of
bruno
be
unveiled
under
the
dome
of
peter
at
rome
chapter
vii
controversy
respecting
the
age
of
the
earth
scriptural
view
that
the
earth
is
only
six
thousand
years
old
and
that
it
was
made
in
a
patristic
chronology
founded
on
the
ages
of
the
difficulties
arising
from
different
estimates
in
different
versions
of
the
bible
legend
of
the
the
the
tower
of

the
confusion
of
the
primitive

discovery
by
cassini
of
the

of

discovery
by
newton
of
the
oblateness
of
the
deduction
that
she
has
been
modeled
by
mechanical
confirmation
of
this
by
geological
discoveries
respecting
aqueous
rocks
corroboration
by
organic
the
necessity
of
admitting
enormously
long
periods
of
displacement
of
the
doctrine
of
creation
by
that
of
evolution
discoveries
respecting
the
antiquity
of
man
the
and
of
the
world
are
moderation
with
which
the
discussion
of
the
age
of
the
world
has
been
conducted
the
true
position
of
the
earth
in
the
universe
was
established
only
after
a
long
and
severe
conflict
the
church
used
whatever
power
she
had
even
to
the
infliction
of
death
for
sustaining
her
ideas
but
it
was
in
vain
the
evidence
in
behalf
of
the
copernican
theory
became
irresistible
it
was
at
length
universally
admitted
that
the
sun
is
the
central
the
ruling
body
of
our
system
the
earth
only
one
and
by
no
means
the
largest
of
a
family
of
encircling
planets
taught
by
the
issue
of
that
dispute
when
the
question
of
the
age
of
the
world
presented
itself
for
consideration
the
church
did
not
exhibit
the
active
resistance
she
had
displayed
on
the
former
occasion
for
though
her
traditions
were
again
put
in
jeopardy
they
were
not
in
her
judgment
so
vitally
assailed
to
dethrone
the
earth
from
her
dominating
position
was
so
the
spiritual
authorities
declared
to
undermine
the
very
foundation
of
revealed
truth
but
discussions
respecting
the
date
of
creation
might
within
certain
limits
be
permitted
those
limits
were
however
very
quickly
overpassed
and
thus
the
controversy
became
as
dangerous
as
the
former
one
had
been
it
was
not
possible
to
adopt
the
advice
given
by
plato
in
his
timaeus
when
treating
of
this
subject
the
origin
of
the
universe
it
is
proper
that
both
i
who
speak
and
you
who
judge
should
remember
that
we
are
but
men
and
therefore
receiving
the
probable
mythological
tradition
it
is
meet
that
we
inquire
no
further
into
it
since
the
time
of
augustine
the
scriptures
had
been
made
the
great
and
final
authority
in
all
matters
of
science
and
theologians
had
deduced
from
them
schemes
of
chronology
and
cosmogony
which
had
proved
to
be
to
the
advance
of
real
knowledge
it
is
not
necessary
for
us
to
do
more
than
to
allude
to
some
of
the
leading
features
of
these
schemes
their
peculiarities
will
be
easily
discerned
with
sufficient
clearness
thus
from
the
six
days
of
creation
and
the
of
rest
since
we
are
told
that
a
day
is
with
the
lord
as
a
thousand
years
it
was
inferred
that
the
duration
of
the
world
will
be
through
six
thousand
years
of
suffering
and
an
additional
thousand
a
millennium
of
rest
it
was
generally
admitted
that
the
earth
was
about
four
thousand
years
old
at
the
birth
of
christ
but
so
careless
had
europe
been
in
the
study
of
its
annals
that
not
until
had
it
a
proper
chronology
of
its
own
a
roman
abbot
dionysius
exiguus
or
dennis
the
less
then
fixed
the
vulgar
era
and
gave
europe
its
present
christian
chronology
the
method
followed
in
obtaining
the
earliest
chronological
dates
was
by
computations
mainly
founded
on
the
lives
of
the
patriarchs
much
difficulty
was
encountered
in
reconciling
numerical
discrepancies
even
if
as
was
taken
for
granted
in
those
uncritical
ages
moses
was
the
author
of
the
books
imputed
to
him
due
weight
was
not
given
to
the
fact
that
he
related
events
many
of
which
took
place
more
than
two
thousand
years
before
he
was
born
it
scarcely
seemed
necessary
to
regard
the
pentateuch
as
of
plenary
inspiration
since
no
means
had
been
provided
to
perpetuate
its
correctness
the
different
copies
which
had
escaped
the
chances
of
time
varied
very
much
thus
the
samaritan
made
thirteen
hundred
and
seven
years
from
the
creation
to
the
deluge
the
hebrew
sixteen
hundred
and
the
septuagint
hundred
and
the
septuagint
counted
fifteen
hundred
years
more
from
the
creation
to
abraham
than
the
hebrew
in
general
however
there
was
an
inclination
to
the
supposition
that
the
deluge
took
place
about
two
thousand
years
after
the
creation
and
after
another
interval
of
two
thousand
years
christ
was
born
persons
who
had
given
much
attention
to
the
subject
affirmed
that
there
were
not
less
than
one
hundred
and
different
opinions
as
to
the
year
in
which
the
messiah
appeared
and
hence
they
declared
that
it
was
inexpedient
to
press
for
acceptance
the
scriptural
numbers
too
closely
since
it
was
plain
from
the
great
differences
in
different
copies
that
there
had
been
no
providential
intervention
to
perpetuate
a
correct
reading
nor
was
there
any
mark
by
which
men
could
be
guided
to
the
only
authentic
version
even
those
held
in
the
highest
esteem
contained
undeniable
errors
thus
the
septuagint
made
methuselah
live
until
after
the
deluge
it
was
thought
that
in
the
antediluvian
world
the
year
consisted
of
three
hundred
and
sixty
days
some
even
affirmed
that
this
was
the
origin
of
the
division
of
the
circle
into
three
hundred
and
sixty
degrees
at
the
time
of
the
deluge
so
many
theologians
declared
the
motion
of
the
sun
was
altered
and
the
year
became
five
days
and
six
hours
longer
there
was
a
prevalent
opinion
that
that
stupendous
event
occurred
on
november
in
the
year
of
the
world
whiston
however
disposed
to
greater
precision
inclined
to
postpone
it
to
november
some
thought
that
the
rainbow
was
not
seen
until
after
the
flood
others
apparently
with
better
reason
inferred
that
it
was
then
first
established
as
a
sign
on
coming
forth
from
the
ark
men
received
permission
to
use
flesh
as
food
the
antediluvians
having
been
herbivorous
it
would
seem
that
the
deluge
had
not
occasioned
any
great
geographical
changes
for
noah
relying
on
his
antediluvian
knowledge
proceeded
to
divide
the

among
his
three
sons

no
provision
was
made
for
america
as
he
did
not
know
of
its
existence
these
patriarchs
undeterred
by
the
terrible
solitudes
to
which
they
were
going
by
the
undrained
swamps
and
untracked
forests
journeyed
to
their
allotted
possessions
and
commenced
the
settlement
of
the
continents
in
seventy
years
the
asiatic
family
had
increased
to
several
hundred
they
had
found
their
way
to
the
plains
of
mesopotamia
and
there
for
some
motive
that
we
can
not
divine
began
building
a
tower
whose
top
might
reach
to
heaven
eusebius
informs
us
that
the
work
continued
for
forty
years
they
did
not
abandon
it
until
a
miraculous
confusion
of
their
language
took
place
and
dispersed
them
all
over
the
earth
ambrose
shows
that
this
confusion
could
not
have
been
brought
about
by
men
origen
believes
that
not
even
the
angels
accomplished
it
the
confusion
of
tongues
has
given
rise
to
many
curious
speculations
among
divines
as
to
the
primitive
speech
of
man
some
have
thought
that
the
language
of
adam
consisted
altogether
of
nouns
that
they
were
monosyllables
and
that
the
confusion
was
occasioned
by
the
introduction
of
polysyllables
but
these
learned
men
must
surely
have
overlooked
the
numerous
conversations
reported
in
genesis
such
as
those
between
the
almighty
and
adam
the
serpent
and
eve
etc
in
these
all
the
various
parts
of
speech
occur
there
was
however
a
coincidence
of
opinion
that
the
primitive
language
was
hebrew
on
the
general
principles
of
patristicism
it
was
fitting
that
this
should
be
the
case
the
greek
fathers
computed
that
at
the
time
of
the
dispersion
nations
were
formed
and
in
this
conclusion
augustine
coincides
but
difficulties
seem
to
have
been
recognized
in
these
computations
thus
the
learned
shuckford
who
has
treated
very
elaborately
on
all
the
foregoing
points
in
his
excellent
work
on
the
sacred
and
profane
history
of
the
world
connected
demonstrates
that
there
could
not
have
been
more
than
or
men
women
and
children
in
each
of
those
kingdoms
a
very
vital
point
in
this
system
of
chronological
computation
based
upon
the
ages
of
the
patriarchs
was
the
great
length
of
life
to
which
those
worthies
attained
it
was
generally
supposed
that
before
the
flood
there
was
a
perpetual
equinox
and
no
vicissitudes
in
nature
after
that
event
the
standard
of
life
diminished
and
in
the
time
of
the
psalmist
it
had
sunk
to
seventy
years
at
which
it
still
remains
austerities
of
climate
were
affirmed
to
have
arisen
through
the
shifting
of
the
earth
axis
at
the
flood
and
to
this
ill
effect
were
added
the
noxious
influences
of
that
universal
catastrophe
which
converting
the
surface
of
the
earth
into
a
vast
swamp
gave
rise
to
fermentations
of
the
blood
and
a
weakening
of
the
fibres
with
a
view
of
avoiding
difficulties
arising
from
the
extraordinary
length
of
the
patriarchal
lives
certain
divines
suggested
that
the
years
spoken
of
by
the
sacred
penman
were
not
ordinary
but
lunar
years
this
though
it
might
bring
the
age
of
those
venerable
men
within
the
recent
term
of
life
introduced
however
another
insuperable
difficulty
since
it
made
them
have
children
when
only
five
or
six
years
old
sacred
science
as
interpreted
by
the
fathers
of
the
church
demonstrated
these
facts
that
the
date
of
creation
was
comparatively
recent
not
more
than
four
or
five
thousand
years
before
christ
that
the
act
of
creation
occupied
the
space
of
six
ordinary
days
that
the
deluge
was
universal
and
that
the
animals
which
survived
it
were
preserved
in
an
ark
that
adam
was
created
perfect
in
morality
and
intelligence
that
he
fell
and
that
his
descendants
have
shared
in
his
sin
and
his
fall
of
these
points
and
others
that
might
be
mentioned
there
were
two
on
which
ecclesiastical
authority
felt
that
it
must
insist
these
were
the
recent
date
of
creation
for
the
remoter
that
event
the
more
urgent
the
necessity
of
vindicating
the
justice
of
god
who
apparently
had
left
the
majority
of
our
race
to
its
fate
and
had
reserved
salvation
for
the
few
who
were
living
in
the
closing
ages
of
the
world
the
perfect
condition
of
adam
at
his
creation
since
this
was
necessary
to
the
theory
of
the
fall
and
the
plan
of
salvation
theological
authorities
were
therefore
constrained
to
look
with
disfavor
on
any
attempt
to
carry
back
the
origin
of
the
earth
to
an
epoch
indefinitely
remote
and
on
the
mohammedan
theory
of
the
evolution
of
man
from
lower
forms
or
his
gradual
development
to
his
present
condition
in
the
long
lapse
of
time
from
the
puerilities
absurdities
and
contradictions
of
the
foregoing
statement
we
may
gather
how
very
unsatisfactory
this
sacred
science
was
and
perhaps
we
may
be
brought
to
the
conclusion
to
which
shuckford
above
quoted
was
constrained
to
come
after
his
wearisome
and
unavailing
attempt
to
coordinate
its
various
parts
as
to
the
fathers
of
the
first
ages
of
the
church
they
were
good
men
but
not
men
of
universal
learning
sacred
cosmogony
regards
the
formation
and
modeling
of
the
earth
as
the
direct
act
of
god
it
rejects
the
intervention
of
secondary
causes
in
those
events
scientific
cosmogony
dates
from
the
telescopic
discovery
made
by
cassini
an
italian
astronomer
under
whose
care
louis
xiv
placed
the
observatory
of
paris
that
the
planet
jupiter
is
not
a
sphere
but
an
oblate
spheroid
flattened
at
the
poles
mechanical
philosophy
demonstrated
that
such
a
figure
is
the
necessary
result
of
the
rotation
of
a
yielding
mass
and
that
the
more
rapid
the
rotation
the
greater
the
flattening
or
what
comes
to
the
same
thing
the
greater
the
equatorial
bulging
must
be
from
considerations
purely
of
a
mechanical
kind
newton
had
foreseen
that
such
likewise
though
to
a
less
striking
extent
must
be
the
figure
of
the
earth
to
the
protuberant
mass
is
due
the
precession
of
the
equinoxes
which
requires
thousand
eight
hundred
and
years
for
its
completion
and
also
the
nutation
of
the
earth
axis
discovered
by
bradley
we
have
already
had
occasion
to
remark
that
the
earth
equatorial
diameter
exceeds
the
polar
by
about
miles
two
facts
are
revealed
by
the
oblateness
of
the
earth
that
she
has
formerly
been
in
a
yielding
or
plastic
condition
that
she
has
been
modeled
by
a
mechanical
and
therefore
a
secondary
cause
but
this
influence
of
mechanical
causes
is
manifested
not
only
in
the
exterior
configuration
of
the
globe
of
the
earth
as
a
spheroid
of
revolution
it
also
plainly
appears
on
an
examination
of
the
arrangement
of
her
substance
if
we
consider
the
aqueous
rocks
their
aggregate
is
many
miles
in
thickness
yet
they
undeniably
have
been
of
slow
deposit
the
material
of
which
they
consist
has
been
obtained
by
the
disintegration
of
ancient
lands
it
has
found
its
way
into
the
and
by
them
been
distributed
anew
effects
of
this
kind
taking
place
before
our
eyes
require
a
very
considerable
lapse
of
time
to
produce
a
result
a
water
deposit
may
in
this
manner
measure
in
thickness
a
few
inches
in
a
century
what
then
shall
we
say
as
to
the
time
consumed
in
the
formation
of
deposits
of
many
thousand
yards
the
position
of
the
of
egypt
has
been
known
for
much
more
than
two
thousand
years
in
that
time
it
has
made
by
reason
of
the
detritus
brought
down
by
the
nile
a
encroachment
on
the
mediterranean
but
all
lower
egypt
has
had
a
similar
origin
the
near
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
has
been
well
known
for
three
hundred
years
and
during
that
time
has
scarcely
made
a
perceptible
advance
on
the
gulf
of
mexico
but
there
was
a
time
when
the
delta
of
that
river
was
at
louis
more
than
seven
hundred
miles
from
its
present
position
in
egypt
and
in
america
in
fact
in
all
countries
the
rivers
have
been
inch
by
inch
prolonging
the
land
into
the
sea
the
slowness
of
their
work
and
the
vastness
of
its
extent
satisfy
us
that
we
must
concede
for
the
operation
enormous
periods
of
time
to
the
same
conclusion
we
are
brought
if
we
consider
the
filling
of
lakes
the
deposit
of
travertines
the
denudation
of
hills
the
cutting
action
of
the
sea
on
its
shores
the
undermining
of
cliffs
the
weathering
of
rocks
by
atmospheric
water
and
carbonic
acid
sedimentary
strata
must
have
been
originally
deposited
in
planes
nearly
horizontal
vast
numbers
of
them
have
been
forced
either
by
paroxysms
at
intervals
or
by
gradual
movement
into
all
manner
of
angular
inclinations
whatever
explanations
we
may
offer
of
these
innumerable
and
immense
tilts
and
fractures
they
would
seem
to
demand
for
their
completion
an
inconceivable
length
of
time
the
strata
in
wales
by
their
gradual
submergence
have
attained
a
thickness
of
feet
in
nova
scotia
of
feet
so
slow
and
so
steady
was
this
submergence
that
erect
trees
stand
one
above
another
on
successive
levels
seventeen
such
repetitions
may
be
counted
in
a
thickness
of
feet
the
age
of
the
trees
is
proved
by
their
size
some
being
four
feet
in
diameter
round
them
as
they
gradually
went
down
with
the
subsiding
soil
calamites
grew
at
one
level
after
another
in
the
sydney
fossil
forests
occur
in
superposition
marine
shells
found
on
far
in
the
interior
of
continents
were
regarded
by
theological
writers
as
an
indisputable
illustration
of
the
deluge
but
when
as
geological
studies
became
more
exact
it
was
proved
that
in
the
crust
of
the
earth
vast
formations
are
repeatedly
intercalated
with
vast
marine
ones
like
the
leaves
of
a
book
it
became
evident
that
no
single
cataclysm
was
sufficient
to
account
for
such
results
that
the
same
region
through
gradual
variations
of
its
level
and
changes
in
its
topographical
surroundings
had
sometimes
been
dry
land
sometimes
covered
with
fresh
and
sometimes
with
sea
water
it
became
evident
also
that
for
the
completion
of
these
changes
tens
of
thousands
of
years
were
required
to
this
evidence
of
a
remote
origin
of
the
earth
derived
from
the
vast
superficial
extent
the
enormous
thickness
and
the
varied
characters
of
its
strata
was
added
an
imposing
body
of
proof
depending
on
its
fossil
remains
the
relative
ages
of
formations
having
been
ascertained
it
was
shown
that
there
has
been
an
advancing
physiological
progression
of
organic
forms
both
vegetable
and
animal
from
the
oldest
to
the
most
recent
that
those
which
inhabit
the
surface
in
our
times
are
but
an
insignificant
fraction
of
the
prodigious
multitude
that
have
inhabited
it
heretofore
that
for
each
species
now
living
there
are
thousands
that
have
become
extinct
though
special
formations
are
so
strikingly
characterized
by
some
predominating
type
of
life
as
to
justify
such
expressions
as
the
age
of
mollusks
the
age
of
reptiles
the
age
of
mammals
the
introduction
of
the
did
not
take
place
abruptly
as
by
sudden
creation
they
gradually
emerged
in
an
antecedent
age
reached
their
culmination
in
the
one
which
they
characterize
and
then
gradually
died
out
in
a
succeeding
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
sudden
creation
a
sudden
strange
appearance
but
there
is
a
slow
metamorphosis
a
slow
development
from
a
preexisting
form
here
again
we
encounter
the
necessity
of
admitting
for
such
results
long
periods
of
time
within
the
range
of
history
no
instance
of
such
development
has
been
witnessed
and
we
speak
with
hesitation
of
doubtful
instances
of
extinction
yet
in
geological
times
myriads
of
evolutions
and
extinctions
have
occurred
since
thus
within
the
experience
of
man
no
case
of
metamorphosis
or
development
has
been
observed
some
have
been
disposed
to
deny
its
possibility
altogether
affirming
that
all
the
different
species
have
come
into
existence
by
separate
creative
acts
but
surely
it
is
less
unphilosophical
to
suppose
that
each
species
has
been
evolved
from
a
predecessor
by
a
modification
of
its
parts
than
that
it
has
suddenly
started
into
existence
out
of
nothing
nor
is
there
much
weight
in
the
remark
that
no
man
has
ever
witnessed
such
a
transformation
taking
place
let
it
be
remembered
that
no
man
has
ever
witnessed
an
act
of
creation
the
sudden
appearance
of
an
organic
form
without
any
progenitor
abrupt
arbitrary
disconnected
creative
acts
may
serve
to
illustrate
the
divine
power
but
that
continuous
unbroken
chain
of
organisms
which
extends
from
palaeozoic
formations
to
the
formations
of
recent
times
a
chain
in
which
each
link
hangs
on
a
preceding
and
sustains
a
succeeding
one
demonstrates
to
us
not
only
that
the
production
of
animated
beings
is
governed
by
law
but
that
it
is
by
law
that
has
undergone
no
change
in
its
operation
through
myriads
of
ages
there
has
been
no
variation
no
suspension
the
foregoing
paragraphs
may
serve
to
indicate
the
character
of
a
portion
of
the
evidence
with
which
we
must
deal
in
considering
the
problem
of
the
age
of
the
earth
through
the
unintermitting
labors
of
geologists
so
immense
a
mass
has
been
accumulated
that
many
volumes
would
be
required
to
contain
the
details
it
is
drawn
from
the
phenomena
presented
by
all
kinds
of
rocks
aqueous
igneous
metamorphic
of
aqueous
rocks
it
investigates
the
thickness
the
inclined
positions
and
how
they
rest
unconformably
on
one
another
how
those
that
are
of
origin
are
intercalated
with
those
that
are
marine
how
vast
masses
of
material
have
been
removed
by
causes
of
denudation
and
extensive
geographical
surfaces
have
been
remodeled
how
continents
have
undergone
movements
of
elevation
and
depression
their
shores
sunk
under
the
ocean
or
and
carried
far
into
the
interior
it
considers
the
zoological
and
botanical
facts
the
fauna
and
flora
of
the
successive
ages
and
how
in
an
orderly
manner
the
chain
of
organic
forms
plants
and
animals
has
been
extended
from
its
dim
and
doubtful
beginnings
to
our
own
times
from
facts
presented
by
the
deposits
of
which
in
all
its
varieties
has
originated
from
the
decay
of
plants
it
not
only
demon
strates
the
changes
that
have
taken
place
in
the
earth
atmosphere
but
also
universal
changes
of
climate
from
other
facts
it
proves
that
there
have
been
oscillations
of
temperature
periods
in
which
the
mean
heat
has
risen
and
periods
in
which
the
polar
ices
and
snows
have
covered
large
portions
of
the
existing
continents
glacial
periods
as
they
are
termed
one
school
of
geologists
resting
its
argument
on
very
imposing
evidence
teaches
that
the
whole
mass
of
the
earth
from
being
in
a
molten
or
perhaps
a
vaporous
condition
has
cooled
by
radiation
in
the
lapse
of
millions
of
ages
until
it
has
reached
its
present
equilibrium
of
temperature
astronomical
observations
give
great
weight
to
this
interpretation
especially
so
far
as
the
planetary
bodies
of
the
solar
system
are
concerned
it
is
also
supported
by
such
facts
as
the
small
mean
density
of
the
earth
the
increasing
temperature
at
increasing
depths
the
phenomena
of
volcanoes
and
injected
veins
and
those
of
igneous
and
metamorphic
rocks
to
satisfy
the
physical
changes
which
this
school
of
geologists
contemplates
myriads
of
centuries
are
required
but
with
the
views
that
the
adoption
of
the
copernican
system
has
given
us
it
is
plain
that
we
can
not
consider
the
origin
and
biography
of
the
earth
in
an
isolated
way
we
must
include
with
her
all
the
other
members
of
the
system
or
family
to
which
she
belongs
nay
more
we
can
not
restrict
ourselves
to
the
solar
system
we
must
embrace
in
our
discussions
the
starry
worlds
and
since
we
have
become
familiarized
with
their
almost
immeasurable
distances
from
one
another
we
are
prepared
to
accept
for
their
origin
an
immeasurably
remote
time
there
are
stars
so
far
off
that
their
light
fast
as
it
travels
has
taken
thousands
of
years
to
reach
us
and
hence
they
must
have
been
in
existence
many
thousands
of
years
ago
geologists
having
unanimously
agreed
for
perhaps
there
is
not
a
single
dissenting
voice
that
the
chronology
of
the
earth
must
be
greatly
extended
attempts
have
been
made
to
give
precision
to
it
some
of
these
have
been
based
on
astronomical
some
on
physical
principles
thus
calculations
founded
on
the
known
changes
of
the
eccentricity
of
the
earth
orbit
with
a
view
of
determining
the
lapse
of
time
since
the
beginning
of
the
last
glacial
period
have
given
two
hundred
and
forty
thousand
years
though
the
general
postulate
of
the
immensity
of
geological
times
may
be
conceded
such
calculations
are
on
too
uncertain
a
theoretical
basis
to
furnish
incontestable
results
but
considering
the
whole
subject
from
the
present
scientific
it
is
very
clear
that
the
views
presented
by
theological
writers
as
derived
from
the
mosaic
record
can
not
be
admitted
attempts
have
been
repeatedly
made
to
reconcile
the
revealed
with
the
discovered
facts
but
they
have
proved
to
be
unsatisfactory
the
mosaic
time
is
too
short
the
order
of
creation
incorrect
the
divine
interventions
too
anthropomorphic
and
though
the
presentment
of
the
subject
is
in
harmony
with
the
ideas
that
men
have
entertained
when
first
their
minds
were
turned
to
the
acquisition
of
natural
knowledge
it
is
not
in
accordance
with
their
present
conceptions
of
the
insignificance
of
the
earth
and
the
grandeur
of
the
universe
among
late
geological
discoveries
is
one
of
special
interest
it
is
the
detection
of
human
remains
and
human
works
in
formations
which
though
geologically
recent
are
historically
very
remote
the
fossil
remains
of
men
with
rude
implements
of
rough
or
chipped
flint
of
polished
stone
of
bone
of
bronze
are
found
in
europe
in
caves
in
drifts
in
they
indicate
a
savage
life
spent
in
hunting
and
fishing
recent
researches
give
reason
to
believe
that
under
low
and
base
grades
the
existence
of
man
can
be
traced
back
into
the
tertiary
times
he
was
contemporary
with
the
southern
elephant
the
rhinoceros
leptorhinus
the
great
hippopotamus
perhaps
even
in
the
miocene
contemporary
with
the
mastodon
at
the
close
of
the
tertiary
period
from
causes
not
yet
determined
the
northern
hemisphere
underwent
a
great
depression
of
temperature
from
a
torrid
it
passed
to
a
glacial
condition
after
a
period
of
prodigious
length
the
temperature
again
rose
and
the
glaciers
that
had
so
extensively
covered
the
surface
receded
once
more
there
was
a
decline
in
the
heat
and
the
glaciers
again
advanced
but
this
time
not
so
far
as
formerly
this
ushered
in
the
quaternary
period
during
which
very
slowly
the
temperature
came
to
its
present
degree
the
water
deposits
that
were
being
made
required
thousands
of
centuries
for
their
completion
at
the
beginning
of
the
quaternary
period
there
were
alive
the
the
the
amphibious
hippopotamus
the
rhinoceros
with
chambered
nostrils
the
mammoth
in
fact
the
mammoth
swarmed
he
delighted
in
a
boreal
climate
by
degrees
the
reindeer
the
horse
the
ox
the
bison
multiplied
and
disputed
with
him
his
food
partly
for
this
reason
and
partly
because
of
the
increasing
heat
he
became
extinct
from
middle
europe
also
the
reindeer
retired
his
departure
marks
the
end
of
the
quaternary
period
since
the
advent
of
man
on
the
earth
we
have
therefore
to
deal
with
periods
of
incalculable
length
vast
changes
in
the
climate
and
fauna
were
produced
by
the
slow
operation
of
causes
such
as
are
in
action
at
the
present
day
figures
can
not
enable
us
to
appreciate
these
enormous
lapses
of
time
it
seems
to
be
satisfactorily
established
that
a
race
allied
to
the
basques
may
be
traced
back
to
the
neolithic
age
at
that
time
the
british
islands
were
undergoing
a
change
of
level
like
that
at
present
occurring
in
the
scandinavian
peninsula
scotland
was
rising
england
was
sinking
in
the
pleistocene
age
there
existed
in
central
europe
a
rude
race
of
hunters
and
fishers
closely
allied
to
the
esquimaux
in
the
old
glacial
drift
of
scotland
the
relics
of
man
are
found
along
with
those
of
the
fossil
elephant
this
carries
us
back
to
that
time
above
referred
to
when
a
large
portion
of
europe
was
covered
with
ice
which
had
edged
down
from
the
polar
regions
to
southerly
latitudes
and
as
glaciers
descended
from
the
summits
of
the
into
the
plains
countless
species
of
animals
perished
in
this
cataclysm
of
ice
and
snow
but
man
survived
in
his
primitive
savage
condition
living
for
the
most
part
on
fruits
roots
man
was
in
possession
of
a
fact
which
was
certain
eventually
to
insure
his
civilization
he
knew
how
to
make
a
fire
in
under
the
remains
of
trees
that
in
those
localities
have
long
ago
become
extinct
his
relics
are
still
found
the
implements
that
accompany
him
indicating
a
distinct
chronological
order
near
the
surface
are
those
of
bronze
lower
down
those
of
bone
or
horn
still
lower
those
of
polished
stone
and
beneath
all
those
of
chipped
or
rough
stone
the
date
of
the
origin
of
some
of
these
beds
can
not
be
estimated
at
less
than
forty
or
fifty
thousand
years
the
caves
that
have
been
examined
in
france
and
elsewhere
have
furnished
for
the
stone
age
axes
knives
lance
and
arrow
points
scrapers
hammers
the
change
from
what
may
be
termed
the
chipped
to
the
polished
stone
period
is
very
gradual
it
coincides
with
the
domestication
of
the
dog
an
epoch
in
it
embraces
thousands
of
centuries
the
appearance
of
indicates
the
invention
of
the
bow
and
the
rise
of
man
from
a
defensive
to
an
offensive
mode
of
life
the
introduction
of
barbed
arrows
shows
how
inventive
talent
was
displaying
itself
bone
and
horn
tips
that
the
huntsman
was
including
smaller
animals
and
perhaps
birds
in
his
chase
bone
whistles
his
companionship
with
other
huntsmen
or
with
his
dog
the
of
flint
indicate
the
use
of
skin
for
clothing
and
rude
bodkins
and
needles
its
manufacture
shells
perforated
for
bracelets
and
necklaces
prove
how
soon
a
taste
for
personal
adornment
was
acquired
the
implements
necessary
for
the
preparation
of
pigments
suggest
the
painting
of
the
body
and
perhaps
tattooing
and
batons
of
rank
bear
witness
to
the
beginning
of
a
social
organization
with
the
utmost
interest
we
look
upon
the
first
germs
of
art
among
these
primitive
men
they
have
left
its
rude
sketches
on
pieces
of
ivory
and
flakes
of
bone
and
carvings
of
the
animals
contemporary
with
them
in
these
prehistoric
delineations
sometimes
not
without
spirit
we
have
mammoths
combats
of
reindeer
one
presents
us
with
a
man
harpooning
a
fish
another
a
of
naked
men
armed
with
the
dart
man
is
the
only
animal
who
has
the
propensity
of
depicting
external
forms
and
of
availing
himself
of
the
use
of
fire
consisting
of
bones
and
shells
some
of
which
may
be
justly
described
as
of
vast
extent
and
of
a
date
anterior
to
the
bronze
age
and
full
of
stone
implements
bear
in
all
their
parts
indications
of
the
use
of
fire
these
are
often
adjacent
to
the
existing
coasts
sometimes
however
they
are
far
inland
in
certain
instances
as
far
as
fifty
miles
their
contents
and
position
indicate
for
them
a
date
posterior
to
that
of
the
great
extinct
mammals
but
prior
to
the
domesticated
some
of
these
it
is
said
can
not
be
less
than
one
hundred
thousand
years
old
the
in
switzerland
huts
built
on
piles
or
logs
wattled
with
boughs
were
as
may
be
inferred
from
the
accompanying
implements
begun
in
the
stone
age
and
continued
into
that
of
bronze
in
the
latter
period
the
evidences
become
numerous
of
the
adoption
of
an
agricultural
life
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
the
periods
into
which
geologists
have
found
it
convenient
to
divide
the
progress
of
man
in
civilization
are
abrupt
epochs
which
hold
good
simultaneously
for
the
whole
human
race
thus
the
wandering
indians
of
america
are
only
at
the
present
moment
emerging
from
the
stone
age
they
are
still
to
be
seen
in
many
places
armed
with
arrows
tipped
with
flakes
of
flint
it
is
but
as
yesterday
that
some
have
obtained
from
the
white
man
iron
and
the
horse
so
far
as
investigations
have
gone
they
indisputably
refer
the
existence
of
man
to
a
date
remote
from
us
by
many
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
these
investigations
are
quite
recent
and
confined
to
a
very
limited
geographical
space
no
researches
have
yet
been
made
in
those
regions
which
might
reasonably
be
regarded
as
the
primitive
habitat
of
man
we
are
thus
carried
back
immeasurably
beyond
the
six
thousand
years
of
patristic
chronology
it
is
difficult
to
assign
a
shorter
date
for
the
last
glaciation
of
europe
than
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
years
and
human
existence
antedates
that
but
not
only
is
it
this
grand
fact
that
confronts
us
we
have
to
admit
also
a
primitive
animalized
state
and
a
slow
a
gradual
development
but
this
forlorn
this
savage
condition
of
humanity
is
in
strong
contrast
to
the
paradisiacal
happiness
of
the
garden
of
eden
and
what
is
far
more
serious
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
theory
of
the
fall
i
have
been
induced
to
place
the
subject
of
this
chapter
out
of
its
proper
chronological
order
for
the
sake
of
presenting
what
i
had
to
say
respecting
the
nature
of
the
world
more
completely
by
itself
the
discussions
that
arose
as
to
the
age
of
the
earth
were
long
after
the
conflict
as
to
the
criterion
of
truth
that
is
after
the
reformation
indeed
they
were
substantially
included
in
the
present
century
they
have
been
conducted
with
so
much
moderation
as
to
justify
the
term
i
have
used
in
the
title
of
this
chapter
controversy
rather
than
conflict
geology
has
not
had
to
encounter
the
vindictive
opposition
with
which
astronomy
was
assailed
and
though
on
her
part
she
has
insisted
on
a
concession
of
great
antiquity
for
the
earth
she
has
herself
pointed
out
the
unreliability
of
all
numerical
estimates
thus
far
offered
the
attentive
reader
of
this
chapter
can
not
have
failed
to
observe
inconsistencies
in
the
numbers
quoted
though
wanting
the
merit
of
exactness
those
numbers
however
justify
the
claim
of
vast
antiquity
and
draw
us
to
the
conclusion
that
the
of
the
world
answers
to
the
in
magnitude
chapter
viii
conflict
respecting
the
criterion
of
truth
ancient
philosophy
declares
that
man
has
no
means
of
ascertaining
the
truth
differences
of
belief
arise
among
the
early
christians
an
ineffectual
attempt
is
made
to
remedy
them
by
miracle
and
ordeal
proof
introduced
the
papacy
resorts
to
auricular
confession
and
the
it
perpetrates
frightful
atrocities
for
the
suppression
of

the
discovery
of
the
pandects

of
the
canon
law
on
the
nature
of
it
becomes
more
scientific
the
reformation
establishes
the
rights
of
individual
catholicism
asserts
that
the
criterion
of
truth
is
in
the
church
it
restrains
the
reading
of
books
by
the
index
expurgatorius
and
combats
dissent
by
such
means
as
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
eve
examination
of
the
authenticity
of
the
pentateuch
as
the
protestant
spurious
character
of
those
books
for
science
the
criterion
of
truth
is
to
be
found
in
the
revelations
of
nature
for
the
protestant
it
is
in
the
scriptures
for
the
catholic
in
an
infallible
pope
what
is
truth
was
the
passionate
demand
of
a
roman
procurator
on
one
of
the
most
momentous
occasions
in
history
and
the
divine
person
who
stood
before
him
to
whom
the
interrogation
was
addressed
made
no
reply
unless
indeed
silence
contained
the
reply
often
and
vainly
had
that
demand
been
made
before
often
and
vainly
has
it
been
made
since
no
one
has
yet
given
a
satisfactory
answer
when
at
the
dawn
of
science
in
greece
the
ancient
religion
was
disappearing
like
a
mist
at
sunrise
the
pious
and
thoughtful
men
of
that
country
were
thrown
into
a
condition
of
intellectual
despair
anaxagoras
plaintively
exclaims
nothing
can
be
known
nothing
can
be
learned
nothing
can
be
certain
sense
is
limited
intellect
is
weak
life
is
short
xenophanes
tells
us
that
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
be
certain
even
when
we
utter
the
truth
parmenides
declares
that
the
very
constitution
of
man
prevents
him
from
ascertaining
absolute
truth
empedocles
affirms
that
all
philosophical
and
religious
systems
must
be
unreliable
because
we
have
no
criterion
by
which
to
test
them
democritus
asserts
that
even
things
that
are
true
can
not
impart
certainty
to
us
that
the
final
result
of
human
inquiry
is
the
discovery
that
man
is
incapable
of
absolute
knowledge
that
even
if
the
truth
be
in
his
possession
he
can
not
be
certain
of
it
pyrrho
bids
us
reflect
on
the
necessity
of
suspending
our
judgment
of
things
since
we
have
no
criterion
of
truth
so
deep
a
distrust
did
he
impart
to
his
followers
that
they
were
in
the
habit
of
saying
we
assert
nothing
no
not
even
that
we
assert
nothing
epicurus
taught
his
disciples
that
truth
can
never
be
determined
by
reason
arcesilaus
denying
both
intellectual
and
sensuous
knowledge
publicly
avowed
that
he
knew
nothing
not
even
his
own
ignorance
the
general
conclusion
to
which
greek
philosophy
came
was
this
that
in
view
of
the
contradiction
of
the
evidence
of
the
senses
we
can
not
distinguish
the
true
from
the
false
and
such
is
the
imperfection
of
reason
that
we
can
not
affirm
the
correctness
of
any
philosophical
deduction
it
might
be
supposed
that
a
revelation
from
god
to
man
would
come
with
such
force
and
clearness
as
to
settle
all
uncertainties
and
overwhelm
all
opposition
a
greek
philosopher
less
despairing
than
others
had
ventured
to
affirm
that
the
coexistence
of
two
forms
of
faith
both
claiming
to
be
revealed
by
the
omnipotent
god
proves
that
neither
of
them
is
true
but
let
us
remember
that
it
is
difficult
for
men
to
come
to
the
same
conclusion
as
regards
even
material
and
visible
things
unless
they
stand
at
the
same
point
of
view
if
discord
and
distrust
were
the
condition
of
philosophy
three
hundred
years
before
the
birth
of
christ
discord
and
distrust
were
the
condition
of
religion
three
hundred
years
after
his
death
this
is
what
hilary
the
bishop
of
poictiers
in
his
passage
written
about
the
time
of
the
nicene
council
says
it
is
a
thing
equally
deplorable
and
dangerous
that
there
are
as
many
creeds
as
opinions
among
men
as
many
doctrines
as
inclinations
and
as
many
sources
of
blasphemy
as
there
are
faults
among
us
because
we
make
creeds
arbitrarily
and
explain
them
as
arbitrarily
every
year
nay
every
moon
we
make
new
creeds
to
describe
invisible
mysteries
we
repent
of
what
we
have
done
we
defend
those
who
repent
we
anathematize
those
whom
we
defend
we
condemn
either
the
doctrines
of
others
in
ourselves
or
our
own
in
that
of
others
and
reciprocally
tearing
each
other
to
pieces
we
have
been
the
cause
of
each
other
ruin
these
are
not
mere
words
but
the
import
of
this
can
be
realized
fully
only
by
such
as
are
familiar
with
the
ecclesiastical
history
of
those
times
as
soon
as
the
first
fervor
of
christianity
as
a
system
of
benevolence
had
declined
dissensions
appeared
ecclesiastical
historians
assert
that
as
early
as
the
second
century
began
the
contest
between
faith
and
reason
religion
and
philosophy
piety
and
genius
to
compose
these
dissensions
to
obtain
some
authoritative
expression
some
criterion
of
truth
assemblies
for
consultation
were
resorted
to
which
eventually
took
the
form
of
councils
for
a
long
time
they
had
nothing
more
than
an
advisory
authority
but
when
in
the
fourth
century
christianity
had
attained
to
imperial
rule
their
dictates
became
compulsory
being
enforced
by
the
civil
power
by
this
the
whole
face
of
the
church
was
changed
oecumenical
councils
parliaments
of
christianity
consisting
of
delegates
from
all
the
churches
in

world
were
summoned
by
the
authority
of

either
personally
or
nominally

was
in
fact

mosheim
the
historian
to
whom
i
have
more
particularly
referred
above
speaking
of
these
times
remarks
that
there
was
nothing
to
exclude
the
ignorant
from
ecclesiastical
preferment
the
savage
and
illiterate
party
who
looked
on
all
kinds
of
learning
particularly
philosophy
as
pernicious
to
piety
was
increasing
and
accordingly
the
disputes
carried
on
in
the
council
of
nicea
offered
a
remarkable
example
of
the
greatest
ignorance
and
utter
confusion
of
ideas
particularly
in
the
language
and
explanations
of
those
who
approved
of
the
decisions
of
that
council
vast
as
its
influence
has
been
the
ancient
critics
are
neither
agreed
concerning
the
time
nor
place
in
which
it
was
assembled
the
number
of
those
who
sat
in
it
nor
the
bishop
who
presided
no
authentic
acts
of
its
famous
sentence
have
been
committed
to
writing
or
at
least
none
have
been
transmitted
to
our
times
the
church
had
now
become
what
in
the
language
of
modern
politicians
would
be
called
a
confederated
republic
the
will
of
the
council
was
determined
by
a
majority
vote
and
to
secure
that
all
manner
of
intrigues
and
impositions
were
resorted
to
the
influence
of
court
females
bribery
and
violence
were
not
spared
the
council
of
nicea
had
scarcely
adjourned
when
it
was
plain
to
all
impartial
men
that
as
a
method
of
establishing
a
criterion
of
truth
in
religious
matters
such
councils
were
a
total
failure
the
minority
had
no
rights
which
the
majority
need
respect
the
protest
of
many
good
men
that
a
mere
majority
vote
given
by
delegates
whose
right
to
vote
had
never
been
examined
and
authorized
could
not
be
received
as
ascertaining
absolute
truth
was
passed
over
with
contempt
and
the
consequence
was
that
council
was
assembled
against
council
and
their
jarring
and
contradictory
decrees
spread
perplexity
and
confusion
throughout
the
christian
world
in
the
fourth
century
alone
there
were
thirteen
councils
adverse
to
arius
fifteen
in
his
favor
and
seventeen
for
the
in
all
minorities
were
perpetually
attempting
to
use
the
weapon
which
majorities
had
abused
the
impartial
ecclesiastical
historian
above
quoted
moreover
says
that
two
monstrous
and
calamitous
errors
were
adopted
in
this
fourth
century
that
it
was
an
act
of
virtue
to
deceive
and
lie
when
by
that
means
the
interests
of
the
church
might
be
promoted
that
errors
in
religion
when
maintained
and
adhered
to
after
proper
admonition
were
punishable
with
civil
penalties
and
corporal
tortures
not
without
astonishment
can
we
look
back
at
what
in
those
times
were
popularly
regarded
as
criteria
of
truth
doctrines
were
considered
as
established
by
the
number
of
martyrs
who
had
professed
them
by
miracles
by
the
confession
of
demons
of
lunatics
or
of
persons
possessed
of
evil
spirits
thus
ambrose
in
his
disputes
with
the
arians
produced
men
possessed
by
devils
who
on
the
approach
of
the
relics
of
certain
martyrs
acknowledged
with
loud
cries
that
the
nicean
doctrine
of
the
three
persons
of
the
godhead
was
true
but
the
arians
charged
him
with
suborning
these
infernal
witnesses
with
a
weighty
bribe
already
ordeal
tribunals
were
making
their
appearance
during
the
following
six
centuries
they
were
held
as
a
final
resort
for
establishing
guilt
or
innocence
under
the
forms
of
trial
by
cold
water
by
duel
by
the
fire
by
the
cross
what
an
utter
ignorance
of
the
nature
of
evidence
and
its
laws
have
we
here
an
accused
man
sinks
or
swims
when
thrown
into
a
pond
of
water
he
is
burnt
or
escapes
unharmed
when
he
holds
a
piece
of
iron
in
his
hand
a
champion
whom
he
has
hired
is
vanquished
or
vanquishes
in
single
fight
he
can
keep
his
arms
outstretched
like
a
cross
or
fails
to
do
so
longer
than
his
accuser
and
his
innocence
or
guilt
of
some
imputed
crime
is
established
are
these
criteria
of
truth
is
it
surprising
that
all
europe
was
filled
with
imposture
miracles
during
those
ages
miracles
that
are
a
disgrace
to
the
of
man
but
the
inevitable
day
came
at
length
assertions
and
doctrines
based
upon
such
preposterous
evidence
were
involved
in
the
discredit
that
fell
upon
the
evidence
itself
as
the
thirteenth
century
is
approached
we
find
unbelief
in
all
directions
setting
in
first
it
is
plainly
seen
among
the
monastic
orders
then
it
spreads
rapidly
among
the
common
people
books
such
as
the
everlasting
gospel
appear
among
the
former
sects
such
as
the
catharists
waldenses
petrobrussians
arise
among
the
latter
they
agreed
in
this
that
the
public
and
established
religion
was
a
motley
system
of
errors
and
superstitions
and
that
the
dominion
which
the
pope
had
usurped
over
christians
was
unlawful
and
tyrannical
that
the
claim
put
forth
by
rome
that
the
bishop
of
rome
is
the
supreme
lord
of
the
universe
and
that
neither
princes
nor
bishops
civil
governors
nor
ecclesiastical
rulers
have
any
lawful
power
in
church
or
state
but
what
they
receive
from
him
is
utterly
without
foundation
and
a
usurpation
of
the
rights
of
man
to
withstand
this
flood
of
impiety
the
papal
government
established
two
institutions
the
inquisition
auricular
confession
the
latter
as
a
means
of
detection
the
former
as
a
tribunal
for
punishment
in
general
terms
the
commission
of
the
inquisition
was
to
extirpate
religious
dissent
by
terrorism
and
surround
heresy
with
the
most
horrible
associations
this
necessarily
implied
the
power
of
determining
what
constitutes
heresy
the
criterion
of
truth
was
thus
in
possession
of
this
tribunal
which
was
charged
to
discover
and
bring
to
judgment
heretics
lurking
in
towns
houses
cellars
woods
caves
and
fields
with
such
savage
alacrity
did
it
carry
out
its
object
of
protecting
the
interests
of
religion
that
between
and
it
had
punished
three
hundred
and
forty
thousand
persons
and
of
these
nearly
thousand
had
been
burnt
in
its
earlier
days
when
public
opinion
could
find
no
means
of
protesting
against
its
atrocities
it
often
put
to
death
without
appeal
on
the
very
day
that
they
were
accused
nobles
clerks
monks
hermits
and
lay
persons
of
every
rank
in
whatever
direction
thoughtful
men
looked
the
air
was
full
of
fearful
shadows
no
one
could
indulge
in
freedom
of
thought
without
expecting
punishment
so
dreadful
were
the
proceedings
of
the
inquisition
that
the
exclamation
of
pagliarici
was
the
exclamation
of
thousands
it
is
hardly
possible
for
a
man
to
be
a
christian
and
die
in
his
bed
the
inquisition
destroyed
the
sectaries
of
southern
france
in
the
thirteenth
century
its
unscrupulous
atrocities
extirpated
protestantism
in
italy
and
spain
nor
did
it
confine
itself
to
religious
affairs
it
engaged
in
the
suppression
of
political
discontent
nicolas
eymeric
who
was
of
the
kingdom
of
aragon
for
nearly
fifty
years
and
who
died
in
has
left
a
frightful
statement
of
its
conduct
and
appalling
cruelties
in
his
directorium
inquisitorum
this
disgrace
of
christianity
and
indeed
of
the
human
race
had
different
constitutions
in
different
countries
the
papal
inquisition
continued
the
tyranny
and
eventually
superseded
the
old
episcopal
inquisitions
the
authority
of
the
bishops
was
unceremoniously
put
aside
by
the
officers
of
the
pope
by
the
action
of
the
fourth
lateran
council
the
power
of
the
inquisition
was
frightfully
increased
the
necessity
of
private
confession
to
a
priest
auricular
confession
being
at
that
time
formally
established
this
so
far
as
domestic
life
was
concerned
gave
omnipresence
and
omniscience
to
the
inquisition
not
a
man
was
safe
in
the
hands
of
the
priest
who
at
the
confessional
could
extract
or
extort
from
them
their
most
secret
thoughts
his
wife
and
his
servants
were
turned
into
spies
summoned
before
the
dread
tribunal
he
was
simply
informed
that
he
lay
under
strong
suspicions
of
heresy
no
accuser
was
named
but
the
the
the
boot
and
wedge
or
other
enginery
of
torture
soon
supplied
that
defect
and
innocent
or
guilty
he
accused
himself
notwithstanding
all
this
power
the
inquisition
failed
of
its
purpose
when
the
heretic
could
no
longer
confront
it
he
evaded
it
a
dismal
disbelief
stealthily
pervaded
all
europe
a
denial
of
providence
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
of
human
and
that
man
can
possibly
resist
the
absolute
necessity
the
destiny
which
envelops
him
ideas
such
as
these
were
cherished
in
silence
by
multitudes
of
persons
driven
to
them
by
the
tyrannical
acts
of
ecclesiasticism
in
spite
of
persecution
the
waldenses
still
survived
to
propagate
their
declaration
that
the
roman
church
since
constantine
had
degenerated
from
its
purity
and
sanctity
to
protest
against
the
sale
of
indulgences
which
they
said
had
nearly
abolished
prayer
fasting
alms
to
affirm
that
it
was
utterly
useless
to
pray
for
the
souls
of
the
dead
since
they
must
already
have
gone
either
to
heaven
or
hell
though
it
was
generally
believed
that
philosophy
or
science
was
pernicious
to
the
interests
of
christianity
or
true
piety
the
mohammedan
literature
then
prevailing
in
spain
was
making
converts
among
all
classes
of
society
we
see
very
plainly
its
influence
in
many
of
the
sects
that
then
arose
thus
the
brethren
and
sisters
of
the
free
spirit
held
that
the
universe
came
by
emanation
from
god
and
would
finally
return
to
him
by
absorption
that
rational
souls
are
so
many
portions
of
the
supreme
deity
and
that
the
universe
considered
as
one
great
whole
is
god
these
are
ideas
that
can
only
be
entertained
in
an
advanced
intellectual
condition
of
this
sect
it
is
said
that
many
suffered
burning
with
unclouded
serenity
with
triumphant
feelings
of
cheerfulness
and
joy
their
orthodox
enemies
accused
them
of
gratifying
their
passions
at
midnight
assemblages
in
darkened
rooms
to
which
both
sexes
in
a
condition
of
nudity
repaired
a
similar
accusation
as
is
well
known
was
brought
against
the
primitive
christians
by
the
fashionable
society
of
rome
the
influences
of
the
averroistic
philosophy
were
apparent
in
many
of
these
sects
that
mohammedan
system
considered
from
a
christian
point
of
view
led
to
the
heretical
belief
that
the
end
of
the
precepts
of
christianity
is
the
union
of
the
soul
with
the
supreme
being
that
god
and
nature
have
the
same
relations
to
each
other
as
the
soul
and
the
body
that
there
is
but
one
individual
intelligence
and
that
one
soul
performs
all
the
spiritual
and
rational
functions
in
all
the
human
race
when
subsequently
toward
the
time
of
the
reformation
the
italian
averroists
were
required
by
the
inquisition
to
give
an
account
of
themselves
they
attempted
to
show
that
there
is
a
wide
distinction
between
philosophical
and
religious
truth
that
things
may
be
philosophically
true
and
yet
theologically
false
an
exculpatory
device
condemned
at
length
by
the
lateran
council
in
the
time
of
leo
x
but
in
spite
of
auricular
confession
and
the
inquisition
these
heretical
tendencies
survived
it
has
been
truly
said
that
at
the
epoch
of
the
reformation
there
lay
concealed
in
many
parts
of
europe
persons
who
entertained
the
most
virulent
enmity
against
christianity
in
this
pernicious
class
were
many
aristotelians
such
as
pomponatius
many
philosophers
and
wits
such
as
bodin
rabelais
montaigne
many
italians
as
leo
bembo
bruno
began
to
fall
into
discredit
during
the
eleventh
and
twelfth
centuries
the
sarcasms
of
the
philosophers
had
forcibly
drawn
the
attention
of
many
of
the
more
enlightened
ecclesiastics
to
its
illusory
nature
the
discovery
of
the
pandects
of
justinian
at
amalfi
in
doubtless
exerted
a
very
powerful
influence
in
promoting
the
study
of
roman
jurisprudence
and
disseminating
better
notions
as
to
the
character
of
legal
or
philosophical
evidence
hallam
has
cast
some
doubt
on
the
story
of
this
discovery
but
he
admits
that
the
celebrated
copy
in
the
laurentian
library
at
florence
is
the
only
one
containing
the
entire
fifty
books
twenty
years
subsequently
the
monk
gratian
collected
together
the
various
papal
edicts
the
canons
of
councils
the
declarations
of
the
fathers
and
doctors
of
the
church
in
a
volume
called
the
decretum
considered
as
the
earliest
authority
in
canon
law
in
the
next
century
gregory
ix
published
five
books
of
decretals
and
boniface
viii
subsequently
added
a
sixth
to
these
followed
the
clementine
constitutions
a
seventh
book
of
decretals
and
a
book
of
institutes
published
together
by
gregory
in
under
the
title
of
corpus
juris
canonici
the
canon
law
had
gradually
gained
enormous
power
through
the
control
it
had
obtained
over
wills
the
guardianship
of
orphans
marriages
and
divorces
the
rejection
of
and
the
substitution
of
legal
evidence
in
its
stead
accelerated
the
approach
of
the
reformation
no
longer
was
it
possible
to
admit
the
requirement
which
in
former
days
anselm
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
in
his
treatise
cur
deus
homo
had
enforced
that
we
must
first
believe
without
examination
and
may
afterward
endeavor
to
understand
what
we
have
thus
believed
when
cajetan
said
to
luther
thou
must
believe
that
one
single
drop
of
christ
blood
is
sufficient
to
redeem
the
whole
human
race
and
the
remaining
quantity
that
was
shed
in
the
garden
and
on
the
cross
was
left
as
a
legacy
to
the
pope
to
be
a
treasure
from
which
indulgences
were
to
be
drawn
the
soul
of
the
sturdy
german
monk
revolted
against
such
a
monstrous
assertion
nor
would
he
have
believed
it
though
a
thousand
miracles
had
been
worked
in
its
support
this
shameful
practice
of
selling
indulgences
for
the
commission
of
sin
originated
among
the
bishops
who
when
they
had
need
of
money
for
their
private
pleasures
obtained
it
in
that
way
abbots
and
monks
to
whom
this
gainful
commerce
was
denied
raised
funds
by
carrying
about
relics
in
solemn
procession
and
charging
a
fee
for
touching
them
the
popes
in
their
pecuniary
straits
perceiving
how
lucrative
the
practice
might
become
deprived
the
bishops
of
the
right
of
making
such
sales
and
appropriated
it
to
themselves
establishing
agencies
chiefly
among
the
mendicant
orders
for
the
traffic
among
these
orders
there
was
a
sharp
competition
each
boasting
of
the
superior
value
of
its
indulgences
through
its
greater
influence
at
the
court
of
heaven
its
familiar
connection
with
the
virgin
mary
and
the
saints
in
glory
even
against
luther
himself
who
had
been
an
augustinian
monk
a
calumny
was
circulated
that
he
was
first
alienated
from
the
church
by
a
traffic
of
this
kind
having
been
conferred
on
the
dominicans
instead
of
on
his
own
order
at
the
time
when
leo
was
raising
funds
by
this
means
for
building
peter
at
rome
and
there
is
reason
to
think
that
leo
himself
in
the
earlier
stages
of
the
reformation
attached
weight
to
that
allegation
indulgences
were
thus
the
immediate
inciting
cause
of
the
reformation
but
very
soon
there
came
into
light
the
real
principle
that
was
animating
the
controversy
it
lay
in
the
question
does
the
bible
owe
its
authenticity
to
the
church
or
does
the
church
owe
her
authenticity
to
the
bible
where
is
the
criterion
of
truth
it
is
not
necessary
for
me
here
to
relate
the
well
known
particulars
of
that
controversy
the
desolating
wars
and
scenes
of
blood
to
which
it
gave
rise
how
luther
posted
on
the
door
of
the
cathedral
of
wittemberg
theses
and
was
summoned
to
rome
to
answer
for
his
offense
how
he
appealed
from
the
pope
at
the
time
to
the
pope
when
he
should
have
been
better
instructed
how
he
was
condemned
as
a
heretic
and
thereupon
appealed
to
a
general
council
how
through
the
disputes
about
purgatory
transubstantiation
auricular
confession
absolution
the
fundamental
idea
which
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
movement
came
into
relief
the
right
of
individual
judgment
how
luther
was
now
excommunicated
and
in
defiance
burnt
the
bull
of
excommunication
and
the
volumes
of
the
canon
law
which
he
denounced
as
aiming
at
the
subversion
of
all
civil
government
and
the
exaltation
of
the
papacy
how
by
this
skillful
manoeuvre
he
brought
over
many
of
the
german
princes
to
his
views
how
summoned
before
the
imperial
diet
at
worms
he
refused
to
retract
and
while
he
was
bidden
in
the
castle
of
wartburg
his
doctrines
were
spreading
and
a
reformation
under
zwingli
broke
out
in
switzerland
how
the
principle
of
sectarian
decomposition
embedded
in
the
movement
gave
rise
to
rivalries
and
dissensions
between
the
germans
and
the
swiss
and
even
divided
the
latter
among
themselves
under
the
leadership
of
zwingli
and
of
calvin
how
the
conference
of
marburg
the
diet
of
spires
and
that
at
augsburg
failed
to
compose
the
troubles
and
eventually
the
german
reformation
assumed
a
political
organization
at
smalcalde
the
quarrels
between
the
lutherans
and
the
calvinists
gave
hopes
to
rome
that
she
might
recover
her
losses
leo
was
not
slow
to
discern
that
the
lutheran
reformation
was
something
more
serious
than
a
squabble
among
some
monks
about
the
profits
of
and
the
papacy
set
itself
seriously
at
work
to
overcome
the
revolters
it
instigated
the
frightful
wars
that
for
so
many
years
desolated
europe
and
left
animosities
which
neither
the
treaty
of
westphalia
nor
the
council
of
trent
after
eighteen
years
of
debate
could
compose
no
one
can
read
without
a
shudder
the
attempts
that
were
made
to
extend
the
inquisition
in
foreign
countries
all
europe
catholic
and
protestant
was
at
the
huguenot
massacre
of
bartholomew
eve
for
perfidy
and
atrocity
it
has
no
equal
in
the
annals
of
the
world
the
desperate
attempt
in
which
the
papacy
had
been
engaged
to
put
down
its
opponents
by
instigating
civil
wars
massacres
and
assassinations
proved
to
be
altogether
abortive
nor
had
the
council
of
trent
any
better
result
ostensibly
summoned
to
correct
illustrate
and
fix
with
perspicacity
the
doctrine
of
the
church
to
restore
the
vigor
of
its
discipline
and
to
reform
the
lives
of
its
ministers
it
was
so
manipulated
that
a
large
majority
of
its
members
were
italians
and
under
the
influence
of
the
pope
hence
the
protestants
could
not
possibly
accept
its
decisions
the
issue
of
the
reformation
was
the
acceptance
by
all
the
protestant
churches
of
the
dogma
that
the
bible
is
a
sufficient
guide
for
every
christian
man
tradition
was
rejected
and
the
right
of
private
interpretation
assured
it
was
thought
that
the
criterion
of
truth
had
at
length
been
obtained
the
authority
thus
imputed
to
the
scriptures
was
not
restricted
to
matters
of
a
purely
religious
or
moral
kind
it
extended
over
philosophical
facts
and
to
the
interpretation
of
nature
many
went
as
far
as
in
the
old
times
epiphanius
had
done
he
believed
that
the
bible
contained
a
complete
system
of
mineralogy
the
reformers
would
tolerate
no
science
that
was
not
in
accordance
with
genesis
among
them
there
were
many
who
maintained
that
religion
and
piety
could
never
flourish
unless
separated
from
learning
and
science
the
fatal
maxim
that
the
bible
contained
the
sum
and
substance
of
all
knowledge
useful
or
possible
to
man
a
maxim
employed
with
such
pernicious
effect
of
old
by
tertullian
and
by
augustine
and
which
had
so
often
been
enforced
by
papal
authority
was
still
strictly
insisted
upon
the
leaders
of
the
reformation
luther
and
melanchthon
were
determined
to
banish
philosophy
from
the
church
luther
declared
that
the
study
of
aristotle
is
wholly
useless
his
vilification
of
that
greek
philosopher
knew
no
bounds
he
is
says
luther
truly
a
devil
a
horrid
calumniator
a
wicked
sycophant
a
prince
of
darkness
a
real
apollyon
a
beast
a
most
horrid
impostor
on
mankind
one
in
whom
there
is
scarcely
any
philosophy
a
public
and
professed
liar
a
goat
a
complete
epicure
this
twice
execrable
aristotle
the
schoolmen
were
so
luther
said
locusts
caterpillars
frogs
lice
he
entertained
an
abhorrence
for
them
these
opinions
though
not
so
emphatically
expressed
were
entertained
by
calvin
so
far
as
science
is
concerned
nothing
is
owed
to
the
reformation
the
procrustean
bed
of
the
pentateuch
was
still
before
her
in
the
annals
of
christianity
the
most
day
is
that
in
which
she
separated
herself
from
science
she
compelled
origen
at
that
time
its
chief
representative
and
supporter
in
the
church
to
abandon
his
charge
in
alexandria
and
retire
to
caesarea
in
vain
through
many
subsequent
centuries
did
her
leading
men
spend
themselves
in
as
the
phrase
then
went
drawing
forth
the
internal
juice
and
marrow
of
the
scriptures
for
the
explaining
of
things
universal
history
from
the
third
to
the
sixteenth
century
shows
with
what
result
the
dark
ages
owe
their
darkness
to
this
fatal
policy
here
and
there
it
is
true
there
were
great
men
such
as
frederick
ii
and
alphonso
who
standing
at
a
very
elevated
and
general
point
of
view
had
detected
the
value
of
learning
to
civilization
and
in
the
midst
of
the
dreary
prospect
that
ecclesiasticism
had
created
around
them
had
recognized
that
science
alone
can
improve
the
social
condition
of
man
the
infliction
of
the
for
difference
of
opinion
was
still
resorted
to
when
calvin
caused
servetus
to
be
burnt
at
geneva
it
was
obvious
to
every
one
that
the
spirit
of
persecution
was
unimpaired
the
offense
of
that
philosopher
lay
in
his
belief
this
was
that
the
genuine
doctrines
of
christianity
had
been
lost
even
before
the
time
of
the
council
of
nicea
that
the
holy
ghost
animates
the
whole
system
of
nature
like
a
soul
of
the
world
and
that
with
the
christ
it
will
be
absorbed
at
the
end
of
all
things
into
the
substance
of
the
deity
from
which
they
had
emanated
for
this
he
was
roasted
to
death
over
a
slow
fire
was
there
any
distinction
between
this
protestant
and
the
catholic
one
of
vanini
who
was
burnt
at
toulouse
by
the
inquisition
in
for
his
dialogues
concerning
nature
the
invention
of
printing
the
dissemination
of
books
had
introduced
a
class
of
dangers
which
the
persecution
of
the
inquisition
could
not
reach
in
pope
paul
iv
instituted
the
congregation
of
the
index
expurgatorius
its
duty
is
to
examine
books
and
manuscripts
intended
for
publication
and
to
decide
whether
the
people
may
be
permitted
to
read
them
to
correct
those
books
of
which
the
errors
are
not
numerous
and
which
contain
certain
useful
and
salutary
truths
so
as
to
bring
them
into
harmony
with
the
doctrines
of
the
church
to
condemn
those
of
which
the
principles
are
heretical
and
pernicious
and
to
grant
the
peculiar
privilege
of
perusing
heretical
books
to
certain
persons
this
congregation
which
is
sometimes
held
in
presence
of
the
pope
but
generally
in
the
palace
of
the
has
a
more
extensive
jurisdiction
than
that
of
the
inquisition
as
it
not
only
takes
cognizance
of
those
books
that
contain
doctrines
contrary
to
the
roman
catholic
faith
but
of
those
that
concern
the
duties
of
morality
the
discipline
of
the
church
the
interests
of
society
its
name
is
derived
from
the
alphabetical
tables
or
indexes
of
heretical
books
and
authors
composed
by
its
appointment
the
index
expurgatorius
of
prohibited
books
at
first
indicated
those
works
which
it
was
unlawful
to
read
but
on
this
being
found
insufficient
whatever
was
not
permitted
was
prohibited
an
audacious
attempt
to
prevent
all
knowledge
except
such
as
suited
the
purposes
of
the
church
from
reaching
the
people
the
two
rival
divisions
of
the
christian
church
protestant
and
catholic
were
thus
in
accord
on
one
point
to
tolerate
no
science
except
such
as
they
considered
to
be
agreeable
to
the
scriptures
the
catholic
being
in
possession
of
centralized
power
could
make
its
decisions
respected
wherever
its
sway
was
acknowledged
and
enforce
the
monitions
of
the
index
expurgatorius
the
protestant
whose
influence
was
diffused
among
many
foci
in
different
nations
could
not
act
in
such
a
direct
and
resolute
manner
its
mode
of
procedure
was
by
raising
a
theological
odium
against
an
offender
to
put
him
under
a
social
ban
a
course
perhaps
not
less
effectual
than
the
other
as
we
have
seen
in
former
chapters
an
antagonism
between
religion
and
science
had
existed
from
the
earliest
days
of
christianity
on
every
occasion
permitting
its
display
it
may
be
detected
through
successive
centuries
we
witness
it
in
the
downfall
of
the
alexandrian
museum
in
the
cases
of
erigena
and
wiclif
in
the
contemptuous
rejection
by
the
heretics
of
the
thirteenth
century
of
the
scriptural
account
of
the
creation
but
it
was
not
until
the
epoch
of
copernicus
kepler
and
galileo
that
the
efforts
of
science
to
burst
from
the
thraldom
in
which
she
was
fettered
became
uncontrollable
in
all
countries
the
political
power
of
the
church
had
greatly
declined
her
leading
men
perceived
that
the
cloudy
foundation
on
which
she
had
stood
was
dissolving
away
repressive
measures
against
her
antagonists
in
old
times
resorted
to
with
effect
could
be
no
longer
advantageously
employed
to
her
interests
the
burning
of
a
philosopher
here
and
there
did
more
harm
than
good
in
her
great
conflict
with
astronomy
a
conflict
in
which
galileo
stands
as
the
central
figure
she
received
an
utter
overthrow
and
as
we
have
seen
when
the
immortal
work
of
newton
was
printed
she
could
offer
no
resistance
though
leibnitz
affirmed
in
the
face
of
europe
that
newton
had
robbed
the
deity
of
some
of
his
most
excellent
attributes
and
had
sapped
the
foundation
of
natural
religion
from
the
time
of
newton
to
our
own
time
the
divergence
of
science
from
the
dogmas
of
the
church
has
continually
increased
the
church
declared
that
the
earth
is
the
central
and
most
important
body
in
the
universe
that
the
sun
and
moon
and
stars
are
tributary
to
it
on
these
points
she
was
worsted
by
astronomy
she
affirmed
that
a
universal
deluge
had
covered
the
earth
that
the
only
surviving
animals
were
such
as
had
been
saved
in
an
ark
in
this
her
error
was
established
by
geology
she
taught
that
there
was
a
first
man
who
some
six
or
eight
thousand
years
ago
was
suddenly
created
or
called
into
existence
in
a
condition
of
physical
and
moral
perfection
and
from
that
condition
he
fell
but
anthropology
has
shown
that
human
beings
existed
far
back
in
geological
time
and
in
a
savage
state
but
little
better
than
that
of
the
brute
many
good
and
men
have
attempted
to
reconcile
the
statements
of
genesis
with
the
discoveries
of
science
but
it
is
in
vain
the
divergence
has
increased
so
much
that
it
has
become
an
absolute
opposition
one
of
the
antagonists
must
give
way
may
we
not
then
be
permitted
to
examine
the
authenticity
of
this
book
which
since
the
second
century
has
been
put
forth
as
the
criterion
of
scientific
truth
to
maintain
itself
in
a
position
so
exalted
it
must
challenge
human
criticism
in
the
early
christian
ages
many
of
the
most
eminent
fathers
of
the
church
had
serious
doubts
respecting
the
authorship
of
the
entire
pentateuch
i
have
not
space
in
the
limited
compass
of
these
pages
to
present
in
detail
the
facts
and
arguments
that
were
then
and
have
since
been
adduced
the
literature
of
the
subject
is
now
very
extensive
i
may
however
refer
the
reader
to
the
work
of
the
pious
and
learned
dean
prideaux
on
the
old
and
new
testament
connected
a
work
which
is
one
of
the
literary
ornaments
of
the
last
century
he
will
also
find
the
subject
more
recently
and
exhaustively
discussed
by
bishop
colenso
the
following
paragraphs
will
convey
a
sufficiently
distinct
impression
of
the
present
state
of
the
controversy
the
pentateuch
is
affirmed
to
have
been
written
by
moses
under
the
influence
of
divine
inspiration
considered
thus
as
a
record
vouchsafed
and
dictated
by
the
almighty
it
commands
not
only
scientific
but
universal
consent
but
here
in
the
first
place
it
may
be
demanded
who
or
what
is
it
that
has
put
forth
this
great
claim
in
its
behalf
not
the
work
itself
it
nowhere
claims
the
authorship
of
one
man
or
makes
the
impious
declaration
that
it
is
the
writing
of
almighty
god
not
until
after
the
second
century
was
there
any
such
extravagant
demand
on
human
credulity
it
originated
not
among
the
higher
ranks
of
christian
philosophers
but
among
the
more
fervid
fathers
of
the
church
whose
own
writings
prove
them
to
have
been
unlearned
and
uncritical
persons
every
age
from
the
second
century
to
our
times
has
offered
men
of
great
ability
both
christian
and
jewish
who
have
altogether
repudiated
these
claims
their
decision
has
been
founded
upon
the
intrinsic
evidence
of
the
books
themselves
these
furnish
plain
indications
of
at
least
two
distinct
authors
who
have
been
respectively
termed
elohistic
and
jehovistic
hupfeld
maintains
that
the
jehovistic
narrative
bears
marks
of
having
been
a
second
original
record
wholly
independent
of
the
elohistic
the
two
sources
from
which
the
narratives
have
been
derived
are
in
many
respects
contradictory
of
each
other
moreover
it
is
asserted
that
the
books
of
the
pentateuch
are
never
ascribed
to
moses
in
the
inscriptions
of
hebrew
manuscripts
or
in
printed
copies
of
the
hebrew
bible
nor
are
they
styled
books
of
moses
in
the
septuagint
or
vulgate
but
only
in
modern
translations
it
is
clear
that
they
can
not
be
imputed
to
the
sole
authorship
of
moses
since
they
record
his
death
it
is
clear
that
they
were
not
written
until
many
hundred
years
after
that
event
since
they
contain
references
to
facts
which
did
not
occur
until
after
the
establishment
of
the
government
of
kings
among
the
jews
no
man
may
dare
to
impute
them
to
the
inspiration
of
almighty
god
their
inconsistencies
incongruities
contradictions
and
impossibilities
as
exposed
by
many
learned
and
pious
moderns
both
german
and
english
are
so
great
it
is
the
decision
of
these
critics
that
genesis
is
a
narrative
based
upon
legends
that
exodus
is
not
historically
true
that
the
whole
pentateuch
is
unhistoric
and
it
contains
the
most
extraordinary
contradictions
and
impossibilities
sufficient
to
involve
the
credibility
of
the
whole
imperfections
so
many
and
so
conspicuous
that
they
would
destroy
the
authenticity
of
any
modern
historical
work
hengstenberg
in
his
dissertations
on
the
genuineness
of
the
pentateuch
says
it
is
the
unavoidable
fate
of
a
spurious
historical
work
of
any
length
to
be
involved
in
contradictions
this
must
be
the
case
to
a
very
great
extent
with
the
pentateuch
if
it
be
not
genuine
if
the
pentateuch
is
spurious
its
histories
and
laws
have
been
fabricated
in
successive
portions
and
were
committed
to
writing
in
the
course
of
many
centuries
by
different
individuals
from
such
a
mode
of
origination
a
mass
of
contradictions
is
inseparable
and
the
improving
hand
of
a
later
editor
could
never
be
capable
of
entirely
obliterating
them
to
the
above
conclusions
i
may
add
that
we
are
expressly
told
by
ezra
esdras
ii
that
he
himself
aided
by
five
other
persons
wrote
these
books
in
the
space
of
forty
days
he
says
that
at
the
time
of
the
babylonian
captivity
the
ancient
sacred
writings
of
the
jews
were
burnt
and
gives
a
particular
detail
of
the
circumstances
under
which
these
were
composed
he
sets
forth
that
he
undertook
to
write
all
that
had
been
done
in
the
world
since
the
beginning
it
may
be
said
that
the
books
of
esdras
are
apocryphal
but
in
return
it
may
be
demanded
has
that
conclusion
been
reached
on
evidence
that
will
withstand
modern
criticism
in
the
early
ages
of
christianity
when
the
story
of
the
fall
of
man
was
not
considered
as
essential
to
the
christian
system
and
the
doctrine
of
the
atonement
had
not
attained
that
precision
which
anselm
eventually
gave
it
it
was
very
generally
admitted
by
the
fathers
of
the
church
that
ezra
probably
did
so
compose
the
pentateuch
thus
jerome
says
sive
mosem
dicere
volueris
auctorem
pentateuchi
sive
esdram
ejusdem
instauratorem
operis
non
recuso
clemens
alexandrinus
says
that
when
these
books
had
been
destroyed
in
the
captivity
of
nebuchadnezzar
esdras
having
become
inspired
prophetically
reproduced
them
irenaeus
says
the
same
the
incidents
contained
in
genesis
from
the
first
to
the
tenth
chapters
inclusive
chapters
which
in
their
bearing
upon
science
are
of
more
importance
than
other
portions
of
the
pentateuch
have
been
obviously
compiled
from
short
fragmentary
legends
of
various
authorship
to
the

abruptly
the

history
of

in

eleventh
chapter
at
that
point
his
universal
history
ceases
he
occupies
himself
with
the
story
of
one
family
the
descendants
of
shem
it
is
of
this
restriction
that
the
duke
of
argyll
in
his
book
on
primeval
man
very
graphically
says
in
the
genealogy
of
the
family
of
shem
we
have
a
list
of
names
which
are
names
and
nothing
more
to
us
it
is
a
genealogy
which
neither
does
nor
pretends
to
do
more
than
to
trace
the
order
of
succession
among
a
few
families
only
out
of
the
millions
then
already
existing
in
the
world
nothing
but
this
order
of
succession
is
given
nor
is
it
at
all
certain
that
this
order
is
consecutive
or
complete
nothing
is
told
us
of
all
that
lay
behind
that
curtain
of
thick
darkness
in
front
of
which
these
names
are
made
to
pass
and
yet
there
are
as
it
were
momentary
liftings
through
which
we
have
glimpses
of
great
movements
which
were
going
on
and
had
been
long
going
on
beyond
no
shapes
are
distinctly
seen
even
the
direction
of
those
movements
can
only
be
guessed
but
voices
are
heard
which
are
as
the
voices
of
many
waters
i
agree
in
the
opinion
of
hupfeld
that
the
discovery
that
the
pentateuch
is
put
together
out
of
various
sources
or
original
documents
is
beyond
all
doubt
not
only
one
of
the
most
important
and
most
pregnant
with
consequences
for
the
interpretation
of
the
historical
books
of
the
old
testament
or
rather
for
the
whole
of
theology
and
history
but
it
is
also
one
of
the
most
certain
discoveries
which
have
been
made
in
the
domain
of
criticism
and
the
history
of
literature
whatever
the
anticritical
party
may
bring
forward
to
the
contrary
it
will
maintain
itself
and
not
retrograde
again
through
any
thing
so
long
as
there
exists
such
a
thing
as
criticism
and
it
will
not
be
easy
for
a
reader
upon
the
stage
of
culture
on
which
we
stand
in
the
present
day
if
he
goes
to
the
examination
unprejudiced
and
with
an
uncorrupted
power
of
appreciating
the
truth
to
be
able
to
ward
off
its
influence
what
then
shall
we
give
up
these
books
does
not
the
admission
that
the
narrative
of
the
fall
in
eden
is
legendary
carry
with
it
the
surrender
of
that
most
solemn
and
sacred
of
christian
doctrines
the
atonement
let
us
reflect
on
this
christianity
in
its
earliest
days
when
it
was
converting
and
conquering
the
world
knew
little
or
nothing
about
that
doctrine
we
have
seen
that
in
his
apology
tertullian
did
not
think
it
worth
his
while
to
mention
it
it
originated
among
the
gnostic
heretics
it
was
not
admitted
by
the
alexandrian
theological
school
it
was
never
prominently
advanced
by
the
fathers
it
was
not
brought
into
its
present
commanding
position
until
the
time
of
anselm
philo
judaeus
speaks
of
the
story
of
the
fall
as
symbolical
origen
regarded
it
as
an
allegory
perhaps
some
of
the
protestant
churches
may
with
reason
be
accused
of
inconsistency
since
in
part
they
consider
it
as
mythical
in
part
real
but
if
with
them
we
admit
that
the
serpent
is
symbolical
of
satan
does
not
that
cast
an
air
of
allegory
over
the
whole
narrative
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
the
christian
church
has
burdened
itself
with
the
defense
of
these
books
and
voluntarily
made
itself
answerable
for
their
manifest
contradictions
and
errors
their
vindication
if
it
were
possible
should
have
been
resigned
to
the
jews
among
whom
they
originated
and
by
whom
they
have
been
transmitted
to
us
still
more
it
is
to
be
deeply
regretted
that
the
pentateuch
a
production
so
imperfect
as
to
be
unable
to
stand
the
touch
of
modern
criticism
should
be
put
forth
as
the
arbiter
of
science
let
it
be
remembered
that
the
exposure
of
the
true
character
of
these
books
has
been
made
not
by
captious
enemies
but
by
pious
and
learned
churchmen
some
of
them
of
the
highest
dignity
while
thus
the
protestant
churches
have
insisted
on
the
acknowledgment
of
the
scriptures
as
the
criterion
of
truth
the
catholic
has
in
our
own
times
declared
the
infallibility
of
the
pope
it
may
be
said
that
this
infallibility
applies
only
to
moral
or
religious
things
but
where
shall
the
line
of
separation
be
drawn
onmiscience
can
not
be
limited
to
a
restricted
group
of
questions
in
its
very
nature
it
implies
the
knowledge
of
all
and
infallibility
means
omniscience
doubtless
if
the
fundamental
principles
of
italian
christianity
be
admitted
their
logical
issue
is
an
infallible
pope
there
is
no
need
to
dwell
on
the
unphilosophical
nature
of
this
conception
it
is
destroyed
by
an
examination
of
the
political
history
of
the
papacy
and
the
biography
of
the
popes
the
former
exhibits
all
the
errors
and
mistakes
to
which
institutions
of
a
confessedly
human
character
have
been
found
liable
the
latter
is
only
too
frequently
a
story
of
sin
and
shame
it
was
not
possible
that
the
authoritative
promulgation
of
the
dogma
of
papal
infallibility
should
meet
among
enlightened
catholics
universal
acceptance
serious
and
dissent
has
been
produced
a
doctrine
so
revolting
to
could
not
find
any
other
result
there
are
many
who
affirm
that
if
infallibility
exists
anywhere
it
is
in
oecumenical
councils
and
yet
such
councils
have
not
always
agreed
with
each
other
there
are
also
many
who
remember
that
councils
have
deposed
popes
and
have
passed
judgment
on
their
clamors
and
contentions
not
without
reason
do
protestants
demand
what
proof
can
be
given
that
infallibility
exists
in
the
church
at
all
what
proof
is
there
that
the
church
has
ever
been
fairly
or
justly
represented
in
any
council
and
why
should
the
truth
be
ascertained
by
the
vote
of
a
majority
rather
than
by
that
of
a
minority
how
often
it
has
happened
that
one
man
standing
at
the
right
point
of
view
has
descried
the
truth
and
after
having
been
denounced
and
persecuted
by
all
others
they
have
eventually
been
constrained
to
adopt
his
declarations
of
many
great
discoveries
has
not
this
been
the
history
it
is
not
for
science
to
compose
these
contesting
claims
it
is
not
for
her
to
determine
whether
the
criterion
of
truth
for
the
religious
man
shall
be
found
in
the
bible
or
in
the
oecumenical
council
or
in
the
pope
she
only
asks
the
right
which
she
so
willingly
accords
to
others
of
adopting
a
criterion
of
her
own
if
she
regards
unhistorical
legends
with
disdain
if
she
considers
the
vote
of
a
majority
in
the
ascertainment
of
truth
with
supreme
indifference
if
she
leaves
the
claim
of
infallibility
in
any
human
being
to
be
vindicated
by
the
stern
logic
of
coming
events
the
cold
impassiveness
which
in
these
matters
she
maintains
is
what
she
displays
toward
her
own
doctrines
without
hesitation
she
would
give
up
the
theories

she

controversy
respecting
the
government
of

there
are
two
conceptions
of

by

maintained
by

evidences
of
the
control
of

and
in
the
development
of
the
animal
and
plant
they
arose
by
evolution
not
by
creation
the
reign
of

is
exhibited
by
the
historic
career
of
human
societies
and
in
the
case
of
individual
man
partial
adoption
of
this
view
by
some
of
the
reformed
churches
two
interpretations
may
be
given
of
the
mode
of
government
of
the
world
it
may
be
by
incessant
divine
interventions
or
by
the
operation
of
unvarying
law
to
the
adoption
of
the
former
a
priesthood
will
always
incline
since
it
must
desire
to
be
considered
as
standing
between
the
prayer
of
the
votary
and
the
providential
act
its
importance
is
magnified
by
the
power
it
claims
of
determining
what
that
act
shall
be
in
the
pre
christian
roman
religion
the
grand
office
of
the
priesthood
was
the
discovery
of
future
events
by
oracles
omens
or
an
inspection
of
the
entrails
of
animals
and
by
the
offering
of
sacrifices
to
propitiate
the
gods
in
the
later
the
christian
times
a
higher
power
was
claimed
the
clergy
asserting
that
by
their
intercessions
they
could
regulate
the
course
of
affairs
avert
dangers
secure
benefits
work
miracles
and
even
change
the
order
of
nature
not
without
reason
therefore
did
they
look
upon
the
doctrine
of
government
by
unvarying
law
with
disfavor
it
seemed
to
depreciate
their
dignity
to
lessen
their
importance
to
them
there
was
something
shocking
in
a
god
who
can
not
be
swayed
by
human
entreaty
a
cold
passionless
divinity
something
frightful
in
fatalism
destiny
but
the
orderly
movement
of
the
heavens
could
not
fail
in
all
ages
to
make
a
deep
impression
on
thoughtful
observers
the
rising
and
setting
of
the
sun
the
increasing
or
diminishing
light
of
the
day
the
waxing
and
waning
of
the
moon
the
return
of
the
seasons
in
their
proper
courses
the
measured
march
of
the
wandering
planets
in
the
sky
what
are
all
these
and
a
thousand
such
but
manifestations
of
an
orderly
and
unchanging
procession
of
events
the
faith
of
early
observers
in
this
interpretation
may
perhaps
have
been
shaken
by
the
occurrence
of
such
a
phenomenon
as
an
eclipse
a
sudden
and
mysterious
breach
of
the
ordinary
course
of
natural
events
but
it
would
be
resumed
in
tenfold
strength
as
soon
as
the
discovery
was
made
that
eclipses
themselves
recur
and
may
be
predicted
astronomical
predictions
of
all
kinds
depend
upon
the
admission
of
this
fact
that
there
never
has
been
and
never
will
be
any
intervention
in
the
operation
of
natural
laws
the
scientific
philosopher
affirms
that
the
condition
of
the
world
at
any
given
moment
is
the
direct
result
of
its
condition
in
the
preceding
moment
and
the
direct
cause
of
its
condition
in
the
subsequent
moment
law
and
chance
are
only
different
names
for
mechanical
necessity
about
fifty
years
after
the
death
of
copernicus
john
kepler
a
native
of
wurtemberg
who
had
adopted
the
heliocentric
theory
and
who
was
deeply
impressed
with
the
belief
that
relationships
exist
in
the
revolutions
of
the
planetary
bodies
round
the
sun
and
that
these
if
correctly
examined
would
reveal
the
laws
under
which
those
movements
take
place
devoted
himself
to
the
study
of
the
distances
times
and
velocities
of
the
planets
and
the
form
of
their
orbits
his
method
was
to
submit
the
observations
to
which
he
had
access
such
as
those
of
tycho
brahe
to
computations
based
first
on
one
and
then
on
another
hypothesis
rejecting
the
hypothesis
if
he
found
that
the
calculations
did
not
accord
with
the
observations
the
incredible
labor
he
had
undergone
he
says
i
considered
and
i
computed
until
i
almost
went
mad
was
at
length
rewarded
and
in
he
published
his
book
on
the
motions
of
the
planet
mars
in
this
he
had
attempted
to
reconcile
the
movements
of
that
planet
to
the
hypothesis
of
eccentrics
and
epicycles
but
eventually
discovered
that
the
orbit
of
a
planet
is
not
a
circle
but
an
ellipse
the
sun
being
in
one
of
the
foci
and
that
the
areas
swept
over
by
a
line
drawn
from
the
planet
to
the
sun
are
proportional
to
the
times
these
constitute
what
are
now
known
as
the
first
and
second
laws
of
kepler
eight
years
subsequently
he
was
rewarded
by
the
discovery
of
a
third
law
defining
the
relation
between
the
mean
distances
of
the
planets
from
the
sun
and
the
times
of
their
revolutions
the
squares
of
the
periodic
times
are
proportional
to
the
cubes
of
the
distances
in
an
epitome
of
the
copernican
system
published
in
he
announced
this
law
and
showed
that
it
holds
good
for
the
satellites
of
jupiter
as
regards
their
primary
hence
it
was
inferred
that
the
laws
which
preside
over
the
grand
movements
of
the
solar
system
preside
also
over
the
less
movements
of
its
constituent
parts
the
conception
of
law
which
is
unmistakably
conveyed
by
discoveries
and
the
evidence
they
gave
in
support
of
the
heliocentric
as
against
the
geocentric
theory
could
not
fail
to
incur
the
reprehension
of
the
roman
authorities
the
congregation
of
the
index
therefore
when
they
denounced
the
copernican
system
as
utterly
contrary
to
the
holy
scriptures
prohibited
kepler
epitome
of
that
system
it
was
on
this
occasion
that
kepler
submitted
his
celebrated
remonstrance
eighty
years
have
elapsed
during
which
the
doctrines
of
copernicus
regarding
the
movement
of
the
earth
and
the
immobility
of
the
sun
have
been
promulgated
without
hinderance
because
it
was
deemed
allowable
to
dispute
concerning
natural
things
and
to
elucidate
the
works
of
god
and
now
that
new
testimony
is
discovered
in
proof
of
the
truth
of
those
doctrines
testimony
which
was
not
known
to
the
spiritual
judges
ye
would
prohibit
the
promulgation
of
the
true
system
of
the
structure
of
the
universe
none
of
kepler
contemporaries
believed
the
law
of
the
areas
nor
was
it
accepted
until
the
publication
of
the
principia
of
newton
in
fact
no
one
in
those
times
understood
the
philosophical
meaning
of
laws
he
himself
did
not
foresee
what
they
must
inevitably
lead
to
his
mistakes
showed
how
far
he
was
from
perceiving
their
result
thus
he
thought
that
each
planet
is
the
seat
of
an
intelligent
principle
and
that
there
is
a
relation
between
the
magnitudes
of
the
orbits
of
the
five
principal
planets
and
the
five
regular
solids
of
geometry
at
first
he
inclined
to
believe
that
the
orbit
of
mars
is
oval
nor
was
it
until
after
a
wearisome
study
that
he
detected
the
grand
truth
its
elliptical
form
an
idea
of
the
incorruptibility
of
the
celestial
objects
had
led
to
the
adoption
of
the
aristotelian
doctrine
of
the
perfection
of
circular
motions
and
to
the
belief
that
there
were
none
but
circular
motions
in
the
heavens
he
bitterly
complains
of
this
as
having
been
a
fatal
thief
of
his
time
his
philosophical
daring
is
illustrated
in
his
breaking
through
this
tradition
in
some
most
important
particulars
kepler
anticipated
newton
he
was
the
first
to
give
clear
ideas
respecting
gravity
he
says
every
particle
of
matter
will
rest
until
it
is
disturbed
by
some
other
particle
that
the
earth
attracts
a
stone
more
than
the
stone
attracts
the
earth
and
that
bodies
move
to
each
other
in
proportion
to
their
masses
that
the
earth
would
ascend
to
the
moon
of
the
distance
and
the
moon
would
move
toward
the
earth
the
other
he
affirms
that
the
moon
attraction
causes
the
tides
and
that
the
planets
must
impress
irregularities
on
the
moon
motions
the
progress
of
astronomy
is
obviously
divisible
into
three
periods
the
period
of
observation
of
the
apparent
motions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
the
period
of
discovery
of
their
real
motions
and
particularly
of
the
laws
of
the
planetary
revolutions
this
was
signally
illustrated
by
copernicus
and
kepler
the
period
of
the
ascertainment
of
the
causes
of
those
laws
it
was
the
epoch
of
newton
the
passage
of
the
second
into
the
third
period
depended
on
the
development
of
the
dynamical
branch
of
mechanics
which
had
been
in
a
stagnant
condition
from
the
time
of
archimedes
or
the
alexandrian
school
in
christian
europe
there
had
not
been
a
cultivator
of
mechanical
philosophy
until
leonardo
da
vinci
who
was
born
to
him
and
not
to
lord
bacon
must
be
attributed
the
renaissance
of
science
bacon
was
not
only
ignorant
of
mathematics
but
depreciated
its
application
to
physical
inquiries
he
contemptuously
rejected
the
copernican
system
alleging
absurd
objections
to
it
while
galileo
was
on
the
brink
of
his
great
telescopic
discoveries
bacon
was
publishing
doubts
as
to
the
utility
of
instruments
in
scientific
investigations
to
ascribe
the
inductive
method
to
him
is
to
ignore
history
his
fanciful
philosophical
suggestions
have
never
been
of
the
slightest
practical
use
no
one
has
ever
thought
of
employing
them
except
among
english
readers
his
name
is
almost
unknown
to
da
vinci
i
shall
have
occasion
to
allude
more
particularly
on
a
subsequent
page
of
his
works
still
remaining
in
manuscript
two
volumes
are
at
milan
and
one
in
paris
carried
there
by
napoleon
after
an
interval
of
about
seventy
years
da
vinci
was
followed
by
the
dutch
engineer
stevinus
whose
work
on
the
principles
of
equilibrium
was
published
in
six
years
afterward
appeared
galileo
treatise
on
mechanics
to
this
great
italian
is
due
the
establishment
of
the
three
fundamental
laws
of
dynamics
known
as
the
laws
of
motion
the
consequences
of
the
establishment
of
these
laws
were
very
important
it
had
been
supposed
that
continuous
movements
such
for
instance
as
those
of
the
celestial
bodies
could
only
be
maintained
by
a
perpetual
consumption
and
perpetual
application
of
force
but
the
first
of
galileo
laws
declared
that
every
body
will
persevere
in
its
state
of
rest
or
of
uniform
motion
in
a
right
line
until
it
is
compelled
to
change
that
state
by
disturbing
forces
a
clear
perception
of
this
fundamental
principle
is
essential
to
a
comprehension
of
the
elementary
facts
of
physical
astronomy
since
all
the
motions
that
we
witness
taking
place
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
soon
come
to
an
end
we
are
led
to
infer
that
rest
is
the
natural
condition
of
things
we
have
made
then
a
very
great
advance
when
we
have
become
satisfied
that
a
body
is
equally
indifferent
to
rest
as
to
motion
and
that
it
equally
perseveres
in
either
state
until
disturbing
forces
are
applied
such
disturbing
forces
in
the
case
of
common
movements
are
friction
and
the
resistance
of
the
air
when
no
such
resistances
exist
movement
must
be
perpetual
as
is
the
case
with
the
heavenly
bodies
which
are
moving
in
a
void
forces
no
matter
what
their
difference
of
magnitude
may
be
will
exert
their
full
influence
conjointly
each
as
though
the
other
did
not
exist
thus
when
a
ball
is
suffered
to
drop
from
the
mouth
of
a
cannon
it
falls
to
the
ground
in
a
certain
interval
of
time
through
the
influence
of
gravity
upon
it
if
then
it
be
fired
from
the
cannon
though
now
it
may
be
projected
some
thousands
of
feet
in
a
second
the
effect
of
gravity
upon
it
will
be
precisely
the
same
as
before
in
the
intermingling
of
forces
there
is
no
deterioration
each
produces
its
own
specific
effect
in
the
latter
half
of
the
seventeenth
century
through
the
works
of
borelli
hooke
and
huyghens
it
had
become
plain
that
circular
motions
could
be
accounted
for
by
the
laws
of
galileo
borelli
treating
of
the
motions
of
jupiter
satellites
shows
how
a
circular
movement
may
arise
under
the
influence
of
a
central
force
hooke
exhibited
the
inflection
of
a
direct
motion
into
a
circular
by
a
supervening
central
attraction
the
year
presents
not
only
an
epoch
in
european
science
but
also
in
the
intellectual
development
of
man
it
is
marked
by
the
publication
of
the
principia
of
newton
an
incomparable
an
immortal
work
on
the
principle
that
all
bodies
attract
each
other
with
forces
directly
as
their
masses
and
inversely
as
the
squares
of
their
distances
newton
showed
that
all
the
movements
of
the
celestial
bodies
may
be
accounted
for
and
that
kepler
laws
might
all
have
been
predicted
the
elliptic
motions
the
described
areas
the
relation
of
the
times
and
distances
as
we
have
seen
newton
contemporaries
had
perceived
how
circular
motions
could
be
explained
that
was
a
special
case
but
newton
furnished
the
solution
of
the
general
problem
containing
all
special
cases
of
motion
in
circles
ellipses
parabolas
hyperbolas
that
is
in
all
the
conic
sections
the
alexandrian
mathematicians
had
shown
that
the
direction
of
movement
of
falling
bodies
is
toward
the
centre
of
the
earth
newton
proved
that
this
must
necessarily
be
the
case
the
general
effect
of
the
attraction
of
all
the
particles
of
a
sphere
being
the
same
as
if
they
were
all
concentrated
in
its
centre
to
this
central
force
thus
determining
the
fall
of
bodies
the
designation
of
gravity
was
given
up
to
this
time
no
one
except
kepler
had
considered
how
far
its
influence
reached
it
seemed
to
newton
possible
that
it
might
extend
as
far
as
the
moon
and
be
the
force
that
deflects
her
from
a
rectilinear
path
and
makes
her
revolve
in
her
orbit
round
the
earth
it
was
easy
to
compute
on
the
principle
of
the
law
of
inverse
squares
whether
the
earth
attraction
was
sufficient
to
produce
the
observed
effect
employing
the
measures
of
the
size
of
the
earth
accessible
at
the
time
newton
found
that
the
moon
deflection
was
only
thirteen
feet
in
a
minute
whereas
if
his
hypothesis
of
gravitation
were
true
it
should
be
fifteen
feet
but
in
picard
as
we
have
seen
executed
the
measurement
of
a
degree
more
carefully
than
had
previously
been
done
this
changed
the
estimate
of
the
magnitude
of
the
earth
and
therefore
of
the
distance
of
the
moon
and
newton
attention
having
been
directed
to
it
by
some
discussions
that
took
place
at
the
royal
society
in
he
obtained
results
went
home
took
out
his
old
papers
and
resumed
his
calculations
as
they
drew
to
a
close
he
became
so
much
agitated
that
he
was
obliged
to
desire
a
friend
to
finish
them
the
expected
coincidence
was
established
it
was
proved
that
the
moon
is
retained
in
her
orbit
and
made
to
revolve
round
the
earth
by
the
force
of
terrestrial
gravity
the
genii
of
kepler
had
given
place
to
the
vortices
of
descartes
and
these
in
their
turn
to
the
central
force
of
newton
in
like
manner
the
earth
and
each
of
the
planets
are
made
to
move
in
an
elliptic
orbit
round
the
sun
by
his
attractive
force
and
perturbations
arise
by
reason
of
the
disturbing
action
of
the
planetary
masses
on
one
another
knowing
the
masses
and
the
distances
these
disturbances
may
be
computed
later
astronomers
have
even
succeeded
with
the
inverse
problem
that
is
knowing
the
perturbations
or
disturbances
to
find
the
place
and
the
mass
of
the
disturbing
body
thus
from
the
deviations
of
uranus
from
his
theoretical
position
the
discovery
of
neptune
was
accomplished
newton
merit
consisted
in
this
that
he
applied
the
laws
of
dynamics
to
the
movements
of
the
celestial
bodies
and
insisted
that
scientific
theories
must
be
substantiated
by
the
agreement
of
observations
with
calculations
when
kepler
announced
his
three
laws
they
were
received
with
condemnation
by
the
spiritual
authorities
not
because
of
any
error
they
were
supposed
to
present
or
to
contain
but
partly
because
they
gave
support
to
the
copernican
system
and
partly
because
it
was
judged
inexpedient
to
admit
the
prevalence
of
law
of
any
kind
as
opposed
to
providential
intervention
the
world
was
regarded
as
the
theatre
in
which
the
divine
will
was
daily
displayed
it
was
considered
derogatory
to
the
majesty
of
god
that
that
will
should
be
fettered
in
any
way
the
power
of
the
clergy
was
chiefly
manifested
in
the
influence
the
were
alleged
to
possess
in
changing
his
arbitrary
determinations
it
was
thus
that
they
could
abate
the
baleful
action
of
comets
secure
fine
weather
or
rain
prevent
eclipses
and
arresting
the
course
of
nature
work
all
manner
of
miracles
it
was
thus
that
the
shadow
had
been
made
to
go
back
on
the
dial
and
the
sun
and
the
moon
stopped
in
in
the
century
preceding
the
epoch
of
newton
a
great
religious
and
political
revolution
had
taken
place
the
reformation
though
its
effect
had
not
been
the
securing
of
complete
liberty
for
thought
it
had
weakened
many
of
the
old
ecclesiastical
bonds
in
the
reformed
countries
there
was
no
power
to
express
a
condemnation
of
newton
works
and
among
the
clergy
there
was
no
disposition
to
give
themselves
any
concern
about
the
matter
at
first
the
attention
of
the
protestant
was
engrossed
by
the
movements
of
his
great
enemy
the
catholic
and
when
that
source
of
disquietude
ceased
and
the
inevitable
partitions
of
the
reformation
arose
that
attention
was
fastened
upon
the
rival
and
antagonistic
churches
the
lutheran
the
calvinist
the
episcopalian
the
presbyterian
had
something
more
urgent
on
hand
than
mathematical
demonstrations
so
uncondemned
and
indeed
unobserved
in
this
clamor
of
fighting
sects
newton
grand
theory
solidly
established
itself
its
philosophical
significance
was
infinitely
more
momentous
than
the
dogmas
that
these
persons
were
quarreling
about
it
not
only
accepted
the
heliocentric
theory
and
the
laws
discovered
by
kepler
but
it
proved
that
no
matter
what
might
be
the
weight
of
opposing
ecclesiastical
authority
the
sun
must
be
the
centre
of
our
system
and
that
laws
are
the
result
of
a
mathematical
necessity
it
is
impossible
that
they
should
be
other
than
they
are
but
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
plainly
that
the
solar
system
is
not
interrupted
by
providential
interventions
but
is
under
the
government
of
irreversible
law
law
that
is
itself
the
issue
of
mathematical
necessity
the
telescopic
observations
of
herschel
satisfied
him
that
there
are
very
many
double
stars
double
not
merely
because
they
are
accidentally
in
the
same
line
of
view
but
because
they
are
connected
physically
revolving
round
each
other
these
observations
were
continued
and
greatly
extended
by
herschel
ii
the
elements
of
the
elliptic
orbit
of
the
double
star
zeta
of
the
great
bear
were
determined
by
savary
its
period
being
and
years
those
of
another
sigma
coronae
were
determined
by
hind
its
period
being
more
than
seven
hundred
and
years
the
orbital
movement
of
these
double
suns
in
ellipses
compels
us
to
admit
that
the
law
of
gravitation
holds
good
far
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
solar
system
indeed
as
far
as
the
telescope
can
reach
it
demonstrates
the
reign
of
law
in
the
introduction
to
the
encyclopaedia
says
the
universe
is
but
a
single
fact
it
is
only
one
great
truth
shall
we
then
conclude
that
the
solar
and
the
starry
systems
have
been
called
into
existence
by
god
and
that
he
has
then
imposed
upon
them
by
his
arbitrary
will
laws
under
the
control
of
which
it
was
his
pleasure
that
their
movements
should
be
made
or
are
there
reasons
for
believing
that
these
several
systems
came
into
existence
not
by
such
an
arbitrary
fiat
but
through
the
operation
of
law
the
following
are
some
peculiarities
displayed
by
the
solar
system
as
enumerated
by
laplace
all
the
planets
and
their
satellites
move
in
ellipses
of
such
small
eccentricity
that
they
are
nearly
circles
all
the
planets
move
in
the
same
direction
and
nearly
in
the
same
plane
the
movements
of
the
satellites
are
in
the
same
direction
as
those
of
the
planets
the
movements
of
rotation
of
the
sun
of
the
planets
and
the
satellites
are
in
the
same
direction
as
their
orbital
motions
and
in
planes
little
different
it
is
impossible
that
so
many
coincidences
could
be
the
result
of
chance
is
it
not
plain
that
there
must
have
been
a
common
tie
among
all
these
bodies
that
they
are
only
parts
of
what
must
once
have
been
a
single
mass
but
if
we
admit
that
the
substance
of
which
the
solar
system
consists
once
existed
in
a
nebulous
condition
and
was
in
rotation
all
the
above
peculiarities
follow
as
necessary
mechanical
consequences
nay
more
the
formation
of
planets
the
formation
of
satellites
and
of
asteroids
is
accounted
for
we
see
why
the
outer
planets
and
satellites
are
larger
than
the
interior
ones
why
the
larger
planets
rotate
rapidly
and
the
small
ones
slowly
why
of
the
satellites
the
outer
planets
have
more
the
inner
fewer
we
are
furnished
with
indications
of
the
time
of
revolution
of
the
planets
in
their
orbits
and
of
the
satellites
in
theirs
we
perceive
the
mode
of
formation
of
saturn
rings
we
find
an
explanation
of
the
physical
condition
of
the
sun
and
the
transitions
of
condition
through
which
the
earth
and
moon
have
passed
as
indicated
by
their
geology
but
two
exceptions
to
the
above
peculiarities
have
been
noted
they
are
in
the
cases
of
uranus
and
neptune
the
existence
of
such
a
nebulous
mass
once
admitted
all
the
rest
follows
as
a
matter
of
necessity
is
there
not
however
a
most
serious
objection
in
the
way
is
not
this
to
exclude
almighty
god
from
the
worlds
he
has
made
first
we
must
be
satisfied
whether
there
is
any
solid
evidence
for
admitting
the
existence
of
such
a
nebulous
mass
the
nebular
hypothesis
rests
primarily
on
the
telescopic
discovery
made
by
herschel
that
there
are
scattered
here
and
there
in
the
heavens
pale
gleaming
patches
of
light
a
few
of
which
are
large
enough
to
be
visible
to
the
naked
eye
of
these
many
may
be
resolved
by
a
sufficient
telescopic
power
into
a
congeries
of
stars
but
some
such
as
the
great
nebula
in
orion
have
resisted
the
best
instruments
hitherto
made
it
was
asserted
by
those
who
were
indisposed
to
accept
the
nebular
hypothesis
that
the
was
due
to
imperfection
in
the
telescopes
used
in
these
instruments
two
distinct
functions
may
be
observed
their
power
depends
on
the
diameter
of
their
object
mirror
or
lens
their
defining
power
depends
on
the
exquisite
correctness
of
their
optical
surfaces
grand
instruments
may
possess
the
former
quality
in
perfection
by
reason
of
their
size
but
the
latter
very
imperfectly
either
through
want
of
original
configuration
or
distortion
arising
from
flexure
through
their
own
weight
but
unless
an
instrument
be
perfect
in
this
respect
as
well
as
adequate
in
the
other
it
may
fail
to
decompose
a
nebula
into
discrete
points
fortunately
however
other
means
for
the
settlement
of
this
question
are
available
in
it
was
discovered
by
the
author
of
this
book
that
the
spectrum
of
an
ignited
solid
is
continuous
that
is
has
neither
dark
nor
bright
lines
fraunhofer
had
previously
made
known
that
the
spectrum
of
ignited
gases
is
discontinuous
here
then
is
the
means
of
determining
whether
the
light
emitted
by
a
given
nebula
comes
from
an
incandescent
gas
or
from
a
congeries
of
ignited
solids
stars
or
suns
if
its
spectrum
be
discontinuous
it
is
a
true
nebula
or
gas
if
continuous
a
congeries
of
stars
in
huggins
made
this
examination
in
the
case
of
a
nebula
in
the
constellation
draco
it
proved
to
be
gaseous
subsequent
observations
have
shown
that
of
sixty
nebulae
examined
nineteen
give
discontinuous
or
gaseous
spectra
the
remainder
continuous
ones
it
may
therefore
be
admitted
that
physical
evidence
has
at
length
been
obtained
demonstrating
the
existence
of
vast
masses
of
matter
in
a
gaseous
condition
and
at
a
temperature
of
incandescence
the
hypothesis
of
laplace
has
thus
a
firm
basis
in
such
a
nebular
mass
cooling
by
radiation
is
a
necessary
incident
and
condensation
and
rotation
the
inevitable
results
there
must
be
a
separation
of
rings
all
lying
in
one
plane
a
generation
of
planets
and
satellites
all
rotating
alike
a
central
sun
and
engirdling
globes
from
a
chaotic
mass
through
the
operation
of
natural
laws
an
organized
system
has
been
produced
an
integration
of
matter
into
worlds
has
taken
place
through
a
decline
of
heat
if
such
be
the
cosmogony
of
the
solar
system
such
the
genesis
of
the
planetary
worlds
we
are
constrained
to
extend
our
views
of
the
dominion
of
law
and
to
recognize
its
agency
in
the
creation
as
well
as
in
the
conservation
of
the
innumerable
orbs
that
throng
the
universe
but
again
it
may
be
asked
is
there
not
something
profoundly
impious
in
this
are
we
not
excluding
almighty
god
from
the
world
he
has
made
we
have
often
witnessed
the
formation
of
a
cloud
in
a
serene
sky
a
hazy
point
barely
perceptible
a
little
wreath
of
mist
increases
in
volume
and
becomes
darker
and
denser
until
it
obscures
a
large
portion
of
the
heavens
it
throws
itself
into
fantastic
shapes
it
gathers
a
glory
from
the
sun
is
borne
onward
by
the
wind
and
perhaps
as
it
gradually
came
so
it
gradually
disappears
melting
away
in
the
untroubled
air
now
we
say
that
the
little
vesicles
of
which
this
cloud
was
composed
arose
from
the
condensation
of
preexisting
in
the
atmosphere
through
reduction
of
temperature
we
show
how
they
assumed
the
form
they
present
we
assign
optical
reasons
for
the
brightness
or
blackness
of
the
cloud
we
explain
on
mechanical
principles
its
drifting
before
the
wind
for
its
disappearance
we
account
on
the
principles
of
chemistry
it
never
occurs
to
us
to
invoke
the
interposition
of
the
almighty
in
the
production
and
fashioning
of
this
fugitive
form
we
explain
all
the
facts
connected
with
it
by
physical
laws
and
perhaps
should
reverentially
hesitate
to
call
into
operation
the
finger
of
god
but
the
universe
is
nothing
more
than
such
a
cloud
a
cloud
of
suns
and
worlds
supremely
grand
though
it
may
seem
to
us
to
the
infinite
and
eternal
intellect
it
is
no
more
than
a
fleeting
mist
if
there
be
a
multiplicity
of
worlds
in
infinite
space
there
is
also
a
succession
of
worlds
in
infinite
time
as
one
after
another
cloud
replaces
cloud
in
the
skies
so
this
starry
system
the
universe
is
the
successor
of
countless
others
that
have
preceded
it
the
predecessor
of
countless
others
that
will
follow
there
is
an
unceasing
metamorphosis
a
sequence
of
events
without
beginning
or
end
if
on
physical
principles
we
account
for
minor
meteorological
incidents
mists
and
clouds
is
it
not
permissible
for
us
to
appeal
to
the
same
principle
in
the
origin
of
and
universes
which
are
only
clouds
on
a
somewhat
larger
mists
on
a
somewhat
less
transient
can
any
man
place
the
line
which
bounds
the
physical
on
one
side
the
supernatural
on
the
other
do
not
our
estimates
of
the
extent
and
the
duration
of
things
depend
altogether
on
our
point
of
view
were
we
set
in
the
midst
of
the
great
nebula
of
orion
how
transcendently
magnificent
the
scene
the
vast
transformations
the
condensations
of
a
fiery
mist
into
worlds
might
seem
worthy
of
the
immediate
presence
the
supervision
of
god
here
at
our
distant
station
where
millions
of
miles
are
inappreciable
to
our
eyes
and
suns
seem
no
bigger
than
motes
in
the
air
that
nebula
is
more
insignificant
than
the
faintest
cloud
galileo
in
his
description
of
the
constellation
of
orion
did
not
think
it
worth
while
so
much
as
to
mention
it
the
most
rigorous
theologian
of
those
days
would
have
seen
nothing
to
blame
in
imputing
its
origin
to
secondary
causes
nothing
irreligious
in
failing
to
invoke
the
arbitrary
interference
of
god
in
its
metamorphoses
if
such
be
the
conclusion
to
which
we
come
respecting
it
what
would
be
the
conclusion
to
which
an
intelligence
seated
in
it
might
come
respecting
us
it
occupies
an
extent
of
space
millions
of
times
greater
than
that
of
our
solar
system
we
are
invisible
from
it
and
therefore
absolutely
insignificant
would
such
an
intelligence
think
it
necessary
to
require
for
our
origin
and
maintenance
the
immediate
intervention
of
god
from
the
solar
system
let
us
descend
to
what
is
still
more
insignificant
a
little
portion
of
it
let
us
descend
to
our
own
earth
in
the
lapse
of
time
it
has
experienced
great
changes
have
these
been
due
to
incessant
divine
interventions
or
to
the
continuous
operation
of
unfailing
law
the
aspect
of
nature
perpetually
varies
under
our
eyes
still
more
grandly
and
strikingly
has
it
altered
in
geological
times
but
the
laws
guiding
those
changes
never
exhibit
the
slightest
variation
in
the
midst
of
immense
vicissitudes
they
are
immutable
the
present
order
of
things
is
only
a
link
in
a
vast
connected
chain
reaching
back
to
an
incalculable
past
and
forward
to
an
infinite
future
there
is
evidence
geological
and
astronomical
that
the
temperature
of
the
earth
and
her
satellite
was
in
the
remote
past
very
much
higher
than
it
is
now
a
decline
so
slow
as
to
be
imperceptible
at
short
intervals
but
manifest
enough
in
the
course
of
many
ages
has
occurred
the
heat
has
been
lost
by
radiation
into
space
the
cooling
of
a
mass
of
any
kind
no
matter
whether
large
or
small
is
not
discontinuous
it
does
not
go
on
by
fits
and
starts
it
takes
place
under
the
operation
of
a
mathematical
law
though
for
such
mighty
changes
as
are
here
contemplated
neither
the
formula
of
newton
nor
that
of
dulong
and
petit
may
apply
it
signifies
nothing
that
periods
of
partial
decline
glacial
periods
or
others
of
temporary
elevation
have
been
intercalated
it
signifies
nothing
whether
these
variations
may
have
arisen
from
topographical
variations
as
those
of
level
or
from
periodicities
in
the
radiation
of
the
sun
a
periodical
sun
would
act
as
a
mere
perturbation
in
the
gradual
decline
of
heat
the
perturbations
of
the
planetary
motions
are
a
confirmation
not
a
disproof
of
gravity
now
such
a
decline
of
temperature
must
have
been
attended
by
innumerable
changes
of
a
physical
character
in
our
globe
her
dimensions
must
have
diminished
through
contraction
the
length
of
her
day
must
have
lessened
her
surface
must
have
collapsed
and
fractures
taken
place
along
the
lines
of
least
resistance
the
density
of
the
sea
must
have
increased
its
volume
must
have
become
less
the
constitution
of
the
atmosphere
must
have
varied
especially
in
the
amount
of
and
carbonic
acid
that
it
contained
the
barometric
pressure
must
have
declined
these
changes
and
very
many
more
that
might
be
mentioned
must
have
taken
place
not
in
a
discontinuous
but
in
an
orderly
manner
since
the
the
decline
of
heat
that
was
causing
them
was
itself
following
a
mathematical
law
but
not
alone
did
lifeless
nature
submit
to
these
inevitable
mutations
living
nature
was
also
simultaneously
affected
an
organic
form
of
any
kind
vegetable
or
animal
will
remain
unchanged
only
so
long
as
the
environment
in
which
it
is
placed
remains
unchanged
should
an
alteration
in
the
environment
occur
the
organism
will
either
be
modified
or
destroyed
destruction
is
more
likely
to
happen
as
the
change
in
the
environment
is
more
sudden
modification
or
transformation
is
more
possible
as
that
change
is
more
gradual
since
it
is
demonstrably
certain
that
lifeless
nature
has
in
the
lapse
of
ages
undergone
vast
modifications
since
the
crust
of
the
earth
and
the
sea
and
the
atmosphere
are
no
longer
such
as
they
once
were
since
the
distribution
of
the
land
and
the
ocean
and
all
manner
of
physical
conditions
have
varied
since
there
have
been
such
grand
changes
in
the
environment
of
living
things
on
the
surface
of
our
planet
it
necessarily
follows
that
organic
nature
must
have
passed
through
destructions
and
transformations
in
correspondence
thereto
that
such
extinctions
such
modifications
have
taken
place
how
copious
how
convincing
is
the
evidence
here
again
we
must
observe
that
since
the
disturbing
agency
was
itself
following
a
mathematical
law
these
its
results
must
be
considered
as
following
that
law
too
such
considerations
then
plainly
force
upon
us
the
conclusion
that
the
organic
progress
of
the
world
has
been
guided
by
the
operation
of
immutable
law
not
determined
by
discontinuous
disconnected
arbitrary
interventions
of
god
they
incline
us
to
view
favorably
the
idea
of
transmutations
of
one
form
into
another
rather
than
that
of
sudden
creations
creation
implies
an
abrupt
appearance
transformation
a
gradual
change
in
this
manner
is
presented
to
our
contemplation
the
great
theory
of
evolution
every
organic
being
has
a
place
in
a
chain
of
events
it
is
not
an
isolated
a
capricious
fact
but
an
unavoidable
phenomenon
it
has
its
place
in
that
vast
orderly
concourse
which
has
successively
risen
in
the
past
has
introduced
the
present
and
is
preparing
the
way
for
a
predestined
future
from
point
to
point
in
this
vast
progression
there
has
been
a
gradual
a
definite
a
continuous
unfolding
a
resistless
order
of
evolution
but
in
the
midst
of
these
mighty
changes
stand
forth
immutable
the
laws
that
are
dominating
over
all
if
we
examine
the
introduction
of
any
type
of
life
in
the
animal
series
we
find
that
it
is
in
accordance
with
transformation
not
with
creation
its
beginning
is
under
an
imperfect
form
in
the
midst
of
other
forms
of
which
the
time
is
nearly
complete
and
which
are
passing
into
extinction
by
degrees
one
species
after
another
in
succession
more
and
more
perfect
arises
until
after
many
ages
a
culmination
is
reached
from
that
there
is
in
like
manner
a
long
a
gradual
decline
thus
though
the
mammal
type
of
life
is
the
characteristic
of
the
tertiary
and
periods
it
does
not
suddenly
make
its
appearance
without
premonition
in
those
periods
far
back
in
the
secondary
we
find
it
under
imperfect
forms
struggling
as
it
were
to
make
good
a
foothold
at
length
it
gains
a
predominance
under
higher
and
better
models
so
too
of
reptiles
the
characteristic
type
of
life
of
the
secondary
period
as
we
see
in
a
dissolving
view
out
of
the
fading
outlines
of
a
scene
that
is
passing
away
the
dim
form
of
a
new
one
emerging
which
gradually
gains
strength
reaches
its
culmination
and
then
melts
away
in
some
other
that
is
displacing
it
so
doubtfully
appears
reaches
its
culmination
and
gradually
declines
in
all
this
there
is
nothing
abrupt
the
changes
shade
into
each
other
by
insensible
degrees
how
could
it
be
otherwise
the
animals
could
not
exist
in
an
atmosphere
so
laden
with
carbonic
acid
as
was
that
of
the
primitive
times
but
the
removal
of
that
noxious
ingredient
from
the
air
by
the
leaves
of
plants
under
the
influence
of
sunlight
the
enveloping
of
its
carbon
in
the
earth
under
the
form
of
coal
the
disengagement
of
its
oxygen
permitted
their
life
as
the
atmosphere
was
thus
modified
the
sea
was
involved
in
the
change
it
surrendered
a
large
part
of
its
carbonic
acid
and
the
limestone
hitherto
held
in
solution
by
it
was
deposited
in
the
solid
form
for
every
equivalent
of
carbon
buried
in
the
earth
there
was
an
equivalent
of
carbonate
of
lime
separated
from
the
sea
not
necessarily
in
an
amorphous
condition
most
frequently
under
an
organic
form
the
sunshine
kept
up
its
work
day
by
day
but
there
were
demanded
myriads
of
days
for
the
work
to
be
completed
it
was
a
slow
passage
from
a
noxious
to
a
purified
atmosphere
and
an
equally
slow
passage
from
a
to
a
type
of
life
but
the
physical
changes
were
taking
place
under
the
control
of
law
and
the
organic
transformations
were
not
sudden
or
arbitrary
providential
acts
they
were
the
immediate
the
inevitable
consequences
of
the
physical
changes
and
therefore
like
them
the
necessary
issue
of
law
for
a
more
detailed
consideration
of
this
subject
i
may
refer
the
reader
to
chapters
i
vii
of
the
second
book
of
my
treatise
on
human
physiology
published
in
is
the
world
then
governed
by
law
or
by
providential
interventions
abruptly
breaking
the
proper
sequence
of
events
to
complete
our
view
of
this
question
we
turn
finally
to
what
in
one
sense
is
the
most
insignificant
in
another
the
most
important
case
that
can
be
considered
do
human
societies
in
their
historic
career
exhibit
the
marks
of
a
predetermined
progress
in
an
unavoidable
track
is
there
any
evidence
that
the
life
of
nations
is
under
the
control
of
immutable
law
may
we
conclude
that
in
society
as
in
the
individual
man
parts
never
spring
from
nothing
but
are
evolved
or
developed
from
parts
that
are
already
in
existence
if
any
one
should
object
to
or
deride
the
doctrine
of
the
evolution
or
successive
development
of
the
animated
forms
which
constitute
that
unbroken
organic
chain
reaching
from
the
beginning
of
life
on
the
globe
to
the
present
times
let
him
reflect
that
he
has
himself
passed
through
modifications
the
counterpart
of
those
he
disputes
for
nine
months
his
type
of
life
was
aquatic
and
during
that
time
he
assumed
in
succession
many
distinct
but
correlated
forms
at
birth
his
type
of
life
became
aerial
he
began
respiring
the
atmospheric
air
new
elements
of
food
were
supplied
to
him
the
mode
of
his
nutrition
changed
but
as
yet
he
could
see
nothing
hear
nothing
notice
nothing
by
degrees
conscious
existence
was
assumed
he
became
aware
that
there
is
an
external
world
in
due
time
organs
adapted
to
another
change
of
food
the
teeth
appeared
and
a
change
of
food
ensued
he
then
passed
through
the
stages
of
childhood
and
youth
his
bodily
form
developing
and
with
it
his
intellectual
powers
at
about
fifteen
years
in
consequence
of
the
evolution
which
special
parts
of
his
system
had
attained
his
moral
character
changed
new
ideas
new
passions
influenced
him
and
that
that
was
the
cause
and
this
the
effect
is
demonstrated
when
by
the
skill
of
the
surgeon
those
parts
have
been
interfered
with
nor
does
the
development
the
metamorphosis
end
here
it
requires
many
years
for
the
body
to
reach
its
full
perfection
many
years
for
the
mind
a
culmination
is
at
length
reached
and
then
there
is
a
decline
i
need
not
picture
its
mournful
incidents
the
corporeal
the
intellectual
enfeeblement
perhaps
there
is
little
exaggeration
in
saying
that
in
less
than
a
century
every
human
being
on
the
face
of
the
globe
if
not
cut
off
in
an
untimely
manner
has
passed
through
all
these
changes
is
there
for
each
of
us
a
providential
intervention
as
we
thus
pass
from
stage
to
stage
of
life
or
shall
we
not
rather
believe
that
the
countless
myriads
of
human
beings
who
have
peopled
the
earth
have
been
under
the
guidance
of
an
unchanging
a
universal
law
but
individuals
are
the
elementary
constituents
of
communities
nations
they
maintain
therein
a
relation
like
that
which
the
particles
of
the
body
maintain
to
the
body
itself
these
introduced
into
it
commence
and
complete
their
function
they
die
and
are
dismissed
like
the
individual
the
nation
comes
into
existence
without
its
own
knowledge
and
dies
without
its
own
consent
often
against
its
own
will
national
life
differs
in
no
particular
from
individual
except
in
this
that
it
is
spread
over
a
longer
span
but
no
nation
can
escape
its
inevitable
term
each
if
its
history
be
well
considered
shows
its
time
of
infancy
its
time
of
youth
its
time
of
maturity
its
time
of
decline
if
its
phases
of
life
be
completed
in
the
phases
of
existence
of
all
so
far
as
those
phases
are
completed
there
are
common
characteristics
and
as
like
accordances
in
individuals
point
out
that
all
are
living
under
a
reign
of
law
we
are
justified
in
inferring
that
the
course
of
nations
and
indeed
the
progress
of
humanity
does
not
take
place
in
a
chance
or
random
way
that
supernatural
interventions
never
break
the
chain
of
historic
acts
that
every
historic
event
has
its
warrant
in
some
preceding
event
and
gives
warrant
to
others
that
are
to
but
this
conclusion
is
the
essential
principle
of
stoicism
that
grecian
philosophical
system
which
as
i
have
already
said
offered
a
support
in
their
hour
of
trial
and
an
unwavering
guide
in
the
vicissitudes
of
life
not
only
to
many
illustrious
greeks
but
also
to
some
of
the
great
philosophers
statesmen
generals
and
emperors
of
rome
a
system
which
excluded
chance
from
every
thing
and
asserted
the
direction
of
all
events
by
irresistible
necessity
to
the
promotion
of
perfect
good
a
system
of
earnestness
sternness
austerity
virtue
a
protest
in
favor
of
the
of
mankind
and
perhaps
we
shall
not
dissent
from
the
remark
of
montesquieu
who
affirms
that
the
destruction
of
the
stoics
was
a
great
calamity
to
the
human
race
for
they
alone
made
great
citizens
great
men
to
the
principle
of
government
by
law
latin
christianity
in
its
papal
form
is
in
absolute
contradiction
the
history
of
this
branch
of
the
christian
church
is
almost
a
diary
of
miracles
and
supernatural
interventions
these
show
that
the
supplications
of
holy
men
have
often
arrested
the
course
of
nature
if
indeed
there
be
any
such
course
that
images
and
pictures
have
worked
wonders
that
bones
hairs
and
other
sacred
relics
have
wrought
miracles
the
criterion
or
proof
of
the
authenticity
of
many
of
these
objects
is
not
an
unchallengeable
record
of
their
origin
and
history
but
an
exhibition
of
their
powers
is
not
that
a
strange
logic
which
finds
proof
of
an
asserted
fact
in
an
inexplicable
illustration
of
something
else
even
in
the
darkest
ages
intelligent
christian
men
must
have
had
misgivings
as
to
these
alleged
providential
or
miraculous
interventions
there
is
a
solemn
grandeur
in
the
orderly
progress
of
nature
which
profoundly
impresses
us
and
such
is
the
character
of
continuity
in
the
events
of
our
individual
life
that
we
instinctively
doubt
the
occurrence
of
the
supernatural
in
that
of
our
neighbor
the
intelligent
man
knows
well
that
for
his
personal
behoof
the
course
of
nature
has
never
been
checked
for
him
no
miracle
has
ever
been
worked
he
attributes
justly
every
event
of
his
life
to
some
antecedent
event
this
he
looks
upon
as
the
cause
that
as
the
consequence
when
it
is
affirmed
that
in
his
neighbor
behalf
such
grand
interventions
have
been
vouchsafed
he
can
not
do
otherwise
than
believe
that
his
neighbor
is
either
deceived
or
practising
deception
as
might
then
have
been
anticipated
the
catholic
doctrine
of
miraculous
intervention
received
a
rude
shock
at
the
time
of
the
reformation
when
predestination
and
election
were
upheld
by
some
of
the
greatest
theologians
and
accepted
by
some
of
the
greatest
protestant
churches
with
stoical
austerity
calvin
declares
we
were
elected
from
eternity
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
from
no
merit
of
our
own
but
according
to
the
purpose
of
the
divine
pleasure
in
affirming
this
calvin
was
resting
on
the
belief
that
god
has
from
all
eternity
decreed
whatever
comes
to
pass
thus
after
the
lapse
of
many
ages
were
again
emerging
into
prominence
the
ideas
of
the
basilidians
wad
valentinians
christian
sects
of
the
second
century
whose
gnostical
views
led
to
the
engraftment
of
the
great
doctrine
of
the
trinity
upon
christianity
they
asserted
that
all
the
actions
of
men
are
necessary
that
even
faith
is
a
natural
gift
to
which
men
are
forcibly
determined
and
must
therefore
be
saved
though
their
lives
be
ever
so
irregular
from
the
supreme
god
all
things
proceeded
thus
also
came
into
prominence
the
views
which
were
developed
by
augustine
in
his
work
de
dono
perseverantiae
these
were
that
god
by
his
arbitrary
will
has
selected
certain
persons
without
respect
to
foreseen
faith
or
good
works
and
has
infallibly
ordained
to
bestow
upon
them
eternal
happiness
other
persons
in
like
manner
he
has
condemned
to
eternal
reprobation
the
sublapsarians
believed
that
god
permitted
the
fall
of
adam
the
supralapsarians
that
he
predestinated
it
with
all
its
pernicious
consequences
from
all
eternity
and
that
our
first
parents
had
no
liberty
from
the
beginning
in
this
these
sectarians
disregarded
the
remark
of
augustine
nefas
est
dicere
deum
aliquid
nisi
bonum
predestinare
is
it
true
then
that
predestination
to
eternal
happiness
is
the
everlasting
purpose
of
god
whereby
before
the
foundations
of
the
world
were
laid
he
hath
constantly
decreed
by
his
council
secret
to
us
to
deliver
from
curse
and
damnation
those
whom
he
hath
chosen
out
of
mankind
is
it
true
that
of
the
human
family
there
are
some
who
in
view
of
no
fault
of
their
own
almighty
god
has
condemned
to
unending
torture
eternal
misery
in
the
lambeth
articles
asserted
that
god
from
eternity
hath
predestinated
certain
men
unto
life
certain
he
hath
reprobated
in
the
synod
of
dort
decided
in
favor
of
this
view
it
condemned
the
remonstrants
against
it
and
treated
them
with
such
severity
that
many
of
them
had
to
flee
to
foreign
countries
even
in
the
church
of
england
as
is
manifested
by
its
seventeenth
article
of
faith
these
doctrines
have
found
favor
probably
there
was
no
point
which
brought
down
from
the
catholics
on
the
protestants
severer
condemnation
than
this
their
partial
acceptance
of
the
government
of
the
world
by
law
in
all
reformed
europe
miracles
ceased
but
with
the
cessation
of
great
pecuniary
profits
ended
indeed
as
is
well
known
it
was
the
sale
of
indulgences
that
provoked
the
reformation
indulgences
which
are
essentially
a
permit
from
god
for
the
practice
of
sin
conditioned
on
the
payment
of
a
certain
sum
of
money
to
the
priest
philosophically
the
reformation
implied
a
protest
against
the
catholic
doctrine
of
incessant
divine
intervention
in
human
affairs
invoked
by
sacerdotal
agency
but
this
protest
was
far
from
being
fully
made
by
all
the
reforming
churches
the
evidence
in
behalf
of
government
by
law
which
has
of
late
years
been
offered
by
science
is
received
by
many
of
them
with
suspicion
perhaps
with
dislike
sentiments
which
however
must
eventually
give
way
before
the
weight
of
evidence
shall
we
not
then
conclude
with
cicero

by
lactantius

than
a

latin

that

by

at

by
the

the

from

we
have
now
to
examine
how
it
discharged
its
trust
it
will
be
convenient
to
limit
to
the
case
of
europe
what
has
here
to
be
presented
though
from
the
claim
of
the
papacy
to
superhuman
origin
and
its
demand
for
universal
obedience
it
should
strictly
be
held
to
account
for
the
condition
of
all
mankind
its
inefficacy
against
the
great
and
venerable
religions
of
southern
and
eastern
asia
would
furnish
an
important
and
instructive
theme
for
consideration
and
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
it
has
impressed
itself
only
where
roman
imperial
influences
have
prevailed
a
political
conclusion
which
however
it
contemptuously
rejects
doubtless
at
the
inception
of
the
reformation
there
were
many
persons
who
compared
the
existing
social
condition
with
what
it
had
been
in
ancient
times
morals
had
not
changed
intelligence
had
not
advanced
society
had
little
improved
from
the
eternal
city
itself
its
splendors
had
vanished
the
marble
streets
of
which
augustus
had
once
boasted
had
disappeared
temples
broken
columns
and
the
long
arcaded
vistas
of
gigantic
aqueducts
bestriding
the
desolate
campagna
presented
a
mournful
scene
from
the
uses
to
which
they
had
been
respectively
put
the
capitol
had
been
known
as
goats
hill
and
the
site
of
the
roman
forum
whence
laws
had
been
issued
to
the

as

the

of
the

was
hidden
by
mounds
of
earth
crested
with
flowering
shrubs
the
baths
of
caracalla
with
their
porticoes
gardens
reservoirs
had
long
ago
become
useless
through
the
destruction
of
their
supplying

the
ruins
of
that
grand
edifice
flowery
glades
and
thickets
of
odoriferous
trees
extended
in
labyrinths
upon
immense
platforms
and
dizzy
arches
suspended
in
the
air
of
the
coliseum
the
most
colossal
of
roman
ruins
only
about
remained
once
capable
of
accommodating
nearly
ninety
thousand
spectators
it
had
in
succession
been
turned
into
a
fortress
in
the
middle
ages
and
then
into
a
to
furnish
material
for
the
palaces
of
degenerate
roman
princes
some
of
the
popes
had
occupied
it
as
a
some
as
a
saltpetre
factory
some
had
planned
the
conversion
of
its
magnificent
arcades
into
shops
for
tradesmen
the
iron
clamps
which
bound
its
stones
together
had
been
stolen
the
walls
were
fissured
and
falling
even
in
our
own
times
botanical
works
have
been
composed
on
the
plants
which
have
made
this
noble
wreck
their
home
the
flora
of
the
coliseum
contains
four
hundred
and
twenty
species
among
the
ruins
of
classical
buildings
might
be
seen
broken
columns
cypresses
and
mouldy
frescoes
dropping
from
the
walls
even
the
vegetable
world
participated
in
the
melancholy
change
the
myrtle
which
once
flourished
on
the
aventine
had
nearly
become
extinct
the
laurel
which
once
gave
its
leaves
to
encircle
the
brows
of
emperors
had
been
replaced
by
ivy
the
companion
of
death
but
perhaps
it
may
be
said
the
popes
were
not
responsible
for
all
this
let
it
be
remembered
that
in
less
than
one
hundred
and
forty
years
the
city
had
been
successively
taken
by
alaric
genseric
rieimer
vitiges
totila
that
many
of
its
great
edifices
had
been
converted
into
defensive
works
the
aqueducts
were
destroyed
by
vitiges
who
ruined
the
campagna
the
palace
of
the
caesars
was
ravaged
by
totila
then
there
had
been
the
lombard
sieges
then
robert
guiscard
and
his
normans
had
burnt
the
city
from
the
antonine
column
to
the
flaminian
gate
from
the
lateran
to
the
capitol
then
it
was
sacked
and
mutilated
by
the
constable
bourbon
again
and
again
it
was
flooded
by
inundations
of
the
tiber
and
shattered
by
earthquakes
we
must
however
bear
in
mind
the
accusation
of
machiavelli
who
says
in
his
history
of
florence
that
nearly
all
the
barbarian
invasions
of
italy
were
by
the
invitations
of
the
pontiffs
who
called
in
those
hordes
it
was
not
the
goth
nor
the
vandal
nor
the
norman
nor
the
saracen
but
the
popes
and
their
nephews
who
produced
the
dilapidation
of
rome
had
been
fed
from
the
ruins
classical
buildings
had
become
for
the
palaces
of
italian
princes
and
churches
were
decorated
from
the
old
temples
churches
decorated
from

it
is
for
this
and
such
as
this
that
the
popes
must
be
held
responsible

demoralization
of
the
people

on
papal
rome
manifested
no
consideration
but
rather
hatred
for
classical
rome
the
pontiffs
had
been
subordinates
of
the
byzantine
sovereigns
then
lieutenants
of
the
frankish
kings
then
arbiters
of
europe
their
government
had
changed
as
much
as
those
of
any
of
the
surrounding
nations
there
had
been
complete
metamorphoses
in
its
maxims
objects
claims
in
one
point
only
it
had
never
changed
intolerance
claiming
to
be
the
centre
of
the
religious
life
of
europe
it
steadfastly
refused
to
recognize
any
religious
existence
outside
of
itself
yet
both
in
a
political
and
theological
sense
it
was
rotten
to
the
core
erasmus
and
luther
heard
with
amazement
the
blasphemies
and
witnessed
with
a
shudder
the
atheism
of
the
city
the
historian
ranke
to
whom
i
am
indebted
for
many
of
these
facts
has
depicted
in
a
very
graphic
manner
the
demoralization
of
the
great
metropolis
the
popes
were
for
the
most
part
at
their
election
aged
men
power
was
therefore
incessantly
passing
into
new
hands
every
election
was
a
revolution
in
prospects
and
expectations
in
a
community
where
all
might
rise
where
all
might
aspire
to
all
it
necessarily
followed
that
every
man
was
occupied
in
thrusting
some
other
into
the
background
though
the
population
of
the
city
at
the
inception
of
the
reformation
had
sunk
to
eighty
thousand
there
were
vast
crowds
of
placemen
and
still
greater
ones
of
aspirants
for
place
the
successful
occupant
of
the
pontificate
had
thousands
of
offices
to
give
away
offices
from
many
of
which
the
incumbents
had
been
remorselessly
ejected
many
had
been
created
for
the
purpose
of
sale
the
integrity
and
capacity
of
an
applicant
were
never
inquired
into
the
points
considered
were
what
services
has
he
rendered
or
can
he
render
to
the
party
how
much
can
he
pay
for
the
preferment
an
american
reader
can
thoroughly
realize
this
state
of
things
at
every
presidential
election
he
witnesses
similar
acts
the
election
of
a
pope
by
the
conclave
is
not
unlike
the
nomination
of
an
american
president
by
a
convention
in
both
cases
there
are
many
offices
to
give
away
william
of
malmesbury
says
that
in
his
day
the
romans
made
a
sale
of
whatever
was
righteous
and
sacred
for
gold
after
his
time
there
was
no
improvement
the
church
degenerated
into
an
instrument
for
the
exploitation
of
money
vast
sums
were
collected
in
italy
vast
sums
were
drawn
under
all
manner
of
pretenses
from
surrounding
and
reluctant
countries
of
these
the
most
nefarious
was
the
sale
of
indulgences
for
the
perpetration
of
sin
italian
religion
had
become
the
art
of
plundering
the
people
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
the
sovereign
pontiffs
had
been
rulers
of
the
city
true
it
had
witnessed
many
scenes
of
devastation
for
which
they
were
not
responsible
but
they
were
responsible
for
this
that
they
had
never
made
any
vigorous
any
persistent
effort
for
its
material
its
moral
improvement
instead
of
being
in
these
respects
an
exemplar
for
the
imitation
of
the
world
it
became
an
exemplar
of
a
condition
that
ought
to
be
shunned
things
steadily
went
on
from
bad
to
worse
until
at
the
epoch
of
the
reformation
no
pious
stranger
could
visit
it
without
being
shocked
the
papacy
repudiating
science
as
absolutely
incompatible
with
its
pretensions
had
in
later
years
addressed
itself
to
the
encouragement
of
art
but
music
and
painting
though
they
may
be
exquisite
adornments
of
life
contain
no
living
force
that
can
develop
a
weak
nation
into
a
strong
one
nothing
that
can
permanently
assure
the
material
or
happiness
of
communities
and
hence
at
the
time
of
the
reformation
to
one
who
thoughtfully
considered
her
condition
rome
had
lost
all
living
energy
she
was
no
longer
the
arbiter
of
the
physical
or
the
religious
progress
of
the
world
for
the
progressive
maxims
of
the
republic
and
the
empire
she
had
substituted
the
stationary
maxims
of
the
papacy
she
had
the
appearance
of
piety
and
the
possession
of
art
in
this
she
resembled
one
of
those
which
we
still
see
in
their
brown
cowls
in
the
vaults
of
the
cappuccini
with
a
breviary
or
some
withered
flowers
in
its
hands
from
this
view
of
the
eternal
city
this
survey
of
what
latin
christianity
had
done
for
rome
itself
let
us
turn
to
the
whole
european
continent
let
us
try
to
determine
the
true
value
of
the
system
that
was
guiding
society
let
us
judge
it
by
its
fruits
the
condition
of
nations
as
to
their
is
most
precisely
represented
by
the
variations
of
their
population
forms
of
government
have
very
little
influence
on
population
but
policy
may
control
it
completely
it
has
been
very
satisfactorily
shown
by
authors
who
have
given
attention
to
the
subject
that
the
variations
of
population
depend
upon
the
interbalancing
of
the
generative
force
of
society
and
the
resistances
to
life
by
the
generative
force
of
society
is
meant
that
instinct
which
manifests
itself
in
the
multiplication
of
the
race
to
some
extent
it
depends
on
climate
but
since
the
climate
of
europe
did
not
sensibly
change
between
the
fourth
and
the
sixteenth
centuries
we
may
regard
this
force
as
having
been
on
that
continent
during
the
period
under
consideration
invariable
by
the
resistances
to
life
is
meant
whatever
tends
to
make
individual
existence
more
difficult
of
support
among
such
may
be
enumerated
insufficient
food
inadequate
clothing
imperfect
shelter
it
is
also
known
that
if
the
resistances
become
inappreciable
the
generative
force
will
double
a
population
in
years
the
resistances
operate
in
two
modes
physically
since
they
diminish
the
number
of
births
and
shorten
the
term
of
the
life
of
all
intellectually
since
in
a
moral
and
particularly
in
a
religious
community
they
postpone
marriage
by
causing
individuals
to
decline
its
responsibilities
until
they
feel
that
they
are
competent
to
meet
the
charges
and
cares
of
a
family
hence
the
explanation
of
a
fact
that
the
number
of
marriages
during
a
given
period
has
a
connection
with
the
price
of
food
the
increase
of
population
keeps
pace
with
the
increase
of
food
and
indeed
such
being
the
power
of
the
generative
force
it
overpasses
the
means
of
subsistence
establishing
a
constant
pressure
upon
them
under
these
circumstances
it
necessarily
happens
that
a
certain
amount
of
destitution
must
occur
individuals
have
come
into
existence
who
must
be
starved
as
illustrations
of
the
variations
that
have
occurred
in
the
population
of
different
countries
may
be
mentioned
the
immense
diminution
of
that
of
italy
in
consequence
of
the
wars
of
justinian
the
depopulation
of
north
africa
in
consequence
of
theological
quarrels
its
restoration
through
the
establishment
of
mohammedanism
the
increase
of
that
of
all
europe
through
the
feudal
system
when
estates
became
more
valuable
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
retainers
they
could
supply
the
crusades
caused
a
sensible
diminution
not
only
through
the
enormous
army
losses
but
also
by
reason
of
the
withdrawal
of
so
many
men
from
similar
variations
have
occurred
on
the
american
continent
the
population
of
mexico
was
very
quickly
diminished
by
two
million
through
the
rapacity
and
atrocious
cruelty
of
the
spaniards
who
drove
the
civilized
indians
to
despair
the
same
happened
in
peru
the
population
of
england
at
the
norman
conquest
was
about
two
million
in
five
hundred
years
it
had
scarcely
doubled
it
may
be
supposed
that
this
stationary
condition
was
to
some
extent
induced
by
the
papal
policy
of
the
enforcement
of
celibacy
in
the
clergy
the
legal
generative
force
was
doubtless
affected
by
that
policy
the
actual
generative
force
was
not
for
those
who
have
made
this
subject
their
study
have
long
ago
been
satisfied
that
public
celibacy
is
private
wickedness
this
mainly
determined
the
laity
as
well
as
the
government
in
england
to
suppress
the
monasteries
it
was
openly
asserted
that
there
were
one
hundred
thousand
women
in
england
made
dissolute
by
the
clergy
in
my
history
of
the
american
civil
war
i
have
presented
some
reflections
on
this
point
which
i
will
take
the
liberty
of
quoting
here
what
then
does
this
stationary
condition
of
the
population
mean
it
means
food
obtained
with
hardship
insufficient
clothing
personal
uncleanness
cabins
that
could
not
keep
out
the
weather
the
destructive
effects
of
cold
and
heat
miasm
want
of
sanitary
provisions
absence
of
physicians
uselessness
of
the
deceptiveness
of
miracles
in
which
society
was
putting
its
trust
or
to
sum
up
a
long
catalogue
of
sorrows
wants
and
sufferings
in
one
term
it
means
a
high
but
more
it
means
deficient
births
and
what
does
that
point
out
marriage
postponed
licentious
life
private
wickedness
demoralized
society
to
an
american
who
lives
in
a
country
that
was
yesterday
an
interminable
and
impenetrable
desert
but
which
is
filling
with
a
population
doubling
itself
every
years
at
the
prescribed
rate
this
awful
waste
of
actual
and
contingent
life
can
not
but
be
a
most
surprising
fact
his
curiosity
will
lead
him
to
inquire
what
kind
of
system
that
could
have
been
which
was
pretending
to
guide
and
develop
society
but
which
must
be
held
responsible
for
this
prodigious
destruction
excelling
in
its
insidious
result
war
pestilence
and
famine
combined
insidious
for
men
were
actually
believing
that
it
secured
their
highest
temporal
interests
how
different
now
in
england
the
same
geographical
surface
is
sustaining
ten
times
the
population
of
that
day
and
sending
forth
its
emigrating
swarms
let
him
who
looks
back
with
veneration
on
the
past
settle
in
his
own
mind
what
such
a
system
could
have
been
worth
these
variations
in
the
population
of
europe
have
been
attended
with
changes
in
distribution
the
centre
of
population
has
passed
northward
since
the
establishment
of
christianity
in
the
roman
empire
it
has
since
passed
westward
in
consequence
of
the
development
of
manufacturing
industry
we
may
now
examine
somewhat
more
minutely
the
character
of
the
resistances
which
thus
for
a
thousand
years
kept
the
population
of
europe
stationary
the
surface
of
the
continent
was
for
the
most
part
covered
with
pathless
forests
here
and
there
it
was
dotted
with
monasteries
and
towns
in
the
lowlands
and
along
the
were
fens
sometimes
hundreds
of
miles
in
extent
exhaling
their
pestiferous
miasms
and
spreading
agues
far
and
wide
in
paris
and
london
the
houses
were
of
wood
daubed
with
clay
and
thatched
with
straw
or
reeds
they
had
no
windows
and
until
the
invention
of
the
very
few
had
wooden
floors
the
luxury
of
a
carpet
was
unknown
some
straw
scattered
in
the
room
supplied
its
place
there
were
no
chimneys
the
smoke
of
the
cheerless
fire
escaped
through
a
hole
in
the
roof
in
such
habitations
there
was
scarcely
any
protection
from
the
weather
no
attempt
was
made
at
drainage
but
the
putrefying
garbage
and
rubbish
were
simply
thrown
out
of
the
door
men
women
and
children
slept
in
the
same
apartment
not
unfrequently
domestic
animals
were
their
companions
in
such
a
confusion
of
the
family
it
was
impossible
that
modesty
or
morality
could
be
maintained
the
bed
was
usually
a
bag
of
straw
a
wooden
log
served
as
a
pillow
personal
cleanliness
was
utterly
unknown
great
officers
of
state
even
dignitaries
so
high
as
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
swarmed
with
vermin
such
it
is
related
was
the
condition
of
thomas
a
becket
the
antagonist
of
an
english
king
to
conceal
personal
impurity
perfumes
were
necessarily
and
profusely
used
the
citizen
clothed
himself
in
leather
a
garment
which
with
its
impurity
might
last
for
many
years
he
was
considered
to
be
in
circumstances
of
ease
if
he
could
procure
fresh
meat
once
a
week
for
his
dinner
the
streets
had
no
sewers
they
were
without
pavement
or
lamps
after
nightfall
the
were
thrown
open
and
slops
unceremoniously
emptied
down
to
the
discomfiture
of
the
wayfarer
tracking
his
path
through
the
narrow
streets
with
his
dismal
lantern
in
his
hand
aeneas
sylvius
who
afterward
became
pope
pius
and
was
therefore
a
very
competent
and
impartial
writer
has
left
us
a
graphic
account
of
a
journey
he
made
to
the
british
islands
about
he
describes
the
houses
of
the
peasantry
as
constructed
of
stones
put
together
without
mortar
the
roofs
were
of
turf
a
stiffened
served
for
a
door
the
food
consisted
of
coarse
vegetable
products
such
as
peas
and
even
the
bark
of
trees
in
some
places
they
were
unacquainted
with
bread
cabins
of
reeds
plastered
with
mud
houses
of
wattled
stakes
chimneyless
from
which
there
was
scarcely
an
escape
for
the
smoke
dens
of
physical
and
moral
pollution
swarming
with
vermin
wisps
of
straw
twisted
round
the
limbs
to
keep
off
the
cold
the
peasant
with
no
help
except
how
was
it
possible
that
the
population
could
increase
shall
we
then
wonder
that
in
the
famine
of
human
flesh
was
cooked
and
sold
or
that
in
that
of
fifteen
thousand
persons
died
of
hunger
in
london
shall
we
wonder
that
in
some
of
the
invasions
of
the
plague
the
deaths
were
so
frightfully
numerous
that
the
living
could
hardly
bury
the
dead
by
that
of
which
came
from
the
east
along
the
lines
of
commercial
travel
and
spread
all
over
europe
of
the
population
of
france
was
destroyed
such
was
the
condition
of
the
peasantry
and
of
the
common
inhabitants
of
cities
not
much
better
was
that
of
the
nobles
william
of
malmesbury
speaking
of
the
degraded
manners
of
the
says
their
nobles
devoted
to
gluttony
and
voluptuousness
never
visited
the
church
but
the
matins
and
the
mass
were
read
over
to
them
by
a
hurrying
priest
in
their
bedchambers
before
they
rose
themselves
not
listening
the
common
people
were
a
prey
to
the
more
powerful
their
property
was
seized
their
bodies
dragged
away
to
distant
countries
their
maidens
were
either
thrown
into
a
brothel
or
sold
for
slaves
drinking
day
and
night
was
the
general
pursuit
vices
the
companions
of
inebriety
followed
effeminating
the
manly
mind
the
baronial
castles
were
dens
of
robbers
the
saxon
chronicler
records
how
men
and
women
were
caught
and
dragged
into
those
strongholds
hung
up
by
their
thumbs
or
feet
fire
applied
to
them
knotted
strings
twisted
round
their
heads
and
many
other
torments
inflicted
to
extort
ransom
all
over
europe
the
great
and
profitable
political
offices
were
filled
by
ecclesiastics
in
every
country
there
was
a
dual
government
that
of
a
local
kind
represented
by
a
temporal
sovereign
that
of
a
foreign
kind
acknowledging
the
authority
of
the
pope
this
roman
influence
was
in
the
nature
of
things
superior
to
the
local
it
expressed
the
sovereign
will
of
one
man
over
all
the
nations
of
the
continent
conjointly
and
gathered
overwhelming
power
from
its
compactness
and
unity
the
local
influence
was
necessarily
of
a
feeble
nature
since
it
was
commonly
weakened
by
the
rivalries
of
conterminous
states
and
the
dissensions
dexterously
provoked
by
its
competitor
on
not
a
single
occasion
could
the
various
european
states
form
a
coalition
against
their
common
antagonist
whenever
a
question
arose
they
were
skillfully
taken
in
detail
and
commonly
mastered
the
ostensible
object
of
papal
intrusion
was
to
secure
for
the
different
peoples
moral
the
real
object
was
to
obtain
large
revenues
and
give
support
to
vast
bodies
of
ecclesiastics
the
revenues
thus
abstracted
were
not
infrequently
many
times
greater
than
those
passing
into
the
treasury
of
the
local
power
thus
on
the
occasion
of
innocent
iv
demanding
provision
to
be
made
for
three
hundred
additional
italian
clergy
by
the
church
of
england
and
that
one
of
his
nephews
a
mere
boy
should
have
a
stall
in
lincoln
cathedral
it
was
found
that
the
sum
already
annually
abstracted
by
foreign
ecclesiastics
from
england
was
thrice
that
which
went
into
the
coffers
of
the
king
while
thus
the
higher
clergy
secured
every
political
appointment
worth
having
and
abbots
vied
with
counts
in
the
herds
of
slaves
they
possessed
some
it
is
said
owned
not
fewer
than
twenty
thousand
begging
friars
pervaded
society
in
all
directions
picking
up
a
share
of
what
still
remained
to
the
poor
there
was
a
vast
body
of
living
in
idleness
and
owning
a
foreign
allegiance
who
were
subsisting
on
the
fruits
of
the
toil
of
the
laborers
it
could
not
be
otherwise
than
that
small
farms
should
be
unceasingly
merged
into
the
larger
estates
that
the
poor
should
steadily
become
poorer
that
society
far
from
improving
should
exhibit
a
continually
increasing
demoralization
outside
the
monastic
institutions
no
attempt
at
intellectual
advancement
was
made
indeed
so
far
as
the
laity
were
concerned
the
influence
of
the
church
was
directed
to
an
opposite
result
for
the
maxim
universally
received
was
that
ignorance
is
the
mother
of
devotion
the
settled
practice
of
republican
and
imperial
rome
was
to
have
swift
communication
with
all
her
outlying
provinces
by
means
of
substantial
bridges
and
roads
one
of
the
prime
duties
of
the
legions
was
to
construct
them
and
keep
them
in
repair
by
this
her
military
authority
was
assured
but
the
dominion
of
papal
rome
depending
upon
a
different
principle
had
no
exigencies
of
that
kind
and
this
duty
accordingly
was
left
for
the
local
powers
to
neglect
and
so
in
all
directions
the
roads
were
almost
impassable
for
a
large
part
of
the
year
a
common
means
of
transportation
was
in
clumsy
carts
drawn
by
oxen
going
at
the
most
but
three
or
four
miles
an
hour
where
along
rivers
could
not
be
had
and
mules
were
resorted
to
for
the
transportation
of
merchandise
an
adequate
means
for
the
slender
commerce
of
the
times
when
large
bodies
of
men
had
to
be
moved
the
difficulties
became
almost
insuperable
of
this
perhaps
one
of
the
best
illustrations
may
be
found
in
the
story
of
the
march
of
the
first
crusaders
these
restraints
upon
intercommunication
tended
powerfully
to
promote
the
general
benighted
condition
journeys
by
individuals
could
not
be
undertaken
without
much
risk
for
there
was
scarcely
a
moor
or
a
forest
that
had
not
its
highwaymen
an
illiterate
condition
everywhere
prevailing
gave
opportunity
for
the
development
of
superstition
europe
was
full
of
disgraceful
miracles
on
all
the
roads
pilgrims
were
wending
their
way
to
the
shrines
of
saints
renowned
for
the
cures
they
had
wrought
it
had
always
been
the
policy
of
the
church
to
discourage
the
physician
and
his
art
he
interfered
too
much
with
the
gifts
and
profits
of
the
shrines
time
has
brought
this
once
lucrative
imposture
to
its
proper
value
how
many
shrines
are
there
now
in
successful
operation
in
europe
for
patients
too
sick
to
move
or
be
moved
there
were
no
remedies
except
those
of
a
ghostly
kind
the
or
the
for
the
prevention
of
diseases
prayers
were
put
up
in
the
churches
but
no
sanitary
measures
were
resorted
to
from
cities
reeking
with
putrefying
filth
it
was
thought
that
the
plague
might
be
stayed
by
the
prayers
of
the
priests
by
them
rain
and
dry
weather
might
be
secured
and
deliverance
obtained
from
the
baleful
influences
of
eclipses
and
comets
but
when
halley
comet
came
in
so
tremendous
was
its
apparition
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
pope
himself
to
interfere
he
exorcised
and
expelled
it
from
the
skies
it
slunk
away
into
the
abysses
of
space
by
the
maledictions
of
calixtus
and
did
not
venture
back
for
years
the
physical
value
of
and
ghostly
remedies
is
measured
by
the
in
those
days
it
was
probably
about
one
in
under
the
present
more
material
practice
it
is
about
one
in
forty
the
moral
condition
of
europe
was
signally
illustrated
when
syphilis
was
introduced
from
the
west
indies
by
the
companions
of
columbus
it
spread
with
wonderful
rapidity
all
ranks
of
persons
from
the
holy
father
leo
to
the
beggar
by
the
wayside
contracting
the
shameful
disease
many
excused
their
misfortune
by
declaring
that
it
was
an
epidemic
proceeding
from
a
certain
malignity
in
the
constitution
of
the
air
but
in
truth
its
spread
was
due
to
a
certain
infirmity
in
the
constitution
of
man
an
infirmity
which
had
not
been
removed
by
the
spiritual
guidance
under
which
he
had
been
living
to
the
medical
efficacy
of
shrines
must
be
added
that
of
special
relics
these
were
sometimes
of
the
most
extraordinary
kind
there
were
several
abbeys
that
possessed
our
savior
crown
of
thorns
eleven
had
the
lance
that
had
pierced
his
side
if
any
person
was
adventurous
enough
to
suggest
that
these
could
not
all
be
authentic
he
would
have
been
denounced
as
an
atheist
during
the
holy
wars
the
had
driven
a
profitable
commerce
by
bringing
from
jerusalem
to
the
crusading
armies
bottles
of
the
milk
of
the
blessed
virgin
which
they
sold
for
enormous
sums
these
bottles
were
preserved
with
pious
care
in
many
of
the
great
religious
establishments
but
perhaps
none
of
these
impostures
surpassed
in
audacity
that
offered
by
a
monastery
in
jerusalem
which
presented
to
the
beholder
one
of
the
fingers
of
the
holy
ghost
modern
society
has
silently
rendered
its
verdict
on
these
scandalous
objects
though
they
once
nourished
the
piety
of
thousands
of
earnest
people
they
are
now
considered
too
vile
to
have
a
place
in
any
public
museum
how
shall
we
account
for
the
great
failure
we
thus
detect
in
the
guardianship
of
the
church
over
europe
this
is
not
the
result
that
must
have
occurred
had
there
been
in
rome
an
unremitting
care
for
the
spiritual
and
material
prosperity
of
the
continent
had
the
universal
pastor
the
successor
of
peter
occupied
himself
with
singleness
of
purpose
for
the
holiness
and
happiness
of
his
flock
the
explanation
is
not
difficult
to
find
it
is
contained
in
a
story
of
sin
and
shame
i
prefer
therefore
in
the
following
paragraphs
to
offer
explanatory
facts
derived
from
catholic
authors
and
indeed
to
present
them
as
nearly
as
i
can
in
the
words
of
those
writers
the
story
i
am
about
to
relate
is
a
narrative
of
the
transformation
of
a
confederacy
into
an
absolute
monarchy
in
the
early
times
every
church
without
prejudice
to
its
agreement
with
the
church
universal
in
all
essential
points
managed
its
own
affairs
with
perfect
freedom
and
independence
maintaining
its
own
traditional
usages
and
discipline
all
questions
not
concerning
the
whole
church
or
of
primary
importance
being
settled
on
the
spot
until
the
beginning
of
the
ninth
century
there
was
no
change
in
the
constitution
of
the
roman
church
but
about
the
isidorian
decretals
were
fabricated
in
the
west
of
gaul
a
forgery
containing
about
one
hundred
pretended
decrees
of
the
early
popes
together
with
certain
spurious
writings
of
other
church
dignitaries
and
acts
of
synods
this
forgery
produced
an
immense
extension
of
the
papal
power
it
displaced
the
old
system
of
church
government
divesting
it
of
the
republican
attributes
it
had
possessed
and
transforming
it
into
an
absolute
monarchy
it
brought
the
bishops
into
subjection
to
rome
and
made
the
pontiff
the
supreme
judge
of
the
clergy
of
the
whole
christian
world
it
prepared
the
way
for
the
great
attempt
subsequently
made
by
hildebrand
to
convert
the
states
of
europe
into
a
theocratic
with
the
pope
at
its
head
gregory
the
author
of
this
great
attempt
saw
that
his
plans
would
be
best
carried
out
through
the
agency
of
synods
he
therefore
restricted
the
right
of
holding
them
to
the
popes
and
their
legates
to
aid
in
the
matter
a
new
system
of
church
law
was
devised
by
anselm
of
lucca
partly
from
the
old
isidorian
forgeries
and
partly
from
new
inventions
to
establish
the
supremacy
of
rome
not
only
had
a
new
civil
and
a
new
canon
law
to
be
produced
a
new
history
had
also
to
be
invented
this
furnished
needful
instances
of
the
deposition
and
excommunication
of
kings
and
proved
that
they
had
always
been
subordinate
to
the
popes
the
decretal
letters
of
the
popes
were
put
on
a
par
with
scripture
at
length
it
came
to
be
received
throughout
the
west
that
the
popes
had
been
from
the
beginning
of
christianity
legislators
for
the
whole
church
as
absolute
sovereigns
in
later
times
can
not
endure
representative
assemblies
so
the
papacy
when
it
wished
to
become
absolute
found
that
the
synods
of
particular
national
churches
must
be
put
an
end
to
and
those
only
under
the
immediate
control
of
the
pontiff
permitted
this
in
itself
constituted
a
great
revolution
another
fiction
concocted
in
rome
in
the
eighth
century
led
to
important
consequences
it
feigned
that
the
emperor
constantine
in
gratitude
for
his
cure
from
leprosy
and
baptism
by
pope
sylvester
had
bestowed
italy
and
the
western
provinces
on
the
pope
and
that
in
token
of
his
subordination
he
had
served
the
pope
as
his
groom
and
led
his
horse
some
distance
this
forgery
was
intended
to
work
on
the
frankish
kings
to
impress
them
with
a
correct
idea
of
their
inferiority
and
to
show
that
in
the
territorial
concessions
they
made
to
the
church
they
were
not
giving
but
only
restoring
what
rightfully
belonged
to
it
the
most
potent
instrument
of
the
new
papal
system
was
decretum
which
was
issued
about
the
middle
of
the
twelfth
century
it
was
a
mass
of
fabrications
it
made
the
whole
christian
world
through
the
papacy
the
domain
of
the
italian
clergy
it
inculcated
that
it
is
lawful
to
constrain
men
to
goodness
to
torture
and
execute
heretics
and
to
confiscate
their
property
that
to
kill
an
excommunicated
person
is
not
murder
that
the
pope
in
his
unlimited
superiority
to
all
law
stands
on
an
equality
with
the
son
of
god
as
the
new
system
of
centralization
developed
maxims
that
in
the
olden
times
would
have
been
held
to
be
shocking
were
boldly
avowed
the
whole
church
is
the
property
of
the
pope
to
do
with
as
he
will
what
is
simony
in
others
is
not
simony
in
him
he
is
above
all
law
and
can
be
called
to
account
by
none
whoever
disobeys
him
must
be
put
to
death
every
baptized
man
is
his
subject
and
must
for
life
remain
so
whether
he
will
or
not
up
to
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
the
popes
were
the
vicars
of
peter
after
innocent
iii
they
were
the
vicars
of
christ
but
an
absolute
sovereign
has
need
of
revenues
and
to
this
the
popes
were
no
exception
the
institution
of
legates
was
brought
in
from
hildebrand
time
sometimes
their
duty
was
to
visit
churches
sometimes
they
were
sent
on
special
business
but
always
invested
with
unlimited
powers
to
bring
back
money
over
the
alps
and
since
the
pope
could
not
only
make
laws
but
could
suspend
their
operation
a
legislation
was
introduced
in
view
to
the
purchase
of
dispensations
monasteries
were
exempted
from
episcopal
jurisdiction
on
payment
of
a
tribute
to
rome
the
pope
had
now
become
the
universal
bishop
he
had
a
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
all
the
dioceses
and
could
bring
any
cases
before
his
own
courts
his
relation
to
the
bishops
was
that
of
an
absolute
sovereign
to
his
officials
a
bishop
could
resign
only
by
his
permission
and
sees
vacated
by
resignation
lapsed
to
him
appeals
to
him
were
encouraged
in
every
way
for
the
sake
of
the
dispensations
thousands
of
processes
came
before
the
curia
bringing
a
rich
harvest
to
rome
often
when
there
were
disputing
claimants
to
benefices
the
pope
would
oust
them
all
and
appoint
a
creature
of
his
own
often
the
candidates
had
to
waste
years
in
rome
and
either
died
there
or
carried
back
a
vivid
impression
of
the
dominant
corruption
germany
suffered
more
than
other
countries
from
these
appeals
and
processes
and
hence
of
all
countries
was
best
prepared
for
the
reformation
during
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
the
popes
made
gigantic
strides
in
the
acquisition
of
power
instead
of
recommending
their
favorites
for
benefices
now
they
issued
mandates
their
italian
partisans
must
be
rewarded
nothing
could
be
done
to
satisfy
their
clamors
but
to
provide
for
them
in
foreign
countries
shoals
of
contesting
claimants
died
in
rome
and
when
death
took
place
in
that
city
the
pope
claimed
the
right
of
giving
away
the
benefices
at
length
it
was
affirmed
that
he
had
the
right
of
disposing
of
all
without
distinction
and
that
the
oath
of
obedience
of
a
bishop
to
him
implied
political
as
well
as
ecclesiastical
subjection
in
countries
having
a
dual
government
this
increased
the
power
of
the
spiritual
element
prodigiously
rights
of
every
kind
were
remorselessly
overthrown
to
complete
this
centralization
in
this
the
mendicant
orders
were
most
efficient
aids
it
was
the
pope
and
those
orders
on
one
side
the
bishops
and
the
parochial
clergy
on
the
other
the
roman
court
had
seized
the
rights
of
synods
metropolitans
bishops
national
churches
incessantly
interfered
with
by
the
legates
the
bishops
lost
all
desire
to
discipline
their
dioceses
incessantly
interfered
with
by
the
begging
monks
the
parish
priest
had
become
powerless
in
his
own
village
his
pastoral
influence
was
utterly
destroyed
by
the
papal
indulgences
and
absolutions
they
sold
the
money
was
carried
off
to
rome
pecuniary
necessities
urged
many
of
the
popes
to
resort
to
such
petty
expedients
as
to
require
from
a
prince
a
bishop
or
a
who
had
a
cause
pending
in
the
court
a
present
of
a
golden
cup
filled
with
ducats
such
necessities
also
gave
origin
to
jubilees
sixtus
iv
established
whole
colleges
and
sold
the
places
at
three
or
four
hundred
ducats
innocent
viii
pawned
the
papal
tiara
of
leo
it
was
said
that
he
squandered
the
revenues
of
three
popes
he
wasted
the
savings
of
his
predecessor
he
spent
his
own
income
he
anticipated
that
of
his
successor
he
created
hundred
and
fifty
new
offices
and
sold
them
they
were
considered
to
be
a
good
investment
as
they
produced
twelve
per
cent
the
interest
was
extorted
from
catholic
countries
nowhere
in
europe
could
capital
be
so
well
invested
as
at
rome
large
sums
were
raised
by
the
foreclosing
of
mortgages
and
not
only
by
the
sale
but
the
resale
of
offices
men
were
promoted
for
the
purpose
of
selling
their
offices
again
though
against
the
papal
theory
which
denounced
usurious
practices
an
immense
papal
banking
system
had
sprung
up
in
connection
with
the
curia
and
sums
at
usurious
interest
were
advanced
to
prelates
and
litigants
the
papal
bankers
were
privileged
all
others
were
under
the
ban
the
curia
had
discovered
that
it
was
for
their
interest
to
have
ecclesiastics
all
over
europe
in
their
debt
they
could
make
them
pliant
and
excommunicate
them
for
of
interest
in
it
was
reckoned
that
half
the
christian
world
was
under
excommunication
bishops
were
excommunicated
because
they
could
not
meet
the
extortions
of
legates
and
persons
were
excommunicated
under
various
pretenses
to
compel
them
to
purchase
absolution
at
an
exorbitant
price
the
ecclesiastical
revenues
of
all
europe
were
flowing
into
rome
a
sink
of
corruption
simony
usury
bribery
extortion
the
popes
since
when
the
great
centralizing
movement
began
had
no
time
to
pay
attention
to
the
internal
affairs
of
their
own
special
flock
in
the
city
of
rome
there
were
thousands
of
foreign
cases
each
bringing
in
money
whenever
says
the
bishop
alvaro
pelayo
i
entered
the
apartments
of
the
roman
court
clergy
i
found
them
occupied
in
counting
up
the
which
lay
about
the
rooms
in
heaps
every
opportunity
of
extending
the
jurisdiction
of
the
curia
was
welcome
exemptions
were
so
managed
that
fresh
grants
were
constantly
necessary
bishops
were
privileged
against
cathedral
chapters
chapters
against
their
bishops
bishops
convents
and
individuals
against
the
extortions
of
legates
the
two
pillars
on
which
the
papal
system
now
rested
were
the
college
of
cardinals
and
the
curia
the
cardinals
in
had
become
electors
of
the
popes
up
to
that
time
elections
were
made
by
the
whole
body
of
the
roman
clergy
and
the
concurrence
of
the
magistrates
and
citizens
was
necessary
but
nicolas
ii
restricted
elections
to
the
college
of
cardinals
by
a
vote
and
gave
to
the
german
emperor
the
right
of
confirmation
for
almost
two
centuries
there
was
a
struggle
for
mastery
between
the
cardinal
oligarchy
and
papal
absolutism
the
cardinals
were
willing
enough
that
the
pope
should
be
absolute
in
his
foreign
rule
but
they
never
failed
to
attempt
before
giving
him
their
votes
to
bind
him
to
accord
to
them
a
recognized
share
in
the
government
after
his
election
and
before
his
consecration
he
swore
to
observe
certain
capitulations
such
as
a
participation
of
revenues
between
himself
and
the
cardinals
an
obligation
that
he
would
not
remove
them
but
would
permit
them
to
assemble
twice
a
year
to
discuss
whether
he
had
kept
his
oath
repeatedly
the
popes
broke
their
oath
on
one
side
the
cardinals
wanted
a
larger
share
in
the
church
government
and
emoluments
on
the
other
the
popes
refused
to
surrender
revenues
or
power
the
cardinals
wanted
to
be
conspicuous
in
pomp
and
extravagance
and
for
this
vast
sums
were
requisite
in
one
instance
not
fewer
than
five
hundred
benefices
were
held
by
one
of
them
their
friends
and
retainers
must
be
supplied
their
families
enriched
it
was
affirmed
that
the
whole
revenues
of
france
were
insufficient
to
meet
their
expenditures
in
their
rivalries
it
sometimes
happened
that
no
pope
was
elected
for
several
years
it
seemed
as
if
they
wanted
to
show
how
easily
the
church
could
get
on
without
the
vicar
of
christ
toward
the
close
of
the
eleventh
century
the
roman
church
became
the
roman
court
in
place
of
the
christian
sheep
gently
following
their
shepherd
in
the
holy
precincts
of
the
city
there
had
arisen
a
chancery
of
writers
notaries
where
transactions
about
privileges
dispensations
exemptions
were
carried
on
and
suitors
went
with
petitions
from
door
to
door
rome
was
a
for
of
every
nation
in
presence
of
the
enormous
mass
of
graces
indulgences
absolutions
commands
and
decisions
addressed
to
all
parts
of
europe
and
asia
the
functions
of
the
local
church
sank
into
insignificance
several
hundred
persons
whose
home
was
the
curia
were
required
their
aim
was
to
rise
in
it
by
enlarging
the
profits
of
the
papal
treasury
the
whole
christian
world
had
become
tributary
to
it
here
every
vestige
of
religion
had
disappeared
its
members
were
busy
with
politics
litigations
and
processes
not
a
word
could
be
heard
about
spiritual
concerns
every
stroke
of
the
pen
had
its
price
benefices
dispensations
licenses
absolutions
indulgences
privileges
were
bought
and
sold
like
merchandise
the
suitor
had
to
bribe
every
one
from
the
doorkeeper
to
the
pope
or
his
case
was
lost
poor
men
could
neither
attain
preferment
nor
hope
for
it
and
the
result
was
that
every
cleric
felt
he
had
a
right
to
follow
the
example
he
had
seen
at
rome
and
that
he
might
make
profits
out
of
his
spiritual
ministries
and
sacraments
having
bought
the
right
to
do
so
at
rome
and
having
no
other
way
to
pay
off
his
debt
the
transference
of
power
from
italians
to
frenchmen
through
the
removal
of
the
curia
to
avignon
produced
no
change
only
the
italians
felt
that
the
enrichment
of
italian
families
had
slipped
out
of
their
grasp
they
had
learned
to
consider
the
papacy
as
their
appanage
and
that
they
under
the
christian
dispensation
were
chosen
people
as
the
jews
had
been
under
the
mosaic
at
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
a
new
kingdom
was
discovered
capable
of
yielding
immense
revenues
this
was
purgatory
it
was
shown
that
the
pope
could
empty
it
by
his
indulgences
in
this
there
was
no
need
of
hypocrisy
things
were
done
openly
the
original
germ
of
the
apostolic
primacy
had
now
expanded
into
a
colossal
monarchy
need
of
a
general
council
the
inquisition
had
made
the
papal
system
irresistible
all
opposition
must
be
punished
with
death
by
fire
a
mere
thought
without
having
betrayed
itself
by
outward
sign
was
considered
as
guilt
as
time
went
on
this
practice
of
the
inquisition
became
more
and
more
atrocious
torture
was
resorted
to
on
mere
suspicion
the
accused
was
not
allowed
to
know
the
name
of
his
accuser
he
was
not
permitted
to
have
any
legal
adviser
there
was
no
appeal
the
inquisition
was
ordered
not
to
lean
to
pity
no
recantation

of
misbelievers
and
that
merely
as
an
act
of

the
consequence
was
that
popes
such
as
nicolas
enriched
their
families
through
plunder
acquired
by
this
tribunal
inquisitors
did
the
same
habitually
the
struggle
between
the
french
and
italians
for
the
possession
of
the
papacy
inevitably
led
to
the
schism
of
the
fourteenth
century
for
more
than
forty
years
two
rival
popes
were
now
anathematizing
each
other
two
rival
curias
were
squeezing
the
nations
for
money
eventually
there
were
three
obediences
and
triple
revenues
to
be
extorted
nobody
now
could
guarantee
the
validity
of
the
sacraments
for
nobody
could
be
sure
which
was
the
true
pope
men
were
thus
compelled
to
think
for
themselves
they
could
not
find
who
was
the
legitimate
thinker
for
them
they
began
to
see
that
the
church
must
rid
herself
of
the
curialistic
chains
and
resort
to
a
general
council
that
attempt
was
again
and
again
made
the
intention
being
to
raise
the
council
into
a
parliament
of
christendom
and
make
the
pope
its
chief
executive
officer
but
the
vast
interests
that
had
grown
out
of
the
corruption
of
ages
could
not
so
easily
be
overcome
the
curia
again
recovered
its
ascendency
and
ecclesiastical
trading
was
resumed
the
germans
who
had
never
been
permitted
to
share
in
the
curia
took
the
leading
part
in
these
attempts
at
reform
as
things
went
on
from
bad
to
worse
even
they
at
last
found
out
that
all
hope
of
reforming
the
church
by
means
of
councils
was
delusive
erasmus
exclaimed
if
christ
does
not
deliver
his
people

this
multiform
ecclesiastical
tyranny

intolerable
cardinals
hats
were
now
sold

under

ecclesiastical
and
religious

were
actually
put
up
to
auction
the
maxim
of

become

first
honor
afterward
among
the

there
was
not
one
who
could
be
honest
in
the
dark
and
virtuous
without
a
witness
the
velvet
cloaks
and
white
ermine
capes
of
the
cardinals
were
truly
a
cover
for
wickedness
the
unity
of
the
church
and
therefore
its
power
required
the
use
of
latin
as
a
sacred
language
through
this
rome
had
stood
in
an
attitude
strictly
european
and
was
enabled
to
maintain
a
general
international
relation
it
gave
her
far
more
power
than
her
asserted
celestial
authority
and
much
as
she
claims
to
have
done
she
is
open
to
condemnation
that
with
such
a
signal
advantage
in
her
hands
never
again
to
be
enjoyed
by
any
successor
she
did
not
accomplish
much
more
had
not
the
sovereign
pontiffs
been
so
completely
occupied
with
maintaining
their
emoluments
and
temporalities
in
italy
they
might
have
made
the
whole
continent
advance
like
one
man
their
officials
could
pass
without
difficulty
into
every
nation
and
communicate
without
embarrassment
with
each
other
from
ireland
to
bohemia
from
italy
to
scotland
the
possession
of
a
common
tongue
gave
them
the
administration
of
international
affairs
with
intelligent
allies
everywhere
speaking
the
same
language
not
without
cause
was
the
hatred
manifested
by
rome
to
the
restoration
of
greek
and
introduction
of
hebrew
and
the
alarm
with
which
she
perceived
the
modern
languages
forming
out
of
the
vulgar
dialects
not
without
reason
did
the
faculty
of
theology
in
paris
the
sentiment
that
was
prevalent
in
the
time
of
ximenes
what
will
become
of
religion
if
the
study
of
greek
and
hebrew
be
permitted
the
prevalence
of
latin
was
the
condition
of
her
power
its
deterioration
the
measure
of
her
decay
its
disuse
the
signal
of
her
limitation
to
a
little
principality
in
italy
in
fact
the
development
of
european
languages
was
the
instrument
of
her
overthrow
they
formed
an
effectual
communication
between
the
mendicant
friars
and
the
illiterate
populace
and
there
was
not
one
of
them
that
did
not
display
in
its
earliest
productions
a
sovereign
contempt
for
her
the
rise
of
the
european
literature
was
therefore
coincident
with
the
decline
of
papal
christianity
european
literature
was
impossible
under
catholic
rule
a
grand
a
solemn
an
imposing
religious
unity
enforced
the
literary
unity
which
is
implied
in
the
use
of
a
single
tongue
while
thus
the
possession
of
a
universal
language
so
signally
secured
her
power
the
real
secret
of
much
of
the
influence
of
the
church
lay
in
the
control
she
had
so
skillfully
obtained
over
domestic
life
her
influence
diminished
as
that
declined
coincident
with
this
was
her
displacement
in
the
guidance
of
international
relations
by
diplomacy
catholicity
and
civilization
in
the
old
times
of
roman
domination
the
encampments
of
the
legions
in
the
provinces
had
always
proved
to
be
foci
of
civilization
the
industry
and
order
exhibited
in
them
presented
an
example
not
lost
on
the
surrounding
barbarians
of
britain
gaul
and
germany
and
though
it
was
no
part
of
their
duty
to
occupy
themselves
actively
in
the
betterment
of
the
conquered
tribes
but
rather
to
keep
them
in
a
depressed
condition
that
aided
in
maintaining
subjection
a
steady
improvement
both
in
the
individual
and
social
condition
took
place
under
the
ecclesiastical
domination
of
rome
similar
effects
occurred
in
the
open
country
the
monastery
replaced
the
legionary
encampment
in
the
village
or
town
the
church
was
a
centre
of
light
a
powerful
effect
was
produced
by
the
elegant
luxury
of
the
former
and
by
the
sacred
and
solemn
monitions
of
the
latter
in
extolling
the
papal
system
for
what
it
did
in
the
organization
of
the
family
the
definition
of
civil
policy
the
construction
of
the
states
of
europe
our
praise
must
be
limited
by
the
recollection
that
the
chief
object
of
ecclesiastical
policy
was
the
aggrandizement
of
the
church
not
the
promotion
of
civilization
the
benefit
obtained
by
the
laity
was
not
through
any
special
intention
but
incidental
or
collateral
there
was
no
no
persistent
plan
to
ameliorate
the
physical
condition
of
the
nations
nothing
was
done
to
favor
their
intellectual
development
indeed
on
the
contrary
it
was
the
settled
policy
to
keep
them
not
merely
illiterate
but
ignorant
century
after
century
passed
away
and
left
the
peasantry
but
little
better
than
the
cattle
in
the
fields
intercommunication
and
locomotion
which
tend
so
powerfully
to
expand
the
ideas
received
no
encouragement
the
majority
of
men
died
without
ever
having
ventured
out
of
the
neighborhood
in
which
they
were
born
for
them
there
was
no
hope
of
personal
improvement
none
of
the
bettering
of
their
lot
there
were
no
comprehensive
schemes
for
the
avoidance
of
individual
want
none
for
the
resistance
of
famines
pestilences
were
permitted
to
stalk
forth
unchecked
or
at
best
opposed
only
by
mummeries
bad
food
wretched
clothing
inadequate
shelter
were
suffered
to
produce
their
result
and
at
the
end
of
a
thousand
years
the
population
of
europe
had
not
doubled
if
policy
may
be
held
accountable
as
much
for
the
births
it
prevents
as
for
the
deaths
it
occasions
what
a
great
responsibility
there
is
here
in
this
investigation
of
the
influence
of
catholicism
we
must
carefully
keep
separate
what
it
did
for
the
people
and
what
it
did
for
itself
when
we
think
of
the
stately
monastery
an
embodiment
of
luxury
with
its
lawns
its
gardens
and
bowers
its
fountains
and
many
murmuring
streams
we
must
connect
it
not
with
the
peasant
dying
without
help
in
the
fens
but
with
the
abbot
his
ambling
palfrey
his
hawk
and
hounds
his
cellar
and
larder
he
is
part
of
a
system
that
has
its
centre
of
authority
in
to
that
his
allegiance
is
due
for
its
behoof
are
all
his
acts
when
we
survey
as
still
we
may
the
magnificent
churches
and
cathedrals
of
those
times
miracles
of
architectural
skill
the
only
real
miracles
of
catholicism
when
in
imagination
we
restore
the
transcendently
imposing
the
noble
services
of
which
they
were
once
the
scene
the
dim
streaming
in
through
the
windows
the
sounds
of
voices
not
inferior
in
their
melody
to
those
of
heaven
the
priests
in
their
sacred
vestments
and
above
all
the
prostrate
worshipers
listening
to
litanies
and
prayers
in
a
foreign
and
unknown
tongue
shall
we
not
ask
ourselves
was
all
this
for
the
sake
of
those
worshipers
or
for
the
glory
of
the
great
the
overshadowing
authority
at
rome
but
perhaps
some
one
may
say
are
there
not
limits
to
human
exertion
things
which
no
political
system
no
human
power
no
matter
how
excellent
its
intention
can
accomplish
men
can
not
be
raised
from
barbarism
a
continent
can
not
be
civilized
in
a
day
the
catholic
power
is
not
however
to
be
tried
by
any
such
standard
it
scornfully
rejected
and
still
rejects
a
human
origin
it
claims
to
be
accredited
supernaturally
the
sovereign
pontiff
is
the
vicar
of
god
upon
earth
infallible
in
judgment
it
is
given
to
him
to
accomplish
all
things
by
miracle
if
need
be
he
had
exercised
an
autocratic
tyranny
over
the
intellect
of
europe
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
and
though
on
some
occasions
he
had
encountered
the
resistances
of
disobedient
princes
these
in
the
aggregate
were
of
so
little
moment
that
the
physical
the
political
power
of
the
continent
may
be
affirmed
to
have
been
at
his
disposal
such
facts
as
have
been
presented
in
this
chapter
were
doubtless
well
weighed
by
the
protestant
reformers
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
brought
them
to
the
conclusion
that
catholicism
had
altogether
failed
in
its
mission
that
it
had
become
a
vast
system
of
delusion
and
imposture
and
that
a
restoration
of
true
christianity
could
only
be
accomplished
by
returning
to
the
faith
and
practices
of
the
primitive
times
this
was
no
decision
suddenly
arrived
at
it
had
long
been
the
opinion
of
many
religious
and
learned
men
the
pious
fratricelli
in
the
middle
ages
had
loudly
expressed
their
belief
that
the
fatal
gift
of
a
roman
emperor
had
been
the
doom
of
true
religion
it
wanted
nothing
more
than
the
voice
of
luther
to
bring
men
throughout
the
north
of
europe
to
the
determination
that
the
worship
of
the
virgin
mary
the
invocation
of
saints
the
working
of
miracles
supernatural
cures
of
the
sick
the
purchase
of
indulgences
for
the
perpetration
of
sin
and
all
other
evil
practices
lucrative
to
their
abettors
which
had
been
fastened
on
christianity
but
which
were
no
part
of
it
should
come
to
an
end
catholicism
as
a
system
for
promoting
the
of
man
had
plainly
failed
in
justifying
its
alleged
origin
its
performance
had
not
corresponded
to
its
great
pretensions
and
after
an
opportunity
of
more
than
a
thousand
years
duration
it
had
left
the
masses
of
men
submitted
to
its
influences

as

push
their
conquering
way
in
the
course
of

century
across

it
in
subjection
let
us
contrast
with
this
the
results
of
the
invasion
of
mexico
and
peru
by
the
spaniards
who
in
those
countries
overthrew
a
wonderful
civilization
in
many
respects
superior
to
their
own
a
civilization
that
had
been
accomplished
without
iron
and
gunpowder
a
civilization
resting
on
an
agriculture
that
had
neither
horse
nor
ox
nor
plough
the
spaniards
had
a
clear
base
to
start
from
and
no
obstruction
whatever
in
their
advance
they
ruined
all
that
the
aboriginal
children
of
america
had
accomplished
millions
of
those
unfortunates
were
destroyed
by
their
cruelty

that
for
many
centuries
had
been
living
in
contentment
and

shown
by
their
history
to
be

them

plunged
into
anarchy
the
people
fell
into

baneful
superstition

a
greater
part
of
their

and
other

found
its
way

i
have
selected
the
foregoing
illustration
drawn
from
american
history
in
preference
to
many
others
that
might
have
been
taken
from
european
because
it
furnishes
an
instance
of
the
operation
of
the
acting

least

european

progress
is
less
simple
than
american
quarrel
between
france
and
the
papacy
before
considering
its
manner
of
action
and
its
results
i
will
briefly
relate
how
the
scientific
principle
found
an
introduction
into
europe
introduction
of
science
into
europe
not
only
had
the
crusades
for
many
years
brought
vast
sums
to
rome
extorted
from
the
fears
or
the
piety
of
every
christian
nation
they
had
also
increased
the
papal
power
to
a
most
dangerous
extent
in
the
dual
governments
everywhere
prevailing
in
europe
the
spiritual
had
obtained
the
mastery
the
temporal
was
little
better
than
its
servant
from
all
quarters
and
under
all
kinds
of
pretenses
streams
of
money
were
steadily
flowing
into
italy
the
temporal
princes
found
that
there
were
left
for
them
inadequate
and
impoverished
revenues
philip
the
fair
king
of
france
not
only
determined
to
check
this
drain
from
his
dominions
by
prohibiting
the
export
of
gold
and
silver
without
his
license
he
also
resolved
that
the
clergy
and
the
ecclesiastical
estates
should
pay
their
share
of
taxes
to
him
this
brought
on
a
mortal
contest
with
the
papacy
the
king
was
excommunicated
and
in
retaliation
he
accused
the
pope
boniface
of
atheism
demanding
that
he
should
be
tried
by
a
general
council
he
sent
some
trusty
persons
into
italy
who
seized
boniface
in
his
palace
at
anagni
and
treated
him
with
so
much
severity
that
in
a
few
days
he
died
the
succeeding
pontiff
benedict
was
poisoned
the
french
king
was
determined
that
the
papacy
should
be
purified
and
reformed
that
it
should
no
longer
be
the
appanage
of
a
few
italian
families
who
were
dexterously
transmuting
the
credulity
of
europe
into
coin
that
french
influence
should
prevail
in
it
he
therefore
came
to
an
understanding
with
the
cardinals
a
french
archbishop
was
elevated
to
the
pontificate
he
took
the
name
of
clement
the
papal
court
was
removed
to
avignon
in
france
and
rome
was
abandoned
as
the
metropolis
of
christianity
moorish
science
introduced
through
france
seventy
years
elapsed
before
the
papacy
was
restored
to
the
eternal
city
the
diminution
of
its
influence
in
the
peninsula
that
had
thus
occurred
gave
opportunity
for
the
memorable
intellectual
movement
which
soon
manifested
itself
in
the
great
commercial
cities
of
upper
italy
contemporaneously
also
there
were
other
propitious
events
the
result
of
the
crusades
had
shaken
the
faith
of
all
christendom
in
an
age
when
the
test
of
the
ordeal
of
battle
was
universally
accepted
those
wars
had
ended
in
leaving
the
holy
land
in
the
hands
of
the
saracens
the
many
thousand
christian
warriors
who
had
returned
from
them
did
not
hesitate
to
declare
that
they
had
found
their
antagonists
not
such
as
had
been
pictured
by
the
church
but
valiant
courteous
just
through
the
gay
cities
of
the
south
of
france
a
love
of
romantic
literature
had
been
spreading
the
wandering
troubadours
had
been
singing
their
songs
songs
far
from
being
restricted
to
and
feats
of
war
often
their
burden
was
the
awful
atrocities
that
had
been
perpetrated
by
papal
authority
the
religious
massacres
of
languedoc
often
their
burden
was
the
illicit
amours
of
the
clergy
from
moorish
spain
the
gentle
and
gallant
idea
of
chivalry
had
been
brought
and
with
it
the
noble
sentiment
of
personal
honor
destined
in
the
course
of
time
to
give
a
code
of
its
own
to
europe
effect
of
the
great
schism
the
return
of
the
papacy
to
rome
was
far
from
restoring
the
influence
of
the
popes
over
the
italian
peninsula
more
than
two
generations
had
passed
away
since
their
departure
and
had
they
come
back
even
in
their
original
strength
they
could
not
have
resisted
the
intellectual
progress
that
had
been
made
during
their
absence
the
papacy
however
came
back
not
to
rule
but
to
be
divided
against
itself
to
encounter
the
great
schism
out
of
its
dissensions
emerged
two
rival
popes
eventually
there
were
three
each
pressing
his
claims
upon
the
religious
each
cursing
his
rival
a
sentiment
of
indignation
soon
spread
all
over
europe
a
determination
that
the
shameful
scenes
which
were
then
enacting
should
be
ended
how
could
the
dogma
of
a
vicar
of
god
upon
earth
the
dogma
of
an
infallible
pope
be
sustained
in
presence
of
such
scandals
herein
lay
the
cause
of
that
resolution
of
the
ablest
ecclesiastics
of
those
times
which
alas
for
europe
could
not
be
carried
into
effect
that
a
general
council
should
be
made
the
permanent
religious
parliament
of
the
whole
continent
with
the
pope
as
its
chief
executive
officer
had
that
intention
been
accomplished
there
would
have
been
at
this
day
no
conflict
between
science
and
religion
the
convulsion
of
the
reformation
would
have
been
avoided
there
would
have
been
no
jarring
protestant
sects
but
the
councils
of
constance
and
basle
failed
to
shake
off
the
italian
yoke
failed
to
attain
that
noble
result
catholicism
was
thus
weakening
as
its
leaden
pressure
lifted
the
intellect
of
man
expanded
the
saracens
had
invented
the
method
of
making
paper
from
linen
rags
and
from
cotton
the
venetians
had
brought
from
china
to
europe
the
art
of
printing
the
former
of
these
inventions
was
essential
to
the
latter
hence
forth
without
the
possibility
of
a
check
there
was
intellectual
intercommunication
among
all
men
invention
of
printing
the
invention
of
printing
was
a
severe
blow
to
catholicism
which
had
previously
enjoyed
the
inappreciable
advantage
of
a
monopoly
of
intercommunication
from
its
central
seat
orders
could
be
disseminated
through
all
the
ecclesiastical
ranks
and
fulminated
through
the
pulpits
this
monopoly
and
the
amazing
power
it
conferred
were
destroyed
by
the
press
in
modern
times
the
influence
of
the
pulpit
has
become
insignificant
the
pulpit
has
been
thoroughly
supplanted
by
the
newspaper
yet
catholicism
did
not
yield
its
ancient
advantage
without
a
struggle
as
soon
as
the
inevitable
tendency
of
the
new
art
was
detected
a
restraint
upon
it
under
the
form
of
a
censorship
was
attempted
it
was
made
necessary
to
have
a
permit
in
order
to
print
a
book
for
this
it
was
needful
that
the
work
should
have
been
read
examined
and
approved
by
the
clergy
there
must
be
a
certificate
that
it
was
a
godly
and
orthodox
book
a
bull
of
excommunication
was
issued
in
by
alexander
against
printers
who
should
publish
pernicious
doctrines
in
the
lateran
council
ordered
that
no
books
should
be
printed
but
such
as
had
been
inspected
by
the
ecclesiastical
censors
under
pain
of
excommunication
and
fine
the
censors
being
directed
to
take
the
utmost
care
that
nothing
should
be
printed
contrary
to
the
orthodox
faith
there
was
thus
a
dread
of
religious
discussion
a
terror
lest
truth
should
emerge
but
these
frantic
struggles
of
the
powers
of
ignorance
were
unavailing
intellectual
intercommunication
among
men
was
secured
it
culminated
in
the
modern
newspaper
which
daily
gives
its
contemporaneous
intelligence
from
all
parts
of
the
world
reading
became
a
common
occupation
in
ancient
society
that
art
was
possessed
by
comparatively
few
persons
modern
society
owes
some
of
its
most
striking
characteristics
to
this
change
effects
of
maritime
enterprise
such
was
the
result
of
bringing
into
europe
the
manufacture
of
paper
and
the
in
like
manner
the
introduction
of
the
mariner
compass
was
followed
by
imposing
material
and
moral
effects
these
were
the
discovery
of
america
in
consequence
of
the
rivalry
of
the
venetians
and
genoese
about
the
india
trade
the
doubling
of
africa
by
de
gama
and
the
circumnavigation
of
the
earth
by
magellan
with
respect
to
the
last
the
grandest
of
all
human
undertakings
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
catholicism
had
irrevocably
committed
itself
to
the
dogma
of
a
flat
earth
with
the
sky
as
the
floor
of
heaven
and
hell
in
the
some
of
the
fathers
whose
authority
was
held
to
be
paramount
had
as
we
have
previously
said
furnished
philosophical
and
religious
arguments
against
the
globular
form
the
controversy
had
now
suddenly
come
to
an
end
the
church
was
found
to
be
in
error
the
correction
of
that
geographical
error
was
by
no
means
the
only
important
result
that
followed
the
three
great
voyages
the
spirit
of
columbus
de
gama
magellan
diffused
itself
among
all
the
enterprising
men
of
western
europe
society
had
been
hitherto
living
under
the
dogma
of
loyalty
to
the
king
obedience
to
the
church
it
had
therefore
been
living
for
others
not
for
itself
the
political
effect
of
that
dogma
had
culminated
in
the
crusades
countless
thousands
had
perished
in
wars
that
could
bring
them
no
reward
and
of
which
the
result
had
been
conspicuous
failure
experience
had
revealed
the
fact
that
the
only
gainers
were
the
pontiffs
cardinals
and
other
ecclesiastics
in
rome
and
the
shipmasters
of
venice
but
when
it
became
known
that
the
wealth
of
mexico
peru
and
india
might
be
shared
by
any
one
who
had
enterprise
and
courage
the
motives
that
had
animated
the
restless
populations
of
europe
suddenly
changed
the
story
of
cortez
and
pizarro
found
enthusiastic
listeners
everywhere
maritime
adventure
supplanted
religious
enthusiasm
if
we
attempt
to
isolate
the
principle
that
lay
at
the
basis
of
the
wonderful
social
changes
that
now
took
place
we
may
recognize
it
without
difficulty
heretofore
each
man
had
dedicated
his
services
to
his
superior
feudal
or
ecclesiastical
now
he
had
resolved
to
gather
the
fruits
of
his
exertions
himself
individualism
was
becoming
predominant
loyalty
was
declining
into
a
sentiment
we
shall
now
see
how
it
was
with
the
church
individualism
individualism
rests
on
the
principle
that
a
man
shall
be
his
own
master
that
he
shall
have
liberty
to
form
his
own
opinions
freedom
to
carry
into
effect
his
resolves
he
is
therefore
ever
brought
into
competition
with
his
his
life
is
a
display
of
energy
to
remove
the
stagnation
of
centuries
front
european
life
to
vivify
suddenly
what
had
hitherto
been
an
inert
mass
to
impart
to
it
individualism
was
to
bring
it
into
conflict
with
the
influences
that
had
been
oppressing
it
all
through
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
uneasy
strugglings
gave
a
premonition
of
what
was
coming
in
the
early
part
of
the
sixteenth
the
battle
was
joined
individualism
found
its
embodiment
in
a
sturdy
german
monk
and
therefore
perhaps
necessarily
asserted
its
rights
under
theological
forms
there
were
some
preliminary
skirmishes
about
indulgences
and
other
minor
matters
but
very
soon
the
real
cause
of
dispute
came
plainly
into
view
martin
luther
refused
to
think
as
he
was
ordered
to
do
by
his
ecclesiastical
superiors
at
rome
he
asserted
that
he
had
an
inalienable
right
to
interpret
the
bible
for
himself
at
her
first
glance
rome
saw
nothing
in
martin
luther
but
a
vulgar
insubordinate
quarrelsome
monk
could
the
inquisition
have
laid
hold
of
him
it
would
have
speedily
disposed
of
his
affair
but
as
the
conflict
went
on
it
was
discovered
that
martin
was
not
standing
alone
many
thousands
of
men
as
resolute
as
himself
were
coming
up
to
his
support
and
while
he
carried
on
the
combat
with
writings
and
words
they
made
good
his
propositions
with
the
sword
the
reformation
the
vilification
which
was
poured
on
luther
and
his
doings
was
so
bitter
as
to
be
ludicrous
it
was
declared
that
his
father
was
not
his
mother
husband
but
an
impish
incubus
who
had
deluded
her
that
after
ten
years
struggling
with
his
conscience
he
had
become
an
atheist
that
he
denied
the
immortality
of
the
soul
that
he
had
composed
hymns
in
honor
of
drunkenness
a
vice
to
which
he
was
unceasingly
addicted
that
he
blasphemed
the
holy
scriptures
and
particularly
moses
that
he
did
not
believe
a
word
of
what
he
preached
that
he
had
called
the
epistle
of
james
a
thing
of
straw
and
above
all
that
the
reformation
was
no
work
of
his
but
in
reality
was
due
to
a
certain
astrological
position
of
the
stars
it
was
however
a
vulgar
saying
among
the
roman
ecclesiastics
that
erasmus
laid
the
egg
of
the
reformation
and
luther
hatched
it
rome
at
first
made
the
mistake
of
supposing
that
this
was
nothing
more
than
a
casual
outbreak
she
failed
to
discern
that
it
was
in
fact
the
culmination
of
an
internal
movement
which
for
two
centuries
had
been
going
on
in
europe
and
which
had
been
hourly
gathering
force
that
had
there
been
nothing
else
the
existence
of
three
popes
three
obediences
would
have
compelled
men
to
think
to
deliberate
to
conclude
for
themselves
the
councils
of
constance
and
basle
taught
them
that
there
was
a
higher
power
than
the
popes
the
long
and
bloody
wars
that
ensued
were
closed
by
the
peace
of
westphalia
and
then
it
was
found
that
central
and
northern
europe
had
cast
off
the
intellectual
tyranny
of
rome
that
individualism
had
carried
its
point
and
had
established
the
right
of
every
man
to
think
for
himself
decomposition
of
protestantism
but
it
was
impossible
that
the
establishment
of
this
right
of
private
judgment
should
end
with
the
rejection
of
catholicism
early
in
the
movement
some
of
the
most
distinguished
men
such
as
erasmus
who
had
been
among
its
first
promoters
abandoned
it
they
perceived
that
many
of
the
reformers
entertained
a
bitter
dislike
of
learning
and
they
were
afraid
of
being
brought
under
bigoted
caprice
the
protestant
party
having
thus
established
its
existence
by
dissent
and
separation
must
in
its
turn
submit
to
the
operation
of
the
same
principles
a
decomposition
into
many
subordinate
sects
was
inevitable
and
these
now
that
they
had
no
longer
any
thing
to
fear
from
their
great
italian
adversary
commenced
partisan
warfares
on
each
other
as
in
different
countries
first
one
and
then
another
sect
rose
to
power
it
stained
itself
with
cruelties
perpetrated
upon
its
competitors
the
mortal
retaliations
that
had
ensued
when
in
the
chances
of
the
times
the
oppressed
got
the
better
of
their
oppressors
convinced
the
contending
sectarians
that
they
must
concede
to
their
competitors
what
they
claimed
for
themselves
and
thus
from
their
broils
and
their
crimes
the
great
principle
of
toleration
extricated
itself
but
toleration
is
only
an
intermediate
stage
and
as
the
intellectual
decomposition
of
protestantism
keeps
going
on
that
transitional
condition
will
lead
to
a
higher
and
nobler
state
the
hope
of
philosophy
in
all
past
ages
of
the
world
a
social
state
in
which
there
shall
be
unfettered
freedom
for
thought
toleration
except
when
extorted
by
fear
can
only
come
from
those
who
are
capable
of
entertaining
and
respecting
other
opinions
than
their
own
it
can
therefore
only
come
from
philosophy
history
teaches
us
only
too
plainly
that
fanaticism
is
stimulated
by
religion
and
neutralized
or
eradicated
by
philosophy
toleration
the
avowed
object
of
the
reformation
was
to
remove
from
christianity
the
pagan
ideas
and
pagan
rites
engrafted
upon
it
by
constantine
and
his
successors
in
their
attempt
to
reconcile
the
roman
empire
to
it
the
protestants
designed
to
bring
it
back
to
its
primitive
purity
and
hence
while
restoring
the
ancient
doctrines
they
cast
out
of
it
all
such
practices
as
the
adoration
of
the
virgin
mary
and
the
invocation
of
saints
the
virgin
mary
we
are
assured
by
the
evangelists
had
accepted
the
duties
of
married
life
and
borne
to
her
husband
several
children
in
the
prevailing
idolatry
she
had
ceased
to
be
regarded
as
the
carpenter
wife
she
had
become
the
queen
of
heaven
and
the
mother
of
god
da
vinci
the
science
of
the
arabians
followed
the
invading
track
of
their
literature
which
had
come
into
christendom
by
two
routes
the
south
of
france
and
sicily
favored
by
the
exile
of
the
popes
to
avignon
and
by
the
great
schism
it
made
good
its
foothold
in
upper
italy
the
aristotelian
or
inductive
philosophy
clad
in
the
saracenic
costume
that
averroes
had
given
it
made
many
secret
and
not
a
few
open
friends
it
found
many
minds
eager
to
receive
and
able
to
appreciate
it
among
these
were
leonardo
da
vinci
who
proclaimed
the
fundamental
principle
that
experiment
and
observation
are
the
only
reliable
foundations
of
reasoning
in
science
that
experiment
is
the
only
trustworthy
interpreter
of
nature
and
is
essential
to
the
ascertainment
of
laws
he
showed
that
the
action
of
two
perpendicular
forces
upon
a
point
is
the
same
as
that
denoted
by
the
diagonal
of
a
rectangle
of
which
they
represent
the
sides
from
this
the
passage
to
the
proposition
of
oblique
forces
was
very
easy
this
proposition
was
rediscovered
by
stevinus
a
century
later
and
applied
by
him
to
the
explanation
of
the
mechanical
powers
da
vinci
gave
a
clear
exposition
of
the
theory
of
forces
applied
obliquely
on
a
lever
discovered
the
laws
of
friction
subsequently
demonstrated
by
amontons
and
understood
the
principle
of
virtual
velocities
he
treated
of
the
conditions
of
descent
of
bodies
along
inclined
planes
and
circular
arcs
invented
the
discussed
correctly
several
physiological
problems
and
foreshadowed
some
of
the
great
conclusions
of
modern
geology
such
as
the
nature
of
fossil
remains
and
the
elevation
of
continents
he
explained
the
reflected
by
the
moon
with
surprising
versatility
of
genius
he
excelled
as
a
sculptor
architect
engineer
was
thoroughly
versed
in
the
astronomy
anatomy
and
chemistry
of
his
times
in
painting
he
was
the
rival
of
michel
angelo
in
a
competition
between
them
he
was
considered
to
have
established
his
superiority
his
last
supper
on
the
wall
of
the
refectory
of
the
dominican
convent
of
sta
maria
delle
grazie
is
well
known
from
the
numerous
engravings
and
copies
that
have
been
made
of
it
italian
scientific
societies
once
firmly
established
in
the
north
of
italy
science
soon
extended
her
sway
over
the
entire
peninsula
the
increasing
number
of
her
devotees
is
indicated
by
the
rise
and
rapid
multiplication
of
learned
societies
these
were
reproductions
of
the
moorish
ones
that
had
formerly
existed
in
granada
and
cordova
as
if
to
mark
by
a
monument
the
track
through
which
civilizing
influences
had
come
the
academy
of
toulouse
founded
in
has
survived
to
our
own
times
it
represented
however
the
gay
literature
of
the
south
of
france
and
was
known
under
the
fanciful
title
of
the
academy
of
floral
games
the
first
society
for
the
promotion
of
physical
science
the
academia
secretorum
naturae
was
founded
at
naples
by
baptista
porta
it
was
as
tiraboschi
relates
dissolved
by
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
the
lyncean
was
founded
by
prince
frederic
cesi
at
rome
its
device
plainly
indicated
its
intention
a
lynx
with
its
eyes
turned
upward
toward
heaven
tearing
a
cerberus
with
its
claws
the
accademia
del
cimento
established
at
florence
held
its
meetings
in
the
ducal
palace
it
lasted
ten
years
and
was
then
suppressed
at
the
instance
of
the
papal
government
as
an
equivalent
the
brother
of
the
was
made
a
cardinal
it
numbered
many
great
men
such
as
torricelli
and
castelli
among
its
members
the
condition
of
admission
into
it
was
an
abjuration
of
all
faith
and
a
resolution
to
inquire
into
the
truth
these
societies
extricated
the
cultivators
of
science
from
the
isolation
in
which
they
had
hitherto
lived
and
by
promoting
their
intercommunication
and
union
imparted
activity
and
strength
to
them
all
returning
now
from
this
digression
this
historical
sketch
of
the
circumstances
under
which
science
was
introduced
into
europe
i
pass
to
the
consideration
of
its
manner
of
action
and
its
results
intellectual
influence
of
science
the
influence
of
science
on
modern
civilization
has
been
twofold
intellectual
economical
under
these
titles
we
may
conveniently
consider
it
intellectually
it
overthrew
the
authority
of
tradition
it
refused
to
accept
unless
accompanied
by
proof
the
dicta
of
any
master
no
matter
how
eminent
or
honored
his
name
the
conditions
of
admission
into
the
italian
accademia
del
cimento
and
the
motto
adopted
by
the
royal
society
of
london
illustrate
the
position
it
took
in
this
respect
it
rejected
the
supernatural
and
miraculous
as
evidence
in
physical
discussions
it
abandoned
such
as
the
jews
in
old
days
required
and
denied
that
a
demonstration
can
be
given
through
an
illustration
of
something
else
thus
casting
aside
the
logic
that
had
been
in
vogue
for
many
centuries
in
physical
inquiries
its
mode
of
procedure
was
to
test
the
value
of
any
proposed
hypothesis
by
executing
computations
in
any
special
case
on
the
basis
or
principle
of
that
hypothesis
and
then
by
performing
an
experiment
or
making
an
observation
to
ascertain
whether
the
result
of
these
agreed
with
the
result
of
the
computation
if
it
did
not
the
hypothesis
was
to
be
rejected
we
may
here
introduce
an
illustration
or
two
of
this
mode
of
procedure
theories
of
gravitation
and
phlogiston
newton
suspecting
that
the
influence
of
the
earth
attraction
gravity
may
extend
as
far
as
the
moon
and
be
the
force
that
causes
her
to
revolve
in
her
orbit
round
the
earth
calculated
that
by
her
motion
in
her
orbit
she
was
deflected
from
the
tangent
thirteen
feet
every
minute
but
by
ascertaining
the
space
through
which
bodies
would
fall
in
one
minute
at
the
surface
and
supposing
it
to
be
diminished
in
the
ratio
of
the
inverse
square
it
appeared
that
the
attraction
at
the
moon
orbit
would
draw
a
body
through
more
than
fifteen
feet
he
therefore
for
the
time
considered
his
hypothesis
as
unsustained
but
it
so
happened
that
picard
shortly
afterward
executed
more
correctly
a
new
measurement
of
a
degree
this
changed
the
estimated
magnitude
of
the
earth
and
the
distance
of
the
moon
which
was
measured
in
newton
now
renewed
his
computation
and
as
i
have
related
on
a
previous
page
as
it
drew
to
a
close
foreseeing
that
a
coincidence
was
about
to
be
established
was
so
much
agitated
that
he
was
obliged
to
ask
a
friend
to
complete
it
the
hypothesis
was
sustained
a
second
instance
will
sufficiently
illustrate
the
method
under
consideration
it
is
presented
by
the
chemical
theory
of
phlogiston
stahl
the
author
of
this
theory
asserted
that
there
is
a
principle
of
inflammability
to
which
he
gave
the
name
phlogiston
having
the
quality
of
uniting
with
substances
thus
when
what
we
now
term
a
metallic
oxide
was
united
to
it
a
metal
was
produced
and
if
the
phlogiston
were
withdrawn
the
metal
passed
back
into
its
earthy
or
oxidized
state
on
this
principle
then
the
metals
were
compound
bodies
earths
combined
with
phlogiston
science
and
ecclesiasticism
but
during
the
eighteenth
century
the
balance
was
introduced
as
an
instrument
of
chemical
research
now
if
the
phlogistic
hypothesis
be
true
it
would
follow
that
a
metal
should
be
the
heavier
its
oxide
the
lighter
body
for
the
former
contains
something
phlogiston
that
has
been
added
to
the
latter
but
on
weighing
a
portion
of
any
metal
and
also
the
oxide
producible
from
it
the
latter
proves
to
be
the
heavier
and
here
the
phlogistic
hypothesis
fails
still
further
on
continuing
the
investigation
it
may
be
shown
that
the
oxide
or
calx
as
it
used
to
be
called
has
become
heavier
by
combining
with
one
of
the
ingredients
of
the
air
to
lavoisier
is
usually
attributed
this
test
experiment
but
the
fact
that
the
weight
of
a
metal
increases
by
calcination
was
established
by
earlier
european
experimenters
and
indeed
was
well
known
to
the
arabian
chemists
lavoisier
however
was
the
first
to
recognize
its
great
importance
in
his
hands
it
produced
a
revolution
in
chemistry
the
abandonment
of
the
phlogistic
theory
is
an
illustration
of
the
readiness
with
which
scientific
hypotheses
are
surrendered
when
found
to
be
wanting
in
accordance
with
facts
authority
and
tradition
pass
for
nothing
every
thing
is
settled
by
an
appeal
to
nature
it
is
assumed
that
the
answers
she
gives
to
a
practical
interrogation
will
ever
be
true
comparing
now
the
philosophical
principles
on
which
science
was
proceeding
with
the
principles
on
which
ecclesiasticism
rested
we
see
that
while
the
former
repudiated
tradition
to
the
latter
it
was
the
main
support
while
the
former
insisted
on
the
agreement
of
calculation
and
observation
or
the
correspondence
of
reasoning
and
fact
the
latter
leaned
upon
mysteries
while
the
former
summarily
rejected
its
own
theories
if
it
saw
that
they
could
not
be
coordinated
with
nature
the
latter
found
merit
in
a
faith
that
blindly
accepted
the
inexplicable
a
satisfied
contemplation
of
things
above
reason
the
alienation
between
the
two
continually
increased
on
one
side
there
was
a
sentiment
of
disdain
on
the
other
a
sentiment
of
hatred
impartial
witnesses
on
all
hands
perceived
that
science
was
rapidly
undermining
ecclesiasticism
mathematics
mathematics
had
thus
become
the
great
instrument
of
scientific
research
it
had
become
the
instrument
of
scientific
reasoning
in
one
respect
it
may
be
said
that
it
reduced
the
operations
of
the
mind
to
a
mechanical
process
for
its
symbols
often
saved
the
labor
of
thinking
the
habit
of
mental
exactness
it
encouraged
extended
to
other
branches
of
thought
and
produced
an
intellectual
revolution
no
longer
was
it
possible
to
be
satisfied
with
or
the
logic
that
had
been
relied
upon
throughout
the
middle
ages
not
only
did
it
thus
influence
the
manner
of
thinking
it
also
changed
the
direction
of
thought
of
this
we
may
be
satisfied
by
comparing
the
subjects
considered
in
the
transactions
of
the
various
learned
societies
with
the
discussions
that
had
occupied
the
attention
of
the
middle
ages
but
the
use
of
mathematics
was
not
limited
to
the
verification
of
theories
as
above
indicated
it
also
furnished
a
means
of
predicting
what
had
hitherto
been
unobserved
in
this
it
offered
a
counterpart
to
the
prophecies
of
ecclesiasticism
the
discovery
of
neptune
is
an
instance
of
the
kind
furnished
by
astronomy
and
that
of
conical
refraction
by
the
optical
theory
of
undulations
but
while
this
great
instrument
led
to
such
a
wonderful
development
in
natural
science
it
was
itself
undergoing
development
improvement
let
us
in
a
few
lines
recall
its
progress
the
germ
of
algebra
may
be
discerned
in
the
works
of
diophantus
of
alexandria
who
is
supposed
to
have
lived
in
the
second
century
of
our
era
in
that
egyptian
school
euclid
had
formerly
collected
the
great
truths
of
geometry
and
arranged
them
in
logical
sequence
archimedes
in
syracuse
had
attempted
the
solution
of
the
higher
problems
by
the
method
of
exhaustions
such
was
the
tendency
of
things
that
had
the
patronage
of
science
been
continued
algebra
would
inevitably
have
been
invented
to
the
arabians
we
owe
our
knowledge
of
the
rudiments
of
algebra
we
owe
to
them
the
very
name
under
which
this
branch
of
mathematics
passes
they
had
carefully
added
to
the
remains
of
the
alexandrian
school
improvements
obtained
in
india
and
had
communicated
to
the
subject
a
certain
consistency
and
form
the
knowledge
of
algebra
as
they
possessed
it
was
first
brought
into
italy
about
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
it
attracted
so
little
attention
that
nearly
three
hundred
years
elapsed
before
any
european
work
on
the
subject
appeared
in
paccioli
published
his
book
entitled
arte
maggiore
or
alghebra
in
cardan
of
milan
gave
a
method
for
the
solution
of
cubic
equations
other
improvements
were
contributed
by
scipio
ferreo
by
tartalea
by
vieta
the
germans
now
took
up
the
subject
at
this
time
the
notation
was
in
an
imperfect
state
the
publication
of
the
geometry
of
descartes
which
contains
the
application
of
algebra
to
the
definition
and
investigation
of
curve
lines
constitutes
an
epoch
in
the
history
of
the
mathematical
sciences
two
years
previously
cavalieri
work
on
indivisibles
had
appeared
this
method
was
improved
by
torricelli
and
others
the
way
was
now
open
for
the
development
of
the
infinitesimal
calculus
the
method
of
fluxions
of
newton
and
the
differential
and
integral
calculus
of
leibnitz
though
in
his
possession
many
years
previously
newton
published
nothing
on
fluxions
until
the
imperfect
notation
he
employed
retarded
very
much
the
application
of
his
method
meantime
on
the
continent
very
largely
through
the
brilliant
solutions
of
some
of
the
higher
problems
accomplished
by
the
bernouillis
the
calculus
of
leibnitz
was
universally
accepted
and
improved
by
many
mathematicians
an
extraordinary
development
of
the
science
now
took
place
and
continued
throughout
the
century
to
the
binomial
theorem
previously
discovered
by
newton
taylor
now
added
in
his
method
of
increments
the
celebrated
theorem
that
bears
his
name
this
was
in
the
calculus
of
partial
differences
was
introduced
by
euler
in
it
was
extended
by
and
was
followed
by
that
of
variations
by
euler
and
lagrange
and
by
the
method
of
derivative
functions
by
lagrange
in
but
it
was
not
only
in
italy
in
germany
in
england
in
france
that
this
great
movement
in
mathematics
was
witnessed
scotland
had
added
a
new
gem
to
the
intellectual
diadem
with
which
her
brow
is
encircled
by
the
grand
invention
of
logarithms
by
napier
of
merchiston
it
is
impossible
to
give
any
adequate
conception
of
the
scientific
importance
of
this
incomparable
invention
the
modern
physicist
and
astronomer
will
most
cordially
agree
with
briggs
the
professor
of
mathematics
in
gresham
college
in
his
exclamation
i
never
saw
a
book
that
pleased
me
better
and
that
made
i
me
more
wonder
not
without
reason
did
the
immortal
kepler
regard
napier
to
be
the
greatest
man
of
his
age
in
the
department
to
which
he
had
applied
his
abilities
napier
died
in
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
this
invention
by
shortening
the
labors
doubled
the
life
of
the
astronomer
but
here
i
must
check
myself
i
must
remember
that
my
present
purpose
is
not
to
give
the
history
of
mathematics
but
to
consider
what
science
has
done
for
the
advancement
of
human
civilization
and
now
at
once
recurs
the
question
how
is
it
that
the
church
produced
no
geometer
in
her
autocratic
reign
of
twelve
hundred
years
with
respect
to
pure
mathematics
this
remark
may
be
made
its
cultivation
does
not
demand
appliances
that
are
beyond
the
reach
of
most
individuals
astronomy
must
have
its
observatory
chemistry
its
laboratory
but
mathematics
asks
only
personal
disposition
and
a
few
books
no
great
expenditures
are
called
for
nor
the
services
of
assistants
one
would
think
that
nothing
could
be
more
congenial
nothing
more
delightful
even
in
the
retirement
of
monastic
life
shall
we
answer
with
eusebius
it
is
through
contempt
of
such
useless
labor
that
we
think
so
little
of
these
matters
we
turn
our
souls
to
the
exercise
of
better
things
better
things
what
can
be
better
than
absolute
truth
are
mysteries
miracles
lying
impostures
better
it
was
these
that
stood
in
the
way
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
had
recognized
from
the
outset
of
this
scientific
invasion
that
the
principles
it
was
disseminating
were
absolutely
irreconcilable
with
the
current
theology
directly
and
indirectly
they
struggled
against
it
so
great
was
their
detestation
of
experimental
science
that
they
thought
they
had
gained
a
great
advantage
when
the
accademia
del
cimento
was
suppressed
nor
was
the
sentiment
restricted
to
catholicism
when
the
royal
society
of
london
was
founded
theological
odium
was
directed
against
it
with
so
much
rancor
that
doubtless
it
would
have
been
extinguished
had
not
king
charles
ii
given
it
his
open
and
avowed
support
it
was
accused
of
an
intention
of
destroying
the
established
religion
of
injuring
the
universities
and
of
upsetting
ancient
and
solid
learning
the
royal
society
of
london
we
have
only
to
turn
over
the
pages
of
its
transactions
to
discern
how
much
this
society
has
done
for
the
progress
of
humanity
it
was
incorporated
in
and
has
interested
itself
in
all
the
great
scientific
movements
and
discoveries
that
have
since
been
made
it
published
newton
principia
it
promoted
halley
voyage
the
first
scientific
expedition
undertaken
by
any
government
it
made
experiments
on
the
transfusion
of
blood
and
accepted
harvey
discovery
of
the
circulation
the
encouragement
it
gave
to
inoculation
led
queen
caroline
to
beg
six
condemned
criminals
for
experiment
and
then
to
submit
her
own
children
to
that
operation
through
its
encouragement
bradley
accomplished
his
great
discovery
the
aberration
of
the
fixed
stars
and
that
of
the
nutation
of
the
earth
axis
to
these
two
discoveries
delambre
says
we
owe
the
exactness
of
modern
astronomy
it
promoted
the
improvement
of
the
thermometer
the
measure
of
temperature
and
in
harrison
watch
the
chronometer
the
measure
of
time
through
it
the
gregorian
calendar
was
introduced
into
england
in
against
a
violent
religious
opposition
some
of
its
fellows
were
pursued
through
the
streets
by
an
ignorant
and
infuriated
mob
who
believed
it
had
robbed
them
of
eleven
days
of
their
lives
it
was
found
necessary
to
conceal
the
name
of
father
walmesley
a
learned
jesuit
who
had
taken
deep
interest
in
the
matter
and
bradley
happening
to
die
during
the
commotion
it
was
declared
that
he
had
suffered
a
judgment
from
heaven
for
his
crime
the
royal
society
of
london
if
i
were
to
attempt
to
do
justice
to
the
merits
of
this
great
society
i
should
have
to
devote
many
pages
to
such
subjects
as
the
achromatic
telescope
of
dollond
the
dividing
engine
of
ramsden
which
first
gave
precision
to
astronomical
observations
the
measurement
of
a
degree
on
the
earth
surface
by
mason
and
dixon
the
expeditions
of
cook
in
connection
with
the
transit
of
venus
his
circumnavigation
of
the
earth
his
proof
that
scurvy
the
curse
of
long
may
be
avoided
by
the
use
of
vegetable
substances
the
polar
expeditions
the
determination
of
the
density
of
the
earth
by
maskelyne
experiments
at
scheliallion
and
by
those
of
cavendish
the
discovery
of
the
planet
uranus
by

the
composition
of

by
cavendish
and
watt
the
determination
of
the

the
invention
of
the
voltaic
pile
the

of
the

instance
of
humboldt
for
the
establishment
of
many
magnetic
observatories
the
verification
of
contemporaneous
magnetic
disturbances
over
the
earth
surface
but
it
is
impossible
in
the
limited
space
at
my
disposal
to
give
even
so
little
as
a
catalogue
of
its
transactions
its
spirit
was
identical
with
that
which
animated
the
accademia
del
cimento
and
its
motto
accordingly
was
nullius
in
verba
it
proscribed
superstition
and
permitted
only
calculation
observation
and
experiment
influence
of
science
not
for
a
moment
must
it
be
supposed
that
in
these
great
attempts
these
great
successes
the
royal
society
stood
alone
in
all
the
capitals
of
europe
there
were
academies
institutes
or
societies
equal
in
distinction
and
equally
successful
in
promoting
human
knowledge
and
modern
civilization
the
economical
influences
of
science
the
scientific
study
of
nature
tends
not
only
to
correct
and
ennoble
the
intellectual
conceptions
of
man
it
serves
also
to
ameliorate
his
physical
condition
it
perpetually
suggests
to
him
the
inquiry
how
he
may
make
by
their
economical
application
ascertained
facts
subservient
to
his
use
the
investigation
of
principles
is
quickly
followed
by
practical
inventions
this
indeed
is
the
characteristic
feature
of
our
times
it
has
produced
a
great
revolution
in
national
policy
in
former
ages
wars
were
made
for
the
procuring
of
slaves
a
conqueror
transported
entire
populations
and
extorted
from
them
forced
labor
for
it
was
only
by
human
labor
that
human
labor
could
be
relieved
but
when
it
was
discovered
that
physical
agents
and
mechanical
combinations
could
be
employed
to
incomparably
greater
advantage
public
policy
underwent
a
change
when
it
was
recognized
that
the
application
of
a
new
principle
or
the
invention
of
a
new
machine
was
better
than
the
acquisition
of
an
additional
slave
peace
became
preferable
to
war
and
not
only
so
but
nations
possessing
great
slave
or
serf
populations
as
was
the
care
in
america
and
russia
found
that
considerations
of
humanity
were
supported
by
considerations
of
interest
and
set
their
bondmen
free
scientific
inventions
thus
we
live
in
a
period
of
which
a
characteristic
is
the
supplanting
of
human
and
animal
labor
by
machines
its
mechanical
inventions
have
wrought
a
social
revolution
we
appeal
to
the
natural
not
to
the
supernatural
for
the
accomplishment
of
our
ends
it
is
with
the
modern
civilization
thus
arising
that
catholicism
refuses
to
be
reconciled
the
papacy
loudly
proclaims
its
inflexible
repudiation
of
this
state
of
affairs
and
insists
on
a
restoration
of
the
medieval
condition
of
things
that
a
piece
of
amber
when
rubbed
will
attract
and
then
repel
light
bodies
was
a
fact
known
six
hundred
years
before
christ
it
remained
an
isolated
uncultivated
fact
a
mere
trifle
until
sixteen
hundred
years
after
christ
then
dealt
with
by
the
scientific
methods
of
mathematical
discussion
and
experiment
and
practical
application
made
of
the
result
it
has
permitted
men
to
communicate
instantaneously
with
each
other
across
continents
and
under
oceans
it
has
centralized
the
world
by
enabling
the
sovereign
authority
to
transmit
its
mandates
without
regard
to
distance
or
to
time
it
has
revolutionized
statesmanship
and
condensed
political
power
in
the
museum
of
alexandria
there
was
a
machine
invented
by
hero
the
mathematician
a
little
more
than
one
hundred
years
before
christ
it
revolved
by
the
agency
of
steam
and
was
of
the
form
that
we
should
now
call
a
this
the
germ
of
one
of
the
most
important
inventions
ever
made
was
remembered
as
a
mere
curiosity
for
seventeen
hundred
years
chance
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
invention
of
the
modern
it
was
the
product
of
meditation
and
experiment
in
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
several
mechanical
engineers
attempted
to
utilize
the
properties
of
steam
their
labors
were
brought
to
perfection
by
watt
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
the
quickly
became
the
drudge
of
civilization
it
performed
the
work
of
many
millions
of
men
it
gave
to
those
who
would
have
been
condemned
to
a
life
of
brutal
toil
the
opportunity
of
better
pursuits
he
who
formerly
labored
might
now
think
its
earliest
application
was
in
such
operations
as
pumping
wherein
mere
force
is
required
soon
however
it
vindicated
its
delicacy
of
touch
in
the
industrial
arts
of
spinning
and
weaving
it
created
vast
manufacturing
establishments
and
supplied
clothing
for
the
world
it
changed
the
industry
of
nations
in
its
application
first
to
the
navigation
of
rivers
and
then
to
the
navigation
of
the
ocean
it
more
than
quadrupled
the
speed
that
had
heretofore
been
attained
instead
of
forty
days
being
requisite
for
the
passage
the
atlantic
might
now
be
crossed
in
eight
but
in
land
transportation
its
power
was
most
strikingly
displayed
the
admirable
invention
of
the
locomotive
enabled
men
to
travel
farther
in
less
than
an
hour
than
they
formerly
could
have
done
in
more
than
a
day
the
locomotive
has
not
only
enlarged
the
field
of
human
activity
but
by
diminishing
space
it
has
increased
the
capabilities
of
human
life
in
the
swift
transportation
of
manufactured
goods
and
agricultural
products
it
has
become
a
most
efficient
incentive
to
human
industry
the
perfection
of
ocean
was
greatly
promoted
by
the
invention
of
the
chronometer
which
rendered
it
possible
to
find
with
accuracy
the
place
of
a
ship
at
sea
the
great
drawback
on
the
advancement
of
science
in
the
alexandrian
school
was
the
want
of
an
instrument
for
the
measurement
of
time
and
one
for
the
measurement
of
temperature
the
chronometer
and
the
thermometer
indeed
the
invention
of
the
latter
is
essential
to
that
of
the
former
clepsydras
or
had
been
tried
but
they
were
deficient
in
accuracy
of
one
of
them
ornamented
with
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
and
destroyed
by
certain
primitive
christians
polycarp
significantly
remarked
in
all
these
monstrous
demons
is
seen
an
art
hostile
to
god
not
until
about
did
the
chronometer
begin
to
approach
accuracy
hooke
the
contemporary
of
newton
gave
it
the
with
the
spiral
spring
and
various
escapements
in
succession
were
devised
such
as
the
anchor
the
the
duplex
the
remontoir
provisions
for
the
variation
of
temperature
were
introduced
it
was
brought
to
perfection
eventually
by
harrison
and
arnold
in
their
hands
becoming
an
accurate
measure
of
the
flight
of
time
to
the
invention
of
the
chronometer
must
be
added
that
of
the
reflecting
sextant
by
godfrey
this
permitted
astronomical
observations
to
be
made
notwithstanding
the
motion
of
a
ship
improvements
in
ocean
navigation
are
exercising
a
powerful
influence
on
the
distribution
of
mankind
they
are
increasing
the
amount
and
altering
the
character
of
colonization
domestic
improvement
but
not
alone
have
these
great
discoveries
and
inventions
the
offspring
of
scientific
investigation
changed
the
lot
of
the
human
race
very
many
minor
ones
perhaps
individually
insignificant
have
in
their
aggregate
accomplished
surprising
effects
the
commencing
cultivation
of
science
in
the
fourteenth
century
gave
a
wonderful
stimulus
to
inventive
talent
directed
mainly
to
useful
practical
results
and
this
subsequently
was
greatly
encouraged
by
the
system
of
patents
which
secure
to
the
originator
a
reasonable
portion
of
the
benefits
of
his
skill
it
is
sufficient
to
refer
in
the
most
cursory
manner
to
a
few
of
these
improvements
we
appreciate
at
once
how
much
they
have
done
the
introduction
of
the
gave
wooden
floors
to
houses
banishing
those
of
gypsum
tile
or
stone
improvements
cheapening
the
manufacture
of
glass
gave
windows
making
possible
the
warming
of
apartments
however
it
was
not
until
the
sixteenth
century
that
glazing
could
be
well
done
the
cutting
of
glass
by
the
diamond
was
then
introduced
the
addition
of
chimneys
purified
the
atmosphere
of
dwellings
smoky
and
sooty
as
the
huts
of
savages
it
gave
that
indescribable
blessing
of
northern
homes
a
cheerful
fireside
hitherto
a
hole
in
the
roof
for
the
escape
of
the
smoke
a
pit
in
the
midst
of
the
floor
to
contain
the
fuel
and
to
be
covered
with
a
lid
when
the
sounded
or
night
came
such
had
been
the
cheerless
and
inadequate
means
of
warming
municipal
improvements
though
not
without
a
bitter
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
clergy
men
began
to
think
that
pestilences
are
not
punishments
inflicted
by
god
on
society
for
its
religious
shortcomings
but
the
physical
consequences
of
filth
and
wretchedness
that
the
proper
mode
of
avoiding
them
is
not
by
praying
to
the
saints
but
by
insuring
personal
and
municipal
cleanliness
in
the
twelfth
century
it
was
found
necessary
to
pave
the
streets
of
paris
the
stench
in
them
was
so
dreadful
at
once
dysenteries
and
spotted
fever
diminished
a
sanitary
condition
approaching
that
of
the
moorish
cities
of
spain
which
had
been
paved
for
centuries
was
attained
in
that
now
beautiful
metropolis
it
was
forbidden
to
keep
swine
an
ordinance
resented
by
the
monks
of
the
abbey
of
anthony
who
demanded
that
the
pigs
of
that
saint
should
go
where
they
chose
the
government
was
obliged
to
compromise
the
matter
by
requiring
that
bells
should
be
fastened
to
the
animals
necks
king
philip
the
son
of
louis
the
fat

been
killed
by
his

stumbling
over
a
sow
prohibitions
were
published
against
throwing
slops
out
of
the
windows
in
an
the
author
of
this
book
at
the
close
of
the
pontifical
rule
in
rome
found
that
in
walking
the
streets
of
that
city
it
was
more
necessary
to
inspect
the
earth
than
to
contemplate
the
heavens
in
order
to
preserve
personal
purity
until
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
streets
of
berlin
were
never
swept
there
was
a
law
that
every
countryman
who
came
to
market
with
a
cart
should
carry
back
a
load
of
dirt
paving
was
followed
by
attempts
often
of
an
imperfect
kind
at
the
construction
of
drains
and
sewers
it
had
become
obvious
to
all
reflecting
men
that
these
were
necessary
to
the
preservation
of
health
not
only
in
towns
but
in
isolated
houses
then
followed
the
lighting
of
the
public
thoroughfares
at
first
houses
facing
the
streets
were
compelled
to
have
candles
or
lamps
in
their
windows
next
the
system
that
had
been
followed
with
so
much
advantage
in
cordova
and
granada
of
having
public
lamps
was
tried
but
this
was
not
brought
to
perfection
until
the
present
century
when
lighting
by
gas
was
invented
contemporaneously
with
public
lamps
were
improved
organizations
for
and
police
by
the
sixteenth
century
mechanical
inventions
and
manufacturing
improvements
were
exercising
a
conspicuous
influence
on
domestic
and
social
life
there
were
and
clocks
on
the
walls
mantels
over
the
fireplaces
though
in
many
districts
the
was
still
supplied
with
turf
the
use
of
coal
began
to
prevail
the
table
in
the
offered
new
delicacies
commerce
was
bringing
to
it
foreign
products
the
coarse
drinks
of
the
north
were
supplanted
by
the
delicate
wines
of
the
south
were
constructed
the
bolting
of
flour
introduced
at
the
windmills
had
given
whiter
and
finer
bread
by
degrees
things
that
had
been
rarities
became
common
the
potato
the
turkey
and
conspicuous
in
the
long
list
tobacco
forks
an
italian
invention
displaced
the
filthy
use
of
the
fingers
it
may
be
said
that
the
diet
of
civilized
men
now
underwent
a
radical
change
tea
came
from
china
coffee
from
arabia
the
use
of
sugar
from
india
and
these
to
no
insignificant
degree
supplanted
fermented
liquors
carpets
replaced
on
the
floors
the
layer
of
straw
in
the
chambers
there
appeared
better
beds
in
the
wardrobes
cleaner
and
more
clothing
in
many
towns
the
aqueduct
was
substituted
for
the
public
fountain
and
the
ceilings
which
in
the
old
days
would
have
been
dingy
with
soot
and
dirt
were
now
decorated
with
ornamental
frescoes
baths
were
more
commonly
resorted
to
there
was
less
need
to
use
perfumery
for
the
concealment
of
personal
odors
an
increasing
taste
for
the
innocent
pleasures
of
horticulture
was
manifested
by
the
introduction
of
many
foreign
flowers
in
the
gardens
the
tuberose
the
auricula
the
crown
imperial
the
persian
lily
the
ranunculus
and
african
marigolds
in
the
streets
there
appeared
sedans
then
close
carriages
and
at
length
among
the
dull
rustics
mechanical
improvements
forced
their
way
and
gradually
attained
in
the
implements
for
ploughing
sowing
mowing
reaping
thrashing
the
perfection
of
our
own
times
mercantile
inventions
it
began
to
be
recognized
in
spite
of
the
preaching
of
the
mendicant
orders
that
poverty
is
the
source
of
crime
the
obstruction
to
knowledge
that
the
pursuit
of
riches
by
commerce
is
far
better
than
the
acquisition
of
power
by
war
for
though
it
may
be
true
as
montesquieu
says
that
while
commerce
unites
nations
it
antagonizes
individuals
and
makes
a
traffic
of
morality
it
alone
can
give
unity
to
the
world
its
dream
its
hope
is
universal
peace
medical
improvements
though
instead
of
a
few
pages
it
would
require
volumes
to
record
adequately
the
ameliorations
that
took
place
in
domestic
and
social
life
after
science
began
to
exert
its
beneficent
influences
and
inventive
talent
came
to
the
aid
of
industry
there
are
some
things
which
can
not
be
passed
in
silence
from
the
port
of
barcelona
the
spanish
khalifs
had
carried
on
an
enormous
commerce
and
they
with
their
coadjutors
jewish
merchants
had
adopted
or
originated
many
commercial
inventions
which
with
matters
of
pure
science
they
had
transmitted
to
the
trading
communities
of
europe
the
art
of
by
double
entry
was
thus
brought
into
upper
italy
the
different
kinds
of
insurance
were
adopted
though
strenuously
resisted
by
the
clergy
they
opposed
fire
and
marine
insurance
on
the
ground
that
it
is
a
tempting
of
providence
life
insurance
was
regarded
as
an
act
of
interference
with
the
consequences
of
god
will
houses
for
lending
money
on
interest
and
on
pledges
that
is
banking
and
pawnbroking
establishments
were
bitterly
denounced
and
especially
was
indignation
excited
against
the
taking
of
high
rates
of
interest
which
was
stigmatized
as
usury
a
feeling
existing
in
some
backward
communities
up
to
the
present
day
bills
of
exchange
in
the
present
form
and
terms
were
adopted
the
office
of
the
public
notary
established
and
protests
for
dishonored
obligations
resorted
to
indeed
it
may
be
said
with
but
little
exaggeration
that
the
commercial
machinery
now
used
was
thus
introduced
i
have
already
remarked
that
in
consequence
of
the
discovery
of
america
the
front
of
europe
had
been
changed
many
rich
italian
merchants
and
many
enterprising
jews
had
settled
in
holland
england
france
and
brought
into
those
countries
various
mercantile
devices
the
jews
who
cared
nothing
about
papal
maledictions
were
enriched
by
the
pontifical
action
in
relation
to
the
lending
of
money
at
high
interest
but
pius
perceiving
the
mistake
that
had
been
made
withdrew
his
opposition
pawnbroking
establishments
were
finally
authorized
by
leo
who
threatened
excommunication
of
those
who
wrote
against
them
in
their
turn
the
protestants
now
exhibited
a
dislike
against
establishments
thus
authorized
by
rome
as
the
theological
dogma
that
the
plague
like
the
earthquake
is
an
unavoidable
visitation
from
god
for
the
sins
of
men
began
to
be
doubted
attempts
were
made
to
resist
its
progress
by
the
establishment
of
quarantines
when
the
mohammedan
discovery
of
inoculation
was
brought
from
constantinople
in
by
lady
mary
wortley
montagu
it
was
so
strenuously
resisted
by
the
clergy
that
nothing
short
of
its
adoption
by
the
royal
family
of
england
brought
it
into
use
a
similar
resistance
was
exhibited
when
jenner
introduced
his
great
improvement
vaccination
yet
a
century
ago
it
was
the
exception
to
see
a
face
unpitted
by
smallpox
now
it
is
the
exception
to
see
one
so
disfigured
in
like
manner
when
the
great
american
discovery
of
anaesthetics
was
applied
in
obstetrical
cases
it
was
discouraged
not
so
much
for
physiological
reasons
as
under
the
pretense
that
it
was
an
impious
attempt
to
escape
from
the
curse
denounced
against
all

itself

after
the
introduction
of

into
italy
the

of

to

kinds

they
were

without

the

became
a
successful
rival
to
the
the
pious
frauds
enacted
in

that

had

by

comet
when
it
appeared
in
the
former
year
it
was
considered
as
the
harbinger
of
the
vengeance
of

the
dispenser
of
the
most
dreadful
of
his
retributions
war
pestilence
famine
by
order
of
the
pope
all
the
in
europe
were
rung
to
scare
it
away
the
faithful
were
commanded
to
add
each
day
another
prayer
and
as
their
prayers
had
often
in
so
marked
a
manner
been
answered
in
eclipses
and
droughts
and
rains
so
on
this
occasion
it
was
declared
that
a
victory
over
the
comet
had
been
vouchsafed
to
the
pope
but
in
the
mean
time
halley
guided
by
the
revelations
of
kepler
and
newton
had
discovered
that
its
motions
so
far
from
being
controlled
by
the
supplications
of
christendom
were
guided
in
an
elliptic
orbit
by
destiny
knowing
that
nature
bad
denied
to
him
an
opportunity
of
witnessing
the
fulfillment
of
his
daring
prophecy
he
besought
the
astronomers
of
the
succeeding
generation
to
watch
for
its
return
in
and
in
that
year
it
came
inventions
and
discoveries
whoever
will
in
a
spirit
of
impartiality
examine
what
had
been
done
by
catholicism
for
the
intellectual
and
material
advancement
of
europe
during
her
long
reign
and
what
has
been
done
by
science
in
its
brief
period
of
action
can
i
am
persuaded
come
to
no
other
conclusion
than
this
that
in
instituting
a
comparison
he
has
established
a
contrast
and
yet
how
imperfect
how
inadequate
is
the
catalogue
of
facts
i
have
furnished
in
the
foregoing
pages
i
have
said
nothing
of
the
spread
of
instruction
by
the
diffusion
of
the
arts
of
reading
and
writing
through
public
schools
and
the
consequent
creation
of
a
reading
community
the
modes
of
manufacturing
public
opinion
by

the
power
of

the
diffusion
of

public

the
individual
and
social
advantages

contrivances
with
which

given
us

therefore
added
to

its
vast
affiliated
industries

those
of
textile
fabrics
to
the
collection

have
passed
unnoticed
the
great
subject
of
the

by
itself
the
invention
of
the
the
and
many
other
contrivances
by
which
engines
can
be
constructed
with
almost
mathematical
correctness
i
have
said
nothing
adequate
about
the
railway
system
or
the
electric
telegraph
nor
about
the
calculus
or
lithography
the
airpump
or
the
voltaic
battery
the
discovery
of
uranus
or
neptune
and
more
than
a
hundred
asteroids
the
relation
of
meteoric
streams
to
comets
nothing
of
the
expeditions
by
land
and
sea
that
have
been
sent
forth
by
various
governments
for
the
determination
of
important
astronomical
or
geographical
questions
nothing
of
the
costly
and
accurate
experiments
they
have
caused
to
be
made
for
the
ascertainment
of
fundamental
physical
data
i
have
been
so
unjust
to
our
own
century
that
i
have
made
no
allusion
to
some
of
its
greatest
scientific
triumphs
its
grand
conceptions
in
natural
history
its
discoveries
in
magnetism
and
electricity
its
invention
of

its

its

the

of
the

importance
its
reconstruction
of

laying
the

its
improvements
and
advances
in
topographical
surveying
and
in
the
correct
representation
of
the
surface
of
the

i
have
said
nothing
about
and
armored
ships
nor
of
the
revolution
that
has
been
made
in
the
art
of
war
nothing
of
that
gift
to
women
the
nothing
of
the
noble
contentions
and
triumphs
of
the
arts
of
peace
the
industrial
exhibitions
and
world
fairs
what
a
catalogue
have
we
here
and
yet
how
imperfect
it
gives
merely
a
random
glimpse
at
an
intellectual
commotion
a
mention
of
things
as
they
casually
present
themselves
to
view
how
striking
the
contrast
between
this
literary
this
scientific
activity
and
the
stagnation
of
the
middle
ages
the
intellectual
enlightenment
that
surrounds
this
activity
has
imparted
unnumbered
blessings
to
the
human
race
in
russia
it
has
emancipated
a
vast
in
america
it
has
given
freedom
to
four
million
negro
slaves
in
place
of
the
sparse
dole
of
the
it
has
organized
charity
and
directed
legislation
to
the
poor
it
has
shown
medicine
its
true
function
to
prevent
rather
than
to
cure
disease
in
statesmanship
it
has
introduced
scientific
methods
displacing
random
and
empirical
legislation
by
a
laborious
ascertainment
of
social
facts
previous
to
the
application
of
legal
remedies
so
conspicuous
so
impressive
is
the
manner
in
which
it
is
elevating
men
that
the
hoary
nations
of
asia
seek
to
participate
in
the
boon
let
us
not
forget
that
our
action
on
them
must
be
attended
by
their
reaction
on
us
if
the
destruction
of
paganism
was
completed
when
all
the
gods
were
brought
to
rome
and
confronted
there
now
when
by
our
wonderful
facilities
of
locomotion
strange
nations
and
conflicting
religions
are
brought
into
common
presence
the
mohammedan
the
buddhist
the
of
them
all
must
ensue
in
that
conflict
science
alone
will
stand
secure
for
it
has
given
us
grander
views
of
the
universe
more
awful
views
of
god
american
and
french
revolutions
the
spirit
that
has
imparted
life
to
this
movement
that
has
animated
these
discoveries
and
inventions
is
individualism
in
some
minds
the
hope
of
gain
in
other
and
nobler
ones
the
expectation
of
honor
it
is
then
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
this
principle
found
a
political
embodiment
and
that
during
the
last
century
on
two
occasions
it
gave
rise
to
social
convulsions
the
american
and
the
french
revolutions
the
former
has
ended
in
the
dedication
of
a
continent
to
individualism
there
under
republican
forms
before
the
close
of
the
present
century
one
hundred
million
people
with
no
more
restraint
than
their
common
security
requires
will
be
pursuing
an
unfettered
career
the
latter
though
it
has
modified
the
political
aspect
of
all
europe
and
though
illustrated
by
surprising
military
successes
has
thus
far
not
consummated
its
intentions
again
and
again
it
has
brought
upon
france
fearful
disasters
her
dual
form
of
government
her
allegiance
to
her
two
sovereigns
the
political
and
the
spiritual
has
made
her
at
once
the
leader
and
the
antagonist
of
modern
progress
with
one
hand
she
has
enthroned
reason
with
the
other
she
has
and
sustained
the
pope
nor
will
this
anomaly
in
her
conduct
cease
until
she
bestows
a
true
education
on
all
her
children
even
on
those
of
the
humblest
rustic
science
and
civilization
the
intellectual
attack
made
on
existing
opinions
by
the
french
revolution
was
not
of
a
scientific
but
of
a
literary
character
it
was
critical
and
aggressive
but
science
has
never
been
an
aggressor
she
has
always
acted
on
the
defensive
and
left
to
her
antagonist
the
making
of
wanton
attacks
nevertheless
literary
dissent
is
not
of
such
ominous
import
as
scientific
for
literature
is
in
its
nature
local
science
is
cosmopolitan
if
now
we
demand
what
has
science
done
for
the
promotion
of
modern
civilization
what
has
it
done
for
the
happiness
the
of
society
we
shall
find
our
answer
in
the
same
manner
that
we
reached
a
just
estimate
of
what
latin
christianity
had
done
the
reader
of
the
foregoing
paragraphs
would
undoubtedly
infer
that
there
must
have
been
an
amelioration
in
the
lot
of
our
race
but
when
we
apply
the
touchstone
of
statistics
that
inference
gathers
precision
systems
of
philosophy
and
forms
of
religion
find
a
measure
of
their
influence
on
humanity
in
latin
christianity
in
a
thousand
years
could
not
double
the
population
of
europe
it
did
not
add
perceptibly
to
the
term
of
individual
life
but
as
jarvis
in
his
report
to
the
massachusetts
board
of
health
has
stated
at
the
epoch
of
the
reformation
the
average
longevity
in
geneva
was
years
between
and
it
was
as
large
a
number
of
persons
now
live
to
seventy
years
as
lived
to
forty
three
hundred
years
ago
in
the
british
government
borrowed
money
by
selling
annuities
on
lives
from
infancy
upward
on
the
basis
of
the
average
longevity
the
contract
was
profitable
years
later
another
tontine
or
scale
of
annuities
on
the
basis
of
the
same
expectation
of
life
as
in
the
previous
century
was
issued
these
latter
annuitants
however
lived
so
much
longer
than
their
predecessors
that
it
proved
to
be
a
very
costly
loan
for
the
government
it
was
found
that
while
ten
thousand
of
each
sex
in
the
first
tontine
died
under
the
age
of
only
five
thousand
seven
hundred
and
males
and
six
thousand
four
hundred
and
sixteen
females
in
the
second
tontine
died
at
the
same
age
one
hundred
years
later
we
have
been
comparing
the
spiritual
with
the
practical
the
imaginary
with
the
real
the
maxims
that
have
been
followed
in
the
earlier
and
the
later
period
produced
their
inevitable
result
in
the
former
that
maxim

the

of
thought
in

can
hide
from
himself
the
fact
that
an
intellectual
a
religious
crisis
is
impending
in
all
directions
we
see
the
lowering
skies
we
hear
the
mutterings
of
the
coming
storm
in
germany
the
national
party
is
arraying
itself
against
the
ultramontane
in
france
the
men
of
progress
are
struggling
against
the
unprogressive
and
in
their
contest
the
political
supremacy
of
that
great
country
is
wellnigh
neutralized
or
lost
in
italy
rome
has
passed
into
the
hands
of
an
excommunicated
king
the
sovereign
pontiff
feigning
that
he
is
a
prisoner
is
fulminating
from
the
vatican
his
anathemas
and
in
the
midst
of
the
most
convincing
proofs
of
his
manifold
errors
asserting
his
own
infallibility
a
catholic
archbishop
with
truth
declares
that
the
whole
civil
society
of
europe
seems
to
be
withdrawing
itself
in
its
public
life
from
christianity
in
england
and
america
religious
persons
perceive
with
dismay
that
the
intellectual
basis
of
faith
has
been
undermined
by
the
spirit
of
the
age
they
prepare
for
the
approaching
disaster
in
the
best
manner
they
can
the
most
serious
trial
through
which
society
can
pass
is
encountered
in
the
exuviation
of
its
religious
restraints
the
history
of
greece
and
the
history
of
rome
exhibit
to
us
in
an
impressive
manner
how
great
are
the
perils
but
it
is
not
given
to
religions
to
endure
forever
they
necessarily
undergo
transformation
with
the
intellectual
development
of
man
how
many
countries
are
there
professing
the
same
religion
now
that
they
did
at
the
birth
of
christ
it
is
estimated
that
the
entire
population
of
europe
is
about
three
hundred
and
one
million
of
these
one
hundred
and
million
are
roman
catholics
million
are
greek
catholics
of
protestants
there
are
million
separated
into
many
sects
of
jews
five
million
of
mohammedans
seven
million
of
the
religious
subdivisions
of
america
an
accurate
numerical
statement
can
not
be
given
the
whole
of
christian
south
america
is
roman
catholic
the
same
may
be
said
of
central
america
and
of
mexico
as
also
of
the
spanish
and
french
west
india
possessions
in
the
united
states
and
canada
the
protestant
population
predominates
to
australia
the
same
remark
applies
in
india
the
sparse
christian
population
sinks
into
insignificance
in
presence
of
two
hundred
million
mohammedans
and
other
oriental
denominations
the
roman
catholic
church
is
the
most
widely
diffused
and
the
most
powerfully
organized
of
all
modern
societies
it
is
far
more
a
political
than
a
religious
combination
its
principle
is
that
all
power
is
in
the
clergy
and
that
for
laymen
there
is
only
the
privilege
of
obedience
the
republican
forms
under
which
the
churches
existed
in
primitive
christianity
have
gradually
merged
into
an
absolute
centralization
with
a
man
as
at
its
head
this
church
asserts
that
the
divine
commission
under
which
it
acts
comprises
civil
government
that
it
has
a
right
to
use
the
state
for
its
own
purposes
but
that
the
state
has
no
right
to
intermeddle
with
it
that
even
in
protestant
countries
it
is
not
merely
a
coordinate
government
but
the
sovereign
power
it
insists
that
the
state
has
no
rights
over
any
thing
which
it
declares
to
be
in
its
domain
and
that
protestantism
being
a
mere
rebellion
has
no
rights
at
all
that
even
in
protestant
communities
the
catholic
bishop
is
the
only
lawful
spiritual
pastor
it
is
plain
therefore
that
of
professing
christians
the
vast
majority
are
catholic
and
such
is
the
authoritative
demand
of
the
papacy
for
supremacy
that
in
any
survey
of
the
present
religious
condition
of
christendom
regard
must
be
mainly
had
to
its
acts
its
movements
are
guided
by
the
highest
intelligence
and
skill
catholicism
obeys
the
orders
of
one
man
and
has
therefore
a
unity
a
compactness
a
power
which
protestant
denominations
do
not
possess
moreover
it
derives
inestimable
strength
from
the
souvenirs
of
the
great
name
of
rome
unembarrassed
by
any
hesitating
sentiment
the
papacy
has
contemplated
the
coming
intellectual
crisis
it
has
pronounced
its
decision
and
occupied
what
seems
to
it
to
be
the
most
advantageous
ground
this
definition
of
position
we
find
in
the
acts
of
the
late
vatican
council
the
oecumenical
council
pius
by
a
bull
dated
june
convoked
an
oecumenical
council
to
meet
in
rome
on
december
its
sessions
ended
in
july
among
other
matters
submitted
to
its
consideration
two
stand
forth
in
conspicuous
prominence
they
are
the
assertion
of
the
infallibility
of
the
roman
pontiff
and
the
definition
of
the
relations
of
religion
to
science
but
the
convocation
of
the
council
was
far
from
meeting
with
general
approval
the
views
of
the
oriental
churches
were
for
the
most
part
unfavorable
they
affirmed
that
they
saw
a
desire
in
the
roman
pontiff
to
set
himself
up
as
the
head
of
christianity
whereas
they
recognized
the
lord
jesus
christ
alone
as
the
head
of
the
church
they
believed
that
the
council
would
only
lead
to
new
quarrels
and
scandals
the
sentiment
of
these
venerable
churches
is
well
shown
by
the
incident
that
when
in
the
nestorian
patriarch
simeon
had
been
invited
by
the
chaldean
patriarch
to
return
to
roman
catholic
unity
he
in
his
reply
showed
that
there
was
no
prospect
for
harmonious
action
between
the
east
and
the
west
you
invite
me
to
kiss
humbly
the
slipper
of
the
bishop
of
rome
but
is
he
not
in
every
respect
a
man
like
yourself
is
his
dignity
superior
to
yours
we
will
never
permit
to
be
introduced
into
our
holy
temples
of
worship
images
and
statues
which
are
nothing
but
abominable
and
impure
idols
what
shall
we
attribute
to
almighty
god
a
mother
as
you
dare
to
do
away
from
us
such
blasphemy
expectations
of
the
papacy
eventually
the
patriarchs
archbishops
and
bishops
from
all
regions
of
the
world
who
took
part
in
this
council
were
seven
hundred
and
four
rome
had
seen
very
plainly
that
science
was
not
only
rapidly
undermining
the
dogmas
of
the
papacy
but
was
gathering
great
political
power
she
recognized
that
all
over
europe
there
was
a
secession
among
persons
of
education
and
that
its
true
focus
was
north
germany
she
looked
therefore
with
deep
interest
on
the
war
giving
to
austria
whatever
encouragement
she
could
the
battle
of
sadowa
was
a
bitter
disappointment
to
her
with
satisfaction
again
she
looked
upon
the
breaking
out
of
the
war
not
doubting
that
its
issue
would
be
favorable
to
france
and
therefore
favorable
to
her
here
again
she
was
doomed
to
disappointment
at
sedan
having
now
no
further
hope
for
many
years
to
come
from
external
war
she
resolved
to
see
what
could
be
done
by
internal
insurrection
and
the
present
movement
in
the
german
empire
is
the
result
of
her
machinations
had
austria
or
had
france
succeeded
protestantism
would
have
been
overthrown
along
with
prussia
but
while
these
military
movements
were
being
carried
on
a
movement
of
a
different
an
intellectual
kind
was
engaged
in
its
principle
was
to
restore
the
mediaeval
doctrines
and
practices
carrying
them
to
an
extreme
no
matter
what
the
consequences
might
be
encyclical
letter
and
syllabus
not
only
was
it
asserted
that
the
papacy
has
a
divine
right
to
participate
in
the
government
of
all
countries
coordinately
with
their
temporal
authorities
but
that
the
supremacy
of
rome
in
this
matter
must
be
recognized
and
that
in
any
question
between
them
the
temporal
authority
must
conform
itself
to
her
order
and
since
the
endangering
of
her
position
had
been
mainly
brought
about
by
the
progress
of
science
she
presumed
to
define
its
boundaries
and
prescribe
limits
to
its
authority
still
more
she
undertook
to
denounce
modern
civilization
these
measures
were
contemplated
soon
after
the
return
of
his
holiness
from
gaeta
in
and
were
undertaken
by
the
advice
of
the
jesuits
who
lingering
in
the
hope
that
god
would
work
the
impossible
supposed
that
the
papacy
in
its
old
age
might
be
reinvigorated
the
organ
of
the
curia
proclaimed
the
absolute
independence
of
the
church
as
regards
the
state
the
dependence
of
the
bishops
on
the
pope
of
the
diocesan
clergy
on
the
bishops
the
obligation
of
the
protestants
to
abandon
their
atheism
and
return
to
the
fold
the
absolute
condemnation
of
all
kinds
of
toleration
in
december
in
an
assembly
of
bishops
the
pope
had
proclaimed
the
dogma
of
the
immaculate
conception
ten
years
subsequently
he
put
forth
the
celebrated
encyclical
letter
and
the
syllabus
the
encyclical
letter
is
dated
december
it
was
drawn
up
by
learned
ecclesiastics
and
subsequently
debated
at
the
congregation
of
the
holy
office
then
forwarded
to
prelates
and
finally
gone
over
by
the
pope
and
cardinals
encyclical
letter
and
syllabus
many
of
the
clergy
objected
to
its
condemnation
of
modern
civilization
some
of
the
cardinals
were
reluctant
to
concur
in
it
the
catholic
press
accepted
it
not
however
without
misgivings
and
regrets
the
protestant
governments
put
no
obstacle
in
its
way
the
catholic
were
embarrassed
by
it
france
allowed
the
publication
only
of
that
portion
proclaiming
the
jubilee
austria
and
italy
permitted
its
introduction
but
withheld
their
approval
the
political
press
and
legislatures
of
catholic
countries
gave
it
an
unfavorable
reception
many
deplored
it
as
likely
to
widen
the
breach
between
the
church
and
modern
society
the
italian
press
regarded
it
as
determining
a
war
without
truce
or
armistice
between
the
papacy
and
modern
civilization
even
in
spain
there
were
journals
that
regretted
the
obstinacy
and
blindness
of
the
court
of
rome
in
branding
and
condemning
modern
civilization
it
denounces
that
most
pernicious
and
insane
opinion
that
liberty
of
conscience
and
of
worship
is
the
right
of
every
man
and
that
this
right
ought
in
every
state
to
be
proclaimed
and
asserted
by
law
and
that
the
will
of
the
people
manifested
by
public
opinion
as
it
is
called
or
by
other
means
constitutes
a
supreme
law
independent
of
all
divine
and
human
rights
it
denies
the
right
of
parents
to
educate
their
children
outside
the
catholic
church
it
denounces
the
impudence
of
those
who
presume
to
subordinate
the
authority
of
the
church
and
of
the
apostolic
see
conferred
upon
it
by
christ
our
lord
to
the
judgment
of
the
civil
authority
his
holiness
commends
to
the
venerable
brothers
to
whom
the
encyclical
is
addressed
incessant
prayer
and
in
order
that
god
may
accede
the
more
easily
to
our
and
your
prayers
let
us
employ
in
all
confidence
as
our
mediatrix
with
him
the
virgin
mary
mother
of
god
who
sits
as
a
queen
upon
the
right
hand
of
her
son
our
lord
jesus
christ
in
a
golden
vestment
clothed
around
with
various
adornments
there
is
nothing
she
can
not
obtain
from
him
convocation
of
the
council
plainly
the
principle
now
avowed
by
the
papacy
must
bring
it
into
collision
even
with
governments
which
had
heretofore
maintained
amicable
relations
with
it
great
dissatisfaction
was
manifested
by
russia
and
the
incidents
that
ensued
drew
forth
from
his
holiness
an
allocution
november
condemnatory
of
the
course
of
that
government
to
this
russia
replied
by
declaring
the
concordat
of
abrogated
undeterred
by
the
result
of
the
battle
of
sadowa
july
though
it
was
plain
that
the
political
condition
of
europe
was
now
profoundly
affected
and
especially
the
relations
of
the
papacy
the
pope
delivered
an
allocution
june
confirming
the
encyclical
and
syllabus
he
announced
his
intention
of
convoking
an
oecumenical
council
accordingly
as
we
have
already
mentioned
in
the
following
year
june
a
bull
was
issued
convoking
that
council
misunderstandings
however
had
now
sprung
up
with
austria
the
austrian
reichsrath
had
adopted
laws
introducing
equality
of
civil
rights
for
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
empire
and
restricting
the
influence
of
the
church
this
produced
on
the
part
of
the
papal
government
an
expostulation
acting
as
russia
had
done
the
austrian
government
found
it
necessary
to
abrogate
the
concordat
of
in
france
as
above
stated
the
publication
of
the
entire
syllabus
was
not
permitted
but
prussia
desirous
of
keeping
on
good
terms
with
the
papacy
did
not
disallow
it
the
exacting
disposition
of
the
papacy
increased
it
was
openly
declared
that
the
faithful
must
now
sacrifice
to
the
church
property
life
and
even
their
intellectual
convictions
the
protestants
and
the
greeks
were
invited
to
tender
their
submission
the
vatican
council
on
the
appointed
day
the
council
opened
its
objects
were
to
translate
the
syllabus
into
practice
to
establish
the
dogma
of
papal
infallibility
and
define
the
relations
of
religion
to
science
every
preparation
had
been
made
that
the
points
determined
on
should
be
carried
the
bishops
were
informed
that
they
were
coming
to
rome
not
to
deliberate
but
to
sanction
decrees
previously
made
by
an
infallible
pope
no
idea
was
entertained
of
any
such
thing
as
free
discussion
the
minutes
of
the
meetings
were
not
permitted
to
be
inspected
the
prelates
of
the
opposition
were
hardly
allowed
to
speak
on
january
a
petition
requesting
that
the
infallibility
of
the
pope
should
be
defined
was
presented
an
opposition
petition
of
the
minority
was
offered
hereupon
the
deliberations
of
the
minority
were
forbidden
and
their
publications
prohibited
and
though
the
curia
had
provided
a
compact
majority
it
was
found
expedient
to
issue
an
order
that
to
carry
any
proposition
it
was
not
necessary
that
the
vote
should
be
near
unanimity
a
simple
majority
sufficed
the
remonstrances
of
the
minority
were
altogether
unheeded
as
the
council
pressed
forward
to
its
object
foreign
authorities
became
alarmed
at
its
reckless
determination
a
petition
drawn
up
by
the
archbishop
of
vienna
and
signed
by
several
cardinals
and
archbishops
entreated
his
holiness
not
to
submit
the
dogma
of
infallibility
for
consideration
because
the
church
has
to
sustain
at
present
a
struggle
unknown
in
former
times
against
men
who
oppose
religion
itself
as
an
institution
baneful
to
human
nature
and
that
it
is
inopportune
to
impose
upon
catholic
nations
led
into
temptation
by
so
many
machinations
more
dogmas
than
the
council
of
trent
proclaimed
it
added
that
the
definition
demanded
would
furnish
fresh
arms
to
the
enemies
of
religion
to
excite
against
the
catholic
church
the
resentment
of
men
avowedly
the
best
the
austrian
addressed
a
protest
to
the
papal
government
warning
it
against
any
steps
that
might
lead
to
encroachments
on
the
rights
of
austria
the
french
government
also
addressed
a
note
suggesting
that
a
french
bishop
should
explain
to
the
council
the
condition
and
the
rights
of
france
to
this
the
papal
government
replied
that
a
bishop
could
not
reconcile
the
double
duties
of
an
ambassador
and
a
father
of
the
council
hereupon
the
french
government
in
a
very
respectful
note
remarked
that
to
prevent
ultra
opinions
from
becoming
dogmas
it
reckoned
on
the
moderation
of
the
bishops
and
the
prudence
of
the
holy
father
and
to
defend
its
civil
and
political
laws
against
the
encroachments
of
the
theocracy
it
had
counted
on
public
reason
and
the
patriotism
of
french
catholics
in
these
remonstrances
the
confederation
joined
seriously
pressing
them
on
the
consideration
of
the
papal
government
on
april
von
arnim
the
prussian
embassador
united
with
daru
the
french
minister
in
suggesting
to
the
curia
the
inexpediency
of
reviving
mediaeval
ideas
the
minority
bishops
thus
encouraged
demanded
now
that
the
relations
of
the
spiritual
to
the
secular
power
should
be
determined
before
the
pope
infallibility
was
discussed
and
that
it
should
be
settled
whether
christ
had
conferred
on
peter
and
his
successors
a
power
over
kings
and
emperors
infallibility
of
the
pope
no
regard
was
paid
to
this
not
even
delay
was
consented
to
the
jesuits
who
were
at
the
bottom
of
the
movement
carried
their
measures
through
the
packed
assembly
with
a
high
hand
the
council
omitted
no
device
to
screen
itself
from
popular
criticism
its
proceedings
were
conducted
with
the
utmost
secrecy
all
who
took
part
in
them
were
bound
by
a
solemn
oath
to
observe
silence
on
july
the
votes
were
taken
of
votes
were
affirmative
under
the
majority
rule
the
measure
was
pronounced
carried
and
five
days
subsequently
the
pope
proclaimed
the
dogma
of
his
infallibility
it
has
often
been
remarked
that
this
was
the
day
on
which
the
french
declared
war
against
prussia
eight
days
afterward
the
french
troops
were
withdrawn
from
rome
perhaps
both
the
statesman
and
the
philosopher
will
admit
that
an
infallible
pope
would
be
a
great
harmonizing
element
if
only
could
acknowledge
him
hereupon
the
king
of
italy
addressed
an
autograph
letter
to
the
pope
setting
forth
in
very
respectful
terms
the
necessity
that
his
troops
should
advance
and
occupy
positions
indispensable
to
the
security
of
his
holiness
and
the
maintenance
of
order
that
while
satisfying
the
national
aspirations
the
chief
of
catholicity
surrounded
by
the
devotion
of
the
italian
populations
might
preserve
on
the
banks
of
the
tiber
a
glorious
seat
independent
of
all
human
sovereignty
to
this
his
holiness
replied
in
a
brief
and
caustic
letter
i
give
thanks
to
god
who
has
permitted
your
majesty
to
fill
the
last
days
of
my
life
with
bitterness
for
the
rest
i
can
not
grant
certain
requests
nor
conform
with
certain
principles
contained
in
your
letter
again
i
call
upon
god
and
into
his
hands
commit
my
cause
which
is
his
cause
i
pray
god
to
grant
your
majesty
many
graces
to
free
you
from
dangers
and
to
dispense
to
you
his
mercy
which
you
so
much
need
the
italian
government
the
italian
troops
met
with
but
little
resistance
they
occupied
rome
on
september
a
manifesto
was
issued
setting
forth
the
details
of
a
plebiscitum
the
vote
to
be
by
ballot
the
question
the
unification
of
italy
its
result
showed
how
completely
the
popular
mind
in
italy
is
emancipated
from
theology
in
the
roman
provinces
the
number
of
votes
on
the
lists
was
the
number
who
voted
the
number
who
voted
for
annexation
the
number
who
voted
against
it
votes
annulled
the
parliament
of
italy
ratified
the
vote
of
the
roman
people
for
annexation
by
a
vote
of
to
a
royal
decree
now
announced
the
annexation
of
the
papal
states
to
the
kingdom
of
italy
and
a
manifesto
was
issued
indicating
the
details
of
the
arrangement
it
declared
that
by
these
concessions
the
italian
government
seeks
to
prove
to
europe
that
italy
respects
the
sovereignty
of
the
pope
in
conformity
with
the
principle
of
a
free
church
in
a
free
state
affairs
in
prussia
in
the
war
it
had
been
the
hope
of
the
papacy
to
restore
the
german
empire
under
austria
and
make
germany
a
catholic
nation
in
the
war
the
french
expected
ultramontane
sympathies
in
germany
no
means
were
spared
to
excite
catholic
sentiment
against
the
protestants
no
vilification
was
spared
they
were
spoken
of
as
atheists
they
were
declared
incapable
of
being
honest
men
their
sects
were
pointed
out
as
indicating
that
their
secession
was
in
a
state
of
dissolution
the
followers
of
luther
are
the
most
abandoned
men
in
all
europe
even
the
pope
himself
presuming
that
the
whole
world
had
forgotten
all
history
did
not
hesitate
to
say
let
the
german
people
understand
that
no
other
church
but
that
of
rome
is
the
church
of
freedom
and
progress
meantime
among
the
clergy
of
germany
a
party
was
organized
to
remonstrate
against
and
even
resist
the
papal
usurpation
it
protested
against
a
man
being
placed
on
the
throne
of
god
against
a
of
any
kind
nor
would
it
yield
its
scientific
convictions
to
ecclesiastical
authority
some
did
not
hesitate
to
accuse
the
pope
himself
of
being
a
heretic
against
these
insubordinates
excommunications
began
to
be
fulminated
and
at
length
it
was
demanded
that
certain
professors
and
teachers
should
be
removed
from
their
offices
and
infallibilists
substituted
with
this
demand
the
prussian
government
declined
to
comply
the
prussian
government
had
earnestly
desired
to
remain
on
amicable
terms
with
the
papacy
it
had
no
wish
to
enter
on
a
theological
quarrel
but
gradually
the
conviction
was
forced
upon
it
that
the
question
was
not
a
religious
but
a
political
one
whether
the
power
of
the
state
should
be
used
against
the
state
a
teacher
in
a
gymnasium
had
been
excommunicated
the
government
on
being
required
to
dismiss
him
refused
the
church
authorities
denounced
this
as
an
attack
upon
faith
the
emperor
sustained
his
minister
the
organ
of
the
infallible
party
threatened
the
emperor
with
the
opposition
of
all
good
catholics
and
told
him
that
in
a
contention
with
the
pope
systems
of
government
can
and
must
change
it
was
now
plain
to
every
one
that
the
question
had
become
who
is
to
be
master
in
the
state
the
government
or
the
roman
church
it
is
plainly
impossible
for
men
to
live
under
two
governments
one
of
which
declares
to
be
wrong
what
the
other
commands
if
the
government
will
not
submit
to
the
roman
church
the
two
are
enemies
a
conflict
was
thus
forced
upon
prussia
by
rome
a
conflict
in
which
the
latter
impelled
by
her
antagonism
to
modern
civilization
is
clearly
the
aggressor
action
of
the
prussian
government
the
government
now
recognizing
its
antagonist
defended
itself
by
abolishing
the
catholic
department
in
the
ministry
of
public
worship
this
was
about
midsummer
in
the
following
november
the
imperial
parliament
passed
a
law
that
ecclesiastics
abusing
their
office
to
the
disturbance
of
the
public
peace
should
be
criminally
punished
and
guided
by
the
principle
that
the
future
belongs
to
him
to
whom
the
school
belongs
a
movement
arose
for
the
purpose
of
separating
the
schools
from
the
church
the
church
a
political
power
the
jesuit
party
was
extending
and
strengthening
an
organization
all
over
germany
based
on
the
principle
that
state
legislation
in
ecclesiastical
matters
is
not
binding
here
was
an
act
of
open
insurrection
could
the
government
allow
itself
to
be
intimidated
the
bishop
of
ermeland
declared
that
he
would
not
obey
the
laws
of
the
state
if
they
touched
the
church
the
government
stopped
the
payment
of
his
salary
and
perceiving
that
there
could
be
no
peace
so
long
as
the
jesuits
were
permitted
to
remain
in
the
country
their
expulsion
was
resolved
on
and
carried
into
effect
at
the
close
of
his
holiness
delivered
an
allocution
in
which
he
touched
on
the
persecution
of
the
church
in
the
german
empire
and
asserted
that
the
church
alone
has
a
right
to
fix
the
limits
between
its
domain
and
that
of
the
state
a
dangerous
and
inadmissible
principle
since
under
the
term
morals
the
church
comprises
all
the
relations
of
men
to
each
other
and
asserts
that
whatever
does
not
assist
her
oppresses
her
hereupon
a
few
days
subsequently
january
four
laws
were
brought
forward
by
the
government
regulating
the
means
by
which
a
person
might
sever
his
connection
with
the
church
restricting
the
church
in
the
exercise
of
ecclesiastical
punishments
regulating
the
ecclesiastical
power
of
discipline
forbidding
bodily
chastisement
regulating
fines
and
banishments
granting
the
privilege
of
an
appeal
to
the
royal
court
of
justice
for
ecclesiastical
affairs
the
decision
of
which
is
final
ordaining
the
preliminary
education
and
appointment
of
priests
they
must
have
had
a
satisfactory
education
passed
a
public
examination
conducted
by
the
state
and
have
a
knowledge
of
philosophy
history
and
german
literature
institutions
refusing
to
be
superintended
by
the
state
are
to
be
closed
these
laws
demonstrate
that
germany
is
resolved
that
she
will
no
longer
be
dictated
to
nor
embarrassed
by
a
few
italian
noble
families
that
she
will
be
master
of
her
own
house
she
sees
in
the
conflict
not
an
affair
of
religion
or
of
conscience
but
a
struggle
between
the
sovereignty
of
state
legislation
and
the
sovereignty
of
the
church
she
treats
the
papacy
not
in
the
aspect
of
a
religious
but
of
a
political
power
and
is
resolved
that
the
declaration
of
the
prussian
constitution
shall
be
maintained
that
the
exercise
of
religious
freedom
must
not
interfere
with
the
duties
of
a
citizen
toward
the
community
and
the
state
dual
government
in
europe
with
truth
it
is
affirmed
that
the
papacy
is
administered
not
oecumenically
not
as
a
universal
church
for
all
the
nations
but
for
the
benefit
of
some
italian
families
look
at
its
composition
it
consists
of
pope
cardinal
bishops
cardinal
deacons
who
at
the
present
moment
are
all
italians
cardinal
priests
nearly
all
italians
ministers
and
secretaries
of
the
sacred
congregation
in
rome
all
italians
france
has
not
given
a
pope
since
the
middle
ages
it
is
the
same
with
austria
portugal
spain
in
spite
of
all
attempts
to
change
this
system
of
exclusion
to
open
the
dignities
of
the
church
to
all
catholicism
no
foreigner
can
reach
the
holy
chair
it
is
recognized
that
the
church
is
a
domain
given
by
god
to
the
princely
italian
families
of
members
of
the
present
college
of
cardinals
forty
are
italians
that
is
beyond
their
proper
share
the
to
the
progress
of
europe
has
been
its
dual
system
of
government
so
long
as
every
nation
had
two
sovereigns
a
temporal
one
at
home
and
a
spiritual
one
in
a
foreign
land
there
being
different
temporal
masters
in
different
nations
but
only
one
foreign
master
for
all
the
pontiff
at
rome
how
was
it
possible
that
history
should
present
us
with
any
thing
more
than
a
narrative
of
the
strifes
of
these
rival
powers
whoever
will
reflect
on
this
state
of
things
will
see
how
it
is
that
those
nations
which
have
shaken
off
the
dual
form
of
government
are
those
which
have
made
the
greatest
advance
he
will
discern
what
is
the
cause
of
the
paralysis
which
has
befallen
france
on
one
hand
she
wishes
to
be
the
leader
of
europe
on
the
other
she
clings
to
a
dead
past
for
the
sake
of
propitiating
her
ignorant
classes
she
enters
upon
lines
of
policy
which
her
intelligence
must
condemn
so
evenly
balanced
are
the
two
sovereignties
under
which
she
lives
that
sometimes
one
sometimes
the
other
prevails
and
not
unfrequently
the
one
uses
the
other
as
an
engine
for
the
accomplishment
of
its
ends
intentions
of
the
pope
but
this
dual
system
approaches
its
close
to
the
northern
nations
less
imaginative
and
less
superstitious
it
had
long
ago
become
intolerable
they
rejected
it
summarily
at
the
epoch
of
the
reformation
notwithstanding
the
protestations
and
pretensions
of
rome
russia
happier
than
the
rest
has
never
acknowledged
the
influence
of
any
foreign
spiritual
power
she
gloried
in
her
attachment
to
the
ancient
greek
rite
and
saw
in
the
papacy
nothing
more
than
a
troublesome
dissenter
from
the
primitive
faith
in
america
the
temporal
and
the
spiritual
have
been
absolutely
divorced
the
latter
is
not
permitted
to
have
any
thing
to
do
with
affairs
of
state
though
in
all
other
respects
liberty
is
conceded
to
it
the
condition
of
the
new
world
also
satisfies
us
that
both
forms
of
christianity
catholic
and
protestant
have
lost
their
expansive
power
neither
can
pass
beyond
its
the
catholic
republics
remain
catholic
the
protestant
protestant
and
among
the
latter
the
disposition
to
sectarian
isolation
is
disappearing
persons
of
different
denominations
consort
without
hesitation
together
they
gather
their
current
opinions
from
newspapers
not
from
the
church
pius
in
the
movements
we
have
been
considering
has
had
two
objects
in
view
the
more
thorough
centralization
of
the
papacy
with
a
spiritual
autocrat
assuming
the
prerogatives
of
god
at
its
head
control
over
the
intellectual
development
of
the
nations
professing
christianity
the
logical
consequence
of
the
former
of
these
is
political
intervention
he
insists
that
in
all
cases
the
temporal
must
subordinate
itself
to
the
spiritual
power
all
laws
inconsistent
with
the
interests
of
the
church
must
be
repealed
they
are
not
binding
on
the
faithful
in
the
preceding
pages
i
have
briefly
related
some
of
the
complications
that
have
already
occurred
in
the
attempt
to
maintain
this
policy
the
syllabus
i
now
come
to
the
consideration
of
the
manner
in
which
the
papacy
proposes
to
establish
its
intellectual
control
how
it
defines
its
relation
to
its
antagonist
science
and
seeking
a
restoration
of
the
mediaeval
condition
opposes
modern
civilization
and
denounces
modern
society
the
encyclical
and
syllabus
present
the
principles
which
it
was
the
object
of
the
vatican
council
to
carry
into
practical
effect
the
syllabus
stigmatizes
pantheism
naturalism
and
absolute
rationalism
denouncing
such
opinions
as
that
god
is
the
world
that
there
is
no
god
other
than
nature
that
theological
matters
must
be
treated
in
the
same
manner
as
philosophical
ones
that
the
methods
and
principles
by
which
the
old
scholastic
doctors
cultivated
theology
are
no
longer
suitable
to
the
demands
of
the
age
and
the
progress
of
science
that
every
man
is
free
to
embrace
and
profess
the
religion
he
may
believe
to
be
true
guided
by
the
light
of
his
reason
that
it
appertains
to
the
civil
power
to
define
what
are
the
rights
and
limits
in
which
the
church
may
exercise
authority
that
the
church
has
not
the
right
of
availing
herself
of
force
or
any
direct
or
indirect
temporal
power
that
the
church
ought
to
be
separated
from
the
state
and
the
state
from
the
church
that
it
is
no
longer
expedient
that
the
catholic
religion
shall
be
held
as
the
only
religion
of
the
state
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
modes
of
worship
that
persons
coming
to
reside
in
catholic
countries
have
a
right
to
the
public
exercise
of
their
own
worship
that
the
roman
pontiff
can
and
ought
to
reconcile
himself
to
and
agree
with
the
progress
of
modern
civilization
the
syllabus
claims
the
right
of
the
church
to
control
public
schools
and
denies
the
right
of
the
state
in
that
respect
it
claims
the
control
over
marriage
and
divorce
such
of
these
principles
as
the
council
found
expedient
at
present
to
formularize
were
set
forth
by
it
in
the
dogmatic
constitution
of
the
catholic
faith
the
essential
points
of
this
constitution
more
especially
as
regards
the
relations
of
religion
to
science
we
have
now
to
examine
it
will
be
understood
that
the
following
does
not
present
the
entire
document
but
only
an
abstract
of
what
appear
to
be
its
more
important
parts
constitution
of
catholic
faith
this
definition
opens
with
a
severe
review
of
the
principles
and
consequences
of
the
protestant
reformation
the
rejection
of
the
divine
authority
of
the
church
to
teach
and
the
subjection
of
all
things
belonging
to
religion
to
the
judgment
of
each
individual
have
led
to
the
production
of
many
sects
and
as
these
differed
and
disputed
with
each
other
all
belief
in
christ
was
overthrown
in
the
minds
of
not
a
few
and
the
holy
scriptures
began
to
be
counted
as
myths
and
fables
christianity
has
been
rejected
and
the
reign
of
mere
reason
as
they
call
it
or
nature
substituted
many
falling
into
the
abyss
of
pantheism
materialism
and
atheism
and
repudiating
the
reasoning
nature
of
man
and
every
rule
of
right
and
wrong
they
are
laboring
to
overthrow
the
very
foundations
of
human
society
as
this
impious
heresy
is
spreading
everywhere
not
a
few
catholics
have
been
inveigled
by
it
they
have
confounded
human
science
and
divine
faith
but
the
church
the
mother
and
mistress
of
nations
is
ever
ready
to
strengthen
the
weak
to
take
to
her
bosom
those
that
return
and
carry
them
on
to
better
things
and
now
the
bishops
of
the
whole
world
being
gathered
together
in
this
oecumenical
council
and
the
holy
ghost
sitting
therein
and
judging
with
us
we
have
determined
to
declare
from
this
chair
of
peter
the
saving
doctrine
of
christ
and
proscribe
and
condemn
the
opposing
errors
of
god
the
creator
of
all
the
holy
catholic
apostolic
roman
church
believes
that
there
is
one
true
and
living
god
creator
and
lord
of
heaven
and
earth
almighty
eternal
immense
incomprehensible
infinite
in
understanding
and
will
and
in
all
perfection
he
is
distinct
from
the
world
of
his
own
most
free
counsel
he
made
alike
out
of
nothing
two
created
creatures
a
spiritual
and
a
temporal
angelic
and
earthly
afterward
he
made
the
human
nature
composed
of
both
moreover
god
by
his
providence
protects
and
governs
all
things
reaching
from
end
to
end
mightily
and
ordering
all
things
harmoniously
every
thing
is
open
to
his
eyes
even
things
that
come
to
pass
by
the
free
action
of
his
creatures
of
the
holy
mother
church
holds
that
god
can
be
known
with
certainty
by
the
natural
light
of
human
reason
but
that
it
has
also
pleased
him
to
reveal
himself
and
the
eternal
decrees
of
his
will
in
a
supernatural
way
this
supernatural
revelation
as
declared
by
the
holy
council
of
trent
is
contained
in
the
books
of
the
old
and
new
testament
as
enumerated
in
the
decrees
of
that
council
and
as
are
to
be
had
in
the
old
vulgate
latin
edition
these
are
sacred
because
they
were
written
under
the
inspiration
of
the
holy
ghost
they
have
god
for
their
author
and
as
such
have
been
delivered
to
the
church
and
in
order
to
restrain
restless
spirits
who
may
give
erroneous
explanations
it
is
decreed
renewing
the
decision
of
the
council
of
trent
that
no
one
may
interpret
the
sacred
scriptures
contrary
to
the
sense
in
which
they
are
interpreted
by
holy
mother
church
to
whom
such
interpretation
belongs
of
inasmuch
as
man
depends
on
god
as
his
lord
and
created
reason
is
wholly
subject
to
uncreated
truth
he
is
bound
when
god
makes
a
revelation
to
obey
it
by
faith
this
faith
is
a
supernatural
virtue
and
the
beginning
of
man
salvation
who
believes
revealed
things
to
be
true
not
for
their
intrinsic
truth
as
seen
by
the
natural
light
of
reason
but
for
the
authority
of
god
in
revealing
them
but
nevertheless
that
faith
might
be
agreeable
to
reason
god
willed
to
join
miracles
and
prophecies
which
showing
forth
his
omnipotence
and
knowledge
are
proofs
suited
to
the
understanding
of
all
such
we
have
in
moses
and
the
prophets
and
above
all
in
christ
now
all
those
things
are
to
be
believed
which
are
written
in
the
word
of
god
or
handed
down
by
tradition
which
the
church
by
her
teaching
has
proposed
for
belief
no
one
can
be
justified
without
this
faith
nor
shall
any
one
unless
he
persevere
therein
to
the
end
attain
everlasting
life
hence
god
through
his
son
has
established
the
church
as
the
guardian
and
teacher
of
his
revealed
word
for
only
to
the
catholic
church
do
all
those
signs
belong
which
make
evident
the
credibility
of
the
christian
faith
nay
more
the
very
church
herself
in
view
of
her
wonderful
propagation
her
eminent
holiness
her
exhaustless
fruitfulness
in
all
that
is
good
her
catholic
unity
her
unshaken
stability
offers
a
great
and
evident
claim
to
belief
and
an
undeniable
proof
of
her
divine
mission
thus
the
church
shows
to
her
children
that
the
faith
they
hold
rests
on
a
most
solid
foundation
wherefore
totally
unlike
is
the
condition
of
those
who
by
the
heavenly
gift
of
faith
have
embraced
the
catholic
truth
and
of
those
who
led
by
human
opinions
are
following
a
false
religion
of
faith
and
moreover
the
catholic
church
has
ever
held
and
now
holds
that
there
exists
a
twofold
order
of
knowledge
each
of
which
is
distinct
from
the
other
both
as
to
its
principle
and
its
object
as
to
its
principle
because
in
the
one
we
know
by
natural
reason
in
the
other
by
divine
faith
as
to
the
object
because
besides
those
things
which
our
natural
reason
can
attain
there
are
proposed
to
our
belief
mysteries
hidden
in
god
which
unless
by
him
revealed
can
not
come
to
our
knowledge
reason
indeed
enlightened
by
faith
and
seeking
with
diligence
and
godly
sobriety
may
by
god
gift
come
to
some
understanding
limited
in
degree
but
most
wholesome
in
its
effects
of
mysteries
both
from
the
analogy
of
things
which
are
naturally
known
and
from
the
connection
of
the
mysteries
themselves
with
one
another
and
with
man
last
end
but
never
can
reason
be
rendered
capable
of
thoroughly
understanding
mysteries
as
it
does
those
truths
which
form
its
proper
object
for
god
mysteries
in
their
very
nature
so
far
surpass
the
reach
of
created
intellect
that
even
when
taught
by
revelation
and
received
by
faith
they
remain
covered
by
faith
itself
as
by
a
veil
and
shrouded
as
it
were
in
darkness
as
long
as
in
this
mortal
life
but
although
faith
be
above
reason
there
never
can
be
a
real
disagreement
between
them
since
the
same
god
who
reveals
mysteries
and
infuses
faith
has
given
man
soul
the
light
of
reason
and
god
can
not
deny
himself
nor
can
one
truth
ever
contradict
another
wherefore
the
empty
shadow
of
such
contradiction
arises
chiefly
from
this
that
either
the
doctrines
of
faith
are
not
understood
and
set
forth
as
the
church
really
holds
them
or
that
the
vain
devices
and
opinions
of
men
are
mistaken
for
the
dictates
of
reason
we
therefore
pronounce
false
every
assertion
which
is
contrary
to
the
enlightened
truth
of
faith
moreover
the
church
which
together
with
her
apostolic
office
of
teaching
is
charged
also
with
the
guardianship
of
the
deposits
of
faith
holds
likewise
from
god
the
right
and
the
duty
to
condemn
falsely
so
called
any
man
be
cheated
by
philosophy
and
vain
deceit
hence
all
the
christian
faithful
are
not
only
forbidden
to
defend
as
legitimate
conclusions
of
science
those
opinions
which
are
known
to
be
contrary
to
the
doctrine
of
faith
especially
when
condemned
by
the
church
but
are
rather
absolutely
bound
to
hold
them
for
errors
wearing
the
deceitful
appearance
of
truth
the
vatican
anathemas
not
only
is
it
impossible
for
faith
and
reason
ever
to
contradict
each
other
but
they
rather
afford
each
other
mutual
assistance
for
right
reason
establishes
the
foundation
of
faith
and
by
the
aid
of
its
light
cultivates
the
science
of
divine
things
and
faith
on
the
other
hand
frees
and
preserves
reason
from
errors
and
enriches
it
with
knowledge
of
many
kinds
so
far
then
is
the
church
from
opposing
the
culture
of
human
arts
and
sciences
that
she
rather
aids
and
promotes
it
in
many
ways
for
she
is
not
ignorant
of
nor
does
she
despise
the
advantages
which
flow
from
them
to
the
life
of
man
on
the
contrary
she
acknowledges
that
as
they
sprang
from
god
the
lord
of
knowledge
so
if
they
be
rightly
pursued
they
will
through
the
aid
of
his
grace
lead
to
god
nor
does
she
forbid
any
of
those
sciences
the
use
of
its
own
principles
and
its
own
method
within
its
own
proper
sphere
but
recognizing
this
reasonable
freedom
she
takes
care
that
they
may
not
by
contradicting
god
teaching
fall
into
errors
or
overstepping
the
due
limits
invade
or
throw
into
confusion
the
domain
of
faith
for
the
doctrine
of
faith
revealed
by
god
has
not
been
proposed
like
some
philosophical
discovery
to
be
made
perfect
by
human
ingenuity
but
it
has
been
delivered
to
the
spouse
of
christ
as
a
divine
deposit
to
be
faithfully
guarded
and
unerringly
set
forth
hence
all
tenets
of
holy
faith
are
to
be
explained
always
according
to
the
sense
and
meaning
of
the
church
nor
is
it
ever
lawful
to
depart
therefrom
under
pretense
or
color
of
a
more
enlightened
explanation
therefore
as
generations
and
centuries
roll
on
let
the
understanding
knowledge
and
wisdom
of
each
and
every
one
of
individuals
and
of
the
whole
church
grow
apace
and
increase
exceedingly
yet
only
in
its
kind
that
is
to
say
retaining
pure
and
inviolate
the
sense
and
meaning
and
belief
of
the
same
doctrine
among
other
canons
the
following
were
promulgated
let
him
be
anathema
who
denies
the
one
true
god
creator
and
lord
of
all
things
visible
and
invisible
who
unblushingly
affirms
that
besides
matter
nothing
else
exists
who
says
that
the
substance
or
essence
of
god
and
of
all
things
is
one
and
the
same
who
says
that
finite
things
both
corporeal
and
spiritual
or
at
least
spiritual
things
are
emanations
of
the
divine
substance
or
that
the
divine
essence
by
manifestation
or
development
of
itself
becomes
all
things
who
does
not
acknowledge
that
the
world
and
all
things
which
it
contains
were
produced
by
god
out
of
nothing
who
shall
say
that
man
can
and
ought
to
of
his
own
efforts
by
means
of
constant
progress
arrive
at
last
at
the
possession
of
all
truth
and
goodness
who
shall
refuse
to
receive
for
sacred
and
canonical
the
books
of
holy
scripture
in
their
integrity
with
all
their
parts
according
as
they
were
enumerated
by
the
holy
council
of
trent
or
shall
deny
that
they
are
inspired
by
god
who
shall
say
that
human
reason
is
in
such
wise
independent
that
faith
can
not
be
demanded
of
it
by
god
who
shall
say
that
divine
revelation
can
not
be
rendered
credible
by
external
evidences
who
shall
say
that
no
miracles
can
be
wrought
or
that
they
can
never
be
known
with
certainty
and
that
the
divine
origin
of
christianity
can
not
be
proved
by
them
who
shall
say
that
divine
revelation
includes
no
mysteries
but
that
all
the
dogmas
of
faith
may
be
understood
and
demonstrated
by
reason
duly
cultivated
who
shall
say
that
human
sciences
ought
to
be
pursued
in
such
a
spirit
of
freedom
that
one
may
be
allowed
to
hold
as
true
their
assertions
even
when
opposed
to
revealed
doctrine
who
shall
say
that
it
may
at
any
time
come
to
pass
in
the
progress
of
science
that
the
doctrines
set
forth
by
the
church
must
be
taken
in
another
sense
than
that
in
which
the
church
has
ever
received
and
yet
receives
them
the
evangelical
alliance
the
extraordinary
and
indeed
it
may
be
said
arrogant
assumptions
contained
in
these
decisions
were
far
from
being
received
with
satisfaction
by
educated
catholics
on
the
part
of
the
german
universities
there
was
resistance
and
when
at
the
close
of
the
year
the
decrees
of
the
vatican
council
were
generally
acquiesced
in
it
was
not
through
conviction
of
their
truth
but
through
a
disciplinary
sense
of
obedience
by
many
of
the
most
pious
catholics
the
entire
movement
and
the
results
to
which
it
had
led
were
looked
upon
with
the
sincerest
sorrow
pere
hyacinthe
in
a
letter
to
the
superior
of
his
order
says
i
protest
against
the
divorce
as
impious
as
it
is
insensate
sought
to
be
effected
between
the
church
which
is
our
eternal
mother
and
the
society
of
the
nineteenth
century
of
which
we
are
the
temporal
children
and
toward
which
we
have
also
duties
and
regards
it
is
my
most
profound
conviction
that
if
france
in
particular
and
the
latin
race
in
general
are
given
up
to
social
moral
and
religious
anarchy
the
principal
cause
undoubtedly
is
not
catholicism
itself
but
the
manner
in
which
catholicism
has
for
a
long
time
been
understood
and
practised
notwithstanding
his
infallibility
which
implies
omniscience
his
holiness
did
not
foresee
the
issue
of
the
war
had
the
prophetical
talent
been
vouchsafed
to
him
he
would
have
detected
the
inopportuneness
of
the
acts
of
his
council
his
request
to
the
king
of
prussia
for
military
aid
to
support
his
temporal
power
was
denied
the
excommunicated
king
of
italy
as
we
have
seen
took
possession
of
rome
a
bitter
papal
encyclical
strangely
contrasting
with
the
courteous
politeness
of
modern
was
issued
november
denouncing
the
acts
of
the
piedmontese
court
which
had
followed
the
counsel
of
the
sects
of
perdition
in
this
his
holiness
declares
that
he
is
in
captivity
and
that
he
will
have
no
agreement
with
belial
he
pronounces
the
greater
excommunication
with
censures
and
penalties
against
his
antagonists
and
prays
for
the
intercession
of
the
immaculate
virgin
mary
mother
of
god
and
that
of
the
blessed
apostles
peter
and
paul
of
the
various
protestant
denominations
several
had
associated
themselves
for
the
purposes
of
consultation
under
the
designation
of
the
evangelical
alliance
their
last
meeting
was
held
in
new
york
in
the
autumn
of
though
in
this
meeting
were
gathered
together
many
pious
representatives
of
the
reformed
churches
european
and
american
it
had
not
the
prestige
nor
the
authority
of
the
great
council
that
had
just
previously
closed
its
sessions
in
peters
at
rome
it
could
not
appeal
to
an
unbroken
ancestry
of
far
more
than
a
thousand
years
it
could
not
speak
with
the
authority
of
an
equal
and
indeed
of
a
superior
to
emperors
and
kings
while
profound
intelligence
and
a
statesmanlike
worldly
wisdom
gleamed
in
every
thing
that
the
vatican
council
had
done
the
evangelical
alliance
met
without
a
clear
and
precise
view
of
its
objects
without
any
intentions
its
wish
was
to
draw
into
closer
union
the
various
protestant
churches
but
it
had
no
hope
of
accomplishing
that
desirable
result
it
illustrated
the
necessary
working
of
the
principle
on
which
those
churches
originated
they
were
founded
on
dissent
and
exist
by
separation
yet
in
the
action
of
the
evangelical
alliance
may
be
discerned
certain
very
impressive
facts
it
averted
its
eyes
from
its
ancient
antagonist
that
antagonist
which
had
so
recently
loaded
the
reformation
with
contumely
and
denunciation
it
fastened
them
as
the
vatican
council
had
done
on
science
under
that
dreaded
name
there
stood
before
it
what
seemed
to
be
a
spectre
of
uncertain
form
of
proportions
of
threatening
aspect
sometimes
the
alliance
addressed
this
stupendous
apparition
in
words
of
courtesy
sometimes
in
tones
of
denunciation
the
vatican
constitution
criticised
the
alliance
failed
to
perceive
that
modern
science
is
the
legitimate
sister
indeed
it
is
the
of
the
reformation
they
were
begotten
together
and
were
born
together
it
failed
to
perceive
that
though
there
is
an
impossibility
of
bringing
into
coalition
the
many
conflicting
sects
they
may
all
find
in
science
a
point
of
connection
and
that
not
a
distrustful
attitude
toward
it
but
a
cordial
union
with
it
is
their
true
policy
it
remains
now
to
offer
some
reflections
on
this
constitution
of
the
catholic
faith
as
defined
by
the
vatican
council
for
objects
to
present
themselves
under
identical
relations
to
different
persons
they
must
be
seen
from
the
same
point
of
view
in
the
instance
we
are
now
considering
the
religious
man
has
his
own
especial
station
the
scientific
man
another
a
very
different
one
it
is
not
for
either
to
demand
that
his
shall
admit
that
the
panorama
of
facts
spread
before
them
is
actually
such
as
it
appears
to
him
to
be
the
dogmatic
constitution
insists
on
the
admission
of
this
postulate
that
the
roman
church
acts
under
a
divine
commission
specially
and
exclusively
delivered
to
it
in
virtue
of
that
great
authority
it
requires
of
all
men
the
surrender
of
their
intellectual
convictions
and
of
all
nations
the
subordination
of
their
civil
power
but
a
claim
so
imposing
must
be
substantiated
by
the
most
decisive
and
unimpeachable
credentials
proofs
not
only
of
an
implied
and
indirect
kind
but
clear
emphatic
and
to
the
point
proofs
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
call
in
question
the
church
however
declares
that
she
will
not
submit
her
claim
to
the
arbitrament
of
human
reason
she
demands
that
it
shall
be
at
once
conceded
as
an
article
of
faith
if
this
be
admitted
all
bar
requirements
must
necessarily
be
assented
to
no
matter
how
exorbitant
they
may
be
with
strange
inconsistency
the
dogmatic
constitution
deprecates
reason
affirming
that
it
can
not
determine
the
points
under
consideration
and
yet
submits
to
it
arguments
for
adjudication
in
truth
it
might
be
said
that
the
whole
composition
is
a
passionate
plea
to
reason
to
stultify
itself
in
favor
of
roman
christianity
with
points
of
view
so
widely
asunder
it
is
impossible
that
religion
and
science
should
accord
in
their
representation
of
things
nor
can
any
conclusion
in
common
be
reached
except
by
an
appeal
to
reason
as
a
supreme
and
final
judge
there
are
many
religions
in
the
world
some
of
them
of
more
venerable
antiquity
some
having
far
more
numerous
adherents
than
the
roman
how
can
a
selection
be
made
among
them
except
by
such
an
appeal
to
reason
religion
and
science
must
both
submit
their
claims
and
their
dissensions
to
its
arbitrament
against
this
the
vatican
council
protests
it
exalts
faith
to
a

reason

asserting

it

science
turns

on

not
a

in
the

on

she

whether
there
be
in

of

and
in
the
biography
of

any
thing
that
can
adequately
sustain

any
thing
that
can
justify
pontifical

or
extort
that
unhesitating
obedience
which
is
due
to
the
one
of
the
most
striking
and
yet
contradictory
features
of
the
dogmatic
constitution
is
the
reluctant
homage
it
pays
to
the
intelligence
of
man
it
presents
a
definition
of
the
philosophical
basis
of
catholicism
but
it
veils
from
view
the
repulsive
features
of
the
vulgar
faith
it
sets
forth
the
attributes
of
god
the
creator
of
all
things
in
words
fitly
designating
its
sublime
conception
but
it
abstains
from
affirming
that
this
most
awful
and
eternal
being
was
born
of
an
earthly
mother
the
wife
of
a
jewish
carpenter
who
has
since
become
the
queen
of
heaven
the
god
it
depicts
is
not
the
god
of
the
middle
ages
seated
on
his
golden
throne
surrounded
by
choirs
of
angels
but
the
god
of
philosophy
the
constitution
has
nothing
to
say
about
the
trinity
nothing
of
the
worship
due
to
the
virgin
on
the
contrary
that
is
by
implication
sternly
condemned
nothing
about
transubstantiation
or
the
making
of
the
flesh
and
blood
of
god
by
the
priest
nothing
of
the
invocation
of
the
saints
it
bears
on
its
face
subordination
to
the
thought
of
the
age
the
impress
of
the
intellectual
progress
of
man
the
passage
of
europe
to
llamaism
such
being
the
exposition
rendered
to
us
respecting
the
attributes
of
god
it
next
instructs
us
as
to
his
mode
of
government
of
the
world
the
church
asserts
that
she
possesses
a
supernatural
control
over
all
material
and
moral
events
the
priesthood
in
its
various
grades
can
determine
issues
of
the
future
either
by
the
exercise
of
its
inherent
attributes
or
by
its
influential
invocation
of
the
celestial
powers
to
the
sovereign
pontiff
it
has
been
given
to
bind
or
loose
at
his
pleasure
it
is
unlawful
to
appeal
from
his
judgments
to
an
oecumenical
council
as
if
to
an
earthly
arbiter
superior
to
him
powers
such
as
these
are
consistent
with
arbitrary
rule
but
they
are
inconsistent
with
the
government
of
the
world
by
immutable
law
hence
the
dogmatic
constitution
plants
itself
firmly
in
behalf
of
incessant
providential
interventions
it
will
not
for
a
moment
admit
that
in
natural
things
there
is
an
irresistible
sequence
of
events
or
in
the
affairs
of
men
an
unavoidable
course
of
acts
but
has
not
the
order
of
civilization
in
all
parts
of
the
world
been
the
same
does
not
the
growth
of
society
resemble
individual
growth
do
not
both
exhibit
to
us
phases
of
youth
of
maturity
of
decrepitude
to
a
person
who
has
carefully
considered
the
progressive
civilization
of
groups
of
men
in
regions
of
the
earth
far
apart
who
has
observed
the
identical
forms
under
which
that
advancing
civilization
has
manifested
itself
is
it
not
clear
that
the
procedure
is
determined
by
law
the
religious
ideas
of
the
incas
of
peru
and
the
emperors
of
mexico
and
the
ceremonials
of
their
were
the
same
as
those
in
europe
the
same
as
those
in
asia
the
current
of
thought
had
been
the
same
a
swarm
of
bees
carried
to
some
distant
land
will
build
its
combs
and
regulate
its
social
institutions
as
other
unknown
swarms
would
do
and
so
with
separated
and
disconnected
swarms
of
men
so
invariable
is
this
sequence
of
thought
and
act
that
there
are
philosophers
who
transferring
the
past
example
offered
by
asiatic
history
to
the
case
of
europe
would
not
hesitate
to
sustain
the
proposition
given
a
bishop
of
rome
and
some
centuries
and
you
will
have
an
infallible
pope
given
an
infallible
pope
and
a
little
more
time
and
you
will
have
llamaism
llamaism
to
which
asia
has
long
ago
attained
as
to
the
origin
of
corporeal
and
spiritual
things
the
dogmatic
constitution
adds
a
solemn
emphasis
to
its
declarations
by
anathematizing
all
those
who
hold
the
doctrine
of
emanation
or
who
believe
that
visible
nature
is
only
a
manifestation
of
the
divine
essence
in
this
its
authors
had
a
task
of
no
ordinary
difficulty
before
them
they
must
encounter
those
formidable
ideas
whether
old
or
new
which
in
our
times
are
so
strongly
forcing
themselves
on
thoughtful
men
the
doctrine
of
the
conservation
and
correlation
of
force
yields
as
its
logical
issue
the
oriental
emanation
theory
the
doctrines
of
evolution
and
development
strike
at
that
of
successive
creative
acts
the
former
rests
on
the
fundamental
principle
that
the
quantity
of
force
in
the
universe
is
invariable
though
that
quantity
can
neither
be
increased
nor
diminished
the
forms
under
which
force
expresses
itself
may
be
transmuted
into
each
other
as
yet
this
doctrine
has
not
received
complete
scientific
demonstration
but
so
numerous
and
so
cogent
are
the
arguments
adduced
in
its
behalf
that
it
stands
in
an
imposing
almost
in
an
authoritative
attitude
now
the
asiatic
theory
of
emanation
and
absorption
is
seen
to
be
in
harmony
with
this
grand
idea
it
does
not
hold
that
at
the
conception
of
a
human
being
a
soul
is
created
by
god
out
of
nothing
and
given
to
it
but
that
a
portion
of
the
already
existing
the
divine
the
universal
intelligence
is
imparted
and
when
life
is
over
this
returns
to
and
is
absorbed
in
the
general
source
from
which
it
originally
came
the
authors
of
the
constitution
forbid
these
ideas
to
be
held
under
pain
of
eternal
punishment
in
like
manner
they
dispose
of
the
doctrines
of
evolution
and
development
bluntly
insisting
that
the
church
believes
in
distinct
creative
acts
the
doctrine
that
every
living
form
is
derived
from
some
preceding
form
is
scientifically
in
a
much
more
advanced
position
than
that
concerning
force
and
probably
may
be
considered
as
established
whatever
may
become
of
the
additions
with
which
it
has
recently
been
overlaid
in
her
condemnation
of
the
reformation
the
church
carries
into
effect
her
ideas
of
the
subordination
of
reason
to
faith
in
her
eyes
the
reformation
is
an
impious
heresy
leading
to
the
abyss
of
pantheism
materialism
and
atheism
and
tending
to
overthrow
the
very
foundations
of
human
society
she
therefore
would
restrain
those
restless
spirits
who
following
luther
have
upheld
the
right
of
every
man
to
interpret
the
scriptures
for
himself
she
asserts
that
it
is
a
wicked
error
to
admit
protestants
to
equal
political
privileges
with
catholics
and
that
to
coerce
them
and
suppress
them
is
a
sacred
duty
that
it
is
abominable
to
permit
them
to
establish
educational
institutions
gregory
xvi
denounced
freedom
of
conscience
as
an
insane
folly
and
the
freedom
of
the
press
a
pestilent
error
which
can
not
be
sufficiently
detested
but
how
is
it
possible
to
recognize
an
inspired
and
infallible
oracle
on
the
tiber
when
it
is
remembered
that
again
and
again
successive
popes
have
contradicted
each
other
that
popes
have
denounced
councils
and
councils
have
denounced
popes
that
the
bible
of
sixtus
had
so
many
admitted
errors
nearly
two
thousand
that
its
own
authors
had
to
recall
it
how
is
it
possible
for
the
children
of
the
church
to
regard
as
delusive
errors
the
globular
form
of
the
earth
her
position
as
a
planet
in
the
solar
system
her
rotation
on
her
axis
her
movement
round
the
sun
how
can
they
deny
that
there
are
antipodes
and
other
worlds
than
ours
how
can
they
believe
that
the
world
was
made
out
of
nothing
completed
in
a
week
finished
just
as
we
see
it
now
that
it
has
undergone
no
change
but
that
its
parts
have
worked
so
indifferently
as
to
require
incessant
interventions
the
errors
of
ecclesiasticism
when
science
is
thus
commanded
to
surrender
her
intellectual
convictions
may
she
not
ask
the
ecclesiastic
to
remember
the
past
the
contest
respecting
the
figure
of
the
earth
and
the
location
of
heaven
and
hell
ended
adversely
to
him
he
affirmed
that
the
earth
is
an
extended
plane
and
that
the
sky
is
a
firmament
the
floor
of
heaven
through
which
again
and
again
persons
have
been
seen
to
ascend
the
globular
form
demonstrated
beyond
any
possibility
of
contradiction
by
astronomical
facts
and
by
the
voyage
of
ship
he
then
maintained
that
it
is
the
central
body
of
the
universe
all
others
being
in
subordination
to
it
and
it
the
grand
object
of
god
regard
forced
from
this
position
he
next
affirmed
that
it
is
motionless
the
sun
and
the
stars
actually
revolving
as
they
apparently
do
around
it
the
invention
of
the
telescope
proved
that
here
again
he
was
in
error
then
he
maintained
that
all
the
motions
of
the
solar
system
are
regulated
by
providential
intervention
the
principia
of
newton
demonstrated
that
they
are
due
to
irresistible
law
he
then
affirmed
that
the
earth
and
all
the
celestial
bodies
were
created
about
six
thousand
years
ago
and
that
in
six
days
the
order
of
nature
was
settled
and
plants
and
animals
in
their
various
tribes
introduced
constrained
by
the
accumulating
mass
of
adverse
evidence
he
enlarged
his
days
into
periods
of
indefinite
length
only
however
to
find
that
even
this
device
was
inadequate
the
six
ages
with
their
six
special
creations
could
no
longer
be
maintained
when
it
was
discovered
that
species
slowly
emerged
in
one
age
reached
a
culmination
in
a
second
and
gradually
died
out
in
a
third
this
overlapping
from
age
to
age
would
not
only
have
demanded
creations
but
also
he
affirmed
that
there
had
been
a
deluge
which
covered
the
whole
earth
above
the
tops
of
the
highest
mountains
and
that
the
waters
of
this
flood
were
removed
by
a
wind
correct
ideas
respecting
the
dimensions
of
the
atmosphere
and
of
the
sea
and
of
the
operation
of
evaporation
proved
how
untenable
these
statements
are
of
the
progenitors
of
the
human
race
he
declared
that
they
had
come
from
their
maker
hand
perfect
both
in
body
and
mind
and
had
subsequently
experienced
a
fall
he
is
now
considering
how
best
to
dispose
of
the
evidence
continually
accumulating
respecting
the
savage
condition
of
prehistoric
man
is
it
at
all
surprising
that
the
number
of
those
who
hold
the
opinions
of
the
church
in
light
esteem
should
so
rapidly
increase
how
can
that
be
received
as
a
trustworthy
guide
in
the
invisible
which
falls
into
so
many
errors
in
the
visible
how
can
that
give
confidence
in
the
moral
the
spiritual
which
has
so
signally
failed
in
the
physical
it
is
not
possible
to
dispose
of
these
conflicting
facts
as
empty
shadows
vain
devices
fictions
coming
from
knowledge
falsely
so
called
errors
wearing
the
deceitful
appearance
of
truth
as
the
church
stigmatizes
them
on
the
contrary
they
are
stern
witnesses
bearing
emphatic
and
unimpeachable
testimony
against
the
ecclesiastical
claim
to
infallibility
and
fastening
a
conviction
of
ignorance
and
blindness
upon
her
convicted
of
so
many
errors
the
papacy
makes
no
attempt
at
explanation
it
ignores
the
whole
matter
nay
more
relying
on
the
efficacy
of
audacity
though
confronted
by
these
facts
it
lays
claim
to
infallibility
separation
of
catholicism
and
civilization
but
to
the
pontiff
no
other
rights
can
be
conceded
than
those
he
can
establish
at
the
bar
of
reason
he
can
not
claim
infallibility
in
religious
affairs
and
decline
it
in
scientific
infallibility
embraces
all
things
it
implies
omniscience
if
it
holds
good
for
theology
it
necessarily
holds
good
for
science
how
is
it
possible
to
coordinate
the
infallibility
of
the
papacy
with
the
errors
into
which
it
has
fallen
does
it
not
then
become
needful
to
reject
the
claim
of
the
papacy
to
the
employment
of
coercion
in
the
maintenance
of
its
opinions
to
repudiate
utterly
the
declaration
that
the
inquisition
is
an
urgent
necessity
in
view
of
the
unbelief
of
the
present
age
and
in
the
name
of
human
nature
to
protest
loudly
against
the
ferocity
and
terrorism
of
that
institution
has
not
conscience
inalienable
rights
an
impassable
and
gulf
intervenes
between
catholicism
and
the
spirit
of
the
age
catholicism
insists
that
blind
faith
is
superior
to
reason
that
mysteries
are
of
more
importance
than
facts
she
claims
to
be
the
sole
interpreter
of
nature
and
revelation
the
supreme
arbiter
of
knowledge
she
summarily
rejects
all
modern
criticism
of
the
scriptures
and
orders
the
bible
to
be
accepted
in
accordance
with
the
views
of
the
theologians
of
trent
she
openly
avows
her
hatred
of
free
institutions
and
constitutional
systems
and
declares
that
those
are
in
damnable
error
who
regard
the
reconciliation
of
the
pope
with
modern
civilization
as
either
possible
or
desirable
science
and
protestantism
but
the
spirit
of
the
age
demands
is
the
human
intellect
to
be
subordinated
to
the
tridentine
fathers
or
to
the
fancy
of
illiterate
and
uncritical
persons
who
wrote
in
the
earlier
ages
of
the
church
it
sees
no
merit
in
blind
faith
but
rather
distrusts
it
it
looks
forward
to
an
improvement
in
the
popular
canon
of
credibility
for
a
decision
between
fact
and
fiction
it
does
not
consider
itself
bound
to
believe
fables
and
falsehoods
that
have
been
invented
for
ecclesiastical
ends
it
finds
no
argument
in
behalf
of
their
truth
that
traditions
and
legends
have
been
in
this
respect
those
of
the
church
are
greatly
inferior
to
the
fables
of
paganism
the
longevity
of
the
church
itself
is
not
due
to
divine
protection
or
intervention
but
to
the
skill
with
which
it
has
adapted
its
policy
to
existing
circumstances
if
antiquity
be
the
criterion
of
authenticity
the
claims
of
buddhism
must
be
respected
it
has
the
superior
warrant
of
many
centuries
there
can
be
no
defense
of
those
deliberate
falsifications
of
history
that
concealment
of
historical
facts
of
which
the
church
has
so
often
taken
advantage
in
these
things
the
end
does
not
justify
the
means
then
has
it
in
truth
come
to
this
that
roman
christianity
and
science
are
recognized
by
their
respective
adherents
as
being
absolutely
incompatible
they
can
not
exist
together
one
must
yield
to
the
other
mankind
must
make
its
choice
it
can
not
have
both
science
and
faith
while
such
is
perhaps
the
issue
as
regards
catholicism
a
reconciliation
of
the
reformation
with
science
is
not
only
possible
but
would
easily
take
place
if
the
protestant
churches
would
only
live
up
to
the
maxim
taught
by
luther
and
established
by
so
many
years
of
war
that
maxim
is
the
right
of
private
interpretation
of
the
scriptures
it
was
the
foundation
of
intellectual
liberty
but
if
a
personal
interpretation
of
the
book
of
revelation
is
permissible
how
can
it
be
denied
in
the
case
of
the
book
of
nature
in
the
misunderstandings
that
have
taken
place
we
must
ever
bear
in
mind
the
infirmities
of
men
the
generations
that
immediately
followed
the
reformation
may
perhaps
be
excused
for
not
comprehending
the
full
significance
of
their
cardinal
principle
and
for
not
on
all
occasions
carrying
it
into
effect
when
calvin
caused
servetus
to
be
burnt
he
was
animated
not
by
the
principles
of
the
reformation
but
by
those
of
catholicism
from
which
he
had
not
been
able
to
emancipate
himself
completely
and
when
the
clergy
of
influential
protestant
confessions
have
stigmatized
the
investigators
of
nature
as
infidels
and
atheists
the
same
may
be
said
for
catholicism
to
reconcile
itself
to
science
there
are
formidable
perhaps
insuperable
obstacles
in
the
way
for
protestantism
to
achieve
that
great
result
there
are
not
in
the
one
case
there
is
a
bitter
a
mortal
animosity
to
be
overcome
in
the
other
a
friendship
that
misunderstandings
have
alienated
to
be
restored
civilization
and
religion
but
whatever
may
be
the
preparatory
incidents
of
that
great
impending
intellectual
crisis
which
christendom
must
soon
inevitably
witness
of
this
we
may
rest
assured
that
the
silent
secession
from
the
public
faith
which
in
so
ominous
a
manner
characterizes
the
present
generation
will
find
at
length
political
expression
it
is
not
without
significance
that
france
reenforces
the
ultramontane
tendencies
of
her
lower
population
by
the
promotion
of
pilgrimages
the
perpetration
of
miracles
the
exhibition
of
celestial
apparitions
constrained
to
do
this
by
her
destiny
she
does
it
with
a
blush
it
is
not
without
significance
that
germany
resolves
to
rid
herself
of
the
incubus
of
a
dual
government
by
the
exclusion
of
the
italian
element
and
to
carry
to
its
completion
that
reformation
which
three
centuries
ago
she
left
unfinished
the
time
approaches
when
men
must
take
their
choice
between
quiescent
immobile
faith
and
science
faith
with
its
mediaeval
consolations
science
which
is
incessantly
scattering
its
material
blessings
in
the
pathway
of
life
elevating
the
lot
of
man
in
this
world
and
unifying
the
human
race
its
triumphs
are
solid
and
enduring
but
the
glory
which
catholicism
might
gain
from
a
conflict
with
material
ideas
is
at
the
best
only
like
that
of
other
celestial
meteors
when
they
touch
the
atmosphere
of
the
earth
transitory
and
useless
though
guizot
affirmation
that
the
church
has
always
sided
with
despotism
is
only
too
true
it
must
be
remembered
that
in
the
policy
she
follows
there
is
much
of
political
necessity
she
is
urged
on
by
the
pressure
of
nineteen
centuries
but
if
the
irresistible
indicates
itself
in
her
action
the
inevitable
manifests
itself
in
her
life
for
it
is
with
the
papacy
as
with
a
man
it
has
passed
through
the
struggles
of
infancy
it
has
displayed
the
energies
of
maturity
and
its
work
completed
it
must
sink
into
the
feebleness
and
querulousness
of
old
age
its
youth
can
never
be
renewed
the
influence
of
its
souvenirs
alone
will
remain
as
pagan
rome
threw
her
departing
shadow
over
the
empire
and
tinctured
all
its
thoughts
so
christian
rome
casts
her
parting
shadow
over
europe
inadmissible
claims
of
catholicism
will
modern
civilization
consent
to
abandon
the
career
of
advancement
which
has
given
it
so
much
power
and
happiness
will
it
consent
to
retrace
its
steps
to
the
ignorance
and
superstition
of
the
middle
ages
will
it
submit
to
the
dictation
of
a
power
which
claiming
divine
authority
can
present
no
adequate
credentials
of
its
office
a
power
which
kept
europe
in
a
stagnant
condition
for
many
centuries
ferociously
suppressing
by
the
stake
and
the
sword
every
attempt
at
progress
a
power
that
is
founded
in
a
cloud
of
mysteries
that
sets
itself
above
reason
and
that
loudly
proclaims
the
hatred
it
entertains
against
liberty
of
thought
and
freedom
in
civil
institutions
that
professes
its
intention
of
repressing
the
one
and
destroying
the
other
whenever
it
can
find
the
opportunity
that
denounces
as
most
pernicious
and
insane
the
opinion
that
liberty
of
conscience
and
of
worship
is
the
right
of
every
man
that
protests
against
that
right
being
proclaimed
and
asserted
by
law
in
every
state
that
contemptuously
repudiates
the
principle
that
the
will
of
the
people
manifested
by
public
opinion
as
it
is
called
or
by
other
means
shall
constitute
law
that
refuses
to
every
man
any
title
to
opinion
in
matters
of
religion
but
holds
that
it
is
simply
his
duty
to
believe
what
he
is
told
by
the
church
and
to
obey
her
commands
that
will
not
permit
any
temporal
government
to
define
the
rights
and
prescribe
limits
to
the
authority
of
the
church
that
declares
it
not
only
may
but
will
resort
to
force
to
discipline
disobedient
individuals
that
invades
the
sanctify
of
private
life
by
making
at
the
confessional
the
wife
and
daughters
and
servants
of
one
suspected
spies
and
informers
against
him
that
tries
him
without
an
accuser
and
by
torture
makes
him
bear
witness
against
himself
that
denies
the
right
of
parents
to
educate
their
children
outside
of
its
own
church
and
insists
that
to
it
alone
belongs
the
supervision
of
domestic
life
and
the
control
of
marriages
and
divorces
that
denounces
the
impudence
of
those
who
presume
to
subordinate
the
authority
of
the
church
to
the
civil
authority
or
who
advocate
the
separation
of
the
church
from
the
state
that
absolutely
repudiates
all
toleration
and
affirms
that
the
catholic
religion
is
entitled
to
be
held
as
the
only
religion
in
every
country
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
modes
of
worship
that
requires
all
laws
standing
in
the
way
of
its
interests
to
be
repealed
and
if
that
be
refused
orders
all
its
followers
to
disobey
them
issue
of
the
conflict
this
power
conscious
that
it
can
work
no
miracle
to
serve
itself
does
not
hesitate
to
disturb
society
by
its
intrigues
against
governments
and
seeks
to
accomplish
its
ends
by
alliances
with
despotism
claims
such
as
these
mean
a
revolt
against
modern
civilization
an
intention
of
destroying
it
no
matter
at
what
social
cost
to
submit
to
them
without
resistance
men
must
be
slaves
indeed
as
to
the
issue
of
the
coming
conflict
can
any
one
doubt
whatever
is
resting
on
fiction
and
fraud
will
be
overthrown
institutions
that
organize
impostures
and
spread
delusions
must
show
what
right
they
have
to
exist
faith
must
render
an
account
of
herself
to
reason
mysteries
must
give
place
to
facts
religion
must
relinquish
that
imperious
that
domineering
position
which
she
has
so
long
maintained
against
science
there
must
be
absolute
freedom
for
thought
the
ecclesiastic
must
learn
to
keep
himself
within
the
domain
he
has
chosen
and
cease
to
tyrannize
over
the
philosopher
who
conscious
of
his
own
strength
and
the
purity
of
his
motives
will
bear
such
interference
no
longer
what
was
written
by
esdras
near
the
rivers
of
babylon
more
than
centuries
ago
still
holds
good
as
for
truth
it
endureth
and
is
always
strong
it
liveth
and
conquereth
for
evermore
