preface
murray
youthful
modesty
insists
that
his
study
of
pragmatism
needs
a
sponsor
this
is
not
at
all
my
own
opinion
but
i
may
take
the
opportunity
of
pointing
out
how
singularly
qualified
he
is
to
give
a
good
account
of
it
in
the
first
place
he
is
young
and
youth
is
an
almost
indispensable
qualification
for
the
appreciation
of
novelty
for
the
mind
works
more
and
more
stiffly
as
it
grows
older
and
becomes
less
and
less
capable
of
absorbing
what
is
new
hence
if
our
authorities
lived
for
ever
they
would
become
complete
this
is
the
justification
of
death
from
the
standpoint
of
social
progress
and
as
there
is
no
subject
in
which
is
more
rampant
than
in
philosophy
a
youthful
and
nimble
mind
is
here
particularly
needed
it
has
given
murray
an
eye
also
to
the
varieties
of
pragmatism
and
to
their
connections
secondly
murray
has
like
myself
enjoyed
the
advantage
of
a
severely
intellectualistic
training
in
the
classical
philosophy
of
oxford
university
and
in
its
premier
college
balliol
the
aim
of
this
training
is
to
instil
into
the
best
minds
the
country
produces
an
adamantine
conviction
that
philosophy
has
made
no
progress
since
aristotle
it
costs
about
a
year
but
on
the
whole
it
is
singularly
successful
its
effect
upon
capable
minds
possessed
of
common
sense
is
to
produce
that
contempt
for
pure
intellect
which
distinguishes
the
british
nation
from
all
others
and
ensures
the
practical
success
of
administrators
selected
by
an
examination
so
gloriously
irrelevant
to
their
future
duties
that
since
the
lamentable
demise
of
the
chinese
system
it
may
boast
to
be
the
most
antiquated
in
the
world
in
minds
however
which
are
more
prone
to
theorizing
but
at
the
same
time
this
training
produces
a
keenness
of
insight
into
the
defects
of
intellectualism
and
a
perception
of
the
of
pragmatism
which
can
probably
be
reached
in
no
other
way
murray
therefore
is
quite
right
in
emphasizing
above
all
the
services
of
pragmatism
as
a
rigorously
critical
theory
of
knowledge
and
in
refuting
the
amiable
delusion
of
many
pedants
that
pragmatism
is
merely
an
emotional
revolt
against
the
rigors
of
logic
it
is
essentially
a
reform
of
logic
which
protests
against
a
logic
that
has
become
so
formal
as
to
abstract
from
meaning
altogether
thirdly
an
elementary
introduction
to
pragmatism
was
greatly
needed
less
because
the
subject
is
inherently
difficult
than
because
it
has
become
so
deeply
involved
in
philosophic
controversy
intrinsically
it
should
be
as
easy
to
make
philosophy
intelligible
as
any
other
subject
the
exposition
of
a
truth
is
difficult
only
to
those
who
have
not
understood
it
or
do
not
desire
to
reveal
it
but
british
philosophy
had
long
become
almost
as
open
as
german
to
the
german
gibe
that
is
nothing
but
the
systematic
misuse
of
a
terminology
invented
expressly
for
this
purpose
and
pragmatism
too
could
obtain
a
hearing
only
by
showing
that
it
could
parley
with
its
foes
in
the
technical
language
of
kant
and
hegel
hence
it
had
no
leisure
to
compose
a
fitting
introduction
to
itself
for
students
of
philosophy
william
james
great
as
it
is
as
a
work
of
genius
brilliant
as
it
is
as
a
contribution
to
literature
was
intended
mainly
for
the
man
in
the
street
it
is
so
lacking
in
the
familiar
philosophic
catchwords
that
it
may
be
doubted
whether
any
professor
has
quite
understood
it
and
moreover
it
was
written
some
years
ago
and
no
longer
covers
the
whole
ground
the
other
writings
of
the
pragmatists
have
all
been
too
controversial
and
technical
the
critics
of
pragmatism
have
produced
only
caricatures
so
gross
as
to
be
unrecognizable
and
so
obscure
as
to
be
unintelligible
little
book
alone
may
claim
to
be
within
its
limits
a
complete
survey
of
the
field
simply
worded
and
yet
not
unmindful
of
due
technicality
it
is
also
up
to
date
though
in
dealing
with
so
progressive
a
subject
it
is
impossible
to
say
how
long
it
is
destined
to
remain
so
schiller
chapter
i
the
genesis
of
pragmatism
there
is
a
curious
impression
in
the
world
of
thought
that
pragmatism
is
the
most
audacious
of
philosophic
novelties
the
most
anarchical
transvaluation
of
all
respectable
traditions
sometimes
it
is
pictured
as
an
insurgence
of
emotion
against
logic
sometimes
as
an
assault
of
theology
upon
the
integrity
of
pure
reason
one
day
it
is
described
as
the
reckless
theorizing
of
dilettanti
whose
knowledge
of
philosophy
is
too
superficial
to
require
refutation
the
next
as
a
transatlantic
importation
of
the
debasing
slang
of
the
wild
west
abroad
it
is
frequently
denounced
as
an
outbreak
of
the
sordid
commercialism
of
the
mind
all
these
ideas
are
mistaken
pragmatism
is
neither
a
revolt
against
philosophy
nor
a
revolution
in
philosophy
except
in
so
far
as
it
is
an
important
evolution
of
philosophy
it
is
a
collective
name
for
the
most
modern
solution
of
puzzles
which
have
impeded
philosophical
progress
from
time
immemorial
and
it
has
arisen
naturally
in
the
course
of
philosophical
reflection
it
answers
the
big
problems
which
are
as
familiar
to
the
scientist
and
the
theologian
as
to
the
metaphysician
and
epistemologist
and
which
are
both
intelligible
and
interesting
to
common
sense
the
following
questions
stand
out
can
the
possibility
of
knowledge
be
maintained
against
hume
and
other
sceptics
certainly
if
it
can
be
shown
that
new
psychology
has
antiquated
the
analysis
of
mind
which
hume
assumed
and
associationism
respectfully
continued
to
uphold
seeing
that
inclination
and
volition
indisputably
play
a
part
in
the
of
all
beliefs
scientific
and
religious
what
is
the
logical
significance
of
this
fact
this
yields
the
problem
will
to
believe
and
more
generally
of
place
of
will
in
cognition
is
there
no
criterion
by
which
the
divergent
claims
of
rival
creeds
and
philosophies
to
be
possessed
of
unconditional
truth
can
be
scientifically
tested
the
sceptic
sneer
that
the
shifting
systems
of
philosophy
illustrate
only
the
changing
fashions
of
a
great
illusion
about
man
capacity
for
truth
plunges
dogmatism
into
a
from
which
it
can
emerge
only
by
finding
a
way
of
discriminating
a
from
an
and
so
solving
the
of
truth
and
error
the
weird
verbalism
of
the
traditional
logic
suggests
a
problem
which
strikes
deeper
even
than
the
question
you
mean
by
truth
viz
you
mean
anything
and
so
the
of
meaning
is
propounded
by
the
failure
of
formal
logic
is
logic
not
concerned
at
all
with
is
it
only
juggling
with
empty
forms
of
words
lastly
if
from
all
this
there
springs
up
a
conviction
of
bankruptcy
of
intellectualism
the
question
suggests
itself
whether
the
relation
between
abstract
thinking
and
concrete
experience
between
and
has
been
rightly
grasped
is
life
worth
living
only
for
the
sake
of
philosophic
contemplation
or
is
thinking
only
worth
doing
to
aid
us
in
the
struggle
for
life
are
and
two
separate
kingdoms
with
rigid
frontiers
strictly
guarded
or
does
it
appear
that
theories
which
can
not
be
applied
have
in
the
end
neither
worth
nor
truth
nor
even
meaning
it
is
plain
from
this
catalogue
of
inquiries
that
pragmatism
makes
no
abrupt
breach
in
tradition
it
is
not
the
of
philosophy
it
does
not
wipe
out
the
history
of
speculation
in
order
to
announce
a
millennium
of
new
ideas
it
claims
on
the
contrary
to
be
the
culmination
and
of
that
history
it
can
not
rightly
be
represented
as
trying
either
to
sell
new
lamps
for
old
or
to
a
new
metaphysical
system
on
the
ruins
of
all
previous
achievements
its
real
task
is
singularly
modest
it
aims
merely
at
instructing
in
the
elementary
laws
which
condition
the
stability
of
such
structures
and
conduce
to
their
conservation
it
is
therefore
a
grave
mistake
to
regard
it
as
a
parochial
eccentricity
as
a
specific
americanism
nor
is
it
the
product
of
the
misplaced
ingenuity
of
individual
it
has
come
into
being
by
the
of
distinct
lines
of
thought
pursued
in
different
countries
by
different
thinkers
one
of
the
most
interesting
of
these
has
originated
in
the
scientific
world
the
immense
growth
of
scientific
knowledge
during
the
last
century
was
bound
to
react
on
human
conceptions
of
scientific
procedure
the
enormous
number
of
new
facts
brought
to
light
by
manipulating
hypotheses
could
not
but
modify
our
view
of
scientific
law
laws
no
longer
seem
to
scientists
the
immutable
foundations
of
an
eternal
order
but
are
inevitably
treated
as
formulae
for
grouping
and
predicting
the
events
which
verify
them
the
labours
of
physicists
like
mach
duhem
and
ostwald
point
to
alternative
formulations
of
new
hypotheses
for
the
best
established
laws
the
physics
of
newton
are
no
longer
final
and
the
notion
of
is
a
dangerous
rival
to
the
older
conception
of
it
is
of
course
indifferent
to
the
philosopher
whether
the
new
physics
are
successful
in
superseding
the
old
or
not
what
it
concerns
him
to
note
is
that
dogmatic
confidence
in
the
finality
of
scientific
laws
has
given
place
to
a
belief
that
our
laws
are
only
working
formulae
for
scientific
purposes
and
that
no
science
can
truly
boast
of
having
read
off
the
mind
of
the
deity
as
sir
thomson
neatly
puts
it
a
scientific
theory
for
the
enlightened
modern
scientist
is
a
and
not
a
creed
science
has
become
content
to
be
only
conceptual
shorthand
provided
that
its
message
be
humanly
intelligible
it
no
longer
claims
truth
because
abstractly
and
absolutely
it
with
nature
but
because
it
yields
a
convenient
means
of
mastering
the
flux
of
events
even
mathematics
long
the
pattern
of
absolute
knowledge
has
not
escaped
the
stigma
of
relativity
have
been
invented
by
riemann
and
lobatschewski
as
rivals
to
the
assumptions
of
euclid
and
the
brilliant
writings
of
poincar√©
have
explained
the
human
devices
on
which
mathematical
concepts
rest
euclidean
geometry
is
reduced
to
a
useful
interpretation
of
the
data
of
experience
it
is
not
theoretically
the
only
one
its
superior
validity
is
dependent
upon
its
use
when
applied
to
the
physical
world
even
mathematics
therefore
lend
themselves
to
the
philosophic
inference
drawn
by
henri
bergson
and
others
that
all
conceptual
systems
of
the
human
mind
have
a
merely
conditional
truth
depending
on
the
circumstances
of
their
application
another
of
pragmatic
philosophy
has
been
darwinism
indeed
the
pragmatic
is
the
only
philosophizing
which
has
completely
assimilated
evolution
the
insight
into
the
real
fluidity
of
natural
species
ought
long
ago
to
have
toned
down
the
artificial
rigidity
of
logical
classifications
to
know
reality
man
can
no
longer
rest
in
a
contemplation
of
a
static
system
he
must
expand
his
thoughts
so
as
to
cope
with
a
perpetually
changing
process
since
the
world
changes
his
must
change
to
fit
it
he
is
faced
with
the
necessity
of
a
continuous
reconstruction
of
beliefs
this
influence
of
darwin
has
inspired
the
logical
theories
of
professor
dewey
and
the
school
of
pragmatists
thought
in
their
writings
is
essentially
the
instrument
of
this
readjustment
its
function
is
to
effect
the
necessary
changes
in
beliefs
as
economically
and
usefully
as
possible
it
is
an
evolving
process
which
keeps
pace
with
the
evolution
of
reality
and
the
changing
situations
of
mortal
life
it
is
not
however
entirely
the
reaction
of
science
upon
philosophy
which
has
given
birth
to
pragmatism
philosophy
itself
has
been
rent
by
internal
convulsions
these
have
been
emphasized
in
the
work
of
schiller
who
has
shown
that
already
in
the
days
of
plato
the
distinction
between
and
was
baffling
philosophy
that
plato
has
failed
to
establish
it
and
that
the
famous
dictum
of
protagoras
is
the
measure
of
all
things
distinctly
foreshadows
the
or
as
he
calls
it
the
solution
of
the
difficulty
elsewhere
schiller
has
commented
on
the
controversies
raised
by
hume
criticism
of
dogmatism
he
has
shown
that
kant
failed
to
answer
hume
because
he
accepted
hume
psychology
and
that
no
philosophers
have
since
been
able
to
devise
any
consistent
and
tenable
doctrine
the
idealistic
theories
of
the
reveal
their
futility
by
their
want
of
application
to
the
genuine
problems
of
life
and
by
the
theoretic
agnosticism
from
which
they
can
not
escape
hence
the
need
for
a
new
theory
of
knowledge
and
a
thorough
reform
of
logic
at
this
point
he
joins
forces
with
alfred
sidgwick
who
has
long
been
urging
a
radical
criticism
of
the
procedures
of
formal
logic
and
shown
the
gulf
between
them
and
the
processes
of
concrete
thought
sidgwick
has
demonstrated
that
the
belief
in
formal
truth
renders
logic
merely
verbal
and
that
the
actual
of
assertions
completely
escapes
it
the
most
sensational
approach
to
pragmatism
however
is
that
from
the
side
of
religion
the
pragmatic
method
of
deciding
religious
problems
which
asserts
the
legitimacy
of
a
that
precedes
knowledge
has
always
been
more
or
less
consciously
practised
by
the
religious
it
is
brilliantly
advocated
in
the
of
pascal
and
clearly
and
forcibly
defended
in
that
most
remarkable
essay
in
unprofessional
philosophy
cardinal
newman
of
this
line
of
reasoning
however
is
most
familiarly
associated
with
the
name
of
william
james
he
first
illustrated
the
pragmatic
method
by
a
famous
paper
for
a
theological
audience
on
will
to
believe
and
founded
the
psychological
study
of
religious
experience
in
his
gifford
lectures
on
varieties
of
religious
this
brings
us
to
the
last
and
historically
the
most
fertile
of
the
sources
of
pragmatism
psychology
the
publication
in
of
great
of
opened
a
new
era
in
the
history
of
that
science
more
than
that
it
was
destined
in
the
long
run
to
work
a
transformation
in
philosophy
as
a
whole
by
introducing
into
it
those
biological
and
voluntaristic
principles
to
which
he
afterwards
applied
the
generic
name
of
pragmatism
or
philosophy
of
action
we
must
pass
then
to
consider
the
new
psychology
of
william
james
chapter
ii
the
new
psychology
until
the
year
when
james
were
published
the
psychology
of
hume
reigned
absolutely
in
philosophy
a
all
empiricists
accepted
it
enthusiastically
as
the
sum
of
philosophic
wisdom
all
apriorists
submitted
to
it
even
in
supplementing
and
modifying
it
by
and
metaphysical
additions
in
either
case
it
remained
uncontested
and
by
propounding
an
utterly
erroneous
analysis
of
the
mind
and
its
experience
entangled
philosophy
in
inextricable
difficulties
hume
had
as
philosophers
commonly
do
set
out
from
the
practically
sufficient
analysis
of
experience
which
all
find
in
language
he
accepted
therefore
from
common
sense
the
belief
that
physical
reality
is
composed
of
a
multitude
of
separate
existences
that
act
on
one
another
and
tried
to
conceive
mental
life
strictly
on
the
same
analogy
his
theory
of
experience
therefore
closely
parallels
the
atomistic
theory
of
matter
just
as
the
physicist
explains
bodies
as
collections
of
discrete
particles
so
hume
reduced
all
the
contents
of
the
mind
to
a
number
of
elementary
sensations
whether
the
mind
was
reflecting
on
its
own
internal
ideas
or
whether
it
was
undergoing
impressions
which
it
supposed
to
come
from
an
external
source
all
that
was
really
happening
was
a
succession
of
detached
sensations
it
seemed
to
hume
indisputable
that
every
distinct
perception
or
was
a
distinct
existence
and
that
all
were
equally
distinct
though
fainter
copies
of
impressions
beyond
impressions
and
ideas
it
was
unnecessary
to
look
thus
to
look
at
a
chessboard
was
to
have
a
number
of
sensations
of
black
and
white
arranged
in
a
certain
order
to
listen
to
a
piece
of
music
was
to
experience
a
succession
of
loud
and
soft
auditory
sensations
to
handle
a
stone
was
to
receive
a
group
of
sensations
of
touch
to
suppose
that
anything
beyond
these
sensory
units
was
ever
really
experienced
was
futile
fiction
experience
was
a
mosaic
of
which
the
stones
were
the
detached
sensations
and
their
copies
the
ideas
if
this
analysis
of
the
mind
were
correct
and
its
correctness
was
not
disputed
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
for
were
not
the
sensations
admitted
to
be
the
ultimate
analysis
of
all
that
was
perceived
the
belief
that
knowledge
revealed
a
world
outside
the
thinker
was
of
course
erroneous
for
common
sense
could
hardly
treat
as
merely
artificially
grouped
together
in
space
each
being
a
complex
of
a
number
of
sensations
having
relation
to
similar
complexes
it
held
rather
that
the
successive
appearances
of
things
were
related
in
time
in
such
a
way
that
they
could
be
supposed
to
reveal
a
single
object
able
to
endure
in
spite
of
surface
changes
and
to
manifest
the
identity
of
its
sensory
similarly
the
succession
of
ideas
within
the
mind
was
for
it
supported
by
the
inward
unity
of
the
soul
within
which
they
arose
moreover
hume
analysis
made
havoc
of
all
idea
of
if
every
sensation
was
a
separate
being
how
was
it
to
be
connected
with
any
other
in
any
regular
or
necessary
connection
two
events
related
as
and
must
be
a
myth
these
subversive
consequences
of
his
theory
hume
did
not
conceal
though
he
did
not
push
his
mental
to
its
logical
extreme
when
he
defined
material
objects
as
points
disposed
in
a
certain
order
he
was
in
fact
admitting
space
as
a
relating
factor
when
he
spoke
of
the
succession
of
impressions
and
ideas
in
experience
he
was
tacitly
assuming
that
what
was
apprehended
was
not
a
bare
succession
of
sensations
but
the
fact
that
they
were
succeeding
one
another
and
so
allowing
a
sense
of
temporal
relation
but
further
than
this
he
refused
to
go
the
idea
of
a
continuous
self
was
fantastic
there
was
nothing
beneath
the
ideas
to
connect
them
the
notion
of
causal
connection
was
equally
chimerical
each
sensation
was
distinct
and
existed
in
its
own
right
it
could
therefore
occur
alone
there
was
nothing
to
link
together
the
distinct
impressions
hence
necessary
connection
in
events
could
not
be
more
than
a
fiction
of
the
mind
based
on
expectation
of
customary
sequences
how
the
mind
he
had
described
as
could
form
an
expectation
or
observe
a
sequence
was
calmly
left
a
mystery
hume
then
seemed
to
leave
to
his
successors
in
philosophy
a
task
of
synthesis
he
had
tumbled
the
soul
off
her
high
but
how
to
combine
her
shattered
fragments
again
into
a
working
unity
he
declined
to
say
he
saw
the
sceptical
implications
of
his
analysis
but
professed
himself
unable
to
suggest
a
remedy
he
had
however
made
the
embarrassments
of
the
theory
of
knowledge
sufficiently
clear
for
kant
his
most
important
successor
to
hit
upon
the
most
obvious
palliative
and
in
the
of
pure
kant
set
himself
to
patch
up
hume
analysis
experience
as
it
came
through
the
channels
of
sense
he
admitted
hume
had
analysed
correctly
it
was
manifold
a
whirl
of
separate
sensations
but
these
could
not
yield
knowledge
they
must
be
made
to
cohere
and
the
way
to
do
this
he
had
found
the
mind
on
to
which
they
fell
was
equipped
with
a
complicated
apparatus
of
faculties
which
could
organize
the
chaotic
manifold
of
sense
and
turn
it
into
the
connected
world
which
common
sense
and
science
recognize
first
it
views
the
data
of
sense
in
the
light
of
its
own
intuitions
and
lo
they
are
seen
to
be
in
space
and
time
then
it
solidifies
them
with
its
own
which
turn
them
into
and
and
endow
them
with
all
the
attributes
required
to
sustain
that
status
finally
it
refers
them
all
to
a
transcendental
ego
which
is
not
indeed
a
soul
but
sufficiently
like
one
to
provide
something
that
can
admire
the
creative
synthesis
of
as
such
had
hume
lived
to
read
kant
he
would
probably
have
jeered
at
the
vain
complications
of
kant
transcendental
machinery
and
made
it
clear
that
between
the
primary
manifold
of
sensation
and
the
first
constructions
of
the
intellect
there
still
yawns
a
gulf
which
laboured
explanations
nowhere
bridge
why
does
the
chaotic
of
sensations
submit
itself
so
tamely
to
the
forming
of
the
mind
how
can
the
necessities
of
thought
which
are
the
of
the
complexities
kant
loved
operate
upon
so
alien
a
stuff
as
the
sensations
are
assumed
to
be
and
after
all
was
not
kant
a
bit
premature
in
proclaiming
the
of
his
analysis
and
of
his
refutation
of
empiricism
for
all
time
the
searching
question
why
should
the
future
resemble
the
past
had
received
no
answer
and
so
might
not
the
mind
itself
with
all
its
categories
be
susceptible
to
change
was
it
certain
that
the
miracle
whereby
the
data
presented
to
our
faculties
conformed
to
them
would
be
a
standing
one
had
not
kant
himself
as
good
as
admitted
that
our
faculties
might
distort
reality
instead
of
making
it
intelligible
the
truth
is
that
at
this
point
kant
is
open
to
a
charge
against
which
the
assumptions
he
shared
with
hume
admit
of
no
defence
hume
had
been
the
first
to
discover
that
we
are
in
the
habit
of
trying
to
rationalize
our
by
putting
ideal
constructions
upon
them
though
he
had
abstained
from
sanctifying
the
practice
by
a
hideous
jargon
of
technical
terminology
but
this
way
of
eking
out
the
facts
only
seemed
to
him
to
them
truth
in
his
view
was
to
be
reached
by
accepting
with
docility
the
sensations
given
from
without
to
set
to
work
to
connections
between
them
and
to
claim
for
them
a
higher
truth
had
seemed
to
him
an
outrage
what
right
then
had
kant
to
legitimate
the
mind
impudence
in
tampering
with
sensations
was
not
every
form
an
and
a
vain
one
at
that
to
these
objections
the
kantian
school
have
never
found
an
answer
they
have
simply
repeated
kant
phrases
about
the
necessary
which
were
to
be
added
to
hume
data
the
english
psychologists
the
mills
bain
etc
exhibited
a
similar
fidelity
they
never
accepted
the
but
relied
on
association
of
to
build
up
a
mind
out
of
isolated
sensations
but
was
this
expedient
really
thinkable
for
if
all
or
qualities
are
separate
entities
how
can
the
addition
of
more
existences
of
the
same
sort
really
bind
them
together
if
in
cat
is
upon
the
wall
is
a
distinct
entity
which
has
to
relate
and
what
is
to
connect
with
and
with
the
atomizing
method
carried
to
its
logical
extreme
demands
that
not
only
but
also
should
be
essentially
disconnected
and
then
of
course
thinking
can
cohere
psychology
then
had
worked
itself
to
a
breakdown
by
accepting
the
analysis
offered
by
hume
and
dragged
philosophy
with
it
yet
the
escape
was
as
easy
as
the
egg
of
columbus
to
the
insight
of
genius
william
james
had
merely
to
invert
the
problem
instead
of
assuming
with
hume
that
because
some
experiences
seemed
to
attest
the
presence
of
distinct
objects
all
connections
were
illusory
and
all
experience
must
ultimately
consist
of
psychical
atoms
james
had
merely
to
maintain
that
this
separation
was
secondary
and
artificial
and
that
experience
was
initially
a
continuum
once
this
is
pointed
out
the
fact
is
obvious
the
stream
of
experience
no
doubt
contains
what
it
is
afterwards
possible
to
single
out
as
but
it
presents
them
also
as
connected
by
moreover
the
or
and
their
exhibit
the
immediate
indiscerptible
unity
of
a
fluid
rather
than
a
succession
of
flashes
temporal
and
spatial
relations
with
all
the
connections
they
sustain
are
perceived
just
as
directly
as
what
we
come
to
distinguish
as
the
in
them
james
insists
not
appear
to
itself
chopped
up
in
bits
and
ought
to
say
a
feeling
of
a
feeling
of
a
feeling
of
and
a
feeling
of
quite
as
readily
as
we
say
a
feeling
of
or
a
feeling
of
all
things
in
experience
naturally
to
use
a
phrase
of
bergson
they
are
distinct
and
they
are
united
at
the
same
time
the
great
crux
in
hume
is
thus
seen
to
be
illusory
immediate
experience
does
not
require
it
calls
for
it
is
not
a
jigsaw
puzzle
to
be
pieced
together
without
glue
it
is
a
confused
whole
which
has
to
be
divided
and
set
in
order
for
clear
thinking
hume
mistake
was
to
have
started
from
experience
partly
by
common
sense
and
not
from
the
flux
his
were
the
qualities
already
analysed
out
of
the
flux
he
took
these
selections
for
the
whole
and
neglected
the
other
less
obvious
features
in
it
the
relations
which
floated
them
thus
the
puzzle
do
relations
relate
received
its
solution
in
this
new
account
of
experience
philosophers
are
puzzled
by
this
question
because
they
confuse
percepts
with
concepts
percepts
are
in
relation
but
concepts
being
ideal
dissections
of
the
perceptual
flux
are
discontinuous
terms
which
have
to
be
related
by
an
act
of
thought
because
they
were
made
for
this
very
purpose
of
distinction
thus
the
eye
sees
cats
sitting
upon
walls
as
parts
of
a
rural
landscape
and
without
the
sharp
distinctions
which
exist
between
the
concepts
these
ideas
were
to
disconnect
cat
in
thought
from
the
site
it
sat
upon
thought
then
has
the
it
professed
to
find
it
has
only
to
unmake
it
and
to
allow
the
distinctions
it
held
apart
to
merge
again
into
the
stream
of
change
all
hume
problems
therefore
are
unreal
and
those
of
his
apriorist
critics
are
doubly
removed
from
reality
the
whole
conception
of
philosophy
as
aiming
at
uniting
disjointed
data
in
a
higher
synthesis
runs
counter
to
the
real
movement
which
aims
at
the
analysis
of
a
given
whole
the
real
question
about
causation
is
not
how
events
can
be
connected
causally
but
why
are
certain
antecedents
preferred
and
dissected
out
and
entitled
so
the
is
not
one
undiscoverable
item
imagined
to
keep
in
order
a
host
of
other
such
items
any
given
moment
of
a
consciousness
is
just
the
mass
of
its
but
these
are
consciously
the
heirs
of
its
history
and
connected
with
a
past
which
is
remembered
no
transcendental
ego
could
do
more
to
support
the
process
of
experience
than
is
achieved
by
stream
of
consciousness
which
carries
its
own
past
along
here
then
is
the
straight
way
james
desiderated
a
critical
philosophy
which
goes
not
the
complexities
of
kantism
but
leaves
them
on
one
side
as
superfluous
but
there
remains
an
even
more
important
deduction
from
the
new
psychology
hume
had
been
convicted
of
error
in
selecting
those
elements
of
the
flux
which
served
his
purpose
and
neglecting
the
rest
but
this
mistake
might
reveal
the
important
fact
that
all
analysis
was
a
choice
and
inspired
by
volitions
a
mind
that
analyses
can
not
but
be
in
handling
its
experience
it
manipulates
it
to
serve
its
ends
it
emphasizes
only
those
portions
of
the
flux
which
seem
to
it
important
in
a
better
and
fairer
analysis
than
hume
these
features
will
persist
it
too
would
be
a
product
of
selection
of
a
selection
depending
on
its
maker
preferences
as
james
showed
the
distinction
between
and
between
and
results
only
from
the
differential
values
we
attach
to
the
parts
of
the
flux
according
as
they
seem
important
or
interesting
to
us
or
not
the
volitional
contribution
is
in
our
thinking
and
once
this
volitional
interference
with
perception
is
shown
to
be
indispensable
it
must
be
allowed
to
be
legitimate
nor
can
this
approval
of
our
interference
be
restricted
to
selections
it
must
be
extended
to
just
as
we
can
select
factors
from
to
construct
we
can
add
hypotheses
to
it
to
make
it
we
can
claim
the
right
of
causal
analysis
and
assume
that
our
dissections
have
laid
bare
the
inner
springs
of
the
connection
of
events
moreover
to
the
world
which
our
choice
has
built
out
of
the
chaos
of
we
may
hypothetically
add
and
regions
b
both
are
transformations
of
given
by
the
will
but
like
the
postulate
of
causal
series
experience
confirm
them
kant
activity
of
the
mind
may
thus
in
a
sense
supply
an
answer
to
hume
but
only
in
a
voluntaristic
philosophy
which
would
probably
have
seemed
too
bold
both
to
him
and
to
hume
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
we
do
not
approach
the
data
of
perception
in
an
attitude
of
quiescent
resignation
our
desires
and
needs
equip
us
with
assumptions
and
principles
which
originate
from
within
not
from
without
but
how
precisely
should
this
mental
contribution
to
knowledge
be
conceived
in
the
last
chapter
of
his
james
suggested
that
the
mind
organization
is
essentially
biological
it
has
evolved
according
to
sound
darwinian
principles
and
in
so
doing
the
fittest
of
its
have
survived
but
were
these
variations
quite
fortuitous
may
they
not
have
been
purposive
responses
to
the
stimulation
of
environment
can
logic
have
been
invented
like
saws
and
ships
for
purposes
of
human
service
these
are
some
of
the
stimulating
questions
which
james
work
in
has
suggested
footnotes

b
this
is
the
substance
of
the
doctrine
of
will
to
believe
chapter
iii
will
in
cognition
the
new
psychology
of
james
was
bound
to
produce
a
new
theory
of
knowledge
and
though
it
did
not
actually
explore
this
problem
it
contained
several
valuable
suggestions
upon
the
subject
for
instance
in
a
brief
passage
discussing
relations
of
belief
and
will
james
pointed
out
that
belief
is
essentially
an
attitude
of
the
will
towards
an
idea
adding
that
in
order
to
acquire
a
belief
need
only
in
cold
blood
act
as
if
the
thing
in
question
were
real
and
keep
acting
as
if
it
were
real
and
it
will
infallibly
end
by
growing
into
such
a
connection
with
our
life
that
it
will
become
real
this
passage
is
an
outline
of
the
doctrine
of
will
to
believe
which
he
was
afterwards
to
develop
so
forcibly
again
in
his
last
chapter
james
criticized
the
doctrine
of
spencer
that
all
the
principles
of
thought
all
its
general
truths
and
axioms
were
derived
from
impressions
of
the
external
world
he
argued
on
the
other
hand
that
such
ways
of
looking
at
phenomena
must
originate
in
the
mind
and
be
prior
to
the
experience
which
confirms
them
without
digging
further
into
the
character
of
this
mental
contribution
to
knowledge
james
contented
himself
with
the
suggestion
that
the
use
of
these
axiomatic
principles
might
be
construed
in
darwinian
style
as
a
surviving
by
its
fitness
thus
introducing
into
his
account
of
mental
process
the
important
idea
that
thinking
might
be
tested
by
its
vital
value
what
if
knowledge
be
neither
a
dull
submission
to
dictation
from
without
nor
an
unexplained
necessity
of
thought
what
if
it
be
a
bold
adventure
an
experimental
sally
of
a
will
to
live
to
know
and
to
control
reality
what
if
its
principles
were
frankly
and
their
truth
had
to
be
before
it
was
tested
and
assured
in
a
word
what
if
first
principles
were
to
begin
with
thus
the
way
is
paved
from
the
new
psychology
to
a
new
theory
of
knowledge
a
third
alternative
to
the
banal
dilemma
of
or
suggests
itself
the
old
view
as
typified
by
mill
was
that
the
mind
had
been
impressed
with
all
its
principles
such
as
the
truths
of
arithmetic
the
axioms
of
geometry
and
the
law
of
causation
by
an
uncontradicted
course
of
experience
until
it
generalized
facts
into
and
was
enabled
to
predict
a
similar
future
with
certainty
but
this
theory
had
really
been
exploded
in
advance
by
hume
facts
do
not
as
causally
connected
nor
if
they
did
would
this
guarantee
that
they
will
continue
to
do
so
in
the
future
the
continuum
of
experience
we
may
add
is
not
as
a
series
of
arithmetical
units
or
geometrical
equalities
unless
we
deliberately
measure
it
out
in
accordance
with
mathematical
principles
empiricism
thus
gives
no
real
account
of
the
scientific
rational
order
of
the
world
but
does
it
follow
from
the
failure
of
empiricism
that
apriorism
is
true
this
has
always
been
assumed
and
held
to
dispense
rationalist
philosophers
from
giving
any
direct
and
positive
proof
that
these
principles
are
truths
but
manifestly
their
procedure
is
logically
far
from
cogent
if
a
third
explanation
can
be
thought
of
it
will
follow
that
apriorism
is
true
all
that
follows
is
that
has
to
be
assumed
before
experience
proves
it
what
that
something
is
and
whence
it
comes
remains
an
open
question
moreover
apriorism
has
escaped
from
the
empirical
doubt
about
the
future
even
granted
that
facts
now
conform
to
the
necessities
of
our
thoughts
why
should
they
so
comport
themselves
for
ever
let
us
therefore
try
a
compromise
which
ignores
neither
that
which
we
bring
to
experience
like
empiricism
nor
that
which
we
gain
from
experience
like
apriorism
this
compromise
is
effected
by
the
doctrine
of
postulation
for
though
a
postulate
proceeds
from
us
and
is
meant
to
guide
thought
in
anticipating
facts
it
yet
allows
the
facts
to
test
and
mould
it
so
that
its
working
modifies
expands
or
restricts
its
demands
and
fits
it
to
meet
the
exigencies
of
experience
and
permits
also
a
certain
reinterpretation
of
the
previous
in
order
to
conform
them
to
the
postulate
a
postulate
thus
fully
meets
the
demands
of
apriorism
it
is
in
claim
because
it
is
convenient
and
economical
to
make
a
rule
carry
as
far
as
it
will
go
and
it
is
because
all
fresh
facts
are
on
principle
subjected
to
it
in
the
hope
that
they
will
support
and
illustrate
it
yet
a
postulate
can
never
be
accused
of
being
a
mere
sophistication
or
a
bar
to
the
progress
of
knowledge
because
it
is
always
willing
to
submit
to
verification
in
the
course
of
fresh
experience
and
can
always
be
reconstructed
or
abandoned
should
it
cease
to
edify
a
long
and
successful
course
of
service
raises
a
postulate
to
the
dignity
of
an
a
principle
which
it
is
incredible
anyone
should
think
worth
disputing
whereas
repeated
failure
in
application
degrades
it
to
the
position
of
a
prejudice
an
opinion
which
is
always
belied
by
its
consequences
a
thus
differs
essentially
from
the
truth
by
its
dependence
upon
the
will
by
its
being
the
product
of
a
free
choice
we
have
always
to
select
the
assumptions
upon
which
we
mean
to
act
in
our
commerce
with
reality
we
select
the
rules
upon
which
we
go
and
we
select
the
by
which
we
claim
to
support
our
rules
stripping
them
of
all
the
details
involved
by
their
position
in
the
flux
of
happenings
thus
we
emphasize
that
side
of
things
which
fits
in
with
our
expectations
until
the
facts
are
sufficiently
to
figure
as
of
our
postulation
and
the
verifying
of
postulates
is
thus
a
process
of
reciprocal
discrimination
and
selection
the
postulate
once
formulated
we
seek
in
the
flux
for
confirmations
of
it
and
thus
construct
a
system
of
which
are
relative
to
it
that
is
how
the
postulate
reacts
upon
experience
if
on
the
other
hand
this
process
of
selection
is
unfruitful
and
the
confirmations
of
our
rule
turn
out
infinitesimal
we
alter
the
rule
and
thus
the
in
the
case
reject
the
postulate
this
continuous
process
of
selection
and
rejection
of
and
has
as
we
have
said
a
thoroughly
tinge
the
fitness
of
a
postulate
to
survive
is
being
continually
tested
it
springs
in
the
first
place
from
a
human
hope
that
events
may
be
systematized
in
a
certain
way
and
it
endures
so
long
as
it
enables
men
to
deal
with
them
in
that
way
if
it
fails
the
formation
of
fresh
ideals
and
fresh
hypotheses
is
demanded
but
that
which
causes
one
postulate
to
prevail
over
another
is
always
the
satisfaction
which
if
successful
it
promises
to
some
need
or
desire
thus
is
everywhere
inspired
by
it
is
an
the
most
potent
man
has
found
whereby
he
brings
about
a
harmony
with
his
environment
this
harmony
is
always
something
of
a
compromise
we
postulate
conformity
between
nature
and
one
of
our
ideals
we
usually
desire
more
than
we
can
get
but
insist
on
all
that
nature
can
concede
causation
serves
as
a
good
example
experience
as
it
first
comes
to
us
is
a
mere
flood
of
happenings
with
no
distinction
between
causal
and
casual
sequences
clearly
our
whole
ability
to
control
our
life
or
even
to
continue
it
demands
that
we
should
what
happens
and
guide
our
actions
accordingly
we
therefore
postulate
a
right
to
the
flux
to
fit
together
selected
series
without
reference
to
the
rest
thus
a
systematic
network
of
natural
is
slowly
knit
together
and
chaos
visibly
transforms
itself
into
scientific
order
the
postulation
of
is
verified
by
its
success
moreover
it
is
to
be
noted
that
to
this
postulate
there
is
no
alternative
a
belief
that
all
events
are
casual
would
be
scientifically
worthless
so
is
a
doctrine
still
popular
among
philosophers
that
the
only
true
is
the
total
universe
at
one
moment
the
only
true
the
whole
of
reality
at
the
next
for
that
is
merely
to
reinstate
the
given
chaos
science
tried
to
analyse
and
to
forbid
us
to
make
selections
from
it
it
would
make
prediction
wholly
vain
and
entangle
truth
in
a
totality
of
things
which
is
unique
at
every
instant
and
never
can
recur
the
principles
of
mathematics
are
as
clearly
postulates
in
euclidean
geometry
we
assume
definitions
of
which
are
never
found
in
nature
but
form
the
most
convenient
abstractions
for
measuring
things
both
and
as
defined
for
mathematical
purposes
are
ideal
constructions
drawn
from
empirical
extension
and
succession
feelings
and
purged
of
the
subjective
variations
of
these
experiences
nevertheless
geometry
forms
the
handiest
system
for
applying
to
experience
and
calculating
shapes
and
motions
but
ideally
other
systems
might
be
used
the
have
constructed
other
ideal
out
of
postulates
differing
from
euclid
though
when
applied
to
real
space
their
greater
complexity
destroys
their
value
the
postulatory
character
of
the
arithmetical
unit
is
quite
as
clear
for
in
application
we
always
have
to
as
to
what
is
to
count
as
if
we
agree
to
count
apples
and
count
the
two
halves
of
an
apple
as
each
equalling
one
we
are
said
to
be
though
if
we
were
dividing
the
apple
among
two
applicants
it
would
be
quite
right
to
treat
each
half
as
share
again
though
one
penny
added
to
another
makes
two
one
drop
of
water
added
to
another
makes
one
or
a
dozen
according
as
it
is
dropped
common
sense
therefore
admits
that
we
may
reckon
variously
and
that
arithmetic
does
not
to
things
again
it
is
impossible
to
concede
any
meaning
even
to
the
central
of
thought
itself
the
law
of
identity
is
a
except
as
a
postulate
outside
of
formal
logic
and
lunatic
asylums
no
one
wishes
to
assert
that
is
a
all
significant
assertion
takes
the
form
is
b
but
a
and
b
are
and
indeed
no
two
are
ever
the
same
hence
when
we
assert
either
the
of
in
two
contexts
or
that
of
and
in
is
b
we
are
clearly
differences
which
really
exist
we
postulate
that
in
spite
of
these
differences
a
and
b
will
for
our
purposes
behave
as
if
they
were
one
and
we
should
realize
that
this
postulate
is
of
our
making
and
involves
a
risk
it
may
be
that
experience
refuses
to
confirm
it
and
convicts
us
instead
of
a
identity
in
short
identity
we
reason
from
is
made
by
our
postulating
an
irrelevance
of
there
is
thus
perhaps
no
fundamental
procedure
of
thought
in
which
we
can
not
trace
some
deliberately
adopted
attitude
we
distinguish
between
and
the
world
perhaps
because
we
have
more
control
over
our
thoughts
and
limbs
and
less
or
none
over
sticks
and
stones
and
mountains
fundamental
as
it
is
it
is
a
distinction
experience
and
is
not
given
but
elaborated
in
the
course
of
our
dealings
with
it
similarly
in
accordance
with
its
varying
degrees
of
vividness
continuity
and
value
experience
itself
gets
sorted
into
and
in
short
when
the
processes
of
discriminating
between
and
are
considered
all
these
distinctions
will
ultimately
be
found
to
be
judgments
of
value
nor
is
it
only
in
the
realm
of
scientific
knowing
that
postulation
reveals
itself
as
a
practicable
and
successful
method
of
anticipating
experience
and
consolidating
fact
the
same
method
has
always
been
employed
by
man
in
reaching
out
towards
the
final
syntheses
which
in
imagination
complete
his
vision
of
reality
the
of
all
religions
originate
in
postulates
and
and
are
essentially
demands
for
a
moral
order
in
experience
which
transcend
the
given
the
value
of
the
actual
world
is
supplemented
and
enhanced
by
being
conceived
as
projected
and
continued
into
a
greater
and
our
postulates
are
verified
by
the
salutary
influence
they
exercise
on
our
earthly
life
both
postulation
and
verification
then
are
applicable
to
the
problems
of
religion
as
of
science
this
is
the
meaning
of
the
will
to
believe
when
james
first
defined
and
defended
it
it
provoked
abundant
protest
on
the
ground
that
it
allowed
everyone
to
believe
whatever
he
pleased
and
to
call
it
the
critics
had
simply
failed
to
see
that
verification
by
experience
is
just
as
integral
a
part
of
voluntaristic
procedure
as
experimental
postulation
and
that
james
himself
had
from
the
first
asserted
this
indeed
that
he
had
first
given
a
theological
illustration
of
the
function
of
volition
in
knowing
was
merely
an
accident
but
that
the
will
to
believe
was
capable
of
being
generalized
into
a
voluntarist
theory
of
all
knowledge
was
soon
shown
in
schiller
as
chapter
iv
the
dilemmas
of
dogmatism
every
man
probably
is
by
instinct
a
dogmatist
he
feels
perfectly
sure
that
he
knows
some
things
and
is
right
about
them
against
the
world
whatever
he
believes
in
he
does
not
doubt
but
holds
to
be
or
indisputably
true
his
naive
dogmatism
moreover
spontaneously
assumes
that
his
truth
is
universal
and
shared
by
all
others
if
now
he
could
live
like
a
fakir
wholly
wrapped
in
a
cloud
of
his
own
imaginings
and
nothing
ever
happened
to
disappoint
his
expectations
to
jar
upon
his
prejudices
and
to
convict
him
of
error
if
he
never
held
converse
with
anyone
who
took
a
different
view
and
controverted
him
his
dogmatism
would
be
lifelong
and
incurable
but
as
he
lives
socially
he
has
in
practice
to
outgrow
it
and
this
lands
him
in
a
serious
theoretical
dilemma
he
has
to
learn
to
live
with
others
who
differ
from
him
in
their
dogmatizing
social
life
plainly
would
become
impossible
if
all
rigidly
insisted
on
the
absolute
rightness
of
their
own
beliefs
and
the
absolute
wrongness
of
all
others
so
compromises
have
to
be
made
to
get
at
a
common
it
must
be
recognized
that
not
everything
which
is
believed
to
be
is
knowledge
in
fact
it
is
safer
to
assume
that
none
have
knowledge
though
all
think
they
have
to
say
fact
men
only
have
which
may
be
nearer
to
or
farther
from
truth
but
are
not
of
necessity
as
unquestionable
as
they
seem
to
be
out
of
this
concession
to
the
social
life
arise
three
problems
how
are
to
be
compared
with
each
other
and
how
is
the
extent
of
their
or
to
be
determined
how
is
the
belief
in
absolute
truth
to
be
interpreted
and
discounted
how
is
the
penitent
dogmatist
once
he
has
allowed
doubt
to
corrupt
his
to
be
stopped
from
doubting
all
things
and
turning
sceptic
as
regards
the
first
problem
the
first
question
is
whether
we
shall
try
to
opinions
and
to
arrive
at
a
standard
of
value
by
which
to
measure
them
by
comparing
the
opinions
themselves
with
one
another
or
shall
presume
that
there
must
be
some
absolute
standard
which
alone
is
truly
true
whether
we
are
aware
of
it
or
not
the
former
view
is
the
latter
is
in
the
matter
of
truth
now
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
absolutism
is
more
congenial
to
our
natural
prejudices
accordingly
it
is
the
method
tried
first
but
it
soon
conducts
dogmatism
to
an
awkward
series
of
dilemmas
if
there
is
absolute
truth
who
has
it
and
who
can
use
the
absolute
criterion
of
opinions
it
is
supposed
to
form
not
surely
everyone
who
he
has
it
will
never
do
to
let
every
dogmatist
vote
for
himself
and
condemn
all
others
that
way
war
and
madness
lie
until
there
is
absolute
agreement
there
can
not
be
absolute
truth
but
absolute
truth
may
still
be
reverenced
as
an
ideal
to
save
us
from
the
scepticism
to
which
a
complete
relativity
of
truth
would
lead
but
would
it
save
us
if
it
is
admitted
that
no
one
can
arrogate
to
himself
its
possession
what
use
is
it
to
believe
that
it
is
an
ideal
for
if
no
one
can
assume
that
he
has
it
all
truth
is
in
fact
such
as
the
relativist
asserted
and
scepticism
is
just
as
inevitable
as
before
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
sceptical
inference
whether
there
is
no
absolute
truth
or
whether
it
is
unattained
by
man
and
human
unattainable
it
was
a
mistake
therefore
to
admit
that
opinions
can
not
be
compared
together
some
are
much
more
certain
than
others
and
indeed
and
let
us
therefore
take
these
to
be
if
so
the
thinker
who
feels
most
certain
he
is
right
is
most
likely
to
be
right
this
suggestion
will
be
welcomed
by
all
dogmatists
until
they
discover
that
it
does
not
help
them
to
agree
together
because
they
are
all
as
certain
as
can
be
but
a
man
will
urge
against
it
that
is
a
subjective
and
psychological
and
that
no
one
has
been
able
to
devise
a
method
for
distinguishing
the
alleged
logical
from
the
undeniable
psychological
certainty
he
will
hesitate
to
say
therefore
that
because
a
belief
seems
certain
it
is
true
and
to
trust
the
formal
claim
to
infallibility
which
is
made
in
every
judgment
and
when
are
appealed
to
he
will
ask
how
intuitions
are
to
be
discriminated
from
sound
from
insane
and
inquire
to
what
he
is
committing
himself
in
admitting
the
truth
of
intuitions
he
will
demand
therefore
the
publication
of
a
list
of
the
intuitions
which
are
absolutely
true
but
he
will
not
get
it
and
if
he
did
it
may
be
predicted
that
he
would
not
find
a
single
one
which
has
not
been
disputed
by
some
eminent
philosopher
intuitions
therefore
are
an
embarrassment
rather
than
a
help
to
intellectualism
it
has
to
maintain
both
that
intuitions
are
the
foundations
of
all
truth
and
certitude
and
also
that
not
all
are
true
but
our
natural
curiosity
as
to
how
these
sorts
are
to
be
known
apart
is
left
unsatisfied
we
must
not
ask
which
are
true
and
which
not
no
one
can
say
in
advance
about
what
matters
intuitive
certainty
is
possible
what
is
or
is
not
an
intuition
is
revealed
only
to
reflection
after
the
event
only
if
an
intuition
played
us
false
we
may
be
sure
it
not
infallible
it
must
either
have
been
one
of
the
fallible
sort
or
else
no
intuition
at
all
at
this
point
universal
scepticism
begins
to
raise
its
hydra
head
and
to
grin
at
the
dogmatist
discomfiture
for
in
point
of
fact
the
history
of
thought
reveals
not
a
steady
accumulation
of
indubitable
truth
but
a
continuous
strife
of
opinions
in
which
the
most
widely
accepted
beliefs
daily
succumb
to
fresh
criticism
and
fall
into
disrepute
as
the
of
the
past
nothing
it
seems
can
guarantee
a
however
firmly
it
may
be
believed
for
a
time
from
the
corrosive
force
of
new
speculation
and
changed
opinion
to
survey
the
field
of
philosophic
dispute
strewn
with
the
remains
of
systems
and
certainties
is
to
be
led
irresistibly
to
a
sceptical
doubt
as
to
the
competence
of
human
thought
if
truth
is
our
ideal
and
acquaintance
with
reality
our
aim
then
in
view
of
the
persistent
illusions
on
both
these
points
to
which
the
human
mind
is
liable
it
seems
necessary
to
recognize
the
hopelessness
of
our
search
thus
the
last
dilemma
of
dogmatism
is
reached
in
view
of
the
diversity
of
human
beliefs
and
the
discredit
which
has
historically
fallen
on
the
most
axiomatic
articles
of
faith
we
must
either
admit
scepticism
to
be
the
issue
of
the
debate
or
else
condemning
our
absolute
view
of
truth
find
some
means
of
utilizing
the
relative
truths
which
are
all
that
humanity
seems
able
to
grasp
but
to
come
to
terms
with
relativism
is
to
renounce
the
dogmatic
attitude
entirely
and
to
approach
the
problems
of
philosophy
in
a
totally
different
spirit
chapter
v
the
problem
of
truth
and
error
it
has
been
shown
in
the
last
chapter
how
urgent
has
become
the
problem
of
discriminating
between
the
true
and
false
among
relative
for
absolute
truth
has
become
a
chimera
an
illusion
and
intuition
untrustworthy
all
three
are
psychologically
very
real
to
those
who
believe
in
them
but
logically
they
succumb
to
the
assaults
of
a
scepticism
which
infers
from
the
fact
that
no
are
absolute
that
all
may
reasonably
be
overthrown
the
only
obstacle
to
its
triumph
lies
in
the
existence
of
truths
which
are
absolute
and
do
not
claim
to
be
and
in
the
unexamined
possibility
that
in
a
relativist
interpretation
of
all
truth
a
meaning
may
be
found
for
the
distinction
between
and
now
not
even
a
sceptic
could
deny
that
the
size
of
an
object
is
better
measured
by
a
than
by
the
eye
even
though
it
may
be
meaningless
to
ask
what
its
size
may
be
absolutely
or
that
it
is
probable
that
bread
will
be
found
more
nourishing
than
stone
even
though
it
may
not
be
a
perfect
elixir
of
life
even
if
he
denied
this
the
sceptic
would
convict
his
of
insincerity
and
at
any
rate
no
one
has
been
or
can
be
a
sceptic
whatever
the
extent
of
his
doubts
this
fact
is
construed
by
the
pragmatist
as
a
significant
indication
of
the
way
out
of
the
epistemological
the
truths
which
intellectualism
passed
by
with
contempt
may
differ
in
and
lead
to
the
conceptions
of
and
certainty
which
may
be
better
adapted
to
the
requirements
of
human
life
than
the
elusive
and
discredited
ideals
of
absolute
truth
and
certainty
and
may
enable
us
to
justify
the
distinctions
we
make
between
the
and
the
at
any
rate
this
suggestion
seems
worth
following
up
to
begin
with
we
must
radically
disabuse
our
minds
of
the
idea
that
thinking
from
even
the
and
that
impress
the
uncritical
so
much
with
their
claim
to
infallibility
are
really
the
results
of
antecedent
doubts
and
ponderings
and
would
never
be
enunciated
unless
there
were
thought
to
be
a
dispute
about
them
in
real
life
thought
starts
from
perplexities
from
situations
in
which
as
professor
dewey
says
beliefs
have
to
be
and
it
aims
at
setting
doubts
at
rest
it
is
psychologically
impossible
for
a
rational
mind
to
assert
what
it
knows
to
be
true
and
supposes
everyone
else
to
admit
the
truth
of
this
is
why
even
a
philosopher
conversation
does
not
consist
of
a
rehearsal
of
all
the
unchallenged
truisms
that
he
can
remember
being
thus
conditioned
by
a
doubt
every
judgment
is
a
challenge
it
claims
truth
and
backs
its
claims
by
the
authority
of
its
maker
but
it
would
be
folly
to
imagine
that
it
thereby
becomes
true
or
is
meant
to
be
universally
accepted
without
testing
its
maker
must
know
this
as
well
as
anyone
unless
his
dogmatism
has
quite
blotted
out
his
common
sense
indeed
he
may
himself
have
given
preference
to
the
judgment
he
made
over
the
alternatives
that
occurred
to
him
only
after
much
debate
and
hesitation
and
may
propound
it
only
as
a
basis
for
further
discussion
and
testing
initially
then
every
judgment
is
a
and
this
claim
is
merely
it
does
not
that
the
claim
is
absolutely
true
and
that
it
is
impious
to
question
it
on
the
contrary
it
has
still
to
be
validated
by
others
and
may
work
in
such
a
way
that
its
own
maker
withdraws
it
and
corrects
it
by
a
better
the
intellectualist
accounts
of
truth
have
all
failed
to
make
this
vital
distinction
between
and
validated
truth
they
rest
on
a
of
formal
with
absolute
and
it
is
on
this
account
that
they
can
not
distinguish
between
and
error
for
false
judgments
also
formally
claim
no
judgment
alleges
that
it
is
false
c
on
the
other
hand
if
the
distinction
between
and
validated
truths
is
made
there
ceases
to
be
any
difficulty
about
the
conception
and
correction
of
errors
however
difficult
it
may
be
to
detect
them
in
practice
will
be
which
have
worked
well
and
maintained
themselves
such
as
have
been
superseded
by
better
ones
all
must
be
by
something
more
objective
than
their
own
and
this
testing
by
their
working
and
the
consequences
to
which
they
lead
may
go
on
indefinitely
in
other
words
however
much
a
has
been
validated
it
is
always
possible
to
test
it
further
it
is
never
theoretically
however
well
it
may
practically
be
assured
for
a
confirmation
of
this
doctrine
pragmatism
appeals
to
the
history
of
scientific
truth
which
has
shown
a
continuous
correction
of
which
were
as
as
better
statements
for
them
became
available
it
may
also
be
confirmed
negatively
by
the
breakdown
of
the
current
definitions
of
truth
which
all
seem
in
the
end
to
mean
nothing
the
oldest
and
commonest
definition
of
a
which
is
given
is
that
it
is
correspondence
of
a
thought
to
reality
but
intellectualism
never
perceived
the
difficulties
lurking
in
it
at
first
sight
this
seems
a
brave
attempt
to
get
outside
the
circle
of
thought
in
order
to
test
its
value
and
to
control
its
vagaries
unluckily
this
theory
can
only
assert
and
neither
explains
nor
proves
the
connection
between
the
thought
and
the
reality
it
desiderates
for
granting
that
it
is
the
intent
of
every
thought
to
correspond
with
reality
we
must
yet
inquire
how
the
alleged
correspondence
is
to
be
made
out
made
out
it
must
be
for
as
the
criterion
is
quite
formal
and
holds
of
all
assertions
the
claim
to
may
be
false
to
prove
the
correspondence
then
the
would
have
somehow
to
be
known
apart
from
the
of
the
thought
in
order
that
the
two
might
be
compared
and
found
to
agree
but
if
the
reality
were
already
known
directly
what
would
be
the
need
of
asserting
an
idea
of
it
and
claiming
for
this
how
moreover
could
the
claim
be
tested
if
as
is
admitted
the
reality
is
not
directly
known
to
assert
the
must
become
a
groundless
postulate
about
something
which
is
defined
to
transcend
all
knowledge
the
correspondence
theory
then
does
not
the
of
the
assertion
it
only
gives
a
fresh
definition
of
it
a
thought
it
says
is
one
which
to
with
a
so
does
a
false
and
hence
the
theory
leaves
us
as
we
were
puzzled
to
distinguish
them
d
yet
the
theory
is
not
wholly
wrong
many
of
our
thoughts
do
claim
to
correspond
with
reality
in
ways
that
can
be
verified
if
the
judgment
is
a
green
carpet
in
my
hall
is
taken
to
mean
i
enter
my
hall
i
shall
a
green
carpet
perception
tests
whether
the
judgment
with
the
reality
perceived
and
so
goes
to
validate
or
disprove
the
claim
but
the
limits
within
which
this
correspondence
works
are
very
strait
it
applies
only
to
such
judgments
as
are
anticipations
of
perception
e
and
will
test
a
only
where
there
is
willingness
to
act
on
it
it
implies
an
experiment
and
is
not
a
wholly
intellectual
process
the
superiority
of
the
theory
over
the
belief
in
lies
in
its
insistence
that
thought
is
not
to
audit
its
own
accounts
its
success
or
failure
depends
upon
factors
external
to
it
which
establish
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
its
claims
no
such
guarantee
is
offered
by
the
next
theory
which
is
known
as
the
or
theory
in
order
to
avoid
the
difficulty
which
wrecked
the
theory
that
of
making
the
truth
of
an
assertion
reside
in
an
inexperienceable
relation
to
an
unattainable
reality
this
view
maintains
that
an
idea
is
true
if
it
is
consistent
with
the
rest
of
our
thoughts
and
so
can
be
fitted
with
them
into
a
coherent
system
no
doubt
a
coherence
among
our
ideas
is
a
convenience
and
a
part
of
their
but
it
is
hardly
a
test
of
their
objective
truth
for
a
harmonious
system
of
thoughts
is
conceivable
which
would
either
not
apply
to
reality
at
all
or
if
applied
would
completely
fail
on
this
theory
systematic
delusions
fictions
and
dreams
might
properly
lay
claim
to
truth
true
they
might
not
be
quite
consistent
but
neither
are
the
systems
of
our
sciences
if
then
this
coherence
be
insisted
on
this
test
condemns
our
whole
knowledge
if
not
it
remains
formal
and
fails
to
recognize
any
distinctions
of
value
in
the
claims
which
can
be
systematized
to
avoid
this
ad
it
has
been
suggested
that
it
is
not
the
coherence
of
the
idea
in
human
finite
minds
which
constitutes
but
the
perfect
consistency
of
the
experience
of
an
absolute
mind
the
test
then
of
our
limited
coherency
will
lie
in
its
relation
to
this
absolute
system
but
here
we
have
the
correspondence
doctrine
once
again
in
a
fresh
disguise
our
human
systems
are
now
if
they
correspond
with
the
absolute
but
as
there
is
no
way
for
us
of
sharing
the
absolute
experience
our
test
is
again
illusory
and
productive
of
a
depressing
scepticism
and
again
we
have
only
asserted
that
truth
is
what
to
be
part
of
the
absolute
system
a
word
may
be
devoted
to
the
simple
refusal
of
intuitionists
to
give
an
account
of
truth
on
the
ground
that
it
is
truth
is
taken
to
be
an
ultimate
unanalyzable
quality
of
certain
propositions
intuitively
felt
and
incapable
of
description
error
by
the
same
token
should
be
equally
indefinable
and
as
immediately
apprehended
how
then
can
there
be
differences
of
opinion
and
mistakes
as
to
what
is
true
and
what
false
how
is
it
that
a
proposition
which
is
felt
to
be
so
often
turns
out
to
be
erroneous
if
all
errors
are
felt
to
be
true
by
those
they
deceive
is
it
not
clear
that
immediate
feeling
is
not
a
good
enough
test
of
a
validated
truth
thus
once
again
we
find
that
an
account
of
is
being
foisted
on
us
in
place
of
a
description
of
the
intellectualist
then
being
in
every
case
unable
to
justify
the
vital
distinction
commonly
made
between
the
true
and
the
false
we
return
to
the
pragmatist
he
starts
with
no
preconceptions
as
to
what
truth
must
mean
whether
it
exists
or
not
he
is
content
to
watch
how
claims
to
truth
get
themselves
validated
in
experience
he
observes
that
every
question
is
intimately
related
to
some
scheme
of
human
purposes
for
it
has
to
be
in
order
to
come
into
being
hence
every
inquiry
arises
and
every
question
is
asked
because
of
obstacles
and
problems
which
arise
in
the
carrying
out
of
human
purposes
so
soon
as
uncertainty
arises
in
the
course
of
fulfilling
a
purpose
an
idea
or
belief
is
formulated
acted
to
fill
the
gap
where
immediate
certitude
has
broken
down
this
engenders
the
which
is
necessarily
a
in
its
maker
eyes
because
it
has
been
selected
by
him
and
judged
to
any
alternative
that
occurred
to
him
how
then
is
it
tested
simply
by
the
consequences
which
follow
from
adopting
it
and
using
it
as
an
assumption
upon
which
to
work
if
these
consequences
are
satisfactory
if
they
promote
the
purpose
in
hand
instead
of
thwarting
it
and
thus
have
a
valuable
effect
upon
life
then
the
maintains
its
and
is
so
far
validated
this
is
the
universal
method
of
testing
assertions
alike
in
the
formation
of
mathematical
laws
physical
hypotheses
religious
beliefs
and
ethical
postulates
hence
such
pragmatic
aphorisms
as
is
useful
or
is
a
matter
of
practical
consequences
mean
essentially
that
all
assertions
must
be
by
being
applied
to
a
real
problem
of
what
is
signified
by
such
statements
is
that
no
must
be
accepted
merely
on
account
of
the
insistence
of
its
claim
but
that
every
idea
must
be
tested
by
the
consequences
of
its
working
its
truth
will
then
depend
upon
those
consequences
being
fruitful
for
life
in
general
and
in
particular
for
the
purpose
behind
the
particular
inquiry
in
which
it
arose
truth
is
a
and
a
satisfaction
but
satisfaction
is
not
a
morbid
delight
in
dialectical
and
verbal
juggling
it
is
the
satisfaction
which
rewards
the
hard
labour
of
rationalizing
experience
and
rendering
it
more
conformable
with
human
desires
it
should
be
clear
though
it
is
often
misunderstood
that
there
is
nothing
arbitrary
or
in
this
method
of
testing
beliefs
it
does
not
mean
that
we
are
free
to
assert
the
truth
of
every
idea
which
seems
to
us
pretty
or
pleasant
the
very
term
was
chosen
by
pragmatists
as
a
protest
against
the
common
philosophic
licence
of
alleging
which
could
never
be
applied
or
tested
and
were
supposed
to
be
none
the
worse
for
being
it
is
clear
both
that
such
must
be
a
monopoly
of
intellectualism
and
also
that
they
do
allow
every
man
to
believe
whatever
he
wishes
provided
only
that
he
boldly
claims
for
his
idiosyncrasy
in
this
purely
subjective
sense
into
which
intellectualism
is
driven
it
is
however
clear
that
there
can
be
no
useless
ideas
for
any
idea
anyone
decided
to
adopt
because
it
pleased
or
amused
him
would
be
true
pragmatism
therefore
by
refuting
knowledge
shows
that
it
does
admit
such
merely
subjective
it
insists
that
ideas
must
be
more
objectively
useful
by
showing
ability
to
cope
with
the
situation
they
were
devised
to
meet
if
they
fail
to
harmonize
with
the
situation
they
are
untrue
however
attractive
they
may
be
for
ideas
do
not
function
in
a
void
they
have
to
work
in
a
world
of
fact
and
to
adapt
themselves
to
all
facts
though
they
may
succeed
in
transforming
them
in
the
end
nor
has
an
idea
to
reckon
only
with
facts
it
has
also
to
cohere
with
other
ideas
it
must
be
congruous
with
the
mass
of
other
beliefs
held
for
good
reasons
by
the
thinker
who
accepts
it
for
no
one
can
afford
to
have
a
stock
of
beliefs
which
conflict
too
violently
with
those
of
his
fellows
if
his
contrast
too
seriously
with
those
of
others
and
he
acts
on
them
he
will
be
shut
up
as
a
lunatic
if
then
the
idea
has
to
approve
itself
both
to
its
maker
and
his
fellows
without
developing
limitations
in
its
use
it
is
clear
that
a
pragmatic
truth
is
really
far
less
arbitrary
and
subjective
than
the
accepted
as
absolute
on
the
bare
ground
that
they
seem
to
a
few
intellectualists
if
however
it
be
urged
that
pragmatic
truths
never
grow
absolutely
true
at
all
and
that
the
most
prolonged
pragmatic
tests
do
not
exclude
the
possibility
of
an
ultimate
error
in
the
idea
there
is
no
difficulty
about
admitting
this
the
pragmatic
test
yields
and
not
certainty
the
existence
of
absolute
certainty
is
denied
and
the
demand
for
it
in
a
world
which
contains
only
the
practical
sort
merely
plays
into
the
hands
of
scepticism
the
uncertainty
of
all
our
verificatory
processes
however
is
not
the
creation
of
the
pragmatist
nor
is
he
a
god
to
abolish
it
abstractly
there
is
always
a
doubt
about
what
transcends
our
immediate
experience
and
this
is
why
it
is
so
healthy
to
have
to
repudiate
so
many
theoretic
doubts
in
every
act
we
do
for
beliefs
have
to
be
acted
on
and
the
results
of
the
action
rightly
react
on
the
beliefs
the
pragmatic
test
is
practically
adequate
and
is
the
only
one
available
that
it
brings
out
the
risk
of
action
only
brings
out
its
superiority
to
a
theory
which
can
not
get
started
at
all
until
it
is
supplied
with
absolute
certainty
and
meantime
can
only
idly
rail
at
all
existing
human
truths
we
have
in
all
this
consistently
referred
the
truth
of
ideas
to
individual
experiences
for
verification
this
evidently
makes
all
truths
in
some
sense
dependent
upon
the
personality
of
those
who
assert
and
accept
them
intellectualist
logic
on
the
other
hand
has
always
proclaimed
that
mental
processes
if
true
are
of
the
idiosyncrasies
of
particular
minds
ideas
have
a
meaning
and
cohere
in
bodies
of
truth
quite
irrespective
of
whether
any
particular
mind
harbours
them
or
not
this
is
not
only
a
contention
fatal
to
the
pragmatic
claims
but
also
bound
up
with
other
assumptions
of
formal
logic
so
it
becomes
necessary
to
inquire
whether
this
logic
is
a
success
and
so
can
coherently
abstract
from
the
personality
of
the
knower
and
the
particular
situations

incite
him
to

theory

judgment

its
asserting

the
failure
of
formal
logic
in
order
to
escape
the
necessity
of
concerning
itself
with
personality
and
particular
circumstances
in
questions
of
truth
and
error
intellectualism
appeals
to
logic
which
it
conceives
as
a
purely
formal
science
and
its
impregnable
citadel
this
appeal
however
rests
on
a
number
of
questionable
assumptions
and
most
of
these
are
not
avowed
it
assumes
that
forms
of
thought
can
be
treated
in
abstraction
from
their
matter
in
other
words
that
the
general
types
of
thinking
are
never
affected
by
the
particular
context
in
which
they
occur
now
this
means
that
the
question
of
real
truth
must
not
be
raised
for
as
we
have
seen
chapter
real
truth
is
always
an
affair
of
particular
consequences
the
result
is
that
as
are
no
longer
tested
they
pass
as
for
logic
and
are
even
raised
to
the
rank
of
truths
or
are
mistaken
for
them
for
the
notion
of
a
really
true
judgment
which
someone
has
chosen
made
and
tested
there
is
substituted
that
of
a
formally
valid
proposition
and
in
the
end
logic
gets
so
involved
in
the
study
of
that
it
puts
aside
altogether
all
real
tests
of
truth
and
becomes
a
game
with
verbal
symbols
which
is
entirely
irrelevant
to
scientific
thinking
formal
logic
assumes
the
right
of
abstracting
from
the
whole
process
of
making
an
assertion
it
presumes
that
the
assertion
has
already
been
made
somehow
how
it
does
not
inquire
yet
it
is
clear
that
in
each
case
there
were
concrete
reasons
why
just
assertion
was
preferred
to
any
other
these
concrete
reasons
it
makes
bold
to
dismiss
as
and
between
and
f
it
decrees
an
absolute
divorce
where
when
why
by
and
to
whom
an
assertion
was
made
is
taken
to
be
irrelevant
and
put
aside
as
this
convenient
assumption
however
ultimately
necessitates
an
abstraction
from
meaning
though
formal
logic
does
not
avow
this
openly
every
assertion
is
meant
to
convey
a
certain
meaning
in
a
certain
context
and
therefore
its
verbal
has
to
take
on
its
own
individual
of
meaning
what
any
particular
form
of
words
does
in
fact
mean
on
any
particular
occasion
always
depends
upon
the
use
of
the
words
in
a
particular
context
meaning
therefore
can
not
be
depersonalized
if
meanings
are
depersonalized
they
cease
to
be
real
and
become
verbal
formal
logic
has
in
fact
mistaken
which
are
within
the
same
language
identical
on
all
occasions
for
the
they
are
intended
to
express
which
are
varied
to
suit
each
occasion
words
alone
are
tolerant
of
the
abstract
treatment
formal
logic
demands
this
therefore
finally
reduces
to
mere
verbalism
distracted
by
inconsistent
relapses
into
but
will
this
conception
of
logic
either
work
out
consistently
in
itself
or
lead
to
a
tenable
theory
of
scientific
thinking
emphatically
not
what
is
the
use
of
a
logic
which
can
not
effect
the
capital
distinction
of
all
thought
that
between
the
true
and
the
false
is
debarred
by
its
own
principles
from
considering
the
of
any
real
assertion
and
is
thus
tossed
helplessly
from
horn
to
horn
of
the
dilemma
verbalism
or
psychology
we
may
select
a
few
examples
of
this
fatal
dilemma
in
dealing
with
what
it
calls
meaning
of
terms
propositions
formal
logic
has
always
to
choose
between
the
meaning
of
the
and
the
meaning
of
the
for
it
is
clear
that
words
which
may
be
used
ambiguously
may
on
occasion
leave
no
doubt
as
to
their
meaning
while
conversely
all
may
become
in
a
context
if
therefore
the
occasion
is
abstracted
from
all
forms
must
be
treated
verbally
as
ambiguous
formulae
which
may
be
used
in
different
senses
if
it
is
nevertheless
attempted
to
deal
with
their
actual
meaning
on
any
given
occasion
what
its
maker
meant
the
words
to
convey
must
be
discovered
and
the
inquiry
at
once
becomes
that
is
to
say
if
judgments
are
not
to
be
verbal
but
real
assertions
which
are
actually
meant
they
must
proceed
from
personal
selections
and
must
have
been
chosen
from
among
alternative
formulations
because
of
their
superior
value
for
their
maker
purpose
but
all
this
is
plainly
an
affair
of
psychology
so
inevitable
is
this
that
a
truly
formal
ideal
of
would
exclude
all
judgment
whatever
from
the
complete
system
of
truth
for
from
such
a
system
no
part
could
be
rightly
extracted
to
stand
alone
such
a
selection
could
be
effected
and
justified
only
by
the
exigencies
of
a
human
thinker
the
impotent
verbalism
of
the
formal
treatment
of
judgment
appears
in
another
way
when
the
question
is
raised
a
judgment
is
to
be
distinguished
from
a
for
the
logician
if
his
public
will
not
accept
either
the
relegation
of
this
distinction
to
or
the
proper
formal
answer
that
judgments
are
formally
and
even
can
think
of
nothing
better
to
say
than
that
if
the
is
not
true
it
was
not
a
judgment
but
a
false
which
may
be
abandoned

he
is
not
concerned
to
help
men
to
discriminate
between
and
or
even
to
show
that

in

inference
involves
formal
logic
in
a
host
of
difficulties
a
if
it
is
not
to
be
a
verbal
manipulation
of
phrases
whose
coming
together
is
not
inquired
into
it
must
be
a
connected
train
of
thought
but
such
a
connection
of
thoughts
can
not
be
conceived
or
understood
without
reference
to
the
purpose
of
a
reasoner
who
what
he
requires
from
the
totality
of
if
then
has
merely
to
contemplate
this
eternal
and
immutable
system
of
truth
in
its
integrity
and
forbids
all
selection
from
it
for
a
merely
human
purpose
how
can
it
either
justify
or
even
understand
the
drawing
of
any
inference
whatever
formal
logic
clearly
will
not
quail
before
the
charge
of
uselessness
but
on
its
own
principles
it
ought
to
be
consistent
but
by
this
test
also
when
it
is
rigorously
judged
by
it
it
fails
completely
its
inconsistencies
are
many
and
incurable
it
can
not
even
be
consistent
in
its
theory
of
the
simplest
fundamentals
it
is
found
upon
some
occasions
to
define
judgment
as
that
which
may
be
true
false
and
upon
others
as
that
which
is
formally
it
can
not
decide
whether
or
not
to
ignore
the
existence
of
error
the
formal
view
of
inference
regards
it
as
a
an
inference
is
required
on
the
one
hand
to
supply
fresh
information
and
on
the
other
to
follow
rigorously
from
its
premisses
it
must
in
a
word
exhibit
both
and
it
would
seem
however
that
if
our
inference
genuinely
had
imparted
new
knowledge
the
event
must
be
merely
psychological
for
how
can
any
process
or
event
perturb
or
add
to
the
completed
totality
of
truth
in
itself
on
the
other
hand
if
the
of
the
operation
be
taken
seriously
the
becomes
illusory
for
if
the
conclusion
inferred
is
already
contained
in
the
premisses
what
sense
is
there
in
the
purely
verbal
process
of
drawing
it
out
most
glaringly
inadequate
of
all
however
is
the
formal
doctrine
of
contained
in
its
theory
of
the
syllogism
a
formal
or
verbal
syllogism
depends
essentially
on
the
ability
of
its
middle
term
to
connect
the
terms
in
its
conclusion
if
however
the
middle
term
has
not
meaning
in
the
two
premisses
the
syllogism
breaks
in
two
and
no
conclusion
can
be
reached
now
whether
in
fact
any
particular
middle
term
bears
the
same
meaning
in
any
actual
reasoning
formal
logic
has
debarred
itself
from
inquiring
by
deciding
that
actual
meaning
was
it
has
to
be
content
therefore
with
an
identity
the
employed
for
its
middle
but
this
evidence
may
always
fail
for
when
two
premisses
which
are
in
general
are
brought
together
for
the
purpose
of
drawing
a
particular
conclusion
a
glaring
falsehood
may
result
it
would
in
general
be
granted
that
sinks
in
water
yet
it
does
not
follow
that
because
ship
is
iron
it
will
in
water
hence
syllogistic
seems
quite
devoid
of
the
it
claimed
after
a
conclusion
has
been
has
still
to
come
true
in
this
flaw
in
the
syllogism
was
first
pointed
out
by
alfred
sidgwick
the
formal
syllogism
moreover
conceals
another
formal
flaw
an
infinite
regress
lurks
in
its
bosom
for
if
its
premisses
are
disputed
they
must
in
turn
be
four
fresh
premisses
are
needed
and
if
these
again
are
challenged
the
number
of
true
premisses
needed
to
prove
the
first
conclusion
goes
on
doubling
at
every
step
the
only
way
to
stop
the
process
that
occurred
to
logicians
was
an
appeal
to
the
truth
of
but
this
has
been
shown
to
be
argumentatively
worthless
from
this
difficulty
the
pragmatist
alone
escapes
by
assuming
his
premisses
and
arguing
in
order
to
test
them
by
their
consequences
if
the
deduced
conclusion
can
be
verified
in
fact
the
premisses
grow
more
assured
thus
every
real
inference
is
an
experiment
and
is
an
affair
of
continuous
trial
and
verification
not
an
infinite
falling
back
upon
an
elusive
but
an
infinite
reaching
forwards
towards
a
fuller
consummation
so
long
as
the
logician
regards
his
premisses
not
as
hypotheses
to
be
tested
but
as
established
truths
he
must
condemn
the
syllogism
as
a
formal
fallacy
it
is
inevitably
a
if
the
argument
men
are
mortal
smith
is
a
man
therefore
smith
is
mortal
means
that
we
know
before
drawing
our
inference
that
literally
all
men
are
mortal
we
must
already
have
discovered
that
smith
is
mortal
if
we
did
not
know
beforehand
that
smith
is
mortal
we
were
not
justified
in
stating
that
men
are
mortal
nor
is
it
an
escape
to
interpret
men
are
mortal
to
mean
that
immortals
are
excluded
from
by
definition
for
then
the
question
is
merely
begged
in
the
minor
premiss
that
is
a
man
can
not
be
asserted
without
assuming
that
he
is
mortal
if
lastly
men
are
mortal
be
taken
to
state
a
law
of
nature
conjoining
inseparably
mortality
and
humanity
the
logician
either
already
knows
that
smith
is
rightly
classed
under
the
species
and
so
subject
to
its
mortality
or
else
he
this
but
how
does
he
know
smith
is
not
like
elijah
or
tithonus
a
peculiar
case
to
which
for
some
reason
the
law
does
not
apply
will
he
declare
it
to
be
certain
that
whatever
is
called
or
looks
like
a
case
of
a
becomes
one
the
logician
analysis
of
reasoning
then
breaks
down
in
whichever
way
he
interprets
the
syllogism
it
is
revealed
as
either
a
superfluity
or
a
fallacy
it
is
never
a
valid
inference
that
can
compel
assent
but
common
sense
is
undismayed
by
the
pragmatist
discovery
that
if
the
syllogism
is
to
have
any
sense
its
premisses
be
taken
as
disputable
for
unlike
formal
logic
it
has
perceived
that
men
do
not
reason
about
what
they
think
they
know
for
certain
but
about
matters
in
dispute
it
is
not
necessary
to
dwell
at
length
on
the
futility
of
the
formal
notion
of
induction
formal
induction
presupposes
that
enough
particular
instances
have
been
collected
to
establish
a
general
rule
but
in
actual
practice
inductions
always
repose
not
on
indiscriminate
observation
but
on
a
of
relevant
and
never
claim
to
be
based
upon
an
knowledge
of
particulars
hence
the
most
satisfactory
induction
is
always
incomplete
and
differs
in
no
wise
from
a
bad
one
bodies

to
the
ground
is
an
induction
which

swans

down
when

were
discovered
in

the
validity
of
an
induction
then
is
not
a
question
of
form
the
necessity
for
such
selection
no
intellectualist
theory
of
induction
has
understood
all
have
aimed
at
exhaustiveness
and
imagined
that
if
it
could
be
attained
inductive
reasoning
would
be
rendered
sound
and
not
impossible

ideal
was
the
totality
of
reality

with
its
in
a
meaningless
tautology
nothing
but
voluntarism
can
enable
logicians
to
see
that
our
actual
procedure
in
knowing
is
the
reverse
of
this
that
causal
explanation
is
the
of
a
continuum
and
that
and
are
all
creations
of
our
selective
attention
that
in
selecting
them
we
run
a
risk
of
analyzing
falsely

that

we
do

be
worthless
but
whether
they
are
right
or
wrong

or

from
can
never
be
a
valid
process
we
are
thus
brought
to
see
the
hollowness
of
the
contention
that
reason
can
ignore
its
psychological
context
and
dehumanize
itself
a
thought

all

purposes
in
the
situation
in
which
it
arises
it
must

chapter

the
bankruptcy
of
intellectualism
we
have
now
struggled
through
the
quagmires
of
intellectualist
philosophy
and
found
that
neither
in
its
psychology
which
divided
the
mind
integrity
into
a
heap
of
faculties
and
comminuted
it
into
a
of
sensations
nor
in
its
epistemology
which
ignored
the
will
to
know
and
the
value
of
knowing
nor
in
its
logic
which
abstracted
thought
wholly
from
the
thinking
and
the
thinker
and
so
finally
from
all
meaning
could
man
find
a
practicable
route
of
philosophic
progress
but
our
struggles
will
not
have
been
in
vain
if
they
have
left
us
with
a
willingness
to
try
the
pragmatist
alternative
and
convinced
us
that
it
is
not
a
wanton
innovation
but
the
only
path
of
salvation
for
the
scientific
spirit
but
before
we
venture
on
it
it
will
be
well
to
restore
confidence
in
the
solvency
of
human
thought
by
analysing
the
causes
of
the
bankruptcy
of
intellectualism
and
exposing
the
extravagance
of
the
assumptions
which
conducted
to
it
was
it
not
after
all
an
unwarranted
assumption
that
severed
the
intellect
from
its
natural
connection
with
human
activity
no
doubt
it
seemed
to
simplify
the
problem
to
suppose
that
the
functioning
of
the
intellect
could
be
studied
as
a
thing
apart
and
unrelated
to
the
general
context
of
the
vital
functions
again
it
was
to
simplify
to
assume
that
thought
could
be
considered
apart
from
the
personality
of
the
human
thinker
but
it
should
not
have
been
forgotten
that
it
is
possible
to
pay
too
dearly
for
simplifications
and
abstractions
and
that
they
all
involve
a
risk
which
the
event
may
show
should
never
have
been
taken
so
it
is
in
this
case
its
rash
assumptions
confront
intellectualism
with
a
host
of
problems
it
can
not
attack
it
can
do
nothing
to
assuage
the
conflict
of
opinions
which
all
claim
truth
with
equal
confidence
it
can
not
understand
the
correction
of
error
which
is
continually
proceeding
nor
can
it
understand
either
the
existence
of
error
or
the
meaning
of
truth
or
the
means
of
distinguishing
between
them
it
has
no
means
of
testing
and
confuting
even
the
wildest
and
maddest
assertions
it
can
not
discriminate
between
the
intuitions
of
the
sage
and
of
the
lunatic
it
is
forced
to
view
energy
of
will
in
knowing
as
a
source
merely
of
corruption
and
when
it
finds
that
as
a
psychic
fact
willing
is
ineradicable
it
must
conclude
that
we
are
constitutionally
incapable
of
that
passive
reflection
of
reality
which
it
regards
as
the
qua
of
truth
hence
if
disinterestedness
is
the
condition
of
knowing
knowledge
is
impossible
and
it
is
so
entangled
in
its
unintelligible
theory
of
truth
as
a
copying
of
reality
that
rather
than
renounce
it
when
it
finds
that
human
knowing
is
copying
it
prefers
a
surrender
to
scepticism
yet
is
not
its
whole
procedure
a
signal
example
of
human
arbitrariness
and
perversity
we
professed
to
be
impelled
by
logical
necessity
at
every
step
but
were
free
to
escape
from
all
our
perplexities
by
adopting
the
pragmatic
inferences
from
them
the
pragmatic
method
of
observing
the
consequences
readily
suggests
the
means
of
discriminating
between
truth
and
error
of
sifting
values
and
of
testing
claims
and
though
not
infallible
it
is
adequate
to
all
our
needs
the
pragmatic
notion
that
is
closes
the
artificial
gulf
between
the
theoretic
and
the
practical
side
of
life
and
assigns
to
truth
a
biological
function
and
vital
value
the
humanist
contention
that
is
rescues
man
from
the
despondency
in
which
his
failure
to
grasp
absolute
truth
had
left
him
the
protagorean
dictum
that
is
the
measure
of
all
assures
him
that
knowledge
may
become
adequate
to
reality
and
that
the
value
of
truths
and
the
differences
between
truth
and
error
also
are
susceptible
of
estimation
true
this
policy
averts
the
bankruptcy
of
the
intellect
by
scaling
down
the
intolerable
charges
on
it
true
practical
knowledge
is
not
absolute
but
if
it
is
enough
to
live
by
is
it
not
better
to
live
by
it
than
to
be
lured
on
to
perish
in
the
deserts
of
scepticism
by
the
of
an
absolute
truth
not
humanly
attainable
true
verification
is
not
but
as
its
conclusions
are
not
incorrigible
its
defects
are
not
fatal
and
its
demands
are
not
impracticable
true
no
truth
and
no
reality
are
wholly
in
the
sense
of
wholly
indifferent
to
our
action
but
to
say
that
the
human
and
factor
in
all
knowledge
must
be
taken
into
account
does
not
preclude
our
apprehending
and
measuring
an
world
as
real
as
and
more
knowable
than
any
other
theory
can
offer
thus
the
proposals
of
pragmatism
for
reconstructing
the
business
of
the
intellect
and
rescuing
it
from
the
bankruptcy
of
intellectualism
are
not
unreasonable
they
open
out
to
it
a
prospect
of
recovering
its
credit
and
its
usefulness
by
returning
to
the
service
of
life
chapter
viii
thought
and
life
the
mission
of
pragmatism
is
to
bring
philosophy
into
relation
to
real
life
and
action
so
far
from
regarding
thought
as
a
activity
pragmatism
insists
upon
replacing
it
in
its
context
among
the
other
functions
of
life
and
in
measuring
its
value
by
its
effect
upon
them
so
far
again
from
regarding
the
abstract
intellect
as
a
vast
juggernaut
machine
which
absorbs
and
crushes
the
individual
thinker
it
treats
him
individually
as
having
his
own
constitution
and
intrinsic
interest
and
credits
him
with
a
power
to
make
new
truths
and
to
enrich
the
resources
of
thought
each
thinker
has
before
him
an
individual
situation
a
system
of
aims
and
values
a
stock
of
knowledge
and
of
means
from
which
he
must
select
what
is
relevant
to
his
ends
and
so
can
not
escape
in
any
judgment
from
the
responsibilities
of
a
personal
decision
thus
for
pragmatism
thought
is
an
with
a
person
behind
it
who
is
responsible
for
launching
it
into
the
world
of
fact
the
result
of
this
change
of
attitude
is
immediate
in
the
first
place
as
has
been
shown
in
chapter
by
bringing
thought
face
to
face
with
the
whole
experience
upon
which
it
claims
to
work
we
are
enabled
to
find
a
tangible
rule
for
evaluating
its
assertions
and
distinguishing
truth
from
error
and
secondly
by
recognizing
that
the
mind
is
not
an
apparatus
which
functions
in
a
vacuum
but
is
a
constituent
of
an
individual
organism
we
see
that
thinking
always
depends
upon
a
purpose
for
it
is
the
purpose
of
an
inquiry
which
gives
reflection
its
cue
and
determines
its
scope
and
most
essential
of
all
its
meaning
we
are
thus
led
from
the
narrower
logical
question
constitutes
the
truth
of
a
statement
to
a
wider
outlook
from
which
we
can
survey
the
place
of
knowing
in
human
life
at
large
this
may
be
called
the
transition
from
pragmatism
to
humanism
this
last
word
was
introduced
into
philosophic
terminology
by
schiller
in
order
to
describe
his
general
philosophical
position
as
distinct
from
the
original
question
of
the
theory
of
knowledge
which
had
been
treated
by
james
under
the
name
of
pragmatism
to
the
humanist
the
best
definition
of
life
is
one
which
displays
it
as
throughout
purposive
as
a
rational
pursuit
of
ends
this
raises
the
question
of
the
validity
of
valuations
valuation
is
a
widespread
human
practice
in
their
most
general
aspect
we
classify
all
objects
as
and
according
as
they
are
ends
to
be
pursued
or
avoided
or
means
which
further
or
frustrate
the
pursuit
of
ends
this
general
antithesis
between
the
and
the
has
numerous
specific
forms
applicable
to
different
departments
of
human
activity
thus
in
conduct
actions
are
judged
or
and
or
in
thinking
ideas
are
or
and
or
for
art
objects
are
or
and
so
forth
for
the
modes
of
valuation
in
life
are
innumerable
any
one
of
these
adjectives
either
denotes
value
or
censures
lack
of
worth
and
each
gets
its
meaning
by
reference
to
the
specific
purpose
moral
aesthetic
or
intellectual
it
appeals
to
the
or
supreme
good
will
then
be
the
ideal
of
the
harmonious
satisfaction
of
all
purposes
what
then
from
the
standpoint
of
humanism
is
the
function
of
in
our
life
they
indicate
a
relation
to
the
cognitive
end
what
is
this
end
surely
not
a
truth
that
is
merely
true
in
itself
has
no
interest
for
human
life
and
no
human
mind
has
an
interest
in
discovering
and
affirming
it
truth
therefore
can
not
stand
aloof
from
life
it
must
somehow
subserve
our
vital
purposes
but
how
shall
it
do
this
only
by
becoming
applicable
to
the
reality
we
have
to
live
with
by
becoming
useful
for
the
changes
we
desire
to
effect
in
it
whoever
will
not
admit
this
and
renders
truth
inapplicable
does
in
fact
render
it
unmeaning
the
fact
that
thought
essentially
refers
to
a
external
to
it
in
no
way
diminishes
its
purposive
character
whether
the
mind
is
idealizing
an
aspect
of
reality
as
in
mathematics
or
abstracting
classifying
and
predicting
as
in
science
it
is
always
the
fact
that
a
particular
kind
of
reality
is
needed
for
some
serious
or
trivial
purpose
which
guides
the
operations
of
the
thinker
a
mind
which
craved
to
embrace
all
or
reality
need
not
it
would
do
better
to
float
without
discrimination
upon
the
flux
of
change
this
procedure
would
be
so
absolutely
antithetical
to
human
knowing
that
it
seems
a
wanton
paradox
on
that
account
to
treat
it
as
the
final
goal
of
knowledge
actually
of
course
the
philosophers
who
claim
to
be
devoted
to
pure
theory
follow
no
such
course
they
deliberately
choose
their
ideal
of
what
is
worth
knowing
or
unity
of
all
things
or
laws
of
the
universe
and
disregarding
all
other
existences
they
pursue
the
kind
of
reality
they
desire
because
of
its
religious
or
moral
or
aesthetic
value
for
there
could
be
no
greater
mistake
than
to
suppose
that
the
common
antithesis
between
and
the
usually
means
the
same
thing
as
the
distinction
between
what
and
what
is
absolutely
on
the
contrary
it
is
usually
a
judgment
of
value
we
may
say
that
the
house
is
real
and
the
is
not
but
as
an
hallucination
the
ghost
is
real
enough
utopia
is
unreal
for
the
politician
but
exists
as
an
ideal
for
the
theorist
the
platonist
treats
our
physical
world
of
sight
and
touch
which
we
think
the
most
real
of
all
as
a
mere
illusion
compared
to
the
of
his
metaphysical
world
the
thinker
who
declares
he
wants
to
know
all
about
does
not
mean
that
he
wishes
to
investigate
which
in
any
sense
exists
but
that
he
wishes
to
know
what
considers
worth
and
this
of
course
implies
a
personal
valuation
a
purged
and
expurgated
extract
which
will
not
offend
his
taste
so
all
philosophies
are
in
fact
selective
even
the
more
conscientious
rationalists
show
very
little
anxiety
to
include
in
their
intellectual
scheme
a
knowledge
of
their
opponents
opinions
indeed
they
seem
to
think
that
the
existence
of
such
facts
may
be
made
dependent
wholly
on
their
will
to
recognize
them
an
exposition
of
pragmatism
is
for
them
a
which
does
not
count
it
is
not
worth
knowing
about
and
this
is
only
natural
after
all
for
the
object
of
the
mind
search
is
always
a
selection
conceived
after
the
likeness
of
the
heart
desire
the
product
of
a
human
purpose
to
recognize
this
is
to
appreciate
the
wisdom
of
humanism
refusal
to
treat
the
world
for
good
or
bad
as
a
given
and
completed
whole
for
not
only
is
what
we
call
the
real
world
always
a
selection
from
a
larger
whole
from
which
we
have
ventured
to
exclude
great
masses
of
irrelevance
but
every
day
brings
fresh
experience
and
may
bring
fresh
enlightenment
and
since
man
has
always
an
interest
in
improving
his
condition
is
it
not
futile
to
forbid
him
to
his
world
as
beat
he
can
why
prematurely
claim
to
have
reached
finality
when
unexpected
novelties
may
shatter
any
system
before
it
is
even
completed
our
world
is
plastic
it
is
most
what
we
can
make
of
it
and
the
process
of
our
making
is
not
ended
whether
a
decree
of
fate
has
fixed
any
ultimate
limits
to
our
efforts
we
have
no
means
of
knowing
and
no
occasion
to
assume
is
not
our
wisest
course
then
to
persist
in
trying
it
is
bad
method
ever
to
despair
of
knowing
what
we
need
for
good
or
ill
the
world
with
which
the
humanist
contends
is
always
a
world
that
reveals
itself
to
him
reality
as
it
is
assumed
presumed
or
guessed
to
be
itself
apart
from
our
experience
of
it
is
cancelled
from
his
reckonings
for
he
can
not
discover
how
he
or
anyone
can
get
any
or
which
transcends
all
human
faculties
the
theories
of
metaphysicians
on
these
lofty
themes
he
regards
as
personal
postulates
which
in
so
far
as
they
can
not
be
subjected
to
the
pragmatic
method
must
remain
open
questions
human
experience
does
not
warrant
such
gratuitous
demands
it
confirms
neither
the
rigid
system
of
unchanging
fact
which
realism
postulates
seeing
that
the
only
facts
that
science
speaks
of
are
ever
changing
in
its
progress
nor
finds
its
problems
conflicts
and
errors
credible
as
a
reflexion
of
any
universal
mind
unless
idealism
ultimately
repudiates
the
sanity
of
its
absolute
the
superiority
of
humanism
then
lies
in
this
that
it
does
not
discourage
human
enterprise
by
assuming
that
the
real
is
completely
rigid
and
eternally
achieved
without
regard
to
human
effort
in
the
drama
that
unrolls
reality
every
man
it
teaches
has
a
duty
and
a
power
to
play
his
humble
but
essential
part
humanism
is
neither
an
optimism
nor
a
pessimism
both
of
which
must
consistently
in
their
extreme
form
deny
that
reality
can
be
improved
but
concedes
to
man
the
right
and
duty
to
improve
the
world
it
impresses
us
with
the
necessity
of
acting
it
vindicates
the
procedure
of
acting
on
our
hopes
it
shows
us
how
we
may
correct
our
errors
and
so
gives
reasons
for
our
faith
in
the
possibility
