chapter
i
sennacherib
struggle
of
sennacherib
with
judæa
and
egypt
destruction
of
sennacherib
either
failed
to
inherit
his
good
fortune
or
lacked
his
ability
he
was
not
deficient
in
military
genius
nor
in
the
energy
necessary
to
withstand
the
various
enemies
who
rose
against
him
at
widely
removed
points
of
his
frontier
but
he
had
neither
the
adaptability
of
character
nor
the
delicate
tact
required
to
manage
successfully
the
heterogeneous
elements
combined
under
his
sway
the
two
principal
documents
for
the
reign
of
sennacherib
are
engraved
on
cylinders
the
taylor
cylinder
and
the
bellino
cylinder
duplicates
of
which
more
or
less
perfect
exist
in
the
collections
of
the
british
museum
the
taylor
cylinder
found
at
kouyunjik
or
contains
the
history
or
the
first
eight
years
of
this
reign
the
bellino
cylinder
treats
of
the
two
first
years
of
the
reign
he
lacked
the
wisdom
to
conciliate
the
vanquished
or
opportunely
to
check
his
own
repressive
measures
he
destroyed
towns
massacred
entire
tribes
and
laid
whole
tracts
of
country
waste
and
by
failing
to
repeople
these
with
captive
exiles
from
other
nations
or
to
import
colonists
in
sufficient
numbers
he
found
himself
towards
the
end
of
his
reign
ruling
over
a
sparsely
inhabited
desert
where
his
father
had
bequeathed
to
him
flourishing
provinces
and
populous
cities
his
was
the
system
of
the
first
assyrian
conquerors
shalmaneser
iii
and
substituted
for
that
of
iii
and
sargon
the
assimilation
of
the
conquered
peoples
to
their
conquerors
was
retarded
tribute
was
no
longer
paid
regularly
and
the
loss
of
revenue
under
this
head
was
not
compensated
by
the
uncertain
increase
in
the
spoils
obtained
by
war
the
recruiting
of
the
army
rendered
more
difficult
by
the
depopulation
of
revolted
districts
weighed
heavier
still
on
those
which
remained
faithful
and
began
as
in
former
times
to
exhaust
the
nation
the
news
of
murder
published
throughout
the
eastern
world
had
rekindled
hope
in
the
countries
recently
subjugated
by
assyria
as
well
as
in
those
hostile
to
her
phoenicia
egypt
media
and
elam
roused
themselves
from
their
lethargy
and
anxiously
awaited
the
turn
which
events
should
take
at
nineveh
and
babylon
sennacherib
did
not
consider
it
to
his
interest
to
assume
the
crown
of
chaldæa
and
to
treat
on
a
footing
of
absolute
equality
a
country
which
had
been
subdued
by
force
of
arms
he
relegated
it
to
the
rank
of
a
vassal
state
and
while
reserving
the
suzerainty
for
himself
sent
thither
one
of
his
brothers
to
rule
as
king
the
events
which
took
place
at
babylon
at
the
beginning
of
reign
are
known
to
us
from
the
fragments
of
berosus
compared
with
the
canon
of
ptolemy
and
babylonian
canon
the
first
interregnum
in
the
canon
of
ptolemy
is
filled
in
canon
by
three
kings
who
are
said
to
have
reigned
as
follows
sennacherib
two
years
one
month
nine
months
berosus
substitutes
for
sennacherib
one
of
his
brothers
whose
name
apparently
he
did
not
know
and
this
is
the
version
i
have
adopted
in
agreement
with
most
modern
historians
as
best
tallying
with
the
evident
lack
of
affection
for
babylon
displayed
by
sennacherib
throughout
his
reign
the
babylonians
were
indignant
at
this
slight
accustomed
to
see
their
foreign
ruler
conform
to
their
national
customs
take
the
hands
of
bel
and
assume
or
receive
from
them
a
new
they
could
not
resign
themselves
to
descend
to
the
level
of
mere
tributaries
in
less
than
two
years
they
rebelled
assassinated
the
king
who
had
been
imposed
upon
them
and
proclaimed
in
his
stead
who
was
merely
the
son
of
a
female
slave
the
servile
origin
of
this
personage
is
indicated
in
babylonian
canon
he
might
however
be
connected
through
his
father
with
a
princely
or
even
a
royal
family
and
thereby
be
in
a
position
to
win
popular
support
among
modern
assyriologists
some
suppose
that
the
name
akises
in
berosus
is
a
corruption
of
zâkir
shumu
others
consider
as
being
the
personal
name
of
the
king
and
his
this
was
the
signal
for
a
general
insurrection
in
chaldæa
and
the
eastern
part
of
the
empire
who
had
remained
in
hiding
in
the
valleys
on
the
elamite
frontier
since
his
defeat
in
suddenly
issued
forth
with
his
adherents
and
marched
at
once
to
babylon
the
very
news
of
his
approach
caused
a
sedition
in
the
midst
of
which
perished
after
having
reigned
for
only
one
month
his
former
capital
and
as
soon
as
he
was
once
more
seated
on
the
throne
he
endeavoured
to
form
alliances
with
all
the
princes
both
small
and
great
who
might
create
a
diversion
in
his
favour
his
envoys
obtained
promises
of
help
from
elam
other
emissaries
hastened
to
syria
to
solicit
the
alliance
of
hezekiah
and
might
have
even
proceeded
to
egypt
if
their
good
fortune
had
lasted
long
enough
but
sennacherib
did
not
waste
his
opportunities
in
kings
xx
isa
xxxix
the
embassy
to
hezekiah
has
been
assigned
to
the
first
reign
of
under
sargon
in
accordance
with
the
information
obtained
from
the
assyrian
monuments
it
seems
to
me
that
it
could
only
have
taken
place
during
his
second
reign
in
the
magnificent
army
left
by
sargon
was
at
his
disposal
and
summoning
it
at
once
into
the
field
he
advanced
on
the
town
of
kîsh
where
the
kaldâ
monarch
was
entrenched
with
his
aramæan
forces
and
the
elamite
auxiliaries
furnished
by
the
battle
issued
in
the
complete
rout
of
the
confederate
forces
fled
almost
unattended
first
to
and
then
to
the
marshes
of
the
tigris
where
he
found
a
temporary
refuge
the
troops
who
were
despatched
in
pursuit
followed
him
for
five
days
and
then
having
failed
to
secure
the
fugitive
gave
up
the
search
the
detail
is
furnished
by
the
berosus
affirmed
that
was
put
to
death
by
belibni
his
camp
fell
into
the
possession
of
the
victor
with
all
its
contents
chariots
horses
mules
camels
and
herds
of
cattle
belonging
to
the
commissariat
department
of
the
army
babylon
threw
open
its
gates
without
resistance
hoping
no
doubt
that
sennacherib
would
at
length
resolve
to
imitate
the
precedent
set
by
his
father
and
retain
the
royal
dignity
for
himself
he
did
indeed
consent
to
remit
the
punishment
for
this
first
insurrection
and
contented
himself
with
pillaging
the
royal
treasury
and
palace
but
he
did
not
deign
to
assume
the
crown
conferring
it
on
belibni
a
babylonian
of
noble
birth
who
had
been
taken
when
quite
a
child
to
nineveh
and
educated
there
under
the
eyes
of
sargon
the
name
is
transcribed
belibos
in
greek
and
it
seems
as
if
the
assyrian
variants
justify
the
pronunciation
belibush
while
he
was
thus
reorganising
the
government
his
generals
were
bringing
the
campaign
to
a
close
they
sacked
one
after
another
strongholds
and
eight
hundred
and
twenty
villages
of
the
kaldâ
they
drove
out
the
arabian
and
aramaean
garrisons
which
had
placed
in
the
cities
of
karduniash
in
urak
nipur
kuta
and
and
they
assyrian
supremacy
over
all
the
tribes
on
the
east
of
the
tigris
up
to
the
frontiers
of
elam
the
tumuna
the
ubudu
the
gambulu
and
the
khindaru
as
also
over
the
nabataeans
and
hagarenes
who
wandered
over
the
deserts
of
arabia
to
the
west
of
the
mouths
of
the
euphrates
the
booty
was
enormous
prisoners
both
male
and
female
horses
asses
camels
oxen
sheep
made
their
way
like
a
gigantic
horde
of
emigrants
to
assyria
under
the
escort
of
the
victorious
army
meanwhile
the
khirimmu
remained
defiant
and
showed
not
the
slightest
intention
to
submit
their
strongholds
had
to
be
attacked
and
the
inhabitants
annihilated
before
order
could
in
any
way
be
restored
in
the
country
the
second
reign
of
had
lasted
barely
nine
months
the
blow
which
ruined
broke
up
the
coalition
which
he
had
tried
to
form
against
assyria
babylon
was
the
only
where
states
so
remote
and
such
entire
strangers
to
each
other
as
judah
and
elam
could
enter
into
friendly
relations
and
arrange
a
plan
of
combined
action
having
lost
babylon
as
a
centre
they
were
once
more
hopelessly
isolated
and
had
no
means
of
concerting
measures
against
the
common
foe
they
renounced
all
offensive
action
and
waited
under
arms
to
see
how
the
conqueror
would
deal
with
each
severally
the
most
threatening
storm
however
was
not
that
which
was
gathering
over
palestine
even
were
egypt
to
be
drawn
into
open
war
for
a
revolt
of
the
western
provinces
however
serious
was
never
likely
to
lead
to
disastrous
complications
and
the
distance
from
pelusium
to
the
tigris
was
too
great
for
a
victory
of
the
pharaoh
to
compromise
effectually
the
safety
of
the
empire
on
the
other
hand
should
intervention
on
the
part
of
elam
in
the
affairs
of
babylon
or
media
be
crowned
with
success
the
most
disastrous
consequences
might
ensue
it
would
mean
the
loss
of
karduniash
or
of
the
frontier
districts
won
with
such
difficulty
by
iii
and
sargon
it
would
entail
permanent
hostilities
on
the
tigris
and
the
zab
and
perhaps
the
appearance
of
barbarian
troops
under
the
walls
of
calah
or
of
nineveh
elam
had
assisted
and
its
soldiers
had
fought
on
the
plains
of
kish
months
had
elapsed
since
that
battle
yet
showed
no
disposition
to
take
the
initiative
he
accepted
his
defeat
at
all
events
for
the
time
but
though
he
put
off
the
day
of
reckoning
till
a
more
favourable
opportunity
it
argued
neither
weakness
nor
discouragement
and
he
was
ready
to
give
a
fierce
reception
to
any
assyrian
monarch
who
should
venture
within
his
domain
sennacherib
knowing
both
the
character
and
resources
of
the
elamite
king
did
not
attempt
to
meet
him
in
the
open
field
but
wreaked
his
resentment
on
the
frontier
tribes
who
had
rebelled
at
the
instigation
of
the
elamites
on
the
cossoans
on
ellipi
and
its
king
ishpabara
he
pursued
the
inhabitants
into
the
narrow
valleys
and
forests
of
the
khoatras
where
his
chariots
were
unable
to
follow
proceeding
with
his
troops
sometimes
on
horseback
at
other
times
on
foot
he
reduced
khardishpi
and
to
ashes
and
annexed
the
territories
of
the
cossoans
and
the
yasubigallâ
to
the
prefecture
of
arrapkha
thence
he
entered
ellipi
where
ishpabara
did
not
venture
to
come
to
close
quarters
with
him
in
the
open
field
but
led
him
on
from
town
to
town
he
destroyed
the
two
royal
seats
of
marubishti
and
akkuddu
and
of
their
dependent
strongholds
he
took
possession
of
zizirtu
kummalu
the
district
of
bitbarru
and
the
city
of
elinzash
to
which
he
gave
the
name
the
fortress
of
sennacherib
and
annexed
them
to
the
government
of
kharkhar
the
distant
medes
disquieted
at
his
advance
sent
him
presents
and
renewed
the
assurances
of
devotion
they
had
given
to
sargon
but
sennacherib
did
not
push
forward
into
their
territory
as
his
predecessors
had
done
he
was
content
to
have
maintained
his
authority
as
far
as
his
outlying
posts
and
to
have
strengthened
the
assyrian
empire
by
acquiring
some
positions
near
the
main
routes
which
led
from
the
iranian
to
the
plains
of
mesopotamia
having
accomplished
this
he
at
once
turned
his
attention
towards
the
west
where
the
spirit
of
rebellion
was
still
active
in
the
countries
bordering
on
the
african
frontier
sabaco
now
undisputed
master
of
egypt
was
not
content
like
piônkhi
to
bring
egypt
proper
into
a
position
of
dependence
and
govern
it
at
a
distance
by
means
of
his
generals
he
took
up
his
residence
within
it
at
least
during
part
of
every
year
and
played
the
rôle
of
pharaoh
so
well
that
his
egyptian
subjects
both
at
thebes
and
in
the
delta
were
obliged
to
acknowledge
his
sovereignty
and
recognise
him
as
the
founder
of
a
new
dynasty
he
kept
a
close
watch
over
the
vassal
princes
placing
garrisons
in
memphis
and
the
other
principal
citadels
and
throughout
the
country
he
took
in
hand
public
works
which
had
been
almost
completely
interrupted
for
more
than
a
century
owing
to
the
civil
wars
the
highways
were
repaired
the
canals
cleaned
out
and
enlarged
and
the
foundations
of
the
towns
raised
above
the
level
of
the
inundation
bubastis
especially
profited
under
his
rule
and
regained
the
ascendency
it
had
lost
ever
since
the
accession
of
the
second
tanite
dynasty
but
this
partiality
was
not
to
the
detriment
of
other
cities
several
of
the
temples
at
memphis
were
restored
and
the
inscriptions
effaced
by
time
were
thebes
happy
under
the
government
of
amenertas
and
her
husband
piônkhi
profited
largely
by
the
liberality
of
its
ethiopian
rulers
at
luxor
sabaco
restored
the
decoration
of
the
principal
gateway
between
the
two
pylons
and
repaired
several
portions
of
the
temple
of
amon
at
karnak
history
subsequently
related
that
in
order
to
obtain
sufficient
workmen
he
substituted
forced
labour
for
the
penalty
of
death
a
policy
which
beside
being
profitable
would
win
for
him
a
reputation
for
clemency
egypt
at
length
reduced
to
peace
and
order
began
once
more
to
flourish
and
to
display
that
inherent
vitality
of
which
she
had
so
often
given
proof
and
her
reviving
prosperity
attracted
as
of
old
the
attention
of
foreign
powers
at
the
beginning
of
his
reign
sabaco
had
attempted
to
meddle
in
the
intrigues
of
syria
but
the
ease
with
which
sargon
had
quelled
the
revolt
of
ashdod
had
inspired
the
egyptian
monarch
with
salutary
distrust
in
his
own
power
he
had
sent
presents
to
the
conqueror
and
received
gifts
in
exchange
which
furnished
him
with
a
pretext
for
enrolling
the
asiatic
peoples
among
the
tributary
nations
whose
names
he
inscribed
on
his
triumphal
lists
since
then
he
had
had
some
diplomatic
correspondence
with
his
powerful
neighbour
and
a
document
bearing
his
name
was
laid
up
in
the
archives
at
calah
where
the
clay
seal
once
attached
to
it
has
been
discovered
peace
had
lasted
for
a
dozen
years
when
he
died
about
and
his
son
shabîtoku
ascended
the
throne
it
was
probably
with
reference
to
this
exchange
of
presents
that
sabaco
caused
the
at
karnak
to
be
engraved
in
which
he
represents
himself
as
victorious
over
both
asiatics
and
africans
one
version
of
manetho
assigns
twelve
years
to
the
reign
of
sabaco
and
this
duration
is
confirmed
by

had

repaired

occasioned

belonged
to

called

of

the
assyrian
texts
similarly
call
elulai
king
of
the

while
menander
mentions
him
as

it

probable
that
the
king
of

mentioned
in

of

side

side
with
the

of

was
a
vassal
of

monarch
the

of

of

the

not

permits
us
with

to
identify

later
shalmaneser

had
returned
to
syria
and
had
come
into
conflict
with
damascus
the
northern
phoenicians
formed
a
league
with
adadidri
to
withstand
him
and
drew
upon
themselves
the
penalty
of
their
rashness
the
tynans
faithful
to
their
usual
policy
preferred
to
submit
voluntarily
and
purchase
peace
their
conduct
showed
the
greater
wisdom
in
that
after
the
death
of
internal
troubles
again
broke
out
with
renewed
fierceness
and
with
even
more
disastrous
results
his
immediate
successor
was
balezor
followed
by
mutton
i
who
flung
himself
at
the
feet
of
shalmaneser
in
in
the
camp
at
baalirasi
and
renewed
his
homage
three
years
later
in
the
legends
concerning
the
foundation
of
carthage
blend
with
our
slight
knowledge
of
his
history
they
attribute
to
mutton
a
daughter
named
elissa
who
was
married
to
her
uncle
sicharbal
high
priest
of
melkarth
and
a
young
son
named
pygmalion
sicharbal
had
been
nominated
by
mutton
as
regent
during
the
minority
of
pygmalion
but
he
was
overthrown
by
the
people
and
some
years
later
murdered
by
his
ward
from
that
time
forward
one
aim
was
to
avenge
the
murder
of
her
husband
she
formed
a
conspiracy
which
was
joined
by
all
the
nobles
but
being
betrayed
and
threatened
with
death
she
seized
a
fleet
which
lay
ready
to
sail
in
the
harbour
and
embarking
with
all
her
adherents
set
sail
for
africa
landing
in
the
district
of
zeugitanê
where
the
sidonians
had
already
built
kambê
there
she
purchased
a
tract
of
land
from
larbas
chief
of

built
on
the
ruins
of
the
ancient
factory
a
new
town
which
the
greeks
called
carchedo
and
the
romans
carthage
the
genius
of
virgil
has
rendered
the
name
of
dido
illustrious
but
history
fails
to
recognise
in
the
narratives
which
form
the
basis
of
his
tale
anything
beyond
a
legendary
account
fabricated
after
the
actual
origin
of
the
great
punic
city
had
been
forgotten
thus
weakened
tyre
could
less
than
ever
think
of
opposing
the
ambitious
designs
of
assyria
pygmalion
took
no
part
in
the
rebellions
of
the
petty
syrian
kings
against
and
in
he
received
his
suzerain
with
the
accustomed
gifts
when
that
king
passed
through
phoenicia
before
attacking
damascus
pygmalion
died
about
and
the
names
of
his
immediate
successors
are
not
known
it
may
be
supposed
however
that
when
the
power
of
nineveh
temporarily
declined
the
ties
which
held
tyre
to
assyria
became
naturally
relaxed
and
the
city
released
herself
from
the
burden
of
a
tribute
which
had
in
the
past
been
very
irregularly
paid
the
fragment
of
menander
has
preserved
for
us
the
list
of
tyrian
kings
from
to
pygmalion
was
only
quoted
by
josephus
because
the
seventh
year
of
reign
corresponding
to
the
date
of
the
foundation
of
carthage
according
to
the
chronological
system
of
timssus
the
hebrew
historian
found
in
it
a
fixed
date
which
seemed
to
permit
of
his
establishing
the
chronology
of
the
kings
of
israel
and
judah
on
a
trustworthy
basis
between
the
reign
of
pygmalion
and
hiram
the
contemporary
of
david
and
solomon
the
yoke
was
reassumed
half
a
century
later
at
the
mere
echo
of
the
first
victories
of
iii
and
hiram
who
then
reigned
in
tyre
hastened
to
carry
to
the
camp
at
arpad
assurances
of
his
fidelity
he
gave
pledges
of
his
allegiance
once
more
in
then
he
disappears
and
mutton
ii
takes
his
place
about
this
king
cast
off
unhappily
for
himself
his
hereditary
apathy
and
as
soon
as
a
pretext
offered
itself
abandoned
the
policy
of
neutrality
to
which
his
ancestors
had
adhered
so
firmly
he
entered
into
an
alliance
in
with
damascus
israel
and
philistia
secretly
supported
and
probably
instigated
by
egypt
then
when
israel
was
conquered
and
damascus
overthrown
he
delayed
repairing
his
error
till
an
assyrian
army
appeared
before
tyre
he
had
then
to
pay
the
price
of
his
temerity
by
talents
of
gold
and
many
loads
of
merchandise
the
punishment
was
light
and
the
loss
inconsiderable
in
comparison
with
the
accumulated
wealth
of
the
city
which
its
maritime
trade
was
daily
increasing
mutton
thought
the
episode
was
closed
but
the
peaceful
policy
of
his
house
having
been
twice
interrupted
could
not
be
resumed
for
a
description
of
the
trade
carried
on
by
tyre
cf
ezelc
and
pygmalion
having
died
about
and
hiram

not
appearing
till
it
is
probable
that
we
should
intercalate
between
these
two
kings
at
least
one
sovereign
whose
name
is
still
unknown
southern
phoenicia
having
once
launched
on
the
stream
of
asiatic
politics
followed
its
fluctuations
and
was
compelled
henceforth
to
employ
in
her
own
defence
the
forces
which
had
hitherto
been
utilised
in
promoting
her
colonial
enterprises
but
it
was
not
due
to
the
foolish
caprice
of
ignorant
or
rash
sovereigns
that
tyre
renounced
her
former
neutral
policy
she
was
constrained
to
do
so
almost
perforce
by
the
changes
which
had
taken
place
in
europe
the
progress
of
the
greeks
and
their
triumph
in
the
waters
of
the
ægean
and
ionian
seas
and
the
rapid
expansion
of
the
etruscan
navy
after
the
end
of
the
ninth
century
had
gradually
restricted
the
phoenician
merchantmen
to

coasts
of

industriously
exploited
the
mineral
wealth
of

the
barbarous
tribes
of
morocco

as
well
as
the
discovery

largely
compensated
for

losses
occasioned
by

closing
of

the

of
sennacherib
a
hybrid
civilisation
had
developed
among
these
early
greek
settlers
amalgamating
the
customs
religions
and
arts
of
the
ancient
eastern
world
of
egypt
syria
and
chaldoa
in
variable
proportions
their
script
was
probably
derived
from
one
of
the
asianic
systems
whose
monuments
are
still
but
partly
known
and
it
consisted
of
a
syllabary
awkwardly
adapted
to

language
for
which
it
had
not
been
designed

dozen
petty
kings

the
name
of

city
at
first
read
as
amtikhadashti

identified
with
ammokhostos

with
amathous
would
in
this
case
be
equivalent
to
is
really
as
is
proved
by
the
variant
reading
discovered
by
schrader
and
this
is
identical
with
the
native
name

in
africa
this
new
city
must
have
been
of
some
antiquity
by
the
time
of
elulai
for
it
is
mentioned
on
a
fragment
of
a
bronze
vase
found
in
cyprus
itself
this
fragment
belonged
to
a
king
hiram

according
to
some
authorities
would
be
hiram
according
to
others
hiram
successor
elulai
continued
as
we
know
the
work
of
defence
and
conquest
perhaps
it
was
with
a
view
to
checking
his
advance
that
seven
kings
of
cyprus
sent
an
embassy
in
to
his
suzerain
sargon
and
placed
themselves
under
the
protection
of
assyria
if
this
was
actually
the
case
and
elulai
was
compelled
to
suspend
hostilities
against
these
hereditary
foes
one
can
understand
that
this
grievance
added
to
the
reasons
for
uneasiness
inspired
by
the
situation
of
his
continental
dominions
may
have
given
him
the
desire
to
rid
himself
of
the
yoke
of
assyria
and
contributed
to
his
resolution
to
ally
himself
with
the
powers
which
were
taking
up
arms
against
her
the
constant
intercourse
of
his
subjects
with
the
delta
and
his
natural
anxiety
to
avoid
anything
which
might
close
one
of
the
richest
markets
of
the
world
to
the
tyrian
trade
inclined
him
to
receive
favourably
the
overtures
of
the
pharaoh
the
emissaries
of
shabîtoku
found
him
as
much
disposed
as
hezekiah
himself
to
begin
the
struggle
the
latter
monarch
who
had
ascended
the
throne
while
still
very
young
had
at
first
shown
no
ambition
beyond
the
carrying
out
of
religious
reforms
his
father
ahaz
had
been
far
from
orthodox
in
spite
of
the
influence
exerted
over
him
by
isaiah
during
his
visit
to
at
damascus
he
had
noticed
an
altar
whose
design
pleased
him
he
sent
a
description
of
it
to
the
high
priest
urijah
with
orders
to
have
a
similar
one
constructed
and
erected
in
the
court
of
the
temple
at
jerusalem
this
altar
he
appropriated
to
his
personal
use
and
caused
the
priests
to
minister
at
it
instead
of
at
the
old
altar
which
he
relegated
to
an
inferior
position
he
also
effected
changes
in
the
temple
furniture
which
doubtless
appeared
to
him
in
comparison
with
the
splendours
of
the
assyrian
worship
which
he
had
witnessed
and
he
made
some
alterations
in
the
approaches
to
the
temple
wishing
as
far
as
we
can
judge
that
the
king
of
judah
should
henceforth
like
his
brother
of
nineveh
have
a
private
means
of
access
to
his
national
god
this
was
but
the
least
of
his
offences
for
had
he
not
offered
his
own
son
as
a
holocaust
at
the
moment
he
felt
himself
most
menaced
by
the
league
of
israel
and
damascus
among
the
people
themselves
there
were
many
and
faithless
who
doubting
the
power
of
the
god
of
their
forefathers
turned
aside
to
the
gods
of
the
neighbouring
nations
and
besought
from
them
the
succour
they
despaired
of
receiving
from
any
other
source
the
worship
of
jahveh
was
confounded
with
that
of
moloch
in
the
valley
of
the
children
of
hinnom
where
there
was
a
sanctuary
or
tophet
at
which
the
people
celebrated
the
most
horrible
rites
a
large
and
fierce
pyre
was
kept
continually
burning
there
to
consume
the
children
whose
fathers
brought
them
to
offer
in
sacrifice

complains
bitterly
of
these
unbelievers
who
profaned
the
land
with
their
idols

work
of
their
own
hands
that
which
their
own
fingers
had
the
new
king
obedient
to
the
divine
command
renounced
the
errors
of
his
father
he
removed
the
fetishes
with
which
the
superstition
of
his
predecessors
had
cumbered
the
temple
and
which
they
had
connected
with
the
worship
of
jahveh
and
in
his

he
might

had
no

we
may
here
pause
to

how
hezekiah
was
occupied

his
fate
was
being
decided
on
the
field
of
altaku
he
was
fortifying

and
storing
within
it
munitions
of

and
enrolling
jewish
soldiers
and
mercenary
troops
from
the
arab
tribes
of
the
desert
he
had
suddenly
become
aware
that
large
portions
of
the
wall
of
the
city
of
david
had
crumbled
away
and
he
set
about
demolishing
the
neighbouring
houses
to
obtain
materials
for
repairing
these
breaches
he
hastily
strengthened
the
weak
points
in
his
fortifications
stopped
up
the
springs
which
flowed
into
the
gibon
and
cut
off
the
brook
itself
constructing
a
reservoir
between
the
inner
and
outer
city
walls
to
store
up
the
waters
of
the
ancient
pool
these
rendered
the
city
which
from
its
natural
position
was
well
defended
so
impregnable
that
sennacherib
decided
not
to
attack
it
until
the
rest
of
the
kingdom
had
been
subjugated
with
this
object
in
view
he
pitched
his
camp
before
lachish
whence
he
could
keep
a
watch
over
the
main
routes
from
egypt
where
they
crossed
the

then
scattered

forces

overtures
of
peace
and
proposed
a
parley
near
the
conduit
of
the
upper
pool
in
the
highway
of
the
field
hezekiah
did
not
venture
to
go
in
person
to
the
he
sent
eliakirn
the
new
prefect
of
the
palace
shebna
and
the
chancellor
joah
the
chief
cupbearer
and
tradition
relates
that
the
assyrian
addressed
them
in
severe
terms
in
his
name
on
whom
dost
thou
trust
that
thou
rebellest
against
me
behold
thou
trustest
upon
the
staff
of
this
bruised
reed
even
upon
egypt
whereon
if
a
man
lean
it
will
go
into
his
hand
and
pierce
it
so
is
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
to
all
that
trust
on
then
as
he
continued
to
declaim
in
a
loud
voice
so
that
the
crowds
gathered
on
the
wall
could
hear
him
the
delegates
besought
him
to
speak
in
aramaic
which
they
understood
but
not
to
us
in
the
language
in
the
ears
of
the
people
that
are
on
the
wall
instead
however
of
granting
their
request
the
assyrian
general
advanced
towards
the
spectators
and
addressed
them
in
hebrew
ye
the
words
of
the
great
king
the
king
of
assyria
let
not
hezekiah
deceive
you
for
he
shall
not
be
able
to
deliver
you
neither
let
hezekiah
make
you
trust
in
the
lord
saying
the
lord
will
surely
deliver
us
this
city
shall
not
be
given
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
assyria
hearken
not
to
hezekiah
for
thus
saith
the
king
of
assyria
make
your
peace
with
me
and
come
out
to
me
and
eat
ye
every
one
of
his
vine
and
every
one
of
his
fig
tree
and
drink
ye
every
one
the
waters
of
his
own
cistern
until
i
come
and
take
you
away
to
a
land
like
your
own
land
a
land
of
corn
and
wine
a
land
of
bread
and
vineyards
beware
lest
hezekiah
persuade
you
saying
the
lord
will
deliver
us
the
specified
conditions
were
less
hard
than
might
have
been
feared
the
hebrew
version
of
these
events
is
recorded
in
kings
xviii
and
in
isa
with
only
one
important
divergence
namely
the
absence
from
isaiah
of
verses
of
kings
xviii
this
particular
passage
in
which
the
name
of
the
king
has
a
peculiar
form
is
a
detached
fragment
of
an
older
document
perhaps
the
official
annals
of
the
kingdom
whose
contents
agreed
with
the
facts
recorded
in
the
assyrian
text
the
rest
is
borrowed
from
the
cycle
of
prophetic
narratives
and
contains
two
different
versions
of
the
same
events
the
first
comprises
kings
xviii
xix
where
sennacherib
is
represented
as
despatching
a
verbal
message
to
hezekiah
by
the
tartan
and
his
captains
the
second
consists
merely
of
kings
xix
and
in
this
has
been
inserted
a
long
prophecy
of
xix
which
has
but
a
vague
connection
with
the
rest
of
the
narrative
in
this
sennacherib
defied
hezekiah
in
a
letter
which
the
jewish
king
spread
before
the
lord
and
shortly
afterwards
received
a
reply
through
the
prophet
the
two
versions
were
combined
towards
the
end
of
the
seventh
or
beginning
of
the
sixth
century
by
the
compiler
of
the
of
and
passed
thence
into
the
collection
of
the
prophecies
attributed
to
isaiah
the
jewish
king
was
to
give
up
his
wives
and
daughters
as
hostages
to
pledge
himself
to
pay
a
regular
tribute
and
disburse
immediately
a
ransom
of
thirty
talents
of
gold
and
eight
hundred
talents
of
silver
he
could
only
make
up
this
large
sum
by
emptying
the
royal
and
sacred
treasuries
and
taking
down
the
plates
of
gold
with
which
merely
a
short
while
before
he
had
adorned
the
doors
and
lintels
of
the
temple
padî
was
released
from
his
long
captivity
reseated
on
his
throne
and
received
several
jewish
towns
as
an
indemnity
other
portions
of
territory
were
bestowed
upon
mitinti
of
ashdod
and
zillibel
of
graza
as
a
reward
for
their
loyalty
the
sequence
of
events
is
not
very
well
observed
in
the
assyrian
text
and
the
liberation
of
padî
is
inserted
in
before
the
account
of
the
war
with
hezekiah
it
seems
very
unlikely
that
the
king
of
judah
would
have
released
his
prisoner
before
his
treaty
with
sennacherib
the
assyrian
scribe
wishing
to
bring
together
all
the
facts
relating
to
ekron
anticipated
this
event
hebrew
tradition
fixed
the
ransom
at
the
lowest
figure
talents
of
silver
instead
of
the
given
in
the
assyrian
document
kings
xviii
and
authorities
have
tried
to
reconcile
this
divergence
by
speculating
on
the
different
values
represented
by
a
talent
in
different
countries
and
epochs
hezekiah
issued
from
the
struggle
with
his
territory
curtailed
and
his
kingdom
devastated
the
last
obstacle
which
stood
in
the
way
of
the
victorious
advance
fell
with
him
and
sennacherib
could
now
push
forward
with
perfect
safety
towards
the
nile
he
had
indeed
already
planned
an
attack
on
egypt
and
had
reached
the
isthmus
when
a
mysterious
accident
arrested
his
further
progress
the
conflict
on
the
plains
of
altaku
had
been
severe
and
the
army
already
seriously
diminished
by
its
victory
had
been
still
further
weakened
during
the
campaign
in
judæa
and
possibly
the
excesses
indulged
in
by
the
soldiery
had
developed
in
them
the
germs
of
one
of
those
terrible
epidemics
which
had
devastated
western
asia
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
century
whatever
may
have
been
the
cause
half
the
army
was
destroyed
by
pestilence
before
it
reached
the
frontier
of
the
delta
and
sennacherib
led
back
the
shattered
remnants
of
his
force
to
nineveh
the
assyrian
texts
are
silent
about
this
catastrophe
and
the
sacred
books
of
the
hebrews
seem
to
refer
it
to
the
camp
at
libnah
in
palestine
kings
xix
the
egyptian
legend
related
by
herodotus
seems
to
prove
that
it
took
place
near
the
egyptian
frontier
josephus
takes
the
king
as
far
as
pelusium
and
describes
the
destruction
of
the
assyrian
army
as
taking
place
in
the
camp
before
this
town
he
may
have
been
misled
by
the
meaning
which
attaches
to
the
name
of
libnah
as
well
as
to
that
of
pelusium
oppert
upheld
his
opinion
and
identified
the
libnah
of
the
biblical
narrative
with
the
pelusium
of
herodotus
it
is
probable
that
each
of
the
two
nations
referred
the
scene
of
the
miracle
to
a
different
locality
the
hebrews
did
not
hesitate
to
ascribe
the
event
to
the
vengeance
of
jahveh
and
to
make
it
a
subject
of
thankfulness
they
related
that
before
their
brutal
conqueror
quitted
the
country
he
had
sent
a
parting
message
to
hezekiah
not
thy
god
in
whom
thou
trustest
deceive
thee
saying
jerusalem
shall
not
be
given
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
assyria
behold
thou
hast
heard
what
the
kings
of
assyria
have
done
to
all
lands
by
destroying
them
utterly
and
shalt
thou
be
delivered
have
the
gods
of
the
nations
delivered
them
which
my
fathers
have
destroyed
gozan
and
haran
and
rezepk
and
the
children
of
eden
which
were
in
telassar
where
is
the
king
of
hamath
and
the
king
of
arpad
and
the
king
of
the
city
of
sepharvaim
of
hena
and
ivvah
hezekiah
having
received
this
letter
of
defiance
laid
it
in
the
temple
before
jahveh
and
prostrated
himself
in
prayer
the
response
came
to
him
through
the
mouth
of
isaiah
saith
the
lord
concerning
the
king
of
assyria
he
shall
not
come
unto
this
city
nor
shoot
an
arrow
there
neither
shall
he
come
before
it
with
a
shield
nor
cast
a
mount
against
it
by
the
way
that
he
came
by
the
same
shall
he
return
and
he
shall
not
come
unto
this
city
saith
the
lord
for
i
will
defend
this
city
to
save
it
for
mine
own
sake
and
for
my
servant
sake
and
it
came
to
pass
that
night
that
the
angel
of
the
lord
went
forth
and
smote
in
the
camp
of
the
assyrians
an
hundred
and
five
thousand
and
when
men
arose
early
in
the
morning
behold
they
were
all
dead
kings
xix
isa
xxxvii
this
is
the
second
tradition
of
which
mention
has
been
made
but
already
amalgamated
with
the
first
to
form
the
narrative
as
it
now
stands
the
egyptians
considered
the
event
no
less
miraculous
than
did
the
hebrews
and
one
of
their
popular
tales
ascribed
the
prodigy
to
phtah
the
god
of
memphis
sethon
the
high
priest
of
phtah
lived
in
a
time
of
national
distress
and
the
warrior
class
whom
he
had
deprived
of
some
of
its
privileges
refused
to
take
up
arms
in
his
behalf
he
repaired
therefore
to
the
temple
to
implore
divine
assistance
and
falling
asleep
was
visited
by
a
dream
the
god
appeared
to
him
and
promised
to
send
him
some
auxiliaries
who
should
ensure
him
success
he
enlisted
such
of
the
egyptians
as
were
willing
to
follow
him
shopkeepers
fullers
and
sutlers
and
led
them
to
pelusium
to
resist
the
threatened
invasion
in
the
night
a
legion
of
came
forth
whence
no
one
knew
and
noiselessly
spreading
throughout
the
camp
of
the
assyrians
gnawed
the
quivers
the
bowstrings
and
the
straps
of
the
bucklers
in
such
a
way
that
on
the
morrow
the
enemy
finding
themselves
disarmed
fled
after
a
mere
pretence
at
resistance
and
suffered
severe
losses
a
statue
was
long
shown
in
the
temple
at
memphis
portraying
this
sethon
he
was
represented
holding
a
mouse
in
his
hand
and
the
inscription
bade
men
reverence
the
god
who
had
wrought
this
miracle
the
statue
with
which
this
legend
has
been
connected
must
have
represented
a
king
offering
the
image
of
a
mouse
crouching
on
a
basket
like
the
cynocephalus
on
the
hieroglyphic
sign
which
denotes
centuries
or
the
frog
of
the
goddess
hiqît
historians
have
desired
to
recognise
in
sethon
a
king
zêt
of
the
xxiiith
dynasty
or
even
shabîtoku
of
the
xxvth
dynasty
krall
identified
him
with
satni
in
the
demotic
story
of
the
disaster
was
a
terrible
one
triumphant
advance
was
suddenly
checked
and
he
was
forced
to
return
to
asia
when
the
goal
of
his
ambition
was
almost
reached
the
loss
of
a
single
army
however
much
to
be
deplored
was
not
irreparable
since
assyria
could
furnish
her
sovereign
with
a
second
force
as
numerous
as
that
which
lay
buried
in
the
desert
on
the
road
to
egypt
but
it
was
uncertain
what
effect
the
news
of
the
calamity
and
the
sight
of
the
survivors
might
have
on
the
minds
of
his
subjects
and
rivals
the
latter
took
no
immediate
action
and
the
secret
joy
which
they
must
have
experienced
did
not
blind
them
to
the
real
facts
of
the
case
for
though
the
power
of
assyria
was
shaken
she
was
still
stronger
than
any
one
of
them
severally
or
even
than
all
of
them
together
and
to
attack
her
or
rebel
against
her
now
was
to
court
defeat
with
as
much
certainty
as
in
past
days
the
pharaoh
kept
himself
behind
his
rivers
the
military
science
and
skill
which
had
baffled
his
generals
on
the
field
of
altaku
did
not
inspire
him
with
any
desire
to
reappear
on
the
plains
of
palestine
hezekiah
king
of
judah
had
emptied
his
treasury
to
furnish
his
ransom
his
strongholds
had
capitulated
one
by
one
and
his
territory
diminished
by
the
loss
of
some
of
the
towns
of
the
shephelah
was
little
botter
than
a
waste
of
smoking
ruins
he
thought
himself
fortunate
to
have
preserved
his
power
under
the
suzerainty
of
assyria
and
his
sole
aim
for
many
years
was
to
refill
his
treasury
reconstitute
his
army
and
his
kingdom
the
philistine
and
nabatasan
princes
and
the
chiefs
of
moab
ammon
and
idumsea
had
nothing
to
gain
by
war
being
too
feeble
to
have
any
chance
of
success
without
the
help
of
judah
tyre
and
egypt
the
syrians
maintained
a
peaceful
attitude
which
was
certainly
their
wisest
policy
and
during
the
following
quarter
of
a
century
they
loyally
obeyed
their
governors
and
gave
sennacherib
no
cause
to
revisit
them
it
was
fortunate
for
him
that
they
did
so
for
the
peoples
of
the
north
and
east
the
kaldâ
and
above
all
the
elamites
were
the
cause
of
much
trouble
and
exclusively
occupied
his
attention
during
several
years
the
inhabitants
of
urged
on
either
by
their
natural
restlessness
or
by
the
news
of
the
misfortune
which
had
befallen
their
enemy
determined
once
more
to
try
the
fortunes
of
war
incited
by
one
of
their
princes
and
by
these
people
of
the
marshes
intrigued
with
the
courts
of
babylon
and
susa
and
were
emboldened
to
turn
against
the
assyrian
garrisons
stationed
in
their
midst
to
preserve
order
vengeance
fell
first
on
who
fled
from
his
stronghold
of
bîttutu
after
sustaining
a
short
siege
deserted
by
his
accomplice
put
the
statues
of
his
gods
and
his
royal
treasures
on
board
his
fleet
and
embarking
with
his
followers
crossed
the
lagoon
and
effected
a
landing
in
the
district
of
nagîtu
in
susian
territory
beyond
the
mouth
of
the
ulaî
sennacherib
entered
without
striking
a
blow
and
completed
the
destruction
of
the
town
he
next
proceeded
to
demolish
the
other
cities
one
after
the
other
carrying
off
into
captivity
all
the
men
and
cattle
who
fell
in
his
way
three
kings
of
babylon
at
this
period
bore
very
similar
names
and
is
the
elder
of
the
two
whom
the
texts
call
shuzub
and
whom
assyriologists
at
first
confused
one
with
another
nagîtu
was
bounded
by
the
and
the
ulaî
which
allows
us
to
identify
it
with
the
territory
south
of
edrisieh
the
elamites
disconcerted
by
the
rapidity
of
his
action
allowed
him
to
crush
their
allies
unopposed
and
as
they
had
not
openly
intervened
the
conqueror
refrained
from
calling
them
to
account
for
their
intrigues
babylon
paid
the
penalty
for
all
its
sovereign
belibni
who
had
failed
to
make
the
sacred
authority
of
the
suzerain
respected
in
the
city
and
who
perhaps
had
taken
some
part
in
the
conspiracy
was
with
his
family
deported
to
nineveh
and
his
vacant
throne
was
given
to
a
younger
son
of
sargon
berosus
misled
by
the
deposition
of
belibni
thought
that
the
expedition
was
directed
against
babylon
itself
he
has
likewise
confounded
with
and
he
has
given
this
latter
whom
he
calls
asordancs
as
the
immediate
successor
of
belibni
the
date
for
these
events
is
indicated
in
babylonian
which
places
them
in
the
third
year
of
belibni
order
was
once
more
restored
in
karduniash
but
sennacherib
felt
that
its
submission
would
be
neither
sincere
nor
permanent
so
long
as
was
hovering
on
its
frontier
possessed
of
an
army
a
fleet
and
a
supply
of
treasure
and
prepared
to
enter
the
lists
as
soon
as
circumstances
seemed
favourable
to
his
cause
sennacherib
resolved
therefore
to
cross
the
head
of
the
persian
gulf
and
deal
him
such
a
blow
as
would
once
for
all
end
the
contest
but
troubles
which
broke
out
on
the
urartian
frontier
as
soon
as
he
returned
forced
him
to
put
off
his
project
the
tribes
of
tumurru
who
had
placed
their
strongholds
like
eyries
among
the
peaks
of
nipur
had
been
making
frequent
descents
on
the
plains
of
the
tigris
which
they
had
ravaged
unchecked
by
any
fear
of
assyrian
power
sennacherib
formed
an
entrenched
camp
at
the
foot
of
their
mountain
retreat
and
there
left
the
greater
part
of
his
army
while
he
set
out
on
an
adventurous
expedition
with
a
picked
body
of
infantry
and
cavalry
over
ravines
and
torrents
up
rough
and
difficult
slopes
they
made
their
way
the
king
himself
being
conveyed
in
a
litter
as
there
were
no
roads
practicable
for
his
royal
chariot
he
even
deigned
to
walk
when
the
hillsides
were
too
steep
for
his
bearers
to
carry
him
he
climbed
like
a
goat
slept
on
the
bare
rocks
drank
putrid
water
from
a
leathern
bottle
and
after
many
hardships
at
length
came
up
with

he
destroyed

of

took
advantage
of
his

in

region
to
fortify
the
two
cities

and

to
defend
his
cilician

the
peoples

minor
the
encounter
of
the
assyrians
with
the
greeks
is
only
known
to
us
from
a
fragment
of
berosus
the
foundation
of
tarsus
is
definitely
attributed
to
sennacherib
in
the
same
passage
that
of
ankhialc
is
referred
to
the
fabulous
sardanapalus
but
most
historians
with
much
probability
attribute
the
foundation
to
sennacherib
this
was
a
necessary
precaution
for
the
whole
of
asia
minor
was
just
then
stirred
by
the
inrush
of
new
nations
which
were
devastating
the
country
and
the
effect
of
these
convulsions
was
beginning
to
be
felt
in
the
country
to
the
south
of
the
central
plain
at
the
foot
of

on

frontiers
of

the
fame
of
the
ancient
hittite
sanctuaries
in
the
upper
basin
of

the
araxes
had
descended
now
and
again
to
measure
their
strength
against
the
advanced
posts
of
assyria
or
urartu
but
had
subsequently
withdrawn
and
disappeared
beyond
the
halys
their
movements
may
at
this
time
have
been
so
aggressive
as
to
arouse
serious
anxiety
in
the
minds
of
the
ninevite
rulers
it
is
certain
that
sennacherib
though
apparently
hindered
by
no
revolt
delayed
the
execution
of
the
projects
he
had
formed
against
for
three
years
and
it
is
possible
his
inaction
may
be
attributed
to
the
fear
of
some
complication
arising
on
his
frontier
he
did
not
carry
out
his
scheme
till
when
all
danger
in
that
quarter
had
passed
away
the
enterprise
was
a
difficult
one
for
nagîtu
and
the
neighbouring
districts
were
dependencies
of
susa
and
could
not
be
reached
by
land
without
a
violation
of
blamite
neutrality
which
would
almost
inevitably
lead
to
a
conflict
was
no
longer
alive
in
the
very
year
in
which
his
rival
had
set
up
as
king
of
karduniash
a
revolution
had
broken
out
in
elam
which
was
in
all
probability
connected
with
the
events
then
taking
place
in
babylon
his
subjects
were
angry
with
him
for
having
failed
to
send
timely
succour
to
his
allies
the
kaldâ
and
for
having
allowed
to
be
destroyed
his
own
brother
khalludush
sided
with
the
malcontents
threw
into
prison
and
proclaimed
himself
king
this
time
the
ninevites
thinking
that
elam
was
certain
to
intervene
sought
how
they
might
finally
overpower
before
this
interference
could
prove
effectual
the
feudal
constitution
of
the
blamite
monarchy
rendered
as
we
know
the
mobilisation
of
the
army
at
the
opening
of
a
war
a
long
and
difficult
task
weeks
might
easily
elapse
before
the
first
and
second
grades
of
feudatory
nobility
could
join
the
royal
troops
and
form
a
combined
army
capable
of
striking
an
important
blow
this
was
a
cause
of
dangerous
inferiority
in
a
conflict
with
the
assyrians
the
chief
part
of
whose
forces
bivouacking
close
to
the
capital
during
the
winter
months
could
leave
their
quarters
and
set
out
on
a
campaign
at
little
more
than
a
notice
the
kings
of
elam
minimised
the
danger
by
keeping
sufficient
troops
under
arms
on
their
northern
and
western
frontiers
to
meet
any
emergency
but
an
attack
by
sea
seemed
to
them
so
unlikely
that
they
had
not
for
a
long
time
past
thought
of
protecting
their
the
ancient
chaldæan
cities
uru
bagash
uruk
and
bridu
had
possessed
fleets
on
the
persian
gulf
but
the
times
were
long
past
when
they
used
to
send
to
procure
stone
and
wood
from
the
countries
of
magan
and
melukhkha
and
the
seas
which
they
had
ruled
were
now
traversed
only
by
merchant
vessels
or
besides
this
the
condition
of
the
estuary
seemed
to
prohibit
all
attack
from
that
side
the
space
between
and
the
long
line
of
dunes
or
which
blocked
the
entrance
to
it
was
not
so
much
a
gulf
as
a
lagoon
of
uncertain
and
shifting
extent

water
flowed
only
in
the
middle

stagnant
near
the
shores
the
whole
expanse
was
irregularly
dotted
over

its
service
was
constantly
altered
by
the
alluvial
soil
brought
down
by
the
tigris
the
euphrates
the
ulaî
and
the
uknu
the
navigation
of
this
lagoon
was
dangerous
for
the
relative
positions
of
the
channels
and
shallows
were
constantly
shifting
and
vessels
of
deep
draught
often
ran
aground
in
passing
from
one
end
of
it
to
the
other
the
condition
i
describe

is
very
similar
to
what
admirals
found
years
later
arrian
has
preserved
for
us
the
account
of
navigation
in
these
waters
and
his
description
shows
such
a
condition
of
the
estuary
that
its
main
outline
must
have
remained
unchanged
for
a
considerable
time
the
only
subsequent
alterations
which
had
taken
place
must
have
been
in
the
internal
configuration
where
the
deposit
of
alluvium
must
have
necessarily
reduced

bring

more
than
a

consumed
in

the
united
cities

chaldæa
being
unable
to
furnish
the
transports
required
to
convey
such
a
large
host
across

it
was

to
construct
a
fleet
and
to
do
so
in
such
a
way
that
the
enemy
should
have
no
suspicion
of
danger
sennacherib
accordingly
set
up
his
dockyards
at
on
the
euphrates
and
at
nineveh
on
the
tigris
and
syrian
shipwrights
built
him
a
fleet
of
vessels
after
two
distinct
types
some
were
galleys
identical
in
build
and
equipment
with
those
which
the
mediterranean
natives
used
for
their
traffic
with
distant
lands
the
others
followed
the
old
babylonian
model
with
stem
and
stern

bows

sometimes
distinguished
by
the
carving
of
a
head

justified
the
name
of
given

a
vessel

this
kind

had
no
masts
but
propelling
power
was
provided
by
two
banks
of
oars
one
above
the
other
as
in
the
galleys
the
two
divisions
of
the
fleet
were
ready
at
the
beginning
of
and
it
was
arranged
that
they
should
meet
at
to
the
south
of

fleet

to
descend

that
from

had
to
make
a
more
complicated
journey
the
story
of
the
preparations
as
it
has
been
transmitted
to
us
in
inscriptions
is
curiously
similar
to
the
accounts
given
by
the
greek
historians
of
the
vessels
alexander
had
built
at
babylon
and
by
phoenician
workmen
which
descended
the
euphrates
to
join
the
fleet

the
persian

this
fleet
consisted
of
quinquiremos
according
to
aristobulus
who
was
present
at
their
construction
makes
them
all
vessels
with
seven
banks
of
oars
but
he
evidently
confuses
the
galleys
built
at
thapsacus
with
those
which
came
in
sections
from
phoenicia
and
which
alexander
had
put
together
at
babylon
by
following
the
course
of
the
tigris
to
its
mouth
it
would
have
had
to
skirt
the
coast
of
elam
for
a
considerable
distance
and
would
inevitably
have
aroused
the
suspicions
of
khalludush
the
passage
of
such
a
strong
squadron
must
have
revealed
to
him
the
importance
of
the
enterprise
and
put
him
on
his
guard
the
vessels
therefore
stayed
their
course
at
upi
where
they
were
drawn
ashore
and
transported
on
rollers
across
the
narrow
isthmus
which
separates
the
tigris
from
the
arakhtu
canal

which
they
were
then
relaunched
either
the
canal
had
not
been
well
kept
or
else
it
never
had
the
necessary
depth
at
certain
places
but
the
crews
managed
to
overcome
all
obstacles
and
rejoined
their
comrades
in
due
time
sennacherib
was
ready
waiting
for
them
with
all
his
troops
charioteers
and
horsemen
and
with
supplies
of
food
for
the
men
and
of
barley
and
oats
for
the
horses

soon
as
the

contingent
had
arrived

gave
the
signal
for
departure

at
that
time
not

the
season
was
already
well
advanced
when
the
assyrians
set
out
on
this
expedition
and
november
set
in
while
they
were
ravaging
the
plain
but
the
weather
was
still
so
fine
that
sennacherib
determined
to
take
advantage
of
it
to
march
upon
madaktu
hardly
had
he
scaled
the
heights
when
winter
fell
upon
him
with
its
accompaniment
of
cold
and
squally
weather
storms
broke
out
it
rained
and
snowed
incessantly
the
torrents
and
streams
overflowed
their
banks
so
that
hostilities
had
to
be
suspended
and
the
troops
ordered
back
to
nineveh
the
effect
produced
however
by
these
bold
measures
was
in
no
way
diminished
though
had
not
had
the
necessary
time
to
prepare
for
the
contest
he
was
nevertheless
discredited
among
his
subjects
for
failing
to
bring
them
out
of
it
with
glory
and
three
months
after
the
retreat
of
the
assyrians
he
was
assassinated
in
a
riot

the
of

assyrian

death
of

than
three

his
younger
brother
assumed
the
crown
and
though
his
enemies
disdainfully
refused
to
credit
him
with
either
prudence
or
judgment
he
soon
restored
his
kingdom
to
such
a
formidable
degree
of
power
that
thought
the
opportunity
a
favourable
one
for
striking
a
blow
at
assyria
from
which
she
could
never

plenty

nothing
better
than
to
avenge
the
provinces
so
cruelly
harassed
and
the
cities
consumed
in
the
course
of
the
last
campaign
he
summoned
all
his
nobles

this

the
district

separates

fell

after

for

on

as

violent
storm

plunged
in

unhurt
from

it
seems
as
if
fortune
had
at
last
decided
in
favour
of
the
assyrians
and
they
proclaimed
the
fact
loudly
but
their
success
was
not
so
evident
as
to
preclude
their
adversaries
also
claiming
the
victory
with
some
show
of
truth
in
any
case
the
losses
on
both
sides
were
so
considerable
as
to
force
the
two
belligerents
to
suspend
operations
they
returned
each
to
his
capital
and
matters
remained
much
as
they
had
been
before
the
battle
took
place
babylonian
attributes
the
victory
to
the
elamites
and
says
that
the
year
in
which
the
battle
was
fought
was
unknown
the
testimony
of
this
chronicle
is
so
often
marred
by
partiality
that
to
prefer
it
always
to
that
of
the
ninevite
inscriptions
shows
deficiency
of
critical
ability
the
course
of
events
seems
to
me
to
prove
that
the
advantage
remained
with
the
assyrians
though
the
victory
was
not
decisive
the
date
which
necessarily
falls
between
and
has
been
decided
by
general
considerations
as
the
very
year
in
which
the
was
written
years
might
have
elapsed
before
sennacherib
could
have
ventured
to
recommence
hostilities
he
was
not
deluded
by
the
exaggerated
estimate
of
his
victory
in
the
accounts
given
by
his
court
historians
and
he
recognised
the
fact
that
the
issue
of
the
struggle
must
be
uncertain
as
long
as
the
alliance
subsisted
between
elam
and
chaldæa
but
fortune
came
to
his
aid
sooner
than
he
had
expected
was
not
absolute
in
his
dominions
any
more
than
his
predecessors
had
been
and
the
losses
he
had
sustained
at
khalulê
without
obtaining
any
compensating
advantages
in
the
form
of
prisoners
or
spoil
had
lowered
him
in
the
estimation
of
his
vassals
on
the
other
hand
had
emptied
his
treasuries
and
though
karduniash
was
wealthy
it
was
hardly
able
after
such
a
short
interval
to
provide
further
subsidies
to
purchase
the
assistance
of
the
mountain
tribes
emissaries
kept
him
well
informed
of
all
that
occurred
in
the
court
and
he
accordingly
took
the
field
again
at
the
beginning
of
and
on
this
occasion
circumstances
seemed
likely
to
combine
to
give
him
an
easy
victory
the
assyrian
documents
insert
the
account
of
the
capture
of
babylon
directly
after
the
battle
of
khalulê
and
modern
historians
therefore
concluded
that
the
two
events
took
place
within
a
few
months
of
each
other
the
information
afforded
by
babylonian
has
enabled
us
to
correct
this
mistake
and
to
bring
down
the
date
of
the
taking
of
babylon
to
shut
himself
up
in
babylon
not
doubting
that
the
elamites
would
hasten
to
his
succour
as
soon
as
they
should
hear
of
his
distress
but
his
expectation
was
not
fulfilled
was
struck
down
by
apoplexy
on
the
of
nisân
and
though
his
illness
did
not
at
once
terminate
fatally
he
was
left
paralysed
with
distorted
mouth
and
loss
of
speech
incapable
of
action
and
almost
unfit
to
govern
his
seizure
put
a
stop
to
his
warlike
preparations
and
his
ministers
preoccupied
with
the
urgent
question
of
the
succession
to
the
throne
had
no
desire
to
provoke
a
conflict
with
assyria
the
issue
of
which
could
not
be
foretold
they
therefore
left
their
ally
to
defend
his
own
interests
as
best
he
might
babylon
reduced
to
rely
entirely
on
its
own
resources
does
not
seem
to
have
held
out
long
and
perhaps
the
remembrance
of
the
treatment
it
had
received
on
former
occasions
may
account
for
the
very
slight
resistance
it
now
offered
the
assyrian
kings
who
had
from
time
to
time
conquered
babylon
had
always
treated
it
with
great
consideration
they
had
looked
upon
it
as
a
sacred
city
whose
caprices
and
outbreaks
must
always
be
pardoned
it
was
only
with
infinite
precautions
that
they
had
imposed
their
commands
upon
it
and
even
when
they
had
felt
that
severity
was
desirable
they
had
restrained
themselves
in
using
it
and
humoured
the
idiosyncrasies
of
the
inhabitants
iii
shalmaneser
and
sargon
had
all
preferred
to
be
legally
crowned
as
sovereigns
of
babylon
instead
of
remaining
merely
its
masters
by
right
of
conquest
and
though
sennacherib
had
refused
compliance
with
the
traditions
by
which
his
predecessors
had
submitted
to
be
bound
he
had
behaved
with
unwonted
lenity
after
quelling
the
two
previous
revolts
he
now
recognised
that
his
clemency
had
been
shown
in
vain
and
his
small
stock
of
patience
was
completely
exhausted
just
when
fate
threw
the
rebellious
city
into
his
power
if
the
inhabitants
had
expected
to
be
once
more
let
off
easily
their
illusions
were
speedily
dissipated
they
were
slain
by
the
sword
as
if
they
had
been
ordinary
foes
such
as
jews
tibarenians
or
kaldâ
of
and
they
were
spared
none
of
the
horrors
which
custom
then
permitted
the
stronger
to
inflict
upon
the
weaker

several
days
the
pitiless
massacre

and

fell

avenue

which
led

babylon
as
we
have
said
before
was
too
powerful
to
be
reduced
for
long
to
the
second
rank
in
a
mesopotamian
empire
as
soon
as
fate
established
the
seat
of
empire
in
the
districts
bordering
on
the
euphrates
and
the
middle
course
of
the
tigris
its
situation
its
size
its
riches
the
extent
of
its
population
the
number
of
its
temples
and
the
beauty
of
its
palaces
all
conspired
to
make
it

capital

country

thrust
themselves
into
the
foremost
rank
and
by
a
strenuous
effort
made
their
princes
rulers
of
babylon
in
a
short
time
babylon
replenished
her
treasury
found
allies
soldiers
and
leaders
and
in
spite
of
reverses
of
fortune
soon
regained
the
upper
hand
the
only
treatment
which
could
effectually
destroy
her
ascendency
was
that
of
leaving
in
her
not
one
brick
upon
another
thus
preventing
her
from
being
for
several
generations
since
a
new
city
could
not
at
once
spring
up
from
the
ashes
of
the
old
until
she
had
been
utterly
destroyed
her
conquerors
had
still
reason
to
fear
her
this
fact
sennacherib
or
his
councillors
knew
well
if
he
merits
any
reproach
it
is
not
for
having
seized
the
opportunity
of
destroying
the
city
which
babylon
offered
him
but
rather
for
not
having
persevered
in
his
design
to
the
end
and
reduced
her
to
a
mere
name
in
the
midst
of
these
costly
and
absorbing
wars
we
may
well
wonder
how
sennacherib
found
time
and
means
to
build
villas
or
temples
yet
he
is
nevertheless
among
the
kings
of
assyria
the
monarch
who
has
left
us
the
largest
number
of
monuments
he
restored
a
shrine
of
nergal
in
the
small
town
of
tarbizi
he
fortified
the
village
of
alshi
and
in
he
founded
a
royal
residence
in
the
fortress
of
kakzi
which
defended
the
approach
to
calah
from
the
he
did
not
reside
much
at
neither
did
he
complete
the
decoration
of
his
palace
there
his
pride
as
a
victorious
warrior
suffered
when
his
surroundings
reminded
him
of
a
more
successful
conqueror
than
himself
and
calah
itself
was
too
full
of
memories
of
iii
and
the
sovereigns
of
the
eighth
century
for
him
to
desire
to
establish
his
court
there
he
preferred
to
reside
at
nineveh
which
had
been
much
neglected
by
his
predecessors
and
where
the
crumbling
edifices

selected
this

as

residence
at
the
very
beginning
of
his
reign
perhaps
while
he
was
still

and
began
by
repairing
its
ancient
fortifications
later
on

the
success
of

campaigns
had
furnished

with

talent

of

developed
what
immediately
strikes
the

the
great
skill
with
which
his

covered
the

overcrowding

no

treated
their

whether
it
were
a
warlike
expedition
a

an

themselves

ask

the
precision
with
which
the
details

rendered
whether
the

not
drawn

glean
from

some

find
that

we
have
pointed

of

which
brought
them
nothing
but
loss
of
men
and
treasure
but
behind
these
states
on
the
distant
horizon
to
the
east
and
were
rising
up
new
nations
whose
growth
and
erratic
movements
assumed
an
importance
that
became
daily
more
and
more
alarming
on
the
east
the
medes
till
lately
undistinguishable
from
the
other
tribes
occupying
the
western
corner
of
the
iranian
had
recently
broken
away
from
the
main
body
and
rallying
round
a
single
leader
already
gave
promise
of
establishing
an
empire
formidable
alike
by
the
energy
of
its
people
and
the
extent
of
its
domain
a
tradition
afterwards
accepted
by
them
attributed
their
earlier
successes
to
a
certain
deïokes
son
of
phraortes
a
man
wiser
than
his
fellows
who
first
set
himself
to
deal
out
justice
in
his
own
household
the
men
of
his
village
observing
his
merits
chose
him
to
be
the
arbiter
of
all
their
disputes
and
being
secretly
ambitious
of
sovereign
power
he
did
his
best
to
settle
their
differences
on
lines
of
the
strictest
equity
and
justice
by
these
means
he
gained
such
credit
with
his
as
to
attract
the
attention
of
those
who
lived
in
the
neighbouring
villages
who
had
suffered
from
unjust
judgments
so
that
when
they
heard
of
the
singular
uprightness
of
deïokes
and
of
the
equity
of
his
decisions
they
joyfully
had
recourse
to
him
until
at
last
they
came
to
put
confidence
in
no
one
else
the
number
of
complaints
brought
before
him
continually
increasing
as
people
learnt
more
and
more
the
justice
of
his
judgments
deïokes
finding
himself
now
announced
that
he
did
not
intend
any
longer
to
hear
causes
and
appeared
no
more
in
the
seat
in
which
he
had
been
accustomed
to
sit
and
administer
justice
was
not
to
his
advantage
he
said
spend
the
whole
day
in
regulating
other
affairs
to
the
neglect
of
his
hereupon
robbery
and
lawlessness
broke
out
afresh
and
prevailed
throughout
the
country
even
more
than
heretofore
wherefore
the
medes
assembled
from
all
quarters
and
held
a
consultation
on
the
state
of
affairs
the
speakers
as
i
think
were
chiefly
friends
of
deïokes
can
not
possibly
they
said
on
living
in
this
country
if
things
continue
as
they
now
are
let
us
therefore
set
a
king
over
us
so
that
the
land
may
be
well
governed
and
we
ourselves
may
be
able
to
attend
to
our
own
affairs
and
not
be
forced
to
quit
our
country
on
account
of
after
speaking
thus
they
persuaded
themselves
that
they
desired
a
king
and
forthwith
debated
whom
they
should
choose
deïokes
was
proposed
and
warmly
praised
by
all
so
they
agreed
to
elect
whereupon
deïokes
had
a
great
palace
built
and
enrolled
a
bodyguard
to
attend
upon
him
he
next
called
upon
his
subjects
to
leave
their
villages
and
medes
obedient
to
his
orders
built
the
city
now
called
ecbatana
the
walls
of
which
are
of
great
size
and
strength
rising
in
circles
one
within
the
other
the
walls
are
concentric
and
so
arranged
that
they
rise
one
above
the
other
by
the
height
of
their
battlements
the
nature
of
the
ground
which
is
a
gentle
hill
favoured
this
arrangement
the
number
of
the
circles
is
seven
the
royal
palace
and
the
treasuries
standing
within
the
last
the
circuit
of
the
outer
wall
is
very
nearly
the
same
as
that
of
athens
of
this
wall
the
battlements
are
white
of
the
next
black
of
the
third
scarlet
of
the
fourth
blue
of
the
fifth
orange
the
two
last
have
their
battlements
coated
respectively
with
silver
and
gold
all
these
fortifications
deïokes
caused
to
be
raised
for
himself
and
his
own
palace
the
people
he
required
to
dwell
outside
the
citadel
when
the
town
was
finished
he
established
a
rule
that
no
one
should
have
direct
access
to
the
king
but
that
all
communications
should
pass
through
the
hands
of
messengers
it
was
declared
to
be
unseemly
for
any
one
to
see
the
king
face
to
face
or
to
laugh
or
spit
in
his
presence
this
ceremonial
deïokes
established
for
his
own
security
fearing
lest
his
compeers
who
had
been
brought
up
with
him
and
were
of
as
good
family
and
parts
as
he
should
be
vexed
at
the
sight
of
him
and
conspire
against
him
he
thought
that
by
rendering
himself
invisible
to
his
vassals
they
would
in
time
come
to
regard
him
as
quite
a
different
sort
of
being
from
two
or
three
facts
stand
out
from
this
legendary
background
it
is
probable
that
deïokes
was
an
actual
person
that
the
empire
of
the
medes
first
took
shape
under
his
auspices
that
he
formed
an
important
kingdom
at
the
foot
of
mount
elvend
and
founded
ecbatana
the
great
or
at
at
any
rate
helped
to
raise
it
to
the
rank
of
a
capital
the
existence
of
deïokes
has
been
called
in
question
by
grote
and
by
the
rawlinsons
most
recent
historians
however
accept
the
story
of
this
personage
as
true
in
its
main
facts
some
believe
him
to
have
been
merely
the
ancestor
of
the
royal
house
which
later
on
founded
the
united
kingdom
of
the
medes
its
site
was
happily
chosen
in
a
rich
and
fertile
valley
close
to
where
the
roads
emerge
which
cross
the
zagros
chain
of
mountains
and
connect
iran
with
the
valleys
of
the
tigris
and
euphrates
almost
on
the
border
of
the
salt
desert
which
forms
and
renders
sterile
the
central
regions
of
the
plateau
mount
elvend

it
and

the

deïokes
with
a
reign

years
which
occupied
almost
the
whole
of
the
first
half
of
the
seventh
century
from
to
or
from
to
herodotus
expressly
attributes
a
reign
of
years
to
his
deïokes
and
the
total
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
which
we
obtain
by
adding
together
the
number
of
years
assigned
by
him
to
the
four
median
kings
brings
us
back
to
if
we
admit
as
he
does
that
the
year
of
the
proclamation
by
cyrus
as
king
of
persia
was
that
in
which
astyages
was
overthrown
we
get
as
the
date
of
accession
if
we
separate
the
two
facts
as
the
monuments
compel
us
to
do
and
reckon
the
hundred
and
fifty
years
of
the
median
empire
from
the
fall
of
astyages
in
the
records
of
nineveh
mention
a
certain
dayaukku
who
was
governor
of
the
mannai
and
an
ally
of
the
assyrians
in
the
days
of
sargon
and
was
afterwards
deported
with
his
family
to
hamath
in
two
years
later
reference
is
made
to
an
expedition
across
the
territory
of
which
is
described
as
lying
between
ellipi
and
karalla
thus
corresponding
to
the
modern
province
of
hamadân
it
is
quite
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
the
dayaukku
who
gave
his
name
to
this
district
was
identical
with
the
deiokes
of
later
writers
the
form
deïokes
in
place
of
daïokes
is
due
to
the
ionic
dialect
employed
by
herodotus
justi
regards
the
name
as
an
abbreviated
form
of
the
ancient
persian
master
of
a
province
with
the
suffix
illustration
view
of
hamadân
and
mount
elvend
in
winter
drawn
by
boudier
from
a
photograph
by
de
morgan
he
was
the
official
ancestor
of
a
royal
house
a
fact
proved
by
the
way
in
which
his
conqueror
uses
the
name
to
distinguish
the
country
over
which
he
had
ruled
moreover
the
epoch
assigned
to
him
by
contemporary
chroniclers
coincides
closely
enough
with
that
indicated
by
tradition
in
the
case
of
deïokes
he
was
never
the
august
sovereign
that
posterity
afterwards
made
him
out
to
be
and
his
territory
included
barely
half
of
what
constituted
the
province
of
media
in
classical
times
he
contrived
however
and
it
was
this
that
gained
him
universal
renown
in
later
days
to
create
a
central
for
the
median
tribes
around
which
they
henceforth
grouped
themselves
the
work
of
concentration
was
merely
in
its
initial
stage
during
the
lifetime
of
sennacherib
and
little
or
nothing
was
felt
of
its
effects
outside
its
immediate
area
of
influence
but
the
pacific
character
ascribed
to
the
worthy
deïokes
by
popular
legends
is
to
a
certain
extent
confirmed
by
the
testimony
of
the
monuments
they
record
only
one
expedition
in
against
ellipi
and
the
neighbouring
tribes
in
the
course
of
which
some
portions
of
the
newly
acquired
territory
were
annexed
to
the
province
of
kharkhar
and
after
mentioning
this
the
annals
have
nothing
further
to
relate
during
the
rest
of
the
reign
sennacherib
was
too
much
taken
up
with
his
retaliatory
measures
against
babylon
or
his
disputes
with
blam
to
think
of
venturing
on
expeditions
such
as
those
which
had
brought
iii
or
sargon
within
sight
of
mount
bikni
while
the
medes
on
their
part
had
suffered
so
many
reverses
under
these
two
monarchs
that
they
probably
thought
twice
before
attacking
any
of
the
outposts
scattered
along
the
assyrian
frontier
nothing
occurred
to
disturb
their
tranquillity
during
the
early
years
of
the
seventh
century
and
this
peaceful
interval
probably
enabled
deïokes
to
consolidate
if
not
to
extend
his
growing
authority
but
if
matters
were
quiet
at
all
events
on
the
surface
in
this
direction
the
nations
on
the
north
and
had
for
some
time
past
begun
to
adopt
a
more
threatening
attitude
that
migration
of
races
between
europe
and
asia
which
had
been
in
such
active
progress
about
the
middle
of
the
second
millennium
before
our
era
had
increased
twofold
in
intensity
after
the
rise
of
the
xxth
egyptian
dynasty
and
from
thenceforward
a
wave
of
new
races
had
gradually
spread
over
the
whole
of
asia
minor
and
had
either
driven
the
older
peoples
into
the
less
fertile
or
more
inaccessible
districts
or
else
had
overrun
and
absorbed
them
illustration
asia
minor
in
the
century
many
of
the
nations
that
had
fought
against
ramses
ii
and
ramses
such
as
the
uashasha
the
shagalasha
the
zakkali
the
danauna
and
the
tursha
had
disappeared
but
the
thracians
whose
appearance
on
the
scene
caused
such
consternation
in
days
gone
by
had
taken
root
in
the
very
heart
of
the
peninsula
and
had
in
the
course
of
three
or
four
generations
succeeded
in
establishing
a
thriving
state
the
legend
which
traced
the
descent
of
the
royal
line
back
to
the
fabulous
hero
ascanius
proves
that
at
the
outset
the
haughty
tribe
of
the
ascanians
must
have
taken
precedence
over
their
fellows
it
soon
degenerated
however
and
before
long
the
phrygian
tribe
gained
the
upper
hand
and
gave
its
name
to
the
whole
nation
the
name
of
this
tribe
was
retained
by
a
district
afterwards
included
in
the
province
of
bithynia
viz
ascania
on
the
shores
of
the
ascanian
lake
the
distribution
of
place
and
personal
names
over
the
face
of
the
country
makes
it
seem
extremely
probable
that
ascania
and
the
early
ascanians
occupied
the
whole
of
the
region
bounded
on
the
north
by
the
propontis

clothed
in

we
can
not

which
of
the

handed
down
by
tradition

may
represent
the
religion
of
the
phrygians
is
shrouded
in
the
same
mystery
as
their
civilisation

their

presents
a
curious
mixture
of
european

asianic
elements
the

the
black
earth
which
brings
forth
without

her
central
place

originally
to
have
been
in
the
region
of
the

it
was
there
that
her
sacred
cities
tyana
venasa
and
the
cappadocian
comana
were
to
be
found
as
late
as
roman
times
in
these
towns
her
priests
were
regarded
as
kings
and
thousands
of
her
priestesses
spent
lives
of
prostitution
in
her
service
but
her
sanctuaries
with
their
special
rites
and
regulations
were
scattered
over
the
whole
peninsula
she
was
sometimes
worshipped
under
the
form
of
a
meteoric
stone
or
betyle
similar
to
those

more
frequently

that
she
compelled
him
to
emasculate
himself
in
a
fit
of
mad
delirium

then
transformed
him
into

asianic

precedence
was
universally
given
to
a
celestial

named
bagaios
lord

because
he
was
worshipped
under

gigantic
sacred
oak
he
was

of

he
doubtless
allowed
a

his
throne
but
sauazios
another
and
at
first
less
venerable
deity
had
thrown
this
august
pair
into
the
shade
the
existence
of
such
a
goddess
may
be
deduced
from
the
passage
in
which

give

many

for
lack

representations
the
greeks
finding
this
sauazios
at
the
head
of
the

pantheon
identified
him
with
their
zeus

less
frequently
with

he
was
really
a

of

he
became
torpid

slept
a
sleep
all
through
the

no

did
he

the

he
again

and
intoxication
guarded
by

sileni
of
greek
mythology
the
resemblances
detected
by
the
between
the
orgies
of

those
of

quickly
led
to
confusion

this

evolved
from
so
many
diverse
elements
possessed
a
character
of
sombre
poetry
and
sensual
fanaticism
which
appealed
strongly
to
the
greek
imagination
they
quickly
adopted

its
most
barbarous
mysteries

celebrated
in

of
the

atys

of
sauazios
they
tell
us
but
little
of
the
inner
significance
of
the
symbols

doctrines
taught
by
its
votaries
but
have
frequently
described
its
outward
manifestations
these
consisted
of
aimless
wanderings
through
the
forests
in
which
the
priest
incarnate

of
his
god
led

him

an
uneventful
existence
beside
them
under
dynasties
which
have
received
merely
passing
notice
at
the
hands
of
the
greek
chroniclers
they
credit
it
at
the
outset
with
the
almost
fabulous
royal
line
of
the
atyadæ
in
one
of
whose
reigns
the
tyrseni
are
said
to
have
migrated
into
italy
towards
the
twelfth
century
the
atyadæ
were
supplanted
by
a
family
of
heraclido
who
traced
their
descent
to
a
certain
agrôn
whose
personality
is
only
a
degree
less
mythical
than
his
ancestry
he
was
descended
from
heracles
through
alcseus
belus
and
ninus
whether
these
last
two
names
point
to
intercourse
with
one
or
other
of
the
courts
on
the
banks
of
the
euphrates
it
is
difficult
to
say
heraclido
each
one
the
son
of
his
predecessor
are
said
to
have
followed
agrôn
on
the
throne
their
combined
reigns
giving
a
total
of
five
hundred
years
most
of
these
princes
whether
atyadæ
or
heraclidæ
have
for
us
not
even
a
shadowy
existence
and
what
we
know
of
the
remainder
is
of
a
purely
fabulous
nature
for
instance
kambles
is
reported
to
have
possessed
such
a
monstrous
appetite
that
he
devoured
his
own
wife
one
night
while
asleep
the
number
is
a
purely
conventional
one
and
gutschmid
has
shown
how
it
originated
the
computation
at
first
comprised
the
complete
series
of
heraclidæ
and
mermnadæ
estimated
reasonably
at
kings
to
a
century
x
years
from
the
taking
of
sardes
to
the
supposed
accession
of
agrôn
as
it
was
known
from
other
sources
that
the
mermnadæ
had
reigned
years
these
were
subtracted
from
the
to
obtain
the
duration
of
the
heraclidæ
alone
and
by
this
means
were
obtained
the
years
mentioned
by
herodotus
another
version
related
by
nicolas
of
damascus
refers
the
story
to
the
time
of
lardanos
a
contemporary
of
hercules
it
shows
that
the
lydian
chronographers
considered
kambles
or
kamblitas
as
being
one
of
the
last
of
the
atyad
kings
the
concubine
of
meles
again
is
said
to
have
brought
forth
a
lion
and
the
oracle
of
telmessos
predicted
that
the
town
of
sardes
would
be
rendered
impregnable
if
the
animal
were
led
round
the
city
walls
this
was
done
except
on
the
side
of
the
citadel
facing
mount
tmolus
which
was
considered
unapproachable
but
it
was
by
that
very
path
that
the
persians
subsequently
entered
the
town
alkimos
we
are
told
accumulated
immense
treasures
and
under
his
rule
his
subjects
enjoyed
unequalled
prosperity
for
fourteen
years
it
is
possible
that
the
story
of
the
expedition
despatched
into
palestine
by
a
certain
akiamos
which
ended
in
the
foundation
of
ascalon
is
merely
a
feeble
echo
of
the
raids
in
syrian
and
egyptian
waters
made
by
the
tyrseni
and
sardinians
in
the
thirteenth
century
the
spread
of
the
phrygians
and
the
subsequent
progress
of
greek
colonisation
must
have
curtailed
the
possessions
of
the
heraclidas
from
the
eleventh
to
the
ninth
centuries
but
the
material
condition
of
the
people
does
not
appear
to
have
suffered
by
this
diminution
of
territory

still
in

circumstances
by

of

assembled
in

this
intervention
of
the
voice
of
the
populace
was
a
thing
unknown
in
the
east
and
had
probably
been
introduced
in
imitation
of
customs
observed
among
the
greeks
of
æolia
or
ionia
it
was
an
important
political
factor
and
might
possibly
lead
to
an
outbreak
or
a
revolution
outside
the
pale
of
sardes
and
the
province
of
mæonia
the
bulk
of
lydian
territory
was
distributed
among
a
very
numerous
body
of
landowners
who
were
particularly
proud
of
their
noble
descent
many
of
these
country
magnates
held
extensive
fiefs
and
had
in
their
pay
small
armies
which
rendered
them
almost
independent
and
the
only
way
for
the
sovereign
to
succeed
in
ruling
them
was
to
conciliate
them
at
all
hazards
and
to
keep
them
in
perpetual
enmity
with
their
fellows
two
of
these
rival
families

secure
the

latter
lay
at

in

of
the

they
had
also
other
possessions

sometimes
of

of
the
occupant
the

of
the
mermnadæ
of
whom
we
get
a

is
daskylos
son
of
gyges
who
about
the
year
was
during
the
declining
years
of
ardys
over
whom
he
exercised
such
influence
that
adyattes
the
heir
to
the
throne
took
umbrage
at
it
and
caused
him
to
be
secretly
assassinated
whereupon
his
widow
fearing
for
her
own
safety
hastily
fled
into
phrygia
of
which
district
she
was
a
native
on
hearing
of
the
crime
ardys
trembling
with
anger
convoked
the
assembly
and
as
his
advanced
age
rendered
walking
difficult
he
caused
himself
to
be
carried
to
the
public
square
in
a
litter
having
reached
the
place
he
laid
the
assassins
under
a
curse
and
gave
permission
to
any
who
could
find
them
to
kill
them
he
then
returned
to
his
palace
where
he
died
a
few
years
later
about
adyattes
took
the
name
of
meles
on
ascending
the
throne
and
at
first
reigned
happily
but
his
curse
weighed
upon
him
and
before
long
began
to
take
effect
lydia
having
been
laid
waste
by
a
famine
the
oracle
declared
that
before
appeasing
the
gods
the
king
must
expiate
the
murder
of
the
mermnad
noble
by
making
every
atonement
in
his
power
if
need
be
by
an
exile
of
three
duration
meles
submitted
to
the
divine
decree
he
sought
out
the
widow
of
his
victim
and
learning
that
during
her
flight
she
had
given
birth
to
a
son
called
like
his
father
daskylos
he
sent
to
entreat
the
young
man
to
repair
immediately
to
sardes
that
he
might
make
amends
for
the
murder
the
youth
however
alleged
that
he
was
as
yet
unborn
at
the
hour
of
his
death
and
therefore
not
entitled
to
be
a
party
to
an
arrangement
which
did
not
personally
affect
him
and
refused
to
return
to
his
own
country
having
failed
in
this
attempt
meles
entrusted
the
regency
of
his
kingdom
to
sadyattes
son
of
kadys
one
of
the
tylonidas
who
probably
had
already
filled
the
post
of
companion
to
the
king
for
some
time
past
and
set
out
for
babylon
when
the
three
years
had
elapsed
sadyattes
faithfully
handed
over
to
him
the
reins
of
government
and
resumed
the
second
place
myrsos
succeeded
meles
about
and
his
accession
immediately
became
the
cause
of
uneasiness
to
the
younger
daskylos
who
felt
that
he
was
no
longer
safe
from
the
intrigues
of
the
heraclidaî
he
therefore
quitted
phrygia
and
settled
beyond
the
italys
among
the
white
syrians
one
of
whom
he
took
in
marriage
and
had
by
her
a
son
whom
he
called
gyges
after
his
ancestor
the
lydian
chronicles
which
have
come
down
to
us
make
no
mention
of
him
after
the
birth
of
this
child
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
we
know
however
from
other
sources
that
the
country
in
which
he
took
refuge
had
for
some
time
past
been
ravaged
by
enemies
coming
from
the
caucasus
known
to
us
as
the
cimmerians
the
lists
of
eusebius
give
years
to
ardys
years
to
meles
or
adyattes
years
to
myrsos
and
years
to
candaules

is
to
say

would
gladly
have

at

the

its

developments

lack

prevents
me
from
doing
more
than

rejected

confused
the
cimmerian
invasion

that
of

that
there
is
reason
to
give
weight

to
distinguish
carefully
between
two

to
me
to
be

do
not

to
place

constituting
a
sort
of
maritime
confederation

heraclea
and
sinôpê
were
the
chief
towns
this
confederation
must
not
be
regarded
as
a
regularly
constituted
state
but
rather
as
a
vast
encampment
in
which
the
warriors
could
leave
their
families
and
their
spoil
in
safety
they
issued
from
it
nearly
every
year
to
spread
themselves
over
the
neighbouring
provinces
sometimes
in
one
direction
sometimes
in
another
the
ancient
sanctuaries
of
pteria
and
the
treasures
they
contained
excited
their
cupidity
but
they
were
not
well
enough
equipped
to
undertake
the
siege
of
a
strongly
fortified
place
and
for
want
of

content
to

difficult
of

which
are
still
used
as
habitations
by
the

it
is
possible
that
they
helped
to
swell
the
marauding
troops
of
the

the
declining
years
of
sennacherib
it
would
appear
that
the
ninevite

an
irresistible
attraction

these
various
peoples
the
fame
of
the
wealth
accumulated
in
the
regions
beyond
the
taurus
and
the
euphrates
in
syria
and
mesopotamia
provoked
their
cupidity
beyond
all
bounds
and
the
time
was
at
hand
when
the
fear
alone
of
the
assyrian
armies
would
no
longer
avail
to
hold
them
in
check
the
last
years
of
sennacherib
had
been
embittered
by
the
intrigues
which
usually
gathered
around
a
monarch
enfeebled
by
age
and
incapable
of
bearing
the
cares
of
government
with
his
former
vigour
a
fierce
rivalry
existed
between
those
of
his
sons
who
aspired
to
the
throne
each
of
whom
possessed
his
following
of
partisans
both
at
court
and
among
the
people
who
were
ready
to
support
him
if
need
be

nominated

successor
and
had
received
the
official
investiture
of
the

kingdom
under
the
name
of
the
eldest
was
perhaps
that
who
reigned
in
babylon
and
who
was
taken
prisoner
to
elam
by
king
khalludush
the
idea
of
an
enthronisation
at
babylon
in
the
lifetime
of
sennacherib
put
forward
by
the
earlier
assyriologists
based
on
an
inscription
on
a
head
discovered
at
babylon
has
been
adopted
and
confirmed
by
winckler
it
was
doubtless
on
this
occasion
that
esarhaddon
received
as
a
present
from
his
father
the
objects
mentioned
in
the
document
which
sayce
and
budge
have
called
without
sufficient
reason

of
the
catastrophe
of
had
not
resulted
in
bringing
about
the
ruin
of
babylon
as
sennacherib
and
his
ministers
had
hoped
the
temples
it
is
true
had
been
desecrated
and
demolished
the
palaces
and
public
buildings
razed
to
the
ground
and
the
ramparts
thrown
down
but
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
city
had
been
set
on
fire
by
the
conquerors
the
quarters
inhabited
by
the
lower
classes
still
remained
standing
and
those
of
the
inhabitants
who
had
escaped
being
carried
away
captive
together
with
such
as
had
taken
refuge
in
the
surrounding
country
or
had
hidden
themselves
in
neighbouring
cities
had
gradually
returned
to
their
desolated
homes
they
cleared
the
streets
repaired
the
damage
inflicted
during
the
siege
and
before
long
the
city
which
was
believed
to
be
hopelessly
destroyed
rose
once
more
with
the
vigour
if
not
with
the
wealth
which
it
had
enjoyed
before
its
downfall
the
mother
of
esarhaddon
was
a
babylonian
by
name
nakïa
and
as
soon
as
her
son
came
into
possession
of
his
inheritance
an
impulse
of
filial
piety
moved
him
to
restore
to
his
city
its
former
rank
of
capital
animated
by
the
strong
religious
feeling
which
formed
the
groundwork
of
his
character
esarhaddon
had
begun
his
reign
by
restoring
the
sanctuaries
which
had
been
the
cradle
of
the
assyrian
religion
and
his
intentions
thus
revealed
at
the
very
outset
had
won
for
him
the
sympathy
of
the
babylonians
this
indeed
was
excited
sooner
than
he
expected
and
perhaps
helped
to
secure
to
him
his
throne
during
his
absence
from
nineveh
a
widespread
plot
had
been
formed
in
that
city
and
on
the
day
of
tebeth
at
the
hour
when
sennacherib
was
praying
before
the
image
of
his
god
two
of
his
sons
sharezer
and
adarmalik
adrammelech
assassinated
their
father
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
a
fragment
seems
to
show
clearly
that
the
restoration
of
the
temples
was
begun
even
in
the
lifetime
of
sennacherib
we
possess
three
different
accounts
of
the
murder
of
sennacherib
in
the
chronicle
of
in
the
bible
kings
xix
cf
isa
xxxvii
chron
xxxii
in
berosus
the
biblical
account
alone
mentions
both
murderers
the
and
berosus
speak
of
only
one
and
their
testimony
seems
to
prevail
with
several
historians
i
believe
that
the
silence
of
the
and
of
berosus
is
explained
by
the
fact
that
sharezer
was
chief
in
the
conspiracy
and
the
one
among
the
sons
who
aspired
to
the
kingdom
the
second
murderer
merely
acted
for
his
brother
and
consequently
had
no
more
right
to
be
mentioned
by
name
than
those
accomplices
not
of
the
who
shared
in
the
murder
the
name
sharezer
is
usually
considered
as
an
abbreviation
of
the
assyrian
name
or
winckler
thinks
that
he
sees
in
it
a
corruption
of
sharitir
abbreviated
from
which
he
finds
as
a
royal
name
on
a
fragment
in
the
british
museum
he
proposes
to
recognise
in
this
sharezer
enthroned
after
his
death
one
half
of
the
army
proclaimed
sharezer
king
the
northern
provinces
espoused
his
cause
and
esarhaddon
must
for
the
moment
have
lost
all
hope
of
the
succession
his
tragic
fate
overwhelmed
him
with
fear
and
grief
he
rent
his
clothes
groaned
and
lamented
like
a
lion
roaring
and
could
be
comforted
only
by
the
oracles
pronounced
by
the
priests
of
babylon
an
assurance
that
the
gods
favoured
his
cause
reached
him
even
from
assyria
and
nineveh
after
a
few
weeks
of
vacillation
acknowledged
him
as
its
sovereign
the
rebellion
being
mercilessly
crushed
on
the
of
adar
the
bible
alone
tells
us
that
sharezer
retired
to
urartu
kings
xix
to
explain
the
plan
of
this
campaign
it
is
usually
supposed
that
at
the
time
of
his
death
esarhaddon
was
either
beyond
mount
taurus
or
else
on
the
armenian
frontier
the
sequence
of
the
dates
in
the
chronicle
of
compels
me
to
revert
to
the
opinion
that
esarhaddon
marched
from
babylon
against
the
rebels
and
pursued
them
as
far
as
mount
taurus
and
beyond
it
to
khanigalbat
although
this
was
a
considerable
advantage
to
cause
it
could
not
be
considered
as
decisive
since
the
provinces
of
the
euphrates
still
declared
for
sharezer
the
gods
therefore
once
more
intervened
ishtar
of
arbela
had
long
been
considered
as
the
recognised
patroness
and
oracle
of
the
dynasty
whether
it
were
a
question
of
a
foreign
expedition
or
a
rebellion
at
home
of
a
threatened
plague
or
invasion
of
a
marriage
or
an
alliance
with
some
powerful
neighbour
the
ruling
sovereign
would
invariably
have
recourse
to
her
always
with
the
same
formula
to
demand
counsel
of
her
for
the
conduct
of
affairs
in
hand
and
the
replies
which
she
vouchsafed
in
various
ways
were
taken
into
consideration
her
will
as
expressed
by
the
mouth
of
her
ministers
would
hasten
suspend
or
modify
the
decisions
of
the
king
esarhaddon
did
not
neglect
to
consult
the
goddess
as
well
as
assur
and
sin
shamash
bel
nebo
and
nergal
and
their
words
transcribed
upon
a
tablet
of
clay
induced
him
to
act
without
further
delay
do
not
hesitate
for
we
march
with
thee
and
we
will
cast
down
thine
enemies
thus
encouraged
he
made
straight
for
the
scene
of
danger
without
passing
through
nineveh
so
as
to
prevent
sharezer
and
his
party
having
time
to
recover
his
biographers
depict
esarhaddon
hurrying
forward
often
a
day
or
more
in
advance
of
his
battalions
without
once
turning
to
see
who
followed
him
and
without
waiting
to
allow
the
horses
of
his
to
be
unharnessed
or
permitting
his
to
pitch
his
tent
he
rested
merely
for
a
few
moments
on
the
bare
ground
indifferent
to
the
cold
and
nocturnal
frosts
of
the
month
of
sebat
it
would
appear
as
if
sharezer
had
placed
his
hopes
on
the
cimmerians
and
had
expected
their
chiefs
to
come
to
the
rescue
this
hypothesis
seems
borne
out
by
the
fact
that
the
decisive
battle
took
place
beyond
the
euphrates
and
the
taurus
in
the
country
of
khanigalbat
esarhaddon
attributed
his
success
to
ishtar
the
goddess
of
bravery
and
of
combat
she
alone
had
broken
the
weapons
of
the
rebels
she
alone
had
brought
confusion
into
their
lines
and
had
inclined
the
hearts
of
the
survivors
to
submit
they
cried
aloud
is
our
king
and
sharezer
thereupon
fled
into
armenia
the
war
had
been
brought
to
a
close
with
such
rapidity
that
even
the
most
unsettled
of
the
assyrian
subjects
and
vassals
had
not
had
time
to
take
advantage
of
it
for
their
own
purposes
the
kaldâ
on
the
persian
gulf
and
the
sidonians
on
the
mediterranean
were
the
only
two
peoples
who
had
openly
revolted
and
were
preparing
to
enter
on
a
struggle
to
preserve
their
independence
thus
once
more
regained
yet
the
events
of
the
preceding
months
had
shaken
the
power
of
nineveh
more
seriously
than
we
should
at
first
suppose
for
the
first
time
since
the
accession
of
iii
the
almost
inevitable
troubles
which
accompany
the
change
of
a
sovereign
had
led
to
an
open
war
the
vast
army
of
sargon
and
sennacherib
had
been
split
up
and
the
two
factions
into
which
it
was
divided
commanded
as
they
were
by
able
generals
and
composed
of
troops
accustomed
to
conquer
must
have
suffered
more
keenly
in
an
engagement
with
each
other
than
in
the
course
of
an
ordinary
campaign
against
a
common
enemy
one
part
at
least
of
the
military
staff
had
become
disorganised
regiments
had
been
decimated
and
considerable
contingents
were
required
to
fill
the
vacancies
in
the
ranks
the
male
population
of
assyria
suddenly
called
on
to
furnish
the
necessary
effective
force
could
not
supply
the
demand
without
drawing
too
great
a
proportion
of
men
from
the
country
and
one
of
those
crises
of
exhaustion
was
imminent
which
come
upon
a
nation
after
an
undue
strain
often
causing
its
downfall
in
the
midst
of
its
success

yielding

easy
prey

been

by
passages
in
the
chronicle
of
esarhaddon
was
personally
inclined
for
peace
and
as
soon
as
he
was
established
on
the
throne
he
gave
orders
that
the
building
works
which
had
been
suspended
during
the
late
troubles
should
be
resumed
and
actively
pushed
forward
but
the
unfortunate
disturbances
of
the
times
did
not
permit
of
his
pursuing
his
favourite
occupation
without
interruption
and
like
those
of
his
warlike
predecessors
his
life
was
passed
almost
entirely
on
the
field
of
battle
babylon
grateful
for
what
he
had
done
for
her
tendered
him
an
unbroken
fidelity
throughout
the
stormy
episodes
of
his
reign
and
showed
her
devotion
to
him
by
an
unwavering
obedience
the
kaldâ
received
no
support
from
that
quarter
and
were
obliged
to
bear
the
whole
burden
of
the
war
which
they
had
provoked
their
chief
who
had
been
placed
over
them
by
sennacherib
now
harassed
the
cities
of
karduniash
and
the
prefect
of
uru
demanded
immediate
help
from
assyria
esarhaddon
at
once
despatched
such
a
considerable
force
that
the
kaldu
chief
did
not
venture
to
meet
it
in
the
open
field
and
after
a
few
unimportant
skirmishes
he
gave
up
the
struggle
and
took
refuge
in
elam
had
died
there
in
a
few
months
before
the
murder
of
sennacherib
and
his
son
a
second
had
succeeded
him
this
prince
appears
either
to
have
shared
the
peaceful
tastes
of
his
of
assyria
or
more
probably
did
not
feel
himself
sufficiently
secure
of
his
throne
to
risk
the
chance
of
coming
into
collision
with
his
neighbour
he
caused
to
be
slain
and
the
other
son
of
who
had
shared
his
flight
was
so
terrified
at
his
murder
that
he
at
once
sought
refuge
in
nineveh
he
was
reinstated
in
his
paternal
domain
on
condition
of
paying
a
tribute
and
faithful
to
his
oath
of
allegiance
he
thenceforward
came
yearly
in
person
to
bring
his
dues
and
pay
homage
to
his
sovereign
the
kaldâ
rising
had
in
short
been
little
more
than
a
skirmish
and
the
chastisement
of
the
sidonians
would
have
involved
neither
time
nor
trouble
had
not
the
desultory
movements
of
the
barbarians
obliged
the
assyrians
to
concentrate
their
troops
on
several
points
which
were
threatened
on
their
northern
frontier
the
cimmerians
and
the
scythians
had
not
suffered
themselves
to
be
disconcerted
by
the
rapidity
with
which
the
fate
of
sharezer
had
been
decided
and
after
a
hesitation
they
had
again
set
out
in
various
directions
on
their
work
of
conquest
believing
no
doubt
that
they
would
meet
with
a
less
vigorous
resistance
after
so
serious
an
upheaval
at
nineveh
the
cimmerians
appear
to
have
been
the
first
to
have
provoked
hostilities
their
king
tiushpa
who
ruled
over
their
territory
on
the
black
sea
ejected
the
assyrian
garrisons
placed
on
the
cappadocian
frontier
and
his
presence
in
that
quarter
aroused
all
the
insubordinate
elements
still
remaining
in
the
cilician
valleys
esarhaddon
brought
him
to
a
stand
on
the
confines
of
the
plain
of
saros
defeated
him
in
khubushna
and
drove
the
remains
of
the
horde
back
across
the
halys
several
assyriologists
have
thought
that
khubushna
might
be
an
error
for
khubushkhia
and
have
sought
the
seat
of
war
on
the
eastern
frontier
of
assyria
in
reality
the
context
shows
that
the
place
under
discussion
is
a
district
in
asia
minor
identified
with
kamisene
by
gelzcr
but
left
unidentified
by
most
authorities
jensen
has
shown
that
the
name
is
mot
with
as
early
as
the
inscriptions
of
pileser
where
we
should
read
khubishna
and
he
places
the
country
in
northern
syria
or
perhaps
further
north
in
the
western
part
of
taurus
the
determinative
proves
that
there
was
a
town
of
this
name
as
well
as
a
district
and
this
consideration
encourages
mo
to
recognise
in
khubushna
or
khubishna
the
town
of
the
sis
of
the
kingdom
of
lesser
armenia
having
thus
averted
the
cimmerian
danger
he
was
able
without
much
difficulty
to
bring
the
rebels
of
the
western
provinces
into
subjection
his
troops
thrust
back
the
cilicians
and
duha
into
the
rugged
fastnesses
of
the
taurus
and
razed
to
the
ground
one
and
twenty
of
their
strongholds
besides
burning
numberless
villages
and
carrying
the
inhabitants
away
captive
these
expeditions
are
not
dated
in
any
of
the
documents
that
deal
with
them
the
fact
that
they
are
mentioned
along
with
the
war
against
tiushpa
and
sidon
makes
me
inclined
to
consider
them
as
being
a
result
of
the
cimmerian
invasion
they
were
strictly
speaking
the
quelling
of
revolts
caused
by
the
presence
of
the
cimmerians
in
that
part
of
the
empire
the
duua
or
duha
of
this
campaign
who
are
designated
as
neighbours
of
the
tabal
lived
in
the
the
name
of
the
town
tyana
is
possibly
composed
of
their
name
and
of
the
suffix
which
is
met
with
in
asianio
languages
the
people
of
parnaki
in
the
bend
of
the
euphrates
between
and
the
sources
of
the
balîkh
had
taken
up
arms
on
hearing
of
the
brief
successes
of
tiushpa
but
were
pitilessly
crushed
by
esarhaddon
the
sheikh
of
arzani
in
the
extreme
south
of
syria
close
to
the
brook
of
egypt
had
made
depredations
on
the
assyrian
frontier
but
he
was
seized
by
the
nearest
governor
and
sent
in
chains
to
nineveh
a
cage
was
built
for
him
at
the
gate
of
the
city
and
he
was
exposed
in
it
to
the
jeers
of
the
populace
in
company
with
the
bears
dogs
and
boars
which
the
ninevites
were
in
the
habit
of
keeping
confined
there
it
would
appear
that
esarhaddon
set
himself
to
come
to
a
final
reckoning
with
sidon
and
phoenicia
the
revolt
of
which
had
irritated
him
all
the
more
in
that
it
showed
an
inexcusable
ingratitude
towards
his
family
for
it
was
sennacherib
who
in
order
to
break
the
power
of
blulai
had
not
only
rescued
sidon
from
the
dominion
of
tyre
but
had
enriched
it
with
the
spoils
taken
from
its
former
rulers
and
had
raised
it
to
the
first
rank
among
the
phoenician
cities
ethbaal
in
his
lifetime
had
never
been
wanting
in
gratitude
but
his
successor
abdimilkôt
forgetful
of
recent
services
had
chafed
at
the
burden
of
a
foreign
yoke
and
had
recklessly
thrown
it
off
as
soon
as
an
occasion
presented
itself
he
had
thought
to
strengthen
himself
by
securing
the
help
of
a
certain
sanduarri
who
possessed
the
two
fortresses
of
kundu
and
sîzu
in
the
cilician
mountains
but
neither
this
alliance
nor
the
insular
position
of
his
capital
was
able
to
safeguard
him
when
once
the
necessity
for
stemming
the
tide
of
the
cimmerian
influx
was
over
and
the
whole
of
the
assyrian
force
was
free
to
be
brought
against
him
some
assyriologists
have
proposed
to
locate
these
two
towns
in
cilicia
others
place
them
in
the
lebanon
kundi
being
identified
with
the
modern
village
of
the
name
of
kundu
so
nearly
recalls
that
of
kuinda
the
ancient
fort
mentioned
by
strabo
to
the
north
of
anchialê
between
tarsus
and
anazarbus
that
i
do
not
hesitate
to
identify
them
and
to
place
kundu
in
cilicia
abdimilkôt
attempted
to
escape
by
sea
before
the
last
attack
but
he
was
certainly
taken
prisoner
though
the
circumstances
are
unrecorded
and
sanduarri
fell
into
the
hands
a
short
time
after
the
suppression
of
the
rebellion
was
as
vindictive
as
the
ingratitude
which
prompted
it
was
heinous
sidon
was
given
up
to
the
soldiery
and
then
burnt
while
opposite
to
the
ruins
of
the
island
city
the
assyrians
built
a
fortress
on
the
mainland
which
they
called
the
other
princes
of
phoenicia
and
syria
were
hastily
convoked
and
were
witnesses
of
the
vengeance
wreaked
on
the
city
as
well
as
of
the
installation
of
the
governor
to
whom
the
new
province
was
entrusted
they
could
thus
see
what
fate
awaited
them
in
the
event
of
their
showing
any
disposition
to
rebel
and
the
majority
of
them
were
not
slow
to
profit
by
the
lesson
the
spoil
was
carried
back
in
triumph
to
nineveh
and
comprised
besides
the
two
kings
and
their
families
the
remains
of
their
court
and
people
and
the
countless
riches
which
the
commerce
of
the
world
had
brought
into
the
great
ports
of
the
mediterranean
ebony
ivory
gold
and
silver
purple
precious
woods
household
furniture
and
objects
of
value
from
all
parts
in
such
quantities
that
it
was
long
before
the
treasury
at
nineveh
needed
any
replenishing
the
reverses
of
the
cimmerians
did
not
serve
as
a
warning
to
the
scythians
settled
on
the
borders
of
manna
partly
no
doubt
on
the
territory
formerly
dependent
on
that
state
they
secretly
incited
the
inhabitants
to
revolt
and
to
join
in
the
raids
which
they
made
on
the
valley
of
the
upper
zab
and
they
would
even
have
urged
their
horses
up
to
the
very
walls
of
nineveh
had
the
occasion
presented
itself
the
importance
of
the
event
and
the
amount
of
the
spoil
captured
are
apparent
if
we
notice
that
esarhaddon
does
not
usually
record
the
booty
taken
after
each
campaign
he
does
so
only
when
the
number
of
objects
and
of
prisoners
taken
from
the
enemy
is
extraordinary
the
chronicle
of
places
the
capture
of
sidon
in
the
second
and
the
death
of
abdimilkôt
in
the
fifth
year
of
his
reign
hence
winckler
has
concluded
that
abdimilkôt
held
out
for
fully
two
years
after
the
loss
of
sidon
the
general
tenor
of
the
account
as
given
by
the
inscriptions
seems
to
me
to
be
that
the
capture
of
the
king
followed
closely
on
the
fall
of
the
town
abdimilkôt
and
sanduarri
probably
spent
the
years
between
and
in
prison
one
of
the
oracles
of
shamash
speaks
of
the
captives
as
dwelling
in
a
canton
of
the
mannai
esarhaddon
warned
of
their
intrigues
by
the
spies
which
he
sent
among
them
could
not
bring
himself
either
to
anticipate
their
attack
or
to
assume
the
offensive
but
anxiously
consulted
the
gods
with
regard
to
them
shamash
he
wrote
to
the
lord
thou
whom
i
question
answer
me
in
sincerity
from
this
day
forth
the
day
of
this
month
of
simanu
until
the
day
of
the
month
of
duzu
of
this
year
during
these
thirty
days
and
thirty
nights
a
time
has
been
foreordained
favourable
to
the
work
of
prophecy
in
this
time
thus
foreordained
the
hordes
of
the
scythians
who
inhabit
a
district
of
the
mannai
and
who
have
crossed
the
mannian
frontier
will
they
succeed
in
their
undertaking
will
they
emerge
from
the
passes
of
khubushkia
at
the
towns
of
kharrânia
and
anîsuskia
will
they
ravage
the
borders
of
assyria
and
steal
great
booty
immense
spoil
that
doth
thy
high
divinity
know
is
it
a
decree
and
in
the
mouth
of
thy

o
shamash
great

and
promulgated

who

see
it
he
who

he
hear

the
town
of
anîsuskia
is
not
mentioned
elsewhere
but
kharrânia
is
met
with
in
the
account
of
the
campaign
of
shalmaneser
iii
with
kharrâna
as
its
variant
the
god
comforted
his
faithful
servant
but
there
was
a
brief
delay
before
his
answer
threw
light
on
the
future
and
the
questions
were
constantly
renewed
as
fresh
couriers
brought
in
further
information
in
the
scythians
determined
to
try
their
fortune
and
their
king
ishpakai
took
the
field
followed
by
the
mannai
he
was
defeated
and
driven
back
to
the
north
of
lake
urumiah
the
mannai
were
reduced
to
subjection
and
assyria
once
more
breathed
freely
the
victory
however
was
not
a
final
one
and
affairs
soon
assumed
as
threatening
an
aspect
as
before
the
scythian
tribes
came
on
the
scene
one
after
another
and
allied
themselves
to
the
various
peoples
subject
either
directly
or
indirectly
to
nineveh
on
one
occasion
it
was
kashtariti
the
regent
of
karkashshi
who
wrote
to
mamitiarshu
one
of
the
median
princes
to
induce
him
to
make
common
cause
with
himself
in
attacking
the
fortress
of
kishshashshu
on
the
eastern
border
of
the
empire
at
another
time
we
find
the
same
chief
plotting
with
the
mannai
and
the
saparda
to
raid
the
town
of
kilmân
and
esarhaddon
implores
the
god
to
show
him
how
the
place
may
be
saved
from
their
machinations
this
name
seems
to
be
of
iranian
origin
justi
has
connected
it
with
the
name
aspakos
which
is
read
in
a
greek
inscription
of
the
cimmerian
bosphorus
both
forms
have
been
connected
with
the
sanskrit
açvalca
this
subdivision
of
the
horde
into
several
bodies
seems
to
be
indicated
by
the
number
of
different
royal
names
among
the
scythians
which
are
mentioned
in
the
assyrian
documents
the
site
of
karkashshi
is
unknown
but
the
list
of
median
princes
subdued
by
sargon
shows
that
it
was
situated
in
media
kishshashshu
is
very
probably
the
same
as
kishisim
or
kishisu
the
town
which
sargon
subdued
and
which
he
called
or
and
which
is
mentioned
in
the
neighbourhood
of
parsuash
karalla
kharkhar
media
and
ellipi
i
think
that
it
would
be
in
the
basin
of
the
gave
rud
billerbeck
places
it
at
the
ruins
of
siama
in
the
upper
valley
of
the
lesser
zab
the
people
of
saparda
called
by
the
persians
sparda
have
been
with
good
reason
identified
with
the
sepharad
of
the
prophet
obadiah
ver
the
assyrian
texts
show
that
this
country
should
be
placed
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
mannai
of
the
medes
he
opens
negotiations
in
order
to
gain
time
but
the
barbarity
of
his
adversary
is
such
that
he
fears
for
his
safety
and
speculates
whether
he
may
not
have
been
put
to
death
the
situation
would
indeed
have
become
critical
if
kashtariti
had
succeeded
in
bringing
against
assyria
a
combined
force
of
medes
scythians
mannai
and
cimmerians
together
with
urartu
and
its
king
eusas
iii
but
fortunately
petty
hatreds
made
the
combination
of
these
various
elements
an
impossibility
and
they
were
unable
to
arrive
at
even
a
temporary
understanding
the
scythians
themselves
were
not
united
as
to
the
best
course
to
be
pursued
and
while
some
endeavoured
to
show
their
hostility
by
every
imaginable
outrage
and
annoyance
others
on
the
contrary
desired
to
enter
into
friendly
relations
with
assyria
esarhaddon
received
on
one
occasion
an
embassy
from
bartatua
one
of
their
kings
who
humbly
begged
the
hand
of
a
lady
of
the
swearing
to
make
a
lasting
friendship
with
him
if
esarhaddon
would
consent
to
the
marriage
it
was
hard
for
a
child
brought
up
in
the
harem
amid
the
luxury
and
comfort
of
a
civilised
court
to
be
handed
over
to
a
spouse
but
state
policy
even
in
those
days
was
exacting
and
more
than
one
princess
of
the
line
of
sargon
had
thus
sacrificed
herself
by
an
alliance
which
was
to
the
interest
of
her
own
people
bartatua
is
according
to
ingenious
observation
the
of
herodotus
the
father
of
madyes
the
name
should
more
probably
be
read
ed
sargon
had
in
like
manner
given
one
of
his
daughters
in
marriage
to
ambaris
king
of
tabal
in
order
to
attach
him
to
the
assyrian
cause
but
without
permanent
success
what
troubled
esarhaddon
was
not
the
thought
of
sacrificing
a
sister
or
a
daughter
but
a
misgiving
that
the
sacrifice
would
not
produce
the
desired
result
and
in
his
difficulty
he
once
more
had
recourse
to
shamash
esarhaddon
king
of
assyria
grants
a
daughter
of
the
blood
royal
to
bartatua
the
king
of
the
iskuza
who
has
sent
an
embassy
to
him
to
ask
a
wife
will
bartatua
king
of
the
iskuza
act
loyally
towards
esarhaddon
king
of
assyria
will
he
honestly
and
faithfully
enter
into
friendly
engagements
with
esarhaddon
king
of
assyria
will
he
observe
the
conditions
made
by
esarhaddon
king
of
assyria
will
he
fulfil
them
punctually
that
thy
high
divinity
knoweth
his
promises
in
a
decree
and
in
the
mouth
of
thy
high
divinity
o
shamash
great
lord
are
they
decreed
promulgated
it
is
not
recorded
what
came
of
these
negotiations
nor
whether
the
god
granted
the
hand
of
the
princess
to
her
barbarian
suitor
all
we
know
is
that
the
incursions
and
intrigues
of
the
scythians
continued
to
be
a
perpetual
source
of
trouble
to
the
medes
and
roused
them
either
to
rebel
against
assyria
or
to
claim
the
protection
of
its
sovereign
esarhaddon
in
the
course
of
his
reign
was
more
than
once
compelled
to
interfere
in
order
to
ensure
peace
and
quietness
to
the
provinces
on
the
of
iran
which
sargon
had
conquered
and
which
sennacherib
had
retained
several
recent
historians
allege
that
sennacherib
did
not
keep
the
territories
that
sargon
had
conquered
and
that
the
assyrian
frontier
became
contracted
on
that
side
whereas
the
general
testimony
of
the
known
texts
seems
to
me
to
prove
the
contrary
namely
that
he
preserved
nearly
all
the
territory
annexed
by
his
father
and
that
esarhaddon
was
far
from
diminishing
this
inheritance
if
these
two
kings
mention
only
insignificant
deeds
of
arms
in
the
western
region
it
is
because
the
population
exhausted
by
the
wars
of
the
two
preceding
reigns
easily
recognised
the
ninevite
supremacy
and
paid
tribute
to
the
assyrian
governors
with
sufficient
regularity
to
prevent
any
important
military
expedition
against
them
he
had
first
to
carry
his
arms
to
the
extreme
edge
of
the
desert
into
the
rugged
country
of
patusharra
lying
at
the
foot
of
demavend
rich
in
and
as
yet
untrodden
by
any
king
of
assyria
having
reached
his
destination
he
captured
two
petty
kings
eparna
and
shîtirparna
and
exiled
them
to
assyria
together
with
their
people
their
thoroughbred
horses
and
their
camels
in
fine
all
the
possessions
of
their
subjects
shortly
after
this
three
other
median
chiefs
hitherto
intractable
uppis
of
zanasana
of
partukka
ramatea
of
urakazabarna
came
to
nineveh
to
present
the
king
with
horses
and
the
best
of
everything
they
possessed
and
piteously
entreated
him
to
forgive
their
misdeeds
the
country
of
patusharra
has
been
identified
with
that
of
the
patischorians
mentioned
by
strabo
in
persia
proper
who
would
have
lived
further
north
not
far
from
demavend
sachau
calls
attention
to
the
existence
of
a
mountain
chain
or
in
front
of
choarcnê
and
he
places
the
country
of
patusharra
between
demavend
and
the
desert
partakka
and
partukka
seem
to
be
two
different
adaptations
of
the
name
paraituka
the
parsetakênô
of
the
greek
geographers
tiele
thinks
of
parthyênô
i
think
that
these
two
names
designate
the
northern
districts
of
partetakênô
the
present
ashnakhor
or
the
country
near
to
it
they
represented
that
the
whole
of
media
was
torn
asunder
by
countless
strifes
prince
against
prince
city
against
city
and
an
iron
will
was
needed
to
bring
the
more
turbulent
elements
to
order
esarhaddon
lent
a
favourable
ear
to
their
prayers
he
undertook
to
protect
them
on
condition
of
their
paying
an
annual
tribute
and
he
put
them
under
the
protection
of
the
assyrian
governors
who
were
nearest
to
their
territory
kharkhar
securely
entrenched
behind
its
triple
ramparts
assumed
the
position
of
capital
to
these
iranian
marches
it
is
difficult
to
determine
the
precise
dates
of
these
various
events
we
learn
merely
that
they
took
place
before
and
we
surmise
that
they
must
have
occurred
between
the
second
and
sixteenth
year
of
the
reign
the
facts
relating
to
the
submission
of
patusharra
and
of
partukka
are
contained
in
cylinder
a
dated
from
the
eponymous
year
of
akhazilu
in
moreover
the
version
which
this
document
contains
seems
to
have
been
made
up
of
two
pieces
placed
one
at
the
end
of
the
other
the
first
an
account
of
events
which
occurred
during
an
earlier
period
of
the
reign
and
in
which
the
exploits
are
classified
in
geographical
order
from
sidon
in
the
west
the
arabs
bordering
on
chaldæa
in
the
east
and
the
second
consisting
of
additional
campaigns
carried
out
after
the
completion
of
the
former
which
is
proved
by
the
place
which
these
exploits
occupy
out
of
their
normal
position
in
the
geographical
series
and
making
mention
of
partusharra
and
partuhka
as
well
as
of
belikisha
the
editor
of
the
has
tried
to
combine
these
latter
elements
with
the
former
in
the
order
adopted
by
the
original
narrator
as
far
as
can
be
seen
in
what
is
left
of
the
columns
he
has
placed
after
the
chaldsean
events
the
facts
concerning
partukka
then
those
concerning
patusharra
and
finally
the
campaign
against
bazu
the
extreme
limit
of
activity
in
the
south
knowing
that
the
campaign
in
the
desert
and
the
death
of
abdimilkôt
took
place
in
and
that
we
find
them
already
alluded
to
in
the
first
part
of
the
narrative
as
well
as
the
events
of
relating
to
the
revolt
of
dakkuri
we
may
conclude
that
the
submission
of
patusharra
and
that
of
partukka
occurred
in
or
at
latest
in
the
beginning
of
illustration
the
town
of
kharkhar
with
its
triple
rampart
drawn
by
from
flandin
in
botta
the
outcome
of
them
was
a
distinct
gain
to
assyria
in
the
acquisition
of
several
new
vassals
the
recently
founded
kingdom
of
ecbatana
lacked
as
yet
the
prestige
which
would
have
enabled
it
to
hold
its
own
against
nineveh
besides
which
deïokes
the
contemporary
ruler
assigned
to
it
by
tradition
was
of
too
complaisant
a
nature
to
seek
occasions
of
quarrel
the
scythians
after
having
declared
their
warlike
intentions
seem
to
have
come
to
a
more
peaceable
frame
of
mind
and
to
have
curried

the
rulers
of
the
capital
kept
a
strict
watch
upon
them
since
their
numbers
their
intrepid
character
and
instinct
for
rapine
made
them
formidable
enemies
the
most
dangerous
indeed
that
the
empire
had
encountered
on
its
frontier
for
nearly
a
century
this
policy
of
armed
which
proved
so
successful
in
these
regions
was
also
carefully
maintained
by
esarhaddon
on
his
border
against
traditional
enemy
the
king
of
susa
babylon
far
from
exhibiting
any
restlessness
at
her
present
position
showed
her
gratitude
for
the
favours
which
her
suzerain
had
showered
upon
her
by
resigning
herself
to
become
the
ally
of
assyria
she
regarded
her
late
disaster
as
the
punishment
inflicted
by
marduk
for
her
revolts
against
sargon
and
sennacherib
the
god
had
let
loose
the
powers
of
evil
against
her
and
the
arakhtu
overflowing
among
the
ruins
had
swept
them
utterly
away
indeed
for
the
space
of
ten
years
destruction
and
desolation
seemed
to
have
taken
the
place
of
her
former
wealth
of
temples
and
palaces
in
the
eleventh
year
the
divine
wrath
was
suddenly
appeased
no
sooner
had
esarhaddon
mounted
the
throne
than
he
entreated
shamash
rammân
and
even
marduk
himself
to
reveal
to
him
their
will
with
regard
to
the
city
whereupon
the
omens
interpreted
by
the
seers
commanded
him
to
rebuild
babylon
and
to
raise
again
the
temple
of
for
this
purpose
he
brought
together
all
the
captives
taken
in
war
that
he
had
at
his
disposal
and
employed
them
in
digging
out
clay
and
in
he
then
prepared
the
foundations
upon
which
he
poured
libations
of
oil
honey
and
other
wines
of
various
kinds
he
himself
took
the
hod
and
with
tools
of
ebony
cypress
wood
and
oak
moulded
a
brick
for
the
new
sanctuary
the
work
was
indeed
a
gigantic
undertaking
and
demanded
years
of
uninterrupted
labour
but
esarhaddon
pushed
it
forward
sparing
neither
gold
silver
costly
stone
rare
woods
or
plates
of
enamel
in
its
embellishment
he
began
to
rebuild
at
the
same
time
all
the
other
temples
and
the
two
city
walls
imgurbel
and
nimittibel
to
clear
and
make
good
the
canals
which
supplied
the
place
with
water
and
to
replant
the
sacred
groves
and
the
gardens
of
the
palace
the
inhabitants
were
encouraged
to
come
back
to
their
homes
and
those
who
had
been
dispersed
among
distant
provinces
were
supplied
with
clothes
and
food
for
their
return
journey
besides
having
their
patrimony
restored
to
them
this
rebuilding
of
the
ancient
city
certainly
displeased
and
no
doubt
alarmed
her
two
former
rivals
the
kaldâ
and
elam
who
had
hoped
one
day
to
wrest
her
heritage
from
assyria
elam

the
kaldâ

invaded
the
almost
deserted

appropriated
the
lands

had
belonged
to
the
noble
families
of
babylon
borsippa
and
sippara
when
the
latter
therefore
returned
from
exile
and
having
been
reinstituted
in
their
rights
attempted
to
resume
possession
of
their
property
the
usurpers
peremptorily
refused
to
relinquish
it
esarhaddon
was
obliged
to
interfere
to
ensure
its
restoration
and
as
their
king
was
not
inclined
to
comply
with
the
order
esarhaddon
removed
him
from
the
throne
and
substituted
in
his
place
a
certain
nabushallim
son
of
belesys
who
showed
more
deference
to
the
wishes
it
is
possible
that
about
this
time
the
kaldâ
may
have
received
some
support
from
the
aramaeans
of
the
desert
and
the
arab
tribes
encamped
between
the
banks
of
the
euphrates
and
syria

on
the
other
hand
the
latter
may
have
roused
the
wrath
of
assyria
by
inroads
of
a
more
than
usually
audacious
character
however
this
may
be
in
esarhaddon
resolved
to
invade
their
desert
territory
and
to
inflict
such
reprisals
as
would
force
them
thenceforward
to
respect

neighbouring

of

defeated
by
sennacherib

the

reign

taken
the
opportunity
of
the
annual
tribute
to
come
to
nineveh
with
considerable
presents
and
to
implore
the
restoration
of
the
statues
of

esarhaddon
had
caused
these
battered
idols
to
be
cleaned
and
repaired
had
engraved
upon
them
an
inscription
in
praise
of
assur

had
further
married
the
suppliant
sheikh
to
a
woman
of
the
royal
harem
named
tabua

consideration
of
this

had
imposed
upon

supplementary
tribute

incited
the

rebel

threatened
to
overthrow
him
esarhaddon
caused
uahab
to
be
seized
and
exposed
him
in
chains
at
the
gate
of
nineveh

in
consideration
of
this
service

augmented

this
policy
must
have
been
due
to
a
presentiment
of
danger
from
the
side
of
egypt
or
to
the
inception
of
a
great
scheme
for
attacking
the

pharaoh
after
the
defeat
of

his
authority
over

it

no

to
meet
with
his
cartouches

the

ever
held
the

rank
it
was
from
his
mother
âkaluka
that
he
inherited
his
pretensions
to
the
crown
and
through
her
probably
that
he
traced
his
descent
from
the
family

the

that
he
did
not
gain
the

power
without
a

drawn
by
from
a
cast
of
the
fragment
preserved
at

we
may
surmise
that
when
once
absolute
master
of
egypt
he
must
have
cast
his
eyes
beyond
the
isthmus
and
considered
how
he
might
turn
to
his
own
advantage
the
secret
grudge
borne
by
the
syrians
against
their
suzerain
at
nineveh
but
up
to
the
present
time
we
possess
no
indications
as
to
the
policy
he
pursued
in
palestine
we
may
safely
assume
however
that
it
gave
umbrage
to
the
assyrians
and
that
esarhaddon
resolved
to
put
an
end
once
for
all
to
the
uneasiness
it
caused
him
more
than
half
a
century
had
elapsed
since
the
day
when
the
kings
of
syria
alarmed
at
the
earliest
victories
of
had
conceived
the
idea
of
pitting
their
former
conquerors
against
those
of
the
day
and
had
solicited
help
from
the
pharaohs
against
assyria
none
of
the
sovereigns
to
whom
they
turned
had
refused
to
listen
to
their
appeals
or
failed
to
promise
subsidies
and
reinforcements
but
these
engagements
however
definite
had
for
the
most
part
been
left
unfulfilled
and
when
an
occasion
for
their
execution
had
occurred
the
egyptian
armies
had
merely
appeared
on
the
fields
of
battle
to
beat
a
hasty
retreat
they
had
not
prevented
the
subjugation
of
damascus
israel
tyre
the
philistines
nor
indeed
of
any
of
the
princes
or
people
who
trusted
to
their
renown
yet
notwithstanding
these
numerous
disappointments
the
prestige
of
the
egyptians
was
still
so
great
that
insubordinate
or
rebel
states
invariably
looked
to
them
for
support
and
entreated
their
help
the
assyrian
generals
had
learnt
by
experience
to
meet
them
unmoved
being
well
aware
that
the
egyptian
army
was
inferior
to
their
own
in
organisation
and
used
antiquated
weapons
and
methods
of
warfare
they
were
also
well
aware
that
the
egyptian
and
even
the
ethiopian
soldiery
had
never
been
able
successfully
to
withstand
a
determined
attack
by
the
assyrian
battalions
and
that
when
once
the
desert
which
protected
egypt
had
been
crossed
she
would
like
babylon
fall
an
easy
prey
to
their
arms
it
would
merely
be
necessary
to
guard
against
the
possible
danger
of
opposition
being
offered
to
the
passage
of
the
invading
host
by
the
idumoan
and
arab
tribes
sparsely
scattered
over
the
country
between
the
nile
and
the
gulf
of
akabah
as
their
hostility
would
be
a
cause
of
serious
uneasiness
an
expedition
sent
against
in
had
taught
the
inhabitants
to
respect
the
power
of
assyria
but
the
campaign
had
not
been
brought
to
a
satisfactory
conclusion
for
the
king
of
elam
seeing
his
rival
occupied
at
the
opposite
extremity
of
his
empire
fell
unexpectedly
upon
babylon
and
pushing
forward
as
far
as
sippara
laid
waste
the
surrounding
country
and
his
hateful
presence
even
prevented
the
god
shamash
from
making
his
annual
progress
outside
the
walls
of
the
city
the
people
of
seem
to
have
plucked
up
courage
at
his
approach
and
invaded
the
neighbouring
territory
probably
that
of
borsippa
esarhaddon
was
absent
on
a
distant
expedition
and
the
garrisons
scattered
over
the
province
were
not
sufficiently
strong
in
numbers
to
risk
a
pitched
battle
therefore
marched
back
with
his
booty
to
susa
entirely
unmolested
he
died
suddenly
in
his
palace
a
few
days
after
his
return
and
was
succeeded
by
his
brother
urtaku
who
was
too
intent
upon
seating
himself
securely
on
the
throne
to
send
his
troops
on
a
second
raid
in
the
following
year
the
name
of
milukhkha
first
applied
to
the
countries
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
persian
gulf
had
been
transferred
to
the
western
coasts
of
arabia
as
well
as
that
of
magan
esarhaddon
deferred
his
revenge
to
a
more
convenient
season
and
utilised
the
respite
fate
had
accorded
him
on
the
elamite
border
to
hasten
his
attack
on
egypt
the
expedition
was
a
failure
and
taharqa
was
greatly
elated
at
having
issued
with
honour
from
this
trial
of
strength
as
most
of
the
countries
over
which
his
enemy
exercised
his
supremacy
were
those
which
had
been
ruled
by
his
theban
ancestors
in
days
gone
by
taharqa
engraved
on
the
base
of
his
statue
a
list
of
nations
and
towns
copied
from
one
of
the
monuments
of
ramses
ii
the
khâti
carchemish
mitanni
arvad
in
short
a
dozen
peoples
already
extinct
or
in
their
decline
and
whose
names
were
merely
perpetuated
in
the
stereotyped
official
lists
were
enumerated
in
the
list
of
his
vanquished
foes
side
by
side
with
assyria
it
was
a
mere
piece
of
bravado
for
never
even
when
victorious
did
he
set
foot
on
syrian
soil
but
all
the
same
the
victory
had
caused
the
invading
host
to
retire
and
the
fame
of
this
exploit
spreading
throughout
asia
was
not
without
its
effect
on
the
minds
of
the
inhabitants
the
island
of
tyre
had
never
officially
recognised
the
assyrian
suzerainty
the
tyrians
had
lived
in
peace
since
the
defeat
of
elulai
and
had
maintained
constant
commercial
relations
with
the
continent
without
interfering
in
active
politics
they
had
perhaps
even
been
permitted
to
establish
some
settlements
on
the
coast
of
the
mainland
their
king
bâal
now
deemed
the
moment
a
propitious
one
for
coming
forward
and
recovering
his
lost
territory
and
since
the
greek
princes
of
cyprus
had
ranged
themselves
under
the
hegemony
of
assyria
he
thought
he
could
best
counterbalance
their
influence
by
seeking
support
from
egypt
whose
ancient
greatness
was
apparently
reviving
he
therefore
concluded
an
alliance
with
taharqa
and
it
would
be
no
cause
for
astonishment
if
we
should
one
day
discover
that
judah
had
followed
his
example
the
alliance
of
bâal
with
taharqa
is
mentioned
in
the
fragment
of
the
under
the
date
of
year
and
the
name
bâal
is
still
decipherable
amid
the
defaced
linos
which
contained
the
account
of
events
which
took
place
before
that
year
i
think
we
may
reasonably
assign
the
first
understanding
between
the
two
sovereigns
either
to
the
actual
year
of
the
first
campaign
or
to
the
following
year
hezekiah
had
devoted
his
declining
years
to
religious
reformation
and
the
organisation
of
his
kingdom
under
the
guidance
of
isaiah
or
the
group
of
prophets
of
which
isaiah
was
the
leader
judah
had
increased
in
population
and
had
quickly
recovered
its
prosperity
when
hezekiah
died
about
it
had
entirely
regained
its
former
vigour
but
the
memory
of
the
disasters
of
was
still
sufficiently
fresh
in
the
minds
of
the
people
to
prevent
the
change
of
sovereign
being
followed
by
a
change
of
policy
manasseh
who
succeeded
his
father
though
he
did
not
walk
as
hezekiah
had
done
in
the
ways
of
the
lord
at
least
remained
loyal
to
his
assyrian
masters
it
is
however
asserted
that
he
afterwards
rebelled
though
his
reason
for
doing
so
is
not
explained
and
that
he
was
carried
captive
to
babylon
as
a
punishment
for
this
crime
he
succeeded
nevertheless
in
regaining
favour
and
was
reinstated
at
jerusalem
on
condition
of
not
repeating
his
offence
if
this
statement
is
true
as
i
believe
it
to
be
it
was
probably
after
the
egyptian
campaign
of
that
his
conspiracy
with
baal
took
place
the
fact
of
captivity
is
only
known
to
us
from
the
testimony
of
chron
xxxiii
and
most
modern
critics
consider
it
apocryphal
the
moral
development
which
accompanies
the
narrative
and
the
conversion
which
follows
it
are
certainly
later
additions
but
the
story
may
have
some
foundation
in
fact
we
shall
see
later
on
that
necho
king
of
sais
was
taken
prisoner
led
into
captivity
and
received
again
into
favour
in
the
same
way
as
manasseh
is
said
to
have
been
the
exile
to
babylon
which
at
one
time
appeared
to
demonstrate
the
unauthenticity
of
the
passage
would
be
rather
in
favour
of
its
authenticity
esarhaddon
was
king
of
babylon
during
the
whole
of
his
reign
and
the
great
works
which
he
executed
in
that
city
obliged
him
we
know
to
transport
thither
a
large
proportion
of
the
prisoners
whom
he
brought
back
from
his
wars
the
assyrian
governors
of
the
neighbouring
provinces
easily
crushed
these
attempts
at
independence
but
the
islands
of
tyre
being
secure
from
attack
they
were
obliged
to
be
content
with
establishing
a
series
of
redoubts
along
the
coast
and
with
prohibiting
the
tyrians
from
having
access
to
the
mainland
the
promptitude
of
their
action
quenched
the
hopes
of
the
egyptian
party
and
prevented
the
spread
of
the
revolt
esarhaddon
was
nevertheless
obliged
to
put
off
the
fulfilment
of
his
schemes
longer
than
he
desired
complications
arose
on
his
northern
frontiers
near
the
sources
of
the
tigris
which
distracted
his
attention
from
the
intrigues
taking
place
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
urartu
hard
pressed
by
the
cimmerians
and
scythians
had
lived
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
in
a
condition
of
sullen
peace
with
assyria
and
its
kings
avoided
anything
which
could
bring
them
into
conflict
with
their
hereditary
rival
argistis
ii
had
been
succeeded
by
one
of
his
sons
eusas
il
and
both
of
them
had
been
more
intent
upon
strengthening
their
kingdom
than
on
extending
its
area
they
had
rebuilt
their
capital
dhuspas
on
a
magnificent
scale
and
from
the
security
of
their
rocky
home
they
watched
the
course
of
events
without
taking
any
part
in
it
unless
forced
to
do
so
by
circumstances
andaria
chief
of
lubdi
one
of
the
remote
mountain
districts
so
difficult
of
access
that
it
always
retained
its
independence
in
spite
of
frequent
attacks
had
seized
shupria
a
province
which
had
been
from
very
early
times
subject
to
the
sovereigns
of
nineveh
and
was
the
first
to
be
colonised
by
them
the
inhabitants
forgetful
of
their
origin
had
yielded
voluntarily
to
andaria
but
this
prince
after
receiving
their
homage
was
seized
with
alarm
at
his
own
audacity
he
endeavoured
to
strengthen
his
position
by
an
alliance
with
the
cimmerians
and
the
spirit
of
insubordination
which
he
aroused
spread
beyond
the
euphrates
mugallu
of
milid
a
king
of
the
tabal
resorted
to
such
violent
measures
that
esarhaddon
was
alarmed
lest
the
wild
mountaineers
of
the
taurus
should
pour
down
upon
the
plain
of
kuî
and
lay
it
waste
the
danger
would
indeed
have
been
serious
had
all
these
tribes
risen
simultaneously
but
the
cimmerians
were
detained
in
asia
minor
by
their
own
concerns
and
mugallu
when
he
saw
the
assyrian
troops
being
concentrated
to
bring
him
to
reason
remained
quiet
this
seems
indeed
to
be
proved
by
a
tablet
in
which
esarhaddon
addressing
the
god
shamash
asks
him
if
the
cimmerians
or
urartians
will
unite
with
a
certain
prince
who
can
be
no
other
than
the
king
of
shupria
it
was
about
this
time
they
were
dealing
the
to
the
kingdom
of
phrygia
the
extension
of
lubdi
was
not
likely
to
meet
with
favour
in
the
eyes
of
eusas
he
did
not
respond
to
the
advances
made
to
him
and
esarhaddon
opened
his
campaign
against
the
rebels
without
having
to
dread
the
intervention
of
urartu
andaria
besieged
in
his
capital
of
ubbumi
laid
aside
his
royal
robes
and
assuming
the
ragged
garments
of
a
slave
appeared
upon
the
ramparts
and
pleaded
for
mercy
in
a
voice
choked
with
tears
the
country
which
has
sinned
against
thee
will
yield
to
thee
of
her
own
accord
place
thy
officers
over
her
she
will
vow
obedience
to
thee
impose
on
her
a
ransom
and
an
annual
tribute
for
ever
i
am
a
robber
and
for
the
crime
i
have
committed
i
will
make
amends
esarhaddon
would
listen
to
no
terms
before
a
breach
had
been
effected
in
the
city
walls
this
done
he
pardoned
the
prince
who
had
taken
refuge
in
the
citadel
but
resumed
possession
of
shupria
its
inhabitants
were
mercilessly
punished
being
condemned
to
slavery
and
their
lands
and
goods
divided
among
new
colonists
many
urartians
were
numbered
among
the
captives
these
esarhaddon
separated
from
the
rest
and
sent
back
to
rusas
as
a
reward
for
his
having
remained
neutral
all
this
had
barely
occupied
the
space
of
one
month
the
month
of
tebet
the
of
the
spoil
reserved
for
uruk
had
already
reached
that
town
by
the
month
kislev
and
the
year
was
not
so
far
advanced
as
to
render
further
undertakings
impossible
when
the
death
of
the
queen
on
the
adar
suspended
all
warlike
enterprises
the
last
months
of
the
year
were
given
up
to
mourning
and
the
whole
of
passed
without
further
action
the
ethiopian
king
was
emboldened
by
this
inactivity
on
the
part
of
his
foe
to
renew
his
intrigues
with
syria
with
redoubled
energy
at
one
moment
indeed
the
philistines
of
ashkelon
secretly
instigated
seemed
on
the
point
of
revolt
ashkelon
is
mentioned
in
two
of
the
prayers
in
which
esarhaddon
consults
shamash
on
the
subject
of
his
intended
campaign
in
egypt
he
seems
to
fear
lest
that
city
and
the
bedâwin
of
the
idumoan
desert
should
espouse
the
cause
of
the
king
of
ethiopia
they
held
themselves
however
in
check
and
esarhaddon
reassured
as
to
their
attitude
entered
into
negotiations
with
the
sheikhs
of
the
arab
tribes
and
purchased
their
assistance
to
cross
the
desert
of
sinai
he
bade
them
assemble
at
raphia
at
the
western
extremity
of
palestine
each
chief
bringing
all
the
camels
he
could
command
and
as
many
skins
of
water
as
their
beasts
could
carry
this
precaution
a
wise
one
at
any
time
might
secure
the
safety
of
the
army
in
case
taharqa
should
have
filled
up
the
wells
which
marked
the
stages
in
the
caravan
route
when
all
was
ready
esarhaddon
consulted
the
oracle
of
shamash
and
on
receiving
a
favourable
reply
from
the
god
left
nineveh
in
the
beginning
of
the
month
nisân
to
join
the
invading
army
in
syria
this
information
is
furnished
by
the
fragment
of
the
the
assyrian
text
introduces
this
into
the
narrative
in
such
a
manner
that
it
would
appear
as
if
these
negotiations
were
carried
on
at
the
very
commencement
of
the
campaign
it
is
however
more
probable
that
they
were
concluded
beforehand
as
occurred
later
on
in
the
time
of
cambyses
when
the
persians
invaded
egypt
the
published
texts
refer
to
the
second
egyptian
campaign
of
esarhaddon
the
reply
of
the
god
is
not
easy
to
interpret
but
it
was
certainly
favourable
since
the
expedition
took
place
he
made
a
detour
in
order
to
inspect
the
lines
of
forts
which
his
generals
had
established
along
the
coast
opposite
tyre
and
strengthened
their
garrisons
to
prevent
bâal
from
creating
a
diversion
in
the
rear
of
his
base
of
operations
he
then
proceeded
southwards
to
the
neighbourhood
of
aphek
in
the
territory
of
the
tribe
of
simeon
the
news
which
there
met
him
must
doubtless
have
informed
him
that
the
bedâwin
had
been
won
over
in
the
interval
by
the
emissaries
of
taharqa
and
that
he
would
run
great
risk
by
proceeding
with
his
campaign
before
bringing
them
back
to
a
sense
of
their
duty
on
leaving
he
consequently
turned
southwards
and
plunged
into
the
heart
of
the
desert
as
if
he
had
renounced
all
designs
upon
egypt
for
that
season
and
was
bent
only
on
restoring
order
in
milukhkha
and
magân
before
advancing
further
for
six
weeks
he
marched
in
short
stages
without
other
water
than
the
supply
borne
in
accordance
with
his
commands
by
the
arab
camels
passing
through
tracts
of
desert
infested
by
strange
birds
and
serpents
when
he
had
at
length
dispersed
the
bands
which
had
endeavoured
to
oppose
his
advance
he
suddenly
turned
in
a
direction
and
following
the
dry
bed
of
the
torrent
of
muzur
at
length
reached
raphia
from
thence
he
did
not
select
the
usual
route
which
follows
the
and
leads
to
pelusium
a
place
which
he
may
have
feared
was
too
well
defended
but
he
again
pressed
forward
across
the
sands
of
the
desert
and
in
the
first
days
of
tammuz
reached
the
cultivated
land
of
the
delta
by
way
of
the
wady
tumilât
the
frontier
garrisons
defeated
on
the
of
tammuz
near
ishkhupri
retreated
in
good
order
the
defaced
name
of
the
country
in
which
this
aphek
was
situated
was
read
as
samirina
and
translated
by
the
first
editor
this
interpretation
has
been
adopted
by
most
historians
who
have
seen
in
aphek
the
town
of
this
name
belonging
to
the
western
portion
of
manasseh
budge
read
it
samina
and
this
reading
verified
by
craig
gave
winckler
the
idea
of
identifying
samina
or
simina
with
the
tribe
of
simeon
and
aphek
with
the
aphckah
josh

in
the
mountains

the
text
on
the
stele
at
zinjirli
gives
a
total
of
fifteen
march
from
ishkhupri
to
memphis

babyl

indicates
three
battles
as
having
been
fought
on
the
and
of
tammuz

the
taking
of

occurring
on
the
of
the

precisely
accurate

in

conflicts

of
which
fought

regular

battles
but
in
every
case
the
assyrian

triumphed
in

of
the
dashing

egyptians

a
few
hours

with
his
army
decimated
and
exhausted
gave
up
the
struggle
and
beat
a
hasty
retreat
southwards
the
attack
had
been
made
with
such
rapidity
that
he
had
had
no
time
to
remove
his
court
from
the
of
the
white
to
the
said

queen
therefore
together
with
other
women
of
less
exalted
rank
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
conqueror

the
several
younger
sons
and
daughters
and
such
of
the
children
of
sabaco
and
shabîtoku
as
resided
at
court
but
the
victory
had
cost
the
assyrians
dearly
and
the
enemy
still
appeared
to
them
so
formidable
that
esarhaddon
prudently
abstained
from
pursuing
him
up
the
nile
valley
he
favourably
received
those
feudal
lords
and
petty
kings
who
presented
themselves
to
pay
him
homage
and
confirmed
them
in
possession
of
their
fiefs
but
he
placed
over
them
assyrian
governors
and
imposed
new
official
names
on
their
cities
thus
athribis
was
officially
called
and
other
cities
received
the
names
he
further
imposed
on
them
a
heavy
annual
tribute
of
more
than
six
talents
of
gold
and
six
hundred
talents
of
silver
besides
robes
and
woven
stuffs
wine
skins
horses
sheep
and
asses
and
having
accomplished
this
he
retraced
his
steps
towards
the
with
immense
booty
and
innumerable
convoys
of
prisoners
the
complete
defeat
of
the
ethiopian
power
filled
not
only
esarhaddon
himself
but
all
asia
with
astonishment
his
return
to
nineveh

a
triumphal
progress
travelling
through
syria
by
short
stages
he
paraded
his
captives

as
among
her
friends
that
egypt
was
effectually
protected

proved
that

was
no

had
vied
with
one

in
supplying
esarhaddon
with

the

enabled
esarhaddon
to
complete
this
palace
and
begin
a
new
one

the
buildings
erected
somewhat
hurriedly

pared
down

had
however
hardly
been
placed

it
may
have
been
that
esarhaddon
had
to
suspend
all
his
operations
while
putting
down
some
conspiracy
at
any
rate
we
know
that
in
many
high
personages
of
his
court
were
seized
and
executed
the
question
of
the
succession
to
the
throne
was
still
undecided
the
son
whom
esarhaddon
had
previously
designated
as
his
heir
presumptive
was
dead
and
the
people
feared
lest
he
should
choose
from
among
his
other
sons
some
prince
who
had
not
their
interests
at
heart
the
affection
for
babylon
had
certainly
aroused
jealousy
and
anxiety
among
his
assyrian
subjects
and
perhaps
some
further
tokens
of
preference
made
them
uneasy
he
should
select
one
of
his
children
who
manifested
the
same
tendencies
and
who
was
moreover
the
son
of
a
babylonian
wife
most
of
the
nobles
who
had
been
led
to
join
the
conspiracy
paid
for
their
indiscretion
with
their
heads
but
their
opposition
gave
the
sovereign
cause
for
reflection
and
decided
him
to
modify
his
schemes
convinced
that
it
was
impossible
to
unite
babylon
and
nineveh
permanently
under
the
same
ruler
he
reluctantly
decided
to
divide
his
kingdom
into
two
parts
assyria
the
strongest
portion
falling
naturally
to
his
eldest
son
while
babylonia
was
assigned
to
on
condition
of
his
paying
homage
to
his
brother
as
suzerain
the
best
method
to
ensure
his
wishes
being
carried
into
effect
was
to
prepare
their
way
for
the
fulfilment
while
he
was
still
alive
and
rebellions
which
broke
out
about
this
time
beyond
the
isthmus
afforded
a
good
opportunity
for
so
doing
egypt
was
at
this
period
divided
into
twenty
states
of
various
dimensions
very
nearly
the
same
as
had
existed

side
of

the
heirs
of
the
ancient
dynasties
of
tanis
and
bubastis
and
his
energy
or
ability
must
have
made
a
good
impression
on
the
minds
of
his
contemporaries
for
they
handed
down
his
memory
to
their
successors

soon
metamorphosed
him
into
a
popular
legendary
hero
famed

for
his
valour
and

sway
sabaco
having
put
his
rival
to
death
had
installed
in
his
hereditary
domains
an
ethiopian
named
ammeris
but
this
ammeris
had
disappeared
from
the
scene
about
the
same
time
as
his
patron
in
and
after
him
three
princes
at
least
had
succeeded
to
the
throne
namely
stephinates
nekhepsos
and
necho
stephinates
had
died
about
without
accomplishing
anything
which
was
worth
recording
nekhepsos
had
had
no
greater
opportunities
of
distinguishing
himself
than
had
fallen
to
the
lot
of
his
father
and
yet
legends
grew
up
round
his
name
as
round
that
of
pakruru
he
was
reputed
to
have
been
a
great
soothsayer
astrologist
and
magician
and
medical
treatises
were
ascribed
to
him
and
almanacs
much
esteemed
by
the
superstitious
in
the
roman
period

lists
of
eusebius
give
the
series
ammeres
stephinates
nekhepsos
necho
but
lepsius
displaced
ammeres
and
identified
him
with
the
queen
amenertas
others
have
thought
to
recognise
in
him
miamun
piônkhi
or
tanuatamanu
the
successor
of
taharqa
he
must
however
be
left
in
this
place
in
the
list
and
we
may
perhaps
consider
him
as
the
founder
of
the
xxvith
dynasty
if
the
number
of
seven
years
for
the
reign
of
stephinates
is
adopted
we
must
suppose
either
that
manetho
passed
over
the
name
of
a
prince
at
the
beginning
of
the
xxvith
dynasty
or
that
ammeris
was
only
enthroned
at
memphis
after
the
death
of
sabaco
but
the
lists
of
the
syncellus
and
of
sothis
assign
years
to
the
reign
of

the
astrological
works
of
nekhepsos
are
cited
among
others
by
pliny
and
it
is
probably
he
whom
a
greek
papyrus
of
the
salt
collection
mentions
under
the
name
of
nekheus
necho
had
already
occupied
the
throne
for
three
or
four
years
when
the
invasion
of
delivered
him
from
the
ethiopian
supremacy
he
is
represented
as
being
brave
energetic
and
enterprising
ready
to
hazard
everything
in
order
to
attain
the
object
towards
which
the
ambition
of
his
ancestors
had
been
tending
for
a
century
past
namely
to
restore
unity
to
the
ancient
kingdom
under
the
rule
of
the
house
of
sais
the
extent
of
his
realm
and
above
all
the
possession
of
memphis
gave
him
a
real
superiority
and
esarhaddon
did
not
hesitate
to
esteem
him
above
his
competitors
the
ninevite
scribes
placed
him
in
the
first
rank
and
he
heads
the
list
of
the
egyptian
vassals
he
soon
had
an
opportunity
of
proving
his
devotion
to
his
foreign
suzerain
taharqa
did
not
quietly
accept
his
defeat
and
egypt
looked
to
him
to
be
revenged
on
the
assyrian
as
soon
as
he
should
have
reorganised
his
army
he
once
more
accordingly
took
the
field
in
the
middle
of
the
barons
of
the

to
his
standard
without
hesitation
and
he
soon
the
wall
but
there
his
advance
was
arrested
necho
and
the
neighbouring
chiefs
of
the
delta
held
in
check
by
the
presence
of
semitic
garrisons
did
not
venture
to
proclaim
themselves
on
his
side
and
awaited
under
arms
the
arrival
of
assyrian
reinforcements
esarhaddon
in
spite
of
failing
health
assumed
command
of
the
troops
and
before
leaving
home
carried
out
the
project
to
which
the
conspiracy
of
the
preceding
year
had
given
rise
he
assigned
the
government
of
babylon
to
and
solemnly
designated
as
the
heir
to
assyria
proper
and
to
the
suzerainty
over
the
whole
empire
the
first
egyptian
campaign
of

also
the
last
campaign
of
esarhaddon
and
appropriated
all
the
earlier
incidents
of
it
some
of
which
belong
to
the
sole
reign
of
his
father
and
some
to
the
few
weeks
in
which
he
shared
the
throne
with
him
the
association
of
with
his
father
on
the
throne
was
pointed
out
by
smith
who
thought
he
could
fix
the
date
about
three
or
four
years
before
the
death
of
esarhaddon
tielo
showed
that
was
then
only
made
viceroy
and
assigned
his
association
in
the
sovereignty
to
the
year
or
about
the
time
of
the
second
egyptian
campaign
while
hommel
brought
it
down
to
winckler
has
with
much
reason
placed
the
date
in
the
assyrian
documents
do
not
mention
the
coronation
of
for
afterwards
affected
to
consider
his
brother
a
mere
viceroy
appointed
by
himself
after
the
death
of
his
father
esarhaddon
but
an
examination
of
all
the
circumstances
has
shown
that
the
enthronement
of
at
babylon
was
on
a
par
with
that
of
at
nineveh
and
that
both
owed
their
elevation
to
their
father
on
the
of
lyyar
on
the
day
of
the
feast
of
gula
he
presented
their
new
lord
to
all
the
inhabitants
of
assyria
both
small
and
great
who
had
assembled
to
be
present
at
the
ceremony
which
ended
in
the
installation
of
the
prince
in
the
palace
of
bîtriduti
reserved
for
the
a
few
weeks
later
esarhaddon
set
out
for
egypt
but
his
malady
became
more
serious
on
the
journey
and
he
died
on
the
of
arakhsamna
in
the
twelfth
year
of
his
reign
arakhsamna
corresponds
to
the
jewish
marcheswân
and
to
our
month
of
may
when
we
endeavour
to
conjure
up
his
image
before
us
we
fancy
we
are
right
in
surmising
that
he
was
not
cast
in
the
ordinary
mould
of
assyrian
monarchs
the
history
of
his
campaigns
shows
that
he
was
as
active
and
resolute
as
and
shalmaneser
but
he
did
not
add
to
these
good
qualities
their
inflexible
harshness
towards
their
subjects
nor
their
brutal
treatment
of
conquered
foes
circumstances
in
which
they
would
have
shown
themselves
merciless
he
seized
upon
as
occasions
for
clemency
and
if
massacres
and
executions
are
recorded
among
the
events
of
his
reign
at
least
he
does
not
class
them
among
the
most
important
the
records
of
his
wars
do
not
continually
speak
of
rebels
flayed
alive
kings
impaled
before
the
gates
of
their
cities
and
whole
populations
decimated
by
fire
and
sword
of
all
the
assyrian
conquerors
he
is
almost
the
only
one
for
whom
the
historian
can
feel
any
regard
or
from
the
study
of
whose
reign
he
passes
on
with
regret
to
pursue
that
of
others
in
due
course
as
soon
as
esarhaddon
had
passed
away
the
separation
of
the
two
parts
of
the
empire
which
he
had
planned
was
effected
almost
automatically
proclaimed
himself
king
of
assyria
and
in
like
manner
king
of
babylon
one
fact
which
seems
insignificant
enough
to
us
when
we
read
it
in
the
annals
but
was
decisive
in
the
eyes
of
their
contemporaries
sanctioned
the
transformation
thus
accomplished
bel
and
the
gods
of
accad
quitted
assur
in
the
month
of
iyyâr
and
returned
to
their
in
babylon
the
restoration
of
the
images
to
their
own
country
became
necessary
as
soon
as
it
was
decided
to
have
a
king
in
karduniash
even
though
he
were
an
assyrian
to
enable
him
to
exercise
legitimate
authority
he
must
have
celebrated
the
rites
and
the
hands
of
bel
but
it
was
a
question
whether
this
obligation
could
be
fulfilled
if
bel
remained
a
prisoner
in
the
neighbouring
capital
believed
for
a
moment
that
this
difficulty
could
be
obviated
and
consulted
shamash
on
this
delicate
question
the
son
of
esarhaddon
the
king
of
assyria
can
he
in
this
year
take
the
hands
of
bel
the
mighty
lord
marduk
in
this
very
city
and
then
go
to
babylon
with
the
favour
of
bel
if
that
would
be
pleasing
to
thy
great
divinity
and
to
the
mighty
lord
marduk
thy
great
divinity
must
know
the
reply
was
not
favourable
and
shamash
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
bel
could
not
act
as
a
sovereign
lord
while
still
languishing
in
prison
in
a
city
which
was
not
his
own
had
to
resign
himself
to
the
release
of
his
captive
and
he
did
it
with
a
good
grace
he
proceeded
in
pomp
to
the
temple
of
assur
where
marduk
was
shut
up
and
humbly
entreated
the
exiled
deity
to
vouchsafe
to
return
to
his
own
country

thou
didst
bring

nought
in

rage
of
thy

turn
thy

thy
city

thou
hast
forsaken

thou
thyself
o
marduk

gods
give
the
command
to
return
to
the

out
on
its
journey
and
was
escorted
by
a
solemn
procession

by
the
two
kings
the

from

cities

he
passed
by

of
borsippa
shamash
of
sippara
and

at
length
he
reached
his
beloved
city
and
entered
in
the
midst
of
an
immense
throng
of
people
the
kings
headed
the
and
the
delighted
multitude
joined
their
two
names
with

the
god
in
their
acclamations

was
a
day
never
to
be
forgotten
in
his
capacity
of
suzerain
opened
the
sacred
edifice
and
then
presented
his
brother
who
thereupon
the
hands
of
illustration
as
a
bearer
of
offerings
drawn
by

from
a
photograph
in
lehmann
a
quarter
of
a
century
had
not
passed
since
the
victorious
sennacherib
had
as
he
thought
inflicted
a
mortal
blow
on
the
one
power
which
stood
in
the
way
of
supremacy
in
western
asia
already
in
spite
of
his
efforts
the
city
had
sprung
up
from
its
ruins
as
vigorous
as
ever
and
his
sons
and
grandsons
had
felt
themselves
irresistibly
drawn
to
resuscitate
that
which
their
ancestors
had
desired
to
annihilate
irrevocably
babylon
had
rebuilt
her
palaces
her
walls
and
her
temples
she
had
received
back
her
gods
without
a
war
and
almost
without
any
agitation
by
the
mere
force
of
the
prestige
she
exercised
over
all
around
her
and
even
over
her
conquerors
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
had
not
regained
her
former
position
and
was
still
depressed
and
enfeebled
by
the
blow
which
had
laid
her
low
in
addition
to
this
her
king
was
an
assyrian
and
a
vassal
of
assyria
but
nevertheless
he
was
her
own
king
and
hers
alone
her
independence
was
already
half
regained
established
his
court
at
babylon
and
applied
himself
from
the
outset
to
restore
as
far
as
he
was
able
the
material
and
moral
forces
of
his
kingdom
on
his
side
met
with
no
opposition
from
his
subjects
but
prudence
cautioned
him
not
to
estrange
them
the
troubles
of
the
preceding
year
were
perhaps
not
so
completely
suppressed
as
to
prevent
the
chiefs
who
had
escaped
punishment
from
being
encouraged
by
the
change
of
sovereign
to
renew
their
intrigues
the
king
therefore
remained
in
nineveh
to
inaugurate
his
rule
and
confided
to
his
generals
the
charge
of
conducting
the
expeditions
which
had
been
undertaken
during
his
lifetime
one
of
these
undertakings
was
unimportant
tandaî
of
kirbît
a
petty
chief
was
continually
engaged
in
harassing
the
inhabitants
of
yamutbal
he
bore
down
upon
them
every
year
and
after
dealing
a
blow
retreated
to
his
in
the
mountains
he
was
attacked
in
his
stronghold
and
carried
away
captive
with
all
his
people
into
egypt
at
the
furthest
extremity
of
the
empire
to
serve
in
assyrian
garrisons
in
the
midst
of
the
fellahîn
in
the
numerous
documents
relating
to
the
reign
of
the
facts
are
arranged
in
geographical
order
not
by
the
dates
of
the
successive
expeditions
and
the
chronological
order
of
the
campaigns
is
all
the
more
difficult
to
determine
accurately
as
babylonian
fails
us
after
the
beginning
of
this
reign
immediately
after
the
mention
of
the
war
with
kirbît
even
the
is
only
accurate
down
to
in
that
year
there
is
a
break
and
although
we
possess
for
the
succeeding
period
more
than
forty
names
of
eponyms
their
classification
is
not
at
present
absolutely
certain
the
expedition
against
kirbît
is
omitted
in
certain
documents
it
is
inserted
in
the
others
in
the
fourth
place
between
the
wars
in
asia
minor
and
the
campaign
against
the
mannai
the
place
assigned
to
it
in
the
bab
chron
quite
in
the
beginning
of
the
reign
is
confirmed
by
a
fragment
of
a
tablet
quoted
by
winckler
perhaps
it
was
carried
out
by
a
babylonian
army
although
claimed
the
glory
of
it
by
reason
of
his
suzerainty
over
karduniash
meanwhile
the
army
which
esarhaddon
had
been
leading
against
taharqa
pursued
its
course
under
command
of
the
tartan
syria
received
it
submissively
and
the
kings
who
still
possessed
a
shadow
of
autonomy
in
the
country
sent
assurances
of
their
devotion
to
the
new
monarch
even
yakînlu
king
of
arvad
who
had
aroused
suspicion
by
frequent
acts
of
insubordination
thought
twice
before
rebelling
against
his
terrible
suzerain
and
joined
the
rest
in
paying
both
homage
and
tribute
cyprus
and
also
phoenicia
remained
faithful
to
their
allegiance
and
what
was
of
still
more
consequence
the
states
which
lay
nearest
to
egypt
philistia
judah
moab
and
ammon
the
assyrians
were
thus
able
to
push
forward
to
the
delta
without
losing
time
in
repressing
rebellions
along
their
route
the
ethiopians
had
entrenched
themselves
at
karbanîti
they
were
however
once
more
defeated
and
left
so
many
of
their
soldiers
dead
upon
the
field
that
taharqa
had
not
sufficient
troops
left
to
defend
memphis
the
text
of
tablet
k
of
the
brit
states
distinctly
that
the
tartan
commanded
the
first
army
acting
in
the
name
of
his
father
esarhaddon
king
of
assyria
had
consulted
shamash
on
the
desirability
of
sending
troops
against
arvad
the
prince
of
this
city
is
called
ikkalu
which
is
a
variant
of
yakînlu
winckler
concluded
that
the
campaign
against
arvad
took
place
before
in
the
reign
of
esarhaddon
it
seems
to
me
more
natural
to
place
it
on
the
return
from
egypt
when
the
people
of
arvad
were
demoralised
by
the
defeat
of
the
pharaoh
whose
alliance
they
had
hoped
for
i
had
compared
karbanîti
with
the
qarbîna
mentioned
in
the
harris
and
this
identification
was
accepted
by
most
egyptologists
even
after
brugsch
recognised
in
qarbîna
the
name
of
canopus
or
a
town
near
canopus
it
has
been
contested
by
steindorf
and
in
fact
karbanîti
could
not
be
identified
with
canopus
any
more
than
the
qarbina
of
the
harris
papyrus
its
site
must
be
looked
for
in
the
eastern
or
central
part
of
the
delta
he
retreated
upon
thebes
where
he
strongly
fortified
himself
but
the
tartan
had
not
suffered
less
than
his
adversary
and
he
would
have
been
unable
to
pursue
him
had
not
reinforcements
promptly
reached
him
the
who
had
been
despatched
from
nineveh
with
some
assyrian
troops
had
summoned
to
his
aid
the
principal
syrian
feudal
chiefs
who
stimulated
by
the
news
of
the
victories
achieved
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
placed
themselves
unreservedly
at
his
disposal
he
ordered
their
vessels
to
proceed
along
the
coast
as
far
as
the
delta
where
he
purposed
to
collect
a
fleet
to
ascend
the
river
while
their
troops
augmented
the
force
already
under
his
command
the
two
assyrian
generals
the
tartan
and
the
rabshakeh
quitted
memphis
probably
in
the
early
part
of
and
cautiously
advancing
southwards
covered
the
distance
separating
the
two
egyptian
capitals
in
a
steady
march
of
forty
days
when
the
assyrians
had
advanced
well
up
the
valley
the
princes
of
the
delta
thought
the
opportunity
had
arrived
to
cut
them
off
by
a
single
bold
stroke
they
therefore
opened
cautious
negotiations
with
the
ethiopian
king
and
proposed
an
arrangement
which
should
secure
their
independence
will
divide
the
country
between
us
and
neither
of
us
shall
exercise
authority
over
the
however
secretly
these
negotiations
were
conducted
they
were
certain
to
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
assyrian
generals
the
couriers
were
intercepted
and
discovering
from
the
despatches
the
extent
of
the
danger
the
assyrians
seized
as
many
of
the
leaders
of
the
league
as
they
could
as
a
warning
they
sacked
sais
mendes
and
tanis
demolishing
the
fortifications
and
flaying
or
impaling
the
principal
citizens
before
their
city
gates
they
then
sent
two
of
the
intriguing
chiefs

sharludari
of

and

with
chains
to

however
to
escape
them
taharqa
thus
bereft
of
his
allies
was
no
longer
in
a
condition
to
repel
the
invader
he
fled
to
ethiopia
abandoning
thebes
to
its
fate
the
city
was
ransomed
by
despoiling
the
temple
of
amon
of
half
its

montumihâît
transferred
his
allegiance
unhesitatingly
to

the
whole
of
egypt
from
the
mediterranean
to
the
first
cataract
once
more
became
assyrian
territory
the
victory
was
so
complete
that
thought
he
might
without
risk
show
clemency
to
his
prisoners
he
summoned
them
to
his
presence
and
there
instead
of
putting
out
their
eyes
or
subjecting
them
to
some
horrible
form
of
torture
he
received
them
back
into
favour
and
confirmed
necho
in
the
possession
of
all
the
honours
which
esarhaddon
had
conceded
to
him
he
clothed
him
in
a
mantle
of
honour
and
bestowed
on
him
a
sword
with
an
iron
scabbard
ornamented
with
gold
engraved
with
his
names
and
titles
besides
rings
gold
bracelets
chariots
horses
and
mules
in
short
all
the
appurtenances
of
royalty
not
content
with
restoring
to
him
the
cities
of
sais
and
memphis
he
granted
him
the
fief
of
athribis

at

but
these
were
incidents
of
slight
moment
and
their
very
insignificance
proves
how
completely
resigned
to
foreign
domination
the
nations
of
the
mediterranean
coast
had
now
become
vassal
kings
princes
cities
peasants
of
the
plain
or
shepherds
of
the
mountains
all
who
were
subject
directly
or
indirectly
to
assyria
had
almost
ceased
to
imagine
that
a
change
of
sovereign
afforded
them
any
chance
of
regaining
their
independence
they
no
longer
considered
themselves
the
subjects
of
a
conqueror
whose
death
might
free
them
from
allegiance
they
realised
that
they
were
the
subjects
of
an
empire
whose
power
did
not
depend
on
the
genius
or
incapacity
of
one
man
but
was
maintained
from
age
to
age
in
virtue
of
the
prestige
it
had
attained
whatever
might
be
the
qualities
of
the
reigning
sovereign
the
other
independent
states
had
at
length
come
to
the
same
conclusion
and
the
news
of
the
accession
of
a
fresh
assyrian
king
no
longer
awakened
among
them
hopes
of
conquest
or
at
all
events
of
booty
such
an
occasion
was
regarded
as
a
suitable
opportunity
for
strengthening
the
bonds
of
neighbourly
feeling
or
conciliatory
friendship
which
united
them
to
assyria
by
sending
an
embassy
to
congratulate
the
new
sovereign
one
of
these
embassies
which
arrived
about
caused
much
excitement
at
the
court
of
nineveh
and
greatly
flattered
the
vanity
of
the
king
reports
brought
back
by
sailors
or
the
chiefs
of
caravans
had
revealed
the
existence
of
a
kingdom
of
lydia
in
the
extreme
west
of
asia
minor
at
the
place
of
embarcation
for
crossing
the
sea
it
is
called
sha
nibirti
country
of
the
crossing
of
the
sea
or
more
concisely
country
this
side
the
it
was
known
to
be
celebrated
for
its
gold
and
its
horses
but
no
direct
relations
between
the
two
courts
had
ever
been
established
and
the
lydian
kings
had
hitherto
affected
to
ignore
the
existence
of
assyria
a
revolution
had
broken
out
in
this
province
a
quarter
of
a
century
previously
which
had
placed
on
the
throne
of
the
heraclidse
that
family
of
the
mermnado
whose
previous
history
had
been
so
tragic
dascylus
who
had
made
his
home
for
a
long
time
among
the
white
syrians
had
no
intention
of
abandoning
his
adopted
country
when
one
day
about
the
year
a
messenger
arrived
bidding
him
repair
to
sardes
without
delay
his
uncle
ardys
prince
of
tyrrha
having
no
children
had
applied
to
sadyattes
beseeching
him
to
revoke
the
sentence
of
banishment
passed
on
his
nephew
house
is
desolate
said
he
all
my
kinsfolk
are
dead
and
furthermore
dascylus
and
his
house
have
already
been
pardoned
by
thine
sadyattes
consented
but
dascylus
preferring
not
to
return
sent
his
son
gyges
then
about
eighteen
years
of
age
in
his
stead
gyges
was
a
tall
and
very
beautiful
youth
and
showed
unusual
skill
as
a
charioteer
and
in
the
use
of
weapons
so
that
his
renown
soon
spread
throughout
the
country
sadyattes
desired
to
see
him
and
being
captivated
by
his
bold
demeanour
enrolled
him
in
his
bodyguard
loaded
him
with
presents
and
took
him
into
his
entire
confidence
gyges
was
clever
enough
to
utilise
the
favour
in
order
to
enlarge
his
domains
and
increase
his
riches
and
thus
win
partisans
among
the
people
and
the
body
of
carian
mercenaries
at
that
time
formed
one
of
the
most
vigorous
and
best
disciplined
contingents
in
the
armies
of
the
period
the
carians
were
above
all
a
military
race
and
are
said
to
have
brought
the
shield
and
helmet
to
their
highest
perfection
at
sardes
they
formed
the
garrison
of
the
citadel
and
their
captains
were
in
high
favour
with
the
king
gyges
formed
a
fast
friendship
with
arselis
of
mylasa
one
of
the
chief
of
these
officers
and
thus
made
sure
of
the
support
of
the
garrison
and
of
the
possibility
of
recruiting
a
corps
among
the
carian
clans
who
remained
in
their
own
country
he
thus
incurred
the
bitter
jealousy
of
the
tylonidag
whose
chief
lixos
was
ready
to
adopt
any
measures
which
might
damage
his
rival
even
going
so
far
as
to
simulate
madness
and
run
through
the
streets
of
sardes
crying
out
that
gyges
the
son
of
dascylus
was
about
to
assassinate
the
king
but
this
stratagem
did
not
succeed
any
better
than
his
other
treacherous
devices
meanwhile
sadyattes
had
sought
the
hand
of
toudô
daughter
of
arnossos
of
mysia
and
sent
his
favourite
to
receive
his
affianced
bride
at
the
hand
of
her
father
archilochus
of
paros
a
contemporary
of
gyges
mentions
the
carian
mercenaries
and
later
on
ephorus
said
of
them
that
they
had
been
the
first
to
sell
their
services
to
strangers
the
connection
between
arselis
and
gyges
is
mentioned
by
plutarch
it
is
not
certain
whether
the
name
is
toudô
or
trydô
gyges
fell
in
love
with
her
on
the
journey
and
tried
in
vain
to
win
her
favour
she
repulsed
his
advances
with
indignation
and
on
the
very
night
of
her
marriage
complained
to
her
husband
of
the
insult
which
had
been
offered
her
sadyattes
swore
that
he
would
avenge
her
on
the
morrow
but
gyges
warned
by
a
servant
slew
the
king
before
daybreak
immediately
after
thus
assassinating
his
sovereign
gyges
called
together
the
and
ridding
himself
of
those
who
were
hostile
to
him
induced
the
others
by
bribes
to
further
his
designs
then
descending
to
the
place
of
public
assembly
he
summoned
the
people
to
a
conclave
after
a
long
and
stormy
debate
it
was
decided
to
consult
the
oracle
at
delphi
which
corrupted
by
the
gold
from
the
pactolus
enjoined
on
the
lydians
to
recognise
gyges
as
their
king
he
married
toudô
and
by
thus
espousing
the
widow
of
the
heraclid
sovereign
obtained
some
show
of
right
to
the
crown
but
the
decision
of
the
oracle
was
not
universally
acceptable
and
war
broke
out
in
which
gyges
was
victorious
thanks
to
the
bravery
of
his
carian
mercenaries
his
career
soon
served
as
the
fabric
on
which
the
popular
imagination
was
continually
working
fresh
embroideries
he
was
reported
at
the
outset
to
have
been
of
base
extraction
a
mere
soldier
of
fortune
who
had
raised
himself
by
degrees
to
the
highest
posts
and
had
finally
supplanted
his
patron
herodotus
following
the
poet
archilochus
of
paros
relates
how
the
last
of
the
heraclidas
whom
he
calls
by
his
private
name
of
kandaules
and
not
his
official
name
of
sadyattes
forcibly
insisted
on
exposing
to
the
admiration
of
gyges
the
naked
beauty
of
his
wife
the
queen
thus
outraged
called
upon
the
favourite
to
avenge
the
insult
to
her
modesty
by
the
blood
of
her
husband
and
then
bestowed
on
him
her
hand
together
with
the
crown
schubert
considers
that
the
names
sadyattes
and
kandaules
belong
to
two
distinct
persons
kandaules
according
to
him
was
probably
a
second
son
of
myrsos
who
after
the
murder
of
sadyattes
disputed
the
possession
of
the
crown
with
gyges
in
this
case
he
was
killed
in
battle
by
the
carian
commander
arselis
as
related
by
plutarch
and
gyges
was
not
really
king
till
after
the
death
of
kandaules
plato
made
this
story
the
groundwork
of
a
most
fantastic
tale
gyges
according
to
him
was
originally
a
shepherd
who
after
a
terrible
storm
noticed
a
fissure
in
the
ground
into
which
he
crept
there
he
discovered
an
enormous
bronze
horse
half
broken
and
in
its
side
the
corpse
of
a
giant
with
a
gold
ring
on
his
finger
chance
revealed
to
him
that
this
ring
rendered
its
wearer
invisible
he
set
out
for
the
court
in
quest
of
adventures
seduced
the
queen
murdered
the
king
and
seized
his
crown
accomplishing
all
this
by
virtue
of
his
talisman
this
version
is
curious
because
it
has
preserved
for
us
one
of
the
earliest
examples
of
a
ring
which
renders
its
wearer
invisible
it
is
well
known
how
frequently
such
a
talisman
appears
in
oriental
tales
of
a
later
period
according
to
a
third
legend
his
crime
and
exaltation
had
been
presaged
by
a
wondrous
prodigy
two
eagles
of
supernatural
size
had
alighted
on
the
roof
of
room
while
she
was
still
dwelling
in
her
house
and
the
soothsayers
who
were
consulted
prognosticated
that
the
princess
would
be
the
wife
of
two
kings
in
a
single
night
and
in
fact
gyges
having
stabbed
sadyattes
when
his
marriage
was
but
just
consummated
forced
toudô
to
become
his
wife
on
the
spot
without
waiting
for
the
morrow
other
stories
were
current
in
which
the
events
were
related
with
less
of
the
miraculous
element
and
which
attributed
the
success
of
gyges
to
the
unbounded
fidelity
shown
him
by
the
carian
arselis
in
whatever
manner
it
was
brought
about
his
accession
marked
the
opening
of
a
new
era
for
lydia
the
country
had
always
been
noted
for
its
valiant
and
warlike
inhabitants
but
the
heraclidse
had
not
expended
its
abundant
resources
on
foreign
conquest
and
none
of
the
surrounding
peoples
suspected
that
it
could
again
become
the
seat
of
a
brilliant
empire

subjects
if
he
were
not
actually
the

to
organise

admirable
cavalry
corps
which
for
nearly
a
century
proved
itself
invincible
on

it

he

chronologists

period
these
latter
made
the
fall
of
the
phrygian
kingdom
coincide
with
the
reign
of
amon
in
judæa
and
this
date
is
accepted
by
most
modern
historians
one
fact
alone
probably
taken
from
the
lydiaca
of
xanthus
is
known
to
us
concerning
their
operations
in
phrygia
namely
the
taking
of
syassos
and
the
capture
of
enormous
stores
of
corn
which
were
laid
up
in
the
silos
in
that
city
gyges
resolutely
held
his
own
and
successfully
repulsed
them
but
the
struggle
was
too
unequal
between
their
vast
hordes
recruited
incessantly
from
their
reserves
in
thrace
or
the
caucasus
and
his
scanty
battalions
of
lydians
carians
and
creeks
unaided
he
had
no
chance
of
reopening
the
great
royal
highway
which
the
fall
of
the
phrygian
monarchy
had
laid
at
the
mercy
of
the
barbarians
along
the
whole
of
its
middle
course
and
yet
he
was
aware
that
a
cessation
of
the
traffic
which
passed
between
the
euphrates
and
the
hermos
was
likely
to
lead
in
a
short
time
to
the
decay
of
his
kingdom
if
the
numerous
merchants
who
were
wont
to
follow
this
ancient
traditional
route
were
once
allowed
to
desert
it
and
turn
aside
to
one
of
the
which
might
replace
it
either
that
of
the
pontus
in
the
north
or
of
the
mediterranean
in
the
south
they
might
not
be
willing
to
return
to
it
even
when
again
opened
to
traffic
and
lydia
would
lose
for
ever
one
of
her
richest
sources
of
revenue
radet
deserves
credit
for
being
the
first
to
point
out
the
economic
reasons
which
necessarily
led
gyges
to
make
his
attempt
at
forming
an
alliance
with
he
has
thus
definitely
dismissed
the
objections
which
some
recent
critics
had
raised
against
the
authenticity
of
this
episode
in
order
to
defend
classic
tradition
and
diminish
the
authority
of
the
assyrian
texts
we
may
well
conceive
that
gyges
whose
fortune
and
very
existence
was
thus
in
jeopardy
would
seek
assistance
against
these
barbarians
from
the
sovereign
whose
interests
appeared
identical
with
his
own
the
renown
of
the
assyrian
empire
had
penetrated
far
into
the
west
the
achæns
of

who
were
its
subjects
the
greek
colonists
of
cilicia
and
the
soldiers
whom
the
exigencies
of

brought

must
all
have
testified
to
its
splendour
and
the
fame
of
its
conquests
over
the
tabal
and
the
peoples
on
the
halys
had
spread
abroad
more
than
once
during
the
previous
century
and
had
reached
as
far
as
the
western
extremity
of
the
peninsula
of

by
means
of
the
merchants
of

or

continued
to
be
a
source
of
anxiety
to
her
rulers
gyges
judged
that
participation
in
a
common
hatred
or
danger
would
predispose
the
king
in
his
favour
and
a
dream
furnished
him
with
a
pretext
for
notifying
to
the
court
of
nineveh
his
desire
to
enter
into
friendly
relations
with
it
he
dreamed
that
a
god
undoubtedly
assur
had
appeared
to
him
in
the
night
and
commanded
him
to
prostrate
himself
at
the
feet
of
his
name
thou
shalt
overcome
thine
the
next
morning
he
despatched
horsemen
to
the
great
king
but
when
the
leader
of
the
embassy
reached
the
frontier
and
met
the
assyrians
for
the
first
time
they
asked
him
then
art
thou
brother
thou
from
whose
land
no
courier
has
as
yet
visited
our
country
the
language
he
spoke
was
unknown
to
them
they
only
gathered
that
he
desired
to
be
conducted
into
the
presence
of
the
king
and
consequently
sent
him
on
to
nineveh
under
good
escort
there
the
same
obstacle
presented
itself
for
none
of
the
official
interpreters
at
the
court
knew
the
lydian
tongue
however
an
interpreter
was
at
length
discovered
who
translated
the
story
of
the
dream
as
best
he
could
joyfully
accepted
the
homage
offered
to
him
from
such
a
land
and
from
thenceforward
some
sort
of
alliance
existed
between
assyria
and
lydia
an
alliance
of
a
very
platonic
order
from
which
gyges
at
least
derived
no
sensible
advantage
some
troops
sent
into
the
country
of
the
white
syrians
may
have
disquieted
the
cimmerians
and
by
causing
a
diversion
in
their
rear
procured
a
respite
for
lydia
but
the
caravan
route
across
asia
minor
was
only
of
secondary
importance
to
the
prosperity
of
nineveh
and
the
syrian
provinces
since
the
phoenician
navy
provided
sufficient
outlets
for
their
trade
in
the
west
lavished
friendly
speeches
on
the
lydians
but
left
them
to
bear
the
brunt
of
the
attack
alone
and
devoutly
thanked
assur
for
the
security
which
their
determined
courage
procured
for
the
western
frontier
of
his
empire
the
cimmerian
peril
being
for
the
present
at

averted

no
longer

of

fierce
and
turbulent
disposition

endeavoured
to
conciliate
the
good

provisions
of
all
sorts
during
a
famine
which
had
afflicted
the
country

his
good
will

he
refused
to
bring
into
servitude
those
elamite
subjects
who
had
taken
refuge
with
their
families
on
assyrian
territory
to
escape
the
scourge
although
the
rights
of
nations
authorised
him
so
to
do
but
having
nourished
them
as
long
as
the
dearth
lasted
he
then
sent
them
back
to
their
urtaku

thenceforward
maintained

of

doubtless
the
population
of
assyria
proper
and
the
ancient
districts
whose
contingents
formed
the
nucleus
of
the
army
were
still
suffering
from
the
results
of
the
civil
war
which
had
broken
out
more
than
fifteen
years
before
after
the
assassination
of
sennacherib

under
the
easy
rule
of
esarhaddon
the
natural
increase
of
population
unchecked
by
any
extraordinary
call
for
recruits
must
have
almost
repaired
their
losses
the
egyptian
campaigns
partially
carried
out
by
syrian
auxiliaries
had
not
sensibly
retarded
this
progress
and
provided
that
peace
were
maintained
for
some
years
longer
the
time
seemed
at
hand
when
the
king
having
repaired
his
losses
could
call
upon
the
nation
to
make
fresh
efforts
in
offensive
or
defensive
warfare
without
the
risk
of
seeing
his
people
melt
and
disappear
before
his
eyes
it
seems
indeed
as
if
either
by
policy
or
natural
disposition
was
inclined
for
peace
but
this
did
not
preclude
when
occasion
demanded
his
directing
his
forces
and
fighting
in
person
like
any
other
assyrian
monarch
he
however
preferred
repose
and
when
circumstances
forced
war
upon
him
he
willingly
delegated
the
conduct
of
the
army
to
his
generals
he
would
probably
have
renounced
possession
of
egypt
if
he
could
have
done
so
with
safety
and
such
a
course
would
not
have
been
without
wisdom
the
retention
of
this
newly
acquired
province
being
difficult
and
costly
not
to
speak
of
differences
in
language
religion
and
manners
which
would
prevent
it
from
ever
becoming
assimilated
to
assyria
as
damascus
hamath
and
samaria
and
most
of
the
asiatic
states
had
been
it
was
merely
connected
with
the
rest
of
the
empire
by
the
thin
chain
of
rocks
desert
and
marshes
stretching
between
the
red
sea
and
the
mediterranean
a
revolt
of
the
cities
of
the
philistines
or
of
one
of
the
idumsean
sheikhs
would
have
sufficed
to
isolate
it
and
communications
once
interrupted
the
safety
of
the
numerous
assyrian
officers
and
garrisons
would
be
seriously
jeopardised
all
of
whom
must
be
maintained
there
if
the
country
was
to
be
permanently
retained
the
inclination
to
meddle
in
the
affairs
of
syria
always
displayed
by
the
pharaohs
and
their
obsolete
claims
to
rule
the
whole
country
as
far
as
the
euphrates
did
not
allow
of
their
autonomy
being
restored
to
them
at
the
risk
of
the
immediate
renewal
of
their
intrigues
with
tyre
or
judah
and
the
fomenting
of
serious
rebellions
among
the
vassal
princes
of
palestine
on
the
other
hand
egypt
was
by
its
natural
position
so
detached
from
the
rest
of
the
empire
that
it
was
certain
to
escape
from
the
influence
of
nineveh
as
soon
as
the
pressure
of
circumstances
obliged
the
suzerain
to
relax
his
efforts
to
keep
it
in
subjection

behind

inaccessible

fabled

renew
hostilities
when
the
occasion
offered
montumihâît
had
already
returned
to
thebes
on
the
retreat
of
the
assyrian
battalions
and
though
taharqa
rendered
inactive
as
it
was
said
by
a
dream
which
bade
him
remain
at
napata

not
reappeared

of

had
sent
tanuatamanu
the
son
of
his
wife
by
sabaco
to
administer
the
province

name

shortly
after
and
his
stepson
was
preparing
to
leave
thebes
in
order
to
be
solemnly
crowned
at
gebel

he
saw
one
night
in

dream

serpents

on

thou
those
of
the
north

crowns

he
proceeded
at
once
to
present
himself
before
his
divine
father
amon
of
napata
and
encountering
no
opposition
from
the
ethiopian
priests
or
nobles
he
was
able
to
fulfil
the
prediction
almost
immediately
after
his
coronation
the
legend
quoted
by
herodotus
relates
that
sabaco
having
slain
necho
the
father
of
psammetichus
evacuated
egypt
which
he
had
conquered
and
retired
to
ethiopia
in
obedience
to
a
dream
the
name
of
sabaco
was
very
probably
substituted
for
that
of
taharqa
in
the
tradition
preserved
in
sais
and
memphis
echoes
of
which
reached
the
greek
historian
in
the
middle
of
the
fifth
century
it
appears
from
the
of
the
that
tanuatamanu
was
in
the
thebaid
at
the
time
of
his
accession
to
the
throne
steindorff
thinks
that
tanuatamanu
had
been
officially
associated
with
himself
on
the
throne
by
taharqa
and
schsefer
supposes
that
the
dream
dates
from
the
first
year
of
their
joint
reign
the
presence
of
tanuatamanu
beside
taharqa
in
the
small
theban
temple

of
which
were
published
by
mariette

not
necessarily
prove
that
the
two
kings
reigned
conjointly

may
equally
well
indicate
that
the
one
accomplished

work
commenced

the
other

his

banished

with
the
events
taking
place
on
the

was
for
a
moment
in
doubt
whether
this
incursion
was
merely
a
passing
raid
or
the
opening
of
a
serious
war
but
the
reports

soon
left
no

aggressors
the

therefore
gave
up
the
siege

returned
to
their
own
country
but
their
demeanour
was
still
so
undaunted
that
did
not
cross
the
frontier
in
pursuit
of
them
he
doubtless
fully
expected
that
they
would
soon
return
in
larger
numbers

perhaps
his
fear
would
not
have
proved
unfounded

had

fatal

proved
not

so
to
himself

now
seemed

freely

the
death

it

would
be
renewed

for
the
assyrians

transmission

rarely
taken

urtaku
himself
had
gained
the
throne
by
usurpation

accompanied
by
murder
as
he
had
treated
his
elder
brother
and
the
children
of
the
latter
so
did
his
younger
brother
tammaritu
now
treat
his
sons
tammaritu
was
incarnate
whose
whole
thoughts
were
of
murder
and
rapine
at
least
this
was
the
idea
formed
of
him
by
his
assyrian
contemporaries
who
declared
that
he
desired
to
put
to
death
the
sons
of
his
two
predecessors
out
of
sheer
cruelty
but
we
do
not
need
a
very
vivid
imagination
to
believe
that
these
princes
were
anxious
to
dethrone
him
and
that
in
endeavouring
to
rid
himself
of
them
he
was
merely
forestalling
their
secret
plots
they
escaped
his
murderous
designs
however
and
fled
to
assyria
and
tammaritu
sons
of
uxtaku
and
kuduru
and
parru
sons
of
followed
by
sixty
other
princes
of

blood
together
with
archers
and
servants
forming
in
fact
a
small
army
of
elamites
received
them
with
honour
for
their
defection
furnished
him
with
a
powerful
weapon
against
the
usurper
by
succouring
them
he
could
rouse
half
elam
and
involve
it
in
civil
war
in
which
the
pretenders
would
soon
exhaust
their
resources
it
was
now
a
favourable
moment
to
renew
hostilities
in
egypt
while
tammaritu
still
insecure
on
his
throne
would
not
venture
to
provoke
a
conflict
the
time
of
the
war
against
urtaku
and
the
expedition
against
tanuatamanu
is
indicated
by
a
passage
in
a
cylinder
as
yet
unedited
there
we
read
that
the
invasion
of
urtaku
took
place
at
the
moment
when
tanuatamanu
ascended
the
throne
these
preliminary
difficulties
with
elam
would
thus
have
coincided
with
the
two
years
which
elapsed
between
the
accession
of
tanuatamanu
and
his
conquest
of
memphis
up
to
the
third
year
mentioned
in
the
berlin
inscription
the
testimony
of
the
egyptian
monuments
would
thus
be
in
almost
complete
accord
with
the
assyrian
documents
on
this
point
as
a
matter
of
fact
tanuatamanu
did
not
risk
the
defence
of
memphis
but
concentrated
his
forces
at
thebes
once
more
the
assyrian
generals
ascended
the
nile
and
after
a
voyage
lasting
six
weeks
at
length
reached
the
suburbs
of
the
great
city
tanuatamanu
had
fled
towards
kipkip
leaving
thebes
at
the
mercy
of
the
invaders
it
was
given
up
to
pillage
its
population
was
carried
off
into
slavery
and
its
temples
and
palaces
were
despoiled
of
their
treasures

for
the
death
of

the

i
the

against

must
have
taken
place
at
the
end
of
the
third
or
beginning
of
the
fourth
year
of
the
reign
of
tanuatamanu

after

now
long
since
become
the
nations
whom
she
had
afflicted
so
sorely
in
the
days
of
her
glory
had
retained
for
her
feelings
of
respect
and
almost
of
awe
the
rumour
of
her
fall
spread
through
the
eastern
world
filled
them
with
astonishment
and
pity
the
hebrews
saw
in
it
the
chastisement
inflicted
by
their
god
on
the
tyrant
who
had
oppressed
their
ancestors
and
their
prophets
used
it
to
impress
upon
the
minds
of
their
contemporaries
the
vanity
of
human
prosperity
half
a
century
later
when
nineveh
menaced
in
her
turn
was
desperately
arming
herself
to
repel
the
barbarians
nahum
the
elkoshite
demanded
of
her
amid
his
fierce
denunciations
whether
she
vaunted
herself
to
be
better
than
city
of
amon
that
was
situate
among
the
rivers
that
had
the
waters
round
about
her
whose
rampart
was
the
sea
and
her
wall
was
of
the
sea
ethiopia
and
egypt
were
her
strength
and
it
was
infinite
put
and
lubim
libya
and
the
nubians
came
to
her
succour
yet
was
she
carried
away
she
went
into
captivity
her
young
children
also
were
dashed
in
pieces
at
the
top
of
all
the
streets
and
they
cast
lots
for
her
honourable
men
and
all
her
great
men
were
bound
in
lord
of
egypt
and
conqueror
of
ethiopia
might
reasonably
consider
himself
invincible
it
would
have
been
well
for
the
princes
who
trembled
at
the
name
of
if
they
had
taken
this
lesson
to
heart
and
had
learned
from
the
downfall
of
what
fate
awaited
them
in
the
event
of
their
daring
to
arouse
the
wrath
of
assyria
by
any
kind
of
intrigue
unfortunately
many
of
them
either
failed
to
see
the
warning
or
refused
to
profit
by
it
the
mannai
had
quickly
recovered
from
the
defeat
inflicted
on
them
by
esarhaddon
and
their
king
akhsheri
in
spite
of
his
advancing
years
believed
that
his
own
energy
and
resources
were
sufficient
to
warrant
him
in
anticipating
a
speedy
revenge
perhaps
a
further
insight
into
the
real
character
of
may
have
induced
him
to
venture
on
hostilities
for
the
contemporaries
had
begun
to
realise
that
beneath
his
apparent
bravery
and
ostentation
he
was
by
nature
indolent
impatient
of
restraint
and
fond
of
ease
and
luxury
when
not
absorbed
in
the
routine
of
the
court
and
the
pleasures
of
the
harem
he
spent
his
leisure
in
hunting
on
the
mesopotamian
plains
or
in
the
extensive
parks
which
had
been
laid
out
by
himself
or
his
predecessors
in
the
vicinity
of
their
summer
palaces
had
become
merely
a
memory
of
the
past
these
animals
had
been
so
persistently
hunted
for
centuries
that
the
species
had
almost
become
extinct
solitary
specimens
only
were
occasionally
met
with
in
remote
parts
of
the
forest
or
in
marshes
the
wild
ass
was
still
to
be
found
in
large
numbers
as
well
as
the
goat
the
ostrich
and
small
game
but
the
lion
was
now
rarely
met
with
and
the
beaters
were
no
longer
sure
of
finding
him
in
his
ancient
haunts
specimens
had
to
be
sought
by
the
royal
gamekeepers
in
the
provinces
and
when
successfully
trapped
were
forthwith
despatched
to
one
or
other
of
the
country
seats
the
beast
was
often
kept
for
several
days
in
a
cage
while
preparations
were
made
for
a
fête
at
which
he
was
destined
to
form
one
of
the
chief
attractions
and
when
the
time
came
he
was
taken
to
the
appointed
place
and
let
loose
the
sovereign
pursued
him
either
in
a
chariot
or
on
horseback
and
did
not
desist
from
the
chase
till
he
had
pierced
his
quarry
with
arrows
or
lance
illustration
a
lion
issuing
from
its
cage
drawn
by
from
a
photograph
taken
from
the
original
in
the
british
museum
frequently
the
beast
would
be
turned
loose
in
the
park
and
left
there
till
accustomed
to
his
surroundings
so
that
later
on
he
might
be
run
down
under
conditions
somewhat
resembling
his
native
freedom
did
not
shun
a
personal
encounter
with
an
infuriated
lion
he
displayed
in
this
hazardous
sport
a
bravery
and
skill
which
rivalled
that
of
his
ancestors
and
he
never
relegated
to
another
the
task
of
leading
the
attack
or
dealing
the
final
this
however
was
not
the
case
when
it
was
a
question
of
starting
on
some
warlike
expedition
he
would
then
leave
to
his
tartans
or
to
the
eabshakeh
or
to
some
other
chosen
officer
the
entire
conduct
of
all
operations
we
have
seen
for
example
that
after
the
death
of
esarhaddon
the
egyptian
campaign
was
conducted
by
one
of
the
tartans
and
the
eabshakeh
this
did
not
preclude
the
king
from
taking
an
interest
in
what
was
passing
beyond
the
frontier
nor
did
he
fail
in
his
performance
of
the
various
religious
duties
which
custom
imposed
on
an
assyrian
sovereign
he
consulted
the
oracles
of
shamash
or
ishtar
he
offered
sacrifices
he
fasted
and
humbled
himself
in
the
temples
to
obtain
the
success
of
his
troops
and
when
they
returned
laden
with
spoil
from
the
campaign
he
attributed
their
victories
no
less
to
his
prayers
than
to
their
courage
or
to
the
skill
of
their
leaders
his
generals
thoroughly
equipped
for
their
task
and
well
supported
by
their
troops
had
no
need
of
the
royal
presence
to
ensure
their
triumph
over
any
foe
they
might
encounter
indeed
in
the
absence
of
the
king
they
experienced
a
liberty
of
action
and
boldness
in
pressing
their
victories
to
the
uttermost
which
they
would
not
have
enjoyed
had
he
been
in
command
foreigners
accustomed
to
see
the
sovereigns
of
nineveh
conduct
their
armies
in
person
as
long
as
they
were
not
incapacitated
by
age
thought
that
the
indolence
of
was
the
unconscious
expression
of
weariness
or
of
his
feeble
control
of
the
empire
and
akhsheri
determined
to
be
one
of
the
first
to
take
advantage
of
it
events
proved
that
he
was
mistaken
in
his
calculations
no
sooner
had
his
intentions
become
known
than
a
division
of
assyrian
troops
appeared
on
his
frontier
and
prepared
to
attack
him
resolving
to
take
the
initiative
he
fell
one
night
unexpectedly
upon
the
assyrian
camp
but
fortune
declared
against
him
he
was
driven
back
and
his
broken
ranks
were
closely
pursued
for
a
distance
of
miles
eight
of
his
strongholds
fell
one
after
the
other
and
he
was
at
length
forced
to
abandon
his
capital
of
izirtu
and
flee
precipitately
to
his
fortress
of
adrana
in
the
heart
of
the
mountains
even
there
he
did
not
find
the
security
he
desired
for
the
conqueror
pursued
him
thither
methodically
devastating
by
the
way
the
districts
through
which
he
passed
he
carried
off
everything
men
slaves
and
herds
of
cattle
and
he
never
retired
from
a
city
or
village
without
previously
setting
it
on
fire
paddir
arsiyanîsh
and
eristiana
were
thus
laid
waste
after
which
the
assyrians
returned
to
their
camp
having
the
authority
of
their
master
over
several
districts
which
had
been
lost
to
them
for
some
generations
previously
akhsheri
had
shown
no
sign
of
yielding
but
his
people
weary
of
a
hopeless
resistance
put
him
to
death
and
hurling
his
corpse
over
the
wall
of
adrana
proclaimed
his
son
ualli
as
king
the
new
sovereign
hastened
to
conclude
a
treaty
with
the
assyrians
on
reasonable
terms
he
gave
up
his
eldest
son
erisinni
and
one
of
his
daughters
as
hostages
and
promised
to
pay
the
former
tribute
augmented
by
an
annual
present
of
thirty
horses
peace
was
not
again
disturbed
on
this
side
except
by
some
unimportant
skirmishes
in
one
of
these
a
median
chieftain
named
made
an
alliance
with
two
princes
of
the
people
of
the
sakhi
sarâti
and
parikhia
sons
of
gâgu
to
ravage
the
marches
of
the
greater
zab
but
their
territory
was
raided
in
return
and
they
themselves
taken
prisoners
the
name
of
has
an
iranian
appearance
the
first
element
recalls
the
zend
large
the
second
which
appears
in
the
names
khadir
and
is
of
uncertain
derivation
and
has
been
connected
with
or
with
gâgu
which
is
found
as
the
name
of
a
people
gagâti
in
the
tablets
has
been
identified
from
the
first
with
the
name
of
gog
prince
of
rosh
meshech
and
tubal
ezek
xxxviii
xxxix
the
name
of
the
country
of
sakhi
which
has
not
been
met
with
elsewhere
has
been
compared
with
that
of
the
sacaj
which
seems
to
have
existed
not
only
in
the
name
of
the
province
of
sakascnô
mentioned
by
the
classical
geographers
but
in
that
of
shake
known
to
the
old
armenian
geographers
the
country
itself
however
as
it
seems
to
me
can
not
be
sought
in
the
direction
of
sakasenô
and
consequently
the
proposed
identification
can
not
hold
good
a
little
later
andaria
prince
of
lubdi
forgetful
of
his
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
aged
made
a
night
attack
on
the
towns
of
kullimir
and
ubbumî
the
inhabitants
armed
in
haste
and
he
was
not
only
defeated
but
was
taken
captive
and
his
head
cut
off
to
be
sent
to
nineveh
the
garrisons
and
military
colonies
along
the
frontier
were
constantly
required
to
be
on
the
alert
but
they
usually
had
sufficient
available
resources
to
meet
any
emergency
and
the
enemies
who
molested
them
were
rarely
dangerous
enough
to
necessitate
the
mobilisation
of
a
regular
army
this
was
not
the
case
however
in
the
where
tiummân
counting
on
the
military
strength
of
elam
made
continual
hostile
demonstrations
he
was
scarcely
settled
on
his
throne
before
he
hastened
to
form
alliances
with
those
aramæan
states
which
had
so
often
invoked
the
aid
of
his
predecessors
against
the
ancestors
of
the
kaldâ
rejected
his
proposals
as
did
most
of
the
tribes
of
the
littoral
but
the
gambulâ
yielded
to
his
solicitations
and
their
king
dunânu
son
of
entered
into
an
offensive
and
defensive
alliance
with
elam
their
defection
left
the
eastern
frontier
of
karduniash
unprotected
and
by
opening
to
the
elamite
the
fords
of
the
tigris
permitted
him
to
advance
on
babylon
unhindered
by
any
serious
obstacle
as
soon
as
the
compact
was
sealed
tiummân
massed
his
battalions
on
the
middle
course
of
the
uknu
and
before
crossing
the
frontier
sent
two
of
his
generals
the
susian
and
the
chaldean
as
the
bearers
of
an
insolent
ultimatum
to
the
court
of
nineveh
he
offered
the
king
the
choice
between
immediate
hostilities
or
the
extradition
of
the
sons
of
urtaku
and
as
well
as
of
their
partisans
who
had
taken
refuge
in
assyria
to
surrender
the
exiles
would
have
been
an
open
confession
of
inferiority
and
such
a
humiliating
acknowledgment
of
weakness
promptly
reported
throughout
the
eastern
world
might
shortly
have
excited
a
general
revolt
hence
disdainfully
rejected
the
proposal
of
the
elamite
sovereign
which
had
been
made
rather
as
a
matter
of
form
than
with
any
hope
of
its
acceptance
but
the
issue
of
a
serious
war
with
susa
was
so
uncertain
that
his
refusal
was
accompanied
with
serious
misgivings
it
needed
many
favourable
omens
from
the
gods
to
encourage
him
to
believe
in
his
future
success
the
sin
was
the
first
to
utter
his
prediction
he
suffered
eclipse
in
the
month
of
tammuz
and
for
three
successive
days
at
nightfall
showed
himself
in
the
sky
surrounded
by
strange
appearances
which
heralded
the
death
of
a
king
in
elam
and
foretold
calamity
to
that
country
then
assur
and
ishtar
struck
tiummân
with
violent
convulsions
they
caused
his
lips
and
eyes
to
be
horribly
distorted
but
he
despised
their
warning
and
as
soon
as
his
seizure
had
passed
set
out
to
assume
command
of
his
army
the
news
of
his
action
reached
nineveh
in
the
month
of
ab
on
the
morning
of
the
solemn
festival
of
ishtar
was
at
arbela
celebrating
the
rites
in
honour
of
the
goddess
when
the
messenger
appeared
before
him
and
repeated
together
with
the
terms
of
the
declaration
of
war
the
scornful
words
which
tiummân
had
uttered
against
him
and
his
patroness
prince
whose
wits
have
been
crazed
by
ishtar
i
will
let
him
escape
no
more
when
once
i
have
gone
forth
and
measured
my
strength
against
him
this
blasphemy
filled
the
assyrian
king
with
horror
that
very
evening
he
betook
himself
to
the
sanctuary
and
there
prostrate
before
the
image
of
the
goddess
he
poured
forth
prayers
mingled
with
tears
of
arbela
i
am
king
of
assyria
the
creature
of
thy
hands
the
offspring
of
a
father
whom
thou
didst
create
behold
now
this
tiummân
the
king
of
elam
who
despises
the
gods
of
assyria
hath
sent
forth
his
host
and
prepared
himself
for
the
conflict
he
hath
called
for
his
arms
to
rush
to
attack
assyria
do
thou
o
archer
of
the
gods
like
a
bolt
falling
in
the
midst
of
the
battle
overthrow
him
and
let
loose
upon
him
a
tempest
and
an
evil
wind
ishtar
heard
his
prayer
and
her
voice
sounded
through
the
gloom
not
said
she
comforting
him
thou
hast
raised
thy
hands
to
me
in
supplication
and
thine
eyes
are
bedewed
with
tears
grant
thee
a
boon
towards
the
end
of
that
night
a
seer
slept
in
the
temple
and
was
visited
by
a
dream
ishtar
of
arbela
appeared
to
him
with
a
quiver
on
either
side
a
bow
in
one
hand
and
a
drawn
sword
in
the
other
she
advanced
towards
the
king
and
spoke
to
him
as
if
she
had
been
his
mother
war
boldly
whichever
way
thou
turnest
thy
countenance
there
will
i
go
and
the
king
replied
to
her
thou
goest
will
i
go
with
thee
sovereign
lady
but
she
answered
thou
here
dwell
in
this
home
of
nebo
eat
thy
food
and
drink
thy
wine
listen

at
the
point
on

frontier
nearest
to

tiummân
was
not
expecting
such
a
prompt

attack
he
had
reckoned
doubtless
on
uniting
his
forces
with
those
of
dunânu
with
a
view
to
invading
karduniash
and
suddenly
realised
that
his
adversary
had
forestalled
him
and
was
advancing
on
the
heart
of
his
empire
he
slowly
withdrew
his
advanced
guard

concentrated
his
forces
round
the
town
of

on

considers
and
with
reason
i
think
that
the
battle
took
place
to
the
south
of
susa
on
the
river
shavur
which
would
correspond
to
the
ulaî
on
the
lowest
spurs
of
the
ridge
of
hills
bordering
the
alluvial
plain
of

his
position
was
a
strong
one
flanked
on
the
right
by
a
wood
and
on
the
left
by
the
ulaî
while
the
flower
of
the
elamite
nobility
was
ranged
around
him
the
equipment
of
his
soldiers
was
simpler
than
that
of
the
enemy
consisting
of
a
low
helmet
devoid
of
any
crest
but
furnished
with
a
large
pendant
tress
of
horsehair
to
shade
the
neck
a
shield
of
moderate
dimensions
a
small
bow
which
however
was
quite
as
deadly
a
weapon
as
that
of
the
assyrians
when
wielded
by
skilful
hands
a
lance
a
mace
and
a
dagger
he
had
only
a
small
body
of
cavalry
but
the
chariotry
formed
an
important
force
and
presented
several
original
features
the
chariot
did
not
follow
the
classic
model
rounded
in
front
and
open
at
the
back
it
was
a
kind
of
light
car
consisting
of
a
square
footboard
placed
flat
on
the
axle
of
the
wheels
and
furnished
with
triangular
on
two
sides
only
the
vehicle
being
drawn
by
a
pair
of
horses
such
chariots
were
easier
to
manage
better
adapted
for
rapid
motion
and
must
have
been
more
convenient
for
a
reconnaissance
or
for
skirmishes
with
infantry
but
when
thrown
in
a
mass
against
the
heavy
chariotry
of
the
peoples
of
the
euphrates
they
were
far
too
slightly
built
to
overthrow
the
latter
and
at
close
quarters
were
of
necessity
crushed
by
the
superior
weight
of
the
adversary

had
often

had
more

at

victoriously
repelled

never
till
now
had
an
assyrian
army
gained
such
an
important
victory
over
elam
and
though
it
was
by
no
means
decisive
we
can
easily
believe
that
was
filled
with
pride
and
delight
since
it
was
the
first
time
that
a
king
of
nineveh
had
imposed
on
elam
a
sovereign
of
his
own
choice
since
homage
was
voluntarily
rendered
him
by
the
rulers
of
foreign
nations
doubtless
believed
that
he
might
exact
it
without
hesitation
from
the
vassal
princes
dependent
on
the
empire
and
not
from
the
weaker

like
those
who
were

be

also
from
the
more
powerful
not
excepting
the
lord
of
karduniash
had
fully
risen
to
his
position
as
king
of
babylon
and
the
unbroken
peace
which
he
had
enjoyed
since
the
death
of
urtaku
had
enabled
him
almost
to
complete
the
restoration
of
the
kingdom
begun
under
esarhaddon
he
had
finished
the
rebuilding
of
the
walls
of
babylon
and
had
fortified
the
approaches
to
the
city
thus
rendering
it
capable
of
withstanding
a
long
siege
he
had
repaired
the
temple
of
sippara
which
had
never
recovered
from
the
elamite
invasion
and
while
unstintingly
lavishing
his
treasures
in
honour
of
the
gods
and
for
the
safety
of
his
capital
he
watched
with
jealous
care
over
the
interests
of
his
subjects
he
obtained
for
them
the
privilege
of
being
treated
on
the
same
footing
as
the
assyrians
throughout
his
ancestral
domains
they
consequently
enjoyed
the
right
of
trading
without
restriction
throughout
the
empire
and
met
with
the
same
degree
of
protection
from
the
officials
of
nineveh
as
from
the
magistrates
of
their
own
country
had
at
the
outset
furthered
the
wishes
of
his
brother
to
the
utmost
of
his
power
he
had
granted
the
privileges
demanded
and
whenever
a
chaldæan
of
noble
birth
arrived
at
his
court
he
received
him
with
special
marks
of
favour
the
two
states
enjoyed
a
nearly
absolute
equality
during
the
opening
years
of
his
reign
and
though
the
will
of
esarhaddon
had
made
babylon
dependent
on
assyria
the
yoke
of
vassalage
was
far
from
heavy
the
suzerain
reserved
to
himself
the
honour
of
dedicating
the
mighty
works
begun
by
his
father
the
restoration
of
the
temple
of
and
of
the
double
wall
of
fortification
he
claimed
in
his
inscriptions
the
whole
merit
of
the
work
but
he
none
the
less
respected
his
rights
and
in
no
way
interfered
in
the
affairs
of
the
city
except
in
state
ceremonies
in
which
the
assertion
of
his
superior
rank
was
indispensable
but
with
success
his
moderation
gradually
gave
place
to
arrogance
in
proportion
as
his
military
renown
increased
he
accentuated
his
supremacy
and
accustomed
himself
to
treat
babylon
more
and
more
as
a
vassal
state
after
the
conquest
of
elam
his
infatuated
pride
knew
no
bounds
and
the
little
consideration
he
still
retained
for
vanished
completely
he
thenceforward
refused
to
regard
him
as
being
more
than
a
prefect
bearing
a
somewhat
higher
title
than
his
fellows
a
viceroy
owing
his
crown
not
to
the
will
of
their
common
father
but
to
the
friendship
of
his
brother
and
liable
to
be
deprived
of
it
at
any
moment
through
the
caprice
of
the
sovereign
he
affected
to
consider
all
that
took
place
at
babylon
as
his
own
doing
and
his
brother
as
being
merely
his
docile
instrument
not
deserving
mention
any
more
than
the
ordinary
agents
who
carried
out
his
designs
and
if
indeed
he
condescended
to
mention
him
it
was
with
an
assumption
of
disdainful
superiority
it
is
a
question
whether
at
this
juncture
believed
that
his
brother
was
meditating
a
design
to
snatch
the
reins
of
government
from
his
hand
or
whether
he
merely
yielded
to
the
impulse
of
wounded
vanity
in
resolving
to
shake
off
a
yoke
which
had
become
intolerable
knowing
that
his
power
was
not
equal
to
that
of
he
sought
to
enter
into
relations
with
foreign
allies
who
shared
the
same
fears
or
nursed
a
similar
feeling
of
bitterness
the
nobles
and
priests
of
the
ancient
sumerian
and
accadian
cities
were
already
on
his
side
but
the
aramaeans
had
shown
themselves
hostile
at
his
accession
and
had
brought
down
on
him
the
forces
of
elam
he
found
means
however
to
conciliate
them
together
with
the
tribes
which
dwelt
on
the
tigris
and
the
uknu
as
well
as
those
of
the
lower
euphrates
and
the
arabian
desert
he
won
over
to
his
projects
the
chief
of
the
kaldâ
grandson
of
that
who
had
cherished
invincible
hatred
against
sargon
and
sennacherib
besides
the
lords
of
the
and
and
the
sheikh
of
the
pukudu
ought
to
have
remained
loyal
to
the
friend
to
whom
he
owed
his
kingdom
but
he
chafed
at
the
patronage
of
assyria
and
had
just
formulated
a
demand
to
which
he
not
unreasonably
hesitated
to
accede
the
archaic
statue
of
nana
stolen
from
uruk
by
sixteen
centuries
before
and
placed
by
that
prince
in
one
of
the
temples
of
susa
had
become
so
naturalised
in
its
new
abode
that
the
kings
of
elam
not
content
with
rendering
it
an
official
cult
were
wont
to
send
presents
to
babylonia
to
the
image
which
had
replaced
it
in
its
original
sanctuary
now
required
to
give
back
the
original
statue
but
the
elamite
could
not
obey
this
mandate
without
imperilling
both
his
throne
and
his
person
he
would
thereby
have
risked
incurring
the
displeasure
both
of
the
nobles
whose
pride
would
have
suffered
at
the
loss
of
so
precious
a
trophy
and
of
the
common
people
who
would
have
thus
been
deprived
of
one
of
their
most
venerable
objects
of
devotion
the
messengers
of
arriving
at
the
moment
when
this
question
was
agitating
the
court
of
susa
found
the
way
already
prepared
for
a
mutual
understanding
besides
they
held
in
their
hands
an
irresistible
argument
the
treasures
of
of
babylon
of
nebo
of
borsippa
and
of
nergal
of
kuta
which
had
been
confided
to
them
by
the
priests
with
a
view
to
purchasing
if
necessary
the
support
of
elam
thereupon
promised
to
send
a
detachment
of
troops
to
karduniash
and
to
invade
the
provinces
of
assyria
the
moment
war
should
be
declared
the
tribes
of
guti
were
easily
won
over
and
were
followed
by
the
kings
of
phoenicia
and
the
bedâwin
of
melukhkha
and
perhaps
egypt
itself
was
implicated
in
the
plot
the
prince
of
kedar
amuladdin
undertook
to
effect
a
diversion
on
the
frontiers
of
syria
and
uatê
son
of
layali
one
of
the
arab
kings
who
had
paid
homage
to
esarhaddon
was
not
behindhand
in
furnishing
his
contingent
of
horsemen
and
wild
native
infantry
the
coalition
already
extended
from
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
and
the
red
sea
to
the
persian
gulf
before
became
aware
of
its
existence
an
unforeseen
occurrence
suddenly
broke
in
upon
his
peace
and
revealed
the
extent
of
the
peril
which
threatened
him
the
chronology
of
this
war
has
been
determined
by
smith
from
the
dates
attached
to
the
documents
in
the
british
museum
which
give
the
names
of
three
durnzur
zagabbu
and
these
he
assigned
respectively
to
the
years
and
tiele
has
shown
that
these
three
must
be
assigned
to
the
years
though
these
dates
seem
in
the
highest
degree
probable
we
must
wait
before
we
can
consider
them
as
absolutely
certain
till
chance
restores
to
us
the
missing
parts
of
the
canon
kudur
the
assyrian
prefect
of
uruk
learnt
from
the
governor
of
uru
that
certain
emissaries
of
had
surreptitiously
entered
that
city
and
were
secretly
fomenting
rebellion
among
the
people
himself
had
been
solicited
to
join
the
movement
but
had
absolutely
refused
to
do
so
and
considering
himself
powerless
to
repress
the
disaffection
with
the
few
soldiers
at
his
disposal
he
had
demanded
reinforcements
kudur
first
furnished
him
with
five
hundred
men
of
his
own
troops
and
subsequently
sent
some
battalions
which
were
under
the
command
of
the
governors
of
arrapkha
and
amidi
but
which
were
for
some
unknown
reason
encamped
in
the
neighbourhood
it
would
appear
that
finding
his
projects
interfered
with
by
this
premature
exposure
tried
to
counteract
its
effects
by
protestations
of
friendship
a
special
embassy
was
despatched
to
his
brother
to
renew
the
assurances
of
his
devotion
and
he
thus
gained
the
time
necessary
to
complete
his
armaments
as
soon
as
he
felt
himself
fully
prepared
he
gave
up
further
dissimulation
and
throwing
away
the
mask
proclaimed
himself
independent
of
assyria
while
at
the
same
moment
despatched
his
army
to
the
frontier
and
declared
war
on
his
former
protector
was
touched
to
the
quick
by
what
he
truly
considered
the
ingratitude
of
the
babylonians
for
the
children
of
babylon
i
had
set
them
upon
seats
of
honour
i
had
clothed
them
in
robes
of
many
colours
i
had
placed
rings
of
gold
upon
their
fingers
the
children
of
babylon
had
been
established
in
assyria
and
were
admitted
into
my
presence
but
the
false
brother
he
has
not
observed
my
ordinances
but
has
raised
against
me
the
peoples
of
akkad
the
kaldâ
the
aramaeans
the
peoples
of
the
country
of
the
sea
from
akabah
to
nineveh
was
at
first
in
a
state
of
trepidation
at
this
unexpected
blow
the
sacred
oracles
gave
obscure
replies
and
presaged
evil
four
times
out
of
five
at
last
one
day
a
seer
slept
and
dreamed
a
dream
in
which
he
saw
this
sentence
written
on
the
ground
in
the
temple
of
sin
those
who
are
meditating
evil
against
king
of
assyria
and
who
are
preparing
themselves
to
fight
with
him
i
will
inflict
on
them
a
terrible
death
by
the
swift
sword
by
flinging
them
into
fire
by
famine
and
by
pestilence
will
i
destroy
their
lives
the
courage
of
the
people
being
revived
by
this
prophecy
issued
a
proclamation
to
the
babylonians
in
which
he
denounced
his
treason
and
commanded
them
to
remain
quiet
as
they
valued
their
lives
and
having
done
this
he
boldly
assumed
the
offensive
the
proclamation
is
dated
in
the
eponymous
year
of
duruzur
corresponding
to
the
events
which
immediately
preceded
the
proclamation
ought
very
probably
to
be
assigned
to
the
same
year
the
only
real
danger
came
from
the
side
of
elam
this
state
alone
was
in
a
condition
to
oppose
him
with
as
numerous
and
determined
an
army
as
that
which
he
himself
could
put
into
the
field
if
blam
were
disabled
it
would
be
impossible
for
babylon
to
be
victorious
and
its
fall
would
be
a
mere
question
of
time
the
opening
of
the
campaign
was
a
difficult
matter
having
sold
his
support
dearly
had
at
all
events
spared
no
pains
to
satisfy
his
employer
and
had
furnished
him
with
the
flower
of
his
nobility
comprising
undashi
one
of
the
sons
of
tiumman
zazaz
prefect
of
billatê
parru
chief
of
khilmu
attamîtu
commanding
the
archers
and
nesu
of
his
forces
in
order
to
induce
undashi
to
serve
under
him
he
had
not
hesitated
to
recall
to
his
memory
the
sad
fate
of
tiumman
and
avenge
upon
assyria
the
murder
of
the
father
who
begat
thee
the
two
opposing
forces
continued
to
watch
one
movements
without
any
serious
engagement
taking
place
during
the
greater
part
of
the
year
though
the
assyrians
won
some
slight
advantages
killing
attamîtu
in
a
skirmish
and
sending
his
head
to
nineveh
some
serious
reverses
soon
counterbalanced
these
preliminary
successes
had
arrived
on
the
scene
with
his
aramæan
forces
and
had
compelled
the
troops
engaged
in
the
defence
of
uruk
and
uru
to
lay
down
their
arms
their
leaders
including
himself
had
been
forced
to
renounce
the
supremacy
of
assyria
and
had
been
enrolled
in
the
rebel
ranks
the
official
accounts
say
nothing
of
the
intervention
of
at
this
juncture
but
the
information
furnished
by
k
in
the
british
museum
makes
up
for
their
silence
the
objection
raised
by
tielo
to
the
interpretation
given
by
smith
that
this
passage
can
not
refer
to
assyrian
deserters
falls
to
the
ground
if
one
admits
that
the
assyrian
troops
led
into
elam
at
a
subsequent
period
by
were
none
other
than
the
garrisons
of
the
lower
euphrates
which
were
obliged
to
side
with
the
insurgents
in
the
two
despatches
and
in
the
british
museum
which
refer
to
the
defection
of
are
dated
the
and
abu
in
the
eponymous
year
of
zagabbu
corresponding
to
the
year
as
indicated
by
tiele
with
very
good
reason
operations
seemed
likely
to
be
indefinitely
prolonged
and
anxious
as
to
the
issue
importunately
besought
the
gods
to
intervene
on
his
behalf
when
discords
breaking
out
in
the
royal
family
of
elam
caused
the
scales
of
fortune
once
more
to
turn
in
his
favour
the
energy
with
which
had
entered
on
the
present
struggle
had
not
succeeded
in
effacing
the
disagreeable
impression
left
on
the
minds
of
the
majority
of
his
subjects
by
the
fact
that
he
had
returned
to
his
country
in
the
chariots
of
the
stranger
and
had
been
enthroned
by
the
decree
of
an
assyrian
general
tammaritu
of
khaîdalu
who
had
then
fought
at
his
side
in
the
ranks
of
the
invaders
was
now
one
of
those
who
reproached
him
most
bitterly
for
his
conduct
he
frankly
confessed
that
his
hand
had
cut
off
the
head
of
tiummân
but
denied
that
he
did
so
in
obedience
to
the
hereditary
enemies
of
his
country
he
had
but
avenged
his
personal
injuries
whereas
following
the
promptings
of
ambition
had
kissed
the
ground
at
the
feet
of
a
slave
of
and
had
received
the
crown
as
a
recompense
for
his
baseness
putting
his
rival
to
death
tammaritu
seized
the
throne
and
in
order
to
prove
that
he
was
neither
consciously
nor
unconsciously
an
instrument
of
ninevite
policy
he
at
once
sent
reinforcements
to
the
help
of
babylon
without
exacting
in
return
any
fresh
subsidy
the
assyrians
taking
advantage
of
the
isolated
position
of
had
pressed
forward
one
of
their
divisions
as
far
as
the
districts
on
the
sea
coast
which
they
had
recovered
from
the
power
of
and
had
placed
under
the
administration
of
belibni
a
person
of
high
rank
the
arrival
of
the
elamite
force
was
on
the
point
of
further
compromising
the
situation
and
rekindling
the
flames
of
war
more
fiercely
than
ever
when
a
second
revolution
broke
out
which
shattered
for
ever
the
hopes
of
naturally
looked
upon
this
event
as
the
result
of
his
supplications
and
sacrifices
assur
and
ishtar
in
answer
to
his
entreaties
raised
up
indabigash
one
of
the
most
powerful
feudal
lords
of
the
kingdom
of
susa
and
incited
him
to
revolt
tarnmaritu
fled
to
the
marshes
which
bordered
the
and
seizing
a
vessel
put
out
to
sea
with
his
brothers
his
cousins
seventeen
princes
of
royal
blood
and
faithful
followers
the
ship
driven
by
the
wind
on
to
the
assyrian
shore
foundered
and
the
dethroned
monarch
demoralised
by
would
have
perished
in
the
confusion
had
not
one
of
his
followers
taken
him
on
his
back
and
carried
him
safely
to
land
across
the
mud
belibni
sent
him
prisoner
to
nineveh
with
all
his
suite
and
after
allowing
him
to
humble
himself
before
him
raised
him
from
the
ground
embraced
him
and
assigned
to
him
apartments
in
the
palace
and
a
train
of
attendants
befitting
the
dignity
which
he
had
enjoyed
for
a
short
time
at
susa
indabigash
was
too
fully
occupied
with
his
own
affairs
to
interfere
again
in
the
quarrel
between
the
two
brothers
his
country
disorganised
by
the
successive
shocks
it
had
sustained
had
need
of
repose
for
some
years
at
least
before
the
lists
except
at
a
disadvantage
he
concluded
no
direct
treaty
with
the
assyrian
king
but
he
at
once
withdrew
the
troops
which
had
entered
karduniash
and
abstained
from
all
hostile
demonstrations
against
the
garrisons
of
the
border
provinces
for
the
moment
indeed
this
was
all
that
was
required
of
him
deprived
of
the
support
of
elam
babylon
was
doomed
to
fall
the
aramaeans
deserted
her
cause
and
grandson
of
despairing
of
ever
recovering
the
heritage
of
his
family
withdrew
to
his
haunts
among
the
reed
beds
of
the
uknu
taking
back
with
him
as
hostages
the
assyrians
whom
he
had
forced
to
join
his
army
at
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
however
was
not
disconcerted
he
probably
hoped
that
his
distant
allies
might
yet
effect
a
diversion
in
his
favour
and
thus
oblige
his
brother
to
withdraw
half
of
the
forces
employed
against
him
indeed
after
the
blockade
had
already
begun
a
band
of
arabs
under
the
two
sheikhs
abiyatê
and
aamu
forced
a
way
through
the
besieging
lines
and
entered
the
city
this
was
the
last
succour
which
reached
babylon
from
without
for
many
long
months
all
communication
between
her
citizens
and
the
outer
world
was
completely
cut
off
the
assyrians
laid
waste
the
surrounding
country
with
ruthless
and
systematic
cruelty
burning
the
villages
razing
to
the
ground
isolated
houses
destroying
the
trees
breaking
down
the
dykes
and
filling
up
the
canals
the
year
was
spent
in
useless
skirmishes
the
city
offered
an
energetic
and
obstinate
resistance
and
as
the
walls
were
thick
and
the
garrison
determined
it
would
not
have
succumbed
had
not
the
supply
of
provisions
finally
failed
famine
raged
in
the
city
and
the
inhabitants
devoured
even
their
own
children
while
pestilence
spreading
among
them
mowed
them
down
by
thousands
illustration
the
eastern
world
in
the
reign
of
the
arab
auxiliaries
at
this
juncture
deserted
the
cause
of
the
defenders
and
their
sheikhs
surrendered
to
who
received
and
pardoned
them
but
the
babylonians
themselves
knowing
that
they
could
expect
no
mercy
held
out
some
time
longer
at
length
their
courage
and
their
strength
exhausted
they
rose
against
their
chiefs
whose
ambition
or
patriotic
pride
had
brought
them
to
such
a
pass
and
determined
to
capitulate
on
any
terms
not
wishing
to
fall
alive
into
the
hands
of
his
brother
shut
himself
up
in
his
palace
and
there
immolated
himself
on
a
funeral
pyre
with
his
wives
his
children
his
slaves
and
his
treasures
at
the
moment
when
his
conquerors
were
breaking
down
the
gates
and
penetrating
into
the
palace
precincts
smith
thought
that
the
babylonians
rendered
furious
by
their
sufferings
had
seized
and
burnt
him
to
death
it
is
however
certain
that
killed
himself
according
to
the
eastern
custom
to
escape
the
tortures
which
awaited
him
if
he
fell
alive
into
the
hands
of
his
enemies
the
memory
of
this
event
transferred
by
the
popular
imagination
to
appears
lu
the
concluding
portion
of
the
legendary
history
of
sardanapalus
the
city
presented
a
terrible
spectacle
and
shocked
even
the
assyrians
accustomed
as
they
were
to
horrors
of
this
sort
most
of
the
numerous
victims
to
pestilence
or
famine
lay
about
the
streets
or
in
the
public
squares
a
prey
to
the
dogs
and
swine
such
of
the
inhabitants
and
of
the
soldiery
as
were
comparatively
strong
had
endeavoured
to
escape
into
the
country
and
only
those
remained
who
had
not
sufficient
strength
left
to
drag
themselves
beyond
the
walls
pursued
the
fugitives
and
having
captured
nearly
all
of
them
vented
on
them
the
full
fury
of
his
vengeance
he
caused
the
tongues
of
the
soldiers
to
be
torn
out
and
then
had
them
clubbed
to
death
he
massacred
the
common
folk
in
front
of
the
great
winged
bulls
which
had
already
witnessed
a
similar
butchery
half
a
century
before
under
his
grandfather
sennacherib
the
corpses
of
his
victims
remained
long
unburied
a
prey
to
all
unclean
beasts
and
birds
when
the
executioners
and
the
king
himself
were
weary
of
the
slaughter
the
survivors
were
pardoned
the
remains
of
the
victims
were
collected
and
piled
up
in
specified
places
the
streets
were
cleansed
and
the
temples
purified
by
solemn
lustrations
were
reopened
for
worship
proclaimed
himself
king
in
his
room
he
took
the
hands
of
bel
and
according
to
custom
his
babylonian
subjects
gave
him
a
new
name
that
of

by
which
he
was
henceforth
known
among
them
the
date
of
for
the
taking
of

the
death
of
is
corroborated
by
the
canon

ptolemy

fragments
of
berosus

of
which

or
years
to
the
reign
of
saosdukhm
sammughes
lehmann
points
out
a
document
dated
in
the
xxth
year
of
which
confirms
the
exactitude
of
the
information
furnished
by
the
greek
chronologists
the
canon
of
ptolemy
gives
as
the
successor
of
saosdukhm
a
certain
kinêladan
who
corresponds
to
kandalanu
whose
date
has
been
fixed
by
contemporary
documents
the
identity
of
kinêladan
with
was
known
from
the
greek
chronologists
for
whereas
ptolemy
puts
kinêladan
after
saosdukhm
the
fragments
of
berosus
state
that
the
successor
of
sammughes
was
his
that
is
to
say
sardanapalus
or
this
identification
had
been
proposed
by
smith
who
tried
to
find
the
origin
of
the
form
kinêladan
in
the
name
of
sinidinabal
which
seems
to
be
borne
by
in
k
of
the
british
and
which
is
really
the
name
of
his
elder
brother
it
found
numerous
supporters
as
soon
as
pinches
had
discovered
the
tablets
dated
in
the
reign
of
kandalanu
and
the
majority
of
assyriologists
and
historians
hold
that
kandalanu
and
are
one
and
the
same
person
had
he
been
wise
he
would
have
completed
the
work
begun
by
famine
pestilence
and
the
sword
and
far
from
creating
a
new
babylon
he
would
have
completed
the
destruction
of
the
ancient
city
the
same
religious
veneration
which
had
disarmed
so
many
of
his
predecessors
probably
withheld
him
from
giving
free
rein
to
his
resentment
and
not
daring
to
follow
the
example
of
sennacherib
he
fell
back
on
the
expedient
adopted
by
iii
and
sargon
adhering
to
their
idea
of
two
capitals
for
two
distinct
states
but
endeavouring
to
unite
in
his
own
person
the
two
irreconcilable
sovereignties
of
marduk
and
assur
he
delegated
the
administration
of
babylonian
affairs
to
one
of
his
high
officers
of
state
and
nineveh
with
an
amount
of
spoil
almost
equalling
that
taken
from
egypt
after
the
sack
of
thebes
who
was
in
was
called
at
that
date
prefect
of
akkad
that
is
to
say
of
babylon
he
probably
entered
on
this
office
immediately
after
the
taking
of
the
city
kuta
sippara
and
borsippa
the
vassal
states
of
babylon
which
had
shared
the
misfortune
of
their
mistress
were
like
her
cleared
of
their
ruins
rebuilt
and
repeopled
and
were
placed
under
the
authority
of
such
was
their
inherent
vitality
that
in
the
short
space
of
ten
or
a
dozen
years
they
had
repaired
their
losses
and
reattained
their
wonted
prosperity
soon
no
effect
of
their
disaster
remained
except
an
additional
incentive
for
hating
nineveh
and
a
determination
more
relentless
than
ever
not
to
spare
her
when
the
day
of
her
overthrow
should
come
and
they
should
have
her
in
their
power
it
was
impossible
for
so
violent
and
so
prolonged
a
crisis
to
take
place
without
in
some
degree
injuring
the
prestige
of
the
empire
subjects
and
allies
of
long
standing
remained
loyal
but
those
only
recently
subjugated
by
conquest
as
well
as
the
neighbouring
independent
kingdoms
without
hesitation
threw
off
the
yoke
of
suzerainty
or
of
obligatory
friendship
under
which
they
had
chafed
egypt
freed
herself
from
foreign
domination
as
soon
as
the
possibilities
of
war
with
elam
had
shown
themselves
and
it
was
psammetichus
of
sais
son
of
necho
one
of
the
princes
most
favoured
by
the
court
of
nineveh
who
set
on
foot
this
campaign
against
his
former
patron
he
expelled
the
assyrian
garrisons
reduced
the
petty
native
princes
to
submission
and
once
more
set
up
the
kingdom
of
the
pharaohs
from
elephantine
to
the
syrian
desert
without
having
been
able
to
spare
a
single
soldier
to
prevent
him
or
to
bring
him
back
to
a
sense
of
his
duty
the
details
of
his
proceedings
are
unknown
to
us
we
learn
only
that
he
owed
his
success
to
mercenaries
imported
from
asia
minor
and
the
assyrian
chroniclers
unaccustomed
to
discriminate
between
the
different
peoples
dwelling
on
the
shores
of
the
ægean
believed
that
these
auxiliaries
were
supplied
to
the
pharaoh
by
the
only
sovereign
with
whom
they
had
had
any
dealings
namely
gyges
king
of
lydia
that
gyges
had
had
negotiations
with
psammetichus
and
procured
assistance
for
him
has
not
yet
been
proved
but
to
assert
that
he
was
incapable
of
conceiving
and
executing
such
a
design
is
quite
a
different
matter
on
the
contrary
all
the
information
we
possess
concerning
his
reign
shows
that
he
was
daring
in
his
political
undertakings
and
anxious
to
court
alliances
with
the
most
distant
countries
the
man
who
tried
to
draw
into
a
joint
enterprise
against
the
cimmerians
would
not
have
hesitated
to
ally
himself
with
psammetichus
if
he
hoped
to
gain
the
least
profit
from
so
doing
constant
intercourse
by
sea
took
place
between
ionia
or
caria
and
egypt
and
no
event
of
any
importance
could
occur
in
the
delta
without
being
promptly
reported
in
ephesus
or
miletus
before
this
time
the
heraclid
rulers
of
sardes
had
lived
on
excellent
terms
with
most
of
the
æolian
or
ionian
colonies
during
the
anxious
years
which
followed
his
accession
gyges
went
still
further
and
entered
into
direct
relations
with
the
nations
of
greece
itself
it
was
no
longer
to
the
gods
of
asia
to
zeus
of
telmissos
that
he
addressed
himself
in
order
to
legitimatise
his
new
sovereignty
but
like
midas
of
phrygia
he
applied
to
the
prophetic
god
of
hellas
to
the
delphian
apollo
and
his
priests
illustration
psammetichus
i
drawn
by
boudier
from
a
photograph
he
recompensed
them
lavishly
for
pronouncing
judgment
in
his
favour
beside
the
silver
offerings
with
which
he
endowed
the
temple
at
delphi
he
presented
to
it
a
number
of
golden
vases
and
among
others
six
craters
weighing
thirty
talents
each
which
placed
by
the
side
of
the
throne
of
midas
were
still
objects
of
admiration
in
the
treasury
of
the
corinthians
in
the
time
of
herodotus
to
these
he
added
at
various
times
such
valuable
gifts
that
the
pythian
priestess
who
had
hitherto
been
poor
was
in
later
times
accounted
to
have
owed
to
him
her
wealth
having
made
sure
of
the
good
will
of
the
immortals
gyges
endeavoured
to
extend
his
influence
among
the
greek
colonies
along
the
coast
and
if
he
did
not
in
every
case
gain
a
footing
amongst
them
his
failure
seems
to
have
been
due
not
to
his
incapacity
but
to
the
force
of
circumstances
or
to
the
ambiguous
position
which
he
happened
to
occupy
with
regard
to
these
colonies
ambition
naturally
incited
him
to
annex
them
and
make
them
into
lydian
cities
but
the
bold
disposition
of
their
inhabitants
and
their
impatience
of
constraint
never
allowed
any
foreign
rule
to
be
established
over
them
conquest
to
be
permanent
would
have
to
be
preceded
by
a
long
period
of
alliance
on
equal
terms
and
of
discreet
patronage
which
might
insensibly
accustom
them
to
recognise
in
their
former
friend
first
a
protector
and
then
a
suzerain
imbued
with
respect
for
their
laws
and
constitution
gyges
endeavoured
to
conciliate
them
severally
and
to
attach
them
to
himself
by
treaties
favourable
to
their
interests
or
flattering
to
their
vanity
and
by
timely
and
generous
assistance
in
their
internecine
quarrels
and
thus
secretly
fostering
their
mutual
jealousies
he
was
able
to
reduce
some
by
force
of
arms
without
causing
too
much
offence
to
the
rest
he
took
colophon
and
also
after
several
fruitless
campaigns
the
magnesia
which
lay
near
sardes
magnesia
of
sipylos
tradition
subsequently
adorning
this
fortunate
episode
in
his
history
with
various
amusing
anecdotes
according
to
one
account
he
had
a
favourite
in
a
youth
of
marvellous
beauty
called
magnes
whom
the
magnesians
as
an
act
of
defiance
to
gryges
had
mutilated
till
he
was
past
recognition
and
it
was
related
that
the
king
appealed
to
the
fortune
of
war
to
avenge
the
affront
by
a
bold
stroke
he
seized
the
lower
quarters
of
smyrna
but
was
unable
to
take
the
citadel
and
while
engaged
in
the
struggle
with
this
city
he
entered
into
a
friendly
understanding
with
ephesus
and
miletus
herodotus
mentions
this
war
without
entering
into
any
details
we
know
from
pausanias
that
the
people
of
smyrna
defended
themselves
bravely
and
that
the
poet
mimnermus
composed
an
elegy
on
this
episode
in
their
history
ephesus
situated
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
oayster
was
the
natural
port
of
sardes
the
market
in
which
the
gold
of
lydia
and
the
commodities
imported
from
the
east
by
the
caravans
which
traversed
the
royal
route
might
be
exchanged
for
the
products
of
hellas
and
of
the
countries
of
the
west
visited
by
the
greek
mariners
the
city
was
at
this
time
under
the
control
of
a
family
of
rich
shipowners
of
whom
the
head
was
called
melas
gryges
gave
him
his
daughter
in
marriage
and
by
this
union
gained
free
access
to
the
seaboard
for
himself
and
his
successors
the
reason
for
his
not
pushing
his
advantages
further
in
this
direction
is
not
hard
to
discover
since
the
fall
of
the
kingdom
of
phrygia
had
left
his
eastern
frontier
unprotected
the
attacks
of
the
cimmerians
had
obliged
him
to
concentrate
his
forces
in
the
interior
and
though
he
had
always
successfully
repulsed
them
the
obstinacy
with
which
these
inroads
were
renewed
year
after
year
prevented
him
from
further
occupying
himself
with
the
greek
cities
he
had
carefully
fortified
his
vast
domains
in
the
basin
of
the
ehyndakos
he
had
reconquered
the
troad
and
though
he
had
been
unable
to
expel
the
barbarians
from
adramyttium
he
prevented
them
from
having
any
inland
communications
miletus
rendered
vigorous
assistance
in
this
work
of
consolidating
his
power
for
she
was
interested
in
maintaining
a
buffer
state
between
herself
and
the
marauders
who
had
already
robbed
her
of
sinope
and
it
was
for
this
reason
that
gyges
after
mercilessly
harassing
her
at
the
beginning
of
his
reign
now
preferred
to
enter
into
an
alliance
with
her
he
had
given
the
milesians
permission
to
establish
colonies
along
the
hellespont
and
the
propontid
at
the
principal
points
where
communication
took
place
between
europe
and
asia
abydos
lampsacus
parium
and
cyzicus
founded
successively
by
milesian
admirals
prevented
the
tribes
which
remained
in
thrace
from
crossing
over
to
reinforce
their
kinsfolk
who
were
devastating
phrygia
gryges
had
hoped
that
his
act
of
deference
would
have
obtained
for
him
the
active
support
of
and
during
the
following
years
he
perseveringly
continued
at
intervals
to
send
envoys
to
nineveh
on
one
occasion
he
despatched
with
the
embassy
two
cimmerian
chiefs
taken
in
battle
and
whom
he
offered
in
token
of
homage
to
the
gods
of
assyria
experience
however
soon
convinced
him
that
his
expectations
were
vain
the
assyrians
far
from
creating
a
diversion
in
his
favour
were
careful
to
avoid
every
undertaking
which
might
draw
the
attention
of
the
barbarians
on
themselves
as
soon
as
gyges
fully
understood
their
policy
he
broke
off
all
connection
with
them
and
thenceforth
relied
on
himself
alone
for
the
protection
of
his
interests
the
disappointment
he
thus
experienced
probably
stirred
up
his
anger
against
assyria
and
if
he
actually
came
to
the
aid
of
psammetichus
the
desire
of
giving
expression
to
a
secret
feeling
of
rancour
no
doubt
contributed
to
his
decision
deeply
resented
this
conduct
but
lydia
was
too
far
off
for
him
to
wreak
his
vengeance
on
it
in
a
direct
manner
and
he
could
only
beseech
the
gods
to
revenge
what
he
was
pleased
to
consider
as
base
ingratitude
he
therefore
prayed
assur
and
ishtar
that
corpse
might
lie
outstretched
before
his
enemies
and
his
bones
be
scattered
far
and
a
certain
tugdami
was
at
that
time
reigning
over
the
cimmerians
and
seems
to
have
given
to
their
hitherto
undisciplined
hordes
some
degree
of
cohesion
and
guidance
he
gathered
under
his
standard
not
only
the
trêres
the
thracian
kinsfolk
of
the
cimmerians
but
some
of
the
asianic
tribes
such
as
the
lycians
who
were
beginning
to
feel
uneasy
at
the
growing
prosperity
of
gyges
and
let
them
loose
upon
their
lydian
quarry
the
name
tugdami
mentioned
in
the
hymn
published
by
strong
has
been
identified
by
sayce
with
the
cimmerian
chief
mentioned
by
strabo
under
the
name
of
lygdamis
the
opinion
of
sayce
has
been
adopted
by
other
assyriologists
the
inscription
makes
tugdami
a
king
of
the
manda
and
thus
overthrows
the
hypothesis
that
lygdamis
or
dygdamis
was
a
lycian
chief
who
managed
to
discipline
the
barbarian
hordes
the
alliance
of
the
lycians
with
the
cimmerians
and
trêres
is
known
from
the
evidence
of
callisthenes
preserved
for
us
by
strabo
it
is
probable
that
many
of
the
marauding
tribes
of
the
taurus
isaurians
lycaonians
and
painphylians
similarly
joined
the
cimmerians
their
heavy
cavalry
with
metal
helmets
and
long
steel
swords
overran
the
peninsula
from
end
to
end
treading
down
everything
under
their
hoofs
gyges
did
his
best
to
stand
up
against
the
storm
but
his
lancers
quailed
beneath
the
shock
and
fled
in
confusion
he
himself
perished
in
the
flight
and
his
corpse
remained
in
the
hands
the
whole
of
lydia
was
mercilessly
ravaged
and
the
lower
town
of
sardes
was
taken
by
storm
strabo
states
definitely
that
it
was
lygdamis
who
took
the
city
the
account
given
by
the
same
author
of
a
double
destruction
of
sardes
in
and
is
due
to
an
unfortunate
borrowing
from
the
work
of
caliisthenes
illustration
battle
of
the
cimmerians
against
the
greeks
accompanied
by
their
dogs
drawn
by
from
the
sarcophagus
of
clazomenæ
ardys
who
had
succeeded
his
father
on
the
throne
was
able
however
to
save
the
citadel
he
rallied
around
him
the
remnants
of
his
army
and
once
more
took
the
field
the
cities
of
ionia
made
common
cause
with
him
their
hoplites
issued
victorious
from
more
than
one
engagement
and
their
dogs
trained
to
harry
fearlessly
the
horses
of
the
enemy
often
took
an
active
part
in
the
battle
city
after
city
was
attacked
by
the
barbarians
and
the
suburbs
plundered
ephesus
on
account
of
the
wealth
it
contained
formed
their
chief
attraction
but
their
forces
dashed
themselves
fruitlessly
against
its
walls
they
avenged
themselves
for
their
failure
by
setting
on
fire
the
temple
of
artemis
which
stood
in
the
outskirts
this
act
of
sacrilege
profoundly
stirred
the
whole
hellenic
world
and
when
the
first
fury
of
pillage
was
exhausted
the
barbarians
themselves
seemed
to
have
been
struck
with
superstitious
horror
at
their
crime
deadly
fevers
contracted
in
the
marshes
near
the
city
thinned
their
ranks
and
in
the
scourge
which
struck
down
their
forces
they
recognised
the
chastisement
of
the
goddess
the
invasion
of
ionia
by
the
cimmerians
is
indicated
in
general
terms
by
herodotus
the
details
of
the
attack
on
ephesus
and
the
destruction
of
the
temple
of
artemis
are
preserved
in
a
passage
of
callimachus
and
in
the
fragments
quoted
by
hesychius
the
survivors
abandoned
the
siege
and
withdrew
in
disorder
towards
the
mountains
of
the
interior
on
their
way
they
surprised
magnesia
on
the
mæander
and
entirely
destroyed
it
but
this
constituted
their
sole
military
success
elsewhere
they
contented
themselves
with
devastating
the
fields
without
venturing
to
attack
the
fortified
towns
scarcely
had
ardys
freed
himself
from
their
unwelcome
presence
than
like
his
father
before
him
he
tried
to
win
the
support
of
assyria
he
sent
an
envoy
to
nineveh
with
a
letter
couched
in
very
humble
terms
king
whom
the
gods
acknowledge
art
thou
for
as
soon
as
thou
hadst
pronounced

i

thy
trembling
servant

my
homage
graciously
and
i
will
bear
thy
yoke
did
not
harden
his
heart
to
this
suppliant
who
confessed
his
fault
so
piteously
and
circumstances
shortly
constrained
him
to
give
a
more
efficacious
proof
of
his
favour
to
ardys
than
he
had
done
in
the
days
of
gyges
on
quitting
lydia
tugdami
with
his
hordes
had
turned
eastwards
bent
upon
renewing
in
the
provinces
of
the
taurus
and
the
euphrates
the
same
destructive
raids
which
he
had
made
among
the
peoples
of
the
ægean
seaboard
but
in
the
gorges
of
cilicia
he
came
into
contact
with
forces
much
superior
to
his
own
and
fell
fighting
against
them
about
the
year
his
son
led
the
survivors
of
this
disaster
back
towards
the
centre
of
the
peninsula
but
the
conflict
had
been
so
sanguinary
that
the
cimmerian
power
never
fully
recovered
from
it
celebrated
the
victory
won
by
his
generals
with
a
solemn
thanksgiving
to
marduk
accompanied
by
substantial
offerings
of
gold
and
objects
of
great
value
strabo
was
aware
perhaps
from
xanthus
of
lyclia
that
lygdamis
had
fallen
in
battle
in
cilicia
the
hymn
to
marduk
published
by
strong
informs
us
that
the
cimmerian
chief
fell
upon
the
assyrians
and
that
his
son
khshatru
carried
on
hostilities
some
time
longer
khshatru
is
an
iranian
name
of
the
same
type
as
that
of
the
median
king
or
cyaxares
the
tranquillity
of
the
frontier
was
thus
for
a
time
secured
and
this
success
most
opportunely
afforded
the
king
leisure
to
turn
his
attention
to
those
of
his
vassals
who
having
thrown
off
their
allegiance
during
the
war
against
had
not
yet
returned
to
their
obedience
among
these
were
the
arabs
and
the
petty
princes
of
egypt
the
contingents
furnished
by
yauta
son
of
hazael
had
behaved
valiantly
during
the
siege
of
babylon
and
when
they
thought
the
end
was
approaching
their
leaders
abiyatê
and
aamu
had
tried
to
cut
a
way
through
the
assyrian
lines
being
repulsed
they
had
laid
down
their
arms
on
condition
of
their
lives
being
spared
there
now
remained
the
bulk
of
the
arab
tribes
to
be
reduced
to
submission
and
the
recent
experiences
of
esarhaddon
had
shown
the
difficulties
attending
this
task
entrusted
its
accomplishment
to
his
subjects
in
edom
moab
ammon
the
haurân
and
damascus
since
dwelling
on
the
very
borders
of
the
desert
they
were
familiar
with
the
routes
and
the
methods
of
warfare
best
suited
to
the
country
they
proved
victorious
all
along
the
line
yauta
betrayed
by
his
own
subjects
took
refuge
with
the
nabatæans
but
their
king
nadanu
although
he
did
not
actually
deliver
him
up
to
the
assyrians
refused
to
grant
him
an
asylum
and
the
unhappy
man
was
finally
obliged
to
surrender
to
his
pursuers
his
cousin
uatê
son
of
birdadda
was
made
chief
in
his
place
by
the
assyrians
and
yauta
was
sent
to
nineveh
where
he
was
exposed
at
one
of
the
city
gates
chained
in
a
niche
beside
the
amuladdin
the
leading
prince
of
kedar
met
with
no
better
fate
he
was
overcome
in
spite
of
the
assistance
rendered
him
by
adîya
the
queen
of
a
neighbouring
tribe
and
was
also
carried
away
into
captivity
his
defeat
completed
the
discouragement
of
the
tribes
who
still
remained
unsubdued
they
implored
mercy
which
granted
to
them
although
he
deposed
most
of
their
sheikhs
and
appointed
as
their
ruler
that
abiyatê
who
had
dwelt
at
his
court
since
the
capitulation
of
babylon
abiyatê
took
the
oath
of
fidelity
and
was
sent
back
to
kedar
where
he
was
proclaimed
king
of
all
the
arab
tribes
under
the
suzerainty
of
assyria
the

to
the
reign
of
whole
series
of
events
comprising
the
first
submission
of
yauta
and
the
restitution
of
the
statues
of
atarsamain
which
had
taken
place
under
esarhaddon
the
assyrian
annalists
do
not
seem
to
have
always
clearly
distinguished
between
yauta
son
of
hazael
and
uatè
son
of
birdadda
of
all
the
countries
which
had
thrown
off
their
allegiance
during
the
late
troubles
egypt
alone
remained
unpunished
and
it
now
seemed
as
if
its
turn
had
come
to
suffer
chastisement
for
its
rebellion
it
was
indeed
not
to
be
tolerated
that
so
rich
and
so
recently
acquired
a
province
should
slip
from
the
grasp
of
the
very
sovereign
who
had
completed
its
conquest
without
his
making
an
effort
on
the
first
opportunity
to
reduce
it
once
more
to
submission
such
inaction
on
his
part
would
be
a
confession
of
impotence
of
which
the
other
vassals
of
the
empire
would
quickly
take
advantage
tyre
judah
moab
the
petty
kings
of
the
taurus
and
the
chiefs
of
media
would
follow
the
example
of
pharaoh
and
the
whole
work
of
the
last
three
centuries
would
have
to
be
done
over
again
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
cherished
the
secret
hope
of
recovering
egypt
in
a
short
campaign
and
that
he
hoped
to
attach
it
to
the
empire
by
more
permanent
bonds
than
before
but
as
a
preliminary
to
executing
this
purpose
it
was
necessary
to
close
and
settle
if
possible
the
account
still
open
against
elam
recent
events
had
left
the
two
rival
powers
in
such
a
position
that
neither
peace
nor
even
a
truce
of
long
duration
could
possibly
exist
between
them
elam
injured
humiliated
and
banished
from
the
plains
of
the
lower
euphrates
over
which
she
had
claimed
at
all
times
an
almost
exclusive
right
of
pillage
was
yet
not
sufficiently
enfeebled
by
her
disasters
to
be
convinced
of
her
decided
inferiority
to
assyria
only
one
portion
of
her
forces
and
that
perhaps
the
smallest
had
taken
the
field
and
sustained
serious
reverses
she
had
still
at
her
disposal
besides
the
peoples
of
the
plain
and
the
marshes
who
had
suffered
the
most
those
almost
inexhaustible
reserves
of
warlike
and
hardy
mountaineers
whose
tribes
were
ranged
on
the
heights
which
bounded
the
horizon
occupying
the
elevated
valleys
of
the
uknu
the
ulaî
and
their
nameless
affluents
on
the
western
or
southern
slopes
or
in
the
enclosed
basins
of
the
iranian
here
elam
had
at
her
command
at
least
as
many
men
as
her
adversaries
could
muster
against
her
and
though
these
barbarian
contingents
lacked
discipline
and
systematic
training
their
bravery
compensated
for
the
imperfection
of
their
military
education
elam
not
only
refused
to
admit
herself
conquered
but
she
believed
herself
sure
of
final
victory
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
not
at
all
certain
that
generals
would
ever
have
completely
triumphed
over
her
if
internal
discords
and
treason
had
not
too
often
paralysed
her
powers
the
partisans
of
were
largely
responsible
for
bringing
about
the
catastrophe
in
which
tiummân
had
perished
and
those
who
sided
with
tammaritu
had
not
feared
to
provoke
a
revolt
at
the
moment
when
was
occupied
in
chaldæa
indabigash
in
his
turn
had
risen
in
rebellion
in
the
rear
of
tammaritu
and
his
intervention
had
enabled
the
assyrians
to
deal
their
final
blow
at
the
one
idea
of
the
members
of
the
royal
house
was
to
depose
the
reigning
sovereign
and
they
considered
all
means
to
this
end
as
justifiable
whether
assassination
revolt
desertion
to
the
enemy
or
defection
on
the
very
field
of
battle
as
soon
as
one
of
them
had
dethroned
another
hatred
of
the
foreigner
again
reigned
supreme
in
his
breast
and
he
donned
his
armour
with
a
firm
determination
to
bring
the
struggle
to
an
end
but
the
course
he
had
pursued
towards
his
predecessor
was
now
adopted
by
one
of
his
relatives
towards
himself
the
enemy
meanwhile
was
still
under
arms
and
each
of
these
revolutions
brought
him
a
step
nearer
to
the
goal
of
his
endeavours
the
complete
overthrow
of
the
elamite
kingdom
and
its
annexation
to
the
empire
of
nineveh
even
before
the
struggle
with
babylon
was
concluded
had
demanded
of
indabigash
the
release
of
the
assyrians
whom
had
carried
off
in
his
train
besides
the
extradition
of
that
personage
himself
indabigash
had
no
desire
for
war
at
this
juncture
but
hesitated
to
surrender
the
kaldâ
who
had
always
served
him
faithfully
he
entered
into
negotiations
which
were
interminably
prolonged
neither
of
the
two
parties
being
anxious
to
bring
them
to
a
close
after
the
fall
of
babylon
who
was
tenacious
in
his
hatred
summoned
the
elamite
ambassadors
and
sent
them
back
to
their
master
with
a
message
conceived
in
the
following
menacing
terms
thou
dost
not
surrender
those
men
i
will
go
and
destroy
thy
cities
and
lead
into
captivity
the
inhabitants
of
susa
madaktu
and
khaidalu
i
will
hurl
thee
from
thy
throne
and
will
set
up
another
thereon
as
aforetime
i
destroyed
tiummân
so
will
i
destroy
a
detachment
of
troops
was
sent
to
enforce
the
message
of
defiance
but
when
the
messengers
had
reached
the
frontier
town
of
deri
indabigash
was
no
longer
there
his
nobles
had
assassinated
him
and
had
elected
the
son
of
king
in
his
stead
the
opportunity
was
a
favourable
one
to
sow
the
seeds
of
division
in
the
elamite
camp
before
the
usurper
should
have
time
to
consolidate
his
power
therefore
threw
himself
into
the
cause
of
tammaritu
supporting
him
with
an
army
to
which
many
malcontents
speedily
rallied
the
aramæans
and
the
cities
of
the
on
the
littoral
khilmu
billatê
dummuku
sulâa
lakhiru
and
dibirîna
submitted
without
a
struggle
and
the
invaders
met
with
no
resistance
till
they
reached
this
town
had
formerly
been
conquered
by
sennacherib
but
it
had
afterwards
returned
to
the
rule
of
its
ancient
masters
who
had
strongly
fortified
it
it
now
offered
a
determined
resistance
but
without
success
its
population
was
decimated
and
the
survivors
mutilated
and
sent
as
captives
into
assyria
among
them
the
commander
of
the
garrison
imbappi
of
together
with
the
harem
of
tiummân
with
his
sons
and
daughters
and
all
the
members
of
his
family
whom
his
successors
had
left
under
guard
in
the
citadel
the
siege
had
been
pushed
forward
so
rapidly
that
the
king
had
not
been
able
to
make
any
attempt
to
relieve
the
defenders
besides
this
a
pretender
had
risen
up
against
him
one
umbakhabua
who
had
been
accepted
as
king
by
the
important
district
of
bubîlu
the
fall
of
filled
the
two
competitors
with
fear
they
abandoned
their
homes
and
fled
the
one
to
the
mountains
the
other
to
the
lowlands
on
the
shores
of
the
tammaritu
entered
susa
in
triumph
and
was
enthroned
afresh
but
the
insolence
and
rapacity
of
his
auxiliaries
was
so
ruthlessly
manifested
that
at
the
end
of
some
days
he
resolved
to
rid
himself
of
them
by
the
sword
a
traitor
having
revealed
the
design
tammaritu
was
seized
stripped
of
his
royal
apparel
and
cast
into
prison
the
generals
of
had
no
one
whom
they
could
proclaim
king
in
his
stead
and
furthermore
the
season
being
well
advanced
the
elamites
who
had
recovered
from
their
first
alarm
were
returning
in
a
body
and
threatened
to
cut
off
the
assyrian
retreat
they
therefore
evacuated
susa
and
regained
assyria
with
their
booty
they
burnt
all
the
towns
along
the
route
whose
walls
were
insufficient
to
protect
them
against
a
sudden
escalade
or
an
attack
of
a
few
duration
and
the
country
between
the
capital
and
the
frontier
soon
contained
nothing
but
heaps
of
smoking
ruins
the
difficulty
we
experience
in
locating
on
the
map
most
of
the
names
of
elamite
towns
is
the
reason
why
we
can
not
determine
with
any
certainty
the
whole
itinerary
followed
by
the
assyrian
army
the
campaign
which
had
been
so
successful
at
the
outset
had
not
produced
all
the
results
expected
from
it
the
assyrians
had
hoped
henceforth
to
maintain
control
of
elam
through
tammaritu
but
in
a
short
time
they
had
been
obliged
to
throw
aside
the
instrument
with
which
they
counted
on
effecting
the
complete
humiliation
of
the
nation
had
reoccupied
susa
following
on
the
heels
of
the
last
assyrian
detachment
and
he
reigned
as
king
once
more
without
surrendering
or
restoring
the
statue
of
nana
or
fulfilling
any
of
the
conditions
which
had
been
the
price
of
a
title
to
the
throne
was
not
inclined
to
bear
patiently
this
partial
reverse
as
soon
as
spring
returned
he
again
demanded
the
surrender
of
the
chaldæan
and
the
goddess
under
pain
of
immediate
invasion
offered
to
expel
from
lakhiru
where
he
had
entrenched
himself
and
to
thrust
him
towards
the
assyrian
frontier
where
the
troops
would
be
able
to
capture
him
his
offer
was
not
accepted
and
a
second
embassy
headed
by
tammaritu
who
was
once
more
in
favour
arrived
to
propose
more
trenchant
terms
the
elamite
might
have
gone
so
far
as
to
grant
the
extradition
of
but
if
he
had
yielded
the
point
concerning
nana
a
rebellion
would
have
broken
out
in
the
streets
of
susa
he
preferred
war
and
prepared
in
desperation
to
carry
it
on
to
the
bitter
end
the
conflict
was
long
and
sanguinary
and
the
result
disastrous
for
elam
opened
its
gates
the
district
of
kashi
surrendered
at
discretion
followed
by
the
city
of
khamanu
and
its
environs
and
the
assyrians
approached
madaktu
evacuated
the
place
before
they
reached
it
and
withdrew
beneath
the
walls
of
on
the
western
bank
of
the
ididi
his
enemies
pursued
him
thither
but
the
stream
was
swift
and
swollen
by
rain
so
that
for
two
days
they
encamped
on
its
bank
without
daring
to
cross
and
were
perhaps
growing
discouraged
when
ishtar
of
arbela
once
more
came
to
the
rescue
appearing
in
a
dream
to
one
of
her
seers
she
said
myself
go
before
the
king
whom
my
hands
have
created
the
army
emboldened
by
this
revelation
overcame
the
obstacle
by
a
vigorous
effort
and
dashed
impetuously
over
regions
as
yet
unvisited
by
any
conqueror
the
assyrians
burnt
down
fourteen
royal
cities
numberless
small
towns
and
destroyed
the
cornfields
the
vines
and
the
orchards
utterly
exhausted
fled
to
the
mountains
a
young
banunu
and
the
districts
of
tasarra
twenty
cities
in
the
country
of
khumir
khaîdalu
and
bashimu
succumbed
one
after
another
and
when
the
invaders
at
length
decided
to
retrace
their
steps
to
the
frontier
susa
deserted
by
her
soldiers
and
deprived
of
her
leaders
lay
before
them
an
easy
prey
it
was
not
the
first
time
in
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
that
the
assyrians
had
had
the
city
at
their
mercy
they
had
made
some
stay
in
it
after
the
battle
of
tullîz
and
also
after
the
taking
of
in
the
preceding
year
but
on
those
occasions
they
had
visited
it
as
allies
to
enthrone
a
king
owing
allegiance
to
their
own
sovereign
and
political
exigencies
had
obliged
them
to
repress
their
pillaging
instincts
and
their
hatred
now
that
they
had
come
as
enemies
they
were
restrained
by
no
considerations
of
diplomacy
the
city
was
systematically
pillaged
and
the
booty
found
in
it
was
so
immense
that
the
sack
lasted
an
entire
month
the
royal
treasury
was
emptied
of
its
gold
and
silver
its
metals
and
the
valuable
objects
which
had
been
brought
to
it
from
sumir
accad
and
karduniash
at
successive
periods
from
the
most
remote
ages
down
to
that
day
in
the
course
of
the
successful
invasions
conducted
by
the
princes
of
susa
beyond
the
tigris
among
them
the
riches
of
the
babylonian
temples
which
had
lavished
on
tiumman
to
purchase
his
support
being
easily
distinguishable
the
furniture
of
the
palace
was
sent
to
nineveh
in
a
long
procession
it
comprised
beds
and
chairs
of
ivory
and
chariots
encrusted
with
enamel
and
precious
stones
the
horses
of
which
were
caparisoned
with
gold
the
soldiers
made
their
way
into
the
ziggurât
tore
down
the
plates
of
ruddy
copper
violated
the
sanctuary
and
desecrated
the
prophetic
statues

it

to

an

delighted

supplanted

those
lines
of

conquerors
who
had
levied

from

day
when

was

an
obscure
provincial
town
assyria
alone
remained
enthroned
on
the
ruins
of

past
and
her
dominion
seemed
established
for
all
time
yet
on
closer
investigation
indications
were
not
wanting
of
the
cruel
sufferings
that
she
also
had
endured
once
again
as
after
the
wars
of
and
those
of
and
shalmaneser
her
chiefs
had
overtaxed
her
powers
by
a
long
series
of
unremitting
wars
against
vigorous
foes
doubtless
the
countries
comprised
within
her
wide
empire
furnished
her
with
a
more
ample
revenue
and
less
restricted
resources
than
had
been
at
the
command
of
the
little
province
of
ancient

which
had

bounded
by
the

and
the
zab

on

two

but
on
the
other
hand
the
adversaries
against
whom
she
had
measured
her
forces
and
whom
she
had
overthrown
were
more
important
and
of
far
greater
strength
than
her
former
rivals
she
had
paid
dearly
for
humiliating
egypt
and
laying
babylon
in
the
dust
as
soon
as
babylon
was
overthrown
she
had
without
pausing
to
take
breath
joined
issue
with
elam
and
had
only
succeeded
in
triumphing
over
it
by
drawing
upon
her
resources
to
the
utmost
during
many
years
when
the
struggle
was
over
she
realised
to
what
an
extent
she
had
been
weakened
by
so
lavish
an
outpouring
of
the
blood
of
her
citizens
the
babylonian
and
elamite
recruits
whom
she
incorporated
into
her
army
after
each
of
her
military
expeditions
more
or
less
compensated
for
the
void
which
victory
itself
had
caused
in
her
population
and
her
troops
but
the
fidelity
of
these
vanquished
foes
of
yesterday
still
smarting
from
their
defeat
could
not
be
relied
on
and
the
entire
assimilation
of
their
children
to
their
conquerors
was
the
work
of
at
least
one
or
two
generations
assyria
therefore
was
on
the
eve
of
one
of
those
periods
of
exhaustion
which
had
so
often
enfeebled
her
national
vitality
and
imperilled
her
very
existence
on
each
previous
occasion
she
had
it
is
true
recovered
after
a
more
or
less
protracted
crisis
and
the
brilliancy
of
her
prospects
though
obscured
for
a
moment
appeared
to
be
increased
by
their
temporary
eclipse
there
was
therefore
good
reason
to
hope
that
she
would
recover
from
her
latest
phase
of
depression
and
the
only
danger
to
be
apprehended
was
that
some
foreign
power
profiting
by
her
momentary
weakness
might
rise
up
and
force
her
while
still
suffering
from
the
effects

arising

becoming

growing

it

before
the

of
it

one
day
it
stands

in
the
splendour
of
its
glory
there
is
no
report
abroad
but
that
which
tells
of
its
riches
its
industry
its
valour
the
good
government
of
its
princes
and
the
irresistible
might
of
its
gods
and
the
world
filled
with
envy
or
with

its
good
fortune
immutable
never

applies
to
it
even
in

the
usual
commonplaces
on
the
instability
of
human
things
suddenly
an
ill
wind
blowing
up
from
the
distant
horizon
bursts
upon
it
in
destructive
squalls
and
it
is
overthrown
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
amid
the
glare
of
lightning
the
resounding
crash
of
thunder
whirlwinds
of
dust
and
rain
when
the
storm
has
passed
away
as
quickly
as
it
came
its
mutterings
heralding
the
desolation
which
it
bears
to
other
climes
the
brightening
sky
no
longer
reveals
the
old
contours
and
familiar
outlines
but
the
sun
of
history
rises
on
a
new
empire
emerging
as
if
by
the
touch
of
a
magic
wand
from
the
ruins
which
the
tempest
has
wrought
there
is
nothing
apparently
lacking
of
all
that
in
the
eyes
of
the
many
invested
its
predecessor
with
glory
it
seems
in
no
wise
inferior
in
national
vigour
in
the
number
of
its
soldiers
in
the
military
renown
of
its
chiefs
in
the
proud
prosperity
of
its
people
or
in
the
majesty
of
its
gods
the
present
fabric
is
as
spacious
and
magnificent
it
would
seem
as
that
which
has
but
just
vanished
into
the
limbo
of
the
past
no
kingdom
ever
shone
with
brighter
splendour
or
gave
a
greater
impression
of
prosperity
than
the
kingdom
of
assyria
in
the
days
succeeding
its
triumphs
over
blam
and
arabia
precisely
at
this
point
the
monuments
and
other
witnesses
of
its
activity
fail
us
just
as
if
one
of
the
acts
of
the
piece
in
which
it
had
played
a
chief
part
having
come
to
an
end
the
must
be
lowered
amid
a
flourish
of
trumpets
and
the
illuminations
of
an
apotheosis
to
allow
the
actors
a
little
half
a
century
rolls
by
during
which
we
have
a
dim
perception
of
the
subdued
crash
of
falling
empires
and
of
the
trampling
of
armies
in
fierce
fight
then
the
curtain
rises
on
an
utterly
different
drama
of
which
the
plot
has
been
woven
behind
the
scenes
and
the
exciting
has
just
come
into
play
we
no
longer
hear
of
assyria
and
its
kings
their
palaces
are
in
ruins
their
last
faithful
warriors
sleep
in
unhonoured
graves
beneath
the
ashes
of
their
cities
their
prowess
is
credited
to
the
account
of
half
a
dozen
fabulous
heroes
such
as
ninus
sardanapalus
and
semiramis
heroes
whose
names
call
up
in
the
memory
of
succeeding
generations
only
vague
but
terrible
images
such
as
the
phantasies
of
a
dream
which
although
but
dimly
remembered
in
the
morning
makes
the
hair
to
stand
on
end
with
terror
the
nations
which
erewhile
disputed
the
supremacy
with
assyria
have
either
suffered
a
like
eclipse
such
as
the
khâti
urartu
the
cossæans
and
elam
or
have
fallen
like
egypt
and
southern
syria
into
the
rank
of
powers
it
is
chaldaea
which
is
now
in
the
van
of
the
nations
in
company
with
lydia
and
with
media
whose
advent
to
imperial
power
no
one
would
have
ventured
to
predict
forty
or
fifty
years
before
the
principality
founded
by
deïokes
about
the
beginning
of
the
seventh
century
seemed
at
first
destined
to
play
but
a
modest
part
it
shared
the
fortune
of
the
states
with
which
the
ninevite
conquerors
came
in
contact
on
the
western
boundary
of
the
iranian
plateau
and
from
which
the
governors
of
arrapkha
or
of
kharkhar
had
extorted
tribute
to
the
utmost
as
often
as
occasion
offered
according
to
one
tradition
it
had
only
three
kings
in
an
entire
century
deïokes
up
till
phraortes
from
to
and
after
the
latter
year
cyaxares
the
hero
of
his
race
another
tradition
claimed
an
earlier
foundation
for
the
monarchy
and
doubled
both
the
number
of
the
kings
and
the
age
of
the
kingdom
this
is
the
tradition
gleaned
by
herodotus
probably
at
sardes
from
the
mouths
of
persians
residing
in
that
city
this
is
the
tradition
derived
from
the
court
of
artaxerxes
by
ctesias
of
cnidus
volney
discovered
the
principle
upon
which
the
chronology
of
his
median
dynasty
was
based
by
ctesias
if
we
place
his
list
side
by
side
with
that
of
herodotus
illustration
and
table
of
median
dynasty
we
see
that
while
rejecting
the
names
given
by
herodotus
ctesias
repeats
twice
over
the
number
of
years
assigned
by
the
latter
to
the
reigns
of
his
kings
at
least
for
the
four
last
generations
at
the
beginning
herodotus
gives
before
deïokes
an
interregnum
of
uncertain
duration
ctesias
substituted
the
round
number
of
fifty
years
for
the
assigned
to
deïokes
and
replaced
the
interregnum
by
a
reign
which
he
estimated
at
the
mean
duration
of
a
human
generation
thirty
years
he
then
applied
to
this
new
pair
of
numbers
the
process
of
doubling
he
had
employed
for
the
couple
mentioned
above
the
number
has
been
attributed
to
the
reign
of
arbakes
instead
of
the
number
thirty
to
give
an
air
of
truthfulness
to
the
whole
catalogue
this
tradition
ignored
the
monarchs
who
had
rendered
the
second
assyrian
empire
illustrious
and
substituted
for
them
a
line
of
inactive
sovereigns
reputed
to
be
the
descendants
of
ninus
and
semiramis
the
last
of
them
sardanapalus
had
according
to
this
account
lived
a
life
of
in
his
harem
surrounded
by
women
dressing
himself
in
their
garb
and
adopting
feminine
occupations
and
amusements
the
satrap
of
media
arbakes
saw
him
at
his
toilet
and
his
heart
turned
against
yielding
obedience
to
such
a
painted
doll
he
rebelled
in
concert
with
belesys
the
babylonian
the
imminence
of
the
danger
thus
occasioned
roused
sardanapalus
from
his
torpor
and
revived
in
him
the
warlike
qualities
of
his
ancestors
he
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
his
troops
overcame
the
rebels
and
was
about
to
exterminate
them
when
his
hand
was
stayed
by
the
defection
of
some
bactrian
auxiliaries
he
shut
himself
up
in
nineveh
and
for
two
whole
years
heroically
repulsed
all
assaults
in
the
third
year
the
tigris
swollen
by
the
rains
overflowed
its
banks
and
broke
down
the
city
walls
for
a
distance
of
twenty
stadia
the
king
thereupon
called
to
mind
an
oracle
which
had
promised
him
victory
until
the
day
when
the
river
should
betray
him
judging
that
the
prediction
was
about
to
be
accomplished
he
resolved
not
to
yield
himself
alive
to
the
besieger
and
setting
fire
to
his
palace
perished
therein
together
with
his
children
and
his
treasures
about
arbakes
thus
rendered
an
independent
sovereign
handed
down
the
monarchy
to
his
son
mandaukas
and
he
in
his
turn
was
followed
successively
by
sosarmos
artykas
arbianes
artaios
artynes
and
astibaras
these
names
are
not
the
work
of
pure
invention
they
are
met
with
in
more
than
one
assyrian
text
among
the
petty
kings
who
paid
tribute
to
sargon
are
enumerated
some
which
bear
such
names
as
mashdaku
ashpanda
arbaku
and
khartukka
and
many
others
of
whom
traces
ought
to
be
found
some
day
among
the
archives
of
princely
families
of
later
times
oppert
thought
that
the
names
given
by
herodotus
represented
forms
of
turanian
names
of
which
otesias
has
given
the
persian
mashdaku
is
identified
by
post
with
the
mandaukas
or

of
ctesias
which
would
then
be
a
error
for
masdaukas

ctesias
gives
instead
of
the
astyages
of

the
name
of
artykas
is
also
found
in
the
secondary
form
kardikoas
which
is
nearer
the
khartukka
of
the
assyrian
texts
there
were
in
these
archives
at
the
disposal
of
scribes
and
strangers
inclined
to

of

of

value

documents
inscribed

and
records
of
real
victories
and
conquests
exaggerated
in
accordance
with
the
vanity
or
the
interest
of
the
composer
from
these
elements
it
was
easy
to
compile
lists
of
median
kings
which
had
no
real
connection
with
each
other
as
far
as
their
names
order
of
succession
or
duration
of
reign
were
concerned
the
assyrian
chronicles
have
handed
down
to
us
in
place
of
these
dynasties
which
were
alleged
to
have
exercised
authority
over
the
whole
territory
a
considerable
number
of
noble
houses
scattered
over
the
country
each
of
them
autonomous
and
a
rival
of
its
neighbour
and
only
brought
into
agreement
with
one
another
at
rare
intervals
by
their
common
hatred
of
the
invader
some
of
them
were
representatives
of
ancient
races
akin
to
the
susians
and
perhaps
to
the
first
inhabitants
of
chaldæa
others
belonged
to
tribes
of
a
fresh
stock
that
of
the
aryans
and
more
particularly
to
the
iranian
branch
of
the
aryan
family
we
catch
glimpses
of
them
in
the
reign
of
shalmaneser
who
calls
them
the
amadaî
then
after
this
first
brush
with
assyria
intercourse
and
conflict
between
the
two
nations
became
more
and
more
frequent
every
year
until
the
soon
began
to
figure
among
the
regular
adversaries
of
the
ninevite
armies
and
even
the
haughtiest
monarchs
refer
with
pride
to
victories
gained
over
them
waged
ceaseless
war
against
them
iii
twice
drove
them
before
him
from
the
to
the
as
far
as
the
foot
of
demavend
while
sargon
sennacherib
and
esarhaddon
during
their
respective
reigns
kept
anxious
watch
upon
them
and
endeavoured
to
maintain
some
sort
of
authority
over
the
tribes
which
lay
nearest
to
them
both
in
the
personal
names
and
names
of
objects
which
have
come
down
to
us
in
the
records
of
these
campaigns
we
detect
iranian
characteristics
in
spite
of
the
semitic
garb
with
which
the
inscriptions
have
invested
them
among
the
names
of
countries
we
find
partukka
diristânu
patusharra
nishaîa
urivzân
abîruz
and
ariarma
while
the
men
bear
such
names
as
ishpabarra
eparna
shîtirparna
uarzân
and
dayaukku
as
we
read
through
the
lists
faint
resemblances
in
sound
awaken
dormant
classical
memories
and
the
ear
detects
familiar
echoes
in
the
names
of
those
persians
whose
destinies
were
for
a
time
linked
with
those
of
athens
and
sparta
in
the
days
of
darius
and
of
xerxes
it
is
like
the
first
breath
of
greek
influence
faint
and
almost
imperceptible
as
yet
wafted
to
us
across
the
denser
atmosphere
of
the
east
the
iranians
had
a
vague
remembrance
of
a
bygone
epoch
during
which
they
had
wandered
in
company
with
other
nations
of
the
same
origin
as
themselves
in
that
cradle
of
the
aryan
peoples
modern
historians
at
first
placed
their
mythical
birthplace
in
the
wilder
regions
of
central
asia
near
the
oxus
and
the
jaxartes
and
not
far
from
the
of
pamir
which
they
regarded
as
the
original
point
of
departure
of
the
races
they
believed
that
a
large
body
of
these
primitive
aryans
must
have
descended
southwards
into
the
basin
of
the
indus
and
its
affluents
and
that
other
detachments
had
installed
themselves
in
the
oases
of
margiana
and
khorasmia
while
the
iranians
would
have
made
their
way
up
to
the
plateau
which
separates
the
caspian
sea
from
the
persian
gulf
where
they
sought
to
win
for
themselves
a
territory
sufficient
for
their
wants
the
compilers
of
the
sacred
books
of
the
iranians
claimed
to
be
able
to
trace
each
stage
of
their
peregrinations
and
to
describe
the
various
accidents
which
befell
them
during
this
heroic
period
of
their
history
according
to
these
records
it
was
no
mere
chance
or
love
of
adventure
which
had
led
them
to
wander
for
years
from
clime
to
clime
but
rather
a
divine
decree
while
ahurômazdaô
the
beneficent
deity
whom
they
worshipped
had
provided
them
with
agreeable
a
perverse
spirit
named
angrômaînyus
had
on
every
occasion
rendered
their
sojourn
there
impossible
by
the
plagues
which
he
inflicted
on
them
bitter
cold

had
compelled
them
to
forsake

mûru
locusts
had
driven
them
from
sughdhâ
the
incursions
of
the
nomad
tribes
coupled
with
their
immorality
had
forced
them
to
retire
from
mûru
to
bâkhdhî
country
of
lofty
banners
and
subsequently
to
nisaya
which
lies
to
the
between
mûru
and

from
thence
they
made
their

into
the

the

two
great
families
into
which
the
oriental
aryans
were
divided
viz
the
indian
and
iranian
and
in
the

to
account
for
the
peopling
by
the
iranians
of
a
certain
number
of
provinces
between
the
indus
and
the
euphrates
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
more
likely
that
the
iranians
came
originally
from
europe
and
that
they
migrated
from
the
steppes
of
southern
russia
into
the
plains
of
the
kur
and
the
araxes
by
way
of

the
name
khnenta
seems
to
have
been
hellenised
into
that
of

borne
by
a
river
which
formed

between
hyrcania

really
a
river
of

the

which
qualifies

been

by

raghâ

identified
with

order
of
things
and
derived

sauromato

other
scythian
tribes
from

it
is
possible
that
some
of
their
hordes
may
have
endeavoured
to
wedge
themselves
in
between
the
halys
and
the
euphrates
as
far
as
the
centre
of

minor
their
presence
in

quarter
would
explain
why
we
encounter
iranian
personal
names
in

spurs
of

such
as
that
of

by
fr
lenormant
the
name
kundashpi
with
that
of
vindâspa
by
gutschmid

later
on

added
to
these
a
long
list
of
names
in
egyptian

assyrian
inscriptions
which
he
looks
upon
as
iranian

at
first
sight
gundobunas

name
of
the
sassanid
epoch

form

adopts
the
identification

but
it
is
manifest
both
from
the
evidence
of
the
inscriptions
and
from
the
observations
of
travellers
that
the
whole
of
media
was
formerly
well
wooded
the
intermediate
valleys
were
veritable
orchards
in
which
the
vegetation
of
the
temperate

not
that
the

the

of

increases
as
they
come
to
an
end
one
after

has
been
introduced

of

is
quite
as
great
as

from

was
known
as
the
modicum

was
credited
with
the
property
of
being
a
powerful
antidote
to

it
was
supposed
that

much
merriment
among

of

there
were
moreover
several
breeds

the

greatly
prized

of
its
size

of
any

we
possess
no
original
documents
which
owe
their
existence
to
this
nation
and
the
whole
of
our
information
concerning
its
history
is
borrowed
from
assyrian
and
babylonian
inscriptions

from
the
various
legends
collected
by
the
greeks

by
herodotus
and
ctesias
from

magnates

at

from
fragments
of

works
such
as
the
writings
of

and
yet
modern
archaeologists
and
philologists
have
during
the
last
thirty
years
allowed
their
critical
faculties
and
often
their
imagination
as
well
to
run
riot
when
dealing
with
this
very
period
after
carefully
examining
one
after
another
most
of
the
theories

have
adopted
those
hypotheses
which
while
most
nearly
approximating

harmonise
best
with
the
chronological
framework
far
too
imperfect
as
yet
furnished
by
the
inscriptions
dealing
with
the
closing
years
of
nineveh
i
do
not
consider
them
all
to
be
equally
probable
but
though
they
may
be
mere
solutions
they
have
at
least
the
merit
of
reproducing
in
many
cases
the
ideas
current
among
those
races
of
antiquity
who
had
been
in

began
very
wisely

of

by

illustration
a
persian
drawn
by
boudier
from
a
photograph
of
one
of
the
reliefs
at
persepolis
in
dieulafoy
the
persians
were
a
and
observant
race
inured
to
all
kinds
of
hardships
in
their
occupation
as
mountain
shepherds
and
they
were
born
warriors
the
type
preserved
on
the
monuments
differs
but
little
from
that
which
still
exists
at
the
present
day
in
the
more
remote
districts
it
was
marked
by
a
tall
and
slender
figure
with
sturdy
shoulders
and
loins
a
small
head
with
a
thick
shock
of
hair
and
curling
beard
a
straight
nose
a
determined
mouth
and
an
eye
steady
and
alert
yet
in
spite
of
their
valour
phraortes
overpowered
them
and
was
henceforward
able
to
reckon
the
princes
of
anshân
among
his
vassals
strengthened
by
the
addition
of
their
forces
to
his
own
he
directed
his
efforts
to
the
subjection
of
the
other
races
of
the
plateau
if
we
may
believe
the
tradition
of
the
hellenic
epoch
he
reduced
them
to
submission
and
intoxicated
by
his
success
ventured
at
last
to
take
up
arms
against
the
assyrians
who
for
centuries
past
had
held
rule
over
upper
asia
this
was
about
or
less
than
ten
years
after
the
downfall
of
elam
and
it
does
not
seem
likely
that
the
vital
forces
of
assyria
can
have
suffered
any
serious
diminution
within
so
short
a
space
of
time
the
date
is
indicated
by
the
figures
given
by
herodotus
in
regard
to
the
medic
kings
based
on
the
calculations
of
himself
or
his
authorities
phraortes
died
in
after
a
reign
of
years
and
as
the
last
year
of
his
reign
coincides
with
the
war
against
assyria
the
preparations
for
it
can
not
have
been
much
earlier
than
or
a
year
or
two
before
the
catastrophe
weary
of
fighting
even
though
he
no
longer
directed
operations
in
person
had
apparently
determined
to
remain
entirely
on
the
defensive
and
not
to
take
the
field
unless
absolutely
compelled
to
do
so
by
rebellion
at
home
or
an
attack
from
outside
in
view
of
the
growing
need
of
rest
for
the
assyrian
nation
he
could
not
have
arrived
at
a
wiser
decision
provided
always
that
circumstances
allowed
of
its
being
carried
into
effect
and
that
the
tributary
races
and
frontier
nations
were
willing
to
fall
in
with
his
intentions
they
did
so
at
first
for
the
fate
of
elam
had
filled
even
the
most
unruly
among
them
with
consternation
and
peace
reigned
supreme
from
the
persian
gulf
to
the
mediterranean
took
advantage
of
this
unexpected
lull
to
push
forward
the
construction
of
public
works
in
the
valleys
of
the
tigris
and
euphrates
the
palace
of
sennacherib
though
it
had
been
built
scarcely
fifty
years
before
was
already
beginning
to
totter
on
its
foundations
entirely
remodeled
and
restored
it
a
proceeding
which
gave
universal
satisfaction
the
common
people
had
as
usual
to
make
the
bricks
with
their
own
hands
and
convey
them
to
the
spot
but
as
the
chariots
employed
for
this
purpose
formed
part
of
the
booty
recently
brought
back
from
elam
the
privilege
of
using
these
trophies
did
something
to
lighten
the
burden
of
the
tasks
imposed
on
them
moreover
they
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
at
work
among
the
squads
of
labourers
several
real
kings
the
arabian
chiefs
who
had
been
pursued
and
captured
in
the
heart
of
the
desert
by
generals
they
plodded
along
under
their
heavy
baskets
stimulated
by
the
crack
of
the
whip
amid
insults
and
jeers
this
palace
was
one
of
the
largest
and
most
ornate
ever
built
by
the
rulers
of
assyria
true
the
decoration
does
not
reveal
any
novel
process
or
theme
we
find
therein
merely
the
usual
scenes
of
battle
or
of
the
chase
but
they
are
designed
and
executed
with
a
skill
to
which
the
sculptor
of
nineveh
had
never
before
attained
the
animals
in
particular
are
portrayed
with
a
light
and
delicate
touch
the
wild
asses
pursued
by
hounds
or
checked
while
galloping
at
full
speed
by
a
cast
of
the
lasso
the
herds
of
goats

gazelles
hurrying
across
the
desert
the
wounded
lioness
which
raises
herself
with
a
last
dying
effort
to
roar
at
the
beaters
we
are
conscious
of
egyptian
influence
underlying
the
asiatic
work
and
the
skilful
arrangement
of
the
scenes
from
the
elamite
campaigns
also
reminds
us
of
egypt
the
picture
of
the
battle
of
tullîz
recalls
in
the
variety
of
its
episodes
and
the
arrangement
of
the
perspective
the
famous
engagement
at
qodshu
of
which
ramses
ii
has
left
such
numerous
presentments
on
the
theban
pylons
the
assyrians
led
by
the
vicissitudes
of
invasion
to
luxor
and
the
ramesseum
had
doubtless
seen
these
masterpieces
of
egyptian
art
in
a
less
mutilated
state
than
that
in
which
we
now
possess
them
and
profited
by
the
remembrance
when
called
upon
to
depict
the
private
life
of
their
king

the
victories
gained

the

his

entertainments
in
the
gardens
in
company
with
the
women
of
the

by
pleasures
of
a

refined
nature

that
he
took
an
unusual
interest
in
the
history

literature
of
the
races
who
had
become
subject
to
his
rule
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
have
been
discovered
in
several
of
the
ruined
chambers
of
his
palaces
the
remains
of
a
regular
library
which
must
originally
have
contained
thousands
of
clay
tablets
all
methodically
arranged
and
catalogued
for
his
use
a

of
them
furnish

these
documents
reveal
to
us
the
whole
machinery
of
government
in
actual
operation

we
almost
seem
to
witness
the
secret
mechanism
by
which
the
kingdom
was
maintained

activity

were
looked

to
be

carried

to

of
the

they
had
been
placed
in

there
they
remained
until
esarhaddon
the

was
forced
to
deliver
up
the
statue
of
marduk
and
restore
to
the
sanctuaries
now
rebuilt
all
the
wealth
of
which
his
grandfather
had
robbed
them
but
before
sending
back
the
tablets
he
ordered
copies
to
be
made
of
them
and
his
secretaries
set
to
work
to
transcribe
for
his
use
such
of
these
works
as
they
considered
worthy
of
reproduction
the
majority
of
them
were
treatises
compiled
by
the
most
celebrated
adepts
in
the
sciences
for
which
chaldæa
had
been
famous
from
time
immemorial
they
included
collections
of
omens
celestial
and
terrestrial
in
which
the
mystical
meaning
of
each
phenomenon
and
its
influence
on
the
destinies
of
the
world
was
explained
by
examples
borrowed
from
the
annals
of
conquerors
such
as
naramsin
and
sargon
of
agade
then
there
were
formulæ
for
exorcising
evil
spirits
from
the
bodies
of
the
possessed
and
against
phantoms
vampires
and
ghosts
the
recognised
causes
of
all
disease
prayers
and
psalms
which
had
to
be
repeated
before
the

in
order
to
obtain
pardon
for
sin
and
histories
of
divinities
and
kings
from
the
time
of
the
creation
down

the
latest
date
among
these
latter
were
several
versions
of
the
epic
of
grilgames
the
story
of
etana
of

and
many
others
and
we
may
hope
to
possess
all
that
the
assyrians
knew
of
the
old
chaldæan
literature
in
the
seventh
century
as
soon
as
the
excavators
have
unearthed
from

which
still
lie
hidden
there

from
the
shreds

which
they
have
already
yielded
to
us
we
are
able
to
piece
together
so
varied
a
picture
that
we
can
readily
imagine
to
have
been
a
learned
and
studious
monarch
a
patron
of
literature
and
antiquarian
knowledge
very
possibly
he
either
read
himself
or
had
read
to
him
many
of
the
authors
whose
works
found
a
place
in
his
library
the
kings
of
nineveh
like
the
pharaohs
desired
now
and
then
to
be
amused
by
tales
of
the
marvellous
and
they
were
doubtless
keenly
alive
to
the
delightful
rhythm
and
beautiful
language
employed
by
the
poets
of
the
past
in
singing
the
praises
of
their
divine
or
heroic
ancestors
but
the
mere
fact
that
his
palace
contained
the
most
important
literary
collection
which
the
ancient
east
has
so
far
bequeathed
to
us
in
no
way
proves
that
displayed
a
more
pronounced
taste
for
literature
than
his
predecessors
it
indicates
merely
the
zeal
and
activity
of
his
librarians
their
intelligence
and
their
respect
and
admiration
for
the
great
works
of
the
past
once
he
had
issued
his
edict
ordering
new
editions
of
the
old
masters
to
be
prepared
may
have
dismissed
the
matter
from
his
mind
and
the
work
would
go
on
automatically
without
need
for
any
further
interference
on
his
part
the
scribes
enriched
his
library
for
him
in
much
the
same
way
as
the
generals
won
his
battles
or
the
architects
built
his
monuments
they
were
nothing
more
than
nameless
agents
whose
individuality
was
eclipsed
by
that
of
their
master
their
skill
and
talent
being
all
placed
to
his
credit
babylonia
shared
equally
with
assyria
in
the
benefits
of
his
government
he
associated
himself
with
his
brother
in
the
task
of
completing
the
temple
of
afterwards
when
sole
monarch
he
continued
the
work
of
restoration
not
only
in
babylon
but
in
the
lesser
cities
as
well
especially
those
which
had
suffered
most
during

as

borsippa

end
of
the

of
his

against
and

those
at

he
remodelled
the
temple
of
bel
at
nippur
the
walls
built
there
by
him
being
even
now
distinguishable
from
the
rest
by
the
size
of
the
bricks
and
the
careful
dressing
of
the
masonry
from
the
shores
of
the
persian
gulf
to
the
mountains
of
armenia
assyria
and
karduniash
were
covered

just
as
they

most
peaceful
days
of
the
monarchy

is
nothing
to

that
his
action
took
place
simultaneously

with

serious

in
any
of

provinces
for
my
part
i
prefer
to
set
it
down
to
one
of
those
sudden
impulses
those
irresistible
outbursts
of
which
from
time
to
time
actuated
the
princes
tributary
to
nineveh
or
the
kings
on
its
frontier
the
period
of
inactivity
to
which
some
previous
defeat
inflicted
on
them
or
on
their
predecessors
had
condemned
them
allowed
them
to
regain
their
strength
and
one
or
two
victories
over
less
powerful
neighbours
served
to
obliterate
the
memory
of
former
humiliation
and
disaster
they
flew
to
arms
full
of
hope
in
the
result
and
once
more
drew
down
defeat
upon
their
heads
being
lucky
indeed
if
their
abortive
rising
led
to
nothing
worse
than
the
slaughter
of
their
armies
the
execution
of
their
generals
and
an
increase
in
the
amount
of
their
former
tribute
this
was
the
fate
that
overtook
phraortes
the
conqueror
of
the
persians
when
confronted
by
the
veteran
troops
of
assyria
failed
before
their
superior
discipline
and
was
left
dead
upon
the
field
of
battle
with
the
greater
part
of
his
army
so
far
the
affair
presented
no
unusual
features
it
was
merely
one
more
commonplace
repetition
of
a
score
of
similar
episodes
which
had
already
taken
place
in
the
same
region
under
iii
or
the
early
sargonides
but
huvakshatara
the
son
of
phraortes
known
to
the
greeks
as
cyaxares
instead
of
pleading
for
mercy
continued
to
offer
a
stubborn
resistance
cyaxares
belongs
to
history
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
exercised
a
decisive
influence
over
the
destinies
of
the
oriental
world
but
precise
details
of
his
exploits
are
wanting
and
his
personality
is
involved
in
such
obscuring
mists
that
we
can
scarcely
seize
it
the
little
we
have
so
far
been
able
to
glean
concerning
him
shows
us
not
so
much
the
man
himself
as
a
vague
shadow
of
him
seen
dimly
through
the
haze
the
original
form
of
the
name
is
furnished
by
passages
in
the
behistun
inscription
where
chitrantakhma
of
sagartia
and
fravartish
of
media
two
of
the
claimants
for
the
throne
who
rose
against
darius
are
represented
as
tracing
their
descent
from
huvakshatara
his
achievements
prove
him
to
have
been
one
of
those
perfect
rulers
of
men
such
as
asia
produces
every
now
and
then
who
knew
how
to
govern
as
well
as
how
to
win
battles
a
born
general
and
lawgiver
who
could
carry
his
people
with
him
and
shone
no
less
in
peace
than
in
war
rawlinson
takes
a
somewhat
different
view
of
character
he
admits
that
cyaxares
knew
how
to
win
victories
but
refuses
to
credit
him
with
the
capacity
for
organisation
required
in
order
to
reap
the
full
benefits
of
conquest
giving
as
his
reason
for
this
view
the
brief
duration
of
the
medic
empire
the
test
applied
by
him
does
not
seem
to
me
a
conclusive
one
for
the
existence
of
the
second
chaldæan
empire
was
almost
as
short
and
yet
it
would
be
decidedly
unfair
to
draw
similar
inferences
touching
the
character
of
nabopolassar
or
nebuchadrezzar
from
this
fact

the

persians
the
armies
at
the
disposal
of
his
predecessors
had
been
little
more
than
heterogeneous
assemblies
of
feudal
militia
each
clan
furnished
its
own
contingent
of
cavalry
archers
and
pikemen
but
instead
of
all
these
being
combined
into
a
common
whole
with
kindred
elements
contributed
by
the
other
tribes
each
one
acted
separately
thus
forming
a
number
of
small
independent
armies
within
the
larger
one
cyaxares
saw
that
defeat
was
certain
so
long
as
he
had
nothing
but
these
masses
to
match
against
the
regular
forces
of
assyria
he
therefore
broke
up
the
tribal
contingents
and
rearranged
the
units
of
which
they
were
composed
according
to
their
natural
affinities
grouping
horsemen
with
horsemen
archers
with
archers
and
pikemen
with
pikemen
taking
the
assyrian
cavalry
and
infantry
as
his
models
herodotus
tells
us
that
cyaxares
was
first
to
divide
the
asiatics
into
different
regiments
separating
the
pikemen
from
the
archers
and
horsemen
before
his
time
these
troops
were
all
mixed
up
haphazard
i
have
interpreted
his
evidence
in
the
sense
which
seems
most
in
harmony
with
what
we
know
of
assyrian
military
tactics
it
seems
incredible
that
the
medic
armies
can
have
fought
as
herodotus
declares
seeing
that
for
two
hundred
years
past
the
medes
had
been
frequently
engaged
against
such
troops
as
those
of
assyria
if
the
statement
be
authentic
it
merely
means
that
cyaxares
converted
all
the
small
feudal
armies
which
had
hitherto
fought
side
by
side
on
behalf
of
the
king
into
a
single
royal
army
in
which
the
different
kinds
of
troops
were
kept
separate
the
wore
a
high
felt
cap
known
as
a
tiara
they
had
long
tunics
with
wide
sleeves
tied
in
at
the
waist
by
a
belt
and
sometimes
reinforced
by
iron
plates
or
scales
as
well
as
gaiters
buskins
of
soft
leather
and
large
wickerwork
shields
covered
with
which
they
bore
in
front
of
them
like
a
movable
bulwark
their
weapons
consisted
of
a
short
sword
which
depended
from
the
belt
and
lay
along
the
thigh
one
or
two
light
javelins
a
bow
with
a
strongly
pronounced
curve
and
a
quiver
full
of
arrows
made
from
reeds
their
horsemen
like
those
of
other
warlike
nations
ii
of
the
east
used
neither
saddle
nor
stirrups
and
though
they
could
make
skilful
use
of
lance
and
sword
their
favourite
weapon
was
the
bow
herodotus
describes
the
equipment
of
the
persians
in
much
the
same
terms
as
i
have
used
above
and
then
adds
in
the
following
chapter
that
medes
had
the
same
equipment
for
it
is
the
equipment
of
the
medes
and
not
that
of
the
herodotus
says
that
the
medic
horsemen
were
armed
in
the

manner

exercises
they
seemed
to
sit
their
horses
as
though
they
actually
formed
part
of
the
animal
they
seldom
fought
in
line
but
from
the
very
beginning
of
an
action
hung
like
a
dense
cloud
on
the
front
and
flanks
of
the
enemy
and
riddled
them
with
missiles
without
however
coming
to
close
quarters
like
the
parthians
of
a
later
epoch
they
waited
until
they
had
bewildered
and
reduced
the
foe
by
their
ceaseless
evolutions
before
giving
the
final
charge
which
was
to
rout
them

no
greater
danger
could
threaten
the
assyrians
than
the
establishment
of
a
systematically
organised
military
power

invader
starting
from
egypt
or
asia
minor
even
if
he
succeeded
in
overthrowing
the
forces
sent
out
to
meet
him
had
still
a
long
way
to
go
before
he
could
penetrate
to
the
heart
of
the
empire
even
if
cilicia
and
syria
should
be
conquered
nothing
was
easier
than
to
oppose
a
further
advance
at
the
barrier
of
the
euphrates
and
should
the
euphrates
be
crossed
the
khabur
still
remained
and
behind
it
the
desert
of
singar
which
offered
the
last
obstacle
between
nineveh
and
the
invaders
the
distances
were
less
considerable
in
the
case
of
an
army
setting
out
from
urartu
and
proceeding
along
the
basin
of
the
tigris
or
its
affluents
but
here
too
the
difficulties
of
transit
were
so
serious
that
the
invader
ran
a
great
risk
of
gradually
losing
the
best
part
of
his
forces

nineveh
escaped
the
fate
with
which
the
prophet
had
threatened
it
but
its
safety
was
dearly
bought

to
the
tradition
accepted
in

two
hundred
years
later
a
horde
of
scythians
under
king
madyes
son
of
protothyes
setting
out
from
the
bussian
steppes
in
pursuit
of
the
cimmerians
made
their
appearance
on
the
scene
in
the
nick
of
time
we
are
told
that
they
flung
themselves
through
the
caspian
gates
into
the
basin
of
the
kur
and
came
into
contact
with
the
medes
at
the
foot
of
mount
caucasus
the
defeat
of
the
medes
here
would
necessarily
compel
them
to
raise
the
siege
of
nineveh
this
crisis
in
the
history
of
asia
was
certainly
not
determined
by
chance
for
eighty
years
assyria
had
been
in
contact
with
the
scythians
and
the
assyrian
kings
had
never
ceased
to
keep
an
eye
upon
their
movements
or
lose
sight
of
the
advantage
to
which
their
bellicose
temper
might
be
turned
in
circumstances
like
the
present
they
had
pitted
them
against
the
cimmerians
then
against
the
medes
and
probably
against
the
kings
of
urartu
as
well
and
the
intimacy
between
the
two
peoples
came
to
be
so
close
that
the
scythian
king
bartatua
did
not
hesitate
to
demand
one
of
the
daughters
of
bsarhaddon
in
marriage
from
the
very
beginning
of
his
reign
had
shown
them
the
utmost
consideration
and
when
king
madyes
son
of
his
ally
bartatua
intervened
thus
opportunely
in
the
struggle
he
did
so
not
by
mere
chance
as
tradition
would
have
us
believe
but
at
the
urgent
request
of
assyria
he
attacked
media
in
the
rear
and
cyaxares
compelled
to
raise
the
siege
of
nineveh
hastened
to
join
battle
with
him
the
engagement
probably
took
place
on
the
banks
of
the
lower
araxes
or
to
the
north
of
lake
urumiah
in
the
region
formerly
inhabited
by
the
mannai

after
defeating
his
foe
and
dictating
to
him
the
terms
of
submission
madyes
carried
away
by
the
lust
of
conquest
did
not
hesitate
to
turn
his
arms
against
his
ally
exhausted
by
her
recent
struggle
assyria
lay
at
his
mercy
her
fortresses
alone
being
able
to
offer
any
serious
resistance
he
overran
the
country
from
end
to
end
and
though
the
walled
cities
withstood
the
fury
of
his
attack
the
rural
districts
were
plundered
right
and
left
and
laid
desolate
for
many
a
year
to
come
the
scythians
of
this
epoch
probably
resembled

we
find
represented

to

they
found
in

path
they
ruined

years

overturned
everything

reputation

him
a
place
beside
sesostris
among
the
conquerors
of
the
heroic
age
and
no
doubt
like
his
predecessor
dugdamis
he
owed
this
distinction
to
some
expedition
or
other
against
the
peoples
who
dwelt
on
the
shores
of
the
ægean
sea
but
our
knowledge
of
his
career
is
confined
to
the
final
catastrophe
which
overtook
him

some
partial
successes

that
near

he
was
defeated
and

at

made
their

on
the

it
seems
probable
that
this
was
so
when
we
consider
the
confusion
between
the
scythians
or
sakse
and
the
cimmerians
in
the
babylonian
and
persian
inscriptions
of
the
achsemenian
epoch
their
migration
from
media
into
syria
and
palestine
is
expressly
mentioned
by
herodotus
since
the
day
when
sennacherib
had
been
compelled
to
return
to
assyria
without
having
succeeded
in
destroying
jerusalem
or
even
carrying
it

had
taken

conflict

party

advised

more
warlike

advocated

had

we
know

to
intervene
in
the

the
hour
but
the
prompt
punishment
which
followed
his

attempt
put
an
end
for
ever
to
his
desire
for
independence
his
successor

during
his
brief
reign

two
years
had
no

ways
of

father

either
take
off
ten

reducing
the
duration

to
years

else
we
must
assume
the
first
ten
of
manasseh
to
be
synchronous
with
the
last
ten
of
hezekiah
kings

cf
chron

thus
for
more
than
fifty
years
judah
enjoyed
almost
unbroken
peace
and
led
as
happy
and
prosperous
an
existence
as
the
barrenness
of
its
soil
and
the
unruly
spirit
of
its
inhabitants
would
permit
but
though
its
political
activity
had
been
almost
nothing
during
this
interval
its
spiritual
life
had
seldom
been
developed
with
a
greater
intensity
the
reverse
sustained
by
sennacherib
had
undoubtedly
been
a
triumph
for
isaiah
and
for
the
religious
party
of
which
we
are
accustomed
to
regard
him
as
the
sole
representative
it
had
served
to
demonstrate
the
power
of
jahveh
and
his
aversion
for
all
idolatrous
worship
and
for
all
foreign
alliances

the
partisans
of
egypt
talk
loudly
of
pharaoh
and
of
all
those
principalities
of
this
world
which
were
drawn
round
in

egypt
had
shown
herself
incapable
of
safeguarding
her
friends
and
things
had
gone
steadily
from
bad
to
worse
so
long
as
these
latter
held
the
reins
of

removal
from

been

it
were
the
signal
for
a
welcome
change
in
the

jahveh
had
delivered
his
city
the
moment
when
ceasing
to
rely
upon
itself
it
had
surrendered
its
guidance
into
his
hands
and
the
means
of
avoiding
disaster
in
the
future
was
clearly
pointed
out
to
it
judah
must
be
content
to
follow
the
counsels
which
isaiah
had
urged
upon
it
in
the
name
of
the
most
high
and
submissively

isaiah
seems
to
disappear
after
his
triumph
and
none
of
his
later
prophecies
have
come
down
to
us
yet
the
influence
of
his
teaching
lasted
throughout
the
reign
of
hezekiah
and
the
court
supported
by
the
more
religious
section
of
the
people
not
only
abjured
the
worship
of
false
gods
but
forsook
the
high
places
and
discontinued
the
practices
which
he
had
so
strenuously
denounced
the
great
bulk
of
the
nation
however
soon
returned
to
their
idolatrous
practices
if
indeed
they
had
ever
given
them
up
and
many
of
the
royal
advisers
grew
weary
of
the
rigid
observances
which
it
was
sought
to
impose

in

recensions

manasseh
was
only
thirteen
years
old
when
he
came
to
the
throne
and
his
youth
naturally
inclined
him
towards
the
less
austere
forms
of
divine
worship
from
the
very
first
he
tolerated
much
that
his
father
had
forbidden
and
the
spirit
of
eclecticism
which
prevailed
among
his
associates
rendered
him
later
on
an
object
of
special
detestation

the
orthodox
historians
of

openly
to
frequent
the

again
lighted
up
by

flames

sacred
pyre
we
are
told
that
manasseh
himself
set
the
example
by
passing
his
son
through
the
flames
he
also
had
recourse
to
astrologers
soothsayers
and
sorcerers
of
the
lowest
type
the
example
of
assyria
in
matters
of
this
kind
exercised
a
preponderant
influence
on
jewish
customs
and
certainly
it
would
have
been
a
miracle
if
jerusalem
had
succeeded
in
escaping
it
did
not
nineveh
owe
the
lofty
place
it
occupied
to
these
occult
sciences
and
to
the
mysterious
powers
of
its
gods
in
thus
imitating
its
conqueror
judah
was
merely
borrowing
the
weapons
which
had
helped
him
to
subdue
the
world
the
partisans
of
the
ancient
religions
who
were
responsible
for
these
innovations
must
have
regarded
them
as
perfectly
legitimate
reforms
and
their
action
was
received
with
favour
in
the
provinces
before
long
the
latter
contained
as
many
sanctuaries
as
there
were
towns
and
by
thus
multiplying
the
centres
of
worship
they
hoped
that
in
accordance
with
ancient
belief
the
ties
which
existed
between
jahveh
and
his
chosen
people
would
also
be
increased

the

had
been
ravaged
from
end
to

in
the
days
of

while
jerusalem
had
been

was
attributed
to
the
circumstance
that
hezekiah
had
destroyed
the
provincial
sanctuaries
leaving
the
temple
on

alone
standing
wherever
jahveh
possessed

kept
guard
over
his
people
but
his
protection
was
not
extended
to
those
places
where
sacrifices
were
no
longer

him
the
reaction
was
not
allowed
to
take
place
without
opposition
on
the
part
of
the

their
followers

are
told
that

innocent

very
much
till
he
had
filled
jerusalem
from
one
end
to
another
there
is
even
a
kabbinic
tradition
to
the
effect
that
weary
of
the
admonitions
of
the
aged
isaiah
he
put
him
to
death
by
shutting
him
up
in
the
hollow
trunk
of
a
tree
and
causing
him
to
be
sawn
in
two
kings
xxi
the
tradition
in
regard
to
the
fate
of
isaiah
took
its
foundation
in
this
text
and
it
is
perhaps
indirectly
referred
to
in
heb
xi
for
a
long
time
after
this
no
instance
can
be
found
of
a
prophet
administering
public
affairs
or
directing
the
actions
of
the
king
himself
the
priests
and
reformers
finding
no
outlet
for
their
energy
in
this
direction
fell
back
on
private
preaching
and
literary
propaganda
and
above
all
they
applied
themselves
to
the
task
of
rewriting
the
history
of
israel
which
as
told
by
the
chroniclers
of
the
previous
century
presented
the
national
deity
in
too
material
a
light
and
one
which
failed
to
harmonise
with
the
ideals
then
obtaining
so
long
as
there
were
two
separate
hebrew
kingdoms
the
existence
of
the
two
parallel
versions
of
the
elohist
and
jahvist
gave
rise
to
but

each
version
had
its
own
supporters

whose
consciences
were
readily
satisfied
by
the
interpolation
of
a
few
new
facts
into
the
text
as
occasion
arose
but
now
that
samaria
had
fallen
and
the
whole
political
and
religious
life
of
the
hebrew
race
was
centred
in
judah
alone
the
necessity
for
a
double
and
often
contradictory
narrative
had
ceased
to
exist
and
the
idea
occurred
of
combining
the
two
in
a
single
work
this
task
which
was
begun
in
the
reign
of
hezekiah
and
continued
under
manasseh
resulted
in
the
production
of
a
literature
of
which
fragments
have
been
incorporated
into
the
historical
books
of
our
bible
the
reign
of
amon
witnessed
no
alteration
in
the
policy
initiated
by
his
predecessor
manasseh
but
when
after
less
than
two
rule
he
was
suddenly
struck
down
by
the
knife
of
an
assassin
the
party
of
reform
carried
the
day
and
the
views
of
hezekiah
and
isaiah
regained
their
ascendency
josiah
had
been
king
in
name
at
any
rate
for
twelve
years
and
was
learning
to
act
on
his
own
responsibility
when
the
scythian
danger
appeared
on
the
horizon
the
scheme
of
the
present
work
prevents
me
from
doing
more
than
allude
in
passing
to
these
preliminary
stages
in
the
composition
of
the
priestly
code
i
shall
have
occasion
to
return
briefly
to
the
subject
at
the
close
of
volume
ix
the
date
is
supplied
by
the
opening
passage
of
the
prophecy
of
jeremiah
whom
the
word
of
jehovah
came
in
the
days
of
josiah
the
son
of
amon
king
of
judah
in
the
thirteenth
year
of
his
i
volney
recognised
that
chaps
and
vi
of
jeremiah
refer
to
the
scythian
invasion
and
since
his
time
it
has
been
admitted
that
with
the
exception
of
certain
interpolations
in
chaps
and
the
whole
of
the
first
six
chapters
date
from
this
period
but
that
they
underwent
slight
modifications
in
the
recension
which
was
made
in
the
fourth
year
of
jehoiachin
in
order
to
make
them
applicable
to
the
threatened
chaldæan
invasion
the
date
is
important
since
by
using
it
as
a
basis
we
can
approximately
restore
the
chronology
of
the
whole
period
if
we
assume
the
thirteenth
year
of
josiah
to
have
been
we
are
compelled
to
place
all
the
early
medic
wars
in
the
reign
of
as
i
have
done
this
barbarian
invasion
which
burst
upon
the
peace
of
assyria
like
a
thunderbolt
from
a
cloudless
sky
restored
to
the
faithful
that
confidence
in
the
omnipotence
of
their
god
which
had
seemed
about
to
fail
them
when
they
beheld
the
downfall
of
states
the
sack
of
provinces
innumerable
whole
provinces
in
flames
and
whole
peoples
irresistibly
swept
away
to
death
or
slavery
they
began
to
ask
themselves
whether
these
were
not
signs
of
the
divine
wrath
indicating
that
the
day
of
jahveh
was
at
hand
prophets
arose
to
announce
the
approaching
judgment
among
the
rest
a
certain
zephaniah
a
of
hezekiah
will
utterly
consume
all
things
from
off
the
face
of
the
ground
saith
jahveh
i
will
consume
man
and
beast
i
will
consume
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
and
the
fishes
of
the
sea
and
the
with
the
wicked
and
i
will
cut
off
man
from
the
face
of
the
earth
saith
jahveh
and
i
will
stretch
out
my
hand
upon
judah
and
upon
all
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
and
i
will
cut
off
the
remnant
of
baal
from
this
place
and
the
name
of
the
chemarim
with
the
priests
and
them
that
worship
the
host
of
heaven
upon
the
housetops
and
them
that
worship
which
swear
to
jahveh
and
swear
by
malcham
and
them
that
are
turned
back
from
following
jahveh
and
those
that
have
not
sought
jahveh
nor
inquired
after
him
hold
thy
peace
at
the
presence
of
the
lord
jahveh
for
the
day
of
jahveh
is
at
hand
for
jahveh
hath
prepared
a
sacrifice
he
hath
sanctified
his
zephaniah
gives
his
own
genealogy
at
the
beginning
of
his
prophecy
i
though
it
is
true
he
does
not
add
the
title
of
after
the
name
of
his
ancestor
hezekiah
day
is
a
day
of
wrath
a
day
of
trouble
and
distress
a
day
of
wasteness
and
desolation
a
day
of
darkness
and
gloominess
a
day
of
clouds
and
thick
darkness
a
day
of
the
trumpet
and
alarm
against
the
fenced
cities
and
against
the
high
battlements
and
i
will
bring
distress
upon
men
that
they
shall
walk
like
blind
men
because
they
have
sinned
against
jahveh
and
their
blood
shall
be
poured
out
as
dust
and
their
flesh
as
dung
neither
their
silver
nor
their
gold
shall
be
able
to
deliver
them
in
the
day
of
wrath
but
the
whole
land
shall
be
devoured
by
the
fire
of
his
jealousy
for
he
shall
make
an
end
yea
a
terrible
end
of
all
them
that
dwell
in
the
during
this
same
period
of
stress
and
terror
there
came
forward
another
prophet
one
of
the
greatest
among
the
prophets
of
israel
jeremiah
son
of
hilkiah
he
was
born
in
the
village
of
anathoth
near
jerusalem
being
descended
from
one
of
those
priestly
families
in
which
the
faith
had
been
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
in
all
its
original
purity
the
descent
and
birthplace
of
jeremiah
are
given
at
the
beginning
of
his
prophecies
i
he
must
have
been
quite
young
in
the
thirteenth
year
of
josiah
as
is
evident
from
the
statement
in
i
we
are
told
in
chap
xxxvi
that
in
the
fourth
year
of
jehoiakim
he
dictated
a
summary
of
all
the
prophecies
delivered
by
him
from
the
thirteenth
year
of
josiah
up
to
the
date
indicated
to
his
servant
baruch
and
that
later
on
he
added
a
number
of
others
of
the
same
kind
when
jahveh
called
him
he
cried
out
in
amazement
lord
god
behold
i
can
not
speak
for
i
am
a
but
jahveh
reassured
him
and
touching
his
lips
said
unto
him
i
have
put
my
words
in
thy
mouth
see
i
have
this
day
set
thee
over
the
nations
and
over
the
kingdoms
to
pluck
up
and
to
break
down
and
to
destroy
and
to
overthrow
to
build
and
to
then
the
prophet
perceived
a
seething
cauldron
the
face
of
which
appeared
from
the
north
for
the
eternal
declared
to
him
that
of
the
north
evil
shall
break
out
upon
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
already
the
enemy
is
hastening
he
shall
come
up
as
clouds
and
his
chariots
shall
be
as
the
whirlwind
his
horses
are
swifter
than
eagles
woe
unto
us
for
we
are
spoiled
o
jerusalem
wash
thine
heart
from
wickedness
that
thou
mayest
be
saved
how
long
shall
thine
evil
thoughts
lodge
within
thee
for
a
voice
declareth
from
dan
and
publisheth
evil
from
the
hills
of
ephraim
make
ye
mention
to
the
nations
behold
publish
against
jerusalem
the
scythians
had
hardly
been
mentioned
before
they
were
already
beneath
the
walls
and
the
prophet
almost
swoons
with
horror
at
the
sound
of
their
approach
bowels
my
bowels
i
am
pained
at
my
very
heart
my
heart
is
disquieted
in
me
i
can
not
hold
my
peace
because
thou
hast
heard
o
my
soul
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
the
alarm
of
war
destruction
upon
destruction
is
cried
for
the
whole
land
is
spoiled
and
my
curtains
in
a
moment
how
long
shall
i
see
the
standard
and
hear
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
it
would
seem
that
the
torrent
of
invasion
turned
aside
from
the
mountains
of
judah
it
flowed
over
galilee
samaria
and
the
philistine
shephelah
its
last
eddies
dying
away
on
the
frontiers
of
egypt
psammetiehus
is
said
to
have
bribed
the
barbarians
to
retire
as
they
fell
back
they
plundered
the
temple
of
derketô
near
ashkelon
we
are
told
that
in
order
to
punish
them
for
this
act
of
sacrilege
the
goddess
visited
them
with
a
disease
which
caused
serious
ravages
amongst
them
and
which
the
survivors
carried
back
with
them
to
their
own
country
herodotus
calls
the
goddess
aphrodite
urania
by
which
we
must
understand
derketô
or
atargatis
who
is
mentioned
by
several
other
classical
authors
xanthus
of
lydia
diodorus
siculus
strabo
pliny
according
to
justin
the
scythians
were
stopped
only
by
the
marshes
of
the
delta
the
disease
by
which
the
scythians
were
attacked
is
described
by
hippocrates
but
in
spite
of
what
he
tells
us
about
it
its
precise
nature
has
not
yet
been
determined
there
was
however
no
need
to
introduce
a
supernatural
agency
in
order
to
account
for
their
rapid
disappearance
the
main
body
of
invaders
had
never
quitted
media
or
the
northern
part
of
the
assyrian
empire
and
only
the
southern
regions
of
syria
were
in
all
probability
exposed
to
the
attacks
of
isolated
bands
these
stragglers
who
year
after
year
embarked
in
one
desperate
adventure
after
another
must
have
found
great
difficulty
in
filling
up
the
gaps
which
even
victories
made
in
their
ranks
enervated
by
the
relaxing
nature
of
the
climate
they
could
offer
little
resistance
to
disease
and
excess
completed
what
the
climate
had
begun
the
result
being
that
most
of
them
died
on
the
way
and
only
a
few
survived
to
rejoin
the
main
body
with
their
booty
for
several
months
the
tide
of
invasion
continued
to
rise
then
it
ebbed
as
quickly
as
it
had
risen
till
soon
nothing
was
left
to
mark
where
it
had
passed
save
a
pathway
of
ruins
not
easily
made
good
and
a
feeling
of
terror
which
it
took
many
a
year
to
efface
it
was
long
before
judah
forgot
the
nation
the
ancient
nation
the
nation
whose
language
thou
knowest
not
neither
understandest
thou
what
they
men
could
still
picture
in
imagination
their
squadrons
marauding
over
the
plains
robbing
the
fellah
of
his
crops
his
bread
his
daughters
his
sheep
and
oxen
his
vines
and
fig
trees
for
lay
hold
on
bow
and
spear
they
are
cruel
and
have
no
mercy
their
voice
roareth
like
the
sea
and
they
ride
upon
horses
every
one
set
in
array
as
a
man
to
the
battle
against
thee
o
daughter
of
sion
we
have
heard
the
fame
thereof
our
hands
wax
feeble
anguish
hath
taken
hold
of
us
and
pangs
as
of
a
woman
in
the
supremacy
of
the
scythians
was
of
short
duration
it
was
said
in
that
they
had
kept
the
whole
of
asia
in
a
state
of
terror
for
years
dating
from
their
defeat
of
cyaxares
but
the
length
of
this
period
is
exaggerated
jer
it
seems
curious
that
the
hebrew
prophet
should
use
the
epithet
when
we
remember
that
the
scythians
claimed
to
be
the
oldest
nation
in
the
world
older
than
even
the
egyptians
themselves
an
obvious
allusion
to
the
regular
formation
adopted
by
the
scythian
squadrons
jer
vi
the
authenticity
of
the
number
of
years
given
in
herodotus
has
been
energetically
defended
by
some
modern
historians
and
not
less
forcibly
denied
by
others
who
reduce
it
for
example
in
accordance
with
a
doubtful
passage
of
justin
to
eight
years
by
assigning
all
the
events
relating
to
the
scythian
invaders
to
the
mean
period
of
twenty
years
we
should
obtain
the
length
of
time
which
best
corresponds
to
what
is
actually
known
of
the
general
history
of
this
epoch
the
medes
soon
recovered
from
their
disaster
but
before
engaging
their
foes
in
open
conflict
they
desired
to
rid
themselves
of
the
prince
who
had
conquered
them
and
on
whom
the
fortunes
of
the
whole
scythian
nation
depended
cyaxares
therefore
invited
madyes
and
his
officers
to
a
banquet
and
after
plying
them
to
excess
with
meat
and
drink
he
caused
them
all
to
be
slain
this
episode
is
regarded
as
legendary
by
many
modern
historians
winckler
even
goes
so
far
as
to
deny
the
defeat
of
the
scythians
according
to
his
view
they
held
possession
of
media
till
their
chief
astyages
was
overthrown
by
cyrus
rost
has
gone
even
further
deeming
even
cyaxares
himself
to
have
been
a
scythian
for
my
part
i
see
no
reason
to
reject
the
tradition
of
the
fatal
banquet
without
referring
to
more
ancient
illustrations
noldeke
recalls
the
fact
that
in
a
period
of
only
ten
years
from
to
the
princes
reigning
over
the
iranian
lands
rid
themselves
by
similar
methods
of
the
turcoman
bands
which
harassed
them
such
a
proceeding
has
never
been
repugnant
to
oriental
morality
and
it
is
of
a
kind
to
fix
itself
in
the
popular
mind
far
from
wishing
to
suppress
it
i
should
be
inclined
to
see
in
it
the
nucleus
of
the
whole
tradition
the
barbarians
made
a
brave
resistance
in
spite
of
the
treason
which
had
deprived
them
of
their
leaders
they
yielded
only
after
a
long
and
bloody
campaign
the
details
of
which
are
unknown
to
us
iranian
legends
wove
into
the
theme
of
their
expulsion
all
kinds
of
fantastic
or
romantic
incidents
they
related
for
instance
how
in
combination
with
the
parthians
the
scythians
under
the
leadership
of
their
queen
zarinsea
several
times
defeated
the
medes
she
consented
at
last
to
conclude
a
treaty
on
equal
terms
and
peace
having
been
signed
she
retired
to
her
capital
of
boxanakê
there
to
end
her
days
one
body
of
the
survivors
europe
through
the
caspian
gates
another
wandered
for
some
time
between
the
araxes
and
the
halys
seeking
a
country
adapted
to
their
native
instincts
and
customs
cyaxares
relieved
from
the
pressure
put
upon
him
by
the
scythians
immediately
resumed
his
efforts
against
assyria
and
was
henceforward
able
to
carry
his
plans
to
completion
without
encountering
any
serious
obstacle
it
would
be
incorrect
to
say
that
the
scythian
invasion
had
overthrown
the
empire
of
the
sargonids
it
had
swept
over
it
like
a
whirlwind
but
had
not
torn
from
it
one
province
nor
indeed
even
a
single
city
the
nations
already
exhausted
by
their
struggles
for
independence
were
incapable
of
displaying
any
energy
when
the
barbarians
had
withdrawn
and
continued
to
bow
beneath
the
ninevite
yoke
as
much
from
familiarity
with
habitual
servitude
as
from
inability
to
shake
themselves
free
had
died
about
the
year
after
a
reign
of
years
and
his
son
had
assumed
the
double
crown
of
assyria
and
babylon
without
opposition
herodotus
speaks
of
these
scythians
as
having
lived
at
first
on
good
terms
with
cyaxares
the
date
of
death
is
not
furnished
by
any
assyrian
monument
but
is
inferred
from
the
canon
of
ptolemy
where
saosduchîn
or
and
chinaladan
or
each
reigns
years
from
or
to
or
the
order
of
succession
of
the
last
assyrian
kings
was
for
a
long
time
doubtful
and
ishkun
was
placed
before
the
inverse
order
seems
to
be
now
conclusively
proved
the
documents
which
seemed
at
one
time
to
prove
the
existence
of
a
last
king
of
assyria
named
esarhaddon
identical
with
the
saracos
of
classical
writers
really
belong
to
esarhaddon
the
father
of
another
king

mentioned
in
a
contract
dated
at
nippur
in
his
accession

he
may
have
been
the
immediate
predecessor

strength

reduced

they
were

few
wretched
remnants

some
feeble
attempts
to
restore
to
them

semblance
of
their
ancient
splendour
he
erected
at
calah
on
the
site
of
the
palaces
which
had
been
destroyed
by
fire
a
kind
of
castle
rudely
built
and
still
more
rudely
decorated
the
rooms
of
which
were
small
and
low
and
the
walls
of

were
panelled
only
to
the
height
of
about
a
yard
with
slabs
of
limestone
roughly
squared
and
without
sculpture
or
inscription

upper
part
of
the

covered
with
a
coating
of
uneven
plaster

do
not

inglorious
reign
of
lasted
nor
whether
he
was
assassinated
or
died
a
natural
death
his
brother
who
succeeded
him
about
at
first
exercised
authority
as
he
had
done
over
babylon
as
well
as
nineveh
and
laboured
like
his
predecessor
to
repair
the
edifices
which
had
suffered
by
the
invasion
making
war
on
his
neighbours
perhaps
even
on
the
medes
without
incurring
serious
losses
the
name
of
this
king
was
discovered
by
smith
on
the
fragments
of
a
cylinder
brought
from
kouyunjik
where
he
read
it
as
the
real
reading
is
ishkun
and
the
similarity
of
this
name
with
that
of
saracos
the
last
king
of
assyria
according
to
greek
tradition
strikes
one
immediately
the
relationship
of
this
king
to
was
pointed
out
by
father
scheil
from
the
fragment
of
a
tablet
on
which
is
declared
to
be
the
son
of
king
of
assyria
this
may
be
deduced
from
a
passage
of
abydenus
where
saracos
or
sends
bussalossoros
that
is
nabopolassar
to
defend
chaldæ
against
the
invasion
of
the
peoples
of
the
sea
so
according
to
abydenus
or
rather
berosus
from
whom
abydenus
indirectly
obtained
his
information
saracos
was
king
of
babylon
as
well
as
of
nineveh
at
the
beginning
of
his
reign
the
chaldæans
however
merely
yielded
him
obedience
from
force
of
habit
and
the
moment
was
not
far
distant
when
they
would
endeavour
to
throw
off
his
yoke
babylon
was
at
that
time
under
the
rule
of
a
certain
known
to
us
as
nabopolassar
a
kaldu
of
ancient
lineage
raised
possibly
by
to
the
dignity
of
governor
but
who
in
any
case
had
assumed
the
title
of
king
on
the
accession
of
the
canon
of
ptolemy
makes
nabopolassar
the
direct
successor
of
chinaladan
and
his
testimony
is
justified
by
the
series
of
babylonian
contracts
which
exist
in
fairly
regular
succession
from
the
second
to
the
years
of
nabopolassar
the
account
given
by
berosus
makes
him
a
general
of
saracos
but
the
contradiction
which
this
offers
to
the
testimony
of
the
canon
can
be
explained
if
he
is
considered
as
a
the
kings
of
egypt
and
of
media
were
likewise
only
satraps
according
to
babylonian
tradition
his
was
but
a
local
sovereignty
restricted
probably
to
the
city
and
its
environs
and
for
twelve
or
thirteen
years
he
had
rested
content
with
this
secondary
position
when
an
unforeseen
incident
presented
him
with
the
opportunity
of
rising
to
the
first
rank
tradition
asserted
that
an
immense
army
suddenly
landed
at
the
mouths
of
the
euphrates
and
the
tigris
probably
under
this
story
is
concealed
the
memory
of
one
of
those
revolts
of
the
and
the
tribes
dwelling
on
the
shores
of
the
such
as
had
often
produced
consternation
in
the
minds
of
the
sargonid
kings
distracted
doubtless
by
other
anxieties
acted
as
his
ancestors
had
done
in
similar
circumstances
and
enjoined
on
his
vassal
to
march
against
the
aggressors
and
drive
them
into
the
sea
but
nabopolassar
instead
of
obeying
his
suzerain
joined
forces
with
the
rebels
and
declared
his
independence
and
his
younger
brother
had
possibly
neglected
to
take
the
hands
of
bel
and
were
therefore
looked
upon
as
illegitimate
sovereigns
the
annalists
of
later
times
erased
their
names
from
the
royal
canon
and
placed
nabopolassar
immediately
after
whom
they
called
kandalanu
but
however
feeble
assyria
had
become
the
cities
on
the
lower
euphrates
feared
her
still
and
refused
to
ally
themselves
with
the
pretender
nabopolassar
might
perhaps
have
succumbed
as
so
many
before
him
had
done
had
he
been
forced
to
rely
entirely
on
his
own
resources
and
he
might
have
shared
the
sad
fate
of
or
of
but
marduk
who
never
failed
to
show
favour
to
his
faithful
devotees
up
help
for
him
and
secured
him
an
the
eyes
of
all
who
were
oppressed
by
the
cruel
yoke
of
nineveh
were
now
turned
on
cyaxares
and
from
the
time
that
he
had
dispersed
the
scythian
hordes
it
was
to
him
that
they
looked
for
salvation
nabopolassar
besought
his
assistance
which
the
median
king
graciously
promised
it
is
even
affirmed
that
a
marriage
concluded
between
one
of
his
daughters
amyfcis
and
nebuchadrezzar
the
heir
to
the
throne
of
babylon
cemented
the
alliance
formerly
these
barbarians
were
identified
with
the
remains
of
the
scythian
hordes
and
this
hypothesis
has
been
recently
revived
by
prashek
rawlinson
long
ago
recognised
that
the
reference
must
be
to
the
chaldæans
who
were
perhaps
joined
by
the
susians
the
of
the
only
original
document
in
which
allusion
is
made
to
the
destruction
of
nineveh
speaks
of
the
and
their
king
whom
it
does
not
name
and
it
has
been
agreed
to
recognise
cyaxares
in
this
sovereign
on
the
other
hand
the
name
of
certainly
designates
in
the
assyrian
texts
the
wandering
iranian
tribes
to
whom
the
greeks
gave
the
name
of
sakse
or
scythians
the
result
in
the
opinions
of
several
assyriologists
of
the
present
day
is
that
neither
astyages
nor
cyaxares
were
medes
in
the
sense
in
which
we
have
hitherto
accepted
them
as
such
on
the
evidence
of
herodotus
but
that
they
were
scythians
the
scythians
of
the
great
invasion
this
conclusion
does
not
seem
to
me
at
present
justified
the
babylonians
who
up
till
then
had
not
had
any
direct
intercourse
either
with
the
madai
or
the
did
as
the
egyptians
had
done
whether
in
saite
or
ptolemaic
times
continuing
to
designate
as
kharî
kafîti
lotanu
and
khâti
the
nations
subject
to
the
persians
or
macedonians
they
applied
a
traditional
name
of
olden
days
to
present
circumstances
and
i
see
at
present
no
decisive
reason
to
change
on
the
mere
authority
of
this
one
word
all
that
the
classical
writers
have
handed
down
concerning
the
history
of
the
epoch
according
to
the
tradition
current
in
their
days
the
name
of
the
princess
is
written
amuhia
amyitis
the
classical
sources
the
only
ones
which
mention
her
make
her
the
daughter
of
astyages
and
this
has
given
rise
to
various
hypotheses
according
to
some
the
notice
of
this
princess
has
no
historical
value
according
to
others
the
astyages
mentioned
as
her
father
is
not
cyaxares
the
mede
but
a
scythian
prince
who
came
to
the
succour
of
nabopolassar
perhaps
a
predecessor
of
cyaxares
on
the
median
throne
and
in
this
case
phraortes
himself
under
another
name
the
most
prudent
course
is
still
to
admit
that
abydenus
or
one
of
the
compilers
of
extracts
to
whom
we
owe
the
information
has
substituted
the
name
of
the
last
king
of
media
for
that
of
his
predecessor
either
by
mistake
or
by
reason
of
some
chronological
combinations
amyitis
transported
into
the
harem
of
the
chaldæan
monarch
served
like
all
princesses
married
out
of
their
own
countries
as
a
pledge
for
the
faithful
observance
by
her
relatives
of
the
treaty
which
had
been
concluded
the
western
provinces
of
the
empire
did
not
permit
themselves
to
be
drawn
into
the
movement
and
judah
for
example
remained
faithful
to
its
suzerain
till
the
last
moment
but
received
no
help
from
them
and
was
obliged
to
fight
his
last
battles
he
shut
himself
up
in
nineveh
and
held
out
as
long
as
he
could
but
when
all
his
resources
were
exhausted
ammunitions
of
war
men
and
food
supplies
he
met
his
fate
as
a
king
and
burnt
himself
alive
in
his
palace
with
his
children
and
his
wives
rather
than
fall
alive
into
the
hands
of
his
conquerors
the
babylonians
would
take
no
part
in
pillaging
the
temples
out
of
respect
for
the
gods
who
were
practically
identical
with
their
own
but
the
medes
felt
no
such
scruples
king
the
intrepid
one
entirely
destroyed
the
sanctuaries
of
the
gods
of
assur
and
the
cities
of
accad
which
had
shown
themselves
hostile
to
the
lord
of
accad
and
had
not
rendered
him
assistance
he
destroyed
their
holy
places
and
left
not
one
remaining
he
devastated
their
cities
and
laid
them
waste
as
it
were
with
a
nineveh
laid
low
assyria
no
longer
existed
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
years
she
was
named
only
among
the
legends
of
mythical
days
two
centuries
later
her
very
site
was
forgotten
and
a
greek
army
passed
almost
under
the
shadow
of
her
dismantled
towers
without
a
suspicion
that
there
lay
before
it
all
that
remained
of
the
city
where
semiramis
had
reigned
in
her
glory
it
was
to
oppose
the
march
of
necho

king

that
josiah
fought
the
battle
of
megiddo
kings
xxiii
cf
chron
xxxv
where
the
mention
of
the
king
of
assyria
is
suppressed
this
is
what
the
did
when
they
passed
before
larissa
and
mespila
the
name
remained
famous
and
later
on
the
town
which
bore
it
attained
a
relative
importance
it
is
true
that
egypt
chaldæa
and
the
other
military
nations
of
the
east
had
never
in
their
hours
of
prosperity
shown
the
slightest
consideration
for
their
vanquished
foes
the
theban
pharaohs
had
mercilessly
crushed
africa
and
asia
beneath
their
feet
and
had
led
into
slavery
the
entire
population
of
the
countries
they
had
subdued
but
the
egyptians
and
chaldaeans
had
at
least
accomplished
a
work
of
civilization
whose
splendour
redeemed
the
brutalities
of
their
acts
of
reprisal
it
was
from
egypt
and
chaldæa
that
the
knowledge
and
the
arts
of
antiquity
astronomy
medicine
geometry
physical
and
natural
sciences
spread
to
the
ancestors
of
the
classic
races
and
though
chaldæa
yields
up
to
us
unwillingly
with
niggard
hand
the
monuments
of
her
most
ancient
kings
the
temples
and
tombs
of
egypt
still
exist
to
prove
what
signal
advances
the
earliest
civilised
races
made
in
the
arts
of
the
sculptor
and
the
architect
but
on
turning
to
assyria
if
after
patiently
studying
the
successive
centuries
during
which
she
held
supreme
sway
over
the
eastern
world
we
look
for
other
results
besides
her
conquests
we
shall
find
she
possessed
nothing
that
was
not
borrowed
from
extraneous
sources
she
received
all
her
inspirations
from
chaldæa
her
civilisation
her
manners
the
implements
of
her
industries
and
of
agriculture
besides
her
scientific
and
religious
literature
one
thing
alone
is
of
native
growth
the
military
tactics
of
her
generals
and
the
excellence
of
her
soldiery
from
the
day
when
assyria
first
realised
her
own
strength
she
lived
only
for
war
and
rapine
and
as
soon
as
the
exhaustion
of
her
population
rendered
success
on
the
field
of
battle
an
impossibility
the
reason
for
her
very
existence
vanished
and
she
passed
away
two
great
kingdoms
rose
simultaneously
from
her
ruins
cyaxares
claimed
assyria
proper
and
its
dependencies
on
the
upper
tigris
but
he
specially
reserved
for
himself
the
yet
unconquered
lands
on
the
northern
and
eastern
frontiers
whose
inhabitants
had
only
recently
taken
part
in
the
political
life
of
the
times
nabopolassar
retained
the
suzerainty
over
the
lowlands
of
elam
the
districts
of
mesopotamia
lying
along
the
euphrates
syria
palestine
and
most
of
the
countries
which
had
hitherto
played
a
part
in
history
he
claimed
to
exert
his
supremacy
beyond
the
isthmus
and
the
chaldæan
government
looked
upon
the
egyptian
kings
as
its
feudatories
because
for
some
few
years
they
had
owned
the
suzerainty
of
nineveh
there
was
no
actual
division
of
the
empire
as
has
been
often
asserted
but
each
of
the
allies
kept
the
portion
which
fell
into
his
power
at
the
moment
of
their
joint
effort
the
two
new
states
gradually
increased
in
power
by
successive
conquests
each
annexing
by
degrees
the
ancient
provinces
of
assyria
nearest
to
its
own
frontier
this
seems
to
be
implied
by
the
terms
in
which
berosus
speaks
of
necho
he
considers
him
as
a
rebel
satrap
over
the
provinces
of
egypt
and
phoenicia
and
enumerates
egypt
in
conjunction
with
syria
phoenicia
and
arabia
among
the
dependencies
of
nabopolassar
and
nebuchadrezzar
just
as
the
egyptian
state
documents
never
mentioned
the
lotanu
or
the
kharu
without
entitling
them
of
so
the
chaldæan
government
the
heir
of
assyria
could
only
look
upon
the
kings
of
syria
arabia
and
egypt
as
rebellious
vassals
illustration
map
of
the
eastern
world
in
the
time
of
nebuchadnezzar
the
pharaoh
however
did
not
long
tolerate
this
pretension
and
far
from
looking
forward
to
bend
the
knee
before
a
chaldæan
monarch
he
believed
himself
strong
enough
to
reassert
his
ancestral
claims
to
the
possession
of
asia
egypt
had
experienced
many
changes
since
the
day
when
tanuatamanu
returning
to
ethiopia
had
abandoned
her
to
the
ambition
of
the
petty
dynasties
of
the
delta
one
of
the
romances
current
among
the
people
of
sais
in
the
fifth
century
related
that
at
that
time
the
whole
land
was
divided
between
twelve
princes
they
lived
peaceably
side
by
side
in
friendly
relations
with
each
other
until
an
oracle
predicted
that
the
whole
valley
would
finally
belong
to
that
prince
among
them
who
should
pour
a
libation
to
phtah
into
a
brazen
cup
and
thenceforward
they
jealously
watched
each
other
each
time
they
assembled
to
officiate
in
the
temple
of
memphis
one
day
when
they
had
met
together
in
state
and
the
high
priest
presented
to
them
the
golden
cups
they
were
wont
to
use
he
found
he
had
mistaken
their
number
and
had
only
prepared
eleven
psammetichus
was
therefore
left
without
one
and
in
order
not
to
disarrange
the
ceremonial
he
took
off
his
brazen
helmet
and
used
it
to
make
his
libation
when
the
rest
perceived
this
the
words
of
the
oracle
came
to
their
remembrance
and
they
exiled
the
imprudent
prince
to
the
marshes
along
the
and
forbade
him
ever
to
quit
them
he
secretly
consulted
the
oracle
of
isis
of
buto
to
know
what
he
might
expect
from
the
gods
and
she
replied
that
the
means
of
revenge
would
reach
him
from
the
sea
on
the
day
when
brazen
soldiers
should
issue
from
its
waters
he
thought
at
first
that
the
priests
were
mocking
him
but
shortly
afterwards
ionian
and
carian
pirates
clad
in
their
coats
of
mail
landed
not
far
from
his
abode
the
messenger
who
brought
tidings
of
their
advent
had
never
before
seen
a
soldier
fully
armed
and
reported
that
brazen
men
had
issued
from
the
waves
and
were
pillaging
the
country
psammetichus
realising
at
once
that
the
prediction
was
being
fulfilled
ran
to
meet
the
strangers
enrolled
them
in
his
service
and
with
their
aid
overthrew
successively
his
eleven
rivals
the
account
given
by
diodorus
of
these
events
is
in
general
derived
from
that
of
herodotus
with
additional
details
borrowed
directly
or
indirectly
from
some
historian
of
the
same
epoch
perhaps
hellanicus
of
mitylene
the
reason
of
the
persecution
endured
by
psammetichus
is
according
to
him
not
the
fear
of
seeing
the
prediction
fulfilled
but
jealousy
of
the
wealth
the
saite
prince
had
acquired
by
his
commerce
with
the
greeks
i
have
separated
the
narrative
of
herodotus
from
his
account
of
the
labyrinth
which
did
not
originally
belong
to
it
but
was
connected
with
a
different
cycle
of
legends
the
original
romance
was
part
of
the
cycle
which
grew
up
around
the
oracle
of
buto
so
celebrated
in
egypt
at
the
persian
epoch
several
other
fragments
of
which
are
preserved
in
herodotus
it
had
been
mixed
up
with
one
of
the
versions
of
the
stories
relating
to
the
labyrinth
probably
by
some
dragoman
of
the
fayyûm
the
number
twelve
does
not
correspond
with
the
information
furnished
by
the
assyrian
texts
which
enumerate
more
than
twenty
egyptian
princes
it
is
perhaps
of
greek
origin
like
the
great
gods
which
the
informants
of
herodotus
tried
to
make
out
in
egypt
and
was
introduced
into
the
egyptian
version
by
a
greek
interpreter
a
brazen
helmet
and
an
oracle
had
dethroned
him
another
oracle
and
brazen
men
had
replaced
him
on
his
throne
a
shorter
version
of
these
events
made
no
mention
of
the
twelve
kings
but
related
instead
that
a
certain
pharaoh
named

day

learned
by

had
been

to
wear

he
recalled
at

the
words
of
the
oracle
and
hired
from

a
number
of
these
with
whose
assistance
he
revolted

history

and
precisely
known
egypt
was
in
a
state
of
complete
disintegration
when
psammetichus
at
length
revived
the
ambitious
projects
of
his
family
but
the
dissolution
of
the
various
component
parts
had
not
everywhere
taken
place
in
the
same
manner

archaic
in
the

in
the
north
the

and
the

as
far
as
siut
were
in
the
power
of
a
military
aristocracy
supported
by
irregular
native
troops
and
bands
of
mercenaries
for
the
most
part
of
libyan
extraction
who
were
always
designated
by
the
generic
name
of
mashauasha
most
of
these
nobles
were
in
possession
of
not
more
than
two
or
three
cities
apiece
they
had
barely
a
sufficient
number
of
supporters
to
maintain
their
precarious
existence
in
their
restricted
domains
and
would
soon
have
succumbed
to
the
attacks
of
their
stronger
neighbours
had
they
not
found
a
powerful
protector
to
assist
them
they
had
finally
separated
themselves
into
two
groups
divided
roughly
by
the
central
arm
of
the
nile
one
group
comprised
the
districts
that
might
be
designated
as
the
asiatic
zone
of
the
country
heliopolis
bubastis
mendes
tanis
busiris
and
and
it
recognised
as
chief
the
lord
of
one
or
other
of
those
wealthy
cities
now
the
ruler
of
bubastis
now
of
tanis
and
lastly
pakruru
of
pisaptit
the
second
group
centred
in
the
lords
of
sais
to
whom
the
possession
of
memphis
had
secured
a
preponderating
voice
in
the
counsels
of
the
state
for
more
than
a
century
this
grouping
which
might
already
have
been
suspected
from
the
manner
in
which
the
assyrian
and
egyptian
monuments
of
the
period
show
us
the
feudal
princes
rallying
round
necho
and
pakruru
is
indicated
by
the
details
in
the
demotic
romance
published
by
krall
where
the
foundation
of
the
story
is
the
state
of
egypt
in
the
time
of
the
the
fiefs
and
kingdoms
of
middle
egypt
wavered
between
the
two
groups
playing
however
a
merely
passive
part
in
affairs
abandoning
themselves
to
the
stream
of
events
rather
than
attempting
to
direct
it
they
owed
allegiance
to
sais
and
tanis
alternately
as
each
prevailed
over
its
rival
on
passing
thence
into
the
thebaid
a
different
world
appeared
to
be
entered
there
amon
reigned
ever
increasingly
supreme
and
the
steady
advance
of
his
influence
had
transformed
his
whole
domain
into
a
regular
theocracy
where
the
women
occupied
the
highest
position
and
could
alone
transmit
authority
at
first
as
we
have
seen
it
was
passed
on
to
their
husbands
and
their
children
but
latterly
the
rapidity
with
which
the
valley
had
changed
masters
had
modified
this
law
of
succession
in
a
remarkable
way
each
time
the
principality
shifted
its
allegiance
from
one
king
to
another
the
new
sovereign
naturally
hastened
to
install
beside
the
female
a
man
devoted
to
his
interests
who
should
administer
the
fief
to
the
best
advantage
of
the
suzerain
it
is
impossible
to
say
whether
he
actually
imposed
this
minister
on
her
as
a
husband
or
whether
the
time
came
when
she
was
obliged
to
submit
to
as
many
espousals
as
there
occurred
revolutions
in
the
destinies
of
egypt
however
this
may
be
we
know
that
from
the
first
half
of
the
seventh
century
the
custom
arose
of
placing
beside
divine
a
princess
of
the
dominant
family
whom
she
adopted
and
who
thus
became
her
taharqa
had
in
this
way
associated
one
of
his
sisters
shapenuapît
with
the
queen
amenertas
when
the
latter
had
lost
her
husband
piônkhi
and
shapenuapît
succeeding
her
adopted
mother
had
reigned
over
thebes
in
the
ethiopian
interest
during
many
years
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
she
was
married
and
perhaps
she
was
compensated
for
her
official
celibacy
by
being
authorised
to
live
the
free
life
of
an
ordinary
pallacide
her
minister
montumihâît
directed
her
affairs
for
her
so
completely
that
the
assyrian
conquerors
looked
upon
him
as
petty
king
of
thebes
tanuatamanu
confirmed
him
in
his
office
when
the
assyrians
evacuated
the
said
and
the
few
years
which
had
elapsed
since
that
event
had
in
no
way
modified
the
established
immediately
on
their
departure
they
would
have
been
in
fact
in
the
same
condition
as
the
hova
queens
of
our
century
who
married
the
ministers
who
reigned
in
their
names
it
is
perhaps
these
last
female
descendants
of
the
high
priests
that
are
intended
in
a
passage
where
strabo
speaks
of
the
pallacides
who
were
chosen
from
among
the
most
noble
families
of
the
city
diodorus
mentions
their
tombs
quoting
from
hecatous
of
abdera
but
he
does
not
appear
to
know
the
nature
of
their
life
but
the
name
of
pallacides
which
he
applies
to
them
proves
that
their
manner
of
life
was
really
that
which
strabo
describes
it
is
uncertain
how
long
in
the
north
and
tanuatamanu
in
the
south
respectively
maintained
a
precarious
sovereignty
over
the
portions
of
egypt
nearest
to
their
own
capitals

the
opening
of

seems
to
have
been
fraught
with
difficulties

the
tradition
which
represents
him
as
proscribed
by
his
peers

confined
to
the

of
the
has
probably
a
certain
basis
of
truth
pakruru
who
had
brought
all
the
western
part
of
the
delta
under
his
own
influence
and
who
incessantly
oscillating
between
assyria
and
ethiopia
had
yet
been
able
to
preserve
his
power
and
his
life
had
certainly
not
of
his
own
free
will
renounced
the
hope
of
some
day
wearing
the
double
crown
it
was
against
him
or
his
successor
that
psammetichus
must
have
undertaken
his
first
wars
and
it
was
perhaps
with
the
help
of
assyrian
governors
that
the
federal
coalition
drove
him
back
to
the
coast
he
extricated
himself
from
this
untoward
situation
by
the
help
of
greek
and
asiatic
mercenaries
his
ionians
and
carians
some
historians
stated
that
the
decisive
battle
was
fought
near
memphis
in
sight
of
the
temple
of
isis
others
affirmed
that
it
took

at

that
several
of
the
princes
perished
in
the
conflict
and
that
the
rest
escaped
into

they
never
returned
others
again
spoke
of
an
encounter
on
the
nile
when
the
fleet
of
the
saite
king
dispersed
that
of
his
rivals
it
is
in
fact
probable
that
a
single
campaign
sufficed
for
psammetichus
as
formerly
for
the
ethiopian
pretenders
to
get
the
upper
hand
and
that
the
egyptian
feudal
lords
submitted
after
one
or
two
defeats
at
most
hoping
that
as
in
days
gone
by
when
the
first
dash
made
by
the
new
pharaoh
was
over
his
authority
would
decline
and
their
own
would
regain
the
ascendency
events
showed
that
they
were
deceived
psammetichus
better
served
by
his
hellenes
than
tafnakhti
or
bocchoris
had
been
by
their
libyans
or
piônkhi
and
tanuatamanu
by
their
ethiopians
soon
consolidated
his
rule
over
the
country
he
had
conquered
from
or
he
so
effectively
governed
egypt
that
foreigners
and
even
the
assyrians
themselves
commonly
accorded
him
the
title
of
king
the
fall
of
the
ninevite
rule
had
been
involved
in
that
of
the
feudal
lords
but
it
was
generally
believed
that
would
leave
no
means
untried
to
recall
the
countries
of
the
nile
to
their
obedience
psammetichus
knew
this
and
knew
also
that
as
soon
as
they
were
no
longer
detained
by
wars
or
rebellions
elsewhere
the
assyrian
armies
would
reappear
in
egypt
he
therefore
entered
into
an
alliance
with
gyges
and
subsequently
perhaps
with
also
then
while
his
former
suzerain
was
waging
war
in
elam
and
chaldæa
he
turned
southwards
in
and
took
possession
of
the
thebaid
without
encountering
any
opposition
from
the
ethiopians
as
his
ancestor
tafnakhti
had
from
negotiated
this
capitulation
of
thebes
as
he
had
already
negotiated
so
many
others
in
recompense
for
this
service
he
was
confirmed
in
his
office
and
his
queen
retained
her
high
rank
the
annexation
of
the
thebaid
and
the
consequent
pacification
of
egypt
was
an
accomplished
fact
in
the
year
ix
of
psammetichus
i
the
analogy
of
similar
documents
the
stele
of
the
high
priest
menkhopirrî
shows
that
the
ceremony
of
adoption
which
consecrated
the
reunion
of
upper
and
lower
egypt
can
not
have
been
separated
by
a
long
interval
from
the
completion
of
the
reunion
itself
in
placing
this
at
the
end
of
the
year
we
should
have
for
the
two
events
the
respective
dates
of
and
the
part
played
by
montumihâît
in
this
affair
is
easily
deduced
from
our
knowledge
of
his
conduct
some
years
previously
under
taharqa
and
tanuatamanu
from
the
position
he
occupied
at
thebes
in
the
year
with
regard
to
shapenuapît
according
to
the
stele
of
legrain
a
century
or
two
earlier
psammetichus
would
have
married
one
of
the
princesses
of
sacerdotal
lineage
and
this
union
would
have
sufficed
to
legalise
his
position
perhaps
he
actually
associated
shapenuapît
with
himself
by
a
show
of
marriage
but
in
any
case
he
provided
her
with
an
adopted
daughter
according
to
the
custom
instituted
by
the
ethiopian
pharaohs
she
already
had
one
daughter
by
adoption
whom
she
had
received
at
the
hands
of
taharqa
and
who
in
changing
her
family
had
assumed
the
name
of
amenertas
in
honour
of
the
queen
who
had
preceded
shapenuapît
psammetichus
forced
her
to
replace
the
ethiopian
princess
by
one
of
his
own
daughters
who
was
henceforth
called
shapenuapît
after
her
new
mother
a
deputation
of
the
nobles
and
priests

to
escort
the
princess
from
memphis

month

ninth
year
of

her
to
them

ambassadors

listened
to
his
address
expatiated
in
the
customary
eulogies
on

splendour

should

to

that
the

may
there
chant
her
as
soon
as
the
aged
shapenuapît
had
seen
her
coadjutor
loved
her
more
than
all
things
and
assigned
her
a
dowry
the
same
as
that
which
she
had
received
from
her
own
parents
and
which
she
had
granted
to

and

with
each
other
in
their
gifts
of
welcome
psammetichus
on
his
side
had
acted
most
generously
and
the
temples
of
egypt
assigned
to
the
princess
an
annual
income
out
of
their
revenues
or
bestowed
upon
her
grants
of
houses
and
lands
in
all
constituting
a
considerable
inheritance
which
somewhat
consoled
the
thebans
for
their
subjection
to
a
dynasty
emanating
from
the
cities
of
the
north
the
rest
of
the
principality
imitated
the
example
of
thebes
and
the
whole
of
egypt
from
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
to
the
rocks
of
the
first
cataract

more
found
itself
reunited
under
the
sceptre
of
an
egyptian
king
a
small
part
of
nubia
the
portion
nearest
to
elephantine
followed
this
movement
but
the
greater
part
refused
to
cut
itself
off
from
the
ethiopians
these
latter
were
henceforth
confined
to
the
regions
along
the
middle
course
of
the
nile
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
world
by
the
deserts
the
red
sea
and
egypt
it
is
probable
that
they
did
not
give
up
without
a
struggle
the
hope
of
regaining
the
ground
they
had
lost
and
that
their
armies
made
more
than
one
expedition
in
a
northerly
direction
the
inhabitants
of
the
thebaid
could
hardly
fail
to
remain
faithful
to
them
at
heart
and
to
recognise
in
them
the
legitimate
representatives
of
the
posterity
of
amon
it
is
possible
that
now
and
again
they
succeeded
in
penetrating
as
far
as
the
ancient
capital
but
if
so
their
success
was
always
ephemeral
and
their
sojourn
left
no
permanent
traces
the
same
causes
however
which
had
broken
up
the
constituent
elements
and
destroyed
the
unity
of
greater
egypt
at
the
end
of
the
theban
period
were
still
at
work
in
saite
times
to
prevent
the
building
up
again
of
the
empire
the
preservation
of
the
balance
of
power
in
this
long
and
narrow
strip
of
country
depended
on
the
centre
of
attraction
and
on
the
seat
of
government
being
nearly
equidistant
from
the
two
extremities
this
condition
had
been
fulfilled
as
long
as
the
court
resided
at
thebes
but
as
the
removal
of
the
seat
of
government
to
the
delta
caused
the
loss
and
separation
of
the
southern
provinces
so
its
sudden
return
to
the
extreme
south
with
a
temporary
sojourn
at
napata
necessarily
produced
a
similar
effect
and
led
to
the
speedy
secession
of
the
northern
provinces
in
either
case
the
dynasty
placed
at
one
extremity
of
the
empire
was
unable
to
sustain
for
any
length
of
time
the
weight
depending
on
it
at
the
other
when
once
the
balance
became
even
slightly
disturbed
it
could
not
regain
its
equilibrium
and
there
was
consequently
a
sudden
dislocation
of
the
machinery
of
government
the
triumph
of
the
saite
dynasty
accomplished
the
final
ruin
of
the
work
begun
under
the
papis
and
brought
to
completion
by
the
amenemhâîts
and
the
usirtasens
greater
egypt
ceased
to
exist
after
more
than
twenty
centuries
of
glorious
life
and
was
replaced
by
the
little
egypt
of
the
first
ages
of
history
the
defeat
of
the
military
chiefs
of
the
north
the
annexation
of
the
principality
of
amon
and
the
final
expulsion
of
the
ethiopians
and
the
asiatics
had
occupied
scarcely
nine
years
but
these
feats
constituted
only
the
smaller
part
of
the
work
psammetichus
had
to
accomplish
his
subsequent
task
lay
in
restoring
prosperity
to
his
kingdom
or
at
all
events
in
raising
it
from
the
state
of
misery
into
which
two
centuries
of
civil
wars
and
invasions
had
plunged
it
the
important
cities
had
suffered
grievously
memphis
had
been
besieged
and

by
assault
by

piônkhi
and

the
little
good
which
this
prince
had
been
able
to
accomplish
was
effaced
immediately
after
his
death
the

had
been
neglected
the

of

relaxed
and
the
population
periodically
decimated
or
driven
to
take

in
the

often
allowed

to
lie
waste
so
that
famine
had
been
superadded
to
the
other
evils
under
which
the
land
already
groaned
psammetichus
having
forced
the
feudal
lords
to
submit
to
his
supremacy
deprived
them
of
the
royal
titles
they
had
unduly
assumed
he
no
longer
tolerated
their
habits
of
private
warfare
but
restricted
them
to
the
functions
of
hereditary
governors
which
their
ancestors
had
exercised
under
the
conquering
dynasties
of
former
times
and
this
enforced
peace
soon
allowed
the
rural
population
to
devote
themselves
joyfully
to
their
regular
occupations
during
the
last
few
years
records
of
a
certain
number
of
persons
have
been
discovered
whose
names
and
condition
prove
that
they
were
the
descendants
of
princes
of
the
ethiopian
and
bubastite
periods
a
certain
akaneshu
who
was
prince
of
sebennytos
under
psammetichus
and
who
very
probably
was
the
grandson
of
akaneshu
prince
of
the
same
town
under
piônkhi
and
a
sheshonq
of
busiris
who
was
perhaps
a
descendant
of
sheshonq
prince
of
busiris
under
piônkhi
with
so
fertile
a
soil
two
or
three
years
of
security
during
which
the
fellahîn
were
able
to
sow
and
reap
their
crops
free
from
the
fear
of
marauding
bands
sufficed
to
restore
abundance
if
not
wealth
to
the
country
and
psammetichus
succeeded
in
securing
both
these
and
other
benefits
to
egypt
thanks
to
the
vigilant
severity
of
his
administration
he
would
have
been
unable
to
accomplish
these
reforms
had
he
relied
only
on
the
forces
which
had
been
at
the
disposal
of
his
ancestors
the
native
troops
demoralised
by
poverty
and
the
undisciplined
bands
of
libyan
mercenaries
which
constituted
the
sole
normal
force
of
the
tanite
and
bubastite
pharaohs
and
the
barons
of
the
delta
and
middle
egypt
his
experience
of
these
two
classes
of
soldiery
had
decided
him
to
look
elsewhere
for
a
less
precarious
support
and
ever
since
chance
had
brought
him
in
contact
with
the
ionians
and
carians
he
had
surrounded
himself
with
a
regular
army
of
hellenic
and
asiatic
mercenaries
it
is
impossible
to
exaggerate
the
terror
that
the
apparition
of
these
men
produced
in
the
minds
of
the
african
peoples
or
the
revolution
they
effected
alike
in
peace
or
war
in
oriental
states
the
charge
of
the
spanish
soldiery
among
the
lightly
clad
of
mexico
and
peru
could
not
have
caused
more
dismay
than
did
that
of
the
hoplites
from
beyond
the
sea
among
the
archers
and
pikemen
of
egypt
and
libya
with
their
bulging
corselets
the
two
plates
of
which
protected
back
and
chest
their
greaves
made
of
a
single
piece
of
bronze
reaching
from
the
ankle
to
the
knee
their
square
or
oval
bucklers
covered
with
metal
their
heavy
rounded
helmets
fitting
closely
to
the
head
and
neck
and
surmounted
by
crests
of
waving
plumes
they
were
in
truth
men
of
brass
invulnerable
to
any
oriental
weapon
drawn
up
in
close
array
beneath
their
they
received
almost
unhurt
the
hail
of
arrows
and
stones
hurled
against
them
by
the
lightly
armed
infantry
and
then
when
their
own
trumpet
sounded
the
signal
for
attack
and
they
let
themselves
fall
with
their
whole
weight
upon
the
masses
of
the
enemy
brandishing
their
spears
above
the
upper
edge
of
their
bucklers
there
was
no
force
of
native
troops
or
company
of
mashauasha
that
did
not
waver
beneath
the
shock
and
finally
give
way
before
their
attack
the
egyptians
felt
themselves
incapable
of
overcoming
them
except
by
superior
numbers
or
by
stratagem
and
it
was
the
knowledge
of
their
own
hopeless
inferiority
which
prevented
the
feudal
lords
from
attempting
to
revenge
themselves
on
psammetichus
to
make
themselves
his
equals
they
would
have
been
obliged
either
to
take
a
sufficient
number
of
similar
warriors
into
their
own
pay
and
this
they
were
not
able
to
afford
or
they
must
have
won
over
those
already
in
the
employ
of
their
suzerain
but
the
liberality
with
which
psammetichus
treated
his
mercenaries
gave
them
good
cause
to
be
faithful
even
if
military
honour
had
not
sufficed
to
keep
them
loyal
to
their
employer
psammetichus
granted
to
them
and
their
compatriots
who
were
attracted
by
the
fame
of
egypt
a
concession
of
the
fertile
lands
of
the
delta
stretching
along
the
pelusiac
branch
of
the
nile
and
he
was
careful
to
separate
the
ionians
from
the
carians
by
the
whole
breadth
of
the
river
this
was
a
wise
precaution
for
their
union
beneath
a
common
flag
had
not
extinguished
their
inherited
hatred
of
one
another
and
the
authority
of
the
general
did
not
always
suffice
to
prevent
fatal
quarrels
breaking
out
between
contingents
of
different
nationalities

psammetichus
no
doubt
hoped
to
inspire
them
with
some
of
the
qualities
which
he
discerned
in
the
colonists
but
egypt
during
the
last
two
centuries
had
suffered
too
much
at
the
hands
of
foreigners
of
all
kinds
to
be
favourably
disposed
to
these
it
would
have
been
different
had
they
presented
themselves
in
humble
guise
like
the
asiatics
and
africans
to
whom
egypt
had
opened
her
doors
so
freely
after
the
xviiith
dynasty
and
if
they
had
adopted
the
obsequious
manners
of
the
phoenician
and
hebrew
merchants
but
they
landed
from
their
ships
fully
equipped
for
war
and
proud
of
their
own
courage
and
ability
they
vied
with
the
natives
of
the
ancient
race
whether
of
plebeian
or
noble
birth
for
the
favour
of
the
sovereign
their
language
their
rude
military
customs
their
cunning
devices
in
trade
even
the
astonishment
they
manifested
at
the
civilisation
of
the
country
rendered
them
objects
of
disdain
as
well
as
of
jealous
hatred
to
the
egyptian
the
food
of
which
they
partook
made
them
unclean
in
native
estimation
and
the
horrified
fellah
shunned
contact
with
them
from
fear
of
defiling
himself
refusing
to
eat
with
them
or
to
use
the
same
knife
or
the
scribes
and
members
of
the
higher
classes
astonished
at
their
ignorance
treated
them
like
children
with
no
past
history
whose
ancestors
a
few
generations
back
had
been
mere
savages
although
unexpressed
at
first
this
hostility
towards
the
hellenes
was
not
long
in
manifesting
itself
openly
the
saite
tradition
attributed
it
to
a
movement
of
wounded
vanity
psammetichus
to
recompense
the
prowess
of
his
ionian
and
carian
soldiers
had
attached
them
to
his
own
person
and
assigned
to
them
the
post
of
honour
on
the
right
wing
when
the
army
was
drawn
up
for
review
or
in
battle
array
diodorus
siculus
states
that
it
was
during
the
syrian
war
that
the
king
thus
honoured
his
mercenary
troops
wiedemann
thinks
this
is
an
erroneous
inference
drawn
from
the
passage
of
herodotus
in
which
he
explains
the
meaning
of
the
word
asmakh
they
reaped
thus
the
double
advantage
of
the
glory
which
they
greatly
prized
and
of
the
higher
pay
attached
to
the
title
of
but
the
troops
who
had
hitherto
enjoyed
these
advantages
were
naturally
indignant
at
losing
them
and
began
to
murmur
one
particularly
galling
circumstance
at
last
caused
their
discontent
to
break
out
the
eastern
and
southern
frontiers
of
egypt

conterminous
with
those
of
two
conquering
empires
assyria
and
ethiopia
and
on
the
west
the
libyan
tribes
along
the
shores
of

powerful
enough
to
demand
constant
vigilance

the
part

psammetichus
among
other
reforms
had
reorganised
the
ancient
system
of
defence
while
placing
outposts
at
the
entrance
to
the
passes
leading
from
the
desert
into
the
nile
valley
he
had
concentrated
considerable
masses
of
troops
at
the
three
most
vulnerable
points
the
outlets
of
the
road
to
syria
the
country
surrounding

mareotis
and
the

cataract
he
had
fortified

a
defence

the
assyrians
marea

the
libyan

advanced

been
garrisoned
with

were
quartered
there
for
a
year
at
a
time
to
be
condemned
to
such
an
exile
for
so
long
a
period
raised
in
them
a
sense
of
profound
indignation
but
when
the
king
apparently
forgot
them
and
left
them
there
three
years
without
sending
other
troops
to
relieve
them
their
anger
knew
no
bounds
they
resolved
to
put
an
end
to
such
treatment
and
as
the
hope
of
a
successful
rebellion
seemed
but
small
they
decided
to
leave
the
country
two
hundred
and
forty
thousand
of
them
assembled
on
a
given
day
with
their
arms
and
baggage
and
marched
in
good
order
towards
ethiopia
psammetichus
warned
of
their
intentions
when
ifc
was
too
late
hastened
after
them
with
a
handful
of
followers
and
coming
up
with
them
besought
them
not
to
desert
their
national
gods
their
wives
and
their
children
he
had
nearly
prevailed
on
them
to
return
when
one
soldier
with
a
significant
gesture
intimated
that
while
manhood
lasted
they
had
power
to
create
new
families
wherever
they
might
chance
to
dwell
the
details
of
this
story
betray
the
popular
legend
but
nevertheless
have
a
basis
of
truth
the
inscriptions
from
the
time
of
psammetichus
onwards
never
mention
the
mashauasha
while
their
name
and
their
exploits
constantly
recur
in
the
history
of
the
preceding
dynasties
henceforth
they
and
their
chiefs
vanish
from
sight
and
discord
and
brigandage
simultaneously
cease
in
the
egyptian
nomes
it
was
very
probably
the
most
turbulent
among
these
auxiliaries
who
left
the
country
in
the
circumstances
above
narrated
since
they
could
not
contest
the
superiority
of
their
greek
rivals
they
concluded
that
their
own
part
was
played
out
and
rather
than
be
relegated
to
the
second
rank
they
preferred
to
quit
the
land
in
a
body
psammetichus
thus
deprived
of
their
support
at
the
moment
when
egypt
had
more
than
ever
need
of
all
her
forces
to
regain
her
rightful
position
in
the
world
reorganised
the
military
system
as
best
he
could
he
does
not
seem
to
have
relied
much
upon
the
contingents
from
upper
egypt
to
whom
was
doubtless
entrusted
the
defence
of
the
nubian
frontier
and
who
could
not
be
withdrawn
from
their
posts
without
danger
of
invasion
or
revolt
but
the
source
of
imminent
peril
did
not
lie
in
this
direction
where
ethiopia
exhausted
by
the
wars
of
taharqa
and
tanuatamanu
perhaps
needed
repose
even
more
than
egypt
itself
but
rather
on
the
asiatic
side
where
in
spite
of
the
complications
constantly
arising
in
karduniash
and
elam
had
by
no
means
renounced
his
claims
to
the
suzerainty
of
egypt
the
pharaoh
divided
the
feudatory
militia
of
the
delta
into
two
classes
which
resided
apart
in
different
sets
of
nomes
the
first
group
who
were
popularly
called
hermotybies
were
stationed
at
busiris
sais
and
khemmis
in
the
island
of
prosopitis
and
in
one
half
of
natho
in
fact
in
the
district
which
for
the
last
century
had
formed
the
centre
of
the
principality
of
the
saite
dynasty
perhaps
they
were
mostly
of
libyan
origin
and
represented
the
bands
of
mashauasha
who
from
father
to
son
had
served
under
tafnakhti
and
his
descendants
popular
report
numbered
them
at
men
all
told
and
the
total
number
of
the
other
class
known
as
the
calasiries
at
these
latter
belonged
in
my
opinion
to
the
pure
egyptian
race
and
were
met
with
at
thebes
while
the
troops
of
the
north
who
were
more
generally
called
out
were
scattered
over
the
territory
which
formerly
supported
the
tanite
and
bubastite
kings
and
latterly
pakruru
and
which
comprised
the
towns
of
bubastis
aphthis
tanis
mendes
sebennytos
athribis
pharbaathos
thmuis
onuphis
anysis
and
myecphoris
each
year
one
thousand
hermotybies
and
one
thousand
calasiries
were
chosen
to
form
the
royal
and
these
received
daily
five
minae
of
bread
apiece
two
minas
of
beef
and
four
bowls
of
wine
the
jealousy
which
had
been
excited
by
the
greek
troops
was
thus
lessened
as
well
as
the
discontent
provoked
by
the
emigration

transcription
of

according
to
a
variant
given
by
stephen
of
byzantium

as
yet
unknown
but
it
seems
to
me
to
conceal
a
title
analogous
to
that
of
and
to
designate
what
remained
of
libyan
soldiers
in
egypt
this
organisation
of
the
army
is
described
by
herodotus
as
existing
in
his
own
days
and
there
were
calasiries
and
hermotybies
in
the
egyptian
contingent
which
accompanied
the
army
of
mardonius
to
greece
it
is
nowhere
stated
that
it
was
the
work
of
psammetichus
but
everything
points
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
so
at
all
events
in
the
form
in
which
it
was
known
to
the
greeks
the
king
of
napata
gladly
welcomed
the
timely
reinforcements
which
arrived
to
fill
up
the
vacancies
in
his
army
and
among
his
people
weakened
by
a
century
of
rapid
changes
and
generously
gave
them
permission
to
conquer
for
themselves
some
territory
in
the
possession
of
his
enemies
having
driven
out
the
barbarians
they
established
themselves
in
the
peninsula
formed
by
the
white
and
blue
niles
and
their
numbers
increased
so
greatly
that
in
course
of
time
they
became
a
considerable
nation
they
called
themselves
asmakh
the
men
who
stand
on
the
left
hand
in
memory
of
the
affront
put
upon
them
and
which
they
had
avenged
by
their
greek
travellers
and
geographers
called
them
sometimes
automoli
sometimes
sembrites
names
which
clung
to
them
till
almost
the
beginning
of
our
present
era
this
departure
of
the
mashauasha
was
as
the
last
blast
of
wind
after
a
storm
the
swell
subsided
by
degrees
and
peace
reigned
in
the
interior

as
best
it

to

were

apparently
was

destroyed
the

remains

here

the
quarries
were
reopened

the

stimulated
by
the
orders
which
flowed
in
soon
flourished
anew
the
engraving
of
hieroglyphics
and
the
art
of
painting
both
attained
a
remarkable
degree
of
elegance
fine
statues
and
were
executed
in
large
numbers
and
a
widely
spread
school
of
art
was
developed
the
local
artists
had
scrupulously
observed
and
handed
down
the
traditions
which
obtained
in
the
time
of
the
pyramids
and
more
especially
those
of
the
first
theban
period
even
the
few
fragments
that
have
come
down
to
us
of
the
works
of
these
artists
in
the
age
of
the
ramessides
recall
rather
the
style
of
the
vith
and
xiith
dynasties
than
that
of
their
theban
contemporaries
their
style
brought
to
perfection
by
evident
imitation
of
the
old
memphite
masters
pleases
us
by
its
somewhat
severe
elegance
the
taste
shown
in
the
choice
of
detail
and
the
extraordinary
skill
displayed
in
the
working
of
the
stone
the
memphites
had
by
preference
used
limestone
for
their
sculpture
the
thebans
red
and
grey
granite
or
sandstone
but
the
artists
of
the
age
of
psammetichus
unhesitatingly
attacked
basalt
breccia
or
serpentine
and
obtained
marvellous
effects
from
these
finely
grained
materials
of
regular
and
even
texture
the
artistic
renaissance
which
they
brought
to
its
height
had
been
already
inaugurated
under
the
ethiopians
and
many
of
the
statues
we
possess
of
the
reign
of
taharqa
are
examples
of
excellent
workmanship
that
of
amenertas
was
at
the
time
of
its
discovery
the
face
half
buried
by
the
wig
which
we
usually
associate
with
the
statues
of
the
goddesses
has
a
dull
and
vacant
expression
in
spite
of
its
set
smile
and
the
modelling
of
the
figure
is
rather
weak
but
nevertheless
there
is
something
easy
and
refined
in
the
gracefulness
of
the
statue
as
a
whole
chieck
beled
gizeh
museum
a
statuette
of
another
spouse
though
mutilated
and
unfinished
is
pleasing
from
its
greater
breadth
of
style
although
such
breadth
is
rarely
found
in
the
works
of
this
school
which
toned
down
elongated
and
attenuated
the
figure
till
it
often
lost
in
vigour
what
it
gained
in
distinction
the
one
point
in
which
the
saite
artists
made
a
real
advance
was
in
the
treatment
of
the
heads
of
their
models
illustration
memphite
of
the
saite
epoch
drawn
by
boudier
from
a
heliogravure
in
mariette
the
relief
was
worked
into
the
masonry
of
a
house
in
memphis
in
the
byzantine
period
and
it
was
in
order
to
fit
it
to
the
course
below
that
the
masons
bevelled
the
lower
part
of
it
the
expression
is
often
refined
and
idealised
as
in
the
case
of
older
works
but
occasionally
the
portraiture
is
exact
even
to
coarseness
it
was
not
the
idealised
likeness
of
montumihâît
which
the
artist
wished
to
portray
but
montumihâît
himself
with
his
low
forehead
his
small
eyes
his
thin
cheeks
and
the
deep
lines
about
his
nose
and
mouth
and
besides
this
the
wrinkles
the
feet
the
cranial
projections
the
shape
of

and

fidelity
a
statue
was
no
longer
as
in
earlier
days
merely
a
piece
of
sacred
stone
the
support
of
the
divine
or
human
double
in
which
artistic
value
was
an
accessory
of
no
importance
and
was
esteemed
only
as
a
guarantee
of
resemblance
without
losing
aught
of
its
religious
significance
a
statue
henceforward
became
a
work
of
art
admired
and
prized
for
the
manner
in
which
the
sculptor
faithfully
represented
his
model
as
well
as
for
its
mystic
utility
the
reign
of
psammetichus
lasted
till
nearly
the
end
of
the
century
and
was
marked
by
peace
both
at
home
and
abroad
no
doubt
skirmishes
of
some
kind
took
place
in
lydia
and
nubia
but
we
know
nothing
of
them
nor
have
we
any
account
of
engagements
with
the
asiatics
which
from
time
to
time
must
have
taken
place
during
this
reign
psammetichus
followed
with
a
vigilant
eye
the
revolutionary
changes
beyond
the
isthmus
actuated
at
first
by
the
fear
of
an
offensive
movement
on
the
part
of
syria
and
when
that
ceased
to
be
a
danger
by
the
hope
of
one
day
recovering
in
southern
syria
at
all
events
that
leading
position
which
his
predecessors
had
held
so
long
tradition
asserts
that
he
wisely
confined
his
ambition
to
the
conquest
of
the
philistine
pentapolis
it
is
even
reported
that
he
besieged
ashdod
for
years
before
gaining
possession
of
it
if
we
disregard
the
cipher
which
is
evidently
borrowed
from
some
popular
romance
the
fact
in
itself
is
in
no
way
improbable
ashdod
was
a
particularly
active
community
and
had
played
a
far
more
important
part
in
earlier
campaigns
than
any
other
member
of
the
pentapolis
it
possessed
outside
the
town
proper
which
was
situated
some
little
distance
from
the
coast
a
seaport
similar
to
that
of
gaza
and
of
sufficient
size
to
shelter
a
whole
fleet

whoever
held
this
harbour

control
over
the
main
routes
leading
from
syria
into
egypt
psammetichus
probably
undertook
this
expedition
towards
the
end
of
his
life
when
the
victories
gained
by
the
medes
had
demonstrated
the
incapacity
of
assyria
to
maintain
the
defence
of
her
distant
provinces
at
one
time
i
was
inclined
to
explain
this
period
of
years
by
assuming
that
the
fall
of
ashdod
took
place
in
the
year
of
the
reign
and
that
herodotus
had
mistaken
the
date
of
its
surrender
for
the
duration
of
the
siege
such
an
hypothesis
is
however
unnecessary
since
it
is
very
probable
that
we
have
here
one
of
those
exaggerated
estimates
of
time
so
dear
to
the
hearts
of
popular
historians
if
we
are
to
believe
the
account
given
by
diodorus
it
was
in
syria
that
psammetichus
granted
the
honour
of
a
place
in
the
right
wing
of
his
army
to
the
greek
mercenaries
the
capture
of
ashdod
must
in
this
case
have
occurred
before
the
emigration
of
the
native
troops
in
jer
xxv
reference
is
made
to
remnant
of
ashdod
in
the
fourth
year
of
jehoiakim
about
and
the
decadence
of
the
city
is
generally
attributed
to
the
war
with
egypt
it
might
with
equal
probability
be
ascribed
to
the
scythian
invasion
the
attack
of
the
scythians
which
might
have
proved
dangerous
to
egypt
had
it
been
pushed
far
enough
had
left
her
unharmed
and
was
in
the
end
even
advantageous
to
her
it
was
subsequent
to
the
retreat
of
the
barbarians
no
doubt
that
sent
his
troops
into
philistia
and
succeeded
in
annexing
the
whole
or
part
of
it
after
this
success
he
was
content
to
wait
and
watch
the
course
of
events
the
surprising
revival
of
egypt
must
have
had
the
effect
of
infusing
fresh
life
into
the
egyptian
factions
existing
in
all
the
autonomous
states
and
in
the
prefectures
of
syria
the
appearance
of
the
troops
and
the
toleration
of
their
presence
within
the
territory
of
the
assyrian
empire
aroused
on
all
sides
the
hope
of
deliverance
and
incited
the
malcontents
to
take
some
immediate
action
we
do
not
know
what
may
have
happened
at
tyre
and
sidon
or
among
the
peoples
of
edom
and
arabia
but
judah
at
any
rate
under
the
rule
of
josiah
carefully
abstained
from
any
action
inconsistent
with
the
pledge
of
fidelity
which
it
had
given
to
assyria
indeed
the
whole
kingdom
was
completely
absorbed
in
questions
of
a
theological
nature
and
the
agitations
which
affected
the
religious
life
of
the
nation
reacted
on
its
political
life
as
well
josiah
as
he
grew
older
began
to
identify
himself
more
and
more
with
the
doctrines
taught
by
the
prophets
and
thanks
to
his
support
the
party
which
sought
to
complete
the
reforms
outlined
by
hezekiah
gained
fresh
recruits
every
day
the
opposition
which
they
had
formerly
aroused
among
the
priests
of
the
temple
had
gradually
died
out
partly
as
the
result
of
genuine
conviction
and
partly
because
the
priests
had
come
to
realise
that
the
establishment
of
a
single
exclusive
sanctuary
would
work
for
their
own
interest
and
advantage
the
high
priest
hilkiah
took
up
the
line
followed
by
jeremiah
and
was
supported
by
a
number
of
influential
personages
such
as
shaphan
the
scribe
son
of
azaliah
ahikam
achbor
son
of
micaiab
and
a
prophetess
named
huldah
who
had
married
the
keeper
of
the
royal
wardrobe
the
terrors
of
the
scythian
invasion
had
oppressed
the
hearts
and
quickened
the
zeal
of
the
orthodox
judah
they
declared
had
no
refuge
save
jahveh
alone
all
hope
was
lost
if
it
persisted
in
the
doctrines
which
had
aroused
against
the
faithless
the
implacable
wrath
of
jahveh
it
must
renounce
at
once
those
idols
and
superstitious
rites
with
which
his
worship
had
been
disfigured
and
overthrow
the
altars
which
were
to
be
found
in
every
part
of
the
country
in
order
to
concentrate
all
its
devotion
on
the
temple
of
solomon
in
a
word
judah
must
return
to
an
observance
of
the
strict
letter
of
the
law
as
it
had
been
followed
by
their
forefathers
but
as
this
venerable
code
was
not
to
be
found
either
in
the
of
the
or
in
any
of
the
other
writings
held
sacred
by
israel
the
question
naturally
arose
as
to
where
it
was
now
hidden
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
his
reign
josiah
sent
shaphan
the
scribe
to
the
temple
in
order
to
audit
the
accounts
of
the
sums
collected
at
the
gates
for
the
maintenance
of
the
building
after
the
accounts
had
been
checked
hilkiah
suddenly
declared
that
he
had
the
book
of
the
in
the
temple
and
thereupon
handed
the
document
to
shaphan
who
perused
it
forthwith
on
his
return
to
the
palace
the
scribe
made
his
report
servants
have
emptied
out
the
money
that
was
found
in
the
house
and
have
delivered
it
into
the
hand
of
the
workmen
then
he
added
the
priest
hath
delivered
me
a
book
and
proceeded
to
read
it
to
the
king
when
the
latter
had
heard
the
words
contained
in
this
book
of
the
law
he
was
seized
with
anguish
and
rent
his
garments
then
unable
to
arrive
at
any
decision
by
himself
he
sent
hilkiah
shaphan
ahikam
achbor
and
asaiah
to
inquire
of
jahveh
for
him
and
for
his
people
great
is
the
wrath
of
the
lord
that
is
kindled
against
us
because
our
fathers
have
not
hearkened
unto
the
words
of
this
book
to
do
according
unto
all
that
which
is
written
concerning
illustration
decorations
on
the
wrappings
of
a
mummy
the
envoys
betook
themselves
not
to
the
official
oracle
or
the
recognised
prophets
but
to
a
woman
the
prophetess
huldah
who
was
attached
to
the
court
in
virtue
of
her
office
and
she
bade
them
in
the
name
of
the
most
high
to
summon
a
meeting
of
the
faithful
and
after
reading
the
new
code
to
them
to
call
upon
all
present
to
promise
that
they
would
henceforth
observe
its
ordinances
thus
jahveh
would
be
appeased
and
since
the
king
had
his
garments
and
wept
before
me
i
also
have
heard
thee
saith
jahveh
therefore
behold
i
will
gather
thee
to
thy
fathers
and
thou
shalt
be
gathered
to
thy
grave
in
josiah
thereupon
having
summoned
the
elders
of
judah
and
jerusalem
went
up
into
the
temple
and
there
standing
on
the
platform
he
read
the
book
of
the

in
the
presence
of
the
whole

kings

the
beginning
of
prophecy
was
suppressed
when
the
capture
of
jerusalem
proved
that
the
reform
of
divine
worship
had
not
succeeded
in
averting
the
wrath
of
jahveh
it
probably
contained
directions
to
read
the
of
the
to
the
people
and
to
persuade
them
to
adopt
its
precepts
followed
by
a
promise
to
save
judah
provided
it
remained
faithful
to
its
engagements
it
dealt
with
questions
which
had
been
frequent
subjects
of
debate
in
prophetic
circles
since
the
days
of
hezekiah
and
the
anonymous
writer
who
had
compiled
it
was
so
strongly
imbued
with
the
ideas
of
jeremiah
and
had
so
closely
followed
his
style
that
some
have
been
inclined
to
ascribe
the
work
to
jeremiah
himself
it
has
always
been
a
custom
among
orientals
to
affirm
that
any
work
for
which
they
profess
particular
esteem
was
discovered
in
the
temple
of
a
god
the
egyptian
priests
for
instance
invented
an
origin
of
this
nature
for
the
more
important
chapters
of
their
book
of
the
dead
and
for
the
leading
treatises
in
the
scientific
literature
of
egypt
the
author
of
the
book
of
the
law
had
ransacked
the
distant
past
for
the
name
of
the
leader
who
had
delivered
israel
from
captivity
in
egypt
he
told
how
moses
when
he
began
to
feel
the
hand
of
death
upon
him
determined
to
declare
in
gilead
the
decrees
which
jahveh
had
delivered
to
him
for
the
guidance
of
his
people
in
these
ordinances
the
indivisible
nature
of
god
and
his
jealousy
of
any
participation
of
other
deities
in
the
worship
of
his
people
are
strongly
emphasised
shall
surely
destroy
all
the
places
wherein
the
nations
which
ye
shall
possess
served
their
gods
upon
the
high
mountains
and
upon
the
hills
and
under
every
green
tree
and
ye
shall
break
down
their
altars
and
dash
in
pieces
their
pillars
and
burn
their
asherim
with
fire
and
ye
shall
hew
down
the
graven
images
of
their

and
ye
shall
destroy
their
name
out
of
that
even
jerome
and
john
chrysostom
admitted
that
deuteronomy
was
the
book
discovered
by
hilkiah
in
the
temple
during
the
reign
of
josiah
and
this
view
is
accepted
at
present
though
it
is
applied
not
to
the
book
of
deuteronomy
as
it
appears
in
the
pentateuch
but
rather
to
the
nucleus
of
this
book
and
especially
chaps
deut
xii
even
were
a
prophet
or
dreamer
of
dreams
to
arise
in
the
midst
of
the
faithful
and
direct
them
by
a
sign
or
a
miracle
to
turn
aside
after
those
accursed
gods
they
must
not
follow
the
teaching
of
these
false
guides
not
even
if
the
sign
or
miracle
actually
came
to
pass
but
must
seize
and
slay
them

thy
brother
the
son
of
thy
mother

or

thee

let

shalt
not
consent

nor
hearken
unto
him
neither
shall
thine
eye
pity
him
neither
shalt
thou
spare
neither
shalt
thou
conceal
him
but
thou
shalt
surely
kill
him
thine
hand
shall
be
first
upon
him
to
put
him
to
death
and
afterwards
the
hand
of
all
the
people
and
thou
shalt
stone
him
with
stones
that
he
die
because
he
hath
sought
to
draw
thee
away
from
jahveh
and
this
jahveh
was
not
the
jahveh
of
any
special
place
he
was
not
the
jahveh
of
bethel
or
of
dan
or
of
mizpah
or
of
geba
or
of
beersheba
he
is
simply
jahveh
yet
the
seat
of
his
worship
was
not
a
matter
of
indifference
to
him
the
place
which
jahveh
shall
choose
out
of
all
your
tribes
to
put
his

there

ye
seek

thither

thou

thither
shall
ye
bring

your

not

the

closely
as
possible
to

ideal

was
not
to
lift
up
his
heart
above
his
brethren
nor
set
his
mind
on
the
possession
of
many
chariots

or

which
later

three
great

are

the

was
celebrated
in

of

when
the

had
already
come

as
commemorative
of

the
other
two

feast
of

and
the
feast
of

were
merely
associated

seven
weeks
after

beginning
of

the

the
claim
of
the
priest
to
a
share
in
the
victim
and
in
the
offerings
made
on
various
occasions
is
maintained
and
the
lawgiver
allows
him
to
draw
a
similar
benefit
from
the
annual
and
triennial
tithes
which
he
imposes
on
corn

devoted
to
a

the
priest
was
thus
placed
on
the

footing
as

the
stranger

his
influence

step

recognisable

before

the

offered
no
objection
to
these
acts
he
regarded
them
in
the
first
place
as
the
private
affairs
of
the
subjects
of
the
empire
with
which
he
had
no
need
to
interfere
so
long
as
the
outburst
of
religious
feeling
did
not
tend
towards
a
revolt
we
know
moreover
that
josiah
guided
on
this
point
by
the
prophets
would
have
believed
that
he
was
opposing
the
divine
will
had
he
sought
to
free
himself
from
the
assyrian
yoke
by
ordinary
political
methods
besides
this
in
under
five
years
after
the
scythian
invasion
the
prefect
of
samaria
had
possibly
not
sufficient
troops
at
his
disposal
to
oppose
the
encroachments
of
the
vassal
princes
it
was
an
affair
of
merely
a
few
months
in
the
following
year
when
the
work
of

was

commanded
that
the

should
be
kept
in
the
manner
prescribed
in

flocked
into

as

impression

minds
of

a

cf

the
text
of

appears
to
imply
that
it
was
the
first

celebrated
in
jerusalem
it
also
gives
in
chap

after
the
mention
of

a
date
of
the
seventh

eighth

which
is
not
usually
accepted

it
is
in
contradiction
with
what
is
affirmed
in

viz
that
the
passover
celebrated
at
jerusalem
was
in
the
same
year
as
the
reform
in
the
eighteenth
year
it
is
to
do
away
with
the
contradiction
between
these
two
passages
that
the
hebrew
text
has
suppressed
the
mention
of
the
month
i
think
however
it
ought
to
be
considered
authentic
and
be
retained
if
we
are
allowed
to
place
the
celebration
of
the
passover
in
what
would
be
one
year
after
to
do
this
it
would
not
be
needful
to
correct
the
regnal
date
in

text
admitting
that
the

took
place
in
the
passover
of
would
still
quite
well
have
taken
place
in

of

on
the
time
of
year
at
which
the
king
had
ascended
the
throne
the
first
outburst
of
zeal
having
spent
itself
a
reaction
was
ere
long
bound
to
set
in
both
among
the
ruling
classes
and
among
the
people
and
the
spectacle
that
asia
at
that
time
presented
to
their
view
was
truly
of
a
nature
to
incite
doubts
in
the
minds
of
the
faithful
assyria
that
assyria
of
which
the
prophets
had
spoken
as
the
irresistible
emissary
of
the
most
high
had
not
only
failed
to
recover
from
the
injuries
she
had
received
at
the
hands
first
of
the
medes
and
then
of
the
scythians
but
had
with
each
advancing
year
seen
more
severe
wounds
inflicted
upon
her
and
hastening
her
irretrievably
to
her
ruin
and
besides
this
egypt
and
chaldæa
the
ancient
kingdoms
which
had
for
a
short
time
bent
beneath
her
yoke
had
now
once
more
arisen
and
were
astonishing
the
world
by
their
renewed
vigour
psammetichus
it
is
true
after
having
stretched
his
arm
across
the
desert
and
laid
hands
upon
the
citadel
which
secured
to
him
an
outlet
into
syria
for
his
armies
had
proceeded
no
further
and
thus
showed
that
he
was
not
inclined
to
reassert
the
ancient
rights
of
egypt
over
the
countries
of
the
jordan
and
the
orontes
but
he
had
died
in
and
his
son
necho
who
succeeded
him
did
not
manifest
the
same
peaceful
intentions
the
last
dated
stele
of
psammetichus
is
the
official
epitaph
of
the
apis
which
died
in
his
year
on
the
other
hand
an
apis
born
in
the
year
of
psammetichus
died
in
the
sixteenth
year
of
necho
after
having
lived
years
months
days
a
very
simple
calculation
shows
that
psammetichus
reigned
years
as
stated
by
herodotus
and
manetho
according
to
julius
africanus
if
he
decided
to
try
his
fortune
in
syria
supported
by
his
greek
and
egyptian
battalions
what
would
be
the
attitude
that
judah
would
assume
between
moribund
assyria
and
the
kingdom
of
the
pharaohs
in
its
renewed
vigour
it
was
in
the
spring
of
that
the
crisis
occurred
nineveh
besieged
by
the
medes
was
on
the
point
of
capitulating
and
it
was
easy
to
foresee
that
the
question
as
to
who
should
rule
there
would
shortly
be
an
open
one
should
egypt
hesitate
longer
in
seizing
what
she
believed
to
be
her
rightful
heritage
she
would
run
the
risk
of
finding
the
question
settled
and
another
in
possession
necho
quitted
memphis
and
made
his
way
towards
the
asiatic
frontier
with
the
army
which
his
father
had
left
to
him
it
was
no
longer
composed
of
the
bands
of
the
ethiopian
kings
or
the
princes
of
the
delta
temporarily
united
under
the
rule
of
a
single
leader
but
all
the
while
divided
by
reciprocal
hatreds
and
suspicions
which
doomed
it
to
failure
all
the
troops
which
constituted
it
egyptians
libyans
and
greeks
alike
were
thoroughly
under
the
control
of
their
chief
and
advanced
in
a
compact
and
irresistible
mass
the
nile
like
a
river
its
volume
rolls
onward

said

where
the
prophet
describes
not
the
army
which

against
josiah
but
that
which
was
beaten
at
carchemish
with
a
difference
of
date
of
only
three
or
four
years
the
constituent
elements
of
the

were
certainly
the
same
so
that
the
description
of

would
apply
to
the
other
as
soon
as
josiah
heard
the
news
he
called
together
his
troops
and
prepared
to
resist
the
attack
necho
affected
not
to
take
his
demonstrations
seriously
and
sent
a
disdainful
message
recommending
him
to
remain
neutral

not
the
message
of
necho
to
josiah
is
known
to
us
from
chron
xxxv
having
despatched
the
message
probably
at
the
moment
of
entering
the
shephelah
he
continued
in
a
northerly
direction
nothing
doubting
that
his
warning
had
met
a
friendly
reception
but
however
low
nineveh
had
fallen
josiah
could
not
feel
that
he
was
loosed
from
the
oaths
which
bound
him
to
her
and
trusting
in
the
help
of
jahveh
he
threw
himself
resolutely
into
the
struggle
the
egyptian
generals
were
well
acquainted
with
the
route
as
far
as
the
farther
borders
of
philistia
having
passed
along
it
a
few
years
previously
at
the
time
of
the
campaign
of
psammetichus
but
they
had
no
experience
of
the
country
beyond
ashdod
and
were
solely
dependent
for
guidance
on
the
information
of
merchants
or
the
triumphant
records
of
the
old
theban
pharaohs
these
monuments
followed
the
traditional
road
which
had
led
their
ancestors
from
gaza
to
megiddo
from
megiddo
to
qodshu
from
qodshu
to
carchemish
and
they
were
reckoning
on
passing
through
the
valley
of
the
jordan
and
then
that
of
the
orontes
without
encountering
any
resistance
when
at
the
entrance
to
the
gorges
of
carmel
they
were
met
by
the
advance
guard
of
the
judæan
army
josiah
not
having
been
warned
in
time
to
meet
them
as
they
left
the
desert
had
followed
a
road
parallel
to
their
line
of
march
and
had
taken
up
his
position
in
advance
of
them
on
the
plain
of
megiddo
on
the
very
spot
where
thutmosis
iii
had
vanquished
the
syrian
confederates
nearly
ten
centuries
before
the
king
of
judah
was
defeated
and
killed
in
the
confusion
of
the
battle
and
the
conqueror
pushed
on
northwards
without
at
that
moment
giving
the
fate
of
the
scattered
jews
a
further
thought
he
rapidly
crossed
the
plain
of
the
orontes
by
the
ancient
caravan
track
and
having
reached
the
euphrates
he
halted
under
the
walls
of
carchemish
perhaps
he
may
have
heard
there
of
the
fall
of
nineveh
and
the
fear
of
drawing
down
upon
himself
the
medes
or
the
babylonians
prevented
him
from
crossing
the
river
and
raiding
the
country
of
the
balikh
which
from
the
force
of
custom
the
royal
scribes
still
persisted
in
designating
by
the
disused
name
of
mitanni
kings
xxiii
cf
chron
xxxv
it
is
probably
to
this
battle
that
herodotus
alludes
when
he
says
that
necho
overcame
the
syrians
at
magdôlos
the
identity
of
magdôlos
and
megiddo
accepted
by
almost
all
historians
was
disputed
by
gutschmid
who
sees
in
the
magdôlos
of
herodotus
the
migdol
of
the
frontier
and
in
the
engagement
itself
an
engagement
of
necho
with
the
assyrians
and
their
philistine
allies
also
by
th
reinach
who
prefers
to
identify
magdôlos
with
one
of
the
migdols
near
ascalon
and
considers
this
combat
as
fought
against
the
assyrian
army
of
occupation
if
the
information
in
herodotus
were
indeed
borrowed
from
hecatasus
of
miletus
and
by
the
latter
from
the
inscription
placed
by
necho
in
the
temple
of
branchidae
it
appears
to
me
impossible
to
admit
that
magdôlos
does
not
here
represent
megiddo
the
text
of
kings
xxiii
says
positively
that
necho
was
marching
towards
the
euphrates
the
name
mitanni
is
found
even
in
ptolemaic
times
he
returned
southwards
after
having
collected
the
usual
tributes
and
posted
a
few
garrisons
at
strategic
points
at
biblah
he
held
a
kind
of
to
receive
the
homage
of
the
independent
and
of
the
old
vassals
of
assyria
who
owing
to
the
rapidity
of
his
movements
had
not
been
able
to
tender
their
offerings
on
his
outward
march
the
submission
of
the
phoenicians
to
necho
is
gathered
from
a
passage
in
berosus
where
he
says
that
the
egyptian
army
beaten
at
carchemish
comprised
phoenicians
besides
syrians

doubtless

under

one
hundred
talents
of
silver

one
of

the
egyptian
monarch
returned
to
his
own
country

indications
lead
us
to
believe
that
he
was
obliged
to
undertake
other
punitive
expeditions
the
philistines
probably
deceived
by
false
rumours
of
his
defeat
revolted
against
him
about
the
time

was
engaged

of

of

that
the

coming

is
the
egyptian
and
not
the
chaldaean
as
do
most
writers
the
only
time
that
danger
could
have
threatened
philistia
from
the
egyptians
coming
from
the
north
was
when
necho
victorious
was
returning
from
his
first
campaign
in
this
case
the
kadytis
of
herodotus
which
has
caused
so
much
trouble
to
commentators
would
certainly
be
gaza
and
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
explaining
how
the
tradition
preserved
by
the
greek
historian
placed
the
taking
of
this
town
after
the
battle
of
megiddo
he
wished
thereupon
to
perpetuate
the
memory
of
the
greeks
who
had
served
him
so
bravely
and
as
soon
as
the
division
of
the
spoil
had
been
made
he
sent
as
an
offering
to
the
temple
of
apollo
at
miletus
the
cuirass
which
he
had
worn
throughout
the
campaign
we
can
picture
the
reception
which
his
subjects
gave
him
and
how
the
deputations
of
priests
and
nobles
in
white
robes
flocked
out
to
meet
him
with
garlands
of
flowers
in
their
hands
and
with
acclamations
similar
to
those
which
of
old
had
heralded
the
return
of
seti
or
ramses
ii
national
pride
no
doubt
was
flattered
by
this
revival
of
military
glory
but
other
motives
than
those
of
vanity
lay
at
the
root
of
the
delight
exhibited
by
the
whole
country
at
the
news
of
the
success
of
the
expedition
the
history
of
the
century
which
was
drawing
to
its
close
had
demonstrated
more
than
once
how
disadvantageous
it
was
to
egypt
to
be
separated
from
a
great
power
merely
by
the
breadth
of
the
isthmus
if
taharqa
instead
of
awaiting
the
attack
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
had
met
the
assyrians
at
the
foot
of
carmel
or
even
before
gaza
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
esarhaddon
to
turn
the
glorious
kingdom
of
the
pharaohs
into
an
assyrian
province
after
merely
a
few
weeks
of
fighting
the
dictates
of
prudence
more
than
those
of
ambition
rendered
therefore
the
conquest
of
syria
a
necessity
and
necho
showed
his
wisdom
in
undertaking
it
at
the
moment
when
the
downfall
of
nineveh
reduced
all
risk
of
opposition
to
a
minimum
it
remained
to
be
seen
whether
the
conquerors
of
would
tolerate
for
long
the
interference
of
a
third
robber
and
would
consent
to
share
the
spoil
with
these
africans
who
having
had
none
of
the
trouble
had
hastened
to
secure
the
profit

the
mediterranean
dependencies
of
assyria
such
as

judæ

naturally
within
the
sphere
of

than
that

indeed
cyaxares
never
troubled
himself
about

nabopolassar
who
considered
them
his
own

right

for
the
moment
too
much
in
hand
to
permit
of
his
reclaiming
them
the
aramæans
of
the
khabur
and
the
balikh
the
nomads
of
the
mesopotamian
plain
had
not
done
homage
to
him
and
the
country
districts
were
infested
with
numerous
bands
of
cimmerians
and
scythians
who
had
quite
recently
pillaged
the
sacred
city

and
violated
the
temple
of
the
god

nabopolassar
who
was
too
old
to
command
his
troops
in
person
probably
entrusted
the
conduct
of
them
to
nebuchadrezzar
who
was
the
son
he
had
appointed
to
succeed
him
and
who
had
also
married
the
median
princess
three
years
sufficed
this
prince
to
carry
the
frontier
of
the

chaldæan
empire
as
far
as
the
syrian
fords
of
the
euphrates
within

in

hands
of

probably
on
condition
of
their
paying
a

in

date

therefore

to
say
a

that

brought
these
preliminary
operations
to
a
successful

nabopolassar
considering
himself
protected
on
the
north
and
by
his
friendship
with
cyaxares
no
longer
hesitated
to
make
an
effort
to
recover
the
regions
dominated
by
egyptian
influence

owing
probably
to
the
resistance
offered
by
the

to

the
editor
without
mentioning
the
battle
of
carchemish
recalls
in
passing
that
king
of
babylon
had
taken
from
the
brook
of
egypt
unto
the
river
euphrates
all
that
pertained

by

with

irony
two
or
three
brief
vivid

brought
him

jer

the
submission
of
all
these
peoples
is
implied
by
the
passage
already
cited
in
kings
xxiv
berosus
speaks
of
the
phoenician
jewish
and
syrian
prisoners
whom
nebuchadrezzar
left
to
his
generals
when
he
resolved
to
return
to
babylon
by
the
shortest
route
he
feared
lest
a
competitor
should
dispute
his
throne
perhaps
his
younger
brother
that
who
had
figured
at
his
side
at
the
dedication
of
a
temple
to
marduk
he
therefore
concluded
an
armistice
with
necho
by
the
terms
of
which
he
remained
master
of
the
whole
of
syria
between
the
euphrates
and
the
wady
and
then
hastily
turned
homewards
but
his
impatience
could
not
brook
the
delay
occasioned
by
the
slow
march
of
a
large
force
nor
the
ordinary
circuitous
route
by
carchemish
and
through
mesopotamia
he
hurried
across
the
arabian
desert
accompanied
by
a
small
escort
of
light
troops
and
presented
himself
unexpectedly
at
the
gates
of
babylon
he
found
all
in
order
his
chaldæan
ministers
had
assumed
the
direction
of
affairs
and
had
reserved
the
throne
for
the
rightful
heir
he
had
only
to
appear
to
be
acclaimed
and
obeyed
his
reign
was
long
prosperous
and
on
the
whole
peaceful
the
recent
changes
in
asiatic
politics
had
shut
out
the
chaldæans
from
the
majority
of
the
on
which
the
assyrians
had
been
wont
to
wage
warfare
with
the
tribes
on
their
eastern
and
northern
frontiers
we
no
longer
see
stirring
on
the
those
confused
masses
of
tribes
and
communities
of
whose
tumultuous
life
the
ninevite
annals
make
such
frequent
record
elam
as
an
independent
state
no
longer
existed
neither
did
philipi
and
namri
nor
the
cossæans
nor
parsua
nor
the
medes
with
their
perpetual
divisions
nor
the
urartians
and
the
mannai
in
a
constant
state
of
ferment
within
their
mountain
territory
all
that
remained
of
that
turbulent
world
now
constituted
a
single
empire
united
under
the
hegemony
of
the
medes
and
the
rule
of
a
successful
conqueror
the
greater
part
of
blam
was
already
subject
to
those
achæmenides
who
called
themselves
sovereigns
of
anshân
as
well
as
of
persia
and
whose
fief
was
dependent
on
the
kingdom
of
ecbatana
it
is
probable
that
chaldasa
received
as
her
share
of
the
ancient
susian
territory
the
low
countries
of
the
uknu
and
the
ulai
occupied
by
the
aramæan
tribes
of
the
puqudu
the
eutu
and
the
grambulu
but
susa
fell
outside
her
portion
and
was
soon
transformed
into
a
flourishing
iranian
town
king
and
the
princes
of
mentioned
in
jer
xxv
and
in
ezele
xxxii
in
the
time
of
nebuchadrezzar
are
probably
the
persian
kings
of
anshân
and
their
elamite
vassals
not
only
as
is
usually
believed
the
kings
and
native
princes
conquered
by
the
same
probably
holds
good
of
the
elam
which
an
anonymous
prophet
associates
with
the
medes
under
nabonidus
in
the
destruction
of
babylon
isa
xxi
the
princes
of
malamîr
appear
to
me
to
belong
to
an
anterior
epoch
the
enumeration
given
in
ezelc
xxiii
babylonians
and
all
the
chaldæans
pelted
and
shoa
and
koa
shows
us
probably
that
the
aramæans
of
the
lower
tigris
represented
by
pekôd
as
those
of
the
lower
euphrates
are
by
the
chaldæans
belonged
to
the
babylonian
empire
in
the
time
of
the
prophet
they
are
also
considered
as
belonging
to
babylon
in
the
passage
of
an
anonymous
prophet
jer
i
who
wrote
in
the
last
days
of
the
chaldæn
empire
up
against
the
land
of
merathaim
even
against
it
and
the
inhabitants
of
translators
and
commentators
have
until
quite
recently
mistaken
the
import
of
the
name
pekôd
the
plains
bordering
the
right
bank
of
the
tigris
from
the
uknu
to
the
turnat
or
the
eadanu
which
had
belonged
to
babylon
from
the
very
earliest
times
were
no
doubt
still
retained
by
her
but
the
mountain
district
which
commanded
them
certainly
remained
in
the
hands
of
cyaxares
as
well
as
the
greater
part
of
assyria
proper
and
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
from
the
eadanu
northwards
the
tigris
formed
the
boundary
between
the
two
allies
as
far
as
the
confluence
of
the
zab
this
is
what
appears
to
me
to
follow
from
the
account
of
the
conquest
babylon
by
cyrus
as
related
by
herodotus
the
entire
basin
of
the
upper
tigris
and
its
assyrian
colonies
amidi
and
tushkân
were
now
comprised
in
the
sphere
of
medic
influence
and
the
settlement
of
the
scythians
at
harrân
around
one
of
the
most
venerated
of
the
semitic
sanctuaries
shows
to
what
restrictions
the
new
authority
of
chaldasa
was
subjected
even
in
the
districts
of
mesopotamia
which
were
formerly
among
the
most
faithful
possessions
of
nineveh
if
these
barbarians
had
been
isolated
they
would
not
long
have
defied
the
king
of
babylon
but
being
akin
to
the
peoples
who
were
subject
to
cyaxares
they
probably
claimed
his
protection
and
regarded
themselves
as
his
liege
men
it
was
necessary
to
treat
them
with
consideration
and
tolerate
the
arrogance
of
their
presence
upon
the
only
convenient
road
which
connected
the
eastern
with
the
western
provinces
of
the
kingdom
it
is
therefore
evident
that
there
was
no
opening
on
this
side
for
those
struggles
in
which
assyria
had
exhausted
her
best
powers
one
war
was
alone
possible
that
with
media
but
it
was
fraught
with
such
danger
that
the
dictates
of
prudence
demanded
that
it
should
be
avoided
at
all
costs
even
should
the
alliance
between
the
two
courts
cease
to
be
cemented
by
a
royal
marriage
however
great
the
confidence
which
he
justly
placed
in
the
valour
of
his
chaldæans
nebuchadrezzar
could
not
hide
from
himself
the
fact
that
for
two
centuries
they
had
always
been
beaten
by
the
assyrians
and
that
therefore
he
would
run
too
great
a
risk
in
provoking
hostilities
with
an
army
which
had
got
the
better
of
the
conquerors
of
his
people
besides
this
cyaxares
was
fully
engaged
in
subjecting
the
region
which
he
had
allotted
to
himself
and
had
no
special
desire
to
break
with
his
ally
nothing
is
known
of
his
history
during
the
years
which
followed
the
downfall
of
nineveh
but
it
is
not
difficult
to
guess
what
were
the
obstacles
he
had
to
surmount
and
the
result
of
the
efforts
which
he
made
to
overcome
them
the
country
which
extends
between
the
caspian
and
the
black
sea
the
mountain
block
of
armenia
the
basins
of
the
araxes
and
the
kur
the
valleys
of
the
halys
the
iris
and
the
thermodon
and
the
forests
of
the
and
the
taurus
itself
had
been
thrown
into
utter
confusion
by
the
cimmerians
and
the
scythians
nothing
remained
of
the
previous
order
of
things
which
had
so
long
prevailed
there
and
the
barbarians
who
for
a
century
and
a
half
had
destroyed
everything
in
the
country
seemed
incapable
of
organising
anything
in
its
place
urartu
had
shrunk
within
its
ancient
limits
around
ararat
and
it
is
not
known
who
ruled
her
the
civilisation
of
argistis
and
menuas
had
almost
disappeared
with
the
dynasty
which
had
opposed
the
power
of
assyria
and
the
people
who
had
never
been
much
impregnated
by
it
soon
fell
back
into
their
native
rude
habits
of
life
confused
masses
of
european
barbarians
were
stirring
in
etiaus
and
the
regions
of
the
araxes
seeking
a
country
in
which
to
settle
themselves
and
did
not
succeed
in
establishing
themselves
firmly
till
a
much
later
period
in
the
district
of
sakasênê
to
which
was
attached
the
name
of
one
of
their
tribes
strabo
states
that
armenia
and
the
maritime
regions
of
cappadocia
suffered
greatly
from
the
invasion
of
the
scythians
such
of
the
mushku
and
the
tabal
as
had
not
perished
had
taken
refuge
in
the
north
among
the
mountains
bordering
the
black
sea
where
they
were
ere
long
known
to
the
greeks
as
the
moschi
and
the
tibarenians
the
remains
of
the
cimmerian
hordes
had
taken
their
place
in
cappadocia
and
the
phrygian
population
which
had
followed
in
their
wake
had
spread
themselves
over
the
basin
of
the
upper
halys
and
over
the
ancient
milidu
which
before
long
took
from
them
the
name
of
armenia
all
these
elements
constituted
a
seething
struggling
restless
mass
of
people
actuated
by
no
plan
or
method
and
subject
merely
to
the
caprice
of
its
chiefs
it
was
indeed
the
of
which
the
hebrew
prophets
had
had
a
vision
which
at
times
overflowed
over
the
neighbouring
nations
and
at
others
was
consumed
within
and
wasted
itself
in
fruitless
ebullition
the
phrygian
origin
of
the
armenians
is
pointed
out
by
herodotus
and
by
eudoxius
jer
i
it
took
cyaxares
years
to
achieve
his
conquests
he
finally
succeeded
however
in
reducing
the
various
elements
to
subjection
urartians
scythians
cimmerians
chaldæ
and
the
industrious
tribes
of
the
chalybes
and
the
white
syrians
and
always
victorious
appeared
at
last
on
the
right
hank
of
the
halys
but
having
reached
it
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
foes
of
quite
a
different
calibre
from
those
with
whom
he
had
hitherto
to
deal
lydia
had
increased
both
in
wealth
and
in
vigour
since
the
days
when
her
king
ardys
informed
his
ally
that
he
had
avenged
the
death
of
his
father
and
driven
the
cimmerians
from
the
valley
of
the
msoander
he
had
by
so
doing
averted
all
immediate
danger
but
as
long
as
the
principal
horde
remained
unexterminated
another
invasion
was
always
to
be
feared
besides
which
the
barbarian
inroad
although
of
short
duration
had
wrought
such
havoc
in
the
country
that
no
native
power
in
asia
minor
appeared
nor
in
reality
was
able
to
make
the
effort
needful
to
destroy
them
their
king
dugdamis
it
will
be
remembered
met
his
death
in
cilicia
at
the
hands
of
the
assyrians
about
the
year
and
kôbos
his
successor
was
defeated
and
killed
by
the
scythians
under
madyes
about
the
repeated
repulses
they
had
suffered
had
the
effect
of
quickly
relieving
lydia
phrygia
and
the
remaining
states
of
the
ægean
and
the
black
sea
from
their
inroads
the
milesians
wrested
sinope
from
them
about
and
the
few
bands
left
behind
when
the
main
body
set
out
for
the
countries
of
the
euphrates
were
so
harried
and
decimated
by
the
people
over
whom
they
had
terrorised
for
nearly
a
century
that
they
had
soon
no
refuge
except
round
the
fortress
of
antandros
in
the
mountains
of
the
troad
most
of
the
kingdoms
whose
downfall
they
had
caused
never
recovered
from
their
reverses
but
lydia
which
had
not
laid
down
its
arms
since
the
death
of
gyges
became
possessed
by
degrees
of
the
whole
of
their
territory
phrygia
proper
came
back
to
her
in
the
general
redistribution
and
with
it
most
of
the
countries
which
had
been
under
the
rule
of
the
dynasty
of
midas
from
the
mountains
of
lycia
to
the
shores
of
the
black
sea
the
transfer
was
effected
apparently
with
very
slight
opposition
and
with
little
loss
of
time
since
in
the
four
or
five
years
which
followed
the
death
of
kôbos
ardys
had
risen
in
the
estimation
of
the
greeks
to
the
position
enjoyed
by
gyges
and
when
in
aristomenes
the
hero
of
the
messenian
wars
arrived
at
rhodes
it
is
said
that
he
contemplated
proceeding
from
thence
first
to
sardes
and
then
to
ecbatana
for
the
purpose
of
gaining
the
adherence
of
lydia
and
media
to
his
cause

messogis
drawn
by
boudier
from
the
heliogravure
of

thomas
death

an
end
to
his
projects
but
he
would
not
for
a
moment
have
entertained
them
had
not
ardys
been
at
that
time
at
the
head
of
a
renowned
and
flourishing
kingdom
the
renewal
of
international
commerce
followed
closely
on
the
of
peace
and
even
if
the
long
period
of
scythian
invasion
followed
by
the
destruction
of
nineveh
rendered
the
overland
route
less
available
for
regular
traffic
than
before
at
all
events
relations
between
the
inhabitants
of
the
euphrates
valley
and
those
of
the
iegean
littoral
were
resumed
to
such
good
purpose
that
before
long
several
fresh
marts
were
opened
in
lydia

of

drawn
by

from
the
heliogravure
of

and
thomas
kymê
and
ephesus
put
the
region
of
the
messogis
and
the
tmolus
into
communication
with
the
sea
but
the
lower
valleys
of
the
hermos
and
the
masander
were
closed
by
the
existence
of
greek
colonies
at
smyrna
clazomenas
colophon
priênê
and
miletus
all
hostile
to
the
mermnadæ
which
it
would
be
necessary
to
overcome
if
these
countries
were
to
enjoy
the
prosperity
shared
by
other
parts
of
the
kingdom
hence
the
principal
effort
made
by
the
lydians
was
either
directly
to
annex
these
towns
or
to
impose
such
treaties
on
them
as
would
make
them
their
dependencies
ardys
seized
priênê
towards
and
after
having
thus
established
himself
on
the
northern
shore
of
the
latrnio
gulf
he
proceeded
to
besiege
miletus
in
at
the
very
close
of
his
career
hostilities
were
wearily
prolonged
all
through
the
reign
of
sadyattes
and
down
to
the
sixth
year
of
alyattes
the
story
that
priênê
was
saved
under
alyattes
by
a
stratagem
of
the
philosopher
bias
is
merely
a
fable
of
which
several
other
examples
are
found
it
would
not
be
possible
to
conclude
from
it
as
grote
did
that
rule
over
the
town
was
but
ephemeral
the
periods
of
duration
assigned
here
to
the
reigns
of
these
princes
are
those
of
euschius
that
is
to
say
years
for
crosus
for
alyattes
for
sadyattes
for
ardys
julius
africanus
gives
for
sadyattes
and
for
ardys
while
herodotus
suggests
for
crosus
for
alyattes
for
sadyattes
and
for
ardys
the
position
of
miletus
was
too
strong
to
permit
of
its
being
carried
by
a
de
besides
which
the
lydians
were
unwilling
to
destroy
at
one
blow
a
town
whose
colonies
skilfully
planted
at
the
seaports
from
the
coasts
of
the
black
sea
to
those
of
egypt
would
one
day
furnish
them
with
so
many
outlets
for
their
industrial
products
their
method
of
attacking
it
resolved
itself
into
a
series
of
exhausting
raids
year
as
soon
as
the
fruit
crops
and
the
harvests
began
to
ripen
alyattes
set
out
at
the
head
of
his
troops
whom
he
caused
to
march
and
encamp
to
the
sound
of
instruments
having
arrived
in
the
milesian
territory
he
completely
destroyed
the
crops
and
the
orchards
and
then
again
in
these
expeditions
he
was
careful
to
avoid
any
excesses
which
would
have
made
the
injury
inflicted
appear
irretrievable
his
troops
were
forbidden
to
destroy
or
buildings
dedicated
to
the
gods
indeed
on
one
occasion
when
the
conflagration
which
consumed
the
lands
accidentally
spread
to
the
temple
of
athena
near
assêsos
he
rebuilt
two
temples
for
the
goddess
at
his
own
expense
the
milesians
sustained
the
struggle
courageously
until
two
reverses
at
limeneion
and
in
the
plain
of
the
maeander
at
length
induced
them
to
make
terms
their
tyrant
thrasybulus
acting
on
the
advice
of
the
delphic
apollo
and
by
the
mediation
of
periander
of
corinth
concluded
a
treaty
with
alyattes
in
which
the
two
princes
declaring
themselves
the
guest
and
the
ally
one
of
the
other
very
probably
conceded
extensive
commercial
privileges
to
one
another
both
by
land
and
sea
stratagem
is
said
to
have
taken
place
at
priênê
by
diogenes
laertes
and
by
polysenus
the
war
begins
under
ardys
lasts
for
five
years
under
sadyattes
instead
of
the
six
years
which
herodotus
attributes
to
it
and
five
years
under
alyattes
alyattes
rewarded
the
oracle
by
the
gift
of
a
magnificent
bowl
the
work
of
glaucus
of
chios
which
continued
to
be
shown
to
travellers
of
the
roman
period
as
one
of
the
most
remarkable
curiosities
of
delphi
alyattes
continued
his
expeditions
against
the
other
greek
colonies
but
directed
them
prudently
and
leisurely
so
as
not
to
alarm
his
european
friends
and
provoke
the
formation
against
himself
of
a
coalition
of
the
hellenic
communities
shattered
over
the
isles
or
along
the
littoral
of
the
ægean
we
know
that
towards
the
end
of
his
reign
he
recovered
colophon
which
had
been
previously
acquired
by
gyges
but
had
regained
its
independence
during
the
cimmerian
crisis
he
razed
smyrna
to
the
ground
and
forced
its
inhabitants
to
occupy
unfortified
towns
where
his
suzerainty
could
not
be
disputed
he
half
devastated
clazomense
whose
citizens
saved
it
by
a
despairing
effort
and
he
renewed
the
ancient
alliances
with
ephesus
kymê
and
the
cities
of
the
region
of
the
caicus
and
the
hellespont
though
it
is
impossible
to
attribute
an
accurate
date
to
each
of
these
particular
events
polysenus
tells
the
story
of
the
trick
by
which
alyattes
after
he
had
treated
with
the
people
of
colophon
destroyed
their
cavalry
and
seized
on
their
town
the
fact
that
a
treaty
was
made
seems
to
be
confirmed
by
a
fragment
of
phylarchus
and
the
surrender
of
the
town
to
the
lydians
by
a
fragment
of
xenophanes
quoted
in
athenseus
schubert
does
not
seem
to
believe
that
the
town
was
taken
by
alyattes
i
have
adopted
the
opinion
of
ladet
on
this
point
herodotus
and
nicolas
of
damascus
confine
themselves
to
relating
the
capture
of
the
city
adds
that
the
lydians
compelled
the
inhabitants
to
dwell
in
unfortified
towns
schubert
thinks
that
the
passage
in
strabo
refers
not
to
the
time
of
alyattes
but
to
a
subsequent
event
in
the
fifth
century
he
relies
for
this
opinion
on
a
fragment
of
pindar
which
represents
smyrna
as
still
flourishing
in
his
time
but
as
busolt
has
pointed
out
the
intention
of
the
text
of
pindar
is
to
represent
the
state
of
the
city
at
about
the
time
of
birth
and
not
in
the
fifth
century
the
peace
between
ephesus
and
lydia
must
have
been
troubled
for
a
little
while
in
the
reign
of
sadyattes
but
it
was
confirmed
under
alyattes
by
the
marriage
of
melas
ii
with
one
of
the
daughters
most
of
them
had
already
taken
place
or
were
still
proceeding
when
the
irruption
of
the
medes
across
the
halys
obliged
him
to
concentrate
all
his
energies
on
the
eastern
portion
of
his
kingdom
the
current
tradition
in
lydia
of
a
century
later
attributed
the
conflict
of
the
two
peoples
to
a
romantic
cause
it
related
that
cyaxares
had
bestowed
his
favour
on
the
bands
of
scythians
who
had
become
his
mercenaries
on
the
death
of
madyes
and
that
he
had
entrusted
to
them
the
children
of
some
of
the
noblest
medic
families
that
they
might
train
them
to
hunt
and
also
teach
them
the
use
of
the
bow
one
day
on
their
returning
from
the
chase
without
any
game
cyaxares
reproached
them
for
their
want
of
skill
in
such
angry
and
insulting
terms
that
they
resolved
on
immediate
revenge
they
cut
one
of
the
children
in
pieces
which
they
dressed
after
the
same
manner
as
that
in
which
they
were
accustomed
to
prepare
the
game
they
had
killed
and
served
up
the
dish
to
the
king
then
while
he
was
feasting
upon
it
with
his
courtiers
they
lied
in
haste
and
took
refuge
with
alyattes
the
latter
welcomed
them
and
refused
to
send
them
back
to
cyaxares
hence
the
outbreak
of
hostilities
it
is
of
course
possible
that
the
emigration
of
a
nomad
horde
may
have
been
the
cause
of
the
war
but
graver
reasons
than
this
had
set
the
two
nations
at
variance
grote
has
collected
a
certain
number
of
examples
in
later
times
to
show
that
the
journeying
of
a
nomad
horde
from
one
state
to
another
may
provoke
wars
and
he
concludes
therefrom
that
at
least
the
basis
of
account
may
be
considered
as
true
the
hardworking
inhabitants
of
the
valleys
of
the
iris
and
the
halys
were
still
possessed
of
considerable
riches
in
spite
of
the
losses
they
had
suffered
from
the
avaricious
cimmerians

their
chief

these
seem
to
me
to
have
been
executed
at
about
the
time
with
which
we
are
dealing
or
perhaps
a
few
years
later
in
any
case
before
the
persian
conquest
pteria
and
its
surrounding

formed
a
kind
of
natural
fortress
which
overlooked
the
whole

the

constituted
in
the
land
of
the
lydians
an
outpost

effectually
protected
their
possessions
in
phrygia
and
papnlagonia
against
an
attack
from
the
east
in
the
hands
of
the
medes
it
would
be
a
dominant
position
which
would
counteract
the
defensive
features
of
the
halys
and
from
it
they
might
penetrate
into
the
heart
of
asia
minor
without
encountering
any
serious
obstacles
the
struggle
between
the
two
sovereigns
was
not
so
unequal
as
might
at
first
appear
no
doubt
the
army
of
alyattes
was
inferior
in
numbers
but
the
bravery
of
its
component
forces
and
the
ability
of
its
leaders
compensated
for
its
numerical
inferiority
and
cyaxares
had
no
troop
to
be
compared
with
the
carian
lancers
with
the
hoplites
of
ionia
or
with
the
heavy
mæonian
cavalry
during
six
years
the
two
armies
met
again
and
again
fate
sometimes
favouring
one
and
sometimes
the
other
and
were
about
to
try
their
fortune
once
more
after
several
indecisive
engagements
when
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
suspended
operations
the
iranian
peoples
would
fight
only
in
full
daylight
and
their
adversaries
although
warned
so
it
is
said
by
the
milesian
philosopher
thaïes
of
the
phenomenon
about
to
take
place
in
the
heavens
were
perhaps
not
completely
reassured
as
to
its
significance
and
the
two
hosts
accordingly
separated
without
coming
to
blows
this
eclipse
was
identified
at
one
time
with
that
of
at
another
with
that
of
may
the
latter
of
these
two
dates
appears
to
me
to
be
the
correct
one
and
is
the
only
one
which
agrees
with
what
we
know
of
the
general
history
of
the
sixth
century
nebuchadrezzar
had
followed
not
without
some
misgivings
the
vicissitudes
of
the
campaign
and
his
anxiety
was
shared
by
the
independent
princes
of
asia
minor
who
were
allies
of
the
lydians
he
and
they
alike
awaited
with
dread
a
decisive
action
which
by
crushing
one
of
the
belligerents
beyond
hope
of
recovery
would
leave
the
onlookers
at
the
mercy
of
the
victor
in
the
full
flush
of
his
success
tradition
relates
that
syennesis
of
cilicia
and
the
babylonian
nabonidus
had
taken
advantage
of
the
alarm
produced
by
the
eclipse
to
negotiate
an
armistice
and
that
they
were
soon
successful
in
bringing
the
rival
powers
to
an
agreement
the
halys
remained
the
recognised
frontier
of
the
two
kingdoms
but
the
lydians
probably
obtained
advantages
for
their
commerce
which
they
regarded
as
compensatory
for
the
abandonment
of
their
claim
to
the
district
of
pteria
to
strengthen
the
alliance
it
was
agreed
that
alyattes
should
give
his
daughter
aryenis
in
marriage
to
ishtuvigu
or
as
the
greeks
called
him
astyages
the
son
of
cyaxares
according
to
the
custom
of
the
times
the
two
contracting
parties
after
taking
the
vow
of
fidelity
sealed
the
compact
by
pricking
each
arms
and
sucking
the
few
drops
of
blood
which
oozed
from
the
puncture
the
name
labynetos
given
by
herodotus
is
a
transcript
of
nabonidus
but
can
not
here
designate
the
babylonian
king
of
that
name
for
the
latter
reigned
more
than
thirty
years
after
the
peace
was
concluded
between
the
lydians
and
the
medes
if
herodotus
has
not
made
the
mistake
of
putting
labynetos
for
nebuchadrezzar
we
may
admit
that
this
labynetos
was
a
prince
of
the
royal
family
or
simply
a
general
who
was
commanding
the
chaldoan
auxiliaries
of
cyaxares
the
form
ishtuvigu
is
given
us
by
the
chaldoan
documents
its
exact
transcript
was
astuigas
astyigas
according
to
ctosias
in
fact
this
coincides
so
remarkably
with
the
babylonian
mode
of
spelling
that
we
may
believe
that
it
faithfully
reproduces
the
original
pronunciation
many
ancient
authors
have
spoken
of
this
war
or
at
least
of
the
eclipse
which
brought
it
to
an
end
several
of
them
place
the
conclusion
of
peace
not
in
the
reign
of
cyaxares
but
in
that
of
astyages
cicero
solinus
and
the
armenian
eusebius
and
their
view
has
been
adopted
by
some
modern
historians
the
two
versions
of
the
account
can
be
reconciled
by
saying
that
astyages
was
commanding
the
median
army
instead
of
his
father
who
was
too
old
to
do
so
but
such
an
explanation
is
unnecessary
and
cyaxares
though
over
seventy
might
still
have
had
sufficient
vigour
to
wage
war
the
substitution
of
astyages
for
cyaxares
by
the
authors
of
roman
times
was
probably
effected
with
the
object
of
making
the
date
of
the
eclipse
agree
with
a
different
system
of
chronology
from
that
followed
by
herodotus
cyaxares
died
in
the
following
year
full
of
days
and
renown
and
was
at
once
succeeded
by
astyages
few
princes
could
boast
of
having
had
such
a
successful
career
as
his
even
in
that
century
of
unprecedented
fortunes
and
boundless
ambitions
inheriting
a
disorganised
army
proclaimed
king
in
the
midst
of
mourning
on
the
morrow
of
a
defeat
in
which
the
fate
of
his
kingdom
had
hung
in
the
balance
he
succeeded
within
a
quarter
of
a
century
in
overthrowing
his
enemies
and
substituting
his
supremacy
for
theirs
throughout
the
whole
of
western
asia
at
his
accession
media
had
occupied
only
a
small
portion
of
the
iranian
at
his
death
the
median
empire
extended
to
the
banks
of
the
halys
it
is
now
not
difficult
to
understand
why
nebuchadrezzar
abstained
from
all
expeditions
in
the
regions
of
the
taurus
as
well
as
in
those
of
the
upper
tigris
he
would
inevitably
have
come
into
contact
with
the
allies
of
the
lydians
perchance
with
the
lydians
themselves
or
with
the
medes
as
the
case
might
be
and
he
would
have
been
drawn
on
to
take
an
active
part
in
their
dangerous
quarrels
from
which
after
all
he
could
not
hope
to
reap
any
personal
advantage
in
reality
there
was
one
field
of
action
only
open
to
him
and
that
was
southern
syria
with
egypt
in
her
rear
he
found
himself
at
this
extreme
limit
of
his
dominions
in
a
political
situation
almost
identical
with
that
of
his
assyrian
predecessors
and
consequently
more
or
less
under
the
obligation
of
repeating
their
policy
the
saites
like
the
ethiopians
before
them
could
enjoy
no
assured
sense
of
security
in
the
delta
when
they
knew
that
they
had
a
great
military
state
as
their
nearest
neighbour
on
the
other
side
of
the
isthmus
they
felt
with
reason
that
the
thirty
leagues
of
desert
which
separated
pelusium
from
gaza
was
an
insufficient
protection
from
invasion
and
they
desired
to
have
between
themselves
and
their
adversary
a
tract
of
country
sufficiently
extensive
to
ward
off
the
first
blows
in
the
case
of
hostilities
if
such
a
buffer
territory
could
be
composed
of
feudal
provinces
or
tributary
states
egyptian
pride
would
be
flattered
while
at
the
same
time
the
security
of
the
kingdom
would
be
increased
and
indeed
the
victorious
progress
of
necho
had
for
the
moment
changed
their
most
ambitious
dreams
into
realities
driven
back
into
the
nile
valley
after
the
battle
of
carchemish
their
pretensions
had
immediately
shrunk
within
more
modest
limits
their
aspirations
were
now
confined
to
gaining
the
confidence
of
the
few
surviving
states
which
had
preserved
some
sort
of
independence
in
spite
of
the
assyrian
conquest
to
detaching
them
from
chaldoan
interests
and
making
them
into
a
protecting
zone
against
the
ambition
of
a
new
esarhaddon
to
this
work
necho
applied
himself
as
soon
as
nebuchadrezzar
had
left
him
in
order
to
hasten
back
to
babylon
the
egyptian
monarch
belonged
to
a
persevering
race
who
were
never
kept
down
by
reverses
and
had
not
once
allowed
themselves
to
be
discouraged
during
the
whole
of
the
century
in
which
they
had
laboured
to
secure
the
crown
for
themselves
his
defeat
had
not
lessened
his
tenacity
nor
it
would
seem
his
certainty
of
final
success
besides
organising
his
egyptian
and
libyan
troops
he
enrolled
a
still
larger
number
of
hellenic
mercenaries
correctly
anticipating
that
the
restless
spirits
of
the
phoenicians
and
jews
would
soon
furnish
him
with
an
opportunity
of
distinguishing
himself
upon
the
scene
of
action
it
was
perhaps
at
this
juncture
that
he
decided
to
strengthen
his
position
by
the
of
a
fleet
the
superiority
of
the
chaldoan
battalions
had
been
so
clearly
manifested
that
he
could
scarcely
hope
for
a
decisive
victory
if
he
persisted
in
seeking
it
on
land
but
if
he
could
succeed
in
securing
the
command
of
the
sea
his
galleys
by
continually
cruising
along
the
syrian
coast
and
conveying
troops
provisions
arms
and
money
to
the
phoenician
towns
would
so
successfully
foster
and
maintain
a
spirit
of
rebellion
that
the
chaldæans
would
not
dare
to
venture
into
egypt
until
they
had
dealt
with
this
source
of
danger
in
their
rear
he
therefore
set
to
work
to
increase
the
number
of
his
on
the
bed
sea
but
more
especially
on
the
mediterranean
and
as
he
had
drawn
upon
greece
for
his
troops
he
now
applied
to
her
for
shipbuilders
herodotus
tells
us
that
in
his
time
the
ruins
of
the
docks
which
necho
had
made
for
the
building
of
his
triremes
could
still
be
seen
on
the
shore
of
the
red
sea
as
well
as
on
that
of
the
mediterranean
he
seems
also
to
say
that
the
building
of
the
fleet
was
anterior
to
the
first
syrian
expedition

invented
by
either
the
samian
or
corinthian
naval

had
as
yet
been
little
used
and
possibly
herodotus
is
attributing
an
event
of
his
own
time
to
this
earlier
period
when
he
affirms
that
necho
filled
a
dockyard
with
a
whole
fleet
of
these
vessels
he
possessed
at
any
rate
a
considerable
number
of
them
and
along
with
them
other
vessels
of
various
build
in
which
the
blunt
stem
and
curved
poop
of
the
greeks
were
combined
with
the
barque
of
the
egyptians

the

time
in
order
to
transport
the
squadron
from
one
sea
to
another
when
occasion
demanded
he
endeavoured
to
reopen
the
ancient
canal
he
improved
its
course
and
widened
it

as
to
permit
of

the
narrow

which
this
sheet
of

was
anciently
connected
with
the
gulf
of

was
probably
obstructed
in
places
and
required
clearing
out
at
several
points
if
not
along
its
entire
extent
a
later
tradition
states
that
after
having
lost
men
in
attempting
this
task
the
king
abandoned
the
project
on
the
advice
of
an
oracle
a
god
having
been
supposed
to
have
predicted
to
him
that
he
was
working
for
the
barbarians

are
evidently
exaggerated
for

a
similar
undertaking

was

of
enterprises

the

of

for
ever
in
the
memory
of
the
people
the

had
discovered
on
the
ocean
coast
of
libya
a
country
rich
in
gold
ivory
precious
woods
pepper
and
spices
but
their
political
jealousy
prevented
other
nations
from
following
in
their
wake
in
the
interests
of
trade
the
egyptians
possibly
may
have
undertaken
to
dispute
their
monopoly
or
the
phoenicians
may
have
desired
to
reach
their
colony
by
a
less
frequented
highway
than
the
mediterranean
the
merchants
of
the
said
and
the
delta
had
never
entirely
lost
touch
with
the
people
dwelling
on
the
shores
of
the
red
sea
and
though
the
royal
fleets
no
longer
pursued
their
course
down
it
on
their
way
to
punt
as
in
the
days
of
hâtshopsîtu
and
ramses
private

ventured
from
time
to

to
open

communications
with
the
ancient
of
necho
despatched
the
phoenician
captains
of
his
fleet
in
search
of
new
lands
and
they
started
from
the
neighbourhood
of
suez
probably
accompanied
by
native
pilots
accustomed
to
navigate
in
those
waters
the
undertaking
fraught
with
difficulty
even
in
the
last
century
was
indeed
a
formidable
one
for
the
small
vessels
of
the
saite
period
they
sailed
south
for
months
with
the
east
to
the
left
of
them
and
on
their
right
the
continent
which
seemed
to
extend
indefinitely
before
them
towards
the
autumn
they
disembarked
on
some
convenient
shore
sowed
the
wheat
with
which
they
were
provided
and
waited
till
the
crop
was
ripe
having
reaped
the
harvest
they
again
took
to
the
sea
any
accurate
remembrance
of
what
they
saw
was
soon
effaced
they
could
merely
recollect
that
having
reached
a
certain
point
they
observed
with
astonishment
that
the
sun
appeared
to
have
reversed
its
course
and
now
rose
on
their
right
hand
this
meant
that
they
had
turned
the
southern
extremity
of
africa
and
were
unconsciously
sailing
northwards
in
the
third
year
they
passed
through
the
pillars
of
hercules
and
reached
egypt
in
safety
the
very
limited
knowledge
of
navigation
possessed
by
the
mariners
of
that
day
rendered
this
voyage
fruitless
the
dangerous
route
thus
opened
up
to
commerce
remained
unused
and
its
discovery
was
remembered
only
as
a
curious
feat
devoid
of
any
practical
use
the
greek
writers
after
herodotus
denied
the
possibility
of
such
a
voyage
and
they
thought
that
it
could
not
be
decided
whether
africa
was
entirely
surrounded
by
water
and
that
certainly
no
traveller
had
ever
journeyed
above
stadia
beyond
the
entrance
to
the
red
sea
modern
writers
are
divided
on
the
point
some
denying
and
others
maintaining
the
authenticity
of
the
account
the
observation
made
by
the
navigators
of
the
apparent
change
in
the
course
of
the
sun
which
herodotus
has
recorded
and
which
neither
he
nor
his
authorities
understood
seems
to
me
to
be
so
weighty
an
argument
for
its
authenticity
that
it
is
impossible
to
reject
the
tradition
until
we
have
more
decided
grounds
for
so
doing
in
order
to
obtain
any
practical
results
from
the
arduous
voyage
it
would
have
been
necessary
for
egypt
to
devote
a
considerable
part
of
its
resources
to
the
making
of
such
expeditions
whereas
the
country
preferred
to
concentrate
all
its
energies
on
its
tyrian
policy
necho
certainly
possessed
the
sympathies
of
the
tyrians
who
had
transferred
their
traditional
hatred
of
the
assyrians
to
the
chaldæans
he
could
also
count
with
equal
certainty
on
the
support
of
a
considerable
party
in
moab
ammon
and
edom
as
well
as
among
the
nabatæans
and
the
arabs
of
kedar
but
the
key
of
the
whole
position
lay
with
judah
that
ally
without
whom
none
of
other
partisans
would
venture
to
declare
openly
against
their
master
the
death
of
josiah
had
dealt
a
fatal
blow
to
the
hopes
of
the
prophets
and
even
long
after
the
event
they
could
not
recall
it
without
lamenting
the
fate
of
this
king
after
their
own
heart
like
unto
him
exclaims
their
chronicler
there
no
king
before
him
that
turned
to
the
lord
with
all
his
heart
and
with
all
his
soul
and
with
all
his
might
according
to
all
the
law
of
moses
neither
after
him
arose
there
any
like
kings
xxiii
the
events
which
followed
his
violent
death
the
deposition
of
jehoahaz
the
establishment
and
fall
of
the
egyptian
supremacy
the
proclamation
of
the
chaldæan
suzerainty
the
degradation
of
the
king
and
the
misery
of
the
people
brought
about
by
the
tribute
exacted
from
them
by
their
foreign
masters
all
these
revolutions
which
had
succeeded
each
other
without
break
or
respite
had
all
but
ruined
the
belief
in
the
efficacy
of
the
reform
due
to
discovery
and
preached
by
jeremiah
and
his
followers
the
people
saw
in
these
calamities
the
vengeance
of
jahveh
against
the
presumptuous
faction
which
had
overthrown
his
various
sanctuaries
and
had
attempted
to
confine
his
worship
to
a
single
temple
they
therefore
restored
the
banished
attractions
and
set
themselves
to
sacrifice
to
strange
gods
with
greater
zest
than
ever
a
like
crisis
occurred
and
like
party
divisions
had
broken
out
around
jehoiakim
similar
to
those
at
the
court
of
ahaz
and
hezekiah
a
century
earlier
the
populace
the
soldiery
and
most
of
the
court
officials
in
short
all
who
adhered
to
the
old
popular
form
of
religion
or
were
attracted
to
strange
devotions
hoped
to
rid
themselves
of
the
chaldæans
by
earthly
means
and
since
necho
declared
himself
an
implacable
enemy
of
their
foe
their
principal
aim
was
to
come
to
terms
with
egypt
jeremiah
on
the
contrary
and
those
who
remained
faithful
to
the
teaching
of
the
prophets
saw
in
all
that
was
passing
around
them
cogent
reasons
for
rejecting
worldly
wisdom
and
advice
and
for
yielding
themselves
unreservedly
to
the
divine
will
in
bowing
before
the
chaldæan
of
whom
jahveh
made
use
as
of
the
assyrian
of
old
to
chastise
the
sins
of
judah
the
struggle
between
the
two
factions
constantly
disturbed
the
public
peace
and
it
needed
little
to
cause
the
preaching
of
the
prophets
to
degenerate
into
an
incitement
to
revolt
on
a
which
occurred
in
the
early
months
of
reign
jeremiah
took
up
his
station
on
the
pavement
of
the
temple
and
loudly
apostrophised
the
crowd
of
worshippers
saith
the
lord
if
ye
will
not
hearken
unto
me
to
walk
in
my
law
which
i
have
set
before
you
to
hearken
to
the
words
of
my
servants
the
prophets
whom
i
send
unto
you
even
rising
up
early
and
sending
them
but
ye
have
not
hearkened
then
will
i
make
this
house
like
shiloh
and
will
make
this
city
a
curse
to
all
the
nations
of
the
such
a
speech
boldly
addressed
to
an
audience
the
majority
of
whom
were
already
moved
by
hostile
feelings
brought
their
animosity
to
a
climax
the
officiating
priests
the
prophets
and
the
pilgrims
gathered
round
jeremiah
crying
shalt
surely
the
people
thronged
into
the
temple
the
princes
of
judah
went
up
to
the
house
and
to
the
house
of
the
lord
and
sat
in
council
in
the
entry
of
the
new
gate
they
decreed
that
jeremiah
having
spoken
in
the
name
of
the
lord
did
not
merit
death
and
some
of
their
number
recalling
the
precedent
of
micaiah
the
morasthite
who
in
his
time
had
predicted
the
ruin
of
jerusalem
added
hezekiah
king
of
judah
and
all
judah
put
him
at
all
to
death
ahikam
the
son
of
shaphan
one
of
those
who
had
helped
in
restoring
the
law
took
the
prophet
under
his
protection
and
prevented
the
crowd
from
injuring
him
but
some
others
were
not
able
to
escape
the
popular
fury
the
prophet
uriah
of
who
unweariedly
prophesied
against
the
city
and
country
after
the
manner
of
jeremiah
fled
to
egypt
but
in
vain
jehoiakim
despatched
elnathan
the
son
of
achbor
certain
men
with
him
who
brought
him
back
to
judah
him
with
the
sword
and
cast
his
dead
body
into
the
graves
of
the
common
if
popular
feeling
had
reached
such
a
pitch
before
the
battle
of
carchemish
to
what
height
must
it
have
risen
when
the
news
of
victory
had
given
the
to
the
hopes
of
the
egyptian
faction
jeremiah
believed
the
moment
ripe
for
forcibly
arresting
the
popular
imagination
while
it
was
swayed
by
the
panic
of
anticipated
invasion
he
dictated
to
his
disciple
baruch
the
prophecies
he
had
pronounced
since
the
appearance
of
the
scythians
under
josiah
and
on
the
day
of
the
solemn
fast
proclaimed
throughout
judah
during
the
winter
of
the
fifth
year
of
the
reign
a
few
months
after
the
defeat
of
the
egyptians
he
caused
the
writing
to
be
read
to
the
assembled
people
at
the
entry
of
the
new
gate
jer
where
the
scene
takes
place
at
the
beginning
of
reign
under
the
egyptian
domination
the
date
given
in
jer
xxxvi
makes
the
year
begin
in
spring
since
the
ninth
month
occurs
in
winter
this
date
belongs
therefore
to
the
later
recensions
of
the
text
it
is
nevertheless
probably
authentic
representing
the
exact
equivalent
of
the
original
date
according
to
the
old
calendar
micaiah
the
son
of
gremariah
was
among
those
who
listened
and
noting
that
the
audience
were
moved
by
the
denunciations
which
revived
the
memory
of
their
recent
misfortunes
he
hastened
to
inform
the
ministers
sitting
in
council
within
the
palace
of
what
was
passing
they
at
once
sent
for
baruch
and
begged
him
to
repeat
to
them
what
he
had
read
they
were
so
much
alarmed
at
its
recital
that
they
advised
him
to
hide
himself
in
company
with
jeremiah
while
they
informed
the
king
of
the
matter
jehoiakim
was
sitting
in
a
chamber
with
a
brazier
burning
before
him
on
account
of
the
severe
cold
scarcely
had
they
read
three
or
four
pages
before
him
when
his
anger
broke
forth
he
seized
the
roll
slashed
it
with
the
penknife
and
threw
the
fragments
into
the
fire
jeremiah
recomposed
the
text
from
memory
and
inserted
in
it
a
malediction
against
the
king
saith
the
lord
concerning
jehoiakim
king
of
judah
he
shall
have
none
to
sit
upon
the
throne
of
david
and
his
dead
body
shall
be
cast
out
in
the
day
to
the
heat
and
in
the
night
to
the
frost
and
i
will
punish
him
and
his
seed
and
his
servants
for
their
iniquity
and
i
will
bring
upon
them
and
upon
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
and
upon
the
men
of
judah
all
the
evil
that
i
have
pronounced
against
them
but
they
hearkened

attempts
have
been
made
to
reconstruct
the
contents
of

and
most
of
the
authors
who
have
dealt
with
this
subject
think
that
the
roll
contained
the
greater
part
of
the
fragments
which
in
the
book
of
the
prophet
occupy
chaps

xvii
xix
which
it
must
be
admitted
have
not
in
every
case
been
preserved
in
their
original
form
but
have
been
abridged
or
rearranged
after
the
exile
other
chapters
evidently
belong
to
the
years
previous
to
the
fifth
year
of
jehoiakim
as
well
as
part
of
the
prophecies
against
the
barbarians
but
they
could
not
have
been
included
in
the
original
roll
as
the
latter
would
then
have
been
too
long
to
have
been
read
three
times
in
one
day
the
egyptian
tendencies
evinced
at
court
at
first
discreetly
veiled
were
now
accentuated
to
such
a
degree
that
nebuchadrezzar
became
alarmed
and
came
in
person
to
jerusalem
in
the
year
his
presence
frustrated
the
intrigues
of
pharaoh
jehoiakim
was
reduced
to
order
for
a
time
but
three
years
later
he
revolted
afresh
at
the
instigation
of
necho
and
this
time
the
chaldæan
satraps
opened
hostilities
in
earnest
they
assembled
their
troops
which
were
reinforced
by
syrian
moabite
and
ammonite
contingents
and
laid
siege
to
jerusalem
kings
xxiv
the
passage
is
not
easy
to
be
understood
as
it
stands
and
it
has
been
differently
interpreted
by
historians
some
have
supposed
that
it
refers
to
events
immediately
following
the
battle
of
carchemish
and
that
jehoiakim
defended
jerusalem
against
nebuchadrezzar
in
others
think
that
after
the
battle
of
carchemish
jehoiakim
took
advantage
of
being
obliged
to
return
at
once
to
babylon
and
would
not
recognise
the
authority
of
the
chaldæans
that
nebuchadrezzar
returned
later
towards
and
took
jerusalem
and
that
it
is
to
this
second
war
that
allusion
is
made
in
the
book
of
kings
it
is
more
simple
to
consider
that
which

about

with
such
determination
that
nebuchadrezzar
was
obliged
to
bring
up
his
chaldæan
forces
to
assist
in
the
attack
judah
trembled
with
fear
at
the
mere
description
which
her
prophet
habakkuk
gave
of
this
fierce
and
sturdy
people
march
through
the
breadth
of
the
earth
to
possess
which
are
not
theirs
they
are
terrible
and
dreadful
their
judgment
and
their
dignity
proceed
from
themselves
their
horses
also
are
swifter
than
leopards
and
are
more
fierce
than
the
evening
wolves
and
their
horsemen
spread
themselves
yea
their
horsemen
come
from
far
they
fly
as
an
eagle
that
hasteneth
to
devour
they
come
all
of
them
for
violence
their
faces
are
set
eagerly
as
the
east

and
they
gather
captives
as
the

yea
he
scoffeth
at
kings
and
princes
are
a
derision
unto
him
he
derideth
every
stronghold
for
he
heapeth
up
dust
and
taketh
it
then
shall
he
sweep
by
as
a
wind
and
shall
pass
over
the
guilty
even
he
whose
might
is
his
army
must
have
presented
a
spectacle
as
strange
as
did
that
of
necho
it
contained
besides
its
nucleus
of
chaldæn
and
babylonian
infantry
squadrons
of
scythian
and
median
cavalry
whose
cruelty
it
was
no
doubt
that
had
alarmed
the
prophet

certainly
bands
of
greek

the

had
a

service
jehoiakim
died
before
the
enemy
appeared
beneath
the
walls
of
jerusalem
and
was
at
once
succeeded
by
his
son
jeconiah
a
youth
of
eighteen
years
who
assumed
the
name

where
the
writer
says
that
nebuchadrezzar
bound
jehoiakim
fetters
to
carry
him
to
the
new
king
continued
the
struggle
at
first
courageously
but
the
advent
of
nebuchadrezzar
so
clearly
convinced
him
of
the
futility
of
the
defence
that
he
suddenly
decided
to
lay
down
his
arms
he
came
forth
from
the
city
with
his
mother
nehushta
the
officers
of
his
house
his
ministers
and
his
eunuchs
and
prostrated
himself
at
the
feet
of
his
suzerain
the
chaldæn
monarch
was
not
inclined
to
proceed
to
extremities
he
therefore
exiled
to
babylon
jehoiachin
and
the
whole
of
his
seditious
court
who
had
so
the
young
king
the
best
of
his
officers
and
the
most
skilful
artisans
in
all
persons
but
the
priests
and
the
bulk
of
the
people
remained
at
jerusalem
the
conqueror
appointed
mattaniah
the
youngest
son
of
josiah
to
be
their
ruler
who
on
succeeding
to
the
crown
changed
his
name
after
the
example
of
his
predecessors
adopting
that
of
zedekiah
jehoiachin
had
reigned
exactly
three
months
over
his
besieged
city
the
egyptians
made
no
attempt
to
save
their
ally
but
if
they
felt
themselves
not
in
a
condition
to
defy
the
chaldasans
on
syrian
territory
the
chaldaeans
on
their
side
feared
to
carry
hostilities
into
the
heart
of
the
delta
necho
died
two
years
after
the
disaster
at
jerusalem
without
having
been
called
to
account
by
or
having
found
an
opportunity
of
further
annoying
his
rival
and
his
son
psammetichus

succeeded
peacefully
to
the
throne
he
was
a
youth
at
this
time
and
his
ministers
conducted
the
affairs
of

on
his

it
was

who

of

the
length
of

is
fixed
at
sixteen
years
by
herodotus
and
at
six
or
at
nine
years
by
the
various
abbreviators
of
manetho
the
contemporaneous
monuments
have
confirmed
the
testimony
of
herodotus
on
this
point
as
against
that
of
manetho
and
the
stelse
of
the
florentine
museum
of
the
leyden
museum
and
of
the
louvre
have
furnished
certain
proof
that
necho
died
in

sixteenth
year
after
fifteen
and
a
half
reign
his
sarcophagus
discovered
in

now
preserved

that
it

have

the
first
to

his
opinion
has
gained
ground
since

the
alysian
graffito
contains
the
greek
translation
of
the
current
egyptian
phrase
his
majesty
came
on
his
first
military
expedition
into
this
country
which
seems
to
point
to
no
very
early
date
in
a
reign
for
a
first
campaign
moreover
one
of
the
generals
in
command
of
the
expedition
is
a
psammetichus
son
of
theocles
that
is
a
greek
with
an
egyptian
name
a
considerable
lapse
of
time
must
have
taken
place
since
first
dealings
with
the
greeks
for
otherwise
the
person
named
after
the
king
would
not
have
been
of
sufficiently
mature
age
to
be
put
at
the
head
of
a
body
of
troops
they
organised
a
small
army
for
him
composed
of
egyptians
greeks
and
asiatic
mercenaries
which
while
the
king
was
taking
up
his
residence
at
elephantine
was
borne
up
the
nile
in
a
fleet
of
large
vessels
it
probably
went
as
far
south
as
the
northern
point
of
the
second
cataract
and
not
having
encountered
any
ethiopian
force
it
retraced
its
course
and
came
to
anchor
at
the
chief
graffito
at
says
in
fact
that
the
king
came
to
elephantine
and
that
only
the
troops
accompanying
the
general
psammetichus
the
son
of
theocles
went
beyond
kerkis
it
was
probably
during
his
stay
at
elephantine
while
awaiting
the
return
of
the
expedition
that
psammetichus
ii
had
the
inscriptions
containing
his
cartouches
engraved
upon
the
rocks
of
bigga
abaton
philo
and
konosso
or
among
the
ruins
of
elephantine
and
of
phila
the
greek
inscription
says
wiedemann
has
corrected
into
the
korte
of
the
first
cataract
but
the
reading
kerkis
is
too
well
established
for
there
to
be
any
reason
for
change
the
simplest
explanation
is
to
acknowledge
that
the
inscription
refers
to
a
place
situated
a
few
miles
above
towards
the
officers
in
command
after
having
admired
the
chapel
of

that

he
therefore
established
himself

position

whence
he
could
observe
the
progress
of
the
operations
and
hasten
with
his
reserve

to
a
threatened
point
in
the
case
of
unforeseen
difficulties
having
done
this
he
despatched
the
two
divisions
of
his
army
against
his
two
principal
adversaries

of
these
divisions
crossed

lebanon
seized
its
fortresses

record
of
its
victories
on
the
rocks

made

way
southwards
along

coast
to

the
account
of
this
phoenician
campaign
is
contained
in
one
of
the
inscriptions
discovered
and
commented
on
by
pognon
winckler
the
only
one
to
my
knowledge
who
has
tried
to
give
a
precise
chronological
position
to
the
events
recorded
in
the
inscription
places
them
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
reign
after
the
victory
of
carchemish
about
the
time
when
nebuchadrezzar
heard
that
his
father
had
just
died
i
think
that
this
date
is
not
justified
by
the
study
of
the
inscription
for
the
king
speaks
therein
of
the
great
works
that
he
had
accomplished
the
restoration
of
the
temples
the
rebuilding
of
the
walls
of
babylon
and
the
digging
of
canals
all
of
which
take
us
to
the
middle
or
the
end
of
his
reign
we
are
therefore
left
to
choose
between
one
of
two
dates
namely
that
of
during
the
jewish
war
and
that
from
the
year
to
during
the
war
against
amasis
which
will
be
treated
below
i
have
chosen
the
first
because
of
long
sojourn
at
riblah
which
gave
him
sufficient
time
for
the
engraving
of
the
stelse
on
lebanon
the
of
wady
brissa
could
have
been
cut
before
the
taking
of
jerusalem
for
no
allusion
to
the
war
against
the
jews
is
found
in
them
the
enemy
mentioned
in
the
opening
lines
is
perhaps
apries
whose
fleet
was
scouring
the
phoenician
coasts
the
other
force
bore
down
upon
zedekiah
and
made
war
upon
him
ruthlessly
it
burnt
the
villages
and
unwalled
towns
gave
the
rural
districts
over
as
a
prey
to
the
philistines
and
the
edomites
surrounded
the
two
fortresses
of
lachish
and
azekah
and
only
after
completely
exhausting
the
provinces
appeared
before
the
walls
of
the
capital
jerusalem
was
closely
beset
when
the
news
reached
the
chaldæans
that
apries
was
approaching
gaza
zedekiah
in
his
distress
appealed
to
him
for
help
and
the
promised
succour
at
length
came
upon
the
scene
the
chaldæans
at
once
raised
the
siege
with
the
object
of
arresting
the
advancing
enemy
and
the
popular
party
reckoning
already
on
a
chaldean
defeat
gave
way
to
insolent
rejoicing
over
the
prophets
of
evil
jeremiah
however
had
no
hope
of
final
success
not
yourselves
saying
the
chaldæans
shall
surely
depart
from
us
for
they
shall
not
depart
for
though
ye
had
smitten
the
whole
army
of
the
chaldeans
that
fight
against
you
and
there
remained
but
wounded
men
among
them
yet
should
they
rise
up
every
man
in
his
tent
and
burn
this
city
with
what
actually
took
place
is
not
known
according
to
one
account
apries
accepted
battle
and
was
defeated
according
to
another
he
refused
to
be
drawn
into
an
engagement
and
returned
haughtily
to
egypt
that
at
least
is
what
jeremiah
seems
to
say
xxxvii
army
which
is
come
forth
to
help
you
shall
return
to
egypt
into
their
own
there
is
no
hint
here
of
defeat
or
even
of
a
battle
his
fleet
probably
made
some
effective
raiding
on
the
phoenician
coast
it
is
easy
to
believe
that
the
sight
of
the
chaldoan
camp
inspired
him
with
prudence
and
that
he
thought
twice
before
compromising
the
effects
of
his
naval
campaign
and
risking
the
loss
of
his
fine
army
the
only
one
which
egypt
possessed
in
a
conflict
in
which
his
own
safety
was
not
directly
concerned
nebuchadrezzar
on
his
side
was
not
anxious
to
pursue
so
strongly
equipped
an
adversary
too
hotly
and
deeming
himself
fortunate
in
having
escaped
the
ordeal
of
a
trial
of
strength
with
him
he
returned
to
his
position
before
the
walls
of
jerusalem
the
city
receiving
no
further
succour
its
fall
was
merely
a
question
of
time
and
resistance
served
merely
to
irritate
the
besiegers
the
jews
nevertheless
continued
to
defend
it
with
the
heroic
obstinacy
and
at
the
same
time
with
the
frenzied
discord
of
which
they
have
so
often
shown
themselves
capable
during
the
respite
which
the
diversion
caused
by
apries
afforded
them
jeremiah
had
attempted
to
flee
from
jerusalem
and
seek
refuge
in
benjamin
to
which
tribe
he
belonged
arrested
at
the
city
gate
on
the
pretext
of
treason
he
was
unmercifully
beaten

into
prison

the
king
who
had
begun
to
believe
in
him
did
not
venture
to
deliver
him
he
was
confined
in

court

palace
which
served
as
a
gaol
and
allowed
a

bread

daily
the
courtyard
was
a
public
place
to
which
all
comers
had
access
who
desired
to
speak
to
the
prisoners
and
even
here
the
prophet
did
not
cease
to
preach
and
exhort
the
people
to
repentance
that
abideth
in
this
city
shall
die
by
the
sword
by
the
famine
and
by
the
pestilence
but
he
that
goeth
forth
to
the
chaldæans
shall
live
and
his
life
shall
be
unto
him
for
a
prey
and
he
shall
live
thus
saith
the
lord
this
city
shall
surely
be
given
into
the
hand
of

spoken
unto
us
in
the
name
of
the
lord
we
will
not
hearken
unto
thee
but
we
will
certainly
perform
every
word
that
is
gone
forth
out
of
our
mouth
to
burn
incense
unto
the
queen
of
heaven
and
to
pour
out
drink
offerings
unto
her
as
we
have
done
we
and
our
fathers
our
kings
and
our
princes
in
the
cities
of
judah
and
in
the
streets
of
jerusalem
for
then
had
we
plenty
of
victuals
and
were
well
and
saw
no
evil
but
since
we
left
off
to
burn
incense
to
the
queen
of
heaven
and
to
pour
out
drink
offerings
unto
her
we
have
wanted
all
things
and
have
been
consumed
by
the
sword
and
by
the
there
still
remained
to
these
misguided
jews
one
consolation
which
they
shared
in
common
with
the
prophets
the
certainty
of
seeing
the
hereditary
foes
of
israel
involved
in
the
common
overthrow
ammon
had
been
already
severely
chastised
tyre
cut
off
from
the
neighbouring
mainland
seemed
on
the
point
of
succumbing
and
the
turn
of
egypt
must
surely
soon
arrive
in
which
she
would
have
to
expiate
in
bitter
sufferings
the
wrongs
her
evil
counsels
had
brought
upon
jerusalem
their
anticipated
joy
however
of
witnessing
such
chastisements
was
not
realised
tyre
defied
for
thirteen
years
the
blockade
of
nebuchadrezzar
and
when
the
city
at
length
decided
to
capitulate
it
was
on
condition
that
its
king
ethbaal
should
continue
to
reign
under
the
almost
nominal
suzerainty
of
the
chaldeans
the
majority
of
christian
writers
have
imagined
contrary
to
the
testimony
of
the
phoenician
annals
that
the
island
of
tyre
was
taken
by
nebuchadrezzar
they
say
that
the
chaldæans
united
the
island
to
the
mainland
by
a
causeway
similar
to
that
constructed
subsequently
by
alexander
it
is
worthy
of
notice
that
a
local
tradition
still
existing
in
the
eleventh
century
of
our
era
asserted
that
the
besiegers
were
not
successful
in
their
enterprise
egypt
continued
not
only
to
preserve
her
independence
but
seemed
to
increase
in
prosperity
in
proportion
to
the
intensity
of
the
hatred
which
she

stirred
up

apries
was
not
unobservant
of
the
revolutions
occurring
in
asia
upon
which
he
maintained
a
constant
watch
and
in
the
years
which
followed
the
capitulation
of
tyre
he
found
the
opportunity
so
long
looked
for
of
entering
once
more
upon
the
scene
the
phoenician
navy
had
suffered
much
during
the
lengthy
blockade
of
their
country
and
had
become
inferior
to
the
egyptian
now
well
organised
by
thelonians
apries
therefore
took
the
offensive
by
sea
and
made
a
direct
descent
on
the
phoenician
coasts
nebuchadrezzar
opposed
him
with
the
forces
of
the
recently
subjugated
tyrians
and
the
latter
having
cooled
in
their
attachment
to
egypt
owing
to
the
special
favour
shown
by
the
pharaoh
to
their
rivals
the
hellenes
summoned
their
cypriote
vassals
to
assist
them
in
repelling
the
attack
the
egyptians
dispersed
the
combined
fleets
and
taking
possession
of
sidon
gave
it
up
to
pillage
the
other
maritime
cities
surrendered
of
their
own
accord
including
gebal
which
received
an
egyptian
garrison
and
where
the
officers
of
pharaoh
founded
a
temple
to
the
goddess
whom
they
identified
with
the
egyptian
hâthor
the
war
of
apries
against
the
phoenicians
can
not
have
taken
place
before
the
capitulation
of
tyre
in
because
the
tyrians
took
part
in
it
by
order
of
nebuchadrezzar
and
on
the
other
hand
it
can
not
be
put
later
than
the
date
of
the
revolt
of
amasis
it
must
therefore
be
assigned
to
about
the
object
at
which
necho
and
psammetichus
ii
had
aimed
for
fifteen
years
was
thus
attained
by
apries
at
one
fortunate
blow
and
he
could
legitimately
entitle
himself
fortunate
than
all
the
kings
his
predecessors
and
imagine
in
his
pride
that
gods
themselves
were
unable
to
injure
the
gods
however
did
not
allow
him
long
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
his
victory
greeks
had
often
visited
libya
since
the
time
when
egypt
had
been
thrown
open
to
the
trade
of
the
iegean
their
sailors
had
discovered
that
the
most
convenient
course
thither
was
to
sail
straight
to
crete
and
then
to
traverse
the
sea
between
this
island
and
the
headlands
of
the
libyan
plateau
here
they
fell
in
with
a
strong
current
setting
towards
the
east
which
carried
them
quickly
and
easily
as
far
as
eakotis
and
canopus
along
the
marmarican
shore
in
these
voyages
they
learned
to
appreciate
the
value
of
the
country
and

had
set

in
the
small

they
built
a
strongly
fortified
settlement
their
leader

crossed
over
to
the
mainland

having
reached
the
high
plateau
he
built
the
city
of
cyrene
on
the
borders
of
an
extremely
fertile
region

abundant
springs
the

of
the
labu

had
fought
so
valiantly
against
the
pharaohs

a

of
loose
confederation

their
territory
stretched
across
the
deserts
from
the
egyptian
frontier
to
the
shores
of
the
syrtes

of
this

herodotus
seems
to
have
been
ignorant
of
the
real
name
of
the
founder

has
been
preserved

us
by
pindar

in
the
language

libya
the
description
given
by
herodotus
of
these
libyan
tribes
agrees
with
the
slight
amount
of
information
furnished
by
the
egyptian
monuments
for
the
thirteenth
century
the
most
civilised
of
these
tribes
were
those
which
now
dwelt

were

dwelt

to
employ

recruited
from

of
confidence
in

of
disdain
for

delighted

at
an
opportunity
for
at

convincing
their

of
their
error
in
preferring

brought
to

all
their

the

in

of

near
the
spot
where
the
high

proper
terminate
in

severely
during
the
subsequent
retreat
that
only
a
small
remnant
of
the
army
regained
in
safety
the
frontier
of
the
delta
the
interpretation
i
have
given
to
the
sentiments
of
the
egyptian
army
follows
clearly
enough
from
the
observation
of
herodotus
that
egyptians
having
never
experienced
themselves
the
power
of
the
greeks
had
felt
for
them
nothing
but
the
site
of
irasa
and
the
fountain
of

has
been
fixed
with
much
probability
in
the
fertile
district
watered
still
by
the
fountain
of
ersen
erazem
or
erasân
this
unexpected
reverse
was
the
occasion
of
the
outbreak
of
a
revolution
which
had
been
in
preparation
for
years
the
emigration
to
ethiopia
of
some
contingents
of
the
military
class
had
temporarily
weakened
the
factions
hostile
to
foreign
influence
these
factions
had
felt
themselves
powerless
under
the
rule
of
psammetichus
and
had
bowed
to
his
will
prepared
all
the
while
to
reassert
themselves
when
they
felt
strong
enough
to
do
so
successfully
the
reorganisation
of
the
native
army
furnished
them
at
once
with
the
means
of
insurrection
of
which
they
had
temporarily
been
deprived
although
pharaoh
had
lavished
privileges
on
the
hermotybies
and
calasiries
she
had
not
removed
the
causes
for
discontent
which
had
little
by
little
alienated
the
good
will
of
the
mashauasha
to
do
so
would
have
rendered
necessary
the
disbanding
of
the
ionian
guard
the
object
of
their
jealousy
and
to
take
this
step
neither
he
nor
his
successors
could
submit
themselves
the
hatred
of
these
mercenaries
and
the
irritation
against
the
sovereigns
who
employed
them
grew
fiercer
from
reign
to
reign
and
now
wanted
nothing
but
a
pretext
to
break
forth
openly
such
a
pretext
was
furnished
by
the
defeat
at
irasa
when
the
fugitives
arrived
at
the
entrenched
camp
of
marea
exasperated
by
their
defeat
and
alleging
doubtless
that
it
was
due
to
treachery
they
found
others
who
affected
to
share
their
belief
that
pharaoh
had
despatched
his
egyptian
troops
against
cyrene
with
the
view
of
consigning
to
certain
death
those
whose
loyalty
to
him
was
suspected
and
it
was
not
difficult
to
stir
up
the
disaffected
soldiers
to
open
revolt
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
a
military
tumult
had
threatened
the
sovereignty
of
apries
some
time
previous
to
this
in
an
opposite
quarter
of
the
nile
valley
the
troops
stationed
at
elephantine
composed
partly
of
egyptians
partly
of
asiatic
and
greek
mercenaries
possibly
the
same
who
had
fought
in
the
ethiopian
campaign
under
psammetichus
had
risen
in
rebellion
owing
to
some
neglect
in
the
payment
of
their
wages
having
devastated
the
thebaid
they
had
marched
straight
across
the
desert
to
the
port
of
shashirît
in
the
hope
of
there
seizing
ships
to
enable
them
to
reach
the
havens
of
idumæa
or
nabatoa
the
governor
of
elephantine
nsihor
had
at
first
held
them
back
with
specious
promises
but
on
learning
that
apries
was
approaching
with
reinforcements
he
attacked
them
boldly
and
driving
them
before
him
hemmed
them
in
between
his
own
force
and
that
of
the
king
and
massacred
them
all
apries
thought
that
the
revolt
at
marea
would
have
a
similar
issue
and
that
he
might
succeed
in
baffling
the
rebels
by
fair
words
he
sent
to
them
as
his
representative
amasis
one
of
his
generals
distantly
connected
probably
with
the
royal
house
what
took
place
in
the
camp
is
not
clearly
known
for
the
actual
events
have
been
transformed
in
the
course
of
popular
transmission
into
romantic
legends
the
story
soon
took
shape
that
amasis
was
born
of
humble
parentage
in
the
village
of
siuph
not
far
from
sais
he
was
fond
it
was
narrated
of
wine
the
pleasures
of
the
table
and
women
and
replenished
his
empty
purse
by
stealing
what
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
from
his
neighbours
or
comrades
a
gay
all
the
while
with
an
easy
disposition
and
sarcastic
tongue
according
to
some
accounts
he
conciliated
the
favour
of
apries
by
his
invariable
affability
and
good
humour
according
to
others
he
won
the
confidence
by
presenting
him
with
a
crown
of
flowers
on
his
birthday
the
king
to
whom
amasis
made
this
offering
is
called
patarmis
and
the
similarity
of
this
name
with
the
patarbemis
of
herodotus
seems
to
indicate
a
variant
of
the
legend
in
which
patarmis
or
patarbemis
took
the
place
of
apries
the
story
goes
on
to
say
that
while
he
was
haranguing
the
rebels
one
of
them
slipping
behind
him
suddenly
placed
on
his
head
the
rounded
helmet
of
the
pharaohs
the
bystanders
immediately
proclaimed
him
king
and
after
a
slight
show
of
resistance
he
accepted
the
dignity
as
soon
as
the
rumour
of
these
events
had
reached
sais
apries
despatched
patarbemis
one
of
his
chief
officers
with
orders
to
bring
back
the
rebel
chief
alive
the
latter
was
seated
on
his
horse
on
the
point
of
breaking
up
his
camp
and
marching
against
his
former
patron
when
the
envoy
arrived
on
learning
the
nature
of
his
mission
amasis
charged
him
to
carry
back
a
reply
to
the
effect
that
he
had
already
been
making
preparation
to
submit
and
besought
the
sovereign
to
grant
him
patiently
a
few
days
longer
so
that
he
might
bring
with
him
the
egyptian
subjects
of
pharaoh
tradition
adds
that
on
receiving
this
insolent
defiance
apries
fell
into
a
violent
passion
and
without
listening
to
remonstrance
ordered
the
nose
and
ears
of
patarbemis
to
be
cut
off
whereupon
the
indignant
people
it
is
alleged
deserted
his
cause
and
ranged
themselves
on
the
side
of
amasis
the
mercenaries
however
did
not
betray
the
confidence
reposed
in
them
by
their
egyptian
lords
although
only
thirty
thousand
against
a
whole
people
they
unflinchingly
awaited
the
attack
at
momemphis
but
being
overwhelmed
by
the
numbers
of
their
assailants
disbanded
and
fled
after
a
conflict
lasting
one
day
apries
taken
prisoner
in
the
rout
was
at
first
well
treated
by
the
conqueror
and
seems
even
to
have
retained
for
a
time
the
external
pomp
of
royalty
but
the
populace
of
sais
demanding
his
execution
with
vehemence
amasis
was
at
length
constrained
to
deliver
him
up
to
their
vengeance
and
apries
was
strangled
by
the
mob
he
was
honourably
interred
between
the
royal
palace
and
the
temple
of
nit
not
far
from
the
spot
where
his
predecessors
reposed
in
their
glory
and
the
usurper
made
himself
sole
master
of
the
country
it
was
equivalent
to
a
change
of
dynasty
and
amasis
had
recourse
to
the
methods
usual
in
such
cases
to
consolidate
his
power
he
entered
into
a
marriage
alliance
with
princesses
of
the
saite
line
and
thus
legitimatised
his
usurpation
as
far
as
the
north
was
concerned
it
was
probably
from
this
necropolis
that
the
coffin
of
psammetichus
ii
came
the
wife
of
amasis
who
was
mother
of
psammetichus
the
queen
tintkhiti
daughter
of
petenit
prophet
of
phtah
was
probably
connected
with
the
royal
family
of
sais
in
the
south
the
had
continued
to
administer
the
extensive
heritage
of
amon
and
nitocris
heiress
of
shapenuapît
had
adopted
in
her
old
age
a
daughter
of
her
psammetichus
il
named
ankhnasnofiribrî
this
princess
was
at
this
time
in
possession
of
thebes
and
amasis
appears
to
have
entered
into
a
fictitious
marriage
with
her
in
order
to
assume
to
himself
her
rights
to
the
crown
he
had
hardly
succeeded
in
establishing
his
authority
on
a
firm
basis
when
he
was
called
upon
to
repel
the
chaldaean
invasion
the
hebrew
prophets
had
been
threatening
egypt
with
this
invasion
for
a
long
time
and
ezekiel
discounting
the
future
had
already
described
the
entrance
of
pharaoh
into
hades
to
dwell
among
the
chiefs
of
the
nations
assur
elam
meshech
tubal
edom
and
philistia
who
having
incurred
the
vengeance
of
jahveh
had
descended
into
the
grave
one
after
the
other
and
all
his
army
shall
be
slain
by
the
sword
saith
the
lord
god
for
i
have
put
this
terror
in
the
land
of
the
living
and
he
shall
be
laid
in
the
midst
of
the
uncircumcised
with
them
that
are
slain
by
the
sword
even
pharaoh
and
all
his
multitude
saith
the
lord
god
nebuchadrezzar
had
some
hesitation
in
hazarding
his
fortune
in
a
campaign
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
he
realised
tolerably
clearly
that
babylon
was
not
in
command
of
such
resources
as
had
been
at
the
disposal
of
nineveh
under
esarhaddon
or
and
that
egypt
in
the
hands
of
a
saite
dynasty
was
a
more
formidable
foe
than
when
ruled
by
the
ethiopians
the
report
of
the
revolution
of
which
apries
had
become
a
victim
at
length
determined
him
to
act
the
annihilation
of
the
hellenic
troops
and
the
dismay
which
the
defeat
at
irasa
had
occasioned
in
the
hearts
of
the
egyptians
seemed
to
offer
an
opportunity
too
favourable
to
be
neglected
the
campaign
was
opened
by
nebuchadrezzar
about
in
the
year
of
his
reign
but
we
have
no
certain
information
as
to
the
issue
of
his
enterprise
a
fragment
of
his
annals
discovered
by
pinches
mentions
in
the
year
of
his
reign
a
campaign
against
ah
masu
king
of
egypt
and
wiedemann
from
the
evidence
of
this
document
combined
with
the
information
derived
from
one
of
the
monuments
in
the
louvre
thought
that
the
fact
of
a
conquest
of
egypt
as
far
as
syenô
might
be
admitted
at
that
point
the
egyptian
general
nsihor
would
have
defeated
the
chaldæans
and
repelled
the
invasion
and
this
event
would
have
taken
place
during
the
joint
reign
of
apries
and
amasis
a
more
attentive
examination
of
the
egyptian
monument
shows
that
it
refers
not
to
a
chaldæan
war
but
to
a
rebellion
of
the
garrisons
in
the
south
of
egypt
including
the
greek
and
semitic
auxiliaries
according
to
chaldæan
tradition
nebuchadrezzar
actually
invaded
the
valley
of
the
nile
and
converted
egypt
into
a
babylonian
province
with
amasis
as
its
satrap
we
may
well
believe
that
amasis
lost
the
conquests
won
by
his
predecessor
in
phoenicia
if
indeed
they
still
belonged
to
egypt
at
his
accession
but
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
chaldæans
ever
entered
egypt
itself
and
repeated
the
assyrian
exploit
of
a
century
before
these
events
would
have
taken
place
in
the
year
of
nebuchadrezzar
the
reigning
king
apries
being
killed
and
his
place
taken
by
one
of
his
generals
amasis
who
remained
a
satrap
of
the
babylonian
empire
this
was
last
war
the
last
at
least
of
which
history
makes
any
mention
as
a
fact
the
kings
of
the
second
babylonian
empire
do
not
seem
to
have
been
the
impetuous
conquerors
which
we
have
fancied
them
to
be
we
see
them
as
they
are
depicted
to
us
in
the
visions
of
the
hebrew
prophets
who
regarding
them
and
their
nation
as
a
scourge
in
the
hands
of
god
had
no
colours
vivid
enough
or
images
sufficiently
terrible
to
portray
them
they
had
blotted
out
nineveh
from
the
list
of
cities
humiliated
pharaoh
and
subjugated
syria
and
they
had
done
all
this
almost
at
their
first
appearance
in
the
field
such
a
feat
as
assyria
and
egypt
in
the
plenitude
of
their
strength
had
been
unable
to
accomplish
they
had
moreover
destroyed
jerusalem
and
carried
judah
into
captivity
there
is
nothing
astonishing
in
the
fact
that
this
nebuchadrezzar
whose
history
is
known
to
us
almost
entirely
from
jewish
sources
should
appear
as
a
fated
force
let
loose
upon
the
world
thou
sword
of
the
lord
how
long
will
it
be
ere
thou
be
quiet
put
up
thyself
into
the
scabbard
rest
and
be
still
how
canst
thou
be
quiet
seeing
the
lord
hath
given
thee
a
charge
but
his
campaigns
in
syria
and
africa
of
which
the
echoes
transmitted
to
us
still
seem
so
formidable
were
not
nearly
so
terrible
in
reality
as
those
in
which
blam
had
perished
a
century
previously
they
were
moreover
the
only
conflicts
which
troubled
the
peace
of
his
reign
the
arabian
chroniclers
affirm
indeed
that
the
fabulous
wealth
of
yemen
had
incited
him
to
invade
that
region
nebuchadrezzar
they
relate
routed
not
far
from
the
town
of
the
joctanides
of
jorhom
who
had
barred
his
road
to
the
kaabah
and
after
seizing
mecca
reached
the
borders
of
the
children
of
himyrâ
the
exhausted
condition
of
his
soldiers
having
prevented
him
from
pressing
further
forward
in
his
career
of
conquest
he
retraced
his
steps
and
returned
to
babylon
with
a
great
number
of
prisoners
including
two
entire
tribes
those
of
hadhurâ
and
uabar
whom
he
established
as
colonists
in
chaldæa
he
never
passed
in
this
direction
beyond
the
limits
reached
by
and
his
exploits
were
restricted
to
some
successful
raids
against
the
tribes
of
kedar
and
nabatsea
most
of
the
arabic
legends
relating
to
these
conquests
of
nebuchadrezzar
are
indirectly
derived
from
the
biblical
story
but
it
is
possible
that
the
history
of
the
expeditions
against
central
arabia
is
founded
on
fact
this
seems
to
follow
from
imprecations
upon
kedar
the
same
reasons
which
at
the
commencement
of
his
reign
had
restrained
his
ambition
to
extend
his
dominions
towards
the
east
and
north
were
operative
up
to
the
end
of
his
life
astyages
had
not
inherited
the
martial
spirit
of
his
father
cyaxares
and
only
one
warlike
expedition
that
against
the
cadusians
is
ascribed
to
him
moses
of
chorene
attributes
to
him
long
wars
against
an
armenian
king
named
tigranes
but
this
is
a
fiction
of
a
later
age
naturally
indolent
lacking
in
decision
superstitious
and
cruel
he
passed
a
life
of
idleness
amid
the
luxury
of
a
corrupt
court
surrounded
by
pages
women
and
eunuchs
with
no
more
serious
pastime
than
the
chase
pursued
within
the
limits
of
his
own
parks
or
on
the
confines
of
the
desert
but
if
the
king
was
weak
his
empire
was
vigorous
and
nebuchadrezzar
brought
up
from
his
youth
to
dread
the
armies
of
media
retained
his
respect
for
them
up
to
the
end
of
his
life
even
when
there
was
no
longer
any
occasion
to
do
so
nebuchadrezzar
was
after
all
not
so
much
a
warrior
as
a
man
of
peace
whether
so
constituted
by
nature
or
rendered
so
by
political
necessity
in
its
proper
sense
and
he
took
advantage
of
the
long
intervals
of
quiet
between
his
campaigns
to
complete
the
extensive
works
which
more
than
anything
else
have
won
for
him
his
renown
during
the
century
which
had
preceded
the
fall
of
nineveh
babylonia
had
had
several
bitter
experiences
it
had
suffered
almost
entire
destruction
at
the
hands
of
sennacherib
it
had
been
given
up
to
pillage
by
not
to
mention
the
sieges
and
ravages
it
had
sustained
in
the
course
of
continual
revolts
the
other
cities
of
babylonia
sippara
borsippa
kutha
nipur
uruk
and
uru
had
been
subjected
to
capture
and
recapture
while
the
surrounding
districts
abandoned
in
turn
to
elamites
assyrians
and
the
kaldâ
had
lain
uncultivated
for
many
years
the
canals
at
the
same
time
had
become
choked
with
mud
the
banks
had
fallen
in
and
the
waters
no
longer
kept
under
control
had
overflowed
the
land
and
the
plains
long
since
reclaimed
for
cultivation
had
returned
to
their
original
condition
of
morasses
and
at
babylon
itself
the
arakhtu
still
encumbered
with
the
cast
into
it
by
sennacherib
was
no
longer
navigable
and
was
productive
of
more
injury
than
profit
to
the
city
in
some
parts
the
aspect
of
the
country
must
have
been
desolate
and
neglected
as
at
the
present
day
and
the
work
accomplished
by
twenty
generations
had
to
be
begun
entirely
afresh
nabopolassar
had
already
applied
himself
to
the
task
in
spite
of
the
anxieties
of
his
assyrian
campaigns
and
had
raised
many
earthworks
in
both
the
capital
and
the
provinces
but
a
great
deal
more
still
remained
to
be
done
and
nebuchadrezzar
pushed
forward
the
work
planned
by
his
father
and
carried
it
to
completion
undeterred
and
undismayed
by
any
difficulties
the
combined
system
of
irrigation
and
navigation
introduced
by
the
kings
of
the
first
babylonian
empire
twenty
centuries
previously
was
ingeniously
repaired
the
beds
of
the
principal
canals
the
royal
river
and
the
arakhtu
were
straightened
and
deepened
the
drainage
of
the
country
between
the
tigris
and
the
euphrates
was
regulated
by
means
of
subsidiary
canals
and
a
network
of
dykes
the
canals
surrounding
babylon
or
intersecting
in
the
middle
of
the
city
were
cleaned
out
and
a
waterway
was
secured
for
navigation
from
one
river
to
the
other
and
from
the
plateau
of
mesopotamia
to
the
the
only
long
inscriptions
of
nebuchadrezzar
which
we
possess
are
those
commemorating
the
great
works
he
designed
and
executed
the
irrigation
works
of
nebuchadrezzar
are
described
at
length
and
perhaps
exaggerated
by
abydenus
who
merely
quotes
berosus
more
or
less
inaccurately
the
completion
of
the
quays
along
the
arakhtu
begun
by
nabopolassar
is
noticed
in
the
india
a
special
inscription
publ
by
rawlinson
gives
an
account
of
the
repairing
of
the
canal
which
crossed
babylon
we
may
well
believe
that
all
undertakings
were
carried
out
in
accordance
with
a
carefully
prepared
scheme
for
perfecting
the
defences
of
the
kingdom
while
completing
the
system
of
internal
communication
the
riches
of
karduniash
now
restored
to
vigour
by
continued
peace
and
become
the
centre
of
a
considerable
empire
could
not
fail
to
excite
the
jealousy
of
its
neighbours
and
particularly
that
of
the
most
powerful
among
them
the
medes
of
ecbatana
it
is
true
that
the
relations
between
nebuchadrezzar
and
astyages
continued
to
be
cordial
and
as
yet
there
were
no
indications
of
a
rupture
but
it
was
always
possible
that
under
their
successors
the
good
understanding
between
the
two
courts
might
come
to
an
end
and
it
was
needful
to
provide
against
the
possibility
of
the
barbarous
tribes
of
iran
being
let
loose
upon
babylon
and
attempting
to
inflict
on
her
the
fate
they
had
brought
upon
nineveh
nebuchadrezzar
therefore
was
anxious
to
interpose
between
himself
and
these
possible
foes
such
a
series
of
fortifications

the
most
persevering
enemy
would
be
worn
out

the
prolonged
task

forcing
them

after
another

that
they
were

but
the
whole
of

work
of

must
not
be
attributed
to
nebuchadrezzar
alone
the
plans
had
been
designed
by
nabopolassar
under
the
influence
of
one
of
his
wives
who
by
a
strange
chance
bears
in
classic
tradition
the
very
egyptian
name
of
nitocris
but
his
work
was
insignificant
compared
with
that
accomplished
by
his
son
and
the
name
of
nebuchadrezzar
was
justly
connected
with
the
marvels
of
babylon
by
all
ancient
writers
but
even
his
reign
of
years
did
not
suffice
for
the
completion
of
all
his
undertakings
and
many
details
still
remained
imperfect
at
his
death
in
the
beginning
of
though
of
kaldu
origin
and
consequently
exposed
to
the
suspicions
and
secret
enmity
of
the
native
babylonians
as
all
of
his
race
even
himself
had
been
before
him
he
had
yet
succeeded
throughout
the
whole
of
his
reign
in
making
himself
respected
by
the
turbulent
inhabitants
of
his
capital
and
in
curbing
the
ambitious
pretensions
of
the
priests
of
merodach
as
soon
as
his
was
withdrawn
the
passions
so
long
repressed
broke
forth
and
proved
utterly
beyond
the
control
of
his
less
able
or
less
fortunate
successors
the
sequel
of
this
history
is
known
from
the
narrative
of
berosus
its
authenticity
is
proved
by
passages
on
the
of
considers
that
marduk
and
were
overthrown
by
the
priestly
faction
but
a
passage
on
the
in
which
nabonidus
represents
himself
as
inheriting
the
political
views
of
nebuchadrezzar
and
leads
me
to
take
the
opposite
view
we
know
what
hatred
nabonidus
roused
in
the
minds
of
the
priests
of
merodach
because
his
principles
of
government
were
opposed
to
theirs
the
severe
judgment
he
passed
on
the
rule
of
and
seems
to
prove
that
he
considered
them
as
belonging
to
the
rival
party
in
the
state
that
is
to
the
priestly
faction
the
forms
of
the
names
and
the
lengths
of
the
several
reigns
have
been
confirmed
by
contemporary
monuments
especially
by
the
numerous
contract

principal
inscriptions

to
the
reign

furnished
by

scheil
as
far
as
we
are
able
to
judge
by
the
documents
which
have
come
down
to
us
two
factions
had
arisen
in
the
city
since
the
fall
of
nineveh
both
of
which
aspired
to
power
and
strove
to
gain
a
controlling
influence
with
the
sovereign
the
one
comprised
the
descendants
of
the
kaldâ
who
had
delivered
the
city
from
the
assyrian
yoke
together
with
those
of
the
ancient
military
nobility
the
other
was
composed
of
the
great
priestly
families
and
their
adherents
who
claimed
for
the
gods
or
their
representatives
the
right
to
control
the
affairs
of
the
state
and
to
impose
the
will
of
heaven
on
the
rulers
of
the
kingdom
the
latter
faction
seems
to
have
prevailed
at
first
at
the
court
of
the
sole
surviving
son
and
successor
of
nebuchadrezzar
this
prince
on
his
accession
embraced
a
policy
contrary
to
that
pursued
by
his
father
and
one
of
his
first
acts
was
to
release
jehoiachin
king
of
judah
who
had
been
languishing
in
chains
for
years
and
to
ameliorate
the
condition
of
the
other
expatriated
jews
the
official
history
of
a
later
date
represented
him
as
having
been
an
unjust
sovereign
but
we
have
no
information
as
to
his
misdeeds
and
know
only
that
after
two
years
a
conspiracy
broke
out
against
him
led
by
his
own
who
assassinated
him
and
seized
the
vacant
throne
endeavoured
to
revive
the
policy
of
nebuchadrezzar
and
was
probably
supported
by
the
military
party
but
his
reign
was
a
short
one
he
died
in
leaving
as
sole
heir
a
youth
of
dissipated
character
named
whose
name
is
stigmatised
by
the
chroniclers
as
that
of
a
prince
who
knew
not
how
to
rule
he
was
murdered
at
the
end
of
nine
months
and
his
place
taken
by
a
native
babylonian
a
certain
nabonâîd
nabonidus
son
of
who
was
not
connected
by
birth
with
his
immediate
predecessors
on
the
throne
no
oriental
empire
could
escape
from
the
effects
of
frequent
and
abrupt
changes
in
its
rulers
like
so
many
previous
dynasties
that
of
nabopolassar
became
enfeebled
as
if
from
exhaustion
immediately
after
the
death
of
its
most
illustrious
scion
and
foundered
in
imbecility
and
decrepitude
popular
imagination
by
such
a
sudden
downfall
from
exalted
prosperity
recognised
the
hand
of
god
in
the
events
which
brought
about
the
catastrophe
a
chaldæan
legend
current
not
long
after
related
how
nebuchadrezzar
being
seized
towards
the
end
of
his
life
with
the
spirit
of
prophecy
mounted
to
the
roof
of
his
palace
and
was
constrained
as
a
punishment
for
his
pride
to
predict
to
his
people
with
his
own
lips
the
approaching
ruin
of
their
city
thereupon
the
glory
of
its
monarch
suffered
an
eclipse
from
which
there
was
no
emerging
the
jews
nourishing
undying
hatred
for
conqueror
who
had
overthrown
jerusalem
and
destroyed
the
temple
of
solomon
were
not
satisfied
with
a
punishment
so
inadequate
according
to
them
nebuchadrezzar
after
his
victorious
career
was
so
intoxicated
with
his
own
glory
that
he
proclaimed
himself
the
equal
of
god
not
this
great
babylon
he
cried
i
have
built
for
the
royal
by
the
might
of
my
power
and
for
the
glory
of
my
majesty
and
while
he
thus
spake
there
came
a
voice
from
heaven
decreeing
his
metamorphosis
into
the
form
of
a
beast
was
driven
from
men
and
did
eat
grass
as
oxen
and
his
body
was
wet
with
the
dew
of
heaven
till
his
hair
was
grown
like
feathers
and
his
nails
like
for
seven
years
the
king
remained
in
this
state
to
resume
his
former
shape
at
the
end
of
this
period
and
recover
his
kingdom

having
magnified
the
god
of
israel
dan
iv
the
founder
of
the
dynasty
which
replaced
that
of
nebuchadrezzar
nabonidus
was
certainly
ill
fitted
to
brave
the
storms
already
threatening
to
break
over
his
kingdom
it
has
not
been
ascertained
whether
he
had
any
natural
right
to
the
throne
or
by
what
means
he
attained
supreme
power
but
the
way
in
which
he
dwells
on
the
names
of
nebuchadrezzar
and
renders
it
probable
that
he
was
raised
to
the
throne
by
the
military
faction
he
did
not
prove
as
events
turned
turned
out
a
good
general
nor
even
a
soldier
of
moderate
ability
and
it
is
even
possible
that
he
also
lacked
that
fierce
courage
of
which
none
of
his
predecessors
was
ever
destitute
he
allowed
his
army
to
dwindle
away
and
his
fortresses
to
fall
into
ruins
the
foreign
alliances
existing
at
his
accession
together
with
those
which
he
himself
had
concluded
were
not
turned
to
the
best
advantage
his
provinces
were
badly
administered
and
his
subjects
rendered
discontented
his
most
salient
characteristic
was
an
insatiable
curiosity
concerning
historical
and
religious
antiquities
which
stimulated
him
to
undertake
excavations
in
all
the
temples
in
order
to
bring
to
light
monuments
of
ages
long
gone

measure

success
