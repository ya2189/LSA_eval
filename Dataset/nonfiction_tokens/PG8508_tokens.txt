introduction
let
it
be
understood
at
the
outset
that
every
proved
theory
of
science
is
to
be
accepted
only
the
most
intense
prejudice
and
the
maddest
folly
would
lead
any
one
to
reject
the
proved
conclusions
of
science
moreover
we
should
examine
any
new
hypothesis
with
open
minds
to
see
if
it
has
in
it
anything
truthful
helpful
or
advantageous
it
should
neither
be
accepted
nor
rejected
simply
because
it
is
new
but
if
a
theory
is
evidently
or
probably
untrue
or
pernicious
or
at
all
harmful
it
is
to
be
rejected
and
condemned
some
facts
and
objections
are
herein
submitted
to
the
serious
seeker
after
truth
in
the
hope
that
a
theory
so
out
of
harmony
with
the
facts
and
so
destructive
to
the
faith
and
the
cherished
hopes
of
man
may
be
completely
discarded
as
evolution
can
not
stand
the
acid
test
of
mathematics
it
will
be
repudiated
by
all
we
shall
discuss
the
theory
upon
its
merits
from
a
scientific
standpoint
and
will
also
demand
an
explanation
of
all
facts
concerned
as
we
have
a
right
to
do
even
where
they
are
associated
with
the
theological
and
the
spiritual
as
well
as
the
material
we
do
not
oppose
true
science
but
falsely
so
we
do
not
ban
research
but
will
not
allow
the
wild
vagaries
of
the
imagination
to
pass
as
truth
we
shall
not
declare
arbitrarily
that
evolution
is
untrue
neither
will
we
allow
scientists
to
decide
what
we
shall
believe
but
we
shall
appeal
to
the
facts
and
evolution
must
stand
or
fall
by
the
evidence
is
not
to
be
accepted
until
it
is
not
yet
proved
and
never
will
be
mathematics
the
acid
test
every
theory
to
which
mathematics
can
be
applied
will
be
proved
or
disproved
by
this
acid
test
figures
will
not
lie
and
mathematics
will
not
lie
even
at
the
demand
of
liars
their
testimony
is
as
clear
as
the
mind
of
god
gravitation
is
proved
a
true
theory
by
numerous
calculations
some
of
them
the
most
abstruse
the
copernican
theory
is
proved
true
and
the
ptolemaic
theory
false
by
mathematical
calculations
the
calculations
leading
to
the
discovery
of
neptune
went
far
to
establish
the
copernican
theory
as
well
as
the
law
of
gravitation
and
to
disprove
the
ptolemaic
theory
the
evolution
theory
especially
as
applied
to
man
likewise
is
disproved
by
mathematics
the
proof
is
overwhelming
and
decisive
thus
god
makes
the
noble
science
of
mathematics
bear
testimony
in
favor
of
the
true
theories
and
against
the
false
theories
we
shall
endeavor
to
marshal
some
of
the
mathematical
proofs
against
the
false
and
pernicious
theory
of
evolution
true
theories
such
as
the
gravitation
and
copernican
theories
harmonize
with
each
other
as
every
branch
of
mathematics
harmonizes
with
every
other
if
evolution
were
true
it
would
harmonize
with
all
other
true
theories
rather
than
with
so
many
false
theories
theories
of
evolution
evolution
in
one
sense
means
growth
or
development
unrolling
or
unfolding
it
is
difficult
to
give
a
clear
definition
that
will
apply
to
each
of
the
various
theories
that
are
held
theories
differ
vastly
in
the
extent
of
their
application
as
held
by
their
various
advocates
resulting
in
great
confusion
of
terms
the
atheists
believe
that
there
is
no
god
hence
matter
was
not
created
but
was
eternal
or
came
by
chance
only
a
mere
handful
of
the
whole
human
race
have
ever
yet
believed
such
an
untenable
doctrine
the
existence
of
a
creator
is
doubted
or
denied
by
extreme
atheistic
evolutionists
who
would
dethrone
god
the
monkey
and
degrade
the
first
of
modern
scientific
men
to
adopt
the
theory
that
all
plants
and
animals
including
man
are
developed
from
certain
original
simple
germs
was
lamarck
a
french
naturalist
in
he
conceded
that
god
created
matter
more
he
believed
in
spontaneous
generation
which
scientific
investigation
has
utterly
disproved
darwin
goes
a
step
further
and
concedes
there
may
have
been
a
creator
of
matter
and
of
one
or
at
most
a
few
germs
from
which
all
vegetation
and
all
animals
came
by
evolution
orders
classes
families
genera
species
and
varieties
he
differs
from
lamarck
by
allowing
the
creation
of
one
germ
possibly
a
few
more
he
says
in
his
of
species
believe
that
animals
are
descended
from
at
most
only
four
or
five
progenitors
and
plants
from
an
equal
or
lesser
number
analogy
would
lead
me
one
step
further
namely
to
the
belief
that
all
animals
and
plants
are
descended
from
one
prototype
all
the
organic
beings
which
have
ever
lived
on
the
earth
may
be
descended
from
some
primordial
darwin
because
of
his
great
scholarship
fairness
and
candor
won
for
his
theory
more
favor
than
it
inherently
deserves
darwin
taught
that
lower
impulses
of
vegetable
life
pass
by
insensible
gradations
into
the
instinct
of
animals
and
the
higher
intelligence
of
man
without
purpose
or
design
none
of
these
three
hypotheses
can
admit
the
creation
of
man
other
evolutionists
believing
in
the
evolution
of
both
plants
and
animals
nevertheless
refuse
to
believe
in
the
evolution
of
most
baneful
application
of
the
whole
theory
even
if
there
were
convincing
proof
of
the
evolution
of
plants
and
animals
from
one
germ
there
is
no
real
proof
of
the
evolution
of
man
to
prove
this
is
the
chief
purpose
of
this
book
a
fifth
theory
of
evolution
is
held
by
many
it
is
called
polyphyletic
evolution
which
means
that
god
created
numerous
stocks
or
beginnings
of
both
plant
and
animal
life
which
were
subject
to
change
and
growth
deterioration
and
development
according
to
his
plan
and
purpose
so
much
of
evolution
in
this
sense
as
can
be
proved
is
in
harmony
with
the
bible
account
of
the
creation
of
plants
animals
and
man
the
false
theory
of
evolution
is
called
the
monophyletic
which
teaches
that
all
species
of
plants
and
animals
including
man
developed
from
one
cell
or
germ
which
came
by
creation
or
spontaneous
generation
evolution
is
used
throughout
this
book
in
this
latter
sense
unless
otherwise
indicated
by
the
context
god
does
not
create
by
evolution
for
it
can
only
develop
what
already
exists
this
book
is
divided
into
three
parts
in
part
one
material
evolution
especially
the
evolution
of
the
human
body
is
disproved
in
part
two
the
alleged
proofs
of
evolution
are
examined
and
refuted
in
part
three
the
evolution
of
the
soul
is
shown
to
be
impossible
there
are
in
all
fifty
numbered
arguments
including
answers
to
the
arguments
of
evolutionists
part
one
the
evolution
of
the
human
body
mathematically
disproved
any
scientific
theory
or
hypothesis
must
be
proved
first
possible
then
probable
then
certain
to
be
a
possible
theory
it
must
be
reconcilable
with
many
facts
to
be
a
probable
theory
it
must
be
reconcilable
with
many
more
to
be
a
certain
and
proven
theory
it
must
be
reconcilable
with
the
facts
whenever
it
is
irreconcilable
with
fact
it
should
be
rejected
as
it
can
not
be
a
true
theory
every
true
theory
passes
through
these
three
stages
probability
and
certainty
a
theory
is
not
science
until
it
is
certainly
true
and
so
becomes
knowledge
the
evolution
of
man
from
the
brute
is
in
the
throes
of
a
desperate
struggle
to
show
that
it
may
possibly
be
a
true
theory
or
hypothesis
yet
some
who
are
ready
to
admit
that
they
are
claim
evolution
a
proven
theory
if
it
can
be
shown
possible
for
man
to
have
descended
or
ascended
from
the
lower
animals
it
will
require
enormous
additional
evidence
to
show
that
such
descent
is
probable
and
still
much
more
to
make
it
certain
every
scientific
theory
proposed
as
is
reconcilable
with
some
facts
otherwise
it
would
not
have
been
considered
for
a
moment
many
false
hypotheses
have
been
proposed
and
accepted
as
possible
and
even
probable
because
reconcilable
with
some
facts
the
ptolemaic
theory
of
the
universe
making
the
earth
the
centre
around
which
the
heavens
revolved
in
great
concentric
spheres
was
accepted
for
years
from
because
it
explained
many
things
it
corresponded
with
appearances
it
appealed
to
all
its
advocates
had
great
difficulty
in
reconciling
it
with
the
motions
of
the
planets
which
were
therefore
called
planets
or
but
in
time
the
copernican
theory
prevailed
because
it
was
reconcilable
with
all
the
facts
the
evidence
is
so
abundant
that
all
claim
it
the
true
theory
it
is
science
it
is
knowledge
because
the
copernican
hypothesis
the
true
theory
of
the
universe
was
opposed
and
rejected
it
does
not
follow
that
the
evolution
of
man
is
true
because
it
is
likewise
opposed
and
rejected
if
this
new
theory
hypothesis
or
guess
stands
it
can
only
do
so
because
it
harmonizes
with
all
the
facts
the
law
of
gravitation
and
every
other
proven
theory
harmonizes
with
all
the
facts
and
with
all
other
true
theories
it
will
be
shown
in
this
book
that
a
large
number
of
facts
can
not
be
reconciled
with
evolution
especially
the
evolution
of
man
thus
proving
that
it
can
not
be
a
true
theory
we
really
have
a
right
to
demand
the
proof
of
a
theory
and
to
refuse
consent
until
proved
while
we
are
under
no
obligation
to
an
unproven
theory
yet
it
is
the
shortest
way
to
settle
the
matter
once
for
all
before
it
has
led
multitudes
more
astray
and
wrecked
the
faith
and
hopes
of
the
young
newman
in
his
in
evolution
says
as
we
may
be
to
admit
it
honesty
compels
the
evolutionist
to
admit
that
there
is
no
absolute
proof
of
organic
all
the
facts
are
in
accord
with
it
and
none
are
found
that
are
incapable
of
being
reconciled
with
it
a
working
hypothesis
is
said
to
have
been
advanced
to
a
proven
note
this
admission
by
a
leading
evolutionist
even
if
it
should
ever
be
proved
that
all
plant
and
animal
life
came
by
evolution
from
one
primordial
germ
it
would
not
follow
that
either
the
body
or
the
soul
of
man
came
by
evolution
all
the
arguments
against
evolution
in
general
are
valid
against
the
evolution
of
man
in
addition
there
are
many
other
arguments
that
prove
the
evolution
of
man
impossible
even
if
the
evolution
of
plants
and
animals
should
ever
be
proved
possible
in
this
volume
the
claim
is
made
that
the
evolution
of
man
is
irreconcilable
with
a
large
number
of
facts
if
investigation
proves
that
we
have
erred
in
any
statement
of
facts
or
if
our
reasoning
in
any
one
argument
or
more
is
fallacious
we
will
not
lose
our
case
as
long
as
evolution
remains
irreconcilable
with
any
other
single
fact
if
every
argument
in
this
book
were
invalid
save
one
that
one
valid
argument
would
overthrow
evolution
since
every
true
theory
must
be
reconcilable
with
all
the
facts
one
irreconcilable
fact
is
sufficient
to
overthrow
evolution
and
there
are
many
the
unity
of
the
human
race
the
evolution
of
man
is
not
only
a
guess
but
a
very
wild
one
and
it
is
totally
unsupported
by
any
convincing
arguments
it
can
be
mathematically
demonstrated
to
be
an
impossible
theory
every
proof
of
the
unity
of
the
human
race
in
the
days
of
adam
or
noah
shatters
the
theory
of
the
evolution
of
man
if
the
evolution
of
the
human
race
be
true
there
must
have
been
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
ago
a
great
multitude
of
heads
of
the
race
in
many
parts
of
the
earth
without
one
common
language
or
religion
the
present
population
of
the
globe
proves
that
mankind
must
have
descended
from
one
pair
who
lived
not
earlier
than
the
time
of
noah
the
unity
of
languages
also
proves
one
common
head
about
the
same
time
certain
beliefs
and
customs
common
to
various
religions
point
to
one
original
religion
in
historic
time
in
contrast
to
the
evolution
idea
of
many
religions
invented
by
in
millions
of
years
the
history
of
the
world
and
the
migration
of
nations
point
to
one
locality
where
the
human
race
began
in
times
not
more
remote
and
show
that
man
was
created
in
a
civilized
state
and
therefore
never
was
a
brute
if
evolution
were
true
there
would
have
been
many
billion
times
as
many
human
beings
as
now
exist
a
great
multitude
of
invented
languages
with
little
or
no
similarity
a
vast
number
of
invented
religions
with
little
if
anything
in
common
even
the
sciences
invented
and
exploited
by
evolutionists
the
mendelian
inheritance
law
and
biometry
also
prove
evolution
impossible
the
unity
of
mankind
is
also
conclusively
shown
by
the
fact
that
all
races
interbreed
the
most
certain
test
of
every
species
all
these
facts
pointing
to
the
unity
of
the
race
in
the
days
of
noah
and
of
adam
are
irreconcilable
with
the
theory
of
evolution
which
denies
that
unity
within
the
last
two
million
years
we
shall
present
these
arguments
more
in
detail
the
arguments
immediately
following
especially
the
first
eight
show
the
unity
of
the
human
race
in
the
days
of
noah
and
thus
present
insuperable
objections
to
evolution
and
confirm
the
story
of
creation
and
his
destruction
by
the
flood
the
following
is
the
first
of
fifty
arguments
against
the
evolution
of
man
the
population
of
the
world
the
population
of
the
world
based
upon
the
berlin
census
reports
of
was
found
to
be
the
human
race
must
double
itself
times
to
make
this
number
this
result
may
be
approximately
ascertained
by
the
following
computation
at
the
beginning
of
the
first
period
of
doubling
there
would
just
be
two
human
beings
the
second
the
third
the
fourth
the
tenth
the
twentieth
the
thirtieth
and
the
in
other
words
if
we
raise
two
to
the
thirtieth
power
we
have
or
to
the
power
therefore
it
is
evident
even
to
the
school
boy
that
to
have
the
present
population
of
the
globe
the
net
population
must
be
doubled
more
than
thirty
times
and
less
than
times
by
logarithms
we
find
it
to
be
times
after
all
allowances
are
made
for
natural
deaths
wars
catastrophes
and
losses
of
all
kinds
if
the
human
race
would
double
its
numbers
times
we
would
have
the
present
population
of
the
globe
now
according
to
the
chronology
of
hales
based
on
the
septuagint
text
years
have
elapsed
since
the
flood
and
years
since
the
ancestors
of
mankind
numbered
only
two
noah
and
his
wife
by
dividing
by
we
find
it
requires
an
average
of
years
for
the
human
race
to
double
its
numbers
in
order
to
make
the
present
population
this
is
a
reasonable
average
length
of
time
moreover
it
is
singularly
confirmed
by
the
number
of
jews
or
descendants
of
jacob
according
to
hales
years
have
passed
since
the
marriage
of
jacob
by
the
same
method
of
calculation
as
above
the
jews
who
according
to
the
jewish
yearbook
for
number
must
have
doubled
their
numbers
times
or
once
every
years
the
whole
human
race
therefore
on
an
average
has
doubled
its
numbers
every
years
and
the
jews
every
years
what
a
marvelous
agreement
we
would
not
expect
the
figures
to
be
exactly
the
same
nor
be
greatly
surprised
if
one
period
were
twice
the
other
but
their
correspondence
singularly
corroborates
the
age
of
the
human
race
and
of
the
jewish
people
as
gleaned
from
the
word
of
god
by
the
most
proficient
chronologists
if
the
human
race
is
years
old
the
period
of
doubling
would
be
years
or
times
that
of
the
jews
which
of
course
is
unthinkable
while
the
period
of
doubling
may
vary
slightly
in
different
ages
yet
there
are
few
things
so
stable
and
certain
as
general
average
where
large
numbers
and
many
years
are
considered
as
in
the
present
case
no
life
insurance
company
acting
on
general
average
statistics
ever
failed
on
that
account
the
jews
and
the
whole
human
race
have
lived
together
the
same
centuries
with
very
little
intermarriage
and
are
affected
by
similar
advantages
and
disadvantages
making
the
comparison
remarkably
fair
also
the
descendants
of
abraham
must
have
doubled
their
numbers
every
years
during
the
years
since
the
birth
of
his
son
ishmael
these
periods
of
doubling
which
tally
so
closely
years
for
the
whole
race
for
the
jews
and
years
for
the
descendants
of
abraham
can
not
be
a
mere
coincidence
but
are
a
demonstration
against
the
great
age
of
man
required
by
evolution
and
in
favor
of
the
years
since
noah
none
of
the
other
various
chronologies
would
make
any
material
difference
in
these
calculations
the
correspondence
of
these
figures
and
is
so
remarkable
that
it
must
bring
the
conviction
to
every
serious
student
that
the
flood
destroyed
mankind
and
noah
became
the
head
of
the
race
now
the
evolutionists
claim
that
the
human
race
is
years
old
there
is
no
good
reason
for
believing
that
during
all
these
years
the
developing
dominant
species
would
not
increase
as
rapidly
as
the
jews
or
the
human
race
in
historic
times
especially
since
the
restraints
of
civilization
and
marriage
did
not
exist
but
let
us
generously
suppose
that
these
remote
ancestors
beginning
with
one
pair
doubled
their
numbers
in
years
as
rapidly
as
the
jews
or
times
in
years
if
we
raise
to
the
power
the
result
is
with
figures
following
the
population
of
the
world
therefore
would
have
been
decillion
decillion
decillion
decillion
decillion
decillion
decillion
decillion
decillion
decillion
or
vigintillion
vigintillion
vigintillion
vigintillion
vigintillion
vigintillion
or
let
us
suppose
that
man
the
dominant
species
originated
from
a
single
pair
only
years
ago
the
shortest
period
suggested
by
any
evolutionist
and
much
too
short
for
evolution
and
that
the
population
doubled
in
years
the
jewish
rate
of
net
increase
a
most
generous
estimate
the
present
population
of
the
globe
should
be
or
for
every
man
woman
and
child
in
these
calculations
we
have
made
greater
allowances
than
any
evolutionist
could
ask
without
blushing
and
yet
withal
it
is
as
clear
as
the
light
of
day
that
the
ancestors
of
man
could
not
possibly
have
lived
or
or
years
ago
or
even
years
ago
for
if
the
population
had
increased
at
the
jewish
rate
for
years
it
would
be
more
than
two
billion
times
as
great
as
it
is
no
guess
that
ever
was
made
or
ever
can
be
made
much
in
excess
of
years
can
possibly
stand
as
the
age
of
man
the
evolutionist
can
not
sidestep
this
argument
by
a
new
guess
all
these
computations
have
been
made
upon
the
supposition
that
the
human
race
sprang
from
one
pair
if
from
many
in
the
distant
past
as
the
evolutionists
assert
these
bewildering
figures
must
be
enormously
increased
yet
we
are
gravely
told
that
evolution
is
it
is
the
wildest
guess
ever
made
to
support
an
impossible
theory
that
their
guesses
can
not
possibly
be
correct
is
proven
also
by
approaching
the
subject
from
another
angle
if
the
human
race
is
years
old
and
must
double
its
numbers
times
to
make
the
present
population
it
is
plain
that
each
period
for
doubling
would
be
years
since
at
that
rate
there
would
be
fewer
than
four
jews
if
we
suppose
the
race
to
have
sprung
from
one
pair
years
ago
it
would
take
years
to
double
the
population
at
this
rate
there
would
be
five
jews
do
we
need
any
other
demonstration
that
the
evolution
of
man
is
an
absurdity
and
an
impossibility
if
the
evolutionists
endeavor
to
show
that
man
have
descended
from
the
brute
the
population
of
the
world
conclusively
shows
that
man
certainly
did
not
descend
from
the
brute
if
they
ever
succeed
in
showing
that
all
species
of
animals
have
been
derived
from
one
primordial
germ
it
is
impossible
that
man
so
came
he
was
created
as
the
bible
declares
by
the
almighty
power
of
god
the
testimony
of
all
the
experts
in
the
famous
scopes
trial
in
tennessee
who
escaped
was
to
the
effect
that
evolution
was
in
harmony
with
facts
and
therefore
the
above
mathematical
calculations
prove
that
the
evolution
of
man
was
certainly
not
true
they
fail
to
make
their
case
even
if
we
grant
their
claims
these
figures
prove
the
bible
story
and
scrap
every
guess
of
the
great
age
and
the
brute
origin
of
man
it
will
be
observed
that
the
above
calculations
point
to
the
unity
of
the
race
in
the
days
of
noah
years
ago
rather
than
in
the
days
of
adam
years
ago
according
to
chronology
if
the
race
increased
at
the
jewish
rate
not
over
perished
by
the
flood
fewer
than
by
many
a
modern
catastrophe
this
most
merciful
providence
of
god
started
the
race
anew
with
a
righteous
head
now
if
there
had
been
no
flood
to
destroy
the
human
race
then
the
descendants
of
adam
in
the
years
would
have
been
times
the
or
or
computed
at
the
jewish
rate
of
net
increase
for
years
since
adam
the
population
would
have
been
still
greater
or
these
calculations
are
in
perfect
accord
with
the
scripture
story
of
the
special
creation
of
man
and
the
destruction
of
the
race
by
a
flood
had
it
not
been
for
the
flood
the
earth
could
not
have
sustained
the
descendants
of
adam
is
not
this
a
demonstration
decisive
and
final
the
unity
of
languages
the
unity
of
the
languages
of
the
world
proves
the
recent
common
origin
of
man
max
muller
and
other
renowned
linguists
declared
that
all
languages
are
derived
from
one
this
is
abundantly
proven
by
the
similarity
of
roots
and
words
the
grammatical
construction
and
accidents
the
correspondence
in
the
order
of
their
alphabets
etc
the
words
for
father
and
mother
similar
in
form
for
example
are
found
in
many
languages
in
all
the
five
great
groups

the

the
turanian
and
chinese
groups
showing
a

proving
the

the
similarity
of
these
and
many
other
words
in

of

is
no

the

of
the

and

there
can
not
well
be
more
than
generations
of
languages
and
the
time
since
noah
is
sufficient
for
the
development
of
the
languages
and

the
american
indians
have
developed
about
in
or
years
the
life
of
a
language
roughly
speaking
seems
to
range
from
to
years
the
time
since
noah
is
sufficient
for
the
development
of
all
the
languages
of
the
world
but
if
man
has
existed
for
or
years
with
a
brain
capacity
ranging
from
to
normal
there
would
have
been
multiplied
thousands
of
languages
bearing
little
or
no
resemblance
there
is
not
a
trace
of
all
these
languages
they
were
never
spoken
because
no
one
lived
to
speak
them
many
linguists
insist
that
the
original
language
of
mankind
consisted
of
a
few
short
words
possibly
not
over
since
many
now
use
only
about
the
hebrew
has
only
about
root
words
of
letters
the
stagnant
chinese
the
sanscrit
about
the
same
all
the
semitic
languages
have
roots
as
the
tendency
of
all
languages
is
to
grow
in
the
number
and
length
of
words
these
consisting
of
a
few
small
words
must
have
been
close
to
the
original
mother
tongue
no
language
could
have
come
down
from
the
great
antiquity
required
by
evolution
and
have
so
few

modern

over
the
evidence
points
to
the
origin
and
unity
of
languages
in
the
days
of
noah
and
proves
the
great
antiquity
of
man
an
impossibility
and
his
evolution
a
pitiful
absurdity
religions
the
unity
of
ancient
religions
proves
the
creation
of
man
who
received
a
divine
revelation
according
to
evolution
all
religions
were
evolved
or
invented
by
humanoids
in
that
case
we
would
expect
them
to
be
widely
divergent
and
we
would
be
surprised
if
they
agreed
on
great
and
important
points
and
especially
on
points
which
could
not
be
clearly
arrived
at
by
reason
for
instance
what
in
reason
teaches
us
that
an
animal
sacrifice
is
a
proper
way
to
worship
god
how
could
unassisted
reason
ever
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
god
is
properly
worshipped
by
sacrificing
a
sheep
or
an
ox
if
we
grant
that
one
section
of
the
anthropoid
host
might
have
stumbled
on
the
idea
how
can
we
account
for
its
prevalence
or
its
universality
a
very
high
authority
says
were
common
to
all
nations
of
antiquity
and
therefore
traced
by
some
to
a
personal
by
revelation
we
learn
that
the
animal
sacrifice
prefigured
the
lamb
slain
on
calvary
it
was
revealed
no
race
of
could
ever
have
invented
the
idea
the
most
ancient
nations
worshipped
god
by
sacrifices
iliad
and
other
works
of
grecian
poets
are
full
of
it
all
the
classics
greek
and
latin
are
crowded
with
accounts
of
offerings
the
earliest
records
of
the
egyptians
babylonians
assyrians
hindus
and
chinese
speak
of
sacrifices
long
in
vogue
this
unity
of
religions
on
the
point
of
animal
sacrifices
bespeaks
revelation
and
not
evolution
the
division
of
time
into
weeks
of
days
prevalent
among
the
ancients
suggests
an
ancient
revelation
in
commemoration
of
creation
as
against
evolution
which
denies
creation
the
following
statements
from
dummelow
an
eminent
commentator
show
that
the
babylonians
both
divided
time
into
weeks
and
offered
sacrifices
pointing
to
the
unity
of
religions
babylonians
observed
the
and
of
each
lunar
month
as
days
when
men
were
subjected
to
certain
restrictions
the
king
was
not
to
eat
food
prepared
by
fire
offer
sacrifice
nor
consult
an
oracle
nor
invoke
curses
on
his
they
also
observed
the
of
each
month
it
was
customary
therefore
in
the
days
of
abraham
for
the
babylonians
to
offer
sacrifices
and
to
observe
the
day
as
especially
sacred
this
can
only
be
accounted
for
upon
the
assumption
that
god
had
revealed
to
the
human
race
that
creation
occupied
days
or
periods
and
the
was
to
be
observed
of
which
was
doubtless
handed
down
by
tradition
there
were
priests
and
temples
in
the
most
ancient
empire
known
dummelow
says
is
now
widely
admitted
that
the
genesis
account
of
creation
contains
elements
of
belief
which
existed
perhaps
thousands
of
years
before
the
book
of
genesis
was
written
among
the
peoples
of
babylonia
and
many
of
the
primeval

as
well
as
in
the
scattered

of

spoken
by
the
most
savage
the
belief
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
is
well
nigh
universal
even
among
tribes
who
unlike
plato
possess
no
power
to
reason
it
from
the
light
of
nature
in
contrast
we
behold
the
sorry
spectacle
of
the
anthropoid
evolutionists
of
our
day
trying
to
drive
from
the
hearts
of
men
the
hope
of
immortality
by
their
falsely
the
burial
of
the
dead
is
no
doubt
a
relic
since
animals
even
of
the
monkey
tribe
do
not
bury
their
dead
place
of
the
origin
of
man
the
unity
of
the
human
race
is
further
proved
by
the
fact
that
it
originated
in
one
locality
and
not
in
many
the
locality
is
the
one
described
by
moses
and
the
fact
that
moses
correctly
located
the
beginning
of
the
race
when
he
himself
had
no
personal
knowledge
proves
that
he
was
inspired
and
taught
of
god
he
never
could
have
guessed
the
spot
to
which
history
and
the
migration
of
nations
point
and
which
the
evolutionists
themselves
are
obliged
to
concede
the
habitable
countries
of

total
sq

we
are
making
a
generous
estimate
when
we

the

long
sq

there
are
such

located
in

maps

that
mankind

the

this
even

agree
they
draw
a
line
to
giddings
running
through

in
the

there

chance
out

anyone
guessing
might
have
located
the
origin
of

in
any
of
the

this
clearly
demonstrates
that
god
revealed
the
truth
to
moses
and
that
the
story
of
creation
is
true
and
of
evolution
false
if
evolution
were
true
there
must
have
been
years
ago
many
heads
to
the
race
in
many
places
it
is
incredible
that
there
would
be
but
one
spot
where
brutes
became
humans
there
would
be
an
innumerable
host
of
anthropoid
brutes
in
many
parts
of
the
world
in
all
gradations
who
can
believe
that
one
species
or
one
pair
forged
ahead
so
far
as
to
become
human
civilizations
the
early
civilization
of
man
points
to
his
creation
not
his
evolution
evolution
requires
many
centers
of
civilization
creation
only
one
of
course
if
man
is
descended
from
an
ancient
form
and
from
the
primates
and
their
brute
progeny
he
must
have
been
as
uncivilized
and
brutish
as
any
baboon
or
gorilla
today
or
the
apes
which
last
year
horribly
mangled
the
children
at
sierra
leone
he
must
have
worked
his
way
up
into
civilization
the
records
as
far
back
as
they
go
prove
that
the
original
condition
of
man
was
a
state
of
civilization
not
savagery
man
fell
down
not
up
the
recent

of
tutankhamen
in

and
the
more
recent
explorations
of
the
tomb
of

still
more
ancient
egyptian
monarch
show
that
a
high
degree
of
civilization
prevailed
from
to
the

displayed
in
the

the
skill
of
the

beyond
praise
they
had
knowledge

of

are

they
had

claim
that
writing

they
declare
that
the

a

we
are
even
told
that

the

of
reciters

epic
of
homer
scarcely
less
brilliant
is
the
suggestion
of
another
higher

that
iliad
was
not
composed
by
homer

by
another

is
admitted
that
the

sumerian
civilization
began
on

sumerian

probably
the
oldest

in
the

from
the

vocabulary
it
is
evident
that
the

who
spoke
this

had

that
in

higher

have
said
that

that

egypt
was
emphatically
a
land
of

already
in
the
days
of
the
old
empire
the
egyptian
hieroglyphs
had
developed
into
a
cursive
from
the

discovered
in

we
know
that
for
years
people
were

as

in

of
an

the
results

arthur
thompson
of
aberdeen
an
evolutionist
says
research
is
leading
us
away
from
the
picture
of
primitive
man
as
brutish
dull
lascivious
and
bellicose
there
is
more
justification
for
regarding
primitive
man
as
clever
kindly
adventurous
and
it
is
admitted
that
cannibalism
was
not
primeval
the
two
great
revolting
crimes
of
barbarism
cannibalism
and
human
sacrifices
only
prevailed
when
man
had
fallen
to
the
lowest
depths
not
when
he
had
risen
out
of
savagery
to
the
heights
the
assertion
that
man
was
originally
a
brute
savage
and
uncivilized
is
pure
fiction
unsupported
by
the
facts
the
original
civilization
of
mankind
supports
the
bible
and
upsets
evolution
the
mendelian
inheritance
law
the
unity
of
the
human
race
is
further
established
by
inheritance
discovery
on
which
evolutionists
so
much
rely
mendel
an
experimenter
found
that
when
he
crossed
a
giant
variety
of
peas
with
a
dwarf
variety
the
were
all
tall
the
giants
were
called
the
disappearing
dwarfs
but
among
the
second
generation
of
this
giant
offspring
giants
and
dwarfs
appeared
in
the
proportion
of
to
but
when
these
dwarfs
were
successive
generations
were
dwarfs
the
recessive
character
was
not
lost
but
appeared
again
experiments
with
flowers
likewise
show
that
the
recessive
color
will
reappear
also
experiments
with
the
interbreeding
of
animals
have
shown
similar
results
the
recessive
or
disappearing
characteristics
or
the
disappearing
variety
will
appear
again
in
some
subsequent
generation
and
sometimes
becomes
permanent
this
law
prevails
widely
in
nature
and
the
recessive
traits
appear
with
the
dominant
traits
fowl
were
mated
with
fowl
the
offspring
were
all
but
when
these
fowl
were
mated
the
offspring
were
again
and
if
gray
rabbits
were
mated
with
black
rabbits
their
hybrids
were
all
gray
the
black
seemingly
disappearing
but
when
the
second
generation
were
mated
the
progeny
were
again
grays
and
or
recessive
character
always
apply
these
widely
prevalent
laws
to
dominant
man
and
his
recessive
alleged
brute
ancestor
the
simian
characteristics
would
appear
in
some
generations
if
not
in
many
we
would
expect
many
offspring
have
the
recessive
character
of
the
and
we
ought
not
to
be
surprised
if
some
recessive
stock
became
permanent
following
analogy
we
ought
to
look
for
a
tribe
of
human
beings
that
had
degenerated
into
apes
that
we
find
no
such
recessive
characteristics
even
among
the
most
degenerate
savages
and
no
such
tribe
of
human
beings
is
a
decisive
proof
that
man
never
descended
from
the
brute
else
such
recessive
characteristics
according
to
the
mendelian
law
would
be
sure
to
appear
we
would
also
find
monkeys
and
apes
recessive
from
man
biometry
even
new
sciences
founded
by
evolutionists
bear
witness
against
their
theory
inheritance
law
is
one
as
we
have
seen
biometry
is
another
it
was
proposed
and
advocated
by
sir
francis
galton
a
cousin
of
charles
darwin
he
expected
it
to
be
a
great
prop
to
evolution
on
the
other
hand
it
is
another
proof
of
the
unity
of
our
race
in
day
and
hence
fatal
to
their
theory
biometry
is
defined
to
be
the
study
of
variation
and
it
bears
heavily
against
the
great
age
of
man
one
of
the
leading
exponents
of
biometry
davenport
secretary
of
the
eugenics
section
of
the
american
association
concludes
that
people
of
english
descent
are
more
distantly
related
than
thirtieth
cousin
while
most
people
are
more
nearly
related
than
professor
conklin
of
princeton
university
approves
this
conclusion
and
adds
a
matter
of
fact
most
persons
of
the
same
race
are
much
more
closely
related
than
this
and
certainly
need
not
go
back
to
adam
nor
even
to
shem
ham
or
japheth
to
find
our
common
davenport
therefore
says
that
the
english
may
find
a
common
ancestor
generations
ago
professor
conklin
admits
that
we
need
not
go
further
back
than
noah
to
find
a
common
ancestor
of
all
mankind
noah
therefore
must
have
been
the
head
of
the
race
evolutionists
admit
we
need
go
no
farther
back
than
noah
to
find
the
head
of
the
race
and
the
population
as
we
have
seen
proves
the
same
thing
and
disproves
every
guess
they
have
made
of
the
great
age
of
man
we
have
descended
from
noah
and
not
from
the
brute
this
same
professor
conklin
says
that
our
race
began
years
ago
generations
how
is
it
possible
that
we
must
go
back
sixty
thousand
generations
for
a
common
ancestor
when
generations
will
suffice
for
the
english
and
about
generations
since
noah
for
the
whole
race
if
we
by
the
laws
of
biometry
can
find
a
common
ancestor
in
noah
we
can
not
possibly
go
back
years
to
find
one
professor
admission
refutes
his
claim
of
years
for
man
biometry
proves
that
age
absolutely
impossible
if
the
progeny
of
this
ancestor
for
many
generations
certainly
would
have
been
the
we
are
not
only
descended
from
all
the
monkey
family
the
baboon
gorilla
ape
chimpanzee
lemur
ancestor
mongoose
but
are
also
related
to
all
their
progeny
glorious
ancestors
in
our
veins
runs
the
blood
of
them
all
as
well
as
the
blood
of
the
most
disgusting
reptiles
and
yet
professor
newman
an
eminent
evolutionist
in
a
letter
to
the
writer
says
evolution
idea
is
an
ennobling
but
biometry
saves
us
from
such
repulsive
forbears
by
proving
it
could
not
be
so
biometrists
find
that
there
is
a
law
of
filial
regression
or
a
tendency
to
the
normal
in
every
species
checking
the
accumulation
of
departures
from
the
average
and
forbidding
the
formation
of
new
species
by
inheritance
of
peculiarities
the
whole
tendency
of
the
laws
of
nature
is
against
the
formation
of
new
species
so
essential
to
evolution
the
species
brings
forth
still
its
the
average
extreme
peculiarities
of
parents
are
less
extreme
in
stature
of
adult
offspring
must
on
the
whole
be
more
mediocre
than
the
stature
of
the
gifted
parents
rarely
have
children
as
highly
gifted
as
themselves
the
tendency
is
to
revert
to
the
normal
in
body
and
mind
nature
discourages
the
formation
of
new
species
evolutionists
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
produces
is
a
universal
and
unchangeable
law
god
has
forbidden
species
to
pass
their
boundaries
and
if
any
individual
seems
to
threaten
to
do
so
by
possessing
abnormal
peculiarities
these
are
soon
corrected
often
in
the
next
generation
even
professor
newman
says
the
whole
the
contributions
of
biometry
to
our
understanding
of
the
causes
of
evolution
are
rather
a
science
that
upsets
evolution
is
certainly
disappointing
to
evolutionists
no
new
species
now
they
tell
us
that
species
of
plants
and
animals
developed
from
one
primordial
germ
in
years
how
many
new
species
should
have
arisen
in
the
last
years
now
doublings
of
the
first
species
of
animals
would
make
species
since
raised
to
the
power
becomes
again
we
will
favor
the
evolutionists
by
omitting
from
the
calculation
all
species
of
animals
in
excess
of
therefore
on
an
average
each
of
the
doublings
would
take
of
years
or
years
and
therefore
of
the
entire
species
or
species
must
have
originated
within
the
last
years
can
that
be
the
case
certainly
not
and
since
the
number
of
species
must
have
increased
in
a
geometrical
ratio
species
must
have
arisen
or
matured
within
the
last
average
of
one
new
species
of
animals
every
years
how
many
species
actually
have
arisen
within
the
last
years
or
it
is
not
proven
that
single
new
species
has
arisen
in
that
not
one
can
be
named
if
approximately
new
species
have
not
arisen
in
the
last
years
the
evolution
of
species
can
not
possibly
be
true
even
darwin
says
spite
of
all
the
efforts
of
trained
observers
not
one
change
of
species
into
another
is
on
sir
william
dawson
the
great
canadian
geologist
says
case
is
certainly
known
in
human
where
any
species
of
animal
or
plant
has
been
so
changed
as
to
assume
all
the
characteristics
of
a
new
indeed
a
high
authority
says
since
the
human
race
began
all
sorts
of
artificial
agencies
have
been
employed
and
though
there
has
been
the
closest
scrutiny
yet
a
distinctively
new
type
of
plant
or
on
what
is
called
broad
lines
has
come
into
not
a
single
new
species
has
arisen
in
the
last
years
when
the
theory
requires
over
evolutionists
admit
this
vernon
kellogg
of
leland
stanford
university
in
his
of
today
says
by
and
large
we
only
tell
the
general
truth
when
we
declare
that
no
indubitable
cases
of
species
forming
or
transforming
that
is
of
descent
have
been
observed
for
my
part
it
seems
better
to
go
back
to
the
old
and
safe
newman
of
chicago
university
in
answer
to
the
question
many
new
species
have
arisen
in
the
last
years
wrote
this
evasive
reply
do
not
know
how
to
answer
your
questions
none
of
us
know
just
what
a
species
is
if
so
how
could
species
be
counted
the
number
he
says
exists
it
is
difficult
to
say
just
when
a
new
species
has
arisen
from
an
he
does
not
seem
to
know
of
a
single
new
species
within
the
last
years
the
same
question
was
asked
of
osborn
of
columbia
university
y
the
answer
by
murphy
assistant
was
equally
indefinite
he
wrote
every
point
of
view
your
short
note
of
raises
questions
which
no
scientific
man
can
possibly
answer
we
have
very
little
knowledge
as
to
just
when
any
particular
species
of
animal
in
a
later
letter
he
says
have
no
idea
whether
the
number
of
species
which
have
arisen
during
the
last
years
is
or
should
those
who
not
speak
so
confidently
in
favor
of
evolution
or
take
the
and
safe
standpoint
as
kellogg
suggests
the
number
of
existing
species
can
not
be
explained
upon
the
ground
of
evolution
but
only
upon
the
ground
of
the
creation
of
numerous
heads
of
animal
and
plant
life
as
the
scriptures
declare
we
have
a
right
to
increase
the
pressure
of
the
argument
by
introducing
into
the
calculation
the
total
of
species
of
plants
and
animals
which
would
require
new
species
within
the
last
years
or
an
average
of
more
than
one
new
species
a
year
and
they
can
not
point
to
one
new
species
in
years
as
they
confess
j
warren
of
the
university
of
california
said
recently
the
theory
of
evolution
be
true
then
during
many
thousands
of
years
covered
in
whole
or
in
part
by
present
human
knowledge
there
would
certainly
be
known
at
least
a
few
instances
of
the
evolution
of
one
species
from
another
such
instance
is
owen
declares
instance
of
change
of
one
species
into
another
has
ever
been
recorded
by
william
bateson
the
distinguished
english
biologist
said
is
impossible
for
scientists
longer
to
agree
with
theory
of
the
origin
of
species
no
explanation
whatever
has
been
offered
to
account
for
the
fact
that
after
forty
years
no
evidence
has
been
discovered
to
verify
his
genesis
of
although
scientists
have
so
largely
discarded
theory
the
utter
lack
of
new
species
in
historic
time
when
so
many
are
required
by
theory
of
evolution
is
a
mathematical
demonstration
that
the
whole
theory
of
evolution
must
be
abandoned
why
do
they
still
insist
it
be
mathematical
probability
mathematical
probability
is
a
branch

division
of
mathematics
by
means
of
which
the
odds
in

against

may
be
definitely
computed

reveal
how
wild
the
guesses
of

are
the

of

violates
the
rule
of
mathematical
probability
it
is
so
improbable
that
one

out

should
develop
into

that
it
certainly
was
not

a

darwin
after

from

of

has

would
we

one
to

all

there
was
no

would
be
astonished
beyond

if
any

as
the

it
is
unthinkable
that
one

only

reached
the
measureless
distance
between
the

it
violates
mathematical

we
have
a
right
to
expect
in

in

numbers
all
gradations
of

between
the

they
can
not

they

alone
explains
the
great

what
signs
have
we
that
other

ever
approximate
equal

can
we

that
in

distant

a

will
write

a
compose

we
find
all
gradations
of

in

from
the

to
the

why
not
the

gradation
in
conscience
and
the
difference
in
brain
capacity
and
intelligence
between
man
and
the
ape
is
greater
than
the
difference
in
size
between
the
elephant
and
the
housefly
there
are
many
thousands
of
species
to
fill
the
gap
in

why
not
many
thousands

fill
the
greater

in

evidently
no

became
human
by
growth
many
species
like
the

and
the
microscopic

germs
have
not
developed
at
all
but
are
the

as
ever
many
other

of

have
remained
unchanged
during
the
ages
if
the
tendency
is
to

why
do
we
have
so
many

physical
evolution

virtually
ceased

in
so
far
as
any

it

largely
retrogressive
such
changes
are
reduction
of

dulling

thus
contrary

huxley
says
is
an
enormous
gulf
a
divergence
practically
infinite
between
the
lowest
man
and
the

to
declare
that
our
species
alone
crossed
this
measureless
gulf
while
our
nearest
relatives
have
not
even
made
a
fair
start
is
an
affront
to
the
intelligence
of
the
thoughtful
student
it
does
fierce
violence
to
the
doctrine
of
mathematical
probability
it
could
not
have
happened
the
age
of

the
estimates
of
the

of

from
years
to
times
this
number
or
years
even
wells
admits
these
estimates
nearly
always
upon
theoretical
assumptions
of
the
slenderest
this
is
undoubtedly
true
of
the
reckless
estimates
of
evolutionists
whose
theory
requires
such
an
enormous
length
of
time
that
science
can
not
concede
it
newman
says
last
decade
has
seen
the
demise
of
the
outworn
objection
to
evolution
based
on
the
idea
that
there
has
not
been
time
enough
for
the
great
changes
that
are
believed
by
evolutionists
to
have
occurred
given
or
years
since
life
began
we
can
then
allow
years
for
each
important
change
to
arise
and
establish
an
objection
is
not
until
answered
and
to
speak
of
the
demise
of
a
generally
accepted
theory
is
hardly
scientific
we
will
not
allow
the
evolutionist
to
dismiss
so
weighty
an
objection
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
newman
in
his
in
evolution
gives
years
as
the
probable
time
since

the
writer
having
based
arguments
upon
that
assumption

surprised
to
receive
a
private
letter
from
him
claiming
that
life
has
existed
for
years
indeed
russell
of
princeton
says
in
his
lectures
that
the
earth
is
probably
years
old
possibly
we
can
do
nothing
but
gasp
while
the
bewildering
guesses
come
in
and
we
wait
for
the
next
estimate
we
note
their
utter
abandon
as
they
make
a
raid
on
eternity
to
support
a
theory
that
would
dethrone
him
but
these
extravagantly
long
periods
required
by
the
theory
science
can
not
grant
for
the
following
reasons
according
to
the
nebular
hypothesis
and
contraction
theory
accounting
for
the
regular
supply
of
heat
from
the
sun
the
sun
itself
is
not
likely
more
than
years
old
and
of
course
the
earth
is
much
younger
both
of
these
theories
are
quite
generally
accepted
by
scientists
and
have
much
to
support
them
young
of
princeton
in
his
astronomy
says
solar
radiation
can
be
accounted
for
on
the
hypothesis
first
proposed
by
helmholtz
that
the
sun
is
shrinking
slowly
but
continually
it
is
a
matter
of
demonstration
that
an
annual
shrinkage
of
about
feet
in
the
diameter
would
liberate
sufficient
heat
to
keep
up
its
radiation
without
any
fall
in
its
the
sun
is
not
simply
cooling
nor
is
its
heat
caused
by
combustion
for
the
sun
were
a
vast
globe
of
solid
anthracite
in
less
than
years
it
would
be
burned
to
a
we
quote
from
astronomy
can
only
say
that
while
no
other
theory
yet
proposed
meets
the
conditions
of
the
problem
this
contraction
theory
appears
to
do
so
perfectly
and
therefore
has
high
probability
in
its
conclusion
of
geometry
he
continues
more
certain
than
this
the
shrinkage
of
the
sun
to
its
present
dimensions
from
a
diameter
larger
than
that
of
the
orbit
of
neptune
the
remotest
of
the
planets
generate
about
times
as
much
heat
as
the
sun
now
radiates
in
a
hence
if
the
heat
has
been
and
still
is
wholly
due
to
the
contraction
of
its
mass
it
can
not
have
been
radiating
heat
at
the
present
rate
on
the
shrinkage
hypothesis
for
more
than
years
and
on
that
hypothesis
the
solar
system
in
anything
like
its
present
condition
can
not
be
much
more
than
as
old
as
if
so
evolution
on
account
of
lack
of
time
can
not
possibly
be
true
if
we
add
many
millions
of
years
to
this
number
or
double
it
more
than
once
the
time
is
not
yet
sufficient
for
if
the
sun
is
or
even
years
old
by
the
time
the
planets
are
thrown
off
in
turn
from
neptune
to
the
earth
and
then
the
earth
cooled
sufficiently
for
animal
life
only
a
few
million
years
would
be
left
for
evolution
a
mere
fraction
of
the
time
required
this
is
a
mathematical
demonstration
that
evolution
can
not
be
true
the
same
calculations
to
years
have
been
made
by
lord
kelvin
todd
and
other
astronomers
the
thickness
of
the
crust
is
fatal
to
the
theory
of
the
great
age
of
the
earth
required
by
evolution
the
temperature
increases
as
we
descend
into
the
earth
about
one
degree
for
every
feet
or
degrees
per
mile
therefore
at
water
would
boil
at
glass
would
melt
at
every
known
substance
would
melt
hence
the
crust
is
not
likely
more
than
miles
thick
many
places
less
rev
fisher
has
calculated
that
if
the
thickness
of
the
crust
is
as
indicated
by
the
san
francisco
earthquake
the
earth
is
years
old
if
the
crust
is
mi
thick
as
others
say
the
age
would
be
years
lord
kelvin
the
well
known
scientist
who
computed
the
age
at
years
computed
the
age
at
years
subtract
from
these
computations
the
years
that
must
have
elapsed
before
the
earth
became
cool
enough
for
animal
life
and
the
few
millions
of
years
left
would
be
utterly
insufficient
to
render
evolution
possible
note
how
these
figures
agree
with
the
age
of
the
earth
according
to
the
helmholtz
contraction
theory
the
thinness
of
the
crust
is
also
proven
by
the
geysers
the
volcanoes
and
the
tremors
and
earthquakes
occurring
annually
in
all
parts
of
the
world
the
surface
marks
on
the
earth
point
to
much
shorter
periods
of
time
since
the
earth
was
a
shoreless
ocean
than
those
required
by
evolutionists
who
are
so
reckless
in
their
guesses
and
estimates
they
help
themselves
to
eternity
without
stint
charles
lyell
a
geologist
of
time
set
the
example
when
he
said
lowest
estimate
of
time
required
for
the
formation
of
the
existing
delta
of
the
mississippi
is
according
to
careful
examination
made
by
gentlemen
of
the
coast
survey
and
other
officers
the
time
was
disinterested
decision
in
the
face
of
these
three
arguments
it
is
a
bit
reckless
to
say
the
earth
has
existed
years
times
as
long
as
proven
possible
by
mathematical
calculation
and
still
more
reckless
is
the
estimate
of
russell
to
years
founded
on
the
theory
all
these
wild
estimates
are
out
of
the
question
the
recession
of
the
niagara
falls
from
lake
ontario
required
only
to
years
it
required
only
years
for
the
mississippi
river
to
excavate
its
course
winchell
estimates
that
the
mississippi
river
has
worn
a
gorge
feet
deep
miles
long
back
to
the
falls
of
anthony
in
about
years
the
whole
thickness
of
the
nile

feet
in
one
place
was
deposited
in
about
years
calculations
by
southall
and
others
from
certain
strata
have
fixed
first
appearance
on
the
earth
at
years
in
harmony
with
scripture
leconte
in
his
geology
says
due
allowance
for
all
variations
it
is
probable
that
all
are
being
cut
down
and
lowered
by
rain
and
river
erosion
at
a
rate
of
one
foot
every
years
at
this
rate
if
we
take
the
mean
height
of
lands
as
feet
and
there
be
no
antagonistic
agency
at
work
raising
the
land
all
lands
would
be
cut
down
to
the
sea
level
and
disappear
in
may
we
not
from
these
data
judge
approximately
of
the
age
of
the
world
and
show
by
this
proof
also
that
the
world
can
not
be
at
all
as
old
as
the
evolution
theory
demands
if
the
surface
of
the
earth
will
be
worn
down
feet
on
an
average
in
years
would
it
not
also
be
true
that
the
surface
has
been
worn
down
at
least
feet
in
the
last
years
for
the
higher
the
surface
the
more
rapid
the
erosion
and
if
the
earth
is
years
old
as
lord
kelvin
computes
then
at
the
same
rate
it
must
have
been
worn
down
an
average
of
feet
more
than
remains
is
this
not
a
fair
estimate
for
the
amount
of
erosion
and
the
age
of
the
world
how
high
must
the
land
have
averaged
if
the
world
is
even
years
old
if
this
be
true
how
long
would
it
have
taken
erosion
in
the
past
to
reduce
the
land
to
its
present
configuration
short
period
indicated
by
science
or
the
immensely
long
period
required
by
evolution
but
the
evolutionists
are
clinging
to
the
theory
desperately
an
of
a
lost
cause
depending
like
evolution
on
a
great
many
assumptions
and
unproven
hypotheses
the
assumption
is
that
a
substance
like
uranium
or
passes
into
many
other
substances
of
which
radium
is
one
finally
producing
lead
in
years
or
more
from
this
theory
russell
concludes
that
the
earth
is
to
years
old
and
the
sun
is
older
still
during
this
inconceivably
long
period
the
sun
was
giving
out
as
much
heat
as
at
present
which
is
times
as
much
as
the
earth
receives
the
heat
of
the
sun
can
not
be
accounted
for
by
either
the
combustion
or
cooling
off
theory
by
the
commonly
accepted
contraction
theory
the
heat
has
been
maintained
only
about
years
how
could
it
have
been
sustained
to
years
russell
answers
must
therefore
that
energy
from
an
becomes
available
at
exceedingly
high
temperatures
we
can
not
do
more
than
where
it
is
is
this
scientific
this
theory
moreover
is
interlocked
with
theory
of
relativity
which
holds
that
all
energy
has
mass
and
all
mass
is
equivalent
to
energy
although
books
have
been
written
pro
and
con
upon
theory
yet
he
says
only
men
understand
it
and
a
scientist
retorts
that
einstein
can
not
be
one
of
the
the
contraction
theory
the
thickness
of
the
cooled
crust
of
the
earth
and
the
conformation
of
its
surface
all
give
mathematical
proof
that
evolution
is
impossible
because
of
lack
of
time
geology
and
history
during
the
historical
period
the
species
have
remained
unchanged
if
over
species
of
animals
have
arisen
in
the
years
as
is
claimed
over
of
them
must
have
arisen
in
the
last
years
as
evolutionists
can
not
name
a
single
new
species
that
has
arisen
within
that
time
their
theory
falls
to
the
ground
no
species
in
that
time
has
passed
into
another
no
species
has
been
divided
into
two
or
more
no
lower
species
has
advanced
into
a
higher
history
gives
no
scrap
of
evidence
in
support
of
evolution
even
the
horse
whose
history
has
been
dubiously
traced
for
years
has
been
a
horse
unchanged
for
the
last
years
even
if
the
missing
links
in
the
development
of
the
horse
be
supplied
it
would
still
be
the
same
species
all
the
while
but
there
are
no
transitional
forms
showing
alleged
changes
in
the
development
of
the
horse
from
the
creature
of
squirrel
like
size
many
varieties
and
individuals
under
the
skill
of
man
have
been
developed
and
improved
but
not
a
single
new
species
in
historic
time
there
are
varieties
of
apples
but
no
new
species
but
when
the
evolutionist
is
hard
pressed
to
answer
he
takes
to
the
wilds
of
eternity
where
it
is
hard
to
pursue
him
and
to
check
up
on
his
guesses
he
answers
that
changes
are
so
slow
and
take
so
many
millions
of
years
that
they
can
not
tell
of
a
single
new
species
in
the
last
years
when
over
are
required
he
appeals
to
geology
which
is
history
down
to
historic
time
expecting
to
take
advantage
of
the
ignorance
of
the
careless
student
but
geology
will
not
aid
him
to
prove
his
reckless
theory
even
darwin
complained
that
the
evidences
from
geology
were
scanty
geology
testifies
the
genera
and
species
of
fossil
animals
are
as
distinct
as
those
now
living
new
species
appear
at
certain
epochs
entirely
different
from
those
which
preceded
often
the
most
perfect
specimens
of
a
new
species
appear
at
the
beginning
of
a
geologic
period
rather
than
at
its
close
leaving
no
room
for
evolution
no
species
is
shown
changing
into
another
and
many
species
are
largest
at
the
beginning
as
geology
is
brought
in
as
a
hopeful
witness
by
evolutionists
they
are
bound
by
a
principle
of
law
to
accept
the
statements
of
their
own
witness
even
though
fatal
to
their
theory
for
them
geology
furnishes
sorry
evidence
concerning
the
evolution
of
man
from
the
brute
the
great
scheme
of
evolution
claims
as
its
chief
support
four
geologic
we
can
not
be
certain
that
any
one
of
these
has
the
slightest
evidential
value
an
ardent
evolutionist
dubois
found
a
few
bones
part
ape
part
human
buried
in
the
river
feet
deep
they
were
scattered
feet
apart
no
two
joined
together
they
called
this
strange
creature
pithecanthropus
and
fixed
its
age
at
years
others
reduced
it
to
years
these
few
bones
are
no
doubt
from
a
modern
ape
and
modern
man
the
heidelberg
jaw
was
also
found
the
and
is
guessed
to
be
years
old
it
is
hard
to
be
respectful
while
they
gravely
tell
such
stories
but
the
next
is
even
worse
the
piltdown
man
alias
the
piltdown
fake
fabricated
out
of
a
few
bones
of
a
man
and
a
few
of
an
ape
it
is
rejected
as
a
fabrication
even
by
many
evolutionists
the
neanderthal
man
lived
they
say
about
years
ago
a
part
of
a
skull
was
found
in
a
cave
all
the
bones
purporting
to
belong
to
these
four
creatures
would
not
together
make
one
complete
skeleton
or
even
one
complete
skull
a
child
could
carry
all
this
in
a
basket
these
skulls
can
be
duplicated
by
abnormal
skulls
in
many
graveyards
today
scientists
are
not
certain
they
belong
to
the
same
individual
part
ape
part
human
a
desperate
effort
to
get
convincing
evidence
where
there
is
none
we
can
not
be
certain
they
lived
in
the
age
claimed
scientists
even
evolutionists
differ
widely
in
contrast
to
this
scant
and
uncertain
evidence
ales
hrdlicka
of
the
smithsonian
institution
speaking
of
a
single
locality
says
lyons
france
the
skeletons
of
prehistoric
horses
are
scattered
in
one
cave
in
moravia
there
are
enough
mammoth
teeth
to
fill
a
small
sized
hall
from
the
heidelberg
man
there
is
practically
no
record
for
about
years
the
kinship
of
the
piltdown
java
and
heidelberg
man
open
to
the
neanderthal
man
may
not
have
been
a
direct
ancestor
of
the
species
which
produced
shakespeare
napoleon
and
remains
of
the
unchanged
ape
are
abundant
but
the
alleged
human
remains
are
scanty
and
now
if
there
were
millions
and
billions
of
human
beings
developing
from
the
brutes
should
we
not
expect
as
many
remains
as
of
horses
and
mammoths
and
apes
we
do
not
have
millions
of
them
simply
because
they
did
not
exist
is
not
this
well
nigh
a
demonstration
shall
we
upon
this
scant
and
uncertain
evidence
accept
a
theory
that
shocks
the
reason
and
the
moral
sense
of
mankind
and
which
leads
naturally
to
infidelity
and
atheism
and
takes
away
even
our
hope
of
immortality
later
in
this
volume
we
will
consider
more
fully
the
alleged
proofs
from
these
geologic
charles
lyell
said
the
year
the
french
institute
enumerated
not
less
than
geological
theories
which
were
hostile
to
the
scriptures
but
not
one
of
these
theories
is
held
many
have
come
to
the
hasty
conclusion
that
there
was
a
continuous
elaboration
or
a
progressive
growth
among
all
species
true
in
some
cases
but
by
no
means
universal
many
species
have
remained
stable
for
millions
of
years
many
have
retrograded
and
deteriorated
indeed
some
evolutionists
claim
man
has
retrograded
many
species
of
animals
have
been
larger
than
their
modern
descendants
many
species
show
no
change
all
the
bacilli
remain
the
same
microscopic
species
even
those
too
microscopic
to
be
seen
or
isolated
they
multiply
the
same
and
produce
the
same
diseases
how
can
there
be
growth
in
the
microscopic
world
either
animal
or
vegetable
the
doctrine
that
there
is
a
development
and
a
growth
among
all
species
of
animals
or
plants
is
contradicted
by
the
facts
if
that
doctrine
were
true
there
would
be
no
lower
order
of
animals
after
so
many
millions
of
years
of
growth
all
would
have
been
large
and
of
a
high
order
like
others
since
we
find
a
majority
of
all
animal
species
less
in
size
than
the
fly
there
has
been
little
growth
in
most
species
and
in
many
none
at
all
the
amoebae
one
celled
animals
smaller
than
a
small
have
existed
unchanged
since
life
began
if
plants
and
animals
all
developed
from
a
animal
such
as
the
amoeba
why
did
not
the
amoeba
develop
or
if
some
developed
why
not
all
certainly
there
would
not
remain
a
great
multitude
of
species
in
the
microscopic
world
of
many
species
small
and
large
we
have
many
fossils
preserved
but
transitional
the
archæopteryx
a
bird
with
a
feathered
tail
is
the
only
alleged
transitional
form
between
the
reptiles
and
the
birds
only
two
specimens
of
this
same
animal
have
been
found
this
could
easily
be
an
exceptional
species
of
created
birds
differing
no
more
from
the
normal
bird
than
the
ostrich
or
humming
bird
if
there
were
transitional
forms
we
ought
to
have
them
by
the
millions
no
transitional
forms
have
been
found
between
reptiles
and
mammals
and
we
have
seen
that
there
are
no
reliable
forms
between
man
and
mammals
the
numerous
missing
links
make
a
chain
impossible
evolution
is
not
simply
growth
or
change
but
the
development
of
all
species
from
one
germ
geographical
distribution
geographical
distribution
another
witness
claimed
by
the
evolutionists
bears
testimony
which
they
are
bound
in
law
to
receive
we
find
animals
whose
power
of
locomotion
is
very
limited
scattered
all
over
the
world
like
the
mollusca
and
crustacea
embracing
a
large
number
of
families
genera
and
species
it
is
incredible
that
these
all
originated
in
one
place
and
from
one
germ
and
migrated
to
distant
parts
of
the
world
the
oyster
for
example
is
found
in
europe
africa
north
and
south
america
there
are
over
species
found
in
all
warm
tempered
climates
but
none
in
the
coldest
regions
how
could
they
cross
the
ocean
and
be
distributed
along
all
continents
they
are
soon
attached
to
solid
rocks
or
other
supports
and
do
not
move
at
all
and
if
they
do
how
could
they
cross
thousands
of
miles
of
ocean
barren
of
all
food
george
field
an
expert
authority
says
the
oysters
of
europe
are
unisexual
but
in
america
they
are
how
could
one
be
derived
from
the
other
even
the
oyster
is
too
much
for
the
evolutionist
the
same
argument
applies
to
a
great
multitude
of
species
that
have
little
or
no
powers
of
locomotion
if
all
plants
and
animals
originated
from
one
germ
in
one
place
how
can
plants
indigenous
to
a
single
continent
or
hemisphere
be
accounted
for
why
for
example
was
there
no
maize
or
indian
corn
in
the
old
world
or
tomatoes
potatoes
or
any
other
plants
indigenous
to
america
if
these
once
existed
in
the
old
world
as
they
must
have
done
according
to
the
theory
why
were
they
found
in
america
alone
here
we
quote
from
agassiz
one
of
the
greatest
authorities
the
world
ever
knew
will
therefore
consider
the
transmutation
theory
of
species
as
a
mistake
untrue
in
its
facts
unscientific
in
its
method
and
mischievous
in
its
italics
ours
and
yours
god
not
absent
nor
inactive
the
theory
that
god
is
absent
or
inactive
is
as
untenable
and
as
the
discarded
theory
of
atheism
itself
evolution
as
held
by
many
harmonizes
with
and
supports
the
false
and
impossible
assumption
that
god
created
one
or
at
most
a
few
germs
from
which
all
animal
species
including
man
and
plants
developed
by
this
theory
seems
plausible
to
those
who
do
not
examine
it
too
closely
it
does
not
deny
the
existence
of
god
and
concedes
he
may
have
created
one
or
more
germs
but
delegated
the
development
of
an
orderly
world
to
thus
his
activities
are
no
longer
needed
perhaps
they
entertain
the
thought
that
god
must
grow
weary
under
the
active
and
sleepless
control
of
the
universe
if
not
of
the
world
alone
they
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
a
god
of
infinite
mind
and
power
can
not
be
wearied
by
any
possible
complications
or
any
required
amount
of
energy
rather
the
exercise
of
unlimited
energy
is
a
source
of
pleasure
and
happiness
may
we
not
learn
this
from
the
boundless
extent
of
the
universe
creation
is
not
a
task
but
a
great
satisfaction
if
god
finds
so
much
happiness
in
creating
a
boundless
universe
would
he
renounce
the
pleasure
of
the
active
care
and
control
of
species
the
hypothesis
that
god
delegates
to
the
evolution
of
the
universe
the
world
and
all
species
is
untenable
because
no
law
human
or
divine
can
enforce
itself
law
has
no
power
it
is
not
a
being
a
creature
a
living
thing
it
is
absolutely
helpless
it
can
not
be
agent
to
carry
out
his
will
why
the
need
of
it
why
should
not
god
use
his
power
direct
to
do
his
will
what
gain
in
creating
and
employing
an
agent
which
would
be
easier
to
execute
his
own
will
or
delegate
it
to
a
law
his
law
is
simply
the
record
of
his
acts
he
executes
his
own
will
with
exact
regularity
he
does
not
vary
hence
all
his
creatures
may
depend
on
regularity
it
seems
like
law
the
power
in
every
case
is
the
power
of
god
law
has
no
power
the
law
of
gravitation
has
no
power
matter
has
no
power
one
of
the
primary
lessons
we
learn
in
physics
is
the
inertia
of
matter
matter
can
not
move
unless
moved
upon
nor
stop
of
itself
when
once
in
motion
absolutely
powerless
the
power
of
attraction
which
we
may
call
a
property
of
matter
is
really
the
power
of
god
the
effects
are
the
results
of
power
and
intelligence
law
has
neither
power
nor
intelligence
human
law
marks
out
the
course
man
pursue
divine
law
records
the
course
god
pursued
human
law
must
be
enforced
by
all
the
executive
power
of
the
nation
god
executes
his
own
will
with
perfect
regularity
and
by
courtesy
of
language
we
call
it
he
is
the
great
executor
of
the
universe
not
far
removed
but
proven
present
everywhere
by
the
power
and
wisdom
necessary
to
produce
the
results
these
results
are
found
in
the
boundless
universe
and
in
the
microscopic
world
they
are
found
in
the
world
far
below
the
power
of
the
most
powerful
microscope
to
detect
all
the
combinations
of
chemical

made
hidden
from
the
eye
of
the
microscope
substances
are

and
new

made
atoms
are
numbered
counted
and
combined
with
mathematical
precision
and
with
an
intelligence
difficult
for
man
to
compute
no
law
could
do
this
only
a
being
who
has
sufficient
power
and
intelligence
is
equal
to
it
law

no

nor

water
is
composed
of

everywhere
all

of

teems
with
proofs
that

are

in

each

taking
its

in

with
unerring

countless
calculations
of
the
most
difficult
kind
are
made
instantly
and
continually
by
the
divine
mind
thus
presence
everywhere
in
the
minutest
forms
of
matter
is
clearly
proved
it
is
a
mathematical
demonstration
god
is
not
wearied
by
the
care
of
worlds
and
suns
and
systems
and
of
stars
on
the
highway
of
heaven
and
takes
just
as
perfect
notice
of

and
electrons
they
who
think
god
is
unable
or
unwilling
to
take
care
of
the
minutest
division
of
matter
as
well
as
the
rolling
suns
must
have
a
very
diluted
idea
of
god
it
is
now
claimed
that
the
atom
formerly
believed
to
be
the
smallest
division
of

consists
of
parts
sir
oliver
lodge
says
that
the
structure
of
an
atom
is
as
complex
as
that
of
a
piano
this
latest
scientific
discovery
detects
the
power
and
wisdom
of
god
controlling
for
ages
this
minutest
division
of
matter
undetected
by
the
most
powerful
microscope
it
staggers
one
to
think
of
the
countless
and
difficult
calculations
that
are
made
instantly
by
the
divine
mind
in
every
part
of
the
universe
the
path
of
every
snowflake
that
lazily
pursues
its
tortuous
course
and
rests
upon
the
lap
of
earth
is
marked
out
not
by
any
law
or
agent
but
by
god
himself
he
calculates
instantly
the
path
the
movement
of
every
particle
of
air
the
direction
velocity
and
path
of
every
raindrop
a
law
could
not
do
it
the
wisest
man
could
not
do
it
but
god
can
do
it
with
the
ease
with
which
the
tempest
carries
a
feather
on
its
bosom
or
the
ocean
floats
a
straw
every
second
about
tons
of
rain
and

fall
to
the

and
god
calculates
the

of
the

instantly

unerringly
the

of

often
on

require
bewildering
calculations
by
an

no

not
even

can
be
lost
in
converting
one

into
another
it
must
be
computed
exactly
who
but
an
infinite

could
have
calculated
the
enormous

in

of

of
the

can
be
so
reckless
as
to
say
that
god
is
absent

not
only
does
god
make
endless
calculations
in
executing
his
will
in
the
material
universe
but
in
the
intellectual
moral

spiritual
world
as

can
not
measure
with
any
human
instruments
the
amount
of
mental

god
calculates
unerringly
the

the
amount
is
in
precise
proportion
to
the

the
gain
is
definite
exact
and
unerring
the
calculation
is
instantaneous
and
beyond
the
power
of
the
profoundest
mathematician
to
compute
so
also
the
effect
of
every
moral
act
wish
desire
purpose
intention

is
instantly
computed
and
the
moral
character
modified
in

if
a

indulges
in
vice
he
becomes
vicious
in

if
he
commits
a
crime
he
becomes
more
criminal
in

every
theft
is
computed
at
its
proper
value
every
good
and
noble
act
ennobles
the
character
in

to
its
worth
there
is
a
settlement
every

and
all
deeds
wishes

purposes
and

go
into

it
in

who

can
keep
all

no

nor
could
do
it

every
spiritual

go

of

in

to

not
all
the
mathematicians
and
scribes
in
the
universe
could
together
solve
the
problems
that
the
great
intellect
of
the
supreme
ruler
is
solving
every
instant
of
time
this
theory
of
an
absent
or
inactive
god
leaves
no
place
for
prayer
an
almost
universal
instinct
of
mankind
if
a
blind
deaf
and
dumb
and
helpless
law
is
in
control
it
is
useless
to
pray
for
help
all
nations
races
and
peoples
instinctively
believe
that
god
hears
and
answers
prayer
this
is
a
scientific
fact
with
which
evolutionists
must
reckon
even
if
it
has
a
pious
or
otherwise
offensive
sound
no
use
to
pray
to
an
inexorable
which
like
the
gods
of
the

can
neither
see

hear
nor
taste
nor

how
unscientific
then
seems
the
following
declaration
of

my
mind
it
accords
better
with
what
we
know
of
the
laws
impressed
on

how
could
that
be
by
the
creator
that
the
production
and
extinction
of
the
past

inhabitants
of
the

should
have
been
due
to
secondary
causes

not
remove
the
first
great
cause
from

of

to
call

chance
or

evolution
is
the
old
heathen
doctrine
of
chance
it
professes
to
eliminate

and
a

the

allows
no

they

this

the

i
frankly

absurd

goes

take

unscientific
attitude
they
try
to
establish
their
theory
in
spite
of
overwhelming
arguments
tells
me
he
says
if
numerous
gradations
from
a
simple
and
imperfect
eye
to
one
complex
and
perfect
can
be
shown
to
exist
such
gradation
being

certainly
the

say
certainly
the

are
unfavorable
if
such

should
be

what
if
not
useful
to
any

under

then
the
difficulty
of
believing
that
a

be
formed
by

insuperable
to

should
not
be
considered
as

of
the

undertakes
a
task
far
too
great
for
his
mighty
genius
that
a
perfect

could
be
is
many
moral
leagues
from
proving
that
it
was
so

we
must
have
stronger
proof
than
sufficient
to
lead
us
to
believe
that
such
an

could
possibly
be
so
formed
all
proof
is
exhausted
in
the
struggle
to
prove
the
possibility
of
the

of
so
marvelous
an

to
say
nothing
of
the

much
less
the

we
hold

to
the

we
demand
it
otherwise
we
shall
certainly
it
subversive
of

if
acquired

how
could
it
benefit
another

but
we
must
contest
the
claim
that
the

of

animals
have
been
formed
by
evolution
whole
theory
aims
to
account
for
all
creation
with
its
evidences
of
design
by
natural
selection
which
works
without

and
without
intelligence
the
theory
is
founded
upon
the
monstrous
assumption
that
unintelligent
animals
and
plants
can
by
aimless
effort
arrive
at
such
perfection
as
the
organs
of
the
human

exceeding
anything
in

contrivance
invented

by
the

indeed
that

of

is
but
a
poor
imitation
of
the

and
does
not
begin
to
equal
it

who
would
say
that
the

might

by

or
the
fortuitous

by
natural

or
any
other
attempted
method
of
blotting
out
the
great
intelligent
designer
of

it
not
only
absurd
in
the
highest
degree
but
certainly
and
is
fatal
to
the
theory
the
eye
is
so
wonderful
in
its
powers
and
delicate
adjustments
that
we
stand
amazed
at
the
evidences
of

at
the
wisdom
of
the
maker
of
the

far
exceeding
the
highest
inventive
genius
of

to
say
that
this
is
the

is
absurd

ridiculous
evolution
eliminates

an
active

ever

and
substitutes
blind

natural

dubs
it
and
asks
the

to
believe
it
according
to
the
evolution
theory
the
gain
in
the
mechanism
of
the
eye
causes
its
possessors
to
survive
and
others
to
die
is
that
true
are
there
not
many
species
that
survive
whose
eyes
are
less
perfect
than
the
eye
of
man
indeed
it
is
claimed
that
many
animals
have

superior
to

if
so
why
did
man
survive
and
become
the
dominant
species
with

less

the
compound
eyes
of
some

are
superior

darwin
makes
a

says

however
at
a
conclusion
regarding
the
formation
of
the

with
all
its

not

it
is
indispensable
that
the

i

the

themselves

from
that
of
the
red

cherries
can
it
be
possible
that
the

becomes
more
perfect
because
those
who
had
less
perfect
eyes
perished
and
only
those
who
could
recognize

survive
until

blindness
is
finally
eliminated
is
such
a

scientific
is
it
more
reasonable
to

it
than
to
believe
that

of

the
ability
to
recognize

is
only
one
of
the

perfections
of

evolution
is
made
so
much
more
incredible
because
it
teaches
that

is
made
at

of

that
perished

convince
the

that

how
could
he
account
for

the

we

the
evolutionist
guesses
that
it
came
into

by
design
or
act
of

give
you
the
guess
piece
of
pigment
or
as
some
say
a
freckle
appeared
upon
the
skin
of
an
animal
that
had
no
eyes
this
piece
of
pigment
or
freckle
converged
the
rays
of
the
sun
upon
that
spot
and
when
the
little
animal
felt
the
heat
on
that
spot
it
turned
the
spot
to
the
sun
to
get
more
heat
this
increased
heat
irritated
the
skin
the
evolutionists
a
nerve
came
there
and
out
of
the
nerve
came
the
eye
can
you
beat
it
but
this
only
accounts
for
one
eye
there
must
have
been
another
piece
of
pigment
or
freckle
soon
afterward
and
just
in
the
right
place
in
order
to
give
the
animal
two
now
assuming
what
seems
an
utter
impossibility
that
the
wonderful
mechanism
of
the
eye
can
be
accounted
for
by
chance
or
natural
selection
another
name
for
chance
since
design
is
excluded
how
can
we
account
for
the
of
the
eyes
and
in
fact
of
all
the
other
organs
of
the
body
we
can
easily
calculate
the
mathematical
probability
on
the
basis
of
natural
selection
there
are
from
to
square
inches
of
surface
to
the
human
body
a
space
easily
times
the
space
occupied
by
an
eye
the
eye
by
the
laws
of
probability
is
just
as
likely
to
be
located
any
where
else
and
has
one
chance
out
of
to
be
located
where
it
is
but
out
of
our
abundant
margin
we
will
concede
the
chance
to
be
one
out
of
and
hence
its
mathematical
probability
is
for
mathematical
probability
includes
possibility
and
even
improbability
the
compound
probability
of
two
things
happening
together
is
ascertained
by
multiplying
together
their
fractions
of
probability
now
the
probability
of
the
location
of
the
second
eye
where
it
is
also
is
and
the
compound
probability
of
the
location
of
both
eyes
where
they
are
is
x
or
in
like
manner
the
probability
of
the
location
of
each
ear
where
it
is
is
and
of
the
two
ears
the
compound
probability
of
the
location
of
two
eyes
and
two
ears
where
they
are
is
x
or
the
two
eyes
and
two
ears
have
but
one
chance
out
of
a
trillion
or
a
million
million
to
be
located
where
they
are
the
location
of
the
mouth
the
nose
and
every
organ
of
the
body
diminishes
this
probability
a
thousand
fold
we
are
speaking
mildly
when
we
say
that
this
calculation
proves
that
the
evolution
of
the
body
by
chance
or
natural
selection
has
not
one
chance
in
a
million
to
be
true
so
ruthlessly
does
the
pure
and
reliable
science
of
mathematics
shatter
the
theory
of
evolution
which
so
called
scientists
claim
is
as
firmly
established
as
the
law
of
gravitation
concerning
the
wild
guess
of
the
development
of
the
legs
we
again
quote
from
bryan
his
image
according
to
the
evolutionist
there
was
a
time
when
animals
had
no
legs
and
so
the
legs
came
by
accident
how
well
the
guess
is
that
a
little
animal
was
wiggling
along
on
its
belly
one
day
when
it
discovered
a
just
happened
so
it
was
in
the
right
place
to
be
used
to
aid
it
in
locomotion
so
it
came
to
depend
upon
the
wart
and
use
finally
developed
it
into
a
leg
and
then
another
wart
and
another
leg
at
the
proper
accidentally
in
the
proper
place
is
it
not
astonishing
that
any
person
intelligent
enough
to
teach
school
would
talk
such
tommyrot
to
students
and
look
serious
while
doing
so
some
one
has
counted
that
darwin
has
used
phrases
of
doubt
like
may
well
suppose
times
in
his
two
principal
works
the
whole
theory
is
built
up
on
guesses
and
suppositions
us
that
each
guess
is
per
cent
certain
which
is
far
higher
than
the
average
or
any
the
compound
probability
would
equal
raised
to
the
power
which
would
be
which
means
there
are
chances
out
of
a
quintillion
that
evolution
is
true
since
not
all
of
these
suppositions
are
dependent
upon
each
other
we
are
willing
to
multiply
this
result
by
which
still
shows
that
the
theory
has
less
than
one
chance
in
a
million
to
be
true
darwin
himself
says
belief
that
an
organ
so
perfect
as
the
eye
could
have
been
formed
by
natural
selection
is
more
than
enough
to
stagger
any
yet
he
and
his
followers
refuse
to
be
and
proceed
to
argue
as
if
this
unanswerable
objection
had
little
or
no
weight
hypothesis
is
weakened
or
damaged
by
every
support
that
is
an
uncertain
gravitation
has
no
such
support
alfred
mccann
in
his
great
volume
or
gorilla
shows
that
wells
the
novelist
historian
in
his
of
history
uses
pages
to
show
descent
from
an
ancestry
and
employs
expressions
of
doubt
or
uncertainty
such
as
etc
he
does
not
hesitate
to
endorse
the
wildest
guesses
of
the
evolutionists
and
sits
upon
the
top
of
this
pyramid
of
doubt
and
proclaims
apparently
without
a
blush
of
our
ancestors
was
elsewhere
he
says
the
lemur
was
our
ancestor
it
clambered
about
the
trees
and
ran
and
probably
ran
well
on
its
hind
legs
upon
the
ground
it
was
small
brained
by
our
present
standards
but
it
had
clever
hands
with
which
it
handled
fruit
and
beat
nuts
upon
the
rocks
and
perhaps
caught
up
sticks
and
stones
to
smite
its
fellows
it
was
our
and
he
does
not
hesitate
to
give
a
picture
of
our
ancestor
drawn
by
an
artist
years
after
its
death
yet
this
book
so
dangerous
so
and
so
untruthful
concerning
the
origin
of
man
is
recommended
by
careless
librarians
by
scholars
and
even
by
christians
it
will
take
a
long
time
to
erase
from
the
mind
of
the
youth
the
false
teachings
of
this
book
it
is
one
of
the
most
cunningly
devised

ever
attempted
to
teach
infidelity
and
atheism
in

all

with

he
made

for
his

he
provided
many
things
useful
to

but
to
no

a

did
not

it

false

this
raises
a
presumption
against

as
falsehood
does
not
agree
with
the

it
is
reconcilable
with

but
not
with

many
like
coulter
of
the
chicago

endeavor
to
show
that

reconcilable
with

does
show
that
it
harmonizes

the
religion
of

or
infidelity
no
one
doubts
that
evolution
harmonizes
with
atheism
or
the
religion
of
thomas
paine
but
why
should
we
be
anxious
to
reconcile
it
with
christianity
when
there
is
so
little
truth
to
support
it
many
evolutionists
are
atheists
some

this

and

can
not

mind
controls

mind
hence
the
mind
of

some
believe
the
universe
came
into
being
by
its
own
power
though
that
can
not
be
power
or
force
can
not
create
itself
it
must
be
attached
directly
or
indirectly
to
a

no
force
can
be
disconnected
from

detached
force
is
unthinkable
all
force
in
the

can
be
traced
to
god
much
of
the
physical
power
of
the
earth
can
be
traced
to
the
sun
cataracts
steam
electricity
the
sun
gets
its
power
from

gravitation
extensive
as
the
universe
is
but
the
power
of
god
in
each
case
the
total
force
in
the

beyond
calculation
it
is
a
part
of
the

of

approaches
infinity
all

is
convertible
into

into

the

of

may
be
converted
into

the

had
lifted
the
waters
of
the
whole
niagara
river
and
the

far
above
the

its
power
is
enormous
it
lifts
up
over
tons
of
water
to
the
clouds
every
day
than
all
the
rivers
and
streams
pour
into
the

the
sun
equals
in
size
a
pile
of
more
than
a
million
worlds
like
ours
every
square
yard
of
surface
of
this
enormous
sphere
has
enough
heat
to
push
a
great
liner
across
the
sea
much
power
as
in
many
tons
of
coal
the
amount
of
heat
in
the
surface
of
the
sun
consisting
of
more
than
sq
can
hardly
be
imagined
the
heat
of
one

mi
sq

would
drive

sea
times
as
many
as

more
than

as
much
heat
as
the
earth
receives
goes
out

and
this
enormous
amount

is
but
a
poor
fraction
of
the

of
suns
few
of
which
are
so
small

a
single
star
betelguese
has
recently
been
computed
to
be

therefore
larger

like
ours
a
still
more
recent

even

equal
to

if

it

alpha
hercules

that
it
takes

years
to
reach
us
at
the
rate

in

some
say
there
are
enormous

compute
if
you
can
the
sum
total
of
the
power
causing
the
light
and
heat
and
the
power
of

controlling
these
vast
swarms
of

all
this
power
is
the
power
of
god
and
a
weak
fraction
of
the
total
this
power
could
not
originate
itself
it
could
not
grow
it
could
not
come
by

it
could
not
come
by

the
doctrine
of
the
conservation
of

accepted
by
scientists
proves
that
no

be
lost
a

this

no

it

which
is
entirely
without

indeed
if
spontaneous
generation
were
possible
at
the

it
is
possible
now
and
has
been
possible
during
all
the

no

of
it
has
been
given
on
the
contrary
all
efforts
to
secure
by
chemistry
the
lowest
forms
of
life
from
dead
matter
have
been
without

leib
of
chicago
university
made
earnest
efforts
to
do
so
he
failed
utterly
if
nature
aided
by
the
genius
of
man
can
not
now
produce
the
lowest
forms
of
life
from

how
could
it
ever
have
been
done
huxley
filled
jars
with
sterilized
water
and
placed
in
it
sterilized
vegetation
and
sealed
them
up
and
after
years
no
life
was
seen
disproving
spontaneous

pasteur
proved
that
if
milk
were
sterilized
there
would
be
no

of

by

this
discovery
was

value

tyndall
the
distinguished

said
matter
is
what
the
world
believes
it
to
be
materialism
spontaneous
generation
and
evolution
or
development
are
absurdities
too
monstrous
to
be
entertained
by
any
sane
clark
maxwell
another
distinguished
physicist
says
have
examined
all
theories
of
evolution
and
have
found
that
every
one
must
have
a
god
to
make
it
says
hypotheses
tend
to
nothing
less
than
the
shutting
out
of
god
from
the
thoughts
and
hearts
of
men
and
the
diffusion
of
the
leprosy
of
materialism
the
savant
who
invents
and
propagates
them
is
either
a
criminal
or
a
even
darwin
seems
to
be
conscious
of
a
designing
mind
when
he
says
is
difficult
to
avoid
personifying
the
word
nature
but
i
mean
by
nature
only
the
aggregate
action
and
product
of
many
natural
a
futile
effort
to
exclude
god
who
made
these
laws
can
a
theory
that
is
consistent
with
false
theories
like
chance
and
atheism
be
true
truth
is
consistent
with
truth
but
not
with
falsehood
we
can
judge
a
theory
by
the
company
it
keeps
evolution
naturally
affiliates
with
false
theories
rather
than
with
the
truth
it
favors
infidelity
and
atheism
a
theory
in
perfect
harmony
with
manifest
error
raises
a
presumption
against
its
truth
evolution
seems
to
have
a
natural
attraction
for
erroneous
hypotheses
and
manifests
the
closest
kinship
with
impossible
theories
this
is
not
a
mark
of
a
true
theory
so
baneful
has
been
the
effect
of
teaching
evolution
as
a
proven
hypothesis
that
multitudes
have
been
led
into
infidelity
and
atheism
james
leuba
of
bryn
mawr
college
sent
a
questionaire
to
of
the
most
prominent
scientists
teaching
sciences
relating
to
evolution
the
replies
indicate
that
more
than
do
not
believe
in
a
personal
god
nor
the
immortality
of
the
soul
almost
universal
even
in
the
heathen
world
so
pernicious
is
this
doctrine
of
evolution
that
more
than
of
the
professors
who
teach
it
and
kindred
subjects
are
infidels
and
atheists
and
farther
from
god
than
the
ignorant
heathen
and
while
we
are
happy
in
the
conviction
that
the
great
majority
of
professors
and
teachers
of
other
subjects
are
christians
yet
one
or
two
atheists
or
infidels
are
sufficient
to
make
havoc
of
the
faith
of
many
in
a
great
college
or
university
a
doctrine
so
abhorrent
to
the
conscience
so
contrary
to
the
well
nigh
universal
belief
and
so
fruitful
of
evil
certainly
can
not
be
true
small
wonder
is
it
that
students
are
fast
becoming
infidels
and
atheists
and
we
shudder
as
we
think
of
the
coming
generation
a
great
responsibility
rests
upon
the
authorities
who
employ
such
teachers
the
answers
of
the
students
in
seven
large
representative
colleges
and
universities
to
questionaire
show
that
while
only
of
the
freshmen
have
abandoned
the
christian
religion
of
the
juniors
and
over
of
the
seniors
have
abandoned
the
christian
faith

the

they

the

lived

later
the

is
reduced
to
does
any

in

believe
that
an

developed
of
the

in

it

and

all
these

are
clearly
impossible
but
the
agile

may
try
to
escape
the
death
sentence
of
mathematics
and
the
condemnation
of
reason
by
saying
that
the

developed
more
rapidly

so
the
pithecanthropus
must
have
lived
more
than

so
swiftly
does
inexorable
mathematics
upset
this
reckless
theory
this
calculation
has
been
made
upon
the
basis
of
the
estimate
of
years
since
life
began
taken
from
newman

but
seeing
that
even
this
great
estimate
of
the
period
of

is
not
sufficient
for

in

letter
to
the
writer
newman
raises
his
guess
to
years
in
that
case
the
pithecanthropus
must
have
lived
of
or
years

and
if
we
are
reckless
enough
to
admit
the
of

gravely
suggested
by
russell

it

these

seem

in

causes
the

let
us
take
another
view
let
us
assume
that
the
pithecanthropus
really
lived
years
ago
as
claimed
which
is
of

therefore
its
brain
capacity
then
should
have
been

or
or
less
than
the
normal
also

is
only
of
years
hence
in
that
case
the

should
have
been
normal
or
in
either
case

must
have
excelled

of

all
these
calculations
prove
positively
that
no
such
creatures
as
these
four
alleged
ever
could
have
lived
in
the
age
assigned
to
them
or
if
so
that
none
could
have
had
at
that
time
the
low
brain
capacity
claimed
is
it
not
plain
that
for
the
last
years
out
of
years
the
developing
human
race
must
have
been
over
or
normal
in
intelligence
morality
and
spirituality
this
is
greater
than
that
of
many
peoples
today
with
this
high
degree
of
intelligence
man
was
capable
of
great
inventions
and
discoveries
not
a

we
would
expect
some
great
monument
like
the

of

a

with
such

for
so
many

would
have
been
able
to
reach
the
heights
of

discovery
and
learning
of
the
present
age
not
a
whit
of
evidence
comes
down
to
us
if
years
ago
man
had
the
same
skull
capacity
as
the
ape
he
has
gained
in
years
and
only
in
years
his
improvement
in
the
last
years
must
have
been
times
as
rapid
as
during
the
preceding
years
or
times
as
rapid
as
during
the
preceding

how
was
that
possible
eight
impassable
gulfs
the
evolution
theory
stretching
from
matter
to
man
is
impossible
because
of
many
impassable
gulfs
some
of
these
impassable
gulfs
are
between
the
living
and
or
dead
matter
between
the
vegetable
and
the
animal
kingdoms
between
the
invertebrates
and
the

between

animals
and

between

and

between

and

between

between

and
the
human
body
between
soulless
simians
and
the
soul
of
man
bearing
the
image
of
god
there
is
not
a
scrap
of
evidence
that
these
gulfs
have
ever
been
crossed
in
the
scheme
the
material
must
become
living
by
spontaneous
generation
some
plants
must
become

animals
some

some

some

some

some

some

soulless

must
acquire

and
become

enough
to
bear
the
image
of
god
there
is
no
convincing
proof
that
any
of
these
great
and
incredible
advances
were
ever
made
if
we
estimate
the
probability
of
each
transmutation
at
which
is
too
high
then
the
probability
that
all
these
changes
up
to
man
were
made
is
raised
to
the
power
therefore
there
is
not
more
than
one
chance
out
of
that
these
changes
were
made
and
if
we
estimate
the
probability
of
each
great
change
at
which
is
doubtless
still
too
high
the
probability
that
man
took
these
great
steps
of
evolution
is
one
out
of
or
a
million
million
million
million
if
we
estimate
the
probability
of
each
change
even
at
which
is
far
above
all
reason
the
probability
of
evolution
through
these
changes
is
only
out
of
which
marks
an
improbability
close
to
an
impossibility
the
highest
estimate
we
can
reasonably
make
destroys
all
hope
that
man
or
even
any
other
species
could
have
come
by
evolution
few
persons
realize
how
improbable
an
event
is
made
which
depends
upon
a
number
of
possibilities
or
even
probabilities
until
calculated
by
the
rule
of
compound
mathematical
probability
imagine
the
copernican
or
the
gravitation
theory
depending
on
a
number
of
possibilities
or
probabilities
no
true
theory
is
built
on
such
an
uncertain
foundation
but
if
the
evolutionists
could
prove
that
out
of
of
the
great
changes
certainly
did
occur
but
failed
to
prove
the
they
would
lose
their
case
but
they
have
failed
in
all
they
must
prove
all
to
win
there
is
not
the
slightest
probability
that
any
one
of
these
changes
ever
occurred
hence
the
evolution
of
man
from
this
long
line
of
alleged
ancestors
is
an
absolute
impossibility
none
of
these
changes
is
occurring
there
is
no
spontaneous
generation
now
darwin
himself
said
that
spontaneous
generation
in
the
past
was
no
reptiles
are
becoming
mammals
none
becoming
birds
no
apes
or
monkeys
are
becoming
men
no
species
is
now
transmuted
into
another
no
new
species
arises
is
not
this
proof
enough
that
such
great
changes
never
occurred
moreover
if
dead
matter
caused
one
living
germ
why
did
it
not
cause
more
if
some
reptiles
developed
into
mammals
and
birds
why
not
all
if
one
family
of
simians
became
human
why
not
others
why
not
at
least
become
anthropoids
why
did
all
other
members
of
the
simian
family
not
become
at
least
part
human
why
have
they
remained
stationary
besides
we
have
with
us
yet
the
invertebrates
that
have
not
yet
become
vertebrates
marine
animals
that
have
not
become
amphibians
amphibians
that
have
not
become

reptiles
that
have
become
neither
mammals
nor

and
a
multitude
of
simians
that
have
not
become
human
and
are
not
moving
toward
man
either
in
bodily
form
or
intelligence
or
spirituality
we
have
the
amoeba
the
microscopic
animals
and
the
lowest
forms
of
animal
life
if
the
great
law
of
progress
and
advancement
to
higher
forms
has
prevailed
for
so
many
million
years
there
should
be
none
but
the
highest
species
all
should
have
reached
the
status
of
human
beings
and
there
should
be
none
of
the
lower
forms
of
life
which
are
so
abundant
changes
so
radical
and
vast
stretching
through
so
many
ages
would
require
millions
of
connecting
links
if
reptiles
became
hairy
mammals
we
would
expect
fossils
of
thousands
if
not
millions
in
the
transition
state
if
some
reptiles
were
changed
into
the
species
of
birds
we
would
expect
countless
fossils
part
reptile
part
bird
only
one
is
claimed
the
archæopteryx
ancient
bird
two
specimens
of
which
are
known
which
had
a
feathered
tail
and
which
is
only
a
slight
modification
of
other
birds
many
other
birds
have
departed
farther
from
the
normal
there
should
be
millions
of
fossils
in
the
transition
state
if
the
theory
were
true
we
have
proven
elsewhere
that
there
is
no
credible
evidence
of
links
connecting
man
with
the
monkey
family
there
would
have
been
many
millions
we
have
shown
at
length
that
some
of
these
great
changes
especially
the
evolution
of
man
from
the
brute
could
never
have
occurred
no
one
of
these
nine
great
advances
was
ever
made
but
it
will
suffice
to
examine
now
as
examples
two
alleged
great
changes
reptiles
into
mammals
and
reptiles
into
birds
evolutionists
say
that
mammals
are
descended
from
some
reptiles
unknown
of
course
and
birds
from
others
also
unknown
mammals
differ
from
reptiles
in
having
breasts
latin
mammae
a
four
chambered
heart
instead
of
three
a
coat
of
hair
or
fur
or
wool
and
a
womb
for
the
young
the
temperature
of
the
blood
of
reptiles
is
as
low
as
and
even
degrees
since
the
temperature
of
the
blood
is
about
the
same
as
the
environment
sometimes
approaching
the
freezing
point
but
mammals
have
a
temperature
approaching
we
are
to
believe
that
one
progressive
branch
of
reptiles
which
passed
through
the
sieve
of
natural
selection
during
the
permian
ice
age
was
capable
of
being
adapted
to
the
colder
climate
but
this
mighty
chasm
between
reptiles
and
mammals
was
crossed
unaided
by
any
external
interference
unaided
by
god
then
the
mammals
groped
their
way
without
intelligence
or
design
up
to
man
the
difficulties
are
too
great
to
satisfy
the
serious
student
no
satisfactory
explanation
has
been
given
no
fossils
part
reptile
part
mammal
have
been
found
we
would
naturally
expect
millions
of
them
evidently
none
ever
existed
how
could
such
radical
changes
be
brought
about
what
caused
the
development
of
hair
fur
and
wool
the
change
in
the
heart
and
the
temperature
the
formation
of
the
mammae
and
of
the
womb
there
is
no
evidence
of
such
change
but
it
is
necessary
to
the
scheme
some
reptiles
became
birds
they
say
whether
a
pair
for
each
of
the
species
of
birds
or
one
pair
for
all
we
can
not
learn
for
nobody
knows
they
would
like
for
us
to
believe
that
these
reptiles
with
a
temperature
of
to
degrees
became
birds
with
a
temperature
as
high
as
that
wings
and
feathers
were
developed
which
must
have
been
perfectly
useless
through
the
long
ages
during
which
they
were
developing
that
the
wonderful
contrivances
in
the
wings
and
feathers
were
made
by
senseless
reptiles
that
did
not
know
what
they
were
doing
reptiles
have
a
heart
making
them
birds
have
a
heart
and
a
temperature
higher
than
that
of
man
reptiles
left
their
eggs
to
hatch
in
the
sun
birds
by
a
fine
instinct
built
their
nests
with
care
some
reptiles
have
feet
some
some
none
all
birds
have
two
feet
the
structure
is
so
well
suited
for
flight
and
shows
the
marks
of
design
so
clearly
that
the
clumsy
aeroplane
is
but
a
poor
imitation
yet
to
link
the
species
of
birds
to
their
unknown
reptilian
ancestors
they
show
us
two
fossils
of
the
archæopteryx
as
the
sum
total
of
the
evidence
showing
the
transition
from
reptiles
to
birds
the
fossil
varies
slightly
but
not
essentially
from
other
birds
it
has
a
feathered
tail
some
teeth
and
claws
it
is
probably
not
a
connecting
link
at
all
and
if
it
were
we
would
expect
a
million
fossils
of
connecting
links
all
these
nine
transmutations
are
devoid
of
a
single
sure
connecting
link
when
we
would
expect
millions
in
every
case
these
facts
prove
that
evolution
is
a
delusion
and
an
absurdity
ancestral
apes
and
monkeys
many
have
taught
that
man
was
descended
from
an
ape
or
monkey
evolutionists
ashamed
of
a
doctrine
so
repugnant
to
all
reason
and
so
revolting
to
mankind
vainly
imagine
they
can
escape
the
odium
of
such
a
view
by
declaring
that
man
is
not
descended
from
an
ape
or
monkey
but
that
all
the
primates
including
all
monkeys
apes
and
man
sprang
from
a
common
ancestor
of
this
alleged
ancestor
a
single
fossil
chapin
social
evolution
page
says
the
doctrine
of
the
descent
of
man
was
first
advanced
superficial
and
popular
writers
immediately
jumped
at
the
conclusion
that
naturalists
believed
that
man
was
descended
from
the
monkey
this
of
course
is
quite
absurd
as
man
obviously
could
not
be
descended
from
a
form
of
life
now
living
the
ape
and
the
monkey
family
together
with
man
are
probably
descended
from
some
generalized
form
long
since
perished
from
the
suppose
this
absurd
and
unsupported
guess
to
be
correct
then
the
gorillas
chimpanzees
gibbons
and
other
apes
the
baboons
and
other
monkeys
and
the
lemurs
and
man
were
brothers
and
sisters
or
otherwise
closely
related
and
all
were
descended
immediately
or
nearly
so
from
a
common
ancestor
than
where
is
the
comfort
or
gain
moreover
all
the
members
of
this
primate
family
must
have
for
ages
until
according
to
the
theory
they
became
distinct
species
therefore
the
ancestors
of
man
for
ages
must
have
been
descended
from
all
these
members
of
the
primate
family
and
are
thus
the
offspring
of
these
repulsive
brutes
and
the
blood
of
them
all
is
in
our
veins
in
attempting
to
rescue
us
from
the
ape
as
our
ancestor
they
have
shown
that
we
are
descendants
of
the
whole
monkey
family
and
every
species
of
ape
and
of
many
of
their
more
disreputable
relatives
also
great
is
evolution
it
certainly
would
be
impossible
for
one
single
pair
to
have
become
the
ancestors
of
the
human
race
without
mixing
and
interbreeding
with
their
kindred
primates
where
are
the
descendants
of
these
mongrel
breeds
part
monkey
and
part
man
we
would
expect
all
gradations
of
mixed
animals
from
monkey
to
man
or
three
millions
of
years
ago
an
enormous
family
of
monkeys
spread
over
europe
asia
and
all
related
many
our
ancestors
why
did
not
some
other
species
of
the
primates
equal
or
excel
man
or
advance
part
way
between
man
and
the
brute
why
are
they
not
now
becoming
human
it
is
plain
to
the
sincere
student
that
the
evolution
of
man
from
the
brute
is
only
the
product
of
the
imagination
of
those
who
wish
to
deny
special
creation
and
exclude
god
from
his
universe
the
slight
external
resemblance
between
man
and
the
ape
family
is
more
than
offset
by
structural
differences
which
deny
kinship
alfred
mccann
in
his
great
book
says
has
pairs
of
ribs
the
gibbon
and
chimpanzee
man
has
dorsal
vertebrae
the
chimpanzee
and
gorilla
the
gibbon
the
gorilla
has
massive
spines
on
the
cervical
vertebrae
above
the
and
like
the
other
quadrumana
animals
has
an
opposable
thumb
on
the
hind
foot
there
are
wide
differences
in
the
shape
of
the
skull
thorax
femur
and
even
the
liver
the
skeleton
of
the
brutes
is
much
more
massive
on
the
tips
of
the
fingers
and
thumbs
of
the
human
hand
are
lines
arranged
in
whorls
for
identification
in
monkeys
the
lines
are
parallel
on
the
finger
tips
but
whorls
on
the
palm
is
it
possible
that
man
and
such
brutes
came
from
the
same
parents
a
staggering
speculation
the
theory
that
all
plants
and
animals
have
descended
from
one
primordial
germ
is
staggering
to
the
mind
if
so
how
was
it
did
this
original
germ
split
in
two
like
some
disease
germs
one
of
them
the
beginning
of
plant
life
and
the
other
the
head
of
all
animal
life
or
did
vegetation
only
grow
from
this
first
germ
for
ages
and
then
some
of
it
turn
into
species
of
animals
as
if
the
guess
were
worthy
of
attention
some
are
ready
to
assert
that
early
vegetation
algae
turned
into
animals
did
plants
become
animals
somewhere
along
the
way
or
did
animals
somewhere
along
the
way
turn
into
plants
how
long
did
they
interbreed
before
the
gap
became
too
wide
where
are
the
descendants
of
the
union
between
plants
and
animals
if
animals
were
first
developed
from
this
first
germ
what
did
they
live
on
while
there
was
no
vegetation
what
folly
is
like
the
folly
of
the
evolutionist
who
claims
that
such
weird
speculation
is
science
great
gaps
between
the
principal
divisions
of
the
animal
world
are
fatal
to
this
speculation
which
rests
upon
nothing
but
the
wish
that
it
were
so
links
are
lacking
between
marine
and
amphibian
animals
reptiles
and
birds
reptiles
and
mammals
between
apes
and
man
of
course
we
would
find
fossils
of
millions
of
these
links
if
there
were
any
the
missing
links
are
necessary
to
the
scheme
is
there
one
chance
in
a
million
that
evolution
is
a
true
hypothesis
sex
can
the
evolutionist
explain
the
origin
of
sex
starting
with
one
germ
or
even
a
few
germs
reproduction
must
have
been
by
division
for
a
time
if
the
germ
that
became
the
head
of
all
plant
life
reproduced
by
division
when
did
it
begin
to
reproduce
by
seeds
it
is
still
more
difficult
to
explain
when
sex
life
began
in
animals
there
could
have
been
no
sex
life
at
first
and
perhaps
for
ages
they
can
not
tell
us
when
the
animals
by
chance
acquired
the
wonderful
adaptation
of
the
sexual
life
they
have
no
evidence
whatever
their
guess
is
no
better
than
that
of
others
it
passes
credulity
to
believe
that
the
sexual
life
with
all
its
marvelous
design
was
reached
by
the
invention
of
irrational
animals
when
man
with
all
his
powers
of
reason
invention
and
discovery
is
helpless
even
to
understand
the
great
wisdom
and
power
that
brought
it
about
can
blind
chance
or
aimless
effort
by
senseless
brutes
accomplish
more
than
the
amazing
design
of
an
infinitely
wise
and
powerful
god
how
was
the
progeny
of
mammals
kept
alive
during
the
ages
required
for
the
slow
development
of
the
mammae
man
hairless
and
tailless
how
did
man
become
a
hairless
animal
is
a
hard
question
for
evolutionists
any
scientific
theory
must
be
ready
to
give
an
account
of
all
phenomena
a
hypothesis
to
explain
the
origin
of
man
must
explain
all
the
facts
how
did
man
become
a
hairless
animal
explanation
is
too
puerile
for
any
one
professing
to
be
a
learned
scientist
to
give
he
says
that
the
females
preferred
males
with
the
least
hair
until
the
hairy
men
gradually
became
extinct
because
naturally
under
such
a
regime
the
hairy
men
would
die
off
and
finally
only
hairless
men
to
beget
progeny
would
survive
what
do
sensible
serious
students
think
of
this
explanation
if
we
try
to
take
this
explanation
seriously
we
find
that
the
science
of
phrenology
teaches
that
females
as
a
rule
inherit
the
traits
of
their
fathers
and
males
the
traits
of
their
mothers
hence
not
the
males
but
the
females
would
become
hairless
by
this
ridiculous
process
how
do
evolutionists
account
for
the
hair
left
on
the
head
and
other
parts
of
the
body
why
do
men
have
beard
while
women
and
children
do
not
if
the
hair
left
on
the
body
is
vestigial
why
is
there
no
hair
on
the
back
where
it
was
most
abundant
on
our
brute
ancestors
even
wallace
an
evolutionist
of
day
who
did
not
believe
in
the
evolution
of
man
calls
attention
to
the
fact
that
even
the
vestigial
hair
on
the
human
form
is
entirely
absent
from
the
back
while
it
is
very
abundant
and
useful
on
the
backs
of
the
monkey
family
if
there
was
any
good
reason
why
the
human
brute
should
lose
his
hair
why
for
the
same
reason
did
not
other
species
of
the
monkey
family
lose
their
hair
can
it
be
explained
by
natural
selection
was
the
naked
brute
better
fitted
to
survive
than
the
hairy
animal
did
man
survive
because
he
was
naked
and
the
hairy
brute
perish
evidently
not
for
the
hairy
brute
still
exists
in
great
abundance
the
best
way
to
get
rid
of
the
hair
of
the
brute
is
for
some
reconstructing
artist
like
mcgregor
to
take
it
off
in
a
picture
widely
copied
by
books
in
favor
of
evolution
photographed
from
his
the
pithecanthropus
the
neanderthal
man
and
the
man
are
represented
almost
without
hair
on
the
body
or
even
without
beard
only
the
neanderthal
man
has
a
tiny
charlie
chaplin
mustache
their
hair
had
not
been
combed
for
years
yet
we
could
not
detect
it
a
sympathetic
artist
can
make
a
suit
his
fancy
and
support
any
theory
if
we
are
descended
from
simian
stock
how
did
we
come
to
lose
our
tails
would
not
the
same
causes
if
any
cause
all
the
species
to
lose
their
tails
according
to
the
laws
of
biometry
ought
we
not
to
find
a
retrogression
of
sections
of
the
human
race
who
would
sport
simian
tails
and
be
clothed
with
simian
hair
or
could
natural
selection
explain
the
loss
of
the
tail
on
the
ground
that
all
the
monkeys
with
tails
died
off
while
the
tailless
ones
survived
and
developed
into
human
beings
in
that
case
a
tail
must
have
been
a
fatal
imperfection
hybrids
would
seem
to
be
most
available
means
of
producing
new
yet
the
sterility
of
hybrids
defeats
that
possibility
and
rebukes
the
untruthful
claim
of
the
formation
of
new
species
nature
with
sword
in
hand
decrees
the
death
of
hybrids
lest
they
might
produce
a
new
species
moses
wrote
the
rigid
unchanging
law
of
nature
when
he
said
that
every
living
creature
would
bring
forth
its
species
are
immutable
one
does
not
become
another
or
unite
with
another
to
produce
a
third
dogs
do
not
become
cats
nor
interbreed
to
produce
another
species
a
few
species
so
nearly
related
that
we
can
scarcely
tell
whether
they
are
species
or
varieties
as
the
jackass
and
the
mare
may
have
offspring
but
the
offspring
are
sterile
the
zebra
and
the
mare
may
produce
a
zebulon
which
is
likewise
sterile
and
so
with
the
offspring
of
other
groups
intermediate
between
species
and
varieties
a
human
being
and
ape
can
not
beget
an
showing
that
they
are
not
even
nearly
related
species
if
evolution
be
true
we
would
expect
a
frequent
interbreeding
and
interchanging
of
species
even
darwin
admitted
that
species
are
immutable
god
declared
it
in
his
word
and
stamps
it
indelibly
on
every
species
god
said
the
earth
bring
forth
the
living
creature
after
its
kind
cattle
and
creeping
thing
and
beast
of
the
earth
after
its
how
did
moses
know
this
great
truth
unless
he
was
told
by
inspiration
of
god
even
are
not
permanent
darwin
himself
says
plants
not
propagated
by
seed
are
of
little
importance
to
us
for
their
endurance
is
only
even
if
it
could
be
proven
that
species
like
varieties
are
formed
by
development
it
does
not
follow
that
genera
and
families
and
classes
are
so
developed
but
it
has
not
been
proved
that
a
single
species
has
been
added
by
development
much
less
orders
families
and
genera
evolution
must
account
for
every
division
and
to
plant
and
animal
life
darwin
answers
the
objection
to
the
sterility
of
hybrids
by
saying
do
not
why
he
says
the
case
of
distinct
species
the
sexual
elements
should
so
generally
have
become
more
or
less
modified
leading
to
their
mutual
infertility
we
do
not
but
god
knows
the
instinct
of
animals
the
instinct
of
animals
is
not
due
to
their
own
intelligence
it
is
unerring
unchangeable
without
improvement
or
deterioration
it
implies
knowledge
and
wisdom
of
the
highest
order
it
is
beyond
the
wisdom
of
man
it
comes
direct
from
god
it
is
not
learned
nor
gained
by
experience
it
is
found
in
many
species
of
animals
and
even
in
a
child
until
knowledge
and
reason
make
it
unnecessary
one
of
the
most
familiar
illustrations
is
the
instinct
of
the
honey
bee
it
builds
its
cells
in
exact
geometric
form
and
we
compute
by
calculus
that
the
form
it
uses
produces
the
greatest
capacity
in
proportion
to
the
amount
of
material
used
who
taught
the
bee
to
build
its
cell
displaying
greater
knowledge
than
that
of
many
a
college
graduate
darwin
says
origin
of
species
can
be
clearly
shown
that
the
most
wonderful
instincts
with
which
we
are
acquainted
namely
those
of
the
honey
bee
could
not
possibly
have
been
acquired
by
we
quote
from
calculus
know
that
the
shape
of
a
bee
cell
is
hexagonal
giving
a
certain
capacity
for
honey
with
the
greatest
possible
economy
of
this
is
demonstrated
by
the
solution
of
a
problem
in
this
same
calculus
darwin
again
says
origin
of
species
vol
i
hear
from
mathematicians
that
bees
have
practically
solved
a
recondite
problem
and
have
made
their
cells
of
the
proper
shape
to
hold
the
greatest
possible
amount
of
honey
with
the
least
possible
consumption
of
precious
wax
in
their
construction
it
has
been
remarked
that
a
skilful
workman
with
fitting
tools
and
measures
would
find
it
very
difficult
to
make
cells
of
wax
of
the
true
form
though
this
is
effected
by
a
crowd
of
bees
working
in
a
dark
room
each
cell
as
is
well
known
is
a
hexagonal
prism
with
the
basal
edges
of
its
six
sides
beveled
so
as
to
join
an
inverted
pyramid
of
three
rhombs
these
rhombs
have
certain
angles
and
the
three
which
form
the
pyramidal
base
of
a
single
cell
on
one
side
of
the
comb
enter
into
the
composition
of
the
bases
of
the
three
adjoining
cells
on
the
opposite
can
any
one
suggest
an
improvement
or
show
an
imperfection
if
this
intelligence
is
the
own
which
is
far
superior
to
that
of
the
ape
why
did
not
the
bee
develop
a
human
brain
yet
in
spite
of
admission
he
labors
hard
to
show
that
is
no
real
difficulty
under
changing
conditions
of
life
in
natural
selection
accumulating
to
any
extent
slight
modifications
of
instinct
which
are
in
any
way
how
could
the
working
bee
conserve
the
gains
accumulated
by
experience
or
habit
the
drone
is
the
father
and
the
queen
is
the
mother
of
the
sterile
female
working
bee
neither
parent
knows
how
to
build
a
cell
how
could
they
transmit
their
knowledge
or
their
habits
to
the
working
bee
every
new
swarm
of
bees
would
not
know
how
to
build
their
cells
there
is
no
improvement
from
generation
to
generation
even
if
instinct
in
other
animals
could
be
accounted
for
evolution
can
not
account
for
the
instinct
of
the
working
bees
since
they
are
not
descendants
of
other
working
bees
from
which
they
might
inherit
habits
or
instinct
is
not
the
instinct
of
the
bee
the
intelligence
of
god
disproving
the
heresy
of
an
absentee
god
here
again
we
get
a
glimpse
of
the
unerring
wisdom
of
god
the
immoveable
oyster
the
bee
alive
with
divine
intelligence
and
the
sterile
progeny
of
the
jackass
are
enough
to
upset
the
whole
theory
of
evolution
special
creation
gen
i
evolution
can
not
be
true
because
it
contradicts
the
inspired
word
of
god
we
do
not
speak
arbitrarily
and
say
without
proof
that
whatever
contradicts
the
revealed
word
of
god
can
not
be
true
although
such
an
attitude
could
be
easily
defended
disregarding
all
the
many
other
cogent
and
legitimate
arguments
in
support
of
a
divine
revelation
we
will
appeal
to
the
remarkable
harmony
between
the
story
of
creation
in
genesis
and
the
modern
sciences
this
could
not
be
if
god
had
not
revealed
to
moses
the
story
of
creation
moses
personally
knew
nothing
revealed
by
the
sciences
of
today
and
the
man
of
that
day
who
would
invent
the
story
of
creation
would
be
sure
to
conflict
with
one
or
more
of
the
following
modern
sciences
geology
astronomy
zoology
biology
geography
chemistry
physics
anatomy
philology
archaeology
history
ethics
religion
etc
there
is
not
one
chance
in
a
million
that
a
writer
of
a
fictitious
account
would
not
have
run
amuck
among
many
of
these
sciences
if
like
moses
he
had
no
personal
knowledge
of
them
although
the
babylonian
account
may
have
had
some
foundation
in
fact
from
a
tradition
of
a
prior
revelation
it
plainly
bears
the
marks
of
error
babylonian
stories
of
creation
are
full
of
grotesque
and
polytheistic
ideas
while
those
of
the
bible
speak
only
of
the
one
living
and
true
things
the
babylonian
legend
says
produced
at
the
first
from
gods
came
into
being
in
long
succession
but
at
length
enmity
arose
between
them
and
tiamat
who
created
monsters
to
oppose
them
merodach
a
solar
deity
vanquished
tiamat
cut
her
body
in
two
and
with
of
it
made
a
firmament
supporting
the
upper
waters
in
the
sky
the
babylonian
gods
like
even
those
of
the
classics
were
criminals
fit
only
for
prison
or
death
alfred
russell
wallace
who
with
darwin
devised
the
evolution
theory
says
must
have
been
three
interpositions
of
a
divine
and
supernatural
power
to
account
for
things
as
they
are
agreement
of
science
with
genesis
is
very
there
is
a
gulf
between
matter
and
nothing
one
between
life
and
the
and
a
third
between
man
and
the
lower
creation
and
science
can
not
bridge
them
this
between
science
and
genesis
i
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
at
least
great
events
are
enumerated
in
the
same
order
as
claimed
by
modern
science
the
earth
was

was

created
man
was
created
the
chance
of
guessing
the
exact
order
of
these
great
events
is
ascertained
by
the
law
of
product
of
the
numbers
from
to
which
is
therefore
moses
had
one
chance
out
of
to
guess
the
correct
order
of
these
great
events
as
revealed
both
by
science
and
revelation
if
for
example
the
first
letters
of
the
alphabet
were
arranged
in
some
unknown
miscellaneous
order
any
one
would
have
but
one
chance
out
of
to
guess
the
order
if
moses
did
not
have
the
order
revealed
to
him
he
never
could
have
guessed
it
therefore
he
was
inspired
and
was
told
the
order
this
mathematical
demonstration
annihilates
the
contradicting
theory
of
evolution
at
once
it
proves
that
the
account
was
divinely
inspired
and
man
came
by
special
creation
and
not
by
evolution
the
fact
that
the
language
of
genesis
is
in
remarkable
harmony
with
all
proven
modern
scientific
theories
and
manifestly
confirmed
by
them
is
a
proof
in
favor
of
the
creation
story
decisive
and
final
this
harmony
is
manifest
whether
the
heb
day
be
taken
to
mean
a
long
period
as
advocated
by
many
biblical
scholars
or
a
literal
day
of
hours
followed
it
may
be
by
years
or
ages
of
continuance
of
the
work
before
the
next
work
of
hours
began
believing
that
this
interpretation
does
no
violence
to
the
text
and
that
it
is
especially
in
harmony
with
the
statements
in
the
fourth
commandment
and
elsewhere
in
the
bible
it
is
here
briefly
presented
as
one
interpretation
showing
the
marvelous
harmony
between
revelation
and
the
proven
and
even
the
generally
accepted
scientific
theories
the
stately
procession
of
events
is
the
same
no
matter
which
interpretation
is
accepted
and
doubtless
will
remain
even
if
both
must
yield
to
another
and
better
interpretation
this
majestic
divine
order
in
harmony
with
both
science
and
revelation
removes
all
doubt
of
special
creation
another
interpretation
advocated
by
many
scholars
is
that
all
geologic
ages
may
have
intervened
during
the
time

between
the
and

of

a

it
would
seem
a
probable
interpretation
of
the
inspired

would
it

a

a

a

can

it

it

the

of

the
wonderful

by

whether
by

the
napierian
system
with
a

of
a
decimal
that
never

are
possible
and
reliable
only
because
god
made
them
so
think
what
great
intelligence
is
required
by
the
napierian

to
raise
a
decimal
that
never
terminates
to
a
decimal
power
that

to
produce

integral
number
yet
god
has
computed

every
table
of

every
other
mathematical
table

how
difficult
thus
we
have
positive
proof
of
the
presence
everywhere
of
a
great
intelligent
being

we
catch
a
glimpse
of
that
mind
that

the

the

is
that
god
created
all

in
a
similar
way
if
it
was

and
best
to
bring

the
great
science

fix
all
physical

why
should
he
consume

evolution

all
out
of

methods
of

gravitation

no

no

the

of

estimate
our

the

perfect

complete
laws
prevail
touching
light
heat

gravitation
etc
god
makes
no
mistakes
and
no
evolution
is
needed
does
not
this
furnish
a
presumption
that
god
could
and
did
create
man
complete
and
full
grown
with
a
wonderful
body
and
a
soul
in
his
own
image
in
this
discussion
we
have
spoken
of
the
of

after
common
usage
but
laws
are
only
a
record
of
acts
an
unchangeable
god
makes
unchangeable
laws
there
is
a
rigid
fixity
written
over
the
face
of
nature
every
law
and
principle
is
complete
and
perfect
and
finished
and
there
is
no
room
for
evolution
matter
did
not
create
itself
nor
evolute
nor

it
must
have
been
created
instantaneously
by
the

of

in

nebulous

profess

were
all
species
of
animals
and
plants
evolved
from

but
that
even

itself
was
evolved
out
of
nothing
this
theory

been
innumerable
transitional
forms
in

no
convincing
evidence
of
these
missing
links
exists
natural
selection
can
not
account
for
the
instinct
of
animals
such
as
that

bee
has
practically
anticipated
the
discoveries
of
profound
the
offspring
of
such
nearly
related
species
as
can
be

are
sterile
showing
that
nature
discourages
and
in
no
wise
encourages
the
formation
of
new
species
the
changes
resulting
from
the
use
and
disuse
of
organs
are
not
inherited
since
darwinism
eliminates
design
it
is
only
the
exploded
ancient
heathen
doctrine
of
chance
variation
is
so
slight
as
to
be
imperceptible
and
therefore
can
not
account
for
the
of
the
if
the

progressive
changes
do
not
occur
generally
if
not
universally
in
the
numbers
of
the

species
in

period
no
new
species
can
arise
such
general
changes
do
not
occur
natural
selection
could
not
make
use
of
initial
slight
changes
would
be
the
advantage
of
the
first
few
hairs
of

mammal
or
the

steps

feathers
in

bird
when
these
creatures
were
beginning
to
diverge
from
their
reptilian
ancestors
even
if
darwinism
should
explain
the
of
the
fittest
it
does
not
explain
the
of
the
fittest
which
is
far
more
important
darwin
says
am
convinced
that
natural
selection
has
been
the
most
important
but
not
the
exclusive
means
of
many
scientists
think
it
of
very
little
importance
and
that
it
is
not
true
fluctuating
variations
of
darwinism
are
or
plus
and
minus
variations
whereas
the
differences
between
species
are
growth
and
development
in
one
species
does
not
produce
a
new

such
adverse
opinions

and
the

bone
is
that

is
it
likely
that

belonged

even
if
they
did
is
it
likely
that
these
bones
would
be
preserved
in
the
sand
years
or
even
years
according
to
a
later
estimate
we
know
that
petrified
skeletons
encased
in

may
be
millions
of

old
but
where
are
the
unpetrified
skeletons
of

who
lived

to
accumulate
over

in
a
few
centuries
if

of

accumulated

elsewhere
we
have
shown
that
an

a
cranium
of
normal
capacity
must
have
lived
at
least
years
ago
third
the
period
of
animal
existence
or
even
years
ago
if
we
accept
a
later
claim
that
life
has
existed
years
it
is
absolutely
impossible
that
a
normal
creature
of
the
alleged
mental
capacity
could
have
lived
years
ago
much
less
according
to
a
later
estimate
cutting
in
two
the
first
one
but
the
quickest
way
to
disprove
these
wild
guesses
is
to
check
them
up
by
a
mathematical
test
if
these
bones
are
normal
such
an
could
not

the

assigned

they

they
prove

upon
such
a
flimsy

accept
a
theory
unsupported

irreconcilable

which
takes
away

we
count

up
the
hypothesis
that
some
of

belonged
to
who
lived
about
years
ago
we
are
told
that
in
many
caverns
there
are
paintings
of
animals
some
of
which
are
extinct
proving
that
the
artists
were
of
advancing
intellect
living
in
that
day
these

are
rude
and
inexact
and
the
resemblance
to
extinct
animals
rather
fanciful
if
the
writer
were
to
try
to
draw
a
picture
of
a
horse
on
the
stone
walls
of
a
dark
cavern
with
no
light
it
would
be
just
as
likely
to
resemble
an
extinct
animal
or
possibly
an
animal
that
never
did
live
and
never
will
many
of
the
paintings
are
found
in
the
depths
of
unlit
caverns
often
difficult
of
access
how
could
they
paint
any
picture
in
the
dark
when
even
fire
was
unknown
and
the
torch
and
had
not
yet
been
invented
and
how
could
they
make
a
ladder
or
erect
scaffolding
of
any
sort
in
that
rude
age
before
there
were
inventions
of
any
kind
yet
they
tell
us
that
the
frescoes
on
the
ceiling
of
the
dark
cavern
of
altamira
spain
were
made
to
years
ago
when
fire
was
unknown

they
ask
us
to
believe
that
several
colors
are
used
brown
red
black
yellow
and
white
and
that
these
drawings
and
colors
have
remained
undisturbed
and
unchanged
through
these
long
ages
is
it
easier
to
believe
this
than
to
believe
that
these
drawings
were
made
by
modern
man
using
modern
inventions
a
theory
left
to
such
support
must
be
in
argument
indeed
vestigial
organs
the
claim
is
made
that
the
rudimentary
organs
in
the
human
body
such
as
the
appendix
are
the
remnants
of
more
complete
organs
inherited
from
our
animal
ancestors
it
is
a
strange
argument
that
a
once
complete
and
useful
organ
in
our
alleged
animal
ancestors
when
it
becomes
atrophied
in
man
causes
such
an
improvement
and
advance
as
to
cause
man
to
survive
when
his
ancestors
with
more
perfect
organs
became
extinct
man
with
less
perfect
organs
became
the
dominant
species
if
the
perfect
organ
were
better
than
the
rudimentary
organ
how
can
man
be
the
of
the
if
rudimentary
organs
are
a
proof
of
descent
from
animals
with
more
extensive
if
not
more
perfect
organs
then
both
man
and
monkeys
must
be
descended
from
the
rat
which
has
the
longest
proportionate
appendix
of
all
if
unused
muscles
speak
of
our
ancestry
the
horse
has
the
strongest
claim
to
be
our
ancestor
but
many
organs
such
as
thyroid
gland
the
thymus
gland
and
the
pineal
gland
formerly
classified
as
rudimentary
organs
are
found
to
be
very
useful
and
necessary
physicians
have
found
the
appendix
very
useful
in
preventing
constipation
which
its
removal
usually
increases
if
we
only
knew
enough
we
would
no
doubt
discover
a
beneficial
use
for
all
the
vestigial
organs
our
ignorance
is
no
argument
against
the
wisdom
of
their
creation
the
claim
that
human
hair
is
vestigial
is
spoiled
by
the
fact
that
there
is
none
on
the
back
where
most
abundant
on
simians
serology
or
blood
tests
they
tell
us
that
the
blood
of
a
dog
injected
into
the
veins
of
a
horse
will
kill
the
horse
whereas
the
blood
of
a
man
injected
into
the
veins
of
an
ape
results
in
very
feeble
reaction
which
proves
that
the
dog
and
the
horse
they
say
are
not
related
by
blood
while
the
man
and
the
ape
are
so
related
but
a
distinguished
authority
says
blood
of
the
dog
is
poisonous
to
other
animals
whilst
on
the
other
hand
the
blood
and
the
blood
serum
of
the
and
have
generally
little
effect
on
other
animals
on
it
is
for
this
reason
that
these
animals
and
particularly
the
horse
are
used
in
preparation
of
the
serums
employed
in
it
is
also
stated
as
a
fact
that
milk
more
nearly
resembles
human
milk
than
that
of
any
other
animal
save
the
ass
a
nearly
related
the
mare
let
us
hope
not
to
us
because
of
this
resemblance
it
is
reported
by
hutchinson
that
of
the
large
dairy
companies
in
england
now
keeps
a
stock
of
milch
asses
for
the
purpose
of
supplying
milk
for
delicate
human
these
facts
would
prove
the
horse
and
the
ass
a
nearer
relative
than
the
ape
since
serums
are
not
made
from
the
blood
of
the
ape
we
prefer
the
innocent
sheep
to
the
ape
as
our
near
relative
and
will
allow
the
evolutionists
to
claim
the
goat
keen
prof

of

in

says
again
you
perceive
such
identity
of
function
that
the
thyroid
gland
of
animals
when
given
as
a
remedy
to
man
performs
precisely
the
same
function
as
the
human
thyroid
moreover
it
is
not
the
thyroid
gland
from
the
anthropoid
apes
that
is
used
as
a
remedy
but
that
from
the
more
lowly
again
the
force
of
argument
goes
to
prove
so
far
as
it
has
any
weight
that
we
have
a
nearer
kinship
to
the

than
the

says
must
not
be
supposed
that
there
is
any
exact
mathematical
ratio
between
the
degrees

indicated
by
the

those
which
are

by

could
hardly
be
maintained
that
an
ostrich
and
a

are
more
nearly

that
would
be
the
inference

presented
evidence
to
show
that
the

reaction
does
not
in

manner
indicate
how
closely
any
two
animals
are

that

based
on

of

is
not
trustworthy

of

cases
transfusions
of

positive
reactions
we

not

repeated
in
the
early
stages
of
embryonic
life
scott
in
the
of
evolution
says
years
ago
the
recapitulation
theory
was
well
nigh
universally
accepted
nowadays
it
is
very
seriously
questioned
and
by
some
high
authorities
is
altogether
it
is
hard
to
see
why
the
history
of
the
species
should
be
repeated
by
the
embryo
it
is
difficult
to
crowd
the
history
of
ages
into
a
few
days
or
weeks
it
must
be
enormously
abbreviated
it
is
a
physical
impossibility
changes
caused
by
many
environments
must
take
place
in
the
same
environment
contradicting
the
theory
of
evolution
so
many
exceptions
must
be
made
that
there
can
be
no
universal
law
such
general
similarity
as
we
find
in
embryonic
life
may
be
accounted
for
on
the
ground
that
the
creator
used
one
general
plan
with
unlimited
variation
never
repeating
himself
so
as
to
make
two
faces
or
two
leaves
or
two
grains
of
sand
exactly
alike
is
an
ancient
manuscript
with
many
of
the
sheets
lost
others
displaced
and
with
spurious
passages
interpolated
by
a
later
it
is
hard
to
construct
a
syllogism
showing
the
force
of
the
argument
from
embryology
try
it
various
other
evolution
arguments
are
answered
in
part
one
and
completely
refuted
by
scientific
facts
no
one
has
yet
noted
an
error
nor
answered
an
argument
if
all
students
teachers
ministers
had
this
book
pp
evolutionists
could
no
longer
conceal
the
arguments
nor
answer
them
by
ridicule
or
abuse
part
three
the
soul
the
origin
of
the
soul
evolution
fails
to
account
for
the
origin
of
the
body
of
man
still
more
emphatically
does
it
fail
to
account
for
the
origin
of
the
soul
or
spiritual
part
of
man
this
is
part
of
the
stupendous
task
of
evolution
its
advocates
give
it
little
or
no
attention
we
are
not
surprised
if
they
show
the
evolution
of
the
human
body
or
even
they
can
never
account
for
the
origin
of
the
soul
save
by
creation
of
almighty
god
we
can
not
release
evolutionists
upon
the
plea
that
they
can
not
account
for
the
faculties
and
spiritual
endowments
of
man
this
is
a
confession
of
complete
failure
though
invisible
to
the
eye
or
the
microscope
they
are
positive
realities
they
can
not
be
dismissed
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
or
a
gesture
of
contempt
we
have
a
right
to
demand
an
explanation
for
every
phenomenon
connected
with
the
body
or
soul
of
man
the
task
may
be
heavy
and
even
impossible
yet
every
hypothesis
must
bear
every
test
or
confess
failure
they
have
undertaken
to
propose
a
scheme
that
will
account
for
the
origin
of
man
as
he
is
soul
and
body
and
if
they
fail
the
hypothesis
fails
how
do
we
account
for
the
existence
of
each
individual
soul
it
can
not
be
the
product
of
the
arrangement
of
the
material
of
the
brain
as
the
materialists
do
vainly
teach
it
can
not
be
the
product
of
evolution
nor
a
growth
from
the
father
or
mother
the
soul
is
not
transmitted
to
be
modified
or
changed
it
is
indivisible
the
soul
of
the
child
is
not
a
part
of
the
soul
of
either
parent
the
parents
suffer
no
mental
loss
from
the
new
soul
it
must
be
created
before
it
can
grow
god
creates
each
soul
without
doubt
and
so
god
created
the
souls
of
adam
and
eve
if
creation
is
possible
now
it
was
possible
at
the
beginning
of
the
race
if
god
creates
the
soul
now
analogy
teaches
strongly
the
creation
of
the
souls
of
adam
and
eve
if
evolution
be
true
there
was
no
creation
in
the
past
and
is
none
now
this
is
contradicted
by
the
facts
every
day
and
every
hour
personality
an
evolutionist
writes
do
not
undertake
to
account
for
we
reply
is
a
part
of
your
problem
you
have
undertaken
to
solve
the
riddle
of
the
universe
by
excluding
all
evidence
of
an
existing
and
active
god
and
we
can
not
release
you
because
a
feature
of
the
problem
may
be
unusually
difficult
or
embarrassing
or
even
fatal
to
your
theory
it
is
a
fight
to
the
death
in
the
interest
of
truth
and
we
purpose
to
use
every
weapon
of
science
against
a
theory
so
unscientific
so
improbable
so
far
reaching
and
so
baneful
in
its
effects
it
takes
faith
hope
and
comfort
from
the
heart
of
the
christian
destroys
belief
in
god
and
sends
multitudes
to
the
lost
personality
is
consciousness
of
individuality
when
did
personality
begin
when
did
any
members
of
the
species
become
conscious
of
personality
when
did
they
begin
to
realize
and
to
say
in
thought
am
a
living
what
animals
are
conscious
of
personality
any
of
our
cousins
of
the
monkey
tribe
is
the
horse
conscious
of
personality
or
the
ox
the
cat
or
the
dog
if
so
does
the
skunk
have
personality
the
mouse
the
flea
the
worm
the
tadpole
the
microscopic
animal
if
so
do
our
other
cousins
have
personality
trees
the
vines
the
flowers
the
thorn
and
the
brier
the
cactus
and
the
thistle
and
the
microscopic
disease
germs
if
so
when
did
personality
begin
with
the
first
primordial
germ
if
so
were
there
two
personalities
when
the
germ
split
in
two
and
became
two
animal
and
plant
you
can
not
split
a
man
up
into
two
parts
with
a
personality
to
each
part
personality
is
indivisible
it
is
a
consciousness
of
that
indivisibility
if
personality
began
anywhere
along
the
line
where
when
and
how
did
it
originate
was
it
spontaneous
or
by
chance
or
was
it
beyond
all
question
it
was
the
gift
of
an
and
creator
and
in
no
sense
the
product
of
evolution
god
made
man
a
living
soul
but
if
no
plant
or
animal
ever
had
personality
when
did
man
first
become
conscious
of
his
individuality
there
is
no
evidence
of
course
but
the
evolutionist
must
produce
it
or
admit
failure
the
evolutionist
is
short
on
evidence
but
long
on
guesses
that
miss
the
mark
if
all
animals
and
plants
came
from
one
germ
why
do
animals
have
the
senses
sight
taste
touch
smell
and
hearing
while
plants
are
utterly
devoid
of
them
they
had
a
nearly
equal
chance
in
the
race
why
the
great
difference
intellect
emotions
and
will
the
activity
and
energy
of
the
soul
are
shown
in
the
intellect
the
emotions
and
the
will
what
evidence
of
these
do
we
find
in
the
animal
world
do
we
find
intellect
in
the
lobster
emotions
in
a
worm
or
will
in
an
oyster
whence
came
these
elements
of
spiritual
strength
if
developed
by
evolution
where
when
and
how
have
the
most
advanced
species
of
animals
an
intellect
do
they
have
the
emotions
of
love
hate
envy
pity
remorse
or
sympathy
has
a
worm
envy
a
flea
hate
a
cat
pity
a
hog
remorse
or
a
horse
sympathy
if
these
existed
in
man
when
where
and
how
did
they
begin
no
one
can
answer
because
there
is
not
a
trace
of
proof
that
they
ever
existed
will
natural
selection
explain
the
development
of
the
mental
faculties
was
art
developed
because
those
who
lacked
it
perished
do
we
account
for
the
musical
faculty
because
those
who
could
not
sing
perished
some
still
live
who
ought
to
be
dead
do
we
account
for
humor
because
they
perished
who
could
not
crack
a
joke
will
all
eventually
perish
but
the
irish
who
will
survive
by
their
wit
is
anything
mentioned
in
science
quite
so
ridiculous
as
natural
selection
not
an
animal
has
a
trace
of
wit
or
humor
or
pathos
not
an
animal
has
ever
laughed
or
spoken
or
sung
the
silence
of
the
ages
disproves
evolution
abstract
reason
when
did
reason
begin
do
we
find
it
in
any
species
of
plant
or
animal
life
save
man
the
highest
order
of
animals
can
not
reason
enough
to
start
a
fire
or
replenish
one
a
dog
or
a
cat
or
even
a
monkey
will
enjoy
the
warmth
from
a
fire
but
will
not
replenish
it
although
they
may
have
seen
it
done
many
times
animals
may
be
taught
many
interesting
tricks
many
can
imitate
well
but
they
do
not
have
the
power
of
reflection
or
abstract
reason
they
live
for
the
present
they
have
no
plans
for
tomorrow
purpose
in
life
they
can
not
come
to
new
conclusions
they
can
not
add
or
subtract
multiply
or
divide
they
can
not
even
count
some
animals
can
solve
very
intricate
problems
by
instinct
but
instinct
is
the
intelligence
of
god
and
never
could
have
come
by
evolution
if
reason
came
not
from
god
but
from
evolution
should
we
not
expect
it
well
developed
in
evolutionary
man
since
for
the
last
years
he
must
have
been
to
per
cent
normal
if
we
grant
the
estimate
of
years
he
would
have
been
normal
for
the
last
years
would
we
not
expect
in
that
time
a
world
of
inventions
and
discoveries
even
surpassing
those
of
the
last
years
the
chinese
claim
a
multitude
of
inventions
and
a
race
so
nearly
normal
as
ought
to
have
invented
language
writing
printing
the
telegraph
phonograph
the
wireless
the
radio
television
and
even
greater
wonders
than
in
our
age
there
is
no
trace
of
intelligence
in
man
in
all
the
years
prior
to
adam
we
should
have
many
works
excelling
iliad
aeneid
and
paradise
lost
we
have
no
trace
of
a
road
or
a
bridge
or
a
monument
like
the
pyramids
that
no
race
of
intelligent
creatures
ever
lived
prior
to
adam
is
proven
by
lack
of
affirmative
evidence
if
it
be
true
as
romanes
declared
that
the
power
of
abstract
reason
in
all
the
species
was
only
equal
to
that
of
a
child
months
old
then
each
species
would
possess
less
than
one
millionth
of
that
conscience
if
the
origin
of
the
mental
faculties
can
not
be
accounted
for
by
evolution
much
less
can
the
moral
faculty
the
religious
nature
and
spirituality
be
accounted
for
the
most
confirmed
evolutionist
will
not
claim
that
the
tree
or
the
vine
or
the
rose
or
perhaps
any
animal
has
a
conscience
if
however
conscience
is
a
growth
or
development
why
should
it
not
exist
in
some
measure
in
both
the
animal
and
the
vegetable
kingdoms
has
any
brute
any
idea
of
right
or
wrong
has
a
hog
any
idea
of
right
or
wrong
of
justice
or
injustice
what
animal
has
ever
shown
regret
for
a
wrong
or
approval
of
right
in
others
if
conscience
is
a
development
within
the
reach
of
every
species
many
of
the
million
or
more
no
doubt
would
have
shown
some
conscience
long
ago
but
if
man
developed
conscience
why
have
not
our
near
relatives
of
the
monkey
family
developed
a
conscience
they
had
the
same
chance
as
man
why
should
man
have
a
conscience
and
monkeys
none
why
is
there
no
trace
of
conscience
in
the
animal
or
vegetable
kingdom
because
it
is
the
gift
of
god
what
sign
of
regret
repentance
or
remorse
do
we
find
in
the
cat
or
the
dog
the
rat
or
the
hog
if
a
bull
gores
a
sheep
to
death
does
he
express
regret
is
a
horse
sorry
if
he
crushes
to
death
a
child
or
a
chicken
under
his
hoof
can
any
animal
be
sorry
for
stealing
food
from
another
will
it
take
any
steps
to
undo
the
wrong
man
according
to
evolution
is
a
creature
of
environment
he
is
a
victim
of
brute
impulse
he
has
no
conscience
no
free
will
he
can
commit
no
crime
killing
is
not
murder
it
is
not
sin
man
can
not
be
responsible
without
conscience
a
victim
of
circumstances
rushed
on
into
crime
sin
and
injustice
responsible
to
no
god
the
heart
sickens
at
the
brightest
picture
evolution
can
paint
the
difficulty
of
showing
the
evolution
of
the
body
is
insuperable
but
the
evolution
of
the
soul
with
all
its
mental
moral
and
spiritual
equipment
is
an
absolute
impossibility
small
wonder
that
evolutionists
are
unwilling
to
discuss
the
origin
of
the
soul
spirituality
does
any
plant
or
animal
worship
god
how
much
theology
does
a
cow
know
what
does
the
horse
think
about
god
what
animal
lives
with
an
anxious
desire
to
please
god
how
many
are
desirous
of
obeying
god
how
many
species
trust
him
how
many
love
him
how
many
pray
to
him
how
many
praise
him
for
his
goodness
evidently
no
animal
knows
anything
about
god
or
ever
thinks
of
worshiping
him
man
alone
worships
god
when
did
he
begin
the
idea
of
god
seems
to
be
in
the
hearts
of
all
except
the
dupes
of
evolution
and
the
bolshevists
of
russia
the
great
problem
to
explain
is
how
the
worship
of
god
began
and
why
man
alone
now
worships
him
personality
reason
intellect
emotions
will
conscience
spirituality
and
all
the
faculties
and
equipment
of
the
soul
are
naturally
and
easily
explained
upon
the
basis
of
creation
but
evolution
can
not
account
for
them
at
all
about
years
ago
we
are
told
man
and
the
monkey
family
were
children
of
the
same
parents
these
children
headed
species
with
an
even
start
yet
man
alone
developed
personality
consciousness
intelligence
and
all
the
equipment
of
the
soul
all
the
others
remained
stationary
this
is
incredible
it
is
inconsistent
with
mathematical
probability
is
it
likely
that
one
species
and
one
alone
out
of
a
million
with
similar
environments
would
reach
these
high
mental
and
spiritual
attainments
no
created
man
in
his
own
image
in
the
image
of
god
created
he
him
this
declaration
explains
all
the
difficulties
which
are
insuperable
to
the
evolutionist
the
day
that
god
created
man
in
the
likeness
of
god
made
he
this
likeness
was
not
a
physical
likeness
as
a
learned
university
professor
asserted
but
a
likeness
in
righteousness
and
no
animal
is
made
in
the
image
of
god
there
is
not
the
trace
of
a
soul
in
all
animal
creation
how
could
the
soul
of
man
develop
from
nothing
god
is
still
creating
new
creatures
in
christ
jesus
in
righteousness
and
true
holiness
which
can
not
come
by
evolution
for
sinful
creatures
can
only
grow
in
sinfulness
until
the
creative
power
of
god
makes
them
new
creatures
as
the
following
study
in
eugenics
will
show
elizabeth
tuttle
the
grandmother
of
jonathan
edwards
the
eminent
scholar
and
divine
was
according
to
walter
a
of
great
beauty
of
tall
and
commanding
appearance
striking
carriage
of
strong
extreme
intellectual
vigor
and
mental
grasp
akin
to
rapacity
but
an
extraordinary
deficiency
in
moral
sense
she
was
divorced
from
her
husband
on
the
ground
of
adultery
and
immoralities
the
evil
trait
was
in
the
blood
for
one
of
her
sisters
murdered
her
own
son
and
a
brother
murdered
his
own
sister
as
richard
edwards
his
grandfather
had
sons
and
daughter
by
a
second
wife
but
none
of
their
numerous
progeny
rose
above
mediocrity
and
their
descendants
gained
no
abiding
reputation
jonathan
edwards
must
have
owed
his
remarkable
mental
qualities
largely
to
his
grandmother
rather
than
his
grandfather
he
was
evidently
a
new
creation
in
christ
jesus
and
was
cured
by
grace
of
all
inherited
immoralities
so
that
he
became
the
ancestor
of
one
of
the
most
remarkable
families
in
the
history
of
the
world
as
follows
edwards
was
born
in
he
was
strong
in
character
mentally
vigorous
and
fearlessly
loyal
to
duty
in
of
the
descendants
of
jonathan
edwards
had
been
located
and
the
following
information
in
regard
to
them
had
been
gathered
college
presidents
college
professors
doctors
clergymen
missionaries
officers
in
the
army

eminent

united

several

the
claim
is
also
made
that
if
not
every
department
of
social
progress
and
of
public
weal
has
felt
the
impulse
of
this

founded
by
a
shiftless

born
in

in

that

there

can
not

for

tends
to
destroy

the

the

in

of

has
been
well
nigh
universal
in
all
ages
and
among

nations
and
is
taught
by

religions
without
it
life
and
death
are
insolvable
mysteries
a
doctrine
so
universal
so
well
established
by
reason
ought
not
to
be
set
aside
without
the
most
convincing
reasons
and
the
most
compelling
evidence
either
this
universal
belief
is
due
to
revelation
or
the
abundance
of

to

both

science

can

not

the

evolution
crushes
out
of
the
heart
the
hope
of
immortality
and
makes
man
but
an
improved
brute
while
jesus
christ
brought
life
and
immortality
to
light
through
the
if
evolution
be
true
when
did
man
become
immortal
at
what
period
did
he
cease
to
be
a
brute
and
become
an
immortal
soul
was
it
before
the
days
of
the
pithecanthropus
the
piltdown
fraud
the
heidelberg
man
or
the
neanderthal
man
the
change
was
ever
so
slow
and
gradual
could
the
parents
anywhere
along
the
line
be
mere
brutes
and
the
children
immortal
human
beings
would
it
not
be
impossible
to
draw
the
line
is
it
not
evident
that
the
could
never
grow
into
immortality
or
into
the
image
of
an
infinitely
great
and
glorious
god
if
evolutionists
give
us
any
convincing
evidence
that
the
body
of
man
developed
from
the
brute
they
can
not
prove
that
the
soul
grew
from
nothing
to
the
high
mental
moral
and
spiritual
attainments
into
the
very
image
of
god
and
by
its
own
efforts
become
as
immortal
as
god
himself
after
all
did
any
theory
as
ridiculously
untrue
as
evolution
ever
masquerade
as
science
or
ask
to
be
accepted
by
thoughtful
men
has
it
as
much
to
support
it
as
the
false
sciences
of
alchemy
and
astrology
the
brute
origin
of
man
infidelity
agnosticism
modernism
atheism
and
bolshevism
are
in
harmony
and
cooperate
in
robbing
man
of
heaven
and
the
hope
of
immortality
if
man
believes
that
he
dies
as
the
brute
dies
he
will
soon
live
as
the
brute
lives
and
all
that
is
precious
to
the
heart
of
man
will
be
forever
destroyed
we
recoil
from
such
a
fate
but
live
in
the
serene
assurance
that
such
a
thing
can
never
be
sin
sin
is
a
great
fact
it
can
not
be
denied
it
can
not
be
explained
by
evolution
it
is
universal
every
race
all
nations
with
all
grades
of
intellect
and
culture
civilized
or
uncivilized
are
cursed
with
sin
all
the
wrongs
all
crimes
in
the
world
all
immoralities
are
due
to
sin
sin
causes
tremendous
destruction
of
life
property
and
character
why
is
it
universal
when
did
it
originate
did
it
originate
in
all
the
members
of
the
race
at
one
time
did
some
become
sinners
and
others
remain
without
sin
sin
must
be
developed
since
brutes
have
no
sin
why
not
some
of
the
without
sin
does
natural
selection
explain
the
universal
sinfulness
of
man
on
the
ground
that
those
who
did
not
have
this
perished
they
all
died
and
only
sinners
were
left
hence
all
survivors
are
sinners
sin
makes
men
more
fit
and
hence
sinners
only
survive
is
evolution
simply
ridiculous
or
a
crime
when
in
the
of
did
he
become
a
sinner
a
million
years
ago
judging
from
the
pictures
of
fierce
alleged
it
must
have
been
a
long
long
time
ago
did
all
become
sinners
then
what
became
of
the
progeny
of
those
who
had
not
secured
the
attainment
of
sin
why
have
not
other
members
of
the
monkey
family
become
sinners
why
do
we
not
hang
them
for
murder
will
they
yet
attain
unto
sinfulness
wells
the
alleged
historian
says
outline
of
all
the
animals
and
man
had
been
evolved
in
this
ascendant
manner
then
there
had
been
no
first
parents
no
eden
and
no
fall
and
if
there
had
been
no
fall
then
the
entire
historical
fabric
of
christianity
the
story
of
the
first
sin
and
the
reason
for
an
atonement
upon
which
the
current
teaching
based
christian
emotion
and
morality
collapses
like
a
house
of
evolution
claims
that
man
fell
up
and
not
down
it
denies
almost
every
truth
of
religion
and
the
bible
as
well
as
of
experience
is
falling
upward
he
is
his
own
savior
he
is
ever
progressing
and
has
no
need
of
a
contrast
this
with
the
sublime
statements
of
the
word
of
god
concerning
the
creation
and
the
fall
of
man
evolution
is
charged
with
explaining
all
phenomena
pertaining
to
man
and
body
it
exhausts
itself
in
trying
to
show
that
the
body
of
man
may
be
developed
from
the
brute
it
fails
miserably
the
problem
of
accounting
for
the
soul
of
man
with
all
its
equipment
is
so
much
more
difficult
that
little
or
no
effort
is
made
to
account
for
it
virtually
confessing
that
the
theory
of
evolution
can
not
possibly
be
true
when
applied
to
the
soul
as
well
as
the
body
redemption
evolution
does
not
account
for
sin
much
less
does
it
have
any
cure
for
sin
if
sin
marks
progress
or
advancement
of
course
its
cure
would
be
retrogression
but
how
can
sin
be
cured
what
answer
has
evolution
culture
education
refinement
favorable
environment
these
are
all
desirable
but
no
cure
for
sin
some
of
the
most
cultured
educated
and
refined
were
the
greatest
monsters
that
ever
lived

they

no

the
doctrine
of

taught
so
zealously
in
the
universities
played
a
large
part
human
efforts

human
devices
have
utterly
failed
to

sin
the
human
will
is
too
feeble
to
resist
its

the

which
evolution
undermines
teaches
us
there

a
cure
for
sin

us
from
our

told
that

imprisoned

our
campaign
against
god

must

out

is
with

the
why
should
we

to
harmonize
christianity
with

when
the

can
not
possibly
be
true

in

and
an

a

even
a

can
say
that
to

is
quite
a
different
problem

endeavors

show
where

but
the
is

how
can
a
theory

by

in
the
home
of
a

early
in
the

with
uplifted

she
prayed
and

time
the
tremendous
inflowing
power
of
the
holy
behold
the
power
of

to
ruin
and
of
christ
to
save
evolutionists
are
as
a
rule
modernists
and
modernists
are
evolutionists
and
are
reckless
in
their
zeal
to
destroy
the
faith
of
the
young
committed
to
their
care
we
select
the
following
illustrations
from
a
single
article
in
the
presbyterian
father
sat
this
a
minister
above
middle
life
his
eyes
full
of
tears
and
his
soul
full
of
groans
as
he
told
how
he
had
sent
his
son
who
had
been
an
orderly
christian
boy
to
a
supposedly
christian
college
when
the
boy
returned
home
after
graduation
he
informed
his
father
that
through
instruction
received
he
had
lost
his
faith
and
believed
none
of
those
things
he
had
been
taught
at
home
the
father
was
so
shocked
and
overcome
he
could
make
no
reply
but
asked
his
son
to
kneel
and
pray
with
him
as
they
used
to
do
the
son
refused
and
said
he
no
longer
believed
in
good
christian
father
desired
to
give
his
young
daughter
the
best
educational
advantages
she
planned
to
be
a
missionary
he
sent
her
to
a
college
considered
christian
this
college
had
a
bible
chair
but
of
the
destructive
critical
type
the
young
student
absorbed
what
she
was
taught
she
lost
all
reverence
for
the
bible
and
rejected
it
she
entirely
lost
her
faith
which
she
had
learned
from
her
father
and
mother
she
gave
up
her
mission
plans
and
developed
into
a
socialist
when
about
to
graduate
she
wrote
her
father
frankly
that
she
had
given
up
the
faith
he
had
taught
her
and
she
was
going
to
live
with
a
man
without
marriage
as
she
did
not
believe
in
marriage
the
father
visited
her
and
protested
she
smiled
and
called
him
an
old
fogy
she
only
consented
to
marriage
when
threatened
with
the
civil
case
reported
to
us
by
another
father
son
attending
a
christian
college
reported
that
one
of
the
professors
declared
that
they
and
himself
were
hypocrites
because
they
attended
chapel
every
morning
where
they
were
told
that
if
they
believed
and
did
such
things
they
would
some
day
go
to
another
world
and
play
on
a
harp
but
if
they
did
not
they
would
burn
this
he
declared
was
all
bosh
then
he
called
attention
to
the
teachings
in
the
college
that
in
his
body
developed
from
a
lower
animal
but
that
man
had
no
yet
some
colleges
and
universities
ask
christian
people
to
give
large
sums
with
no
guarantee
that
evolution
infidelity
and
atheism
will
not
be
taught
is
it
any
wonder
that
christian
parents
tremble
while
their
sons
and
daughters
run
the
gauntlet
of
infidel
professors
ev
wars
with
christianity
evolution
leads
to
infidelity
and
atheism
and
is
therefore
a
foe
to
christianity
it
denies
the
doctrine
of
special
creation
and
opposes
the
religion
of
the
christian
the
jew
and
the
mohammedan
why
should
not
all
these
religions
unite
against
the
false
and
unsupported
theory
that
would
make
havoc
of
them
all
if
evolution
could
be
shown
reconcilable
with
christianity
it
would
be
lifted
into
respectability
but
what
would
be
the
gain
to
christianity
the
christian
religion
is
reconcilable
with
all
true
science
and
hails
every
true
science
with
joy
the
church
loves
true
science
but
hates
a
lie
that
poses
as
the
truth
christianity
is
readily
reconcilable
with
the
true
sciences
of
astronomy
and
chemistry
but
we
do
not
try
to
reconcile
it
with
the
corresponding
false
sciences
of
astrology
and
alchemy
why
should
we
be
concerned
about
such
a
reconciliation
since
all
the
evidence
offered
in
favor
of
evolution
is
not
worthy
of
serious
consideration
the
facts
hotly
contest
every
guess
there
is
no
conflict
between
christianity
and
science
but
evolution
is
not
science
it
is
not
knowledge
it
is
not
truth
it
is
not
proved
it
is
not
certain
it
is
not
probable
it
is
not
possible
how
can
the
serious
student
escape
the
conviction
that
evolution
has
not
one
chance
out
of
a
thousand
or
even
out
of
a
million
to
be
a
possible
theory
and
none
whatever
to
be
a
probable
or
proven
theory
it
offers
not
one
convincing
argument
the
evidence
against
the
theory
shows
that
it
has
not
yet
been
proven
and
never
can
be
the
present
population
of
the
globe
shows
the
unity
of
man
in
the
days
of
noah
and
that
the
human
race
could
not
have
begun
years
ago
nor
nor
nor
even
and
no
evidence
that
the
evolutionist
can
bring
to
bear
or
can
ever
set
aside
this
mathematical
demonstration
this
one
argument
is
sufficient
to
shatter
evolution
if
there
were
no
more
but
the
whole
fifty
arguments
in
this
book
rush
to
the
support
of
this
one
they
all
harmonize
with
the
bible
statements
but
not
one
of
them
with
the
false
and
baneful
theory
of
evolution
and
no
erroneous
guess
that
they
can
make
will
escape
mathematical
detection
why
should
we
gratify
the
clamor
of
evolutionists
and
seek
to
reconcile
christianity
with
a
theory
so
manifestly
false
to
be
worthy
of
acceptance
it
must
satisfactorily
answer
every
one
of
the
fifty
arguments
in
this
book
and
many
more
can
it
do
so
evolution
carried
to
a
logical
conclusion
would
destroy
every
thing
precious
to
the
heart
of
a
christian
it
denies
the
real
inspiration
of
the
bible
it
makes
moses
a
liar
it
denies
the
story
of
creation
and
substitutes
an
impossible
guess
it
denies
miracles
the
providence
of
god
the
creation
of
man
and
beast
and
government
and
control
of
the
world
it
laughs
at
the
virgin
birth
and
makes
christ
a
descendant
of
the
brute
on
both
sides
it
denies
his
deity
his
miracles
his
resurrection
from
the
dead
it
joins
hands
with
agnosticism
modernism
and
other
forms
of
infidelity
and
atheism
and
gives
them
the
strongest
support
they
have
ever
had
all
these
hail
advent
with
exceeding
great
joy
it
has
the
closest
affinity
with
the
wildest
and
worst
theories
ever
proposed
its
writers
and
proponents
turn
infidel
and
atheist
its
teachers
and
advocates
lose
their
belief
in
god
and
the
immortality
of
the
soul
the
young
men
and
women
who
are
taught
abandon
the
faith
of
their
fathers
and
join
the
forces
of
unbelief
to
be
sure
some
are
saved
by
inconsistency
and
still
maintain
their
faith
but
the
havoc
is
great
it
would
strip
christ
of
his
deity
reduce
him
to
the
dimensions
of
a
man
and
make
his
religion
powerless
to
save
the
men
who
tore
the
seamless
coat
from
the
dying
christ
did
a
praiseworthy
act
in
comparison
to
those
who
would
strip
him
of
his
deity
and
glory
for
these
are
the
garments
of
god
the
ruffians
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
gambled
for
a
mere
human
garment
but
there
are
evolutionists
who
would
under
foot
the
blood
of
the
son
of
god
and
count
it
an
unholy
those
who
would
rob
the
redeemer
of
his
power
and
divinity
while
speaking
patronizingly
in
praise
of
his
human
traits
do
but
insult
him
with
the
vilest
slander
which
makes
the
derision
of
calvary
seem
like
praise
we
were
not
surprised
to
learn
that
in
the
trial
evolution
was
defended
by
agnostics
who
made
their
chief
attack
on
the
bible
and
revealed
religion
and
the
school
the
home
and
religion
were
defended
by
men
of
high
christian
character
had
darrow
as
earnestly
defended
christianity
and
bryan
as
earnestly
opposed
it
millions
would
have
held
up
their
hands
in
astonishment
but
the
alignment
was
natural
and
opened
the
eyes
of
multitudes
to
the
fact
that
evolution
is
a
friend
to
infidelity
and
a
foe
to
christianity
their
objection
to
prayer
during
the
sessions
of
the
court
shows
that
they
hated
what
god
loves
christianity
withstood
ten
fiery
persecutions
lasting
years
at
the
hands
of
the
roman
empire
the
mistress
of
the
world
the
church
was
purified
and
grew
and
multiplied
numerous
heresies
arose
but
all
yielded
to
the
truth
sin
and
corruption
formality
and
worldliness
failed
to
hinder
the
triumphant
march
of
the
church
of
god
infidelity
made
a
fierce
attack
in
the
eighteenth
century
in
its
own
name
and
lost
but
the
most
dangerous
attack
ever
made
is
on
by
evolution
claiming
the
name
of
science
and
modernism
claiming
the
name
of
religion
this
is
truly
for
a
day
god
will
win
truth
will
live
and
error
will
die
but
too
many
precious
souls
will
be
lost
unless
the
world
awakes
to
see
its
danger
soon
bryan
in
his
last
message
said
has
made
of
death
a
narrow
starlit
strip
between
the
companionship
of
yesterday
and
the
reunion
of
tomorrow
evolution
strikes
out
the
stars
and
deepens
the
gloom
that
enshrouds
the
these
evolutionists
stop
to
think
of
the
crime
they
commit
when
they
take
faith
out
of
the
hearts
of
men
and
women
and
lead
them
out
into
a
starless
night
evolution
wars
with
the
religion
of
the
jews
also
it
attacks
the
old
testament
dear
alike
to
christian
and
jew
the
jews
were
the
chosen
people
of
god
and
have
played
a
large
part
in
the
history
of
the
world
we
gladly
clasp
hands
with
them
against
the
common
foe
david
speaks
for
jews
and
christians
in
the
psalm
in
contrast
to
evolution
which
degrades
man
to
the
level
of
the
brute
he
declares
that
man
is
but
a
little
lower
than
god
heb
elohim
the
revisers
had
the
courage
so
to
translate
it
david
under
inspiration
wrote
better
than
he
knew
and
in
absolute
harmony
with
modern
science
i
consider
thy
heavens
the
work
of
thy
fingers
the
moon
and
the
stars
which
thou
hast
ordained
what
is
man
how
great
must
he
be
that
thou
are
mindful
of
him
among
thy
great
and
marvelous
works
and
the
son
of
man
that
thou
are
a
companion
to
him
for
thou
hast
made
him
but
little
lower
than
god
and
crownest
him
with
glory
and
honor
thou
madest
him
to
have
dominion
over
the
works
of
thy
hands
thou
hast
put
all
things
under
his
feet
all
sheep
and

yea
and

and

the
dominion
of
man
since
the
strongest
and
fiercest
flee
from
his
face
who
would
prefer
the
of
that
would
place
man
below
the
brute
to
the
lofty
description
of
the
hebrew
psalmist
placing
him
a
little
lower
than
god
hon
william
bryan
when
attending
the
presbyterian
general
assembly
in
columbus
ohio
in
enclosed
in
a
letter
to
the
writer
a
copy
of
his
address
in
john
church
philadelphia
on
evolution
and
modernism
from
which
we
select
the
following
the
modernists
are
evolutionists
and
their
hypothesis
of
creation
gives
man
a
brute
ancestry
and
makes
him
the
apex
of
a
gradual
development
extending
over
millions
of
years
this
hypothesis
contains
no
place
for
and
has
no
need
of
a
plan
of
salvation
it
is
only
a
step
from
this
philosophy
to
the
philosophy
of
the
atheist
who
considers
man
bundle
of
tendencies
inherited
from
the
lower
animals
and
regards
sin
as
nothing
more
serious
than
a
disease
that
should
be
treated
rather
than
punished
one
of
the
gravest
objections
to
the
doctrine
of
the
modernists
is
that
it
ignores
sin
in
the
sense
in
which
the
bible
describes
sin
modernists
ignore
the
cause
of
sin
the
effects
of
sin
and
the
remedy
for
sin
they
worship
the
intellect
and
overlook
the
heart
of
which
are
the
issues
of
no
evangelical
church
has
ever
endorsed
a
single
doctrine
of
the
modernists
is
the
basis
of
modernism
carried
to
its
logical
conclusion
it
annihilates
revealed
religion
it
made
an
avowed
agnostic
of
darwin
see
in
his
and
a
letter
written
on
this
subject
just
before
his
death
it
has
made
agnostics
of
millions
and
atheists
of
hundreds
of
thousands
yet
christian
taxpayers
not
awake
to
its
benumbing
influence
allow
darwinism
to
be
injected
into
the
minds
of
immature
students
many
of
whom
return
from
college
with
their
spiritual
enthusiasm
chilled
if
not
destroyed
we
protest
against
the
teaching
of
this
by
instructors
paid
by
taxation
they
accuse
us
of
stifling
conscience
and
interfering
with
free
speech
not
at
all
let
the
atheist
think
what
he
pleases
and
say
what
he
thinks
to
those
who
are
willing
to
listen
to
him
but
he
can
not
rightly
demand
pay
from
the
taxpayers
for
teaching
their
children
what
they
do
not
want
taught
the
hand
that
writes
the
pay
check
rules
the
school
as
long
as
christians
must
build
christian
colleges
in
which
to
teach
christianity
atheists
should
be
required
to
build
their
own
colleges
if
they
desire
to
teach
atheism
from
one
to
three
millions
of
distinct
species
in
the
animal
and
vegetable
world
not
a
single
species
has
been
traced
to
another
until
species
in
the
animal
and
vegetable
world
can
be
linked
together
why
should
we
assume
without
proof
that
man
is
a
blood
relative
of
any
lower
form
of
life
those
who
become
obsessed
with
the
idea
that
they
have
brute
blood
in
their
veins
devote
their
time
to
searching
for
missing
links
in
the
hope
of
connecting
man
with
life
below
him
why
do
they
prefer
a
jungle
ancestry
to
creation
by
the
almighty
for
a
purpose
and
according
to
a
divine
plan
why
will
they
travel
around
the
world
to
find
a
part
of
a
skull
or
remnants
of
a
skeleton
when
they
will
not
cross
the
street
to
save
a
soul
can
intelligent
men
and
women
underestimate
the
christ
he
is
no
longer
a
wandering
jew
with
a
few
followers
he
is
the
great
fact
of
history
and
the
growing
figure
of
all
is
no
other
growing
figure
in
all
the
world
today
greatest
of
and
reign
and
pass
away
only
christ
reigns
and
remains
they
shall
not
take
away
our
lord
the
christian
church
will
not
permit
the
degrading
of
its
founder
it
will
defend
at
all
times
everywhere
and
in
every
way
the
historical
christ
it
believes
that
is
none
other
name
under
heaven
given
among
men
whereby
we
must
be
no
diminutive
messiah
can
meet
the
religious
need
of
the
world
today
and
throughout
the
centuries
christ
for
all
and
forever
is
the
slogan
of
the
church
there
has
been
apostasy
in
every
age
attacks
upon
christianity
have
been
disguised
under
cloaks
of
many
kinds
but
it
has
withstood
them
hammers
are
shattered
but
the
anvil
the
church
will
not
yield
now
it
will
continue
its
defense
of
the
bible
the
god
and
the
christ
until
knee
shall
bow
and
every
tongue
it
resists
the
attacks
upon
the
integrity
of
word
and
the
divinity
of
the
saviour
it
will
pray
that
those
who
are
now
making
the
attack
may
come
under
the
influence
of
and
yield
their
hearts
to
him
whose
call
is
to
all
whose
hand
is
all
power
and
who
promises
to
be
with
his
people
even
unto
the
end
of
the
world
the
creed
which
has
expressed
the
faith
of
the
christian
church
for
so
many
centuries
shall
not
be
emasculated
by
modernism
of
our
fathers
living
still
in
spite
of
dungeon
fire
and
sword
o
how
our
hearts
beat
high
with
joy
we
hear
that
glorious
faith
of
our
fathers
holy
faith
we
will
be
true
to
thee
till
camouflage
of
terms
during
the
late
world
war
objects
were
concealed
and
the
enemy
deceived
by
many
undertake
to
deceive
or
to
hide
their
meaning
by
a
camouflage
of
terms
these
terms
are
chosen
to
conceal
or
deceive
terms
that
suggest
advance
improvement
learning
science
are
used
to
describe
unworthy
theories
beliefs
and
movements
it
is
an
unfair
trick
to
win
and
often
meets
with
undeserved
success
evolution
in
the
sense
of
growth
and
development
is
true
of
a
part
of
animal
and
plant
life
and
in
this
sense
is
undisputed
some
speak
of
the
growth
of
a
child
and
of
all
progress
as
evolution
in
the
sense
at
issue
it
means
the
development
of
all
the
species
of
animals
and
plants
from
one
or
a
few
primordial
germs
without
design
or
intelligence
or
the
aid
of
a
creator
a
distinguished
surgeon
declares
that
evolution
from
the
monkey
is
mere
but
that
life
is
a
constant
evolution
senses
in
the
same
sentence
such
confusion
of
meaning
brings
science
into
disrepute
the
meaning
is
shifted
to
suit
science
means
knowledge
we
are
glibly
told
that
science
teaches
the
evolution
of
man
when
it
teaches
nothing
of
the
kind
a
mere
theory
is
not
science
until
proven
a
man
does
not
become
a
scientist
by
advocating
an
unproven
theory
but
by
making
some
notable
contribution
to
knowledge
these
scientists
recklessly
declare
that
the
of
science
favors
evolution
we
oppose
evolution
not
because
it
science
but
because
it
is
science
there
is
no
conflict
between
christianity
and
real
science
but
a
fight
to
the
death
with
falsely
so
religion
is
often
taken
to
mean
deism
or
infidelity
as
well
as
christianity
they
show
us
evolution
and
religion
meet
provided
deism
or
infidelity
is
religion
but
not
if
christianity
is
religion
inexcusable
confusion
of
terms
law
is
sometimes
spoken
of
as
if
it
had
intelligence
and
power
sometimes
as
a
subordinate
deity
or
agent
of
god
or
an
indefinite
principle
darwin
says
and
animals
have
all
been
produced
by
laws
acting
around
that
is
impossible
since
can
produce
nothing
he
evidently
gives
to
laws
the
credit
that
belongs
to
god
nature
in
like
manner
is
often
used
as
a
substitute
for
god
to
avoid
the
mention
of
his
name
modernism
is
a
fine
sounding
word
suggestive
of
learning
and
culture
and
the
last
word
in
science
but
doubts
or
denies
many
of
the
essential
doctrines
of
the
christian
religion
it
is
infidelity
pure
and
simple
and
of
the
most
dangerous
kind
camouflaged
under
this
attractive
name
who
can
deny
the
statement
that
the
only
thing
modern
about
modernism
is
its
hypocrisy
it
is
ancient
infidelity
pretending
to
be
a
christian
view
bearing
the
christian
flag
it
attacks
christianity
modernists
are
evidently
ashamed
of
a
name
which
fitly
describes
their
views
and
seek
another
infidels
have
tried
to
win
under
their
own
name
they
have
failed
will
they
succeed
under
the
camouflaged
name
of
modernism
camouflaged
under
an
attractive
name
modernists
doubt
or
deny
the
real
inspiration
of
the
bible
the
virgin
birth
of
jesus
his
deity
his
miracles
his
bodily
resurrection
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
and
his
personal
second
coming
to
judge
the
quick
and
the
dead
some
modernists
reject
a
part
of
these
great
truths
and
some
reject
all
liberal
is
another
term
stolen
by
infidels
ashamed
of
their
own
name
they
are
no
more
liberal
in
a
good
sense
than
others
a
rationalist
is
not
entitled
to
the
term
because
he
is
often
more
innocent
of
reasoning
than
his
opponents
reason
is
not
opposed
to
revelation
we
believe
in
an
inspired
revelation
because
it
is
reasonable
to
do
so
rationalism
is
another
camouflage
for
infidelity
we
can
have
some
respect
for
an
honest
professed
skeptic
but
how
can
we
respect
a
man
who
insists
on
adding
hypocrisy
to
his
infidelity
that
by
so
doing
he
may
make
greater
havoc
of
the
church
modernists
give
such
a
diluted
interpretation
to
inspiration
to
the
statements
of
scripture
and
the
creed
and
the
creeds
of
the
churches
that
all
may
mean
little
or
nothing
and
the
floodgates
of
infidelity
and
atheism
are
opened
wide
it
has
been
truly
said
the
bible
is
not
really
inspired
it
is
the
greatest
fraud
ever
perpetrated
on
mankind
for
from
lid
to
lid
it
claims
to
be
the
word
of
likewise
if
moses
was
not
inspired
he
was
the
greatest
liar
of
history
every
variety
of
infidel
and
species
of
atheist
will
rejoice
if
evolution
be
accepted
modernists
liberals
rationalists
or
simple
unbelievers
on
their
way
to
the
bottomless
pit
if
evolution
wins
christianity
loses
and
the
church
fails
we
hope
that
scientists
will
consign
to
innocuous
desuetude
their
camouflaged
sesquipedalian
vocabularies
and
tell
us
what
they
mean
in
short
words
so
we
all
may
know
what
they
say
what
are
we
to
believe
some
would
have
us
believe
there
is
no
god
or
that
matter
is
eternal
or
that
matter
was
evolved
out
of
nothing
or
that
all
things
came
by
chance
or
that
there
is
nothing
but
matter
god
no
spirit
no
mind
no
soul
some
would
have
us
believe
that
god
created
nebulous
matter
and
then
ceased
to
control
the
universe
that
life
developed
spontaneously
that
species
developed
by
chance
or
natural
selection
or
by
a
powerless
from
one
primordial
germ
others
say
that
all
the
countless
exhibitions
of
design
by
a
matchless
intelligence
are
to
be
explained
by
a
theory
which
means
the
theory
of
blind
unintelligent
chance
without
purpose
or
design
or
interference
of
god
some
say
that
god
may
have
created
one
germ
or
at
most
or
and
that
species
of
plants
and
animals
developed
from
this
microscopic
beginning
we
are
asked
to
believe
that
some
plants
became
animals
or
some
animals
became
plants
or
that
all
plants
and
animals
came
from
the
one
germ
they
allowed
god
to
create
they
say
that
all
species
developed
by
growth
but
do
not
explain
why
we
still
have
the
amoeba
the
microscopic
bacilli
of
plant
life
and
the
microscopic
species
of
animal
life
many
geologic
species
are
largest
at
the
beginning
many
ancient
animals
were
much
larger
than
their
successors
and
the
reptilian
age
was
noted
for
animals
of
enormous
size
yet
they
want
us
to
believe
that
growth
is
universal
they
ask
us
to
believe
without
proof
that
some
marine
animals
evoluted
into
amphibians
some
amphibians
became
reptiles
some
reptiles
developed
hair
and
became
mammals
and
some
reptiles
developed
feathers
and
wings
and
became
birds
some
mammals
became
monkeys
and
some
monkeys
became
men
for
evidence
of
this
there
is
not
a
single
connecting
link
to
show
the
transformation
geology
furnishes
no
fossils
of
the
millions
and
billions
of
connecting
links
that
must
have
existed
for
the
scheme
would
require
not
only
millions
of
links
between
man
and
the
monkey
but
also
millions
between
each
of
the
great
changes
from
matter
to
man
yet
we
are
asked
to
accept
these
fantastic
and
impossible
speculations
as
though
it
lead
to
infidelity
and
atheism
and
bolshevism
and
anarchy
and
chaos
wreck
religion
make
havoc
of
the
church
and
send
countless
souls
to
the
lost
world
what
wonder
that
the
soul
recoils
with
horror
from
such
an
atheistic
theory
what
can
we
do
evolution
leading
to
infidelity
and
atheism
is
taught
in
many
universities
colleges
and
high
schools
and
even
in
the
lower
grades
of
the
public

it
is

also
in

seminaries
it

in
some

some
of
its
devotees
who
have
slipped
into
places
of
power
and
influence
urge
it
with
a
zeal
worthy
of
a
better
cause
the
public
libraries
are
crammed
with
books
teaching
it
with
few
if
any
opposed
strange
to
say
it
is
advocated
by
some
religious
newspapers
along
with
modernism
and
other
varieties
of
infidelity
some
secular
newspapers
seem
eager
to
publish
on
the

attacks
on

we
supinely
submit

do
all
in
our
power
to
oppose

suppress

pernicious

what
can
we
do
we
can
refuse

such

we

to
do

the

to

if
there

the

strong
hope
that

were
carried
up
to
the

it
should

if

must
we
submit

intolerable
outrage
in

on

condemned
the

government
a

should
not
be

when
the

awake
to
see
the
baneful

they
will
smite

protests
should
be
made
to
boards
of

superintendents
and
all
in
authority
the
power
of
public
opinion
should
be
brought
to
bear
two
states
already
have
forbidden
such
instruction
and
others
will
no
doubt
follow
the
associated
press
in
this
papers
calls
the
struggle
a
contest
between
religion
and
science
and
thousands
of
shallow
thinkers
will
believe
that
evolution
is
really
science
we
quote
from
at
the
bar
parent
writing
to
a
religious
periodical
tells
of
a
text
book
brought
home
by
his
boy
the
title
of
which
was
geography
for
primary
discussing
the
subject
of
birds
this
text
book
for
primary
grades
says
so
long
ago
their
grandfathers
were
not
birds
at
all
then
they
could
not
fly
for
they
had
neither
wings
nor
feathers
these
grandfathers
of
our
birds
had
four
legs
a
long
tail
and
jaws
with
teeth
after
a
time
feathers
grew
on
their
bodies
and
their
front
legs
were
changed
for
flying
these
were
strange
looking
creatures
there
are
none
living
like
them
would
any
one
who
would
teach
a
little
child
the
extremely
improbable
story
that
reptiles
became
birds
hesitate
to
teach
that
monkeys
became
men
and
that
the
story
of
creation
was
false
much
can
be
done
by
the
church
authorities
in
refusing
to
license
or
ordain
men
who
believe
in
any
species
of
infidelity
or
who
have
attended
heretical
seminaries
they
should
give
their
consent
for
candidates
to
attend
only
colleges
universities
or
seminaries
that
can
be
trusted
congregations
should
know
before
they
call
a
pastor
that
he
is
orthodox
ministers
are
to
preach
the
gospel
not
infidelity
taboo
all
heretical
religious
papers
support
those
that
defend
the
truth
let
infidels
maintain
infidel
papers
and
build
infidel
colleges
not
one
dollar
to
propagate
infidelity
make
your
one
short
consecrated
life
count
for
truth
and
righteousness
many
christians
are
guilty
of
the
great
sin
of
indifference
in
this
greatest
of
all
contests
in
which
the
church
was
ever
engaged
no
one
should
be
a
slacker
many
public
libraries
have
to
books
in
favor
of
evolution
and
but
one
or
two
if
any
opposed
if
dangerous
books
like
of
of
and
the
works
of
darwin
who
doubted
his
own
theory
and
of
romanes
who
renounced
evolution
and
embraced
christ
can
not
be
eliminated
libraries
in
all
fairness
and
in
the
interest
of
truth
should
have
an
equal
number
in
reply
insist
that
librarians
get
a
copy
of
this
book
and
other
books
especially
those
mentioned
herein
also
other
good
books
the
author
and
publisher
of
this
book
will
give
commission
for
selling
it
and
will
mail
two
copies
for
to
all
who
will
become
agents
if
you
be
an
agent
you
will
do
great
good
by
securing
another
a
copy
should
be
in
the
hands
of
every
student
so
he
can
discuss
evolution
with
his
teacher
and
in
the
hands
of
every
teacher
lawyer
doctor
minister
lawmaker
or
other
professional
man
of
every
parent
whose
children
are
liable
to
be
taught
the
dangerous
doctrine
it
will
be
useful
in
removing
error
and
in
promoting
the
truth
agents
should

account

such

can
there
be
any

of

brute
did
any
other

that
ever

secular
newspapers
of

world
and
to
aid
in
the

distribution
of
this

as
explained
on
pages
and
how

will
every

thereon
help

what

what

as

persuades
a
great
multitude
to
accept

infidelity

by

what
more
fitting
climax
in
honor
of
christ
whose
worshipers
belt
the
globe
is
all
a
pean
of
praise
which
has
been
sung
both
sides
the
sea
and
published
in
three
hymnals
and
over
sixty
song
books
will
close
this
volume
dedicated
to
the
glory
of
god
art
the
christ
the
son
of
the
living
jesus
asked
a
great
question
and
peter
made
a
great
reply
no
prophet
no
priest
no
king
no
patriarch
of
israel
had
ever
been
greeted
in
such
fashion
of
nobody
else
in
the
world
are
these
words
spoken
today
how
pure
must
have
been
the
life
how
majestic
the
personality
how
wise
the
utterances
how
divine
the
deeds
that
compelled
this
thrilling
answer
from
the
lips
surely
something
really
wonderful
beyond
all
previous
hebrew
experience
was
necessary
before
jews
could
bring
themselves
to
acknowledge
any
man
however
exalted
as
divine
the
miracle
of
winning
such
a
confession
is
testimony
to
the
sovereign
greatness
of
jesus
we
too
have
to
answer
the
same
question
and
there
are
facts
which
lead
us
to
the
same
great
confession
of
faith
five
tremendous
facts
jesus
a
peasant
is
hailed
today
as
king
by
people
speaking
languages
and
dialects
in
all
climes
and
of
all
classes
people
of
every
color
raise
to
him
the
song
of
praise
and
crown
him
of
there
is
nothing
like
this
in
all
history
no
other
has
ever
approached
this
degree
of
sovereignty
his
kingdom
pervades
the
world
it
is
a
fact
that
challenges
thought
no
world
conqueror
has
ever
had
such
an
empire
beside
this
the
royalty
of
men
like
alexander
caesar
charlemagne
napoleon
and
more
modern
aspirants
is
shadowy
and
ghostlike
his
is
an
abiding
and
a
spiritual
dominion
though
an
unlettered
peasant
jesus
has
become
the
greatest
teacher
for
all
our
best
knowledge
of
god
for
the
revelation
of
divine
fatherly
love
for
our
highest
ideals
of
virtue
for
most
glorious
hope
people
on
all
sides
look
to
him
not
only
men
of
the
highest
rank
but
men
of
the
richest
culture
sit
at
his
feet
the
purest
souls
sit
at
his
feet
his
golden
rule
will
never
be
supplanted
his
name
has
become
the
synonym
for
all
that
is
true
and
gracious
to
be
must
ever
remain
highest
ideal
he
was
a
jew
and
yet
he
founded
the
brotherhood
of
man
in
his
day
jews
had
no
dealings
with
samaritans
but
jesus
had
jews
were
fenced
off
from
all
other
nations
in
the
most
exclusive
way
but
his
heart
was
and
he
broke
down
all
walls
that
separated
class
from
class
as
well
as
nation
from
nation
his
thought
was
universal
his
spirit
was
international
he
founded
a
kingdom
based
as
napoleon
said
not
on
force
but
on
love
and
love
is
universal
it
leaps
over
mountains
it
spans
oceans
it
speaks
in
all
tongues
the
true
league
of
nations
and
the
real
disarmament
are
part
of
his
plan
for
the
world
he
was
son
of
israel
only
incidentally
essentially
he
was
son
of
true
brother
of
all
mankind
his
life
was
short
but
it
changed
the
world
no
one
ever
did
so
much
in
so
short
a
time
at
the
most
his
years
numbered
years
and
of
these
only
a
little
less
than
three
were
devoted
to
public
ministry
and
these
were
spent
in
a
conquered
province
of
the
roman
empire
he
was
killed
by
aliens
at
the
request
of
his
own
countrymen
and
yet
time
is
reckoned
from
his
birth
the
very
terms
and
have
great
significance
he
divides
not
only
time
but
also
space
the
nations
are
christian
and
which
is
about
equal
to
saying
civilized
and
barbarous
one
has
only
to
think
of
the
ideals
and
practices
of
pagan
people
before
they
received
the
influences
of
christianity
to
see
the
difference
he
makes
everywhere
no
tribe
on
earth
was
ever
lifted
from
savagery
by
the
influence
of
socrates
no
soul
was
ever
saved
by
his
name
and
yet
socrates
was
the
wisest
and
noblest
of
the
greeks
he
lived
for
seventy
years
and
for
forty
years
taught
the
young
men
in
the
most
cultured
age
and
among
the
most
intellectual
people
in
the
world
but
jesus
has
lifted
cannibals
and
washed
the
souls
of
men
who
were
steeped
in
blackest
vice
the
rationalist
lecky
said
that
the
simple
record
of
his
three
brief
years
of
active
life
had
done
more
to
regenerate
and
soften
mankind
than
all
the
disquisitions
of
philosophers
and
than
all
the
exhortations
of
moralists
he
was
crucified
and
made
of
the
cross
a
throne
from
which
to
rule
the
hearts
of
men
the
cross
was
a
gallows
far
more
hideous
and
cruel
than
the
gallows
it
was
the
symbol
of
crime
of
shame
of
degradation
he
transformed
it
it
is
today
the
symbol
of
love
of
purity
of
virtue
his
dream
came
true
once
only
did
a
man
dream
that
by
dying
upon
a
cross
would
he
teach
men
to
say
that
god
is
love
that
love
is
universal
that
there
is
hope
for
sinners
and
that
the
worship
of
god
must
be
spiritual
this
is
the
miracle
of
the
ages
the
crucified
has
become
the
king
here
then
are
five
tremendous
facts
they
are
unique
if
only
one
were
true
it
would
make
him
remarkable
but
they
are
all
true
the
meaning
of
the
facts
what
shall
we
say
of
this
man
he
accepted
tribute
he
allowed
jews
to
take
up
stones
to
stone
him
for
claiming
to
be
son
of
god
he
was
conscious
of
being
divine
he
forgave
sins
which
is
prerogative
he
promised
rest
to
the
weary
soul
which
the
old
testament
set
forth
as
own
gift
he
said
that
he
came
to
give
life
eternal
although
god
is
the
giver
of
life
he
said
that
none
could
know
the
father
except
through
him
he
spoke
to
god
of
the
glory
which
they
shared
together
before
the
world
was
just
in
proportion
as
men
have
acknowledged
his
claims
in
their
hearts
have
they
found
peace
with
god
and
conquest
over
sin
and
the
fear
of
worldly
evil
as
we
consider
all
these
things
we
are
led
to
repeat
confession
are
the
christ
the
son
of
the
living
god
for
god
the
face
shines
upon
us
through
him
and
heaven
is
opened
to
us
as
we
look
upon
him
in
the
heart
of
this
the
purest
of
men
was
the
clear
constant
consciousness
that
he
was
divine
he
always
spoke
and
acted
consistently
with
this
consciousness
unique
in
character
he
made
claims
that
would
have
stamped
any
other
man
as
an
impostor
humility
and
majesty
dwell
together
in
him
he
could
say
am
meek
and
lowly
in
heart
and
also
and
my
father
are
he
would
call
men
his
and
yet
accept
from
them
the
words
lord
and
my
this
wonderful
character
came
of
a
race
that
had
for
ages
looked
for
the
coming
of
a
messiah
and
whose
prophetic
literature
was
burdened
with
this
hope
after
his
death
his
disciples
who
were
heartbroken
and
cowed
became
inspired
with
a
heroism
that
cheerfully
faced
martyrdom
all
these
facts
are
shining
lights
that
point
to
the
truth
which
peter
confessed
that
truth
is
enshrined
in
the
triumphant
words
of
the
te
deum
are
the
king
of
glory
o
christ
thou
art
the
everlasting
son
of
the
and
the
christ
of
history
the
exalted
son
of
god
is
a
living
presence
with
us
today
not
remote
but
ever
near
he
walks
by
our
side
in
all
experiences
not
only
enthroned
in
heavenly
glory
warm
sweet
tender
even
yet
a
present
help
is
he
and
faith
has
still
its
olivet
and
love
its
such
is
our
wonderful
saviour
a
friend
with
human
heart
of
sympathy
who
has
trod
our
pathway
and
is
touched
with
the
feeling
of
our
infirmities
a
shepherd
who
gave
his
life
for
the
sheep
in
an
sacrifice
an
advocate
who
represents
us
with
power
before
the
throne
of
the
judge
eternal
a
champion
who
can
break
the
power
of
canceled
sin
and
set
the
prisoner
free
a
victor
who
can
smite
threatening
wave
before
us
a
lord
in
whom
we
see
the
beauty
and
glory
of
the
face
of
god
we
are
called
upon
to
confess
him
with
lip
and
life
to
us
to
live
is
christ
knowing
him
we
have
eternal
life
we
have
all
the
soul
needs
in
jesus
there
is
no
substitute
for
him
none
can
share
his
throne
in
our
hearts
the
kingdom
is
his
who
is
the
anointed
king
our
joy
is
in
him
where
all
fullness
dwells
we
can
say
with
charles
wesley
o
christ
art
all
i
want
and
our
daily
life
should
be
one
of
close
constant
communion
with
christ
illustration
no
christ
is
all
you
therefore
which
believe
he
is
williams
by
per
as
a
soprano
solo
ad
i
entered
once
a
home
of
care
for
age
and
penury
were
there
yet
peace
and
joy
withal
i
asked
the
lonely
mother
whence
her
helpless
defence
she
told
me
was
christ
is
all
all
in
all
she
told
me
was
i
stood
beside
a
dying
bed
where
lay
a
child
with
aching
head
waiting
for
call
i
marked
his
smile
sweet
as
may
and
as
his
spirit
passed
away
he
whispered
is
christ
is
all
all
in
all
he
whispered
is
i
saw
the
martyr
at
the
at
the
stake
the
flames
could
not
his
courage
shake
nor
death
his
soul
appall
i
asked
him
whence
his
strength
was
he
looked
triumphantly
to
and
answered
is
christ
is
all
all
in
all
he
answered
is
i
saw
the
gospel
herald
go
to
sand
and
snow
to
save
from
thrall
no
home
nor
life
he
counted
dear
midst
wants
and
perils
owned
no
fear
he
felt
that
is
christ
is
all
all
in
all
he
felt
that
is
i
dreamed
that
hoary
time
had
fled
the
earth
and
sea
gave
up
their
dead
a
fire
dissolved
this
ball
i
saw
the
throng
i
heard
the
burden
of
their
song
is
all
in
christ
is
all
all
in
all
christ
is
all
in
all
then
come
to
christ
oh
come
today
the
father
son
and
spirit
say
the
bride
repeats
the
call
for
he
will
cleanse
your
guilty
stains
his
love
will
sooth
your
weary
pains
for
