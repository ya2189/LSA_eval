chapter
i
boyhood
in
ireland
the
world
in
which
i
first
found
myself
was
a
world
of
hungry
people
my
earliest
sufferings
were
the
sufferings
of
hunger
physical
hunger
it
was
not
an
unusual
sight
to
see
the
children
of
our
neighbourhood
scratching
the
offal
in
the
dunghills
and
the
gutterways
for
scraps
of
meat
vegetables
and
refuse
many
times
i
have
done
it
myself
my
father
was
a
shoemaker
but
something
had
gone
wrong
with
the
making
of
shoes
improvements
in
machinery
are
pushed
out
into
the
commercial
world
and
explanations
follow
a
new
shoemaker
had
arrived
a
machine
and
my
father
had
to
content
himself
with
the
mending
of
the
work
that
the
machine
produced
it
took
him
about
ten
years
to
find
out
what
had
happened
to
him
there
were
twelve
children
in
our
family
five
of
whom
died
in
childhood
those
of
us
who
were
left
were
sent
out
to
work
as
soon
as
we
were
able
i
began
at
the
age
of
nine
my
first
work
was
peddling
newspapers
i
remember
my
first
night
in
the
streets
food
was
scarce
in
the
home
and
i
begged
to
be
allowed
to
do
what
other
boys
were
doing
but
i
was
not
quite
so
well
prepared
i
began
in
the
winter
i
was
shoeless
hatless
and
in
rags
my
contribution
to
the
family
treasury
amounted
to
about
fifty
cents
a
week
but
it
looked
very
large
to
me
then
it
was
my
first
earning
our
home
was
a
cottage
over
one
room
was
a
little
loft
my
bedroom
for
fourteen
years
the
cottage
floor
was
hard
dried
mud
there
was
a
wide
open
fireplace
several
holes
made
in
the
wall
by
displacing
of
bricks
here
and
there
contained
my
father
old
pipes
a
few
ornaments
yellow
with
the
smoke
of
years
adorned
the
mantelpiece
at
the
front
window
sat
my
father
and
around
him
his
shoemaking
tools
beside
the
window
hung
a
large
cage
made
by
his
own
hands
and
in
which
singing
thrushes
had
succeeded
one
another
for
twenty
years
the
walls
were
whitewashed
there
was
a
little
partition
that
screened
the
from
the
door
it
was
made
of
newspapers
and
plastered
all
over
it
were
pictures
from
the
illustrated
weeklies
two
or
three
small
dressers
contained
the
crockery
ware
a
long
bench
set
against
the
wall
a
table
several
stools
and
two
or
three
creepies
constituted
the
furniture
there
was
not
a
chair
in
the
place
illustration
irvine
birthplace
there
are
four
different
houses
in
the
picture
the
third
door
from
the
left
is
that
of
the
house
in
which
he
was
born
there
was
a
fascination
about
the
winter
evenings
in
that
cottage
scarcely
a
night
passed
that
did
not
see
some
man
or
woman
sitting
in
the
corner
waiting
for
shoes
a
candlestick
about
three
feet
high
in
which
burned
a
large
tallow
candle
was
set
in
front
of
my
father
my
mother
was
the
only
one
in
the
house
who
could
read
and
she
used
to
read
aloud
from
a
story
paper
called
weekly
we
were
never
interested
in
the
news
the
outside
world
was
shut
off
from
us
and
the
news
consisted
of
whatever
was
brought
by
word
of
mouth
by
the
folks
who
had
their
shoes
cobbled
was
interesting
in
those
long
winter
evenings
i
sat
in
the
corner
among
the
shoes
and
lasts
on
scraps
of
leather
i
used
to
imitate
writing
and
often
i
would
quietly
steal
up
to
my
mother
and
show
her
these
scratchings
and
ask
her
whether
they
meant
anything
or
not
i
thought
somehow
by
accident
i
would
surely
get
something
my
mother
merely
shook
her
head
and
smiled
she
taught
me
many
letters
of
the
alphabet
but
it
took
me
years
to
string
them
together
my
mother
had
acquired
a
taste
indeed
it
was
a
craving
for
strong
drink
and
even
from
the
very
small
earnings
of
my
father
managed
to
satisfy
it
in
a
small
measure
every
day
except
sunday
on
sunday
there
was
a
change
the
cobbler
bench
was
cleared
away
and
my
mother
beautiful
face
was
surrounded
with
a
halo
of
spotless
frilled
linen
my
father
sunday
mornings
were
spent
in
giving
the
thrush
an
outing
and
in
cleaning
his
cage
neither
my
father
nor
mother
made
any
pretensions
to
religion
but
they
were
strict
sabbatarians
my
father
never
consciously
swore
but
within
even
the
limitations
of
his
small
vocabulary
he
was
unfortunate
in
his
selection
of
phrases
i
bounced
into
the
alley
one
sunday
morning
whistling
a
moody
and
sankey
hymn
shut
up
yer
mouth
said
my
father
it
a
hymn
tune
i
replied
i
do
care
a
damn
replied
my
father
it
the
lord
day
and
if
i
hear
you
whistlin
in
it
i
whale
the
hell
out
o
ye
that
was
his
philosophy
and
he
lived
it
saturday
nights
when
the
town
clock
struck
the
hour
of
midnight
he
removed
his
leather
apron
pushed
his
bench
back
in
the
corner
and
the
work
of
the
week
was
over
and
if
any
one
was
waiting
for
his
shoes
so
much
the
worse
for
him
he
would
wait
until
the
midnight
clock
struck
twelve
the
next
night
or
take
them
as
they
were
the
first
tragedy
in
my
life
was
the
death
of
a
pet
pigeon
i
grieved
for
days
over
its
disappearance
but
one
sunday
morning
the
secret
slipped
out
around
that
neighbourhood
there
was
a
custom
among
the
very
poor
of
exchanging
samples
of
their
sunday
broth
three
or
four
samples
came
to
our
cottage
every
sunday
morning
we
had
meat
once
a
week
and
then
it
was
either
the
hoofs
or
part
of
the
head
of
a
cow
or
the
same
parts
of
a
sheep
or
a
calf
on
this
particular
occasion
i
knew
that
there
was
something
in
our
broth
that
was
unusual
and
i
did
not
rest
until
i
learned
the
truth
they
had
grown
tired
of
nettle
broth
and
made
a
change
on
the
pigeon
there
was
a
pigsty
at
the
end
of
our
alley
against
the
gable
of
our
house
but
we
never
were
rich
enough
to
own
a
pig
one
of
my
earliest
recollections
is
of
extemporizing
out
of
the
pigsty
one
of
the
most
familiar
institutions
in
our
town
a
pawn
shop
if
anything
was
missing
in
the
house
they
could
usually
find
it
in
pawn
at
the
age
of
ten
i
entered
the
parochial
school
of
the
episcopal
church
but
the
pedagogue
of
that
period
delegated
his
pedagogy
to
a
monitor
and
the
monitor
to
one
of
the
biggest
boys
and
the
school
ran
itself
the
only
thing
i
remember
about
it
is
the
daily
rushes
over
the
benches
and
seats
and
the
number
of
boys
about
my
size
i
was
pitted
against
in
fistic
battles
at
the
close
of
my
first
school
day
i
came
home
with
one
of
my
eyes
discoloured
and
one
sleeve
torn
out
of
my
jacket
as
a
result
of
an
encounter
not
down
on
the
programme
the
ignominy
of
such
a
spectacle
irritated
my
father
and
i
was
thoroughly
whipped
for
my
inability
to
defend
myself
better
it
was
an
judgment
which
a
look
at
the
other
fellow
might
have
modified
after
a
few
weeks
at
school
i
begged
my
father
to
allow
me
to
devote
my
mornings
as
well
as
my
evenings
to
the
selling
of
newspapers
the
extra
work
added
a
little
to
my
income
and
preserved
my
looks
if
there
was
any
misery
in
my
life
at
this
time
i
neither
knew
nor
felt
it
i
was
living
the
life
of
the
average
boy
of
my
neighbourhood
and
had
nothing
to
complain
of
of
course
i
was
in
a
chronic
condition
of
hunger
but
so
was
every
other
boy
in
the
alley
and
on
the
street
it
was
quite
an
event
for
me
occasionally
to
go
with
the
son
of
the
chief
baker
of
the
town
he
usually
brought
a
loaf
along
as
toll
my
knowledge
of
the
woods
was
better
than
his
for
necessity
took
me
there
for
fuel
for
our
hearth
sometimes
the
baker
son
brought
a
companion
of
his
class
these
boys
were
and
and
it
was
when
we
spent
whole
days
together
that
i
noticed
the
disparity
they
were
quality
the
baker
was
called
wore
a
tall
hat
on
sundays
and
led
the
psalm
singing
in
the
presbyterian
church
in
the
summer
time
when
the
church
windows
were
open
the
leader
voice
could
be
heard
a
mile
away
my
childish
misgivings
about
the
distribution
of
the
good
things
of
life
were
quieted
in
the
sunday
school
by
the
dictum
it
is
the
will
of
god
my
first
knowledge
of
god
was
that
he
was
a
big
man
in
the
skies
who
dealt
out
to
the
church
people
good
things
and
to
others
experiences
to
make
them
good
the
bible
was
to
me
god
book
and
a
thing
to
be
handled
reverently
we
had
a
copy
but
it
was
coverless
loose
and
incomplete
every
morning
i
used
to
take
it
tenderly
in
my
hands
and
pretend
to
read
some
of
it
just
for
luck
my
sunday
school
teacher
informed
me
that
work
was
a
curse
that
god
had
put
upon
the
world
and
from
what
i
saw
around
me
i
naturally
concluded
that
life
was
more
of
a
curse
than
a
blessing
that
was
the
theory
my
father
however
never
seemed
to
be
able
to
get
enough
of
the
curse
to
appease
our
hunger
illustration
where
irvine
spent
his
boyhood
and
the
that
never
had
a
pig
the
lack
of
envy
did
not
prevent
an
occasional
questioning
of
god
arrangement
of
the
universe
occasionally
in
the
winter
time
when
my
feet
were
bleeding
cut
by
the
frozen
pavements
i
wondered
why
god
somehow
or
other
could
not
help
me
to
a
pair
of
shoes
nevertheless
i
reverently
worshipped
the
god
who
had
consigned
me
to
such
pitiless
and
poorly
paid
labour
and
believed
that
being
the
will
of
god
it
was
surely
for
my
best
good
my
first
hero
worship
came
to
me
while
a
newsboy
a
former
resident
of
the
town
had
returned
from
america
with
a
modicum
of
fame
he
had
left
a
labourer
and
returned
a
he
delivered
a
lecture
in
the
town
hall
and
out
of
curiosity
the
town
turned
out
to
hear
him
i
was
at
the
door
with
my
papers
it
was
a
very
cold
night
and
i
was
shivering
as
i
stood
on
one
foot
leaning
against
the
door
post
the
sole
of
the
other
foot
resting
upon
my
bare
leg
but
nobody
wanted
papers
at
a
lecture
the
doorkeeper
took
pity
upon
me
and
to
my
astonishment
invited
me
inside
there
on
a
bench
with
my
back
to
the
wall
and
my
feet
dangling
six
inches
from
the
floor
i
listened
to
a
lecture
about
a
it
took
me
many
years
to
find
out
what
a
was
but
the
name
was
lincoln
and
he
became
my
first
hero
from
the
selling
of
papers
on
the
streets
of
antrim
i
went
to
work
on
a
farm
the
owner
of
which
was
a
member
of
parliament
for
our
county
one
james
chaine
by
name
my
first
work
on
the
farm
was
the
keeping
of
crows
off
the
potato
crop
technically
speaking
i
was
a
scarecrow
it
was
in
the
autumn
and
the
potatoes
were
ripe
i
was
permitted
to
help
myself
to
them
so
three
times
a
day
i
made
a
fire
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
roasted
as
many
potatoes
as
i
could
eat
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
enjoyed
the
pleasure
of
a
full
meal
in
the
solitude
of
the
potato
field
came
my
first
vision
i
was
a
firm
believer
in
the
wee
people
but
my
visions
were
not
entirely
peopled
with
fairies
the
life
of
the
woods
was
very
fascinating
to
me
i
enjoyed
the
birds
and
the
wild
flowers
and
the
sportive
rabbits
of
which
the
woods
were
full
the
bell
which
closed
the
labourer
day
was
always
an
unwelcome
sound
to
me
after
the
ingathering
of
the
potato
crop
i
was
given
work
in
the
farmyard
attending
to
horses
and
cattle
as
jack
of
all
jobs
in
the
spring
of
the
following
year
i
went
again
to
work
in
the
potato
field
and
later
to
care
for
the
crop
as
before
it
was
during
my
second
autumn
as
a
scarecrow
that
i
had
an
experience
which
changed
the
current
of
my
life
it
was
on
a
monday
and
during
the
entire
day
i
kept
humming
over
and
over
two
lines
of
a
hymn
i
had
heard
in
the
sunday
school
nothing
ever
happened
to
me
that
remains
quite
so
vividly
in
my
mind
as
that
experience
i
was
sitting
on
the
fence
at
the
close
of
the
day
a
very
happy
day
i
must
have
been
moved
by
the
colour
of
the
sky
or
by
the
emotion
produced
by
the
lines
of
the
hymn
it
may
have
been
both
but
as
i
sat
on
the
fence
and
watched
the
sun
set
over
the
trees
an
emotion
swept
over
me
and
the
tears
began
to
flow
my
body
seemed
to
change
as
by
the
pouring
into
it
of
some
strange
fluid
i
wanted
to
shout
to
scream
aloud
but
instead
i
went
rapidly
over
the
hill
into
the
woods
dropped
on
my
knees
and
began
to
pray
it
was
getting
dark
but
the
woods
were
filled
with
light
perhaps
it
was
the
light
of
my
vision
or
the
light
of
my
mind
i
know
not
but
when
i
came
back
into
the
open
i
felt
as
though
i
were
walking
on
air
as
i
passed
through
the
farmyard
i
came
in
contact
with
some
of
the
men
and
their
questions
led
me
to
believe
that
some
of
the
experience
remained
on
my
face
but
i
naïvely
set
aside
their
questions
and
passed
on
down
the
country
road
to
the
town
that
night
as
i
climbed
to
the
little
loft
i
realized
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
i
had
never
slept
in
a
bed
but
on
a
pallet
of
straw
my
bed
covering
was
composed
of
old
gunny
sacks
sewed
together
and
automatically
when
i
took
my
clothes
off
i
made
a
pillow
of
them
many
a
night
i
had
been
kept
awake
by
the
gnawing
pangs
of
hunger
but
this
night
i
was
kept
awake
for
a
different
reason
it
was
an
indescribable
ecstasy
a
joy
as
i
lay
there
with
my
head
about
a
foot
from
the
thatched
roof
i
hummed
over
and
over
again
the
two
lines
of
the
hymn
sometimes
breaking
the
continuity
in
giving
way
to
tears
the
second
revelation
came
to
me
the
following
morning
i
realized
the
condition
of
my
body
i
was
in
rags
and
dirty
i
shook
my
mother
out
of
her
slumber
and
begged
her
to
help
me
sew
up
the
rents
in
my
clothes
i
had
no
shoes
but
i
carefully
washed
my
feet
combed
my
tousled
unkempt
hair
and
took
great
pains
in
the
washing
of
my
face
all
of
this
was
a
mystery
to
my
mother
she
wanted
to
know
what
had
happened
to
me
and
a
very
unusual
thing
ended
the
preparations
for
the
day
my
mother
said
i
looked
purty
and
kissed
me
as
i
went
out
of
the
door
as
i
walked
up
the
street
that
morning
i
shared
my
joy
with
the
first
living
thing
i
met
the
old
dog
rover
i
shook
his
paw
and
said
morrow
rover
everything
looked
beautiful
the
world
was
full
of
joy
i
was
perfectly
sure
that
the
birds
were
sharing
it
for
they
sang
that
morning
as
i
had
never
heard
them
sing
before
i
resolved
to
let
at
least
one
person
into
the
secret
i
was
sure
that
my
sister
would
understand
me
she
used
to
visit
me
every
noon
hour
on
the
pretence
of
bringing
my
dinner
we
had
a
secret
compact
that
whether
there
was
any
dinner
to
bring
or
not
she
should
come
with
a
bowl
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
cloth
as
was
the
custom
with
other
sisters
and
wives
there
was
a
straight
stretch
of
road
a
mile
long
and
as
i
sat
on
the
roadside
watching
for
her
i
could
tell
a
mile
off
whether
she
had
any
dinner
or
not
when
there
was
anything
in
the
bowl
she
carried
it
steadily
when
empty
she
would
swing
it
like
a
censer
when
i
told
my
sister
about
these
strange
happenings
of
the
heart
she
looked
very
anxiously
into
my
eyes
and
said
i
just
think
ye
goin
mad
before
leaving
the
farm
i
experienced
an
incident
which
although
of
a
different
character
equalled
in
its
intensity
and
beauty
my
awakening
to
what
for
lack
of
a
better
term
i
called
a
religious
life
a
young
lady
from
the
city
was
visiting
at
the
home
of
the
land
steward
and
as
i
knew
more
about
the
woods
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
than
anybody
else
on
the
farm
i
was
often
ordered
to
take
visitors
around
the
land
steward
daughter
accompanied
the
young
lady
on
her
first
visit
to
the
roads
but
afterward
she
came
alone
and
we
traversed
the
ravine
from
one
end
to
the
other
we
collected
flowers
and
specimens
and
watched
the
wild
animals
i
had
never
seen
such
a
beautiful
human
being
her
voice
was
soft
and
musical
she
wore
her
hair
loosely
down
her
back
and
was
a
perfect
picture
of
health
and
beauty
one
day
i
lay
at
full
length
on
my
back
asleep
by
the
edge
of
the
wood
when
i
awoke
this
city
girl
was
standing
at
my
side
i
jumped
to
my
feet
and
stood
erect
and
i
remember
distinctly
the
emotions
that
swept
through
me
i
was
startled
at
first
startled
as
i
had
been
on
a
previous
occasion
when
at
a
sharp
turn
in
the
footpath
in
the
ravine
i
met
a
fawn
i
remembered
my
first
impulse
then
was
for
a
word
a
word
of
conciliation
for
i
was
fascinated
by
the
beauty
of
the
graceful
beast
graceful
as
a
nymph
it
stood
there
nerves
strained
like
a
bow
bent
for
the
discharge
of
an
arrow
its
head
poised
in
air
fire
shooting
from
its
eyes
it
remained
only
for
an
instant
and
then
with
a
frightened
plunge
it
cleared
the
clump
of
laurel
bushes
and
disappeared
when
i
stood
before
this
beautiful
city
girl
i
remembered
the
fawn
and
expected
the
girl
instantly
to
vanish
out
of
my
sight
there
was
something
of
the
fawn
in
her
graceful
form
some
of
the
fire
in
her
blue
eyes
and
in
her
girlish
laugh
a
suggestion
of
the
freedom
of
the
mountain
and
glen
i
think
it
was
in
that
moment
of
intensity
that
i
crossed
the
bridge
which
separates
the
boy
from
the
man
an
impassable
gulf
was
fixed
between
this
girl
station
in
life
and
mine
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
florist
and
i
was
the
son
of
a
cobbler
she
returned
home
shortly
after
this
and
i
was
promoted
from
the
potato
field
to
be
a
groom
helper
in
the
stables
of
the
master
we
called
his
residence
the
big
house
it
was
like
a
castle
on
the
rhine
a
very
wonderful
man
was
this
member
of
parliament
to
the
labourers
around
on
his
demesne
not
the
least
part
of
this
wonder
consisted
in
the
tradition
that
he
had
a
different
suit
of
clothes
for
every
day
in
the
year
he
was
very
fond
of
fine
horses
and
gloried
in
the
fact
that
he
owned
a
winner
of
the
derby
he
kept
a
large
stable
of
racing
hunting
and
carriage
horses
this
was
the
advent
of
a
new
life
to
me
i
was
taken
in
hand
by
the
head
groom
and
fitted
out
with
two
suits
of
clothes
and
in
this
change
the
first
great
ambition
of
my
life
was
satisfied
i
became
the
possessor
of
a
hard
hat
for
two
years
i
had
instinctively
longed
for
something
on
my
head
that
i
could
politely
remove
to
a
lady
the
first
night
i
marched
down
that
village
street
shoes
well
polished
starched
linen
and
hard
hat
i
expected
the
whole
town
to
be
there
to
see
me
i
had
made
several
attempts
at
this
hat
business
before
they
organized
a
flute
band
in
the
town
and
i
joined
it
for
the
sake
of
the
hat
but
it
was
too
nice
a
thing
to
be
lying
around
when
people
were
hungry
and
as
it
was
in
pawn
most
of
the
time
i
finally
redeemed
it
returned
it
and
quit
but
this
time
the
hat
had
come
to
stay
with
my
new
vision
still
warm
in
my
heart
i
became
very
active
in
the
parish
sunday
school
my
inability
to
read
relegated
me
to
the
children
class
but
i
had
a
retentive
memory
and
before
i
was
able
to
read
i
memorized
about
three
hundred
texts
from
the
bible
the
first
outworking
of
my
vision
was
on
a
drunken
stone
mason
of
our
town
his
family
relatives
and
friends
had
all
given
him
up
he
had
given
himself
up
i
went
after
him
every
night
for
weeks
talked
to
him
pleaded
with
him
prayed
for
him
and
was
rewarded
by
seeing
him
make
a
new
start
together
we
organized
a
temperance
society
i
think
it
was
the
first
temperance
society
in
that
town
i
was
much
more
at
home
in
this
kind
of
work
than
in
the
sunday
school
for
while
i
could
be
neither
secretary
treasurer
nor
president
of
the
temperance
society
i
had
organized
my
inability
to
read
or
write
did
not
prevent
me
from
hustling
after
such
men
as
my
first
convert
in
the
sunday
school
i
felt
keenly
the
fact
that
i
was
outclassed
by
boys
half
my
age
but
i
persevered
and
went
from
one
class
to
another
until
i
had
gone
through
the
grades
and
was
then
given
the
opportunity
to
organize
a
class
of
my
own
this
i
did
with
the
material
on
the
streets
children
unconnected
with
any
school
or
institution
i
taught
them
the
bible
stories
and
helped
them
to
memorize
the
texts
that
i
had
learned
myself
despite
the
fact
that
i
was
now
clean
and
well
groomed
i
could
not
help
comparing
my
life
to
the
life
of
the
horses
i
was
attending
especially
with
regard
to
their
sleeping
accommodations
the
slightest
speck
of
dirt
of
any
kind
around
their
bedding
was
an
indictment
of
the
grooming
the
stables
were
beautifully
flagged
and
sprinkled
with
fine
white
sand
the
mangers
were
kept
cleaner
than
anything
in
the
houses
of
the
poor
and
when
i
trotted
a
mount
out
into
the
yard
the
master
would
take
out
his
white
silk
handkerchief
run
it
along
the
horse
side
and
then
examine
it
if
the
handkerchief
was
soiled
in
the
slightest
degree
the
horse
was
sent
back
probably
not
once
in
a
year
was
a
horse
returned
under
such
circumstances
the
regularity
of
meals
was
another
point
of
comparison
and
the
daily
washings
brushings
groomings
it
meant
something
to
be
a
horse
in
that
stable
much
more
than
it
meant
to
be
a
groom
when
these
points
of
comparison
arose
i
pushed
them
back
as
evil
and
discontent
with
the
will
of
god
this
master
man
used
to
talk
to
his
horses
but
he
seldom
talked
to
his
grooms
sometimes
i
was
permitted
the
luxury
of
a
look
at
the
great
or
the
that
also
was
another
world
to
me
a
world
of
beauty
for
god
good
people
even
the
butlers
footmen
and
other
flunkies
were
superior
people
and
i
envied
them
not
only
the
uniform
of
their
servitude
but
their
intimate
touch
with
that
inner
world
of
beautiful
things
i
spent
one
winter
at
the
big
house
and
then
the
shame
of
my
ignorance
drove
me
forever
from
the
haunts
of
my
childhood
i
entered
the
city
of
belfast
seventeen
miles
distant
and
became
coachman
and
groom
to
a
man
who
by
the
selling
of
clothes
had
reached
the
economic
status
of
owning
a
horse
in
adapting
himself
to
this
new
condition
he
dressed
me
in
livery
and
after
i
had
taught
him
to
drive
i
sat
beside
him
in
the
buggy
with
folded
arms
arrayed
in
a
tall
hat
with
a
cockade
the
wages
in
this
new
position
were
so
small
that
when
i
had
paid
for
my
room
and
meagre
board
i
had
nothing
left
for
the
support
of
my
brothers
and
sisters
who
were
still
in
dire
poverty
the
young
lady
i
had
met
on
the
farm
lived
in
this
city
and
in
my
neighbourhood
but
i
would
have
considered
it
a
matter
of
gross
discourtesy
to
call
on
her
or
indeed
do
anything
save
lift
my
hat
if
i
met
her
on
the
street
our
social
stations
were
so
far
apart
but
she
had
told
me
the
name
of
the
church
she
attended
and
as
i
was
thinking
more
about
her
at
that
time
than
about
anybody
else
i
stole
quietly
into
the
church
as
soon
as
the
doors
were
opened
and
ensconcing
myself
in
a
corner
under
the
gallery
i
scanned
the
faces
eagerly
as
they
came
in
from
that
obscure
point
i
saw
the
young
lady
once
a
week
at
the
end
of
three
months
her
family
came
without
her
the
third
sunday
of
her
absence
i
was
almost
on
the
point
of
asking
about
her
but
i
mastered
the
desire
held
my
station
and
went
to
scotland
where
i
entered
a
as
a
helper
to
one
of
my
brothers
my
pay
for
twelve
hours
a
day
was
a
dollar
and
fifty
cents
a
week
if
i
had
not
been
living
in
the
same
house
with
my
brother
this
would
not
have
sustained
me
in
physical
efficiency
the
contrast
between
my
life
as
a
groom
and
this
blackened
underworld
was
very
marked
and
i
did
not
at
all
relish
it
we
were
all
men
and
boys
and
sometimes
girls
reduced
to
the
common
level
of
blackened
humans
with
about
two
garments
each
the
coal
dust
covered
my
skin
like
a
garment
and
coal
was
part
of
every
mouthful
of
food
i
ate
in
that
fetid
atmosphere
i
had
a
powerful
body
that
defied
the
dangers
of
the
pit
but
the
labour
was
exhausting
and
my
face
was
blistered
every
day
with
the
hot
oil
dripping
from
the
lamp
on
my
brow
sometimes
i
lay
flat
on
my
back
and
worked
with
a
at
the
coal
overhead
sometimes
i
pushed
long
distances
a
thing
called
a
hutch
filled
with
coal
i
left
my
brother
pit
with
the
hope
of
getting
a
larger
wage
but
there
was
very
little
difference
between
the
pits
everywhere
i
went
labour
and
wages
were
about
the
same
everywhere
life
had
the
same
dull
monotonous
round
it
was
a
writhing
squirming
mass
of
blackened
humanity
struggling
for
a
mere
physical
existence
a
bare
living
the
desire
to
learn
to
read
and
write
returned
to
me
with
renewed
intensity
and
gave
me
keen
discontent
with
the
life
in
the
pits
at
the
same
time
the
spiritual
ideal
sustained
me
in
the
upward
look
there
was
just
ahead
of
me
a
and
my
was
bringing
an
escape
from
this
drudgery
i
exulted
in
the
thought
of
the
future
i
could
sing
and
laugh
in
anticipation
of
it
even
though
i
lived
and
worked
like
a
beast
i
was
conscious
that
in
me
resided
a
power
that
would
ultimately
take
me
to
a
life
that
i
had
had
a
little
taste
of
a
life
where
people
had
time
to
think
and
to
live
a
clean
normal
human
life
i
do
not
remember
anything
about
labour
unions
in
that
coal
region
if
there
were
any
i
did
not
know
of
them
i
was
not
asked
to
join
in
those
same
pits
and
at
that
same
time
worked
keir
hardie
and
wee
keir
was
just
beginning
to
move
the
sluggish
souls
of
his
fellow
labourers
to
improve
their
condition
by
collective
effort
my
ideal
did
not
lead
me
in
that
direction
i
was
struggling
to
get
into
the
other
world
for
another
reason
i
wanted
to
live
a
religious
life
i
wanted
to
move
men
souls
as
i
had
moved
the
soul
of
the
drunken
stone
mason
in
my
home
town
i
made
various
attempts
to
learn
to
read
but
each
of
them
failed
i
was
so
exhausted
at
the
close
of
the
day
work
that
i
usually
lay
down
in
the
corner
without
even
washing
sometimes
i
pulled
myself
together
and
went
out
into
the
village
praying
as
i
went
that
by
some
miracle
or
other
i
should
find
a
teacher
sometimes
i
made
excursions
into
the
city
of
glasgow
one
night
i
wandered
accidentally
into
a
mission
in
possilpark
where
a
congregation
of
miners
was
listening
to
a
tall
young
preacher
i
had
not
sufficient
energy
to
keep
awake
so
promptly
went
to
sleep
i
awoke
at
a
gentle
shake
from
the
hand
of
the
teacher
i
returned
but
succeeded
no
better
in
keeping
awake
i
returned
again
and
the
teacher
when
he
learned
of
my
ambition
advised
me
to
leave
the
pits
entirely
and
seek
for
something
else
to
do
there
was
something
magnetic
in
that
strong
right
hand
something
musical
and
inspiring
in
that
wonderful
voice
and
just
when
i
was
about
to
sink
back
in
despair
and
resign
myself
perhaps
for
years
to
the
inevitable
this
man
influence
pushed
me
out
into
a
new
venture
the
teacher
was
professor
henry
drummond
trusting
to
luck
or
god
or
the
power
of
my
hands
i
entered
the
great
smoky
dirty
city
of
glasgow
to
look
for
a
job
i
considered
it
a
great
shame
to
be
without
one
and
a
crime
to
be
prowling
the
city
at
night
homeless
and
workless
god
at
this
time
was
a
very
real
person
to
me
and
i
spent
the
greater
part
of
many
a
night
on
my
knees
in
some
alley
or
down
by
the
docks
praying
for
a
chance
to
work
to
be
clean
to
learn
to
read
i
slept
one
night
in
a
large
box
on
one
of
the
docks
and
in
searching
for
a
place
in
the
box
to
lay
my
head
i
laid
my
hand
on
another
human
and
at
daylight
discovered
him
to
be
a
youth
of
about
my
own
age
we
exchanged
experiences
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
outlined
a
programme
and
having
none
of
my
own
i
dropped
naturally
into
his
he
conducted
me
to
a
quarter
of
the
city
where
the
recruiting
officers
parade
the
streets
gayly
attired
in
their
attractive
uniforms
we
accosted
one
man
who
had
the
special
attraction
of
a
large
bunch
of
gay
ribbons
flying
from
his
glengarry
cap
we
passed
the
physical
examination
took
the
shilling
and
were
drafted
first
to
london
then
to
a
training
depot
in
the
south
of
kent
chapter
ii
the
beginning
of
an
education
the
first
discovery
i
made
in
the
training
depot
was
that
i
had
not
as
i
supposed
joined
the
army
at
all
but
the
navy
i
was
a
marine
but
there
was
no
disappointment
in
the
discovery
for
i
saw
in
the
marine
service
a
better
opportunity
to
see
the
world
here
at
last
was
my
school
and
schooling
was
a
part
of
the
daily
routine
in
the
daily
exercises
of
the
gymnasium
i
was
made
to
feel
very
keenly
by
the
instructors
the
awkwardness
of
my
body
but
i
was
so
thrilled
with
the
joy
of
the
that
it
took
a
good
deal
of
forcing
to
interest
me
in
the
handling
of
guns
bayonets
the
swinging
of
clubs
vaulting
of
horses
and
other
gymnasium
exercises
i
could
think
only
in
the
terms
of
the
education
i
most
keenly
desired
this
was
my
first
source
of
trouble
whatever
else
a
soldier
may
be
he
is
a
soldier
first
his
chief
business
in
life
is
to
be
a
killer
a
strong
intelligent
professional
killer
and
nearly
all
energies
of
instruction
are
bent
to
give
him
that
kind
of
power
the
depot
is
on
the
edge
of
the
sea
and
the
sea
breezes
with
six
hours
a
day
of
drill
gave
me
as
it
gives
all
recruits
at
that
stage
an
abnormal
appetite
so
that
the
most
of
the
queen
pay
went
for
additional
rations
i
made
rapid
progress
in
school
and
i
attended
all
lectures
prayer
meetings
religious
assemblies
and
social
gatherings
to
exercise
a
talent
which
i
already
possessed
of
giving
voice
to
my
religious
beliefs
but
my
irish
dialect
was
badly
out
of
place
and
it
took
a
good
deal
of
courage
to
take
part
in
these
things
but
more
embarrassing
than
my
attempts
at
public
speech
were
my
attempts
to
keep
up
with
my
squad
in
the
gymnasium
and
on
the
parade
ground
my
fellow
recruits
were
thinking
in
the
terms
of
drill
only
and
i
was
thinking
in
the
terms
of
my
opportunity
for
an
education
my
awkwardness
made
me
the
subject
of
much
ridicule
and
jest
it
also
earned
for
me
a
brief
sojourn
in
the
awkward
squad
the
gymnasium
was
open
every
evening
for
exercise
and
amusement
the
first
time
i
ventured
in
to
get
a
little
extra
drill
on
my
own
account
i
had
an
experience
of
a
kind
that
one
is
not
likely
to
forget
my
drill
sergeant
happened
to
be
there
i
saw
him
engaged
in
a
whispered
conference
with
one
of
the
gymnasium
instructors
a
few
minutes
later
the
instructor
came
to
me
and
urged
me
to
enter
the
boxing
contest
which
was
going
on
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
which
was
the
favourite
amusement
of
the
evening
i
had
no
desire
for
such
amusement
and
frankly
told
him
so
but
he
was
not
to
be
put
off
he
said
there
is
a
rule
of
the
gym
that
men
who
come
here
in
the
evening
who
are
very
largely
given
their
own
way
are
nevertheless
obliged
to
do
what
they
are
told
and
you
may
escape
serious
trouble
by
attending
to
my
orders
i
still
demurred
but
was
forced
to
the
ring
side
a
roped
enclosure
with
a
pair
of
boxing
gloves
and
an
instructor
to
take
care
of
the
proceedings
when
the
gloves
were
fastened
on
my
hands
i
noticed
that
my
opponent
was
one
of
the
assistant
instructors
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
was
in
for
a
thrashing
and
i
certainly
was
they
must
have
made
up
their
minds
that
a
good
thrashing
would
wake
me
up
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
parade
ground
and
the
assistant
instructor
proceeded
to
administer
it
i
knew
nothing
whatever
of
boxing
and
could
put
up
but
a
weak
defence
i
was
knocked
down
several
times
one
of
my
eyes
partly
closed
and
my
nose
smashed
and
one
of
my
arms
rendered
almost
useless
when
away
from
the
gymnasium
at
my
that
night
i
did
some
hard
thinking
a
whose
cot
was
next
to
mine
was
something
of
a
boxer
he
possessed
two
pairs
of
gloves
he
had
often
urged
me
to
accommodate
him
as
an
opponent
but
i
had
steadily
refused
on
learning
of
my
plight
he
laughed
loudly
so
did
my
other
as
they
learned
of
it
that
night
before
taps
i
bound
myself
to
an
arrangement
by
which
i
was
to
pay
my
of
my
regimental
pay
per
week
for
instruction
in
handling
the
gloves
he
gave
me
an
hour
each
night
for
six
weeks
at
the
end
of
the
first
week
i
had
gained
an
advantage
over
him
i
had
a
very
long
reach
and
a
body
as
lithe
as
a
panther
i
gave
up
prayer
meetings
lectures
and
socials
and
devoted
my
self
religiously
to
what
is
called
the
noble
art
of
if
my
drill
sergeant
imagined
that
a
thrashing
would
wake
me
up
he
was
a
very
good
judge
it
did
incidentally
it
woke
others
up
too
it
woke
my
new
instructor
up
and
half
a
dozen
of
my
at
the
end
of
my
six
weeks
training
by
dint
of
perseverance
and
application
to
the
thing
in
hand
i
had
succeeded
in
this
new
type
of
education
thrust
upon
me
during
all
this
time
i
had
not
visited
the
gymnasium
in
the
evening
but
was
remembered
there
by
all
who
had
noticed
the
process
of
my
awakening
one
night
i
modestly
approached
the
chief
instructor
and
asked
him
if
i
might
not
have
another
lesson
by
the
man
who
had
taught
me
the
first
he
remembered
the
occasion
and
laughed
laughed
at
the
memory
of
it
and
laughed
at
the
brogue
and
what
he
supposed
to
be
the
temerity
of
my
asking
in
asking
i
had
made
my
brogue
just
a
little
thicker
and
my
manner
just
as
diffident
and
modest
as
possible
oh
certainly
he
replied
chuckling
to
himself
the
man
who
gave
me
my
first
lesson
a
man
of
my
own
build
and
height
appeared
also
laughing
as
he
noticed
who
the
applicant
for
another
lesson
was
my
instructor
was
on
hand
also
for
i
had
confidentially
communicated
to
him
that
evening
my
intention
to
try
again
there
is
something
fiendish
in
the
celtic
nature
some
beast
in
the
blood
which
when
aroused
is
exceedingly
helpful
in
matters
of
this
kind
in
less
than
sixty
seconds
i
had
demonstrated
to
the
onlookers
and
particularly
to
my
opponent
that
i
had
been
to
school
since
last
meeting
him
i
had
not
been
particular
about
fancy
touches
or
the
pointless
gingerbread
style
of
showing
off
before
a
crowd
there
was
a
positive
viciousness
in
my
attack
which
was
perfectly
legitimate
in
such
circumstances
but
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
felt
the
beast
in
my
blood
and
i
turned
him
loose
and
if
i
had
been
made
prime
minister
of
england
by
a
miracle
i
could
not
have
felt
part
of
the
pride
that
i
did
when
inside
of
the
first
thirty
seconds
i
had
stretched
my
instructor
on
his
back
at
my
feet
and
in
the
absolute
joyfulness
and
ecstasy
of
my
soul
i
yelled
at
the
top
of
my
voice
hurry
up
ye
spalpeen
till
i
knock
yez
down
again
the
man
got
up
and
was
somewhat
more
cautious
but
utterly
unprepared
to
be
completely
mastered
at
his
own
game
in
five
minutes
and
when
the
chief
instructor
interfered
and
ordered
his
assistant
out
of
the
ring
i
begged
for
more
and
so
a
fresh
man
was
put
in
and
another
and
another
until
six
men
had
failed
to
tire
me
or
to
disturb
me
in
the
least
after
the
first
two
i
laughed
laughed
loudly
in
the
midst
of
my
aggressive
work
and
enjoyed
it
every
moment
of
the
time
and
when
occasionally
i
was
the
recipient
of
a
stinging
blow
it
merely
added
to
my
zest
next
morning
i
found
myself
a
hero
in
the
course
of
the
night
i
had
become
famous
in
a
small
circle
as
a
bruiser
in
accomplishing
this
i
had
thrown
aside
for
the
time
being
my
religious
scruples
on
the
question
of
boxing
not
only
on
boxing
but
fighting
and
i
had
set
aside
a
good
deal
of
my
prejudice
in
my
struggle
for
an
education
and
my
success
in
the
thing
i
started
out
to
do
almost
unbalanced
me
i
had
for
the
first
few
days
after
this
encounter
a
terrific
struggle
a
struggle
of
the
human
soul
between
my
character
and
my
reputation
only
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
men
saw
the
encounter
but
before
parade
time
next
morning
fifteen
hundred
men
were
acquainted
with
it
it
had
reached
the
officers
mess
and
as
i
went
back
and
forth
i
was
pointed
out
as
the
new
discovery
i
finally
reached
a
state
of
mind
that
filled
me
with
disgust
and
i
took
an
afternoon
stroll
down
the
road
to
walmer
castle
and
just
opposite
the
window
of
the
room
in
which
the
duke
of
wellington
died
on
the
sands
of
deal
beach
i
knelt
on
my
knees
and
promised
god
that
i
wud
put
th
dhirty
gloves
on
again
and
i
kept
the
promise
while
in
the
training
depot
early
in
i
was
drafted
to
headquarters
near
london
a
trained
soldier
my
forenoons
were
spent
in
parades
drills
fatigue
and
other
duties
in
the
afternoons
i
continued
my
studies
i
entered
into
religious
work
with
renewed
vigour
connecting
myself
with
a
small
independent
church
not
far
from
the
barracks
my
thick
irish
brogue
militated
against
my
usefulness
in
the
church
and
in
expressing
myself
with
warmth
i
usually
made
it
worse
in
the
my
brogue
brought
me
several
irish
nicknames
which
irritated
me
they
were
names
usually
attached
to
the
roman
catholic
irish
and
having
been
brought
up
in
an
ulster
community
where
part
of
a
education
is
to
hate
roman
catholics
i
naturally
resented
these
names
a
protestant
irishman
will
tolerate
pat
but
mick
will
put
him
in
a
fighting
attitude
in
a
moment
the
only
way
out
of
the
difficulty
was
to
rid
myself
of
the
brogue
and
this
i
proceeded
to
do
all
around
me
were
cockney
englishmen
murdering
the
queen
english
and
scotchmen
who
were
doing
worse
i
had
not
yet
become
the
possessor
of
a
dictionary
and
my
chief
instructors
in
language
and
particularly
pronunciation
and
enunciation
were
preachers
and
lecturers
with
regard
to
literature
i
was
like
a
man
lost
in
a
forest
i
had
no
guide
one
night
i
attended
a
lecture
by
kirton
the
author
of
a
tract
called
buy
your
own
cherries
this
tract
my
mother
had
read
to
me
when
a
boy
and
it
had
made
a
very
profound
impression
upon
me
the
author
was
very
kind
gave
me
an
interview
and
advised
me
to
read
as
my
first
novel
john
halifax
gentleman
inside
of
a
week
i
had
read
the
book
twice
the
second
time
with
dictionary
and
pencil
the
story
fascinated
me
and
the
way
in
which
it
was
told
opened
up
new
channels
of
improvement
i
memorized
whole
pages
of
it
and
even
took
long
walks
by
the
seaside
repeating
over
and
over
what
i
had
memorized
the
enlargement
of
my
opportunities
in
garrison
life
revealed
to
me
something
of
the
amount
of
work
required
to
accomplish
my
purpose
in
the
midst
of
people
who
had
merely
an
ordinary
grammar
school
education
i
felt
like
a
child
when
discouragement
came
i
took
refuge
in
the
fact
that
several
avenues
of
usefulness
were
open
to
me
in
army
life
i
had
shown
some
proficiency
in
gunnery
for
a
steady
plodder
who
attends
strictly
to
business
there
is
always
promotion
as
a
flunky
there
was
the
incentive
of
double
pay
the
wearing
of
plain
clothes
and
some
intimate
touch
with
the
aristocracy
many
a
time
one
of
these
avenues
seemed
the
only
career
open
for
me
i
hardly
knew
what
an
education
meant
but
whatever
it
meant
it
was
a
long
way
off
and
almost
out
of
reach
one
day
in
going
over
my
john
halifax
i
came
across
this
passage
would
you
do
john
if
you
were
shut
up
here
and
had
to
get
over
the
yew
hedge
you
could
not
climb
it
know
that
and
therefore
i
should
not
waste
time
in
trying
you
give
up
then
he
smiled
there
was
no
up
in
that
smile
of
his
tell
you
what
i
do
i
begin
and
break
it
twig
by
twig
till
i
forced
my
way
through
and
got
out
safe
at
the
other
side
this
was
a
new
inspiration
the
difficulty
was
not
lessened
by
the
inspiration
but
a
new
method
appealed
to
me
it
was
the
patient
plodding
method
of
twig
by
twig
the
quotation
from
john
halifax
was
reinforced
by
one
of
the
first
things
i
ever
read
of
browning
that
low
man
seeks
a
little
thing
to
do
sees
it
and
does
it
this
high
man
with
a
great
thing
to
pursue
dies
ere
he
knows
it
that
low
man
goes
on
adding
one
to
one
his
hundred
soon
hit
this
high
man
aiming
at
a
million
misses
an
unit
the
most
powerful
speaker
i
ever
heard
was
charles
bradlaugh
i
attended
one
of
his
lectures
one
sunday
afternoon
in
a
large
auditorium
in
portsmouth
i
shall
never
forget
that
wonderful
voice
as
it
thrilled
an
audience
of
four
thousand
people
bradlaugh
was
engaged
in
one
of
his
favourite
themes
demolishing
god
and
the
theologians
it
was
the
most
daring
thing
i
had
ever
heard
and
my
mind
and
soul
were
in
revolt
when
the
time
for
questions
came
i
pushed
my
way
to
the
front
was
recognized
by
the
chairman
and
mounted
the
platform
my
lips
were
parched
and
i
could
scarcely
utter
a
word
the
big
man
with
the
homely
face
saw
my
embarrassment
and
said
take
your
time
my
boy
do
be
in
a
hurry
he
had
been
a
soldier
himself
and
i
supposed
as
i
stood
there
in
my
scarlet
tunic
glengarry
cap
in
hand
bradlaugh
became
reminiscent
when
i
got
command
of
my
voice
i
said
i
want
to
ask
bradlaugh
a
question
i
have
very
little
education
and
little
opportunity
to
get
more
but
i
have
a
peace
in
my
heart
i
call
it
in
god
i
do
know
what
else
to
call
it
and
i
want
to
ask
bradlaugh
whether
he
is
willing
to
take
that
away
from
me
and
deprive
me
of
the
biggest
pleasure
in
my
life
and
leave
nothing
in
its
place
he
rose
from
his
chair
came
forward
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
amid
a
most
impressive
silence
said
no
my
lad
charles
bradlaugh
will
be
the
last
man
on
the
face
of
the
earth
to
take
a
pleasure
from
a
soldier
boy
even
though
it
be
a
in
god
the
crowd
wildly
cheered
and
i
went
out
grateful
and
strengthened
this
incident
had
a
very
unusual
effect
upon
me
an
intense
desire
to
tell
others
of
that
belief
possessed
me
i
was
already
doing
this
in
a
small
way
but
i
became
bolder
and
sought
larger
opportunities
about
ten
days
later
i
was
ordered
to
london
as
the
personal
bearer
of
a
government
dispatch
i
made
requisition
for
seven
days
leave
of
absence
my
mission
was
to
the
horse
guards
and
after
its
accomplishment
i
went
to
whitechapel
and
rented
a
small
room
for
a
week
i
had
with
me
a
suit
of
plain
clothes
that
i
wore
during
the
daytime
but
the
scarlet
uniform
was
conspicuous
and
soldier
evangelists
very
rare
so
in
the
mission
halls
and
on
the
street
corners
with
the
salvation
army
and
other
preachers
i
exercised
my
one
talent
and
told
the
story
of
what
i
had
now
found
a
name
for
my
conversion
in
the
daytime
i
talked
to
costermongers
street
venders
the
unemployed
and
the
corner
loafers
one
night
i
put
my
plain
clothes
on
and
spent
the
night
with
the
wharf
rats
on
the
banks
of
the
thames
for
seven
days
and
for
seven
nights
i
continuously
told
that
simple
story
told
it
in
few
words
closing
always
with
an
appeal
for
a
change
of
life
i
had
spoken
to
the
officer
of
the
horse
guards
with
whom
i
had
business
of
my
intention
and
he
told
me
of
a
brother
officer
who
was
very
much
interested
in
religious
work
among
soldiers
and
directed
me
to
his
quarters
the
interview
resulted
in
an
invitation
to
a
sunday
afternoon
meeting
at
the
town
house
of
a
duke
it
was
the
most
gorgeous
place
i
had
ever
been
in
and
the
audience
was
composed
of
the
most
aristocratic
people
in
london
i
felt
very
much
out
of
place
and
conspicuous
because
of
my
uniform
and
station
in
life
the
first
part
of
the
meeting
partook
of
the
nature
of
a
reception
i
watched
the
proceedings
from
the
most
obscure
corner
i
could
find
somebody
rapped
on
the
table
the
hum
of
voices
ceased
and
there
stepped
out
as
the
speaker
of
the
afternoon
my
friend
of
the
possilpark
mission
professor
drummond
up
to
that
hour
my
theology
related
largely
to
another
world
but
his
explanation
of
a
portion
of
scripture
was
so
clear
and
so
convincing
to
my
simple
mind
that
i
could
neither
miss
its
meaning
nor
avoid
its
application
the
professor
was
telling
us
that
religion
must
be
related
to
life
many
years
afterward
i
came
across
the
treatise
in
printed
form
it
was
entitled
the
programme
of
christianity
the
officer
of
the
horse
guards
by
whose
invitation
i
enjoyed
this
privilege
introduced
me
to
the
lecturer
and
this
personal
touch
though
very
slight
marked
a
distinct
period
in
my
development
drummond
had
pushed
me
out
of
one
stage
and
by
inviting
me
to
render
an
account
of
myself
to
him
inspired
me
into
another
my
bible
studies
had
given
me
a
longing
to
see
the
holy
land
perhaps
the
longing
was
by
the
possibility
of
being
drafted
to
the
mediterranean
squadron
on
inquiry
i
learned
that
the
flagship
of
that
squadron
the
had
a
library
and
a
school
on
board
so
i
made
this
kind
of
a
proposition
to
the
almighty
i
did
it
of
course
with
a
humble
spirit
and
a
devout
mind
but
i
did
it
in
a
very
clear
and
positive
manner
give
me
the
flagship
for
the
sake
of
the
schooling
i
will
get
there
and
i
will
give
you
my
life
i
prayed
daily
and
nightly
for
nearly
six
months
for
that
object
and
in
my
anxiety
over
the
matter
i
made
a
dicker
with
a
man
who
was
to
embark
at
the
same
time
that
if
he
should
be
lucky
enough
to
get
the
flagship
and
i
should
be
appointed
to
some
other
ship
i
would
give
him
a
money
consideration
and
request
the
commander
to
permit
us
to
exchange
this
was
a
break
in
my
faith
and
i
quickly
corrected
it
leaving
the
entire
matter
in
supernatural
hands
there
came
a
time
when
i
was
sure
in
my
mind
that
i
would
get
that
ship
a
time
when
there
was
no
longer
zest
in
praying
for
it
and
there
entered
into
my
praying
phrases
of
gratitude
instead
of
request
there
came
also
a
time
when
i
confided
this
assurance
to
my
closest
friend
to
whom
it
was
all
moonshine
he
laughed
and
poked
fun
at
the
idea
it
became
a
joke
and
i
was
hurt
and
chagrined
the
eventful
morning
arrived
those
for
embarkation
were
called
out
for
parade
in
full
marching
order
and
the
roll
was
called
the
universe
seemed
to
hang
in
the
balance
that
morning
finally
the
moment
arrived
my
name
was
called
i
took
one
pace
to
the
front
ported
my
arms
and
awaited
the
verdict
my
name
and
company
were
called
and
this
assignment
to
her
majesty
ship
my
comrades
giggled
and
were
sharply
rebuked
i
gave
vent
to
an
inarticulate
guttural
sound
and
was
also
rebuked
after
parade
i
went
to
my
changed
my
uniform
and
disappeared
to
escape
ridicule
what
cheer
condor
were
the
first
words
that
greeted
me
at
reveille
next
morning
and
my
kept
it
up
sometimes
the
ridicule
worked
overtime
often
i
was
on
the
edge
of
a
wild
outburst
of
passion
and
resentment
but
i
mastered
these
things
and
went
on
with
my
duties
at
eleven
in
the
forenoon
of
the
day
following
my
assignment
we
mustered
kits
this
is
the
ordinary
inspection
after
inspection
we
packed
our
kits
and
were
stood
to
attention
several
corrections
were
made
in
the
instructions
of
the
previous
day
my
heart
almost
stopped
beating
when
my
name
was
called
a
second
time
a
mistake
was
made
the
officer
got
no
farther
i
knew
it
begorra
i
exclaimed
with
flushed
face
and
beating
heart
the
officer
came
close
to
me
looked
straight
into
my
face
and
said
i
have
a
good
mind
to
put
you
in
the
guard
room
i
stood
still
motionless
silent
a
mistake
was
made
yesterday
he
continued
in
appointing
you
to
the
you
are
to
go
instead
with
a
detachment
to
the
flagship
of
the
mediterranean
squadron
parade
was
dismissed
i
went
to
the
officer
saluted
him
and
begged
the
privilege
of
an
explanation
in
a
few
words
i
told
him
my
story
and
of
the
hope
of
my
life
and
asked
him
to
forgive
me
for
the
interruption
he
looked
astonished
and
replied
very
quietly
i
am
glad
you
told
me
irvine
i
shall
be
interested
in
your
future
on
the
way
to
the
the
spirit
of
exuberant
merriment
took
possession
of
me
i
wanted
to
do
something
ludicrous
or
desperate
i
threw
my
pack
into
a
corner
quickly
divested
myself
of
my
tunic
rolled
up
my
shirt
sleeves
and
struck
the
table
such
a
blow
with
my
clinched
fist
as
to
make
the
dishes
jump
off
everybody
looked
around
my
face
must
have
been
a
picture
of
facial
latitude
illustration
alexander
irvine
as
a
marine
at
the
age
of
nineteen
boys
i
said
here
yer
last
chance
to
oblige
an
irishman
what
is
it
pat
half
a
dozen
shouted
in
unison
i
want
to
box
any
three
blinderin
idiots
in
the
room
and
all
together
begorra
come
on
now
ye
spalpeens
and
show
the
stuff
yer
made
of
the
only
answer
was
a
loud
outburst
of
applause
and
laughter
in
my
exuberance
i
danced
an
irish
hornpipe
and
my
career
in
the
was
over
chapter
iii
on
board
a
man
o
war
in
january
the
big
bearing
reinforcements
for
the
mediterranean
squadron
steamed
into
malta
harbour
and
we
were
transferred
to
our
respective
ships
the
was
supposed
to
be
the
most
powerful
ship
in
victoria
navy
at
that
time
she
carried
the
flag
of
admiral
lord
john
hay
she
was
a
little
city
of
the
sea
with
her
divisions
of
labour
her
social
distinctions
her
alleys
and
her
avenues
she
had
a
population
of
about
one
thousand
inhabitants
these
were
divided
into
officers
petty
officers
bluejackets
and
marines
around
the
flagship
lay
half
a
dozen
other
ships
of
the
fleet
i
was
fascinated
with
the
variety
of
things
around
me
in
that
little
city
and
for
the
first
few
days
on
board
spent
all
my
leisure
time
in
exploring
this
mysterious
underwater
world
her
guns
were
of
the
heaviest
calibre
her
steel
walls
were
decorated
with
ponderous
pallasier
shot
and
shell
i
was
struck
with
the
marvellous
cleanliness
her
decks
were
white
every
inch
of
brasswork
was
shining
everything
in
order
everything
trim
and
neat
neither
slovenly
men
nor
slovenly
conditions
malta
harbour
is
one
of
the
finest
in
the
world
the
old
city
of
la
vallette
looks
like
an
immense
fortress
which
it
really
is
and
the
next
thing
to
explore
was
the
island
it
seemed
as
if
i
had
entered
an
entirely
new
world
my
heart
was
full
of
joy
my
mind
full
of
hope
and
my
uniform
for
the
time
being
was
more
the
uniform
of
a
student
than
of
a
fighter
my
first
great
discovery
on
the
ship
was
the
thing
i
had
prayed
for
a
school
i
hid
myself
behind
a
stanchion
out
of
sight
of
the
instructors
and
took
my
bearings
later
i
found
a
place
where
i
could
sit
within
hearing
distance
but
was
discovered
and
forced
to
explain
the
chief
instructor
was
interested
in
my
explanation
and
in
my
story
and
gave
me
valuable
advice
as
to
how
to
proceed
in
my
studies
once
again
my
brogue
militated
against
my
advancement
being
the
only
irishman
in
the
mess
i
had
to
bear
more
than
my
share
of
its
humour
i
made
application
to
be
employed
as
a
waiter
in
the
officers
wardroom
so
that
i
might
improve
my
pronunciation
and
add
to
my
vocabulary
i
had
a
little
pad
arranged
on
the
inside
of
my
jacket
with
a
pencil
attached
and
every
new
word
i
heard
i
jotted
down
and
every
night
i
gathered
together
these
new
friends
looked
up
their
origin
meaning
and
pronunciation
i
was
appointed
bodyservant
to
the
paymaster
of
the
ship
a
bucolic
old
bourbon
of
the
most
pronounced
aristocracy
this
excused
me
from
military
and
naval
duty
and
i
was
privileged
to
wear
plain
clothes
i
attached
myself
to
a
small
group
of
pietists
called
plymouth
brethren
orthodox
theologians
literalists
in
interpretation
of
the
scriptures
and
exceedingly
in
their
morality
they
were
fine
bible
students
indeed
bible
experts
this
was
a
great
joy
to
me
at
first
but
the
atmosphere
to
a
jubilant
nature
like
mine
was
rather
stifling
after
a
while
i
was
fond
of
a
good
story
and
was
full
of
irish
folklore
and
fairy
stories
and
i
noticed
my
brethren
did
not
relish
my
outbursts
of
laughter
it
was
explosive
spontaneous
and
hearty
but
not
contagious
among
them
their
faces
assumed
a
rather
pained
expression
a
kind
of
notice
of
emotion
that
a
sense
of
humour
and
religious
beliefs
occupied
different
compartments
in
the
human
mind
it
was
intimated
to
me
that
such
frivolousness
was
out
of
kelter
with
the
profession
of
a
christian
it
was
merely
by
accident
that
i
pulled
out
of
a
shelf
in
the
library
adam
bede
by
george
eliot
when
i
was
discovered
eagerly
devouring
its
contents
under
the
glare
of
the
fighting
lamp
one
night
after
the
crew
had
piped
down
i
was
upbraided
for
spending
such
precious
time
on
such
worldly
trash
suppose
the
lord
should
come
now
and
find
you
reading
that
what
would
you
say
to
him
my
reply
added
to
their
sorrow
i
should
say
yer
honour
it
a
bully
good
story
the
judgment
of
my
brethren
was
that
there
was
good
stuff
in
me
for
a
christian
if
i
had
only
been
born
somewhere
else
a
judgment
i
could
not
be
expected
to
agree
with
my
disagreement
with
these
men
on
various
lines
was
no
barrier
to
my
participation
in
their
propaganda
there
was
only
one
thing
in
the
world
to
do
get
men
converted
each
man
in
this
small
group
picked
out
another
man
as
a
subject
of
prayer
and
solicitation
and
persuasion
at
our
weekly
meetings
we
reported
on
our
work
then
we
worked
for
each
other
of
course
i
was
a
subject
of
prayer
myself
when
these
men
shook
hands
in
parting
they
usually
said
if
the
lord
tarry
for
the
lord
was
expected
to
come
at
any
moment
this
they
could
not
get
into
my
speech
or
mind
as
i
looked
around
me
i
got
the
idea
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
work
to
be
done
before
the
lord
came
and
i
put
emphasis
rather
on
the
work
than
on
the
expectation
the
ship
was
a
beehive
of
activity
not
merely
the
activity
of
warlike
discipline
or
preparation
but
social
activity
of
course
this
activity
was
largely
for
the
officers
we
had
to
go
ashore
for
most
of
ours
and
the
social
activity
of
the
rank
and
file
was
rather
of
a
questionable
character
ashore
but
the
officers
had
their
dinners
their
dances
and
their
afternoon
receptions
the
social
centre
for
a
portion
of
the
rank
and
file
was
a
institute
as
this
was
a
temperance
institution
it
was
only
patronized
by
a
small
percentage
of
them
here
we
had
frequent
receptions
afternoon
teas
lectures
and
religious
meetings
here
the
secret
societies
met
the
free
masons
odd
fellows
foresters
orangemen
etc
thursday
afternoons
we
had
a
on
board
it
was
called
day
the
upper
decks
belonged
to
the
crew
that
afternoon
and
every
conceivable
kind
of
activity
was
in
operation
it
looked
something
like
an
irish
fair
it
was
a
day
on
which
most
men
wrote
home
but
there
were
sewing
boxing
fencing
and
on
this
afternoon
at
least
almost
every
man
on
the
ship
worked
at
his
hobby
my
hobby
at
this
time
was
mathematics
and
i
could
not
do
that
in
the
crowd
but
on
thursday
afternoons
i
rather
enjoyed
watching
the
boxing
and
fencing
my
experience
in
the
game
had
given
me
at
least
a
permanent
interest
in
it
and
as
i
stood
by
the
ropes
the
blood
tingled
in
my
veins
i
was
anxious
many
a
time
for
a
rough
and
tumble
but
my
religious
friends
saved
me
from
this
indulgence
there
were
sixteen
men
in
my
mess
it
was
in
a
corner
of
the
main
gun
battery
alongside
one
of
the
big
we
had
a
table
that
could
be
lowered
from
the
roof
of
the
gun
battery
and
eating
three
times
a
day
with
these
men
i
knew
them
fairly
well
and
they
knew
me
each
man
is
allowed
a
daily
portion
of
rum
and
i
was
advised
by
the
small
group
of
christians
to
follow
their
example
and
refuse
to
permit
anybody
else
to
drink
my
portion
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
make
up
my
mind
to
follow
their
advice
it
was
of
course
considered
an
thing
to
do
but
i
finally
came
to
the
point
when
i
asked
the
commissariat
department
to
give
me
as
was
the
custom
tea
coffee
and
sugar
instead
i
took
very
good
care
however
not
to
indulge
myself
in
these
things
i
handed
them
over
to
men
on
the
night
watches
this
did
not
save
me
from
the
penalty
for
such
an
offence
it
brought
down
on
my
head
the
curses
of
a
good
many
men
in
the
mess
but
especially
of
one
man
who
was
a
sort
of
a
ship
bruiser
it
came
his
turn
to
be
cook
about
once
in
ten
days
the
cook
of
the
mess
had
as
his
perquisite
a
little
of
each
man
ration
of
rum
with
the
others
the
abuse
was
mixed
with
for
on
the
whole
i
managed
to
lead
a
fairly
agreeable
life
with
my
messmates
they
looked
upon
me
as
a
religious
fanatic
but
my
laughter
my
funny
stories
and
my
willingness
to
oblige
offset
with
most
of
them
my
temperance
principles
and
religious
fanaticism
the
insults
of
the
bruiser
i
usually
met
with
a
smile
and
passed
off
with
a
joke
but
when
they
were
long
continued
they
irritated
me
there
is
a
monotony
in
the
life
of
the
average
soldier
or
sailor
which
has
a
very
deadening
effect
upon
character
seeing
the
same
faces
hearing
the
same
things
performing
the
same
routine
in
the
same
kind
of
way
every
day
year
in
and
year
out
makes
him
a
sort
of
automaton
kipling
has
told
us
something
of
the
effect
of
this
thing
in
soldiers
three
there
came
a
time
when
i
broke
under
the
strain
of
this
continued
insults
for
nearly
a
year
i
got
comfort
from
the
advice
of
the
brethren
we
had
a
weekly
meeting
where
our
difficulties
were
considered
and
prayed
over
but
the
consolation
of
my
brethren
finally
refused
to
suffice
and
being
a
healthy
normal
vigorous
animal
with
some
little
experience
of
looking
after
myself
i
began
to
resent
the
insults
and
make
some
show
of
defence
this
change
of
front
incensed
the
bully
and
one
day
he
hurled
an
exceedingly
nasty
epithet
at
me
one
of
those
vulgar
but
usual
epithets
current
in
army
speech
the
reference
in
it
to
my
mother
stirred
me
with
indignation
and
i
announced
in
a
fit
of
anger
my
willingness
to
be
thrashed
or
thrash
him
if
the
thing
was
repeated
it
was
not
only
repeated
at
once
but
seizing
a
lump
of
dough
he
hurled
it
at
my
head
i
ducked
my
head
and
it
hit
another
man
on
the
jaw
but
the
gauntlet
was
on
the
floor
and
an
hour
afterward
the
port
side
of
the
gun
deck
was
a
mass
of
solidly
packed
sailors
and
marines
my
brethren
came
to
me
one
after
another
they
quoted
scores
of
texts
to
make
me
uncomfortable
i
tried
to
joke
but
my
lips
were
parched
and
my
tongue
unwilling
to
act
i
was
pale
and
trembling
i
knew
what
i
was
up
against
but
determined
to
see
it
through
one
text
only
i
could
remember
in
this
exigency
and
i
quoted
it
to
lanky
lawrence
the
big
sailmaker
who
was
the
leader
of
our
sect
lanky
m
boy
i
said
to
him
i
goin
to
hing
m
hat
on
one
text
fur
the
space
of
a
good
thrashin
what
is
it
asked
the
sailmaker
much
as
lieth
in
ye
live
peaceably
wid
all
men
now
i
have
done
that
same
and
bedad
i
have
done
it
to
the
limit
and
i
goin
to
jump
into
this
physical
continshun
so
that
of
out
it
i
will
bring
pace
ye
all
wrong
said
the
sailmaker
i
know
it
but
from
the
of
your
theology
i
want
a
vacation
lanky
just
for
the
space
that
it
takes
to
get
a
lickin
wan
way
or
th
other
so
the
thing
began
my
chief
endeavour
was
to
escape
punishment
but
the
space
was
exceedingly
small
between
the
two
big
guns
and
i
did
succeed
very
well
during
the
first
five
minutes
i
was
very
badly
bruised
and
beaten
one
of
my
ribs
was
broken
and
both
eyes
almost
closed
half
the
time
i
could
not
see
the
bully
at
all
in
one
of
the
breathing
spells
the
sailmaker
who
despite
his
quotations
of
scripture
had
remained
to
see
the
proceedings
whispered
something
in
my
ear
it
was
a
point
of
advice
he
told
me
that
if
i
could
stand
that
five
minutes
longer
my
opponent
would
be
outclassed
the
support
of
lanky
was
a
great
encouragement
to
me
and
a
good
deal
of
my
fear
disappeared
i
began
to
think
harder
to
plan
and
to
plant
blows
as
well
as
to
avoid
them
this
excited
the
crowd
and
it
became
frenzied
up
to
that
point
it
was
a
thing
now
i
was
not
only
taking
but
giving
and
not
only
giving
but
giving
with
laughter
and
ejaculations
our
bible
study
for
that
month
was
the
memorizing
of
the
names
of
the
minor
prophets
and
once
when
i
managed
to
toss
my
opponent
head
to
one
side
with
a
blow
on
the
point
of
the
chin
i
shouted
full
of
glee
take
that
you
son
of
a
seacook
take
it
in
the
name
of
hosea
the
crowd
laughed
but
above
the
roar
of
laughter
rang
out
the
voice
of
a
scotchman
who
was
one
of
our
best
bible
students
gie
him
brimstone
sandy
a
few
minutes
later
i
ejaculated
and
bedad
that
for
joel
in
this
new
spirit
and
in
this
jocular
way
i
pounded
the
twelve
minor
prophets
into
him
one
after
another
while
the
rafters
of
the
ship
rang
with
the
cheers
of
the
crew
by
the
time
i
had
exhausted
the
minor
prophets
i
was
much
the
stronger
man
of
the
two
my
opponent
was
wobbling
around
in
pretty
bad
shape
once
he
was
on
his
knees
and
while
waiting
i
shouted
i
want
to
be
yer
friend
billy
creedan
shake
hands
now
you
idiot
and
behave
yourself
the
only
answer
i
got
was
a
string
of
vile
oaths
as
he
staggered
to
his
feet
i
pleaded
with
him
to
quit
but
that
is
not
the
way
that
such
fights
end
men
fight
while
their
senses
last
while
their
legs
keep
under
them
and
at
such
a
moment
a
crowd
becomes
crazed
for
the
accomplishment
of
something
that
looks
like
murder
the
injection
of
the
minor
prophets
made
a
ludicrous
ending
of
a
thing
that
had
at
the
beginning
almost
paralyzed
me
with
fear
so
the
thing
ended
with
the
bully
of
the
mess
lying
prostrate
on
his
back
i
was
not
presentable
as
a
waiter
for
several
days
but
inside
of
an
hour
everybody
on
the
ship
knew
what
had
happened
and
for
the
second
time
in
my
life
i
was
hailed
as
a
bruiser
to
impress
a
thousand
men
in
such
a
manner
creates
an
egotism
which
is
very
likely
to
be
lasting
i
had
not
accomplished
very
much
in
my
studies
i
was
nothing
in
particular
among
my
religious
brethren
my
general
reputation
up
to
this
moment
in
the
ship
was
that
of
a
irish
lad
who
was
a
religious
fanatic
a
sort
of
sky
pilot
or
holy
joe
i
became
flushed
with
the
only
victory
worth
while
in
the
army
or
navy
and
the
second
experience
lasted
twice
as
long
as
the
first
the
next
thing
to
be
done
of
course
by
my
friends
and
admirers
was
to
pit
me
against
the
bruisers
of
other
ships
two
of
the
officers
wanted
to
know
my
plans
this
recognition
heightened
my
vanity
night
came
along
and
i
was
ashamed
to
attend
a
committee
was
sent
to
help
me
out
and
the
following
week
the
prodigal
returned
the
proper
thing
to
do
on
my
return
was
to
confess
my
sin
and
ask
the
brethren
to
pray
for
me
but
when
i
failed
to
do
this
i
became
a
subject
of
deep
concern
and
solicitude
i
tried
to
cultivate
a
sense
of
conviction
but
succeeded
indifferently
the
deference
paid
me
by
the
men
of
the
mess
was
not
calculated
to
help
me
out
i
felt
very
keenly
the
suspicion
of
my
brethren
but
it
was
compensated
for
by
the
fact
that
among
the
ordinary
men
i
had
now
a
hearing
on
matters
of
religious
interest
i
was
rather
diffident
in
approaching
them
on
this
subject
since
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
pietists
i
had
fallen
from
grace
at
the
end
of
a
month
a
loathing
of
this
cheap
reputation
began
to
manifest
itself
the
man
i
had
beaten
became
one
of
my
closest
friends
i
wrote
his
letters
home
to
his
mother
a
few
weeks
later
he
entrusted
me
with
a
more
sacred
mission
the
writing
of
his
love
letters
also
creedan
was
a
lancashire
man
as
angular
in
speech
as
in
body
and
lacking
utterly
a
sense
of
humour
as
we
became
acquainted
i
began
to
suggest
some
improvements
not
only
in
his
manner
of
writing
but
in
the
matter
also
i
could
not
understand
how
a
man
could
make
love
with
that
kind
of
nature
one
day
i
suggested
the
idea
of
rewriting
the
entire
epistle
the
effect
of
it
was
a
huge
joke
to
creedan
he
laughed
at
the
change
laughed
loud
and
heartily
the
letter
of
course
was
plastered
all
over
with
irish
blarney
it
was
such
a
huge
success
that
creedan
used
to
come
to
me
and
say
illustration
officers
of
ashore
at
cattaro
hey
sandy
shoot
off
one
of
them
things
to
mary
will
ye
and
the
thing
was
done
the
summer
cruise
of
was
up
the
adriatic
all
the
greek
islands
were
visited
i
knew
the
historical
significance
of
the
places
which
made
that
summer
cruise
a
fairyland
to
me
there
were
incidents
in
that
summer
cruise
of
more
than
ordinary
interest
one
morning
while
our
ship
was
anchored
in
the
harbour
of
chios
the
rock
on
which
our
anchor
lay
was
moved
by
a
sudden
convulsion
the
mighty
cable
was
snapped
and
the
ship
tossed
like
a
cork
by
the
strain
the
guns
were
torn
from
their
gearing
and
the
shot
and
shell
torn
from
their
racks
men
on
their
feet
were
flung
prostrate
and
everything
loose
scattered
over
the
decks
the
shrill
blast
of
the
bugle
sounded
the
still
such
a
sound
is
very
seldom
blown
from
the
bugles
but
when
it
is
every
man
stops
absolutely
still
and
awaits
orders
the
boatswain
blew
his
whistle
which
was
followed
with
the
captain
order
port
watch
on
deck
every
other
man
to
his
post
five
minutes
later
on
the
port
side
of
the
ship
i
saw
the
british
consul
house
roll
down
the
side
of
the
hill
i
saw
the
people
flock
around
a
priest
who
swung
his
censer
and
called
upon
god
the
yawning
gulf
was
there
into
which
a
part
of
the
little
town
had
sunk
a
detachment
of
marines
and
bluejackets
went
ashore
not
knowing
the
moment
when
the
earth
would
open
up
and
swallow
them
the
boats
were
lowered
and
orders
were
given
to
stand
ready
to
pack
the
ship
to
the
last
item
of
capacity
and
carry
away
the
refugees
from
what
we
supposed
to
be
a
sinking
island
of
course
in
a
crisis
like
this
the
sentiment
of
religion
becomes
dominant
some
of
my
comrades
at
once
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
the
coming
of
the
lord
and
in
the
solemnity
of
the
moment
i
could
not
resist
the
suggestion
for
which
i
was
derided
for
months
gee
but
is
he
coming
with
a
bang
chapter
iv
problems
and
places
in
i
kept
a
diary
kept
it
the
entire
year
it
was
written
in
the
straggling
characters
of
a
child
of
ten
as
i
peruse
it
now
years
afterward
i
am
struck
not
so
much
with
what
it
records
as
with
what
it
leaves
unrecorded
the
great
places
visited
and
the
names
of
great
men
are
chronicled
bible
studies
and
religious
observations
find
a
place
but
of
the
fierce
struggle
of
the
human
soul
with
destructive
and
corrupting
influences
not
a
word
the
itinerary
of
the
year
included
egypt
turkey
greece
italy
syria
asia
minor
cyprus
crete
and
sicily
of
these
syria
was
of
the
greatest
interest
to
me
of
the
men
whose
pathway
crossed
mine
general
gordon
was
of
the
most
importance
of
the
others
the
king
of
greece
and
the
second
son
of
victoria
were
unique
but
not
interesting
one
in
my
position
could
only
meet
them
as
a
flunky
meets
his
master
anyway
gordon
on
his
way
to
his
doom
in
the
soudan
disembarked
at
alexandria
it
was
early
in
january
there
was
no
parade
no
reception
of
any
kind
gordon
was
dressed
in
plain
clothes
with
a
cane
in
his
hand
gladstone
had
sent
him
thus
to
bring
order
out
of
chaos
in
the
land
of
the
mad
mullah
officers
with
a
penchant
for
religious
propaganda
are
scarce
either
in
the
army
or
navy
but
into
whatever
part
of
the
world
gordon
went
he
was
known
and
recognized
and
sought
after
by
men
engaged
in
religious
work
it
was
an
officer
of
the
royal
naval
temperance
society
who
was
at
the
same
time
a
naval
petty
officer
who
said
to
me
on
the
wharf
at
alexandria
that
chinese
gordon
where
is
he
going
i
asked
down
the
nile
to
civilize
niggers
who
are
dressed
in
palm
oil
and
mosquitoes
was
the
answer
a
year
later
gladstone
sent
an
army
and
spent
millions
of
money
to
bring
him
back
but
it
was
too
late
while
lying
off
piræus
the
seaport
of
athens
i
was
doing
guard
duty
on
deck
in
the
first
watch
i
was
substitute
for
a
comrade
who
had
gone
to
visit
the
ancient
city
there
had
been
an
informal
dinner
and
there
were
whispers
among
the
men
that
some
high
mogul
was
in
the
admiral
cabin
toward
the
close
of
the
first
watch
i
was
joined
on
my
beat
by
a
man
in
plain
clothes
who
with
a
lighted
cigar
in
his
mouth
marched
fore
and
aft
the
side
of
the
ship
with
me
in
anticipation
of
entering
greek
waters
i
had
read
for
months
and
this
stranger
was
astonished
to
find
a
common
soldier
so
well
informed
on
the
history
of
greece
i
had
not
yet
been
ashore
but
i
had
arranged
to
go
the
following
day
the
gentleman
on
leaving
handed
me
a
card
on
which
he
had
pencilled
what
i
think
was
an
introduction
i
had
only
time
to
ask
him
his
name
and
he
said
george
just
george
next
day
i
discovered
i
had
been
with
a
king
the
effect
on
me
was
almost
as
bad
as
a
successful
go
with
the
gloves
the
channel
squadron
flying
the
flag
of
the
duke
of
edinburgh
entered
malta
harbour
that
year
and
for
some
weeks
the
combined
fleets
lay
moored
alongside
each
other
the
royal
admiral
was
a
frequent
visitor
to
our
ship
on
one
of
these
visits
i
had
the
experience
of
serving
him
with
luncheon
he
was
the
guest
of
our
skipper
during
the
luncheon
i
handed
him
a
note
from
his
flag
lieutenant
a
dealer
in
mummies
had
come
aboard
with
some
samples
they
were
spread
out
on
the
the
note
related
the
facts
but
the
queen
son
was
not
impressed
and
said
so
illustration
a
page
from
irvine
diary
kept
while
serving
on
tell
him
said
he
to
go
to
oh
wait
a
moment
then
he
pencilled
his
reply
on
the
back
of
a
note
and
handed
it
to
me
when
the
flag
lieutenant
read
it
he
laughed
tore
it
up
and
handed
the
pieces
to
me
the
duke
reply
read
he
may
go
to
the
d
with
the
whole
boiling
a
right
off
the
coast
of
sicily
we
encountered
a
bit
of
rough
water
and
commander
campbell
a
seaman
of
the
old
school
took
advantage
of
it
for
sail
drill
strike
lower
yards
and
top
masts
was
the
order
and
clear
the
decks
for
action
away
aloft
he
roared
as
the
wind
soughed
through
the
rigging
and
a
moment
later
i
heard
bear
out
on
the
something
went
wrong
in
the
foretop
that
day
and
its
captain
fell
to
the
hatchway
grating
below
i
was
standing
a
few
feet
from
the
spot
and
it
took
me
the
best
part
of
the
day
to
sponge
his
blood
out
of
my
clothing
we
stopped
the
evolution
for
a
day
and
the
following
day
another
man
was
killed
performing
the
same
drill
and
we
buried
them
both
that
afternoon
in
the
old
cemetery
at
the
base
of
mt
etna
at
noon
on
the
third
day
the
ship
was
ordered
to
go
through
the
same
evolution
meantime
a
petty
officer
named
hicks
had
been
promoted
captain
of
the
foretop
he
was
one
of
the
finest
men
in
the
ship
he
could
dance
a
hornpipe
sing
a
good
song
make
a
splendid
showing
with
the
gloves
or
was
something
of
a
wag
and
when
he
laughed
the
deck
trembled
his
promotion
was
not
wholly
a
thing
of
joy
for
the
superstition
of
the
sea
gripped
him
tight
he
was
the
third
man
and
to
most
of
us
the
number
had
an
evil
omen
within
an
hour
after
his
promotion
the
red
flush
had
gone
from
his
cheeks
he
was
silent
and
managed
to
be
alone
most
of
the
afternoon
and
evening
of
that
day
he
had
been
a
signal
boy
and
was
an
expert
in
the
language
of
flags
and
in
flashing
the
electric
light
he
was
unable
to
sleep
and
passed
most
of
the
night
on
deck
with
the
sentries
it
was
noticed
that
he
begged
permission
to
monkey
with
the
signalling
apparatus
aft
on
the
poop
when
we
began
the
sail
drill
the
following
day
the
attention
of
every
man
on
the
ship
was
focused
on
the
captain
of
the
foretop
and
at
the
order
away
aloft
he
sprang
at
the
rigging
like
a
cat
we
stood
from
under
there
was
a
breathless
hush
as
the
second
order
was
given
bear
out
on
the
it
was
the
fatal
order
at
which
the
other
men
had
lost
their
nerve
and
their
lives
as
it
rang
out
over
the
old
ship
we
gulped
down
our
lumps
and
secretly
thanked
him
in
the
hollow
of
whose
hand
lie
the
seas
the
evolution
was
completed
and
when
the
man
of
the
foretop
descended
to
the
deck
half
a
dozen
men
gripped
hicks
and
hugged
him
and
kissed
him
with
tears
in
their
eyes
something
really
did
happen
in
the
foretop
that
day
something
happened
to
its
captain
though
nobody
knew
just
what
it
was
he
came
to
the
deck
a
changed
man
and
those
who
knew
him
best
felt
it
most
we
could
not
analyze
it
he
could
not
himself
i
got
into
the
secret
by
accident
some
weeks
later
it
may
have
been
months
an
officer
from
another
ship
was
lunching
with
a
friend
in
our
wardroom
i
served
the
lunch
and
overheard
the
following
conversation
have
you
a
signal
man
by
the
name
of
hicks
billy
hicks
on
board
yes
what
about
him
well
the
officer
said
smiling
we
were
ten
miles
out
at
sea
a
few
weeks
ago
when
i
noticed
the
signals
flashing
all
over
the
heavens
i
was
officer
of
the
deck
it
was
about
seven
bells
in
the
first
watch
i
called
my
signal
officer
told
him
to
take
down
what
he
read
he
pulled
out
his
notebook
still
smiling
and
spelling
out
the
words
read
this
is
billy
hicks
i
ai
afraid
of
no
bloomin
man
nor
devil
i
ai
afraid
of
no
davey
jones
bleedin
locker
neither
i
ai
like
a
bawlin
baby
afussin
at
his
dad
for
sweeties
i
doant
ask
you
for
no
favours
but
just
one
this
is
it
when
i
strike
the
foretop
let
me
do
it
with
the
guts
of
a
man
what
is
clean
and
god
dear
god
from
this
here
day
on
giv
me
the
feeling
i
use
to
have
long
ago
when
i
nelt
at
my
mother
knee
an
said
our
father
good
night
dear
i
went
out
into
the
pantry
of
the
wardroom
jotted
down
as
much
of
this
as
i
could
remember
and
it
gave
me
a
splendid
introduction
to
the
captain
of
the
foretop
the
greatest
problem
of
my
life
and
perhaps
of
any
life
at
the
age
of
was
the
problem
of
sex
instinct
i
have
often
wondered
why
that
problem
is
discussed
so
meagrely
i
have
often
wondered
why
for
instance
kipling
and
frank
bullen
and
clark
russell
in
discussing
the
life
of
soldiers
and
sailors
with
whom
this
is
a
specialized
problem
have
not
frankly
discussed
the
terrific
battle
that
every
man
must
fight
on
this
question
the
moment
i
arrived
in
that
foreign
port
i
was
overwhelmed
with
a
sense
of
personal
freedom
there
i
was
with
a
splendid
physical
organization
that
had
just
come
into
its
own
and
around
me
in
the
mess
and
on
the
ship
deck
and
on
the
streets
of
the
cities
everywhere
i
heard
nothing
else
but
conversation
on
this
problem
to
nine
out
of
every
ten
men
it
was
a
joke
it
was
laughed
at
played
with
and
i
knew
of
course
that
young
men
of
my
own
age
were
being
smashed
on
the
rocks
of
this
problem
the
british
navy
serves
out
once
or
twice
a
week
a
ration
which
is
one
of
the
biggest
jokes
of
naval
life
it
is
a
small
ration
of
lime
juice
and
the
rumoured
purpose
of
it
is
to
modify
in
some
degree
this
tremendous
natural
sex
instinct
to
most
of
us
it
was
like
spitting
on
a
burning
building
the
battle
went
on
fiercer
every
day
of
life
i
tackled
it
from
two
points
of
view
first
the
moral
point
of
view
my
religion
demanded
purity
continence
and
the
other
point
of
view
i
do
think
this
was
clear
to
me
at
the
time
i
believe
that
i
intentionally
pursued
this
course
with
the
object
in
view
that
it
actually
accomplished
nevertheless
whether
intentional
or
unintentional
planned
or
unplanned
the
effect
was
produced
the
physical
work
required
of
me
was
light
very
light
and
all
my
leisure
time
was
spent
in
study
i
studied
so
hard
and
so
conscientiously
that
i
tired
not
only
my
mind
but
my
body
there
came
a
time
when
i
was
dimly
conscious
however
that
i
was
doing
two
things
by
hard
study
i
was
preserving
my
body
conserving
my
vital
energy
and
at
the
same
time
training
my
mind
gathering
information
and
equipping
myself
intellectually
at
the
present
moment
my
body
is
as
lithe
as
powerful
and
as
enduring
as
the
body
of
a
youth
of
twenty
and
i
attribute
this
wealth
of
health
to
the
fact
that
years
ago
i
tackled
this
problem
of
and
laid
the
foundations
for
my
present
strength
who
will
give
the
world
a
novel
or
a
book
dealing
with
this
terrific
problem
who
will
tell
millions
of
young
men
around
the
age
of
twenty
that
they
can
not
burn
their
candle
at
both
ends
with
the
ordinary
man
in
civil
life
the
temptation
is
a
negligible
quantity
compared
to
the
life
of
a
soldier
or
sailor
in
the
army
and
navy
it
is
talked
incessantly
so
that
a
man
has
a
double
battle
to
fight
he
fights
the
thing
and
he
fights
a
multitude
of
suggestions
that
come
to
him
every
day
of
his
life
the
most
revolting
disgusting
and
degrading
thing
i
ever
heard
talked
about
on
a
man
o
war
was
the
perversion
of
the
sex
instinct
the
unnatural
use
of
it
this
too
is
a
joke
and
laughed
at
and
talked
lightly
about
but
the
records
of
the
british
navy
and
i
think
of
other
navies
would
reveal
something
along
this
line
that
would
shock
civilization
i
did
not
believe
this
possible
but
the
first
six
months
on
board
changed
my
mind
to
the
great
credit
of
the
british
navy
be
it
said
that
this
crime
is
held
almost
equal
to
murder
and
when
an
officer
is
convicted
of
it
the
trial
is
and
the
findings
kept
secret
but
no
matter
how
high
his
rank
he
is
stripped
of
his
standing
and
marched
over
the
side
of
the
ship
as
a
degraded
criminal
and
an
outcast
a
man
of
the
ranks
convicted
of
it
usually
spends
the
rest
of
his
natural
life
in
prison
the
two
things
responsible
for
such
perversion
in
the
navy
are
first
the
herding
of
the
male
sex
together
and
for
long
periods
second
the
mode
of
dress
in
which
little
boys
begin
their
sea
life
these
are
the
problems
before
which
all
others
sink
into
utter
insignificance
the
army
and
navy
of
great
britain
is
recruited
very
largely
from
the
slums
of
great
cities
the
most
ignorant
the
most
brutal
and
most
immoral
of
mankind
are
drafted
by
the
incentive
of
a
better
life
than
they
have
ever
known
but
they
are
only
changed
outwardly
their
nature
their
habits
of
life
their
mental
does
not
change
or
if
it
changes
to
the
automatic
action
by
which
they
become
part
of
a
war
machine
they
lose
that
individual
freedom
that
is
the
boast
of
the
race
on
the
other
hand
i
must
say
that
in
all
my
contact
with
life
i
have
never
met
nor
been
associated
with
a
group
of
men
more
gentlemanly
better
educated
or
whose
total
sum
of
right
thinking
and
right
living
was
higher
than
that
group
of
officers
on
that
ship
i
certainly
attribute
a
great
deal
of
my
quickening
of
mind
to
contact
with
them
chapter
v
the
gordon
relief
expedition
the
incarceration
of
gordon
in
khartoum
was
a
matter
of
deep
concern
to
every
soldier
and
sailor
in
the
british
empire
particularly
to
those
of
us
who
were
in
and
around
egypt
at
the
time
it
has
not
always
been
plain
to
the
british
soldier
in
egypt
why
he
was
there
but
he
seldom
asks
why
he
is
anywhere
in
the
matter
of
gordon
however
the
case
was
different
they
all
knew
that
gladstone
had
sent
him
and
refused
to
relieve
him
at
least
the
relief
was
so
so
dilatory
that
it
was
practically
useless
i
had
made
application
for
my
discharge
from
the
service
by
purchase
a
matter
of
one
hundred
dollars
and
had
my
plans
made
out
for
further
study
but
the
plight
of
gordon
gripped
me
as
it
gripped
others
and
i
determined
to
throw
every
other
consideration
aside
and
get
to
the
front
there
was
one
chance
in
a
thousand
and
i
took
it
a
marine
officer
of
the
ship
was
called
for
and
his
valet
was
a
man
who
had
almost
served
his
time
had
seen
much
service
and
was
not
at
all
anxious
for
any
more
i
went
after
him
in
hand
i
will
give
you
all
i
possess
if
you
will
let
me
go
in
your
place
it
a
go
said
this
man
as
a
gleam
of
joy
overspread
his
face
the
officer
himself
was
glad
and
the
whole
thing
was
arranged
and
in
hours
i
was
on
board
the
peninsula
and
oriental
steamship
bound
for
the
red
sea
the
officer
was
the
most
brutal
cad
i
have
ever
met
he
strutted
like
a
peacock
and
seemed
to
take
delight
in
humiliating
when
an
opportunity
would
present
itself
anybody
and
everybody
beneath
him
in
rank
he
was
a
captain
the
trip
through
the
suez
canal
might
be
considered
a
new
stage
of
development
for
i
travelled
as
a
passenger
to
be
consulted
as
to
what
i
should
eat
or
to
have
any
choice
whatever
was
not
only
new
but
startling
in
turning
a
curve
in
the
canal
we
encountered
a
sunken
ship
which
stopped
the
traffic
we
were
there
four
or
five
days
and
the
life
of
ease
and
luxury
with
opportunity
for
reading
and
social
intercourse
with
people
was
so
enjoyable
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
that
gordon
was
in
danger
in
khartoum
and
i
wanted
to
have
a
hand
in
his
relief
i
should
have
enjoyed
staying
there
a
month
we
disembarked
at
suakim
on
the
red
sea
and
we
were
the
officer
and
myself
immediately
attached
to
the
staff
of
general
sir
gerald
graham
in
the
desert
the
seven
months
in
the
desert
were
months
of
waiting
monotonous
deadening
waiting
the
greatest
difficulty
of
that
period
of
waiting
was
the
water
supply
we
were
served
out
with
a
pint
of
water
a
day
water
for
washing
was
out
of
the
question
our
laundry
method
was
a
kind
of
optical
illusion
we
took
our
flannel
shirts
rolled
them
up
as
tightly
as
possible
tied
them
with
strings
and
then
thumped
them
laboriously
with
the
butt
end
of
a
rifle
then
they
were
untied
shaken
out
brushed
and
they
were
ready
for
use
most
of
this
was
a
laundry
but
the
brushing
was
real
being
attached
to
the
general
staff
i
had
a
little
more
leeway
in
the
comforts
of
life
but
it
was
mighty
little
off
in
the
hills
ten
miles
distant
was
encamped
the
black
horde
under
osman
digna
and
every
night
of
the
seven
months
the
arabs
kept
up
firing
upon
us
sometimes
they
were
bold
enough
to
make
an
approach
in
a
body
in
the
darkness
but
we
had
powerful
electric
lights
that
could
search
the
desert
for
miles
we
got
accustomed
to
this
after
a
while
and
would
simply
lie
prostrate
while
the
light
was
turned
on
them
of
course
the
searching
of
the
desert
with
the
electric
lights
was
always
accompanied
with
the
levelling
of
our
artillery
on
whatever
the
light
revealed
not
very
much
destruction
was
accomplished
on
either
side
however
occasionally
a
stray
bullet
would
carry
off
one
of
our
men
in
his
sleep
sometimes
these
naked
savages
would
stealthily
creep
in
upon
our
sentries
and
with
their
sharp
knives
would
overpower
them
and
mutilate
them
in
an
indescribable
manner
to
prevent
this
we
laid
dynamite
mines
in
front
of
our
encampments
i
watched
late
one
afternoon
the
young
engineer
officer
as
he
connected
the
wires
for
the
night
perhaps
his
hand
trembled
as
he
made
connections
or
perhaps
some
mistake
was
made
anyway
there
was
an
explosion
great
masses
of
desert
sand
shot
into
the
air
like
a
cloud
and
when
it
fell
again
the
mangled
body
of
the
engineer
fell
with
it
but
the
mines
were
laid
connections
made
for
the
night
just
the
same
by
another
engineer
at
other
places
we
had
broken
bottles
fixed
in
the
sand
for
the
black
men
came
barefooted
and
they
were
more
seared
by
broken
bottles
in
the
sand
than
they
were
by
the
musketry
fire
a
night
of
great
excitement
was
that
of
the
capturing
of
some
of
our
mounted
scouts
in
a
sortie
near
the
hills
that
night
we
saw
half
a
dozen
immense
on
the
hilltops
and
the
impression
we
got
was
that
our
comrades
were
being
burned
alive
there
were
half
a
dozen
brushes
or
skirmishes
with
the
natives
during
my
stay
in
the
desert
but
i
did
not
experience
what
might
be
called
a
decisive
battle
there
had
been
decisive
battles
of
one
sort
or
another
but
i
was
not
present
they
were
before
my
time
they
began
the
laying
of
a
railway
from
suakim
to
berber
but
afterward
they
pulled
the
rails
up
the
soldiers
cursed
gladstone
for
the
laxity
of
his
foreign
policy
gordon
we
knew
was
in
khartoum
and
hard
pressed
and
outside
were
the
mahdi
and
his
multitude
and
why
the
government
should
hold
us
back
we
could
not
understand
the
desert
life
was
so
deadening
that
any
kind
of
a
change
would
have
been
welcome
every
man
would
have
been
glad
of
even
a
repetition
of
the
charge
at
balaklava
though
only
few
men
would
come
out
anything
was
preferable
to
rotting
in
the
desert
the
sun
was
striking
dead
one
out
of
every
two
men
i
thought
my
time
had
come
when
i
had
a
sunstroke
being
the
only
man
on
the
staff
stricken
i
was
well
looked
after
the
general
had
ice
and
i
was
privileged
to
have
the
luxury
of
it
i
was
also
given
a
glass
of
the
finest
french
brandy
i
asked
the
attendant
to
put
it
by
my
side
and
when
he
disappeared
out
of
my
tent
my
tent
was
so
small
that
it
barely
covered
my
body
i
went
through
a
fierce
battle
with
my
prejudices
i
was
a
fanatic
on
the
drink
question
i
had
sworn
eternal
hostility
to
it
and
with
good
reason
the
use
of
it
was
partly
responsible
for
my
lack
of
early
schooling
it
had
robbed
me
of
a
great
deal
of
the
life
of
my
old
mother
and
i
had
determined
to
put
up
a
tremendous
fight
against
it
here
the
thing
was
in
my
hands
ordered
by
the
doctor
but
i
tipped
it
into
the
sand
and
made
them
believe
that
i
had
drunk
it
i
had
seen
so
many
stricken
men
with
sunstroke
die
during
the
same
day
that
i
had
little
hope
of
my
own
recovery
but
inside
of
twelve
hours
i
was
on
my
feet
again
and
though
weak
at
work
it
was
recorded
that
we
lost
fifty
per
cent
of
our
strength
by
sunstroke
and
enteric
fever
it
was
very
noticeable
that
the
men
of
intemperate
habits
were
the
first
to
go
they
dropped
like
sheep
in
the
heat
of
the
day
and
by
sundown
they
lay
beneath
a
winding
sheet
of
desert
sand
the
actual
conflict
of
civilized
with
savage
forces
was
responsible
for
the
loss
of
very
few
men
the
sun
was
our
arch
enemy
to
break
the
monotony
we
tried
whatever
sport
was
possible
in
the
sand
the
national
game
cricket
came
in
for
a
trial
but
was
more
than
recreative
a
bundle
of
rags
tightly
rolled
up
in
a
sphere
served
as
a
ball
and
pieces
of
boards
of
old
served
as
bats
and
wickets
leapfrog
and
the
game
of
cat
were
favourite
pastimes
but
nothing
broke
the
monotony
it
was
depressing
and
it
was
not
an
unusual
sight
to
see
men
weeping
from
homesickness
utterly
unable
to
keep
back
the
tears
there
were
attempts
at
suicide
also
and
men
eagerly
sought
opportunity
to
endanger
themselves
actual
fighting
on
the
desert
was
to
us
the
greatest
possible
godsend
for
it
meant
either
death
or
relief
from
the
game
of
waiting
despite
the
fact
that
the
love
of
gordon
had
brought
me
there
i
was
not
enamoured
of
the
way
in
which
the
campaign
was
carried
on
of
course
when
in
actual
conflict
i
wanted
this
black
horde
wiped
off
the
face
of
the
earth
but
when
i
saw
boys
and
girls
ranging
from
six
to
ten
years
of
age
approaching
the
phalanx
of
british
bayonets
with
their
little
assagais
ready
to
do
battle
i
was
thrilled
with
admiration
for
them
some
of
our
officers
described
this
as
fanaticism
and
i
remember
a
discussion
that
took
place
between
two
of
them
as
to
whether
it
was
fanaticism
or
courage
and
a
unique
experiment
was
tried
we
had
with
us
always
a
contingent
of
friendly
natives
and
in
order
to
test
the
question
one
of
them
was
to
bare
his
back
for
a
shilling
and
an
officer
applied
to
it
with
all
his
strength
a
horsewhip
i
saw
the
black
man
body
writhe
for
an
instant
as
he
puckered
his
mouth
but
it
was
only
for
an
instant
then
he
smiled
and
asked
for
another
stroke
for
another
shilling
this
seemed
to
indicate
to
the
officers
that
there
was
something
more
than
fanaticism
in
the
soudanese
their
warriors
were
tall
powerfully
built
men
we
used
to
say
they
were
dressed
in
palm
oil
and
mosquitoes
their
hair
stood
straight
up
and
their
bodies
were
greased
i
think
it
was
the
general
opinion
of
our
officers
that
if
these
men
could
be
disciplined
and
drilled
as
european
soldiers
are
they
would
make
the
finest
fighters
in
the
world
perhaps
kipling
has
described
this
opinion
better
than
anybody
else
when
he
says
so
to
you
at
your
in
the
soudan
you
a
pore
benighted
but
a
fightin
man
an
to
you
with
your
of
you
big
black
boundin
beggar
for
you
broke
a
british
square
there
was
somewhat
of
a
mixture
of
my
sentiment
and
feeling
on
this
war
i
wanted
gordon
released
i
wanted
the
war
ended
and
the
soudanese
beaten
but
when
i
contrasted
the
spirit
of
the
campaign
with
the
spirit
of
jesus
i
often
wished
that
i
could
lend
my
assistance
to
these
black
men
of
the
desert
who
were
fighting
for
the
thing
under
their
feet
and
the
home
life
of
their
tribe
but
it
was
not
until
i
was
completely
out
of
the
desert
that
i
was
possessed
of
a
loathing
and
disgust
for
the
game
of
war
as
such
this
disgust
grew
until
i
had
completely
ridden
myself
not
only
of
the
war
spirit
but
of
the
paraphernalia
of
the
soldier
the
officer
whose
servant
i
was
was
so
hated
by
everybody
who
knew
him
that
if
he
had
ever
gotten
in
front
of
the
ranks
as
was
the
ancient
custom
in
war
he
would
have
been
the
first
man
to
drop
and
he
would
have
dropped
by
a
bullet
from
one
of
his
own
men
but
leaders
no
longer
lead
on
the
field
of
battle
they
follow
i
had
some
books
with
me
but
the
power
to
interest
myself
in
them
had
almost
completely
vanished
i
occupied
my
mind
very
largely
with
military
tactics
on
a
large
sheet
of
brown
paper
i
outlined
the
plan
of
campaign
on
it
i
had
the
position
of
every
regiment
in
our
army
the
dynamite
mines
the
region
of
broken
glass
the
furze
bushes
fort
and
redoubts
were
all
minutely
detailed
and
one
night
an
exigency
arose
in
which
this
paper
plan
of
campaign
was
called
into
evidence
tired
of
waiting
and
very
restive
and
discontented
under
the
privations
of
the
desert
graham
determined
to
move
the
apparatus
was
out
of
order
and
the
advance
forts
were
too
far
away
to
be
touched
with
any
less
powerful
signal
of
the
night
a
officer
was
ordered
to
take
a
corporal
guard
and
deliver
marching
orders
to
the
advanced
forts
when
questioned
as
to
the
route
he
was
not
quite
certain
as
to
the
exact
location
of
the
dynamite
mines
or
broken
glass
and
as
i
overheard
the
entire
conversation
i
produced
my
map
and
begged
the
honour
of
carrying
the
dispatch
this
was
not
granted
me
until
several
others
had
been
questioned
and
failed
i
was
so
sure
of
every
inch
of
the
ground
that
i
was
commissioned
to
take
two
men
with
me
and
deliver
the
orders
this
made
my
heart
leap
with
joy
it
was
a
relief
an
excitement
an
opportunity
osman
digna
men
were
stealthy
they
hid
behind
the
furze
bushes
in
the
darkness
so
often
and
so
many
of
our
men
had
been
hamstrung
that
of
course
we
were
on
the
alert
but
every
furze
bush
we
approached
covered
an
imaginery
and
this
often
repeated
created
an
unutterable
fear
so
that
by
the
time
we
reached
our
destination
our
khaki
clothing
was
black
with
sweat
and
we
were
literally
drenched
with
fear
of
course
we
put
on
a
brave
front
and
smiled
complacently
as
we
delivered
the
orders
and
when
it
was
suggested
that
we
remain
overnight
in
the
fort
i
nonchalantly
refused
the
offer
under
the
pretence
that
we
were
expected
back
the
same
thing
happened
on
the
return
journey
and
when
the
thing
was
over
we
were
the
most
objects
soldiers
some
months
later
when
it
was
announced
to
me
that
we
had
been
mentioned
in
dispatches
the
absurdity
of
the
thing
became
for
the
first
time
fully
apparent
according
to
the
ethics
of
military
life
i
had
done
a
brave
thing
something
worth
mentioning
but
to
my
own
soul
i
had
been
with
physical
fear
and
turn
it
over
as
i
might
i
could
not
discover
a
vestige
of
either
courage
or
fortitude
in
the
entire
transaction
the
phrase
everything
is
fair
in
love
and
war
covers
a
multitude
of
sins
in
both
departments
we
had
a
unique
way
of
finding
out
whether
the
wells
in
the
desert
were
poisoned
we
led
up
to
each
well
a
small
detachment
of
captives
and
made
them
drink
if
they
drank
we
could
drink
also
if
they
refused
we
took
it
for
granted
the
wells
were
poisoned
and
we
hanged
them
sometimes
this
extreme
sentence
was
mitigated
and
we
flogged
them
whatever
we
touched
we
destroyed
what
the
bullet
could
not
accomplish
the
torch
could
it
was
a
campaign
of
annihilation
the
news
of
gordon
death
cast
a
gloom
over
the
entire
army
this
of
course
meant
relief
and
return
home
but
no
man
wanted
to
return
we
were
seized
with
a
fiendish
impulse
to
proceed
at
all
hazards
to
khartoum
to
his
relief
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
government
was
of
course
out
of
the
question
and
we
were
ordered
home
transport
ships
were
lying
in
suakim
harbour
ready
for
the
journey
across
the
sea
but
this
could
not
be
accomplished
with
dispatch
a
garrison
had
to
be
left
to
watch
the
seaboard
the
detachment
of
which
i
was
a
part
was
returned
to
the
town
of
suakim
and
the
officers
were
quartered
in
an
unfinished
building
by
the
seaside
at
the
edge
of
the
water
the
officers
servants
lived
in
tents
pitched
on
the
roof
we
were
permitted
to
bathe
as
often
as
we
wished
the
harbour
was
full
of
sharks
and
rather
dangerous
for
bathing
but
the
soudanese
seemed
to
be
not
as
they
skimmed
over
the
water
in
their
the
journey
home
on
a
transport
was
a
continuation
of
the
misery
of
the
desert
what
the
desert
had
left
undone
to
weakened
men
the
rough
voyage
accomplished
the
ship
was
overcrowded
and
almost
every
day
dead
bodies
lashed
to
planks
were
pitched
over
the
side
the
sight
below
decks
of
scores
of
men
crawling
around
in
a
dying
condition
struck
terror
to
the
hearts
of
the
strong
the
smells
were
nauseating
and
the
food
was
vile
no
man
knew
when
his
turn
would
come
the
few
doctors
were
utterly
unable
to
cope
with
this
physical
collapse
of
so
many
men
the
condition
of
the
ship
and
of
the
men
furnished
me
with
the
best
opportunity
i
had
had
up
to
that
time
for
evangelistic
work
i
spent
twenty
hours
of
each
preaching
the
gospel
to
the
men
the
absence
of
a
chaplain
on
board
made
the
work
comparatively
easy
my
work
was
done
so
quietly
and
unobtrusively
that
it
was
practically
unknown
save
to
the
sick
and
the
dying
until
an
incident
happened
that
brought
me
somewhat
into
the
light
we
were
in
the
bay
of
biscay
and
those
who
were
well
were
fighting
off
the
atmosphere
of
disease
it
was
toward
evening
and
four
men
were
playing
cards
for
money
i
stood
watching
them
with
my
hands
behind
my
back
i
must
have
been
there
half
an
hour
when
the
man
directly
in
front
of
me
looking
around
and
staring
me
in
the
face
said
get
out
of
i
won
a
penny
since
you
been
watching
us
the
other
men
laughed
and
i
moved
away
excusing
myself
as
i
departed
but
before
i
was
out
of
hearing
one
of
the
men
addressed
the
speaker
and
said
do
be
too
sure
of
what
you
could
do
to
that
fellow
irvine
his
looks
belie
him
he
got
more
steam
in
his
elbow
than
you
have
that
was
all
i
heard
but
as
i
was
looking
over
the
side
a
minute
or
two
later
a
hand
was
laid
on
my
shoulder
i
looked
around
it
was
the
man
who
had
threatened
me
say
pal
he
said
i
did
mean
no
these
blokes
tell
me
as
yer
name
irvine
is
that
so
i
nodded
an
assent
did
yer
ever
a
chum
name
was
creedan
again
i
nodded
assent
d
know
what
became
ov
he
was
missing
on
the
field
i
replied
dead
said
the
man
then
he
described
to
me
the
last
moments
of
my
friend
it
appeared
that
creedan
and
this
man
fell
together
on
the
field
creedan
shot
through
the
abdomen
this
man
through
the
shoulder
an
officer
came
along
and
offered
creedan
a
mouthful
of
water
but
he
refused
saying
he
was
all
in
but
that
he
wanted
to
send
a
message
to
his
chum
and
this
is
the
message
he
gave
to
the
man
who
had
threatened
to
punch
my
head
tell
irvine
the
anchor
holds
i
was
moved
of
course
by
the
recital
of
this
story
so
was
the
man
who
told
it
what
in
did
mean
by
th
anchor
the
man
asked
old
man
i
said
i
had
been
trying
for
a
long
time
to
lead
creedan
to
a
religious
life
and
the
story
you
tell
is
the
only
evidence
that
i
ever
had
that
he
took
me
seriously
the
man
looked
as
if
he
were
going
to
weep
and
in
a
quivering
voice
he
asked
if
i
could
help
him
he
was
going
home
to
marry
a
maiden
in
kent
whom
he
described
as
a
pure
good
girl
he
felt
unworthy
for
he
was
a
gambler
and
a
periodical
drunkard
and
he
thought
that
if
a
man
like
creedan
could
be
helped
he
could
i
struck
the
iron
while
it
was
hot
and
said
there
is
a
good
deal
to
be
done
for
you
but
you
have
to
do
it
yourself
if
you
got
the
grit
in
you
to
face
these
fellows
and
make
a
confession
of
religion
right
here
and
now
i
will
guarantee
to
you
that
you
land
on
the
shores
of
england
a
new
man
he
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
with
a
stern
hard
face
then
he
said
by
god
i
do
it
there
was
no
profanity
in
this
assertion
it
was
the
strongest
way
he
could
put
it
and
we
dropped
on
our
knees
on
the
deck
and
began
to
pray
in
a
minute
or
two
half
a
dozen
others
joined
us
then
it
seemed
as
if
everybody
around
us
was
on
his
knees
and
then
when
i
felt
the
atmosphere
of
the
crowd
and
the
reverence
of
it
i
called
on
others
to
pray
half
a
dozen
others
responded
and
then
this
man
above
the
roar
of
the
wind
through
the
sails
and
the
creaking
of
the
boats
davits
prayed
to
god
to
make
him
a
new
man
creedan
had
been
drafted
from
the
ship
in
a
detachment
for
the
front
and
when
we
met
on
the
desert
we
entered
into
a
compact
which
stipulated
that
if
either
of
us
fell
on
the
field
of
battle
the
survivor
was
to
take
charge
of
the
deceased
effects
and
visit
his
people
the
arrival
of
the
troops
in
england
was
the
occasion
for
an
unusual
demonstration
we
were
banqueted
and
paraded
and
all
kinds
of
honours
were
showered
upon
us
as
we
marched
through
the
streets
in
our
uniforms
we
were
supposed
to
be
heroes
heroes
every
one
what
a
farce
the
whole
thing
seemed
to
me
nevertheless
i
was
inconsistent
enough
to
actually
enjoy
whatever
the
others
were
getting
having
purchased
my
discharge
by
the
payment
of
i
was
at
liberty
to
leave
at
my
pleasure
i
was
offered
a
lucrative
position
in
the
officers
mess
which
was
one
of
the
best
in
the
british
army
this
i
accepted
and
held
for
a
year
my
furlough
after
a
short
visit
to
ireland
i
spent
in
oxford
the
university
and
its
colleges
and
the
town
had
a
wonderful
fascination
for
me
but
i
think
as
i
look
back
at
it
and
try
to
sum
up
its
influence
upon
me
that
the
personality
of
the
master
of
balliol
benjamin
jowett
was
the
greatest
and
the
most
permanent
thing
i
received
i
had
been
striving
for
years
to
slough
off
from
my
tongue
a
thick
irish
brogue
and
had
not
succeeded
very
well
the
elegance
and
the
chasteness
of
jowett
english
did
more
for
me
in
this
respect
than
my
years
of
pruning
i
have
never
heard
such
english
and
behind
this
master
language
of
a
master
mind
there
was
a
man
a
gentleman
i
wrote
jowett
a
note
one
day
asking
for
an
interview
it
may
have
been
the
execrable
handwriting
that
interested
him
but
i
had
a
most
polite
note
in
return
stating
the
hour
at
which
he
would
be
glad
to
see
me
i
remember
attempting
in
a
very
awkward
childish
way
to
explain
to
him
something
of
my
ambition
to
make
progress
in
my
studies
and
how
poorly
prepared
i
was
and
how
handicapped
in
various
ways
he
rose
from
his
seat
took
down
a
book
from
a
shelf
consulted
it
and
put
it
back
and
then
he
told
me
in
a
few
words
of
a
spanish
soldier
who
had
entered
the
university
of
paris
at
the
age
of
and
became
an
influence
that
was
this
by
way
of
encouragement
the
model
held
up
had
very
little
effect
upon
me
but
this
personal
interview
this
close
touch
with
the
man
who
himself
was
a
model
was
a
great
inspiration
to
me
and
remains
with
me
one
of
the
most
pleasant
memories
of
my
life
my
first
lecture
was
given
in
the
town
hall
at
my
home
town
in
ireland
during
the
first
week
of
my
furlough
the
townspeople
filled
the
hall
more
out
of
curiosity
than
to
hear
the
lecture
for
when
the
cobbler
son
had
left
the
town
a
few
years
before
he
could
read
his
own
name
the
vicar
presided
ministers
of
other
denominations
were
present
the
young
men
christian
association
was
very
much
in
evidence
at
the
lecture
school
teachers
of
the
sunday
school
where
i
taught
were
present
the
class
of
little
boys
i
had
gathered
off
the
streets
was
there
but
personally
i
had
gone
after
the
newsboys
of
the
town
and
i
had
arranged
that
they
should
sit
in
a
row
of
front
seats
indeed
i
bribed
some
of
them
to
be
present
my
lecture
was
on
gordon
and
khartoum
i
described
our
life
on
the
desert
and
told
something
of
the
as
i
had
seen
it
played
at
the
close
of
the
lecture
the
usual
perfunctory
vote
of
thanks
was
moved
and
several
prominent
men
of
the
town
made
the
seconding
of
the
vote
an
excuse
for
a
speech
curiously
enough
i
had
had
an
experience
with
one
of
these
men
when
i
was
a
newsboy
and
in
my
reply
to
this
vote
of
thanks
i
told
the
story
one
winter
night
when
i
was
selling
papers
on
these
streets
i
think
i
was
about
twelve
years
of
age
i
knocked
at
a
man
door
and
asked
if
he
wanted
a
paper
the
streets
were
covered
with
snow
and
slush
and
i
was
shoeless
and
very
cold
the
man
of
the
house
opened
the
door
himself
and
something
must
have
disturbed
him
mentally
for
when
he
saw
it
was
a
newsboy
he
took
me
by
the
collar
and
threw
me
into
the
gutter
my
papers
were
spoiled
and
my
rags
soaked
with
slush
and
water
i
picked
myself
up
and
came
back
to
the
window
through
which
i
saw
a
bright
fire
on
an
open
hearth
and
around
it
the
man
family
i
think
i
said
any
bad
words
nor
do
i
think
i
was
very
angry
but
i
certainly
was
sad
and
i
made
up
my
mind
at
the
window
that
that
man
would
some
day
be
sorry
for
an
unnecessary
act
of
cruelty
i
am
glad
that
the
gentleman
is
present
a
deep
silence
and
breathlessness
pervaded
the
audience
for
i
am
sure
that
he
is
sorry
but
here
are
the
newsboys
of
the
town
they
are
my
invited
guests
i
want
to
say
to
the
townspeople
that
the
only
kindly
hand
ever
laid
on
my
head
was
the
vicar
it
is
too
late
now
to
help
me
i
am
beyond
your
reach
but
these
boys
are
here
and
they
are
serving
you
with
papers
and
earning
a
few
pennies
to
appease
hunger
or
to
clothe
their
bodies
and
i
want
you
to
be
kind
to
them
after
the
lecture
the
man
who
had
thrown
me
in
the
gutter
came
to
me
of
course
he
had
forgotten
it
he
had
not
the
slightest
idea
he
was
the
man
but
he
said
what
a
dastardly
shame
i
gripped
him
by
the
hands
and
said
you
my
brother
are
the
man
who
did
it
i
tightened
my
grip
and
said
and
i
forgive
you
as
fully
and
freely
as
i
possibly
can
you
are
sorry
and
i
am
satisfied
i
studied
in
the
military
schools
for
a
military
certification
of
education
and
got
my
promotion
but
no
sooner
had
the
studies
ceased
and
promotion
come
than
the
disgust
with
military
life
and
its
restrictions
increased
with
such
force
that
it
became
unbearable
so
i
left
the
service
chapter
vi
beginnings
in
the
new
world
i
came
to
the
united
states
in
september
i
came
as
a
steerage
passenger
my
first
lodging
on
american
soil
was
with
one
of
the
earth
saints
a
little
old
irish
woman
who
lived
on
east
street
new
york
city
i
had
served
in
egypt
with
her
son
and
i
was
her
guest
i
had
come
here
with
the
usual
idea
that
coming
was
the
only
problem
that
everybody
had
work
that
there
were
no
poor
people
in
this
country
that
there
was
no
problem
of
the
unemployed
i
was
disillusioned
in
the
first
few
weeks
for
i
tramped
the
streets
night
and
day
i
ran
the
gamut
of
the
employment
agencies
and
the
help
wanted
columns
of
the
papers
it
was
while
looking
for
work
that
i
first
became
acquainted
with
the
bowery
it
was
in
the
current
of
the
unemployed
that
i
was
swept
there
first
it
was
there
that
i
first
discovered
the
dimensions
of
the
problem
of
the
unemployed
and
my
first
great
surprise
in
the
country
was
to
find
thousands
of
men
in
what
i
supposed
to
be
the
most
wonderful
eldorado
on
earth
workless
and
many
of
them
homeless
an
advertisement
in
the
morning
paper
calling
for
a
whatever
that
might
mean
led
me
to
a
big
on
the
bowery
they
wanted
a
man
to
wash
the
floors
and
make
the
beds
up
and
the
pay
was
one
dollar
a
day
i
got
in
line
with
the
applicants
i
was
about
the
man
many
a
time
i
have
wished
that
i
could
understand
what
was
passing
in
the
clerk
mind
when
he
dismissed
me
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
i
thought
perhaps
that
my
dismissal
meant
that
he
had
engaged
a
man
but
that
was
not
the
case
a
man
two
or
three
files
behind
me
got
the
job
my
next
attempt
led
me
to
a
public
school
on
greenwich
avenue
the
janitor
wanted
an
assistant
i
was
so
weary
with
my
inactivity
that
any
kind
of
a
job
at
any
kind
of
pay
would
have
been
acceptable
the
janitor
showed
me
over
the
school
told
me
what
his
work
was
finally
he
took
me
to
the
cellar
where
he
had
piled
up
in
a
corner
about
twenty
lots
of
ashes
that
of
course
was
the
first
thing
to
be
done
and
though
the
pile
looked
rather
discouraging
i
stripped
to
the
work
and
went
at
it
my
task
was
to
get
the
ashes
outside
ready
for
carting
away
i
was
about
six
hours
on
the
job
when
i
accidently
overheard
the
janitor
say
to
his
wife
shut
your
mouth
i
have
just
got
a
sucker
of
a
greenhorn
to
get
them
out
that
was
enough
i
got
my
coat
and
hat
went
over
to
the
janitor
door
but
before
i
could
open
my
mouth
his
wife
said
what
up
oh
the
job
all
right
i
replied
but
what
i
object
to
is
the
way
you
do
your
whispering
the
lowest
in
the
scale
of
all
human
employments
is
the
art
of
canvassing
for
a
sewing
machine
company
i
did
it
for
two
weeks
my
teacher
taught
me
how
to
canvass
a
tenement
the
janitor
is
the
traditional
arch
enemy
of
the
canvasser
my
teaching
consisted
largely
in
how
to
avoid
him
circumvent
him
or
exploit
him
a
smith
a
mythical
smith
always
lived
on
the
top
floor
i
was
taught
to
interview
her
first
then
i
canvassed
from
the
top
down
my
district
was
on
the
east
side
from
fourteenth
to
street
i
encountered
some
rough
work
with
janitors
and
janitresses
in
this
region
so
rough
indeed
that
i
considered
it
a
splendid
missionary
field
and
when
i
found
crushed
in
the
heart
of
that
tenement
region
a
small
methodist
church
i
became
interested
in
its
work
i
copied
its
from
the
board
outside
the
door
and
began
as
time
permitted
to
attend
its
services
as
an
offset
to
the
discouragements
i
had
experienced
i
met
in
this
small
church
two
big
men
big
mentally
and
morally
they
were
brothers
and
during
my
years
in
the
united
states
i
have
not
met
their
superiors
they
were
lincoln
and
frank
moss
both
of
them
leaders
in
the
church
and
although
they
had
moved
with
the
population
northward
they
remembered
the
struggles
of
their
childhood
and
gave
to
it
some
of
their
best
manhood
selling
sewing
machines
was
a
failure
but
out
of
it
came
the
discovery
of
this
splendid
field
for
social
and
religious
activity
i
was
directed
to
the
street
there
day
after
day
i
inquired
at
the
employment
department
until
the
secretary
seemed
tired
of
the
sight
of
me
i
got
ashamed
to
look
at
him
one
night
i
sat
in
a
corner
the
picture
of
dejection
and
despair
when
a
big
man
sat
down
beside
me
you
look
as
if
you
thought
god
was
dead
he
said
smiling
he
appears
to
be
i
replied
he
put
his
big
hand
on
my
shoulder
looked
into
my
eyes
and
drew
out
of
me
my
story
i
forget
what
he
said
it
was
brief
and
perhaps
commonplace
but
i
went
out
to
walk
the
streets
that
night
full
of
hope
and
courage
before
leaving
that
night
i
approached
the
little
man
at
the
employment
desk
did
you
see
that
big
fellow
in
a
gray
suit
i
asked
yes
who
is
he
mr
mcburney
the
man
whose
name
is
on
your
letterhead
the
same
great
guns
and
to
think
that
i
been
monkeying
all
these
weeks
with
a
man
like
you
pardon
me
brother
robert
mcburney
was
my
friend
to
the
day
of
his
death
many
a
time
when
out
of
the
pit
i
reminded
him
of
the
incident
it
was
from
the
little
man
at
the
employment
desk
of
the
street
that
i
got
my
real
introduction
to
business
life
if
the
vocation
of
a
porter
can
be
called
business
i
became
an
in
a
wholesale
house
on
broadway
at
five
dollars
a
week
and
spent
a
winter
at
the
job
the
head
of
the
house
was
a
leader
of
national
reputation
in
his
particular
denomination
i
was
sitting
on
the
radiator
one
winter
morning
before
the
store
was
opened
when
the
chief
clerk
came
in
it
was
a
monday
morning
and
his
first
words
were
well
what
did
you
do
yesterday
i
taught
a
bible
class
led
a
people
meeting
and
preached
once
was
my
reply
he
looked
dumbfounded
do
you
do
that
often
he
asked
as
often
as
i
get
a
chance
i
answered
an
abiding
friendship
began
that
morning
between
us
this
man
might
have
been
a
member
of
the
firm
and
a
rich
man
by
this
time
but
he
had
a
conscience
and
it
would
not
permit
him
to
dishonestly
keep
books
which
his
employers
wanted
him
to
do
and
he
quit
my
next
job
was
running
an
elevator
in
an
office
building
on
west
street
it
was
one
of
the
variety
jerked
up
and
down
by
a
wire
cable
it
gave
me
a
good
opportunity
for
study
in
the
side
of
the
cage
i
had
an
arrangement
for
my
greek
grammar
this
of
course
could
not
escape
the
notice
of
the
business
men
and
if
i
was
a
few
seconds
late
in
answering
their
bell
they
always
looked
like
a
in
the
direction
of
my
grammar
one
of
my
passengers
on
that
elevator
was
sympathetic
his
name
was
bruce
price
an
architect
a
tall
fine
powerfully
built
man
who
had
a
kindly
word
for
me
every
morning
and
the
only
passenger
who
ever
deigned
to
shake
hands
with
me
as
if
i
were
a
human
being
after
that
i
mounted
a
and
served
milk
in
the
region
of
west
street
this
drop
into
the
cellars
of
the
gave
me
contact
from
another
angle
with
janitors
janitresses
and
servants
i
started
at
four
each
morning
i
did
not
finish
until
late
in
the
afternoon
but
i
had
all
of
sunday
off
i
found
my
way
by
the
touch
of
the
hand
and
very
soon
i
seemed
to
have
the
eyesight
of
a
cat
to
find
shafts
circuitous
turnings
in
the
of
large
apartment
houses
the
life
of
a
milkman
is
a
busy
one
but
i
found
time
to
mumble
my
greek
roots
as
i
trotted
in
and
out
of
the
cellars
my
grammar
when
weather
permitted
was
tied
open
to
a
bottle
in
the
cart
from
the
i
went
to
a
publishing
house
they
had
advertised
for
a
man
with
some
literary
ability
and
i
had
the
effrontery
to
apply
i
drove
the
in
front
of
the
door
and
with
my
working
clothes
bespattered
with
milk
and
grease
i
applied
personally
for
the
job
what
are
your
qualifications
the
manager
asked
what
kind
of
work
do
you
want
done
i
asked
in
reply
i
found
that
they
were
going
to
make
a
new
dictionary
of
the
english
language
but
their
method
of
making
it
obviated
the
necessity
for
scholarship
they
had
an
edition
of
webster
and
a
lot
of
the
newer
dictionaries
and
webster
was
to
be
the
basis
of
the
new
one
and
we
were
to
crib
and
transcribe
from
all
the
rest
i
was
the
third
man
employed
on
the
work
my
salary
to
begin
with
was
ten
dollars
a
week
the
word
salary
had
a
fine
sound
it
is
more
refined
than
wages
though
it
was
less
than
my
pay
as
a
milkman
after
working
a
month
i
had
the
temerity
to
outline
a
plan
for
a
dictionary
which
would
necessitate
the
most
profound
scholarship
in
america
this
plan
was
laughed
at
at
first
but
finally
adopted
and
it
took
seven
years
and
millions
of
dollars
and
hundreds
of
the
best
scholars
in
the
united
states
and
foreign
countries
to
complete
the
work
they
raised
my
salary
from
a
week
to
a
month
but
when
an
opening
came
to
work
as
a
missionary
among
the
bowery
lodging
houses
at
a
month
i
considered
it
the
opportunity
of
a
lifetime
and
in
entered
my
new
parish
the
bowery
chapter
vii
fishing
for
men
on
the
bowery
the
bowery
is
one
of
the
most
unique
thoroughfares
of
the
world
the
history
of
the
cheap
lodging
houses
to
which
i
was
commissioned
to
carry
the
gospel
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
phases
of
the
bowery
history
thomas
byrnes
has
described
the
lodging
house
of
the
bowery
as
a
breeding
place
of
crime
he
probably
did
not
know
that
the
cheap
lodging
house
had
its
origin
in
a
philanthropic
effort
it
was
in
somewhere
on
the
edge
of
a
financial
panic
that
the
first
lodging
house
of
this
type
was
organized
by
two
missionaries
rev
shauffler
and
the
rev
john
dooley
the
young
men
christian
association
of
the
bowery
found
a
lot
of
young
men
attending
its
meetings
who
were
homeless
and
their
endeavour
to
solve
this
problem
resulted
in
the
fitting
up
of
a
large
dormitory
on
spring
street
somebody
byrnes
says
a
howe
saw
a
business
opportunity
in
the
philanthropy
and
copied
the
dormitory
there
were
from
sixty
to
seventy
of
them
on
the
bowery
when
i
began
my
work
these
i
visited
every
day
of
the
week
there
was
a
glamour
and
a
fascination
about
it
in
the
that
held
me
in
its
grip
as
tightly
as
it
did
others
what
a
study
were
the
faces
many
of
them
pale
haggard
many
of
them
painted
how
sickly
they
looked
under
the
white
glare
of
the
arc
lights
that
fizzled
and
sputtered
overhead
many
of
its
shops
have
been
selling
out
below
cost
for
over
twenty
years
i
did
not
confine
myself
to
the
bowery
but
went
to
the
small
side
streets
around
chatham
square
they
were
also
filled
with
cheap
lodging
houses
the
lowest
of
these
were
called
bunk
houses
only
one
of
the
bunk
houses
remains
that
is
situated
at
no
mulberry
street
it
is
there
little
altered
from
the
day
i
first
entered
it
over
twenty
years
ago
the
price
for
lodging
ranges
from
seven
to
fifteen
cents
but
fifteen
cents
was
the
more
usual
price
my
headquarters
at
first
was
the
city
mission
church
on
broome
street
called
the
broome
street
tabernacle
and
to
it
i
led
thousands
of
weary
feet
the
minister
at
that
time
was
the
rev
tyndall
a
splendid
man
with
a
modern
mind
but
i
filled
his
tabernacle
so
full
of
the
weary
willies
of
the
bowery
that
tyndall
revolted
and
as
i
look
back
at
the
circumstance
now
he
was
fully
justified
in
his
revolt
tyndall
was
doing
a
more
important
work
than
i
was
more
fundamental
and
he
was
touching
the
family
life
of
the
community
and
he
saw
what
i
did
not
see
that
our
congregations
could
not
be
mixed
that
my
work
was
spoiling
his
i
did
not
see
it
then
i
see
it
now
so
i
betook
myself
to
another
church
and
this
other
church
got
a
credit
which
it
did
not
deserve
for
they
had
no
family
life
to
touch
it
was
a
church
at
chatham
square
and
its
usefulness
consisted
in
the
fact
that
it
was
situated
where
it
could
catch
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
i
spent
my
afternoons
in
the
lodging
houses
pocket
bible
in
hand
going
from
man
to
man
as
they
sat
there
workless
homeless
dejected
and
in
despair
i
very
soon
found
that
there
was
one
gospel
they
were
looking
for
and
willing
to
accept
it
was
the
gospel
of
work
so
in
order
to
meet
the
emergency
i
became
an
employment
agency
i
became
more
than
that
they
needed
clothing
and
food
and
i
became
a
junk
store
and
a
soup
kitchen
after
six
months
experience
in
the
work
i
had
a
story
to
tell
it
was
very
vivid
and
i
could
always
touch
the
tear
glands
of
a
congregation
with
it
and
stir
their
hearts
so
i
went
from
church
to
church
uptown
and
out
of
town
and
anywhere
and
told
the
story
of
my
congregation
on
the
bowery
the
result
was
not
by
any
means
a
solution
of
my
problem
nor
of
the
tramp
problem
but
carloads
of
old
clothes
and
money
to
pay
for
lodgings
there
was
such
a
terrific
tug
at
my
heartstrings
all
the
time
that
i
never
had
two
coats
to
my
own
back
or
a
change
of
clothing
in
hardly
any
department
as
for
money
i
was
as
they
were
most
of
the
time
penniless
everything
i
could
beg
or
borrow
went
into
the
work
at
the
close
of
the
first
year
the
results
were
rather
discouraging
i
got
a
number
of
men
work
but
very
few
had
made
good
hundreds
of
men
had
been
clothed
fed
and
lodged
but
they
had
passed
out
of
my
reach
i
knew
not
where
they
had
gone
scarcely
one
per
cent
ever
let
me
know
even
by
a
postal
card
what
had
become
of
them
or
how
they
fared
and
yet
my
work
was
called
successful
sunday
afternoons
with
a
baby
organ
on
my
shoulder
and
a
small
group
of
converts
and
helpers
following
closely
behind
i
went
down
the
bowery
and
held
meetings
in
about
half
a
dozen
houses
i
did
most
of
the
speaking
but
urged
the
converts
to
tell
their
own
stories
at
each
service
i
have
said
that
i
was
never
interfered
with
or
molested
in
the
work
and
the
following
incident
can
hardly
be
called
an
exception
a
prize
fighter
slightly
under
the
influence
of
liquor
tried
to
prevent
us
from
holding
a
meeting
one
afternoon
i
reasoned
with
him
you
do
seem
to
know
who
i
am
he
said
i
confessed
my
ignorance
well
he
said
i
connelly
the
prize
fighter
then
you
what
your
profession
calls
a
sure
he
replied
probably
you
are
not
aware
connelly
that
the
bible
has
something
to
say
about
bruisers
he
explained
that
being
a
roman
catholic
his
bible
was
different
from
mine
and
he
did
not
think
there
were
any
bruisers
in
his
bible
oh
you
are
mistaken
connelly
this
is
your
bible
i
have
with
me
and
i
produced
a
small
douey
bible
and
turning
over
the
pages
in
genesis
i
read
a
passage
which
i
thought
might
appeal
to
him
seed
of
the
woman
shall
bruise
the
serpent
head
i
suppose
you
know
who
the
woman
was
connelly
the
holy
virgin
he
inquired
yes
and
the
serpent
is
the
devil
and
he
has
been
pouring
firewater
into
you
and
has
been
making
you
say
things
you
would
not
otherwise
say
as
for
the
seed
of
the
woman
that
is
jesus
christ
and
this
douey
bible
of
yours
tells
you
that
jesus
christ
is
able
to
bruise
the
head
of
the
old
serpent
in
you
which
is
the
devil
that
sounded
rather
reasonable
to
the
retired
prize
fighter
and
he
quieted
down
and
we
proceeded
with
the
service
the
society
for
which
i
worked
occasionally
sent
down
visitors
to
be
shown
around
the
lodging
houses
and
often
i
took
them
in
there
myself
but
the
thing
grew
very
distasteful
to
me
for
i
never
got
hardened
or
calloused
to
the
misery
and
sorrow
of
the
situation
and
it
seemed
to
me
eminently
unfair
to
parade
them
about
the
last
man
i
took
around
was
sir
walter
besant
i
dined
with
him
at
the
brevoort
house
one
night
and
took
him
around
first
to
one
of
the
and
then
to
various
others
and
also
into
the
tenement
region
around
cherry
street
keep
close
to
me
i
told
besant
as
we
entered
the
bunk
house
linger
so
we
went
to
the
top
floor
the
strips
of
canvas
arranged
in
double
tiers
were
full
of
lodgers
the
floor
was
strewn
with
bodies
naked
half
naked
and
fully
clothed
we
had
to
step
over
them
to
get
to
the
other
end
there
was
a
stove
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
beside
it
a
dirty
old
lamp
shed
its
yellow
rays
around
but
by
no
means
lighted
the
dormitory
the
plumbing
was
open
and
the
odours
coming
therefrom
and
from
the
dirty
sweaty
bodies
of
the
lodgers
and
from
the
hot
air
of
the
stove
windows
and
doors
being
tightly
closed
made
the
atmosphere
stifling
and
suffocating
after
stepping
over
the
prostrate
bodies
from
one
end
of
the
dormitory
to
the
other
the
novelist
was
almost
overcome
and
when
we
got
back
to
the
door
he
begged
to
be
taken
to
the
open
air
when
we
got
to
chatham
square
he
said
take
me
to
a
drugstore
besant
knew
the
underworld
of
london
as
few
men
of
his
generation
knew
it
but
he
had
never
seen
anything
quite
so
bestial
so
debauched
and
so
low
as
the
on
mulberry
street
it
seems
strange
to
me
now
that
after
having
tramped
the
streets
of
new
york
with
the
unemployed
and
after
having
shared
their
misery
disappointment
and
despair
that
i
should
as
a
missionary
have
entirely
forgotten
it
and
that
after
years
of
experience
among
them
i
should
still
be
possessed
of
the
idea
that
men
of
this
grade
were
lazy
and
would
not
work
if
they
had
it
one
afternoon
in
a
i
was
so
possessed
of
this
idea
that
i
challenged
the
crowd
you
men
surely
do
not
need
any
further
evidence
of
my
interest
in
you
i
remarked
all
that
i
have
and
am
belongs
to
you
but
i
can
not
help
telling
you
of
my
conviction
that
most
of
you
are
here
because
you
are
lazy
now
if
any
man
in
the
house
is
willing
to
test
the
case
i
will
change
clothes
with
him
morning
and
show
him
how
to
find
work
the
words
had
scarcely
escaped
my
lips
when
a
man
by
the
name
of
tim
grogan
stood
up
and
accepted
the
challenge
i
made
an
appointment
to
meet
grogan
on
chatham
square
at
five
the
next
morning
before
i
met
him
i
had
done
more
thinking
on
the
question
of
the
unemployed
than
i
had
ever
done
in
my
life
i
balked
on
the
change
of
clothing
article
in
the
agreement
and
furnished
my
own
two
or
three
men
had
enough
courage
to
get
up
early
in
the
morning
and
see
tim
off
they
were
sceptical
about
my
intention
the
first
thing
that
we
did
was
to
try
the
piano
soap
and
other
factories
on
the
west
side
from
place
to
place
we
went
from
fourteenth
to
street
without
success
sometimes
under
pretence
of
business
and
by
force
of
the
power
to
express
myself
in
good
english
i
gained
an
entrance
to
the
superintendent
but
i
always
failed
to
find
a
job
we
crossed
the
city
at
street
and
went
down
the
east
side
wherever
men
were
working
we
applied
we
went
to
the
stevedores
on
the
east
side
but
they
were
all
full
up
for
god
sake
i
said
to
some
of
them
but
i
was
brushed
aside
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
i
never
felt
so
like
a
beggar
in
my
life
tim
trotted
at
my
heels
encouraging
me
with
whimsical
irish
phrases
one
of
which
i
remember
begorra
mister
the
hardest
work
for
sure
is
no
work
at
all
at
all
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
i
began
to
get
disturbed
then
i
decided
to
try
a
scheme
i
had
worked
over
for
hours
keep
close
to
me
now
tim
i
said
as
i
led
him
to
a
drugstore
at
the
corner
of
grand
street
and
the
bowery
sir
i
said
to
the
clerk
you
are
unaccustomed
to
giving
credit
i
know
but
perhaps
you
might
suspend
your
rule
for
once
and
trust
us
to
the
amount
of
five
cents
you
do
talk
like
a
bum
he
said
but
you
look
like
one
i
thanked
him
for
the
compliment
to
my
language
but
insisted
on
my
request
well
what
is
it
asked
the
clerk
with
somewhat
of
a
sneer
i
am
hungry
and
thirsty
i
have
looked
for
work
all
day
and
have
utterly
failed
to
find
it
now
i
have
a
scheme
and
i
know
it
will
work
oxalic
acid
eats
away
rust
if
i
had
five
cents
worth
i
could
earn
a
dollar
i
know
i
could
he
looked
curiously
at
me
for
a
moment
and
said
with
an
oath
by
i
been
on
the
bowery
a
good
many
years
and
have
been
sold
once
if
you
a
man
i
throw
up
my
job
i
got
the
acid
i
played
the
same
game
in
a
for
five
cents
worth
of
rags
then
i
went
to
a
hardware
store
on
the
square
and
got
credit
for
about
ten
cents
worth
of
brickdust
and
paste
i
took
tim
by
the
arm
and
led
him
across
the
west
side
of
chatham
square
there
used
to
be
a
big
drygoods
store
on
the
east
side
of
the
square
with
large
windows
and
underneath
the
windows
big
brass
signs
nothing
doing
said
the
floorwalker
as
i
asked
for
the
job
of
cleaning
them
nevertheless
when
he
turned
his
back
i
dropped
on
my
knees
and
cleaned
a
square
foot
did
it
inside
of
a
minute
say
boss
i
said
look
here
i
desperately
hard
up
i
want
to
make
money
and
i
want
to
make
it
honestly
i
will
clean
that
entire
sign
for
a
nickle
it
was
pity
that
moved
him
to
give
me
the
job
and
when
it
was
completed
i
offered
to
do
the
other
one
all
right
he
said
go
ahead
but
this
one
i
said
will
cost
you
a
dime
why
a
nickle
for
this
one
and
a
dime
for
the
other
he
asked
well
i
said
we
are
just
entering
business
in
the
first
case
i
charged
you
merely
for
the
work
done
in
the
second
i
charge
you
for
the
idea
what
idea
he
inquired
the
idea
that
cleanliness
is
part
of
any
business
man
capital
well
go
ahead
when
both
signs
were
polished
i
offered
to
do
the
big
windows
for
ten
cents
each
this
was
thirty
cents
below
the
regular
price
and
i
was
permitted
to
do
the
job
tim
of
course
took
his
cap
off
rolled
his
shirtsleeves
up
and
worked
with
a
will
beside
me
after
that
we
swept
the
sidewalk
earning
the
total
sum
of
cents
we
tried
to
do
other
stores
but
the
nationality
of
most
of
them
was
against
us
nevertheless
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
we
made
a
dollar
and
a
half
i
took
tim
to
beefsteak
john
and
we
had
dinner
then
i
began
to
boast
of
the
performance
and
to
warn
tim
that
on
the
following
sunday
afternoon
i
should
explain
my
success
to
the
men
in
the
yes
yes
indeed
yer
honour
said
tim
y
a
janyus
there
no
doubt
about
that
at
all
at
all
but
go
on
i
said
i
was
jist
switherin
said
tim
what
a
wontherful
thing
ut
is
that
a
man
kin
always
hev
worruk
whin
he
invints
ut
well
that
worth
knowing
tim
i
said
disappointedly
did
you
learn
anything
else
there
jist
one
thing
that
you
forgot
yer
honour
what
is
it
i
asked
begorra
you
forgot
that
if
all
the
brains
in
the
wor
put
together
they
cud
think
of
a
thrick
like
that
the
thrick
of
cleaning
a
window
wid
stuff
from
a
dhrugstore
they
aint
got
brains
why
have
they
ach
begorra
i
dunno
except
for
the
same
raisin
that
a
fish
no
horns
we
retraced
our
steps
to
the
drugstore
and
the
and
the
hardware
store
and
paid
our
bills
and
i
handed
over
what
was
left
to
tim
this
experiment
taught
me
more
than
it
taught
tim
it
made
a
better
student
of
me
i
had
investigated
the
cases
of
a
hundred
men
in
that
same
their
nationality
age
and
occupation
and
i
had
tried
to
find
out
the
cause
of
their
failure
and
my
superficial
inquiry
led
me
to
the
conclusion
that
the
use
of
intoxicating
liquor
was
the
chief
cause
the
following

the

despite
my
experience
with
tim
grogan
i
diagnosed
the
condition
of
these
men
as
being
entirely
due
to
strong
drink
i
went
back
over
the
ground
and
investigated
with
a
little
more
care
the
causes
that
led
them
to
drink
and
this
was
the
more
fruitful
of
the
two
investigations
i
wondered
why
men
would
not
even
stick
at
a
job
when
i
got
them
work
a
careful
investigation
led
me
to
the
belief
that
when
a
man
gets
out
of
a
job
once
he
loses
just
a
little
of
the
routine
the
continuity
the
habit
of
work
and
it
is
just
a
little
harder
to
apply
himself
when
he
begins
again
if
a
man
loses
a
job
two
or
three
times
in
a
year
it
is
just
as
many
times
harder
to
go
on
with
a
regular
job
when
it
comes
lack
of
regular
employment
is
the
cause
not
only
of
the
physical
disintegration
but
of
the
moral
disintegration
also
so
these
men
who
had
been
out
of
employment
so
often
actually
could
not
stick
at
a
job
when
they
got
it
they
were
disorganized
a
few
of
them
had
the
stamina
to
overcome
this
disorganization
i
found
the
same
to
be
true
in
morals
when
a
man
made
his
first
break
it
was
easier
to
make
the
second
and
it
was
as
easy
for
him
to
lose
a
good
habit
as
to
acquire
a
bad
one
the
same
thing
holds
good
in
what
we
call
charity
a
terrific
goes
on
in
every
man
and
woman
before
the
hand
is
put
out
for
the
first
time
is
a
tremendous
asset
and
people
hold
on
to
it
as
to
their
very
souls
but
when
a
hand
is
held
out
once
and
the
community
puts
alms
therein
the
fabric
of
begins
to
totter
and
the
whole
process
of
disintegration
begins
chapter
viii
a
and
some
men
i
made
my
headquarters
while
a
missionary
in
the
mulberry
street
it
was
only
a
block
from
chatham
square
and
central
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
clean
it
i
proceeded
with
soap
and
water
to
scrub
it
out
dressed
in
a
pair
of
overalls
while
performing
this
operation
a
tall
gaunt
figure
lurched
into
the
room
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
a
slit
for
a
mouth
shaggy
eyebrows
rather
small
eyes
he
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
as
if
in
astonishment
and
then
he
said
hello
bub
what
de
game
i
a
missionary
i
answered
ye
are
eh
yes
when
i
finish
cleaning
the
floor
i
am
going
to
attempt
to
clean
up
some
other
things
around
here
me
too
hey
yes
do
you
think
you
need
it
he
laughed
a
hoarse
gutteral
laugh
and
said
do
get
bughouse
boss
ye
wind
up
just
where
ye
begun
on
the
floor
this
man
who
was
known
in
the
as
gar
was
known
also
by
the
names
of
mcbriarty
and
brady
he
had
been
in
the
army
but
they
could
not
drill
him
he
had
spent
fifteen
years
in
state
prison
for
various
offences
but
for
a
good
many
years
he
had
been
bungling
around
in
cheap
lodging
houses
getting
a
living
by
his
wits
he
was
the
toughest
specimen
of
a
man
i
ever
saw
there
was
a
challenge
in
him
which
i
at
once
accepted
it
was
in
his
looks
and
in
his
words
it
was
an
intimation
that
he
was
master
that
missionaries
were
somewhat
and
had
to
do
with
weak
people
i
was
not
very
well
acquainted
with
the
at
the
time
but
i
outlined
a
plan
of
campaign
the
major
part
of
which
was
the
capture
of
this
primordial
man
could
i
reach
him
could
i
influence
and
move
him
to
a
better
life
if
not
what
was
the
use
of
trying
my
theological
programme
on
others
so
i
abandoned
myself
to
the
task
i
knew
my
friends
and
the
officers
of
the
missionary
society
would
have
considered
it
very
if
the
details
of
the
plan
had
been
known
to
them
so
i
slept
in
the
and
stayed
with
him
night
and
day
of
course
i
would
not
have
done
it
if
i
had
not
seen
beyond
him
that
if
i
could
gain
this
man
i
would
gain
a
strategic
point
he
himself
would
be
a
great
power
in
the
first
of
all
because
he
was
physically
fit
he
was
selected
because
he
could
pitch
any
two
men
in
the
house
out
of
it
and
even
from
a
missionary
point
of
view
that
was
important
he
resented
at
first
my
interference
but
gentleness
and
love
prevailed
and
he
finally
acquiesced
the
hardest
part
of
the
plan
was
to
eat
with
him
in
an
underground
restaurant
where
meals
cost
five
and
ten
cents
a
piece
when
he
was
tapering
off
i
went
with
him
into
the
saloons
he
visited
the
cheap
fake
and
would
buy
little
pieces
of
cheap
jewelry
occasionally
and
sell
them
at
a
few
cents
profit
these
things
nauseated
me
there
was
no
hope
of
finding
this
man
any
work
he
did
not
want
work
anyway
could
not
work
if
he
had
it
he
tried
during
the
first
week
that
i
was
with
him
to
disgust
me
first
with
his
language
and
then
with
his
actions
he
put
the
lights
out
in
the
dormitory
one
night
and
in
the
darkness
pulled
three
or
four
men
out
of
the
bunks
cuffed
them
on
the
side
of
the
head
and
kicked
them
around
generally
he
thought
this
was
the
finishing
touch
to
my
vigil
when
the
superintendent
came
up
and
lit
the
lamp
again
he
had
an
idea
that
it
was
the
bouncer
and
came
over
to
his
cot
which
was
beside
mine
and
found
him
snoring
when
all
was
quiet
the
bouncer
said
to
me
what
did
ye
tink
of
it
boss
hey
oh
i
said
that
was
a
very
tame
show
and
utterly
uninteresting
gee
he
said
you
must
have
been
a
barker
at
coney
island
the
test
of
my
theology
on
him
proved
a
failure
the
story
of
the
prodigal
son
was
a
great
joke
to
him
he
said
of
it
say
bub
if
you
ever
strike
an
old
gazabo
as
soft
as
dat
one
lem
me
know
will
ye
prayer
to
him
was
talking
through
one
hat
in
a
few
weeks
he
straightened
up
and
began
to
give
me
very
fine
assistance
in
the
his
change
of
mind
and
heart
almost
lost
him
his
job
for
he
lost
a
good
deal
of
his
brutality
the
thing
that
fitted
him
for
his
work
in
ushering
insubordinate
gentlemen
downstairs
he
did
it
more
with
force
of
persuasion
than
with
the
force
of
his
shoe
he
continued
my
campaign
of
cleaning
and
decorated
the
kalsomined
walls
with
chromos
that
he
bought
at
one
penny
apiece
he
was
a
psychologist
and
would
have
probably
been
surprised
if
anybody
had
told
him
so
he
could
tell
at
once
the
moral
worth
of
a
lodger
so
he
was
a
very
good
lieutenant
and
picked
out
the
best
of
the
men
who
had
reached
the
bottom
and
the
was
the
bottom
rung
of
the
social
ladder
every
day
he
had
his
story
to
tell
of
the
newcomers
and
their
possibilities
his
conversion
was
a
matter
of
slow
work
indeed
i
do
know
what
conversion
meant
in
his
case
it
certainly
was
not
the
working
out
of
any
theological
formula
that
i
had
preached
to
him
the
telling
of
this
man
story
in
churches
helped
the
work
a
great
deal
it
was
the
kind
of
thing
that
appealed
to
the
churches
rather
graphic
and
striking
so
unconsciously
we
exploited
him
we
could
have
gotten
a
hundred
dollars
to
help
a
man
like
this
whose
life
after
all
was
past
or
nearly
past
to
one
dollar
we
could
get
for
the
work
of
saving
a
boy
from
such
a
life
among
the
most
interesting
characters
that
i
came
in
contact
with
in
those
days
was
dave
ranney
he
is
now
himself
a
missionary
to
the
bowery
lodging
houses
i
was
going
across
chatham
square
one
night
when
this
man
tapped
me
on
the
shoulder
touched
me
he
would
call
it
he
was
a
puddler
from
pittsburg
so
he
said
show
me
your
hands
i
replied
instead
he
stuck
them
deep
into
his
trouser
pockets
and
i
told
him
to
try
again
he
said
he
was
hungry
so
i
took
him
to
a
restaurant
but
he
could
eat
he
wanted
a
drink
but
i
would
give
that
to
him
he
walked
the
streets
that
night
but
he
came
to
me
later
and
i
helped
him
and
every
time
he
came
he
got
a
little
nearer
the
truth
in
telling
his
story
finally
i
got
it
all
he
squared
himself
and
began
the
fight
of
his
life
another
convert
of
the
was
edward
dowling
der
an
old
gazabo
here
said
the
bouncer
to
me
one
day
and
he
got
de
angel
goods
on
him
he
was
a
quiet
reticent
old
man
of
sixty
an
irishman
who
had
served
in
the
british
army
in
india
with
havelock
and
colin
campbell
he
had
bought
a
ranch
in
the
west
but
an
accident
to
one
of
his
eyes
forced
him
to
spend
all
his
money
to
save
the
other
one
he
drifted
in
to
new
york
penniless
and
without
a
friend
seeing
a
tinker
mending
umbrellas
one
day
on
the
street
he
sat
down
beside
him
and
watched
the
process
in
that
way
he
learned
something
of
the
trade
one
sunday
afternoon
when
i
was
rallying
a
congregation
in
the
i
found
him
on
his
cot
reading
the
life
of
buffalo
bill
i
invited
him
down
to
the
meeting
but
he
politely
refused
saying
that
he
was
an
episcopalian
the
following
sunday
he
did
come
and
his
was
the
most
striking
spiritual
crisis
that
i
had
ever
seen
his
conversion
was
definite
and
clear
it
was
of
a
kind
with
the
conversion
of
paul
on
the
way
to
damascus
he
was
an
exceedingly
intelligent
man
and
could
repeat
more
classic
poetry
by
heart
than
any
man
i
have
ever
known
he
came
out
from
that
brown
mass
of
human
flotsam
and
jetsam
on
the
sunday
afternoon
following
his
conversion
and
told
them
what
had
happened
to
him
the
lodgers
were
very
much
impressed
it
was
in
the
the
old
man
earned
very
little
money
at
his
new
trade
but
what
he
had
he
shared
with
his
the
bouncer
told
me
that
the
old
tinker
would
buy
a
stale
loaf
for
a
few
cents
then
in
the
dormitory
he
would
make
coffee
in
tomato
cans
and
gather
half
a
dozen
of
the
hungriest
around
him
and
share
his
meal
with
them
plain
bread
soaked
in
unsweetened
coffee
sometimes
he
would
read
a
few
verses
of
the
bible
to
them
and
sometimes
merely
say
in
his
clear
irish
voice
there
now
god
bliss
ye
illustration
dowling
tinker
and
colporter
a
veteran
who
served
in
india
under
havelock
and
colin
campbell
at
this
time
he
was
living
on
a
dollar
a
week
but
every
morning
he
had
his
little
around
the
old
stove
his
word
of
greeting
and
his
final
word
of
benediction
to
the
men
he
had
selected
to
share
in
his
bounty
as
they
slunk
out
of
the
to
begin
the
day
later
he
had
a
new
testament
out
of
which
he
read
a
verse
or
two
every
morning
at
the
meal
very
soon
the
three
hundred
lodgers
began
to
look
upon
him
with
a
kind
of
awe
this
was
not
because
he
had
undergone
a
radical
change
for
he
had
always
been
quiet
gentle
and
civil
but
because
he
had
found
his
voice
and
that
voice
was
bringing
to
them
something
they
could
not
get
elsewhere
sympathy
cheer
and
courage
in
the
tenement
region
particularly
in
the
little
back
alleys
around
mulberry
street
he
mended
pots
kettles
pans
and
umbrellas
not
always
for
money
but
as
often
for
the
privilege
of
reading
to
these
people
messages
of
comfort
out
of
his
new
testament
going
down
mulberry
street
one
morning
in
the
depth
of
winter
i
happened
to
glance
up
one
of
those
narrow
alleys
in
the
bend
and
i
noticed
my
friend
standing
at
a
window
his
face
close
to
a
broken
pane
of
glass
and
his
large
new
testament
held
in
front
of
him
a
few
inches
from
his
face
his
tinker
budget
was
by
his
feet
the
door
was
closed
in
a
few
minutes
he
closed
the
book
put
it
into
his
kit
and
as
he
moved
away
from
the
window
i
saw
a
large
bundle
of
rags
pushed
into
the
hole
what
have
you
been
doing
i
inquired
he
laughed
there
now
god
bliss
her
he
said
i
put
a
rib
in
an
umbrella
for
her
but
she
said
the
house
was
too
dirty
to
read
the
bible
in
so
she
let
me
read
it
through
the
broken
window
all
that
winter
he
tinkered
and
taught
all
winter
the
little
ragged
audiences
gathered
around
him
in
the
morning
and
often
at
eventime
when
he
retreated
into
a
quiet
corner
to
be
silent
and
rest
he
found
himself
the
centre
of
an
inquiring
group
of
his
instead
of
uniting
himself
to
the
mission
as
such
men
usually
do
after
their
conversion
i
advised
him
to
join
one
of
the
prominent
churches
of
the
city
in
the
downtown
district
i
thought
it
would
be
good
for
the
church
but
we
both
discovered
our
mistake
later
he
was
utterly
out
of
keeping
with
his
surroundings
the
church
he
joined
was
an
institution
for
the
favoured
few
and
dowling
was
a
tinker
his
diary
of
that
period
is
before
me
as
i
write
and
i
am
astonished
at
the
great
humility
of
this
man
he
had
been
asked
by
the
minister
of
his
church
to
call
on
him
but
his
modesty
prevented
him
until
hunger
forced
him
to
change
his
mind
after
starving
for
three
days
he
made
up
his
mind
to
accept
that
invitation
and
reveal
his
condition
to
the
minister
of
this
church
he
was
poorly
clad
it
was
a
very
cold
winter
day
the
streets
were
covered
with
slush
and
snow
on
his
way
he
met
an
old
woman
with
a
shawl
around
her
a
bedraggled
dress
and
wet
feet
my
good
woman
said
dowling
you
must
be
very
cold
indeed
in
this
condition
sir
she
answered
i
am
cold
but
i
am
also
starving
of
hunger
could
you
afford
me
one
cent
to
get
some
bread
god
bliss
ye
dear
friend
he
said
i
have
not
been
able
to
taste
food
for
three
days
myself
but
i
am
now
on
the
way
to
the
house
of
a
good
friend
a
good
servant
of
the
lord
and
if
i
get
any
help
i
will
share
it
with
you
i
am
a
poor
tinker
but
work
has
been
very
slack
this
last
week
i
have
not
earned
enough
to
pay
for
my
lodging
the
diary
gives
all
the
details
the
corner
of
the
street
where
he
met
her
the
hour
of
the
day
a
servant
ushered
him
into
the
parlour
of
his
good
friend
the
servant
of
the
lord
presently
the
reverend
doctor
came
down
somewhat
irritated
and
without
shaking
hands
said
dowling
i
know
i
have
asked
you
several
times
to
call
but
i
am
a
very
busy
man
and
you
should
have
let
me
know
i
simply
can
not
see
you
this
morning
i
have
an
address
to
prepare
for
the
opening
of
a
mission
and
i
have
the
time
no
handshake
no
christian
greeting
records
the
tinker
diary
and
the
account
closes
with
these
words
dear
lord
do
not
let
the
demon
of
uncharitableness
enter
into
my
poor
heart
he
became
a
colporteur
for
a
tract
society
and
was
given
as
territory
the
towns
on
the
east
side
of
the
hudson
river
tract
selling
in
this
generation
is
probably
the
most
thankless
profitless
work
that
any
human
being
could
undertake
the
poor
old
man
was
burdened
with
a
heavy
bundle
of
the
worst
literary
trash
of
a
religious
kind
ever
put
out
of
a
publishing
house
he
was
to
get
per
cent
on
the
sales
so
he
shouldered
his
kit
with
his
heart
full
of
enthusiasm
and
began
the
summer
journey
on
foot
he
carried
his
diary
with
him
and
although
the
entries
are
very
brief
they
are
to
the
point
august
sold
nothing
no
money
for
bread
or
lodging
is
night
came
and
i
was
tired
and
hungry
i
went
into
a
grove
and
with
a
prayer
of
confidence
on
my
lips
i
went
to
sleep
a
clock
not
far
away
struck
two
then
rain
fell
in
torrents
and
a
fierce
wind
blew
the
elements
drove
me
from
the
grove
a
constable
held
me
up
am
a
servant
of
god
dear
friend
i
said
does
he
give
you
a
place
to
sleep
then
he
answered
forgive
me
thinks
i
to
myself
that
is
the
same
unworthy
thought
that
was
in
my
own
mind
i
went
into
a
building
in
course
of
erection
and
lay
down
on
some
planks
but
i
was
too
wet
to
sleep
next
day
hunger
drove
him
to
work
early
he
was
turned
from
one
door
after
another
by
saints
and
sinners
alike
until
finally
he
was
so
weak
with
hunger
that
he
could
scarcely
walk
then
he
became
desperate
to
a
degree
and
his
diary
records
a
call
on
another
reverend
doctor
this
eminent
divine
had
no
need
for
religious
literature
nor
had
he
time
to
be
bothered
with
beggars
dowling
records
in
his
diary
that
he
told
the
minister
that
he
was
dropping
off
his
feet
with
hunger
and
would
be
thankful
for
a
little
bread
and
a
glass
of
water
it
seems
almost
incredible
that
in
a
christian
community
such
things
could
happen
but
the
diary
records
the
indictment
that
those
tender
lips
in
life
were
never
allowed
to
utter
it
records
how
he
was
driven
from
the
door
he
had
letters
of
introduction
from
this
rich
tract
society
and
again
he
presented
them
to
a
minister
a
very
nice
lady
came
says
the
record
i
gave
my
credentials
explained
my
condition
and
implored
help
are
retired
from
the
active
the
woman
said
and
can
not
help
you
we
have
no
further
use
for
religious
books
a
third
minister
atoned
for
the
others
and
made
a
purchase
this
was
at
tarrytown
on
another
occasion
when
his
vitality
had
ebbed
low
through
hunger
and
exposure
he
was
sitting
on
the
roadside
when
a
labourer
said
there
is
a
nigger
down
the
road
here
who
keeps
a
saloon
he
has
got
no
religion
but
he
wants
some
ye
better
look
him
up
and
he
did
the
negro
informed
him
that
being
a
shut
him
and
his
family
from
the
church
now
he
said
i
am
going
to
get
jim
my
barkeeper
to
look
after
the
joint
while
i
take
you
home
to
talk
to
me
and
my
family
about
god
so
they
entertained
the
and
the
diary
is
full
of
praise
to
god
for
his
friends
the
negro
bought
a
dollar
worth
of
tracts
and
persuaded
the
colporteur
to
spend
the
night
with
them
with
this
dollar
he
returned
to
new
york
got
his
tinker
budget
and
went
back
to
his
missionary
field
if
people
did
not
want
their
souls
cured
he
knew
they
must
have
lots
of
tinware
that
needed
mending
so
he
combined
the
work
of
curing
souls
with
the
mending
of
umbrellas
and
kitchen
utensils
and
his
period
of
starvation
was
past
his
business
was
to
preach
the
new
vision
and
tinker
for
a
living
as
he
went
along
september
reads
the
diary
i
found
myself
by
the
brook
which
runs
east
of
the
mountain
i
had
a
loaf
of
bread
and
some
cheese
and
with
a
tin
cup
i
helped
myself
to
the
water
of
the
brook
the
fragments
that
remained
i
put
in
a
bundle
and
tied
to
the
branch
of
a
tree
by
the
roadside
on
the
wrapper
i
pencilled
these
words
if
you
come
across
this
food
and
you
need
it
do
not
hesitate
to
eat
it
but
if
you
do
need
it
leave
it
for
i
will
return
at
the
close
of
the
day
god
bless
you
at
eventime
he
returned
and
was
surprised
at
the
altered
shape
of
the
bundle
he
found
that
two
beef
sandwiches
and
two
big
apples
had
been
added
with
this
note
friend
accept
these
by
way
of
variety
peace
to
thee
this
gives
occasion
for
another
address
of
prayer
and
gratitude
to
god
for
his
bountiful
care
by
the
brookside
he
took
supper
and
then
began
the
ascent
of
the
hill
after
a
few
hours
fruitless
search
for
the
road
he
got
stuck
in
the
words
of
the
diary
finding
himself
in
a
helpless
predicament
he
gathered
grass
and
dry
leaves
around
him
and
prepared
himself
for
the
night
psalms
iv
came
to
my
mind
he
said
and
i
took
great
comfort
in
the
words
said
i
will
both
lay
me
down
in
peace
and
sleep
for
thou
lord
makest
me
dwell
in
safety
he
woke
next
morning
and
found
the
earth
covered
with
hoar
frost
which
suggested
to
him
purge
me
with
hyssop
and
i
shall
be
clean
wash
me
and
i
shall
be
whiter
than
snow
one
of
my
duties
while
engaged
as
a
missionary
on
the
bowery
was
to
render
reports
of
the
work
done
for
the
missionary
society
the
society
had
a
monthly
magazine
and
it
was
through
that
medium
that
they
got
the
greater
part
of
their
support
in
one
of
my
reports
i
told
the
story
of
a
london
waif
the
story
made
such
an
impression
upon
the
superintendent
that
he
thought
i
was
romancing
and
said
so
my
best
answer
to
that
was
to
produce
the
boy
and
i
produced
him
the
boy
told
his
own
story
then
it
was
published
in
a
magazine
and
produced
a
strong
impression
i
think
an
extra
edition
had
to
be
printed
to
supply
the
demand
chapter
ix
the
waif
story
i
know
nothing
about
my
father
said
the
boy
to
me
my
mother
worked
in
the
not
far
from
our
cottage
where
we
lived
together
i
went
to
school
for
two
years
and
learned
to
read
and
write
a
little
every
evening
i
used
to
go
to
the
bend
in
the
road
and
meet
my
mother
as
she
came
home
she
was
always
very
tired
so
tired
she
carried
clay
on
her
head
all
day
and
it
was
heavy
i
used
to
make
the
fire
and
boil
the
supper
and
run
all
the
errands
to
the
grocery
one
evening
at
the
bend
of
the
road
i
waited
for
my
mother
until
it
was
dark
but
she
did
not
come
then
i
went
home
crying
i
found
my
mother
lying
on
the
bed
with
her
clothes
on
she
would
not
wake
up
i
shook
her
by
the
arm
i
rolled
her
from
one
side
to
the
other
but
she
would
not
speak
then
i
got
on
my
knees
and
i
kissed
her
and
her
face
was
very
cold
i
was
scared
i
went
for
the
old
woman
who
lived
next
door
she
shook
her
then
she
cried
and
told
me
that
my
mother
was
dead
my
mother
used
to
play
with
me
at
night
and
sometimes
in
the
morning
too
when
they
told
me
she
was
dead
i
wondered
what
i
would
do
without
her
but
all
the
neighbours
were
so
kind
to
me
that
i
forgot
a
good
deal
about
my
mother
until
they
put
her
in
a
box
and
carried
her
away
then
one
of
the
neighbour
women
took
me
and
said
i
must
live
with
her
so
i
did
i
sold
papers
ran
errands
dried
the
dishes
swept
the
floor
for
her
but
after
a
long
time
she
began
to
speak
very
crossly
to
me
and
i
often
trembled
with
fear
one
day
i
decided
to
run
away
after
i
sold
all
my
papers
i
came
to
the
cottage
and
slipped
all
the
pennies
under
the
door
and
then
ran
away
as
fast
as
i
could
i
did
not
know
where
i
was
going
but
i
had
heard
so
much
about
london
that
i
thought
it
must
be
a
very
great
place
and
that
i
could
get
papers
to
sell
and
do
lots
of
other
things
so
when
a
man
found
me
sitting
on
the
side
of
the
road
and
asked
me
where
i
was
going
i
said
london
he
laughed
and
said
do
you
know
there
i
replied
there
are
lots
of
people
there
and
lots
of
work
and
i
do
like
the
place
where
i
live
the
man
took
me
to
his
house
and
kept
me
all
night
and
paid
my
carfare
to
london
next
day
many
days
and
many
nights
i
had
no
food
to
eat
nor
no
place
to
sleep
i
did
not
like
to
beg
not
because
i
thought
it
wrong
but
because
i
was
afraid
i
saw
boys
carrying
packages
along
the
street
found
out
how
they
got
it
to
do
and
imitated
them
earning
occasionally
a
few
pennies
i
saved
up
enough
with
these
pennies
to
buy
a
stock
of
london
papers
by
saving
these
pennies
and
eating
little
food
i
was
able
to
buy
a
larger
stock
of
these
papers
each
day
i
had
good
luck
and
by
economy
i
managed
to
live
and
save
in
a
few
days
i
was
able
to
pay
a
night
for
a
lodging
one
night
when
i
made
a
big
venture
in
spending
all
my
money
on
a
big
stock
of
papers
i
had
an
accident
in
which
they
were
all
spoiled
i
dropped
them
in
a
pool
of
water
and
i
was
penniless
again
that
night
late
i
went
up
the
white
stone
steps
of
a
big
house
in
westminster
and
went
to
sleep
i
had
saved
a
few
of
the
driest
papers
and
used
them
as
a
pillow
little
cove
a
policeman
said
as
he
poked
his
baton
under
my
armpit
next
morning
are
you
doing
here
i
began
to
whimper
and
he
took
pity
on
me
and
showed
me
the
way
to
barnardo
home
but
when
i
got
out
of
his
sight
i
went
off
in
another
direction
for
i
had
heard
that
many
boys
got
whipped
down
there
i
got
among
a
lot
of
boys
on
the
banks
of
the
river
they
were
diving
for
pennies
i
thought
it
was
a
very
hard
way
to
earn
money
but
i
did
it
too
and
got
about
as
much
as
the
rest
i
did
not
stay
long
on
the
river
bank
the
boys
were
sharper
than
i
was
and
could
cheat
me
out
of
my
pennies
one
night
i
slept
under
an
arch
next
morning
i
heard
the
loud
sound
of
factory
whistles
everybody
was
aroused
some
of
the
people
lying
around
were
going
to
work
there
and
i
thought
i
might
get
a
job
also
so
i
followed
them
on
the
way
we
came
to
a
coffee
stall
and
as
i
was
nearly
fainting
with
hunger
i
stood
in
front
of
it
to
get
the
smell
of
the
coffee
and
fresh
bread
for
that
does
a
fellow
a
heap
of
good
when
he
got
nothing
in
his
stomach
a
man
with
a
square
paper
hat
on
looked
at
me
and
said
up
little
i
said
nothing
was
up
except
that
i
was
hungry
then
he
stepped
up
to
the
and
gave
him
some
money
and
i
got
a
bun
and
a
mug
of
coffee
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
never
been
so
happy
in
all
my
life
as
with
the
feeling
i
got
from
that
bun
and
coffee
but
then
i
had
been
a
good
many
days
without
food
there
was
no
work
to
be
had
at
the
factory
near
the
bridge
so
i
went
back
to
the
docks
at
night
i
slept
with
a
lot
of
other
fellows
under
a
big
canvas
cover
that
kept
the
rain
from
some
goods
lying
at
the
docks
ready
to
be
shipped
i
think
there
must
have
been
as
many
fellows
under
that
big
cover
as
there
were
piles
of
goods
it
was
while
there
that
i
thought
for
the
first
time
very
seriously
about
my
mother
and
i
began
to
cry
the
other
fellows
heard
me
and
kicked
me
from
under
the
cover
but
that
did
not
help
my
crying
however
i
smothered
a
good
deal
of
it
and
walked
up
and
down
by
the
side
of
the
river
all
night
my
eyes
were
swollen
and
i
was
feeling
very
badly
when
a
sailor
noticed
me
he
had
been
to
sea
and
had
just
returned
home
he
talked
a
lot
about
life
on
a
ship
said
if
he
were
a
boy
he
would
not
hang
around
the
docks
he
would
go
to
sea
yer
folks
he
said
to
me
got
none
i
said
d
live
then
do
live
nowheres
my
timbers
he
said
must
have
an
anchorage
in
some
of
these
parts
where
d
sleep
nights
i
be
when
night
comes
on
i
told
him
the
sailor
laughed
and
said
i
was
a
lucky
dog
to
be
at
home
anywheres
here
young
the
sailor
said
been
up
agin
it
in
these
parts
myself
when
i
was
a
kid
and
up
agin
it
stiff
too
and
there
ai
nothing
around
here
for
the
likes
of
ye
take
my
advice
and
get
out
o
here
there
a
big
ship
down
here
by
the
docks
sneak
aboard
get
into
a
scupper
or
a
barrel
or
something
and
ship
for
america
the
idea
of
aboard
got
very
big
in
my
mind
and
i
went
to
woolwich
where
the
ship
was
lying
and
i
met
a
lot
of
other
boys
who
were
trying
to
sneak
aboard
too
i
thought
my
chances
were
slim
but
i
was
going
to
have
a
try
anyway
these
boys
that
were
thinking
of
the
same
thing
tried
to
get
me
to
do
a
lot
of
things
that
i
knew
were
not
right
there
was
stuff
to
steal
and
they
knew
how
i
could
get
it
there
were
people
around
and
they
wanted
me
to
beg
when
they
said
the
ship
was
going
to
sail
i
got
aboard
and
hid
on
the
lower
deck
two
days
after
that
i
thought
the
ship
was
going
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
i
did
care
very
much
for
i
had
been
vomiting
and
it
seemed
as
if
my
heart
was
breaking
and
i
was
sick
so
sick
that
i
did
care
whether
i
was
dead
or
alive
one
of
the
sailors
heard
me
groaning
and
pulled
me
out
by
the
leg
then
he
looked
at
me
and
swore
caught
me
by
the
neck
and
dragged
me
before
the
captain
i
was
so
sick
i
could
not
stand
but
the
captain
was
not
angry
he
was
very
funny
for
he
laughed
very
loudly
and
said
the
kid
to
work
and
if
he
does
do
it
put
a
hose
on
him
four
of
us
altogether
had
stowed
away
on
that
ship
the
other
boys
laughed
a
good
deal
at
me
because
i
got
the
easiest
job
of
them
all
when
i
was
able
to
stand
on
my
feet
they
made
me
clean
a
little
brass
cannon
i
could
clean
it
sitting
down
and
i
liked
the
job
when
i
was
not
sick
every
one
was
good
to
me
and
i
had
a
happy
time
the
last
few
days
of
the
voyage
then
i
came
to
new
york
and
met
you
this
in
briefest
outline
is
the
story
of
johnnie
walker
i
met
him
at
a
mission
on
the
edge
of
the
north
river
and
was
as
touched
by
his
story
as
others
had
been
before
me
so
i
took
him
to
my
home
introduced
him
to
the
bathroom
and
to
a
new
suit
of
clothes
and
johnnie
entered
upon
the
happiest
days
of
his
life
after
a
few
weeks
i
handed
him
over
to
the
children
aid
society
and
they
sent
him
out
west
he
has
always
called
me
father
one
evening
i
asked
him
what
he
knew
about
jesus
and
he
replied
ai
th
bloke
as
they
swears
about
his
ideas
of
prayer
were
also
dim
but
he
made
an
attempt
he
wrote
a
letter
to
god
and
read
it
on
his
knees
before
going
to
bed
he
is
now
a
prosperous
farmer
in
the
far
west
living
on
a
quarter
section
of
land
given
to
him
by
the
government
and
on
which
he
has
made
good
his
claim
to
american
citizenship
chapter
x
i
meet
some
outcasts
a
sharp
contrast
to
this
waif
of
the
street
is
the
case
of
a
statesman
under
a
cloud
i
was
sitting
on
a
bench
near
the
one
day
at
twilight
when
i
noticed
a
profile
silhouetted
against
the
window
i
had
seen
only
one
profile
like
that
in
my
life
and
that
was
when
i
was
a
boy
i
moved
closer
the
man
sat
like
a
statue
his
face
was
very
pale
and
he
was
gazing
vacantly
at
the
walls
in
the
rear
of
the
building
finally
i
went
over
and
sat
down
beside
him
good
evening
he
said
quietly
in
answer
to
my
salutation
i
looked
into
his
face
a
face
i
knew
when
a
boy
a
face
familiar
to
the
of
victoria
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
i
called
him
by
name
at
the
sound
of
his
own
name
his
paleness
turned
to
an
ashy
yellow
in
heaven
name
i
said
what
are
you
doing
here
he
looked
at
me
with
an
expression
of
excruciating
pain
on
his
face
and
said
i
have
travelled
some
thousands
of
miles
in
order
to
be
alone
if
you
have
any
kindness
any
pity
leave
me
pardon
me
i
said
for
intruding
that
night
the
invited
him
to
take
part
in
their
deliberations
he
refused
and
his
manner
showed
that
he
considered
the
invitation
an
insult
i
had
known
this
man
as
a
brilliant
orator
a
religious
leader
the
champion
of
a
sect
in
a
city
across
the
sea
i
had
sat
as
a
barelegged
boy
on
an
upturned
barrel
part
of
an
immense
crowd
listening
to
the
flow
of
his
oratory
next
day
he
left
the
some
weeks
afterward
i
found
him
on
a
curbstone
preaching
to
whoever
of
the
pedestrians
would
listen
at
the
close
of
his
address
i
introduced
myself
again
he
took
me
to
his
new
lodging
and
i
put
the
questions
that
filled
my
mind
for
answer
he
gave
me
the
house
of
commons
blue
book
which
explained
the
charge
hanging
over
him
almost
daily
for
weeks
i
heard
him
on
his
knees
proclaim
his
innocence
of
the
unmentionable
crime
with
which
he
was
charged
after
some
weeks
of
daily
association
he
said
to
me
i
believe
you
are
sent
of
god
to
guide
me
and
i
am
prepared
to
take
your
advice
my
advice
was
ready
he
turned
pale
as
i
told
him
to
pack
his
trunk
and
take
the
next
ship
for
england
face
the
storm
like
a
man
i
urged
and
he
said
it
will
kill
me
but
i
will
do
it
he
did
it
and
it
swept
him
to
prison
to
shame
and
to
oblivion
nothing
in
the
life
of
the
was
more
noticeable
than
the
way
men
of
intelligence
grouped
themselves
together
besides
the
judge
there
were
an
an
of
victoria
and
a
german
graf
i
named
them
the
every
morning
they
separated
as
though
forever
every
night
they
returned
and
looked
at
one
another
in
surprise
at
both
political
parties
had
access
to
the
register
and
every
lodger
was
the
recipient
of
two
letters
between
elections
a
letter
was
always
a
matter
of
sensational
interest
it
lay
on
the
clerk
table
waiting
to
be
claimed
and
every
lodger
inspected
it
as
he
passed
scores
of
men
who
never
expected
a
letter
would
pick
it
up
handle
it
in
a
wistful
and
affectionate
manner
and
regretfully
lay
it
down
again
i
have
often
wished
i
could
analyze
the
thoughts
of
these
men
as
they
tenderly
handled
these
rare
visitors
conducted
by
uncle
sam
into
the
it
was
a
big
letter
with
red
seals
and
an
aristocratic
monogram
that
first
drew
attention
to
a
who
had
signed
himself
hans
schwanen
dutchy
had
whispered
to
some
of
his
friends
that
the
recipient
of
the
letter
was
a
real
german
graf
he
was
about
sixty
years
of
age
short
rotund
corpulent
his
head
was
and
set
well
down
on
his
shoulders
his
clothes
were
baggy
and
threadbare
his
linen
soiled
and
shabby
he
had
blue
eyes
harsh
red
hair
and
a
florid
complexion
when
he
arrived
he
brought
three
valises
everybody
wondered
what
he
could
have
in
them
the
bouncer
was
consumed
with
a
desire
to
examine
the
contents
and
as
bouncer
and
general
of
the
house
expected
that
they
would
naturally
be
placed
under
his
care
when
however
it
was
announced
that
the
newcomer
had
engaged
dutchy
as
his
valet
the
bouncer
swore
and
said
he
might
go
to
there
was
something
peculiar
and
mysterious
in
a
guest
of
the
bismarck
hiring
a
valet
the
germans
called
him
graf
von
habernichts
he
kept
aloof
from
the
crowd
he
had
no
friends
and
would
permit
no
one
to
establish
any
intercourse
with
him
his
valet
informed
an
intimate
friend
that
the
graf
received
a
check
from
germany
every
three
months
while
it
lasted
it
was
the
duty
to
order
pay
for
and
keep
a
record
of
all
food
and
refreshment
when
the
bouncer
told
me
of
these
things
i
tried
very
hard
to
persuade
the
graf
to
dine
at
my
house
but
he
declined
without
even
the
formality
of
thanks
after
a
few
months
the
revenue
of
the
mysterious
stranger
dried
up
and
dutchy
was
discharged
a
snowstorm
found
the
old
graf
with
an
attack
of
rheumatism
and
helpless
then
he
was
forced
to
relinquish
his
cot
and
move
upstairs
to
a
bunk
when
he
was
able
to
get
out
again
he
came
back
dragging
up
the
rickety
old
stairs
a
several
of
the
guests
offered
a
hand
but
he
spurned
them
all
and
stuck
to
his
job
until
he
got
it
up
another
snowstorm
brought
back
his
rheumatism
he
got
permission
to
sit
indoors
the
old
wheel
lay
idle
in
the
corner
he
was
hungry
and
his
pipe
had
been
empty
for
a
day
and
a
night
but
still
he
sat
bolt
upright
in
pain
alone
with
starvation
staring
him
in
the
face
the
third
day
of
his
voluntary
fast
he
got
a
letter
it
contained
a
bill
the
sender
was
watching
at
a
safe
distance
and
he
recorded
that
the
graf
puzzled
look
almost
developed
into
a
smile
he
gathered
himself
together
and
hobbled
out
to
a
nearby
german
saloon
next
day
came
the
first
sign
of
surrender
he
accepted
a
commission
to
take
a
census
of
the
house
this
at
last
helped
to
thaw
him
out
but
it
did
last
long
his
rheumatism
prevented
him
from
pushing
his
wheel
through
the
streets
and
i
secured
him
a
corner
in
a
locksmith
basement
he
had
not
been
there
many
weeks
when
he
disappeared
the
locksmith
told
a
story
which
seemed
incredible
he
said
the
old
graf
had
sold
his
wheel
and
given
the
proceeds
to
an
irishwoman
to
help
defray
the
funeral
expenses
of
her
child
some
months
later
the
clerk
of
the
got
a
postal
card
from
dutchy
he
was
on
the
island
and
the
graf
and
he
were
working
together
on
the
ash
gang
i
secured
his
release
from
the
island
when
he
returned
to
the
every
one
who
had
ever
seen
him
noted
a
marked
change
he
no
longer
lived
in
a
shell
he
had
become
a
human
and
took
an
interest
in
what
was
going
on
one
night
when
a
few
of
the
were
exchanging
reminiscences
he
was
prevailed
upon
to
tell
his
story
he
asked
us
to
keep
it
a
secret
for
ten
years
the
time
is
up
and
i
am
the
only
one
of
that
group
alive
in
it
was
my
brother
and
i
students
were
in
heidelberg
then
broke
out
the
revolution
two
years
less
of
age
was
i
so
to
him
was
due
my
father

most
of
the
estate

five
of
us
students

we
did
for

our
study

says
and
we
are
mad

said
the
people
are
many
and
they
are
oppressed
i
hate
my
brother
and
curse
him
till
in
our
room
he
weeps
for
sorrow
i
curse
him
until
he
leaves
by
and
by
in
the
barricades
he
finds
himself
fighting
against
the
king
in
the
fight
the
rebels
are
defeated
and
my
brother
escapes
many
are
condemned
and
shot
not
knowing
my
heart
my
mother
writes
me
that
my
brother
is
at
home
i
lie
in
my
bed
thinking
thinking
many
students
have
been
shot
for
treason
love
of
king
and
fatherland
and
desire
to
be
graf
are
two
thoughts
in
my
heart
i
inform
my
brother

arrested
and
in
fortress
is
he
put
to
be
shot
four
of
us
students
of
patriotism

see
my
heart
sinks
to
see
my
brother
so
white
is
he
and
fearless
his
eyes
are
bright
like
fire
and
he
stands
so
cool
and
straight
have
nothing
but
love
he
says

the
cause
of
truth
and
justice
to
kill
me
is
not
to
kill
the
truth
where
you
spill
my
blood
will
revolution
grow
as
flowers
grow
by
water
i
forgive
then
he
sees
me
he
says
he
holds
out
his
arms
want
to
kiss
my
brother
he
says
the
general
he
says
right
but
i
love
the
king
i
have
no
brother
i
will
not
a
traitor
kiss
my
gott
how
my
brother
looks

so
full
of
sorrow
is
he
a
sharp
crack
of
guns
they
chill
my
heart
and
down
dead
falls
my
brother
i
go
away
outside
glad
but
in
my
heart
i
feel
burn
the
fires
of
hell
father
and
mother
in
one
year
die
for
sorrow
then
i
am
graf
i
desire
to
be
of
society

cold
guests
do
not
come
to
my
table
servants
do
not
stay
they
tell
that
they
hear
my
mother
weep
for
sorrow
in
the
night
i
laugh
at
them
but
in
my
heart
i
know
them
true
peasants
in
the
village
hide
from
me
as
i
come
to
them
but
my
mind
is
worse
every
night
i
hear
the
crack
of
the
rifles
the
sound
of
the
volley
that
was
my
brother
death
soldiers
i
get
men
of
the
kind
to
stay
with
me
they
do
not
come
back
they
tell
that
they
hear
tramp
tramp
tramp
of
soldiers
feet
one
night
with
the
soldiers
i
take
much
wine
for
i
say
shall
be
drunk
and
not
hear
the
guns
at
night
we
drink
in
our
noble
hall
heavy
doors
are
chained
windows
barred
draperies
close
arranged
and
the
great
lamp
burns
dim
we
drink
we
sing
we
curse
god
und
das
gesindel
ourselves
we
say
gods
then
creeps
close
the
hour
for
the
guns
my
tongue
is
fast
and
can
not
move
my
brow
is
wet
and
frozen
is
my
blood
boom
go
the
guns
then
thunder
shakes
the
castle
lightning
flashes
through
the
draperies
and
i
fall
as
dead
was
i
in
a
dream
i
know
not
i
did
not
believe
in
god
i
did
not
believe
in
heaven
or
in
hell
yet
do
i
see
my
past
life
go
past
me
in
pictures
pictures
of
light
in
frames
of
fire
two
boys
first
max
my
brother
and
i
playing
as
children
then
my
mother
weeping
for
great
sorrow
then
the
black
walls
of
the
great
fortress
my
brother
with
arms
outstretched
again
my
blood
is
frozen
again
creeps
my
skin
and
i
hear
the
volley
and
see
him
fall
to
death
i
fear
i
scream
loud
that
i
love
the
king
but
in
my
ear
comes
a
voice
like
iron
a
little
girl
then
with
hair
so
golden
comes
and
wipes
the
stain
of
blood
from
my
brow
i
see
her
plain
then
i
awake
i
am
alone
the
light
is
out
blood
is
on
my
face
i
am
paralyzed
with
fear
so
i
can
not
stand
when
i
can
walk
i
leave
for
i
think
maybe
that
only
in
germany

twenty
years

live
in
spain

i
hear

hour

my
blood

hear
the
death
volley

come
to
america
which
i
have
hated
yet
never
a
night
is
missed
it
is
at
the
same
hour
what

one
thing
in
the
world

where

i
sit
me
down
in
a
dark
alley
strange
is
my
heart
and
new

time
for

in
heaven
the
guns
are
silent
one
day
a
big
letter
with
several
patches
of
red
and
an
aristocratic
monogram
arrived
at
the
nearly
two
hundred
men
handled
it
and
stood
around
until
the
graf
arrived
every
one
felt
a
personal
interest
in
the
contents
it
was
dutchy
who
handed
it
to
the
owner
and
stood
there
watching
out
of
his
single
eye
the
face
of
his
former
master
the
old
man
smiled
as
he
folded
the
letter
and
put
it
into
his
pocket
saying
as
he
did
so
by
next
ship
i
leave
for
hamburg
to
take
life
up
where
i
laid
it
down
the
only
man
now
living
of
those
days
is
thomas
callahan
he
has
been
attached
for
many
years
to
yale
university
and
doing
the
work
of
a
janitor
many
yale
men
will
never
forget
how
doc
cared
for
dwight
hall
he
is
now
in
charge
of
yale
hall
the
circumstances
under
which
i
met
doc
were
rather
peculiar
say
bub
said
gar
the
bouncer
to
me
one
day
what
ungodly
hour
of
the
mornin
d
git
up
at
the
godly
hour
of
necessity
i
replied
wal
i
hev
a
pal
i
want
ter
interjooce
to
ye
at
six
i
met
the
bouncer
and
his
pal
at
the
corner
of
broome
street
and
the
bowery
next
morning
at
the
appointed
hour
dat
doc
said
gar
as
he
laid
his
hand
on
his
friend
shoulder
his
friend
bowed
low
and
in
faultless
english
said
i
am
more
than
pleased
to
meet
you
i
can
give
you
a
pointer
on
doc
the
big
fellow
continued
if
ye
tuk
a
peaner
to
th
top
av
a
mountain

let
her
go
down
the
side
sorter

apart
yes
sir
that
no
song
an
dance
an
play
any
chune
iver
invented
on
it
doc
laughed
and
made
some
explanations
they
had
a
wheezy
old
organ
in
halloran
dive
and
doc
kept
it
in
repair
and
played
occasionally
for
them
doc
had
a
rip
van
winkle
look
his
hair
hung
down
his
back
and
his
clothes
were
threadbare
and
green
with
age
his
shoes
were
tied
to
his
feet
with
wire
and
stockings
he
had
none
doc
had
studied
in
a
medical
college
until
the
eve
of
his
graduation
then
he
slipped
a
cog
and
went
down
down
down
until
he
landed
at
halloran
dive
for
twelve
years
he
had
been
selling
penny
on
the
streets
and
in
saloons
he
was
usually
in
rags
but
a
score
of
the
wildest
inhabitants
of
that
dive
told
me
that
doc
was
their
good
angel
he
could
play
the
songs
of
their
childhood
he
was
kind
and
gentle
and
men
could
be
vulgar
in
his
presence
i
saw
in
doc
an
unusual
man
and
was
able
to
persuade
him
to
go
home
with
me
in
a
week
he
was
a
new
man
clothed
and
in
his
right
mind
he
became
librarian
of
a
big
church
library
and
our
volunteer
organist
at
all
the
sunday
meetings
after
two
years
of
uninterrupted
service
as
librarian
during
which
time
doc
had
been
of
great
service
in
the
i
lost
him
five
years
later
crossing
brooklyn
bridge
on
a
car
i
passed
doc
who
was
walking
in
the
same
direction
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
i
planted
myself
in
front
of
him
doc
i
said
you
will
never
get
away
from
me
again
i
took
him
to
new
haven
where
he
has
been
ever
since
it
is
needless
to
say
that
several
years
work
in
the
midst
of
such
surroundings
gives
one
a
hopeless
outlook
for
that
kind
of
work
in
a
movement
to
establish
a
municipal
lodging
house
was
organized
and
i
became
part
of
it
a
committee
composed
largely
of
business
men
met
in
the
office
of
killaen
van
ransellaer
wall
street
in
discussing
the
plan
of
a
municipal
lodging
house
the
wayfarers
lodge
in
boston
an
institution
of
the
character
under
discussion
was
pointed
out
as
a
model
and
it
was
decided
to
send
a
representative
to
boston
to
investigate
and
make
a
report
on
it
i
was
suspicious
of
the
printed
report
of
the
boston
place
it
spoke
of
the
men
getting
clean
bedding
clean
sheets
and
good
meals
and
experience
was
teaching
me
that
that
kind
of
catering
for
the
tramp
would
swamp
any
institution
then
i
knew
something
about
the
padding
of
charitable
reports
i
did
not
care
to
offer
any
objection
to
the
sending
of
a
representative
but
i
determined
to
go
myself
so
dressed
in
an
old
cotton
shirt
with
collar
attached
a
ragged
coat
a
battered
hat
and
with
exactly
the
railroad
fare
in
my
pocket
i
went
to
boston
i
stopped
a
policeman
on
the
street
told
him
i
was
homeless
and
hungry
go
to
the
police
station
he
said
and
knowing
that
at
each
police
station
tickets
of
admission
were
served
i
presented
myself
to
the
sergeant
at
the
desk
furnished
with
a
ticket
i
went
to
no
hawkins
street
and
there
fell
in
line
with
a
crowd
of
the
same
kind
of
people
i
was
working
with
and
for
on
the
bowery
we
had
about
an
hour
to
wait
when
it
came
my
turn
for
examination
i
was
rather
disturbed
to
find
the
representative
of
the
committee
sitting
beside
the
superintendent
investigating
the
tramps
as
they
passed
i
knew
he
could
not
recognize
me
by
my
clothes
but
i
was
not
so
certain
about
my
voice
so
i
spoke
in
a
low
tone
open
your
mouth
the
superintendent
said
where
are
you
from
i
kept
my
eyes
on
the
ground
and
answered
a
little
louder
ireland
you
are
lying
the
superintendent
said
where
are
you
from
ireland
i
answered
again
in
the
same
tone
two
kinds
of
checks
lay
on
the
table
in
front
of
him
one
pile
green
the
other
red
after
answering
the
rest
of
the
questions
i
was
given
a
red
check
and
taken
to
a
cell
where
a
black
man
stripped
me
to
the
skin
why
did
i
get
a
red
card
while
most
of
the
others
got
a
green
card
i
asked
you
lousy
boss
dat
why
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
steam
so
he
tied
my
clothes
in
a
bundle
and
put
them
under
a
pressure
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
of
steam
the
coloured
man
remarking
as
he
stowed
them
away
what
left
of
when
they
come
out
boss
aint
gwine
to
do
no
harm
then
i
was
marched
sockless
with
my
shoes
on
and
a
metal
check
strung
around
my
neck
to
the
bath
where
i
was
taken
charge
of
by
another
coloured
man
here
he
said
as
he
pointed
to
an
empty
tub
i
bathed
myself
to
his
satisfaction
and
then
looked
for
the
clean
towels
of
the
annual
report
but
found
them
not
instead
there
was
a
pile
of
towels
already
used
towels
made
of
crash
and
i
was
told
to
select
the
driest
of
them
and
dry
myself
i
was
clean
when
i
went
into
that
tub
i
said
to
the
black
man
i
am
cleaner
now
but
if
i
dry
myself
with
this
sodden
piece
of
crash
i
will
be
dirtier
than
when
i
began
the
black
man
proceeded
to
force
me
to
do
this
and
his
attempt
nearly
ended
the
experiment
for
i
refused
pointblank
to
do
it
no
thank
you
i
said
i
will
walk
up
and
down
until
i
dry
when
the
superintendent
of
that
department
was
called
into
counsel
my
use
of
english
rather
surprised
him
and
he
let
it
go
at
that
then
we
were
marched
upstairs
to
bed
there
were
one
hundred
and
fifty
beds
in
a
big
dormitory
i
looked
around
for
the
linen
of
the
annual
report
and
was
again
disappointed
the
cots
were
furnished
with
horse
blankets
the
method
of
arousing
the
men
in
the
early
morning
was
rather
unique
a
man
with
a
stick
a
heavy
stick
that
reminded
me
of
an
irish
flail
thumped
the
bare
floor
and
to
my
astonishment
there
was
a
rush
of
this
naked
crowd
to
the
door
as
i
knew
no
reason
for
the
excitement
i
took
my
time
i
followed
the
men
to
the
where
after
calling
out
my
number
i
got
the
bundle
corresponding
to
it
and
it
looked
like
a
crow
nest
everybody
around
me
was
hustling
to
get
his
clothes
on
boiled
or
unboiled
and
again
i
was
mystified
as
to
the
hurry
when
i
arrived
in
the
yard
i
discovered
the
reason
for
this
unusual
activity
of
my
parishioners
the
first
men
out
in
the
yard
had
a
cord
of
wood
each
to
saw
and
it
took
twice
as
long
to
chop
as
it
did
to
saw
it
those
who
were
last
had
to
chop
i
took
my
axe
and
began
my
task
soon
the
splinters
were
flying
in
all
directions
the
man
next
to
me
was
rather
put
out
by
this
activity
and
said
that
if
he
wanted
to
work
like
that
he
could
do
it
outside
this
ai
no
place
to
work
like
that
he
said
then
he
began
to
expectorate
over
my
block
and
annoy
me
in
that
way
i
tried
a
few
words
of
gentle
persuasion
on
him
but
it
made
him
worse
he
bespattered
my
hands
and
the
axe
handle
and
i
took
him
by
the
neck
and
ran
him
to
the
other
end
of
the
yard
and
dumped
him
in
a
corner
any
kind
of
a
fuss
in
that
yard
had
usually
a
very
serious
ending
but
this
had
not
for
the
yard
superintendent
took
my
part
i
think
it
was
about
eleven
in
the
forenoon
when
i
finished
my
wood
and
went
in
to
get
breakfast
which
consisted
of
a
bowl
of
gruel
and
two
hard
biscuits
one
of
these
biscuits
i
kept
hanging
in
my
study
for
two
years
after
breakfast
i
marched
into
the
office
and
said
to
the
superintendent
brother
i
want
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
which
belong
to
a
domain
that
mysterious
domain
that
lies
between
the
facts
and
your
report
are
you
a
reporter
was
his
first
question
assuring
him
that
i
was
not
i
asked
him
the
necessary
questions
and
furnished
with
some
real
information
i
returned
to
the
wall
street
conference
i
think
john
finley
of
the
city
college
was
the
representative
and
he
rendered
his
report
then
i
stood
up
and
told
of
my
experience
which
differed
vitally
from
the
of
the
annual
report
the
facts
as
i
found
them
were
all
in
favour
of
such
an
institution
a
man
would
have
to
be
mighty
hard
up
to
go
to
the
boston
municipal
lodging
house
and
that
is
exactly
what
was
needed
the
necessity
for
padding
the
annual
report
i
could
never
find
out
the
municipal
lodging
house
agitated
at
that
time
is
now
a
fact
it
has
been
duplicated
on
february
in
the
church
of
the
covenant
on
park
avenue
i
made
the
suggestion
and
it
was
published
in
the
papers
the
following
day
that
there
was
a
splendid
opportunity
for
a
philanthropist
to
invest
a
few
million
dollars
at
five
per
cent
in
a
few
lodging
houses
on
a
gigantic
scale
what
connection
the
mills
hotels
bear
to
that
suggestion
i
do
not
know
but
they
are
the
exact
fulfilment
of
it
a
few
years
in
that
work
gave
me
a
terrific
feeling
of
hopelessness
and
i
longed
for
some
other
form
of
church
work
where
i
could
obviate
some
of
the
work
of
the
bowery
the
best
a
man
could
do
on
the
bowery
was
to
save
a
few
old
stranded
wrecks
but
the
work
among
children
appealed
to
me
now
with
far
greater
force
i
also
saw
the
necessity
of
the
preacher
touching
not
only
the
spiritual
side
of
a
man
but
the
material
side
also
a
preacher
function
as
i
understood
it
after
these
experiences
was
to
touch
the
whole
round
sphere
of
life
chapter
xi
a
church
in
the
ghetto
about
this
time
the
old
church
of
sea
and
land
at
the
corner
of
market
and
henry
streets
was
to
be
put
up
for
auction
the
new
york
presbytery
wanted
to
sell
it
and
devote
most
of
the
money
to
the
building
up
of
uptown
churches
i
was
sent
there
by
the
missionary
society
to
hold
the
place
until
they
got
a
good
price
for
it
i
gathered
the
trustees
around
me
a
splendid
band
of
devout
men
mostly
young
men
and
i
did
not
need
to
tell
them
that
it
was
a
forlorn
hope
they
already
knew
it
we
outlined
a
plan
of
campaign
to
save
the
church
for
that
community
and
the
result
is
that
the
church
is
there
of
course
the
district
is
largely
jewish
but
there
were
enough
gentiles
to
fill
a
dozen
churches
it
was
inevitable
that
we
should
get
in
touch
with
the
jewish
children
we
had
a
kindergarten
but
made
it
known
to
the
jewish
community
that
we
were
not
in
the
business
of
proselyting
and
that
they
need
have
no
hesitation
in
sending
their
children
to
our
kindergarten
which
was
a
great
blessing
to
the
whole
community
sunday
evenings
in
the
spring
and
fall
i
spoke
to
large
congregations
of
jewish
people
from
the
steps
of
the
church
on
the
spirit
of
jewish
history
as
to
what
it
had
done
for
the
world
and
what
it
could
still
do
i
think
it
was
in
the
early
part
of
that
i
began
my
work
there
it
was
the
year
of
the
panic
and
the
east
side
was
in
a
general
state
of
stringency
and
starvation
a
group
of
ministers
of
various
denominations
got
together
and
devised
a
plan
for
a
cheap
restaurant
in
which
we
were
to
sell
meals
at
cost
probably
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
new
york
a
roman
catholic
priest
a
jewish
rabbi
presbyterian
methodist
and
baptist
pastors
sat
down
around
a
table
to
talk
over
the
welfare
of
the
people
a
committee
was
formed
and
i
nominated
the
catholic
priest
for
chairman
he
was
elected
the
restaurant
did
not
last
very
long
and
probably
the
chief
good
of
the
thing
was
the
getting
together
of
these
men
difficulties
of
course
came
thick
and
fast
kosher
meat
for
the
jews
fish
for
the
catholics
on
friday
and
any
old
thing
for
the
gentiles
were
the
smallest
of
the
difficulties
to
be
overcome
i
was
supported
in
my
church
work
by
a
band
of
young
men
and
women
mostly
from
a
distance
who
gave
their
services
freely
and
in
the
course
of
a
year
or
two
we
managed
to
increase
the
church
membership
by
a
hundred
or
so
and
occasionally
we
filled
the
structure
by
serving
out
refreshments
to
the
men
of
the
bowery
i
had
an
opportunity
to
touch
the
social
needs
of
the
community
by
coöperating
with
the
university
settlement
which
was
then
in
its
infancy
i
opened
the
church
edifice
for
their
lecture
course
which
included
henry
george
father
mcglyn
thaddeus
wakeman
daniel
de
leon
charles
spahr
and
sullivan
sixteen
years
ago
these
men
were
the
moving
spirits
in
their
respective
lines
in
new
york
city
the
new
york
presbytery
was
not
altogether
pleased
by
this
new
departure
in
church
work
but
we
had
the
lectures
first
and
asked
permission
afterward
most
of
these
men
filled
the
church
to
overflowing
in
the
case
of
father
mcglyn
hundreds
had
to
be
turned
away
as
i
sat
beside
father
mcglyn
in
the
pulpit
i
said
father
how
do
you
stand
with
the
pope
these
days
what
is
the
status
of
the
case
well
irvine
he
said
i
can
best
explain
it
by
a
dream
that
i
had
some
time
ago
i
dreamed
that
a
young
priest
visited
me
with
the
intention
of
getting
me
to
recant
he
said
you
recant
you
be
damned
and
i
thought
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
gave
the
only
answer
that
a
man
with
a
conscience
could
give
brother
i
be
damned
if
i
do
i
found
myself
drifting
quietly
out
of
old
methods
of
church
work
and
attempting
at
least
to
apply
religion
to
the
conditions
around
me
every
aspect
of
social
life
was
in
need
of
remedial
treatment
of
course
i
did
not
neglect
the
religious
teaching
but
what
the
situation
demanded
was
ethical
teaching
and
without
making
any
splurge
about
my
change
of
view
i
worked
at
whatever
my
hand
found
to
do
in
that
immediate
neighbourhood
illustration
alexander
irvine
from
a
sketch
by
juliet
thompson
the
men
and
were
terrorized
by
the
policemen
i
hired
an
one
summer
afternoon
to
play
for
several
hours
so
that
the
children
of
the
neighbourhood
might
have
a
dance
on
the
street
it
was
a
joy
to
my
soul
to
see
these
little
bits
of
humanity
dancing
by
the
hundreds
on
the
streets
and
sidewalks
most
of
them
barefooted
hatless
and
coatless
it
was
on
one
of
these
occasions
that
i
discovered
the
petty
graft
exercised
on
the
the
men
all
paid
toll
to
the
policeman
on
the
beat
and
the
captain
of
the
precinct
winked
at
it
the
officers
of
the
precinct
looked
upon
the
religious
leaders
as
easy
marks
every
one
of
them
the
detectives
of
the
society
for
prevention
of
crime
went
through
my
parish
and
discovered
wholesale
violations
of
excise
laws
and
city
ordinances
by
the
existence
of
and
the
selling
of
liquor
in
prohibited
hours
and
on
sundays
the
captain
of
the
precinct
came
out
with
a
public
statement
that
these
men
were
liars
that
the
law
was
observed
and
prostitution
did
not
exist
as
between
parkhurst
and
the
captain
of
the
precinct
the
public
was
inclined
to
believe
the
captain
one
sunday
evening
after
service
i
dressed
in
the
clothes
of
a
labourer
took
several
men
with
me
and
went
through
the
parish
the
first
place
we
entered
was
the
east
river
hotel
a
few
blocks
from
my
church
we
purchased
whiskey
at
the
bar
i
did
not
drink
the
whiskey
for
under
oath
i
could
not
tell
whether
it
was
whiskey
or
not
but
my
companions
were
not
so
hampered
after
paying
for
the
liquor
we
were
invited
upstairs
and
there
we
saw
one
of
the
ghastliest
most
inhuman
sights
that
can
be
found
anywhere
on
earth
outside
of
port
said
we
counted
forty
women
on
the
first
floor
we
saw
them
and
their
stalls
surroundings
and
companions
and
we
beat
a
hasty
retreat
a
cry
of
alarm
was
raised
and
the
barkeeper
jumped
to
the
door
it
was
secured
by
two
heavy
chains
no
explanation
was
made
but
a
straight
demand
that
he
open
the
door
which
was
done
and
we
passed
out
the
grand
jury
which
at
that
time
was
hearing
report
and
on
the
condition
of
the
neighbourhood
had
for
a
foreman
a
tammany
man
who
owned
several
saloons
we
went
into
these
saloons
one
after
another
purchased
liquor
in
bottles
and
next
morning
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
armed
with
affidavits
and
the
liquor
parkhurst
stood
at
the
door
of
the
jury
room
as
i
went
in
and
whispered
to
me
as
i
passed
him
this
thing
can
not
last
forever
the
first
few
minutes
of
my
testimony
i
was
unconsciously
assuming
the
position
of
a
criminal
myself
and
apologizing
for
interfering
with
these
gentlemen
the
assistant
district
attorney
instead
of
representing
the
people
and
standing
for
the
law
was
inquiring
into
my
reasons
for
doing
such
an
unusual
thing
i
objected
to
the
foreman
sitting
on
his
own
case
this
man
i
said
is
an
habitual
violator
of
the
law
i
am
here
to
testify
to
that
so
are
my
companions
we
have
the
evidence
of
his
here
and
i
pointed
to
the
bottles
that
we
had
placed
on
the
table
they
did
not
move
however
and
i
think
they
rather
considered
the
whole
thing
a
joke
we
proceeded
to
describe
the
east
river
hotel
and
similar
resorts
that
a
few
days
previously
had
been
described
as
immaculately
clean
by
the
captain
of
the
precinct
the
result
of
all
this
was
the
sustaining
of
the
testimony
of
detectives
the
petty
graft
among
the
and
the
men
went
right
on
complaints
were
jokes
and
were
treated
as
such
the
change
of
seasons
brought
little
change
in
the
activities
of
a
church
centre
like
that
in
the
winter
it
was
the
provision
of
coal
and
clothes
in
the
summer
it
was
parties
and
doctors
i
made
the
discovery
one
day
in
a
tenement
in
talking
to
a
little
child
of
five
that
she
had
never
seen
a
green
field
or
a
tree
this
led
me
to
ask
the
missionaries
assisting
the
church
to
make
a
search
for
a
few
weeks
and
collect
as
many
such
children
as
possible
we
got
together
seventeen
ranging
from
three
to
seven
years
of
age
not
any
of
whom
had
ever
seen
a
single
aspect
of
the
outdoor
world
save
the
world
of
stone
and
brick
and
wood
some
friends
in
montclair
arranged
a
lawn
party
for
these
little
ones
and
we
proceeded
nothing
extraordinary
happened
there
was
no
wonder
few
exclamations
as
we
intently
watched
the
emotions
of
these
children
as
they
gazed
for
the
first
time
on
lawns
flower
gardens
and
trees
of
them
were
seasick
on
the
train
and
the
one
regret
of
the
journey
was
that
we
had
not
taken
along
half
a
dozen
wet
nurses
the
one
unique
thing
of
the
day
was
the
luncheon
the
children
were
arranged
around
an
extemporized
table
where
sandwiches
lemonade
and
milk
were
abundantly
provided
at
a
signal
from
the
hostess
i
said
now
children
everything
is
ready
have
your
luncheon
but
there
was
no
commotion
of
them
sat
motionless
looking
at
each
other
the
sandwiches
were
made
of
ham
if
i
had
not
seen
this
with
my
own
eyes
i
would
scarcely
have
credited
the
telling
of
it
by
anybody
else
of
the
children
were
of
jewish
parents
and
had
been
taught
at
least
one
thing
thoroughly
the
hostess
did
the
best
she
could
under
the
circumstances
and
provided
other
kinds
of
meat
cake
and
fruit
and
the
festal
occasion
had
a
happy
ending
a
certain
amount
of
care
has
always
to
be
exercised
in
new
enterprises
in
departures
from
the
ordinary
routine
especially
if
they
involve
expense
or
as
i
have
said
before
interfere
with
political
or
economic
progress
pulpit
preaching
is
the
smallest
item
in
the
entire
programme
of
a
preacher
especially
in
such
a
neighbourhood
and
in
such
a
church
if
a
preacher
wants
an
audience
all
he
has
to
do
is
to
step
outside
his
church
door
stand
on
a
box
and
the
audience
is
it
is
miscellaneous
and
cosmopolitan
it
is
respectful
and
multitudinous
when
i
discovered
this
i
proceeded
to
act
on
my
convictions
and
copy
to
the
extent
of
getting
an
audience
at
least
the
socialist
propagandist
and
i
proceeded
to
work
the
people
around
me
instead
of
them
there
were
no
lines
of
demarkation
to
my
activity
i
touched
the
life
of
the
community
at
every
angle
sometimes
entering
as
a
fool
where
an
angel
would
fear
to
tread
i
was
called
upon
to
visit
a
poor
couple
who
lived
in
a
rear
tenement
they
were
of
the
unattached
had
no
ecclesiastical
connections
whatever
i
saw
that
the
old
man
who
lay
on
a
couch
was
dying
he
was
scarcely
able
to
speak
but
managed
to
express
a
desire
that
i
sing
to
him
so
as
there
was
no
one
present
but
his
wife
and
myself
to
hear
it
i
sang
this
inspired
the
old
man
to
sing
himself
he
coughed
violently
tried
to
clear
his
throat
pulled
himself
together
and
sang
after
me
a
line
of
jesus
lover
of
my
soul
this
was
very
touching
but
the
solemnity
was
severely
jarred
by
following
that
line
by
the
first
line
of
little
brown
jug
do
i
love
you
so
between
the
little
brown
jug
and
the
sacred
poetry
of
the
church
he
wound
up
dying
with
his
head
on
my
knee
there
was
an
insurance
of
thirty
dollars
on
his
life
i
informed
the
undertaker
and
did
what
i
could
to
comfort
the
old
woman
who
was
now
entirely
alone
in
the
world
one
of
the
missionaries
of
the
church
came
next
day
and
helped
to
make
arrangements
for
the
funeral
which
was
to
take
place
in
the
afternoon
they
had
not
been
long
in
that
alley
and
knew
nobody
in
it
and
when
i
arrived
to
conduct
the
funeral
service
at
three
in
the
afternoon
there
was
a
little
crowd
of
people
around
the
door
and
from
the
inside
came
agonized
yells
from
the
old
woman
i
opened
the
door
and
marched
in
i
found
the
undertaker
in
the
act
of
taking
the
body
out
of
the
casket
and
laying
it
on
the
lounge
in
the
corner
the
old
woman
was
on
her
knees
wringing
her
hands
and
begging
him
in
the
name
of
god
not
to
do
it
i
asked
for
an
explanation
and
rather
reluctantly
the
undertaker
told
me
proceeding
with
his
programme
as
he
explained
that
there
was
a
kink
in
the
insurance
well
i
said
we
can
fix
that
up
all
right
yes
he
said
you
can
fix
it
up
with
cash
but
we
are
not
in
the
undertaking
business
for
our
health
you
know
well
stop
for
a
moment
i
pleaded
and
let
us
talk
it
over
have
you
got
the
dough
he
asked
not
here
i
replied
but
i
am
the
pastor
of
that
church
up
there
on
the
corner
and
surely
we
are
good
enough
for
the
small
expense
of
this
funeral
by
this
time
he
had
the
lid
on
the
casket
and
was
proceeding
to
carry
it
out
the
old
woman
was
now
on
her
feet
and
almost
in
hysterics
i
was
mightily
moved
by
the
situation
and
asked
the
man
to
wait
but
he
jabbed
the
end
of
the
casket
under
my
arm
perhaps
accidentally
pushing
me
to
one
side
on
his
way
to
the
door
i
was
there
ahead
of
him
however
locked
the
door
and
put
the
key
in
my
pocket
now
will
you
wait
for
one
moment
till
we
talk
it
over
his
answer
was
a
volley
of
oaths
i
waited
until
he
subsided
and
then
i
said
i
will
be
responsible
for
this
financially
you
are
wringing
the
heart
blood
out
of
this
poor
old
woman
and
i
do
propose
to
stand
by
and
allow
it
i
raised
my
voice
and
continued
i
will
give
you
two
minutes
to
put
that
corpse
back
in
the
casket
and
arrange
it
for
burial
and
if
you
do
do
it
there
may
be
two
to
bury
instead
of
one
i
began
to
time
him
making
absolutely
no
answer
to
anything
he
said
i
quieted
the
old
woman
stood
very
close
to
her
and
put
my
hand
on
her
head
i
said
it
all
right
mary
everything
is
all
right
you
are
not
friendless
you
are
not
alone
the
two
minutes
were
up
i
took
off
my
coat
rolled
up
my
shirt
sleeves
and
advanced
toward
him
are
you
going
to
do
the
decent
thing
there
was
one
long
look
between
us
then
he
put
the
body
back
in
the
casket
arranged
it
for
burial
and
i
opened
the
door
and
the
crowd
came
in
not
however
before
i
had
put
my
coat
on
again
i
read
the
service
and
preached
the
sermon
and
the
undertaker
did
the
rest
some
months
afterward
i
was
at
work
in
my
study
in
the
tower
of
the
old
church
when
i
heard
a
loud
knocking
at
the
church
door
a
most
unusual
thing
i
came
down
and
found
that
undertaker
and
a
gentleman
and
lady
well
dressed
evidently
of
the
class
standing
at
the
door
here
is
a
couple
that
want
to
get
married
irvine
the
undertaker
said
they
came
into
the
study
and
were
married
and
i
shook
hands
with
the
three
and
they
went
off
next
day
i
went
to
the
undertaker
indeed
he
was
an
undertaker
helper
i
went
up
to
his
desk
and
laid
down
a
bill
of
the
marriage
fee
without
being
invited
i
pulled
a
chair
up
and
sat
down
beside
him
now
tell
me
brother
i
said
confidentially
why
did
you
bring
them
to
me
a
smile
overspread
his
features
well
he
said
it
was
like
this
you
remember
that
funeral
business
yes
well
i
figured
it
out
like
this
that
one
of
the
two
of
us
was
puttin
up
a
damned
big
bluff
but
i
had
the
heart
to
call
it
shake
chapter
xii
working
way
down
after
some
years
experience
in
missions
and
mission
churches
i
would
find
it
very
hard
if
i
were
a
workingman
living
in
a
tenement
not
to
be
antagonistic
to
them
for
in
large
measure
such
work
is
done
on
the
assumption
that
people
are
poor
and
degraded
through
laxity
in
morals
the
scheme
of
salvation
is
a
salvation
for
the
individual
social
salvation
is
out
of
the
question
social
conditions
can
not
be
touched
because
in
all
rotten
social
conditions
there
is
a
thin
red
line
which
always
leads
to
the
rich
man
or
woman
who
is
responsible
for
them
coming
in
contact
with
these
ugly
social
facts
continuously
led
me
to
this
belief
it
came
very
slowly
as
did
also
the
opinion
that
the
missionary
himself
or
the
pastor
be
he
as
wise
as
solomon
as
eloquent
as
demosthenes
as
virtuous
as
francis
has
no
social
standing
whatever
among
the
people
whose
alms
support
the
institutions
religious
and
philanthropic
of
which
these
men
are
the
executive
heads
the
fellowship
of
the
saints
is
a
pure
fiction
has
absolutely
no
foundation
in
fact
in
a
city
like
new
york
except
as
the
poor
saints
have
it
by
themselves
tim
grogan
jolted
me
into
a
new
political
economy
the
crowded
streets
of
the
east
side
on
a
summer
night
gave
me
a
new
theology
i
stood
one
night
in
august
on
the
tower
of
the
old
church
and
looked
down
upon
the
sweltering
mass
that
covered
the
roofs
fire
escapes
and
sidewalks
the
roofs
were
littered
with
naked
and
children
panting
for
breath
down
on
the
crowded
streets
thousands
of
little
children
darted
in
and
out
like
sparrows
escaping
as
if
by
miracle
the
vehicles
of
all
sorts
and
descriptions
crowded
lined
the
sidewalks
the
stoops
too
were
crowded
what
a
mass
of
humans
what
a
ganglia
of
living
wires
as
i
looked
on
this
vast
multitude
i
questioned
the
orthodox
theology
that
held
me
in
its
grip
most
of
these
people
belonged
to
another
race
and
i
stood
at
that
moment
firmly
rooted
in
the
belief
that
this
multitude
was
inevitably
doomed
let
me
put
it
frankly
even
though
it
seems
brutal
doomed
to
hell
i
am
unable
to
analyze
the
quick
currents
of
thought
that
went
through
my
mind
at
that
instant
i
can
not
explain
how
the
change
came
i
know
that
there
came
to
me
a
bigger
thought
than
any
i
had
ever
known
and
that
thought
so
thrilled
me
with
human
feeling
with
love
for
men
that
i
said
to
my
soul
soul
if
this
multitude
is
doomed
to
hell
be
brave
gird
up
your
loins
and
go
with
them
in
that
tenement
district
people
were
being
murdered
by
the
tens
of
thousands
by
tuberculosis
by
defective
plumbing
by
new
diseases
born
of
the
herding
of
men
and
women
like
cattle
i
made
some
feeble
attempt
to
investigate
to
ascertain
to
acquaint
myself
with
the
facts
and
my
investigation
led
me
to
this
result
a
result
that
the
lapse
of
years
has
not
altered
that
the
private
ownership
of
tenements
the
private
profits
in
housing
was
not
only
the
mother
of
the
great
white
plague
but
of
most
of
the
plagues
down
there
that
endanger
health
it
led
me
to
the
belief
also
that
the
struggle
for
bodily
health
the
struggle
to
survive
was
so
fierce
as
to
leave
little
time
for
soul
health
or
mental
health
it
was
a
source
of
continual
wonder
to
me
that
people
so
helpless
and
so
neglected
were
as
good
as
they
were
or
as
healthy
as
they
were
it
did
not
seem
reasonable
to
lay
the
blame
at
the
doors
of
the
owners
of
the
tenements
many
of
them
had
a
tenement
only
as
a
source
of
income
and
to
acquire
the
tenement
had
taken
long
years
of
savings
earnings
and
sacrifices
it
was
part
of
the
great
game
of
business
the
game
of
live
i
die
you
the
churches
and
synagogues
are
of
little
vital
importance
there
because
they
ignore
social
conditions
or
largely
ignore
them
and
there
is
a
reason
for
this
also
and
the
reason
is
that
they
are
supported
by
the
people
the
very
people
who
perpetuate
the
evils
against
which
prophet
priest
and
pastor
ought
to
cry
out
continually
the
protest
against
such
conditions
is
a
negligible
quantity
there
is
a
protest
an
outcry
but
it
is
related
neither
to
the
church
nor
to
the
synagogue
the
east
side
has
a
soul
but
it
is
not
an
ecclesiastical
soul
it
is
a
soul
that
is
alive
so
much
alive
to
the
interest
of
the
people
that
many
times
i
felt
ashamed
of
myself
when
i
listened
to
the
socialistic
orators
on
the
street
corners
and
in
the
east
side
halls
they
were
stirring
up
the
minds
of
the
people
they
were
not
merely
making
them
discontented
with
conditions
but
they
were
offering
a
programme
of
reconstruction
a
programme
that
included
a
trowel
as
well
as
a
sword
the
soul
of
the
east
side
expressed
itself
in
the
yiddish
press
daily
weekly
and
monthly
and
in
yiddish
literature
and
in
the
spoken
word
of
the
propagandist
whose
ideal
though
limited
in
literary
expression
made
him
a
flame
of
living
fire
it
was
this
soul
of
the
east
side
that
drove
me
against
my
will
to
study
the
relation
of
politics
to
the
condition
of
the
people
one
of
the
first
things
that
i
discovered
was
the
grip
that
tammany
had
on
the
people
every
saloon
keeper
was
a
power
in
the
community
men
of
any
force
of
character
whatever
who
were
willing
to
hold
their
hands
behind
their
backs
for
tammany
graft
were
singled
out
by
the
organization
for
some
moiety
of
honour
small
merchants
found
it
to
their
advantage
to
keep
on
the
right
side
of
the
saloon
keepers
and
the
tammany
leaders
i
remember
trying
to
express
this
thought
in
an
uptown
church
to
a
wealthy
congregation
and
i
remember
distinctly
also
that
i
was
rebuked
by
one
of
the
leading
lights
of
the
missionary
society
of
which
i
was
a
part
i
was
informed
that
my
business
was
to
save
souls
and
in
my
public
addresses
to
tell
how
i
saved
them
that
political
conditions
must
be
left
to
the
politicians
and
it
was
done
to
the
old
church
at
the
corner
of
market
and
henry
streets
came
dowling
he
followed
me
as
a
matter
of
fellowship
we
loved
each
other
and
came
also
dave
ranney
the
puddler
from
pittsburg
on
the
first
anniversary
of
dave
conversion
i
gathered
a
hundred
wastrels
of
the
bowery
together
and
gave
them
a
dinner
at
the
church
dave
of
course
was
the
guest
of
honour
when
my
guests
were
full
and
warm
they
became
reminiscent
and
i
urged
them
a
few
of
them
to
tell
us
their
stories
to
unfold
the
torn
manuscripts
of
their
lives
dave
told
his
first
boys
he
said
i
was
one
of
de
toughest
gazabos
what
ever
hung
aroun
de
square

of
the
church
after
he
had
been
there
for
a
while
and
comfortably
housed
in
the
janitor
quarters
in
the
basement
he
thought
it
a
propitious
time
to
be
reconciled
to
his
wife
so
we
arranged
to
have
mary
come
down
and
inspect
the
place
we
put
extra
work
into
the
cleaning
of
the
quarters
furnishing
it
with
some
sticks
of
furniture
reconciliations
were
getting
to
be
an
old
story
with
mary
and
dave
knew
he
was
going
to
have
difficulty
in
this
new
attempt
he
finally
persuaded
her
to
make
a
visit
to
the
church
when
he
was
ready
dave
in
a
most
apologetic
tone
said
there
is
just
one
thing
lacking
here
what
is
it
dave
a
white
tie
where
on
you
the
white
tie
as
ecclesiastical
appendage
i
had
avoided
i
despised
it
but
dave
assured
me
that
if
mary
came
down
to
look
the
church
over
she
would
be
more
interested
in
my
appearance
than
in
the
appearance
of
the
church
because
what
she
really
wanted
was
an
assurance
that
dave
was
on
the
square
and
if
he
could
introduce
her
to
a
real
minister
as
his
friend
it
would
enhance
his
chance
i
sent
dave
to
the
bowery
for
a
five
cent
white
string
tie
and
i
borrowed
a
prince
albert
coat
there
was
an
old
stovepipe
hat
in
the
church
sort
of
legacy
from
former
pastorates
and
it
was
trotted
out
carefully
brushed
and
put
on
the
study
table
then
mary
appeared
dave
had
instructed
me
to
put
up
a
tall
talk
so
i
put
up
the
tallest
possible
mary
inspected
the
church
the
quarters
and
the
minister
then
she
looked
at
dave
and
said
in
an
undertone
this
looks
on
the
level
you
bet
your
sweet
life
dave
said
so
mary
was
installed
as
the
lady
of
the
temple
at
henry
street
and
for
seven
years
ministered
to
the
poor
and
the
needy
and
kept
in
order
the
house
of
god
after
her
death
dave
remained
at
the
church
about
a
year
then
he
became
my
successor
as
missionary
to
the
lodging
houses
on
the
bowery
where
he
still
works
a
sort
of
humble
doctor
of
the
humanities
feeding
the
hungry
clothing
the
naked
comforting
men
in
despair
it
seemed
to
me
at
that
time
that
what
a
weak
church
like
that
most
needed
was
a
strong
powerful
church
to
put
its
arms
around
it
and
give
it
support
i
interviewed
parkhurst
as
i
was
chairman
of
a
committee
of
the
city
vigilance
league
which
he
organized
the
result
was
that
parkhurst
church
gave
it
for
a
year
support
and
absolute
independence
of
action
at
the
same
time
then
the
rev
john
hopkins
dennison
who
had
been
parkhurst
assistant
superseded
me
in
the
care
of
the
church
and
was
able
to
bring
to
its
support
help
that
i
could
not
have
touched
dennison
service
to
that
church
is
worthy
of
a
better
record
than
it
has
yet
received
he
performed
brilliant
service
intensified
the
life
of
the
church
and
gathered
around
it
a
band
of
noble
people
he
transformed
the
tower
of
the
church
into
a
kind
of
modern
monastery
in
which
he
lived
himself
and
in
which
dowling
the
old
irish
tinker
had
a
place
also
and
which
he
made
a
centre
of
ten
years
missionary
work
chiefly
among
the
lodging
houses
where
i
found
him
one
day
dowling
was
walking
along
the
bowery
when
a
hand
was
laid
roughly
on
his
shoulder
and
a
voice
said
ai
you
dowling
yes
what
did
you
do
with
the
loot
in
the
sepoy
rebellion
in
india
he
had
looted
the
palace
of
a
rajah
with
two
other
soldiers
the
most
valuable
items
of
the
booty
were
several
bamboo
canes
stuffed
with
diamonds
rubies
and
sapphires
in
the
act
of
burying
them
for
protection
and
hiding
one
of
the
soldiers
was
shot
dead
the
other
two
escaped
and
separated
and
all
these
years
each
of
them
had
lived
in
the
suspicion
that
the
other
had
gone
back
for
the
loot
and
they
both
discovered
on
the
bowery
that
neither
of
them
had
and
that
this
valuable
stuff
was
buried
in
india
dowling
wrote
to
the
and
told
of
his
part
in
the
affair
and
volunteered
to
come
out
and
locate
it
but
by
this
time
his
body
was
wasted
his
steps
were
tottering
and
his
head
bent
dollars
were
appropriated
by
the
indian
government
to
take
him
out
but
dowling
was
destined
for
another
journey
and
in
the
old
tower
that
he
loved
so
well
and
where
he
was
beloved
by
every
one
who
knew
him
he
lay
down
and
died
they
buried
him
in
plainfield
and
his
friends
put
over
him
a
stone
bearing
these
words
that
were
so
characteristic
of
his
life
he
went
about
doing
good
my
next
service
was
in
a
city
of
a
second
class
beyond
the
mississippi
river
i
had
been
invited
as
a
pulpit
supply
in
one
of
its
largest
churches
but
when
i
arrived
i
found
them
in
a
wrangle
over
the
pastor
who
had
just
left
and
by
whose
recommendation
i
was
to
fill
the
pulpit
i
arrived
in
the
city
on
a
sunday
morning
and
went
from
my
hotel
to
the
church
prepared
to
preach
i
stood
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
vestibule
and
what
i
heard
led
me
to
go
straight
out
again
never
to
return
my
first
impression
of
the
city
was
that
it
contained
more
vital
democracy
than
any
city
i
had
ever
been
in
it
takes
an
old
world
proletarian
a
long
time
to
outgrow
a
sense
of
subserviency
as
a
missionary
and
almoner
of
the
rich
in
new
york
this
sense
was
very
strong
in
me
in
the
west
i
felt
this
vital
democracy
so
keenly
and
saw
the
vision
of
political
independence
so
clearly
that
my
very
blood
seemed
to
change
politically
i
was
born
again
chapter
xiii
life
and
doubt
on
the
bottoms
while
studying
the
social
conditions
of
this
city
i
took
a
residence
on
the
banks
of
the
river
among
the
squatters
there
were
about
fifteen
hundred
people
living
in
shacks
on
this
no
man
land
my
residence
was
a
shack
for
which
i
paid
three
dollars
a
month
it
was
at
the
bottom
of
a
big
clay
bank
and
not
far
from
where
the
city
dumped
its
garbage
there
was
neither
church
nor
chapel
in
this
neglected
district
and
the
people
were
mostly
foreigners
but
the
children
all
spoke
english
during
the
early
part
of
my
stay
in
that
shack
i
entered
my
first
great
period
of
doubting
doubt
as
to
the
moral
order
of
the
universe
doubt
on
the
question
of
god
i
had
gone
through
some
great
soul
struggles
but
this
was
the
greatest
it
was
for
a
time
the
eclipse
of
my
soul
for
weeks
i
lived
behind
closed
doors
i
was
shut
in
with
my
soul
but
the
community
around
me
called
in
a
thousand
ways
for
help
for
guidance
for
instruction
and
i
opened
the
door
of
my
shack
and
invited
the
children
in
i
organized
a
sunday
school
and
taught
them
ethics
and
religion
i
got
up
little
entertainments
for
them
i
procured
a
stereopticon
gave
them
lectures
on
my
experience
in
egypt
and
lectures
on
art
biography
and
history
i
had
a
peculiar
method
of
advertising
these
lectures
i
informed
the
little
cripple
boy
on
the
corner
he
whispered
the
information
to
a
section
of
the
huts
at
the
farthest
end
of
which
a
courier
informed
another
section
so
that
by
the
time
the
lecture
was
scheduled
to
begin
my
audience
was
ready
and
most
of
them
slid
down
the
clay
bank
in
front
of
my
door
later
i
went
out
through
the
surrounding
towns
and
cities
lecturing
and
raised
money
for
a
chapel
and
we
called
it
the
chapel
of
the
carpenter
i
never
knew
the
meaning
of
the
incarnation
until
i
lived
on
the
bottoms
with
the
squatters
i
talked
of
great
characters
of
history
i
reviewed
great
books
i
travelled
with
these
children
over
the
great
highways
of
history
science
and
art
and
very
soon
we
had
a
strong
sunday
school
and
helpers
came
from
the
city
but
the
door
of
my
own
soul
was
still
shut
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
soul
was
dead
i
was
without
hope
for
myself
everything
around
me
was
dark
sometimes
i
locked
the
door
and
tried
to
pray
but
no
words
came
nor
thoughts
not
a
ray
of
light
penetrated
the
darkness
my
mind
and
intellect
became
duller
and
duller
it
was
at
this
time
that
i
came
across
the
writings
of
schopenhauer
and
schopenhauer
suggested
to
me
a
method
of
relief
i
may
be
doing
him
an
injustice
but
it
was
his
philosophy
that
made
me
reason
that
as
i
did
not
ask
to
come
into
life
and
had
no
option
i
had
a
right
to
go
out
of
it
there
was
nothing
spasmodic
in
the
development
of
my
thought
along
this
line
it
was
cold
calm
reasoning
i
had
determined
to
go
out
of
life
so
with
the
same
calm
deliberation
that
i
cooked
my
breakfast
i
destroyed
every
vestige
of
my
correspondence
and
one
night
went
to
the
river
to
seek
relief
i
was
sitting
on
the
end
of
a
log
when
a
man
who
had
been
working
twelve
hours
in
a
came
out
to
smoke
after
his
supper
he
had
not
washed
himself
his
bloody
shirt
stuck
to
his
skin
he
was
haggard
pale
and
we
dropped
naturally
into
conversation
in
language
intelligible
to
him
i
asked
him
what
life
meant
to
him
the
kids
he
said
that
what
it
means
to
me
i
work
like
one
of
the
things
i
kill
every
day
i
kill
hundreds
of
them
thousands
of
them
every
day
i
go
home
and
eat
like
one
of
them
and
sleep
like
one
of
them
and
go
back
to
hog
it
again
like
one
of
them
do
you
get
tired
tired
tired
as
hell
i
mean
tired
of
life
oh
no
he
said
i
aint
livin
the
best
kind
of
a
life
but
what
i
have
is
better
than
none
i
do
know
what
beyond
if
there
is
any
life
or
none
at
all
but
something
in
me
makes
me
stick
to
this
one
besides
if
there
is
any
chance
for
a
better
life
here
he
must
be
a
damned
coward
that
would
go
out
of
it
and
leave
it
undone
good
night
i
saw
him
retreat
to
his
shack
among
the
tall
weeds
i
heard
the
door
close
i
fancied
him
lie
down
in
a
heap
in
the
corner
and
go
to
sleep
he
was
a
better
philosopher
than
i
was
and
he
had
called
me
a
coward
but
he
had
not
altered
my
determination
i
began
to
sweat
it
was
like
the
action
of
a
fever
on
my
body
and
i
became
very
nervous
but
i
was
determined
to
meet
the
crisis
and
go
a
sudden
change
in
affairs
was
created
by
an
unearthly
scream
the
scream
of
a
woman
i
looked
around
suddenly
and
discovered
that
the
only
shack
on
the
bottoms
was
in
a
blaze
and
the
thought
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
be
of
some
help
and
accomplish
my
purpose
at
the
same
time
in
a
moment
i
was
beside
the
burning
hut
it
appeared
that
a
lamp
had
exploded
upstairs
and
that
three
small
children
were
hemmed
in
that
was
the
cause
of
the
scream
a
plank
that
reached
to
the
upstairs
window
was
lying
at
the
wood
pile
i
pushed
it
against
the
house
and
climbed
like
a
cat
into
the
burning
bedroom
by
this
time
the
neighbours
had
collected
and
i
helped
the
woman
and
lowered
the
three
children
down
one
by
one
and
then
deliberately
groped
for
the
stairs
to
get
hemmed
in
the
smoke
suffocating
me
as
i
did
so
by
the
time
i
found
the
stairs
my
hair
was
singed
my
arms
were
burned
but
i
was
gradually
losing
consciousness
and
before
i
reached
the
bottom
i
fell
suffocated
with
the
smoke
in
that
last
moment
of
consciousness
my
whole
life
came
up
in
review
i
had
no
regrets
i
had
played
a
part
and
it
was
over
when
i
came
out
of
coma
i
was
lying
on
my
cot
in
the
hut
the
neighbours
crowding
my
little
bedroom
and
standing
outside
in
scores
one
of
the
newspapers
that
had
most
severely
criticized
my
interference
in
politics
gave
me
a
pass
to
colorado
and
return
and
in
the
mountains
of
colorado
the
door
of
my
soul
opened
again
and
i
saw
the
world
beautiful
and
opportunities
that
were
golden
for
helpfulness
and
service
awaiting
my
touch
so
i
returned
to
my
hut
with
the
sense
of
god
more
fully
developed
in
me
than
it
had
ever
been
they
had
a
system
in
that
city
that
i
was
very
much
ashamed
of
that
i
thought
all
men
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
the
segregation
of
the
social
evil
i
discovered
that
the
city
fined
these
poor
creatures
of
the
streets
and
that
these
fines
amounting
to
thousands
of
dollars
every
year
went
straight
into
the
public
school
fund
so
that
it
could
truly
be
said
that
the
more
debauched
society
was
the
more
efficiently
it
could
educate
its
children
and
its
youth
these
houses
in
the
red
light
district
were
built
to
imitate
castles
on
the
rhine
and
were
owned
by
church
people
and
politicians
everybody
winked
at
this
condition
one
minister
of
this
town
uttered
a
loud
protest
and
took
his
children
out
of
the
public
schools
but
he
had
to
leave
the
city
the
christians
would
not
stand
for
such
a
protest
the
newspapers
would
not
touch
it
trustees
would
not
touch
it
the
great
political
parties
would
not
touch
it
i
joined
the
knights
of
labour
in
that
city
an
organization
then
in
its
prime
of
strength
but
they
would
not
touch
it
i
joined
the
people
party
in
the
hope
that
there
i
might
do
something
about
it
one
of
the
leading
members
of
that
party
importuned
me
to
nominate
him
as
presiding
officer
of
the
city
convention
on
one
condition
i
told
him
that
you
appoint
me
chairman
of
the
committee
on
resolutions
and
the
compact
was
made
five
men
were
on
that
committee
and
when
i
asked
the
committee
to
put
in
a
resolution
condemning
the
education
of
children
from
this
fund
they
refused
i
could
only
persuade
one
of
four
to
indorse
my
minority
report
which
signed
by
two
of
us
condemned
this
remnant
of
sodom
left
over
but
it
swept
the
convention
and
was
carried
almost
unanimously
even
the
three
men
on
the
resolutions
committee
who
refused
to
sign
it
before
voted
for
it
in
convention
i
am
aware
that
it
does
not
matter
from
what
fund
or
funds
the
public
school
system
is
supported
i
am
aware
also
that
one
of
the
things
we
can
do
is
to
make
that
kind
of
thing
cover
up
its
head
what
i
suffered
for
that
resolution
can
never
be
recorded
my
period
of
inclement
mental
weather
was
followed
by
a
period
of
poverty
destitution
rather
i
was
physically
unable
to
work
with
my
hands
and
i
had
not
yet
tried
to
earn
money
by
my
pen
i
was
often
so
reduced
by
hunger
that
i
could
scarcely
walk
at
such
times
one
feels
more
grateful
for
friendship
into
my
life
then
came
a
few
choice
souls
whose
fellowship
acted
as
a
dynamic
to
my
life
it
was
when
things
were
at
their
worst
that
george
herron
found
me
the
almost
jewish
cast
of
feature
the
strange
wonderful
voice
the
prophetic
atmosphere
of
the
man
forced
me
to
express
the
belief
that
i
had
never
met
a
human
being
who
seemed
to
me
so
like
christ
then
came
george
a
gates
the
president
of
iowa
college
where
herron
was
a
professor
about
the
same
time
came
elia
peattie
and
ida
doolittle
fleming
fleming
and
her
husband
helped
me
organize
a
congregational
church
which
when
organized
was
a
means
of
support
the
church
was
in
a
growing
section
of
the
city
but
i
could
not
be
persuaded
to
live
there
i
lived
where
i
thought
my
life
was
most
serviceable
on
the
bottoms
one
night
after
a
few
days
involuntary
fast
i
found
in
the
hut
two
cents
to
the
city
i
went
and
bought
two
bananas
one
i
ate
on
the
way
back
and
the
other
i
put
in
my
hip
pocket
there
were
no
streets
no
lights
no
sidewalks
in
that
region
as
i
came
to
a
railroad
arch
on
the
edge
of
the
squatter
community
i
saw
a
figure
emerge
from
the
deep
shadows
i
knew
instantly
i
was
to
be
held
up
but
as
life
was
rather
cheap
down
there
i
was
not
sure
what
would
accompany
the
assault
a
second
figure
emerged
and
when
i
came
to
within
a
few
yards
of
them
i
whipped
the
banana
from
my
pocket
and
pointing
it
as
one
would
a
revolver
i
said
move
a
muscle
either
of
you
and
i
blow
your
brains
out
gee
one
of
them
muttered
it
mr
irvine
they
belonged
to
a
gang
of
young
toughs
who
lived
in
a
on
the
banks
of
the
river
some
of
them
had
brothers
in
my
school
there
were
about
a
dozen
of
them
they
had
hinted
several
times
that
they
would
clean
me
out
when
they
had
time
but
they
had
delayed
their
plan
i
took
these
fellows
to
my
hut
and
we
talked
for
hours
when
i
produced
the
banana
they
laughed
vociferously
and
invited
me
to
their
hole
next
evening
they
gave
a
reception
and
i
suppose
fed
me
on
stolen
property
they
had
a
stove
a
few
old
mattresses
and
some
boxes
i
held
their
attention
that
night
for
four
hours
while
i
told
the
story
of
jean
valjean
next
day
we
were
all
photographed
together
on
a
pile
of
stones
near
the
hole
after
that
these
fellows
protected
the
chapel
and
made
themselves
useful
in
their
way
in
less
than
a
year
afterward
half
of
them
had
gone
to
honest
work
the
rest
went
the
way
of
the
transgressor
to
the
penetentiary
and
the
reform
school
this
period
was
one
of
total
rejection
by
any
means
powerful
influences
were
at
work
to
render
my
labour
void
but
they
were
offset
for
a
time
by
the
finer
influences
of
life
i
gave
a
series
of
addresses
in
tabor
college
iowa
and
they
were
the
beginning
of
an
awakening
among
the
students
after
the
last
word
of
the
last
address
the
student
about
whom
the
president
and
faculty
were
most
concerned
walked
up
the
aisle
and
expressed
a
desire
to
lead
a
new
life
do
it
now
i
suggested
right
here
yes
right
where
you
stand
the
president
and
faculty
gathered
around
him
making
a
circle
he
stood
in
the
midst
alone
and
in
that
way
with
prayer
and
dedication
from
the
lips
of
the
young
man
and
his
friends
began
one
of
the
most
useful
lives
in
the
american
ministry
this
young
man
became
an
ascetic
i
gave
him
to
read
the
life
of
francis
of
assisi
and
he
went
to
the
extreme
in
emulation
he
divested
himself
of
collars
and
ties
and
on
graduating
read
his
thesis
for
his
bachelor
degree
collarless
and
tieless
i
was
in
new
haven
when
he
came
there
to
take
his
divinity
degree
in
yale
he
came
without
either
collar
or
tie
but
after
days
of
prayer
and
fasting
he
was
led
to
enter
the
university
as
others
entered
it
he
is
now
pastor
of
the
first
congregational
church
in
rockford
illinois
his
name
is
frank
sheldon
nine
men
have
gone
by
a
similar
route
into
the
ministry
but
sheldon
is
the
only
one
of
them
who
has
kept
touch
with
the
modern
demands
on
religious
leadership
birthdays
have
meant
nothing
whatever
to
me
but
i
made
my
an
occasion
for
a
party
on
the
bottoms
i
could
only
accommodate
seven
guests
two
were
favourite
boys
and
the
others
were
selected
because
of
their
great
need
the
hut
was
the
centre
of
a
mud
puddle
that
january
morning
i
got
a
long
plank
and
laid
it
from
my
doorstep
to
the
edge
of
the
clay
bank
i
took
precaution
not
to
announce
the
affair
even
to
the
guests
but
a
grocer
boy
who
had
been
sent
by
a
friend
with
some
oranges
lost
his
way
and
his
inquiry
after
me
created
such
a
sensation
that
when
he
found
me
he
was
accompanied
by
about
fifty
children
old
belgarde
my
nearest
neighbour
had
whispered
across
the
fence
to
her
neighbour
that
something
was
sure
to
happen
for
she
had
noticed
me
making
unusual
preparations
that
day
i
think
the
origin
of
the
party
idea
came
with
my
first
birthday
gift
i
mean
the
first
i
had
ever
received
it
was
a
copy
of
thomas
à
kempis
given
me
by
my
friend
the
reverend
gregory
powell
i
gave
it
later
to
a
man
who
was
to
die
by
judicial
process
in
the
county
jail
when
the
hour
arrived
a
crowd
of
two
hundred
youngsters
stood
in
the
mud
outside
on
the
top
of
the
clay
bank
stood
parents
crossing
themselves
and
praying
quietly
that
their
offspring
would
be
lucky
enough
to
get
in
i
had
taught
these
children
some
simple
rules
of
order
and
when
i
opened
the
door
i
rang
a
little
bell
there
was
absolute
silence
they
had
been
actually
tearing
each
other
clothing
to
rags
for
a
position
near
the
door
i
told
them
that
i
was
so
poor
that
i
had
scarcely
enough
food
for
myself
that
the
little
i
had
i
was
going
to
share
with
seven
of
my
special
friends
of
course
they
all
considered
themselves
included
in
that
characterization
dear
little
friends
i
said
i
never
had
a
birthday
party
before
and
now
you
are
going
to
spoil
this
one
up
to
this
time
the
crowd
did
know
who
the
guests
were
i
proceeded
to
call
the
names
as
those
called
made
a
move
there
was
a
violent
fight
for
the
door
some
of
them
i
had
to
drag
out
of
the
clutches
of
the
unsuccessful
only
six
of
the
seven
were
there
there
was
a
howl
from
a
hundred
throats
to
take
the
place
of
the
absent
one
no
i
said
sternly
he
come
all
right
a
roar
of
discontent
went
up
and
chaos
reigned
i
could
make
myself
heard
i
rang
the
bell
and
again
calmed
them
i
was
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
say
dear
little
folks
i
said
i
thought
you
loved
me
do
too
whined
a
dozen
voices
then
if
you
do
go
away
and
some
day
i
will
have
a
party
for
every
child
on
bottoms
that
quieted
the
youthful
mob
and
they
departed
that
is
the
majority
departed
some
stayed
and
bombarded
the
doors
and
windows
with
stones
there
were
few
stones
to
be
found
and
as
it
did
occur
to
them
to
use
the
same
stones
twice
they
used
mud
and
plastered
the
front
of
the
hut
with
it
this
form
of
expression
however
did
not
disturb
us
much
i
sent
three
of
my
guests
into
the
back
yard
to
wash
and
arrange
their
hair
they
returned
for
inspection
but
did
pass
the
hair
refusing
to
comply
on
such
short
notice
i
put
the
finishing
touches
on
each
of
their
toilets
and
we
sat
down
to
supper
the
oldest
boy
fritz
was
half
past
twelve
and
the
youngest
ano
had
just
struck
ten

and
to
swear

the
oldest

in
point
of
wits
i
had
a
claim
on
eddy
one
day

was
amusing
himself
by
jerking
a
cat
at
the
end
of
a
string
in
and
out
of
frau
belgarde
well
she
was
stealthily
approaching
him
with
a
piece
of
fence
rail
when
i
arrived
and
possibly
prevented
some
broken
bones
kaiser
was
nearly
twelve
he
too
had
been
in
a
reform
school
he
liked
it
and
would
have
been
glad

long
as
they
wanted
him
for
he
had
three
meals
a
day
and
he
had
never

such
luck

the
guests

birthday
party
when

little
to
cover
this
aggregation

as
to
the
character
of
those
invited

blessing

asked
of
course
by
the
host
and
repeated
by
the
guests
of
things

eat
there
was
enough
and
to
spare
after
dinner
each
one
was
to
contribute
something
to
the
entertainment

here

my
left

reason
he
said
that
what
m
father
says
dey
ai
got
notin
to
do
in
the
midst
of
this
social
quiz
a
loud
noise
was
heard
outside
bang
bang
bang
the
timbers
of
the
hut
shivered
the
guests
made
a
rush
to
the
back
door
i
was
there
first
and
found
franz
the
missing
guest
his
arms
smeared
with
blood
his
ragged
jacket
covered
with
hair
of
some
sort
and
in
his
hand
a
bloody
stiletto
he
rushed
past
me
into
the
hut

to
the
table
and
exclaimed

a

ye
d

for
a
birfday
present
see
the
skin
was
lying
in
a
bloody
heap
outside
the
back
door
i
arranged
franz
for
dinner
and
the
party
was
complete
i
told
some
stories
then
we
played
games
and
at
ten
they
went
home
the
moment
the
front
door
was
opened
about
forty
children
each
with
a
lighted
candle
in
hand
sang
a
verse
of
my
favourite
hymn
lead
kindly
light
they
knew
but
one
verse
but
that
they
sang
twice
it
was
a
weird
performance
and
moved
me
almost
to
tears
after
they
sang
they
came
down
the
clay
bank
and
shook
hands
wishing
me
all
sorts
of
things
two
nights
afterward
i
had
a
different
kind
of
a
party
a
bullet
came
crashing
through
the
boards
of
my
hut
about
midnight
rushing
to
the
door
i
saw
the
fire
flashes
of
other
shots
in
a
neighbour
garden
i
went
to
the
high
board
fence
and
saw
one
of
my
neighbours
a
german
emptying
a
revolver
at
his
wife
who
was
dodging
behind
a
tree
my
first
impulse
was
to
jump
the
fence
and
save
the
woman
but
the
man
being
evidently
might
have
turned
and
poured
into
me
what
was
intended
for
his
wife
and
the
first
law
of
nature
was
sufficiently
developed
in
me
to
let
her
have
what
belonged
to
her
i
tried
to
speak
but
my
tongue
stuck
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
i
was
positively
scared
the
old
fellow
walked
up
to
the
tree
letting
out
as
he
walked
a
volley
of
oaths
i
recovered
my
equilibrium
sprang
over
the
fence
crept
up
behind
and
jumped
on
him
knocking
him
down
and
instantly
disarming
him
i
went
inside
with
them
and
sat
between
them
until
they
seemed
to
have
forgotten
what
had
happened
then
i
put
them
to
bed
put
the
light
out
and
went
home
i
examined
the
revolver
and
found
it
empty
next
morning
i
went
back
and
told
the
old
man
that
i
would
volunteer
to
give
him
some
lessons
in
target
practice
and
that
the
reason
i
knocked
him
down
was
because
he
was
such
a
poor
shot
this
old
couple
became
my
staunchest
supporters
i
interested
the
students
of
tabor
college
in
the
people
of
that
community
and
before
i
built
the
chapel
of
the
carpenter
which
still
stands
there
i
organized
a
college
settlement
which
was
manned
by
students
the
small
church
the
chapel
on
the
bottoms
the
work
of
the
college
students
and
the
increasing
circle
of
converts
and
friends
made
the
work
attractive
to
me
but
i
had
entered
the
political
field
in
order
to
protest
against
and
possibly
remedy
something
civic
that
savoured
of
sodom
and
for
a
minister
that
was
an
unpardonable
sin
the
interests
determined
to
cripple
me
or
destroy
my
work
this
they
did
successfully
by
the
medium
of
a
subsidized
press
and
other
means
fair
and
foul
it
was
a
case
of
a
city
against
one
man
a
rich
city
against
a
poor
man
and
the
man
went
down
to
defeat
apparent
defeat
anyway
i
packed
my
belongings
and
left
as
i
crossed
the
bridge
which
spans
the
river
i
looked
on
the
little
squatter
colony
on
the
bottoms
and
as
my
career
there
passed
in
review
for
the
second
time
in
my
life
i
was
stricken
with
and
i
was
guilty
of
what
my
manhood
might
have
been
ashamed
of
tears
chapter
xiv
my
fight
in
new
haven
the
experiences
of
and
gave
me
a
distaste
really
a
disgust
with
public
life
i
felt
that
i
would
never
enter
a
large
city
again
i
sought
retirement
in
a
country
parish
this
was
secured
for
me
by
my
friend
the
president
of
tabor
college
the
rev
richard
cecil
hughes
it
was
in
a
small
town
in
iowa
avoca
in
pottawattomie
county
i
stayed
there
a
year
in
i
was
in
cleveland
ohio
in
charge
of
an
institution
called
the
friendly
inn
a
very
good
name
if
the
place
had
been
an
inn
or
friendly
my
inability
to
make
it
either
forced
me
to
leave
it
before
i
had
been
there
many
months
it
was
in
cleveland
that
i
first
joined
a
labour
union
i
was
a
member
of
what
was
called
a
federal
labour
union
and
was
elected
its
representative
to
the
central
body
of
the
union
movement
early
in
i
was
in
springfield
delivering
a
series
of
addresses
to
a
bible
school
there
my
funds
ran
out
and
not
being
in
receipt
of
any
remuneration
and
not
caring
to
make
my
condition
known
i
was
forced
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
to
become
a
candidate
for
a
church
there
were
two
vacant
pulpits
and
i
went
after
both
of
them
meantime
i
boarded
with
a
few
students
who
like
their
ancestors
had
plenty
of
nothing
but
gospel
they
lived
on
cents
a
week
living
was
largely
a
matter
of
scripture
texts
hope
and
imagination
i
used
to
breakfast
through
my
eyes
at
the
beautiful
lotus
pond
in
the
park
we
lunched
usually
on
soup
that
was
a
constant
reminder
of
the
soul
of
tomlinson
of
berkeley
square
quantitively
speaking
supper
was
the
biggest
meal
of
the
day
it
was
a
respite
also
for
our
imaginations
the
day
of
my
candidacy
arrived
i
was
prepared
to
play
that
most
despicable
of
all
ecclesiastical
tricks
making
an
impression
i
almost
memorized
the
scripture
reading
and
prepared
my
favourite
sermon
my
personal
appearance
never
had
been
so
well
attended
to
the
hour
arrived
the
little
souls
sat
back
in
their
seats
to
take
my
measure
it
was
their
innings
i
had
been
duly
looked
up
in
the
and
my
calibre
gauged
by
the
amount
of
money
paid
me
in
previous
pastorates
the
service
began
my
address
to
the
almighty
was
prepared
and
part
of
the
game
is
to
make
believe
that
it
is
purely
extemporaneous
every
move
intonation
and
gesture
is
noted
and
has
its
bearing
on
the
final
result
i
was
saying
to
the
ecclesiastical
jury
look
here
you
wake
up
i
the
thing
you
need
here
sermon
time
came
and
with
it
a
wave
of
disgust
that
swept
over
my
soul
good
friends
i
began
i
am
not
a
candidate
for
the
pastorate
here
i
was
a
few
minutes
ago
but
not
now
instead
of
doing
the
work
of
an
infinite
god
and
letting
him
take
care
of
the
result
i
have
been
trying
to
please
if
the
almighty
will
forgive
me
for
such
unfaith
such
meanness
i
swear
that
i
will
never
do
it
again
then
i
preached
this
brutal
plainness
created
a
sensation
and
several
tried
to
dissuade
me
but
i
had
made
up
my
mind
it
was
while
i
was
enjoying
the
blessings
of
poverty
in
springfield
that
i
was
called
to
new
haven
to
confer
with
the
directors
of
the
young
men
christian
association
about
their
department
of
religious
work
i
had
been
in
new
haven
before
in
i
addressed
the
students
of
yale
university
on
the
subject
of
city
mission
work
and
as
a
result
of
that
address
had
been
invited
to
make
some
investigations
and
outline
a
plan
for
city
mission
work
for
the
students
i
spent
ten
days
in
the
slum
region
there
making
a
report
and
recommendations
on
these
the
students
began
the
work
anew
i
was
asked
at
that
time
to
attach
myself
to
the
university
as
leader
and
instructor
in
city
missions
but
work
in
new
york
seemed
more
important
to
me
i
rode
my
bicycle
from
springfield
to
new
haven
for
that
interview
when
it
was
over
i
found
myself
on
the
street
with
a
wheel
and
sixty
cents
i
bought
a
hot
dog
a
sausage
in
a
bread
roll
ate
it
on
the
street
and
then
looked
around
for
a
lodging
is
it
possible
i
asked
a
policeman
to
get
a
clean
bed
for
a
night
in
this
town
for
fifty
cents
anything
possible
he
answered
but
he
directed
me
to
the
gem
hotel
where
i
was
shown
to
a
box
the
walls
of
which
spoke
of
the
battles
of
the
weary
travellers
who
had
preceded
me
i
protected
myself
as
best
i
could
until
the
dawn
when
i
started
for
springfield
a
disciple
for
a
day
of
the
fad
things
were
arranged
differently
at
the
next
interview
i
was
the
guest
of
the
leaders
in
that
work
and
was
engaged
as
religious
work
director
for
one
year
i
think
i
was
the
first
man
in
the
united
states
to
be
known
officially
by
that
title
the
board
of
directors
was
composed
of
men
efficient
to
an
extraordinary
degree
the
general
secretary
was
a
worker
of
great
energy
and
business
capacity
and
as
high
a
moral
type
as
the
highest
he
was
orthodox
in
theology
and
the
directors
were
orthodox
in
sociology
it
was
a
period
when
i
was
moving
away
from
both
standpoints
to
express
a
very
modern
opinion
in
theology
would
disturb
the
churches
the
moral
backers
of
the
institution
to
express
an
advanced
idea
in
sociology
would
alienate
the
rich
men
the
financial
backers
a
month
after
i
began
my
work
i
supplied
the
pulpit
of
a
church
in
the
new
haven
suburbs
called
the
second
congregational
church
of
fair
haven
the
chairman
of
the
pulpit
supply
committee
was
a
member
of
the
board
of
directors
of
the
gradually
i
drifted
away
from
the
association
toward
the
church
the
former
was
building
a
new
home
and
many
people
were
glad
of
an
excuse
not
to
give
anything
toward
its
erection
so
any
utterance
of
mine
that
seemed
out
of
the
common
was
held
up
to
the
solicitor
an
address
on
war
kept
the
telephone
ringing
for
days
it
was
as
if
christianity
had
never
been
heard
of
in
new
haven
labour
men
asked
that
the
address
be
printed
and
subscribed
money
that
it
might
be
done
but
an
appeal
to
the
teachings
of
jesus
on
the
question
of
war
was
lauded
by
the
sinners
and
frowned
upon
by
the
saints
with
the
general
secretary
i
never
had
an
unkind
word
though
a
man
of
boundless
energy
he
was
a
man
in
supreme
command
of
himself
we
knew
in
a
way
that
we
were
drifting
apart
and
acted
as
christians
toward
each
other
what
more
can
men
do
barnes
the
director
who
was
chairman
of
the
pulpit
supply
committee
of
the
church
kept
urging
me
to
give
my
whole
time
to
the
church
every
day
for
weeks
he
drove
his
old
white
horse
to
my
door
and
talked
it
over
i
refused
the
call
to
the
pastorate
but
divided
my
time
between
them
for
the
my
duties
were
to
conduct
mass
meetings
for
men
in
a
theatre
to
organize
the
bible
departments
and
teach
one
of
the

the
same
time
i
entered
the
divinity
school
of
yale
university
taking
studies
in
hebrew
new
testament
greek
and
archæology
a
little
experience
in
the
church
taught
me
that
intellectually
i
was
leaving
the
ordinary
type
of
church
at
a
much
quicker
pace
than
i
was
leaving
the
edward
everett
hale
told
a
friend
once
that
he
preached
to
the
south
church
on
sunday
morning
so
that
he
might
preach
to
the
world
the
rest
of
the
week
i
told
the
officers
of
the
church
frankly
that
i
was
not
the
kind
of
man
needed
for
their
parish
but
they
insisted
that
i
was
so
i
preached
for
them
on
sunday
that
i
might
preach
to
a
larger
parish
during
the
week
two
things
i
tried
to
do
well
for
the
church
conduct
an
evening
meeting
for
the
unchurched
which
simply
means
the
folk
unable
to
dress
well
and
pay
pew
rents
and
conduct
a
meeting
for
children
i
organized
a
committee
to
help
me
at
the
evening
meeting
the
only
qualification
for
membership
on
the
committee
was
utter
ignorance
of
church
work
the
very
good
people
of
the
community
called
this
meeting
a
show
well
it
was
i
asked
the
regular
members
to
stay
away
for
i
needed
their
space
and
their
corner
lots
with
cushioned
knee
stools
i
made
a
study
of
the
possibilities
of
the
stereopticon
barnes
gave
me
a
fine
outfit
i
got
the
choicest
slides
and
subjects
published
prayers
hymns
scripture
readings
and
illuminated
bits
of
choice
literature
were
projected
on
a
screen
i
trained
young
men
to
put
up
and
take
down
the
screen
noiselessly
artistically
and
with
the
utmost
neatness
and
dispatch
i
discovered
that
many
men
who
either
lacked
ambition
or
ability
to
wear
collars
came
to
that
meeting
and
they
sang
too
when
the
lights
were
low
when
in
full
view
of
each
other
they
were
as
as
clams
the
singing
became
a
special
feature
my
brethren
in
other
churches
considered
this
a
terrible
at
first
but
changed
their
minds
later
and
copied
the
thing
borrowing
the
best
of
my
good
slides
and
not
a
few
of
the
unique
ideas
accompanying
the
scheme
a
methodist
brother
across
the
river
said
confidentially
to
a
friend
that
he
was
going
to
launch
on
the
community
a
legitimate
sensation
a
boys
choir
my
plans
for
getting
the
poor
people
to
church
succeeded
such
a
thing
as
fraternizing
the
steady
goers
goers
by
habit
and
heredity
and
the
unsteady
goers
goers
by
the
need
of
the
soul
was
impossible
the
most
surprising
thing
in
these
evening
meetings
to
the
men
who
financed
the
church
was
the
fact
that
these
poor
people
paid
for
their
own
extras
that
goes
a
long
way
in
church
affairs
the
weekly
children
meeting
i
called
the
pleasant
hour
believing
that
the
most
important
work
of
the
church
is
the
teaching
of
the
children
it
was
my
custom
for
many
years
in
many
churches
to
personally
conduct
a
sunday
school
on
a
week
day
so
that
the
best
i
had
to
give
would
be
given
to
the
children
in
my
larger
work
for
the
city
two
ideas
governed
my
action
one
was
to
get
the
church
people
interested
in
civic
problems
and
the
other
was
to
solve
civic
problems
or
to
attempt
a
solution
whether
church
people
were
interested
in
them
or
not
i
organized
a
flower
mission
for
the
summer
months
we
called
it
a
flower
house
an
abandoned
hotel
was
cleaned
up
a
few
loads
of
sand
dumped
in
the
back
yard
as
a
sort
of
extemporized
seashore
where
little
children
might
play
flowers
were
solicited
and
distributed
to
the
folks
who
had
neither
taste
nor
room
for
flowers
we
did
some
teaching
too
and
gave
entertainments
a
played
on
certain
days
by
the
sand
pile
and
that
music
of
the
proletariat
never
fails
to
attract
a
crowd
the
flower
mission
developed
into
a
social
settlement
we
called
it
lowell
house
at
first
the
church
financed
it
then
it
got
tired
of
that
and
when
i
incorporated
the
settlement
work
in
my
church
reports
in
order
to
stimulate
support
the
settlement
workers
directors
rather
got
tired
of
the
church
and
went
into
a
spasm
over
it
lowell
house
is
accounted
a
successful
institution
of
the
city
now
it
is
doing
a
successful
church
work
among
the
poor
church
work
with
this
exception
that
its
head
worker
its
educated
sympathetic
priestess
lives
there
and
shares
her
little
artistic
centre
with
the
crowd
who
live
in
places
not
good
enough
for
domestic
animals
in
new
haven
public
baths
consisted
of
a
tub
in
the
basement
of
a
public
school
i
photographed
the
tub
and
projected
the
picture
on
a
screen
in
the
grand
opera
house
for
the
consideration
of
the
citizens
that
was
the
beginning
of
an
agitation
for
a
public
bath
house
an
agitation
that
was
pushed
until
the
dream
became
a
brick
structure
i
was
not
particularly
interested
in
the
bath
it
was
an
opportunity
to
get
people
to
work
for
something
this
side
of
heaven
to
emphasize
the
thought
that
men
were
as
much
worth
taking
care
of
as
horses
an
idea
that
has
not
yet
a
firm
grip
on
the
mind
of
the
bourgeoisie
the
bill
passed
the
aldermanic
and
councilmanic
chambers
was
signed
by
the
mayor
and
the
matter
of
building
put
into
the
hands
of
the
board
of
health
the
board
forgot
all
about
it
and
some
time
later
the
agitation
began
again
and
persisted
until
another
city
government
and
another
mayor
had
made
a
second
law
and
carried
it
into
effect
there
was
no
ecclesiastical
objection
to
my
participation
in
this
movement
it
was
a
small
thing
and
cost
little
chapter
xv
a
visit
home
my
father
had
been
begging
me
for
years
to
come
home
and
say
to
him
so
in
i
made
the
journey
i
had
been
in
the
old
home
long
before
the
alley
was
filled
with
neighbours
curious
to
have
a
look
at
ould
jamie
son
who
was
a
clargymaan
i
went
to
the
door
and
shook
hands
with
everybody
in
the
hope
that
after
a
while
they
would
go
away
and
leave
me
with
my
own
but
nobody
moved
they
stood
and
stared
for
several
hours
i
mind
ye
fine
when
ye
were
th
height
av
a
creepie
said
one
woman
who
was
astounded
that
i
could
call
her
by
name
aye
said
another
ye
were
i
fond
o
th
bible
an
no
wundther
yer
a
clargymaan
a
dozen
old
women
minded
as
many
different
things
of
my
childhood
i
finally
dismissed
them
with
this
phrase
as
i
dropped
easily
enough
into
the
vernacular
shure
we
invite
ye
all
t
tay
but
only
three
cups
in
the
house
my
sister
mary
and
her
four
children
lived
with
my
father
we
shut
the
door
when
the
neighbours
left
and
sat
down
to
tay
which
consisted
of
potatoes
and
buttermilk
mary
had
been
trying
to
improve
on
the
old
days
but
i
interposed
and
together
we
went
through
the
old
régime
father
took
the
pot
of
potatoes
to
the
old
tub
in
which
he
used
to
steep
the
leather
there
he
drained
them
then
put
them
on
the
fire
for
a
minute
to
allow
the
steam
to
escape
i
going
to
them
i
said
and
they
both
laughed
oh
heavens
do
he
said
shure
they
do
pirtas
in
america
i
not
in
america
now
i
answered
as
i
circled
as
much
of
the
little
bare
table
as
i
could
with
my
arms
to
keep
the
potatoes
from
rolling
off
he
dumped
them
in
a
heap
in
the
centre
they
rolled
up
against
my
arms
and
breast
and
i
pushed
them
back
mary
cleared
a
space
for
a
small
pile
of
salt
and
the
buttermilk
bowls
we
haave
a
blessin
by
a
rale
ministher
th
night
mary
said
oh
yis
that
thrue
enough
my
father
said
but
alec
minds
time
whin
it
was
blessin
enough
to
hev
th
murphies
do
ye
boy
after
tay
i
tacked
a
newspaper
over
the
lower
part
of
the
window
my
father
lit
the
candle
and
mary
put
a
few
turfs
on
the
fire
and
we
sat
as
we
used
to
sit
so
many
years
ago
my
father
was
so
deaf
that
i
had
to
shout
to
make
him
hear
and
nearly
everything
i
said
could
be
heard
by
the
neighbours
in
the
alley
many
of
whom
sat
around
the
door
to
hear
whatever
they
could
of
the
story
they
supposed
i
would
tell
of
the
magic
land
beyond
the
sea
i
unbarred
the
door
in
answer
to
a
loud
knock
it
was
a
most
polite
note
from
a
roman
catholic
schoolmaster
inviting
me
to
occupy
a
spare
room
in
his
house
half
an
hour
later
we
were
again
interrupted
by
another
visitor
an
old
friend
who
also
invited
me
to
occupy
his
spare
bed
it
was
evidently
disturbing
the
town
to
know
where
i
was
to
sleep
i
politely
refused
all
invitations
each
invitation
was
explained
to
my
father
shure
that
what
cracking
m
own
skull
he
said
where
th
divil
will
ye
sleep
anyway
at
all
at
all
then
they
listened
and
i
talked
talked
of
what
the
years
had
meant
to
me
the
old
man
sighed
often
and
occasionally
there
were
tears
in
eyes
and
there
were
times
when
the
past
surged
through
my
mind
with
such
vividness
that
i
could
only
look
vacantly
into
the
white
flame
of
the
peat
fire
once
after
a
long
silence
my
father
spoke
his
voice
trembled
oh
he
said
if
she
cud
just
have
weathered
through
till
this
day
aye
mary
said
but
how
do
ye
know
she
is
jist
around
here
somewhere
anyway
aye
the
old
man
said
as
he
nodded
his
head
deed
that
thrue
for
you
mary
she
may
he
took
his
black
cutty
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
gazed
at
me
for
a
moment
what
d
mind
best
about
her
i
mind
a
saying
she
had
that
has
gone
through
life
with
me
day
makes
its
own
throuble
no
not
that
something
better
she
used
to
say
so
often
nice
to
be
nice
aye
i
mind
that
he
said
then
i
continued
on
sundays
when
she
was
dressed
and
her
nice
tallied
cap
on
her
head
i
thought
she
was
the
purtiest
woman
i
ever
saw
maan
she
was
that
when
bed
time
came
i
took
a
small
from
my
suit
case
spread
it
on
the
hard
mud
floor
rolled
some
other
clothes
as
a
pillow
and
lay
down
to
rest
sleep
came
slowly
but
as
i
lay
i
was
not
alone
for
around
me
were
the
forms
and
faces
of
other
days
next
day
i
visited
the
scene
of
my
boyhood
vision
i
went
through
the
woods
where
i
had
my
first
full
meal
i
visited
the
old
church
but
the
good
rector
was
gathered
to
his
fathers
it
was
all
a
it
was
like
going
back
to
a
former
incarnation
along
the
road
on
my
way
home
i
discovered
the
most
intimate
friend
of
my
boyhood
the
boy
with
whom
i
had
gathered
faggots
played
shinney
and
gone
he
was
nappin
stones
he
did
not
recognize
my
voice
but
his
curiosity
was
large
enough
to
make
him
throw
down
his
hammer
take
off
the
glasses
that
protected
his
eyes
and
stare
at
me
maan
yer
changed
he
said
are
you
and
you
och
shure
i
th
same
ould
sixpence
except
that
you
older
there
was
a
look
of
disappointment
on
his
face
maan
he
said
ye
talk
like
quality
d
live
among
thim
i
explained
something
of
my
changed
life
i
told
of
my
work
and
what
i
had
tried
to
do
and
i
closed
with
an
account
of
the
vision
in
the
fields
not
far
from
where
we
sat
aye
he
would
say
occasionally
aye
it
quare
how
things
turn
out
when
i
ended
the
story
of
the
vision
he
said
ye
haave
forgot
how
t
tell
a
feery
story
ye
wor
i
good
at
that
bob
had
read
a
book
or
a
newspaper
in
all
those
years
he
got
his
news
from
the
men
who
stopped
at
his
stone
pile
to
light
their
pipes
what
he
did
get
there
he
got
at
the
cobbler
while
his
brogues
were
being
patched
or
at
the
barber
when
he
went
for
his
weekly
shave
we
talked
each
other
out
in
half
an
hour
a
wide
gulf
was
between
us
it
was
a
gulf
in
the
realm
of
mind
as
i
moved
away
toward
the
town
i
wondered
why
i
was
not
breaking
stones
on
the
roadside
and
i
muttered
bob
phrase
how
quare
it
became
so
difficult
to
talk
to
my
father
without
gathering
a
crowd
at
the
door
that
i
shortened
my
stay
and
took
him
to
belfast
where
we
could
spend
a
few
days
together
and
alone
we
had
our
meals
at
first
in
a
quiet
little
restaurant
on
a
side
street
he
had
never
been
in
a
restaurant
as
the
waiter
went
around
the
table
the
old
man
watched
him
with
curious
eyes
i
have
explained
that
my
father
never
swore
he
was
mightily
unfortunate
in
his
selection
of
phrases
and
when
irritated
by
the
attention
of
the
waiter
to
the
point
of
explosion
he
said
in
what
he
supposed
was
a
whisper
what
th
hell
is
he
around
us
like
an
indian
fur
i
explained
everybody
in
the
place
heard
the
explanation
they
also
heard
his
reply
send
him
blazes
he
takes
m
appetite
away
we
moved
into
the
house
of
a
friend
after
that
one
afternoon
i
took
him
for
a
walk
in
the
suburbs
of
the
city
he
rested
on
a
rustic
bench
on
the
lawn
of
a
beautiful
villa
while
i
made
a
call
years
ago
i
said
to
the
gentleman
of
the
house
i
had
a
great
inspiration
from
the
life
of
a
young
lady
who
lived
in
this
house
and
i
just
called
to
say
you
her
father
is
dead
he
said
i
am
her
uncle
then
he
told
me
of
the
career
of
the
city
girl
i
had
met
on
the
farm
and
whom
i
had
watched
entering
the
church
on
sundays
about
the
time
you
missed
her
at
church
he
said
she
was
married
to
a
rich
young
man
he
spent
his
fortune
in
liquor
and
finally
ended
his
life
she
began
to
drink
after
his
death
but
was
persuaded
to
leave
the
country
she
went
to
america
we
have
heard
from
her
for
a
long
time
the
following
sunday
i
told
my
father
we
were
going
to
church
not
me
he
said
oh
yes
i
coaxed
just
this
once
with
me
what
th
divil
the
use
whin
i
haave
a
praycher

i
am
to
be
the
preacher
at
the
church
och
but
that
a
horse
ov
another
colour
bedad
shure
thin
go
when
my
father
saw
me
in
a
geneva
gown
his
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
the
old
lady
who
found
the
place
in
the
book
for
him
was
the
young
lady
mother
her
uncle
had
ushered
him
into
her
pew
but
they
had
never
met
each
other
nor
did
the
old
lady
know
until
after
church
that
he
was
my
father
he
never
heard
a
word
of
the
sermon
but
as
we
emerged
from
the
church
into
the
street
he
put
his
arms
around
my
neck
and
kissing
me
said
och
boy
if
god
wud
only
take
me
now
i
be
happy
he
had
been
listening
with
his
eyes
and
what
he
saw
so
filled
him
with
joy
that
he
was
more
willing
to
leave
life
than
to
have
the
emotion
leave
him
though
he
was
very
feeble
i
took
him
to
scotland
with
me
to
visit
my
brothers
and
sisters
and
there
i
left
him
as
the
hour
of
farewell
drew
near
he
wanted
to
have
me
alone
all
to
himself
ye
could
stay
at
home
awhile
shure
i
be
goin
in
a
month
or
two
ah
that
impossible
father
he
hung
his
head

believe

know
her
whin
i
go
god
wud
shut
me
out
from
her
for
th
things
i
done
of
course
he
wo
he
wud
be
so
d
d
niggardly
wud
he
never
he
fondled
my
hands
as
if
i
were
a
child
the
hour
drew
nigher
he
had
so
many
questions
to
ask
but
the
inevitableness
of
the
situation
struck
him
dumb
we
were
on
the
platform
the
train
was
about
to
move
out
i
made
a
motion
he
gripped
me
tightly
whispering
in
my
ear
ask
god
onct
in
a
while
to
let
me
be
with
yer
mother
will
ye
boy
i
kissed
him
farewell
and
saw
him
no
more
i
went
on
to
france
my
objective
point
in
france
was
the
study
of
millet
and
his
work
i
wanted
to
interpret
him
to
working
people
in
new
haven
so
to
greville
on
la
hague
i
went
with
a
camera
greville
consists
of
a
church
and
a
dozen
houses
gruchy
is
half
a
mile
beyond
on
the
edge
of
the
sea
in
gruchy
millet
was
born
in
greville
he
first
came
into
contact
with
incentive
i
photographed
both
places
and
spent
a
night
and
a
day
with
polidor
the
old
who
was
the
painter
friend
surely
never
was
so
large
a
statue
erected
in
so
small
a
village
the
peasant
artist
sits
there
on
a
bank
of
mosses
looking
over
at
the
old
church
that
squats
on
the
hillside
in
cherbourg
i
found
more
traces
of
his
art
and
some
stories
of
his
life
there
that
would
be
out
of
place
here
i
found
four
portraits
painted
while
he
was
paying
court
to
his
first
wife
i
found
them
in
a
little
shoe
shop
in
a
in
possession
of
a
distant
relative
of
his
first
wife
from
cherbourg
i
went
to
barbizon
where
millet
spent
the
latter
part
of
his
life
i
was
very
graciously
received
and
entertained
by
his
son
françois
and
his
american
wife
to
browse
among
the
master
relics
to
handle
the
old
books
of
his
small
library
to
hold
as
one
would
a
babe
of
tender
years
his
palette
were
small
things
judged
by
the
values
of
the
average
life
to
me
it
was
one
of
the
most
inspiring
hours
of
my
career
paris
was
to
me
an
art
centre
little
more
i
followed
the
footsteps
of
millet
from
one
place
to
another
i
sat
before
his
paintings
in
the
louvre
i
met
some
of
his
old
friends
and
gathered
material
for
a
lecture
on
his
work
from
paris
i
went
to
london
the
british
capital
was
more
than
an
art
centre
to
me
it
was
a
centre
literary
sociological
and
religious
i
was
the
guest
of
sir
george
williams
one
afternoon
at
one
of
his
parties
and
met
lord
radstock
whom
i
had
heard
preach
on
a
street
corner
in
whitechapel
twenty
years
before
besides
visiting
and
photographing
the
literary
haunts
of
the
great
masters
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
leaders
of
the
socialist
movement
i
went
to
albans
to
attend
the
first
convention
of
the
ruskin
societies
the
convention
was
composed
of
men
who
in
literature
and
life
were
translating
into
terms
of
life
and
labour
the
teachings
of
john
ruskin
from
london
i
went
to
oxford
and
spent
a
few
weeks
browsing
around
the
most
fascinating
city
in
the
world
to
me
my
visit
was
in
anticipation
of
the
british
convention
of
the
young
men
christian
association
to
which
i
was
a
fraternal
delegate
from
the
young
association
of
yale
university
i
was
invited
to
a
garden
party
at
blenheim
palace
while
at
oxford
i
arrived
early
and
presented
my
card
without
waiting
i
went
into
the
grounds
and
proceeded
to
enjoy
the
beautiful
walks
before
i
had
gone
far
i
met
a
young
man
who
seemed
familiar
with
the
place
i
told
him
that
i
had
once
taken
the
duchess
through
part
of
the
slum
region
of
new
york
and
expressed
a
hope
that
she
was
at
home
no
he
said
she
is
conducting
a
fair
in
london
for
wives
my
next
remark
was
in
the
realm
of
ethics
i
had
heard
that
the
father
of
the
present
duke
was
a
good
deal
of
a
rake
and
asked
the
young
man
whether
that
was
true
or
not
he
said
he
thought
it
was
like
the
obituary
notice
of
mark
twain
very
much
exaggerated
i
have
been
a
flunky
to
some
of
these
high
fliers
i
said
and
i
know
how
hard
it
is
to
get
at
the
facts
and
also
how
easy
it
is
to
form
a
mistaken
judgment
yes
he
said
that
true
but
men
of
that
type
while
they
are
often
worse
than
they
are
painted
are
more
often
much
better
than
the
best
the
public
think
of
them
i
am
the
successor
of
the
late
duke
and
speak
with
authority
on
at
least
one
case
he
took
me
through
the
palace
not
only
the
parts
usually
open
to
the
public
but
the
private
apartments
also
and
later
in
the
afternoon
he
took
me
over
some
of
the
property
at
woodstock
stopping
for
a
few
minutes
at
the
house
of
geoffrey
chaucer
the
rector
of
exeter
college
had
invited
a
group
of
the
leaders
of
the
convention
to
a
luncheon
in
exeter
and
because
i
was
the
only
american
i
was
asked
to
be
present
and
deliver
a
short
address
the
grounds
of
exeter
show
the
good
results
of
the
four
or
five
hundred
years
care
bestowed
upon
them
in
my
brief
sojourn
in
oxford
as
a
student
i
had
been
chased
out
of
the
grounds
of
exeter
by
the
caretaker
under
the
suspicion
that
i
was
a
burglar
taking
the
measure
of
the
walks
windows
doors
etc
i
told
this
story
to
a
man
with
whom
i
later
exchanged
cards
he
was
an
old
man
and
his
card
read
creese
secretary
june
you
were
in
early
brother
i
said
yes
he
said
modestly
i
was
in
he
helped
george
williams
to
organize
the
first
branch
of
the
my
story
went
the
rounds
of
those
invited
to
luncheon
and
prepared
the
way
for
the
address
i
delivered
the
first
thing
i
did
on
my
return
from
europe
was
to
visit
the
last
known
address
of
the
girl
friend
of
my
youth
it
was
in
a
negro
quarter
of
the
city
does
g
live
here
i
asked
the
coloured
woman
who
opened
the
door
she
did
mistah
but
she
done
gone
left
dis
mawnin
do
you
know
where
she
has
gone
she
done
squeezed
in
wif
ol
mammy
jackson
and
she
pointed
out
the
tenement
as
i
passed
down
the
steps
i
noticed
a
small
pile
of
furniture
on
the
sidewalk
something
impelled
me
to
ask
about
it
the
negress
said
dem
her
house
traps
d
landlord
done
gone
frow
dem
out
i
found
her
sitting
with
an
old
negress
by
the
stove
in
a
back
tenement
i
bring
you
a
message
of
love
from
your
mother
i
said
without
making
myself
known
we
talked
for
a
few
minutes
i
saw
nothing
whatever
of
the
girl
of
long
ago
there
was
a
little
of
the
voice
the
fine
musical
voice
but
nothing
of
form
nothing
of
feature
deep
lines
of
care
and
suffering
marred
her
face
and
labour
had
calloused
her
hands
she
was
poorly
dressed
had
been
ill
and
out
of
work
and
behind
in
her
rent
too
proud
to
beg
she
was
starving
with
her
neighbours
the
black
people
i
excused
myself
found
the
landlord
and
rearranged
the
home
she
had
so
heroically
struggled
to
hold
intact
do
you
remember
the
farm
at
moylena
i
asked
yes
of
course
and
a
farm
boy
yes
yes
she
said
adding
those
few
days
on
that
farm
were
the
only
happy
days
of
my
life
i
am
that
boy
and
i
have
come
to
thank
you
for
the
inspiration
you
were
to
me
so
long
ago
she
looked
at
me
intently
perhaps
searching
for
the
boy
as
i
had
been
searching
for
the
girl
there
was
a
wide
gulf
between
us
then
she
said
in
these
long
years
you
have
crossed
to
where
i
was
and
i
i
have
crossed
to
where
you
were
and
the
gulf
remains
chapter
xvi
new
haven
again
and
a
fight
in
december
the
new
haven
water
company
applied
for
a
renewal
of
its
charter
the
city
had
been
getting
nothing
for
this
valuable
franchise
and
there
was
considerable
protest
against
a
renewal
on
the
same
terms
the
trades
council
asked
the
ministers
of
the
churches
to
make
a
deliverance
on
the
question
but
there
was
no
answer
i
was
directly
challenged
to
say
something
on
the
subject
i
attended
a
hearing
in
the
city
hall
it
was
the
annual
meeting
night
of
our
church
and
i
closed
the
church
meeting
in
the
usual
manner
as
quickly
as
possible
i
made
my
way
to
the
public
hearing
the
committee
room
was
crowded
on
one
side
were
the
labouring
men
and
on
the
other
the
stockholders
and
officers
of
the
company
several
prominent
members
of
my
church
whom
i
had
missed
at
the
annual
meeting
were
in
the
committee
room
when
called
upon
to
speak
i
asked
the
committee
to
hold
the
balance
level
we
tax
a
banana
vendor
a
few
dollars
a
year
for
the
use
of
the
streets
i
said
then
why
should
a
rich
corporation
be
given
an
infinitely
larger
use
of
them
for
nothing
this
provoked
the
rich
men
of
the
church
for
most
of
them
were
stockholders
in
the
company
and
two
of
them
were
officers
the
thing
was
talked
over
afterward
in
the
back
end
of
a
small
store
where
all
the
church
policies
were
formulated
one
of
the
members
was
sent
to
the
parsonage
to
question
and
warn
me
my
visitor
spoke
of
former
pastors
who
had
been
called
of
god
elsewhere
for
much
less
than
i
had
done
another
man
came
later
and
asked
for
a
promise
that
i
would
keep
out
of
such
affairs
in
the
future
this
was
the
first
fly
in
the
ointment
the
first
break
in
the
most
cordial
of
relationships
between
me
and
the
church
the
church
had
been
organized
fifty
years
when
this
incident
occurred
we
were
preparing
to
celebrate
the
golden
jubilee
i
gathered
the
officers
together
and
we
went
over
the
articles
one
by
one
not
a
man
in
the
church
believed
in
everlasting
damnation
but
they
voted
unanimously
to
leave
the
article
just
as
they
had
found
it
they
had
all
subscribed
to
it
and
it
had
hurt
them
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
i
asked
that
none
of
you
believe
in
eternal
punishment
and
yet
you
are
going
to
force
every
man
woman
and
child
who
joins
your
church
to
solemnly
swear
before
god
that
they
do
believe
in
it
there
was
a
great
silence
yes
that
exactly
what
what
one
man
said
this
incident
illustrates
the
seared
calloused
surfeited
condition
of
the
average
mind
in
the
churches
it
is
glutted
with
sham
and
atrophied
by
the
reiteration
of
but
meaningless
pious
phrases
i
managed
to
persuade
them
to
so
amend
their
that
children
baptized
into
the
church
became
by
that
act
church
members
they
did
not
know
that
by
that
amendment
they
were
setting
aside
of
their
creed
because
they
did
know
the
creed
one
of
my
sermons
at
the
jubilee
attracted
the
attention
of
philo
bennett
a
new
york
tea
merchant
who
made
his
home
in
new
haven
we
became
very
close
friends
one
day
bennett
and
bryan
called
at
the
parsonage
i
happened
to
be
out
at
the
time
but
dined
with
them
that
evening
next
morning
a
church
member
who
was
a
sort
of
for
the
rich
men
called
at
the
parsonage
and
informed
me
of
the
disgust
of
the
leading
members
they
wo
stand
for
it
he
said
vehemently
when
i
spoke
at
the
city
hall
they
catalogued
me
as
a
socialist
and
when
bryan
called
they
moved
me
into
the
free
and
unlimited
coinage
of
silver
column
by
they
i
mean
four
or
five
men
men
of
means
who
absolutely
ruled
the
church
the
deacons
had
nothing
to
say
the
church
had
as
little
the
society
was
the
thing
the
society
in
a
congregational
church
is
a
sort
of
secular
adjunct
charged
with
the
duty
of
providing
the
material
essentials
their
word
is
law
the
only
law
in
their
estimation
business
and
religion
could
not
be
mixed
nor
could
things
of
the
church
be
permitted
to
interfere
in
politics
the
purchase
of
an
alderman
was
to
them
as
legitimate
as
the
purchase
of
a
cow
some
of
them
laughed
as
they
told
me
of
buying
an
election
in
the
borough
it
was
a
great
joke
to
them
they
were
patriotic
very
loudly
patriotic
and
their
special
hobby
was
the
majesty
of
the
law
i
was
to
be
punished
for
that
water
company
affair
and
a
man
was
selected
to
administer
the
punishment
i
had
brought
this
man
into
the
church
i
had
created
a
church
office
for
him
and
pushed
him
forward
before
the
men
he
was
supposed
to
be
my
closest
friend
he
came
to
the
parsonage
one
morning
to
talk
over
casually
the
question
of
salary
now
he
said
you
do
care
how
we
raise
your
salary
do
you
of
course
not
well
the
society
hard
up
this
year
and
can
only
raise
but
the
church
will
raise
the
other
and
i
have
one
of
them
already
promised
this
seemed
a
most
unusual
proceeding
but
i
was
unsuspecting
a
few
months
afterward
this
man
with
tears
in
his
eyes
said
irvine
whatever
happens
you
will
be
my
friend
wo
you
he
was
doing
their
work
and
wincing
under
the
load
of
it
brother
i
said
when
i
know
whether
you
are
playing
the
rôle
of
judas
or
john
i
will
be
better
able
to
answer
you
at
the
end
of
the
year
it
all
came
out
i
was
literally
fined
for
attending
that
meeting
as
my
term
of
service
drew
to
a
close
the
workingmen
who
had
joined
the
church
during
my
incumbency
got
together
they
were
in
a
majority
a
church
meeting
was
called
and
a
motion
passed
to
call
a
council
of
the
other
churches
the
purpose
of
the
call
was
to
advise
the
church
how
to
proceed
to
force
its
own
society
to
pay
the
pastor
salary
a
leading
minister
drew
up
the
call
all
ministers
knew
the
record
of
the
church
only
one
minister
in
its
history
had
left
of
his
own
accord
the
council
met
it
was
composed
of
ministers
and
laymen
of
other
churches
among
the
laymen
was
the
president
of
the
telephone
company
i
had
publicly
criticized
the
company
for
disfiguring
the
streets
with
ugly
that
looked
like
gibbets
the
president
opposition
to
me
was
well
known
the
council
under
such
influence
struck
several
technical
snags
and
adjourned
the
president
of
the
council
wrote
me
later
that
the
president
of
the
telephone
company
had
advised
him
not
to
recall
the
council
and
he
had
come
to
that
decision
concerning
the
defrauding
me
of
my
salary
the
best
people
in
that
church
to
this
day
when
speaking
of
it
say
well
we
did
owe
it
to
him
the
society
spent
the
money
in
fitting
up
the
parsonage
for
my
successor
chapter
xvii
i
join
a
labour
union
and
have
something
to
do
with
strikes
after
the
public
hearing
on
the
water
contract
several
labour
unions
elected
me
to
honorary
membership
the
carriage
makers
union
had
so
elected
me
and
a
night
was
set
for
my
initiation
it
was
a
wild
winter
night
the
streets
of
the
city
were
covered
with
snow
and
the
thermometer
registered
five
above
zero
few
men
would
come
out
a
night
like
this
who
would
expect
them
i
was
rather
glad
of
the
inclement
weather
i
was
weary
and
tired
and
hoped
the
thing
would
soon
be
over
i
entered
an
old
office
building
on
orange
street
and
climbed
to
the
top
floor
a
man
met
me
as
i
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
led
me
to
a
door
where
certain
formalities
were
performed
there
was
an
in
the
door
through
which
men
watched
each
other
there
were
whispered
words
in
an
unknown
tongue
then
a
long
pause
why
all
this
secrecy
what
means
this
vigilance
it
is
a
time
of
war
this
body
of
craftsmen
is
an
organized
regiment
the
battle
is
for
bread
before
the
door
is
opened
there
is
a
noise
like
the
sound
of
thunder
what
can
it
mean
to
what
mysterious
doings
am
i
to
become
an
i
became
a
little
anxious
perhaps
a
little
nervous
and
regretful
an
eye
appeared
at
the
hole
in
the
door
there
is
a
whispered
conference
and
i
find
myself
between
two
men
marching
up
the
centre
of
the
hall
to
the
desk
of
the
presiding
officer
my
entrance
was
the
signal
of
an
outburst
of
applause
such
as
i
had
seldom
heard
before
the
hall
was
small
and
it
was
a
mystery
how
six
hundred
men
could
be
packed
into
it
but
there
they
were
solidly
packed
on
both
sides
of
the
hall
and
as
i
marched
through
them
they
seemed
to
shake
the
whole
building
with
their
cheers
the
chairman
rapped
for
order
and
made
a
short
speech
i
ai
what
ye
call
a
christian
he
said
but
i
know
the
genuine
article
when
i
see
it
if
the
bible
is
true
jesus
went
to
the
poor
and
if
the
rich
wanted
him
they
have
to
look
him
up
do
you
fellows
ever
notice
the
church
ads
in
the
sunday
papers
they
remind
me
of
the
columns
where
ye
look
for
a
rent
they
all
advertise
their
improvements
this
minister
is
doin
th
jesus
business
in
th
old
way
that
why
we
like
him
an
that
why
he
here
once
again
the
rafters
seemed
to
shake
with
the
violent
vibrations
of
enthusiasm
and
it
was
some
time
before
order
was
restored
my
initiation
concluded
i
made
an
address
it
was
as
brief
as
the
chairman
reference
has
been
made
to
a
great
master
i
said
let
me
ask
you
craftsmen
of
new
haven
to
stand
and
with
all
the
power
of
your
lungs
give
three
cheers
for
the
master
craftsman
of
galilee
there
was
the
shuffling
of
many
feet
for
an
instant
then
a
pause
a
pause
which
was
full
of
awe
then
with
a
roar
like
thunder
six
hundred
throats
broke
into
wild
applause
for
jesus
whom
such
people
ever
gladly
heard
and
straightway
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
organized
labour
in
new
haven
a
union
meeting
was
closed
with
the
apostolic
benediction
other
unions
followed
suit
i
carried
a
union
card
of
the
painters
paper
hangers
and
decorators
and
there
came
a
time
when
every
street
car
on
the
streets
of
new
haven
carried
at
least
two
of
my
friends
for
i
became
chaplain
of
the
trolleymen
union
and
took
an
active
part
in
their
work
i
was
a
factor
in
the
wage
scale
adjustments
of
the
trolleymen
union
for
two
years
i
fought
for
them
when
they
were
right
and
against
them
when
they
were
wrong
i
fought
on
the
inside
at
first
the
railroad
company
looked
upon
me
as
a
dangerous
character
but
when
their
spies
in
the
union
reported
my
actions
the
general
manager
wrote
me
a
letter
of
thanks
and
thereafter
took
me
into
his
confidence
the
public
also
looked
upon
me
as
inimical
to
the
interests
of
business
but
occasionally
the
newspapers
got
at
the
facts
and
published
them
the
new
haven
of
august
in
its
leading
editorial
on
an
averted
strike
said
there
is
a
general
feeling
in
new
haven
of
satisfaction
in
the
news
published
in
yesterday
papers
that
the
trolleymen
plans
for
a
strike
had
been
relegated
to
the
ash
heap
the
trolleymen
were
evidently
satisfied
with
the
attitude
of
the
railroad
managers
and
satisfied
that
they
were
going
to
get
fair
treatment
we
read
with
unusual
pleasure
the
reports
of
at
the
meeting
and
cheers
not
for
the
little
pleasantries
of
battle
but
for
the
friendly
propositions
of
peace
the
sentiment
shown
by
the
trolleymen
does
full
justice
to
their
record
as
and
intelligent
public
servants
one
or
two
phases
of
the
completion
of
peace
negotiations
in
the
local
trolley
situation
call
for
particular
notice
here
and
now
we
do
not
remember
for
instance
to
have
heard
for
some
time
of
the
active
participation
in
labour
agitations
of
a
regularly
ordained
clergyman
of
the
christian
church
we
noted
therefore
with
respectful
interest
the
manner
in
which
the
reverend
alexander
irvine
took
part
in
the
meeting
at
which
the
final
decision
was
made
and
especially
the
influence
which
he
brought
to
bear
to
clear
the
atmosphere
usually
sympathizers
with
the
cause
of
labour
agitation
are
the
principal
advisers
at
such
a
time
we
remember
and
the
trolleymen
certainly
do
that
at
the
critical
juncture
several
summers
ago
when
a
final
decision
was
to
have
been
rendered
by
the
striking
trolleymen
an
agitator
from
bridgeport
not
only
agitated
but
nearly
managed
to
turn
the
balance
toward
an
irreparable
break
in
negotiations
we
remember
that
new
haven
people
absolutely
lost
all
patience
at
that
juncture
and
would
have
stampeded
from
their
thorough
sympathy
with
the
trolleymen
cause
had
not
better
wisdom
finally
prevailed
irvine
seems
to
have
occupied
that
gentleman
shoes
at
the
saturday
night
meeting
and
to
have
acquitted
himself
much
more
to
the
taste
of
the
public
his
interest
was
we
take
it
purely
that
of
any
citizen
who
has
studied
labour
questions
sufficiently
to
arrive
at
a
fair
and
unprejudiced
point
of
view
and
who
moreover
possessed
the
requisite
balance
of
mind
and
sincerity
of
purpose
to
counsel
when
his
counsel
was
asked
judicially
there
was
absolutely
lacking
in
his
whole
connection
with
the
case
any
of
that
uncertain
theorizing
that
makes
the
attitude
of
so
many
labour
so
detrimental
in
the
public
eye
to
real
labour
benefit
new
haven
has
considerable
to
thank
irvine
for
in
his
attitude
in
the
past
crisis
more
sound
advice
and
friendly
counsel
and
wise
sympathy
from
such
men
as
he
are
needed
in
labour
troubles
another
new
haven
paper
commenting
editorially
on
my
attitude
toward
a
strike
carried
on
by
the
bakers
union
said
we
commend
to
the
connecticut
railway
and
lighting
company
which
has
now
practically
four
strikes
on
its
hands
in
two
connecticut
cities
the
sentiment
of
the
reverend
alexander
irvine
in
his
sermon
last
sunday
night
in
reference
to
the
striking
bakers
of
this
city
who
declared
against
a
proposition
to
arbitrate
with
the
bosses
they
have
nothing
to
arbitrate
said
irvine
have
nothing
to
strike
about
the
proposition
would
seem
to
involve
a
sound
principle
of
business
ethics
an
honest
disagreement
is
always
arbitrable
a
body
of
workmen
who
make
a
demand
which
they
are
unwilling
to
submit
to
the
judgment
of
a
fair
and
intelligent
committee
deserve
little
sympathy
if
they
lose
their
fight
and
an
employer
who
refuses
to
entrust
his
case
to
the
honesty
fairness
and
justice
of
a
committee
of
respectable
citizens
representing
the
best
element
of
that
public
from
which
he
derives
his
support
must
not
be
surprised
if
he
loses
public
sympathy
i
was
elected
a
member
of
the
teamsters
union
while
the
teamsters
were
on
strike
i
was
in
their
headquarters
night
and
day
doing
what
i
could
for
them
but
i
was
unable
to
offset
the
bad
leadership
which
landed
nine
of
them
in
jail
on
may
i
left
pilgrim
church
my
farewell
sermon
was
a
fair
statement
of
the
case
the
sermon
was
published
in
the
press
the
hartford
made
the
following
editorial
comments
on
it
one
church
and
its
pastor
plain
speaking
is
so
much
out
of
fashion
that
when
examples
of
it
are
discovered
they
rivet
attention
undoubtedly
there
was
a
good
deal
in
the
farewell
sermon
of
the
reverend
alexander
irvine
who
has
just
closed
a
pastorate
of
four
and
years
in
the
pilgrim
congregational
church
in
new
haven
that
was
applicable
only
to
that
church
but
possibly
some
statements
have
more
or
less
general
application
at
any
rate
it
is
an
interesting
case
and
the
sermon
was
remarkable
for
its
almost
brutal
directness
its
cutting
satire
its
searching
exposition
of
the
wholesale
spirit
of
charity
mixed
with
kindly
humour
which
runs
through
it
after
four
years
and
six
months
of
labour
a
clergyman
is
certainly
qualified
to
speak
of
the
characteristics
of
the
pastorate
in
most
cases
the
farewell
sermon
is
however
a
mass
of
generalities
a
formal
perfunctory
affair
often
it
is
omitted
altogether
the
pastor
simply
goes
out
leaving
the
church
to
its
fate
commending
it
to
the
care
of
the
almighty
his
private
views
are
not
expressed
irvine
retired
in
considerable
turmoil
but
he
made
his
parting
memorable
by
expressing
his
sentiments
and
his
frankness
was
absolute
in
reviewing
his
pastorate
irvine
spoke
of
the
services
on
wednesday
nights
the
men
bible
class
and
a
group
of
sixty
added
to
the
church
at
its
fiftieth
anniversary
as
among
the
happy
features
of
his
administration
but
he
went
on
to
say
that
those
new
members
were
not
welcomed
by
the
because
they
brought
no
money
into
the
treasury
the
clash
that
went
on
during
those
four
and
years
is
revealed
by
what
the
pastor
said
on
this
matter
he
tried
to
democratize
the
church
he
wanted
to
get
in
blood
he
tried
to
interest
the
workingmen
as
many
other
pastors
have
tried
to
do
and
are
trying
to
do
with
varying
success
we
hear
a
great
deal
about
the
church
and
the
masses
how
they
are
drifting
apart
here
is
a
minister
who
tried
to
bring
them
together
he
had
services
when
all
seats
were
free
and
workingmen
were
invited
he
interested
many
of
them
and
many
joined
the
church
but
the
attempt
was
a
failure
for
the
church
as
a
whole
did
take
kindly
to
people
without
money
the
making
of
a
deacon
said
irvine
is
a
quality
sought
after
but
the
qualifications
for
the
society
committee
is
cash
cold
cash
if
there
is
a
deviation
from
this
rule
it
is
on
the
score
of
patronage
power
in
the
case
of
the
former
is
a
rope
of
sand
in
the
latter
it
is
law
again
on
this
line
irvine
said
was
inevitable
that
these
workingmen
should
be
weighed
by
their
contributions
that
is
the
standard
of
the
society
how
true
it
is
that
this
standard
is
applied
in
more
churches
than
the
pilgrim
church
in
new
haven
those
who
are
in
the
churches
know
it
is
not
true
of
course
universally
but
this
is
not
by
any
means
an
isolated
case
possibly
the
organization
of
the
congregational
churches
is
faulty
in
this
respect
there
is
the
church
and
there
is
the
society
the
society
committee
runs
the
business
of
the
church
it
is
apt
to
be
made
up
of
men
to
whom
the
dollar
is
most
essential
and
often
the
committee
exercises
absolute
power
in
most
of
the
affairs
of
the
church
in
this
case
it
froze
out
a
man
who
wanted
to
go
out
and
bring
in
men
from
the
highways
and
byways
and
now
he
has
gone
to
establish
what
he
calls
the
church
of
the
democracy
it
is
to
be
a
church
independent
of
the
rich
there
are
such
churches
not
many
to
be
sure
but
they
come
pretty
close
to
the
gospel
of
the
new
testament
man
here
may
do
one
of
three
things
said
the
democratic
clergyman
in
his
address
may
degenerate
and
conform
to
type
he
may
stay
for
three
or
four
years
by
the
aid
of
diplomacy
and
much
grace
he
may
go
mad
therefore
an
essential
qualification
for
this
pastorate
is
a
keen
sense
of
humour
if
my
successor
has
this
he
will
enjoy
the
community
ministry
for
a
few
years
and
will
do
much
good
among
the
children
he
will
enjoy
the
view
from
the
parsonage
the
bay
the
river
the
mountains
he
will
make
friends
too
of
some
of
the
most
genuinely
good
people
on
earth
he
must
come
as
i
came
believing
this
place
to
be
a
suburb
of
paradise
and
blessed
will
that
man
be
if
he
departs
before
he
changes
his
mind
that
is
satire
and
possibly
out
of
place
in
the
pulpit
but
it
may
be
that
the
words
could
be
applied
without
stretching
the
truth
to
other
pastorates
preacher
is
their
hired
man
he
may
be
brainy
but
not
too
brainy
social
but
not
too
social
religious
but
not
too
religious
he
must
trim
his
sails
to
suit
every
breeze
of
the
community
his
mental
qualities
must
be
acceptable
to
the
contemporary
ancestors
by
whom
he
is
surrounded
or
he
does
not
fit
the
bitterness
in
those
words
is
evident
but
the
truths
they
contain
are
important
it
may
be
that
more
sermons
with
equal
plain
speaking
would
do
good
it
may
be
that
the
conservatism
not
to
say
the
phariseeism
of
the
modern
church
requires
a
john
the
baptist
to
pierce
it
to
the
core
and
expose
its
inner
rottenness
the
church
that
does
not
welcome
the
poor
man
and
his
family
with
just
as
much
heartiness
sincerity
and
kindly
sympathy
as
it
does
the
rich
man
and
his
family
is
certainly
not
worthy
of
the
great
teacher
who
spoke
of
the
great
difficulty
the
rich
man
has
in
entering
the
kingdom
of
god
i
have
delivered
about
two
written
sermons
in
years
that
farewell
message
was
one
of
them
i
wanted
to
be
careful
fair
just
i
could
not
escape
the
belief
that
at
least
seven
of
my
predecessors
who
had
been
pushed
out
by
unfair
means
had
left
with
a
lie
on
their
lips
pastor
and
people
in
dissolving
relationship
had
always
assumed
and
often
explicitly
stated
on
the
records
that
the
departing
minister
had
been
called
of
god
elsewhere
if
god
was
the
author
of
their
methods
of
dismissal
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
there
was
no
interregnum
the
sunday
following
that
farewell
sermon
i
preached
my
first
sermon
as
pastor
of
the
newly
organized
church
of
new
haven
about
thirty
people
left
the
old
church
and
joined
the
new
among
them
was
a
saintly
woman
who
had
been
a
member
for
half
a
century
of
pilgrim
church
we
had
one
man
of
means
philo
sherman
bennett
the
friend
of
bryan
the
opening
meeting
was
in
the
hyperion
theatre
the
creed
was
simple
and
brevity
itself
this
church
is
a
community
for
the
worship
of
god
and
the
service
of
man
a
jewish
rabbi
read
the
scriptures
a
universalist
minister
made
an
address
and
a
judge
of
the
city
led
in
prayer
part
of
my
address
was
a
series
of
serious
questions
will
this
movement
raise
the
tone
of
society
will
it
increase
mutual
confidence
will
it
diminish
intemperance
will
it
find
the
people
uneducated
and
leave
them
educated
will
the
voice
of
its
leader
be
lifted
in
the
cause
of
justice
and
humanity
will
it
tend
after
all
to
elevate
or
lower
the
moral
sentiments
of
mankind
will
it
increase
the
love
of
truth
or
the
power
of
superstition
or
will
it
divide
or
unite
the
world
will
it
leave
the
minds
of
men
clearer
and
more
enlightened
or
will
it
add
another
element
of
confusion
to
the
chaos
these
are
the
tests
we
put
to
this
new
church
and
to
our
personal
lives
we
had
an
old
hall
in
the
outskirts
of
the
city
on
a
railroad
bank
there
we
opened
our
sunday
school
and
began
our
church
activities
i
got
a
band
of
yale
men
to
go
to
work
at
the
hall
the
son
of
senator
crane
of
massachusetts
became
head
of
the
movement
but
that
plan
was
spoiled
by
a
man
of
the
english
lutheran
persuasion
who
was
an
instructor
in
yale
it
appeared
that
the
church
of
which
this
man
was
a
member
had
been
trying
to
rent
this
old
hall
and
not
succeeding
in
that
they
claimed
the
community
this
instructor
complained
to
the
yale
authorities
and
without
a
word
to
me
the
yale
band
was
withdrawn
a
few
weeks
after
the
lutherans
claimed
another
community
and
went
to
work
in
it
in
the
middle
of
our
first
year
our
little
church
received
a
staggering
blow
in
the
death
of
philo
bennett
we
had
become
very
intimate
i
dined
with
him
once
a
week
he
was
about
to
retire
from
business
and
after
a
rest
he
was
to
give
his
time
to
the
church
idea
he
inquired
about
buildings
and
he
had
fixed
his
mind
on
a
structure
he
spoke
to
others
of
these
plans
but
in
idaho
that
summer
he
was
killed
in
an
accident
bennett
sent
for
me
and
i
took
charge
of
the
funeral
arrangements
bryan
came
on
at
once
and
helped
after
the
funeral
he
read
and
discussed
the
will
i
was
present
at
several
of
these
discussions
the
sealed
letter
written
by
the
dead
man
was
the
bone
of
contention
then
the
lawyers
came
in
and
the
case
went
into
the
courts
the
world
knew
but
a
fragment
of
the
truth
it
looked
to
me
at
first
as
if
a
selfish
motive
actuated
bryan
but
as
i
got
at
the
details
one
after
another
details
the
world
can
never
know
i
developed
a
profound
respect
for
him
he
was
the
only
person
involved
that
cared
anything
for
the
mind
will
or
intention
of
the
dead
man
and
his
entire
legal
battle
was
not
that
he
should
get
what
bennett
had
willed
him
but
that
the
designs
of
his
friend
should
not
be
frustrated
not
merely
with
regard
to
the
fifty
thousand
he
offered
to
distribute
that
but
with
regard
to
the
money
for
poor
students
we
missed
bennett
not
only
for
his
moral
and
financial
help
but
because
of
his
great
business
ability
during
the
coal
strike
of
for
instance
when
coal
was
beyond
the
reach
of
the
poor
we
organized
among
the
working
people
a
coal
company
the
coal
dealers
blocked
our
plans
everywhere
we
were
shut
out
then
the
idea
came
to
us
to
charter
a
shipload
and
bring
it
from
glasgow
it
was
the
keen
business
ability
of
bennett
that
helped
us
to
success
we
needed
to
cable
over
i
laid
the
plans
before
bennett
he
went
over
them
carefully
and
put
up
the
money
before
we
needed
it
however
we
had
sold
stock
at
a
dollar
a
share
and
the
coal
in
scotland
brought
in
an
amount
beyond
our
immediate
needs
this
of
course
was
interfering
with
business
men
affairs
and
the
dealers
in
coal
were
not
slow
to
express
themselves
i
was
a
director
of
the
coal
company
for
some
time
the
newspapers
announced
that
i
was
going
into
the
coal
business
to
make
a
living
but
i
had
neither
desire
nor
ability
in
that
direction
it
was
a
great
day
in
new
haven
when
our
ship
entered
the
harbour
and
broke
the
siege
we
sold
coal
for
half
the
current
price
the
idea
of
a
church
building
had
held
a
number
of
people
in
our
little
church
for
a
long
time
but
after
bennett
death
that
hope
seemed
to
die
and
those
to
whom
a
church
home
was
more
than
a
church
left
us
those
of
that
mind
that
did
leave
voluntarily
were
lured
away
by
ministers
who
had
a
building
the
amount
of
ecclesiastical
pilfering
that
goes
on
in
a
small
city
like
new
haven
is
surprising
conversion
is
a
lost
art
or
a
lost
experience
and
the
average
minister
whose
reputation
and
salary
depend
upon
the
number
of
people
he
can
corral
usually
has
two
fields
of
action
one
is
the
sunday
school
and
the
other
is
the
loose
membership
of
other
churches
the
theft
is
usually
deliberate
when
my
income
was
about
forty
dollars
a
month
subscribed
by
very
poor
people
a
pastor
who
had
been
building
up
his
church
at
the
expense
of
his
neighbours
wrote
me
that
he
was
trying
to
persuade
one
of
our
members
to
join
his
church
it
was
the
most
brazen
thing
i
had
ever
known
he
felt
that
our
dissolution
was
a
matter
of
time
and
he
wanted
his
share
of
the
wreckage
he
went
after
the
only
person
in
our
church
who
had
an
income
that
more
than
supplied
personal
needs
afterward
this
same
minister
entered
into
a
deal
with
the
trustees
of
the
hall
we
used
by
which
the
hall
and
the
sunday
school
were
handed
over
to
him
of
course
we
made
no
fight
over
the
thing
we
just
let
him
take
them
this
is
called
bringing
in
the
kingdom
of
god
we
were
not
free
from
dissension
within
our
own
ranks
either
bryan
came
to
lecture
for
us
in
the
largest
theatre
in
town
admission
was
to
be
by
ticket
on
sunday
afternoon
the
committee
of
our
church
that
took
charge
of
the
tickets
began
to
distribute
seats
the
best
seats
and
boxes
to
their
personal
friends
thousands
were
clamouring
for
tickets
it
was
an
opportunity
to
give
the
city
a
big
helpful
meeting
and
to
do
it
democratically
and
well
but
the
committee
would
brook
no
interference
i
announced
in
the
papers
that
all
tickets
were
general
admissions
and
first
come
first
served
would
be
our
principle
sunday
morning
when
i
was
through
my
discourse
one
of
the
committee
handed
me
a
note
i
did
not
open
it
until
i
finished
it
was
a
threat
that
if
i
did
not
call
off
the
democratic
order
the
committee
would
leave
the
church
the
meeting
was
a
great
success
and
the
committee
made
good
its
threat
what
the
writer
of
the
following
letter
expected
of
me
i
have
no
idea
nor
did
his
letter
enlighten
me
dear
ser
wen
i
gave
my
name
for
a
church
member
it
was
fer
a
peeples
church
not
a
solo
and
labour
union
church
drop
my
name
we
had
at
our
opening
a
solo
by
the
finest
singer
in
the
city
and
i
had
thanked
the
labour
unions
for
their
help
his
name
was
dropped
an
educated
woman
thought
she
saw
in
our
simple
creed
an
open
door
she
had
been
seeking
for
years
she
joined
us
with
enthusiasm
one
day
i
was
calling
on
her
and
as
i
sat
by
the
door
i
saw
a
dark
figure
pass
with
a
sack
of
coal
on
his
back
the
figure
looked
familiar
pardon
me
i
said
as
i
stepped
out
to
make
sure
hello
fritz
i
called
the
coal
heaver
had
only
trousers
and
an
undershirt
on
and
looked
as
black
as
a
negro
sweat
poured
over
his
face
we
gripped
hands
the
lady
watched
us
with
interest
do
you
know
him
she
asked
yes
indeed
i
said
and
you
must
know
him
for
he
is
one
of
our
deacons
she
never
came
back
democracy
like
that
was
too
much
for
her
the
deacon
himself
left
our
church
a
few
months
later
because
he
discovered
that
i
did
not
believe
in
a
literal
hell
of
fire
and
brimstone
whatever
that
is
the
chairman
of
our
trustees
was
a
business
man
who
was
very
much
engrossed
with
the
new
thought
he
saw
a
great
future
for
me
if
i
would
get
in
tune
with
the
infinite
i
was
more
than
willing
he
expounded
to
me
the
wonders
of
the
new
régime
would
i
take
lessons
in
healing
certainly
he
paid
an
american
yogi
a
hundred
dollars
to
teach
me
i
was
unaware
of
the
cost
at
first
it
was
by
correspondence
his
chirography
looked
like
a
plate
of
spaghetti
i
was
instructed
how
to
take
a
bath
and
when
the
second
letter
ordered
me
to
sleep
with
my
head
to
the
east
i
was
a
capricorner
buoyant
lucky
so
he
said
at
the
end
of
a
month
i
paid
him
a
visit
he
showed
me
how
to
manipulate
a
patient
absent
or
present
and
how
to
charge
the
correspondence
was
taken
verbatim
from
a
book
on
astrology
i
got
tired
and
handed
the
letters
over
to
my
wife
she
took
them
seriously
and
when
she
had
made
what
she
thought
was
progress
she
inadvertently
told
the
chairman
of
the
trustees
that
settled
him
he
resigned
forthwith
and
we
saw
him
no
more
i
thought
we
had
reached
the
point
where
there
was
nothing
further
to
lose
but
i
was
mistaken
i
had
been
charged
with
being
a
socialist
and
curious
to
know
what
a
socialist
was
i
began
to
study
the
subject
what
i
feared
came
upon
me
i
announced
myself
a
socialist
that
settled
the
single
taxers
they
left
in
a
bunch
no
hardly
in
a
bunch
for
two
of
them
remained
the
universalists
invited
us
to
use
their
church
for
our
sunday
night
meetings
we
thought
that
a
fortunate
windfall
we
were
to
pay
five
dollars
a
night
we
did
so
until
one
week
we
had
nothing
to
eat
and
we
let
the
rent
wait
the
trustees
of
the
universalist
church
met
and
passed
a
resolution
something
like
this
resolved
that
in
order
that
the
good
feeling
existing
between
the
people
church
and
the
universalist
church
be
maintained
that
the
people
church
be
requested
to
pay
the
rent
after
each
service
we
paid
up
and
quit
the
most
intelligent
man
in
our
church
was
a
young
draftsman
in
the
winchester
arms
company
he
was
a
man
of
boundless
energy
and
great
courage
he
lost
his
job
no
reason
was
given
his
wife
before
her
marriage
had
been
a
trained
nurse
and
in
her
professional
life
had
nursed
the
wife
of
a
bank
president
who
was
a
director
in
the
gun
company
one
day
these
ladies
met
and
the
lady
of
the
bank
said
she
would
find
out
why
the
husband
of
her
former
nurse
was
discharged
the
director
got
at
the
facts
and
gave
them
to
his
wife
he
belongs
to
irvine
church
and
irvine
is
an
anarchist
the
young
man
got
another
job
in
another
city
after
a
few
discharges
of
that
kind
men
who
did
not
want
to
leave
the
city
got
scared
and
gave
me
a
wide
berth
i
looked
around
for
something
to
do
to
earn
a
living
i
found
a
young
bookbinder
in
a
commercial
house
and
as
he
was
a
master
craftsman
i
advised
him
to
hang
out
a
shingle
and
work
for
himself
he
did
so
when
i
was
casting
around
for
a
new
method
of
earning
a
living
i
thought
of
him
and
asked
him
to
take
me
as
an
apprentice
he
did
so
and
i
put
an
apron
on
and
began
to
work
at
his
bench
one
day
when
the
reporters
were
hard
up
for
news
one
of
them
called
for
an
interview
have
you
ever
published
any
sermons
mr
irvine
yes
one
and
a
fine
one
where
was
it
published
right
here
in
new
haven
a
volume
yes
i
went
to
my
case
and
produced
a
book
i
had
sewed
it
backed
it
bound
and
tooled
it
it
was
my
first
job
and
i
was
proud
of
it
i
am
proud
of
it
now
it
is
the
best
sermon
i
ever
preached
another
day
a
professor
in
the
yale
medical
school
called
to
have
some
books
bound
at
the
bindery
who
is
that
fellow
at
your
bench
he
asked
irvine
the
bookbinder
replied
the
socialist
yes
he
took
the
young
man
aside
and
told
him
that
he
could
expect
no
recognition
from
the
best
citizens
as
long
as
he
kept
me
off
came
my
apron
and
i
looked
around
again
i
was
very
fond
of
munger
in
his
vigorous
days
his
was
a
great
intellect
and
when
in
his
study
one
day
he
told
me
that
i
had
no
gospel
to
preach
i
felt
deeply
the
injustice
of
the
charge
i
could
not
argue
i
would
not
defend
myself
i
valued
his
friendship
too
highly
i
hit
upon
a
plan
however
i
had
published
in
a
labour
paper
seventeen
sermons
for
working
people
i
went
to
a
printer
and
told
him
that
if
he
would
print
them
in
a
book
i
would
peddle
them
from
door
to
door
until
i
got
the
printer
bill
they
were
printed
in
a
neat
volume
entitled
the
master
and
the
chisel
i
paid
the
printer
bill
and
gave
the
rest
away
i
sent
one
to
munger
and
this
is
what
he
said
of
it
dear
irvine
many
thanks
for
the
little
book
you
sent
me
i
have
read
nearly
all
the
brief
chapters
and
this
would
not
be
the
case
if
they
were
dull
that
they
certainly
are
not
nor
would
they
have
held
my
interest
if
they
did
not
in
the
main
strike
me
as
true
i
can
say
more
namely
that
they
seem
to
me
admirably
suited
to
the
people
you
have
in
charge
and
good
for
anybody
they
have
at
least
done
me
good
and
often
stirred
me
deeply
their
strong
point
is
the
humanity
that
runs
along
their
pages
along
with
a
sincere
reverence
i
hope
they
will
have
a
wide
circulation
the
tide
was
ebbing
but
it
was
not
yet
out
the
announcement
that
i
was
a
socialist
brought
of
course
the
members
of
the
party
around
me
but
on
sunday
nights
when
they
came
expecting
a
discourse
on
economic
determinism
and
found
me
searching
for
the
hidden
springs
of
the
heart
and
the
larger
personal
life
as
well
as
the
larger
social
life
they
went
away
disappointed
and
never
came
back
as
i
looked
around
however
at
the
churches
and
the
university
i
could
find
nothing
to
equal
the
social
passion
of
the
socialists
it
was
a
religion
with
them
true
they
were
limited
in
their
expression
of
that
passion
but
they
were
live
coals
all
of
them
and
i
was
more
at
home
in
their
meetings
than
in
the
churches
chapter
xviii
i
become
a
socialist
i
soon
joined
the
party
and
gave
myself
body
soul
and
spirit
to
the
socialists
propaganda
the
quest
for
a
living
took
me
to
a
little
farm
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
there
were
eighteen
acres
sixteen
of
them
stones
gradually
i
began
to
feel
that
my
rejection
was
not
a
mere
matter
of
being
let
alone
of
ignoring
me
it
was
a
positive
attitude
there
was
a
design
to
drive
me
out
of
the
city
on
the
farm
i
was
without
the
gates
in
person
but
my
influence
was
within
among
the
workers
we
spent
every
penny
we
had
on
the
farm
i
hired
a
neighbouring
farmer
to
plow
my
ground
and
plant
my
seed
for
i
had
neither
horse
nor
machinery
i
told
him
i
had
a
little
cottage
in
the
woods
in
massachusetts
that
i
was
offering
for
sale
and
i
would
pay
him
out
of
the
proceeds
at
first
he
believed
me
and
did
the
work
it
took
me
two
months
to
get
that
cottage
sold
and
get
the
money
for
it
the
farmer
son
camped
on
my
doorstep
daily
every
day
i
met
him
in
the
fields
or
on
the
road
i
spoke
in
such
soft
tones
and
promised
so
volubly
every
time
he
approached
me
that
he
got
the
impression
that
i
had
no
cottage
that
i
was
a
fraud
and
cheating
his
father
he
spread
that
impression
he
began
after
a
while
to
insult
me
to
make
fun
of
me
i
debated
with
myself
one
afternoon
whether
when
he
again
repeated
his
insults
i
should
thrash
him
or
treat
him
as
a
joke
i
decided
on
the
former
meantime
the
check
for
the
cottage
came
and
relieved
the
situation
despite
my
inability
to
become
a
yogi
i
believed
in
the
new
thought
my
wife
and
i
used
to
hold
the
thought
make
the
mental
picture
and
go
into
the
silence
we
did
this
regularly
i
had
an
old
counterfeit
bill
for
a
decoy
i
shut
my
eyes
and
imagined
myself
stuffing
big
bundles
of
them
into
the
of
my
desk
i
got
an
incubator
filled
it
with
buff
orpington
eggs
and
kept
the
thermometer
at
my
knees
grew
as
hard
as
a
goat
from
watching
it
in
the
course
of
events
two
chickens
came
we
had
pictured
the
yard
literally
covered
with
them
these
poor
things
broke
their
legs
over
the
eggs
my
wife
was
more
optimistic
than
i
was
wait
she
said
these
things
are
often
several
days
late
so
we
waited
waited
ten
days
and
then
refilled
the
thing
and
began
all
over
again
we
lost
an
old
hen
that
was
so
worthless
that
we
never
looked
for
her
in
the
fullness
of
her
time
she
returned
with
a
brood
of
fourteen
she
had
been
in
the
silence
to
some
purpose
well
let
let
the
hens
alone
my
wife
said
with
a
sigh
they
know
this
business
better
than
we
do
but
we
kept
on
monkeying
with
mental
images
it
was
great
fun
during
our
stay
on
that
farm
i
did
four
times
more
pastoral
work
than
i
had
ever
done
in
my
life
i
was
the
minister
of
the
nondescript
and
the
destitute
i
presided
over
funerals
weddings
baptisms
strikes
protests
mass
meetings
nobody
thought
of
paying
anything
to
those
i
served
i
had
a
sort
of
halo
a
wall
of
mystery
to
me
it
was
often
the
halo
of
hunger
of
the
wolf
and
the
wall
yes
a
wall
truly
and
very
high
that
separated
me
from
my
own
an
incident
will
show
what
my
brethren
thought
of
my
service
to
the
poor
i
was
in
the
public
library
one
day
when
the
scribe
of
the
ministerial
association
to
which
i
belonged
accosted
me
hello
irvine
hello
c
splendid
weather
we
having
is
it
splendid
replied
c
and
in
the
same
breath
he
said
say
you
do
come
around
to
the
association
do
you
want
your
name
kept
on
the
roll
i
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
said
whatever
would
give
you
most
pleasure
brother
leaving
it
on
or
taking
it
off
do
that
that
was
all
not
another
word
he
reported
that
i
wanted
my
name
removed
and
that
practically
ended
my
ministerial
standing
in
the
congregational
ministry
the
jewish
rabbi
who
had
taken
part
in
our
opening
service
met
me
on
the
street
one
day
smyth
and
i
are
coming
to
see
you
irvine
he
said
i
be
mighty
glad
to
see
you
both
rabbi
what
are
you
coming
for
well
we
think
it
too
bad
that
the
labour
gang
use
you
as
a
sucker
and
we
want
to
see
if
we
ca
get
a
place
in
some
mission
for
you
rabbi
some
of
your
rich
jews
have
been
after
you
for
appearing
on
our
platform
come
now
is
that
so
well
it
because
they
believe
as
i
believe
that
you
are
used
as
a
sucker
i
do
like
your
word
rabbi
but
there
are
fifty
ministers
in
town
if
capital
has
suckers
why
not
let
labour
have
one
that
made
him
rather
furious
and
he
said
you
remind
me
of
jesus
a
fanatic
he
died
at
when
he
might
have
lived
to
a
good
old
age
and
done
some
good
that
i
said
is
the
highest
compliment
i
have
ever
received
i
bared
my
head
at
the
word
and
then
left
him
on
the
sidewalk
the
new
haven
water
company
managed
to
get
what
was
called
an
eternal
contract
passed
through
both
chambers
of
the
city
government
only
labouring
people
opposed
it
naturally
there
was
a
strong
suspicion
of
foul
play
illustration
state
convention
of
the
socialist
party
of
connecticut
may
a
year
afterward
a
man
came
to
me
with
a
full
of
documents
he
had
been
expert
for
the
water
company
and
knew
the
facts
and
figures
for
years
among
them
were
two
cancelled
checks
one
for
a
thousand
which
was
made
out
by
and
to
the
president
and
dated
the
day
a
certain
committee
was
to
meet
to
go
over
the
terms
of
the
contract
the
other
was
made
out
to
a
shyster
lawyer
and
was
for
fifteen
thousand
he
expected
to
create
a
sensation
the
thing
had
worked
on
his
conscience
until
it
became
unbearable
he
came
to
me
because
of
what
he
had
learned
of
me
at
the
water
company
office
it
takes
a
civic
conscience
to
deal
with
such
a
problem
and
new
haven
had
no
such
thing
at
that
time
he
took
the
documents
from
one
place
to
another
to
ministers
lawyers
judges
legislators
etc
nothing
could
be
done
they
were
all
the
personal
friends
of
the
officials
the
papers
would
print
anything
about
it
the
said
he
thought
he
knew
why
editors
never
had
any
water
bills
some
radicals
got
the
big
check
printed
in
facsimile
and
scattered
it
abroad
the
aldermen
had
been
bought
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
but
it
was
a
matter
of
business
the
whole
agitation
came
back
on
the
reformers
like
a
boomerang
leading
politicians
determined
to
do
something
to
vindicate
the
leading
citizen
who
had
been
accused
they
elected
him
to
the
state
senate
a
city
of
a
hundred
thousand
can
by
either
a
positive
or
a
negative
process
destroy
the
usefulness
of
any
man
who
would
be
its
servant
i
felt
my
loneliness
very
keenly
indeed
so
much
so
that
it
was
often
as
though
i
had
committed
a
great
crime
always
however
at
the
came
a
word
of
cheer
a
note
of
approval
bishop
lines
of
newark
new
jersey
who
was
then
rector
of
church
sent
me
a
note
that
reached
me
in
a
dark
hour
i
do
not
suppose
he
said
that
i
look
at
things
as
you
do
in
all
respects
but
i
would
like
to
assure
you
of
my
great
regard
for
you
and
of
my
implicit
faith
in
your
sincerity
and
goodness
i
know
that
the
world
great
sorrow
rests
upon
your
heart
and
that
many
men
who
feel
it
not
sit
in
judgment
upon
you
the
people
church
dwindled
to
a
vanishing
point
the
farm
produced
nothing
autumn
came
and
we
lived
largely
upon
apples
make
a
break
my
wife
said
but
it
seemed
like
running
away
from
the
fight
the
fight
was
already
over
and
i
was
beaten
beaten
but
unaware
of
defeat
one
morning
i
was
at
the
top
of
a
big
apple
tree
shaking
it
for
three
italian
women
whom
we
believed
to
be
worse
off
than
ourselves
a
branch
broke
and
i
fell
on
my
back
on
a
boulder
i
lay
as
one
dead
my
wife
found
me
there
and
hailed
a
passing
grocer
wagon
the
boy
whipped
up
his
horse
to
bring
a
doctor
but
on
the
way
spread
the
news
that
i
had
been
killed
by
a
fall
among
the
first
callers
after
the
accident
were
donald
mitchell
and
his
daughter
my
neighbours
i
lay
on
a
mattress
on
the
lawn
all
afternoon
in
great
agony
although
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
we
scraped
together
the
dollars
a
month
for
the
farm
my
wife
putting
her
philosophy
of
the
new
thought
to
the
test
had
rented
a
house
in
the
city
at
seventy
dollars
a
month
when
she
rented
it
we
had
seventy
cents
we
were
to
move
into
it
the
day
of
the
accident
i
insisted
that
we
proceed
send
for
jimmy
moohan
i
said
jimmy
was
a
genial
old
irish
expressman
whose
stand
was
at
the
new
haven
green
jimmy
came
and
looked
me
over
then
came
bob
grant
a
foreman
from
a
manufacturing
concern
and
after
him
four
socialist
comrades
on
their
way
home
from
work
ah
mother
o
god
jimmy
said
shure
it
an
ambulance
yer
riverence
shud
haave
i
want
you
jimmy
pile
me
in
holy
saints
he
exclaimed
shure
th
ould
cyart
jolt
yer
guts
out
pile
me
in
so
they
lifted
me
on
the
mattress
and
laid
me
in
the
express
wagon
bob
grant
sat
beside
me
the
four
comrades
steadied
it
two
on
each
side
git
up
now
larry
an
be
aisy
wid
ye
when
the
wagon
wheel
mounted
a
stone
jimmy
blamed
larry
and
swore
at
him
occasionally
he
would
turn
around
and
say
how
it
goin
yer
riverence
i
was
in
such
agony
that
i
sweat
pains
were
shooting
through
every
part
of
my
body
but
i
usually
answered
fine
jimmy
fine
so
i
came
back
within
the
gates
of
the
city
rejected
defeated
deserted
and
practically
a
pauper
it
had
been
a
long
fight
but
the
city
had
conquered
a
few
more
attempts
at
work
a
few
more
appeals
for
fair
play
a
few
more
speeches
for
the
propaganda
but
as
baggage
in
jimmy
moohan
express
wagon
i
was
down
and
out
at
a
regular
meeting
of
the
trades
council
of
new
haven
a
member
moved
that
a
letter
of
sympathy
be
sent
to
me
a
week
after
my
fall
another
was
made
and
carried
to
make
me
a
member
of
the
council
and
a
third
to
send
me
a
check
for
fifty
dollars
this
was
the
only
money
i
ever
received
for
my
services
to
labour
and
as
it
arrived
a
few
hours
before
the
agent
called
for
his
rent
it
was
very
welcome
it
seemed
odd
to
all
sorts
of
people
that
after
being
starved
out
i
should
bob
up
again
in
one
of
the
largest
houses
on
chapel
street
i
could
quite
understand
it
myself
my
wife
could
however
she
said
the
whole
business
of
life
was
a
matter
of
mental
attitude
and
she
only
laughed
when
i
asked
whether
there
was
any
chance
of
my
being
kicked
to
death
by
a
mule
for
the
next
month
rent
i
made
another
attempt
to
interest
the
students
of
yale
in
the
human
affairs
of
new
haven
ten
years
previous
to
this
when
there
was
some
suggestion
that
i
take
charge
of
yale
mission
work
i
was
astounded
to
be
told
by
the
leaders
of
the
yale
that
the
chief
end
in
view
was
not
the
work
but
the
worker
yale
mission
was
to
give
the
student
practice
missions
were
to
be
laboratories
the
specimens
were
to
be
humans
the
eternal
questions
of
sin
and
poverty
were
to
be
answered
by
the
pious
phrases
and
the
junk
of
immature
students
i
gave
a
series
of
talks
on
labour
unions
to
a
selected
group
of
students
who
were
leaders
i
was
a
social
evangelist
then
and
after
the
talks
took
stock
of
the
results
many
fell
by
the
wayside
but
a
group
of
strong
men
formed
themselves
into
a
university
federal
labour
union
dick
morse
captain
of
the
crew
became
president
of
it
representative
union
constitutions
were
studied
the
following
sentences
from
the
declaration
of
principles
will
illustrate
how
thoroughly
these
young
men
got
in
line
with
the
union
movement
we
believe
it
inconsistent
and
unworthy
that
a
should
take
the
benefits
that
accrue
to
a
craft
as
a
direct
result
of
organization
and
at
the
same
time
hold
himself
aloof
from
the
responsibilities
and
from
his
share
of
the
expenses
of
that
organization
we
believe
that
union
men
whenever
possible
should
demand
the
union
label
as
a
guarantee
that
the
goods
were
manufactured
under
conditions
fair
to
labour
we
believe
that
eight
hours
should
constitute
a
work
in
the
preamble
was
this
statement
we
do
not
look
upon
the
labour
union
as
an
ultimate
conception
of
labour
but
we
believe
that
whatever
progress
has
been
made
in
the
lot
of
the
labourer
has
been
due
wholly
to
the
organization
of
the
the
preamble
concludes
with
this
paragraph
believing
therefore
in
the
cause
of
labour
and
desiring
to
add
according
to
our
ability
to
the
support
of
the
union
movement
we
pledge
ourselves
to
study
it
intelligently
and
to
support
it
loyally
here
was
the
beginning
of
a
splendid
mission
work
among
the
students
but
the
new
haven
labour
movement
was
big
enough
to
take
it
in
nor
was
the
american
federation
of
labour
the
labour
men
would
have
no
dealings
whatever
with
the
students
we
managed
to
keep
the
big
house
for
a
year
but
we
kept
little
else
during
that
period
twice
we
lost
the
mental
image
of
the
monthly
rent
sam
read
supplied
it
the
first
time
and
anson
phelps
stokes
the
other
these
were
my
only
borrowings
in
new
haven
in
that
house
i
had
one
of
the
most
bitter
experiences
of
my
life
i
think
said
my
wife
to
me
one
morning
at
that
the
baby
will
be
born
in
an
hour
the
announcement
chilled
me
there
was
but
five
cents
in
the
house
and
that
was
needed
to
telephone
for
the
family
physician
as
i
walked
down
chapel
street
it
seemed
as
if
my
heart
was
a
nest
of
scorpions
spitting
poison
there
was
no
breakfast
in
the
house
for
the
mother
of
the
babe
the
churches
the
homes
of
the
wealthy
and
the
university
filled
me
with
unutterable
hate
as
i
passed
them
i
was
in
the
frame
of
mind
in
which
murder
theft
violence
are
committed
i
had
held
my
integrity
intact
until
that
exigency
then
i
only
lacked
opportunity
to
smash
my
ideals
to
bend
my
head
my
back
my
morals
cold
sweat
covered
my
body
my
teeth
chattered
and
my
hands
twitched
my
socialist
philosophy
told
me
that
society
was
in
process
of
evolution
democracy
at
heart
was
correcting
its
own
evils
and
like
a
snake
sloughing
off
its
outworn
skin
i
was
part
of
that
process
reason
pounded
these
things
in
on
me
but
hate
pushed
them
aside
and
demanded
something
else
i
wondered
that
morning
whether
after
all
there
were
more
reforms
wrapped
up
in
a
stick
of
dynamite
than
in
a
whole
life
of
preaching
and
moralizing
in
that
walk
there
passed
through
my
mind
and
heart
all
the
elements
of
hell
it
was
a
new
experience
to
me
i
had
not
travelled
that
way
before
i
went
into
a
little
restaurant
to
use
the
i
laid
the
nickel
on
the
counter
when
i
had
finished
and
as
i
did
so
the
waiter
said
it
a
on
me
irvine
and
he
rang
up
five
cents
in
the
cash
register
ah
i
said
you
know
me
then
sure
thing
he
said
do
you
know
me
i
shook
my
head
gee
he
said
you
sick
you
look
like
hell
i
feel
like
it
what
up
you
heard
me
sure
aint
you
glad
yes
but
say
have
a
cup
of
hot
coffee
wo
you
thank
you
i
think
i
will
his
intuition
was
keen
enough
to
perceive
that
the
trouble
was
mental
and
as
i
took
the
coffee
he
said
discouraged
a
bit
hey
without
waiting
for
a
reply
he
proceeded
to
tell
me
how
a
few
words
of
mine
at
one
of
the
trolleymen
midnight
meetings
had
changed
his
life
he
went
into
details
and
as
he
went
on
i
saw
a
look
of
contentment
on
his
face
and
as
i
watched
it
changed
the
look
on
my
own
i
could
not
drink
his
coffee
but
i
shared
his
comradeship
and
as
i
went
back
home
i
became
normal
hate
left
my
heart
i
was
beaten
in
a
way
but
the
love
of
mankind
was
a
fundamental
thing
and
the
other
was
a
mental
storm
that
passed
over
and
left
no
ill
results
things
took
a
new
turn
that
morning
we
saw
a
rift
in
the
clouds
and
were
encouraged
it
became
clear
that
my
work
in
new
haven
was
ended
i
took
a
commission
from
the
young
men
christian
association
on
west
street
to
open
up
meetings
in
some
of
the
big
shops
and
factories
of
new
york
charles
powlison
who
is
one
of
the
largest
minded
and
noblest
hearted
men
in
the
association
is
special
secretary
there
and
it
was
through
his
faith
and
confidence
that
the
work
came
to
me
the
interborough
rapid
transit
company
gave
us
permission
to
hold
meetings
in
several
of
their
largest
shops
i
enjoyed
the
work
very
much
these
big
crowds
of
men
in
jumpers
and
overalls
had
a
fascination
for
me
the
work
in
the
interborough
went
well
for
a
year
i
reviewed
great
books
i
gave
the
biographies
of
the
world
greatest
men
i
talked
of
ethics
science
art
and
religion
i
taught
the
truth
as
i
understood
it
but
it
was
all
utterly
unsectarian
and
universal
in
one
shop
the
company
cleaned
out
the
junk
and
replaced
it
with
a
restaurant
the
superintendent
told
me
it
was
the
result
of
my
work
there
my
talks
were
never
over
fifteen
minutes
long
and
seldom
over
ten
i
was
always
assisted
by
a
musician
of
some
sort
the
work
went
well
for
a
year
in
the
big
shops
then
my
part
in
them
came
to
an
abrupt
end
the
board
of
directors
at
the
west
side
is
composed
of
representative
men
of
affairs
in
new
york
men
of
big
responsibilities
and
large
wealth
as
splendid
a
set
of
men
as
ever
governed
an
institution
this
particular
was
a
pioneer
institution
in
a
big
way
it
stood
for
large
things
when
those
things
were
unpopular
it
was
a
heretic
in
a
way
in
ten
years
the
procession
came
up
and
the
institution
seemed
to
stand
still
it
had
given
the
world
a
larger
outlook
in
religion
and
it
may
be
that
it
will
yet
become
a
pioneer
in
giving
it
a
larger
sociology
i
was
one
of
two
men
to
address
the
board
of
directors
one
night
and
i
stated
the
case
at
more
length
than
i
do
here
what
shall
i
tell
those
workingmen
you
stand
for
i
asked
do
you
believe
in
the
right
of
the
workers
to
organize
if
you
do
say
so
and
as
your
representative
let
me
tell
them
that
you
do
illustration
the
lunch
hour
in
an
interborough
shop
the
next
time
i
addressed
a
big
shop
meeting
i
gave
the
musician
all
the
minutes
save
three
several
hundreds
of
men
stood
around
me
disorganized
poorly
paid
men
men
i
said
there
is
in
this
city
a
thing
called
the
civic
federation
its
leaders
are
directly
the
owners
of
this
shop
in
it
are
also
leaders
of
labour
mitchell
and
gompers
there
are
several
bishops
of
various
beliefs
now
the
civic
federation
tells
us
tells
the
world
that
it
believes
in
labour
unions
what
i
want
to
suggest
is
this
a
dozen
of
you
get
together
write
a
note
to
your
masters
and
ask
them
if
that
belief
applies
to
of
course
i
knew
it
did
apply
to
them
but
i
got
very
tired
merely
telling
the
slaves
to
be
good
and
ended
my
service
there
in
that
way
a
spy
at
once
informed
the
superintendent
and
i
was
told
the
was
told
that
i
could
never
enter
their
shops
again
the
man
who
succeeded
me
as
a
speaker
at
that
shop
the
following
week
went
much
further
he
positively
advised
them
to
organize
for
hardly
in
the
united
states
could
one
find
greater
need
of
organization
chapter
xix
i
introduce
jack
london
to
yale
the
last
piece
of
work
in
new
haven
was
a
master
stroke
it
was
an
inoculation
jack
london
was
in
the
east
and
i
persuaded
him
to
pay
the
comrades
in
new
haven
a
visit
and
make
a
speech
the
theatres
were
all
engaged
so
were
the
halls
the
new
hall
could
not
be
rented
for
london
there
was
only
one
hope
left
yale
i
knew
a
student
who
was
a
socialist
we
outlined
a
plan
london
was
a
literary
man
yale
had
probably
heard
of
him
the
yale
union
was
canvassed
it
was
a
freshman
debating
society
certainly
they
had
read
london
books
the
call
of
the
wild
the
sea
wolf
etc
well
now
boys
here
your
chance
jack
london
can
be
had
for
a
lecture
the
union
had
no
money
and
woolsey
hall
cost
fifty
dollars
easy
i
suggested
though
i
did
have
fifty
cents
at
the
time
that
seemed
fine
of
course
i
said
as
i
remembered
the
empty
socialist
treasury
we
have
to
charge
an
admission
fee
of
ten
cents
that
too
was
all
right
in
case
of
frost
or
failure
i
promised
to
make
good
so
that
the
union
would
have
no
responsibility
i
meekly
suggested
that
as
compensation
for
risk
involved
i
would
take
the
surplus
if
there
was
any
they
say
jack
london
is
socialistically
inclined
doctor
said
the
youthful
president
of
the
yale
union
yes
he
is
rather
i
answered
well
he
added
i
suppose
we
will
have
to
take
our
chances
the
chances
seemed
small
then
they
loomed
up
larger
later
he
hoped
president
hadley
would
not
interfere
with
him
will
you
introduce
him
doctor
certainly
what
his
topic
he
calls
it
coming
crisis
social
i
suppose
eh
yes
it
a
suggested
remedy
for
a
lot
of
our
troubles
the
socialist
student
had
a
few
rounds
with
lee
mcclung
the
yale
treasurer
mac
did
know
irvine
from
a
but
took
billy
phelps
word
for
it
that
london
was
a
literary
man
and
let
it
go
at
that
let
the
hall
go
i
mean
yale
said
the
brilliant
phelps
is
a
university
and
not
a
monastery
besides
jack
london
is
one
of
the
most
distinguished
men
in
america
when
it
was
decided
we
could
have
the
hall
the
advertising
began
streets
shops
and
factories
were
bombarded
with
printed
announcements
next
morning
the
morning
after
securing
the
hall
yale
official
and
unofficial
awoke
to
find
tacked
to
every
tree
on
the
campus
the
inscription
jack
london
at
woolsey
hall
max
dellfant
painted
a
flaming
poster
that
gripped
men
by
the
eyes
in
it
london
appeared
in
a
red
sweater
and
in
the
background
the
lurid
glare
of
a
great
conflagration
yale
and
new
haven
had
never
been
so
thoroughly
informed
on
such
short
notice
the
information
was
in
red
letters
the
first
thing
done
was
to
run
down
the
officers
of
the
yale
union
they
had
previously
run
each
other
down
the
boys
were
thoroughly
scared
explanations
were
in
order
all
around
the
wiseacres
of
yale
got
busy
and
the
new
yale
took
a
hand
also
professor
charles
foster
kent
the
henry
drummond
of
yale
and
professor
william
lyon
phelps
counselled
a
square
deal
and
fair
play
the
yale
union
had
a
stormy
meeting
a
real
sensation
was
on
their
hands
there
was
possible
censure
and
probable
glory
and
every
man
in
the
union
went
after
his
share
it
was
indignantly
moved
and
carried
that
the
president
of
the
union
introduce
the
speaker
irvine
is
a
socialist
the
mover
said
and
would
spoil
the
show
before
it
began
illustration
alexander
irvine
and
jack
london
they
next
discussed
the
topic
one
boy
suggested
that
london
be
asked
to
cut
out
all
mention
of
socialism
that
was
tabooed
because
no
one
knew
that
he
would
mention
it
anyway
the
day
of
the
lecture
i
got
this
note
from
the
socialist
student
yale
union
and
many
of
the
faculty
are
sweating
under
the
collar
for
fear
london
say
something
socialistic
the
union
realizes
that
it
would
be
absolutely
useless
to
ask
him
to
smooth
over
his
lecture
and
cut
out
anything
which
sounds
radical
also
they
have
decided
that
it
would
be
a
shock
to
the
university
and
the
public
to
have
appear
upon
the
platform
in
any
way
shape
or
manner
they
are
going
to
ask
you
to
cancel
your
engagement
to
introduce
london
in
this
i
think
they
are
unwise
but
as
they
are
determined
it
must
be
so
i
advise
you
to
agree
to
whatever
arrangement
they
suggest
this
done
they
will
the
chances
that
london
will
express
socialistic
ideas
now
i
fear
there
will
be
the
devil
to
pay
for
the
lecture
the
university
is
going
to
be
surprised
the
faculty
shocked
beyond
measure
and
the
yale
union
severely
criticized
this
is
how
the
president
of
the
union
expressed
the
situation
in
a
note
to
me
on
the
day
of
the
lecture
at
a
meeting
of
the
executive
committee
of
the
yale
union
it
was
voted
that
the
president
of
the
union
introduce
the
speaker
of
the
evening
as
it
would
tend
to
identify
the
union
more
conspicuously
and
also
to
give
it
prominence
before
the
student
body
for
this
reason
wholly
beyond
my
power
and
opposed
to
my
opinion
i
shall
be
forced
to
forego
our
little
plan
which
i
thought
by
far
the
best
etc
some
small
portion
of
prosperity
having
come
our
way
i
was
able
to
dine
a
small
group
with
jack
london
as
the
chief
guest
professor
charles
foster
kent
of
yale
and
charles
de
forrest
a
business
man
were
among
the
guests
it
was
a
socialist
innings
at
woolsey
hall
that
night
the
big
crowd
gave
the
yale
union
an
idea
this
time
it
was
a
financial
idea
hundred
people
paid
admission
the
officers
swept
down
on
the
box
office
but
there
was
a
socialist
inside
playing
capitalist
socialists
are
not
familiar
enough
with
the
game
to
play
it
successfully
but
in
this
instance
we
played
in
strict
accordance
with
the
rules
we
furnished
the
capital
took
the
risks
and
bagged
the
pot
we
conceded
nine
points
out
of
ten
the
tenth
was
a
financial
one
the
audience
represented
every
phase
of
life
in
the
city
over
a
hundred
of
the
faculty
and
ten
times
as
many
students
citizens
of
all
classes
were
there
the
harvard
students
had
played
horse
with
london
a
few
weeks
before
this
and
we
the
socialists
were
prepared
for
any
sort
of
demonstration
the
spectacle
of
an
avowed
socialist
said
the
new
haven
one
of
the
most
conspicious
in
the
country
standing
upon
the
platform
of
woolsey
hall
and
boldly
advocating
the
doctrines
of
revolution
was
a
sight
for
gods
and
men
jack
london
talked
for
over
two
hours
to
that
packed
hall
and
received
a
most
unusual
attention
after
the
lecture
he
was
taken
to
a
students
dormitory
where
he
answered
questions
till
midnight
then
he
was
escorted
by
a
smaller
group
to
mory
for
supper
and
at
one
we
held
a
reception
at
the
big
house
which
was
known
as
the
socialist
parsonage
for
over
twenty
years
i
have
been
a
contributor
to
newspapers
and
religious
periodicals
but
not
until
i
met
jack
london
did
it
ever
occur
to
me
that
i
could
earn
a
living
by
my
pen
london
made
me
promise
to
write
my
first
story
i
mailed
to
california
for
his
criticism
and
suggestion
but
before
it
returned
i
had
entered
the
field
chapter
xx
my
experience
as
a
labourer
in
the
muscle
market
of
the
south
published
my
first
serious
attempt
at
fiction
it
was
a
short
story
entitled
two
social
pariahs
the
cry
of
peonage
was
in
the
air
and
i
arranged
with
for
a
series
of
articles
on
the
subject
dressed
as
a
labourer
i
went
to
the
muscle
market
of
new
york
and
got
hired
to
do
this
i
had
to
assume
a
foreign
accent
and
look
as
slovenly
as
possible
with
a
picturesque
contingent
of
hungarians
finns
swedes
and
greeks
i
was
drafted
for
the
iron
mines
of
the
tennessee
coal
and
iron
company
the
mines
are
near
bessemer
at
every
turn
of
the
road
south
we
were
herded
and
handled
like
cattle
it
was
a
big
black
porter
who
led
us
into
the
car
at
portsmouth
va
i
was
the
leader
of
the
contingent
and
the
porter
addressed
us
for
the
most
part
by
signs
and
when
he
spoke
at
all
he
called
me
johnny
when
inside
he
arranged
us
in
our
seats
putting
his
hands
on
some
of
our
shoulders
to
press
us
down
into
them
i
did
not
realize
that
i
was
in
a
southern
state
until
i
saw
a
big
yellow
card
in
this
car
marked
coloured
then
i
knew
instantly
that
we
were
in
a
jim
crow
car
a
coloured
woman
sat
next
to
the
window
in
my
seat
and
by
her
look
and
little
toss
of
the
head
and
a
quick
nervous
movement
she
seemed
to
say
what
are
you
doing
here
when
the
train
pulled
out
of
the
depot
i
stepped
up
to
the
porter
and
said
have
you
a
law
in
virginia
on
the
separation
of
the
races
the
big
black
fellow
grinned
dere
sho
is
boss
but
you
ai
no
races
you
is
jest
dagoes
you
at
atlanta
we
changed
cars
and
were
again
driven
into
the
jim
crow
car
this
time
i
made
a
more
intelligent
attempt
to
solve
my
race
problem
the
conductor
faultlessly
dressed
in
broadcloth
and
covered
with
gold
lace
strode
into
our
car
with
the
air
of
an
admiral
of
the
fleet
he
went
straight
through
the
car
collecting
the
block
ticket
for
our
gang
from
the
boss
and
as
he
returned
i
stepped
into
the
aisle
in
front
of
him
blocking
his
passage
pardon
me
sir
i
said
is
there
a
law
in
georgia
on
the
separation
of
the
races
without
a
word
he
removed
the
glasses
from
his
nose
stared
at
me
for
a
moment
then
turned
sharply
walked
to
the
end
of
the
car
removed
the
card
which
read
coloured
and
reversed
it
it
then
read
white
then
he
came
back
through
the
car
slowly
staring
at
me
as
he
passed
but
without
uttering
a
word
our
particular
destination
was
muckers
camp
at
readers
a
group
of
three
buildings
on
the
brow
of
a
hill
the
hill
where
the
blacks
live
the
first
of
these
buildings
is
a
kitchen
and
dining
room
the
second
is
a
big
dormitory
and
the
third
is
a
this
was
our
new
home
the
dormitory
was
originally
intended
for
a
series
of
small
rooms
but
the
work
was
arrested
before
completion
the
uprights
marking
the
divisions
of
the
rooms
were
still
standing
bare
and
uncovered
the
floor
of
the
big
dormitory
was
littered
with
rubbish
miners
clothing
shoes
broken
lamps
and
in
a
corner
there
was
a
of
broken
bedsteads
slats
army
blankets
and
sodden
mattresses
we
were
told
to
make
ourselves
at
home
there
was
room
enough
and
plenty
of
bedding
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
fish
for
what
we
needed
and
put
it
in
order
everything
was
red
red
with
ore
that
men
carried
out
of
the
mines
on
their
bodies
the
junk
heap
in
the
corner
played
an
important
part
in
the
movements
of
my
gang
the
thought
of
having
to
sleep
in
the
sodden
stuff
chilled
me
to
the
bones
but
i
kept
silent
whatever
the
previous
condition
of
the
men
had
been
they
felt
as
i
did
as
they
pulled
their
bedding
out
piece
by
piece
they
had
gone
to
spend
the
winter
in
the
mines
of
the
tennessee
coal
and
iron
company
they
knew
the
work
conditions
and
pay
they
had
refused
to
be
bribed
on
the
way
down
but
as
they
tugged
at
the
junk
a
change
came
over
them
they
swore
in
half
a
dozen
languages
they
gritted
their
teeth
and
vowed
that
they
be
treated
like
pigs
illustration
in
a
mucker
camp
in
alabama
illustration
irvine
and
three
other
muckers
as
they
left
greenwich
street
for
the
south
we
went
to
the
and
the
outlook
was
less
encouraging
there
was
a
long
narrow
trough
in
the
centre
it
was
half
full
of
red
ore
the
floor
was
wet
and
covered
with
ore
rags
old
papers
and
other
rubbish
there
were
compartments
intended
for
but
there
again
the
work
had
been
arrested
and
was
incomplete
we
washed
made
our
beds
ate
dinner
and
proceeded
to
the
company
store
to
be
fitted
out
each
man
was
furnished
with
a
number
by
that
number
he
was
to
be
known
while
in
the
company
employ
each
man
showed
his
number
and
drew
what
he
needed
overalls
lamps
and
heavy
boots
there
was
nothing
niggardly
in
the
credit
the
deeper
the
debt
the
tighter
the
grip
on
the
debtor
the
goods
cost
just
one
hundred
per
cent
more
than
anywhere
else
the
company
paid
wages
once
a
month
if
a
labourer
borrowed
of
his
own
within
that
time
he
paid
ten
per
cent
on
the
loan
as
we
came
back
from
the
store
the
miners
were
just
leaving
the
mines
and
it
was
interesting
to
see
them
gaze
into
our
faces
and
address
us
in
russian
hungarian
swedish
and
various
other
languages
it
was
one
of
the
excitements
of
camp
life
to
inspect
and
classify
the
newcomers
one
of
the
men
had
a
wheezy
accordion
and
he
relieved
the
monotony
of
the
evening
with
some
german
airs
the
big
shed
was
unlighted
save
as
each
man
was
his
own
each
made
his
own
bed
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
on
his
cap
as
he
undressed
the
cap
was
the
last
article
to
be
set
aside
and
the
extinguishing
of
the
smoky
flickering
blaze
the
last
act
of
the
night
as
the
first
streak
of
the
gray
dawn
came
in
through
the
bare
windows
four
of
our
gang
dressed
and
deliberately
marched
out
of
the
camp
never
to
return
the
first
number
in
the
programme
of
a
mucker
toilet
is
to
adjust
his
cap
with
his
lamp
in
it
trimmed
and
burning
the
second
is
to
light
his
pipe
then
he
dresses
it
was
five
and
still
dark
when
those
nude
shaggy
men
with
heads
ablaze
with
smoky
flickering
lamps
began
to
move
around
they
looked
grotesque
unearthly
denizens
of
some
underground
pit
they
were
and
full
of
boisterous
laughter
a
breakfast
of
pork
beans
potatoes
bread
and
coffee
plenty
of
each
and
we
went
off
with
dinner
pails
over
the
hill
to
the
valley
where
five
tall
smoking
chimneys
marked
the
entrances
to
as
many
mines
each
mine
has
a
complete
outfit
of
men
and
machinery
and
a
certain
number
of
chambers
or
pockets
in
which
with
blast
and
hammer
and
hand
the
red
hills
are
made
to
disgorge
their
treasures
of
iron
three
of
us
perched
ourselves
on
the
rear
end
of
the
skip
a
big
disgorger
and
began
the
descent
it
was
a
per
cent
grade
and
the
skip
at
the
end
of
a
powerful
wire
cable
went
down
by
jerks
one
of
my
companions
was
franz
the
hungarian
the
other
was
a
german
the
big
square
mouth
of
the
mine
became
smaller
and
smaller
as
we
bumped
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
in
a
few
minutes
it
looked
like
a
small
and
then
disappeared
altogether
and
we
were
left
in
the
darkness
each
mine
is
like
a
little
town
it
has
a
main
street
and
side
alleys
pockets
they
are
called
there
are
live
and
dead
pockets
the
dead
are
the
worked
out
at
the
first
of
the
live
pockets
the
skip
was
stopped
by
some
invisible
hand
and
we
clambered
over
the
side
to
a
platform
where
a
foreman
met
and
conducted
us
to
the
task
of
the
day
the
mine
was
filled
with
red
dust
we
could
see
but
a
few
feet
ahead
of
us
the
lamps
on
men
brows
looked
like
dancing
in
the
red
mist
there
was
a
sound
of
rushing
water
and
the
of
the
pumps
as
we
waded
through
a
water
alley
we
heard
the
warning
yells
of
a
foreman
a
charge
of
dynamite
was
about
to
burst
and
the
men
were
flying
out
of
danger
we
were
whisked
into
a
cleft
for
safety
half
a
dozen
old
miners
were
squeezed
in
beside
us
our
scarcely
soiled
caps
told
the
story
of
our
newness
and
the
old
hands
watched
us
closely
boom
the
hills
shivered
like
the
deck
of
a
warship
as
she
discharges
a
broadside
franz
shivered
too
his
eyes
bulged
and
he
stared
at
the
men
around
us
who
laughed
at
his
fright
the
explosion
was
in
our
alley
it
had
torn
up
the
like
strips
of
macaroni
it
was
the
salute
of
dynamite
to
our
soft
flabby
muscles
to
our
white
caps
and
new
overalls
it
was
a
stick
of
concentrated
power
throwing
down
the
gauntlet
to
men
in
the
raw
we
had
a
foreman
who
superintended
our
compartment
a
driller
who
with
a
steam
drill
sat
all
day
boring
holes
for
dynamite
and
we
were
the
muckers
miner
helpers
who
carried
away
with
muscular
power
the
effects
of
the
explosion
each
alley
had
similar
crews
mule
boy
i
roared
with
all
my
vocal
power
into
what
looked
like
an
ugly
rent
in
the
rocks
a
moment
later
i
saw
a
glimmer
of
light
then
a
mule
shot
up
out
of
a
hole
and
a
black
boy
brought
up
the
rear
clinging
to
the
tail
of
emma
the
mule
our
locomotive
we
were
handed
a
huge
each
and
the
work
began
my
hammer
bounded
off
the
rocks
as
if
it
were
an
air
ball
it
bounded
for
a
dozen
heavy
strokes
turn
that
rock
over
and
look
for
the
grain
the
foreman
shouted
in
my
ear
then
he
took
the
hammer
turned
the
huge
boulder
over
on
its
side
struck
it
twice
or
thrice
and
it
flew
into
splinters
we
acquired
the
knack
of
things
quickly
and
instinctively
struck
the
working
pace
it
was
the
limit
of
human
strength
and
endurance
my
jacket
came
off
first
then
my
overalls
then
my
shirt
leaving
trousers
and
undershirt
only
the
others
followed
suit
the
sweat
oozed
out
of
every
pore
of
my
body
we
smashed
filled
and
ran
out
the
full
cars
we
worked
silently
doggedly
and
at
top
speed
several
hundred
men
were
doing
likewise
in
other
pockets
they
were
less
bloody
perhaps
but
the
work
was
the
same
and
they
did
it
without
knowing
that
it
was
brutally
hard
there
was
a
halt
of
fifteen
minutes
for
dinner
then
we
went
at
it
again
our
best
fell
short
of
the
demand
for
every
car
of
ore
blasted
the
foreman
got
fifty
cents
and
for
running
out
each
car
we
got
twenty
cents
a
little
over
six
cents
your
souls
to
h
l
the
foreman
shouted
why
do
you
get
a
move
on
you
hey
we
moved
a
little
faster
you
muckers
ai
goin
t
get
ten
cars
out
if
ye
do
mend
yer
licks
we
mended
our
licks
he
looked
like
a
wild
beast
short
of
stature
but
his
arms
were
hardened
and
under
the
red
skin
the
muscles
were
hard
as
and
taut
as
a
drum
his
eyebrows
were
heavy
and
bushy
and
over
his
strong
chest
grew
shaggy
masses
of
black
hair
our
car
slipped
the
track
once
and
when
he
heard
the
smash
he
came
thundering
along
ripping
out
a
string
of
oaths
as
he
came
putting
his
powerful
body
to
the
lever
he
lifted
the
car
almost
alone
as
he
did
so
his
lamp
came
in
contact
with
my
hand
unable
to
let
go
i
screamed
to
him
to
move
as
he
did
so
he
saw
the
seared
flesh
too
bad
too
bad
he
said
as
he
dropped
the
truck
i
gazed
into
his
eyes
look
here
i
said
if
you
will
look
as
human
as
that
again
you
may
burn
the
other
hand
the
human
moles
who
empty
these
pockets
of
ore
are
inured
life
down
there
is
normal
to
them
after
a
few
years
work
the
skin
becomes
calloused
and
tough
the
hands
become
claws
or
talons
broken
and
disfigured
the
muckers
laughed
at
us
they
saw
we
were
concerned
about
trifles
bloody
sweat
and
hot
oil
held
the
red
dust
around
us
like
a
garment
our
scanty
clothing
was
glued
to
our
bodies
our
shoes
were
filled
with
water
but
that
was
a
luxury
it
was
cool
what
a
hades
of
noise
and
dust
the
continual
noise
and
clatter
of
the
pumps
the
rattle
of
the
drillers
the
hissing
of
steam
and
the
roar
of
the
dynamite
explosions
are
matters
that
one
gets
accustomed
to
in
time
the
frenzied
desire
to
get
cars
filled
and
run
out
leaves
little
time
for
novel
sensations
for
that
brute
force
is
needed
at
the
end
of
the
first
day
we
had
filled
and
run
out
ten
cars
our
pay
for
that
was
cents
apiece
during
the
same
time
philo
the
mule
boy
made
cents
and
emma
she
had
earned
what
would
enable
her
to
return
to
repeat
the
work
of
about
five
in
the
afternoon
we
were
sandwiched
into
the
big
iron
skip
with
a
score
of
others
black
and
white
eight
hours
had
taken
our
newness
away
we
were
as
others
in
colour
and
condition
we
looked
into
their
faces
and
felt
their
hot
breath
then
a
signal
was
given
and
the
panting
squirming
mass
was
jerked
to
the
surface
as
we
passed
over
the
hill
to
the
camp
i
was
in
an
ecstasy
the
sense
of
relief
under
the
open
sky
was
intense
others
seemed
to
have
it
for
they
joked
and
laughed
boisterously
over
trifles
as
we
went
home
seven
of
us
together
went
to
the
big
it
was
rather
crowded
i
marvelled
that
nobody
was
using
the
i
soaped
myself
stood
beneath
the
big
iron
and
waited
but
there
was
no
response
there
was
a
loud
laugh
then
a
miner
asked
air
ye
posin
for
yer
photo
mister
no
what
the
matter
with
the
water
fits
buttie
it
got
fits
there
was
plenty
of
food
of
a
kind
the
supper
at
the
close
of
the
day
was
a
brief
function
but
brutal
as
it
was
brief
it
was
something
of
a
shock
the
first
night
we
were
in
camp
but
at
the
close
of
my
first
day
work
i
found
myself
on
a
level
with
the
grossest
the
finer
instincts
were
blunted
or
gone
and
i
was
in
the
clutch
of
a
hunger
like
that
of
the
jungle
where
might
and
cunning
rule
at
a
signal
from
the
cook
we
rushed
in
crushed
by
main
force
into
a
seat
seized
whatever
was
nearest
and
began
scarcely
a
word
was
spoken
heads
down
hands
and
jaws
at
top
speed
the
disgusting
spectacle
lasted
but
a
few
minutes
then
up
and
out
to
smoke
and
talk
beside
me
sat
a
strong
powerfully
built
german
boy
who
joked
about
the
age
of
the
pork
for
supper
what
you
guff
about
the
burly
steward
asked
schmell
py
gee
its
tick
mit
bad
schmell
vell
you
shut
your
maut
or
i
smash
your
head
see
the
boy
laughed
then
the
steward
removed
his
plate
and
refused
to
give
any
more
nobody
took
any
notice
we
were
too
busy
and
too
brutally
selfish
to
interfere
the
steward
was
the
camp
bully
and
the
men
were
afraid
of
him
they
must
not
even
laugh
at
his
provisions
we
had
pork
for
breakfast
we
took
pork
chops
to
the
mines
for
dinner
and
the
staple
article
the
standby
of
every
supper
was
pork
pigs
in
alabama
are
like
turnips
in
scotland
there
are
no
property
rights
in
them
they
breed
and
litter
in
the
tall
they
root
around
the
shanties
and
cover
the
landscape
who
owns
these
pigs
i
asked
old
ransom
pope
a
negro
one
an
anoder
he
said
the
gullies
and
the
weeds
were
full
of
them
and
the
steward
found
them
easy
and
cheap
feeding
you
come
yere
for
breakfast
an
i
smash
your
dam
head
the
steward
said
to
the
boy
as
we
left
the
dining
room
there
was
no
reply
each
man
went
his
way
they
were
tired
too
tired
to
think
though
a
stranger
to
even
the
taste
of
liquor
i
had
an
intense
craving
for
it
and
it
seemed
as
if
i
had
used
it
all
my
life
an
hour
after
supper
i
lay
down
on
my
sodden
pile
and
went
to
sleep
i
was
awakened
next
morning
by
a
norwegian
mucker
who
was
organizing
a
strike
over
the
incident
of
the
tainted
pork
five
minutes
later
every
man
in
the
shed
was
around
the
stove
in
an
impromptu
indignation
meeting
it
was
agreed
that
max
the
german
boy
should
go
in
first
if
the
steward
put
him
out
we
were
all
to
leave
with
him
and
refuse
to
work
he
was
allowed
to
take
breakfast
but
was
refused
a
dinner
pail
we
dropped
ours
and
marched
to
the
office
in
a
body
an
investigation
was
made
and
it
was
discovered
that
the
steward
was
feeding
us
on
his
neighbour
pork
and
charging
it
to
the
company
he
was
discharged
and
we
went
back
to
the
camp
to
make
merry
for
the
rest
of
the
forenoon
the
fun
for
most
of
them
consisted
of
an
extra
demand
on
their
physical
force
rough
and
wrestling
one
man
went
to
town
for
extra
stimulants
another
a
big
swede
stripped
nude
drained
at
a
single
draught
a
bottle
of
whiskey
and
lay
down
to
sleep
himself
drunk
and
sober
again
before
his
next
call
to
the
pits
at
the
close
of
the
day
he
lay
there
a
big
shaggy
animal
wallowing
the
mines
were
shut
down
on
sunday
and
we
had
an
opportunity
to
look
around
though
a
place
of
one
thousand
inhabitants
it
has
no
there
are
ditches
but
no
drains
wide
deep
gullies
but
no
streets
the
moon
shines
there
in
her
season
but
there
are
no
street
lamps
the
hogs
are
somewhat
tame
and
we
fed
them
as
we
went
along
there
is
a
church
but
it
for
black
folks
it
essential
to
them
the
whites
fare
not
so
well
if
they
want
one
they
travel
for
it
they
do
likewise
for
a
school
for
the
little
school
beside
the
church
is
for
coloured
children
the
only
modern
convenience
was
an
ancient
style
of
hydrant
around
which
the
children
were
organizing
fire
companies
and
extinguishing
imaginary
fires
after
visiting
the
mule
boy
in
rat
hollow
on
sunday
i
returned
to
the
camp
the
men
were
lounging
around
the
stove
smoking
and
exchanging
experiences
in
one
corner
a
german
sailor
was
playing
his
wheezy
accordion
and
in
another
to
a
group
of
slavs
a
russian
soldier
was
singing
a
love
song
it
was
my
last
day
with
the
muckers
many
of
my
gang
had
already
gone
the
rest
would
follow
it
was
a
matter
of
wages
or
hours
it
was
a
question
of
muck
once
in
it
men
lived
moved
and
had
their
being
in
it
but
even
the
most
brutalized
quailed
at
the
junk
pile
in
the
corner
of
the
shed
the
sun
was
setting
behind
the
red
hills
save
for
a
long
yellow
streak
just
above
the
horizon
the
sky
was
a
mass
of
purple
billows
the
yellow
changed
to
amber
and
later
to
a
blood
red
then
rays
of
shot
up
and
splashed
the
purple
billows
the
purple
and
gold
later
gave
place
to
black
clouds
through
which
the
stars
came
one
by
one
while
the
muckers
were
settling
down
for
the
night
it
seemed
at
first
as
if
i
would
have
to
commit
some
crime
to
get
admission
to
the
stockade
where
the
tennessee
coal
and
iron
company
had
their
largest
convict
labour
force
i
was
my
beard
had
grown
and
i
was
still
in
blue
shirt
and
overalls
i
approached
the
chaplain
told
him
my
story
and
gained
admission
to
his
night
school
and
for
three
weeks
moved
in
and
out
among
the
socially
damned
of
that
horrible
stockade
in
that
time
i
got
the
facts
of
the
life
there
and
i
became
so
depressed
by
what
i
saw
that
i
had
to
fight
daily
to
keep
off
a
sense
of
hate
that
pressed
in
upon
me
every
time
i
went
into
that
atmosphere
here
were
eight
hundred
men
seven
hundred
of
them
coloured
they
had
committed
crimes
against
persons
and
property
the
state
of
alabama
hired
them
out
to
the
corporation
at
so
much
a
head
and
the
corporation
proceeded
with
state
aid
to
make
their
investment
pay
the
men
were
underfed
and
overworked
and
in
addition
were
exploited
in
the
most
shameful
manner
by
officials
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
for
the
slightest
infraction
of
the
rules
they
were
flogged
like
galley
slaves
women
were
flogged
as
well
as
men
what
the
lash
and
the
labour
left
undone
tuberculosis
finished
unsanitary
conditions
rotten
sheds
sent
many
of
them
into
eternity
where
they
were
better
off
they
were
classified
according
to
their
ability
to
dig
coal
not
according
to
the
crimes
committed
from
the
stockade
i
went
to
a
lumber
camp
where
some
officials
had
been
found
guilty
of
peonage
illustration
irvine
punching
logs
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
i
got
a
job
as
a
teamster
and
took
my
place
in
the
camp
among
the
labourers
as
if
i
had
spent
my
life
at
it
in
this
way
i
got
at
the
facts
of
how
and
why
men
had
been
decoyed
from
new
york
and
imprisoned
in
the
forests
i
was
so
much
at
home
in
my
work
and
so
disguised
that
no
one
ever
for
a
moment
suspected
me
i
obtained
photographs
of
the
bosses
the
bloodhounds
and
the
camp
box
cars
in
which
the
lumber
jacks
lived
several
times
around
a
bonfire
of
pine
knots
i
entertained
the
men
of
the
camp
with
stories
of
travel
history
and
romance
if
i
had
been
discovered
if
the
purpose
of
my
presence
had
been
known
i
would
have
been
shot
like
a
dog
for
life
is
as
cheap
in
a
southern
lumber
field
as
in
any
part
of
the
world
from
the
lumber
camp
i
went
to
one
of
the
big
turpentine
camps
where
conditions
are
as
primitive
and
as
inhuman
as
in
the
stockades
my
next
and
last
job
in
the
south
was
punching
logs
in
pensacola
harbour
for
a
dollar
and
six
bits
a
day
there
i
got
material
for
several
stories
of
peons
who
had
escaped
from
the
woods
while
in
pensacola
i
made
a
visit
one
sunday
morning
to
the
city
jail
and
asked
permission
to
address
the
prisoners
the
jailer
of
course
wanted
to
know
what
an
unkempt
labourer
had
to
say
to
his
charges
in
order
to
convince
him
i
had
to
deliver
an
exegesis
before
the
desk
the
cells
were
iron
cages
with
stone
floors
a
young
englishman
who
had
just
landed
after
a
long
sea
voyage
the
night
before
was
the
first
man
to
whom
i
talked
he
claimed
to
have
been
drugged
and
robbed
in
a
saloon
the
fact
of
his
incarceration
was
a
small
thing
to
him
what
made
him
swear
was
the
condition
of
his
cage
the
excrements
of
probably
half
a
dozen
of
his
predecessors
in
the
cell
lay
around
him
nauseating
and
suffocating
him
fire
shot
from
his
eyes
as
he
pointed
to
it
he
was
bitter
sarcastic
sneering
and
with
evident
and
abundant
cause
whatever
i
had
to
say
to
the
men
and
women
in
that
dungeon
that
morning
was
driven
from
my
mind
and
my
lips
the
young
man
pushed
all
the
resentment
of
his
soul
over
into
mine
i
spent
that
sunday
in
working
out
a
plan
by
which
i
could
help
pensacola
to
clean
up
this
social
ulcer
there
was
a
tourist
club
there
and
i
offered
to
lecture
for
them
it
was
arranged
for
the
following
sunday
afternoon
i
called
on
the
mayor
and
he
promised
to
preside
i
interviewed
several
aldermen
and
they
promised
to
attend
i
lectured
for
forty
minutes
on
my
experiences
as
a
labourer
in
the
camps
of
the
south
and
for
ten
minutes
at
the
close
described
what
i
had
seen
in
the
city
jail
it
was
a
somewhat
heroic
method
of
treatment
and
i
did
not
remain
long
enough
to
see
the
effect
but
i
at
least
deprived
them
of
the
plea
of
ignorance
i
found
in
florida
two
government
officials
who
had
done
splendid
work
in
behalf
of
labour
i
mean
the
labourers
who
were
decoyed
by
false
promises
and
brutally
abused
on
their
arrival
in
the
camps
they
were
both
modest
men
men
unlikely
to
enter
politics
for
personal
advancement
i
cut
my
articles
out
of
the
magazine
and
sent
them
to
president
roosevelt
calling
his
attention
to
the
conditions
and
commending
these
men
to
his
notice
the
result
was
that
they
were
both
promoted
to
positions
where
their
usefulness
was
increased
and
the
cause
of
labour
considerably
helped
chapter
xxi
at
the
church
of
the
ascension
a
group
of
literary
people
with
whom
i
was
acquainted
had
rented
no
fifth
avenue
and
were
operating
a
coöperative
housekeeping
scheme
i
became
part
of
the
plan
and
it
was
there
that
i
first
met
the
rector
of
the
church
of
the
ascension
the
rev
percy
stickney
grant
naturally
we
talked
of
the
church
and
its
work
i
was
so
impressed
with
grant
bigness
that
i
volunteered
to
devote
some
of
my
spare
time
to
the
work
of
his
parish
a
few
weeks
later
i
got
a
letter
from
him
inviting
me
to
become
a
member
of
his
staff
this
was
a
surprise
to
me
but
i
made
no
immediate
decision
i
was
earning
a
comfortable
living
and
devoting
my
spare
time
to
the
socialist
propaganda
i
was
very
free
and
i
saw
danger
ahead
in
church
work
i
had
several
interviews
with
grant
and
went
over
the
situation
i
was
a
man
with
socialistic
tendencies
i
was
a
socialist
a
member
of
the
party
the
danger
ahead
looked
smaller
to
grant
than
it
did
to
me
he
had
absolute
confidence
in
the
men
of
affairs
around
him
my
socialism
was
explained
and
understood
just
how
to
fit
in
was
the
next
problem
the
mission
of
the
church
is
at
no
horatio
street
it
was
without
a
minister
in
charge
for
a
few
sunday
evenings
i
conducted
the
service
the
audience
was
composed
of
half
a
dozen
parishoners
and
a
dozen
of
my
personal
friends
grant
knew
nothing
of
my
ability
in
public
address
i
took
his
place
one
night
in
the
church
and
that
ended
my
career
at
the
chapel
i
had
discarded
an
ecclesiastical
title
i
possessed
but
never
used
i
became
a
lay
reader
in
the
episcopal
church
the
church
of
my
youth
the
church
in
which
i
was
baptized
and
confirmed
the
conference
and
discussion
following
the
service
was
an
afterthought
the
audiences
steadily
grew
it
was
and
is
the
most
cosmopolitan
audience
i
ever
saw
i
wanted
to
get
acquainted
with
the
people
and
suggested
a
sort
of
reception
in
the
chapel
the
ladies
of
the
church
provided
refreshments
who
is
that
man
one
of
the
ladies
at
the
tea
table
asked
one
night
he
is
a
socialist
agitator
i
answered
why
do
you
ask
him
to
talk
the
man
was
sol
fieldman
and
i
asked
him
to
speak
for
five
minutes
he
did
so
and
from
that
time
the
character
of
the
changed
the
first
few
evenings
after
the
change
the
speaking
was
very
informal
any
one
of
note
who
happened
to
be
in
the
meeting
was
asked
to
speak
later
the
invitation
was
enlarged
and
any
one
who
desired
to
speak
could
do
so
then
came
a
time
limit
a
workingman
asked
that
the
refreshments
be
cut
out
the
table
took
up
valuable
space
and
the
time
consumed
in
serving
was
a
pure
waste
so
he
said
then
we
arranged
for
a
formal
presentation
of
a
topic
and
a
discussion
to
follow
it
the
socialists
were
always
in
the
majority
every
socialist
is
a
propagandist
not
always
an
intelligent
propagandist
intelligent
and
leading
socialists
are
generally
engaged
sunday
evenings
so
the
majority
of
those
who
came
to
us
were
of
the
kind
limited
very
limited
in
the
literary
expression
of
the
social
soul
flame
that
so
passionately
moves
them
some
of
our
church
officers
who
took
an
active
part
in
the
first
year
meetings
were
somewhat
alarmed
at
the
brusqueness
of
these
men
and
women
and
undertook
to
correct
their
manners
the
rector
understood
and
with
great
patience
and
tact
he
heard
all
the
church
of
the
ascension
has
in
its
membership
some
of
the
country
biggest
leaders
in
industry
some
of
these
men
came
to
the
meetings
what
they
saw
and
heard
was
different
to
what
they
expected
they
fraternized
with
the
men
of
toil
it
was
a
fraternity
utterly
devoid
of
patronage
there
were
free
exchanges
of
thought
the
average
labouring
man
is
incapable
of
such
conference
for
no
matter
how
many
years
a
member
of
a
labour
union
it
is
only
when
he
becomes
a
socialist
that
he
becomes
an
intelligent
advocate
of
anything
illustration
the
church
of
the
ascension
the
rector
and
i
tried
to
avoid
the
notice
of
the
newspapers
and
for
about
six
months
we
succeeded
then
came
the
explosion
of
the
bomb
on
union
square
and
we
were
at
once
thrown
into
the
limelight
i
was
on
the
square
that
afternoon
it
was
designed
to
be
a
mass
meeting
of
the
unemployed
the
unemployed
are
not
usually
interested
in
any
sort
of
propaganda
the
more
intelligent
of
the
labour
men
are
and
the
socialists
are
more
so
so
the
promoters
of
the
mass
meeting
for
the
unemployed
were
socialists
it
was
at
this
meeting
that
a
police
official
declared
to
a
man
who
had
the
temerity
to
question
him
that
the
policeman
club
was
mightier
than
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
no
permit
was
given
and
no
mass
meeting
held
but
the
multitude
was
there
and
when
the
police
began
to
disperse
it
the
people
who
were
neither
socialists
nor
unemployed
resented
being
driven
off
the
streets
i
saw
men
clubbed
and
women
deliberately
ridden
over
by
the
mounted
police
i
kept
moving
i
wanted
to
be
where
it
was
most
dangerous
i
suffered
for
months
with
a
bruised
arm
that
i
got
as
i
went
with
the
crowd
in
front
of
the
horses
it
was
a
blow
aimed
at
a
man
head
i
was
clubbed
on
the
back
for
not
moving
fast
enough
at
every
turn
at
every
angle
of
the
square
the
police
were
as
brutal
as
any
cossack
that
ever
wielded
a
knout
late
on
that
afternoon
the
police
opened
the
square
that
is
the
people
were
permitted
to
cross
it
in
all
directions
my
study
was
at
no
fifth
avenue
and
i
was
moving
in
that
direction
past
the
fountain
when
the
explosion
took
place
i
was
hurled
off
my
feet
that
is
the
shock
to
my
nervous
system
was
so
great
that
i
collapsed
my
first
flash
of
thought
was
of
the
fifteen
feet
in
front
of
me
two
men
staggered
it
seemed
to
me
that
one
of
them
had
been
ripped
in
twain
he
fell
and
the
other
fell
on
top
of
him
instantly
the
policemen
around
me
seemed
crazed
as
i
staggered
to
my
feet
one
of
them
struck
me
a
terrific
blow
with
his
club
the
blow
landed
between
my
shoulders
but
glanced
upward
striking
me
on
the
back
of
the
head
i
tumbled
over
dazed
but
the
thought
that
his
next
blow
would
murder
me
seemed
to
give
me
superhuman
strength
and
i
ran
as
i
turned
he
attacked
another
man
and
i
thought
i
was
free
i
was
mistaken
however
for
he
gave
chase
and
if
i
had
not
escaped
into
the
crowd
i
would
have
fared
badly
at
his
hands
my
nerves
were
so
badly
shattered
that
on
the
way
to
my
room
i
fell
several
times
the
following
sunday
night
the
civic
federation
packed
our
meeting
with
their
speakers
gompers
representative
in
new
york
was
the
first
man
put
up
he
was
furnished
with
quotations
from
alleged
socialist
writers
on
the
question
of
religion
then
a
woman
from
boston
who
had
once
been
a
socialist
sent
a
note
to
me
i
was
presiding
asking
for
extended
time
i
was
the
only
socialist
in
the
place
who
knew
what
was
going
on
the
newspapers
had
all
been
tipped
off
as
the
reporter
told
me
later
the
discussion
waxed
so
warm
that
fifty
people
were
on
their
feet
at
once
shouting
for
recognition
humour
in
such
a
situation
is
a
tremendous
relief
i
managed
to
inject
some
into
the
discussion
and
it
was
like
grease
to
a
cartwheel
in
a
humorous
way
i
turned
the
light
on
the
civic
federation
and
the
audience
laughed
next
day
every
newspaper
in
new
york
had
an
account
of
the
meeting
from
that
time
until
the
end
of
the
first
year
of
the
meeting
the
papers
reported
not
only
what
happened
but
much
that
never
happened
most
of
them
were
humorous
in
their
treatment
the
marceline
of
the
press
gave
us
much
space
in
its
characteristic
style
the
result
was
that
we
were
forced
to
have
policemen
guard
the
door
so
that
when
the
chapel
was
full
the
crowd
unable
to
gain
admittance
could
be
dispersed
we
admitted
by
ticket
for
some
weeks
but
the
plan
did
work
well
of
course
many
who
came
were
moved
solely
by
curiosity
but
for
two
years
the
chapel
has
been
filled
at
every
meeting
on
the
wildest
winter
nights
it
looked
sometimes
as
if
the
choir
was
to
be
my
only
audience
yet
when
the
opened
the
place
was
as
full
as
usual
the
sunday
evening
service
is
designed
to
be
of
special
helpfulness
to
working
people
it
is
an
extra
service
permitted
by
the
canons
of
the
church
and
in
this
instance
directed
to
helpful
and
constructive
social
criticism
the
discourses
have
not
been
theological
in
any
sense
but
i
have
seen
men
and
women
converted
experiencing
a
change
of
heart
in
exactly
the
same
manner
as
people
are
converted
in
revival
meetings
the
same
energies
of
the
soul
were
released
and
the
same
results
obtained
with
this
extra
consideration
that
the
change
was
a
new
attitude
toward
society
as
well
as
a
change
of
heart
men
and
women
who
had
not
been
in
church
since
they
were
children
have
found
an
atmosphere
a
spiritual
atmosphere
that
has
been
a
distinct
help
to
them
during
the
week
there
have
been
unique
examples
of
this
that
can
not
be
recorded
or
catalogued
if
we
were
padding
a
bolstering
a
creed
or
attracting
men
merely
to
put
our
tag
on
them
the
meetings
would
have
waned
long
ago
for
the
class
of
people
who
attend
are
quick
to
discover
undercurrents
or
ulterior
motives
the
spiritual
atmosphere
is
created
by
a
combination
of
forces
the
picture
of
the
ascension
by
la
farge
has
contributed
not
a
little
to
it
even
to
people
to
whom
the
circumstance
was
a
myth
the
architecture
and
music
contributed
much
we
held
the
in
the
church
one
night
to
accommodate
hundreds
of
people
who
could
get
into
the
chapel
the
meeting
was
a
failure
the
most
radically
minded
men
told
me
that
they
could
talk
in
the
church
why
i
asked
one
if
i
know
but
it
took
the
fight
out
of
me
it
took
the
fight
out
of
all
so
we
went
back
to
the
chapel
one
man
whom
i
have
known
for
years
as
a
socialist
agitator
who
fought
the
intellectuals
in
his
party
and
was
a
materialist
of
the
most
radical
kind
made
this
statement
at
the
last
meeting
of
the
first
year
i
appreciate
the
courage
of
grant
in
opening
this
church
to
the
people
and
opening
its
pulpit
to
a
representative
of
the
people
i
am
grateful
for
the
fine
fellowship
the
freedom
of
discussion
the
music
the
beautiful
architecture
and
the
inspiration
that
comes
from
such
contact
but
these
are
the
smallest
of
what
has
come
to
me
during
the
past
winter
i
am
the
son
of
an
orthodox
rabbi
but
i
have
been
an
atheist
all
my
life
i
have
been
and
destructive
in
my
addresses
i
have
learned
something
here
i
did
not
expect
nor
did
i
want
to
but
i
have
i
am
now
a
believer
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
i
look
forward
to
life
instead
of
death
this
has
influenced
my
work
my
life
instead
of
a
hundred
words
against
human
slavery
to
one
for
human
freedom
i
speak
a
hundred
for
human
freedom
to
one
against
human
slavery
that
may
seem
small
to
you
it
big
to
me
it
a
new
psychology
a
school
teacher
a
brilliant
young
jewess
said
the
inspiration
of
that
service
in
the
church
lasts
all
week
with
my
scholars
i
am
worth
twice
as
much
as
i
was
to
the
public
schools
a
letter
from
a
trained
nurse
says
i
am
going
away
for
the
summer
but
before
i
go
i
want
you
to
know
how
much
of
a
blessing
your
service
has
been
to
me
and
to
both
physicians
and
nurses
in
this
hospital
for
we
have
all
been
at
one
time
or
another
and
we
have
always
talked
over
your
topics
with
interest
and
profit
during
the
first
year
we
had
a
tremendous
stimulus
in
the
meetings
from
the
active
participation
of
four
of
the
most
prominent
theosophists
in
the
country
two
of
whom
are
members
of
the
vestry
they
sharpened
the
line
between
spiritual
and
material
things
they
brought
to
the
notice
of
socialists
the
essential
things
of
the
soul
they
made
the
meetings
a
in
which
the
finest
best
and
most
permanent
things
were
made
to
stand
out
distinctly
the
world
affords
not
a
better
field
either
for
the
testing
or
propagating
of
their
philosophy
but
they
did
not
come
the
second
year
and
we
missed
them
very
much
there
was
a
good
deal
of
misunderstanding
about
the
meetings
arising
from
garbled
newspaper
reports
the
newspaper
reporter
has
a
bias
for
things
off
colour
he
sees
only
the
carrion
at
least
he
is
trained
to
report
only
the
carrion
this
always
against
his
will
so
we
were
kept
explaining
to
men
and
women
of
the
church
who
had
not
been
able
to
attend
and
see
for
themselves
there
was
not
only
misunderstanding
but
prejudice
i
came
in
contact
with
it
in
quarters
the
most
unlikely
the
people
of
independent
means
in
the
church
of
the
ascension
have
social
ideals
those
of
the
working
class
who
are
in
the
church
have
none
none
whatever
and
what
prejudice
i
found
came
from
those
who
had
never
contributed
anything
to
the
church
but
their
presence
and
to
whom
the
church
from
their
childhood
had
been
an
almshouse
a
hospital
and
a
place
of
amusement
these
were
the
people
baptized
and
confirmed
christians
who
spoke
with
bitterness
and
a
sneer
of
the
evening
meetings
because
the
majority
of
the
attendants
were
jews
the
other
phase
of
their
prejudice
was
against
socialism
which
they
supposed
to
be
a
process
of
dividing
up
my
chief
encouragement
came
from
the
richest
people
in
the
church
the
sneer
came
from
the
poorest
the
range
of
topics
was
as
wide
as
the
interests
of
human
life
the
speakers
were
the
leading
men
of
new
york
and
distinguished
visitors
from
other
lands
one
of
the
earliest
speakers
was
cobden
sanderson
the
daughter
of
richard
cobden
and
the
intimate
friend
of
william
morris
capitalism
was
represented
by
professor
clark
thomas
slicer
and
herman
robinson
of
the
american
federation
of
labour
there
were
many
others
of
course
but
these
were
the
best
known
the
socialist
leaders
were
ghent
rufus
weeks
gaylord
wilshire
and
bruére
exponents
of
individualism
were
many
and
most
of
them
were
brilliant
the
most
powerful
address
on
behalf
of
labour
was
made
by
fulton
cutting
there
has
been
no
attempt
to
bait
an
ecclesiastical
hook
to
catch
the
masses
we
have
tried
to
make
men
think
and
to
act
on
their
best
thought
this
venture
in
ecclesiology
is
not
the
democratization
of
a
church
it
is
the
leadership
of
a
rector
grant
is
an
ecclesiastical
statesman
he
has
a
strong
cabinet
in
his
vestry
men
who
having
made
big
ventures
in
the
business
world
are
not
averse
to
an
occasional
venture
in
matters
not
directly
in
their
line
he
has
enough
reaction
among
them
to
keep
the
balance
level
the
church
of
the
ascension
is
the
real
cathedral
of
new
york
what
matters
it
about
canon
chapter
dean
and
prebend
a
cathedral
is
a
church
of
the
people
all
the
people
chapter
xxii
my
socialism
my
religion
and
my
home
my
vision
spiritual
came
to
me
out
of
the
unknown
the
facts
and
experiences
of
life
led
me
to
socialism
in
each
case
it
was
a
rebirth
the
way
of
jesus
was
at
first
a
state
of
mind
it
had
no
relation
to
a
book
it
had
no
connection
with
a
church
socialism
is
a
passion
for
the
regeneration
of
society
it
is
a
state
of
mind
a
point
of
view
the
religion
of
the
peasant
saviour
and
the
movement
for
industrial
democracy
expand
as
they
are
understood
both
thrive
under
opposition
and
are
retarded
only
by
unfaithful
friends
i
caught
the
spirit
then
studied
the
forms
i
got
tired
of
doling
out
alms
it
became
degrading
to
me
either
to
take
them
from
the
rich
or
to
give
them
to
the
poor
almsgiving
deludes
the
one
and
demoralizes
the
other
i
had
distributed
the
crumbs
that
fall
from
rich
men
tables
until
my
soul
became
sick
i
expected
lazarus
the
legion
to
be
grateful
i
expected
him
to
become
pious
to
attend
church
to
number
himself
with
the
saved
and
he
did
almsgiving
not
only
degrades
the
recipient
but
the
medium
also
the
average
minister
or
missionary
is
looked
upon
by
the
middle
and
upper
classes
as
a
sort
of
refined
pauper
himself
so
like
a
mendicant
he
goes
to
the
merchant
and
trades
his
piety
for
a
rebate
of
ten
per
cent
or
he
travels
on
a
child
fare
on
the
railroads
i
have
scores
of
times
given
away
my
own
clothes
and
have
gone
to
the
missionary
dorcas
room
and
fitted
myself
out
with
somebody
garments
and
i
too
was
expected
to
be
grateful
and
to
write
of
my
gratitude
to
the
person
who
for
jesus
sake
had
cleaned
out
his
cellar
or
garret
in
the
west
i
have
been
the
recipient
of
home
missionary
barrels
packed
in
some
rich
church
in
new
york
or
new
england
annual
barrels
in
which
there
is
usually
a
suit
for
the
missionary
bought
by
some
dear
old
lady
to
whom
all
men
were
alike
in
size
this
whole
process
is
hoary
antiquated
stupid
and
degrading
my
socialism
is
the
outcome
of
my
desire
to
make
real
the
dreams
i
have
dreamed
of
god
it
came
to
me
not
through
marx
or
lassalle
but
by
the
way
of
moses
and
jesus
twenty
years
experience
in
reform
movements
taught
me
the
hopelessness
of
reformation
from
without
it
was
like
soldering
up
a
thousand
little
holes
in
the
bottom
of
a
kettle
for
a
hundred
years
men
and
women
have
been
begging
the
industrial
lords
to
spare
the
little
children
of
the
poor
have
they
ask
the
census
taker
millions
of
them
are
the
victims
of
the
sweater
the
dealer
in
human
endurance
the
cure
for
child
labour
is
justice
to
the
father
and
justice
to
the
father
is
his
full
share
of
the
good
things
of
life
as
long
as
he
has
to
pay
tribute
to
a
horde
of
who
have
merely
invested
in
his
endurance
so
long
will
he
be
unable
to
keep
his
child
at
school
it
is
the
daughters
of
the
poor
that
become
the
victims
of
lust
fantine
is
the
daughter
of
a
working
man
she
is
multiplied
by
tens
of
thousands
on
the
streets
of
great
cities
selling
her
soul
for
a
morsel
of
bread
we
are
hardened
to
that
and
we
think
we
are
meriting
the
approbation
of
angels
when
we
start
a
rescue
mission
for
her
special
class
how
pure
in
the
sight
of
god
is
poor
fantine
when
compared
with
the
cowards
who
will
not
smash
the
mill
of
which
she
is
the
mere
grist
just
so
long
as
there
is
a
cash
consideration
in
her
life
must
capitalism
bear
the
burden
of
her
sin
there
were
millions
of
men
out
of
work
last
winter
the
political
parties
took
no
notice
the
leaders
knew
the
minds
of
the
electors
they
knew
that
those
millions
of
unemployed
were
too
stupid
to
see
any
connection
between
government
and
work
taft
was
asked
in
the
campaign
what
a
workless
homeless
man
could
do
to
find
employment
god
knows
was
his
reply
out
of
this
army
of
the
unemployed
the
ranks
of
the
criminals
are
reinforced
and
the
search
for
creature
comforts
recruits
the
ranks
of
women
who
are
not
fallen
but
knocked
down
the
supreme
function
of
the
state
is
to
make
it
easy
for
citizens
to
live
in
harmony
with
one
another
and
hard
to
be
out
of
joint
poverty
is
the
mother
curse
of
the
ages
no
man
suffering
from
her
withering
blighting
touch
can
be
in
harmony
with
the
best
socialism
tackles
the
master
job
of
abolishing
it
not
by
any
fantastic
plan
of
redistribution
but
by
giving
to
the
creator
all
that
he
creates
and
to
the
social
charges
pensioners
and
cripples
an
assurance
of
life
without
the
stigma
of
pauperism
socialism
asks
for
the
application
of
science
to
the
disease
of
poverty
science
has
chained
the
lightning
and
harnessed
the
ether
waves
it
has
filled
the
world
with
horseless
carriages
and
is
now
filling
the
air
with
machines
that
fly
like
birds
the
inventions
of
the
last
twenty
years
are
modern
miracles
but
the
sunken
millions
of
our
fellowmen
never
speak
through
a
telephone
never
ride
in
an
automobile
never
send
a
telegram
never
read
good
books
or
see
good
plays
they
make
all
these
things
they
make
them
all
possible
for
others
but
the
enjoyment
of
them
is
beyond
their
wildest
dreams
the
strength
of
the
social
chain
can
not
be
greater
than
its
weakest
link
socialists
are
grouped
around
the
thin
places
the
leakages
the
weaknesses
of
democracy
and
engross
themselves
in
making
them
strong
the
propaganda
in
times
past
wielded
only
a
sword
now
it
has
a
trowel
socialism
is
a
positive
force
it
is
leaven
in
the
lump
the
party
has
a
discipline
which
often
hampers
its
own
progress
but
in
the
regimentation
of
an
idea
discipline
can
not
be
dispensed
with
there
are
socialists
who
see
only
the
goal
are
not
willing
to
see
anything
else
or
less
there
are
others
who
see
every
step
of
the
way
and
emphasize
each
step
what
kind
of
a
socialist
are
you
a
rich
man
asked
me
the
other
day
catalogue
me
with
the
worst
i
said
for
he
who
numbers
himself
with
the
transgressors
is
in
direct
apostolic
succession
the
socialists
are
the
only
people
who
seem
to
have
the
bible
idea
of
work
the
scriptures
make
no
provision
for
parasites
in
the
commonwealth
of
israel
everybody
worked
when
there
was
a
departure
from
this
ideal
came
the
prophet
to
speak
for
god
and
the
divine
order
socialists
are
doing
for
america
what
the
prophets
did
for
israel
thousands
of
years
ago
we
are
pointing
the
way
to
simple
and
right
living
to
justice
brotherhood
and
religion
socialism
is
not
an
ultimate
conception
of
society
it
only
paves
the
way
for
a
divine
individualism
when
the
fear
of
hunger
is
vanished
men
will
have
a
chance
to
be
individuals
men
striving
all
their
lives
to
live
to
merely
live
have
no
time
no
opportunity
for
a
career
opposition
to
the
democratic
ideal
of
socialism
is
based
on
ignorance
opponents
ask
for
a
mechanical
contrivance
that
will
wind
up
and
go
like
a
clock
we
are
asked
questions
that
only
our
can
answer
we
are
told
by
the
good
people
that
the
ideal
leaves
out
god
the
british
parliament
proclaimed
that
bloodhounds
and
scalping
were
means
that
god
and
nature
had
given
into
its
hand
a
coal
baron
of
pennsylvania
declares
that
god
has
entrusted
a
few
men
with
untold
wealth
and
consigned
a
multitude
to
degrading
poverty
that
kind
of
a
god
the
democratic
ideal
does
leave
out
he
is
a
god
spun
out
of
the
fertile
brain
of
the
materialist
critics
of
socialism
assume
and
herald
their
own
patriotism
their
devotion
to
law
and
order
but
they
are
usually
men
who
distrust
any
extension
of
the
functions
of
the
state
not
directly
beneficial
to
their
personal
interests
the
socialists
of
know
that
their
ideal
can
not
be
realized
during
their
lifetime
they
are
people
of
vision
they
are
not
saying
lord
lord
but
they
are
bringing
in
his
kingdom
the
early
socialists
met
their
worst
opposition
in
a
corrupt
church
and
their
writings
were
coloured
by
the
conflict
we
are
asked
to
stand
sponsor
for
all
they
said
one
might
as
well
charge
century
christians
with
the
horrors
of
the
inquisition
we
are
not
even
willing
to
stand
sponsor
for
their
economics
many
of
their
prophecies
are
yet
unfulfilled
the
currents
of
thought
and
action
are
not
flowing
in
the
direction
they
anticipated
but
the
facts
they
faced
have
altered
little
and
we
moderns
have
made
our
own
diagnosis
and
we
have
decided
on
a
remedy
the
remedy
is
not
revolution
in
the
historic
sense
it
is
not
a
cataclysm
it
has
no
room
for
hatred
its
method
is
evolutionary
its
is
solidarity
its
hope
is
regeneration
the
process
levels
up
not
down
it
has
an
upward
look
it
will
abolish
class
struggles
and
divisions
it
will
usher
in
a
reign
of
peace
just
at
present
it
is
a
class
struggle
a
struggle
on
behalf
of
that
social
group
of
labourers
on
whose
back
are
borne
the
heaviest
burdens
but
it
is
no
more
a
labour
movement
than
the
emancipation
of
the
slaves
was
a
negro
movement
the
man
who
enunciated
the
doctrine
of
the
class
struggle
belonged
only
by
soul
contact
to
the
struggling
class
the
socialist
appeal
is
made
directly
to
that
class
for
until
it
is
awakened
to
its
own
peril
and
its
own
need
little
progress
can
be
made
changes
in
society
are
like
changes
in
human
character
they
must
have
their
origin
in
the
heart
and
work
outward
it
is
at
the
heart
of
things
we
place
our
hope
and
the
secret
of
the
social
passion
to
me
is
the
knowledge
that
i
am
a
coöperator
with
god
there
comes
over
me
occasionally
an
idea
as
i
look
into
the
future
that
the
fact
may
become
the
mockery
of
the
dream
our
temples
are
built
with
hands
they
are
fair
to
look
upon
even
in
the
dream
but
other
builders
will
come
and
build
on
other
foundations
temples
of
the
soul
more
fair
more
enduring
socialism
the
fact
will
have
the
higher
individualism
as
the
dream
but
the
conflict
will
be
lifted
from
the
sordid
plane
of
the
stomach
to
the
realm
of
mind
heart
and
soul
the
apologist
of
the
is
of
all
things
the
most
pitiful
if
a
politician
he
has
no
dream
if
a
business
man
he
has
no
vision
if
a
preacher
he
lives
in
a
mausoleum
of
dead
hopes
to
these
the
ten
commandments
sum
up
the
moral
order
of
the
universe
the
eleventh
commandment
shares
the
fate
of
the
seed
that
fell
on
stony
ground
the
worst
that
a
man
can
do
against
the
democratic
ideal
is
not
to
work
for
it
he
might
as
well
fight
against
the
stars
in
their
courses
what
does
it
matter
who
brings
it
to
pass
or
how
it
comes
to
work
for
it
is
the
thing
to
feel
the
thrill
of
a
a
to
be
in
line
with
the
workers
and
touch
hands
with
men
of
all
creeds
all
classes
this
is
social
joy
this
is
incentive
for
life
then
a
man
shall
work
and
bethink
him
and
rejoice
in
the
deeds
of
his
hand
nor
yet
come
home
in
the
even
too
faint
and
weary
to
stand
men
in
that
time
shall
work
and
have
no
fear
for
lack
of
earning
and
the
oh
strange
new
wonderful
justice
but
for
whom
shall
we
gather
the
gain
for
ourselves
and
for
each
of
our
fellows
and
no
hand
shall
labour
in
vain
then
all
mine
and
all
thine
shall
be
ours
and
no
more
shall
any
man
crave
for
riches
that
serve
for
nothing
but
to
fetter
a
friend
for
a
slave
and
what
wealth
then
shall
be
left
us
when
none
shall
gather
gold
to
buy
his
friend
in
the
market
and
pinch
and
pine
the
sold
nay
what
save
the
lovely
city
and
the
little
house
on
the
hill
and
the
wastes
and
the
woodland
beauty
and
the
happy
fields
we
till
and
the
homes
of
ancient
stories
the
tombs
of
the
mighty
dead
and
the
wise
men
seeking
out
marvels
and
the
poet
teaming
head
and
the
painter
hand
of
wonder
and
the
marvellous
and
the
banded
choirs
of
music
all
those
that
do
and
know
for
all
these
shall
be
ours
and
all
men
nor
shall
any
lack
a
share
of
the
toil
and
the
gain
of
living
in
the
days
when
the
world
grows
fair
in
the
very
advent
of
my
spiritual
life
i
gravitated
toward
the
church
there
i
added
to
my
faith
a
theology
a
theologian
is
a
fighter
a
doctrinaire
every
item
of
knowledge
i
got
i
sharpened
into
a
weapon
to
confound
the
catholics
before
my
nakedness
was
wholly
covered
i
was
shouting
with
my
sect
for
queen
and
constitution
and
i
could
discuss
the
historic
episcopate
before
i
could
write
my
own
name
then
came
a
hidebound
orthodoxy
i
measured
life
by
a
book
and
for
every
ill
that
flesh
is
heir
to
i
had
an
appropriate
text
i
had
a
formula
for
the
salvation
of
the
race
i
divided
humanity
into
two
camps
the
goats
and
the
sheep
i
had
a
literal
hell
for
one
crowd
and
a
beautiful
heaven
for
the
other
the
logical
result
of
this
was
a
caste
of
good
saved
people
for
whom
i
became
a
sort
of
an
ecclesiastical
attorney
naturally
one
outgrows
such
obsolescence
such
archaism
has
an
antidote
it
is
an
study
of
the
life
of
jesus
the
result
of
such
a
study
to
me
was
a
rediscovery
of
myself
that
i
think
is
what
jesus
always
does
for
an
inquiring
soul
he
is
the
supreme
individualist
the
master
of
personality
i
did
not
ask
him
what
to
wear
or
how
to
vote
i
did
not
even
ask
him
what
was
moral
or
immoral
for
these
things
change
with
time
and
place
and
circumstance
i
asked
him
the
old
eternal
questions
of
life
and
death
and
immortality
of
god
and
my
neighbour
of
sin
and
service
the
answers
stripped
me
of
fear
and
gave
me
a
scorn
of
consequences
the
secret
of
jesus
is
to
find
god
in
the
soul
of
humanity
the
cause
of
jesus
is
the
righting
of
world
wrongs
the
religion
of
jesus
the
binding
together
of
souls
in
the
solidarity
of
the
race
three

god
had
just
taken
a
big
handful
of
earth
out
from

made

rises
almost
perpendicularly
a

hundred
feet
high

in

glory

a

from
any

i
asked
when
buying
somewhere
said
the
owner
but
she
was
not
quite
sure
one
day
i
was
exploring
the
fastnesses
and
came
upon
a
rock
ledge
standing
a
hundred
feet
high
i
walked
to
the
edge
pushed
the
branches
of
the
elder
bushes
aside
and
out
there
in
front
of
me
lay
that
glorious
valley
and
beyond
the
valley
over
the
top
of
my
house
lay
the
mighty
river
like
an
unsheathed
sword
on
that
ledge
i
have
built
a
platform
of
white
birch

behind
the
platform

i
have

have
named

memory
of
the
valued
friendships
formed
at
the
church
on
fifth
avenue
on
the
edge
of
the
meadow
beside
the
old
road
that
leads
to
the
river
stands
the
farmhouse
it
is
sheltered
from
winter
winds
by
the
hills
and
from
summer
sun
by
elm
maple
and
walnut
trees
there
is
nothing
to
boast
of
in
the
arrangement
it
was
built
quickly
and
not
if
the
man
who
planned
it
had
any
more
taste
than
a
cow
he
must
have
expressed
it
on
the
building
of
the
barn
not
on
the
house
it
had
been
heated
with
stoves
for
years
but
i
tore
away
the
boards
that
covered
the
open
fireplaces
i
built
a
cistern
on
the
hill
and
a
cesspool
down
in
the
meadow
and
between
them
in
a
large
room
in
the
house
arranged
a
bathroom
a
big
bathroom
big
enough
to
swing
a
cat
around
i
am
now
knocking
a
wall
down
here
and
there
wiping
some
outbuildings
off
the
map
and
by
degrees
making
it
habitable
throughout
the
year
there
is
a
orchard
on
the
hill
east
of
the
house
and
through
it
runs
a
brook
that
can
be
turned
to
good
account
i
had
a
population
of
during
the
summer
they
were
encamped
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
each
other
in
tents
overhauled
barns
etc
we
were
all
socialists
dreamers
of
dreams
of
course
we
had
to
eat
and
as
the
fad
did
not
appeal
to
us
we
had
to
have
a
fire
on
which
to
cook
and
as
there
was
an
abundance
of
wood
i
instituted
a
wood
pile
to
any
one
about
to
form
a
coöperative
community
i
can
recommend
this
institution
as
an
infinitely
better
gauge
of
human
character
than
either
the
ten
commandments
or
the
royal
pathway
we
need
much
wood
and
there
were
plenty
of
men
we
had
good
tools
and
i
was
going
to
say
wood
to
burn
it
was
jolly
good
fun
do
you
know
to
hack
up
about
three
sticks
then
the
woodcutter
would
have
a
story
to
tell
or
he
had
something
he
had
left
undone
for
days
there
was
an
atmosphere
around
the
pile
that
affected
us
as
the
hookworm
affects
its
victims
in
some
southern
communities
we
grew
listless
dull
flaccid
the
influence
was
baneful
subtle
none
of
us
ever
confessed
to
being
affected
it
rather
emphasized
our
idealism
in
the
future
said
one
comrade
as
he
laid
the
axe
down
after
his
second
stick
wood
will
be
cut
by
machinery
we
looked
interested
yes
he
said
as
he
rolled
a
cigarette
there
will
be
a
machine
that
will
cut
a
cord
a
second
why
do
you
invent
one
we
asked
how
can
one
invent
anything
in
this
slave
age
he
asked
as
he
glared
at
us
between
the
curling
puffs
of
smoke
that
true
we
said
and
piped
down
he
went
over
to
the
well
to
get
a
drink
the
housekeeper
called
for
firewood
he
smiled
he
was
a
jolly
chap
keep
cool
comrades
he
said
gently
it
be
all
the
same
in
a
thousand
years
the
axe
was
blunt
he
took
it
to
the
grindstone
a
new
patent
with
a
bicycle
seat
on
it
and
there
he
sat
puffing
and
grinding
until
a
neighbour
cow
broke
into
our
corn
he
dropped
the
axe
and
went
after
the
cow
the
housekeeper
kept
calling
for
wood
another
comrade
was
pressed
into
the
killing
ether
and
he
smashed
and
hacked
for
five
minutes
then
he
straightened
himself
up
and
said
with
a
look
of
disgust
on
his
face
that
a
mucker
job
who
will
be
the
muckers
under
socialism
i
asked
mildly
the
dull
brainless
clods
who
can
do
nothing
else
he
said
just
then
our
neighbour
hired
man
a
russian
muzik
passed
with
his
he
wore
a
smock
of
his
own
making
and
a
pair
of
shoes
he
had
made
of
hickory
bark
that
said
the
comrade
at
the
block
in
a
stage
whisper
is
the
type
that
will
do
the
rough
work
you
could
wake
that
thing
up
with
a
plug
of
dynamite
we
watched
michael
and
his
as
they
lumbered
lazily
along
the
lane
illustration
happy
hollow
in
the
winter
looking
from
the
house
we
had
one
poet
in
our
midst
just
one
he
had
lately
completed
a
poem
on
the
glories
of
our
valley
two
men
stooped
to
pick
up
the
axe
gaston
and
alphonse
like
they
stooped
together
as
they
did
so
the
poet
came
along
with
a
beaming
face
stop
he
said
listen
boys
listen
we
all
straightened
up
and
stood
at
attention
he
read
not
far
from
turmoil
strife
the
waves
of
life
antagonisms
that
delude
the
world
amidst
elysian
valleys
slopes
majestic
hills
and
caves
that
mark
the
path
where
ages
wrought
their
wrath
and
hurled
the
crumbling
sinews
of
the
soil
down
to
defeat
to
linger
in
the
depth
as
symbols
that
all
power
is
at
the
will
of
the
supreme
in
this
retreat
filled
with
the
chirping
music
of
the
nightly
hour
and
seeking
rest
from
joyous
toil
reward
for
which
is
given
by
the
thought
that
all
is
mine
that
none
do
rob
that
love
adds
to
each
stroke
its
rich
and
sweetening
cheer
in
such
rare
world
that
i
have
won
the
housekeeper
rudely
broke
the
spell
you
comrades
had
better
eat
that
poetry
for
dinner
she
said
we
all
looked
and
all
understood
all
save
the
poet
he
looked
aghast
thinking
in
yiddish
go
on
somebody
said
but
the
poet
was
a
sensitive
youth
and
could
sense
an
atmosphere
quicker
than
most
of
us
wood
said
the
housekeeper
pointing
at
the
few
sticks
lying
around
the
block
ah
exclaimed
the
poet
as
he
took
up
the
axe
you
shall
have
it
comrade
have
it
good
and
plenty
he
laid
the
poem
in
the
white
birch
frame
against
a
stone
and
proceeded
we
moved
away
every
man
to
his
own
place
in
a
community
where
the
communers
have
to
chop
the
canned
salmon
is
a
good
standby
that
day
we
had
salmon
for
dinner
just
as
a
matter
of
encouragement
i
had
the
artist
of
the
community
print
a
latin
motto
in
fine
gothic
characters
laborare
est
orare
this
i
tacked
to
the
block
at
the
woodpile
we
had
one
orator
in
the
community
just
one
next
morning
when
the
motto
stared
him
in
the
face
he
said
gee
whiz
that
great
labour
is
oratory
it
was
a
blow
at
a
venture
in
the
interpretation
of
latin
and
instead
of
wood
to
cook
the
breakfast
we
had
a
speech
on
the
labour
of
the
orator
the
idea
that
i
was
giving
land
away
got
noised
abroad
and
a
thousand
letters
of
inquiry
came
to
me
most
of
the
inquirers
asked
if
i
gave
deeds
to
the
land
others
got
an
idea
that
i
had
a
coöperative
colony
and
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
come
and
plant
themselves
on
the
land
i
never
intended
to
organize
a
colony
but
i
did
invite
some
families
to
enjoy
the
summer
on
the
farm
i
shall
not
ask
as
many
next
year
for
i
have
no
talent
as
a
manager
and
it
takes
more
management
than
i
imagined
to
look
after
even
half
a
dozen
families
i
had
a
number
of
parties
from
the
city
during
the
summer
the
largest
being
from
the
church
of
the
ascension
and
the
cosmopolitan
church
from
ascension
church
came
a
young
men
club
on
decoration
day
i
introduced
the
boys
to
their
first
experience
in
archery
the
people
from
the
cosmopolitan
church
came
on
a
sunday
and
i
took
them
over
the
hill
to
call
on
my
friends
the
franciscan
monks
of
the
society
of
the
atonement
the
franciscans
are
my
nearest
neighbours
on
the
north
and
on
the
south
is
my
neighbour
epstein
a
russian
jewish
farmer
from
the
north
we
have
had
an
intellectual
and
moral
fellowship
and
from
the
south
the
comradeship
of
the
soil
to
epstein
bull
we
are
indebted
for
the
element
of
excitement
a
very
necessary
element
if
one
could
get
it
in
any
sort
of
orderly
arrangement
the
bull
objected
to
epstein
interfering
in
what
might
be
called
his
the
bull
family
affairs
he
tossed
his
owner
into
the
air
three
times
one
afternoon
in
my
meadow
and
but
for
the
timely
interference
of
a
dog
would
have
gathered
the
farmer
to
his
fathers
several
of
our
community
saw
the
incident
but
the
vibrations
had
a
more
enervating
effect
than
even
those
around
the
woodpile
and
being
armed
only
with
the
first
law
of
nature
they
left
the
honours
of
the
incident
to
the
dog
the
following
sunday
morning
i
saw
a
crowd
in
epstein
orchard
it
looked
like
a
small
county
fair
a
cow
doctor
had
been
imported
to
perform
an
operation
on
the
bull
epstein
and
his
muzik
michael
almost
came
to
blows
in
trying
to
decide
which
of
them
should
put
the
yoke
on
the
bull
neck
no
decent
farmer
will
stand
aloof
in
such
a
crisis
so
i
threw
my
coat
off
and
offered
my
services
the
patient
made
serious
objections
to
me
but
permitted
the
yoke
to
be
adjusted
by
a
day
labourer
named
harvey
outhouse
this
holstein
aristocrat
had
a
terrible
he
used
to
stalk
around
as
if
he
owned
the
earth
but
now
he
is
a
common
hewer
of
wood
and
drawer
of
water
like
ourselves
i
see
him
occasionally
now
pulling
a
heavy
load
of
stones
or
hay
past
our
place
as
meekly
and
quiet
as
the
dull
ox
by
his
side
and
involuntarily
i
exclaim
how
are
the
mighty
fallen
i
have
a
horse
and
a
cow
the
artist
of
the
community
who
remains
as
one
of
my
family
took
charge
of
the
cow
and
the
care
of
the
horse
was
distributed
among
the
rest
of
us
the
house
is
made
comfortable
and
snug
for
the
winter
and
i
have
settled
down
here
for
the
remainder
of
my
life
with
my
family
are
these
two
comrades
the
artist
and
the
mechanic
and
we
are
in
complete
harmony
in
work
and
ideals
i
have
been
a
gypsy
most
of
my
life
i
am
to
have
a
respite
now
here
in
this
corner
of
putnam
county
i
have
found
my
happy
hills
of
rest
my
work
will
always
be
in
the
city
but
here
my
home
is
to
me
and
here
i
am
to
do
my
writing
thinking
living
in
the
solitude
of
these
woods
i
am
to
find
inspiration
and
quiet
here
i
am
to
dream
my
dreams
and
see
my
visions
i
am
years
of
age
now
but
i
have
the
health
and
vigour
of
a
boy
and
i
feel
that
for
me
life
has
just
really
begun
i
have
but
one
ambition
it
is
not
wealth
or
fame
or
even
rest
it
is
to
be
of
service
to
my
for
that
is
my
highest
conception
of
service
to
god
this
memoir
is
but
a
catalogue
of
events
a
series
of
milestones
that
i
have
passed
my
life
has
been
at
times
such
a
tempest
and
at
other
times
such
a
calm
and
between
these
extremes
i
have
failed
so
often
and
my
successes
have
been
so
phenomenal
that
the
world
would
not
believe
a
true
recital
of
the
facts
even
though
i
were
able
to
write
them
the
conflicts
of
the
soul
the
scalding
tears
that
bespeak
the
breaking
heart
can
not
be
reduced
to
print
nevertheless
i
hope
that
what
i
have
written
may
be
of
encouragement
to
my
along
the
highway
of
life
especially
men
who
mistakenly
imagine
they
have
been
worsted
in
the
fight
there
is
a
great
truth
in
the
doctrine
of
the
economic
interpretation
of
history
but
there
is
also
truth
and
a
mighty
truth
in
the
spiritual
interpretation
of
life
the
awakened
human
soul
is
indissolubly
inknit
with
the
warp
and
woof
of
things
divine
it
fights
not
alone
it
is
linked
with
god
no
man
is
born
into
the
world
whose
work
is
not
born
with
him
there
is
always
work
and
tools
to
work
withal
for
those
who
will
and
blessed
are
the
horny
hands
of
toil
the
busy
world
shoves
angrily
aside
the
man
who
stands
with
arms
akimbo
set
until
occasion
tells
him
what
to
do
and
he
who
waits
to
have
his
task
worked
out
shall
die
and
leave
his
errand
