which
was
built
into
one
of

corners
served
as
a
place
of
deposit
for

required
this

consisted
of
storehouses

in
some
cases
the

were
constructed

the
population
which
had

together
there
was
of
a
peculiar
character
and
we
can
gather
but
a
feeble
idea
of
its
nature
from
the
surroundings
of
the
cemeteries
in
our
own
great
cities
death
required
in
fact
far
more
attendants
among
the
ancient
egyptians
than
with
us
the
first
service
was
that
of
mummification
which
necessitated
numbers
of
workers
for
its
accomplishment
some
of
the
workshops
of
the
embalmers
have
been
discovered
from
time
to
time
at
sheikh
abd
and
deîr
but
we
are
still
in
ignorance
as
to
their
arrangements
and
as
to
the
exact
nature
of
the
materials
which
they
employed
a
considerable
superficial
space
was
required
for
the
manipulations
of
the
embalmers
occupied
usually
from
sixty
to
eighty
days
and
if
we
suppose
that
the
average
deaths
at
thebes
amounted
to
fifteen
or
twenty
in
the
hours
they
would
have
to
provide
at
the
same
time
for
the
various
degrees
of
saturation
of
some
twelve
to
fifteen
hundred
bodies
at
the
least
the
discovery
of
quantities
of
ostraca
in
the
ruins
of
these
chambers
shows
that
they
served
partly
for
cellars
i
have
formed
my
estimate
of
fifteen
to
twenty
deaths
per
day
from
the
mortality
of
cairo
during
the
french
occupation
this
is
given
by
desgenettes
in
the
de
but
only
approximately
as
many
deaths
especially
of
females
must
have
been
concealed
from
the
authorities
i
have
however
made
an
average
from
the
totals
and
applied
the
rate
of
mortality
thus
obtained
to
ancient
thebes
the
same
result
follows
from
calculations
based
on
more
recent
figures
obtained
before
the
great
hygienic
changes
introduced
into
cairo
by
ismail
pacha
from
august
to
july
and
from
may
to
may
and
for
the
two
years
from
april
to
march
and
from
april
to
march
each
of
the
corpses
moreover
necessitated
the
employment
of
at
least
half
a
dozen
workmen
to
wash
it
cut
it
open
soak
it
dry

apply
the
usual

his
pilgrimage
towards

the

the

gave
him
access
to

it

of
course
deaf

pursued

now
recovered
its
original
height

the
pyramid
had
correspondingly
decreased

themselves

employed

transport

friends

its
back

the
assistants

having
been
accompanied

his
friends
to

him
take
possession
turns
for
a
moment

the
threshold
to
take
leave
of
them
before
entering
a
sacrifice
an
offering
a
prayer
and
a
fresh
outburst
of
grief
ensued
the
mourners
redoubled
their
cries
and
threw
themselves
upon
the
ground
the
relatives
decked
the
mummy
with
flowers
and
pressed
it
to
their
bared
bosoms
kissing
it
upon
the
breast

again
broke
out

the
chapel
was
usually
divided
into
two
chambers
one
which
was
of
greater
width
than
length
ran
parallel
to
the
façade
the
other
which
was
longer
than
it
was
wide
stood
at
right
angles
with
the
former
exactly
opposite
to
the
entrance
the
decoration
of
these
chambers
took
its
inspiration
from
the
scheme
which
prevailed
in
the
time
of
the
memphite
dynasties
but
besides
the
usual
scenes
of
agricultural
labour
hunting
and
sacrifice
there
were
introduced
episodes
from
the
public
life
of
the
deceased
and

minute
portrayal

ceremonies
connected

was
often
let

course
entered
his

took
possession

it
for

the
object
of
this
ceremony
was
as
we
know
to
counteract
the
effects
of
the
embalming

to
restore
activity

purified
it

by

as

slaughterers
had
despatched
the
bull
of

cut
it
in

the
priest
seized
the
bleeding
haunch

raised
it
to
the
lips
of
the
mask
as
if
to
invite
it
to
eat
but
the
lips
still
remained
closed
and
refused
to
perform
their
office

then
touched
them

was
situated
in
the
centre
of

one
of
the
richest
funerary
quarters
of
thebes
there
is
really
only
one
complete
description
of
a
cemetery
of
the
poor
namely
that
given
by
rhind
mariette
caused
extensive
excavations
to
be
made
by
gabet
and
vassalli
in
the
assassif
near
the
spot
worked
by
rhind
and
the
objects
found
are
now
in
the
gîzeh
museum
but
the
accounts
of
the
work
are
among
his
unpublished
papers
vassalli
assures
me
that
he
sometimes
found
the
mummies
piled
one
on
another
to
the
depth
of
sixty
bodies
and
even
then
he
did
not
reach
the
lowest
of
the
pile
the
hurried
excavations
which
i
made
in
and
appeared
to
confirm
these
statements
of
rhind
and
vassalli
yawning
trenches
stood
ever
open
there
ready
to
receive
their
prey
the
rites
were
hurriedly
performed
and
the
covered
the
mummies
of
the
burial
with
a
little
sand
out
of
which
we
receive
them
intact

isolated
sometimes
in
groups
of

or
threes

that
they
had
not

been
placed

regular

some
are
wrapped
only
in
bandages
of
coarse
linen

been
consigned
without

covering

while
others
have
been
bound
round

the
dead

was
true

all
ranks
of
society

by
the
sacerdotal
colleges
of
the
royal
chapels
and
followed
by
the
priestly
bodies
to
whom
was
entrusted
the
care
of
the
tombs

the
various
sections

the
most
influential
of
whom
confined
their
attentions
to
the
old

find
on

the
persons
connected
with

for

considered
as
magistrates

as
a
tribunal
it
was
their
duty
to
keep
up
the
monuments
of
the
kings
and
also
of
private
individuals
to
clean
the
tombs
to
visit
the
funerary
chambers
to
note
the
condition
of
their
occupants
and
if
necessary
repair
the
damage
done
by

and
to
provide
on
certain
days
the

prescribed
by
custom
or
by
clauses
in
the
contract
drawn
up
between
the
family
of
the
deceased
and
the
religious
authorities
the
titles
of
these
officials
indicated
how
humble
was
their
position
in
relation
to
the
deified
ancestors
in
whose
service
they
were
employed
they
called
themselves
the
of
the
true
place
and
their
chiefs

of
the
servants
but
all
the

they
were

after
five

six
centuries
of
continuous
homage
had
come
to
be
considered
as
the
patrons
of
khafîtnîbûs
but
this
devotion
was
not
to
the
depreciation
of
other
sovereigns
it
is
true
that
the
officials
were
not
always
clear
as
to
the
identity
of
the
royal
remains
of
which
they
had
the
care
and
they
were
known
to
have
changed
one
of
their
queens

the
sculptors
and
the

were
grouped
into

many
of
them
spent
their
days
in
the
tombs
they
were
decorating
while
others
had
their
workshops
probably
very
like
those
of
our
modern
monumental
masons
we
gather
this
from
the
inscriptions
which
give
us
the
various
titles
of
the
sculptors
draughtsmen
or
workmen
but
i
have
been
unable
to
make
out
the
respective
positions
held
by
these
different
persons

kept
at
the
disposal
of
their
needy
customers
an
assortment
of
statues

at
the

a
considerable
number
of
these
unfinished

and
stelæ
coming
from
the
workshops
of
the
necropolis
these
artisans
made
the
greater
part
of
their
livelihood
by
means
of
these
epitaphs
and
the
majority
thought
only
of
selling
as
many
of
them
as
they
could
some
few
however
devoted
themselves
to
work
of
a
higher
kind
sculpture
had
reached
a
high
degree
of
development
under
the
thûtmoses
and
the
ramses
and
the
art
of
depicting
scenes
in
had
been
brought
to
a
perfection
hitherto
unknown
this
will
be
easily
seen
by
comparing
the
pictures
in
the
old
mastabas
such
as
those
of
ti
or
phtahhotpû
with
the
finest
parts
of
the
temples

for
models
in

own
schools
of
the
highest
types
which
egyptian
art
could
produce
at
its
best
in
this
particular
branch
the
drawing
is
freer
than
in
earlier
examples
the
action
is
more
natural
the
composition
more
studied
and
the
perspective
less
wild
we
feel
that
the
artist
handled
his
subject
he
spared
no
trouble
in
sketching
out
his
designs
and
in
making
studies
from
nature
and
as
papyrus
was
expensive
he
drew
rough
drafts
or
made
notes
of
his
impressions
on
the
flat
chips
of
limestone

which
the
workshops
were
strewn

could
rival
these

for
boldness

freedom
in
execution
whether
it
were
in
the
portrayal
of
the
majestic
gait
of
a
king
or
the
agility
of
an
acrobat
of
the
latter
we
have
an
example
in
the

museum
the
girl
is
nude
with
the
exception
of
a
tightly
fitting
belt
about
her
hips
and
she
is
throwing
herself
backwards
with
so
natural
a
motion
that
we
are
almost
tempted
to
expect
her
to
turn
a
somersault
and
fall
once
more
into
position
with
her
heels
together

unfinished
figures
on

with
what
a
steady
hand
the
clever
draughtsman
could
sketch
out
his
subjects
the
head
from
the
nape
of
the
neck

the
articles
of
apparel
and
ornaments
sketched
rapidly
at
first
had
to
be
gone
over
again

count
the
tresses

hair

sculptor
drawn

from
photographs
by

and
daniel
héron
when
the
draughtsman
had
finished
his
picture
from
the
sketch
which
he
had
made
or
when
he
had
enlarged
it
from
a
smaller
drawing
the
master
of
the
studio
would
go
over
it
again
marking
here
and
there
in
red
the
defective
points
to
which
the
sculptor
gave
his
attention
when
working
the
subject
out
on
the
wall
if
he
happened
to
make
a
mistake
in
executing
it
he
corrected
it
as
well
as
he
was
able
by
filling
up
with
stucco
or
hard
cement
the
portions
to
be
remodelled
and
by
starting
to
work
again
upon
the
fresh
surface
this
cement
has
fallen
out
in
some
cases
and
reveals
to
our
eyes
the
marks
of
the
underlying
chiselling
there
are
for
example
two
profiles
of
seti
on
one
of
the
of
the
hypostyle
hall
at
karnak
one
faintly
outlined
and
the
other
standing
fully
out
from
the
surface
of
the
stone
the
sense
of
the
picturesque
was
making
itself
felt
and
artists
were
no
longer
to
be
excused
for
neglecting
architectural
details
the
configuration
of
the
country
the
drawing
of
rare
plants
and
in
fact
all
those
accessories
which
had
been
previously
omitted
altogether
or
merely
indicated
the
necessity
of
covering
such
vast
surfaces
as
the
pylons
offered
had
accustomed
them
to
arrange
the
various
scenes
of
one
and
the
same
action
in
a
more
natural
and
intimate
connexion
than
their
predecessors
could
possibly
have
done
in
these
scenes
the
pharaoh
naturally
played
the
chief
part
but
in
place
of
choosing
for
treatment
merely
one
or
other
important
action
of
the
monarch
calculated
to
exhibit
his
courage
the
artist
endeavoured
to
portray
all
the
successive
incidents
in
his
campaigns
in
the
same
manner
as
the
early
italian
painters
were
accustomed
to
depict
one
after
the
other
and
on
the
same
canvas
all
the
events
of
the
same
legend
the
details
of
these
gigantic
compositions
may
sometimes
appear
childish
to
us
and
we
may
frequently
be
at
a
loss
in
determining
the
relations
of
the
parts
yet
the
whole
is
full
of
movement
and
although
mutilated
gives
us
even
yet
the
impression
which
would
have
been
made
upon
us
by
the
turmoil
of
a
battle
in
those
distant
days
the
sculptor
of
statues
for
a
long
time
past
was
not
a
whit
less
skilful
than
the
artist
who
executed
the
sculptor
was
doubtless
often
obliged
to
give
enormous
proportions
to
the
figure
of
the
king
to
prevent
his
being
overshadowed
by
the
mass
of
buildings
among
which
the
statue
was
to
appear
but
this
necessity
of
exaggerating
the
human
form
did
not
destroy
in
the
artist
that
sense
of
proportion
and
that
skilful
handling
of
the
chisel
which
are
so
strikingly
displayed
in
the
sitting
scribe
or
in
the
princess
at
meîdûm
it
merely
trained
him
to
mark
out
deftly
the
principal
lines
and
to
calculate
the
volume
and
dimensions
of
these
gigantic
granite
figures
of
some
fifty
to
feet
high
with
as
great
confidence
and
skill
as
he
would
have
employed
upon
any
statue
of
ordinary
dimensions
which
might
be
entrusted
to
him
the
colossal
statues
at
and
thebes
still
witness
to
the
incomparable
skill
of
the
theban
sculptors
in
the
difficult
art
of
imagining
and
executing
superhuman
types
the
decadence
of
egyptian
art
did
not
begin
until
the
time
of
ramses
but
its
downward
progress
was
rapid
and
the
statues
of
the
ramesside
period
are
of
little
or
no
artistic
value
the
form
of
these
figures
is
poor
the
technique
crude
and

specimens
of

accounted

the

who
made
up
the

had
aspirations
for

full
of

there
was
also

crawled

the

were
accustomed
to
dedicate

which
witnessed

and
i
was
in

day
and
night
i
lay
groaning
on
my
couch
like
a

in

and
i
made
supplication
to
the

it
did
not

down
by
the
summit
of
the
west
the
brave
one
among
all
the
gods
and
all
the
goddesses
of
the
city
so
i
would
say
to
all
the
miserable
sinners
among
the
people
of
the
necropolis
heed
to
the
summit
for
there
is
a
lion
in
the
summit

she
strikes
as
strikes

she
pursues
him
who
sins
against

invoked

i

that
she
flew
to
me

she
placed
herself
upon
me

made
me
recognise
her
hand
and
appeased

returned
to

delivered
me
from
suffering
for
she

she

appeased

did
not
put
their

keep

crimes
against
the
dead
were
always
common
every
penniless
fellow
knew
what
quantities
of
gold
and
jewels
had
been
entombed
with
the
departed
and
these
treasures
scattered
around
them
at
only
a
few
feet
from
the
surface
of
the
ground
presented
to
them
a
constant
temptation
to
which
they
often
succumbed
some
were
not
disposed
to
have
accomplices
while
others
associated
together
and
having
purchased
at
a
serious
cost
the
connivance
of
the
custodians
set
boldly
to
work
on
tombs
both
recent
and
ancient
not
content
with
stealing
the
funerary
furniture
which
they
disposed
of
to
the
undertakers
they
stripped
the
mummies
also
and
smashed
the
bodies
in
their
efforts
to
secure
the
jewels
then
putting
the
remains
together
again
they
rearranged
the
mummies
afresh
so
cleverly
that
they
can
no
longer
be
distinguished
by
their
outward
appearance
from
the
originals
and
the
first
wrappings
must
be
removed
before
the
fraud
can
be
discovered
from
time
to
time
one
of
these
rogues
would
allow
himself
to
be
taken
for
the
purpose
of
denouncing
his
comrades
and
avenging
himself
for
the
injustice
of
which
he
was
the
victim
in
the
division
of
the
spoil
he
was
laid
hold
of
by
the
mazaîû
and
brought
before
the
tribunal
of
justice
the
lands
situated
on
the
left
bank
of
the
nile
belonged
partly
to
the
king
and
partly
to
the
god
amon
and
any
infraction
of
the
law
in
regard
to
the
necropolis
was
almost
certain
to
come
within
the
jurisdiction
of
one
or
other
of
them
the
commission
appointed
therefore
to
determine
the
damage
done
in
any
case
included
in
many
instances
the
high
priest
or
his
delegates
as
well
as
the
officers
of
the
pharaoh
the
office
of
this
commission
was
to
examine
into
the
state
of
the
tombs
to
interrogate
the
witnesses
and
the
accused
applying
the
torture
if
necessary
when
they
had
got
at
the
facts
the
tribunal
of
the
notables
condemned
to
impalement
some
half
a
dozen
of
the
poor
wretches
and
caused
some
score
of
others
to
be
whipped
but
when
two
or
three
months
had
elapsed
the
remembrance
of
the
punishment
began
to
die
away
and
the
depredations
began
afresh
the
low
rate
of
wages
occasioned
at
fixed
periods
outbursts
of
discontent
and
trouble
which
ended
in
actual
disturbances
the
rations
allowed
to
each
workman
and
given
to
him
at
the
beginning
of
each
month
would
possibly
have
been
sufficient
for
himself
and
his
family
but
owing
to
the
usual
lack
of
foresight
in
the
egyptian
they
were
often
consumed
long
before
the
time
fixed
and
the
pinch
soon
began
to
be
felt
the
workmen
demoralised
by
their
involuntary
abstinence
were
not
slow
to
turn
to
the
overseer
are
perishing
of
hunger
and
there
are
still
eighteen
days
before
the
next
the
latter
was
prodigal
of
fair
speeches
but
as
his
words
were
rarely
accompanied
by
deeds
the
workmen
would
not
listen
to
him
they
stopped
work
left
the
workshop
in
turbulent
crowds
ran
with
noisy
demonstrations
to
some
public
place
to
hold
a
meeting
perhaps
the
nearest
monument
at
the
gate
of
the
temple
of
thûtmosis
behind
the
chapel
of
mînephtah
or
in
the
court
of
that
of
seti
i
this
is
how
i
translate
a
fairly
common
expression
which
means
literally
be
put
on
the
spiegelberg
sees
in
this
only
a
method
of
administering
torture
perhaps
the
chapel
of
uazmôsû
or
possibly
the
free
space
before
the
temple
of
deîr
the
site
of
this
chapel
was
discovered
by
petrie
in
the
spring
of
it
had
previously
been
supposed
to
be
a
temple
of
amenôthes
iii
their
overseers
followed
them
the
police
commissioners
of
the
locality
the
mazaîû
and
the
scribes
mingled
with
them
and
addressed
themselves
to
some
of
the
leaders
with
whom
they
might
be
acquainted
but
these
would
not
at
first
give
them
a
hearing
will
not
return
they
would
say
to
the
peacemakers
it
clear
to
your
superiors
down
below
it
must
have
been
manifest
that
from
their
point
of
view
their
complaints
were
well
founded
and
the
official
who
afterwards
gave
an
account
of
the
affair
to
the
authorities
was
persuaded
of
this
went
to
hear
them
and
they
spoke
true
words
to
for
the
most
part
these
strikes
had
no
other
consequence
than
a
prolonged
stoppage
of
work
until
the
distribution
of
rations
at
the
beginning
of
the
next
month
gave
the
malcontents
courage
to
return
to
their
tasks
attempts
were
made
to
prevent
the
recurrence
of
these
troubles
by
changing
the
method
and
time
of
payments
these
were
reduced
to
an
interval
of
fifteen
days
and
at
length
indeed
to
one
of
eight
the
result
was
very
much
the
same
as
before
the
workman
paid
more
frequently
did
not
on
that
account
become
more
prudent
and
the
hours
of
labour
lost
did
not
decrease
the
individual
man
if
he
had
had
nobody
to
consider
but
himself
might
have
put
up
with
the
hardships
of
his
situation
but
there
were
almost
always
wife
and
children
or
sisters
concerned
who
clamoured
for
bread
in
their
hunger
and
all
the
while
the
storehouses
of
the
temples
or
those
of
the
state
close
by
were
filled
to
overflowing
with
durrah
barley
and
wheat
khonsu
for
example
excites
his
comrades
to
pillage
the
storehouses
of
the
gate
the
temptation
to
break
open
the
doors
and
to
help
themselves
in
the
present
necessity
must
have
been
keenly
felt
some
bold
spirits
among
the
strikers
having
set
out
together
scaled
the
two
or
three
boundary
walls
by
which
the
granaries
were
protected
but
having
reached
this
position
their
hearts
failed
them
and
they
contented
themselves
with
sending
to
the
chief
custodian
an
eloquent
pleader
to
lay
before
him
their
very
humble
request
are
come
urged
by
famine
urged
by
thirst
having
no
more
linen
no
more
oil
no
more
fish
no
more
vegetables
send
to
pharaoh
our
master
send
to
the
king
our
lord
that
he
may
provide
us
with
the
necessaries
of
if
one
of
them
with
less
was
so
carried
away
as
to
let
drop
an
oath
which
was
a
capital
offence
saying
amon
by
the
sovereign
whose
anger
is
death
if
he
asked
to
be
taken
before
a
magistrate
in
order
that
he
might
reiterate
there
his
complaint
the
others
interceded
for
him
and
begged
that
he
might
escape
the
punishment
fixed
by
the
law
for
blasphemy
the
scribe
good
fellow
as
he
was
closed
his
ears
to
the
oath
and
if
it
were
in
his
power
made
a
beginning
of
satisfying
their
demands
by
drawing
upon
the
excess
of
past
months
to
such
an
extent
as
would
pacify
them
for
some
days
and
by
paying
them
a
supplemental
wage
in
the
name
of
the
pharaoh
they
cried
out
loudly
there
not
be
served
out
to
us
corn
in
excess
of
that
which
has
been
distributed
to
us
if
not
we
will
not
stir
from
this
spot
at
length
the
end
of
the
month
arrived
and
they
all
appeared
together
before
the
magistrates
when
they
said
the
scribe
khâmoîsît
who
is
accountable
be
sent
for
he
was
thereupon
brought
before
the
notables
of
the
town
and
they
said
to
him
to
the
corn
which
thou
hast
received
and
give
some
of
it
to
the
people
of
the
pmontunîboîsît
was
then
sent
for
and
of
wheat
were
given
to
us
famine
was
not
caused
only
by
the
thriftlessness
of
the
multitude
administrators
of
all
ranks
did
not
hesitate
to
appropriate
each
one
according
to
his
position
a
portion
of
the
means
entrusted
to
them
for
the
maintenance
of
their
subordinates
and
the
latter
often
received
only
instalments
of
what
was
due
to
them
the
culprits
often
escaped
from
their
difficulties
by
either
laying
hold
of
half
a
dozen
of
their
brawling
victims
or
by
yielding
to
them
a
proportion
of
their
gains
before
a
rumour
of
the
outbreak
could
reach
it
happened
from
time
to
time
however
when
the
complaints
against
them
were
either
too
serious
or
too
frequent
that
they
were
deprived
of
their
functions
cited
before
the
tribunals
and
condemned
what
took
place
at
thebes
was
repeated
with
some
variations
in
each
of
the
other
large
cities
corruption
theft
and
extortion
had
prevailed
among
the
officials
from
time
immemorial
and
the
most
active
kings
alone
were
able
to
repress
these
abuses
or
confine
them
within
narrow
limits
as
soon
as
discipline
became
relaxed
however
they
began
to
appear
again
and
we
have
no
more
convincing
proof
of
the
state
of
decadence
into
which
thebes
had
fallen
towards
the
middle
of
the
xxth
dynasty
than
the
audacity
of
the
crimes
committed
in
the
necropolis
during
the
reigns
of
the
successors
of
ramses
iii
the
priesthood
of
amon
alone
displayed
any
vigour
and
enjoyed
any
prosperity
in
the
general
decline
after
the
victory
of
the
god
over
the
heretic
kings
no
one
dared
to
dispute
his
supremacy
and
the
ramessides
displayed
a
devout
humility
before
him
and
his
ministers
henceforward
he
became
united
to
râ
in
a
definite
manner
and
his
authority
not
only
extended
over
the
whole
of
the
land
of
egypt
but
over
all
the
countries
also
which
were
brought
within
her
influence
so
that
while
pharaoh
continued
to
be
the
greatest
of
kings
god
held
a
position
of
undivided
supremacy
among
the
deities
he
was
the
chief
of
the
two
bnneads
the
heliopolitan
and
the
hermopolitan
and
displayed
for
the
latter
a
special
affection
for
the
vague
character
of
its
eight
secondary
deities
only
served
to
accentuate
the
position
of
the
ninth
and
principal
divinity
with
whose
primacy
that
of
amon
was
identified
it
was
more
easy
to
attribute
to
amon
the
entire
work
of
creation
when
shû
sibû
osiris
and
sit
had
been
excluded
the
deities
whom
the
theologians
of
heliopolis
had
been
accustomed
to
associate
with
the
demiurge
and
in
the
hymns
which
they
sang
at
his
solemn
festivals
they
did
not
hesitate
to
ascribe
to
him
all
the
acts
which
the
priests
of
former
times
had
assigned

development

solar

the
idea
of

god

continued
to
prevail
more
and
more
throughout
egypt
not
indeed
among
the
lower
classes

persisted
in
the
worship
of
their
genii
and
their
animals
but
among
the
royal
family
the
priests
the
nobles
and

of
culture
the
latter
believed
that
the
had
at
length
absorbed
all
the
various
beings
who
had
been
manifested
in
the
feudal
divinities

had
surrendered
their
original
characteristics
in
order
to
become
forms
of
the
sun
amon
as
well
as
the
others
and
the
new
belief
displayed
itself
in
magnifying
the
solar
deity

the
solar
deity
united
with
the
theban
amon
that
is
the
omnipotence
of
this
one
god
did
not
however
exclude
a
belief
in
the
existence
of
his
compeers
the
theologians
thought
all
the
while
that
the
beings
to
whom
ancient
generations
had
accorded
a
complete
independence
in
respect
of
their
rivals
were
nothing
more
than
emanations
from
one
supreme
being
if
local
pride
forced
them
to
apply
to
this
single
deity
the
designation
customarily
used
in
their
city
phtah
at
memphis
at
thinis
khnûmû
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
first
cataract

were
quite
willing
to
allow
at

time
that
these
appellations
were
but
various
masks

unique

in
his
names
and
mighty

to
the
importance

he
was
worshipped

amon
lord
of
the
capital

patron
of
the
dynasty
having
more
partisans
enjoyed
more
respect

in
a
word
felt
himself
possessed
of
more
claims

be
the
sole
god
of
egypt
than
his
brethren

could
not
claim
so
many
worshippers
he
did
not
at
the
outset
arrogate
to
himself
the
same
empire
over
the
dead
as
he
exercised
over
the
living
he
had
delegated
his
functions
in
this
respect
to
a
goddess

the
poorer
inhabitants

entertained
a
persistent
devotion

afterwards
blended

from
the
xith

had
adopted
along

no
different
concept
of

from
that
entertained
by
the
inhabitants
of

most
ancient

ascribed
to

to
examine
more
closely

to
eliminate
from
them
anything
which
might

supreme

him
concerning
the
hidden
mysteries
of
that
obscure
half
of
the
world
in
which
the
sun
dwelt
between
daylight
and
daylight
teaching
him
also
how
to
make
friends
and

of
the
benevolent
genii
and
how
to
avoid

defeat
the
monsters
whom
he
would
encounter
the
best
known
of
the
books
relating
to
these
mysteries
contained
a
geographical
description
of
the
future
world
as
it
was
described
by
the
theban
priests
towards
the
end
of
the
ramesside
period
it
was
in
fact
an
itinerary
in
which
was
depicted
each
separate
region
of
the
underworld
with
its
gates
buildings
and
inhabitants
the
monumental
text
of
this
book
is
found
sculptured
on
a
certain
number
of
the
tombs
of
the
theban
kings
it
was
first
translated
into
english
by
birch
then
into
french
by
dévéria
and
by
maspero
the
account
of
it
given
by
the
egyptian
theologians
did
not
exhibit
much
inventive
genius
they
had
started
with
the
theory
that
the
sun
after
setting
exactly
west
of
thebes
rose
again
due
east
of
the
city
and
they
therefore
placed
in
the
dark
hemisphere
all
the
regions
of
the
universe
which
lay
to
the
north
of
those
two
points
of
the
compass
the
first
stage
of
the
journey
after
disappearing
below
the
horizon
coincided
with
the
period
of
twilight
the
orb
travelled
along
the
open
sky
diminishing
the
brightness
of
his
fires
as
he
climbed
northward
and
did
not
actually
enter
the
underworld
till
he
reached
abydos
close
to
the
spot
where
at
the
of
the
cleft
the
souls
of
the
faithful
awaited
him
as
soon
as
he
had
received
them
into
his
boat
he
plunged
into
the
tunnel
which
there
pierces
the
mountains
and
the
cities
through
which
he
first
passed
between
abydos
and
the
fayûm
were
known
as
the
osirian
fiefs
he
continued
his
journey
through
them
for
the
space
of
two
hours
receiving
the
homage
of
the
inhabitants
and
putting
such
of
the
shades
on
shore
as
were
predestined
by
their
special
devotion
for
the
osiris
of
abydos
and
his
associates
horus
and
anubis
to
establish
themselves
in
this
territory
beyond
heracleopolis
he
entered
the
domains
of
the
memphite
gods
the
of
sokaris
and
this
probably
was
the
most
perilous
moment
of
his
journey
illustration
one
of
the
mysterious
books
of
amon
the
feudatories
of
phtah
were
gathered
together
in
grottoes
connected
by
a
labyrinth
of
narrow
passages
through
which
even
the
most
fully
initiated
were
scarcely
able
to
find
their
way
the
luminous
boat
instead
of
venturing
within
these
catacombs
passed
above
them
by
mysterious
tracks
the
crew
were
unable
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
sovereign
through
whose
realm
they
journeyed
and
they
in
like
manner
were
invisible
to
him
he
could
only
hear
the
voices
of
the
divine
sailors
and
he
answered
them
from
the
depth
of
the
darkness
two
hours
were
spent
in
this
obscure
passage
after
which
navigation
became
easier
as
the
vessel
entered
the
nomes

to
the
osirises

four
consecutive
hours
of
sailing
brought
the
bark
from
the
province
in
which
the
four
principal
bodies
of
the
god
slept
to
that
in
which
his
four
souls
kept
watch
and
as
it
passed
it
illuminated
the
eight
circles
reserved
for
men
and
kings
who
worshipped
the
god
of
mendes
from
the
tenth
hour
onwards
it
directed
its
course
due
south
and
passed
through
the
aûgàrît
the
place
of
fire
and
abysmal
waters
to
which
the
heliopolitans
consigned
the
souls
of
the
impious
then
finally
quitting
the
tunnel
it
soared

blush

each
of

ordinary
dead
was

particular
hour

twelve
which
belonged
to
the
god
of
his
choice
or
of
his
native
town
left
to
dwell
there
they
suffered
no
absolute
torment
but
languished
in
the
darkness
in
a
kind
of
painful
torpor
from
which
condition
the
approach
of
the
bark
alone
was
able
to
rouse
them
they
hailed
its
daily
coming
with
acclamations
and
felt
new
life
during
the
hour
in
which
its
rays
fell
on
them
breaking
out
into
lamentations
as
the
bark
passed
away
and
the
light
disappeared
with
it
the
souls
who
were
devotees
of
the
sun
escaped
this
melancholy
existence
they
escorted
the
god
reduced
though
he
was
to
a
mummied
corpse
on
his
nightly
cruise
and
were
piloted
by
him
safe
and
sound
to
meet
the
first
streaks
of
the
new
day
as
the
boat
issued
from
the
mountain
in
the
morning
between
the
two
trees
which
flanked
the
gate
of
the
east
these
souls
had
their
choice
of
several
ways
of
spending
the
day
on
which
they
were
about
to
enter
they
might
join
their
risen
god
in
his
course
through
the
hours
of
light
and
assist
him
in
combating
apophis

his
accomplices

again

having

for

moment
quitted

one
of
the
hours
of
the
night
they
might
on
the
other
hand
leave
him
and
once
more
enter
the
world
of
the
living
settling
themselves
where
they
would
but
always
by
preference
in
the
tombs
where
their
bodies
awaited
them
and
where
they
could
enjoy
the
wealth
which
had
been
accumulated
there
they
might
walk
within
their
garden
and
sit
beneath
the
trees
they
had
planted
they
could
enjoy
the
open
air
beside
the
pond
they
had
dug
and
breathe
the
gentle
north
breeze
on
its
banks
after
the
midday
heat
until
the
time
when
the
returning
evening
obliged
them
to
repair
once
more
to
abydos
and
with
the
god
in
order
to
pass
the
anxious
vigils
of
the
night
under
his
protection
thus
from
the
earliest
period
of
egyptian
history
the
life
beyond
the
tomb
was
an
eclectic
one
made
up
of
a
series
of
earthly
enjoyments
combined
together
the
pharaohs
had
enrolled
themselves
instinctively
among
the
most
ardent
votaries
of
this
complex
doctrine
their
relationship
to
the
sun
made
its
adoption
a
duty
and
its
profession
was
originally
perhaps
one
of
the
privileges
of
their
position
râ
invited
them
on
board
because
they
were
his
children
subsequently
extending
this
favour
to
those
whom
they
should
deem
worthy
to
be
associated
with
them
and
thus
become
companions
of
the
ancient
deceased
kings
of
upper
and
lower
egypt
this
is
apparently
what
we
gather
from
the
picture
inserted
in
chapter
xvii
of
the
of
the
dead
where
we
see
the
kings
of
upper
and
lower
egypt
guiding
the
divine
bark
and
the
deceased
with
them
the
idea
which
the
egyptians
thus
formed
of
the
other
world
and
of
the
life
of
the
initiated
within
it
reacted
gradually
on
their
concept
of
the
tomb
and
of
its
befitting
decoration
they
began
to
consider
the
entrances
to
the
pyramid
and
its
internal
passages
and
chambers
as
a
conventional
representation
of
the
gates
passages
and
halls
of
hades
itself
when
the
pyramid
passed
out
of
fashion
and
they
had
replaced
it
by
a
tomb
cut
in
the
rock
in
one
or
other
of
the
branches
of
the
bab
valley
the
plan
of
construction
which
they
chose
was
an
exact
copy
of
that
employed
by
the
memphites
and
earlier
thebans
and
they
hollowed
out
for
themselves
in
the
a
on
the
same
lines
as
those
formerly
employed
within
the
pyramidal
structure
the
relative
positions
of
the
tunnelled
tombs
along
the
valley
were
not
determined
by
any
order
of
rank
or
of
succession
to
the
throne
each
pharaoh
after
ramses
set
to
work
on
that
part
of
the
rock
where
the
character
of
the
stone
favoured
his
purpose
and
displayed
so
little
respect
for
his
predecessors
that
the
workmen
after
having
tunnelled
a
gallery
were
often
obliged
to
abandon
it
altogether
or
to
change
the
direction
of
their
excavations
so
as
to
avoid
piercing
a
neighbouring
tomb
the
design
was
usually
a
mere
project
which
could
be
modified
at
will
and
which
he
did
not
feel
bound
to
carry
out
with
fidelity
the
actual
measurements
of
the
tomb
of
ramses
iv
are
almost
everywhere
at
variance
with
the
numbers
and
arrangement
of
the
working
drawing
of
it
which
has
been
preserved
to
us
in
a
papyrus
the
general
disposition
of
the
royal
tombs
however
is
far
from
being
complicated
we
have
at
the
entrance
the
rectangular
door
usually
surmounted
by
the
sun
represented
by
a
yellow
disk
before
which
the
sovereign
kneels
with
his
hands
raised
in
the
posture
of
adoration
this
gave
access
to
a
passage
sloping
gently
downwards
and
broken
here
and
there
by
a
level
landing
and
steps
leading
to
a
first
chamber
of
varying
amplitude
at
the
further
end
of
which
a
second
passage
opened
which
descended
to
one
or
more
apartments
the
last
of
which
contained
the
coffin
the
oldest
present
some
noteworthy
exceptions
to
this
plan
particularly
those
of
seti
and
ramses
iii
but
from
the
time
of
ramses
there
is
no
difference
to
be
remarked
in
them
except
in
the
degree
of
finish
of
the
or
in
the
length
of
the
passages
the
shortest
of
the
latter
extends
some
feet
into
the
rock
while
the
longest
never
exceeds
three
hundred
and
ninety
feet
the
same
artifices
which
had
been
used
by
the
to
defeat
the
designs
of
robbers
false
painted
and
sculptured
walls
built
across
passages
stairs
concealed
under
a
movable
stone
in
the
corner
of
a
chamber
were
also
employed
by
the
theban
engineers
the
decoration
of
the
walls
was
suggested
as
in
earlier
times
by
the
needs
of
the
royal
soul
with
this
difference
that
the
thebans
set
themselves
to
render
visible
to
his
eyes
by
paintings
that
which
the
memphites
had
been
content
to
present
to
his
intelligence
in
writing
so
that
the
pharaoh
could
now
see
what
his
ancestors
had
been
able
merely
to
read
on
the
walls
of
their
tombs
where
the
inscribed
texts
in
the
of
unas
state
that
unas
incarnate
in
the
sun

thus
representing
osiris

over

waters

high

to
the

the
place
of
the
god
in
the
solar
bark
and
in
the
fields

where
the
walls
of
unas
bear
only
the
prayers
recited
over
the
mummy
for
the
opening
of
his
mouth
for
the
restoration
of
the
use
of
his
limbs
for
his
clothing

and
nourishment
we
see
depicted
on
those
of
seti
or
ramses
iv
the
mummies
of
these
kings
and
the
statues
of
their
doubles
in
the
hands
of
the
priests
who
are
portrayed
in
the
performance
of
these
various
offices
the
starry
ceilings
of
the
pyramids
reproduce
the
aspect
of
the
sky
but
without
giving
the
names
of
the
stars
on
the
ceilings
of
some
of
the
ramesside
on
the
other
hand
the
constellations
are
represented
each
with
its
proper
figure
while
astronomical
tables
give
the
position
of
the
heavenly
bodies
at
intervals
of
fifteen
days
so
that
the
soul
could
tell
at
a
glance
into
what
region
of
the
firmament
the
course
of
the
bark
would
bring
him
each
night
in
the
earlier
ramesside
tombs
under
seti
and
ramses
the
execution
of
these
subjects
shows
evidence
of
a
care
and
skill
which
are
quite
marvellous
and
both
figures
and
hieroglyphics
betray
the
hand
of
accomplished
artists
but
in
the
tomb
of
ramses
iii
the
work
has
already
begun
to
show
signs
of
inferiority
and
the
majority
of
the
scenes
are
coloured
in
a
very
summary
fashion
a
raw
yellow
predominates
and
the
tones
of
the
reds
and
blues
remind
us
of
a
first
efforts
at
painting
this
decline
is
even
more
marked
under
the
succeeding
ramessides
the
drawing
has
deteriorated
the
tints
have
become
more
and
more
crude
and
the
latest
paintings
seem
but
a
lamentable
caricature
of
the
earlier
ones
the
courtiers
and
all
those
connected
with
the
worship
of
priests
prophets
singers
and
functionaries
connected
with
the
necropolis
shared
the
same
belief
with
regard
to
the
future
world
as
their
sovereign
and
they
carried
their
faith
in
the
power
to
the
point
of
identifying
themselves
with
him
after
death
and
of
substituting
the
name
of
râ
for
that
of
osiris
they
either
did
not
venture
however
to
go
further
than
this
or
were
unable
to
introduce
into
their
tombs
all
that
we
find
in
the
bab
they
confined
themselves
to
writing
briefly
on
their
own
coffins
or
confiding
to
the
mummies
of
their
in
addition
to
the
of
the
dead
a
copy
of
the
of
knowing
what
there
is
in
hades
or
of
some
other
mystic
writing
which
was
in
harmony
with
their
creed
hastily
prepared
copies
of
these
were
sold
by
unscrupulous
scribes
often
badly
written
and
almost
always
incomplete
in
which
were
hurriedly
set
down
haphazard
the
episodes
of
the
course
of
the
sun
with
explanatory
illustrations
the
representations
of
the
gods
in
them
are
but
little
better
than
caricatures
the
text
is
full
of
faults
and
scarcely
decipherable
and
it
is
at
times
difficult
to
recognize
the
correspondence
of
the
scenes
and
prayers
with
those
in
the
royal
tombs
although
amon
had
become
the
supreme
god
at
least
for
this
class
of
the
initiated
he
was
by
no
means
the
sole
deity
worshipped
by
the
egyptians
the
other
divinities
previously
associated
with
him
still
held
their
own
beside
him
or
were
further
defined
and
invested
with
a
more
decided
personality
the
goddess
regarded
as
his
partner

at
first
represented
as
childless
in
spite
of
the
name
of
maût
or
mût
the
mother
by
which
she
was
invoked
and
amon
was
supposed
to
have
adopted
montû
the
god
of
hermonthis
in
order
to
complete
his
triad
montû
however
formerly
the
sovereign
of
the
theban
plain
and
lord
over
amon
himself
was
of
too
exalted
a
rank
to
play

the
priests
were
therefore
obliged
to
fall
back
upon
a
personage
of
lesser
importance
named
khonsû
who
up
to
that
period
had
been
relegated
to
an
obscure
position
in
the
celestial
hierarchy
how
they
came
to
identify
him
with
the
moon
and
subsequently
with
osiris
and
thot
is
as
yet
unexplained
but
the
assimilation
had
taken
place
before
the
xixth
dynasty
drew
to
its
close
khonsû
thus
honoured
soon
became
a
favourite
deity
with
both
the
people
and
the
upper
classes
at
first
merely
supplementing
montû
but
finally
supplanting
him
in

third
place

the
time
of
sesostris
onwards
theban
dogma
acknowledged
him
alone
side
by
side
with
and
mût
the
divine
mother
it
is
possible
that
this
assimilation
originated
in
the
fact
that
khonsû
is
derived
from
the
verb
to
navigate
khonsû
would
thus
have
been
he
who
crossed
the
heavens

his
bark

which

and
thence
to
the

of

four
long
angular
grooves
run
up
the

to
a
height

about
twenty
feet
from

spliced

by

projected

bamesseum
or
were
constructed
on
similar
lines
even
in
their
condition
there
is
something
oppressive
and
uncanny
in
their
appearance
the
gods
loved
to
shroud
themselves
in
mystery
and
therefore
the
plan
of
the
building
was
so
arranged
as
to
render
the
transition
almost
imperceptible
from
the
blinding
sunlight
outside
to
the
darkness
of
their
retreat

an
appropriate
twilight
the
sanctuary
is
veiled
in
still
deeper
darkness
while
in
the
chambers
beyond
reigns
an
almost
perpetual
night
the
effect
produced
by
this
gradation
of
obscurity
was
intensified
by
constructional
artifices
the
different
parts
of
the
building
are
not
all

rising
as
the

the
difference
of
level
in
the
temple
of

is
not
more
than
five
feet
three
inches

it
is
combined
with
a
still
more
considerable
lowering

an
exception
to
this
rule
this
temple
had
in
the
course

centuries
undergone
so
many
restorations

additions
that
it
formed
a
collection
of
buildings
rather

it
might
have
been
regarded
as
early

the

must
indeed
have
been
enormous
to
have
borne
the
continual
drain
occasioned
by
restoration

the
resources
of
the
god
would
soon
have
been
exhausted
had
not
foreign
wars
continued
to
furnish
him
during
several
centuries
with
all
or
more
than
he
needed
the
gods
had
suffered
severely
in
the
troublous
times
which
had
followed
the
reign
of
seti
and
it
required
all
the
generosity
of
ramses
iii
to
compensate
them
for
the
losses
they
had
sustained
during
the
anarchy
under
arisû
the
spoil
taken
from
the
libyans
from
the
peoples
of
the
sea
and
from
the
hittites
had
flowed
into
the
sacred
treasuries
while
the
able
administration
of
the
sovereign
had
done
the
rest
so
that
on
the
accession
of
ramses
iv
the
temples
were
in
a
more
prosperous
state
than
ever
they
held
as
their
own
property
towns
nine
of
which
were

possessed

that
of

claimed
the
giant
share
of
this
enormous
total
and
of
it
or
more
were
reserved
for
his
use
namely
slaves
head
of
cattle
of
cornland
vineyards
and
orchards
and
egyptian
towns
the
nine
foreign
towns
all
belonged
to
him
and
one
of
them
contained
the
temple
in
which
he
was
worshipped
by
the
syrians
whenever
they
came
to
pay
their
tribute
to
the
representatives
it
was
but
just
that
his
patrimony
should
surpass
that
of
his
compeers
since
the
conquering
pharaohs
owed
their
success
to
him
who
without
the
of
the
other
feudal
deities
had
lavished
victories
upon
them
the
donations
of
ramses
or
rather
the
total
of
the
donations
made
to
the
gods
by
the
predecessors
of
that
pharaoh
and
confirmed
and
augmented
by
him
are
enumerated
at
length
in
the
harris
an
abridgement
of
these
donations
occupies
seven
large
plates
in
the
harris
his
domain
was
at
least
five
times
more
considerable
than
that
of
râ
of
heliopolis
and
ten
times
greater
than
that
of
the
memphite
phtah
and
yet
of
old
in
the
earlier
times
of
history
râ
and
phtah
were
reckoned
the
wealthiest
of
the
egyptian
gods
it
is
easy
to
understand
the
influence
which
a
god
thus
endowed
with
the
goods
of
this
world
exercised
over
men
in
an
age
when
the
national
wars
had
the
same
consequences
for
the
immortals
as
for
their
worshippers
and
when
the
defeat
of
a
people
was
regarded
as
a
proof
of
the
inferiority
of
its
patron
gods
the
most
victorious
divinity
became
necessarily
the
wealthiest
before
whom
all
other
deities
bowed
and
whom
they
as
well
as
their
subjects
were
obliged
to
serve
so
powerful
a
god
as
amon
had
but
few
obstacles
to
surmount
before
becoming
the
national
deity
indeed
he
was
practically
the
foremost
of
the
gods
during
the
ramesside
period
and
was
generally
acknowledged
as
representative
by
all
foreign
nations
his
priests
shared
in
the
prestige
he
enjoyed
and
their
influence
in
state
affairs
increased
proportionately
with
his
power
from
the
xviiith
dynasty
at
least
the
first
prophet
of
amon
had
taken
the
precedence
of
the
high
priests
of
heliopolis
and
memphis
as
is
proved
by
the
position
he
occupies
in
the
egyptian
hierarchy
in
the
the
chief
of
their
hierarchy
however
did
not
bear
the
high
titles
which
in
ancient
times
distinguished
those
of
memphis
and
heliopolis
he
was
content
with
the
humble
appellation
of
first
prophet
of
amon
he
had
for
several
generations
been
nominated
by
the
sovereign
but
he
was
generally
chosen
from
the
families
attached
hereditarily
or
otherwise
to
the
temple
of
karnak
and
must
previously
have
passed
through
every
grade
of
the
priestly
hierarchy
those
who
aspired
to
this
honour
had
to
graduate
as
fathers
this
was
the
first
step
in
the
initiation
and
one
at
which
many
were
content
to
remain
but
the
more
ambitious
or
favoured
advanced
by
successive
stages
to
the
dignity
of
third
and
then
of
second
prophet
before
attaining
to
the
highest
rank
what
we
know
on
this
subject
has
been
brought
to
light
mainly
by
the
inscriptions
on
the
statue
of
at
munich
published
and
commented
on
by
dévéria
and
by
lauth
the
cursus
honorum
of
ramâ
shows
us
that
he
was
first
third
then
second
prophet
of
amon
before
being
raised
to
the
pontificate
in
the
reign
of
mînephtah
the
pharaohs
of
the
xixth
dynasty
jealously
supervised
the
promotions
made
in
the
theban
temples
and
saw
that
none
was
elected
except
him
who
was
devoted
to
their
interests
such
as
for
example
and
unnofri
under
ramses
ii
distinguished
himself
by
his
administrative
qualities
if
he
did
not
actually
make
the
plans
for
the
hypostyle
hall
at
karnak
he
appears
at
least
to
have
superintended
its
execution
and
decoration
he
finished
the
great
pylon
erected
the
obelisks
and
gateways
built
the
or
vessel
of
the
god
and
found
a
further
field
for
his
activity
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
nile
where
he
helped
to
complete
both
the
chapel
at
qurneh
and
also
the
ramesseum
ramses
ii
had
always
been
able
to
make
his
authority
felt
by
the
high
priests
who
succeeded
but
the
pharaohs
who
followed
him
did
not
hold
the
reins
with
such
a
strong
hand
as
early
as
the
reigns
of
mînephtah
and
seti
ii
the
first
prophets
raî
and
ramâ
claimed
the
right
of
building
at
karnak
for
their
own
purposes
and
inscribed
on
the
walls
long
inscriptions
in
which
their
own
panegyrics
took
precedence
of
that
of
the
sovereign
they
even
aspired
to
a
religious
hegemony
and
declared
themselves
to
be
the
of
all
the
prophets
of
the
gods
of
the
south
and
we
do
not
know
what
became
of
them
during
the
usurpation
of
arisû
but
son
of
miribastît
who
filled
the
office
during
the
reign
of
ramses
revived
these
ambitious
projects
as
soon
as
the
state
of
egypt
appeared
to
favour
them
the
king
however
pious
he
might
be
was
not
inclined
to
yield
up
any
of
his
authority
even
though
it
were
to
the
earthly
delegate
of
the
divinity
whom
he
reverenced
before
all
others
the
sons
of
the
pharaoh
were
however
more
accommodating
and
played
his
part
so
well
that
he
succeeded
in
obtaining
from
them
the
reversion
of
the
high
priesthood
for
his
son
amenôthes
the
priestly
office
from
having
been
elective
was
by
this
stroke
suddenly
made
hereditary
in
the
family
the
kings
preserved
it
is
true
the
privilege
of
confirming
the
new
appointment
and
the
nominee
was
not
considered
properly
qualified
until
he
had
received
his
investiture
from
the
sovereign
this
is
proved
by
the
maunier
stele
now
in
the
louvre
it
is
there
related
how
the
high
priest
received
his
investiture
from
the
tanite
king
practically
the
pharaohs
lost
the
power
of
choosing
one
among
the
sons
of
the
deceased
pontiff
they
were
forced
to
enthrone
the
eldest
of
his
survivors
and
legalise
his
accession
by
their
approbation
even
when
they
would
have
preferred
another
it
was
thus
that
a
dynasty
of
vassal
high
priests
came
to
be
established
at
thebes
side
by
side
with
the
royal
dynasty
of
the
pharaohs
the
new
priestly
dynasty
was
not
long
in
making
its
power
felt
in
thebes
and
amenôthes
lived
to
a
great
age
from
the
reign
of
ramses
iii
to
that
of
ramses
at
the
least
they
witnessed
the
accession
of
nine
successive
pharaohs
and
the
unusual
length
of
their
pontificates
no
doubt
increased
the
already
extraordinary
prestige
which
they
enjoyed
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
egypt
it
seemed
as
if
the
god
delighted
to
prolong
the
lives
of
his
representatives
beyond
the
ordinary
limits
while
shortening
those
of
the
temporal
sovereigns
when
the
reigns
of
the
pharaohs
began
once
more
to
reach
their
normal
length
the
authority
of
amenôthes
had
become
so
firmly
established
that
no
human
power
could
withstand
it
and
the
later
ramessides
were
merely
a
set
of
puppet
kings
who
were
ruled
by
him
and
his
successors
not
only
was
there
a
cessation
of
foreign
expeditions
but
the
delta
memphis
and
ethiopia
were
alike
neglected
and
the
only
activity
displayed
by
these
pharaohs
as
far
as
we
can
gather
from
their
monuments
was
confined
to
the
service
of
amon
and
khonsû
at
thebes
the
lack
of
energy
and
independence
in
these
sovereigns
may
not
however
be
altogether
attributable
to
their
feebleness
of
character
it
is
possible
that
they
would
gladly
have
entered
on
a
career
of
conquest
had
they
possessed
the
means
it
is
always
a
perilous
matter
to
allow
the
resources
of
a
country
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
a
priesthood
and
to
place
its
military
forces
at
the
same
time
in
the
hands
of
the
chief
religious
authority
the
warrior
pharaohs
had
always
had
at
their
disposal
the
spoils
obtained
from
foreign
nations
to
make
up
the
deficit
which
their
constant
gifts
to
the
temples
were
making
in
the
treasury
the
sons
of
ramses
on
the
other
hand
had
suspended
all
military
efforts
without
however
lessening
their
lavish
gifts
to
the
gods
and
they
must
in
the
absence
of
the
spoils
of
war
have
drawn
to
a
considerable
extent
upon
the
ordinary
resources
of
the
country
their
successors
therefore
found
the
treasury
impoverished
and
they
would
have

had
they
attempted
to
renew
the
campaigns
or
continue
the
architectural
work
of
their
forefathers
the
priests
of
amon
had
not
as
yet
suffered
materially
from
this
diminution
of
revenue
for
they
possessed
property
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
egypt
but
they
were
obliged
to
restrict
their
expenditure
and
employ
the
sums
formerly
used
for
the
enlarging
of
the
temples
on
the
maintenance
of
their
own
body
meanwhile
public
works
had
been
almost
everywhere
suspended
administrative
discipline
became
relaxed
and
disturbances
with
which
the
police
were
unable
to
cope
were
increasing
in
all
the
important
towns
nothing
is
more
indicative
of
the
state
to
which
egypt
was
reduced
under
the
combined
influence
of
the
priesthood
and
the
ramessides
than
the
thefts
and
pillaging
of
which
the
theban
necropolis
was
then
the
daily
scene
the
robbers
no
longer
confined
themselves
to
plundering
the
tombs
of
private
persons
they
attacked
the
royal
and
their
depredations
were
carried
on
for
years
before
they
were
discovered
in
the
reign
of
ramses
an
inquiry
set
on
foot
by
amenôthes
revealed
the
fact
that
the
tomb
of
sovkûmsaûf
and
his
wife
queen
had
been
rifled
that
those
of
amenôthes
and
of
antuf
iv
had
been
entered
by
tunnelling
and
that
some
dozen
other
royal
tombs
in
the
cemetery
of

were
threatened

the

the

the

the

hrihor
appears
to
have
succeeded
immediately
after
amenôthes
and
his
accession
to
the
pontificate
gave
his
family
a
still
more
exalted
position
in
the
country
as
his
wife
nozmit
was
of
royal
blood
he
assumed
titles
and

to
which
his
father
and
grandfather
had
made
no
claim
he
became
the
of
ethiopia
and
of
the
national
and
foreign
troops
he
engraved
his
name
upon
the
monuments
he
decorated
side
by
side
with
that
of
ramses
xii
in
short
he
possessed
all
the
characteristics
of
a
pharaoh
except
the
crown
and
the
royal
protocol
a
century
scarcely
had
elapsed
since
the
abdication
of
ramses
and
now
thebes
and
the
whole
of
egypt
owned
two
masters
one
the
embodiment
of
the
ancient
line
but
a
mere
nominal
king
the
other
the
representative
of
amon
and
the
actual
ruler
of
the
country
what
then
happened
when
the
last
ramses
who
bore
the
kingly
title
was
gathered
to
his
fathers
the
royal
lists
record
the
accession
after
his
death
of
a
new
dynasty
of
tanitic
origin
whose
founder
was
nsbindidi
or
smendes
but
on
the
other
hand
we
gather
from
the
theban
monuments
that
the
crown
was
seized
by
hrihor
who
reigned
over
the
southern
provinces
contemporaneously
with
smendes
hrihor
boldly
assumed
as
prenomen
his
title
of
prophet
of
amon
and
his
authority
was
acknowledged
by
ethiopia
over
which
he
was
viceroy
as
well
as
by
the
nomes
forming
the
temporal
domain
of
the
high
priests
the
latter
had
acquired
gradually
either
by
marriage
or
inheritance
fresh
territory
for
the
god
in
the
lands
of
the
princes
of
nekhabît
akhmîm
and
abydos
besides
the
domains
of
some
feudal
houses
who
from
force
of
circumstances
had
become
sacerdotal
families
the
extinction
of
the
direct
line
of
ramessides
now
secured
the
high
priests
the
possession
of
thebes
itself
and
of
all
the
lands
within
the
southern
provinces
which
were
the
appanage
of
the
crown
illustration
hrihor
drawn
by
from
champollion
they
thus
in
one
way
or
another
became
the
exclusive
masters
of
the
southern
half
of
the
nile
valley
from
elephantine
to
siut
beyond
siut
also
they
had
managed
to
acquire
suzerainty
over
the
town
of
khobît
and
the
territory
belonging
to
it
formed
an
isolated
border
province
in
the
midst
of
the
independent
baronies
the
extent
of
the
principality
of
thebes
under
the
high
priests
has
been
determined
by
means
of
the
sacerdotal
titles
of
the
theban
princesses
the
representative
of
the
dynasty
reigning
at
tanis
held
the
remainder
of
egypt
from
shit
to
the
mediterranean
the
half
belonging
to
the
memphite
phtah
and
the
râ
as
opposed
to
that
assigned
to
anion
the
origin
of
this
tanite
sovereign
is
uncertain
but
it
would
appear
that
he
was
of
more
exalted
rank
than
his
rival
in
the
south
the
official
chronicling
of
events
was
marked
by
the
years
of
his
reign
and
the
chief
acts
of
the
government
were
carried
out
in
his
name
even
in
the
thebaid
repeated
inundations
had
caused
the
ruin
of
part
of
the
temple
of
karnak
and
it
was
by
the
order
and
under
the
auspices
of
this
prince
that
all
the
resources
of
the
country
were
employed
to
accomplish
the
restoration
i
have
pointed
out
that
the
years
of
the
reign
mentioned
in
the
inscriptions
of
the
high
priests
and
the
kings
of
the
sacerdotal
line
must
be
attributed
to
their
suzerains
the
kings
of
tanis
hrihor
alone
seems
to
have
been
an
exception
since
to
him
are
attributed
the
dates
inscribed
in
the
name
of
the
king
siamon
daressy
however
will
not
admit
this
and
asserts
that
this
siamon
was
a
tanite
sovereign
who
must
not
be
identified
with
hrihor
and
must
be
placed
at
least
two
or
three
generations
later
than
the
last
of
the
ramessides
the
real
name
nsbindidi
and
the
first
monument
of
the
manethonian
smendes
were
discovered
in
the
quarries
of
dababîeh
opposite
gebelên
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
have
exercised
any
authority
over
so
rich
and
powerful
a
personage
as
hrihor
had
he
not
possessed
rights
to
the
crown
before
which
even
the
high
priests
of
amon
were
obliged
to
bow
and
hence
it
has
been
supposed
that
he
was
a
descendant
of
ramses
ii
the
descendants
of
this
sovereign
were
doubtless
divided
into
at
least
two
branches
one
of
which
had
just
become
extinct
leaving
no
nearer
heir
than
hrihor
while
another
of
which
there
were
many
ramifications
had
settled
in
the
delta
the
majority
of
these
descendants
had
become
mingled
with
the
general
population
and
had
sunk
to
the
condition
of
private
individuals
they
had
however
carefully
preserved
the
tradition
of
their
origin
and
added
proudly
to
their
name
the
qualification
of
royal
son
of
ramses
they
were
degenerate
scions
of
the
ramessides
and
had
neither
the
features
nor
the
energy
of
their
ancestor
one
of
them
whose
mummy
was
found
at
deîr
appears
to
have
been
tall
and
vigorous
but
the
head
lacks
the
haughty
refinement
which
characterizes
those
of
seti
and
ramses
and
the
features
are
heavy
and
coarse
having
a
vulgar
commonplace
expression
illustration

drawn
by

from
the
photograph

it
seems
probable
that
one
branch
of
the
family
endowed
with
greater
capability
than
the
rest
was
settled
at
tanis
where
sesostris
had
as
we
have
seen
resided
for
many
years
smendes
was
the
first
of
this
branch
to
ascend
the
throne
the
remembrance
of
his
remote
ancestor
ramses
il
which
was
still
treasured
up
in
the
city
he
had
completely
rebuilt
as
well
as
in
the
delta
into
which
he
had
infused
new
life
was
doubtless
of
no
small
service
in
securing
the
crown
for
his
descendant
when
the
line
of
the
theban
kings
having
come
to
an
end
the
tanites
put
in
their
claim
to
the
succession
we
are
unable
to
discover
if
war
broke
out
between
the
two
competitors
or
if
they
arrived
at
an
agreement
without
a
struggle
but
at
all
events
we
may
assume
that
having
divided
egypt
between
them
neither
of
them
felt
himself
strong
enough
to
overcome
his
rival
and
contented
himself
with
the
possession
of
half
the
empire
since
he
could
not
possess
it
in
its
entirety
we
may
fairly
believe
that
smendes
had
the
greater
right
to
the
throne
and
above
all
the
more
efficient
army
of
the
two
since
had
it
been
otherwise
hrihor
would
never
have
consented
to
yield
him
the
priority
the
unity
of
egypt
was
to
outward
appearances
preserved
through
the
nominal
possession
by
smendes
of
the
suzerainty
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
had
ceased
to
exist
and
the
fiction
of
the
two
kingdoms
had
become
a
reality
for
the
first
time
within
the
range
of
history
henceforward
there
were
two
egypts
governed
by
different
constitutions
and
from
widely
remote
centres
theban
egypt
was
before
all
things
a
community
recognizing
a
theocratic
government
in
which
the
kingly
office
was
merged
in
that
of
the
high
priest
separated
from
asia
by
the
length
of
the
delta
it
turned
its
attention
like
the
pharaohs
of
the
vith
and
xiith
dynasties
to
ethiopia
and
owing
to
its
distance
from
the
mediterranean
and
from
the
new
civilization
developed
on
its
shores
it
became
more
and
more
isolated
till
at
length
it
was
reduced
to
a
purely
african
state
northern
egypt
on
the
contrary
maintained
contact
with
european
and
asiatic
nations
it
took
an
interest
in
their
future
it
borrowed
from
them
to
a
certain
extent
whatever
struck
it
as
being
useful
or
beautiful
and
when
the
occasion
presented
itself
it
acted
in
concert
with
mediterranean
powers
there
was
an
almost
constant
struggle
between
these
two
divisions
of
the
empire
at
times
breaking
out
into
an
open
rupture
to
end
as
often
in
a
temporary
of
unity
at
one
time
ethiopia
would
succeed
in
annexing
egypt
and
again
egypt
would
seize
some
part
of
ethiopia
but
the
settlement
of
affairs
was
never
final
and
the
conflicting
elements
brought
with
difficulty
into
harmony
relapsed
into
their
usual
condition
at
the
end
of
a
few
years
a
kingdom
thus
divided
against
itself
could
never
succeed
in
maintaining
its
authority
over
those
provinces
which
even
in
the
heyday
of
its
power
had
proved
impatient
of
its
yoke
asia
was
associated
henceforward
in
the
minds
of
the
egyptians
with
painful
memories
of
thwarted
ambitions
rather
than
as
offering
a
field
for
present
conquest
they
were
pursued
by
the
memories
of
their
former
triumphs
and
the
very
monuments
of
their
cities
recalled
what
they
were
anxious
to
forget
wherever
they
looked
within
their
towns
they
encountered
the
representation
of
some
asiatic
scene
they
read
the
names
of
the
cities
of
syria
on
the
walls
of
their
temples
they
saw
depicted
on
them
its
princes
and
its
armies
whose
defeat
was
recorded
by
the
inscriptions
as
well
as
the
tribute
which
they
had
been
forced
to
pay
the
sense
of
their
own
weakness
prevented
the
egyptians
from
passing
from
useless
regrets
to
action
when
however
one
or
other
of
the
pharaohs
felt
sufficiently
secure
on
the
throne
to
carry
his
troops
far
afield
he
was
always
attracted
to

her
frontiers

the

the

the

which
it
had
so
long
prevailed
did
not
at
once
do
away
with
the
deep
impression
which
it
had
made
upon
their
constitution
and
customs
while
the
nobles
and
citizens
of
thebes
were
adopting
the
imported
worship
of
baal
and
astartê
and
were
introducing
into
the
spoken
and
written
language
words
borrowed
from
semitic
speech
the
syrians
on
the
other
hand
were
not
unreceptive
of
the
influence
of
their
conquerors
they
had
applied
themselves
zealously
to
the
study
of
egyptian
arts
industry
and
religion
and
had
borrowed
from
these
as
much
at
least
as
they
had
lent
to
the
dwellers
on
the
nile
the
ancient
babylonian
foundation
of
their
civilization
was
not
indeed
seriously
modified
but
it
was
covered
over
so
to
speak
with
an
african
veneer
which
varied
in
depth
according
to
the
locality
most
of
the
views
put
forth
in
this
part
of
the
chapter
are
based
on
posterior
and
not
contemporary
data
the
most
ancient
monuments
which
give
evidence
of
it
show
it
in
such
a
complete
state
that
we
may
fairly
ascribe
it
to
some
centuries
earlier
that
is
to
the
time
when
egypt
still
ruled
in
syria
the
period
of
the
xixth
and
even
the
xviiith
dynasty
phoenicia
especially
assumed
and
retained
this
foreign
exterior
its
merchants
accustomed
to
establish
themselves
for
lengthened
periods
in
the
principal
on
the
nile
had
become
imbued
therein
with
something
of
the
religious
ideas
and
customs
of
the
land
and
on
returning
to
their
own
country
had
imported
these
with
them
and
propagated
them
in
their
neighbourhood
they
were
not
content
with
other
household
utensils
furniture
and
jewellery
than
those
to
which
they
had
been
accustomed
on
the
nile
and
even
the
phonician
gods
seemed
to
be
subject
to
this
appropriating
mania
for
they
came
to
be
recognised
in
the
indigenous
deities
of
the
said
and
the
delta
there
was
at
the
outset
no
trait
in
the
character
of
baalat
by
which
she
could
be
assimilated
to
isis
or
hathor
she
was
fierce
warlike
and
licentious
and
wept
for
her
lover
while
the
egyptian
goddesses
were
accustomed
to
shed
tears
for
their
husbands
only
it
was
this
element
of
a
common
grief
however
which
served
to
associate
the
phonician
and
egyptian
goddesses
and
to
produce
at
length
a
strange
blending
of
their
persons
and
the
legends
concerning
them
the
lady
of
byblos
ended
in
becoming
an
isis
or
a
hathor
and
in
playing
the
part
assigned
to
the
latter
in
the
osirian
drama
the
assimilation
must
have
been
ancient
since
the
egyptians
of
the
theban
dynasties
already
accepted
baalat
as
the
hathor
of
byblos
illustration
the

growing

the

drawn

this
may
have
been
occasioned
by
her
city
having
maintained
closer
relationships
than
the
southern
towns
with
bûto
and
mendes
or
by
her
priests
having
come
to
recognise
a
fundamental
agreement
between
their
theology
and
that
of
egypt
in
any
case
it
was
at
byblos
that
the
most
marked
and
numerous
as
well
as
the
most
ancient
examples
of
borrowing
from
the
religions
of
the
nile
were
to
be
found
the
theologians
of
byblos
imagined
that
the
coffin
of
osiris
after
it
had
been
thrown
into
the
sea
by
typhon
had
been
thrown
up
on
the
land
somewhere
near
their
city
at
the
foot
of
a
tamarisk
and
that
this
tree
in
its
rapid
growth
had
gradually
enfolded
within
its
trunk
the
body
and
its
case
king
malkander
cut
it
down
in
order
to
use
it
as
a
support
for
the
roof
of
his
palace
a
marvellous
perfume
rising
from
it
filled
the
apartments
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
prodigy
was
bruited
abroad
isis
who
was
travelling
through
the
world
in
quest
of
her
husband
heard
of
it
and
at
once
realised
its
meaning
clad
in
rags
and
weeping
she
sat
down
by
the
well
whither
the
women
of
byblos
were
accustomed
to
come
every
morning
and
evening
to
draw
water
and
being
interrogated
by
them
refused
to
reply
but
when
the
maids
of
queen
approached
in
their
turn
they
were
received
by
the
goddess
in
the
most
amiable
manner
isis
deigning
even
to
plait
their
hair
and
to
communicate
to
them
the
odour
of
myrrh
with
which
she
herself
was
impregnated
astartê
is
the
name
taken
by
the
queen
in
the
phoenician
version
the
egyptian
counterpart
of
the
same
narrative
substituted
for
it
nemanous
or
saôsis
that
is
to
say
the
two
principal
forms
of
hathor
the
hermopolitan
nahmâûît
and
the
heliopolitan
lûsasît
it
would
appear
from
the
presence
of
these
names
that
there
must
have
been
in
egypt
two
versions
at
least
of
the
phoenician
adventures
of
isis
the
one
of
hermopolitan
and
the
other
of
heliopolitan
origin
their
mistress
came
to
see
the
stranger
who
had
thus
treated
her
servants
took
her
into
her
service
and
confided
to
her
the
care
of
her
lately
born
son
isis
became
attached
to
the
child
adopted
it
for
her
own
after
the
egyptian
manner
by
inserting
her
finger
in
its
mouth
and
having
passed
it
through
the
fire
during
the
night
in
order
to
consume
away
slowly
anything
of
a
perishable
nature
in
its
body
metamorphosed
herself
into
a
swallow
and
flew
around
the
miraculous
pillar
uttering
plaintive
cries
astartê
came
upon
her
once
while
she
was
bathing
the
child
in
the
flame
and
broke
by
her
shrieks
of
fright
the
charm
of
immortality
isis
was
only
able
to
reassure
her
by
revealing
her
name
and
the
object
of
her
presence
there
she
opened
the
mysterious
anointed
it
with
essences
and
wrapping
it
in
precious
cloths
transmitted
it
to
the
priests
of
byblos
who
deposited
it
respectfully
in
their
temple
she
put
the
coffin
which
it
contained
on
board
ship
and
brought
it
after
many
adventures
into
egypt
another
tradition
asserts
however
that
osiris
never
found
his
way
back
to
his
country
he
was
buried
at
byblos
this
tradition
maintained
and
it
was
in
his
honour
that
the
festivals
attributed
by
the
vulgar
to
the
young
adonis
were
really
celebrated
a
marvellous
fact
seemed
to
support
this
view
every
year
a
head
of
papyrus
thrown
into
the
sea
at
some
unknown
point
of
the
delta
was
carried
for
six
days
along
the
syrian
coast
buffeted
by
wind
and
waves
and
on
the
seventh
was
thrown
up
at
byblos
where
the
priests
received
it
and
exhibited
it
solemnly
to
the
people
the
details
of
these
different
stories
are
not
in
every
case
very
ancient
but
the
first
fact
in
them
carries
us
back
to
the
time
when
byblos
had
accepted
the
sovereignty
of
the
theban
dynasties
and
was
maintaining
daily
commercial
and
political
relations
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
nile
valley
in
the
later
roman
period
it
was
letters
announcing
the
resurrection
of
that
the
alexandrian
women
cast
into
the
sea
and
these
were
carried
by
the
current
as
far
as
byblos
see
on
this
subject
the
commentaries
of
cyril
of
alexandra
and
procopius
of
gaza
on
chap
xviii
of
isaiah
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
philo
gives
to
the
divinity
with
the
egyptian
name
taautos
the
part
in
the
ancient
history
of
phoenicia
of
having
edited
the
mystic
writings
put
in
order
by
sanchoniathon
at
a
very
early
epoch
the
city
proclaimed
horus
to
be
a
great
god
allied
himself
with
osiris
as
well
as
with
adonis
isis
and
baalat
became
blended
together
at
their
first
encounter
and
the
respective
peoples
made
an
exchange
of
their
deities
with
the
same
as
they
displayed
in
trafficking
with
the
products
of
their
soil
or
their
industry
this
is
confirmed
by
one
of
the
names
inscribed
on
the
tel
tablets
as
being
that
of
a
governor
of
byblos
under
amenôthes
iv
this
name
was
read
rabimur
anrabimur
or
ilrabimur
and
finally
ilurabihur
the
meaning
of
it
is
is
the
great
god

my
friend

osiris
the
ibis
thot
was
the
most
important
among
the
deities
who
had
emigrated
to
asia
he
was
too
closely
connected
with
the
osirian
cycle
to
be
forgotten
by
the
phoenicians
after
they
had
adopted
his
companions
we
are
ignorant
of
the
particular
divinity
with
whom
he
was
identified
or
would
be
the
more
readily
associated
from
some
similarity
in
the
pronunciation
of
his
name
we
know
only
that
he
still
preserved
in
his
new
country
all
the
power
of
his
voice
and
all
the
subtilty
of
his
mind
he
occupied
there
also
the
position
of
scribe
and
enchanter
as
he
had
done
at
thebes
memphis
thinis
and
before
the
chief
of
each
heliopolitan
ennead
he
became
the
usual
adviser
of
at
byblos
as
he
had
been
of
osiris
and
horus
he
composed
charms
for
him
and
formulae
which
increased
the
warlike
zeal
of
his
partisans
he
prescribed
the
form
and
insignia
of
the
god
and
of
his
attendant
deities
and
came
finally
to
be
considered
as
the
inventor
of
letters

part
of
counsellor

the
epoch
indeed
in
which
he
became
a
naturalised
phoenician
coincides
approximately
with
a
fundamental
revolution
in
the
art
of
writing
that
in
which
a
simple
and
rapid
stenography
was
substituted
for
the
complicated
and
tedious
systems
with
which
the
empires
of
the
ancient
world
had
been
content
from
their
origin

employed
up

the
most
intricate
of
these

western
asia
they
had
conducted
their
diplomatic

commercial
correspondence
in
the
cuneiform
character
impressed
upon

their
kings

had
recourse

loyalty

behold
them

interval

encumbrance

the
egyptian

in

their
cleverness
in

articulations
were
ultimately
resolved
into

have
not

between

points

first
the
almost
unanimous
agreement

writers

times
in
ascribing
the
first
alphabet
to
the
phoenicians
and
second
the
phonician
origin
of

greek
and
afterwards
of
the
latin
alphabet
which
we
employ
to
return
to
the
religion
of
the
phoenicians
the
foreign
deities
were
not
content
with
obtaining
a
high
place
in
the
estimation
of
priests
and
people
they
acquired
such
authority
over
the
native
gods
that

phoenicians

must
have

a
remembrance
of

of
this
imported
design
pietschmann
thinks
that
the
monument
is
not
older
than
the
greek
epoch
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
cornice
is
not
such
as
we
usually
meet
with
in
egypt
in
theban
times
nevertheless
the
very
marked
resemblance
to
the
theban
mastaba
shows
that
it
must
have
been
directly
connected
with
the
egyptian
type
which
prevailed
from

xxth
dynasties

the

surmounted
by
a
broad
flat

above
which
rises
the
pyramid
which
attains
a
height
of
nearly
thirty
feet
it
is
impossible
to
deny
that
it
is
constructed
on
a
foreign
model
it
is
not
a
slavish
imitation
however
but
rather
an
adaptation
upon
a
rational
plan
to
the
conditions
of
its
new
home
its
foundations

on
nothing

a
mixture

and
if
vaults
had
been
constructed
beneath
this
as
in
egypt
the
body
placed
there
would
soon
have
corrupted
away
owing
to
the
infiltration
of
moisture
the
dead
bodies
were
therefore
placed
within
the
structure
above

in
chambers
corresponding
to
the
egyptian

perpetually
flocked
thither

the

took
up
their
abode
on

island
at
an
early
date
about
the
time
when
some
of
their
bands
were
infesting
libya
and
offering
their
help
to
the
enemies
of
the
pharaoh
they
began
their
encroachments
on
the
northern
side
of
the
island
the
least
rich
it
is
true
but
the
nearest
to
cilicia
and
the
easiest
to
hold
against
the
attacks
of
their
rivals
the
disaster
of
piriu
had
no
doubt
dashed
their
hopes
of
finding
a
settlement
in
egypt
they
never
returned
thither
any
more
and
the
current
of
emigration
which
had
momentarily
inclined
towards
the
south
now
set
steadily
towards
the
east
where
the
large
island
of
cyprus
offered
an
unprotected
and
more
profitable
field
of
adventure
we
know
not
how
far
they
penetrated
into
its
forests
and
its
interior
the
natives
began
at
length
under
their
influence
to
despise
the
customs
and
mode
of
existence
with
which
they
had
been
previously
contented
they
acquired
a
taste
for
pottery
rudely
decorated
after
the
mycenean
manner
for
jewellery
and
for
the
bronze
swords
which
they
had
seen
in
the
hands
of
the
invaders
the
phoenicians
in
order
to
maintain
their
ground
against
the
intruders
had
to
strengthen
their
ancient
posts
or
found
others
such
as
carpasia
gerynia
and
lapathos
on
the
achæan
coast
itself
tamassos
near
the
and
a
new
town
which
is
perhaps
only
the
ancient
citium
under
a
new
name
they
thus
added
to
their
earlier
possessions
on
the
island
regions
on
its
northern
side
while
the
rest
either
fell
gradually
into
the
hands
of
hellenic
adventurers
or
continued
in
the
possession
of
the
native
populations
cyprus
served
henceforward
as
an
against
the
attacks
of
western
nations
and
the
phoenicians
must
have
been
thankful
for
the
good
fortune
which
had
made
them
see
the
wisdom
of
fortifying
it
but
what
became
of
their
possessions
lying
outside
cyprus
they
retained
several
of
them
on
the
southern
coasts
of
asia
minor
and
rhodes
remained
faithful
to
them
as
well
as
thasos
enabling
them
to
overlook
the
two
extremities
of
the
archipelago
but
owing
to
the
movements
of
the
people
of
the
sea
and
the
political
development
of
the
mycenean
states
they
had
to
give
up
the
stations
and
harbours
of
refuge
which
they
held
in
the
other
islands
or
on
the
continent
it
is
mentioned
in
the
inscription
of
baal
of
lebanon
and
in
the
assyrian
inscriptions
of
the
vii
century
this
would
appear
to
be
the
case
as
far
as
rhodes
is
concerned
from
the
traditions
which
ascribed
the
final
expulsion
of
the
phoenicians
to
a
doric
invasion
from
argos
the
somewhat
legendary
accounts
of
the
state
of
affairs
after
the
hellenic
conquest
are
in
the
fragments
of
ergias
and
polyzelos
they
still
continued
however
to
pay
visits
to
these
localities
sometimes
in
the
guise
of
merchants
and
at
others
as
raiders
according
to
their
ancient
custom
they
went
from
port
to
port
as
of
old
exposing
their
wares
in
the
pillaging
the
farms
and
villages
carrying
into
captivity
the
women
and
children
whom
they
could
entice
on
board
or
whom
they
might
find
defenceless
on
the
strand

attempted
all
this
with
more
risk
than
formerly
and
with
less
success

at

of
the

set
out
in
pursuit
of

following
the
example
set
by
their
foe
lay
in

for
them
behind
some
headland
and
retaliated
upon
them
for
their
cruelty
piracy
in
the
archipelago
was
practised
as
a
matter
of
course
and
there
was
no
islander
who
did
not
give
himself
up
to
it
when
the
opportunity
offered
to
return
to
his
honest
occupations
after
a
successful
venture
some
kings
seem
to
have
risen
up
here
and
there
who
found
this
state
of
affairs
intolerable
and
endeavoured
to
remedy
it
by
every
means
within
their
power
they
followed
on
the
heels
of
the
corsairs
and
adventurers
whatever
might
be
their
country
they
followed
them
up
to
their
harbours
of
refuge
and
became
an
effective
police
force
in
all
parts
of
the
sea
where
they
were
able
to
carry
their
flag
the
memory
of
such
exploits
was
preserved
in
the
tradition
of
the
cretan
empire
which
minos
had
constituted
and
which
extended
its
protection
over
a
portion
of
continental
greece
if
the
phoenicians
had
had
to
deal
only
with
the
piratical
expeditions
of
the
peoples
of
the
coast
or
with
the
jealous
watchfulness
of
the
rulers
of
the
sea
they
might
have
endured
the
evil
but
they
had
now
to
put
up
in
addition
with
rivalry
in
the
artistic
and
industrial
products
of
which
they
had
long
had
the
monopoly
the
spread
of
art
had
at
length
led
to
the
establishment
of
local
centres
of
production
everywhere
which
bade
fair
to
vie
with
those
of
phoenicia
on
the
continent
and
in
the
cyclades
there
were
produced
statuettes
intaglios
jewels
vases
weapons
and
textile
fabrics
which
rivalled
those
of
the
east
and
were
probably
much
cheaper
the
merchants
of
tyre
and
sidon
could
still
find
a
market
however
for
manufactures
requiring
great
technical
skill
or
displaying
superior
taste
such
as
gold
or
silver
bowls
engraved
or
decorated
with
figures
in
outline
but
they
had
to
face
a
serious
falling
off
in
their
sales
of
ordinary
goods
to
extend
their
commerce
they
had
to
seek
new
and
less
critical
markets
where
the
bales
of
their
wares
of
which
the
ægean
population
was
becoming
weary
would
lose
none
of
their
attractions
we
do
not
know
at
what
date
they
ventured
to
sail
into
the
mysterious
region
of
the
hesperides
nor
by
what
route
they
first
reached
it
it
is
possible
that
they
passed
from
crete
to
cythera
and
from
this
to
the
ionian
islands
and
to
the
point
of
calabria
on
the
other
side
of
the
straits
of
otranto
whence
they
were
able
to
make
their
way
gradually
to
sicily
ed
meyer
thinks
that
the
extension
of
phoenician
commerce
to
the
western
mediterranean
goes
back
to
the
xviiith
dynasty
or
at
the
latest
the
xvth
century
before
our
era
without
laying
undue
stress
on
this
view
i
am
inclined
to
ascribe
with
him
until
we
get
further
knowledge
the
colonisation
of
the
west
to
the
period
immediately
following
the
movements
of
the
people
of
the
sea
and
the
diminution
of
phoenician
trade
in
the
grecian
archipelago
exploring
voyages
had
been
made
before
this
but
the
founding
of
colonies
was
not
earlier
than
this
epoch
did
the
fame
of
their
discovery
we
may
ask
spread
so
rapidly
in
the
east
as
to
excite
there
the
cupidity
and
envy
of
their
rivals
however
this
may
have
been
the
people
of
the
sea
after
repeated
checks
in
africa
and
syria
and
feeling
more
than
ever
the
pressure
of
the
northern
tribes
encroaching
on
them
set
out
towards
the
west
following
the
route
pursued
by
the
phoenicians
the
traditions
current
among
them
and
collected
afterwards
by
the
greek
historians
give
an
account
mingled
with
many
fabulous
details
of
the
causes
which
led
to
their
migrations
and
of
the
vicissitudes
which
they
experienced
in
the
course
of
them
daedalus
having
taken
flight
from
crete
to
sicily

who
had
followed
in
his
steps
took
possession
of
the
greater
part
of
the

his
eteocretes
iolaos
was
the
leader
of
pelasgic
bands
whom
he
conducted
first
into
libya
and
finally
to
sardinia
it
came
also
to
pass
that
in
the
days
of
atys
son
of
manes
a
famine
broke
out
and
raged
throughout
lydia
the
king
unable
to
provide
food
for
his
people
had
them
numbered
and
decided
by
lot
which
of
the
two
halves
of
the
population
should
expatriate
themselves
under
the
leadership
of
his
son
tyrsenos
were
thus
fated
to
leave
their
country
assembled
at
smyrna
constructed
ships
there
and
having
embarked
on
board
of
them
what
was
necessary
set
sail
in
quest
of
a
new
home
after
a
long
and
devious
voyage
they
at
length
disembarked
in
the
country
of
the
umbrians
where
they
built
cities
and
became
a
prosperous
people
under
the
name
of
tyrseni
being
thus
called
after
their
leader
tyrsenos
herodotus
whence
all
the
information
of
other
classical
writers
is
directly
or
indirectly
taken
most
modern
historians
reject
this
tradition
i
see
no
reason
for
my
own
part
why
they
should
do
so
at
least
in
the
present
state
of
our
knowledge
the
etrurians
of
the
historical
period
were
the
result
of
a
fusion
of
several
different
elements
and
there
is
nothing
against
the
view
that
the
tursha
one
of
these
elements
should
have
come
from
asia
minor
as
herodotus
says
properly
understood
the
tradition
seems
well
founded
and
the
details
may
have
been
added
afterwards
either
by
the
lydians
themselves
or
by
the
greek
historians
who
collected
the
lydian
traditions
the
remaining
portions
of
the
nations
who
had
taken
part
in
the
attack
on
egypt
of
which
several
tribes
had
been
planted
by
ramses
iii
in
the
shephelah
from
gaza
to
carmel
proceeded
in
a
series
of
successive
detachments
from
asia
minor
and
the
ægean
sea
to
the
coasts
of
italy
and
of
the
large
islands
the
tursha
into
that
region
which
was
known
afterwards
as
etruria
the
shardana
into
sardinia
the
zakkala
into
sicily
and
along
with
the
latter
some
pulasati
whose
memory
is
still
preserved
on
the
northern
slope
of
etna
fate
thus
brought
the
phonician
emigrants
once
more
into
close
contact
with
their
traditional
enemies
and
the
hostility
which
they
experienced
in
their
new
settlements
from
the
latter
was
among
the
influences
which
determined
their
further
migration
from
italy
proper
and
from
the
region
occupied
by
the
ligurians
between
the
arno
and
the
ebro
they
had
already
probably
reached
sardinia
and
corsica
but
the
majority
of
their
ships
had
sailed
to
the
southward
and
having
touched
at
malta
gozo
and
the
small
islands
between
sicily
and
the
syrtes
had
followed
the
of
africa
until
at
length
they
reached
the
straits
of
gribraltar
and
the
southern
shores
of
spain
no
traces
remain
of
their
explorations
or
of
their
early
establishments
in
the
western
mediterranean
as
the
towns
which
they
are
thought
with
good
reason
in
most
instances
to
have
founded
there
belong
to
a
much
later
date
every
permanent
settlement
however
is
preceded
by
a
period
of
exploration
and
research
which
may
last
for
only
a
few
years
or
be
prolonged
to
as
many
centuries
i
am
within
the
mark
i
think
in
assuming
that
phonician
adventurers
or
possibly
even
the
regular
trading
ships
of
tyre
and
sidon
had
established
relations
with
the
chiefs
of
botica
as
early
as
the
xiith
century
before
our
era
that
is
at
the
time
when
the
power
of
thebes
was
fading
away
under
the
weak
rule
of
the
pontiffs
of
amon
and
the
tanite
pharaohs
the
phoenicians
were
too
much
absorbed
in
their
commercial
pursuits
to
aspire
to
the
inheritance
which
egypt
was
letting
slip
through
her
fingers
their
numbers
were
not
more
than
sufficient
to
supply
men
for
their
ships
and
they
were
often
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
their
allies
or
to
mercenary
tribes
the
leleges
or
carians
in
order
to
provide
crews
for
their
vessels
or
garrisons
for
their
trading
posts
it
was
impossible
therefore
for
them
to
think
of
raising
armies
fit
to
conquer
or
keep
in
check
the
rulers
on
the
orontes
or
in
naharaim
they
left
this
to
the
races
of
the
interior
the
amorites
and
hittites
and
to
their
restless
ambition
the
hittite
power
however
had
never
recovered
from
the
terrible
blow
inflicted
on
it

i
think
that
the

was
a
purely
local
affair
and
had
nothing
in
common
with
the
general
catastrophe
occasioned

possession
of
a
part
of
it
the
majority
of
these
invasions
had
however
no
permanent
result
they
never
issued
in
the
establishment
of
an
empire
like
that
of
the
khâti
capable
by
its
homogeneity
of
offering
a
serious
resistance
to
the
march
of
a
conqueror
from
the
south
to
sum
up
the
condition
of
affairs
if
a
redistribution
of
races
had
brought
about
a
change
in
northern
syria
their
want
of
cohesion
was
no
less
marked
than
in
the
time
of
the
egyptian
wars
the
first
enemy
to
make
an
attack
upon
the
frontier
of
one
or
other
of
these
tribes
was
sure
of
victory
and
if
he
persevered
in
his
efforts
could
make
himself
master
of
as
much
territory
as
he
might
choose
the
pharaohs
had
succeeded
in
welding
together
their
african
possessions
and
their
part
in
the
drama
of
conquest
had
been
played
long
ago
but
the
cities
of
the
tigris
and
the
lower
euphrates
nineveh
and
ready
to
enter
the
lists
as
soon
as
they
felt
themselves
strong
enough
to
revive
their
ancient
traditions
of
foreign
conquest
the
successors
of
agumkakrimê
were
not
more
fortunate
than
he
had
been
in
attempting
to
raise
babylon
once
more
to
the
foremost
rank
their
want
of
power
their
discord
the
insubordination
and
sedition
that
existed
among
their
cossæan
troops
and
the
almost
periodic
returns
of
the
theban
generals
to
the
banks
of
the
euphrates
sometimes
even
to
those
of
the
balikh
and
the
khabur
all
seemed
to
conspire
to
aggravate
the
helpless
state
into
which
babylon
had
sunk
since
the
close
of
the
dynasty
of
uruazagga
elam
was
pressing
upon
her
eastern
and
assyria
on
her
northern
frontier
and
their
kings
not
only
harassed
her
with
persistent
malignity
but
by
virtue
of
their
alliances
by
marriage
with
her
sovereigns
took
advantage
of
every
occasion
to
interfere
both
in
domestic
and
state
affairs
they
would
espouse
the
cause
of
some
pretender
during
a
revolt
they
would
assume
the
guardianship
of
such
of
their
relatives
as
were
left
widows
or
minors
and
when
the
occasion
presented
itself
they
took
possession
of
the
throne
of
bel
or
bestowed
it
on
one
of
their
creatures
assyria
particularly
seemed
to
regard
babylon
with
a
deadly
hatred
the
capitals
of
the
two
countries
were
not
more
than
some
one
hundred
and
miles
apart
the
intervening
district
being
a
flat
and
monotonous
alluvial
plain
unbroken
by
any
feature
which
could
serve
as
a
natural
frontier
the
line
of
demarcation
usually
followed
one
of
the
many
canals
in
the
narrow
strip
of
land
between
the
euphrates
and
the
tigris
it
then
crossed
the
latter
and
was
formed
by
one
of
the
rivers
draining
the
iranian
either
the
upper
zab
the
radanu
the
turnat
or
some
of
their
ramifications
in
the
spurs
of
the
mountain
ranges
each
of
the
two
states
strove
by
every
means
in
its
power
to
stretch
its
boundary
to
the
farthest
limits
and
to
keep
it
there
at
all
hazards
this
narrow
area
was
the
scene
of
continual
war
either
between
the
armies
of
the
two
states
or
those
of
partisans
suspended
from
time
to
time
by
an
elaborate
treaty
which
was
supposed
to
settle
all
difficulties
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
satisfied
no
one
and
left
both
parties
discontented
with
their
lot
and
jealous
of
each
other
the
concessions
made
were
never
of
sufficient
importance
to
enable
the
conqueror
to
crush
his
rival
and
regain
for
himself
the
ancient
domain
of
khammurabi
his
losses
on
the
other
hand
were
often
considerable
enough
to
paralyse
his
forces
and
prevent
him
from
extending
his
border
in
any
other
direction
when
the
egyptians
seized
on
naharaim
assyria
and
babylon
each
adopted
at
the
outset
a
different
attitude
towards
the
conquerors
assyria
which
never
laid
any
permanent
claims
to
the
seaboard
provinces
of
the
mediterranean
was
not
disposed
to
resent
their
occupation
by
egypt
and
desired
only
to
make
sure
of
their
support
or
their
neutrality
the
sovereign
then
ruling
assyria
but
of
whose
name
we
have
no
record
hastened
to
congratulate
thûtmosis
iii
on
his
victory
at
megiddo
and
sent
him
presents
of
precious
vases
slaves
chariots
and
horses
all
of
which
the
egyptian
conqueror
regarded
as
so
much
tribute
babylon
on
the
other
hand
did
not
take
action
so
promptly
as
assyria
it
was
only
towards
the
latter
years
of
thûtmosis
that
its
king
karaîndash
being
hard
pressed
by
the
assyrian
assurbelnishishu
at
length
decided
to
make
a
treaty
with
the
intruder
we
have
no
direct
testimony
in
support
of
this
hypothesis
but
several
important
considerations
give
it
probability
as
no
tribute
from
babylon
is
mentioned
in
the
of
thûtmosis
we
must
place
the
beginning
of
the
relations
between
egypt
and
chaldæa
at
a
later
date
on
the
other
hand
burnaburiash
in
a
letter
written
to
amenôthes
cites
karaîndash
as
the
first
of
fathers
who
had
established
friendly
relations
with
of
the
pharaoh
a
fact
which
obliges
us
to
place
the
interchange
of
presents
before
the
time
of
amenôthes
iii
as
the
reigns
of
amenôthes
ii
and
of
thûtmosis
iv
were
both
short
it
is
probable
that
these
relations
began
in
the
latter
years
of
thûtmosis
iii
the
remoteness
of
egypt
from
the
babylonian
frontier
no
doubt
relieved
karaîndash
from
any
apprehension
of
an
actual
invasion
by
the
pharaohs
but
there
was
the
possibility
of
their
subsidising
some
nearer
enemy
and
also
of
forbidding
babylonish
caravans
to
enter
egyptian
provinces
and
thus
crippling
chaldæan
commerce
friendly
relations
when
once
established
soon
necessitated
a
constant
interchange
of
embassies
and
letters
between
the
nile
and
the
euphrates
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
babylonian
king
could
never
reconcile
himself
to
the
idea
that
syria
had
passed
out
of
his
hands
while
pretending
to
warn
the
pharaoh
of
syrian
plots
against
him
the
babylonians
were
employing
at
the
same
time
secret
agents
to
go
from
city
to
city
and
stir
up
discontent
at
egyptian
rule
praising
the
while
the
great
cosssean
king
and
his
armies
and
inciting
to
revolt
by
promises
of
help
never
meant
to
be
fulfilled
assyria
whose
very
existence
would
have
been
endangered
by
the
of
a
babylonian
empire
never
missed
an
opportunity
of
denouncing
these
intrigues
at
they
warned
the
royal
messengers
and
governors
of
them
and
were
constantly
contrasting
the
frankness
and
honesty
of
their
own
dealings
with
the
duplicity
of
their
rival
this
was
done
by
kurigalzu
according
to
a
letter
addressed
by
his
son
burnaburiash
to
amenôthes
iv
this
state
of
affairs
lasted
for
more
than
half
a
century
during
which
time
both
courts
strove
to
ingratiate
themselves
in
the
favour
of
the
pharaoh
each
intriguing
for
the
exclusion
of
the
other
by
exchanging
presents
with
him
by
congratulations
on
his
accession
by
imploring
gifts
of
wrought
or
unwrought
gold
and
by
offering
him
the
most
beautiful
women
of
their
family
for
his
harem
the
son
of
karaîndash
whose
name
still
remains
to
be
discovered
bestowed
one
of
his
daughters
on
the
young
amenôthes
iii
kallimasin
the
sovereign
who
succeeded
him
also
sent
successively
two
princesses
to
the
same
pharaoh
but
the
underlying
bitterness
and
hatred
would
break
through
the
veneer
of
polite
formula
and
protestations
when
the
petitioner
received
as
the
result
of
his
advances
objects
of
inconsiderable
value
such
as
a
lord
might
distribute
to
his
vassals
or
when
he
was
refused
a
princess
of
solar
blood
or
even
an
egyptian
bride
of
some
feudal
house
at
such
times
however
an
ironical
or
haughty
epistle
from
thebes
would
recall
him
to
a
sense
of
his
own
inferiority
as
a
fact
the
lot
of
the
cossæan
sovereigns
does
not
appear
to
have
been
a
happy
one
in
spite
of
the
variety
and
pomposity
of
the
titles
which
they
continued
to
assume
they
enjoyed
but
short
lives
and
we
know
that
at
least
three
or
four
of
them
kallimasin
burnaburiash
and
kurigalzu
ascended
the
throne
in
succession
during
the
forty
years
that
amenôthes
iii
ruled
over
egypt
and
syria
the
copy
we
possess
of
the
royal
canon
of
babylon
is
mutilated
at
this
point
and
the
original
documents
are
not
sufficiently
complete
to
fill
the
gap
about
two
or
three
names
are
missing
after
that
of
agumkakrimê
and
the
reigns
must
have
been
very
short
if
indeed
as
i
think
krimî
and
karaîndash
were
both
contemporaries
of
the
earlier
pharaohs
bearing
the
name
of
thûtmosis
the
order
of
the
names
which
have
come
down
to
us
is
not
indisputably
established
the
following
order
appears
to
me
to
be
the
most
probable
at
present
karaîndash
kallimasin
burnaburiash
kurigalzu
burnaburiash
ii
karakhardash
kadashmankiiarbê
nazibugas
kurigalzu
ii
nazimaruttasii
kadashmanturgu
this
is
with
a
slight
exception
the
classification
adopted
by
winckler
and
that
of
hilprecht
differs
from
it
only
in
the
intercalation
of
kudurturgu
and
shagaraktiburiash
between
burnaburiash
ii
and
karakhardash
perhaps
the
rapidity
of
this
succession
may
have
arisen
from
some
internal
revolution
or
from
family
disturbances
the
chaldæans
of
the
old
stock
reluctantly
rendered
obedience
to
these
cosssean
kings
and
if
we
may
judge
from
the
name
one
at
least
of
these
ephemeral
sovereigns
kallimasin
appears
to
have
been
a
semite
who
owed
his
position
among
the
cossoan
princes
to
some
fortunate
chance
a
few
rare
inscriptions
stamped
on
bricks
one
or
two
letters
or
documents
of
private
interest
and
some
minor
objects
from
widely
distant
spots
have
enabled
us
to
ascertain
the
sites
upon
which
these
sovereigns
erected
buildings
karaîndash
restored
the
temple
of
nana
at
uruk
burnaburiash
and
kurigalzu
added
to
that
of
shamash
at
larsam
and
kurigalzu
took
in
hand
that
of
sin
at
uru
we
also
possess
a
record
of
some
of
their
acts
in
the
fragments
of
a
document
which
a
mnevite
scribe
of
the
time
of
assurbanipal
had
compiled
or
rather
jumbled
together
from
certain
babylonian
chronicles
dealing
with
the
wars
against
assyria
and
elam
with
public
treaties
marriages
and
family
quarrels
we
learn
from
this
for
example
that
burnaburiash
renewed
with
buzurassur
the
conventions
drawn
up
between
karaîndash
and
assurbelnishishu
these
friendly
relations
were
maintained
apparently
under
kurigalzu
and
the
son
of
buzurassur
if
kurigalzu
built
or
restored
the
fortress
long
called
after
him
at
one
of
the
fords
of
the
narmalka
it
was
probably
as
a
precautionary
measure
rather
than
because
of
any
immediate
danger
the
relations
between
the
two
powers
became
somewhat
strained
when
burnaburiash
ii
and
assuruballît
had
respectively
succeeded
to
kurigalzu
and
this
did
not
however
lead
to
hostilities
and
the
subsequent
betrothal
of
karakhardash
son
of
burnaburiash
to
mubauîtatseruâ
daughter
of
assuruballît
tended
to
restore
matters
to
their
former
condition
this
is
what
is
generally
called
the
history
the
principal
remains
of
which
were
discovered
and
published
by
rawlinson
it
is
a
very
unskilful
complication
in
which
winckler
has
discovered
several
blunders
is
mentioned
in
a
tel
tablet
as
being
the
father
of
assuruballît
this
is
the
present
akerkuf
as
is
proved
by
the
discovery
of
bricks
bearing
the
name
of
kurigalzu
but
perhaps
what
i
have
attributed
to
kurigalzu
must
be
referred
to
the
second
king
of
that
name
we
infer
this
from
the
way
in
which
burnaburiash
speaks
of
the
assyrians
in
the
correspondence
with
amenôthes
iv
the
good
will
between
the
two
countries
became
still
more
pronounced
when
kadashmankharbê
succeeded
his
father
karakhardash
the
cossæan
soldiery
had
taken
umbrage
at
his
successor
and
had
revolted
assassinated
kadashmankharbê
and
proclaimed
king
in
his
stead
a
man
of
obscure
origin
named
nazibùgash
assuruballît
without
a
hesitation
took
the
side
of
his
new
relatives
he
crossed
the
frontier
killed
nazibugash
and
restored
the
throne
to
his
child
kurigalzu
the
younger
the
young
king
who
was
still
a
minor
at
his
accession
appears
to
have
met
with
no
serious
difficulties
at
any
rate
none
were
raised
by
his
assyrian
cousins
belnirârî
and
his
successor
budîlu
the
erroneously
places
the
events
of
the
reign
of
in
that
of
belnirârî
the
order
of
succession
of
buzurassur
assuruballît
belnirârî
and
budîlu
has
been
established
by
the
bricks
of
towards
the
close
of
his
reign
however
revolts
broke
out
and
it
was
only
by
sustained
efforts
that
he
was
able
to
restore
order
in
babylon
sippara
and
the
country
of
the
sea
while
the
king
was
in
the
midst
of
these
difficulties
the
elamites
took
advantage
of
his
troubles
to
steal
from
him
a
portion
of
his
territory
and
their
king
khurbatila
challenged
him
to
meet
his
army
near
kurigalzu
accepted
the
challenge
gained
a
decisive
victory
took
his
adversary
prisoner
and
released
him
only
on
receiving
as
ransom
a
province
beyond
the
tigris
he
even
entered
susa
and
from
among
other
trophies
of
past
wars
resumed
possession
of
an
agate
tablet
belonging
to
dungi
which
the
veteran
kudurnakhunta
had
stolen
from
the
temple
of
nipur
nearly
a
thousand
years
previously
this
victory
was
followed
by
the
congratulations
of
most
of
his
neighbours
with
the
exception
of
who
had
succeeded
budîlu
in
assyria
and
probably
felt
some
jealousy
or
uneasiness
at
the
news
he
attacked
the
cossæans
and
overthrew
them
at
sugagi
on
the
banks
of
the
salsallât
their
losses
were
considerable
and
kurigalzu
could
only
obtain
peace
by
the
cession
to
assyria
of
a
strip
of
territory
the
entire
length
of
the
frontier
from
the
confines
of
the
shubari
country
near
the
sources
of
the
khabur
to
the
suburbs
of
babylon
itself
nearly
the
whole
of
mesopotamia
thus
changed
hands
at
one
stroke
but
babylon
had
still
more
serious
losses
to
suffer
nazimaruttash
who
attempted
to
wipe
out
the
disaster
sustained
by
his
father
kurigalzu
experienced
two
crushing
defeats
one
at
and
the
other
near
akarsallu
and
the
treaty
which
he
subsequently
signed
was
even
more
humiliating
for
his
country
than
the
preceding
one
all
that
part
of
the
babylonian
domain
which
lay
nearest
to
nineveh
was
ceded
to
the
assyrians
from
pilaski
on
the
right
bank
of
the
tigris
to
the
province
of
lulumê
in
the
zagros
mountains
it
would
appear
that
the
cossæan
tribes
who
had
remained
in
their
native
country
took
advantage
of
these
troublous
times
to
sever
all
connection
with
their
established
in
the
cities
of
the
plain
for
we
find
them
henceforward
carrying
on
a
petty
warfare
for
their
own
profit
and
leading
an
entirely
independent
life
the
descendants
of
gandish
deprived
of
territories
in
the
north
repulsed
in
the
east
and
threatened
in
the
south
by
the
nations
of
the
persian
gulf
never
recovered
their
former
ascendency
and
their
authority
slowly
declined
during
the
century
which
followed
these
events
their
downfall
brought
about
the
decadence
of
the
cities
over
which
they
had
held
sway
and
the
supremacy
which
babylon
had
exercised
for
a
thousand
years
over
the
countries
of
the
euphrates
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
assyrian
kings
assyria
itself
was
but
a
poor
and
insignificant
country
when
compared
with
her
rival
it
occupied
on
each
side
of
the
middle
course
of
the
tigris
the
territory
lying
between
the
and
parallels
of
latitude
these
are
approximately
the
limits
of
the
first
assyrian
empire
as
given
by
the
monuments
from
the
persian
epoch
onwards
the
name
was
applied
to
the
whole
course
of
the
tigris
as
far
as
the
mountain
district
the
ancient
orthography
of
the
name
is

bounded
on
the
east
by

hills

running
parallel
to

believe

that

have
been
applied

on

think
with
more
reason
that
it
was
the
god
who
gave
his
name
to
the

and
the

make
a
point
of
the
very
ancient
play
of
words
which
in
assyria
itself
attributed
the
meaning
to
the

ashur
jensen
was
the
first
to
state
that
ashur
was
the
god
anshâr
of
the
account
of
the
creation
the
god
himself
was
a
deity
of
light
usually
represented
under
the
form
of
an
armed
man
wearing
the
tiara
and
having
the
lower
half
of
his
body
concealed
by
a
feathered
disk
he
was
supposed
to
hover
continually
over
the
world
hurling
fiery
darts
at
the
enemies
of
his
people
and
protecting
his
kingly
worshippers
under
the
shadow
of
his
wings
their
wars
were
his
wars
and
he
was
with
them
in
the
thick
of
the
attack
placing
himself
in
the
front
rank
with
the
soldiery
so
that
when
he
gained
the
victory
the
bulk
of
the
spoil
precious
metals
gleanings
of
the
slaves
and
productive
lands
fell
to
his
share
the
gods
of
the
vanquished
enemy
moreover
were
like
their
princes
forced
to
render
him
homage
in
the
person
of
the
king
he
took
their
statues
prisoners
and
shut
them
up
in
his
sanctuary
sometimes
he
would
engrave
his
name
upon
their
figures
and
send
them
back
to
their
respective
temples
where
the
sight
of
them
would
remind
their
worshippers
of
his
own
omnipotence
the
goddess
associated
with
him
as
his
wife
had
given
her
name
nina
to
nineveh
and
was
as
the
companion
of
the
chaldæan
bel
styled
the
divine
lady
belit

was
in

a
chaste
and
warlike
ishtar

led

armies
into

with
a
boldness
characteristic
of
her
father
in

of

pictures
for
instance
representing
the
assault
of
a
town
we
see
a
small
figure
of
the
god
hurling
darts
against
the
enemy

inscriptions
also
state
that
the
peoples
alarmed
and
quit
their
cities

arms
of
assur
the
powerful
as
for
instance
the
statues
of
the
gods
taken
from
the
arabs
in
the
time
of
esarhaddon
had
carried
away
statues
of

placed
them
in

the
name

nina
serves
to
write
the
name
of

name
itself
has
been
interpreted
by
schrader
as
habitation
in
the
semitic
languages
and
by
fr
delitzsch
of
the
god
an
interpretation
which
delitzsch
himself
repudiated
later
on
it
is
probable
that
the
town
which
like
assur
was
a
chaldæan
colony
derived
its
name
from
the
goddess
to
whom
it
was
dedicated

rather

time

was
called
their
lord
their
king
and
as
a
proof
of
his
supreme
sovereignty
over
them
his
name
was
inscribed
at
the
head
of

lists

and
the
coolness
of

rendered
the

became
the
custom
for
the
kings
and

to
pass
the
most
trying
months
of
the
year
at
nineveh
taking
up
their
abode
close
to
the
temple
of
nina
the
assyrian
ishtar
but
they
did
not
venture
to
make
it
their
habitual
residence

consequently

remained

official
capital
and

sanctuary
of
the

its
rulers
concentrated

treasures

archives

offices

they
set
out
on
their
expeditions
against
the
cossæans
of
babylon

the
mountaineers
of

districts
beyond

in
this

that
they
dedicated
to
the

the
tenth
of

successful
campaign
the
majority
of
scholars
now
admit
that

mentioned
by

the
vicegerents
of

was
a
quarter
of

neighbouring
borough

had
nothing
in
common
with
nineveh
in

assumption
to
the
contrary
the
struggle
with
chaldæa
indeed
occupied
the
greater
part
of
their
energies
though
it
did
not
absorb
all
their
resources
and
often
left
them
times
of
respite
of
which
they
availed
themselves
to
extend
their
domain
to
the
north

east

can
not
yet
tell

of

sovereigns
added

nearest
provinces

to
recognise
that

be

the

his
opinion
is
now
admitted
by
most
of
the
assyriologists

have
studied

question

smote
the
agricultural
districts
with
fire
and
sword
and
then
turned
upon
the
various
peoples
who
had
espoused
their
cause
the
kirkhu
the
euri
the
kharrîn
and
the
muzri
who
inhabited
the
territory
between
the
basins
of
the
two
great
rivers
once
indeed
he
even
crossed
the
euphrates
and
ventured
within
the
country
of
khanigalbat
a
feat
which
his
ancestors
had
never
even
attempted

the
position
of
the
ruri
is
not
known
but
it
is
certain
that
on
one
side
they
joined
the
aramaeans

that
they
were
in
the
neighbourhood
of
tushkhân
kharrân

the

the
name
of
muzri
frequently
occurs
and
in
various
positions
among
the
countries
mentioned
by
the
assyrian
conquerors
the
frequency
of
its
occurrence
is
easily
explained
if
we
are
to
regard
it
as
a
purely
assyrian
term
used
to
designate
the
military
confines
or
marches
of
the
kingdom
at
different
epochs
of
its
history
the
muzri
here
in

is
the
borderland
situated
in
the
vicinity
of
cilicia
probably
the
sophene
and
the
gumathene
of
classical
geographers
winckler
appears
to
me
to
exaggerate
their
importance
when
he
says
they
were
spread
over
the
whole
of
northern
syria
as
early
as
the
time
of
shalmaneser
i
khanigalbat
is
the
name
of
the
province
in
which
milid
was
placed
he
was
recalled
by
a
revolt
which
had
broken
out
in
the
scattered
cities
of
the
district
of
he
crushed
the
rising
in
spite
of
the
help
which
king
of
babylon
had
given
to
the
rebels
and
was
soon
successful
in
subduing
the
princes
of
lulumê
these
were
not
the
raids
of
a
duration
undertaken
without
any
regard
to
the
future
merely
from
love
of
rapine
or
adventure
shalmaneser
desired
to
bring
the
regions
which
he
annexed
permanently
under
the
authority
of
assyria
and
to
this
end
he
established
military
colonies
in
suitable
places
most
of
which
were
kept
up
long
after
his
death
more
than
five
centuries
after
the
time
of
shalmaneser
makes
mention
in
his
of
one
of
these
colonies
established
in
the
country
of
diarbekîr
at
khabzilukha
or
khabzidipkha
near
to
the
town
of
damdamua
he
seems
to
have
directed
the
internal
affairs
of
his
kingdom
with
the
same
firmness
and
energy
which
he
displayed
in
his
military
expeditions
it
was
no
light
matter
for
the
sovereign
to
decide
on
a
change
in
the
seat
of
government
he
ran
the
risk
of
offending
not
merely
his
subjects
but
the
god
who
presided
over
the
destinies
of
the
state
and
neither
his
throne
nor
his
life
would
have
been
safe
had
he
failed
in
his
attempt
shalmaneser
however
did
not
hesitate
to
make
the
change
once
he
was
fully
convinced
of
the
drawbacks
presented
by
assur
as
a
capital
true
he
beautified
the
city
restored
its
temples
and
permitted
it
to
retain
all
its
privileges
and
titles
but
having
done
so
he
migrated
with
his
court
to
the
town
of
kalakh
where
his
descendants
continued
to
reside
for
several
centuries
his
son
made
himself
master
of
babylon
and
was
the
first
of
his
race
who
was
able
to
claim
the
title
of
king
of
sumir

akkad
the
cossæans

still
suffering
from

broke
out
between
the
two
monarchs
but
dragged
on
without
any
marked
advantage
on
one
side
or
the
other
till
at
length
the
conflict
was
temporarily
suspended
by
a
treaty
similar
to
others
which
had
been
signed
in
the
course
of
the
previous
two
or
three
centuries
the
passage
from
the
republished
by
winckler
contains
the
termination
of
the
mutilated
name
of
a
babylonian
king
which
originally
left
undecided
by
winckler
has
been
restored
by
hilprecht
in
the
light
of
monuments
discovered
at
nipur
an
emendation
which
has
since
then
been
accepted
by
winckler
winckler
on
his
part
has
restored
the
passage
on
the
assumption
that
the
name
of
the
king
of
assyria
engaged
against
bibeiashu
was
then
combining
this
fragment
with
that
in
the
which
deals
with
the
taking
of
babylon
he
argues
that
bibeiashu
was
the
king
dethroned
by
an
examination
of
the
dates
in
so
far
as
they
are
at
present
known
to
us
from
the
various
documents
seems
to
me
to
render
this
arrangement
inadmissible
the
practically
tells
us
that
reigned
over
babylon
for
when
the
chaldæans
revolted
and
named
rammânshumusur
king
now
the
babylonian
canon
gives
us
the
following
reigns
for
this
epoch
bibeiashu
belnadînshumu
year
kadashmankharbe
year
rammânnadînshumu
rammânshumusur
years
or
between
the
end
of
the
reign
of
bibeiashu
and
the
beginning
of
that
of
rammânshumusur
instead
of
the
given
us
by
the
for
the
length
of
the
reign
of
ninip
at
babylon
if
we
reckon
as
the
only
documents
known
require
us
to
do
seven
years
from
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
rammânshumusur
to
the
date
of
the
taking
of
babylon
we
are
forced
to
admit
that
this
took
place
in
the
reign
of
kadashmankharbe
il
and
consequently
that
the
passage
in
the
in
which
mention
is
made
of
bibeiashu
must
be
interpreted
as
i
have
done
in
the
text
by
the
hypothesis
of
a
war
prior
to
that
in
which
babylon
fell
which
was
followed
by
a
treaty
between
this
prince
and
the
king
of
assyria
the
peace
thus
concluded
might
have
lasted
longer
but
for
an
unforeseen
catastrophe
which
placed
babylon
almost
at
the
mercy
of
her
rival
the
blamites
had
never
abandoned
their
efforts
to
press
in
every
conceivable
way
their
claim
to
the
the
supremacy
which
prior
to
kbammurabi
had
been
exercised
by
their
ancestors
over
the
whole
of
mesopotamia
they
swooped
down
on
karduniash
with
an
impetuosity
like
that
of
the
assyrians
and
probably
with
the
same
alternations
of
success
and
defeat
their
king
kidinkhutrutash
unexpectedly
attacked
belnadînshumu
son
of
bibeiashu
appeared
suddenly
under
the
walls
of
nipur
and
forced
the
defences
of
durîlu
and
belnadînshumu
disappeared
in
the
struggle
after
a
reign
of
eighteen
months
left
successor
kadashmankharbe
no
time
to
recover
from
this
disaster
he
attacked
him
in
turn
carried
babylon
by
main
force
and
put
a
number
of
the
inhabitants
to
the
sword
he
looted
the
palace
and
the
temples
dragged
the
statue
of
merodach
from
its
sanctuary
and
carried
it
off
into
assyria
together
with
the
badges
of
supreme
power
then
after
appointing
governors
of
his
own
in
the
various
towns
he
returned
to
kalakh
laden
with
booty
he
led
captive
with
him
several
members
of
the
royal
family
among
others
bammânshumusur
the
lawful
successor
of
bibeiashu
this
first
conquest
of
chaldæa
did
not
however
produce
any
lasting
results
the
fall
of
babylon
did
not
necessarily
involve
the
subjection
of
the
whole
country
and
the
cities
of
the
south
showed
a
bold
front
to
the
foreign
intruder
and
remained
faithful
to
kadashmankharbe
on
the
death
of
the
latter
some
months
after
his
defeat
they
hailed
as
king
a
certain
bammânshumnadîn
who
by
some
means
or
other
had
made
his
escape
from
captivity
bammânshumnadîn
proved
himself
a
better
man
than
his
predecessors
when
kidinkhutrutash
never
dreaming
apparently
that
he
would
meet
with
any
serious
resistance
came
to
claim
his
share
of
the
spoil
he
defeated
him
near
ishin
drove
him
out
of
the
districts
recently
occupied
by
the
elamites
and
so
effectually
retrieved
his
fortunes
in
this
direction
that
he
was
able
to
concentrate
his
whole
attention
on
what
was
going
on
in
the
north
the
effects
of
his
victory
soon
became
apparent
the
nobles
of
akkad
and
karduniash
declined
to
pay
homage
to
their
assyrian
governors
and
ousting
them
from
the
offices
to
which
they
had
been
appointed
restored
babylon
to
the
independence
which
it
had
lost
seven
years
previously
paid
dearly
for
his
incapacity
to
retain
his
conquests
his
son
assurnazirpal
conspired
with
the
principal
officers
deposed
him
from
the
throne
and
confined
him
in
the
fortified
palace
of
which
he
had
built
not
far
from
kalakh
where
he
soon
after
contrived
his
assassination
about
this
time
rammânshumnadîn
disappears
and
we
can
only
suppose
that
the
disasters
of
these
last
years
had
practically
annihilated
the
cossæan
dynasty
for
who
was
a
prisoner
in
assyria
was
chosen
as
his
successor
the
monuments
tell
us
nothing
definite
of
the
troubles
which
next
befell
the
two
kingdoms
we
seem
to
gather
however
that
assyria
became
the
scene
of
civil
wars
and
that
the
sons
of
fought
for
the
crown
among
themselves
tukultiassurbel
who
gained
the
upper
hand
at
the
end
of
six
years
set
at
liberty
probably
with
the
view
of
purchasing
the
support
of
the
chaldæans
but
he
did
not
succeed
in
restoring
his
country
to
the
position
it
had
held
under
shalmaneser
and
i
the
history
of
assyria
presents
a
greater
number
of
violent
contrasts
and
extreme
vicissitudes
than
that
of
any
other
eastern
people
in
the
earliest
times
no
sooner
had
the
assyrians
arrived
thanks
to
the
ceaseless
efforts
of
five
or
six
generations
at
the
very
summit
of
their
ambition
than
some
incompetent
or
perhaps
merely
unfortunate
king
appeared
on
the
scene
and
lost
in
a
few
years
all
the
ground
which
had
been
gained
at
the
cost
of
such
tremendous
exertions
then
the
subject
races
would
rebel
the
neighbouring
peoples
would
pluck
up
courage
and
reconquer
the
provinces
which
they
had
surrendered
till
the
dismembered
empire
gradually
shrank
back
to
its
original
dimensions
as
the
fortunes
of
babylon
rose
those
of
nineveh
suffered
a
corresponding
depression
babylon
soon
became
so
powerful
that
eammânshumusur
was
able
to
adopt
a
patronising
tone
in
his
relations
with
and
nabodaînâni
the
descendants
of
tukultiassurbel
who
at
one
time
shared
the
throne
together
all
that
we
know
of
these
two
kings
is
contained
in
the
copy
executed
in
the
time
of
assurbanipal
of
a
letter
addressed
to
them
by
eammânshumusur
they
have
been
placed
at
one
time
or
another
either
at
the
beginning
of
assyrian
history
before
assurbelnishishu
or
after
about
the
xith
or
xth
or
even
the
viiith
century
before
our
era
it
has
since
been
discovered
that
the
rammânshumusur
who
wrote
this
letter
was
the
successor
of
in
chaldæa
this
period
of
subjection
and
humiliation
did
not
last
long
belkudurusur
who
appears
on
the
throne
not
long
after
assurnirâri
and
his
partner
resumed
military
operations
against
the
cossæans
but
cautiously
at
first
and
though
he
fell
in
the
decisive
engagement
yet
perished
with
him
and
the
two
states
were
thus
simultaneously
left
rulerless
milishikhu
succeeded
bammânshumusur
and
ninipahalesharra
filled
the
place
of
belkudurusur
the
disastrous
invasion
of
assyria
by
the
chaldæans
and
their
subsequent
retreat
at
length
led
to
an
armistice
which
while
it
afforded
evidence
of
the
indisputable
superiority
of
milishikhu
proved
no
less
plainly
the
independence
of
his
rival
replaced
milishikhu

merodachabaliddina
assurdân

captured
the
towns

irrîa

akarsallu
and
succeeded
in
retaining
them
the
advantage
thus
gained
was
but
a
slight
one
for
these
provinces

between
the
two
zabs
had
long
been
subject
to
assyria
and
had
been
wrested
from
her
since
the
days

it
broke
the
run
of
ill
luck
which
seemed
to
have
pursued
her
so
relentlessly
and
opened
the
way
for
more
important
victories
this
was
the
last
cossæan
war
at
any
rate
the
last
of
which
we
find
any
mention
in
history
ii
reigned
three
years
after
but
when
he
died
there
was
no
man
of
his
family
whom
the
priests
could
invite
to
lay
hold
of
the
hand
of
merodach
and
his
dynasty
ended
with
him
it

and
had
lasted
five
hundred
and
years
and
six
months
the
following

a
list
of
some
of
the
kings
of
this
dynasty
according
to

it
had
enjoyed
its
moments
of
triumph
and
at
one
time
had
almost
seemed
destined
to
conquer
the
whole
of
asia
but
it
appears
to
have
invariably
failed
just
as
it
was
on
the
point
of
reaching
the
goal
and
it
became
completely
exhausted
by
its
victories
at
the
end
of
every
two
or
three
generations
it
had
triumphed
over
elam
and
yet
elam
remained
a
constant
peril
on
its
right
it
had
triumphed
over
assyria
yet
assyria
after
driving
it
back
to
the
regions
of
the
upper
tigris
threatened
to
bar
the
road
to
the
mediterranean
by
means
of
its
masian
colonies
were
they

to
succeed
in
this
attempt
what
hope
would
there
be
left
to
those
who
ruled
in
babylon
of
ever
after
the
traditional
empire
of
the
ancient
sargon

khammurabi
the
new

sprang
from
a
town
in

geographical
position

himself
to
have
been
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
of
all
those
who
flourished
during
this
troubled
era
at
no
time
perhaps
had
chaldæa
been
in
a
more
abject
state
or
assailed
by
more
active
foes
the
elamite
had
just
succeeded
in
wresting
from
her
namar
the
region
from
whence
the
bulk
of
her
were
obtained
and
this
success
had
laid
the
provinces
on
the
left
bank
of
the
tigris
open
to
their
attacks
they
had
even
crossed

no

his
on
their
coming
to

copy
we
possess
of
the
royal
canon
nebuchadrezzar
place
in
the
series
has
therefore
been
the
subject
of
much
controversy
several
assyriologists
were
from
the
first
inclined
to
place
him
in
the
first
or
second
rank
some
being
in
favour
of
the
first
others
preferring
the
second
dolitzsch
put
him
into
the
fifth
place
and
winckler
without
pronouncing
definitely
on
the
position
to
be
assigned
him
thought
he
must
come
in
about
down
the
dynasty
hilprecht
on
taking
up
the
questions
adduced
reasons
for
supposing
him
to
have
been
the
founder
of
the
dynasty
and
his
conclusions
have
been
adopted
by
oppert
they
have
been
disputed
by
tiele
who
wishes
to
put
the
king
back
to
fourth
or
fifth
in
order
and
by
winckler
who
places
him
fourth
or
fifth
it
is
difficult
however
to
accept
hypothesis
plausible
though
it
is
so
long
as
assyriologists
who
have
seen
the
original
tablet
agree
in
declaring
that
the
name
of
the
first
king
began
with
the
sign
of
and
not
with
that

as
it
ought
to
do

roaring
like

as

of

his
prayer

there

cries
of
grief

till
what

thou

make

joyful

let
thy

be
turned
toward

thou
lovest
merodach
gave
ear
to
the
plaint
of
his
servant
he
answered
him
graciously
and
promised
his
aid
namar
united
as
it
had
been
with
chaldæa
for
centuries
did
not
readily
become
accustomed
to
its
new
masters
the
greater
part
of
the
land
belonged
to
a
semitic
and
cossæan
feudality
the
heads
of
which
while
admitting
their
right
to
exact
military
service
from
them
refused
to
acknowledge
any
further
duty
towards
him
the
kings
of
susa
declined
to
recognise
their
privileges
they
subjected
them
to
a
levied
the
usual
imposts
on
their
estates
and
forced
them
to
maintain
at
their
own
expense
the
troops
quartered
on
them
for
the
purpose
of
guaranteeing
their
obedience
shamuà
and
shamaî
in
like
manner
towards
karduniash
before
the
king
of
elam
it
would
seem
that
rittimerodach
had
entered
into
secret
negotiations
with
nebuchadrezzar
though
this
is
nowhere
explicitly
stated
in
the
text
several
of
the
nobles
abandoned
everything
rather
than
submit
to
such
tyranny
and
took
refuge
with
nebuchadrezzar
others
entered
into
secret
negotiations
with
him
and
promised
to
support
him
if
he
came
to
their
help
with
an
armed
force
he
took
them
at
their
word
and
invaded
namar
without
warning
in
the
month
of
tamuz
while
the
summer
was
at
its
height
at
a
season
in
which
the
elamites
never
even
dreamt
he
would
take
the
field
the
heat
was
intense
water
was
not
to
be
got
and
the
army
suffered
terribly
from
thirst
during
its
forced
march
of
over
a
hundred
miles
across
a
country
one
of
the
malcontents
eittimerodach
lord
of
bitkarziabku
joined
nebuchadrezzar
with
all
the
men
he
could
assemble
and
together
they
penetrated
as
far
as
ulaî
the
king
of
elam
taken
by
surprise
made
no
attempt
to
check
their
progress
but
collected
his
vassals
and
awaited
their
attack
on
the
banks
of
the
river
in
front
of
susa
once
fire
of
the
combat
had
been
lighted
between
the
opposing
forces
the
face
of
the
sun
grew
dark
the
tempest
broke
forth
the
whirlwind
raged
and
in
this
whirlwind
of
the
struggle
none
of
the
characters
could
distinguish
the
face
of
his
nebuchadrezzar
cut
off
from
his
own
men
was
about
to
surrender
or
be
killed
when
eittimerodach
flew
to
his
rescue
and
brought
him
off
safely
in
the
end
the
chaldæans
gained
the
upper
hand
to
rittimerodach
i
the
description
of
the
battle
as
given
in
this
document
is
generally
taken
to
be
merely
symbolical
and
i
have
followed
the
current
usage
but
if
we
bear
in
mind
that
the
text
lays
emphasis
on
the
drought
and
severity
of
the
season
we
are
tempted
to
agree
with
pinches
and
budge
that
its
statements
should
be
taken
literally
the
affair
may
have
been
begun
in
a
cloud
of
dust
and
have
ended
in
a
downpour
of
rain
so
heavy
as
to
partly
blind
the
combatants
the
king
was
probably
drawn
away
from
his
men
in
the
confusion
it
was
probably
then
that
he
was
in
danger
of
being
made
prisoner
and
that
rittimerodach
suddenly
coming
up
delivered
him
from
the
foes
who
surrounded
him
the
elamites
renounced
their
claims
to
the
possession
of
namar
and
restored
the
statues
of
the
gods
nebuchadrezzar
once
laid
hold
of
the
hands
of
bel
and
thus
legalised
his
accession
to
the
throne
other
expeditions
against
the
peoples
of
lulurne
and
against
the
cossæans
restored
his
supremacy
in
the
regions
of
the
and
a
campaign
along
the
banks
of
the
euphrates
opened
out
the
road
to
syria
he
rewarded
generously
those
who
had
accompanied
him
on
his
raid
against
elam
after
issuing
regulations
intended
to
maintain
the
purity
of
the
breed
of
horses
for
which
namar
was
celebrated
he
reinstated
in
their
possessions
shamuâ
and
his
son
shamaî
the
descendants
of
one
of
the
priestly
families
of
the
province
granting
them
in
addition
certain
domains
near
upi
at
the
mouth
of
the
turnât
he
confirmed
rittimerodach
in
possession
of
all
his
property
and
reinvested
him
with
all
the
privileges
of
which
the
king
of
elam
had
deprived
him
from
that
time
forward
the
domain
of
bitkarziabku
was
free
of
the
tithe
on
corn
oxen
and
sheep
it
was
no
longer
liable
to
provide
horses
and
mares
for
the
exchequer
or
to
afford
free
passage
to
troops
in
time
of
peace
the
royal
jurisdiction
ceased
on
the
boundary
of
the
fief
the
seignorial
jurisdiction
alone
extended
over
the
inhabitants
and
their
property
chaldæan
prefects
ruled
in
namar
at
khalman
and
at
the
foot
of
the
zagros
and
nebuchadrezzar
no
longer
found
any
to
oppose
him
save
the
king
of
assyria
the
long
reign
of
assurdân
in
assyria
does
not
seem
to
have
been
distinguished
by
any
event
of
importance
either
good
or
bad
it
is
true
he
won
several
towns
on
the
from
the
babylonians
but
then
he
lost
several
others
on
the
to
the
mushku
and
the
loss
on
the
one
side
fully
balanced
the
advantage
gained
on
the
other
hommel
has
proved
by
a
very
simple
calculation
that
assurdân
must
have
been
the
king
in
whose
reign
the
mushku
made
the
inroad
into
the
basin
of
the
upper
tigris
and
of
the
balikh
which
is
mentioned
in
the
of
pileser
these
are
our
authority
for
stating
that
assurdân
was
on
the
throne
for
a
long
period
though
the
exact
length
of
his
reign
is
not
known
his
son
mutakkilnusku
lived
in
assur
at
peace
but
his
grandson
assurîshishî
was
a
mighty
king
conqueror
of
a
score
of
countries
and
the
terror
of
all
rebels
he
scattered
the
hordes
of
the
akhlamê
and
broke
up
their
forces
then
ninip
the
champion
of
the
gods
permitted
him
to
crush
the
lulumê
and
the
in
their
valleys
and
on
their
mountains
covered
with
forests
he
made
his
way
up
to
the
frontiers
of
elam
and
his
encroachments
on
territories
claimed
by
babylon
stirred
up
the
anger
of
the
chaldæans
against
him
nebuchadrezzar
made
ready
to
dispute
their
ownership
with
him
of
mutakkilnusku
himself
has
only
left
us
one
inscription
in
which
he
declares
that
he
had
built
a
palace
in
the
city
of
assyria
smith
discovered
certain
fragments
of
annals
which
he
attributed
to
assurîshishî
the
longest
of
these
tell
of
a
campaign
against
elam
lotz
attributed
them
to
pileser
and
is
supported
in
this
by
most
assyriologists
of
the
day
the
earlier
engagements
went
against
the
assyrians
they
were
driven
back
in
disorder
but
the
victor
lost
time
before
one
of
their
strongholds
and
winter
coming
on
before
he
could
take
it
he
burnt
his
engines
of
war
set
fire
to
his
camp
and
returned
home
next
year
a
rapid
march
carried
him
right
under
the
walls
of
assur
then
assurîshishî
came
to
the
rescue
totally
routed
his
opponent
captured
forty
of
his
chariots
and
drove
him
flying
across
the
frontier
the
war
died
out
of
itself
its
end
being
marked
by
no
treaty
each
side
kept
its
traditional
position
and
supremacy
over
the
tribes
inhabiting
the
basins
of
the
turnât
and
eadanu
the
same
names
reappear
in
line
after
line
of
these
mutilated
annals
and
the
same
definite
enumerations
of
rebellious
tribes
who
have
been
humbled
or
punished
these
kings
of
the
plain
both
ninevite
and
babylonian
were
continually
raiding
the
country
up
and
down
for
centuries
without
ever
arriving
at
any
decisive
result
and
a
detailed
account
of
their
various
campaigns
would
be
as
tedious
reading
as
that
of
the
ceaseless
struggle
between
the
latins
and
sabines
which
fills
the
opening
pages
of
roman
history
posterity
soon
grew
weary
of
them
and
misled
by
the
splendid
position
which
assyria
attained
when
at
the
zenith
of
its
glory
set
itself
to
fabricate
splendid
antecedents
for
the
majestic
empire
established
by
the
latter
dynasties
the
legend
ran
that
at
the
dawn
of
time
a
chief
named
ninos
had
reduced
to
subjection
one
after
the
other
babylonia
media
armenia
and
all

promptly
repressed

set
out
on

of
inspection
through
the
whole
of
her
provinces
with
a
view
to
preventing
the
recurrence
of
similar
outbreaks

left
records

quarrying

through

making

centuries
afterwards
alexander

she

caused
to

she

my
deeds
have
put
me
on
a

with
the
greatest
of

ruled
over
the
dominion
of
ninos
which
extends
eastwards
to
the

hinaman
southwards
to
the
countries
of
incense
and
myrrh
and
northwards
as
far
as
the
sacaa
and
sogdiani
before
my
time
no
assyrian
had
ever
set
eyes
on
the
sea
i
have
seen
four
oceans
to
which
no
mariner
has
ever
sailed
so
far
remote
are
they
i
have
made
rivers
to
flow
where
i
would
have
them
in
the
places
where
they
were
needed
thus
did
i
render
fertile
the
barren
soil
by
watering
it
with
my
rivers
i
raised
up
impregnable
fortresses
and
cut
roadways
through
the
solid
rock
with
the
pick
i
opened
a
way
for
the
wheels
of
my
chariots
in
places
to
which
even
the
feet
of
wild
beasts
had
never
penetrated
and
amidst
all
these
labours
i
yet
found
time
for
my
pleasures
and
for
the
society
of
my
on
discovering
that
her
son
ninyas
was
plotting
her
assassination
she
at
once
abdicated
in
his
favour
in
order
to
save
him
from
committing
a
crime
and
then
transformed
herself
into
a
dove
this
last
incident
betrays
the
goddess
to
us
ninos
and
semiramis
are
purely
mythical
and
their
mighty
deeds
like
those
ascribed
to
ishtar
and
gilgames
must
be
placed
in
the
same
category
as
those
other
fables
with
which
the
babylonian
legends
strive
to
fill
up
the
blank
of
the
prehistoric
period

it
would
be
a
mistake
however
to
neglect
or
despise
them
on
account
of
their
tedious
monotony

the
insignificance

the

sameness
neglected

how
it
came

unconsciously
preparing
her
for
those
campaigns
in
which
she
afterwards
overthrew
all
the
civilized
nations

the
bast
one
after
another
it
was
only
at
the
cost
of
unparalleled
exertions
that
she
succeeded
in
solidly
welding
together
the
various
provinces
within
her
borders

in
kneading
so
to
speak
the
many
and
diverse
elements
of
her
vast
population

compact
mass

in
itself
all
that
was
needful

its

with
which
cossæan
monarchs
had
been
invested
from
the
earliest
times
but
contact
with
the
egyptians
had
modified
the
popular
conception
of
his
personality
his
subjects
were
no
longer
satisfied
to
regard
him
merely
as
a
man
superior
to
his
they
had
come
to
discover
something
of
the
divine
nature
in
him
and
sometimes
identified
him
not
with
assur
the
master
of
all
things
who
occupied
a
position
too
high
above

humanity

deity
whom
the
pharaohs
pretended
to
represent
in
flesh

here
below
his
courtiers
therefore
went
as
far
as
to
call
him
when
they
addressed
him
and
he
himself
adopted
this
title
in
his
inscriptions
nebuchadrezzar
of
babylon
assumes
the
title
of
the
of
his
country
and
hilprecht
rightly
sees
in
this
expression
a
trace
of
egyptian
influences
later
on
assurnazirpal
king
of
assyria
similarly
describes
himself
as
kishshat
the
of
all
tiele
is
of
opinion
that
these
expressions
do
not
necessarily
point
to
any
theory
of
the
actual
incarnation
of
the
god
as
was
the
case
in
egypt
but
that
they
may
be
mere
rhetorical
figures

he
had
only
attained
this
apotheosis
after
death
later
on
he
was
permitted
to
aspire
to
it
during
his
lifetime
the
chaldæans
adopted
the
same
attitude
and
in
both
countries
the
royal
authority
shone
with
the
borrowed
lustre
of
divine
omnipotence
with
these
exceptions

at
court
remained
very
much
the
same

it
had
been
at
nineveh

at
babylon

either
been

to
perform
conscientiously

that
was
required

him
his
chief
amusement
lay
in
the
hunting

reigned
over

had
a
better
right
than

to
boast
of
the
hundreds
of
lions
which
they
had
slain
they
set
out
on
these
hunting
expeditions
with
quite
a
small
army
of
charioteers

infantry

were
often
away
several
days

a

urgent
business
did
not
require

started
their

this
kind
of

demanded
great

mind

steadiness

hand
the
assyrians
were
therefore
trained
to

from

up

such
as

also

supplementary
warrior

could
take
the
place
of
his
comrade
in

accident

if
he
were
wounded

trappings
were
very
simple

there
was
added
to
these
a
thickly
padded
caparison

to
the
horse
by
tags

as
to

were
three

warrior
and
an
attendant
who
protected
the
other
two
with
his
shield
on
some
occasions
a
fourth
was
added
as
an
extra
assistant
the
equipment
of
the
charioteers
was
like
that
of
the
infantry
and
consisted
of
a
jacket
with
imbricated
scales
of
metal
bow
and
arrows
and
a
lance
or
javelin
a
standard
which
served
as
a
for

chariots

set
up
on
the
front

of

succeeded
in

before
he
had
time
to
mobilise

concentrate
his
forces
the
work
of
subduing
him
was
performed
piecemeal
they
devastated
his
fields
robbed
his
orchards
and
marching
all
through
the
night
they
would
arrive
with
such
suddenness
before
one
or
other
of
his
towns
that
he
would
have
no
time
to
organise
a
defence
most
of
their
campaigns
were
mere
forced
marches
across
plains
and
mountains
without
regular
sieges
or
pitched
battles
it
is
possible
that
each
of
these
standards
corresponded
to
some
dignity
of
the
sovereign
the

belonged
to
him

was

army
to
give
his

as

and
to
deliver
up
his
own
sisters
and
daughters
or
those

nobles
for

or
the
domestic
service
of

conqueror
the
unfortunate
prince
soon
resigned
himself
to
this
state
of
servitude
he
would
collect
around
him
and
reorganise
his
scattered
subjects
restore
them
to
their
cities
rebuild
their
walls
replant
the
wasted
orchards
and
sow
the
devastated
fields
a

years
of
relative
peace
and
tranquillity
during
which
he
strove
to
be
forgotten
by
his
conqueror
restored
prosperity
to
his
country
the
population
increased
with
extraordinary
rapidity
and
new
generations
arose
who
unconscious
of
the
disasters
suffered
by
their
predecessors
had
but
one
aim
that
of
recovering
their
independence
we
must
however
beware
of
thinking
that
the
defeat
of
these
tribes
was
as
crushing
or
their
desolation
as
terrible
as
the
testimony
of
the
inscriptions
would
lead
us
to
suppose
the
rulers
of
nineveh
were
but
too
apt
to
relate
that
this
or
that
country
had
been
conquered
and
its
people
destroyed
when
the
assyrian
army
had
remained
merely
a
week
or
a
fortnight
within
its
territory
had
burnt
some
fortified
towns
and
taken
two
or
three
thousand
prisoners
for
example
conquers
the
kummukli
in
the
first
year
of
his
reign
burning
destroying
and
depopulating
the
towns
and
massacring
remainder
of
the
who
had
taken
refuge
in
the
mountains
after
which
in
his
second
campaign
he
again
pillages
burns
destroys
and
depopulates
the
towns
and
again
massacres
the
remainder
of
the
inhabitants
hiding
in
the
mountains
he
makes
the
same
statements
with
regard
to
most
of
the
other
countries
and
peoples
conquered
by
him
but
we
find
them
reappearing
with
renewed
vigour
on
the
scene
soon
after
their
supposed
destruction
if
we
were
to
accept
implicitly
all
that
is
recorded
of
the
assyrian
exploits
in
naîri
or
the
taurus
we
should
be
led
to
believe
that
for
at
least
half
a
century
the
valleys
of
the
upper
tigris
and
middle
euphrates
were
transformed
into
a
desert
each
time
however
that
they
are
subsequently
mentioned
on
the
occasion
of
some
fresh
expedition
they
appear
once
more
covered
with
thriving
cities
and
a
vigorous
population
whose
generals
offer
an
obstinate
resistance
to
the
invaders
we
are
therefore
forced
to
admit
that
the
majority
of
these
expeditions
must
be
regarded
as
mere
raids
the
population
disconcerted
by
a
sudden
attack
would
take
refuge
in
the
woods
or
on
the
mountains
carrying
with
them
their
gods
whom
they
thus
preserved
from
captivity
together
with
a
portion
of
their
treasures
and
cattle
but
no
sooner
had
the
invader
retired
than
they
descended
once
more
into
the
plain
and
returned
to
their
usual
occupations
the
assyrian
victories
thus
rarely
produced
the
decisive
results
which
are
claimed
for
them
they
almost
always
left
the
conquered
people
with
sufficient
energy
and
resources
to
enable
them
to
resume
the
conflict
after
a
brief
interval
and
the
supremacy
which
the
suzerain
claimed
as
a
result
of
his
conquests
was
of
the
most
ephemeral
nature
a
revolt
would
suffice
to
shake
it
while
a
victory
would
be
almost
certain
to
destroy
it
and
once
more
reduce
the
empire
to
the
limits
of
assyria

tukultiabalesharra
familiar
to
us
under

the
first
of

to
stand

before
us
with
any
definite
individuality

in

for
the
hebrew
version
of
the

it
signifies
child

my
by
child
of
the
assyrians
like
the
chaldæans
understood
the
child
of
ninib
we
find
him
in
the
interval
between
two
skirmishes
engaged
in
hunting
lions
or
in
the
pursuit
of
other
wild
beasts
and
we
see
him
lavishing
offerings
on
the
gods
and
enriching
their
temples
with
the
spoils
of
his
victories
these
however
were
not
the
normal
occupations
of
this
sovereign

with
him

merely
an
interlude
in
a
reign
of
conflict
he
led
all
his
expeditions
in
person
undeterred
by
any
consideration
of
fatigue
or
danger
and
scarcely
had
he
returned
from
one
arduous
campaign
than
he
proceeded
to
sketch
the
plan
of
that
for
the
following
year
in
short
he
reigned
only
to
wage
war
his
father
assurîshishi
had
bequeathed
him
not
only
a
prosperous
kingdom
but
a
army
which
he
placed
in
the
field
without
delay
during
the
fifty
years
since
the
mushku
descending
through
the
gorges
of
the
taurus
had
invaded
the
alzi
and
the
assyria
had
not
only
lost
possession
of
all
the
countries
bordering
the
left
bank
of
the
euphrates
but
the
whole
of
kummukh
had
withdrawn
its
allegiance
from
her
and
had
ceased
to
pay
tribute
had
ascended
the
throne
only
a
few
weeks
ere
he
quitted
assur
marched
rapidly
across
eastern
mesopotamia
by
the
usual
route
through
singar
and
nisib
and
climbing
the
chain
of
the
kashiara
near
mardîn
bore
down
into
the
very
heart
of
kummukh
where
twenty
thousand
mushku
under
the
command
of
five
kings
resolutely
awaited
him
he
repulsed
them
in
the
very
first
engagement
and
pursued
them
hotly
over
hill
and
vale
pillaging
the
fields
and
encircling
the
towns
with
trophies
of
human
heads
taken
from
the
prisoners
who
had
fallen
into
his
hands
the
survivors
to
the
number
of
six
thousand
laid
down
their
arms
and
were
despatched
to
assyria
the
king
starting
from
assur
must
have
followed
the
route
through
sindjar
nisib
mardîn
and
diarbekîr
a
road
used
later
by
the
romans
and
still
in
existence
at
the
present
day
as
he
did
not
penetrate
that
year
as
far
as
the
provinces
of
alzi
and
purukuzzi
he
must
have
halted
at
the
commencement
of
the
mountain
district
and
have
beaten
the
allies
in
the
plain
of
before
diarbekîr
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
tigris
the
kummukh
contingents
however
had
been
separated
in
the
rout
from
the
mushku
and
had
taken
refuge
beyond
the
euphrates
near
to
the
fortress
of
shirisha
where
they
imagined
themselves
in
safety
behind
a
rampart
of
mountains
and
forests
managed
by
cutting
a
road
for
his
and
chariots
to
reach
their
retreat
he
stormed
the
place
without
apparent
difficulty
massacred
the
defenders
and
then
turning
upon
the
inhabitants
of
kurkhi
who
were
on
their
way
to
reinforce
the
besieged
drove
their
soldiers
into
the
nâmi
whose
waters
carried
the
corpses
down
to
the
tigris
one
of
their
princes
son
of
had
been
made
prisoner
during
the
action
sent
him
together
with
his
wives
children
treasures
and
gods
to
share
the
captivity
of
the
mushku
then
retracing
his
steps
he
crossed
over
to
the
right
bank
of
the
tigris
and
attacked
the
stronghold
of
urrakhinas
which
crowned
the
summit
of
panâri
the
country
of
the
kurkhi
appears
to
have
included
at
this
period
the
provinces
lying
between
the
and
the
mountains
of
djudî
probably
a
portion
of
the
sophene
the
anzanone
and
the
gordyenc
of
classical
authors
the
vanquished
must
have
crossed
the
tigris
below
diarbekîr
and
have
taken
refuge
beyond
mayafarrikîn
so
that
shirisha
must
be
sought
for
between
the
and
the
in
the
basin
of
the
the
present
nâmi
the
people
by
the
fate
of
their
neighbours
seized
their
idols
and
hid
themselves
within
the
thickets
like
a
flock
of
birds
their
chief
shaditeshub
son
of
khâtusaru
ventured
from
out
of
his
to
meet
the
assyrian
conqueror
and
prostrated
himself
at
his
feet
he
delivered
over
his
sons
and
the
males
of
his
family
as
hostages
and
yielded
up
all
his
possessions
in
gold
and
copper
together
with
a
hundred
and
twenty
slaves
and
cattle
of
all
kinds
thereupon
permitted
him
to
keep
his
principality
under
the
suzerainty
of
assyria
and
such
of
his
allies
as
followed
his
example
obtained
a
similar
concession
the
king
consecrated
the
tenth
of
the
spoil
thus
received
to
the
use
of
his
god
assur
and
also
to
rammân
but
before
returning
to
his
capital
he
suddenly
resolved
to
make
an
expedition
into
the
almost
impenetrable
regions
which
separated
him
from
lake
van
the
name
of
this
father
has
always
been
read
khâtukhi
it
is
a
form
of
the
name
khâtusaru
borne
by
the
hittite
king
in
the
time
of
ramses
ii
the
site
of
urrakhinas
read
by
winckler
urartinas
is
very
uncertain
the
town
was
situated
in
a
territory
which
could
belong
equally
well
to
the
kummukh
or
to
the
kurkhi
and
the
mention
of
the
crossing
of
the
tigris
seems
to
indicate
that
it
was
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
probably
in
the
mountain
group
of
this
district
was
even
more
than
at
the
present
day
a
confused
labyrinth
of
wooded
mountain
ranges
through
which
the
eastern
tigris
and
its
affluents
poured
their
rapid
waters
in
tortuous
curves
as
hitherto
no
army
had
succeeded
in
making
its
way
through
this
territory
with
sufficient
speed
to
surprise
the
fortified
villages
and
scattered
clans
inhabiting
the
valleys
and
mountain
slopes
selected
from
his
force
a
small
troop
of
light
infantry
and
thirty
chariots
with
which
he
struck
into
the
forests
but
on
reaching
the
aruma
he
was
forced
to
abandon
his
chariotry
and
proceed
with
the
only
the
mildîsh
terrified
by
his
sudden
appearance
fell
an
easy
prey
to
the
invader
the
king
scattered
the
troops
hastily
collected
to
oppose
him
set
fire
to
a
few
fortresses
seized
the
peasantry
and
their
flocks
and
demanded
hostages
and
the
usual
tribute
as
a
condition
of
peace
the
mildîsh
of
our
inscription
is
to
be
identified
with
the
country
of
mount
umildîsh
mentioned
by
sargon
of
assyria
in
his
first
campaign
he
thus
reduced
the
upper
and
eastern
half
of
kummukh
namely
the
part
extending
to
the
north
of
the
tigris
while
in
the
following
campaign
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
regions
bounded
by
the
euphrates
and
by
the
western
spurs
of
the
kashiari
the
alzi
and
the
purukuzzi
had
been
disconcerted
by
his
victories
and
had
yielded
him
their
allegiance
almost
without
a
struggle
to
the
southward
the
kashku
and
the
urumi
who
had
to
the
number
of
four
thousand
migrated
from
among
the
khâti
and
compelled
the
towns
of
the
shubarti
to
break
their
alliance
with
the
ninevite
kings
now
made
no
attempt
at
resistance
they
laid
down
their
arms
and
yielded
at
discretion
giving
up
their
goods
and
their
hundred
and
twenty
and
resigning
themselves
to
the
task
of
colonising
a
distant
corner
of
assyria

not
so
easily

entrenched
themselves
within
their
wild
valleys
from
whence
they
had
to
be
ousted
by
sheer
force
in
the
end
they
always
had
to
yield
and
to
undertake
to
pay
an
annual
tribute
the
assyrian
empire
thus
regained
on
this
side
the
countries
which
shalmaneser
had
lost
owing
to
the
absorption
of
his
energies
and
interests
in
the
events
which
were
taking
place
in
chaldæa
in
his
third
campaign

in
bringing
about

pacification
of

provinces
which
shut

and
east
the
kurkhi
did
not

by
the
check

had
received
at

of

tribes
were
stirring
in
kharia
on
the

above
the

their
restlessness
threatened
to
infect
such
of
their
neighbours

had
already

assyrian
yoke

between

sources
of

and
the
the
dread
of
a
similar
fate
impelled
the
neighbouring
inhabitants
of
adaush
to
beg
for
a
truce
which
was
granted
to
them
but
the
people
of
saraush
and
of

who
all
time
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
obey

cut
to

indirectly
pointed
out
by
the
mention
of
the
lower

the
name
of
saradaush
is
perhaps
preserved
in
that
of
surtash
borne
by
the
valley
through
which
runs
one
of
the
tributaries
of
the
lower
zab
beyond
this
again
on
the
banks
of
the
lesser
zab
and
the
confines
of
lulumô
the
principalities
of
muraddash
and
of
saradaush
refused
to
come
to
terms
broke
their
lines
within
sight
of
muraddash
and
entered
the
town
with
the
fugitives
in
the
confusion
which
ensued
this
took
place
about
the
fourth
hour
of
the
day
the
success
was
so
prompt
and
complete
that
the
king
was
inclined
to
attribute
it
to
the
help
of
rammân
and
he
made
an
offering
to
the
temple
of
this
god
at
assur
of
all
the
copper
whether
wrought
or
in
ore
which
was
found
among
the
spoil
of
the
vanquished
he
was
recalled
almost
immediately
after
this
victory
by
a
sedition
among
the
kurkhi
near
the
sources
of
the
tigris
one
of
their
tribes
known
as
the
sugi
who
had
not
as
yet
suffered
from
the
invaders

concentrated
round
their
standards
contingents
from
some
cities
and
the
united
force
was
to
the
number
of
six
thousand
drawn
up
on
mount
khirikhâ
was
again
victorious
and
took
from
them
statues
of
their
gods
which
he
despatched
to
assyria
to
be
distributed
among
the
sanctuaries
of
belît
at
assur
of
anu
bammân
and
of
ishtar
winter
obliged
him
to
suspend
operations
when
he
again
resumed
them
at
the
beginning
of
his
third
year
both
the
kummukh
and
the
kurkhi
were
so
peaceably
settled
that
he
was
able
to
carry
his
expeditions
without
fear
of
danger
further
north
into
the
regions
of
the
upper
euphrates
between
the
halys
and
lake
van
a
district
then
known
as
naîri
he
marched
diagonally
across
the
plain
of
diarbekîr
penetrated
through
dense
forests
climbed
sixteen
mountain
ridges
one
after
the
other
by
paths
hitherto
considered
impracticable
and
finally
crossed
the
euphrates
by
improvised
bridges
this
being
as
far
as
we
know
the
first
time
that
an
assyrian
monarch
had
ventured
into
the
very
heart
of
those
countries
which
had
formerly
constituted
the
hittite
empire
he
found
them
occupied
by
rude
and
warlike
tribes
who
derived
considerable
wealth
from
working
the
mines
and
possessed
each
their
own
special
sanctuary
the
ruins
of
which
still
appear
above
ground
and
invite
the
attention
of
the
explorer
their
fortresses
must
have
all
more
or
less
resembled
that
city
of
the
pterians
which
flourished
for
so
many
ages
just
at
the
bend
of
the
halys
its
site
is
still
marked
by
a
mound

perhaps
of

clumsily
brought
together

each
of
them
when
examined
separately
is
remarkable
for
its
style

execution
the
king
has
a
dignified
bearing
in
spite
of
his
large
head
round
eyes
and
the
unskilful
way
in
which
his
arms
are
set
on
his
body
the
figure
of
the
god
is
not
standing
firmly
on
both
feet
but
the
sculptor
has
managed
to
invest
him
with
an
air
of
grandeur
and
an
expression
of
vigour

which
reminds
us
of
certain
types
of
the
greek
hercules

probably
attracted
to
asia
minor
as
much
by
considerations
of
mercantile
interest
as
by
the
love

it
would
indeed
have
been
an
incomparable
gain
for
him
had
he
been
able
if
not
to
seize
the
mines
themselves
at
least
to
come
into
such
close
proximity
to
them
that
he
would
be
able
to
monopolise
their
entire
output

at
the

time
to
lay
hands
on
the
great
commercial
highway
to
the
trade

the

a
certain
sense
of
unity
still
lingered
among

continual
feuds

constituted
in
fact
a
sort

loose
confederation

members
never

one
another

they
were
threatened
by
a
common
enemy
as
soon
as
the
news

an
assyrian
invasion
reached
them
they
at
once
put
aside
quarrels
and
combined
to
oppose
the
invader

and
more
particularly
the

between

and

at
the
present

several
scholars
have
returned
to
the
theory
which
makes
it
the
black
sea
presented
some
of
them
in
chains
to
the
god
shamash
he
extorted
an
oath
of
vassalage
from
them
forced
them
to
give
up
their
children
as
hostages
and
laid
a
tax
upon
them
of
stallions
and
bulls
after
which
he
permitted
them
to
return
to
their
respective
towns
he
had
however
singled
out
from
among
them
to
grace
his
own
triumph
sini

dayana
the
only
chief
among
them
who
had
offered
him
an
obstinate
resistance

even
he
was
granted
his
liberty
after
he
had
been
carried
captive
to

delattre

shown
that
it
was
the
last
and
most
westerly
of
kingdoms
conquered
by
and
that
it
was
consequently
enclosed
between
the
and
the
euphrates
proper
before
returning
to
the
capital
attacked
khanigalbat
and
appeared
before
milidia
as
the
town
attempted
no
defence
he
spared
it
and
contented
himself
with
levying
a
small
contribution
upon
its
inhabitants
this
expedition
was
rather
of
the
nature
of
a
reconnaissance
than
a
conquest
but
it
helped
to
convince
the
king
of
the
difficulty
of
establishing
any
permanent
suzerainty
over
the
country
the
asiatic
peoples
were
quick
to
bow
before
a
sudden
attack
but
no
sooner
had
the
conqueror
departed
than
those
who
had
sworn
him
eternal
fealty
sought
only
how
best
to
break
their
oaths
the
tribes
in
immediate
proximity
to
those
provinces
which
had
been
long
subject
to
the
assyrian
rule
were
intimidated
into
showing
some
respect
for
a
power
which
existed
so
close
to
their
own
borders
but
those
further
removed
from
the
seat
of
government
felt
a
certain
security
in
their
distance
from
it
and
were
tempted
to
revert
to
the
state
of
independence
they
had
enjoyed
before
the
conquest
so
that
unless
the
sovereign
by
a
fresh
campaign
promptly
made
them
realise
that
their
disaffection
would
not
remain
unpunished
they
soon
forgot
their
feudatory
condition
and
the
duties
which
it
entailed
three
years
of
merciless
conflict
with
obstinate
and
warlike
mountain
tribes
had
severely
tried
the
assyrian
army
if
it
had
not
worn
out
the
sovereign
the
survivors
of
so
many
battles
were
in
sore
need
of
a
repose
the
gaps
left
by
death
had
to
be
filled
and
both
infantry
and
chariotry
needed
the
of
their
corps
the
fourth
year
of
the
reign
therefore
was
employed
almost
entirely
in
this
work
of
reorganisation
we
find
only
the
record
of
a
raid
of
a
few
weeks
against
the
akhlamî
and
other
nomadic
aramæans
situated
beyond

mesopotamian
steppes

assyrians
spread
over
the
district
between
the
frontiers
of
sukhi
and
the
fords
of
carchemish
for
a
whole
day
killing
all
who
resisted
sacking
the
villages
and
laying

fugitives
escaped
over

hoping
that
they
would
be
secure

crossed
the

on

supported

six

opened
their
gates
to
him
without
having
ventured
to
strike
a
blow
and
he
quitted
the
country

with
spoil
before
the
kings
of
the
surrounding
cities
had
had
time
to
recover
from
their
alarm

of
this
expedition
was
for
merely
an
interlude
between
two
more
serious
campaigns
and
with
the
beginning
of
his
fifth
year
he
reappeared
in
the
provinces
of
the
upper
euphrates
to
complete
his
conquest
of
them
he
began
by
attacking
and
devastating
musri
which
lay
close
to
the
territory
of
milid
while
thus
occupied
he
was
harassed
by
bands
of
kumani
he
turned
upon
them
overcame
them
and
imprisoned
the
remainder
of
them
in
the
fortress
of
arini
at
the
foot
of
mount
aisa
where
he
forced
them
to
kiss
his
feet
his
victory
over
them
however
did
not
disconcert
their
neighbours
the
bulk
of
the
kumani
whose
troops
had
scarcely
suffered
in
the
engagement
fortified
themselves
on
mount
tala
to
the
number
of
twenty
thousand
the
king
carried
the
heights
by
assault
and
hotly
pursued
the
fugitives
as
far
as
the
range
of
kharusa
before
musri
where
the
fortress
of
khunusa
afforded
them
a
retreat
behind
its
triple
walls
of
brick
the
king
nothing
daunted
broke
his
way
through
them
one
after
another
demolished
the
ramparts
razed
the
houses
and
strewed
the
ruins
with
salt
he
then
constructed
a
chapel
of
brick
as
a
sort
of
trophy
and
dedicated
within
it
what
was
known
as
a

thunderbolt
being
an
image
of
the
missile
which
eammân
the
god
of
thunder
brandished
in
the
face

enemies
an

engraved

object
recorded
the

threatened
with
every

malediction
the
individual
whether

should
dare

rebuild

the

was
not
long
in
reaching
the

the
egyptian
monarch
then
reigning
at
tanis
was
thus
made
acquainted
with
the
fact
that
there
had
arisen
in
syria
a
new
power
before
which
his
own
was
not
unlikely
to
give
way
in
former
times
such
news
would
have
led
to
a
war
between
the
two

the
time
had
gone
by

take
up

at
the

her
former
renown

her
authority

isthmus

purely
traditional
the
tanite
pharaoh
had
come
to
accept
with
resignation
the
change
in
the
fortunes
of
egypt
and
he
therefore
contented
himself
with
forwarding
to
the
assyrian
conqueror

one
of
the
syrian
coasting
vessels

unexpected
homage

northern
tribes
prevented
his
improving
the
occasion
by
an
advance
into

occupied
his
attention
on
two

a

only

the

must
therefore
be

to
the
vth

we
gather
that
he
attacked
a
whole
series
of
strongholds
some
of

names
have
a
cossæan
ring
about
them
such
as
madkiu
sudrun
ubrukhundu

his
advance
in
this
direction
must
have
considerably
provoked
the
chaldæans
and
indeed
it
was
not
long
before
actual
hostilities
broke
out
between
the
two
nations
the
first
engagement
took
place
in
the
valley

in

province
of

any
decisive
result

in

who
was
at
this
time
reigning
in
chaldæa
was
like
his
ancestor
nebuchadrezzar
a
brave
and
warlike
sovereign
he
appears
at
first
to
have
given
way
under
the
blow
thus
dealt
him
and
to
have
acknowledged
the
suzerainty
of
his
rival
who
thereupon
assumed
the
title
of
lord
of
the
four
houses
of
the
world
and
united
under
a
single
empire

lasted
for

supported
by
the
chaldæan
nobility
succeeded

expelling
the
intruders
from

the
assyrians
however
did
not
allow
themselves
to
be
driven
out
without
a
struggle
but
fortune
turned
against
them
they
were
beaten
and
the
conqueror
inflicted
on
the
assyrian
gods
the
humiliation
to
which
they
had
so
often
subjected
those
of
other
nations
he
took
the
statues
of
eammân
and
shala
from
ekallati
carried
them
to
babylon
and
triumphantly
set
them
up
within
the

of
bel
there
they
remained
in
captivity
for
years
did
not
long
survive
this
disaster
for
he
died
about
the
year
and
two
of
his
sons
succeeded
him
on
the
throne
the
elder
had
neither
sufficient
energy
nor
resources
to
resume
the
offensive
and
remained
a
passive
spectator
of
the
revolutions
which
distracted
babylon
we
know
this
fact
from
the
inscription
of
bavian
in
which
sennacherib
boasts
of
having
brought
back
these
statues
to
assyria
after
they
had
been
years
in
the
possession
of
the
enemy
i
have
followed
the
commonly
received
opinion
which
places
the
defeat
of
after
the
taking
of
babylon
others
think
that
it
preceded
the
decisive
victory
of
the
assyrians
it
is
improbable
that
if
the
loss
of
the
statues
preceded
the
decisive
victory
the
assyrian
conquerors
should
have
left
their
gods
prisoners
in
a
babylonian
temple
and
should
not
have
brought
them
back
immediately
to
ekallati
the
death
of
must
have
followed
quickly
on
the
victory
of
babylon
the
contents
of
the
inscription
of
bavian
permit
us
to
fix
the
taking
of
ekallati
by
the
chaldæans
about
the
year
we
shall
not
be
far
wrong
in
supposing
to
have
reigned
six
or
eight
years
after
his
defeat
i
followed
the
usually
received
classification
it
is
however
possible
that
we
must
reverse
the
order
of
the
sovereigns
had
been
followed
by
his
son
but
this
prince
was
soon
dethroned
by
the
people
and
a
man
of
base
extraction
seized
the
crown
the
name
of
the
babylonian
king
has
been
variously
read
and
not
only
extended
to
this
usurper
the
friendly
relations
he
had
kept
up
with
the
legitimate
sovereign
but
he
asked
for
the
hand
of
his
daughter
in
marriage
and
the
rich
dowry
which
she
brought
her
husband
no
doubt
contributed
to
the
continuation
of
his
pacific
policy
he
appears
also
to
have
kept
possession
of
all
the
parts
of
mesopotamia
and
kammukh
conquered
by
his
father
and
it
is
possible
that
he
may
have
penetrated
beyond
the
euphrates
his
brother
does
not
appear
to
have
left
any
more
definite
mark
upon
history
than
he
decorated
the
temples
built
by
his
predecessors
but
beyond
this
we
have
no
certain
record
of
his
achievements
we
know
nothing
of
the
kings
who
followed
him
their
names
even
having
been
lost
but
about
a
century
and
a
half
after
a
certain
assurirba
seems
to
have
crossed
northern
syria
and
following
in
the
footsteps
of
his
great
ancestor
to
have
penetrated
as
far
as
the
mediterranean
on
the
rocks
of
mount
amanus
facing
the
sea
he
left
a
triumphal
inscription
in
which
he
set
forth
the
mighty
deeds
he
had
accomplished
this
is
merely
a
gleam
out
of
the
murky
night
which
envelops
his
history
and
the
testimony
of
one
of
his
descendants
informs
us
that
his
good
fortune
soon
forsook
him
the
aramaeans
wrested
from
him
the
fortresses
of
pitru
and
mutkînu
which
commanded
both
banks
of
the
euphrates
near
carchemish
nor
did
the
retrograde
movement
slaken
after
his
time
assyria
slowly
wasted
away
down
to
the
end
of
the
xth
century
and
but
for
the
simultaneous
decadence
of
the
chaldaeans
its
downfall
would
have
been
complete
but
neither
nor
his
successor
was
able
to
take
advantage
of
its
weakness
discord
and
want
of
energy
soon
brought
about
their
own
ruin
the
dynasty
of
pashê
disappeared
towards
the
middle
of
the
xth
century
and
a
family
belonging
to
the
of
the
took
its
place
it
had
continued
for
about
one
hundred
and
years
and
had
produced
eleven
kings
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
draw
up
an
exact
list
of
this
dynasty
and
attempt
to
do
so
contains
more
than
one
doubtful
name
the
following
list
is
very
imperfect
and
doubtful
but
the
best
that
our
present
knowledge
enables
us
to
put
forward
illustration
table
of
kings
what
were
the
causes
of
this
depression
from
which
babylon
suffered
at
almost
regular
intervals
as
though
stricken
with
some
periodic
malady
the
main
reason
soon
becomes
apparent
if
we
consider
the
nature
of
the
country
and
the
material
conditions
of
its
existence
chaldæa
was
neither
extensive
enough
nor
sufficiently
populous
to
afford
a
solid
basis
for
the
ambition
of
her
princes
since
nearly
every
man
capable
of
bearing
arms
was
enrolled
in
the
army
the
chaktean
kings
had
no
difficulty
in
raising
at
a
notice
a
force
which
could
be
employed
to
repel
an
invasion
or
make
a
sudden
attack
on
some
distant
territory
it
was
in
schemes
which
required
prolonged
and
sustained
effort
that
they
felt
the
drawbacks
of
their
position
in
that
age
of
combats
the
mortality
in
battle
was
very
high
forced
marches
through
forests
and
across
mountains
entailed
a
heavy
loss
of
men
and
three
or
four
consecutive
campaigns
against
a
stubborn
foe
soon
reduced
an
army
to
a
condition
of
dangerous
weakness
recruits
might
be
obtained
to
fill
the
earlier
vacancies
in
the
ranks
but
they
soon
grew
fewer
and
fewer
if
time
was
not
given
for
recovery
after
the
opening
victories
in
the
struggle
and
the
supply
eventually
ceased
if
operations
were
carried
on
beyond
a
certain
period
the
total
duration
of
the
dynasty
was
according
to
the
royal
canon
years
months
peiser
has
shown
that
this
is
a
mistake
and
he
proposes
to
correct
it
to
years
months
and
this
is
accepted
by
most
a
reign
which
began
brilliantly
often
came
to
an
impotent
conclusion
owing
to
the
king
having
failed
to
economise
his
reserves
and
the
generations
which
followed
compelled
to
adopt
a
strictly
defensive
attitude
vegetated
in
a
sort
of
anaemic
condition
until
the
had
brought
the
proportion
of
males
up
to
a
figure
sufficiently
high
to
provide
the
material
for
a
fresh
army
when
nebuchadrezzar
made
war
upon
assurîshishî
he
was
still
weak
from
the
losses
he
had
incurred
during
the
campaign
against
elam
and
could
not
conduct
his
attack
with
the
same
vigour
as
had
gained
him
victory
on
the
banks
of
the
ulaî
in
the
first
year
he
only
secured
a
few
indecisive
advantages
and
in
the
second
he
succumbed
was
suffering
from
the
reverses
sustained
by
his
predecessors
when
provoked
him
to
war
and
though
he
succeeded
in
giving
a
good
account
of
an
adversary
who
was
himself
exhausted
by
dearly
bought
successes
he
left
to
his
descendants
a
kingdom
which
had
been
drained
of
its
last
drop
of
blood
the
same
reason
which
explains
the
decadence
of
babylon
shows
us
the
cause
of
the
periodic
eclipses
undergone
by
assyria
after
each
outburst
of
her
warlike
spirit
she
too
had
to
pay
the
penalty
of
an
ambition
which
was
out
of
all
proportion
to
her
resources
the
mighty
deeds
of
shalmaneser
and
were
as
a
natural
consequence
followed
by
a
state
of
complete
prostration
under
tukultiassurbel
and
assurnîrarî
the
country
was
now
forced
to
pay
for
the
glories
of
assurîshishî
and
of
by
falling
into
an
inglorious
state
of
languor
and
depression
its
kings
conscious
that
their
rule
must
be
necessarily
precarious
as
long
as
they
did
not
possess
a
larger
stock
of
recruits
to
fall
back
on
set
their
wits
to
work
to
provide
by
various
methods
a
more
adequate
reserve
while
on
one
hand
they
installed
native
assyrians
in
the
more
suitable
towns
of
conquered
countries
on
the
other
they
imported
whole
hordes
of
alien
prisoners
chosen
for
their
strength
and
courage
and
settled
them
down
in
districts
by
the
banks
of
the
tigris
and
the
zab
we
do
not
know
what
eammânirâni
and
shalmaneser
may
have
done
in
this
way
but
undoubtedly
introduced
thousands
of
the
mushku
the
urumseans
the
people
of
kummukh
and
naîri
and
his
example
was
followed
by
all
those
of
his
successors
whose
history
has
come
down
to
us
one
might
have
expected
that
such
an
invasion
of
foreigners
still
smarting
under
the
sense
of
defeat
might
have
brought
with
it
an
element
of
discontent
or
rebellion
far
from
it
they
accepted
their
exile
as
a
judgment
of
the
gods
which
the
gods
alone
had
a
right
to
reverse
and
did
their
best
to
mitigate
the
hardness
of
their
lot
by
rendering
unhesitating
obedience
to
their
masters
their
grandchildren
born
in
the
midst
of
assyrians
became
assyrians
themselves
and
if
they
did
not
entirely
divest
themselves
of
every
trace
of
their
origin
at
any
rate
became
so
closely
identified
with
the
country
of
their
adoption
that
it
was
difficult
to
distinguish
them
from
the
native
race
the
assyrians
who
were
sent
out
to
colonise
recently
acquired
provinces
were
at
times
exposed
to
serious
risks
now
and
then
instead
of
absorbing
the
natives
among
whom
they
lived
they
were
absorbed
by
them
which
meant
a
loss
of
so
much
fighting
strength
to
the
mother
country
even
under
the
most
favourable
conditions
a
considerable
time
must
have
passed
before
they
could
succeed
in
assimilating
to
themselves
the
races
amongst
whom
they
lived
at
last
however
a
day
would
dawn
when
the
process
of
incorporation
was
accomplished
and
assyria
having
increased
her
area
and
resources
twofold
found
herself
ready
to
endure
to
the
end
the
strain
of
conquest
in
the
interval
she
suffered
from
a
scarcity
of
fighting
men
due
to
the
losses
incurred
in
her
victories
and
must
have
congratulated
herself
that
her
traditional
foe
was
not
in
a
position
to
take
advantage
of
this
fact
the
first
wave
of
the
assyrian
invasion
had
barely
touched
syria
it
had
swept
hurriedly
over
the
regions
in
the
north
and
then
flowed
southwards
to
return
no
more
so
that
the
northern
races
were
able
to
resume
the
wonted
tenor
of
their
lives
for
centuries
after
this
their
condition
underwent
no
change
there
was
the
same
repetition
of
dissension
and
intrigue
the
same
endless
succession
of
alliances
and
battles
without
any
signal
advantage
on
either
side
the
hittites
still
held
northern
syria
carchemish
was
their
capital
and
more
than
one
town
in
its
vicinity
preserved
the
tradition
of
their
dress
their
language
their
arts
and
their
culture
in
full
vigour
the
greek
legends
tell
us
vaguely
of
some
sort
of
cilician
empire
which
is
said
to
have
brought
the
eastern
and
central
provinces
of
asia
minor
into
subjection
about
ten
centuries
before
our
era
solinus
relying
on
the
indirect
evidence
of
hecatseus
of
miletus
tells
us
that
cilicia
extended
not
only
to
the
countries
afterwards
known
as
cataonia
commagene
and
syria
but
also
included
lydia
media
armenia
pamphylia
and
cappadocia
the
conquests
of
the
assyrian
kings
must
have
greatly
reduced
its
area
i
am
of
opinion
that
the
tradition
preserved
by
hecatous
referred
both
to
the
kingdom
of
sapalulu
and
to
that
of
the
monarchs
of
this
second
epoch
is
there
any
serious
foundation
for
such
a
belief
and
must
we
assume
that
there
existed
at
this
time
and
in
this
part
of
the
world
a
kingdom
similar
to
that
of
sapalulu
assyria
was
recruiting
its
forces
chaldæa
was
kept
inactive

its
helplessness

was

actor
of
the
first
rank
to
fill
the
stage
now
was
the
opportunity
for
a
performer
to
come
on
the
scene
and
play
such
a
part
as
his
abilities
permitted
the
cilician
conquest
if
this
be
indeed
the
date
at
which
it
took
place
had
the
boards
to
itself
for
a
hundred
years
after
the
defeat
of
assurirba
the
time
was
too
short
to
admit
of
its
striking
deep
root
in
the
country
its
leaders
and
men
were
moreover
closely
related
to
the
syrian
hittites
the
language
they
spoke
was
if
not
precisely
the
hittite
at
any
rate
a
dialect
of
it
their
customs
were
similar
if
perhaps
somewhat
less
refined
as
is
often
the
case
with
mountain
races
when
compared
with
the
peoples
of
the
plain
we
are
tempted
to
conclude
that
some
of
the
monuments
found
south
of
the
taurus
were
their
handiwork
or
at
any
rate
date
from
their
time
for
instance
the
ruined
palace
at
sinjirli
the
lower
portions
of
which
are
ornamented
with
pictures
similar
to
those
at
pteria
representing
processions
of
animals
some
real
others
fantastic
men
armed
with
lances
or
bending
the
bow
and
processions
of
priests
or
officials
then
there
is
the
great
lion
at
marash
which
stands
erect
with
menacing
head
its
snarling
lips
exposing
the
teeth
its
body
is
seamed
with
the
long
lines
of
an
inscription
in
the
asiatic
character
in
imitation
of
those
with
which
the
bulls
in
the
assyrian
palaces
are
covered
these
cilicians
gave
an
impulse
to
the
civilization
of
the
khâti
which
they
sorely
needed
for
the
semitic
races

they
had
kept
in
subjection
for
centuries

them
hard
on
all
the
territory
over

they

dynasty
sheshonq
after
reaching
the
israelites
in
their
wanderings
had
come
into
contact
with
various
bedawin
tribes
kenites
jerahmelites
edomites
and
midianites
with
whom
they
had
in
turn
fought
or
allied
themselves
according
to
the
exigencies
of
their
pastoral
life
continual
skirmishes
had
taught
them
the
art
of
war
their
numbers
had
rapidly
increased
and
with
this
increase
came
a
consciousness
of
their
own
strength
so
that
after
a
lapse
of
two
or
three
generations
they
may
be
said
to
have
constituted
a
considerable
nation
its
component
elements
were
not
however
firmly
welded
together
they
consisted
of
an
indefinite
number
of
clans
which
were
again
subdivided
into
several
families
each
of
these
families
had
its
chief
or
to
whom
it
rendered
absolute
obedience
while
the
united
chiefs
formed
an
assembly
of
elders
who
administered
justice
when
required
and
settled
any
differences
which
arose
among
their
respective
followers
the
clans
in
their
turn
were
grouped
into
tribes
according
to
certain
affinities
which
they
mutually
recognised
or
which
may
have
been
fostered
by
daily
intercourse
on
a
common
soil
but
the
ties
which
bound
them
together
at
this
period
were
of
the
most
slender
character
it
needed
some
special
event
such
as
a
projected
migration
in
search
of
fresh
pasturage
or
an
expedition
against
a
turbulent
neighbour
or
a
threatened
invasion
by
some
stranger
to
rouse
the
whole
tribe
to
corporate
action
at
such
times
they
would
elect
a
or
ruler
the
duration
of
whose
functions
ceased
with
the
emergency
which
had
called
him
into
office
the
tribe
was
designated
by
two
words
signifying
or
the
word
first
applied
to
the
chiefs
of
the
tribes
xxxiv
iv
ii
became
after
the
captivity
the
title
of
the
chiefs
of
israel
who
could
not
be
called
owing
to
the
foreign
suzerainty
i
both
clans
and
tribes
were
designated
by
the
name
of
some
ancestor
from
whom
they
claimed
to
be
descended
and
who
appears
in
some
cases
to
have
been
a
god
for
whom
they
had
a
special
devotion
some
writers
have
believed
that
this
was
also
the
origin
of
the
names
given
to
several
of
the
tribes
such
as
gad
fortune
or
of
the
totems
of
the
hyena
and
the
dog
in
arabic
and
hebrew
and
gad
simeon
and
caleb
were
severally
the
ancestors
of
the
families
who
ranged
themselves
under
their
respective
names
and
the
eponymous
heroes
of
all
the
tribes
were
held
to
have
been
brethren
sons
of
one
father
and
under
the
protection
of
one
god
he
was
known
as
the
jahveh
with
whom
abraham
of
old
had
made
a
solemn
covenant
his
was
mount
sinai
or
mount
seîr
and
he
revealed
himself
in
the
storm
his
voice
was
as
the
thunder
shaketh
the
wilderness
his
breath
was
as
consuming
fire
and
he
was
decked
with
light
with
a
when
his
anger
was
aroused
he
withheld
the
dew
and
rain
from
watering
the
earth
but
when
his
wrath
was
appeased
the
heavens
again
poured
their
fruitful
showers
upon
the
fields
simeon
is
derived
by
some
from
a
word
which
at
times
denotes
a
hyena
at
others
a
cross
between
a
dog
and
a
hyena
according
to
arab
lexicography
with
regard
to
caleb
renan
prefers
a
different
interpretation
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
shortened
form
of
kalbel
and
of
is
a
strong
expression
to
denote
the
devotion
of
a
tribe
to
its
patron
god
cf
the
graphic
description
of
the
signs
which
accompanied
the
manifestations
of
jahveh
in
the
of
deborah
and
also
in
xix
see
where
the
conflict
between
elijah
and
the
prophets
of
baal
for
the
obtaining
of
rain
is
described
he
is
described
as
being
a
god
brooking
no
rival
and
the
iniquity
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
unto
the
third
and
fourth
we
hear
of
his
having
been
adored
under
the
figure
of
a
and
of
his
spirit
inspiring
his
prophets
as
well
as
of
the
anointed
stones
which
were
dedicated
in
his
honour
the
common
ancestor
of
the
nation
was
acknowledged
to
have
been
jacob
who
by
his
wrestling
with
god
had
obtained
the
name
of
israel
the
people
were
divided
theoretically
into
as
many
tribes
as
he
had
sons
but
the
number
twelve
to
which
they
were
limited
does
not
entirely
correspond
with
all
that
we
know
up
to
the
present
time
of
these
of
some
of
the
tribes
appear
never
to
have
had
any
political
existence
as
for
example
that
of
levi
or
they
were
merged
at
an
early
date
into
some
as
in
the
case
of
reuben
with
gad
others
such
as
ephraim
manasseh
benjamin
and
judah
apparently
did
not
attain
their
normal
development

after
the
events
of
which
there
are
two
separate
accounts
combined
in

with
simeon
he
appears
to
have
revenged
the
violation
of
his
sister

by
a
massacre
of
the
shechemites

the
dispersion
alluded
to

of

xlix
cf
xxxv
the
jewish
chroniclers
attempted
by
various
combinations
to
prove
that
the
sacred
number
of
tribes
was
the
correct
one
at
times
they
included
levi
in
the
list
in
which
case
joseph
was
reckoned
as
one
while
on
other
occasions
levi
or
simeon
was
omitted
when
for
joseph
would
be
substituted
his
two
sons
ephraim
and
manasseh
in
addition
to
this
the
tribes
were
very
unequal
in
size
ephraim
gad
and
manasseh
comprised
many
powerful
and
wealthy
families
dan
on
the
contrary
contained
so
few
that
it
was
sometimes
reckoned
as
a
mere
clan
as
for
instance
in
blessing
xlix
and
in
the
enumeration
of
the
sons
at
the
time
of
his
journey
to
egypt

the

deut
xxxiii
where
simeon
is
omitted
from
among
the
tribes
blessed
by
moses
before
his
death
the
tribal
organisation
had
not
reached
its
full
development
at
the
time
of
the
sojourn
in
the
desert
the
tribes
of
joseph
and
judah
who
subsequently
played
such
important
parts
were
at
that
period
not
held
in
any
particular
estimation
reuben
on
the
other
hand
exercised
a
sort
of
right
of
priority
over
the
rest
this
conclusion
is
drawn
from
the
position
of
eldest
son
given
to
him
in
all
the
genealogies
enumerating
the
children
of
jacob
stade
on
the
contrary
is
inclined
to
believe
that
this
place
of
honour
was
granted
to
him
on
account
of
the
smallness
of
his
family
to
prevent
any
jealousy
arising
between
the
more
powerful
tribes
such
as
ephraim
and
judah

the
territory
which
they
occupied
soon
became
insufficient
to
support
their
numbers
and
they
sought
to
exchange
it
for
a
wider
area
such
as
was
offered
by
the
neighbouring
provinces
of
southern
syria
pharaoh
at
this
time
exercised
no
authority
over
this
region
and
they
were
therefore
no
longer
in
fear
of
opposition
from
his
troops
the
latter
had
been
recalled
to
egypt
and
it
is
doubtful
even
whether
he
retained
possession
of
the
shephelah
by
means
of
his
zakkala
and
philistine
colonies
the
hebrews
at
any
rate
had
nothing
to
fear
from
him
so
long
as
they
respected
gaza
and
ascalon
they
began
by
attempting
to
possess
themselves
of
the
provinces
around
hebron
in
the
direction
of
the
dead
sea
and
we
read
that
before
entering
them
they
sent
out
spies
to
reconnoitre
and
report
on
the
country
its
population
had
undergone
considerable
modifications
since
the
israelites
had
quitted
goshen
the
amorites
who
had
seriously
suffered
from
the
incursions
of
asiatic
hordes
and
had
been
constantly
harassed
by
the
attacks
of
the
aramæans
had
abandoned
the
positions
they
had
formerly
occupied
on
the
banks
of
the
orontes
and
the
litany
and
had
moved
southwards
driving
the
canaanites
before
them
their
advance
was
accelerated
as
the
resistance
opposed
to
their
hordes
became
lessened
under
the
successors
of
ramses
until
at
length
all
opposition
was
withdrawn
they
had
possessed
themselves

regions

the

were
everywhere
victorious
but
our
information
is
confined
to
this
bare
fact
soon
after
their
victory
however
we
find
the
territory
they
had
invaded
divided
into
two
kingdoms
in

north
that
of
bashan
which
comprised
besides

of
heshbon
containing
the
district
lying

they
seem
to
have
made

elsewhere
they

into

and
penetrated
gradually
as
far
south
as
the
borders

we
find
them
establishing
petty
kings
among
the
of
shechem
around
hebron
on
the
confines
of
the
negeb
and
the
shephelah
when
the
hebrew
tribes
ventured
to
push
forward
in
a
direct
line
northwards
they
came
into
collision
with
the
advance
posts
of
the
amorite
population
and
suffered
a
severe
defeat
under
the
walls
of
hormah
the
check
thus
received
however
did
not
discourage
them
as
a
direct
course
was
closed
to
them
they
turned
to
the
right
and
followed
first
the
southern
and
then
the
eastern
shores
of
the
red
sea
till
they
reached

the
extension

a
name
in

taking

protection

became
their
leader
brought
them
across

dryshod
not
far
from

a

many

age
of

in
showing
that
the
ties
which
bound
the
twelve
tribes
together
were
speedily
dissolved
while
their
fidelity
and
obedience
to

were
relaxed

between

allowed
the

to

often
powerless
to
retain
their
independence
in

of

as
the

had
spoken
and
as
the

had

unto
them
and
they
were
sore
distressed
and
the
lord
raised
up
judges
which
saved
them
out
of

of
those
that
spoiled

and
yet
they
hearkened
not
unto
their
judges
for
they
went
after
other
gods
and
bowed
themselves
down
unto
them
they
turned
aside
quickly
out
of
the
way
wherein
their
fathers
walked
obeying
the
commandments
of
the
lord
but
they
did
not
so
and
when
the
lord
raised
them
up
judges
then
the
lord
was
with
the
judge
and
saved
them
out
of
the
hand
of
their
enemies
all
the
days
of
the

it
repented
the

because
of
their
groaning
by
reason
of
them
that
oppressed
them
and
vexed
them
but
it
came
to
pass
when
the
judge
was
dead

they
turned
back
and
dealt
more
corruptly
than
their
fathers
in
following
other

to
serve

bow
down
unto

they
ceased
not
from
their
doings

history
of

the
unity
and
precision
with
which
we
are
at

tempted
to
credit

judges
ii
the
israelites
when
transplanted
into
the
promised
land
did
not
immediately
lose
the
nomadic
habits
they
had
acquired
in
the
desert
they
retained
the
customs
and
prejudices
they
had
inherited
from
their
fathers
and
for
many
years
treated
the
peasantry
whose
fields
they
had
devastated
with
the
same
disdain
that
the
bedawin
of
our
own
day
living
in
the
saddle
lance
in
hand
shows
towards
the
fellahîn
who
till
the
soil
and
bend
patiently
over
the
plough
the
clans
as
of
old
were
impatient
of
all
regular
authority
each
tribe
tended
towards
an
isolated
autonomy
a
state
of
affairs
which
merited
reprisals
from
the
natives
and
encouraged
hatred
of
the
intruders
and
it
was
only
when
the
canaanite
oppression
became
unendurable
that
those
who
suffered
most
from
it
united
themselves
to
make
a
common
effort
and
rallied
for
a
moment
round
the
chief
who
was
ready
to
lead
them
many
of
these
liberators
must
have
acquired
an
ephemeral
popularity
and
then
have
sunk
into
oblivion
together
with
the
two
or
three
generations
who
had
known
them
those
whose
memory
remained
green
among
their
kinsmen
were
known
by
posterity
as
the
judges
of
israel
the
word
which
has
been
adopted
to
designate
these
rulers
is
somewhat
misleading
as
it
suggests
the
idea
of
an
organized
civil
magistracy
the
word
the
same
that
we
meet
with
in
classical
times
under
the
form
had
indeed
that
sense
but
its
primary
meaning
denotes
a
man
invested
with
an
absolute
authority
regular
or
otherwise
it
would
be
better
translated
prince
these
judges
were
not
magistrates
invested
with
official
powers
and
approved
by
the
whole
nation
or
rulers
of
a
highly
organised
republic
chosen
directly
by
god
or
by
those
inspired
by
him
they
were
merely
local
chiefs
heroes
to
their
own
immediate
tribe
well
known
in
their
particular
surroundings
but
often
despised
by
those
only
at
a
short
distance
from
them
some
of
them
have
left
only
a
name
behind
them
such
as
shamgar
ibzan
tola
elon
and
abdon
indeed
some
scholars
have
thrown
doubts
on
the
personality
of
a
few
of
them
as
for
instance
jair
whom
they
affirm
to
have
personified
a
gileadite
clan
and
othnîel
who
is
said
to
represent
one
of
the
kenite
families
associated
with
the
children
of
israel
others
again
have
come
down
to
us
through
an
atmosphere
of
popular
tradition
the
elements
of
which
modern
criticism
has
tried
in
vain
to
analyse
of
such
unsettled
and
turbulent
times
we
can
not
expect
an
uninterrupted
history
some
salient
episodes
alone
remain
spread
over
a
period
of
nearly
two
centuries
and
from
these
we
can
gather
some
idea
of
the
progress
made
by
the
israelites
and
observe
their
stages
of
transition
from
a
cluster
of
hordes
to
a
settled
nation
ripe
for
monarchy
the
name
tola
occurs
as
that
of
one
of
the
clans
of
issachar

elon
was
one
of
the

however
believes
that
the

an
almost
continuous
line
and
that
there
merely
lacks
a
descent
from
father
to
son

make
of
them
an
actual
the
chronology
of
the
of
appears
to
cover
more
than
four
centuries
from
othnîel
to
samson
but
this
computation
can
not
be
relied
on
as
represents
an
indefinite
space
of
time
we
must
probably
limit
this
early
period
of
hebrew
history
to
about
a
century
and
a
half
from

the

probably
is
derived
from

the
differences
in
the
two
accounts
may
be
explained
as
having
arisen
partly
from
an
imperfect
understanding
of
the
poetic
text
and
partly
from
one
having
come
down
from
some
other
source
some
critics
suppose
that
the
prose
narrative
judges
iv
has
confounded
the
prophetess
deborah
wife
of
lapidoth
with
deborah
nurse
of
rachel

was
buried
near

under

judges
seems
to
be
from
two
different
sources
the
second
judges
viii
which
is
also
the
shortest
is
considered
by
some
to
represent
the
more
ancient
tradition
the
double
name
of
the
hero
has
led
some
to
assign
its
elements
respectively
to
gideon
judge
of
the
western
portion
of
manasseh
and
jerubbaal
judge
of
the
eastern
manasseh
and
to
the
consequent
fusion
of
the
two
men
in
one
this
is
an
assumption
which
follows
reasonably
from
judges
viii
the
site
of
the
ophrah
of
abiezer
is
not
known
for
certain
but
it
would
seem
from
the
narrative
that
it
was
in
the
neighbourhood
of
shechem
the
position
of
as
head
of
the
house
of
abiezer
follows
clearly
from
the
narrative
if
he
is
represented
in
the
first
part
of
the
account
as
a
man
of
humble
origin

it

respectively
in
which
seems
to
some
not
to
represent
the
canaanite
god
but
the
title
lord
as
applied
to
jahveh
was
supposed
to
mean
fights
against
him
and
was
therefore
offensive
to
the

jerubbaal
chose
from
among
them
three
hundred
of
the
strongest
with
whom
he
came
down
unexpectedly
upon
the
raiders
put
them
to
flight
in
the
plain
of
jezreel
and
followed
them
beyond
the
jordan
having
crossed
the
river
and
yet
pursuing
he
approached
the
men
of
succoth
and
asked
them
for
bread
for
himself
and
his
three
hundred
followers
their
fear
of
the
marauders
however
was
so
great
that
the
people
refused
to
give
him
any
help
and
he
had
no
better
success
with
the
people
of
penuel
whom
he
encountered
a
little
further
on
he
did
not
stop
to
compel
them
to
accede
to
his
wishes
but
swore
to
inflict
an
exemplary
punishment
upon
them
on
his
return
the
midianites
continued
their
retreat
in
the
mean
time
the
way
of
them
that
dwelt
in
tents
on
the
east
of
nobah
and
jogbehah
but
jerubbaal
came
up
with
them
near
karkâr
and
discomfited
the
host
he
took
vengeance
upon
the
two
peoples
who
had
refused
to
give
him
bread
and
having
thus
fulfilled
his
vow
he
began
to
question
his
prisoners
the
two
chiefs
manner
of
men
were
they
whom
ye
slew
at
tabor
thou
art
so
were
they
each
one
resembled
the
children
of

he
said
they
were
my
brethren
the
sons
of
my
mother
as
the
lord
liveth
if
ye
had
saved
them
alive
i
would
not
slay
you
and
he
said
unto
jether
his
firstborn
up
and
slay
them
but
the
youth
drew
not
his
sword
for
he
feared
because
he
was
yet
a
true
bedawins
as
they
were
the
pride
revolted
at
the
idea
of
their
being
handed
over
for
execution
to
a
child
and
they
cried
to
jerubbaal
thou
and
fall
upon
us
for
as
the
man
is
so
is
his
from
this
victory
rose
the
first
monarchy
among
the
israelites
the
midianites
owing
to
their
marauding
habits
and
the
amount
of
tribute
which
they
were
accustomed
to
secure
for
escorting
caravans
were
possessed
of
a
considerable
quantity
of
gold
which
they
lavished
on
the
decoration
of
their
persons
their
chiefs
were
clad
in
purple
mantles
their
warriors
were
loaded
with
necklaces
bracelets
rings
and
and
their
camels
also
were
not
behind
their
masters
in
the
brilliance
of
their
caparison
the
booty
which
gideon
secured
was
therefore
considerable
and
as
we
learn
from
the
narrative
excited
the
envy
of
the
ephraimites
who
said
hast
thou
served
us
thus
that
thou
calledst
us
not
when
thou
wentest
to
fight
with
midian
judges
viii
the
spoil
from
the
golden
alone
amounted
to
one
thousand
seven
hundred
shekels
as
we
learn
from
the
narrative
and
this
treasure
in
the
hands
of
jerubbaal
was
not
left
unemployed
but
was
made
doubtless
to
contribute
something
to
the
prestige
he
had
already
acquired
the
men
of
israel
whom
he
had
just
saved
from
their
foes
expressed
their
gratitude
by
offering
the
crown
to
him
and
his
successors
the
mode
of
life
of
the
hebrews
had
been
much
changed
after
they
had
taken
up
their
abode
in
the
mountains
of
canaan
the
tent
had
given
place
to
the
house
and
like
their
canaanite
neighbours
they
had
given
themselves
up
to
agricultural
pursuits
this
change
of
habits
in
bringing
about
a
greater
abundance
of
the
necessaries
of
life
than
they
had
been
accustomed
to
had
begotten
aspirations
which
threw
into
relief
the
inadequacy
of
the
social
organisation
and
of
the
form
of
government
with
which
they
had
previously
been
content
in
the
case
of
a
horde
of
nomads
defeat
or
exile
would
be
of
little
moment
should
they
be
obliged
by
a
turn
in
their
affairs
to
leave
their
usual
haunts
a
few
days
or
often
a
few
hours
would
suffice
to
enable
them
to
collect
their
effects
together
and
set
out
without
trouble
and
almost
without
regret
in
search
of
a
new
and
more
favoured
home
but
with
a
cultivator
of
the
ground
the
case
would
be
different
the
farm
clearings
and
homestead
upon
which
he
had
spent
such
arduous
and
continued
labour
the
olive
trees
and
vines
which
had
supplied
him
with
oil
and
wine
everything
in
fact
upon
which
he
depended
for
a
livelihood
or
which
was
dependent
upon
him
would
bind
him
to
the
soil
and
expose
his
property
to
disasters
likely
to
be
as
keenly
felt
as
wounds
inflicted
on
his
person
he
would
feel
the
need
therefore
of
laws
to
secure
to
him
in
time
of
peace
the
quiet
possession
of
his
wealth
of
an
army
to
protect
it
in
time
of
war
and
of
a
ruler
to
cause
on
the
one
hand
the
laws
to
be
respected
and
to
become
the
leader
on
the
other
of
the
military
forces
jerubbaal
is
said
to
have
in
the
first
instance
refused
the
crown
but
everything
goes
to
prove
that
he
afterwards
virtually
accepted
it
he
became
it
is
true
only
a
petty
king
whose
sovereignty
was
limited
to
manasseh
a
part
of
ephraim
and
a
few
towns
such
as
succoth
and
penuel
beyond
the
jordan
the
canaanite
city
of
shechem
also
paid
him
homage
like
all
great
chiefs
he
had
also
numerous
wives
and
he
recognised
as
the
national
deity
the
god
to
whom
he
owed
his
victories
out
of
the
spoil
taken
from
the
midianites
he
formed
and
set
up
at
ophrah
an
ephod
which
became
as
we
learn
snare
unto
him
and
unto
his

naturally
have

before

abimelech
to

unto
his
brethren
and
spake
with
them
and
with
all
the
family
of
the
house
of

saying
speak
i
pray
you
in
the
ears
of
all
the
men
of
shechem
whether
is
better
for
you
that
all
the
sons
of
jerubbaal
which
are
threescore
and
ten
persons
rule
over
you
or
that
one
rule
over
you
remember
also
that
i
am
your
bone
and
your
this
advice
was
well
received
it
flattered
the
vanity
of
the
people
to
think
that
the
new
king
was
to
be
one
of
themselves
hearts
inclined
to
follow
abimelech
for
they
said
he
is
our
brother
and
they
gave
him
threescore
and
ten
pieces
of
silver
out
of
the
house
of
the
lord
of
the
covenant
wherewith
abimelech
hired
vain
and
light
fellows
which
followed
him
he
slew
his
brethren
the
sons
of
jerubbaal
being
threescore
and
ten
persons
upon
one
the
massacre
having
been
effected
the
men
of
shechem
assembled
themselves
together
and
all
the
house
of

and
made
abimelech
king
by
the
oak
of
the
pillar
which
was
in
he
dwelt
at
ophrah
in
the
residence
and
near
the
sanctuary
of
his
father
and
from
thence
governed
the
territories
constituting
the
little
kingdom
of
manasseh
levying
tribute
upon
the
vassal
villages
and
exacting
probably
tolls

domain

jotham
the
youngest
son
of
gideon
escaped
the
massacre
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
the
election
of
abimelech
he
ascended
mount
gerizim
and
gave
out
from
there
the
fable
of
the
trees
applying
it
to
the
circumstances
of
the
time
and
then
fled
some
critics
think
that
this
fable
which
is
confessedly
old
was
inserted
in
the
text
at
a
time
when
prophetical
ideas
prevailed
and
monarchy
was
not
yet
accepted
this
condition
of
things
lasted
for
three
years
and
then
the
shechemites
who
had
shown
themselves
so
pleased
at
the
idea
of
having
of
their
as
sovereign
found
it
irksome
to
pay
the
taxes
levied
upon
them
by
him
as
if
they
were
in
no
way
related
to
him
the
presence
among
them
of
a
certain
zebul
the
officer
and
representative
of
abimelech
restrained
them
at
first
from
breaking
out
into
rebellion
but
they
returned
soon
to
their
ancient
predatory
ways
and
demanded
ransom
for
the
travellers
they
might
capture
even
when
the
latter
were
in
possession
of
the
safe
conduct
this
was
not
only
an
insult
to
their
lord
but
a
serious
blow
to
his
treasury
the
merchants
who
found
themselves
no
longer
protected
by
his
guarantee
employed
elsewhere
the
sums
which
would
have
come
into
his
hands
the
king
concealed
his
anger
however
he
was
not
inclined
to
adopt
premature
measures
for
the
place
was
a
strong
one
and
defeat
would
seriously
weaken
his
prestige
the
people
of
shechem
on
their
part
did
not
risk
an
open
rupture
for
fear
of
the
consequences
gaal
son
of
ebed
a
soldier
of
fortune
and
of
israelitish
blood
arrived
upon
the
scene
attended
by
his
followers
he
managed
to
gain
the
confidence
of
the
people
of
shechem
who
celebrated
under
his
protection
the
feast
of
the
vintage
the
name
ebed
is
assumed
to
have
been
substituted
in
the
massorotic
text
for
the
original
name
jobaal
because
of
the
element
baal
in
the
latter
word
which
was
regarded
as
that
of
the
strange
god
and
would
thus
have
the
sacrilegious
meaning
is
the
term
of
contempt
ebed
was
according
to
this
view
thus
used
to
replace
it
on
this
occasion
their
merrymaking
was
disturbed
by
the
presence
among
them
of
the
officer
charged
with
collecting
the
tithes
and
gaal
did
not
lose
the
opportunity
of
stimulating
their
ire

his
ironical
speeches

is

that
we
should
serve
him
is
not
he
the
son
of
jerubbaal
and

his
officer
serve
ye
the
men
of
hamor
the
father
of
shechem
but
why
should
we
serve
him
and
would
to
god
this
people
were
under
my
hand
then
would
i
remove
abimelech
and
he
said
to
abimelech
increase
thine
army
and
come
zebul
promptly
gave
information
of
this
to
his
master
and
invited
him
to
come
by
night
and
lie
in
ambush
in
the
vicinity
of
the
town
in
the
morning
as
soon
as
the
sun
is
up
thou
shalt
rise
early
and
set
upon
the
city
and
behold
when
he
and
the
people
that
is
with
him
come
out
against
thee
thou
mayest
do
to
them
as
thou
shalt
find
it
turned
out
as
he
foresaw
the
inhabitants
of
shechem
went
out
in
order
to
take
part
in
the
gathering
in
of
the
vintage
while
gaal
posted
his
men
at
the
entering
in
of
the
gate
of
the
city
as
he
looked
towards
the
hills
he
thought
he
saw
an
unusual
movement
among
the
trees
and
turning
round
said
to
zebul
who
was
close
by
there
come
people
down
from
the
tops
of
the
mountains
and
zebul
said
unto
him
thou
seest
the
shadow
of
the
mountains
as
if
they
were
a
moment
after
he
looked
in
another
direction
spake
again
and
said

there
come
people
down
by
the
middle
of
the
land
and
one
company
cometh
by
the
way
of
the
terebinth

seeing
the
affair
turn
out
so
well
threw
off
the
mask
and
replied
railingly

now

mouth
wherewith
thou
saidst
who
is
abimelech
that
we
should
serve
him

not
this
the

that
thou
hast
despised

of

city
he
withdrew
to
the
neighbouring
village
of
arumah
this
is
now
to
the
west
of

he
trusted
that
the
inhabitants
who
had
taken
no
part
in
the
affair
would
believe
that
his
wrath
had
been
appeased
by
the
defeat
of
gaal
and
so
in
fact
it
turned
out
they
dismissed
their
unfortunate
champion
and
on
the
morrow
returned
to
their
labours
as
if

had

two
views
as
to
the
nature
of
the
sacrifice
of

think
she
was
vowed
to
perpetual
virginity

consider
that

it
is
suggested
therefore
that
in

the

casluhim

should
be
transposed

bring

is
mention
of

of

some
have
made

inflicted
on

by

ii
the
cretans
are
by
some
thought
to
be
meant
which
would
account
for
their
association
with
the
philistines
gaza
enjoyed
among
them
a
kind
of
hegemony
alike
on
account
of
its
strategic
position
and
its
favourable
situation
for
commerce
but
this
supremacy
was
of
very
precarious
character
and
brought
with
it
no
right
whatever
to
meddle
in
the
internal
affairs
of
other
members
of
the
confederacy
each
of
the
latter
had
a
chief
of
its
own
a
seren
and
the
office
of
this
chief
was
hereditary
in
one
case
at

as

probably

five
sarnîm
assembled
in
council
to
deliberate
upon
common
interests
and
to
offer
sacrifices
in
the

of
the
pentapolis
these
chiefs
were
respectively
free
to
make
alliances
or
to
take
the
field
on
their
own
account
but
in
matters
of
common
importance
they
acted
together
and
took
their
places
each
at
the
head
of
his
own
contingent
their
armies
were
made
up
of
regiments
of
skilled
archers

were
added
a
body
of
charioteers

up
of

armour
for

alike
was
the

of

as
well
as
chariots
sam
i
the
horsemen
mentioned
in
the
same
connexion
are
regarded
by
some
critics
as
an
interpolation
because
they
can
not
bring
themselves
to
think
that
the
philistines
had
cavalry
corps
in
the
xth
century
the
philistine
arms
are
described
at
length
in
the
duel
between
david
and
goliath
sam
xvii
they
are
in
some
respects
like
those
of
the
homeric
heroes
their
war
tactics
were
probably
similar
to
those
of
the
egyptians
who
were
unrivalled
in
military
operations
at
this
period
throughout
the
whole
east
under
able
leadership
and
in
positions
favourable
for
the
operations
of
their
chariots
the
philistines
had
nothing
to
fear
from
the
forces
which
any
of
their
foes
could
bring
up
against
them
as
to
their
maritime
history
it
is
certain
that
in
the
earliest
period
at
least
of
their
sojourn
in
syria
as
well
as
in
that
before
their
capture
by
ramses
they
were
successful
in
but
the
memory
of
only
one
of
their
expeditions
has
come
down
to
us
a
squadron
of
theirs
having
sailed
forth
from
ascalon
somewhere
towards
the
end
of
the
xiith
dynasty
succeeded
in
destroying
the
sidonian
fleet
and
pillaging
sidon
itself
xviii
the
memory
of
this
has
been
preserved
owing
to
the
disputes
about
precedence
which
raged
in
the
greek
period
between
the
phoenician
towns
the
destruction
of
sidon
must
have
allowed

but
however
vigorously
they
may
have
plied
the
occupation
of
corsairs
at
the
outset
of
their
career
there
was
it
would
appear
a
rapid
falling
off
in
their
maritime
prowess
it
was
on
land
and
as
soldiers
that
they
displayed
their
bravery
and
gained
their
fame
their
geographical
position
indeed
on
the
direct
and
almost
only
route
for
caravans
passing
between
asia
and
africa
must
have
contributed
to
their
success
the
number
of
such
caravans
was
considerable
for
although
egypt
had
ceased
to
be
a
conquering
nation
on
account
of
her
feebleness
at
home
she
was
still
one
of
the
great
centres
of
production
and
the
most
important
market
of
the
east
a
very
great
part
of
her
trade
with
foreign
countries
was
carried
on
through
the
mouths
of
the
nile
and
of
this
commerce
the
phoenicians
had
made
themselves
masters
the
remainder
followed
the
and
passed
continually
through
the
territory
of
the
philistines
these
people
were
in
possession
of
the
tract
of
land
which
lay
between
the
mediterranean
and
the
beginning
of
the
southern
desert
forming
as
it
were
a
narrow
passage
into
which
all
the
roads
leading
from
the
nile
to
the
euphrates
necessarily
converged
the
chief
of
these
routes
was
that
which
crossed
mount
carmel
near
megiddo
and
passed
up
the
valleys
of
the
litâny
and
the
orontes
this
was
met
at
intervals
by
other
secondary
roads
such
as
that
which
came
from
damascus
by
way
of
tabor
and
the
plain
of
jezreel
or
those
which
starting
out
from
the
highland
of
gilead
led
through
the
fords
of
the
lower
jordan
to
ekron
and
gath
respectively
the
philistines
charged
themselves
after
the
example
and
at
the
instigation
of
the
egyptians
with
the
maintenance
of
the
great
trunk
road
which
was
in
their
hands
and
also
with
securing
safe
transit
along
it
as
far
as
they
could
post
their
troops
for
those
who
confided
themselves
to
their
care
in
exchange
for
these
good
offices
they
exacted
the
same
tolls
which
had
been
levied
by
the
canaanites
before
them
in
their
efforts
to
put
down
brigandage
they
had
been
brought
into
contact
with
some
of
the
hebrew
clans
after
the
latter
had
taken
possession
of
canaan
judah
in
its
home
among
the
mountains
of
the
dead
sea
had
become
acquainted
with
the
diverse
races
which
were
found
there
and
consequently
there
had
been
frequent
intermarriages
between
the
hebrews
and
these
peoples
some
critics
have
argued
from
this
that
the
chronicler
had
this
fact
in
his
mind
when
he
assigned
a
canaanite
wife
shuah
to
the
father
of
the
tribe
himself
he
relates
how
judah
having
separated
from
his
brethren
in
to
a
certain
adullamite
whose
name
was
hiram
and
that
here
he
became
acquainted
with
shuah
by
whom
he
had
three
sons
with
tamar
the
widow
of
the
eldest
of
the
latter
he
had
accidental
intercourse
and
two
children
perez
and
zerah
the
ancestors
of
numerous
families
were
born
of
that
union
gen
where
there
is
a
detailed
account
of
unions
edomites
arabs
and
midianites
were
associated
with
this
stock
for
example
kain
caleb
othniel
kenaz
shobal
ephah
and
jerahmeel
but
the
kenites
took
the
first
place
among
them
and
played
an
important
part
in
the
history
of
the
conquest
of
canaan
it
is
related
how
one
of
their
subdivisions
of
which
caleb
was
the
eponymous
hero
had
driven
from
hebron
the
three
sons
of
anak
sheshai
ahiman
and
talmai
and
had
then
promised
his
daughter
achsah
in
marriage
to
him
who
should
capture
debir
this
turned
out
to
be
his
youngest
brother
othniel
who
captured
the
city
and
at
the
same
time
obtained
a
wife
hobab
another
kenite
who
is
represented
to
have
been
the
of
moses
occupied
a
position
to
the
south
of
arad
in
idumsean
territory
these
heterogeneous
elements
existed
alongside
each
other
for
a
long
time
without
intermingling
they
combined
however
now
and
again
to
act
against
a
common
foe
for
we
know
that
the
people
of
judah
aided
the
tribe
of
simeon
in
the
reduction
of
the
city
of
zephath
but
they
followed
an
independent
course
for
the
most
part
and
their
isolation
prevented
their
obtaining
for
a
lengthened
period
any
extension
of
territory
the
of

called
jethro

where
zephath
is
the
better
reading
and
not
arad
as
has
been
suggested
they
failed
as
at
first
in
their
attempts
to
subjugate
the
province
of
arad
and
in
their
efforts
to
capture
the
fortresses
which
guarded
the
caravan
routes
between
ashdod
and
the
mouth
of
the
jordan
it
is
related
however
that
they
overthrew
king
of
the
jebusites
and
that
they
had
dealt
with
him
as
he
was
accustomed
to
deal
with
his
prisoners

independent
as
did
also
gibeon
beeroth
ajalon
gezer
and
the
cities
of
the
plain
for
the
israelites
could
not
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
the
valley
because
they
had
chariots
of
iron
with
which
the
hebrew
found
it
difficult
to
deal
this
independent
and
isolated
group
was
not
at
first
however
a
subject
of
anxiety
to
the
masters
of
the
coast
and
there
is
but
a
bare
reference
to
the
exploits
of
a
certain
shamgar
son
of
anath
who
of
the
philistines

to

with
ephraim
and
the
tribes
which
had
thrown
in

with
her
dan
had
cast
his
eyes
upon
the
northern
districts
of
the
shephelah
which
were
dependent
upon
ekron
or
gath
and
also
upon
the
port
of
joppa
but
these
tribes
did
not
succeed
in
taking
possession
of
those
districts
although
they
had
harassed
them
from
time
to
time
by
raids
in
which
the
children
of
israel
did
not
always
come
off
victorious
one
of
their
chiefs
samson
had
a
great
reputation
among
them
for
his
bravery
and
bodily
strength
but
the
details
of
his
real
prowess
had
been
forgotten
at
an
early
period
the
episodes
which
have
been
preserved
deal
with
some
of
his
exploits
against
the
philistines
and
there
is
a
certain
humour
in
the
account
of
the
weapons
which
he
employed
the
jawbone
of
an
ass

i
smitten
a
thousand
men
he
burned
up
their
harvest

by
letting
go
three
hundred
foxes
with
torches
attached
to
their
tails
among
the
standing
corn
of
the
philistines
various
events
in
his
career
are
subsequently
narrated
such
as
his
adventure
in
the
house
of
the
harlot
at
gaza
when
he
carried
off
the
gate
of
the
city
and
the
the
top
of
the
mountain

is
before
by
treachery
he
was
finally
delivered
over
to
his
enemies

having
put
out
his
eyes
condemned
him
to
grind
in
the
on
the
occasion
of
a
great
festival
in
honour
of
dagon
he
was
brought
into
the
temple
to
amuse
his
captors
but
while
they
were
making
merry
at
his
expense
he
took
hold
of
the
two
pillars
against
which
he
was
resting
and
bowing
with
all
his
might
overturned

the
house
fell
upon
the
lords
and
upon
all
the
people
that
were
some
learned
critics
considered
samson
to
have
been
a
sort
of
solar
deity
the
tribe
of
dan
at
length
became
weary
of
these
unprofitable
struggles
and
determined
to
seek
out
another
and
more
easily
defensible
settlement
they
sent
out
five
emissaries
therefore
to
look
out
for
a
new
home
while
these
were
passing
through
the
mountains
they
called
upon
a
certain
michah
in
the
of
ephraim
and
lodged
there
here
they
took
counsel
of
a
levite
whom
michah
had
made
his
priest
and
in
answer
to
the
question
whether
their
journey
would
be
prosperous
he
told
them
to
in
peace
before
the
lord

wherein
ye
their
search
turned

they
discovered
near

people
like
the
zidonians
dwelt
in
security
fearing
no

emissaries

bravery
it
had
shown
on
the
frontiers

showed
itself
the
most
bellicose
of

the
history
of
this
migration
which
is
given
summarily
in

as
it

stands
a
blending
of
two
accounts
the
presence
of
a

in
this
local
sanctuary
probably
offended
the
religious
scruples
of
a

the

never
failed
to
make
reprisals
after

the

were
no

for

armed
battalions

the
labyrinth
of
ravines

narrow
gorges
into
which
the
philistines
had
to
penetrate
to

was
a
favourable
region
for
guerilla
warfare
in

they
were
no

continued
to

it
had
been
under

the
people
of
ephraim
kept
there
the
ark
of
lord
of
it
was
a
chest
of
wood
similar
in
shape
to
the
shrine
which
surmounted
the
sacred
barks
of
the
egyptian
divinities
but
instead
of
a
prophesying
statue
it
contained
two
stones
on
which
according
to
the
belief
of
a
later
age
the
law
had
been
engraved
yearly
festivals
were
celebrated
before
it
and
it
was
consulted
as
an
oracle
by
all
the
israelites
eli
the
priest
to
whose
care
it
was
at
this
time
consigned
had
earned
universal
respect
by
the
austerity
of
his
life
and
by
his
skill
in
interpreting
the
divine
oracles
at
the
very
opening
of
the
book

shiloh
is
mentioned
as
being
the
sanctuary
of

the
lord

the
tradition
preserved
in
josh
xviii
removes
the
date
of
its
establishment
as
far
back
as
the
earliest
times
of
the
israelite
conquest
the
idea
that
the
tables
of
the
law
were
enclosed
in
the
ark
is
frequently
expressed
in
exodus
and
in
subsequent
books
of
the
hexateuch

history
of

over
chaps
of

incorporated
with
that
of

and
treats
only
of
the
events
which
accompanied
the
destruction
of
the
sanctuary
of
shiloh
by
the
philistines
his
two
sons
on
the
contrary
took
advantage
of
his
extreme
age
to
annoy
those
who
came
up
to
worship
and
they
were
even
accused
of
improper
behaviour
towards
the
women
who
at
the
door
the
tabernacle
they
appropriated
to
themselves
a
larger
portion
of
the
victims
than
they
were
entitled
to
extracting
from
the
caldron
the
meat
offerings
of
the
faithful
after
the
sacrifice
was
over
by
means
of
their
misdeeds
were
such
that
abhorred
the
offering
of
the
lord
and
yet
the
reverence
for
the
ark
was
so
great
in
the
minds
of
the
people
that
they
continued
to
have
recourse
to
it
on
every
occasion
of
national
danger
the
people
of
ephraim
and
benjamin
having
been
defeated
once
between
and
aphek
bore
the
ark
in
state
to
the
that
its
presence
might
inspire
them
with
confidence
the
philistines
were
alarmed
at
its
advent
and
exclaimed
is
come
into
the
camp
woe
unto
us
who
shall
deliver
us
out
of
the
hand
of
these
mighty
gods
be
strong
and
quit
yourselves
like
men
o
ye
philistines
that
ye
be
not
servants
unto
the
hebrews
as
they
have
been
to
in
response
to
this
appeal
their
troops
fought
so
boldly
that
they
once
more
gained
a
victory
there
ran
a
man
of
benjamin
out
of
the
army
and
came
to
shiloh
the
same
day
with
his
clothes
rent
and
with
earth
upon
his
head
and
when
he
came
lo
eli
sat
upon
his
seat
by
the
wayside
watching
for
his
heart
trembled
for
the
ark
of
god
and
when
the
man
came
into
the
city
and
told
it
all
the
city
cried
out
and
when
eli
heard
the
noise
of
the
crying
he
said
what
meaneth
the
noise
of
this
tumult
and
the
man
hasted
and
came
and
told
eli
now
eli
was
ninety
and
eight
years
old
and
his
eyes
were
set
that
he
could
not
see
and
the
man
said
unto
eli
i
am
he
that
came
out
of
the
army
and
i
fled
out
of
the
army
and
he
said
how
went
the
matter
my
son
and
he
that
brought
the
tidings
answered
and
said
israel
is
fled
before
the
philistines
and
there
hath
been
also
a
great
slaughter
among
the
people
and
thy
two
sons
also
hophni
and
phineas
are
dead
and
the
ark
of
god
is
taken
and
it
came
to
pass
when
he
made
mention
of
the
ark
of
god
that
he
fell
from
off
his
seat
backward
by
the
side
of
the
gate
and
his
neck
brake
and
he
died
for
he
was
an
old
man
and
sam
iv
this
is
not
mentioned
in
the
sacred
books
but
certain
reasons
for
believing
this
destruction
to
have
taken
place
are
given
by
stade
the
philistine
garrison
at
geba
gibeah
is
mentioned
in
sam
xiii
i
the
defeat
of
completed
at
least
for
a
time
the
overthrow
of
the
tribes
of
central
canaan
the
philistines
destroyed
the
sanctuary
of
shiloh
and
placed
a
garrison
at
gibeah
to
keep
the
benjamites
in
subjection
and
to
command
the
route
of
the
jordan
it
would
even
appear
that
they
pushed
their
beyond
carmel
in
order
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
independent
canaanite
cities
such
as
megiddo
taanach
and
bethshan
and
to
ensure
a
free
use
of
the
various
routes
leading
in
the
direction
of
damascus
tyre
and
after
the
victory
at
gilboa
the
philistines
exposed
the
dead
bodies
of
saul
and
his
sons
upon
the
walls
of
bethshan
sam
xxxi
which
they
would
not
have
been
able
to
do
had
the
inhabitants
not
been
allies
or
vassals
friendly
relations
with
bethshan
entailed
almost
as
a
matter
of
course
some
similar
understanding
with
the
cities
of
the
plain
of
jezreel
sam
vii
these
verses
represent
as
a
matter
of
fact
all
that
we
know
of
samuel
anterior
to
his
relations
with
saul
this
account
seems
to
represent
him
as
exercising
merely
a
restricted
influence
over
the
territory
of
benjamin
and
the
south
of
ephraim
it
was
not
until
the
prophetic
period
that
together
with
eli
he
was
made
to
figure
as
judge
of
all
israel
the
philistine
power
continued
dominant
for
at
least
half
a
century
the
hebrew
chroniclers
scandalised
at
the
prosperity
of
the
heathen
did
their
best
to
abridge
the
time
of
the
philistine
dominion
and
interspersed
it
with
israelitish
victories
just
at
this
time
however
there
lived
a
man
who
was
able
to
inspire
them
with
fresh
hope
he
was
a
priest
of
bamah
samuel
the
son
of
elkanah
who
had
acquired
the
reputation
of
being
a
just
and
wise
judge
in
the
towns
of
bethel
gilgal
and
mizpah
he
judged
israel
in
all
those
places
and
his
return
was
to
bamah
for
there
was
his
house
and
he
built
there
an
altar
unto
the
to
this
man
the
whole
israelite
nation
attributed
with
pride
the
deliverance
of
their
race
the
sacred
writings
relate
how
his
mother
the
pious
hannah
had
obtained
his
birth
from
jahveh
after
years
of
childlessness
and
had
forthwith
devoted
him
to
the
service
of
god
she
had
sent
him
to
shiloh
at
the
age
of
three
years
and
there
clothed
in
a
linen
tunic
and
in
a
little
robe
which
his
mother
made
for
him
herself
he
ministered
before
god
in
the
presence
of
eli
one
night
it
happened
when
the
latter
was
asleep
in
his
place
the
lamp
of
god
was
not
yet
gone
out
and
samuel
was
laid
down
to
sleep
in
the
temple
of
the
lord
where
the
ark
of
god
was
that
the
lord
called
samuel
and
he
said
here
am
i
and
he
ran
unto
eli
and
said
here
am
i
for
thou
calledst
me
and
he
said
i
called
thee
not
lie
down
twice
again
the
voice
was
heard
and
at
length
eli
perceived
that
it
was
god
who
had
called
the
child
and
he
bade
him
reply
lord
for
thy
servant
from
thenceforward
jahveh
was
him
and
did
let
none
of
his
words
fall
to
the
ground
and
all
israel
from
dan
even
to
beersheba
knew
that
samuel
was
established
to
be
a
prophet
of
the
twenty
years
after
the
sad
death
of
his
master
samuel
felt
that
the
moment
had
come
to
throw
off
the
philistine
yoke
he
exhorted
the
people
to
put
away
their
false
gods
and
he
assembled
them
at
mizpah
to
absolve
them
from
their
sins
the
philistines
suspicious
of
this
concourse
which
boded
ill
for
the
maintenance
of
their
authority
arose
against
him
when
the
children
of
israel
heard
it
they
were
afraid
of
the
philistines
and
samuel
took
a
sucking
lamb
and
offered
it
for
a
whole
burnt
offering
unto
the
lord
and
samuel
cried
unto
the
lord
for
israel
and
the
lord
answered
the
philistines
demoralised
by
the
thunderstorm
which
ensued
were
overcome
on
the
very
spot
where
they
had
triumphed
over
the
sons
of
eli
and
fled
in
disorder
to
their
own
country
samuel
took
a
stone
and
set
it
between
mizpah
and
shen
and
called
the
name
of
it
the
stone
of
help
saying
hitherto
hath
the
lord
helped
he
next
attacked
the
tyrians
and
the
amorites
and
won
back
from
them
all
the
territory
they
had
conquered
one
passage
in
which
samuel
is
not
mentioned
tells
us
how
heavily
the
philistine
yoke
had
weighed
upon
the
people
and
explains
their
long
patience
by
the
fact
that
their
enemies
had
taken
away
all
their
weapons
there
was
no
smith
found
throughout
all
the
land
of
israel
for
the
philistines
said
lest
the
hebrews
make
them
swords
or
spears
and
whoever
needed
to
buy
or
repair
the
most
ordinary
agricultural
implements
was
forced
to
address
himself
to
the
philistine
blacksmiths
the
very
extremity
of
the
evil
worked
its
own
cure
the
fear
of
the
had
already
been
the
occasion
of
the
ephemeral
rule
of
jerubbaal
and
abimelech
the
philistine
tyranny
forced
first
the
tribes
of
central
and
then
those
of
southern
canaan
to
unite
under
the
leadership
of
one
man
in
face
of
so
redoubtable
an
enemy
and
so
grave
a
peril
a
greater
effort
was
required
and
the
result
was
proportionate
to
their
increased
activity
this
manner
of
retaliating
against
the
philistines
for
the
disaster
they
had
formerly
inflicted
on
israel
is
supposed
by
some
critics
to
be
an
addition
of
a
later
date
either
belonging
to
the
time
of
the
prophets
or
to
the
period
when
the
jews
without
any
king
or
settled
government
rallied
at
mizpah
according
to
these
scholars
sam

forms
part
of
a
biography
written
at
a
time
when
the
foundation
of
the
benjamite
monarchy
had
not
as
yet
been
attributed
to
saul
sam

the

at

over

or
three
clans
but
that
of

embraced
the
israelite
nation

at
that
time
reckoned
among
its
most
powerful
chiefs
a
man
of
ancient
and
noble
family
saul
the
son
of
kish
who
possessed
extensive
flocks
and
considerable
property
and
was
noted
for
his
personal
beauty

not
among
the
children
of
israel
a
goodlier
person
than
he
from
his
shoulders
and
upward
he
was
higher
than
any
of
the
he
had
already
reached
mature
manhood
and
had
several
children
the
eldest
of
whom
jonathan
was
well
known
as
a
skilful
and
brave
soldier
while
reputation
was
such
that
his
kinsmen
beyond
jordan
had
recourse
to
his
aid
as
to
a
hero
whose
presence
would
secure
victory
the
ammonites
had
laid
siege
to
and
the
town
was
on
the
point
of
surrendering
saul
came
to
their
help
forced
the
enemy
to
raise
the
siege
and
inflicted
such
a
severe
lesson
upon
them
that
during
the
whole
of
his
lifetime
they
did
not
again
attempt
hostilities
he
was
soon
after
proclaimed
king
by
the
benjamites
as
jerubbaal
had
been
raised
to
authority
by
the
manassites
on
the
morrow
of
his
victory
the
beginning
of
reign
up
to
his
meeting
with
david
will
be
found
in
sam
we
can
distinguish
the
remains
of
at
least
two
ancient
narratives
which
the
writer
of
the
book
of
samuel
has
put
together
in
order
to
form
a
complete
and
continuous
account
as
elsewhere
in
this
work
i
have
confined
myself
to
accepting
the
results
at
which
criticism
has
arrived
without
entering
into
detailed
discussions
which
do
not
come
within
the
domain
of
history
sam

in
one
account
he
is
represented
as
quite
a
young
man
whose
father
is
still
in
the
prime
of
life
sam
ix
but
this
can
not
refer
to
the
time
of
the
philistine
war
where
we
find
him
accompanied
at
the
very
outset
of
his
reign
by
his
son
who
is
already
skilled
in
the
use
of
weapons
sam
xi
according
to
the
text
of
the
septuagint
the
war
against
the
ammonites
broke
out
a
month
after
saul
had
been
secretly
anointed
by
samuel
his
popular
proclamation
did
not
take
place
till
after
the
return
from
the
campaign
we
learn
from
the
sacred
writings
that
influence
had
helped
to
bring
about
these
events
it
had
been
shown
him
by
the
divine
voice
that
saul
was
to
be
the
chosen
ruler
and
he
had
anointed
him
and
set
him
before
the
people
as
their
appointed
lord
the
scene
of
this
must
have
been
either
mizpah
or
gilgal
one
narrative
appears
to
represent
him
as
being
only
the
priest
or
local
prophet
of
hamah
and
depicts
him
as
favourable
to
the
establishment
of
the
monarchy
sam

the
other
however
admits
that
he
was
of
all
israel

implies
that
he
was
hostile

the
choice
of
a
king
sam

the
accession
of
a
sovereign
who
possessed
the
allegiance
of
all

could
not
fail
to
arouse
the
vigilance
of
their
philistine
oppressors
jonathan
however
anticipated
their
attack

captured
gibeah
the
five

army

this
loss

they

how
far
his

extended

it
probably
stopped
short
at
the
neighbourhood
of
mount

and
the
galileans
either
refused
to
submit
to
his
authority
or
acknowledged
it
merely
in
theory
in
the

the
clans
of
judah
and

were
not
long
in
rallying
round
him
and
their
neighbours
the
kenites

appear
to
have
been
somewhat
in

to
the
benjamite

it

not

to
have

a

was
needed
to
attach

to

saul
endeavoured
to
get
rid
of
the
line
of
canaanite
cities
which
isolated
them
from
ephraim
but
he
failed
in
the
effort
we
know
not
from
what
cause
and
his
attempt
produced
no
other
result
than
to
arouse
against
him
the
hatred
of
the
gibeonite
inhabitants
he
did
his
best
to
watch
over
the
security
of
his
new
subjects
and
protected
them
against
the
amalekites
who
were
constantly
harassing
them
the
fact
is
made
known
to
us
by
an
accidental
mention
of
it
in
sam
xxi
the
motive
which
induced
saul
to
take
arms
against
the
gibeonites
is
immediately
apparent
when
we
realise
the
position
occupied
by
gideon
between
judah
and
the
tribes
of
central
canaan
their
king
agag
happening
to
fall
into
his
hands
he
killed
him
and
destroyed
several
of
their
nomad
bands
thus
inspiring
the
remainder
with
a
salutary
terror
subsequent
tradition
credited
him
with
victories
gained
over
all
the
enemies
of
israel
over
moab

and
even
the
aramaeans
of

it
endowed
him
even
with
the
projects
and
conquests
of
david
at
any
rate
the
constant
incursions
of
the
philistines
could
not
have
left
him
much
time
for
fighting
in
the
north
and
east
of
his
domains
their
defeat
at
gibeah
was
by
no
means
a
decisive
one
and
they
quickly
recovered
from
the
blow
the
conflict
with
them
lasted
to
the
end
of
lifetime
and
during
the
whole
of
this
period
he
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
increasing
his
army
the
monarchy
was
as
yet
in
a
very
rudimentary
state
without
either
the
pomp
or
accessories
usually
associated
with
royalty
in
the
ancient
kingdoms
of
the
east
saul
as
king
of
israel
led
much
the
same
sort
of
life
as
when
he
was
merely
a
benjamite
chief
he
preferred
to
reside
at
gibeah
in
the
house
of
his
forefathers
with
no
further
resources
than
those
yielded
by
the
domain
inherited
from
his

taken
by

thought
by
some
critics
to
have
been
introduced
with
a
view
of
exalting
the
office
at
the
expense
of
the
king
and
the
monarchy
they
regard
sam

as
being
the
sole
historic
ground
of
the
narrative
sam

we
may
admit
his
successful
skirmishes
with
moab
but
some
writers
maintain
that
the
defeat
of
the
edomites
and
aramaeans
is
a
mere
anticipation
and
consider
that
the
passage
is
only
a
reflection
of

of
the

we
know
that
the
spoil
was
divided
between
the

and

according
to
his
rank
and
in

to
the
valour

to

some

have
imagined
that
this

was
interpolated
at
a

date
and
reflects
the
events
which
are
narrated
in
chap
x
they
say
it
was
to
show
that
saul
was
not
alone
in
enjoying
consecration
by
the
prophet
and
hence
all
doubt
would
be
set
at
rest
as
to
whether
david
was
actually
that
of
thine
that
is
better
than
thou
mentioned
in
sam
xv
his
introduction
at
the
court
of
saul
is
variously
accounted
for
according
to
one
narrative
saul
being
possessed
by
an
evil
spirit
fell
at
times
into
a
profound
melancholy
from
which
he
could
be
aroused
only
by
the
playing
of
a
harp
on
learning
that
david
was
skilled
in
this
instrument
he
begged
jesse
to
send
him
his
son
and
the
lad
soon
won
the
affection
as
often
as
the
illness
came
upon
him
david
took
his
harp
and
was
refreshed
and
the
evil
spirit
departed
from
another
account
relates
that
he
entered
on
his
soldierly
career
by
killing
with
his
sling
goliath
of
gath
who
had
challenged
the
bravest
israelites
to
combat
though
elsewhere
the
death
of
goliath
is
attributed
to
elhanan
of
bethlehem
one
of
the
men
of
valour
who
specially
distinguished
himself
in
the
wars
against
the
philistines
david
had
however
no
need
to
take
to
himself
the
brave
deeds
of
others
at
in
company
with
eleazar
the
son
of
dodai
and
shammah
the
son
of
agu
he
had
posted
himself
in
a
field
of
lentils
and
the
three
warriors
had
kept
the
philistines
at
bay
till
their
discomfited
israelite
comrades
had
had
time
to
rally
sam

this
narrative
is
directly
connected
with
sam
xiv
where
we
are
told
that
when
saw
any
strong
man
or
any
valiant
man
he
took
him
unto
sam
xviii
according
to
some
writers
this
second
version
the
best
known
of
the
two
is
a
development
at
a
later
period
of
the
tradition
preserved
in
sam
xxi
where
the
victory
of
elhanan
over
goliath
is
recorded
sam
xxi
where
the
duel
of
goliath
and
elhanan
is
placed
in
the
reign
of
david
during
the
combat
at
gob
some
critics
think
that
the
writer
of
chronicles
recognising
the
difficulty
presented
by
this
passage
changed
the
epithet
bethlehemite
which
qualified
the
name
of
elhanan
into

name
of

to
get
over
the
difficulty

the
king
concealed
the
jealousy
which
this
simple
expression
of
joy
excited
within
him
but
it
found
vent
at
the
next
outbreak
of
his
illness
and
he
attempted
to
kill
david
with
a
spear
though
soon
after
he
endeavoured
to
make
amends
for
his
action
by
giving
him
his
second
daughter
michal
in
marriage
this
did
not
prevent
the
king
from
again
attempting
life
either
in
a
real
or
simulated
fit
of
madness
but
not
being
successful
he
despatched
a
body
of
men
to
waylay
him
according
to
one
account
it
was
michal
who
helped
her
husband
to
escape
while
another
attributes
the
saving
of
his
life
to
jonathan
this
prince
had
already
brought
about
one
reconciliation
between
his
father
and
david
and
had
spared
no
pains
to
reinstall
him
in
the
royal
favour
but
his
efforts
merely
aroused
the
suspicion
against
himself

that
a
conspiracy
existed
for

dethroning

of
replacing
him

that

no

that

according
to
some

two
contradictory
versions
have
been
blended
together

late
period
the
most
probable
version
is
given
in
sam

and
is
that
which

have
followed
by
preference
the
other
version
according
to
these
writers

too
important

relates
at
length
the
efforts
he
made
to
reconcile
his
father

friend

it
is
thought
from
the
confusion
apparent
in
this
part
of
the
narrative
that
a
record
of
the
real
motives
which
provoked
a
rupture
between
the

to
the
same

neither

favourable

was
a
perfect
labyrinth

descended
to

they
succeeded
in

no

they
learn

contemplated
pushing
further
afield
and
rallying
round
him
those
northern
tribes
who
had
hitherto
never
acknowledged
his
authority
he
may
on
the
other
hand
have
desired
merely
to
lay
hands
on
the

divert

the
hebrews

formed
the
personal
guard

the
four
other

objected
to

strangers
in

and
forced

to
dismiss
them
david
returned
to
ziklag
to
find
ruin
and
desolation
everywhere

amalekites
had
taken
advantage
of
the
departure

hebrews
to
revenge
themselves

for
all
for
former
raids
on

they

all
the
booty
they
had
collected
by
the
way
in
the
southern
provinces
of
caleb
in
judah
and
in
the
cherethite
plain
he
distributed
part
of
this
spoil

shown
hospitality
to
himself

his
men
for

effort

where
the
courage
of
his
troops
made
up
for
their
lack
of
numbers
and
the
inferiority
of
their

he
was
imprudent
enough
to
take
up
a
position
on
the
hillsides
of
gilboa
whose
gentle
slopes
offered
no
hindrances
to
the

episode

accounts

the
battle
was
fought
between

that
the
final
scene
took
place
on
the
slopes
of

there
are
even
two
versions
of
the
battle

in

in

does
not

the
tragic
end
of
their
king
made
a
profound
impression
on
the
people
we
read
that
before
entering
on
his
last
battle
saul
was
given
over
to
gloomy
forebodings
he
had
sought
counsel
of
jahveh
but
god
him
not
neither
by
dreams
nor
by
urim
nor
by
the
aged
samuel
had
passed
away
at
ramah
and
had
apparently
never
seen
the
king
after
the
flight
of
david
saul
now
bethought
himself
of
the
prophet
in
his
despair
and
sought
to
recall
him
from
the
tomb
to
obtain
his
counsel

a
mention
of
the
measures
taken
by
saul
against
the
wizards
and
the
king
had
banished
from
the
land
all
wizards
and
but
his
servants
brought
him
word
that
at
endor
there
still
remained
a
woman
who
could
call
up
the
dead
saul
disguised
himself
and
accompanied
by
two
of
his
retainers
went
to
find
her
he
succeeded
in
overcoming
her
fear
of
punishment
and
persuaded
her
to
make
the
evocation

thee

when
the
woman
saw
samuel
she
cried
with
a
loud
voice
saying
hast
thou
deceived
me
for
thou
art

said
unto
her
not

for

recognised
samuel
and
prostrated
himself
with
his
face

the
ground

prophet
as
inflexible
after
death
as
in
his
lifetime
had
no
words
of
comfort
for
the
man
who
had
troubled

repose
lord

rent
the
kingdom
out
of
thine
hand
and
given
it
to
thy

thou

xxviii
there
is
no
reason
why
this
scene
should
not
be
historical
it
was
natural
that
saul
like
many
an
ancient
general
in
similar
circumstances
should
seek
to
know
the
future
by
means
of
the
occult
sciences
then
in
vogue
some
critics
think
that
certain
details
of
the
evocation
as
for
instance
the
words
attributed
to
samuel
are
of
a
later
date
we
learn
also
how
david
at
ziklag
on
hearing
the
news
of
the
disaster
had
broken
into
weeping
and
had
composed
a
lament
full
of
beauty
known
as
the
of
the
bow
which
the
people
of
judah
committed
to
memory
in
their
childhood

this
elegy
is
described
as
a
quotation
from
jasher
the
of
the
many
modern
writers
attribute
its
authorship
to
david
himself
others
reject
this
view
all
agree
in
regarding
it
as
extremely
ancient
the
title
of
the
bow
is
based
on
the
possibly
corrupt
text
of
ver
the
philistines
occupied
in
force
the
plain
of
jezreel
and
the
pass
which
leads
from
it
into
the
lowlands
of
bethshan
the
israelites
abandoned
the
villages
which
they
had
occupied
in
these
districts
and
the
gap
between
the
hebrews
of
the
north
and
those
of
the
centre
grew
wider
the
remnants
of
army
sought
shelter
on
the
eastern
bank
of
the
jordan
but
found
no
leader
to
reorganise
them
the
reverse
sustained
by
the
israelitish
champion
seemed
moreover
to
prove
the
futility
of
trying
to
make
a
stand
against
the
invader
and
even
the
of
the
monarchy
itself
why
they
might
have
asked
burthen
ourselves
with
a
master
and
patiently
bear
with
his
exactions
if
when
put
to
the
test
he
fails
to
discharge
the
duties
for
the
performance
of
which
he
was
chosen
and
yet
the
advantages
of
a
stable
form
of
government
had
been
so
manifest
during
the
reign
of
saul
that
it
never
for
a
moment
occurred
to
his
former
subjects
to
revert
to
patriarchal
institutions
the
question
which
troubled
them
was
not
whether
they
were
to
have
a
king
but
rather
who
was
to
fill
the
post
saul
had
left
a
considerable
number
of
descendants
behind
him
from
these

the
ablest
of
his
captains
chose
ishbaal
and
set
him
on

judah
held
aloof

adopted
the

policy
at
the
beginning
of

previous
reign
yet
its
earlier
isolation
had
not
prevented
it
from
afterwards
throwing
in
its
lot
with
the
rest
of
the
nation

at
that
time
no
leader
had
come
forward
from

own
ranks
who
was
worthy
to
be
reckoned
among

of

on

contrary

had
on

frontier

bold

no

in
stepping
into
the
place
of
those
whose
loss
he
had
bewailed

sudden
removal

it
left
him
without
a
peer
among
his
own
people
exposed
him
to
the
suspicion
and
underground
machinations
of
his
foreign
protectors
he
therefore
quitted
them
and
withdrew
to
hebron
where
his
hastened
to
proclaim
him
king
from
that
time
onwards
the
tendency
of
the
hebrew
race
was
to
drift
apart
into
two
distinct
bodies
one
of
them
the
house
of
joseph
which
called
itself
by
the
name
of
israel
took
up
its
position
in
the
north
on
the
banks
of
the
jordan
the
other
which
is
described
as
the
house
of
judah
in
the
south
between
the
dead
sea
and
the
shephelah
abner
endeavoured
to
suppress
the
rival
kingdom
in
its
infancy
he
brought
ishbaal
to
gibeah
and
proposed
to
joab
who
was
in
command
of
army
that
the
conflict
should
be
decided
by
the
somewhat
novel
expedient
of
pitting
twelve
of
the
house
of
judah
against
an
equal
number
of
the
house
of
benjamin
the
champions
of
judah
are
said
to
have
won
the
day
but
the
opposing
forces
did
not
abide
by
the
result
and
the
struggle
still
continued
sam
ii
very
probably
abner
recognised
the
philistine
suzerainty
as
david
had
done
for
the
sake
of
peace
at
any
rate
we
find
no
mention
in
holy
writ
of
a
war
between
ishbaal
and
the
philistines
sam
ii
iii
an
intrigue
in
the
harem
furnished
a
solution
of
the
difficulty
saul
had
raised
one
of
his
wives
of
the
second
rank
named
eizpah
to
the
post
of
favourite
abner
became
enamoured
of
her
and
took
her
this
was
an
insult
to
the
royal
house
and
amounted
to
an
act
of
open
usurpation
the
wives
of
a
sovereign
could
not
legally
belong
to
any
but
his
successor
and
for
any
one
to
treat
them
as
abner
had
treated
rizpah
was
equivalent
to
his
declaring
himself
the
equal
and
in
a
sense
the
rival
of
his
master
ishbaal
keenly
resented
his
conduct
and
openly
insulted
him
abner
made
terms
with
david
won
the
northern
tribes
including
that
of
benjamin
over
to
his
side
and
when
what
seemed
a
propitious
moment
had
arrived
made
his
way
to
hebron
with
an
escort
of
twenty
men
he
was
favourably
received
and
all
kinds
of
promises
were
made
him
but
when
he
was
about
to
depart
again
in
order
to
complete
the
negotiations
with
the
disaffected
elders
joab
returning
from
an
expedition
led
him
aside
into
a
gateway
and
slew
him
david
gave
him
solemn
burial
and
composed
a
lament
on
the
occasion
of
which
four
verses
have
come
down
to
us
having
thus
paid
tribute
to
the
virtues
of
the
deceased
general
he
lost
no
time
in
taking
further
precautions
to
secure
his
power
the
unfortunate
king
ishbaal
deserted
by
every
one
was
assassinated
by
two
of
his
officers
as
he
slept
in
the
heat
of
the
day
and
his
head
was
carried
to
hebron
david
again
poured
forth
lamentations
and
ordered
the
traitors
to
be
killed
there
was
now
no
obstacle
between
him
and
the
throne
the
elders
of
the
people
met
him
at
hebron
poured
oil
upon
his
head
and
anointed
him
king
over
all
the
provinces
which
had
obeyed
the
rule
of
saul
in
gilead
ephraim
and
benjamin
as
well
as
judah
sam
in
ghron
xi
xii
we
find
further
details
beyond
those
given
in
the
book
of
samuel
it
seems
probable
however
that
the
northern
tribes
may
not
have
recognised
sovereignty
at
this
time
as
long
as
ishbaal
lived
and
his
dissensions
with
judah
assured
their
supremacy
the
philistines
were
content
to
suspend
hostilities
the
news
of
his
death
and
of
the
union
effected
between
israel
and
judah
soon
roused
them
from
this
state
of
quiescence
as
prince
of
the
house
of
caleb
and
vassal
of
the
lord
of
grath
david
had
not
been
an
object
of
any
serious
apprehension
to
them
but
in
his
new
character
as
master
of
the
dominions
of
saul
david
became
at
once
a
dangerous
rival
whom
they
must
overthrow
without
delay
unless
they
were
willing
to
risk
being
ere
long
overthrown
by
him
they
therefore
made
an
attack
on
bethlehem
with
the
choicest
of
their
forces
and
entrenched
themselves
there
with
the
canaanite
city
of
jebus
as
their
base
so
as
to
separate
judah
entirely
from
benjamin
and
cut
off
the
little
army
quartered
round
hebron
from
the
reinforcements
which
the
central
tribes
would
otherwise
have
sent
to
its
aid
this
move
was
carried
out
so
quickly
that
david
found
himself
practically
isolated
from
the
rest
of
his
kingdom
and
had
no
course
left
open
but
to
shut
himself
up
in
adullam
with
his
ordinary
guard
and
the
judsean
levies
the
history
of
this
war
is
given
in
sam
where
the
text
shows
signs
of
having
been
much
condensed
it
is
preceded
by
the
account
of
the
capture
of
jerusalem
which
some
critics
would
like
to
transfer
to
chap
following
ver
which
leads
up
to
it
the
events
which
followed
are
if
we
assume
as
i
have
done
in
the
text
that
the
philistines
wished
to
detach
judah
from
israel
at
first
sam
david
endeavours
to
release
himself
and
effect
a
juncture
with
israel
as
is
proved
by
the
relative
positions
assigned
to
the
two
opposing
armies
the
philistines
at
bethlehem
david
in
the
cave
of
adullam
afterwards
sam
david
has
shaken
himself
free
has
rejoined
israel
and
is
carrying
on
the
struggle
between
gibeah
and
gezer
the
incidents
recounted
in
sam
xxi
xxiii
seem
to
refer
almost
exclusively
to
the
earlier
part
of
the
war
at
the
time
when
the
hebrews
were
hemmed
in
in
the
neighbourhood
of
adullam
the
passage
in
sam
simply
states
that
david
down
to
the
hold
and
gives
no
further
details
this
expression
following
as
it
does
the
account
of
the
taking
of
jerusalem
would
seem
to
refer
to
this
town
itself
and
renan
has
thus
interpreted
it
it
really
refers
to
adullam
as
is
shown
by
the
passage
in
sam
xxiii
sam
xxi
the
whole
district
round
about
is
intersected
by
a
network
of
winding
streams
and
abounds
in
rocky
gorges
where
a
few
determined
men
could
successfully
hold
their
ground
against
the
onset
of
a
much
more
numerous
body
of
troops
the
caves
afford
as
we
know
almost
impregnable
refuges
david
had
often
hidden
himself
in
them
in
the
days
when
he
fled
before
saul
and
now
his
soldiers
profited
by
the
knowledge
he
possessed
of
them
to
elude
the
attacks
of
the
philistines
he
began
a
sort
of
guerilla
warfare
in
the
conduct
of
which
he
seems
to
have
been
without
a
rival
and
harassed
in
endless
skirmishes
his
more
heavily
equipped
adversaries
he
did
not
spare
himself
and
freely
risked
his
own
life
but
he
was
of
small
stature
and
not
very
powerful
so
that
his
spirit
often
outran
his
strength
on
one
occasion
when
he
had
advanced
too
far
into
the
fray
and
was
weary
with
striking
he
ran
great
peril
of
being
killed
by
a
gigantic
philistine
with
difficulty
abishai
succeeded
in
rescuing
him
unharmed
from
the
dangerous
position
into
which
he
had
ventured
and
for
the
future
he
was
not
allowed
to
run
such
risks
on
the
field
of
battle
on
another
occasion
when
lying
in
the
cave
of
adullam
he
began
to
feel
a
longing
for
the
cool
waters
of
bethlehem
and
asked
who
would
go
down
and
fetch
him
a
draught
from
the
well
by
the
gates
of
the
town
three
of
his
mighty
men
joshebbasshebeth
eleazar
and
shammah
broke
through
the
host
of
the
philistines
and
succeeded
in
bringing
it
but
he
refused
to
drink
the
few
drops
they
had
brought
and
poured
them
out
as
a
libation
to
jehovah
saying
i
drink
the
blood
of
men
that
went
in
jeopardy
of
their
lives
duels
between
the
bravest
and
stoutest
champions
of
the
two
hosts
were
of
frequent
occurrence
it
was
in
an
encounter
of
this
kind
that
elhanan
the
bethlehemite
or
david
slew
the
giant
goliath
at
gob
at
length
david
succeeded
in
breaking
his
way
through
the
lines
in
the
valley
of
kephaîm
thus
forcing
open
the
road
to
the
north
here
he
probably
fell
in
with
the
israelitish
contingent
and
thus
reinforced
was
at
last
in
a
position
to
give
battle
in
the
open
he
was
again
successful
and
routing
his
foes
pursued
them
from
gibeon
to
gezer
none
of
his
victories
however
was
of
a
sufficiently
decisive
character
to
bring
the
struggle
to
an
end
it
dragged
on
year
after
year
and
when
at
last
it
did
terminate
there
was
no
question
on
either
side
of
submission
or
of
tribute
the
hebrews
completely
regained
their
independence
but
the
philistines
do
not
seem
to
have
lost
any
portion
of
their
domain
and
apparently
retained
possession
of
all
that
they
had
previously
held
sam
xxiii
cf
ghron
xi
popular
tradition
furnishes
many
incidents
of
a
similar
type
cf
alexander
in
the
desert
of
gedrosia
godfrey
de
bouillon
in
asia
minor
etc
the
hebrew
text
gives
geba
or
gibeah
to
sam
the
septuagint
gibeon
to
this
latter
reading
which
is
that
of
chron
xiv
tr
is
more
in
accordance
with
the
geographical
facts
and
i
have
therefore
adopted
it
jahveh
had
shown
by
a
continual
rustling
in
the
leaves
of
the
mulberry
trees
that
he
was
on
side
in
sam
viii
we
are
told
that
david
humiliated
the
philistines
and
took
bridle
of
the
mother
out
of
their
hands
or
in
other
words
destroyed
the
supremacy
which
they
had
exercised
over
israel
he
probably
did
no
more
than
this
and
failed
to
secure
any
part
of
their
territory
the
passage
in
chron
xviii
which
attributes
to
him
the
conquest
of
gath
and
its
dependencies
is
probably
an
amplification
of
the
somewhat
obscure
wording
employed
in
sam
viii
but
though
they
suffered
no
loss
of
territory
their
position
was
in
reality
much
inferior
to
what
it
was
before
their
control
of
the
plain
of
jezreel
was
lost
to
them
for
ever
and
with
it
the
revenue
which
they
had
levied
from
passing
caravans
the
hebrews
transferred
to
themselves
this
right
of
their
former
masters
and
were
so
much
the
richer
at
their
expense
to
the
five
cities
this
was
a
more
damaging
blow
than
twenty
reverses
would
have
been
to
benjamin
or
judah
the
military
spirit
had
not
died
out
among
the
philistines
and
they
were
still
capable
of
any
action
which
did
not
require
sustained
effort
but
lack
of
resources
prevented
them
from
entering
on
a
campaign
of
any
length
and
any
chance
they
may
at
one
time
have
had
of
exercising
a
dominant
influence
in
the
affairs
of
southern
syria
had
passed
away
under
the
restraining
hand
of
egypt
they
returned
to
the
rank
of
a
power
just
strong
enough
to
inspire
its
neighbours
with
respect
but
too
weak
to
extend
its
territory
by
annexing
that
of
others
though
they
might
still
at
times
give
david
trouble
by
contesting
at
intervals
the
possession
of
some
outlying
citadel
or
by
making
an
occasional
raid
on
one
of
the
districts
which
lay
close
to
the
frontier
they
were
no
longer
a
permanent
menace
to
the
continued
existence
of
his
kingdom
but
was
judah
strong
enough
to
take
their
place
and
set
up
in
southern
syria
a
sovereign
state
around
which
the
whole
fighting
material
of
the
country
might
range
itself
with
confidence
the
incidents
of
the
last
war
had
clearly
shown
the
disadvantages
of
its
isolated
position
in
regard
to
the
bulk
of
the
nation
the
gap
between
ekron
and
the
jordan
which
separated
it
from
ephraim
and
manasseh
had
at
all
costs
to
be
filled
up
if
a
repetition
of
the
manouvre
which
so
nearly
cost
david
his
throne
at
adullam
were
to
be
avoided
it
is
true
that
the
gibeonites
and
their
allies
acknowledged
the
sovereignty
of
ephraim
and
formed
a
sort
of
connecting
link
between
the
tribes
but
it
was
impossible
to
rely
on
their
fidelity
so
long
as
they
were
exposed
to
the
attacks
of
the
jebusites
in
their
rear
as
soon
therefore
as
david
found
he
had
nothing
more
to
fear
from
the
philistines
he
turned
his
attention
to
jerusalem
this
city
stood
on
a
dry
and
sterile
limestone
spur
separated
on
three
sides
from
the
surrounding
hills
by
two
valleys
of
unequal
length
that
of
the
kedron
on
the
east
begins
as
a
simple
depression
but
gradually
becomes
deeper
and
narrower
as
it
extends
towards
the
south
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
its
commencement
it
is
nothing
more
than
a
deep
gorge
shut
in
by
precipitous
rocks
which
for
some
days
after
the
winter
rains
is
turned
into
the
bed
of
a
torrent
the
name
jerusalem

under
the
form

tel

was
the
name
of
the
citadel
preserved
by
the
israelites
after
the
capture
of
the
place
and
applied
by
them
to
the
part
of
the
city

contained
the

excavations
show
that
the

diminishes
at
the
foot
of
the
ancient
walls
and
that
the
bottom
of
the
valley
has
risen
nearly
twelve
yards
during

a

than
an

plain

by

ancient
times
it
was
traversed
by
a
depression

with

undoubtedly
more
ancient
the

or
its
true
position
which
had
been
only
suspected
up
to
the
middle
of
the
present
century
was
determined
with
certainty
by
means
of
the
excavations
carried
out
by
the
english
and
germans
the
bottom
of
the
valley
was
found
at
a
depth
of
from
forty
to
sixty
feet
below
the
present
surface
an
unfortified
suburb

gradually
grown
up
on
the
lower
ground
to
the
west
and
was
connected
by
a
stairway
cut
in
the
with
the
upper
city
this
latter
was
surrounded
by
ramparts
with
turrets
like
those
of
the
canaanitish
citadels

we
constantly
find

on
the

monuments
its
natural
advantages
and
efficient
garrison
had
so
far
enabled
it
to
repel
all
the
attacks
of
its
enemies
this
is
the
ophel
of
the
hebrew
text
when
david
appeared
with
his
troops
the
inhabitants
ridiculed
his
presumption
and
were
good
enough
to
warn
him
of
the
hopelessness
of
his
enterprise

garrison
composed
of
the
halt
and
the
blind
without
an
man
amongst
them

declared
be
able
successfully
to
resist

the
king
stung
by
their
mockery
made
a
promise
to
his
that
the
first
of
them
to
scale
the
walls
should

we
often
find
that
impregnable
cities
owe
their
downfall
to
negligence
on
the
part
of
their
defenders
these
concentrate
their
whole
attention
on
the
few
vulnerable
points
and
give
but
scanty
care
to
those
which
are
regarded
as
inaccessible
jerusalem
proved
to
be
no
exception
to
this
rule
joab
carried
it
by
a
sudden
assault
and
received
as
his
reward
the
best
part
of
the
territory
which
he
had
won
by
his
valour
cf
the
capture
of
sardis
by
cyrus
herodotus
and
by
antiochus
iii
polybius
as
also
the
taking
of
the
capitol
by
the
gauls
the
account
of
the
capture
of
jerusalem
is
given
in
sam
where
the
text
is
possibly
corrupt
with
interpolated
glosses
especially
in

reply
to
the
mockery
of
the
jebusites

difficult
to

citron
xi
gives
a
more
correct
text
but
one
less
complete
in
so
far
as
the
portions
parallel
with
sam
are
concerned
the
details
in
regard
to
joab
are
undoubtedly
historical
but
we
do
not
find
them
in
the
book
of
samuel
in
attacking
jerusalem
first
idea
was
probably
to
rid
himself
of
one
of
the
more
troublesome
obstacles
which
served
to
separate
of
his
people
from
the
other
but
once
he
had
set
foot
in
the
place
he
was
not
slow
to
perceive
its
advantages
and
determined
to
make
it
his
residence
hebron
had
sufficed
so
long
as
his
power
extended
over
caleb
and
judah
only
situated
as
it
was
in
the
heart
of
the
mountains
and
in
the
wealthiest
part
of
the
province
in
which
it
stood
it
seemed
the
natural
centre
to
which
the
kenites
and
men
of
judah
must
gravitate
and
the
point
at
which
they
might
most
readily
be
moulded
into
a
nation
it
was
however
too
far
to
the
south
to
offer
a
convenient
for
a
ruler
who
wished
to
bring
the
hebrew
communities
scattered
about
on
both
banks
of
the
jordan
under
the
sway
of
a
common
sceptre
jerusalem
on
the
other
hand
was
close
to
the
crossing
point
of
the
roads
which
lead
from
the
sinaitic
desert
into
syria
and
from
the
shephelah
to
the
land
of
gilead
it
commanded
nearly
the
whole
domain
of
israel
and
the
ring
of
hostile
races
by
which
it
was
encircled
from
this
lofty
eyrie
david
with
judah
behind
him
could
either
swoop
down
upon
moab
whose
mountains
shut
him
out
from
a
view
of
the
dead
sea
or
make
a
sudden
descent
on
the
seaboard
by
way
of
bethhoron
at
the
least
sign
of
disturbance
among
the
philistines
or
could
push
straight
on
across
mount
ephraim
into
galilee
issachar
naphtali
asher
dan
and
zebulun
were
perhaps
a
little
too
far
from
the
seat
of
government
but
they
were
secondary
tribes
incapable
of
any
independent
action
who
obeyed
without
repugnance
but
also
without
enthusiasm
the
able
to
protect
them
from
external
foes
the
future
master
of
israel
would
be
he
who
maintained
his
hold
on
the
posterity
of
judah
and
of
joseph
and
david
could
not
hope
to
find
a
more
suitable
place
than
jerusalem
from
which
to
watch
over
the
two
ruling
houses
at
one
and
the

time
the
lower
part
of
the
town
he
gave
up
to
the
original

filled
with

of
ahijah
the
prophet
of
shiloh
david
was
no
longer
satisfied
with
the
ephod
which
had
been
the
channel
of
many
wise
counsels
during
his
years
of
adversity
and
his
struggles
against
the
philistines
he
longed
for
some
still
more
sacred
object
with
which
to
identify
the
fortunes
of
his
people
and
by
which
he
might
raise
the
newly
gained
prestige
of
his

it
so
happened
that
the

taken
from

the
reason
why
it

on

was
that
anger
had
been

at
the
misdeeds
committed
in

desired
to
punish

it

according

their
custom
shut
it
up
in
the
temple
of
dagon
at

on
the

when
the

entered

they
found
the

prostrate
in

his

scattered
on

a
plague
of
malignant

broke
out
among

thousands
of

overran
their

the

it
thus
went

in

accompanied

disasters

obtained

it
would
seem
to
be
an
of
the
same
kind
as
that
referred
to
in
the
hebrew
text
but
it
is
of
doubtful
authenticity
the
ark
was
placed
on
a
new
cart
and
two
milch
cows
with
their

drew
it
lowing
all
the
way
without
guidance
from
any

to
the
field
of
a
certain

the

joy

their
curiosity
overcame
their
reverence
and
they
looked

being
angered
thereat
smote
seventy
men

insecurity

seemed
to
punish

not
remove
the
to

but
left
it
for
three
months
in
the
house
of
a
philistine
of
gath
but
finding
that
its
host
instead
of
experiencing
any
evil
was
blessed
by
the
lord
he
carried
out
his
original
intention
and
brought
the
ark
to
jerusalem
girded
with
a
linen
ephod
danced
with
all
his
might
before
the
lord
and
the
house
of
israel
brought
up
the
ark
of
the
lord
with
shouting
and
with
the
sound
of
the
when
the
ark
had
been
placed
in
the
tent
that
david
had
prepared
for
it
he
offered
up
burnt
offerings
and

offerings
and
at
the
end
of
the
festival
there
were
dealt
out
to
the
people
gifts
of
bread
cakes
and
wine
or
flesh
there
is
inserted
in
the
an
account
of
the
conduct
of
michal
his
wife
who
looking
out
of
the
window
and
seeing
the
king
dancing
and
playing
despised
him
in
her
heart
and
when
david
returned
to
his
house
congratulated
him
ironically
glorious
was
the
king
of
israel
who
uncovered
himself
in
the
eyes
of
the
handmaids
of
his
servants
renan
would
consider
this
to
have
been
inserted
in
the
time
of
hezekiah
it
appeared
to
him
to
answer
the
antipathy
of
hamutal
and
the
ladies
of
the
court
to
the
worship
of
jahveh
and
to
that
form
of
human
respect
which
restrained
the
people
of
the
world
from
giving
themselves
up
to
david
said
in
reply
that
he
would
rather
be
held
in
honour
by
the
handmaids
of
whom
she
had
spoken
than
avoid
the
acts
which
covered
him
with
ridicule
in
her
eyes
and
the
chronicler
adds
that
the
daughter
of
saul
had
no
child
unto
the
day
of
her
reply
shows
sam
vi
that
it
was
in
gratitude
to
jehovah
who
had
exalted
him
that
he
thus
humbled
tr
the
tent
and
the
ark
were
assigned
at
this
time
to
the
care
of
two
priests
zadok
son
of
ahitub
and
abiathar
son
of
ahimelech
who
was
a
descendant
of
eli
and
had
never
quitted
david
throughout
his
adventurous
career
it
is
probable
too
that
the
ephod
had
not
disappeared
and
that
it
had
its
place
in
the
sanctuary
but
it
may
have
gradually
fallen
into
neglect
and
may
have
ceased
to
be
the
vehicle
of
oracular
responses
as
in
earlier
years
the
king
was
accustomed
on
important
occasions
to
take
part
in
the
sacred
ceremonies
after
the
example
of
contemporary
monarchs
and
he
had
beside
him
at
this
time
a
priest
of
standing
to
guide
him
in
the
religious
rites
and
to
fulfil
for
him
duties
similar
to
those
which
the
chief
reader
rendered
to
pharaoh
the
only
one
of
these
priests
of
david
whose
name
has
come
down
to
us
was
ira
the
jethrite
who
accompanied
his
master
in
his
campaigns
and
would
seem
to
have
been
a
soldier
also
and
one
of
these
priestly
officials
seem
however
to
have
played
but
a
subordinate
part
as
history
is
almost
silent
about
their
acts
while
david
owed
everything
to
the
sword
and
trusted
in
it
he
recognised
at
the
same
time
that
he
had
obtained
his
crown
from
jahveh
just
as
the
sovereigns
of
thebes
and
nineveh

he
consulted
the

directly

wished
for
counsel
and
accepted
the
issue
as
a
test
whether
his
interpretation
of
the
divine
will
was
correct
or
erroneous
when
once
he
had
realised
at
the
time
of
the
capture
of
jerusalem
that
god
had
chosen
him
to
be
the
champion
of
israel
he
spared
no
labour
to
accomplish
the
task
which
the
divine
favour
had
assigned
to
him
he
attacked
one
after
the
other
the

who
had
encroached
upon

the
first
to
feel
the

extended
his
possessions
at

expense
of
gilead
and
the
fertile
provinces
opposite
jericho
fell
to
his
sword
these
territories
were
in
dangerous
proximity
to
jerusalem
and
david
doubtless
realised
the
peril
of
their
independence
the
struggle
for
their
possession
must
have
continued
for
some
time
but
the
details
are
not
given

we
have
only
the
record

the
israelites
had
not
the
necessary
characteristics
of
a
conquering
people
their
history
from
the
time
of
their
entry
into
canaan
showed
it
is
true
that
they
were
by
no
means
incapable
of
enthusiasm
and
solidarity
a
leader
with
the
needful
energy
and
good
fortune
to
inspire
them
with
confidence
could
rouse
them
from
their
indolence
and
band
them
together
for
a
great
effort
but
such
concentration
of
purpose
was
ephemeral
in
its
nature
and
disappeared
with
the
chief
who
had
brought
it
about
in
his
absence
or
when
the
danger
he
had
pointed
out
was
no
longer
imminent
they
fell
back
instinctively
into
their
usual
state
of
apathy
and
disorganisation
their
nomadic
temperament
which
two
centuries
of
a
sedentary
existence
had
not
seriously
modified
disposed
them
to
give
way
to
tribal
quarrels
to
keep
up
hereditary
vendettas
to
break
out
into
sudden
tumults
or
to
make
pillaging
expeditions
into
their
territories
long
wars
requiring
the
maintenance
of
a
permanent
army
the
continual
levying
of
troops
and
taxes
and
a
prolonged
effort
to
keep
what
they
had
acquired
were
repugnant
to
them
the
kingdom
which
david
had
founded
owed
its
permanence
to
the
strong
will
of
its
originator
and
its
increase
or
even
its
maintenance
depended
upon
the
absence
of
any
internal
disturbance
or
court
intrigue
to
counteract
which
might
make
too
serious
a
drain
upon
his
energy
david
had
survived
his
last
victory
sufficiently
long
to
witness
around
him
the
evolution
of
plots
and
the
multiplication
of
the
usual
miseries
which
sadden
in
the
east
the
last
years
of
a
long
reign
it
was
a
matter
of
custom
as
well
as
policy
that
an
exaltation
in
the
position
of
a
ruler
should
be
accompanied
by
a
proportional
increase
in
the
number
of
his
retinue
and
his
wives
david
was
no
exception
to
this
custom
to
the
two
wives
abigail
and
ahinoam
which
he
had
while
he
was
in
exile
at
ziklag
he
now
added
maacah
the
aramaean
daughter
of
the
king
of
geshur
haggith
abital
bglah
and
several
others
during
the
siege
of
he
also
committed
adultery
with
bathsheba
the
wife
of
uriah
the
hittite
and
placing
her
husband
in
the
forefront
of
the
battle
brought
about
his
death
rebuked
by
the
prophet
nathan
for
this
crime
he
expressed
his
penitence
but
he
continued
at
the
same
time
to
keep
bathsheba
by
whom
he
had
several
children
there
was
considerable
rivalry
among
the
progeny
of
these
different
unions
as
the
right
of
succession
would
appear
not
to
have
been
definitely
settled
of
the
family
of
saul
moreover
there
were
still
several
members
in
existence
the
son
which
he
had
by
eizpah
the
children
of
his
daughter
merab
the
lame
offspring
of
jonathan
and
all
of
whom
had
partisans
among

the
eldest
son
of
ahinoam
amnon
whose
priority
in
age
seemed
likely
to
secure
for
him
the
crown
had
fallen
in
love
with
one
of
his
named
tamar
the
daughter
of
maacah
and
instead
of
demanding
her
in
marriage
procured
her
attendance
on
him
by
a
feigned
illness
and
forced
her
to
accede
to
his
desires
his
love
was
thereupon
converted
immediately
into
hate
and
instead
of
marrying
her
he
had
her
expelled
from
his
house
by
his
servants
with
rent
garments
and
ashes
on
her
head
she
fled
to
her
absalom
david
was
very
wroth
but
he
loved
his
firstborn
and
could
not
permit
himself
to
punish
him
absalom
kept
his
anger
to
himself
but
when
two
years
had
elapsed
he
invited
amnon
to
a
banquet
killed
him
and
fled
to
his
grandfather
talmai
king
of
geshur
it
is
to
be
noted
that
tamar
asked
amnon
to
marry
her
and
that
the
sole
reproach
directed
against
the
eldest
son
was
that
after
forcing
her
he
was
unwilling
to
make
her
his
wife
unions
of
brother
and
sister
were
probably
as
legitimate
among
the
hebrews
at
this
time
as
among
the
egyptians
his
anger
was
now
turned
against
the
king
for
not
having
taken
up
the
cause
of
his
sister
and
he
began
to
meditate
his
dethronement
having
been
recalled
to
jerusalem
at
the
instigation
of
joab
prepared
him
chariots
and
horses
and
fifty
men
to
run
before
him
thus
affecting
the
outward
forms
of
royalty
judah
dissatisfied
at
the
favour
shown
by
david
to
the
other
tribes
soon
came
to
recognise
absalom
as
their
chief
and
some
of
the
most
intimate
counsellors
of
the
aged
king
began
secretly
to
take
his
part
when
absalom
deemed
things
safe
for
action
he
betook
himself
to
hebron
under
the
pretence
of
a
vow
which
he
had
made
daring
his
sojourn
at
geshur
all
judah
rallied
around
him
and
the
excitement
at
jerusalem
was
so
great
that
david
judged
it
prudent
to
retire
with
his
philistine
and
cherethite
guards
to
the
other
side
of
the
jordan
absalom
in
the
mean
while
took
up
his
abode
in
jerusalem
where
having
received
the
tacit
adherence
of
the
family
of
saul
and
of
a
number
of
the
notables
he
made
himself
king
to
show
that
the
rupture
between
him
and
david
was
complete
he
had
tents
erected
on
the
top
of
the
house
and
there
in
view
of
the
people
took
possession
of
his
harem
success
would
have
been
assured
to
him
if
he
had
promptly
sent
troops
after
the
fugitives
but
while
he
was
spending
his
time
in
inactivity
and
feasting
david
collected
together
those
who
were
faithful
to
him
and
put
them
under
the
command
of
joab
and
abishai
the
veterans
were
more
than
a
match
for
the
undisciplined
rabble
which
opposed
them
and
in
the
action
which
followed
at
mahanaim
absalom
was
defeated
in
his
flight
through
the
forest
of
ephraim
he
was
caught
in
a
tree
and
before
he
could
disentangle
himself
was
pierced
through
the
heart
by
joab
david
we
read
wished
his
people
to
have
mercy
on
his
son
and
he
wept
bitterly
he
spared
on
this
occasion
the
family
of
saul
pardoned
the
tribe
of
judah
and
went
back
triumphantly
into
jerusalem
which
a
few
days
before
had
taken
part
in
his
humiliation
the
tribes
of
the
house
of
joseph
had
taken
no
side
in
the
quarrel
they
were
ignorant
alike
of
the
motives
which
set
the
tribe
of
judah
against
their
own
hero
and
of
their
reasons
for
the
zeal
with
which
they
again
established
him
on
the
throne
they
sent
delegates
to
inquire
about
this
who
reproached
judah
for
acting
without
their
cognisance
have
ten
parts
in
the
king
and
we
have
also
more
right
in
david
than
ye
why
then
did
ye
despise
us
that
our
advice
should
not
be
first
had
in
bringing
back
our
king
judah
answered
with
yet
fiercer
words
then
sheba
a
chief
of
the
benjamites
losing
patience
blew
a
trumpet
and
went
off
crying
have
no
portion
in
david
neither
have
we
inheritance
in
the
son
of
jesse
every
man
to
his
tents
o
if
these
words
had
produced
an
echo
among
the
central
and
northern
tribes
a
schism
would
have
been
inevitable
some
approved
of
them
while
others
took
no
action
and
since
judah
showed
no
disposition
to
put
its
military
forces
into
movement
the
king
had
once
again
to
trust
to
joab
and
the
philistine
guards
to
repress
the
sedition
their
appearance
on
the
scene
disconcerted
the
rebels
and
sheba
retreated
to
the
northern
frontier
without
offering
battle
perhaps
he
reckoned
on
the
support
of
the
aramæans
he
took
shelter
in
the
small
stronghold
of
abel
of
bethmaacah
where
he
defended
himself
for
some
time
but
just
when
the
place
was
on
the
point
of
yielding
the
inhabitants
cut
off
head
and
threw
it
to
joab
from
the
wall
his
death
brought
the
crisis
to
an
end
and
peace
reigned
in
israel
intrigues
however
began
again
more
persistently
than
ever
over
the
inheritance
which
the
two
slain
princes
had
failed
to
obtain
the
eldest
son
of
the
king
was
now
adonijah
son
of
haggith
but
bathsheba
exercised
an
undisputed
sway
over
her
husband
and
had
prepared
him
to
recognise
in
solomon
her
son
the
heir
to
the
throne
she
had
secured
too
as
his
adherents
several
persons
of
influence
including
zadok
the
prophet
nathan
and
benaiah
the
captain
of
the
foreign
guard
adonijah
had
on
his
side
abiathar
the
priest
joab
and
the
people
of
jerusalem
who
had
been
captivated
by
his
beauty
and
his
regal
display
in
the
midst
of
these
rivalries
the
king
was
daily
becoming
weaker
he
was
now
very
old
and
although
he
was
covered
with
wrappings
he
could
not
maintain
his
animal
heat
a
young
girl
was
sought
out
for
him
to
give
him
the
needful
warmth
abishag
a
shunammite
was
secured
for
the
purpose
but
her
beauty
inspired
adonijah
with
such
a
violent
passion
that
he
decided
to
bring
matters
to
a
crisis
he
invited
his
brethren
with
the
exception
of
solomon
to
a
banquet
in
the
gardens
which
belonged
to
him
in
the
south
of
jerusalem
near
the
well
of
eôgel
all
his
partisans
were
present
and
inspired
by
the
good
cheer
began
to
cry
save
king
adonijah
when
nathan
informed
bathsheba
of
what
was
going
on
she
went
in
unto
the
king
who
was
being
attended
on
by
abishag
complained
to
him
of
the
weakness
he
was
showing
in
regard
to
his
eldest
son
and
besought
him
to
designate
his
heir
officially
he
collected
together
the
soldiers
and
charged
them
to
take
the
young
man
solomon
with
royal
pomp
from
the
hill
of
sion
to
the
source
of
the
gibôn
nathan
anointed
his
forehead
with
the
sacred
oil
and
in
the
sight
of
all
the
people
brought
him
to
the
palace
mounted
on
his
mule
the
blare
of
the
coronation
trumpets
resounded
in
the
ears
of
the
conspirators
quickly
followed
by
the
tidings
that
solomon
had
been
hailed
king
over
the
whole
of
israel
they
fled
on
all
sides
adonijah
taking
refuge
at
the
horns
of
the
altar
david
did
not
long
survive
this
event
shortly
before
his
death
he
advised
solomon
to
rid
himself
of
all
those
who
had
opposed
his
accession
to
the
throne
solomon
did
not
hesitate
to
follow
this
counsel
and
the
beginning
of
his
reign
was
marked
by
a
series
of
bloodthirsty
executions
adonijah
was
the
first
to
suffer
he
had
been
unwise
enough
to
ask
the
hand
of
abishag
in
marriage
this
request
was
regarded
as
indicative
of
a
hidden
intention
to
rebel
and
furnished
an
excuse
for
his
assassination
abiathar
at
whose
instigation
adonijah
had
acted
owed
his
escape
from
a
similar
fate
to
his
priestly
character
and
past
services
he
was
banished
to
his
estate
at
anathoth
and
zadok
became
high
priest
in
his
stead
joab
on
learning
the
fate
of
his
accomplice
felt
that
he
was
a
lost
man
and
vainly
sought
sanctuary
near
the
ark
of
the
lord
but
benaiah
slew
him
there
and
soon
after
shimei
the
last
survivor
of
the
race
of
saul
was
put
to
death
on
some
transparent
pretext
this
was
the
last
act
of
the
tragedy
henceforward
solomon
freed
from
all
those
who
bore
him
malice
was
able
to
devote
his
whole
attention
to
the
cares
of
government
kings
ii
this
is
the
close
of
the
history
of
david
and
follows
on
from
sam
xxiv
it
would
seem
that
adonijah
was
kings
i
and
that
accession
was
brought
about
by
an
intrigue
which
owed
its
success
to
the
old
weakness
kings
i
the
change
of
rulers
had
led
as
usual
to
insurrections
among
the
tributary
races
damascus
had
revolted
before
the
death
of
david
and
had
not
been
recovered
hadad
returned
from
egypt
and
having
gained
adherents
in
certain
parts
of
edom
resisted
all
attempts
made
to
dislodge
him
it
seems
clear
from
the
context
that
the
revolt
of
damascus
took
place
during
lifetime
it
can
not
in
any
case
have
occurred
at
a
later
date
than
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
solomon
for
we
are
told
that
rezôn
after
capturing
the
town
an
adversary
of
israel
all
the
days
of
kings
xi
hadad
returned
from
egypt
when
had
heard
that
david
slept
with
his
fathers
and
that
joab
the
captain
of
the
host
was
kings
xi
as
a
soldier
solomon
was
neither
skilful
nor
fortunate
he
even
failed
to
retain
what
his
father
had
won
for
him
though
he
continued
to
increase
his
army
it
was
more
with
a
view
to
consolidating
his
power
over
the
than
for
any
aggressive
action
outside
his
borders
on
the
other
hand
he
showed
himself
an
excellent
administrator
and
did
his
best
by
various
measures
of
general
utility
to
draw
closer
the
ties
which
bound
the
tribes
to
him
and
to
each
other
he
repaired
the
citadels
with
such
means
as
he
had
at
his
disposal
he
rebuilt

towards

a
certain
king
abîbaal
had
arisen
in

was
succeeded
by
his
son
hiram
at
the
very
moment
when
david
was
engaged
in
bringing
the
whole
of
israel
into
subjection
hiram
guided
by
instinct
or
by
tradition
at
once
adopted
a
policy
towards
the
rising
dynasty
which
his
ancestors
had
always
found
successful
in
similar
cases
he
made
friendly
overtures
to
the
hebrews
and
constituted
himself
their
broker
and
general
provider
when

was
in
want
of

for

house
he
was
building
at

sam
cf
the
reference
to
the
same
incident
in

v
the
accession
of
solomon
was
a
piece
of
good
luck
for
him
the
new
king
born
in
the
purple
did
not
share
the
simple
and
somewhat
rustic
tastes
of
his
father
he
wanted
palaces
and
gardens
and
a
temple
which
might
rival
even
if
only
in
a
small
way
the
palaces
and
temples
of
egypt
and
chaldæa
of
which
he
had
heard
such
glowing
accounts
hiram
undertook
to
procure
these
things
for
him
at
a
moderate
cost
and
it
was
doubtless
his
influence
which
led
to
those
voyages
to
the
countries
which
produced
precious
metals
perfumes
rare
animals
costly
woods
and
all
those
foreign
knicknacks
with
which
eastern
monarchs
of

loved

the

of
them
having
heard

when
in

a
few
perhaps
having
gone
thither
under
the
direction
and
by
the
orders
of
pharaoh
and
hiram
took
advantage
of
the
access
which
the
hebrews
had
gained
to
the
shores
of
the
red
sea
by
the
annexation
of
edom
to
establish
relations
with
these
outlying
districts
without
having
to
pass
the
egyptian
customs
he
lent
to
solomon
shipwrights
and
sailors
who
helped
him
to
fit
out
a
fleet
at

undertook
a
voyage
of
discovery
in
company
with
a
number
of
hebrews
who
were
no
doubt
despatched
in
the
same
capacity
as
the
royal
messengers
sent
with
the
galleys
of
hâtshopsîtû
it
was
a
venture
similar
to
those
so
frequently
undertaken
by
the
egyptian
admirals
in
the
palmy

of
the
theban
navy

in

a
freight
well
calculated
to
convince
the
most
sceptical
consisting
as
it
did
of
four
hundred
and
twenty
talents
of

the
success
of
this
first
venture
encouraged
solomon
to
persevere
in
such
expeditions
he
sent
his

made

it
is
possible
that
the
numbers
may
have
been
somewhat
exaggerated
in
popular
estimation
since
the
greatest
egyptian
monuments
never
required
such
formidable
levies
of
workmen
for
their
construction
we
must
remember
however
that
such
an
undertaking
demanded
a
considerable
effort
as
the
hebrews
were
quite
unaccustomed
to
that
kind
of
labour
the

was
twenty

could
be
interpreted
in
various
ways
the
most
simple
interpretation
is
to
recognise
in
them
a
kind
of
talismanic
formula
to
ensure
the
strength
of
the
building
affirming
it
exists

the

the

a

with

was
approached
by

resembled
probably
in

outline
the
monumental

with
admiration

their

knowledge

led

to
consider

nothing
remarkable

contains
a
long
prayer
by

part
of
which
vers
is
thought
by
certain
critics
to
be
of
later
date
they
contend
that
the
original
words
of
solomon
are
confined
to
vers
and
the
priests
to
whose
care
it
was
entrusted
did
not
differ
much
from
those
whom
david
had
gathered
about
him
at
the
outset
of
the
monarchy
they
in
no
way
formed
an
hereditary
caste
confined
to
the
limits
of
a
rigid
hierarchy
they
admitted
into
their
number
at
least
up
to
a
certain
point
men
of
varied
extraction
who
were
either
drawn
by
their
own
inclinations
to
the
service
of
the
altar
or
had
been
dedicated
to
it
by
their
parents
from
childhood
he
indeed
was
truly
a
priest
said
of
his
father
and
mother
have
not
seen
him
neither
did
he
acknowledge
his
brethren
nor
knew
he
his
own
he
was
content
after
renouncing
these
to
observe
the
law
of
god
and
keep
his
covenant
and
to
teach
jacob
his
judgments
and
israel
his
law
he
put
incense
before
the
lord
and
whole
burnt
offerings
upon
his
altar

are
the
expressions

deut
xxxiii
though
this
text
is
by
some
writers
placed
as
late
as
the
viiith
century
yet
the
state
of
things
there
represented
would
apply
also
to
an
earlier
date
the
hebrew
priest
in
short
had
the
same
duties
as
a
large
proportion
of
the
priesthood
in
chaldæ
and
egypt
as
in
egypt
the
correct
offering
of
the
jewish
sacrifices
was
beset
with
considerable
difficulties
and
the
risk
of
marring
their
efficacy
by
the
slightest
inadvertence
necessitated
the
employment
of
men
who
were
thoroughly
instructed
in
the
divinely
appointed
practices
and
formulæ
the
victims
had
to
be
certified
as
perfect
while
the
offerers
themselves
had
to
be
ceremonially
pure
and
indeed
those
only
who
had
been
specially
trained
were
able
to
master
the
difficulties
connected
with
the
minutiae
of
legal
purity
the
means
by
which
the
future
was
made
known
necessitated
the
intervention
of
skilful
interpreters
of
the
divine
will
we
know
that
in
egypt
the
statues
of
the
gods
were
supposed
to
answer
the
questions
put
to
them
by
movements
of
the
head
or
arms
sometimes
even
by
the
living
voice
but
the
hebrews
do
not
appear
to
have
been
influenced
by
any
such
recollections
in
the
use
of
their
sacred
oracles
we
are
ignorant
however
of
the
manner
in
which
the
ephod
was
consulted
and
we
know
merely
that
the
art
of
interrogating
the
divine
will
by
it
demanded
a
long
noviciate
the
benefits
derived
by
those
initiated
into
these
mysteries
were
such
as
to
cause
them
to
desire
the
privileges
to
be
perpetuated
to
their
children
gathered
round
the
ancient
sanctuaries
were
certain
families
who
from
father
to
son
were
devoted
to
the
performance
of
the
sacred
rites
as
for
instance
that
of
eli
at
shiloh
and
that
of
at
dan
near
the
sources
of
the
jordan
but
in
addition
to
these
the
text
mentions
functionaries
analogous
to
those
found
among
the
canaanites
diviners
seers
who
had
means
of
discovering
that
which
was
hidden
from
the
vulgar
even
to
the
finding
of
lost
objects
but
whose
powers
sometimes
rose
to
a
higher
level
when
they
were
suddenly
possessed
by
the
prophetic
spirit
and
enabled
to
reveal
coming
events
besides
these
again
were
the
prophets
who
lived
either
alone
or
in
communities
and
attained
by
means
of
a
strict
training
to
a
vision
of
the
future
an
example
of
the
consulting
of
the
ephod
will
be
found
in
sam
xxx
where
david
desires
to
know
if
he
shall
pursue
the
amalekites
sam
ix
is
a
gloss
which
identifies
the
of
former
times
with
the
prophet
of
the
times
of
the
monarchy
their
prophetic
utterances
were
accompanied
by
music
and
singing
and
the
exaltation
of
spirit
which
followed
their
exercises
would
at
times
spread
to
the
bystanders
as
is
the
case
in
the
of
the
mahomedans
of
sam
x
where
we
see
saul
seized
with
the
prophetic
spirit
on
meeting
with
a
band
of
prophets
descending
from
the
high
place
cf
sam
vi
for
david
dancing
before
the
ark
the
early
kings
saul
and
david
used
to
have
recourse
to
individuals
belonging
to
all
these
three
classes
but
the
prophets
owing
to
the
intermittent
character
of
their
inspiration
and
their
ministry
could
not
fill
a
regular
office
attached
to
the
court
one
of
this
class
was
raised
up
by
god
from
time
to
time
to
warn
or
guide
his
servants
and
then
sank
again
into
obscurity
the
priests
on
the
contrary
were
always
at
hand
and
their
duties
brought
them
into
contact
with
the
sovereign
all
the
year
round
the
god
who
was
worshipped
in
the
capital
of
the
country
and
his
priesthood
promptly
acquired
a
predominant
position
in
all
oriental
monarchies
and
most
of
the
other
temples
together
with
the
sacerdotal
bodies
attached
to
them
usually
fell
into
disrepute
leaving
them
supreme
if
amon
of
thebes
became
almost
the
sole
god
and
his
priests
the
possessors
of
all
egypt
it
was
because
the
accession
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
had
made
his
pontiffs
the
almoners
of
the
pharaoh
something
of
the
same
sort
took
place
in
israel
the
priesthood
at
jerusalem
attached
to
the
temple
built
by
the
sovereign
being
constantly
about
his
person
soon
surpassed
their
brethren
in
other
parts
of
the
country
both
in
influence
and
possessions
under

their
head
had
been
abiathar
son
of
ahimelech
a
descendant

on

the
primacy
had
been
transferred
to
the
line
of
zadok
in
this
alliance
of
the
throne
and
the
altar
it
was
natural
at
first
that
the
throne
should
reap
the
advantage
the
king
appears
to
have
continued
to
be
a
sort
of
high
priest
and
to
have
officiated
at
certain
times
and
occasions
the
priests
kept
the
temple
in
order
and
watched
over
the
cleanliness
of
its
chambers
and
its
vessels
they
interrogated
the
divine
will
for
the
king
according
to
the
prescribed
ceremonies
and
offered
sacrifices
on
behalf
of
the
monarch
and
his
subjects
in
short
they
were
at
first
little
more
than
chaplains
to
the
king
and
his
family
solomon
officiated
and
preached
at
the
consecration
of
the
temple
kings
the
actual
words
appear
to
be
of
a
later
date
but
even
if
that
be
the
case
it
proves
that
at
the
time
they
were
written
the
king
still
possessed
his
full
sacerdotal
powers
allegiance
to
the
god
of

did
not
lead
him
to
proscribe
the
worship
of

gods
he
allowed
his
foreign
wives
the
exercise
of
their
various
religions
and
he
raised
an
altar
to
chemosh
on
the
mount
of

one
of

who
was
a
moabite
the
political
supremacy
and
material
advantages
which
all
these
establishments
acquired
for
judah
could
not
fail
to
rouse
the
jealousy
of
the
other
tribes
ephraim
particularly
looked
on
with
anger
at
the
prospect
of
the
hegemony
becoming
established
in
the
hands
of
a
tribe
which
could
be
barely
said
to
have
existed
before
the
time
of
david
and
was
to
a
considerable
extent
of
barbarous
origin
taxes
homage
the
keeping
up
and
recruiting
of
garrisons
were
all
equally
odious
to
this
as
well
as
to
the
other
clans

from
joseph

their
burdens
did
not
decrease

to

of

overseers
appointed
for
this
work
jeroboam
the
son
of

appears
to
have
stirred
up

to
have
hatched

of
the
conspiracy

to
suppress

was
forewarned
and
fled
to
egypt
where

received
him
with
honour
and
gave
him
his
sister
in
marriage
the
peace
of

had
not
been
ostensibly
troubled
but
the
very
fact
that
a
pretender
should
have
risen
up
in
opposition
to
the
legitimate
king
augured
ill
for
the
future
of

reality
the
edifice
which
david

raised
with
such
difficulty
tottered
on
its

either
in

with

the

which
their

had
addressed
to
the

and
surrounded
its
memory
with
a
halo
of
romance
david
again
became
the
hero
and

the
saint
and
sage
of
his
race
the
latter
three
thousand
proverbs
and
his
songs
were
a
thousand
and
five
and
he
spake
of

from

cedar
that
is
in

even
unto
the
hyssop
that
springeth
out
of

he
spake
also
of

and
of

and
of

things
and
of
we
are
told
that
god
favoured
him
with
a
special
predilection
and
appeared
to
him
on
three
separate
occasions
once
immediately
after
the
death
of
david
to
encourage
him
by
the
promise
of
a
prosperous
reign
and
the
gift
of
wisdom
in
governing
again
after
the
dedication
of

to

in

is
supposed
to
have
had
continuous

as

on

to
have
entered
with

of
neighbouring
countries
traces
of
these
are
found
in

in

and
in

his

however
seem
to
have
regarded
him
as
a
tyrant
who

whose

was
unregretted

king

and
the
queen

his
son
rehoboam
experienced
no
opposition
in
jerusalem
and
judah
on
succeeding
to
the
throne
of
his
father
when
however
he
repaired
to
shechem
to
receive
the
oath
of
allegiance
from
the
northern
and
central
tribes
he
found
them
unwilling
to
tender
it
except
under
certain
conditions
they
would
consent
to
obey
him
only
on
the
promise
of
his
delivering
them
from
the
forced
labour
which
had
been
imposed
upon
them
by
his
predecessors
jeroboam
who
had
returned
from
his
egyptian
exile
on
the
news
of
death
undertook
to
represent
their
grievances
to
the
new
king

grievous

therefore
make
thou
the
grievous
service
of
thy
father
and
his
heavy
yoke
which
he
put
upon
us
lighter
and
we
will
serve
rehoboam
demanded
three
days
for
the
consideration
of
his
reply
he
took
counsel
with
the
old
advisers
of
the
late
king
who
exhorted
him
to
comply
with
the
petition
but
the
young
men
who
were
his
habitual
companions
urged
him
on
the
contrary
to
meet
the
remonstrances
of
his
subjects
with
threats
of
still
harsher
exactions
their
advice
was
taken
and
when
jeroboam
again
presented
himself
rehoboam
greeted
him
with
raillery
and
threats
little
finger
is
thicker
than
my
loins
and
now
whereas
my
father
did
lade
you
with
a
heavy
yoke
i
will
add
to
your
yoke
my
father
chastised
you
with
whips
but
i
will
chastise
you
with
this
unwise
answer
did
not
produce
the
intimidating
effect
which
was
desired
the
cry
of
revolt
which
had
already
been
raised
in
the
earlier
days
of
the
monarchy
was
once

david
neither
have
we
inheritance
in
the
son
of
jesse
to
your
tents
o
israel
now
see
to
thine
own
house
rehoboam
attempted
to
carry
his
threats
into
execution
and
sent
the
collectors
of
taxes
among
the
rebels
to
enforce
payment
but
one
of
them
was
stoned
almost
before
his
eyes
and
the
king
himself
had
barely
time
to
regain
his
chariot
and
flee
to
jerusalem
to
escape
an
outburst
of
popular
fury
the
northern
and
central
tribes
immediately
offered
the
crown
to
jeroboam
and
the
partisans
of
the
son
of
solomon
were
reduced
to
those
of
his
own
tribe
judah
caleb
the
few
remaining
simeonites
and
some
of
the
towns
of
dan
and
benjamin
which
were
too
near
to
jerusalem
to
escape
the
influence
of
a
great
city
were
all
who
threw
in
their
lot
with
him
kings
xii
cf
chron
xi
the
text
of
kings
xii
expressly
says
was
none
that
followed
the
house
of
david
but
the
tribe
of
judah
only
whereas
the
following
verse
which
some
think
to
have
been
added
by
another
hand
adds
that
rehoboam
assembled
men
were
from
house
of
judah
and
the
tribe
of
thus
was
accomplished
the
downfall
of
the
house
of
david
and
with
it
the
hebrew
kingdom
which
it
had
been
at
such
pains
to
build
up
when
we
consider
the
character
of
the
two
kings
who
formed
its
sole
dynasty
we
can
not
refrain
from
thinking
that
it
deserved
a
better
fate
david
and
solomon
exhibited
that
curious
mixture
of
virtues
and
vices
which
distinguished
most
of
the
great
semite
princes
the
former
a
soldier
of
fortune
and
an
adventurous
hero
represents
the
regular
type
of
the
founder
of
a
dynasty
crafty
cruel
ungrateful
and
dissolute
but
at
the
same
time
brave
prudent
cautious
generous
and
capable
of
enthusiasm
clemency
and
repentance
at
once
so
lovable
and
so
gentle
that
he
was
able
to
inspire
those
about
him
with
the
firmest
friendship
and
the
most
absolute
devotion
the
latter
was
a
religious
though
sensual
monarch
fond
of
display
the
type
of
sovereign
who
usually
succeeds
to
the
head
of
the
family
and
enjoys
the
wealth
which
his
predecessor
had
acquired
displaying
before
all
men
the
results
of
an
accomplished
work
and
often
thereby
endangering
its
stability
the
real
reason
of
their
failure
to
establish
a
durable
monarchy
was
the
fact
that
neither
of
them
understood
the
temperament
of
the
people
they
were
called
upon
to
govern
the
few
representations
we
possess
of
the
hebrews
of
this
period
depict
them
as
closely
resembling
the
nations
which
inhabited
southern
syria
at
the
time
of
the
egyptian
occupation
they
belong
to
the
type
with
which
the
monuments
have
made
us
familiar
they
are
distinguished
by
an
aquiline
nose
projecting
and
curly
hair
and
beard
they
were
vigorous
hardy
and
inured
to
fatigue
but
though
they
lacked
those
qualities
of
discipline
and
obedience
which
are
the
characteristics
of
true
warrior
races
david
had
not
hesitated
to
employ
them
in
war
they
were
neither
sailors
builders
nor
given
to
commerce
and
industries
and
yet
solomon
built
fleets
raised
palaces
and
a
temple
and
undertook
maritime
expeditions
and
financial
circumstances
seemed
for
the
moment
to
be
favourable

onward
progress

by

hittites
egypt
was
in
a
condition
of
lethargy
the
aramæan
populations
were
fretting
away
their
energies
in
internal
dissensions
david
having
encountered
no
serious
opposition
after
his
victory
over
the
philistines
had
extended
his
conquests
and
increased
the
area
of
his
kingdom
and
the
interested
assistance
which
tyre
afterwards
gave
to
solomon
enabled
the
latter
to
realise
his
dreams
of
luxury
and
royal
magnificence
but
the
kingdom
which
had
been
created
by
david
and
solomom
rested
solely
on
their
individual
efforts
and
its
continuance
could
be
ensured
only
by
bequeathing
it
to
descendants
who
had
sufficient
energy
and
prudence
to
consolidate
its
weaker
elements
and
build
up
the
tottering
materials
which
were
constantly
threatening
to
fall
asunder
as
soon
as
the
government
had
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
weakling
rehoboam
who
had
at
the
outset
departed
from
his
policy
the
component
parts
of
the
kingdom
which
had
for
a
few
years
been
held
together
now
became
disintegrated
without
a
shock
and
as
if
by
mutual
consent
the
old
order
of
things
which
existed
in
the
time
of
the
judges
had
passed
away
with
the
death
of
saul
the
advantages
which
ensued
from
a
monarchical
regime
were
too
apparent
to
permit
of
its
being
set
aside
and
the
tribes
who
had
been
bound
together
by
nearly
half
a
century
of
obedience
to
a
common
master
now
resolved
themselves
according
to
their
geographical
positions
into
two
masses
of
unequal
numbers
and
extent
judah
in
the
south
together
with
the
few
clans
who
remained
loyal
to
the
kingly
house
and
israel
in
the
north
and
the
regions
beyond
jordan
occupying
of
the
territory
which
had
belonged
to
david
and
solomon
israel
in
spite
of
its
extent
and
population
did
not
enjoy
the
predominant
position
which
we
might
have
expected
at
the
beginning
of
its
independent
existence
it
had
no
political
unity
no
capital
in
which
to
concentrate
its
resources
no
temple
and
no
army
it
represented
the
material
out
of
which
a
state
could
be
formed
rather
than
one
already
constituted
it
was
subdivided
into
three
groups
formerly
independent
of
and
almost
strangers
to
each
other
and
between
whom
neither
david
nor
solomon
had
been
able
to
establish
any
bond
which
would
enable
them
to
forget
their
former
isolation
the
centre
group
was
composed
of
the
house
of
joseph
ephraim
benjamin
and
manasseh
and
comprised
the
old
fortresses
of
perea
mahanaim
penuel
succoth
and
eamoth
ranged
in
a
line
running
parallel
with
the
jordan
in
the
eastern
group
were
the
tribes
of
reuben
and
gad
who
still
persisted
in
the
pastoral
habits
of
their
ancestors
and
remained
indifferent
to
the
various
revolutions
which
had
agitated
their
race
for
several
generations
finally
in
the
northern
group
lay
the
smaller
tribes
of
asher
naphtali
issachar
zebulon
and
dan
hemmed
in
between
the
phoenicians
and
the
aramaeans
of
zoba
and
damascus
each
group
had
its
own
traditions
its
own
interests
often
opposed
to
those
of
its
neighbours
and
its
own
peculiar
mode
of
life
which
it
had
no
intention
of
renouncing
for
any
one
benefit
the
difficulty
of
keeping
these
groups
together
became
at
once
apparent
shechem
had
been
the
first
to
revolt
against
rehoboam
it
was
a
large
and
populous
town
situated
almost
in
the
centre
of
the
newly
formed
state
and
the
seat
of
an
ancient
oracle
both
of
which
advantages
seemed
to
single
it
out
as
the
future
capital
but
its
very
importance
and
the
memories
of
its
former
greatness
under
jeruhhaal
and
abimelech
were
against
it
built
in
the
western
territory
belonging
to
manasseh
the
eastern
and
northern
clans
would
at
once
object
to
its
being
chosen
on
the
ground
that
it
would
humiliate
them
before
the
house
of
joseph
in
the
same
manner
as
the
selection
of
jerusalem
had
tended
to
make
them
subservient
to
judah
jeroboam
would
have
endangered
his
cause
by
fixing
on
it
as
his
capital
and
he
therefore
soon
quitted
it
to
establish
himself
at
tirzah
it
is
true
that
the
latter
town
was
also
situated
in
the
mountains
of
ephraim
but
it
was
so
obscure
and
insignificant
a
place
that
it
disarmed
all
jealousy
the
new
king
therefore
took
up
his
residence
in
it
since
he
was
forced
to
fix
on
some
royal
abode
but
it
never
became
for
him
what
jerusalem
was
to
his
rival
a
capital
at
once
religious
and
military
he
had
his
own
sanctuary
and
priests
at
tirzah
as
was
but
natural
but
had
he
attempted
to
found
a
temple
which
would
have
attracted
the
whole
population
to
a
common
worship
he
would
have
excited
jealousies
which
would
have
been
fatal
to
his
authority
on
the
other
hand
temple
had
in
its
short
period
of
existence
not
yet
acquired
such
a
prestige
as
to
prevent
drawing
his
people
away
from
it
which
he
determined
to
do
from
a
fear
that
contact
with
jerusalem
would
endanger
the
allegiance
of
his
subjects
to
his
person
and
family
such
concourses
of
worshippers
assembling
at
periodic
intervals
from
all
parts
of
the
country
soon
degenerated
into
a
kind
of
fair
in
which
commercial
as
well
as
religious
motives
had
their
part

the
mound
and

capital
they
were
held
and

well
as
political
considerations
required
that
periodical
assemblies
should
be
established
in
israel
similar
to
those
which
attracted
judah
to
jerusalem
jeroboam
adopted
a
plan
which
while
safeguarding
the
interests
of
his
treasury
prevented
his
becoming
unpopular
with
his
own
subjects
as
he
was
unable
to
have
a
temple
for
himself
alone
he
chose
two
out
of
the
most
venerated
ancient
sanctuaries
that
of
dan
for
the
northern
tribes
and
that
of
bethel
on
the
judæan
frontier
for
the
tribes
of
the
east
and
centre
he
made
two
calves
of
gold
one
for
each
place
and
said
to
the
people
is
too
much
for
you
to
go
up
to
jerusalem
behold
thy
gods
o
israel
which
brought
thee
up
out
of
the
land
of
he
granted
the
sanctuaries
certain
appanages
and
established
a
priesthood
answering
to
that
which
officiated
in
the
rival
kingdom
would
he
consecrated
him
that
there
might
be
priests
of
the
high
while
jeroboam
thus
endeavoured
to
strengthen
himself
on
the
throne
by
adapting
the
monarchy
to
the
temperament
of
the
tribes
over
which
he
ruled
rehoboam
took
measures
to
regain
his
lost
ground
and
restore
the
unity
which
he
himself
had
destroyed
he
recruited
the
army
which
had
been
somewhat
neglected
in
the
latter
years
of
his
father
restored
the
walls
of
the
cities
which
had
remained
faithful
to
him
and
fortified
the
places
which
constituted
his
frontier
defences
against
the
israelites
his
ambition
was
not
as
foolish
as
we
might
be
tempted
to
imagine
he
had
soldiers
charioteers
generals

a
new
egypt
had
arisen
not
without
storm
and
struggle
in
its
place
as
long
as
the
campaigns
of
the
pharaohs
had
been
confined

not

the
foremost

it
represented
the
country

the
heart
of
egypt
may
be
said
to
have
throbbed

its

after

of

conquest
of

upon

disputed
the
honour
of
forming

all
in

during

course
of
ages
enjoyed
the
privilege
without
ever
rising
to
the
rank
of
thebes
or
producing
any
sovereigns
to
be
compared
with
those
of
her
triumphant
dynasties
tanis
was
as
we
have
seen
the
first
of
these
to
rule
the
whole
of
the
nile
valley
its
prosperity
had
continued
to
increase
from
the
time
that
ramses
ii
began
to
rebuild
it
the
remaining
inhabitants
of
avaris
mingled
with
the
natives
of
pure
race
and
the
prisoners
of
war
settled
there
had
furnished
it
with
an
active
and
industrious
population
which
had
considerably
increased
during
the
peaceful
reigns
of
the
xxth
dynasty
the
surrounding
country
drained
and
cultivated
by
unremitting
efforts
became
one
of
the
most
fruitful
parts
of
the
delta
there
was
a
large
exportation
of
fish
and
corn
to
which
were
soon
added
the
various
products
of
its
manufactories
such
as
linen
and
woollen
stuffs
ornaments
and
objects
in
glass
and
in
precious
metals
the
immense
number
of
designs
taken
from
aquatic
plants
as
for
instance
the
papyrus
and
the
lotus
single
or
in
groups
as
well
as
from
fish
and
aquatic
birds
which
we
observe
on
objects
of
phoenician
work
leads
me
to
believe
that
the
tyrian
and
sidonian
artists
borrowed
most
of
their
models
from
the
delta
and
doubtless
from
tanis
the
most
flourishing
town
of
the
delta
during
the
centuries
following
the
downfall
of
thebes
these
were
embarked
on
egyptian
or
phoenician
galleys
and
were
exchanged
in
the
ports
of
the
mediterranean
for
syrian
asiatic
or
ægean
commodities
which
were
then
transmitted
by
the
egyptian
merchants
to
the
countries
of
the
east
and
to
northern
africa
the
port
of
tanis
was
one
of
the
most
secure
and
convenient
which
existed
at
that
period
it
was
at
sufficient
distance
from
the
coast
to
be
safe
from
the
sudden
attacks
of
pirates
and
yet
near
enough
to
permit
of
its
being
reached
from
the
open
by
merchantmen
in
a
few
hours
of
easy
navigation
the
arms
of
the
nile
and
the
canals
which
here
flowed
into
the
sea
were
broad
and
deep
and
so
long
as
they
were
kept
well
dredged
would
allow
the
vessel
of
large
draught
to
make
its
way
up
them
with
ease
it
was
from
tanis
that
the
egyptian
vessel
set
out
carrying
the
messengers
of
hrihor
to
byblos
we
may
judge
of
the
security
afforded
by
such
a
position
by
the
account
in
homer
which
ulysses
gives
to
eumaios
of
his
pretended
voyage
to
egypt
the
greeks
having
disembarked
and
being
scattered
over
the
country
were
attacked
by
the
egyptians
before
they
could
capture
a
town
or
carry
their
booty
to
the
ships
the
site
of
the
town
was
not
less
advantageous
for
overland
traffic
tanis
was
the
first
important
station
encountered
by
caravans
after
crossing
the
frontier
at
zalû
and
it
offered
them
a
safe
and
convenient
emporium
for
the
disposal
of
their
goods
in
exchange
for
the
riches
of
egypt
and
the
delta
the
combination
of
so
many
advantageous
features
on
one
site
tended
to
the
rapid
development
of
both
civic
and
individual
wealth
in
less
than
three
centuries
after
its
rebuilding
by
ramses
tanis
had
risen
to
a
position
which
enabled
its
sovereigns
to
claim
even
the
obedience
of
thebes
itself
we
know
very
little
of
the
history
of
this
tanite
dynasty
the
monuments
have
not
revealed
the
names
of
all
its
kings
and
much
difficulty
is
experienced
in
establishing
the
sequence
of
those
already
brought
to
light
the
classification
of
the
tanite
line
has
been
complicated
in
the
minds
of
most
egyptologists
by
the
tendency
to
ignore
the
existence
of
the
sacerdotal
dynasty
of
high
priests
to
confuse
with
the
tanite
pharaohs
those
of
the
high
priests
who
bore
the
crown
and
to
identify
in
the
lists
of
manetho
more
or
less
corrected
the
names
they
are
in
search
of
a
fresh
examination
of
the
subject
has
led
me
to
adopt
provisionally
the
following
order
for
the
series
of
tanite
kings
illustration
table
of
kings
their
actual
domain
barely
extended
as
far
as
siut
but
their
suzerainty
was
acknowledged
by
the
said
as
well
as
by
all
or
part
of
ethiopia
and
the
tanite
pharaohs
maintained
their
authority
with
such
vigour
that
they
had
it
in
their
power
on
several
occasions
to
expel
the
high
priests
of
amon
and
to
restore
at
least
for
a
time
the
unity
of
the
empire
to
accomplish
this
it
would
have
been
sufficient
for
them
to
have
assumed
the
priestly
dignity
at
thebes
and
this
was
what
no
doubt
took
place
at
times
when
a
vacancy
in
the
high
priesthood
occurred
but
it
was
merely
in
an
interim
and
the
tanite
sovereigns
always
relinquished
the
office
after
a
brief
lapse
of
time
in
favour
of
some
member
of
the
family
of
hrihor
whose
right
of
primogeniture
entitled
him
to
succeed
to
it
it
indeed
seemed
as
if
custom
and
religious
etiquette
had
made
the
two
offices
of
the
pontificate
and
the
royal
dignity
incompatible
for
one
individual
to
hold
simultaneously
the
priestly
duties
had
become
marvellously
complicated
during
the
theban
hegemony
and
the
minute
observances
which
they
entailed
absorbed
the
whole
life
of
those
who
dedicated
themselves
to
their
performance
this
is
only
true
if
the
personage
who
entitles
himself
once
within
a
cartouche
master
of
the
two
lands
first
prophet
of
amon
is
really
the
tanite
king
and
not
the
high
priest
psiûkhânnît
the
first
book
of
diodorus
contains
a
picture
of
the
life
of
the
kings
of
egypt
which
in
common
with
much
information
contained
in
the
work
is
taken
from
a
lost
book
of
hecataeus
the
historical
romance
written
by
the
latter
appears
to
have
been
composed
from
information
taken
from
theban
sources
the
comparison
of
it
with
the
inscribed
monuments
and
the
ritual
of
the
cultus
of
amon
proves
that
the
ideal
description
given
in
this
work
of
the
life
of
the
kings
merely
reproduces
the
chief
characteristics
of
the
lives
of
the
theban
and
ethiopian
high
priests
hence
the
greater
part
of
the
minute
observances
which
we
remark
therein
apply
to
the
latter
only
and
not
to
the
pharaohs
properly
so
called
they
had
daily
to
fulfil
a
multitude
of
rites
distributed
over
the
various
hours
in
such
a
manner
that
it
seemed
impossible
to
find
leisure
for
any
fresh
occupation
without
encroaching
on
the
time
allotted
to
absolute
bodily
needs
the
high
priest
rose
each
morning
at
an
appointed
hour
he
had
certain
times
for
taking
food
for
recreation
for
giving
audience
for
dispensing
justice
for
attending
to
worldly
affairs
and
for
relaxation
with
his
wives
and
children
at
night
he
kept
watch
or
rose
at
intervals
to
prepare
for
the
various
ceremonies
which
could
only
be
celebrated
at
sunrise
he
was
responsible
for
the
superintendence
of
the
priests
of
amon
in
the
numberless
festivals
held
in
honour
of
the
gods
from
which
he
could
not
absent
himself
except
for
some
legitimate
reason
from
all
this
it
will
be
seen
how
impossible
it
was
for
a
lay
king
like
the
sovereign
ruling
at
tanis
to
submit
to
such
restraints
beyond
a
certain
point
his
patience
would
soon
have
become
exhausted
want
of
practice
would
have
led
him
to
make
slips
or
omissions
rendering
the
rites
null
and
void
and
the
temporal
affairs
of
his
kingdom
internal
administration
justice
finance
commerce
and
war
made
such
demands
upon
his
time
that
he
was
obliged
as
soon
as
possible
to
find
a
substitute
to
fulfil
his
religious
duties
the
force
of
circumstances
therefore
maintained
the
line
of
theban
high
priests
side
by
side
with
their
sovereigns
the
tanite
kings
they
were
it
is
true
dangerous
rivals
both
on
account
of
the
wealth
of
their
fief
and
of
the
immense
prestige
which
they
enjoyed
in
egypt
ethiopia
and
in
all
the
nomes
devoted
to
the
worship
of
amon
they
were
allied
to
the
elder
branch
of
the
ramessides
and
had
thus
inherited
such
near
rights
to
the
crown
that
smendes
had
not
hesitated
to
concede
to
hrihor
the
cartouches
the
preamble
and
insignia
of
the
pharaoh
including
the
pschent
and
the
iron
helmet
inlaid
with
gold
this
concession
however
had
been
made
as
a
personal
favour
and
extended
only
to
the
lifetime
of
hrihor
without
holding
good
as
a
matter
of
course
for
his
successors
his
son
piônkhi
had
to
confine
himself
to
the
priestly
titles
and
his
grandson
paînotmû
enjoyed
the
kingly
privileges
only
during
part
of
his
life
doubtless
in
consequence
of
his
marriage
with
a
certain
mâkerî
probably
daughter
of
psiûkhânnît
l
the
tanite
king
mâkerî
apparently
died
soon
after
and
the
discovery
of
her
coffin
in
the
at
deîr
reveals
the
fact
of
her
death
in
giving
birth
to
a
little
daughter
who
did
not
survive
her
and
who
rests
in
the
same
coffin
beside
the
mummy
of
her
mother
none
of
the
successors
of
paînotmû
masahirti
manakhpirrî
paînotmû
psiûkhânnît
nsbindîdi
enjoyed
a
similar
distinction
and
if
one
of
them
happened
to
surround
his
name
with
a
cartouche
it
was
done
surreptitiously
without
the
authority
of
the
sovereign
the
only
monument
of
this
prince
as
yet
known
gives
him
merely
the
usual
titles
of
the
high
priest
and
the
inscriptions
of
his
son
paînotmû
style
him
prophet
of
his
name
should
probably
be
read
paîônûkhi
or
piônûkhi
rather
than
pionkhi
or
piânkhi
it
is
not
unlikely
that
some
of
the
papyri
published
by
spiegelberg
date
from
his
pontificate
manakhpirrî
often
places
his
name
in
a
square
cartouche
which
tends
at
times
to
become
an
oval
but
this
is
the
case
only
on
some
pieces
of
stuff
rolled
round
a
mummy
and
on
some
bricks
concealed
in
the
walls
of
thebes
and
gebeleîn
if
the
high
priest
of
amon
who
once
to
our
knowledge
enclosed
his
name
in
a
cartouche
is
really
a
high
priest
and
not
a
king
his
case
would
be
analogous
to
that
of
manakhpirrî
paînotmû
ii
contented
himself
with
drawing
attention
to
his
connection
with
the
reigning
house
and
styled
himself
son
of

account
of
his
ancestress
mâkerî
having
been
the
daughter
of
the
pharaoh
psiûkhânnît
the
example
of
the
sons
of
explains
the
variant
which
makes
son
of
manakhpirrî
into
royal
son
of
the
relationship
of
which
he
boasted
was
a
distant
one
but
many
of
his
contemporaries
who
claimed
to
be
of
the
line
of
sesostris
and
called
themselves
sons
of
ramses
traced
their
descent
from
a

more
remote
ancestor

the

of

became
more
and
more
impoverished
and
its
population
gradually
dwindled
the
necropolis
suffered
increasingly
from
pillagers
and
the
of
the
kings
were
felt
to
be
in
such
danger

the

protect
them

to

the

they
have
left

that
to
some
extent
they
carried

the

their

the

inserted
his
cartouches
on
two
of
the
obelisks
raised
by
ramses
at
heliopolis
but
these
were
only
minor
undertakings
and
it
is
at
tanis
that
we
must
seek
the
most
characteristic
examples
of
their
activity
here
it
was
that
psiûkhânnît
rebuilt
the
brick
ramparts
which
defended
the
city
and
decorated
several
of
the
halls
of
the

small

which
he
concealed

the
appropriation
of

which
we

under
former

was
also
practised
by
the
tanites
siamon

as
unscrupulously
as
apôphis
and
the
hyksôs
had
done
before
him
the
tanite
sovereigns
however
were
not
at
a
loss
for
artists
and
they
had
revived
after
the
lapse
of
centuries
the
traditions
of
the
local
school
which
had
flourished
during
the
xiith
dynasty

the

has
notwithstanding
succeeded
in
carving

a
skill

the

the

the

precision

he
has
reproduced
the
severity
of
expression
the
firm
mouth
the
projecting
the
long

of

he
has
not
been
able

his

has
a
certain
hardness
and
conventionality
which
we
never
see
to
the

extent
in
the

of
the
xiith

the
work
is
however
an
extremely
interesting
one
and
we
are
tempted
to
wish
that
many
more
such

had
been
saved
from

dedicated

a
great

like
most
of
his
predecessors
with
similar
tastes
somewhat
of
a
conqueror
the
sovereigns
of
the
xxist
dynasty
though
they
never
undertook
any
distant
campaigns
did
not
neglect
to
keep
up
a
kind
of
suzerainty
over
the
philistine
shephelah
to
which
they
still
laid
claim
the
expedition
which
one
of
them
probably
psiûkhânnît
led
against
gezer
the
alliance
with
the
hebrews
and
the
marriage
of
a
royal
princess
with
solomon
must
all
have
been
regarded
at
the
court
of
tanis
as
a
partial
revival
of
the
former
egyptian
rule
in
syria
the
kings
were
however
obliged
to
rest
content
with
small
results
for
though
their
battalions
were
sufficiently
numerous
and
well
disciplined
to
overcome
the
canaanite
chiefs
or
even
the
israelite
kingdom
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
they
were
strong
enough
to
attack
the
troops
of
the
aramæan
or
hittite
princes
who
had
a
highly
organised
military
system
modelled
on
that
of
assyria
egyptian
arms
and
tactics
had
not
made
much
progress
since
the
great
campaigns
of
the
theban
conquerors
the
military
authorities
still
complacently
trusted
to
their
chariots
and
their
light
troops
of
archers
at
a
period
when
the
whole
success
of
a
campaign
was
decided
by
heavily
armed
infantry
and
when
cavalry
had
already
begun
to
change
the
issue
of
battles
the
decadence
of
the
military
spirit
in
egypt
had
been
particularly
marked
in
all
classes
under
the
later
ramessides
and
the
native
militia
without
exception
was
reduced
to
a
mere
rabble
courageous
it
is
true
and
able
to
sell
their
lives
dearly
when
occasion
demanded
rather
than
give
way
before
the
enemy
but
entirely
lacking
that
enthusiasm
and
resolution
which
sweep
all
obstacles
before
them
the
chariotry
had
not
degenerated
in
the
same
way
thanks
to
the
care
with
which
the
pharaoh
and
his
vassals
kept
up
the
breeding
of
suitable
horses
in
the
training
stables
of
the
principal
towns
egypt
provided
solomon
with
and
with
strong
yet
light
chariots
which
he
sold
with
advantage
to
the
sovereigns
of
the
orontes
and
the
euphrates
but
it
was
the
mercenaries
who
constituted
the
most
active
and
effective
section
of
the
pharaonic
armies
these
troops
formed
the
backbone
on
which
all
the
other
elements
chariots
spearmen
and
native
archers
were
dependent
their
spirited
attack
carried
the
other
troops
with
them
and
by
a
tremendous
onslaught
on
the
enemy
at
a
decisive
moment
gave
the
commanding
general
some
chance
of
success
against
the
and
battalions
that
he
would
be
sure
to
meet
with
on
the
plains
of
asia
the
tanite
kings
enrolled
these
mercenaries
in
large
numbers
they
entrusted
them
with
the
garrisoning
of
the
principal
towns
and
confirmed
the
privileges
which
their
chiefs
had
received
from
the
ramessides
but
the
results
of
such
a
policy
were
not
long
in
manifesting
themselves
and
this
state
of
affairs
had
been
barely
a
century
in
existence
before
egypt
became
a
prey
to
the
barbarians
it
would
perhaps
be
more
correct
to
say
that
it
had
fallen
a
prey
to
the
libyans

that

a
still
more
brilliant
career

learn
from
the

of

that
even
before
he
had
ascended
the

he
was
recognised
as
king
and
prince

had
conferred
on
him
the
command
of
all
the
libyan

officially
he
was
the

exclusively
to

priest
the
honours
which
he
bestowed
upon
his
dead

were
of
a
remarkable
character
and
included
the
institution
of
a
liturgical
office
in
connection
with

work

resembles
in
its

he
obtained

would
be
the
date
of

am
inclined
to
believe

if

a
preponderating

aûpûti

the

all
that
we
know
of
the
relations

jerusalem

at
the

seem
to
indicate
that
the
hebrews
themselves
acknowledged
some
sort
of
dependency
upon

they
were
not
however
on
this
account
free
from
suspicion
in

to

in

lifetime
of

and
the

jeroboam
saw
that
he
was
threatened
by

he
naturally
turned
to
his
old

sheshonq
had
two
problems
before
him
should
he
confirm
by

intervention
the
division
of
the
kingdom
which
had
flourished
in
kharû
for
now
half
a
century
into
two
rival
states
or
should
he
himself
give

to
the
vulgar
appetite

interest
he
invaded

four
years
after

where
an
episode
not
in

the
prophet
shemaiah
played
an
important
part
in
the
transaction
this
expedition
of
the
pharaoh
was
neither
dangerous
nor
protracted
but
it
was
more
than
two
hundred
years
since
so
much
riches
from
countries
beyond
the
isthmus
had
been
brought
into
egypt
and
the
king
was
consequently
regarded
by
the
whole
people
of
the
nile
valley
as
a
great
hero
aûpûti
took
upon
himself
the
task
of
recording
the
exploit
on
the
south
wall
of
the
temple
of
amon
at

not
far
from
the
spot
where

is
remarkable
for
the
number
of
the
names
composing
it
in
comparison
with
those
of

it
is
disappointing
and
one
sees
at
a

how
inferior
even
in

the

of
the
crenellated
cartouches
in
which
the

sheshonq
had
thus
the
puerile
satisfaction
of
parading
before
the

subjects
a

of

than
that
of

the
existence
of
the
names
of
certain
israelite
towns
on
the

has
somewhat
astonished
the
majority
of
the
historians
of
israel
renan
declared
that
the
list
must
aside
the
conjecture
that
jeroboam
had
been
the
instigator
of
the
expedition
which
would
certainly
have
been
readily
admissible
especially
if
any
force
were
attached
to
the
greek
text
of
kings
xii
which
makes
jeroboam
to
have
been
a
of
the
king
of
egypt
the
same
view
had
been
already
expressed
by
stade
others
have
thought
that
sheshonq
had
conquered
the
country
for
his
ally
jeroboam
sheshonq
in
fact
was
following
the
egyptian
custom
by
which
all
countries
and
towns
which
paid
tribute
to
the
pharaoh
or
who
recognised
his
suzerainty
were
made
to
or
might
figure
on
his
triumphal
lists
whether
they
had
been
conquered
or
not
the
presence
of
megiddo
or
mahanaim
on
the
lists
does
not
prove
that
they
were
by
sheshonq
but
that
the
prince
to
whom
they
owed
allegiance
was
a
tributary
to
the
king
of
egypt
the
name
of
melek
which
occupies
the
place
on
the
list
was
for
a
long
time
translated
as
king
or
kingdom
of
judah
and
passed
for
being
a
portrait
of
rehoboam
which
is
impossible
the
hebrew
name
was
read
by
max
millier
the
hand
the
fort
of
the
king
it
appears
to
me
to
be
more
easy
to
see
in
it
and
to
associate
it
with
jehudah
a
town
of
the
tribe
of
dan
as
brugsch
did
long
ago
champollion
identified
osorkon
with
the
zerah
who
according
to
chron
xiv
xvi
invaded
judah
and
was
defeated
by
asa
but
this
has
no
historic
value
for
it
is
clear
that
osorkon
never
crossed
the
isthmus
it
does
not
appear
however
that
either
the
philistines
or
judah
or
israel
or
any
of
the
petty
tribes
which
had
momentarily
gravitated
around
david
and
solomon
were
disposed
to
dispute
claim
theoretic
rather
than
real
as
it
was
the
sword
of
the
stranger
had
finished
the
work
which
the
intestine
quarrel
of
the
tribes
had
begun
if
rehoboam
had
ever
formed
the
project
of
welding
together
the
disintegrated
elements
of
israel
the
taking
of
jerusalem
must
have
been
a
to
his
hopes
his
arsenals
were
empty
his
treasury
at
low
ebb
and
the
prestige
purchased
by
victories
was
effaced
by
the
humiliation
of
his
own
defeat
the
ease
with
which
the
edifice
so
laboriously
constructed
by
the
heroes
of
benjamin
and
judah
had
been
overturned
at
the
first
shock
was
a
proof
that
the
new
possessors
of
canaan
were
as
little
capable
of
barring
the
way
to
egypt
in
her
old
age
as
their
predecessors
had
been
when
she
was
in
her
youth
and
vigour
the
philistines
had
had
their
day
it
seemed
by
no
means
improbable
at
one
time
that
they
were
about
to
sweep
everything
before
them
from
the
negeb
to
the
orontes
but
their
peculiar
position
in
the
furthest
angle
of
the
country
and
their
numerical
weakness
prevented
them
from
continuing
their
efforts
for
a
prolonged
period
and
they
were
at
length
obliged
to
renounce
in
favour
of
the
hebrews
their
ambitious
pretensions
the
latter
who
had
been
making
steady
progress
for
some
half
a
century
had
been
successful
where
the
philistines
had
signally
failed
and
southern
syria
recognised
their
supremacy
for
the
space
of
two
generations
we
can
only
conjecture
what
they
might
have
done
if
a
second
david
had
led
them
into
the
valleys
of
the
orontes
and
euphrates
they
were
stronger
in
numbers
than
their
possible
opponents
and
their
troops
strengthened
by
mercenary
guards
would
have
perhaps
triumphed
over
the
more
skilled
but
fewer
warriors
which
the
amorite
and
aramaean
cities
could
throw
into
the
field
against
them
the
pacific
reign
of
solomon
the
schism
among
the
tribes
and
the
egyptian
invasion
furnished
evidence
enough
that
they
also
were
not
destined
to
realise
that
solidarity
which
alone
could
secure
them
against
the
great
oriental
empires
when
the
day
of
attack
came
the
two
kingdoms
were
then
enjoying
an
independent
existence
judah
in
spite
of
its
smaller
numbers
and
its
recent
disaster
was
not
far
behind
the
more
extensive
israel
in
its
resources
david
and
afterwards
solomon
had
so
kneaded
together
the
various
elements
of
which
it
was
composed
caleb
cain
jerahmeel
and
the
judsean
clans
that
they
had
become
a
homogeneous
mass
grouped
around
the
capital
and
its
splendid
sanctuary
and
actuated
with
feelings
of
profound
admiration
and
strong
fidelity
for
the
family
which
had
made
them
what
they
were
misfortune
had
not
chilled
their
zeal
they
rallied
round
rehoboam
and
his
race
with
such
a
persistency
that
they
were
enabled
to
maintain
their
ground
when
their
richer
rivals
had
squandered
their
energies
and
fallen
away
before
their
eyes
jeroboam
indeed
and
his
successors
had
never
obtained
from
their
people
more
than
a
precarious
support
and
a
lukewarm
devotion
their
authority
was
continually
coming
into
conflict
with
a
tendency
to
disintegration
among
the
tribes
and
they
could
only
maintain
their
rule
by
the
constant
employment
of
force
jeroboam
had
collected
together
from
the
garrisons
scattered
throughout
the
country
the
nucleus
of
an
army
and
had
stationed
the
strongest
of
these
troops
in
his
residence
at
tirzah
when
he
did
not
require
them
for
some
expedition
against
judah
or
the
philistines
his
successors
followed
his
example
in
this
respect
but
this
military
resource
was
only
an
ineffectual
protection
against
the
dangers
which
beset
them
the
kings
were
literally
at
the
mercy
of
their
guard
and
their
reign
was
entirely
dependent
on
its
loyalty
or
caprice
any
unscrupulous
upstart
might
succeed
in
suborning
his
comrades
and
the
stroke
of
a
dagger
might
at
any
moment
send
the
sovereign
to
join
his
ancestors
while
the
successful
rebel
reigned
in
his
stead
the
egyptian
troops
had
no
sooner
set
out
on
their
homeward
march
than
the
two
kingdoms
began
to
display
their
respective
characteristics
an
implacable
and
truceless
war
broke
out
between
them
the
frontier
garrisons
of
the
two
nations
fought
with
each
other
from
one
end
to
another
carrying
off
each
cattle
massacring
one
another
burning
each
villages
and
leading
their
inhabitants
into
slavery
among
nineteen
kings
of

this
is
what
is
meant
by
the
hebrew
historians
when
they
say
was
war
between
rehoboam
and
jeroboam

the
days
of

from

the
situation
became
intolerable
one
of
the

took
the
field
in
person
and
began
operations
by
attacking
such
of
his
strongholds
as
gave
him
the
most
trouble
at
the
time
ramah
acquired
an
unenviable
reputation
in
the
course
of
these
early
conflicts
its
position
gave
it
command
of
the
roads
terminating
in
jerusalem
and
when
it
fell
into
the
hands
of
israel
the
judæan
capital
was
blockaded
on
this
side
the
strife
for
its
possession
was
always
of
a
terrible
character
and
the
party
which
succeeded
in
establishing
itself
firmly
within
it
was
deemed
to
have
obtained
a
great
success
the
campaign
of
abijah
at
mount
zemaraim

in
which
the
foundation
of

narrative

fully
historical

also
the

cf

the
encounter
of
the
armies
did
not
however
seem
to
produce
much
more
serious
results
than
those
which
followed
the
continual
guerilla
warfare
along
the
frontier
the
conqueror
had
no
sooner
defeated
his
enemy
than
he
set
to
work
to
pillage
the
country
in
the
vicinity
and
having
accomplished
this
returned
promptly
to
his
headquarters
with
the
booty
rehoboam
who
had
seen
something
of
the
magnificence
of
solomon
tried
to
perpetuate
the
tradition
of
it
in
his
court
as
far
as
his
slender
revenues
would
permit
him
he
had
eighteen
women
in
his
harem
among
whom
figured
some
of
his

cousins
the
titular
queen
was
maacah
who
was
represented
as
a
daughter
of
absalom
she
was
devoted
to
the
and
the
king
was
not
behind
his
father
in
his
tolerance
of
strange
gods
the
high
places
continued
to
be
tolerated
by
him
as
sites
of
worship
and
even
jerusalem
was
not
free
from
manifestations
of
such
idolatry
as
was
associated
with
the
old
canaanite
religion

matters
did
not
go
so
smoothly
when
jeroboam
after
a
reign
of
years
was
succeeded
by
his
son
nadab
about
the
year
it
was
soon
evident
that
the
instinct
of
loyalty
to
a
particular
dynasty
had
not
yet
laid
any
firm
hold
on
the
ten
tribes
the
peace
between
the
philistines
and
israel
was
quite
as
unstable
as
that
between
israel
and
judah
an
endless
guerilla
warfare
was
waged
on
the
frontier
gibbethon
being
made
to
play
much
the
same
part
in
this
region
as
ramah
had
done
in
regard
to
jerusalem
for
the
moment
it
was
in
the
hands
of
the
philistines
and
in
the
second
year
of
his
reign
nadab
had
gone
to
lay
siege
to

was
assassinated
in

of

the
booh

however
sedulously
in
the
background
while
the
princes

qodshû
waged
war
against

undismayed
by

damascus
did
not
scruple
to
pay
tribute
to

to
enter
into

relations
with
them

been
overthrown

soon

more

the

made
themselves
masters
of

in

been
restored
from

we
have
seen
how
the
aramæans
alarmed
at
the
sudden
rise
of
the
hebrew
dynasty
entered
into
a
coalition
against

as

supremacy
was
however
shortlived

after

chief
named

to
free
them
from

yoke
of

stranger

had
begun
his
military
career
under
king
of

when
disaster
overtook
this
leader
and
released
him
from
his
allegiance
he
collected
an
armed
force
and
fought
for
his
own
hand
a
lucky
stroke
made
him
master
of
damascus
he
proclaimed
himself
king
there
harassed
the
israelites
with
impunity
during
the
reign
of
solomon
and
took
over
the
possessions
of
the
kings
of
zoba
in
the
valleys
of

litany
and
the

the
rupture
between
the
houses
of
israel

removed
the
only
dangerous
rival
from
his
path
and
damascus
became
the
paramount
power
in

judah
and
israel
wasted
their
strength
in
fratricidal
struggles

extended
their
territory
in

conquered

his

thus
arisen
in

and

swept
away
by
revolutionary
outbursts
while
at

the
descendants
of

followed
one
another
in
unbroken
succession
asa
outlived
nadab
by
eleven
years
and
we
hear
nothing
of
his
relations
with
the
neighbouring
states
during
the
latter
part
of
his
reign
we
are
merely
told
that
his
zeal
in
the
service
of
the
lord
was
greater
than
had
been
shown
by
any
of
his
predecessors
he
threw
down
the
idols
expelled
their
priests
and
persecuted
all
those
who
practised
the
ancient
religions
his
grandmother
maacah
made
an
abominable
image
for
an
asherah
he
cut
it
down
and
burnt
it
in
the
valley
of
the
kedron
and
deposed
her
from
the
supremacy
in
the
royal
household
which
she
had
held
for
three
generations
he
is
therefore
the
first
of
the
kings
to
receive
favourable
mention
from
the
orthodox
chroniclers
of
later
times
and
it
is
stated
that
he
that
which
was
right
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
as
did
david
his
omri
proved
a
warlike
monarch
and
his
reign
though
not
a
long
one
was
signalised
by
a
decisive
crisis
in
the
fortunes
of
israel
the
northern
tribes
had
so
far
possessed
no
settled
capital
shechem
penuel
and
tirzah
having
served
in
turn
as
residences
for
the
successors
of
jeroboam
and
baasha
latterly
tirzah
had
been
accorded
a
preference
over
its
rivals
but
zimri
had
burnt
the
castle
there
and
the
ease
with
which
it
had
been
taken
and
retaken
was
not
calculated
to
reassure
the
head
of
the
new
dynasty
omri
turned
his
attention
to
a
site
lying
a
little
to
the
of
shechem
and
mount
ebal
and
at
that
time
partly
covered
by
the
hamlet
of
shomerôn
or
shimrôn
our
modern
samaria
kings
xv
cf
ohron

it
is
admitted
however
though
without
any
blame
being
attached
to
him
that
high
places
were
not
taken
kings
xv
cf
chron
xv
the
hebrew
writer
gives
the
length
of
his
reign
as
twelve
years
kings

several
historians
consider
this
period
too
brief
and
wish
to
extend
it
to
years
i
can
not
however
see
that
there
is
so
far
any
good
reason
for
doubting
the
approximate
accuracy
of
the
bible
figures
according
to
the
tradition
preserved
in
kings
xvi
the
name
of
the
city
comes
from
shomer
the
man
from
whom
ahab
bought
the
site
his
choice
was
a
wise
and
judicious
one
as
the
rapid
development
of
the
city
soon
proved
it
lay
on
the
brow
of
a
rounded
hill
which
rose
in
the
centre
of
a
wide
and
deep
depression
and
was
connected
by
a
narrow
ridge
with
the
surrounding
mountains
the
valley
round
it
is
fertile
and
well
watered
and
the
mountains
are
cultivated
up
to
their
summits
throughout
the
whole
of
ephraim
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
a
site
which
could
compare
with
it
in
strength
or
attractiveness
omri
surrounded
his
city
with
substantial
ramparts
he
built
a
palace
for
himself
and
a
temple
in
which
was
enthroned
a
golden
calf
similar
to
those
at
dan
and
bethel
a
population
drawn
from
other
nations
besides
the
israelites
flocked
into
this
stronghold
and
samaria
soon
came
to
be
for
israel
what
jerusalem
already
was
for
judah
an
almost
impregnable
fortress
in
which
the
sovereign
entrenched
himself
and
round
which
the
nation
could
rally
in
times
of
danger
his
contemporaries
fully
realised
the
importance
of
this
move
on
part
his
name
became
inseparably
connected
in
their
minds
with
that
of

hebrews
made
its

in

the

was
not

for

exercised

the
four

assassinated

managed

cling

and
brutal

most
disastrous
results

emigrated
to

across

sea
and
incited
them
to
rebellion
had
this
state
of
things
lasted
for
any
time
the
tyrian
empire
would
have
been
doomed
a
revolution
led
to
the
removal
of
the
usurper
and
the
restoration
of
the
former
dynasty
but
did
not
bring
back
to
the
unfortunate
city
the
tranquillity
which
it
sorely
needed
the
three
surviving
sons
of
baalbezer
methuastarfc
astarym
and
phelles
followed
one
another
on
the
throne
in
rapid
succession
the
perishing
by
the
hand
of
his
cousin
ethbaal
after
a
reign
of
eight
months
so
far
the
israelites
had
not
attempted
to
take
advantage
of
these
dissensions
but
there
was
always
the
danger
lest
one
of
their
kings
less
absorbed
than
his
predecessors
in
the
struggle
with
judah
might
be
tempted
by
the
wealth
of
phoenicia
to
lay
hands
on
it
ethbaal
therefore
eagerly
accepted
the
means
of
averting
this
danger
by
an
alliance
with
the
new
dynasty
offered
to
him
by
omri
kings
xvi
where
the
historian
has
hebraicised
the
phonician
name
ittobaal
into
is
with
izebel
or
jezebel
seems
to
be
an
abbreviated
form
of
some
name
like
baalezbel
the
presence
of
a
phonician
princess
at
samaria
seems
to
have
had
a
favourable
effect
on
the
city
and
its
inhabitants
the
tribes
of
northern
and
central
palestine
had
so
far
resisted
the
march
of
material
civilization
which
since
the
days
of
solomon
had
carried
judah
along
with
it
they
adhered
as
a
matter
of
principle
to
the
rude
and
simple
customs
of
their
ancestors
jezebel
who
from
her
cradle
had
been
accustomed
to
all
the
luxuries
and
refinements
of
the
phoenician
court
was
by
no
means
prepared
to
dispense
with
them
in
her
adopted
country
by
their
contact
with
her
the
israelites
at
any
rate
the
upper
and
middle
classes
of
them
acquired
a
certain
degree
of
polish
the
royal
office
assumed
a
more
dignified
exterior
and
approached
more
nearly
the
splendours
of
the
other
syrian
monarchies
such
as
those
of
damascus
hamath
sidon
tyre
and
even
judah
unfortunately
the
effect
of
this
material
progress
was
marred
by
a
religious
difficulty
jezebel
had
been
brought
up
by
her
father
the
high
priest
of
the
sidonian
astarte
as
a
rigid
believer
in
his
faith
and
she
begged
ahab
to
permit
her
to
celebrate
openly
the
worship
of
her
national
deities
ere
long
the
tyrian
baal
was
installed
at
samaria
with
his
asherah
and
his
votaries
had
their
temples
and
sacred
groves
to
worship
in
their
priests
and
prophets
sat
at
the
table
ahab
did
not
reject
the
god
of
his
ancestors
in
order
to
embrace
the
religion
of
his
wife
a
reproach
which
was
afterwards
laid
to
his
door
he
remained
faithful
to
him
and
gave
the
children
whom
he
had
by
jezebel
names
compounded
with
that
of
jahveh
such
as
ahaziah
joram
and
athaliah
kings
xvi
ahaziah
and
joram
mean
respectively
jahveh
sustaineth
and
is
athaliah
may
possibly
be
derived
from
a
phoenician
form
or
athlifh
into
which
the
name
of
jahveh
does
not
enter
this
was
not
the
first
instance
of
such
tolerance
in
the
history
of
the
israelites
solomon
had
granted
a
similar
liberty
of
conscience
to
all
his
foreign
wives
and
neither
rehoboam
nor
abijam
had
opposed
maacah
in
her
devotion
to
the
canaanitish
idols
but
the
times
were
changing
and
the
altar
of
baal
could
no
longer
be
placed
side
by
side
with
that
of
jahveh
without
arousing
fierce
anger
and
inexorable
hatred
scarce
a
hundred
years
had
elapsed
since
the
rupture
between
the
tribes
and
already
of
the
people
were
unable
to
understand
how
place
could
be
found
in
the
breast
of
a
true
israelite
for
any
other
god
but
jahveh
jahveh
alone
was
lord
for
none
of
the
deities
worshipped
by
foreign
races
under
human
or
animal
shapes
could
compare
with
him
in
might
and
holiness
from
this
to
the
repudiation
of
all
those
practices
associated
with
exotic
deities
such
as
the
use
of
idols
of
wood
or
metal
the
anointing
of
isolated
boulders
or
circles
of
rocks
the
offering
up
of
prisoners
or
of
the
firstborn
was
but
a
step
asa
had
already
furnished
an
example
of
rigid
devotion
in
judah
and
there
were
many
in
israel
who
shared
his
views
and
desired
to
imitate
him
the
opposition
to
what
was
regarded
as
apostasy
on
the
part
of
the
king
did
not
come
from
the
official
priesthood
the
sanctuaries
at
dan
at
bethel
at
shiloh
and
at
gilgal
were
prosperous
in
spite
of
jezebel
and
this
was
enough
for
them
but
the
influence
of
the
prophets
had
increased
marvellously
since
the
rupture
between
the
kingdoms
and
at
the
very
beginning
of
his
reign
ahab
was
unwise
enough
to
outrage
their
sense
of
justice
by
one
of
his
violent
acts
in
a
transport
of
rage
he
had
slain
a
certain
naboth
who
had
refused
to
let
him
have
his
vineyard
in
order
that
he
might
enlarge
the
grounds
of
the
palace
he
was
building
for
himself
at
jezreel
the
prophets
as
in
former
times
were
divided
into
schools
the
head
of
each
being
called
its
father
the
members
bearing
the
title
of
sons
of
the
prophets
they
dwelt
in
a
sort
of
monastery
each
having
his
own
cell
where
they
ate
together
performed
their
devotional
exercises
or
assembled
to
listen
to
the
exhortations
of
their
chief
prophets
nor
did
their
sacred
office
prevent
them
from
marrying
kings
where
the
later
tradition
throws
nearly
all
the
blame
on
jezebel
whereas
in
the
shorter
account
in
kings
ix
it
is
laid
entirely
on
ahab
in
sam
xix
a
passage
which
seems
to
some
to
be
a
later
interpolation
mentions
a
of
the
prophets
prophesying
and
samuel
standing
as
head
over
cf
kings
vi
where
the
narrative
introduces
a
congregation
of
prophets
grouped
round
elisha
kings
iv
where
an
account
is
given
of
the
miracle
worked
by
elisha
on
behalf
of
woman
of
the
wives
of
the
sons
of
the
as
a
rule
they
settled
near
one
of
the
temples
and
lived
there
on
excellent
terms
with
the
members
of
the
regular
priesthood
accompanied
by
musical
instruments
they
chanted
the
songs
in
which
the
poets
of
other
days
extolled
the
mighty
deeds
of
jahveh
and
obtained
from
this
source
the
incidents
of
the
accounts
which
they
narrated
concerning
the
early
history
of
the
people
or
when
the
spirit
moved
them
they
went
about
through
the
land
prophesying
either
singly
or
accompanied
by
a
disciple
or
in
bands
the
people
thronged
round
them
to
listen
to
their
hymns
or
their
stories
of
the
heroic
age
the
great
ones
of
the
land
even
kings
themselves
received
visits
from
them
and
endured
their
reproaches
or
exhortations
with
mingled
feelings
of
awe
and
terror
a
few
of
the
prophets
took
the
part
of
ahab
and
jezebel
but
the
majority
declared
against
them
and
of
these
the
most
conspicuous
by
his
forcibleness
of
speech
and
action
was
elijah
we
do
not
know
of
what
race
or
family
he
came
nor
even
what
he
was
the
incidents
of
his
life
which
have
come
down
to
us
seem
to
be
wrapped
in
a
vague
legendary
grandeur
he
appears
before
ahab
and
tells
him
that
for
years
to
come
no
rain
or
dew
shall
fall
on
the
earth
save
by
his
command
and
then
takes
flight
into
the
desert
in
order
to
escape
the
anger
sam
x
where
a
band
of
prophets
is
mentioned
down
from
the
high
place
with
a
psaltery
and
a

and
a
pipe
and
a
harp
before
them
prophesying
cf

in

bands
of
the
of

come
out
from
bethel
and
jericho
to
ask
elisha
if
he
knows
the
fate
which
awaits
elijah
on
that
very
day
cf
the
anonymous
prophet
who
encourages
ahab
in
the
name
of
jahveh
to
surprise
the
camp
of
benhadad
before
samaria
kings
xx
and
the
prophet
zedekiah
who
gives
advice
contrary
to
that
of
his
prophet
micaiah
in
the
council
of
war
held
by
ahab
with
jehoshaphat
king
of
judah
before
the
attack
on
gilead
kings
xxii
the
ethnical
inscription
which
we
find
after
his
name
kings
xvii
xxi
is
due
to
an
error
on
the
part
of
the
copyist
he
is
there
ministered
unto
by
ravens
which
bring
him
bread
and
meat
every
night
and
morning
when
the
spring
from
which
he
drinks
dries
up
he
goes
to
the
house
of
a
widow
at
zarephath
in
the
country
of
sidon
and
there
he
lives
with
his
hostess
for
twelve
months
on
a
barrel
of
meal
and
a
cruse
of
oil
which
never
fail
the
son
dies
suddenly
he
prays
to
jahveh
and
restores
him
to
life
then
still
guided
by
an
inspiration
from
above
he
again
presents
himself
before
the
king
ahab
receives
him
without
resentment
assembles
the
prophets
of
baal
brings
them
face
to
face
with
elijah
on
the
top
of
mount
carmel
and
orders
them
to
put
an
end
to
the
drought
by
which
his
kingdom
is
wasted
the
phoenicians
erect
an
altar
and
call
upon
their
baâlîm
with
loud
cries
and
gash
their
arms
and
bodies
with
knives
yet
can
not
bring
about
the
miracle
expected
of
them
elijah
after
mocking
at
their
cries
and
contortions
at
last
addresses
a
prayer
to
jahveh
and
fire
comes
down
from
heaven
and
consumes
the
sacrifice
in
a
moment
the
people
convinced
by
the
miracle
fall
upon
the
idolaters
and
massacre
them
and
the
rain
shortly
afterwards
falls
in
torrents
after
this
triumph
he
is
said
to
have
fled
once
more
for
safety
to
the
desert
and
there
on
horeb
to
have
had
a
divine
vision
behold
the
lord
passed
by
and
a
great
and
strong
wind
rent
the
mountains
and
brake
in
pieces
the
rocks
before
the
lord
but
the
lord
was
not
in
the
wind
and
after
the
wind
an
earthquake
but
the
lord
was
not
in
the
earthquake
and
after
the
earthquake
a
fire
but
the
lord
was
not
in
the
fire
and
after
the
fire
a
still
small
voice
and
it
was
so
when
elijah
heard
it
that
he
wrapped
his
face
in
his
mantle
and
went
out
and
stood
in
the
entering
in
of
the
cave
and
behold
there
came
a
voice
unto
him
and
said
doest
thou
here
elijah
god
then
commanded
him
to
anoint
hazael
as
king
of
syria
and
jehu
son
of
nimshi
as
king
over
israel
and
elisha
son
of
shaphat
as
prophet
in
his
stead
him
that
escapeth
from
the
sword
of
hazael
shall
jehu
slay
and
him
that
escapeth
from
the
sword
of
jehu
shall
elisha
the
sacred
writings
go
on
to
tell
us
that
the
prophet
who
had
held
such
close
converse
with
the
deity
was
exempt
from
the
ordinary
laws
of
humanity
and
was
carried
to
heaven
in
a
chariot
of
fire
the
account
that
has
come
down
to
us
shows
the
impression
of
awe
left
by
elijah
on
the
spirit
of
his
age
ahab
was
one
of
the
most
warlike
among
the
of
israel
he
ruled
moab
with
a
strong
hand
kept
judah
in
subjection
and
in
his
conflict
with
damascus
experienced
alternately
victory
and
honourable
defeat

the
hebrew
historians
make

succeeded

conqueror

of

found
in

xxi

of

the
subordination
of

nowhere
explicitly
mentioned
it
is
inferred
from

adopted
by

in
presence
of
ahab
kings
xxii

the
assyrian
texts
call
this
dadidri
adadidri

corresponds

time

his
first
wars
with

the
siege

ahab
appears
in
at
the
battle
of
karkar
as
the
ally
of
benhadad
as
i
shall
show
later
the
account
of
his
campaigns
in
the
hebrew
records
has
only
reached
us
in
a
seemingly
condensed
and
distorted
condition
israel
strengthened
by
the
exploits
of
omri
must
have
offered
him
a
strenuous
resistance
but
we
know
nothing
of
the
causes
nor
of
the
opening
scenes
of
the
drama
when
the
curtain
is
lifted
the
preliminary
conflict
is
over
and
the
israelites
closely
besieged
in
samaria
have
no
alternative
before
them
but
unconditional
surrender
this
was
the
first
serious
attack
the
city
had
sustained
and
its
resistance
spoke
well
for
the
military
foresight
of
its
founder
in
train
were
kings
and
horses
and
chariots
innumerable
while
his
adversary
could
only
oppose
to
them
seven
thousand
men
ahab
was
willing
to
treat
but
the
conditions
proposed
were
so
outrageous
that
he
broke
off
the
negotiations
we
do
not
know
how
long
the
blockade
had
lasted
when
one
day
the
garrison
made
a
sortie
in
full
daylight
and
fell
upon

syrian
camp

benhadad

escaped

hostilities

following
year

instead
of
engaging
the
enemy
in
the
of
ephraim
where
his
superior
numbers
brought
him
no
advantage
he
deployed
his
lines
on
the
plain
of
jezreel
near
the
town
of
aphek
his
servants
had
counselled
him
to
change
his
tactics
god
of
the
hebrews
is
a
god
of
the
hills
therefore
they
were
stronger
than
we
but
let
us
fight
against
them
in
the
plain
and
surely
we
shall
be
stronger
than
the
advice
however
proved
futile
for
he
sustained
on
the
open
plain
a
still
more
severe
defeat
than
he
had
met
with
in
the
mountains
and
the
hebrew
historians
affirm
that
he
was
taken
prisoner
during
the
pursuit
the
power
of
damascus
was
still
formidable
and
the
captivity
of
its
king
had
done
little
to
bring
the
war
to
an
end
ahab
therefore
did
not
press
his
advantage
but
received
the
syrian
monarch
a
brother
and
set
him
at
liberty
after
concluding
with
him
an
offensive
and
defensive
alliance
israel
at
this
time
recovered
possession
of
some
of
the
cities
which
had
been
lost
under
baasha
and
omri
and
the
israelites
once
more
enjoyed
the
right
to
occupy
a
particular
quarter
of
damascus
according
to
the
hebrew
account
this
was
the
retaliation
they
took
for
their
previous
humiliations
it
is
further
stated
in
relation
to
this
event
that
a
certain
man
of
the
sons
of
the
prophets
speaking
by
the
word
of
the
lord
bade
one
of
his
companions
smite
him
having
received
a
wound
he
disguised
himself
with
a
bandage
over
his
eyes
and
placed
himself
in
the
path
as
the
king
passed
by
he
cried
unto
the
king
and
he
said
thy
servant
went
out
into
the
midst
of
the
battle
and
behold
a
man
turned
aside
and
brought
a
man
unto
me
and
said
keep
this
man
if
by
any
means
he
be
missing
then
shall
thy
life
be
for
his
life
or
else
thou
shalt
pay
a
talent
of
silver
and
as
thy
servant
was
busy
here
and
there
he
was
gone
and
the
king
of
israel
said
unto
him
so
shall
thy
judgment
be
thyself
has
decided
it
then
he
hasted
and
took
the
headband
away
from
his
eyes
and
the
king
of
israel
discerned
him
that
he
was
one
of
the
prophets
and
he
said
unto
him
thus
saith
the
lord
because
thou
hast
let
go
out
of
thy
hand
the
man
whom
i
had
devoted
to
destruction
therefore
thy
life
shall
go
for
his
life
and
thy
people
for
his
people
and
the
king
of
israel
went
to
his
house
heavy
and
displeased
and
came
to
this
story
was
in
accordance
with
the
popular
feeling
and
ahab
certainly
ought
not
to
have
paused
till
he
had
exterminated
his
enemy
could
he
have
done
so
but
was
this
actually
in
his
power
we
have
no
reason
to
contest
the
leading
facts
in
this
account
or
to
doubt
that
benhadad
suffered
some
reverses
before
samaria
but
we
may
perhaps
ask
whether
the
check
was
as
serious
as
we
are
led
to
believe
and
whether
imagination
and
national
vanity
did
not
exaggerate
its
extent
and
results
the
fortresses
of
persea
which
according
to
the
treaty
ought
to
have
been
restored
to
israel
remained
in
the
hands
of
the
people
of
damascus
and
the
loss
of
continued
to
be
a
source
of
vexation
to
such
of
the
tribes
of
gad
and
reuben
as
followed
the
fortunes
of
the
house
of
omri
yet
these
places
formed
the
most
important
part
of
ransom
the
king
of
israel
said
unto
his
servants
know
ye
that
is
ours
and
we
be
still
and
take
it
not
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
syria
the
sole
effect
of
success
was
to
procure
for
him
more
lenient
treatment
he
lost
no
territory
and
perhaps
gained
a
few
towns
but
he
had
to
sign
conditions
of
peace
which
made
him
an
acknowledged
vassal
to
the
king
of
syria
no
document
as
yet
proves
directly
that
ahab
was
vassal
to
benhadad
ii
the
fact
seems
to
follow
clearly
enough
from
the
account
of
the
battle
of
karkar
against
shalmaneser
where
the
contingent
of
ahab
of
israel
figures
among
those
of
the
kings
who
fought
for
benhadad
ii
against
the
assyrians
damascus
still
remained
the
foremost
state
of
syria
and
if
we
rightly
interpret
the
scanty
information
we
possess
seemed
in
a
fair
way
to
bring
about
that
unification
of
the
country
which
neither
hittites
philistines
nor
hebrews
had
been
able
to
effect
situated
nearly
equidistant
from
raphia
and
carchemish
on
the
outskirts
of
the
cultivated
region
the
city
was
protected
in
the
rear
by
the
desert
which
secured
it
from
invasion
on
the
east
and
the
dusty
plains
of
the
haurân
protected
it
on
the
south
and
the
wooded
cliffs
of
on
the
west
and
it
was
entrenched
within
these
natural
barriers
as
in
a
fortress
whence
the
garrison
was
able
to
sally
forth
at
will
to
attack
in
force
one
or
other
of
the
surrounding
nations
if
the
city
were
victorious
its
central
position
made
it
easy
for
its
rulers
to
keep
watch
over
and
preserve
what
they
had
won
if
it
suffered
defeat
the
surrounding
mountains
and
deserts
formed
natural
lines
of
fortification
easy
to
defend
against
the
pursuing
foe
but
very
difficult
for
the
latter
to
force
and
the
delay
presented
by
this
obstacle
gave
the
inhabitants
time
to
organise
their
reserves
and
bring
fresh
troops
into
the
field
the
kings
of
damascus
at
the
outset
brought
under
their
suzerainty
the
aramaean
principalities
argob
maacah
and
geshur
by
which
they
controlled
the
haurân
and
zobah
which
secured
to
them
from
lake
huleh
to
the
bahr
they
had
taken
upper
galilee
from
the
hebrews
and
subsequently
perasa
as
far
as
the
jabbok
and
held
in
check
israel
and
the
smaller
states
amnion
and
moab
which
followed
in
its
wake
they
exacted
tribute
from
hamath
the
phoenician
arvad
the
lower
valley
of
the
orontes
and
from
a
portion
of
the
hittites
and
demanded
contingents
from
their
princes
in
time
of
war
their
power
was
still
in
its
infancy
and
its
elements
were
not
firmly
welded
together
but
the
surrounding
peoples
were
in
such
a
state
of
weakness
and
disunion
that
they
might
be
left
out
of
account
as
formidable
enemies
the
only
danger
that
menaced
the
rising
kingdom
was
the
possibility
that
the
two
ancient
warlike
nations
egypt
and
assyria
might
shake
off
their
torpor
and
reappearing
on
the
scene
of
their
former
prowess
might
attack
her
before
she
had
consolidated
her
power

the
annexation
