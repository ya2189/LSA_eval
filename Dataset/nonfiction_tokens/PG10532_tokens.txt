dante
rise
of
modern
poetry
the
first
great
genius
who
aroused
his
country
from
the
torpor
of
the
middle
ages
was
a
poet
poetry
then
was
the
first
influence
which
elevated
the
human
mind
amid
the
miseries
of
a
gloomy
period
if
we
may
except
the
schools
of
philosophy
which
flourished
in
the
rising
universities
but
poetry
probably
preceded
all
other
forms
of
culture
in
europe
even
as
it
preceded
philosophy
and
art
in
greece
the
gay
provencal
singers
were
harbingers
of
dante
even
as
unknown
poets
prepared
the
way
for
homer
and
as
homer
was
the
creator
of
grecian
literature
so
dante
by
his
immortal
comedy
gave
the
first
great
impulse
to
italian
thought
hence
poets
are
great
benefactors
and
we
will
not
let
them
die
in
our
memories
or
hearts
we
crown
them
when
alive
with
laurels
and
praises
and
when
they
die
we
erect
monuments
to
their
honor
they
are
dear
to
us
since
their
writings
give
perpetual
pleasure
and
appeal
to
our
loftiest
sentiments
they
appeal
not
merely
to
consecrated
ideas
and
feelings
but
they
strive
to
conform
to
the
principles
of
immortal
art
every
great
poet
is
as
much
an
artist
as
the
sculptor
or
the
painter
and
art
survives
learning
itself
varro
the
most
learned
of
the
romans
is
forgotten
when
virgil
is
familiar
to
every
cicero
himself
would
not
have
been
immortal
if
his
essays
and
orations
had
not
conformed
to
the
principles
of
art
even
an
historian
who
would
live
must
be
an
artist
like
voltaire
or
macaulay
a
cumbrous
or
heavy
or
pedantic
historian
will
never
be
read
even
if
his
learning
be
praised
by
all
the
critics
of
germany
poets
are
the
great
artists
of
language
they
even
create
languages
like
homer
and
shakspeare
they
are
the
ornaments
of
literature
but
they
are
more
than
ornaments
they
are
the
sages
whose
sayings
are
treasured
up
and
valued
and
quoted
from
age
to
age
because
of
the
inspiration
which
is
given
to
them
an
insight
into
the
mysteries
of
the
soul
and
the
secrets
of
life
a
good
song
is
never
lost
a
good
poem
is
never
buried
like
a
system
of
philosophy
but
has
an
inherent
vitality
like
the
melodies
of
the
son
of
jesse
real
poetry
is
something
too
beyond
elaborate
versification
which
is
one
of
the
literary
fashions
and
passes
away
like
other
fashions
unless
redeemed
by
something
that
arouses
the
soul
and
elevates
it
and
appeals
to
the
consciousness
of
universal
humanity
it
is
the
poets
who
make
revelations
like
prophets
and
sages
of
old
it
is
they
who
invest
history
with
interest
like
shakspeare
and
racine
and
preserve
what
is
most
vital
and
valuable
in
it
they
even
adorn
philosophy
like
lucretius
when
he
speculated
on
the
systems
of
the
ionian
philosophers
they
certainly
impress
powerfully
on
the
mind
the
truths
of
theology
as
watts
and
cowper
and
wesley
did
in
their
noble
lyrics
so
that
the
most
rapt
and
imaginative
of
men
if
artists
utilize
the
whole
realm
of
knowledge
and
diffuse
it
and
perpetuate
it
in
artistic
forms
but
real
poets
are
rare
even
if
there
are
many
who
glory
in
the
jingle
of
language
and
the
structure
of
rhyme
poetry
to
live
must
have
a
soul
and
it
must
combine
rare
things
art
music
genius
original
thought
wisdom
made
still
richer
by
learning
and
above
all
a
power
of
appealing
to
inner
sentiments
which
all
feel
yet
are
reluctant
to
express
so
choice
are
the
gifts
so
grand
are
the
qualities
so
varied
the
attainments
of
truly
great
poets
that
very
few
are
born
in
a
whole
generation
and
in
nations
that
number
twenty
or
forty
millions
of
people
they
are
the
rarest
of
gifted
men
every
nation
can
boast
of
its
illustrious
lawyers
statesmen
physicians
and
orators
but
they
can
point
only
to
a
few
of
their
poets
with
pride
we
can
count
on
the
fingers
of
one
of
our
hands
all
those
worthy
of
poetic
fame
who
now
live
in
this
great
country
of
intellectual
and
civilized
men
one
for
every
ten
millions
how
great
the
even
of
ordinary
poets
how
very
great
the
of
those
few
whom
all
ages
and
nations
admire
the
critics
assign
to
dante
a
over
most
of
those
we
call
immortal
only
two
or
three
other
poets
in
the
whole
realm
of
literature
ancient
or
modern
dispute
his
throne
we
compare
him
with
homer
and
shakspeare
and

pope
and

all
immortal
artists
but
it
points
to
only
four
men
concerning
whose
transcendent
creative
power
there
is
unanimity
of
judgment
prodigies
of
genius
to
whose
influence
and
fame
we
can
assign
no
limits
stars
of
such
surpassing
brilliancy
that
we
can
only
gaze
and
wonder
growing
brighter
and
brighter
too
with
the
progress
of
ages
so
remarkable
that
no
barbarism
will
ever
obscure
their
brightness
so
original
that
all
imitation
of
them
becomes
impossible
and
absurd
so
great
is
original
genius
directed
by
art
and
consecrated
to
lofty
sentiments
i
have
assumed
the
difficult
task
of
presenting
one
of
these
great
lights
but
i
do
not
presume
to
analyze
his
great
poem
or
to
point
out
critically
its
excellencies
this
would
be
beyond
my
powers
even
if
i
were
an
italian
it
takes
a
poet
to
reveal
a
poet
nor
is
criticism
interesting
to
ordinary
minds
even
in
the
hands
of
masters
i
should
make
critics
laugh
if
i
were
to
attempt
to
dissect
the
divine
comedy
although
in
an
english
dress
it
is
known
to
most
people
who
pretend
to
be
cultivated
yet
it
is
not
more
read
than
the
paradise
lost
or
the
faerie
queene
being
too
deep
and
learned
for
some
and
understood
by
nobody
without
a
tolerable
acquaintance
with
the
middle
ages
which
it
interprets
the
superstitions
the
loves
the
hatreds
the
ideas
of
ages
which
can
never
more
return
all
i
can
do
all
that
is
safe
for
me
to
attempt
is
to
show
the
circumstances
and
conditions
in
which
it
was
written
the
sentiments
which
prompted
it
its
historical
results
its
general
scope
and
end
and
whatever
makes
its
author
stand
out
to
us
as
a
living
man
bearing
the
sorrows
and
revelling
in
the
joys
of
that
high
life
which
gave
to
him
extraordinary
moral
wisdom
and
made
him
a
prophet
and
teacher
to
all
generations
he
was
a
man
of
sorrows
of
resentments
fierce
and
implacable
but
whose
love
was
as
transcendent
as
his
scorn
a
man
of
vast
experiences
and
intense
convictions
and
superhuman
earnestness
despising
the
world
which
he
sought
to
elevate
living
isolated
in
the
midst
of
society
a
wanderer
and
a
sage
meditating
constantly
on
the
grandest
themes
lost
in
ecstatic
reveries
familiar
with
abstruse
theories
versed
in
all
the
wisdom
of
his
day
and
in
the
history
of
the
past
a
believer
in
god
and
immortality
in
rewards
and
punishments
and
perpetually
soaring
to
comprehend
the
mysteries
of
existence
and
those
ennobling
truths
which
constitute
the
joy
and
the
hope
of
renovated
and
emancipated
and
glorified
spirits
in
the
realms
of
eternal
bliss
all
this
is
history
and
it
is
history
alone
which
i
seek
to
teach
the
outward
life
of
a
great
man
with
glimpses
if
i
can
of
those
visions
of
beauty
and
truth
in
which
his
soul
lived
and
which
visions
and
experiences
constitute
his
peculiar
greatness
dante
was
not
so
close
an
observer
of
human
nature
as
shakspeare
nor
so
great
a
painter
of
human
actions
as
homer
nor
so
learned
a
scholar
as
milton
but
his
soul
was
more
serious
than
either
he
was
deeper
more
intense
than
they
while
in
pathos
in
earnestness
and
in
fiery
emphasis
he
has
been
surpassed
only
by
hebrew
poets
and
prophets
it
would
seem
from
his
numerous
biographies
that
he
was
remarkable
from
a
boy
that
he
was
a
youthful
prodigy
that
he
was
precocious
like
cicero
and
pascal
that
he
early
made
great
attainments
giving
utterance
to
living
thoughts
and
feelings
like
bacon
among
boyish
companions
lisping
in
numbers
like
pope
before
he
could
write
prose
different
from
all
other
boys
since
no
time
can
be
fixed
when
he
did
not
think
and
feel
like
a
person
of
maturer
years
born
in
florence
of
the
noble
family
of
the
alighieri
in
the
year
his
early
education
devolved
upon
his
mother
his
father
having
died
while
the
boy
was
very
young
his
mother
friend
brunetto
latini
famous
as
statesman
and
scholarly
poet
was
of
great
assistance
in
directing
his
tastes
and
studies
as
a
mere
youth
he
wrote
sonnets
such
as
sordello
the
troubadour
would
not
disdain
to
own
he
delights
as
a
boy
in
those
inquiries
which
gave
fame
to
bonaventura
he
has
an
intuitive
contempt
for
all
quacks
and
pretenders
at
paris
he
maintains
fourteen
different
theses
propounded
by
learned
men
on
different
subjects
and
gains
universal
admiration
he
is
early
selected
by
his
native
city
for
important
offices
which
he
fills
with
honor
in
wit
he
encounters
no
superiors
he
scorches
courts
by
sarcasms
which
he
can
not
restrain
he
offends
the
great
by
a
superiority
which
he
does
not
attempt
to
veil
he
affects
no
humility
for
his
nature
is
doubtless
proud
he
is
even
offensively
conscious
and
arrogant
when
florence
is
deliberating
about
the
choice
of
an
ambassador
to
rome
he
playfully
yet
still
arrogantly
exclaims
if
i
remain
behind
who
goes
and
if
i
go
who
remains
behind
his
countenance
so
austere
and
thoughtful
impresses
all
beholders
with
a
sort
of
inborn
greatness
his
lip
in
portrait
is
curled
disdainfully
as
if
he
lived
among
fools
or
knaves
he
is
given
to
no
youthful
excesses
he
lives
simply
and
frugally
he
rarely
speaks
unless
spoken
to
he
is
absorbed
apparently
in
thought
without
a
commanding
physical
person
he
is
a
marked
man
to
everybody
even
when
he
deems
himself
a
stranger
women
gaze
at
him
with
wonder
and
admiration
though
he
disdains
their
praises
and
avoids
their
flatteries
men
make
way
for
him
as
he
passes
them
unconsciously
behold
said
a
group
of
ladies
as
he
walked
slowly
by
them
there
is
a
man
who
has
visited
hell
to
the
close
of
his
life
he
was
a
great
devourer
of
books
and
digested
their
contents
his
studies
were
as
various
as
they
were
profound
he
was
familiar
with
the
ancient
poets
and
historians
and
philosophers
he
was
still
better
acquainted
with
the
abstruse
speculations
of
the
schoolmen
he
delighted
in
universities
and
scholastic
retreats
from
the
cares
and
duties
of
public
life
he
would
retire
to
solitary
labors
and
dignify
his
retirement
by
improving
studies
he
did
not
live
in
a
cell
like
jerome
or
a
cave
like
mohammed
but
no
man
was
ever
more
indebted
to
solitude
and
meditation
than
he
for
that
insight
and
inspiration
which
communion
with
god
and
great
ideas
alone
can
give
and
yet
though
a
recluse
and
student
he
had
great
experiences
with
life
he
was
born
among
the
higher
ranks
of
society
he
inherited
an
ample
patrimony
he
did
not
shrink
from
public
affairs
he
was
intensely
patriotic
like
michael
angelo
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
good
of
his
country
like
savonarola
florence
was
small
but
it
was
important
it
was
already
a
capital
and
a
centre
of
industry
he
represented
its
interests
in
various
courts
he
lived
with
princes
and
nobles
he
took
an
active
part
in
all
public
matters
and
disputations
he
was
even
familiar
with
the
intrigues
of
parties
he
was
a
politician
as
well
as
scholar
he
entered
into
the
contests
between
popes
and
emperors
respecting
the
independence
of
italy
he
was
not
conversant
with
art
for
the
great
sculptors
and
painters
had
not
then
arisen
the
age
was
still
dark
the
mariner
compass
had
not
been
invented
chimneys
had
not
been
introduced
the
comforts
of
life
were
few
dames
of
highest
rank
still
spent
their
days
over
the
distaff
or
in
combing
flax
there
were
no
grand
structures
but
cathedral
churches
life
was
laborious
dismal
and
turbulent
law
and
order
did
not
reign
in
cities
or
villages
the
poor
were
oppressed
by
nobles
commerce
was
small
and
manufactures
scarce
men
lived
in
dreary
houses
without
luxuries
on
coarse
bread
and
fruit
and
vegetables
the
crusades
had
not
come
to
an
end
it
was
the
age
of
bad
popes
and
quarrelsome
nobles
and
lazy
monks
and
haughty
bishops
and
ignorant
people
steeped
in
gloomy
superstitions
two
hundred
years
before
america
was
discovered
and
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
before
michael
angelo
erected
the
dome
of
peter
but
there
was
faith
in
the
world
and
rough
virtues
sincerity
and
earnestness
of
character
though
life
was
dismal
men
believed
in
immortality
and
in
expiation
for
sin
the
rising
universities
had
gifted
scholars
whose
abstruse
speculations
have
never
been
rivalled
for
acuteness
and
severity
of
logic
there
were
bards
and
minstrels
and
chivalric
knights
and
tournaments
and
tilts
and
village
and
hospitable
convents
and
gentle
ladies
gentle
and
lovely
even
in
all
states
of
civilization
winning
by
their
graces
and
inspiring
men
to
deeds
of
heroism
and
gallantry
in
one
of
those
domestic
revolutions
which
were
so
common
in
italy
dante
was
banished
and
his
property
was
confiscated
and
he
at
the
age
of
about
the
year
when
giotto
was
painting
portraits
was
sent
forth
a
wanderer
and
an
exile
now
poor
and
unimportant
to
eat
the
bread
of
strangers
and
climb
other
people
stairs
and
so
obnoxious
was
he
to
the
dominant
party
in
his
native
city
for
his
bitter
spirit
that
he
was
destined
never
to
return
to
his
home
and
friends
his
ancestors
boasting
of
roman
descent
belonged
to
the
patriotic
party
the
guelphs
who
had
the
ascendency
in
his
early
years
that
party
which
defended
the
claims
of
the
popes
against
the
emperors
of
germany
but
this
party
had
its
divisions
and
rival
families
those
that
sided
with
the
old
feudal
nobles
who
had
once
ruled
the
city
and
the
new
mercantile
families
that
surpassed
them
in
wealth
and
popular
favor
so
expelled
by
a
fraction
of
his
own
party
that
had
gained
power
dante
went
over
to
the
ghibellines
and
became
an
adherent
of
imperial
authority
until
he
died
it
was
in
his
wanderings
from
court
to
court
and
castle
to
castle
and
convent
to
convent
and
university
to
university
that
he
acquired
that
profound
experience
with
men
and
the
world
which
fitted
him
for
his
great
task
not
as
victorious
knight
on
the
field
of
campaldino
not
as
leader
of
the
guelph
aristocracy
at
florence
not
as
prior
not
as
ambassador
but
as
a
wanderer
did
he
acquire
his
moral
wisdom
he
was
a
striking
example
of
the
severe
experiences
to
which
nearly
all
great
benefactors
have
been
subjected
abraham
the
exile
in
the
wilderness
in
egypt
among
philistines
among
robbers
and
barbaric
chieftains
the
prince
siddârtha
who
founded
buddhism
in
his
wanderings
among
the
various
indian
nations
who
bowed
down
to
brahma
and
still
greater
the
apostle
paul
in
his
protracted
martyrdom
among
pagan
idolaters
and
boastful
philosophers
in
asia
and
in
europe
these
and
others
may
be
cited
who
led
a
life
of
and
reproach
in
order
to
spread
the
truths
which
save
mankind
we
naturally
call
their
lot
hard
even
though
they
chose
it
but
it
is
the
school
of
greatness
it
was
sad
to
see
the
wisest
and
best
man
of
his
day
a
man
of
family
of
culture
of
wealth
of
learning
loving
leisure
attached
to
his
home
and
country
accustomed
to
honor
and
independence
doomed
to
exile
poverty
neglect
and
hatred
without
those
compensations
which
men
of
genius
in
our
time
secure
but
i
would
not
attempt
to
excite
pity
for
an
outward
condition
which
developed
the
higher
virtues
for
a
thorny
path
which
led
to
the
regions
of
eternal
light
dante
may
have
walked
in
bitter
tears
to
paradise
but
after
the
fashion
of
saints
and
martyrs
in
all
ages
of
our
world
he
need
but
cast
his
eyes
on
that
emblem
which
was
erected
on
every
pinnacle
of
mediaeval
churches
to
symbolize
passing
suffering
with
salvation
infinite
the
great
and
august
creed
of
the
age
in
which
he
lived
though
now
buried
amid
the
triumphs
of
an
imposing
material
civilization
whose
end
is
the
adoration
of
the
majesty
of
man
rather
than
the
majesty
of
god
the
wonders
of
creation
rather
than
the
greatness
of
the
creator
but
something
more
was
required
in
order
to
write
an
immortal
poem
than
even
native
genius
great
learning
and
profound
experience
the
soul
must
be
stimulated
to
the
work
by
an
absorbing
and
ennobling
passion
this
passion
dante
had
and
it
is
as
memorable
as
the
mortal
loves
of
abélard
and
héloïse
and
infinitely
more
exalting
since
it
was
spiritual
and
immortal
even
the
adoration
of
his
lamented
and
departed
beatrice
i
wish
to
dwell
for
a
moment
perhaps
longer
than
to
some
may
seem
dignified
on
this
ideal
or
sentimental
love
it
may
seem
trivial
and
unimportant
to
the
eye
of
youth
or
a
man
of
the
world
or
a
woman
of
sensual
nature
or
to
unthinking
fools
and
butterflies
but
it
is
invested
with
dignity
to
one
who
meditates
on
the
mysteries
of
the
soul
the
wonders
of
our
higher
nature
one
of
the
things
which
arrest
the
attention
of
philosophers
it
is
recorded
and
attested
even
by
dante
himself
that
at
the
early
age
of
nine
he
fell
in
love
with
beatrice
a
little
girl
of
one
of
his
neighbors
and
that
he
wrote
to
her
sonnets
as
the
mistress
of
his
devotion
how
could
he
have
written
sonnets
without
an
inspiration
unless
he
felt
sentiments
higher
than
we
associate
with
either
boys
or
girls
the
boy
was
father
of
the
man
she
appeared
to
me
says
the
poet
at
a
festival
dressed
in
that
most
noble
and
honorable
color
scarlet
girded
and
ornamented
in
a
manner
suitable
to
her
age
and
from
that
moment
love
ruled
my
soul
and
after
many
days
had
passed
it
happened
that
passing
through
the
street
she
turned
her
eyes
to
the
spot
where
i
stood
and
with
ineffable
courtesy
she
greeted
me
and
this
had
such
an
effect
on
me
that
it
seemed
i
had
reached
the
furthest
limit
of
blessedness
i
took
refuge
in
the
solitude
of
my
chamber
and
thinking
over
what
had
happened
to
me
i
proposed
to
write
a
sonnet
since
i
had
already
acquired
the
art
of
putting
words
into
rhyme
this
from
his
vita
nuova
his
first
work
relating
to
the
new
life
which
this
love
awoke
in
his
young
soul
thus
according
to
dante
own
statement
was
the
seed
of
a
passion
planted
in
his
soul
the
small
beginning
so
insignificant
to
cynical
eyes
that
it
would
almost
seem
preposterous
to
allude
to
it
as
if
this
fancy
for
a
little
girl
in
scarlet
and
in
a
boy
but
nine
years
of
age
could
ripen
into
anything
worthy
to
be
soberly
mentioned
by
a
grave
and
earnest
poet
in
the
full
maturity
of
his
genius
worthy
to
give
direction
to
his
lofty
intellect
worthy
to
be
the
occasion
of
the
greatest
poem
the
world
has
seen
from
homer
to
modern
times
absurd
ridiculous
great
rivers
can
not
rise
from
such
a
spring
tall
trees
can
not
grow
from
such
a
little
acorn
thus
reasons
the
man
who
does
not
take
cognizance
of
the
mighty
mysteries
of
human
life
if
anything
tempted
the
boy
to
write
sonnets
to
a
little
girl
it
must
have
been
the
chivalric
element
in
society
at
that
period
when
even
boys
were
required
to
choose
objects
of
devotion
and
to
whom
they
were
to
be
loyal
and
whose
honor
they
were
bound
to
defend
but
the
grave
poet
in
the
decline
of
his
life
makes
this
simple
confession
as
the
beginning
of
that
sentiment
which
never
afterwards
departed
from
him
and
which
inspired
him
to
his
grandest
efforts
but
this
youthful
attachment
was
unfortunate
beatrice
did
not
return
his
passion
and
had
no
conception
of
its
force
and
perhaps
was
not
even
worthy
to
call
it
forth
she
may
have
been
beautiful
she
may
have
been
gifted
she
may
have
been
commonplace
it
matters
little
whether
she
was
intellectual
or
not
beautiful
or
not
it
was
not
the
flesh
and
blood
he
saw
but
the
image
of
beauty
and
loveliness
which
his
own
mind
created
he
idealized
the
girl
she
was
to
him
all
that
he
fancied
but
she
never
encouraged
him
she
denied
his
greetings
and
even
avoided
his
society
at
last
she
died
when
he
was
and
left
him
to
use
his
own
expression
to
ruminate
on
death
and
envy
whomsoever
dies
to
console
himself
he
read
boëthius
and
religious
philosophy
was
ever
afterwards
his
favorite
study
nor
did
serenity
come
so
deep
were
his
sentiments
so
powerful
was
his
imagination
until
he
had
formed
an
exalted
purpose
to
write
a
poem
in
her
honor
and
worthy
of
his
love
if
it
please
him
through
whom
all
things
come
said
dante
that
my
life
be
spared
i
hope
to
tell
such
things
of
her
as
never
before
have
been
seen
by
any
one
now
what
inspired
so
strange
a
purpose
was
it
a
platonic
sentiment
like
the
love
of
petrarch
for
laura
or
something
that
we
can
not
explain
and
yet
real
a
mystery
of
the
soul
in
its
deepest
cravings
and
aspirations
and
is
love
among
mortals
generally
based
on
such
a
foundation
is
it
flesh
and
blood
we
love
is
it
the
intellect
is
it
the
character
is
it
the
soul
is
it
what
is
inherently
interesting
in
woman
and
which
everybody
can
see
the
real
virtues
of
the
heart
and
charms
of
physical
beauty
or
is
it
what
we
fancy
in
the
object
of
our
adoration
what
exists
already
in
our
own
minds
the
archetypes
of
eternal
ideas
of
beauty
and
grace
and
do
all
men
worship
these
forms
of
beauty
which
the
imagination
creates
can
any
woman
or
any
man
seen
exactly
as
they
are
incite
a
love
which
is
kindred
to
worship
and
is
any
love
worthy
to
be
called
love
if
it
does
not
inspire
emotions
which
prompt
to
labor
and
lofty
ends
can
a
woman
smiles
incite
to
herculean
energies
and
drive
the
willing
worshipper
to
aönian
heights
unless
under
these
smiles
are
seen
the
light
of
life
and
the
blessedness
of
supernatural
fervor
is
there
and
can
there
be
a
perpetuity
in
mortal
charms
without
the
recognition
or
the
supposition
of
a
moral
beauty
connected
with
them
which
alone
is
pure
and
imperishable
and
which
alone
creates
the
sacred
ecstasy
that
revels
in
the
enjoyment
of
what
is
divine
or
what
is
supposed
to
be
divine
not
in
man
but
in
the
conceptions
of
man
the
glories
of
goodness
or
of
truth
which
the
excited
soul
doth
see
in
the
eyes
and
expression
of
the
adored
image
it
is
these
archetypes
of
divinity
real
or
fancied
which
give
to
love
all
that
is
enduring
destroy
these
take
away
the
real
or
fancied
glories
of
the
soul
and
mind
and
the
holy
flame
soon
burns
out
no
mortal
love
can
last
no
mortal
love
is
beautiful
unless
the
visions
which
the
mind
creates
are
not
more
or
less
realized
in
the
object
of
it
or
when
a
person
either
man
or
woman
is
not
capable
of
seeing
ideal
perfections
the
loves
of
savages
are
the
loves
of
brutes
the
more
exalted
the
character
and
the
soul
the
greater
is
the
capacity
of
love
and
the
deeper
its
fervor
it
is
not
the
object
of
love
which
creates
this
fervor
but
the
mind
which
is
capable
of
investing
it
with
glories
there
could
not
have
been
such
intensity
in
dante
love
had
he
not
been
gifted
with
the
power
of
creating
so
lofty
and
beautiful
an
ideal
and
it
was
this
he
worshipped
not
the
real
beatrice
but
the
angelic
beauty
he
thought
he
saw
in
her
why
could
he
not
see
the
perfections
he
adored
shining
in
other
women
who
perhaps
had
a
higher
claim
to
them
ah
that
is
the
mystery
and
you
can
not
solve
it
any
easier
than
you
can
tell
why
a
flower
blooms
or
a
seed
germinates
and
why
was
it
that
dante
with
his
great
experience
could
in
later
life
see
the
qualities
he
adored
in
no
other
woman
than
in
the
cold
and
unappreciative
girl
who
avoided
him
suppose
she
had
become
his
wife
might
he
not
have
been
disenchanted
and
his
veneration
been
succeeded
by
a
bitter
disappointment
yet
while
the
delusion
lasted
no
other
woman
could
have
filled
her
place
in
no
other
woman
could
he
have
seen
such
charms
no
other
love
could
have
inspired
his
soul
to
make
such
labors
i
would
not
be
understood
as
declaring
that
married
love
must
be
necessarily
a
disenchantment
i
would
not
thus
libel
humanity
and
insult
plain
reason
and
experience
many
loves
happy
and
burn
brighter
and
brighter
to
the
end
but
it
is
because
there
are
many
who
are
worthy
of
them
both
men
and
women
because
the
ideal
which
the
mind
created
realized
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
although
the
loftier
the
archetype
the
less
seldom
is
it
found
nor
is
it
necessary
that
perfection
should
be
found
a
person
may
have
faults
which
alienate
and
disenchant
but
with
these
there
may
be
virtues
so
radiant
that
the
worship
though
imperfect
remains
a
respect
on
the
whole
so
great
that
the
soul
is
lifted
to
admiration
who
can
love
this
perishable
form
unless
one
sees
in
it
some
traits
which
belong
to
superior
and
immortal
natures
and
hence
the
sentiment
when
pure
creates
a
sort
of
companionship
of
beings
robed
in
celestial
light
and
exorcises
those
degrading
passions
which
belong
to
earth
but
dante
saw
no
imperfections
in
beatrice
perhaps
he
had
no
opportunity
to
see
them
his
own
soul
was
so
filled
with
love
his
mind
soared
to
such
exalted
regions
of
adoration
that
when
she
passed
away
he
saw
her
only
in
the
beatified
state
in
company
with
saints
and
angels
and
he
was
wrapped
in
ecstasies
which
knew
no
end
the
unbroken
adoration
of
beauty
grace
and
truth
even
of
those
eternal
ideas
on
which
plato
based
all
that
is
certain
and
all
that
is
worth
living
for
that
sublime
realism
without
which
life
is
a
failure
and
this
world
is
a
mockery
a
delusion
and
a
snare
this
is
the
history
and
exposition
of
that
love
for
beatrice
with
which
the
whole
spiritual
life
of
dante
is
identified
and
without
which
the
divine
comedy
might
not
have
been
written
i
may
have
given
to
it
disproportionate
attention
and
it
is
true
i
might
have
allegorized
it
and
for
love
of
a
woman
i
might
have
substituted
love
for
an
art
even
the
art
of
poetry
in
which
his
soul
doubtless
lived
even
as
michael
angelo
his
greatest
lived
in
the
adoration
of
beauty
grace
and
majesty
oh
happy
and
favored
is
the
person
who
lives
in
the
enjoyment
of
an
art
it
may
be
humble
it
may
be
grand
it
may
be
music
it
may
be
painting
or
sculpture
or
architecture
or
poetry
or
oratory
or
landscape
gardening
yea
even
farming
or
or
house
decoration
anything
which
employs
the
higher
faculties
of
the
mind
and
brings
order
out
of
confusion
and
takes
one
from
himself
from
the
drudgery
of
mechanical
labors
even
if
it
be
no
higher
than
carving
a
mantelpiece
or
making
a
savory
dish
for
all
these
things
imply
creation
alike
the
test
and
the
reward
of
genius
itself
which
almost
every
human
being
possesses
in
some
form
or
other
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
one
of
the
kindest
gifts
of
deity
to
man
the
great
artist
kindled
by
his
visions
of
imperishable
loveliness
in
the
person
of
his
departed
beatrice
now
resolves
to
dedicate
to
her
honor
his
great
even
his
immortal
poem
which
should
be
a
transcript
of
his
thoughts
a
mirror
of
his
life
a
record
of
his
sorrows
a
painting
of
his
experiences
a
description
of
what
he
saw
a
digest
of
his
great
meditations
a
thesaurus
of
the
treasures
of
the
mediaeval
age
an
exposition
of
its
great
and
leading
ideas
in
philosophy
and
in
religion
every
great
man
wishes
to
leave
behind
some
monument
of
his
labors
to
bless
or
instruct
mankind
any
man
without
some
form
of
this
noble
ambition
lives
in
vain
even
if
his
monument
be
no
more
than
a
cultivated
farm
rescued
from
wildness
and
sterility
now
dante
monument
is
the
marvellous
mystic
unfathomable
song
in
which
he
sang
his
sorrows
and
his
joys
revealed
his
visions
and
recorded
the
passions
and
sentiments
of
his
age
it
never
can
be
popular
because
it
is
so
difficult
to
be
understood
and
because
its
leading
ideas
are
not
in
harmony
with
those
which
are
now
received
i
doubt
if
anybody
can
delight
in
that
poem
unless
he
sympathizes
with
the
ideas
of
the
middle
ages
or
at
least
unless
he
is
familiar
with
them
and
with
the
historical
characters
who
lived
in
those
turbulent
and
gloomy
times
there
is
more
talk
and
pretension
about
that
book
than
any
one
that
i
know
of
like
the
faerie
queene
or
the
paradise
lost
it
is
a
study
rather
than
a
recreation
one
of
those
productions
which
an
educated
person
ought
to
read
in
the
course
of
his
life
and
which
if
he
can
read
in
the
original
and
has
read
is
apt
to
boast
of
like
climbing
a
lofty
mountain
enjoyable
to
some
with
youth
and
vigor
and
enthusiasm
and
love
of
nature
but
a
very
toilsome
thing
to
most
people
especially
if
old
and
and
gouty
in
the
year
the
first
part
of
the
divine
comedy
the
was
finished
by
dante
at
the
age
of
in
the
tenth
year
of
his
pilgrimage
under
the
roof
of
the
marquis
of
lunigiana
and
it
was
intrusted
to
the
care
of
fra
ilario
a
monk
living
on
the
beautiful
ligurian
shores
as
everybody
knows
it
is
a
vivid
graphic
picture
of
what
was
supposed
to
be
the
infernal
regions
where
great
sinners
are
punished
with
various
torments
forever
and
ever
it
is
interesting
for
the
excellence
of
the
poetry
the
brilliant
analyses
of
characters
the
allusion
to
historical
events
the
bitter
invectives
the
intense
sarcasms
and
the
serious
earnest
spirit
which
underlies
the
descriptions
but
there
is
very
little
of
gentleness
or
compassion
in
view
of
the
protracted
torments
of
the
sufferers
we
stand
aghast
in
view
of
the
miseries
and
monsters
furies
and
gorgons
snakes
and
fires
demons
filth
lakes
of
pitch
pools
of
blood
plains
of
scorching
sands
circles
and
chimeras
dire
a
physical
hell
of
utter
and
unspeakable
dreariness
and
despair
awfully
and
powerfully
described
but
still
repulsive
in
each
of
the
dismal
abodes
far
down
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
which
dante
is
supposed
to
have
visited
with
virgil
as
a
guide
in
which
some
infernal
deity
presides
all
sorts
of
physical
tortures
are
accumulated
inflicted
on
traitors
murderers
robbers
men
who
have
committed
great
crimes
unpunished
in
their
lifetime
such
men
as
cain
judas
ugolino
men
consigned
to
an
infamous
immortality
on
the
great
culprits
of
history
and
of
italy
especially
dante
virtually
sits
in
judgment
and
he
consigns
them
equally
to
various
torments
which
we
shudder
to
think
of
and
here
let
me
say
as
a
general
criticism
that
in
the
are
brought
out
in
tremendous
language
the
opinions
of
the
middle
ages
in
reference
to
retribution
dante
does
not
rise
above
them
with
all
his
genius
he
is
not
emancipated
from
them
it
is
the
rarest
thing
in
this
world
for
any
man
however
profound
his
intellect
and
bold
his
spirit
to
be
emancipated
from
the
great
and
leading
ideas
of
his
age
abraham
was
and
moses
and
the
founder
of
buddhism
and
socrates
and
mohammed
and
luther
but
they
were
reformers
more
or
less
divinely
commissioned
with
supernatural
aid
in
many
instances
to
give
them
wisdom
but
homer
was
not
nor
euripides
nor
the
great
scholastics
of
the
middle
ages
nor
even
popes
the
venerated
doctors
and
philosophers
prelates
scholars
nobles
kings
to
say
nothing
of
the
people
thought
as
dante
did
in
reference
to
future
punishment
that
it
was
physical
awful
accumulative
infinite
endless
the
wrath
of
avenging
deity
displayed
in
pains
and
agonies
inflicted
on
the
body
like
the
tortures
of
inquisitors
thus
appealing
to
the
fears
of
men
on
which
chiefly
the
power
of
the
clergy
was
based
nor
in
these
views
of
endless
physical
sufferings
as
if
the
body
itself
were
eternal
and
indestructible
is
there
the
refinement
of
milton
who
placed
misery
in
the
upbraidings
of
conscience
in
mental
torture
rather
than
bodily
in
the
everlasting
pride
and
rebellion
of
the
followers
of
satan
and
his
fallen
angels
it
was
these
awful
views
of
protracted
and
eternal
physical
torments
not
the
hell
of
the
bible
but
the
hell
of
priests
of
human
invention
which
gives
to
the
middle
ages
a
sorrowful
and
repulsive
light
thus
nursing
superstition
and
working
on
the
fears
of
mankind
rather
than
on
the
conscience
and
the
sense
of
moral
accountability
but
how
could
dante
have
represented
the
ideas
of
the
middle
ages
if
he
had
not
painted
his
in
the
darkest
colors
that
the
imagination
could
conceive
unless
he
had
soared
beyond
what
is
revealed
into
the
unfathomable
and
mysterious
and
unrevealed
regions
of
the
second
death
after
various
wanderings
in
france
and
italy
and
after
an
interval
of
three
years
dante
produced
the
second
part
of
the
poem
the
in
which
he
assumes
another
style
and
sings
another
song
in
this
we
are
introduced
to
an
illustrious
company
many
beloved
friends
poets
musicians
philosophers
generals
even
prelates
and
popes
whose
deeds
and
thoughts
were
on
the
whole
beneficent
these
illustrious
men
temporarily
expiate
the
sins
of
anger
of
envy
avarice
gluttony
pride
ambition
the
great
defects
which
were
blended
with
virtues
and
which
are
to
be
purged
out
of
them
by
suffering
their
torments
are
milder
and
amid
them
they
discourse
on
the
principles
of
moral
wisdom
they
utter
noble
sentiments
they
discuss
great
themes
they
show
how
vain
is
wealth
and
power
and
fame
they
preach
sermons
in
these
discourses
dante
shows
his
familiarity
with
history
and
philosophy
he
unfolds
that
moral
wisdom
for
which
he
is
most
distinguished
his
scorn
is
now
tempered
with
tenderness
he
shows
a
true
humanity
he
is
more
forgiving
more
generous
more
sympathetic
he
is
more
lofty
if
he
is
not
more
intense
he
sees
the
end
of
expiations
the
sufferers
will
be
restored
to
peace
and
joy
but
even
in
his
purgatory
as
in
his
hell
he
paints
the
ideas
of
his
age
he
makes
no
new
or
extraordinary
revelations
he
arrives
at
no
new
philosophy
he
is
the
christian
poet
after
the
pattern
of
his
age
it
is
plain
that
the
middle
ages
must
have
accepted
or
invented
some
relief
from
punishment
or
every
christian
country
would
have
been
overwhelmed
with
the
blackness
of
despair
men
could
not
live
if
they
felt
they
could
not
expiate
their
sins
who
could
smile
or
joke
or
eat
or
sleep
or
have
any
pleasure
if
he
thought
seriously
there
would
be
no
cessation
or
release
from
endless
pains
who
could
discharge
his
ordinary
duties
or
perform
his
daily
occupations
if
his
father
or
his
mother
or
his
sister
or
his
brother
or
his
wife
or
his
son
or
his
daughter
might
not
be
finally
forgiven
for
the
frailties
of
an
imperfect
nature
which
he
had
inherited
the
catholic
church
in
its
benignity
at
what
time
i
do
not
know
opened
the
future
of
hope
amid
the
speculations
of
despair
she
saved
the
middle
ages
from
universal
gloom
if
speculation
or
logic
or
tradition
or
scripture
pointed
to
a
hell
of
reprobation
there
must
be
also
a
purgatory
as
the
field
of
expiation
for
expiation
there
must
be
for
sin
somewhere
somehow
according
to
immutable
laws
unless
a
mantle
of
universal
forgiveness
were
spread
over
sinners
who
in
this
life
had
given
no
sufficient
proofs
of
repentance
and
faith
expiation
was
the
great
element
of
mediaeval
theology
it
may
have
been
borrowed
from
india
but
it
was
engrafted
on
the
christian
system
sometimes
it
was
made
to
take
place
in
this
life
when
the
sinner
having
pleased
god
entered
at
once
upon
heavenly
beatitudes
hence
fastings
scourgings
ascetic

replaced
by

in

by
a
righteous
life
i
allude
to
this
notion
of
purgatory
which
early
entered
into
the
creeds
of
theologians
and
which
was
adopted
by
the
catholic
church
to
show
how
powerful
it
was
when
human
consciousness
sought
a
relief
from
the
pains
of
endless
physical
torments
after
dante
had
written
his
he
retired
to
the
picturesque
mountains
which
separate
tuscany
from
modena
and
bologna
and
in
the
hospitium
of
an
ancient
monastery
on
the
woody
summit
of
a
rock
from
which
he
might
gaze
on
his
ungrateful
country
he
renewed
his
studies
in
philosophy
and
theology
there
too
in
that
calm
retreat
he
commenced
his
the
subject
of
profound
meditations
on
what
was
held
in
highest
value
in
the
middle
ages
the
themes
are
theological
and
metaphysical
they
are
such
as
interested
thomas
aquinas
and
bonaventura
anselm
and
bernard
they
are
such
as
do
not
interest
this
age
even
the
most
gifted
minds
for
our
times
are
comparatively
indifferent
to
metaphysical
subtleties
and
speculations
beatrice
and
peter
and
benedict
alike
discourse
on
the
recondite
subjects
of
the
bible
in
the
style
of
mediaeval
doctors
the
themes
are
great
the
incarnation
the
immortality
of
the
soul
the
resurrection
of
the
body
salvation
by
faith
the
triumph
of
christ
the
glory
of
paradise
the
mysteries
of
the
divine
and
human
natures
and
with
these
disquisitions
are
reproofs
of
bad
popes
and
even
of
some
of
the
bad
customs
of
the
church
like
indulgences
and
the
corruptions
of
the

system
the
is
a
thesaurus
of

obscure

lofty

virgil
here
has
ceased
to

but
beatrice
robed
in
celestial
loveliness
conducts
him
from
circle
to
circle
and
explains
the
sublimest
doctrines
and
resolves
his
mortal
doubts
the
object
still
of
his
adoration
and
inferior
only
to
the
mother
of

the

even

devoutly

prayed

beyond

limit
fixed

counsel
thou
art
the
one
who
such
nobility
to
human
nature
gave
that
its
creator
did
not

to
make
himself
its
creature
not

thy
benignity
gives
succor
to
him
who
asketh
it

oftentimes
forerunneth
of

thee

of

in
the
glorious
meditation
of
those
grand
subjects
which
had
such
a
charm
for
benedict
and
bernard
and
which
almost
offset
the
barbarism
and
misery
of
the
middle
ages
to
many
still
regarded
as
ages
of
faith
dante
seemingly
forgets
his
wrongs
and
in
the
company
of
her
whom
he
adores
he
seems
to
revel
in
the
solemn
ecstasy
of
a
soul
transported
to
the
realms
of
eternal
light
he
lives
now
with
the
angels
and
the
mysteries
like
to
the
fire
that
in
a
cloud
imprisoned
doth
break
out
expansive
thus
in
that
heavenly
banqueting
his
soul
outgrew
himself
and
in
the
transport
lost
holds
no
remembrance
now
of
what
she
was
the
paradise
of
dante
is
not
gloomy
although
it
be
obscure
and
indefinite
it
is
the
unexplored
world
of
thought
and
knowledge
the
explanation
of
dogmas
which
his
age
accepted
it
is
a
revelation
of
glories
such
as
only
a
lofty
soul
could
conceive
but
could
not
paint
a
supernal
happiness
given
only
to
favored
mortals
to
saints
and
martyrs
who
have
triumphed
over
the
seductions
of
sense
and
the
temptations
of
life
a
beatified
state
of
blended
ecstasy
and
love
had
i
a
tongue
in
eloquence
as
rich
as
is
the
coloring
in
loom
all
too
poor
to
utter
the
least
part
of
that
enchantment
such
is
this
great
poem
in
all
its
parts
and
exposition
of
the
ideas
of
the
age
sometimes
fierce
and
sometimes
tender
profound
and
infantine
lofty
and
degraded
like
the
church
itself
which
conserved
these
sentiments
it
is
an
intensely
religious
poem
and
yet
more
theological
than
christian
and
full
of
classical
allusions
to
pagan
heroes
and
sages
a
most
remarkable
production
considering
the
age
and
when
we
remember
that
it
is
without
a
prototype
in
any
language
a
glorious
monument
of
reviving
literature
both
original
and
powerful
its
appearance
was
of
course
an
epoch
calling
out
the
admiration
of
italians
and
of
all
who
could
understand
it
of
all
who
appreciated
its
moral
wisdom
in
every
other
country
of
europe
and
its
fame
has
been
steadily
increasing
although
i
fear
much
of
the
popular
enthusiasm
is
exaggerated
and
unfelt
one
who
can
read
italian
well
may
see
its
fiery
emphasis
and
depth
its
condensed
thought
and
language
its
supernal
scorn
and
supernal
love
its
bitterness
and
its
forgiveness
but
very
few
sympathize
with
its
theology
or
its
philosophy
or
care
at
all
for
the
men
whose
crimes
he
punishes
and
whose
virtues
he
rewards
but
there
is
great
interest
in
the
man
as
well
as
in
the
poem
which
he
made
the
mirror
of
his
life
and
the
register
of
his
sorrows
and
of
those
speculations
in
which
he
sought
to
banish
the
remembrance
of
his
misfortunes
his
life
like
his
poem
is
an
epic
we
sympathize
with
his
resentments
which
exile
and
poverty
made
perpetually
fresh
the
sincerity
of
his
early
passion
for
beatrice
says
hallam
pierces
through
the
veil
of
allegory
which
surrounds
her
while
the
memory
of
his
injuries
pursues
him
into
the
immensity
of
eternal
light
and
even
in
the
company
of
saints
and
angels
his
unforgiving
spirit
darkens
at
the
name
of
florence
he
combines
the
profoundest
feelings
of
religion
with
those
patriotic
recollections
which
were
suggested
by
the
reappearance
of
the
illustrious
dead
next
to
michael
angelo
he
was
the
best
of
all
famous
italians
stained
by
no
marked
defects
but
bitterness
pride
and
scorn
while
his
piety
his
patriotism
and
elevation
of
soul
stand
out
in
marked
contrast
with
the
selfishness
and
venality
and
hypocrisy
and
cruelty
of
the
leading
men
in
the
history
of
his
times
he
wrote
with
his
heart
blood
he
wrote
in
poverty
exile
grief
and
neglect
he
wrote
like
an
inspired
prophet
of
old
he
seems
to
have
been
specially
raised
up
to
exalt
virtue
and
vindicate
the
ways
of
god
to
man
and
prepare
the
way
for
a
new
civilization
he
breathes
angry
defiance
to
all
tyrants
he
consigns
even
popes
to
the
torments
he
created
he
ridicules
fools
he
exposes
knaves
he
detests
oppression
he
is
a
prophet
of
liberty
he
sees
into
all
shams
and
all
hypocrisies
and
denounces
lies
he
is
temperate
in
eating
and
drinking
he
has
no
vices
he
believes
in
friendship
in
love
in
truth
he
labors
for
the
good
of
his
countrymen
he
is
affectionate
to
those
who
comprehend
him
he
accepts
hospitalities
but
will
not
stoop
to
meanness
or
injustice
he
will
not
return
to
his
native
city
which
he
loves
so
well
even
when
permitted
if
obliged
to
submit
to
humiliating
ceremonies
he
even
refuses
a
laurel
crown
from
any
city
but
from
the
one
in
which
he
was
born
no
honors
could
tempt
him
to
be
untrue
unto
himself
no
tasks
are
too
humble
to
perform
if
he
can
make
himself
useful
at
ravenna
he
gives
lectures
to
the
people
in
their
own
language
regarding
the
restoration
of
the
latin
impossible
and
wishing
to
bring
into
estimation
the
richness
of
the
vernacular
tongue
and
when
his
work
is
done
he
dies
before
he
becomes
old
having
fulfilled
his
his
last
retreat
was
at
ravenna
and
his
last
days
were
soothed
with
gentle
attentions
from
guido
da
polenta
that
kind
duke
who
revived
his
fainting
hopes
it
was
in
his
service
as
ambassador
to
venice
that
dante
sickened
and
died
a
funeral
sermon
was
pronounced
upon
him
by
his
friend
the
duke
and
beautiful
monuments
were
erected
to
his
memory
too
late
the
florentines
begged
for
his
remains
and
did
justice
to
the
man
and
the
poet
as
well
they
might
since
his
is
the
proudest
name
connected
with
their
annals
he
is
indeed
one
of
the
great
benefactors
of
the
world
itself
for
the
richness
of
his
immortal
legacy
could
the
proscribed
and
exiled
poet
as
he
wandered
isolated
and
alone
over
the
hills
of
italy
and
as
he
stopped
here
and
there
at
some
friendly
monastery
wearied
and
hungry
have
cast
his
prophetic
eye
down
the
vistas
of
the
ages
could
he
have
seen
what
honors
would
be
bestowed
upon
his
name
and
how
his
poem
written
in
sorrow
would
be
scattered
in
joy
among
all
nations
giving
a
new
direction
to
human
thought
shining
as
a
fixed
star
in
the
realms
of
genius
and
kindling
into
shining
brightness
what
is
only
a
reflection
of
its
rays
yea
how
it
would
be
committed
to
memory
in
the
rising
universities
and
be
commented
on
by
the
most
learned
expositors
in
all

schools

to
the
skies

countrymen

by
the

midway

was

with
whom
the

may

or
modern
history
to
begin
the
fourteenth

is
interesting
for
the
awakening
especially
in

of
literature
and
art
for
the
wars
between
the
french
and
english
and
the
english
and

for

which
swept
over
europe
known
in

as
the
black
death
for

and
for
the
rise
of
the
english
house
of
commons
as
a
great
constitutional
power
in
most
of
these
movements
we
see
especially
a
simultaneous
rising
among
the
people
in
the
more
civilized
countries
of
europe
to
obtain
charters
of
freedom
and
municipal
and
political
privileges
extorted
from
monarchs
in
their
necessities
the
fourteenth
century
was
marked
by
protests
and
warfare
equally
against
feudal
institutions
and
royal
tyranny
the
way
was
prepared
by
the
wars
of
kings
which
crippled
their
resources
as
the
crusades
had
done
a
century
before
the
supreme
miseries
of
the
people
led
them
to
political
revolts
and
insurrections
blind
but
fierce
movements
not
inspired
by
ideas
of
liberty
but
by
a
sense
of
oppression
and
degradation
accompanying
these
popular
insurrections
were
religious
protests
against
the
corrupt
institutions
of
the
church
in
the
midst
of
these
popular
agitations
aggressive
and
needless
wars

chaucer
arose
his
remarkable
career
extended
over
the
last
half
of
the
fourteenth
century
when
public
events
were
of
considerable
historical
importance
it
was
then
that
parliamentary
history
became
interesting
until
then
the
barons
clergy
knights
of
the
shire
and
burgesses
of
the
town
summoned
to
assist
the
royal
councils
deliberated
in
separate
chambers
or
halls
but
in
the
reign
of
edward
iii
the
representatives
of
the
knights
of
the
shires
and
the
burgesses
united
their
interests
and
formed
a
body
strong
enough
to
check
royal
encroachments
and
became
known
henceforth
as
the
house
of
commons
in
thirty
years
this
body
had
wrested
from
the
crown
the
power
of
arbitrary
taxation
had
forced
upon
it
new
ministers
and
had
established
the
principle
that
the
redress
of
grievances
preceded
grants
of
supply
edward
iii
was
compelled
to
grant
twenty
parliamentary
confirmations
of
magna
charta
at
the
close
of
his
reign
it
was
conceded
that
taxes
could
be
raised
only
by
consent
of
the
commons
and
they
had
sufficient
power
also
to
prevent
the
collection
of
the
tax
which
the
pope
had
levied
on
the
country
since
the
time
of
john
called
peter
pence
the
latter
part
of
the
fourteenth
century
must
not
be
regarded
as
an
era
of
the
triumph
of
popular
rights
but
as
the
period
when
these
rights
began
to
be
asserted
long
and
dreary
was
the
march
of
the
people
to
complete
political
enfranchisement
from
the
rebellion
under
wat
tyler
to
the
passage
of
the
reform
bill
in
our
times
but
the
commons
made
a
memorable
stand
against
edward
iii
when
he
was
the
most
powerful
sovereign
of
western
europe
one
which
would
have
been
impossible
had
not
this
able
and
ambitious
sovereign
been
embroiled
in
desperate
war
both
with
the
scotch
and
french
with
the
assertion
of
political
rights
we
notice
the
beginning
of
commercial
enterprise
and
manufacturing
industry
a
colony
of
flemish
weavers
was
established
in
england
by
the
enlightened
king
although
wool
continued
to
be
exported
it
was
not
until
the
time
of
elizabeth
that
the
raw
material
was
consumed
at
home
still
the
condition
of
the
common
people
was
dreary
enough
at
this
time
when
compared
with
what
it
is
in
our
age
they
perhaps
were
better
fed
on
the
necessities
of
life
than
they
are
now
all
meats
were
comparatively
cheaper
but
they
had
no
luxuries
not
even
wheaten
bread
their
houses
were
small
and
dingy
and
a
single
chamber
sufficed
for
a
whole
family
both
male
and
female
neither
glass
windows
nor
chimneys
were
then
in
use
nor
knives
nor
forks
nor
tea
nor
coffee
not
even
potatoes
still
less
tropical
fruits
the
people
had
neither
nor
carpets
nor
glass
nor
crockery
ware
nor
cotton
dresses
nor
books
nor
schools
they
were
robbed
by
feudal
masters
and
cheated
and
imposed
upon
by
friars
and
pedlers
but
a
grim
cheerfulness
shone
above
their
discomforts
and
miseries
and
crime
was
uncommon
and
severely
punished
they
amused
themselves
with
rough
sports
and
cherished
religious
sentiments
they
were
brave
and
patriotic
it
was
to
describe
the
habits
and
customs
of
these
people
as
well
as
those
of
the
classes
above
them
to
give
dignity
to
consecrated
sentiments
and
to
shape
the
english
language
that
chaucer
was
raised
up
he
was
born
it
is
generally
supposed
in
the
year
but
nothing
is
definitely
known
of
him
till
when
edward
iii
had
been
reigning
about
thirty
years
it
is
surmised
that
his
father
was
a
respectable
citizen
of
london
that
he
was
educated
at
cambridge
and
oxford
that
he
went
to
paris
to
complete
his
education
in
the
most
famous
university
in
the
world
that
he
then
extensively
travelled
in
france
holland
and
flanders
after
which
he
became
a
student
of
law
in
the
inner
temple
even
then
he
was
known
as
a
poet
and
his
learning
and
accomplishments
attracted
the
attention
of
edward
who
was
a
patron
of
genius
and
who
gave
him
a
house
in
woodstock
near
the
royal
palace
at
this
time
chaucer
was
a
handsome
witty
modest
dignified
man
of
letters
in
easy
circumstances
moving
in
the
higher
ranks
of
society
and
already
known
for
his
troilus
and
cresseide
which
was
then
doubtless
the
best
poem
in
the
language
it
was
then
that
the
intimacy
began
between
him
and
john
of
gaunt
a
youth
of
eighteen
then
earl
of
richmond
fourth
son
of
edward
afterwards
known
as
the
great
duke
of
lancaster
the
most
powerful
nobleman
that
ever
lived
in
england
also
the
richest
possessing
large
estates
in
eighteen
counties
as
well
as
six
earldoms
this
friendship
between
the
poet
and
the
first
prince
of
the
blood
after
the
prince
of
wales
seems
to
have
arisen
from
the
admiration
of
john
of
gaunt
for
the
genius
and
accomplishments
of
chaucer
who
was
about
ten
years
the
elder
it
was
not
until
the
prince
became
the
duke
of
lancaster
that
he
was
the
friend
and
protector
of
wyclif
and
from
different
reasons
seeing
that
the
oxford
scholar
and
theologian
could
be
of
use
to
him
in
his
warfare
against
the
clergy
who
were
hostile
to
his
ambitious
designs
chaucer
he
loved
as
a
bright
and
witty
companion
wyclif
he
honored
as
the
most
learned
churchman
of
the
age
the
next
authentic
event
in
chaucer
life
occurred
in
when
he
accompanied
the
king
to
france
in
that
fruitless
expedition
which
was
soon
followed
by
the
peace
of
brétigny
in
this
unfortunate
campaign
chaucer
was
taken
prisoner
but
was
ransomed
by
his
sovereign
for
about
equal
to
in
these
times
he
had
probably
before
this
been
installed
at
court
as
a
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
on
a
stipend
which
would
now
be
equal
to
a
year
he
seems
to
have
been
a
favorite
with
the
court
after
he
had
written
his
first
great
poem
it
is
singular
that
in
a
rude
and
ignorant
age
poets
should
have
received
much
greater
honor
than
in
our
enlightened
times
gower
was
patronized
by
the
duke
of
gloucester
as
chaucer
was
by
the
duke
of
lancaster
and
petrarch
and
boccaccio
were
in
italy
by
princes
and
nobles
even
learning
was
held
in
more
reverence
in
the
fourteenth
century
than
it
is
in
the
nineteenth
the
scholastic
doctor
was
one
of
the
great
dignitaries
of
the
age
as
well
as
of
the
schools
and
ranked
with
bishops
and
abbots
wyclif
at
one
time
was
the
most
influential
man
in
the
english
church
sitting
in
parliament
and
sent
by
the
king
on
important
diplomatic
missions
so
chaucer
with
less
claim
received
valuable
offices
and
which
made
him
a
wealthy
man
and
he
was
also
sent
on
important
missions
in
the
company
of
nobles
he
lived
at
the
court
his
son
thomas
married
one
of
the
richest
heiresses
in
the
kingdom
and
became
speaker
of
the
house
of
commons
while
his
daughter
alice
married
the
duke
of
suffolk
whose
grandson
was
declared
by
richard
iii
to
be
his
heir
and
came
near
becoming
king
of
england
chaucer
wife
sister
married
the
duke
of
lancaster
himself
so
he
was
allied
with
the
royal
family
if
not
by
blood
at
least
by
ambitious
marriage
connections
i
know
of
no
poet
in
the
history
of
england
who
occupied
so
high
a
social
position
as
did
chaucer
or
who
received
so
many
honors
the
poet
of
the
people
was
the
companion
of
kings
and
princes
at
one
time
he
had
a
reverse
of
fortune
when
his
friend
and
patron
the
duke
of
lancaster
was
in
disgrace
and
in
voluntary
banishment
during
the
minority
of
richard
against
whom
he
had
intrigued
and
who
afterwards
was
dethroned
by
henry
a
son
of
the
duke
of
lancaster
while
the
duke
of
gloucester
was
in
power
chaucer
was
deprived
of
his
offices
and
revenues
for
two
or
three
years
and
was
even
imprisoned
in
the
tower
but
when
lancaster
returned
from
the
continent
his
offices
and
revenues
were
restored
his
latter
days
were
luxurious
and
honored
at
he
gave
up
his
public
duties
as
a
collector
of
customs
chiefly
on
wool
and
retired
to
woodstock
and
spent
the
remainder
of
his
fortunate
life
in
dignified
leisure
and
literary
labors
in
addition
to
his
revenues
the
duke
of
lancaster
who
was
virtually
the
ruler
of
the
land
during
the
reign
of
richard
gave
him
the
castle
of
donnington
with
its
park
and
gardens
so
that
he
became
a
man
of
territorial
influence
at
the
age
of
he
removed
to
london
and
took
a
house
in
the
precincts
of
westminster
abbey
where
the
chapel
of
henry
vii
now
stands
he
died
the
following
year
and
was
buried
in
the
abbey
church
that
sepulchre
of
princes
and
bishops
and
abbots
his
body
was
deposited
in
the
place
now
known
as
the
poets
corner
and
a
fitting
monument
to
his
genius
was
erected
over
his
remains
as
the
first
great
poet
that
had
appeared
in
england
probably
only
surpassed
in
genius
by
shakspeare
until
the
language
assumed
its
present
form
he
was
regarded
as
a
moral
phenomenon
whom
kings
and
princes
delighted
to
honor
as
leonardo
da
vinci
died
in
the
arms
of
francis
so
chaucer
rested
in
his
grave
near
the
bodies
of
those
sovereigns
and
princes
with
whom
he
lived
in
intimacy
and
friendship
it
was
the
rarity
of
his
gifts
his
great
attainments
elegant
manners
and
refined
tastes
which
made
him
the
companion
of
the
great
since
at
that
time
only
princes
and
nobles
and
ecclesiastical
dignitaries
could
appreciate
his
genius
or
enjoy
his
writings
although
chaucer
had
written
several
poems
which
were
admired
in
his
day
and
made
translations
from
the
french
among
which
was
the
roman
de
la
rose
the
most
popular
poem
of
the
middle
ages
a
poem
which
represented
the
difficulties
attendant
on
the
passion
of
love
under
the
emblem
of
a
rose
which
had
to
be
plucked
amid
thorns
yet
his
best
works
were
written
in
the
leisure
of
declining
years
the
occupation
of
the
poet
during
the
last
twelve
years
of
his
life
was
in
writing
his
canterbury
tales
on
which
his
fame
chiefly
rests
written
not
for
money
but
because
he
was
impelled
to
write
it
as
all
true
poets
write
and
all
great
artists
paint
because
they
can
not
help
writing
and
painting
as
the
solace
and
enjoyment
of
life
for
his
day
these
tales
were
a
great
work
of
art
evidently
written
with
great
care
they
are
also
stamped
with
the
inspiration
of
genius
although
the
stories
themselves
were
copied
in
the
main
from
the
french
and
italian
even
as
the
french
and
italians
copied
from
oriental
writers
whose
works
were
translated
into
the
languages
of
europe
so
that
the
romances
of
the
middle
ages
were
originally
produced
in
india
persia
and
arabia
absolute
creation
is
very
rare
even
shakspeare
the
most
original
of
poets
was
indebted
to
french
and
italian
writers
for
the
plots
of
many
of
his
best
dramas
who
can
tell
the
remote
sources
of
human
invention
who
knows
the
then
popular
songs
which
homer
probably
incorporated
in
his
epics
who
can
trace
the
fountains
of
those
streams
which
have
fertilized
the
literary
world
and
hence
how
shallow
the
criticism
which
would
detract
from
literary
genius
because
it
is
indebted
more
or
less
to
the
men
who
have
lived
ages
ago
it
is
the
way
of
putting
things
which
constitutes
the
merit
of
men
of
genius
what
has
voltaire
or
hume
or
froude
told
the
world
essentially
that
it
did
not
know
before
read
for
instance
historians
on
joan
of
arc
they
all
relate
substantially
the
same
facts
genius
and
originality
are
seen
in
the
reflections
and
deductions
and
grand
sentiments
prompted
by
the
narrative
let
distinguished
and
learned
theologians
write
sermons
on
abraham
or
moses
or
david
they
will
all
be
different
yet
the
main
facts
will
be
common
to
all
the
canterbury
tales
are
great
creations
from
the
humor
the
wit
the
naturalness
the
vividness
of
description
and
the
beauty
of
the
sentiments
displayed
in
them
although
sullied
by
occasional
vulgarities
and
impurities
which
however
in
all
their
coarseness
do
not
corrupt
the
mind
byron
complained
of
their
coarseness
but
byron
poetry
is
far
more
demoralizing
the
age
was
coarse
not
the
mind
of
the
author
and
after
five
hundred
years
with
all
the
obscurity
of
language
and
obsolete
modes
of
spelling
they
still
give
pleasure
to
the
true
lovers
of
poetry
when
they
have
once
mastered
the
language
which
is
not
after
all
very
difficult
it
is
true
that
most
people
prefer
to
read
the
great
masters
of
poetry
in
later
times
but
the
canterbury
tales
are
interesting
and
instructive
to
those
who
study
the
history
of
language
and
literature
they
are
links
in
the
civilization
of
england
they
paint
the
age
more
vividly
and
accurately
than
any
known
history
the
men
and
women
of
the
fourteenth
century
of
all
ranks
stand
out
to
us
in
fresh
and
living
colors
we
see
them
in
their
dress
their
feasts
their
dwellings
their
language
their
habits
and
their
manners
amid
all
the
changes
in
human
thought
and
in
social
institutions
the
characters
appeal
to
our
common
humanity
essentially
the
same
under
all
human
conditions
the
men
and
women
of
the
fourteenth
century
love
and
hate
eat
and
drink
laugh
and
talk
as
they
do
in
the
nineteenth
they
delight
as
we
do
in
the
varieties
of
dress
of
parade
and
luxurious
feasts
although
the
form
of
these
has
changed
they
are
alive
to
the
same
sentiments
which
move
us
they
like
fun
and
jokes
and
amusement
as
much
as
we
they
abhor
the
same
class
of
defects
which
disgust
us
hypocrisies
shams
lies
the
inner
circle
of
their
friendship
is
the
same
as
ours
based
on
sincerity
and
admiration
there
is
the
same
infinite
variety
in
character
and
yet
the
same
uniformity
the
human
heart
beats
to
the
same
sentiments
that
it
does
under
all
civilizations
and
conditions
of
life
no
people
can
live
without
friendship
and
sympathy
and
love
and
these
are
ultimate
sentiments
of
the
soul
which
are
as
eternal
as
the
ideas
of
plato
why
do
the
psalms
of
david
written
for
an
oriental
people
four
thousand
years
ago
excite
the
same
emotions
in
the
minds
of
the
people
of
england
or
france
or
america
that
they
did
among
the
jews
it
is
because
they
appeal
to
our
common
humanity
which
never
changes
the
same
as
it
was
in
the
beginning
and
will
be
to
the
end
it
is
only
form
and
fashion
which
change
men
remain
the
same
the
men
and
women
of
the
bible
talked
nearly
the
same
as
we
do
and
seem
to
have
had
as
great
light
on
the
primal
principles
of
wisdom
and
truth
and
virtue
who
can
improve
on
the
sagacity
and
worldly
wisdom
of
the
proverbs
of
solomon
they
have
a
perennial
freshness
and
appeal
to
universal
experience
it
is
this
fidelity
to
nature
which
is
one
of
the
great
charms
of
shakspeare
we
quote
his
brief
sayings
as
expressive
of
what
we
feel
and
know
of
the
certitudes
of
our
moral
and
intellectual
life
they
will
last
forever
under
every
variety
of
government
of
social
institutions
of
races
and
of
languages
and
they
will
last
because
these
sentiments
are
put
in
such
pithy
compressed
unique
and
novel
form
like
the
proverbs
of
solomon
or
the
sayings
of
epictetus
all
nations
and
ages
alike
recognize
the
moral
wisdom
in
the
sayings
of
those
immortal
sages
whose
writings
have
delighted
and
enlightened
the
world
because
they
appeal
to
consciousness
or
experience
now
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
poetry
of
chaucer
does
not
abound
in
the
moral
wisdom
and
spiritual
insight
and
profound
reflections
on
the
great
mysteries
of
human
life
which
stand
out
so
conspicuously
in
the
writings
of
dante
shakspeare
milton
goethe
and
other
poets
he
does
not
describe
the
inner
life
but
the
outward
habits
and
condition
of
the
people
of
his
times
he
is
not
serious
enough
nor
learned
enough
to
enter
upon
the
discussion
of
those
high
themes
which
agitated
the
schools
and
universities
as
dante
did
one
hundred
years
before
he
tells
us
how
monks
and
friars
lived
not
how
they
dreamed
and
speculated
nor
are
his
sarcasms
scorching
and
bitter
but
rather
humorous
and
laughable
he
shows
himself
to
be
a
genial
and
loving
companion
not
an
austere
teacher
of
disagreeable
truths
he
is
not
solemn
and
intense
like
dante
he
does
not
give
wings
to
his
fancy
like
spenser
he
has
not
the
divine
insight
of
shakspeare
he
is
not
learned
like
milton
he
is
not
sarcastic
like
pope
he
does
not
rouse
the
passions
like
byron
he
is
not
meditative
like
wordsworth
but
he
paints
nature
with
great
accuracy
and
delicacy
as
also
the
men
and
women
of
his
age
as
they
appeared
in
their
outward
life
he
describes
the
passion
of
love
with
great
tenderness
and
simplicity
in
all
his
poems
love
is
his
greatest
theme
which
he
bases
not
on
physical
charms
but
the
moral
beauty
of
the
soul
in
his
earlier
life
he
does
not
seem
to
have
done
full
justice
to
women
whom
he
ridicules
but
does
not
despise
in
whom
he
indeed
sees
the
graces
of
chivalry
but
not
the
intellectual
attraction
of
cultivated
life
but
later
in
life
when
his
experiences
are
broader
and
more
profound
he
makes
amends
for
his
former
mistakes
in
his
legend
of
good
women
which
he
wrote
at
the
command
of
anne
of
bohemia
wife
of
richard
he
eulogizes
the
sex
and
paints
the
most
exalted
sentiments
of
the
heart
he
not
only
had
great
vividness
in
the
description
of
his
characters
but
doubtless
great
dramatic
talent
which
his
age
did
not
call
out
his
descriptions
of
nature
are
very
fresh
and
beautiful
indicating
a
great
love
of
nature
flowers
trees
birds
lawns
gardens
waterfalls
falcons
dogs
horses
with
whom
he
almost
talked
he
had
a
great
sense
of
the
ridiculous
hence
his
humor
and
fun
and
droll
descriptions
which
will
ever
interest
because
they
are
so
fresh
and
vivid
and
as
a
poet
he
continually
improved
as
he
advanced
in
life
his
last
works
are
his
best
showing
the
care
and
labor
he
bestowed
as
well
as
his
fidelity
to
nature
i
am
amazed
considering
his
time
that
he
was
so
great
an
artist
without
having
a
knowledge
of
the
principles
of
art
as
taught
by
the
great
masters
of
composition
but
as
has
been
already
said
his
distinguishing
excellence
is
vivid
and
natural
description
of
the
life
and
habits
not
the
opinions
of
the
people
of
the
fourteenth
century
described
without
exaggeration
or
effort
for
effect
he
paints
his
age
as
molière
paints
the
times
of
louis
and
homer
the
heroic
periods
of
grecian
history
this
fidelity
to
nature
and
inexhaustible
humor
and
living
freshness
and
perpetual
variety
are
the
eternal
charms
of
the
canterbury
tales
they
bring
before
the
eye
the
varied
professions
and
trades
and
habits
and
customs
of
the
fourteenth
century
we
see
how
our
ancestors
dressed
and
talked
and
ate
what
pleasures
delighted
them
what
animosities
moved
them
what
sentiments
elevated
them
and
what
follies
made
them
ridiculous
the
same
naturalness
and
humor
which
marked
don
quixote
and
the
decameron
also
are
seen
in
the
canterbury
tales
chaucer
freed
himself
from
all
the
affectations
and
extravagances
and
artificiality
which
characterized
the
poetry
of
the
middle
ages
with
him
began
a
new
style
in
writing
he
and
wyclif
are
the
creators
of
english
literature
they
did
not
create
a
language
but
they
formed
and
polished
it
the
various
persons
who
figure
in
the
canterbury
tales
are
too
well
known
for
me
to
enlarge
upon
who
can
add
anything
to
the
prologue
in
which
chaucer
himself
describes
the
varied
characters
and
habits
and
appearance
of
the
pilgrims
to
the
shrine
of
thomas
à
becket
at
canterbury
there
are
thirty
of
these
pilgrims
including
the
poet
himself
embracing
nearly
all
the
professions
and
trades
then
known
except
the
higher
dignitaries
of
church
and
state
who
are
not
supposed
to
mix
freely
in
ordinary
intercourse
and
whom
it
would
be
unwise
to
paint
in
their
marked
peculiarities
the
most
prominent
person
as
to
social
standing
is
probably
the
knight
he
is
not
a
nobleman
but
he
has
fought
in
many
battles
and
has
travelled
extensively
his
cassock
is
soiled
and
his
horse
is
strong
but
not
gay
a
very
respectable
man
courteous
and
gallant
a
soldier
corresponding
to
a
modern
colonel
or
captain
his
son
the
esquire
is
a
youth
of
twenty
with
curled
locks
and
embroidered
dress
shining
in
various
colors
like
the
flowers
of
may
gay
as
a
bird
active
as
a
deer
and
gentle
as
a
maiden
the
yeoman
who
attends
them
both
is
clad
in
green
like
a
forester
with
arrows
and
feathers
bearing
the
heavy
sword
and
buckler
of
his
master
the
prioress
is
another
respectable
person
coy
and
simple
with
dainty
fingers
small
mouth
and
clean
attire
a
refined
sort
of
a
woman
for
that
age
ornamented
with
corals
and
brooch
so
stately
as
to
be
held
in
reverence
yet
so
sentimental
as
to
weep
for
a
mouse
caught
in
a
trap
all
characteristic
of
a
respectable
lady
who
has
lived
in
seclusion
a
monk
of
course
in
the
fourteenth
century
was
everywhere
to
be
seen
and
a
monk
we
have
among
the
pilgrims
riding
a
dainty
horse
accompanied
with
greyhounds
loving
fur
trimmings
on
his
benedictine
habit
and
a
fat
swan
to
roast
the
friar
too
we
see
a
mendicant
yet
merry
and
full
of
dalliances
beloved
by
the
common
women
to
whom
he
gave
easy
absolution
a
jolly
vagabond
who
knew
all
the
taverns
and
who
carried
on
his
portly
person
pins
and
songs
and
relics
to
sell
or
to
give
away
and
there
was
the
merchant
with
forked
beard
and
flemish
beaver
hat
and
neatly
clasped
boots
bragging
of
his
gains
and
selling
french
crowns
but
on
the
whole
a
worthy
man
the
oxford
clerk
or
scholar
is
one
of
the
company
silent
and
sententious
as
lean
as
the
horse
on
which
he
rode
with
coat
and
books
of
aristotle
and
his
philosophy
which
he
valued
more
than
gold
of
which
indeed
he
could
boast
but
little
a
man
anxious
to
learn
and
still
more
to
teach
the
sergeant
of
the
law
is
another
prominent
figure
wary
and
wise
discreet
and
dignified
bustling
and
busy
yet
not
so
busy
as
he
seemed
to
be
wearing
a
coat
of
divers
colors
and
riding
very
badly
a
franklin
or
country
gentleman
mixes
with
the
company
with
a
white
beard
and
red
complexion
one
of
epicurus
own
sons
who
held
that
ale
and
wheaten
bread
and
fish
and
dainty
flesh
partridge
fat
were
pure
felicity
evidently
a
man
given
to
hospitality
his
table
dormant
in
his
hall
alway
stood
ready
covered
all
the
longe
day
he
was
a
sheriff
also
to
enforce
the
law
and
to
be
present
at
all
the
county
sessions
the
doctor
of
course
could
not
be
left
out
of
the
company
a
man
who
knew
the
cause
of
every
malady
versed
in
magic
as
well
as
physic
and
grounded
also
in
astronomy
who
held
that
gold
is
the
best
of
cordials
and
knew
how
to
keep
what
he
gained
not
luxurious
in
his
diet
but
careful
what
he
ate
and
drank
the
village
miller
is
not
forgotten
in
this
motley
crowd
rough
brutal
drunken
big
and
brawn
with
a
red
beard
and
a
wart
on
his
nose
and
a
mouth
as
wide
as
a
furnace
a
reveller
and
a
jangler
accustomed
to
take
toll
thrice
and
given
to
all
the
sins
that
then
abounded
he
is
the
most
repulsive
figure
in
the
crowd
both
vulgar
and
wicked
in
contrast
with
him
is
the
or
steward
of
a
lordly
house
a
slender
choleric
man
feared
by
servants
and
gamekeepers
yet
in
favor
with
his
lord
since
he
always
had
money
to
lend
although
it
belonged
to
his
master
an
adroit
agent
and
manager
who
so
complicated
his
accounts
that
no
auditor
could
unravel
them
or
any
person
bring
him
in
arrears
he
rode
a
fine
stallion
wore
a
long
blue
overcoat
and
carried
a
rusty
sword
evidently
a
proud
and
prosperous
man
with
a
monk
and
friar
the
picture
would
be
incomplete
without
a
pardoner
or
seller
of
indulgences
with
yellow
hair
and
smooth
face
loaded
with
a
of
relics
and
pieces
of
the
true
cross
of
which
there
were
probably
cartloads
in
every
country
in
europe
and
of
which
the
popes
had
an
inexhaustible
supply
this
sleek
and
gentle
pedler
of
indulgences
rode
side
by
side
with
a
repulsive
officer
of
the
church
with
a
fiery
red
face
of
whom
children
were
afraid
fond
of
garlic
and
onions
and
strong
wine
and
speaking
only
latin
when
he
was
drunk
but
withal
a
good
fellow
abating
his
lewdness
and
drunkenness
in
contrast
with
the
pardoner
and
sompnour
we
see
the
poor
parson
full
of
goodness
charity
and
love
a
true
shepherd
and
no
mercenary
who
waited
upon
no
pomp
and
sought
no
worldly
gains
happy
only
in
the
virtues
which
he
both
taught
and
lived
some
think
that
chaucer
had
in
view
the
learned
wyclif
when
he
described
the
most
interesting
character
of
the
whole
group
with
him
was
a
ploughman
his
brother
as
good
and
pious
as
he
living
in
peace
with
all
the
world
paying
tithes
cheerfully
laborious
and
conscientious
the
forerunner
of
the
puritan
yeoman
of
this
motley
company
of
pilgrims
i
have
already
spoken
of
the
prioress
a
woman
of
high
position
in
contrast
with
her
is
the
wife
of
bath
who
has
travelled
extensively
even
to
jerusalem
and
rome
charitable
jolly
and
talkative
but
bold
and
masculine
and
coarse
with
a
red
face
and
red
stockings
and
a
hat
as
big
as
a
shield
and
sharp
spurs
on
her
feet
indicating
that
she
sat
on
her
ambler
like
a
man
there
are
other
characters
which
i
can
not
stop
to
mention
the
sailor
browned
by
the
seas
and
sun
and
full
of
stolen
bordeaux
wine
the
haberdasher
the
carpenter
the
weaver
the
dyer
the
the
cook
to
boil
the
chickens
and
the
and
bake
the
pies
and
tarts
mostly
people
from
the
middle
and
lower
ranks
of
society
whose
clothes
are
gaudy
manners
rough
and
language
coarse
but
all
classes
and
trades
and
professions
seem
to
be
represented
except
nobles
bishops
and
abbots
dignitaries
whom
perhaps
chaucer
is
reluctant
to
describe
and
caricature
to
beguile
the
time
on
the
journey
to
canterbury
all
these
various
pilgrims
are
required
to
tell
some
story
peculiar
to
their
separate
walks
of
life
and
it
is
these
stories
which
afford
the
best
description
we
have
of
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
fourteenth
century
as
well
as
of
its
leading
sentiments
and
ideas
the
knight
was
required
to
tell
his
story
first
and
it
naturally
was
one
of
love
and
adventure
although
the
scene
of
it
was
laid
in
ancient
greece
it
delineates
the
institution
of
chivalry
and
the
manners
and
sentiments
it
produced
no
writer
of
that
age
except
perhaps
froissart
paints
the
connection
of
chivalry
with
the
graces
of
the
soul
and
the
moral
beauty
which
poetry
associates
with
the
female
sex
as
chaucer
does
the
aristocratic
woman
of
chivalry
while
delighting
in
martial
sports
and
hence
masculine
and
haughty
is
also
condescending
tender
and
gracious
the
heroic
and
dignified
with
which
chivalry
invested
woman
exalted
the
passion
of
love
allied
with
reverence
for
woman
was
loyalty
to
the
prince
the
rough
warrior
again
becomes
a
gentleman
and
has
access
to
the
best
society
whatever
may
have
been
the
degrees
of
rank
the
haughtiest
nobleman
associated
with
the
penniless
knight
if
only
he
were
a
gentleman
and
well
born
on
terms
of
social
equality
since
chivalry
while
it
created
distinctions
also
levelled
those
which
wealth
and
power
naturally
created
among
the
higher
class
yet
chivalry
did
not
exalt
woman
outside
of
noble
ranks
the
plebeian
woman
neither
has
the
graces
of
the
lady
nor
does
she
excite
that
reverence
for
the
sex
which
marked
her
condition
in
the
feudal
castle
tournaments
and
courts
of
love
were
not
framed
for
village
churls
but
for
dames
and
mighty
earls
chaucer
in
his
description
of
women
in
ordinary
life
does
not
seem
to
have
a
very
high
regard
for
them
they
are
weak
or
coarse
or
sensual
though
attentive
to
their
domestic
duties
and
generally
virtuous
an
exception
is
made
of
virginia
in
the
doctor
tale
who
is
represented
as
beautiful
and
modest
radiant
in
simplicity
discreet
and
true
but
the
wife
of
bath
is
disgusting
from
her
coarse
talk
and
coarser
manners
her
tale
is
to
show
what
a
woman
likes
best
which
according
to
her
is
to
bear
rule
over
her
husband
and
household
the
prioress
is
conventional
and
weak
aping
courtly
manners
the
wife
of
the
host
of
the
tabard
inn
is
a
vixen
and
shrew
who
calls
her
husband
a
milksop
and
is
so
formidable
with
both
her
tongue
and
her
hands
that
he
is
glad
to
make
his
escape
from
her
whenever
he
can
the
pretty
wife
of
the
carpenter
gentle
and
slender
with
her
white
apron
and
open
dress
is
anything
but
intellectual
a
mere
sensual
beauty
most
of
these
women
are
innocent
of
toothbrushes
and
give
and
receive
thrashings
and
sing
songs
without
a
fastidious
taste
and
beat
their
servants
and
nag
their
husbands
but
they
are
good
cooks
and
understand
the
arts
of
brewing
and
baking
and
roasting
and
preserving
and
pickling
as
well
as
of
spinning
and
knitting
and
embroidering
they
are
supreme
in
their
households
they
keep
the
keys
and
lock
up
the
wine
they
are
gossiping
and
love
to
receive
their
female
visitors
they
do
not
do
much
shopping
for
shops
were
very
primitive
with
but
few
things
to
sell
their
knowledge
is
very
limited
and
confined
to
domestic
matters
they
are
on
the
whole
modest
but
are
the
victims
of
friars
and
pedlers
they
have
more
liberty
than
we
should
naturally
suppose
but
have
not
yet
learned
to
discriminate
between
duties
and
rights
there
are
few
disputed
questions
between
them
and
their
husbands
but
the
duty
of
obedience
seems
to
have
been
recognized
but
if
oppressed
they
always
are
free
with
their
tongues
they
give
good
advice
and
do
not
spare
reproaches
in
language
which
in
our
times
we
should
not
call
particularly
choice
they
are
all
fond
of
dress
and
wear
gay
colors
without
much
regard
to
artistic
effect
in
regard
to
the
sports
and
amusements
of
the
people
we
learn
much
from
chaucer
in
one
sense
the
england
of
his
day
was
merry
that
is
the
people
were
noisy
and
rough
in
their
enjoyments
there
was
frequent
ringing
of
the
bells
there
were
the
horn
of
the
huntsman
and
the
excitements
of
the
chase
there
was
boisterous
mirth
in
the
village
there
were
frequent
holidays
and
dances
around
covered
with
ribbons
and
flowers
and
flags
there
were
wandering
minstrels
and
jesters
and
jugglers
and
and
and
games
at
archery
there
were
wrestling
matches
and
and
but
the
exhilaration
of
the
people
was
abnormal
like
the
merriment
of
negroes
on
a
southern
plantation
a
sort
of
rebound
from
misery
and
burdens
which
found
a
vent
in
noise
and
practical
jokes
when
the
ordinary
restraint
was
removed
the
uproarious
joy
was
a
sort
of
defiance
of
the
to
which
workmen
were
doomed
for
when
they
could
be
impressed
by
the
king
architect
and
paid
whatever
he
chose
to
give
them
there
could
not
have
been
much
real
contentment
which
is
generally
placid
and
calm
there
is
one
thing
in
which
all
classes
delighted
in
the
fourteenth
century
and
that
was
a
garden
in
which
flowers
bloomed
things
of
beauty
which
were
as
highly
valued
as
the
useful
moreover
there
was
a
zest
in
rural
sports
now
seldom
seen
especially
among
the
upper
classes
who
could
afford
to
hunt
and
fish
there
was
no
excitement
more
delightful
to
gentlemen
and
ladies
than
that
of
hawking
and
it
infinitely
surpassed
in
interest
any
rural
sport
whatever
in
our
day
under
any
circumstances
hawks
trained
to
do
the
work
of
were
therefore
greater
pets
than
any
dogs
that
now
are
the
company
of
sportsmen
a
lady
without
a
falcon
on
her
wrist
when
mounted
on
her
richly
caparisoned
steed
for
a
morning
sport
was
very
rare
indeed
an
instructive
feature
of
the
canterbury
tales
is
the
view
which
chaucer
gives
us
of
the
food
and
houses
and
dresses
of
the
people
in
the
nonne
prestes
tale
we
see
the
cottage
and
manner
of
life
of
a
poor
widow
she
has
three
daughters
three
pigs
three
oxen
and
a
sheep
her
house
had
only
two
rooms
an
which
also
served
for
a
kitchen
and
and
a
bower
or
bedchamber
both
without
a
chimney
with
holes
pierced
to
let
in
the
light
the
table
was
a
board
put
upon
trestles
to
be
removed
when
the
meal
of
black
bread
and
milk
and
perchance
an
egg
with
bacon
was
over
the
three
slept
without
sheets
or
blankets
on
a
rude
bed
covered
only
with
their
ordinary
their
kitchen
utensils
were
a
brass
pot
or
two
for
boiling
a
few
wooden
platters
an
iron
candlestick
and
a
knife
or
two
while
the
furniture
was
composed
of
two
or
three
chairs
and
stools
with
a
frame
in
the
wall
with
shelves
for
clothes
and
utensils
the
manciple
and
the
cook
of
the
company
seem
to
indicate
that
living
among
the
classes
was
a
very
generous
and
a
very
serious
part
of
life
on
which
a
high
estimate
was
placed
since
food
in
any
variety
though
plentiful
at
times
was
not
always
to
be
had
and
therefore
precarious
guests
at
table
were
paired
and
ate
every
pair
out
of
the
same
plate
or
off
the
same
trencher
but
the
bill
of
fare
at
a
franklin
feast
would
be
deemed
anything
but
poor
even
in
our
times
bacon
and
oysters
fish
stewed
beef
chickens
capons
roast
goose
pig
veal
lamb
kid
pigeon
with
custard
apples
and
pears
cheese
and
spiced
cakes
all
these
with
abundance
of
wine
and
ale
the
canterbury
tales
remind
us
of
the
vast
preponderance
of
the
country
over
town
and
city
life
chaucer
like
shakspeare
revels
in
the
simple
glories
of
nature
which
he
describes
like
a
man
feeling
it
to
be
a
joy
to
be
near
to
mother
earth
with
her
rich
bounties
the
birds
that
usher
in
the
day
the
flowers
which
beautify
the
lawn
the
green
hills
and
vales
with
hues
like
the
clouds
and
the
skies
yet
fruitful
in
wheat
and
grass
the
domestic
animals
so
mute
and
patient
the
bracing
air
of
approaching
winter
the
genial
breezes
of
the
spring
of
all
these
does
the
poet
sing
with
charming
simplicity
and
grace
yea
in
melodious
numbers
for
nothing
is
more
marvellous
than
the
music
and
rhythm
of
his
lines
although
they
are
not
enriched
with
learned
allusions
or
much
moral
wisdom
and
do
not
march
in
the
stately
and
majestic
measure
of
shakspeare
or
of
milton
but
the
most
interesting
and
instructive
of
the
canterbury
tales
are
those
which
relate
to
the
religious
life
the
morals
the
superstitions
and
ecclesiastical
abuses
of
the
times
in
these
we
see
the
need
of
the
reformation
of
which
wyclif
was
the
morning
light
in
these
we
see
the
hypocrisies
and
sensualities
of
both
monks
and
friars
relieved
somewhat
by
the
virtues
of
the
simple
parish
priest
or
poor
parson
in
contrast
with
the
wealth
and
luxury
of
the
regular
clergy
as
monks
were
called
in
their
princely
monasteries
where
the
lordly
abbot
vied
with
both
baron
and
bishop
in
the
magnificence
of
his
ordinary
life
we
see
before
us
the
mediaeval
clergy
in
all
their
privileges
and
yet
in
all
their
ignorance
and
superstition
shielded
from
the
punishment
of
crime
and
the
operation
of
all
ordinary
laws
a
sturdy
defiance
of
the
temporal
powers
the
agents
and
ministers
of
a
foreign
power
armed
with
the
terrors
of
hell
and
the
grave
besides
the
prioress
and
the
priest
we
see
in
living
light
the
habits
and
pretensions
of
the
lazy
monk
the
venal
friar
and
pardoner
and
the
noisy
summoner
for
ecclesiastical
offences
hunters
and
gluttons
are
they
with
greyhounds
and
furs
greasy
and
fat
and
full
of
dalliances
at
home
in
taverns
unprincipled
but
agreeable
vagabonds
who
cheat
and
rob
the
people
and
make
a
mockery
of
what
is
most
sacred
on
the
earth
these
privileged
mendicants
with
their
relics
and
indulgences
their
arts
and
their
lies
and
the
scandals
they
create
are
treated
by
chaucer
with
blended
humor
and
severity
showing
a
mind
as
enlightened
as
that
of
the
great
scholar
at
oxford
who
heads
the
movement
against
rome
and
the
abuses
at
which
she
connived
if
she
did
not
encourage
and
there
is
something
intensely
english
in
his
disgust
and
scorn
brave
for
his
day
yet
shielded
by
the
great
duke
who
was
at
once
his
protector
and
friend
as
he
was
of
wyclif
himself
in
his
severer
denunciation
and
advocacy
of
doctrines
which
neither
chaucer
nor
the
duke
of
lancaster
understood
and
which
if
they
had
they
would
not
have
sympathized
with
nor
encouraged
in
these
attacks
on
ecclesiastics
and
ecclesiastical
abuses
chaucer
should
be
studied
with
wyclif
and
the
early
reformers
although
he
would
not
have
gone
so
far
as
they
and
led
unlike
them
a
worldly
life
thus
by
these
poems
he
has
rendered
a
service
to
his
country
outside
his
literary
legacy
which
has
always
been
held
in
value
the
father
of
english
poetry
belonged
to
the
school
of
progress
and
of
inquiry
like
his
great
contemporaries
on
the
continent
but
while
he
paints
the
manners
customs
and
characters
of
the
fourteenth
century
he
does
not
throw
light
on
the
great
ideas
which
agitated
or
enslaved
the
age
he
is
too
real
and
practical
for
that
he
describes
the
outward
not
the
inner
life
he
was
not
serious
enough
i
doubt
if
he
was
learned
enough
to
enter
into
the
disquisitions
of
schoolmen
or
the
mazes
of
the
scholastic
philosophy
or
the
meditations
of
almost
inspired
sages
it
is
not
the
joys
of
heaven
or
the
terrors
of
hell
on
which
he
discourses
but
of
men
and
women
as
they
lived
around
him
in
their
daily
habits
and
occupations
we
must
go
to
wyclif
if
we
would
know
the
theological
or
philosophical
doctrines
which
interested
the
learned
chaucer
only
tells
how
monks
and
friars
lived
not
how
they
speculated
or
preached
we
see
enough
however
to
feel
that
he
was
emancipated
from
the
ideas
of
the
middle
ages
and
had
cast
off
their
gloom
their
superstition
and
their
despair
the
only
things
he
liked
of
those
dreary
times
were
their
courts
of
love
and
their
chivalric
glories
i
do
not
propose
to
analyze
the
poetry
of
chaucer
or
enter
upon
a
critical
inquiry
as
to
his
relative
merits
in
comparison
with
the
other
great
poets
it
is
sufficient
for
me
to
know
that
critics
place
him
very
high
as
an
original
poet
although
it
is
admitted
that
he
drew
much
of
his
material
from
french
and
italian
authors
he
was
for
his
day
a
great
linguist
he
had
travelled
extensively
and
could
speak
latin
french
and
italian
with
fluency
he
knew
petrarch
and
other
eminent
italians
one
is
amazed
that
in
such
an
age
he
could
have
written
so
well
for
he
had
no
great
models
to
help
him
in
his
own
language
if
occasionally
indecent
he
is
not
corrupting
he
never
deliberately
disseminates
moral
poison
and
when
he
speaks
of
love
he
treats
almost
solely
of
the
simple
and
genuine
emotions
of
the
heart
the
best
criticism
that
i
have
read
of
chaucer
poetry
is
that
of
adolphus
william
ward
although
as
a
biography
it
is
not
so
full
or
so
interesting
as
that
of
godwin
or
even
morley
in
no
life
that
i
have
read
are
the
mental
characteristics
of
our
poet
so
ably
drawn
his
practical
good
sense
his
love
of
books
his
still
deeper
love
of
nature
his
naïveté
the
readiness
of
his
description
the
brightness
of
his
imagery
the
easy
flow
of
his
diction
the
vividness
with
which
he
describes
character
his
inventiveness
his
readiness
of
illustration
his
musical
rhythm
his
gaiety
and
cheerfulness
his
vivacity
and
joyousness
his
pathos
and
tenderness
his
keen
sense
of
the
ridiculous
and
power
of
satire
without
being
bitter
so
that
his
wit
and
fun
are
harmless
and
perpetually
pleasing
he
doubtless
had
great
dramatic
talent
but
he
did
not
live
in
a
dramatic
age
his
especial
excellence
never
surpassed
was
his
power
of
observing
and
drawing
character
united
with
boundless
humor
and
cheerful
fun
and
his
descriptions
of
nature
are
as
true
and
unstinted
as
his
descriptions
of
men
and
women
so
that
he
is
as
fresh
as
the
month
of
may
in
his
poetry
is
life
and
hence
his
immortal
fame
he
is
not
so
great
as
spenser
or
shakspeare
or
milton
but
he
has
the
same
vitality
as
they
and
is
as
wonderful
as
they
considering
his
age
and
opportunities
a
poet
who
constantly
improved
as
he
advanced
in
life
and
whose
greatest
work
was
written
in
his
old
age
unfortunately
we
know
but
little
of
chaucer
habits
and
experiences
his
trials
and
disappointments
his
friendships
or
his
hatreds
what
we
do
know
of
him
raises
our
esteem
though
convivial
he
was
temperate
though
genial
he
was
a
silent
observer
quiet
in
his
manners
modest
in
his
intercourse
with
the
world
walking
with
downcast
eye
but
letting
nothing
escape
his
notice
he
believed
in
friendship
and
kept
his
friends
to
the
end
and
was
stained
neither
by
envy
nor
by
pride
as
frank
as
he
was
affectionate
as
gentle
as
he
was
witty
living
with
princes
and
nobles
he
never
descended
to
gross
adulation
and
never
wrote
a
line
of
approval
of
the
usurpation
of
henry
although
his
bread
depended
on
henry
favor
and
he
was
also
the
son
of
the
earliest
and
best
friend
he
was
not
a
religious
man
nor
was
he
an
immoral
man
judged
by
the
standard
of
his
age
he
probably
was
worldly
as
he
lived
in
courts
we
do
not
see
in
him
the
stern
virtues
of
dante
or
milton
nothing
of
that
moral
earnestness
which
marked
the
only
other
great
man
with
whom
he
was
contemporary
he
who
is
called
the
morning
star
of
the
reformation
but
then
we
know
nothing
about
him
which
calls
out
severe
reprobation
he
was
patriotic
and
had
the
confidence
of
his
sovereign
else
he
would
not
have
been
employed
on
important
missions
and
the
sweetness
of
his
character
may
be
inferred
from
his
long
and
tender
friendship
with
gower
whom
some
in
that
age
considered
the
greater
poet
he
was
probably
luxurious
in
his
habits
but
intemperate
use
of
wine
he
detested
and
avoided
he
was
portly
in
his
person
but
refinement
marked
his
features
he
was
a
gentleman
according
to
the
severest
code
of
chivalric
excellence
always
a
favorite
with
ladies
and
equally
admired
by
the
knights
and
barons
of
a
brilliant
court
no
poet
was
ever
more
honored
in
his
life
or
lamented
in
his
death
as
his
beautiful
monument
in
westminster
abbey
would
seem
to
attest
that
monument
is
the
earliest
that
was
erected
to
the
memory
of
a
poet
in
that
pantheon
of
english
men
of
rank
and
genius
and
it
will
probably
be
as
long
preserved
as
any
of
those
sculptured
urns
and
animated
busts
which
seek
to
keep
alive

maritime
discoveries
about
thirteen
hundred
years
ago
when
attila
the
hun
called
the
scourge
of
god
was
overrunning
the
falling
empire
of
the
romans
some
of
the
noblest
citizens
of
the
small
cities
of
the
adriatic
fled
with
their
families
and
effects
to
the
inaccessible
marshes
and
islands
at
the
extremity
of
that
sea
and
formed
a
permanent
settlement
they
became
fishermen
and
small
traders
in
process
of
time
they
united
their
islands
together
by
bridges
and
laid
the
foundation
of
a
mercantile
state
thither
resorted
the
merchants
of
mediaeval
europe
to
make
exchanges
thus
venice
became
rich
and
powerful
and
in
the
twelfth
century
it
was
one
of
the
prosperous
states
of
europe
ruled
by
an
oligarchy
of
the
leading
merchants
contemporaneous
with
dante
one
of
the
most
distinguished
citizens
of
this
mercantile
mart
marco
polo
impelled
by
the
curiosity
which
reviving
commerce
excited
and
the
restless
adventure
of
a
crusading
age
visited
the
court
of
the
great
khan
of
tartary
whose
empire
was
the
largest
in
the
world
after
a
residence
of
seventeen
years
during
which
he
was
loaded
with
honors
he
returned
to
his
native
country
not
by
the
ordinary
route
but
by
coasting
the
eastern
shores
of
asia
through
the
indian
ocean
up
the
persian
gulf
and
thence
through
bagdad
and
constantinople
bringing
with
him
immense
wealth
in
precious
stones
and
other
eastern
commodities
the
report
of
his
wonderful
adventures
interested
all
europe
for
he
was
supposed
to
have
found
the
tarshish
of
the
scriptures
that
land
of
gold
and
spices
which
had
enriched
the
tyrian
merchants
in
the
time
of
solomon
men
supposed
by
some
to
have
sailed
around
the
cape
of
good
hope
in
their
three
years
voyages
among
the
wonderful
things
which
polo
had
seen
was
a
city
on
an
island
off
the
coast
of
china
which
was
represented
to
contain
six
hundred
thousand
families
so
rich
that
the
palaces
of
its
nobles
were
covered
with
plates
of
gold
so
inviting
that
odoriferous
plants
and
flowers
diffused
the
most
grateful
perfumes
so
strong
that
even
the
tartar
conquerors
of
china
could
not
subdue
it
this
island
known
now
as
japan
was
called
cipango
and
was
supposed
to
be
inexhaustible
in
riches
especially
when
the
reports
of
polo
were
confirmed
by
sir
john
mandeville
an
english
traveller
in
the
time
of
edward
and
with
even
greater
exaggerations
since
he
represented
the
royal
palace
to
be
more
than
six
miles
in
circumference
occupied
by
three
hundred
thousand
men
in
an
awakening
age
of
enterprise
when
chivalry
had
not
passed
away
nor
the
credulity
of
the
middle
ages
the
reports
of
this
cipango
inflamed
the
imagination
of
europe
and
to
reach
it
became
at
once
the
desire
and
the
problem
of
adventurers
and
merchants
but
how
could
this
el
dorado
be
reached
not
by
sailing
round
africa
for
to
sail
south
in
popular
estimation
was
to
encounter
torrid
suns
with
ever
increasing
heat
and
suffocating
vapors
and
unknown
dangers
the
scientific
world
had
lost
the
knowledge
of
what
even
the
ancients
knew
nobody
surmised
that
there
was
a
cape
of
good
hope
which
could
be
doubled
and
would
open
the
way
to
the
indian
ocean
and
its
islands
of
spices
and
gold
nor
could
this
cipango
be
reached
by
crossing
the
eastern
continent
for
the
journey
was
full
of
perils
dangers
and
insurmountable
obstacles
among
those
who
meditated
on
this
geographical
mystery
was
a
young
sea
captain
of
genoa
who
had
studied
in
the
university
of
pavia
but
spent
his
early
life
upon
the
waves
intelligent
enterprising
visionary
yet
practical
with
boundless
ambition
not
to
conquer
kingdoms
but
to
discover
new
realms
born
probably
in
in
the
year
he
married
the
daughter
of
an
italian
navigator
living
in
lisbon
and
inheriting
with
her
some
valuable
portuguese
charts
and
maritime
journals
he
settled
in
lisbon
and
took
up
as
a
means
of
livelihood
being
thus
trained
in
both
the
art
and
the
science
of
navigation
his
active
mind
seized
upon
the
most
interesting
theme
of
the
day
his
studies
and
experience
convinced
him
that
the
cipango
of
marco
polo
could
be
reached
by
sailing
directly
west
he
knew
that
the
earth
was
round
and
he
inferred
from
the
plants
and
carved
wood
and
even
human
bodies
that
had
occasionally
floated
from
the
west
that
there
must
be
unknown
islands
on
the
western
coasts
of
the
atlantic
and
that
this
ocean
never
yet
crossed
was
the
common
boundary
of
both
europe
and
asia
in
short
that
the
cipango
could
be
reached
by
sailing
west
and
he
believed
the
thing
to
be
practicable
for
the
magnetic
needle
had
been
discovered
or
brought
from
the
east
by
polo
which
always
pointed
to
the
north
star
so
that
mariners
could
sail
in
the
darkest
nights
and
also
another
instrument
had
been
made
essentially
the
modern
quadrant
by
which
latitude
could
be
measured
he
supposed
that
after
sailing
west
about
eight
hundred
leagues
by
the
aid
of
compass
and
quadrant
and
such
charts
as
he
had
collected
and
collated
he
should
find
the
land
of
gold
and
spices
by
which
he
would
become
rich
and
famous
this
was
not
an
absurd
speculation
to
a
man
of
the
intellect
and
knowledge
of
columbus
to
his
mind
there
were
but
few
physical
difficulties
if
he
only
had
the
ships
and
the
men
bold
enough
to
embark
with
him
and
the
patronage
which
was
necessary
for
so
novel
and
daring
an
enterprise
the
difficulties
to
be
surmounted
were
not
so
much
physical
as
moral
it
was
the
surmounting
of
moral
difficulties
which
gives
to
columbus
his
true
greatness
as
a
man
of
genius
and
resources
these
moral
obstacles
were
so
vast
as
to
be
all
but
insurmountable
since
he
had
to
contend
with
all
the
established
ideas
of
his
age
the
superstitions
of
sailors
the
prejudices
of
learned
men
and
general
geographical
ignorance
he
himself
had
neither
money
nor
ships
nor
powerful
friends
nobody
believed
in
him
all
ridiculed
him
some
insulted
him
who
would
furnish
money
to
a
man
who
was
supposed
to
be
half
crazy
certainly
visionary
and
wild
a
rash
adventurer
who
would
not
only
absorb
money
but
imperil
life
learned
men
would
not
listen
to
him
and
powerful
people
derided
him
and
princes
were
too
absorbed
in
wars
and
pleasure
to
give
him
a
helping
hand
aid
could
come
only
from
some
great
state
or
wealthy
prince
but
both
states
and
princes
were
deaf
and
dumb
to
him
it
was
a
most
extraordinary
inspiration
of
genius
in
the
fifteenth
century
which
created
not
an
opinion
but
a
conviction
that
asia
could
be
reached
by
sailing
west
and
how
were
common
minds
to
comprehend
such
a
novel
idea
if
a
century
later
with
all
the
blaze
of
reviving
art
and
science
and
learning
the
most
learned
people
ridiculed
the
idea
that
the
earth
revolved
around
the
sun
even
when
it
was
proved
by
all
the
certitudes
of
mathematical
demonstration
and
unerring
observations
how
could
the
prejudiced
and
priests
of
the
time
of
columbus
who
controlled
the
most
important
affairs
of
state
be
made
to
comprehend
that
an
unknown
ocean
full
of
terrors
could
be
crossed
by
frail
ships
and
that
even
a
successful
voyage
would
open
marts
of
inexhaustible
wealth
all
was
clear
enough
to
this
scientific
and
enterprising
mariner
and
the
inward
assurance
that
he
was
right
in
his
calculation
gave
to
his
character
a
blended
boldness
arrogance
and
dignity
which
was
offensive
to
men
of
exalted
station
and
ill
became
a
stranger
and
adventurer
with
a
coat
and
everything
which
indicated
poverty
neglect
and
hardship
and
without
any
visible
means
of
living
but
by
the
making
and
selling
of
charts
hence
we
can
not
wonder
at
the
seventeen
years
of
poverty
neglect
ridicule
disappointment
and
deferred
hopes
such
as
make
the
heart
sick
which
elapsed
after
columbus
was
persuaded
of
the
truth
of
his
theory
before
he
could
find
anybody
enlightened
enough
to
believe
in
him
or
powerful
enough
to
assist
him
wrapped
up
in
those
glorious
visions
which
come
only
to
a
man
of
superlative
genius
and
which
make
him
insensible
to
heat
and
cold
and
scanty
fare
even
to
reproach
and
scorn
this
intrepid
soul
inspired
by
a
great
and
original
idea
wandered
from
city
to
city
and
country
to
country
and
court
to
court
to
present
the
certain
greatness
and
wealth
of
any
state
that
would
embark
in
his
enterprise
but
all
were
alike
cynical
cold
unbelieving
and
even
insulting
he
opposes
overwhelming
universal
and
overpowering
ideas
to
have
surmounted
these
amid
such
protracted
opposition
and
discouragement
constitutes
his
greatness
and
finally
to
prove
his
position
by
absolute
experiment
and
hazardous
enterprise
makes
him
one
of
the
greatest
of
human
benefactors
whose
fame
will
last
through
all
the
generations
of
men
and
as
i
survey
that
lonely
abstracted
disappointed
and
derided
man
poor
and
unimportant
so
harassed
by
debt
that
his
creditors
seized
even
his
maps
and
charts
obliged
to
fly
from
one
country
to
another
to
escape
imprisonment
without
even
listeners
and
still
less
friends
and
yet
with
faith
in
his
cause
utterly
unconquerable
alone
in
opposition
to
all
the
world
i
think
i
see
the
most
persistent
man
of
enterprise
that
i
have
read
of
in
history
critics
ambitious
to
say
something
new
may
rake
out
slanders
from
the
archives
of
enemies
and
discover
faults
which
derogate
from
the
character
we
have
been
taught
to
admire
and
venerate
they
may
even
point
out
spots
which
we
can
not
disprove
in
that
sun
of
glorious
brightness
which
shed
its
beneficent
rays
over
a
century
of
darkness
but
this
we
know
that
whatever
may
be
the
force
of
detraction
his
fame
has
been
steadily
increasing
even
on
the
admission
of
his
slanderers
for
three
centuries
and
that
he
now
shines
as
a
fixed
star
in
the
constellation
of
the
great
lights
of
modern
times
not
alone
because
he
succeeded
in
crossing
the
ocean
when
once
embarked
on
it
but
for
surmounting
the
moral
difficulties
which
lay
in
his
way
before
he
could
embark
upon
it
and
for
being
finally
instrumental
in
conferring
the
greatest
boon
that
our
world
has
received
from
any
mortal
man
since
noah
entered
into
the
ark
i
think
it
is
lamartine
who
has
said
that
truly
immortal
benefactors
have
seldom
been
able
to
accomplish
their
mission
without
the
encouragement
of
either
saints
or
women
this
is
emphatically
true
in
the
case
of
columbus
the
door
to
success
was
at
last
opened
to
him
by
a
friendly
and
sympathetic
friar
of
a
franciscan
convent
near
the
little
port
of
palos
in
andalusia
the
and
disappointed
adventurer
for
that
is
what
he
was
wearied
and
hungry
and
nearly
discouraged
stopped
at
the
to
get
a
morsel
of
bread
for
his
famished
son
who
attended
him
in
his
pilgrimage
the
prior
of
that
obscure
convent
was
the
first
who
comprehended
the
man
of
genius
not
so
much
because
he
was
an
enlightened
scholar
but
because
his
pious
soul
was
full
of
kindly
sympathy
showing
that
the
instincts
of
love
are
kindred
to
the
inspirations
of
genius
it
was
the
voice
of
ali
and
cadijeh
that
strengthened
mohammed
it
was
catherine
von
bora
who
sustained
luther
in
his
gigantic
task
the
worthy
friar
struck
by
the
noble
bearing
of
a
man
so
poor
and
wearied
became
delighted
with
the
conversation
of
his
guest
who
opened
to
him
both
his
heart
and
his
schemes
he
forwarded
his
plans
by
a
letter
to
a
powerful
ecclesiastic
who
introduced
him
to
the
spanish
court
then
one
of
the
most
powerful
and
certainly
the
proudest
and
most
punctilious
in
europe
ferdinand
of
aragon
was
polite
yet
wary
and
incredulous
but
isabella
of
castile
listened
more
kindly
to
the
stranger
whom
the
greatness
of
his
mission
inspired
with
eloquence
like
the
saint
of
the
convent
she
and
she
alone
of
her
splendid
court
divined
that
there
was
something
to
be
heeded
in
the
words
of
columbus
and
gave
her
womanly
and
royal
encouragement
although
too
much
engrossed
with
the
conquest
of
grenada
and
the
cares
of
her
kingdom
to
pay
that
immediate
attention
which
columbus
entreated
i
may
not
dwell
on
the
vexatious
delays
and
the
protracted
discouragements
of
columbus
after
the
queen
had
given
her
ear
to
his
enthusiastic
prophecies
of
the
future
glories
of
the
kingdom
to
the
court
and
to
the
universities
and
to
the
great
ecclesiastics
he
was
still
a
visionary
and
a
needy
adventurer
and
they
quoted
in
refutation
of
his
theory
those
scripture
texts
which
were
hurled
in
greater
wrath
against
galileo
when
he
announced
his
brilliant
discoveries
there
are
from
some
unfathomed
reason
always
texts
found
in
the
sacred
writings
which
seem
to
conflict
with
both
science
and
a
profound
theology
and
the
pedants
as
well
as
the
hypocrites
and
usurpers
have
always
shielded
themselves
behind
these
in
their
opposition
to
new
opinions
i
will
not
be
hard
upon
them
for
often
they
are
good
men
simply
unable
to
throw
off
the
shackles
of
ages
of
ignorance
and
tyranny
people
should
not
be
subjected
to
lasting
reproach
because
they
can
not
emancipate
themselves
from
prevailing
ideas
if
those
prejudiced
courtiers
and
scholastics
who
ridiculed
columbus
could
only
have
seen
with
his
clearer
insight
they
might
have
loaded
him
with
favors
but
they
were
blinded
and
selfish
and
envious
nor
was
it
until
columbus
convinced
his
sovereigns
that
the
risk
was
small
for
so
great
a
promised
gain
that
he
was
finally
commissioned
to
undertake
his
voyage
the
promised
boon
was
the
riches
of
oriental
countries
boundless
and
magnificent
countries
not
to
be
discovered
but
already
known
only
hard
and
perhaps
impossible
to
reach
and
columbus
himself
was
so
firmly
persuaded
of
the
existence
of
these
riches
and
of
his
ability
to
secure
them
and
they
were
so
exaggerated
by
his
imagination
that
his
own
demands
were
extravagant
and
preposterous
as
must
have
seemed
to
an
incredulous
court
that
he
a
stranger
an
adventurer
almost
a
beggar
even
should
in
case
of
success
be
made
viceroy
and
admiral
over
the
unexplored
realm
and
with
a
tenth
of
all
the
riches
he
should
collect
or
seize
and
that
these
high
offices
almost
regal
should
also
be
continued
not
only
through
his
own
life
but
through
the
lives
of
his
heirs
from
generation
to
generation
thus
raising
him
to
a
possible
rank
higher
than
that
of
any
of
the
dukes
and
grandees
of
spain
ferdinand
and
isabella
however
readily
promised
all
that
the
persistent
and
enthusiastic
adventurer
demanded
doubtless
with
the
feeling
that
there
was
not
more
than
one
chance
in
a
hundred
that
he
would
ever
be
heard
from
again
but
that
this
one
chance
was
well
worth
all
and
more
than
they
expended
a
possibility
of
indefinite
aggrandizement
to
the
eyes
of
ferdinand
there
was
a
prospect
remote
indeed
of
adding
to
the
power
of
the
spanish
monarchy
and
it
is
probable
that
the
pious
isabella
contemplated
also
the
conversion
of
the
heathen
to
christianity
it
is
possible
that
some
motives
may
have
also
influenced
columbus
kindred
to
this
a
renewed
crusade
against
saracen
infidels
which
he
might
undertake
from
the
wealth
he
was
so
confident
of
securing
but
the
probabilities
are
that
columbus
was
urged
on
to
his
career
by
ambitious
and
worldly
motives
chiefly
or
else
he
would
not
have
been
so
greedy
to
secure
honors
and
wealth
nor
would
have
been
so
jealous
of
his
dignity
when
he
had
attained
power
to
me
columbus
was
no
more
a
saint
than
sir
francis
drake
was
when
he
so
unscrupulously
robbed
every
ship
he
could
lay
his
hands
upon
although
both
of
them
observed
the
outward
forms
of
religious
worship
peculiar
to
their
respective
creeds
and
education
there
were
no
unbelievers
in
that
age
both
catholics
and
protestants
like
the
ancient
pharisees
were
scrupulous
in
what
were
supposed
to
be
religious
duties
though
these
too
often
were
divorced
from
morality
it
is
columbus
only
as
an
intrepid
enthusiastic
enlightened
navigator
in
pursuit
of
a
new
world
of
boundless
wealth
that
i
can
see
him
and
it
was
for
his
ultimate
success
in
discovering
this
world
amid
so
many
difficulties
that
he
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
great
benefactor
of
the
glory
of
which
no
ingenuity
or
malice
can
rob
him
at
last
he
sets
sail
august
and
singularly
enough
from
palos
within
sight
of
the
little
convent
where
he
had
received
his
first
encouragement
he
embarked
in
three
small
vessels
the
largest
of
which
was
less
than
one
hundred
tons
and
two
without
decks
but
having
high
poops
and
sterns
inclosed
what
an
insignificant
flotilla
for
such
a
voyage
but
it
would
seem
that
the
admiral
with
great
sagacity
deemed
small
vessels
best
adapted
to
his
purpose
in
order
to
enter
safely
shallow
harbors
and
sail
near
the
coast
he
sails
in
the
most
propitious
season
of
the
year
and
is
aided
by
steady
which
waft
his
ships
gently
through
the
unknown
ocean
he
meets
with
no
obstacles
of
any
account
the
skies
are
serene
the
sea
is
as
smooth
as
the
waters
of
an
inland
lake
and
he
is
comforted
as
he
advances
to
the
west
by
the
appearance
of
strange
birds
and
weeds
and
plants
that
indicate
nearness
to
the
land
he
has
only
two
objects
of
solicitude
the
variations
of
the
magnetic
needle
and
the
superstitious
fears
of
his
men
the
last
he
succeeds
in
allaying
by
inventing
plausible
theories
and
by
concealing
the
real
distance
he
has
traversed
he
encourages
them
by
inflaming
their
cupidity
he
is
nearly
baffled
by
their
mutinous
spirit
he
is
in
danger
not
from
coral
reefs
and
whirlpools
and
sunken
rocks
and
tempests
as
at
first
was
feared
but
from
his
men
themselves
who
clamor
to
return
it
is
his
faith
and
moral
courage
and
fertility
of
resources
which
we
most
admire
days
pass
in
alternate
hope
and
disappointment
amid
angry
clamors
in
great
anxiety
for
no
land
appears
after
he
has
sailed
far
beyond
the
points
where
he
expected
to
find
it
the
world
is
larger
than
even
he
has
supposed
he
promises
great
rewards
to
the
one
who
shall
first
see
the
unknown
shores
it
is
said
that
he
himself
was
the
first
to
discover
land
by
observing
a
flickering
light
which
is
exceedingly
improbable
as
he
was
several
leagues
from
shore
but
certain
it
is
that
the
very
night
the
land
was
seen
from
the
admiral
vessel
it
was
also
discovered
by
one
of
the
seamen
on
board
another
ship
the
problem
of
the
age
was
at
last
solved
a
new
continent
was
given
to
ferdinand
and
isabella
on
the
of
october
columbus
lands
not
however
on
the
continent
as
he
supposed
but
on
an
island
in
great
pomp
as
admiral
of
the
seas
and
viceroy
of
the
king
in
a
purple
doublet
and
with
a
drawn
sword
in
one
hand
and
the
standard
of
spain
in
the
other
followed
by
officers
in
appropriate
costume
and
a
friar
bearing
the
emblem
of
our
redemption
which
is
solemnly
planted
on
the
shore
and
the
land
called
san
salvador
this
little
island
one
of
the
bahamas
is
not
however
gilded
with
the
anticipated
splendors
of
oriental
countries
he
finds
neither
gold
nor
jewels
nor
silks
nor
spices
nor
any
signs
of
civilization
only
naked
men
and
women
without
any
indication
of
wealth
or
culture
or
power
but
he
finds
a
soft
and
genial
climate
and
a
soil
of
unparalleled
fertility
and
trees
and
shrubs
as
green
as
andalusia
in
spring
and
birds
with
every
variety
of
plumage
and
insects
glistening
with
every
color
of
the
rainbow
while
the
natives
are
gentle
and
unsuspecting
and
full
of
worship
columbus
is
disappointed
but
not
discouraged
he
sets
sail
to
find
the
real
cipango
of
which
he
is
in
search
he
cruises
among
the
bahama
islands
discovers
cuba
and
hispaniola
now
called
hayti
explores
their
coasts
holds
peaceful
intercourse
with
the
natives
and
is
transported
with
enthusiasm
in
view
of
the
beauty
of
the
country
and
its
great
capacities
but
he
sees
no
gold
only
a
few
ornaments
to
show
that
there
is
gold
somewhere
near
if
it
only
could
be
found
nor
has
he
reached
the
cipango
of
his
dreams
but
new
countries
of
which
there
was
no
record
or
suspicion
of
existence
yet
of
vast
extent
and
fertile
beyond
knowledge
he
is
puzzled
but
filled
with
intoxicating
joy
he
has
performed
a
great
feat
he
has
doubtless
added
indefinitely
to
the
dominion
of
spain
columbus
leaves
a
small
colony
on
the
island
of
hispaniola
and
with
the
trophies
of
his
discoveries
returns
to
spain
without
serious
obstacles
except
a
short
detention
in
portugal
whither
he
was
driven
by
a
storm
his
stories
fill
the
whole
civilized
world
with
wonder
he
is
welcomed
with
the
most
cordial
and
enthusiastic
reception
the
people
gaze
at
him
with
admiration
his
sovereigns
rise
at
his
approach
and
seat
him
beside
themselves
on
their
gilded
and
canopied
throne
he
has
made
them
a
present
worthy
of
a
god
what
honors
could
be
too
great
for
such
a
man
even
envy
pales
before
the
universal
exhilaration
he
enters
into
the
most
august
circles
as
an
equal
his
dignities
and
honors
are
confirmed
he
is
loaded
with
presents
and
favors
he
is
the
most
marked
personage
in
europe
he
is
almost
stifled
with
the
incense
of
royal
and
popular
idolatry
never
was
a
subject
more
honored
and
caressed
the
imagination
of
a
chivalrous
and
lively
people
is
inflamed
with
the
wildest
expectations
for
although
he
returned
with
but
little
of
the
expected
wealth
he
has
pointed
out
a
land
rich
in
unfathomed
mines
a
second
and
larger
expedition
is
soon
projected
everybody
wishes
to
join
it
all
press
to
join
the
fortunate
admiral
who
has
added
a
continent
to
civilization
the
proudest
nobles
with
the
armor
and
horses
of
chivalry
embark
with
artisans
and

for
another
voyage
now
without
solicitude
or
fear
but
with
unbounded
hopes
of
wealth
especially
hardy
adventurers
and
families
of
rank
anxious
to
retrieve
their
fortunes
the
pendulum
of
a
nation
thought
swings
from
the
extreme
of
doubt
and
cynicism
to
the
opposite
extreme
of
faith
and
exhilaration
spain
was
ripe
for
the
harvest
eight
hundred
years
desperate
contest
with
the
moors
had
made
the
nation
bold
heroic
adventurous
there
were
no
such
warriors
in
all
europe
nowhere
were
there
such
chivalric
virtues
no
people
were
then
animated
with
such
martial
enthusiasm
such
unfettered
imagination
such
heroic
daring
as
were
the
subjects
of
ferdinand
and
isabella
they
were
a
people
to
conquer
a
world
not
merely
heroic
and
enterprising
but
fresh
with
religious
enthusiasm
they
had
expelled
the
infidels
from
spain
they
would
fight
for
the
honor
of
the
cross
in
any
clime
or
land
the
hopes
held
out
by
columbus
were
extravagant
and
these
extravagant
expectations
were
the
occasion
of
his
fall
and
subsequent
sorrows
and
humiliation
doubtless
he
was
sincere
but
he
was
infatuated
he
could
only
see
the
gold
of
cipango
he
was
as
confident
of
enriching
his
followers
as
he
had
been
of
discovering
new
realms
he
was
as
enthusiastic
as
sir
walter
raleigh
a
century
later
and
made
promises
as
rash
as
he
and
created
the
same
exalted
hopes
to
be
followed
by
bitter
disappointments
and
consequently
he
incurred
the
same
hostilities
and
met
the
same
downfall
this
second
expedition
was
undertaken
in
seventeen
vessels
carrying
fifteen
hundred
people
all
full
of
animation
and
hope
and
some
of
them
with
intentions
to
settle
in
the
newly
discovered
country
until
they
had
made
their
fortunes
they
arrived
at
hispaniola
in
march
of
the
year
only
to
discover
that
the
men
left
behind
on
the
first
voyage
to
secure
their
settlement
were
all
despoiled
or
murdered
that
the
natives
had
proved
treacherous
or
that
the
spaniards
had
abused
their
confidence
and
forfeited
their
friendship
they
were
exposed
to
new
hostilities
they
found
the
climate
unhealthy
their
numbers
rapidly
dwindled
away
from
disease
or
poor
food
starvation
stared
them
in
the
face
in
spite
of
the
fertility
of
the
soil
dissensions
and
jealousies
arose
they
were
governed
with
great
difficulty
for
the
haughty
hidalgoes
were
unused
to
menial
labor
and
labor
of
the
most
irksome
kind
was
necessary
law
and
order
were
relaxed
the
blame
of
disaster
was
laid
upon
the
admiral
who
was
accused
of
deceiving
them
evil
reports
were
sent
to
spain
accusing
him
of
incapacity
cruelty
and
oppression
gold
was
found
only
in
small
quantities
some
of
the
leading
men
mutinied
general
discontent
arose
the
greater
part
of
the
colonists
were
disabled
from
sickness
and
debility
no
gold
of
any
amount
was
sent
back
to
spain
only
five
hundred
indian
slaves
to
be
sold
instead
which
led
to
renewed
hostilities
with
the
natives
and
the
necessity
for
their
subjugation
all
of
these
evils
created
bitter
disappointment
in
spain
and
discontent
with
the
measures
and
government
of
columbus
himself
so
that
a
commission
of
inquiry
was
sent
to
hispaniola
headed
by
aguado
who
assumed
arrogant
authority
and
made
it
necessary
for
columbus
to
return
to
spain
without
adding
essentially
to
his
discoveries
he
sailed
around
cuba
and
jamaica
and
other
islands
but
as
yet
had
not
seen
the
mainland
or
found
mines
of
gold
or
silver
he
landed
in
spain
in
to
find
that
his
popularity
had
declined
and
the
old
enthusiasm
had
grown
cold
with
him
landed
a
feeble
train
of
emaciated
men
who
had
nothing
to
relate
but
sickness
hardship
and
disappointment
the
sovereigns
however
received
him
kindly
but
he
was
depressed
and
sad
and
clothed
himself
with
the
habit
of
a
franciscan
friar
to
denote
his
humility
and
dejection
he
displayed
a
few
golden
collars
and
bracelets
as
trophies
with
some
indians
but
these
no
longer
dazzled
the
crowd
it
was
not
until
that
columbus
was
enabled
to
make
his
third
voyage
having
experienced
great
delay
from
the
general
disappointment
instead
of
seventeen
vessels
he
could
collect
but
six
in
this
voyage
he
reached
the
mainland
that
part
called
paria
near
the
mouth
of
the
orinoco
in
south
america
but
he
supposed
it
to
be
an
island
it
was
fruitful
and
populous
and
the
air
was
sweetened
with
the
perfumes
of
flowers
yet
he
did
not
explore
the
coast
to
any
extent
but
made
his
way
to
hispaniola
where
he
had
left
the
discontented
colony
himself
broken
in
health
a
victim
of
gout
haggard
from
anxiety
and
emaciated
by
pain
his
splendid
constitution
was
now
undermined
from
his
various
hardships
and
cares
he
found
the
colony
in
a
worse
state
than
when
he
left
it
under
the
care
of
his
brother
bartholomew
the
indians
had
proved
hostile
the
colonists
were
lazy
and
turbulent
mutiny
had
broken
out
factions
prevailed
as
well
as
general
misery
and
discontent
the
horrors
of
famine
had
succeeded
wars
with
the
natives
there
was
a
general
desire
to
leave
the
settlement
columbus
tried
to
restore
order
and
confidence
but
the
difficulty
of
governing
such
a
disorderly
set
of
adventurers
was
too
great
even
for
him
he
was
obliged
to
resort
to
severities
that
made
him
more
and
more
unpopular
the
complaints
of
his
enemies
reached
spain
he
was
most
cruelly
misrepresented
and
slandered
and
in
the
general
disappointment
and
the
constant
drain
upon
the
mother
country
to
support
the
colony
his
enemies
gained
the
ear
of
his
sovereigns
and
strong
doubts
arose
in
their
minds
about
his
capacity
for
government
so
a
royal
commission
was
sent
out
an
officer
named
bovadilla
with
absolute
power
to
examine
into
the
state
of
the
colony
and
supplant
if
necessary
the
authority
of
columbus
the
result
was
the
arrest
of
columbus
and
his
brothers
who
were
sent
to
spain
in
chains
what
a
change
of
fortune
i
will
not
detail
the
accusations
against
him
just
or
unjust
it
is
mournful
enough
to
see
the
old
man
brought
home
in
irons
from
the
world
he
had
discovered
and
given
to
spain
the
injustice
and
cruelty
which
he
received
produced
a
reaction
and
he
was
once
more
kindly
received
at
court
with
the
promise
that
his
grievances
should
be
redressed
and
his
property
and
dignities
restored
columbus
was
allowed
to
make
one
more
voyage
of
discovery
but
nothing
came
of
it
except
renewed
troubles
hardships
dangers
and
difficulties
wars
with
the
natives
perils
of
the
sea
discontents
disappointments
and
when
at
last
he
returned
to
spain
in
broken
with
age
and
infirmities
after
twelve
years
of
harassing
cares
labors
and
dangers
a
checkered
career
of
glory
and
suffering
nothing
remained
but
to
prepare
for
his
final
rest
he
had
not
made
a
fortune
he
had
not
enriched
his
patrons
but
he
had
discovered
a
continent
his
last
days
were
spent
in
disquieting
and
fruitless
negotiations
to
perpetuate
his
honors
among
his
descendants
he
was
ever
jealous
and
tenacious
of
his
dignities
ferdinand
was
polite
but
selfish
and
cold
nor
can
this
calculating
prince
ever
be
vindicated
from
the
stain
of
gross
ingratitude
columbus
died
in
the
year
at
the
age
of
sixty
a
disappointed
man
but
honors
were
ultimately
bestowed
upon
his
heirs
who
became
grandees
and
dukes
and
intermarried
with
the
proudest
families
of
spain
and
it
is
also
said
that
ferdinand
himself
after
the
death
of
the
great
navigator
caused
a
monument
to
be
erected
to
his
memory
with
this
inscription
to
castile
and
leon
columbus
gave
a
new
world
but
no
man
of
that
century
needed
less
than
columbus
a
monument
to
perpetuate
his
immortal
fame
i
think
that
historians
belittle
columbus
when
they
would
excite
our
pity
for
his
misfortunes
they
insult
the
dignity
of
all
struggling
souls
and
make
utilitarians
of
all
benefactors
and
give
false
views
of
success
few
benefactors
on
the
whole
were
ever
more
richly
rewarded
than
he
he
died
admiral
of
the
seas
a
grandee
of
spain
having
bishops
for
his
eulogists
and
princes
for
his
mourners
the
founder
of
an
illustrious
house
whose
name
and
memory
gave
glory
even
to
the
spanish
throne
and
even
if
he
had
not
been
rewarded
with
material
gains
it
was
enough
to
feel
that
he
had
conferred
a
benefit
on
the
world
which
could
scarcely
be
appreciated
in
his
lifetime
a
benefit
so
transcendent
that
its
results
could
be
seen
only
by
future
generations
who
could
adequately
pay
him
for
his
services
who
could
estimate
the
value
of
his
gift
what
though
they
load
him
with
honors
or
cast
him
tomorrow
into
chains
that
is
the
fate
of
all
immortal
benefactors
since
our
world
began
his
great
soul
should
have
soared
beyond
vulgar
rewards
in
the
loftiness
of
his
he
should
have
accepted
without
a
murmur
whatever
fortune
awaited
him
had
he
merely
given
to
civilization
a
new
style
of
buttons
or
an
improved
envelope
or
a
punch
for
a
railway
conductor
or
a
spring
for
a
carriage
or
a
mining
tool
or
a
screw
or
revolver
or
reaper
the
inventors
of
which
have
seen
millions
in
them
and
been
cheated
out
of
his
gains
he
might
have
whimpered
over
his
wrongs
how
few
benefactors
have
received
even
as
much
as
he
for
he
won
dignities
admiration
and
undying
fame
we
scarcely
know
the
names
of
many
who
have
made
grand
bequests
who
invented
the
mariner
compass
who
gave
the
lyre
to
primeval
ages
or
the
blacksmith
forge
or
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
or
the
arch
in
architecture
or
glass
for
windows
who
solved
the
first
problem
of
geometry
who
first
sang
the
odes
which
homer
incorporated
with
the
iliad
who
first
turned
up
the
earth
with
a
plough
who
first
used
the
weaver
shuttle
who
devised
the
cathedrals
of
the
middle
ages
who
gave
the
keel
to
ships
who
was
the
first
that
raised
bread
by
yeast
who
invented
chimneys
but
all
ages
will
know
that
columbus
discovered
america
and
his
monuments
are
in
every
land
and
his
greatness
is
painted
by
the
ablest
historians
but
i
will
not
enlarge
on
the
rewards
columbus
received
or
the
ingratitude
which
succeeded
them
by
force
of
envy
or
from
the
disappointment
of
worldly
men
in
not
realizing
all
the
gold
that
he
promised
let
me
allude
to
the
results
of
his
discovery
the
first
we
notice
was
the
marvellous
stimulus
to
maritime
adventures
europe
was
inflamed
with
a
desire
to
extend
geographical
knowledge
or
add
new
countries
to
the
realms
of
european
sovereigns
within
four
years
of
the
discovery
of
the
west
india
islands
by
columbus
cabot
had
sailed
past
newfoundland
and
vasco
da

had
doubled
the
cape
of

hope
and
laid
the
foundation
of

empire
in
the
east

of

themselves
at

in

crossed
the

and
reached
the
pacific

the
year
after
that

had
visited
florida
in
the
rio
de
la
plata
was
navigated
and
in
the
portuguese
had
begun
to
trade
with
china
and
bengal
as
early
as
cortes
had
taken
mexico
and
completed
the
conquest
of
that
rich
country
the
following
year
in
cano
circumnavigated
the
globe
in
pizarro
discovered
peru
which
in
less
than
twelve
years
was
completely
subjugated

year

discovered
by

in
the
portuguese
were
admitted
to
trade
with

in

sought
a
passage
to

and
the
following
year
sir
francis

commenced
his
more
famous
voyages
under
the
auspices
of
elizabeth
in
sir
humphrey
gilbert
colonized
virginia
followed
rapidly
by
other
english
settlements
until
before
the
century
closed
the
whole
continent
was
colonized
either
by
spaniards
or
portuguese
or
english
or
french
or
dutch
all
countries
came
in
to
share
the
prizes
held
out
by
the
discovery
of
the
new
world
colonization
followed
the
voyages
of
discovery
it
was
animated
by
the
hope
of
finding
gold
and
precious
stones
it
was
carried
on
under
great
discouragements
and
hardships
and
unforeseen
difficulties
as
a
general
thing
the
colonists
were
not
accustomed
to
manual
labor
they
were
adventurers
and
dependents
on
great
families
who
found
restraint
irksome
and
the
drudgeries
of
their
new
life
almost
unendurable
nor
did
they
intend
at
the
outset
permanent
settlements
they
expected
to
accumulate
gold
and
silver
and
then
return
to
their
country
they
had
sought
to
improve
their
condition
and
their
condition
became
forlorn
they
were
exposed
to
sickness
from
malaria
poor
food
and
hardship
they
were
molested
by
the
natives
whom
they
constantly
provoked
they
were
subject
to
cruel
treatment
on
the
part
of
royal
governors
they
melted
away
wherever
they
settled
by
famine
disease
and
war
whether
in
south
or
north
america
they
were
discontented
and
disappointed
and
not
easily
governed
the
chieftains
quarrelled
with
each
other
and
were
disgraced
by
rapacity
and
cruelty
they
did
not
find
what
they
expected
they
were
lonely
and
desolate
and
longed
to
return
to
the
homes
they
had
left
but
were
frequently
without
means
to
return
doomed
to
remain
where
they
were
and
die
colonization
had
no
dignity
until
men
went
to
the
new
world
for
religious
liberty
or
to
work
upon
the
soil
the
conquest
of
mexico
and
peru
however
opened
up
the
mining
of
gold
and
silver
which
were
finally
found
in
great
abundance
and
when
the
richness
of
these
countries
in
the
precious
metals
was
finally
established
then
a
regular
stream
of
emigrants
flocked
to
the
american
shores
gold
was
at
last
found
but
not
until
thousands
had
miserably
perished
the
mines
of
mexico
and
peru
undoubtedly
enriched
spain
and
filled
europe
with
envy
and
emulation
a
stream
of
gold
flowed
to
the
mother
country
and
the
caravels
which
transported
the
treasures
of
the
new
world
became
objects
of
plunder
to
all
nations
hostile
to
spain
the
seas
were
full
of
pirates
sir
francis
drake
was
an
undoubted
pirate
and
returned
after
his
long
voyage
around
the
world
with
immense
treasure
which
he
had
stolen
then
followed
with
the
eager
search
after
gold
and
silver
a
rapid
demoralization
in
all
maritime
countries
it
would
be
interesting
to
show
how
the
sudden
accumulation
of
wealth
by
spain
led
to
luxury
arrogance
and
idleness
followed
by
degeneracy
and
decay
since
those
virtues
on
which
the
strength
of
man
is
based
are
weakened
by
sudden
wealth
industry
declined
in
proportion
as
spain
became
enriched
by
the
precious
metals
but
this
inquiry
is
foreign
to
my
object
a
still
more
interesting
inquiry
arises
how
far
the
nations
of
europe
were
really
enriched
by
the
rapid
accumulation
of
gold
and
silver
the
search
for
the
precious
metals
may
have
stimulated
commercial
enterprise
but
it
is
not
so
clear
that
it
added
to
the
substantial
wealth
of
europe
except
so
far
as
it
promoted
industry
gold
is
not
wealth
it
is
simply
the
exponent
of
wealth
real
wealth
is
in
farms
and
shops
and
ships
in
the
various
channels
of
industry
in
the
results
of
human
labor
so
far
as
the
precious
metals
enter
into
useful
manufactures
or
into
articles
of
beauty
and
taste
they
are
indeed
inherently
valuable
mirrors
plate
jewelry
watches
gilded
furniture
the
adornments
of
the
person
in
an
important
sense
constitute
wealth
since
all
nations
value
them
and
will
pay
for
them
as
they
do
for
corn
or
oil
so
far
as
they
are
connected
with
art
they
are
valuable
in
the
same
sense
as
statues
and
pictures
on
which
labor
has
been
expended
there
is
something
useful
and
even
necessary
besides
food
and
raiment
and
houses
the
gold
which
ornamented
solomon
temple
or
the
minerva
of
phidias
or
the
garments
of
leo
had
a
value
the
ring
which
is
a
present
to
brides
is
a
part
of
a
marriage
ceremony
the
golden
watch
which
never
tarnishes
is
more
valuable
inherently
than
a
pewter
one
because
it
remains
beautiful
thus
when
gold
enters
into
ornaments
deemed
indispensable
or
into
manufactures
which
are
needed
it
has
an
inherent
value
it
is
wealth
but
when
gold
is
a
mere
medium
of
exchange
its
chief
use
then
it
has
only
a
conventional
value
i
mean
it
does
not
make
a
nation
rich
or
poor
since
the
rarer
it
is
the
more
it
will
purchase
of
the
necessaries
of
life
a
pound
weight
of
gold
in
ancient
greece
or
in
mediaeval
europe
would
purchase
as
much
wheat
as
twenty
pounds
weight
will
purchase
if
the
mines
of
mexico
or
peru
or
california
had
never
been
worked
the
gold
in
the
civilized
world
three
hundred
years
ago
would
have
been
as
valuable
for
banking
purposes
or
as
an
exchange
for
agricultural
products
as
twenty
times
its
present
quantity
since
it
would
have
bought
as
much
as
twenty
times
the
quantity
will
buy
make
diamonds
as
plenty
as
crystals
they
would
be
worth
no
more
than
crystals
if
they
were
not
harder
and
more
beautiful
make
gold
as
plenty
as
silver
it
would
be
worth
no
more
than
silver
except
for
manufacturing
purposes
it
would
be
worth
no
more
to
bankers
and
merchants
the
vast
increase
in
the
production
of
the
precious
metals
simply
increased
the
value
of
the
commodities
for
which
they
were
exchanged
a
laborer
can
purchase
no
more
bread
with
a
dollar
than
he
could
with
five
cents
three
hundred
years
ago
five
cents
were
really
as
much
wealth
three
hundred
years
ago
as
a
dollar
is
wherein
then
has
the
increase
in
the
precious
metals
added
to
the
wealth
of
the
world
if
a
twentieth
part
of
the
gold
and
silver
now
in
circulation
would
buy
as
much
land
or
furniture
or
wheat
or
oil
three
hundred
years
ago
as
the
whole
amount
now
used
as
money
will
buy
had
no
gold
or
silver
mines
been
discovered
in
america
the
gold
and
silver
would
have
appreciated
in
value
in
proportion
to
the
wear
of
them
in
other
words
the
scarcer
the
gold
and
silver
the
more
the
same
will
purchase
of
the
fruits
of
human
industry
so
industry
is
the
wealth
not
the
gold
it
is
the
cultivated
farms
and
the
manufactures
and
the
buildings
and
the
internal
improvements
of
a
country
which
constitute
its
real
wealth
since
these
represent
its
industry
the
labor
of
men
mines
indeed
employ
the
labor
of
men
but
they
do
not
furnish
food
for
the
body
or
raiment
to
wear
or
houses
to
live
in
or
fuel
for
cooking
or
any
purpose
whatever
of
human
comfort
or
necessity
only
a
material
for
ornament
which
i
grant
is
wealth
so
far
as
ornament
is
for
the
welfare
of
man
the
marbles
of
ancient
greece
were
very
valuable
for
the
labor
expended
on
them
either
for
architecture
or
for
ornament
gold
and
silver
were
early
selected
as
useful
and
convenient
articles
for
exchange
like
and
so
far
have
inherent
value
as
they
supply
that
necessity
but
if
a
fourth
part
of
the
gold
and
silver
in
existence
would
supply
that
necessity
the
remaining
are
as
inherently
valueless
as
the
paper
on
which
are
printed
their
value
consists
in
what
they
represent
of
the
labors
and
industries
of
men
now
spain
ultimately
became
poor
in
spite
of
the
influx
of
gold
and
silver
from
the
american
mines
because
industries
of
all
kinds
declined
people
were
diverted
from
useful
callings
by
the
mighty
delusion
which
gold
discoveries
created
these
discoveries
had
the
same
effect
on
industry
which
is
the
wealth
of
nations
as
the
support
of
standing
armies
has
in
our
day
they
diverted
men
from
legitimate
callings
the
miners
had
to
be
supported
like
soldiers
and
worse
the
sudden
influx
of
gold
and
silver
intoxicated
men
and
stimulated
speculation
an
army
of
speculators
do
not
enrich
a
nation
since
they
rob
each
other
they
cause
money
to
change
hands
they
do
not
stimulate
industry
they
do
not
create
wealth
they
simply
make
it
flow
from
one
person
to
another
but
speculations
sometimes
create
activity
in
enterprise
they
inflame
desires
for
wealth
and
cause
people
to
make
greater
exertions
in
that
sense
the
discovery
of
american
mines
gave
a
stimulus
to
commerce
and
travel
and
energy
people
rushed
to
america
for
gold
these
people
had
to
be
fed
and
clothed
then
farmers
and
manufacturers
followed
the
they
tilled
the
soil
to
feed
the
miners
the
new
farms
which
dotted
the
region
of
the
added
to
the
wealth
of
the
country
in
which
the
mines
were
located
colonization
followed
but
it
was
america
that
became
enriched
not
the
old
countries
from
which
the
miners
came
except
so
far
as
the
old
countries
furnished
tools
and
ships
and
fabrics
for
doubtless
commerce
and
manufacturing
were
stimulated
so
far
the
wealth
of
the
world
increased
but
the
men
who
returned
to
riot
in
luxury
and
idleness
did
not
stimulate
enterprise
they
made
others
idle
also
the
necessity
of
labor
was
lost
sight
of
and
yet
if
one
country
became
idle
another
country
may
have
become
industrious
there
can
be
but
little
question
that
the
discovery
of
the
american
mines
gave
commerce
and
manufactures
and
agriculture
on
the
whole
a
stimulus
this
was
particularly
seen
in
england
england
grew
rich
from
industry
and
enterprise
as
spain
became
poor
from
idleness
and
luxury
the
silver
and
gold
diffused
throughout
europe
ultimately
found
their
way
into
the
pockets
of
englishmen
who
made
a
market
for
their
manufactures
it
was
not
alone
the
precious
metals
which
enriched
england
but
the
will
and
power
to
produce
those
articles
of
industry
for
which
the
rest
of
the
world
parted
with
their
gold
and
silver
what
has
made
france
rich
since
the
revolution
those
innumerable
articles
of
taste
and
elegance
fabrics
and
wines
for
which
all
europe
parted
with
their
specie
not
war
not
conquest
not
mines
why
till
recently
was
germany
so
poor
because
it
had
so
little
to
sell
to
other
nations
because
industry
was
cramped
by
standing
armies
and
despotic
governments
one
thing
is
certain
that
the
discovery
of
america
opened
a
new
field
for
industry
and
enterprise
to
all
the
discontented
and
impoverished
and
oppressed
europeans
who
emigrated
at
first
they
emigrated
to
dig
silver
and
gold
the
opening
of
mines
required
labor
and
miners
were
obliged
to
part
with
their
gold
for
the
necessaries
of
life
thus
california
in
our
day
has
become
peopled
with
farmers
and
merchants
and
manufacturers
as
well
as
miners
many
came
to
america
expecting
to
find
gold
and
were
disappointed
and
were
obliged
to
turn
agriculturists
as
in
virginia
many
came
to
new
england
from
political
and
religious
motives
but
all
came
to
better
their
fortunes
gradually
the
united
states
and
canada
became
populated
from
east
to
west
and
from
north
to
south
the
surplus
population
of
europe
poured
itself
into
the
wilds
of
america
generally
the
emigrants
were
farmers
with
the
growth
of
agricultural
industry
were
developed
commerce
and
manufactures
thus
materially
the
world
was
immensely
benefited
a
new
continent
was
opened
for
industry
no
matter
what
the
form
of
government
may
be
i
might
almost
say
no
matter
what
the
morals
and
religion
of
the
people
may
be
so
long
as
there
is
land
to
occupy
and
to
be
sold
cheap
the
continent
will
fill
up
and
will
be
as
densely
populated
as
europe
or
asia
because
the
natural
advantages
are
good
the
rivers
and
the
lakes
will
be
navigated
the
products
of
the
country
will
be
exchanged
for
european
and
asiatic
products
wealth
will
certainly
increase
and
increase
indefinitely
there
is
no
calculating
the
future
resources
and
wealth
of
the
new
world
especially
in
the
united
states
there
are
no
conceivable
bounds
to
their
future
commerce
manufactures
and
agricultural
products
we
can
predict
with
certainty
the
rise
of
new
cities
villas
palaces
material
splendor
limited
only
to
the
increasing
resources
and
population
of
the
country
who
can
tell
the
number
of
miles
of
new
railroads
yet
to
be
made
the
new
inventions
to
abridge
human
labor
what
great
empires
are
destined
to
rise
what
unknown
forms
of
luxury
will
be
found
out
what
new
and
magnificent
trophies
of
art
and
science
will
gradually
be
seen
what
mechanism
what
material
glories
are
sure
to
come
this
is
not
speculation
nothing
can
retard
the
growth
of
america
in
material
wealth
and
glory
the
splendid
external
will
call
forth
more
panegyrics
than
the
old
roman
world
which
fancied
itself
eternal
the
tower
of
the
new
babel
will
rise
to
the
clouds
and
be
seen
in
all
its
glory
throughout
the
earth
and
sea
no
fourth
of
july
orator
ever
exaggerated
the
future
destinies
of
america
in
a
material
point
of
view
no
politician
even
conceived
what
will
be
sure
to
come
and
what
then
grant
the
most
indefinite
expansion
the
growth
of
empires
whose
splendor
and
wealth
and
power
shall
utterly
eclipse
the
glories
of
the
old
world
all
this
is
probable
but
when
we
have
dwelt
on
the
future
material
expansion
when
we
have
given
wings
to
imagination
and
feel
that
even
imagination
can
not
reach
the
probable
realities
in
a
material
aspect
then
our
predictions
and
calculations
stop
beyond
material
glories
we
can
not
count
with
certainty
the
world
has
witnessed
many
powerful
empires
which
have
passed
away
and
left
not
a
rack
behind
what
remains
of
the
antediluvian
world
not
even
a
spike
of
noah
ark
larger
and
stronger
than
any
modern
ship
what
remains
of
nineveh
of
babylon
of
thebes
of
tyre
of
carthage
those
great
centres
of
wealth
and
power
what
remains
of
roman
greatness
even
except
in
laws
and
literature
and
renovated
statues
remember
there
is
an
undeviating
uniformity
in
the
past
history
of
nations
what
is
the
simple
story
of
all
the
ages
industry
wealth
corruption
decay
and
ruin
what
conservative
power
has
been
strong
enough
to
arrest
the
ruin
of
the
nations
of
antiquity
have
not
material
forces
and
glories
been
developed
and
exhibited
whatever
the
religion
and
morals
of
the
fallen
nations
can
not
a
country
grow
materially
to
a
certain
point
under
the
most
adverse
influences
in
a
religious
and
moral
point
of
view
yet
for
lack
of
religion
and
morals
the
nations
perished
and
their
were
buried
in
the
dust
they
perished
for
lack
of
true
conservative
forces
at
least
that
is
the
judgment
of
historians
nobody
doubts
the
splendor
of
the
material
glories
of
the
ancient
nations
the
ruins
of
baalbec
of
palmyra
of
athens
prove
this
to
say
nothing
of
history
the
material
glories
of
the
ancient
nations
may
be
surpassed
by
our
modern
wonders
but
yet
all
the
material
glories
of
the
ancient
nations
passed
away
now
if
this
is
to
be
the
destiny
of
america
an
unbounded
material
growth
followed
by
corruption
and
ruin
then
columbus
has
simply
extended
the
realm
for
men
to
try
material
experiments
make
new
york
a
second
carthage
and
boston
a
second
athens
and
philadelphia
a
second
antioch
and
washington
a
second
rome
and
we
simply
repeat
the
old
experiments
did
not
the
romans
have
nearly
all
we
have
materially
except
our
modern
scientific
inventions
but
has
america
no
higher
destiny
than
to
repeat
the
old
experiments
and
improve
upon
them
and
become
rich
and
powerful
has
she
no
higher
and
nobler
mission
can
she
lay
hold
of
forces
that
the
old
world
never
had
such
as
will
prevent
the
uniform
doom
of
nations
i
maintain
that
there
is
no
reason
that
can
be
urged
based
on
history
and
experience
why
she
should
escape
the
fate
of
the
nations
of
antiquity
unless
new
forces
arise
on
this
continent
different
from
what
the
world
has
known
and
which
have
a
conservative
influence
if
america
has
a
great
mission
to
declare
and
to
fulfil
she
must
put
forth
altogether
new
forces
and
these
not
material
and
these
alone
will
save
her
and
save
the
world
it
is
mournful
to
contemplate
even
the
future
magnificent
material
glories
of
america
if
these
are
not
to
be
preserved
if
these
are
to
share
the
fate
of
ancient
wonders
it
is
obvious
that
the
real
glory
of
america
is
to
be
something
entirely
different
from
that
of
which
the
ancients
boasted
and
this
is
to
be
moral
and
spiritual
that
which
the
ancients
lacked
this
leads
me
to
speak
of
the
moral
consequences
of
the
discovery
of
america
infinitely
grander
than
any
material
wonders
of
which
the
world
has
been
full
of
which
every
form
of
paganism
has
boasted
which
nearly
everywhere
has
perished
and
which
must
necessarily
perish
everywhere
without
new
forces
to
preserve
them
in
a
moral
point
of
view
scarcely
anything
good
immediately
resulted
at
least
to
europe
by
the
discovery
of
america
it
excited
the
wildest
spirit
of
adventure
the
most
unscrupulous
cupidity
the
most
demoralizing
speculation
it
created
jealousies
and
wars
the
cruelties
and
injustices
inflicted
on
the
indians
were
revolting
nothing
in
the
annals
of
the
world
exceeds
the
wickedness
of
the
spaniards
in
the
conquest
of
peru
and
mexico
that
conquest
is
the
most
dismal
and
least
glorious
in
human
history
we
see
in
it
no
poetry
or
heroism
or
necessity
we
read
of
nothing
but
its
crimes
the
jesuits
in
their
missionary
zeal
partly
redeemed
the
cruelties
but
they
soon
imposed
a
despotic
yoke
and
made
their
religion
pay
monopolies
scandalously
increased
and
the
new
world
was
regarded
only
as
spoil
the
tone
of
moral
feeling
was
lowered
everywhere
for
the
nations
were
crazed
with
the
hope
of
sudden
accumulations
spain
became
enervated
and
demoralized
on
america
itself
the
demoralization
was
even
more
marked
there
never
was
such
a
state
of
moral
degradation
in
any
christian
country
as
in
south
america
three
centuries
have
passed
and
the
low
state
of
morals
continues
contrast
mexico
and
peru
with
the
united
states
morally
and
intellectually
what
seeds
of
vice
did
not
the
spaniards
plant
how
the
old
natives
melted
away
and
then
to
add
to
the
moral
evils
attending
colonization
was
the
introduction
of
african
slaves
especially
in
the
west
indies
and
the
southern
states
of
north
america
christendom
seems
to
have
lost
the
sense
of
morality
slavery
more
than
counterbalances
all
other
advantages
together
it
was
the
stain
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
not
merely
slaves
but
the
increase
the
horrors
of
the
frightful
picture
america
became
associated
in
the
minds
of
europeans
with
slavery
and
cruelty
to
indians
better
that
the
country
had
remained
undiscovered
than
that
such
vices
and
miseries
should
be
introduced
into
the
most
fertile
parts
of
the
new
world
i
can
not
see
that
civilization
gained
anything
morally
by
the
discovery
of
america
until
the
new
settlers
were
animated
by
other
motives
than
a
desire
for
sudden
wealth
when
the
country
became
colonized
by
men
who
sought
liberty
to
worship
god
men
of
lofty
purposes
willing
to
undergo
sufferings
and
danger
in
order
to
plant
the
seeds
of
a
higher
civilization
then
there
arose
new
forms
of
social
and
political
life
such
men
were
those
who
colonized
new
england
and
say
what
you
will
in
spite
of
all
the
disagreeable
sides
of
the
puritan
character
it
was
the
puritans
who
gave
a
new
impulse
to
civilization
in
its
higher
sense
they
founded
schools
and
colleges
and
churches
they
introduced
a
new
form
of
political
life
by
their
in
which
liberty
was
nurtured
and
all
local
improvements
were
regulated
it
was
the
autonomy
of
towns
on
which
the
political
structure
of
new
england
rested
in
them
was
born
that
true
representative
government
which
has
gradually
spread
towards
the
west
the
colonies
were
embryo
states
states
afterwards
to
be
bound
together
by
a
stronger
tie
than
that
of
a
league
the
new
england
states
after
the
war
of
independence
were
the
defenders
and
advocates
of
a
federal
and
central
power
an
entirely
new
political
organization
was
gradually
formed
resting
equally
on
such
pillars
as
independent
townships
and
independent
states
and
these
represented
by
delegates
in
a
national
centre
so
we
believe
america
was
discovered
not
so
much
to
furnish
a
field
for
indefinite
material
expansion
with
european
arts
and
fashions
which
would
simply
assimilate
america
to
the
old
world
with
all
its
dangers
and
vices
and
follies
but
to
introduce
new
forms
of
government
new
social
institutions
new
customs
and
manners
new
experiments
in
liberty
new
religious
organizations
new
modes
to
ameliorate
the
necessary
evils
of
life
it
was
discovered
that
men
might
labor
and
enjoy
the
fruits
of
industry
in
a
new
mode
unfettered
by
the
restraints
which
the
institutions
of
europe
imposed
america
is
a
new
field
in
which
to
try
experiments
in
government
and
social
life
which
can
not
be
tried
in
the
older
nations
without
sweeping
and
dangerous
revolutions
and
new
institutions
have
arisen
which
are
our
pride
and
boast
and
which
are
the
wonder
and
admiration
of
europe
america
is
the
only
country
under
the
sun
in
which
there
is
a
government
which
purely
represents
the
wishes
of
the
people
where
universal
suffrage
is
not
a
mockery
and
if
america
has
a
destiny
to
fulfil
for
other
nations
she
must
give
them
something
more
valuable
than
reaping
machines
palace
cars
and
horse
railroads
she
must
give
not
only
machinery
to
abridge
labor
but
institutions
and
ideas
to
expand
the
mind
and
elevate
the
soul
something
by
which
the
poor
can
rise
and
assert
their
rights
unless
something
is
developed
here
which
can
not
be
developed
in
other
countries
in
the
way
of
new
spiritual
and
intellectual
forces
which
have
a
conservative
influence
then
i
can
not
see
how
america
can
long
continue
to
be
the
home
and
refuge
of
the
poor
and
miserable
of
other
lands
a
new
and
better
spirit
must
vivify
schools
and
colleges
and
philanthropic
enterprises
than
that
which
has
prevailed
in
older
nations
unless
something
new
is
born
here
which
has
a
peculiar
power
to
save
wherein
will
america
ultimately
differ
from
other
parts
of
christendom
we
must
have
schools
in
which
the
heart
as
well
as
the
brain
is
educated
and
newspapers
which
aspire
to
something
higher
than
to
fan
prejudices
and
appeal
to
perverted
tastes
our
hope
is
not
in
books
which
teach
infidelity
under
the
name
of
science
nor
in
pulpits
which
can
not
be
sustained
without
sensational
oratory
nor
in
journals
which
trade
on
the
religious
sentiments
of
the
people
nor
in
books
which
are
an
insult
to
the
human
understanding
nor
in
colleges
which
fit
youth
merely
for
making
money
nor
in
schools
of
technology
to
give
an
impulse
to
material
interests
nor
in
legislatures
controlled
by
monopolists
nor
in
judges
elected
by
demagogues
nor
in
philanthropic
societies
to
ventilate
unpractical
theories
these
will
neither
renovate
nor
conserve
what
is
most
precious
in
life
unless
a
nation
grows
morally
as
well
as
materially
there
is
something
wrong
at
the
core
of
society
as
i
have
said
no
material
expansion
will
avail
if
society
becomes
rotten
at
the
core
america
is
a
glorious
boon
to
civilization
but
only
as
she
fulfils
a
new
mission
in
history
not
to
become
more
potent
in
material
forces
but
in
those
spiritual
agencies
which
prevent
corruption
and
decay
an
infidel
professor
calling
himself
a
savant
may
tell
you
that
there
is
nothing
certain
or
great
but
in
the
direction
of
science
to
utilities
even
as
he
may
glory
in
a
philosophy
which
ignores
a
creator
and
takes
cognizance
only
of
a
creation
as
i
survey
the
growing
and
enormous
moral
evils
which
degrade
society
here
as
everywhere
in
spite
of
bunker
hills
and
plymouth
rocks
and
all
the
windy
declamations
of
politicians
and
philanthropists
and
all
the
advance
in
useful
mechanisms
i
am
sometimes
tempted
to
propound
inquiries
which
suggest
the
old
mournful
story
of
the
decline
and
ruin
of
states
and
empires
i
ask
myself
why
should
america
be
an
exception
to
the
uniform
fate
of
nations
as
history
has
demonstrated
why
should
not
good
institutions
be
perverted
here
as
in
all
other
countries
and
ages
of
the
world
where
has
civilization
shown
any
striking
triumphs
except
in
inventions
to
abridge
the
labors
of
mankind
and
make
men
comfortable
and
rich
is
there
nothing
before
us
then
but
the
triumphs
of
material
life
to
end
as
mournfully
as
the
materialism
of
antiquity
if
so
then
christianity
is
a
most
dismal
failure
is
a
defeated
power
like
all
other
forms
of
religion
which
failed
to
save
but
is
it
a
failure
are
we
really
swinging
back
to
paganism
is
the
time
to
be
hailed
when
all
religions
will
be
considered
by
the
philosopher
as
equally
false
and
equally
useful
is
there
nothing
more
cheerful
for
us
to
contemplate
than
what
the
old
pagan
philosophy
holds
out
man
destined
to
live
like
brutes
or
butterflies
and
pass
away
into
the
infinity
of
time
and
space
like
inert
matter
decomposed
absorbed
and
entering
into
new
and
everlasting
combinations
is
america
to
become
like
europe
and
asia
in
all
essential
elements
of
life
has
she
no
other
mission
than
to
add
to
perishable
glories
is
she
to
teach
the
world
nothing
new
in
education
and
philanthropy
and
government
are
all
her
struggles
in
behalf
of
liberty
in
vain
we
all
know
that
christianity
is
the
only
hope
of
the
world
the
question
is
whether
america
is
or
is
not
more
favorable
for
its
healthy
developments
and
applications
than
the
other
countries
of
christendom
are
we
believe
that
it
is
if
it
is
not
then
america
is
only
a
new
field
for
the
spread
and
triumph
of
material
forces
if
it
is
we
may
look
forward
to
such
improvements
in
education
in
political
institutions
in
social
life
in
religious
organizations
in
philanthropical
enterprise
that
the
country
will
be
sought
by
the
poor
and
enslaved
classes
of
europe
more
for
its
moral
and
intellectual
advantages
than
for
its
mines
or
farms
the
objects
of
the
puritan
settlers
will
be
gained
and
the
grandeur
of
the
discovery
of
a

will
be

savonarola
unsuccessful
reforms
this
lecture
is
intended
to
set
forth
a
memorable
movement
in
the
roman
catholic
church
a
reformation
of
morals
preceding
the
greater
movement
of
luther
to
produce
a
reformation
of
both
morals
and
doctrines
as
the
representative
of
this
movement
i
take
savonarola
concerning
whom
much
has
of
late
been
written
more
i
think
because
he
was
a
florentine
in
a
remarkable
age
the
age
of
artists
and
of
reviving
literature
than
because
he
was
a
martyr
battling
with
evils
which
no
one
man
was
capable
of
removing
his
life
was
more
a
protest
than
a
victory
he
was
an
unsuccessful
reformer
and
yet
he
prepared
the
way
for
that
religious
revival
which
afterward
took
place
in
the
catholic
church
itself
his
spirit
was
not
revolutionary
like
that
of
the
saxon
monk
and
yet
it
was
progressive
his
soul
was
in
active
sympathy
with
every
emancipating
idea
of
his
age
he
was
the
incarnation
of
a
fervid
living
active
piety
amid
forms
and
formulas
a
fearless
exposer
of
all
shams
an
uncompromising
enemy
to
the
blended
atheism
and
idolatry
of
his
ungodly
age
he
was
the
contemporary
of
political
worldly
warlike
unscrupulous
popes
disgraced
by
nepotism
and
personal
vices
men
who
aimed
to
extend
not
a
spiritual
but
temporal
dominion
and
who
scandalized
the
highest
position
in
the
christian
world
as
attested
by
all
reliable
historians
whether
catholic
or
protestant
however
infallible
the
catholic
church
claims
to
be
it
has
never
been
denied
that
some
of
her
highest
dignitaries
have
been
subject
to
grave
reproaches
both
in
their
character
and
their
influence
such
men
were
sixtus
julius
and
alexander
able
probably
for
it
is
very
seldom
that
the
popes
have
not
been
distinguished
for
something
but
men
nevertheless
who
were
a
disgrace
to
the
superb
position
they
had
succeeded
in
reaching
the
great
feature
of
that
age
was
the
revival
of
classical
learning
and
artistic
triumphs
in
sculpture
painting
and
architecture
blended
with
infidel
levity
and
social
corruptions
so
that
it
is
both
interesting
and
hideous
it
is
interesting
for
its
triumphs
of
genius
its
dispersion
of
the
shadows
of
the
middle
ages
the
commencement
of
great
enterprises
and
of
a
marked
refinement
of
manners
and
tastes
it
is
hideous
for
its
venalities
its
murders
its
debaucheries
its
unblushing
wickedness
and
its
disgraceful
levities
when
god
and
duty
and
were
alike
ignored
cruel
tyrants
reigned
in
cities
and
rapacious
priests
fattened
on
the
credulity
of
the
people
think
of
monks
itinerating
europe
to
sell
indulgences
for
sin
of
monasteries
and
convents
filled
not
with
sublime
enthusiasts
as
in
earlier
times
but
with
gluttons
and
sensualists
living
in
concubinage
and
greedy
of
the
very
things
which
primitive
monasticism
denounced
and
abhorred
think
of
boys
elevated
to
episcopal
thrones
and
the
sons
of
popes
made
cardinals
and
princes
think
of
churches
desecrated
by
spectacles
which
were
demoralizing
and
a
worship
of
saints
and
images
which
had
become
idolatrous
a
degrading
superstition
among
the
people
an
infidel
apathy
among
the
higher
classes
not
infidel
speculations
for
these
were
reserved
for
more
enlightened
times
but
an
indifference
to
what
is
ennobling
to
all
vital
religion
worthy
of
the
sophists
in
the
time
of
socrates
it
was
in
this
age
of
religious
apathy
and
scandalous
vices
yet
of
awakening
intelligence
and
artistic
glories
when
the
greatest
enthusiasm
was
manifested
for
the
revived
literature
and
sculptured
marbles
of
classic
greece
and
rome
that
savonarola
appeared
in
florence
as
a
reformer
and
preacher
and
statesman
near
the
close
of
the
fifteenth
century
when
columbus
was
seeking
a
western
passage
to
india
when
michael
angelo
was
moulding
the
battle
of
hercules
with
the
centaurs
when
ficino
was
teaching
the
philosophy
of
plato
when
alexander
vi
was
making
princes
of
his
natural
children
when
bramante
was
making
plans
for
a
new
peter
when
cardinal
bembo
was
writing
latin
essays
when
lorenzo
de
medici
was
the
flattered
patron
of
both
scholars
and
artists
and
the
city
over
which
he
ruled
with
so
much
magnificence
was
the
most
attractive
place
in
europe
next
to
that
other
city
on
the
banks
of
the
tiber
whose
wonders
and
glories
have
never
been
exhausted
and
will
probably
survive
the
revolutions
of
unknown
empires
but
savonarola
was
not
a
native
of
florence
he
was
born
in
the
year
at
ferrara
belonged
to
a
good
family
and
received
an
expensive
education
being
destined
to
the
profession
of
medicine
he
was
a
sad
solitary
pensive
but
precocious
young
man
whose
youth
was
marked
by
an
unfortunate
attachment
to
a
haughty
florentine
girl
he
did
not
cherish
her
memory
and
dedicate
to
her
a
like
dante
but
became
very
dejected
and
very
pious
his
piety
assumed
of
course
the
ascetic
type
for
there
was
scarcely
any
other
in
that
age
and
he
entered
a
dominican
convent
as
luther
a
few
years
later
entered
an
augustinian
but
he
was
not
an
original
genius
or
a
bold
and
independent
thinker
like
luther
so
he
was
not
emancipated
from
the
ideas
of
his
age
how
few
men
can
go
counter
to
prevailing
ideas
it
takes
a
prodigious
genius
and
a
fearless
inquiring
mind
to
break
away
from
their
bondage
abraham
could
renounce
the
idolatries
which
surrounded
him
when
called
by
a
supernatural
voice
paul
could
give
up
the
phariseeism
in
the
jewish
schools
and
synagogues
when
stricken
blind
by
the
hand
of
god
luther
could
break
away
from
monastic
rules
and
papal
denunciation
when
taught
by
the
bible
the
true
ground
of
justification
but
savonarola
could
not
he
pursued
the
path
to
heaven
in
the
beaten
track
after
the
fashion
of
jerome
and
bernard
and
thomas
aquinas
after
the
style
of
the
middle
ages
and
was
sincere
devout
and
lofty
like
the
saints
of
the
fifth
century
and
read
his
bible
as
they
did
and
essayed
a
high
religious
life
but
he
was
stern
gloomy
and
austere
emaciated
by
fasts
and
he
had
however
those
passive
virtues
which
mediaeval
piety
ever
enjoined
yea
which
christ
himself
preached
upon
the
mount
and
which
protestantism
in
the
arrogance
of
reason
is
in
danger
of
losing
sight
of
humility
submission
and
contempt
of
material
gains
he
won
the
admiration
of
his
superiors
for
his
attainments
and
his
piety
being
equally
versed
in
aristotle
and
the
holy
scriptures
he
delighted
most
in
the
old
testament
heroes
and
prophets
and
caught
their
sternness
and
invective
he
was
not
so
much
interested
in
dogmas
as
he
was
in
morals
he
had
not
indeed
a
turn
of
mind
for
theology
like
anselm
and
calvin
but
he
took
a
practical
view
of
the
evils
of
society
at
thirty
years
of
age
he
began
to
preach
in
ferrara
and
florence
but
was
not
very
successful
his
sermons
at
first
created
but
little
interest
and
he
sometimes
preached
to
as
few
as
people
probably
he
was
too
rough
and
vehement
to
suit
the
fastidious
ears
of
the
most
refined
city
in
italy
people
will
not
ordinarily
bear
uncouthness
from
preachers
however
gifted
until
they
have
earned
a
reputation
they
prefer
pretty
and
polished
young
men
with
nothing
but
platitudes
or
extravagances
to
utter
savonarola
seems
to
have
been
discouraged
and
humiliated
at
his
failure
and
was
sent
to
preach
to
the
rustic
villagers
amid
the
mountains
near
sienna
among
these
people
he
probably
felt
more
at
home
and
he
gave
vent
to
the
fire
within
him
and
electrified
all
who
heard
him
winning
even
the
admiration
of
the
celebrated
prince
of
mirandola
from
this
time
his
fame
spread
rapidly
he
was
recalled
to
florence
and
his
great
career
commenced
in
the
following
year
such
crowds
pressed
to
hear
him
that
the
church
of
mark
connected
with
the
dominican
convent
to
which
he
was
attached
could
not
contain
the
people
and
he
repaired
to
the
cathedral
and
even
that
spacious
church
was
filled
with
eager
listeners
more
moved
than
delighted
so
great
was
his
popularity
that
his
influence
correspondingly
increased
and
he
was
chosen
prior
of
his
famous
convent
he
now
wielded
power
as
well
as
influence
and
became
the
most
marked
man
of
the
city
he
was
not
only
the
most
eloquent
preacher
in
italy
probably
in
the
world
but
his
eloquence
was
marked
by
boldness
earnestness
almost
fierceness
like
an
ancient
prophet
he
was
terrible
in
his
denunciation
of
vices
he
spared
no
one
and
he
feared
no
one
he
resembled
chrysostom
at
constantinople
when
he
denounced
the
vanity
of
eudoxia
and
the
venality
of
eutropius
lorenzo
de
medici
the
absolute
lord
of
florence
sent
for
him
and
expostulated
and
remonstrated
with
the
unsparing
preacher
all
to
no
effect
and
when
the
usurper
of
his
country
liberties
was
dying
the
preacher
was
again
sent
for
this
time
to
grant
an
absolution
but
savonarola
would
grant
no
absolution
unless
lorenzo
would
restore
the
liberties
which
he
and
his
family
had
taken
away
the
dying
tyrant
was
not
prepared
to
accede
to
so
haughty
a
demand
and
collecting
his
strength
rolled
over
on
his
bed
without
saying
a
word
and
the
austere
monk
wended
his
way
back
to
his
convent
unmolested
and
determined
the
premature
death
of
this
magnificent
prince
made
a
great
sensation
throughout
italy
and
produced
a
change
in
the
politics
of
florence
for
the
people
began
to
see
their
political
degradation
the
popular
discontents
were
increased
when
his
successor
pietro
proved
himself
incapable
and
tyrannical
abandoned
himself
to
orgies
and
insulted
the
leading
citizens
by
an
overwhelming
pride
savonarola
took
the
side
of
the
people
and
fanned
the
discontents
he
became
the
recognized
leader
of
opposition
to
the
medici
and
virtually
ruled
the
city
the
prior
of
mark
now
appeared
in
a
double
light
as
a
political
leader
and
as
a
popular
preacher
let
us
first
consider
him
in
his
secular
aspect
as
a
revolutionist
and
statesman
for
the
admirable
constitution
he
had
a
principal
hand
in
framing
entitles
him
to
the
dignity
of
statesman
rather
than
politician
if
his
cause
had
not
been
good
and
if
he
had
not
appealed
to
both
enlightened
and
patriotic
sentiments
he
would
have
been

a
demagogue

and
a
clerical
demagogue
is
hideous
savonarola
began
his
political
career
with
terrible
denunciations
from
his
cathedral
pulpit
of
the
political
evils
of
his
day
not
merely
in
florence
but
throughout
italy
he
detested
tyrants
and
usurpers
and
sought
to
conserve
such
liberties
as
the
florentines
had
once
enjoyed
he
was
not
only
the
preacher
he
was
also
the
patriot
things
temporal
were
mixed
up
with
things
spiritual
in
his
discourses
in
his
detestation
of
the
tyranny
of
the
medici
and
his
zeal
to
recover
for
the
florentines
their
lost
liberties
he
even
hailed
the
french
armies
of
charles
viii
as
deliverers
although
they
had
crossed
the
alps
to
invade
and
conquer
italy
if
the
gates
of
florence
were
open
to
them
they
would
expel
the
medici
so
he
stimulated
the
people
to
league
with
foreign
enemies
in
order
to
recover
their
liberties
this
would
have
been
high
treason
in
richelieu
time
as
when
the
huguenots
encouraged
the
invasion
of
the
english
on
the
soil
of
france
savonarola
was
a
zealot
and
carried
the
same
spirit
into
politics
that
he
did
into
religion
such
as
when
he
made
a
bonfire
of
what
he
called
vanities
he
had
an
end
to
carry
he
would
use
any
means
there
is
apt
to
be
a
spirit
of
jesuitism
in
all
men
consumed
with
zeal
determined
on
success
to
the
eye
of
the
florentine
reformer
the
expulsion
of
the
medici
seemed
the
supremest
necessity
and
if
it
could
be
done
in
no
other
way
than
by
opening
the
gates
of
his
city
to
the
french
invaders
he
would
open
the
gates
whatever
he
commanded
from
the
pulpit
was
done
by
the
people
for
he
seemed
to
have
supreme
control
over
them
gained
by
his
eloquence
as
a
preacher
but
he
did
not
abuse
his
power
when
the
medici
were
expelled
he
prevented
violence
blood
did
not
flow
in
the
streets
order
and
law
were
preserved
the
people
looked
up
to
him
as
their
leader
temporal
as
well
as
spiritual
so
he
assembled
them
in
the
great
hall
of
the
city
where
they
formally
held
a
and
reinstated
the
ancient
magistrates
but
these
were
men
without
experience
they
had
no
capacity
to
govern
and
they
were
selected
without
wisdom
on
the
part
of
the
people
the
people
in
fact
had
not
the
ability
to
select
their
best
and
wisest
men
for
rulers
that
is
an
evil
inherent
in
all
popular
governments
does
san
francisco
or
new
york
send
its
greatest
men
to
congress
do
not
our
cities
elect
such
rulers
as
the
demagogues
point
out
do
not
the
few
rule
even
in
a
congregational
church
if
some
commanding
genius
unscrupulous
or
wise
or
eloquent
or
full
of
tricks
controls
elections
with
us
much
more
easily
could
such
a
man
as
savonarola
rule
in
florence
where
there
were
no
political
organizations
no
caucuses
no
wirepullers
no
other
man
of
commanding
ability
the
only
was
this
preacher
who
indicated
the
general
policy
to
be
pursued
he
left
elections
to
the
people
and
when
these
proved
a
failure
a
new
constitution
became
a
necessity
but
where
were
the
men
capable
of
framing
a
constitution
for
the
republic
two
generations
of
political
slavery
had
destroyed
political
experience
the
citizens
were
as
incapable
of
framing
a
new
constitution
as
the
legislators
of
france
after
they
had
decimated
the
nobility
confiscated
the
church
lands
and
cut
off
the
head
of
the
king
the
lawyers
disputed
in
the
town
hall
but
accomplished
nothing
their
science
amounted
only
to
an
analysis
of
human
passion
all
wanted
a
government
entirely
free
from
tyranny
all
expected
impossibilities
some
were
in
favor
of
a
venetian
aristocracy
and
others
of
a
pure
democracy
yet
none
would
yield
to
compromise
without
which
no
permanent
political
institution
can
ever
be
framed
how
could
the
inexperienced
citizens
of
florence
comprehend
the
complicated
relations
of
governments
to
make
a
constitution
that
the
world
respects
requires
the
highest
maturity
of
human
wisdom
it
is
the
supremest
labor
of
great
men
it
took
the
ablest
man
ever
born
among
the
jews
to
give
to
them
a
national
polity
the
roman
constitution
was
the
fruit
of
five
hundred
years
experience
our
constitution
was
made
by
the
wisest
most
dignified
most
enlightened
body
of
statesmen
that
this
country
has
yet
seen
and
even
they
could
not
have
made
it
without
great
mutual
concessions
no
man
could
have
made
a
constitution
however
great
his
talents
and
experience
not
even
a
jefferson
or
a
hamilton
which
the
nation
would
have
accepted
it
would
have
been
as
full
of
defects
as
the
legislation
of
solon
or
lycurgus
or
the
abbé
sieyès
but
one
man
gave
a
constitution
to
the
florentines
which
they
not
only
accepted
but
which
has
been
generally
admired
for
its
wisdom
and
that
man
was
our
dominican
monk
the
hand
he
had
in
shaping
that
constitution
not
only
proved
him
to
have
been
a
man
of
great
wisdom
but
entitled
him
to
the
gratitude
of
his
countrymen
as
a
benefactor
he
saw
the
vanity
of
political
science
as
it
then
existed
the
incapacity
of
popular
leaders
and
the
sadness
of
a
people
drifting
into
anarchy
and
confusion
and
strong
in
his
own
will
and
his
sense
of
right
he
rose
superior
to
himself
and
directed
the
stormy
elements
of
passion
and
fear
and
this
he
did
by
his
sermons
from
the
pulpit
for
he
did
not
descend
in
person
into
the
stormy
arena
of
contending
passions
and
interests
he
did
not
himself
attend
the
deliberations
in
the
town
hall
he
was
too
wise
and
dignified
a
man
for
that
but
he
preached
those
principles
and
measures
which
he
wished
to
see
adopted
and
so
great
was
the
reverence
for
him
that
the
people
listened
to
his
instructions
and
afterward
deliberated
and
acted
among
themselves
he
did
not
write
out
a
code
but
he
told
the
people
what
they
should
put
into
it
he
was
the
animating
genius
of
the
city
his
voice
was
obeyed
he
unfolded
the
theory
that
the
government
of
one
man
in
their
circumstances
would
become
tyrannical
and
he
taught
the
doctrine
then
new
that
the
people
were
the
only
source
of
power
that
they
alone
had
the
right
to
elect
their
magistrates
he
therefore
recommended
a
general
government
which
should
include
all
citizens
who
had
intelligence
experience
and
position
not
all
the
people
but
such
as
had
been
magistrates
or
their
fathers
before
them
accordingly
a
grand
council
was
formed
of
three
thousand
citizens
out
of
a
population
of
ninety
thousand
who
had
reached
the
age
of
these
three
thousand
citizens
were
divided
into
three
equal
bodies
each
of
which
should
constitute
a
council
for
six
months
and
no
meeting
was
legal
unless
of
the
members
were
present
this
grand
council
appointed
the
magistrates
but
another
council
was
also
recommended
and
adopted
of
only
eighty
citizens
not
under
forty
years
of
age
picked
men
to
be
changed
every
six
months
whom
the
magistrates
were
bound
to
consult
weekly
and
to
whom
was
confided
the
appointment
of
some
of
the
higher
officers
of
the
state
like
ambassadors
to
neighboring
states
all
laws
proposed
by
the
magistrates
or
seigniory
had
to
be
ratified
by
this
higher
and
selecter
council
the
higher
council
was
a
sort
of
senate
the
lower
council
were
more
like
representatives
but
there
was
no
universal
suffrage
the
clerical
legislator
knew
well
enough
that
only
the
better
and
more
intelligent
part
of
the
people
were
fit
to
vote
even
in
the
election
of
magistrates
he
seems
to
have
foreseen
the
fatal
rock
on
which
all
popular
institutions
are
in
danger
of
being
wrecked
that
no
government
is
safe
and
respected
when
the
people
who
make
it
are
ignorant
and
lawless
so
the
constitution
which
savonarola
gave
was
neither
aristocratic
nor
democratic
it
resembled
that
of
venice
more
than
that
of
athens
that
of
england
more
than
that
of
the
united
states
strictly
universal
suffrage
is
a
utopian
dream
wherever
a
majority
of
the
people
are
wicked
and
degraded
sooner
or
later
it
threatens
to
plunge
any
nation
as
nations
now
are
into
a
whirlpool
of
dangers
even
if
divine
providence
may
not
permit
a
nation
to
be
stranded
and
wrecked
altogether
in
the
politics
of
savonarola
we
see
great
wisdom
and
yet
great
sympathy
for
freedom
he
would
give
the
people
all
that
they
were
fit
for
he
would
make
all
offices
elective
but
only
by
the
suffrages
of
the
better
part
of
the
people
but
the
prior
of
mark
did
not
confine
himself
to
constitutional
questions
and
issues
alone
he
would
remove
all
political
abuses
he
would
tax
property
and
put
an
end
to
forced
loans
and
arbitrary
imposts
he
would
bring
about
a
general
pacification
and
grant
a
general
amnesty
for
political
offences
he
would
guard
against
the
extortions
of
the
rich
and
the
usury
of
the
jews
who
lent
money
at
per
cent
with
compound
interest
he
secured
the
establishment
of
a
bank
for
charitable
loans
he
sought
to
make
the
people
good
citizens
and
to
advance
their
temporal
as
well
as
spiritual
interests
all
his
reforms
political
or
social
were
advocated
however
from
the
pulpit
so
that
he
was
doubtless
a
political
priest
we
in
this
country
and
in
these
times
have
no
very
great
liking
to
this
union
of
spiritual
and
temporal
authority
we
would
separate
and
divide
this
authority
protestants
would
make
the
functions
of
the
ruler
and
the
priest
forever
distinct
but
at
that
time
the
popes
themselves
were
secular
rulers
as
well
as
spiritual
dignitaries
all
bishops
and
abbots
had
the
charge
of
political
interests
courts
of
law
were
presided
over
by
priests
priests
were
ambassadors
to
foreign
powers
they
were
ministers
of
kings
they
had
the
control
of
innumerable
secular
affairs
now
intrusted
to
laymen
so
their
interference
with
politics
did
not
shock
the
people
of
florence
or
the
opinions
of
the
age
it
was
indeed
imperatively
called
for
since
the
clergy
were
the
most
learned
and
influential
men
of
those
times
even
in
affairs
of
state
i
doubt
if
the
catholic
church
has
ever
abrogated
or
ignored
her
old
right
to
meddle
in
the
politics
of
a
state
or
nation
i
do
not
know
but
apprehend
that
the
catholic
clergy
even
in
this
country
take
it
upon
themselves
to
instruct
the
people
in
their
political
duties
no
enlightened
protestant
congregation
would
endure
this
interference
no
protestant
minister
dares
ever
to
discuss
direct
political
issues
from
the
pulpit
except
perhaps
on
thanksgiving
day
or
in
some
rare
exigency
in
public
affairs
still
less
would
he
venture
to
tell
his
parishioners
how
they
should
vote
in
in
imitation
of
ancient
saints
and
apostles
he
is
wisely
constrained
from
interference
in
secular
and
political
affairs
but
in
the
middle
ages
and
the
catholic
church
the
priest
could
be
political
in
his
preaching
since
many
of
his
duties
were
secular
savonarola
usurped
no
prerogatives
he
refrained
from
meeting
men
in
secular
vocations
even
in
his
politics
he
confined
himself
to
his
sphere
in
the
pulpit
he
did
not
attend
the
public
debates
he
simply
preached
he
ruled
by
wisdom
eloquence
and
sanctity
and
as
he
was
an
oracle
his
utterances
became
a
law
but
while
he
instructed
the
people
in
political
duties
he
paid
far
more
attention
to
public
morals
he
would
break
up
luxury
extravagance
ostentatious
living
unseemly
dresses
in
the
house
of
god
he
was
the
foe
of
all
levities
all
frivolities
all
insidious
pleasures
bad
men
found
no
favor
in
his
eyes
and
he
exposed
their
hypocrisies
and
crimes
he
denounced
sin
in
high
places
and
low
he
did
not
confine
himself
to
the
sins
of
his
own
people
alone
but
censured
those
of
princes
and
of
other
cities
he
embraced
all
italy
in
his
glance
he
invoked
the
lord
to
take
the
church
out
of
the
hands
of
the
devil
to
pour
out
his
wrath
on
guilty
cities
he
throws
down
a
gauntlet
of
defiance
to
all
corrupt
potentates
he
predicts
the
near
approach
of
calamities
he
foretells
the
certainty
of
divine
judgment
upon
all
sin
he
clothes
himself
with
the
thunders
of
the
jewish
prophets
he
seems
to
invoke
woe
desolation
and
destruction
he
ascribes
the
very
invasion
of
the
french
to
the
justice
of
retribution
thy
crimes
o
florence
thy
crimes
o
rome
thy
crimes
o
italy
are
the
causes
of
these
chastisements
and
so
terrible
are
his
denunciations
that
the
whole
city
quakes
with
fear
mirandola
relates
that
as
savonarola
voice
sounded
like
a
clap
of
thunder
in
the
cathedral
packed
to
its
utmost
capacity
with
the
trembling
people
a
cold
shiver
ran
through
all
his
bones
and
the
hairs
of
his
head
stood
on
end
o
rome
exclaimed
the
preacher
thou
shalt
be
put
to
the
sword
since
thou
wilt
not
be
converted
o
italy
confusion
upon
confusion
shall
overtake
thee
the
confusion
of
war
shall
follow
thy
sins
and
famine
and
pestilence
shall
follow
after
war
then
he
denounces
rome
o
harlot
church
thou
hast
made
thy
deformity
apparent
to
all
the
world
thou
hast
multiplied
thy
fornications
in
italy
in
france
in
spain
in
every
country
behold
saith
the
lord
i
will
stretch
forth
my
hand
upon
thee
i
will
deliver
thee
into
the
hands
of
those
that
hate
thee
the
burden
of
his
soul
is
sin
sin
everywhere
even
in
the
bosom
of
the
church
and
the
necessity
of
repentance
of
turning
to
the
lord
he
is
more
than
an
elijah
he
is
a
john
the
baptist
his
sermons
are
chiefly
drawn
from
the
old
testament
especially
from
the
prophets
in
their
denunciation
of
woes
like
them
he
is
stern
awful
sublime
he
does
not
attack
the
polity
or
the
constitution
of
the
church
but
its
corruptions
he
does
not
call
the
pope
a
usurper
a
fraud
an
impostor
he
does
not
attack
the
office
but
if
the
pope
is
a
bad
man
he
denounces
his
crimes
he
is
still
the
dominican
monk
owning
his
allegiance
but
demanding
the
reformation
of
the
head
of
the
church
to
whom
god
has
given
the
keys
of
saint
peter
neither
does
he
meddle
with
the
doctrines
of
the
church
he
does
not
take
much
interest
in
dogmas
he
is
not
a
theologian
but
he
would
change
the
habits
and
manners
of
the
people
of
florence
he
would
urge
throughout
italy
a
reformation
of
morals
he
sees
only
the
degeneracy
in
life
he
threatens
eternal
penalties
if
sin
be
persisted
in
he
alarms
the
fears
of
the
people
so
that
women
part
with
their
ornaments
dress
with
more
simplicity
and
walk
more
demurely
licentious
young
men
become
modest
and
devout
instead
of
the
songs
of
the
carnival
religious
hymns
are
sung
tradesmen
forsake
their
shops
for
the
churches
alms
are
more
freely
given
great
scholars
become
monks
even
children
bring
their
offerings
to
the
church
a
pyramid
of
vanities
is
burned
on
the
public
square
and
no
wonder
a
man
had
appeared
at
a
great
crisis
in
wickedness
and
yet
while
the
people
were
still
susceptible
of
grand
sentiments
and
this
man
venerated
austere
impassioned
like
an
ancient
prophet
like
one
risen
from
the
dead
denounces
woes
with
such
awful
tones
such
majestic
fervor
such
terrible
emphasis
as
to
break
through
all
apathy
all
delusions
and
fill
the
people
with
remorse
astonish
them
by
his
revelations
and
make
them
really
feel
that
the
supernal
powers
armed
with
the
terrors
of
omnipotence
would
hurl
them
into
hell
unless
they
repented
no
man
in
europe
at
the
time
had
a
more
lively
and
impressive
sense
of
the
necessity
of
a
general
reformation
than
the
monk
of
mark
but
it
was
a
reform
in
morals
not
of
doctrine
he
saw
the
evils
of
the
day
yea
of
the
church
itself
with
perfect
clearness
and
demanded
redress
he
is
as
sad
in
view
of
these
acknowledged
evils
as
jeremiah
was
in
view
of
the
apostasy
of
the
jews
he
is
as
austere
in
his
own
life
as
elijah
or
john
the
baptist
was
he
would
not
abolish
monastic
institutions
but
he
would
reform
the
lives
of
the
monks
cure
them
of
gluttony
and
sensuality
not
shut
up
their
monasteries
he
would
not
rebel
against
the
authority
of
the
pope
for
even
savonarola
supposed
that
prelate
to
be
the
successor
of
saint
peter
but
he
would
prevent
the
pope
nepotism
and
luxury
and
worldly
spirit
make
him
once
more
a
true
servant
of
the
servants
of
god
even
when
clothed
with
the
insignia
of
universal
authority
he
would
not
give
up
auricular
confession
or
masses
for
the
dead
or
prayers
to
the
virgin
mary
for
these
were
indorsed
by
venerated
ages
but
he
would
rebuke
a
priest
if
found
in
unseemly
places
whatever
was
a
sin
when
measured
by
the
laws
of
immutable
morality
he
would
denounce
whoever
was
guilty
of
it
whatever
would
elevate
the
public
morals
he
would
advocate
whoever
opposed
his
morality
was
measured
by
the
declaration
of
christ
and
the
apostles
not
by
the
standard
of
a
corrupt
age
he
revered
the
scriptures
and
incessantly
pondered
them
and
exalted
their
authority
holding
them
to
be
the
ultimate
rule
of
holy
living
the
everlasting
handbook
of
travellers
to
the
heavenly
jerusalem
in
all
respects
he
was
a
good
man
a
beautiful
type
of
christian
piety
with
fewer
faults
than
luther
or
calvin
had
and
as
great
an
enemy
as
they
to
corruptions
in
state
and
church
which
he
denounced
even
more
fiercely
and
passionately
not
even
erasmus
pointed
out
the
vices
of
the
day
with
more
freedom
or
earnestness
he
covered
up
nothing
he
shut
his
eyes
to
nothing
the
difference
between
savonarola
and
luther
was
that
the
saxon
reformer
attacked
the
root
of
the
corruption
not
merely
outward
and
tangible
and
patent
sins
which
everybody
knew
but
also
and
more
earnestly
those
false
principles
of
theology
and
morals
which
sustained
them
and
which
logically
pushed
out
would
necessarily
have
produced
them
for
instance
he
not
merely
attacked
indulgences
then
a
crying
evil
as
peddled
by
tetzel
and
others
like
him
and
all
to
get
money
to
support
the
temporal
power
of
the
popes
or
build
peter
church
but
he
would
show
that
penance
on
which
indulgences
are
based
is
antagonistic
to
the
doctrine
which
paul
so
forcibly
expounded
respecting
the
forgiveness
of
sins
and
the
grounds
of
justification
and
luther
saw
that
all
the
evils
which
good
men
lamented
would
continue
so
long
as
the
false
principles
from
which
they
logically
sprung
were
the
creed
of
the
church
so
he
directed
his
giant
energies
to
reform
doctrines
rather
than
morals
his
great
idea
of
justification
could
be
defended
only
by
an
appeal
to
the
scriptures
not
to
the
authority
of
councils
and
learned
men
so
he
made
the
scriptures
the
sole
source
of
theological
doctrine
savonarola
also
accepted
the
scriptures
but
luther
would
put
them
in
the
hands
of
everybody
of
peasants
even
and
thus
instituted
private
judgment
which
is
the
basal
pillar
of
protestantism
the
catholic
theologians
never
recognized
this
right
in
the
sense
that
luther
understood
it
and
to
which
he
was
pushed
by
inexorable
logic
the
church
was
to
remain
the
interpreter
of
the
doctrinal
and
disputed
points
of
the
scriptures
savonarola
was
a
churchman
he
was
not
a
fearless
theological
doctor
going
wherever
logic
and
the
bible
carried
him
hence
he
did
not
stimulate
thought
and
inquiry
as
luther
did
nor
inaugurate
a
great
revolutionary
movement
which
would
gradually
undermine
papal
authority
and
many
institutions
which
the
catholic
church
indorsed
had
he
been
a
great
genius
with
his
progressive
proclivities
he
might
have
headed
a
rebellion
against
papal
authority
which
upheld
doctrines
that
logically
supported
the
very
evils
he
denounced
but
he
was
contented
to
lop
off
branches
he
did
not
dig
up
the
roots
luther
went
to
the
roots
as
calvin
did
as
saint
augustine
would
have
done
had
there
been
a
necessity
in
his
day
for
the
theology
of
saint
augustine
and
calvin
is
essentially
the
same
it
was
from
saint
augustine
that
calvin
drew
his
inspiration
next
after
saint
paul
but
savonarola
cared
very
little
for
the
discussion
of
doctrines
he
probably
hated
all
theological
speculations
all
metaphysical
divinity
yet
there
is
a
closer
resemblance
between
doctrines
and
morals
than
most
people
are
aware
of
as
a
man
thinketh
so
is
he
hence
the
reforms
of
savonarola
were
temporary
and
were
not
widely
extended
for
he
did
not
kindle
the
intelligence
of
the
age
as
did
luther
and
those
associated
with
him
there
can
be
no
great
and
lasting
reform
without
an
appeal
to
reason
without
the
assistance
of
logic
without
conviction
the
house
that
had
been
swept
and
garnished
was
by
devils
and
the
last
state
was
worse
than
the
first
to
have
effected
a
radical
and
lasting
reform
savonarola
should
have
gone
deeper
he
should
have
exposed
the
foundations
on
which
the
superstructure
of
sin
was
built
he
should
have
undermined
them
and
appealed
to
the
reason
of
the
world
he
did
no
such
thing
he
simply
rebuked
the
evils
which
must
needs
be
so
long
as
the
root
of
them
is
left
untouched
and
so
long
as
his
influence
remained
so
long
as
his
voice
was
listened
to
he
was
mighty
in
the
reforms
at
which
he
aimed
a
reformation
of
the
morals
of
those
to
whom
he
preached
but
when
his
voice
was
hushed
the
evils
he
detested
returned
since
he
had
not
created
those
convictions
which
bind
men
together
in
association
he
had
not
fanned
that
spirit
of
inquiry
which
is
hostile
to
ecclesiastical
despotism
and
which
logically
projected
would
subvert
the
papal
throne
the
reformation
of
luther
was
a
grand
protest
against
spiritual
tyranny
it
not
only
aimed
at
a
purer
life
but
it
opposed
the
bondage
of
the
middle
ages
and
all
the
superstitions
and
puerilities
and
fables
which
were
born
and
nurtured
in
that
dark
and
gloomy
period
and
to
which
the
clergy
clung
as
a
means
of
power
or
wealth
luther
called
out
the
intellect
of
germany
exalted
liberty
of
conscience
and
appealed
to
the
dignity
of
reason
he
showed
the
necessity
of
learning
in
order
to
unravel
and
explain
the
truths
of
revelation
he
made
piety
more
exalted
by
giving
it
an
intelligent
stimulus
he
looked
to
the
future
rather
than
the
past
he
would
make
use
in
his
interpretation
of
the
bible
of
all
that
literature
science
and
art
could
contribute
hence
his
writings
had
a
wider
influence
than
could
be
produced
by
the
fascination
of
personal
eloquence
on
which
savonarola
relied
but
which
luther
made
only
accessory
again
the
sermons
of
the
florentine
reformer
do
not
impress
us
as
they
did
those
to
whom
they
were
addressed
they
are
not
logical
nor
doctrinal
nor
learned
not
rich
in
thought
like
the
sermons
of
those
divines
whom
the
reformation
produced
they
are
vehement
denunciations
of
sin
are
eloquent
appeals
to
the
heart
to
religious
fears
and
hopes
he
would
indeed
create
faith
in
the
world
not
by
the
dissertations
of
paul
but
by
the
agonies
of
the
dying
christ
he
does
not
instruct
he
does
not
reason
he
is
dogmatic
and
practical
he
is
too
earnest
to
be
metaphysical
or
even
theological
he
takes
it
for
granted
that
his
hearers
know
all
the
truths
necessary
for
salvation
he
enforces
the
truths
with
which
they
are
familiar
not
those
to
be
developed
by
reason
and
learning
he
appeals
he
urges
he
threatens
he
even
prophesies
he
dwells
on
divine
wrath
and
judgment
he
is
an
isaiah
foretelling
what
will
happen
rather
than
a
peter
at
the
day
of
pentecost
savonarola
was
transcendent
in
his
oratorical
gifts
the
like
of
which
has
never
before
nor
since
been
witnessed
in
italy
he
was
a
born
orator
as
vehement
as
demosthenes
as
passionate
as
chrysostom
as
electrical
as
bernard
nothing
could
withstand
him
he
was
a
torrent
that
bore
everything
before
him
his
voice
was
musical
his
attitude
commanding
his
gestures
superb
he
was
all
alive
with
his
subject
he
was
terribly
in
earnest
as
if
he
believed
everything
he
said
and
that
what
he
said
were
most
momentous
truths
he
fastened
his
burning
eyes
upon
his
hearers
who
listened
with
breathless
attention
and
inspired
them
with
his
sentiments
he
made
them
feel
that
they
were
in
the
very
jaws
of
destruction
and
that
there
was
no
hope
but
in
immediate
repentance
his
whole
frame
quivered
with
emotion
and
he
sat
down
utterly
exhausted
his
language
was
intense
not
clothing
new
thoughts
but
riveting
old
ideas
the
ideas
of
the
middle
ages
the
fear
of
hell
the
judgments
of
almighty
god
who
could
resist
such
fiery
earnestness
such
a
convulsed
frame
such
quivering
tones
such
burning
eyes
such
dreadful
threatenings
such
awful
appeals
he
was
not
artistic
in
the
use
of
words
and
phrases
like
bourdaloue
but
he
reached
the
conscience
and
the
heart
like
whitefield
he
never
sought
to
amuse
he
would
not
stoop
to
any
trifling
he
told
no
stories
he
made
no
witticisms
he
used
no
tricks
he
fell
back
on
truths
no
matter
whether
his
hearers
relished
them
or
not
no
matter
whether
they
were
amused
or
not
he
was
the
messenger
of
god
urging
men
to
flee
as
for
their
lives
like
lot
when
he
escaped
from
sodom
savonarola
manner
was
as
effective
as
his
matter
he
was
a
kind
of
peter
the
hermit
preaching
a
crusade
arousing
emotions
and
passions
and
making
everybody
feel
as
he
felt
it
was
life
more
than
thought
which
marked
his
eloquence
his
voice
as
well
as
his
ideas
his
wonderful
electricity
which
every
preacher
must
have
or
he
preaches
to
stones
it
was
himself
even
more
than
his
truths
which
made
people
listen
admire
and
quake
all
real
orators
impress
themselves
their
own
individuality
on
their
auditors
they
are
not
actors
who
represent
other
people
and
whom
we
admire
in
proportion
to
their
artistic
skill
in
producing
deception
these
artists
excite
admiration
make
us
forget
where
we
are
and
what
we
are
but
kindle
no
permanent
emotions
and
teach
no
abiding
lessons
the
eloquent
preacher
of
momentous
truths
and
interests
makes
us
realize
them
in
proportion
as
he
feels
them
himself
they
would
fall
dead
upon
us
if
ever
so
grand
unless
intensified
by
passion
fervor
sincerity
earnestness
even
a
voice
has
power
when
electrical
musical
impassioned
although
it
may
utter
platitudes
but
when
the
impassioned
voice
rings
with
trumpet
notes
through
a
vast
audience
appealing
to
what
is
dearest
to
the
human
soul
lifting
the
mind
to
the
contemplation
of
the
sublimest
truths
and
most
momentous
interests
then
there
is
eloquence
such
as
is
never
heard
in
the
theatre
interested
as
spectators
may
be
in
the
triumphs
of
dramatic
art
but
i
have
dwelt
too
long
on
the
characteristics
of
that
eloquence
which
produced
such
a
great
effect
on
the
people
of
florence
in
the
latter
part
of
the
fifteenth
century
that
ardent
intense
and
lofty
monk
like
dante
not
like
shakspeare
who
filled
the
cathedral
church
with
eager
listeners
was
not
destined
to
uninterrupted
triumphs
his
career
was
short
he
could
not
even
retain
his
influence
as
the
english
people
wearied
of
the
yoke
of
a
puritan
protector
and
hankered
for
their
old
pleasures
so
the
florentines
remembered
the
sports
and
spectacles
and
of
the
old
medicean
rule
savonarola
had
arrayed
against
himself
the
enemies
of
popular
liberty
the
patrons
of
demoralizing
excitements
the
partisans
of
the
banished
medici
and
even
the
friends
and
counsellors
of
the
pope
the
dreadful
denunciation
of
sin
in
high
places
was
as
offensive
to
the
pope
as
the
exposure
of
a
tyrannical
usurpation
was
to
the
family
of
the
old
lords
of
florence
and
his
enemies
took
counsel
together
and
schemed
for
his
overthrow
if
the
irritating
questions
and
mockeries
of
socrates
could
not
be
endured
at
athens
how
could
the
bitter
invectives
and
denunciations
of
savonarola
find
favor
at
florence
the
fate
of
prophets
is
to
be
stoned
martyrdom
and
persecution
in
some
form
or
other
are
as
inevitable
to
the
man
who
sails
against
the
stream
as
a
broken
constitution
and
a
diseased
body
are
to
a
sensualist
a
glutton
or
a
drunkard
impatience
under
rebuke
is
as
certain
as
the
operation
of
natural
law
the
bitterest
and
most
powerful
enemy
of
the
prior
of
mark
was
the
pope
himself
alexander
of
the
infamous
family
of
the
borgias
since
his
private
vices
were
exposed
and
by
one
whose
order
had
been
especially
devoted
to
the
papal
empire
in
the
eyes
of
the
wicked
pope
the
florentine
reformer
was
a
traitor
and
conspirator
disloyal
and
dangerous
at
first
he
wished
to
silence
him
by
soft
and
deceitful
letters
and
tempting
bribes
offering
to
him
a
cardinal
hat
and
inviting
him
to
rome
but
savonarola
refused
alike
the
bribe
and
the
invitation
his
lenten
sermons
became
more
violent
and
daring
if
i
have
preached
and
written
anything
heretical
said
this
intrepid
monk
i
am
willing
to
make
a
public
recantation
i
have
always
shown
obedience
to
my
church
but
it
is
my
duty
to
obey
god
rather
than
man
this
sounds
like
luther
at
the
diet
of
worms
but
he
was
more
defenceless
than
luther
since
the
saxon
reformer
was
protected
by
powerful
princes
and
was
backed
by
the
enthusiasm
of
northern
germans
yet
the
florentine
preacher
boldly
continued
his
attacks
on
all
hypocritical
religion
and
on
the
vices
of
rome
not
as
incidental
to
the
system
but
extraneous
the
faults
of
a
man
or
age
the
pope
became
furious
to
be
thus
balked
by
a
dominican
monk
and
in
one
of
the
cities
of
italy
a
city
that
had
not
rebelled
against
his
authority
he
complained
bitterly
to
the
florentine
ambassador
of
the
haughty
friar
who
rebuked
and
defied
him
he
summoned
a
consistory
of
fourteen
eminent
dominican
theologians
to
inquire
into
his
conduct
and
opinions
and
issued
a
brief
forbidding
him
to
preach
under
penalty
of
excommunication
yet
savonarola
continued
to
preach
and
more
violently
than
ever
he
renewed
his
charges
against
rome
he
even
called
her
a
harlot
church
against
whom
heaven
and
earth
angels
and
devils
equally
brought
charges
the
pope
then
seized
the
old
thunderbolts
of
the
gregories
and
the
clements
and
excommunicated
the
daring
monk
and
preacher
and
threatened
the
like
punishment
on
all
who
should
befriend
him
and
yet
savonarola
continued
to
preach
all
rome
and
italy
talked
of
the
audacity
of
the
man
and
it
was
not
until
florence
itself
was
threatened
with
an
interdict
for
shielding
such
a
man
that
the
magistrates
of
the
city
were
compelled
to
forbid
his
preaching
the
great
orator
mounted
his
pulpit
march
now
four
hundred
years
ago
and
took
an
affectionate
farewell
of
the
people
whom
he
had
led
and
appealed
to
christ
himself
as
the
head
of
the
church
it
was
not
till
the
preacher
was
silenced
by
the
magistrates
of
his
own
city
that
he
seems
to
have
rebelled
against
the
papal
authority
and
then
not
so
much
against
the
authority
of
rome
as
against
the
wicked
shepherd
himself
who
had
usurped
the
fold
he
now
writes
letters
to
all
the
prominent
kings
and
princes
of
europe
to
assemble
a
general
council
for
the
general
council
of
constance
had
passed
a
resolution
that
the
pope
must
call
a
general
council
every
ten
years
and
that
should
he
neglect
to
assemble
it
the
sovereign
powers
of
the
various
states
and
empires
were
themselves
empowered
to
collect
the
scattered
members
of
the
universal
church
to
deliberate
on
its
affairs
in
his
letters
to
the
kings
of
france
england
spain
and
hungary
and
the
emperor
of
germany
he
denounced
the
pope
as
simoniacal
as
guilty
of
all
the
vices
as
a
disgrace
to
the
station
which
he
held
these
letters
seem
to
have
been
directed
against
the
man
not
against
the
system
he
aimed
at
the
pope
ejectment
from
office
rather
than
at
the
subversion
of
the
office
itself
another
mark
of
the
difference
between
savonarola
and
luther
since
the
latter
waged
an
uncompromising
war
against
rome
herself
against
the
whole
and
government
and
institutions
and
dogmas
of
the
catholic
church
and
that
is
the
reason
why
catholics
hate
luther
so
bitterly
and
deny
to
him
either
virtues
or
graces
and
represent
even
his
deathbed
as
a
scene
of
torment
and
despair
an
instance
of
that
pursuing
hatred
which
goes
beyond
the
grave
like
that
of
the
zealots
of
the
revolution
in
france
who
dug
up
the
bones
of
the
ancient
kings
from
those
vaults
where
they
had
reposed
for
centuries
and
scattered
their
ashes
to
the
winds
savonarola
hoped
the
christian
world
would
come
to
his
rescue
but
his
letters
were
intercepted
and
reached
the
eye
of
alexander
who
now
bent
the
whole
force
of
the
papal
empire
to
destroy
that
bold
reformer
who
had
assailed
his
throne
and
it
seems
that
a
change
took
place
in
florence
itself
in
popular
sentiment
the
medicean
party
obtained
the
ascendency
in
the
government
the
people
the
fickle
people
began
to
desert
savonarola
and
especially
when
he
refused
to
undergo
the
ordeal
of
fire
one
of
the
relics
of
mediaeval
superstition
the
people
felt
that
they
had
been
cheated
out
of
their
amusement
for
they
had
waited
impatiently
the
whole
day
in
the
public
square
to
see
the
spectacle
he
finally
consented
to
undergo
the
ordeal
provided
he
might
carry
the
crucifix
to
this
his
enemies
would
not
consent
he
then
laid
aside
the
crucifix
but
insisted
on
entering
the
fire
with
the
sacrament
in
his
hand
his
persecutors
would
not
allow
this
either
and
the
ordeal
did
not
take
place
at
last
his
martyrdom
approaches
he
is
led
to
prison
the
magistrates
of
the
city
send
to
rome
for
absolution
for
having
allowed
the
prior
to
preach
his
enemies
busy
themselves
in
collecting
evidence
against
him
for
what
i
know
not
except
that
he
had
denounced
corruption
and
sin
and
had
predicted
woe
his
two
friends
are
imprisoned
and
interrogated
with
him
fra
domenico
da
pescia
and
fra
silvestro
maruffi
who
are
willing
to
die
for
him
he
and
they
are
now
subjected
to
most
cruel
tortures
as
the
result
of
bodily
agony
his
mind
begins
to
waver
his
answers
are
incoherent
he
implores
his
tormentors
to
end
his
agonies
he
cries
out
with
a
voice
enough
to
melt
a
heart
of
stone
take
oh
take
my
life
yet
he
confessed
nothing
to
criminate
himself
what
they
wished
him
especially
to
confess
was
that
he
had
pretended
to
be
a
prophet
since
he
had
predicted
calamities
but
all
men
are
prophets
in
one
sense
when
they
declare
the
certain
penalties
of
sin
from
which
no
one
can
escape
though
he
take
the
wings
of
the
morning
and
fly
to
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
sea
savonarola
thus
far
had
remained
firm
but
renewed
examinations
and
fresh
tortures
took
place
for
a
whole
month
his
torments
were
continuous
in
one
day
he
was
drawn
up
by
a
rope
fourteen
times
and
then
suddenly
dropped
until
all
his
muscles
quivered
with
anguish
had
he
been
surrounded
by
loving
disciples
like
latimer
at
the
burning
pile
he
might
have
summoned
more
strength
but
alone
in
a
dark
inquisitorial
prison
subjected
to
increasing
torture
among
bitter
foes
he
did
not
fully
defend
his
visions
and
prophecies
and
then
his
extorted
confessions
were
diabolically
altered
but
that
was
all
they
could
get
out
of
him
that
he
had
prophesied
in
all
matters
of
faith
he
was
sound
the
inquisitors
were
obliged
to
bring
their
examination
to
an
end
they
could
find
no
fault
with
him
and
yet
they
were
determined
on
his
death
the
government
of
florence
consented
to
it
and
hastened
it
for
a
medici
again
held
the
highest
office
of
the
state
nothing
remained
to
the
imprisoned
and
tortured
friar
but
to
prepare
for
his
execution
in
his
supreme
trial
he
turned
to
the
god
in
whom
he
believed
in
the
words
of
the
dying
xavier
on
the
island
of
sancian
he
exclaimed
te
domine
speravi
non
confundar
in
o
lord
he
prays
a
thousand
times
hast
thou
wiped
out
my
iniquity
i
do
not
rely
on
my
own
justification
but
on
thy
mercy
his
few
remaining
days
in
prison
were
passed
in
holy
meditation
at
last
the
officers
of
the
papal
commission
arrive
the
tortures
are
renewed
and
also
the
examinations
with
the
same
result
no
fault
could
be
found
with
his
doctrines
but
a
dead
enemy
said
they
fights
no
more
he
is
condemned
to
execution
the
messengers
of
death
arrive
at
his
cell
and
find
him
on
his
knees
he
is
overpowered
by
his
sufferings
and
vigils
and
can
with
difficulty
be
kept
from
sleep
but
he
arouses
himself
and
passes
the
night
in
prayer
and
administers
the
elements
of
redemption
to
his
doomed
companions
and
closes
with
this
prayer
lord
i
know
thou
art
that
perfect
trinity
father
son
and
holy
ghost
i
know
that
thou
art
the
eternal
word
that
thou
didst
descend
from
heaven
into
the
bosom
of
mary
that
thou
didst
ascend
upon
the
cross
to
shed
thy
blood
for
our
sins
i
pray
thee
that
by
that
blood
i
may
have
remission
for
my
sins
the
simple
faith
of
paul
of
augustine
of
pascal
he
then
partook
of
the
communion
and
descended
to
the
public
square
while
the
crowd
gazed
silently
and
with
trepidation
and
was
led
with
his
companions
to
the
first
tribunal
where
he
was
disrobed
of
his
ecclesiastical
dress
then
they
were
led
to
another
tribunal
and
delivered
to
the
secular
arm
then
to
another
where
sentence
of
death
was
read
and
then
to
the
place
of
execution
not
a
burning
funeral
pyre
but
a
scaffold
which
mounting
composed
calm
absorbed
savonarola
submitted
his
neck
to
the
hangman
in
the
year
of
his
life
a
martyr
to
the
cause
of
christ
not
for
an
attack
on
the
church
or
its
doctrines
or
its
institutions
but
for
having
denounced
the
corruption
and
vices
of
those
who
ruled
it
for
having
preached
against
sin
thus
died
one
of
the
greatest
and
best
men
of
his
age
one
of
the
truest
and
purest
whom
the
catholic
church
has
produced
in
any
age
he
was
stern
uncompromising
austere
but
a
reformer
and
a
saint
a
man
who
was
merciful
and
generous
in
the
possession
of
power
an
enlightened
statesman
a
sound
theologian
and
a
fearless
preacher
of
that
righteousness
which
exalteth
a
nation
he
had
no
vices
no
striking
defects
he
lived
according
to
the
rules
of
the
convent
he
governed
with
the
same
wisdom
that
he
governed
a
city
and
he
died
in
the
faith
of
the
primitive
apostles
his
piety
was
monastic
but
his
spirit
was
progressive
sympathizing
with
liberty
advocating
public
morality
he
was
unselfish
disinterested
and
true
to
his
church
his
conscience
and
his
cause
a
noble
specimen
both
of
a
man
and
christian
whose
deeds
and
example
form
part
of
the
inheritance
of
an
admiring
posterity
we
pity
his
closing
days
after
such
a
career
of
power
and
influence
but
we
may
as
well
compassionate
socrates
or
paul
the
greatest
lights
of
the
world
have
gone
out
in
martyrdom
to
be
extinguished
however
only
for
a
time
and
then
to
loom
up
again
in
another
age
and
burn
with
inextinguishable
brightness
to
remotest
generations
as
examples
of
the
power
of
faith
and
truth
in
this
wicked
and
rebellious
world
a
world
to
be
finally
redeemed
by
the
labors
and
religion
of
just
such
men
whose
days
are
days
of
sadness
protest
and
suffering
and
whose
hours
of
triumph
and
exaltation
are
not
like
those
of
conquerors
nor
like
those
whose
eyes
stand
out
with
fatness
but
few
and
far
between
i
have
loved
righteousness
i
have
hated
iniquity
said
the
great
champion
of
the
mediaeval
church
and
therefore
i
die
in
exile
in
ten
years
after
this
ignominious
execution
raphael
painted
the
martyr
among
the
sainted
doctors
of
the
church
in
the
halls
of
the
vatican
and
future
popes
did
justice
to
his
memory
for
he
inaugurated
that
reform
movement
in
the
catholic
church
itself
which
took
place
within
fifty
years
after
his
death
in
one
sense
he
was
the
precursor
of
loyola
of
xavier
and
of
aquaviva
those
illustrious
men
who
headed
the
jesuits
indeed
but
ardent
in
piety
and
enlightened
by
the
spirit
of
a
progressive
age
he
was
the
first
says
villari
in
the
fifteenth
century
to
make
men
feel
that
a
new
light
had
awakened
the
human
race
and
thus
he
was
a
prophet
of
a
new
civilization
the
forerunner
of
luther
of
bacon
of
descartes
hence
the
drama
of
his
life
became
after
his
death
the
drama
of
europe
in
the
course
of
a
single
generation
after
luther
had
declared
his
mission
the
spirit
of
the
church
of
rome
underwent
a
change
from
the
halls
of
the
vatican
to
the
secluded
hermitages
of
the
apennines
this
revival
was
felt
instead
of
a
borgia
there
reigned
a
caraffa
and
it
is
remarkable
that
from
the
day
that
the
in
the
catholic
church
was
headed
by
the
early
jesuits
protestantism
gained
no
new
victories
and
in
two
centuries
so
far
declined
in
piety
and
zeal
that
the
cities
which
witnessed
the
noblest
triumphs
of
luther
and
calvin
were
disgraced
by
a
boasting
rationalism
to
be
succeeded
again
in
our
times
by
an
arrogance
of
scepticism
which
has
had
no
parallel
since
the
days
of
democritus
and
lucretius
it
was
the
desire
of
savonarola
that
reason
religion
and
liberty
might
meet
in
harmonious
union
but
he
did
not
think
a
new
system
of
religious
doctrines
was
necessary
the
influence
of
such
a
man
can
not
pass
away
and
has
not
passed
away
for
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
his
views
have
been
embraced
by
enlightened
catholics
from
his
day
to
ours
by
such
men
as
pascal
fénelon
and
lacordaire
and
thousands
like
them
who
prefer
ritualism
and
auricular
confession
and
penance
monasticism
and
an
ecclesiastical
monarch
and
all
the
machinery
of
a
complicated
hierarchy
with
all
the
evils
growing
out
of
papal
domination
to
rationalism
sectarian
dissensions
irreverence
license
want
of
unity
want
of
government
and
even
dispensation
from
the
marriage
vow
which
is
worse
the
physical
arm
of
the
beast
or
the
maniac
soul
of
a
lying
prophet
which
is
worse
the
superstition
and
narrowness
which
excludes
the
bible
from
schools
or
that
unbounded
toleration
which
smiles
on
those
audacious
infidels
who
cloak
their
cruel
attacks
on
the
faith
of
christians
with
the
name
of
a
progressive
civilization
and
so
far
advanced
that
one
of
these

one

the
most
fitting

of

in

also
as

illustrious
example
of

which

he
was
superior
in
all
that
is
sterling
and
grand
in
character
to
any
man
of
his
age
certainly
in
italy
exhibiting
a
rugged
stern
greatness
which
reminds
us
of
dante
and
of
other
great
benefactors
nurtured
in
the
school
of
sorrow
and
disappointment
leading
a
checkered
life
doomed
to
envy
ingratitude
and
neglect
rarely
understood
and
never
fully
appreciated
even
by
those
who
employed
and
honored
him
he
was
an
isolated
man
grave
abstracted
lonely
yet
not
unhappy
since
his
world
was
that
of
glorious
and
exalting
ideas
even
those
of
grace
beauty
majesty
and
harmony
the
world
which
plato
lived
in
and
in
which
all
great
men
live
who
seek
to
rise
above
the
transient
the
false
and
puerile
in
common
life
he
was
also
an
original
genius
remarkable
in
everything
he
attempted
whether
as
sculptor
painter
or
architect
and
even
as
poet
he
saw
the
archetypes
of
everything
beautiful
and
grand
which
are
invisible
except
to
those
who
are
almost
divinely
gifted
and
he
had
the
practical
skill
to
embody
them
in
permanent
forms
so
that
all
ages
may
study
those
forms
and
rise
through
them
to
the
realms
in
which
his
soul
lived
michael
angelo
not
only
created
but
he
reproduced
he
reproduced
the
glories
of
grecian
and
roman
art
he
restored
the
old
civilization
in
his
pictures
his
statues
and
his
grand
edifices
he
revived
a
taste
for
what
is
imperishable
in
antiquity
as
such
he
is
justly
regarded
as
an
immortal
benefactor
for
it
is
art
which
gives
to
nations
culture
refinement
and
the
enjoyment
of
the
beautiful
art
diverts
the
mind
from
low
and
commonplace
pursuits
exalts
the
imagination
and
makes
its
votary
indifferent
to
the
evils
of
life
it
raises
the
soul
into
regions
of
peace
and
bliss
but
art
is
most
ennobling
when
it
is
inspired
by
lofty
and
consecrated
sentiments
like
those
of
religion
patriotism
and
love
now
ancient
art
was
consecrated
to
paganism
of
course
there
were
noble
exceptions
but
as
a
general
rule
temples
were
erected
in
honor
of
heathen
deities
statues
represented
mere
physical
strength
and
beauty
and
grace
pictures
portrayed
the
charms
of
an
unsanctified
humanity
hence
ancient
art
did
very
little
to
arrest
human
degeneracy
facilitated
rather
than
retarded
the
ruin
of
states
and
empires
since
it
did
not
stimulate
the
virtues
on
which
the
strength
of
man
is
based
it
did
not
check
those
depraved
tastes
and
habits
which
are
based
on
egotism
now
the
restorers
of
ancient
art
can
not
be
said
to
have
contributed
to
the
moral
elevation
of
the
new
races
unless
they
avoided
the
sensualism
of
greece
and
rome
and
appealed
purely
to
those
eternal
ideas
which
the
human
mind
even
under
pagan
influences
sometimes
conceived
and
which
do
not
conflict
with
christianity
itself
in
considering
the
life
and
labors
of
michael
angelo
then
we
are
to
examine
whether
in
the
classical
glories
of
antiquity
which
he
substituted
for
the
gothic
and
mediaeval
he
advanced
civilization
in
the
noblest
sense
and
moreover
whether
he
carried
art
to
a
higher
degree
than
was
ever
attained
by
the
greeks
and
romans
and
hence
became
a
benefactor
of
the
world
in
considering
these
points
i
shall
not
attempt
a
minute
criticism
of
his
works
i
can
only
seize
on
the
great
outlines
the
salient
points
of
those
productions
which
have
given
him
immortality
no
lecture
can
be
exhaustive
if
it
only
prove
suggestive
it
has
reached
its
end
michael
angelo
stands
out
in
history
in
the
three
aspects
of
sculptor
painter
and
architect
and
that
too
in
a
country
devoted
to
art
and
in
an
age
when
italy
won
all
her
modern
glories
arising
from
the
matchless
works
which
that
age
produced
indeed
those
works
will
probably
never
be
surpassed
since
all
the
energies
of
a
great
nation
were
concentrated
upon
their
production
even
as
our
own
age
confines
itself
chiefly
to
mechanical
inventions
and
scientific
research
and
speculation
what
railroads
and
telegraphs
and
spindles
and
chemical
tests
and
compounds
are
to
us
what
philosophy
was
to
the
greeks
what
government
and
jurisprudence
were
to
the
romans
what
cathedrals
and
metaphysical
subtilties
were
to
the
middle
ages
what
theological
inquiries
were
to
the
divines
of
the
seventeenth
century
what
social
urbanities
and
refinements
were
to
the
french
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
fine
arts
were
to
the
italians
in
the
sixteenth
century
a
fact
too
commonplace
to
dwell
upon
and
which
will
be
conceded
when
we
bear
in
mind
that
no
age
has
been
distinguished
for
everything
and
that
nations
can
try
satisfactorily
but
one
experiment
at
a
time
and
are
not
likely
to
repeat
it
with
the
same
enthusiasm
as
the
mind
is
unbounded
in
its
capacities
and
our
world
affords
inexhaustible
fields
of
enterprise
the
progress
of
the
race
is
to
be
seen
in
the
new
developments
which
successively
appear
but
in
which
only
a
certain
limit
has
thus
far
been
reached
not
in
absolute
perfection
in
any
particular
sphere
is
this
progress
seen
but
rather
in
the
variety
of
the
experiments
it
may
be
doubted
whether
any
grecian
edifice
will
ever
surpass
the
parthenon
in
beauty
of
proportion
or
fitness
of
ornament
or
any
nude
statue
show
grace
of
form
more
impressive
than
the
venus
de
milo
or
the
apollo
belvedere
or
any
system
of
jurisprudence
be
more
completely
codified
than
that
systematized
by
justinian
or
any
gothic
church
rival
the
lofty
expression
of
cologne
cathedral
or
any
painting
surpass
the
holy
serenity
and
ethereal
love
depicted
in
raphael
madonnas
or
any
court
witness
such
a
brilliant
assemblage
of
wits
and
beauties
as
met
at
versailles
to
render
homage
to
louis
xiv
or
any
theological
discussion
excite
such
a
national
interest
as
when
luther
confronted
doctor
eck
in
the
great
hall
of
the
electoral
palace
at
leipsic
or
any
theatrical
excitement
such
as
was
produced
on
cultivated
intellects
when
garrick
and
siddons
represented
the
sublime
conceptions
of
the
shakspeare
these
glories
may
reappear
but
never
will
they
shine
as
they
did
before
no
more
olympian
games
no
more
roman
triumphs
no
more
dodona
oracles
no
more
flavian
amphitheatres
no
more
mediaeval
cathedrals
no
more
councils
of
nice
or
trent
no
more
spectacles
of
kings
holding
the
stirrups
of
popes
no
more
fields
of
the
cloth
of
gold
no
more
reigns
of
court
mistresses
in
such
palaces
as
versailles
and
fontainbleau
ah
i
wish
i
could
add
no
more
such
battlefields
as
marengo
and
waterloo
only
copies
and
imitations
of
these
and
without
the
older
charm
the
world
is
moving
on
and
perpetually
changing
nor
can
we
tell
what
new
vanity
will
next
arise
vanity
or
glory
according
to
our
varying
notions
of
the
dignity
and
destiny
of
man
we
may
predict
that
it
will
not
be
any
mechanical
improvement
for
ere
long
the
limit
will
be
reached
and
it
will
be
reached
when
the
great
mass
can
not
find
work
to
do
for
the
everlasting
destiny
of
man
is
toil
and
labor
but
it
will
be
some
sublime
wonders
of
which
we
can
not
now
conceive
and
which
in
time
will
pass
away
for
other
wonders
and
novelties
until
the
great
circle
is
completed
and
all
human
experiments
shall
verify
the
moral
wisdom
of
the
eternal
revelation
then
all
that
man
has
done
all
that
man
can
do
in
his
own
boastful
thought
will
be
seen
in
the
light
of
the
celestial
verities
to
be
indeed
a
vanity
and
a
failure
not
of
human
ingenuity
and
power
but
to
realize
the
happiness
which
is
only
promised
as
the
result
of
supernatural
not
mortal
strength
yet
which
the
soul
in
its
restless
aspirations
never
ceases
its
efforts
to
secure
everlasting
to
reach
the
unattainable
on
earth
now
the
revival
of
art
in
italy
was
one
of
the
great
movements
in
the
series
of
human
development
it
peculiarly
characterized
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
it
was
an
age
of
artistic
wonders
of
great
creations
italy
especially
was
glorious
when
michael
angelo
was
born
when
the
rest
of
europe
was
comparatively
rude
and
when
no
great
works
in
art
in
poetry
in
history
or
philosophy
had
yet
appeared
he
was
descended
from
an
illustrious
family
and
was
destined
to
one
of
the
learned
professions
but
he
could
not
give
up
his
mind
to
anything
but
drawing
as
annoying
to
his
father
as
galileo
experiments
were
to
his
parent
as
unmeaning
to
him
as
gibbon
history
was
to
george
scribble
scribble
scribble
gibbon
i
perceive
sir
you
are
always
no
perception
of
a
new
power
no
sympathy
with
the
abandonment
to
a
specialty
not
indorsed
by
fashions
and
traditions
but
without
which
abandonment
genius
can
not
easily
be
developed
at
last
the
father
yielded
and
the
son
was
apprenticed
to
a
painter
a
degradation
in
the
eyes
of
mediaeval
aristocracy
the
celebrated
lorenzo
de
medici
was
then
in
the
height
of
power
and
fame
in
florence
adored
by
roscoe
as
the
patron
of
artists
and
poets
although
he
subverted
the
liberties
of
his
country
this
prince
heir
of
the
fortunes
of
a
great
family
of
merchants
wishing
to
establish
a
school
for
sculpture
filled
a
garden
with
statues
and
freely
admitted
to
it
young
scholars
in
art
michael
angelo
was
one
of
the
most
frequent
and
enthusiastic
visitors
to
this
garden
where
in
due
time
he
attracted
the
attention
of
the
magnificent
lord
of
florence
by
a
head
chiselled
so
remarkably
that
he
became
an
inmate
of
the
palace
sat
at
the
table
of
lorenzo
and
at
last
was
regularly
adopted
as
one
of
the
prince
family
with
every
facility
for
prosecuting
his
studies
before
he
was
eighteen
the
youth
had
sculptured
the
battle
of
hercules
with
the
centaurs
which
he
would
never
part
with
and
which
still
remains
in
his
family
so
well
done
that
he
himself
at
the
age
of
eighty
regretted
that
he
had
not
given
up
his
whole
life
to
sculpture
it
was
then
as
a
sculptor
that
michael
angelo
first
appears
to
the
historical
student
about
the
year
when
columbus
was
crossing
the
great
unknown
ocean
to
realize
his
belief
in
a
western
passage
to
india
thus
commercial
enterprise
began
with
the
revival
of
art
and
was
destined
never
to
be
separated
in
its
alliance
with
it
since
commerce
brings
wealth
and
wealth
seeks
to
ornament
the
palaces
and
gardens
which
it
has
created
or
purchased
the
sculptor
art
was
not
born
until
piety
had
already
edifices
in
which
to
worship
god
or
pride
the
monuments
in
which
it
sought
the
glories
of
a
name
but
it
made
rapid
progress
as
wealth
increased
and
taste
became
refined
as
the
need
was
felt
for
ornaments
and
symbols
to
adorn
naked
walls
and
empty
spaces
especially
statuary
grouped
or
single
of
men
or
animals
a
marble
history
to
interpret
or
reproduce
consecrated
associations
churches
might
do
without
them
the
glass
stained
in
every
color
of
the
rainbow
the
altar
shining
with
gold
and
silver
and
precious
stones
the
pillars
multiplied
and
diversified
and
rich
in
foliated
circles
mullions
mouldings
groins
and
bosses
and
bearing
aloft
the
arched
and
ponderous
roof
one
scene
of
dazzling
magnificence
these
could
do
without
them
but
the
palaces
and
halls
and
houses
of
the
rich
required
the
image
of
man
and
of
man
not
emaciated
and
worn
and
monstrous
but
of
man
as
he
appeared
to
the
classical
greeks
in
the
perfection
of
form
and
physical
beauty
so
the
artists
who
arose
with
the
revival
of
commerce
with
the
multiplication
of
human
wants
and
the
study
of
antiquity
sought
to
restore
the
buried
statues
with
the
literature
and
laws
it
was
in
sculptured
marbles
that
enthusiasm
was
most
marked
these
were
found
in
abundance
in
various
parts
of
italy
whenever
the
vast
débris
of
the
ancient
magnificence
was
removed
and
were
universally
admired
and
prized
by
popes
cardinals
and
princes
and
formed
the
nucleus
of
great
museums
the
works
of
michael
angelo
as
a
sculptor
were
not
numerous
but
in
sublimity
they
have
never
been
surpassed
multa
sed
his
unfinished
monument
of
julius
begun
at
that
pontiff
request
as
a
mausoleum
is
perhaps
his
greatest
work
and
the
statue
of
moses
which
formed
a
part
of
it
has
been
admired
for
three
hundred
years
in
this
as
in
his
other
masterpieces
grandeur
and
majesty
are
his
characteristics
it
may
have
been
a
reproduction
and
yet
it
is
not
a
copy
he
made
character
and
moral
force
the
first
consideration
and
form
subservient
to
expression
and
here
he
differed
it
is
said
by
great
critics
from
the
ancients
who
thought
more
of
form
than
of
moral
expression
as
may
be
seen
in
the
faces
of
the
venus
de
medici
and
the
apollo
belvedere
matchless
and
inimitable
as
these
statues
are
in
grace
and
beauty
the
laocoön
and
the
dying
gladiator
are
indeed
exceptions
for
it
is
character
which
constitutes
their
chief
merit
the
expression
of
pain
despair
and
agony
but
there
is
almost
no
intellectual
or
moral
expression
in
the
faces
of
other
famous
and
remarkable
antique
statues
only
beauty
and
variety
of
form
such
as
powers
exhibited
in
his
greek
slave
an
inferior
excellence
since
it
is
much
easier
to
copy
the
beautiful
in
the
nude
statues
which
people
italy
than
to
express
such
intellectual
majesty
as
michael
angelo
conceived
that
intellectual
expression
which
story
has
succeeded
in
giving
to
his
african
sibyl
thus
while
the
great
artist
retained
the
antique
he
superadded
a
loftiness
such
as
the
ancients
rarely
produced
and
sculpture
became
in
his
hands
not
demoralizing
and
pagan
resplendent
in
sensual
charms
but
instructive
and
exalting
instructive
for
the
marvellous
display
of
anatomical
knowledge
and
exalting
from
grand
conceptions
of
dignity
and
power
his
knowledge
of
anatomy
was
so
remarkable
that
he
could
work
without
models
our
artists
in
these
days
must
always
have
before
their
eyes
some
nude
figure
to
copy
the
same
peculiarities
which
have
given
him
fame
as
a
sculptor
he
carried
out
into
painting
in
which
he
is
even
more
remarkable
for
the
artists
of
italy
at
this
period
often
combined
a
skill
for
all
the
fine
arts
in
sculpture
they
were
much
indebted
to
the
ancients
but
painting
seems
to
have
been
purely
a
development
in
the
middle
ages
it
was
comparatively
rude
no
noted
painter
arose
until
cimabue
in
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
century
before
him
painting
was
a
lifeless
imitation
of
models
afforded
by
greek
workers
in
mosaics
but
cimabue
abandoned
this
servile
copying
and
gave
a
new
expression
to
heads
and
grouped
his
figures
under
giotto
who
was
contemporary
with
dante
drawing
became
still
more
correct
and
coloring
softer
after
him
painting
was
rapidly
advanced
pietro
della
francesca
was
the
father
of
perspective
domenico
painted
in
oil
discovered
by
van
eyck
in
flanders
in
masaccio
studied
anatomy
gilding
disappeared
as
a
background
around
pictures
in
the
fifteenth
century
the
enthusiasm
for
painting
became
intense
even
monks
became
painters
and
every
convent
and
church
and
palace
was
deemed
incomplete
without
pictures
but
ideal
beauty
and
harmony
in
coloring
were
still
wanting
as
well
as
freedom
of
the
pencil
then
arose
da
vinci
and
michael
angelo
who
practised
the
immutable
principles
by
which
art
could
be
advanced
and
rapidly
following
in
their
steps
fra
bartolommeo
fra
angelico
rossi
and
andrea
del
sarto
made
the
age
an
era
in
painting
until
the
art
culminated
in
raphael
and
corregio
and
titian
and
divers
cities
of
italy
bologna
milan
parma
and
venice
disputed
with
rome
and
florence
for
the
empire
of
art
as
also
did
many
other
cities
which
might
be
mentioned
each
of
which
has
a
history
each
of
which
is
hallowed
by
poetic
associations
so
that
all
men
who
have
lived
in
italy
or
even
visited
it
feel
a
peculiar
interest
in
these
cities
an
interest
which
they
can
feel
in
no
others
even
if
they
be
such
capitals
as
london
and
paris
i
excuse
this
extravagant
admiration
for
the
wonderful
masterpieces
produced
in
that
age
making
marble
and
canvas
eloquent
with
the
most
inspiring
sentiments
because
wrapt
in
the
joys
which
they
excite
the
cultivated
and
imaginative
man
forgets
and
rejoices
that
he
can
forget
the
priests
and
beggars
the
dirty
hotels
filthy
friars
superstition
unthrift
jesuitism
which
stare
ordinary
tourists
in
the
face
and
all
the
other
disgusting
realities
which
philanthropists
deplore
so
loudly
in
that
degenerate
but
classical
and
land
for
come
what
will
in
spite
of
popes
and
despots
it
has
been
the
scene
of
the
highest
glories
of
antiquity
calling
to
our
minds
saints
and
martyrs
as
well
as
conquerors
and
emperors
and
revealing
at
every
turn
their
tombs
and
broken
monuments
and
all
the
hoary
remnants
of
unsurpassed
magnificence
as
well
as
preserving
in
churches
and
palaces
those
wonders
which
were
created
when
italy
once
again
lived
in
the
noble
aspiration
of
making
herself
the
centre
and
the
pride
of
the
new
civilization
da
vinci
the
oldest
of
the
great
masters
who
immortalized
that
era
died
in
in
the
arms
of
francis
of
france
and
michael
angelo
received
his
mantle
the
young
sculptor
was
taken
away
from
his
chisel
to
paint
for
pope
julius
the
ceiling
of
the
sistine
chapel
after
the
death
of
his
patron
lorenzo
he
had
studied
and
done
famous
work
in
marble
at
bologna
at
rome
and
again
at
florence
he
had
also
painted
some
and
with
such
immediate
success
that
he
had
been
invited
to
assist
da
vinci
in
decorating
a
hall
in
the
ducal
palace
at
florence
but
sculpture
was
his
chosen
art
and
when
called
to
paint
the
sistine
chapel
he
implored
the
pope
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
finish
the
mausoleum
which
he
had
begun
and
that
raphael
then
dazzling
the
whole
city
by
his
unprecedented
talents
might
be
substituted
for
him
in
that
great
work
but
the
pope
was
inflexible
and
the
great
artist
began
his
task
assisted
by
other
painters
however
he
soon
got
disgusted
with
them
and
sent
them
away
and
worked
alone
for
twenty
months
he
toiled
rarely
seen
living
abstemiously
absorbed
utterly
in
his
work
of
creation
and
the
greater
portion
of
the
compartments
in
the
vast
ceiling
was
finished
before
any
other
voice
than
his
except
the
admiring
voice
of
the
pope
pronounced
it
good
it
would
be
useless
to
attempt
to
describe
those
celebrated
frescos
their
subjects
were
taken
from
the
book
of
genesis
with
great
figures
of
sibyls
and
prophets
they
are
now
by
the
accumulated
dust
and
smoke
of
three
hundred
years
and
can
be
surveyed
only
by
reclining
at
full
length
on
the
back
we
see
enough
however
to
be
impressed
with
the
boldness
the
majesty
and
the
originality
of
the
figures
their
fidelity
to
nature
the
knowledge
of
anatomy
displayed
and
the
disdain
of
inferior
arts
especially
the
noble
disdain
of
appealing
to
false
and
perverted
taste
as
if
he
painted
from
an
exalted
ideal
in
his
own
mind
which
ideal
is
ever
associated
with
creative
power
it
is
this
creative
power
which
places
michael
angelo
at
the
head
of
the
artists
of
his
great
age
and
not
merely
the
power
to
create
but
the
power
of
realizing
the
most
exalted
conceptions
raphael
was
doubtless
superior
to
him
in
grace
and
beauty
even
as
titian
afterwards
surpassed
him
in
coloring
he
delighted
like
dante
in
the
awful
and
the
terrible
this
grandeur
of
conception
was
especially
seen
in
his
last
judgment
executed
thirty
years
afterwards
in
completion
of
the
sistine
chapel
the
work
on
which
had
been
suspended
at
the
death
of
julius
this
vast
fresco
is
nearly
seventy
feet
in
height
painted
upon
the
wall
at
the
end
of
the
chapel
as
an
no
subject
could
have
been
better
adapted
to
his
genius
than
this
the
day
of
supernal
terrors
irae
dies
when
according
to
the
sentiments
of
the
middle
ages
the
doomed
were
subjected
to
every
variety
of
physical
suffering
and
when
this
agony
of
pain
rather
than
agony
of
remorse
was
expressed
in
tortured
limbs
and
in
faces
writhing
with
demoniacal
despair
such
was
the
variety
of
tortures
which
he
expressed
showing
an
unexampled
richness
in
imaginative
powers
that
people
came
to
see
it
from
the
remotest
parts
of
italy
it
made
a
great
sensation
like
the
appearance
of
an
immortal
poem
and
was
magnificently
rewarded
for
the
painter
received
a
pension
of
twelve
hundred
golden
crowns
a
year
a
great
sum
in
that
age
but
michael
angelo
did
not
paint
many
pieces
he
confined
himself
chiefly
to
cartoons
and
designs
which
scattered
far
and
wide
were
reproduced
by
other
artists
his
most
famous
cartoon
was
the
battle
of
pisa
the
one
executed
for
the
ducal
palace
of
florence
as
pendant
to
one
by
leonardo
da
vinci
then
in
the
height
of
his
fame
this
picture
was
so
remarkable
for
the
accuracy
of
drawing
and
the
variety
and
form
of
expression
that
raphael
came
to
florence
on
purpose
to
study
it
and
it
was
the
power
of
giving
boldness
and
dignity
and
variety
to
the
human
figure
as
shown
in
this
painting
which
constitutes
his
great
originality
and
transcendent
excellence
the
great
creations
of
the
painters
in
modern
times
as
well
as
in
the
ancient
are
those
which
represent
the
human
figure
in
its
ideal
excellence
which
of
course
implies
what
is
most
perfect
not
in
any
one
man
or
woman
but
in
men
and
women
collectively
hence
the
greatest
of
painters
rarely
have
stooped
to
landscape
painting
since
no
imaginary
landscape
can
surpass
what
everybody
has
seen
in
nature
you
can
not
improve
on
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
or
the
gilded
clouds
of
sunset
or
the
shadows
of
the
mountain
or
the
graceful
form
of
trees
or
the
varied
tints
of
leaves
and
flowers
but
you
can
represent
the
figure
of
a
man
or
woman
more
beautiful
than
any
one
man
or
woman
that
has
ever
appeared
what
mortal
woman
ever
expressed
the
ethereal
beauty
depicted
in
a
madonna
of
raphael
or
murillo
and
what
man
ever
had
such
a
sublimity
of
aspect
and
figure
as
the
creations
of
michael
angelo
why
a
beggar
says
one
of
his
greatest
critics
arose
from
his
hand
the
patriarch
of
poverty
the
hump
of
his
dwarf
is
impressed
with
dignity
his
infants
are
men
and
his
men
are
giants
and
says
another
critic
he
is
the
inventor
of
epic
painting
in
that
sublime
circle
of
the
sistine
chapel
which
exhibits
the
origin
progress
and
final
dispensation
of
the
theocracy
he
has
personified
motion
in
the
cartoon
of
pisa
portrayed
meditation
in
the
prophets
and
sibyls
of
the
sistine
chapel
and
in
the
last
judgment
traced
every
attitude
which
varies
the
human
body
with
every
passion
which
sways
the
human
soul
his
supremacy
is
in
the
mighty
soaring
of
his
intellectual
conceptions
marvellous
as
a
creator
like
shakspeare
profound
and
solemn
like
dante
representing
power
even
in
repose
and
giving
to
the
cyclopean
forms
which
he
has
called
into
being
a
charm
of
moral
excellence
which
secures
our
sympathy
a
firm
believer
in
a
supreme
and
personal
god
disciplined
in
worldly
trials
and
glowing
in
lofty
conceptions
of
justice
he
delights
in
portraying
the
stern
prophets
of
israel
surrounded
with
an
atmosphere
of
holiness
yet
breathing
compassion
on
those
whom
they
denounce
august
in
dignity
yet
melting
with
tenderness
solemn
sad
profound
thus
was
his
influence
pure
and
exalted
in
an
art
which
has
too
often
been
prostituted
to
please
the
perverted
taste
of
a
sensual
age
the
most
refined
and
expressive
of
all
the
arts
as
it
sometimes
is
and
always
should
be
is
the
one
which
oftenest
appeals
to
that
which
christianity
teaches
us
to
shun
you
may
say
evil
to
him
who
evil
thinks
especially
ye
pure
and
immaculate
persons
who
have
walked
uncorrupted
amid
the
galleries
of
paris
dresden
florence
and
rome
but
i
fancy
that
pictures
like
books
are
what
we
choose
to
make
them
and
that
the
more
exquisite
the
art
by
which
vice
is
divested
of
its
grossness
but
not
of
its
subtle
poisons
like
the
new
héloïse
of
rousseau
or
the
wilhelm
meister
of
goethe
the
more
fatally
will
it
lead
astray
by
the
insidious
entrance
of
an
evil
spirit
in
the
guise
of
an
angel
of
light
art
like
literature
is
neither
good
nor
evil
abstractly
but
may
become
a
savor
of
death
unto
death
as
well
as
of
life
unto
life
you
can
not
extinguish
it
without
destroying
one
of
the
noblest
developments
of
civilization
but
you
can
not
have
civilization
without
multiplying
the
temptations
of
human
society
and
hence
must
be
guarded
from
those
destructive
cankers
which
as
in
old
rome
eat
out
the
virtues
on
which
the
strength
of
man
is
based
the
old
apostles
and
other
great
benefactors
of
the
world
attached
more
value
to
the
truths
which
elevate
than
to
the
arts
which
soften
it
was
the
noble
direction
which
michael
angelo
gave
to
art
which
made
him
a
great
benefactor
not
only
of
civilization
but
also
of
art
by
linking
with
it
the
eternal
ideas
of
majesty
and
dignity
as
well
as
the
truths
which
are
taught
by
divine
inspiration
another
illustration
of
the
profound
reverence
which
the
great
master
minds
of
the
world
like
augustine
pascal
and
bacon
have
ever
expressed
for
the
ideas
which
were
revealed
by
christianity
and
the
old
prophets
of
jehovah
ideas
which
many
bright
but
inferior
intellects
in
their
egotistical
arrogance
have
sought
to
subvert
yet
it
was
neither
as
sculptor
nor
painter
that
michael
angelo
left
the
most
enduring
influence
but
as
architect
painting
and
sculpture
are
the
exclusive
ornaments
and
possession
of
the
rich
and
favored
but
architecture
concerns
all
men
and
most
men
have
something
to
do
with
it
in
the
course
of
their
lives
what
boots
it
that
a
man
pays
two
thousand
pounds
for
a
picture
to
be
shut
up
in
his
library
and
probably
more
valued
for
its
rarity
or
from
the
caprices
of
fashion
than
for
its
real
merits
but
it
is
something
when
a
nation
pays
a
million
for
a
ridiculous
building
without
regard
to
the
object
for
which
it
is
intended
to
be
observed
and
criticised
by
everybody
and
for
succeeding
generations
a
good
picture
is
the
admiration
of
a
few
a
magnificent
edifice
is
the
pride
of
thousands
a
picture
necessarily
cultivates
the
taste
of
a
family
circle
a
public
edifice
educates
the
minds
of
millions
even
the
moses
of
michael
angelo
is
a
mere
object
of
interest
to
those
who
visit
the
church
of
san
pietro
in
vincoli
but
peter
is
a
monument
to
be
seen
by
large
populations
from
generation
to
generation
all
london
contemplates
paul
church
or
the
palace
of
westminster
but
the
national
gallery
may
be
visited
by
a
small
fraction
of
the
people
only
once
a
year
of
the
thousands
who
stand
before
the
tuileries
or
the
madeleine
not
one
in
a
hundred
has
visited
the
gallery
of
the
louvre
what
material
works
of
man
so
grand
as
those
hoary
monuments
of
piety
or
pride
erected
three
thousand
years
ago
and
still
magnificent
in
their
very
ruins
how
imposing
are
the
pyramids
the
coliseum
and
the
gothic
cathedrals
of
the
middle
ages
and
even
when
architecture
does
not
rear
vaulted
roofs
and
arches
and
pinnacles
or
tower
to
dazzling
heights
or
inspire
reverential
awe
from
the
associations
which
cluster
around
it
how
interesting
are
even
its
minor
triumphs
who
does
not
stop
to
admire
a
beautiful
window
or
porch
or
portico
who
does
not
criticise
his
neighbor
house
its
proportions
its
general
effect
its
adaptation
to
the
uses
designed
architecture
never
wearies
us
for
its
wonders
are
inexhaustible
they
appeal
to
the
common
eye
and
have
reference
to
the
necessities
of
man
and
sometimes
express
the
consecrated
sentiments
of
an
age
or
a
nation
nor
can
it
be
prostituted
like
painting
and
sculpture
it
never
corrupts
the
mind
and
sometimes
inspires
it
and
if
it
makes
an
appeal
to
the
senses
or
the
imagination
it
is
to
kindle
perceptions
of
the
severe
beauty
of
geometrical
forms
whoever
then
has
done
anything
in
architecture
has
contributed
to
the
necessities
of
man
and
stimulated
an
admiration
for
what
is
venerable
and
magnificent
now
michael
angelo
was
not
only
the
architect
of
numerous
palaces
and
churches
but
also
one
of
the
principal
architects
of
that
great
edifice
which
is
on
the
whole
the
noblest
church
in
christendom
a
perpetual
marvel
and
study
not
faultless
but
so
imposing
that
it
will
long
remain
like
the
old
temple
of
ephesus
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
world
he
completed
the
church
without
great
deviation
from
the
plan
of
the
first
architect
bramante
whom
he
regarded
as
the
greatest
architect
that
had
lived
altering
plans
from
a
latin
to
a
greek
cross
the
former
of
which
was
retained
after
michael
angelo
death
but
it
is
the
interior
rather
than
the
exterior
of
peter
which
shows
its
vast
superiority
over
all
other
churches
for
splendor
and
effect
and
surprises
all
who
are
even
fresh
from
cologne
and
milan
and
westminster
it
impresses
us
like
a
wonder
of
nature
rather
than
as
the
work
of
man
a
great
work
of
engineering
as
well
as
a
marvel
of
majesty
and
beauty
we
are
surprised
to
see
so
vast
a
structure
covering
nearly
five
acres
so
elaborately
finished
nothing
neglected
the
lofty
walls
covered
with
precious
marbles
the
side
chapels
filled
with
statues
and
monuments
the
altars
ornamented
with
pictures
and
those
pictures
not
painted
in
oil
but
copied
in
mosaic
so
that
they
will
neither
decay
nor
fade
but
last
till
destroyed
by
violence
what
feelings
overpower
the
poetic
mind
when
the
glories
of
that
interior
first
blaze
upon
the
brain
what
a
world
of
brightness
softness
and
richness
what
grandeur
solidity
and
strength
what
unnumbered
treasures
around
the
altars
what
grand
mosaics
relieve
the
height
of
the
wondrous
dome
larger
than
the
pantheon
rising
two
hundred
feet
from
the
intersection
of
those
lofty
and
massive
piers
which
divide
transept
from
choir
and
nave
what
effect
of
magnitude
after
the
eye
gets
accustomed
to
the
vast
proportions
oh
what
silence
reigns
around
how
difficult
even
for
the
sonorous
chants
of
choristers
and
priests
to
disturb
that
silence
to
be
more
than
echoes
of
a
distant
music
which
seems
to
come
from
the
very
courts
of
heaven
itself
to
some
a
holy
sanctuary
where
one
may
meditate
among
crowds
and
feel
alone
where
one
breathes
an
atmosphere
which
changes
not
with
heat
or
cold
and
where
the
lamps
and
clouds
of
incense
diffusing
the
fragrance
of
the
east
and
the
rich
dresses
of
the
mitred
priests
and
the
unnumbered
symbols
suggest
the
ritualism
of
that
imposing
worship
when
solomon
dedicated
to
jehovah
the
grandest
temple
of
antiquity
truly
was
peter
church
the
last
great
achievement
of
the
popes
the
crowning
demonstration
of
their
temporal
dominion
suggestive
of
their
wealth
and
power
a
marble
history
of
pride
and
pomp
a
fitting
emblem
of
that
worship
which
appeals
to
sense
rather
than
to
god
and
singular
it
was
when
the
great
artist
reared
that
gigantic
pile
even
though
it
symbolized
the
cross
he
really
gave
a
vital
wound
to
that
cause
to
which
he
consecrated
his
noblest
energies
for
its
lofty
dome
could
not
be
completed
without
the
contributions
of
christendom
and
those
contributions
could
not
be
made
without
an
appeal
to
false
principles
which
entered
into
mediaeval
catholicism
even
penance
and
which
stirred
the
holy
indignation
of
a
man
who
knew
and
declared
on
what
different
ground
justification
should
be
based
thus
was
luther
in
one
sense
called
into
action
by
the
labors
of
michael
angelo
thus
was
the
erection
of
peter
church
overruled
in
the
preaching
of
reformers
who
would
show
that
the
money
obtained
by
the
sale
of
indulgences
for
sin
could
never
purchase
an
acceptable
offering
to
god
even
though
the
monument
were
filled
with
christian
emblems
and
consecrated
by
those
prayers
and
anthems
which
had
been
the
life
of
blessed
saints
and
martyrs
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
peter
is
not
gothic
it
is
a
restoration
of
the
greek
it
belongs
to
what
artists
call
the
renaissance
a
style
of
architecture
marked
by
a
return
to
the
classical
models
of
antiquity
michael
angelo
brought
back
to
civilization
the
old
ideas
of
grecian
grace
and
roman
majesty
typical
of
the
original
inspirations
of
the
men
who
lived
in
the
quiet
admiration
of
eternal
beauty
and
grace
the
men
who
built
the
parthenon
and
who
shaped
pillars
and
capitals
and
entablatures
in
the
severest
proportions
and
fitted
them
with
ornaments
drawn
from
the
living
world
plants
and
animals
especially
images
of
god
highest
work
even
of
man
and
of
man
not
worn
and
macerated
and
dismal
and
monstrous
but
of
man
when
most
resplendent
in
the
perfections
of
the
primeval
strength
and
beauty
he
returned
to
a
style
which
classical
antiquity
carried
to
great
perfection
but
which
had
been
neglected
by
the
new
teutonic
nations
nor
is
there
evidence
that
michael
angelo
disdained
the
creations
especially
seen
in
those
gothic
monuments
which
are
still
the
objects
of
our
admiration
who
does
not
admire
the
church
architecture
of
the
middle
ages
of
its
kind
it
has
never
been
surpassed
geometry
and
art
the
true
and
the
beautiful
meet
nothing
ever
erected
by
the
hand
of
man
surpasses
the
more
famous
cathedrals
of
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
in
the
richness
and
variety
of
their
symbolic
decorations
they
typify
the
great
ideas
of
christianity
they
inspire
feelings
of
awe
and
reverence
they
are
astonishing
structures
in
their
magnitude
and
in
their
effect
monuments
are
they
of
religious
zeal
and
poetical
inspiration
the
creations
of
great
artists
although
we
scarcely
know
their
names
adapted
to
the
uses
designed
the
expression
of
consecrated
sentiments
the
marble
history
of
the
ages
in
which
they
were
erected
now
heavy
and
sombre
when
society
was
enslaved
and
mournful
and
then
cheerful
and
lofty
when
christianity
was
joyful
and
triumphant
who
ever
was
satisfied
in
contemplating
the
diversified
wonders
of
those
venerable
structures
who
would
lose
the
impression
which
almost
overwhelmed
the
mind
when
york
minster
or
cologne
or
milan
or
amiens
was
first
beheld
with
their
lofty
spires
and
towers
their
sculptured
pinnacles
their
flying
buttresses
their
vaulted
roofs
their
long
arcades
their
purple
windows
their
holy
altars
their
symbolic
carvings
their
majestic
outlines
their
grand
proportions
but
beautiful
imposing
poetical
and
venerable
as
are
these
hoary
piles
they
are
not
the
all
in
all
of
art
suppose
all
the
buildings
of
europe
the
last
four
hundred
years
had
been
modelled
from
these
churches
how
gloomy
would
be
our
streets
how
dark
and
dingy
our
shops
how
dismal
our
dwellings
how
inconvenient
our
hotels
a
new
style
was
needed
at
least
as
a
supplement
of
the
old
as
lances
and
shields
were
giving
place
to
and
the
line
and
the
plummet
for
the
mariner
compass
as
a
new
civilization
was
creating
new
wants
and
developing
the
material
necessities
of
man
so
michael
angelo
arose
and
revived
the
imperishable
models
of
the
classical
ages
to
be
applied
not
merely
to
churches
but
to
palaces
civic
halls
theatres
libraries
museums
banks
all
of
which
have
mundane
purposes
the
material
world
had
need
of
conveniences
as
much
as
the
mediaeval
age
had
need
of
shrines
humanity
was
to
be
developed
as
well
as
the
deity
to
be
worshipped
the
artist
took
the
broadest
views
looking
upon
gothic
architecture
as
but
one
division
of
art
even
as
truth
is
greater
than
any
system
and
christianity
wider
than
any
sect
o
how
this
shakspeare
of
art
would
have
smiled
on
the
vague
and
transcendental
panegyrics
of
michelet
or
ruskin
and
other
sentimental
admirers
of
an
age
which
never
can
return
and
how
he
might
have
laughed
at
some
modern
enthusiasts
who
trace
religion
to
the
disposition
of
stones
and
arches
forgetting
that
religion
is
an
inspiration
which
comes
from
god
and
never
from
the
work
of
hands
which
can
be
only
a
form
of
idolatry
michael
angelo
found
that
the
ornamentations
of
the
ancient
temples
were
as
rich
and
varied
as
those
of
mediaeval
churches
mouldings
were
discovered
of
incomparable
elegance
the
figures
on
entablatures
were
found
to
be
chiselled
accurately
from
nature
the
pillars
were
of
matchless
proportions
the
capitals
of
graceful
curvatures
he
saw
beauty
in
the
horizontal
lines
of
the
parthenon
as
much
as
in
the
vertical
lines
of
cologne
he
would
not
pull
down
the
venerable
monuments
of
religious
zeal
but
he
would
add
to
them
because
the
pointed
arch
was
sacred
he
would
not
despise
the
humble
office
of
the
lintel
and
in
southern
climates
especially
there
was
no
need
of
those
steep
gothic
roofs
which
were
intended
to
prevent
a
great
weight
of
rain
and
snow
and
where
the
graceful
portico
of
the
greeks
was
more
appropriate
than
the
heavy
tower
of
the
lombards
he
would
seize
on
everything
that
the
genius
of
past
ages
had
indorsed
even
as
christianity
itself
appropriates
everything
human
science
art
music
poetry
eloquence
literature
sanctifies
it
and
dedicates
it
to
the
lord
not
for
the
pride
of
priests
but
for
the
improvement
of
humanity
civilization
may
exist
with
paganism
but
only
performs
its
highest
uses
when
tributary
to
christianity
and
christianity
accepts
the
tribute
which
even
pagan
civilization
offers
for
the
adornment
of
our
race
expelled
from
paradise
and
doomed
to
hard
and
bitter
toils
without
abdicating
her
more
glorious
office
of
raising
the
soul
to
heaven
nor
was
michael
angelo
responsible
for
the
vile
mongrel
architecture
which
followed
the
renaissance
and
which
disfigures
the
modern
capitals
of
europe
any
more
than
for
the
perversion
of
painting
in
the
hands
of
titian
but
the
indiscriminate
adoption
of
pillars
for
humble
houses
shops
with
roman
arches
spires
and
towers
erected
on
grecian
porticoes
are
no
worse
than
schoolhouses
built
like
convents
and
chapels
designed
for
preaching
as
much
as
for
choral
chants
made
dark
and
gloomy
where
the
voice
of
the
preacher
is
lost
and
wasted
amid
vaulted
roofs
and
useless
pillars
michael
angelo
encouraged
no
incongruities
he
himself
conceived
the
beautiful
and
the
true
and
admired
it
wherever
found
even
amid
the
excavations
of
ruined
cities
he
may
have
overrated
the
buried
monuments
of
ancient
art
but
how
was
he
to
escape
the
universal
enthusiasm
of
his
age
for
the
remains
of
a
glorious
and
forgotten
civilization
perhaps
his
mind
was
wearied
with
the
middle
ages
from
which
he
had
nothing
more
to
learn
and
sought
a
greater
fulness
and
a
more
perfect
unity
in
the
expanding
forces
of
a
new
and
grander
era
than
was
ever
seen
by
pagan
heroes
or
by
gothic
saints
but
i
need
not
expatiate
on
the
new
ideas
which
michael
angelo
accepted
or
the
impulse
he
gave
to
art
in
all
its
forms
and
to
the
revival
of
which
civilization
is
so
much
indebted
let
us
turn
and
give
a
parting
look
at
the
man
that
great
creative
genius
who
had
no
superior
in
his
day
and
generation
like
the
greatest
of
all
italians
he
is
interesting
for
his
grave
experiences
his
dreary
isolations
his
vast
attainments
his
creative
imagination
and
his
lofty
moral
sentiments
like
dante
he
stands
apart
from
and
superior
to
all
other
men
of
his
age
he
never
could
sport
with
jesters
or
laugh
with
buffoons
or
chat
with
fools
and
because
of
this
he
seemed
to
be
haughty
and
disdainful
like
luther
he
had
no
time
for
frivolities
and
looked
upon
himself
as
commissioned
to
do
important
work
he
rejoiced
in
labor
and
knew
no
rest
until
he
was
he
ate
that
he
might
live
not
lived
that
he
might
eat
for
seventeen
years
after
he
was
he
worked
on
church
worked
without
pay
that
he
might
render
to
god
his
last
earthly
tribute
without
alloy
as
religious
as
those
unknown
artists
who
erected
rheims
and
westminster
he
was
modest
and
patient
yet
could
not
submit
to
the
insolence
of
little
men
in
power
he
even
left
the
papal
palace
in
disdain
when
he
found
his
labors
unappreciated
julius
ii
was
forced
to
bend
to
the
stern
artist
not
the
artist
to
the
pope
yet
when
leo
sent
him
to
quarry
marbles
for
nine
years
he
submitted
without
complaint
he
had
no
craving
for
riches
like
rubens
no
love
of
luxury
like
raphael
no
envy
like
da
vinci
he
never
his
brain
or
suffered
himself
like
raphael
who
died
exhausted
at
to
crowd
three
days
into
one
knowing
that
exhausts
the
nervous
energies
and
shortens
life
he
never
attempted
to
open
the
doors
which
providence
had
plainly
shut
against
him
but
waited
patiently
for
his
day
knowing
it
would
come
yet
whether
it
came
or
not
it
was
all
the
same
to
him
a
man
with
all
the
holy
rapture
of
a
kepler
and
all
the
glorious
of
a
newton
he
was
indeed
jealous
of
his
fame
but
he
was
not
greedy
of
admiration
he
worked
without
the
stimulus
of
praise
one
of
the
rarest
things
urged
on
purely
by
love
of
art
he
loved
art
for
its
own
sake
as
good
men
love
virtue
as
palestrina
loved
music
as
bacon
loved
truth
as
kant
loved
philosophy
satisfied
with
itself
as
its
own
reward
he
disliked
to
be
patronized
but
always
remembered
benefits
and
loved
the
tribute
of
respect
and
admiration
even
as
he
scorned
the
empty
flatterer
of
fashion
he
was
the
soul
of
sincerity
as
well
as
of
magnanimity
and
hence
had
great
capacity
for
friendship
as
well
as
great
power
of
his
friendship
with
vittoria
colonna
is
as
memorable
as
that
of
jerome
and
paula
or
that
of
hildebrand
and
the
countess
matilda
he
was
a
great
patriot
and
clung
to
his
native
florence
with
peculiar
affection
living
in
habits
of
intimacy
with
princes
and
cardinals
he
never
addressed
them
in
adulatory
language
but
talked
and
acted
like
a
nobleman
of
nature
whose
inborn
and
superior
greatness
could
be
tested
only
by
the
ages
he
placed
art
on
the
highest
pinnacle
of
the
temple
of
humanity
but
dedicated
that
temple
to
the
god
of
heaven
in
whom
he
believed
his
person
was
not
commanding
but
intelligence
radiated
from
his
features
and
his
earnest
nature
commanded
respect
in
childhood
he
was
feeble
but
temperance
made
him
strong
he
believed
that
no
bodily
decay
was
incompatible
with
intellectual
improvement
he
continued
his
studies
until
he
died
and
felt
that
he
had
mastered
nothing
he
was
always
dissatisfied
with
his
own
productions
was
his
motto
as
alp
on
alp
arose
upon
his
view
his
studies
were
diversified
and
vast
he
wrote
poetry
as
well
as
carved
stone
his
sonnets
especially
holding
a
high
rank
he
was
engineer
as
well
as
architect
and
fortified
florence
against
her
enemies
when
old
he
showed
all
the
fire
of
youth
and
his
eye
like
that
of
moses
never
became
dim
since
his
strength
and
his
beauty
were
of
the
soul
ever
expanding
ever
adoring
his
temper
was
stern
but
affectionate
he
had
no
mercy
on
a
fool
or
a
dunce
and
turned
in
disgust
from
those
who
loved
trifles
and
lies
he
was
guilty
of
no
immoralities
like
raphael
and
titian
being
universally
venerated
for
his
stern
integrity
and
allegiance
to
duty
as
one
who
believes
that
there
really
is
a
god
to
whom
he
is
personally
responsible
he
gave
away
his
riches
like
ambrose
and
gregory
valuing
money
only
as
a
means
of
usefulness
sickened
with
the
world
he
still
labored
for
the
world
and
died
in
over
years
of
age
in
the
full
assurance
of
eternal
blessedness
in
heaven
his
marbles
may
crumble
down
in
spite
of
all
that
we
can
do
to
preserve
them
as
models
of
hopeless
imitation
but
the
exalted
ideas
he
sought
to
represent
by
them
are
imperishable
and
divine
and
will
be
subjects
of
contemplation
when
seas
shall
waste
the
skies
to
smoke
decay
rocks
fall
to
dust
and
mountains
melt
away

martin
luther
the
protestant
reformation
among
great
benefactors
martin
luther
is
one
of
the
most
illustrious
he
headed
the
protestant
reformation
this
movement
is
so
completely
interlinked
with
the
literature
the
religion
the
education
the
prosperity
yea
even
the
political
history
of
europe
that
it
is
the
most
important
and
interesting
of
all
modern
historical
changes
it
is
a
subject
of
such
amazing
magnitude
that
no
one
can
claim
to
be
well
informed
who
does
not
know
its
leading
issues
and
developments
as
it
spread
from
germany
to
switzerland
france
holland
sweden
england
and
scotland
the
central
and
prominent
figure
in
the
movement
is
luther
but
the
way
was
prepared
for
him
by
a
host
of
illustrious
men
in
different
countries
by
savonarola
in
italy
by
huss
and
jerome
in
bohemia
by
erasmus
in
holland
by
wyclif
in
england
and
by
sundry
others
who
detested
the
corruptions
they
ridiculed
and
lamented
but
could
not
remove
how
flagrant
those
evils
who
can
deny
them
the
papal
despotism
and
the
frauds
on
which
it
was
based
monastic
corruptions
penance
and
indulgences
for
sin
and
the
sale
of
them
more
shameful
still
the
secular
character
of
the
clergy
the
pomp
wealth
and
arrogance
of
bishops
auricular
confession
celibacy
of
the
clergy
their
idle
and
dissolute
lives
their
ignorance
and
superstition
the
worship
of
the
images
of
saints
and
masses
for
the
dead
the
gorgeous
ritualism
of
the
mass
the
substitution
of
legends
for
the
scriptures
which
were
not
translated
or
read
by
the
people
pilgrimages
processions
idle
pomps
and
the
multiplication
of
holy
days
above
all
the
grinding
spiritual
despotism
exercised
by
priests
with
their
inquisitions
and
excommunications
all
centring
in
the
terrible
usurpation
of
the
popes
keeping
the
human
mind
in
bondage
and
suppressing
all
intellectual
independence
these
evils
prevailed
everywhere
i
say
nothing
here
of
the
massacres
the
poisonings
the
assassinations
the
fornications
the
abominations
of
which
history
accuses
many
of
the
pontiffs
who
sat
on
papal
thrones
such
evils
did
not
stare
the
german
and
english
in
the
face
as
they
did
the
italians
in
the
fifteenth
century
in
germany
the
vices
were
mediaeval
and
monkish
not
the
unblushing
infidelity
and
levities
of
the
renaissance
which
made
a
radical
reformation
in
italy
impossible
in
germany
and
england
there
was
left
among
the
people
the
power
of
conscience
a
rough
earnestness
of
character
the
sense
of
moral
accountability
and
a
fear
of
divine
judgment
luther
was
just
the
man
for
his
work
sprung
from
the
people
poor
popular
fervent
educated
amid
privations
religious
by
nature
yet
with
exuberant
animal
spirits
dogmatic
boisterous
intrepid
with
a
great
insight
into
realities
practical
untiring
learned
generally
cheerful
and
hopeful
emancipated
from
the
terrors
of
the
middle
ages
scorning
the
middle
ages
progressive
in
his
spirit
lofty
in
his
character
earnest
in
his
piety
believing
in
the
future
and
in
god
such
was
the
great
leader
of
this
emancipating
movement
he
was
not
so
learned
as
erasmus
nor
so
logical
as
calvin
nor
so
scholarly
as
melancthon
nor
so
broad
as
cranmer
he
was
not
a
polished
man
he
was
often
offensively
rude
and
brusque
and
lavish
of
epithets
nor
was
he
what
we
call
a
modest
and
humble
man
he
was
intellectually
proud
disdainful
and
sometimes
when
irritated
abusive
none
of
his
pictures
represent
him
as
a
man
scarcely
intellectual
but
coarse
and
sensual
rather
as
socrates
seemed
to
the
athenians
but
with
these
defects
and
drawbacks
he
had
just
such
traits
and
gifts
as
fitted
him
to
lead
a
great
popular
movement
bold
audacious
with
deep
convictions
and
rapid
intellectual
processes
prompt
decided
generous
brave
in
sympathy
with
the
people
eloquent
herculean
in
energies
with
an
amazing
power
of
work
electrical
in
his
smile
and
in
his
words
and
always
ready
for
contingencies
had
he
been
more
polished
more
of
a
gentleman
more
fastidious
more
scrupulous
more
ascetic
more
modest
he
would
have
shrunk
from
his
tasks
he
would
have
lost
the
elasticity
of
his
mind
he
would
have
been
discouraged
even
saint
augustine
a
broader
and
more
catholic
man
than
luther
could
not
have
done
his
work
he
was
a
sort
of
converted
mirabeau
he
loved
the
storms
of
battle
he
impersonated
revolutionary
ideas
but
he
was
a
man
of
thought
as
well
as
of
action
luther
origin
was
of
the
humblest
born
in
eisleben
the
son
of
a
poor
peasant
his
childhood
was
spent
in
penury
he
was
religious
from
a
boy
he
was
religious
when
he
sang
hymns
for
a
living
from
house
to
house
before
the
people
of
mansfield
while
at
school
there
and
also
at
the
schools
of
magdeburg
and
eisenach
where
he
still
earned
his
bread
by
his
voice
his
devotional
character
and
his
music
gained
for
him
a
friend
who
helped
him
through
his
studies
till
at
the
age
of
eighteen
he
entered
the
university
at
erfurt
where
he
distinguished
himself
in
the
classics
and
the
mediaeval
philosophy
and
here
his
religious
meditations
led
him
to
enter
the
augustinian
monastery
he
entered
that
strict
retreat
as
others
did
to
lead
a
religious
life
the
great
question
of
all
time
pressed
upon
his
mind
with
peculiar
force
what
shall
a
man
give
in
exchange
for
his
soul
and
it
shows
that
religious
life
in
germany
still
burned
in
many
a
heart
in
spite
of
the
corruptions
of
the
church
that
a
young
man
like
luther
should
seek
the
shades
of
monastic
seclusion
for
meditation
and
study
he
was
a
monk
like
other
monks
but
it
seems
he
had
religious
doubts
and
fears
more
than
ordinary
monks
at
first
he
conformed
to
the
customary
ways
of
men
seeking
salvation
he
walked
in
the
beaten
road
like
saint
dominic
and
saint
francis
he
accepted
the
great
ideas
of
the
middle
ages
which
he
was
afterwards
to
repudiate
he
was
not
beyond
them
or
greater
than
they
were
at
first
he
fasted
like
monks
and
tormented
his
body
with
austerities
as
they
did
from
the
time
of
benedict
he
sang
in
the
choir
from
early
morn
and
practised
the
usual
severities
but
his
doubts
and
fears
remained
he
did
not
like
other
monks
find
peace
and
consolation
he
did
not
become
seraphic
like
saint
francis
or
bonaventura
or
loyola
perhaps
his
nature
repelled
asceticism
perhaps
his
inquiring
and
original
mind
wanted
something
better
and
surer
to
rest
upon
than
the
dreams
and
visions
of
a
traditionary
piety
had
he
been
satisfied
with
the
ordinary
mode
of
propitiating
the
deity
he
would
never
have
emerged
from
his
retreat
to
a
scholar
the
monastery
had
great
attractions
even
in
that
age
it
was
still
invested
with
poetic
associations
and
consecrated
usages
it
was
indorsed
by
the
venerable
fathers
of
the
church
it
was
favorable
to
study
and
free
from
the
noisy
turmoil
of
the
world
but
with
all
these
advantages
luther
was
miserable
he
felt
the
agonies
of
an
unforgiven
soul
in
quest
of
peace
with
god
he
could
not
get
rid
of
them
they
pursued
him
into
the
immensity
of
an
intolerable
night
he
was
in
despair
what
could
austerities
do
for
he
hungered
and
thirsted
after
the
truth
like
saint
augustine
in
milan
he
had
no
taste
for
philosophy
but
he
wanted
the
repose
that
philosophers
pretended
to
teach
he
was
then
too
narrow
to
read
plato
or
boëthius
he
was
a
monk
without
relief
he
suffered
all
that
saint
paul
suffered
at
tarsus
in
some
respects
this
monastic
pietism
resembled
the
pharisaism
of
saul
in
the
schools
of
tarsus
a
technical
rigid
and
painful
adherence
to
rules
fastings
obtrusive
prayers
and
petty
ritualisms
which
form
the
essence
and
substance
of
all
pharisaism
and
all
monastic
life
based
on
the
enormous
error
that
man
deserves
heaven
by
external
practices
in
which
however
he
can
never
perfect
himself
though
he
were
to
live
like
simeon
stylites
on
the
top
of
a
pillar
for
twenty
years
without
once
descending
an
eternal
unrest
because
perfection
can
not
be
attained
the
most
terrible
slavery
to
which
a
man
can
be
conscientiously
doomed
verging
into
hypocrisy
and
fanaticism
it
was
then
that
a
kind
and
enlightened
friend
visited
him
and
recommended
him
to
read
the
bible
the
bible
never
has
been
a
sealed
book
to
monks
it
was
ever
highly
prized
no
convent
was
without
it
but
it
was
read
with
the
spectacles
of
the
middle
ages
repentance
meant
penance
in
saint
paul
epistles
luther
discovers
the
true
ground
of
justification
not
works
but
faith
for
paul
had
passed
through
similar
experiences
works
are
good
but
faith
is
the
gift
of
god
works
are
imperfect
with
the
best
of
men
even
the
highest
form
of
works
to
a
mediaeval
eye
and
penance
but
faith
is
infinite
radiating
from
divine
love
faith
is
a
boundless
joy
salvation
by
the
grace
of
god
his
everlasting
and
precious
boon
to
people
who
can
not
climb
to
heaven
on
their
hands
and
knees
the
highest
gift
which
god
ever
bestowed
on
men
eternal
life
luther
is
thus
emancipated
from
the
ideas
of
the
middle
ages
and
of
the
old
syriac
monks
and
of
the
jewish
pharisees
in
his
deliverance
he
has
new
hopes
and
aspirations
he
becomes
cheerful
and
devotes
himself
to
his
studies
nothing
can
make
a
man
more
cheerful
and
joyful
than
the
cordial
reception
of
a
gift
which
is
infinite
a
blessing
which
is
too
priceless
to
be
bought
the
pharisee
the
monk
the
ritualist
is
gloomy
ascetic
severe
intolerant
for
he
is
not
quite
sure
of
his
salvation
a
man
who
accepts
heaven
as
a
gift
is
full
of
divine
enthusiasm
like
saint
augustine
luther
now
comprehends
augustine
the
great
doctor
of
the
church
embraces
his
philosophy
and
sees
how
much
it
has
been
misunderstood
the
rare
attainments
and
interesting
character
of
luther
are
at
last
recognized
he
is
made
a
professor
of
divinity
in
the
new
university
which
the
elector
of
saxony
has
endowed
at
wittenberg
he
becomes
a
favorite
with
the
students
he
enters
into
the
life
of
the
people
he
preaches
with
wonderful
power
for
he
is
popular
earnest
original
fresh
electrical
he
is
a
monk
still
but
the
monk
is
merged
in
the
learned
doctor
and
eloquent
preacher
he
does
not
yet
even
dream
of
attacking
monastic
institutions
or
the
pope
he
is
a
good
catholic
in
his
obedience
to
authorities
but
he
hates
the
middle
ages
and
all
their
ghostly
funereal
burdensome
and
technical
religious
customs
he
is
human
almost
convivial
fond
of
music
of
poetry
of
society
of
friends
and
of
the
good
cheer
of
the
social
circle
the
people
love
luther
for
he
has
a
broad
humanity
they
never
did
love
monks
only
feared
their
maledictions
about
this
time
the
pope
was
in
great
need
of
money
this
was
leo
x
he
not
only
squandered
his
vast
revenues
in
pleasures
and
pomps
like
any
secular
monarch
he
not
only
collected
pictures
and
statues
but
he
wanted
to
complete
peter
church
it
was
the
crowning
glory
of
papal
magnificence
where
was
he
to
get
money
except
from
the
contributions
of
christendom
but
kings
and
princes
and
bishops
and
abbots
were
getting
tired
of
this
everlasting
drain
of
money
to
rome
in
the
shape
of
annats
and
taxes
so
leo
revived
an
old
custom
of
the
dark
ages
he
would
sell
indulgences
for
sin
and
he
sent
his
agents
to
peddle
them
in
every
country
the
agent
in
saxony
was
a
very
vulgar
boisterous
noisy
bullying
dominican
by
the
name
of
tetzel
luther
abhorred
him
not
so
much
because
he
was
vulgar
and
noisy
but
because
his
infamous
business
derogated
from
the
majesty
of
god
and
religion
in
wrathful
indignation
he
preached
against
tetzel
and
his
practices
the
abominable
traffic
of
indulgences
only
god
can
forgive
sins
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
an
insult
to
the
human
understanding
that
any
man
even
a
pope
should
grant
an
absolution
for
crime
these
indulgences
were
the
very
worst
form
of
penance
since
they
made
a
mockery
of
virtue
and
it
was
useless
to
preach
against
them
so
long
as
the
principles
on
which
they
were
based
were
not
assailed
everybody
believed
in
penance
everybody
believed
that
this
in
some
form
would
insure
salvation
it
consisted
in
a
temporal
penalty
or
punishment
inflicted
on
the
sinner
after
confession
to
the
priest
as
a
condition
of
his
receiving
absolution
or
an
authoritative
pardon
of
his
sin
by
the
church
as
representative
and
the
indulgence
was
originally
an
official
remission
of
this
penalty
to
be
gained
by
offerings
of
money
to
the
church
for
its
sacred
uses
however
ingenious
this
theory
the
practice
inevitably
ran
into
corruption
the
people
who
bought
the
agents
who
sold
the
popes
who
dispensed
these
indulgences
used
them
for
the
vilest
purposes
fortunately
in
those
times
in
germany
everybody
felt
he
had
a
soul
to
save
neither
the
popes
nor
the
church
ever
lost
that
idea
the
clergy
ruled
by
its
force
by
stimulating
fears
of
divine
wrath
whereby
the
wretched
sinner
would
be
physically
tormented
forever
unless
he
escaped
by
a
propitiation
of
the
deity
the
common
form
of
which
was
penance
deeds
of
supererogation
donations
to
the
church
works
of
fear
and
penitence
which
commended
themselves
to
the
piety
of
the
age
and
this
piety
luther
now
believed
to
be
unenlightened
not
the
kind
enjoined
by
christ
or
paul
so
to
instruct
his
students
and
the
people
as
to
the
true
ground
of
justification
which
he
had
worked
out
from
the
study
of
the
bible
and
saint
augustine
amid
the
agonies
of
a
tormented
conscience
luther
prepared
his
theses
those
celebrated
propositions
which
he
affixed
to
the
gates
of
the
church
of
wittenberg
and
which
excited
a
great
sensation
throughout
northern
germany
reaching
even
the
eyes
of
the
pope
himself
who
did
not
comprehend
their
tendency
but
was
struck
with
their
power
this
doctor
luther
said
he
is
a
man
of
fine
genius
the
students
of
the
university
and
the
people
generally
were
kindled
as
if
by
pentecostal
fires
the
new
invention
of
printing
scattered
those
theses
everywhere
far
and
near
they
reached
the
humble
hamlet
as
well
as
the
palaces
of
bishops
and
princes
they
excited
immediate
and
immense
enthusiasm
there
was
freshness
in
them
originality
and
great
ideas
we
can
not
wonder
at
the
enthusiasm
which
those
religious
ideas
excited
nearly
four
hundred
years
ago
when
we
reflect
that
they
were
not
cant
words
then
not
platitudes
not
dead
dogmas
but
full
of
life
and
exciting
interest
even
as
were
the
watchwords
of
rousseau
liberty
fraternity
equality
to
frenchmen
on
the
outbreak
of
their
political
revolution
and
as
those
watchwords
abstractly
true
roused
the
dormant
energies
of
the
french
to
a
terrible
conflict
against
feudalism
and
royalty
so
those
theses
of
luther
kindled
germany
into
a
living
flame
and
why
because
they
presented
more
cheerful
and
comforting
grounds
of
justification
than
had
been
preached
for
one
thousand
years
faith
rather
than
penance
for
works
hinged
on
penance
the
underlying
principle
of
those
propositions
was
divine
grace
to
save
the
world
the
principle
of
paul
and
saint
augustine
therefore
not
new
but
forgotten
a
mighty
comfort
to
miserable
people
mocked
and
cheated
and
robbed
by
a
venal
and
a
gluttonous
clergy
even
taine
admits
that
this
doctrine
of
grace
is
the
foundation
stone
of
protestantism
as
it
spread
over
europe
in
the
sixteenth
century
in
those
places
where
protestantism
is
dead
where
rationalism
or
pelagian
speculations
have
taken
its
place
this
fact
may
be
denied
but
the
history
of
northern
europe
blazes
with
it
a
fact
which
no
historian
of
any
honesty
can
deny
very
likely
those
who
are
not
in
sympathy
with
this
great
idea
of
luther
augustine
and
paul
may
ignore
the
fact
even
as
caleb
gushing
once
declared
to
me
that
the
reformation
sprang
from
the
desire
of
luther
to
marry
catherine
bora
and
that
learned
and
ingenious
sophist
overwhelmed
me
with
his
citations
from
infidel
and
ribald
catholic
writers
like
audin
greater
men
than
he
deny
that
grace
underlies
the
whole
original
movement
of
the
reformers
and
they
talk
of
the
reformation
as
a
mere
revolt
from
rome
as
a
war
against
papal
corruption
as
a
protest
against
monkery
and
the
dark
ages
brought
about
by
the
spirit
of
a
new
age
the
onward
march
of
humanity
the
necessary
progress
of
society
i
admit
the
secondary
causes
of
the
reformation
which
are
very
important
the
awakened
spirit
of
inquiry
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
revival
of
poetry
and
literature
and
art
the
breaking
up
of
feudalism
fortunate
discoveries
the
introduction
of
greek
literature
the
renaissance
the
disgusts
of
christendom
the
voice
of
martyrs
calling
aloud
from
their
funeral
pyres
yea
the
friendly
hand
of
princes
and
scholars
deploring
the
evils
of
a
corrupted
church
but
how
much
had
savonarola
or
erasmus
or
john
huss
or
the
lollards
aroused
the
enthusiasm
of
europe
great
and
noble
as
were
their
angry
and
indignant
protests
the
genius
of
the
reformation
in
its
early
stages
was
a
movement
not
a
political
or
a
moral
one
although
it
became
both
political
and
moral
its
strength
and
fervor
were
in
the
new
ideas
of
salvation
the
same
that
gave
power
to
the
early
preachers
of
christianity
not
denunciations
of
imperialism
and
slavery
and
ten
thousand
evils
which
disgraced
the
empire
but
the
proclamation
of
the
ideas
of
paul
as
to
the
grounds
of
hope
when
the
soul
should
leave
the
body
the
salvation
of
the
lord
declared
to
a
world
in
bondage
luther
kindled
the
same
religious
life
among
the
masses
that
the
apostles
did
the
same
that
wyclif
did
and
by
the
same
means
the
declaration
of
salvation
by
belief
in
the
incarnate
son
of
god
shedding
his
blood
in
infinite
love
why
see
how
this
idea
spread
through
germany
switzerland
and
france
and
took
possession
of
the
minds
of
the
english
and
scotch
yeomanry
with
all
their
stern
and
earnest
ruggedness
see
how
it
was
elaborately
expanded
by
calvin
how
it
gave
birth
to
a
new
and
strong
theology
how
it
entered
into
the
very
life
of
the
people
especially
among
the
puritans
into
the
souls
of
even
cromwell
soldiers
what
made
the
pilgrim
progress
the
most
popular
book
ever
published
in
england
because
it
reflected
the
theology
of
the
age
the
religion
of
the
people
all
based
on
theses
the
revival
of
those
old
doctrines
which
converted
the
roman
provinces
from
paganism
i
do
not
care
if
these
statements
are
denied
by
catholics
or
rationalists
or
progressive
savants
what
is
it
to
me
that
the
old
views
have
become
unfashionable
or
are
derided
or
are
dead
in
the
absorbing
materialism
of
this
epicurean
yet
brilliant
age
i
know
this
that
i
am
true
to
history
when
i
declare
that
the
glorious
reformation
in
which
we
all
profess
to
rejoice
and
which
is
the
greatest
movement
and
the
best
of
our
modern
time
susceptible
of
indefinite
application
interlinked
with
the
literature
and
the
progress
of
england
and
america
took
its
first
great
spiritual
start
from
the
ideas
of
luther
as
to
justification
this
was
the
voice
of
messenger
proclaiming
aloud
so
that
the
heavens
to
the
glorious
and
triumphant
annunciation
and
the
earth
heard
and
rejoiced
with
exceeding
joy
behold
i
send
tidings
of
salvation
it
is
grace
divine
grace
which
shall
undermine
the
throne
of
popes
and
pagans
and
reconcile
a
fallen
world
to
god
yes
it
was
a
christian
philosopher
a
theologian
a
doctor
of
divinity
working
out
in
his
cell
and
study
through
terrible
internal
storm
and
anguish
and
against
the
whole
teaching
of
monks
and
bishops
and
popes
and
universities
from
the
time
of
charlemagne
the
same
truth
which
augustine
learned
in
his
wonderful
experiences
who
started
the
reformation
in
the
right
direction
who
became
the
greatest
benefactor
of
these
modern
times
because
he
based
his
work
on
everlasting
and
positive
ideas
which
had
life
in
them
and
hope
and
the
sanction
of
divine
authority
thus
virtually
invoking
the
aid
of
god
almighty
to
bring
about
and
restore
the
true
glory
of
his
church
on
earth
a
glory
forever
to
be
identified
with
the
death
of
his
son
i
see
no
law
of
progress
here
no
natural
and
necessary
development
of
nations
i
see
only
the
light
and
power
of
individual
genius
brushing
away
the
cobwebs
and
sophistries
and
frauds
of
the
middle
ages
and
bringing
out
to
the
gaze
of
europe
the
vital
truth
which
with
supernatural
aid
made
in
old
times
the
day
of
pentecost
and
i
think
i
hear
the
emancipated
people
of
saxony
exclaim
from
the
elector
downwards
if
these
ideas
of
doctor
luther
are
true
and
we
feel
them
to
be
then
all
our
penances
have
been
worse
than
wasted
we
have
been
pagans
away
with
our
miserable
efforts
to
scale
the
heavens
let
us
accept
what
we
can
not
buy
let
us
make
our
palaces
and
our
cottages
alike
vocal
with
the
praises
of
him
whom
we
now
accept
as
our
deliverer
our
king
and
our
eternal
lord
thus
was
born
the
first
great
idea
of
the
reformation
out
of
brain
out
of
his
agonized
soul
and
sent
forth
to
conquer
and
produce
changes
most
marvellous
to
behold
it
is
not
my
object
to
discuss
the
truth
or
error
of
this
fundamental
doctrine
there
are
many
who
deny
it
even
among
protestants
i
am
not
a
controversialist
or
a
theologian
i
am
simply
an
historian
i
wish
to
show
what
is
historically
true
and
clear
and
i
defy
all
the
scholars
and
critics
of
the
world
to
prove
that
this
doctrine
is
not
the
basal
pillar
of
the
reformation
of
luther
i
wish
to
make
emphatic
the
statement
that
by
was
as
an
historical
fact
the
great
primal
idea
of
luther
not
new
but
new
to
him
and
to
his
age
i
have
now
to
show
how
this
idea
led
to
others
how
they
became
connected
together
how
they
produced
not
only
a
spiritual
movement
but
political
moral
and
intellectual
forces
until
all
europe
was
in
a
blaze
thus
far
the
agitation
under
luther
had
been
chiefly
theological
it
was
not
a
movement
against
popes
or
institutions
it
was
not
even
the
vehement
denunciation
against
sin
in
high
places
which
inflamed
the
anger
of
the
pope
against
savonarola
to
some
it
doubtless
seemed
like
the
old
controversy
between
augustine
and
pelagius
like
the
contentions
between
dominican
and
franciscan
monks
but
it
was
too
important
to
escape
the
attention
of
even
leo
although
at
first
he
gave
it
no
thought
it
was
a
dangerous
agitation
it
had
become
popular
there
was
no
telling
where
it
would
end
or
what
it
might
not
assail
it
was
deemed
necessary
to
stop
the
mouth
of
this
bold
and
intellectual
saxon
theologian
so
the
voluptuous
infidel
elegant
pope
accomplished
in
manners
and
pagan
arts
and
literature
sent
one
of
the
most
learned
men
of
the
church
which
called
him
father
to
argue
with
doctor
luther
confute
him
conquer
him
deeming
this
an
easy
task
but
the
doctor
could
not
be
silenced
his
convictions
were
grounded
on
the
rock
not
on
peter
but
on
the
rock
from
which
peter
derived
his
name
all
the
papal
legates
and
cardinals
in
the
world
could
neither
convince
nor
frighten
him
he
courted
argument
he
challenged
the
whole
church
to
refute
him
then
the
schools
took
up
the
controversy
all
that
was
imposing
in
names
in
authority
in
traditions
in
associations
was
arrayed
against
him
they
came
down
upon
him
with
the
whole
array
of
scholastic
learning
the
great
goliath
of
controversy
in
that
day
was
doctor
eck
who
challenged
the
saxon
monk
to
a
public
disputation
at
leipsic
all
germany
was
interested
the
question
at
issue
stirred
the
nation
to
its
very
depths
the
disputants
met
in
the
great
hall
of
the
palace
of
the
elector
never
before
was
seen
in
germany
such
an
array
of
doctors
and
theologians
and
dignitaries
it
rivalled
in
importance
and
dignity
the
council
of
nice
when
the
great
constantine
presided
to
settle
the
trinitarian
controversy
the
combatants
were
as
great
as
athanasius
and
arius
as
vehement
as
earnest
though
not
so
fierce
doctor
eck
was
superior
to
luther
in
reputation
in
dialectical
skill
in
scholastic
learning
he
was
the
pride
of
the
universities
luther
however
had
deeper
convictions
more
genius
greater
eloquence
and
at
that
time
he
was
modest
the
champion
of
the
schools
of
sophistries
and
authorities
of
literature
of
quibbles
refinements
and
words
soon
overwhelmed
the
saxon
monk
with
his
citations
decrees
of
councils
opinions
of
eminent
ecclesiastics
the
literature
of
the
church
its
mighty
authority
he
was
on
the
eve
of
triumph
had
the
question
been
settled
as
doctor
eck
supposed
by
authorities
as
lawyers
and
pedants
would
settle
the
question
luther
would
have
been
beaten
but
his
genius
came
to
his
aid
and
the
consciousness
of
truth
he
swept
away
the
premises
of
the
argument
he
denied
the
supreme
authority
of
popes
and
councils
and
universities
he
appealed
to
the
scriptures
as
the
only
ultimate
ground
of
authority
he
did
not
deny
authority
but
appealed
to
it
in
its
highest
form
this
was
unexpected
ground
the
church
was
not
prepared
openly
to
deny
the
authority
of
saint
paul
or
saint
peter
and
luther
if
he
did
not
gain
his
case
was
far
from
being
beaten
and
what
was
of
vital
importance
to
his
success
he
had
the
elector
and
the
people
with
him
thus
was
born
the
second
great
idea
of
the
reformation
the
authority
of
the
to
which
protestants
of
every
denomination
have
since
professed
to
cling
they
may
differ
in
the
interpretation
of
texts
and
thus
sects
and
parties
gradually
arose
who
quarrelled
about
their
meaning
but
none
of
them
deny
their
supreme
authority
all
the
issues
of
protestants
have
been
on
the
meaning
of
texts
on
the
interpretation
of
the
scriptures
to
be
settled
by
learning
and
reason
it
was
not
until
rationalism
arose
and
rejected
plain
and
obvious
declarations
of
scripture
as
inconsistent
with
reason
as
interpolations
as
uninspired
that
the
authority
of
the
scriptures
was
weakened
and
these
rationalists
and
the
land
of
luther
became
full
of
them
have
gone
infinitely
beyond
the
catholics
in
undermining
the
bible
the
catholics
never
have
taken
such
bold
ground
as
the
rationalists
respecting
the
scriptures
the
catholic
church
still
accepts
the
bible
but
explains
away
the
meaning
of
many
of
its
doctrines
the
rationalists
would
sweep
away
its
divine
authority
extinguish
faith
and
leave
the
world
in
night
satan
came
into
the
theological
school
of
the
protestants
disguised
in
the
robes
of
learned
doctors
searching
for
truth
and
took
away
the
props
of
religious
faith
this
was
worse
than
baptizing
repentance
with
the
name
of
penance
better
have
irrational
fears
of
hell
than
no
fears
at
all
for
this
latter
is
paganism
pagan
culture
and
pagan
philosophy
could
not
keep
society
together
in
the
old
roman
world
but
mediaeval
appeals
to
the
fears
of
men
did
keep
them
from
crimes
and
force
upon
them
virtues
the
triumph
of
luther
at
leipsic
was
however
incomplete
the
catholics
rallied
after
their
stunning
blow
they
said
in
substance
we
too
accept
the
scriptures
we
even
put
them
above
augustine
and
thomas
aquinas
and
the
councils
but
who
can
interpret
them
can
peasants
and
women
or
even
merchants
and
nobles
the
bible
though
inspired
is
full
of
difficulties
there
are
contradictory
texts
it
is
a
sealed
book
except
to
the
learned
only
the
church
can
reconcile
its
difficulties
and
what
we
mean
by
the
church
is
the
clergy
the
learned
clergy
acknowledging
allegiance
to
their
spiritual
head
who
in
matters
of
faith
is
also
infallible
we
can
accept
nothing
which
is
not
indorsed
by
popes
and
councils
no
matter
how
plain
the
scriptures
seem
to
be
on
certain
disputed
points
only
the
authority
of
the
church
can
enlighten
and
instruct
us
we
distrust
reason
that
is
what
you
call
reason
for
reason
can
twist
anything
and
pervert
it
but
what
the
church
says
is
true
its
collective
intelligence
is
our
supreme
law
thus
putting
papal
dogmas
above
reason
above
the
literal
and
plain
declarations
of
scripture
moreover
since
the
scriptures
are
to
be
interpreted
only
by
priests
it
is
not
a
safe
book
for
the
people
we
the
priests
will
keep
it
out
of
their
hands
they
will
get
notions
from
it
fatal
to
our
authority
they
will
become
fanatics
they
will
in
their
conceit
defy
us
then
luther
rose
more
powerful
more
eloquent
more
majestic
than
before
he
rose
superior
to
himself
what
said
he
keep
the
light
of
life
from
the
people
take
away
their
guide
to
heaven
keep
them
in
ignorance
of
what
is
most
precious
and
most
exalting
deprive
them
of
the
blessed
consolations
which
sustain
the
soul
in
trial
and
in
death
deny
the
most
palpable
truths
because
your
dignitaries
put
on
them
a
construction
to
bolster
up
their
power
what
an
abomination
what
treachery
to
heaven
what
peril
to
the
souls
of
men
besides
your
authorities
differ
augustine
takes
different
ground
from
pelagius
bernard
from
abélard
thomas
aquinas
from
dun
scotus
have
not
your
grand
councils
given
contradictory
decisions
whom
shall
we
believe
yea
the
popes
themselves
your
infallible
guides
have
they
not
at
different
times
rendered
different
decisions
what
would
gregory
say
to
the
verdicts
of
gregory
no
the
scriptures
are
the
legacy
of
the
early
church
to
universal
humanity
they
are
the
equal
and
treasured
inheritance
of
all
nations
and
tribes
and
kindreds
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
and
will
be
till
the
day
of
judgment
it
was
intended
that
they
should
be
diffused
and
that
every
one
should
read
them
and
interpret
them
each
for
himself
for
he
has
a
soul
to
save
and
he
dare
not
intrust
such
a
precious
thing
as
his
soul
into
the
keeping
of
selfish
and
ambitious
priests
take
away
the
bible
from
a
peasant
or
a
woman
or
any
layman
and
can
not
the
priest
armed
with
the
terrors
and
the
frauds
of
the
middle
ages
shut
up
his
soul
in
a
gloomy
dungeon
as
noisome
and
funereal
as
your
mediaeval
crypts
and
will
you
ye
boasted
intellectual
guides
of
the
people
extinguish
reason
in
this
world
in
reference
to
the
most
momentous
interests
what
other
guide
has
a
man
but
his
reason
and
you
would
prevent
this
very
reason
from
being
enlightened
by
the
gospel
you
would
obscure
reason
itself
by
your
traditions
o
ye
blind
leaders
of
the
blind
o
ye
legal
and
technical
men
obscuring
the
light
of
truth
o
ye
miserable
pharisees
ye
bigots
ye
selfish
priests
tenacious
of
your
power
your
inventions
your
traditions
will
ye
withhold
the
free
redemption
god
greatest
boon
salvation
by
the
blood
of
christ
offered
to
all
the
world
yea
will
you
suffer
the
people
to
perish
soul
and
body
because
you
fear
that
instructed
by
god
himself
they
will
rebel
against
your
accursed
despotism
have
you
considered
what
a
mighty
crime
you
thus
commit
against
god
against
man
ye
rule
by
an
infernal
appeal
to
the
superstitious
fears
of
men
but
how
shall
ye
yourselves
for
such
crimes
escape
the
damnation
of
that
hell
into
which
you
would
push
your
victims
unless
they
obey
no
i
say
let
the
scriptures
be
put
into
the
hands
of
everybody
let
every
one
interpret
them
for
himself
according
to
the
light
he
has
let
there
be
private
judgment
let
spiritual
liberty
be
revived
as
in
apostolic
days
then
only
will
the
people
be
emancipated
from
the
middle
ages
and
arise
in
their
power
and
majesty
and
obey
the
voice
of
enlightened
conscience
and
be
true
to
their
convictions
and
practise
the
virtues
which
christianity
commands
and
obey
god
rather
than
man
and
defy
all
sorts
of
persecution
and
martyrdom
having
a
serene
faith
in
those
blessed
promises
which
the
gospel
unfolds
then
will
the
people
become
great
after
the
conflicts
of
generations
and
put
under
their
feet
the
mockeries
and
lies
and
despotisms
which
grind
them
to
despair
thus
was
born
the
third
great
idea
of
the
reformation
out
of
brain
a
logical
sequence
from
the
first
idea
right
of
private
religious
liberty
call
it
what
you
will
a
great
inspiration
which
in
after
times
was
destined
to
march
triumphantly
over
battlefields
and
give
dignity
and
power
to
the
people
and
lead
to
the
reception
of
great
truths
obscured
by
priests
for
one
thousand
years
the
motive
of
an
irresistible
popular
progress
planting
england
with
puritans
and
scotland
with
heroes
and
france
with
martyrs
and
north
america
with
colonists
yea
kindling
a
fervid
religious
life
creating
such
men
as
knox
and
latimer
and
taylor
and
baxter
and
howe
who
owed
their
greatness
to
the
study
of
the
scriptures
at
last
put
into
every
hand
and
scattered
far
and
wide
even
to
india
and
china
can
anybody
doubt
the
marvellous
progress
of
protestant
nations
in
consequence
of
the
translation
and
circulation
of
the
scriptures
how
these
are
bound
up
with
their
national
life
and
all
their
social
habits
and
all
their
religious
aspirations
how
they
have
elevated
the
people
ten
hundred
millions
of
times
more
than
the
boasted
renaissance
which
sprang
from
apostate
and
infidel
and
pagan
italy
when
she
dug
up
the
buried
statues
of
greece
and
rome
and
revived
the
literature
and
arts
which
soften
but
do
not
save
for
private
judgment
and
religious
liberty
mean
nothing
more
and
nothing
less
than
the
unrestricted
perusal
of
the
scriptures
as
the
guide
of
life
this
right
of
private
judgment
on
which
luther
was
among
the
first
to
insist
and
of
which
certainly
he
was
the
first
great
champion
in
europe
was
in
that
age
a
very
bold
idea
as
well
as
original
it
flattered
as
well
as
stimulated
the
intellect
of
the
people
and
gave
them
dignity
it
gave
to
the
reformation
its
popular
character
it
appealed
to
the
mind
and
heart
of
christendom
it
gave
consolation
to
the
peasantry
of
europe
for
no
family
was
too
poor
to
possess
a
bible
the
greatest
possible
boon
and
treasure
read
and
pondered
in
the
evening
after
hard
labors
and
bitter
insults
read
aloud
to
the
family
circle
with
its
inexhaustible
store
of
moral
wealth
its
beautiful
and
touching
narratives
its
glorious
poetry
its
awful
prophecies
its
supernal
counsels
its
consoling
and
emancipating
truths
so
tender
and
yet
so
exalting
raising
the
soul
above
the
grim
trials
of
toil
and
poverty
into
the
realms
of
seraphic
peace
and
boundless
joy
the
bible
even
gave
hope
to
heretics
all
sects
and
parties
could
take
shelter
under
it
all
could
stand
on
the
broad
platform
of
religion
and
survey
from
it
the
wonders
and
glories
of
god
at
last
men
might
even
differ
on
important
points
of
doctrine
and
worship
and
yet
be
protestants
religious
liberty
became
as
wide
in
its
application
as
the
unity
of
the
church
it
might
create
sects
but
those
sects
would
be
all
united
as
to
the
value
of
the
scriptures
and
their
cardinal
declarations
on
this
broad
basis
john
milton
could
shake
hands
with
john
knox
and
john
locke
with
richard
baxter
and
oliver
cromwell
with
queen
elizabeth
and
lord
bacon
with
william
penn
and
bishop
butler
with
john
wesley
and
jonathan
edwards
with
doctor
channing
this
idea
of
private
judgment
is
what
separates
the
catholics
from
the
protestants
not
most
ostensibly
but
most
vitally
many
are
the
catholics
who
would
accept
luther
idea
of
grace
since
it
is
the
idea
of
saint
augustine
and
of
the
supreme
authority
of
the
scriptures
since
they
were
so
highly
valued
by
the
fathers
but
few
of
the
catholic
clergy
have
ever
tolerated
religious
liberty
that
is
the
interpretation
of
the
scriptures
by
the
people
for
it
is
a
vital
blow
to
their
supremacy
their
hierarchy
and
their
institutions
they
will
no
more
readily
accept
it
than
william
the
conqueror
would
have
accepted
the
magna
charta
for
the
free
circulation
and
free
interpretation
of
the
scriptures
are
the
charter
of
human
liberties
fought
for
at
leipsic
by
gustavus
adolphus
at
ivry
by
henry
iv
this
right
of
worshipping
god
according
to
the
dictates
of
conscience
enlightened
by
the
free
reading
of
the
scriptures
is
just
what
the
invincible
armada
was
sent
by
philip
ii
to
crush
just
what
alva
dictated
by
rome
sought
to
crush
in
holland
just
what
louis
instructed
by
the
jesuits
did
crush
out
in
france
by
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
the
satanic
hatred
of
this
right
was
the
cause
of
most
of
the
martyrdoms
and
persecutions
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
it
was
the
declaration
of
this
right
which
emancipated
europe
from
the
dogmas
of
the
middle
ages
the
thraldom
of
rome
and
the
reign
of
priests
why
should
not
protestants
of
every
shade
cherish
and
defend
this
sacred
right
this
is
what
made
luther
the
idol
and
oracle
of
germany
the
admiration
of
half
europe
the
pride
and
boast
of
succeeding
ages
the
eternal
hatred
of
rome
not
his
religious
experiences
not
his
doctrine
of
justification
by
faith
but
the
emancipation
he
gave
to
the
mind
of
the
world
this
is
what
peculiarly
stamps
luther
as
a
man
of
genius
and
of
that
surprising
audacity
and
boldness
which
only
great
geniuses
evince
when
they
follow
out
the
logical
sequence
of
their
ideas
and
penetrate
at
a
blow
the
hardened
steel
of
vulcanic
armor
beneath
which
the
adversary
boasts
great
was
the
first
leo
when
from
his
rifled
palace
on

of
the
devastated

of

he
looked

the
christian
world
pillaged
sacked

and

in
view
of
the
desolation
predicted
alike
by
jeremy
the
prophet
and
the
cumaean
sybil
great
was
that
leo
when
in
view
of
all
this
he
said
with
old
patrician
heroism
i
will
revive
government
once
more
upon
this
earth
not
by
bringing
back
the
caesars
but
by
declaring
a
new
theocracy
by
making
myself
the
vicegerent
of
christ
by
virtue
of
the
promise
made
to
peter
whose
successor
i
am
in
order
to
restore
law
punish
crime
head
off
heresy
encourage
genius
conserve
peace
heal
dissensions
protect
learning
appealing
to
love
but
ruling
by
fear
who
but
the
church
can
do
this
a
theocracy
will
create
a
new
civilization
not
a
diadem
but
a
tiara
will
i
wear
the
symbol
of
universal
sovereignty
before
which
barbarism
shall
flee
away
and
happiness
be
restored
once
more
as
he
sent
out
his
legates
he
fulminated
his
bulls
and
established
tribunals
of
appeal
he
made
a
of
ecclesiastical
machinery
and
proclaimed
the
dangers
of
eternal
fire
and
brought
kings
and
princes
before
him
on
their
knees
the
barbaric
world
was
saved
but
greater
than
leo
was
luther
when
outraged
by
the
corruptions
of
this
spiritual
despotism
and
all
the
false
and
pagan
notions
which
had
crept
into
theology
obscuring
the
light
of
faith
and
creating
an
intolerable
bondage
and
opposing
the
new
spirit
of
progress
which
science
and
art
and
industry
and
wealth
had
invoked
he
courageously
yet
modestly
comes
forward
as
the
champion
of
a
new
civilization
and
declares
with
trumpet
tones
let
there
be
private
judgment
liberty
of
conscience
the
right
to
read
and
interpret
scripture
in
spite
of
priests
so
that
men
may
think
for
themselves
not
only
on
the
doctrines
of
eternal
salvation
but
on
all
the
questions
to
be
deduced
from
them
or
interlinked
with
the
past
or
present
or
future
institutions
of
the
world
then
shall
arise
a
new
creation
from
dreaded
destruction
and
emancipated
millions
shall
be
filled
with
an
unknown
enthusiasm
and
advance
with
the
new
weapons
of
reason
and
truth
from
conquering
to
conquer
until
all
the
strongholds
of
sin
and
satan
shall
be
subdued
and
laid
triumphantly
at
the
foot
of
his
throne
whose
right
it
is
to
reign
thus
far
luther
has
appeared
as
a
theologian
a
philosopher
a
man
of
ideas
a
man
of
study
and
reflection
whom
the
catholic
church
distrusts
and
fears
as
she
always
has
distrusted
genius
and
manly
independence
but
he
is
henceforth
to
appear
as
a
reformer
a
warrior
to
carry
out
his
idea
and
also
to
defend
himself
against
the
wrath
he
has
provoked
impelled
step
by
step
to
still
bolder
aggressions
until
he
attacks
those
venerable
institutions
which
he
once
respected
all
the
frauds
and
inventions
of
mediaeval
despotism
all
the
machinery
by
which
europe
had
been
governed
for
one
thousand
years
yea
the
very
throne
of
the
pope
himself
whom
he
defies
whom
he
insults
and
against
whom
he
urges
christendom
to
rebel
as
a
combatant
a
warrior
a
reformer
his
person
and
character
somewhat
change
he
is
coarser
he
is
more
he
drinks
more
beer
he
tells
more
stories
he
uses
harder
names
he
becomes
arrogant
dogmatic
he
dictates
and
commands
he
quarrels
with
his
friends
he
is
imperious
he
fears
nobody
and
is
scornful
of
old
usages
he
marries
a
nun
he
feels
that
he
is
a
great
leader
and
general
and
wields
new
powers
he
is
an
executive
and
administrative
man
for
which
his
courage
and
insight
and
will
and
herculean
physical
strength
wonderfully
fit
him
the
man
for
the
times
the
man
to
head
a
new
movement
the
forces
of
an
age
of
protest
and
rebellion
and
conquest
how
can
i
compress
into
a
few
sentences
the
demolitions
and
destructions
which
this
indignant
and
irritated
reformer
now
makes
in
germany
where
he
is
protected
by
the
elector
from
papal
vengeance
before
the
reconstruction
the
old
rubbish
must
be
cleared
away
and
augean
stables
must
be
cleansed
he
is
now
at
issue
with
the
whole
catholic
régime
and
the
whole
catholic
world
abuse
him
they
call
him
a
glutton
a
an
adulterer
a
scoffer
an
atheist
an
imp
of
satan
and
he
calls
the
pope
the
scarlet
mother
of
abominations
antichrist
babylon
that
age
is
prodigal
in
offensive
epithets
kings
and
prelates
and
doctors
alike
use
hard
words
they
are
like
angry
children
and
women
and
pugilists
their
vocabulary
of
abuse
is
amusing
and
inexhaustible
see
how
prodigal
shakspeare
and
ben
jonson
are
in
the
language
of
vituperation
but
they
were
all
defiant
and
fierce
for
the
age
was
rough
and
earnest
the
pope
in
wrath
hurls
the
old
weapons
of
the
gregorys
and
the
clements
but
they
are
impotent
as
the
darts
of
priam
luther
laughs
at
them
and
burns
the
papal
bull
before
a
huge
concourse
of
excited
students
and
shopkeepers
and
enthusiastic
women
he
severs
himself
completely
from
rome
and
declares
an
unextinguishable
warfare
he
destroys
and
breaks
up
the
ceremonies
of
the
mass
he
pulls
down
the
consecrated
altars
with
their
candles
and
smoking
incense
and
vessels
of
silver
and
gold
since
they
are
the
emblems
of
jewish
and
pagan
worship
he
tears
off
the
vestments
of
priests
with
their
embroideries
and
their
gildings
and
their
millineries
and
their
laces
since
these
are
made
to
impose
on
the
imagination
and
appeal
to
the
sense
he
breaks
up
monasteries
and
convents
since
they
are
dens
of
infamy
cages
of
unclean
birds
nurseries
of
idleness
and
pleasure
abodes
at
the
best
of
ascetic
asiatic
recluses
who
rejoice
in
penance
and
and
other
modes
of
propitiating
the
deity
like
soofists
and
fakirs
and
braminical
devotees
in
defiance
of
the
most
sacred
of
the
institutions
of
the
middle
ages
he
openly
marries
catherine
bora
and
sets
up
a
hilarious
household
and
yet
a
household
of
prayer
and
singing
he
abolishes
the
old
gregorian
service
and
for
mediaeval
chants
monotonous
and
gloomy
he
prepares
hymns
and
songs
not
for
boys
and
priests
to
intone
in
the
distant
choir
but
for
the
whole
congregation
to
sing
inspired
by
the
melodies
of
david
and
the
exulting
praises
of
a
saviour
who
redeems
from
darkness
into
light
how
grand
that
hymn
of
his
a
mighty
fortress
is
our
god
a
bulwark
never
failing
he
makes
worship
more
heartfelt
and
revives
apostolic
usages
preaching
and
exhortation
and
instruction
from
the
pulpit
a
forgotten
power
he
appeals
to
reason
rather
than
sense
denounces
superstitions
while
he
rebukes
sins
and
kindles
a
profound
fervor
based
on
the
recognition
of
new
truths
he
is
not
fully
emancipated
from
the
traditions
of
the
past
for
he
retains
the
doctrine
of
transubstantiation
and
keeps
up
the
holidays
of
the
church
and
allows
recreation
on
the
sabbath
but
what
he
thinks
the
most
of
is
the
circulation
of
the
scriptures
among
plain
people
so
he
translates
them
into
german
a
gigantic
task
and
this
work
almost
is
done
so
well
that
it
becomes
the
standard
of
the
german
language
as
the
bible
of
tindale
helped
to
form
the
english
tongue
and
not
only
so
but
it
has
remained
the
common
version
in
use
throughout
germany
even
as
the
authorized
king
james
version
made
nearly
a
century
later
by
the
labor
of
many
scholars
and
divines
has
remained
the
standard
english
bible
moreover
he
finds
time
to
make
liturgies
and
creeds
and
hymns
and
to
write
letters
to
all
parts
of
christendom
a
jerome
a
chrysostom
and
an
augustine
united
a
kind
of
protestant
pope
to
whom
everybody
looks
for
advice
and
consolation
what
a
wonderful
man
no
wonder
the
germans
are
so
fond
of
him
and
so
proud
of
him
a
briareus
with
a
hundred
arms
a
marvel
a
wonder
a
prodigy
of
nature
the
most
gifted
versatile
man
of
his
century
or
nation
at
last
this
great
theologian
this
daring
innovator
is
summoned
by
imperial
not
papal
authority
before
the
diet
of
the
empire
at
worms
where
the
emperor
the
great
charles
presides
amid
bishops
princes
cardinals
legates
generals
and
dignitaries
thither
luther
must
go
yet
under
imperial
safe
conduct
and
consummate
his
protests
and
perhaps
offer
up
his
life
painters
poets
historians
have
made
that
scene
familiar
the
most
memorable
in
the
life
of
luther
as
well
as
one
of
the
grandest
spectacles
of
the
age
i
need
not
dwell
on
that
exciting
scene
where
in
the
presence
of
all
that
was
illustrious
and
powerful
in
germany
this
defenceless
doctor
dares
to
say
to
supremest
temporal
and
spiritual
authority
unless
you
confute
me
by
arguments
drawn
from
scripture
i
can
not
and
will
not
recant
anything
here
i
stand
i
can
not
otherwise
god
help
me
amen
how
superior
to
galileo
and
other
scientific
martyrs
he
is
not
afraid
of
those
who
can
kill
only
the
body
he
is
afraid
only
of
him
who
hath
power
to
cast
both
soul
and
body
into
hell
so
he
stands
as
firm
as
the
eternal
pillars
of
justice
and
his
cause
is
gained
what
if
he
did
not
live
long
to
accomplish
all
he
designed
what
if
he
made
mistakes
and
showed
in
his
career
many
of
the
infirmities
of
human
nature
what
if
he
cared
very
little
for
pictures
and
statues
the
revived
arts
of
greece
and
rome
the
pagan
renaissance
in
which
he
only
sees
infidelity
levities
and
luxuries
and
other
abominations
which
excited
his
disgust
and
abhorrence
when
he
visited
italy
seeks
not
to
amuse
and
adorn
the
papal
empire
but
to
reform
it
as
paul
before
him
sought
to
plant
new
sentiments
and
ideas
in
the
roman
world
indifferent
to
the
arts
of
greece
and
even
the
beauties
of
nature
in
his
absorbing
desire
to
convert
men
to
christ
and
who
since
paul
has
rendered
greater
service
to
humanity
than
luther
the
whole
race
should
be
proud
that
such
a
man
has
lived
we
will
not
follow
the
great
reformer
to
the
decline
of
his
years
we
will
not
dwell
on
his
subsequent
struggles
and
dangers
his
marvellous
preservation
his
personal
habits
his
friendships
and
his
hatreds
his
joys
and
sorrows
his
bitter
alienations
his
vexations
his
disappointments
his
gloomy
anticipations
of
approaching
strife
his
sickened
yet
exultant
soul
his
last
days
of
honor
and
of
victory
his
final
illness
and
his
triumphant
death
in
the
town
where
he
was
born
it
is
his
legacy
that
we
are
concerned
in
the
inheritance
he
left
to
succeeding
generations
the
perpetuated
ideas
of
the
reformation
which
he
worked
out
in
anguish
and
in
study
and
which
we
will
not
let
die
but
will
cherish
in
our
memories
and
our
hearts
as
among
the
most
precious
of
the
heirlooms
of
genius
susceptible
of
boundless
application
and
it
is
destined
to
grow
brighter
and
richer
in
spite
of
and
jesuitism
of
pagan
levities
and
pagan
lies
of
boastful
science
and
epicurean
pleasures
of
material
glories
of

in

centres
around
the
throne
of

so
the
most
prominent
subject
of
historical
interest
in
our
modern
times
is
the
revolt
from
their
almost
unlimited
domination
the
protestant
reformation
in
its
various
relations
was
a
movement
of
transcendent
importance
the
history
of
christendom
in
a
moral
a
political
a
religious
a
literary
and
a
social
point
of
view
for
the
last
three
hundred
years
can
not
be
studied
or
comprehended
without
primary
reference
to
that
memorable
revolution
we
have
seen
how
that
great
insurrection
of
human
intelligence
was
headed
in
germany
by
luther
and
we
shall
shortly
consider
it
in
switzerland
and
france
under
calvin
we
have
now
to
contemplate
the
movement
in
england
the
most
striking
figure
in
it
was
doubtless
thomas
cranmer
archbishop
of
canterbury
although
he
does
not
represent
the
english
reformation
in
all
its
phases
he
was
neither
so
prominent
nor
so
great
a
man
as
luther
or
calvin
or
even
knox
but
taking
him
all
in
all
he
was
the
most
illustrious
of
the
english
reformers
and
he
more
than
any
other
man
gave
direction
to
the
spirit
of
reform
which
had
been
quietly
working
ever
since
the
time
of
wyclif
especially
among
the
humbler
classes
the
english
reformation
the
way
to
which
had
been
long
preparing
began
in
the
reign
of
henry
viii
and
this
unscrupulous
and
tyrannical
monarch
without
being
a
religious
man
gave
the
first
great
impulse
to
an
outbreak
the
remote
consequences
of
which
he
did
not
anticipate
and
with
which
he
had
no
sympathy
he
rebelled
against
the
authority
of
the
pope
without
abjuring
the
roman
catholic
religion
either
as
to
dogmas
or
forms
in
fact
the
first
great
step
towards
reform
was
made
not
by
cranmer
but
by
thomas
cromwell
earl
of
essex
as
the
prime
minister
of
henry
a
man
of
whom
we
really
know
the
least
of
all
the
very
great
statesmen
of
english
history
it
was
he
who
demolished
the
monasteries
and
made
war
on
the
whole
monastic
system
and
undermined
the
papal
power
in
england
and
swept
away
many
of
the
most
glaring
of
those
abuses
which
disgraced
the
papal
empire
armed
with
the
powers
which
wolsey
had
wielded
he
directed
them
into
a
totally
different
channel
so
far
as
the
religious
welfare
of
the
nation
is
considered
although
in
his
principles
of
government
he
was
as
absolute
as
richelieu
like
the
great
french
statesman
he
exalted
the
throne
but
unlike
him
he
promoted
the
personal
reign
of
the
sovereign
he
served
with
remarkable
ability
and
devotion
thomas
cromwell
the
prime
minister
of
henry
after
the
fall
of
wolsey
was
born
in
humble
ranks
and
was
in
early
life
a
common
soldier
in
the
wars
of
italy
then
a
clerk
in
a
mercantile
house
in
antwerp
then
a
wool
merchant
in
middleborough
then
a
member
of
parliament
and
was
employed
by
wolsey
in
suppressing
some
of
the
smaller
monasteries
his
fidelity
to
his
patron
wolsey
at
the
time
of
that
great
fall
attracted
the
special
notice
of
the
king
who
made
him
royal
secretary
in
the
house
of
commons
he
made
his
fortune
by
advising
henry
to
declare
himself
head
of
the
english
church
when
he
was
entangled
in
the
difficulties
growing
out
of
the
divorce
of
catharine
this
advice
was
given
with
the
patriotic
view
of
making
the
royal
authority
superior
to
that
of
the
pope
in
church
patronage
and
of
making
england
independent
of
rome
the
great
scandal
of
the
times
was
the
immoral
lives
of
the
clergy
especially
of
the
monks
and
the
immunities
they
enjoyed
they
were
a
hindrance
to
the
royal
authority
and
weakened
the
resources
of
the
country
by
the
excessive
drain
of
gold
and
silver
sent
to
rome
to
replenish
the
papal
treasury
cromwell
would
make
the
clergy
dependent
on
the
king
and
not
on
the
pope
for
their
investitures
and
promotions
and
he
abominated
the
idle
and
vagabond
lives
of
the
monks
who
had
degenerated
in
england
perhaps
more
than
in
any
other
country
in
europe
in
consequence
of
the
great
wealth
of
their
monasteries
he
was
able
to
render
his
master
and
the
kingdom
a
great
service
from
the
powers
lavished
upon
him
he
presided
at
convocations
as
the
vicegerent
controlled
the
house
of
commons
and
was
of
the
monasteries
he
was
foreign
and
home
secretary
and
president
of
the
or
the
proud
nevilles
the
powerful
percies
and
the
noble
courtenays
all
bowed
before
this
plebeian
son
of
a
mechanic
who
had
arisen
by
force
of
genius
and
lucky
accidents
too
wise
to
build
a
palace
like
hampton
court
but
not
ecclesiastical
enough
in
his
sympathies
to
found
a
college
like
church
as
wolsey
did
he
was
a
man
simple
in
his
tastes
and
like
colbert
the
great
finance
minister
of
france
under
louis
whom
he
resembled
in
his
habits
and
policy
his
great
task
as
well
as
his
great
public
service
was
the
visitation
and
suppression
of
monasteries
he
perceived
that
they
had
fulfilled
their
mission
that
they
were
no
longer
needed
that
they
had
become
corrupt
and
too
corrupt
to
be
reformed
that
they
were
no
longer
abodes
of
piety
or
beehives
of
industry
or
nurseries
of
art
or
retreats
of
learning
that
their
wealth
was
squandered
that
they
upheld
the
arm
of
a
foreign
power
that
they
shielded
offenders
against
the
laws
that
they
encouraged
vagrancy
and
extortion
that
in
short
they
were
nests
of
unclean
birds
the
monks
and
friars
opposed
the
new
learning
now
extending
from
italy
to
france
to
germany
and
to
england
colet
came
back
from
italy
not
to
teach
platonic
mysticism
but
to
unlock
the
scriptures
in
the
original
the
centre
of
a
group
of
scholars
at
oxford
of
whom
erasmus
and
thomas
more
stood
in
the
foremost
rank
before
the
close
of
the
fifteenth
century
it
is
said
that
ten
thousand
editions
of
various
books
had
been
printed
in
different
parts
of
europe
all
the
latin
authors
and
some
of
the
greek
were
accessible
to
students
tunstall
and
latimer
were
sent
to
padua
to
complete
their
studies
fox
bishop
of
winchester
established
a
greek
professorship
at
oxford
it
was
an
age
of
enthusiasm
for
reviving
literature
which
however
received
in
germany
through
the
influence
chiefly
of
luther
a
different
direction
from
what
it
received
in
italy
and
which
extended
from
germany
to
england
but
to
this
awakened
spirit
the
monks
presented
obstacles
and
discouragements
they
had
no
sympathy
with
progress
they
belonged
to
the
dark
ages
they
were
hostile
to
the
circulation
of
the
scriptures
they
were
pedlers
of
indulgences
and
relics
impostors
frauds
vagabonds
gluttons
worldly
sensual
and
avaricious
so
notoriously
corrupt
had
monasteries
become
that
repeated
attempts
had
been
made
to
reform
them
but
without
success
as
early
as
innocent
vii
had
issued
a
commission
for
a
general
investigation
the
monks
were
accused
of
dilapidating
public
property
of
frequenting
infamous
places
of
stealing
jewels
from
consecrated
shrines
in
archbishop
warham
instituted
another
visitation
in
cardinal
wolsey
himself
undertook
the
task
of
reform
at
last
the
parliament
in
appointed
cromwell
vicar
or
issued
a
commission
and
intrusted
it
to
lawyers
not
priests
who
found
that
the
worst
had
not
been
told
it
was
found
that
two
thirds
of
the
monks
of
england
were
living
in
concubinage
that
their
lands
were
wasted
and
mortgaged
and
their
houses
falling
into
ruins
they
found
the
abbot
of
fountains
surrounded
with
more
women
than
mohammed
allowed
his
followers
and
the
nuns
of
litchfield
scandalously
immoral
on
this
report
the
lords
and
commons
deliberately
not
rashly
decreed
the
suppression
of
all
monasteries
the
income
of
which
was
less
than
two
hundred
pounds
a
year
and
the
sequestration
of
their
lands
to
the
king
about
two
hundred
of
the
lesser
convents
were
thus
suppressed
and
the
monks
turned
adrift
yet
not
entirely
without
support
this
spoliation
may
have
been
a
violation
of
the
rights
of
property
but
the
monks
had
betrayed
their
trusts
the
next
parliament
completed
the
work
in
all
the
religious
houses
were
suppressed
both
great
and
small
such
venerable
and
princely
retreats
as
albans
glastonbury
beading
bury
edmunds
and
westminster
which
had
flourished
one
thousand
years
founded
long
before
the
conquest
shared
the
common
ruin
these
probably
would
have
been
spared
had
not
the
first
suppression
filled
the
country
with
traitors
the
great
insurrection
in
lincolnshire
which
shook
the
foundation
of
the
throne
the
intrigues
of
cardinal
pole
the
cornish
conspiracy
in
which
the
great
house
of
neville
was
implicated
and
various
other
agitations
were
all
fomented
by
the
angry
monks
rapacity
was
not
the
leading
motive
of
henry
or
his
minister
but
the
public
welfare
the
measure
of
suppression
and
sequestration
was
violent
but
called
for
cromwell
put
forth
no
such
sophistical
pleas
as
those
revolutionists
who
robbed
the
french
clergy
that
their
property
belonged
to
the
nation
in
france
the
clergy
were
despoiled
not
because
they
were
infamous
but
because
they
were
rich
in
england
the
monks
may
have
suffered
injustice
from
the
severity
of
their
punishment
but
no
one
now
doubts
that
punishment
was
deserved
nor
did
henry
retain
all
the
spoils
himself
he
gave
away
the
abbey
lands
with
a
prodigality
equal
to
his
rapacity
he
gave
them
to
those
who
upheld
his
throne
as
a
reward
for
service
or
loyalty
they
were
given
to
a
new
class
of
statesmen
who
led
the
popular
party
like
the
fitzwilliams
the
russells
the
dudleys
and
the
seymours
and
thus
became
the
foundation
of
their
great
estates
they
were
also
distributed
to
many
merchants
and
manufacturers
who
had
been
loyal
to
the
government
from
to
of
the
landed
property
of
the
kingdom
as
variously
estimated
thus
changed
hands
it
was
an
enormous
confiscation
nearly
as
great
as
that
made
by
william
the
conqueror
in
favor
of
his
army
of
invaders
it
must
have
produced
an
immense
impression
on
the
mind
of
europe
it
was
almost
as
great
a
calamity
to
the
catholic
church
of
england
as
the
emancipation
of
slaves
was
to
their
southern
masters
in
our
late
war
such
a
spoliation
of
the
church
had
not
before
taken
place
in
any
country
of
europe
how
great
an
evil
the
monastic
system
must
have
been
regarded
by
parliament
to
warrant
such
an
act
had
it
not
been
popular
there
would
have
been
discontents
amounting
to
a
general
to
the
throne
it
must
also
be
borne
in
mind
that
this
dissolution
of
the
monasteries
this
attack
on
the
monastic
system
was
not
a
religious
movement
fanned
by
reformers
but
an
act
of
parliament
at
the
instance
of
a
royal
minister
it
was
not
done
under
the
direction
of
a
protestant
king
for
henry
was
never
a
protestant
but
as
a
public
measure
in
behalf
of
morality
and
for
reasons
of
state
it
is
true
that
henry
had
by
his
marriage
with
anne
boleyn
and
the
divorce
of
his
virtuous
queen
defied
the
pope
and
separated
england
from
rome
so
far
as
appointments
to
ecclesiastical
benefices
are
concerned
but
in
offending
the
pope
he
also
equally
offended
charles
the
results
of
his
separation
from
rome
during
his
life
were
purely
political
the
king
did
not
give
up
the
mass
or
the
roman
communion
or
roman
dogmas
of
faith
he
only
prepared
the
way
for
reform
in
the
next
reign
he
only
intensified
the
hatred
between
the
old
conservative
party
and
the
party
of
reform
and
progress
how
far
cromwell
himself
was
a
protestant
it
is
difficult
to
tell
doubtless
he
sympathized
with
the
new
religious
spirit
of
the
age
but
he
did
not
openly
avow
the
faith
of
luther
he
was
the
able
and
unscrupulous
minister
of
an
absolute
monarch
bent
on
sweeping
away
abuses
of
all
kinds
but
with
the
idea
of
enlarging
the
royal
authority
as
much
perhaps
as
promoting
the
prosperity
of
the
realm
he
therefore
turned
his
attention
to
the
ecclesiastical
courts
which
from
the
time
of
becket
had
been
antagonistic
to
royal
encroachments
the
war
between
the
civil
power
and
these
courts
had
begun
before
the
fall
of
wolsey
and
had
resulted
in
the
curtailment
of
probate
duties
legacies
and
mortuaries
by
which
the
clergy
had
been
enriched
a
limitation
of
pluralities
and
enforcement
of
residence
had
also
been
effected
but
a
still
greater
blow
to
the
privileges
of
the
clergy
was
struck
by
the
parliament
under
the
influence
of
cromwell
who
had
elevated
it
in
order
to
give
legality
to
the
despotic
measures
of
the
crown
and
in
this
way
a
law
was
passed
that
no
one
under
the
rank
of
a
if
convicted
of
felony
should
be
allowed
to
plead
his
benefit
of
clergy
but
should
be
punished
like
ordinary
criminals
thus
the
constitutions
of
clarendon
in
the
time
of
becket
another
act
also
was
passed
by
which
no
one
could
be
summoned
as
aforetime
to
the
archbishop
court
out
of
his
own
diocese
a
very
beneficent
act
since
the
people
had
been
needlessly
subject
to
great
expense
and
injustice
in
being
obliged
to
travel
considerable
distances
it
was
moreover
enacted
that
men
could
not
burden
their
estates
beyond
twenty
years
by
providing
priests
to
sing
masses
for
their
souls
the
parliament
likewise
abolished
annats
a
custom
which
had
long
prevailed
in
europe
which
required
one
income
to
be
sent
to
the
pope
on
any
new
preferment
a
great
burden
to
the
clergy
a
sort
of
tribute
to
a
foreign
power
within
fifty
years
one
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
pounds
had
thus
been
sent
from
england
to
rome
from
this
one
source
of
papal
revenue
alone
equal
to
three
million
pounds
at
the
present
time
or
fifteen
millions
of
dollars
from
a
country
of
only
three
millions
of
people
it
was
the
passage
of
that
act
which
induced
sir
thomas
more
a
devoted
catholic
but
a
just
and
able
and
incorruptible
judge
to
resign
the
seals
which
he
had
so
long
and
so
honorably
held
the
most
prominent
man
in
england
after
cromwell
and
cranmer
and
it
was
the
execution
of
this
lofty
character
because
he
held
out
against
the
imperious
demands
of
henry
which
is
the
greatest
stain
upon
this
monarch
reign
parliament
also
called
the
clergy
to
account
for
excessive
acts
of
despotism
and
subjected
them
to
the
penalty
of
a
premunire
the
offence
of
bringing
a
foreign
authority
into
england
from
which
they
were
freed
only
by
enormous
fines
thus
it
would
seem
that
many
abuses
were
removed
by
cromwell
and
the
parliament
during
the
reign
of
henry
viii
which
may
almost
be
considered
as
reforms
of
the
church
itself
the
authority
of
the
church
was
not
attacked
still
less
its
doctrines
but
only
abuses
and
privileges
the
restraint
of
which
was
of
public
benefit
and
which
tended
to
reduce
the
power
of
the
clergy
it
was
this
reduction
of
clerical
usurpations
and
privileges
which
is
the
main
feature
in
the
legislation
of
henry
so
far
as
it
pertained
to
the
church
it
was
wresting
away
the
power
which
the
clergy
had
enjoyed
from
the
days
of
alfred
and
ina
a
reform
which
henry
ii
and
edward
and
other
sovereigns
had
failed
to
effect
this
was
the
great
work
of
cromwell
and
in
it
he
had
the
support
of
his
royal
master
since
it
was
a
transfer
of
power
from
the
clergy
to
the
throne
and
henry
viii
was
hated
and
anathematized
by
rome
as
henry
iv
of
germany
was
without
ceasing
to
be
a
catholic
he
even
retained
the
title
of
defender
of
the
faith
which
had
been
conferred
upon
him
by
the
pope
for
his
opposition
to
the
theological
doctrines
of
luther
which
he
never
accepted
and
which
he
always
detested
cromwell
did
not
long
survive
the
great
services
he
rendered
to
his
king
and
the
nation
in
the
height
of
his
power
he
made
a
fatal
mistake
he
deceived
the
king
in
regard
to
anne
of
cleves
whose
marriage
he
favored
from
motives
of
expediency
and
a
manifest
desire
to
promote
the
protestant
cause
he
palmed
upon
the
king
a
woman
who
could
not
speak
a
word
of
english
a
woman
without
graces
or
accomplishments
who
was
absolutely
hateful
to
him
henry
disappointment
was
bitter
and
his
vengeance
was
unrelenting
the
enemies
of
cromwell
soon
took
advantage
of
this
mistake
the
great
duke
of
norfolk
head
of
the
catholic
party
accused
him
at
the
of
high
treason
two
years
before
such
a
charge
would
have
received
no
attention
but
henry
now
hated
him
and
was
resolved
to
punish
him
for
the
wreck
of
his
domestic
happiness
cromwell
was
hurried
to
that
gloomy
fortress
whose
outlet
was
generally
the
scaffold
he
was
denied
even
the
form
of
trial
a
bill
of
attainder
was
hastily
passed
by
the
parliament
he
had
ruled
only
one
person
in
the
realm
had
the
courage
to
intercede
for
him
and
this
was
cranmer
archbishop
of
canterbury
but
his
entreaties
were
futile
the
fallen
minister
had
no
chance
of
life
and
no
one
knew
it
so
well
as
himself
even
a
trial
would
have
availed
nothing
nothing
could
have
availed
him
he
was
a
doomed
man
so
he
bade
his
foes
make
quick
work
of
it
and
quick
work
was
made
in
eighteen
days
from
his
arrest
thomas
cromwell
earl
of
essex
knight
of
the
garter
grand
chamberlain
lord
privy
seal
and
master
of
the
wards
ascended
the
scaffold
on
which
had
been
shed
the
blood
of
a
queen
making
no
protestation
of
innocence
but
simply
committing
his
soul
to
jesus
christ
in
whom
he
believed
like
wolsey
he
arose
from
an
humble
station
to
the
most
exalted
position
the
king
could
give
and
like
wolsey
he
saw
the
vanity
of
delegated
power
as
soon
as
he
offended
the
source
of
power
he
who
ascends
the
shall
find
the
loftiest
peak
most
wrapped
in
clouds
and
storms
though
high
above
the
sun
of
glory
shines
and
far
beneath
the
earth
and
ocean
spread
round
are
icy
rocks
and
loudly
blow
contending
tempests
on
his
naked
head
on
the
disappearance
of
cromwell
from
the
stage
cranmer
came
forward
more
prominently
he
was
a
learned
doctor
in
that
university
which
has
ever
sent
forth
the
apostles
of
great
emancipating
movements
he
was
born
in
and
was
therefore
twenty
years
of
age
on
the
accession
of
henry
viii
in
and
was
when
luther
published
his
theses
he
early
sympathized
with
the
reform
doctrines
but
was
too
politic
to
take
an
active
part
in
their
discussion
he
was
a
moderate
calm
scholarly
man
not
a
great
genius
or
great
preacher
he
had
none
of
those
bold
and
dazzling
qualities
which
attract
the
gaze
of
the
world
we
behold
in
him
no
fearless
and
impetuous
luther
attacking
with
passionate
earnestness
the
corruptions
of
rome
bracing
himself
up
to
revolutionary
assaults
undaunted
before
kings
and
councils
and
giving
no
rest
to
his
hands
or
slumber
to
his
eyes
until
he
had
consummated
his
protests
a
man
of
the
people
yet
a
dictator
to
princes
we
see
no
severely
logical
calvin
pushing
out
his
metaphysical
deductions
until
he
had
chained
the
intellect
of
his
party
to
a
system
of
incomparable
grandeur
and
yet
of
repulsive
austerity
exacting
all
the
while
the
same
allegiance
to
doctrines
which
he
deduced
from
the
writings
of
paul
as
he
did
to
the
direct
declarations
of
christ
next
to
thomas
aquinas
the
acutest
logician
the
church
has
known
a
like
the
great
dominican
schoolmen
and
their
common
master
and
oracle
saint
augustine
of
hippo
we
see
in
cranmer
no
uncompromising
and
aggressive
reformer
like
knox
controlling
by
a
stern
dogmatism
both
a
turbulent
nobility
and
an
uneducated
people
and
filling
all
classes
alike
with
inextinguishable
hatred
of
everything
that
even
reminded
them
of
rome
nor
do
we
find
in
cranmer
the
outspoken
and
hearty
eloquence
of
latimer
appealing
to
the
people
at
cross
to
shake
off
all
the
trappings
of
the
scarlet
mother
who
had
so
long
bewitched
the
world
with
her
sorceries
cranmer
if
less
eloquent
less
fearless
less
logical
less
able
than
these
was
probably
broader
more
comprehensive
in
his
views
adapting
his
reforms
to
the
circumstances
of
the
age
and
country
and
to
the
genius
of
the
english
mind
hence
his
reforms
if
less
brilliant
were
more
permanent
he
framed
the
creed
that
finally
was
known
as
the
articles
and
was
the
true
founder
of
the
english
church
as
that
church
has
existed
for
more
than
three
centuries
neither
roman
nor
puritan
but
between
rome
and
geneva
a
compromise
and
yet
a
church
of
great
vitality
and
endeared
to
the
hearts
of
the
english
people
northern
germany
the
scene
of
the
stupendous
triumphs
of
luther
is
and
has
been
since
the
time
of
frederick
the
great
the
of
rationalistic
inquiries
and
the
genevan
as
well
as
the
french
and
swiss
churches
which
calvin
controlled
have
become
cold
with
a
dreary
and
formal
protestantism
without
poetry
or
life
but
the
church
of
england
has
survived
two
revolutions
and
all
the
changes
of
human
thought
and
is
still
a
mighty
power
decorous
beautiful
conservative
yet
open
to
all
the
liberalizing
influences
of
an
age
of
science
and
philosophy
cranmer
though
a
scholastic
seems
to
have
perceived
that
nothing
is
more
misleading
and
uncertain
and
unsatisfactory
than
any
truth
pushed
out
to
its
severest
logical
conclusions
without
reference
to
other
truths
which
have
for
their
support
the
same
divine
authority
it
is
not
logic
which
has
built
up
the
most
enduring
institutions
but
and
plain
truths
and
appeals
to
human
consciousness
the
ergo
without
whose
approval
most
systems
have
perished
mediis
tutissimus
is
not
indeed
an
agreeable
maxim
to
zealots
and
partisans
and
dialectical
logicians
but
it
seems
to
be
induced
from
the
varied
experiences
of
human
life
and
the
history
of
different
ages
and
nations
and
applies
to
all
the
mixed
sciences
like
government
and
political
economy
as
well
as
to
church
institutions
as
cromwell
made
his
fortune
by
advising
the
king
to
assume
the
headship
of
the
church
in
england
so
cranmer
rise
is
to
be
traced
to
his
advice
to
henry
to
appeal
to
the
decision
of
universities
whether
or
not
he
could
be
legally
divorced
from
catharine
since
the
pope
true
to
the
traditions
of
the
catholic
church
or
from
fear
of
charles
would
not
grant
a
dispensation
all
this
business
was
a
miserable
quibble
a
tissue
of
scholastic
technicalities
but
it
answered
the
ends
of
cranmer
the
schools
decided
for
the
king
and
a
great
injustice
and
heartless
cruelty
was
done
to
a
worthy
and
loyal
woman
and
a
great
insult
offered
to
the
church
and
to
the
emperor
charles
of
germany
who
was
a
nephew
of
the
spanish
princess
and
english
queen
this
scandal
resulted
in
a
separation
from
rome
as
was
foreseen
both
by
cromwell
and
cranmer
and
the
latter
became
archbishop
of
canterbury
a
prelate
whose
power
and
dignity
were
greater
then
than
at
the
present
day
exalted
as
the
post
is
even
now
the
highest
in
dignity
and
rank
to
which
a
subject
can
aspire
higher
even
than
the
lord
high
chancellorship
both
of
which
however
pale
before
the
position
of
a
prime
minister
so
far
as
power
is
concerned
the
separation
from
rome
the
suppression
of
the
monasteries
and
the
curtailment
of
the
powers
of
the
spiritual
courts
were
the
only
reforms
of
note
during
the
reign
of
henry
unless
we
name
also
the
new
translation
of
the
bible
authorized
through
cranmer
influence
and
the
teaching
of
the
creed
the
commandments
and
the
lord
prayer
in
english
the
king
died
in
cranmer
was
now
and
was
left
to
prosecute
reforms
in
his
own
way
as
president
of
the
council
of
regency
edward
vi
being
but
nine
years
old
a
learned
boy
as
macaulay
calls
him
but
still
a
boy
in
the
hands
of
the
great
noblemen
who
composed
the
regency
and
who
belonged
to
the
progressive
school
i
do
not
think
the
career
of
cranmer
during
the
life
of
henry
is
sufficiently
appreciated
he
must
have
shown
at
least
extraordinary
tact
and
wisdom
with
his
reforming
tendencies
and
enlightened
views
not
to
come
in
conflict
with
his
sovereign
as
becket
did
with
henry
ii
he
had
to
deal
with
the
most
capricious
and
jealous
of
tyrants
cruel
and
unscrupulous
when
crossed
a
man
who
rarely
retained
a
friendship
or
remembered
a
service
who
never
forgave
an
injury
or
forgot
an
affront
a
glutton
and
a
sensualist
although
prodigal
with
his
gifts
social
in
his
temper
enlightened
in
his
government
and
with
very
respectable
abilities
and
very
considerable
theological
knowledge
this
hard
and
exacting
master
cranmer
had
to
serve
without
exciting
his
suspicions
or
coming
in
conflict
with
him
so
that
he
seemed
politic
and
vacillating
for
which
he
would
not
be
excused
were
it
not
for
his
subsequent
services
and
his
undoubted
sincerity
and
devotion
to
the
protestant
cause
during
the
life
of
henry
we
can
scarcely
call
cranmer
a
reformer
the
most
noted
reformer
of
the
day
was
old
hugh
latimer
the
chaplain
who
declaimed
against
sin
with
the
zeal
and
fire
of
savonarola
and
aimed
to
create
a
religious
life
among
the
people
from
whom
he
sprung
and
whom
he
loved
a
rough
hearty
honest
conscientious
man
with
deep
convictions
and
lofty
soul
in
the
reforms
thus
far
carried
on
we
perceive
that
though
popular
they
emanated
from
princes
and
not
from
the
people
the
people
had
no
hand
in
the
changes
made
as
at
geneva
only
the
ministers
of
kings
and
great
public
functionaries
and
in
the
reforms
subsequently
effected
which
really
constitute
the
english
reformation
they
were
made
by
the
council
of
regency
under
the
leadership
of
cranmer
and
the
protectorship
of
somerset
the
first
thing
which
the
government
did
after
the
accession
of
edward
vi
was
to
remove
images
from
the
churches
as
a
form
of
idolatry
much
to
the
wrath
of
gardiner
bishop
of
winchester
the
ablest
man
of
the
old
conservative
and
papal
party
but
ridley
afterwards
bishop
of
rochester
preached
against
all
forms
of
papal
superstition
with
so
much
ability
and
zeal
that
the
churches
were
soon
cleared
of
these
helps
to
devotion
cranmer
now
unchecked
turned
his
attention
to
other
reforms
but
proceeded
slowly
and
cautiously
not
wishing
to
hazard
much
at
the
outset
first
communion
of
both
kinds
heretofore
restricted
to
the
clergy
was
appointed
and
closely
connected
with
it
masses
were
put
down
then
a
law
was
passed
by
parliament
that
the
appointment
of
bishops
should
vest
in
the
crown
alone
and
not
as
formerly
be
confirmed
by
the
pope
the
next
great
thing
to
which
the
reformers
directed
their
attention
was
the
preparation
of
a
new
liturgy
in
the
public
worship
of
god
which
gave
rise
to
considerable
discussion
they
did
not
seek
to
sweep
away
the
old
form
for
it
was
prepared
by
the
sainted
doctors
of
the
church
of
all
ages
but
they
would
purge
it
of
all
superstitions
and
retain
what
was
most
beautiful
and
expressive
in
the
old
prayers
the
ten
commandments
the
lord
prayer
and
the
early
creeds
of
course
were
retained
as
well
as
whatever
was
in
harmony
with
primitive
usages
these
changes
called
out
letters
from
calvin
at
geneva
who
was
now
recognized
as
a
great
oracle
among
the
protestants
he
encouraged
the
work
but
advised
a
more
complete
reformation
and
complained
of
the
coldness
of
the
clergy
as
well
as
of
the
general
vices
of
the
times
martin
bucer
of
strasburg
at
this
time
professor
at
cambridge
also
wrote
letters
to
the
same
effect
but
the
time
had
not
come
for
more
radical
reforms
then
parliament
controlled
by
the
government
passed
an
act
allowing
the
clergy
to
marry
opposed
of
course
by
many
bishops
in
allegiance
to
rome
this
was
a
great
step
in
reform
and
removed
many
popular
scandals
it
struck
a
heavy
blow
at
the
superstitions
of
the
middle
ages
and
showed
that
celibacy
sprung
from
no
law
of
god
but
was
oriental
in
its
origin
encouraged
by
the
popes
to
cement
their
throne
and
this
act
concerning
the
marriage
of
the
clergy
was
soon
followed
by
the
celebrated
articles
framed
by
cranmer
and
ridley
which
are
the
bases
of
the
english
church
a
theological
creed
slightly
amended
afterwards
in
the
reign
of
elizabeth
evangelical
but
not
calvinistic
affirming
the
great
ideas
of
augustine
and
luther
as
to
grace
justification
by
faith
and
original
sin
and
repudiating
purgatory
pardons
the
worship
and
invocation
of
saints
and
images
a
larger
creed
than
the
nicene
or
athanasian
and
comprehensive
such
as
most
protestants
might
accept
both
this
and
the
book
of
common
prayer
were
written
with
consummate
taste
were
the
work
of
great
scholars
moderate
broad
enlightened
conciliatory
the
reformers
then
gave
their
attention
to
an
alteration
of
ecclesiastical
laws
in
reference
to
matters
which
had
always
been
decided
in
ecclesiastical
courts
the
commissioners
the
ablest
men
in
england
in
number
had
scarcely
completed
their
work
before
the
young
king
died
and
mary
ascended
the
throne
we
can
not
too
highly
praise
the
moderation
with
which
the
reforms
had
been
made
especially
when
we
remember
the
violence
of
the
age
there
were
only
two
or
three
capital
executions
for
heresy
gardiner
and
bonner
who
opposed
the
reformation
with
unparalleled
bitterness
were
only
deprived
of
their
sees
and
sent
to
the
tower
the
execution
of
somerset
was
the
work
of
politicians
of
great
noblemen
jealous
of
his
ascendency
it
does
not
belong
to
the
reformation
nor
do
the
executions
of
a
few
other
noblemen
cranmer
himself
was
a
statesman
rather
than
a
preacher
he
left
but
few
sermons
and
these
commonplace
without
learning
or
wit
or
zeal
ordinary
exhortations
to
a
virtuous
life
the
chief
thing
outside
of
the
reforms
i
have
mentioned
was
the
publication
of
a
few
homilies
for
the
use
of
the
clergy
too
ignorant
to
write
sermons
which
homilies
were
practical
and
orthodox
but
containing
nothing
to
stir
up
an
ardent
religious
life
the
bible
was
also
given
a
greater
scope
everybody
could
read
it
if
he
wished
public
prayer
was
restored
to
the
people
in
a
language
which
they
could
understand
and
a
few
preachers
arose
who
appealed
to
conscience
and
reason
like
latimer
and
ridley
and
hooper
and
taylor
but
most
of
them
were
formal
and
cold
there
must
have
been
great
religious
apathy
or
else
these
reforms
would
have
excited
more
opposition
on
the
part
of
the
clergy
who
generally
acquiesced
in
the
changes
but
the
reformation
thus
far
was
official
it
was
not
popular
it
repressed
vice
and
superstition
but
kindled
no
great
enthusiasm
it
was
necessary
for
the
english
reformers
and
sincere
protestants
to
go
through
a
great
trial
to
be
persecuted
to
submit
to
martyrdom
for
the
sake
of
their
opinions
the
school
of
heroes
and
saints
has
ever
been
among
blazing
fires
and
scaffolds
it
was
martyrdom
which
first
gave
form
and
power
to
early
christianity
the
first
chapter
in
the
history
of
the
early
church
is
the
torments
of
the
martyrs
the
english
reformation
had
no
great
dignity
or
life
until
the
funeral
pyres
were
lighted
men
had
placidly
accepted
new
opinions
and
had
bibles
to
instruct
them
but
it
was
to
be
seen
how
far
they
would
make
sacrifices
to
maintain
them
this
test
was
afforded
by
the
accession
of
mary
daughter
of
catharine
the
spaniard
an
affectionate
and
woman
enough
in
ordinary
times
but
a
fiend
of
bigotry
like
catherine
de
medicis
when
called
upon
to
suppress
the
reformation
although
on
her
accession
she
declared
that
she
would
force
no
man
conscience
but
the
first
thing
she
does
is
to
restore
the
popish
bishops
for
so
they
were
called
then
by
historians
and
the
next
thing
she
does
is
to
restore
the
mass
and
the
third
to
shut
up
cranmer
and
latimer
in
the
tower
attaint
and
execute
them
with
sundry
others
like
ridley
and
hooper
as
well
as
those
great
nobles
who
favored
the
claims
of
the
lady
jane
grey
and
the
religious
reforms
of
edward
vi
she
reconciles
herself
with
rome
and
accepts
its
legate
at
her
court
she
receives
spanish
spies
and
jesuit
confessors
she
marries
the
son
of
charles
afterwards
philip
ii
she
executes
the
lady
jane
grey
she
keeps
the
strictest
watch
on
the
princess
elizabeth
who
learns
in
her
retirement
the
art
of
dissimulation
and
lying
she
forms
an
alliance
with
spain
she
makes
cardinal
pole
archbishop
of
canterbury
she
gives
almost
unlimited
power
to
gardiner
and
bonner
who
begin
a
series
of
diabolical
persecutions
burning
such
people
as
john
rogers
sanders
doctor
taylor
of
hadley
william
hunter
and
stephen
harwood
ferreting
out
all
suspected
of
heresy
and
confining
them
in
the
foulest
jails
burning
even
little
children
mary
even
takes
measures
to
introduce
the
inquisition
and
restore
the
monasteries
everywhere
are
scaffolds
and
burnings
in
three
years
nearly
three
hundred
people
were
burned
alive
often
with
green
wood
a
small
number
compared
with
those
who
were
executed
and
assassinated
in
france
about
this
time
by
catherine
de
medicis
the
guises
and
charles
ix
in
those
dreadful
persecutions
which
began
with
the
accession
of
mary
it
was
impossible
that
cranmer
should
escape
in
spite
of
his
dignity
rank
age
and
services
he
could
hope
for
no
favor
or
indulgence
from
that
morose
woman
in
whose
sapless
bosom
no
compassion
for
the
protestants
ever
found
admission
and
still
less
from
those
cruel
mercenary
bigoted
prelates
whom
she
selected
for
her
ministers
it
was
not
customary
in
that
age
for
the
roman
church
to
spare
heretics
whether
high
or
low
would
it
forgive
him
who
had
overturned
the
consecrated
altars
displaced
the
ritual
of
a
thousand
years
and
revolted
from
the
authority
of
the
supreme
head
of
the
christian
world
would
mary
suffer
him
to
pass
unpunished
who
had
displaced
her
mother
from
the
nuptial
bed
and
pronounced
her
own
birth
to
be
stained
with
an
ignominious
blot
and
who
had
exalted
a
rival
to
the
throne
and
gardiner
and
bonner
too
those
bigoted
prelates
and
ministers
who
would
have
sent
to
the
flames
an
unoffending
woman
if
she
denied
the
authority
of
the
pope
were
not
the
men
to
suffer
him
to
escape
who
had
not
only
overturned
the
papal
power
in
england
but
had
deprived
them
of
their
sees
and
sent
them
to
the
tower
no
matter
how
decent
the
forms
of
law
or
respectful
the
agents
of
the
crown
cranmer
had
not
the
shadow
of
a
hope
and
hence
he
was
certainly
weak
to
say
the
least
to
trust
to
any
deceitful
promises
made
to
him
what
his
enemies
were
bent
upon
was
his
recantation
as
preliminary
to
his
execution
and
he
should
have
been
firm
both
for
his
cause
and
because
his
martyrdom
was
sure
in
an
evil
hour
he
listened
to
the
voice
of
the
seducer
both
life
and
dignities
were
promised
if
he
would
recant
confounded
old
the
love
of
life
and
the
fear
of
death
were
stronger
for
a
time
than
the
power
of
conscience
or
dignity
of
character
six
several
times
was
he
induced
to
recant
the
doctrines
he
had
preached
and
profess
an
allegiance
which
could
only
be
a
solemn
mockery
true
cranmer
came
to
himself
he
perceived
that
he
was
mocked
and
felt
both
grief
and
shame
in
view
of
his
apostasy
his
last
hours
were
glorious
never
did
a
good
man
more
splendidly
redeem
his
memory
from
shame
being
permitted
to
address
the
people
before
his
execution
with
the
hope
on
the
part
of
his
tormentors
that
he
would
publicly
confirm
his
recantation
he
first
supplicated
the
mercy
and
forgiveness
of
almighty
god
and
concluded
his
speech
with
these
memorable
words
and
now
i
come
to
the
great
thing
that
troubleth
my
conscience
more
than
anything
i
ever
did
or
said
even
the
setting
forth
of
writings
contrary
to
the
truth
which
i
now
renounce
and
refuse
those
things
written
with
my
own
hand
contrary
to
the
truth
i
thought
in
my
heart
and
writ
for
fear
of
death
and
to
save
my
life
and
forasmuch
as
my
hand
offended
in
writing
contrary
to
my
heart
therefore
my
hand
shall
first
be
punished
for
if
i
come
to
the
fire
it
shall
first
be
burned
as
for
the
pope
i
denounce
him
as
christ
enemy
and
antichrist
with
all
his
false
doctrines
then
he
was
carried
away
and
a
great
multitude
ran
after
him
exhorting
him
while
time
was
to
remember
himself
coming
to
the
stake
says
the
catholic
with
a
cheerful
countenance
and
willing
mind
he
took
off
his
garments
in
haste
and
stood
upright
in
his
shirt
fire
being
applied
he
stretched
forth
his
right
hand
and
thrust
it
into
the
flame
before
the
fire
came
to
any
other
part
of
his
body
when
his
hand
was
to
be
seen
sensibly
burning
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice
hand
hath
offended
thus
died
cranmer
in
the
year
of
his
age
after
presiding
over
the
church
of
england
above
twenty
years
and
having
bequeathed
a
legacy
to
his
countrymen
of
which
they
continue
to
be
proud
he
had
not
the
intrepidity
of
latimer
he
was
supple
to
henry
viii
he
was
weak
in
his
recantation
he
was
not
an
original
genius
but
he
was
a
man
of
great
breadth
of
views
conciliating
wise
temperate
in
reform
and
discharged
his
great
trust
with
conscientious
adherence
to
the
truth
as
he
understood
it
the
friend
of
calvin
and
revered
by
the
protestant
world
queen
mary
reigned
fortunately
but
five
years
and
the
persecutions
she
encouraged
and
indorsed
proved
the
seed
of
a
higher
morality
and
a
loftier
religious
life
for
thus
spake
aged
latimer
i
tarry
by
the
stake
not
trusting
in
my
own
weak
heart
but
for
the
saviour
sake
why
speak
of
life
or
death
to
me
whose
days
are
but
a

never

the
brand
the
triumphs
of

in
government
and
doctrine
popular
enthusiasm
was
kindled
never
afterwards
to
be
repressed
the
great
ideas
of
the
reformation
began
now
to
agitate
the
mind
of
england
not
so
much
the
logical
doctrines
of
calvin
as
the
emancipating
ideas
of
luther
the
renaissance
had
begun
and
the
two
movements
were
incorporated
the
religious
one
of
germany
and
the
pagan
one
of
italy
both
favoring
liberality
of
mind
a
freer
style
of
literature
restless
inquiries
enterprise
the
revival
of
learning
and
art
an
intense
spirit
of
progress
and
disgust
for
the
dark
ages
and
all
the
dogmas
of
scholasticism
with
this
spirit
of
progress
and
moderate
protestantism
elizabeth
herself
the
best
educated
woman
in
england
warmly
sympathized
as
did
also
the
illustrious
men
she
drew
to
her
court
to
whom
she
gave
the
great
offices
of
state
i
can
not
call
her
age
a
religious
one
it
was
a
merry
one
cheerful
inquiring
untrammelled
in
thought
bold
in
speculation
eloquent
honest
fervid
courageous
hostile
to
the
papacy
and
all
the
bigots
of
europe
it
was
still
rough
coarse
sensual
when
money
was
scarce
and
industries
in
their
infancy
and
material
civilization
not
very
attractive
but
it
was
a
great
age
glorious
intellectual
brilliant
with
such
statesmen
as
burleigh
and
walsingham
to
head
off
treason
and
conspiracy
when
great
poets
arose
like
jonson
and
spenser
and
shakspeare
and
philosophers
like
bacon
and
sir
thomas
browne
and
lawyers
like
nicholas
bacon
and
coke
and
elegant
courtiers
like
sidney
and
raleigh
and
essex
men
of
wit
men
of
enterprise
who
would
explore
distant
seas
and
colonize
new
countries
yea
great
preachers
like
jeremy
taylor
and
hall
and
great
theologians
like
hooker
and
chillingworth
giving
polish
and
dignity
to
an
uncouth
language
and
planting
religious
truth
in
the
minds
of
men
elizabeth
with
such
a
constellation
around
her
had
no
great
difficulty
in
protestantism
and
giving
it
a
new
impetus
although
she
adhered
to
liturgies
and
pomps
and
loved
processions
and
fêtes
and
banquets
and
balls
and
expensive
dresses
a
worldly
woman
but
progressive
and
enlightened
in
the
religious
reforms
of
that
age
you
see
the
work
of
princes
and
statesmen
still
rather
than
any
great
insurrection
of
human
intelligence
or
any
great
religious
revival
although
the
germs
of
it
were
springing
up
through
the
popular
preachers
and
the
influence
of
genevan
reformers
calvin
writings
were
potent
and
john
knox
was
on
his
way
to
scotland
i
pass
by
rapidly
the
reforms
of
elizabeth
reign
effected
by
the
queen
and
her
ministers
and
the
convocation
of
protestant
bishops
and
clergy
and
learned
men
in
the
universities
oxford
and
cambridge
were
then
in
their
glory
crowded
with
poor
students
from
all
parts
of
england
who
came
to
study
greek
and
latin
and
read
theology
not
to
ride
horses
and
row
boats
to
put
on
dandified
airs
and
sneer
at
lectures
running
away
to
london
to
attend
theatres
and
flirt
with
girls
and
drink
champagne
beggaring
their
fathers
and
ruining
their
own
expectations
and
their
health
in
a
very
short
time
after
the
accession
of
elizabeth
which
was
hailed
generally
as
a
very
auspicious
event
things
were
restored
to
nearly
the
state
in
which
they
were
left
by
cranmer
in
the
preceding
reign
this
was
not
done
by
direct
authority
of
the
queen
but
by
acts
of
parliament
even
henry
viii
ruled
through
the
parliament
only
it
was
his
tool
and
instrument
elizabeth
consulted
its
wishes
as
the
representation
of
the
nation
for
she
aimed
to
rule
by
the
affections
of
her
people
but
she
recommended
the
parliament
to
conciliatory
measures
to
avoid
extremes
to
drop
offensive
epithets
like
papist
and
heretic
to
go
as
far
as
the
wants
of
the
nation
required
and
no
farther
though
a
zealous
protestant
she
seemed
to
have
no
great
animosities
her
particular
aversion
was
bonner
the
violent
bishop
of
london
who
was
deprived
of
his
see
and
shut
up
in
the
tower
put
out
of
harm
way
not
cruelly
treated
he
was
not
even
deprived
of
his
good
dinners
she
appointed
as
her
prerogative
allowed
a
very
gentle
moderate
broad
man
to
be
archbishop
of
canterbury
parker
who
had
been
chaplain
to
her
mother
and
who
was
highly
esteemed
by
burleigh
and
nicholas
bacon
her
most
influential
ministers
parliament
confirmed
the
old
act
passed
during
the
reign
of
henry
making
the
sovereign
the
head
of
the
english
church
although
the
title
of
supreme
head
was
left
out
in
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
conciliate
the
catholic
party
to
execute
this
supremacy
the
court
of
high
commission
was
established
afterwards
so
abused
by
charles
i
the
church
service
was
modified
and
the
act
of
uniformity
was
passed
by
parliament
after
considerable
debate
the
changes
were
all
made
in
the
spirit
of
moderation
and
few
suffered
beyond
a
deprivation
of
their
sees
or
livings
for
refusing
to
take
the
oath
of
supremacy
then
followed
the
articles
setting
forth
the
creed
of
the
established
church
substantially
the
creed
which
cranmer
had
made
and
a
new
translation
of
the
bible
and
the
regulation
of
ecclesiastical
courts
but
whatever
was
done
was
in
good
taste
marked
by
good
sense
and
moderation
to
preserve
decency
and
decorum
and
repress
all
extremes
of
superstition
and
license
the
clergy
preached
in
a
black
gown
and
genevan
bands
using
the
surplice
only
in
the
liturgy
we
see
no
lace
or
millinery
the
churches
were
stripped
of
images
the
pulpits
became
high
and
prominent
the
altars
were
changed
to
without
candles
and
symbols
there
was
not
much
account
made
of
singing
for
the
lyric
version
of
the
psalms
was
execrable
for
the
first
time
since
chrysostom
and
gregory
nazianzen
preaching
became
the
chief
duty
of
the
clergyman
and
his
sermons
were
long
for
the
people
were
greedy
of
instruction
and
were
not
critical
of
artistic
merits
among
other
things
of
note
the
exiles
were
recalled
who
brought
back
with
them
the
learning
of
the
continent
and
the
theology
of
geneva
and
an
intense
hatred
for
all
the
old
forms
of
superstition
images
crucifixes
lighted
candles
catholic
vestments
and
a
supreme
regard
for
the
authority
of
the
scriptures
rather
than
the
authority
of
the
church
these
men
mostly
learned
and
pious
were
not
contented
with
the
restoration
as
effected
by
elizabeth
reformers
they
wanted
greater
simplicity
of
worship
and
a
more
definite
and
logical
creed
and
they
made
a
good
deal
of
trouble
being
very
conscientious
and
somewhat
narrow
and
intolerant
so
that
after
the
of
protestantism
the
religious
history
of
the
reign
is
chiefly
concerned
with
the
quarrels
and
animosities
within
the
church
particularly
about
vestments
and
modes
of
worship
things
unessential
minute
technical
which
led
to
great
acerbity
on
both
sides
and
to
some
persecution
for
these
quarrels
provoked
the
queen
and
her
ministers
who
wanted
peace
and
uniformity
to
the
government
it
seemed
strange
and
absurd
for
these
returned
exiles
to
make
such
a
fuss
about
a
few
externals
to
these
intensified
protestants
it
seemed
harsh
and
cruel
that
government
should
insist
on
such
a
rigid
uniformity
and
punish
them
for
not
doing
as
they
were
bidden
by
the
bishops
so
they
separated
from
the
established
church
and
became
what
were
called
nonconformists
having
not
only
disgust
of
the
decent
ritualism
of
the
church
but
great
wrath
for
the
bishops
and
hierarchy
and
spiritual
courts
they
also
disapproved
of
the
holy
days
which
the
church
retained
and
the
prayers
and
the
cathedral
style
of
worship
the
use
of
the
cross
in
baptism
godfathers
and
godmothers
the
confirmation
of
children
kneeling
at
the
sacrament
bowing
at
the
name
of
jesus
the
ring
in
marriage
the
surplice
the
divine
right
of
bishops
and
some
other
things
which
reminded
them
of
rome
for
which
they
had
absolute
detestation
seeing
in
the
old
catholic
church
nothing
but
abominations
and
usurpations
no
religion
at
all
only
superstition
and
government
and
doctrine
the
reign
of
the
beast
the
mystic
babylon
the
scarlet
mother
revelling
in
the
sorceries
of
ancient
paganism
these
terrible
animosities
against
even
the
shadows
and
resemblances
of
what
was
called
popery
were
increased
and
intensified
by
the
persecution
and
massacres
which
the
catholics
about
this
time
were
committing
on
the
protestants
in
france
and
germany
and
the
low
countries
and
which
filled
the
people
of
england
especially
the
middle
and
lower
classes
with
fear
alarm
anger
and
detestation
i
will
not
enter
upon
the
dissensions
which
so
early
crept
into
the
english
church
and
led
to
a
separation
or
a
schism
whatever
name
it
goes
by
to
most
people
in
these
times
not
very
interesting
or
edifying
because
they
were
not
based
on
any
great
ideas
of
universal
application
and
seeming
to
such
minds
as
bacon
and
parker
and
jewell
rather
narrow
and
frivolous
the
great
puritan
controversy
would
have
no
dignity
if
it
were
confined
to
vestments
and
robes
and
forms
of
worship
and
hatred
of
ceremonies
and
holy
days
and
other
matters
which
seemed
to
lean
to
romanism
but
the
grandeur
and
the
permanence
of
the
movement
were
in
a
return
to
the
faith
of
the
primitive
church
and
a
purer
national
morality
and
to
the
unrestricted
study
of
the
bible
and
the
exaltation
of
preaching
and
christian
instruction
over
forms
and
liturgies
and
antiphonal
chants
above
all
the
exaltation
of
reason
and
learning
in
the
interpretation
of
revealed
truth
and
the
education
of
the
people
in
all
matters
which
concern
their
temporal
or
religious
interests
so
that
a
true
and
rapid
progress
was
inaugurated
in
civilization
itself
which
has
peculiarly
marked
all
protestant
countries
having
religious
liberty
underneath
all
these
apparently
insignificant
squabbles
and
dissensions
there
were
two
things
of
immense
historical
importance
first
a
spirit
of
intolerance
on
the
part
of
government
and
of
church
dignitaries
the
state
allied
with
the
church
forcing
uniformity
with
their
decrees
and
severely
punishing
those
who
did
not
accept
them
in
matters
beyond
all
worldly
authority
and
secondly
a
rising
spirit
of
religious
liberty
determined
to
assert
its
glorious
rights
at
any
cost
or
hazard
and
especially
defended
by
the
most
religious
and
earnest
part
of
the
clergy
who
were
becoming
calvinistic
in
their
creed
and
were
pushing
the
ideas
of
the
reformation
to
their
utmost
logical
sequence
this
spirit
was
suppressed
during
the
reign
of
elizabeth
out
of
general
respect
and
love
for
her
as
a
queen
and
the
external
dangers
to
which
the
realm
was
exposed
from
spain
and
france
which
diverted
the
national
mind
but
it
burst
out
fiercely
in
the
next
reigns
under
james
and
charles
about
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
this
is
the
last
development
of
the
reformation
in
england
to
which
i
can
allude
the
great
puritan
contest
for
liberty
of
worship
running
when
opposed
unjustly
and
cruelly
into
a
contest
for
civil
liberty
that
is
the
right
to
change
forms
and
institutions
of
civil
government
even
to
the
dethronement
of
kings
when
it
was
the
expressed
and
declared
will
of
the
people
in
whom
was
vested
the
ultimate
source
of
sovereignty
but
here
i
must
be
brief
i
tread
on
familiar
ground
made
familiar
by
all
our
literature
especially
by
the
most
brilliant
writer
of
modern
times
though
not
the
greatest
philosopher
i
mean
that
great
artist
and
macaulay
whose
chief
excellence
is
in
making
clear
and
interesting
and
vivid
by
a
world
of
illustration
and
practical
and
marvellous
erudition
what
was
obvious
to
his
own
objective
mind
and
obvious
also
to
most
other
enlightened
people
not
much
interested
in
metaphysical
disquisitions
no
man
more
than
he
does
justice
to
the
love
of
liberty
which
absolutely
burned
in
the
souls
of
the
puritans
that
glorious
party
which
produced
milton
and
cromwell
and
hampden
and
bunyan
and
owen
and
calamy
and
baxter
and
howe
the
chief
peculiarity
of
those
puritans
once
called
nonconformists
afterwards
presbyterians
and
independents
was
their
reception
of
the
creed
of
john
calvin
the
clearest
and
most
logical
intellect
that
the
reformation
produced
though
not
the
broadest
who
reigned
as
a
religious
dictator
at
geneva
and
in
the
reformed
churches
of
france
and
who
gave
to
john
knox
the
positivism
and
sternness
and
rigidity
which
he
succeeded
in
impressing
upon
the
churches
of
scotland
and
the
peculiar
doctrines
which
marked
calvin
and
his
disciples
were
those
deduced
from
the
majesty
of
god
and
the
comparative
littleness
of
man
leading
to
and
bound
up
with
the
impotence
of
the
will
human
dependence
the
necessity
of
divine
grace
augustinian
in
spirit
but
going
beyond
augustine
in
the
subtlety
of
metaphysical
distinctions
and
dissertations
on
election
and
predestination
unfathomable
but
exceedingly
attractive
subjects
to
the
divines
of
the
seventeenth
century
creating
a
metaphysical
divinity
a
theology
of
the
brain
rather
than
of
the
heart
a
brilliant
series
of
logical
and
metaphysical
deductions
from
established
truths
demanding
to
be
received
with
the
same
unhesitating
obedience
as
the
truths
or
bible
declarations
from
which
they
are
deduced
the
greatness
of
human
reason
was
never
more
forcibly
shown
than
in
these
deductions
but
they
were
carried
so
far
as
to
insult
reason
itself
and
mock
the
consciousness
of
mankind
so
that
mankind
rebelled
against
the
very
force
of
the
highest
reasonings
of
the
human
intellect
because
they
pushed
logical
sequence
into
absurdity
or
to
dreadful
conclusions
quidem
horribile
said
the
great
master
himself
the
puritans
were
trained
in
this
theology
which
developed
the
loftiest
virtues
and
the
severest
making
them
both
heroes
and
visionaries
always
conscientious
and
sometimes
repulsive
fitting
them
for
gigantic
tasks
and
unworthy
squabbles
driving
them
to
the
bible
and
then
to
acrimonious
discussions
creating
fears
almost
mediaeval
leading
them
to
technical
observation
of
religious
duties
and
transforming
the
most
genial
and
affectionate
people
under
the
sun
into
austere
saints
with
whom
the
most
ascetic
of
monks
would
have
had
but
little
sympathy
i
will
not
dwell
on
those
peculiarities
which
macaulay
ridicules
and
taine
repeats
the
hatred
of
theatres
and
assemblies
and
symbolic
festivals
and
the
rejection
of
the
beautiful
the
elongated
features
the
cropped
hair
the
unadorned
garments
the
proscription
of
innocent
pleasures
the
nasal
voice
the
cant
phrases
the
rigid
decorums
the
strict
discipline
these
doubtless
exaggerated
were
more
than
balanced
by
the
observance
of
the
sabbath
family
prayers
temperate
habits
fervor
of
religious
zeal
strict
morality
allegiance
to
duty
and
the
perpetual
recognition
of
god
almighty
as
the
sovereign
of
this
world
to
whom
we
are
responsible
for
all
our
acts
and
even
our
thoughts
they
formed
a
noble
material
on
which
every
emancipating
idea
could
work
men
trained
by
persecutions
to
and
humble
duties
making
good
soldiers
good
farmers
good
workmen
in
every
department
honest
and
sturdy
patient
and
devoted
to
their
families
though
not
demonstrative
of
affection
keeping
the
sunday
as
a
day
of
worship
rather
than
rest
or
recreation
cherishing
as
the
dearest
and
most
sacred
of
all
privileges
the
right
to
worship
god
according
to
the
dictates
of
conscience
enlightened
by
the
bible
and
willing
to
fight
even
amid
the
greatest
privations
and
sacrifices
to
maintain
this
sacred
right
and
transmit
it
to
their
children
such
were
the
men
who
fought
the
battles
of
civil
liberty
under
cromwell
and
colonized
the
most
sterile
of
all
american
lands
making
the
dreary
wilderness
to
blossom
with
roses
and
sending
out
the
shoots
of
their
civilization
to
conserve
more
fruitful
and
favored
sections
of
the
great
continent
which
god
gave
them
to
try
new
experiments
in
liberty
and
education
i
need
not
enumerate
the
different
sects
into
which
these
puritans
were
divided
so
soon
as
they
felt
they
had
the
right
to
interpret
scripture
for
themselves
nor
would
i
detail
the
various
and
cruel
persecutions
to
which
these
sects
were
subjected
by
the
government
and
the
ecclesiastical
tribunals
until
they
rose
in
indignation
and
despair
and
rebelled
against
the
throne
and
made
war
on
the
king
and
cut
off
his
head
all
of
which
they
did
from
fear
and
for
as
well
as
from
vengeance
and
wrath
nor
can
i
describe
the
counter
reformation
the
great
reaction
which
succeeded
to
the
violence
of
the
revolution
the
english
reformation
was
not
consummated
until
constitutional
liberty
was
heralded
by
the
reign
of
william
and
mary
when
the
nation
became
almost
unanimously
protestant
with
perfect
toleration
of
religious
opinions
although
the
fervor
of
the
puritans
had
passed
away
forever
leaving
a
residuum
of
popular
antipathy
to
all
the
institutions
of
romanism
and
all
the
ideas
of
the
middle
ages
the
english
reformation
began
with
princes
and
ended
with
the
agitations
of
the
people
the
german
reformation
began
with
the
people
and
ended
in
the
wars
of
princes
but
both
movements
were
sublime
since
they
showed
the
force
of
religious
ideas
civil
liberty
is
only
one
of
the
sequences
which
exalt
the
character
and

of

itself
the
most

moral
movement
in
the
history
of
modern
times
was
the
in
the
roman
catholic
church
finally
effected
in
no
slight
degree
by
the
jesuits
but
it
has
not
the
grandeur
or
historical
significance
of
the
great
insurrection
of
human
intelligence
which
was
headed
by
luther
it
was
a
revival
of
the
pietism
of
the
middle
ages
with
an
external
reform
of
manners
it
was
not
revolutionary
it
did
not
cast
off
the
authority
of
the
popes
nor
disband
the
monasteries
nor
reform
religious
worship
it
rather
tended
to
strengthen
the
power
of
the
popes
to
revive
monastic
life
and
to
perpetuate
the
forms
of
worship
which
the
middle
ages
had
established
no
doubt
a
new
religious
life
was
kindled
and
many
of
the
flagrant
abuses
of
the
papal
empire
were
redressed
and
the
lives
of
the
clergy
made
more
decent
in
accordance
with
the
revival
of
intelligence
nor
did
it
disdain
literature
or
art
or
any
form
of
modern
civilization
but
sought
to
combine
progress
with
old
ideas
it
was
an
effort
to
adapt
the
roman
theocracy
to
changing
circumstances
and
was
marked
by
expediency
rather
than
right
by
zeal
rather
than
a
profound
philosophy
this
movement
took
place
among
the
latin
races
the
italians
french
and
spaniards
having
no
hold
on
the
teutonic
races
except
in
austria
as
much
slavonic
as
german
it
worked
on
a
poor
material
morally
considered
among
peoples
who
have
not
been
distinguished
for
stamina
of
character
earnestness
contemplative
habits
and
moral
elevation
peoples
long
enslaved
frivolous
in
their
pleasures
superstitious
indolent
fond
of
fêtes
spectacles
pictures
and
pagan
reminiscences
the
doctrine
of
justification
by
faith
was
not
unknown
even
in
italy
it
was
embraced
by
many
distinguished
men
contarini
an
illustrious
venetian
wrote
a
treatise
on
it
which
cardinal
pole
admired
folengo
ascribed
justification
to
grace
alone
and
vittoria
colonna
the
friend
of
michael
angelo
took
a
deep
interest
in
these
theological
inquiries
but
the
doctrine
did
not
spread
it
was
not
understood
by
the
people
it
was
a
speculation
among
scholars
and
doctors
which
gave
no
alarm
to
the
pope
there
was
even
an
attempt
at
internal
reform
under
paul
iii
of
the
illustrious
family
of
the
farnese
successor
of
leo
and
clement
the
two
renowned
medicean
popes
he
made
cardinals
of
contarini
caraffa
sadoleto
pole
giberto
all
men
imbued
with
protestant
doctrines
and
very
religious
and
these
good
men
prepared
a
plan
of
reform
and
submitted
it
to
the
pope
which
ended
however
only
in
new
monastic
orders
it
was
then
that
ignatius
loyola
appeared
upon
the
stage
when
luther
was
in
the
midst
of
his
victories
and
when
new
ideas
were
shaking
the
pontifical
throne
the
desponding
successor
of
the
gregorys
and
the
clements
knew
not
where
to
look
for
aid
in
that
crisis
of
peril
and
revolution
the
monastic
orders
composed
his
regular
army
but
they
had
become
so
corrupted
that
they
had
lost
the
reverence
of
the
people
the
venerable
benedictines
had
ceased
to
be
men
of
prayer
and
contemplation
as
in
the
times
of
bernard
and
anselm
and
were
revelling
in
their
enormous
wealth
the
cloisters
of
cluniacs
and
cistercians
branches
of
the
benedictines
were
filled
with
idle
and
dissolute
monks
the
famous
dominicans
and
franciscans
who
had
rallied
to
the
defence
of
the
papacy
three
centuries
before
those
missionary
orders
that
had
filled
the
best
pulpits
and
the
highest
chairs
of
philosophy
in
the
scholastic
age
had
become
inexhaustible
subjects
of
sarcasm
and
mockery
for
they
were
peddling
relics
and
indulgences
and
quarrelling
among
themselves
they
were
hated
as
inquisitors
despised
as
scholastics
and
deserted
as
preachers
the
roads
and
taverns
were
filled
with
them
erasmus
laughed
at
them
luther
abused
them
and
the
pope
reproached
them
no
hope
from
such
men
as
these
although
they
had
once
been
renowned
for
their
missions
their
zeal
their
learning
and
their
preaching
at
this
crisis
loyola
and
his
companions
volunteered
their
services
and
offered
to
go
wherever
the
pope
should
send
them
as
preachers
or
missionaries
or
teachers
instantly
without
discussion
conditions
or
rewards
so
the
pope
accepted
them
made
them
a
new
order
of
monks
and
they
did
what
the
mendicant
friars
had
done
three
hundred
years
before
they
fanned
a
new
spirit
and
rapidly
spread
over
europe
over
all
the
countries
to
which
catholic
adventurers
had
penetrated
and
became
the
most
efficient
allies
that
the
popes
ever
had
this
was
in
six
years
after
the
foundation
of
the
society
of
jesus
had
been
laid
on
the
mount
of

the

a
page
at
the
court
of
king
ferdinand
then
a
brave
and
chivalrous
soldier
was
wounded
at
the
siege
of
pampeluna
during
a
slow
convalescence
having
read
all
the
romances
he
could
find
he
took
up
the
lives
of
the
saints
and
became
fired
with
religious
zeal
he
immediately
forsook
the
pursuit
of
arms
and
betook
himself
barefooted
to
a
pilgrimage
he
served
the
sick
in
hospitals
he
dwelt
alone
in
a
cavern
practising
austerities
he
went
as
a
beggar
on
foot
to
rome
and
to
the
holy
land
and
returned
at
the
age
of
to
begin
a
course
of
study
it
was
while
completing
his
studies
at
paris
that
he
conceived
and
formed
the
society
of
jesus
from
that
time
we
date
the
in
fifty
years
more
a
wonderful
change
took
place
in
the
catholic
church
wrought
chiefly
by
the
jesuits
yea
in
sixteen
years
from
that
eventful
night
when
far
above
the
city
the
enthusiastic
loyola
had
bound
his
six
companions
with
irrevocable
vows
he
had
established
his
society
in
the
confidence
and
affection
of
catholic
europe
against
the
voice
of
universities
the
fears
of
monarchs
and
the
jealousy
of
the
other
monastic
orders
in
sixteen
years
this
ridiculed
and
wandering
spanish
fanatic
had
risen
to
a
condition
of
great
influence
and
dignity
second
only
in
power
to
the
pope
himself
animating
the
councils
of
the
vatican
moving
the
minds
of
kings
controlling
the
souls
of
a
numerous
fraternity
and
making
his
influence
felt
in
every
corner
of
the
world
before
the
remembrance
of
his
passionate
eloquence
his
eyes
of
fire
and
his
countenance
of
seraphic
piety
had
passed
away
from
the
minds
of
his
own
generation
his
disciples
had
planted
their
missionary
stations
among
peruvian
mines
in
the
marts
of
the
african
among
the
islands
of
the
indian
ocean
on
the
coasts
of
hindustan
in
the
cities
of
japan
and
china
in
the
recesses
of
canadian
forests
amid
the
wilds
of
the
rocky
mountains
they
had
the
most
important
chairs
in
the
universities
they
were
the
confessors
of
monarchs
and
men
of
rank
they
had
the
control
of
the
schools
of
italy
france
austria
and
spain
and
they
had
become
the
most
eloquent
learned
and
fashionable
preachers
in
all
catholic
countries
they
had
grown
to
be
a
great
institution
an
organization
instinct
with
life
a
mechanism
endued
with
energy
and
will
forming
a
body
which
could
outwatch
argus
with
his
hundred
eyes
and
outwork
briareus
with
his
hundred
arms
they
had
twenty
thousand
eyes
open
upon
every
cabinet
every
palace
and
every
private
family
in
catholic
europe
and
twenty
thousand
arms
extended
over
the
necks
of
every
sovereign
and
all
their
subjects
a
mighty
moral
and
spiritual
power
irresponsible
irresistible
omnipresent
connected
intimately
with
the
education
the
learning
and
the
religion
of
the
age
yea
the
prime
agents
in
political
affairs
the
prop
alike
of
absolute
monarchies
and
of
the
papal
throne
whose
interests
they
made
identical
this
association
instinct
with
one
will
and
for
one
purpose
has
been
beautifully
likened
by
doctor
williams
to
the
chariot
in
the
vision
the
spirit
of
the
living
creatures
was
in
the
wheels
wherever
the
living
creatures
went
the
wheels
went
with
them
wherever
those
stood
these
stood
when
the
living
creatures
were
lifted
up
the
wheels
were
lifted
up
over
against
them
and
their
wings
were
full
of
eyes
round
about
and
they
were
so
high
that
they
were
dreadful
so
of
the
institution
of
ignatius
one
soul
swayed
the
vast
mass
and
every
pin
and
every
cog
in
the
machinery
consented
with
its
whole
power
to
every
movement
of
the
one
central
conscience
luther
moved
europe
by
ideas
which
emancipated
the
millions
and
set
in
motion
a
progress
which
is
the
glory
of
our
age
loyola
invented
a
machine
which
arrested
this
progress
and
drove
the
catholic
world
back
again
into
the
superstitions
and
despotisms
of
the
middle
ages
retaining
however
the
fear
of
god
and
of
hell
which
some
among
the
protestants
care
very
little
about
what
is
the
secret
of
such
a
wonderful
success
two
things
first
the
extraordinary
virtues
abilities
and
zeal
of
the
early
jesuits
and
secondly
their
wonderful
machinery
in
adapting
means
to
an
end
the
history
of
society
shows
that
no
body
of
men
ever
obtained
a
ascendancy
never
secured
general
respect
unless
they
deserved
it
industry
produces
its
fruits
learning
and
piety
have
their
natural
results
even
in
the
moral
world
natural
law
asserts
its
supremacy
hypocrisy
and
fraud
ultimately
will
be
detected
no
enduring
reputation
is
built
upon
a
lie
sincerity
and
earnestness
will
call
out
respect
even
from
foes
learning
and
virtue
are
lights
which
are
not
hid
under
a
bushel
enthusiasm
creates
enthusiasm
a
lofty
life
will
be
seen
and
honored
nor
do
people
intrust
their
dearest
interests
except
to
those
whom
they
venerate
and
venerate
because
their
virtues
shine
like
the
face
of
a
goddess
we
yield
to
those
only
whom
we
esteem
wiser
than
ourselves
moses

they
venerated
his
wisdom
and

paul
had
the
confidence
of
the
infant
churches
because
they
saw
his
labors
bernard
swayed
his
darkened
age
by
the
moral
power
of
learning
and
sanctity
the
mature
judgments

the
judgments

minds
all

even
hildebrand

juggle
himself

washington
deserved
all
the
reverence
he
enjoyed
and
bonaparte
himself
was
worthy
of
the
honors
he
received
so
long
as
he
was
true
to
the
interests
of
france
so
of
the
jesuits
there
is
no
mystery
in
their
success
the
same
causes
would
produce
the
same
results
again
when
catholic
europe
saw
men
born
to
wealth
and
rank
voluntarily
parting
with
their
goods
and
honors
devoting
themselves
to
religious
duties
often
in
a
humble
sphere
spending
their
days
in
schools
and
hospitals
wandering
as
preachers
and
missionaries
amid
privations
and
in
fatigue
encountering
perils
and
dangers
and
hardships
with
fresh
and
enthusiasm
and
finally
yielding
up
their
lives
as
martyrs
to
proclaim
salvation
to
idolatrous
savages
it
knew
them
to
be
heroic
and
believed
them
to
be
sincere
and
honored
them
in
consequence
when
parents
saw
that
the
jesuits
entered
heart
and
soul
into
the
work
of
education
winning
their
pupils
hearts
by
kindness
watching
their
moods
directing
their
minds
into
congenial
studies
and
inspiring
them
with
generous
sentiments
they
did
not
stop
to
pry
into
their
motives
and
universities
when
they
discovered
the
superior
culture
of
educated
jesuits
outstripping
all
their
associates
in
learning
and
shedding
a
light
by
their
genius
and
erudition
very
naturally
appointed
them
to
the
highest
chairs
and
even
the
people
when
they
saw
that
the
jesuits
were
not
stained
by
vulgar
vices
but
were
devoted
to
their
labors
earnest
and
eloquent
put
themselves
under
their
teachings
and
especially
when
they
added
gentlemanly
manners
good
taste
and
agreeable
conversation
to
their
unimpeachable
morality
and
religious
fervor
they
made
these
men
their
confessors
as
well
as
preachers
their
lives
stood
out
in
glorious
contrast
with
those
of
the
old
monks
and
the
regular
clergy
in
an
age
of
infidel
levities
when
the
italian
renaissance
was
bearing
its
worst
fruits
and
men
were
going
back
to
pagan
antiquity
for
their
pleasures
and
opinions
that
the
early
jesuits
blazed
with
virtues
and
learning
and
piety
has
never
been
denied
although
these
things
have
been
poetically
exaggerated
the
world
was
astonished
at
their
intrepidity
zeal
and
devotion
they
were
not
at
first
intriguing
or
ambitious
or
covetous
they
loved
their
society
but
they
loved
still
more
what
they
thought
was
the
glory
of
god
majoram
dei
was
the
motto
which
was
emblazoned
on
their
standard
when
they
went
forth
as
christian
warriors
to
overcome
the
heresies
of
christendom
and
the
superstitions
of
idolaters
the
jesuit
missionary
says
stephen
with
his
breviary
under
his
arm
his
beads
at
his
girdle
and
his
crucifix
in
his
hands
went
forth
without
fear
to
encounter
the
most
dreaded
dangers
martyrdom
was
nothing
to
him
he
knew
that
the
altar
which
might
stream
with
his
blood
and
the
mound
which
might
be
raised
over
his
remains
would
become
a
cherished
object
of
his
fame
and
an
expressive
emblem
of
the
power
of
his
religion
if
i
die
said
xavier
when
about
to
visit
the
cannibal
island
of
del
moro
who
knows
but
what
all
may
receive
the
gospel
since
it
is
most
certain
it
has
ever
fructified
more
abundantly
in
the
field
of
paganism
by
the
blood
of
martyrs
than
by
the
labors
of
missionaries
a
sublime
truth
revealed
to
him
in
his
whole
course
of
protracted
martyrdom
and
active
philanthropy
especially
in
those
last
hours
when
on
the
island
of
sanshan
he
expired
exclaiming
as
his
fading
eyes
rested
on
the
crucifix
te
domine
speravi
non
confundar
in
in
perils
in
fastings
in
fatigues
was
the
life
of
this
remarkable
man
passed
in
order
to
convert
the
heathen
world
and
in
ten
years
he
had
traversed
a
tract
of
more
than
twice
the
circumference
of
the
earth
preaching
disputing
and
baptizing
until
seventy
thousand
converts
it
is
said
were
the
fruits
of
his
mission
my
companion

fearless
marquette
when
exploring
the
prairies
of
the
western
wilderness
is
an
envoy
of
france
to
discover
new
countries
and
i
am
an
ambassador
of

them

lalemant
when
pierced
with
the
arrows
of
the
iroquois
rejoiced
that
his
martyrdom
would
induce
others
to
follow
his
example

missions
of
the
early
jesuits

praises
from
baxter
and

from
liebnitz
footnote
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
this
statement
is
exaggerated
or
if
true
that
conversion
was
merely
nominal
and
not
less
remarkable
than
these
missionaries
were
those
who
labored
in
other
spheres
loyola
himself
though
visionary
and
monastic
had
no
higher
wish
than
to
infuse
piety
into
the
catholic
church
and
to
strengthen
the
hands
of
him
whom
he
regarded
as
god
vicegerent
somehow
or
other
he
succeeded
in
securing
the
absolute
veneration
of
his
companions
so
much
so
that
the
sainted
xavier
always
wrote
to
him
on
his
knees
his
spiritual
exercises
has
ever
remained
the
great
of
the
jesuits
a
compend
of
fasts
and
penances
of
visions
and
of
ecstasies
rivalling
saint
theresa
herself
in
the
rhapsodies
of
a
visionary
piety
showing
the
chivalric
and
romantic
ardor
of
a
spanish
nobleman
directed
into
the
channel
of
devotion
to
an
invisible
lord
see
this
wounded
soldier
at
the
siege
of
pampeluna
going
through
all
the
experiences
of
a
syriac
monk
in
his
manresan
cave
and
then
turning
his
steps
to
paris
to
acquire
a
university
education
associating
only
with
the
pious
and
the
learned
drawing
to
him
such
gifted
men
as
faber
and
xavier
salmeron
and
lainez
borgia
and
bobadilla
and
inspiring
them
with
his
ideas
and
his
fervor
living
afterwards
at
venice
with
caraffa
the
future
paul
iv
in
the
closest
intimacy
preaching
at
vicenza
and
forming
a
new
monastic
code
as
full
of
genius
and
originality
as
it
was
of
practical
wisdom
which
became
the
foundation
of
a
system
of
government
never
surpassed
in
the
power
of
its
mechanism
to
bind
the
minds
and
wills
of
men
loyola
was
a
most
extraordinary
man
in
the
practical
turn
he
gave
to
religious
rhapsodies
creating
a
legislation
for
his
society
which
made
it
the
most
potent
religious
organization
in
the
world
all
his
companions
were
remarkable
likewise
for
different
traits
and
excellences
which
yet
were
made
to
combine
in
sustaining
the
unity
of
this
moral
mechanism
lainez
had
even
a
more
comprehensive
mind
than
loyola
it
was
he
who
matured
the
jesuit
constitution
and
afterwards
controlled
the
council
of
trent
a
convocation
which
settled
the
creed
of
the
catholic
church
especially
in
regard
to
justification
and
which
admitted
the
merits
of
christ
but
attributed
justification
to
good
works
in
a
different
sense
from
that
understood
and
taught
by
luther
aside
from
the
personal
gifts
and
qualities
of
the
early
jesuits
they
would
not
have
so
marvellously
succeeded
had
it
not
been
for
their
remarkable
constitution
that
which
bound
the
members
of
the
society
together
and
gave
to
it
a
peculiar
unity
and
force
the
most
marked
thing
about
it
was
the
unbounded
and
unhesitating
obedience
required
of
every
member
to
superiors
and
of
these
superiors
to
the
general
of
the
order
so
that
there
was
but
one
will
this
law
of
obedience
is
as
every
one
knows
one
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
all
the
monastic
orders
from
the
earliest
times
enforced
by
benedict
as
well
as
basil
still
there
was
a
difference
in
the
vow
of
obedience
the
head
of
a
monastery
in
the
middle
ages
was
almost
supreme
the
lord
abbot
was
obedient
only
to
the
pope
and
he
sought
the
interests
of
his
monastery
rather
than
those
of
the
pope
but
loyola
exacted
obedience
to
the
general
of
the
order
so
absolutely
that
a
jesuit
became
a
slave
this
may
seem
a
harsh
epithet
there
is
nothing
gained
by
using
offensive
words
but
protestant
writers
have
almost
universally
made
these
charges
from
their
interpretation
of
the
constitutions
of
loyola
and
lainez
and
aquaviva
a
member
of
the
society
had
no
will
of
his
own
he
did
not
belong
to
himself
he
belonged
to
his
general
as
in
the
time
of
abraham
a
child
belonged
to
his
father
and
a
wife
to
her
husband
nay
even
still
more
completely
he
could
not
write
or
receive
a
letter
that
was
not
read
by
his
superior
when
he
entered
the
order
he
was
obliged
to
give
away
his
property
but
could
not
give
it
to
his
relatives
when
he
made
confession
he
was
obliged
to
tell
his
most
intimate
and
sacred
secrets
he
could
not
aspire
to
any
higher
rank
than
that
he
held
he
had
no
right
to
be
ambitious
or
seek
his
own
individual
interests
he
was
merged
body
and
soul
into
the
society
he
was
only
a
pin
in
the
machinery
he
was
bound
to
obey
even
his
own
servant
if
required
by
his
superior
he
was
less
than
a
private
soldier
in
an
army
he
was
a
piece
of
wax
to
be
moulded
as
the
superior
directed
and
the
superior
in
his
turn
was
a
piece
of
wax
in
the
hands
of
the
provincial
and
he
again
in
the
hands
of
the
general
there
were
many
gradations
in
rank
but
every
rank
was
a
gradation
in
slavery
the
jesuit
is
accused
of
having
no
individual
conscience
he
was
bound
to
do
what
he
was
told
right
or
wrong
nothing
was
right
and
nothing
was
wrong
except
as
the
society
pronounced
the
general
stood
in
the
place
of
god
that
man
was
the
happiest
who
was
most
mechanical
every
novice
had
a
monitor
and
every
monitor
was
a
spy
so
strict
was
the
rule
of
loyola
that
he
kept
francis
borgia
duke
of
candia
three
years
out
of
the
society
because
he
refused
to
renounce
all
intercourse
with
his
family

the
jesuit
was
obliged
to
make
all
natural
ties
subordinate
to
the
will
of
the
general
and
this
general
was
a
king
more
absolute
than
any
worldly
monarch
because
he
reigned
over
the
minds
of
his
subjects
his
kingdom
was
an
in
he
was
chosen
for
life
and
was
responsible
to
no
one
although
he
ruled
for
the
benefit
of
the
catholic
church
in
one
sense
a
general
of
the
jesuits
resembled
the
prime
minister
of
an
absolute
monarch
say
such
a
man
as
richelieu
with
unfettered
power
in
the
cause
of
absolutism
and
he
ruled
like
richelieu
through
his
spies
making
his
subordinates
tools
and
instruments
the
general
appointed
the
presidents
of
colleges
and
of
the
religious
houses
he
admitted
or
dismissed
dispensed
or
punished
at
his
pleasure
there
was
no
complaint
all
obeyed
his
orders
and
saw
in
him
the
representative
of
divine
providence
complaint
was
sin
resistance
was
ruin
it
is
hard
for
us
to
understand
how
any
man
could
be
brought
voluntarily
to
submit
to
such
a
despotism
but
the
novice
entering
the
order
had
to
go
through
terrible
discipline
to
be
a
servant
anything
to
live
according
to
rigid
rules
so
that
his
spirit
was
broken
by
mechanical
duties
he
had
to
learn
all
the
virtues
of
a
slave
before
he
could
be
fully
enrolled
in
the
society
he
was
drilled
for
years
by
spiritual
sergeants
more
rigorously
than
a
soldier
in
napoleon
army
hence
the
efficiency
of
the
body
it
was
a
spiritual
army
of
the
highest
disciplined
troops
loyola
had
been
a
soldier
he
knew
what
military
discipline
could
do
how
impotent
an
army
is
without
it
what
an
awful
power
it
is
with
discipline
and
the
severer
the
better
the
best
soldier
of
a
modern
army
is
he
who
has
become
an
unconscious
piece
of
machinery
and
it
was
this
unreflecting
unconditional
obedience
which
made
the
society
so
efficient
and
the
general
himself
who
controlled
it
such
an
awful
power
for
good
or
for
evil
i
am
only
speaking
of
the
organization
the
machinery
the
of
the
jesuits
not
of
their
character
not
of
their
virtues
or
vices
this
organization
is
to
be
spoken
of
as
we
speak
of
the
discipline
of
an
army
wise
or
unwise
as
it
reached
its
end
the
original
aim
of
the
jesuits
was
the
restoration
of
the
papal
church
to
its
ancient
power
and
for
one
hundred
years
as
i
think
the
restoration
of
morals
higher
education
greater
zeal
in
preaching
in
short
a
reformation
within
the
church
jesuitism
was
of
course
opposed
to
protestantism
it
hated
the
protestants
it
hated
their
religious
creed
and
their
emancipating
and
progressive
spirit
it
hated
religious
liberty
i
need
not
dwell
on
other
things
which
made
this
order
of
monks
so
successful
not
merely
their
virtues
and
their
mechanism
but
their
adaptation
to
the
changing
spirit
of
the
times
they
threw
away
the
old
dresses
of
monastic
life
they
quitted
the
cloister
and
places
of
meditation
they
were
preachers
as
well
as
scholars
they
accommodated
themselves
to
the
circumstances
of
the
times
they
wore
the
ordinary
dress
of
gentlemen
they
remained
men
of
the
world
of
fine
manners
and
cultivated
speech
there
was
nothing
ascetic
or
repulsive
about
them
like
other
monks
they
were
all
things
to
all
men
like
politicians
in
order
to
accomplish
their
ends
they
never
were
lazy
or
profligate
or
luxurious
if
their
order
became
enriched
they
as
individuals
remained
poor
the
inferior
members
were
not
even
ambitious
like
good
soldiers
they
thought
of
nothing
but
the
work
assigned
to
them
their
pride
and
glory
were
the
prosperity
of
their
order
an
intense
de
never
equalled
by
any
body
of
men
this
of
course
while
it
gave
them
efficiency
made
them
narrow
they
could
see
the
needle
on
the
they
could
not
see
the
door
itself
hence
there
could
be
no
agreement
with
them
no
argument
with
them
except
on
ordinary
matters
they
were
as
zealous
as
saul
seeking
to
make
proselytes
they
yielded
nothing
except
in
order
to
win
they
never
compromised
their
order
in
their
cause
their
fidelity
to
their
head
was
marvellous
and
so
long
as
they
confined
themselves
to
the
work
of
making
people
better
i
think
they
deserved
praise
i
do
not
like
their
military
organization
but
i
should
have
no
more
right
to
abuse
it
than
the
organization
of
some
protestant
sects
that
is
a
matter
of
government
all
sects
and
all
parties
catholic
and
protestant
have
a
right
to
choose
their
own
government
to
carry
out
their
ends
even
as
military
generals
have
a
right
to
organize
their
forces
in
their
own
way
the
history
of
the
jesuits
shows
this
that
an
organization
of
forces
or
what
we
call
discipline
or
government
is
a
great
thing
a
church
without
a
government
is
a
poor
affair
so
far
as
efficiency
is
concerned
all
churches
have
something
to
learn
from
the
jesuits
in
the
way
of
discipline
john
wesley
learned
something
the
independents
learned
very
little
but
there
is
another
side
to
the
jesuits
we
have
seen
why
they
succeeded
we
have
to
inquire
how
they
failed
if
history
speaks
of
the
virtues
of
the
early
members
and
the
wonderful
mechanism
of
their
order
and
their
great
success
in
consequence
it
also
speaks
of
the
errors
they
committed
by
which
they
lost
the
confidence
they
had
gained
from
being
the
most
popular
of
all
the
adherents
of
the
papal
power
and
of
the
ideas
of
the
dark
ages
they
became
the
most
unpopular
they
became
so
odious
that
the
pope
was
obliged
by
the
pressure
of
public
opinion
and
of
the
bourbon
courts
of
europe
to
suppress
their
order
the
fall
of
the
jesuits
was
as
significant
as
their
rise
i
need
not
dwell
on
that
fall
which
is
one
of
the
best
known
facts
of
history
why
did
the
jesuits
become
unpopular
and
lose
their
influence
they
gained
the
confidence
of
catholic
countries
because
they
deserved
it
and
they
lost
that
confidence
because
they
deserved
to
lose
it
in
other
words
because
they
became
corrupt
and
this
seems
to
be
the
history
of
all
institutions
it
is
strange
it
is
passing
strange
that
human
societies
and
governments
and
institutions
should
degenerate
as
soon
as
they
become
rich
and
powerful
but
such
is
the
fact
a
sad
commentary
on
the
doctrine
of
a
necessary
progress
of
the
race
or
the
natural
tendency
to
good
which
so
many
cherish
but
than
which
nothing
can
be
more
false
as
proved
by
experience
and
the
scriptures
why
were
the
antediluvians
swept
away
why
could
not
those
races
retain
their
primitive
revelation
why
did
the
descendants
of
noah
become
almost
idolaters
before
he
was
dead
why
did
the
great
persian
empire
become
as
effeminate
as
the
empires
it
had
supplanted
why
did
the
jewish
nation
steadily
retrograde
after
david
why
did
not
civilization
and
christianity
save
the
roman
world
why
did
christianity
itself
become
corrupted
in
four
centuries
why
did
not
the
middle
ages
preserve
the
evangelical
doctrines
of
augustine
and
jerome
and
chrysostom
and
ambrose
why
did
the
light
of
the
glorious
reformation
of
luther
nearly
go
out
in
the
german
cities
and
universities
why
did
the
fervor
of
the
puritans
burn
out
in
england
in
one
hundred
years
why
have
the
doctrines
of
the
pilgrim
fathers
become
unfashionable
in
those
parts
of
new
england
where
they
seemed
to
have
taken
the
deepest
root
why
have
so
many
of
the
descendants
of
the
disciples
of
george
fox
become
so
liberal
and
advanced
as
to
be
enamoured
of
silk
dresses
and
laces
and
diamonds
and
the
ritualism
of
episcopal
churches
is
it
an
improvement
to
give
up
a
simple
life
and
lofty
religious
enthusiasm
for
materialistic
enjoyments
and
epicurean
display
is
there
a
true
advance
in
a
university
when
it
exchanges
its
theological
teachings
and
its
preparation
of
poor
students
for
the
gospel
ministry
for
schools
of
technology
and
and
accommodations
for
the
sons
of
the
rich
and
worldly
now
the
society
of
jesus
went
through
just
such
a
transformation
as
has
taken
place
almost
within
the
memory
of
living
men
in
the
life
and
habits
and
ideas
of
the
people
of
boston
and
philadelphia
and
in
the
teachings
of
their
universities
some
may
boldly
say
why
not
this
change
indicates
progress
but
this
progress
is
exactly
similar
to
that
progress
which
the
jesuits
made
in
the
magnificence
of
their
churches
in
the
wealth
they
had
hoarded
in
their
colleges
in
the
fashionable
character
of
their
professors
and
confessors
and
preachers
in
the
adaptation
of
their
doctrines
to
the
taste
of
the
rich
and
powerful
in
the
elegance
and
arrogance
and
worldliness
of
their
dignitaries
father
la
chaise
was
an
elegant
and
most
polished
man
of
the
world
and
travelled
in
a
coach
with
six
horses
if
he
had
not
been
such
a
man
he
would
not
have
been
selected
by
louis
xiv
for
his
confidential
and
influential
confessor
the
change
which
took
place
among
the
jesuits
arose
from
the
same
causes
as
the
change
which
has
taken
place
among
methodists
and
quakers
and
puritans
this
change
i
would
not
fiercely
condemn
for
some
think
it
is
progress
but
is
it
progress
in
that
religious
life
which
early
marked
these
people
or
a
progress
towards
worldly
and
epicurean
habits
which
they
arose
to
resist
and
combat
the
early
jesuits
were
visionary
fanatical
strict
ascetic
religious
and
narrow
they
sought
by
labors
and
earnest
exhortations
like
savonarola
at
florence
to
take
the
church
out
of
the
hands
of
the
devil
and
the
people
reverenced
them
as
they
always
have
reverenced
martyrs
and
missionaries
the
later
jesuits
sought
to
enjoy
their
wealth
and
power
and
social
position
they
became
as
rich
and
prosperous
people
generally
become
proud
ambitious
avaricious
and
worldly
they
were
as
elegant
as
scholarly
and
as
luxurious
as
the
fellows
of
oxford
university
and
the
occupants
of
stalls
in
the
english
cathedrals
that
is
all
as
worldly
as
the
professors
of
yale
and
cambridge
may
become
in
if
rich
widows
and
brewers
and
bankers
without
children
shall
some
day
make
those
universities
as
well
endowed
as
jesuit
colleges
were
in
the
eighteenth
century
that
is
the
old
story
of
our
fallen
humanity
i
would
no
more
abuse
the
jesuits
because
they
became
confessors
to
the
great
and
went
into
mercantile
speculations
than
i
would
rich
and
favored
clergymen
in
protestant
countries
who
prefer
ten
per
cent
for
their
money
in
california
mines
to
four
per
cent
in
national
consols
but
the
prosperity
which
the
jesuits
had
earned
during
their
first
century
of
existence
excited
only
envy
and
destroyed
the
reverence
of
the
people
it
had
not
made
them
odious
detestable
it
was
the
means
they
adopted
to
perpetuate
their
influence
after
early
virtues
had
passed
away
which
caused
enlightened
catholic
europe
to
mistrust
them
and
the
protestants
absolutely
to
hate
and
vilify
them
from
the
very
first
the
society
was
distinguished
for
the
de
of
its
members
of
all
things
which
they
loved
best
it
was
the
power
and
glory
of
the
society
just
as
oxford
fellows
love
the
of
their
university
and
this
power
and
influence
the
jesuits
determined
to
preserve
at
all
hazards
and
by
any
means
when
virtues
fled
they
must
find
something
else
with
which
to
bolster
themselves
up
they
must
not
part
with
their
power
the
question
was
how
should
they
keep
it
first
they
adopted
the
doctrine
of
expediency
that
the
end
justifies
the
means
they
did
not
invent
this
sophistry
it
is
as
old
as
our
humanity
abraham
used
it
when
he
told
lies
to
the
king
of
egypt
to
save
the
honor
of
his
wife
caesar
accepted
it
when
he
vindicated
imperialism
as
the
only
way
to
save
the
roman
empire
from
anarchy
most
politicians
resort
to
it
when
they
wish
to
gain
their
ends
politicians
have
ever
been
as
unscrupulous
as
the
jesuits
in
adopting
expediency
rather
than
eternal
right
it
has
been
a
primal
law
of
government
it
lies
at
the
basis
of
english
encroachments
in
india
and
of
the
treatment
of
the
aborigines
in
this
country
by
our
government
there
is
nothing
new
in
the
doctrine
of
expediency
but
the
jesuits
are
accused
of
pushing
this
doctrine
to
its
remotest
consequences
of
being
its
most
unscrupulous
defenders
so
that
and
are
synonymous
are
convertible
terms
they
are
accused
of
perverting
education
of
abusing
the
confessional
of
corrupting
moral
and
political
philosophy
of
conforming
to
the
inclinations
of
the
great
they
even
went
so
far
as
to
inculcate
mental
reservation
thus
attacking
truth
in
its
most
sacred
citadel
the
conscience
of
mankind
on
which
pascal
was
so
severe
they
made
habit
and
bad
example
almost
a
sufficient
exculpation
from
crime
perjury
was
allowable
if
the
perjured
were
inwardly
determined
not
to
swear
they
invented
the
notion
of
probabilities
according
to
which
a
person
might
follow
any
opinion
he
pleased
although
he
knew
it
to
be
wrong
provided
authors
of
reputation
had
defended
that
opinion
a
man
might
fight
a
duel
if
by
refusing
to
fight
he
would
be
stigmatized
as
a
coward
they
did
not
openly
justify
murder
treachery
and
falsehood
but
they
excused
the
same
if
plausible
reasons
could
be
urged
in
their
missions
they
aimed
at
and
hence
merely
nominal
conversions
were
accepted
because
these
swelled
their
numbers
they
gave
the
crucifix
which
covered
up
all
sins
they
permitted
their
converts
to
retain
their
ancient
habits
and
customs
in
order
to
be
popular
robert
de
nobili
it
is
said
traced
his
lineage
to
brahma
and
one
of
their
missionaries
among
the
indians
told
the
savages
that
christ
was
a
warrior
who
scalped
women
and
children
anything
for
an
outward
success
under
their
teachings
it
was
seen
what
a
light
affair
it
was
to
bear
the
yoke
of
christ
so
monarchs
retained
in
their
service
confessors
who
imposed
such
easy
obligations
so
ordinary
people
resorted
to
the
guidance
of
such
leaders
who
made
themselves
agreeable
the
jesuit
colleges
were
filled
with
casuists
their
whole
moral
philosophy
if
we
may
believe
arnauld
and
pascal
was
a
tissue
of
casuistry
truth
was
obscured
in
order
to
secure
popularity
even
the
most
diabolical
persecution
was
justified
if
heretics
stood
in
the
way
father
le
tellier
rejoiced
in
the
slaughter
of
saint
bartholomew
and
were
offered
in
the
churches
for
the
extinction
of
protestantism
by
any
means
if
it
could
be
shown
to
be
expedient
the
jesuits
excused
the
most
outrageous
crimes
ever
perpetrated
on
this
earth
again
the
jesuits
are
accused
of
riveting
fetters
on
the
human
mind
in
order
to
uphold
their
power
and
to
sustain
the
absolutism
of
the
popes
and
the
absolutism
of
kings
to
which
they
were
equally
devoted
they
taught
in
their
schools
the
doctrine
of
passive
obedience
they
aimed
to
subdue
the
will
by
rigid
discipline
they
were
hostile
to
bold
and
free
inquiries
they
were
afraid
of
science
they
hated
such
men
as
galileo
pascal
and
bacon
they
detested
the
philosophers
who
prepared
the
way
for
the
french
revolution
they
abominated
the
protestant
idea
of
private
judgment
they
opposed
the
progress
of
human
thought
and
were
enemies
alike
of
the
jansenist
movement
in
the
seventeenth
century
and
of
the
french
revolution
in
the
eighteenth
they
upheld
the
absolutism
of
louis
and
combated
the
english
revolution
they
sent
their
spies
and
agents
to
england
to
undermine
the
throne
of
elizabeth
and
build
up
the
throne
of
charles
i
every
emancipating
idea
in
politics
and
in
religion
they
detested
there
were
many
things
in
their
system
of
education
to
be
commended
they
were
good
classical
scholars
and
taught
greek
and
latin
admirably
they
cultivated
the
memory
they
made
study
pleasing
but
they
did
not
develop
genius
the
order
never
produced
a
great
philosopher
the
energies
of
its
members
were
concentrated
in
imposing
a
despotic
yoke
the
jesuits
are
accused
further
of
political
intrigues
this
is
a
common
and
notorious
charge
they
sought
to
control
the
cabinets
of
europe
they
had
their
spies
in
every
country
the
intrigues
of
campion
and
parsons
in
england
aimed
at
the
restoration
of
catholic
monarchs
mary
of
scotland
was
a
tool
in
their
hands
and
so
was
madame
de
maintenon
in
france
la
chaise
and
le
tellier
were
mere
politicians
the
jesuits
were
ever
political
priests
the
history
of
europe
the
last
three
hundred
years
is
full
of
their
cabals
their
political
influence
was
directed
to
the
persecution
of
protestants
as
well
as
infidels
they
are
accused
of
securing
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
one
of
the
greatest
crimes
in
the
history
of
modern
times
which
led
to
the
expulsion
of
four
hundred
thousand
protestants
from
france
and
the
execution
of
four
hundred
thousand
more
they
incited
the
dragonnades
of
louis
who
was
under
their
influence
they
are
accused
of
the
assassination
of
kings
of
the
fires
of
smithfield
of
the
gunpowder
plot
of
the
cruelties
inflicted
by
alva
of
the
thirty
years
war
of
the
ferocities
of
the
guises
of
inquisitions
and
massacres
of
sundry
other
political
crimes
with
what
justice
i
do
not
know
but
certain
it
is
they
became
objects
of
fear
and
incurred
the
hostilities
of
catholic
europe
especially
of
all
liberal
thinkers
and
their
downfall
was
demanded
by
the
very
courts
of
europe
why
did
they
lose
their
popularity
why
were
they
so
distrusted
and
hated
the
fact
that
they
hated
is
most
undoubted
and
there
must
have
been
cause
for
it
it
is
a
fact
that
at
one
time
they
were
respected
and
honored
and
deserved
to
be
so
must
there
not
have
been
grave
reasons
for
the
universal
change
in
public
opinion
respecting
them
the
charges
against
them
to
which
i
have
alluded
must
have
had
foundation
they
did
not
become
idle
gluttonous
ignorant
and
sensual
like
the
old
monks
they
became
greedy
of
power
and
in
order
to
retain
it
resorted
to
intrigues
conspiracies
and
persecutions
they
corrupted
philosophy
and
morality
abused
the
confessional
privilege
adopted
as
their
watchword
without
regard
to
the
means
they
are
charged
with
becoming
worldly
ambitious
mercenary
unscrupulous
cruel
above
all
they
sought
to
bind
the
minds
of
men
with
a
despotic
yoke
and
waged
war
against
all
liberalizing
influences
they
always
were
from
first
to
last
narrow
pedantic
legal
technical
pharisaical
the
best
thing
about
them
in
the
days
of
their
declining
power
was
that
they
always
opposed
infidel
sentiments
they
hated
voltaire
and
rousseau
and
the
encyclopedists
as
much
as
they
did
luther
and
calvin
they
detested
the
principles
of
the
french
revolution
partly
because
those
principles
were
godless
partly
because
they
were
emancipating
of
course
in
such
an
infidel
and
revolutionary
age
as
that
of
louis
xv
when
voltaire
was
the
oracle
of
europe
when
from
his
chateau
near
geneva
he
controlled
the
mind
of
europe
as
calvin
did
two
centuries
earlier
enemies
would
rise
up
on
all
sides
against
the
jesuits
their
most
powerful
and
bitter
foe
was
a
woman
the
mistress
of
louis
the
infamous
madame
de
pompadour
she
hated
the
jesuits
as
catharine
de
medici
hated
the
calvinists
in
the
time
of
charles
not
because
they
were
friends
of
absolutism
not
because
they
wrote
casuistic
books
not
because
they
opposed
liberal
principles
not
because
they
were
spies
and
agents
of
rome
not
because
they
perverted
education
not
because
they
were
boastful
and
mercenary
missionaries
or
cunning
intriguers
in
the
courts
of
princes
not
because
they
had
marked
their
course
through
europe
in
a
trail
of
blood
but
because
they
were
hostile
to
her
ascendency
a
woman
who
exercised
about
the
same
influence
in
france
as
jezebel
did
at
the
court
of
ahab
i
respect
the
jesuits
for
the
stand
they
took
against
this
woman
it
is
the
best
thing
in
their
history
but
here
they
did
not
show
their
usual
worldly
wisdom
and
they
failed
they
were
judicially
blinded
the
instrument
of
their
humiliation
was
a
wicked
woman
so
strange
are
the
ways
of
providence
he
chose
esther
to
save
the
jewish
nation
and
a
harlot
to
punish
the
jesuits
she
availed
herself
of
their
mistakes
it
seems
that
the
superior
of
the
jesuits
at
martinique
failed
for
the
jesuits
embarked
in
commercial
speculations
while
officiating
as
missionaries
the
angry
creditors
of
la
valette
the
jesuit
banker
demanded
repayment
from
the
order
they
refused
to
pay
his
debts
the
case
was
carried
to
the
courts
and
the
highest
tribunal
decided
against
them
that
was
not
the
worst
in
the
course
of
the
legal
proceedings
the
mysterious
rule
of
the
jesuits
that
which
was
so
carefully
concealed
from
the
public
was
demanded
then
all
was
revealed
all
that
pascal
had
accused
them
of
and
the
whole
nation
was
indignant
a
great
storm
was
raised
the
parliament
of
paris
decreed
the
constitution
of
the
society
to
be
fatal
to
all
government
the
king
wished
to
save
them
for
he
knew
that
they
were
the
best
supporters
of
the
throne
of
absolutism
but
he
could
not
resist
the
pressure
the
torrent
of
public
opinion
the
entreaties
of
his
mistress
the
arguments
of
his
ministers
he
was
compelled
to
demand
from
the
pope
the
abrogation
of
their
charter
other
monarchs
did
the
same
all
the
bourbon
courts
in
europe
for
the
king
of
portugal
narrowly
escaped
assassination
from
a
fanatical
jesuit
had
the
jesuits
consented
to
a
reform
they
might
not
have
fallen
but
they
would
make
no
concessions
said
ricci
their
general
ut
sunt
aut
non
the
pope
clement
was
obliged
to
part
with
his
best
soldiers
europe
catholic
europe
demanded
the
sacrifice
the
kings
of
spain
of
france
of
naples
of
portugal
feci
compulsus
exclaimed
the
pope
the
feeble
and
pious
ganganelli
so
that
in
by
a
papal
decree
the
order
was
suppressed
colleges
were
closed
missions
were
abandoned
and
more
than
members
were
dispersed
i
do
not
know
what
became
of
their
property
which
amounted
to
about
two
hundred
millions
of
dollars
in
the
various
countries
of
europe
this
seems
to
me
to
have
been
a
clear
case
of
religious
persecution
incited
by
jealous
governments
and
the
infidel
or
the
progressive
spirit
of
the
age
on
the
eve
of
the
french
revolution
it
simply
marks
the
hostilities
which
for
various
reasons
they
had
called
out
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
their
faults
were
greatly
exaggerated
but
it
is
certain
that
so
severe
and
a
measure
would
not
have
been
taken
by
the
pope
had
it
not
seemed
to
him
necessary
to
preserve
the
peace
of
the
church
had
they
been
innocent
the
pope
would
have
lost
his
throne
sooner
than
commit
so
great
a
wrong
on
his
most
zealous
servants
it
is
impossible
for
a
protestant
to
tell
how
far
they
were
guilty
of
the
charges
preferred
against
them
i
do
not
believe
that
their
lives
as
a
general
thing
were
a
scandal
sufficient
to
justify
so
sweeping
a
measure
but
their
institution
their
régime
their
organization
their
constitution
were
deemed
hostile
to
liberty
and
the
progress
of
society
and
if
zealous
governments
catholic
princes
themselves
should
feel
that
the
jesuits
were
opposed
to
the
true
progress
of
nations
how
much
more
reason
had
protestants
to
distrust
them
and
to
rejoice
in
their
fall
and
it
was
not
until
the
french
revolution
and
the
empire
of
napoleon
had
passed
away
not
until
the
bourbons
had
been
restored
nearly
half
a
century
that
the
order
was
and
again
protected
by
the
papal
court
they
have
now
regained
their
ancient
power
and
seem
to
have
the
confidence
of
catholic
europe
some
of
their
most
flourishing
seminaries
are
in
the
united
states
they
are
certainly
not
a
scandal
in
this
country
although
their
spirit
and
institution
are
the
same
as
ever
mistrusted
and
disliked
and
feared
by
the
protestants
as
a
matter
of
course
as
such
a
powerful
organization
naturally
would
be
hostile
still
to
the
circulation
of
the
scriptures
among
the
people
and
free
inquiry
and
private
judgment
in
short
to
all
the
ideas
of
the
reformation
but
whatever
they
are
and
however
much
the
protestants
dislike
them
they
have
in
our
country
this
land
of
unbounded
religious
toleration
the
same
right
to
their
religion
and
their
ecclesiastical
government
that
protestant
sects
have
and
if
protestants
would
nullify
their
influence
so
far
as
it
is
bad
they
must
outshine
them
in
virtues
in
a
religious
life
in
zeal
and
in
devotion
to
the
spiritual
interests
of
the
people
if
the
jesuits
keep
better
schools
than
protestants
they
will
be
patronized
and
if
they
command
the
respect
of
the
catholics
for
their
virtues
and
intelligence
whatever
may
be
the
machinery
of
their
organization
they
will
retain
their
power
and
not
until
they
interfere
with
elections
and
protestant
schools
or
teach
dangerous
doctrines
of
public
morality
has
our
government
any
right
to
interfere
with
them
they
will
stand
or
fall
as
they
win
the
respect
or
excite
the
wrath
of
enlightened
nations
but
the
principles
they
are
supposed
to
defend
expediency
casuistry
and
hostility
to
free
inquiry
and
the
circulation
of
the
scriptures
in
vernacular
languages
these
are
just
causes
of
complaint
and
of
unrelenting
opposition
among
all
those
who
accept
the
great
ideas
of
the
protestant
reformation
since
they
are
antagonistic
to
what
we
deem
most
precious
in
our
institutions
so
long
as
the
contest
shall
last
between
good
and
evil
in
this
world
we
have
a
right
to
declaim
against
all
encroachments
on
liberty
and
sound
morality
and
an
evangelical
piety
from
any
quarter
whatever
and
we
are
recreant
to
our
duties
unless
we
speak
our
minds
hence
from
the
light
i
have
i
pronounce
judgment
against
the
society
of
jesus
as
a
dangerous
institution
unfortunately
planted
among
us
but
which
we
can
not
help
and
can
attack
only
with
the
weapons
of
reason
and
truth
and
yet
i
am
free
to
say
that
for
my
part
i
prefer
even
the
jesuit
discipline
and
doctrines
much
as
i
dislike
them
to
the
unblushing
infidelity
which
has
lately
been
propagated
by
those
who
call
themselves
and
which
seems
to
have
reached
and
even
permeated
many
of
the
schools
of
science
the
newspapers
periodicals
clubs
and
even
pulpits
of
this
materialistic
though
progressive
country
i
make
war
on
the
slavery
of
the
will
and
a
religion
of
formal
technicalities
but
i
prefer
these
evils
to
a
godless
rationalism
and
the
extinction
of
the
light
of
faith

protestant
theology
john
calvin
was
the
theologian
of
the
reformation
and
stamped
his
genius
on
the
thinking
of
his
age
equally
an
authority
with
the
swiss
the
dutch
the
huguenots
and
the
puritans
his
vast
influence
extends
to
our
own
times
his
fame
as
a
benefactor
of
mind
is
immortal
although
it
can
not
be
said
that
he
is
as
much
admired
and
extolled
now
as
he
was
fifty
years
ago
nor
was
he
ever
a
favorite
with
the
english
church
he
has
been
even
grossly
misrepresented
by
theological
opponents
but
no
critic
or
historian
has
ever
questioned
his
genius
his
learning
or
his
piety
no
one
denies
that
he
has
exerted
a
great
influence
on
protestant
countries
as
a
theologian
he
ranks
with
saint
augustine
and
thomas
aquinas
maintaining
essentially
the
same
views
as
those
held
by
these
great
lights
and
being
distinguished
for
the
same
logical
power
reigning
like
them
as
an
intellectual
dictator
in
the
schools
but
not
so
interesting
as
they
were
as
men
and
he
was
more
than
a
theologian
he
was
a
reformer
and
legislator
laying
down
rules
of
government
organizing
church
discipline
and
carrying
on
reforms
in
the
worship
of
god
second
only
to
luther
his
labors
were
prodigious
as
theologian
commentator
and
ecclesiastical
legislator
and
we
are
surprised
that
a
man
with
so
feeble
a
body
could
have
done
so
much
work
calvin
was
born
in
picardy
in
the
year
that
henry
viii
ascended
the
british
throne
and
the
year
that
luther
began
to
preach
at
wittenberg
he
was
not
a
peasant
son
like
luther
but
belonged
to
what
the
world
calls
a
good
family
intellectually
he
was
precocious
and
received
an
excellent
education
at
a
college
in
paris
being
destined
for
the
law
by
his
father
who
sent
him
to
the
university
of
orleans
and
then
to
bourges
where
he
studied
under
eminent
jurists
and
made
the
acquaintance
of
many
distinguished
men
his
conversion
took
place
about
the
year
when
he
was
twenty
and
this
gave
a
new
direction
to
his
studies
and
his
life
he
was
a
young
man
with
sparkling
eyes
sedate
and
earnest
beyond
his
years
he
was
when
he
published
the
books
of
seneca
on
clemency
with
learned
commentaries
at
the
age
of
he
was
in
communion
with
the
reformers
of
germany
and
was
acknowledged
to
be
even
at
that
early
age
the
head
of
the
reform
party
in
france
in
he
went
to
paris
then
as
always
the
centre
of
the
national
life
where
the
new
ideas
were
creating
great
commotion
in
scholarly
and
ecclesiastical
circles
and
even
in
the
court
itself
giving
offence
to
the
doctors
of
the
sorbonne
for
his
evangelical
views
as
to
justification
he
was
obliged
to
seek
refuge
with
the
queen
of
navarre
whose
castle
at
pau
was
the
resort
of
persecuted
reformers
after
leading
rather
a
fugitive
life
in
different
parts
of
france
he
retreated
to
switzerland
and
at
published
his
celebrated
institutes
which
he
dedicated
to
francis
hoping
to
convert
him
to
the
protestant
faith
after
a
short
residence
in
italy
at
the
court
of
the
duchess
of
ferrara
he
took
up
his
abode
at
geneva
and
his
great
career
began
geneva
a
city
of
the
allobroges
in
the
time
of
caesar
possessed
at
this
time
about
twenty
thousand
inhabitants
and
was
a
free
state
having
a
constitution
somewhat
like
that
of
florence
when
it
was
under
the
control
of
savonarola
it
had
rebelled
against
the
duke
of
savoy
who
seems
to
have
been
in
the
fifteenth
century
its
patron
ruler
the
government
of
this
little
savoyard
state
became
substantially
like
that
which
existed
among
the
swiss
cantons
the
supreme
power
resided
in
the
council
of
two
hundred
which
alone
had
the
power
to
make
or
abolish
laws
there
was
a
lesser
council
of
sixty
for
diplomatic
objects
only
the
first
person
who
preached
the
reformed
doctrines
in
geneva
was
the
missionary
farel
a
french
nobleman
spiritual
romantic
and
zealous
he
had
great
success
although
he
encountered
much
opposition
and
wrath
but
the
reformed
doctrines
were
already
established
in
zurich
berne
and
basle
chiefly
through
the
preaching
of
ulrich
zwingli
and
oecolampadius
the
apostolic
farel
welcomed
with
great
cordiality
the
arrival
of
calvin
then
already
known
as
an
extraordinary
man
though
only
years
of
age
he
came
to
geneva
poor
and
remained
poor
all
his
life
all
his
property
at
his
death
amounted
to
only
two
hundred
dollars
as
a
minister
in
one
of
the
churches
he
soon
began
to
exert
a
marvellous
influence
he
must
have
been
eloquent
for
he
was
received
with
enthusiasm
this
was
in
but
he
soon
met
with
obstacles
he
was
worried
by
the
anabaptists
and
even
his
orthodoxy
was
impeached
by
one
coroli
who
made
much
mischief
so
that
calvin
was
obliged
to
publish
his
genevan
catechism
in
latin
he
also
offended
many
by
his
outspoken
rebuke
of
sin
for
he
aimed
at
a
complete
reformation
of
morals
like
latimer
in
london
and
like
savonarola
at
florence
he
sought
to
reprove
amusements
which
were
demoralizing
or
thought
to
be
so
in
their
influence
the
passions
of
the
people
were
excited
and
the
city
was
torn
by
parties
and
such
was
the
reluctance
to
submit
to
the
discipline
of
the
ministers
that
they
refused
to
administer
the
sacraments
this
created
such
a
ferment
that
the
syndics
expelled
calvin
and
farel
from
the
city
they
went
at
first
to
berne
but
the
bernese
would
not
receive
them
they
then
retired
to
basle
wearied
wet
and
hungry
and
from
basle
they
went
to
strasburg
it
was
in
this
city
that
calvin
dwelt
three
years
spending
his
time
in
lecturing
on
divinity
in
making
contributions
to
exegetical
theology
in
perfecting
his
institutes
forming
a
close
alliance
with
melancthon
and
other
leading
reformers
so
was
he
with
his
labors
as
a
commentator
of
the
scriptures
that
he
even
contemplated
withdrawing
from
the
public
service
of
religion
calvin
was
a
scholar
as
well
as
theologian
and
quiet
labors
in
his
library
were
probably
more
congenial
to
his
tastes
than
active
parochial
duties
his
highest
life
was
amid
his
books
in
serene
repose
and
lofty
contemplation
at
this
time
he
had
an
extensive
correspondence
his
advice
being
much
sought
for
its
wisdom
and
moderation
his
judgment
was
almost
unerring
since
he
was
never
led
away
by
extravagances
or
enthusiasm
a
cold
calm
man
even
among
his
friends
and
admirers
he
had
no
passions
he
was
all
intellect
it
would
seem
that
in
his
exile
he
gave
lectures
on
divinity
being
invited
by
the
council
of
strasburg
and
also
interested
himself
in
reference
to
the
sacrament
of
the
supper
which
he
would
withhold
from
the
unworthy
he
lived
quietly
in
his
retreat
and
was
much
respected
by
the
people
of
the
city
where
he
dwelt
in
a
convention
was
held
at
frankfort
at
which
calvin
was
present
as
the
envoy
of
the
city
of
strasburg
here
for
the
first
time
he
met
melancthon
but
there
was
no
close
intimacy
between
them
until
these
two
great
men
met
in
the
following
year
at
a
diet
which
was
summoned
at
worms
by
the
emperor
charles
in
order
to
produce
concord
between
the
catholics
and
protestants
and
which
was
afterwards
removed
to
ratisbon
melancthon
represented
one
party
and
doctor
eck
the
other
melancthon
and
bucer
were
inclined
to
peace
and
cardinal
contarini
freely
offered
his
hand
agreeing
with
the
reformers
to
adopt
the
idea
of
justification
as
his
starting
point
allowing
that
it
proceeds
from
faith
without
any
merit
of
our
own
but
like
luther
and
calvin
he
opposed
any
attempt
at
union
which
might
compromise
the
truth
and
had
no
faith
in
the
movement
neither
party
as
it
was
to
be
expected
was
satisfied
the
main
subject
of
the
dispute
was
in
reference
to
the
eucharist
calvin
denied
the
real
presence
of
christ
in
the
sacrament
regarding
it
as
a
symbol
though
one
of
special
divine
influence
but
on
this
point
the
catholics
have
ever
been
uncompromising
from
the
times
of
berengar
nor
was
luther
fully
emancipated
from
the
catholic
doctrine
modifying
without
essentially
changing
it
calvin
maintained
that
this
is
my
body
meant
that
it
signified
my
body
in
regard
to
original
sin
and
as
represented
by
augustine
there
was
no
dispute
but
much
difficulty
attended
the
interpretation
of
the
doctrine
of
justification
the
greatest
difficulty
was
in
reference
to
the
doctrine
of
transubstantiation
which
was
rejected
by
the
reformers
because
it
had
not
the
sanction
of
the
scriptures
and
when
it
was
found
that
this
caused
insuperable
difficulties
about
the
lord
supper
it
was
thought
useless
to
proceed
to
other
matters
like
confession
masses
for
the
dead
and
the
withholding
the
cup
from
the
laity
there
was
not
so
great
a
difference
between
the
catholic
and
protestant
theologians
concerning
the
main
body
of
dogmatic
divinity
as
is
generally
supposed
the
fundamental
questions
pertaining
to
god
the
trinity
the
mission
and
divinity
of
christ
original
sin
grace
predestination
had
been
formulated
by
thomas
aquinas
with
as
much
severity
as
by
calvin
the
great
subjects
at
issue
in
a
strictly
theological
view
were
justification
and
the
eucharist
respecting
and
predestination
the
catholic
theologians
have
never
been
agreed
among
themselves
some
siding
with
augustine
like
aquinas
bernard
and
anselm
and
some
with
pelagius
like
abélard
and
lainez
the
jesuit
at
the
council
of
trent
a
council
assembled
by
the
pope
with
the
concurrence
of
charles
of
germany
and
francis
of
france
the
decrees
of
which
against
the
authority
of
augustine
in
this
matter
seem
to
be
now
the
established
faith
of
the
roman
catholic
church
after
the
diet
of
ratisbon
calvin
returned
to
geneva
at
the
eager
desire
of
the
people
the
great
council
summoned
him
to
return
every
voice
was
raised
for
him
calvin
that
learned
and
righteous
man
they
said
it
is
he
whom
we
would
have
as
the
minister
of
the
lord
yet
he
did
not
willingly
return
he
preferred
his
quiet
life
at
strasburg
but
obeyed
the
voice
of
conscience
on
the
of
september
he
returned
to
his
penitent
congregation
and
was
received
by
the
whole
city
with
every
demonstration
of
respect
and
a
cloth
cloak
was
given
him
as
a
present
which
he
seemed
to
need
the
same
year
he
was
married
to
a
widow
idelette
de
burie
who
was
a
worthy
woman
with
whom
he
lived
happily
for
nine
years
until
her
death
she
was
superior
to
luther
wife
catherine
bora
in
culture
and
dignity
and
was
a
helpmate
who
never
opposed
her
husband
in
the
slightest
matter
always
considering
his
interests
esteem
and
friendship
seem
to
have
been
the
basis
of
this
union
not
passionate
love
which
calvin
did
not
think
much
of
when
his
wife
died
it
seems
he
mourned
for
her
with
decent
grief
but
did
not
seek
a
second
marriage
perhaps
because
he
was
unable
to
support
a
wife
on
his
small
stipend
as
she
would
wish
and
expect
he
rather
courted
poverty
and
refused
reasonable
gratuities
his
body
was
attenuated
by
fasting
and
study
like
that
of
saint
bernard
when
he
was
completing
his
institutes
he
passed
days
without
eating
and
nights
without
sleeping
and
as
he
practised
poverty
he
had
a
right
to
inculcate
it
he
kept
no
servant
lived
in
a
small
tenement
and
was
always
poorly
clad
he
derived
no
profit
from
any
of
his
books
and
the
only
present
he
ever
consented
to
receive
was
a
silver
goblet
from
the
lord
of
varennes
luther
stipend
was
four
hundred
and
fifty
florins
and
he
too
refused
a
yearly
gift
from
the
booksellers
of
four
hundred
dollars
not
wishing
to
receive
a
gratuity
for
his
writings
calvin
salary
was
only
fifty
dollars
a
year
with
a
house
twelve
measures
of
corn
and
two
pipes
of
wine
for
tea
and
coffee
were
then
unknown
in
europe
and
wine
seems
to
have
been
the
usual
beverage
after
water
he
was
a
conscientious
man
not
allowing
his
feelings
to
sway
his
judgment
he
was
sedate
and
dignified
and
cheerful
though
bossuet
accuses
him
of
a
surly
disposition
genre
triste
un
esprit
though
formal
and
stern
women
never
shrank
from
familiar
conversation
with
him
on
the
subject
of
religion
though
intolerant
of
error
he
cherished
no
personal
animosities
calvin
was
more
refined
than
luther
and
never
like
him
gave
vent
to
coarse
expressions
he
had
not
luther
physical
strength
nor
his
versatility
of
genius
nor
as
a
reformer
was
he
so
violent
luther
aroused
calvin
tranquillized
the
one
stormed
the
great
citadel
of
error
the
other
furnished
the
weapons
for
holding
it
after
it
was
taken
the
former
was
more
popular
the
latter
appealed
to
a
higher
intelligence
the
saxon
reformer
was
more
eloquent
the
swiss
reformer
was
more
dialectical
the
one
advocated
unity
the
other
theocracy
luther
was
broader
calvin
engrafted
on
his
reforms
the
old
testament
observances
the
watchword
of
the
one
was
grace
that
of
the
other
was
predestination
luther
cut
knots
calvin
made
systems
luther
destroyed
calvin
legislated
his
great
principle
of
government
was
aristocratic
he
wished
to
see
both
church
and
state
governed
by
a
select
few
of
able
men
in
all
his
writings
we
see
no
trace
of
popular
sovereignty
he
interested
himself
like
savonarola
in
political
institutions
but
would
separate
the
functions
of
the
magistracy
from
those
of
the
clergy
and
he
clung
to
the
notion
of
a
theocratic
government
like
jewish
legislators
and
the
popes
themselves
the
idea
of
a
theocracy
was
the
basis
of
calvin
system
of
legislation
as
it
was
that
of
leo
i
he
desired
that
the
temporal
power
should
rule
in
the
name
of
god
should
be
the
arm
by
which
spiritual
principles
should
be
enforced
he
did
not
object
to
the
spiritual
domination
of
the
popes
so
far
as
it
was
in
accordance
with
the
word
of
god
he
wished
to
realize
the
grand
idea
which
the
middle
ages
sought
for
but
sought
for
in
vain
that
the
church
must
always
remain
the
mother
of
spiritual
principles
but
he
objected
to
the
exercise
of
temporal
power
by
churchmen
as
well
as
to
the
interference
of
the
temporal
power
in
matters
purely
spiritual
virtually
the
doctrine
of
anselm
and
becket
but
unlike
becket
calvin
would
not
screen
clergymen
accused
of
crime
from
temporal
tribunals
he
rather
sought
the
humiliation
of
the
clergy
in
temporal
matters
he
also
would
destroy
inequalities
of
rank
and
do
away
with
church
dignitaries
like
bishops
and
deans
and
archdeacons
and
he
instituted
twice
as
many
laymen
as
clergymen
in
ecclesiastical
assemblies
but
he
gave
to
the
clergy
the
exclusive
right
to
excommunicate
and
to
regulate
the
administration
of
the
sacraments
he
was
himself
a
in
his
spirit
both
in
reference
to
the
divine
institution
of
the
presbyterian
form
of
government
and
the
ascendancy
of
the
church
as
a
great
power
in
the
world
calvin
exercised
a
great
influence
on
the
civil
polity
of
geneva
although
it
was
established
before
he
came
to
the
city
he
undertook
to
frame
for
the
state
a
code
of
morals
he
limited
the
freedom
of
the
citizens
and
turned
the
old
democratic
constitution
into
an
oligarchy
the
general
assembly
which
met
twice
a
year
nominated
syndics
or
judges
but
nothing
was
proposed
in
the
general
assembly
which
had
not
previously
been
considered
in
the
council
of
the
two
hundred
and
nothing
in
the
latter
which
had
not
been
brought
before
the
council
of
sixty
nor
even
in
this
which
had
not
been
approved
by
the
lesser
council
the
four
syndics
with
their
council
of
sixteen
had
power
of
life
and
death
and
the
whole
public
business
of
the
state
was
in
their
hands
the
supreme
legislation
was
in
the
council
of
two
hundred
which
was
much
influenced
by
ecclesiastics
or
the
consistory
if
a
man
not
forbidden
to
take
the
sacrament
neglected
to
receive
it
he
was
condemned
to
banishment
for
a
year
one

legislation

holidays
and

exhibitions
excommunication
was
as
much
dreaded
as
in
the
mediaeval
church
in
regard
to
the
worship
of
god
calvin
was
opposed
to
splendid
churches
and
to
all
ritualism
he
retained
but
abolished
the
organ
he
removed
the
altar
the
crucifix
and
muniments
from
the
churches
and
closed
them
during
the
unless
the
minister
was
present
he
despised
what
we
call
art
especially
artistic
music
nor
did
he
have
much
respect
for
artificial
sermons
or
the
art
of
speaking
he
himself
preached
nor
is
there
evidence
that
he
ever
wrote
a
sermon
respecting
the
eucharist
calvin
took
a
middle
course
between
luther
and
zwingli
believing
neither
in
the
actual
presence
of
christ
in
the
consecrated
bread
nor
regarding
it
as
a
mere
symbol
but
a
means
by
which
divine
grace
is
imparted
a
mirror
in
which
we
may
contemplate
christ
baptism
he
considered
only
as
an
indication
of
divine
grace
and
not
essential
to
salvation
thereby
differing
from
luther
and
the
catholic
church
yet
he
was
as
strenuous
in
maintaining
these
sacraments
as
a
catholic
priest
and
made
excommunication
as
fearful
a
weapon
as
it
was
in
the
middle
ages
for
admission
to
the
lord
supper
and
thus
to
the
membership
of
the
visible
church
it
would
seem
that
his
requirements
were
not
rigid
but
rather
very
simple
like
those
of
the
primitive
christians
namely
faith
in
god
and
faith
in
christ
without
any
subtile
and
metaphysical
creeds
such
as
one
might
expect
from
his
inexorable
theological
deductions
but
he
would
resort
to
excommunication
as
a
discipline
as
the
only
weapon
which
the
church
could
use
to
bind
its
members
together
and
which
had
been
used
from
the
beginning
yet
he
would
temper
severity
with
mildness
and
charity
since
only
god
is
able
to
judge
the
heart
and
herein
he
departed
from
the
customs
of
the
middle
ages
and
did
not
regard
the
excommunicated
as
lost
but
to
be
prayed
for
by
the
faithful
no
one
he
maintained
should
be
judged
as
deserving
eternal
death
who
was
still
in
the
hands
of
god
he
made
a
broad
distinction
between
excommunication
and
anathema
the
latter
he
maintained
should
never
or
very
rarely
be
pronounced
since
it
takes
away
the
hope
of
forgiveness
and
consigns
one
to
the
wrath
of
god
and
the
power
of
satan
he
regarded
the
sacrament
of
the
lord
supper
as
a
means
to
help
manifold
infirmities
as
a
time
of
meditation
for
beholding
christ
the
crucified
as
confirming
reconciliation
with
god
as
a
visible
sign
of
the
body
of
christ
recognizing
his
actual
but
spiritual
presence
luther
recognized
the
bodily
presence
of
christ
in
the
eucharist
while
he
rejected
transubstantiation
and
the
idea
of
worshipping
the
consecrated
wafer
as
the
real
god
this
difference
in
the
opinion
of
the
reformers
as
to
the
eucharist
led
to
bitter
quarrels
and
controversies
and
divided
the
protestants
calvin
pursued
a
middle
and
moderate
course
and
did
much
to
harmonize
the
protestant
churches
he
always
sought
peace
and
moderation
and
his
tranquillizing
measures
were
not
pleasant
to
the
catholics
who
wished
to
see
divisions
among
their
enemies
calvin
had
a
great
dislike
of
ceremonies
festivals
holidays
and
the
like
for
images
he
had
an
aversion
amounting
to
horror
christmas
was
the
only
festival
he
retained
he
was
even
slanderously
accused
of
wishing
to
abolish
the
sabbath
the
observance
of
which
he
inculcated
with
the
strictness
of
the
puritans
he
introduced
congregational
singing
but
would
not
allow
the
ear
or
the
eye
to
be
distracted
the
music
was
simple
dispensing
with
organs
and
instruments
and
all
elaborate
and
artistic
display
it
is
needless
to
say
that
this
severe
simplicity
of
worship
has
nearly
passed
away
but
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
changes
which
the
reformers
made
produced
the
deepest
impression
on
the
people
in
a
fervent
and
religious
age
the
psalms
and
hymns
of
the
reformers
were
composed
in
times
of
great
religious
excitement
calvin
was
far
behind
luther
who
did
not
separate
the
art
of
music
from
religion
but
calvin
made
a
divorce
of
art
from
public
worship
indeed
the
reformation
was
not
favorable
to
art
in
any
form
except
in
sacred
poetry
it
declared
those
truths
which
save
the
soul
rather
than
sought
those
arts
which
adorn
civilization
hence
its
churches
were
barren
of
ornaments
and
symbols
and
were
cold
and
repulsive
when
the
people
were
not
excited
by
religious
truths
nor
did
they
favor
eloquence
in
the
ordinary
meaning
of
that
word
pulpit
eloquence
was
simple
direct
and
without
rhetorical
devices
seeking
effect
not
in
gestures
and
postures
and
modulated
voice
but
earnest
appeals
to
the
heart
and
conscience
the
great
catholic
preachers
of
the
eighteenth
century
like
bossuet
and
bourdaloue
and
massillon
surpassed
the
protestants
as
rhetoricians
the
simplicity
which
marked
the
worship
of
god
as
established
by
calvin
was
also
a
feature
in
his
system
of
church
government
he
dispensed
with
bishops
archdeacons
deans
and
the
like
in
his
eyes
every
man
who
preached
the
word
was
a
presbyter
or
elder
and
every
presbyter
was
a
bishop
a
deacon
was
an
officer
to
take
care
of
the
poor
not
to
preach
and
it
was
necessary
that
a
minister
should
have
a
double
call
both
an
inward
call
and
an
outward
one
or
an
election
by
the
people
in
union
with
the
clergy
paul
and
barnabas
set
forth
elders
but
the
people
indicated
their
approval
by
lifting
up
their
hands
in
the
presbyterianism
which
calvin
instituted
he
maintained
that
the
church
is
represented
by
the
laity
as
well
as
by
the
clergy
he
therefore
gave
the
right
of
excommunication
to
the
congregation
in
conjunction
with
the
clergy
in
the
lutheran
church
as
in
the
catholic
the
right
of
excommunication
was
vested
in
the
clergy
alone
but
calvin
gave
to
the
clergy
alone
the
right
to
administer
the
sacraments
nor
would
he
give
to
the
church
any
other
power
of
punishment
than
exclusion
from
the
lord
supper
and
excommunication
his
organization
of
the
church
was
aristocratic
placing
the
power
in
the
hands
of
a
few
men
of
approved
wisdom
and
piety
he
had
no
sympathy
with
democracy
either
civil
or
religious
and
he
formed
a
close
union
between
church
and
state
giving
to
the
council
the
right
to
choose
elders
and
to
confirm
the
election
of
ministers
as
already
stated
he
did
not
attempt
to
shield
the
clergy
from
the
civil
tribunals
the
consistory
which
assembled
once
a
week
was
formed
of
elders
and
preachers
and
a
messenger
of
the
civil
court
summoned
before
it
the
persons
whose
presence
was
required
no
such
power
as
this
would
be
tolerated
in
these
times
but
the
consistory
could
not
itself
inflict
punishment
that
was
the
province
of
the
civil
government
the
elders
and
clergy
inflicted
no
civil
penalties
but
simply
determined
what
should
be
heard
before
the
spiritual
and
what
before
the
civil
tribunal
a
syndic
presided
in
the
spiritual
assembly
at
first
but
only
as
a
church
elder
the
elders
were
chosen
from
the
council
and
the
election
was
confirmed
by
the
great
council
the
people
and
preachers
so
that
the
church
was
really
in
the
hands
of
the
state
which
appointed
the
clergy
it
would
thus
seem
that
church
and
state
were
very
much
mixed
up
together
by
calvin
who
legislated
in
view
of
the
circumstances
which
surrounded
him
and
not
for
other
times
or
nations
this
subordination
of
the
church
to
the
state
which
was
maintained
by
all
the
reformers
was
established
in
opposition
to
the
custom
of
the
catholic
church
which
sought
to
make
the
state
subservient
to
the
church
and
the
lay
government
of
the
church
which
entered
into
the
system
of
calvin
was
owing
to
the
fear
that
the
clergy
when
able
to
stand
alone
might
become
proud
and
ambitious
a
fear
which
was
grounded
on
the
whole
history
of
the
church
although
calvin
had
an
exalted
idea
of
the
spiritual
dignity
of
the
church
he
allowed
a
very
dangerous
interference
of
the
state
in
ecclesiastical
affairs
even
while
he
would
separate
the
functions
of
the
clergy
from
those
of
the
magistrates
he
allowed
the
state
to
pronounce
the
final
sentence
on
dogmatic
questions
and
hence
the
power
of
the
synod
failed
in
geneva
moreover
the
payment
of
ministers
by
the
state
rather
than
by
the
people
as
in
this
country
was
against
the
old
jewish
custom
which
calvin
so
often
borrowed
for
the
priests
among
the
jews
were
independent
of
the
kings
but
calvin
wished
to
destroy
caste
among
the
clergy
and
consequently
spiritual
tyranny
in
his
legislation
we
see
an
intense
hostility
to
the
roman
catholic
church
one
of
the
animating
principles
of
the
reformers
and
hence
the
reformers
in
their
hostility
to
rome
went
from
sylla
into
charybdis
calvin
like
all
churchmen
exalted
naturally
the
theocratic
idea
of
the
old
jewish
and
mediaeval
church
and
yet
practically
put
the
church
into
the
hands
of
laymen
in
one
sense
he
was
a
spiritual
dictator
and
like
luther
a
sort
of
protestant
pope
and
yet
he
built
up
a
system
which
was
fatal
to
spiritual
power
such
as
had
existed
among
the
catholic
priesthood
for
their
sacerdotal
spiritual
power
he
would
substitute
a
moral
power
the
result
of
personal
bearing
and
sanctity
it
is
amusing
to
hear
some
people
speak
of
calvin
as
a
ghostly
spiritual
father
but
no
man
ever
fought
sacerdotalism
more
earnestly
than
he
the
logical
sequence
of
his
ecclesiastical
reforms
was
not
the
aristocratic
and
erastian
church
of
scotland
but
the
puritans
in
new
england
who
were
independents
and
not
presbyterians
yet
there
is
an
inconsistency
even
in
calvin
régime
for
he
had
the
zeal
of
the
old
catholic
church
in
giving
over
to
the
civil
power
those
he
wished
to
punish
as
in
the
case
of
servetus
he
even
intruded
into
the
circle
of
social
life
and
established
a
temporal
rather
than
a
spiritual
theocracy
and
while
he
overthrew
the
episcopal
element
he
made
a
distinction
not
recognized
in
the
primitive
church
between
clergy
and
laity
as
for
religious
toleration
it
did
not
exist
in
any
country
or
in
any
church
there
was
no
such
thing
as
true
evangelical
freedom
all
the
reformers
attempted
as
well
as
the
catholics
a
compulsory
unity
of
faith
and
this
is
an
impossibility
the
reformers
adopted
a
catechism
or
a
theological
system
which
all
communicants
were
required
to
learn
and
accept
this
is
substantially
the
acceptance
of
what
the
church
ordains
creeds
are
perhaps
a
necessity
in
ecclesiastical
bodies
and
are
not
unreasonable
but
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that
they
are
formulated
doctrines
made
by
men
on
what
is
supposed
to
be
the
meaning
of
the
scriptures
and
are
not
consistent
with
the
right
of
private
judgment
when
pushed
out
to
its
ultimate
logical
consequence
when
we
remember
how
few
men
are
capable
of
interpreting
scripture
for
themselves
and
how
few
are
disposed
to
exercise
this
right
we
can
see
why
the
formulated
catechism
proved
useful
in
securing
unity
of
belief
but
when
protestant
divines
insisted
on
the
acceptance
of
the
articles
of
faith
which
they
deduced
from
the
scriptures
they
did
not
differ
materially
from
the
catholic
clergy
in
persisting
on
the
acceptance
of
the
authority
of
the
church
as
to
matters
of
doctrine
probably
a
church
organization
is
impossible
without
a
formulated
creed
such
a
creed
has
existed
from
the
time
of
the
council
of
nice
and
is
not
likely
ever
to
be
abandoned
by
any
christian
church
in
any
future
age
although
it
may
be
modified
and
softened
with
the
advance
of
knowledge
however
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
of
the
unity
of
the
church
as
to
faith
without
a
creed
made
obligatory
on
all
the
members
of
a
communion
to
accept
and
it
always
has
been
regarded
as
a
useful
and
even
necessary
form
of
christian
instruction
for
the
people
calvin
himself
attached
great
importance
to
catechisms
and
prepared
one
even
for
children
he
also
put
a
great
value
on
preaching
instead
of
the
complicated
and
imposing
ritual
of
the
catholic
service
and
in
most
protestant
churches
from
his
day
to
ours
preaching
or
religious
instruction
has
occupied
the
most
prominent
part
of
the
church
service
and
it
must
be
conceded
that
while
the
catholic
service
has
often
degenerated
into
mere
rites
and
ceremonies
to
aid
a
devotional
spirit
so
the
protestant
service
has
often
become
cold
and
rationalistic
and
it
is
not
easy
to
say
which
extreme
is
the
worse
thus
far
we
have
viewed
calvin
in
the
light
of
a
reformer
and
legislator
but
his
influence
as
a
theologian
is
more
remarkable
it
is
for
his
theology
that
he
stands
out
as
a
prominent
figure
in
the
history
of
the
church
as
such
he
showed
greater
genius
as
such
he
is
the
most
eminent
of
all
the
reformers
as
such
he
impressed
his
mind
on
the
thinking
of
his
own
age
and
of
succeeding
ages
an
original
and
immortal
man
his
system
of
divinity
embodied
in
his
institutes
is
remarkable
for
the
radiation
of
the
general
doctrines
of
the
church
around
one
central
principle
which
he
defended
with
marvellous
logical
power
he
was
not
a
fencer
like
abélard
displaying
wonderful
dexterity
in
the
use
of
sophistries
overwhelming
adversaries
by
wit
and
sarcasm
arrogant
and
and
destroying
rather
than
building
up
he
did
not
deify
the
reason
like
erigina
nor
throw
himself
on
authority
like
bernard
he
was
not
comprehensive
like
augustine
nor
mystical
like
bonaventura
he
had
the
spiritual
insight
of
anselm
and
the
dialectical
acumen
of
thomas
aquinas
acknowledging
no
master
but
christ
and
implicitly
receiving
whatever
the
scriptures
declared
he
takes
his
original
position
neither
from
natural
reason
nor
from
the
authority
of
the
church
but
from
the
word
of
god
and
from
declarations
of
scripture
as
he
interprets
them
he
draws
sequences
and
conclusions
with
irresistible
logic
in
an
important
sense
he
is
since
he
does
not
take
cognizance
of
other
truths
equally
important
he
is
perfectly
fearless
in
pushing
out
to
its
most
logical
consequences
whatever
truth
he
seizes
upon
and
hence
he
appears
to
many
gifted
and
learned
critics
to
draw
conclusions
from
accepted
premises
which
apparently
conflict
with
consciousness
or
natural
reason
and
hence
there
has
ever
been
repugnance
to
many
of
his
doctrines
because
it
is
impossible
it
is
said
to
believe
them
in
general
calvin
does
not
essentially
differ
from
the
received
doctrines
of
the
church
as
defended
by
its
greatest
lights
in
all
ages
his
peculiarity
is
not
in
making
a
digest
of
divinity
although
he
treated
all
the
great
subjects
which
have
been
discussed
from
athanasius
to
aquinas
his
institutes
may
well
be
called
an
exhaustive
system
of
theology
there
is
no
great
doctrine
which
he
has
not
presented
with
singular
clearness
and
logical
force
yet
it
is
not
for
a
general
system
of
divinity
that
he
is
famous
but
for
making
prominent
a
certain
class
of
subjects
among
which
he
threw
the
whole
force
of
his
genius
in
fact
all
the
great
lights
of
the
church
have
been
distinguished
for
the
discussion
of
particular
doctrines
to
meet
the
exigencies
of
their
times
thus
athanasius
is
identified
with
the
trinitarian
controversy
although
he
was
a
minister
of
theological
knowledge
in
general
augustine
directed
his
attention
more
particularly
to
the
refutation
of
pelagian
heresies
and
human
depravity
luther
great
doctrine
was
justification
by
faith
although
he
took
the
same
ground
as
augustine
it
was
the
logical
result
of
the
doctrines
of
grace
which
he
defended
which
led
to
the
overthrow
in
half
of
europe
of
that
extensive
system
of
penance
and
which
marked
the
roman
catholic
church
and
on
which
so
many
glaring
abuses
were
based
as
athanasius
rendered
a
great
service
to
the
church
by
establishing
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
and
augustine
a
still
greater
service
by
the
overthrow
of
pelagianism
so
luther
undermined
the
papal
pile
of
superstition
by
showing
eloquently
what
indeed
had
been
shown
before
the
true
ground
of
justification
when
we
speak
of
calvin
the
great
subject
of
predestination
arises
before
our
minds
although
on
this
subject
he
made
no
pretention
to
originality
nor
did
he
differ
materially
from
augustine
or
gottschalk
or
thomas
aquinas
before
him
or
pascal
and
edwards
after
him
but
no
man
ever
presented
this
complicated
and
mysterious
subject
so
ably
as
he
it
is
not
for
me
to
discuss
this
great
topic
i
simply
wish
to
present
the
subject
historically
to
give
calvin
own
views
and
the
effect
of
his
deductions
on
the
theology
of
his
age
and
in
giving
calvin
views
i
must
shelter
myself
under
the
wings
of
his
best
biographer
doctor
henry
of
berlin
and
quote
the
substance
of
his
exposition
of
the
peculiar
doctrines
of
the
swiss
or
rather
french
theologian
according
to
henry
calvin
maintained
that
god
in
his
sovereign
will
and
for
his
own
glory
elected
one
part
of
the
human
race
to
everlasting
life
and
abandoned
the
other
part
to
everlasting
death
that
man
by
the
original
transgression
lost
the
power
of
except
to
do
evil
that
it
is
only
by
divine
grace
that
freedom
to
do
good
is
recovered
but
that
this
grace
is
bestowed
only
on
the
elect
and
elect
not
in
consequence
of
the
foreknowledge
of
god
but
by
his
absolute
decree
before
the
world
was
made
this
is
the
substance
of
those
peculiar
doctrines
which
are
called
calvinism
and
by
many
regarded
as
fundamental
principles
of
theology
to
be
received
with
the
same
unhesitating
faith
as
the
declarations
of
scripture
from
which
those
doctrines
are
deduced
augustine
and
aquinas
accepted
substantially
the
same
doctrines
but
they
were
not
made
so
prominent
in
their
systems
nor
were
they
so
elaborately
worked
out
the
opponents
of
calvin
including
some
of
the
brightest
lights
which
have
shone
in
the
english
church
such
men
as
jeremy
taylor
archbishop
whately
and
professor
mosley
affirm
that
these
doctrines
are
not
only
opposed
to
but
represent
god
as
arbitrarily
dooming
a
large
part
of
the
human
race
to
future
and
endless
punishment
withholding
from
them
his
grace
by
which
alone
they
can
turn
from
their
sins
creating
them
only
to
destroy
them
not
as
the
potter
moulds
the
clay
for
vessels
of
honor
and
dishonor
but
moulding
the
clay
in
order
to
destroy
the
vessels
he
has
made
whether
good
or
bad
which
doctrine
they
affirm
conflicts
with
the
views
usually
held
out
in
the
scriptures
of
god
as
a
god
of
love
and
also
conflicts
with
all
natural
justice
and
is
therefore
and
narrow
the
premises
from
which
this
doctrine
is
deduced
are
those
scripture
texts
which
have
the
authority
of
the
apostle
paul
such
as
these
according
as
he
hath
chosen
us
in
him
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
for
whom
he
did
foreknow
he
also
did
predestinate
jacob
have
i
loved
and
esau
have
i
hated
he
hath
mercy
on
whom
he
will
have
mercy
and
whom
he
will
he
hardeneth
hath
not
the
potter
power
over
his
clay
no
one
denies
that
from
these
texts
the
predestination
of
calvin
as
well
as
augustine
for
they
both
had
similar
views
is
logically
drawn
it
has
been
objected
that
both
of
these
eminent
theologians
overlooked
other
truths
which
go
in
parallel
lines
and
which
would
modify
the
doctrine
even
as
scripture
asserts
in
one
place
the
great
fact
that
the
will
is
free
and
in
another
place
that
the
will
is
shackled
the
pelagian
would
push
out
the
doctrine
of
so
as
to
ignore
the
necessity
of
grace
and
the
augustinian
would
push
out
the
doctrine
of
the
servitude
of
the
will
into
downright
fatalism
but
these
great
logicians
apparently
shrink
from
the
conclusions
to
which
their
logic
leads
them
both
augustine
and
calvin
protest
against
fatalism
and
both
assert
that
the
will
is
so
far
free
that
the
sinner
acts
without
constraint
and
consequently
the
blame
of
his
sins
rests
upon
himself
and
not
upon
another
the
doctrines
of
calvin
and
augustine
logically
pursued
would
lead
to
the
damnation
of
infants
yet
as
a
matter
of
fact
neither
maintained
that
to
which
their
logic
led
it
is
not
in
human
nature
to
believe
such
a
thing
even
if
it
may
be
dogmatically
asserted
and
then
in
regard
to
sin
no
one
has
ever
disputed
the
fact
that
sin
is
rampant
in
this
world
and
is
deserving
of
punishment
but
theologians
of
the
school
of
augustine
and
calvin
in
view
of
the
fact
have
assumed
the
premise
which
indeed
can
not
be
disputed
that
sin
is
against
an
infinite
god
hence
that
sin
against
an
infinite
god
is
itself
infinite
and
hence
that
as
sin
deserves
punishment
an
infinite
sin
deserves
infinite
punishment
a
conclusion
from
which
consciousness
recoils
and
which
is
nowhere
asserted
in
the
bible
it
is
a
conclusion
arrived
at
by
metaphysical
reasoning
which
has
very
little
to
do
with
practical
christianity
and
which
imposed
as
a
dogma
of
belief
to
be
accepted
like
plain
declarations
of
scripture
is
an
insult
to
the
human
understanding
but
this
conclusion
involving
the
belief
that
inherited
sin
and
deserving
of
infinite
punishment
appals
the
mind
for
relief
from
this
terrible
logic
the
theologian
adduces
the
great
fact
that
christ
made
an
atonement
for
sin
another
cardinal
declaration
of
the
scripture
and
that
believers
in
this
atonement
shall
be
saved
this
bible
doctrine
is
exceedingly
comforting
and
accounts
in
a
measure
for
the
marvellous
spread
of
christianity
the
wretched
people
of
the
old
roman
world
heard
the
glad
tidings
that
christ
died
for
them
as
an
atonement
for
the
sins
of
which
they
were
conscious
and
which
had
chained
them
to
despair
but
another
class
of
theologians
deduced
from
this
premise
that
as
christ
death
was
an
infinite
atonement
for
the
sins
of
the
world
so
all
men
and
consequently
all
sinners
would
be
saved
this
was
the
ground
of
the
original
universalists
deduced
from
the
doctrines
which
augustine
and
calvin
had
formulated
but
they
overlooked
the
scripture
declaration
which
calvin
never
lost
sight
of
that
salvation
was
only
for
those
who
believed
now
inasmuch
as
a
vast
majority
of
the
human
race
including
infants
have
not
believed
it
becomes
a
logical
conclusion
that
all
who
have
not
believed
are
lost
logic
and
consciousness
then
come
into
collision
and
there
is
no
relief
but
in
consigning
these
discrepancies
to
the
realm
of
mystery
i
allude
to
these
theological
difficulties
simply
to
show
the
tyranny
to
which
the
mind
and
soul
are
subjected
whenever
theological
deductions
are
invested
with
the
same
authority
as
belongs
to
original
declarations
of
scripture
and
which
so
far
from
being
systematized
do
not
even
always
apparently
harmonize
almost
any
system
of
belief
can
be
logically
deduced
from
scripture
texts
it
should
be
the
work
of
theologians
to
harmonize
them
and
show
their
general
spirit
and
meaning
rather
than
to
draw
conclusions
from
any
particular
class
of
subjects
any
system
of
deductions
from
texts
of
scripture
which
are
offset
by
texts
of
equal
authority
but
apparently
different
meaning
is
necessarily
and
imperfect
and
therefore
narrow
that
is
exactly
the
difficulty
under
which
calvin
labored
he
seems
to
a
large
class
of
christians
of
great
ability
and
conscientiousness
to
be
narrow
and
and
is
therefore
no
authority
to
them
not
be
it
understood
in
reference
to
the
great
fundamental
doctrines
of
christianity
but
in
his
views
of
predestination
and
the
subjects
interlinked
with
it
and
it
was
the
great
error
of
attaching
so
much
importance
to
mere
metaphysical
divinity
that
led
to
such
a
revulsion
from
his
peculiar
system
in
after
times
it
was
the
great
wisdom
of
the
english
reformers
like
cranmer
to
leave
all
those
metaphysical
questions
open
as
matters
of
comparatively
little
consequence
and
fall
back
on
unquestioned
doctrines
of
primitive
faith
that
have
given
so
great
vitality
to
the
english
church
and
made
it
so
broad
and
catholic
the
puritans
as
a
body
more
intellectual
than
the
mass
of
the
episcopalians
were
led
away
by
the
imposing
and
entangling
dialectics
of
the
scholastic
calvin
and
came
unfortunately
to
attach
as
much
importance
to
such
subjects
as
and
predestination
questions
most
complicated
as
they
did
to
the
weightier
matters
of
the
law
and
when
pushed
by
the
logic
of
opponents
to
the
have
been
compelled
to
fall
back
on
the
catholic
doctrine
of
mysteries
as
something
which
could
never
be
explained
or
comprehended
but
which
it
is
a
christian
duty
to
accept
as
a
mystery
the
scriptures
certainly
speak
of
mysteries
like
regeneration
but
it
is
one
thing
to
marvel
how
a
man
can
be
born
again
by
the
spirit
of
god
a
fact
we
see
every
day
and
quite
another
thing
to
make
a
mystery
to
be
accepted
as
a
matter
of
faith
of
that
which
the
bible
has
nowhere
distinctly
affirmed
and
which
is
against
all
ideas
of
natural
justice
and
arrived
at
by
a
subtle
process
of
dialectical
reasoning
but
it
was
natural
for
so
great
an
intellectual
giant
as
calvin
to
make
his
startling
deductions
from
the
great
truths
he
meditated
upon
with
so
much
seriousness
and
earnestness
only
a
very
lofty
nature
would
have
revelled
as
he
did
and
as
augustine
did
before
him
and
pascal
after
him
in
those
great
subjects
which
pertain
to
god
and
his
dispensations
all
his
meditations
and
formulated
doctrines
radiate
from
the
great
and
sublime
idea
of
the
majesty
of
god
and
the
comparative
insignificance
of
man
and
here
he
was
not
so
far
apart
from
the
great
sages
of
antiquity
before
salvation
was
revealed
by
christ
canst
thou
by
searching
find
out
god
what
is
man
that
thou
art
mindful
of
him
and
here
i
would
remark
that
theologians
and
philosophers
have
ever
been
divided
into
two
great
schools
those
who
have
had
a
tendency
to
exalt
the
dignity
of
man
and
those
who
would
absorb
man
in
the
greatness
of
the
deity
these
two
schools
have
advocated
doctrines
which
logically
carried
out
to
their
ultimate
sequences
would
produce
a
grecian
humanitarianism
on
the
one
hand
and
a
sort
of
bramanism
on
the
other
the
one
making
man
the
arbiter
of
his
own
destiny
independently
of
divine
agency
and
the
other
making
the
deity
the
only
power
of
the
universe
with
one
school
god
as
the
only
controlling
agency
is
a
fiction
and
man
himself
is
infinite
in
faculties
the
other
holds
that
god
is
everything
and
man
is
nothing
the
distinction
between
these
two
schools
both
of
which
have
had
great
defenders
is
fundamental
such
as
that
between
augustine
and
pelagius
between
bernard
and
abélard
and
between
calvin
and
lainez
among
those
who
have
inclined
to
the
doctrine
of
the
majesty
of
god
and
the
littleness
of
man
were
the
primitive
monks
and
the
indian
theosophists
and
the
orthodox
scholastics
of
the
middle
ages
all
of
whom
were
comparatively
indifferent
to
material
pleasure
and
physical
progress
and
sought
the
salvation
of
the
soul
and
the
favor
of
god
beyond
all
temporal
blessings
of
the
other
class
have
been
the
greek
philosophers
and
the
rationalizing
schoolmen
and
the
modern
lights
of
science
now
calvin
was
imbued
with
the
lofty
spirit
of
the
fathers
of
the
church
and
the
more
religious
and
contemplative
of
the
schoolmen
and
the
saints
of
the
middle
ages
when
he
attached
but
little
dignity
to
man
unaided
by
divine
grace
and
was
absorbed
with
the
idea
of
the
sovereignty
of
god
in
whose
hands
man
is
like
clay
in
the
hands
of
the
potter
this
view
of
god
pervaded
the
whole
spirit
of
his
theology
making
it
both
lofty
and
yet
to
him
the
chief
end
of
man
was
to
glorify
god
not
to
develop
his
own
intellectual
faculties
and
still
less
to
seek
the
pleasures
and
excitements
of
the
world
man
was
a
sinner
before
an
infinite
god
and
he
could
rise
above
the
polluting
influence
of
sin
only
by
the
special
favor
of
god
and
his
divinely
communicated
grace
man
was
so
great
a
sinner
that
he
deserved
an
eternal
punishment
only
to
be
rescued
as
a
brand
plucked
from
the
fire
as
one
of
the
elect
before
the
world
was
made
the
vast
majority
of
men
were
left
to
the
uncovenanted
mercies
of
christ
the
redeemer
not
of
the
race
but
of
those
who
believed
to
calvin
therefore
as
to
the
puritans
the
belief
in
a
personal
god
was
everything
not
a
compulsory
belief
in
the
general
existence
of
a
deity
who
united
with
nature
reveals
himself
to
our
consciousness
not
the
god
of
the
pantheist
visible
in
all
the
wonders
of
nature
not
the
god
of
the
rationalist
who
retires
from
the
universe
which
he
has
made
leaving
it
to
the
operation
of
certain
unchanging
and
universal
laws
but
the
god
whom
abraham
and
moses
and
the
prophets
saw
and
recognized
and
who
by
his
special
providence
rules
the
destinies
of
men
the
most
intellectual
of
the
reformers
abhorred
the
deification
of
the
reason
and
clung
to
that
exalted
supernaturalism
which
was
the
life
and
hope
of
blessed
saints
and
martyrs
in
bygone
ages
and
which
in
their
contests
with
infidelity
was
like
the
pebble
which
the
shepherd
of
israel
hurled
against
the
disdainful
boaster
who
defied
the
power
of
israel
god
and
he
was
thus
brought
into
close
sympathy
with
the
realism
of
the
fathers
who
felt
that
all
that
is
valuable
in
theology
must
radiate
from
the
recognition
of
almighty
power
in
the
renovation
of
society
and
displayed
not
according
to
our
human
notions
of
law
and
progress
and
but
supernaturally
and
mysteriously
according
to
his
sovereign
will
which
is
above
law
since
god
is
the
author
of
law
he
simply
erred
in
enforcing
a
certain
class
of
truths
which
must
follow
from
the
majesty
of
the
one
great
first
cause
lofty
as
these
truths
are
to
the
exclusion
of
another
class
of
truths
of
great
importance
which
gives
to
his
system
incompleteness
and
thus
he
was
led
to
undervalue
the
power
of
truth
itself
in
its
contest
with
error
he
was
led
into
a
seeming
recognition
of
two
wills
in
god
that
which
wills
the
salvation
of
all
men
and
that
which
wills
the
salvation
of
the
elect
alone
he
is
accused
of
a
leaning
to
fatalism
which
he
heartily
denied
but
which
seems
to
follow
from
his
logical
conclusions
he
entered
into
an
arena
of
metaphysical
controversy
which
can
never
be
settled
the
doctrines
of
and
necessity
can
never
be
reconciled
by
mortal
reason
consciousness
reveals
the
freedom
of
the
will
as
well
as
the
slavery
to
sin
men
are
conscious
of
both
they
waste
their
time
in
attempting
to
reconcile
two
apparently
opposing
facts
like
our
pious
fathers
at
their
new
england
firesides
who
were
compelled
to
shelter
themselves
behind
mystery
the
tendency
of
calvin
system
it
is
maintained
by
many
is
to
ascribe
to
god
attributes
which
according
to
natural
justice
would
be
injustice
and
cruelty
such
as
no
father
would
exercise
on
his
own
children
however
guilty
even
good
men
will
not
accept
in
their
hearts
doctrines
which
tend
to
make
god
less
compassionate
than
man
there
are
not
two
kinds
of
justice
the
intellect
is
appalled
when
it
is
affirmed
that
one
man
suffers
the
penalty
of
another
man
sin
although
the
world
is
full
of
instances
of
men
suffering
from
the
carelessness
or
wickedness
of
others
as
in
a
wicked
war
or
an
unnecessary
railway
disaster
the
scripture
law
of
retribution
as
brought
out
in
the
bible
and
sustained
by
consciousness
is
the
penalty
a
man
pays
for
personal
and
voluntary
transgression
nor
will
consciousness
accept
the
doctrine
that
the
sin
of
a
mortal
especially
under
strong
temptation
and
with
all
the
bias
of
a
sinful
nature
is
infinite
nothing
which
a
created
mortal
can
do
is
infinite
it
is
only
finite
the
infinite
belongs
to
god
alone
hence
an
infinite
penalty
for
a
finite
sin
conflicts
with
consciousness
and
is
nowhere
asserted
in
the
bible
which
is
transcendently
more
merciful
and
comforting
than
many
theological
systems
of
belief
however
powerfully
sustained
by
dialectical
reasoning
and
by
the
most
excellent
men
human
judgments
or
reasonings
are
fallible
on
moral
questions
which
have
two
sides
and
reasonings
from
texts
which
present
different
meanings
when
studied
by
the
lights
of
learning
and
science
are
still
more
liable
to
be
untrustworthy
it
would
seem
to
be
the
supremest
necessity
for
theological
schools
to
unravel
the
meaning
of
divine
declarations
and
present
doctrines
in
their
relation
with
apparently
conflicting
texts
rather
than
draw
out
a
perfect
and
consistent
system
philosophically
considered
from
any
one
class
of
texts
of
all
things
in
this
wicked
and
perplexing
world
the
science
of
theology
should
be
the
most
cheerful
and
inspiring
for
it
involves
inquiries
on
the
loftiest
subjects
which
can
interest
a
thoughtful
mind
but
whatever
defects
the
system
of
doctrines
which
calvin
elaborated
with
such
transcendent
ability
may
have
there
is
no
question
as
to
its
vast
influence
on
the
thinking
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
the
schools
of
france
and
holland
and
scotland
and
england
and
america
were
animated
by
his
genius
and
authority
he
was
a
burning
and
a
shining
light
if
not
for
all
ages
at
least
for
the
unsettled
times
in
which
he
lived
no
theologian
ever
had
a
greater
posthumous
power
than
he
for
nearly
three
hundred
years
and
he
is
still
one
of
the
great
authorities
of
the
church
universal
john
knox
sought
his
counsel
and
was
influenced
by
his
advice
in
the
great
reform
he
made
in
scotland
in
france
the
words
calvinist
and
huguenot
are
synonymous
cranmer
too
listened
to
his
counsels
and
had
great
respect
for
his
learning
and
sanctity
among
the
puritans
he
has
reigned
like
an
oracle
oliver
cromwell
embraced
his
doctrines
as
also
did
sir
matthew
hale
ridicule
or
abuse
of
calvin
is
as
absurd
as
the
ridicule
or
abuse
with
which
protestants
so
long
assailed
hildebrand
or
innocent
iii
no
one
abuses
pascal
or
augustine
and
yet
the
theological
views
of
all
these
are
substantially
the
same
in
one
respect
i
think
that
calvin
has
received
more
credit
than
he
deserves
some
have
maintained
that
he
was
a
sort
of
father
of
republicanism
and
democratic
liberty
in
truth
he
had
no
popular
sympathies
and
leaned
towards
an
aristocracy
which
was
little
short
of
an
oligarchy
he
had
no
hand
in
establishing
the
political
system
of
geneva
it
was
established
before
he
went
there
he
was
not
even
one
of
those
thinkers
who
sympathized
with
true
liberty
of
conscience
he
persecuted
heretics
like
a
mediaeval
catholic
divine
he
would
have
burned
a
galileo
as
he
caused
the
death
of
servetus
which
need
not
have
happened
but
for
him
calvin
could
have
saved
servetus
if
he
had
pleased
but
he
complained
of
him
to
the
magistrates
knowing
that
his
condemnation
and
death
would
necessarily
follow
he
had
neither
the
humanity
of
luther
nor
the
toleration
of
saint
augustine
he
was
the
impersonation
of
intellect
like
newton
leibnitz
spinoza
and
kant
which
overbore
the
impulses
of
his
heart
he
had
no
passions
except
zeal
for
orthodoxy
so
did
intellect
tower
above
the
passions
that
he
seemed
to
lack
sympathy
and
yet
such
was
his
exalted
character
he
was
capable
of
friendship
he
was
remarkable
for
every
faculty
of
the
mind
except
wit
and
imagination
his
memory
was
almost
incredible
he
remembered
everything
he
ever
read
or
heard
he
would
after
long
intervals
recognize
persons
whom
he
had
never
seen
but
once
or
twice
when
employed
in
dictation
he
would
resume
the
thread
of
his
discourse
without
being
prompted
after
the
most
vexatious
interruptions
his
judgment
was
as
sound
as
his
memory
was
retentive
it
was
almost
infallible
no
one
was
ever
known
to
have
been
misled
by
it
he
had
a
remarkable
analytical
power
and
also
the
power
of
generalization
he
was
a
very
learned
man
and
his
commentaries
are
among
the
most
useful
and
valued
of
his
writings
showing
both
learning
and
judgment
his
exegetical
works
have
scarcely
been
improved
he
had
no
sceptical
or
rationalistic
tendencies
and
therefore
his
commentaries
may
not
be
admired
by
men
of
advanced
thought
but
his
annotations
will
live
when
those
of
ewald
shall
be
forgotten
they
still
hold
their
place
in
the
libraries
of
biblical
critics
for
his
age
he
was
a
transcendent
critic
his
various
writings
fill
five
folio
volumes
he
was
not
so
voluminous
a
writer
as
thomas
aquinas
but
less
diffuse
his
style
is
lucid
like
that
of
voltaire
considering
the
weakness
of
his
body
calvin
labors
were
prodigious
there
was
never
a
more
industrious
man
finding
time
for
everything
for
an
amazing
correspondence
for
pastoral
labors
for
treatises
and
essays
for
commentaries
and
official
duties
no
man
ever
accomplished
more
in
the
same
space
of
time
he
preached
daily
every
alternate
week
he
attended
meetings
of
the
consistory
and
of
the
court
of
morals
he
interested
himself
in
the
great
affairs
of
his
age
he
wrote
letters
to
all
parts
of
christendom
reigning
as
a
religious
dictator
and
with
more
influence
than
any
man
of
his
age
next
to
luther
calvin
was
content
to
remain
poor
and
was
disdainful
of
money
and
all
praises
and
rewards
this
was
not
an
affectation
not
the
desire
to
imitate
the
great
saints
of
christian
antiquity
to
whom
poverty
was
a
cardinal
virtue
but
real
indifference
looking
upon
money
as
as
camp
equipage
is
to
successful
generals
he
was
not
conscious
of
being
poor
with
his
small
salary
of
fifty
dollars
a
year
feeling
that
he
had
inexhaustible
riches
within
him
and
hence
he
calmly
and
naturally
took
his
seat
among
the
great
men
of
the
world
as
their
peer
and
equal
without
envy
of
the
accidents
of
fortune
and
birth
he
was
as
indifferent
to
money
and
luxuries
as
socrates
when
he
walked
barefooted
among
the
athenian
aristocracy
or
basil
when
he
retired
to
the
wilderness
he
rarely
gave
vent
to
extravagant
grief
or
joy
seldom
laughed
and
cared
little
for
hilarities
he
knew
no
games
or
sports
he
rarely
played
with
children
or
gossiped
with
women
he
loved
without
romance
and
suffered
bereavement
without
outward
sorrow
he
had
no
toleration
for
human
infirmities
and
was
neither
social
nor
genial
he
sought
a
wife
not
so
much
for
communion
of
feeling
as
to
ease
him
of
his
burdens
not
to
share
his
confidence
but
to
take
care
of
his
house
nor
was
he
fond
like
luther
of
music
and
poetry
he
had
no
taste
for
the
fine
arts
he
never
had
a
poet
or
an
artist
for
his
friend
or
companion
he
could
not
look
out
of
his
window
without
seeing
the
glaciers
of
the
alps
but
seemed
to
be
unmoved
by
their
unspeakable
grandeur
he
did
not
revel
in
the
glories
of
nature
or
art
but
gave
his
mind
to
abstract
ideas
and
stern
practical
duties
he
was
sparing
of
language
simple
direct
and
precise
using
neither
sarcasm
nor
ridicule
nor
exaggeration
he
was
far
from
being
eloquent
according
to
popular
notions
of
oratory
and
despised
the
jingle
of
words
and
phrases
and
tricks
of
rhetoric
he
appealed
to
reason
rather
than
the
passions
to
the
conscience
rather
than
the
imagination
though
mild
calvin
was
also
intolerant
castillo
once
his
friend
assailed
his
doctrine
of
decrees
and
was
obliged
to
quit
geneva
and
was
so
persecuted
that
he
died
of
actual
starvation
perrin
of
the
republic
danced
at
a
wedding
and
was
thrown
into
prison
bolsec
an
eminent
physician
opposed
the
doctrine
of
predestination
and
was
sentenced
to
perpetual
imprisonment
gruet
spoke
lightly
of
the
ordinances
of
religion
and
was
beheaded
servetus
was
a
moral
and
learned
and
honest
man
but
could
not
escape
the
flames
had
he
been
willing
to
say
as
the
flames
consumed
his
body
jesus
thou
eternal
son
of
god
have
mercy
on
me
instead
of
jesus
thou
son
of
the
eternal
god
he
might
have
been
spared
calvin
was
as
severe
on
those
who
refused
to
accept
his
logical
deductions
from
acknowledged
truths
as
he
was
on
those
who
denied
the
fundamental
truths
themselves
but
toleration
was
rare
in
his
age
and
he
was
not
beyond
it
he
was
not
even
beyond
the
ideas
of
the
middle
ages
in
some
important
points
such
as
those
which
pertained
to
divine
justice
the
wrath
rather
than
the
love
of
god
he
lived
too
near
the
middle
ages
to
be
emancipated
from
the
ideas
which
enslaved
such
a
man
as
thomas
aquinas
he
had
very
little
patience
with
frivolous
amusements
or
degrading
pursuits
he
attached
great
dignity
to
the
ministerial
office
and
set
a
severe
example
of
decorum
and
propriety
in
all
his
public
ministrations
he
was
a
type
of
the
early
evangelical
divines
and
was
the
father
of
the
old
puritan
strictness
and
narrowness
and
fidelity
to
trusts
his
very
faults
grew
out
of
virtues
pushed
to
extremes
in
our
times
such
a
man
would
not
be
selected
as
a
travelling
companion
or
a
man
at
whose
house
we
would
wish
to
keep
the
christmas
holidays
his
unattractive
austerity
perhaps
has
been
made
too
much
of
by
his
enemies
and
grew
out
of
his
unimpulsive
temperament
call
it
cold
if
we
must
and
also
out
of
his
stern
theology
which
marked
the
ascetics
of
the
middle
ages
few
would
now
approve
of
his
severity
of
discipline
any
more
than
they
would
feel
inclined
to
accept
some
of
his
theological
deductions
i
question
whether
calvin
lived
in
the
hearts
of
his
countrymen
or
they
would
have
erected
some
monument
to
his
memory
in
our
times
a
statue
has
been
erected
to
rousseau
in
geneva
but
calvin
was
buried
without
ceremony
and
with
exceeding
simplicity
he
was
a
warrior
who
cared
nothing
for
glory
or
honor
absorbed
in
devotion
to
his
invisible
king
not
indifferent
to
the
exercise
of
power
but
only
as
he
felt
he
was
the
delegated
messenger
of
divine
omnipotence
scattering
to
the
winds
the
dust
of
all
mortal
grandeur
with
all
his
faults
which
were
on
the
surface
he
was
the
accepted
idol
and
oracle
of
a
great
party
and
stamped
his
genius
on
his
own
and
succeeding
ages
whatever
the
presbyterians
have
done
for
civilization
he
comes
in
for
a
share
of
the
honor
whatever
foundations
the
puritans
laid
for
national
greatness
in
this
country
it
must
be
confessed
that
they
caught
inspiration
from
his
decrees
such
a
great
master
of
exegetical
learning
and
theological
inquiry
and
legislative
wisdom
will
be
forever
held
in
reverence
by
lofty
characters
although
he
may
be
no
favorite
with
the
mass
of
mankind
if
many
great
men
and
good
men
have
failed
to
comprehend
either
his
character
or
his
system
how
can
a
and
material
generation
seeking
to
combine
the
glories
of
this
world
with
the
promises
of
the
next
see
much
in
him
to
admire
except
as
a
great
intellectual
dialectician
and
in
an
age
with
which
it
has
no
sympathy
how
can
it
appreciate
his
deep
spiritual
life
his
profound
communion
with
god
his
burning
zeal
for
the
defence
of
christian
doctrine
his
sublime
his
holy
resignation
his
entire
consecration
to
a
great
cause
nobody
can
do
justice
to
calvin
who
does
not
know
the
history
of
his
times
the
circumstances
which
surrounded
him
and
the
enemies
he
was
required
to
fight
no
one
can
comprehend
his
character
or
mission
who
does
not
feel
it
to
be
supremely
necessary
to
have
a
definite
positive
system
of
religious
belief
based
on
the
authority
of
the
scriptures
as
a
divine
inspiration
both
as
an
anchor
amid
the
storms
and
a
star
of
promise
and
hope
and
after
all
what
is
the
head
and
front
of
calvin
offending
that
he
was
cold
unsocial
and
ungenial
in
character
and
that
as
a
theologian
he
fearlessly
and
inexorably
pushed
out
his
deductions
to
their
remotest
logical
sequences
but
he
was
no
more
austere
than
chrysostom
no
more
ascetic
than
basil
not
even
sterner
in
character
than
michael
angelo
or
more
unsocial
than
pascal
or
cromwell
or
william
the
silent
we
lose
sight
of
his
defects
in
the
greatness
of
his
services
and
the
exalted
dignity
of
his
character
if
he
was
severe
to
adversaries
he
was
kind
to
friends
and
when
his
feeble
body
was
worn
out
by
his
protracted
labors
at
the
age
of
and
he
felt
that
the
hand
of
death
was
upon
him
he
called
together
his
friends
and
in
reform
the
magistrates
and
ministers
of
geneva
imparted
his
last
lessons
and
expressed
his
last
wishes
with
the
placidity
of
a
christian
sage
amid
tears
and
sobs
and
stifled
groans
he
discoursed
calmly
on
his
approaching
departure
gave
his
affectionate
benedictions
and
commended
them
and
his
cause
to
christ
lingering
longer
than
was
expected
but
dying
in
the
highest
triumphs
of
christian
faith
may
in
the
arms
of
his
faithful
and
admiring
beza
as
the
rays
of
the
gilded
with
their
glory
his
humble
chamber
of
toil
and
spiritual
exaltation
no
man
who
knows
anything
will
ever
sneer
at
calvin
he
is
not
to
be
measured
by
common
standards
he
was
universally
regarded
as
the
greatest
light
of
the
theological
world
when
we
remember
his
transcendent
abilities
his
matchless
labors
his
unrivalled
influence
his
unblemished
morality
his
lofty
piety
and
soaring
soul
all
flippant
criticism
is
contemptible
and
mean
he
ranks
with
immortal
benefactors
and
needs
least
of
all
any
apologies
for
his
defects
a
man
who
stamped
his
opinions
on
his
own
age
and
succeeding
ages
can
be
regarded
only
as
a
very
extraordinary
genius
a
frivolous
and
generation
may
not
be
attracted
by
such
an
impersonation
of
cold
intellect
and
may
rear
no
costly
monument
to
his
memory
but
his
work
remains
as
the
leader
of
the
loftiest
class
of
christian
enthusiasts
that
the
modern
world
has
known
and
the
founder
of
a
theological
system
which
still
numbers
in
spite
of
all
the
changes
of
human
thought
some
of
the
greatest
thinkers
and
ablest
expounders
of
christian
doctrine
in
both
europe
and
america
to
have
been
the
spiritual
father
of
the
puritans
for
three
hundred
years
is
itself
a
great
evidence
of
moral
and
intellectual
excellence
and
will
link
his
name
with
some
of
the
greatest
movements
that
have
marked
our
modern
civilization
from
plymouth
rock
to
the
shores
of
the
pacific
ocean
we
still
see
the
traces
of
his
marvellous
genius
and
his
still
more
wonderful
influence
on
the
minds
of
men
and
on
the
schools
of
christian
theology
so
that
he
will
ever
be
regarded
as
the
great
doctor
of
the
protestant
church
authorities

keeping
him
in
that
niche
of
the
temple
of
fame
where
the
poet
has
placed
him
contemptible
as
a
man
but
venerable
as
the
philosopher
radiant
with
all
the
wisdom
of
his
age
and
of
all
preceding
ages
the
miner
and
sapper
of
ancient
falsehoods
the
pioneer
of
all
true
knowledge
the
author
of
that
inductive
and
experimental
philosophy
on
which
is
based
the
glory
of
our
age
macaulay
especially
in
that
long
and
brilliant
article
which
appeared
in
the
edinburgh
review
in
has
represented
him
as
a
remarkably
worldly
man
cold
calculating
selfish
a
sycophant
and
a
flatterer
bent
on
greedy
careless
false
climbing
to
power
by
base
subserviency
betraying
friends
and
courting
enemies
with
no
animosities
he
does
not
suppress
from
policy
and
with
no
affections
which
he
openly
manifests
when
it
does
not
suit
his
interests
so
that
we
read
with
shame
of
his
extraordinary
shamelessness
from
the
time
he
first
felt
the
cravings
of
a
vulgar
ambition
to
the
consummation
of
a
disgraceful
crime
from
the
base
desertion
of
his
greatest
benefactor
to
the
public
selling
of
justice
as
lord
high
chancellor
of
the
realm
resorting
to
all
the
arts
of
a
courtier
to
win
the
favor
of
his
sovereign
and
of
his
minions
and
favorites
reckless
as
to
honest
debts
torturing
on
the
rack
an
honest
parson
for
a
sermon
he
never
preached
and
when
obliged
to
confess
his
corruption
meanly
supplicating
mercy
from
the
nation
he
had
outraged
and
favors
from
the
monarch
whose
cause
he
had
betrayed
the
defects
and
delinquencies
of
this
great
man
are
bluntly
and
harshly
put
by
macaulay
without
any
attempt
to
soften
or
palliate
them
as
if
he
would
consign
his
name
and
memory
not
to
men
charitable
speeches
to
foreign
nations
and
to
the
next
ages
but
to
an
infamy
as
lasting
and
deep
as
that
of
scroggs
and
of
jeffreys
or
any
of
those
hideous
tyrants
and
monsters
that
disgraced
the
reigns
of
the
stuart
kings
and
yet
while
the
man
is
made
to
appear
in
such
hideous
colors
his
philosophy
is
exalted
to
the
highest
pinnacle
of
praise
as
the
greatest
boon
which
any
philosopher
ever
rendered
to
the
world
and
the
chief
cause
of
all
subsequent
progress
in
scientific
discovery
and
thus
in
brilliant
rhetoric
we
have
a
painting
of
a
man
whose
life
was
in
striking
contrast
with
his
teachings
a
judas
iscariot
uttering
divine
philosophy
a
seneca
accumulating
millions
as
the
tool
of
nero
a
fallen
angel
pointing
with
rapture
to
the
realms
of
eternal
light
we
have
the
most
startling
contradiction
in
all
history
glory
in
debasement
and
debasement
in
glory
the
most
selfish
and
worldly
man
in
england
the
meanest
of
mankind
conferring
on
the
race
one
of
the
greatest
blessings
it
ever
received
not
accidentally
not
in
repentance
and
shame
but
in
exalted
and
persistent
labors
amid
public
cares
and
physical
infirmities
from
youth
to
advanced
old
age
living
in
the
highest
regions
of
thought
studious
and
patient
all
his
days
even
when
neglected
and
unrewarded
for
the
transcendent
services
he
rendered
not
as
a
philosopher
merely
but
as
a
man
of
affairs
and
as
a
responsible
officer
of
the
crown
has
there
ever
been
before
or
since
such
an
anomaly
in
human
history
so
infamous
in
action
so
glorious
in
thought
such
a
contradiction
between
life
and
teachings
so
that
many
are
found
to
utter
indignant
protests
against
such
a
representation
of
humanity
justly
feeling
that
such
a
portrait
however
much
it
may
be
admired
for
its
brilliant
colors
and
however
difficult
to
be
proved
false
is
nevertheless
an
insult
to
the
human
understanding
the
heart
of
the
world
will
not
accept
the
strange
and
singular
belief
that
so
bad
a
man
could
confer
so
great
a
boon
especially
when
he
seemed
bent
on
bestowing
it
during
his
whole
life
amid
the
most
harassing
duties
if
it
accepts
the
boon
it
will
strive
to
do
justice
to
the
benefactor
as
he
himself
appealed
to
future
ages
and
if
it
can
not
deny
the
charges
which
have
been
arrayed
against
him
especially
if
it
can
not
exculpate
him
it
will
soar
beyond
technical
proofs
to
take
into
consideration
the
circumstances
of
the
times
the
temptations
of
a
corrupt
age
and
the
splendid
traits
which
can
with
equal
authority
be
adduced
to
set
off
against
the
mistakes
and
faults
which
proceeded
from
inadvertence
and
weakness
rather
than
a
debased
moral
sense
even
as
the
defects
and
weaknesses
of
cicero
are
lost
sight
of
in
the
acknowledged
virtues
of
his
ordinary
life
and
the
honest
and
noble
services
he
rendered
to
his
country
and
mankind
bacon
was
a
favored
man
he
belonged
to
the
upper
ranks
of
society
his
father
sir
nicholas
bacon
was
a
great
lawyer
and
reached
the
highest
dignities
being
lord
keeper
of
the
great
seal
his
mother
sister
was
the
wife
of
william
cecil
the
great
lord
burleigh
the
most
able
and
influential
of
queen
elizabeth
ministers
francis
bacon
was
the
youngest
son
of
the
lord
keeper
and
was
born
in
london
he
had
a
sickly
and
feeble
constitution
but
intellectually
was
a
youthful
prodigy
and
at
nine
years
of
age
by
his
gravity
and
knowledge
attracted
the
admiring
attention
of
the
queen
who
called
him
her
young
lord
keeper
at
the
age
of
ten
we
find
him
stealing
away
from
his
companions
to
discover
the
cause
of
a
singular
echo
in
the
brick
conduit
near
his
father
house
in
the
strand
at
twelve
he
entered
the
university
of
cambridge
at
fifteen
he
quitted
it
already
disgusted
with
its
pedantries
and
sophistries
at
sixteen
he
rebelled
against
the
authority
of
aristotle
and
took
up
his
residence
at
gray
inn
the
same
year
he
was
sent
to
paris
in
the
suite
of
sir
amias
paulet
ambassador
to
the
court
of
france
and
delighted
the
salons
of
the
capital
by
his
wit
and
profound
inquiries
at
nineteen
he
returned
to
england
having
won
golden
opinions
from
the
doctors
of
the
french
sanhedrim
who
saw
in
him
a
second
daniel
and
in
he
was
admitted
as
a
barrister
of
gray
inn
and
the
following
year
composed
an
essay
on
the
instauration
of
philosophy
thus
at
an
age
when
young
men
now
leave
the
university
he
had
attacked
the
existing
systems
of
science
and
philosophy
proudly
taking
in
all
science
and
knowledge
for
his
realm
about
this
time
his
father
died
without
leaving
him
a
younger
son
a
competence
nor
would
his
great
relatives
give
him
an
office
or
sinecure
by
which
he
might
be
supported
while
he
sought
truth
and
he
was
forced
to
plod
at
the
law
which
he
never
liked
resisting
the
blandishments
and
follies
by
which
he
was
surrounded
and
at
intervals
when
other
young
men
of
his
age
and
rank
were
seeking
pleasure
he
was
studying
nature
science
history
philosophy
poetry
everything
even
the
whole
domain
of
truth
and
with
such
success
that
his
varied
attainments
were
rather
a
hindrance
to
an
appreciation
of
his
merits
as
a
lawyer
and
his
preferment
in
his
profession
in
he
entered
parliament
sitting
for
taunton
and
also
became
a
bencher
at
gray
inn
so
that
at
he
was
in
full
practice
in
the
courts
of
westminster
also
a
politician
speaking
on
almost
every
question
of
importance
which
agitated
the
house
of
commons
for
twenty
years
distinguished
for
eloquence
as
well
as
learning
and
for
a
manly
independence
which
did
not
entirely
please
the
queen
from
whom
all
honors
came
in
at
the
age
of
he
formed
the
acquaintance
of
essex
about
his
own
age
who
as
the
favorite
of
the
queen
was
regarded
as
the
most
influential
man
in
the
country
the
acquaintance
ripened
into
friendship
and
to
the
solicitation
of
this
powerful
patron
who
urged
the
queen
to
give
bacon
a
high
office
she
is
said
to
have
replied
he
has
indeed
great
wit
and
much
learning
but
in
law
my
lord
he
is
not
deeply
read
an
opinion
perhaps
put
into
her
head
by
his
rival
coke
who
did
indeed
know
law
but
scarcely
anything
else
or
by
that
class
of
functionaries
who
could
not
conceive
how
a
man
could
master
more
than
one
thing
we
should
however
remember
that
bacon
had
not
reached
the
age
when
great
offices
were
usually
conferred
in
the
professions
and
that
his
efforts
to
be
made
at
the
age
of
and
even
earlier
would
now
seem
unreasonable
and
importunate
whatever
might
be
his
attainments
disappointed
in
not
receiving
high
office
he
meditated
a
retreat
to
cambridge
but
his
friend
essex
gave
him
a
villa
in
twickenham
which
he
soon
mortgaged
for
he
was
in
debt
all
his
life
although
in
receipt
of
sums
which
would
have
supported
him
in
comfort
and
dignity
were
it
not
for
his
habits
of
extravagance
the
greatest
flaw
in
his
character
and
which
was
the
indirect
cause
of
his
disgrace
and
fall
he
was
even
arrested
for
debt
when
he
enjoyed
a
lucrative
practice
at
the
courts
but
nothing
prevented
him
from
pursuing
his
literary
and
scientific
studies
amid
great
distractions
for
he
was
both
a
leader
at
the
bar
and
a
leader
of
the
house
of
commons
and
if
he
did
not
receive
the
rewards
to
which
he
felt
entitled
he
was
always
consulted
by
elizabeth
in
great
legal
difficulties
it
was
not
until
the
queen
died
and
bacon
was
years
old
that
he
became
in
the
fourth
year
of
the
reign
of
james
one
year
after
his
marriage
with
alice
barnham
an
daughter
a
handsome
maiden
and
to
his
liking
besides
this
office
which
brought
him
a
year
he
about
this
time
had
a
windfall
as
clerk
of
the
star
chamber
which
added
to
his
income
at
that
time
from
all
sources
about
a
year
a
very
large
sum
for
those
times
and
making
him
really
a
rich
man
six
years
afterward
he
was
made
and
in
the
year
he
was
made
lord
keeper
and
the
following
year
he
was
raised
to
the
highest
position
in
the
realm
next
to
that
of
archbishop
of
canterbury
as
lord
chancellor
at
the
age
of
and
soon
after
was
created
lord
verulam
that
is
his
title
but
the
world
persists
in
calling
him
lord
bacon
in
two
years
after
the
execution
of
sir
walter
raleigh
which
bacon
advised
he
was
in
the
zenith
of
his
fortunes
and
fame
having
been
lately
created
viscount
albans
and
having
published
the
novum
organum
the
first
instalment
of
the
instauratio
magna
at
which
he
had
been
working
the
best
part
of
his
life
some
thirty
years
a
new
logic
to
judge
or
invent
by
induction
and
thereby
to
make
philosophy
and
science
both
more
true
and
more
active
then
began
to
gather
the
storms
which
were
to
wreck
his
fortunes
the
nation
now
was
clamorous
for
reform
and
coke
the
enemy
of
bacon
who
was
then
the
leader
of
the
reform
party
in
the
house
of
commons
stimulated
the
movement
the
house
began
its
scrutiny
with
the
administration
of
justice
and
bacon
could
not
stand
before
it
for
as
the
highest
judge
in
england
he
was
accused
of
taking
bribes
before
rendering
decisions
and
of
many
cases
of
corruption
so
glaring
that
no
defence
was
undertaken
and
the
house
of
lords
had
no
alternative
but
to
sentence
him
to
the
tower
and
fine
him
to
degrade
him
from
his
office
and
banish
him
from
the
precincts
of
the
court
a
fall
so
great
and
the
impression
of
it
on
the
civilized
world
so
tremendous
that
the
case
of
a
judge
accepting
bribes
has
rarely
since
been
known
bacon
was
imprisoned
but
a
few
days
his
ruinous
fine
of
was
remitted
and
he
was
even
soon
after
received
at
court
but
he
never
again
held
office
he
was
hopelessly
disgraced
he
was
a
ruined
man
and
he
bitterly
felt
the
humiliation
and
acknowledged
the
justice
of
his
punishment
he
had
now
no
further
object
in
life
than
to
pursue
his
studies
and
live
comfortably
in
his
retirement
and
do
what
he
could
for
future
ages
but
before
we
consider
his
immortal
legacy
to
the
world
let
us
take
one
more
view
of
the
man
in
order
that
we
may
do
him
justice
and
remove
some
of
the
cruel
charges
against
him
as
the
meanest
of
mankind
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
from
the
beginning
of
his
career
until
his
fall
only
four
or
five
serious
charges
have
been
made
against
him
that
he
was
extravagant
in
his
mode
of
life
that
he
was
a
sycophant
and
that
he
deserted
his
patron
essex
that
he
tortured
peacham
a
puritan
clergyman
when
tried
for
that
he
himself
was
guilty
of
corruption
as
a
judge
in
regard
to
the
first
charge
it
is
unfortunately
too
true
he
lived
beyond
his
means
and
was
in
debt
most
of
his
life
this
defect
as
has
been
said
was
the
root
of
much
evil
it
destroyed
his
independence
detracted
from
the
dignity
of
his
character
created
enemies
and
led
to
a
laxity
of
the
moral
sense
which
prepared
the
way
for
corruption
thereby
furnishing
another
illustration
of
that
fatal
weakness
which
degrades
any
man
when
he
runs
races
with
the
rich
and
indulges
in
a
luxury
and
ostentation
which
he
can
not
afford
it
was
the
curse
of
cicero
of
william
pitt
and
of
daniel
webster
the
first
lesson
which
every
public
man
should
learn
especially
if
honored
with
important
trusts
is
to
live
within
his
income
however
inconvenient
and
galling
a
stringent
economy
is
necessary
but
this
defect
is
a
very
common
one
particularly
when
men
are
luxurious
or
brought
into
intercourse
with
the
rich
or
inclined
to
be
hospitable
and
generous
or
have
a
great
imagination
and
a
sanguine
temperament
so
that
those
who
are
most
liable
to
fall
into
this
folly
have
many
noble
qualities
to
offset
it
and
it
is
not
a
stain
which
marks
the
meanest
of
mankind
who
would
call
webster
the
meanest
of
mankind
because
he
had
an
absurd
desire
to
live
like
an
english
country
gentleman
in
regard
to
sycophancy
a
disgusting
trait
i
admit
we
should
consider
the
age
when
everybody
cringed
to
sovereigns
and
their
favorites
bacon
never
made
such
an
abject
speech
as
omer
talon
the
greatest
lawyer
in
france
did
to
louis
xiii
in
the
parliament
of
paris
three
hundred
years
ago
everybody
bowed
down
to
exalted
rank
witness
the
obsequious
language
which
all
authors
addressed
to
patrons
in
the
dedication
of
their
books
how
small
the
chance
of
any
man
rising
in
the
world
who
did
not
court
favors
from
those
who
had
favors
to
bestow
is
that
the
meanest
or
the
most
uncommon
thing
in
this
world
if
so
how
ignominious
are
all
politicians
who
flatter
the
people
and
solicit
their
votes
is
it
not
natural
to
be
obsequious
to
those
who
have
offices
to
bestow
this
trait
is
not
commendable
but
is
it
the
meanest
thing
we
see
in
regard
to
essex
nobody
can
approve
of
the
ingratitude
which
bacon
showed
to
his
noble
patron
but
on
the
other
hand
remember
the
good
advice
which
bacon
ever
gave
him
and
his
constant
efforts
to
keep
him
out
of
scrapes
how
often
did
he
excuse
him
to
his
royal
mistress
at
the
risk
of
incurring
her
displeasure
and
when
essex
was
guilty
of
a
thousand
times
worse
crime
than
ever
bacon
committed
even
in
a
time
of
tumult
and
insurrection
and
it
became
bacon
task
as
prosecuting
officer
of
the
crown
to
bring
this
great
culprit
to
justice
was
he
required
by
a
former
friendship
to
sacrifice
his
duty
and
his
allegiance
to
his
sovereign
to
screen
a
man
who
had
perverted
the
affection
of
the
noblest
woman
who
ever
wore
a
crown
and
came
near
involving
his
country
in
a
civil
war
grant
that
essex
had
bestowed
favors
and
was
an
accomplished
and
interesting
man
was
bacon
to
ignore
his
official
duties
he
may
have
been
too
harsh
in
his
procedure
but
in
that
age
all
criminal
proceedings
were
harsh
and
inexorable
there
was
but
little
mercy
shown
to
culprits
especially
to
traitors
if
elizabeth
could
bring
herself
out
of
respect
to
her
wounded
honor
and
slighted
kindness
and
the
dignity
of
the
realm
and
the
majesty
of
the
law
to
surrender
into
the
hands
of
justice
one
whom
she
so
tenderly
loved
and
magnificently
rewarded
even
when
the
sacrifice
cost
her
both
peace
and
life
snapped
the
last
cord
which
bound
her
to
this
world
may
we
not
forgive
bacon
for
the
part
he
played
does
this
fidelity
to
an
official
and
professional
duty
even
if
he
were
harsh
make
him
the
meanest
of
mankind
in
regard
to
peacham
it
is
true
he
was
tortured
according
to
the
practice
of
that
cruel
age
but
bacon
had
no
hand
in
the
issuing
of
the
warrant
against
him
for
although
in
accordance
with
custom
he
as
prosecuting
officer
of
the
crown
examined
peacham
under
torture
before
his
trial
the
parson
was
convicted
but
the
sentence
of
death
was
not
executed
upon
him
and
he
died
in
jail
and
in
regard
to
corruption
the
sin
which
cast
bacon
from
his
high
estate
though
fortunately
he
did
not
fall
like
lucifer
never
to
rise
again
may
not
the
verdict
of
the
poet
and
the
historian
be
rather
exaggerated
nobody
has
ever
attempted
to
acquit
bacon
for
taking
bribes
nobody
has
ever
excused
him
he
did
commit
a
crime
but
in
palliation
it
might
be
said
that
he
never
decided
against
justice
and
that
it
was
customary
for
great
public
functionaries
to
accept
presents
had
he
taken
them
after
he
had
rendered
judgment
instead
of
before
he
might
have
been
acquitted
for
out
of
the
seven
thousand
cases
which
he
decided
as
not
one
of
them
has
been
reversed
so
that
he
said
of
himself
i
was
the
justest
judge
that
england
has
had
for
fifty
years
and
i
suffered
the
justest
sentence
that
had
been
inflicted
for
two
hundred
years
he
did
not
excuse
himself
his
ingenuousness
of
confession
astonished
everybody
and
moved
the
hearts
of
his
judges
it
was
his
misfortune
to
be
in
debt
he
had
pressing
creditors
and
in
two
cases
he
accepted
presents
before
the
decision
was
made
but
was
brave
enough
to
decide
against
those
who
bribed
him
illoe
a
modern
corrupt
official
generally
covers
his
tracks
and
many
a
modern
judge
has
been
bribed
to
decide
against
justice
and
has
escaped
ignominy
even
in
a
country
which
claims
the
greatest
purity
and
the
loftiest
moral
standard
we
admit
that
bacon
was
a
sinner
but
was
he
a
sinner
above
all
others
who
cast
stones
at
jerusalem
in
reference
to
these
admitted
defects
and
crimes
i
only
wish
to
show
that
even
these
do
not
make
him
the
meanest
of
mankind
what
crimes
have
sullied
many
of
those
benefactors
whom
all
ages
will
admire
and
honor
and
whom
in
spite
of
their
defects
we
call
good
men
not
bad
men
to
be
forgiven
for
their
services
but
excellent
and
righteous
on
the
whole
see
abraham
telling
lies
to
the
king
of
egypt
and
jacob
robbing
his
brother
of
his
birthright
and
david
murdering
his
bravest
soldier
to
screen
himself
from
adultery
and
solomon

to
false

to
please
the
wicked

who

even
the
sun
passes
through
eclipses
have
the
spots
upon
the
career
of
bacon
hidden
the
brightness
of
his
general
beneficence
is
he
the
meanest
of
men
because
he
had
great
faults
when
we
speak
of
mean
men
it
is
those
whose
general
character
is
contemptible
now
see
bacon
pursuing
his
honorable
career
amid
rebuffs
and
enmities
and
jealousies
toiling
in
herculean
tasks
without
complaint
and
waiting
his
time
always
accessible
affable
gentle
with
no
vulgar
pride
if
he
aped
vulgar
ostentation
calm
beneficent
studious
without
envy
or
bitterness
interesting
in
his
home
courted
as
a
friend
admired
as
a
philosopher
generous
to
the
poor
kind
to
the
servants
who
cheated
him
with
an
unsubdued
love
of
nature
as
well
as
of
books
not
negligent
of
religious
duties
a
believer
in
god
and
immortality
and
though
broken
in
spirit
like
a
bruised
reed
yet
soaring
beyond
all
his
misfortunes
to
study
the
highest
problems
and
bequeathing
his
knowledge
for
the
benefit
of
future
ages
can
such
a
man
be
stigmatized
as
the
meanest
of
mankind
is
it
candid
and
just
for
a
great
historian
to
indorse
such
a
verdict
to
gloss
over
virtues
and
make
like
an
advocate
at
the
bar
or
an
ancient
sophist
a
special
plea
to
magnify
his
defects
and
stain
his
noble
name
with
an
infamy
as
deep
as
would
be
inflicted
upon
an
enemy
of
the
human
race
and
all
for
what
just
to
make
a
rhetorical
point
and
show
the
writer
brilliancy
and
genius
in
making
a
telling
contrast
between
the
man
and
the
philosopher
a
man
who
habitually
dwelt
in
the
highest
regions
of
thought
during
his
whole
life
absorbed
in
lofty
contemplations
all
from
love
of
truth
itself
and
to
benefit
the
world
could
not
have
had
a
mean
or
sordid
soul
as
a
man
thinketh
so
is
he
we
admit
that
he
was
a
man
of
the
world
politic
extravagant
careless
about
his
debts
and
how
he
raised
money
to
pay
them
but
we
deny
that
he
was
a
bad
judge
on
the
whole
or
was
unpatriotic
or
immoral
in
his
private
life
or
mean
in
his
ordinary
dealings
or
more
cruel
and
harsh
in
his
judicial
transactions
than
most
of
the
public
functionaries
of
his
rough
and
venal
age
we
admit
it
is
difficult
to
controvert
the
charges
which
macaulay
arrays
against
him
for
so
accurate
and
painstaking
an
historian
is
not
likely
to
be
wrong
in
his
facts
but
we
believe
that
they
are
uncandidly
stated
and
so
ingeniously
and
sophistically
put
as
to
give
on
the
whole
a
wrong
impression
of
the
man
making
him
out
worse
than
he
was
considering
his
age
and
circumstances
bacon
character
like
that
of
most
great
men
has
two
sides
and
while
we
are
compelled
painfully
to
admit
that
he
had
many
faults
we
shrink
from
classing
him
among
bad
men
as
is
implied
in
pope
characterization
of
him
as
the
meanest
of
mankind
we
now
take
leave
of
the
man
to
consider
his
legacy
to
the
world
and
here
again
we
are
compelled
to
take
issue
with
macaulay
not
in
regard
to
the
great
fact
that
bacon
inquiries
tended
to
a
new
revelation
of
nature
and
by
means
of
the
method
called
by
which
he
sought
to
establish
fixed
principles
of
science
that
could
not
be
controverted
but
in
reference
to
the
for
which
he
labored
the
aim
of
bacon
says
macaulay
was
utility
fruit
the
multiplication
of
human
enjoyments
the
mitigation
of
human
sufferings
the
prolongation
of
life
by
new
inventions
vitam
humanum
novis
inventis
et
the
conquest
of
nature
dominion
over
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
the
application
of
science
to
the
subjection
of
the
outward
world
progress
in
useful
arts
in
those
arts
which
enable
us
to
become
strong
comfortable
and
rich
in
houses
shops
fabrics
tools
merchandise
new
vegetables
fruits
and
animals
in
short
a
philosophy
which
will
not
raise
us
above
vulgar
wants
but
will
supply
those
wants
and
as
an
acre
in
middlesex
is
worth
more
than
a
principality
in
utopia
so
the
smallest
practical
good
is
better
than
any
magnificent
effort
to
realize
an
impossibility
and
hence
the
first
shoemaker
has
rendered
more
substantial
service
to
mankind
than
all
the
sages
of
greece
all
they
could
do
was
to
fill
the
world
with
long
beards
and
long
words
whereas
bacon
philosophy
has
lengthened
life
mitigated
pain
extinguished
disease
built
bridges
guided
the
thunderbolts
lightened
the
night
with
the
splendor
of
the
day
accelerated
motion
annihilated
distance
facilitated
intercourse
enabled
men
to
descend
to
the
depths
of
the
earth
to
traverse
the
land
in
cars
which
whirl
without
horses
and
the
ocean
in
ships
which
sail
against
the
wind
in
other
words
it
was
his
aim
to
stimulate
mankind
not
to
seek
unattainable
truth
but
useful
truth
that
is
the
science
which
produces
railroads
canals
cultivated
farms
ships
rich
returns
for
labor
silver
and
gold
from
the
mines
all
that
purchase
the
joys
of
material
life
and
fit
us
for
dominion
over
the
world
in
which
we
live
hence
anything
which
will
curtail
our
sufferings
and
add
to
our
pleasures
or
our
powers
should
be
sought
as
the
highest
good
geometry
is
desirable
not
as
a
noble
intellectual
exercise
but
as
a
handmaid
to
natural
philosophy
astronomy
is
not
to
assist
the
mind
to
lofty
contemplation
but
to
enable
mariners
to
verify
degrees
of
latitude
and
regulate
clocks
a
college
is
not
designed
to
train
and
discipline
the
mind
but
to
utilize
science
and
become
a
school
of
technology
greek
and
latin
exercises
are
comparatively
worthless
and
even
mathematics
unless
they
can
be
converted
into
practical
use
philosophy
as
ordinarily
understood
that
is
metaphysics
is
most
idle
of
all
since
it
does
not
pertain
to
mundane
wants
hence
the
old
grecian
philosopher
labored
in
vain
and
still
more
profitless
were
the
disquisitions
of
the
scholastics
of
the
middle
ages
since
they
were
chiefly
used
to
prop
up
unintelligible
creeds
theology
is
not
of
much
account
since
it
pertains
to
mysteries
we
can
not
solve
it
is
not
with
heaven
or
hell
or
abstract
inquiries
or
divine
certitudes
that
we
have
to
do
but
the
things
of
earth
things
that
advance
our
material
and
outward
condition
to
be
rich
and
comfortable
is
the
end
of
life
not
meditations
on
abstract
and
eternal
truth
such
as
elevate
the
soul
or
prepare
it
for
a
future
and
endless
life
the
certitudes
of
faith
of
love
of
friendship
are
of
small
value
when
compared
with
the
blessings
of
outward
prosperity
utilitarianism
is
the
true
philosophy
for
this
confines
us
to
the
world
where
we
are
born
to
labor
and
enables
us
to
make
acquisitions
which
promote
our
comfort
and
ease
the
chemist
and
the
manufacturer
are
our
greatest
benefactors
for
they
make
for
us
oils
and
gases
and
paints
things
we
must
have
the
philosophy
of
bacon
is
an
immense
improvement
on
all
previous
systems
since
it
heralds
the
jubilee
of
trades
the
millennium
of
merchants
the
schools
of
thrift
the
apostles
of
physical
progress
the
pioneers
of
enterprise
the
franklins
and
stephensons
and
tyndalls
and
morses
of
our
glorious
era
its
watchword
is
progress
all
hail
then
to
the
electric
telegraph
and
telephones
and
thames
tunnels
and
crystal
palaces
and
niagara
bridges
and
railways
over
the
rocky
mountains
the
day
of
our
deliverance
is
come
the
nations
are
saved
the
brunels
and
the
fieldses
are
our
victors
and
leaders
crown
them
with
olympic
leaves
as
the
heroes
of
our
great
games
of
life
and
thou
o
england
exalted
art
thou
among
the
nations
not
for
thy
oxfords
and
westminsters
not
for
thy
divines
and
saints
and
martyrs
and
poets
not
for
thy
hookers
and
leightons
and
cranmers
and
miltons
and
burkes
and
lockes
not
for
thy
reformation
not
for
thy
struggles
for
liberty
but
for
thy
manchesters
and
birminghams
thy
portsmouth
shipyards
thy
london
docks
thy
liverpool
warehouses
thy
mines
of
coal
and
iron
thy
countless
mechanisms
by
which
thou
bringest
the
wealth
of
nations
into
thy
banks
and
art
enabled
to
buy
the
toil
of
foreigners
and
to
raise
thy
standards
on
the
farthest
battlements
of
india
and
china
these
conquests
and
acquisitions
are
real
are
practical
machinery
over
life
the
triumph
of
physical
forces
dominion
over
waves
and
winds
these
are
the
great
victories
which
consummate
the
happiness
of
man
and
these
are
they
which
flow
from
the
philosophy
which
bacon
taught
now
macaulay
does
not
directly
say
all
these
things
but
these
are
the
spirit
and
gist
of
the
interpretation
which
he
puts
upon
writings
the
philosophy
of
bacon
leads
directly
to
these
blessings
and
these
constitute
its
great
peculiarity
and
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
new
era
which
bacon
heralded
was
fruitful
in
these
very
things
that
his
philosophy
encouraged
this
new
development
of
material
forces
but
it
may
be
questioned
whether
he
had
not
something
else
in
view
than
mere
utility
and
physical
progress
and
whether
his
method
could
not
equally
be
applied
to
metaphysical
subjects
whether
it
did
not
pertain
to
the
whole
domain
of
truth
and
take
in
the
whole
realm
of
human
inquiry
i
believe
that
bacon
was
interested
not
merely
in
the
world
of
matter
but
in
the
world
of
mind
that
he
sought
to
establish
principles
from
which
sound
deductions
might
be
made
as
well
as
to
establish
reliable
inductions
lord
campbell
thinks
that
a
perfect
system
of
ethics
could
be
made
out
of
his
writings
and
that
his
method
is
equally
well
adapted
to
examine
and
classify
the
phenomena
of
the
mind
he
separated
the
legitimate
paths
of
human
inquiry
giving
his
attention
to
poetry
and
politics
and
metaphysics
as
well
as
to
physics
bacon
does
not
sneer
as
macaulay
does
at
the
ancient
philosophers
he
bears
testimony
to
their
genius
and
their
unrivalled
dialectical
powers
even
if
he
regards
their
speculations
as
frequently
barren
he
does
not
flippantly
ridicule
the
and
the
as
mere
words
but
the
expression
and
exponent
of
profound
theological
distinctions
as
every
theologian
knows
them
to
be
he
does
not
throw
dirt
on
metaphysical
science
if
properly
directed
still
less
on
noble
inquiries
after
god
and
the
mysteries
of
life
he
is
subjective
as
well
as
objective
he
treats
of
philosophy
in
its
broadest
meaning
as
it
takes
in
the
province
of
the
understanding
the
memory
and
the
will
as
well
as
of
man
in
society
he
speaks
of
the
principles
of
government
and
of
the
fountains
of
law
of
universal
justice
of
eternal
spiritual
truth
so
that
playfair
judiciously
observes
and
he
was
a
scientist
that
it
was
not
by
sagacious
anticipations
of
science
afterwards
to
be
made
in
physics
that
his
writings
have
had
so
powerful
an
influence
as
in
his
knowledge
of
the
limits
and
resources
of
the
human
understanding
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
another
writer
prior
to
locke
whose
works
are
enriched
with
so
many
just
observations
on
mere
intellectual
phenomena
what
he
says
of
the
laws
of
memory
of
imagination
has
never
been
surpassed
in
subtlety
no
man
ever
more
carefully
studied
the
operation
of
his
own
mind
and
the
intellectual
character
of
others
nor
did
bacon
despise
metaphysical
science
only
the
frivolous
questions
that
the
old
scholastics
associated
with
it
and
the
general
barrenness
of
their
speculations
he
surely
would
not
have
disdained
the
subsequent
inquiries
of
locke
or
berkeley
or
leibnitz
or
kant
true
he
sought
definite
knowledge
something
firm
to
stand
upon
and
which
could
not
be
controverted
no
philosophy
can
be
sound
when
the
principle
from
which
deductions
are
made
is
not
itself
certain
or
very
highly
probable
or
when
this
principle
pushed
to
its
utmost
logical
sequence
would
lead
to
absurdity
or
even
to
a
conflict
with
human
consciousness
to
bacon
the
old
methods
were
wrong
and
it
was
his
primal
aim
to
reform
the
scientific
methods
in
order
to
arrive
at
truth
not
truth
for
utilitarian
ends
chiefly
but
truth
for
its
own
sake
he
loved
truth
as
palestrina
loved
music
or
raphael
loved
painting
or
socrates
loved
virtue
now
the
method
which
was
almost
exclusively
employed
until
bacon
time
is
commonly
called
the
method
that
is
some
principle
or
premise
was
assumed
to
be
true
and
reasoning
was
made
from
this
assumption
no
especial
fault
was
found
with
the
reasoning
of
the
great
masters
of
logic
like
aristotle
and
thomas
aquinas
for
it
never
has
been
surpassed
in
acuteness
and
severity
if
their
premises
were
admitted
their
conclusions
would
follow
as
a
certainty
what
was
wanted
was
to
establish
the
truth
of
premises
or
general
propositions
this
bacon
affirmed
could
be
arrived
at
only
by
that
is
the
ascending
from
ascertained
individual
facts
to
general
principles
by
extending
what
is
true
of
particulars
to
the
whole
class
in
which
they
belong
bacon
has
been
called
the
father
of
inductive
science
since
he
would
employ
the
inductive
method
yet
he
is
not
truly
the
father
of
induction
since
it
is
as
old
as
the
beginnings
of
science
hippocrates
when
he
ridiculed
the
quacks
of
his
day
and
collected
the
facts
and
phenomena
of
disease
and
inferred
from
them
the
proper
treatment
of
it
was
as
much
the
father
of
induction
as
bacon
himself
the
error
the
ancients
made
was
in
not
collecting
a
sufficient
number
of
facts
to
warrant
a
sound
induction
and
the
ancients
looked
out
for
facts
to
support
some
preconceived
theory
from
which
they
reasoned
syllogistically
the
theory
could
not
be
substantiated
by
any
syllogistic
reasonings
since
conclusions
could
never
go
beyond
assumptions
if
the
assumptions
were
wrong
no
ingenious
or
elaborate
reasoning
would
avail
anything
towards
the
discovery
of
truth
but
could
only
uphold
what
was
assumed
this
applied
to
theology
as
well
as
to
science
in
the
dark
ages
it
was
well
for
the
teachers
of
mankind
to
uphold
the
dogmas
of
the
church
which
they
did
with
masterly
dialectical
skill
those
were
ages
of
faith
and
not
of
inquiry
it
was
to
ground
believers
in
a
firm
faith
of
the
dogmas
which
were
deemed
necessary
to
support
the
church
and
the
cause
of
religion
they
were
regarded
as
absolute
certainties
there
was
no
dispute
about
the
premises
of
the
scholastic
arguments
and
hence
his
dialectics
strengthened
the
mind
by
the
exercise
of
logical
sports
and
at
the
same
time
confirmed
the
faith
the
world
never
saw
a
more
complete
system
of
dogmatic
theology
than
that
elaborated
by
thomas
aquinas
when
the
knowledge
of
the
greek
and
hebrew
was
rare
and
imperfect
and
it
was
impossible
to
throw
light
by
means
of
learning
and
science
on
the
texts
of
scripture
it
was
well
to
follow
the
interpretation
of
such
a
great
light
as
augustine
and
assume
his
dogmas
as
certainties
since
they
could
not
then
be
controverted
and
thus
from
them
construct
a
system
of
belief
which
would
confirm
the
faith
but
aquinas
with
his
aristotelian
method
of
syllogism
and
definitions
could
not
go
beyond
augustine
augustine
was
the
fountain
and
the
water
that
flowed
from
it
in
ten
thousand
channels
could
not
rise
above
the
spring
and
as
everybody
appealed
to
and
believed
in
saint
augustine
it
was
well
to
construct
a
system
from
him
to
confute
the
heretical
and
which
the
heretical
would
respect
the
scholastic
philosophy
which
some
ridicule
in
spite
of
its
puerilities
and
sophistries
and
syllogisms
preserved
the
theology
of
the
middle
ages
perhaps
of
the
fathers
it
was
a
mighty
bulwark
of
the
faith
which
was
then
accepted
no
honors
could
be
conferred
on
its
great
architects
that
were
deemed
extravagant
the
pope
and
the
clergy
saw
in
thomas
aquinas
the
great
defender
of
the
church
not
of
its
abuses
but
of
its
doctrines
and
if
no
new
light
can
be
shed
on
the
scripture
text
from
which
assumptions
were
made
if
these
assumptions
can
not
be
assailed
if
they
are
certitudes
then
we
can
scarcely
have
better
than
those
furnished
to
the
theologians
of
the
middle
ages
for
no
modern
dialetician
can
excel
them
in
severity
of
logic
the
great
object
of
modern
theologians
should
be
to
establish
the
authenticity
and
meaning
of
the
scripture
texts
on
which
their
assumptions
rest
and
this
can
be
done
only
by
the
method
which
bacon
laid
down
which
is
virtually
a
collation
and
collection
of
facts
that
is
divine
declarations
establish
the
meaning
of
these
without
question
and
we
have
from
which
we
may
deduce
creeds
and
systems
the
usefulness
of
which
can
not
be
exaggerated
especially
in
an
age
of
agnosticism
having
fundamental
principles
which
can
not
be
gainsaid
we
may
philosophically
draw
deductions
bacon
did
not
make
war
on
deduction
when
its
fundamental
truths
are
established
deduction
is
as
much
a
necessary
part
of
philosophy
as
induction
it
is
the
peculiarity
of
the
scotch
metaphysicians
who
have
ever
deduced
truths
from
those
previously
established
deduction
even
enters
into
modern
science
as
well
as
induction
when
cuvier
deduced
from
a
bone
the
form
and
habits
of
the
mastodon
when
kepler
deduced
his
great
laws
all
from
the
primary
thought
that
there
must
be
some
numerical
or
geographical
relation
between
the
times
distances
and
velocities
of
the
revolving
bodies
of
the
solar
system
when
newton
deduced
as
is
said
the
principle
of
gravitation
from
the
fall
of
an
apple
when
leverrier
sought
for
a
new
planet
from
the
perturbations
of
the
heavenly
bodies
in
their
orbits
we
feel
that
deduction
is
as
much
a
legitimate
process
as
induction
itself
but
deductive
logic
is
the
creation
of
aristotle
and
it
was
the
authority
of
aristotle
that
bacon
sought
to
subvert
the
inductive
process
is
also
old
of
which
bacon
is
called
the
father
how
are
these
things
to
be
reconciled
and
explained
wherein
and
how
did
bacon
adapt
his
method
to
the
discovery
of
truth
which
was
his
principal
aim
that
method
which
is
the
great
cause
of
modern
progress
in
science
the
way
to
it
being
indicated
by
him
the
whole
thing
consists
in
this
that
bacon
pointed
out
the
right
road
to
truth
as
a
board
where
two
roads
meet
or
diverge
indicates
the
one
which
is
to
be
followed
he
did
not
make
a
system
like
descartes
or
spinoza
or
newton
he
showed
the
way
to
make
it
on
sound
principles
he
laid
down
a
systematic
analysis
and
arrangement
of
inductive
evidence
the
syllogism
the
great
instrument
used
by
aristotle
and
the
is
from
its
very
nature
incompetent
to
prove
the
ultimate
premises
from
which
it
proceeds
and
when
the
truth
of
these
remains
doubtful
we
can
place
no
confidence
in
the
conclusions
drawn
from
them
hence
the
first
step
in
the
reform
of
science
is
to
review
its
ultimate
principles
and
the
first
condition
of
a
scientific
method
is
that
it
shall
be
competent
to
conduct
such
an
inquiry
and
this
method
is
applicable
not
to
physical
science
merely
but
to
the
whole
realm
of
knowledge
this
of
course
includes
poetry
art
intellectual
philosophy
and
theology
as
well
as
geology
and
chemistry
and
it
is
this
breadth
of
inquiry
directed
to
subjective
as
well
as
objective
knowledge
which
made
bacon
so
great
a
benefactor
the
defect
in
macaulay
criticism
is
that
he
makes
bacon
interested
in
mere
outward
phenomena
or
matters
of
practical
utility
a
worldly
utilitarian
of
whom
epicureans
may
be
proud
in
reality
he
soared
to
the
realm
of
plato
as
well
as
of
aristotle
take
for
instance
his
mentis
or
phantoms
of
the
human
mind
which
compose
the
part
of
the
novum
organum
the
idols
of
the
tribe
would
show
the
folly
of
attempting
to
penetrate
further
than
the
limits
of
the
human
faculties
permit
as
also
the
liability
of
the
intellect
to
be
warped
by
the
will
and
affections
and
the
like
the
idols
of
the
den
have
reference
to
the
tendency
to
notice
differences
rather
than
resemblances
or
resemblances
rather
than
differences
in
the
attachment
to
antiquity
or
novelty
in
the
partiality
to
minute
or
comprehensive
investigations
the
idols
of
the
have
reference
to
the
tendency
to
confound
words
with
things
which
has
ever
marked
controversialists
in
their
learned
disputations
in
what
he
here
says
about
the
necessity
for
accurate
definitions
he
reminds
us
of
socrates
rather
than
a
modern
scientist
this
necessity
for
accuracy
applies
to
metaphysics
as
much
as
it
does
to
physics
the
idols
of
the
theatre
have
reference
to
perverse
laws
of
demonstration
which
are
the
strongholds
of
error
this
school
deals
in
speculations
and
experiments
confined
to
a
narrow
compass
like
those
of
the
alchemists
too
imperfect
to
elicit
the
light
which
should
guide
bacon
having
completed
his
discussion
of
the
then
proceeds
to
point
out
the
weakness
of
the
old
philosophies
which
produced
leaves
rather
than
fruit
and
were
stationary
in
their
character
here
he
would
seem
to
lean
towards
utilitarianism
were
it
not
that
he
is
as
severe
on
men
of
experiment
as
on
men
of
dogma
the
men
of
experiment
are
says
he
like
ants
they
only
collect
and
use
the
reasoners
resemble
spiders
who
make
cobwebs
out
of
their
own
substance
but
the
bee
takes
a
middle
course
it
gathers
the
material
from
the
flowers
but
digests
it
by
a
power
of
its
own
so
true
philosophy
neither
chiefly
relies
on
the
powers
of
the
mind
nor
takes
the
matter
which
it
gathers
and
lays
it
up
in
the
memory
whole
as
it
finds
it
but
lays
it
up
in
the
understanding
to
be
transformed
and
digested
here
he
simply
points
out
the
laws
by
which
true
knowledge
is
to
be
attained
he
does
not
extol
physical
science
alone
though
doubtless
he
had
a
preference
for
it
over
metaphysical
inquiries
he
was
an
englishman
and
the
english
mind
is
objective
rather
than
subjective
and
is
prone
to
the
outward
and
the
seen
above
the
inward
and
unseen
and
perhaps
for
the
same
reason
that
the
old
testament
seems
to
make
prosperity
the
greatest
blessing
while
adversity
seems
to
be
the
blessing
of
the
new
testament
one
of
bacon
longest
works
is
the
silva
sylvarum
a
sort
of
natural
history
in
which
he
treats
of
the
various
forces
and
productions
of
nature
the
air
the
sea
the
winds
the
clouds
plants
and
animals
fire
and
water
sounds
and
discords
colors
and
smells
heat
and
cold
disease
and
health
but
which
varied
subjects
he
presents
to
communicate
knowledge
with
no
especial
utilitarian
end
the
advancement
of
learning
is
one
of
bacon
most
famous
productions
but
i
fail
to
see
in
it
an
objective
purpose
to
enable
men
to
become
powerful
or
rich
or
comfortable
it
is
rather
an
abstract
treatise
as
dry
to
most
people
as
legal
disquisitions
and
with
no
more
reference
to
rising
in
the
world
than
blackstone
commentaries
or
coke
upon
littleton
it
is
a
profound
dissertation
on
the
excellence
of
learning
its
great
divisions
treating
of
history
poetry
and
philosophy
of
metaphysical
as
well
as
physical
philosophy
of
the
province
of
understanding
the
memory
the
will
the
reason
and
the
imagination
and
of
man
in
society
of
government
of
universal
justice
of
the
fountains
of
law
of
revealed
religion
and
if
we
turn
from
the
new
method
by
which
he
would
advance
all
knowledge
and
on
which
his
fame
as
a
philosopher
chiefly
rests
that
method
which
has
led
to
discoveries
that
even
bacon
never
dreamed
of
not
thinking
of
the
fruit
he
was
to
bestow
but
only
the
way
to
secure
it
even
as
a
great
inventor
thinks
more
of
his
invention
than
of
the
money
he
himself
may
reap
from
it
as
a
work
of
creation
to
benefit
the
world
rather
than
his
own
family
and
in
the
work
of
which
his
mind
revels
in
a
sort
of
intoxicated
delight
like
a
true
poet
when
he
constructs
his
lines
or
a
great
artist
when
he
paints
his
picture
a
pure
subjective
joy
not
an
anticipated
gain
if
we
turn
from
this
method
to
most
of
his
other
writings
what
do
we
find
simply
the
lucubrations
of
a
man
of
letters
the
moral
wisdom
of
the
moralist
the
historian
the
biographer
the
essayist
in
these
writings
we
discover
no
more
worldliness
than
in
macaulay
when
he
wrote
his
milton
or
carlyle
when
he
penned
his
burns
even
less
for
bacon
did
not
write
to
gain
a
living
but
to
please
himself
and
give
vent
to
his
burning
thoughts
in
these
he
had
no
worldly
aim
to
reach
except
perhaps
an
imperishable
fame
he
wrote
as
michael
angelo
sculptured
his
moses
and
he
wrote
not
merely
amid
the
cares
and
duties
of
a
great
public
office
with
other
labors
which
might
be
called
herculean
but
even
amid
the
pains
of
disease
and
the
infirmities
of
age
when
rest
to
most
people
is
the
greatest
boon
and
solace
of
their
lives
take
his
essays
these
are
among
his
works
so
brilliant
and
forcible
suggestive
and
rich
that
even
archbishop
commentaries
upon
them
are
scarcely
an
addition
surely
these
are
not
on
material
subjects
and
indicate
anything
but
a
worldly
or
sordid
nature
in
these
famous
essays
so
luminous
with
the
gems
of
genius
we
read
not
such
exhortations
as
lord
chesterfield
impressed
upon
his
son
not
the
gossiping
frivolities
of
horace
walpole
not
the
cynical
wit
of
montaigne
but
those
great
certitudes
which
console
in
affliction
which
kindle
hope
which
inspire
lofty
resolutions
anchors
of
the
soul
pillars
of
faith
sources
of
immeasurable
joy
the
glorious
ideals
of
true
objects
of
desire
the
eternal
unities
of
truth
and
love
and
beauty
all
of
which
reveal
the
varied
experiences
of
life
and
the
riches
of
meditation
on
god
and
christianity
as
well
as
knowledge
of
the
world
and
the
desirableness
of
its
valued
gifts
how
beautiful
are
his
thoughts
on
death
on
adversity
on
glory
on
anger
on
friendship
on
fame
on
ambition
on
envy
on
riches
on
youth
and
old
age
and
divers
other
subjects
of
moral
import
which
show
the
elevation
of
his
soul
and
the
subjective
as
well
as
the
objective
turn
of
his
mind
not
dwelling
on
what
he
should
eat
and
what
he
should
drink
and
wherewithal
he
should
be
clothed
but
on
the
truths
which
appeal
to
our
higher
nature
and
which
raise
the
thoughts
of
men
from
earth
to
heaven
or
at
least
to
the
realms
of
intellectual
life
and
joy
and
then
it
is
necessary
that
we
should
take
in
view
other
labors
which
dignified
bacon
retirement
as
well
as
those
which
marked
his
more
active
career
as
a
lawyer
and
statesman
his
histories
and
biographies
as
well
as
learned
treatises
to
improve
the
laws
of
england
his
political
discourses
his
judicial
charges
his
theological
tracts
his
speeches
and
letters
and
prayers
all
of
which
had
relation
to
benefit
others
rather
than
himself
who
has
ever
done
more
to
instruct
the
world
to
enable
men
to
rise
not
in
fortune
merely
but
in
virtue
and
patriotism
in
those
things
which
are
of
themselves
the
only
reward
we
should
consider
these
labors
as
well
as
the
new
method
he
taught
to
arrive
at
knowledge
in
our
estimate
of
the
sage
as
well
as
of
the
man
he
was
a
moral
philosopher
like
socrates
he
even
soared
into
the
realm
of
supposititious
truth
like
plato
he
observed
nature
like
aristotle
he
took
away
the
syllogism
from
thomas
aquinas
not
to
throw
contempt
on
metaphysical
inquiry
or
dialectical
reasoning
but
to
arrive
by
a
better
method
at
the
knowledge
of
first
principles
which
once
established
he
allowed
deductions
to
be
drawn
from
them
leading
to
other
truths
as
certainly
as
induction
itself
yea
he
was
also
a
moses
on
the
mount
of
pisgah
from
which
with
prophetic
eye
he
could
survey
the
promised
land
of
indefinite
wealth
and
boundless
material
prosperity
which
he
was
not
permitted
to
enter
but
which
he
had
bequeathed
to
civilization
this
may
have
been
his
greatest
gift
in
the
view
of
scientific
men
this
inductive
process
of
reasoning
by
which
great
discoveries
have
been
made
after
he
was
dead
but
this
was
not
his
only
legacy
for
other
things
which
he
taught
were
as
valuable
not
merely
in
his
sight
but
to
the
eye
of
enlightened
reason
there
are
other
truths
besides
those
of
physical
science
there
is
greatness
in
deduction
as
well
as
in
induction
geometry
whose
successive
and
progressive
revelations
are
so
inspiring
and
which
have
come
down
to
us
from
a
remote
antiquity
which
are
even
now
taught
in
our
modern
schools
as
euclid
demonstrated
them
since
they
can
not
be
improved
is
a
purely
deductive
science
the
scholastic
philosophy
even
if
it
was
barren
and
unfruitful
in
leading
to
new
truths
yet
confirmed
what
was
valuable
in
the
old
systems
and
by
the
severity
of
its
logic
and
its
dialectical
subtleties
trained
the
european
mind
for
the
reception
of
the
message
of
luther
and
bacon
and
this
was
based
on
deductions
never
wrong
unless
the
premises
are
unsound
theology
is
deductive
reasoning
from
truths
assumed
to
be
fundamental
and
is
inductive
only
so
far
as
it
collates
scripture
declarations
and
interprets
their
meaning
by
the
aid
which
learning
brings
is
not
this
science
worthy
of
some
regard
will
it
not
live
when
all
the
speculations
of
evolutionists
are
forgotten
and
occupy
the
thoughts
of
the
greatest
and
profoundest
minds
so
long
as
anything
shall
be
studied
so
long
as
the
bible
shall
be
the
guide
of
life
is
it
not
by
deduction
that
we
ascend
from
nature
herself
to
the
god
of
nature
what
is
more
certain
than
deduction
when
the
principles
from
which
it
reasons
are
indisputably
established
is
induction
great
as
it
is
especially
in
the
explorations
of
nature
and
science
always
certain
are
not
most
of
the
sciences
which
are
based
upon
it
progressive
have
we
yet
learned
the
ultimate
principles
of
political
economy
or
of
geology
or
of
government
or
even
of
art
the
theory
of
induction
though
supposed
by
whewell
to
lead
to
certain
results
is
regarded
by
professor
jevons
as
leading
to
results
only
almost
certain
all
inductive
inference
is
merely
probable
says
the
present
professor
of
logic
thomas
fowler
in
the
university
of
oxford
and
although
it
is
supposed
that
the
inductive
method
of
bacon
has
led
to
the
noblest
discoveries
of
modern
times
is
this
strictly
true
galileo
made
his
discoveries
in
the
heavens
before
bacon
died
physical
improvements
must
need
follow
such
inventions
as
gunpowder
and
the
mariners
compass
and
printing
and
the
pictures
of
italy
and
the
discovery
of
mines
and
the
revived
arts
of
the
romans
and
greeks
and
the
glorious
emancipation
which
the
reformation
produced
why
should
not
the
modern
races
follow
in
the
track
of
carthage
and
alexandria
and
rome
with
the
progress
of
wealth
and
carry
out
inventions
as
those
cities
did
and
all
other
civilized
peoples
since
babal
towered
above
the
plains
of
babylon
physical
developments
arise
from
the
developments
of
man
whatever
method
may
be
recommended
by
philosophers
what
philosophical
teachings
led
to
the
machinery
of
the
mines
of
california
or
to
that
of
the
mills
of
lowell
some
think
that
our
modern
improvements
would
have
come
whether
bacon
had
lived
or
not
but
i
would
not
disparage
the
labors
of
bacon
in
pointing
out
the
method
which
leads
to
scientific
discoveries
granting
that
he
sought
merely
utility
an
improvement
in
the
outward
condition
of
society
which
is
the
view
that
macaulay
takes
i
would
not
underrate
his
legacy
and
even
supposing
that
the
blessings
of
material
life
the
acre
of
middlesex
are
as
much
to
be
desired
as
macaulay
with
the
complacency
of
an
eminently
practical
and
prosperous
man
seems
to
argue
i
would
not
sneer
at
them
who
does
not
value
them
who
will
not
value
them
so
long
as
our
mortal
bodies
are
to
be
cared
for
it
is
a
pleasant
thing
to
ride
in
cars
without
horses
to
feel
in
winter
the
genial
warmth
of
grates
and
furnaces
to
receive
messages
from
distant
friends
in
a
moment
of
time
to
cross
the
ocean
without
discomfort
with
the
almost
certainty
of
safety
and
save
our
wives
and
daughters
from
the
ancient
drudgeries
of
the
loom
and
the
who
ever
tires
in
gazing
at
a
locomotive
as
it
whirls
along
with
the
power
of
destiny
who
is
not
astonished
at
the
triumphs
of
the
engineer
the
wonders
of
an
the
marvellous
tunnels
under
lofty
mountains
we
feel
that
titans
have
been
sent
to
ease
us
of
our
burdens
but
great
and
beneficent
as
are
these
blessings
they
are
not
the
only
certitudes
nor
are
they
the
greatest
an
outward
life
of
ease
and
comfort
is
not
the
chief
end
of
man
the
interests
of
the
soul
are
more
important
than
any
comforts
of
the
body
the
higher
life
is
only
reached
by
lofty
contemplation
on
the
true
the
beautiful
and
the
good
subjective
wisdom
is
worth
more
than
objective
knowledge
what
are
the
great
realities
machinery
new
breeds
of
horses
carpets
diamonds
mirrors
gas
or
are
they
affections
friendships
generous
impulses
inspiring
thoughts
look
to
socrates
what
raised
that
barefooted
impecunious
persecuted
teacher
without
pay
to
the
loftiest
pedestal
of
athenian
fame
what
was
the
spirit
of
the
truths
taught
was
it
objective
or
subjective
truth
the
way
to
become
rich
and
comfortable
or
the
search
for
the
indefinite
the
infinite
the
eternal
utopia
not
middlesex
that
which
fed
the
wants
of
the
immaterial
soul
and
enabled
it
to
rise
above
temptation
and
vulgar
rewards
what
raised
plato
to
the
highest
pinnacle
of
intellectual
life
was
it
definite
and
practical
knowledge
of
outward
phenomena
or
was
it
a
longing
after
love
in
the
contemplation
of
which
the
mortal
soul
sustains
itself
and
becomes
participant
in
the
glories
of
immortality
what
were
realities
to
anselm
bernard
and
bonaventura
what
gave
beauty
and
placidity
to
descartes
and
leibnitz
and
kant
it
may
be
very
dignified
for
a
modern
savant
to
sit
serenely
on
his
tower
of
observation
indifferent
to
all
the
lofty
speculations
of
the
great
men
of
bygone
ages
yet
those
profound
questions
pertaining
to
the
greek
logos
and
the
greek
ta
onta
which
had
such
attractions
for
augustine
and
pascal
and
calvin
did
have
as
real
bearing
on
human
life
and
on
what
is
best
worth
knowing
as
the
scales
of
a
leuciscus
cephalus
or
the
limbs
of
a
magnified
animalculus
or
any
of
the
facts
of
which
physical
science
can
boast
the
wonders
of
science
are
great
but
so
also
are
the
secrets
of
the
soul
the
mysteries
of
the
spiritual
life
the
truths
which
come
from
divine
revelation
whatever
most
dignifies
humanity
and
makes
our
labors
sweet
and
causes
us
to
forget
our
pains
and
kindles
us
to
lofty
contemplations
and
prompts
us
to
heroic
sacrifice
is
the
most
real
and
the
most
useful
even
the
leaves
of
a
barren
and
neglected
philosophy
may
be
in
some
important
respects
of
more
value
than
all
the
boasted
fruit
of
utilitarian
science
is
that
which
is
most
useful
always
the
most
valuable
that
i

which
gives
the
highest
pleasure
do
we
not
plant
our
grounds
with
the
acacia
the
oak
the
cedar
the

as
well
as
with
the
apple
the

and
the
cherry
are
not
flowers

which
beautify
the

as
desirable
as

is
not
the

or

as
great
an
addition
to
even
a
poor
man
cottage
as
his

of
onions
or

of

what
is
the
scale
to
measure
even
mortal
happiness
what
is
the
marketable
value
of
friendship
or
of
love
what
makes
the
dinner
of
herbs
sometimes
more
refreshing
than
the
stalled
ox
what
is
the
material
profit
of
a
first
love
what
is
the
value
in
tangible
dollars
and
cents
of
a
beautiful
landscape
or
a
speaking
picture
or
a

or
a
living

or
the
voice
of
eloquence
or
the
charm
of
earliest
bird
or
the
smile
of
a
friend
or
the
promise
of
immortality
in
what
consisted
the
real
glory
of
the
country
we
are
never
weary
of
quoting
the
land
of
phidias
and
pericles
and
demosthenes
was
it
not
in
immaterial

in
patriotism
in
heroism
in
conceptions

in
speculations
on

and
unattainable
in

which
are
the

some
see
the
most
valued
fruits
of
human
invention

which
proved
a
canker
that
prepared

pious
emperor

his
wisdom
from

who
set
a
haughty
defiance
to
all
the
grandeur
and
all
the
comforts

astronomical
discoveries
among
the
wonders
of
the
sixteenth
century
was
the
appearance
of
a
new
star
in
the
northern
horizon
which
shining
at
first
with
a
feeble
light
gradually
surpassed
the
brightness
of
the
planet
jupiter
and
then
changing
its
color
from
white
to
yellow
and
from
yellow
to
red
after
seventeen
months
faded
away
from
the
sight
and
has
not
since
appeared
this
celebrated
star
first
seen
by
tycho
brahe
in
the
constellation
cassiopeia
never
changed
its
position
or
presented
the
slightest
perceptible
parallax
it
could
not
therefore
have
been
a
meteor
nor
a
planet
regularly
revolving
round
the
sun
nor
a
comet
blazing
with
fiery
nebulous
light
nor
a
satellite
of
one
of
the
planets
but
a
fixed
star
far
beyond
our
solar
system
such
a
phenomenon
created
an
immense
sensation
and
has
never
since
been
satisfactorily
explained
by
philosophers
in
the
infancy
of
astronomical
science
it
was
regarded
by
astrologers
as
a
sign
to
portend
the
birth
of
an
extraordinary
individual
though
the
birth
of
some
great
political
character
was
supposed
to
be
heralded
by
this
mysterious
star
its
prophetic
meaning
might
with
more
propriety
apply
to
the
extraordinary
man
who
astonished
his
contemporaries
by
discoveries
in
the
heavens
and
who
forms
the
subject
of
this
lecture
or
it
poetically
might
apply
to
the
brilliancy
of
the
century
itself
in
which
it
appeared
the
sixteenth
century
can
not
be
compared
with
the
nineteenth
century
in
the
variety
and
scope
of
scientific
discoveries
but
compared
with
the
ages
which
had
preceded
it
it
was
a
memorable
epoch
marked
by
the
simultaneous
breaking
up
of
the
darkness
of
mediaeval
europe
and
the
bursting
forth
of
new
energies
in
all
departments
of
human
thought
and
action
in
that
century
arose
great
artists
poets
philosophers
theologians
reformers
navigators
jurists
statesmen
whose
genius
has
scarcely
since
been
surpassed
in
italy
it
was
marked
by
the
triumphs
of
scholars
and
artists
in
germany
and
france
by
reformers
and
warriors
in
england
by
that
splendid
constellation
that
shed
glory
on
the
reign
of
elizabeth
close
upon
the
artists
who
followed
da
vinci
to
salvator
rosa
were
those
scholars
of
whom
emanuel
chrysoloras
erasmus
and
scaliger
were
the
representatives
going
back
to
the
classic
fountains
of
greece
and
rome
reviving
a
study
for
antiquity
breathing
a
new
spirit
into
universities
enriching
vernacular
tongues
collecting
and
collating
manuscripts
translating
the
scriptures
and
stimulating
the
learned
to
emancipate
themselves
from
the
trammels
of
the
scholastic
philosophers
then
rose
up
the
reformers
headed
by
luther
consigning
to
destruction
the
emblems
and
ceremonies
of
mediaeval
superstition
defying
popes
burning
bulls
ridiculing
monks
exposing
frauds
unravelling
sophistries
attacking
vices
and
traditions
with
the
new
arms
of
reason
and
asserting
before
councils
and
dignitaries
the
right
of
private
judgment
and
the
supreme
authority
of
the
bible
in
all
matters
of
religious
faith
and
then
appeared
the
defenders
of
their
cause
by
force
of
arms
maintaining
the
great
rights
of
religious
liberty
in
france
germany
switzerland
holland
and
england
until
protestantism
was
established
in
half
of

period
which
enslaved
the
human
soul
but
what
peculiarly
marked
that
period
was
the
commencement
of
those
marvellous
discoveries
in
science
which
have
enriched
our
times
and
added
to
the
material
blessings
of
the
new
civilization
tycho
brahe
copernicus
galileo
kepler
and
bacon
inaugurated
the
era
which
led
to
progressive
improvements
in
the
physical
condition
of
society
and
to
those
scientific
marvels
which
have
followed
in
such
quick
succession
and
produced
such
astonishing
changes
that
we
are
fain
to
boast
that
we
have
entered
upon
the
most
fortunate
and
triumphant
epoch
in
our
world
history
many
men
might
be
taken
as
the
representatives
of
this
new
era
of
science
and
material
inventions
but
i
select
galileo
galilei
as
one
of
the
most
interesting
in
his
life
opinions
and
conflicts
galileo
was
born
at
pisa
in
the
year
the
year
that
calvin
and
michael
angelo
died
four
years
after
the
birth
of
bacon
in
the
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of
elizabeth
and
the
fourth
of
charles
about
the
time
when
the
huguenot
persecution
was
at
its
height
and
the
spanish
monarchy
was
in
its
most
prosperous
state
under
philip
ii
his
parents
were
of
a
noble
but
impoverished
florentine
family
and
his
father
who
was
a
man
of
some
learning
a
writer
on
the
science
of
music
gave
him
the
best
education
he
could
afford
like
so
many
of
the
most
illustrious
men
he
early
gave
promise
of
rare
abilities
it
was
while
he
was
a
student
in
the
university
of
his
native
city
that
his
attention
was
arrested
by
the
vibrations
of
a
lamp
suspended
from
the
ceiling
of
the
cathedral
and
before
he
had
quitted
the
church
while
the
choir
was
chanting
mediaeval
anthems
he
had
compared
those
vibrations
with
his
own
pulse
which
after
repeated
experiments
ended
in
the
construction
of
the
first
pendulum
applied
not
as
it
was
by
huygens
to
the
measurement
of
time
but
to
medical
science
to
enable
physicians
to
ascertain
the
rate
of
the
pulse
but
the
pendulum
was
soon
brought
into
the
service
of
the
clockmakers
and
ultimately
to
the
determination
of
the
form
of
the
earth
by
its
minute
irregularities
in
diverse
latitudes
and
finally
to
the
measurement
of
differences
of
longitude
by
its
connection
with
electricity
and
the
recording
of
astronomical
observations
thus
it
was
that
the
swinging
of
a
cathedral
lamp
before
the
eye
of
a
man
of
genius
has
done
nearly
as
much
as
the
telescope
itself
to
advance
science
to
say
nothing
of
its
practical
uses
in
common
life
galileo
had
been
destined
by
his
father
to
the
profession
of
medicine
and
was
ignorant
of
mathematics
he
amused
his
leisure
hours
with
painting
and
music
and
in
order
to
study
the
principles
of
drawing
he
found
it
necessary
to
acquire
some
knowledge
of
geometry
much
to
the
annoyance
of
his
father
who
did
not
like
to
see
his
mind
diverted
from
the
prescriptions
of
hippocrates
and
galen
the
certain
truths
of
geometry
burst
upon
him
like
a
revelation
and
after
mastering
euclid
he
turned
to
archimedes
with
equal
enthusiasm
mathematics
now
absorbed
his
mind
and
the
father
was
obliged
to
yield
to
the
bent
of
his
genius
which
seemed
to
disdain
the
regular
professions
by
which
social
position
was
most
surely
effected
he
wrote
about
this
time
an
essay
on
the
hydrostatic
balance
which
introduced
him
to
guido
ubaldo
a
famous
mathematician
who
induced
him
to
investigate
the
subject
of
the
centre
of
gravity
in
solid
bodies
his
treatise
on
this
subject
secured
an
introduction
to
the
grand
duke
of
tuscany
who
perceived
his
merits
and
by
whom
he
was
appointed
a
lecturer
on
mathematics
at
pisa
but
on
the
small
salary
of
sixty
crowns
a
year
this
was
in
when
he
was
an
enthusiastic
young
man
full
of
hope
and
animal
spirits
the
charm
of
every
circle
for
his
intelligence
vivacity
and
wit
but
bold
and
sarcastic
contemptuous
of
ancient
dogmas
defiant
of
authority
and
therefore
no
favorite
with
jesuit
priests
and
dominican
professors
it
is
said
that
he
was
a
handsome
man
with
bright
golden
locks
such
as
painters
in
that
age
loved
to
perpetuate
upon
the
canvas
hilarious
and
cheerful
fond
of
good
cheer
yet
a
close
student
obnoxious
only
to
learned
dunces
and
narrow
pedants
and
treadmill
professors
and
bigoted
priests
all
of
whom
sought
to
molest
him
yet
to
whom
he
was
either
indifferent
or
sarcastic
holding
them
and
their
formulas
up
to
ridicule
he
now
directed
his
inquiries
to
the
mechanical
doctrines
of
aristotle
to
whose
authority
the
schools
had
long
bowed
down
and
whom
he
too
regarded
as
one
of
the
great
intellectual
giants
of
the
world
yet
not
to
be
credited
without
sufficient
reasons
before
the
novum
organum
was
written
he
sought
as
bacon
himself
pointed
out
the
way
to
arrive
at
truth
a
foundation
to
stand
upon
a
principle
tested
by
experience
which
when
established
by
experiment
would
serve
for
sure
deductions
now
one
of
the
principles
assumed
by
aristotle
and
which
had
never
been
disputed
was
that
if
different
weights
of
the
same
material
were
let
fall
from
the
same
height
the
heavier
would
reach
the
ground
sooner
than
the
lighter
and
in
proportion
to
the
difference
of
weight
this
assumption
galileo
denied
and
asserted
that
with
the
exception
of
a
small
different
owing
to
the
resistance
of
the
air
both
would
fall
to
the
ground
in
the
same
space
of
time
to
prove
his
position
by
actual
experiment
he
repaired
to
the
leaning
tower
of
pisa
and
demonstrated
that
he
was
right
and
aristotle
was
wrong
the
aristotelians
would
not
believe
the
evidence
of
their
own
senses
and
ascribed
the
effect
to
some
unknown
cause
to
such
a
degree
were
men
enslaved
by
authority
this
provoked
galileo
and
led
him
to
attack
authority
with
still
greater
vehemence
adding
mockery
to
sarcasm
which
again
exasperated
his
opponents
and
doubtless
laid
the
foundation
of
that
personal
hostility
which
afterwards
pursued
him
to
the
prison
of
the
inquisition
this
blended
arrogance
and
asperity
in
a
young
man
was
offensive
to
the
whole
university
yet
natural
to
one
who
had
overturned
one
of
the
favorite
axioms
of
the
greatest
master
of
thought
the
world
had
seen
for
nearly
two
thousand
years
and
the
scorn
and
opposition
with
which
his
discovery
was
received
increased
his
rancor
so
that
he
in
his
turn
did
not
render
justice
to
the
learned
men
arrayed
against
him
who
were
not
necessarily
dull
or
obstinate
because
they
would
not
at
once
give
up
the
opinions
in
which
they
were
educated
and
which
the
learned
world
still
accepted
nor
did
they
oppose
and
hate
him
for
his
new
opinions
so
much
as
from
dislike
of
his
personal
arrogance
and
bitter
sarcasms
at
last
his
enemies
made
it
too
hot
for
him
at
pisa
he
resigned
his
chair
but
only
to
accept
a
higher
position
at
padua
on
a
salary
of
one
hundred
and
eighty
florins
not
however
adequate
to
his
support
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
take
pupils
in
mathematics
to
show
the
comparative
estimate
of
that
age
of
science
the
fact
may
be
mentioned
that
the
professor
of
scholastic
philosophy
in
the
same
university
was
paid
fourteen
hundred
florins
this
was
in
and
the
next
year
galileo
invented
the
thermometer
still
an
imperfect
instrument
since
air
was
not
perfectly
excluded
at
this
period
his
reputation
seems
to
have
been
established
as
a
brilliant
lecturer
rather
than
as
a
great
discoverer
or
even
as
a
great
mathematician
for
he
was
immeasurably
behind
kepler
his
contemporary
in
the
power
of
making
abstruse
calculations
and
numerical
combinations
in
this
respect
kepler
was
inferior
only
to
copernicus
newton
and
laplace
in
our
times
or
hipparchus
and
ptolemy
among
the
ancients
and
it
is
to
him
that
we
owe
the
discovery
of
those
great
laws
of
planetary
motion
from
which
there
is
no
appeal
and
which
have
never
been
rivalled
in
importance
except
those
made
by
newton
himself
laws
which
connect
the
mean
distance
of
the
planets
from
the
sun
with
the
times
of
their
revolutions
laws
which
show
that
the
orbits
of
planets
are
elliptical
not
circular
and
that
the
areas
described
by
lines
drawn
from
the
moving
planet
to
the
sun
are
proportionable
to
the
times
employed
in
the
motion
what
an
infinity
of
calculation
in
the
infancy
of
science
before
the
invention
of
logarithms
was
necessary
to
arrive
at
these
truths
what
fertility
of
invention
was
displayed
in
all
his
hypotheses
what
patience
in
working
them
out
what
magnanimity
in
discarding
those
which
were
not
true
what
power
of
guessing
even
to
hit
upon
theories
which
could
be
established
by
elaborate
calculations
all
from
the
primary
thought
the
grand
axiom
which
kepler
was
the
first
to
propose
that
there
must
be
some
numerical
or
geometrical
relations
among
the
times
distances
and
velocities
of
the
revolving
bodies
of
the
solar
system
it
would
seem
that
although
his
science
was
deductive
he
invoked
the
aid
of
induction
also
a
great
original
genius
yet
modest
like
newton
a
man
who
avoided
hostilities
yet
given
to
the
most
boundless
enthusiasm
on
the
subjects
to
which
he
devoted
his
life
how
intense
his
raptures
nothing
holds
me
he
writes
on
discovering
his
great
laws
i
will
indulge
in
my
sacred
fury
i
will
boast
of
the
golden
vessels
i
have
stolen
from
the
egyptians
if
you
forgive
me
i
rejoice
if
you
are
angry
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
the
die
is
cast
the
book
is
written
to
be
read
either
now
or
by
posterity
i
care
not
which
it
may
well
wait
a
century
for
a
reader
as
god
has
waited
six
thousand
years
for
an
observer
we
do
not
see
this
sublime
repose
in
the
attitude
of
galileo
this
falling
back
on
his
own
conscious
greatness
willing
to
let
things
take
their
natural
course
but
rather
on
the
other
hand
an
impatience
under
contradiction
a
vehement
scorn
of
adversaries
and
an
intellectual
arrogance
that
gave
offence
and
impeded
his
career
and
injured
his
fame
no
matter
how
great
a
man
may
be
his
intellectual
pride
is
always
offensive
and
when
united
with
sarcasm
and
mockery
it
will
make
bitter
enemies
who
will
pull
him
down
galileo
on
his
transfer
to
padua
began
to
teach
the
doctrines
of
copernicus
a
much
greater
genius
than
he
and
yet
one
who
provoked
no
enmities
although
he
made
the
greatest
revolution
in
astronomical
knowledge
that
any
man
ever
made
since
he
was
in
no
haste
to
reveal
his
discoveries
and
stated
them
in
a
calm
and
inoffensive
way
i
doubt
if
new
discoverers
in
science
meet
with
serious
opposition
when
men
themselves
are
not
attacked
and
they
are
made
to
appeal
to
calm
intelligence
and
war
is
not
made
on
those
scripture
texts
which
seem
to
controvert
them
even
theologians
receive
science
when
science
is
not
made
to
undermine
theological
declarations
and
when
the
divorce
of
science
from
revelation
reason
from
faith
as
two
distinct
realms
is
vigorously
insisted
upon
pascal
incurred
no
hostilities
for
his
scientific
investigations
nor
newton
nor
laplace
it
is
only
when
scientific
men
sneer
at
the
bible
because
its
declarations
can
not
always
be
harmonized
with
science
that
the
hostilities
of
theologians
are
provoked
and
it
is
only
when
theologians
deny
scientific
discoveries
that
seem
to
conflict
with
texts
of
scripture
that
opposition
arises
among
scientific
men
it
would
seem
that
the
doctrines
of
copernicus
were
offensive
to
churchmen
on
this
narrow
ground
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
the
earth
revolved
around
the
sun
when
the
opinions
of
the
learned
for
two
thousand
years
were
unanimous
that
the
sun
revolved
around
the
earth
had
both
theologian
and
scientist
let
the
bible
alone
there
would
not
have
been
a
bitter
war
between
them
but
scientists
were
accused
by
theologians
of
undermining
the
bible
and
the
theologians
were
accused
of
stupid
obstinacy
and
were
mercilessly
exposed
to
ridicule
that
was
the
great
error
of
galileo
he
made
fun
and
sport
of
the
theologians
as
samson
did
of
the
philistines
and
the
philistines
of
galileo
day
cut
off
his
locks
and
put
out
his
eyes
when
the
pope
put
him
into
their
power
those
dominican
inquisitors
who
made
a
crusade
against
human
thought
if
galileo
had
shown
more
tact
and
less
arrogance
possibly
those
dominican
doctors
might
have
joined
the
chorus
of
universal
praise
for
they
were
learned
men
although
devoted
to
a
bad
system
and
incapable
of
seeing
truth
when
their
old
authorities
were
ridiculed
and
set
at
nought
galileo
did
not
deny
the
scriptures
but
his
spirit
was
mocking
and
he
seemed
to
prejudiced
people
to
undermine
the
truths
which
were
felt
to
be
vital
for
the
preservation
of
faith
in
the
world
and
as
some
scientific
truths
seemed
to
be
adverse
to
scripture
declarations
the
transition
was
easy
to
a
denial
of
the
inspiration
which
was
claimed
by
nearly
all
christian
sects
both
catholic
and
protestant
the
intolerance
of
the
church
in
every
age
has
driven
many
scientists
into
infidelity
for
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
tendency
of
scientific
investigation
has
been
to
make
scientific
men
incredulous
of
divine
inspiration
and
hence
to
undermine
their
faith
in
dogmas
which
good
men
have
ever
received
and
which
are
supported
by
evidence
that
is
not
merely
probable
but
almost
certain
and
all
now
that
seems
wanting
to
harmonize
science
with
revelation
is
on
the
one
hand
the
of
the
scripture
texts
on
which
are
based
the
principia
from
which
deductions
are
made
and
which
we
call
theology
and
on
the
other
hand
the
rejection
of
indefensible
statements
which
are
at
war
with
both
science
and
consciousness
except
in
those
matters
which
claim
special
supernatural
agency
which
we
can
neither
prove
nor
disprove
by
reason
for
supernaturalism
claims
to
transcend
the
realm
of
reason
altogether
in
what
relates
to
the
government
of
god
ways
that
no
searching
will
ever
enable
us
to
find
out
with
our
limited
faculties
and
obscured
understanding
when
the
two
realms
of
reason
and
faith
are
kept
distinct
and
neither
encroaches
on
the
other
then
the
discoveries
and
claims
of
science
will
meet
with
but
little
opposition
from
theologians
and
they
will
be
left
to
be
sifted
by
men
who
alone
are
capable
of
the
task
thus
far
science
outside
of
pure
mathematics
is
made
up
of
theories
which
are
greatly
modified
by
advancing
knowledge
so
that
they
can
not
claim
in
all
respects
to
be
eternally
established
like
the
laws
of
kepler
and
the
discoveries
of
copernicus
the
latter
of
which
were
only
true
in
the
main
fact
that
the
earth
revolves
around
the
sun
but
even
he
retained
epicycles
and
excentrics
and
could
not
explain
the
unequal
orbits
of
planetary
motion
in
fact
he
retained
many
of
the
errors
of
hipparchus
and
ptolemy
much
too
as
we
are
inclined
to
ridicule
the
astronomy
of
the
ancients
because
they
made
the
earth
the
centre
we
should
remember
that
they
also
resolved
the
orbits
of
the
heavenly
bodies
into
circular
motions
discovered
the
precession
of
the
equinoxes
and
knew
also
the
apparent
motions
of
the
planets
and
their
periods
they
could
predict
eclipses
of
the
sun
and
moon
and
knew
that
the
orbit
of
the
sun
and
planets
was
through
a
belt
in
the
heavens
of
a
few
degrees
in
width
which
they
called
the
zodiac
they
did
not
know
indeed
the
difference
between
real
and
apparent
motion
nor
the
distance
of
the
sun
and
stars
nor
their
relative
size
and
weight
nor
the
laws
of
motion
nor
the
principles
of
gravitation
nor
the
nature
of
the
milky
way
nor
the
existence
of
nebulae
nor
any
of
the
wonders
which
the
telescope
reveals
but
in
the
severity
of
their
mathematical
calculations
they
were
quite
equal
to
modern
astronomers
if
copernicus
revolutionized
astronomy
by
proving
the
sun
to
be
the
centre
of
motion
to
our
planetary
system
galileo
gave
it
an
immense
impulse
by
his
discoveries
with
the
telescope
these
did
not
require
such
marvellous
mathematical
powers
as
made
kepler
and
newton
immortal
the
equals
of
ptolemy
and
hipparchus
in
mathematical
demonstration
but
only
accuracy
and
perseverance
in
observations
doubtless
he
was
a
great
mathematician
but
his
fame
rests
on
his
observations
and
the
deductions
he
made
from
them
these
were
more
easily
comprehended
and
had
an
objective
value
which
made
him
popular
and
for
these
discoveries
he
was
indebted
in
a
great
measure
to
the
labors
of
others
it
was
mechanical
invention
applied
to
the
advancement
of
science
the
utilization
of
science
was
reserved
to
our
times
and
it
is
this
utilization
which
makes
science
such
a
handmaid
to
the
enrichment
of
its
votaries
and
holds
it
up
to
worship
in
our
laboratories
and
schools
of
technology
and
mines
not
merely
for
itself
but
also
for
the
substantial
fruit
it
yields
it
was
when
galileo
was
writing
treatises
on
the
structure
of
the
universe
on
local
motion
on
sound
on
continuous
quantity
on
light
on
colors
on
the
tides
on
dialing
subjects
that
also
interested
lord
bacon
at
the
same
period
and
when
he
was
giving
lectures
on
these
subjects
with
immense
frequently
to
one
thousand
persons
scarcely
less
than
what
abélard
enjoyed
when
he
made
fun
of
the
more
conservative
schoolmen
with
whom
he
was
brought
in
contact
that
he
heard
while
on
a
visit
to
venice
that
a
dutch
had
invented
an
instrument
which
was
said
to
represent
distant
objects
nearer
than
they
usually
appeared
this
was
in
when
he
at
the
age
of
was
the
idol
of
scientific
men
and
was
in
the
enjoyment
of
an
ample
revenue
giving
only
sixty
in
the
year
to
lectures
and
allowed
time
to
prosecute
his
studies
in
that
sweet
solitariness
which
all
true
scholars
prize
and
without
which
few
great
attainments
are
made
the
rumor
of
the
invention
excited
in
his
mind
the
intensest
interest
he
sought
for
the
explanation
of
the
fact
in
the
doctrine
of
refraction
he
meditated
day
and
night
at
last
he
himself
constructed
an
instrument
a
leaden
organ
pipe
with
two
spectacle
glasses
both
plain
on
one
side
while
one
of
them
had
its
opposite
side
convex
and
the
other
its
second
side
concave
this
crude
little
instrument
which
magnified
but
three
times
he
carries
in
triumph
back
to
venice
it
is
regarded
as
a
scientific
toy
yet
everybody
wishes
to
see
an
instrument
by
which
the
human
eye
indefinitely
multiplies
its
power
the
doge
is
delighted
and
the
senate
is
anxious
to
secure
so
great
a
curiosity
he
makes
a
present
of
it
to
the
senate
after
he
has
spent
a
month
in
showing
it
round
to
the
principal
people
of
that
wealthy
city
and
he
is
rewarded
for
his
ingenuity
with
an
increase
of
his
salary
at
padua
to
one
thousand
florins
and
is
made
professor
for
life
he
now
only
thinks
of
making
discoveries
in
the
heavens
but
his
instrument
is
too
small
he
makes
another
and
larger
telescope
which
magnifies
eight
times
and
then
another
which
magnifies
thirty
times
and
points
it
to
the
moon
and
how
indescribable
his
satisfaction
for
he
sees
what
no
mortal
had
ever
before
seen
ranges
of
mountains
deep
hollows
and
various
inequalities
these
discoveries
it
would
seem
are
not
favorably
received
by
the
aristotelians
however
he
continues
his
labors
and
points
his
telescope
to
the
planets
and
fixed
stars
but
the
magnitude
of
the
latter
remain
the
same
while
the
planets
appear
with
disks
like
the
moon
then
he
directs
his
observations
to
the
pleiades
and
counts
forty
stars
in
the
cluster
when
only
six
were
visible
to
the
naked
eye
in
the
milky
way
he
descries
crowds
of
minute
stars
having
now
reached
the
limit
of
discovery
with
his
present
instrument
he
makes
another
of
still
greater
power
and
points
it
to
the
planet
jupiter
on
the
of
january
he
observes
three
little
stars
near
the
body
of
the
planet
all
in
a
straight
line
and
parallel
to
the
ecliptic
two
on
the
east
and
one
on
the
west
of
jupiter
on
the
next
observation
he
finds
that
they
have
changed
places
and
are
all
on
the
west
of
jupiter
and
the
next
time
he
observes
them
they
have
changed
again
he
also
discovers
that
there
are
four
of
these
little
stars
revolving
round
the
planet
what
is
the
explanation
of
this
singular
phenomenon
they
can
not
be
fixed
stars
or
planets
they
must
then
be
moons
jupiter
is
attended
with
satellites
like
the
earth
but
has
four
instead
of
one
the
importance
of
this
last
discovery
was
of
supreme
value
for
it
confirmed
the
heliocentric
theory
old
kepler
is
filled
with
agitations
of
joy
all
the
friends
of
galileo
extol
his
genius
his
fame
spreads
far
and
near
he
is
regarded
as
the
ablest
scientific
man
in
europe
his
enemies
are
now
dismayed
and
perplexed
the
principal
professor
of
philosophy
at
padua
would
not
even
look
through
the
wonderful
instrument
sissi
of
florence
ridicules
the
discovery
as
said
he
there
are
only
seven
apertures
of
the
head
two
eyes
two
ears
two
nostrils
and
one
mouth
and
as
there
are
only
seven
days
in
the
week
and
seven
metals
how
can
there
be
seven
planets
but
science
discarded
by
the
schools
fortunately
finds
a
refuge
among
princes
cosimo
de
medici
prefers
the
testimony
of
his
senses
to
the
voice
of
authority
he
observes
the
new
satellites
with
galileo
at
pisa
makes
him
a
present
of
one
thousand
florins
and
gives
him
a
mere
nominal
office
that
of
lecturing
occasionally
to
princes
on
a
salary
of
one
thousand
florins
for
life
he
is
now
the
chosen
companion
of
the
great
and
the
admiration
of
italy
he
has
rendered
an
immense
service
to
astronomy
his
discovery
of
the
satellites
of
jupiter
says
herschel
gave
the
holding
turn
to
the
opinion
of
mankind
respecting
the
copernican
system
and
pointed
out
a
connection
between
speculative
astronomy
and
practical
utility
but
this
did
not
complete
the
catalogue
of
his
discoveries
in
he
perceived
that
saturn
appeared
to
be
triple
and
excited
the
curiosity
of
astronomers
by
the
publication
of
his
first
enigma
planetam
tergeminam
he
could
not
then
perceive
the
rings
the
planet
seemed
through
his
telescope
to
have
the
form
of
three
concentric
o
soon
after
in
examining
venus
he
saw
her
in
the
form
of
a
crescent
figuras
oemulatur
mater
venus
rivals
the
phases
of
the
moon
at
last
he
discovers
the
spots
upon
the
sun
disk
and
that
they
all
revolve
with
the
sun
and
therefore
that
the
sun
has
a
revolution
in
about
days
and
may
be
moving
on
in
a
larger
circle
with
all
its
attendant
planets
around
some
distant
centre
galileo
has
now
attained
the
highest
object
of
his
ambition
he
is
at
the
head
confessedly
of
all
the
scientific
men
of
europe
he
has
an
ample
revenue
he
is
independent
and
has
perfect
leisure
even
the
pope
is
gracious
to
him
when
he
makes
a
visit
to
rome
while
cardinals
princes
and
ambassadors
rival
one
another
in
bestowing
upon
him
attention
and
honors
but
there
is
no
height
of
fortune
from
which
a
man
may
not
fall
and
it
is
usually
the
proud
the
ostentatious
and
the
contemptuous
who
do
fall
since
they
create
envy
and
are
apt
to
make
social
mistakes
galileo
continued
to
exasperate
his
enemies
by
his
arrogance
and
sarcasms
they
refused
to
be
dragged
at
his
the
aristotelian
professors
says
brewster
the
temporizing
jesuits
the
political
churchmen
and
that
timid
but
respectable
body
who
at
all
times
dread
innovation
whether
it
be
in
legislation
or
science
entered
into
an
alliance
against
the
philosophical
tyrant
who
threatened
them
with
the
penalties
of
knowledge
the
church
dignitaries
were
especially
hostile
since
they
thought
the
tendency
of
galileo
investigations
was
to
undermine
the
bible
flanked
by
the
logic
of
the
schools
and
the
popular
interpretation
of
scripture
and
backed
by
the
civil
power
they
were
eager
for
war
galileo
wrote
a
letter
to
his
friend
the
abbé
castelli
the
object
of
which
was
to
prove
that
the
scriptures
were
not
intended
to
teach
science
and
philosophy
but
to
point
out
the
way
of
salvation
he
was
indiscreet
enough
to
write
a
longer
letter
of
seventy
pages
quoting
the
fathers
in
support
of
his
views
and
attempting
to
show
that
nature
and
scripture
could
not
speak
a
different
language
it
was
this
reasoning
which
irritated
the
dignitaries
of
the
church
more
than
his
discoveries
since
it
is
plain
that
the
literal
language
of
scripture
upholds
the
doctrine
that
the
sun
revolves
around
the
earth
he
was
wrong
or
foolish
in
trying
to
harmonize
revelation
and
science
he
should
have
advanced
his
truths
of
science
and
left
them
to
take
care
of
themselves
he
should
not
have
meddled
with
the
dogmas
of
his
enemies
not
that
he
was
wrong
in
doing
so
but
it
was
not
politic
or
wise
and
he
was
not
called
upon
to
harmonize
scripture
with
science
so
his
enemies
busily
employed
themselves
in
collecting
evidence
against
him
they
laid
their
complaints
before
the
inquisition
of
rome
and
on
the
occasion
of
paying
a
visit
to
that
city
he
was
summoned
before
that
tribunal
which
has
been
the
shame
and
the
reproach
of
the
catholic
church
it
was
a
tribunal
utterly
incompetent
to
sit
upon
his
case
since
it
was
ignorant
of
science
in
it
was
decreed
that
galileo
should
renounce
his
obnoxious
doctrines
and
pledge
himself
neither
to
defend
nor
publish
them
in
future
and
galileo
accordingly
in
dread
of
prison
appeared
before
cardinal
bellarmine
and
declared
that
he
would
renounce
the
doctrines
he
had
defended
this
cardinal
was
not
an
ignorant
man
he
was
the
greatest
theologian
of
the
catholic
church
but
his
bitterness
and
rancor
in
reference
to
the
new
doctrines
were
as
marked
as
his
scholastic
learning
the
pope
supposing
that
galileo
would
adhere
to
his
promise
was
gracious
and
kind
but
the
philosopher
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
ridiculing
the
advocates
of
the
old
system
he
called
them
paper
philosophers
in
private
he
made
a
mockery
of
his
persecutors
one
saisi
undertook
to
prove
from
suidas
that
the
babylonians
used
to
cook
eggs
by
whirling
them
swiftly
on
a
sling
to
which
he
replied
if
saisi
insists
on
the
authority
of
suidas
that
the
babylonians
cooked
eggs
by
whirling
them
on
a
sling
i
will
believe
it
but
i
must
add
that
we
have
eggs
and
slings
and
strong
men
to
whirl
them
yet
they
will
not
become
cooked
nay
if
they
were
hot
at
first
they
more
quickly
became
cool
and
as
there
is
nothing
wanting
to
us
but
to
be
babylonians
it
follows
that
being
babylonians
is
the
true
cause
why
the
eggs
became
hard
such
was
his
prevailing
mockery
and
ridicule
your
eminence
writes
one
of
his
friends
to
the
cardinal
would
be
delighted
if
you
could
hear
him
hold
forth
in
the
midst
of
fifteen
or
twenty
all
violently
attacking
him
sometimes
in
one
house
and
sometimes
in
another
but
he
is
armed
after
such
a
fashion
that
he
laughs
them
all
to
scorn
galileo
after
his
admonition
from
the
inquisition
and
his
promise
to
hold
his
tongue
did
keep
comparatively
quiet
for
a
while
amusing
himself
with
mechanics
and
striving
to
find
out
a
new
way
of
discovering
longitude
at
sea
but
the
want
of
better
telescopes
baffled
his
efforts
and
even
it
is
said
that
no
telescope
has
yet
been
made
which
is
capable
of
observing
at
sea
the
eclipses
of
satellites
by
which
on
shore
this
method
of
finding
longitude
has
many
advantages
on
the
accession
of
a
new
pope
urban
who
had
been
his
friend
as
cardinal
barberini
galileo
after
eight
years
of
silence
thought
that
he
might
now
venture
to
publish
his
great
work
on
the
ptolemaic
and
copernican
systems
especially
as
the
papal
censor
also
had
been
his
friend
but
the
publication
of
the
book
was
delayed
nearly
two
years
so
great
were
the
obstacles
to
be
surmounted
and
so
prejudiced
and
hostile
was
the
church
to
the
new
views
at
last
it
appeared
in
florence
in
with
a
dedication
to
the
grand
duke
not
the
cosimo
who
had
rewarded
him
but
his
son
ferdinand
who
was
a
mere
youth
it
was
an
unfortunate
thing
for
galileo
to
do
he
had
pledged
his
word
not
to
advocate
the
copernican
theory
which
was
already
sufficiently
established
in
the
opinions
of
philosophers
the
form
of
the
book
was
even
offensive
in
the
shape
of
dialogues
where
some
of
the
chief
speakers
were
his
enemies
one
of
them
he
ridiculed
under
the
name
of
simplicio
this
was
supposed
to
mean
the
pope
himself
so
they
made
the
pope
believe
and
he
was
furious
old
cardinal
bellarmine
roared
like
a
lion
the
whole
church
as
represented
by
its
dignitaries
seemed
to
be
against
him
the
pope
seized
the
old
weapons
of
the
clements
and
the
gregories
to
hurl
upon
the
daring
innovator
but
delayed
to
hurl
them
since
he
dealt
with
a
giant
covered
not
only
by
the
shield
of
the
medici
but
that
of
minerva
so
he
convened
a
congregation
of
cardinals
and
submitted
to
them
the
examination
of
the
detested
book
the
author
was
summoned
to
rome
to
appear
before
the
inquisition
and
answer
at
its
the
charges
against
him
as
a
heretic
the
tuscan
ambassador
expostulated
with
his
holiness
against
such
a
cruel
thing
considering
galileo
age
infirmities
and
fame
all
to
no
avail
he
was
obliged
to
obey
the
summons
at
the
age
of
seventy
this
venerated
philosopher
infirm
in
precarious
health
appeared
before
the
inquisition
of
cardinals
not
one
of
whom
had
any
familiarity
with
abstruse
speculations
or
even
with
mathematics
whether
out
of
regard
to
his
age
and
infirmities
or
to
his
great
fame
and
illustrious
position
as
the
greatest
philosopher
of
his
day
the
cardinals
treat
galileo
with
unusual
indulgence
though
a
prisoner
of
the
inquisition
and
completely
in
its
hands
with
power
of
life
and
death
it
would
seem
that
he
is
allowed
every
personal
comfort
his
table
is
provided
by
the
tuscan
ambassador
a
servant
obeys
his
slightest
nod
he
sleeps
in
the
luxurious
apartment
of
the
fiscal
of
that
dreaded
body
he
is
even
liberated
on
the
responsibility
of
a
cardinal
he
is
permitted
to
lodge
in
the
palace
of
the
ambassador
he
is
allowed
time
to
make
his
defence
those
holy
inquisitors
would
not
unnecessarily
harm
a
hair
of
his
head
nor
was
it
probably
their
object
to
inflict
bodily
torments
these
would
call
out
sympathy
and
degrade
the
tribunal
it
was
enough
to
threaten
these
torments
to
which
they
did
not
wish
to
resort
except
in
case
of
necessity
there
is
no
evidence
that
galileo
was
personally
tortured
he
was
indeed
a
martyr
but
not
a
sufferer
except
in
humiliated
pride
probably
the
object
of
his
enemies
was
to
silence
him
to
degrade
him
to
expose
his
name
to
infamy
to
arrest
the
spread
of
his
doctrines
to
bow
his
old
head
in
shame
to
murder
his
soul
to
make
him
stab
himself
and
be
his
own
executioner
by
an
act
which
all
posterity
should
regard
as
unworthy
of
his
name
and
cause
after
a
fitting
time
has
elapsed
four
months
of
dignified
session
the
mind
of
the
holy
tribunal
is
made
up
its
judgment
is
ready
on
the
of
june
the
prisoner
appears
in
penitential
dress
at
the
convent
of
minerva
and
the
presiding
cardinal
in
his
scarlet
robes
delivers
the
sentence
of
the
court
that
galileo
as
a
warning
to
others
and
by
way
of
salutary
penance
be
condemned
to
the
formal
prison
of
the
holy
office
and
be
ordered
to
recite
once
a
week
the
seven
penitential
psalms
for
the
benefit
of
his
soul
apparently
a
light
sentence
only
to
be
nominally
imprisoned
a
few
days
and
to
repeat
those
psalms
which
were
the
life
of
blessed
saints
in
mediaeval
times
but
this
was
nothing
he
was
required
to
recant
to
abjure
the
doctrines
he
had
taught
not
in
private
but
publicly
before
the
world
will
he
recant
will
he
subscribe
himself
an
imposter
will
he
abjure
the
doctrines
on
which
his
fame
rests
oh
tell
it
not
in
gath
the
timid
infirm
old
patriarch
of
science
falls
he
is
not
great
enough
for
martyrdom
he
chooses
shame
in
an
evil
hour
this
venerable
sage
falls
down
upon
his
knees
before
the
assembled
cardinals
and
reads
aloud
this
recantation
i
galileo
galilei
aged
seventy
on
my
knees
before
you
most
reverend
lords
and
having
my
eye
on
the
holy
gospel
which
i
do
touch
with
my
lips
thus
publish
and
declare
that
i
believe
and
always
have
believed
and
always
will
believe
every
article
which
the
holy
catholic
roman
church
holds
and
teaches
and
as
i
have
written
a
book
in
which
i
have
maintained
that
the
sun
is
the
centre
which
doctrine
is
repugnant
to
the
holy
scriptures
i
with
sincere
heart
and
unfeigned
faith
do
abjure
and
detest
and
curse
the
said
error
and
heresy
and
all
other
errors
contrary
to
said
holy
church
whose
penance
i
solemnly
swear
to
observe
faithfully
and
all
other
penances
which
have
been
or
shall
be
laid
upon
me
it
would
appear
from
this
confession
that
he
did
not
declare
his
doctrines
false
only
that
they
were
in
opposition
to
the
scriptures
and
it
is
also
said
that
as
he
arose
from
his
knees
he
whispered
to
a
friend
it
does
move
nevertheless
as
some
excuse
for
him
he
acted
with
the
certainty
that
he
would
be
tortured
if
he
did
not
recant
and
at
the
worst
he
had
only
affirmed
that
his
scientific
theory
was
in
opposition
to
the
scriptures
he
had
not
denied
his
master
like
peter
he
had
not
recanted
the
faith
like
cranmer
he
had
simply
yielded
for
fear
of
bodily
torments
and
therefore
was
not
sincere
in
the
abjuration
which
he
made
to
save
his
life
nevertheless
his
recantation
was
a
fall
and
in
the
eyes
of
the
scientific
world
perhaps
greater
than
that
of
bacon
galileo
was
false
to
philosophy
and
himself
why
did
he
suffer
himself
to
be
conquered
by
priests
he
despised
why
did
so
bold
and
witty
and
proud
a
man
betray
his
cause
why
did
he
not
accept
the
penalty
of
intellectual
freedom
and
die
if
die
he
must
what
was
life
to
him
diseased
infirm
and
old
what
had
he
more
to
gain
was
it
not
a
good
time
to
die
and
consummate
his
protests
only
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
before
one
of
his
countrymen
had
accepted
torture
and
death
rather
than
recant
his
religious
opinions
why
could
not
galileo
have
been
as
great
in
martyrdom
as
savonarola
he
was
a
renowned
philosopher
and
brilliant
as
a
man
of
genius
but
he
was
a
man
of
the
world
he
loved
ease
and
length
of
days
he
could
ridicule
and
deride
opponents
he
could
not
suffer
pain
he
had
a
great
intellect
but
not
a
great
soul
there
were
flaws
in
his
morality
he
was
anything
but
a
saint
or
hero
he
was
great
in
mind
and
yet
he
was
far
from
being
great
in
character
we
pity
him
while
we
exalt
him
nor
is
the
world
harsh
to
him
it
forgives
him
for
his
services
the
worst
that
can
be
said
is
that
he
was
not
willing
to
suffer
and
die
for
his
opinions
and
how
many
philosophers
are
there
who
are
willing
to
be
martyrs
nevertheless
in
the
eyes
of
philosophers
he
has
disgraced
himself
let
him
then
return
to
florence
to
his
own
arceti
he
is
a
silenced
man
but
he
is
silenced
not
because
he
believed
with
copernicus
but
because
he
ridiculed
his
enemies
and
confronted
the
church
and
in
the
eyes
of
blinded
partisans
had
attacked
divine
authority
why
did
copernicus
escape
persecution
the
church
must
have
known
that
there
was
something
in
his
discoveries
and
in
those
of
galileo
worthy
of
attention
about
this
time
pascal
wrote
it
is
vain
that
you
have
procured
the
condemnation
of
galileo
that
will
never
prove
the
earth
to
be
at
rest
if
unerring
observation
proves
that
it
turns
round
not
all
mankind
together
can
keep
it
from
turning
or
themselves
from
turning
with
it
but
let
that
persecution
pass
it
is
no
worse
than
other
persecutions
either
in
catholic
or
protestant
ranks
it
was
no
worse
than
burning
witches
not
only
is
intolerance
in
human
nature
but
there
is
a
repugnance
among
the
learned
to
receive
new
opinions
when
these
interfere
with
their
ascendency
the
opposition
to
galileo
discoveries
was
no
greater
than
that
of
the
protestant
church
half
a
century
ago
to
some
of
the
inductions
of
geology
how
bitter
the
hatred
even
in
our
times
to
such
men
as
huxley
and
darwin
true
they
have
not
proved
their
theories
as
galileo
did
but
they
gave
as
great
a
shock
as
he
to
the
minds
of
theologians
all
science
is
progressive
yet
there
are
thousands
who
oppose
its
progress
and
if
learning
and
science
should
establish
a
different
meaning
to
certain
texts
from
which
theological
deductions
are
drawn
and
these
premises
be
undermined
there
would
be
the
same
bitterness
among
the
defenders
of
the
present
system
of
dogmatic
theology
yet
theology
will
live
and
never
lose
its
dignity
and
importance
only
some
of
its
present
assumptions
may
be
discarded
god
will
never
be
dethroned
from
the
world
he
governs
but
some
of
his
ways
may
appear
to
be
different
from
what
was
once
supposed
and
all
science
is
not
only
progressive
but
it
appears
to
be
bold
and
scornful
and
proud
at
least
its
advocates
are
and
ever
have
been
contemptuous
of
all
other
departments
of
knowledge
but
its
own
so
narrow
and
limited
is
the
human
mind
in
the
midst
of
its
triumphs
so
full
of
prejudices
are
even
the
learned
and
the
great
let
us
turn
then
to
give
another
glance
at
the
fallen
philosopher
in
his
final
retreat
at
arceti
he
lives
under
restrictions
but
they
allow
him
leisure
and
choice
wines
of
which
he
is
fond
and
gardens
and
friends
and
many
come
to
do
him
reverence
he
amuses
his
old
age
with
the
studies
of
his
youth
and
manhood
and
writes
dialogues
on
motion
and
even
discovers
the
phenomena
of
the
moon
libration
and
by
means
of
the
pendulum
he
gives
additional
importance
to
astronomical
science
but
he
is
not
allowed
to
leave
his
retirement
not
even
to
visit
his
friends
in
florence
the
wrath
of
the
inquisition
still
pursues
him
even
in
his
villa
at
arceti
in
the
suburbs
of
florence
then
renewed
afflictions
come
he
loses
his
daughter
who
was
devoted
to
him
and
her
death
nearly
plunges
him
into
despair
the
bulwarks
of
his
heart
break
down
a
flood
of
grief
overwhelms
his
stricken
soul
his
appetite
leaves
him
his
health
forsakes
him
his
infirmities
increase
upon
him
his
right
eye
loses
its
power
that
eye
that
had
seen
more
of
the
heavens
than
the
eyes
of
all
who
had
gone
before
him
he
becomes
blind
and
deaf
and
can
not
sleep
afflicted
with
rheumatic
pains
and
maladies
forlorn
no
more
for
him
is
rest
or
peace
or
bliss
still
less
the
glories
of
his
brighter
days
the
sight
of
glittering
fields
the
gems
of
heaven
without
which
neither
breath
of
morn
when
she
ascends
with
charm
of
earliest
birds
nor
rising
sun
on
this
delightful
land
nor
herb
fruit
flower
glistering
with
dew
nor
fragrance
after
showers
nor
grateful
evening
mild
is
sweet
no
more
shall
he
gaze
on
features
that
he
loves
or
stars
or
trees
or
hills
no
more
to
him
returns
day
or
the
sweet
approach
of
even
or
morn
or
sight
of
vernal
bloom
or
summer
rose
or
flocks
or
herds
or
human
face
divine
but
clouds
instead
and
dark
surround
him
it
was
in
those
dreary
desolate
days
at
arceti
unseen
in
manly
beauty
milton
stood
before
him
gazing
in
reverent
awe
milton
his
guest
just
then
come
forth
all
life
and
enterprise
while
he
in
his
old
age
exploring
with
his
staff
his
eyes
upturned
as
to
the
golden
sun
his
eyeballs
idly
rolling
this
may
have
been
the
punishment
of
his
recantation
not
inquisitorial
torture
but
the
consciousness
that
he
had
lost
his
honor
poor
galileo
thine
illustrious
visitor
when
affliction
came
could
cast
his
sightless
eyeballs
inward
and
see
and
tell
things
unattempted
yet
in
prose
or
rhyme
not
rocks
caves
lakes
bogs
fens
and
shades
of
death
where
all
life
dies
death
lives
and
nature
breeds
gorgons
and
hydras
and
chimeras
dire
but
of
eternal
providence
and
eden
with
surpassing
glory
crowned
and
our
first
parents
and
of
salvation
goodness
infinite
of
wisdom
which
when
known
we
need
no
higher
though
all
the
stars
we
know
by
name
all
secrets
of
the
deep
all
nature
works
or
works
of
god
in
heaven
or
air
or
sea
and
yet
thou
stricken
observer
of
the
heavenly
bodies
hadst
thou
but
known
what
marvels
would
be
revealed
by
the
power
of
thy
wondrous
instrument
after
thou
be
laid
lifeless
and
cold
beneath
the
marble
floor
of
sante
croce
at
the
age
of
without
a
monument
without
even
the
right
of
burial
in
consecrated
ground
having
died
a
prisoner
of
the
inquisition
yet
not
without
having
rendered
to
astronomical
science
services
of
utmost
value
even
thou
might
have
died
rejoicing
as
one
of
the
great
benefactors
of
the
world
and
thy
discoveries
shall
be
forever
held
in
gratitude
they
shall
herald
others
of
even
greater
importance

shall
prove
that
the
different

attracted
to
the

inverse

that
the
earth
has
a
force
on

identical
with
the

and
that
all
celestial

of

mutually
attract

that
all
particles

are
governed
by

law
the
great

by
which
astronomy
in
the
language
of

passed
from

to

added
more
to
the

of

than
any

distant

that
the

about
thirty
has

been
discovered
with

so
boundless
is
the

so
vast
are

that

hundred
thousand

so
marvellous
shall
be
the
victories
of
science
that
the
perturbations
of

in

courses
shall
reveal
the
existence
of
a

that

so
far
as
we
have
discovered
the
universe
which
we
have
observed
with
telescopic
instruments
has
no
limits
that
mortals
can
define
and
in
comparison
with
its
magnitude
our
earth
is
less
than
a
grain
of
sand
and
is
so
old
that
no
genius
can
calculate
and
no
imagination
can
conceive
when
it
had
a
beginning
all
that
we
know
is
that
suns
exist
at
distances
we
can
not
define
but
around
what
centre
do
they
revolve
of
what
are
they
composed
are
they
inhabited
by
intelligent
and
immortal
beings
do
we
know
that
they
are
not
eternal
except
from
the
divine
declaration
that
there
a
time
when
the
almighty
fiat
went
forth
for
this
grand
creation
creation
involves
a
creator
and
can
the
order
and
harmony
seen
in
nature
laws
exist
without
supreme
intelligence
and
power
who
then
and
what
is
god
canst
thou
by
searching
find
out
him
knowest
thou
the
ordinances
of
heaven
canst
thou
bind
the
sweet
influences
of
the
pleiades
or
loose
the
bands
of
orion
what
an
atom
is
this
world
in
the
light
of
science
yet
what
dignity
has
man
by
the
light
of
revelation
what
majesty
and
power
and
glory
has
god
what
goodness
benevolence
and
love
that
even
a
sparrow
can
not
fall
to
the
ground
without
his
notice
that
we
are
the
special
objects
of
his
providence

there
an
imagination
