rules

traced
to
their
sources
and
restored
by
moncure

inscribed
to
my
son
the
rules
of
civility
among
the
manuscript
books
of
george
washington
preserved
in
the
state
archives
at
washington
city
the
earliest
bears
the
date
written
in
it
by
himself
washington
was
born
february
so
that
while
writing
in
this
book
he
was
either
near
the
close
of
his
fourteenth
or
in
his
fifteenth
year
it
is
entitled
forms
of
writing
has
thirty
folio
pages
and
the
contents
all
in
his
boyish
handwriting
are
sufficiently
curious
amid
copied
forms
of
exchange
bonds
receipts
sales
and
similar
exercises
occasionally
in
ornate
penmanship
there
are
poetic
selections
among
them
lines
of
a
religious
tone
on
true
happiness
but
the
great
interest
of
the
book
centres
in
the
pages
headed
rules
of
civility
and
decent
behaviour
in
company
and
conversation
the
book
had
been
gnawed
at
the
bottom
by
mount
vernon
mice
before
it
reached
the
state
archives
and
nine
of
the
rules
have
thus
suffered
the
sense
of
several
being
lost
the
rules
possess
so
much
historic
interest
that
it
seems
surprising
that
none
of
washington
biographers
or
editors
should
have
given
them
to
the
world
washington
irving
in
his
life
of
washington
excites
interest
in
them
by
a
tribute
but
does
not
quote
even
one
sparks
quotes
but
inexactly
and
with
his
usual
literary
manipulation
these
were
reprinted
by
stoddard
at
denver
colorado
and
in
hale
washington
i
suspect
that
the
old
biographers
more
eulogistic
than
critical
feared
it
would
be
an
ill
service
to
washington
fame
to
print
all
of
the
rules
there
might
be
a
scandal
in
the
discovery
that
the
military
and
political
deity
of
america
had
even
in
boyhood
written
so
gravely
of
the
deference
due
to
lords
and
other
persons
of
quality
or
had
concerned
himself
with
things
so
trivial
as
the
proper
use
of
the
fork
napkin
and
toothpick
something
is
said
too
about
inferiours
before
whom
one
must
not
act
rules
moral
but
in
the
rules
were
subjected
to
careful
and
literal
treatment
by
toner
of
washington
city
in
the
course
of
his
magnanimous
task
of
preserving
in
the
library
of
congress
by
exact
copies
the
early
and
perishing
and
journals
of
washington
this
able
literary
antiquarian
has
printed
his
transcript
of
the
rules
morrison
washington
and
the
pamphlet
though
little
known
to
the
general
public
is
much
valued
by
students
of
american
history
with
the
exception
of
one
word
to
which
he
called
my
attention
toner
has
given
as
exact
a
reproduction
of
the
rules
in
their
present
damaged
condition
as
can
be
made
in
print
the
illegible
parts
are
precisely
indicated
without
any
conjectural
insertions
and
young
washington
spelling
and
punctuation
subjected
to
no
literary
tampering
concerning
the
source
of
these
remarkable
rules
there
have
been
several
guesses
washington
irving
suggests
that
it
was
probably
his
intercourse
with
the
fairfax
family
and
his
ambition
to
acquit
himself
well
in
their
society
that
set
him
upon
compiling
a
code
of
morals
and
manners
knickerbocker
ed
p
sparks
more
cautiously
says
the
most
remarkable
part
of
the
book
is
that
in
which
is
compiled
a
system
of
maxims
and
regulations
of
conduct
drawn
from
miscellaneous
sources
p
toner
says
having
searched
in
vain
to
find
these
rules
in
print
i
feel
justified
considering
all
the
circumstances
in
assuming
that
they
were
compiled
by
george
washington
himself
when
a
schoolboy
but
while
making
this
claim
it
is
proper
to
state
that
nearly
all
the
principles
incorporated
and
injunctions
given
in
these
maxims
had
been
enunciated
over
and
over
again
in
the
various
works
on
good
behaviour
and
manners
prior
to
this
compilation
and
for
centuries
observed
in
polite
society
it
will
be
noticed
that
while
the
spirit
of
these
maxims
is
drawn
chiefly
from
the
social
life
of
europe
yet
as
formulated
here
they
are
as
broad
as
civilization
itself
though
a
few
of
them
are
especially
applicable
to
society
as
it
then
existed
in
america
and
also
that
but
few
refer
to
women
except
for
the
word
parents
which
occurs
twice
toner
might
have
said
that
the
rules
contain
no
allusion
whatever
to
the
female
sex
this
alone
proved
to
my
own
mind
that
washington
was
in
nowise
responsible
for
these
rules
in
the
school
he
was
attending
when
they
were
written
there
were
girls
and
as
he
was
rather
precocious
in
his
admirations
a
compilation
of
his
own
could
hardly
omit
all
consideration
of
conduct
towards
ladies
or
in
their
presence
there
were
other
reasons
also
which
led
me
to
dissent
from
my
friend
toner
in
this
instance
and
to
institute
a
search
which
has
proved
successful
for
the
source
of
the
rules
of
civility
while
gathering
materials
for
a
personal
and
domestic
biography
of
washington
i
discovered
that
in
he
was
attending
school
in
fredericksburg
virginia
the
first
church
george
of
the
infant
town
was
just
then
finished
and
the
clergyman
was
the
rev
james
marye
a
native
of
france
it
is
also
stated
in
the
municipal
records
of
the
town
that
its
first
school
was
taught
by
french
people
and
it
is
tolerably
certain
that
marye
founded
the
school
soon
after
his
settlement
there
as
rector
which
was
in
eight
years
after
the
foundation
of
fredericksburg
i
was
thus
led
to
suspect
a
french
origin
of
the
rules
of
civility
this
conjecture
i
mentioned
to
my
friend
garnett
of
the
british
museum
and
on
his
suggestion
explored
an
old
work
in
french
and
latin
in
which
of
the
rules
were
found
this
interesting
discovery
and
others
to
which
it
led
enable
me
to
restore
the
damaged
manuscript
to
completeness

the

intrinsic

severe
on
the
french
of
the
la

pensionnaires
it
is
a
novelty
surprising
enough
to
find
a
very
unpolished
french
book
translated
into
the
most
elegant
latin
ever
met
with
de
bresche
declares
that
he
was
no
longer
able
to
leave
so
beautiful
a
work
in
such
abjection
and
had
added
a
translation
which
preserves
the
purity
of
the
french
tongue
and
is
proportioned
to
the
merit
of
the
exquisite
latin
expressions
we
can
hardly
suppose
that
pierre
de
bresche
was
eulogising
his
own
work
but
there
is
no
other
name
in
the
book
possibly
his
criticism
on
the
french
of
the
original
edition
was
only
that
of
an
desiring
to
supplant
it
at
any
rate
as
father
périn
wrote
the
elegant
latin
we
can
not
doubt
that
the
chapter
he
added
to
the
book
was
in
scholarly
french
the
old
book
of
the
jesuit
pensionnaires
which
had
they
not
ignored
woman
might
be
called
the
mother
of
all
works
on
civility
is
charming
as
well
as
curious
it
duly
opens
with
a
chapter
of
religious
proprieties
at
mass
sacrament
sermon
and
grace
at
meat
the
maxims
of
secular
civility
open
with
the
second
chapter
and
it
will
be
seen
that
they
are
for
the
gentry
they
are
mainly
for
youths
whose
environments
are
portrayed
in
the
interesting
frontispiece
of
the
work
where
they
are
seen
in
compartments
at
church
in
college
in
conversation
at
the
fireside
in
promenade
and
at
table
we
have
already
seen
from
backer
jesuit
bibliography
that
father
léonard
périn
added
a
chapter
on
bienséance
at
table
but
after
this
there
is
another
chapter
a
wonderful
chapter
and
it
would
be
interesting
to
learn
whether
we
owe
this
also
to
périn
this
last
chapter
is
exquisitely
epicurean
dealing
with
and
the
proper
order
of
entrees
roasts
salads
and
dessert
it
closes
and
the
book
closes
with
a
sort
of
sugarplum
paean
the
sweets
and
spices
being
in
the
end
gracefully
spiritualised
but
this
concluding
passage
of
chapter
xi

must
be
quoted
complete
the
pleasantness
and
enjoyment
of

are
brought
while
the
table
is
still
laid
in
a
handsome
box
on
a
salver
like
those
given
by
the
ancients
to
be
carried
home
sometimes
also
they
are
handed
round
after
the
hands
have
been
washed
in

which
we

not
terminate
more
agreeably
in

than
with
our

the
exquisite
delicacy
of
their
sugar
cinnamon
and
aniseed
they
possess
a
sweet
fragrant
odour
like
the
breeze
of
the

that
is
to
say
like
our
sincerest
attachment

order
to
devote
ourselves
more
zealously
to
other
duties
which
will
contribute
to
your
satisfaction
and
prove
agreeable
to
all
those
who
truly
esteem
and
decent
general

the

they
were
used

much
about

largely

that
the

was
not

my
theory
that

has
done
good
service
in
leading
to
the

it

verified
unless
the

have
preserved
papers
in
which
they
can
be

i
have
since
learned
from

that
no

exist

discovery
just
mentioned
that
a
part
second
of
youth
behaviour
was
published
in
and
dedicated
to
two
ladies
of
the
washington
family
in
england
lends
force
to
suggestion
that
washington
might
have
worked
out
his
rules
from
the
hawkins
version
it
would
be
natural
that
part
ii
so
dedicated
should
be
preserved
in
the
virginia
family
and
should
be
bound
up
with
part
published
the
year
before
as
it
is
bound
in
the
british
museum
it
is
certain
that
one
of
the
later
editions
of
the
hawkins
version
was
used
in
the
preparation
of
washington
rules
for
the
eighteen
rules
not
in
the
french
book
are
all
from
youth
behaviour

the
phraseology
is
sometimes
the

in
the

a
careful
comparison
however
of
washington
rules
with
the
hawkins
version
renders
it
doubtful
whether
the
virginia
boy
used
the
work
of
the
london
boy
the
differences
are
more
than
the
resemblances
if
in
some
cases
the
faults
of
the
washington
version
appear
gratuitous
the
printed
copy
being
before
him
on
the
other
hand
it
often
suggests
a
closer
approach
to
the
french
of
which
language
washington
is
known
to
have
been
totally
ignorant
as
to
the
faults
where
hawkins
says
ceremonies
are
too
troublesome
washington
says
they
is
troublesome
where
the
former
translates
correctly
that
one
must
not
approach
where
another
readeth
a
letter
washington
has
is
writing
a
letter
where
he
writes
infirmityes
washington
has
infirmaties
the
printed
manful
becomes
manfull
and
courtesy
curtesie
among
the
variations
which
suggest
a
more
intimate
knowledge
of
french
idioms
than
that
of
hawkins
the
following
may
be
mentioned
the
first
maxim
with
which
both
versions
open
is
que
toutes
actions
qui
se
font
publiquement
fassent

son
sentiment
respectueux

hawkins
every
action
done

of

ought
to
be
accompanied

some
signe

reverence
which
one

all

present
washington
every
action
done
in

ought
to
be
with
some
sign
of
respect
to
those
that
are
present
here
the
restoration
of
respectueux
and
the
limitation
of
publiquement

make
the
latter
rendering
much
neater
in
maxim

which
admonishes

said

if
you
deliver
anything
witty
and
pleasent
abtain
from
laughing
thereat
yourself
yet
how
curt
is
the
version
last
quoted
and
how
blundering
the
sentence
washington
spelling
was
always
faulty
but
it
is
not
characteristic
of
him
to
write
abtain
for
abstain
this
is
one
of
many
signs
of
haste
suggesting
that
his
pen
was
following
oral
instruction
the
absence
of
punctuation
is
normal
in
some
cases
words
have
dropped
out
such
clerical
mistakes
occur
as
eys
but
for
put
top
for
of
whth
for
without
and
affection
for
affectation
the
needed
letters
being
in
the
last
case
interlined
except
as
regards
punctuation
no
similar
errors
occur
in
any
manuscript
from
washington
hand
either
in
youth
or
age
another
reason
for
supposing
that
he
may
have
been
following
an
instructor
is
the
excessive
abbreviation
it
was
by
no
means
characteristic
of
washington
to
suppress
details
but
here
his
condensation
sometimes
deprives
maxims
of
something
of
their
force
if
not
of
their
sense
rule
never
express
anything
unbecoming
nor
act
against
the
rules
moral
before
your
inferiours
hawkins
never
expresse
anything
unbeseeming
nor
act
against
the
rules
morall
before
thy
inferiours
for
in
these
things
thy
own
guilt
will
multiply
crimes
by
example
and
as
it
were
confirme
ill
by
authority
and
shift
not
yourself
in
the
sight
of
others
hardly
does
duty
for
the
precept
it
is
insufferable
impoliteness
to
stretch
the
body
extend
the
arms
and
assume
different
postures
there
are
however
but
few
instances
in
which
the
sense
of
the
original
has
been
lost
indeed
the
rendering
of
the
washington
is
generally
an
improvement
on
the
original
which
is
too
diffuse
and
even
more
an
improvement
on
the
hawkins
version
indeed
although
washington
was
precocious
a
surveyor
at
seventeen
it
would
argue
qualities
not
hitherto
ascribed
to
him
were
we
to
suppose
that
along
with
his
faulty
grammar
and
spelling
he
was
competent
at
fourteen
for
such
artistic
selection
and
prudent
omission
as
are
shown
by
a
comparison
of
his
rules
with
the
much
longer
ones
of
the
english
version
the
omission
of
religious
passages
save
the
very
general
ones
with
which
the
rules
close
and
of
all
scriptural
ones
is
equally
curious
whether
we
refer
the
rules
to
young
washington
or
to
the
rector
who
taught
him
but
it
would
be
of
some
significance
if
we
suppose
the
boy
to
have
omitted
the
precept
to
live
peeceably
in
that
vocation
unto
which
providence
hath
called
thee
and
still
more
that
he
should
have
derived
nothing
from
the
following
do
not
think
thou
canst
be
a
friend
to
the
king
whilst
thou
art
an
enemy
to
god
if
thy
crying
iniquity
should
invite
god
judgments
to
the
court
it
would
cost
thy
soveraigne
dear
to
give
them
entertainment
if
washington
was
acquainted
with
part
ii
of
youth
behaviour
relating
to
women
and
dedicated
to
ladies
of
the
washington
race
it
is
remarkable
that
no
word
relating
to
that
sex
is
found
among
his
rules

have
belonged
to
the

family
as
the
huguenot
martyr
marin
marie
a
native
of
george
in
the
diocese
of
lisieux
it
was
in
the
year
that
that
valiant
man
who
had
become
a
settler
in
geneva
was
arrested
at
sens
when
on
a
missionary
journey
to
france
laden
with
a
bale
of
bibles
and
new
testaments
and
publications
for
the
promotion
of

protestant
reformation
he
was
burnt
at
paris
in
the
place
maubert
on
the
of
august
of
that
year
our
pasteur
was
well
received
in
england
and
was
sent
to
norwich
of
which
city
he
appears
to
have
been
the
first
french
minister
he
was
lent
to
the
reformed
churches
of
france
when
liberty
of
preaching
revived
and
so
returned
to
normandy
where
we
find
him
in

upon
its

because
of
the
great
success
of
his

in
these
parts
his
church
may
be
entreated
to
continue
for
some
longer
time
his
absence
from
it
he
certainly
did
return

on

we
are
particularly
concerned
sprang
from
the
catholic
family
and
was
born
at
rouen
near
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
he
was
educated
for
the
priesthood
no
doubt
at
the
jesuit
college
in
rouen
where
as
we
have
seen
father
périn
book
on
manners
was
printed
in
however
james
marye
abjured
the
catholic
religion
in
this
caused
a
breach
between
himself
and
the
family
which
consisted
of
a
widowed
mother
and
her
two
other
sons
peter
and
william
the
latter
an
officer
both
of
whose
names
however
reappeared
in
their
protestant
brother
family
in
consequence
of
this
alienation
james
migrated
to
england
where
he
pursued
his
studies
and
was
ordained
by
the
bishop
of

in

was

colony

rev
james
marye
also
embarked
in
with
his
bride
their
first
child
lucy
was
born
during
the
voyage
it
would
appear
that
the
purpose
of
this
emigration
was
to
minister
to
a
settlement
of
french
huguenots
at
monacan
or
manakintown
as
it
was
called
on
james
river
the
first
band
of
these
refugees
had
gone
over
in
under
the
leadership
of
olivier
de
la
muce
and
others
had
followed
in
with
their
clergyman
phillipe
de

the
assembly
of

gave
them
a
large
tract
of
land
in
henrico
county
not
far
from
where
richmond
now
stands
exempting
them
from
taxation
the
name
of
james
marye
first
appears
in
virginia
as
christening
a
child
in
king
william

as
it
was
called
after
the
king
who
had
favoured
this

founded

one

a

a

an

a

who
acts
both
as

this
willis
had
married
washington
aunt
and
godmother
and
there
were
other
families
of
the
neighbourhood
connected
with
the
washingtons
it
was
not
until
that
captain
augustine
washington
the
general
father
went
to
reside
near
fredericksburg
soon
after
the
birth
of
george
old
style
the
family
left
their
homestead
in
westmoreland
county
virginia
and
resided
on
their
farm
now
known
as
mount
vernon
it
was
so
named
by
elder
lawrence
who
built
the
mansion
in
in
honour
of
the
english
admiral
vernon
with
whom
he
served
as
an
officer
at
carthagena
although
he
nowhere
alludes
to
the
fact
george
washington
earliest
memories
as
i
have
elsewhere
shown
were
associated
with
the
estate
on
which
he
lavished
so
much
devotion
and
which
the
ladies
mount
vernon
association
has
made
his
most
characteristic
monument
the
rev
jonathan
boucher
teacher
of
george
washington
son
john
custis
says
that
washington
was
taught
by
a
convict
servant
whom
his
father
had
bought
for
a
schoolmaster
this
was
probably
one
of
a
shipload
of
convicts
brought
by
captain
augustine
washington
from
england
in
when
the
family
removed
to
the
neighbourhood
of
fredericksburg
from
which
however
they
were
separated
by
the
rappahannock
river
the
children
went
to
school
probably
at
falmouth
a
village
fifty
years
older
than
fredericksburg
and
about
two
miles
above
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
a
church
had
been
erected
in
falmouth
brunswick
parish
but
that
in
fredericksburg
was
not
completed
until
some
years
later
after
the
death
of
his
father
april
george
was
sent

i
have
from
john
marye
sometime
of
virginia
he
says
as
to
the
habit
of
the
parish
minister
to
conduct
or
overlook
the
schools
it
would
appear
must
probable
that
this
was
the
case
in
when
we
remember
how
destitute
at
that
era
colonial
society
was
of
public
or
private
schools
save
the
tutors
in

i
entered

was
the
custom
of
parson
mcguire
and
some
of
the
vestry
to
attend
the
annual
examinations
some
of
the
rules
may
strike
the
modern
reader
as
snobbish
even
for
the
observance
of
youth
but
the
originals
are
in
that
respect
toned
down
in
washington
rule
takes
no
cognizance
of
the
principle
of
the
original
that
to
approach
nearer
the
fire
than
others
and
to
turn
one
back
to
it
are
privileges
of
persons
of
rank

maxim
of

which
directed
certain
kissings
of
the
hands
of
superiors
or
of
the
robe
and
other
abasements
is
entirely
omitted
where
the
original
commands
that
we
should
never
dispute
in
any
fashion
with
our
superiors
in
rank
rule
says
we
ought
not
to
begin
with
them
the
only
thing
clear
about
which
is
that
the
instructor
did
not
wish
to
admit
authority
so
absolutely
into
the
realm
of
argument
rule
omits
so
much
of
the
original
as
counsels
grateful
acceptance
of
reproof
from
another
the
more
if
you
depend
on
his
authority
other
instances
of
this
more
liberal
tendency
will
be
noticed
by
those
who
make
a
careful
comparison
of
the
rules
and
the
french
maxims
here
then
are
rules
of
conduct
taught
if
my
theory
be
correct
by
a
french
protestant
pilgrim
unknown
to
fame
in
the
new
world
they
were
taught
to
a
small
school
of
girls
and
boys
in
a
town
of
hardly
a
hundred
inhabitants
they
are
maxims
partly
ethical
but
mainly
relate
to
manners
and
civility
they
are
wise
gentle
and
true
a
character
built
on
them
would
be
virtuous
and
probably
great
the
publisher
of
the
english
version
says
that
pinchester
a
learned
scholar
of
oxford
bought
copies
for
a
great
school
he
was
about
to
open
in
london
probably
the
school
founded
by
james
marye
was
the
first
in
the
new
world
in
which
good
manners
were
seriously
taught
nay
where
is
there
any
such
school
to

footnote
it
is
probable
that
marye
fine
precedent
was
followed
to
some
extent
in
the
fredericksburg
academy
the
present
writer
who
entered
it
just
a
hundred
years
after
george
washington
recorded
the
rules
recalls
as
his
first
clear
remembrance
of
the
school
some
words
of
the
worthy
principal
thomas
hanson
on
gentlemanly
behaviour
alluding
to
some
former
pupil
who
had
become
distinguished
he
said
i
remember
on
one
occasion
in
a
room
where
all
were
gathered
around
the
fire
the
weather
being
very
cold
that
some
one
entered
and
this
boy
promptly
arose
and
gave
the
his
seat
at
the
fire
it
made
an
impression
on
me
which
i
have
never
forgotten
and
how
long
have
lasted
in
the
memory
of
the
writer
hereof
the
very
words
of
our
teacher
homage
to
the
considerate
boy
who
obeyed
washington
eighth
rule
just
this
one
colonial
school
by
the
good
fortune
of
having
for
its
master
or
superintendent
an
french
scholar
we
may
suppose
instructed
in
civility
and
out
of
that
school
in
what
was
little
more
than
a
village
came
an
exceptionally
large
number
of
eminent
men
in
that
school
three
american
presidents
received
their
early
education
washington
madison
and
monroe
it
may
be
pretty
confidently
stated
that
both
madison
and
monroe
owed
their
success
and
eminence
more
to
their
engaging
manners
than
to
great
intellectual
powers
they
were
even
notably
deficient
in
that
oratorical
ability
which
counted
for
so
much
in
the
political
era
with
which
they
were
connected
they
rarely
spoke
in
congress
when
speaking
madison
was
hesitating
and
was
heard
with
difficulty
but
his
quietness
and
modesty
his
consideration
for
others
made
the
eloquent
speak
for
him
whether
these
two
statesmen
were
personally
taught
by
james
marye
is
doubtful
for
he
was
getting
old
when
they
were
at
school
in
fredericksburg
but
we
may
feel
sure
that
civility
was
still
taught
there
in
their
time
as
indeed
it
was
within
the
memory
of
many
now
living
george
washington
though
even
less
able
than
the
two
others
to
speak
in
public
had
naturally
a
strong
intellect
but
in
boyhood
he
had
much
more
against
him
than
most
of
his
young
comrades
obstructions
that
could
be
surmounted
only
by
character
his
father
had
much
land
but
little
money
at
his
death
the
lands
were
left
chiefly
to
his
sons
by
the
first
wife
his
widow
was
left
poor
and
her
eldest
son
george
had
not
the
fair
prospect
of
most
of
his
schoolmates
instead
of
being
prepared
for
william
and
mary
college
he
was
prepared
only
for
going
into
some
business
as
soon
as
possible
so
as
to
earn
support
for
his
mother
and
her
four
younger
children
in
his
old
book
of
the
rules
of
civility
are
found
in
proximity
to
business
forms
that
bear
pathetic
testimony
to
the
severe
outlook
of
this
boy
of
fourteen
in
the
of
byrd
willis
already
referred
to
loaned
me
by
his
granddaughter
tayloe
of
fredericksburg
he
says
my
father
lewis
willis
was
a
schoolmate
of
general
washington
his
cousin
who
was
two
years
his
senior
he
spoke
of
the
industry
and
assiduity
at
school
as
very
remarkable
whilst
his
brother
and
other
boys
at
playtime
were
at
bandy
and
other
games
he
was
behind
the
door
ciphering
but
one
youthful
ebullition
is
handed
down
while
at
that
school
and
that
was
romping
with
one
of
the
largest
girls
this
was
so
unusual
that
it
excited
no
little
comment
among
the
other
lads
it
is
also
handed
down
that
in
boyhood
this
great
soldier
though
never
a
prig
had
no
fights
and
was
often
summoned
to
the
playground
as
a
peacemaker
his
arbitration
in
disputes
being
always
accepted
once
more
it
may
be
well
enough
to
remind
the
reader
that
it
may
yet
be
found
that
washington
in
his
mother
humble
home
on
the
rappahannock
read
and
pondered
youth
behaviour
wrote
out
what
it
held
for
him
and
himself
became
an
instructor
of
his
schoolmates
in
rules
of
civility
it
would
be
wonderful
but
not
incredible
although
washington
became
a
man
he
was
not
of
prepossessing
appearance
in
early
life
he
was
lank
and
he
was
by
no
means
a
favourite
with
the
beauties
for
which
fredericksburg
was
always
famous
and
had
a
cruel
disappointment
of
his
early
love
for
betsy
fauntleroy
in
his
youth
he
became
pitted
by
smallpox
while
attending
his
invalid
lawrence
on
a
visit
to
the
barbadoes
but
the
experienced
eye
of
lord
fairfax
and
of
other
members
of
the
fairfax
family
had
discovered
beneath
the
unattractive
appearance
of
george
washington
a
sterling
character
their
neighbourhood
on
the
upper
potomac
was
much
less
civilised
and
refined
than
fredericksburg
and
this
young
gentleman
so
well
instructed
in
right
rules
of
behaviour
and
conduct
won
their
hearts
and
their
confidence
it
had
been
necessary
that
he
should
leave
school
at
the
age
of
sixteen
to
earn
a
living
at
seventeen
he
was
appointed
by
lord
fairfax
surveyor
of
his
vast
estates
in
virginia
and
for
a
time
he
resided
with
his
lordship
at
greenway
court
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
it
was
partly
through
the
training
in
manners
which
washington
gained
from
the
old
french
maxims
that
he
thus
made
headway
against
circumstances
and
gained
the
friendship
of
the
and
powerful
fairfax
family
it
should
be
mentioned
however
that
young
washington
head
was
not
in
the
least
turned
by
this
intimacy
with
the
aristocracy
he
wrote
letters
to
his
former
playmates
in
which
no
snobbish
line
is
discoverable
he
writes
to
his
dear
friend
robin
my
place
of
residence
is
at
present
at
his
lordship
where
i
might
was
my
heart
disengaged
pass
my
time
very
pleasantly
as
there
a
very
agreeable
young
lady
lives
in
the
same
house
george
fairfax
wife
sister
but
as
that
only
adding
fuel
to
fire
it
makes
me
the
more
uneasy
for
by
often
and
unavoidably
being
in
company
with
her
revives
my
former
passion
for
your
lowland
beauty
whereas
was
i
to
live
more
retired
from
young
women
i
might
eleviate
in
some
measure
my
sorrows
by
burying
that
chaste
and
troublesome
passion
in
the
grave
of
oblivion
or
etearnall
forgetfulness
for
as
i
am
very
well
assured
that
the
only
antidote
or
remedy
that
i
ever
shall
be
relieved
by
or
only
recess
that
can
administer
any
cure
or
help
to
me
as
i
am
well
convinced
was
i
ever
to
attempt
anything
i
should
only
get
a
denial
which
would
be
only
adding
grief
to
uneasiness
the
young
lady
at
greenway
court
was
mary
gary
and
the
lowland
beauty
was
betsy
fauntleroy
whose
hand
washington
twice
sought
but
who
became
the
wife
of
the
hon
thomas
adams
while
travelling
on
his
surveys
often
among
the
red
men
the
youth
sometimes
gives
vent
to
his
feelings
in
verse
oh
ye
gods
why
should
my
poor
resistless
heart
stand
to
oppose
thy
might
and
power
at
last
surrender
to
cupid
feather
dart
and
now
lays
bleeding
every
hour
for
her
that
pityless
of
my
grief
and
woes
and
will
not
on
me
pity
take
i
sleep
among
my
most
inveterate
foes
and
with
gladness
never
wish
to
wake
in
deluding
sleepings
let
my
eyelids
close
that
in
an
enraptured
dream
i
may
in
a
rapt
lulling
sleep
and
gentle
repose
possess
those
joys
denied
by
day
and
it
must
also
be
recorded
that
if
he
had
learned
how
to
conduct
himself
in
the
presence
of
persons
superior
to
himself
in
position
age
and
culture
and
it
will
be
remembered
that
lord
fairfax
was
an
able
contributor
to
the
spectator
which
washington
was
careful
to
study
while
at
greenway
this
youth
no
less
followed
the
instruction
of
his
rule
honour
your
natural
parents
though
they
be
poor
his
widowed
mother
was
poor
and
she
was
ignorant
but
he
was
devoted
to
her
being
reverential
and
gracious
to
her
even
when
with
advancing
age
she
became
somewhat
morose
and
exacting
while
he
was
loaded
with
public
cares
i
am
no
worshipper
of
washington
but
in
the
hand
of
that
man
of
strong
brain
and
powerful
passions
once
lay
the
destiny
of
the
new
world
in
a
sense
human
destiny
but
for
his
possession
of
the
humility
and
underlying
his
rules
of
civility
the
ambitious
politicians
of
the
united
states
might
be
popularly
held
to
a
much
lower
standard
the
tone
of
his
character
was
so
entirely
that
of
modesty
he
was
so
fundamentally
patriotic
that
even
his
faults
are
transformed
to
virtues
and
the
very
failures
of
his
declining
years
are
popularly
accounted
successes
he
alone
was
conscious
of
his
mental
decline
and
gave
this
as
a
reason
for
not
accepting
a
third
nomination
for
the
presidency
this
humility
has
established
an
unwritten
law
of
limitation
on
vaulting
presidential
ambitions
indeed
intrigue
and
corruption
in
america
must
ever
struggle
with
the
idealised
phantom
of
this
grand
personality
these
rules
of
civility
go
forth
with
the
hope
that
they
will
do
more
than
amuse
the
reader
by
their
quaintness
and
that
their
story
will
produce
an
impression
beyond
that
of
its
picturesqueness
the
strong
probabilities
that
they
largely
moulded
the
character
of
washington
and
so
influenced
the
human
race
may
raise
the
question
whether
the
old
french
jesuits
and
the
pilgrim
james
marye
did
not
possess
more
truly
than
our
contemporary
educators
the
art
and
mystery
of
moral
education
in
these
days
when
ethical
is
replacing
theological
instruction
in
the
home
and
in
the
school
there
appears
danger
that
it
may
repeat
some
of
the
mistakes
of
its
predecessor
the
failure
of
what
was
called
religion
to
promote
moral
culture
is
now
explicable
its
scheme
of
terror
and
hope
appealed
to
and
powerfully
stimulated
selfishness
and
was
also
fundamentally
cultivating
alienation
of
all
who
did
not
hold
certain
dogmas
the
terrors
and
hopes
having
faded
away
the
selfishness
they
developed
remains
and
is
only
unchained
by
the
decay
of
superstition
on
the
other
hand
the
social
sentiment
has
thrown
off
sectarian
restrictions
and
an
enthusiasm
of
humanity
has
succeeded
it
is
now
certain
that
the
social
instinct
is
the
only
one
which
can
be
depended
on
to
influence
conduct
to
an
extent
comparable
with
the
sway
once
exercised
by
superstitious
terrors
and
expectations
of
celestial
reward
the
child
is
spiritually
a
creation
of
the
commune
there
can
be
no
other
motive
so
early
responsive
as
that
which
desires
the
approval
and
admiration
of
those
by
whom
it
is
surrounded
to
attempt
the
training
of
human
character
by
means
of
ethical
philosophy
or
moral
science
as
it
used
to
be
called
appears
to
be
somewhat
of
a
theological
survival
when
the
sanctions
of
authority
were
removed
from
the
pagan
deities
they
were
found
to
have
been
long
reduced
in
the
nursery
to
the
dimensions
of
fairies
the
tremendous
conceptions
of
christian
theology
may
some
day
be
revealed
as
similarly
diminished
in
the
catechised
mind
of
childhood
and
the
abstract
principles
of
ethical
philosophy
can
not
hope
for
any
better
fate
the
child
mind
can
not
receive
the
metaphysics
of
virtue
it
is
impossible
to
explain
to
a
child
for
instance
the
reasons
for
truthfulness
which
indeed
have
grown
out
of
the
experience
of
the
human
race
as
matured
by
many
ages
and
so
of
humanity
to
animals
which
is
mainly
a
darwinian
revival
of
buddhist
sentiment
based
on
a
doctrine
of
transmigration
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
other
virtues
we
must
not
suppose
that
a
child
has
no
scepticism
because
he
can
not
express
or
explain
it
in
words
it
will
appear
in
the
sweetness
to
him
of
stolen
apples
in
the
fact
that
to
label
a
thing
naughty
may
only
render
it
more
tempting
to
a
healthy
boy
a
philosopher
said
a
fence
is
the
temptation
to
a
jump
our
ethical
teaching
is
vitiated
by
an
inheritance
from
theology
of
a
superstition
which
subordinates
conduct
to
its
motives
really
if
conduct
be
good
the
motive
generally
too
complex
for
even
consciousness
to
analyse
is
of
least
importance
motives
are
important
as
causing
conduct
but
the
law
is
just
in
assuming
good
or
bad
motives
for
the
corresponding
actions
the
world
does
not
depend
on
a
inner
but
on
his
outer
life
emerson
once
scandalised
some
of
his
admirers
by
saying
that
he
preferred
a
person
who
did
not
respect
the
truth
to
an
unpresentable
person
but
no
doubt
he
would
regard
the
presentable
person
as
possessing
virtues
of
equal
importance
the
nurture
of
civility
and
decent
behaviour
in
company
and
conversation
is
not
of
secondary
but
primary
importance
for
what
does
it
imply
if
the
rules
about
to
be
submitted
are
examined
it
will
be
found
that
their
practice
draws
on
the
whole
moral
world
as
in
walking
every
step
draws
on
the
universal
gravitation
scarcely
one
rule
is
there
that
does
not
involve
modesty
habitual
consideration
of
others
and
to
a
large
extent
living
for
others
yet
other
rules
draw
on
the
profounder
deeps
of
wisdom
and
virtue
under
a
subtle
guise
of
handsome
behaviour
if
youth
can
be
won
to
excellence
by
love
of
beauty
who
shall
gainsay
it
may
occur
to
the
polished
reader
that
youths
know
and
practise
these
rules
of
civility
by
instinct
but
the
best
bred
ancestors
had
to
learn
them
and
the
rude
progenitors
of
future
gentlemen
have
to
learn
them
can
it
be
said
however
that
those
deemed
do
really
know
and
practise
these
rules
of
civility
instinctively
do
they
practise
them
when
out
of
the
region
of
the
persons
or
the
community
in
whose
eyes
they
wish
to
find
approval
how
do
they
act
with
indians
negroes
or
when
travelling
amongst
those
to
whose
good
opinion
they
are
indifferent
in
a
kentucky
court
a
witness
who
had
spoken
of
a
certain
man
as
a
gentleman
was
pressed
for
his
reasons
and
answered
if
any
man
goes
to
his
house
he
sets
out
the
whisky
then
goes
and
looks
out
of
the
window
it
is
doubtful
if
what
commonly
passes
for
politeness
in
more
refined
regions
is
equally
humanised
with
that
of
the
kentuckian
so
described
indeed
the
only
difficulty
in
the
way
of
such
teaching
as
is
here
suggested
is
the
degree
to
which
the
words
lady
and
gentleman
have
been
lowered
from
their
original
dignity
the
utilization
of
the
social
sentiment
as
a
motive
of
conduct
in
the
young
need
not
however
depend
on
such
terms
though
these
are
by
no
means
beyond
new
moralization
in
any
home
or
school
an
eminent
englishman
told
me
that
he
once
found
his
little
son
pointing
an
old
pistol
at
his
sister
the
ancient
pistol
was
not
dangerous
but
the
action
was
had
i
told
him
it
was
dangerous
he
said
it
might
only
have
added
spice
to
the
thing
but
i
said
am
surprised
i
thought
you
were
a
little
gentleman
but
that
is
the
most
ungentlemanly
thing
you
could
do
the
boy
quickly
laid
aside
the
pistol
with
deep
shame
i
have
found
nothing
so
restraining
for
my
children
as
to
suggest
that
any
conduct
is
ungentlemanly
or
unladylike
and
let
my
reader
note
well
the
great
moral
principles
in
these
rules
of
civility
and
decent
behaviour
the
antithesis
of
sinfull
is
manfull
washington
was
taught
that
all
good
conduct
was
gentlemanly
all
bad
conduct
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
time
is
not
far
distant
when
in
every
school
right
rules
of
civility
will
be
taught
as
a
main
part
of
the
curriculum
something
of
the
kind
was
done
by
the
late
bronson
alcott
in
the
school
he
founded
in
boston
massachusetts
near
fifty
years
ago
for
children
gathered
from
the
street
the
school
was
opened
every
morning
with
a
conduct
lesson
as
it
was
called
it
will
be
seen
by
miss
elizabeth
peabody
records
of
a
school
that
the
children
crowded
to
the
door
before
it
was
opened
in
their
anxiety
not
to
lose
a
word
of
this
lesson
and
rude
as
most
of
the
children
were
this
instruction
consisting
of
questions
and
answers
gradually
did
away
with
all
necessity
for
corporal
punishments
it
were
a
noble
task
for
any
competent
hand
to
adapt
the
rules
given
in
this
volume
and
those
of
the
later
french
work
and
still
more
those
of
master
obadiah
walker

on
education

the
conditions
and
ideas
of
our
time
for
the
use
of
schools
from
the
work
that
of
a
master
of
university
college
oxford
i
will
take
for
my
conclusion
a
pregnant
passage
the
greatest
in
the
world
are
conforming
to
the
innocent
humours
and
infirmities
sometimes
of
others
readiness
to
do
courtesies
for
all
speaking
well
of
all
behind
their
backs
and
sly
which
is
not
only
to
be
used
in
common
and
unconcerning
speech
but
upon
all
occasions
a
man
may
deny
a
request
chide
reprehend
command
with
good
words
nor
is
there
anything
so
harsh
which
may
not
be
inoffensively
represented

if
you
happen
to
take
a
walk
with
them
always
give
them
the
place
of
honour
which
is
that
pointed
out
by
usage
to
speak
generally
it
appears
that
several
nations
have
made
it
a
custom
that
the
right
should
always
be
held
as
a
mark
of
esteem
so
that
when
any
one
wishes
to
honour
another
he
will
put
him
on
his
right
himself
taking
the
left
when
three
are
walking
together
he
of
the
highest
quality
always
has
the
middle
he
who
takes
the
right
has
the
second
place
and
the
other
who
remains
on
the
left
has
the
third
but
in
france
when
walking
by
the
side
of
a
wall
that
place
being
almost
always
higher
and
cleaner
because
of
the
slope
the
custom
almost
always
is
that
it
be
yielded
to
the
man
of
the
highest
quality
and
particularly
when
two
are
walking
together
if
any
one
far
surpasses
others
either
in
age
estate
or
merit
yet
in
any
particular
instance
would
give
place
to
a
meaner
than
himself
in
his
own
house
or
elsewhere
the
one
ought
not
to
except
it
so
the
other
for
fear
of
making
him
appear
uncivil
ought
not
to
press
it
above
once
or
twice

the

to

accords

rather
to

when
his

insists

he
ought
to
obey
him
they
that
