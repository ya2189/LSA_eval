the

country
chapter
i
the
south
country
the
name
of
is
taken
from
a
poem
by
hilaire
belloc
beginning
i
am
living
in
the
midlands
they
are
sodden
and
unkind
i
light
my
lamp
in
the
evening
my
work
is
left
behind
and
the
great
hills
of
the
south
country
come
back
into
my
the
name
is
given
to
the
south
of
england
as
distinguished
from
the
midlands
and
by
the
severn
the
poet
is
thinking
particularly
of
sussex
and
of
the
south
downs
in
using
the
term
i
am
thinking
of
all
that
country
which
is
dominated
by
the
downs
or
by
the
english
channel
or
by
both
cornwall
and
east
anglia
have
been
admitted
only
for
the
sake
of
contrast
roughly
speaking
it
is
the
country
south
of
the
thames
and
severn
and
east
of
exmoor
and
it
includes
therefore
the
counties
of
kent
sussex
surrey
hampshire
berkshire
wiltshire
dorset
and
part
of
somerset
east
and
west
across
it
go
ranges
of
chalk
hills
their
sides
smoothly
hollowed
by
nature
and
the
or
sharply
scored
by
old
roads
on
their
lower
slopes
they
carry
the
chief
woods
of
the
south
country
their
coombes
are
often
fully
fledged
with
trees
and
sometimes
their
high
places
are
crowned
with
beech
or
fir
but
they
are
most
admirably
themselves
when
they
are
bare
of
all
but
grass
and
a
few
bushes
of
gorse
and
juniper
and
some
yew
and
their
ridges
make
flowing
but
infinitely
variable
clear
lines
against
the
sky
sometimes
they
support
a
plateau
of
flint
and
clay
which
slopes
gradually
to
the
level
of
the
streams
sometimes
they
fall
away
to
the
vales
in
ledges
first
a
long
curving
slope
then
a
plain
of
cornland
and
below
that
a
steep
but
lesser
slope
covered
with
wood
and
then
again
grassland
or
sandy
heaths
and
rivers
except
on
the
plateau
the
summits
have
few
houses
and
very
small
hamlets
the
first
terrace
has
larger
villages
and
even
a
town
or
two
but
most
of
the
towns
are
beneath
on
the
banks
of
the
rivers
and
chiefly
where
they
are
broadest
near
the
sea
or
on
the
coast
itself
the
rivers
flow
mainly
north
and
south
and
can
have
but
a
short
course
before
they
enter
the
sea
on
the
south
or
the
thames
on
the
north
those
i
remember
best
are
the
stours
the
two
rothers
but
especially
the
one
which
joins
the
arun
the
medway
the
len
the
eden
the
holling
the
teise
the
ouse
the
itchen
the
meon
the
wey
the
mole
the
kennet
the
ray
the
winterbournes
the
wiltshire
avon
the
wylye
the
ebble
and
many
little
waters
running
gold
over
new
forest
gravel
or
crystal
over
the
chalk
of
hampshire
and
not
least
of
all
that
unlucky
rivulet
the
wandle
once
a
nymph
that
walked
among
her
sisters
so
amiable
fair
so
pure
so
delicate
so
plump
so
full
so
fresh
her
eyes
so
wondrous
clear
and
first
unto
her
lord
at
doth
appear
that
in
the
goodly
court
of
their
great
sovereign
there
might
no
other
speech
be
had
amongst
the
streams
but
only
of
this
nymph
sweet
wandel
what
she
wore
of
her
complexion
grace
and
how
herself
she
bore
nor
can
i
omit
the
wiltshire
and
berkshire
canal
as
it
was
fifteen
years
ago
between
swindon
and
dauntsey
an
unfrequented
through
a
quiet
dairy
country
and
full
of
pike
and
tench
among
the
weeds
and
under
the
tall
water
docks
and
willow
herbs
which
even
then
threatened
to
subdue
it
as
they
now
have
done
the
chief
roads
make
south
and
west
from
london
almost
the
only
road
going
east
and
west
and
not
touching
london
is
the
old
road
known
between
winchester
and
canterbury
as
the
way
most
of
the
towns
are
small
market
towns
manufacturing
chiefly
beer
or
they
are
swollen
especially
in
the
neighbourhood
of
london
as
residential
quarters
on
lines
of
railway
or
as
health
and
pleasure
resorts
on
the
sea
but
any
man
used
to
maps
will
be
wiser
on
these
matters
in
an
hour
than
i
am
for
what
i
have
sought
is
quiet
and
as
complete
a
remoteness
as
possible
from
towns
whether
of
manufactures
of
markets
or
of
cathedrals
i
have
used
a
good
many
maps
in
my
time
largely
to
avoid
the
towns
but
i
confess
that
i
prefer
to
do
without
them
and
to
go
if
i
have
some
days
before
me
guided
by
the
hills
or
the
sun
or
a
stream
or
if
i
have
one
day
only
in
a
rough
circle
trusting
by
taking
a
series
of
turnings
to
the
left
or
a
series
to
the
right
to
take
much
beauty
by
surprise
and
to
return
at
last
to
my
on
a
dull
day
or
cloudy
night
i
have
often
no
knowledge
of
the
points
of
the
compass
i
never
go
out
to
see
anything
the
signboards
thus
often
astonish
me
i
wish
by
the
way
that
i
had
noted
down
more
of
the
names
on
the
signboards
at
the
there
is
a
wealth
of
poetry
in
them
as
in
that
which
points
by
a
ford
too
first
to
poulner
and
ringwood
second
to
gorley
and
fordingbridge
third
to
linwood
and
broomy
and
another
pointing
to
fordingbridge
to
ringwood
and
to
cuckoo
hill
and
furze
hill
and
another
in
the
parish
of
pentlow
pointing
to
foxearth
and
sudbury
to
cavendish
and
clare
and
to
belchamps
and
yeldham
castles
churches
old
houses
of
extraordinary
beauty
or
interest
have
never
worn
out
any
of
my
shoe
leather
except
by
accident
i
like
to
come
upon
them
usually
without
knowing
their
names
and
legends
but
do
not
lament
when
chance
takes
me
a
hundred
times
out
of
their
way
nor
have
i
ever
been
to
marlow
to
think
about
shelley
or
to
winterslow
for
sake
and
i
enter
buriton
many
times
without
remembering
gibbon
they
would
move
me
no
more
than
the
statue
of
a
man
and
a
fat
horse
with
beribboned
tail
which
a
grateful
countryside
erected
to
william
iii
in
the
market
square
at
petersfield
i
prefer
any
country
church
or
chapel
to
winchester
or
chichester
or
canterbury
cathedral
just
as
i
prefer
round
my
hat
or
is
icumen
in
to
beethoven
not
that
i
dislike
the
cathedrals
or
that
i
do
not
find
many
pleasures
amongst
them
but
they
are
incomprehensible
and
not
restful
i
feel
when
i
am
within
them
that
i
know
why
a
dog
bays
at
the
moon
they
are
much
more
difficult
or
rather
i
am
more
conscious
in
them
of
my
lack
of
comprehension
than
the
hills
or
the
sea
and
i
do
not
like
the
showmen
the
smell
and
look
of
the
museum
the
feeling
that
it
is
admiration
or
nothing
and
all
the
and
flyblown
people
round
about
i
sometimes
think
that
religious
architecture
is
a
dead
language
majestic
but
dead
that
it
never
was
a
popular
language
have
some
of
these
buildings
lived
too
long
been
too
well
preserved
so
as
to
oppress
our
little
days
with
too
permanent
an
expression
of
the
passing
things
the
truth
is
that
though
the
past
allures
me
and
to
discover
a
cathedral
for
myself
would
be
an
immense
pleasure
i
have
no
historic
sense
and
no
curiosity
i
mention
these
trivial
things
because
they
may
be
important
to
those
who
read
what
i
am
paid
for
writing
i
have
read
a
great
deal
of
history
in
fact
a
university
gave
me
a
degree
out
of
respect
for
my
apparent
knowledge
of
history
but
i
have
forgotten
it
all
or
it
has
got
into
my
blood
and
is
present
in
me
in
a
form
which
defies
evocation
or
analysis
but
as
far
as
i
can
tell
i
am
pure
of
history
consequently
i
prefer
the
old
brick
houses
round
the
cathedral
and
that
avenue
of
archaic
bossy
limes
to
the
cathedral
itself
with
all
its
turbulent
quiet
and
vague
antiquity
the
old
school
also
close
at
hand
i
was
there
after
the
end
of
the
term
once
and
two
boys
were
kicking
a
football
in
a
court
it
was
a
bright
cold
windy
april
afternoon
and
the
ancient
brick
was
penetrated
with
their
voices
and
the
sound
of
the
ball
and
i
thought
there
could
be
nothing
lovelier
than
that
court
the
pleasant
walls
and
the
broad
playing
fields
in
sight
of
a
smooth
noble
hill
and
a
temple
of
dark
firs
on
top
i
was
not
thinking
of
winchester
or
of
any
one
older
than
the
fondest
son
of
that
more
than
mother
and
little
of
him
but
was
merely
caught
up
by
and
with
the
harmony
of
man
and
his
work
of
two
children
playing
and
of
the
green
downs
and
windy
sky
and
so
i
travel
armed
only
with
myself
an
avaricious
and
often
libertine
and
fickle
eye
and
ear
in
pursuit
not
of
knowledge
not
of
wisdom
but
of
one
whom
to
pursue
is
never
to
capture
politics
the
drama
science
racing
reforms
and
preservations
divorces
book
clubs
nearly
everything
which
the
average
oh
mysterious
average
man
always
to
be
met
but
never
met
and
the
superior
and
the
intelligent
man
is
thinking
of
i
can
not
grasp
my
mind
refuses
to
deal
with
them
and
when
they
are
discussed
i
am
given
to
making
answers
like
kilve
there
is
no
i
expect
there
are
others
as
unfortunate
superfluous
men
such
as
the
sanitation
improved
housing
police
charities
medicine
of
our
wonderful
civilization
saves
from
the
fate
of
the
they
will
perhaps
follow
my
meanders
and
understand
the
critics
also
will
help
they
will
misunderstand
it
is
their
trade
how
well
they
know
what
i
ought
or
at
least
ought
not
to
do
i
must
they
have
said
avoid
manner
of
the
worst
must
not
be
though
the
recipe
is
not
to
be
had
must
beware
of
of
the
colour
in
slow
course
of
years
we
acquire
a
way
of
expression
hopelessly
inadequate
as
we
plainly
see
when
looking
at
the
methods
of
great
poets
of
beautiful
women
of
athletes
of
politicians
but
still
gradually
as
fitted
to
the
mind
as
an
old
to
the
hand
that
has
worn
and
been
worn
by
it
full
of
our
weakness
as
of
our
strength
of
our
blindness
as
of
our
vision
the
man
himself
the
poor
man
it
may
be
and
i
live
by
writing
since
it
is
impossible
to
live
by
not
writing
in
an
age
not
of
gold
but
of
brass
unlearned
incurious
but
finding
deepest
ease
and
joy
out
of
doors
i
have
gone
about
the
south
country
these
twenty
years
and
more
on
foot
especially
in
kent
between
maidstone
and
ashford
and
round
penshurst
in
surrey
between
london
guildford
and
horley
in
hampshire
round
petersfield
in
wiltshire
between
wootton
bassett
swindon
and
savernake
the
people
are
almost
foreign
to
me
the
more
so
because
country
people
have
not
yet
been
thrown
into
quite
the
same
confusion
as
townspeople
and
therefore
look
awkwardly
upon
those
who
are
not
in
trade
writing
is
an
unskilled
labour
and
not
a
trade
not
on
the
land
and
not
idle
but
i
have
known
something
of
two
or
three
men
and
women
and
have
met
a
few
dozen
more
yet
is
this
country
though
i
am
mainly
welsh
a
kind
of
home
as
i
think
it
is
more
than
any
other
to
those
modern
people
who
belong
nowhere
here
they
prefer
to
retire
here
they
take
their
holidays
in
multitudes
for
it
is
a
good
mild
and
homely
the
lands
of
wild
coast
of
mountains
of
myriad
chimneys
offer
no
such
welcome
they
have
their
race
their
speech
and
ways
and
are
jealous
you
must
be
a
man
of
the
sea
or
of
the
hills
to
dwell
there
at
ease
but
the
south
is
tender
and
will
harbour
any
one
her
quiet
people
resent
intrusion
quietly
so
that
many
do
not
notice
the
resentment
these
are
the
counties
a
man
can
hide
away
in
them
the
people
are
not
hospitable
but
the
land
is
yet
there
are
days
and
places
which
send
us
in
search
of
another
kind
of
felicity
than
that
which
dwells
under
the
downs
when
for
example
the
dark
wild
of
ashdown
or
of
woolmer
some
parcel
of
heathery
land
with
tufted
pines
and
pale
wandering
roads
rises
all
dark
and
stormy
out
of
the
gentle
vale
or
on
such
an
evening
as
when
the
sky
is
solemn
blue
save
at
the
horizon
where
it
is
faint
gold
and
between
the
blue
and
the
gold
across
the
lies
an
ashen
waste
of
level
cloud
this
sky
and
its
new
moon
and
evening
star
below
is
barred
by
the
boles
of
beeches
through
them
the
undulations
of
deserted
ploughland
are
all
but
white
with
dewy
grass
and
weed
underfoot
winds
a
disused
path
amid
almost
overlapping
mercury
the
earth
is
like
an
exhausted
cinder
cold
silent
dead
compared
with
the
great
act
in
the
sky
suddenly
a
barks
with
melancholy
and
malice
in
the
repeated
hoarse
yells
a
sound
that
awakens
the
wildest
past
out
of
the
wood
and
the
old
path
he
passes
by
me
at
a
trot
pausing
a
little
to
bark
he
vanishes
but
not
his
voice
into
the
wood
and
he
returns
still
barking
and
passes
me
again
filling
the
wood
and
the
coombe
below
with
a
sound
that
has
nothing
to
match
it
except
that
ashen
waste
in
the
cold
blue
and
golden
sky
against
which
the
fox
is
carved
in
moving
ebony
or
again
when
a
rude
dark
headland
rises
out
of
the
mist
of
the
plain
into
the
evening
sky
the
woods
seem
but
just
freed
from
the
horror
of
primeval
sea
if
that
is
not
primeval
sea
washing
their
bases
capella
hangs
low
pale
large
moist
and
trembling
almost
engulfed
between
two
horns
of
the
wood
upon
the
headland
the
frailest
beacon
of
hope
still
fluttering
from
the
storm
out
of
which
the
land
is
emerging
then
or
at
home
looking
at
a
map
of
britain
the
west
calls
out
of
wiltshire
and
out
of
cornwall
and
devon
beyond
out
of
monmouth
and
glamorgan
and
gower
and
caermarthen
with
a
voice
of
dead
townsends
eastaways
thomases
phillipses

marendaz
sea
men
and
mountain
men
westward
for
men
of
this
island
lies
the
sea
westward
are
the
great
hills
in
a
mere
map
the
west
of
britain
is
fascinating
the
great
features
of
that
map
which
make
it
something
more
than
a
picture
to
be
imperfectly
copied
by
laborious
childish
pens
are
the
great
promontories
of
caernarvon
of
pembroke
of
gower
and
of
cornwall
jutting
out
into
the
western
sea
like
the
features
of
a
grim
large
face
such
a
face
as
is
carved
on
a
prow
these
protruding
features
even
on
a
map
thrill
the
mind
with
a
sense
of
purpose
and
spirit
they
yearn
they
peer
out
ever
to
the
sea
as
if
using
eyes
and
nostrils
to
savour
the
utmost
scent
of
it
as
if
themselves
calling
back
to
the
call
of
the
waves
to
the
eyes
of
a
child
they
stand
for
adventure
they
are
lean
and
worn
and
scarred
with
the
strife
and
watching
then
gradually
into
the
mind
of
the
child
comes
the
story
that
justifies
and
still
more
inspires
and
seems
to
explain
those
promontories
for
out
towards
them
continually
have
the
conquered
races
of
the
world
retreated
and
their
settlements
give
those
corners
a
strangeness
and
a
charm
to
our
fantastic
sympathies
out
from
them
conquerors
in
their
turn
have
gone
to
found
a
legend
like
the
welsh
madoc
an
empire
like
the
men
of
devon
the
blood
of
conquered
and
conqueror
is
in
our
veins
and
it
flushes
the
cheek
at
the
sight
or
thought
of
the
west
each
man
of
us
is
as
ancient
and
complicated
as
and
as
as
cathedrals
and
castles
old
and
in
those
lands
our
crypts
and
dark
foundations
are
dimly
remembered
we
look
out
towards
them
from
the
high
camps
at
battlesbury
and
barbury
the
lines
of
the
downs
go
trooping
along
to
them
at
night
even
in
the
bosom
of
the
south
country
when
the
tranquil
bells
are
calling
over
the
corn
at
twilight
the
hills
where
the
sun
has
fallen
draw
the
heart
away
and
fill
us
with
a
desire
to
go
on
and
on
for
ever
that
same
way
when
in
the
clear
windy
dawn
thin
clouds
like
joy
are
upon
the
high
air
it
seems
that
up
there
also
in
those
placid
spaces
they
travel
and
know
the
joy
of
the
road
and
the
sun
feeding
on
the
blue
as
a
child
said
yesterday
as
lucretius
said
before
goes
the
desired
way
london
also
calls
making
the
needle
whirl
in
the
compass
for
in
london
also
a
man
may
live
as
up
great
river
wide
as
any
and
over
some
of
the
fairest
of
the
south
country
hangs
the
glimmer
of
the
city
warning
threatening
beckoning
anon
some
of
this
country
has
already
perished
or
is
so
ramparted
about
that
there
is
no
stranger
country
in
the
world
unless
it
be
those
perpendicular
valleys
cloven
among
the
blue
mountains
their
floors
level
and
of
the
purest
grass
but
accessible
only
at
the
end
nearest
the
plain
where
the
cleft
is
sometimes
so
narrow
that
not
even
a
dog
can
enter
this
then
is
my
south
country
it
covers
the
north
downs
and
the
south
downs
the
icknield
way
and
the
way
and
the
between
them
and
the
thames
and
the
sea
a
land
of
hops
fruit
corn
high
pasture
meadow
woodland
heath
and
shore
but
there
is
no
man
of
whose
powers
i
stand
more
in
awe
than
the
topographical
writer
from
bradley
or
lucas
downwards
i
shall
not
attempt
to
compete
with
them
i
should
only
be
showing
my
ignorance
and
carelessness
were
i
to
label
every
piece
of
country
which
i
chance
to
mention
or
describe
any
one
can
point
out
my
omissions
my
blindness
my
exaggeration
nor
can
i
bring
myself
to
mention
the
names
of
the
places
where
i
walked
or
sat
down
in
a
sense
this
country
is
all
out
of
the
and
has
not
a
name
this
is
not
the
south
country
which
measures
about
two
hundred
miles
from
east
to
west
and
fifty
from
north
to
south
in
some
ways
it
is
incomparably
larger
than
any
country
that
was
ever
mapped
since
upon
nothing
less
than
the
infinite
can
the
spirit
disport
itself
in
other
ways
it
is
far
smaller
as
when
a
mountain
with
tracts
of
sky
and
cloud
and
the
full
moon
glass
themselves
in
a
pond
a
little
pond
it
would
need
a
more
intellectual
eye
than
mine
to
distinguish
county
from
county
by
its
physical
character
its
architecture
its
people
its
unique
combination
of
common
elements
and
i
shall
not
attempt
it
as
often
as
not
i
have
no
doubt
mingled
parts
of
kent
with
my
wiltshire
and
so
on
and
positively
i
can
not
say
to
which
belongs
one
picture
that
occurs
to
me
as
characteristic
of
the
south
country
a
crossing
of
roads
encloses
a
waste
place
of
no
land
of
dwarf
oaks
hawthorn
bramble
and
fern
and
the
flowers
of
knapweed
and
harebell
and
golden
tormentil
embroidering
the
heather
and
the
minute
seedling
oaks
follow
one
of
these
roads
past
straight
avenues
of
elms
leading
up
to
a
farm
built
square
of
stone
under
a
roof
of
thatch
or
stone
slate
and
lying
well
back
from
the
road
across
a
level
meadow
with
some
willows
in
the
midst
elms
round
about
willow
herb
waving
rosy
by
the
stream
at
the
border
or
merely
to
a
cluster
of
ricks
and
presently
the
hedges
open
wide
apart
and
the
level
white
road
cools
itself
under
the
many
trees
of
a
green
wych
elms
sycamores
limes
and
by
a
pool
and
on
the
other
side
the
sign
of
the
hart
its
horns
held
back
upon
its
haunches
a
farm
and
its
barns
and
sheds
lie
close
to
the
green
on
either
side
and
another
of
more
stateliness
where
the
hedges
once
more
run
close
together
alongside
the
road
this
farmhouse
has
three
dormers
two
rows
of
five
shadowy
windows
below
and
an
ivied
porch
not
quite
in
the
centre
a
modest
lawn
divided
by
a
straight
path
dense
borders
of
grey
lavender
rosemary
ladslove
halberds
of
crimson
hollyhock
infinite
blending
stars
of
michaelmas
daisy
old
apple
trees
seeming
to
be
pulled
down
almost
to
the
grass
by
fruit
and
behind
the
bended
line
of
hills
a
league
away
wedding
the
lowly
meadows
the
house
and
the
trees
to
the
large
heavens
and
their
white
procession
of
clouds
out
of
the
south
and
the
sea
the
utmost
kindliness
of
earth
is
expressed
in
these
three
houses
the
trees
on
the
flat
green
the
slightly
curving
road
across
it
the
uneven
posts
and
rails
leaning
this
way
and
that
at
the
edge
of
the
pond
the
trees
are
so
arranged
about
the
road
that
they
weave
a
harmony
of
welcome
of
blessing
a
viaticum
for
whosoever
passes
by
and
only
for
a
moment
tastes
their
shade
acknowledges
unconsciously
their
attitudes
hears
their
dry
summer
murmuring
sees
the
house
behind
them
the
wayfarer
knows
nothing
of
those
who
built
them
and
those
who
live
therein
of
those
who
planted
the
trees
just
so
and
not
otherwise
of
the
causes
that
shaped
the
green
any
more
than
of
those
who
reaped
and
threshed
the
barley
and
picked
and
dried
and
packed
the
hops
that
made
the
ale
at
the
he
only
knows
that
centuries
of
peace
and
hard
work
and
planning
for
the
undreaded
future
have
made
it
possible
the
spirit
of
the
place
all
this
council
of
time
and
nature
and
men
enriches
the
air
with
a
bloom
deeper
than
blue
of
distance
it
drowses
while
it
delights
the
responding
mind
with
a
magic
such
as
once
upon
a
time
men
thought
to
express
by
gods
of
the
hearth
by
faunus
and
the
flying
nymphs
by
fairies
angels
saints
a
magic
which
none
of
these
things
is
too
strange
and
to
represent
for
after
the
longest
inventory
of
what
is
here
visible
and
open
to
analysis
much
remains
over
imponderable
but
mighty
often
when
the
lark
is
high
he
seems
to
be
singing
in
some
keyless
chamber
of
the
brain
so
here
the
house
is
built
in
shadowy
replica
if
only
we
could
make
a
graven
image
of
this
spirit
instead
of
a
muddy
untruthful
reflection
of
words
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
a
statue
the
statue
of
a
human
or
heroic
or
divine
figure
might
more
fitly
than
in
many
another
stand
in
such
a
place
a
figure
it
should
be
like
that
benign
proud
demeter
in
marble
now
banished
to
a
recess
in
a
cold
gallery
before
which
a
man
of
any
religion
or
class
or
race
or
time
might
bow
and
lay
down
something
of
his
burden
and
take
away
what
makes
him
other
than
he
was
she
would
be
at
home
and
blithe
again
enshrined
in
the
rain
or
in
this
flowery
sunlight
of
an
english
green
near
the
wych
elm
and
sycamore
and
the
walls
of
stone
the
mortar
mixed
as
in
all
true
buildings
with
human
blood
chapter
ii
the
end
of
winter
suffolk
hampshire
suffolk
there
are
three
sounds
in
the
wood
this
morning
the
sound
of
the
waves
that
has
not
died
away
since
the
sea
carried
off
church
and
cottage
and
cliff
and
the
other
half
of
what
was
once
an
inland
wood
the
sound
of
trees
a
multitudinous
frenzied
sound
of
rustling
dead
still
on
the
bough
of
others
tripping
along
the
path
like
mice
or
winding
up
in
sudden
spirals
and
falling
again
of
dead
boughs
grating
and
grinding
of
pliant
young
branches
lashing
of
finest
twigs
and
fir
needles
sighing
of
leaf
and
branch
and
trunk
booming
like
one
and
through
these
sounds
the
song
of
a
thrush
rain
falls
and
for
a
moment
only
the
dyked
marshland
below
and
beyond
the
wood
is
pale
and
luminous
with
its
flooded
pools
the
sails
of
windmills
climb
and
plunge
the
pale
sea
is
barred
with
swathes
of
foam
and
on
the
whistling
sands
the
tall
white
waves
vaunt
lean
forward
topple
and
lie
quivering
but
the
rain
increases
the
sound
and
the
mist
of
it
make
a
wall
about
the
world
except
the
world
in
the
brain
and
except
the
song
which
so
bright
and
clear
has
a
kind
of
humanity
in
it
by
contrast
with
the
huge
bulk
of
the
noises
of
sea
and
wood
rain
and
wind
cease
together
and
here
on
the
short
grass
at
the
edge
is
a
strange
birth
a
gently
convex
fungus
about
two
inches
broad
the
central
boss
of
it
faintly
indented
the
surface
not
perfectly
regular
but
dimpled
so
as
to
break
the
light
and
the
edge
wavering
away
from
the
pure
circular
form
in
hue
a
pale
chestnut
paling
to
a
transparent
edge
of
honey
colour
and
the
whole
surface
so
smooth
and
polished
by
rain
as
to
seem
coated
in
ice
what
a
thought
for
the
great
earth
on
such
a
day
out
of
the
wood
on
to
this
grass
the
thrushes
steal
running
with
heads
down
and
stopping
with
heads
prouder
than
out
also
into
the
short
corn
and
so
glad
are
they
that
they
quarrel
and
sing
on
the
ground
without
troubling
to
find
a
perch
it
is
perfectly
still
the
sun
splutters
out
of
the
thick
grey
and
white
sky
the
white
sails
shine
on
a
sea
of
steel
and
it
is
warm
and
now
in
the
luxury
of
the
first
humid
warmth
and
quiet
of
the
year
the
blackbird
sings
the
rain
sets
in
at
nightfall
but
the
wind
does
not
blow
and
still
the
blackbird
sings
and
the
thrushes
will
hardly
leave
the
corn
that
one
song
alone
sweetens
the
wide
vague
country
of
evening
the
cloudy
oak
woods
the
brown
mixen
under
the
elms
and
the
little
white
farm
behind
the
unpruned
limes
with
its
oblong
windows
irregularly
placed
and
of
unequal
size
its
white
door
almost
at
a
corner
and
the
lawn
coming
right
to
the
walls
day
breaks
and
sun
and
wind
dance
together
in
the
clouds
and
trees
but
without
rain
larks
sing
over
the
dark
heavy
cornland
in
which
the
watery
furrows
shine
the
dead
drab
grasses
wave
at
the
feet
of
the
hedgerows
little
pools
at
meadow
corners
bring
down
the
sky
to
the
dark
earth
horses
nod
before
the
plough
a
slight
haze
exhales
from
the
innumerable
rich
spongy
clods
between
the
hedges
of
oak
and
ash
now
and
then
shapeless
rags
of
white
or
clouds
wander
up
from
the
west
and
for
a
little
while
obscure
the
white
mountains
of
cloud
the
blue
sky
the
silver
sun
or
the
sweet
smoke
from
the
fires
of
hedgers
and
ditchers
rises
up
against
the
edge
of
a
copse
the
white
linen
flaps
and
glows
in
cottage
gardens
the
dung
cars
go
by
crunching
the
flints
into
the
mud
and
the
boots
and
bells
of
pony
traps
make
a
music
forgotten
since
last
february
it
is
only
the
day
of
february
yet
these
delights
of
the
soul
through
the
eyes
and
ears
are
of
spring
the
children
have
begun
to
look
for
violets
and
the
youngest
being
the
nearest
to
them
in
stature
and
in
nature
has
found
one
there
she
stands
four
years
old
with
straight
brown
legs
her
face
clear
and
soft
but
brown
as
a
new
hazel
nut
her
hair
almost
of
the
same
colour
and
paler
where
the
sun
has
bleached
it
round
her
temples
and
falling
over
her
cheeks
and
neck
and
through
it
shine
eyes
of
a
deeper
brown
the
hue
of
the
most
exquisite
flints
the
eyes
shine
the
teeth
shine
through
the
ever
parted
long
red
lips
the
chin
shines
the
brow
shines
most
of
all
with
a
lustre
that
seems
to
come
from
the
joyous
brain
behind
she
is
beautiful
and
straight
as
the
july
corn
as
the
ash
tree
standing
alone
by
the
stream
she
is
fearless
as
fire
bold
and
restless
as
wind
simple
bright
and
gay
as
a
mountain
water
in
all
her
actions
a
daughter
of
the
sun
the
wind
and
the
earth
she
has
loving
looks
for
all
from
her
fair
broad
naked
foot
to
her
gleaming
hair
she
is
to
many
the
dearest
thing
that
lives
beside
her
plays
a
dog
with
lifted
ears
head
on
one
side
rosy
tongue
bright
against
his
yellow
fur
waiting
upon
her
fancies
his
rest
and
his
motion
like
hers
are
careless
and
beautiful
gifts
of
the
sun
the
wind
and
the
earth
as
i
look
at
them
i
think
of
such
a
child
and
such
a
playmate
that
lived
two
thousand
years
ago
in
the
sun
and
once
as
they
played
each
set
a
foot
upon
the
soft
clay
of
a
tile
that
the
tile
maker
had
not
yet
burned
hard
and
red
the
tile
fell
in
the
ruin
of
a
roman
city
in
britain
was
buried
hundreds
of
years
in
ashes
and
flowering
mould
and
yesterday
i
saw
the
footprints
in
the
dark
red
tile
two
thousand
years
old
a
day
follows
of
rain
and
wind
and
it
is
the
robin
that
is
most
heard
among
the
dripping
thorns
the
robin
and
his
autumnal
voice
but
the
sky
clears
for
sunset
and
the
hour
and
as
twilight
ends
only
the
rear
of
the
disappearing
procession
of
day
cloud
is
visible
on
the
western
horizon
while
the
procession
of
night
has
but
sent
up
two
or
three
dark
forerunners
the
sky
is
of
palest
blue
and
jupiter
and
sirius
are
bright
over
the
sea
venus
over
the
land
and
mercury
just
over
the
far
oaks
the
sea
is
very
dark
except
at
the
horizon
which
is
pale
with
the
dissolving
remnant
of
sunset
gold
in
it
but
two
ranks
of
breakers
throw
up
a
waving
vapour
of
fairy
foam
against
the
dark
waves
behind
again
there
are
roaring
wet
mornings
and
sunlit
mornings
but
in
them
all
the
pewits
wheel
over
the
marsh
and
their
wild
cries
mingle
with
the
sweet
whimper
of
dunlins
the
songs
of
larks
the
glitter
of
the
dykes
the
wall
of
rain
all
day
the
sky
over
heathery
moorland
is
like
a
reduplication
of
the
moorland
except
that
at
the
horizon
the
sky
clears
at
intervals
and
fleets
of
pure
white
cloud
sail
over
the
dark
ploughland
and
green
pines
and
the
gentle
sea
is
white
only
where
the
waves
break
on
the
sand
like
a
line
of
children
in
white
frocks
advancing
with
wavers
in
the
game
of
we
come
gathering
nuts
and
or
the
west
is
angry
thick
and
grey
the
snow
is
horizontal
and
fierce
and
yet
the
south
has
a
bay
of
blue
sky
and
in
it
a
vast
sunlit
precipice
of
white
cloud
and
the
missel
thrushes
roll
out
their
songs
again
and
again
at
the
edges
of
many
woods
or
a
sun
appears
that
brings
out
the
songs
of
thrush
and
chaffinch
and
lark
and
leaves
a
chequer
of
snow
on
pine
and
ploughland
and
on
the
mole
hills
of
the
meadows
again
the
sun
disappears
and
the
swift
heavy
hail
rebounds
on
the
grass
with
a
dancing
as
of
and
there
is
no
other
sound
except
a
sudden
song
to
break
in
upon
the
beating
of
the
pellets
on
hard
ivy
and
holly
and
tender
grass
in
the
frosty
evening
the
first
moth
comes
to
the
lamp
now
the
rain
falls
rejoicing
in
its
power
and
then
the
sky
is
sunny
and
the
white
clouds
are
in
the
blue
the
wet
roads
are
azure
with
reflected
sky
the
trees
are
all
of
crystal
and
the
songs
of
thrushes
can
be
heard
even
through
the
snorting
and
rumbling
of
a
train
hampshire
the
beeches
on
the
hills
roar
and
strain
as
if
they
would
fly
off
with
the
hill
and
anon
they
are
as
meek
as
a
great
horse
leaning
his
head
over
a
gate
if
there
is
a
misty
day
there
is
one
willow
in
a
coombe
lifting
up
a
thousand
silver
catkins
like
a
thousand
lamps
when
there
is
no
light
elsewhere
another
day
a
wide
and
windy
day
is
the
and
he
goes
straight
and
swift
and
high
like
a
joyous
rider
crying
aloud
on
an
endless
savannah
and
underneath
the
rippled
pond
is
as
bright
as
a
peacock
and
millions
of
beech
leaves
drive
across
the
open
glades
of
the
woods
rushing
to
their
acheron
the
bush
harrow
stripes
the
moist
and
shining
grass
the
plough
changes
the
pale
stubble
into
a
ridgy
chocolate
they
are
peeling
the
young
ash
sticks
for
hop
poles
and
dipping
them
in
tar
at
the
dying
of
that
windy
day
the
wind
is
still
there
is
a
bright
pale
tangled
in
the
pink
whirl
of
cloud
a
sound
of
blackbirds
from
pollard
oaks
against
the
silver
sky
a
sound
of
bells
from
hamlets
hidden
among
beeches
towards
the
end
of
march
there
are
six
nights
of
frost
giving
birth
to
still
mornings
of
weak
sunlight
of
an
opaque
yet
not
definitely
misty
air
the
sky
is
of
a
milky
uncertain
pale
blue
without
one
cloud
eastward
the
hooded
sun
is
warming
the
slope
fields
and
melting
the
sparkling
frost
in
many
trees
the
woodpeckers
laugh
so
often
that
their
cry
is
a
song
a
grassy
ancient
orchard
has
taken
possession
of
the
visible
sunbeams
and
the
green
and
gold
of
the
mistletoe
glows
on
the
silvered
and
mossy
branches
of
apple
trees
the
pale
stubble
is
yellow
and
tenderly
lit
and
gives
the
low
hills
a
hollow
light
appearance
as
if
they
might
presently
dissolve
in
a
hundred
tiers
on
the
steep
hill
the
uncounted
perpendicular
straight
stems
of
beech
and
yet
not
all
quite
perpendicular
or
quite
straight
are
in
the
midst
of
a
haze
here
brown
there
rosy
of
branches
and
swelling
buds
though
but
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
in
this
faintly
clouded
air
they
are
very
small
aërial
in
substance
infinitely
remote
from
the
road
on
which
i
stand
and
more
like
reflections
in
calm
water
than
real
things
at
the
lower
margin
of
the
wood
the
overhanging
branches
form
blue
caves
and
out
of
these
emerge
the
songs
of
many
hidden
birds
i
know
that
there
are
bland
melodious
blackbirds
of
easy
musing
voices
robins
whose
earnest
song
though
full
of
passion
is
but
a
fragment
that
has
burst
through
a
more
passionate
silence
hedgesparrows
of
liquid
confiding
monotone
brisk
acid
wrens
chaffinches
and
yellowhammers
saying
always
the
same
thing
a
dear
but
courtly
praise
of
the
coming
season
larks
building
spires
above
spires
into
the
sky
thrushes
of
infinite
variety
that
talk
and
talk
of
a
thousand
things
never
thinking
always
talking
of
the
moment
exclaiming
scolding
cheering
flattering
coaxing
challenging
with
bold
voices
that
must
have
been
the
same
in
the
morning
of
the
world
when
the
forest
trees
lay
or
leaned
or
hung
where
they
fell
yet
i
can
distinguish
neither
blackbird
nor
robin
nor
hedgesparrow
nor
any
one
voice
all
are
blent
into
one
seething
stream
of
song
it
is
one
song
not
many
it
is
one
spirit
that
sings
mixed
with
them
is
the
myriad
stir
of
unborn
things
of
leaf
and
blade
and
flower
many
silences
at
heart
and
root
of
tree
voices
of
hope
and
growth
of
love
that
will
be
satisfied
though
it
leap
upon
the
swords
of
life
yet
not
during
all
the
day
does
the
earth
truly
awaken
even
in
town
and
city
the
dream
prevails
and
only
dimly
lighted
their
chalky
towers
and
spires
rise
out
of
the
sweet
mist
and
sing
together
beside
the
waters
the
earth
lies
blinking
turning
over
languidly
and
talking
like
a
child
that
now
and
then
lies
still
and
sleeps
though
with
eyes
wide
open
the
air
is
still
full
of
the
dreams
of
a
night
which
this
mild
sun
can
not
dispel
the
dreams
are
prophetic
as
well
as
reminiscent
and
are
visiting
the
woods
and
that
is
why
they
will
not
cast
aside
the
veil
who
would
rise
if
he
could
continue
to
dream
it
is
not
spring
yet
spring
is
being
dreamed
and
the
dream
is
more
wonderful
and
more
blessed
than
ever
was
spring
what
the
hour
of
waking
will
bring
forth
is
not
known
catch
at
the
dreams
as
they
hover
in
the
warm
thick
air
up
against
the
grey
tiers
of
beech
stems
and
the
mist
of
the
buds
and
fallen
leaves
rise
two
columns
of
blue
smoke
from
two
white
cottages
among
trees
they
rise
perfectly
straight
and
then
expand
into
a
balanced
cloud
and
thus
make
and
unmake
continually
two
trees
of
smoke
no
sound
comes
from
the
cottages
the
dreams
are
over
them
over
the
brows
of
the
children
and
the
babes
of
the
men
and
the
women
bringing
great
gifts
suggestions
shadowy
satisfactions
consolations
hopes
with
inward
voices
of
persuasion
those
dreams
hover
and
say
that
all
is
to
be
made
new
that
all
is
yet
before
us
and
the
lots
are
not
yet
drawn
out
of
the
urn
we
shall
presently
set
out
and
sail
into
the
undiscovered
seas
and
find
new
islands
of
the
free
the
beautiful
the
young
as
is
the
dimly
glimmering
changeless
brook
twittering
over
the
pebbles
so
is
life
it
is
but
just
leaving
the
fount
all
things
are
possible
in
the
windings
between
fount
and
sea
never
again
shall
we
demand
the
song
from
the
august
silence
never
will
july
nip
the
spring
and
lengthen
the
faces
and
take
away
their
piquancy
or
june
shut
a
gate
between
us
and
the
nightingale
or
may
deny
the
promise
of
april
hark
before
the
end
of
afternoon
the
owls
hoot
in
their
sleep
in
the
ivied
beeches
a
dream
has
flitted
past
them
more
silent
of
wing
than
themselves
now
it
is
between
the
wings
of
the
first
white
butterfly
and
it
plants
a
smile
in
the
face
of
the
infant
that
can
not
speak
and
again
it
is
with
the
brimstone
butterfly
and
the
child
who
is
gathering
celandine
and
cuckoo
flower
and
violet
starts
back
almost
in
fear
at
the
dream
the
grandmother
sitting
in
her
house
left
all
alone
in
silence
her
hands
clasped
upon
her
knees
forgets
the
courage
without
hope
that
has
carried
her
through
eighty
years
opens
her
eyes
unclasps
her
hands
from
the
knot
as
of
stiff
rope
distends
them
and
feels
the
air
and
the
dream
is
between
her
fingers
and
she
too
smiles
she
knows
not
why
a
girl
of
sixteen
not
pretty
has
seen
it
also
she
has
tied
up
her
black
hair
in
a
new
crimson
ribbon
she
laughs
aloud
with
a
companion
at
something
they
know
in
common
and
in
secret
and
as
she
does
so
lifts
her
neck
and
is
glad
from
the
sole
of
her
foot
to
the
crown
of
her
head
she
is
lost
in
her
laughter
and
oblivious
of
its
cause
she
walks
away
and
her
step
is
as
firm
as
that
of
a
ewe
defending
her
lamb
she
was
a
poor
and
misused
child
and
i
can
see
her
as
a
woman
of
fifty
sitting
on
a
london
bench
in
old
black
hat
black
clothes
crouching
over
a
paper
bag
of
fragments
in
the
beautiful
august
rain
after
heat
but
this
is
her
hour
that
future
is
not
among
the
dreams
in
the
air
she
is
at
one
with
the
world
and
a
deep
music
grows
between
her
and
the
stars
her
smile
is
one
of
those
magical
things
great
and
small
and
all
divine
that
have
the
power
to
wield
universal
harmonies
at
sight
or
sound
of
them
the
infinite
variety
of
appearances
in
the
world
is
made
fairer
than
before
because
it
is
shown
to
be
a
raiment
of
the
one
the
raiment
trembles
and
under
leaf
and
cloud
and
air
a
window
is
thrown
open
upon
the
unfathomable
deep
and
at
the
window
we
are
sitting
watching
the
flight
of
our
souls
away
away
to
where
they
must
be
gathered
into
the
music
that
is
being
built
often
upon
the
vast
and
silent
twilight
as
now
is
the
soul
poured
out
as
a
rivulet
into
the
sea
and
lost
not
able
even
to
stain
the
boundless
crystal
of
the
air
and
the
body
stands
empty
waiting
for
its
return
and
poor
thing
knows
not
what
it
receives
back
into
itself
when
the
night
is
dark
and
it
moves
away
for
we
stand
ever
at
the
edge
of
eternity
and
fall
in
many
times
before
we
die
yet
even
such
thoughts
live
not
long
this
day
all
shall
be
healed
says
the
dream
all
shall
be
made
new
the
day
is
a
fairy
birth
a
foundling
not
fathered
nor
mothered
by
any
grey
yesterdays
it
has
inherited
nothing
it
makes
of
winter
and
of
the
old
springs
that
wrought
nothing
fair
a
stale
creed
a
senseless
tale
they
are
naught
i
do
not
wonder
any
longer
if
the
song
has
grown
old
with
the
ears
that
hear
it
or
if
it
be
still
unchanged
what
dreams
are
there
for
that
aged
child
who
goes
tottering
and
reeling
up
the
lane
at
he
carries
a
basket
of
watercress
on
his
back
he
has
sold
and
he
is
tipsy
grinning
through
the
bruises
of
a
tipsy
fall
and
shifting
his
cold
pipe
from
one
side
of
his
mouth
to
the
other
though
hardly
sixty
he
is
very
old
worn
and
thin
and
wrinkled
and
bent
sideways
and
forward
at
the
waist
and
the
shoulders
yet
he
is
very
young
he
is
just
what
he
was
forty
years
ago
when
the
thatcher
found
him
lying
on
his
back
in
the
sun
instead
of
combing
out
the
straw
and
sprinkling
it
with
water
for
his
use
he
laid
no
plans
as
a
youth
he
had
only
a
few
transparent
tricks
and
easy
lies
never
has
he
thought
of
the
day
after
for
a
few
years
in
his
prime
he
worked
almost
regularly
for
one
or
two
masters
leaving
them
only
now
and
then
upon
long
errands
of
his
own
and
known
only
to
himself
it
was
then
perhaps
that
he
earned
or
received
as
a
gift
along
with
a
broken
nose
his
one
name
which
is
jackalone
for
years
he
was
the
irresponsible
jester
to
a
smug
townlet
which
was
privately
amused
and
publicly
scandalized
and
rewarded
him
in
a
gaol
where
unlike
tasso
he
never
complained
since
then
he
has
lived
by
the
sale
of
a
chance
rabbit
or
two
of
watercress
of
greens
gathered
when
the
frost
is
on
them
and
nobody
looking
by
gifts
of
broken
victuals
by
driving
a
few
bullocks
to
a
fair
by
casual
shelter
in
barns
in
roofless
cottages
or
under
hedges
he
has
never
had
father
or
mother
or
brother
or
sister
or
wife
or
child
no
dead
leaf
in
autumn
wind
or
branch
in
flooded
brook
seems
more
helpless
he
can
deceive
nobody
he
is
in
prison
two
or
three
times
a
year
for
little
things
it
seems
a
charity
to
put
a
roof
over
his
head
and
clip
his
hair
he
has
no
wisdom
by
nothing
has
he
soiled
what
gifts
were
given
to
him
at
his
birth
the
dreams
will
not
pass
him
by
they
come
to
give
him
that
confidence
by
which
he
lives
in
spite
of
and
contumely
how
little
do
we
know
of
the
business
of
the
earth
not
to
speak
of
the
universe
of
time
not
to
speak
of
eternity
it
was
not
by
taking
thought
that
man
survived
the
mastodon
the
acts
and
thoughts
that
will
serve
the
race
that
will
profit
this
commonwealth
of
things
that
live
in
the
sun
the
air
the
earth
the
sea
now
and
through
all
time
are
not
known
and
never
will
be
known
the
rumour
of
much
toil
and
scheming
and
triumph
may
never
reach
the
stars
and
what
we
value
not
at
all
are
not
conscious
of
may
break
the
surface
of
eternity
with
endless
ripples
of
good
we
know
not
by
what
we
survive
there
is
much
philosophy
in
that
irish
tale
of
the
poor
blind
woman
who
recovered
her
sight
at
well
i
say
more
prayers
than
the
rest
not
a
prayer
i
was
young
in
those
days
i
suppose
she
took
a
liking
to
me
maybe
because
of
my
name
being
brigit
the
same
as
her
others
went
unrelieved
away
that
day
we
are
as
ignorant
still
hence
the
batlike
fears
about
immortality
we
wish
to
prolong
what
we
can
see
and
touch
and
talk
of
and
knowing
that
clothes
and
flesh
and
other
perishing
things
may
not
pass
over
the
borders
of
death
with
us
we
give
up
all
as
if
forsooth
the
undertaker
and
the
gravedigger
had
archangelic
functions
along
with
the
undertaker
and
the
gravedigger
ranks
the
historian
and
others
who
seem
to
bestow
immortality
each
is
like
a
child
planting
flowers
severed
from
their
stalks
and
roots
expecting
them
to
grow
i
never
heard
that
the
butterfly
loved
the
chrysalis
but
i
am
sure
that
the
caterpillar
looks
forward
to
an
endless
day
of
eating
green
leaves
and
of
continually
swelling
until
it
would
despise
a
consummation
of
the
size
of
a
railway
train
we
can
do
the
work
of
the
universe
though
we
shed
friends
and
country
and
house
and
clothes
and
flesh
and
become
invisible
to
mortal
eyes
and
microscopes
we
do
it
now
invisibly
and
it
is
not
these
things
which
are
us
at
all
that
maid
walking
so
proudly
is
about
the
business
of
eternity
book
of
saints
and
by
lady
gregory
and
yet
it
would
be
vain
to
pretend
not
to
care
about
the
visible
raiment
of
which
our
houses
our
ships
our
gardens
our
books
are
part
since
they
also
have
their
immortal
selves
and
their
everlasting
place
else
should
we
not
love
them
with
more
than
sight
and
hearing
and
touch
for
flesh
loves
flesh
and
soul
loves
soul
yet
on
this
march
day
the
supreme
felicity
is
born
of
the
two
loves
so
closely
interwoven
that
it
is
permitted
to
forget
the
boundaries
of
the
two
and
for
soul
to
love
flesh
and
flesh
to
love
soul
and
this
ancient
child
is
rid
of
his
dishonours
and
flits
through
the
land
floating
on
a
thin
reed
of
the
immortal
laughter
this
is
altogether
he
is
perchance
playing
some
large
necessary
part
in
the
pattern
woven
by
earth
that
draws
the
gods
to
lean
forward
out
of
the
heavens
to
watch
the
play
and
say
of
him
as
of
other
men
of
birds
of
flowers
also
are
of
our
in
the
warm
rain
of
the
next
day
the
chiffchaff
sings
among
the
rosy
blossoms
of
the
leafless
larches
a
small
voice
that
yet
reaches
from
the
valley
to
the
high
hill
it
is
a
double
many
times
repeated
note
that
foretells
the
in
the
evening
the
songs
are
bold
and
full
but
the
stems
of
the
beeches
are
faint
as
soft
columns
of
smoke
and
the
columns
of
smoke
from
the
cottages
are
like
them
in
the
still
air
yet
another
frost
follows
and
in
the
dim
golden
light
just
after
sunrise
the
shadows
of
all
the
beeches
lie
on
the
slopes
dark
and
more
tangible
than
the
trees
as
if
they
were
the
real
and
those
standing
upright
were
the
returned
spirits
above
the
dead
now
rain
falls
and
relents
and
falls
again
all
day
and
the
earth
is
hidden
under
it
and
as
from
a
land
submerged
the
songs
mount
through
the
veil
the
mists
waver
out
of
the
beeches
like
puffs
of
smoke
or
hang
upon
them
or
in
them
like
fleeces
caught
in
thorns
in
the
just
penetrating
sunlight
the
long
boles
of
the
beeches
shine
and
the
chaffinch
the
yellowhammer
and
the
cirl
bunting
sing
songs
of
blissful
drowsiness
the
downs
not
yet
green
rise
far
off
and
look
through
the
rain
like
old
thatched
houses
when
a
hot
sun
has
dried
the
woods
the
wind
beats
a
cloud
of
pollen
like
grey
smoke
from
the
yews
on
the
beechen
coombes
which
are
characteristic
of
hampshire
they
are
bays
running
and
narrowing
far
into
and
up
the
sides
of
the
chalk
hills
and
especially
of
those
hills
with
which
the
high
flinty
plateau
breaks
down
to
the
greensand
and
the
plain
these
steep
sides
are
clothed
with
beeches
thousands
of
beeches
interrupted
by
the
black
yews
that
resemble
caverns
among
the
paler
trees
or
in
the
spring
by
the
green
haze
of
a
few
larches
and
the
white
flames
of
the
beam
tree
buds
sometimes
a
stream
rises
at
the
head
of
the
coombe
and
before
its
crystal
is
a
yard
wide
and
ankle
deep
over
the
crumbling
chalk
it
is
full
of
trout
the
sunny
ripples
are
meshed
like
honeycomb
if
there
is
not
a
stream
there
is
a
hop
garden
or
there
is
a
grassy
floor
approached
by
neither
road
nor
path
and
crossed
only
by
huntsman
and
hounds
all
the
year
round
the
coombes
dripping
green
and
still
are
cauldrons
for
the
making
and
unmaking
of
mists
mists
that
lie
like
solid
level
snow
or
float
diaphanous
and
horizontal
of
airiest
silk
across
the
moon
or
the
morning
sun
the
coombes
breed
whole
families
long
genealogical
trees
of
echoes
which
the
child
delights
to
call
up
from
their
light
sleep
so
too
do
fox
and
owl
at
night
and
the
cow
on
a
calm
evening
and
as
to
the
horn
and
the
cry
of
hounds
the
hangers
entangle
and
repeat
them
as
if
they
would
imprison
them
for
ever
so
that
the
phantom
exceeds
the
true
this
is
the
home
of
the
orchises
and
of
the
daintiest
snails
in
spring
yellow
and
white
and
yellowish
green
flowers
are
before
all
the
rest
under
the
beeches
the
flowers
of
the
golden
green
saxifrage
and
delicate
moschatel
the
spurge
and
the
spurge
laurel
the
hellebore
the
white
violet
and
wood
sorrel
and
the
primrose
which
becomes
greenish
in
the
light
of
its
own
leaves
to
these
must
be
added
the
yellow
green
of
young
foliage
and
of
moss
fairest
of
all
the
white
flowers
is
the
frost
flower
that
grows
about
some
rotten
fallen
branch
day
after
day
in
curls
that
are
beyond
silk
or
a
hair
or
wool
when
it
is
first
exposed
to
the
sun
by
the
hand
most
conspicuous
of
the
early
green
is
that
of
the
pale
swords
of
sedge
that
bear
purple
brown
feathers
of
flower
at
the
end
of
march
the
crystal
wavering
water
the
pale
green
stems
and
ever
so
slightly
curving
blades
and
the
dark
bloom
make
the
sense
smart
with
joy
never
was
ivy
more
luxuriant
under
the
beeches
nor
moss
so
powerful
as
where
it
arrays
them
from
crown
to
pedestal
the
lichens
fine
bushy
lichens
on
the
thorns
are
as
dense
as
if
a
tide
full
of
them
had
swept
through
the
coombe
from
the
topmost
branches
hangs
the
cordage
of
ivy
and
honeysuckle
and
clematis
the
missel
thrush
rolls
out
his
clear
song
the
woodpecker
laughs
his
loud
shaking
laughter
as
he
bounds
in
his
flight
among
the
golden
green
mistletoe
in
the
old
shaggy
apple
tree
at
the
entrance
of
the
coombe
the
blackbird
sings
composing
phrases
all
the
sweeter
for
being
strangely
like
some
in
the
songs
that
countrymen
used
to
sing
earth
has
no
dearer
voice
than
his
when
it
is
among
the
chilly
rain
at
the
end
of
the
light
all
day
there
have
been
blue
skies
and
parading
white
clouds
and
no
wind
with
sudden
invasions
of
violent
wind
and
hail
or
rain
followed
by
perfected
calm
and
warmer
sun
sun
which
lures
the
earliest
butterfly
to
alight
on
the
footworn
flints
in
the
path
up
the
coombe
at
last
the
sky
seems
securely
blue
above
the
hangers
and
a
clear
small
star
or
two
pricks
through
it
but
emerging
from
the
coombe
whose
sides
shut
out
half
the
heavens
you
see
that
the
west
has
wonderfully
ordered
and
dressed
itself
with
pale
sky
and
precipitous
dark
modelled
clouds
and
vague
woods
and
above
them
the
new
moon
the
blackbirds
sing
the
dim
downs
proceed
and
the
last
drops
glitter
on
the
black
boughs
and
pallid
primroses
why
should
this
ever
change
at
the
time
it
seems
that
it
can
never
change
a
wide
harmony
of
the
brain
and
the
earth
and
the
sky
has
begun
when
suddenly
darker
clouds
are
felt
to
have
ascended
out
of
the
and
to
have
covered
the
world
the
beeches
roar
with
rain
moon
and
downs
are
lost
the
road
bubbles
and
glows
underfoot
a
distant
blackbird
still
sings
hidden
in
the
bosom
of
the
rain
like
an
enchanter
hidden
by
his
spells
it
is
april
now
and
when
it
is
still
dark
in
the
woods
and
hedges
the
birds
all
sing
together
and
the
maze
of
song
is
dominated
by
the
hoot
like
a
full
moon
of
sound
above
myriad
rippling
noises
every
day
a
new
invader
takes
possession
of
the
land
the
wryneck
is
loud
and
persistent
never
in
harmony
with
other
birds
a
complete
foreigner
and
yet
the
ear
is
glad
of
his
coming
he
is
heard
first
not
in
the
early
morning
along
a
grove
of
oaks
and
the
whole
day
is
his
then
on
every
hand
the
gentle
willow
wrens
flit
and
sing
in
the
purple
ash
blossoms
the
martins
the
swallows
have
each
a
day
one
day
too
is
the
for
he
sits
low
near
his
mate
in
a
thicket
and
chatters
not
aloud
but
low
and
tenderly
almost
like
the
sedgewarbler
adding
a
faint
plaintive
note
like
the
and
fragments
as
of
the
song
and
chirrupings
disturbed
he
flies
away
with
chatter
as
hoarse
as
ever
the
rooks
reign
several
days
they
have
a
colony
in
a
compact
small
oval
beech
wood
that
stands
in
a
hollow
amidst
dry
grey
ploughland
and
from
the
summits
of
the
trees
in
the
most
genial
hot
day
their
cawings
are
loud
and
mellow
and
warm
as
if
they
were
the
own
voice
and
all
the
while
the
dew
is
sliding
along
the
branches
dropping
into
other
drops
or
to
the
ground
as
the
birds
flutter
at
their
nests
and
from
time
to
time
one
triple
drop
catches
the
sun
and
throbs
where
it
hangs
like
hesperus
among
the
small
stars
and
every
tender
eve
is
the
he
sings
out
at
the
end
of
the
long
bare
ash
bough
beneath
him
the
gloomy
crystal
water
stirs
the
bronze
cresses
and
on
the
banks
the
white
anemones
float
above
the
dark
misty
earth
and
under
the
hazel
leaves
yet
drooping
in
their
infancy
the
dark
hollies
catch
the
last
light
and
shine
like
water
behind
all
the
downs
are
clear
and
so
near
that
i
feel
as
well
as
see
the
carving
on
their
smooth
and
already
green
flanks
the
blackbird
gathers
up
all
the
beauty
into
one
carol
the
flowers
also
have
days
to
themselves
as
the
minute
green
moschatel
when
it
is
first
found
among
the
hedgerow
roots
or
the
violets
when
white
and
pale
purple
they
are
smelt
and
then
seen
bowed
with
dew
in
the
weedy
sainfoin
field
which
the
chain
harrow
passed
over
but
a
few
days
before
another
notable
day
is
when
the
junipers
are
perfectly
coloured
by
their
or
palest
green
but
chiefly
grey
small
berries
another
a
very
great
day
belongs
to
the
willows
when
their
crowded
fragrant
catkins
are
yellow
against
the
burning
blue
and
all
murmurous
with
bees
and
the
briers
have
their
day
when
their
green
is
a
vivid
flame
in
a
gloomy
air
against
a
dark
immense
wood
and
sepia
sky
there
is
too
a
solitary
maimed
sycamore
in
one
of
the
coombes
that
has
a
glorious
hour
when
it
stands
in
separate
masses
of
leaf
motionless
and
languid
in
the
first
joy
of
commerce
with
the
blue
air
yet
glowing
one
morning
very
early
when
the
moon
has
not
set
and
all
the
fields
are
cold
and
dewy
and
the
woods
are
still
massed
and
harbouring
the
night
though
a
few
thorns
stand
out
from
their
edge
in
affrighted
virgin
green
and
dim
starry
thickets
sigh
a
moment
and
are
still
suddenly
the
silence
of
the
chalky
lane
is
riven
and
changed
into
a
song
first
it
is
a
fierce
impetuous
downfall
of
one
clear
note
repeated
rapidly
and
ending
wilfully
in
then
it
is
a
expectant
silence
passing
into
a
long
ascendant
wail
and
almost
without
intervals
another
and
another
which
has
hardly
ceased
when
it
is
dashed
out
of
the
memory
by
the
downpour
of
those
rapidly
repeated
notes
their
abrupt
end
and
the
succeeding
silence
the
swift
notes
are
each
as
rounded
and
as
full
of
liquid
sweetness
as
a
grape
and
they
are
clustered
like
the
grape
but
they
are
wild
and
pure
as
mountain
water
in
the
dawn
they
are
also
like
steel
for
coldness
and
penetration
and
their
onset
is
like
nothing
else
it
is
the
the
long
wail
is
like
a
shooting
star
even
as
that
grows
out
of
the
darkness
and
draws
a
silver
line
and
is
no
more
so
this
glides
out
of
the
silence
and
curves
and
is
no
more
and
yet
it
does
not
die
nor
does
that
liquid
onset
they
and
their
ghosts
people
each
hanging
leaf
in
the
hazel
thicket
so
that
the
silence
is
closely
stored
other
notes
are
shut
in
the
pink
anemone
in
the
white
stitchwort
under
and
about
the
hazels
and
in
the
drops
of
dew
that
begin
to
glitter
in
the
dawn
beautiful
as
the
notes
are
for
their
quality
and
order
it
is
their
inhumanity
that
gives
them
their
utmost
fascination
the
mysterious
sense
which
they
bear
to
us
that
earth
is
something
more
than
a
human
estate
that
there
are
things
not
human
yet
of
great
honour
and
power
in
the
world
the
very
first
rush
and
the
following
wail
empty
the
brain
of
what
is
merely
human
and
leave
only
what
is
related
to
the
height
and
depth
of
the
whole
world
here
for
this
hour
we
are
remote
from
the
parochialism
of
humanity
the
bird
has
admitted
a
larger
air
we
breathe
deeply
of
it
and
are
made
free
citizens
of
eternity
we
hear
voices
that
were
not
dreamed
of
before
the
voices
of
those
spirits
that
live
in
minute
forms
of
life
the
spirits
that
weave
the
frost
flower
on
the
fallen
branch
the
gnomes
of
underground
those
who
care
for
the
fungus
on
the
beech
root
the
lichen
on
the
trunk
the
algæ
on
the
gravestone
this
hazel
lane
is
a
palace
of
strange
pomp
in
an
empire
of
which
we
suddenly
find
ourselves
guests
not
wholly
alien
nor
ill
at
ease
though
the
language
is
new
drink
but
a
little
draught
of
this
air
and
no
need
is
there
to
fear
the
ways
of
men
their
mockery
their
cruelty
their
foreignness
the
song
rules
the
cloudy
dawn
the
waiting
ranges
of
hills
and
their
woods
full
of
shadows
yet
crested
with
gold
their
lawns
of
light
the
soft
distended
grey
clouds
all
over
the
sky
through
which
the
white
sun
looks
on
the
world
and
is
glad
but
it
has
ceased
when
the
perpendicular
shafts
of
rain
divide
the
mists
over
the
hillside
woods
and
the
pewits
tangle
their
flight
through
the
air
that
is
now
alive
with
the
moist
gleaming
of
myriads
of
leaves
on
bramble
thorn
and
elder
presently
the
rain
is
only
a
glittering
of
needles
in
the
sun
for
the
sky
is
all
one
pale
grey
cloud
darker
at
the
lowest
edge
where
it
trails
upon
the
downs
and
veils
their
summits
except
in
the
there
the
edge
is
lifted
up
over
a
narrow
pane
of
silver
across
which
fleet
the
long
slender
fringes
of
the
clouds
through
this
pane
the
sun
sends
a
broad
cascade
of
light
and
up
into
this
the
fields
and
the
down
beyond
rise
and
are
transfigured
the
fields
into
a
lake
of
emerald
the
down
here
crowned
by
trees
in
a
cluster
into
a
castle
of
pearl
set
upon
the
borders
of
the
earth
slowly
this
pane
is
broadened
the
clouds
are
plumped
into
shape
are
illumined
are
distinguished
from
one
another
by
blue
vales
of
sky
until
at
length
the
land
is
all
one
gleam
of
river
and
pool
and
grass
and
leaf
and
polished
bough
whether
swollen
into
hills
or
folded
into
valleys
or
smoothed
into
plain
the
sky
seems
to
belong
to
this
land
the
sky
of
purest
blue
and
clouds
that
are
moulded
like
the
downs
themselves
but
of
snow
and
sun
in
the
clear
air
each
flower
stands
out
with
separate
and
perfect
beauty
moist
soft
and
bright
a
beauty
than
which
i
know
nothing
more
nearly
capable
of
transferring
the
soul
to
the
days
and
the
pleasures
of
infancy
the
crust
of
half
a
lifetime
falls
away
and
we
can
feel
what
blake
expressed
when
he
wrote
those
lines
in
thou
perceivest
the
flowers
put
forth
their
precious
odours
and
none
can
tell
how
from
so
small
a
centre
comes
such
sweet
forgetting
that
within
that
centre
eternity
expands
its
doors
that
og
and
anax
fiercely
guard
first
ere
the
morning
breaks
joy
opens
in
the
flowery
bosoms
joy
even
to
tears
which
the
sun

the

downy
and

waving

light
springing

the

they

the
honeysuckle
sleeping
in

the

along
upon

the

those

such
a
morning
when
the
soul
steps
back
many
years
or
is
it
many
centuries
might
have
moved
maeterlinck
to
his
descriptions
of
certain
great
moments
in
the
lives
of
plants
the
terms
of
these
descriptions
are
so
chosen
as
to
imply
an
intelligence
and
discriminating
vital
energy
in
plants
they
prove
and
explain
nothing
but
they
take
one
step
towards
the
truth
by
disturbing
the
conventional
scientific
view
and
substituting
that
of
a
man
who
passionately
looking
at
many
forms
of
life
finds
them
to
be
of
one
family
after
this
it
should
be
more
and
more
difficult
for
men
to
think
of
flowers
as
if
they
were
fragile
toys
from
an
exceptionally
brilliant
manufacturer
and
now
there
is
a
day
of
sun
and
high
blue
sky
alternating
with
low
sky
and
driving
snow
that
chequers
the
northern
sides
of
the
furrows
and
the
beech
boles
the
sun
melts
the
snow
and
all
is
clear
bright
and
cold
and
the
sky
blue
again
with
white
and
lofty
clouds
many
thrushes
are
singing
the
broad
vale
is
all
one
blue
moorland
that
has
buried
its
houses
and
the
downs
at
the
far
side
are
close
at
hand
towards
evening
the
wind
falls
and
it
is
a
glimpse
of
another
world
that
is
given
as
the
sun
is
warm
for
a
moment
on
a
low
curving
slope
of
wet
grass
with
tall
rookery
beeches
glowing
on
one
hand
and
on
the
other
bulging
white
clouds
just
emerging
from
behind
the
green
edge
into
the
blue
while
very
far
away
the
downs
both
grass
and
wood
are
deep
blue
under
a
broad
pane
of
yellowish
light
the
north
wind
makes
walking
weather
and
the
earth
is
stretched
out
below
us
and
before
us
to
be
conquered
just
a
little
perhaps
of
the
joy
at
seeing
an
fair
land
from
the
is
mingled
with
the
joy
in
the
unfolding
landscape
the
ploughlands
brighten
over
twenty
miles
of
country
pale
and
dry
among
dark
woods
and
wooded
hills
for
the
wind
has
crumbled
the
soil
almost
white
so
that
a
sudden
local
sunlight
will
make
one
field
seem
actually
of
snow
the
old
road
following
a
terrace
of
the
hillside
curves
under
yews
away
from
the
flinty
arable
and
the
grey
dry
desolation
round
about
the
iron
house
to
the
side
of
a
rich
valley
of
oak
and
ash
and
deepening
pastures
traversed
by
water
in
a
glitter
the
green
fire
of
the
larch
woods
is
yellow
at
the
crest
there
and
in
oak
and
ash
the
missel
thrush
is
an
embodiment
of
the
north
wind
summing
it
up
in
the
boldness
of
his
form
and
singing
as
a
coat
of
arms
sums
up
a
history
mounted
on
the
plume
of
the
top
of
the
tall
fir
and
waving
with
it
he
sings
of
adventure
and
puts
a
spirit
into
those
who
pass
under
and
adds
a
mile
to
their
pace
the
gorse
is
in
flower
in
the
hedges
the
has
already
set
its
ladders
against
the
thorns
ladders
that
will
soon
have
risen
to
the
top
of
every
hedge
like
scaling
ladders
of
an
infinite
army
down
from
tall
yew
and
ash
hang
the
abandoned
ropes
of
last
joy
that
have
leapt
that
height
who
has
caught
them
in
the
leap
but
the
new
are
on
their
way
and
even
the
old
show
what
can
be
done
as
they
sway
from
the
topmost
branches
at
sunset
an
immense
and
bountiful
land
lies
at
our
feet
and
the
sun
is
pouring
out
large
cups
of
conquest
the
undulating
ploughland
is
warm
in
the
red
light
and
it
is
broken
up
by
some
squares
of
old
brown
stubble
and
of
misty
young
wheat
and
lesser
green
squares
full
of
bleating
and
tinkling
sheep
out
of
these

of

white
clouds
of
a
spacious
and
luminous
sky
in
the

woods
upon
the

are
dissolving
into
a
deep

smoke
without
form
except
at
their
upper
edges
and
in
the
north
and
the
high
lands
of
berkshire
and
wiltshire
are
prostrate
and
violet
through
thirty
miles
of
witching
air
that
also
is
a
call
to
go
on
and
on
and
over

and
through
winchester

the

is
drowsed
with
the
colours

the

are
without

gathered

sings
but
can
not

the
sound
of

unchallenged
note
the

the

at

almost
rain
and
it
begins
to
pour
down
from
its
hives
among
the
branches
in
short
showers
or
in
heavy
hovering
lumps
the
leaves
of
ivy
and
holly
are
gradually
exposed
in

their
gloomy
polish
and
out
bursts
the
purple
of

the

of

the

in

to
be

agate
out
from
their
tops
blow
rags
of
mist
and
not
far
above
them
clouds
like
old
webs
go
rapidly
by
the
snow
falls
again
and
the
voices
of
the
little
summer
birds
are
buried
in
the
silence
of
the
flakes
that
whirl
this
way
and
that
aimlessly
rising
and
falling
and
crossing
or
darting
horizontally
making
the
trees
sway
wearily
and
their
light
tops
toss
and
their
numbers
roar
continually
in
the
legions
of
the
wind
that
whine
and
moan
and
shriek
their
hearts
out
in
the
solitary
house
roofs
and
doors
and
round
about
the
silence
of
snow
with
this
roar
one
wren
pierces
it
with
a
needle
of
song
and
is
gone
the

are
drowning
in

next
day
the
wind
has
flown
and
the
snow
is
again
almost
rain
there
is
ever
a
hint
of
pale
sky
above
but
it
is
not
as
luminous
as
the
earth
the
trees
over
the
road
have
a
beauty
of
darkness
and
moistness
beyond
them
the
earth
is
a
sainted
corpse
with
a
blue
light
over
it
that
is
fast
annihilating
all
matter
and
turning
the
landscape
to
a
spirit
only
night
and
the
snow
descend
upon
it
and
at
dawn
the
nests
are
full
of
snow
the
yews
and
junipers
on
a
league
of
downs
are
chequered
white
upon
white
slopes
and
the
green
larches
support
cirrus
clouds
of
snow
in
the
garden
the
daffodils
bend
under
snow
that
can
not
quite
conceal
the
yellow
flowers
but
the
snow
has
ceased
the
sky
is
at
first
pale
without
a
cloud
and
tender
as
from
a
long
imprisonment
it
deepens
in
hue
as
the
sun
climbs
and
gathers
force
the
crooked
paths
up
the
downs
begin
to
glitter
like
streaks
of
lightning
the
thrushes
sing
from
the
straight
dark
beeches
the
snow
can
not
fall
fast
enough
in
great
drops
in
showers
in
masses
that
release
the
boughs
with
a
quiver
and
a
gleam
the
green
leaves
close
to
the
ground
creep
out
and
against
them
the
snow
is
blue
a
little
sighing
wind
rustles
ivy
and
juniper
and
yew
the
sun
mounts
and
from
his
highest
battlement
of
cloud
blows
a
long
blast
of
light
over
the
pure
land
once
more
the
larch
is
wholly
green
the
beech
rosy
brown
with
buds
a
cart
goes
by
all
with
a
load
of
swedes
and
mangolds
that
seem
to
be
burning
through
the
net
of
snow
above
them
down
each
side
of
every
white
road
runs
a
stream
that
sings
and
glitters
in
ripples
like
innumerable
crystal
flowers
water
drips
and
trickles
and
leaps
and
gushes
and
oozes
everywhere
and
extracts
the
fragrance
of
earth
and
green
and
flowers
under
the
heat
that
hastens
to
undo
the
work
of
the
snow
the
air
is
hot
and
wet
the
snow
is
impatient
to
be
water
again
it
still
makes
a
cape
over
the
briers
and
brambles
and
there
is
a
constant
drip
and
steam
and
song
of
drops
from
the
crossing
branches
in
the
cave
below
loud
sounds
the
voice
of
leaf
and
branch
and
imprisoned
water
in
the
languor
and
joy
of
their
escape
on
every
hand
there
is
a
drip
and
gush
and
ooze
of
water
a
crackle
and
rustle
and
moan
of
plants
and
trees
unfolding
and
unbending
and
greeting
air
and
light
a
close
humid
host
wet
gloom
and
a
multitudinous
glitter
a
movement
of
water
and
of
the
shadows
like
puffs
of
smoke
that
fleet
over
the
white
fields
under
the
clouds
and
over
and
through
it
a
cuckoo
is
crying
and
crying
first
overhead
then
afar
and
gradually
near
and
retreating
again
he
is
soon
gone
but
the
ears
are
long
afterwards
able
to
extract
the
spirit
of
the
song
the
exact
interval
of
it
from
among
all
the
lasting
sounds
until
we
hear
it
as
clearly
as
before
out
of
the
blue
sky
out
of
the
white
cloud
out
of
the
shining
grey
water
it
is
a
word
of
power
cuckoo
the
melting
of
the
snow
is
faster
than
ever
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
there
is
none
left
except
in
some
hollows
of
the
downs
on
the
slopes
behind
the
topmost
of
the
beeches
that
darkly
fringe
the
violet
sky
in
the
misty
shutting
of
the
light
there
are
a
thousand
songs
laced
by
cries
and
the
first
hooting
of
owls
and
the
beeches
have
become
merely
straight
lines
of
pearl
in
a
mist
of
their
own
boughs
below
them
in
the
high
woods
goes
on
the
fall
of
the
melting
snow
through
the
gloomy
air
and
the
splash
on
the
dead
leaves
this
gloom
and
monotonous
sound
make
an
exquisite
cloister
visited
but
not
disturbed
by
the
sound
of
the
blackbirds
singing
in
the
mist
of
the
vale
underneath
slowly
the
mist
has
deepened
from
the
woods
to
the
vale
and
now
the
eye
can
not
see
from
tree
to
tree
then
the
straight
heavy
rain
descends
upon
the
songs
and
the
clatterings
of
blackbirds
and
when
they
are
silenced
the
watery
hoot
announces
that
the
world
belongs
to
the
beasts
and
the
rainy
dark
until
beautiful
upon
the
waters
beautiful
upon
the
mountains
is
the
song
and
most
rare
over
the
snow
but
of
all
places
and
hours
i
should
choose
the
crags
of
end
in
a
dawn
of
june
and
let
it
be
the
end
of
that
month
and
the
wind
be
grey
and
cold
so
that
the
ships
stagger
in
the
foam
and
waves
as
they
catch
the
early
light
tenderly
upon
their
sails
the
cold
beams
the
high
precipices
yet
full
of
shadow
and
of
the
giddy
calling
of
daw
and
gull
the
black
but
water
and
the
blacker
cormorant
flying
straight
across
it
just
over
the
foam
the
sky
golden
yet
still
pallid
and
trembling
from
the
dungeon
of
night
through
it
floats
that
beloved
voice
breaking
breaking
and
the
strong
year
at
the
summit
of
its
career
has
begun
to
decline
the
song
is
memorable
and
fair
also
when
the
drenched
gardens
toss
and
spread
their
petals
in
the
grass
many
a
one
hears
it
who
will
not
hear
it
again
and
many
that
once
expected
it
impatiently
hears
it
no
more
because
he
is
old
and
deaf
or
because
his
heart
is
closed
there
is
not
a
broad
and
perfect
day
of
heat
and
wind
and
sunshine
that
is
not
haunted
by
that
voice
seeming
to
say
the
earth
is
hollow
under
our
feet
and
the
sky
hollow
over
our
heads
there
are
whole
nights
when
the
cuckoo
will
not
sleep
and
the
woods
on
either
side
of
a
road
twenty
miles
long
emit
the
cry
of
these
conquerors
under
the
full
moon
and
the
white
stars
of
love
if
you
pause
it
will
appear
that
it
is
not
a
silence
that
this
song
rules
over
for
what
was
a
silence
was
full
of
sounds
as
many
sounds
as
there
are
leaves
sounds
of
creeping
gliding
pattering
rustling
slow
wormlike
continuous
noises
and
sudden
sounds
and
strangely
at
length
is
the
glorious
day
reared
high
upon
the
ruins
of
this
night
of
which
the
survivors
slink
away
into
the
old
forgotten
roads
the
dense
woods
the
chimneys
of
deserted
houses
it
is
a
jolly
note
only
when
the
bird
is
visible
close
at
hand
and
the
power
of
his
throat
is
felt
often
two
or
three
will
answer
one
another
or
for
half
a
day
will
loiter
about
a
coombe
for
the
sake
of
an
echo
it
is
one
of
the
richest
sounds
in
nature
when
two
sing
together
the
second
note
of
one
being
almost
blended
with
the
first
of
the
other
and
so
they
continue
as
if
themselves
entranced
by
the
harmony
and
the
navvy
leans
upon
his
pick
to
listen
on
the
day
after
the
great
melting
of
the
snow
the
white
beam
tree
at
the
edges
of
high
woods
and
in
the
midst
of
the
beeches
has
its
hour
when
its
thousands
of
large
white
buds
point
upward
like
a
multitudinous
candelabrum
for
me
the
white
beam
is
always
associated
with
wayfaring
its
white
buds
are
the
joy
of
spring
the
buds
like
blossoms
or
flames
bewitch
from
afar
off
they
are
always
upon
sloping
ground
and
usually
upon
hillsides
in
the
chalk
land
in
the
autumn
their
leaves
often
shrivel
before
falling
and
turn
to
a
colour
that
looks
like
pink
almond
blossom
by
contrast
with
juniper
and
yew
when
they
have
fallen
they
are
as
much
to
be
noticed
they
lie
commonly
with
their
white
undersides
uppermost
and
though
rain
soaks
them
and
wind
scatters
them
and
they
are
trodden
down
they
preserve
their
whiteness
until
the
winter
or
the
following
spring
it
is
a
tree
that
belongs
above
all
others
except
the
yew
to
the
way
and
it
is
impossible
to
forget
these
leaves
lying
white
on
the
untouched
wayside
sward
among
the
dewy
purple
and
crimson
and
gold
of
other
leaves
sparkling
in
the
sun
and
entering
into
all
the
thoughts
and
fancies
and
recollections
that
come
to
one
who
goes
in
solitude
along
that
old
road
when
the
scent
of
the
dying
year
is
pungent
as
smoke
and
sweet
as
flowers
kent
surrey
and
hampshire
the
beam
tree
is
bright
on
the
soft
hills
all
through
the
days
of
rain
following
upon
the
snow
and
sun
there
are
days
when
earth
is
absorbed
in
her
delights
of
growth
and
multiplication
the
rain
is
a
veil
which
she
wraps
about
her
that
she
may
toil
and
sing
low
at
her
myriad
divine
domesticities
untroubled
delicate
snails
climb
the
young
stalks
of
grass
and
flower
and
their
houses
pearly

the
leaves
with
their
indescribable
charm
of
infinitely
varied
division
of
wild
clematis
maple
brier
hawthorn
and
many
more
come
forth
into
the
rain
which
hangs
on
their
drooping
points
and
on
the
thorns
the
lichen
enjoys
the
enduring
mist
of
the
woods
the
blackthorns
are
crusted
and
bearded
with
lichens
of
fleshy
and
ochre
which
grow
even
on
the
thorns
themselves
and
round
the
new
leaves
and
flowers
the
birch
is
now
an
arrested
shower
of
green
but
not
enough
to
hide
the
white
limbs
of
the
nymph
in
the
midst
of
it
the
beech
trunk
is
now
most
exquisitely
coloured
it
is
stained
and
spotted
and
blotched
with
grey
and
rough
silver
and
lichen
palest
green
mould
all
the
greens
of
moss
and
an
elusive
dappling
and
graining
of
greys
of
neutral
tints
and
almost
blacks
in
the
wood
itself
still
more
diversified
by
the
trickling
rain
and
the
changing
night
the
yew
bark
is
plated
and
scaled
and
stained
with
greens
and
reds
and
greys
powdered
with
green
mould
and
polished
in
places
to
the
colour
of
mahogany
even
the
thistly
cornfields
are
dim
purple
with
flowers
and
violets
the
marsh
the
pasture
the
wood
the
hedge
has
each
its
abundance
of
bloom
and
of
scent
so
too
has
the
still
water
and
the
running
water
but
this
is
the
perfect
hour
of
the
green
of
grass
so
intense
that
it
has
an
earthly
light
of
its
own
in
the
sunless
mist
it
is
best
seen
in
meadows
bounded
on
two
or
three
sides
by
the
sheer
dark
edges
of
woods
for
in
that
contrast
the
grass
seems
a
new
element
neither
earth
nor
water
nor
sky
under
our
feet
like
the
earth
gleaming
and
even
as
water
remote
and
celestial
as
the
sky
and
the
voices
of
the
green
growing
in
the
rain
are
innumerable
the
very
ground
has
now
one
voice
of
its
own
the
gurgle
of
its
soaking
hollow
places
hampshire
the
fields
where
the
green
is
now
greenest
those
bounded
on
two
or
more
sides
by
woods
are
of
a
kind
not
peculiar
to
hampshire
they
are
usually
on
the
greensand
and
lie
in
smooth
often
winding
hollows
like
the
beds
of
rivers
sometimes
the
banks
of
these
beds
are
steep
and
they
are
clothed
in
woods
or
in
hedges
of
hornbeam
hazel
ash
and
thorn
that
have
grown
almost
to
woods
the
meadows
are
green
broad
rivers
running
up
between
the
dark
trees
that
bathe
their
roots
in
primroses
sometimes
there
is
a
stream
of
water
running
down
the
midst
of
such
a
field
but
as
the
stream
being
a
boundary
is
often
lined
with
bushes
the
particular
charm
is
lost
in
the
perfect
examples
there
is
the
smoothness
of
the
long
hollowed
meadow
the
green
the
form
the
look
of
being
a
court
or
cloister
between
the
trees
another
kind
of
field
of
great
charm
is
made
by
the
convexity
of
the
land
rising
up
from
one
side
or
both
of
such
a
hollow
meadow
these
heaving
fields
some
of
a
regular
domed
shape
are
favourites
of
the
sunset
light
in
spring
when
they
are
grassy
in
august
when
they
bear
corn
at
noon
when
there
are
cattle
grazing
on
the
steep
slope
their
shadows
are
an
exact
inversion
of
themselves
as
in
water
out
of
the
rain
and
mist
spring
has
now
risen
tender
and
lusty
fragrant
fair
to
see
so
that
it
is
beyond
a
power
to
make
even
an
inventory
of
her
lovely
ways
she
is
tall
she
is
fresh
and
bold
sweet
in
her
motion
and
in
her
tranquillity
and
there
is
a
soft
down
upon
her
lip
as
there
is
a
silken
edge
to
the
young
leaves
of
the
beeches
kent
even
the
motor
road
is
pleasant
now
when
the
nightingales
sing
out
of
the
bluebell
thickets
under
oak
and
sweet
chestnut
and
hornbeam
and
hazel
presently
it
crosses
a
common
too
small
ever
to
draw
a
crowd
a
rough
expanse
of
gorse
and
thorn
pierced
by
grassy
paths
and
surrounded
by
turf
that
is
rushy
and
mounded
by
old
ant
heaps
and
here
too
there
are
nightingales
singing
alone
the
sweeter
for
the
contrast
between
their
tangled
silent
bowers
and
the
sharp
straight
white
road
the
common
is
typical
of
the
lesser
commons
of
the
south
croft
in

the

the

enters
tall

among

and
emerges
in
a

lane
at
the

of
which
are
five
cowled
oast
houses
among
cherry
blossom
and
under
black
firs
beyond
there
is
a
hollow
winding
vale
of
meadow
and
corn
its
sides
clothed
in
oak
hazel
and

revealing
primroses
between
woods
shut
it
away
from
the
road
and
from
all
houses
but
the
farm
above
one
end
a
few
cattle
graze
there
and
the
sun
comes
through
the
sloping
woods
and
makes
the
grass
golden
or
pale
then
the
north
downs
come
in
sight
above
a
church
tower
amid
stateliest
beeches
and
vast
undulations
of
meadow
they
are
suffused
in
late
sunshine
their
trees
misty
and
massed
under
a
happy
sky
those
beeches
lie
below
the
road
lining
the
edge
of
one
long
meadow
the
opposite
sun
pours
almost
horizontal
beams
down
upon
the
perfectly
new
leaves
so
as
to
give
each
one
a
glow
and
to
some
a
silver
shimmer
about
the
shadowy
boles
for
the
moment
the
trees
lose
their
anchor
in
the
solid
earth
they
are
floating
wavering
shimmering
more
aërial
and
pure
and
wild
than
birds
or
any
visible
things
than
aught
except
music
and
the
fantasies
of
the
brain
the
mind
takes
flight
and
hovers
among
the
leaves
with
whatsoever
powers
it
has
akin
to
dew
and
trembling
song
and
rippling
water
it
is
throbbed
away
not
only
above
the
ponderous
earth
but
below
the
firmament
in
the
middle
world
of
footless
fancies
and
half
thoughts
that
drift
hither
and
thither
and
know
neither
a
heaven
nor
a
home
it
is
a
loss
of
a
name
and
not
of
a
belief
that
forbids
us
to
say
that
sprites
flutter
and
tempt
there
among
the
new
leaves
of
the
beeches
in
the
late
may
light
almost
every
group
of
oast
houses
here
seen
either
amongst
autumn
fruit
or
spring
blossom
is
equal
in
its
effect
to
a
temple
though
different
far
even
when
as
they
occasionally
are
from
the
grey
towered
or
spired
churches
standing
near
the
low
round
brick
tower
of
the
oast
house
surmounted
by
a
tiled
cone
of
about
equal
height
and
that
again
crested
with
a
white
cowl
and
vane
is
a
pleasant
form
there
are
groups
of
three
which
in
their
age
mellow
hue
roundness
and
rustic
dignity
have
suggested
the
triple
mother
goddesses
of
old
religions
who
were
depicted
as
matrons
carrying
babes
or
fruit
or
flowers
to
whom
the
peasant
brought
when
sun
and
rain
had
been
kind
those
at
kemsing
for
example
stand
worthily
beside
the
perfect
spire
among
elm
and
damson
against
the
bare
cloudy
down
and
there
are
many
others
near
the
way
of
the
same
charm
that
road
in
its
winding
course
from
winchester
to
canterbury
through
hampshire
surrey
and
kent
sums
up
all
qualities
of
roads
except
those
of
the
straight
highway
it
is
a
from
farm
to
farm
or
a
footpath
only
or
a
sheaf
of
footpaths
worn
side
by
side
or
no
longer
needed
except
by
the
curious
it
is
buried
under
nettle
and
burdock
and
barricaded
by
thorns
and
joy
and
bryony
bines
it
has
been
converted
into
a
white
country
road
for
a
few
miles
of
its
length
until
an
ascent
over
the
downs
or
a
descent
into
the
valley
has
to
be
made
and
then
once
more
it
is
left
to
footsteps
upon
grass
and
foot
trefoil
or
to
rude
wheels
over
flints
sometimes
it
is
hidden
among
untended
hazels
or
among
chalk
banks
topped
with
beech
and
yew
and
the
kestrel
plucks
the
chaffinch
there
undisturbed
or
it
goes
free
and
hedgeless
like
a
long
balcony
up
the
downs
and
unespied
it
beholds
half
the
south
country
between
ash
tree
boles
church
and
inn
and
farm
and
cottage
and
fire
it
passes
like
a
wandering
wraith
of
road
some
one
of
the
little
gods
of
the
earth
has
kept
it
safe
one
of
those
little
and
less
than
omnipotent
gods
who
neglecting
all
but
their
own
realms
enjoy
the
earth
in
narrow
ways
delighting
to
make
small
things
fair
such
as
a
group
of
trees
a
single
field
a
pure
pool
of
sedge
and
bright
water
an
arm
of
sea
a
train
of

a

i
see
their
hands
in

a
of

and
moment
of

one
of
them
assuredly
harbours
in
a
rude
wet
field
i

of
that
lies
neglected
between
two
large
estates
three
acres
at
most
of
roughly
sloping
pasture
bounded
above
by
the
brambly

of
a

summer

and
has
made
a

with
his
hairs
where
he
lies
at

the
image
of
the
god
is
in
the
grey
riven
willow
that
leans
leafless
over
the
stream
like
a
peasant
sculpture
of
old
time
there
is
another
of
these
godkins
in
a
bare
chalk
hollow
where
the
dead
thistles
stick
out
through
a
yard
of
snow
and
give
strange
thoughts
of
the
sailless
beautiful
sea
that
once
rippled
over
the
downs
one
also
in
the
smell
of
hay
and
mixen
and
breath
at
the
first
farm
out
of
london
where
the
country
is
unsoiled
there
is
one
in
many
a
worthless
waste
by
the
roadside
such
as
that
between
two
roads
that
go
almost
parallel
for
a
while
a
long
steep
piece
only
a
few
feet
broad
impenetrably
overgrown
by
blackthorn
and
blackberry
but
unenclosed
and
one
in
each
of
the
wayside
with
overhanging
beech
roots
above
and
bramble
below
one
too
perhaps
many
were
abroad
one
august
night
on
a
high
hillside
when
the
hedge
crickets
sang
high
up
in
the
dogwood
and
clematis
like
small
but
deafening
sewing
machines
and
the
glowworms
shone
in
the
thyme
and
the
crying
did
not
rend
the
breathless
silence
under
the
full
moon
and
in
the
confused
moonlit
chequer
of
the
wood
where
tree
and
shadow
were
equals
i
walked
on
a
grating
of
shadows
with
lights
between
as
if
from
under
the
earth
the
hill
was
given
over
to
a
light
happiness
through
which
i
passed
an
unwilling
but
unfeared
intruder
in
places
these
gods
preside
over
some
harmony
of
the
earth
with
the
works
of
men
there
is
one
such
upon
the
way
where
i
join
it
after
passing
the
dark
boughs
and
lightsome
flowers
of
cherry
orchards
grass
full
of
dandelions
a
dark
cluster
of
pines
elms
in
groups
and
cavalcades
and
wet
willowy
meadows
that
feed
the
medway
just
at
the
approach
there
is
a
farm
with
dormers
in
the
darkly
mellowed
roof
protected
by
sycamores
and
chestnuts
and
before
it
a
barn
with
thatched
roof
and
then
but
not
at
right
angles
another
with
ochre
tiles
and
other
outbuildings
of
old
brick
and
tile
a
waggon
lodge
of
flint
and
thatch
beside
a
pond
at
the
edge
of
a
broad
unhedged
field
where
random
oaks
shadow
the
grass
behind
runs
the
way
invisible
but
easily
guessed
under
that
line
of
white
beam
and
yew
with
here
and
there
an
ash
up
which
the
stout
plaited
stems
of
ivy
are
sculptured
for
they
seem
of
the
same
material
as
the

and
both
of

the
yew

clematis
clambers
over

sweeps
the
crescent
of

with
the
crescent
goes
the
road
up
the
sides
of
the
hills
but
nearly
always
at
the
foot
of
the
steepest
slopes

the
are
carved
white
like

at

the

scrambling
up
the
hill
with
chalky
ruts
and
rabbit
workings
between
neither
sheep
nor
crops
cover
the
hill
nor
yet
is
it
common
any
one
can
possess
it
for
an
hour
it
is
given
up
to
the
rabbits
until
londoners
can
be
persuaded
to
build
houses
on
it
at
intervals
a
road
as
old
as
the
way
itself
descends
precipitously
in
a
deep
chalk
groove
overhung
by
yew
and
beech
or
hornbeam
or
oak
and
white
clouds
drifting
in
a
river
of
blue
sky
between
the
trees
and
joins
farther
south
the
main
road
which
winds
parallel
with
the
way
and
usually
south
of
it
from
winchester
through
guildford
dorking
westerham
maidstone
ashford
and
canterbury
to
dover
strait
not
only
and
deep
roads
hollow
the
hills
for
miles
there
is
a
succession
of
small
smooth
coombes
some
grown
with
white
thorn
some
grassy
above
the
road
alternating
with
corresponding
smooth
breasts
of
turf
towers
and
spires
but
chiefly
towers
lie
beneath
and
in
the
mile
or
so
between
one
and
the
next
there
are
red
farms
or
very
rarely
a
greater
house
at
the
end
of
a
long
wave
of
grass
among
trees
above
the
white
clouds
lean
upon
the
green
rampart
of
the
hills
and
look
across
to
the
orchards
the
woods
beyond
the
oaken
weald
and
its
lesser
ridges
still
farther
and
then
the
south
downs
and
a
dream
of
the
south
sea
rain
falls
and
in
upright
grey
sheaves
passes
slowly
before
the
fresh
beech
leaves
like
ghosts
in
shadowy
procession
and
once
again
the
white
clouds
roll
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
and
the
green
is
virginal
and
out
of
the
drip
and
glimmer
of
the
miles
of
blissful
country
rises
the
song
and
the
shout
the
rain
seems
not
only
to
have
brightened
what
is
to
be
seen
but
the
eye
that
sees
and
the
mind
that
knows
and
suddenly
we
are
aware
of
all
the
joy
in
the
grandeur
and
mastery
of
an
balance
in
those
immobile
clouds
revealed
on
the
farthest
horizon
shaped
like
the
mountains
which
a
child
imagines
in
the
white
candles
of
the
beam
tree
in
the
bird
sitting
in
her
nest
in
the
hawthorn
with
uplifted
beak
and
in
the
myriad
luxuriant
variety
of
shape
and
texture
and
bright
colour
in
the
divided
leaves
of
wood
sanicle

in
the
pure
outline
of
twayblade
and

newly
dressed
in

the
landscape
recalls
the
earlier
spring
the
flowers
of
white
the
pink
and
white
anemone
and
cuckoo
flower
the
primroses
and
darker
cowslips
with
their
scentless
sweetness
pure
as
an
breath
the
solitary
wild
cherry
trees
flowering
among
still
leafless
beech
the
blackbirds
of
twilight
and
the
owls
the
pewits
wheeling
after
dusk
the
jonquil
and
daffodil
and
arabis
and
bane
of
cottage
gardens
the
white
clouds
plunged
in
blue
floating
over
the
brown
woods
of
the
hills
the
delicate
thrushes
with
speckled
breasts
paler
than
their
backs
motionless
on
dewy
turf
and
all
the
joys
of
life
that
come
through
the
nostrils
from
the
dark
not
understood
world
which
is
unbolted
for
us
by
the
delicate
and
savage
fragrances
of
leaf
and
flower
and
grass
and
clod
of
the
plumage
of
birds
and
fur
of
animals
and
breath
and
hair
of
women
and
children
how
can
our
thoughts
the
movements
of
our
bodies
our
human
kindnesses
ever
fit
themselves
with
this
blithe
world
is
it
but
vain
remorse
at
what
is
lost
or
is
it
not
rather
a
token
of
what
may
yet
be
achieved
that
makes
these
images
blind
us
as
does
the
sight
of
children
dressed
for
a
play
some
some
wholly
gay
suddenly
revealed
to
us
in
brilliant
light
after
the
night
wind
and
rain
but
at
morning
twilight
i
see
the
moon
low
in
the
west
like
a
broken
and
dinted
shield
of
silver
hanging
long
forgotten
outside
the
tent
of
a
great
knight
in
a
wood
and
inside
are
the
bones
clean
and
white
about
his
rusted
sword
in
the
east
the
sun
rises
a
drover
and
a
million
sheep
going
before
him
silent
over
the
blue
downs
of
the
dawn
and
i
am
and
must
watch
for
a
while
the
fraying
changeful
edges
of
the
lesser
clouds
drift
past
and
into
the
great
white
ones
above
or
hear
rebellious
music
that
puts
for
one
brief
hour
into
our
hands
the
reins
of
the
world
that
we
may
sit
mightily
behind
the
horses
and
drive
to
the
goal
of
our
dreams
a
footpath
leads
from
the
way
past
the
divine
undulations
and
beech
glades
of
a
park
a
broad
piece
of
the
earth
that
flows
hither
and
thither
in
curves
sudden
or
slow
but
flawless
and
continuous
and
everywhere
clothed
in
a
seamless
garment
of

the

crosses
the

into
a
lesser

traverses
a

the

make
an
unbroken
roof
over
the

except
the

there
is
not
a

in
it
for
it
is
a
small
and
narrow
strip
of
but
a
few
acres
without
any
open

gloomy
much
overgrown
by
thickets
last
leaves
lie
undisturbed

of
the

mossy
pedestals
of

in

behind
the

locked
roots
no
shout
is
heard
no
lover
walks
there
the
hurries
the
undesirable
through
and
down
into
the
weald
and
so
it
is
alone
and
for
themselves
that
the
beeches
rise
up
in
carven
living
stone
and
expand
in
a
green
heaven
for
the
song
of
the

they
also
have
their
shallow

sometimes
two

a

in

to

followed
by

then
a
tortuous
ploughland
among

of
the
great

that
cover
the
more
precipitous

at

away
with

only
the

at

a

and
the

is
emptied
and
in

there
are

into

the

the

sprinkled
over

the

writ
in

deep
and
then
deserted
and
surviving
only
as

a

against

his
father
had
farmed
land
now
covered
by
streets
he
himself
was
persuaded
to
sell
all
but
his
house
and

to
raise
money
for
a
business
which
promised
his

great
wealth
he
retained
barely
enough
to
live
upon
the
business
an
honest
one
failed
and
in
a
short
time
misfortunes
compelled
him
to
open
a
shop
he
converted
the
house
that
was
once
a
farmhouse
into
a
shop
and
not
five
years
ago
it
could
still
be
seen
at
the
end
of
a
row
of
gaudy
glittering
windows
itself
a

shop
having
but
a
common

approached
through
a
strip

where
a
put
on

its

with
the
air
of
a
princess
of
old
romance
the
back
garden
half
an
orchard
was
bordered
along
a
side
street
by
a
high
wall
and
over
that
a
broad
cherry
used
to
lean
a
gnarled
branch
and
shower
its
blossoms
upon
the
asphalte
the
complained
of
the
tree
which
had
grown
without
foreknowledge
of
the
fact
that
men
would
pass
below
in
silk

and
the
branch
was
lopped
in
the

everything

looked
over

banstead
downs
when
the
cat
was
not
lying
upon
the
socks
in

she
had
very
likely
been
kept
away
by
a
litter
of
kittens
somewhere
among
the
seldom

bundles
of

ties
or
she
lay
in
the
sun
beneath

lime
and
watched
her

pursuing
the

flight
of

leaves
the
owner
made
no
concessions
except
such
as
he
was
forced
to
as
when
he
bought
the
stock
of
jewellery
because
the
traveller
praised
his
cat
or
allowed
the

tree
to
be
mutilated
because
the

borough
council
commanded
he
dressed
in

and
never
wore
a

or
took
his
pipe
out
of

mouth
except
to

seldom
did
he
leave

unless
it
was
to
go
into
the
garden
or
to
take
a
walk
down
the
emptied
busy
street
at
night
when
the
only
sound
was
the
song
from
the
shops
the
little
old
house
rippled
over
by
creeper
was
beautiful
then
the
lime
tree
and
the
creeper
trembling
in
the
gusty
moonlight
and
the
windows
and
doorway
hollow
and
dark
and
romantic
as
if
a
poet
had
made
them
to
sting
hearts
with
beauty
and
with
regret
no
one
can
ever
say
what
the
old
man
thought
as
he
slammed
the
door
after
one
of
these
walks
and
was
alone
with
himself
certainly
he
regretted
the
big
decorous
houses
that
used
to
stand
opposite
his
veiled
by
wistaria
passion
flower
and
clematis
the
limes
that
used
to
run
the
whole
length
of
his
land
but
now
all
gone
save
this
one
how
lovely
its
fallen
leaves
looked
in
the
as
yet
untrodden
streets
in
autumn
mornings
lying
flat
and
moistly
golden
under
the
fog
the
balsam
growing
through
the
railings
the
dark
yew
tree
that
looked
among
bright
lilac
and
laburnum
like
a
negro
among
the
women
in
the
the
pathway
through
the
churchyard
in
the
days
before
they
had
to
rail
it
in
to
preserve
the
decent
turf
in
vain
for
it
was
now
littered
with
newspapers
and
among
the
tombs
of
esquire
esquire
for
they
were
all
esquires
he
regretted
the
houses
and
gardens
but
less
than
their
people
the
men
and
women
of
some
ease
and
state
of
speech
whose
kindliness
was
thrice
kind
through
its
careful
dignity
so
he
thought
and
then
the
children
there
were
no
such
children
now
and
the
young
men
and
women
the
men
a
little
alarming
the
women
strong
and
lovely
and
gentle
enough
to
supply
him
with
incarnations
at
once
of
all
those
whom
he
read
of
in
the
novels
of
scott
they
had
gone
long
ago
except
those
who
survived
vaguely
in
the
novels
he
remembered
their
houses
better
for
it
was
not
until
after
some
years
that
they
were
pulled
down
their
orchards
grubbed
up
and
their
rich
mould
carried
away
in
sacks
to
the
trumpery
villas
round
about
dragged
along
the
road
and
spilt
in
a
long
black
trail
it
was
wonderful
dark
mould
and
the
thought
of
the
apples
the
plums
the
nectarines
the
roses
which
had
grown
out
of
it
made
him
furious
when
it
was
taken
to
their
gardens
by
people
who
would
be
gone
in
a
year
or
less
and
would
grow
in
it
nothing
but
nasturtiums
and
sunflowers
there
followed
a
period
when
the
old
attitudes
the
things
that
had
been
handed
down
from
the
last
revolution
having
been
broken
up
the
gardens
became
a
possession
of
nettles
and
docks
and
fewer
and
fewer
were
the
and
hollyhocks
to
survive
the
fall
of
the
houses
the
the
harsh
blocks
of
stone
the
rasping
piles
of
bricks
the
scores
of
cold
earthenware
and
iron
articles
belonging
to
the
rows
of
villas
about
to
replace
the
old
houses
looked
more
like
ruin
than
preparation
as
they
lay
stark
and
hideous
among
the
misty
grass
and
still
blue
elms
there
were
days
when
the
thrushes
still
sang
well
among
the
rioting
undisturbed
shrubberies
but
soon
men
felled
the
elms
and
drove
away
their
shadows
for
ever
and
all
that
dwelled
or
could
be
imagined
therein
no
more
would
the
trees
be
enchanted
by
the
drunken
early
songs
of
blackbirds
the
heavenly
beauty
of
earthly
things
went
away
upon
the
timber
carriages
and
was
stamped
with
mud
the
butts
of
the
trees
were
used
to
decorate
the
gardens
of
the
new
houses
two
indeed
were
spared
by
some
folly
and
a
main
bough
fell
in
the
night
and
crushed
through
a
whole
brickwork
those
elms
had
come
unconsciously
to
be
part
of
the
real
religion
of
men
in
that
neighbourhood
and
certainly
of
that
old
man
their
cool
green
voices
as
they
swayed
their
masses
motionless
against
the
evening
or
the
summer
storms
created
a
sense
of
pomp
and
awe
they
gave
mystic
invitations
that
stirred
his
blood
if
not
his
slowly
working
humble
brain
and
helped
to
build
and
to
keep
firm
that
sanctuary
of
beauty
to
which
we
must
be
able
to
retire
if
we
are
to
be
more
than
eaters
and
drinkers
and
newspaper
readers
when
they
were
gone
he
wondered
still
humbly
what
would
do
their
work
in
the
minds
of
the
newcomers
looking
at
the
features
of
the
younger
people
held
in
a
vice
of
reserve
or
pallidly
leering
and
hearing
the
snarl
of
their
voices
he
was
not
surprised
they
had
not
been
given
a
chance
how
could
they
have
the
ease
the
state
the
kindliness
of
the
old
inhabitants
they
had
no
gods
only
a
gothic
church
often
they
supported
this
or
that
new
movement
or
bought
a
brave
new
book
but
they
continued
to
sneer
timidly
or
brutally
at
everything
else
they
were
satisfied
with
a
little
safe
departure
from
the
common
way
some
mental
or
spiritual
equivalent
to
the
of
imitation
hammered
copper
they
did
not
care
very
much
for
trees
though
they
planted
them
in
every
street
where
the
boys
and
mutilated
them
one
by
one
in
the
dark
they
cut
off
the
heads
of
a
score
of
tall
poplars
lest
perchance
the
west
wind
should
one
day
do
the
same
thing
when
one
of
the
million
was
passing
below
the
new
people
were
a
mysterious
host
the
grandchildren
of
peers
thieves
agricultural
labourers
artisans
shopkeepers
professional
men
farmers
foreign
financiers
an
unrelated
multitude
they
were
an
endless
riddle
to
the
old
man
he
used
to
stare
at
their
houses
as
one
might
stare
at
a
corpse
in
the
hope
of
discovering
that
there
was
something
alive
there
they
were
as
impenetrable
as
their
houses
when
at
night
the
blinds
of
the
lighted
rooms
were
drawn
and
figures
or
parts
of
figures
shot
fantastically
by
he
read
of
their
bankruptcies
their
appointments
their
crimes
their
successes
unwittingly
in
the
newspapers
he
could
never
take
it
as
a
matter
of
course
to
pass
to
be
continually
surrounded
by
thousands
of
whom
he
knew
nothing
to
whom
he
was
nothing
well
did
they
keep
their
secrets
this
blank
or
shamefaced
crowd
of
discreetly
dressed
people
who
might
be
anywhere
he
turned
from
them
to
his
garden
and
and
thinking
of
those
who
had
walked
there
and
in
the
long
garden
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
he
felt
at
home
again
with
his
cat
and
her
long
line
of
descendants
that
long
garden
had
survived
the
big
house
to
which
it
had
belonged
a
merchant
had
lived
there
with
his
family
of
four
daughters
dark
tall
women
whose
pride
and
tender
speech
the
old
trees
in
their
garden
often
recalled
all
were
beautiful
and
they
were
most
beautiful
together
they
walked
they
rode
they
played
and
read
in
the
garden
and
the
old
man
could
see
them
there
they
were
said
to
be
clever
and
their
father
was
wealthy
they
were
nearly
always
together
and
as
often
as
possible
with
him
they
were
a
tribe
apart
of
extraordinary
perfection
of
strength
and
grace
holding
their
own
against
the
world
and
yet
as
the
old
man
thought
to
himself
looking
at
their
garden
in
the
rain
not
one
of
them
was
ever
married
they
had
moved
right
into
london
after
selling
their
house
and
land
they
had
come
to
his
shop
once
or
twice
after
and
made
an
excuse
for
going
into
the
garden
they
looked
into
their
own
as
if
they
had
lost
something
there
thinking
of
them
he
went
into
his
shop
and
opened
a
book
a
minute
black
insect
disturbed
from
among
the
leaves
crawled
over
and
over
the
white
page
as
he
pretended
to
read
it
went
in
zigzags
long
lost
in
the
black
and
white
desert
sometimes
turning
the
sharp
edge
and
going
to
the
other
side
of
the
page
but
as
a
rule
the
edge
alarmed
it
and
it
retreated
it
was
never
still
it
reminded
him
of
himself
they
were
both
lost
upon
the
vast
surface
of
the
earth
but
of
course
that
was
not
why
he
left
nobody
knew
why
he
left
in
his
seventieth
year
he
ran
away
bursting
out
of
the
crowd
as
one
sheep
no
braver
than
the
rest
will
do
sometimes
inexplicably
he
has
brought
his
cats
with
him
and
he
has
money
enough
to
last
until
he
is
dead
being
considered
by
his
niece
as
of
unsound
mind
he
is
free
to
do
as
he
will
and
is
happy
when
he
is
alone

shed
many

to
taste
something
of

early
alarm
in

the
uncultured

alarm
which
is
in

tempered

not

to

it

chapter
vi
a
return
to
nature
i
turn
into
my
next
inn
with
unusual
hopes
for
it
was
here
some
years
ago
that
i
met
for
the
first
time
a
remarkable
man
it
was
nine
on
a
late
july
evening
and
the
haymakers
only
just
set
free
came
stamping
into
the
bar
the
last
stopped
at
the
door
while
the
carter
stood
one
hand
on
the
latch
and
drank
his
pint
before
leading
his
horses
into
the
stall
after
the
haymakers
in
their
pale
corduroys
and
dirty
white
slops
came
a
tall
spare
man
not
recently
shaved
dressed
in
grey
grey
coat
grey
breeches
and
stockings
and
a
tall
hard
felt
hat
that
was
old
and
grey
he
called
for
sixpenny
ale
and
wiping
the
hay
dust
from
his
neck
sat
down
beside
me
no
he
is
not
here
perhaps
he
will
never
get
out
of
london
again
i
asked
him
the
way
to
the
nearest
village
and
whether
a
bed
was
to
be
had
there
he
answered
that
it
was
some
way
off
paused
looked
at
me
drank
from
his
tankard
and
added
in
a
lower
voice
that
he
would
be
glad
if
i
would
come
and
share
his
place
such
an
unusual
invitation
enforced
assent
a
quarter
of
a
mile
down
the
next
he
opened
a
little
oaken
gate
that
slammed
after
us
and
there
in
a
corner
of
a
small
flat
field
was
his
sleeping
place
under
an
oak
would
i
care
to
join
him
in
fried
bacon
and
broad
beans
and
tea
at
six
the
next
morning
he
lit
a
wisp
of
hay
and
soon
had
a
fire
burning
and
brought
over
some
hay
and
sacks
for
the
second
bed
the
lights
of
the
farmhouse
shone
on
the
other
side
of
the
little
field
behind
lilac
bushes
the
farmhouse
pump
gave
out
a
cry
like
a
guinea
fowl
for
a
few
minutes
then
the
lights
went
out
i
asked
the
name
of
the
farm
and
he
told
me
come
here
almost
every
summer
for
the
haymaking
he
said
and
detecting
my
surprise
that
it
was
not
his
first
year
of
haymaking
he
continued
is
my
tenth
summer
to
be
he
was
a
man
of
hardly
over
thirty
and
i
noticed
that
his
hands
though
small
and
fine
were
rough
and
warty
and
dark
thoughtlessly
i
remarked
that
he
must
find
the
winter
hard
if
he
travelled
like
this
all
the
year
round
he
said
with
a
sigh
is
and
that
is
why
i
go
back
in
the
winter
at
least
partly
back
to
i
was
still
perplexed
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
of
the
clerkly
class
but
no
accent
and
i
could
not
think
what
he
did
in
london
that
was
compatible
with
his
present
life
you
a
londoner
then
and
no
i
was
born
at
the
village
of
in
caermarthenshire
my
father
was
a
clerk
in
a
coal
office
of
the
neighbouring
town
but
he
thought
to
better
himself
worked
hard
in
the
evenings
and
came
to
london
when
i
was
seven
for
a
post
we
lived
in
wandsworth
in
a
small
street
newly
built
i
went
to
a
school
close
by
until
i
was
sixteen
and
then
i
went
into
a
silk
office
my
father
died
soon
after
he
had
never
been
strong
and
from
the
first
work
in
the
city
i
have
heard
my
mother
say
he
was
a
doomed
man
he
made
no
friends
while
i
was
young
he
gave
up
all
his
spare
time
to
me
and
was
happy
wheeling
me
my
mother
walking
alongside
out
into
the
country
on
every
sunday
that
was
not
soaking
wet
and
nearly
every
saturday
afternoon
too
was
on
one
of
these
excursions
when
they
had
left
me
to
myself
a
little
while
to
talk
more
gravely
than
they
usually
did
when
we
were
out
like
that
that
there
was
suddenly
opened
before
me
like
a
yawning
pit
yet
not
only
beneath
me
but
on
every
side
infinity
endless
time
endless
space
it
was
thrust
upon
me
i
could
not
grasp
it
i
only
closed
my
eyes
and
shuddered
and
knew
that
not
even
my
father
could
save
me
from
it
then
in
a
minute
it
was
gone
to
a
more
blessed
child
some
fair
or
imposing
vision
might
have
risen
up
out
of
the
deep
and
given
him
a
profounder
if
a
sadder
eye
for
life
and
the
world
how
unlike
it
was
to
the
trance
feeling
out
with
infinite
soul
to
earth
and
stars
and
sea
and
remote
time
and
recognizing
his
oneness
with
them
to
me
but
later
than
that
this
occasionally
recurring
experience
was
as
an
intimation
of
the
endless
pale
road
before
and
behind
which
the
soul
has
to
travel
it
was
a
terror
that
enrolled
me
as
one
of
the
helpless
superfluous
ones
of
the
earth
was
their
only
child
that
lived
and
my
joy
in
me
was
very
great
equalled
only
by
his
misery
at
the
life
which
he
had
to
lead
and
which
he
foresaw
for
me
he
used
to
read
to
me
waking
me
up
for
the
purpose
sometimes
when
he
reached
home
late
or
if
he
did
not
do
that
rousing
me
an
hour
before
breakfast
his
favourite
books
were
compleat
and
the
poems
of
wordsworth
the
diaries
of
thoreau
and
the
history
of
i
remember
crying
when
i
was
twelve
with
despair
of
human
fickleness
to
think
that
white
even
though
he
was
an
old
man
could
have
it
in
his
heart
to
write
that
farewell
to
natural
history
at
the
end
of
his
last
letter
to
barrington
my
father
read
these
books
to
me
several
times
in
a
sad
hoarse
voice
as
it
seemed
to
me
though
when
he
paused
he
was
happy
enough
which
i
had
often
great
trouble
to
endure
as
i
got
older
and
able
and
willing
to
read
for
myself
so
full
was
i
of
a
sense
of
the
real
wild
country
which
i
had
never
seen
the
black
mountains
of
caermarthen
i
hardly
recalled
that
i
became
fanciful
and
despised
the
lavish
creeper
that
hung
like
a
costly
dress
over
the
fence
between
our
garden
and
the
next
because
the
earth
it
grew
in
was
not
red
earth
but
a
black
pasty
compound
full
of
cinders
and
mortar
and
decayed
rags
and
kittens
i
used
to
like
to
go
to
the
to
smell
the
singeing
hoof
and
to
the
and
smell
the
horses
and
see
the
men
standing
about
in
loose
shirts
hanging
braces
bare
arms
clay
pipes
with
a
sort
of
free
look
that
i
could
not
see
elsewhere
the
navvies
at
work
in
the
road
or
on
the
railway
line
were
a
tremendous
pleasure
and
i
noticed
that
the
clerks
waiting
for
their
trains
in
the
morning
loved
to
watch
these
hulking
free
and
easy
men
doing
something
that
looked
as
if
it
mattered
not
like
their
own
ledger
work
and
so
on
i
had
the
same
sort
of
pleasure
looking
up
the
street
that
rose
from
east
to
west
and
seeing
the
sun
set
between
the
two
precipices
of
brick
wall
at
the
top
it
was
as
if
a
gate
opened
there
and
through
it
all
the
people
and
things
that
saddened
me
had
disappeared
and
left
me
to
myself
it
was
like
the
pit
too
that
opened
before
me
as
a
little
child
father
died
of
consumption
i
was
then
just
able
to
earn
my
own
living
so
i
was
left
in
lodgings
and
my
mother
returned
to
wales
i
worked
hard
at
figures
at
least
i
went
early
and
stayed
late
and
never
stopped
to
talk
to
the
others
yet
i
made
frequent
mistakes
and
the
figures
swam
in
a
mist
of
american
rivers
and
english
waterfalls
and
gipsy
camps
so
that
it
was
a
wonder
i
could
ever
see
my
thoreau
and
wordsworth
and
borrow
without
these
figures
fancy
men
adopting
as
a
cry
the
to
apparently
they
are
too
to
think
of
a
right
to
live
and
would
be
content
only
to
work
it
is
not
wonderful
that
with
such
a
cry
they
do
very
little
men
can
not
fight
hard
for
the
to
as
i
did
my
office
was
at
the
bottom
of
a
pit
the
four
sides
of
the
pit
were
walls
with
many
windows
and
i
could
hear
voices
speaking
in
the
rooms
behind
and
the
click
of
typewriters
but
could
not
see
into
them
only
for
two
or
three
days
in
june
could
i
see
the
sun
out
of
the
pit
but
in
the
hot
days
buzzed
on
my
panes
and
i
took
care
of
them
until
one
by
one
they
lay
dead
upon
the
window
ledge
there
were
no
spiders
and
they
seemed
to
have
a
good
life
sparrows
sometimes
flew
up
and
down
the
pit
and
once
for
a
week
i
had
the
company
of
a
pigeon
it
sat
day
after
day
in
a
hole
in
the
opposite
wall
until
it
died
and
fell
on
to
the
paved
yard
below
the
clouds
sailed
over
the
top
of
the
pit
flew
over
all
in
october
afternoons
i
liked
the
fog
when
all
the
lights
were
lit
and
though
we
did
not
know
one
another
in
the
pit
we
seemed
to
keep
one
another
company
but
i
liked
the
rain
best
of
all
it
used
to
splash
down
from
all
sides
and
make
a
country
noise
and
i
looked
up
and
saw
the
quaint
cowls
sitting
like
cats
on
the
and
had
ridiculous
fancies
that
took
me
far
away
for
a
second
or
two
worst
time
of
all
was
two
or
three
years
after
my
death
i
spent
most
of
my
poor
earnings
on
clothes
i
took
the
trouble
to
talk
and
smoke
and
think
as
much
as
possible
like
the
other
nine
young
men
in
the
railway
carriage
that
took
me
into
the
city
i
learned
their
horrible
cowardly
scorn
for
those
who
were
poor
or
outlandish
and
for
all
things
that
were
not
like
those
in
their
own
houses
or
in
those
of
the
richer
people
of
their
acquaintance
or
envy
we
were
slaves
and
we
gilded
our
the
journalist
and
hack
writer
said
i
worse
off
at
least
your
master
only
asked
for
your
dregs
the
hack
writer
is
asked
to
give
everything
that
can
be
turned
into
words
at
short
notice
and
so
the
collar
round
his
neck
is
never
taken
off
as
yours
was
between
six
in
the
afternoon
and
nine
in
the
but
it
is
open
to
you
to
do
good
or
bad
we
could
only
do
bad
all
day
we
were
doing
things
which
we
did
not
understand
which
could
not
in
any
way
concern
us
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
what
we
had
been
taught
at
school
had
read
in
books
or
had
heard
from
our
fathers
and
mothers
when
he
was
angry
the
head
of
the
firm
used
to
say
we
had
better
take
care
or
a
machine
would
supersede
us
in
ten
years
instead
of
twenty
we
had
been
driven
out
of
life
into
a
corner
in
an
underground
passage
where
everything
was
unnecessary
that
did
not
help
us
to
be
quick
at
figures
or
taking
down
letters
from
dictation
or
neat
in
dress
and
obedient
to
the
slaves
who
were
set
over
us
when
we
were
out
of
the
office
we
could
do
nothing
which
unfitted
us
for
it
the
head
of
the
firm
used
to
say
that
we
were
each
a
part
however
humble
in
the
sublime
machine
of
modern
civilization
that
not
one
of
us
was
unnecessary
and
that
we
must
no
more
complain
or
grow
restive
than
does
the
earth
because
it
is
one
of
the
least
elements
in
this
majestic
we
continued
to
be
neat
when
we
were
away
from
the
office
we
were
disobedient
to
everything
and
everybody
else
that
was
not
armed
with
the
power
of
taking
away
our
bread
to
the
old
the
poor
the
children
the
women
the
ideas
which
we
had
never
dreamed
of
and
that
came
among
us
as
a
white
blackbird
comes
in
the
winter
to
a
barbarous
parish
where
keeper
and
gardener
and
farmer
go
out
with
their
guns
and
stalk
it
from
hedge
to
hedge
until
starved
and
conspicuous
and
rather
apart
from
its
companions
it
falls
to
their
beastly
shot
and
is
sold
to
one
of
the
gentry
who
puts
it
into
a
glass
case
on
a
saturday
or
sunday
i
broke
away
in
a
vague
unrest
and
walked
alone
to
the
pretty
places
where
my
father
and
mother
had
taken
me
as
a
little
boy
most
of
them
i
had
not
seen
for
five
or
six
years
my
visits
were
often
formal
i
walked
out
and
was
glad
to
be
back
to
the
lights
of
the
street
the
strong
tea
the
newspaper
and
the
novel
but
one
day
i
went
farther
than
usual
to
a
wood
where
we
used
to
go
without
interference
and
after
finding
all
the
and
and
nests
within
reach
boil
a
kettle
and
have
tea
i
had
never
in
that
wood
seen
any
man
or
woman
except
my
father
and
mother
never
heard
a
voice
except
theirs
my
father
perhaps
reading
wordsworth
aloud
and
the
singing
and
the
in
the
pond
at
the
edge
it
used
to
shut
out
everything
but
what
i
had
learned
to
love
most
sunshine
and
wind
and
flowers
and
their
love
when
i
saw
it
again
i
cried
i
really
could
not
help
it
for
a
road
had
been
made
alongside
of
it
and
the
workmen
going
to
and
fro
had
made
a
dozen
gaps
in
the
hedge
and
trodden
the
wood
backward
and
forward
and
broken
down
the
branches
and
made
it
noisome
worse
than
all
the
field
the
golden
field
where
i
used
to
lie
among
the
buttercups
and
be
alone
with
the
blue
sky
where
i
first
felt
the
largeness
and
dearness
and
nearness
of
the
blue
sky
as
a
child
of
eight
and
put
up
my
hand
in
my
delight
to
draw
it
through
the
soft
blue
substance
that
seemed
so
near
the
field
was
enclosed
a
chapel
built
it
was
a
cemetery
for
all
the
unknown
herd
strange
to
one
another
strange
to
every
one
else
that
filled
the
new
houses
spreading
over
the
land
first
i
was
for
running
away
at
once
but
the
sight
made
me
and
my
legs
dragged
and
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
get
home
i
mean
to
my
lodgings
i
was
quite
different
after
that
i
was
ashamed
of
my
ways
and
now
spent
all
my
spare
time
and
money
in
going
out
into
the
country
as
far
as
possible
and
reading
the
old
books
and
the
new
ones
that
i
could
hear
of
in
the
same
spirit
i
lived
for
these
things
it
was
now
that
i
knew
my
slavery
everything
reminded
me
of
it
the
return
half
of
my
railway
ticket
to
the
country
said
plainly
have
got
to
be
back
at
not
later
than
then
i
used
to
go
a
different
way
back
or
even
walk
the
whole
way
to
avoid
having
this
thing
in
my
pocket
that
proclaimed
me
a
slave
was
now
that
i
first
accepted
the
invitation
of
a
relation
who
lived
on
the
east
coast
very
near
the
sea
the
sea
had
a
sandy
shore
bounded
by
a
perpendicular
sandy
cliff
to
the
edge
of
which
came
rough
moorland
the
sea
washed
the
foot
of
the
cliff
at
high
tide
and
swept
the
yellow
sand
clean
twice
a
day
wiping
away
all
footprints
and
leaving
a
fresh
arrangement
of
blue
pebbles
glistering
in
the
bitter
wind
it
was
impossible
to
be
more
alone
than
on
this
sand
and
i
was
contented
again
the
sea
brought
back
the
feelings
i
had
when
i
lay
in
the
buttercup
field
the
cemetery
and
looked
into
the
sky
walking
over
the
moor
the
undulations
of
the
land
hid
and
revealed
the
sea
in
an
always
unexpected
way
and
often
as
i
turned
suddenly
i
seemed
to
see
the
blue
sky
extended
so
as
to
reach
nearly
to
my
feet
and
up
it
went
small
brown
or
white
clouds
like
birds
like
ships
in
fact
they
were
ships
sailing
on
a
sea
that
mingled
with
the
sky
it
seemed
a
beautiful
life
where
clouds
could
not
help
being
finely
spun
or
carved
or
pebbles
help
being
delicious
to
eye
and
touch
but
out
of
the
extremity
of
my
happiness
came
my
worst
grief
i
fell
in
love
i
fell
in
love
with
one
of
my
cousins
a
girl
of
seventeen
she
never
professed
to
return
my
love
but
she
was
a
most
true
friend
and
for
a
time
i
was
intoxicated
with
the
delight
i
now
envy
even
the
brief
moment
of
pain
and
misery
that
i
had
in
those
days
was
clever
and
understanding
so
that
i
was
always
at
my
best
with
her
and
yet
too
she
was
as
sweet
as
a
child
and
strange
as
an
animal
the
few
moments
of
pain
were
when
i
saw
her
with
the
other
girls
when
they
were
together
running
on
the
sands
or
talking
or
dancing
they
seemed
all
to
be
one
like
the
wind
and
sometimes
i
thought
that
like
the
wind
they
had
no
heart
amongst
them
except
mine
that
raced
with
the
runners
and
sighed
among
the
laughers
it
was
lovely
to
see
her
with
animals
with
cows
or
horses
her
implicit
motherhood
going
out
to
them
in
an
animal
kindness
a
bluff
tenderness
without
thought
at
times
i
looked
carefully
and
solemnly
into
her
eyes
until
i
was
lost
in
a
curious
pleasure
like
that
of
walking
in
a
shadowy
still
cold
place
a
cathedral
or
wintry
grove
she
had
the
largest
of
dark
grey
eyes
and
she
did
not
turn
away
or
smile
but
looked
fearlessly
forward
careless
and
unashamed
like
a
deep
pool
in
a
wood
unused
to
wayfarers
then
she
seemed
so
much
a
child
and
i
longed
for
the
days
which
i
had
never
really
had
when
i
could
have
been
as
careless
and
bold
and
free
as
she
was
no
i
could
never
teach
those
eyes
and
lips
the
ways
of
love
that
was
for
some
boy
to
do
and
i
thought
i
will
be
content
to
love
her
and
to
have
her
friendliness
i
was
old
for
my
years
and
my
life
without
the
influence
of
women
in
office
and
lodgings
i
thought
had
made
me
unfit
for
her
delicate
ways
i
turned
away
and
the
sunny
ships
in
the
sea
were
mournful
because
of
my
thoughts
but
i
could
not
wait
i
told
her
my
love
she
was
not
angry
or
indifferent
she
did
not
reject
it
she
was
afraid
they
sent
her
away
to
college
she
overworked
and
overplayed
and
they
have
told
me
she
is
now
a
schoolmistress
i
see
her
sad
and
firm
with
folded
hands
when
i
knew
her
she
was
tall
and
straight
with
long
brown
hair
in
two
heavy
plaits
a
shining
rounded
brow
grey
eyes
and
a
smile
of
inexpressible
sweetness
in
which
i
once
or
twice
surprised
her
pleased
with
the
happiness
and
beauty
of
her
thoughts
and
of
nature
i
had
lost
her
or
thought
i
had
not
comforted
to
live
but
that
there
is
this
jewel
in
the
world
which
i
may
see
again
i
resolved
that
i
would
not
be
a
slave
any
more
for
a
few
weeks
i
used
to
fancy
it
was
only
by
a
chance
i
had
lost
her
and
every
now
and
then
as
i
mused
over
it
i
got
heated
and
my
thoughts
raced
forward
as
if
in
the
hope
of
overtaking
and
averting
that
very
evil
chance
which
had
already
befallen
and
had
in
fact
caused
the
train
of
thought
saved
every
penny
that
i
could
from
my
salary
in
six
months
i
had
saved
twenty
pounds
out
of
this
i
bought
a
new
black
suit
a
pair
of
boots
and
a
hat
and
gave
them
to
my
landlady
and
asked
her
to
take
care
of
them
until
i
returned
which
might
be
at
the
end
of
october
it
was
then
april
i
gave
notice
to
my
employers
and
left
them
the
next
day
very
early
i
left
london
and
walked
all
day
and
all
night
until
i
reached
the
sea
there
i
bathed
and
ate
a
hearty
meal
and
walking
along
the
cliffs
till
i
came
to
a
small
farmhouse
i
engaged
a
bedroom
and
there
i
slept
and
thought
and
slept
undisturbed
for
hours
i
was
free
i
was
free
to
dream
myself
no
longer
one
of
the
mob
with
care
my
money
would
last
until
even
if
i
did
no
work
was
a
warm
wet
may
and
by
the
end
of
the
month
there
was
a
plentiful
crop
of
weeds
and
i
had
no
difficulty
in
getting
work
at
hoeing
strawberry
picking
and
cherry
picking
followed
i
was
very
slow
and
earned
little
but
it
was
now
warm
enough
to
sleep
out
and
i
earned
my
food
by
the
end
of
july
as
i
liked
the
work
i
was
as
useful
with
my
hayrake
as
any
of
the
women
and
better
than
most
of
the
odd
hands
i
wore
my
fingers
raw
at
tying
up
barley
and
oats
and
later
on
at
feeding
the
threshing
machine
but
before
the
end
of
october
the
weather
drove
me
back
to
london
with
ten
shillings
in
my
pocket
put
on
my
new
clothes
and
got
as
good
a
berth
as
my
first
one
and
in
the
hope
of
another
spring
and
summer
out
of
doors
i
passed
the
winter
cheerfully
to
save
more
money
i
went
to
bed
as
soon
as
i
got
back
to
my
lodgings
and
read
myself
to
sleep
may
a
spell
of
fine
weather
drove
me
to
give
notice
again
and
i
walked
as
far
as
maidstone
the
first
day
my
second
summer
was
like
my
first
i
was
already
known
at
farms
when
they
could
not
give
me
work
at
once
they
gave
me
leave
to
fish
in
the
three
or
four
ponds
to
be
found
on
all
the
farms
in
the
weald
of
kent
and
i
had
many
a
large
if
not
always
savoury
meal
of
tench
and
eels
at
the
end
of
the
summer
i
had
three
pounds
in
my
pocket
and
little
less
by
the
end
of
october
winter
i
passed
as
before
for
five
years
i
lived
in
this
way
then
for
the
sake
of
going
abroad
on
my
savings
i
worked
for
a
whole
year
at
a
desk
and
spent
four
months
along
the
loire
and
down
to
bordeaux
from
there
i
worked
my
passage
to
newport
since
then
i
have
gone
back
to
my
old
here
he
paused
and
mused
i
asked
him
if
he
still
found
it
easy
to
get
work
in
london
it
he
replied
handwriting
is
worse
and
it
is
slow
the
first
weeks
in
london
seem
to
undo
all
the
good
of
my
summer
outing
especially
as
my
salary
is
less
than
it
used
to
be
they
begin
to
ask
me
if
i
am
a
married
man
when
i
apply
for
work
the
november
rains
remind
me
that
i
have
rheumatism
it
is
my
great
fear
that
i
may
need
a
doctor
and
so
spend
my
savings
and
be
unable
to
leave
london
until
field
work
is
plentiful
in
june
but
i
have
my
freedom
i
could
if
necessary
take
an
place
and
live
entirely
on
the
land
they
begin
to
look
at
my
hands
when
i
apply
for
clerical
work
and
i
wear
ten
years
hence
is
ten
years
too
far
ahead
for
me
to
look
though
i
am
less
cheerful
than
i
used
to
be
i
realize
that
i
belong
to
the
suburbs
still
i
belong
to
no
class
or
race
and
have
no
traditions
we
of
the
suburbs
are
a
muddy
confused
hesitating
mass
of
small
courage
though
much
endurance
as
for
myself
i
am
and
hence
suffer
unutterable
loneliness
i
know
what
bitterness
it
is
to
be
lacking
in
those
strong
tastes
and
impulses
which
blinding
men
to
what
does
not
concern
them
enables
them
to
live
with
a
high
heart
for
example
i
have
a
sensitive
palate
and
am
glad
of
my
food
yet
whenever
i
taste
lamb
which
i
do
when
i
can
my
pleasure
is
spoilt
by
the
sight
of
the
butcher
carrying
a
lamb
under
his
arm
there
it
is
i
am
sensitive
on
all
sides
your
true
man
would
either
forget
the
sight
or
he
would
be
moved
to
a
crusade
i
can
do
neither
am
weary
of
seeing
things
the
outsides
of
things
for
i
see
nothing
else
it
makes
me
wretched
to
think
what
swallows
are
to
many
children
and
poets
and
other
men
while
to
me
they
are
nothing
but
inimitable
compact
dark
weights
tumbling
i
do
not
know
how
through
the
translucent
air
nothing
more
and
yet
i
know
they
are
something
more
i
apprehend
their
weight
buoyancy
and
velocity
as
they
really
are
but
i
have
no
vision
then
it
is
that
i
remember
those
words
of
sir
thomas
am
sure
there
is
a
common
spirit
that
plays
within
us
yet
makes
no
part
in
us
and
that
it
is
the
spirit
of
god
the
fire
and
scintillation
of
that
noble
and
mighty
essence
which
is
the
life
and
radical
heat
of
spirits
this
is
that
gentle
heat
that
brooded
on
the
waters
and
in
six
days
hatched
the
world
this
is
that
irradiation
that
dispels
the
mists
of
hell
the
clouds
of
horror
fear
sorrow
despair
and
preserves
the
region
of
the
mind
in
serenity
whosoever
feels
not
the
warm
gale
and
gentle
ventilation
of
this
spirit
though
i
feel
his
pulse
i
dare
not
say
he
lives
for
truly
without
this
to
me
there
is
no
heat
under
the
tropic
nor
any
light
though
i
dwell
in
the
body
of
the
dare
not
say
i
live
and
yet
the
cows
the
quiet
cows
in
this
fine
soft
weather
stare
enviously
at
me
through
the
gate
though
they
know
nothing
of
death
and
i
know
it
must
come
and
that
even
though
often
desired
when
it
comes
it
will
be
unwelcome
yet
they
stare
enviously
at
me
i
am
sure
have
no
courage
i
can
at
least
endure
i
can
use
my
freedom
to
become
a
slave
again
and
at
least
i
know
that
i
have
lost
nothing
by
my
way
of
living
yes
i
can
endure
and
if
after
my
death
i
am
asked
questions
difficult
to
answer
i
can
ask
one
that
is
unanswerable
which
i
have
many
times
asked
myself
often
in
london
but
not
here
here
i
love
my
food
and
my
work
my
rest
my
dreams
are
good
i
am
not
unkindly
spoken
to
i
make
no
enemies
yet
i
can
not
look
forward
there
is
nothing
ahead
just
as
i
can
not
look
back
my
people
have
not
built
they
were
not
settled
on
the
earth
they
did
nothing
they
were
oil
or
grit
in
a
great
machine
they
took
their
food
and
shelter
modestly
and
not
ungratefully
from
powers
above
that
were
neither
kind
nor
cruel
i
hope
i
do
no
less
i
wish
i
could
do
more
again
returns
that
old
feeling
of
my
childhood
i
felt
it
when
i
had
left
my
cousin
i
have
felt
it
suddenly
not
only
in
london
but
on
the
top
of
the
downs
and
by
the
sea
the
immense
loneliness
of
the
world
as
if
the
next
moment
i
might
be
outside
of
all
visible
things
you
know
how
it
is
on
a
still
summer
evening
so
warm
that
the
ploughman
and
his
wife
have
not
sent
their
children
to
bed
and
they
are
playing
and
their
loud
voices
startle
the
thought
of
the
woods
my
feeling
is
like
that
space
and
quiet
and
my
own
littleness
stupendously
exaggerated
i
have
wished
i
could
lay
down
my
thoughts
and
desires
and
noises
and
stirrings
and
cease
to
trouble
that
great
peace
it
was
perhaps
of
this
loneliness
that
the
psalmist
spoke
days
are
consumed
like
smoke
i
watch
and
am
as
a
sparrow
alone
on
the
the
world
is
wrong
but
the
night
is
fine
the
dew
light
and
the
moist
air
is
full
of
the
honeysuckle
scent
i
will
smoke
another
pipe
of
your
tobacco
and
leave
you
for
a
while
i
like
to
be
alone
before
i
the
next
i
saw
of
him
was
when
he
was
frying
bacon
and
boiling
beans
for
our
meal
my
night
thoughts
he
said
be
thankful
for
the
white
dry
road
and
the
blue
sky
we
are
not
so
young
but
that
we
must
be
glad
it
is
summer
and
fine
as
for
me
the
dry
weather
is
so
sweet
that
i
like
the
smell
of
elder
flower
and
the
haycart
dung
and
the
dust
that
get
into
the
throat
of
an
evening
he
went
away
to
wash
at
the
pump
as
the
cattle
spread
out
from
the
into
the
field
and
filled
it
with
their
sweet
breath
and
the
sound
of
their
biting
the
thick
grass
i
saw
him
again
a
few
years
later
london
was
hot
and
dry
and
would
have
been
parched
cracked
and
shrivelled
had
it
been
alive
instead
of
dead
the
masonry
was
so
dry
that
the
eye
wearied
of
it
before
the
feet
wearied
of
the
pavement
and
both
desired
the
rain
that
makes
the
city
at
one
with
nature
the
were
like
so
many
captives
along
the
streets
shackled
to
the
flagstones
pelted
with
dust
humiliated
all
their
rusticity
ravished
though
not
forgotten
the
very
sky
lofty
blue
was
parched
the
blue
and
the
white
being
soiled
by
a
hot
scum
that
harmonizes
with
gritty
pavements
and
stark
towers
and
spires
the
fairest
thing
to
be
seen
away
from
the
river
was
the
intense
young
green
of
the
trying
to
grow
up
through
the
gratings
which
surround
the
trees
of
the
streets
the
grass
was
a
prophet
muttering
wild
ambiguous
things
and
since
his
voice
was
very
small
and
came
from
underground
it
was
hard
to
hear
him
even
without
understanding
thousands
tread
down
the
grass
so
that
except
for
a
few
hours
at
night
it
can
never
emerge
from
the
grating
some
vast
machinery
plunged
and
thundered
behind
the
walls
but
though
they
trembled
and
grew
hot
it
burst
not
through
even
so
the
multitude
in
the
streets
of
men
and
horses
and
machines
and
carriages
of
all
kinds
roared
and
moved
swiftly
and
continuously
encaged
within
walls
that
are
invisible
and
they
also
never
burst
through
both
are
free
to
do
what
they
are
told
all
of
the
crowd
seem
a
little
more
securely
imprisoned
than
him
who
watches
because
he
is
aware
of
his
bars
but
they
move
on
or
seem
to
do
on
and
on
round
and
round
as
thoughtless
as
the
belt
of
an
engine
there
was
not
one
face
i
knew
not
one
smiled
not
one
relaxed
or
contracted
with
a
thought
an
emotion
a
fancy
but
all
were
clear
hard
and
fixed
in
a
vice
so
that
though
they
were
infinite
in
their
variety
no
two
eyebrows
set
the
same
way
no
two
mouths
in
the
same
relation
to
the
eyes
the
variety
seemed
the
product
of
a
senseless
ingenuity
and
immense
leisure
as
of
a
sublime
philatelist
hardly
one
spoke
only
the
women
moved
from
left
to
right
instead
of
straight
on
and
their
voices
were
inaudible
when
their
lips
moved
the
roar
in
which
all
played
a
part
developed
into
a
kind
of
silence
which
not
any
one
of
these
millions
could
break
the
sea
does
not
absorb
the
little
rivers
more
completely
than
this
silence
the
voices
of
men
and
women
than
this
solitude
their
personalities
now
and
then
a
face
changed
an
eyebrow
was
cocked
or
a
mouth
fell
but
it
meant
less
to
me
than
the
flutter
as
of
a
bird
when
drop
by
drop
the
rain
drips
from
the
beeches
and
gives
a
plash
and
a
trembling
to
one
leaf
and
then
another
in
the
undergrowth
there
is
a
more
than
human
force
in
the
movement
of
the
multitude
more
than
the
sum
of
all
the
forces
in
the
arched
necks
the
grinding
chest
muscles
and
the
firm
feet
of
the
horses
the
grace
of
the
bright
women
the
persistency
of
the
tall
men
and
thick
men
they
can
not
stop
they
look
stupid
or
callous
or
blank
or
even
cruel
they
are
going
about
business
they
conceal
their
own
hiding
it
so
that
they
forget
as
a
drunkard
forgets
where
he
has
hidden
his
gold
where
they
have
hidden
it
hiding
their
souls
under
something
stiffer
and
darker
than
the
clothing
of
their
bodies
it
is
hard
to
understand
why
they
do
not
sometimes
stop
one
another
to
demand
where
the
soul
and
the
business
is
hid
to
snatch
away
the
masks
it
was
intolerable
that
they
were
not
known
to
me
that
i
was
not
known
to
them
that
we
should
go
on
like
waves
of
the
sea
obeying
whatever
moon
it
is
that
sends
us
thundering
on
the
unscalable
shores
of
night
and
day
such
force
such
determination
as
moved
us
along
the
burning
streets
might
scale
olympus
where
was
he
who
could
lead
the
between
a
pack
of
cabs
and
a
pack
of
there
was
a
quiet
space
of
fifty
yards
in
length
for
a
little
while
it
seemed
that
the
waves
were
refusing
their
task
there
was
not
one
black
coat
not
one
horse
not
one
brightly
loaded
no
haste
it
was
a
procession
in
front
marched
a
tall
son
of
man
with
white
face
long
black
hair
more
like
plumage
than
hair
in
its
abundance
and
form
and
he
wore
no
hat
he
walked
straight
as
a
soldier
but
with
long
slow
steps
and
his
head
hung
so
that
his
bare
breast
supported
it
for
he
had
no
coat
and
his
shirt
was
half
open
he
had
bare
dark
legs
and
shoes
on
his
feet
his
hands
were
behind
his
back
as
if
he
were
handcuffed
two
men
walked
beside
him
in
other
black
clothes
and
black
hats
worn
grey
two
unnoticeable
human
beings
with
small
rough
beards
dull
eyes
shuffling
gait
two
others
followed
them
close
each
carrying
one
of
the
poles
of
a
small
white
banner
inscribed
with
the
words
these
also
were
unnoticeable
thin
grey
bent
but
young
their
clothes
their
faces
their
hair
their
hats
almost
the
same
dry
colour
as
the
road
it
was
impossible
to
say
what
their
features
were
because
their
heads
hung
down
and
their
hats
were
drawn
well
on
to
their
heads
and
their
eyes
were
unseen
they
could
not
keep
step
nor
walk
side
by
side
and
their
banner
was
always
shaky
and
always
awry
next
in
no
order
came
three
others
of
the
same
kind
shambling
like
the
rest
of
middle
height
moderately
moderately
thin
their
hands
in
their
pockets
in
one
of
these
i
recognized
the
man
who
was
born
in
caermarthenshire
a
cart
came
close
behind
drawn
by
a
fat
grey
donkey
who
needed
no
driving
for
the
one
who
rode
in
the
cart
had
his
back
to
the
shafts
and
leaning
forward
on
a
tub
into
which
money
was
expected
to
be
thrown
he
appeared
to
be
talking
to
those
who
trailed
at
the
back
for
he
waved
an
arm
and
wagged
his
yellow
beard
he
was
fat
and
dressed
in
a
silk
hat
and
striped
trousers
almost
too
ancient
to
be
ridiculous
had
they
not
kept
company
with
a
jaunty
pair
of
yellow
boots
he
was
midway
between
a
seaside
minstrel
and
a
minister
had
not
one
gesture
destroyed
the
resemblance
by
showing
that
he
wore
no
socks
round
about
his
coat
also
were
the
words
unemployed
repeated
or
crudely
varied
those
whom
he
addressed
were
the
fifteen
or
twenty
who
completed
the
procession
but
seemed
not
to
listen
they
were
all
bent
young
or
men
with
unintentional
beards
skins
and
slightly
darker
clothes
many
wore
overcoats
the
collars
turned
up
and
some
had
nothing
under
them
except
a
shirt
and
one
not
that
all
with
hands
in
pockets
one
carrying
a
pipe
all
silent
and
ashamed
struggled
onward
with
bent
knees
no
two
walked
together
there
was
no
approach
to
a
row
or
a
column
in
their
arrangement
nor
was
there
any
pleasing
irregularity
as
of
plants
grown
from
seed
by
no
means
could
they
have
been
made
to
express
more
feebleness
more
unbrotherliness
more
lack
of
principle
purpose
or
control
each
had
the
look
of
the
meanest
thief
between
his
captors
two
blue
benevolent
impersonal
policemen
large
men
occasionally
lifted
their
arms
as
if
to
help
forward
the
contemptible
procession
sometimes
with
a
quick
motion
of
the
hand
they
caused
the
straggling
rear
to
double
their
pace
for
a
few
yards
by
running
with
knees
yet
more
bent
and
flapping
and
hands
still
deep
in
pockets
only
for
a
few
yards
for
their
walking
pace
was
their
best
all
having
the
same
strength
the
same
middle
height
the
same
stride
though
no
two
could
be
seen
keeping
step
the
traffic
thickened
and
amidst
the
horses
that
nodded
and
trampled
and
the
that
fumed
and
fretted
the
procession
was
closed
up
into
a
grey
block
behind
the
on
one
side
of
the
donkey
was
the
man
his
right
arm
now
resting
on
the
neck
on
the
other
side
the
policemen
in
front
the
hung
down
their
heads
and
held
up
their
poles
often
the
only
remnant
visible
was
the
raven
crest
of
the
leader
the
multitude
on
the
pavement
continued
to
press
straight
onward
or
to
flit
in
and
out
of
coloured
shops
none
looked
at
the
standard
the
dark
man
and
his
cloudy
followers
except
a
few
of
the
smallest
newspaper
boys
who
had
a
few
spare
minutes
and
rushed
over
to
march

them
in
the
hope
of

a
speech
or

on
the
arms
of
their

faintly

little
pitiful
but
gladly
conscious
of
their
own
security
and
pleasantness
men
with
the
historic
sense
glanced
and
noted
the
fact
that
there
was
a
procession
one
man
standing
on
the
kerb
took
a
sovereign
from
his
pocket
looked
at
it
and
then
at
the
unemployed
made
a
little
gesture
of
utter
bewilderment
and
dropping
the
coin
down
into
the
drain
below
continued
to
watch
comfortable
clerks
and
others
of
the
servile
realized
that
here
were
the
unemployed

whom
the
newspapers
had
said
this
and
that
pressing
very
complicated

the

next
day
they
would
smile
again
with
pride
that
they
had
seen
the

which
ended
in

violent
speeches
against
the

vii
a
railway
carriage
surrey
sussex
i
left
london
as
quickly
as
possible
the
railway
carriage
was
nearly
full
of
men
reading
the
same
newspapers
under
three
or
four
different
names
when
a
little
grizzled
and
spectacled
man
of
middle
age
entered
a
printer
perhaps
with
a
twisted
face
and
simple
and
puzzled
expression
that
probably
earned
him
many
a
laugh
from
boys
as
he
sat
down
he
recognized
a
sailor
a
tall
ponderous
man
made
in
three
distinct
storeys
who
supported
his
enormous
red
hands
upon
knees
each
fit
to
have
been
the
mould
of
a
helmet
i
never
did
and
how
are
you
harry
they
looked
at
one
another
kindly
but
with
a
question
piercing
through
the
kindness
and
an
effort
to
divine
the
unknowable
without
betraying
curiosity
the
kindness
did
in
fact
melt
away
the
almost
physical
obstacle
of
twenty
years
spent
apart
and
in
ignorance
of
one
another
did
you
leave
the
old
place
said
the
sailor
after
you
did
yourself
harry
just
after
the
shipwreck
of
the
yes
years
it
so
long
i
could
have
sworn
you
had
that
beard
when
i
saw
you
last
and
the
sailor
looked
at
him
in
a
way
that
showed
he
had
already
bridged
the
years
and
knew
the
man
do
you
ever
go
back
to
the
old
place
charlie
nash
and
young
woolford
and
the
shepherd
me
see
how
is
maggie
looker
broke
in
the
sailor
upon
a
genial
answer
in
the
bud
you
know
she
took
ill
very
soon
after
you
went
away
and
then
they
thought
she
was
all
right
again
but
they
could
not
quite
get
rid
of
the
cough
and
it
got
bad
in
the
winter
and
all
through
the
spring
it
was
so
she
died
in
the
she
christ
but
what
times
we
and
then
in
reminiscences
fast
growing
gay
the
mere
triumph
of
memory
the
being
able
to
add
each
to
the
store
was
a
satisfaction
they
told
the
story
of
a
pretty
country
girl
whom
they
had
quarrelled
over
until
she
grew
too
proud
for
both
how
heavy
was
her
hair
how
she
could
run
and
nobody
was
like
her
for
finding
a
her
boldness
and
carelessness
filled
them
with
envy
still
reckon
we
old
ones
would
call
her
a
tomboy
now
said
the
sailor
should
say
we
i
wonder
what
sort
of
a
wife
she
would
have
made
i
know
you
remember
that
day
her
and
you
and
me
got
lost
in
the
forest
and
we
were
there
all
night
and
i
got
a
hiding
for
poor
when
we
see
our
way
any
more
we
lifted
her
up
into
that
old
beech
where
the
green
nest
and
you
took
off
your
coat
and
breeches
to
cover
her
so
did
you
though
i
reckon
one
would
have
been
enough
now
i
come
to
think
of
know
about
that
but
how
we
did
have
to
keep
on
the
move
all
night
to
keep
dared
not
go
very
far
for
fear
of
losing
the
in
the
morning
i
wondered
what
we
should
do
about
getting
back
our
wanted
me
to
go
because
my
shirt
any
holes
in
we
both
went
before
we
had
made
up
our
minds
which
should
go
first
and
call
up
she
starts
lord
how
she
did
laugh
she
says
all
my
eye
and
betty
martin
and
so
did
we
laugh
and
i
never
felt
a
bit
silly
either
she
was
a
good
sort
of
girl
she
was
man
and
woman
i
never
met
the
likes
of
her
never
heard
tell
of
the
equal
of
her
said
the
sailor
musingly
harry
nor
likely
to
be
i
think
and
yourself
i
was
i
married
maggie
it
was
after
the
first
baby
a
small
boy
in
a
corner
could
not
get
on
with
his
novelette
he
stared
and
now
and
then
unconsciously
imitating
their
faces
or
he
would
correct
this
mere
wonderment
and
become
shy
and
uncomfortable
at
the
frank
ways
of
these
men
talking
aloud
in
a
crowded
carriage
and
utterly
regardless
of
others
about
private
matters
a
trim
shop
assistant
pretended
to
read
about
the
cricket
but
listened
and
could
not
conceal
his
cold
contempt
for
men
so
sunken
as
to
give
themselves
away
like
this
a
dark
thin
genial
puritan
clerk
looked
pitifully
with
some
twinkles
of
superiority
that
asked
for
recognition
from
his
these
for
as
such
he
regarded
them
and
would
not
wholly
condemn
others
occasionally
jerked
out
a
glance
or
rolled
a
leaderless
eye
or
rustled
a
newspaper
without
losing
the
dense
veil
over
their
individuality
that
made
them
tombs
monuments
not
men
one
sat
gentle
kindly
stupidly
envying
these
two
their
spirited
free
talk
their
gestures
the
hearty
draughts
of
life
which
they
seemed
to
have
taken
all
were
botanists
who
had
heard
and
spoken
words
but
had
no
sense
of
the
beauty
and
life
of
the
flower
because
fate
had
refused
or
education
destroyed
the
gift
of
liberty
and
of
joy
surrey
then
i
saw
a
huge
silence
of
meadows
of
woods
and
beyond
these
of
hills
that
raised
two
breasts
of
empurpled
turf
into
the
sky
and
above
the
hills
one
mountain
of
cloud
that
beamed
as
it
reposed
in
the
blue
as
in
a
sea
the
white
cloud
buried
london
with
a
in
i
like
to
think
how
easily
nature
will
absorb
london
as
she
absorbed
the
mastodon
setting
her
spiders
to
spin
the
and
her
worms
to
fill
in
the
grave
and
her
grass
to
cover
it
pitifully
up
adding
flowers
as
an
unknown
hand
added
them
to
the
grave
of
nero
i
like
to
see
the
preliminaries
of
this
toil
where
nature
tries
her
hand
at
mossing
the
factory
roof
rusting
the
deserted
railway
metals
sowing
grass
over
the
deserted
platforms
and
flowers
of
on
ruinous
hearths
and
walls
it
is
a
real
satisfaction
to
see
the
long
narrowing
wedge
of
irises
that
runs
alongside
and
between
the
rails
of
the
and
chatham
railway
almost
into
the
heart
of
london
and
there
are
many
kinds
of
weather
when
the
air
is
full
of
voices
prophesying
desolation
the
outer
suburbs
have
almost
a
moorland
fascination
when
fog
lies
thick
and
over
their
huge
flat
wastes
of
grass
expectant
of
the
builder
but
does
not
quite
conceal
the
stark
outlines
of
a
traction
engine
some
procumbent
timber
a
bonfire
and
frantic
figures
darting
about
it
and
aërial
scaffolding
far
away
other
fields
yet
unravished
but
menaced
the
fog
restores
to
a
primeval
state
and
what
a
wild
noise
the
wind
makes
in
the
telegraph
wires
as
in
wintry
heather
and
gorse
when
the
waste
open
spaces
give
way
to
dense
streets
there
is
a
common
here
and
a
lawn
there
where
the
poplar
leaves
if
it
be
november
lie
taintless
on
the
grass
and
the
starlings
talk
sweet
and
shrill
and
cold
in
the
branches
and
nobody
cares
to
deviate
from
the
asphalte
path
to
the
dewy
grass
the
houses
beyond
the
green
mass
themselves
gigantic
remote
dim
and
the
pulse
of
london
beats
low
and
inaudible
as
if
she
feared
the
irresistible
enemy
that
is
drawing
its
lines
invisibly
and
silently
about
her
on
every
side
if
a
breeze
arises
it
makes
that
sound
of
the
dry
curled
leaves
chafing
along
the
pavement
at
night
they
seem
spies
in
the
unguarded
but
there
are
also
days
and
spring
and
summer
days
too
when
a
quiet
horror
thicks
and
stills
the
air
outside
london
the
ridges
of
trees
high
in
the
mist
are
very
grim
the
isolated
trees
stand
cloaked
in
conspiracies
here
and
there
about
the
fields
the
houses
even
whole
villages
are
translated
into
terms
of
unreality
as
if
they
were
carved
in
air
and
could
not
be
touched
they
are
empty
and
mournful
as
skulls
or
churches
there
is
no
life
visible
for
the
ploughmen
and
the
cattle
are
figures
of
light
dream
all
is
soft
and
grey
the
land
has
drunken
the
opiate
mist
and
is
passing
slowly
and
unreluctantly
into
perpetual
sleep
trees
and
houses
are
drowsed
beyond
awakening
or
farewell
the
mind
also
is
infected
and
gains
a
sort
of
ease
from
the
thought
that
an
eternal
and
universal
rest
is
at
hand
without
any
cry
or
any
pain
sussex
the
road
skirts
the
marshland
the
stream
and
the
town
and
goes
through
a
gap
in
the
downs
towards
another
range
and
more
elms
and
farms
at
its
feet
stately
walks
the
boy
with
his
perpendicular
whip
alongside
four
while
the
carter
rides
it
is
a
pleasant
thing
to
see
them
going
to
their
work
in
the
early
gold
of
the
morning
fresh
silent
their
horses
jingling
down
the
firm
road
if
they
were
leading
their
team
to
yoke
them
to
the
chariot
of
the
sun
they
could
not
be
more
noble
they
are
the
first
men
i
have
seen
this
morning
and
truly
they
create
for
a
little
while
the
illusion
that
they
are
going
to
guide
the
world
and
that
all
will
be
well
in
the
golden
freshness
under
the
blue
the
road
now
divides
to
go
round
the
base
of
the
downs
but
a
farm
track
sets
out
to
climb
them
there
at
the
corner
is
a
church
on
the
very
edge
of
the
flat
vale
and
its
elms
and
ashes
in
the
midst
of
meadows
a
plain
towered
church
but
with
a
rough
churchyard
half
graveyard
and
half
orchard
its
grass
and
parsley
and
nettle
uncut
under
the
knotty
apple
trees
splashed
with
silver
and
dull
dotted
by
silver
buds
among
branches
that
are
matted
densely
as
a
nest
the
dust
from
the
high
road
powders
the
nettles
and
perfects
the
arresting
melancholy
of
the
desolation
so
quiet
so
austere
and
withal
as
airy
as
a
dream
remembered
but
above
are
the
downs
green
and
sweet
with
uplifting
grass
and
beyond
them
the
sea
darkly
gleaming
under
lustrous
white
cliffs
and
abrupt
ledges
of
turf
in
the
south
in
the
a
procession
of
tufted
trees
going
uphill
in
single
file
in
the
the
dazzling
slate
roofs
of
a
distant
town
two
straight
sea
walls
and
two
steamers
and
their
white
wakes
northward
the
most
beautiful
minor
range
in
all
the
downland
isolated
by
a
river
valley
at
the
edge
of
which
it
ends
in
a
gulf
of
white
quarry
while
on
the
other
side
it
heaves
and
flows
down
almost
to
the
plain
but
rises
again
into
a
lesser
hill
with
woods
and
then
slowly
subsides
within
a
few
square
miles
it
collects
every
beauty
of
the
chalk
hill
its
central
height
is
a
dome
of
flawless
grass
only
too
tender
to
be
majestic
and
that
is
supported
by
lesser
rounds
and
wavering
lines
of
approach
in
concavity
and
convexity
playgrounds
for
the
godlike
shadows
and
lights
that
prolong
the
descent
of
the
spent
wave
of
earth
into
the
plain
an
uncertain
path
keeps
to
the
highest
ridge
the
sides
of
the
downs
are
invaded
by
long
coombes
of
which
the
narrow
floor
is
palest
green
grass
the
highest
points
command
much
of
earth
all
of
heaven
they
are
treeless
but
occasionally
the
turf
is
by
the
hoops
of
a
brier
thicket
the
new
foliage
pierced
by
upright
dead
grey
grass
they
are
the
haunt
of
the
swift
the
home
of
wheatear
and
lark
and
of
whatsoever
in
the
mind
survives
or
is
born
in
this
pure
kingdom
of
grass
and
sky
ahead
they
dip
to
a
river
and
rise
again
their
sweep
notched
by
a
white
road
at
the
inland
end
of
this
river
valley
is
an
antique
large
village
or
small
town
a
perfect
group
of
human
dwellings
as
inevitable
as
the
downs
dominated
by
a
mound
and
on
it
a
windmill
in
ruin
mothered
by
a
church
at
the

under

newly
wainscoted

the

filled
by
a
crinkled
blue

the

supports
a

there
are
pink
geraniums
in

of
a

orange
roofs
of

amidst
a
round
cluster
of

and
their
bells
the
road
alongside
but
above
the
river
dips
then
under
steep
banks
of
blackthorn
and
parsley
to
a
village
of
flint
where
another
spire
rises
out
of
the
old
roofs
of
a
farmhouse
and
its
family
of
barns
and
lodges
a
nightingale
sings
at

a

cries
and
gleams
over
the
blue
ripples
of
the
river
across
the

a
shallow
scoop
has
been
carved
by
nature
out
of
the
side
of

it
is
traversed
by
two
diverging
paths
which
alone
are
green
for
the
rest
of
the
surface
is
of
gorse
and
full
in
the

of
the
sun
forms
a
mossy
cirrus
over
the
mist
of
its
own
warm
shade
the
down
beside
the
road
is
now
all
cowslips
among
its
scattered
bramble
and
thorn
until
it
is
cloven
by
a
tributary
bay
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
length
marshy
at
first
and
by
elms
and
willows
but
at
its
higher
end
occupied
behind
ash
trees
and
an
orchard
by
a
farmhouse
a
circular
domed
building
and
a
barn
all
having
roofs
of
ochre
tile
except
the
thatched

singly
on
the

borders
of

a
concerted
whimper
of

a
little
beyond
is
a
larger
bay
of
the
same
kind
bordered
by
a
long
curving
road
entirely
lined
by
elms
dividing
it
from
the
broad
meadow
that
has
an
elm
rookery
in
a
corner
under
the
steep
clean
slope
of
down
at
the
end
is
a
church
singing
to
itself
with
all
its
bells
in
the
solitude
and
the
hedges
are
full
of
strong
young
thrushes
which
there
is
no
one
to
frighten
is
there
any
prettier
dress
than
the
speckled
feathers
of
their
breasts
and
the
cape
of
brown
over
their
shoulders
and
backs
as
they
stir
the
dew
in
may
then
the
valley
opens
wide
and
the
river
doubles
in
gleaming
azure
about
a
narrow
spit
of
grass
in
sight
of
a
sharp
white
fall
of
chalk
into
the
lucid
quiet
sea
at
this
bend
a
company
of
sycamores
girds
and
is
one
with
a
group
of
tiled
and
thatched
and
gabled
buildings
of
ochre
brown
and
rose
the
road
crosses
the
river
and
a
path
leads
near
the
sea
between
mustard
flower
lucerne
beans
corn
and
grass
in
fields
to
a
church
and
farm
of
flint
overtopped
by
embowering
chestnuts
ilex
and
the
elms
of
rooks
and
below
there
is
another
valley
and
river
a
green
pathless
marsh
at
whose
edge
five
noisy
belching
chimneys
stand
out
of
a
white
pit
the
path
over
turf
rises
to
the
downs
passing
a
lonely
flint
barn
with
rich
dark
roof
and
a
few
sycamores
for
mates
this
is
the
cornland
and
the
corn
bunting
sings
solitary
and
monotonous
and
the
linnets
twitter
still
in
flocks
above
and
around
the
furzy
coombes
are
the
home
of
blackbirds
that
have
a
wilder
song
in
this
world
of
infinite
corn
below
and
grass
above
and
but
one
house
violets
and
purple
orchis
and
its
white
buds
cloud
the
turf
on
the
other
side
the
downs
sink
to
gently
clustered
and
mounded
woods
and
yet
more
corn
surrounding
a
thatched
flint
barn
a
granary
and
and
again
a
farm
under
sycamores
the
grey
sky
of
is
slowly
moving
kindly
and
promising
rain
the
air
is
still
the
road
dusty
but
the
hedges
tender
green
and
the
grasshopper
lark
sings
under
the
wild
parsley
of
the
roadside
and
the
in
the
sallows
just
beyond
is
the
town
by
the
beautiful
domed
hill
a
town
of
steep
lanes
and
wallflowers
on
old
walls
and
such
a
date
as
modestly
inscribed
on
a
doorway
its
long
old
street
sternly
adapted
to
the
needs
of
shopkeepers
and
gentry
looks
only
its
age
being
as
much
repressed
as
if
it
were
a
kind
of
sin
or
originality
this
is
that
spirit
which
would
quarrel
with
the
stars
for
not
being
in
straight
lines
like
print
the
spirit
of
one
who
having
been
disturbed
while
shaving
by
the
sight
of
a
favourite
cat
in
the
midst
of
her
lovers
and
behaving
after
the
manner
of
her
kind
gives
orders
during
the
long
meal
that
she
shall
be
drowned
forthwith
or
no
which
is
monday
this
is
that
spirit
which
says
nature
is
never
stiff
and
none
recognizes
this
fact
better
than
son
and
their
now
and
rockeries
have
reclaimed
many
a
dreary
bit
of
landscape
at
they
showed
me
photographs
of
various
country
seats
where
the
scenery
has
been
evolved
by
their
artistic
taste
and
ingenuity
out
of
the
most
ordinary
efforts
of
nature
thus
a
dull
old
has
with
the
aid
of
rockeries
and
appropriate
vegetation
been
converted
into
a
wonderfully
picturesque
spot
an
ordinary
brook
was
transformed
into
a
lovely
woodland
scene
with
ferns
mosses
and
lichens
growing
among
the
rockeries
and
the
shores
of
an
uninteresting
lake
became
undulating
banks
of
beauty
by
the
same
means
while
the
beautiful
rockeries
in
park
were
also
the
work
of
this
firm
son
have
other
ways
too
of
beautifying
gardens
and
grounds
by
the
judicious
use
of
balustrades
fountains
quaint
figures
made
of
or
artificial
stone
which
is
far
more
durable
than
real
stone
or
marble
not
so
costly
and
impervious
to
frost
and
all
weathers
although
it
takes
the
vegetation
in
the
same
way
and
after
a
exposure
it
can
scarcely
be
distinguished
from
antique
stone
in
it
the
great
here
just
now
is
the
latest
craze
for
without
a
sundial
no
ancient
or
garden
is
considered
complete
nevertheless
the
town
smells
heartily
of
cattle
sheep
and
malt
a
rookery
and
white
orchard
confront
the
railway
station
and
in
the
midst
of
the
streets
the
long
grass
is
rough
and
wet
and
full
of
jonquils
round
ancient
masonry
seen
from
a
height
the
town
shares
the
sunlight
equally
with
massy
foliage
and
finds
its
place
as
a
part
of
nature
and
the
peregrine
takes
it
in
its
sweep
the
have
come
and
the
oaks
are
budding
bronze
in
the
weald
the
steep
roadside
banks
are
cloaked
in
grass
violet
and
primrose
still
and
and
stitchwort
and
cuckoo
flowers
and
the
talk
in
the
hazel
copses
a
brooklet
runs
in
a
hollow
that
would
almost
hold
the
thames
and
crossing
the
road
fills
a
rushy
deep
below
and
makes
a
field
all
golden
and
shining
with
marigold
just
beyond
a
gnarled
lime
avenue
leads
to
a
grey
house
of
stone
within
a
stately
park
opposite
the
gate
an
old
woman
sits
on
the
grass
her
feet
in
the
dust
at
the
edge
of
the
road
sprinkle
her
and
turn
her
black
to
drab
she
sits
by
the
wayside
eternally
expecting
nothing
turn
out
of
this
main
road
and
that
tempt
neither
cyclists
nor
motorists
go
almost
as
straight
here
is
no
famous
house
not
a
single
inn
or
church
but
only
the
unspoilt
weald
and
far
away
a
long
viaduct
that
carries
noiseless
trains
against
the
sky
above
hollow
meadows
bluebell
primrose
anemone
anemone
primrose
bluebell
star
and
cloud
the
lush
banks
and
the
roots
of
the
blackthorns
hazels
and
maples
of
the
hedge
a
stream
washes
the
roots
of
many
oaks
and
flows
past
flat
fields
of
dusky
grass
cuckoo
flower
and
marigold
black
pines
at
the
verge
the
light
smoke
of
a
roadside
fire
ascends
into
the
new
leaves
of
the
hazels
where
two
tramps
are
drying
their
clothes
many
oaks
are
down
and
lie
pale
and
gleaming
like
mammoth
bones
among
the
bluebells
in
plantations
roughened
by
old
flint
pits
the
faggots
of
oak
tops
and
cords
of
twisted
timber
are
being
made
up
the
woodmen
light
a
fire
and
the
chips
fly
from
the
axes
it
is
only
to
these
men
that
i
am
a
stranger
as
i
walk
through
the
land
at
first
i
admire
the
hardihood
and
simplicity
of
their
necessary
toil
among
the
oaks
but
they
lift
their
dark
eyes
and
then
it
is
as
strange
as
when
i
pass
a
white
embowered
house
and
the
road
is
muffled
with
straw
and
i
hear
by
chance
that
some
one
unknown
is
dying
behind
that
open
window
through
which
goes
the
song
and
the
homeward
chatter
neither
townsman
or
countryman
i
can
not
know
them
the
countryman
knows
their
trades
and
their
speech
and
is
of
their
kind
the
curiosity
wins
him
a
greeting
but
in
may
at
least
i
am
content
in
the
steep
little
valley
made
by
a
tributary
of
the
medway
its
sides
wooded
with
oak
and
the
flowers
glad
of
the
sun
among
the
lately
cleared
undergrowth
and
the
cuckoo
now
in
this
oak
and
now
in
that
and
the
whose
voices
in
the
soft
lulls
after
rain
make
the
earth
seem
to
lie
out
sleek
in
the
sun
stretching
itself
to
purr
with
eyes
closed
the
cuckoo
is
gone
before
we
know
what
his
cry
is
to
tell
us
or
to
remind
us
of
there
are
few
things
as
pleasant
as
the
thunder
and
lightning
of
may
that
comes
in
the
late
afternoon
when
the
air
is
as
solid
as
the
earth
with
stiff
grey
rain
for
an
hour
there
is
no
motion
anywhere
save
of
this
perpendicular
river
of
the
swaying
bough
and
quivering
leaf
but
through
it
all
the
thrushes
sing
and
jolly
as
their
voices
are
the
roars
and
echoes
of
the
busy
thunder
quarrying
the
cliffs
of
heaven
and
then
the
pleasure
of
being
so
wet
that
you
may
walk
through
streams
and
push
through
thickets
and
be
none
the
wetter
for
it
before
it
is
full
night
the
light
of
the
young
moon
falls
for
a
moment
out
of
a
troubled
but
silent
sky
upon
the
young
corn
and
the
tranquil
bells
are
calling
over
the
woods
then
in
the
early
morning
the
air
is
still
and
warm
but
so
moist
that
there
is
a
soul
of
coolness
in
the
heat
and
never
before
were
the
leaves
of
the
sorrel
and
wood
sanicle
and
woodruff
and
the
foliage
and
pallid
yellow
flowers
of
the
large
celandine
so
fair
the
sudden
song
is
shrewd
and
sweet
and
banishes
heaviness
the
huge
chestnut
tree
is
flowering
and
full
of
bees
the
parsley
towers
delicately
in
bloom
the
beech
boughs
are
encased
in
gliding
crystal
the
nettles
the
millions
of
nettles
in
a
bed
begin
to
smell
of
summer
in
the
calm
and
sweet
air
the
murmur
and
the
blackbirds
sing
as
if
time
were
no
more
over
the
mere
the
roads
nearly
dry
again
are
now
at
their
best
cool
and
yet
luminous
and
at
their
edges
coloured
rosy
or
golden
brown
by
the
sheddings
of
the
beeches
those
gloves
out
of
which
the
leaves
have
forced
their
way
pinched
and
crumpled
by
the
confinement
at
the
bend
of
a
broad
road
descending
under
beeches
these
parallel
lines
of
ruddy
chaff
give
to
two
or
three
days
in
the
year
a
special
and
exquisite
loveliness
if
the
weather
be
alternately
wet
and
bright
and
the
long
white
roads
and
virgin
beeches
are
a
temptation
what
quests
they
propose
they
take
us
away
to
the
thin
air
of
the
future
or
to
the
underworld
of
the
past
this
one
takes
us
to
the
old
english
sweetness
and
robustness
of
an
estate
of
large
meadows
sound
oak
trees
not
too
close
together
and
a
noble
house
within
an
park
a
poet
and
a
man
lives
there
one
who
recalls
those
other
poets
they
are
not
many
who
please
us
over
the
gulf
of
time
almost
as
much
by
the
personal
vigour
and
courage
which
we
know
to
have
been
theirs
or
is
suggested
by
their
work
men
like
chaucer
sidney
ben
jonson
drayton
byron
william
morris
and
among
the
living
and
and
i
think
we
should
miss
their
poems
more
than
some
greater
if
they
were
destroyed
they
stand
for
their
time
more
clearly
than
the
greatest
for
example
language
ideas
and
temper
make
it
impossible
for
us
to
read
his
work
no
matter
in
how
remote
a
study
or
garden
shut
out
from
time
and
change
without
feeling
that
he
and
all
those
who
rode
and
talked
and
were
young
with
him
are
skeletons
or
less
though
catullus
or
milton
may
be
read
with
no
such
feeling
chaucer
seems
to
remind
us
of
what
once
we
were
his
seems
a
golden
age
he
wrote
before
villon
had
inaugurated
modern
literature
with
the
cry
où
sont
les
neiges
before
men
appear
to
us
to
have
learned
how
immense
is
the
world
and
time
but
we
looking
back
with
the
help
of
this
knowledge
see
in
the
work
of
this
man
who
filled
a
little
nook
of
time
and
space
with
gaiety
something
apart
from
us
an
england
a
happy
island
which
his
verses
made
his
gaiety
bathes
the
land
in
the
light
of
a
golden
age
and
the
freshness
of
all
the
may
days
we
can
never
recover
he
a
lusty
life
in
his
lust
present
was
all
his
and
the
gaiety
is
no
less
in
the
sorrowful
passages
than
in
the
joyful
when
for
example
he
compares
the
subjection
of
the
fierce
proud
troilus
to
love
with
the
whipping
of
a
spirited
horse
when
he
uses
the
apparent
commonplace
about
age
creeping
in
as
still
as
upon
fresh
youth
when
he
exclaims
to
the
false
jason
have
at
thee
jason
now
thy
horne
is
blowe
or
cries
at
the
fate
of
children
allas
fortune
it
was
greet
crueltee
swiche
briddes
for
to
putte
in
swich
a
cage
even
in
piteous
cry
o
tendre
o
deere
o
yonge
children
myne
there
is
an
intimation
that
in
those
words
her
sorrow
is
being
spent
and
that
though
it
will
be
renewed
it
will
be
broken
up
by
joyfulness
many
times
before
her
death
for
as
laughter
is
assuredly
never
completed
by
a
sigh
so
there
is
something
hearty
in
his
tears
that
hints
of
laughter
before
and
after
his
was
a
sharp
surprising
sorrow
that
came
when
he
was
forced
to
see
the
suffering
of
lovely
humanity
he
is
all
gaiety
but
it
has
two
moods
sorrow
never
changes
him
more
than
shadow
changes
a
merry
brook
in
both
moods
he
seems
to
speak
of
a
day
when
men
had
not
only
not
so
far
outstripped
the
lark
and
nightingale
as
we
have
done
but
had
moments
when
their
joy
was
equal
to
the
above
the
grey
dew
of
may
dawns
and
thus
if
we
only
had
to
thank
chaucer
for
the
gaiety
which
is
left
behind
in
his
poems
as
the
straw
of
a
harvest
clings
to
the
thorns
of
a
narrow
lane
we
could
never
be
thankful
enough
i
feel
that
chaucer
was
the
equal
of
those
of
whom
he
wrote
as
homer
was
the
equal
of
achilles
and
odysseus
just
as
byron
was
the
peer
of
the
noblest
of
the
doges
and
of
the
ruined
emperor
whom
he
addressed
as
vain
froward
child
of
empire
say
are
all
thy
playthings
snatched
away
byron
is
one
of
the
few
poets
whose
life
it
was
ever
necessary
to
write
his
acts
were
representative
from
his
harrow
meditations
on
a
tomb
to
his
death
on
the
superb
pedestal
of
missolonghi
they
are
symbolic
his
life
explains
nearly
everything
in
his
poetry
the
life
and
the
poetry
together
make
an
incomparable
whole
most
lives
of
poets
stand
to
their
work
as
a
block
of
unhewn
marble
stands
to
the
statue
finished
and
unveiled
if
the
marble
is
not
as
much
forgotten
as
was
when
galatea
breathed
and
sighed
poetry
without
his
life
is
not
finished
but
with
it
it
is
like
a
statue
by
michael
angelo
or
rodin
that
is
actually
seen
to
grow
out
of
the
material
he
was
a
man
before
he
was
a
poet
other
poets
may
once
have
been
men
they
are
not
so
now
we
read
their
lives
after
their
poetry
and
we
forget
them
it
is
by
their
poetry
that
they
survive
blithe
or
pathetic
or
glorious
but
dim
ghosts
who
are
become
a
part
of
the
silence
of
libraries
and
hearts
they
are
dead
but
for
the
mind
that
enjoys
and
the
voice
that
utters
their
verse
i
had
not
the
smallest
curiosity
about
swinburne
when
he
was
alive
and
visible
when
i
think
of
him
i
think
of
rosamund
speaking
to
eleanor
or
tristram
to
isoud
he
has
given
up
his
life
to
them
but
with
byron
it
is
different
if
all
record
of
him
could
be
destroyed
more
than
half
of
him
would
be
lost
for
i
think
that
it
is
upon
the
life
and
the
portraits
and
the
echoes
that
are
still
reverberating
in
europe
that
we
found
our
belief
that
he
is
a
great
man
without
them
he
would
be
an
interesting
rhetorician
perhaps
little
more
there
are
finer
poems
than
his
but
the
poet
is
the
equal
of
that
wild
lover
and
of
the
great
king
who
slept
while
the
tale
was
told
and
shelley
too
is
an
immortal
sentiment
men
may
forget
to
repeat
his
verses
they
can
never
be
as
if
shelley
had
never
been
he
is
present
wherever
love
and
rapture
are
he
is
a
part
of
all
and
pure
audacity
of
the
intellect
and
imagination
of
all
rebellion
of
all
infinite
endeavour
and
hope
the
remembered
splendour
of
his
face
is
more
to
us
than
parliaments
one
strophe
of
his
odes
is
more
nourishing
than
a
rich
gold
under
those
oaks
in
may
i
could
wish
to
see
these
men
walking
together
to
see
their
gestures
and
brave
ways
it
is
the
poet
there
who
all
but
creates
them
for
me
but
only
one
can
i
fairly
see
because
i
have
seen
him
alive
and
speaking
others
have
sent
up
their
branches
higher
among
the
stars
and
plunged
their
roots
deeper
among
the
rocks
and
waters
but
he
and
chaucer
and
jonson
and
byron
have
obviously
much
plain
humanity
in
their
composition
they
have
a
brawn
and
friendliness
not
necessarily
connected
with
poetry
we
use
no
ceremony
as
we
do
with
some
other
poets
with
morris
when
we
read
the
days
have
slain
the
days
and
the
seasons
have
gone
by
and
brought
me
the
summer
again
and
here
on
the
grass
i
lie
as
erst
i
lay
and
was
glad
ere
i
meddled
with
right
and
with
wrong
or
the
end
of
in
the
then
we
turned
from
the
blossoms
and
cold
were
they
grown
in
the
trees
the
wind
westering
moved
till
over
the
threshold
back
fluttered
her
gown
and
in
the
dark
house
was
i
loved
there
is
a
humanity
of
this
world
and
moment
in
feeling
for
nature
with
which
no
other
except
can
be
compared
except
in
the
greatest
the
unaccomplished
things
in
of
there
is
no
in
the
literature
of
our
language
so
majestic
and
yet
so
tender
as
in
message
of
the
march
with
him
poetry
was
not
as
it
has
tended
more
and
more
to
be
in
recent
times
a
matter
as
exclusive
as
a
caste
he
was
not
or
but
a
man
on
close
terms
with
life
and
toil
with
the
actual
troublous
life
of
every
day
with
toil
of
the
hands
and
brain
together
in
short
a
citizen
he
was
one
whom
skarphedin
the
son
of
njal
of
bergthorsknoll
would
not
have
disdained
and
when
he
spoke
he
seemed
indignant
at
the
feebleness
of
words
one
that
should
have
used
a
sword
and
might
have
lamented
with
the
still
later
poet
the
spirit
stands
and
looks
on
infamy
and
unashamed
the
faces
of
the
pit
snarl
at
their
enemy
finding
him
wield
no
insupportable
light
and
no
whirled
edge
of
blaze
to
hit
backward
their
impudence
and
hammer
them
to
flight
although
ready
is
he
wearing
the
same
righteous
steel
upon
his
limbs
helmed
as
he
was
then
when
he
made
olden
war
yet
can
not
now
with
foulness
fiercely
deal
there
is
no
indignation
among
men
the
spirit
has
no
scimitar
wilt
thou
not
come
again
thou
godly
sword
into
the
hands
that
he
may
be
a
captain
of
the
lord
again
and
mow
out
of
our
lands
the
crop
of
wicked
men
o
for
that
anger
in
the
hands
of
spirit
to
us
o
righteous
sword
come
thou
and
clear
our
lands
o
fire
o
indignation
of
the
lord
from
and
by
lascelles
abercrombie
bitter
it
is
to
think
of
that
talk
and
laughter
of
shadows
on
the
long
lawns
under
those
oaks
for
though
their
shadows
are
even
yet
better
than
other
bone
or
blood
never
yet
did
dead
man
lift
up
a
hand
to
strike
a
blow
or
lay
a
brick
in
a
churchyard
behind
i
saw
the
tombstone
of
one
robert
page
born
in
the
year
here
in
sussex
and
dead
in
not
in
the
bay
of
spezzia
but
in
sussex
he
scared
the
crows
ploughed
the
clay
fought
at
waterloo
and
lost
an
arm
there
was
well
pleased
with
george
the
fourth
and
hoed
the
corn
until
he
was
dead
that
is
plain
sense
and
i
wish
i
could
write
the
life
of
this
exact
contemporary
of
shelley
that
is
quite
probably
his
great
granddaughter
of
ruddy
complexion
full
lips
large
white
teeth
black
speechless
eyes
dressed
in
a
white
print
dress
and
stooping
in
the
fresh
wind
to
take
clean
white
linen
out
of
a
basket
and
then
rising
straight
as
a
hazel
wand
on
tiptoe
her
head
held
back
and
slightly
on
one
side
while
she
pegs
the
clothes
to
the
line
and
praises
the
weather
to
a
she
is
seventeen
and
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
earth
now
at
the
coming
on
of
night
the
wind
has
carried
away
all
the
noises
of
the
world
the
lucid
air
under
the
hazels
of
the
lane
is
dark
as
if
with
dream
and
the
roadway
leads
glimmering
straight
on
to
a
crystal
planet
low
in
the
purple
of
the
west
i
can
not
hear
my
footsteps
so
full
charged
is
the
silence
i
am
no
more
in
this
tranquillity
than
one
of
the
trees
the
way
seems
paved
that
some
fair
spirit
may
pass
down
in
perfect
beauty
and
bliss
and
ease
the
leaves
will
hail
it
and
the
blue
sky
lean
down
to
bless
and
the
planet
lend
its
beams
for
a
path
suddenly
the
name
of
mary
is
called
by
some
one
invisible
mary
for
a
little
while
the
cry
is
repeated
more
loudly
but
always
sweetly
then
the
caller
is
entranced
by
the
name
by
the
sound
of
her
own
voice
and
the
silence
into
which
it
falls
as
into
a
well
and
it
grows
less
and
less
and
ceases
and
is
dead
except
in
the
brain
of
the
bearer
i
thought
of
all
the
music
to
ear
and
mind
of
that
sound
of
i
suppose
the
depth
of
its
appeal
is
due
to
its
place
at
the
beginning
of
the
word
or
rather
to
the
need
of
the
soul
which
gave
it
that
place
and
it
is
a
sound
as
dear
to
the
animals
as
to
us
since
the
ewe
hears
it
first
from
her
lamb
and
the
cow
from
her
calf
as
the
woman
from
her
child
it
is
the
main
sound
in
it
endears
even
sadness
by
its
presence
in
and
it
makes
melody
on
the
lips
of
friends
and
lovers
in
the
names
of
it
murmurs
autumnally
in
all
mellow
sounds
in
the
music
of
wind
and
insect
and
instrument
to
and
it
owes
a
meaning
as
deep
as
to
and
this
mild
air
could
bear
no
more
melodious
burden
than
the
name
that
floated
upon
it
and
sank
into
it
down
down
to
reveal
its
infinite
depth
mary
there
are
parks
on
both
sides
of
the
road
bounded
by
hedges
or
high
brick
walls
and
the
public
road
has
all
the
decorum
of
a
drive
for
a
mile
the
very
ivy
which
is
destined
to
adorn
the
goodly
wall
and
spread
into
forms
as
grand
as
those
at
godstow
nunnery
is
protected
by
wire
netting
doves
croon
in
the
oaks
underneath
hazel
and
birch
flicker
their
new
leaves
over
the
pools
of
bluebells
the
swallows
fly
low
over
every
tuft
of
the
roadside
grass
and
glance
into
every
bay
of
the
wood
and
then
out
above
the
white
road
from
which
they
rebound
suddenly
and
turn
displaying
the
white
rays
of
their
tails
now
and
then
a
gateway
reveals
the
park
the
ground
undulates
but
is
ever
smooth
it
is
of
the
mellow
green
of
late
afternoon
bronzed
oak
woods
bound
the
undulations
and
here
and
there
a
solitary
tree
stands
out
on
the
grass
and
shows
its
poise
and
complexity
with
the
added
grace
of
new
leaf
the
cattle
graze
as
on
a
painted
lawn
a
woman
in
a
white
dress
goes
indolent
and
stately
towards
the
rhododendrons
and
elms
the
scene
appears
to
have
its
own
sun
mellow
and
serene
that
knows
not
moorland
or
craggy
coast
or
city
only
a
thousand
years
of
settled
continuous
government
of
laws
of
armies
and
police
of
roadmaking
of
bloody
tyranny
and
tyranny
that
poisons
quietly
without
blows
could
have
wrought
earth
and
sky
into
such
a
harmony
it
is
a
thing
as
remote
from
me
here
on
the
dusty
road
as
is
the
green
evening
sky
and
all
its
tranquillity
of
rose
and
white
and
even
more
so
because
the
man
in
the
manor
house
behind
the
oaks
is
a
puzzle
to
me
while
the
sky
is
always
a
mystery
with
which
i
am
content
at
such
an
hour
the
house
and
lawns
and
trees
are
more
wonderfully
fortified
by
the
centuries
of
time
than
by
the
walls
and
gamekeepers
they
weave
an
atmosphere
about
it
we
bow
the
head
and
reverence
the
labour
of
time
in
smoothing
the
grass
mellowing
the
stone
and
the
manners
of
the
inhabitants
and
yet
an
inevitable
conflict
ensues
in
the
mind
between
this
respect
and
the
feeling
that
it
is
only
a
respect
for
surfaces
that
a
thousand
years
is
a
heavy
price
to
pay
for
the
maturing
of
park
and
house
and
gentleman
especially
as
he
is
most
likely
to
be
a
parasite
on
those
who
are
concerned
hours
a
day
about
the
difficulty
of
living
and
about
what
to
do
when
they
are
alive
no
it
is
the
alien
remote
appearance
of
the
house
and
land
serene
in
the
may
evening
light
which
creates
this
reverence
in
the
mind
it
is
not
feudalism
or
the
old
nobility
and
gentility
that
we
are
bowing
down
to
but
only
to
nature
without
us
and
the
dream
within
us
it
is
certainly
not
pure
envy
nor
yet
is
it
for
the
same
reason
as
made
borrow
reflect
when
he
saw
the
good
house
at
the
end
of
an
avenue
of
noble
oaks
near
llandovery
a
plain
but
comfortable
seat
with
wings
it
looked
south
down
the
dale
what
satisfaction
i
could
live
in
that
house
said
i
to
myself
backed
by
a
couple
of
thousand
a
year
with
what
gravity
could
i
sign
a
warrant
in
its
library
and
with
what
dreamy
comfort
translate
an
ode
of
lewis
glyn
cothi
my
tankard
of
rich
ale
beside
me
i
wonder
whether
the
proprietor
is
fond
of
the
old
bard
and
keeps
good
ale
were
i
an
irishman
instead
of
a
norfolk
man
i
would
go
in
and
ask
not
if
he
were
a
welshman
either
for
i
at
least
know
that
in
no
other
house
should
i
be
better
off
than
i
am
and
i
lack
the
confidence
to
think
i
could
make
any
use
of
his
income
i
would
as
soon
envy
a
tramp
because
he
has
no
possessions
or
a
navvy
because
he
walks
like
a
hero
as
he
pushes
a
heavy
trolley
before
him
his
loose
jacket
fitting
him
as
a
mane
fits
a
lion
to
envy
a
man
is
to
misunderstand
him
or
yourself
nor
yet
is
it
pure
admiration
that
is
what
i
feel
for
something
external
that
can
be
described
as
right
as
having
absolute
individuality
and
inevitableness
of
form
for
example
i
admire
certain
groups
that
are
the
result
of
what
we
call
chance
an
arrangement
of
fishing
boats
going
out
to
sea
first
one
then
at
a
long
interval
two
close
together
a
fourth
a
little
behind
and
then
by
ones
and
pairs
and
clusters
at
different
intervals
or
the
four
or
five
oaks
left
in
a
meadow
that
was
once
a
copse
or
the
fruit
fallen
on
autumn
rime
or
sunset
clouds
that
pause
darkly
along
the
in
a
way
that
will
never
be
seen
again
or
of
tragic
figures
at
such
a
moment
as
when
polyxena
among
the
grecian
youths
gave
her
throat
to
the
dagger
of
neoptolemus
and
fell
beautiful
in
death
no
those
houses
are
castles
in
spain
they
are
fantastic
architecture
we
have
made
them
out
of
our
spirit
stuff
and
have
set
our
souls
to
roam
their
corridors
and
look
out
of
their
casements
upon
the
sea
or
the
mountains
or
the
clouds
it
is
because
they
are
accessible
only
to
the
everywhere
wandering
irresistible
and
immortal
part
of
us
that
they
are
beautiful
there
is
no
need
for
them
to
be
large
or
costly
or
antique
the
poorest
house
can
do
us
a
like
service
in
a
town
for
example
and
in
a
suburb
i
have
had
the
same
yearning
when
on
a
fine
still
morning
of
may
or
june
in
streets
away
from
the
traffic
i
have
seen
through
the
open
windows
a
cool
shadowy
room
and
in
it
a
table
with
white
cloths
and
gleaming
metal
and
glass
laid
thereon
and
nobody
has
yet
come
down
to
open
the
letters
it
all
seems
to
be
the
work
of
spirit
hands
it
is
beautiful
and
calm
and
celestial
and
is
a
profound
pleasure
tinged
by
melancholy
to
see
it
gives
a
sense
of
fitness
for
what
for
something
undivined
imperfectly
known
guessed
at
or
hoped
for
in
ourselves
for
a
wider
and
less
tainted
beauty
for
a
greater
grace
or
it
may
not
be
a
house
at
all
but
a
five
miles
off
up
which
winds
a
white
road
in
two
long
loops
between
a
wood
and
the
turf
the
grass
is
smooth
and
warm
and
bright
at
the
summit
in
the
blue
noon
or
in
the
horizontal
sunbeams
each
stem
is
lit
so
that
the
hill
is
transmuted
into
a
glowing
and
insubstantial
thing
and
then
at
noon
or
evening
something
in
me
flies
at
the
sight
and
desires
to
tread
that
holy
ground
it
is
an
odd
world
where
everything
is
fleeting
yet
the
soul
desires
permanence
even
for
fancies
so
unprofitable
as
this
and
so
these
thoughts
at
the
sight
of
the
great
houses
mingle
with
the
thoughts
that
grow
at
twilight
and
fade
gradually
away
in
the
windless
night
when
the
sky
is
all
over
with
white
clouds
and
in
the
dark
vales
between
them
are
the
stars
then
for
it
is
saturday
follows
another
pleasure
of
the
umbrageous
white
country
roads
at
night
the
high
contented
voices
of
children
talking
to
father
and
mother
as
they
go
home
from
the
market
town
the
parents
move
silent
laden
the
children
flit
about
them
with
white
hats
or
pinafores
their
voices
travel
far
and
long
after
they
are
invisible
in
the
mist
that
washes
over
the
fields
in
long
white
firths
but
die
away
as
the
misty
night
blots
out
the
hills
the
clouds
the
stars
the
trees
and
everything
but
the
branches
overhead
and
the
white
parsley
flowers
floating
along
the
hedge
there
is
no
breath
of
wind
the
owls
are
quiet
the
air
is
full
of
the
scent
of
holly
flower
and
may
and
nettles
and
of
the
sound
of
a
little
stream
among
the
leaves
chapter

june
hampshire
the
golden
age
traherne
hampshire
now
day
by
day
indoors
and
out
of
doors
the
conquest
of
spring
proceeds
to
the
music
of
the
conquerors
one
evening
the
first
chafer
comes
to
the
lamp
and
his
booming
makes
the
ears
tremble
with
dim
apprehension
he
climbs
and
slow
up
the
curtain
supporting
himself
now
and
then
by
unfurling
his
wings
or
if
not
he
falls
with
a
drunken
moan
then
begins
to
climb
again
and
at
last
blunders
about
the
room
like
a
ball
that
must
strike
something
the
white
ceiling
the
white
paper
the
lamp
and
when
he
falls
he
rests
in
his
painful
climbing
he
looks
human
as
perhaps
a
man
looks
angelic
to
an
angel
but
there
is
nothing
lovelier
and
more
surprising
than
the
unfurling
of
his
pinions
like
a
magic
cloak
out
of
that
hard
mail
another
day
the
woods
in
a
hot
moist
air
first
attain
their
rich
velvet
mossiness
and
even
near
at
hand
the
all
smouldering
with
bloom
are
like
clouds
settled
on
the
earth
having
no
solidity
but
just
colour
and
warmth
and
pleasantness
the
chestnuts
bloom
on
the
old
tiles
the
vast
carapace
of
the
is
green
and
rosy
and
out
of
the
midst
of
it
grow
dandelions
and
grass
and
the
mass
of
black
mould
which
it
has
accumulated
in
a
century
bends
down
the
roof
the
is
past
before
we
are
sure
that
it
has
reached
its
fulness
day
after
day
its
warm
and
fragrant
snow
clouded
the
earth
with
light
and
yet
we
waited
thinking
surely
it
will
be
fairer
still
and
it
was
and
the
next
day
we
thought
the
same
and
we
were
careless
as
in
first
love
and
then
one
day
it
lay
upon
the
grass
an
empty
shell
the
vest
of
departed
loveliness
and
another
year
was
over
the
broad
grass
is
full
of
gold
or
it
is
sullen
silvery
under
a
burning
afternoon
sun
without
wind
the
horizon
smoky
the
blue
sky
and
its
white
still
clouds
almost
veiled
by
heat
the
red
cattle
are
under
the
elms
the
unrippled
water
slides
under
sullen
silvery
willows
the
peels
off
the
hills
and
lets
the
sun
in
upon
small
tracts
of
wood
upon
a
group
of
walnuts
in
the
bronze
of
their
fine
small
leaf
upon
downland
grass
and
exposes
blue
sky
and
white
cloud
but
then
returns
and
hides
the
land
except
that
the
dewy
and
the
ivy
and
holly
gleam
and
two
cuckoos
go
over
crying
and
crying
continually
in
the
hollow
vale
already
the
hang
in
cool
thick
bunches
under
the
darker
leaves
the
is
falling
the
are
large
and
rosy
the
wind
is
high
and
the
thunder
is
away
somewhere
behind
the
pink
mountains
in
the
southern
sky
or
in
the
dark
drifts
overhead
and
yet
the
blue
of
the
massy
hangers
almost
envelops
the
beechen
green
the
coombes
and
the
beeches
above
and
around
their
grassy
slopes
of
juniper
are
soft
and
dim
and
far
withdrawn
and
the
voice
is
heard
as
if
the
wind
there
were
quiet
the
rain
will
not
come
the
plunging
wind
in
the
trees
has
a
sound
of
waterfalls
all
night
yet
can
not
trouble
the
sleep
of
the
butterfly
on
the
dead
flower
now
the
pine
blooms
in
the
sandy
lands
above
the
brake
and
whortleberry
the
foxgloves
break
into
bell
after
bell
under
the
oaks
and
birches
the
yellow
broom
is
flowering
and
scented
and
the
white
bedstraw
sweetens
the
breath
the
careless
variety
of
abundance
and
freshness
makes
every
lane
a
bride
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
the
sand
deep
meadows
gleam
and
the
kingfisher
paints
the
air
with
azure
and
emerald
and
rose
above
the
massy
water
tumbling
between
aspens
at
the
edge
of
a
neat
shaven
lawn
and
behind
that
a
white
mill
and
house
with
dark
alluring
windows
where
no
one
stirs
june
puts
bronze
and
crimson
on

of
her
leaves
the
and

of
the
leaves
of

and
bramble
and
dogwood
are
rosy
the
are
the
and
parsley
are
the
leaves
of
ash
and
holly
are
dark
lacquered
the
copper
beeches
opulently
sombre
under
a
faintly
yellowed
sky
seem
to
be
the
sacred
trees
of
the
thunder
that
broods
above
presently
the
colour
of
the
threat
is
changed
to
blue
which
soiled
white
clouds
pervade
until
the
whole
sky
is
woolly
white
and
grey
and
moving
north
there
is
no
wind
but
there
is
a
roar
as
of
a
hurricane
in
the
trees
far
off
soon
it
is
louder
in
the
trees
not
so
remote
and
in
a
minute
the
rain
has
traversed
of
woods
and
the
distant
combined
roar
is
swallowed
up
by
the
nearer
pattering
on
roof
and
pane
and
leaf
the
dance
of
leaves
the
sway
of
branches
the
trembling
of
whole
trees
under
the
flood
the
rain
falls
straight
upon
the
hard
road
and
each
drop
seems
to
leap
upward
from
it
barbed
great
drops
dive
among
the
motionless
dusty
nettles
the
thunder
unloads
its
ponderous
burden
upon
the
resonant
floor
of
the
sky
but
the
sounds
of
the
myriad
leaves
and
drinking
all
but
drowns
the
boom
the
splitting
roar
and
the
echo
in
the
hills
when
it
is
over
it
has
put
a
final
sweetness
into
the
voice
and
into
the
calm
of
the
evening
garden
when
the
voice
of
a
singer
does
but
lay
another
tribute
at
the
feet
of
the
enormous
silence
frail
is
that
voice
as
the
dancing
above
the
grass
so
faithfully
that
it
seems
a
flower
attached
to
a
swaying
stem
or
as
the
one
that
flutters
in
a
draught
of
the
hedge
like
a
signalling
hand
while
all
the
rest
of
the
leaves
are
as
if
they
could
not
move
again
or
as
the
full
moon
that
is
foundering
on
a
white
surf
in
the
infinite
violet
sky
more
large
and
more
calm
and
emptier
of
familiar
things
grows
the
land
as
i
pass
through
it
under
the
hoverings
of
the
but
nightjar
until
at
midnight
only
a
low
white
mist
moves
over
the
gentle
desolation
and
warm
silence
the
mist
wavers
and
discloses
a
sky
all
strewn
with
white
stars
like
the
flowers
of
an
immense
jessamine
it
closes
up
again
and
day
is
born
unawares
in
its
pale
arms
and
earth
is
for
the
moment
nothing
but
the
tide
of
downs
flowing
west
and
the
branch
of
red
roses
that
hangs
heavily
laden
and
drowsed
with
its
weight
and
beauty
over
my
path
dipping
its
last
spray
in
the
dew
of
the
grass
the
day
is
a
sunday
and
no
one
is
on
foot
or
on
wheel
in
the
broad
arable
country
that
ripples
in
squares
of
green
or
brown
or
yellow
or
grey
to
the
green
downs
and
their
dark
woods
as
if
for
some
invisible
beholder
the
green
elders
and
their
make
their
harmony
with
the
barns
against
which
they
lean
the
grass
and
the
noble
trees
the
groups
of
wayside
aspen
the
line
of
the
on
both
sides
of
the
road
the
one
delicate
sycamore
before
the
inn
and
the
company
of
sycamores
above
the
cross
the
spacious
thatch
and
tiles
of
the
farmyard
quadrangle
the
day
newly
painted
in
white
and
blue
the
green
so
green
in
the
hedges
and
the
white
and
purple
so
pure
in
the
flowers
all
seem
to
be
meant
for
eyes
that
know
nothing
of
time
and
of
what
death
into
the
world
and
all
our
and
in
this
solitude
the
young
birds
are
very
happy
they
have
taken
possession
of
the
thick
hedges
of
the
roadside
grass
of
the
roads
themselves
they
flutter
and
run
and
stumble
there
they
splash
in
the
pools
and
in
the
dust
which
not
a
wheel
nor
a
foot
has
marked
these
at
least
are
admitted
into
the
kingdom
along
with
that
strange
wildfowl
that
lives
maintain
the
trade
and
mystery
of
such
a
day
in
the
unblemished
summer
land
invariably
calls
up
thoughts
of
the
golden
age
as
mankind
has
looked
back
to
a
golden
age
so
the
individual
repeating
the
history
of
the
race
looks
back
and
finds
one
in
his
own
past
historians
and
archæologists
have
indeed
made
it
difficult
for
men
of
our
time
to
look
far
back
for
a
golden
age
we
are
shown
a
skull
with
supraciliary
prominences
and
are
told
that
its
owner
though
able
to
survive
the
mammoth
by
means
of
tools
of
flint
lived
like
the
tasmanian
of
modern
times
and
his
was
no
golden
age
then
we
look
back
to
heroic
ages
which
poetry
and
other
arts
have
magnified
to
the
greece
of
homer
or
pheidias
to
the
ireland
of
cuchulain
to
the
wales
of
arthur
to
the
england
which
built
the
great
cathedrals
or
produced
chaucer
sir
philip
sidney
izaak
walton
in
the
same
way
few
men
can
now
look
back
to
their
childhood
like
traherne
and
say
that
appeared
new
and
strange
at
first
inexpressibly
rare
and
delightful
and
beautiful
i
was
a
little
stranger
which
at
my
entrance
into
the
world
was
saluted
and
surrounded
with
innumerable
joys
my
knowledge
was
divine
i
knew
by
intuition
those
things
which
since
my
apostasy
i
collected
again
by
the
highest
reason
my
very
ignorance
was
advantageous
i
seemed
as
one
brought
into
the
estate
of
innocence
all
things
were
spotless
and
pure
and
glorious
yea
and
infinitely
mine
and
joyful
and
precious
i
knew
not
that
there
were
any
sins
or
complaints
or
laws
i
dreamed
not
of
poverties
contentions
or
vices
all
tears
and
quarrels
were
hidden
from
mine
eyes
everything
was
at
rest
free
and
immortal
i
knew
nothing
of
sickness
or
death
or
rents
or
exaction
either
for
tribute
or
bread
all
time
was
eternity
and
a
perpetual
sabbath
is
it
not
strange
that
an
infant
should
be
heir
of
the
whole
world
and
see
those
mysteries
which
the
books
of
the
learned
never
unfold
of
by
thomas
traherne
dobell
we
blink
deliberately
or
not
unpleasant
facts
in
our
own
lives
as
in
the
social
life
of
greece
or
the
middle
ages
some
have
no
need
to
do
so
robustly
or
sensitively
made
their
childish
surroundings
have
been
such
as
to
meet
their
utmost
needs
or
to
draw
out
their
finest
powers
or
to
leave
them
free
ambition
introspection
remorse
had
not
begun
the
vastness
and
splendour
and
gloom
of
a
world
not
understood
but
seen
in
its
effects
and
hardly
at
all
in
its
processes
made
a
theatre
for
their
happiness
which
especially
when
seen
through
a
mist
of
years
glorify
it
exceedingly
and
it
becomes
like
a
ridge
of
the
downs
transfigured
in
golden
light
so
that
we
in
the
valley
sigh
at
the
thought
that
where
we
have
often
trod
is
heaven
now
such
beauties
of
the
earth
seen
at
a
distance
and
inaccessibly
serene
always
recall
the
equally
inaccessible
happiness
of
childhood
why
have
we
such
a
melting
mood
for
what
we
can
not
reach
why
as
we
are
whirled
past
them
in
a
train
does
the
sight
of
a
man
and
child
walking
quietly
beside
a
reedy
pond
the
child
stooping
for
a
flower
and
its
gossip
unheard
why
should
we
tremble
to
reflect
that
we
have
never
tasted
just
that
cloistered
balm
perhaps
the
happiest
childhoods
are
those
which
pass
completely
away
and
leave
whole
tracts
of
years
without
a
memory
those
which
are
remembered
are
fullest
of
keen
joy
as
of
keen
pain
and
it
is
such
that
we
desire
for
ourselves
if
we
are
capable
of
conceiving
such
fantastic
desires
i
confess
to
remembering
little
joy
but
to
much
drowsy
pleasure
in
the
mere
act
of
memory
i
watch
the
past
as
i
have
seen
workless
homeless
men
leaning
over
a
bridge
to
watch
the
labours
of
a
titanic
crane
and
strange
workers
below
in
the
ship
running
to
and
fro
and
feeding
the
crane
i
recall
green
fields
one
or
two
whom
i
loved
in
them
and
though
no
trace
of
such
happiness
as
i
had
remains
the
incorruptible
tranquillity
of
it
all
breeds
fancies
of
great
happiness
i
recall
many
scenes
a
church
and
churchyard
and
black
pigs
running
down
from
them
towards
me
in
a
rocky
lane
ladslove
and
tall
crimson
bitter
dahlias
in
a
garden
the
sweetness
of
large
moist
yellow
apples
eaten
out
of
doors
children
i
do
not
recall
happiness
in
them
yet
the
moment
that
i
return
to
them
in
fancy
i
am
happy
something
like
this
is
true
also
of
much
later
years
i
can
not
i
am
not
tempted
to
allow
what
then
spoiled
the
mingling
of
the
elements
of
joy
to
reappear
when
i
look
back
the
reason
perhaps
is
that
only
an
inmost
true
self
that
desires
and
is
in
harmony
with
joy
can
perform
these
long
journeys
and
when
it
has
set
out
upon
them
it
sheds
those
gross
incrustations
which
were
our
curse
before
many
are
the
scenes
thus
to
be
recalled
without
spot
or
stain
it
is
a
may
morning
warm
and
slightly
breezy
after
midnight
rain
in
the
the
trees
are
unloading
the
dew
which
drops
from
leaf
to
leaf
and
down
on
to
the
leaves
of
dark
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
the
privet
branches
are
bent
down
by
the
weight
of
raindrops
of
the
size
of
peas
the
dewy
white
stitchwort
stars
and
the
feathered
grasses
are
curved
over
on
the
banks
the
sainfoin
is
hoary
and
sparkling
as
i
move
already
the
sun
is
hot
and
the
sky
blue
with
faint
white
clouds
in
whirls
and
in
the
and

the
sings
a
subdued
note
of
rushing
bubbling
liquidity
as
of
some
tiny
brook
that
runs
in
quick
pulsations
among
the
the
head
is
uplifted
its
throat
is
throbbing
it
moves
restlessly
from
branch
to
branch
but
always
renews
its
song
on
the
new
perch
being
it
is
not
easily
seen
and
sometimes
through
this
continuous
jargon
the
small
wild
song
of
the
blackcap
is
heard
which
is
the
utmost
expression
of
moist
warm
dawns
in
may
thickets
of
and
earliest
roses
on
such
a
dawn
the
very
spirit
bathes
in

nuzzles
into
the
fragrance
with
delight
but
it
is
no
sooner
left
behind
with
may
than
it
has
developed
within
me
into
an
hour
and
a
scene
of
utmost
grace
and
bliss
save
that
i
am
in
it
myself
it
is
curious
too
how
many
different
kinds
of
eden
or
golden
age
nature
has
in
her
gift
as
if
she
silently
recorded
the
backward
dreams
of
each
generation
and
reproduced
them
for
us
unexpectedly
it
is
for
instance
an
early
morning
in
july
the
cows
pour
out
from
the
and
blot
out
the
smell
of
dust
with
their
breath
in
the
white
road
between
banks
of
hazel
and
thorn
the
boy
who
is
driving
them
to
the
pasture
calls
to
them
monotonously
persuasively
in
turn
as
each
is
tempted
to
crop

here
the

is
pillowed
with

there
more
fragrant
than
pines
with
the
brown
sheddings
of

and
here
thick
with
the
dry
scent
of

and

in
perfect
mingling
of
harebell
and

among

and

on
the
roadside

into
the
aftermath
of
the

and
the
long

to
their
lowing
after
them
up
the
road
comes
a
and
the
boy
hangs
on
the
gate
to
see
the
men
and
women
walking
upright
and
on
the
of
the
cart
the
words
sherwood
burley
these
things
also
propose
to
the
roving
unhistoric
mind
an
eden
one
still
with
us
one
that
is
passing
not
let
us
hope
the
very
last
some
of
these
scenes
whether
often
repeated
or
not
come
to
have
a
rich
symbolical
significance
they
return
persistently
and
as
it
were
ceremoniously
on
festal
days
but
meaning
i
know
not
what
for
example
i
never
see
the
flowers
and
foliage
of
growing
out
of
old
by
the
wayside
without
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
not
explained
by
a
long
memory
of
the
contrast
between
the
plant
and
the
raw
flint
so
also
with
the
drenched
leaning
out
over
high
walls
of
unknown
gardens
and
inland
cliffs
covered
with
beech
jutting
out
westward
into
a
bottomless
valley
in
the
mist
of
winter
twilights
in
silence
and
frost
something
in
me
belongs
to
these
things
but
i
hardly
think
that
the
mere
naming
of
them
will
mean
anything
except
to
those
many
perhaps
who
have
experienced
the
same
a
great
writer
so
uses
the
words
of
every
day
that
they
become
a
code
of
his
own
which
the
world
is
bound
to
learn
and
in
the
end
take
unto
itself
but
words
are
no
longer
symbols
and
to
say
or
is
not
to
call
up
images
of
a
hill
or
a
since
we
have
so
long
been
in
the
habit
of
using
the
words
for
beautiful
and
mighty
and
noble
things
very
much
as
a
uses
figures
without
seeing
gold
and
power
i
can
therefore
only
try
to
suggest
what
i
mean
by
the
significance
of
the
plant
in
the
the
wet
lilac
the
misty
cliff
by
comparing
it
with
that
of
scenes
in
books
where
we
recognize
some
power
beyond
the
particular
and
personal
all
of
don
acts
have
this
significance
so
have
the
end
of
story
of
and
the
opening
of
the
old
man
sitting
on
a
day
under
the
solitary
tree
to
tell
the
history
a
house
that
had
is
full
of
scenes
like
this
for
ten
centuries
from
the
battle
of
badon
to
the
writing
of
these
stories
were
alive
on
the
lips
of
many
kinds
of
men
and
women
in
many
lands
from
connemara
to
calabria
many
of
these
men
and
women
survive
only
in
the
turns
which
their
passionate
hearts
gave
to
these
ghostly
everlastingly
wandering
tales
artists
have
worked
upon
them
bards
have
sung
them
and
the
sound
of
their
harping
is
entangled
in
the
words
that
have
reached
us
this
blending
of
many
bloods
is
suggested
by
the
saracen
in
the
who
was
descended
from
hector
and
alexander
and
joshua
and
maccabæus
by
taliesin
whose
country
is
the
region
of
the
summer
stars
who
was
with
noah
and
alexander
and
at
the
birth
of
christ
and
thus
has
the
tale
become
so
full
in
the
ear
of
humanity
so
rich
in
scenes
designed
to
serve
only
an
immediate
purpose
yet
destined
by
this
grace
to
move
all
kinds
of
men
in
manifold
ways
such
is
the
in
dream
of
the
madness
of
tristram
when
he
ran
naked
in
the
wood
many
days
but
was
lured
by
the
music
of
a
damsel
playing
on
his
own
harp
the
speech
of
arthur
at
the
scattering
of
his
knights
in
the
sangraal
quest
fighting
with
the
black
knights
against
the
white
adventures
ending
at
the
castle
of
carbonek
where
he
put
on
all
his
arms
and
armour
and
went
the
moon
shone
between
the
lions
at
the
gate
and
forced
open
the
door
and
saw
the
vessel
covered
with
red
samite
and
many
angels
about
and
arthur
and
guenevere
watching
the
dead
elaine
in
the
barge
and
in
the
wars
of
arthur
and
launcelot
the
scene
opening
with
the
words
it
befell
upon
a
day
in
sir
launcelot
looked
over
the
walls
and
spake
on
high
unto
king
arthur
and
sir
gawaine
no
english
writer
has
expressed
as
well
as
traherne
the
spiritual
glory
of
childhood
in
which
wordsworth
saw
intimations
of
immortality
he
speaks
of
divine
light
wherewith
i
was
and
of
his
and
virgin
apprehensions
and
recommends
his
friend
to
pray
earnestly
for
these
gifts
will
make
you
angelical
and
wholly
it
was
by
the
that
he
saw
all
things
in
the
peace
of
eden
corn
was
orient
and
immortal
wheat
which
never
should
be
reaped
nor
was
ever
sown
i
thought
it
had
stood
from
everlasting
to
everlasting
the
dust
and
stones
of
the
street
were
as
precious
as
gold
the
gates
were
at
first
the
end
of
the
world
the
green
trees
when
i
saw
them
first
through
one
of
the
gates
transported
and
ravished
me
their
sweetness
and
unusual
beauty
made
my
heart
to
leap
and
almost
mad
with
ecstasy
they
were
such
strange
and
wonderful
things
the
men
o
what
venerable
and
reverend
creatures
did
the
aged
seem
immortal
cherubims
and
young
men
glittering
and
sparkling
angels
and
maids
strange
seraphic
pieces
of
life
and
beauty
boys
and
girls
tumbling
in
the
street
and
playing
were
moving
jewels
i
knew
not
that
they
were
born
or
should
die
but
all
things
abided
eternally
as
they
were
in
their
proper
places
eternity
was
manifest
in
the
light
of
the
day
and
something
infinite
behind
everything
appeared
which
tallied
with
my
expectation
and
moved
my
desire
yet
was
this
light
eclipsed
he
was
much
perverted
by
the
world
by
the
temptation
of
men
and
worldly
things
and
by
and
custom
not
any
corruption
or
depravation
of
for
he
tells
us
how
he
once
entered
a
noble
and
was
there
alone
see
the
gold
and
state
and
carved
imagery
but
wearied
of
it
because
it
was
dead
and
had
no
motion
a
little
afterwards
he
saw
it
of
lords
and
ladies
and
music
and
dancing
and
now
pleasure
took
the
place
of
tediousness
and
he
perceived
long
after
that
and
women
are
when
well
understood
a
principal
part
of
our
true
once
again
a
lowering
and
sad
evening
being
alone
in
the
field
when
all
things
were
dead
quiet
he
had
the
same
weariness
nay
even
horror
was
a
weak
and
little
child
and
had
forgotten
there
was
a
man
alive
in
the
nevertheless
hope
and
expectation
came
to
him
and
comforted
him
and
taught
him
he
was
concerned
in
all
the
that
he
was
in
all
the
was
the
great
source
of
comfort
and
joy
which
he
found
in
life
and
of
that
joy
which
his
book
pours
out
for
us
not
only
did
he
see
that
he
was
concerned
in
all
the
world
but
that
river
and
corn
and
herb
and
sand
were
so
concerned
god
he
says
infinite
in
each
of
these
things
seeth
how
it
relateth
to
angels
and
in
this
he
anticipated
of
he
seems
to
see
the
patterns
which
all
living
things
are
for
ever
weaving
he
would
have
men
strive
after
this
divine
knowledge
of
things
and
of
their
place
in
the
universe
he
came
to
believe
that
other
creatures
were
such
that
god
was
himself
in
their
creation
that
is
almighty
power
wholly
exerted
and
that
every
creature
is
indeed
as
it
seemed
in
my
infancy
not
as
it
is
commonly
yet
he
feels
the
superiority
of
soul
to
the
things
which
it
apprehends
soul
in
the
immensity
of
its
intelligence
is
greater
and
more
excellent
than
the
whole
even
so
richard
jefferies
prayed
that
his
soul
be
more
than
the
cosmos
of
the
soul
is
greater
than
the
whole
world
because
it
is
capable
of
apprehending
the
whole
world
because
it
is
spiritual
and
the
spiritual
nature
is
infinite
thus
traherne
was
led
to
the
splendid
error
of
making
the
sun
poor
little
dead
or
perhaps
it
was
a
figure
of
speech
used
to
convince
the
multitude
of
his
estimation
of
soul
as
above
all
visible
things
in
the
same
spirit
he
speaks
of
little
cottage
of
heaven
and
earth
as
too
small
a
gift
though
fair
for
beings
of
whom
he
says
we
know
and
feel
by
our
souls
and
feel
it
so
naturally
as
if
it
were
the
very
essence
and
being
of
the
and
again
with
childlike
simplicity
and
majesty
is
a
creature
of
such
noble
principles
and
severe
expectations
that
could
he
perceive
the
least
defect
to
be
in
the
deity
it
would
infinitely
displease
he
could
not
well
have
thought
of
man
except
loftily
since
he
was
himself
one
whom
imagination
never
deserted
imagination
the
greatest
power
of
the
mind
by
which
not
poets
only
live
and
have
their
being
god
says
he
made
you
able
to
create
worlds
in
your
own
mind
which
are
more
precious
unto
him
than
those
which
he
created
and
to
give
and
offer
up
the
world
unto
him
which
is
very
delightful
in
flowing
from
him
but
made
more
in
returning
to
that
power
to
create
worlds
in
the
mind
is
the
imagination
and
is
the
proof
that
the
creature
liveth
and
is
divine
unknown
he
says
a
secret
influence
on
the
soul
and
love
we
know
not
the
spirit
can
fill
the
whole
world
and
the
stars
be
your
jewels
never
enjoy
the
world
aright
till
the
sea
itself
floweth
in
your
veins
till
you
are
clothed
with
the
heavens
and
crowned
with
the
stars
and
perceive
yourself
to
be
the
sole
heir
of
the
whole
and
our
inheritance
is
more
than
the
world
men
are
in
it
who
are
every
one
sole
heirs
as
well
as
it
is
a
social
mysticism
world
he
says
in
another
place
serve
you
not
only
as
it
is
the
place
and
receptacle
of
all
your
joys
but
as
it
is
a
great
obligation
laid
upon
all
mankind
and
upon
every
person
in
all
ages
to
love
you
as
himself
as
it
also
magnifieth
all
your
his
is
the
true
mind
as
he
calls
it
is
not
he
says
in
another
place
is
not
a
man
in
the
whole
world
that
knows
god
or
himself
but
he
must
honour
you
not
only
as
an
angel
or
as
a
cherubim
but
as
one
redeemed
by
the
blood
of
christ
beloved
by
all
angels
cherubims
and
men
the
heir
of
the
world
and
as
much
greater
than
the
universe
as
he
that
possesseth
the
house
is
greater
than
the
house
o
what
a
holy
and
blessed
life
would
men
lead
what
joys
and
treasures
would
they
be
to
each
other
in
what
a
sphere
of
excellency
would
every
man
move
how
sublime
and
glorious
would
their
estate
be
how
full
of
peace
and
quiet
would
the
world
be
yea
of
joy
and
honour
order
and
beauty
did
men
perceive
this
of
themselves
and
had
they
this
esteem
for
one
another
here
as
in
other
passages
he
seems
to
advance
to
the
position
of
whitman
whom
some
have
blamed
for
making
the
word
of
no
value
because
he
would
apply
it
to
all
whereas
to
do
so
is
no
more
than
to
lay
down
that
rule
of
veneration
for
men
and
the
other
animals
which
has
produced
and
will
produce
the
greatest
revolutions
this
conception
of
universal
divinity
sprang
from
his
doctrine
of
love
by
love
we
can
be
at
one
with
the
divine
power
which
he
calls
god
he
says
the
true
means
by
which
the
world
is
enjoyed
our
love
to
others
and
love
to
why
even
the
love
of
riches
he
excuses
since
love
to
be
rich
that
we
thereby
might
be
more
greatly
and
just
as
richard
jefferies
says
that
felise
loved
before
ever
she
loved
a
man
so
traherne
says
violence
wherewith
a
man
sometimes
doteth
upon
one
creature
is
but
a
little
spark
of
that
love
even
towards
all
which
lurketh
in
his
nature
when
we
dote
upon
the
perfections
and
beauties
of
some
one
creature
we
do
not
love
that
too
much
but
other
things
too
it
is
this
love
by
which
alone
the
commonwealth
of
all
forms
of
life
can
be
truly
known
and
men
are
like
god
when
they
are
life
and
mettle
and
vigour
and
love
to
everything
and
and
in
all
things
his
feeling
of
the
interdependence
of
all
the
world
is
thus
inseparable
from
his
doctrine
of
love
love
inspires
it
by
love
alone
can
it
be
real
and
endure
that
is
in
all
and
with
all
can
never
be
and
nevertheless
he
can
not
always
be
thinking
of
the
universe
he
thought
that
the
sun
went
round
the
earth
and
just
as
he
regards
man
as
superior
to
other
forms
of
life
so
perhaps
he
has
a
filial
love
of
cottage
of
heaven
and
earth
the
brown
land
and
blue
sky
and
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
his
meditations
is
where
he
says
i
came
into
the
country
and
being
seated
among
silent
trees
and
meads
and
hills
had
all
my
time
in
mine
own
hands
i
resolved
to
spend
it
all
whatever
it
cost
me
in
the
search
of
happiness
and
to
satiate
that
burning
thirst
which
nature
had
enkindled
in
me
from
my
youth
in
which
i
was
so
resolute
that
i
chose
rather
to
live
upon
ten
pounds
a
year
and
go
in
leather
clothes
and
feed
upon
bread
and
water
so
that
i
might
have
all
my
time
clearly
to
myself
than
to
keep
many
thousands
per
annum
in
an
estate
of
life
where
my
time
would
be
devoured
in
care
and
labour
and
god
was
so
pleased
to
accept
of
that
desire
that
from
that
time
to
this
i
have
had
all
things
plentifully
provided
for
me
without
any
care
at
all
my
very
study
of
felicity
making
me
more
to
prosper
than
all
the
care
in
the
whole
world
so
that
through
his
blessing
i
live
a
free
and
a
kingly
life
as
if
the
world
were
turned
again
into
eden
or
much
more
as
it
is
at
this
traherne
is
remarkable
in
many
ways
but
for
nothing
more
than
for
his
mingling
of
man
and
nature
in
the
celestial
light
of
infancy
he
begins
indeed
with
the
corn
the
and
immortal
but
he
goes
on
to
the
dust
and
stones
and
gates
of
the
town
and
then
to
the
old
men
and
the
young
men
and
the
children
but
it
was
only
on
gilded
cloud
or
that
vaughan
saw
shadows
of
he
longs
to
travel
back
to
his
childish
time
and
to
a
city
of
the
soul
but
a
shady
city
of
wordsworth
though
he
says
that
common
was
in
celestial
in
his
early
childhood
only
mentions
grove
and
it
is
a
tree
a
single
field
a
flower
that
reminds
him
of
his
loss
it
is
the
fountains
meadows
hills
and
groves
which
he
is
anxious
to
assure
of
his
lasting
love
perhaps
many
memories
in
this
kind
are
of
nature
more
than
of
men
even
the
social
lamb
is
at
his
deepest
in
recalling
the
child
who
was
solitary
in
the
great
house
and
garden
of
blakesmoor
with
some
the
reason
for
this
priority
of
nature
is
that
her
solitudes
are
the
most
rich
the
presence
of
other
children
and
of
adults
is
comparatively
commonplace
and
in
becoming
permanently
or
temporarily
part
of
a
community
the
spirit
makes
some
sacrifice
provided
then
that
a
child
is
happy
and
at
ease
in
the
solitude
of
nature
it
is
more
open
than
in
company
to
what
is
afterwards
regarded
as
spiritual
intercourse
but
above
all
our
memories
of
nature
are
seldom
or
never
flawed
by
the
seeming
triviality
the
dislikes
the
disgusts
the
misunderstandings
which
give
to
memories
of
human
society
something
of
dulness
and
the
commonplace
thinking
of
ourselves
and
other
children
we
may
also
think
of
things
which
make
idealization
impossible
thinking
of
ourselves
in
a
great
wood
or
field
of
flowers
ever
so
long
ago
it
is
hard
not
to
exaggerate
whatever
there
was
between
the
spirit
of
the
child
and
the
vast
pure
forces
of
the
sun
and
the
wind
in
those
days
we
did
not
see
a
tree
as
a
column
of
a
dark
stony
substance
supporting
a
number
of
green
wafers
that
live
scarcely
half
a
year
and
grown
for
the
manufacture
of
furniture
gates
and
many
other
things
but
we
saw
something
quite
unlike
ourselves
large
gentle
of
foreign
tongue
without
locomotion
yet
full
of
the
life
and
movement
and
sound
of
the
leaves
themselves
and
also
of
the
light
of
the
birds
and
of
the
insects
and
they
were
givers
of
a
clear
deep
joy
that
can
not
be
expressed
the
brooding
mind
easily
exalts
this
joy
with
the
help
of
the
disillusions
and
the
knowledge
and
the
folly
and
the
thought
of
later
years
a
little
time
ago
i
heard
of
the
death
of
one
whom
i
had
once
seemed
to
know
well
had
roamed
and
talked
and
been
silent
with
him
and
i
should
have
gone
on
doing
so
had
he
not
gone
far
away
and
died
and
when
i
heard
of
his
death
i
kept
on
recalling
his
face
and
figure
to
my
mind
under
familiar
conditions
in
the
old
rooms
by
the
same
river
under
the
same
elms
as
before
i
saw
him
in
the
clothes
which
he
used
to
wear
smiling
or
laughing
or
perhaps
grim
but
wherever
he
was
and
whatever
his
look
there
was
always
something
the
shadow
of
a
shadow
but
awful
in
his
face
which
made
me
feel
that
had
i
only
seen
it
and
i
felt
that
i
ought
to
have
seen
it
in
those
days
i
should
have
known
he
was
to
die
early
with
ambitions
unfulfilled
far
away
and
in
this
same
way
will
the
brain
work
in
musing
of
earlier
times
all
that
has
come
after
deepens
that
candid
brow
of
the
child
as
a
legend
will
darken
a
bright
brook
i
once
saw
a
girl
of
seven
or
eight
years
walking
alone
down
a
long
grassy
path
in
an
old
garden
on
one
hand
rose
a
peaceful
long
slope
of
down
on
the
other
beyond
the
filberts
a
high
hedge
shut
out
all
but
the
pale
blue
sky
with
white
clouds
resting
on
its
lower
mist
like
on
a
still
pool
turning
her
back
to
the
gabled
house
and
its
attendant
beeches
she
walked
upon
the
narrow
level
path
of
perfect
grass
the
late
afternoon
sun
fell
full
upon
her
upon
her
brown
head
and
her
blue
tunic
and
upon
the
flowers
of
the
borders
at
either
side
the
lowly
white
arabis
foaming
wild
the
pansy
the
white
narcissus
the
yellow
jonquil
and
daffodil
the
darker
smouldering
wallflowers
the
tall
yellow
the
tufts
of
honesty
among
the
still
dewy
leaves
of
larkspur
and
columbine
but
here
and
there
as
she
walked
the
light
was
dimmed
by
the
clusters
of
cool
white
humming
hanging
out
of
the
hot
sky
in
front
of
her
the
seemed
to
meet
and
make
a
corridor
of
dark
stems
on
either
hand
paved
green
and
white
and
gold
and
roofed
by
milky
white
clouds
that
embowered
the
clear
wild
warble
of
farther
on
the
flowers
ceased
and
the
grass
was
shadowed
by
beeches
and
at
length
involved
in
an
uncertain
mist
of
trees
and
shadows
of
trees
and
there
the
cuckoo
cried
for
the
child
there
was
no
end
to
the
path
she
walked
slowly
at
first
picking
a
narcissus
or
two
or
stooping
to
smell
a
flower
and
letting
her
hair
fall
over
it
to
the
ground
but
soon
she
was
content
only
to
brush
the
tips
of
the
flowers
with
her
outstretched
hands
or
rising
on
tiptoe
to
force
her
head
up
amongst
the
lowest
branches
of
then
she
did
nothing
at
all
but
gravely
walk
on
into
the
shadow
and
into
eternity
dimly
foreknowing
her
days
she
looked
forward
as
one
day
she
would
look
back
over
a
broad
sea
of
years
and
in
a
drowsy
haunted
gloom
full
of
the
note
saw
herself
going
always
on
and
on
among
the
interlacing
shadows
of
tree
trunks
and
branches
and
joys
and
pleasures
and
pains
and
sorrows
that
must
have
an
end
she
knew
not
how
she
stopped
not
venturing
into
that
strange
future
under
the
beeches
she
stared
into
the
mist
where
hovered
the
phantoms
of
the
big
girl
the
young
woman
the
lover
which
in
turn
she
was
to
become
under
the
last
something
went
out
of
her
into
the
shadow
and
those
phantoms
fed
upon
her
blood
as
she
stood
still
but
presently
in
the
long
beech
corridors
the
gloom
began
to
lighten
and
move
and
change
to
a
glinting
blue
that
approached
her
shouted
the
peacock
now
close
at
hand
as
he
passed
her
by
and
turning
she
also
shouted
frightening
the
cuckoo
from
the
beeches
as
she
ran
back
among
the
flowers
to
the
house
what
is
to
come
of
our
in
schools
what
does
it
aim
at
whence
does
it
arise
in
part
no
doubt
it
is
due
to
our
desire
to
implant
information
it
is
all
very
well
for
the
poet
to
laugh
when
science
has
discovered
something
more
we
shall
be
happier
than
we
were
before
but
that
is
the
road
we
are
on
at
a
high
rate
of
speed
if
we
are
fortunate
we
shall
complete
our
inventory
of
the
contents
of
heaven
and
earth
by
the
time
when
the
last
man
or
woman
wearing
the
last
pair
of
spectacles
has
decided
that
after
all
it
is
a
very
good
world
and
one
which
it
is
quite
possible
to
live
in
that
however
is
an
end
which
would
not
in
itself
be
a
sufficient
inducement
to
push
on
towards
it
still
less
can
such
a
vision
have
set
us
upon
the
road
three
things
perhaps
have
more
particularly
persuaded
us
to
pay
our
fare
and
mount
for
somewhere
three
things
which
are
really
not
to
be
sharply
distinguished
though
it
is
convenient
to
consider
them
separately
first
the
literary
and
philosophical
movement
imperfectly
described
as
the
romantic
revival
and
return
to
nature
of
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
poets
and
philosophers
need
private
incomes
state
porridge
and
what
not
but
literature
and
philosophy
is
a
force
and
for
a
century
it
has
followed
a
course
which
was
entered
in
the
period
of
the
french
revolution
this
literature
shows
man
in
something
like
his
true
position
in
an
infinite
universe
and
shows
him
particularly
in
his
physical
environment
of
sea
sky
mountain
rivers
woods
and
other
animals
second
the
enormous
astonishing
perhaps
excessive
growth
of
towns
from
which
the
only
immediate
relief
is
the
pure
air
and
sun
of
the
country
a
relief
which
is
sought
by
the
urban
multitudes
in
large
but
insufficient
numbers
and
for
too
short
a
time
third
the
triumph
of
science
of
systematized
observation
helped
no
doubt
by
the
force
of
industrialism
to
which
it
gave
help
in
return
science
has
had
a
great
triumph
at
one
time
it
was
supposed
to
have
fatally
undermined
poetry
romance
religion
because
it
had
confused
the
minds
of
some
poets
and
critics
these
three
things
considered
is
inevitable
literature
sends
us
to
nature
principally
for
joy
joy
of
the
senses
of
the
whole
frame
of
the
contemplative
mind
and
of
the
soul
joy
which
if
it
is
found
complete
in
these
several
ways
might
be
called
religious
science
sends
us
to
nature
for
knowledge
industrialism
and
the
great
town
sends
us
to
nature
for
health
that
we
may
go
on
manufacturing
efficiently
or
if
we
think
right
and
have
the
power
that
we
may
escape
from
it
but
it
would
be
absurd
to
separate
joy
knowledge
and
health
except
as
we
separate
for
convenience
those
things
which
have
sent
us
out
to
seek
for
them
and
if
it
is
good
will
never
overlook
one
of
these
three
joy
through
knowledge
on
a
foundation
of
health
is
what
we
appear
to
seek
there
is
no
longer
any
need
to
hesitate
in
speaking
of
joy
in
connection
with
schools
yet
might
we
not
still
complain
as
thomas
traherne
did
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
was
never
a
tutor
that
did
professly
teach
felicity
though
that
be
the
mistress
of
all
other
sciences
nor
did
any
of
us
study
these
things
but
as
aliena
which
we
ought
to
have
studied
as
our
enjoyments
we
studied
to
inform
our
knowledge
but
knew
not
for
what
end
we
so
studied
and
for
lack
of
aiming
at
a
certain
end
we
erred
in
the
if
we
can
not
somehow
have
a
professor
of
felicity
we
are
undone
perhaps
nature
herself
will
aid
her
presence
will
certainly
make
for
felicity
by
enlarging
her
pupil
for
a
time
from
the
cloistered
life
which
modern
towns
and
their
infinite
conveniences
and
servitudes
encourage
tolstoy
has
said
that
in
the
open
air
relations
are
formed
between
pupil
and
teacher
freer
simpler
and
more
and
certainly
his
walk
on
a
winter
night
with
his
pupils
chatting
and
telling
tales
see
school
at
yasnaya
by
leo
tolstoy
leaves
an
impression
of
electrical
activity
and
felicity
in
the
young
and
old
minds
of
that
party
which
is
hardly
to
be
surpassed
and
how
more
than
by
noble
and
uncontaminated
forms
can
a
sense
of
beauty
be
nourished
then
too
the
reading
of
great
poetry
might
well
be
associated
with
the
study
of
nature
since
there
is
no
great
poetry
which
can
be
dissevered
from
nature
while
modern
poets
have
all
dipped
their
pens
in
the
sunlight
and
wind
and
great
waters
and
appeal
most
to
those
who
most
resemble
them
in
their
loves
the
great
religious
books
handed
down
to
us
by
people
who
lived
in
closer
intercourse
with
nature
than
many
of
us
can
not
be
understood
by
indoor
children
and
adults
whether
connected
with
this
or
that
form
of
religion
or
not
whether
taken
as
of
or
not
the
most
profound
and
longest
remembered
feelings
are
often
those
derived
from
the
contact
of
nature
with
the
mind
of
health
though
there
are
exactly
as
many
physicians
as
patients
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
anything
except
that
one
of
the
pieces
of
knowledge
i
do
not
speak
of
information
which
science
has
left
to
us
is
that
movement
and
the
working
of
the
brain
in
pure
air
and
sunlight
is
good
for
body
and
soul
especially
if
joy
is
aiding
knowledge
aids
joy
by
discipline
by
increasing
the
sphere
of
enjoyment
by
showing
us
in
animals
in
plants
for
example
what
life
is
how
our
own
is
related
to
theirs
showing
us
in
fact
our
position
responsibilities
and
debts
among
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
earth
pursued
out
of
doors
where
those
creatures
moving
and
still
have
their
life
and
their
beauty
knowledge
is
real
the
senses
are
invited
there
to
the
subtlest
and
most
delightful
training
and
have
before
them
an
immeasurable
fresh
field
not
a
field
like
that
of
books
full
of
old
opinions
but
one
with
which
every
eye
and
brain
can
have
new
vital
intercourse
it
is
open
to
all
to
make
discoveries
as
to
the
forms
and
habits
of
things
and
care
should
be
taken
to
preserve
the
child
from
the
most
verbose
part
of
modern
literature
that
which
repeats
in
multiplied
words
stale
descriptions
of
birds
and
flowers
coupled
with
trivial
fancies
and
insincere
inventions
let
us
not
take
the
study
the
lamp
and
the
ink
out
of
doors
as
we
used
to
take
wild
life
having
killed
it
and
placed
it
in
spirits
of
wine
indoors
let
us
also
be
careful
to
have
knowledge
as
well
as
enthusiasm
in
our
masters
enthusiasm
alone
is
not
enthusiasm
there
must
at
some
stage
be
some
anatomy
classification
pure
the
teacher
must
be
the
equal
in
training
of
the
mathematician
and
he
must
be
alive
which
i
never
heard
was
a
necessity
for
mathematicians
but
not
anatomy
for
all
perhaps
for
some
it
might
be
impossible
and
a
study
of
colours
curves
perfumes
voices
a
thousand
things
might
be
substituted
for
it
yet
is
not
designed
to
produce
naturalists
any
more
than
music
is
taught
in
order
to
make
musicians
if
you
produce
nothing
but
naturalists
you
fail
and
you
will
produce
very
few
the
aim
of
study
is
to
widen
the
culture
of
child
and
man
to
do
systematically
what
mark
pattison
tells
us
in
his
dry
way
he
did
for
himself
by
walking
and
outdoor
sports
then
at
the
late
age
of
seventeen
by
collecting
and
reading
such
books
as
natural
history
of
and
finally
by
a
slow
process
of
transition
from
natural
history
into
more
abstract
poetic
emotion
a
conscious
and
declared
poetical
sentiment
and
a
devoted
reading
of
the
geology
did
not
come
for
another
ten
years
complete
the
cycle
of
thought
and
to
give
that
intellectual
foundation
which
is
required
to
make
the
testimony
of
the
eye
roaming
over
an
undulating
surface
fruitful
and
satisfying
when
i
came
in
after
years
to
read
i
recognized
as
if
it
were
my
own
history
which
was
being
told
the
steps
by
which
the
love
of
the
country
boy
for
his
hills
and
moors
grew
into
poetical
susceptibility
for
all
imaginative
presentations
of
beauty
in
every
the
botany
would
naturally
be
related
to
the
neighbourhood
of
school
or
home
for
there
is
no
parish
or
district
of
which
it
might
not
be
said
as
jefferies
and
thoreau
each
said
of
his
own
that
it
is
a
microcosm
by
this
means
the
natural
history
may
easily
be
linked
to
a
preliminary
study
of
hill
and
valley
and
stream
the
positions
of
houses
mills
and
villages
and
the
reasons
for
them
and
the
food
supply
and
so
on
and
this
in
turn
leads
on
to
nay
involves
all
that
is
most
real
in
geography
and
history
the
landscape
retains
the
most
permanent
marks
of
the
past
and
a
wise
examination
of
it
should
evoke
the
beginnings
of
the
majestic
sentiment
of
our
oneness
with
the
future
and
the
past
just
as
natural
history
should
help
to
give
the
child
a
sense
of
oneness
with
all
forms
of
life
to
put
it
at
its
lowest
some
such
cycle
of
knowledge
is
needed
if
a
generation
that
insists
more
and
more
on
living
in
the
country
or
spending
many
weeks
there
is
not
to
be
bored
or
to
be
compelled
to
entrench
itself
behind
the
imported
amusements
of
the
town
chapter
ix
history
and
the
parish
hampshire
cornwall
some
day
there
will
be
a
history
of
england
written
from
the
point
of
view
of
one
parish
or
town
or
great
house
not
until
there
is
such
a
history
will
all
our
accumulations
of
information
be
justified
it
will
begin
with
a
geological
picture
something
large
clear
architectural
not
a
mass
of
insignificant
names
it
must
be
imaginative
it
might
perhaps
lean
sometimes
upon
in
the
peculiar
combination
of
soil
and
woodland
and
water
determines
the
direction
and
position
and
importance
of
the
ancient
trackways
it
will
determine
also
the
position
and
size
of
the
human
settlements
the
early
marks
of
these
the
old
flint
and
metal
implements
the
tombs
the
signs
of
agriculture
the
encampments
the
dwellings
will
have
to
be
clearly
described
and
interpreted
legend
must
be
learnedly
but
bravely
and
humanly
used
so
that
the
historian
who
has
not
the
extensive
sympathy
and
imagination
of
a
great
novelist
will
have
no
chance
of
success
what
endless
opportunities
will
he
have
for
really
giving
life
to
past
times
in
such
matters
as
the
line
made
by
the
edge
of
an
old
wood
with
the
cultivated
land
the
shapes
of
the
fields
with
their
borders
of
streams
or
hedge
or
copse
or
pond
or
wall
or
road
the
purpose
and
interweaving
of
the
roads
and
footpaths
that
suggest
the
great
permanent
thoughts
and
the
lesser
thoughts
and
dreams
of
the
brain
as
the
historic
centuries
are
reached
the
action
of
great
events
battles
laws
roads
invasions
upon
the
parish
and
of
the
parish
upon
them
must
be
shown
architecture
with
many
of
its
local
characteristics
still
to
be
traced
will
speak
as
a
voice
out
of
the
stones
of
castle
church
manor
farm
barn
and
bridge
the
birds
and
beasts
can
not
be
left
out
the
names
of
the
local
families
gentle
and
simple
what
histories
are
in
them
in
the
curt
parish
registers
in
tombstones
in
the
names
of
fields
and
houses
and
woods
better
a
thousand
errors
so
long
as
they
are
human
than
a
thousand
truths
lying
like
broken
round
the
anvil
of
a
thrush
if
only
those
poems
which
are
could
be
translated
at
last
the
pretty
the
odd
the
romantic
the
racy
names
of
copse
and
field
and

and

what
a

there
is
about
the

then
there
are
the
histories
of
roads
every
traveller
in
hampshire
remembers
the
road
that
sways
with
airy
motion
and
curves
down
from
the
high
land
of
clay
and
flint
through
the
chalk
to
the
sand
and
the
river
it
doubles
round
the
head
of
a
coombe
and
the
whole
descent
is
through
beech
woods
uninterrupted
and
all
but
impenetrable
to
the
eye
above
or
below
except
where
once
or
twice
it
looks
through
an
arrow
slit
to
the
blue
vale
and
the
castled
promontory
of
chanctonbury
twenty
miles
as
the
road
is
a
mere
ledge
on
the
side
of
a
very
steep
hill
the
woods
below
it
hurry
down
to
a
precipitous
pit
full
of
the
glimmering
trembling
and
murmuring
of
innumerable
leaves
and
no
sight
or
sound
of
men
it
is
said
to
have
been
made
more
than
half
a
century
ago
to
take
the
place
of
the
rash
straight
coach
road
which
now
enters
it
near
its
base
a
narrow
and
disused
track
joining
it
more
than
down
suggests
that
the
lower
part
was
made
by
the
widening
of
an
old
road
but
much
of
the
upper
half
is
new
certainly
the
road
as
it
now
is
broad
and
gently
bending
round
the
steep
coombe
is
new
and
it
was
made
at
the
expense
of
the
last
of
a
family
which
had
long
owned
the
manor
house
near
the
entrance
of
the
coombe
his
were
all
the
hanging
beech
woods
huge
as
the
sky
upon
the
hill
and
through
them
the
conducted
this
noble
and
pleasant
way
but
near
the
top
they
deviated
by
a
few
yards
into
another
estate
the
owner
would
not
give
way
a
lawsuit
was
begun
and
it
was
not
over
when
the
day
came
for
the
road
to
be
open
for
traffic
according
to
the
contract
or
if
not
to
pass
out
of
the
hands
the
day
passed
the
contract
was
broken
the
speculation
had
failed
and
the
tolls
would
never
fill
the
pockets
of
the
lord
of
the
manor
he
was
ruined
and
left
his
long
white
house
by
the
rivulet
and
its
chain
of
pools
his
farms
and
cottages
his
high
fruit
walls
his
uncounted
beeches
the
home
of
a
hundred
owls
his
spanish
chestnuts
above
the
rocky
lane
his
and
sycamore
stately
in
groups
his
mighty
wych
elms
his
apple
trees
and
all
their
mistletoe
his
walnut
trees
and
the
long
bay
of
sky
that
was
framed
by
his
tall
woods
east
and
north
and
west
there
are
many
places
which
nobody
can
look
upon
without
being
consciously
influenced
by
a
sense
of
their
history
it
is
a
battlefield
and
the
earth
shows
the
scars
of
its
old
wounds
or
a
castle
or
cathedral
of
distinct
renown
rises
among
the
oaks
or
a
manor
house
or
cottage
or
tomb
or
woodland
walk
that
speaks
of
a
dead
poet
or
soldier
then
according
to
the
extent
or
care
of
our
reading
and
the
clearness
of
our
imagination
we
can
pour
into
the
groves
or
on
the
turf
tumultuous
or
silent
armies
or
solitary
man
or
woman
it
is
a
coast
the
spring
tide
gnaws
the
yellow
cliff
and
the
wind
files
it
with
unceasing
hiss
and
the
relics
of
every
age
skull
and
weapon
and
shroudpin
and
coin
and
carven
stone
are
spread
out
upon
the
clean
untrodden
sand
and
the
learned
the
imaginative
the
fanciful
the
utterly
unhistoric
and
merely
human
man
exercises
his
spirit
upon
them
and
responds
if
only
for
a
moment
in
some
places
history
has
wrought
like
an
earthquake
in
others
like
an
ant
or
mole
everywhere
permanently
so
that
if
we
but
knew
or
cared
every
swelling
of
the
grass
every
wavering
line
of
hedge
or
path
or
road
were
an
inscription
brief
as
an
epitaph
in
many
languages
and
characters
but
most
of
us
know
only
a
few
of
these
unspoken
languages
of
the
past
and
only
a
few
words
in
each
wars
and
parliaments
are
but
dim
soundless
and
formless
happenings
in
the
brain
toil
and
passion
of
generations
produce
only
an
enriching
of
the
light
within
the
glades
and
a
solemnizing
of
the
shadows
out
of
a
whole
century
or
age
we
remember
nothing
vividly
and
in
a
manner
that
appeals
to
the
eye
except
some
such
picture
as
that
which
gerald
of
wales
gives
of
a
welsh
prince
cyneuric
son
of
rhys
he
was
tall
and
handsome
his
hair
curled
his
dress
was
a
thin
cloak
and
under
that
a
shirt
his
legs
and
feet
being
bare
regardless
of
thistle
and
brier
a
man
to
whom
nature
and
not
art
had
given
his
beauty
and
comely
bearing
outside
wales
and
in
ages
far
removed
from
the
twelfth
century
this
figure
of
a
man
will
follow
us
and
help
to
animate
any
wild
scene
that
is
coloured
by
antiquity
it
is
some
such
man
his
fair
hair
perhaps
exchanged
for
black
and
his
nobility
more
animal
and
clothed
in
skins
that
we
see
if
we
see
a
man
at
all
when
we
muse
deeply
upon
the
old
road
worn
deep
into
the
chalk
among
burial
mound
and
encampment
we
feel
rather
than
see
the
innumerable
companies
of
men
like
this
following
their
small
cattle
to
the
stream
or
the
wearing
out
the
hard
earth
with
their
naked
feet
and
trailing
ash
staves
going
up
such
a
road
between
steep
banks
of
chalk
and
the
roots
and
projecting
bases
of
beeches
whose
foliage
meets
overhead
a
road
worn
twenty
feet
deep
and
now
scarce
ever
used
as
a
footpath
except
by
fox
and
hare
we
may
be
that
we
have
climbed
that
way
before
during
the
furrowing
of
the
road
and
we
move
as
in
a
dream
between
this
age
and
that
dim
one
which
we
vainly
strive
to
recover
but
because
we
are
imperfectly
versed
in
history
we
are
not
therefore
blind
to
the
past
the
eye
that
sees
the
things
of
and
the
ear
that
hears
the
mind
that
contemplates
or
dreams
is
itself
an
instrument
of
an
antiquity
equal
to
whatever
it
is
called
upon
to
apprehend
we
are
not
merely
londoners
or
kentish
men
or
welshmen
we
belong
to
the
days
of
wordsworth
of
elizabeth
of
richard
plantagenet
of
harold
of
the
earliest
bards
we
too
like
taliesin
have
borne
a
banner
before
alexander
have
been
with
our
lord
in
the
manger
of
the
ass
have
been
in
india
and
with
the
of
troia
and
with
noah
in
the
ark
and
our
original
country
is
region
of
the
summer
and
of
these
many
folds
in
our
nature
the
face
of
the
earth
reminds
us
and
perhaps
even
where
there
are
no
more
marks
visible
upon
the
land
than
there
were
in
eden
we
are
aware
of
the
passing
of
time
in
ways
too
difficult
and
strange
for
the
explanation
of
historian
and
zoologist
and
philosopher
it
is
this
manifold
nature
that
responds
with
such
indescribable
depth
and
variety
to
the
appeals
of
many
landscapes
we
come
to
a
huge
grassy
coombe
smooth
as
a
racecourse
that
winds
out
of
the
cornland
into
the
heart
of
the
downs
it
is
like
the
bed
of
a
river
of
great
depth
at
its
entrance
beeches
clothe
either
side
but
presently
they
cease
and
up
the
steep
juniper
slopes
go
the
paths
of
hares
of
the
herds
and
flocks
of
earliest
ages
and
of
the
men
and
women
and
children
also
whose
children
have
forgotten
them
though
not
perhaps
their
philosophy
the
grass
of
the
slope
is
mingled
with
small
sweet
herbage
the
salad
burnet
the
orange
trefoil
the
purple
thyme
the
fine
white
flax
the
delicatest
golden
and
basil
and
marjoram
and
rosettes
of
crimson
thistles
all
sunny
warm
and
fragrant
glittering
and
glowing
or
melting
into
a
simmering
haze
musical
with
grasshoppers
and
with
blue
butterflies
so
that
the
earth
seems
to
be
a
genial
animal
at
length
the
windings
shut
out
the
plain
and
the
coombe
is
a
green
hall
roofed
by
the
hot
blue
sky
its
walls
are
steeper
than
ever
and
the
burrowings
of
the
rabbits
have
streaked
the
grasses
with
long
splashes
like
those
made
by
on
rocks
of
white
chalk
the
curves
of
these
walls
are
like
those
of
the
flight
of
the
swifts
that
dive
overhead
here
there
are
no
human
paths
no
sign
of
house
of
grave
of
herd
of
cultivation
it
is
the
end
and
the
rabbits
race
up
and
down
as
in
a
dream
of
solitude
yet
the
mind
is
not
discontented
and
unfed
this
is
no
boundless
solitude
of
ocean
where
one
may
take
a
kind
of
pleasure
to
float
for
ever
with
a
careless
course
and
think
himself
the
only
being
alive
it
is
not
an
end
but
a
beginning
that
we
have
reached
these
are
the
elements
pure
earth
and
wind
and
sunlight
out
of
which
beauty
and
joy
arise
original
and
ancient
for
ever
young
their
presence
restores
us
not
to
the
middle
ages
not
to
the
days
of
heroic
princes
and
princesses
of
britain
not
to
any
dim
world
of
reeking
marsh
and
wood
of
mammoth
and
brutish
men
but
to
a
region
out
of
space
and
out
of
time
in
which
life
and
thought
and
physical
health
are
in
harmony
with
sun
and
earth
fragrant
as
the
flowers
in
the
grass
blithe
as
the
grasshopper
swift
as
the
hares
divine
and
out
of
it
all
arises
a
vision
of
the
man
who
will
embody
this
thought
a
man
whom
human
infelicity
discontented
with
the
past
has
placed
in
a
golden
age
still
farther
back
for
the
sufficient
reason
that
in
every
age
he
has
been
a
dream
and
our
dreaming
is
of
the
dawn
or
the
night
always
disappointed
but
undaunted
by
the
day
that
follows
and
so
no
storied
valley
or
hillside
is
richer
in
humanity
than
this
coombe
it
is
one
of
the
countless
edens
where
we
are
in
contact
not
with
the
soldier
and
ploughman
and
mason
that
change
the
surface
of
the
earth
but
with
prophet
and
poet
who
have
ever
lived
to
trace
to
nature
and
to
the
early
ages
the
health
and
vigour
of
men
there
is
the
greatest
antiquity
of
all
peace
and
purity
and
simplicity
and
in
the
midst
is
the
mother
earth
the
young
mother
of
the
world
with
a
face
like
ceres
before
she
had
lost
persephone
in
the
underworld
in
fact
so
blessed
is
this
solitary
hall
that
after
climbing
out
it
is
mournful
to
see
the
tunnels
and
the
roman
camp
on
the
ridge
dawn
in
by
charles
doughty
cornwall
in
cornwall
where
the
wrinkles
and
angles
of
the
age
are
left
to
show
antiquity
plays
a
part
on
every
hand
what
a
curious
effect
have
those
ruins
all
but
invisible
among
the
sands
the
scabious
the
tamarisk
and
rush
though
at
night
they
seem
not
inaudible
when
the
wild
air
is
full
of
crying
some
that
are
not
nearly
as
old
are
almost
as
magical
one
there
is
that
stands
near
a
great
water
cut
off
from
a
little
town
and
from
the
world
by
a
round
green
hill
and
touched
by
no
road
but
only
by
a
wandering
path
at
the
foot
of
this
hill
among
yellow
mounds
of
sand
under
blue
sky
the
church
is
dark
and
alone
it
is
not
very
old
not
five
centuries
and
is
of
plainest
masonry
its
blunt
short
spire
of
slate
slabs
that
leans
slightly
to
one
side
with
the
smallest
of
perforated
slate
windows
at
the
base
has
a
look
of
age
and
rusticity
in
the
churchyard
is
a
rough
grey
cross
of
stone
a
disc
supported
by
a
pillar
it
is
surrounded
by
the
waving
noiseless
tamarisk
it
looks
northward
over
the
sandhills
at
a
blue
bay
guarded
on
the
west
by
tall
grey
cliffs
which
a
white
column
surmounts
for
a
time
the
nearer
sandhills
have
rested
and
clothed
themselves
in
trefoil
thyme
eyebright
and
short
turf
but
once
the
church
was
buried
beneath
them
between
the
round
hill
and
the
church
a
tiny
stream
sidles
along
through
a
level
of
flags
and
yellow
flag
flowers
of
purple
figwort
and
purple
orchis
and
green
grass
a
cormorant
flies
low
across
the
sky
that
sable
bird
which
seems
to
belong
to
the
old
time
the
time
of
badger
and
beaver
of
ancient
men
who
rose
up
out
of
the
crags
of
this
coast
to
them
when
the
cuckoo
first
called
one
april
came
over
the
blue
sea
a
small
brown
ship
followed
by
three
seals
and
out
of
it
descended
a
christian
from
ireland
with
ready
red
lips
and
deep
sweet
voice
and
spoke
to
them
all
alone
he
told
them
of
a
power
that
ruled
the
blue
waters
and
shifting
sands
who
could
move
the
round
green
hill
to
the
rock
of
the
white
gulls
taller
and
grimmer
than
the
cloven
headland
yet
sweet
and
gentle
as
the
fennel
above
as
the
atlantic
storm
tender
also
as
the
sedgewarbler
in
the
flags
below
the
hill
whose
palace
was
loftier
than
the
blue
to
which
the
lark
was
now
soaring
milder
and
richer
than
the
meadows
in
may
and
everlasting
and
his
attendants
were
more
numerous
and
bright
than
the
herring
under
a
moon
of
frost
the
milkpails
should
be
fuller
and
the
grass
deeper
and
the
corn
heavier
in
the
car
if
they
believed
in
this
the
pilchards
should
be
as
water
boiling
in
the
bay
and
they
should
have
wings
as
of
the
white
birds
that
lounged
about
the
precipices
of
the
coast
and
all
the
time
the
three
seals
lay
with
their
heads
and
backs
above
the
shallows
and
watched
perhaps
the
men
believed
his
word
perhaps
they
dropped
him
over
the
precipice
to
see
whether
he
also
flew
like
a
gull
but
here
is
the
church
named
after
him
all
along
the
coast
and
especially
where
it
is
lofty
and
houseless
and
on
the
ledges
of
the
crags
the
young
grey
gulls
unable
to
fly
bob
their
heads
seaward
and
try
to
scream
like
their
parents
who
wheel
far
and
near
with
double
yodeling
cry
there
are
many
rounded
barrows
looking
out
to
sea
and
there
are
some
amidst
the
sandhills
bare
and
corrugated
by
the
wind
and
heaved
up
like
a
their
edges
golden
against
the
blue
sky
or
mangily
covered
by
drab
marram
grass
that
whistles
wintrily
and
near
by
the
blue
sea
slightly
roughened
as
by
a
barrow
sleeps
calm
but
foamy
among
isles
donkeys
graze
on
the
brown
turf
larks
rise
and
fall
and
curlews
go
by
a
cuckoo
sings
among
the
deserted
mines
but
the
barrows
are
most
noble
on
the
high
heather
and
grass
the
lonely
turf
is
full
of
lilac
scabious
flowers
and
crimson
knapweed
among
the
solid
mounds
of
gorse
the
of
the
dry
summer
grass
reveals
myriads
of
the
flowers
of
thyme
of
stonecrop
yellow
and
white
of
pearly
eyebright
of
golden
fingers
and
the
white
or
grey
clover
with
its
purest
and
earthiest
of
all
fragrances
here
and
there
steep
tracks
descend
slantwise
among
the
crags
to
the
sea
or
promise
to
descend
but
end
abruptly
in
precipices
on
the
barrows
themselves
which
are
either
isolated
or
in
a
group
of
two
or
three
grow
thistle
and
gorse
they
command
mile
upon
mile
of
cliff
and
sea
in
their
sight
the
great
headlands
run
out
to
sea
and
sinking
seem
to
rise
again
a
few
miles
out
in
a
sheer
island
so
that
they
resemble
couchant
beasts
with
backs
under
water
but
heads
and
haunches
upreared
the
cliffs
are
cleft
many
times
by
coves
some
with
broad
sand
and
shallow
water
among
purple
rocks
the
outlet
of
a
rivulet
others
ending
precipitously
so
that
the
stream
suddenly
plunges
into
the
black
sea
among
a
huddle
of
sunless
boulders
near
such
a
stream
there
will
be
a
grey
farm
amid
grey
outbuildings
with
a
carved
wooden
eagle
from
the
wreckage
of
the
cove
or
a
mermaid
once
a
with
fair
long
hair
and
round
bosom
built
into
the
wall
of
a
barn
or
there
is
a
briny
hamlet
grouped
steeply
on
either
side
of
the
stream
which
gurgles
among
the
pebbles
down
to
the
feet
of
the
bearded
fisherman
and
the
ships
or
perhaps
there
is
no
stream
at
all
and
bramble
and
gorse
come
down
dry
and
hot
to
the
lips
of
the
emerald
and
purple
pools
deep
roads
from
the
sea
to
the
have
been
worn
by
smuggler
and
fisherman
and
miner
climbing
and
descending
inland
shows
a
solitary
pinnacled
church
tower
rosy
in
the
warm
evening
a
thin
line
of
trees
long
bare
stems
and
dark
foliage
matted
and
farther
still
the
ridges
of
misty
granite
rough
as
the
back
of
a
perch
of
all
the
rocky
land
of
the
sapphire
sea
white
with
quiet
foam
the
barrows
are
masters
the
breaking
away
of
the
rock
has
brought
them
nearer
to
the
sea
as
it
has
annihilated
some
and
cut
off
the
in
they
stand
in
the
unenclosed
waste
and
are
removed
from
all
human
uses
and
from
most
wayfaring
thus
they
share
the
sublimity
of
beacons
and
are
about
to
show
that
tombs
also
have
their
deaths
linnet
and
stonechat
and
pipit
seem
to
attend
upon
them
with
pretty
voices
and
motions
and
a
certain
ghastliness
as
of
shadows
given
to
their
cheerful
and
sudden
flittings
by
the
solemn
neighbourhood
but
most
of
their
hold
upon
the
spirit
they
owe
to
their
powerful
suggestion
that
here
upon
the
high
sea
border
was
once
lived
a
bold
proud
life
like
that
of
beowulf
whose
words
when
he
was
dying
from
the
wounds
of
his
last
victory
were
the
warriors
raise
a
funeral
mound
to
flash
with
fire
on
a
promontory
above
the
sea
that
it
may
stand
high
and
be
a
memorial
by
which
my
people
shall
remember
me
and
seafarers
driving
their
tall
ships
through
the
mist
of
the
sea
shall
say
in
cornwall
as
in
wales
these
monuments
are
the
more
impressive
because
the
earth
wasting
with
them
and
showing
her
bones
takes
their
part
there
are
days
when
the
age
of
the
downs
strewn
with
tumuli
and
the
remnants
of
camp
and
village
is
incredible
or
rather
they
seem
in
the
course
of
long
time
to
have
grown
smooth
and
soft
and
kind
and
to
be
like
a
rounded
languid
cloud
an
expression
of
summer
bliss
of
afternoon
but
granite
and
slate
and
sandstone
jut
out
and
in
whatsoever
weather
speak
rather
of
the
cold
drear
hard
windy
dawn
nothing
can
soften
the
lines
of
trendreen
or
brown
willy
or
carn
galver
against
the
sky
the
small
ploughlands
amidst
brake
and
gorse
do
but
accentuate
the
wildness
of
the
land
from
which
they
have
been
won
the
deserted
mines
are
frozen
cries
of
despair
as
if
they
had
perished
in
conflict
with
the
waste
and
in
a
few
years
their
chimneys
standing
amidst
rotted
woodwork
the
falling
masonry
the
engine
rusty
huge
and
still
the
abode
of
rabbits
and
all
overgrown
with
bedstraw
the
stern
thistle
and
wizard
henbane
are
in
keeping
with
the
miles
of
barren
land
littered
with
rough
silvered
stones
among
heather
and
furze
whose
many
barrows
are
deep
in
fern
and
bramble
and
foxglove
the
cotton
grass
raises
its
pure
nodding
white
the
old
roads
dive
among
still
more
furze
and
bracken
and
bramble
and
foxglove
and
on
every
side
the
land
grows
no
such
crop
as
that
of
grey
stones
even
in
the
midst
of
occasional
cornfield
or
weedless
pasture
a
long
grey
upright
stone
speaks
of
the
past
in
many
places
men
have
set
up
these
stones
roughly
squaring
some
of
them
in
the
form
of
a
circle
or
in
groups
of
circles
and
over
them
beats
the
buzzard
in
slow
hesitating
and
swerving
flight
in
one
place
the
work
of
nature
might
be
mistaken
for
that
of
man
on
a
natural
hillock
stands
what
appears
to
be
the
ruin
of
an
irregularly
heaped
wall
of
grey
rock
roughened
by
lichen
built
of
enormous
angular
fragments
like
the
masonry
of
a
child
near
at
hand
bracken
pink
stonecrop
heather
and
bright
gold
tormentil
soften
it
but
at
a
distance
it
stands
black
against
the
summer
sky
touched
with
the
pathos
of
handiwork
overthrown
yet
certainly
an
accident
of
nature
it
commands
cape
cornwall
and
the
harsh
sea
and
just
with
its
horned
church
tower
on
every
hand
lie
cromlech
camp
circle
hut
and
tumulus
of
the
unwritten
years
they
are
confused
and
mingled
with
the
natural
litter
of
a
barren
land
it
is
a
silent
bedlam
of
history
a
senseless
cemetery
or
museum
amidst
which
we
walk
as
animals
must
do
when
they
see
those
valleys
full
of
skeletons
where
their
kind
are
said
to
go
punctually
to
die
there
are
enough
of
the
dead
they
outnumber
the
living
and
there
those
trite
truths
burst
with
life
and
drum
upon
the
tympanum
with
ambiguous
fatal
voices
at
the
end
of
this
moor
yet
not
in
it
there
is
a
solitary
circle
of
grey
stones
where
the
cry
of
the
past
is
less
vociferous
less
bewildering
than
on
the
moor
itself
but
more
intense
nineteen
tall
grey
stones
stand
round
a
taller
pointed
one
that
is
heavily
bowed
amidst
long
grass
and
bracken
and
furze
a
track
passes
close
by
but
does
not
enter
the
circle
the
grass
is
unbent
except
by
the
weight
of
its
bloom
it
bears
a
name
that
connects
it
with
the
assembling
and
rivalry
of
the
bards
of
britain
here
under
the
sky
they
met
leaning
upon
the
stones
tall
fair
men
of
peace
but
whose
songs
could
change
ploughshare
into
sword
here
they
met
and
the
growth
of
the
grass
the
perfection
of
the
stones
except
that
one
stoops
as
with
age
and
the
silence
suggest
that
since
the
last
bard
left
it
in
robe
of
blue
or
white
or
green
the
colours
of
sky
and
cloud
and
grass
upon
this
fair
day
the
circle
has
been
unmolested
and
the
law
obeyed
which
forbade
any
but
a
bard
to
enter
it
was
the
colour
of
a
chief
robe
emblematic
of
peace
and
heavenly
calm
and
of
unchangeableness
white
the
colour
of
the
dress
was
the
emblem
of
light
and
of
its
correlatives
purity
of
conduct
wisdom
and
piety
green
was
the
colour
of
the
youthful
robe
for
it
was
the
emblem
of
growth
their
uniformity
of
colour
signified
perfect
truth
and
the
inscription
upon
the
chair
of
the
bards
of
beisgawen
was
is
that
is
not
for
ever
and
blue
and
white
and
green
peace
and
light
and
growth
is
that
is
not
for
ever
and
these
things
and
the
blue
sky
the
white
cloudy
hall
of
the
sun
and
the
green
bough
and
grass
hallowed
the
ancient
stones
and
clearer
than
any
vision
of
tall
bards
in
the
morning
of
the
world
was
the
tranquil
delight
of
being
thus
out
of
in
the
presence
of
this
ancientness
it
is
strange
to
pass
from
these
monumental
moors
straight
to
the
sea
which
records
the
moments
not
the
years
or
the
centuries
in
fine
weather
especially
its
colour
when
for
example
it
is
faintly
corrugated
and
of
a
blue
that
melts
towards
the
horizon
into
such
a
hue
that
it
is
indistinguishable
from
the
violet
wall
of
dawn
is
a
perpetual
astonishment
on
account
of
its
unearthliness
and
evanescence
the
mind
does
not
at
once
accept
the
fact
that
here
underneath
our
eyes
is
as
it
were
another
sky
the
physical
act
of
looking
up
induces
a
special
mood
of
solemnity
and
veneration
and
during
the
act
the
eyes
meet
with
a
fitting
object
in
the
stainless
heavens
looking
down
we
are
used
to
seeing
the
earth
the
road
the
footpath
the
floor
the
hearth
but
when
instead
it
is
the
sea
and
not
any
of
these
things
although
our
feet
are
on
firm
land
the
solemnity
is
of
another
kind
in
its
anger
the
sea
becomes
humanized
or
animalized
we
see
resemblances
to
familiar
things
there
is
for
instance
an
hour
sometimes
after
sunset
when
the
grey
sky
coldly
lights
the
lines
of
white
plumes
on
a
steely
sea
and
they
have
an
inevitable
likeness
to
a
trampling
chivalry
that
charges
upon
a
foe
but
a
calm
sea
is
incomparable
except
to
moods
of
the
mind
it
is
then
as
remote
from
the
earth
and
earthly
things
as
the
sky
and
the
remoteness
is
the
more
astonishing
because
it
is
almost
within
our
grasp
it
is
no
wonder
that
a
great
idea
was
expressed
by
the
fortunate
islands
in
the
sea
the
youthfulness
the
incorruptibility
of
the
sea
continually
renewing
itself
the
same
from
generation
to
generation
prepares
it
as
a
fit
sanctuary
of
the
immortal
dead
so
at
least
we
are
apt
to
think
at
certain
times
coming
from
the
heavy
scarred
tormented
earth
to
that
immense
aëry
plain
of
peacock
blue
and
yet
at
other
times
that
same
unearthliness
will
suggest
quite
other
thoughts
it
has
not
changed
and
shrunken
and
grown
like
the
earth
it
is
not
it
is
a
monster
that
has
lain
unmoved
by
time
sleeping
and
moaning
outside
the
gates
within
which
men
and
animals
have
become
what
they
are
actually
that
cold
fatal
element
and
its
myriad
population
without
a
sound
brings
a
wistfulness
into
the
mind
as
if
it
could
feel
back
and
dimly
recall
the
dawn
of
time
when
the
sea
was
incomprehensible
and
impassable
when
the
earth
had
but
lately
risen
out
of
the
waters
and
was
yet
again
to
descend
beneath
it
becomes
a
type
of
the
waste
where
everything
is
unknown
or
uncertain
except
death
pouring
into
the
brain
the
thoughts
that
men
have
had
on
looking
out
over
untrodden
mountain
forest
swamp
in
the
drizzling
dawn
of
the
world
the
sea
is
exactly
what
it
was
when
mountain
forest
swamp
were
imperturbable
enemies
and
the
sight
of
it
restores
the
ancient
fear
i
remember
one
dawn
above
all
others
when
this
restoration
was
complete
when
it
was
yet
dark
the
wind
rose
gustily
under
a
low
grey
sky
and
a
lark
sang
amidst
the
moan
of
gorse
and
the
creak
of
gates
and
the
breath
of
the
tide
at
the
full
nor
was
it
yet
light
when
the
gulls
began
to
wheel
and
wind
and
float
with
a
motion
like
foam
on
a
whirlpool
or
interwoven
snow
they
wheeled
about
the
masts
of
that
nodded
and
kissed
and
crossed
in
a
steep
cove
of
crags
whose
black
edges
were
slavered
by
the
foam
of
the
dark
sea
and
there
were
no
men
among
the
boats
or
about
the
grey
houses
that
looked
past
the
walls
of
the
cove
to
the
grim
staircase
and
of
a
black
headland
whose
perpendicular
rocks
stood
up
far
out
of
the
reach
of
the
wings
fashioned
in
the
likeness
of
gigantic
idols
the
higher
crags
were
bushy
and
scaly
with
lichen
and
they
were
cushioned
upon
thrift
and
trefoil
and
white
bladder
campion
it
was
a
bristling
sea
not
in
the
least
stormy
but
bristling
dark
and
cold
through
the
slow
colourless
dawn
dark
and
cold
and
immense
and
at
the
edge
of
it
the
earth
knelt
offering
up
the
music
of
a
small
flitting
bird
and
the
beauty
of
small
flowers
white
and
gold
to
those
idols
they
were
terrible
enough
but
the
sea
was
more
terrible
for
it
was
the
god
of
whom
those
rocks
were
the
poor
childish
images
and
it
seemed
that
the
god
had
just
then
disclosed
his
true
nature
and
hence
the
pitiful
loveliness
of
the
flowers
the
pitiful
sweetness
of
the
bird
that
sang
among
the
rocks
at
the
margin
of
the
kind
earth
now
and
then
the
sea
will
startle
by
some
resemblance
to
the
earth
thus
i
have
come
unexpectedly
in
sight
of
it
on
a
strange
coast
and
have
not
known
that
it
was
the
sea
a
gale
from
the
was
blowing
and
it
was
late
afternoon
in
the
land
was
sandy
moorland
treeless
and
dark
with
heather
a
mile
away
i
saw
rising
up
into
the
sky
what
seemed
a
peaty
mountain
in
cardiganshire
as
it
would
be
in
a
tempest
of
rain
and
it
was
only
when
i
was
near
the
cliff
and
could
see
the
three
long
walls
of
white
waves
towards
the
shore
that
i
knew
it
was
the
sea
more
common
is
the
calm
sea
in
over
which
go
bands
of
lighter
hue
like
pale
moorland
paths
winding
about
a
moor
in
a
stern
land
like
cornwall
that
so
often
refuses
the
consolations
of
grass
and
herb
and
tree
the
relentings
are
the
more
gracious
these
are
to
be
found
in
a
whole
valley
where
there
are
sloping
fields
of
corn
and
grass
divided
by
green
hedges
and
woods
rich
and
misty
and
warm
and
the
bones
of
the
land
are
buried
away
until
it
ends
in
a
bay
where
high
and
cavernous
dark
rocks
stand
on
either
side
of
blue
water
and
level
sand
often
all
the
sweetness
of
the
country
round
seems
to
have
run
into
one
great
roadside
hedge
as
dewdrops
collect
in
the
bosom
of
a
leaf
the
stones
of
the
original
wall
are
themselves
deeply
hidden
in
turf
or
from
the
crevices
ferns
descend
and
the
pale
blooms
of
pennywort
rise
up
the
lichen
is
furry
and
the
yellow
or
pink
stonecrop
is
neat
and
dense
ivy
climbs
closely
up
and
hangs
down
in
loose
array
up
from
the
top
of
the
wall
or
mound
rise
bramble
and
gorse
and
woodbine
over
them
or
brier
and
thorn
and
woodbine
again
and
the
tallest
and
massiest
of
foxgloves
cleave
through
these
with
their
bells
half
a
hundred
of
them
in
rows
five
deep
already
open
and
as
many
more
yet
in
bud
dense
as
grapes
dewy
murmurous
and
below
the
foxgloves
are
slender
parsleys
rough
wood
sage
and
poppies
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
between
it
and
the
road
is
a
grassy
strip
where
the
yarrow
grows
feathery
with
gilded
cinquefoil
and
tormentil
or
above
nettles
as
dense
as
corn
rise
large
discs
of
white
hog
parsnip
flower
a
coarse
and
often
dirty
flower
that
has
a
dry
smell
of
summer
or
bramble
and
brier
arch
this
way
and
that
their
green
and
rosy
and
purple
stems
bright
leaves
flowers
pink
and
white
only
the
cornish
stiles
of
stone
interrupting
the
hedge
and
giving
a
view
of
barren
hills
or
sea
destroy
the
illusion
created
by
this
exuberance
of
herb
and
bush
and
the
perfume
of
woodbine
and
rose
nowhere
is
the
stateliness
or
grace
or
privacy
of
trees
more
conspicuous
than
about
the
cornish
towns
and
farms
the
tall
elms
above
padstow
for
example
would
be
natural
and
acceptable
unconsciously
elsewhere
but
above
those
crossing
lines
of
roof
they
have
an
indescribable
benevolence
the
farmhouses
are
usually
square
dry
and
grey
being
built
of
slate
with
roofs
painted
by
lichen
some
are
whitewashed
in
some
indeed
the
stones
are
of
many
greys
and
blues
with
yellowish
and
reddish
tinges
hard
but
warm
in
the
sun
and
comforting
to
look
at
when
close
to
the
sea
and
some
ruinous
promontory
few
are
screened
by
ivy
or
climbing
rose
the
farm
buildings
are
of
the
same
kind
relieved
by
yellow
straw
the
many
hues
of
hay
the
purple
bracken
stacks
the
dark
peat
the
gates
are
coarse
and
mean
of
iron
or
of
cheap
or
rough
wood
lightly
made
patched
held
together
by
string
and
owing
their
only
charm
to
the
chance
use
of
the
curved
ribs
of
ships
as
but
to
many
of
the
buildings
sycamore
and
ash
and
apple
trees
bent
above
tall
grass
lend
their
beauty
of
line
of
mass
of
colour
of
shade
of
sound
and
of
many
motions
i
can
never
forget
the
rows
of
ash
trees
the
breezy
sycamores
and
the
tamarisks
by
ancient
harlyn
with
its
barrows
on
the
hill
its
ruins
of
chapel
and
church
among
rushes
and
poppies
its
little
oak
wood
by
the
sandy
river
mouth
where
the
men
of
old
time
buried
their
dead
the
poppied
corn
the
white
gulls
and
their
black
shadows
wheeling
over
sunny
turf
the
file
of
lean
woods
seen
between
perranporth
and

inland
the
sycamores
above
the
farm
near

the
road
dips
and
the
deep
furrow
of
a
little
valley
winds
with
hay
upon
its
slopes
out
to

the
green
wood
long
and
beautiful
below
the
gentle
brown
slopes
of

down
the
several
companies
of

when
they
begin
to
move
after
some
tense
episode
the
sycamore

round
the
tower
of
gwithian
church
and
in
amongst
the
few
thatched
cottages
alongside
the
yellow
towans
and
violet
sea
in
a
land
of
deserted
roofless
houses
with
solid
chimneys
that
no
man
wants
the
narrow
copse
of
small
spindly
oaks
upholding
with
bare
crooked
stems
as
of
stone
a
screen
of
leaves
above
a
brooklet
that
runs
to
the
sea
through
dense

and

where

the
wet

in
a
narrow
valley
where
red
campion
and
bracken
and
bramble
are
unpenetrated
among
flowery

thorns
and
sycamores
a
farm
that
has
a

gloomy
and
crystal
under
sycamore
and
ash
the
thin
halting
procession
of
almost
branchless
trees
on
the
ridge
of
the
beacon
above
sancreed
a
procession
that
seems
even
at
to
move
in
another
world
in
the
world
and
in
the
age
of
the
stone
circles
and
cairns
and
cromlechs
of
the
moor
beyond
the
sycamore
and
elder
that
surround
and
tower
above
tregonebris
near
boscawen
un
the
avenue
of
ash
and
elm
and
and
sycamore
very
close
together
leading
from
grey
nancothan
mill
where
the
water
mingles
its
noise
with
the
rustling
trees
the
and
sycamores
about
the
roads
near
hilary
and
the
long
avenue
of
ash
up
to
the
church
itself
and
the
elms
through
which
the
evening
music
floats
amidst
the
smell
of
hay
in
a
misty
mountained
sunset
under
the
flaming
fleeces
of
a
precipitous
sky
in
a
windless
hush
and
at
low
tide
i
descended
to
a
narrow
distinct
valley
just
where
a
stream
ran
clear
and
slow
through
level
sands
to
a
bay
between
headlands
of
rocks
and
of
caves
among
the
rocks
the
sides
of
the
valley
near
the
sea
were
high
and
steep
and
of
grass
until
their
abrupt
end
in
a
low
but
perpendicular
wall
of
rock
just
above
the
river
sands
inland
the
valley
began
to
wind
and
at
the
bend
trees
came
darkly
trooping
down
the
slopes
to
the
water
immediately
opposite
the
ford
the
wet
sands
being
unscathed
by
any
foot
or
hoof
or
wheel
a
tributary
ran
into
the
river
through
a
gorge
of
its
own
it
was
a
gorge
not
above
a
hundred
feet
across
and
its
floor
was
of
sand
save
where
the
brook
was
running
down
and
this
floor
was
all
in
shadow
because
the
banks
were
clothed
in
thick
underwood
and
in
ash
sycamore
and
oak
meeting
overhead
and
in
these
sands
also
there
was
no
footprint
save
of
the
retreated
sea
there
was
no
house
nor
wall
nor
road
and
there
was
no
sound
in
the
caverns
of
foliage
except
one
call
of
a
cuckoo
as
i
entered
and
the
warbling
of
a
blackbird
that
mused
in
the
oaks
and
then
laughed
and
was
silent
and
mused
again
and
filled
the
mind
with
the
fairest
images
of
solitude
solitude
where
a
maid
thinking
of
naught
unthought
of
unseen
combs
out
her
yellow
hair
and
lets
her
spirit
slip
down
into
the
tresses
where
a
man
fearful
of
his
kind
ascends
out
of
the
deeps
of
himself
so
that
his
eyes
look
bravely
and
his
face
unstiffens
and
unwrinkles
and
his
motion
and
gesture
is
fast
and
free
where
a
child
walks
and
stops
and
runs
and
sings
in
careless
joy
that
takes
him
winding
far
out
into
abysses
of
eternity
and
makes
him
free
of
them
so
that
years
afterward
the
hour
and
place
and
sky
return
and
the
eternity
on
which
they
opened
as
a
casement
but
not
the
child
not
the
joy
i
like
trees
for
the
cool
evening
voices
of
their
many
leaves
for
their
cloudy
forms
linked
to
earth
by
stately
stems
for
the
pale
lifting
of
the
sycamore
leaves
in
breezes
and
also
their
drooping
hushed
and
massed
repose
for
the
myriad
division
of
the
light
ash
leaves
for
their
straight
pillars
and
for
the
twisted
branch
work
for
their
still
shade
and
their
rippling
or
calm
shimmering
or
dimly
glowing
light
for
the
quicksilver
drip
of
dawn
for
their
solemnity
and
their
dancing
for
all
their
sounds
and
motions
their
sighs
their
nocturnal
murmurs
their
fitful
fingerings
at
thunder
time
their
swishing
and
tossing
and
hissing
in
violent
rain
the
roar
of
their
congregations
before
the
wind
when
it
seems
that
they
must
lift
up
the
land
and
fly
away
with
it
for
their
rustlings
of
welcome
in
harvest
heat
for
their
kindliness
and
their
serene
remoteness
and
inhumanity
and
especially
the
massiest
of
the
trees
that
have
also
the
glory
of
motion
the
sycamores
which
are
the
chief
tree
of
cornwall
as
the
beeches
and
yews
are
of
the
downs
the
oaks
of
the
weald
the
elms
of
the
wiltshire
vales
before
i
part
from
trees
i
should
like
to
mention
those
of
and
above
all
the
elms
i
am
thinking
of
them
as
they
are
at
noon
on
the
hottest
days
of
haymaking
at
the
end
of
june
the
sky
is
hot
its
pale
blue
without
pity
and
changing
to
a
yellow
of
mist
near
the
horizon
the
land
is
level
and
all
of
grass
and
where
the
hay
is
not
spread
in
swathes
the
grass
is
almost
invisible
for
the
daisies
on
its
motionless
surface
here
and
there
the
mower
whirrs
and
seems
natural
music
like
the
of
the
burning
earth
through
the
levels
wind
the
grey
willows
of
a
hidden
stream
in
the
hedges
and
in
the
wide
fields
and
about
the
still
silent
farmhouses
of
stone
there
are
many
elms
they
are
tall
and
slender
despite
their
full
mounded
summits
they
cast
no
shade
in
the
great
heat
their
green
is
all
but
grey
and
their
leaves
are
lost
in
the
mist
which
their
mingling
creates
they
seem
to
be
stealing
away
over
the
fields
to
the
sanctuary
of
the
hills
low
and
round
and
lapped
entirely
in
leaves
which
stand
in
the
mist
at
the
edge
of
the
plain
to
be
leaving
that
plain
to
the
possession
of
the
whirring
mower
and
the
sun
of
almighty
summer
sycamores
solemnized
the
cornish
farm
in
the
twilight
where
i
asked
the
wife
if
she
could
let
us
have
two
beds
for
the
night
she
stood
in
the
doorway
hands
on
hips
watching
her
last
excited
minutes
of
play
in
the
rickyard
the
master
she
replied
pointing
to
the
farmer
who
was
talking
to
his
carter
between
the
rickyard
and
the
door
under
the
sycamores
beds
is
what
we
should
like
said
my
friend
and
i
do
you
want
with
two
beds
he
asked
with
a
tinge
of
scorn
as
well
as
of
pity
in
his
frank
amusement
missus
and
i
have
only
had
one
bed
these
forty
here
he
laughed
so
gaily
that
he
could
not
have
embarrassed
the
very
devil
of
puritanism
and
turning
to
his
man
he
called
forth
a
deep
bass
laughter
and
from
his
wife
a
peal
that
shook
her
arms
so
that
she
raised
them
to
the
sides
of
the
porch
for
better
support
the
children
also
turned
their
laughter
our
way
perhaps
one
of
you
kicks
in
his
sleep
we
come
inside
i
dare
say
you
are
tired
john
now
children
up
with
i
think
they
were
the
most
excellent
pair
of
man
and
woman
i
ever
saw
both
were
of
a
splendid
physical
type
she
the
more
energetic
plump
and
tall
and
straight
he
the
more
enduring
and
bearded
hardly
her
equal
in
height
certainly
not
in
words
in
forty
years
neither
had
overpowered
the
other
they
had
not
even
agreed
to
take
separate
paths
but
like
two
new
friends
they
could
afford
to
contend
together
in
opinions
without
fear
of
damage
or
of
lazy
truce
he
had
ploughed
and
sowed
and
reaped
she
had
borne
him
seven
children
had
baked
and
churned
and
stitched
they
had
loved
sweet
things
together
and
with
curses
at
times
their
children
and
the
land
physical
strength
and
purity
that
were
in
them
the
whole
of
morality
seemed
to
have
given
them
that
equality
with
the
conditions
of
life
which
philosophy
has
done
nothing
but
talk
about
they
of
all
men
and
women
had
perhaps
jarred
least
upon
the
music
of
the
spheres
they
had
the
right
and
power
to
live
and
the
end
was
laughter
in
all
those
years
they
had
been
separated
but
once
until
four
years
ago
she
had
not
been
out
of
cornwall
except
to
bury
her
mother
who
had
suddenly
died
in
london
two
hundred
pounds
fell
to
her
share
on
that
death
and
the
money
arrived
one
morning
after
the
harvest
thanksgiving
for
a
week
she
continued
to
go
about
her
work
in
the
old
way
save
that
she
sent
rather
hurriedly
for
a
daughter
who
had
just
left
her
place
as
cook
in
exeter
at
the
end
of
the
week
having
stored
the
apples
and
shown
her
daughter
how
to
use
the
separator
she
walked
in
to
penzance
in
her
best
clothes
but
without
even
a
handbag
her
husband
was
out
with
his
gun
by
the
next
day
she
was
at
liverpool
she
sent
off
a
picture
postcard
with
a
little
note
written
by
the
shopkeeper
saying
that
she
would
be
back
by
christmas
and
telling
her
husband
to
sell
the
old
bull
then
she
sailed
for
new
york
she
saw
niagara
she
visited
her
nephew
john
davy
at
cincinnati
she
spent
two
weeks
in
railway
travelling
west
and
south
and
saw
the
indians
four
days
before
christmas
she
was
back
in
the
rickyard
driving
before
her
a
young
bull
and
carrying
in
her
hand
a
bunch
of
maize
ann
back
before
your
time
said
her
husband
after
praising
the
beast
samuel
and
i
feel
as
if
i
could
whitewash
the
dairy
that
i
do
said
she
you
wait
till
proposed
sam
davy
think
i
will
for
i
can
hear
that
mary
is
behind
with
the
a
good
girl
but
she
got
your
patience
my
here
sam
the
change
she
said
giving
him
the
bunch
of
maize
in
cornwall
many
of
the
women
looked
less
english
than
the
men
the
noticeable
men
were
and
of
fair
complexion
and
rather
upright
and
of
good
bearing
the
noticeable
women
had
black
hair
pale
seldom
swarthy
faces
very
dark
eyes
perhaps
the
eyes
were
more
foreign
than
anything
else
in
them
they
were
singularly
immobile
and
seldom
changed
in
expression
with
their
voices
several
of
the
women
had
a
beauty
of
a
fearless
character
like
gypsy
women
in
their
movement
and
expression
but
the
wives
of
small
farmers
and
miners
on
piecework
look
old
very
soon
and
are
puckered
and
shadowy
in
the
face
some
of
these
and
old
women
suggested
an
early
and
barbarous
generation
the
eyes
were
small
and
and
the
face
narrowed
forward
like
an
which
gave
the
whole
a
peering
expression
of
suspicion
and
even
alarm
the
eyes
of
most
human
beings
are
causes
of
bewilderment
and
dismay
if
curiously
looked
at
but
the
strangest
i
ever
saw
were
in
an
old
cornish
woman
they
were
black
and
round
as
a
with
a
cold
brightness
that
made
them
seem
not
of
the
substance
of
other
eyes
but
like
a
stone
they
were
set
in
a
narrow
bony
face
of
parchment
among
grey
hair
crisp
and
disarrayed
i
saw
them
only
for
a
few
minutes
while
i
asked
a
few
questions
about
the
way
and
it
was
as
much
as
i
could
do
to
keep
up
the
conversation
so
much
did
those
motionless
eyes
invite
me
to
plunge
into
an
abyss
of
human
personality
such
intense
loneliness
and
strangeness
did
they
create
since
they
proclaimed
shrilly
and
clearly
that
beyond
a
desire
to
be
fed
and
clothed
we
had
nothing
in
common
had
they
peered
up
at
me
out
of
a
cromlech
or
hut
at
bosporthennis
i
could
not
have
been
more
puzzled
and
surprised
men
and
women
were
hospitable
and
ready
to
smile
as
the
welsh
are
and
they
have
an
alluring
naïveté
as
well
as
some
righteousness
one
family
was
excessively
virtuous
or
had
a
wish
to
appear
so
i
do
not
know
which
alternative
to
like
the
less
since
it
was
in
a
matter
of
game
they
rented
land
on
a
large
estate
and
had
a
right
to
the
rabbits
the
hares
were
sacred
to
the
great
landowner
the
wife
assured
me
that
one
of
her
sons
had
lately
brought
in
a
lame
hare
and
proposed
to
put
it
out
of
its
pain
but
that
she
had
said
take
it
out
and
let
it
die
outside
anywhere
the
best
thing
is
to
be
afraid
in
things
of
this
kind
and
then
you
go
doing
much
the
same
kind
or
quantity
of
manual
work
as
their
husbands
and
being
much
out
of
doors
the
manners
were
confident
and
free
their
speech
was
as
a
rule
fluent
and
grammatical
and
clearly
delivered
with
less
accent
than
in
any
part
of
england
coming
into
a
mining
village
one
day
and
wanting
tea
i
asked
a
woman
who
was
drawing
water
from
a
farmyard
well
if
she
could
make
me
some
thinking
she
was
the
wife
she
said
she
would
but
took
me
to
one
of
a
small
row
of
cottages
over
the
way
where
her
husband
was
in
the
midst
of
his
saturday
wash
taking
no
notice
of
him
she
led
me
into
the
and
with
a
huge
loaf
held
like
a
violin
began
buttering
and
cutting
thin
slices
while
she
talked
to
me
to
the
little
children
and
to
her
husband
from
the
adjacent
kitchen
she
was
tall
straight
as
a
pillar
with
clear
untanned
but
slightly
swarthy
skin
black
eyes
kindly
gleaming
cheeks
and
red
lips
smiling
above
her
broad
breast
and
hips
her
clothes
were
black
but
in
rags
that
hardly
clung
to
her
shoulders
and
waist
she
was
barely
five
and
twenty
but
had
six
young
children
about
her
one
in
a
cradle
by
the
hearth
and
another
still
crawling
at
her
feet
her
only
embarrassment
came
when
i
asked
to
pay
for
my
tea
she
began
adding
up
the
cost
a
pennyworth
of
bread
and
butter
a
halfpennyworth
of
tea
the
kitchen
consisted
simply
of
a
large
grate
and
baking
oven
plain
tables
and
chairs
on
a
flagged
floor
but
the
was
a
museum
with
photographs
of
a
volunteer
corps
of
friends
and
relations
on
the
wall
over
the
fire
foxgloves
in
surrounded
by
green
crinkled
paper
in
the
fireplace
on
the
mantelpiece
cheap
little
vases
and
scraps
of
ore
and
more
photographs
on
the
walls
were
three
pictures
one
of
two
children
being
timidly
inspected
by
fallow
deer
another
of
a
grandmother
showing
a
book
to
a
child
whose
attention
is
diverted
by
the
frolics
of
two
kittens
at
her
side
and
a
third
of
jesus
bleeding
and
crowned
with
thorns
high
on
a
cross
over
a
marble
city
beneath
a
romantic
forest
ridge
behind
which
was
the
conflagration
of
a
crimson
sunset
other
were
similarly
adorned
with
the
addition
of
a
picture
of
john
wesley
as
a
child
escaping
from
the
window
of
a
burning
house
with
many
anxious
men
holding
up
their
hands
from
below
the
smell
of
flowers
and
of
furniture
and
old
upholstery
mingles
in
such
rooms
but
the
kitchens
are
often
as
charming
as
in
wales
i
remember
one
especially
near
carn
galver
the
farmhouse
was
of
whitened
stone
under
a
steep
thatch
in
front
were
fuchsia
trees
in
the
corner
of
a
stony
yard
to
one
side
the
haystacks
and
piles
of
furze
and
bracken
and
peat
the
wife
was
carrying
peat
on
an
iron
hook
into
the
kitchen
and
i
followed
her
a
pan
of
yellow
scalded
cream
stood
inside
the
fireplace
was
a
little
room
in
itself
with
seats
at
each
side
and
a
little
fire
of
wood
and
three
upright
turves
in
one
corner
of
the
great
stone
hearth
over
the
fire
the
kettle
boiled
horse
ornaments
of
polished
brass
surmounted
the
fireplace
the
wallpaper
had
given
up
its
pattern
long
since
to
a
smoky
uneven
gold
nailed
to
it
were
calendars
and
lists
of
fairs
and
sales
against
it
were
two
small
tables
one
to
support
a
bible
and
an
almanac
the
other
spread
with
a
white
cloth
on
which
was
a
plate
and
a
bowl
of
cream
behind
the
door
and
between
it
and
the
fire
was
a
settle
of
dark
wood
with
the
floor
was
flagged
and
sanded
the
light
came
in
through
a
little
square
window
on
to
the
bible
by
the
opposite
wall
and
through
the
open
door
on
to
the
figure
of
the
housewife
a
woman
of
forty
a
delicate
white
face
shone
beneath
a
broad
untrimmed
straw
hat
that
was
tied
tightly
under
her
chin
so
as
to
hide
her
ears
and
most
of
her
black
hair
her
black
skirt
was
kilted
up
behind
a
white
apron
contrasted
with
black
shoes
black
stockings
and
black
clothes
at
first
her
face
was
hardly
seen
not
only
because
but
a
part
of
it
emerged
from
the
shell
of
her
hat
but
because
the
spirit
that
emanated
from
it
was
more
than
the
colour
and
features
and
so
much
in
harmony
with
the
sea
and
crag
and
moor
and
dolmen
of
her
land
it
is
evading
an
insuperable
difficulty
to
say
that
this
spirit
was
not
so
much
human
as
fay
it
was
the
spirit
of
which
her
milky
complexion
the
bright
black
eyes
white
teeth
and
fine
red
lips
of
her
readily
smiling
and
naïvely
watching
fearless
face
her
slender
form
her
light
and
rapid
movements
upon
small
feet
were
only
the
more
obvious
expressions
her
spirit
danced
before
her
not
quite
visibly
not
quite
audibly
as
she
moved
or
spoke
or
merely
smiled
if
it
could
have
been
seen
it
would
have
been
a
little
singing
white
flame
changing
to
blue
and
crimson
in
its
perpetual
flickering
it
was
a
spirit
of
laughter
of
laughter
unquenchable
since
the
beginning
of
time
of
laughter
in
spite
of
and
because
of
all
things
the
laughter
of
life
like
a
jewel
in
desolate
places
it
was
a
spirit
most
ancient
and
yet
childlike
birdlike
it
belonged
to
a
world
outside
any
which
other
human
beings
ever
seemed
to
touch
but
the
laughter
in
it
made
it
friendly
for
it
was
far
deeper
than
humour
it
was
gaiety
of
heart
her
goings
to
and
fro
on
those
light
feet
had
the
grace
quickness
suddenness
of
a
bird
of
a
wren
that
slips
from
twig
to
twig
and
jets
out
its
needle
of
song
of
a
moorhen
flicking
its
tail
and
hooting
sharply
her
laugh
startled
and
delighted
like
the
laugh
of
the
woodpecker
as
it
leaps
across
the
glades
like
the
whistling
of
birds
up
amongst
the
dark
clouds
and
the
moon
but
most
of
all
she
called
to
mind
the
meadow
pipit
of
her
own
crags
that
rises
from
green
ledges
out
over
the
sea
and
then
falling
slantwise
with
body
curved
like
a
crescent
utters
his
passionate
pulsating
song
so
rapid
and
passionate
that
it
seems
impossible
and
unfit
that
it
should
end
except
in
death
yet
suddenly
ceasing
as
it
lands
again
upon
the
samphire
or
the
thrift
the
spirit
was
as
quicksilver
in
the
corners
of
her
eyes
as
quicksilver
in
the
heart
such
a
maid
she
must
have
been
as
the
bard
would
have
thought
to
send
out
the
thrush
to
woo
for
him
when
he
heard
the
bird
of
ermine
breast
singing
from
the
hazel
at
dawn
on
the
edge
of
a
brook
among
the
steep
woods
singing
artfully
with
a
voice
like
a
silver
bell
solemnly
too
so
as
to
seem
to
be
performing
a
sacrifice
and
amorously
bringing
balm
to
hearts
and
inspiring
the
bard
to
send
by
him
a
message
to
the
sun
of
all
maidens
that
she
white
as
the
snow
of
the
first
winter
night
should
come
out
to
the
green
woods
to
him
she
had
lived
for
generations
on
the
moor
for
generations
upon
generations
and
this
was
what
she
had
gained
from
heather
and
furze
and
crag
and
seawind
and
sunshine
tempered
by
no
trees
inextinguishable
laughter
but
she
was
inarticulate
she
milked
the
cows
made
butter
baked
bread
kept
the
peat
fire
burning
and
tended
her
children
when
she
talked
i
asked
for
more
cream
perhaps
after
several
more
generations
have
passed
she
will
be
a
poet
and
astonish
the
world
with
a
moorland
laughter
of
words
that
endure
everything
in
that
house
was
old
or
smooth
and
bright
with
use
and
the
hollowed
threshold
of
the
doorway
in
the
sun
put
me
in
mind
of
a
hundred
old
things
and
of
their
goodliness
to
mortal
eyes
the
wrecked
ribs
their
rusty
that
stand
among
nettles
as
the
worn
dark
stones
that
rock
to
the
tread
among
the
ripples
of
an
umbrageous
ford
many
a
polished
stile
and
gate
the
group
of
rigid
but
still
gracious
bowery
thorns
dotted
with
crimson
haws
in
the
middle
of
a
meadow
their
holes
and
lower
branches
rubbed
hard
and
smooth
and
ruddy
like
iron
by
the
cows
the
ash
staff
beginning
to
bend
like
its
master
the
old
man
upon
the
roads
who
once
wore
scarlet
and
wound
the
horn
for
hounds
odd
it
is
how
old
use
sanctifies
a
little
thing
there
was
once
a
hut
where
a
good
man
but
a
poor
and
a
weak
and
unwise
stayed
all
one
fair
summer
and
talked
of
english
roads
he
was
a
lord
of
the
roads
at
least
of
south
country
roads
and
of
ships
which
he
knew
now
on
the
first
night
of
his
stay
needing
a
candlestick
he
kicked
off
the
top
of
a
pointed
wooden
paling
so
as
to
make
a
piece
on
which
he
stuck
the
candle
in
its
own
grease
all
through
his
stay
he
used
the
candlestick
when
he
read
the
and
and
and
recollected
airs
of
italy
and
spain
amidst
the
sound
of
nightjars
and
two
leafy
streams
the
light
flickered
out
as
he
mused
about
the
open
sea
calm
but
boundless
and
without
known
harbour
on
which
he
was
drifting
cheerfully
regardless
of
time
pied
with
nights
and
days
the
hut
was
burnt
and
the
man
went
to
drown
a
little
afterwards
with
a
hundred
unlike
himself
in
the
sea
but
among
nettle
and
dock
the
candlestick
was
picked
up
safe
it
had
broken
off
straight
and
the
simple
shape
was
pleasant
it
was
dark
with
age
along
with
the
mound
and
little
pillar
of
wax
remaining
it
had
the
shape
of
a
natural
thing
and
it
was
his
animate
as
well
as
inanimate
things
are
open
to
this
sanctification
by
age
or
use
i
am
not
here
thinking
of
ceremonious
use
for
which
i
have
small
natural
respect
so
that
i
have
been
denied
the
power
of
appreciating
either
a
great
religious
pomp
or
the
dancing
of
mademoiselle
genée
but
some
men
particularly
sailors
and
field
labourers
but
also
navvies
and
others
who
work
heavily
with
their
hands
have
this
glory
of
use
their
faces
their
clothes
their
natures
all
appear
to
act
and
speak
harmoniously
so
that
they
cause
a
strong
impression
of
personality
which
is
to
be
deeply
enjoyed
in
a
world
of
masks
especially
of
black
clerical
masks
one
of
the
best
examples
of
this
kind
was
a
gamekeeper
who
daily
preceded
me
by
twenty
or
thirty
yards
in
a
morning
walk
up
through
a
steep
wood
of
beeches
he
was
a
short
and
stoutish
man
who
wore
a
cap
thick
skirted
coat
and
breeches
leather
gaiters
and
heavy
boots
all
patched
and
stained
all
of
nearly
the
same
colour
as
his
hair
and
weathered
skin
but
not
so
dark
as
the
gun
over
his
shoulder
the
shades
of
this
colour
were
countless
and
made
up
like
the
colour
of
a
field
of
ripe
wheat
which
they
would
have
resembled
had
they
not
been
liberally
dusted
all
over
just
as
his
brown
beard
was
grizzled
he
went
slowly
up
swinging
slightly
at
the
shoulders
and
always
smoking
a
pipe
of
strong
shag
tobacco
of
which
the
fumes
hovered
in
the
moist
air
with
inexpressible
sweetness
and
a
good
brown
savour
if
i
may
say
so
the
fit
emanation
of
the
brown
woodland
man
who
when
he
stood
still
looked
like
the
stump
of
a
tree
chapter
x
summer
sussex
far
up
on
the
downs
the
air
of
day
and
night
is
flavoured
by
honeysuckle
and
new
hay
it
is
good
to
walk
it
is
good
to
lie
still
the
rain
is
good
and
so
is
the
sun
and
whether
the
windy
or
the
quiet
air
be
the
better
let
us
leave
to
a
december
judgment
to
decide
one
day
the
rain
falls
and
there
is
no
wind
and
all
the
movement
is
in
the
chaos
of
the
dark
sky
and
thus
is
made
the
celestial
fairness
of
an
earth
that
is
brighter
than
the
heavens
for
the
green
and
lilac
of
the
grasses
and
the
yellow
of
the
flowers
glow
and
the
ripening
corn
is
airy
light
but
next
day
the
sun
is
early
hot
the
wet
hay
steams
and
is
sweet
the
beams
pour
into
a
southward
coombe
of
the
hills
and
the
dense
yew
is
warm
as
a
so
that
the
utmost
of
fragrance
is
extracted
from
the
marjoram
and
thyme
and
fanned
by
the
coming
and
going
of
butterflies
and
in
contrast
with
this
gold
and
purple
heat
on
flower
and
wing
through
the
blue
sky
and
along
the
moist
clouds
are
trooping
of
the
grey
colour
of
melting
snow
the
great
shadows
of
the
clouds
brood
long
over
the
hay
and
in
the
darker
hollows
the
wind
rustles
the
dripping
thickets
until
on
another
morning
after
night
rain
the
blue
sky
is
rippled
and
crimped
with
high
thin
white
clouds
by
several
opposing
breezes
vast
forces
seem
but
now
to
have
ceased
their
feud
the
battle
is
over
and
there
are
all
the
signs
of
it
plain
to
be
seen
but
they
have
laid
down
their
arms
and
peace
is
broad
and
white
in
the
sky
but
of
many
colours
on
the
earth
for
there
is
blue
of
harebell
and
purple
of
among
the
bracken
and
popping
gorse
and
heather
and
foxglove
are
purple
above
the
sand
and
the
mint
is
hoary
lilac
the
is
foam
there
is
rose
of
and
yellow
of
fleabane
at
the
edge
of
the
water
and
purple
of
gentian
and
cistus
yellow
on
the
downs
and
infinite
greens
in
those
little
dense
edens
which
nettle
and
and
bramble
and
elder
make
every
summer
on
the
banks
of
the
deep
lanes
a
thousand
swifts
wheel
as
if
in
a
fierce
wind
over
the
highest
places
of
the
hills
over
the
great
camp
and
its
three
graves
and
antique
thorns
down
to
the
chestnuts
that
stand
about
the
rickyards
in
the
cornland
below
these
are
the
hours
that
seem
to
entice
and
entrap
the
airy
inhabitants
of
some
land
beyond
the
cloud
mountains
that
rise
farther
than

farthest

legend
has
it
that
long
ago
strange
children
were
caught
upon
the
earth
and
being
asked
how
they
had
come
there
they
said
that
one
day
as
they
were
herding
their
sheep
in
a
far
country
they
chanced
on
a
cave
and
within
they
heard
music
as
of
heavenly
bells
which
lured
them
on
and
on
through
the
corridors
of
that
cave
until
they
reached
our
earth
and
here
their
eyes
used
only
to
a
twilight
between
a
sun
that
had
set
for
ever
and
a
night
that
had
never
fallen
were
dazed
by
the
august
glow
and
lying
bemused
they
were
caught
before
they
could
find
the
earthly
entrance
to
their
cave
small
wonder
would
this
adventure
be
from
a
region
no
matter
how
blessed
when
the
earth
is
wearing
the
best
white
wild
roses
or
when
august
is
at
its
height
the
last
has
hardly
rolled
between
the
elms
before
the
reaper
and
the
begin
to
work
the
oats
and
wheat
are
in
tents
over
all
the
land
then
then
it
is
hard
not
to
walk
over
the
brown
in
the
green
of
august
grass
there
is
a
roving
spirit
everywhere
the
very
tents
of
the
corn
suggest
a
bivouac
the
white
clouds
coming
up
out
of
the
yellow
corn
and
journeying
over
the
blue
have
set
their
faces
to
some
goal
the
is
tangled
over
the
hazels
and
over
the
faces
of
the
small
the
white
beam
and
the
poplar
and
the
sycamore
fluttering
show
the
silver
sides
of
their
leaves
and
rustle
farewells
the
perfect
road
that
goes
without
hedges
under
elms
and
through
the
corn
says
all
and
how
the
bridges
overleap
the
streams
at
one
leap
or
at
three
in
arches
like
those
of
running
hounds
the
placid
sunsets
pave
the
feet
of
the
spirit
with
many
a
road
to
joy
the
huge
vacant
halls
of
dawn
give
a
sense
of
godlike
power
but
it
is
hard
to
make
anything
like
a
truce
between
these
two
incompatible
desires
the
one
for
going
on
and
on
over
the
earth
the
other
that
would
settle
for
ever
in
one
place
as
in
a
grave
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
change
suppose
a
man
to
receive
notice
of
death
it
would
be
hard
to
decide
whether
to
walk
or
sail
until
the
end
seeing
no
man
or
none
but
strangers
or
to
sit
alone
and
by
thinking
or
not
thinking
to
make
the
change
to
come
as
little
as
is
permitted
the
two
desires
will
often
painfully
alternate
even
on
these
harvest
days
there
is
a
temptation
to
take
root
for
ever
in
some
corner
of
a
field
or
on
some
hill
from
which
the
world
and
the
clouds
can
be
seen
at
a
distance
for
the
wheat
is
as
red
as
the
most
red
sand
and
up
above
it
tower
the
elms
dark
prophets
persuading
to
silence
and
a
stillness
like
their
own
away
on
the
lesser
downs
the
fields
of
pale
oats
are
liquid
within
their
border
of
dark
woods
they
also
propose
deep
draughts
of
oblivion
and
rest
then
again
there
is
the
field
the
many
fields
where
a
regiment
of
shocks
of
oats
are
ranked
under
the
white
moon
between
rows
of
elms
on
the
level
sussex
land
not
far
from
the
sea
the
contrast
of
the
airy
matter
underfoot
and
the
thin
moon
overhead
with
the
massy
dark
trees
as
it
were
suspended
between
the
numbers
and
the
order
of
the
sheaves
their
inviolability
though
protected
but
by
the
gateway
through
which
they
are
seen
all
satisfy
the
soul
as
they
can
never
satisfy
the
frame
then
there
are
the
mists
before
heat
which
make
us
think
of
autumn
or
not
according
to
our
tempers
all
night
the
aspens
have
been
shivering
and
the
owls
exulting
under
a
clear
full
moon
and
above
the
silver
of
a
great
dew
you
climb
the
steep
chalk
slope
through
the
privet
and
coppice
among
the
scattered
junipers
in
this
thick
haze
as
in
darkness
they
group
themselves
so
as
to
make
fantastic
likenesses
of
mounted
men
animals
monsters
over
the
dead
earth
in
the
shade
of
the
broad
yews
and
thence
suddenly
under
lightsome
sprays
of
and
their
berries
over
the
tufted
turf
and
then
through
the
massed
beeches
cold
and
dark
as
a
church
and
silent
and
so
out
to
the
level
waste
cornland
at
the
top
to
the
flints
and
the
clay
there
a
myriad
oriflammes
of
ragwort
are
borne
up
on
all
stems
of
equal
height
straight
and
motionless
and
near
at
hand
quite
clear
but
farther
away
forming
a
green
mist
until
farther
yet
all
but
the
flowery
surface
is
invisible
and
that
is
but
a
glow
the
stillness
of
the
green
and
golden
multitudes
under
the
grey
mist
perfectly
still
though
a
wind
flutters
the
high
tops
of
the
beech
has
an
immortal
beauty
and
that
they
should
ever
change
does
not
enter
the
mind
which
is
thus
for
the
moment
lured
happily
into
a
strange
confidence
and
ease
but
the
sun
gains
power
in
the
it
changes
the
mist
into
a
fleeting
garment
not
of
cold
or
of
warm
grey
but
of
diaphanous
gold
there
is
a
moan
of
wind
in
the
trees
a
wavering
of
the
mist
to
and
fro
until
it
is
dispersed
far
and
wide
as
part
of
the
very
light
of
the
blue
shade
of
the
colour
of
cloud
and
wood
and
down
as
the
mist
is
unwoven
the
ghostly
moon
is
disclosed
and
a
bank
of
dead
white
clouds
where
the
downs
should
be
under
the
very
eye
of
the
veiled
sun
a
golden
light
and
warmth
begins
to
nestle
among
the
mounds
of
foliage
at
the
surface
of
the
low
woods
the
beeches
close
by
have
got
a
new
voice
in
their
crisp
cool
leaves
of
which
every
one
is
doing
something
cool
though
the
air
itself
is
warm
coo
the
white
gives
way
to
an
immeasurable
of
downs
some
bare
some
with
woods
and
far
away
and
below
out
of
the
ocean
of
countless
trees
in
the
southern
veil
a
spire
it
is
a
spire
which
at
this
hour
is
doubtless
moving
a
thousand
men
with
a
thousand
thoughts
and
hopes
and
memories
of
men
and
causes
but
moves
me
with
the
thought
alone
that
just
a
hundred
years
ago
was
buried
underneath
it
a
child
a
little
child
whose
mother
was
at
the
pains
to
inscribe
a
tablet
saying
to
all
who
pass
by
that
he
was
once
amiable
and
most
endearing
and
what
nights
there
are
on
the
hills
the
break
up
the
low
full
moon
into
a
flower
of
many
sparks
the
downs
are
heaved
up
into
the
lighted
sky
surely
they
heave
in
their
tranquillity
as
with
a
slowly
taken
breath
the
moon
is
up
the
sky
and
exactly
over
the
centre
of
the
long
curve
of
downs
just
above
them
lies
a
long
terrace
of
white
cloud
and
at
their
feet
gleams
a
broad
pond
the
rest
of
the
valley
being
utterly
dark
and
indistinguishable
save
a
few
scattered
lamps
and
one
near
meadow
that
catches
the
moonlight
so
as
to
be
transmuted
to
a
lake
but
every
rainy
leaf
upon
the
hill
is
brighter
than
any
of
the
few
stars
above
and
from
many
leaves
and
blades
hang
drops
as
large
and
bright
as
the
glowworms
in
their
recesses
larger
by
a
little
but
not
brighter
are
the
threes
and
fours
of
lights
at
windows
in
the
valley
the
wind
has
fallen
but
a
mile
of
woods
unlading
the
rain
from
their
leaves
make
a
sound
of
wind
while
each
separate
drop
can
be
heard
from
the
nearest
branches
a
noise
of
rapt
content
as
if
they
were
telling
over
again
the
kisses
of
the
shower
the
air
itself
is
heavy
as
mead
with
the
scent
of
yew
and
juniper
and
thyme
chapter
xi
hampshire
an
umbrella
man
a
beggar
is
a
rich
man
on
some
of
these
august
days
especially
one
i
know
whom
first
i
met
some
augusts
ago
now
a
fine
sunday
afternoon
had
sprinkled
the
quiet
and
land
with
men
and
women
the
older
married
couples
and
their
trains
of
children
keeping
chiefly
to
the
roads
and
most
straightforward
paths
the
younger
with
one
child
or
none
choosing
rather
the
green
lanes
while
the
lovers
and
the
boys
found
out
tall
and
the
footpaths
across
which
more
than
one
growth
of
hazel
had
spread
so
that
the
shortest
of
the
maids
must
stoop
many
showers
following
a
dry
season
made
miles
of
the
country
as
clean
and
fragrant
as
a
garden
honeysuckle
and
privet
were
in
every
hedge
with
flowers
that
bring
a
thrill
of
summer
bridals
on
their
scent
the
brisk
wind
was
thymy
from
the
downs
the
ragwort
was
in
its
glory
it
rose
tall
as
a
man
in
one
straight
leap
of
stem
and
then
crowned
itself
in
the
boldest
and
most
splendid
yellows
derived
from
a
dark
golden
disc
and
almost
lemon
rays
it
was
as
if
apollo
had
come
down
to
keep
the
flocks
of
a
farmer
on
these
chalk
hills
and
his
pomp
had
followed
him
out
of
the
sky
a
few
birds
still
sang
one
lark
now
and
then
a
among
the
topmost
haws
of
a
thorn
chiffchaffs
in
the
bittersweet
and
hazel
of
the
little
copses
there
was
apparently
comfort
abundance
and
quiet
everywhere
they
were
seen
in
the
rickyards
where
grand
haystacks
newly
thatched
stood
around
ancient
even
the
beeches
had
a
decorous
look
in
their
smooth
boles
and
perfect
lavish
foliage
the
little
patches
of
flowery
turf
by
the
roadside
and
at
corners
were
brighter
and
warmer
than
ever
as
the
black
bees
and
the
tawny
skipper
butterflies
flew
from
bloom
to
bloom
of
the
crimson
knapweed
amplest
and
most
unctuous
of
all
in
their
expression
of
the
ceremonious
leisure
of
the
day
and
the
maturity
of
the
season
were
the
they
leaned
their
large
heads
benignly
over
the
rails
or
gates
their
roan
or
chestnut
flanks
were
firm
and
polished
manes
tails
and
fetlocks
spotless
now
and
then
they
lifted
up
their
feet
and
pressed
their
toes
into
the
ground
showing
their
enormous
shoes
that
shone
and
were
of
girth
sufficient
to
make
a
girdle
for
the
lightest
of
the
maids
passing
by
sunday
with
not
too
strict
a
rod
of
black
and
white
ruled
the
land
and
made
it
all
but
tedious
except
in
the
longest
of
the
green
lanes
which
dipped
steeply
under
oaks
to
a
brook
muffled
in
leaves
and
rose
steeply
again
a
track
so
wet
in
spring
and
full
of
the
modest
golden
green
of
saxifrage
flowers
that
only
the
hottest
sunday
ever
saw
it
disturbed
except
by
carter
and
horses
in
a
hundred
yards
the
windings
gave
the
traveller
a
feeling
of
reclusion
as
if
he
were
coiled
in
a
spool
very
soon
a
feeling
of
possession
ripened
into
one
of
armed
tyranny
if
steps
clattered
on
the
stones
above
sometimes
in
a
goodly
garden
a
straight
alley
of
shadows
leads
away
from
the
bright
frequented
borders
to
we
know
not
quite
whither
and
perhaps
too
much
delighted
with
reverie
never
learn
smother
even
the
guesses
of
fancy
lest
they
should
bring
some
old
unpleasant
truth
in
their
train
but
if
the
fancy
will
thread
the
alley
and
pass
the
last
of
the
shadows
it
is
into
some
such
lane
as
this
that
it
would
gladly
emerge
to
come
at
last
upon
the
pure
wild
it
seemed
that
i
had
come
upon
the
pure
wild
in
this
lane
for
in
a
bay
of
turf
alongside
the
track
just
large
enough
for
a
hut
and
thickly
sheltered
by
an
oak
though
the
sun
crept
in
was
a
camp
under
the
oak
and
at
the
edge
of
the
tangled
bramble
and
brier
and
bracken
was
a
low
purple
light
from
those
woodside
flowers
and
a
perambulator
with
a
cabbage
in
it
stood
at
one
corner
leaning
against
it
was
an
umbrella
and
two
or
three
underneath
it
an
old
bag
containing
a
hammer
and
other
tools
close
by
stood
half
a
loaf
on
a
newspaper
several
bottles
of
bright
water
a
black
pot
of
potatoes
ready
for
boiling
a
tin
of
water
steaming
against
a
small
fire
of
hazel
twigs
out
on
the
sunny
grass
two
shirts
were
drying
in
the
midst
was
the
proprietor
his
name
revealed
in
fresh
chalk
on
the
side
of
his
perambulator
clark
he
had
spent
his
last
pence
on
potatoes
and
had
been
given
the
cabbage
no
one
would
give
him
work
on
a
sunday
he
had
no
home
no
relations
being
deaf
he
did
not
look
for
company
so
he
stood
up
to
get
dry
and
to
think
think
think
his
hands
on
his
hips
while
he
puffed
at
an
empty
pipe
during
his
meditation
a
snail
had
crawled
up
his
trousers
and
was
now
all
but
down
again
he
was
of
middle
height
and
build
the
crookedest
of
men
yet
upright
like
a
branch
of
oak
which
comes
straight
with
all
its
twistings
his
head
was
small
and
round
almost
covered
by
bristly
grey
hair
like
lichen
through
which
peered
quiet
blue
eyes
the
face
was
irregular
almost
shapeless
like
dough
being
kneaded
worn
by
travel
passion
pain
and
not
a
few
blows
where
the
skin
was
visible
at
all
through
the
hair
it
was
like
red
sandstone
his
teeth
were
white
and
strong
and
short
like
an
old
his
rough
neck
descended
into
a
striped
shirt
to
which
was
added
a
loose
black
waistcoat
divided
into
thin
perpendicular
stripes
by
ribs
of
faded
gold
his
trousers
loose
and
patched
and
short
approached
the
colour
of
a
hen
pheasant
his
bare
feet
were
partly
hidden
by
old
black
boots
his
voice
was
hoarse
and
for
one
of
his
enduring
look
surprisingly
small
and
produced
with
an
effort
and
a
slight
jerk
of
the
head
he
was
a
sussex
man
born
in
the
year
on
june
the
it
seemed
a
foppery
in
him
to
remember
the
day
and
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
with
what
ceremony
he
had
remembered
it
year
by
year
during
half
a
century
or
near
it
on
the
roads
of
sussex
kent
surrey
and
hampshire
his
mother
was
a
wild
there
were
several
of
them
buried
not
far
away
under
the
carved
tombstones
by
the
old
church
with
the
lancet
windows
and
the
four
yews
he
was
a
son
and
he
had
already
had
a
long
life
of
hoeing
and
reaping
and
fagging
when
he
enlisted
at
chatham
he
had
kept
his
musket
bright
slept
hard
and
wet
and
starved
on
thirteenpence
a
day
moving
from
camp
to
camp
every
two
years
he
had
lost
his
youth
in
battle
for
a
bullet
went
through
his
knee
he
lay
four
months
in
hospital
and
they
took
eighteen
pieces
of
bone
out
of
his
wound
he
was
still
indignant
because
he
was
described
as
only
when
he
was
discharged
after
a
of
thirteen
years
he
showed
his
gnarled
knee
to
explain
his
crookedness
little
he
could
tell
of
the
battle
except
the
sobbing
of
the
soldier
next
to
him
london
chap
from
haggerston
way
lord
he
called
for
his
mother
and
his
god
and
me
to
save
him
and
the
noise
he
made
was
worse
than
the
firing
and
the
groaning
of
the
horses
and
i
was
just
thinking
how
i
could
stop
his
mouth
for
him
when
a
bullet
hits
me
and
down
i
goes
like
a
he
had
been
on
the
road
forty
years
for
a
short
time
after
his
discharge
he
worked
on
the
land
and
lived
in
a
cottage
with
his
wife
and
one
child
the
church
bells
were
beginning
to
ring
and
i
asked
him
if
he
was
going
to
church
at
first
he
said
nothing
but
looked
down
at
his
striped
waistcoat
and
patched
trousers
then
with
a
quick
violent
gesture
of
scorn
he
lifted
up
his
head
and
even
threw
it
back
before
he
spoke
he
said
remember
how
it
was
my
little
girl
died
my
little
girl
says
i
but
she
would
have
been
a
big
handsome
woman
now
years
old
on
the
first
of
may
that
is
gone
she
was
lying
in
bed
with
a
little
bit
of
a
cough
and
she
was
gone
as
white
as
a
lily
and
i
went
in
to
her
when
i
came
home
from
reaping
i
saw
she
looked
bad
and
like
a
fish
in
a
hedge
and
something
came
over
me
and
i
caught
hold
of
both
her
hands
in
both
of
mine
and
held
them
tight
and
put
my
head
close
up
to
hers
and
said
look
here
polly
got
to
get
well
your
mother
and
me
stand
losing
you
and
you
meant
to
die
such
a
one
as
you
be
for
a
and
i
squeezed
her
little
hands
and
all
my
nature
seemed
to
rise
up
and
try
to
make
her
get
well
polly
she
looked
whiter
than
ever
and
afraid
i
suppose
i
was
a
bit
rough
and
dirty
and
sunburnt
for
a
hot
harvest
and
the
end
of
the
second
week
of
it
and
i
was
that
fierce
i
felt
i
ought
to
have
had
my
way
all
that
night
i
thought
i
had
done
a
wrong
thing
trying
to
keep
her
from
dying
that
way
and
i
tell
you
i
cried
in
case
i
had
done
any
harm
by
it
that
very
night
she
died
without
our
knowing
it
she
was
a
bonny
maid
that
fond
of
flowers
the
night
she
was
taken
ill
she
was
coming
home
with
me
from
the
thirteen
acre
where
been
hoeing
the
mangolds
and
she
had
picked
a
rose
for
her
mother
all
of
a
sudden
she
looks
at
it
and
says
gone
broke
gone
gone
gone
gone
and
she
kept
on
broke
gone
gone
and
when
she
got
home
she
ran
up
to
her
mother
crying
wild
rose
is
broke
mother
broke
gone
gone
she
says
just
like
that
said
the
old
man
in
a
high
finical
voice
more
like
that
of
a
bird
than
a
child
my
old
woman
well
she
was
only
a
bit
of
a
wench
too
seventeen
when
we
were
married
she
took
ill
and
died
within
a
week
after
there
was
a
purpose
in
it
it
was
then
the
end
of
harvest
i
spent
all
my
wages
down
at
the
fighting
cocks
and
then
i
set
out
to
walk
to
mildenhall
in
wiltshire
where
my
wife
came
from
on
the
way
i
met
a
chap
i
had
quarrelled
with
in
egypt
and
he
says
to
me
jack
with
a
sort
of
look
and
i
not
thinking
what
i
did
i
set
about
him
and
before
i
knew
it
he
was
lying
there
as
might
be
dead
and
i
went
and
gave
myself
up
and
i
mind
saying
that
i
wished
i
might
be
hanged
for
it
however
i
did
six
months
that
was
how
i
came
to
be
in
the
umbrella
line
i
took
up
with
a
chap
who
did
a
bit
of
tinkering
and
and
grinding
in
the
roving
way
and
a
job
of
hoeing
or
mowing
now
and
then
he
died
not
so
very
long
after
in
the
year
of
the
siege
of
paris
and
i
have
been
alone
ever
since
nor
i
been
to
church
since
any
more
than
a
blackbird
would
go
and
perch
on
the
shoulder
of
one
of
those
ladies
with
feathers
and
wings
and
a
bit
of
a
fox
in
their
labourer
soldier
labourer
tinker
umbrella
man
he
had
always
wandered
and
knew
the
south
country
between
fordingbridge
and
dover
as
a
man
knows
his
garden
every
village
almost
every
farmhouse
especially
if
there
were
hops
on
the
land
he
knew
and
could
see
with
his
blue
eyes
as
he
remembered
them
and
spoke
their
names
i
never
met
a
man
who
knew
england
as
he
did
as
he
talked
of
places
his
eyes
were
alight
and
turned
in
their
direction
and
his
arm
stretched
out
to
point
moving
as
he
went
through
his
itinerary
so
that
verily
wherever
he
was
he
seemed
to
carry
in
his
head
the
relative
positions
of
all
the
other
places
where
he
had
laboured
and
drunk
and
lit
his
solitary
fire
you
ever
at
h
he
said
pointing
to
the
downs
through
which
he
seemed
to
see
h
itself
that
commanded
us
lived
there
he
died
there
three
years
ago
at
the
age
of
and
till
he
died
i
was
always
sure
of
a
if
i
called
there
on
a
christmas
eve
as
i
generally
managed
to
of
any
place
mentioned
he
could
presently
remember
something
significant
the
words
of
a
farmer
a
song
a
signboard
a
wonderful
crop
the
good
ale
the
fact
that
years
ago
the
squire
used
to
go
to
church
in
a
smock
frock
all
the
time
his
face
was
moved
with
free
and
broad
expressions
as
he
thought
and
remembered
like
an
face
living
alone
and
never
having
to
fit
himself
into
human
society
he
had
not
learnt
to
keep
his
face
in
a
vice
he
was
returning
if
the
grave
was
not
too
near
at
the
age
of
to
a
primeval
wildness
and
simplicity
it
was
a
pleasure
to
see
him
smoke
to
note
how
it
eased
his
chest
to
see
him
spit
and
be
the
better
for
it
the
outdoor
life
had
brought
him
rheumatism
but
a
clear
brain
also
and
a
wild
purity
a
physical
cleanliness
too
and
it
was
like
being
with
a
horse
to
stand
beside
him
and
this
his
house
was
full
of
the
scent
of
the
bracken
growing
under
the
oaks
earth
had
not
been
a
kind
but
a
stern
mother
like
some
brawny
housewife
with
many
children
who
spends
all
her
long
days
baking
and
washing
and
making
clothes
and
tending
the
sick
one
and
cutting
bread
and
pouring
out
tea
and
cuffing
one
and
cuddling
another
and
listening
to
tale
and
hushing
their
unanimous
chatter
with
a
shout
or
a
bang
of
her
enormous
elbow
on
the
table
the
blows
of
such
a
one
are
shrewd
but
they
are
not
as
the
sweetness
of
her
nursing
voice
for
enduring
in
the
memory
of
bearded
men
and
women
once
or
twice
again
i
met
him
in
later
summers
near
the
same
place
the
last
time
he
had
been
in
the
infirmary
and
was
much
older
his
fire
was
under
the
dense
shelf
of
a
spruce
bough
in
a
green
deserted
road
worn
deep
in
the
chalk
blocked
at
both
ends
and
trodden
by
few
mortal
feet
only
a
few
yards
away
under
another
spruce
lay
a
most
ancient
sheep
who
had
apparently
been
turned
into
the
lane
to
browse
at
peace
she
was
lame
in
one
leg
and
often
fed
as
she
knelt
her
head
was
dark
grey
and
wise
her
eyes
pearly
green
and
iridescent
with
an
oblong
pupil
of
quiet
yet
full
of
fear
her
wool
was
dense
but
short
and
of
a
cinder
grey
her
dark
horny
feet
were
overgrown
from
lack
of
use
she
would
not
budge
even
when
a
dog
sniffed
at
her
but
only
bowed
her
head
and
threatened
vainly
to
butt
she
was
huge
and
heavy
and
content
though
always
all
alone
as
she
lay
there
her
wool
glistening
with
rain
i
had
often
wondered
what
those
eyes
were
aware
of
what
part
she
played
in
the
summer
harmonies
of
night
and
day
the
full
night
heavens
and
cloudless
noon
storm
and
dawn
and
the
long
moist
heat
of
dewy
mornings
she
was
now
shorn
and
the
old
man
watched
her
as
he
drank
the
liquor
in
which
a
cabbage
and
a
piece
of
bacon
had
been
boiled
often
thinks
he
said
i
be
something
like
that
sheep
but
not
now
haha
left
alone
in
this
here
lane
to
browse
a
bit
while
the
fine
and
folks
are
kind
but
i
know
but
what
she
is
better
off
look
there
he
said
pointing
to
a
wound
which
the
shearer
had
made
in
one
of
her
nipples
where
flies
clustered
like
a
hideous
flower
of
crape
have
been
spending
this
hour
and
more
flicking
the
flies
off
her
nobody
do
that
for
me
unless
i
come
in
for
five
shillings
a
week
old
age
pension
but
i
reckon
that
be
for
a
roving
body
like
me
without
a
in
the
neighbouring
field
a
shook
herself
with
a
noise
of
thunder
and
laughed
shrilly
and
threw
up
her
heels
and
raced
along
the
hedge
a
bee
could
be
seen
going
in
and
out
of
the
transparent
white
flowers
of
convolvulus
the
horse
had
her
youth
and
strength
and
a
workless
day
before
her
the
bee
its
business
in
which
was
its
life
among
sunbeams
and
flowers
and
they
were
glad
the
old
man
smacked
his
lips
as
he
drained
the
salty
broth
tried
three
times
to
light
his
empty
pipe
and
then
knocked
out
the
ashes
and
spat
vigorously
and
took
a
turn
up
the
lane
alone
in
the
scent
of
the
bracken
chapter
xii
children
of
earth
hampshire
and
sussex
at
the
end
of
the
lane
at
the
head
of
one
of
the
beechen
chalky
coombes
just
where
the
beeches
cease
and
the
flinty
clay
begins
stands
a
thatched
cottage
under
five
tall
a
grassy
lane
runs
by
but
on
three
sides
the
place
is
surrounded
by
huge
naked
concave
sweeps
of
grey
ploughland
which
take
the
february
sunshine
and
cloud
shadow
as
delicately
as
beaten
silver
the
walls
are
of
soft
stone
but
only
a
little
of
them
is
visible
because
the
steep
thatch
sweeps
almost
to
the
ground
and
overhangs
the
gables
in
each
of
which
is
a
small
window
and
under
one
a
door
in
hot
summer
or
windy
winter
if
the
field
happens
to
be
without
a
crop
the
earth
is
of
the
same
colour
as
the
thatch
and
the
cottage
looks
as
if
it
were
the
work
like
a
of
some
creature
that
has
worked
underground
and
risen
up
just
there
and
rested
peering
out
of
the
two
dark
windows
upon
the
world
it
is
impossible
to
find
any
point
of
view
from
which
any
house
can
be
seen
along
with
this
except
one
the
the
tall
hazels
of
the
lane
or
the
swelling
fields
hide
them
away
but
the
pewits
loop
their
flight
every
spring
over
and
round
about
the
cottage
and
the
dark
eyes
under
the
thatch
can
always
see
a
hare
and
often
whether
the
ashes
are
purple
in
spring
yellow
in
autumn
or
grey
in
winter
whether
the
surrounding
fields
are
bare
or
green
with
turnips
or
yellow
with
charlock
or
empurpled
gold
with
ripe
wheat
the
cottage
is
always
the
same
stubborn
dull
simple
mound
raised
up
out
of
the
earth
the
one
other
house
is
not
so
high
nor
has
it
eyes
nor
do
an
old
man
and
a
girl
and
two
children
go
in
and
out
of
it
it
is
in
fact
not
a
house
of
the
living
but
of
the
dead
a
round
tumulus
at
the
edge
of
the
hill
the
grey
mound
of
the
dead
and
the
grey
house
of
the
living
are
at
their
best
in
the
midst
of
winter
and
in
the
midst
of
summer
standing
upon
the
tumulus
in
the
wind
the
cottage
could
be
seen
huddled
under
the
lashing
trees
many
a
thousand
on
the
steep
slopes
below
gave
out
a
roar
and
it
was
a
majestic
position
to
be
up
there
seeing
and
feeling
that
the
strong
wind
was
scouring
the
world
with
a
stream
miles
deep
and
miles
wide
far
underneath
two
beechen
promontories
with
bald
white
brows
projected
into
the
vast
valley
not
really
much
lower
than
the
hill
of
the
tumulus
but
seeming
so
in
that
more
than
amazonian
stream
of
air
beyond
these
promontories
the
broad
land
was
washed
bright
and
clear
nearer
at
hand
the
thrice
cleaned
was
as
silken
foam
surging
upon
the
surface
of
black
yews
and
olive
hazels
the
kestrel
swayed
and
lunged
in
his
flight
branches
gleamed
hard
and
nervously
moving
glittered
and
each
brittle
stem
and
flower
of
a
dead
plant
each
and
brown
lock
of
beech
or
gave
out
its
little
noise
to
join
the
oceanic
murmur
of
the
earth
now
and
then
a
dead
leaf
took
flight
rose
high
and
went
out
over
the
valley
till
it
was
invisible
never
descending
in
search
of
the
moon
near
the
horizon
a
loose
white
drift
went
rapidly
just
over
the
summits
of
the
highest
woods
but
in
the
upper
air
were
the
finest
flowers
of
the
wind
hard
white
flowers
of
cloud
flowers
and
mad
tresses
and
drapery
of
gods
and
some
small
and
white
like
as
if
up
there
also
they
travelled
and
knew
the
houseless
joy
along
the
undulating
highway
of
the
deep
wind
and
the
little
house
was
as
a
planted
in
the
middle
swirl
of
the
current
that
was
scouring
valley
and
wood
and
sky
and
water
and
as
far
as
it
could
the
dull
eyes
and
duller
brains
of
men
in
summer
i
saw
it
at
the
end
of
one
of
those
days
of
sun
and
wind
and
perfectly
clear
air
when
the
earth
appears
immensely
heavy
and
great
and
strong
so
that
for
a
moment
it
is
possible
to
know
the
majesty
of
its
course
in
space
and
the
sheep
very
light
like
mere
down
as
they
crawl
in
a
flock
over
the
grass
swathes
and
wisps
of
white
cloud
were
strewn
over
the
high
blue
sky
as
if
by
haymakers
but
the
lanes
were
deep
and
for
miles
at
a
time
nearly
shut
out
the
sky
and
all
the
day
the
lanes
were
empty
and
wholly
mine
here
the
high
banks
were
thickly
grown
with
wild
parsnip
and
its
umbels
of
small
flowers
fragrant
and
a
little
were
alive
and
as
it
were
boiling
over
with
bees
and
the
sunniest
flies
there
the
hazel
was
laced
with
white
bryony
whose
leaves
and
pale
tendrils
went
hovering
and
swimming
and
floating
over
the
hedge
in
one
place
an
stood
out
of
the
hedge
stiff
with
few
branches
and
every
leaf
upon
them
red
as
a
rose
wherever
there
was
a
waste
strip
beside
the
road
the
tall
yellow
ragwort
grew
densely
each
of
the
nearer
flowers
as
hard
and
clear
as
brass
the
farther
ones
dimly
glowing
and
half
lost
in
the
green
mist
of
their
leaves
and
the
haze
of
the
brightness
of
their
multitudes
where
the
road
changed
into
an
unused
lane
the
grass
was
tall
and
under
the
hazels
yet
fully
seen
were
the
wild
basil
and
marjoram
and
centaury
and
knapweed
and
and
over
them
hung
moths
of
green
silk
there
too
were
the
plants
that
smell
most
of
the
dry
summer
the
white
parsleys
and
the
white
or
rosy
the
bedstraws
white
and
yellow
the
yellow
mugwort
now
and
then
the
hedges
gave
way
and
on
either
hand
was
open
turf
sloping
steep
and
rough
on
one
side
grooved
by
ancient
paths
of
men
and
cattle
dotted
by
thorns
with
the
freshly
flowering
over
them
at
the
top
on
the
other
side
level
skirted
by
cloudy
and
having
at
one
corner
a
white
inn
half
shadowed
by
a
walnut
and
two
sycamores
and
cattle
below
them
and
at
another
a
stately
autumnal
house
veiled
by
the
cedars
and
straight
yews
on
its
darkly
glowing
lawn
all
these
things
i
saw
as
if
they
had
been
my
own
as
if
i
were
going
again
slowly
through
old
treasures
long
hidden
away
so
that
they
were
memoried
and
yet
unexpected
nothing
was
too
small
to
be
seen
and
ascending
the
chalk
hill
among
the
beeches
every
white
flint
was
clear
on
the
sward
each
in
its
different
shape
many
chipped
as
the
most
cunning
chisel
would
be
proud
to
chip
them
one
for
example
carved
by
the
loss
of
two
exquisitely
curved
and
balanced
flakes
into
the
likeness
of
a
expanded
upper
wings
a
dark
beech
alley
paved
with
the
gold
and
green
of
moss
and
walled
by
crumbling
chalk
brought
me
to
the
tumulus
there
lay
the
old
house
in
shadow
its
ash
crests
lighted
yellow
by
horizontal
beams
that
caught
here
the
summit
of
a
wood
and
there
the
polished
grass
stems
on
a
rising
field
it
was
the
one
house
and
at
that
hour
it
gathered
to
itself
all
that
can
be
connected
with
a
home
it
was
alone
but
its
high
cool
thatch
was
full
of
protection
and
privacy
sufficient
against
sun
or
rain
or
wind
or
frost
yet
impregnated
with
free
air
and
light
its
communed
with
the
heavens
and
the
setting
sun
the
wheat
glowed
at
its
gates
the
dark
masses
of
the
lower
woods
enhanced
by
a
touch
of
primeval
gloom
and
savagery
the
welcoming
expression
of
the
house
slowly
the
light
died
out
of
the
and
the
wheat
turned
to
a
mist
the
wood
seemed
to
creep
up
close
and
lay
its
shadows
over
the
house
but
stronger
than
the
wood
and
the
oncoming
tide
of
night
that
enveloped
it
the
spirits
of
roof
and
wall
and
hearth
were
weaving
a
spell
about
the
house
to
guard
it
so
that
it
looked
a
living
breathing
dreaming
thing
nimble
elvish
but
wholly
kind
small
spirits
i
fancied
them
creeping
from
corners
in
stone
and
thatch
and
rafter
at
war
with
those
that
dwelt
in
lonely
and
dark
places
that
knew
not
fire
and
lamp
and
human
voices
save
as
invaders
for
a
little
while
there
was
a
pause
a
suspense
a
hesitation
could
the
small
spirits
win
were
not
the
woods
older
and
more
mighty
was
not
that
long
black
bar
of
cloud
across
the
cold
west
something
sinister
already
engulfing
the
frail
white
moon
but
suddenly
as
if
the
life
of
the
house
had
found
a
powerful
voice
one
eye
in
the
nearer
gable
was
lit
by
a
small
lamp
and
a
figure
could
be
guessed
behind
it
the
first
promethean
spark
of
fire
stolen
from
the
gods
was
hardly
a
more
signal
victory
than
that
at
which
the
house
and
i
rejoiced
when
the
white
light
glimmered
across
the
corn
it
seemed
the
birth
of
light
the
man
who
lives
under
that
roof
and
was
born
there
seventy
years
ago
is
like
his
house
he
is
short
and
immensely
broad
with
shaved
but
never
face
creased
by
a
wide
mouth
and
long
narrow
black
eyes
black
with
a
blackness
as
of
cold
deep
water
that
had
never
known
the
sun
but
only
the
of
discoverers
his
once
grey
corduroys
and
once
white
slop
are
stained
and
patched
to
something
like
the
colour
of
the
moist
channelled
thatch
and
crumbling
of
the
stone
walls
he
wears
a
soft
felt
hat
with
hanging
broad
brim
of
darker
earthy
hues
it
might
have
been
drawn
over
his
face
and
ears
in
his
emergence
from
his
native
clay
and
flint
only
rarely
does
his
eye
one
eye
at
a
time
gloom
out
from
underneath
always
accompanied
by
a
smile
that
slowly
puckers
the
wrinkled
of
his
stiff
cheeks
his
fingers
his
limbs
his
face
his
silence
suggest
crooked
oak
timber
or
the
gnarled
stoles
of
the
many
times
polled
ash
it
is
barely
credible
that
he
grew
out
of
a
child
the
son
of
a
woman
and
not
out
of
the
earth
itself
like
the
great
flints
that
work
upwards
and
out
on
to
the
surface
of
the
fields
doubtless
he
did
but
like
many
a
ruined
castle
like
his
own
house
he
has
been
worn
to
a
part
of
the
earth
itself
that
house
he
will
never
give
up
except
by
force
to
go
to
workhouse
or
grave
they
want
him
to
go
out
for
a
few
days
that
it
may
be
made
more
but
he
fears
the
chances
and
prefers
a
rickety
floor
and
draughty
wall
he
is
half
cowman
half
man
at
eight
shillings
a
week
in
his
last
days
mending
hedges
cleaning
ditches
and
carrying
a
sack
of
wheat
down
the
steep
hill
on
a
back
that
can
not
be
bent
any
farther
up
to
his
knees
in
the
february
ditch
or
cutting
in
the
copse
he
is
clearly
half
converted
into
the
element
to
which
he
must
return
when
the
underwood
is
for
sale
it
is
a
pleasure
to
read
the
notices
fixed
to
the
doors
of
barn
and
shed
with
the
names
of
the
copses
and
woods
at
penshurst
lately
for
example
i
saw
these
names
black
hoath
wood
heronry
pond
marlpit
field

ashour
farm
coppice
weir

well
place
i
was
back
in
time
remembering
that
genial
poem
of
ben
penshurst
and
especially
the
lines
copse
too
named
of
gamage
thou
hast
there
that
never
fails
to
serve
thee
deer
when
thou
wouldst
feed
or
exercise
thy
friends
the
lower
land
that
to
the
river
bends
thy
sheep
thy
bullocks
kine
and
calves
do
feed
the
middle
grounds
thy
mares
and
horses
breed
each
bank
doth
yield
thee
conies
and
the
tops
fertile
of
wood
ashore
and
copps
to
crown
thy
open
table
doth
provide
the
purple
pheasant
with
the
speckled
side
and
so
onward
to
that
opulence
and
ease
three
centuries
old
hath
thy
orchard
fruit
thy
garden
flowers
fresh
as
the
air
and
new
as
are
the
hours
the
early
cherry
with
the
later
plum
fig
grape
and
quince
each
in
his
time
doth
come
the
blushing
apricot
and
woolly
peach
hang
on
thy
walls
that
every
child
may
reach
and
though
thy
walls
be
of
the
country
stone
reared
with
no
ruin
no
groan
none
that
dwell
about
them
wish
them
down
but
all
come
in
the
farmer
and
the
clown
and
no
one
empty
handed
to
salute
thy
lord
and
lady
though
they
have
no
suit
some
bring
a
capon
some
a
rural
cake
some
nuts
some
apples
some
that
think
they
make
the
better
cheeses
bring
them
or
else
send
by
their
ripe
daughters
whom
they
would
commend
this
way
to
husbands
and
whose
baskets
bear
an
emblem
of
themselves
in
plum
or
pear
almost
to
such
a
time
as
that
does
the
old
man
carry
back
the
thoughts
his
old
master
was
the
fifth
in
the
direct
line
to
work
one
farm
in
the
vale
he
left
money
in
his
will
to
pay
for
new
smocks
all
of
the
best
linen
to
be
worn
by
the
labourers
who
should
carry
him
to
the
grave
the
old
man
has
three
companions
under
that
roof
the
hand
that
lit
the
lamp
is
his
the
youngest
by
the
second
wife
whom
he
married
when
he
was
fifty
the
other
two
are
her
children
and
she
is
unmarried
she
earns
no
money
except
by
keeping
a
few
fowls
and
bees
when
the
younger
child
was
born
the
old
man
having
to
go
six
miles
out
at
midnight
for
the
parish
doctor
the
married
women
commented
forgiveness
for
the
first
but
not
for
the
second
for
the
first
showed
indiscretion
carelessness
youth
the
second
helplessness
the
old
man
can
hardly
leave
the
children
and
though
he
is
deaf
he
will
when
he
is
told
that
the
baby
is
crying
go
to
the
room
and
listen
carefully
for
the
pleasure
of
the
infant
voice
that
voice
means
colder
winter
nights
for
him
and
less
cheer
of
meat
and
ale
but
for
all
young
life
he
has
a
passion
equal
to
a
so
he
laces
up
his
boots
and
does
not
grieve
see
him
in
the
dim
outlying
barn
with
the
sick
heifer
which
is
sure
to
die
the
wet
killed
several
in
the
open
field
this
one
is
to
die
on
dry
hay
she
lies
with
stiff
back
patient
and
motionless
except
that
her
ears
move
now
and
then
like
birds
they
alone
seem
alive
there
is
a
deep
blue
gleam
in
her
eyes
her
head
is
stretched
forward
upon
the
ground
she
is
alone
through
the
open
door
the
sunlight
falls
and
the
swallows
fly
in
and
out
or
hang
twittering
at
the
dark
beams
over
her
head
twice
a
day
the
cowman
comes
to
the
door
and
salutes
her
with
deep
slow
voice
hearty
and
blithe
cowslip
cowslip
he
pulls
away
the
foul
hay
from
under
her
and
puts
in
fresh
talking
now
in
a
high
falsetto
voice
as
to
a
child
he
raises
her
head
that
she
may
lap
the
bucket
of
gruel
still
talking
unintelligible
baby
talk
interlarded
with
her
pretty
name
she
holds
up
her
head
for
a
minute
or
two
heartened
by
her
moist
lips
and
full
stomach
and
that
voice
he
stands
in
the
doorway
watching
and
silent
now
as
her
head
slowly
sinks
down
and
she
sighs
while
her
limbs
find
their
position
of
least
pain
going
to
die
he
mutters
in
the
deep
voice
as
he
goes
a
very
different
earth
child
an
artist
used
to
live
in
a
cottage
at
the
foot
of
the
opposite
downs
the
village
itself
whether
you
saw
it
from
its
own
street
or
from
the
higher
land
was
wrought
into
such
a
rightness
of
form
as
few
other
artists
than
time
ever
achieve
it
made
a
music
to
which
the
hands
unconsciously
beat
time
but
though
apparently
complete
in
itself
it
was
as
part
of
a
huge
and
gentle
harmony
of
sky
down
and
forest
that
the
village
was
most
fascinating
like
all
beautiful
things
in
their
great
moments
the
whole
scene
was
symbolic
not
only
in
the
larger
sense
by
expressing
in
an
outward
and
visible
way
an
inward
grace
but
in
the
sense
that
it
gathered
up
into
itself
the
meanings
which
many
other
scenes
only
partly
and
in
a
scattered
way
expressed
two
roads
of
a
serpentining
form
that
was
perpetually
alluring
from
afar
climbed
the
down
from
the
village
and
skirting
the
forest
ended
in
the
white
mountains
of
the
moon
at
the
tail
of
one
of
these
roads
the
artist
lived
his
work
still
further
enlarged
the
harmony
of
sky
and
down
and
village
for
a
short
time
i
used
to
wonder
why
it
was
that
when
i
entered
his
studio
the
harmony
was
prolonged
into
something
even
more
huge
and
gentle
than
seemed
to
have
been
designed
how
came
it
that
he
could
safely
hang
his
pictures
on
the
wall
of
the
down
as
practically
they
were
hung
it
is
not
enough
to
say
merely
that
it
was
because
they
did
not
as
some
landscapes
seem
to
do
enter
into
competition
with
nature
the
spirit
that
raised
and
sculptured
the
downs
that
entered
the
beech
and
made
a
melody
of
its
silent
towering
and
branching
that
kept
the
sky
above
alive
and
beautiful
with
the
massiveness
of
mountains
and
the
evanescence
of
foam
was
also
in
this
fingers
he
was
a
great
lover
of
these
things
and
in
his
love
for
them
combined
the
ecstasy
of
courtship
with
the
understanding
of
marriage
but
he
loved
them
too
well
to
draw
and
paint
them
he
was
not
of
those
who
tear
themselves
from
a
mistress
to
write
a
sonnet
on
her
face
no
he
painted
the
images
which
they
implanted
such
was
their
love
of
him
and
his
of
them
in
his
brain
there
many
a
metamorphosis
as
wonderful
as
was
made
the
mingled
with
the
fantasies
of
the
brain
and
brought
forth
holes
that
are
almost
human
forms
branches
that
are
thoughts
and
roots
that
are
more
than
wood
often
i
think
he
hardly
looked
at
nature
as
he
walked
except
to
take
a
careless
pleasure
in
the
thymy
winds
in
the
drama
of
light
and
shade
on
the
woods
and
hills
in
the
sound
of
leaves
and
birds
and
water
within
him
these
things
lived
a
new
life
until
they
reached
forms
as
different
from
their
beginnings
as
we
are
from
palæolithic
man
they
attained
to
that
beauty
of
which
as
i
have
said
nature
was
so
little
jealous
by
this
evolution
some
of
his
pictures
of
the
of
beeches
always
remind
me
of
the
efflorescence
of
frost
on
a
and
the
comparison
is
not
purely
fantastic
but
has
a
real
significance
and
yet
the
landscapes
of
this
metamorphosis
are
not
as
might
have
been
expected
decorations
that
have
lost
all
smell
of
earth
and
light
of
sun
and
breath
of
breeze
decorative
they
certainly
are
and
i
know
few
pictures
which
are
less
open
to
the
accusation
of
being
scraps
from
nature
which
it
is
more
impossible
to
think
of
extending
beyond
the
limits
of
the
frame
but
such
is
the
personality
of
the
artist
that
all
this
refinement
only
made
more
powerful
than
ever
the
spirit
of
the
motionless
things
the
trees
the
pools
the
hills
the
clouds
frankly
there
is
a
deep
fund
of
what
must
narrowly
and
for
the
moment
only
be
called
inhumanity
in
the
artist
or
he
could
not
thus
have
reinforced
or
intensified
the
inhumanity
of
nature
consider
for
example
his
of
the
those
woods
are
untrodden
woods
as
lonely
as
the
sky
they
are
made
for
the
song
to
rule
in
solitude
under
the
crescent
moon
no
lovers
walk
there
mortal
who
enters
there
must
either
a
poet
or
a
madman
be
look
again
at
his
in
spain
how
it
is
perched
up
above
that
might
of
forest
like
a
child
that
has
climbed
whence
it
can
never
descend
and
the
little
house
at
the
edge
of
the
high
dark
wood
in
farm
under
the
is
as
frail
and
timid
as
if
it
heard
the
roaring
of
wild
beasts
and
the
little
white
road
winds
into
the
darkness
as
to
death
so
too
with
the
children
who
make
a
pretence
of
playing
hoops
at
the
edge
of
just
such
another
wood
though
mortal
has
never
come
out
of
it
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
the
ship
in
the
of
the
is
subdued
to
the
spirit
of
autumn
as
is
the
poet
subdued
to
the
immense
scenes
of
to
introduce
an
elvish
figure
as
he
has
done
in
the
was
an
unnecessary
aid
to
the
elvishness
of
the
scene
itself
indeed
his
human
or
fantastic
figures
seem
to
be
sometimes
as
much
out
of
place
as
a
yankee
at
the
court
of
king
arthur
though
there
are
two
notable
exceptions
and
weed
both
figures
towards
which
idolatry
might
be
excusable
so
nobly
do
they
represent
labour
in
the
field
and
even
in
weed
the
boy
seems
bemused
by
the
motion
and
savour
of
the
smoke
that
curdles
up
through
the
autumn
air
the
picture
of
a
forest
pool
is
magical
but
it
repudiates
the
fairy
altogether
nothing
would
be
more
out
of
place
here
than
the
kind
of
sucking
harlequin
or
columbine
which
is
commonly
foisted
upon
us
as
a
fairy
for
here
is
something
more
desirable
the
very
forces
which
begot
the
fairies
upon
a
different
age
from
ours
even
when
he
draws
a
house
it
is
i
think
for
the
sake
for
the
sake
of
whatever
soul
it
has
acquired
which
men
can
not
take
away
was
there
ever
such
an
inn
as
the
landlord
is
dead
the
casks
are

a

has
littered
on
the

with

a
life
of
its
own
the
two
figures
at

are
utterly
dwarfed
by
its
ancientness
its
space
and
the
infinite
silence
without
the
picture
in
which
there
is
most
humanity
is
that
of
a
high
wall
ruinous
and
overgrown
the
deep
gap
in
it
is
tragical
but
even
here
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
a
wall
that
was
raised
by
hand
of
mason
and
as
to
the
inhabitants
who
left
it
desolate
i
feel
more
doubtful
still
i
believe
it
was
built
in
a
dream
long
ago
lost
in
some
victory
gained
by
the
forest
over
men
and
quite
forgotten
until
this
artist
thought
it
would
be
a
happy
lair
for
a
faun
he
has
not
shown
us
the
faun
i
wish
he
had
he
ought
to
know
what
it
was
like
but
that
gap
is
its
gateway
out
from
the
forest
into
the
dew
of
the
river
lawns
it
induces
an
awful
sense
of
the
infinite
variety
of
human
character
to
think
of
the
love
of
earth
first
in
this
man
and
then
in
that

wonder
tolerance

of

like
precious
stones
the
rain
keeps
the
eyes
down
so
that
they
see
one
by
one
the
little
things
of
the
wayside
the
strings
of
the
and
of
the
scarlet
bryony
berries
the
stony
bark
of
the
young
ash
unveiled
by
the
moving
leaves
the
million
tall
straight
shoots
which
the
strong
nature
of
ash
and
hazel
has
soared
into
since
the
spring
then
follows
field
after
field
of
corn
of
sheep
among
hurdled
squares
of
mustard
in
flower
of
grass
interrupted
now
and
then
by
the
massed
laurels
and
rhododendrons
and
the
avenues
of
monkey
puzzles
that
announce
the
pleasure
grounds
of
the
rich
it
is
a
high
land
of
too
level
clay
chiefly
blest
in
that
it
beholds
the
downs
their
saddles
of
woodland
and
through
the
deepest
passes
the
sea
and
an
island
rising
out
of
it
like
an
iceberg
and
that
it
is
traversed
by
the
way
which
gathers
to
itself
and
marjoram
under
its
hazels
and
pours
cloudily
over
the
ash
and
brier
that
overhang
the
side
of
an
old
chalk
pit
long
straight
and
even
like
a
wall
just
here
are
many
grassy
lanes
between
hazel
and
blackthorn
hedges
an
old
farmhouse
with
ivied
chimneys
and
ten
blind
windows
in
front
stands
bereaved
with
weedy
garden
but
for
miles
the
air
sounds
with
poultry
and
the
building
of
bungalows
in
deal
and
iron
for
strangers
it
is
not
a
stranger
that
rides
by
i
think
his
fathers
must
have
been
in
this
land
when
wolf
hanger
was
not
a
strange
name
for
the
beeches
over
the
hill
he
is
a
tall
straight
man
with
long
narrow
face
clear
not
too
irregular
features
sallow
complexion
black
hair
and
black
drooping
moustache
and
flashing
eyes
as
dark
as
privet
berries
in
autumn
dews
now
it
is
a
woodland
country
of
broad
wooded
common
and
low
undulating
downs
crowned
or
fringed
by
woods
this
is
according
to
the
gypsies
houses
are
few
and
stand
either
well
off
the
road
or
with
scarcely
a
dividing
line
between
their
gardens
and
the
commons
from
which
they
have
been
filched
their
linen
and
red
flannel
flap
under
enormous
beeches
where
an
old
track
makes
its
way
betwixt
them
the
children
living
here
the
generations
of
them
who
have
been
bred
in
the
little
flint
house
are
children
of
the
woods
their
minds
half
made
by
the
majestic
but
dark
and
trees
that
stand
over
them
day
and
night
and
by
the
echoes
you
may
hear
them
summoning
the
echoes
at
evening
out
of
the
glades
and
see
them
pause
as
if
dazed
by
the
wild
reply
opposite
the
door
is
a
close
untrodden
tangle
of
brier
and
thorn
and
bramble
under
oaks
where
the
dead
leaves
of
many
autumns
lie
untouched
even
by
the
wind
so
dense
is
the
underwood
that
sighs
continually
in
the
topmost
boughs
at
the
edge
nettles
with
translucent
leaves
waver
and
nod
above
mossy
banks
not
far
off
is
a
woodland
farm
a
group
of
houses
and
barns
and
sheds
built
of
flint
and
wood
and
thatched
aloof
a
man
enters
one
of
the
cavernous
sheds
with
a
pail
a
thick
bent
knotty
man
with
bushy
dark
hair
and
beard
and
bright
black
eyes
a
farmer
the
son
of
one
who
rebuilt
the
house
when
the
woods
were
darker
and
huger
still
life
is
a
dark
simple
matter
for
him
of
his
living
is
done
for
him
by
the
dead
merely
to
look
at
him
is
to
see
a
man
live
generations
thick
so
to
speak
and
neither
nature
nor
the
trumpery
modern
man
can
easily
disturb
a
human
character
of
that
density
as
i
watch
him
going
to
and
fro
i
lose
sight
of
everything
away
from
his
rude
house
and
the
tall
woods
because
they
and
he
are
so
powerful
he
has
the
trees
as
well
as
his
ancestors
at
his
back
and
it
is
no
flight
of
fancy
to
see
him
actually
cut
off
from
all
the
world
except
the
house
and
woods
and
yet
holding
his
own
able
to
keep
his
fire
burning
his
larder
full
his
back
covered
and
his
house
dry
i
feel
but
a
wraith
as
i
pass
by
i
wonder
what
there
is
worth
knowing
that
he
does
not
know
with
his
bright
eyes
bright
long
teeth
stiff
limbs
capable
of
unceasing
toil
and
that
look
of
harmony
with
day
and
night
i
see
him
looking
on
as
the
wounded
trooper
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
a
trifle
ago
drains
the
water
just
lifted
from
the
well
look
at
his
gallant
face
his
delicate
ardour
as
of
another
race
bright
dress
restless
blue
eyes
his
helplessness
after
the
defeat
in
a
cavalry
fight
about
nothing
at
all
the
cornet
rides
away
and
the
woodland
fellow
puts
all
his
nature
into
the
felling
of
a
beech
as
into
an
object
worthy
of
cold
steel
and
as
he
plies
his
axe
he
smiles
at
the
thought
of
that
brave
that
silly
face
and
sleek
hair
he
smiles
as
he
sees
a
youth
go
by
with
proud
looks
of
command
incapable
as
he
well
understands
of
commanding
anything
except
perhaps
a
wife
or
a
groom
or
a
regiment
of
townsmen
yet
his
landlord
rough
grass
and
scattered
thorns
and
lofty
groups
of
beeches
lie
on
either
side
of
the
road
and
grassy
tracks
lead
to
thatched
cottages
in
the
woods
a
silver
sky
moves
overhead
along
the
road
the
telegraph
wires
go
humming
the
one
shrill
note
in
this
great
harmony
of
men
and
woods
and
sky
beyond
a
broad
champaign
of
corn
and
grey
grass
heaves
from
the
woodland
edge
the
road
is
gay
with
red
polished
fruit
and
equally
red
soft
leaves
with
darkest
purple
and
bronze
and
and
green
berries
and
leaves
and
beam
foliage
still
pure
green
and
white
so
high
now
are
the
unkempt
hedges
that
the
land
is
hid
and
only
the
sky
appears
above
the
coloured
trees
except
at
a
meeting
of
ways
when
a
triangular
patch
of
turf
is
sacred
to
burdock
ragwort
and
thistle
and
touching
the
dust
of
the
road
the
lowly
silverweed
an
oak
overhangs
yet
the
little
open
space
admits
a
vision
of
the
elephantine
downs
going
west
in
the
rain
in
a
moment
the
world
is
once
again
this
narrow
one
of
the
lane
where
i
see
and
touch
with
the
eye
and
enjoy
the
shapes
of
each
bole
and
branch
in
turn
their
shapes
their
many
colours
of
the
wood
itself
wrinkled
and
grooved
or
overlaid
by
pale
green
mould
silver
lichen
or
dark
green
moss
each
bend
in
the
road
is
different
at
one
all
the
leaves
are
yellow
but
the
bramble
the
hazel
the
elder
and
there
is
a
little
chalk
pit
below
fresh
white
and
overhung
by
yew
and
the
dark
purple
elder
berries
small
but
distinct
at
another
there
is
a
maple
of
exquisite
small
leaves
and
numerous
accordingly
a
tree
in
a
lovely
attitude
and
surmounted
by
a
plume
only
a
small
plume
of
in
county
they
call
it
suddenly
there
is
a
village
of
thatched
roofs
phlox
in
the
gardens
good
spaces
of
green
and
of
between
one
house
and
the
next
and
a
crystal
river
pervading
all
with
its
flash
and
sound
the
anvil
rings
and
the
fire
glows
in
the
black
smithy
the
timber
leans
outside
his
thatched
shed
against
an
ancient
elder
etherealized
by
lucent
yellow
leaves
before
the
inn
a
jolly
ostler
with
bow
legs
and
purple
neck
washes
the
wheels
of
a
cart
ever
and
anon
filling
his
pail
from
the
stream
and
swishing
the
bright
water
over
the
wheels
as
they
spin
a
decent
old
man
stands
and
watches
leaning
on
his
stick
held
almost
at
length
so
as
to
make
an
archway
underneath
which
a
spaniel
sprawls
in
the
sun
the
men
are
all
at
the
corn
and
he
does
not
know
what
to
do
can
he
read
asks
the
ostler
knowing
the
answer
very
well
no
we
all
read
now
chuckles
the
ostler
as
he
flings
a
pailful
over
the
wheel
the
old
man
is
proud
at
least
to
have
lived
into
such
a
notable
day
man
reads
now
almost
as
well
as
master
quite
as
well
they
used
to
be
dummies
the
working
class
people
yes
that
they
was
you
tell
what
will
happen
meantime
the
ostler
fills
his
pail
and
the
old
man
having
too
many
thoughts
to
say
any
more
lays
his
blackthorn
on
the
bench
and
calls
for
his
glass
of
fourpenny
ale
close
by
there
is
an
entrance
to
the
more
open
downs
the
uncut
hedges
are
so
thick
that
the
lane
seems
a
cutting
through
a
wood
and
soon
it
becomes
a
grassy
track
of
great
breadth
under
and
amidst
purple
dogwood
and
and
finally
it
is
a
long
broad
field
full
of
wild
carrot
and
scabious
through
which
many
paths
meander
side
by
side
until
the
last
gate
gives
a
view
under
oak
and
hazel
sprays
on
to
the
green
undulations
of
hill
and
coombe
their
sides
studded
with
juniper
and
thorn
with
something
of
oceanic
breadth
in
the
whole
as
far
as
the
utmost
bound
leagues
away
where
a
line
of
small
trees
stands
against
the
sky
in
the
manner
of
ships
the
hedges
in
this
downland
are
low
or
broken
a
few
ricks
stand
at
the
borders
of
stubble
and
grass
sheep
munch
together
in
square
pens
there
is
no
house
and
the
rain
has
wiped
out
everything
that
moved
save
its
own
perpendicular
fringes
waving
along
the
hills
this
solitude
of
grey
and
brown
is
completed
by
the
notice
on
a
frail
and
tottering
post
will
be
prosecuted
with
the
utmost
rigour
of
the
towards
the
farther
verge
compact
copses
of
beech
begin
to
saddle
the
ridges
and
invade
the
hollows
so
as
to
form
cliffy
dark
sides
to
the
friths
of
pale
stubble
or
turf
amongst
them
and
then
the
green
way
runs
into
a
roman
road
and
in
the
twilight
and
rain
i
can
see
many
other
narrow
ancient
tracks
winding
into
the
white
road
as
straight
as
a
sword
losing
themselves
in
it
like
children
in
a
mouth
the
turf
alongside
is
mounded
by
tumuli
and
against
the
hedge
a
gypsy
family
pretend
to
shelter
from
the
windy
rain
the
man
stands
moody
holding
the
pony
the
women
crouch
with
chins
upon
knees
the
children
laugh
and
will
not
be
still
they
belong
to
the
little
roads
that
are
dying
out
they
hate
the
shelterless
road
the
booming
cars
that
go
straight
to
the
city
in
the
vale
below
they
are
less
at
home
there
than
the
swallows
that
haunt
the
leeward
sides
of
the
sycamores
ever
rushing
up
towards
the
trees
and
ever
beaten
back
like
children
playing
the
king
of
the
castle
at
the
verge
of
the
city
there
by
the
inn
piano
soldiers
and
their
friends
and
women
sing
with
vague
pathos
songs
about
and
and
and
is
and
girls
while
the
streets
glitter
and
gurgle
with
rain
just
before
night
the
sky
clears
it
is
littered
with
small
dark
clouds
upon
rose
like
rocks
on
a
wild
and
solitary
coast
of
calm
and
it
is
infinitely
remote
and
infinitely
alluring
those
clouds
are
the
islands
of
the
blest
even
so
alluring
might
be
this
life
itself
this
world
if
i
were
out
of
it
for
a
moment
i
fancy
how
i
might
lean
and
watch
it
all
being
dead
for
a
moment
only
since
the
poverty
of
death
is
such
that
we
can
not
hope
from
it
such
a
gift
of
contemplation
from
afar
can
not
hope
even
that
once
out
of
the
world
we
may
turn
round
and
look
at
it
and
feel
that
we
are
not
of
it
any
more
nor
hope
that
we
shall
know
ourselves
to
be
dead
and
be
satisfied
rain
shrouds
the
islands
of
the
sky
the
singers
find
them
in
their
song
in
the
morning
the
ground
is
beautiful
with
blue
light
from
one
pane
of
sky
that
will
not
be
hidden
by
the
tumultuous
rain
outside
the
city
the
new
thatch
of
the
ricks
shines
pale
in
the
sodden
land
which
presently
gives
way
to
a
great
water
with
leaning
masts
and
a
majestic
shadowy
sweep
of
trees
down
to
the
flat
shore
to
level
green
marsh
and
bridges
crossing
the
streams
that
are
announced
by
ripples
in
the
sun
by
swishing
sedge
by
willows
blenching
beyond
is
forest
again
first
scattered
cottages
and
little
yellow
apples
beaming
pale
on
crooked
trees
then
solitudes
of
heather
and
bracken
traversed
and
lighted
by
blue
waters
ponds
and
streams
among
flats
of
rushes
and
beyond
at
either
hand
woods
on
low
and
high
land
endlessly
changing
from
brightness
to
gloom
under
windy
clouds
the
roads
are
yellow
and
oaks
and
beeches
hang
over
them
in
whispering
companies
the
wind
reigns
in
the
high
magnificent
onset
of
the
clouds
in
the
surging
trees
in
the
wings
of
rooks
and
daws
in
bowing
sedges
and
cotton
grass
in
quivering
heather
and
grass
in
rippling
water
in
wildly
flying
linen
yet
in
the
open
there
is
a
strange
silence
because
the
roar
in
my
ears
as
i
walk
deafens
me
to
all
sound
white
ponies
graze
by
dark
waters
and
stir
the
fragrance
of
the
bog
myrtle
the
rises
of
the
heathery
moor
are
scarred
yellow
where
the
gravel
is
exposed
sometimes
great
beeches
plated
with
green
lichen
and
grey
wave
their
stiffening
foliage
overhead
or
there
is
a
group
of
old
hollies
encircled
by
coeval
ivy
whose
embraces
make
them
one
and
both
seem
of
stone
sometimes
the
yellow
road
runs
among
heather
and
gorse
shadowed
by
pines
that
shake
and
plunge
in
the
wind
but
are
mute
a
white
fungus
shines
damp
in
the
purple
moor
there
are
a
myriad
berried
hawthorns
here
more
gorse
more
heather
and
bracken
the
tiny
pools
beneath
are
blown
into
ripples
like
a
swarming
of
bees
but
the
infuriate
streams
can
not
trouble
the
dark
water
and
broad
lily
leaves
in
their
bays
other
pools
again
are
tranquil
and
lucid
brown
over
submerged
moss
and
pennywort
and
fallen
leaves
worlds
to
themselves
with
a
spirit
indwelling
in
the
pure
element
presently
denser
trees
hold
back
the
wind
save
in
their
tempestuous
crests
and
now
the
road
is
carpeted
with
pine
needles
and
nothing
can
be
seen
or
felt
but
the
engulfing
sound
of
wind
and
rain
the
pines
are
interrupted
by
tall
bracken
hollies
and
thorns
by
necks
of
turf
and
isolated
hawthorns
thereon
and
far
away
the
light
after
rain
billows
grandly
over
the
mounded
forest
many
a
golden
stream
pours
through
the
dark
trees
oaks
succeed
closing
in
lichened
multitudes
about
a
ferny
road
but
suddenly
giving
way
to
beeches
pallid
and
huge
one
lies
prone
across
the
road
still
green
of
leaf
having
torn
up
a
mound
of
earth
and
bracken
and
bramble
as
large
as
a
house
in
its
upheaval
others
have
lost
great
branches
and
the
mossy
earth
is
ploughed
by
their
fall
they
seem
to
have
fought
in
the
night
and
to
be
slumbering
with
dreams
of
battle
to
come
and
their
titanic
passions
keep
far
away
the
influence
of
the
blue
sky
and
silver
clouds
that
laugh
out
unconcerned
after
the
rain
after
them
birches
and
birchlings
grow
out
of
the
heather
backed
by
a
solid
wall
of
oaks
and
again
there
are
many
beeches
over
mossy
golden
turf
and
one
tree
of
symmetrical
rounded
foliage
makes
a
circle
of
shade
where
nothing
grows
but
all
about
it
a
crowd
of
dwarf
brackens
twinkle
and
look
like
listeners
at
an
oracle
beyond
countless
pillars
of
dark
pines
tower
above
green
grass
then
the
road
forks
a
shapely
oak
still
holding
up
dead
arms
through
clouds
of
greenery
stands
at
one
side
at
the
other
a
green
road
wanders
away
under
beeches
in
stately
attitudes
and
at
ceremonious
distance
from
one
another
straight
ahead
open
low
meadows
surround
a
reedy
water
where
coot
and
moorhen
cry
to
each
other
among
willow
islets
and
the
reflex
of
a
bright
and
windy
heaven
and
yet
once
more
the
road
pierces
the
dense
woodland
roar
form
and
colour
buried
as
it
were
in
sound
except
where
a
space
of
smoothest
turf
expands
from
the
road
and
out
of
the
crimson
berries
of
an
old
thorn
comes
the
voice
of
a
robin
singing
persistently
and
past
that
inevitably
is
a
cottage
among
the
beeches
more
cottages
are
set
in
the
moorland
that
rolls
to
an
horizon
of
ridgy
oak
away
from
small
green
meadows
behind
the
cottages
these
give
way
to
treeless
undulations
like
gigantic
long
barrows
coloured
by
sand
by
burnt
gorse
and
by
bracken
farther
away
a
wooded
hump
all
dark
under
threatenings
of
storm
and
farthest
of
all
the
downs
serene
and
pale
the
plough
begins
to
invade
the
forest
the
undulations
sink
to
rest
in
a
land
of
corn
and
cloud
of
dark
green
levels
of
windy
whitened
abeles
and
a
shining
flood
gilded
by
a
lofty
western
sky
of
gold
and
grey
beside
the
darkling
waters
couches
an
old
town
with
many
windows
looking
under
thatch
and
tile
upon
grave
streets
ending
in
a
spread
of
the
river
where
great
horses
wading
lift
their
knees
high
as
they
splash
under
a
long
avenue
of
aspens
and
alarm
the
moorhens
beautiful
looks
the
running
river
under
the
hunting
of
the
clouds
and
the
few
bright
stars
and
beautiful
again
broad
blue
or
streaked
or
shadowy
or
glittering
or
beside
a
white
mill
or
company
of
willows
under
the
breezes
and
pearl
of
dawn
and
i
wish
there
were
a
form
for
saluting
a
new
gods
and
the
ignota
two
roads
go
northward
against
the
stream
the
main
road
straight
or
in
long
curves
on
one
side
of
the
river
the
other
on
the
opposite
bank
in
a
string
of
fragments
zigzagging
east
and
west
and
north
these
fragments
connect
houses
or
groups
of
houses
with
one
another
and
it
looks
as
if
only
by
accident
they
had
made
the
whole
which
now
connects
two
towns
their
chief
business
is
to
serve
the
wheels
and
feet
of
those
bound
upon
domestic
or
hamlet
but
not
urban
business
seen
upon
the
map
the
road
sets
out
straight
for
a
town
far
north
but
in
two
miles
the
hospitality
of
a
great
house
seems
to
draw
it
aside
then
of
emerging
again
it
wanders
awhile
before
returning
to
its
northward
line
and
this
it
does
time
after
time
and
as
often
as
it
pauses
a
lesser
road
runs
out
of
it
to
the
great
road
across
the
river
there
are
scores
of
such
parallel
roads
sometimes
the
lesser
is
in
part
or
entirely
a
footpath
in
england
and
in
avoiding
the
dust
the
smell
the
noise
the
insolence
of
the
new
traffic
the
lesser
are
an
invaluable
aid
this
one
proceeds
without
rise
or
fall
through
the
green
river
levels
but
looks
up
to
a
ridge
of
purple
moor
away
from
the
stream
with
oak
and
thatched
cottages
below
the
heather
it
creeps
in
and
out
like
an
old
cottage
woman
at
a
fair
and
sees
everything
it
sees
all
the
farms
and
barns
it
sees
the
portly
brick
house
and
its
gardens
bounded
by
high
fruit
walls
and
its
in
front
on
the
bank
of
a
golden
brook
that
sings
under
elms
and
sallows
the
long
white
windows
the
decent
white
porch
the
large
lawns
the
pond
and
its
waterfowl
sounding
in
the
reeds
the
oaks
and
acacias
the
horse
mowing
the
lawn
lazily
the
dogs
barking
behind
the
elizabethan
stables
it
sees
the
broad
grassy
borders
for
this
is
not
a
road
cut
by
a
skimping
tailor
and
the
woods
of
oak
and
ash
and
hazel
which
the
squirrel
owns
chiding
clucking
and
angrily
flirting
his
tail
at
those
who
would
like
to
share
his
nuts
at
every
crossing
road
these
grassy
borders
which
are
in
places
as
broad
as
meadows
so
that
cattle
graze
under
their
elms
spread
out
into
a
green
and
round
about
are
yellow
thatched
cottages
with
gardens
full
of
scarlet
bean
flowers
and
yellow
dahlias
and
a
pond
reflects
the
blue
and
white
sky
wagtails
flutter
at
the
edge
and
geese
launch
themselves
as
if
for
a
voyage
the
only
sound
upon
the
road
is
made
by
the
cart
carrying
a
fragrant
load
after
ten
miles
the
road
crosses
the
river
and
wanders
even
farther
from
the
highway
here
there
are
more
woods
of
hazel
and
oak
and
borders
where
sloe
and
blackberry
shine
polished
by
rain
among
herbage
of
yellow
ragwort
and
purple
knapweed
yellowing
leaves
the
gateways
show
steep
meadows
between
the
woods
one
shows
two
lovers
of
sixteen
years
old
gathering
nuts
in
the
warm
sun
the
silence
the
solitude
the
boy
bends
down
and
she
steps
quickly
and
carelessly
upon
his
back
to
reach
a
cluster
of
six
and
then
descending
looks
away
for
a
little
while
and
turns
her
left
cheek
to
him
softly
smiling
wordless
things
to
herself
so
that
her
lover
could
not
but
lean
forward
and
kiss
her
golden
skin
where
it
is
most
beautiful
beneath
her
ear
and
her
looped
black
hair
there
is
a
maid
whose
ways
are
so
wonderful
and
desirable
that
it
would
not
be
more
wonderful
and
desirable
if
helen
had
never
grown
old
and
demeter
had
kept
persephone
for
a
day
convolvulus
hides
all
the
nettles
of
life
of
all
the
delicate
passing
things
i
have
seen
and
heard
the
slow
languid
gracious
closing
and
unclosing
of
a
rounded
wings
as
it
chooses
a
clod
to
alight
on
the
sound
of
poplar
leaves
striving
with
the
sound
of
rain
in
a
windy
summer
shower
the
glow
of
elms
where
an
autumn
rainbow
sets
a
foot
amongst
them
the
first
fire
of
september
lighted
among
men
and
books
and
flowers
not
one
survives
to
compare
with
this
gateway
vision
of
a
moment
on
a
road
i
shall
never
travel
again
to
rescue
such
scenes
from
time
is
one
of
the
most
blessed
offices
of
books
and
it
is
a
book
that
i
remember
now
as
i
think
of
that
maiden
smiling
a
book
which
says
heifer
of
the
by
bain
and
i
could
tell
thee
stories
that
would
make
thee
laugh
at
all
thy
trouble
and
take
thee
to
a
land
of
which
thou
hast
never
dreamed
where
the
trees
have
ever
blossoms
and
are
noisy
with
the
humming
of
intoxicated
bees
where
by
day
the
suns
are
never
burning
and
by
night
the
ooze
with
nectar
in
the
rays
of
the
moon
where
the
blue
lakes
are
filled
with
rows
of
silver
swans
and
where
on
steps
of
the
peacocks
dance
in
agitation
at
the
murmur
of
the
thunder
in
the
hills
where
the
lightning
flashes
without
harming
to
light
the
way
to
women
stealing
in
the
darkness
to
meetings
with
their
lovers
and
the
rainbow
hangs
for
ever
like
an
opal
on
the
dark
blue
curtain
of
the
clouds
where
on
the
moonlit
roofs
of
crystal
palaces
pairs
of
lovers
laugh
at
the
reflection
of
each
lovesick
faces
in
goblets
of
red
wine
breathing
as
they
drink
air
heavy
with
the
fragrance
of
the
sandal
wafted
from
the
mountain
of
the
south
where
they
play
and
pelt
each
other
with
emeralds
and
rubies
fetched
at
the
churning
of
the
ocean
from
the
bottom
of
the
sea
where
rivers
whose
sands
are
always
golden
flow
slowly
past
long
lines
of
silent
cranes
that
hunt
for
silver
fishes
in
the
rushes
on
their
banks
where
men
are
true
and
maidens
love
for
ever
and
the
lotus
never
fades
the
great
old
books
do
the
same
a
hundred
times
take
arabian
for
example
they
are
full
of
persons
places
and
events
depicted
with
so
strong
an
appeal
to
our
eyes
and
to
that
part
of
our
intelligence
which
by
its
swiftness
and
simplicity
corresponds
to
our
eyes
that
no
conceivable
malversation
by
a
translator
can
matter
much
they
are
proof
against
it
just
as
our
tables
and
chairs
and
are
proof
against
the
man
who
tears
our
books
and
cracks
our
glass
cases
of
artificial
grapes
or
stuffed
kingfishers
when
we
move
to
a
new
house
this
group
of
women
is
beyond
the
reach
of
time
or
an
indifferent
style
ten
female
slaves
approached
with
a
graceful
and
conceited
gait
resembling
moons
dazzling
the
sight
and
confounding
the
imagination
they
stood
in
ranks
looking
like
the
damsels
of
paradise
and
after
them
came
ten
other
female
slaves
with
lutes
in
their
hands
and
other
instruments
of
diversion
and
mirth
and
they
saluted
the
two
guests
and
played
upon
the
lutes
and
sang
verses
and
every
one
of
them
was
a
temptation
to
the
servants
of
god
a
hundred
others
flock
to
my
mind
competing
for
mention
like
a
company
of
doves
for
a
mere
pinch
of
seed
sitting
at
a
lattice
to
watch
the
young
men
playing
at
ball
and
throwing
an
apple
to
ansal
wajoud
in
countenance
with
laughing
teeth
generous
or
that
same
girl
letting
herself
down
from
her
prison
and
escaping
over
the
desert
in
her
most
magnificent
apparel
and
a
necklace
of
jewels
on
her
neck
sindbad
returning
home
rich
from
every
voyage
and
as
often
in
the
midst
of
the
luxuries
of
his
rest
going
down
to
the
river
by
bagdad
and
seeing
a
fair
new
ship
and
embarking
for
the
sake
of
profit
and
of
beholding
the
countries
and
islands
of
the
world
these
clear
appeals
come
into
the
tales
like
white
statues
suddenly
carven
to
our
sight
among
green
branches
but
they
are
also
something
more
than
a
satisfaction
to
our
love
of
what
is
large
bright
coloured
in
high
relief
every
one
knows
how
at
a
passage
like
that
in
the
when
the
exiled
æneas
sees
upon
the
new
walls
of
the
remote
city
of
carthage
pictures
of
that
strife
about
troy
in
which
he
was
a
great
part
or
at
a
verse
in
a
ballad

it
was
in

how
the
cheek
flushes
and
the
heart
leaps
up
with
a
pleasure
which
the
incidents
themselves
hardly
justify
we
seem
to
recognize
in
them
symbols
or
images
of
ideas
which
are
important
to
mortal
minds
they
are
of
a
significance
beyond
allegories
they
are
as
powerful
and
usually
as
mysterious
in
their
power
as
the
landscape
at
sight
of
which
the
gazer
sighs
in
his
joy
he
knows
not
why
in
such
passages
the

of
the
finest

captured
by
a
gigantic
ethiopian
king
some
were
eaten
the
survivors
so
pleased
the
king
by
the
sweetness
of
their
voices
while
they
were
crying
and
lamenting
that
they
were
hung
up
in
cages
for
the
king

of

gave
to
his
daughter

when
the
youth
sat
thinking
of
the
happy
past
and
crying
over
it
she
was
overjoyed
at
the
singing
of
her
little
captive
perhaps
more
pleasing
still
is
the
door
in
the
grass
which
has
only
to
be
removed
to
discover
a
splendid
subterranean
palace
and
a
whose
aspect
banished
from
the
heart
all
anxiety
and
grief
and
affliction
even
when
the
finder
is
the
son
of
a
king
cutting
wood
in

forest
far
from
his
lost
home
and
from
those
who
know
him
as
the
son
of
a
king

appearances
of
the
great
caliph

scenes
of
the

class
a
young
man

with
his
mistress

the
sound
of

lovely
singing
draws
four
darwishes
to

for

some
one

noblest
of
all
perhaps
is
one
of
the
short
about
the
discovery
of
a
terrestrial
paradise
went
out
to
seek
a
straying
camel
and
chanced
upon
a
superb
and
city
lying
silent
in
the
desert
and
when
the
caliph
inquired
about
that
city
a
learned
man
told
him
that
it
was
built
by
sheddad
the
king
this
prince
was
fond
of
ancient
books
and
took
delight
in
nothing
so
much
as
in
descriptions
of
paradise
so
that
his
heart
enticed
him
to
make
one
like
it
on
the
earth
under
him
were
a
hundred
thousand
kings
and
under
each
of
them
were
a
hundred
thousand
soldiers
and
he
furnished
them
with
the
measurements
and
set
them
to
collect
the
materials
of
gold
and
silver
and
ruby
and
pearl
and
chrysolite
for
twenty
years
they
collected
then
he
sought
a
fit
place
among
rivers
on
a
vast
open
plain
in
twenty
years
they
built
the
city
and
finished
its
impregnable
fortifications
for
twenty
years
he
laboured
in
equipping
himself
his
viziers
his
harem
and
his
troops
for
the
occupation
of
this
paradise
then
when
he
was
rejoicing
on
his
way
sent
down
upon
him
and
upon
the
obstinate
infidels
who
accompanied
him
a
loud
cry
from
the
heaven
of
his
power
and
it
destroyed
them
all
by
the
vehemence
of
its
sound
neither
sheddad
nor
any
of
those
who
were
with
him
arrived
at
the
city
or
came
in
sight
of
it
and
god
obliterated
the
traces
of
the
road
that
led
to
it
but
the
city
remaineth
as
it
was
in
its
place
until
the
hour
of
the
beyond
the
gateway
the
downland
and
the
corn
begins
and
with
it

that

and
the
robin
sings
beside
far
away
white
rounds
of
cloud
bursting
with
sunlight
are
lifted
up
out
of
the
ground
born
of
earth
they
pause
a
little
upon
the
ridge
and
then
take
flight
into
the
blue
profound
their
trains
of
shadow
moving
over
the
corn
sheaves
over
the
ploughs
working
along
brown
bands
of
soil
the
furzy
spaces
the
deeply
cloven
grassy
undulations
the
lines
of
yews
and
of
slowly
a
spire
like
a
is
thrust
up
through
the
downs
into
the
sky
beyond
the
spire
a
huge
woody
mound
rises
up
from
the
low
flowing
land
huge
and
carved
all
round
by
an
entrenchment
as
if
by
the
weight
of
a
crown
that
it
had
worn
for
ages
certainly
it
wears
no
crown
not
a
human
being
lives
there
they
have
all
fled
to
the
riverside
and
the
spire
leaving
their
ancient
home
to
the
triumphs
of
the
to
the
play
of
children
on
the
sward
within
its
walls
and
to
the
archæologist
and
very
sad
and
very
noble
it
looks
at
night
when
it
and
the
surrounding
downs
lift
up
their
dark
domes
of
wood
among
the
mountains
of
the
sky
and
the
great
silence
hammers
upon
the
ears
then
a
hedgeless
road
traverses
without
interrupting
the
long
downs
one
after
another
lines
of
trees
thin
and
dark
and
old
come
out
against
the
pale
bright
sky
of
late
afternoon
and
file
away
beyond
the
green
turf
and
roots
and
the
grey
or
yellow
stubble
as
the
sun
sets
dull
crimson
at
the
foot
of
a
muslin
of
grey
and
gold
which
his
course
has
crimsoned
the
low
clouds
on
the
horizon
in
the
north
become
a
deathly
blue
white
belonging
neither
to
day
nor
to
night
while
overhead
the
cloudlets
are
touched
faintly
with
flame
now
the
glory
and
the
power
of
the
colour
in
the
west
and
now
the
pallid
north
fill
the
brain
to
overflowing
with
the
mingling
of
distance
of
sublime
motion
and
of
hue
and
intoxicate
it
and
give
it
wings
until
at
last
when
the
west
is
crossed
by
long
sloping
strata
as
of
lava
long
cooled
they
seem
the
bars
of
a
cage
impassable
but
even
they
are
at
last
worn
away
and
the
sky
is
as
nothing
compared
with
earth
for
there
as
i
move
the
infinite
greys
and
yellows
of
the
crops
the
grass
the
bare
earth
the
clumps
of
firs
the
lines
of
beeches
and
oaks
play
together
in
the
twilight
and
the
hills
meet
and
lose
their
lines
and
flow
into
one
another
and
build
up
beautiful
lines
anew
the
outward
and
visible
signs
of
a
great
thought
out
of
the
darkness
in
which
they
are
submerged
starts
a
crying
of
pewits
and
partridges
and
overhead
and
close
together
the
wild
duck
fly
west
into
the
cold
gilded
blue
at
dawn
a
shallow
crystal
river
runs
over
stones
and
waves
green
hair
past
ancient
walls
of
flint
tall
towers
and
many
windows
with
vines
about
the
mullions
past
desolate
grass
of
old
elmy
meads
and
umbrageous
roads
winding
white
by
carven
gateways
under
sycamore
and
elm
and
ash
and
many
alders
and
haughty
avenues
of
limes
past
an
old
great
church
past
a
park
where
elms
and
oaks
and
bushy
limes
hide
a
ruin
among
nettles
and
almost
hide
a
large
stone
house
from
which
peacocks
shout
past
a
white
farm
that
stands
with
a
village
of
its
own
thatched
barns
and
sheds
under
walnut
and
elm
enclosed
within
a
circuit
of
old
brick
with
a
tower
that
looks
along
the
waters
it
is
a
place
where
man
has
known
how
to
aid
his
own
stateliness
by
that
of
nature
the
trees
are
grand
and
innumerable
but
they
stand
about
in
aristocratic
ways
the
bright
young
water
does
not
flout
the
old
walls
but
takes
the
shadow
of
antiquity
from
them
and
lends
them
verdure
in
return
the
pebbles
under
the
waves
are
half
of
them
fallen
from
the
walls
the
curves
round
which
they
bend
are
of
masonry
so
that
it
is
unapparent
and
indifferent
whether
the
masonry
has
been
made
to
fit
the
stream
or
the
stream
persuaded
to
admit
the
masonry
as
i
look
i
think
of
it
as
statius
thought
of
the
surrentine
villa
when
he
prayed
that
earth
would
be
kind
to
it
and
not
throw
off
that
ennobling
yoke
everywhere
the
river
rushes
and
shines
or
roars
unseen
behind
trees
the
sun
is
warm
and
the
golden
light
hangs
as
if
it
were
fruit
among
the
leaves
over
the
ripples
above
the
stream
the
elms
open
apart
and
disclose
a
wandering
grey
land
and
clumps
of
beeches
a
grey
windy
land
and
a
grey
windy
sky
in
which
the
dark
clumps
are
islanded
flocks
of
sheep
move
to
and
fro
and
with
them
the
swallows
two
shepherds
their
heavy
grey
overcoats
slung
about
their
shoulders
and
the
sleeves
dangling
their
flat
rush
baskets
on
their
backs
stand
twenty
yards
apart
to
talk
leaning
on
their
sticks
while
their
flocks
go
more
slowly
and
their
two
dogs
converse
and
walk
round
one
another
the
oats
have
been
trampled
by
rain
and
two
men
are
reaping
it
by
hand
they
are
not
men
of
the
farm
but
rovers
who
take
their
chance
and
have
done
other
things
than
reaping
in
their
time
one
is
a
hampshire
man
but
fought
with
the
wiltshires
against
he
liked
the
boers
were
very
much
like
a
lot
of
working
men
we
never
beat
no
we
never
beat
he
is
a
man
of
heroic
build
tall
lean
rather
than
narrow
in
the
loins
with
goodly
calves
which
his
old
riding
breeches
perfectly
display
his
head
is
small
his
hair
short
and
crisp
and
fair
his
cheeks
and
neck
darkly
tanned
his
eye
bright
blue
and
his
features
strong
and
good
except
his
mouth
which
is
over
large
and
loose
very
ready
to
talk
which
he
does
continually
in
a
great
proud
male
voice
however
hard
he
is
working
a
man
as
lean
and
hard
and
bright
as
his
reaping
hook
first
he
snicks
off
a
dozen
straws
and
lays
them
on
the
ground
for
a
bond
then
he
slashes
fast
along
the
edge
of
the
corn
for
two
or
three
yards
gathers
up
what
is
cut
into
his
hook
and
lays
it
across
the
straws
when
a
dozen
sheaves
are
prepared
in
the
same
way
he
binds
them
with
the
bonds
and
builds
them
into
a
stook
of
two
rows
leaning
together
it
is
impossible
to
work
faster
and
harder
than
he
does
in
cutting
and
binding
only
at
the
end
of
each
dozen
sheaves
does
he
stand
at
his
full
height
straight
as
an
ash
and
laugh
and
round
off
what
he
has
been
saying
even
more
vigorously
than
he
began
it
then
crouching
again
he
slays
twelve
other
sheaves
then
he
goes
over
to
the
cask
in
the
hedge
it
is
a
that
he
likes
and
he
pays
for
it
himself
in
his
walk
and
attitude
and
talk
except
in
his
accent
there
is
little
of
the
countryman
he
is
a
citizen
of
the
world
without
wife
or
home
or
any
tie
except
to
toil
and
after
that
pleasure
and
toil
again
a
loose
bold
liver
and
lover
there
can
be
no
doubt
the
spirit
of
life
is
strong
in
him
in
limbs
and
chest
and
eyes
and
brain
the
spirit
which
compels
one
man
to
paint
a
picture
one
to
sacrifice
his
life
for
another
one
to
endure
poverty
for
an
idea
another
to
commit
a
murder
what
is
there
for
him
to
be
the
mark
for
a
bullet
to
contract
a
ravenous
disease
to
bend
slowly
under
the
increasing
pile
of
years
of
work
of
pleasures
he
does
not
care
he
is
always
seeing
bit
of
from
town
to
town
from
county
to
county
a
peerless
fleshly
man
casting
himself
away
as
carelessly
as
nature
cast
him
forth
into
the
world
his
father
before
him
was
the
same
ploughboy
circus
rider
brickmaker
and
day
labourer
again
on
the
land
one
who
always
for
a
policeman
when
he
had
had
a
he
set
out
on
his
travels
again
and
disappeared
his
wife
went
another
way
and
she
is
still
to
be
met
with
in
the
summer
weather
not
looking
as
if
she
had
ever
borne
such
a
son
as
this
reaper
as
she
grows
older
she
seems
to
stretch
out
a
connecting
hand
to
generations
to
the
men
and
women
who
raised
the
huge
earthen
walls
of
the
camps
on
these
hills
she
has
a
trembling
small
face
wrinkled
and
yellow
like
old
newspaper
above
a
windy
bunch
of
rags
chiefly
black
rags
a
welshwoman
who
has
been
in
england
fifty
years
she
remembers
or
thinks
of
chiefly
those
welsh
years
when
as
a
girl
she
rode
a
pony
into
neath
market
she
hums
a
welsh
tune
and
still
laughs
at
it
because
she
heard
it
first
in
those
days
from
one
then
poor
and
old
and
abject
she
herself
tall
and
wilful
and
the
words
of
it
were
my
dear
boy
get
she
would
like
once
again
to
lie
in
her
warm
bed
and
hear
the
steady
rain
falling
in
the
black
night
upon
the
mountain
she
feels
the
sharp
flint
against
the
sole
of
her
foot
and
appears
not
to
be
annoyed
or
indignant
or
resolved
to
be
rid
of
the
pain
but
only
puzzled
by
the
flintiness
of
god
as
she
travels
in
the
long
pageant
of
those
who
go
on
living
the
lonely
downland
road
among
the
gorse
and
the
foxgloves
in
the
hot
but
still
misty
morning
when
the
grey
and
the
chestnut
horses
patient
and
huge
and
shining
among
the
sheaves
wait
for
the
reaping
machine
to
be
uncovered
and
the
work
to
begin
through
the
grey
land
goes
a
narrow
and
flat
vale
of
grass
and
of
thatched
cottages
the
river
winds
among
willows
and
makes
a
green
world
out
of
which
the
downs
rise
suddenly
with
their
wheat
here
stands
a
farm
with
dormers
in
its
high
yellow
roof
and
a
square
of
beeches
round
about
there
a
village
even
its
walls
thatched
flutters
white
linen
and
blue
smoke
against
a
huge
chalk
scoop
in
the
downs
behind
for
miles
only
the
clusters
of
the
break
through
the
rain
and
the
gently
changing
grey
of
the
cornland
and
green
of
the
valley
until
several
farms
of
thatched
brick
gather
together
under
elms
and
mellowing
chestnuts
and
make
a
crooked
hamlet
or
at
a
bend
in
the
road
a
barn
like
a
diminutive
down
stands
among
ricks
and
under
elms
behind
is
a
red
farm
and
church
tower
embowered
in
front
the
threshing
machine
booms
and
smokes
and
an
old
drenched
woman
stands
bent
aloft
receiving
the
sheaves
in
her
blue
stiff
claws
close
by
a
man
leads
a
horse
away
from
a
field
and
its
companion
looks
over
the
gate
with
longing
and
turns
away
and
again
returning
almost
jumps
it
but
failing
through
fearfulness
at
seeing
the
other
so
near
the
bend
in
the
road
races
down
the
hedge
and
back
and
stands
listening
to
the
whinny
and
then
scattering
the
turf
dashes
into
an
orchard
beyond
and
whinnies
as
he
gallops
in
majesty
rigid
and
black
the
steam
ploughs
are
working
up
against
the
treeless
sky
and
just
seen
in
the
rain
the
white
horse
carved
upon
the
hill
seems
a
living
thing
but
of
mist
now
as
if
for
the
sake
of
the
evening
bells
and
the
gleaners
the
rain
withholds
itself
and
over
the
drenching
stubble
the
women
and
children
in
black
and
grey
and
dirty
white
crawl
doubled
up
careless
of
the
bells
and
of
the
soft
moist
gold
of
the
sun
that
envelops
them
as
of
the
rain
and
wind
that
after
a
little
while
cover
up
the
gold
upon
the
field
and
the
green
and
rose
of
the
sky
and
so
to
the
inn
why
do
not
inns
have
a
regular
tariff
for
the
poorish
man
without
a
let
bleed
the
rich
by
all
means
but
why
should
they
charge
me
one
shilling
and
ninepence
for
a
cod
steak
or
a
chop
or
the
uneatable
cold
roast
beef
of
new
england
and
then
charge
the
same
sum
for
the
best
part
of
a
duckling
and
cheese
and
a
pint
of
ale
i
once
asked
the
most
enterprising
publisher
in
london
whether
he
would
print
a
book
that
should
tell
the
sober
truth
about
some
of
our
english
inns
and
he
said
that
he
dared
not
do
anything
so
horrible
for
fear
of
ruining
my
publisher
i
will
not
mention
names
but
simply
say
that
at
nine
inns
out
of
ten
the
charges
are
incalculable
and
excessive
unless
the
traveller
makes
a
point
of
asking
beforehand
what
they
are
going
to
be
a
course
that
provokes
discomfort
in
his
relation
to
the
host
outweighing
what
is
saved
the
tea
room
on
the
other
hand
is
inexpensive
it
lies
behind
a
shop
and
there
is
a
adjacent
even
now
the
butcher
can
be
heard
parting
the
warm
hide
from
the
flesh
inside
the
room
is
green
and
the
little
light
and
the
rain
also
come
sickly
through
windows
of
stained
glass
and
fall
upon
a
piano
a
bicycle
an
embroidered
deck
chair
vases
of
dead
grass
on
a
table
a
screen
pasted
over
with
scraps

scene
a

their

upon

dictated
by

have
the
world
to
myself
a
world
of
frenzied
rain
among

of

an

of

up

desolate
among

and

about

yellow

and

standing
aloof

is
some
way
from
the
downs
themselves
but
just
at
the
foot
of
a
lesser
slope
a
fair
golden
hill
golden
with
cowslips
in
may
that
rises
on
one
side
with
a
swift
short
ascent
and
then
shoots
forward
as
if
with
the
impetus
almost
level
until
after
crowning
itself
with
beeches
it
descends
in
a
lazy
curve
to
a
field
roughened
by
the
foundations
of
a
vanished
house
at
one
corner
of
which
the
chimneys
join
with
another
group
of
elms
in
the
haze

rain
hanging
from
the

in
rags

wet

the
remains

announcement
of

at

behind
mahogany
oak

certain
ounces
of
silver
two
thousand
books
portraits

landscapes
and

of
horses
and

of
all

how
much
else
has
the
red
house
been
disembowelled
it
is
all
shadowy
within
behind
the
windows
like
the
eyes
of
a
corpse
and
without
sound
or
form
or
light
and
it
is
for
no
one
that
the
creeper
magnificently
arrays
itself
in
bediamonded
crimson
and
gold
that
throbs
and
wavers
in
the
downpour
the
martins
are
still
there
and
their
play
up
and
down
before
the
twenty
windows
is
a
senseless
thing
like
the
play
of
children
outside
a
chamber
of
agony
or
grief
they
seem
to
be
machines
going
on
and
on
when
their
master
and
purpose
are
dead
but
then
too
there
is
gradually
a
consolation
a
restfulness
a
deceit
a
forgetting
in
the
continuity
of
their
movement
and
their
unchanged
voices
the
two
hundred
autumns
perpetuated
in
the
tones
of
the
bricks
are
in
vain
strangers
will
come
no
doubt
i
hope
they
will
not
and
be
pleased
actually
proud
at
this
mellowness
which
ought
to
have
died
with
the
last
of
the
family
that
built
the
house
the
tall
throw
down
their
fruit
out
of
the
crisp
rusty
foliage
and
it
rolls
darkly
burnished
out
of
the
pods
white
as
mushrooms
in
the
rain
and
where
it
falls
it
lies
and
no
child
gathers
it
and
the
harvest
waggons
have
crushed
a
thousand
under
their
wheels
the
moss
is
beginning
to
encrust
the
gravel
for
the
soft
feet
of
the
ghosts
of
the
old
men
and
the
mothers
and
the
maids
and
the
and
tottering
babes
that
have
trodden
it
once
now
that
they
are
all
gone
every
one
they
seem
always
to
have
been
ghosts
with
loud
happy
voices
and
wails
of
sorrow
with
smiles
dark
looks
passionate
splendours
bright
hair
the
bright
brown
hair
as
of
red
deer
in
the
men
the
long
heavy
coils
of
living
odorous
gold
in
the
women
but
flitting
to
and
fro
footless
unconfined
like
the
swallows
returning
and
wandering
up
and
down
as
if
they
had
left
something
behind
in
their
home
when
i
first
entered
the
house
by
an
accident
in
passing
that
way
a
a
granddaughter
and
her
son
were
alone
in
the
house
with
two
servants
the
mother
early
widowed
had
come
with
her
child
to
minister
to
the
last
days
of
the
ancient
man
the
house
was
by
then
full
of
the
reports
of
death
in
almost
every
room
there
had
been
a
deathbed
for
it
had
always
been
full
of
life
there
was
never
such
a
house
for
calling
back
its
children
the
sons
of
it
brought
their
wives
and
the
daughters
their
husbands
and
often
an
excuse
was
made
for
one
pair
to
stay
on
indefinitely
and
thus
it
came
to
be
full
also
of
death
this
granddaughter
however
had
stayed
as
she
wished
to
believe
against
her
will
because
the
old
man
was
so
fond
of
his
she
was
a
beautiful
strong
woman
with
the
dark
lustrous
skin
gold
hair
perfect
clear
features
proud
step
and
prouder
voice
of
all
the
family
she
had
shone
before
a
thousand
eyes
and
yet
she
stayed
on
and
on
obsessed
by
the
multitudinous
memories
of
the
house
alone
under
the
downs
her
grandfather
would
talk
of
nothing
but
his
father
and
his
grandfather
the
lawyers
the
captains
the
scholars
whose
bones
were
under
the
churchyard
elms
and
his
sons
and
their
sons
all
of
them
also
now
dead
he
had
their
childish
ways
by
heart
the
childish
ways
of
men
who
were
at
his
birth
as
well
as
of
those
who
went
but
yesterday
into
the
grave
and
all
their
names
their
stately
their
names
and
those
which
recorded
the
maiden
names
of
their
mothers
their
nicknames
too
a
whole
book
of
them
the
legends
about
the
most
conspicuous
their
memorable
speeches
and
acts
down
to
the
names
of
their
very
dolls
and
their
legends
also
which
of
course
recurred
again
and
again
in
the
family
fantasy
every
tree
and
field
and
gate
and
room
was
connected
with
some
one
of
the
dear
and
beauteous
or
brave
dead
with
their
birth
their
deeds
their
ends
the
portraits
of
many
of
them
at
least
one
to
every
generation
hung
on
the
walls
and
it
was
curious
to
notice
what
never
any
one
of
them
could
see
except
the
granddaughter
the
progress
and
the
decline
from
generation
to
generation
the
earliest
of
all
had
sailed
and
buccaneered
with
henry
morgan
a
great
lover
and
destroyer
of
life
it
was
from
him
that
the
expression
and
air
of
them
all
had
descended
love
and
battle
had
carved
his
face
out
from
behind
his
bold
but
easy
face
peered
a
prophetic
pitifulness
just
as
behind
the
loaded
brown
clouds
of
drifting
storm
peers
the
innocence
of
blue
and
upon
it
white
clouds
that
are
thin
and
waved
like
an
hair
upon
this
model
his
faces
had
been
carved
not
by
love
and
battle
but
by
his
might
alone
even
the
tender
women
flaunted
it
it
nestled
an
eagle
among
the
old
snows
it
possessed
the
little
child
and
he
had
nothing
but
the
face
of
the
buccaneer
like
an
eaglet
in
a
cage
a
house
is
a
perdurable
garment
giving
and
taking
of
life
if
it
only
fit
straightway
it
begins
to
chronicle
our
days
it
beholds
our
sorrows
and
our
joys
its
walls
know
all
our
thoughts
and
if
it
be
such
a
house
as
grows
after
the
builders
are
gone
our
thoughts
presently
owe
much
to
it
we
have
but
to
glance
at
a
certain
shadow
or
a
curve
in
the
pattern
to
recall
them
softened
as
by
an
echo
and
that
corner
or
that
gable
starts
many
a
fancy
that
reaches
beyond
the
stars
many
a
fancy
gay
or
enriched
with
regrets
it
is
aware
of
birth
marriage
and
death
and
who
dares
say
that
there
is
not
kneaded
into
the
stones
a
record
more
pleasing
than
brass
with
what
meanings
the
vesperal
beam
slips
through
a
staircase
window
in
autumn
the
moon
has
an
expression
proper
to
us
alone
nested
among
our
limes
or
heaving
an
ivory
shoulder
above
the
neighbour
roofs
as
we
enter
a
room
in
our
house
we
are
conscious
of
a
fitness
in
its
configuration
that
defies
mathematics
rightly
used
such
a
space
will
inspire
a
stately
ordering
of
our
lives
it
is
in
another
respect
the
amplest
canvas
for
the
art
of
life
it
becomes
so
much
a
part
of
us
that
we
exclaim
beautiful
house
in
sand
and
stone
what
will
it
be
in
heaven
this
beautiful
house
under
the
downs
was
already
more
than
and
it
was
a
giant
very
gentle
but
very
powerful
and
adding
to
its
power
the
lore
of
the
family
it
was
irresistible
this
young
mother
had
all
the
lore
by
heart
and
loved
it
yet
had
fought
against
it
she
had
been
happy
when
her
child
had
grown
at
first
unlike
her
own
family
and
much
like
her
but
no
his
hair
grew
lighter
his
nose
was
as
those
of
her
in
bud
and
now
that
he
was
five
he
was
not
a
child
so
much
as
an
incarnation
of
the
family
a
sort
of
graven
image
to
which
the
old
man
bowed
down
and
with
all
the
more
fervour
because
of
that
weakness
in
the
boy
which
others
thought
imbecility
the
old
man
too
had
been
not
only
a
man
but
a
family
now
that
the
child
was
there
he
waited
garrulously
contented
for
his
release
from
the
post
so
contented
was
he
that
when
the
granddaughter
left
her
child
with
him
and
after
delays
and
excuses
and
delays
disappeared
into
the
blank
indifferent
abyss
of
the
multitude
far
away
who
knew
not
the
house
and
the
family
he
was
not
only
contented
but
glad
at
heart
for
it
was
a
rebel
that
was
gone
for
several
years
the
white
beard
and
the
poor
child
lived
together
happily
turning
over
old
memories
old
books
old
toys
taking
the
old
walks
through
the
long
garden
past
but
not
into
the
beech
wood
that
a
whim
of
the
old
had
closed
against
even
himself
against
all
save
the
birds
and
the
squirrels
over
the
high
downs
and
back
into
the
deep
vale
which
had
produced
that
delicate
physical
beauty
and
those
gracious
lusty
ways
beyond
which
it
seemed
that
men
and
women
could
hardly
go
in
earthly
life
very
happy
were
those
two
and
very
placid
but
within
a
week
their
tragic
peace
was
perfected
the
boy
fell
out
of
one
of
the
and
was
killed
the
old
man
could
not
but
stumble
over
that
small
grave
into
his
own
and
here
is
the
end
the
unnoted
the
common
end
and
the
epitaph
written
by
the
auctioneer
and
the
rain
much
as
i
love
rain
heavy
or
light
freakish
or
continuous
i
am
glad
to
be
out
of
it
for
a
little
while
and
to
open
a
book
of
ballads
by
a
solitary
fire
at
white
horse
and
soon
to
close
it
after
reading
again
the
lines
then
bespake
her
daughter
dear
she
was
baith
jimp
and
row
me
in
a
pair
sheets
and
tow
me
owre
the
they
her
in
a
pair
sheets
and
her
owre
the
but
on
the
point
spear
she
gat
a
deadly
o
bonnie
bonnie
was
her
mouth
and
cherry
were
her
cheeks
and
clear
clear
was
her
yellow
hair
whereon
the
red
blood
dreeps
then
his
spear
he
her
owre
o
gin
her
face
was
wan
he
said
are
the
first
that
i
alive
he
and
lookit
again
at
her
o
gin
her
skin
was
white
might
hae
spared
that
bonnie
face
to
hae
been
some
delight
and
boon
my
merry
men
for
ill
dooms
i
do
guess
i
can
not
look
on
that
bonnie
face
as
it
lies
on
the
looks
to
freits
my
master
dear
its
freits
will
follow
them
let
it
be
said
that
edom
gordon
was
daunted
by
a
dame
i
can
not
help
wondering
whether
the
great
work
done
in
the
last
century
and
a
half
towards
the
recovery
of
old
ballads
in
their
integrity
will
have
any
effect
beyond
the
entertainment
of
a
few
scientific
men
and
lovers
of
what
is
ancient
now
that
the
first
effects
upon
wordsworth
and
his
contemporaries
have
died
away
can
it
possibly
give
a
vigorous
impulse
to
a
new
school
of
poetry
that
shall
treat
the
life
of
our
time
and
what
in
past
times
has
most
meaning
for
us
as
freshly
as
those
ballads
did
the
life
of
their
time
it
is
possible
and
it
is
surely
impossible
that
such
examples
of
simple
realistic
narrative
shall
be
quite
in
vain
certainly
the
more
they
are
read
the
more
they
will
be
respected
and
not
only
because
they
often
deal
with
heroic
matters
heroically
but
because
their
style
is
commonly
so
beautiful
their
pathos
so
natural
their
observation
of
life
so
fresh
so
fond
of
particular
detail
its
very
lists
of
names
being
at
times
real
poetry
sometimes
the
style
is
equal
and
like
to
that
of
the
most
accomplished
poetry
as
in
the
stanza
ynglyshe
men
let
ther
boys
bows
be
and
pulde
owt
brandes
that
were
brighte
it
was
a
hevy
syght
to
se
bryght
swordes
on
basnites
or
in
send
the
land
deliverance
frae
every
reaving
riding
scot
sune
hae
neither
cow
nor
ewe
sune
hae
neither
staig
nor
it
is
equally
good
in
passages
where
the
poet
simply
expresses
his
hearty
delight
in
something
which
his
own
eyes
have
seen
among
his
neighbours
as
in
had
horse
and
harness
for
them
all
goodly
steeds
were
all
o
the
golden
bands
an
about
their
necks
and
their
weapons
they
were
all
alike
and
by
the
way
do
not
touches
like
these
often
reveal
the
stamp
of
individuals
upon
pieces
which
are
loosely
said
to
have
been
by
the
they
quite
do
away
with
the
notion
that
ballads
were
composed
by
a
number
of
people
after
the
fashion
of
a
story
in
the
game
of
in
fact
it
is
one
of
the
pleasures
of
reading
ballads
to
watch
for
those
things
which
show
us
the
heart
of
one
man
who
stands
out
by
himself
such
a
one
was
the
man
who
said
dreamt
i
the
heather
green
my
true
love
on
and
who
was
that
unhappy
one
who
served
a
king
for
seven
years
and
only
once
saw
the
daughter
and
that
was
through
a
two
were
putting
on
her
gown
two
putting
on
her
shoes
five
were
combing
down
her
hair
neck
and
breast
was
like
the
snow
then
from
the
bore
i
was
forced
to
was
he
the
man
who
made
it
a
common
thing
to
speak
in
ballads
of
her
yellow
what
a
poet
too
was
he
who
put
that
touch
into
and
grahame
where
the
father
throws
down
his
glove
as
a
challenge
to
his
son
and
the
son
stoops
to
pick
it
up
and
says
father
put
on
your
glove
again
the
wind
hath
blown
it
from
your
it
is
one
of
the
most
delicate
things
and
with
it
the
stanza
in
the
same
ballad
where
the
father
praises
the
son
for
his
victory
over
a
friend
but
the
son
hating
the
battle
which
would
not
have
been
fought
if
the
fathers
had
not
quarrelled
in
their
wine
says
could
ye
not
drink
your
wine
at
home
and
letten
me
and
my
brother
be
and
the
mind
of
a
poet
is
to
be
seen
in
the
whole
of
some
ballads
and
in
every
detail
as
for
example
in
the
three
perfect
verses
lang
lang
may
their
ladies
sit
their
fans
into
their
hand
or
ere
they
see
sir
patrick
spens
come
sailing
to
the
land
o
lang
lang
may
the
ladies
stand
their
gold
combs
in
their
hair
wailing
for
their
ain
dear
lords
for
see
them
na
mair
to
aberdour
fiftie
fadom
deep
and
there
lies
guid
sir
patrick
spens
the
scots
lords
at
his
this
ballad
is
one
peculiar
to
our
island
and
no
one
can
seriously
deny
that
some
one
of
its
authors
was
one
of
the
greatest
writers
of
narrative
poetry
that
ever
lived
chapter
xv
an
outcast
wiltshire
not
far
from
white
is
a
little
town
upon
a
stream
that
waves
myriads
of
reeds
and
tall
purple
flowers
of
hemp
agrimony
these
are
the
last
shops
i
am
likely
to
pass
in
wiltshire
and
it
occurs
to
me
that
i
should
like
to
taste
lardy
cakes
which
i
last
bought
in
wroughton
fifteen
years
ago
before
i
leave
the
county
richard
grandfather
was
lord
lardy
in
old
swindon
sixty
years
ago
and
his
memory
is
kept
alive
by
those
tough
sweet
slabs
of
larded
pastry
which
in
his
generous
ovens
gathered
all
the
best
essences
of
the
other
cakes
pies
tarts
and
joints
which
were
permitted
to
be
baked
with
them
in
at
the
they
are
mentioned
with
some
indignity
as
a
delicacy
my
lips
water
for
them
and
at
the
first
bakery
in
i
ask
for
some
the
baker
tells
me
he
has
sold
the
last
one
he
is
a
small
and
man
with
an
expression
of
unctuous
repose
assuredly
a
pillar
of
his
chapel
and
possibly
its
treasurer
and
though
he
himself
will
by
his
own
telling
have
no
more
lardy
cakes
until
the
next
morning
he
stiffly
tries
to
persuade
me
that
none
of
his
bakes
them
i
disbelieve
the
man
of
dough
for
all
his
conscious
look
of
sagacity
and
virtue
and
am
rewarded
for
my
disbelief
by
four
lardy
cakes
for
not
many
yards
from
his
accursed
threshold
lardy
cakes
i
now
discover
for
the
first
time
have
this
merit
besides
their
excellent
taste
and
provision
of
much
pleasant
but
not
finical
labour
for
the
teeth
that
one
is
enough
at
a
time
and
that
four
will
therefore
take
a
man
quite
a
long
way
upon
the
roads
of
england
at
the
next
inn
three
labourers
and
the
landlord
are
heated
in
conversation
about
some
one
not
present
right
says
one
a
sober
carter
whose
whip
leans
against
the
counter
the
third
time
this
week
that
a
tramp
has
been
to
his
door
and
by
the
looks
of
them
they
call
for
of
them
i
know
says
the
landlord
came
in
here
once
and
asked
for
a
job
and
left
without
a
drink
but
after
been
to
cottage
he
came
straight
here
and
ordered
a
pint
of
mild
and
i
heard
as
he
let
a
chap
and
a
woman
sleep
two
nights
running
in
that
rough
patch
behind
the
house
you
think
the
parson
ought
to
hear
of
that
and
what
does
he
do
for
a
living
he
looks
poor
enough
know
jones
is
a
fellow
he
stopped
my
youngest
in
the
street
the
other
day
and

a

caution
with
a
man
who
is
selling
spectacles
at
a

a

and
i
mind
letting
any
one
know
it
very
glad
to
see
him
settled
down
the
only
one
along
the
road
who
gone
to
the

show

the
tall
man
calls
for
another
tankard
which
as
he
is
doing
all
the
talking
he
does
not
pass
to
the
small
neat
woman
behind
him
pleased
to
be
civilly
used
and
warmed
by
the
liquor
he
tells
the
story
of
his
friend
the
little
woman
helping
him
out
and
landlord
and
labourers
adding
some
touches
and
jones
himself
completed
the
picture
during
my
few
days
in
the
village
the
man
who
fed
his
dog
and
sent
the
beggar
satisfied
away
and
made
presents
to
the
children
and
lived
on
six
ounces
of
tobacco
a
week
is
a
native
of
zennor
in
cornwall
place
for
pedlars
is
cornwall
the
towns
are
so
few
and
far
between
that
the
people
along
the
road
used
to
pedlars
and
when
you
do
call
you
are
sure
of
the
best
of
he
was
apprenticed
to
a
shoemaker
in
a
town
in
south
devon
and
for
a
time
practised
his
trade
there
as
an
assistant
he
was
very
clever
at
boxing
and
wrestling
and
a
hard
fighter
too
though
unwilling
to
make
a
quarrel
but
he
was
a
queer
youth
and
took
violent
likes
and
dislikes
to
men
and
one
day
he
dropped
a
boot
and
went
out
into
the
street
and
took
a
young
gentleman
by
the
arm
and
said
to
him
me
sir
you
have
passed
this
shop
for
five
years
nearly
every
day
and
i
stand
it
any
whereupon
he
gave
that
young
gentleman
a
beating
he
was
sent
to
prison
he
lost
his
employment
and
went
to
sea
and
at
sea
or
else
in
foreign
countries
he
stayed
six
years
he
left
the
sea
only
because
he
broke
an
arm
which
had
at
length
to
be
amputated
above
the
elbow
he
was
a
changed
man
and
many
thought
then
that
he
was
mad
when
he
left
the
hospital
it
was
december
and
bitter
weather
he
had
only
five
shillings
and
it
was
notorious
how
he
spent
it
every
day
for
a
week
he
bought
three
loaves
of
bread
and
went
out
and
fed
the
birds
with
them
when
that
week
was
over
he
had
to
go
into
the
workhouse
and
there
he
stayed
until
the
spring
it
was
there
that
he
fell
in
with
the
tall
man
who
helped
to
tell
his
tale
they
left
together
and
for
some
time
he
almost
kept
the
two
by
begging
his
lack
of
an
arm
ensuring
his
success
but
he
was
not
altogether
to
his
taste
nevertheless
he
would
stop
and
smoke
a
pipe
and
admire
the
view
when
he
was
miles
from
anywhere
and
their
object
was
to
reach
a
town
and
find
enough
money
to
pay
for
lodgings
he
would
stand
by
a
hedge
content
for
an
hour
to
disentangle
the
bryony
strands
that
were
in
danger
of
straying
to
the
road
and
to
restore
them
to
the
hazel
and
thorn
where
their
fellows
ramped
he
was
willing
to
be
to
half
the
helpless
fledglings
that
he
found
on
the
roadside
sleeping
one
night
in
a
barn
he
could
not
be
persuaded
to
leave
until
he
had
decided
whether
it
was
better
to
kill
a
spider
who
had
a
great
appetite
for
flies
or
to
leave
it
to
fate
several
he
rescued
from
the
web
and
then
out
of
pity
for
the
spider
brought
it
flies
already
dead
but
finding
that
these
were
not
to
its
taste
he
left
the
difficulty
unsolved
and
went
sadly
on
his
way
almost
equal
to
his
pitifulness
was
his
dislike
of
work
and
his
moral
cowardice
nothing
could
persuade
him
to
do
any
work
and
such
a
coward
was
he
that
if
he
failed
at
the
first
house
where
he
offered
his
laces
for
sale
he
would
not
try
again
in
that
village
or
town
yet
he
did
not
scruple
to
steal
even
with
a
hint
of
physical
violence
if
he
needed
anything
which
chance
presented
to
him
in
another
possession
but
he
stole
only
necessaries
having
none
of
the
acquisitiveness
which
is
more
common
in
their
victims
than
in
thieves
few
men
use
leisure
as
well
as
he
perhaps
no
man
was
ever
idle
with
less
harm
to
his
fellows
the
rich
could
have
learned
many
lessons
at
his
feet
they
must
always
be
shooting
or
driving
furiously
or
meddling
with
politics
or
stopping
footpaths
they
can
not
be
kept
out
of
harm
however
rich
how
well
this
man
would
have
employed
money
he
would
have
given
it
away
by
and
by
his
pity
for
goaded
cattle
and
his
frequent
gazings
into
their
brown
eyes
as
they
stared
at
him
by
a
stile
still
further
reduced
his
necessities
he
would
touch
no
meat
so
that
his
companion
finding
him
no
longer
of
much
use
in
spite
of
his
possession
of
but
one
arm
left
him
and
only
crossed
his
path
at
increasing
intervals
of
time
it
was
now
that
jones
remembered
with
horror
a
scene
which
had
slumbered
in
his
mind
with
the
fear
which
it
originally
roused
in
youth
he
and
other
boys
were
in
the
habit
of
peeping
through
a
hole
in
the
wall
of
a
and
watching
the
slaughter
the
skinning
and
the
cutting
up
until
their
ears
became
familiar
with
the
groans
the
screams
the
gurglings
the
squelchings
in
the
of
the
blood
and
white
faces
and
the
knife
but
one
day
there
was
led
into
the
a
white
heifer
fresh
from
the
may
pasture
clean
and
bright
from
her
gleaming
rosy
hoofs
to
the
tips
of
the
horns
that
swayed
as
she
walked
her
breath
made
as
it
were
a
sacred
space
about
her
as
the
light
of
a
human
face
will
do
she
stood
quiet
but
uncertain
and
musingly
in
the
dark
soaked
place
into
which
light
only
came
in
bars
through
a
cobwebbed
lattice
and
fell
that
day
upon
her
white
face
leaving
in
darkness
the
tall
butcher
and
the
imbecile
assistant
who
held
the
rope
by
which
the
head
was
drawn
down
to
the
right
level
for
a
blow
the
men
were
in
no
hurry
and
as
the
heifer
was
not
restive
they
finished
their
talk
about
home
rule
then
the
idiot
tried
to
put
her
into
the
right
position
but
for
a
time
could
not
get
her
to
see
that
her
head
must
be
drawn
tight
and
somewhat
askew
against
the
oaken
pillar
he
only
succeeded
by
patting
her
flanks
and
saying
gently
as
if
to
a
girl
along
daisy
she
lowed
soft
and
bowed
her
head
the
blow
fell
she
rolled
to
the
ground
and
the
butcher
once
more
let
loose
the
heavy
scent
of
blood
the
wholesome
pretty
beast
the
familiar
along
daisy
and
the
blow
and
the
scent
came
often
into
mind
he
ate
no
meat
but
made
no
attempt
to
proselytize
he
simply
retreated
deeper
and
deeper
into
his
childlike
love
of
nature
the
birds
and
the
flowers
and
the
creeping
and
running
things
he
seemed
to
regard
as
little
happy
charming
undeveloped
human
beings
looking
down
on
them
with
infinite
tenderness
and
a
little
amusement
with
them
alone
was
he
quite
at
home
nature
as
she
presented
herself
to
his
simple
senses
was
but
a
fragrant
exuberant
chiefly
joyous
community
with
which
most
men
were
not
in
harmony
silent
for
days
and
thinking
only
under
the
branches
of
the
wood
he
came
to
demand
unconsciously
that
there
should
be
such
a
harmony
but
he
loved
nature
also
because
she
had
no
ambiguity
told
no
lies
uttered
no
irony
sitting
among
flowers
by
running
water
he
wore
an
expression
of
blessed
satisfaction
with
his
company
which
is
not
often
seen
at
the
friendliest
table
he
drew
no
philosophy
from
nature
no
opinions
ideas
proposals
for
reform
but
only
the
wisdom
to
live
happily
and
healthily
and
simply
himself
i
dare
say
modernity
was
in
his
blood
but
no
man
seemed
to
belong
less
to
our
time
of
history
and
science
he
knew
nothing
of
literature
nothing
he
had
to
make
out
the
earth
with
his
own
eyes
and
heart
he
had
not
words
for
it
but
he
felt
that
whatever
he
touched
was
god
no
myth
or
religion
had
any
value
to
him
there
were
no
symbols
for
him
to
use
the
deities
he
surmised
or
smelt
or
tasted
in
the
air
or
upon
the
earth
had
neither
name
nor
shape
had
he
been
able
to
think
he
was
the
man
to
put
our
generation
on
the
way
to
a
new
mythology
for
all
i
know
he
had
the
vision
the
power
of
the
seer
without
the
power
of
the
prophet
a
little
more
and
perhaps
he
would
have
invaded
christendom
as
paul
invaded
heathendom
yet
i
think
he
was
not
wholly
the
loser
by
being
unable
to
think
the
eye
untroubled
by
thought
sees
things
like
a
mirror
newly
burnished
at
night
for
example
the
musing
man
can
see
nothing
before
him
but
a
mist
but
if
he
stops
thinking
quickly
the
roads
the
walls
the
trees
become
visible
so
this
man
saw
with
a
clearness
as
of
angelico
and
in
his
memory
violets
and
roses
trees
and
faces
were
as
clear
as
if
within
his
brain
were
another
sun
to
light
them
he
had
but
to
close
his
eyes
to
see
these
things
an
innumerable
procession
of
days
and
their
flowers
and
their
birds
in
the
sky
or
on
the
bough
and
this
he
had
at
no
cost
he
employed
only
such
labour
as
was
needed
to
make
his
bread
and
occasionally
clothes
and
a
pipe
nor
did
he
merely
ask
alms
of
nature
and
civilization
he
paid
back
countless
charities
to
flower
and
bird
and
child
and
poorer
men
and
there
was
nothing
against
him
of
pain
or
sorrow
or
death
inflicted
and
as
he
was
without
religion
so
he
was
without
patriotism
he
had
no
country
knew
nothing
of
men
and
events
asked
by
a
person
who
saw
him
idle
and
did
not
observe
his
defect
whether
he
would
not
like
to
do
something
for
his
country
he
replied
have
no
country
like
you
sir
i
own
nothing
my
people
never
did
that
i
know
i
admire
those
that
do
for
i
have
been
in
many

country
when
i
was
a
sailor
but
never
a
one
to
beat
england
let
alone
the
west
country
when
haymaking
he
continued
to
beg
with
a
free
conscience
and
was
always
willing
to
give
away
all
that
he
had
to
one
in
more
need
and
now
chance
found
him
out
and
gave
him
ten
shillings
a
week
he
rented
a
cottage
in
this
village
weeded
his
but
let
his
turn
into
sometimes
he
wearied
of
his
monotonous
meals
he
would
then
fast
for
a
day
or
two
giving
his
food
to
the
birds
and
mice
until
his
hearty
appetite
returned
he
did
not
stay
long
in
the
village
he
was
shy
and
suspicious
of
men
and
except
by
the
younger
children
he
was
not
liked
he
set
out
on
his
travels
again
and
is
still
on
the
road
or
unlike
most
tramps
on
the
paths
and
green
lanes
the
simplest
kindest
and
perhaps
the
wisest
of
men
indifferent
to
mobs
to
laws
to
all
of
us
who
are
led
aside
scattered
and
confused
by
hollow
goods
one
whom
the
last
day
of
his
full
life
will
not
find
in
a
whirlpool
of
affairs

is
the
value
of
every
right
to
use
a
footpath
if
a

exclusive
landowning
citizen
has
the

to
make
it
intolerable
except
to
such
as
consider
it
a
place
only
for
the
soles
of
the

the

acquires
the

through

can
not
the

acquire
a
right
during
the
course
of
dynasties
or
less
to
the
sight
of
the

the

which
that
footpath
gives
them
in
its
own
separate
way
at

i
hope
that
footpaths
will
soon
cease
to
be
defined
as
a
line
length
without
breadth
connecting
one
point
with
another
in
days
when
they
are
used
as
much
for
the
sake
of
the
scenes
historic

beautiful
through
which
they
pass
as
of

on
this

that
something
more
than
the
mere
right
to
tread
upon
a
certain
ribbon
of
grass
or
mud
will
have
to
be
preserved
if
the
preservation
is
to
be
of
much
use
and
the
right
of
way
must
become
the
right
of
view
and
of
very
ancient
lights
as
well
by
enforcing
these
rights
some
of
the
mountains
of
the
land
might
even
yet
be
saved
as
henry
salt
wishes
to
save
them
in
the
meantime
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
his
criticisms
will
not
be
ignored
by
the
tourists
who
leave
the
needle
gully
a
cascade
of
luncheon
wrappings
and
the
like
for
it
is
not
from
a
body
of
men
capable
of
such
manners
that
a
really
effective
appeal
against
the
sacrifice
of
to
commercial
and
other
selfishness
is
like
to
spring
see
his
valuable
cambrian
and
cumbrian
fifield
and
those
lone
wayside
greens
no
gardens
measuring
a
few
feet
wide
but
many
miles
in
length
why
should
they
be
used
either
as
receptacles
for
the
dust
of
or
as
additions
to
the
property
of
the
landowner
who
happens
to
be
renewing
his
fence
they
used
to
be
as
beautiful
and
cool
and
fresh
as
rivers
these
green
sisters
of
the
white
roads
illuminated
borders
of
many
a
weary
tale
but
now
lest
there
should
be
no
room
for
the
dust
they
are
turning
away
from
them
the
gypsies
who
used
to
camp
there
for
a
night
the
indolent
district
council
that
is
anxious
to
get
rid
of
its
difficulties
for
the
moment
at
the
expense
of
a
neighbouring
district
it
cares
not
will
send
out
its
policemen
to
drive
away
the
weary
horses
and
sleeping
children
from
the
acre
of
common
land
which
had
hitherto
been
sacred
to
what
to
an
altar
a
statue
a
fountain
a
seat
no
to
a
stately
ago
the
common
of
which
this
is
a
useless
patch
passed
on
easy
terms
to
the
pheasant
lords
the
gypsies
have
to
go
give
them
a
pitch
for
the
night
and
you
are
regarded
as
an
enemy
of
the
community
or
perhaps
even
as
a
socialist
the
gypsies
shall
be
driven
from
parish
to
parish
and
finally
settle
down
as
squalid
degenerate
nomads
in
a
town
where
they
lose
what
beauty
and
courage
they
had
in
adding
to
the
difficulties
of
another
council
yet
if
they
were
in
a
cage
or
a
compound
which
it
cost
money
to
see
hundreds
would
pay
for
a
stare
at
their
brown
faces
and
bright
eyes
their
hooped
tents
their
horses
their
carelessness
of
the
crowd
and
in
a
few
years
an
imitation
of
these
things
will
be
applauded
in
a
of
the
town
which
has
destroyed
the
reality
the
grassy
way
ends
with
the
moor
at
a
pool
beside
a
road
on
one
side
of
it
six
thatched
cottages
fenced
by
sycamore
and
ash
and
elm
on
the
other
a
grey
farm
and
immense
brown
barn
within
a
long
wall
roofed
with
mossy
thatch
and
the
swallows
fly
low
and
slowly
about
the
trees
first
beeches
line
the
rising
and
descending
road
past
a
church
whose
ivied
tombstones
commemorate
men
of
cornish
name
as
far
as
an
inn
and
a
sycamore
nobly
balanced
upon
a
pedestal
of
matted
roots
then
there
are
on
either
side
and
ricks
of
straw
wetted
to
an
orange
hue
and
beyond
them
the
open
cornland
and
rising
out
of
it
an
procession
in
the
south
the
great
company
of
the
downs
again
some
tipped
with
wood
some
bare
in
the
north
a
broken
chain
of
woods
upon
low
but
undulating
land
seem
the
vertebræ
of
a
forest
of
old
time
stretching
from
east
to
west
like
the
downs
hither
and
thither
the
drunken
pewits
cry
over
the
furrows
and
thousands
of
rocks
and
daws
wheel
over
the
stubble
as
the
day
grows
old
it
grows
sweet
and
golden
and
the
rain
ceases
and
the
beauty
of
the
downs
in
the
humid
clearness
does
not
long
allow
the
eyes
to
wander
away
from
them
at
first
when
the
sun
breaks
through
all
silver
bright
and
acclaimed
by
miles
of
clouds
in
his
own
livery
the
downs
below
are
violet
and
have
no
form
except
where
they
carve
the
sky
with
their
long
arches
it
is
the
woods
northward
that
are
chiefly
glorified
by
the
light
and
warmth
and
the
glades
penetrating
them
and
the
shining
stubble
and
the
hedges
and
the
flying
and
the
cows
of
richest
brown
and
milky
white
the
road
also
gleams
blue
and
wet
but
as
the
sun
descends
the
light
falls
on
the
downs
out
of
a
bright
cave
in
the
gloomy
forest
of
sky
and
their
flanks
are
olive
and
their
outlines
intensely
clear
from
one
summit
to
another
runs
a
string
of
trees
like
cavalry
connecting
one
beech
clump
with
another
so
that
they
seem
actually
to
be
moving
and
adding
themselves
to
the
clumps
above
all
is
the
abstract
beauty
of
pure
line
coupled
with
the
beauty
of
the
serene
and
the
uninhabited
and
remote
that
holds
the
eye
until
at
length
the
hills
are
humbled
and
dispread
as
part
of
the
ceremony
of
sunset
in
a
tranquil
ensanguined
quietly
travelling
sky
the
blue
swallows
go
slowly
along
the
silent
road
beside
me
and
the
last
rays
bless
a
grooved
common
grazed
upon
by
cows
and
surrounded
by
ranges
of
low
white
buildings
and
a
row
of
lichened
grotesque
limes
dark
of
bole
where
children
are
playing
and
an
anvil
rings
frost
follows
after
the
blue
silence
and
chill
of
twilight
and
the
dawn
is
dimmest
violet
in
a
haze
that
reveals
the
candied
grass
the
soaking
blue
dark
elms
painted
yellow
only
in
one
place
the
red
roofs
all
in
a
world
of
the
unborn
and
the
waters
steaming
around
invisible
crying
coots
gradually
round
white
clouds
so
dim
that
the
sky
seems
but
to
dream
of
round
white
clouds
appear
imbedded
in
the
haze
the
beams
grow
hot
and
a
breeze
joins
with
them
in
sucking
and
scattering
all
the
sweet
of
the
first
fallen
leaves
the
weed
fires
and
the
late
honeysuckle
why
are
there
no
swifts
to
race
and
scream
we
fret
over
these
stages
of
the
descending
year
we
dream
on
such
a
day
as
this
that
there
is
no
need
of
farther
descent
we
would
preserve
those
days
of
the
reaping
we
have
lost
them
but
we
recall
them
now
when
the
has
furrowed
the
sheeny
stubble
and
long
for
the
day
when
the
gentle
north
wind
can
only
just
stir
the
clusters
of
and
the
branches
are
motionless
the
nut
bushes
hang
dreamily
heavily
over
the
white
cool
roads
the
is
the
sole
voice
in
the
oak
woods
of
the
low
hills
except
that
once
or
twice
a
swift
screams
as
he
pursues
that
martial
flight
of
his
as
of
one
who
swings
a
sword
as
he
goes
towards
the
beeches
and
hop
gardens
of
the
higher
hills
in
the
north
it
is
perhaps
the
last
day
for
more
than
eight
months
that
his
cry
will
be
heard
a
few
hang
from
the
hazels
some
leaves
are
yellow
autumn
in
fact
seems
possible
to
the
mind
that
is
not
perfectly
content
with
these
calm
sweet
airs
and
the
sense
of
the
fulness
of
things
at
a
crossing
a
small
island
is
made
amidst
this
and
three
other
roads
and
on
the
island
stands
an
oast
house
with
two
mellow
cones
and
white
leaning
cowls
and
beside
it
a
simple
tiled
dimly
displaying
massive
wheels
curving
bulwarks
of
waggons
and
straight
shafts
behind
its
doorless
pillars
of
wood
making
one
group
with
these
though
separated
from
them
by
one
road
is
an
old
red
farmhouse
of
barely
distinguishable
timber
and
brick
with
dormers
and
lower
windows
and
doors
entrenched
behind
hollyhocks
of
deepest
red
and
the
burning
discs
of
everlasting
sunflowers
behind
the
gates
stand
four
haystacks
brightly
thatched
and
one
that
is
dark
and
old
and
carved
into
huge
stairs
notice
the
gate
into
the
rickyard
it
is
of
the
usual
five
oak
bars
and
across
these
is
a
diagonal
bar
from
the
lowest
end
nearest
the
hinge
to
the
upper
end
of
the
opposite
side
and
from
top
to
bottom
a
perpendicular
divides
the
gate
the
top
bar
marks
it
as
no
common
gate
made
at
a
factory
with
a
hundred
others
of
the
same
kind
though
there
are
scores
of
them
in
kent
it
thickens
gradually
towards
the
hinge
end
of
the
gate
and
then
much
more
decidedly
so
that
it
resembles
a
and
stock
and
just
where
the
stock
begins
it
is
carved
with
something
like
a
the
whole
being
well
proportioned
graceful
but
strong
in
all
the
best
gates
of
kent
sussex
and
surrey
and
the
south
country
there
is
an
approach
to
this
form
usually
without
the
but
sometimes
having
instead
a
much
more
elaborate
variation
of
it
which
takes
away
from
the
dignity
and
simplicity
of
the
gate
at
the
edge
crooked
lean
over
a
green
pond
and
green
but
nearly
yellow
straight
reeds
and
four
three
sorrels
and
a
grey
are
grouped
under
one
stately
walnut
these
things
mingle
their
power
with
that
of
the
silence
and
the
wooded
distance
under
the
blue
and
rosy
west
the
slow
dying
of
a
roar
beats
upon
the
shores
of
the
silence
and
the
distance
and
is
swallowed
up
in
them
like
foam
in
sand
and
adds
one
more
trophy
to
the
glory
of
the
twilight
night
passes
and
the
white
dawn
is
poured
out
over
the
dew
from
the
folds
in
low
clouds
of
infinitely
modulated
grey
autumn
is
clearly
hiding
somewhere
in
the
long
warm
alleys
under
the
green
and
gold
of
the
hops
the
very
colours
of
the
oast
houses
seem
to
wait
for
certain
harmonies
with
oaks
in
the
meadows
and
beeches
in
the
steep
woods
the
songs
too
are
those
of
the
drowsy
of
the
robin
moodily
brooding
in
orchards
yellow
spotted
and
streaked
of
the
unseen
wandering
singing
sweetly
but
in
a
broken
voice
of
a
matter
now
forgotten
of
the
melancholy
twit
of
the
single
bullfinch
as
he
flies
the
sudden
lyric
of
the
wren
can
stir
no
corresponding
energy
in
the
land
which
is
bowed
still
comfortable
like
a
cow
fastened
to
the
and
munching
grains
soon
will
the
milk
and
honey
flow
the
whirrs
the
wheelwrights
have
mended
the
wheels
and
patched
their
sides
they
stand
outside
their
lodges
there
is
a
quarter
of
a
sloping
reaped
the
shocks
stand
out
above
the
silvery
stubble
in
the
evening
like
rocks
out
of
a
moonlight
sea
the
unreaped
corn
is
like
a
tawny
coast
and
all
is
calm
with
the
quiet
of
evening
heavens
fallen
over
the
earth
this
beauty
of
the
ripe
demeter
standing
in
the
august
land
is
incomparable
it
reminds
one
of
the
poet
who
said
that
he
had
seen
a
maid
who
looked
like
a
fountain
on
a
green
lawn
when
the
south
wind
blows
in
june
and
one
whose
smile
was
as
memorable
as
the
new
moon
in
the
first
still
mild
evening
of
the
year
when
it
is
seen
for
a
moment
only
over
the
dark
hills
and
one
whose
walking
was
more
kindling
to
the
blood
than
good
ale
by
a
winter
fire
on
an
endless
evening
among
friends
but
that
now
he
has
met
another
and
when
he
is
with
her
or
thinks
of
her
he
becomes
as
one
that
is
blind
and
deaf
to
all
other
things
but
a
few
days
and
the
bryony
leaves
are
palest
yellow
in
the
hedge
rooks
are
innumerable
about
the
land
but
their
cawing
like
all
other
sounds
like
all
the
early
bronze
and
rose
and
gold
of
the
leaves
is
muffled
by
the
mist
which
endures
right
through
the
afternoon
and
all
day
falls
the
gentle
rain
in
the
hillside
hop
garden
two
long
lines
of
women
and
children
red
and
white
and
black
are
destroying
the
golden
green
of
the
hops
and
they
are
like
two
caterpillars
destroying
a
leaf
pleasant
it
is
now
to
see
the
white
smoke
from
the
oast
house
pouring
solidly
like
curving
plumes
into
the
still
rain
and
to
smell
the
smell
bitter
and
never
to
be
too
much
sniffed
and
enjoyed
that
travels
wide
over
the
fields
for
the
hop
drier
has
lit
his
two
fires
of
welsh
coal
and
brimstone
and
charcoal
under
the
two
cones
of
the
oast
house
and
has
spread
his
couch
of
straw
on
the
floor
where
he
can
sleep
his
many
little
sleeps
in
the
busy
day
and
night
the
oast
house
consists
of
the
pair
of
cones
and
tiled
upon
their
two
circular
chambers
in
which
the
fires
are
lit
attached
to
these
on
one
side
is
a
brick
building
of
two
large
rooms
one
upon
the
ground
where
the
hop
drier
sleeps
and
tends
his
fires
lighted
only
by
doors
at
either
side
and
divided
by
the
wooden
pillars
which
support
the
floor
of
the
upper
room
this
the
oast
chamber
reached
by
a
ladder
is
a
beautiful
room
its
oak
boards
polished
by
careful
use
and
now
stained
faintly
by
the
of
hops
its
roof
raftered
and
high
and
dim
light
falls
upon
it
on
one
side
from
two
low
windows
on
the
opposite
side
from
a
door
through
which
the
hops
arrive
from
the
garden
the
waggon
waits
below
the
door
full
of
the
loose
stained
which
the
carter
and
his
boy
lift
up
to
the
drier
from
the
floor
two
short
ladders
lead
to
the
doors
in
the
cones
where
the
hops
are
suspended
on
canvas
floors
above
the
kilns
the
inside
of
the
cone
is
full
of
coiling
fumes
which
have
killed
the
young
swallows
in
the
nests
under
the
cowl
the
parents
return
again
and
again
but
dare
no
longer
alight
on
their
old
perches
on
the
vanes
when
dried
the
hops
are
poured
out
on
the
floor
of
the
vast
chamber
in
a
lisping
scaly
pile
and
the
drier
is
continually
sweeping
back
those
which
are
scattered
through
a
hole
in
the
floor
he
forces
them
down
into
a
sack
reaching
to
the
floor
of
the
room
below
he
is
hard
at
work
making
these
sacks
or
which
when
full
and
their
necks
stitched
up
are
as
hard
as
wood
before
the
drying
is
over
the
full
sacks
will
take
up
half
the
room
the
children
tired
of
picking
come
to
admire
and
to
visit
all
the
corners
of
the
room
of
the
granary
alongside
and
its
old
sheepbells
its
traps
a
crossbow
and
the
like
of
the
farmyard
and
barns
sacred
except
at
this
time
for
a
few
minutes
the
sun
is
visible
as
a
shapeless
crimson
thing
above
the
mist
and
behind
the
elms
it
is
twilight
the
wheels
and
hoofs
of
the
last
waggon
approach
and
arrive
and
die
away
and
so
day
after
day
the
fires
glow
with
ruby
and
sapphire
and
emerald
the
cone
wears
its
plume
of
smoke
and
everything
is
the
very
scent
of
the
drying
hops
can
hardly
be
otherwise
described
in
its
mixture
of
sharpness
and
mellowness
then
when
the
last
sack
is
pressed
benches
are
placed
round
the
chamber
and
a
table
at
one
end
the
master

hampshire
is
fair
day
the
scene
is
a
green
slightly
undulating
common
grassy
and
rushy
at
its
lower
end
where
a
large
pond
wets
the
margin
of
the
high
road
and
at
the
upper
end
sprinkled
with
the
dwarf
and
the
common
gorse
out
of
which
rise
many
tumuli
green
or
furzy
mounds
of
earth
often
surmounted
by
a
few
funereal
pines
the
common
is
small
it
is
bounded
on
every
side
by
roads
and
on
one
by
a
row
of
new
mean
houses
there
is
a
among
the
tumuli
in
one
place
a
large
square
has
been
ploughed
and
fenced
by
a
private
owner
but
the
slope
of
the
sandy
soil
is
pleasant
in
one
place
it
is
broken
into
a
low
cliff
overhanging
the
water
and
this
with
the
presence
of
the
gorse
give
it
a
touch
of
the
wildness
by
which
it
may
still
deserve
its
name
of
most
powerful
of
all
in
their
effect
upon
the
place
are
the
tumuli
they
are
low
and
smooth
one
or
two
scarcely
heave
the
turf
some
have
been
removed
and
there
is
no
legend
attached
to
them
yet
their
presence
gives
an
indescribable
charm
and
state
and
melancholy
too
and
makes
these
few
acres
an
expanse
unequalled
by
any
other
of
the
same
size
not
too
far
off
to
be
said
to
belong
to
the
heath
from
which
they
are
separated
by
three
miles
of
cultivated
land
and
a
lesser
beechen
hill
are
the
downs
among
them
one
that
bears
a
thin
white
road
winding
up
at
the
edge
of
a
dark
wood
in
the
moist
october
air
the
downs
are
very
grave
and
gentle
and
near
and
are
not
lost
to
sight
until
far
beyond
the
turreted
promontory
of
chanctonbury
early
in
the
morning
the
beggars
begin
to
arrive
the

and
the
blind
with

without
a
musical
instrument
king
of
them
all
certainly
is
he
with
no
legs
at
all
and
seeming
not
to
need
them
so
active
is
he
on
a
plank
which
suspends
him
only
a
foot
above
the
ground
many
a
strong
man
earns
less
money
the
children
envy
him
as
he
moves
along
a
wheeled
animal
with
neat
black
hat
and
white
slop
a
living
toy
but
with
a
deep
voice
a
concertina
and
a
tin
full
of
pence
and
halfpence
these
unashamed
curiosities
line
the
chief
approaches
down
which
every
one
is
going
to
the
fair
except
a
few
shabby
fellows
who
offer
blue
sheets
full
of
ballads
to
the
multitude
and
with
a
whisper
indecent
songs
to
the
select
another
not
less
energetic
but
stout
and
condescending
in
a
high
hard
felt
hat
gives
away
tracts
the
sound
of
a
hymn
from
one
organ
mingles
with
the
sound
of
me
among
the
from
another
and
the
rattle
of
the
legless
the
main
part
of
the
fair
consists
of
a
double
row
a
grove
of
tents
and
booths
roundabouts
caravans
traps
and
tethered
ponies
a
crowd
of
women
goes
up
and
down
between
the
rows
there
is
a
sound
of
music
of
firing
at
targets
of
shouts
and
neighs
and
brays
and
the
hoot
of
engines
here
at
the
entrance
to
the
grove
is
a
group
of
yellow
vans
some
children
playing
among
the
shafts
and
wheels
and
musing
horses
and
a
gypsy
woman
on
a
stool
her
head
on
one
side
combing
her
black
hair
and
talking
to
the
children
while
a

catches
at
the
end
of

tresses
when
they
come
swishing
down
beyond
are

of

has
to
be
pitched
to
earn
a
prize

full
of
toys
cheap
jewellery
and
sweets
like
plants
and
stout
women
pattering
alongside
bold
women
with
sleek
black
or
yellow
hair
and
the
bearing
and
countenance
of
women
who
have
to
make
their
way
in
the
world
behind
these
women
are
finishing
their
toilet
and
their
among
the

preparing
meals
over
red
crackling
fires
and
the
horses
rest
their

on

and
watch
the

the
long
yellow
dogs
are
curled
up
among

there
are
men
selling

containing

cosmopolitans
on

basis
with

of
cajolery
intermingled
with
sly
indecency
the
country
policeman
in
the
background
puzzling
over
his
duty
in
the
matter
but
in
the
end
paralyzed
by
the
gift
of
words
one
man
has
before
him
a
counter
on
which
he
asks
you
to
cover
a
disc
with
five
smaller
discs
of
zinc
charging
twopence
for
the
attempt
and
promising
a
watch
to
the
great
man
who
succeeds
after
a
batch
of
failures
he
himself
with
but
bored
face
shows
how
easily
it
is
done
and
raising
his
eyes
in
despair
craves
for
more
courage
from
the
audience
the
crowd
looks
on
hesitating
until
he
singles
out
the
most
bashful
countryman
at
the
back
of
the
throng
saying
like
your
face
you
are
a
good
sort
you
have
a
cheerful
face
the
rich
have
the
sad
faces
so
treat
you
to
a
the
hero
steps
forward
and
succeeds
but
as
it
was
a
free
trial
he
receives
no
watch
trying
again
for
twopence
he
fails
another
tries
jove
that
was
a
near
a
woman
tries
and
just
as
she
is
finishing
a
one
missus
he
ejaculates
and
she
fails
another
tries
and
the
showman
has
a
watch
ready
to
hand
over
and
only
at
the
last
moment
says
excitedly
restoring
the
watch
quietly
to
its
place
thought
got
it
that
time
come
along
the
best
game
in
the
once
more
he
repeats
the
trick
himself
without
looking
and
then
exclaims
as
he
sweeps
the
discs
together
a
silly
game
i
call
it
he
is
like
the
preachers
who
show
the
stupid
world
how
virtue
is
won
he
has
a
large
audience
a
large
paunch
and
many
go
away
disappointed
the
crowd
stares
and
has
the
one
deep
satisfaction
of
believing
that
the
woman
who
travels
with
him
is
not
his
wife
at
the
upper
end
of
the
grove
is
the
gaudy
green
and
gold
and
and
embossed
entrance
to
the
bioscope
raised
a
few
feet
above
the
crowd
on
the
platform
before
the
door
stand
two
painted
men
and
a
girl
the
girl
has
a
large
nose
loose
mouth
and
a
ready
but
uneasy
discontented
smile
as
if
she
knows
that
her
paint
is
an
imperfect
refuge
from
the
gaze
of
the
crowd
as
if
she
knows
that
her
eyes
are
badly
darkened
and
her
white
stockings
soiled
and
her
legs
too
thin
under
her
short
skirt
and
her
yellow
hair
too
stiff
she
lounges
wearily
with
a
glib
clown
who
wears
a
bristly
fringe
of
sandy
hair
round
his
face
which
tickles
her
and
causes
roars
of
laughter
when
he
aims
at
a
kiss
the
other
performer
is
a
contortionist
a
small
slender
man
in
dirty
scarlet
jacket
with
many
small
brass
buttons
dirty
brown
trousers
by
yellow
stripes
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
snub
nose
deep
pink
and
his
lean
face
made
yet
leaner
and
more
dismal
by
a
thin
streak
of
red
paint
on
either
cheek
his
melancholy
seems
natural
yet
adds
to
his
vulgarity
because
he
forsakes
it
so
quickly
when
he
smirks
and
turns
away
if
the
girl
exposes
her
legs
too
much
for
she
turns
a
somersault
with
the
clown
at
intervals
or
doubles
herself
back
to
touch
the
ground
first
with
her
yellow
hair
and
at
last
with
her
head
or
is
lifted
up
by
the
clown
and
supported
on
the
palm
of
one
of
his
hands
hangs
dangling
in
a
limp
bow
her
face
yet
gaunter
and
sadder
upside
down
with
senseless
eyes
and
helpless
legs
the
crowd
watch
looking
sideways
at
one
another
to
get
their
cue
some
with
unconscious
smiles
entranced
but
most
of
them
grimly
controlling
the
emotions
roused
by
the
girl
or
the
contortionist
or
the
clown
and
the
thought
of
their
unstable
life
a
few
squirt
water
languidly
or
toss
confetti
others
look
from
time
to
time
to
see
whether
any
one
in
the
county
dare
in
broad
daylight
enter
the
booth
for
only
at
the
door
of
which
stands
a
shabby
gaudy
woman
of
grinning
contemptuously
up
and
down
moves
the
crowd
stiffly
dressed
children
carrying
gay
toys
or
bowls
of
goldfish
or
cocoanuts

children
with
scarves

or
green
or
red

in

past

proud
grizzled
head

of
soft
felt
low
in
the
crown

jacket

by
auction

plunge
out
of
the
groups
of
men
and
animals
and
carry
a
little
man
suspended
from
their
necks
stout
men
in
grey
gaiters
and
black
hats
bobble
after
or
more
decorously
the
animals
are
trotted
up
and
down
between
rows
of
men
away
from
the
auctioneer
and
back
again
their
price
in
guineas
mingling
with
the
statement
that
they
are
real
workers
while
a
small
boy
hustles
them
with
whip
and
shout
from
behind
and
a
big
stiff
man
leads
them
and
to
turn
them
at
the
end
of
the
run
shoves
his
broad
back
into
their
withers
the
irish
dealers
traffic
apart
and
try
to
sell
without
auction
their
horses
and
ponies
braided
with
primrose
and
scarlet
stand
in
a
quiet
row
suddenly
a
boy
leads
out
one
on
a
halter
a
hard
plump
beast
bucking
madly
and
makes
it
circle
rapidly
about
him
stopping
it
abruptly
and
starting
it
again
with
a
stiff
pink
flag
which
he
flaps
in
its
face
or
pokes
into
its
ribs
if
the
beast
refuses
he
raises
a
high
loud
and
curses
or
growls
like
an
animal
for
perhaps
five
minutes
this
goes
on
the
boy
never
abating
his
oaths
and
growls
and
whoops
and
flirtings
of
the
pink
flag
the
horse
is
led
back
a
muttering
calm
follows
another
horse
is
led
out
here
and
there
are
groups
of
with
huge
pedestalled
feet
and
their
colts
or
of
men
bending
forward
over
long
and
talking
in
low
tones
horses
race
or
walk
or
are
backed
into
the
crowd
droves
of
bullocks
are
driven
through
the
furze
rows
of
bulls
sweating
but
silent
and
quiet
bow
their
heads
and
wait
as
on
a
frieze
again
the
pink
flags
are
flourished
and
the
dealer
catches
a
horsy
stranger
by
the
arm
and
whispers
and
shows
him
the
teeth
this
dealer
is
a
big
irishman
with
flattened
face
and
snaky
nose
his
voice
deep
and
laughing
he
smiles
continually
but
when
he
sees
a
possible
buyer
he
puts
on
an
artful
expression
so
transparent
that
his
merry
face
shines
clearly
underneath
and
remains
the
same
in
triumph
or
rebuke
is
the
same
at
the
end
of
the
day
when
he
leads
off
his
horses
and
stopping
at
a
wayside
inn
drinks
on
the
kerb
but
first
gives
the
one
nearest
him
a
gulp
from
the
tankard
all
night
for
a
week
it
rains
and
at
last
there
is
a
still
morning
of
mist
a
fire
of
weeds
and
in
a
little
flat
field
is
smouldering
the
ashes
are
crimson
and
the
smoke
flows
in
a
divine
cloudy
garment
round
the
boy
who
rakes
over
the
ashes
the
heat
is
great
and
the
boy
straight
and
well
made
wearing
close
gaiters
of
leather
that
reach
above
the
knees
is
languid
at
his
task
and
often
leans
upon
his
rake
to
watch
the
smoke
coiling
away
from
him
like
a
monster
reluctantly
fettered
and
sometimes
bursting
into
an
anger
of
sprinkled
sparks
he
adds
some
wet
hay
and
the
smoke
pours
out
of
it
like
milky
fleeces
when
the
shearer
reveals
the
inmost
wool
with
his
shears
above
and
beyond
him
the
pale
blue
sky
is
dimly
over
beech
woods
whose
many
greens
and
yellows
and
are
softly
touched
by
the
early
light
which
can
not
penetrate
to
the
blue
caverns
of
shade
underneath
athwart
the
woods
rises
a
fount
of
from
among
mellow
and
dim
roofs
under
the
smoke
and
partly
scarfed
at
times
by
a
drift
from
it
is
the
yellow
of
sunflower
and
dahlia
the
white
of
anemone
the
tenderest
green
and
palest
purple
of
a
thick
cluster
of
autumn
crocuses
that
have
broken
out
of
the
dark
earth
and
stand
surprised
amidst
their
own
weak
light
as
of
the
underworld
from
which
they
have
come
robins
sing
among
the
fallen
apples
and
the
cooing
of
is
attuned
to
the
soft
light
and
the
colours
of
the
bowers
the
yellow
apples
gleam
it
is
the
gleam
of
melting
frost
under
all
the
dulcet
warmth
of
the
face
of
things
lurks
the
bitter
spirit
of
the
cold
stand
still
for
more
than
a
few
moments
and
the
cold
creeps
with
a
warning
and
then
a
menace
into
the
breast
that
is
the
bitterness
that
makes
this
morning
of
all
others
in
the
year
so
mournful
in
its
beauty
the
colour
and
the
grace
invite
to
still
contemplation
and
long
draughts
of
dream
the
frost
compels
to
motion
the
scent
is
that
of
of
fruit
and
of
some
fallen
leaves
this
is
the
beginning
of
the
pageant
of
autumn
of
that
gradual
pompous
dying
which
has
no
parallel
in
human
life
yet
draws
us
to
it
with
sure
bonds
it
is
a
dying
of
the
flesh
and
we
see
it
pass
through
a
kind
of
beauty
which
we
can
only
call
spiritual
of
so
high
and
inaccessible
a
strangeness
is
it
the
sight
of
such
perfection
as
is
many
times
achieved
before
the
end
awakens
the
never
more
than
lightly
sleeping
human
desire
of
permanence
now
now
is
the
hour
let
things
be
thus
thus
for
ever
there
is
nothing
further
to
be
thought
of
let
these
remain
and
yet
we
have
a
premonition
that
remain
they
must
not
for
more
than
a
little
while
the
motion
of
the
autumn
is
a
fall
a
surrender
requiring
no
effort
and
therefore
the
mind
can
not
long
be
blind
to
the
cycle
of
things
as
in
the
spring
it
can
when
the
effort
and
delight
of
ascension
veils
the
goal
and
the
decline
beyond
a
few
frosts
now
a
storm
of
wind
and
rain
a
few
brooding
mists
and
the
woods
that
lately
hung
dark
and
massive
and
strong
upon
the
steep
hills
are
transfigured
and
have
become
cloudily
light
and
full
of
change
and
ghostly
fair
the
crowing
of
a
cock
in
the
still
misty
morning
echoes
up
in
the
trees
like
a
challenge
to
the
spirits
of
them
to
come
out
and
be
seen
but
in
vain
for
months
the
woods
have
been
homely
and
kind
companions
and
backgrounds
to
our
actions
and
thoughts
the
wide
walls
of
a
mansion
utterly
our
own
we
could
have
gone
on
living
with
them
for
ever
we
had
given
up
the
ardours
the
extreme
ecstasy
of
our
first
bridal
affection
but
we
had
not
forgotten
them
we
could
not
become
indifferent
to
the
spanish
that
grow
at
the
top
of
the
steep
rocky
banks
on
either
side
of
the
road
and
mingle
their
foliage
overhead
of
all
trees
chestnuts
are
among
the
most
pleasant
to
look
up
at
for
the
foliage
is
not
dense
and
it
is
for
the
most
part
close
to
the
large
boughs
so
that
the
light
comes
easily
down
through
all
the
horizontal
leaves
and
the
shape
of
each
separate
one
is
not
lost
in
the
multitude
while
at
the
same
time
the
bold
twists
of
the
branches
are
undraped
or
easily
seen
through
such
translucent
green
the
trunks
are
crooked
and
the
handsome
deep
furrowing
of
the
bark
is
often
spirally
cut
the
limbs
are
few
and
wide
apart
so
as
to
frame
huge
delicately
lighted
and
shadowed
chambers
of
silence
or
of
song
the
leaves
turn
all
together
to
a
leathern
hue
and
when
they
fall
stiffen
and
display
their
shape
on
the
ground
and
long
refuse
to
be
merged
in
the
dismal
trodden
hosts
but
when
the
first
one
floats
past
the
eye
and
is
blown
like
a
canoe
over
the
pond
we
recover
once
more
our
knowledge
and
fear
of
time
all
those
ladders
of
that
scaled
the
hedges
of
spring
are
dead
grey
they
are
still
in
their
places
but
they
clamber
no
longer
the
chief
flower
is
the
yellow
bloom
set
in
the
dark
ivy
round
the
trunks
of
the
and
where
it
climbs
over
the
holly
and
makes
a
solid
sunny
wall
and
in
the
hedges
a
whole
people
of
wasps
and
flies
are
always
at
the
bloom
with
crystal
wings
except
when
a
passing
shadow
disperses
them
for
a
moment
with
one
buzz
but
these
can
not
long
detain
the
eye
from
the
crumbling
woods
in
the
haze
or
under
the
large
white
clouds
from
the
amber
and
orange
bracken
about
our
knees
and
the
blue
recesses
among
the
distant
golden
beeches
when
the
sky
is
blue
but
beginning
to
be
laden
with
loose
from
the
line
of
poplars
that
bend
against
the
twilight
sky
and
there
is
no
scent
of
flowers
to
hide
that
of
dead
leaves
and
rotting
fruit
we
must
watch
it
until
the
end
and
gain
slowly
the
philosophy
or
the
memory
or
the
forgetfulness
that
fits
us
for
accepting
boon
pauses
there
are
of
course
or
what
seem
pauses
in
the
declining
of
this
pomp
afternoons
when
the
rooks
waver
and
caw
over
their
beechen
town
and
the
pigeons
coo
content
dawns
when
the
white
mist
is
packed
like
snow
over
the
vale
and
the
high
woods
take
the
level
beams
and
a
hundred
globes
of
dew
glitter
on
every
thread
of
the
hammocks
or
loose
perpendicular
nets
among
the
thorns
and
through
the
mist
rings
the
anvil
a
mile
away
with
a
music
as
merry
as
that
of
the
daws
that
soar
and
dive
between
the
beeches
and
the
spun
white
cloud
mornings
full
of
the
sweetness
of
mushrooms
and
blackberries
from
the
short
turf
among
the
blue
scabious
bloom
and
the
gorgeous
brier
empurpled
evenings
before
frost
when
the
robin
sings
passionate
and
shrill
and
from
the
garden
earth
float
the
smells
of
a
hundred
roots
with
messages
of
the
dark
world
and
hours
full
of
the
soft
november
music
the
end
should
come
in
heavy
and
lasting
rain
at
all
times
i
love
rain
the
early
momentous
thunderdrops
the
perpendicular
cataract
shining
or
at
night
the
little
showers
the
spongy
mists
the
tempestuous
mountain
rain
i
like
to
see
it
possessing
the
whole
earth
at
evening
smothering
civilization
taking
away
from
me
myself
everything
except
the
power
to
walk
under
the
dark
trees
and
to
enjoy
as
humbly
as
the
hissing
grass
while
some
twinkling
or
song
sung
by
a
lonely
man
gives
a
foil
to
the
immense
dark
force
i
like
to
see
the
rain
making
the
streets
the
railway
station
a
pure
desert
whether
bright
with
lamps
or
not
it
foams
all
the
roofs
and
trees
and
bubbles
into
the
it
gives
the
grey
rivers
a
demonic
majesty
it
scours
the
roads
sets
the
flints
moving
and
exposes
the
glossy
chalk
in
the
tracks
through
the
woods
it
does
work
that
will
last
as
long
as
the
earth
it
is
about
eternal
business
in
its
noise
and
myriad
aspect
i
feel
the
mortal
beauty
of
immortal
things
and
then
after
many
days
the
rain
ceases
at
midnight
with
the
wind
and
in
the
silence
of
dawn
and
frost
the
last
rose
of
the
world
is
dropping
her
petals
down
to
the
glistering
whiteness
and
there
they
rest
on
the
desolate
coast
