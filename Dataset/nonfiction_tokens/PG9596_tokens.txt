there
is
a
large
class
of
men
not
in
europe
alone
but
in
this
country
also
whose
constitutional
conservatism
inclines
them
to
regard
any
organic
change
in
the
government
of
a
state
or
the
social
condition
of
its
people
with
suspicion
and
distrust
they
admit
perhaps
the
evils
of
the
old
state
of
things
but
they
hold
them
to
be
inevitable
the
alloy
necessarily
mingled
with
all
which
pertains
to
fallible
humanity
themselves
generally
enjoying
whatever
of
good
belongs
to
the
political
or
social
system
in
which
their
lot
is
cast
they
are
disposed
to
look
with
philosophic
indifference
upon
the
evil
which
only
afflicts
their
neighbors
they
wonder
why
people
are
not
contented
with
their
allotments
they
see
no
reason
for
change
they
ask
for
quiet
and
peace
in
their
day
being
quite
well
satisfied
with
that
social
condition
which
an
old
poet
has
quaintly
described
the
citizens
like
pounded
pikes
the
lesser
feed
the
great
the
rich
for
food
seek
stomachs
and
the
poor
for
stomachs
meat
this
class
of
our
have
an
especial
dislike
of
theorists
reformers
uneasy
spirits
speculators
upon
the
possibilities
of
the
world
future
constitution
builders
and
believers
in
progress
they
are
satisfied
the
world
at
least
goes
well
enough
with
them
they
sit
as
comfortable
in
it
as
lafontaine
rat
in
the
cheese
and
why
should
those
who
would
turn
it
upside
down
come
hither
also
why
not
let
well
enough
alone
why
tinker
creeds
constitutions
and
laws
and
disturb
the
good
order
of
things
in
church
and
state
the
idea
of
making
the
world
better
and
happier
is
to
them
an
absurdity
he
who
entertains
it
is
a
dreamer
and
a
visionary
destitute
of
common
sense
and
practical
wisdom
his
project
whatever
it
may
be
is
at
once
pronounced
to
be
impracticable
folly
or
as
they
are
pleased
to
term
it
the
romance
of
sir
thomas
more
which
has
long
afforded
to
the
conservatives
of
church
and
state
a
term
of
contempt
applicable
to
all
reformatory
schemes
and
innovations
is
one
of
a
series
of
fabulous
writings
in
which
the
authors
living
in
evil
times
and
unable
to
actualize
their
plans
for
the
of
society
have
resorted
to
fiction
as
a
safe
means
of
conveying
forbidden
truths
to
the
popular
mind
plato
timaeus
the
first
of
the
series
was
written
after
the
death
of
socrates
and
the
enslavement
of
the
author
country
in
this
are
described
the
institutions
of
the
island
of
atlantis
the
ideal
of
a
perfect
commonwealth
xenophon
in
his
cyropaedia
has
also
depicted
an
imaginary
political
society
by
overlaying
with
fiction
historical
traditions
at
a
later
period
we
have
the
new
atlantis
of
lord
bacon
and
that
dream
of
the
city
of
the
sun
with
which
campanella
solaced
himself
in
his
long
imprisonment
the
utopia
of
more
is
perhaps
the
best
of
its
class
it
is
the
work
of
a
profound
thinker
the
suggestive
speculations
and
theories
of
one
who
could
forerun
his
age
and
race
and
let
his
feet
millenniums
hence
be
set
in
midst
of
knowledge
dreamed
not
yet
much
of
what
he
wrote
as
fiction
is
now
fact
a
part
of
the
of
european
governments
and
the
political
truths
of
his
imaginary
state
are
now
practically
recognized
in
our
own
democratic
system
as
might
be
expected
in
view
of
the
times
in
which
the
author
wrote
and
the
exceedingly
limited
amount
of
materials
which
he
found
ready
to
his
hands
for
the
construction
of
his
social
and
political
edifice
there
is
a
want
of
proportion
and
symmetry
in
the
structure
many
of
his
theories
are
no
doubt
impracticable
and
unsound
but
as
a
whole
the
work
is
an
admirable
one
striding
in
advance
of
the
author
age
and
prefiguring
a
government
of
religious
toleration
and
political
freedom
the
following
extract
from
it
was
doubtless
regarded
in
his
day
as
something
worse
than
folly
or
the
dream
of
a
visionary
enthusiast
he
judged
it
wrong
to
lay
down
anything
rashly
and
seemed
to
doubt
whether
these
different
forms
of
religion
might
not
all
come
from
god
who
might
inspire
men
in
a
different
manner
and
be
pleased
with
the
variety
he
therefore
thought
it
to
be
indecent
and
foolish
for
any
man
to
threaten
and
terrify
another
to
make
him
believe
what
did
not
strike
him
as
true
passing
by
the
telemachus
of
fenelon
we
come
to
the
political
romance
of
harrington
written
in
the
time
of
cromwell
oceana
is
the
name
by
which
the
author
represents
england
and
the
republican
plan
of
government
which
he
describes
with
much
minuteness
is
such
as
he
would
have
recommended
for
adoption
in
case
a
free
commonwealth
had
been
established
it
deals
somewhat
severely
with
cromwell
usurpation
yet
the
author
did
not
hesitate
to
dedicate
it
to
that
remarkable
man
who
after
carefully
reading
it
gave
it
back
to
his
daughter
lady
claypole
with
the
remark
full
of
characteristic
bluntness
that
the
gentleman
need
not
think
to
cheat
him
of
his
power
and
authority
for
what
he
had
won
with
the
sword
he
would
never
suffer
himself
to
be
scribbled
out
of
notwithstanding
the
liberality
and
freedom
of
his
speculations
upon
government
and
religion
in
his
utopia
it
must
be
confessed
that
sir
thomas
more
in
after
life
fell
into
the
very
practices
of
intolerance
and
bigotry
which
he
condemned
when
in
the
possession
of
the
great
seal
under
that
scandal
of
kingship
henry
he
gave
his
countenance
to
the
persecution
of
heretics
bishop
burnet
says
of
him
that
he
caused
a
gentleman
of
the
temple
to
be
whipped
and
put
to
the
rack
in
his
presence
in
order
to
compel
him
to
discover
those
who
favored
heretical
opinions
in
his
utopia
he
assailed
the
profession
of
the
law
with
merciless
satire
yet
the
satirist
himself
finally
sat
upon
the
chancellor
woolsack
and
as
has
been
well
remarked
by
horace
smith
if
from
this
elevated
seat
he
ever
cast
his
eyes
back
upon
his
past
life
he
must
have
smiled
at
the
fond
conceit
which
could
imagine
a
permanent
utopia
when
he
himself
certainly
more
learned
honest
and
conscientious
than
the
mass
of
men
has
ever
been
could
in
the
course
of
one
short
life
fall
into
such
glaring
and
frightful
rebellion
against
his
own
doctrines
harrington
on
the
other
hand
as
became
the
friend
of
milton
and
marvel
held
fast
through
good
and
evil
report
his
republican
faith
he
published
his
work
after
the
restoration
and
defended
it
boldly
and
ably
from
the
numerous
attacks
made
upon
it
regarded
as
too
dangerous
an
enthusiast
to
be
left
at
liberty
he
was
imprisoned
at
the
instance
of
lord
chancellor
hyde
first
in
the
tower
and
afterwards
on
the
island
of
nicholas
where
disease
and
imprudent
remedies
brought
on
a
partial
derangement
from
which
he
never
recovered
bernardin
pierre
whose
pathetic
tale
of
paul
and
virginia
has
found
admirers
in
every
language
of
the
civilized
world
in
a
fragment
entitled
arcadia
attempted
to
depict
an
ideal
republic
without
priest
noble
or
slave
where
all
are
so
religious
that
each
man
is
the
pontiff
of
his
family
where
each
man
is
prepared
to
defend
his
country
and
where
all
are
in
such
a
state
of
equality
that
there
are
no
such
persons
as
servants
the
plan
of
it
was
suggested
by
his
friend
rousseau
during
their
pleasant
walking
excursions
about
the
environs
of
paris
in
which
the
two
enthusiastic
philosophers
baffled
by
the
evil
passions
and
intractable
materials
of
human
nature
as
manifested
in
existing
society
comforted
themselves
by
appealing
from
the
actual
to
the
possible
from
the
real
to
the
imaginary
under
the
of
the
bois
de
boulogne
through
long
summer
days
the
two
friends
sick
of
the
noisy
world
about
them
yet
yearning
to
become
its
benefactors
gladly
escaping
from
it
yet
busy
with
schemes
for
its
regeneration
and
happiness
at
once
misanthropes
and
philanthropists
amused
and
solaced
themselves
by
imagining
a
perfect
and
simple
state
of
society
in
which
the
lessons
of
emulation
and
selfish
ambition
were
never
to
be
taught
where
on
the
contrary
the
young
were
to
obey
their
parents
and
to
prefer
father
mother
brother
sister
wife
and
friend
to
themselves
they
drew
beautiful
pictures
of
a
country
blessed
with
peace
indus
try
and
love
covered
with
no
disgusting
monuments
of
violence
and
pride
and
luxury
without
columns
triumphal
arches
hospitals
prisons
or
gibbets
but
presenting
to
view
bridges
over
torrents
wells
on
the
arid
plain
groves
of
and
houses
of
shelter
for
the
traveller
in
desert
places
attesting
everywhere
the
sentiment
of
humanity
religion
was
to
speak
to
all
hearts
in
the
eternal
language
of
nature
death
was
no
longer
to
be
feared
perspectives
of
holy
consolation
were
to
open
through
the
cypress
shadows
of
the
tomb
to
live
or
to
die
was
to
be
equally
an
object
of
desire
the
plan
of
the
arcadia
of
pierre
is
simply
this
a
learned
young
egyptian
educated
at
thebes
by
the
priests
of
osiris
desirous
of
benefiting
humanity
undertakes
a
voyage
to
gaul
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
thither
the
arts
and
religion
of
egypt
he
is
shipwrecked
on
his
return
in
the
gulf
of
messina
and
lands
upon
the
coast
where
he
is
entertained
by
an
arcadian
to
whom
he
relates
his
adventures
and
from
whom
he
receives
in
turn
an
account
of
the
simple
happiness
and
peace
of
arcadia
the
virtues
and
felicity
of
whose
inhabitants
are
beautifully
exemplified
in
the
lives
and
conversation
of
the
shepherd
and
his
daughter
this
pleasant
little
prose
poem
closes
somewhat
abruptly
although
inferior
in
artistic
skill
to
paul
and
virginia
or
the
indian
cottage
there
is
not
a
little
to
admire
in
the
simple
beauty
of
its
pastoral
descriptions
the
closing
paragraph
reminds
one
of
upper
chamber
where
the
weary
pilgrim
windows
opened
to
the
sunrising
and
the
singing
of
birds
tyrteus
conducted
his
guests
to
an
adjoining
chamber
it
had
a
window
shut
by
a
curtain
of
rushes
through
the
crevices
of
which
the
islands
of
the
alpheus
might
be
seen
in
the
light
of
the
moon
there
were
in
this
chamber
two
excellent
beds
with
coverlets
of
warm
and
light
wool
now
as
soon
as
amasis
was
left
alone
with
cephas
he
spoke
with
joy
of
the
delight
and
tranquillity
of
the
valley
of
the
goodness
of
the
shepherd
and
the
grace
of
his
young
daughter
to
whom
he
had
seen
none
worthy
to
be
compared
and
of
the
pleasure
which
he
promised
himself
the
next
day
at
the
festival
on
mount
lyceum
of
beholding
a
whole
people
as
happy
as
this
sequestered
family
converse
so
delightful
might
have
charmed
away
the
night
without
the
aid
of
sleep
had
they
not
been
invited
to
repose
by
the
mild
light
of
the
moon
shining
through
the
window
the
murmuring
wind
in
the
leaves
of
the
poplars
and
the
distant
noise
of
the
achelous
which
falls
roaring
from
the
summit
of
mount
lyceum
the
young
patrician
wits
of
athens
doubtless
laughed
over
plato
ideal
republic
campanella
city
of
the
sun
was
looked
upon
no
doubt
as
the
distempered
vision
of
a
crazy
state
prisoner
bacon
college
in
his
new
atlantis
moved
the
risibles
of
oxford
utopia
as
we
know
gave
to
our
language
a
new
word
expressive
of
the
vagaries
and
dreams
of
fanatics
and
lunatics
the
merciless
wits
clerical
and
profane
of
the
court
of
charles
ii
regarded
romance
as
a
perfect
godsend
to
their
vocation
of
ridicule
the
gay
dames
and
carpet
knights
of
versailles
made
themselves
merry
with
the
prose
pastoral
of
pierre
and
the
poor
old
enthusiast
went
down
to
his
grave
without
finding
an
auditory
for
his
lectures
upon
natural
society
the
world
had
its
laugh
over
these
romances
when
unable
to
refute
their
theories
it
could
sneer
at
the
authors
and
answer
them
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
generation
in
which
they
lived
at
least
by
a
general
charge
of
lunacy
some
of
their
notions
were
no
doubt
as
absurd
as
those
of
the
astronomer
in
rasselas
who
tells
imlac
that
he
has
for
five
years
possessed
the
regulation
of
the
weather
and
has
got
the
secret
of
making
to
the
different
nations
an
equal
and
impartial
dividend
of
rain
and
sunshine
but
truth
even
when
ushered
into
the
world
through
the
medium
of
a
dull
romance
and
in
connection
with
a
vast
progeny
of
errors
however
ridiculed
and
despised
at
first
never
fails
in
the
end
of
finding
a
in
the
popular
mind
the
speculations
of
the
political
theorists
whom
we
have
noticed
have
not
all
proved
to
be
of
such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
of
and
their
little
life
rounded
with
sleep
they
have
entered
into
and
become
parts
of
the
social
and
political
fabrics
of
europe
and
america
the
prophecies
of
imagination
have
been
fulfilled
the
dreams
of
romance
have
become
familiar
realities
what
is
the
moral
suggested
by
this
record
is
it
not
that
we
should
look
with
charity
and
tolerance
upon
the
schemes
and
speculations
of
the
political
and
social
theorists
of
our
day
that
if
unprepared
to
venture
upon
new
experiments
and
radical
changes
we
should
at
least
consider
that
what
was
folly
to
our
ancestors
is
our
wisdom
and
that
another
generation
may
successfully
put
in
practice
the
very
theories
which
now
seem
to
us
absurd
and
impossible
many
of
the
evils
of
society
have
been
measurably
removed
or
ameliorated
yet
now
as
in
the
days
of
the
apostle
the
creation
groaneth
and
travaileth
in
pain
and
although
quackery
and
empiricism
abound
is
it
not
possible
that
a
proper
application
of
some
of
the
remedies
proposed
might
ameliorate
the
general
suffering
rejecting
as
we
must
whatever
is
inconsistent
with
or
hostile
to
the
doctrines
of
christianity
on
which
alone
rests
our
hope
for
humanity
it
becomes
us
to
look
kindly
upon
all
attempts
to
apply
those
doctrines
to
the
details
of
human
life
to
the
social
political
and
industrial
relations
of
the
race
if
it
is
not
permitted
us
to
believe
all
things
we
can
at
least
hope
them

is
infidelity
and

perusal
of

documents
recently
submitted
to
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
massachusetts
they
indicate
in
our
view
the
real
glory
of

state
and
foreshadow
the
coming
of
that
time

commonwealth
shall
be
no
longer
a
prophecy
but
the
description
of

fact

a
mighty
growth
and
stature
of
an
honest
man
moved
by
the
purpose
of
a
love
of
god
and
of
mankind
some
years
ago
the
legislature
of
massachusetts
at
the
suggestion
of
several
benevolent
gentlemen
whose
attention
had
been
turned
to
the
subject
appointed
a
commission
to
inquire
into
the
condition
of
the
idiots
of
the
commonwealth
to
ascertain
their
numbers
and
whether
anything
could
be
done
in
their
behalf
the
commissioners
were

so
well
and
honorably
known
for
his
long
and
arduous
labors
in
behalf
of
the
blind
judge
byington
and
gilman
kimball
the
burden
of
the
labor
fell
upon
the
chairman
who
entered
upon
it
with
the
enthusiasm
perseverance
and
practical
adaptation
of
means
to
ends
which
have
made
him
so
efficient
in
his
varied
schemes
of
benevolence
on
the
of
the
second
month
a
full
report
of
the
results
of
this
labor
was
made
to
the
governor
accompanied
by
statistical
tables
and
minute
details
one
hundred
towns
had
been
visited
by
the
chairman
or
his
reliable
agent
in
which
five
hundred
and
persons
in
a
state
of
idiocy
were
discovered
these
were
examined
carefully
in
respect
to
their
physical
as
well
as
mental
condition
no
inquiry
being
omitted
which
was
calculated
to
throw
light
upon
the
remote
or
immediate
causes
of
this
mournful
imperfection
in
the
creation
of
god
the
proximate
causes
howe
mentions
are
to
be
found
in
the
state
of
the
bodily
organization
deranged
and
disproportioned
by
some
violation
of
natural
law
on
the
part
of
the
parents
or
remoter
ancestors
of
the
sufferers
out
of
cases
of
idiocy
he
had
obtained
information
respecting
the
condition
of
the
progenitors
of
and
in
all
but
four
of
these
eases
he
found
that
one
or
the
other
or
both
of
their
immediate
progenitors
had
in
some
way
departed
widely
from
the
condition
of
health
they
were
scrofulous
or
predisposed
to
affections
of
the
brain
and
insanity
or
had
intermarried
with
or
had
been
intemperate
or
guilty
of
sensual
excesses
of
the
cases
were
those
of
idiocy
from
birth
and
of
idiocy
afterwards
of
the
born
idiots
were
under
years
of
age
and
all
but
seemed
capable
of
improvement
of
those
above
years
of
age
appeared
incapable
of
improvement
in
their
mental
condition
being
helpless
as
children
at
seven
years
of
age
out
of
the
seemed
as
helpless
as
children
at
two
years
of
age
were
in
the
condition
of
mere
infants
and
were
supported
at
the
public
charge
in
almshouses
a
large
proportion
of
them
were
found
to
be
given
over
to
filthy
and
loathsome
habits
gluttony
and
lust
and
constantly
sinking
lower
towards
the
condition
of
absolute
brutishness
those
in
private
houses
were
found
if
possible
in
a
still
more
deplorable
state
their
parents
were
generally
poor
feeble
in
mind
and
body
and
often
of
very
intemperate
habits
many
of
them
seemed
scarcely
able
to
take
care
of
themselves
and
totally
unfit
for
the
training
of
ordinary
children
it
was
the
blind
leading
the
blind
imbecility
teaching
imbecility
some
instances
of
the
experiments
of
parental
ignorance
upon
idiotic
offspring
which
fell
under
the
observation
of
howe
are
related
in
his
report
idiotic
children
were
found
with
their
heads
covered
over
with
cold
poultices
of
which
the
foolish
parents
supposed
would
tan
the
brain
and
harden
it
as
the
tanner
does
his
and
so
make
it
capable
of
retaining
impressions
and
remembering
lessons
in
other
cases
finding
that
the
child
could
not
be
made
to
comprehend
anything
the
sagacious
heads
of
the
household
on
the
supposition
that
its
brain
was
too
hard
tortured
it
with
hot
poultices
of
bread
and
milk
to
soften
it
others
plastered
over
their
heads
with
tar
some
administered
strong
doses
of
mercury
to
solder
up
the
openings
in
the
head
and
make
it
tight
and
strong
others
encouraged
the
savage
gluttony
of
their
children
stimulating
their
unnatural
and
bestial
appetites
on
the
ground
that
the
poor
creatures
had
nothing
else
to
enjoy
but
their
food
and
they
should
have
enough
of
that
in
consequence
of
this
report
the
legislature
in
the
spring
of
made
an
annual
appropriation
of
hundred
dollars
for
three
years
for
the
purpose
of
training
and
teaching
ten
idiot
children
to
be
selected
by
the
governor
and
council
the
trustees
of
the
asylum
for
the
blind
under
the
charge
of
howe
made
arrangements
for
receiving
these
pupils
the
school
was
opened
in
the
autumn
of
and
its
first
annual
report
addressed
to
the
governor
and
printed
by
order
of
the
senate
is
now
before
us
of
the
ten
pupils
it
appears
that
not
one
had
the
usual
command
of
muscular
motion
the
languid
body
obeyed
not
the
service
of
the
imbecile
will
some
could
walk
and
use
their
limbs
and
hands
in
simple
motions
others
could
make
only
make
slight
use
of
their
muscles
and
two
were
without
any
power
of
locomotion
one
of
these
last
a
boy
six
years
of
age
who
had
been
stupefied
on
the
day
of
his
birth
by
the
application
of
hot
rum
to
his
head
could
scarcely
see
or
notice
objects
and
was
almost
destitute
of
the
sense
of
touch
he
could
neither
stand
nor
sit
upright
nor
even
creep
but
would
lie
on
the
floor
in
whatever
position
he
was
placed
he
could
not
feed
himself
nor
chew
solid
food
and
had
no
more
sense
of
decency
than
an
infant
his
intellect
was
a
blank
he
had
no
knowledge
no
desires
no
affections
a
more
hopeless
object
for
experiment
could
scarcely
have
been
selected
a
year
of
patient
endeavor
has
nevertheless
wrought
a
wonderful
change
in
the
condition
of
this
miserable
being
cold
bathing
rubbing
of
the
limbs
exercise
of
the
muscles
exposure
to
the
air
and
other
appliances
have
enabled
him
to
stand
upright
to
sit
at
table
and
feed
himself
and
chew
his
food
and
to
walk
about
with
slight
assistance
his
habits
are
no
longer
those
of
a
brute
he
observes
decency
his
eye
is
brighter
his
cheeks
glow
with
health
his
countenance
is
more
expressive
of
thought
he
has
learned
many
words
and
constructs
simple
sentences
his
affections
begin
to
develop
and
there
is
every
prospect
that
he
will
be
so
far
renovated
as
to
be
able
to
provide
for
himself
in
manhood
in
the
case
of
another
boy
aged
twelve
years
the
improvement
has
been
equally
remarkable
the
gentleman
who
first
called
attention
to
him
in
a
recent
note
to
howe
published
in
the
report
thus
speaks
of
his
present
condition
when
i
remember
his
former
wild
and
almost
frantic
demeanor
when
approached
by
any
one
and
the
apparent
impossibility
of
communicating
with
him
and
now
see
him
standing
in
his
class
playing
with
his
fellows
and
willingly
and
familiarly
approaching
me
examining
what
i
gave
him
and
when
i
see
him
already
selecting
articles
named
by
his
teacher
and
even
correctly
pronouncing
words
printed
on
cards
improvement
does
not
convey
the
idea
presented
to
my
mind
it
is
creation
it
is
making
him
anew
all
the
pupils
have
more
or
less
advanced
their
health
and
habits
have
improved
and
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
that
the
experiment
at
the
close
of
its
three
years
will
be
found
to
have
been
quite
as
successful
as
its
most
sanguine
projectors
could
have
anticipated
howe
has
been
ably
seconded
by
an
accomplished
teacher
james
richards
who
has
devoted
his
whole
time
to
the
pupils
of
the
nature
and
magnitude
of
their
task
an
idea
may
be
formed
only
by
considering
the
utter
listlessness
of
idiocy
the
incapability
of
the
poor
pupil
to
fix
his
attention
upon
anything
and
his
general
want
of
susceptibility
to
impressions
all
his
senses
are
dulled
and
perverted
touch
hearing
sight
smell
are
all
more
or
less
defective
his
gluttony
is
unaccompanied
with
the
gratification
of
taste
the
most
savory
viands
and
the
offal
which
he
shares
with
the
pigs
equally
satisfy
him
his
mental
state
is
still
worse
than
his
physical
thought
is
painful
and
irksome
to
him
his
teacher
can
only
engage
his
attention
by
strenuous
efforts
loud
earnest
tones
gesticulations
and
signs
and
a
constant
presentation
of
some
visible
object
of
bright
color
and
striking
form
the
eye
wanders
and
the
spark
of
consciousness
and
intelligence
which
has
been
fanned
into
momentary
brightness
darkens
at
the
slightest
relaxation
of
the
teacher
exertions
the
names
of
objects
presented
to
him
must
sometimes
be
repeated
hundreds
of
times
before
he
can
learn
them
yet
the
patience
and
enthusiasm
of
the
teacher
are
rewarded
by
a
progress
slow
and
unequal
but
still
marked
and
manifest
step
by
step
often
compelled
to
turn
back
and
go
over
the
inch
of
ground
he
had
gained
the
idiot
is
still
creeping
forward
and
by
almost
imperceptible
degrees
his
sick
cramped
and
prisoned
spirit
casts
off
the
burden
of
its
body
of
death
breath
as
from
the
almighty
is
breathed
into
him
and
he
becomes
a
living
soul
after
the
senses
of
the
idiot
are
trained
to
take
note
of
their
appropriate
objects
the
various
perceptive
faculties
are
next
to
be
exercised
the
greatest
possible
number
of
facts
are
to
be
gathered
up
through
the
medium
of
these
faculties
into
the
storehouse
of
memory
from
whence
eventually
the
higher
faculties
of
mind
may
draw
the
material
of
general
ideas
it
has
been
found
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
teach
the
idiot
to
read
by
the
letters
first
as
in
the
ordinary
method
but
while
the
varied
powers
of
the
three
letters
h
a
t
could
not
be
understood
by
him
he
could
be
made
to
comprehend
the
complex
sign
of
the
word
hat
made
by
uniting
the
three
the
moral
nature
of
the
idiot
needs
training
and
development
as
well
as
his
physical
and
mental
all
that
can
be
said
of
him
is
that
he
has
the
latent
capacity
for
moral
development
and
culture
uninstructed
and
left
to
himself
he
has
no
ideas
of
regulated
appetites
and
propensities
of
decency
and
delicacy
of
affection
and
social
relations
the
germs
of
these
ideas
which
constitute
the
glory
and
beauty
of
humanity
undoubtedly
exist
in
him
but
there
can
be
no
growth
without
patient
and
persevering
culture
where
this
is
afforded
to
use
the
language
of
the
report
the
idiot
may
learn
what
love
is
though
he
may
not
know
the
word
which
expresses
it
he
may
feel
kindly
affections
while
unable
to
understand
the
simplest
virtuous
principle
and
he
may
begin
to
live
acceptably
to
god
before
he
has
learned
the
name
by
which
men
call
him
in
the
facts
and
statistics
presented
in
the
report
light
is
shed
upon
some
of
the
dark
pages
of
god
providence
and
it
is
seen
that
the
suffering
and
shame
of
idiocy
are
the
result
of
sin
of
a
violation
of
the
merciful
laws
of
god
and
of
the
harmonies
of
his
benign
order
the
penalties
which
are
ordained
for
the
violators
of
natural
laws
are
inexorable
and
certain
for
the
transgressor
of
the
laws
of
life
there
is
as
in
the
case
of
esau
no
place
for
repentance
though
he
seek
it
earnestly
and
with
tears
the
curse
cleaves
to
him
and
his
children
in
this
view
how
important
becomes
the
subject
of
the
hereditary
transmission
of
moral
and
physical
disease
and
debility
and
how
necessary
it
is
that
there
should
be
a
clearer
understanding
of
and
a
willing
obedience
at
any
cost
to
the
eternal
law
which
makes
the
parent
the
blessing
or
the
curse
of
the
child
giving
strength
and
beauty
and
the
capacity
to
know
and
do
the
will
of
god
or
bequeathing
loathsomeness
deformity
and
animal
appetite
incapable
of
the
restraints
of
the
moral
faculties
even
if
the
labors
of
howe
and
his
benevolent
associates
do
not
materially
lessen
the
amount
of
present
actual
evil
and
suffering
in
this
respect
they
will
not
be
put
forth
in
vain
if
they
have
the
effect
of
calling
public
attention
to
the
great
laws
of
our
being
the
violation
of
which
has
made
this
goodly
earth
a
vast
lazarhouse
of
pain
and
sorrow
the
late
annual
message
of
the
governor
of
massachusetts
invites
our
attention
to
a
kindred
institution
of
charity
the
chief
magistrate
congratulates
the
legislature
in
language
creditable
to
his
mind
and
heart
on
the
opening
of
the
reform
school
for
juvenile
criminals
established
by
an
act
of
a
previous
legislature
the
act
provides
that
when
any
boy
under
sixteen
years
of
age
shall
be
convicted
of
crime
punishable
by
imprisonment
other
than
such
an
offence
as
is
punished
by
imprisonment
for
life
he
may
be
at
the
discretion
of
the
court
or
justice
sent
to
the
state
reform
school
or
sentenced
to
such
imprisonment
as
the
law
now
provides
for
his
offence
the
school
is
placed
under
the
care
of
trustees
who
may
either
refuse
to
receive
a
boy
thus
sent
there
or
after
he
has
been
received
for
reasons
set
forth
in
the
act
may
order
him
to
be
committed
to
prison
under
the
previous
penal
law
of
the
state
they
are
also
authorized
to
apprentice
the
boys
at
their
discretion
to
inhabitants
of
the
commonwealth
and
whenever
any
boy
shall
be
discharged
either
as
reformed
or
as
having
reached
the
age
of
years
his
discharge
is
a
full
release
from
his
sentence
it
is
made
the
duty
of
the
trustees
to
cause
the
boys
to
be
instructed
in
piety
and
morality
and
in
branches
of
useful
knowledge
in
some
regular
course
of
labor
mechanical
agricultural
or
horticultural
and
such
other
trades
and
arts
as
may
be
best
adapted
to
secure
the
amendment
reformation
and
future
benefit
of
the
boys
the
class
of
offenders
for
whom
this
act
provides
are
generally
the
offspring
of
parents
depraved
by
crime
or
suffering
from
poverty
and
want
the
victims
often
of
circumstances
of
evil
which
almost
constitute
a
necessity
issuing
from
homes
polluted
and
miserable
from
the
sight
and
hearing
of
loathsome
impurities
and
hideous
discords
to
avenge
upon
society
the
ignorance
and
destitution
and
neglect
with
which
it
is
too
often
justly
chargeable
in
three
hundred
of
these
youthful
violators
of
law
were
sentenced
to
jails
and
other
places
of
punishment
in
massachusetts
where
they
incurred
the
fearful
liability
of
being
still
more
thoroughly
corrupted
by
contact
with
older
criminals
familiar
with
atrocity
and
rolling
their
loathsome
vices
as
a
sweet
morsel
under
the
tongue
in
view
of
this
state
of
things
the
reform
school
has
been
established
thousand
dollars
having
been
contributed
to
the
state
for
that
purpose
by
an
unknown
benefactor
of
his
race
the
school
is
located
in
westboro
on
a
fine
farm
of
two
hundred
acres
the
buildings
are
in
the
form
of
a
square
with
a
court
in
the
centre
three
stories
in
front
with
wings
they
are
constructed
with
a
degree
of
architectural
taste
and
their
site
is
happily
chosen
a
gentle
eminence
overlooking
one
of
the
loveliest
of
the
small
lakes
which
form
a
pleasing
feature
in
new
england
scenery
from
this
place
the
atmosphere
and
associations
of
the
prison
are
excluded
the
discipline
is
strict
as
a
matter
of
course
but
it
is
that
of
a
home
or
order
neatness
and
harmony
within
doors
and
without
the
beautiful
and
sounds
and
healthful
influences
of
nature
one
would
almost
suppose
that
the
poetical
dream
of
coleridge
in
his
tragedy
of
remorse
had
found
its
realization
in
the
westboro
school
and
that
weary
of
the
hopelessness
and
cruelty
of
the
old
penal
system
our
legislators
had
embodied
in
their
statutes
the
idea
of
the
poet
with
other
ministrations
thou
o
nature
healest
thy
wandering
and
distempered
child
thou
pourest
on
him
thy
soft
influences
thy
sunny
hues
fair
forms
and
breathing
sweets
thy
melodies
of
woods
and
winds
and
waters
till
he
relent
and
can
no
more
endure
to
be
a
jarring
and
a
dissonant
thing
amidst
this
general
dance
and
minstrelsy
thus
it
is
that
the
christian
idea
of
reformation
rather
than
revenge
is
slowly
but
surely
incorporating
itself
in
our
statute
books
we
have
only
to
look
back
but
a
single
century
to
be
able
to
appreciate
the
immense
gain
for
humanity
in
the
treatment
of
criminals
which
has
been
secured
in
that
space
of
time
then
the
use
of
torture
was
common
throughout
europe
inability
to
comprehend
and
believe
certain
religious
dogmas
was
a
crime
to
be
expiated
by
death
or
confiscation
of
estate
or
lingering
imprisonment
petty
offences
against
property
furnished
subjects
for
the
hangman
the
stocks
and
the
stood
by
the
side
of
the
tongues
were
bored
with
redhot
irons
and
ears
shorn
off
the
jails
were
loathsome
dungeons
swarming
with
vermin
unventilated
unwarmed
a
century
and
a
half
ago
the
populace
of
massachusetts
were
convulsed
with
grim
merriment
at
the
writhings
of
a
miserable
woman
scourged
at
the
or
strangling
in
the
stool
crowds
hastened
to
enjoy
the
spectacle
of
an
old
man
enduring
the
unutterable
torment
of
the
forte
et
dare
pressed
slowly
to
death
under
planks
for
refusing
to
plead
to
an
indictment
for
witchcraft
what
a
change
from
all
this
to
the
opening
of
the
state
reform
school
to
the
humane
regulations
of
prisons
and
penitentiaries
to
benevolence
watching
over
the
administration
of
justice
which
in
securing
society
from
lawless
aggression
is
not
suffered
to
overlook
the
true
interest
and
reformation
of
the
criminal
nor
to
forget
that
the
magistrate
in
the
words
of
the
apostle
is
to
be
indeed
the
minister
of
god
to
man
for
good
lord
ashley
and
the
thieves
they
that
be
whole
need
not
a
physician
but
they
that
are
sick
was
the
significant
answer
of
our
lord
to
the
pharisees
who
took
offence
at
his
companions
the
poor
the
degraded
the
weak
and
the
sinful
go
ye
and
learn
what
that
meaneth
i
will
have
mercy
and
not
sacrifice
for
i
am
not
come
to
call
the
righteous
but
sinners
to
repentance
the
great
lesson
of
duty
inculcated
by
this
answer
of
the
divine
teacher
has
been
too
long
overlooked
by
individuals
and
communities
professedly
governed
by
his
maxims
the
phylacteries
of
our
modern
pharisees
are
as
broad
as
those
of
the
old
jewish
saints
the
respectable
christian
detests
his
vicious
and
neighbors
as
heartily
as
the
israelite
did
the
publicans
and
sinners
of
his
day
he
folds
his
robe
of
closely
about
him
and
denounces
as
little
better
than
sinful
weakness
all
commiseration
for
the
guilty
and
all
attempts
to
restore
and
reclaim
the
erring
violators
of
human
law
otherwise
than
by
pains
and
penalties
as
wicked
collusion
with
crime
dangerous
to
the
stability
and
safety
of
society
and
offensive
in
the
sight
of
god
and
yet
nothing
is
more
certain
than
that
just
in
proportion
as
the
example
of
our
lord
has
been
followed
in
respect
to
the
outcast
and
criminal
the
effect
has
been
to
reform
and
elevate
to
snatch
as
brands
from
the
burning
souls
not
yet
wholly
given
over
to
the
service
of
evil
the
wonderful
influence
for
good
exerted
over
the
most
degraded
and
reckless
criminals
of
london
by
the
excellent
and
elizabeth
fry
the
happy
results
of
the
establishment
of
houses
of
refuge
and
reformation
and
magdalen
asylums
all
illustrate
the
wisdom
of
him
who
went
about
doing
good
in
pointing
out
the
morally
diseased
as
the
appropriate
subjects
of
the
benevolent
labors
of
his
disciples
no
one
is
to
be
despaired
of
we
have
no
warrant
to
pass
by
any
of
our
as
beyond
the
reach
of
god
grace
and
mercy
for
beneath
the
most
repulsive
and
hateful
outward
manifestation
there
is
always
a
consciousness
of
the
beauty
of
goodness
and
purity
and
of
the
loathsomeness
of
sin
one
chamber
of
the
heart
as
yet
not
wholly
profaned
whence
at
times
arises
the
prayer
of
a
burdened
and
miserable
spirit
for
deliverance
deep
down
under
the
squalid
exterior
unparticipative
in
the
hideous
merriment
and
recklessness
of
the
criminal
there
is
another
self
a
chained
and
suffering
inner
man
crying
out
in
the
intervals
of
intoxication
and
brutal
excesses
like
jonah
from
the
bosom
of
hell
to
this
lingering
consciousness
the
sympathy
and
kindness
of
benevolent
and
humane
spirits
seldom
appeal
in
vain
for
whatever
may
be
outward
appearances
it
remains
true
that
the
way
of
the
transgressor
is
hard
and
that
sin
and
suffering
are
inseparable
crime
is
seldom
loved
or
persevered
in
for
its
own
sake
but
when
once
the
evil
path
is
entered
upon
a
return
is
in
reality
extremely
difficult
to
the
unhappy
wanderer
and
often
seems
as
well
nigh
impossible
the
laws
of
social
life
rise
up
like
insurmountable
barriers
between
him
and
escape
as
he
turns
towards
the
society
whose
rights
he
has
outraged
its
frown
settles
upon
him
the
penalties
of
the
laws
he
has
violated
await
him
and
he
falls
back
despairing
and
suffers
the
fetters
of
the
evil
habit
to
whose
power
he
has
yielded
himself
to
be
fastened
closer
and
heavier
upon
him
o
for
some
good
angel
in
the
form
of
a
and
touched
with
a
feeling
of
his
sins
and
infirmities
to
reassure
his
better
nature
and
to
point
out
a
way
of
escape
from
its
body
of
death
we
have
been
led
into
these
remarks
by
an
account
given
in
the
london
weekly
chronicle
of
a
most
remarkable
interview
between
the
professional
thieves
of
london
and
lord
ashley
a
gentleman
whose
best
patent
of
nobility
is
to
be
found
in
his
generous
and
untiring
devotion
to
the
interests
of
his
it
appears
that
a
philanthropic
gentleman
in
london
had
been
applied
to
by
two
young
thieves
who
had
relinquished
their
evil
practices
and
were
obtaining
a
precarious
but
honest
livelihood
by
picking
up
bones
and
rags
in
the
streets
their
loss
of
character
closing
against
them
all
other
employments
he
had
just
been
reading
an
address
of
lord
ashley
in
favor
of
colonial
emigration
and
he
was
led
to
ask
one
of
the
young
men
how
he
would
like
to
emigrate
i
should
jump
at
the
chance
was
the
reply
not
long
after
the
gentleman
was
sent
for
to
visit
one
of
those
obscure
and
ruinous
courts
of
the
great
metropolis
where
crime
and
poverty
lie
down
together
localities
which
dickens
has
pictured
with
such
painful
distinctness
here
to
his
surprise
he
met
a
number
of
thieves
and
outlaws
who
declared
themselves
extremely
anxious
to
know
whether
any
hope
could
be
held
out
to
them
of
obtaining
an
honest
living
however
humble
in
the
colonies
as
their
only
reason
for
continuing
in
their
criminal
course
was
the
impossibility
of
extricating
themselves
he
gave
them
such
advice
and
encouragement
as
he
was
able
and
invited
them
to
assemble
again
with
such
of
their
companions
as
they
could
persuade
to
do
so
at
the
room
of
the
irish
free
school
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
lord
ashley
on
the
of
the
seventh
month
last
the
meeting
took
place
at
the
hour
appointed
lord
ashley
and
five
or
six
other
benevolent
gentlemen
interested
in
emigration
as
a
means
of
relief
and
reformation
to
the
criminal
poor
entered
the
room
which
was
already
filled
two
hundred
and
seven
professed
thieves
were
present
several
of
the
most
experienced
thieves
were
stationed
at
the
door
to
prevent
the
admission
of
any
but
thieves
some
four
or
five
individuals
who
were
not
at
first
known
were
subjected
to
examination
and
only
allowed
to
remain
on
stating
that
they
were
and
being
recognized
as
members
of
the
dishonest
fraternity
and
before
the
proceedings
of
the
evening
commenced
the
question
was
very
carefully
put
and
repeated
several
times
whether
any
one
was
in
the
room
of
whom
others
entertained
doubts
as
to
who
he
was
the
object
of
this
care
was
as
so
many
of
them
were
in
danger
of
into
trouble
or
in
other
words
of
being
taken
up
for
their
crimes
to
ascertain
if
any
who
might
betray
them
were
present
and
another
intention
of
this
scrutiny
was
to
give
those
assembled
who
naturally
would
feel
considerable
fear
a
fuller
confidence
in
opening
their
minds
what
a
novel
conference
between
the
extremes
of
modern
society
all
that
is
beautiful
in
refinement
and
education
moral
symmetry
and
christian
grace
contrasting
with
the
squalor
the
ignorance
the
lifelong
depravity
of
men
living
without
god
in
the
world
the
pariahs
of
civilization
the
moral
lepers
at
the
sight
of
whom
decency
covers
its
face
and
cries
out
unclean
after
a
prayer
had
been
offered
lord
ashley
spoke
at
considerable
length
making
a
profound
impression
on
his
strange
auditory
as
they
listened
to
his
plans
of
emigration
which
offered
them
an
opportunity
to
escape
from
their
miserable
condition
and
enter
upon
a
respectable
course
of
life
the
hard
heart
melted
and
the
cold
and
cruel
eye
moistened
with
one
accord
the
wretched
felons
responded
to
the
language
of
christian
love
and
and
declared
their
readiness
to
follow
the
advice
of
their
true
friend
they
looked
up
to
him
as
to
an
angel
of
mercy
and
felt
the
malignant
spirits
which
had
so
long
tormented
them
disarmed
of
all
power
of
evil
in
the
presence
of
simple
goodness
he
stood
in
that
felon
audience
like
spenser
una
amidst
the
satyrs
unassailable
and
secure
in
the
unresistible
might
of
meekness
and
panoplied
in
that
noble
grace
which
dashed
brute
violence
with
sudden
adoration
and
mute
awe
twenty
years
ago
when
elizabeth
fry
ventured
to
visit
those
spirits
in
prison
the
female
tenants
of
newgate
her
temerity
was
regarded
with
astonishment
and
her
hope
of
effecting
a
reformation
in
the
miserable
objects
of
her
sympathy
was
held
to
be
wholly
visionary
her
personal
safety
and
the
blessed
fruits
of
her
labors
nevertheless
confirmed
the
language
of
her
divine
master
to
his
disciples
when
he
sent
them
forth
as
lambs
among
wolves
behold
i
give
unto
you
power
over
all
the
power
of
the
enemy
the
still
more
unpromising
experiment
of
lord
ashley
thus
far
has
been
equally
successful
and
we
hail
it
as
the
introduction
of
a
new
and
more
humane
method
of
dealing
with
the
victims
of
sin
and
ignorance
and
the
temptations
growing
out
of
the
inequalities
and
vices

woman
suffrage
letter
to
the
newport
convention
amesbury
month
i
have
received
thy
letter
inviting
me
to
attend
the
convention
in
behalf
of
woman
suffrage
at
newport
on
the
inst
i
do
not
see
how
it
is
possible
for
me
to
accept
the
invitation
and
were
i
to
do
so
the
state
of
my
health
would
prevent
me
from
taking
such
a
part
in
the
meeting
as
would
relieve
me
from
the
responsibility
of
seeming
to
sanction
anything
in
its
action
which
might
conflict
with
my
own
views
of
duty
or
policy
yet
i
should
do
myself
great
injustice
if
i
did
not
embrace
this
occasion
to
express
my
general
sympathy
with
the
movement
i
have
seen
no
good
reason
why
mothers
wives
and
daughters
should
not
have
the
same
right
of
person
property
and
citizenship
which
fathers
husbands
and
brothers
have
the
sacred
memory
of
mother
and
sister
the
wisdom
and
dignity
of
women
of
my
own
religious
communion
who
have
been
accustomed
to
something
like
equality
in
rights
as
well
as
duties
my
experience
as
a
with
noble
and
women
as
graceful
and
helpful
in
their
household
duties
as
firm
and
courageous
in
their
public
advocacy
of
unpopular
truth
the
steady
friendships
which
have
inspired
and
strengthened
me
and
the
reverence
and
respect
which
i
feel
for
human
nature
irrespective
of
sex
compel
me
to
look
with
something
more
than
acquiescence
on
the
efforts
you
are
making
i
frankly
confess
that
i
am
not
able
to
forsee
all
the
consequences
of
the
great
social
and
political
change
proposed
but
of
this
i
am
at
least
sure
it
is
always
safe
to
do
right
and
the
truest
expediency
is
simple
justice
i
can
understand
without
sharing
the
misgivings
of
those
who
fear
that
when
the
vote
drops
from
woman
hand
into
the
the
beauty
and
sentiment
the
bloom
and
sweetness
of
womankind
will
go
with
it
but
in
this
matter
it
seems
to
me
that
we
can
trust
nature
stronger
than
statutes
or
conventions
she
will
be
conservative
of
all
that
the
true
man
loves
and
honors
in
woman
here
and
there
may
be
found
an
equivocal
unsexed
chevalier
but
the
eternal
order
and
fitness
of
things
will
remain
i
have
no
fear
that
man
will
be
less
manly
or
woman
less
womanly
when
they
meet
on
terms
of
equality
before
the
law
on
the
other
hand
i
do
not
see
that
the
exercise
of
the
ballot
by
woman
will
prove
a
remedy
for
all
the
evils
of
which
she
justly
complains
it
is
her
right
as
truly
as
mine
and
when
she
asks
for
it
it
is
something
less
than
manhood
to
withhold
it
but
unsupported
by
a
more
practical
education
higher
aims
and
a
deeper
sense
of
the
responsibilities
of
life
and
duty
it
is
not
likely
to
prove
a
blessing
in
her
hands
any
more
than
in
man
with
great
respect
and
hearty
sympathy
i
am
very
truly
thy
friend
italian
unity
amesbury
read
at
the
great
meeting
in
new
york
january
in
celebration
of
the
freedom
of
rome
and
complete
unity
of
italy
it
would
give
me
more
than
ordinary
satisfaction
to
attend
the
meeting
on
the
instant
for
the
celebration
of
italian
unity
the
emancipation
of
rome
and
its
occupation
as
the
permanent
capital
of
the
nation
for
many
years
i
have
watched
with
deep
interest
and
sympathy
the
popular
movement
on
the
italian
peninsula
and
especially
every
effort
for
the
deliverance
of
rome
from
a
despotism
counting
its
age
by
centuries
i
looked
at
these
struggles
of
the
people
with
little
reference
to
their
ecclesiastical
or
sectarian
bearings
had
i
been
a
catholic
instead
of
a
protestant
i
should
have
hailed
every
symptom
of
roman
deliverance
from
papal
rule
occupying
as
i
have
the
standpoint
of
a
republican
radical
desirous
that
all
men
of
all
creeds
should
enjoy
the
civil
liberty
which
i
prized
so
highly
for
myself
i
lost
all
confidence
in
the
french
republic
of
when
it
forfeited
its
own
right
to
exist
by
crushing
out
the
newly
formed
roman
republic
under
mazzini
and
garibaldi
from
that
hour
it
was
doomed
and
the
expiation
of
its
monstrous
crime
is
still
going
on
my
sympathies
are
with
jules
favre
and
leon
gambetta
in
their
efforts
to
establish
and
sustain
a
republic
in
france
but
i
confess
that
the
investment
of
paris
by
king
william
seems
to
me
the
logical
sequence
of
the
bombardment
of
rome
by
oudinot
and
is
it
not
a
significant
fact
that
the
terrible
chassepot
which
made
its
first
bloody
experiment
upon
the
halfarmed
italian
patriots
without
the
walls
of
rome
has
failed
in
the
hands
of
french
republicans
against
the
inferior
of
prussia
it
was
said
of
a
fierce
actor
in
the
old
french
revolution
that
he
demoralized
the
guillotine
the
massacre
at
mentana
demoralized
the
chassepot
it
is
a
matter
of
congratulation
that
the
redemption
of
rome
has
been
effected
so
easily
and
bloodlessly
the
despotism
of
a
thousand
years
fell
at
a
touch
in
noiseless
rottenness
the
people
of
rome
fifty
to
one
cast
their
ballots
of
condemnation
like
so
many
shovelfuls
of
earth
upon
its
grave
outside
of
rome
there
seems
to
be
a
very
general
acquiescence
in
its
downfall
no
peter
the
hermit
preaches
a
crusade
in
its
behalf
no
one
of
the
great
catholic
powers
of
europe
lifts
a
finger
for
it
whatever
may
be
the
feelings
of
isabella
of
spain
and
the
fugitive
son
of
king
bomba
they
are
in
no
condition
to
come
to
its
rescue
it
is
reserved
for
american
ecclesiastics
in
professions
of
democracy
to
make
solemn
protest
against
what
they
call
an
outrage
which
gives
the
people
of
rome
the
right
of
choosing
their
own
government
and
denies
the
divine
right
of
kings
in
the
person
of
pio
nono
the
withdrawal
of
the
temporal
power
of
the
pope
will
prove
a
blessing
to
the
catholic
church
as
well
as
to
the
world
many
of
its
most
learned
and
devout
priests
and
laymen
have
long
seen
the
necessity
of
such
a
change
which
takes
from
it
a
reproach
and
scandal
that
could
no
longer
be
excused
or
tolerated
a
century
hence
it
will
have
as
few
apologists
as
the
inquisition
or
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
in
this
hour
of
congratulation
let
us
not
forget
those
whose
suffering
and
in
the
inscrutable
wisdom
of
providence
prepared
the
way
for
the
triumph
which
we
celebrate
as
we
call
the
long
illustrious
roll
of
italian
patriotism
the
young
the
brave
and
beautiful
the
saintly
confessors
the
scholars
poets
artists
who
shut
out
from
human
sympathy
gave
their
lives
for
god
and
country
in
the
slow
dumb
agony
of
prison
martyrdom
let
us
hope
that
they
also
rejoice
with
us
and
inaudible
to
earthly
ears
unite
in
our
thanksgiving
alleluia
for
the
lord
god
omnipotent
reigneth
he
hath
avenged
the
blood
of
his
servants
in
the
belief
that
the
unity
of
italy
and
the
overthrow
of
papal
rule
will
strengthen
the
cause
of
liberty
throughout
the
civilized
world
i
am
very
truly
thy
friend
indian
civilization
the
present
condition
and
future
prospects
of
the
remnants
of
the
aboriginal
inhabitants
of
this
continent
can
scarcely
be
a
matter
of
indifference
to
any
class
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
apart
from
all
considerations
of
justice
and
duty
a
purely
selfish
regard
to
our
own
would
compel
attention
to
the
subject
the
irreversible
laws
of
god
moral
government
and
the
maxims
of
political
and
social
economy
leave
us
in
no
doubt
that
the
suffering
neglect
and
wrong
of
one
part
of
the
community
must
affect
all
others
a
common
responsibility
rests
upon
each
and
all
to
relieve
suffering
enlighten
ignorance
and
redress
wrong
and
the
penalty
of
neglect
in
this
respect
no
nation
has
ever
escaped
it
is
only
within
a
comparatively
recent
period
that
the
term
indian
civilization
could
be
appropriately
used
in
this
country
very
little
real
progress
bad
been
made
in
this
direction
up
to
the
time
when
commissioner
lang
in
visited
the
tribes
now
most
advanced
so
little
had
been
done
that
public
opinion
had
acquiesced
in
the
assumption
that
the
indians
were
not
susceptible
of
civilization
and
progress
the
few
experiments
had
not
been
calculated
to
assure
a
superficial
observer
the
unsupported
efforts
of
elliot
in
new
england
were
counteracted
by
the
imprisonment
and
in
some
instances
the
massacre
of
his
praying
indians
by
white
men
under
the
exasperation
of
war
with
hostile
tribes
the
salutary
influence
of
the
moravians
and
friends
in
pennsylvania
was
greatly
weakened
by
the
dreadful
massacre
of
the
unarmed
and
blameless
converts
of
gnadenhutten
but
since
the
first
visit
of
commissioner
lang
years
ago
the
progress
of
education
civilization
and
conversion
to
christianity
has
been
of
a
most
encouraging
nature
and
if
indian
civilization
was
ever
a
doubtful
problem
it
has
been
practically
solved
the
nomadic
habits
and
warlike
propensities
of
the
native
tribes
are
indeed
formidable
but
not
insuperable
difficulties
in
the
way
of
their
elevation
the
wildest
of
them
may
compare
not
unfavorably
with
those
northern
barbarian
hordes
that
swooped
down
upon
christian
europe
and
who
were
so
soon
the
docile
pupils
and
proselytes
of
the
peoples
they
had
conquered
the
arapahoes
and
camanches
of
our
day
are
no
further
removed
from
the
sweetness
and
light
of
christian
culture
than
were
the
scandinavian
sea
kings
of
the
middle
centuries
whose
gods
were
patrons
of
rapine
and
cruelty
their
heaven
a
vast
where
ghostly
warriors
drank
from
the
skulls
of
their
victims
and
whose
hell
was
a
frozen
horror
of
desolation
and
darkness
to
be
avoided
only
by
diligence
in
robbery
and
courage
in
murder
the
descendants
of
these
human
butchers
are
now
among
the
best
exponents
of
the
humanizing
influence
of
the
gospel
of
christ
the
report
of
the
superintendent
of
the
remnants
of
the
once
fierce
and
warlike
six
nations
now
peaceable
and
prosperous
in
canada
shows
that
the
indian
is
not
inferior
to
the
norse
ancestors
of
the
danes
and
norwegians
of
our
day
in
capability
of
improvement
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
what
is
universally
conceded
that
the
wars
waged
by
the
indians
against
the
whites
have
in
nearly
every
instance
been
provoked
by
violations
of
solemn
treaties
and
systematic
disregard
of
their
rights
of
person
property
and
life
the
letter
of
bishop
whipple
of
minnesota
to
the
new
york
tribune
of
second
month
calls
attention
to
the
emphatic
language
of
generals
sherman
harney
terry
and
augur
written
after
a
full
and
searching
investigation
of
the
subject
that
the
indian
goes
to
war
is
not
astonishing
he
is
often
compelled
to
do
so
wrongs
are
borne
by
him
in
silence
which
never
fail
to
drive
civilized
men
to
deeds
of
violence
the
best
possible
way
to
avoid
war
is
to
do
no
injustice
it
is
not
difficult
to
understand
the
feelings
of
the
unfortunate
pioneer
settlers
on
the
extreme
borders
of
civilization
upon
whom
the
blind
vengeance
of
the
wronged
and
hunted
indians
falls
oftener
than
upon
the
real
they
point
to
terrible
and
revolting
cruelties
as
proof
that
nothing
short
of
the
absolute
extermination
of
the
race
can
prevent
their
repetition
but
a
moment
consideration
compels
us
to
admit
that
atrocious
cruelty
is
not
peculiar
to
the
red
man
all
wars
are
cruel
said
general
sherman
and
for
eighteen
centuries
christendom
has
been
a
great
what
indian
raid
has
been
more
dreadful
than
the
sack
of
magdeburg
the
massacre
of
glencoe
the
nameless
atrocities
of
the
duke
of
alva
in
the
netherlands
the
murders
of
bartholomew
day
the
unspeakable
agonies
of
the
south
of
france
under
the
demoniac
rule
of
revolution
all
history
black
with
crime
and
red
with
blood
is
but
an
awful
commentary
upon
man
inhumanity
to
man
and
it
teaches
us
that
there
is
nothing
exceptional
in
the
ferocity
and
vindictiveness
and
that
the
alleged
reasons
for
his
extermination
would
at
one
time
or
another
have
applied
with
equal
force
to
the
whole
family
of
man
a
late
lecture
of
my
friend
stanley
pumphrey
comprises
more
of
valuable
information
and
pertinent
suggestions
on
the
indian
question
than
i
have
found
in
any
equal
space
and
i
am
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
add
to
it
my
hearty
endorsement
and
to
express
the
conviction
that
its
general
circulation
could
not
fail
to
awaken
a
deeper
and
more
kindly
interest
in
the
condition
of
the
red
man
and
greatly
aid
in
leading
the
public
mind
to
a
fuller
appreciation
of
the
responsibility
which
rests
upon
us
as
a
people
to
rectify
as
far
as
possible
past
abuses
and
in
our
future
relations
to
the
native
owners
of
the
soil
to
deal
justly
and
love
mercy
reading
for
the
blind
to
mary
moore
teacher
in
the
perkins
asylum
dear
friend
it
gives
me
great
pleasure
to
know
that
the
pupils
in
thy
class
at
the
institution
for
the
blind
have
the
opportunity
afforded
them
to
read
through
the
sense
of
touch
some
of
my
writings
and
thus
hold
what
i
hope
will
prove
a
pleasant
communion
with
me
very
glad
i
shall
be
if
the
of
nature
and
homely
country
firesides
which
i
have
tried
to
make
are
understood
and
appreciated
by
those
who
can
not
discern
them
by
natural
vision
i
shall
count
it
a
great
privilege
to
see
for
them
or
rather
to
let
them
see
through
my
eyes
it
is
the
mind
after
all
that
really
sees
shapes
and
colors
all
things
what
visions
of
beauty
and
sublimity
passed
before
the
inward
and
spiritual
sight
of
blind
milton
and
beethoven
i
have
an
esteemed
friend
morrison
hendy
of
kentucky
who
is
deaf
and
blind
yet
under
these
circumstances
he
has
cultivated
his
mind
to
a
high
degree
and
has
written
poems
of
great
beauty
and
vivid
descriptions
of
scenes
which
have
been
witnessed
only
by
the
light
within
i
thank
thee
for
thy
letter
and
beg
of
thee
to
assure
the
students
that
i
am
deeply
interested
in
their
welfare
and
progress
and
that
my
prayer
is
that
their
inward
and
spiritual
eyes
may
become
so
clear
that
they
can
well
dispense
with
the
outward
and
material
ones
the
indian
question
read
at
the
meeting
in
boston
may
for
the
consideration
of
the
condition
of
the
indians
in
the
united
states
amesbury
i
regret
that
i
can
not
be
present
at
the
meeting
called
in
reference
to
the
pressing
question
of
the
day
the
present
condition
and
future
prospects
of
the
indian
race
in
the
united
states
the
old
policy
however
well
intended
of
the
government
is
no
longer
available
the
westward
setting
tide
of
immigration
is
everywhere
sweeping
over
the
lines
of
the
reservations
there
would
seem
to
be
no
power
in
the
government
to
prevent
the
practical
abrogation
of
its
solemn
treaties
and
the
crowding
out
of
the
indians
from
their
guaranteed
hunting
grounds
outbreaks
of
indian
ferocity
and
revenge
incited
by
wrong
and
robbery
on
the
part
of
the
whites
will
increasingly
be
made
the
pretext
of
indiscriminate
massacres
the
entire
question
will
soon
resolve
itself
into
the
single
alternative
of
education
and
civilization
or
extermination
the
school
experiments
at
hampton
carlisle
and
forest
grove
in
oregon
have
proved
if
such
proof
were
ever
needed
that
the
roving
indian
can
be
enlightened
and
civilized
taught
to
work
and
take
interest
and
delight
in
the
product
of
his
industry
and
settle
down
on
his
farm
or
in
his
workshop
as
an
american
citizen
protected
by
and
subject
to
the
laws
of
the
republic
what
is
needed
is
that
not
only
these
schools
should
be
more
liberally
supported
but
that
new
ones
should
be
opened
without
delay
the
matter
does
not
admit
of
procrastination
the
work
of
education
and
civilization
must
be
done
the
money
needed
must
be
contributed
with
no
sparing
hand
the
laudable
example
set
by
the
friends
and
the
american
missionary
association
should
be
followed
by
other
sects
and
philanthropic
societies
christianity
patriotism
and
enlightened
self
interest
have
a
common
stake
in
the
matter
great
and
difficult
as
the
work
may
be
the
country
is
strong
enough
rich
enough
wise
enough
and
i
believe
humane
and
christian
enough
to
do
it
the
republican
party
read
at
a
meeting
of
the
essex
club
in
boston
november
amesbury
i
am
sorry
that
i
can
not
accept
thy
invitation
to
attend
the
meeting
of
the
essex
club
on
the
inst
i
should
be
glad
to
meet
my
old
republican
friends
and
congratulate
them
on
the
results
of
the
election
in
massachusetts
and
especially
in
our
good
old
county
of
essex
some
of
our
friends
and
neighbors
who
have
been
with
us
heretofore
last
year
saw
fit
to
vote
with
the
opposite
party
i
would
be
the
last
to
deny
their
perfect
right
to
do
so
or
to
impeach
their
motives
but
i
think
they
were
mistaken
in
expecting
that
party
to
reform
the
abuses
and
evils
which
they
complained
of
president
cleveland
has
proved
himself
better
than
his
party
and
has
done
and
said
some
good
things
which
i
give
him
full
credit
for
but
the
instincts
of
his
party
are
against
him
and
must
eventually
prove
too
strong
for
him
and
instead
of
his
carrying
the
party
it
will
be
likely
to
carry
him
it
has
already
compelled
him
to
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
for
electioneering
purposes
and
travel
all
the
way
from
washington
to
buffalo
to
give
his
vote
for
a
spoilsman
and
service
machine
politician
i
would
not
like
to
call
it
a
case
of
offensive
partisanship
but
it
looks
a
good
deal
like
it
as
a
republican
from
the
outset
i
am
proud
of
the
noble
record
of
the
party
but
i
should
rejoice
to
see
its
beneficent
work
taken
up
by
the
democratic
party
and
so
faithfully
carried
on
as
to
make
our
organization
no
longer
necessary
but
as
far
as
we
can
see
the
republican
party
has
still
its
mission
and
its
future
when
labor
shall
everywhere
have
its
just
reward
and
the
gains
of
it
are
made
secure
to
the
earners
when
education
shall
be
universal
and
north
and
south
all
men
shall
have
the
free
and
full
enjoyment
of
civil
rights
and
privileges
irrespective
of
color
or
former
condition
when
every
vice
which
debases
the
community
shall
be
discouraged
and
prohibited
and
every
virtue
which
elevates
it
fostered
and
strengthened
when
merit
and
fitness
shall
be
the
conditions
of
office
and
when
sectional
distrust
and
prejudice
shall
give
place
to
confidence
in
the
loyalty
and
patriotism
of
all
then
will
the
work
of
the
republican
party
as
a
party
be
ended
and
all
political
rivalries
be
merged
in
the
one
great
party
of
the
people
with
no
other
aim
than
the
common
welfare
and
no
other
watchwords
than
peace
liberty
and
union
then
may
the
language
which
milton
addressed
to
his
countrymen
two
centuries
ago
be
applied
to
the
united
states
go
on
hand
in
hand
o
peoples
never
to
be
disunited
be
the
praise
and
heroic
song
of
all
posterity
join
your
invincible
might
to
do
worthy
and
godlike
deeds
and
then
he
who
seeks
to
break
your
union
a
cleaving
curse
be
his
inheritance
our
dumb
relations
it
was
said
of
francis
of
assisi
that
he
had
attained
through
the
fervor
of
his
love
the
secret
of
that
deep
amity
with
god
and
his
creation
which
in
the
language
of
inspiration
makes
man
to
be
in
league
with
the
stones
of
the
field
and
the
beasts
of
the
field
to
be
at
peace
with
him
the
world
has
never
been
without
tender
souls
with
whom
the
golden
rule
has
a
broader
application
than
its
letter
might
seem
to
warrant
the
ancient
eastern
seers
recognized
the
rights
of
the
brute
creation
and
regarded
the
unnecessary
taking
of
the
life
of
the
humblest
and
meanest
as
a
sin
and
in
almost
all
the
old
religions
of
the
world
there
are
legends
of
saints
in
the
depth
of
whose
peace
with
god
and
nature
all
life
was
sacredly
regarded
as
the
priceless
gift
of
heaven
and
who
were
thus
enabled
to
dwell
safely
amidst
lions
and
serpents
it
is
creditable
to
human
nature
and
its
unperverted
instincts
that
stories
and
anecdotes
of
reciprocal
kindness
and
affection
between
men
and
animals
are
always
listened
to
with
interest
and
approval
how
pleasant
to
think
of
the
arab
and
his
horse
whose
friendship
has
been
celebrated
in
song
and
romance
of
vogelwied
the
minnesinger
and
his
bequest
to
the
birds
of
the
english
quaker
visited
wherever
he
went
by
flocks
of
birds
who
with
cries
of
joy
alighted
on
his
hat
and
his
drab
of
old
samuel
johnson

and
infirm

of
an
evening
for
oysters
for
his
cat
of
walter

and
john
brown
of
edinburgh
and
their
dogs
of
our
own
thoreau
instinctively
recognized
by
bird
and
beast
as
a
friend
emerson
says
of
him
his
intimacy
with
animals
suggested
what
thomas
fuller
records
of
butler
the
apologist
that
either
he
had
told
the
bees
things
or
the
bees
had
told
him
snakes
coiled
round
his
legs
the
fishes
swam
into
his
hand
he
pulled
the
woodchuck
out
of
his
hole
by
his
tail
and
took
foxes
under
his
protection
from
the
hunters
in
the
greatest
of
the
ancient
hindu
poems
the
sacred
book
of
the
mahabharata
there
is
a
passage
of
exceptional
beauty
and
tenderness
which
records
the
reception
of
king
yudishthira
at
the
gate
of
paradise
a
pilgrim
to
the
heavenly
city
the
king
had
travelled
over
vast
spaces
and
one
by
one
the
loved
ones
the
companions
of
his
journey
had
all
fallen
and
left
him
alone
save
his
faithful
dog
which
still
followed
he
was
met
by
indra
and
invited
to
enter
the
holy
city
but
the
king
thinks
of
his
friends
who
have
fallen
on
the
way
and
declines
to
go
in
without
them
the
god
tells
him
they
are
all
within
waiting
for
him
joyful
he
is
about
to
seek
them
when
he
looks
upon
the
poor
dog
who
weary
and
wasted
crouches
at
his
feet
and
asks
that
he
too
may
enter
the
gate
indra
refuses
and
thereupon
the
king
declares
that
to
abandon
his
faithful
dumb
friend
would
be
as
great
a
sin
as
to
kill
a
brahmin
away
with
that
felicity
whose
price
is
to
abandon
the
faithful
never
come
weal
or
woe
will
i
leave
my
faithful
dog
the
poor
creature
in
fear
and
distress
has
trusted
in
my
power
to
save
him
not
therefore
for
life
itself
will
i
break
my
plighted
word
in

of
heaven
he
chooses
to
go
to
hell
with
his
dog
and
straightway
descends
as
he
supposes
thither
but
his
virtue
and
faithfulness
change
his
destination
to
heaven
and
he
finds
himself
surrounded
by
his
old

his

international
arbitration
read
at
the
reception
in
boston
of
the
english
delegation
representing
more
than
two
hundred
members
of
the
british
parliament
who
favor
international
arbitration
amesbury
it
is
a
very
serious
disappointment
to
me
not
to
be
able
to
be
present
at
the
welcome
of
the
american
peace
society
to
the
delegation
of
more
than
two
hundred
members
of
the
british
parliament
who
favor
international
arbitration
few
events
have
more
profoundly
impressed
me
than
the
presentation
of
this
peaceful
overture
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
it
seems
to
me
that
every
true
patriot
who
seeks
the
best
interests
of
his
country
and
every
believer
in
the
gospel
of
christ
must
respond
to
the
admirable
address
of
sir
lyon
playfair
and
that
of
his
colleagues
who
represented
the
workingmen
of
england
we
do
not
need
to
be
told
that
war
is
always
cruel
barbarous
and
brutal
whether
used
by
professed
christians
with
ball
and
bayonet
or
by
heathen
with
club
and
boomerang
we
can
not
be
blind
to
its
waste
of
life
and
treasure
and
the
demoralization
which
follows
in
its
train
nor
cease
to
wonder
at
the
spectacle
of
christian
nations
exhausting
all
their
resources
in
preparing
to
slaughter
each
other
with
only
here
and
there
a
voice
like
count
tolstoi
in
the
russian
wilderness
crying
in
heedless
ears
that
the
gospel
of
christ
is
peace
not
war
and
love
not
hatred
the
overture
which
comes
to
us
from
english
advocates
of
arbitration
is
a
cheering
assurance
that
the
tide
of
sentiment
is
turning
in
favor
of
peace
among
english
speaking
peoples
i
can
not
doubt
that
whatever
stump
orators
and
newspapers
may
say
for
party
purposes
the
heart
of
america
will
respond
to
the
generous
proposal
of
our
kinsfolk
across
the
water
no
two
nations
could
be
more
favorably
conditioned
than
england
and
the
united
states
for
making
the
holy
experiment
of
arbitration
in
our
associations
and
kinship
our
aims
and
interests
our
common
claims
in
the
great
names
and
achievements
of
a
common
ancestry
we
are
essentially
one
people
whatever
other
nations
may
do
we
at
least
should
be
friends
god
grant
that
the
noble
and
generous
attempt
shall
not
be
in
vain
may
it
hasten
the
time
when
the
only
rivalry
between
us
shall
be
the
peaceful
rivalry
of
progress
and
the
gracious
interchange
of
good
when
closer
strand
shall
lean
to
strand
till
meet
beneath
saluting
flags
the
eagle
of
our
mountain
crags

lion

suffrage
for

at
the
woman
convention
at
washington
oak
knoll
danvers
third
i
thank
thee
for
thy
kind
letter
it
would
be
a
great
satisfaction
to
be
able
to
be
present
at
the
fortieth
anniversary
of
the
woman
suffrage
association
but
as
that
is
not
possible
i
can
only
reiterate
my
hearty
sympathy
with
the
object
of
the
association
and
bid
it
take
heart
and
assurance
in
view
of
all
that
has
been
accomplished
there
is
no
easy
royal
road
to
a
reform
of
this
kind
but
if
the
progress
has
been
slow
there
has
been
no
step
backward
the
barriers
which
at
first
seemed
impregnable
in
the
shape
of
custom
and
prejudice
have
been
undermined
and
their
fall
is
certain
a
prophecy
of
your
triumph
at
no
distant
day
is
in
the
air
your
opponents
feel
it
and
believe
it
they
know
that
yours
is
a
gaining
and
theirs
a
losing
cause
the
work
still
before
you
demands
on
your
part
great
patience
steady
perseverance
a
firm
dignified
and
protest
against
the
injustice
of
which
you
have
so
much
reason
to
complain
and
of
serene
confidence
which
is
not
discouraged
by
temporary
checks
nor
embittered
by
hostile
criticism
nor
provoked
to
use
any
weapons
of
retort
which
like
the
boomerang
fall
back
on
the
heads
of
those
who
use
them
you
can
afford
in
your
consciousness
of
right
to
be
as
calm
and
courteous
as
the
archangel
michael
who
we
are
told
in
scripture
in
his
controversy
with
satan
himself
did
not
bring
a
railing
accusation
against
him
a
wise
adaptation
of
means
to
ends
is
no
yielding
of
principle
but
care
should
be
taken
to
avoid
all
such
methods
as
have
disgraced
political
and
religious
parties
of
the
masculine
sex
continue
to
make
it
manifest
that
all
which
is
pure
and
lovely
and
of
good
repute
in
womanhood
is
entirely
compatible
with
the
exercise
of
the
rights
of
citizenship
and
the
performance
of
the
duties
which
we
all
owe
to
our
homes
and
our
country
confident
that
you
will
do
this
and
with
no
doubt
or
misgiving
as
to
your
success
i
bid
you
godspeed
i
find
i
have
written
to
the
association
rather
than
to
thyself
but
as
one
of
the
principal
originators
and
most
faithful
supporters
it
was
very
natural
that
i
should
identify
thee
with
it
