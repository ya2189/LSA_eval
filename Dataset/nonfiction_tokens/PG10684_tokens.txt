freedom
of
thought
and
the
forces
against
it
introductory
it
is
a
common
saying
that
thought
is
free
a
man
can
never
be
hindered
from
thinking
whatever
he
chooses
so
long
as
he
conceals
what
he
thinks
the
working
of
his
mind
is
limited
only
by
the
bounds
of
his
experience
and
the
power
of
his
imagination
but
this
natural
liberty
of
private
thinking
is
of
little
value
it
is
unsatisfactory
and
even
painful
to
the
thinker
himself
if
he
is
not
permitted
to
communicate
his
thoughts
to
others
and
it
is
obviously
of
no
value
to
his
neighbours
moreover
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
hide
thoughts
that
have
any
power
over
the
mind
if
a
thinking
leads
him
to
call
in
question
ideas
and
customs
which
regulate
the
behaviour
of
those
about
him
to
reject
beliefs
which
they
hold
to
see
better
ways
of
life
than
those
they
follow
it
is
almost
impossible
for
him
if
he
is
convinced
of
the
truth
of
his
own
reasoning
not
to
betray
by
silence
chance
words
or
general
attitude
that
he
is
different
from
them
and
does
not
share
their
opinions
some
have
preferred
like
socrates
some
would
prefer
to
face
death
rather
than
conceal
their
thoughts
thus
freedom
of
thought
in
any
valuable
sense
includes
freedom
of
speech
at
present
in
the
most
civilized
countries
freedom
of
speech
is
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
and
seems
a
perfectly
simple
thing
we
are
so
accustomed
to
it
that
we
look
on
it
as
a
natural
right
but
this
right
has
been
acquired
only
in
quite
recent
times
and
the
way
to
its
attainment
has
lain
through
lakes
of
blood
it
has
taken
centuries
to
persuade
the
most
enlightened
peoples
that
liberty
to
publish
opinions
and
to
discuss
all
questions
is
a
good
and
not
a
bad
thing
human
societies
there
are
some
brilliant
exceptions
have
been
generally
opposed
to
freedom
of
thought
or
in
other
words
to
new
ideas
and
it
is
easy
to
see
why
the
average
brain
is
naturally
lazy
and
tends
to
take
the
line
of
least
resistance
the
mental
world
of
the
ordinary
man
consists
of
beliefs
which
he
has
accepted
without
questioning
and
to
which
he
is
firmly
attached
he
is
instinctively
hostile
to
anything
which
would
upset
the
established
order
of
this
familiar
world
a
new
idea
inconsistent
with
some
of
the
beliefs
which
he
holds
means
the
necessity
of
rearranging
his
mind
and
this
process
is
laborious
requiring
a
painful
expenditure
of
to
him
and
his
fellows
who
form
the
vast
majority
new
ideas
and
opinions
which
cast
doubt
on
established
beliefs
and
institutions
seem
evil
because
they
are
disagreeable
the
repugnance
due
to
mere
mental
laziness
is
increased
by
a
positive
feeling
of
fear
the
conservative
instinct
hardens
into
the
conservative
doctrine
that
the
foundations
of
society
are
endangered
by
any
alterations
in
the
structure
it
is
only
recently
that
men
have
been
abandoning
the
belief
that
the
welfare
of
a
state
depends
on
rigid
stability
and
on
the
preservation
of
its
traditions
and
institutions
unchanged
wherever
that
belief
prevails
novel
opinions
are
felt
to
be
dangerous
as
well
as
annoying
and
any
one
who
asks
inconvenient
questions
about
the
why
and
the
wherefore
of
accepted
principles
is
considered
a
pestilent
person
the
conservative
instinct
and
the
conservative
doctrine
which
is
its
consequence
are
strengthened
by
superstition
if
the
social
structure
including
the
whole
body
of
customs
and
opinions
is
associated
intimately
with
religious
belief
and
is
supposed
to
be
under
divine
patronage
criticism
of
the
social
order
savours
of
impiety
while
criticism
of
the
religious
belief
is
a
direct
challenge
to
the
wrath
of
supernatural
powers
the
psychological
motives
which
produce
a
conservative
spirit
hostile
to
new
ideas
are
reinforced
by
the
active
opposition
of
certain
powerful
sections
of
the
community
such
as
a
class
a
caste
or
a
priesthood
whose
interests
are
bound
up
with
the
maintenance
of
the
established
order
and
the
ideas
on
which
it
rests
let
us
suppose
for
instance
that
a
people
believes
that
solar
eclipses
are
signs
employed
by
their
deity
for
the
special
purpose
of
communicating
useful
information
to
them
and
that
a
clever
man
discovers
the
true
cause
of
eclipses
his
compatriots
in
the
first
place
dislike
his
discovery
because
they
find
it
very
difficult
to
reconcile
with
their
other
ideas
in
the
second
place
it
disturbs
them
because
it
upsets
an
arrangement
which
they
consider
highly
advantageous
to
their
community
finally
it
frightens
them
as
an
offence
to
their
divinity
the
priests
one
of
whose
functions
is
to
interpret
the
divine
signs
are
alarmed
and
enraged
at
a
doctrine
which
menaces
their
power
in
prehistoric
days
these
motives
operating
strongly
must
have
made
change
slow
in
communities
which
progressed
and
hindered
some
communities
from
progressing
at
all
but
they
have
continued
to
operate
more
or
less
throughout
history
obstructing
knowledge
and
progress
we
can
observe
them
at
work
even
in
the
most
advanced
societies
where
they
have
no
longer
the
power
to
arrest
development
or
repress
the
publication
of
revolutionary
opinions
we
still
meet
people
who
consider
a
new
idea
an
annoyance
and
probably
a
danger
of
those
to
whom
socialism
is
repugnant
how
many
are
there
who
have
never
examined
the
arguments
for
and
against
it
but
turn
away
in
disgust
simply
because
the
notion
disturbs
their
mental
universe
and
implies
a
drastic
criticism
on
the
order
of
things
to
which
they
are
accustomed
and
how
many
are
there
who
would
refuse
to
consider
any
proposals
for
altering
our
imperfect
matrimonial
institutions
because
such
an
idea
offends
a
mass
of
prejudice
associated
with
religious
sanctions
they
may
be
right
or
not
but
if
they
are
it
is
not
their
fault
they
are
actuated
by
the
same
motives
which
were
a
bar
to
progress
in
primitive
societies
the
existence
of
people
of
this
mentality
reared
in
an
atmosphere
of
freedom
side
by
side
with
others
who
are
always
looking
out
for
new
ideas
and
regretting
that
there
are
not
more
about
enables
us
to
realize
how
when
public
opinion
was
formed
by
the
views
of
such
men
thought
was
fettered
and
the
impediments
to
knowledge
enormous
although
the
liberty
to
publish
opinions
on
any
subject
without
regard
to
authority
or
the
prejudices
of
neighbours
is
now
a
established
principle
i
imagine
that
only
the
minority
of
those
who
would
be
ready
to
fight
to
the
death
rather
than
surrender
it
could
defend
it
on
rational
grounds
we
are
apt
to
take
for
granted
that
freedom
of
speech
is
a
natural
and
inalienable
birthright
of
man
and
perhaps
to
think
that
this
is
a
sufficient
answer
to
all
that
can
be
said
on
the
other
side
but
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
such
a
right
can
be
established
if
a
man
has
any
rights
the
right
to
preserve
his
life
and
the
right
to
reproduce
his
kind
are
certainly
such
yet
human
societies
impose
upon
their
members
restrictions
in
the
exercise
of
both
these
rights
a
starving
man
is
prohibited
from
taking
food
which
belongs
to
somebody
else
promiscuous
reproduction
is
restricted
by
various
laws
or
customs
it
is
admitted
that
society
is
justified
in
restricting
these
elementary
rights
because
without
such
restrictions
an
ordered
society
could
not
exist
if
then
we
concede
that
the
expression
of
opinion
is
a
right
of
the
same
kind
it
is
impossible
to
contend
that
on
this
ground
it
can
claim
immunity
from
interference
or
that
society
acts
unjustly
in
regulating
it
but
the
concession
is
too
large
for
whereas
in
the
other
cases
the
limitations
affect
the
conduct
of
every
one
restrictions
on
freedom
of
opinion
affect
only
the
comparatively
small
number
who
have
any
opinions
revolutionary
or
unconventional
to
express
the
truth
is
that
no
valid
argument
can
be
founded
on
the
conception
of
natural
rights
because
it
involves
an
untenable
theory
of
the
relations
between
society
and
its
members
on
the
other
hand
those
who
have
the
responsibility
of
governing
a
society
can
argue
that
it
is
as
incumbent
on
them
to
prohibit
the
circulation
of
pernicious
opinions
as
to
prohibit
any
actions
they
can
argue
that
a
man
may
do
far
more
harm
by
propagating
doctrines
than
by
stealing
his
horse
or
making
love
to
his
wife
they
are
responsible
for
the
welfare
of
the
state
and
if
they
are
convinced
that
an
opinion
is
dangerous
by
menacing
the
political
religious
or
moral
assumptions
on
which
the
society
is
based
it
is
their
duty
to
protect
society
against
it
as
against
any
other
danger
the
true
answer
to
this
argument
for
limiting
freedom
of
thought
will
appear
in
due
course
it
was
far
from
obvious
a
long
time
was
needed
to
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
coercion
of
opinion
is
a
mistake
and
only
a
part
of
the
world
is
yet
convinced
that
conclusion
so
far
as
i
can
judge
is
the
most
important
ever
reached
by
men
it
was
the
issue
of
a
continuous
struggle
between
authority
and
subject
of
this
volume
the
word
authority
requires
some
comment
if
you
ask
somebody
how
he
knows
something
he
may
say
have
it
on
good
authority
or
read
it
in
a
book
or
is
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
or
learned
it
at
any
of
these
replies
means
that
he
has
accepted
information
from
others
trusting
in
their
knowledge
without
verifying
their
statements
or
thinking
the
matter
out
for
himself
and
the
greater
part
of
most
knowledge
and
beliefs
is
of
this
kind
taken
without
verification
from
their
parents
teachers
acquaintances
books
newspapers
when
an
english
boy
learns
french
he
takes
the
conjugations
and
the
meanings
of
the
words
on
the
authority
of
his
teacher
or
his
grammar
the
fact
that
in
a
certain
place
marked
on
the
map
there
is
a
populous
city
called
calcutta
is
for
most
people
a
fact
accepted
on
authority
so
is
the
existence
of
napoleon
or
julius
caesar
familiar
astronomical
facts
are
known
only
in
the
same
way
except
by
those
who
have
studied
astronomy
it
is
obvious
that
every
knowledge
would
be
very
limited
indeed
if
we
were
not
justified
in
accepting
facts
on
the
authority
of
others
but
we
are
justified
only
under
one
condition
the
facts
which
we
can
safely
accept
must
be
capable
of
demonstration
or
verification
the
examples
i
have
given
belong
to
this
class
the
boy
can
verify
when
he
goes
to
france
or
is
able
to
read
a
french
book
that
the
facts
which
he
took
on
authority
are
true
i
am
confronted
every
day
with
evidence
which
proves
to
me
that
if
i
took
the
trouble
i
could
verify
the
existence
of
calcutta
for
myself
i
can
not
convince
myself
in
this
way
of
the
existence
of
napoleon
but
if
i
have
doubts
about
it
a
simple
process
of
reasoning
shows
me
that
there
are
hosts
of
facts
which
are
incompatible
with
his
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
earth
is
some
millions
of
miles
distant
from
the
sun
because
all
astronomers
agree
that
it
has
been
demonstrated
and
their
agreement
is
only
explicable
on
the
supposition
that
this
has
been
demonstrated
and
that
if
i
took
the
trouble
to
work
out
the
calculation
i
should
reach
the
same
result
but
all
our
mental
furniture
is
not
of
this
kind
the
thoughts
of
the
average
man
consist
not
only
of
facts
open
to
verification
but
also
of
many
beliefs
and
opinions
which
he
has
accepted
on
authority
and
can
not
verify
or
prove
belief
in
the
trinity
depends
on
the
authority
of
the
church
and
is
clearly
of
a
different
order
from
belief
in
the
existence
of
calcutta
we
can
not
go
behind
the
authority
and
verify
or
prove
it
if
we
accept
it
we
do
so
because
we
have
such
implicit
faith
in
the
authority
that
we
credit
its
assertions
though
incapable
of
proof
the
distinction
may
seem
so
obvious
as
to
be
hardly
worth
making
but
it
is
important
to
be
quite
clear
about
it
the
primitive
man
who
had
learned
from
his
elders
that
there
were
bears
in
the
hills
and
likewise
evil
spirits
soon
verified
the
former
statement
by
seeing
a
bear
but
if
he
did
not
happen
to
meet
an
evil
spirit
it
did
not
occur
to
him
unless
he
was
a
prodigy
that
there
was
a
distinction
between
the
two
statements
he
would
rather
have
argued
if
he
argued
at
all
that
as
his
tribesmen
were
right
about
the
bears
they
were
sure
to
be
right
also
about
the
spirits
in
the
middle
ages
a
man
who
believed
on
authority
that
there
is
a
city
called
constantinople
and
that
comets
are
portents
signifying
divine
wrath
would
not
distinguish
the
nature
of
the
evidence
in
the
two
cases
you
may
still
sometimes
hear
arguments
amounting
to
this
since
i
believe
in
calcutta
on
authority
am
i
not
entitled
to
believe
in
the
devil
on
authority
now
people
at
all
times
have
been
commanded
or
expected
or
invited
to
accept
on
authority
authority
for
instance
of
public
opinion
or
a
church
or
a
sacred
which
are
not
proved
or
are
not
capable
of
proof
most
beliefs
about
nature
and
man
which
were
not
founded
on
scientific
observation
have
served
directly
or
indirectly
religious
and
social
interests
and
hence
they
have
been
protected
by
force
against
the
criticisms
of
persons
who
have
the
inconvenient
habit
of
using
their
reason
nobody
minds
if
his
neighbour
disbelieves
a
demonstrable
fact
if
a
sceptic
denies
that
napoleon
existed
or
that
water
is
composed
of
oxygen
and
hydrogen
he
causes
amusement
or
ridicule
but
if
he
denies
doctrines
which
can
not
be
demonstrated
such
as
the
existence
of
a
personal
god
or
the
immortality
of
the
soul
he
incurs
serious
disapprobation
and
at
one
time
he
might
have
been
put
to
death
our
mediaeval
friend
would
have
only
been
called
a
fool
if
he
doubted
the
existence
of
constantinople
but
if
he
had
questioned
the
significance
of
comets
he
might
have
got
into
trouble
it
is
possible
that
if
he
had
been
so
mad
as
to
deny
the
existence
of
jerusalem
he
would
not
have
escaped
with
ridicule
for
jerusalem
is
mentioned
in
the
bible
in
the
middle
ages
a
large
field
was
covered
by
beliefs
which
authority
claimed
to
impose
as
true
and
reason
was
warned
off
the
ground
but
reason
can
not
recognize
arbitrary
prohibitions
or
barriers
without
being
untrue
to
herself
the
universe
of
experience
is
her
province
and
as
its
parts
are
all
linked
together
and
interdependent
it
is
impossible
for
her
to
recognize
any
territory
on
which
she
may
not
tread
or
to
surrender
any
of
her
rights
to
an
authority
whose
credentials
she
has
not
examined
and
approved
the
uncompromising
assertion
by
reason
of
her
absolute
rights
throughout
the
whole
domain
of
thought
is
termed
rationalism
and
the
slight
stigma
which
is
still
attached
to
the
word
reflects
the
bitterness
of
the
struggle
between
reason
and
the
forces
arrayed
against
her
the
term
is
limited
to
the
field
of
theology
because
it
was
in
that
field
that
the
of
reason
was
most
violently
and
pertinaciously
opposed
in
the
same
way
free
thought
the
refusal
of
thought
to
be
controlled
by
any
authority
but
its
own
has
a
definitely
theological
reference
throughout
the
conflict
authority
has
had
great
advantages
at
any
time
the
people
who
really
care
about
reason
have
been
a
small
minority
and
probably
will
be
so
for
a
long
time
to
come
only
weapon
has
been
argument
authority
has
employed
physical
and
moral
violence
legal
coercion
and
social
displeasure
sometimes
she
has
attempted
to
use
the
sword
of
her
adversary
thereby
wounding
herself
indeed
the
weakest
point
in
the
strategical
position
of
authority
was
that
her
champions
being
human
could
not
help
making
use
of
reasoning
processes
and
the
result
was
that
they
were
divided
among
themselves
this
gave
reason
her
chance
operating
as
it
were
in
the
camp
and
professedly
in
the
cause
she
was
preparing
her
own
victory
it
may
be
objected
that
there
is
a
legitimate
domain
for
authority
consisting
of
doctrines
which
lie
outside
human
experience
and
therefore
can
not
be
proved
or
verified
but
at
the
same
time
can
not
be
disproved
of
course
any
number
of
propositions
can
be
invented
which
can
not
be
disproved
and
it
is
open
to
any
one
who
possesses
exuberant
faith
to
believe
them
but
no
one
will
maintain
that
they
all
deserve
credence
so
long
as
their
falsehood
is
not
demonstrated
and
if
only
some
deserve
credence
who
except
reason
is
to
decide
which
if
the
reply
is
authority
we
are
confronted
by
the
difficulty
that
many
beliefs
backed
by
authority
have
been
finally
disproved
and
are
universally
abandoned
yet
some
people
speak
as
if
we
were
not
justified
in
rejecting
a
theological
doctrine
unless
we
can
prove
it
false
but
the
burden
of
proof
does
not
lie
upon
the
rejecter
i
remember
a
conversation
in
which
when
some
disrespectful
remark
was
made
about
hell
a
loyal
friend
of
that
establishment
said
triumphantly
absurd
as
it
may
seem
you
can
not
disprove
if
you
were
told
that
in
a
certain
planet
revolving
round
sirius
there
is
a
race
of
donkeys
who
talk
the
english
language
and
spend
their
time
in
discussing
eugenics
you
could
not
disprove
the
statement
but
would
it
on
that
account
have
any
claim
to
be
believed
some
minds
would
be
prepared
to
accept
it
if
it
were
reiterated
often
enough
through
the
potent
force
of
suggestion
this
force
exercised
largely
by
emphatic
repetition
the
theoretical
basis
as
has
been
observed
of
the
modern
practice
of
advertising
has
played
a
great
part
in
establishing
authoritative
opinions
and
propagating
religious
creeds
reason
fortunately
is
able
to
avail
herself
of
the
same
help
the
following
sketch
is
confined
to
western
civilization
it
begins
with
greece
and
attempts
to
indicate
the
chief
phases
it
is
the
merest
introduction
to
a
vast
and
intricate
subject
which
treated
adequately
would
involve
not
only
the
history
of
religion
of
the
churches
of
heresies
of
persecution
but
also
the
history
of
philosophy
of
the
natural
sciences
and
of
political
theories
from
the
sixteenth
century
to
the
french
revolution
nearly
all
important
historical
events
bore
in
some
way
on
the
struggle
for
freedom
of
thought
it
would
require
a
lifetime
to
calculate
and
many
books
to
describe
all
the
directions
and
interactions
of
the
intellectual
and
social
forces
which
since
the
fall
of
ancient
civilization
have
hindered
and
helped
the
emancipation
of
reason
all
one
can
do
all
one
could
do
even
in
a
much
bigger
volume
than
this
is
to
indicate
the
general
course
of
the
struggle
and
dwell
on
some
particular
aspects
which
the
writer
may
happen
to
have
specially
studied
chapter
ii
reason
free
greece
and
rome
when
we
are
asked
to
specify
the
debt
which
civilization
owes
to
the
greeks
their
achievements
in
literature
and
art
naturally
occur
to
us
first
of
all
but
a
truer
answer
may
be
that
our
deepest
gratitude
is
due
to
them
as
the
originators
of
liberty
of
thought
and
discussion
for
this
freedom
of
spirit
was
not
only
the
condition
of
their
speculations
in
philosophy
their
progress
in
science
their
experiments
in
political
institutions
it
was
also
a
condition
of
their
literary
and
artistic
excellence
their
literature
for
instance
could
not
have
been
what
it
is
if
they
had
been
debarred
from
free
criticism
of
life
but
apart
from
what
they
actually
accomplished
even
if
they
had
not
achieved
the
wonderful
things
they
did
in
most
of
the
realms
of
human
activity
their
assertion
of
the
principle
of
liberty
would
place
them
in
the
highest
rank
among
the
benefactors
of
the
race
for
it
was
one
of
the
greatest
steps
in
human
progress
we
do
not
know
enough
about
the
earliest
history
of
the
greeks
to
explain
how
it
was
that
they
attained
their
free
outlook
upon
the
world
and
came
to
possess
the
will
and
courage
to
set
no
bounds
to
the
range
of
their
criticism
and
curiosity
we
have
to
take
this
character
as
a
fact
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
greeks
consisted
of
a
large
number
of
separate
peoples
who
varied
largely
in
temper
customs
and
traditions
though
they
had
important
features
common
to
all
some
were
conservative
or
backward
or
unintellectual
compared
with
others
in
this
chapter
does
not
mean
all
the
greeks
but
only
those
who
count
most
in
the
history
of
civilization
especially
the
ionians
and
athenians
ionia
in
asia
minor
was
the
cradle
of
free
speculation
the
history
of
european
science
and
european
philosophy
begins
in
ionia
here
in
the
sixth
and
fifth
centuries
the
early
philosophers
by
using
their
reason
sought
to
penetrate
into
the
origin
and
structure
of
the
world
they
could
not
of
course
free
their
minds
entirely
from
received
notions
but
they
began
the
work
of
destroying
orthodox
views
and
religious
faiths
xenophanes
may
specially
be
named
among
these
pioneers
of
thought
though
he
was
not
the
most
important
or
the
ablest
because
the
toleration
of
his
teaching
illustrates
the
freedom
of
the
atmosphere
in
which
these
men
lived
he
went
about
from
city
to
city
calling
in
question
on
moral
grounds
the
popular
beliefs
about
the
gods
and
goddesses
and
ridiculing
the
anthropomorphic
conceptions
which
the
greeks
had
formed
of
their
divinities
oxen
had
hands
and
the
capacities
of
men
they
would
make
gods
in
the
shape
of
this
attack
on
received
theology
was
an
attack
on
the
veracity
of
the
old
poets
especially
homer
who
was
considered
the
highest
authority
on
mythology
xenophanes
criticized
him
severely
for
ascribing
to
the
gods
acts
which
committed
by
men
would
be
considered
highly
disgraceful
we
do
not
hear
that
any
attempt
was
made
to
restrain
him
from
thus
assailing
traditional
beliefs
and
branding
homer
as
immoral
we
must
remember
that
the
homeric
poems
were
never
supposed
to
be
the
word
of
god
it
has
been
said
that
homer
was
the
bible
of
the
greeks
the
remark
exactly
misses
the
truth
the
greeks
fortunately
had
no
bible
and
this
fact
was
both
an
expression
and
an
important
condition
of
their
freedom
poems
were
secular
not
religious
and
it
may
be
noted
that
they
are
freer
from
immorality
and
savagery
than
sacred
books
that
one
could
mention
their
authority
was
immense
but
it
was
not
binding
like
the
authority
of
a
sacred
book
and
so
homeric
criticism
was
never
hampered
like
biblical
criticism
in
this
connexion
notice
may
be
taken
of
another
expression
and
condition
of
freedom
the
absence
of
sacerdotalism
the
priests
of
the
temples
never
became
powerful
castes
tyrannizing
over
the
community
in
their
own
interests
and
able
to
silence
voices
raised
against
religious
beliefs
the
civil
authorities
kept
the
general
control
of
public
worship
in
their
own
hands
and
if
some
priestly
families
might
have
considerable
influence
yet
as
a
rule
the
priests
were
virtually
state
servants
whose
voice
carried
no
weight
except
concerning
the
technical
details
of
ritual
to
return
to
the
early
philosophers
who
were
mostly
materialists
the
record
of
their
speculations
is
an
interesting
chapter
in
the
history
of
rationalism
two
great
names
may
be
selected
heraclitus
and
democritus
because
they
did
more
perhaps
than
any
of
the
others
by
sheer
hard
thinking
to
train
reason
to
look
upon
the
universe
in
new
ways
and
to
shock
the
unreasoned
conceptions
of
common
sense
it
was
startling
to
be
taught
for
the
first
time
by
heraclitus
that
the
appearance
of
stability
and
permanence
which
material
things
present
to
our
senses
is
a
false
appearance
and
that
the
world
and
everything
in
it
are
changing
every
instant
democritus
performed
the
amazing
feat
of
working
out
an
atomic
theory
of
the
universe
which
was
revived
in
the
seventeenth
century
and
is
connected
in
the
history
of
speculation
with
the
most
modern
physical
and
chemical
theories
of
matter
no
fantastic
tales
of
creation
imposed
by
sacred
authority
hampered
these
powerful
brains
all
this
philosophical
speculation
prepared
the
way
for
the
educationalists
who
were
known
as
the
sophists
they
begin
to
appear
after
the
middle
of
the
fifth
century
they
worked
here
and
there
throughout
greece
constantly
travelling
training
young
men
for
public
life
and
teaching
them
to
use
their
reason
as
educators
they
had
practical
ends
in
view
they
turned
away
from
the
problems
of
the
physical
universe
to
the
problems
of
human
and
polities
here
they
were
confronted
with
the
difficulty
of
distinguishing
between
truth
and
error
and
the
ablest
of
them
investigated
the
nature
of
knowledge
the
method
of
and
the
instrument
of
whatever
their
particular
theories
might
be
their
general
spirit
was
that
of
free
inquiry
and
discussion
they
sought
to
test
everything
by
reason
the
second
half
of
the
fifth
century
might
be
called
the
age
of
illumination
it
may
be
remarked
that
the
knowledge
of
foreign
countries
which
the
greeks
had
acquired
had
a
considerable
effect
in
promoting
a
sceptical
attitude
towards
authority
when
a
man
is
acquainted
only
with
the
habits
of
his
own
country
they
seem
so
much
a
matter
of
course
that
he
ascribes
them
to
nature
but
when
he
travels
abroad
and
finds
totally
different
habits
and
standards
of
conduct
prevailing
he
begins
to
understand
the
power
of
custom
and
learns
that
morality
and
religion
are
matters
of
latitude
this
discovery
tends
to
weaken
authority
and
to
raise
disquieting
reflections
as
in
the
case
of
one
who
brought
up
as
a
christian
comes
to
realize
that
if
he
had
been
born
on
the
ganges
or
the
euphrates
he
would
have
firmly
believed
in
entirely
different
dogmas
of
course
these
movements
of
intellectual
freedom
were
as
in
all
ages
confined
to
the
minority
everywhere
the
masses
were
exceedingly
superstitious
they
believed
that
the
safety
of
their
cities
depended
on
the
of
their
gods
if
this
superstitious
spirit
were
alarmed
there
was
always
a
danger
that
philosophical
speculations
might
be
persecuted
and
this
occurred
in
athens
about
the
middle
of
the
fifth
century
athens
had
not
only
become
the
most
powerful
state
in
greece
but
was
also
taking
the
highest
place
in
literature
and
art
she
was
a
democracy
political
discussion
was
perfectly
free
at
this
time
she
was
guided
by
the
statesman
pericles
who
was
personally
a
freethinker
or
at
least
was
in
touch
with
all
the
subversive
speculations
of
the
day
he
was
especially
intimate
with
the
philosopher
anaxagoras
who
had
come
from
ionia
to
teach
at
athens
in
regard
to
the
popular
gods
anaxagoras
was
a
unbeliever
the
political
enemies
of
pericles
struck
at
him
by
attacking
his
friend
they
introduced
and
carried
a
blasphemy
law
to
the
effect
that
unbelievers
and
those
who
taught
theories
about
the
celestial
world
might
be
impeached
it
was
easy
to
prove
that
anaxagoras
was
a
blasphemer
who
taught
that
the
gods
were
abstractions
and
that
the
sun
to
which
the
ordinary
athenian
said
prayers
morning
and
evening
was
a
mass
of
flaming
matter
the
influence
of
pericles
saved
him
from
death
he
was
heavily
fined
and
left
athens
for
lampsacus
where
he
was
treated
with
consideration
and
honour
other
cases
are
recorded
which
show
that
thought
was
liable
to
be
persecuted
protagoras
one
of
the
greatest
of
the
sophists
published
a
book
on
the
gods
the
object
of
which
seems
to
have
been
to
prove
that
one
can
not
know
the
gods
by
reason
the
first
words
ran
the
gods
i
can
not
say
that
they
exist
nor
yet
that
they
do
not
exist
there
are
more
reasons
than
one
why
we
can
not
know
there
is
the
obscurity
of
the
subject
and
there
is
the
brevity
of
human
a
charge
of
blasphemy
was
lodged
against
him
and
he
fled
from
athens
but
there
was
no
systematic
policy
of
suppressing
free
thought
copies
of
the
work
of
protagoras
were
collected
and
burned
but
the
book
of
anaxagoras
setting
forth
the
views
for
which
he
had
been
condemned
was
for
sale
on
the
athenian
at
a
popular
price
rationalistic
ideas
moreover
were
venturing
to
appear
on
the
stage
though
the
dramatic
performances
at
the
feasts
of
the
god
dionysus
were
religious
solemnities
the
poet
euripides
was
saturated
with
modern
speculation
and
while
different
opinions
may
be
held
as
to
the
tendencies
of
some
of
his
tragedies
he
often
allows
his
characters
to
express
highly
unorthodox
views
he
was
prosecuted
for
impiety
by
a
popular
politician
we
may
suspect
that
during
the
last
thirty
years
of
the
fifth
century
unorthodoxy
spread
considerably
among
the
educated
classes
there
was
a
large
enough
section
of
influential
rationalists
to
render
impossible
any
organized
repression
of
liberty
and
the
chief
evil
of
the
blasphemy
law
was
that
it
could
be
used
for
personal
or
party
reasons
some
of
the
prosecutions
about
which
we
know
were
certainly
due
to
such
motives
others
may
have
been
prompted
by
genuine
bigotry
and
by
the
fear
lest
sceptical
thought
should
extend
beyond
the
highly
educated
and
leisured
class
it
was
a
generally
accepted
principle
among
the
greeks
and
afterwards
among
the
romans
that
religion
was
a
good
and
necessary
thing
for
the
common
people
men
who
did
not
believe
in
its
truth
believed
in
its
usefulness
as
a
political
institution
and
as
a
rule
philosophers
did
not
seek
to
diffuse
disturbing
among
the
masses
it
was
the
custom
much
more
than
at
the
present
day
for
those
who
did
not
believe
in
the
established
cults
to
conform
to
them
externally
popular
higher
education
was
not
an
article
in
the
programme
of
greek
statesmen
or
thinkers
and
perhaps
it
may
be
argued
that
in
the
circumstances
of
the
ancient
world
it
would
have
been
hardly
practicable
there
was
however
one
illustrious
athenian
who
thought
the
philosopher
socrates
was
the
greatest
of
the
educationalists
but
unlike
the
others
he
taught
gratuitously
though
he
was
a
poor
man
his
teaching
always
took
the
form
of
discussion
the
discussion
often
ended
in
no
positive
result
but
had
the
effect
of
showing
that
some
received
opinion
was
untenable
and
that
truth
is
difficult
to
ascertain
he
had
indeed
certain
definite
views
about
knowledge
and
virtue
which
are
of
the
highest
importance
in
the
history
of
philosophy
but
for
our
present
purpose
his
significance
lies
in
his
enthusiasm
for
discussion
and
criticism
he
taught
those
with
whom
he
he
conversed
indiscriminately
with
all
who
would
listen
to
bring
all
popular
beliefs
before
the
bar
of
reason
to
approach
every
inquiry
with
an
open
mind
and
not
to
judge
by
the
opinion
of
majorities
or
the
dictate
of
authority
in
short
to
seek
for
other
tests
of
the
truth
of
an
opinion
than
the
fact
that
it
is
held
by
a
great
many
people
among
his
disciples
were
all
the
young
men
who
were
to
become
the
leading
philosophers
of
the
next
generation
and
some
who
played
prominent
parts
in
athenian
history
if
the
athenians
had
had
a
daily
press
socrates
would
have
been
denounced
by
the
journalists
as
a
dangerous
person
they
had
a
comic
drama
which
constantly
held
up
to
ridicule
philosophers
and
sophists
and
their
vain
doctrines
we
possess
one
play
the
clouds
of
aristophanes
in
which
socrates
is
pilloried
as
a
typical
representative
of
impious
and
destructive
speculations
apart
from
annoyances
of
this
kind
socrates
reached
old
age
pursuing
the
task
of
instructing
his
without
any
evil
befalling
him
then
at
the
age
of
seventy
he
was
prosecuted
as
an
atheist
and
corrupter
of
youth
and
was
put
to
death
it
is
strange
that
if
the
athenians
really
thought
him
dangerous
they
should
have
suffered
him
so
long
there
can
i
think
be
little
doubt
that
the
motives
of
the
accusation
were
political
socrates
looking
at
things
as
he
did
could
not
be
sympathetic
with
unlimited
democracy
or
approve
of
the
principle
that
the
will
of
the
ignorant
majority
was
a
good
guide
he
was
probably
known
to
sympathize
with
those
who
wished
to
limit
the
franchise
when
after
a
struggle
in
which
the
constitution
had
been
more
than
once
overthrown
democracy
emerged
triumphant
there
was
a
bitter
feeling
against
those
who
had
not
been
its
friends
and
of
these
disloyal
persons
socrates
was
chosen
as
a
victim
if
he
had
wished
he
could
easily
have
escaped
if
he
had
given
an
undertaking
to
teach
no
more
he
would
almost
certainly
have
been
acquitted
as
it
was
of
the
ordinary
athenians
who
were
his
judges
a
very
large
minority
voted
for
his
acquittal
even
then
if
he
had
adopted
a
different
tone
he
would
not
have
been
condemned
to
death
he
rose
to
the
great
occasion
and
vindicated
freedom
of
discussion
in
a
wonderful
unconventional
speech
the
apology
of
socrates
which
was
composed
by
his
most
brilliant
pupil
plato
the
philosopher
reproduces
the
general
tenor
of
his
defence
it
is
clear
that
he
was
not
able
to
meet
satisfactorily
the
charge
that
he
did
not
acknowledge
the
gods
worshipped
by
the
city
and
his
explanations
on
this
point
are
the
weak
part
of
his
speech
but
he
met
the
accusation
that
he
corrupted
the
minds
of
the
young
by
a
splendid
plea
for
free
discussion
this
is
the
most
valuable
section
of
the
apology
it
is
as
impressive
as
ever
i
think
the
two
principal
points
which
he
makes
are
he
maintains
that
the
individual
should
at
any
cost
refuse
to
be
coerced
by
any
human
authority
or
tribunal
into
a
course
which
his
own
mind
condemns
as
wrong
that
is
he
asserts
the
supremacy
of
the
individual
conscience
as
we
should
say
over
human
law
he
represents
his
own
as
a
sort
of
religious
quest
he
feels
convinced
that
in
devoting
himself
to
philosophical
discussion
he
has
done
the
bidding
of
a
guide
and
he
goes
to
death
rather
than
be
untrue
to
this
personal
conviction
you
propose
to
acquit
me
he
says
condition
that
i
abandon
my
search
for
truth
i
will
say
i
thank
you
o
athenians
but
i
will
obey
god
who
as
i
believe
set
me
this
task
rather
than
you
and
so
long
as
i
have
breath
and
strength
i
will
never
cease
from
my
occupation
with
philosophy
i
will
continue
the
practice
of
accosting
whomever
i
meet
and
saying
to
him
you
not
ashamed
of
setting
your
heart
on
wealth
and
honours
while
you
have
no
care
for
wisdom
and
truth
and
making
your
soul
better
i
know
not
what
death
may
be
a
good
thing
and
i
am
not
afraid
of
it
but
i
do
know
that
it
is
a
bad
thing
to
desert
post
and
i
prefer
what
may
be
good
to
what
i
know
to
be
he
insists
on
the
public
value
of
free
discussion
me
you
have
a
stimulating
critic
persistently
urging
you
with
persuasion
and
reproaches
persistently
testing
your
opinions
and
trying
to
show
you
that
you
are
really
ignorant
of
what
you
suppose
you
know
daily
discussion
of
the
matters
about
which
you
hear
me
conversing
is
the
highest
good
for
man
life
that
is
not
tested
by
such
discussion
is
not
worth
thus
in
what
we
may
call
the
earliest
justification
of
liberty
of
thought
we
have
two
significant
claims
affirmed
the
indefeasible
right
of
the
conscience
of
the
individual
claim
on
which
later
struggles
for
liberty
were
to
turn
and
the
social
importance
of
discussion
and
criticism
the
former
claim
is
not
based
on
argument
but
on
intuition
it
rests
in
fact
on
the
assumption
of
some
sort
of
superhuman
moral
principle
and
to
those
who
not
having
the
same
personal
experience
as
socrates
reject
this
assumption
his
pleading
does
not
carry
weight
the
second
claim
after
the
experience
of
more
than
years
can
be
formulated
more
comprehensively
now
with
bearings
of
which
he
did
not
dream
the
circumstances
of
the
trial
of
socrates
illustrate
both
the
tolerance
and
the
intolerance
which
prevailed
at
athens
his
long
immunity
the
fact
that
he
was
at
last
indicted
from
political
motives
and
perhaps
personal
also
the
large
minority
in
his
favour
all
show
that
thought
was
normally
free
and
that
the
mass
of
intolerance
which
existed
was
only
fitfully
invoked
and
perhaps
most
often
to
serve
other
purposes
i
may
mention
the
case
of
the
philosopher
aristotle
who
some
seventy
years
later
left
athens
because
he
was
menaced
by
a
prosecution
for
blasphemy
the
charge
being
a
pretext
for
attacking
one
who
belonged
to
a
certain
political
party
the
persecution
of
opinion
was
never
organized
it
may
seem
curious
that
to
find
the
persecuting
spirit
in
greece
we
have
to
turn
to
the
philosophers
plato
the
most
brilliant
disciple
of
socrates
constructed
in
his
later
years
an
ideal
state
in
this
state
he
instituted
a
religion
considerably
different
from
the
current
religion
and
proposed
to
compel
all
the
citizens
to
believe
in
his
gods
on
pain
of
death
or
imprisonment
all
freedom
of
discussion
was
excluded
under
the
system
which
he
conceived
but
the
point
of
interest
in
his
attitude
is
that
he
did
not
care
much
whether
a
religion
was
true
but
only
whether
it
was
morally
useful
he
was
prepared
to
promote
morality
by
edifying
fables
and
he
condemned
the
popular
mythology
not
because
it
was
false
but
because
it
did
not
make
for
righteousness
the
outcome
of
the
large
freedom
permitted
at
athens
was
a
series
of
philosophies
which
had
a
common
source
in
the
conversations
of
socrates
plato
aristotle
the
stoics
the
epicureans
the
may
be
maintained
that
the
efforts
of
thought
represented
by
these
names
have
had
a
deeper
influence
on
the
progress
of
man
than
any
other
continuous
intellectual
movement
at
least
until
the
rise
of
modern
science
in
a
new
epoch
of
liberty
the
doctrines
of
the
epicureans
stoics
and
sceptics
all
aimed
at
securing
peace
and
guidance
for
the
individual
soul
they
were
widely
propagated
throughout
the
greek
world
from
the
third
century
and
we
may
say
that
from
this
time
onward
most
greeks
were
more
or
less
rationalists
the
teaching
of
epicurus
had
a
distinct
tendency
he
considered
fear
to
be
the
fundamental
motive
of
religion
and
to
free
minds
from
this
fear
was
a
principal
object
of
his
teaching
he
was
a
materialist
explaining
the
world
by
the
atomic
theory
of
democritus
and
denying
any
divine
government
of
the
universe
he
did
indeed
hold
the
existence
of
gods
but
so
far
as
men
are
concerned
his
gods
are
as
if
they
were
in
some
remote
abode
and
enjoying
a
and
everlasting
they
just
served
as
an
example
of
the
realization
of
the
ideal
epicurean
life
there
was
something
in
this
philosophy
which
had
the
power
to
inspire
a
poet
of
singular
genius
to
expound
it
in
verse
the
roman
lucretius
first
century
regarded
epicurus
as
the
great
deliverer
of
the
human
race
and
determined
to
proclaim
the
glad
tidings
of
his
philosophy
in
a
poem
on
the
nature
of
the
world
with
all
the
fervour
of
a
religious
enthusiast
he
denounces
religion
sounding
every
note
of
defiance
loathing
and
contempt
and
branding
in
burning
words
the
crimes
to
which
it
had
urged
man
on
he
rides
forth
as
a
leader
of
the
hosts
of
atheism
against
the
walls
of
heaven
he
explains
the
scientific
arguments
as
if
they
were
the
radiant
revelation
of
a
new
world
and
the
rapture
of
his
enthusiasm
is
a
strange
accompaniment
of
a
doctrine
which
aimed
at
perfect
calm
although
the
greek
thinkers
had
done
all
the
work
and
the
latin
poem
is
a
hymn
of
triumph
over
prostrate
deities
yet
in
the
literature
of
free
thought
it
must
always
hold
an
eminent
place
by
the
sincerity
of
its
audacious
defiant
spirit
in
the
history
of
rationalism
its
interest
would
be
greater
if
it
had
exploded
in
the
midst
of
an
orthodox
community
but
the
educated
romans
in
the
days
of
lucretius
were
sceptical
in
religious
matters
some
of
them
were
epicureans
and
we
may
suspect
that
not
many
of
those
who
read
it
were
shocked
or
influenced
by
the
audacities
of
the
champion
of
irreligion
the
stoic
philosophy
made
notable
contributions
to
the
cause
of
liberty
and
could
hardly
have
flourished
in
an
atmosphere
where
discussion
was
not
free
it
asserted
the
rights
of
individuals
against
public
authority
socrates
had
seen
that
laws
may
be
unjust
and
that
peoples
may
go
wrong
but
he
had
found
no
principle
for
the
guidance
of
society
the
stoics
discovered
it
in
the
law
of
nature
prior
and
superior
to
all
the
customs
and
written
laws
of
peoples
and
this
doctrine
spreading
outside
stoic
circles
caught
hold
of
the
roman
world
and
affected
roman
legislation
these
philosophies
have
carried
us
from
greece
to
rome
in
the
later
roman
republic
and
the
early
empire
no
restrictions
were
imposed
on
opinion
and
these
philosophies
which
made
the
individual
the
first
consideration
spread
widely
most
of
the
leading
men
were
unbelievers
in
the
official
religion
of
the
state
but
they
considered
it
valuable
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
the
uneducated
populace
in
order
a
greek
historian
expresses
high
approval
of
the
roman
policy
of
cultivating
superstition
for
the
benefit
of
the
masses
this
was
the
attitude
of
cicero
and
the
view
that
a
false
religion
is
indispensable
as
a
social
machine
was
general
among
ancient
unbelievers
it
is
common
in
one
form
or
another
at
least
religions
are
constantly
defended
on
the
ground
not
of
truth
but
of
utility
this
defence
belongs
to
the
statecraft
of
machiavelli
who
taught
that
religion
is
necessary
for
government
and
that
it
may
be
the
duty
of
a
ruler
to
support
a
religion
which
he
believes
to
be
false
a
word
must
be
said
of
lucian
second
century
the
last
greek
man
of
letters
whose
writings
appeal
to
everybody
he
attacked
the
popular
mythology
with
open
ridicule
it
is
impossible
to
say
whether
his
satires
had
any
effect
at
the
time
beyond
affording
enjoyment
to
educated
infidels
who
read
them
zeus
in
a
tragedy
part
is
one
of
the
most
effective
the
situation
which
lucian
imagined
here
would
be
paralleled
if
a
modern
writer
were
blasphemously
to
represent
the
persons
of
the
trinity
with
some
eminent
angels
and
saints
discussing
in
a
celestial
the
alarming
growth
of
unbelief
in
england
and
then
by
means
of
a
telephonic
apparatus
overhearing
a
dispute
between
a
freethinker
and
a
parson
on
a
public
platform
in
london
the
absurdities
of
anthropomorphism
have
never
been
the
subject
of
more
brilliant
jesting
than
in
satires
the
general
rule
of
roman
policy
was
to
tolerate
throughout
the
empire
all
religions
and
all
opinions
blasphemy
was
not
punished
the
principle
was
expressed
in
the
maxim
of
the
emperor
tiberius
the
gods
are
insulted
let
them
see
to
it
an
exception
to
the
rule
of
tolerance
was
made
in
the
case
of
the
christian
sect
and
the
treatment
of
this
oriental
religion
may
be
said
to
have
inaugurated
religious
persecution
in
europe
it
is
a
matter
of
interest
to
understand
why
emperors
who
were
able
humane
and
not
in
the
least
fanatical
adopted
this
exceptional
policy
for
a
long
time
the
christians
were
only
known
to
those
romans
who
happened
to
hear
of
them
as
a
sect
of
the
jews
the
jewish
was
the
one
religion
which
on
account
of
its
exclusiveness
and
intolerance
was
regarded
by
the
tolerant
pagans
with
disfavour
and
suspicion
but
though
it
sometimes
came
into
collision
with
the
roman
authorities
and
some
attacks
upon
it
were
made
it
was
the
constant
policy
of
the
emperors
to
let
it
alone
and
to
protect
the
jews
against
the
hatred
which
their
own
fanaticism
aroused
but
while
the
jewish
religion
was
endured
so
long
as
it
was
confined
to
those
who
were
born
into
it
the
prospect
of
its
dissemination
raised
a
new
question
grave
misgivings
might
arise
in
the
mind
of
a
ruler
at
seeing
a
creed
spreading
which
was
aggressively
hostile
to
all
the
other
creeds
of
the
which
lived
together
in
had
earned
for
its
adherents
the
reputation
of
being
the
enemies
of
the
human
race
might
not
its
expansion
beyond
the
israelites
involve
ultimately
a
danger
to
the
empire
for
its
spirit
was
incompatible
with
the
traditions
and
basis
of
roman
society
the
emperor
domitian
seems
to
have
seen
the
question
in
this
light
and
he
took
severe
measures
to
hinder
the
proselytizing
of
roman
citizens
some
of
those
whom
he
struck
may
have
been
christians
but
if
he
was
aware
of
the
distinction
there
was
from
his
point
of
view
no
difference
christianity
resembled
judaism
from
which
it
sprang
in
intolerance
and
in
hostility
towards
roman
society
but
it
differed
by
the
fact
that
it
made
many
proselytes
while
judaism
made
few
under
trajan
we
find
that
the
principle
has
been
laid
down
that
to
be
a
christian
is
an
offence
punishable
by
death
henceforward
christianity
remained
an
illegal
religion
but
in
practice
the
law
was
not
applied
rigorously
or
logically
the
emperors
desired
if
possible
to
extirpate
christianity
without
shedding
blood
trajan
laid
down
that
christians
were
not
to
be
sought
out
that
no
anonymous
charges
were
to
be
noticed
and
that
an
informer
who
failed
to
make
good
his
charge
should
be
liable
to
be
punished
under
the
laws
against
calumny
christians
themselves
recognized
that
this
edict
practically
protected
them
there
were
some
executions
in
the
second
many
that
are
well
christians
courted
the
pain
and
glory
of
martyrdom
there
is
evidence
to
show
that
when
they
were
arrested
their
escape
was
often
connived
at
in
general
the
persecution
of
the
christians
was
rather
provoked
by
the
populace
than
desired
by
the
authorities
the
populace
felt
a
horror
of
this
mysterious
oriental
sect
which
openly
hated
all
the
gods
and
prayed
for
the
destruction
of
the
world
when
floods
famines
and
especially
fires
occurred
they
were
apt
to
be
attributed
to
the
black
magic
of
the
christians
when
any
one
was
accused
of
christianity
he
was
required
as
a
means
of
testing
the
truth
of
the
charge
to
offer
incense
to
the
gods
or
to
the
statues
of
deified
emperors
his
compliance
at
once
exonerated
him
the
objection
of
the
and
the
jews
were
the
only
the
worship
of
the
emperors
was
in
the
eyes
of
the
romans
one
of
the
most
sinister
signs
that
their
religion
was
dangerous
the
purpose
of
this
worship
was
to
symbolize
the
unity
and
solidarity
of
an
empire
which
embraced
so
many
peoples
of
different
beliefs
and
different
gods
its
intention
was
political
to
promote
union
and
loyalty
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
those
who
denounced
it
should
be
suspected
of
a
disloyal
spirit
but
it
must
be
noted
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
any
citizen
to
take
part
in
this
worship
no
conformity
was
required
from
any
inhabitants
of
the
empire
who
were
not
serving
the
state
as
soldiers
or
civil
functionaries
thus
the
effect
was
to
debar
christians
from
military
and
official
careers
the
apologies
for
christianity
which
appeared
at
this
period
second
century
might
have
helped
if
the
emperors
to
whom
some
of
them
were
addressed
had
read
them
to
confirm
the
view
that
it
was
a
political
danger
it
would
have
been
easy
to
read
between
the
lines
that
if
the
christians
ever
got
the
upper
hand
they
would
not
spare
the
cults
of
the
state
the
contemporary
work
of
tatian
a
discourse
to
the
greeks
reveals
what
the
apologists
more
or
less
sought
to
disguise
invincible
hatred
towards
the
civilization
in
which
they
lived
any
reader
of
the
christian
literature
of
the
time
could
not
fail
to
see
that
in
a
state
where
christians
had
the
power
there
would
be
no
tolerance
of
other
religious
practices
if
the
emperors
made
an
exception
to
their
tolerant
policy
in
the
case
of
christianity
their
purpose
was
to
safeguard
tolerance
in
the
third
century
the
religion
though
still
forbidden
was
quite
openly
tolerated
the
church
organized
itself
without
concealment
ecclesiastical
councils
assembled
without
interference
there
were
some
brief
and
local
attempts
at
repression
there
was
only
one
grave
persecution
begun
by
decius
and
continued
by
valerian
in
fact
throughout
this
century
there
were
not
many
victims
though
afterwards
the
christians
invented
a
whole
mythology
of
martyrdoms
many
cruelties
were
imputed
to
emperors
under
whom
we
know
that
the
church
enjoyed
perfect
peace
a
long
period
of
civil
confusion
in
which
the
empire
seemed
to
be
tottering
to
its
fall
had
been
terminated
by
the
emperor
diocletian
who
by
his
radical
administrative
reforms
helped
to
preserve
the
roman
power
in
its
integrity
for
another
century
he
desired
to
support
his
work
of
political
consolidation
by
reviving
the
roman
spirit
and
he
attempted
to
infuse
new
life
into
the
official
religion
to
this
end
he
determined
to
suppress
the
growing
influence
of
the
christians
who
though
a
minority
were
very
numerous
and
he
organized
a
persecution
it
was
long
cruel
and
bloody
it
was
the
most
general
and
systematic
effort
to
crush
the
forbidden
faith
it
was
a
failure
the
christians
were
now
too
numerous
to
be
crushed
after
the
abdication
of
diocletian
the
emperors
who
reigned
in
different
parts
of
the
realm
did
not
agree
as
to
the
expediency
of
his
policy
and
the
persecution
ended
by
edicts
of
toleration
and
these
documents
have
an
interest
for
the
history
of
religious
liberty
the
first
issued
in
the
eastern
provinces
ran
as
follows
were
particularly
desirous
of
reclaiming
into
the
way
of
reason
and
nature
the
deluded
christians
who
had
renounced
the
religion
and
ceremonies
instituted
by
their
fathers
and
presumptuously
despising
the
practice
of
antiquity
had
invented
extravagant
laws
and
opinions
according
to
the
dictates
of
their
fancy
and
had
collected
a
various
society
from
the
different
provinces
of
our
empire
the
edicts
which
we
have
published
to
enforce
the
worship
of
the
gods
having
exposed
many
of
the
christians
to
danger
and
distress
many
having
suffered
death
and
many
more
who
still
persist
in
their
impious
folly
being
left
destitute
of
any
public
exercise
of
religion
we
are
disposed
to
extend
to
those
unhappy
men
the
effects
of
our
wonted
clemency
we
permit
them
therefore
freely
to
profess
their
private
opinions
and
to
assemble
in
their
conventicles
without
fear
or
molestation
provided
always
that
they
preserve
a
due
respect
to
the
established
laws
and
the
second
of
which
constantine
was
the
author
known
as
the
edict
of
milan
was
to
a
similar
effect
and
based
toleration
on
the
care
for
the
peace
and
happiness
of
his
subjects
and
on
the
hope
of
appeasing
the
deity
whose
seat
is
in
heaven
the
relations
between
the
roman
government
and
the
christians
raised
the
general
question
of
persecution
and
freedom
of
conscience
a
state
with
an
official
religion
but
perfectly
tolerant
of
all
creeds
and
cults
finds
that
a
society
had
arisen
in
its
midst
which
is
uncompromisingly
hostile
to
all
creeds
but
its
own
and
which
if
it
had
the
power
would
suppress
all
but
its
own
the
government
in
decides
to
check
the
dissemination
of
these
subversive
ideas
and
makes
the
profession
of
that
creed
a
crime
not
on
account
of
its
particular
tenets
but
on
account
of
the
social
consequences
of
those
tenets
the
members
of
the
society
can
not
without
violating
their
consciences
and
incurring
damnation
abandon
their
exclusive
doctrine
the
principle
of
freedom
of
conscience
is
asserted
as
superior
to
all
obligations
to
the
state
and
the
state
confronted
by
this
new
claim
is
unable
to
admit
it
persecution
is
the
result
even
from
the
standpoint
of
an
orthodox
and
loyal
pagan
the
persecution
of
the
christians
is
indefensible
because
blood
was
shed
uselessly
in
other
words
it
was
a
great
mistake
because
it
was
unsuccessful
for
persecution
is
a
choice
between
two
evils
the
alternatives
are
violence
which
no
reasonable
defender
of
persecution
would
deny
to
be
an
evil
in
itself
and
the
spread
of
dangerous
opinions
the
first
is
chosen
simply
to
avoid
the
second
on
the
ground
that
the
second
is
the
greater
evil
but
if
the
persecution
is
not
so
devised
and
carried
out
as
to
accomplish
its
end
then
you
have
two
evils
instead
of
one
and
nothing
can
justify
this
from
their
point
of
view
the
emperors
had
good
reasons
for
regarding
christianity
as
dangerous
and
but
they
should
either
have
let
it
alone
or
taken
systematic
measures
to
destroy
it
if
at
an
early
stage
they
had
established
a
drastic
and
systematic
inquisition
they
might
possibly
have
exterminated
it
this
at
least
would
have
been
statesmanlike
but
they
had
no
conception
of
extreme
measures
and
they
did
not
understand
had
no
experience
to
guide
them
sort
of
problem
they
had
to
deal
with
they
hoped
to
succeed
by
intimidation
their
attempts
at
suppression
were
vacillating
fitful
and
ridiculously
ineffectual
the
later
persecutions
of
and
had
no
prospect
of
success
it
is
particularly
to
be
observed
that
no
effort
was
made
to
suppress
christian
literature
the
higher
problem
whether
persecution
even
if
it
attains
the
desired
end
is
justifiable
was
not
considered
the
struggle
hinged
on
antagonism
between
the
conscience
of
the
individual
and
the
authority
and
supposed
interests
of
the
state
it
was
the
question
which
had
been
raised
by
socrates
raised
now
on
a
wider
platform
in
a
more
pressing
and
formidable
shape
what
is
to
happen
when
obedience
to
the
law
is
inconsistent
with
obedience
to
an
invisible
master
is
it
incumbent
on
the
state
to
respect
the
conscience
of
the
individual
at
all
costs
or
within
what
limits
the
christians
did
not
attempt
a
solution
the
general
problem
did
not
interest
them
they
claimed
the
right
of
freedom
exclusively
for
themselves
from
a
government
and
it
is
hardly
going
too
far
to
suspect
that
they
would
have
applauded
the
government
if
it
had
suppressed
the
gnostic
sects
whom
they
hated
and
calumniated
in
any
case
when
a
christian
state
was
established
they
would
completely
forget
the
principle
which
they
had
invoked
the
martyrs
died
for
conscience
but
not
for
liberty
the
greatest
of
the
churches
demands
freedom
of
conscience
in
the
modern
states
which
she
does
not
control
but
refuses
to
admit
that
where
she
had
the
power
it
would
be
incumbent
on
her
to
concede
it
if
we
review
the
history
of
classical
antiquity
as
a
whole
we
may
almost
say
that
freedom
of
thought
was
like
the
air
men
breathed
it
was
taken
for
granted
and
nobody
thought
about
it
if
seven
or
eight
thinkers
at
athens
were
penalized
for
heterodoxy
in
some
and
perhaps
in
most
of
these
cases
heterodoxy
was
only
a
pretext
they
do
not
invalidate
the
general
facts
that
the
advance
of
knowledge
was
not
impeded
by
prejudice
or
science
retarded
by
the
weight
of
unscientific
authority
the
educated
greeks
were
tolerant
because
they
were
friends
of
reason
and
did
not
set
up
any
authority
to
overrule
reason
opinions
were
not
imposed
except
by
argument
you
were
not
expected
to
receive
some
of
like
a
little
child
or
to
prostrate
your
intellect
before
an
authority
claiming
to
be
infallible
but
this
liberty
was
not
the
result
of
a
conscious
policy
or
deliberate
conviction
and
therefore
it
was
precarious
the
problems
of
freedom
of
thought
religious
liberty
toleration
had
not
been
forced
upon
society
and
were
never
seriously
considered
when
christianity
confronted
the
roman
government
no
one
saw
that
in
the
treatment
of
a
small
obscure
and
to
pagan
thinkers
uninteresting
or
repugnant
sect
a
principle
of
the
deepest
social
importance
was
involved
a
long
experience
of
the
theory
and
practice
of
persecution
was
required
to
base
securely
the
theory
of
freedom
of
thought
the
lurid
policy
of
coercion
which
the
christian
church
adopted
and
its
consequences
would
at
last
compel
reason
to
wrestle
with
the
problem
and
discover
the
justification
of
intellectual
liberty
the
spirit
of
the
greeks
and
romans
alive
in
their
works
would
after
a
long
period
of
obscuration
again
enlighten
the
world
and
aid
in
the
reign
of
reason
which
they
had
carelessly
enjoyed
without
assuring
its
foundations
this
has
been
shown
very
clearly
by
professor
jackson
in
the
article
on
in
the
encyclopoedia
britannica
last
edition
he
stated
the
theological
difficulty
as
to
the
origin
of
evil
in
this
form
god
either
wishes
to
abolish
evil
and
can
not
or
can
and
will
not
or
neither
can
nor
will
or
both
can
and
will
the
first
three
are
unthinkable
if
he
is
a
god
worthy
of
the
name
therefore
the
last
alternative
must
be
true
why
then
does
evil
exist
the
inference
is
that
there
is
no
god
in
the
sense
of
a
governor
of
the
world

chapter
iii
reason
in
prison
the
middle
ages
about
ten
years
after
the
edict
of
toleration
constantine
the
great
adopted
christianity
this
momentous
decision
inaugurated
a
millennium
in
which
reason
was
enchained
thought
was
enslaved
and
knowledge
made
no
progress
during
the
two
centuries
in
which
they
had
been
a
forbidden
sect
the
christians
had
claimed
toleration
on
the
ground
that
religious
belief
is
voluntary
and
not
a
thing
which
can
be
enforced
when
their
faith
became
the
predominant
creed
and
had
the
power
of
the
state
behind
it
they
abandoned
this
view
they
embarked
on
the
hopeful
enterprise
of
bringing
about
a
complete
uniformity
in
opinions
on
the
mysteries
of
the
universe
and
began
a
more
or
less
definite
policy
of
coercing
thought
this
policy
was
adopted
by
emperors
and
governments
partly
on
political
grounds
religious
divisions
bitter
as
they
were
seemed
dangerous
to
the
unity
of
the
state
but
the
fundamental
principle
lay
in
the
doctrine
that
salvation
is
to
be
found
exclusively
in
the
christian
church
the
profound
conviction
that
those
who
did
not
believe
in
its
doctrines
would
be
damned
eternally
and
that
god
punishes
theological
error
as
if
it
were
the
most
heinous
of
crimes
led
naturally
to
persecution
it
was
a
duty
to
impose
on
men
the
only
true
doctrine
seeing
that
their
own
eternal
interests
were
at
stake
and
to
hinder
errors
from
spreading
heretics
were
more
than
ordinary
criminals
and
the
pains
that
man
could
inflict
on
them
were
as
nothing
to
the
tortures
awaiting
them
in
hell
to
rid
the
earth
of
men
who
however
virtuous
were
through
their
religious
errors
enemies
of
the
almighty
was
a
plain
duty
their
virtues
were
no
excuse
we
must
remember
that
according
to
the
humane
doctrine
of
the
christians
pagan
that
is
merely
human
virtues
were
vices
and
infants
who
died
unbaptized
passed
the
rest
of
time
in
creeping
on
the
floor
of
hell
the
intolerance
arising
from
such
views
could
not
but
differ
in
kind
and
intensity
from
anything
that
the
world
had
yet
witnessed
besides
the
logic
of
its
doctrines
the
character
of
its
sacred
book
must
also
be
held
partly
accountable
for
the
intolerant
principles
of
the
christian
church
it
was
unfortunate
that
the
early
christians
had
included
in
their
scripture
the
jewish
writings
which
reflect
the
ideas
of
a
low
stage
of
civilization
and
are
full
of
savagery
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
how
much
harm
has
been
done
in
corrupting
the
morals
of
men
by
the
precepts
and
examples
of
inhumanity
violence
and
bigotry
which
the
reverent
reader
of
the
old
testament
implicitly
believing
in
its
inspiration
is
bound
to
approve
it
furnished
an
armoury
for
the
theory
of
persecution
the
truth
is
that
sacred
books
are
an
obstacle
to
moral
and
intellectual
progress
because
they
consecrate
the
ideas
of
a
given
epoch
and
its
customs
as
divinely
appointed
christianity
by
adopting
books
of
a
long
past
age

in
the
path
of

development

particularly
nasty

may
occur
to
one
to
wonder
how
history
might
have
been
altered

christians

cut
jehovah
out
of
their
programme

with
the

rejected
the
inspiration
of
the
old

who
in
his
brief
reign
sought
to

the
old

proclaimed
universal
toleration
but
he
placed
christians
at
a
disadvantage
by
forbidding
them
to
teach

schools
this
was
only
a
momentary
check

there
for

little

the
christians
were
more
concerned
in

in

guided

of
the
pope
he
must
be
coerced
his
lands
were
forfeited
and
his
dominions
were
thrown
open
to
be
seized
by
any
one
whom
the
church
could
induce
to
attack
him
the
popes
thus
established
a
theocratic
system
in
which
all
other
interests
were
to
be
subordinated
to
the
grand
duty
of
maintaining
the
purity
of
the
faith
but
in
order
to
root
out
heresy
it
was
necessary
to
discover
it
in
its
most
secret
retreats
the
albigeois
had
been
crushed
but
the
poison
of
their
doctrine
was
not
yet
destroyed
the
organized
system
of
searching
out
heretics
known
as
the
inquisition
was
founded
by
pope
gregory
ix
about
and
fully
established
by
a
bull
of
innocent
iv
which
regulated
the
machinery
of
persecution
an
integral
part
of
the
social
edifice
in
every
city
and
every
this
powerful
engine
for
the
suppression
of
the
freedom
of
religious
opinions
is
unique
in
history
the
bishops
were
not
equal
to
the
new
talk
undertaken
by
the
church
and
in
every
ecclesiastical
province
suitable
monks
were
selected
and
to
them
was
delegated
the
authority
of
the
pope
for
discovering
heretics
these
inquisitors
had
unlimited
authority
they
were
subject
to
no
supervision
and
responsible
to
no
man
it
would
not
have
been
easy
to
establish
this
system
but
for
the
fact
that
contemporary
secular
rulers
had
inaugurated
independently
a
merciless
legislation
against
heresy
the
emperor
frederick
ii
who
was
himself
undoubtedly
a
freethinker
made
laws
for
his
extensive
dominions
in
italy
and
germany
between
and
enacting
that
all
heretics
should
be
outlawed
that
those
who
did
not
recant
should
be
burned
those
who
recanted
should
be
imprisoned
but
if
they
relapsed
should
be
executed
that
their
property
should
be
confiscated
their
houses
destroyed
and
their
children
to
the
second
generation
ineligible
to
positions
of
emolument
unless
they
had
betrayed
their
father
or
some
other
heretic
legislation
consecrated
the
stake
as
the
proper
punishment
for
heresy
this
cruel
form
of
death
for
that
crime
seems
to
have
been
first
inflicted
on
heretics
by
a
french
king
we
must
remember
that
in
the
middle
ages
and
much
later
crimes
of
all
kinds
were
punished
with
the
utmost
cruelty
in
england
in
the
reign
of
henry
viii
there
is
a
case
of
prisoners
being
boiled
to
death
heresy
was
the
foulest
of
all
crimes
and
to
prevail
against
it
was
to
prevail
against
the
legions
of
hell
the
cruel
enactments
against
heretics
were
strongly
supported
by
the
public
opinion
of
the
masses
when
the
inquisition
was
fully
developed
it
covered
western
christendom
with
a
net
from
the
meshes
of
which
it
was
difficult
for
a
heretic
to
escape
the
inquisitors
in
the
various
kingdoms
and
communicated
information
there
was
chain
of
tribunals
throughout
continental
england
stood
outside
the
system
but
from
the
age
of
henry
iv
and
henry
v
the
government
repressed
heresy
by
the
stake
under
a
special
statute
repealed
revived
under
mary
finally
repealed
in
in
its
task
of
imposing
unity
of
belief
the
inquisition
was
most
successful
in
spain
here
towards
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
a
system
was
instituted
which
had
peculiarities
of
its
own
and
was
very
jealous
of
roman
interference
one
of
the
achievements
of
the
spanish
inquisition
which
was
not
abolished
till
the
nineteenth
century
was
to
expel
the
moriscos
or
converted
moors
who
retained
many
of
their
old
mohammedan
opinions
and
customs
it
is
also
said
to
have
eradicated
judaism
and
to
have
preserved
the
country
from
the
zeal
of
protestant
missionaries
but
it
can
not
be
proved
that
it
deserves
the
credit
of
having
protected
spain
against
protestantism
for
it
is
quite
possible
that
if
the
seeds
of
protestant
opinion
had
been
sown
they
would
in
any
case
have
fallen
dead
on
an
uncongenial
soil
freedom
of
thought
however
was
entirely
suppressed
one
of
the
most
efficacious
means
for
hunting
down
heresy
was
the
of
faith
which
enlisted
the
people
in
the
service
of
the
inquisition
and
required
every
man
to
be
an
informer
from
time
to
time
a
certain
district
was
visited
and
an
edict
issued
commanding
those
who
knew
anything
of
any
heresy
to
come
forward
and
reveal
it
under
fearful
penalties
temporal
and
spiritual
in
consequence
no
one
was
free
from
the
suspicion
of
his
neighbours
or
even
of
his
own
family
more
ingenious
device
has
been
invented
to
subjugate
a
whole
population
to
paralyze
its
intellect
and
to
reduce
it
to
blind
obedience
it
elevated
delation
to
the
rank
of
high
religious
the
process
employed
in
the
trials
of
those
accused
of
heresy
in
spain
rejected
every
reasonable
means
for
the
ascertainment
of
truth
the
prisoner
was
assumed
to
be
guilty
the
burden
of
proving
his
innocence
rested
on
him
his
judge
was
virtually
his
prosecutor
all
witnesses
against
him
however
infamous
were
admitted
the
rules
for
allowing
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
were
lax
those
for
rejecting
witnesses
for
the
defence
were
rigid
jews
moriscos
and
servants
could
give
evidence
against
the
prisoner
but
not
for
him
and
the
same
rule
applied
to
kinsmen
to
the
fourth
degree
the
principle
on
which
the
inquisition
proceeded
was
that
better
a
hundred
innocent
should
suffer
than
one
guilty
person
escape
indulgences
were
granted
to
any
one
who
contributed
wood
to
the
pile
but
the
tribunal
of
the
inquisition
did
not
itself
condemn
to
the
stake
for
the
church
must
not
be
guilty
of
the
shedding
of
blood
the
ecclesiastical
judge
pronounced
the
prisoner
to
be
a
heretic
of
whose
conversion
there
was
no
hope
and
handed
him
over
him
was
the
official
term
to
the
secular
authority
asking
and
charging
the
magistrate
treat
him
benignantly
and
but
this
formal
plea
for
mercy
could
not
be
entertained
by
the
civil
power
it
had
no
choice
but
to
inflict
death
if
it
did
otherwise
it
was
a
promoter
of
heresy
all
princes
and
officials
according
to
the
canon
law
must
punish
duly
and
promptly
heretics
handed
over
to
them
by
the
inquisition
under
pain
of
excommunication
it
is
to
be
noted
that
the
number
of
deaths
at
the
stake
has
been
much
by
popular
imagination
but
the
sum
of
suffering
caused
by
the
methods
of
the
system
and
the
punishments
that
fell
short
of
death
can
hardly
be
exaggerated
the
legal
processes
employed
by
the
church
in
these
persecutions
exercised
a
corrupting
influence
on
the
criminal
jurisprudence
of
the
continent
lea
the
historian
of
the
inquisition
observes
all
the
curses
which
the
inquisition
brought
in
its
train
this
perhaps
was
the
until
the
closing
years
of
the
eighteenth
century
throughout
the
greater
part
of
europe
the
inquisitorial
process
as
developed
for
the
destruction
of
heresy
became
the
customary
method
of
dealing
with
all
who
were
under
any
the
inquisitors
who
as
gibbon
says
nonsense
by
cruelties
are
often
regarded
as
monsters
it
may
be
said
for
them
and
for
the
kings
who
did
their
will
that
they
were
not
a
bit
worse
than
the
priests
and
monarchs
of
primitive
ages
who
sacrificed
human
beings
to
their
deities
the
greek
king
agamemnon
who
immolated
his
daughter
iphigenia
to
obtain
favourable
winds
from
the
gods
was
perhaps
a
most
affectionate
father
and
the
seer
who
advised
him
to
do
so
may
have
been
a
man
of
high
integrity
they
acted
according
to
their
beliefs
and
so
in
the
middle
ages
and
afterwards
men
of
kindly
temper
and
the
purest
zeal
for
morality
were
absolutely
devoid
of
mercy
where
heresy
was
suspected
hatred
of
heresy
was
a
sort
of
infectious
germ
generated
by
the
doctrine
of
exclusive
salvation
it
has
been
observed
that
this
dogma
also
injured
the
sense
of
truth
as
eternal
fate
was
at
stake
it
seemed
plainly
legitimate
or
rather
imperative
to
use
any
means
to
enforce
the
true
falsehood
and
imposture
there
was
no
scruple
about
the
invention
of
miracles
or
any
fictions
that
were
edifying
a
disinterested
appreciation
of
truth
will
not
begin
to
prevail
till
the
seventeenth
century
while
this
principle
with
the
associated
doctrines
of
sin
hell
and
the
last
judgment
led
to
such
consequences
there
were
other
doctrines
and
implications
in
christianity
which
forming
a
solid
rampart
against
the
advance
of
knowledge
blocked
the
paths
of
science
in
the
middle
ages
and
obstructed
its
progress
till
the
latter
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
every
important
field
of
scientific
research
the
ground
was
occupied
by
false
views
which
the
church
declared
to
be
true
on
the
infallible
authority
of
the
bible
the
jewish
account
of
creation
and
the
fall
of
man
inextricably
bound
up
with
the
christian
theory
of
redemption
excluded
from
free
inquiry
geology
zoology
and
anthropology
the
literal
interpretation
of
the
bible
involved
the
truth
that
the
sun
revolves
round
the
earth
the
church
condemned
the
theory
of
the
antipodes
one
of
the
charges
against
servetus
who
was
burned
in
the
sixteenth
century
see
below
was
that
he
believed
the
statement
of
a
greek
geographer
that
judea
is
a
wretched
barren
country
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
bible
describes
it
as
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
the
greek
physician
hippocrates
had
based
the
study
of
medicine
and
disease
on
experience
and
methodical
research
in
the
middle
ages
men
relapsed
to
the
primitive
notions
of
a
barbarous
age
bodily
ailments
were
ascribed
to
occult
malice
of
the
devil
or
the
wrath
of
god
augustine
said
that
the
diseases
of
christians
were
caused
by
demons
and
luther
in
the
same
way
attributed
them
to
satan
it
was
only
logical
that
supernatural
remedies
should
be
sought
to
counteract
the
effects
of
supernatural
causes
there
was
an
immense
traffic
in
relics
with
miraculous
virtues
and
this
had
the
advantage
of
bringing
in
a
large
revenue
to
the
church
physicians
were
often
exposed
to
suspicions
of
sorcery
and
unbelief
anatomy
was
forbidden
partly
perhaps
on
account
of
the
doctrine
of
the
resurrection
of
the
body
the
opposition
of
ecclesiastics
to
inoculation
in
the
eighteenth
century
was
a
survival
of
the
mediaeval
view
of
disease
chemistry
alchemy
was
considered
a
diabolical
art
and
in
was
condemned
by
the
pope
the
long
imprisonment
of
roger
bacon
thirteenth
century
who
while
he
professed
zeal
for
orthodoxy
had
an
inconvenient
instinct
for
scientific
research
illustrates
the
mediaeval
distrust
of
science
it
is
possible
that
the
knowledge
of
nature
would
have
progressed
little
even
if
this
distrust
of
science
on
theological
grounds
had
not
prevailed
for
greek
science
had
ceased
to
advance
five
hundred
years
before
christianity
became
powerful
after
about
no
important
discoveries
were
made
the
explanation
of
this
decay
is
not
easy
but
we
may
be
sure
that
it
is
to
be
sought
in
the
social
conditions
of
the
greek
and
roman
world
and
we
may
suspect
that
the
social
conditions
of
the
middle
ages
would
have
proved
unfavourable
to
the
scientific
the
disinterested
quest
of
if
the
controlling
beliefs
had
not
been
hostile
we
may
suspect
that
the
rebirth
of
science
would
in
any
case
have
been
postponed
till
new
social
conditions
which
began
to
appear
in
the
thirteenth
century
see
next
chapter
had
reached
a
certain
maturity
theological
prejudice
may
have
injured
knowledge
principally
by
its
survival
after
the
middle
ages
had
passed
away
in
other
words
the
harm
done
by
christian
doctrines
in
this
respect
may
lie
less
in
the
obscurantism
of
the
dark
interval
between
ancient
and
modern
civilization
than
in
the
obstructions
which
they
offered
when
science
had
revived
in
spite
of
them
and
could
no
longer
be
crushed
the
firm
belief
in
witchcraft
magic
and
demons
was
inherited
by
the
middle
ages
from
antiquity
but
it
became
far
more
lurid
and
made
the
world
terrible
men
believed
that
they
were
surrounded
by
fiends
watching
for
every
opportunity
to
harm
them
that
pestilences
storms
eclipses
and
famines
were
the
work
of
the
devil
but
they
believed
as
firmly
that
ecclesiastical
rites
were
capable
of
coping
with
these
enemies
some
of
the
early
christian
emperors
legislated
against
magic
but
till
the
fourteenth
century
there
was
no
systematic
attempt
to
root
out
witchcraft
the
fearful
epidemic
known
as
the
black
death
which
devastated
europe
in
that
century
seems
to
have
aggravated
the
haunting
terror
of
the
invisible
world
of
demons
trials
for
witchcraft
multiplied
and
for
three
hundred
years
the
discovery
of
witchcraft
and
the
destruction
of
those
who
were
accused
of
practising
it
chiefly
women
was
a
standing
feature
of
european
civilization
both
the
theory
and
the
persecution
were
supported
by
holy
scripture
shalt
not
suffer
a
witch
to
was
the
clear
injunction
of
the
highest
authority
pope
innocent
viii
issued
a
bull
on
the
matter
in
which
he
asserted
that
plagues
and
storms
are
the
work
of
witches
and
the
ablest
minds
believed
in
the
reality
of
their
devilish
powers
no
story
is
more
painful
than
the
persecution
of
witches
and
nowhere
was
it
more
atrocious
than
in
england
and
scotland
i
mention
it
because
it
was
the
direct
result
of
theological
doctrines
and
because
as
we
shall
see
it
was
rationalism
which
brought
the
long
chapter
of
horrors
to
an
end
in
the
period
then
in
which
the
church
exercised
its
greatest
influence
reason
was
enchained
in
the
prison
which
christianity
had
built
around
the
human
mind
it
was
not
indeed
inactive
but
its
activity
took
the
form
of
heresy
or
to
pursue
the
metaphor
those
who
broke
chains
were
unable
for
the
most
part
to
scale
the
walls
of
the
prison
their
freedom
extended
only
so
far
as
to
arrive
at
beliefs
which
like
orthodoxy
itself
were
based
on
christian
mythology
there
were
some
exceptions
to
the
rule
at
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
a
stimulus
from
another
world
began
to
make
itself
felt
the
philosophy
of
aristotle
became
known
to
learned
men
in
western
christendom
their
teachers
were
jews
and
mohammedans
among
the
mohammedans
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
free
thought
provoked
by
their
knowledge
of
ancient
greek
speculation
the
works
of
the
freethinker
averroes
twelfth
century
which
were
based
on
philosophy
propagated
a
small
wave
of
rationalism
in
christian
countries
averroes
held
the
eternity
of
matter
and
denied
the
immortality
of
the
soul
his
general
view
may
be
described
as
pantheism
but
he
sought
to
avoid
difficulties
with
the
orthodox
authorities
of
islam
by
laying
down
the
doctrine
of
double
truth
that
is
the
coexistence
of
two
independent
and
contradictory
truths
the
one
philosophical
and
the
other
religious
this
did
not
save
him
from
being
banished
from
the
court
of
the
spanish
caliph
in
the
university
of
paris
his
teaching
produced
a
school
of
freethinkers
who
held
that
the
creation
the
resurrection
of
the
body
and
other
essential
dogmas
might
be
true
from
the
standpoint
of
religion
but
are
false
from
the
standpoint
of
reason
to
a
plain
mind
this
seems
much
as
if
one
said
that
the
doctrine
of
immortality
is
true
on
sundays
but
not
on
or
that
the
creed
is
false
in
the
and
true
in
the
kitchen
this
dangerous
movement
was
crushed
and
the
saving
principle
of
double
truth
condemned
by
pope
john
xxi
the
spread
of
averroistic
and
similar
speculations
called
forth
the
theology
of
thomas
of
aquino
in
south
italy
died
a
most
subtle
thinker
whose
mind
had
a
natural
turn
for
scepticism
he
enlisted
aristotle
hitherto
the
guide
of
infidelity
on
the
side
of
orthodoxy
and
constructed
an
ingenious
christian
philosophy
which
is
still
authoritative
in
the
roman
church
but
aristotle
and
reason
are
dangerous
allies
for
faith
and
the
treatise
of
thomas
is
perhaps
more
calculated
to
unsettle
a
believing
mind
by
the
doubts
which
it
powerfully
states
than
to
quiet
the
scruples
of
a
doubter
by
its
solutions
there
must
always
have
been
some
private
and
underground
unbelief
here
and
there
which
did
not
lead
to
any
serious
consequences
the
blasphemous
statement
that
the
world
had
been
deceived
by
three
impostors
moses
jesus
and
mohammed
was
current
in
the
thirteenth
century
it
was
attributed
to
the
freethinking
emperor
frederick
ii
died
who
has
been
described
as
first
modern
the
same
idea
in
a
milder
form
was
expressed
in
the
story
of
the
three
rings
which
is
at
least
as
old
a
mohammedan
ruler
desiring
to
extort
money
from
a
rich
jew
summoned
him
to
his
court
and
laid
a
snare
for
him
friend
he
said
have
often
heard
it
reported
that
thou
art
a
very
wise
man
tell
me
therefore
which
of
the
three
religions
that
of
the
jews
that
of
the
mohammedans
and
that
of
the
christians
thou
believest
to
be
the
the
jew
saw
that
a
trap
was
laid
for
him
and
answered
as
follows
lord
there
was
once
a
rich
man
who
among
his
treasures
had
a
ring
of
such
great
value
that
he
wished
to
leave
it
as
a
perpetual
heirloom
to
his
successors
so
he
made
a
will
that
whichever
of
his
sons
should
be
found
in
possession
of
this
ring
after
his
death
should
be
considered
his
heir
the
son
to
whom
he
gave
the
ring
acted
in
the
same
way
as
his
father
and
so
the
ring
passed
from
hand
to
hand
at
last
it
came
into
the
possession
of
a
man
who
had
three
sons
whom
he
loved
equally
unable
to
make
up
his
mind
to
which
of
them
he
should
leave
the
ring
he
promised
it
to
each
of
them
privately
and
then
in
order
to
satisfy
them
all
caused
a
goldsmith
to
make
two
other
rings
so
closely
resembling
the
true
ring
that
he
was
unable
to
distinguish
them
himself
on
his
he
gave
each
of
them
a
ring
and
each
claimed
to
be
his
heir
but
no
one
could
prove
his
title
because
the
rings
were
indistinguishable
and
the
suit
at
law
lasts
till
this
day
it
is
even
so
my
lord
with
the
three
religions
given
by
god
to
the
three
peoples
they
each
think
they
have
the
true
religion
but
which
of
them
really
has
it
is
a
question
like
that
of
the
rings
still
this
sceptical
story
became
famous
in
the
eighteenth
century
when
the
german
poet
lessing
built
upon
it
his
drama
nathan
the
sage
which
was
intended
to
show
the
unreasonableness
of
intolerance
chapter
iv
prospect
of
deliverance
the
renaissance
and
the
reformation
the
intellectual
and
social
movement
which
was
to
dispel
the
darkness
of
the
middle
ages
and
prepare
the
way
for
those
who
would
ultimately
deliver
reason
from
her
prison
began
in
italy
in
the
thirteenth
century
the
misty
veil
woven
of
credulity
and
infantile
naïveté
which
had
hung
over
souls
and
protected
them
from
understanding
either
themselves
or
their
relation
to
the
world
began
to
lift
the
individual
began
to
feel
his
separate
individuality
to
be
conscious
of
his
own
value
as
a
person
apart
from
his
race
or
country
as
in
the
later
ages
of
greece
and
rome
and
the
world
around
him
began
to
emerge
from
the
mists
of
mediaeval
dreams
the
change
was
due
to
the
political
and
social
conditions
of
the
little
italian
states
of
which
some
were
republics
and
others
governed
by
tyrants
to
the
human
world
thus
unveiling
itself
the
individual
who
sought
to
make
it
serve
his
purposes
required
a
guide
and
the
guide
was
found
in
the
ancient
literature
of
greece
and
rome
hence
the
whole
transformation
which
presently
extended
from
italy
to
northern
europe
is
known
as
the
renaissance
or
rebirth
of
classical
antiquity
but
the
awakened
interest
in
classical
literature
while
it
coloured
the
character
and
stimulated
the
growth
of
the
movement
supplying
new
ideals
and
suggesting
new
points
of
view
was
only
the
form
in
which
the
change
of
spirit
began
to
express
itself
in
the
fourteenth
century
the
change
might
conceivably
have
taken
some
other
shape
its
true
name
is
humanism
at
the
time
men
hardly
felt
that
they
were
passing
into
a
new
age
of
civilization
nor
did
the
culture
of
the
renaissance
immediately
produce
any
open
or
general
intellectual
rebellion
against
orthodox
beliefs
the
world
was
gradually
assuming
an
aspect
decidedly
unfriendly
to
the
teaching
of
mediaeval
orthodoxy
but
there
was
no
explosion
of
hostility
it
was
not
till
the
seventeenth
century
that
war
between
religion
and
authority
was
systematically
waged
the
humanists
were
not
hostile
to
theological
authority
or
to
the
claims
of
religious
dogma
but
they
had
discovered
a
purely
human
curiosity
about
this
world
and
it
absorbed
their
interest
they
idolized
pagan
literature
which
abounded
in
poisonous
germs
the
secular
side
of
education
became
religion
and
theology
were
kept
in
a
separate
compartment
some
speculative
minds
which
were
sensitive
to
the
contradiction
might
seek
to
reconcile
the
old
religion
with
new
ideas
but
the
general
tendency
of
thinkers
in
the
renaissance
period
was
to
keep
the
two
worlds
distinct
and
to
practise
outward
conformity
to
the
creed
without
any
real
intellectual
submission
i
may
illustrate
this
of
the
renaissance
by
montaigne
second
half
of
sixteenth
century
his
essays
make
for
rationalism
but
contain
frequent
professions
of
orthodox
catholicism
in
which
he
was
perfectly
sincere
there
is
no
attempt
to
reconcile
the
two
points
of
view
in
fact
he
takes
the
sceptical
position
that
there
is
no
bridge
between
reason
and
religion
the
human
intellect
is
incapable
in
the
domain
of
theology
and
religion
must
be
placed
aloft
out
of
reach
and
beyond
the
interference
of
reason
to
be
humbly
accepted
but
while
he
humbly
accepted
it
on
sceptical
grounds
which
would
have
induced
him
to
accept
mohammadanism
if
he
had
been
born
in
cairo
his
soul
was
not
in
its
dominion
it
was
the
philosophers
and
wise
men
of
antiquity
cicero
and
seneca
and
plutarch
who
moulded
and
possessed
his
mind
it
is
to
them
and
not
to
the
consolations
of
christianity
that
he
turns
when
he
discusses
the
problem
of
death
the
religious
wars
in
france
which
he
witnessed
and
the
massacre
of
day
were
calculated
to
confirm
him
in
his
scepticism
his
attitude
to
persecution
is
expressed
in
the
remark
that
is
setting
a
high
value
on
opinions
to
roast
men
on
account
of
the
logical
results
of
scepticism
were
made
visible
by
his
friend
charron
who
published
a
book
on
wisdom
in
here
it
is
taught
that
true
morality
is
not
founded
on
religion
and
the
author
surveys
the
history
of
christianity
to
show
the
evils
which
it
had
produced
he
says
of
immortality
that
it
is
the
most
generally
received
doctrine
the
most
usefully
believed
and
the
most
weakly
established
by
human
reasons
but
he
modified
this
and
some
other
passages
in
a
second
edition
a
contemporary
jesuit
placed
charron
in
the
catalogue
of
the
most
dangerous
and
wicked
atheists
he
was
really
a
deist
but
in
those
days
and
long
after
no
one
scrupled
to
call
a
christian
deist
an
atheist
his
book
would
doubtless
have
been
suppressed
and
he
would
have
suffered
but
for
the
support
of
king
henry
iv
it
has
a
particular
interest
because
it
transports
us
directly
from
the
atmosphere
of
the
renaissance
represented
by
montaigne
into
the
new
age
of
more
or
less
aggressive
rationalism
what
humanism
did
in
the
fourteenth
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
at
first
in
italy
then
in
other
countries
was
to
create
an
intellectual
atmosphere
in
which
the
emancipation
of
reason
could
begin
and
knowledge
could
resume
its
progress
the
period
saw
the
invention
of
printing
and
the
discovery
of
new
parts
of
the
globe
and
these
things
were
to
aid
powerfully
in
the
future
defeat
of
authority
but
the
triumph
of
freedom
depended
on
other
causes
also
it
was
not
to
be
brought
about
by
the
intellect
alone
the
chief
political
facts
of
the
period
were
the
decline
of
the
power
of
the
pope
in
europe
the
decay
of
the
holy
roman
empire
and
the
growth
of
strong
monarchies
in
which
worldly
interests
determined
and
dictated
ecclesiastical
policy
and
from
which
the
modern
state
was
to
develop
the
success
of
the
reformation
was
made
possible
by
these
conditions
its
victory
in
north
germany
was
due
to
the
secular
interest
of
the
princes
who
profited
by
the
confiscation
of
church
lands
in
england
there
was
no
popular
movement
the
change
was
carried
through
by
the
government
for
its
own
purposes
the
principal
cause
of
the
reformation
was
the
general
corruption
of
the
church
and
the
flagrancy
of
its
oppression
for
a
long
time
the
papacy
had
had
no
higher
aim
than
to
be
a
secular
power
exploiting
its
spiritual
authority
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
its
worldly
interests
by
which
it
was
exclusively
governed
all
the
european
states
based
their
diplomacy
on
this
assumption
since
the
fourteenth
century
every
one
acknowledged
the
need
of
reforming
the
church
and
reform
had
been
promised
but
things
went
from
bad
to
worse
and
there
was
no
resource
but
rebellion
the
rebellion
led
by
luther
was
the
result
not
of
a
revolt
of
reason
against
dogmas
but
of
widely
spread
feeling
due
to
the
ecclesiastical
methods
of
extorting
money
particularly
by
the
sale
of
indulgences
the
most
glaring
abuse
of
the
time
it
was
his
study
of
the
theory
of
papal
indulgences
that
led
luther
on
to
his
theological
heresies
it
is
an
elementary
error
but
one
which
is
still
shared
by
many
people
who
have
read
history
superficially
that
the
reformation
established
religious
liberty
and
the
right
of
private
judgment
what
it
did
was
to
bring
about
a
new
set
of
political
and
social
conditions
under
which
religious
liberty
could
ultimately
be
secured
and
by
virtue
of
its
inherent
inconsistencies
to
lead
to
results
at
which
its
leaders
would
have
shuddered
but
nothing
was
further
from
the
minds
of
the
leading
reformers
than
the
toleration
of
doctrines
differing
from
their
own
they
replaced
one
authority
by
another
they
set
up
the
authority
of
the
bible
instead
of
that
of
the
church
but
it
was
the
bible
according
to
luther
or
the
bible
according
to
calvin
so
far
as
the
spirit
of
intolerance
went
there
was
nothing
to
choose
between
the
new
and
the
old
churches
the
religious
wars
were
not
for
the
cause
of
freedom
but
for
particular
sets
of
doctrines
and
in
france
if
the
protestants
had
been
victorious
it
is
certain
that
they
would
not
have
given
more
liberal
terms
to
the
catholics
than
the
catholics
gave
to
them
luther
was
quite
opposed
to
liberty
of
conscience
and
worship
a
doctrine
which
was
inconsistent
with
scripture
as
he
read
it
he
might
protest
against
coercion
and
condemn
the
burning
of
heretics
when
he
was
in
fear
that
he
and
his
party
might
be
victims
but
when
he
was
safe
and
in
power
he
asserted
his
real
view
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
state
to
impose
the
true
doctrine
and
exterminate
heresy
which
was
an
abomination
that
unlimited
obedience
to
their
prince
in
religious
as
in
other
matters
was
the
duty
of
subjects
and
that
the
end
of
the
state
was
to
defend
the
faith
he
held
that
anabaptists
should
be
put
to
the
sword
with
protestants
and
catholics
alike
the
dogma
of
exclusive
salvation
led
to
the
same
place
fame
for
intolerance
is
blackest
he
did
not
like
luther
advocate
the
absolute
power
of
the
civil
ruler
he
stood
for
the
control
of
the
state
by
the
form
of
government
which
is
commonly
called
theocracy
and
he
established
a
theocracy
at
geneva
here
liberty
was
completely
crushed
false
doctrines
were
put
down
by
imprisonment
exile
and
death
the
punishment
of
servetus
is
the
most
famous
exploit
of
warfare
against
heresy
the
spaniard
servetus
who
had
written
against
the
dogma
of
the
trinity
was
imprisoned
at
lyons
partly
through
the
machinations
of
calvin
and
having
escaped
came
rashly
to
geneva
he
was
tried
for
heresy
and
committed
to
the
flames
though
geneva
had
no
jurisdiction
over
him
melanchthon
who
formulated
the
principles
of
persecution
praised
this
act
as
a
memorable
example
to
posterity
posterity
however
was
one
day
to
be
ashamed
of
that
example
in
the
calvinists
of
geneva
felt
impelled
to
erect
an
expiatory
monument
in
which
calvin
great
is
excused
as
guilty
of
an
error
was
that
of
his
thus
the
reformers
like
the
church
from
which
they
parted
cared
nothing
for
freedom
they
only
cared
for
if
the
mediaeval
ideal
was
to
purge
the
world
of
heretics
the
object
of
the
protestant
was
to
exclude
all
dissidents
from
his
own
land
the
people
at
large
were
to
be
driven
into
a
fold
to
accept
their
faith
at
the
command
of
their
sovran
this
was
the
principle
laid
down
in
the
religious
peace
which
composed
the
struggle
between
the
catholic
emperor
and
the
protestant
german
princes
it
was
recognized
by
catherine
medici
when
she
massacred
the
french
protestants
and
signified
to
queen
elizabeth
that
she
might
do
likewise
with
english
catholics
nor
did
the
protestant
creeds
represent
enlightenment
the
reformation
on
the
continent
was
as
hostile
to
enlightenment
as
it
was
to
liberty
and
science
if
it
seemed
to
contradict
the
bible
has
as
little
chance
with
luther
as
with
the
pope
the
bible
interpreted
by
the
protestants
or
the
roman
church
was
equally
fatal
to
witches
in
germany
the
development
of
learning
received
a
long
yet
the
reformation
involuntarily
helped
the
cause
of
liberty
the
result
was
contrary
to
the
intentions
of
its
leaders
was
indirect
and
long
delayed
in
the
first
place
the
great
rent
in
western
christianity
substituting
a
number
of
theological
authorities
instead
of
gods
we
may
say
instead
of
one
a
weakening
of
ecclesiastical
authority
in
general
the
religious
tradition
was
broken
in
the
second
place
in
the
protestant
states
the
supreme
ecclesiastical
power
was
vested
in
the
sovran
the
sovran
had
other
interests
besides
those
of
the
church
to
consider
and
political
reasons
would
compel
him
sooner
or
later
to
modify
the
principle
of
ecclesiastical
intolerance
catholic
states
in
the
same
way
were
forced
to
depart
from
the
duty
of
not
suffering
heretics
the
religious
wars
in
france
ended
in
a
limited
toleration
of
protestants
the
policy
of
cardinal
richelieu
who
supported
the
protestant
cause
in
germany
illustrates
how
secular
interests
obstructed
the
cause
of
faith
again
the
intellectual
justification
of
the
protestant
rebellion
against
the
church
had
been
the
right
of
private
judgment
that
is
the
principle
of
religious
liberty
but
the
reformers
had
asserted
it
only
for
themselves
and
as
soon
as
they
had
framed
their
own
articles
of
faith
they
had
practically
repudiated
it
this
was
the
most
glaring
inconsistency
in
the
protestant
position
and
the
claim
which
they
had
thrust
aside
could
not
be
permanently
suppressed
once
more
the
protestant
doctrines
rested
on
an
insecure
foundation
which
no
logic
could
defend
and
inevitably
led
from
one
untenable
position
to
another
if
we
are
to
believe
on
authority
why
should
we
prefer
the
upstart
dictation
of
the
lutheran
confession
of
augsburg
or
the
english
nine
articles
to
the
venerable
authority
of
the
church
of
rome
if
we
decide
against
rome
we
must
do
so
by
means
of
reason
but
once
we
exercise
reason
in
the
matter
why
should
we
stop
where
luther
or
calvin
or
any
of
the
other
rebels
stopped
unless
we
assume
that
one
of
them
was
inspired
if
we
reject
superstitions
which
they
rejected
there
is
nothing
except
their
authority
to
prevent
us
from
rejecting
all
or
some
of
the
superstitions
which
they
retained
moreover
their
promoted
results
which
they
did
not
foresee
the
inspired
record
on
which
the
creeds
depend
became
an
open
book
public
attention
was
directed
to
it
as
never
before
though
it
can
not
be
said
to
have
been
universally
read
before
the
nineteenth
century
study
led
to
criticism
the
difficulties
of
the
dogma
of
inspiration
were
appreciated
and
the
bible
was
ultimately
to
be
submitted
to
a
remorseless
dissection
which
has
altered
at
least
the
quality
of
its
authority
in
the
eyes
of
intelligent
believers
this
process
of
biblical
criticism
has
been
conducted
mainly
in
a
protestant
atmosphere
and
the
new
position
in
which
the
bible
was
placed
by
the
reformation
must
be
held
partly
accountable
in
these
ways
protestantism
was
adapted
to
be
a
to
rationalism
and
thus
served
the
cause
of
freedom
that
cause
however
was
powerfully
and
directly
promoted
by
one
sect
of
reformers
who
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
others
were
blasphemers
and
of
whom
most
people
never
think
when
they
talk
of
the
reformation
i
mean
the
socinians
of
their
influence
something
will
be
said
in
the
next
chapter
another
result
of
the
reformation
has
still
to
be
mentioned
its
renovating
effect
on
the
roman
church
which
had
now
to
fight
for
its
existence
a
new
series
of
popes
who
were
in
earnest
about
religion
began
with
paul
iii
and
reorganized
the
papacy
and
its
resources
for
a
struggle
of
centuries
the
institution
of
the
jesuit
order
the
establishment
of
the
inquisition
at
rome
the
council
of
trent
the
censorship
of
the
press
index
of
forbidden
books
were
the
expression
of
the
new
spirit
and
the
means
to
cope
with
the
new
situation
the
reformed
papacy
was
good
fortune
for
believing
children
of
the
church
but
what
here
concerns
us
is
that
one
of
its
chief
objects
was
to
repress
freedom
more
effectually
savonarola
who
preached
right
living
at
florence
had
been
executed
under
pope
alexander
vi
who
was
a
notorious
profligate
if
savonarola
had
lived
in
the
new
era
he
might
have
been
canonized
but
giordano
bruno
was
burned
giordano
bruno
had
constructed
a
religious
philosophy
based
partly
upon
epicurus
from
whom
he
took
the
theory
of
the
infinity
of
the
universe
but
epicurean
materialism
was
transformed
into
a
pantheistic
mysticism
by
the
doctrine
that
god
is
the
soul
of
matter
accepting
the
recent
discovery
of
copernicus
which
catholics
and
protestants
alike
rejected
that
the
earth
revolves
round
the
sun
bruno
took
the
further
step
of
regarding
the
fixed
stars
as
suns
each
with
its
invisible
satellites
he
sought
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
the
bible
which
he
held
being
intended
for
the
vulgar
had
to
accommodate
itself
to
their
prejudices
leaving
italy
because
he
was
suspected
of
heresy
he
lived
successively
in
switzerland
france
england
and
germany
and
in
induced
by
a
false
friend
to
return
to
venice
he
was
seized
by
order
of
the
inquisition
finally
condemned
in
rome
he
was
burned
in
the
campo
fiori
where
a
monument
now
stands
in
his
honour
erected
some
years
ago
to
the
great
chagrin
of
the
roman
church
much
is
made
of
the
fate
of
bruno
because
he
is
one
of
the
famous
men
no
country
has
so
illustrious
a
victim
of
that
era
to
commemorate
as
italy
but
in
other
lands
blood
just
as
innocent
was
shed
for
heterodox
opinions
in
france
there
was
rather
more
freedom
than
elsewhere
under
the
relatively
tolerant
government
of
henry
iv
and
of
the
cardinals
richelieu
and
mazarin
till
about
but
at
toulouse
lucilio
vanini
a
learned
italian
who
like
bruno
wandered
about
europe
was
convicted
as
an
atheist
and
blasphemer
his
tongue
was
torn
out
and
he
was
burned
protestant
england
under
elizabeth
and
james
i
did
not
lag
behind
the
roman
inquisition
but
on
account
of
the
obscurity
of
the
victims
her
zeal
for
faith
has
been
unduly
forgotten
yet
but
for
an
accident
she
might
have
covered
herself
with
the
glory
of
having
done
to
death
a
heretic
not
less
famous
than
giordano
bruno
the
poet
marlowe
was
accused
of
atheism
but
while
the
prosecution
was
hanging
over
him
he
was
killed
in
a
sordid
quarrel
in
a
tavern
another
dramatist
kyd
who
was
implicated
in
the
charge
was
put
to
the
torture
at
the
same
time
sir
walter
raleigh
was
prosecuted
for
unbelief
but
not
convicted
others
were
not
so
fortunate
three
or
four
persons
were
burned
at
norwich
in
the
reign
of
elizabeth
for
unchristian
doctrines
among
them
francis
kett
who
had
been
a
fellow
of
corpus
christi
cambridge
under
james
i
who
interested
himself
personally
in
such
matters
bartholomew
legate
was
charged
with
holding
various
pestilent
opinions
the
king
summoned
him
to
his
presence
and
asked
him
whether
he
did
not
pray
daily
to
jesus
christ
legate
replied
he
had
prayed
to
christ
in
the
days
of
his
ignorance
but
not
for
the
last
seven
years
base
fellow
said
james
spurning
him
with
his
foot
shall
never
be
said
that
one
stayeth
in
my
palace
that
hath
never
prayed
to
our
saviour
for
seven
years
legate
having
been
imprisoned
for
some
time
in
newgate
was
declared
an
incorrigible
heretic
and
burned
at
smithfield
just
a
month
later
one
wightman
was
burned
at
lichfield
by
the
bishop
of
coventry
for
heterodox
doctrines
it
is
possible
that
public
opinion
was
shocked
by
these
two
burnings
they
were
the
last
cases
in
england
of
death
for
unbelief
puritan
intolerance
indeed
passed
an
ordinance
in
by
which
all
who
denied
the
trinity
divinity
the
inspiration
of
scripture
or
a
future
state
were
liable
to
death
and
persons
guilty
of
other
heresies
to
imprisonment
but
this
did
not
lead
to
any
executions
the
renaissance
age
saw
the
first
signs
of
the
beginning
of
modern
science
but
the
mediaeval
prejudices
against
the
investigation
of
nature
were
not
dissipated
till
the
seventeenth
century
and
in
italy
they
continued
to
a
much
later
period
the
history
of
modern
astronomy
begins
in
with
the
publication
of
the
work
of
copernicus
revealing
the
truth
about
the
motions
of
the
earth
the
appearance
of
this
work
is
important
in
the
history
of
free
thought
because
it
raised
a
clear
and
definite
issue
between
science
and
scripture
and
osiander
who
edited
it
copernicus
was
dying
forseeing
the
outcry
it
would
raise
stated
untruly
in
the
preface
that
the
motion
was
put
forward
only
as
a
hypothesis
the
theory
was
denounced
by
catholics
and
reformers
and
it
did
not
convince
some
men
bacon
who
were
not
influenced
by
theological
prejudice
the
observations
of
the
italian
astronomer
galileo
galilei
demonstrated
the
copernican
theory
beyond
question
his
telescope
discovered
the
moons
of
jupiter
and
his
observation
of
the
spots
in
the
sun
confirmed
the
rotation
in
the
pulpits
of
florence
where
he
lived
under
the
protection
of
the
grand
duke
his
sensational
discoveries
were
condemned
of
galilee
why
stand
ye
gazing
up
into
heaven
he
was
then
denounced
to
the
holy
office
of
the
inquisition
by
two
dominican
monks
learning
that
his
investigations
were
being
considered
at
rome
galileo
went
thither
confident
that
he
would
be
able
to
convince
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
of
the
manifest
truth
of
copernicanism
he
did
not
realize
what
theology
was
capable
of
in
february
the
holy
office
decided
that
the
copernican
system
was
in
itself
absurd
and
in
respect
of
scripture
heretical
cardinal
bellarmin
by
the
direction
summoned
galileo
and
officially
admonished
him
to
abandon
his
opinion
and
cease
to
teach
it
otherwise
the
inquisition
would
proceed
against
him
galileo
promised
to
obey
the
book
of
copernicus
was
placed
on
the
index
it
has
been
remarked
that
book
on
solar
spots
contains
no
mention
of
scripture
and
thus
the
holy
office
in
its
decree
which
related
to
that
book
passed
judgment
on
a
scientific
not
a
theological
question
galileo
was
silenced
for
a
while
but
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
be
mute
for
ever
under
a
new
pope
urban
viii
he
looked
for
greater
liberty
and
there
were
many
in
the
papal
circle
who
were
well
disposed
to
him
he
hoped
to
avoid
difficulties
by
the
device
of
placing
the
arguments
for
the
old
and
the
new
theories
side
by
side
and
pretending
not
to
judge
between
them
he
wrote
a
treatise
on
the
two
systems
the
ptolemaic
and
the
copernican
in
the
form
of
dialogues
of
which
the
preface
declares
that
the
purpose
is
to
explain
the
pros
and
cons
of
the
two
views
but
the
spirit
of
the
work
is
copernican
he
received
permission
quite
definite
as
he
thought
from
father
riccardi
master
of
the
sacred
palace
to
print
it
and
it
appeared
in
the
pope
however
disapproved
of
it
the
book
was
examined
by
a
commission
and
galileo
was
summoned
before
the
inquisition
he
was
old
and
ill
and
the
humiliations
which
he
had
to
endure
are
a
painful
story
he
would
probably
have
been
more
severely
treated
if
one
of
the
members
of
the
tribunal
had
not
been
a
man
of
scientific
training
macolano
a
dominican
who
was
able
to
appreciate
his
ability
under
examination
galileo
denied
that
he
had
upheld
the
motion
of
the
earth
in
the
dialogues
and
asserted
that
he
had
shown
the
reasons
of
copernicus
to
be
inconclusive
this
defence
was
in
accordance
with
the
statement
in
his
preface
but
contradicted
his
deepest
conviction
in
struggling
with
such
a
tribunal
it
was
the
only
line
which
a
man
who
was
not
a
hero
could
take
at
a
later
session
he
forced
himself
ignominiously
to
confess
that
some
of
the
arguments
on
the
copernican
side
had
been
put
too
strongly
and
to
declare
himself
ready
to
confute
the
theory
in
the
final
examination
he
was
threatened
with
torture
he
said
that
before
the
decree
of
he
had
held
the
truth
of
the
copernican
system
to
be
arguable
but
since
then
he
had
held
the
ptolemaic
to
be
true
next
day
he
publicly
abjured
the
scientific
truth
which
he
had
demonstrated
he
was
allowed
to
retire
to
the
country
on
condition
that
he
saw
no
one
in
the
last
months
of
his
life
he
wrote
to
a
friend
to
this
effect
falsity
of
the
copernican
system
can
not
be
doubted
especially
by
us
catholics
it
is
refuted
by
the
irrefragable
authority
of
scripture
the
conjectures
of
copernicus
and
his
disciples
were
all
disposed
of
by
the
one
solid
argument
omnipotence
can
operate
in
infinitely
various
ways
if
something
appears
to
our
observation
to
happen
in
one
particular
way
we
must
not
curtail
arm
and
sustain
a
thing
in
which
we
may
be
the
irony
is
evident
rome
did
not
permit
the
truth
about
the
solar
system
to
be
taught
till
after
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
books
remained
on
the
index
till
the
prohibition
was
fatal
to
the
study
of
natural
science
in
italy
the
roman
index
reminds
us
of
the
significance
of
the
invention
of
printing
in
the
struggle
for
freedom
of
thought
by
making
it
easy
to
propagate
new
ideas
far
and
wide

speedily
realized
the
danger
and
took
measures
to
place
its
yoke
on
the
new
contrivance
which
promised
to
be
such
a
powerful
ally
of
reason

were
not
allowed
except
in

oxford
and

the
regulation
of
the
press
was
under
the
authority
of
the
star
chamber
nowhere
did
the
press
become
really
free
till
the
nineteenth
century
while
the
reformation
and
the
renovated
roman
church
meant
a
reaction
against
the
renaissance

vital
changes

a

the
cultivation
of

and
destined
to
lead
amid
the
competing
intolerances
of
catholic
and
protestant
powers
to
the
goal
of
liberty
we
shall
see
how
reason
and
the
growth
of
knowledge
undermined
the
bases
of
theological
authority
at
each
step
in
this
process
in
which
philosophical
speculation
historical
criticism
natural
science
have
all
taken

and

and

derived
from

substituted

interest
in
the
fortunes
of
the
human
race
upon
earth
for
the
interest
in
a
future
world
and
along
with
this
steady
intellectual
advance
toleration
gained
ground
and
freedom
won
more
champions
in
the
meantime
the
force
of
political
circumstances
was
compelling
governments
to
mitigate
their
maintenance
of
one
religious
creed
by
measures
of
relief
to
other
christian
sects
and
the
principle
of
exclusiveness
was
broken
down
for
reasons
of
worldly
expediency
religious
liberty
was
an
important
step
towards
complete
freedom
of
opinion
the
danger
however
was
felt
in
germany
and
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
study
of
scripture
was
not
encouraged
at

v
religious
toleration
in
the
third
century
the
indian
king
asoka
a
man
of
religious
zeal
but
of
tolerant
spirit
confronted
by
the
struggle
between
two
hostile
religions
brahmanism
and
buddhism
decided
that
both
should
be
equally
privileged
and
honoured
in
his
dominions
his
ordinances
on
the
matter
are
memorable
as
the
earliest
existing
edicts
of
toleration
in
europe
as
we
saw
the
principle
of
toleration
was
for
the
first
time
definitely
expressed
in
the
roman
imperial
edicts
which
terminated
the
persecution
of
the
christians
the
religious
strife
of
the
sixteenth
century
raised
the
question
in
its
modern
form
and
for
many
generations
it
was
one
of
the
chief
problems
of
statesmen
and
the
subject
of
endless
controversial
pamphlets
toleration
means
incomplete
religious
liberty
and
there
are
many
degrees
of
it
it
might
be
granted
to
certain
christian
sects
it
might
be
granted
to
christian
sects
but
these
alone
it
might
be
granted
to
all
religions
but
not
to
freethinkers
or
to
deists
but
not
to
atheists
it
might
mean
the
concession
of
some
civil
rights
but
not
of
others
it
might
mean
the
exclusion
of
those
who
are
tolerated
from
public
offices
or
from
certain
professions
the
religious
liberty
now
enjoyed
in
western
lands
has
been
gained
through
various
stages
of
toleration
we
owe
the
modern
principle
of
toleration
to
the
italian
group
of
reformers
who
rejected
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
and
were
the
fathers
of
unitarianism
the
reformation
movement
had
spread
to
italy
but
rome
was
successful
in
suppressing
it
and
many
heretics
fled
to
switzerland
the
group
were
forced
by
the
intolerance
of
calvin
to
flee
to
transylvania
and
poland
where
they
propagated
their
doctrines
the
unitarian
creed
was
moulded
by
fausto
sozzini
generally
known
as
socinus
and
in
the
catechism
of
his
sect
persecution
is
condemned
this
repudiation
of
the
use
of
force
in
the
interest
of
religion
is
a
consequence
of
the
socinian
doctrines
for
unlike
luther
and
calvin
the
socinians
conceded
such
a
wide
room
to
individual
judgment
in
the
interpretation
of
scripture
that
to
impose
socinianism
would
have
been
inconsistent
with
its
principles
in
other
words
there
was
a
strong
rationalistic
element
which
was
lacking
in
the
trinitarian
creeds
it
was
under
the
influence
of
the
socinian
spirit
that
castellion
of
savoy
sounded
the
trumpet
of
toleration
in
a
pamphlet
denouncing
the
burning
of
servetus
whereby
he
earned
the
malignant
hatred
of
calvin
he
maintained
the
innocence
of
error
and
ridiculed
the
importance
which
the
churches
laid
on
obscure
questions
such
as
predestination
and
the
trinity
discuss
the
difference
between
the
law
and
the
gospel
gratuitous
remission
of
sins
or
imputed
righteousness
is
as
if
a
man
were
to
discuss
whether
a
prince
was
to
come
on
horseback
or
in
a
chariot
or
dressed
in
white
or
in
religion
is
a
curse
if
persecution
is
a
necessary
part
of
it
for
a
long
time
the
socinians
and
those
who
came
under
their
influence
when
driven
from
poland
they
passed
into
germany
and
holland
were
the
only
sects
which
advocated
toleration
it
was
adopted
from
them
by
the
anabaptists
and
by
the
arminian
section
of
the
reformed
church
of
holland
and
in
holland
the
founder
of
the
english
congregationalists
who
under
the
name
of
independents
played
such
an
important
part
in
the
history
of
the
civil
war
and
the
commonwealth
learned
the
principle
of
liberty
of
conscience
socinus
thought
that
this
principle
could
be
realized
without
abolishing
the
state
church
he
contemplated
a
close
union
between
the
state
and
the
prevailing
church
combined
with
complete
toleration
for
other
sects
it
is
under
this
system
which
has
been
called
jurisdictional
that
religious
liberty
has
been
realized
in
european
states
but
there
is
another
and
simpler
method
that
of
separating
church
from
state
and
placing
all
religions
on
an
equality
this
was
the
solution
which
the
anabaptists
would
have
preferred
they
detested
the
state
and
the
doctrine
of
religious
liberty
was
not
precious
to
them
their
ideal
system
would
have
been
an
anabaptist
theocracy
separation
was
the
second
best
in
europe
public
opinion
was
not
ripe
for
separation
inasmuch
as
the
most
powerful
religious
bodies
were
alike
in
regarding
toleration
as
wicked
indifference
but
it
was
introduced
in
a
small
corner
of
the
new
world
beyond
the
atlantic
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
puritans
who
fled
from
the
intolerance
of
the
english
church
and
state
and
founded
colonies
in
new
england
were
themselves
equally
intolerant
not
only
to
anglicans
and
catholics
but
to
baptists
and
quakers
they
set
up
theocratical
governments
from
which
all
who
did
not
belong
to
their
own
sect
were
excluded
roger
williams
had
imbibed
from
the
dutch
arminians
the
idea
of
separation
of
church
from
state
on
account
of
this
heresy
he
was
driven
from
massachusetts
and
he
founded
providence
to
be
a
refuge
for
those
whom
the
puritan
colonists
persecuted
here
he
set
up
a
democratic
constitution
in
which
the
magistrates
had
power
only
in
civil
matters
and
could
not
interfere
with
religion
other
towns
were
presently
founded
in
rhode
island
and
a
charter
of
charles
ii
confirmed
the
constitution
which
secured
to
all
citizens
professing
christianity
of
whatever
form
the
full
enjoyment
of
political
rights
were
tolerated
but
were
not
admitted
to
the
political
rights
of
christians
so
far
the
new
state
fell
short
of
perfect
liberty
but
the
fact
that
jews
were
soon
admitted
notwithstanding
to
full
citizenship
shows
how
free
the
atmosphere
was
to
roger
williams
belongs
the
glory
of
having
founded
the
first
modern
state
which
was
really
tolerant
and
was
based
on
the
principle
of
taking
the
control
of
religious
matters
entirely
out
of
the
hands
of
the
civil
government
toleration
was
also
established
in
the
roman
catholic
colony
of
maryland
but
in
a
different
way
through
the
influence
of
lord
baltimore
an
act
of
toleration
was
passed
in
notable
as
the
first
decree
voted
by
a
legal
assembly
granting
complete
freedom
to
all
christians
no
one
professing
faith
in
christ
was
to
be
molested
in
regard
to
his
religion
but
the
law
was
heavy
on
all
outside
this
pale
any
one
who
blasphemed
god
or
attacked
the
trinity
or
any
member
of
the
trinity
was
threatened
by
the
penalty
of
death
the
tolerance
of
maryland
attracted
so
many
protestant
settlers
from
virginia
that
the
protestants
became
a
majority
and
as
soon
as
they
won
political
preponderance
they
introduced
an
act
excluding
papists
and
prelatists
from
toleration
the
rule
of
the
baltimores
was
restored
after
and
the
old
religious
freedom
was
revived
but
with
the
accession
of
william
iii
the
protestants
again
came
into
power
and
the
toleration
which
the
catholics
had
instituted
in
maryland
came
to
an
end
it
will
be
observed
that
in
both
these
cases
freedom
was
incomplete
but
it
was
much
larger
and
more
fundamental
in
rhode
island
where
it
had
been
ultimately
derived
from
the
doctrine
of
socinus
when
the
colonies
became
independent
of
england
the
federal
constitution
which
they
set
up
was
absolutely
secular
but
it
was
left
to
each
member
of
the
union
to
adopt
separation
or
not
if
separation
has
become
the
rule
in
the
american
states
it
may
be
largely
due
to
the
fact
that
on
any
other
system
the
governments
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
impose
mutual
tolerance
on
the
sects
it
must
be
added
that
in
maryland
and
a
few
southern
states
atheists
still
suffer
from
some
political
disabilities
in
england
the
experiment
of
separation
would
have
been
tried
under
the
commonwealth
if
the
independents
had
had
their
way
this
policy
was
overruled
by
cromwell
the
new
national
church
included
presbyterians
independents
and
baptists
but
liberty
of
worship
was
granted
to
all
christian
sects
except
roman
catholics
and
anglicans
if
the
parliament
had
had
the
power
this
toleration
would
have
been
a
mere
name
the
presbyterians
regarded
toleration
as
a
work
of
the
devil
and
would
have
persecuted
the
independents
if
they
could
but
under
autocratic
rule
even
the
anglicans
lived
in
peace
and
toleration
was
extended
to
the
jews
in
these
days
voices
were
raised
from
various
quarters
advocating
toleration
on
general
grounds
the
most
illustrious
advocate
was
milton
the
poet
who
was
in
favour
of
the
severance
of
church
from
state
in
areopagitica
a
speech
for
the
liberty
of
unlicensed
printing
the
freedom
of
the
press
is
eloquently
sustained
by
arguments
which
are
valid
for
freedom
of
thought
in
general
it
is
shown
that
the
censorship
will
conduce
the
discouragement
of
all
learning
and
the
stop
of
truth
not
only
by
disexercising
and
blunting
our
abilities
in
what
we
know
already
but
by
hindering
and
cropping
the
discovery
that
might
be
yet
further
made
both
in
religious
and
civil
for
knowledge
is
advanced
through
the
utterance
of
new
opinions
and
truth
is
discovered
by
free
discussion
if
the
waters
of
truth
not
in
a
perpetual
progression
they
sicken
into
a
muddy
pool
of
conformity
and
books
which
are
authorized
by
the
licensers
are
apt
to
be
as
bacon
said
the
language
of
the
times
and
do
not
contribute
to
progress
the
examples
of
the
countries
where
the
censorship
is
severe
do
not
suggest
that
it
is
useful
for
morals
into
italy
and
spain
whether
those
places
be
one
scruple
the
better
the
honester
the
wiser
the
chaster
since
all
the
inquisitional
rigour
that
hath
been
executed
upon
spain
indeed
could
reply
are
what
is
more
important
more
it
is
interesting
to
notice
that
milton
places
freedom
of
thought
above
civil
liberty
me
the
liberty
to
know
to
utter
and
to
argue
freely
according
to
conscience
above
all
other
with
the
restoration
of
the
monarchy
and
the
anglican
church
religious
liberty
was
extinguished
by
a
series
of
laws
against
dissenters
to
the
revolution
we
owe
the
act
of
toleration
from
which
the
religious
freedom
which
england
enjoys
at
present
is
derived
it
granted
freedom
of
worship
to
presbyterians
congregationalists
baptists
and
quakers
but
only
to
these
catholics
and
unitarians
were
expressly
excepted
and
the
repressive
legislation
of
charles
ii
remained
in
force
against
them
it
was
a
characteristically
english
measure
logically
inconsistent
and
absurd
a
mixture
of
tolerance
and
intolerance
but
suitable
to
the
circumstances
and
the
state
of
public
opinion
at
the
time
in
the
same
year
john
famous
first
letter
concerning
toleration
appeared
in
latin
three
subsequent
letters
developed
and
illustrated
his
thesis
the
main
argument
is
based
on
the
principle
that
the
business
of
civil
government
is
quite
distinct
from
that
of
religion
that
the
state
is
a
society
constituted
only
for
preserving
and
promoting
the
civil
interests
of
its
members
interests
meaning
life
liberty
health
and
the
possession
of
property
the
care
of
souls
is
not
committed
to
magistrates
more
than
to
other
men
for
the
magistrate
can
only
use
outward
force
but
true
religion
means
the
inward
persuasion
of
the
mind
and
the
mind
is
so
made
that
force
can
not
compel
it
to
believe
so
too
it
is
absurd
for
a
state
to
make
laws
to
enforce
a
religion
for
laws
are
useless
without
penalties
and
penalties
are
impertinent
because
they
can
not
convince
moreover
even
if
penalties
could
change
beliefs
this
would
not
conduce
to
the
salvation
of
souls
would
more
men
be
saved
if
all
blindly
resigned
themselves
to
the
will
of
their
rulers
and
accepted
the
religion
of
their
country
for
as
the
princes
of
the
world
are
divided
in
religion
one
country
alone
would
be
in
the
right
and
all
the
rest
of
the
world
would
have
to
follow
their
princes
to
destruction
that
which
heightens
the
absurdity
and
very
ill
suits
the
notion
of
a
deity
men
would
owe
their
eternal
happiness
or
their
eternal
misery
to
the
places
of
their
this
is
a
principle
on
which
locke
repeatedly
insists
if
a
state
is
justified
in
imposing
a
creed
it
follows
that
in
all
the
lands
except
the
one
or
few
in
which
the
true
faith
prevails
it
is
the
duty
of
the
subjects
to
embrace
a
false
religion
if
protestantism
is
promoted
in
england
popery
by
the
same
rule
will
be
promoted
in
france
is
true
and
good
in
england
will
be
true
and
good
at
rome
too
in
china
or
toleration
is
the
principle
which
gives
to
the
true
faith
the
best
chance
of
prevailing
locke
would
concede
full
liberty
to
idolaters
by
whom
he
means
the
indians
of
north
america
and
he
makes
some
scathing
remarks
on
the
ecclesiastical
zeal
which
forced
these
to
forsake
their
ancient
religion
but
his
toleration
though
it
extends
beyond
the
christian
pale
is
not
complete
he
excepts
in
the
first
place
roman
catholics
not
on
account
of
their
theological
dogmas
but
because
they
that
faith
is
not
to
be
kept
with
heretics
that
excommunicated
forfeit
their
crowns
and
kingdoms
and
because
they
deliver
themselves
up
to
the
protection
and
service
of
a
foreign
pope
in
other
words
they
are
politically
dangerous
his
other
exception
is
atheists
are
not
all
to
be
tolerated
who
deny
the
being
of
god
promises
covenants
and
oaths
which
are
the
bonds
of
human
society
can
have
no
hold
upon
an
atheist
the
taking
away
of
god
though
but
even
in
thought
dissolves
all
besides
also
those
that
by
their
atheism
undermine
and
destroy
all
religion
can
have
no
pretence
of
religion
to
challenge
the
privilege
of
a
thus
locke
is
not
free
from
the
prejudices
of
his
time
these
exceptions
contradict
his
own
principle
that
is
absurd
that
things
should
be
enjoined
by
laws
which
are
not
in
power
to
perform
and
to
believe
this
or
that
to
be
true
does
not
depend
upon
our
this
applies
to
roman
catholics
as
to
protestants
to
atheists
as
to
deists
locke
however
perhaps
thought
that
the
speculative
opinion
of
atheism
which
was
uncommon
in
his
day
does
depend
on
the
will
he
would
have
excluded
from
his
state
his
great
contemporary
spinoza
but
in
spite
of
its
limitations
toleration
is
a
work
of
the
highest
value
and
its
argument
takes
us
further
than
its
author
went
it
asserts
unrestrictedly
the
secular
principle
and
its
logical
issue
is
disestablishment
a
church
is
merely
free
and
voluntary
i
may
notice
the
remark
that
if
infidels
were
to
be
converted
by
force
it
was
easier
for
god
to
do
it
armies
of
heavenly
legions
than
for
any
son
of
the
church
how
potent
soever
with
all
his
this
is
a
polite
way
of
stating
a
maxim
analogous
to
that
of
the
emperor
tiberius
above
if
false
beliefs
are
an
offence
to
god
it
is
really
his
affair
the
toleration
of
nonconformists
was
far
from
pleasing
extreme
anglicans
and
the
influence
of
this
party
at
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
menaced
the
liberty
of
dissenters
the
situation
provoked
defoe
who
was
a
zealous
nonconformist
to
write
his
pamphlet
the
shortest
way
with
the
dissenters
an
ironical
attack
upon
the
principle
of
toleration
it
pretends
to
show
that
the
dissenters
are
at
heart
incorrigible
rebels
that
a
gentle
policy
is
useless
and
suggests
that
all
preachers
at
conventicles
should
be
hanged
and
all
persons
found
attending
such
meetings
should
be
banished
this
exceedingly
amusing
but
terribly
earnest
caricature
of
the
sentiments
of
the
high
anglican
party
at
first
deceived
and
alarmed
the
dissenters
themselves
but
the
high
churchmen
were
furious
defoe
was
fined
exposed
in
the
pillory
three
times
and
sent
to
newgate
prison
but
the
tory
reaction
was
only
temporary
during
the
eighteenth
century
a
relatively
tolerant
spirit
prevailed
among
the
christian
sects
and
new
sects
were
founded
the
official
church
became
less
fanatical
many
of
its
leading
divines
were
influenced
by
rationalistic
thought
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
opposition
of
king
george
iii
the
catholics
might
have
been
freed
from
their
disabilities
before
the
end
of
the
century
this
measure
eloquently
advocated
by
burke
and
desired
by
pitt
was
not
carried
till
and
then
under
the
threat
of
a
revolution
in
ireland
in
the
meantime
legal
toleration
had
been
extended
to
the
unitarians
in
but
they
were
not
relieved
from
all
disabilities
till
the
forties
jews
were
not
admitted
to
the
full
rights
of
citizenship
till
the
achievement
of
religious
liberty
in
england
in
the
nineteenth
century
has
been
mainly
the
work
of
liberals
the
liberal
party
has
been
moving
towards
the
ultimate
goal
of
complete
secularization
and
the
separation
of
the
church
from
the
the
logical
results
of
theory
of
civil
government
the
disestablishment
of
the
church
in
ireland
in
partly
realized
this
ideal
and
now
more
than
forty
years
later
the
liberal
party
is
seeking
to
apply
the
principle
to
wales
it
is
highly
characteristic
of
english
politics
and
english
psychology
that
the
change
should
be
carried
out
in
this
piecemeal
fashion
in
the
other
countries
of
the
british
empire
the
system
of
separation
prevails
there
is
no
connection
between
the
state
and
any
sect
no
church
is
anything
more
than
a
voluntary
society
but
secularization
has
advanced
under
the
state
church
system
it
is
enough
to
mention
the
education
act
of
and
the
abolition
of
religious
tests
at
universities
other
gains
for
freedom
will
be
noticed
when
i
come
to
speak
in
another
chapter
of
the
progress
of
rationalism
if
we
compare
the
religious
situation
in
france
in
the
seventeenth
with
that
in
the
eighteenth
century
it
seems
to
be
sharply
contrasted
with
the
development
in
england
in
england
there
was
a
great
advance
towards
religious
liberty
in
france
there
was
a
falling
away
until
the
french
protestants
huguenots
were
tolerated
for
the
next
hundred
years
they
were
outlaws
but
the
toleration
which
their
charter
the
edict
of
nantes
secured
them
was
of
a
limited
kind
they
were
excluded
for
instance
from
the
army
they
were
excluded
from
paris
and
other
cities
and
districts
and
the
liberty
which
they
enjoyed
was
confined
to
them
it
was
not
granted
to
any
other
sect
the
charter
was
faithfully
maintained
by
the
two
great
cardinals
richelieu
and
mazarin
who
governed
france
under
louis
xiii
and
louis
xiv
but
when
the
latter
assumed
the
active
power
in
he
began
a
series
of
laws
against
the
protestants
which
culminated
in
the
revoking
of
the
charter
and
the
beginning
of
a
protestant
persecution
the
french
clergy
justified
this
policy
by
the
notorious
text
them
to
come
in
and
appealed
to
augustine
their
arguments
evoked
a
defence
of
toleration
by
bayle
a
french
protestant
who
had
taken
refuge
in
holland
it
was
entitled
a
philosophical
commentary
on
the
text
them
to
come
and
in
importance
stands
beside
work
which
was
being
composed
at
the
same
time
many
of
the
arguments
urged
by
the
two
writers
are
identical
they
agreed
and
for
the
same
reasons
in
excluding
roman
catholics
the
most
characteristic
thing
in
treatise
is
his
sceptical
argument
that
even
if
it
were
a
right
principle
to
suppress
error
by
force
no
truth
is
certain
enough
to
justify
us
in
applying
the
theory
we
shall
see
next
chapter
this
eminent
contribution
to
rationalism
though
there
was
an
immense
exodus
of
protestants
from
france
louis
did
not
succeed
in
his
design
of
extirpating
heresy
from
his
lands
in
the
eighteenth
century
under
louis
xv
the
presence
of
protestants
was
tolerated
though
they
were
outlaws
their
marriages
were
not
recognized
as
legal
and
they
were
liable
at
any
moment
to
persecution
about
the
middle
of
the
century
a
literary
agitation
began
conducted
mainly
by
rationalists
but
finally
supported
by
enlightened
catholics
to
relieve
the
affliction
of
the
oppressed
sect
it
resulted
at
last
in
an
edict
of
toleration
which
made
the
position
of
the
protestants
endurable
though
it
excluded
them
from
certain
careers
the
most
energetic
and
forceful
leader
in
the
campaign
against
intolerance
was
voltaire
see
next
chapter
and
his
exposure
of
some
glaring
cases
of
unjust
persecution
did
more
than
general
arguments
to
achieve
the
object
the
most
infamous
case
was
that
of
jean
calas
a
protestant
merchant
of
toulouse
whose
son
committed
suicide
a
report
was
set
abroad
that
the
young
man
had
decided
to
join
the
catholic
church
and
that
his
father
mother
and
brother
filled
with
protestant
bigotry
killed
him
with
the
help
of
a
friend
they
were
all
put
in
irons
tried
and
condemned
though
there
were
no
arguments
for
their
guilt
except
the
conjecture
of
bigotry
jean
calas
was
broken
on
the
wheel
his
son
and
daughter
cast
into
convents
his
wife
left
to
starve
through
the
activity
of
voltaire
then
living
near
geneva
the
widow
was
induced
to
go
to
paris
where
she
was
kindly
received
and
assisted
by
eminent
lawyers
a
judicial
inquiry
was
made
the
toulouse
sentence
was
reversed
and
the
king
granted
pensions
to
those
who
had
suffered
this
scandal
could
only
have
happened
in
the
provinces
according
to
voltaire
paris
he
says
powerful
though
it
may
be
is
always
controlled
by
the
case
of
sirven
though
it
did
not
end
tragically
was
similar
and
the
government
of
toulouse
was
again
responsible
he
was
accused
of
having
drowned
his
daughter
in
a
well
to
hinder
her
from
becoming
a
catholic
and
was
with
his
wife
sentenced
to
death
fortunately
he
and
his
family
had
escaped
to
switzerland
where
they
persuaded
voltaire
of
their
innocence
to
get
the
sentence
reversed
was
the
work
of
nine
years
and
this
time
it
was
reversed
at
toulouse
when
voltaire
visited
paris
in
he
was
acclaimed
by
crowds
as
the
of
calas
and
the
his
disinterested
practical
activity
against
persecution
was
of
far
more
value
than
the
treatise
on
toleration
which
he
wrote
in
connexion
with
the
calas
episode
it
is
a
poor
work
compared
with
those
of
locke
and
bayle
the
tolerance
which
he
advocates
is
of
a
limited
kind
he
would
confine
public
offices
and
dignities
to
those
who
belong
to
the
state
religion
but
if
system
of
toleration
is
limited
it
is
wide
compared
with
the
religious
establishment
advocated
by
his
contemporary
rousseau
though
of
swiss
birth
rousseau
belongs
to
the
literature
and
history
of
france
but
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
he
was
brought
up
in
the
traditions
of
calvinistic
geneva
his
ideal
state
would
in
its
way
have
been
little
better
than
any
theocracy
he
proposed
to
establish
a
which
was
to
be
a
sort
of
undogmatic
christianity
but
certain
dogmas
which
he
considered
essential
were
to
be
imposed
on
all
citizens
on
pain
of
banishment
such
were
the
existence
of
a
deity
the
future
bliss
of
the
good
and
punishment
of
the
bad
the
duty
of
tolerance
towards
all
those
who
accepted
the
fundamental
articles
of
faith
it
may
be
said
that
a
state
founded
on
this
basis
would
be
fairly
all
christian
sects
and
many
deists
could
find
a
place
in
it
but
by
imposing
indispensable
beliefs
it
denies
the
principle
of
toleration
the
importance
of
idea
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
inspired
one
of
the
experiments
in
religious
policy
which
were
made
during
the
french
revolution
the
revolution
established
religious
liberty
in
france
most
of
the
leaders
were
unorthodox
their
rationalism
was
naturally
of
the
type
and
in
the
preamble
to
the
declaration
of
rights
deism
was
asserted
by
the
words
the
presence
and
under
the
auspices
of
the
supreme
against
which
only
one
voice
protested
the
declaration
laid
down
that
no
one
was
to
be
vexed
on
account
of
his
religious
opinions
provided
he
did
not
thereby
trouble
public
order
catholicism
was
retained
as
the
religion
protestants
but
not
jews
were
admitted
to
public
office
mirabeau
the
greatest
statesman
of
the
day
protested
strongly
against
the
use
of
words
like
and
he
said
most
unlimited
liberty
of
religion
is
in
my
eyes
a
right
so
sacred
that
to
express
it
by
the
word
seems
to
me
itself
a
sort
of
tyranny
since
the
authority
which
tolerates
might
also
not
the
same
protest
was
made
in
thomas
rights
of
man
which
appeared
two
years
later
is
not
the
opposite
of
intolerance
but
is
the
counterfeit
of
it
both
are
despotisms
the
one
assumes
itself
the
right
of
withholding
liberty
of
conscience
and
the
other
of
granting
paine
was
an
ardent
deist
and
he
added
a
bill
brought
into
any
parliament
entitled
act
to
tolerate
or
grant
liberty
to
the
almighty
to
receive
the
worship
of
a
jew
or
a
turk
or
prohibit
the
almighty
from
receiving
it
all
men
would
startle
and
call
it
blasphemy
there
would
be
an
uproar
the
presumption
of
toleration
in
religious
matters
would
then
present
itself
the
revolution
began
well
but
the
spirit
of
mirabeau
was
not
in
the
ascendant
throughout
its
course
the
vicissitudes
in
religious
policy
from
to
have
a
particular
interest
because
they
show
that
the
principle
of
liberty
of
conscience
was
far
from
possessing
the
minds
of
the
men
who
were
proud
of
abolishing
the
intolerance
of
the
government
which
they
had
overthrown
the
state
church
was
reorganized
by
the
civil
constitution
of
the
clergy
by
which
french
citizens
were
forbidden
to
acknowledge
the
authority
of
the
pope
and
the
appointment
of
bishops
was
transferred
to
the
electors
of
the
departments
so
that
the
commanding
influence
passed
from
the
crown
to
the
nation
doctrine
and
worship
were
not
touched
under
the
democratic
republic
which
succeeded
the
fall
of
the
monarchy
this
constitution
was
maintained
but
a
movement
to
dechristianize
france
was
inaugurated
and
the
commune
of
paris
ordered
the
churches
of
all
religions
to
be
closed
the
worship
of
reason
with
rites
modelled
on
the
catholic
was
organized
in
paris
and
the
provinces
the
government
violently
did
not
care
to
use
force
against
the
prevalent
faith
direct
persecution
would
have
weakened
the
national
defence
and
scandalized
europe
they
naïvely
hoped
that
the
superstition
would
disappear
by
degrees
robespierre
declared
against
the
policy
of
unchristianizing
france
and
when
he
had
the
power
april
he
established
as
a
state
religion
the
worship
of
the
supreme
being
french
people
recognizes
the
existence
of
the
supreme
being
and
the
immortality
of
the
the
liberty
of
other
cults
was
maintained
thus
for
a
few
months
idea
was
more
or
less
realized
it
meant
intolerance
atheism
was
regarded
as
a
vice
and
were
atheists
who
did
not
think
like
the
democratic
was
succeeded
by
the
republic
and
the
policy
of
its
government
was
to
hinder
the
preponderance
of
any
one
religious
group
to
hold
the
balance
among
all
the
creeds
but
with
a
certain
partiality
against
the
strongest
the
catholic
which
threatened
as
was
thought
to
destroy
the
others
or
even
the
republic
the
plan
was
to
favour
the
growth
of
new
rationalistic
cults
and
to
undermine
revealed
religion
by
a
secular
system
of
education
accordingly
the
church
was
separated
from
the
state
by
the
constitution
of
which
affirmed
the
liberty
of
all
worship
and
withdrew
from
the
catholic
clergy
the
salaries
which
the
state
had
hitherto
paid
the
elementary
schools
were
laicized
the
declaration
of
rights
the
articles
of
the
constitution
and
republican
morality
were
taught
instead
of
religion
an
enthusiast
declared
that
religion
of
socrates
marcus
aurelius
and
cicero
would
soon
be
the
religion
of
the
a
new
rationalistic
religion
was
introduced
under
the
name
of
theophilanthropy
it
was
the
of
the
philosophers
and
poets
of
the
century
of
voltaire
and
the
english
the
purified
christianity
of
rousseau
but
anterior
and
superior
to
christianity
its
doctrines
briefly
formulated
were
god
immortality
fraternity
humanity
no
attacks
on
other
religions
but
respect
and
honour
towards
all
gatherings
in
a
family
or
in
a
temple
to
encourage
one
another
to
practise
morality
protected
by
the
government
sometimes
secretly
sometimes
openly
it
had
a
certain
success
among
the
cultivated
classes
the
idea
of
the
lay
state
was
popularized
under
this
rule
and
by
the
end
of
the
century
there
was
virtually
religious
peace
in
france
under
the
consulate
from
the
same
system
continued
but
napoleon
ceased
to
protect
theophilanthropy
in
though
there
seems
to
have
been
little
discontent
with
the
existing
arrangement
napoleon
decided
to
upset
it
and
bring
the
pope
upon
the
scene
the
catholic
religion
as
that
of
the
majority
was
again
taken
under
the
special
protection
of
the
state
the
salaries
of
the
clergy
again
paid
by
the
nation
and
the
papal
authority
over
the
church
again
recognized
within
limits
while
full
toleration
of
other
religions
was
maintained
this
was
the
effect
of
the
concordat
between
the
french
republic
and
the
pope
it
is
the
judgment
of
a
high
authority
that
the
nation
if
it
had
been
consulted
would
have
pronounced
against
the
change
it
may
be
doubted
whether
this
is
true
but
policy
seems
to
have
been
prompted
by
the
calculation
that
using
the
pope
as
an
instrument
he
could
control
the
consciences
of
men
and
more
easily
carry
out
his
plans
of
empire
apart
from
its
ecclesiastical
policies
and
its
experiments
in
new
creeds
based
on
the
principles
of
rationalistic
thinkers
the
french
revolution
itself
has
an
interest
in
connexion
with
our
subject
as
an
example
of
the
coercion
of
reason
by
an
intolerant
faith
the
leaders
believed
that
by
applying
certain
principles
they
could
regenerate
france
and
show
the
world
how
the
lasting
happiness
of
mankind
can
be
secured
they
acted
in
the
name
of
reason
but
their
principles
were
articles
of
faith
which
were
accepted
just
as
blindly
and
irrationally
as
the
dogmas
of
any
supernatural
creed
one
of
these
dogmas
was
the
false
doctrine
of
rousseau
that
man
is
a
being
who
is
naturally
good
and
loves
justice
and
order
another
was
the
illusion
that
all
men
are
equal
by
nature
the
puerile
conviction
prevailed
that
legislation
could
completely
blot
out
the
past
and
radically
transform
the
character
of
a
society
equality
and
was
as
much
a
creed
as
the
creed
of
the
apostles
it
hypnotized
minds
like
a
revelation
from
on
high
and
reason
had
as
little
part
in
its
propagation
as
in
the
spread
of
christianity
or
of
protestantism
it
meant
anything
but
equality
fraternity
or
liberty
especially
liberty
when
it
was
translated
into
action
by
the
fanatical
apostles
of
who
were
blind
to
the
facts
of
human
nature
and
defied
the
facts
of
econnomics
terror
the
usual
instrument
in
propagating
religions
was
never
more
mercilessly
applied
any
one
who
questioned
the
doctrines
was
a
heretic
and
deserved
a
fate
and
as
in
most
religious
movements
the
milder
and
less
unreasonable
spirits
succumbed
to
the
fanatics
never
was
the
name
of
reason
more
grievously
abused
than
by
those
who
believed
they
were
inaugurating
her
reign
religious
liberty
however
among
other
good
things
did
emerge
from
the
revolution
at
first
in
the
form
of
separation
and
then
under
the
concordat
the
concordat
lasted
for
more
than
a
century
under
monarchies
and
republics
till
it
was
abolished
in
december
when
the
system
of
separation
was
introduced
again
in
the
german
states
the
history
of
religious
liberty
differs
in
many
ways
but
it
resembles
the
development
in
france
in
so
far
as
toleration
in
a
limited
form
was
at
first
brought
about
by
war
the
thirty
war
which
divided
germany
in
the
first
half
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
in
which
as
in
the
english
civil
war
religion
and
politics
were
mixed
was
terminated
by
the
peace
of
westphalia
by
this
act
three
religions
the
catholic
the
lutheran
and
the
reformed
were
legally
recognized
by
the
holy
roman
empire
and
placed
on
an
equality
all
other
religious
were
excluded
but
it
was
left
to
each
of
the
german
states
of
which
the
empire
consisted
to
tolerate
or
not
any
religion
it
pleased
that
is
every
prince
could
impose
on
his
subjects
whichever
of
the
three
religions
he
chose
and
refuse
to
tolerate
the
others
in
his
territory
but
he
might
also
admit
one
or
both
of
the
others
and
he
might
allow
the
followers
of
other
creeds
to
reside
in
his
dominion
and
practise
their
religion
within
the
precincts
of
their
own
houses
thus
toleration
varied
from
state
to
state
according
to
the
policy
of
each
particular
prince
as
elsewhere
so
in
germany
considerations
of
political
expediency
promoted
the
growth
of
toleration
especially
in
prussia
and
as
elsewhere
theoretical
advocates
exercised
great
influence
on
public
opinion
but
the
case
for
toleration
was
based
by
its
german
defenders
chiefly
on
legal
not
as
in
england
and
france
on
moral
and
intellectual
grounds
they
regarded
it
as
a
question
of
law
and
discussed
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
legal
relations
between
state
and
church
it
had
been
considered
long
ago
from
this
standpoint
by
an
original
italian
thinker
marsilius
of
padua
thirteenth
century
who
had
maintained
that
the
church
had
no
power
to
employ
physical
coercion
and
that
if
the
lay
authority
punished
heretics
the
punishment
was
inflicted
for
the
violation
not
of
divine
ordinances
but
of
the
law
of
the
state
which
excluded
heretics
from
its
territory
christian
thomasius
may
be
taken
as
a
leading
exponent
of
the
theory
that
religious
liberty
logically
follows
from
a
right
conception
of
law
he
laid
down
in
a
series
of
pamphlets
that
the
prince
who
alone
has
the
power
of
coercion
has
no
right
to
interfere
in
spiritual
matters
while
the
clergy
step
beyond
their
province
if
they
interfere
in
secular
matters
or
defend
their
faith
by
any
other
means
than
teaching
but
the
secular
power
has
no
legal
right
to
coerce
heretics
unless
heresy
is
a
crime
and
heresy
is
not
a
crime
but
an
error
for
it
is
not
a
matter
of
will
thomasius
moreover
urges
the
view
that
the
public
welfare
has
nothing
to
gain
from
unity
of
faith
that
it
makes
no
difference
what
faith
a
man
professes
so
long
as
he
is
loyal
to
the
state
his
toleration
indeed
is
not
complete
he
was
much
influenced
by
the
writings
of
his
contemporary
locke
and
he
excepts
from
the
benefit
of
toleration
the
same
classes
which
locke
excepted
besides
the
influence
of
the
jurists
we
may
note
that
the
pietistic
reaction
of
religious
enthusiasm
against
the
formal
theology
of
the
lutheran
animated
by
a
spirit
favourable
to
toleration
and
that
the
cause
was
promoted
by
the
leading
men
of
letters
especially
by
lessing
in
the
second
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
but
perhaps
the
most
important
fact
of
all
in
hastening
the
realization
of
religious
liberty
in
germany
was
the
accession
of
a
rationalist
to
the
throne
of
prussia
in
the
person
of
frederick
the
great
a
few
months
after
his
accession
he
wrote
in
the
margin
of
a
state
paper
in
which
a
question
of
religious
policy
occurred
that
every
one
should
be
allowed
to
get
to
heaven
in
his
own
way
his
view
that
morality
was
independent
of
religion
and
therefore
compatible
with
all
religions
and
that
thus
a
man
could
be
a
good
only
thing
which
the
state
was
entitled
to
faith
he
might
profess
led
to
the
logical
consequence
of
complete
religious
liberty
catholics
were
placed
on
an
equality
with
protestants
and
the
treaty
of
westphalia
was
violated
by
the
extension
of
full
toleration
to
all
the
forbidden
sects
frederick
even
conceived
the
idea
of
introducing
mohammedan
settlers
into
some
parts
of
his
realm
contrast
england
under
george
iii
france
under
louis
xv
italy
under
the
shadow
of
the
popes
it
is
an
important
fact
in
history
which
has
hardly
been
duly
emphasized
that
full
religious
liberty
was
for
the
first
time
in
any
country
in
modern
europe
realized
under
a
ruler
the
friend
of
the
great
voltaire
the
policy
and
principles
of
frederick
were
formulated
in
the
prussian
territorial
code
of
by
which
unrestricted
liberty
of
conscience
was
guaranteed
and
the
three
chief
religions
the
lutheran
the
reformed
and
the
catholic
were
placed
on
the
same
footing
and
enjoyed
the
same
privileges
the
system
is
only
three
churches
here
occupy
the
position
which
the
anglican
church
alone
occupies
in
england
the
rest
of
germany
did
not
begin
to
move
in
the
direction
pointed
out
by
prussia
until
by
one
of
the

acts
of

roman
empire
the
westphalian
settlement
had
been
modified
before
the
foundation
of
the
new
empire
freedom
was
established
throughout
germany
in
austria
the
emperor
joseph
ii
issued
an
edict
of
toleration
in
which
may
be
considered
a
broad
measure
for
a
catholic
state
at
that
time
joseph
was
a
sincere
catholic
but
he
was
not
impervious
to
the
enlightened
ideas
of
his
age
he
was
an
admirer
of
frederick
and
his
edict
was
prompted
by
a
genuinely
tolerant
spirit
such
as
had
not
inspired
the
english
act
of
it
extended
only
to
the
lutheran
and
reformed
sects
and
the
communities
of
the
greek
church
which
had
entered
into
union
with
rome
and
it
was
of
a
limited
kind
religious
liberty
was
not
established
till
the
measure
of
joseph
applied
to
the
austrian
states
in
italy
and
helped
to
prepare
that
country
for
the
idea
of
religious
freedom
it
is
notable
that
in
italy
in
the
eighteenth
century
toleration
found
its
advocate
not
in
a
rationalist
or
a
philosopher
but
in
a
catholic
ecclesiastic
tamburinni
who
under
the
name
of
his
friend
trautmansdorf
published
a
work
on
ecclesiastical
and
civil
toleration
a
sharp
line
is
drawn
between
the
provinces
of
the
church
and
the
state
persecution
and
the
inquisition
are
condemned
coercion
of
conscience
is
declared
inconsistent
with
the
christian
spirit
and
the
principle
is
laid
down
that
the
sovran
should
only
exercise
coercion
where
the
interests
of
public
safety
are
concerned
like
locke
the
author
thinks
that
atheism
is
a
legitimate
case
for
such
coercion
the
new
states
which
napoleon
set
up
in
italy
exhibited
toleration
in
various
degrees
but
real
liberty
was
first
introduced
in
piedmont
by
cavour
a
measure
which
prepared
the
way
for
the
full
liberty
which
was
one
of
the
of
the
foundation
of
the
italian
kingdom
in
the
union
of
italy
with
all
that
it
meant
is
the
most
signal
and
dramatic
act
in
the
triumph
of
the
ideas
of
the
modern
state
over
the
traditional
principles
of
the
christian
church
rome
which
preserved
those
principles
most
faithfully
has
offered
a
steadfast
we
may
say
a
heroic
resistance
to
the
liberal
ideas
which
swept
europe
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
guides
of
her
policy
grasped
thoroughly
the
danger
which
liberal
thought
meant
for
an
institution
which
founded
in
a
remote
past
claimed
to
be
unchangeable
and
never
out
of
date
gregory
xvi
issued
a
solemn
protest
maintaining
authority
against
freedom
the
mediaeval
against
the
modern
ideal
in
an
encyclical
letter
which
was
intended
as
a
rebuke
to
some
young
french
catholics
lamennais
and
his
friends
who
had
conceived
the
promising
idea
of
transforming
the
church
by
the
liberal
spirit
of
the
day
the
pope
denounces
absurd
and
erroneous
maxim
or
rather
insanity
that
liberty
of
conscience
should
be
procured
and
guaranteed
to
every
one
the
path
to
this
pernicious
error
is
prepared
by
that
full
and
unlimited
liberty
of
thought
which
is
spread
abroad
to
the
misfortune
of
church
and
state
and
which
certain
persons
with
excessive
impudence
venture
to
represent
as
an
advantage
for
religion
hence
comes
the
corruption
of
youth
contempt
for
religion
and
for
the
most
venerable
laws
and
a
general
mental
change
in
the
short
the
most
deadly
scourge
of
society
since
the
experience
of
history
has
shown
that
the
states
which
have
shone
by
their
wealth
and
power
and
glory
have
perished
just
by
this
immoderate
freedom
of
opinion
licence
of
conversation
and
love
of
novelties
with
this
is
connected
the
liberty
of
publishing
any
writing
of
any
kind
this
is
a
deadly
and
execrable
liberty
for
which
we
can
not
feel
sufficient
horror
though
some
men
dare
to
acclaim
it
noisily
and
a
generation
later
pius
ix
was
to
astonish
the
world
by
a
similar
syllabus
of
modern
errors
yet
notwithstanding
the
fundamental
antagonism
between
the
principles
of
the
church
and
the
drift
of
modern
civilization
the
papacy
survives
powerful
and
respected
in
a
world
where
the
ideas
which
it
condemned
have
become
the
commonplace
conditions
of
life
the
progress
of
western
nations
from
the
system
of
unity
which
prevailed
in
the
fifteenth
to
the
system
of
liberty
which
was
the
rule
in
the
nineteenth
century
was
slow
and
painful
illogical
and
wavering
generally
dictated
by
political
necessities
seldom
inspired
by
deliberate
conviction
we
have
seen
how
religious
liberty
has
been
realized
so
far
as
the
law
is
concerned
under
two
distinct
systems
and
but
legal
toleration
may
coexist
with
much
practical
intolerance
and
liberty
before
the
law
is
compatible
with
serious
disabilities
of
which
the
law
can
not
take
account
for
instance
the
expression
of
unorthodox
opinions
may
exclude
a
man
from
obtaining
a
secular
post
or
hinder
his
advancement
the
question
has
been
asked
which
of
the
two
systems
is
more
favourable
to
the
creation
of
a
tolerant
social
atmosphere
ruffini
of
whose
excellent
work
on
religious
liberty
i
have
made
much
use
in
this
chapter
decides
in
favour
of
jurisdiction
he
points
out
that
while
socinus
a
true
friend
of
liberty
of
thought
contemplated
this
system
the
anabaptists
whose
spirit
was
intolerant
sought
separation
more
important
is
the
observation
that
in
germany
england
and
italy
where
the
most
powerful
church
or
churches
are
under
the
control
of
the
state
there
is
more
freedom
more
tolerance
of
opinion
than
in
many
of
the
american
states
where
separation
prevails
a
hundred
years
ago
the
americans
showed
appalling
ingratitude
to
thomas
paine
who
had
done
them
eminent
service
in
the
war
of
independence
simply
because
he
published
a
very
unorthodox
book
it
is
notorious
that
free
thought
is
still
a
serious
hindrance
and
handicap
to
an
american
even
in
most
of
the
universities
this
proves
that
separation
is
not
an
infallible
receipt
for
producing
tolerance
but
i
see
no
reason
to
suppose
that
public
opinion
in
america
would
be
different
if
either
the
federal
republic
or
the
particular
states
had
adopted
jurisdiction
given
legal
liberty
under
either
system
i
should
say
that
the
tolerance
of
public
opinion
depends
on
social
conditions
and
especially
on
the
degree
of
culture
among
the
educated
classes
from
this
sketch
it
will
be
seen
that
toleration
was
the
outcome
of
new
political
circumstances
and
necessities
brought
about
by
the
disunion
of
the
church
through
the
reformation
but
it
meant
that
in
those
states
which
granted
toleration
the
opinion
of
a
sufficiently
influential
group
of
the
governing
class
was
ripe
for
the
change
and
this
new
mental
attitude
was
in
a
great
measure
due
to
the
scepticism
and
rationalism
which
were
diffused
by
the
renaissance
movement
and
which
subtly
and
unconsciously
had
affected
the
minds
of
many
who
were
sincerely
devoted
to
rigidly
orthodox
beliefs
so
effective
is
the
force
of
suggestion
in
the
next
two
chapters
the
advance
of
reason
at
the
expense
of
faith
will
be
traced
through
the
seventeenth
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
translated
by
lecky
complete
toleration
was
established
by
penn

the
quaker

in

chapter
vi
the
growth
of
rationalism
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
during
the
last
three
hundred
years
reason
has
been
slowly
but
steadily
destroying
christian
mythology
and
exposing
the
pretensions
of
supernatural
revelation
the
progress
of
rationalism
falls
naturally
into
two
periods
in
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
those
thinkers
who
rejected
christian
theology
and
the
book
on
which
it
relies
were
mainly
influenced
by
the
inconsistencies
contradictions
and
absurdities
which
they
discovered
in
the
evidence
and
by
the
moral
difficulties
of
the
creed
some
scientific
facts
were
known
which
seemed
to
reflect
on
the
accuracy
of
revelation
but
arguments
based
on
science
were
subsidiary
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
discoveries
of
science
in
many
fields
bore
with
full
force
upon
fabrics
which
had
been
constructed
in
a
naïve
and
ignorant
age
and
historical
criticism
undermined
methodically
the
authority
of
the
sacred
documents
which
had
hitherto
been
exposed
chiefly
to
the
acute
but
unmethodical
criticisms
of
common
sense
a
disinterested
love
of
facts
without
any
regard
to
the
bearing
which
those
facts
may
have
on
hopes
or
fears
or
destiny
is
a
rare
quality
in
all
ages
and
it
had
been
very
rare
indeed
since
the
ancient
days
of
greece
and
rome
it
means
the
scientific
spirit
now
in
the
seventeenth
century
we
may
say
without
disrespect
to
a
few
precursors
that
the
modern
study
of
natural
science
began
and
in
the
same
period
we
have
a
series
of
famous
thinkers
who
were
guided
by
a
disinterested
love
of
truth
of
the
most
acute
minds
some
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
christian
scheme
of
the
world
is
irrational
and
according
to
their
temperament
some
rejected
it
whilst
others
like
the
great
frenchman
pascal
fell
back
upon
an
unreasoning
act
of
faith
bacon
who
professed
orthodoxy
was
perhaps
at
heart
a
deist
but
in
any
case
the
whole
spirit
of
his
writings
was
to
exclude
authority
from
the
domain
of
scientific
investigation
which
he
did
so
much
to
stimulate
descartes
illustrious
not
only
as
the
founder
of
modern
metaphysics
but
also
by
his
original
contributions
to
science
might
seek
to
conciliate
the
ecclesiastical
temper
was
but
his
philosophical
method
was
a
powerful
incentive
to
rationalistic
thought
the
general
tendency
of
superior
intellects
was
to
exalt
reason
at
the
expense
of
authority
and
in
england
this
principle
was
established
so
firmly
by
locke
that
throughout
the
theological
warfare
of
the
eighteenth
century
both
parties
relied
on
reason
and
no
theologian
of
repute
assumed
faith
to
be
a
higher
faculty
a
striking
illustration
of
the
gradual
encroachments
of
reason
is
the
change
which
was
silently
wrought
in
public
opinion
on
the
subject
of
witchcraft
the
famous
efforts
of
james
i
to
carry
out
the
biblical
command
shalt
not
suffer
a
witch
to
live
were
outdone
by
the
zeal
of
the
puritans
under
the
commonwealth
to
suppress
the
wicked
old
women
who
had
commerce
with
satan
after
the
restoration
the
belief
in
witchcraft
declined
among
educated
some
able
writers
maintained
there
were
few
executions
the
last
trial
of
a
witch
was
in
when
some
clergymen
in
hertfordshire
prosecuted
jane
wenham
the
jury
found
her
guilty
but
the
judge
who
had
summed
up
in
her
favour
was
able
to
procure
the
remission
of
her
sentence
and
the
laws
against
witchcraft
were
repealed
in
john
wesley
said
with
perfect
truth
that
to
disbelieve
in
witchcraft
is
to
disbelieve
in
the
bible
in
france
and
in
holland
the
decline
of
belief
and
interest
in
this
particular
form
of
activity
was
simultaneous
in
scotland
where
theology
was
very
powerful
a
woman
was
burnt
in
it
can
be
no
mere
coincidence
that
the
general
decline
of
this
superstition
belongs
to
the
age
which
saw
the
rise
of
modern
science
and
modern
philosophy
hobbes
who
was
perhaps
the
most
brilliant
english
thinker
of
the
seventeenth
century
was
a
freethinker
and
materialist
he
had
come
under
the
influence
of
his
friend
the
french
philosopher
gassendi
who
had
revived
materialism
in
its
epicurean
shape
yet
he
was
a
champion
not
of
freedom
of
conscience
but
of
coercion
in
its
most
uncompromising
form
in
the
political
theory
which
he
expounded
in
leviathan
the
sovran
has
autocratic
power
in
the
domain
of
doctrine
as
in
everything
else
and
it
is
the
duty
of
subjects
to
conform
to
the
religion
which
the
sovran
imposes
religious
persecution
is
thus
defended
but
no
independent
power
is
left
to
the
church
but
the
principles
on
which
hobbes
built
up
his
theory
were
rationalistic
he
separated
morality
from
religion
and
identified
true
moral
with
the
doctrine
of
the
laws
of
what
he
really
thought
of
religion
could
be
inferred
from
his
remark
that
the
fanciful
fear
of
things
invisible
due
to
ignorance
is
the
natural
seed
of
that
feeling
which
in
himself
a
man
calls
religion
but
in
those
who
fear
or
worship
the
invisible
power
differently
superstition
in
the
reign
of
charles
ii
hobbes
was
silenced
and
his
books
were
burned
spinoza
the
jewish
philosopher
of
holland
owed
a
great
deal
to
descartes
and
in
political
speculation
to
hobbes
but
his
philosophy
meant
a
far
wider
and
more
open
breach
with
orthodox
opinion
than
either
of
his
masters
had
ventured
on
he
conceived
ultimate
reality
which
he
called
god
as
an
absolutely
perfect
impersonal
being
a
substance
whose
nature
is
constituted
by
two
thought
and
spatial
extension
when
spinoza
speaks
of
love
of
god
in
which
he
considered
happiness
to
consist
he
means
knowledge
and
contemplation
of
the
order
of
nature
including
human
nature
which
is
subject
to
fixed
invariable
laws
he
rejects
and
the
as
he
calls
it
of
final
causes
in
nature
if
we
want
to
label
his
philosophy
we
may
say
that
it
is
a
form
of
pantheism
it
has
often
been
described
as
atheism
if
atheism
means
as
i
suppose
in
ordinary
use
it
is
generally
taken
to
mean
rejection
of
a
personal
god
spinoza
was
an
atheist
it
should
be
observed
that
in
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
atheist
was
used
in
the
wildest
way
as
a
term
of
abuse
for
freethinkers
and
when
we
read
of
atheists
except
in
careful
writers
we
may
generally
assume
that
the
persons
so
stigmatized
were
really
deists
that
is
they
believed
in
a
personal
god
but
not
in
revelation
daring
philosophy
was
not
in
harmony
with
the
general
trend
of
speculation
at
the
time
and
did
not
exert
any
profound
influence
on
thought
till
a
much
later
period
the
thinker
whose
writings
appealed
most
to
the
men
of
his
age
and
were
most
opportune
and
effective
was
john
locke
who
professed
more
or
less
orthodox
anglicanism
his
great
contribution
to
philosophy
is
equivalent
to
a
very
powerful
defence
of
reason
against
the
usurpations
of
authority
the
object
of
his
essay
on
the
human
understanding
is
to
show
that
all
knowledge
is
derived
from
experience
he
subordinated
faith
completely
to
reason
while
he
accepted
the
christian
revelation
he
held
that
revelation
if
it
contradicted
the
higher
tribunal
of
reason
must
be
rejected
and
that
revelation
can
not
give
us
knowledge
as
certain
as
the
knowledge
which
reason
gives
that
takes
away
reason
to
make
room
for
revelation
puts
out
the
light
of
both
and
does
much
what
the
same
as
if
he
would
persuade
a
man
to
put
out
his
eyes
the
better
to
receive
the
remote
light
of
an
invisible
star
by
a
he
wrote
a
book
to
show
that
the
christian
revelation
is
not
contrary
to
reason
and
its
title
the
reasonableness
of
christianity
sounds
the
note
of
all
religious
controversy
in
england
during
the
next
hundred
years
both
the
orthodox
and
their
opponents
warmly
agreed
that
reasonableness
was
the
only
test
of
the
claims
of
revealed
religion
it
was
under
the
direct
influence
of
locke
that
toland
an
irishman
who
had
been
converted
from
roman
catholicism
composed
a
sensational
book
christianity
not
mysterious
he
assumes
that
christianity
is
true
and
argues
that
there
can
be
no
mysteries
in
it
because
mysteries
that
is
unintelligible
dogmas
can
not
be
accepted
by
reason
and
if
a
reasonable
deity
gave
a
revelation
its
purpose
must
be
to
enlighten
not
to
puzzle
the
assumption
of
the
truth
of
christianity
was
a
mere
pretence
as
an
intelligent
reader
could
not
fail
to
see
the
work
was
important
because
it
drew
the
logical
inference
from
philosophy
and
it
had
a
wide
circulation
lady
mary
wortley
montagu
met
a
turkish
effendi
at
belgrade
who
asked
her
for
news
of
toland
it
is
characteristic
of
this
stage
of
the
struggle
between
reason
and
authority
that
excepting
the
leading
french
thinkers
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
rationalists
who
attacked
theology
generally
feigned
to
acknowledge
the
truth
of
the
ideas
which
they
were
assailing
they
pretended
that
their
speculations
did
not
affect
religion
they
could
separate
the
domains
of
reason
and
of
faith
they
could
show
that
revelation
was
superfluous
without
questioning
it
they
could
do
homage
to
orthodoxy
and
lay
down
views
with
which
orthodoxy
was
irreconcilable
the
errors
which
they
exposed
in
the
sphere
of
reason
were
ironically
allowed
to
be
truths
in
the
sphere
of
theology
the
mediaeval
principle
of
double
truth
and
other
shifts
were
resorted
to
in
against
the
tyranny
of
they
did
not
always
avail
and
in
reading
much
of
the
rationalistic
literature
of
this
period
we
have
to
read
between
the
lines
bayle
is
an
interesting
instance
if
philosophy
by
setting
authority
in
its
place
and
deriving
all
knowledge
from
experience
was
a
powerful
aid
to
rationalism
his
contemporary
bayle
worked
in
the
same
direction
by
the
investigation
of
history
driven
from
france
see
above
he
lived
at
amsterdam
where
he
published
his
philosophical
dictionary
he
was
really
a
freethinker
but
he
never
dropped
the
disguise
of
orthodoxy
and
this
lends
a
particular
piquancy
to
his
work
he
takes
a
delight
in
marshalling
all
the
objections
which
heretics
had
made
to
essential
christian
dogmas
he
exposed
without
mercy
the
crimes
and
brutalities
of
david
and
showed
that
this
favourite
of
the
almighty
was
a
person
with
whom
one
would
refuse
to
shake
hands
there
was
a
great
outcry
at
this
unedifying
candour
bayle
in
replying
adopted
the
attitude
of
montaigne
and
pascal
and
opposed
faith
to
reason
the
theological
virtue
of
faith
he
said
consists
in
believing
revealed
truths
simply
and
solely
on
authority
if
you
believe
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
for
philosophical
reasons
you
are
orthodox
but
you
have
no
part
in
faith
the
merit
of
faith
becomes
greater
in
proportion
as
the
revealed
truth
surpasses
all
the
powers
of
our
mind
the
more
incomprehensible
the
truth
and
the
more
repugnant
to
reason
the
greater
is
the
sacrifice
we
make
in
accepting
it
the
deeper
our
submission
to
god
therefore
a
merciless
inventory
of
the
objections
which
reason
has
to
urge
against
fundamental
doctrines
serves
to
exalt
the
merits
of
faith
the
dictionary
was
also
criticized
for
the
justice
done
to
the
moral
excellencies
of
persons
who
denied
the
existence
of
god
bayle
replies
that
if
he
had
been
able
to
find
any
atheistical
thinkers
who
lived
bad
lives
he
would
have
been
delighted
to
dwell
on
their
vices
but
he
knew
of
none
such
as
for
the
criminals
you
meet
in
history
whose
abominable
actions
make
you
tremble
their
impieties
and
blasphemies
prove
they
believed
in
a
divinity
this
is
a
natural
consequence
of
the
theological
doctrine
that
the
devil
who
is
incapable
of
atheism
is
the
instigator
of
all
the
sins
of
men
for
wickedness
must
clearly
resemble
that
of
the
devil
and
must
therefore
be
joined
to
a
belief
in
existence
since
the
devil
is
not
an
atheist
and
is
it
not
a
proof
of
the
infinite
wisdom
of
god
that
the
worst
criminals
are
not
atheists
and
that
most
of
the
atheists
whose
names
are
recorded
have
been
honest
men
by
this
arrangement
providence
sets
bounds
to
the
corruption
of
man
for
if
atheism
and
moral
wickedness
were
united
in
the
same
persons
the
societies
of
earth
would
be
exposed
to
a
fatal
inundation
of
sin
there
was
much
more
in
the
same
vein
and
the
upshot
was
under
the
thin
veil
of
serving
faith
to
show
that
the
christian
dogmas
were
essentially
unreasonable
work
marked
by
scholarship
and
extraordinary
learning
had
a
great
influence
in
england
as
well
as
in
france
it
supplied
weapons
to
assailants
of
christianity
in
both
countries
at
first
the
assault
was
carried
on
with
most
vigour
and
ability
by
the
english
deists
who
though
their
writings
are
little
read
now
did
memorable
work
by
their
polemic
against
the
authority
of
revealed
religion
the
controversy
between
the
deists
and
their
orthodox
opponents
turned
on
the
question
whether
the
deity
of
natural
religion
god
whose
existence
as
was
thought
could
be
proved
by
be
identified
with
the
author
of
the
christian
revelation
to
the
deists
this
seemed
impossible
the
nature
of
the
alleged
revelation
seemed
inconsistent
with
the
character
of
the
god
to
whom
reason
pointed
the
defenders
of
revelation
at
least
all
the
most
competent
agreed
with
the
deists
in
making
reason
supreme
and
through
this
reliance
on
reason
some
of
them
fell
into
heresies
clarke
for
instance
one
of
the
ablest
was
very
unsound
on
the
dogma
of
the
trinity
it
is
also
to
be
noticed
that
with
both
sections
the
interest
of
morality
was
the
principal
motive
the
orthodox
held
that
the
revealed
doctrine
of
future
rewards
and
punishments
is
necessary
for
morality
the
deists
that
morality
depends
on
reason
alone
and
that
revelation
contains
a
great
deal
that
is
repugnant
to
moral
ideals
throughout
the
eighteenth
century
morality
was
the
guiding
consideration
with
anglican
churchmen
and
religious
emotion
finding
no
satisfaction
within
the
church
was
driven
as
it
were
outside
and
sought
an
outlet
in
the
methodism
of
wesley
and
whitefield
spinoza
had
laid
down
the
principle
that
scripture
must
be
interpreted
like
any
other
book
and
with
the
deists
this
principle
was
fundamental
in
order
to
avoid
persecution
they
generally
veiled
their
conclusions
under
sufficiently
thin
disguises
hitherto
the
press
licensing
act
had
very
effectually
prevented
the
publication
of
heterodox
works
and
it
is
from
orthodox
works
denouncing
infidel
opinions
that
we
know
how
rationalism
was
spreading
but
in
the
press
law
was
allowed
to
drop
and
immediately
deistic
literature
began
to
appear
there
was
however
the
danger
of
prosecution
under
the
blasphemy
laws
there
were
three
legal
weapons
for
coercing
those
who
attacked
christianity
the
ecclesiastical
courts
had
and
have
the
power
of
imprisoning
for
a
maximum
term
of
six
months
for
atheism
blasphemy
heresy
and
damnable
opinions
the
common
law
as
interpreted
by
lord
chief
justice
hale
in
when
a
certain
taylor
was
charged
with
having
said
that
religion
was
a
cheat
and
blasphemed
against
christ
the
accused
was
condemned
to
a
fine
and
the
pillory
by
the
judge
who
ruled
that
the
court
of
bench
has
jurisdiction
in
such
a
case
inasmuch
as
blasphemous
words
of
the
kind
are
an
offence
against
the
laws
and
the
state
and
to
speak
against
christianity
is
to
speak
in
subversion
of
the
law
since
christianity
is
of
the
laws
of
the
statute
of
enacts
that
if
any
person
educated
in
the
christian
religion
by
writing
printing
teaching
or
advised
speaking
deny
any
one
of
the
persons
in
the
holy
trinity
to
be
god
or
shall
assert
or
maintain
there
are
more
gods
than
one
or
shall
deny
the
christian
religion
to
be
true
or
shall
deny
the
holy
scriptures
of
the
old
and
new
testament
to
be
of
divine
authority
is
convicted
he
shall
for
the
first
offence
be
adjudged
incapable
to
hold
any
public
offices
or
employments
and
on
the
second
shall
lose
his
civil
rights
and
be
imprisoned
for
three
years
this
statute
expressly
states
as
its
motive
the
fact
that
persons
have
of
late
years
openly
avowed
and
published
many
blasphemous
and
impious
opinions
contrary
to
the
doctrine
and
principles
of
the
christian
as
a
matter
of
fact
most
trials
for
blasphemy
during
the
past
two
hundred
years
fall
under
the
second
head
but
the
new
statute
of
was
very
intimidating
and
we
can
easily
understand
how
it
drove
heterodox
writers
to
ambiguous
disguises
one
of
these
disguises
was
allegorical
interpretation
of
scripture
they
showed
that
literal
interpretation
led
to
absurdities
or
to
inconsistencies
with
the
wisdom
and
justice
of
god
and
pretended
to
infer
that
allegorical
interpretation
must
be
substituted
but
they
meant
the
reader
to
reject
their
pretended
solution
and
draw
a
conclusion
damaging
to
revelation
among
the
arguments
used
in
favour
of
the
truth
of
revelation
the
fulfilment
of
prophecies
and
the
miracles
of
the
new
testament
were
conspicuous
anthony
collins
a
country
gentleman
who
was
a
disciple
of
locke
published
in
his
discourse
on
the
grounds
and
reasons
of
the
christian
religion
in
which
he
drastically
exposed
the
weakness
of
the
evidence
for
fulfilment
of
prophecy
depending
as
it
does
on
forced
and
unnatural
figurative
interpretations
twenty
years
before
he
had
written
a
discourse
of
in
which
influence
is
evident
pleading
for
free
discussion
and
the
reference
of
all
religious
questions
to
reason
he
complained
of
the
general
intolerance
which
prevailed
but
the
same
facts
which
testify
to
intolerance
testify
also
to
the
spread
of
unbelief
collins
escaped
with
comparative
impunity
but
thomas
woolston
a
fellow
of
sidney
sussex
college
cambridge
who
wrote
six
aggressive
discourses
on
the
miracles
of
our
saviour
paid
the
penalty
for
his
audacity
deprived
of
his
fellowship
he
was
prosecuted
for
libel
and
sentenced
to
a
fine
of
and
a
imprisonment
unable
to
pay
he
died
in
prison
he
does
not
adopt
the
line
of
arguing
that
miracles
are
incredible
or
impossible
he
examines
the
chief
miracles
related
in
the
gospels
and
shows
with
great
ability
and
shrewd
common
sense
that
they
are
absurd
or
unworthy
of
the
performer
he
pointed
out
as
huxley
was
to
point
out
in
a
controversy
with
gladstone
that
the
miraculous
driving
of
devils
into
a
herd
of
swine
was
an
unwarrantable
injury
to
property
on
the
story
of
the
divine
blasting
of
the
fig
tree
he
remarks
if
a
yeoman
of
kent
should
go
to
look
for
pippins
in
his
orchard
at
easter
the
supposed
time
that
jesus
sought
for
these
figs
and
because
of
a
disappointment
cut
down
his
trees
what
then
would
his
neighbours
make
of
him
nothing
less
than
a
and
if
the
story
got
into
our
publick
news
he
would
be
the
jest
and
ridicule
of
or
take
his
comment
on
the
miracle
of
the
pool
of
bethesda
where
an
angel
used
to
trouble
the
waters
and
the
man
who
first
entered
the
pool
was
cured
of
his
infirmity
odd
and
a
merry
way
of
conferring
a
divine
mercy
and
one
would
think
that
the
angels
of
god
did
this
for
their
own
diversion
more
than
to
do
good
to
mankind
just
as
some
throw
a
bone
among
a
kennel
of
hounds
for
the
pleasure
of
seeing
them
quarrel
for
it
or
as
others
cast
a
piece
of
money
among
a
company
of
boys
for
the
sport
of
seeing
them
scramble
for
it
so
was
the
pastime
of
the
angels
in
dealing
with
the
healing
of
the
woman
who
suffered
from
a
bloody
flux
he
asks
if
we
had
been
told
of
the
curing
an
haemorrhage
like
this
before
us
what
would
protestants
have
said
to
it
why
a
foolish
credulous
and
superstitious
woman
had
fancied
herself
cured
of
some
slight
indisposition
and
the
crafty
pope
and
his
adherents
aspiring
after
popular
applause
magnified
the
presumed
cure
into
a
the
application
of
such
a
supposed
story
of
a
miracle
wrought
by
the
pope
is
easy
and
if
infidels
jews
and
mahometans
who
have
no
better
opinion
of
jesus
than
we
have
of
the
pope
should
make
it
no
help
for
woolston
professed
no
doubts
of
the
inspiration
of
scripture
while
he
argued
that
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
suppose
the
miracles
literally
true
he
pretended
to
believe
in
the
fantastic
theory
that
they
were
intended
allegorically
as
figures
of
mysterious
operations
in
the
soul
of
man
origen
a
not
very
orthodox
christian
father
had
employed
the
allegorical
method
and
woolston
quotes
him
in
his
favour
his
vigorous
criticisms
vary
in
value
but
many
of
them
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
and
the
fashion
of
some
modern
critics
to
pass
over
productions
as
unimportant
because
they
are
or
coarse
is
perfectly
unjust
the
pamphlets
had
an
enormous
sale
and
notoriety
is
illustrated
by
the
anecdote
of
the
young
who
met
him
walking
abroad
and
accosted
him
with
old
rogue
are
you
not
hanged
yet
woolston
answered
woman
i
know
you
not
pray
what
have
i
done
to
offend
you
have
writ
against
my
saviour
she
said
would
become
of
my
poor
sinful
soul
if
it
was
not
for
my
dear
saviour
about
the
same
time
matthew
tindal
a
fellow
of
all
souls
attacked
revelation
from
a
more
general
point
of
view
in
his
christianity
as
old
as
the
creation
he
undertook
to
show
that
the
bible
as
a
revelation
is
superfluous
for
it
adds
nothing
to
natural
religion
which
god
revealed
to
man
from
the
very
first
by
the
sole
light
of
reason
he
argues
that
those
who
defend
revealed
religion
by
its
agreement
with
natural
religion
and
thus
set
up
a
double
government
of
reason
and
authority
fall
between
the
two
an
odd
jumble
he
observes
prove
the
truth
of
a
book
by
the
truth
of
the
doctrines
it
contains
and
at
the
same
time
conclude
those
doctrines
to
be
true
because
contained
in
that
he
goes
on
to
criticize
the
bible
in
detail
in
order
to
maintain
its
infallibility
without
doing
violence
to
reason
you
have
when
you
find
irrational
statements
to
torture
them
and
depart
from
the
literal
sense
would
you
think
that
a
mohammedan
was
governed
by
his
koran
who
on
all
occasions
departed
from
the
literal
sense
would
you
not
tell
him
that
his
inspired
book
fell
infinitely
short
of
uninspired
writings
where
there
is
no
such
occasion
to
recede
from
the
letter
as
to
chronological
and
physical
errors
which
seemed
to
endanger
the
infallibility
of
the
scriptures
a
bishop
had
met
the
argument
by
saying
reasonably
enough
that
in
the
bible
god
speaks
according
to
the
conceptions
of
those
to
whom
he
speaks
and
that
it
is
not
the
business
of
revelation
to
rectify
their
opinions
in
such
matters
tindal
made
this
rejoinder
there
no
difference
between
not
rectifying
sentiments
in
those
matters
and
using
himself
such
sentiments
as
needs
be
rectified
or
between
not
mending
logic
and
rhetoric
where
is
defective
and
using
such
himself
or
between
not
contradicting
vulgar
notions
and
confirming
them
by
speaking
according
to
them
can
infinite
wisdom
despair
of
gaining
or
keeping
affections
without
having
recourse
to
such
mean
acts
he
exposes
with
considerable
effect
the
monstrosity
of
the
doctrine
of
exclusive
salvation
must
we
not
consider
he
asks
whether
one
can
be
said
to
be
sent
as
a
saviour
of
mankind
if
he
comes
to
shut
gate
against
those
to
whom
before
he
came
it
was
open
provided
they
followed
the
dictates
of
their
reason
he
criticizes
the
inconsistency
of
the
impartial
and
universal
goodness
of
god
known
to
us
by
the
light
of
nature
with
acts
committed
by
jehovah
or
his
prophets
take
the
cases
in
which
the
order
of
nature
is
violated
to
punish
men
for
crimes
of
which
they
were
not
guilty
such
as
hindering
rain
from
falling
for
three
years
and
a
half
if
god
could
break
in
upon
the
ordinary
rules
of
his
providence
to
punish
the
innocent
for
the
guilty
we
have
no
guarantee
that
if
he
deals
thus
with
us
in
this
life
he
will
not
act
in
the
same
way
in
the
life
to
come
if
the
eternal
rules
of
justice
are
once
broken
how
can
we
imagine
any
stop
but
the
ideals
of
holiness
and
justice
in
the
old
testament
are
strange
indeed
the
holier
men
are
represented
to
be
the
more
cruel
they
seem
and
the
more
addicted
to
cursing
how
surprising
to
find
the
holy
prophet
elisha
cursing
in
the
name
of
the
lord
little
children
for
calling
him
pate
and
what
is
still
more
surprising
two
immediately
devoured
little
children
i
have
remarked
that
theologians
at
this
time
generally
took
the
line
of
basing
christianity
on
reason
and
not
on
faith
an
interesting
little
book
christianity
not
founded
on
argument
couched
in
the
form
of
a
letter
to
a
young
gentleman
at
oxford
by
henry
dodwell
junior
appeared
in
and
pointed
out
the
dangers
of
such
confidence
in
reason
it
is
an
ironical
development
of
the
principle
of
bayle
working
out
the
thesis
that
christianity
is
essentially
unreasonable
and
that
if
you
want
to
believe
reasoning
is
fatal
the
cultivation
of
faith
and
reasoning
produce
contrary
effects
the
philosopher
is
disqualified
for
divine
influences
by
his
very
progress
in
carnal
wisdom
the
gospel
must
be
received
with
all
the
obsequious
submission
of
a
babe
who
has
no
other
disposition
but
to
learn
his
lesson
christ
did
not
propose
his
doctrines
to
investigation
he
did
not
lay
the
arguments
for
his
mission
before
his
disciples
and
give
them
time
to
consider
calmly
of
their
force
and
liberty
to
determine
as
their
reason
should
direct
them
the
apostles
had
no
qualifications
for
the
task
being
the
most
artless
and
illiterate
persons
living
dodwell
exposes
the
absurdity
of
the
protestant
position
to
give
all
men
liberty
to
judge
for
themselves
and
to
expect
at
the
same
time
that
they
shall
be
of
the
mind
is
such
a
scheme
for
unanimity
as
one
would
scarcely
imagine
any
one
could
be
weak
enough
to
devise
in
speculation
and
much
less
that
any
could
ever
be
found
hardy
enough
to
avow
and
propose
it
to
practice
the
men
of
rome
rise
up
in
the
judgment
of
all
considering
persons
against
this
generation
and
shall
condemn
it
for
they
invented
but
the
one
absurdity
of
infallibility
and
behold
a
greater
absurdity
than
infallibility
is
i
have
still
to
speak
of
the
third
earl
of
shaftesbury
whose
style
has
rescued
his
writings
from
entire
neglect
his
special
interest
was
ethics
while
the
valuable
work
of
most
of
the
heterodox
writers
of
this
period
lay
in
their
destructive
criticism
of
supernatural
religion
they
clung
as
we
have
seen
to
what
was
called
natural
the
belief
in
a
kind
and
wise
personal
god
who
created
the
world
governs
it
by
natural
laws
and
desires
our
happiness
the
idea
was
derived
from
ancient
philosophers
and
had
been
revived
by
lord
herbert
of
cherbury
in
his
latin
treatise
on
truth
in
the
reign
of
james
i
the
deists
contended
that
this
was
a
sufficient
basis
for
morality
and
that
the
christian
inducements
to
good
behaviour
were
unnecessary
shaftesbury
in
his
inquiry
concerning
virtue
debated
the
question
and
argued
that
the
scheme
of
heaven
and
hell
with
the
selfish
hopes
and
fears
which
they
inspire
corrupts
morality
and
that
the
only
worthy
motive
for
conduct
is
the
beauty
of
virtue
in
itself
he
does
not
even
consider
deism
a
necessary
assumption
for
a
moral
code
he
admits
that
the
opinion
of
atheists
does
not
undermine
ethics
but
he
thinks
that
the
belief
in
a
good
governor
of
the
universe
is
a
powerful
support
to
the
practice
of
virtue
he
is
a
thorough
optimist
and
is
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
admirable
adaptation
of
means
to
ends
whereby
it
is
the
function
of
one
animal
to
be
food
for
another
he
makes
no
attempt
to
reconcile
the
red
claws
and
teeth
of
nature
with
the
beneficence
of
its
powerful
artist
the
main
all
things
are
kindly
and
well
the
atheist
might
have
said
that
he
preferred
to
be
at
the
mercy
of
blind
chance
than
in
the
hands
of
an
autocrat
who
if
he
pleased
lord
sense
of
order
had
created
flies
to
be
devoured
by
spiders
but
this
was
an
aspect
of
the
universe
which
did
not
much
trouble
thinkers
in
the
eighteenth
century
on
the
other
hand
the
character
of
the
god
of
the
old
testament
roused
aversion
he
attacks
scripture
not
directly
but
by
allusion
or
with
irony
he
hints
that
if
there
is
a
god
he
would
be
less
displeased
with
atheists
than
with
those
who
accepted
him
in
the
guise
of
jehovah
as
plutarch
said
had
rather
men
should
say
of
me
that
there
neither
is
nor
ever
was
such
a
one
as
plutarch
than
they
should
say
was
a
plutarch
an
unsteady
changeable
easily
provokable
and
revengeful
significance
is
that
he
built
up
a
positive
theory
of
morals
and
although
it
had
no
philosophical
depth
his
influence
on
french
and
german
thinkers
of
the
eighteenth
century
was
immense
in
some
ways
perhaps
the
ablest
of
the
deists
and
certainly
the
most
scholarly
was
rev
conyers
middleton
who
remained
within
the
church
he
supported
christianity
on
grounds
of
utility
even
if
it
is
an
imposture
he
said
it
would
be
wrong
to
destroy
it
for
it
is
established
by
law
and
it
has
a
long
tradition
behind
it
some
traditional
religion
is
necessary
and
it
would
be
hopeless
to
supplant
christianity
by
reason
but
his
writings
contain
effective
arguments
which
go
to
undermine
revelation
the
most
important
was
his
free
inquiry
into
christian
miracles
which
put
in
a
new
and
dangerous
light
an
old
question
at
what
time
did
the
church
cease
to
have
the
power
of
performing
miracles
we
shall
see
presently
how
gibbon
applied
method
the
leading
adversaries
of
the
deists
appealed
like
them
to
reason
and
in
appealing
to
reason
did
much
to
undermine
authority
the
ablest
defence
of
the
faith
bishop
analogy
is
suspected
of
having
raised
more
doubts
than
it
appeased
this
was
the
experience
of
william
pitt
the
younger
and
the
analogy
made
james
mill
the
utilitarian
an
unbeliever
the
deists
argued
that
the
unjust
and
cruel
god
of
revelation
could
not
be
the
god
of
nature
butler
pointed
to
nature
and
said
there
you
behold
cruelty
and
injustice
the
argument
was
perfectly
good
against
the
optimism
of
shaftesbury
but
it
plainly
admitted
of
the
to
that
which
butler
wished
to
a
just
and
beneficent
god
does
not
exist
butler
is
driven
to
fall
back
on
the
sceptical
argument
that
we
are
extremely
ignorant
that
all
things
are
possible
even
eternal
hell
fire
and
that
therefore
the
safe
and
prudent
course
is
to
accept
the
christian
doctrine
it
may
be
remarked
that
this
reasoning
with
a
few
modifications
could
be
used
in
favour
of
other
religions
at
mecca
or
at
timbuctoo
he
has
in
effect
revived
the
argument
used
by
pascal
that
if
there
is
one
chance
in
any
very
large
number
that
christianity
is
true
it
is
a
interest
to
be
a
christian
for
if
it
prove
false
it
will
do
him
no
harm
to
have
believed
it
if
it
prove
true
he
will
be
infinitely
the
gainer
butler
seeks
indeed
to
show
that
the
chances
in
favour
amount
to
a
probability
but
his
argument
is
essentially
of
the
same
intellectual
and
moral
value
as
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
it
leads
by
an
easy
logical
step
from
the
anglican
to
the
roman
church
catholics
and
protestants
as
king
henry
iv
of
france
argued
agree
that
a
catholic
may
be
saved
the
catholics
assert
that
a
protestant
will
be
damned
therefore
the
safe
course
is
to
embrace
catholicism
i
have
dwelt
at
some
length
upon
some
of
the
english
deists
because
while
they
occupy
an
important
place
in
the
history
of
rationalism
in
england
they
also
supplied
along
with
bayle
a
great
deal
of
the
thought
which
manipulated
by
brilliant
writers
on
the
other
side
of
the
channel
captured
the
educated
classes
in
france
we
are
now
in
the
age
of
voltaire
he
was
a
convinced
deist
he
considered
that
the
nature
of
the
universe
proved
that
it
was
made
by
a
conscious
architect
he
held
that
god
was
required
in
the
interests
of
conduct
and
he
ardently
combated
atheism
his
great
achievements
were
his
efficacious
labour
in
the
cause
of
toleration
and
his
systematic
warfare
against
superstitions
he
was
profoundly
influenced
by
english
thinkers
especially
locke
and
bolingbroke
this
statesman
had
concealed
his
infidelity
during
his
lifetime
except
from
his
intimates
he
had
lived
long
as
an
exile
in
france
and
his
rationalistic
essays
were
published
after
his
death
voltaire
whose
literary
genius
converted
the
work
of
the
english
thinkers
into
a
did
not
begin
his
campaign
against
christianity
till
after
the
middle
of
the
century
when
superstitious
practices
and
religious
persecutions
were
becoming
a
scandal
in
his
country
he
assailed
the
catholic
church
in
every
field
with
ridicule
and
satire
in
a
little
work
called
the
tomb
of
fanaticism
written
published
he
begins
by
observing
that
a
man
who
accepts
his
religion
as
most
people
do
without
examining
it
is
like
an
ox
which
allows
itself
to
be
harnessed
and
proceeds
to
review
the
difficulties
in
the
bible
the
rise
of
christianity
and
the
course
of
church
history
from
which
he
concludes
that
every
sensible
man
should
hold
the
christian
sect
in
horror
are
blind
to
prefer
an
absurd
and
sanguinary
creed
supported
by
executioners
and
surrounded
by
fiery
faggots
a
creed
which
can
only
be
approved
by
those
to
whom
it
gives
power
and
riches
a
particular
creed
only
accepted
in
a
small
part
of
the
a
simple
and
universal
in
the
sermon
of
the
fifty
and
the
questions
of
zapata
we
can
see
what
he
owed
to
bayle
and
english
critics
but
his
touch
is
lighter
and
his
irony
more
telling
his
comment
on
geographical
mistakes
in
the
old
testament
is
was
evidently
not
strong
in
having
called
attention
to
the
of
wife
in
looking
backward
and
her
conversion
into
a
pillar
of
salt
he
hopes
that
the
stories
of
scripture
will
make
us
better
if
they
do
not
make
us
more
enlightened
one
of
his
favourite
methods
is
to
approach
christian
doctrines
as
a
person
who
had
just
heard
of
the
existence
of
christians
or
jews
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
his
drama
saul
which
the
police
tried
to
suppress
presents
the
career
of
david
the
man
after
own
heart
in
all
its
naked
horror
the
scene
in
which
samuel
reproves
saul
for
not
having
slain
agag
will
give
an
idea
of
the
spirit
of
the
piece
samuel
god
commands
me
to
tell
you
that
he
repents
of
having
made
you
king
saul
god
repents
only
they
who
commit
errors
repent
his
eternal
wisdom
can
not
be
unwise
god
can
not
commit
errors
samuel
he
can
repent
of
having
set
on
the
throne
those
who
do
saul
well
who
does
not
tell
me
what
is
my
fault
samuel
you
have
pardoned
a
king
agag
what
is
the
fairest
of
virtues
considered
a
crime
in
judea
samuel
to
agag
silence
do
not
blaspheme
to
saul
saul
formerly
king
of
the
jews
did
not
god
command
you
by
my
mouth
to
destroy
all
the
amalekites
without
sparing
women
or
maidens
or
children
at
the
breast
agag
your
such
a
command
you
are
mistaken
you
meant
to
say
your
devil
samuel
saul
did
you
obey
god
saul
i
did
not
suppose
such
a
command
was
positive
i
thought
that
goodness
was
the
first
attribute
of
the
supreme
being
and
that
a
compassionate
heart
could
not
displease
him
samuel
you
are
mistaken
unbeliever
god
reproves
you
your
sceptre
will
pass
into
other
hands
perhaps
no
writer
has
ever
roused
more
hatred
in
christendom
than
voltaire
he
was
looked
on
as
a
sort
of
that
was
natural
his
attacks
were
so
tremendously
effective
at
the
time
but
he
has
been
sometimes
decried
on
the
ground
that
he
only
demolished
and
made
no
effort
to
build
up
where
he
had
pulled
down
this
is
a
narrow
complaint
it
might
be
replied
that
when
a
sewer
is
spreading
plague
in
a
town
we
can
not
wait
to
remove
it
till
we
have
a
new
system
of
drains
and
it
may
fairly
be
said
that
religion
as
practised
in
contemporary
france
was
a
poisonous
sewer
but
the
true
answer
is
that
knowledge
and
therefore
civilization
are
advanced
by
criticism
and
negation
as
well
as
by
construction
and
positive
discovery
when
a
man
has
the
talent
to
attack
with
effect
falsehood
prejudice
and
imposture
it
is
his
duty
if
there
are
any
social
duties
to
use
it
for
constructive
thinking
we
must
go
to
the
other
great
leader
of
french
thought
rousseau
who
contributed
to
the
growth
of
freedom
in
a
different
way
he
was
a
deist
but
his
deism
unlike
that
of
voltaire
was
religious
and
emotional
he
regarded
christianity
with
a
sort
of
reverent
scepticism
but
his
thought
was
revolutionary
and
repugnant
to
orthodoxy
it
made
against
authority
in
every
sphere
and
it
had
an
enormous
influence
the
clergy
perhaps
dreaded
his
theories
more
than
the
scoffs
and
negations
of
voltaire
for
some
years
he
was
a
fugitive
on
the
face
of
the
earth
émile
his
brilliant
contribution
to
the
theory
of
education
appeared
in
it
contains
some
remarkable
pages
on
religion
profession
of
faith
of
a
savoyard
vicar
in
which
the
deistic
faith
is
strongly
affirmed
and
revelation
and
theology
rejected
the
book
was
publicly
burned
in
paris
and
an
order
issued
for
arrest
forced
by
his
friends
to
flee
he
was
debarred
from
returning
to
geneva
for
the
government
of
that
canton
followed
the
example
of
paris
he
sought
refuge
in
the
canton
of
bern
and
was
ordered
to
quit
he
then
fled
to
the
principality
of
neufchâtel
which
belonged
to
prussia
frederick
the
great
the
one
really
tolerant
ruler
of
the
age
gave
him
protection
but
he
was
persecuted
and
calumniated
by
the
local
clergy
who
but
for
frederick
would
have
expelled
him
and
he
went
to
england
for
a
few
months
then
returning
to
france
where
he
was
left
unmolested
till
his
death
the
religious
views
of
rousseau
are
only
a
minor
point
in
his
heretical
speculations
it
was
by
his
daring
social
and
political
theories
that
he
set
the
world
on
fire
his
social
contract
in
which
these
theories
were
set
forth
was
burned
at
geneva
though
his
principles
will
not
stand
criticism
for
a
moment
and
though
his
doctrine
worked
mischief
by
its
extraordinary
power
of
turning
men
into
fanatics
yet
it
contributed
to
progress
by
helping
to
discredit
privilege
and
to
establish
the
view
that
the
object
of
a
state
is
to
secure
the
wellbeing
of
all
its
members
in
the
form
of
rousseau
or
the
christian
form
of
a
house
built
on
the
sand
and
thinkers
arose
in
france
england
and
germany
to
shatter
its
foundations
in
france
it
proved
to
be
only
a
inn
to
atheism
in
french
readers
were
startled
by
the
appearance
of
baron
system
of
nature
in
which
existence
and
the
immortality
of
the
soul
were
denied
and
the
world
declared
to
be
matter
spontaneously
moving
holbach
was
a
friend
of
diderot
who
had
also
come
to
reject
deism
all
the
leading
ideas
in
the
revolt
against
the
church
had
a
place
in
great
work
the
encyclopedia
in
which
a
number
of
leading
thinkers
collaborated
with
him
it
was
not
merely
a
scientific
book
of
reference
it
was
representative
of
the
whole
movement
of
the
enemies
of
faith
it
was
intended
to
lead
men
from
christianity
with
its
original
sin
to
a
new
conception
of
the
world
as
a
place
which
can
be
made
agreeable
and
in
which
the
actual
evils
are
due
not
to
radical
faults
of
human
nature
but
to
perverse
institutions
and
perverse
education
to
divert
interest
from
the
dogmas
of
religion
to
the
improvement
of
society
to
persuade
the
world
that
felicity
depends
not
on
revelation
but
on
social
was
what
diderot
and
rousseau
in
their
different
ways
did
so
much
to
effect
and
their
work
influenced
those
who
did
not
abandon
orthodoxy
it
affected
the
spirit
of
the
church
itself
contrast
the
catholic
church
in
france
in
the
eighteenth
and
in
the
nineteenth
century
without
the
work
of
voltaire
rousseau
diderot
and
their
would
it
have
been
reformed
christian
i
quote
lord
morley
assimilating
as
rapidly
as
their
formulae
will
permit
the
new
light
and
the
more
generous
moral
ideas
and
the
higher
spirituality
of
teachers
who
have
abandoned
all
churches
and
who
are
systematically
denounced
as
enemies
of
the
souls
of
in
england
the
prevalent
deistic
thought
did
not
lead
to
the
same
intellectual
consequences
as
in
france
yet
hume
the
greatest
english
philosopher
of
the
century
showed
that
the
arguments
commonly
adduced
for
a
personal
god
were
untenable
i
may
first
speak
of
his
discussion
on
miracles
in
his
essay
on
miracles
and
in
his
philosophical
inquiry
concerning
human
understanding
hitherto
the
credibility
of
miracles
had
not
been
submitted
to
a
general
examination
independent
of
theological
assumptions
hume
pointing
out
that
there
must
be
a
uniform
experience
against
every
miraculous
event
otherwise
it
would
not
merit
the
name
of
miracle
and
that
it
will
require
stronger
testimony
to
establish
a
miracle
than
an
event
which
is
not
contrary
to
experience
lays
down
the
general
maxim
that
testimony
is
sufficient
to
establish
a
miracle
unless
the
testimony
is
of
such
a
kind
that
its
falsehood
would
be
more
miraculous
than
the
fact
which
it
endeavours
to
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
testimony
exists
of
which
the
falsehood
would
be
a
prodigy
we
can
not
find
in
history
any
miracle
attested
by
a
sufficient
number
of
men
of
such
unquestionable
good
sense
education
and
learning
as
to
secure
us
against
all
delusion
in
themselves
of
such
undoubted
integrity
as
to
place
them
beyond
all
suspicion
of
any
design
to
deceive
others
of
such
credit
in
the
eyes
of
mankind
as
to
have
a
great
deal
to
lose
in
case
of
their
being
detected
in
any
falsehood
and
at
the
same
time
attesting
facts
performed
in
such
a
public
manner
as
to
render
detection
unavoidable
which
circumstances
are
requisite
to
give
us
a
full
assurance
in
the
testimony
of
men
in
the
dialogues
on
natural
religion
which
were
not
published
till
after
his
death
hume
made
an
attack
on
the
from
design
on
which
deists
and
christians
alike
relied
to
prove
the
existence
of
a
deity
the
argument
is
that
the
world
presents
clear
marks
of
design
endless
adaptation
of
means
to
ends
which
can
only
be
explained
as
due
to
the
deliberate
plan
of
a
powerful
intelligence
hume
disputes
the
inference
on
the
ground
that
a
mere
intelligent
being
is
not
a
sufficient
cause
to
explain
the
effect
for
the
argument
must
be
that
the
system
of
the
material
world
demands
as
a
cause
a
corresponding
system
of
interconnected
ideas
but
such
a
mental
system
would
demand
an
explanation
of
its
existence
just
as
much
as
the
material
world
and
thus
we
find
ourselves
committed
to
an
endless
series
of
causes
but
in
any
case
even
if
the
argument
held
it
would
prove
only
the
existence
of
a
deity
whose
powers
though
superior
to
might
be
very
limited
and
whose
workmanship
might
be
very
imperfect
for
this
world
may
be
very
faulty
compared
to
a
superior
standard
it
may
be
the
first
rude
experiment
some
infant
deity
who
afterwards
abandoned
it
ashamed
of
his
lame
or
the
work
of
some
inferior
deity
at
which
his
superior
would
scoff
or
the
production
of
some
old
superannuated
deity
which
since
his
death
has
pursued
an
adventurous
career
from
the
first
impulse
which
he
gave
it
an
argument
which
leaves
such
deities
in
the
running
is
worse
than
useless
for
the
purposes
of
deism
or
of
christianity
the
sceptical
philosophy
of
hume
had
less
influence
on
the
general
public
than
decline
and
fall
of
the
roman
empire
of
the
numerous
freethinking
books
that
appeared
in
england
in
the
eighteenth
century
this
is
the
only
one
which
is
still
a
widely
read
classic
in
what
a
lady
friend
of
johnson
called
two
offensive
xv
and
xvi
the
causes
of
the
rise
and
success
of
christianity
are
for
the
first
time
critically
investigated
as
a
simple
historical
phenomenon
like
most
freethinkers
of
the
time
gibbon
thought
it
well
to
protect
himself
and
his
work
against
the
possibility
of
prosecution
by
paying
ironical
to
the
orthodox
creed
but
even
if
there
had
been
no
such
danger
he
could
not
have
chosen
a
more
incisive
weapon
for
his
merciless
criticism
of
orthodox
opinion
than
the
irony
which
he
wielded
with
superb
ease
having
pointed
out
that
the
victory
of
christianity
is
obviously
and
satisfactorily
explained
by
the
convincing
evidence
of
the
doctrine
and
by
the
ruling
providence
of
its
great
author
he
proceeds
becoming
to
inquire
into
the
secondary
causes
he
traces
the
history
of
the
faith
up
to
the
time
of
constantine
in
such
a
way
as
clearly
to
suggest
that
the
hypothesis
of
divine
interposition
is
superfluous
and
that
we
have
to
do
with
a
purely
human
development
he
marshals
with
ironical
protests
the
obvious
objections
to
the
alleged
evidence
for
supernatural
control
he
does
not
himself
criticize
moses
and
the
prophets
but
he
reproduces
the
objections
which
were
made
against
their
authority
by
vain
science
of
the
he
notes
that
the
doctrine
of
immortality
is
omitted
in
the
law
of
moses
but
this
doubtless
was
a
mysterious
dispensation
of
providence
we
can
not
entirely
remove
imputation
of
ignorance
and
obscurity
which
has
been
so
arrogantly
cast
on
the
first
proselytes
of
christianity
but
we
must
the
occasion
of
scandal
into
a
subject
of
and
remember
that
lower
we
depress
the
temporal
condition
of
the
first
christians
the
more
reason
we
shall
find
to
admire
their
merit
and
treatment
of
miracles
from
the
purely
historical
point
of
view
he
owed
a
great
deal
to
middleton
see
above
was
particularly
disconcerting
in
the
early
age
of
christianity
laws
of
nature
were
frequently
suspended
for
the
benefit
of
the
church
but
the
sages
of
greece
and
rome
turned
aside
from
the
awful
spectacle
and
pursuing
the
ordinary
occupations
of
life
and
study
appeared
unconscious
of
any
alterations
in
the
moral
or
physical
government
of
the
world
under
the
reign
of
tiberius
the
whole
earth
or
at
least
a
celebrated
province
of
the
roman
empire
was
involved
in
a
praeternatural
darkness
of
three
hours
even
this
miraculous
event
which
ought
to
have
excited
the
wonder
the
curiosity
and
the
devotion
of
mankind
passed
without
notice
in
an
age
of
science
and
history
it
happened
during
the
lifetime
of
seneca
and
the
elder
pliny
who
must
have
experienced
the
immediate
effects
or
received
the
earliest
intelligence
of
the
prodigy
each
of
these
philosophers
in
a
laborious
work
has
recorded
all
the
great
phenomena
of
nature
earthquakes
meteors
comets
and
eclipses
which
his
indefatigable
curiosity
could
collect
both
the
one
and
the
other
have
omitted
to
mention
the
greatest
phenomenon
to
which
the
mortal
eye
has
been
witness
since
the
creation
of
the
how
we
excuse
the
supine
inattention
of
the
pagan
and
philosophic
world
to
those
evidences
which
were
presented
by
the
hand
of
omnipotence
not
to
their
reason
but
to
their
senses
again
if
every
believer
is
convinced
of
the
reality
of
miracles
every
reasonable
man
is
convinced
of
their
cessation
yet
every
age
bears
testimony
to
miracles
and
the
testimony
seems
no
less
respectable
than
that
of
the
preceding
generation
when
did
they
cease
how
was
it
that
the
generation
which
saw
the
last
genuine
miracles
performed
could
not
distinguish
them
from
the
impostures
which
followed
had
men
so
soon
forgotten
style
of
the
divine
the
inference
is
that
genuine
and
spurious
miracles
are
indistinguishable
but
the
credulity
or
of
among
early
believers
was
beneficial
to
the
cause
of
truth
and
religion
modern
times
a
latent
and
even
involuntary
scepticism
adheres
to
the
most
pious
dispositions
their
admission
of
supernatural
truths
is
much
less
an
active
consent
than
a
cold
and
passive
acquiescence
accustomed
long
since
to
observe
and
to
respect
the
invariable
order
of
nature
our
reason
or
at
least
our
imagination
is
not
sufficiently
prepared
to
sustain
the
visible
action
of
the
gibbon
had
not
the
advantage
of
the
minute
critical
labours
which
in
the
following
century
were
expended
on
his
sources
of
information
but
his
masterly
exposure
of
the
conventional
history
of
the
early
church
remains
in
many
of
its
most
important
points
perfectly
valid
i
suspect
that
his
artillery
has
produced
more
effect
on
intelligent
minds
in
subsequent
generations
than
the
archery
of
voltaire
for
his
book
became
indispensable
as
the
great
history
of
the
middle
ages
the
most
orthodox
could
not
do
without
it
and
the
poison
must
have
often
worked
we
have
seen
how
theological
controversy
in
the
first
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
had
turned
on
the
question
whether
the
revealed
religion
was
consistent
and
compatible
with
natural
religion
the
deistic
attacks
on
this
line
were
almost
exhausted
by
the
middle
of
the
century
and
the
orthodox
thought
that
they
had
been
satisfactorily
answered
but
it
was
not
enough
to
show
that
the
revelation
is
reasonable
it
was
necessary
to
prove
that
it
is
real
and
rests
on
a
solid
historical
basis
this
was
the
question
raised
in
an
acute
form
by
the
criticisms
of
hume
and
middleton
on
miracles
the
ablest
answer
was
given
by
paley
in
his
evidences
of
christianity
the
only
one
of
the
apologies
of
that
age
which
is
still
read
though
it
has
ceased
to
have
any
value
theology
illustrates
how
orthodox
opinions
are
coloured
unconsciously
by
the
spirit
of
the
time
he
proved
in
his
natural
theology
the
existence
of
god
by
the
argument
from
design
taking
any
account
of
the
criticisms
of
hume
on
that
argument
just
as
a
watchmaker
is
inferred
from
a
watch
so
a
divine
workman
is
inferred
from
contrivances
in
nature
paley
takes
his
instances
of
such
contrivance
largely
from
the
organs
and
constitution
of
the
human
body
his
idea
of
god
is
that
of
an
ingenious
contriver
dealing
with
rather
obstinate
material
leslie
stephen
remarked
been
civilized
like
man
he
has
become
scientific
and
ingenious
he
is
superior
to
watt
or
priestley
in
devising
mechanical
and
chemical
contrivances
and
is
therefore
made
in
the
image
of
that
generation
of
which
watt
and
priestley
were
conspicuous
when
a
god
of
this
kind
is
established
there
is
no
difficulty
about
miracles
and
it
is
on
miracles
that
paley
bases
the
case
for
other
arguments
are
subsidiary
and
his
proof
of
the
new
testament
miracles
is
that
the
apostles
who
were
believed
in
them
for
otherwise
they
would
not
have
acted
and
suffered
in
the
cause
of
their

it
may
be
taken
as
the
thermometer
for
freedom
of
thought
in
general
at
this
period
it
was
as
dangerous
to
publish
revolutionary
opinions
in
politics
as
in
theology

enthusiastic
admirer
of

american

supporter
of

indictment

he
soon
committed
a
new
offence
by
the
publication
of
an
work
the
age
of
reason
and
which
he
began
to
write
in
the
paris
prison
into
which
he
had
been
thrown
by
robespierre
this
book
is
remarkable
as
the
first
important
english
publication
in
which
the
christian
scheme
of
salvation
and
the
bible
are
assailed
in
plain
language
without
any
disguise
or
reserve
in
the
second
place
it
was
written
in
such
a
way
as
to
reach
the
masses
and
thirdly
while
the
criticisms
on
the
bible
are
in
the
same
vein
as
those
of
the
earlier
deists
paine
is
the
first
to
present
with
force
the
incongruity
of
the
christian
scheme
with
the
conception
of
the
universe
attained
by
astronomical
science
it
is
not
a
direct
article
of
the
christian
system
that
this
world
that
we
inhabit
is
the
whole
of
the
inhabitable
globe
yet
it
is
so
worked
up
what
is
called
the
mosaic
account
of
the
creation
the
story
of
eve
and
the
apple
and
the
counterpart
of
that
story
the
death
of
the
son
of
to
believe
otherwise
that
is
to
believe
that
god
created
a
plurality
of
worlds
at
least
as
numerous
as
what
we
call
stars
renders
the
christian
system
of
faith
at
once
little
and
ridiculous
and
scatters
it
in
the
mind
like
feathers
in
the
air
the
two
beliefs
can
not
be
held
together
in
the
same
mind
and
he
who
thinks
that
he
believes
both
has
thought
but
little
of
as
an
ardent
deist
who
regarded
nature
as
revelation
paine
was
able
to
press
this
argument
with
particular
force
referring
to
some
of
the
tales
in
the
old
testament
he
says
we
contemplate
the
immensity
of
that
being
who
directs
and
governs
the
incomprehensible
whole
of
which
the
utmost
ken
of
human
sight
can
discover
but
a
part
we
ought
to
feel
shame
at
calling
such
paltry
stories
the
word
of
the
book
drew
a
reply
from
bishop
watson
one
of
those
admirable
divines
who
admitted
the
right
of
private
judgment
and
thought
that
argument
should
be
met
by
argument
and
not
by
force
his
reply
had
the
rather
significant
title
an
apology
for
the
bible
george
iii
remarked
that
he
was
not
aware
that
any
apology
was
needed
for
that
book
it
is
a
weak
defence
but
is
remarkable
for
the
concessions
which
it
makes
to
several
of
criticisms
of
which
were
calculated
to
damage
the
doctrine
of
the
infallibility
of
the
bible
it
was
doubtless
in
consequence
of
the
enormous
circulation
of
the
age
of
reason
that
a
society
for
the
suppression
of
vice
decided
to
prosecute
the
publisher
unbelief
was
common
among
the
ruling
class
but
the
view
was
firmly
held
that
religion
was
necessary
for
the
populace
and
that
any
attempt
to
disseminate
unbelief
among
the
lower
classes
must
be
suppressed
religion
was
regarded
as
a
valuable
instrument
to
keep
the
poor
in
order
it
is
notable
that
of
the
earlier
rationalists
apart
from
the
case
of
woolston
the
only
one
who
was
punished
was
peter
annet
a
schoolmaster
who
tried
to
popularize
freethought
and
was
sentenced
for
diffusing
opinions
to
the
pillory
and
hard
labour
paine
held
that
the
people
at
large
had
the
right
of
access
to
all
new
ideas
and
he
wrote
so
as
to
reach
the
people
hence
his
book
must
be
suppressed
at
the
trial
the
judge
placed
every
obstacle
in
the
way
of
the
defence
the
publisher
was
sentenced
to
a
imprisonment
this
was
not
the
end
of
paine
prosecutions
in
a
third
part
of
the
age
of
reason
appeared
and
eaton
the
publisher
was
condemned
to
eighteen
imprisonment
and
to
stand
in
the
pillory
once
a
month
the
judge
lord
ellenborough
said
in
his
charge
that

banished

of
frederick
under
whose
tolerant
rule
prussia
was
an
asylum
for
those
writers
who
suffered
for
their
opinions
in
neighbouring
states
frederick
indeed
held
the
view
which
was
held
by
so
many
english
rationalists
of
the
time
and
is
still
held
widely
enough
that
freethought
is
not
desirable
for
the
multitude
because
they
are
incapable
of
understanding

germany
felt
the
influence
of
the
english
deists
of
the
french
freethinkers
and
of
spinoza
but
in
the
german
rationalistic
propaganda
of
this
period
there
is
nothing
very
original
or
interesting
the
names
of
edelmann
and
bahrdt
may
be
mentioned
the
works
of
edelmann
who
attacked
the
inspiration
of
the
bible
were
burned
in
various
cities
and
he
was
forced
to
seek
protection
at
berlin
bahrdt
was
more
aggressive
than
any
other
writer
of
the
time
originally
a
preacher
it
was
by
slow
degrees
that
he
moved
away
from
the
orthodox
faith
his
translation
of
the
new
testament
cut
short
his
ecclesiastical
career
his
last
years
were
spent
as
an
his
writings
for
instance
his
popular
letters
on
the
bible
must
have
had
a
considerable
effect
if
we
may
judge
by
the
hatred
which
he
excited
among
theologians
it
was
not
however
in
direct
rationalistic
propaganda
but
in
literature
and
philosophy
that
the
german
enlightenment
of
this
century
expressed
itself
the
most
illustrious

of

goethe
who
was
profoundly
influenced
by
spinoza
and

effect
of
their

and
of
the
whole
literary
movement
of

time
made
for
the
freest
treatment
of
human
experience
one
german
thinker
shook
the
philosopher
kant
his
critic
of
pure
reason
demonstrated
that
when
we
attempt
to
prove
by
the
fight
of
the
intellect
the
existence
of
god
and
the
immortality
of
the
soul
we
fall
helplessly
into
contradictions
his
destructive
criticism
of
the
argument
from
design
and
all
natural
theology
was
more
complete
than
that
of
hume
and
his
philosophy
different
though
his
system
was
issued
in
the
same
practical
result
as
that
of
locke
to
confine
knowledge
to
experience
it
is
true
that
afterwards
in
the
interest
of
ethics
he
tried
to
smuggle
in
by
a
the
deity
whom
he
had
turned
out
by
the
front
gate
but
the
attempt
was
not
a
success
his
it
led
to
new
speculative
systems
in
which
the
name
of
god
was
used
to
mean
something
very
different
from
the
deistic
a
significant
step
further

the
deliverance
of
reason

modern

heralded
by
the
researches
of
copernicus
was
founded
in
the
seventeenth
century
which
saw
the
demonstration
of
the
copernican
theory
the
discovery
of

the
discovery
of
the
circulation
of
the

and
the
foundation
of

and
physics
the
true
nature
of
comets
was
ascertained
and
they
ceased
to
be
regarded
as
signs
of
heavenly
wrath
but
several
generations
were
to
pass
before
science
became
in
protestant
countries
an
involuntary
of
theology
till
the
nineteenth
century
it
was
only
in
minor
points
such
as
the
movement
of
the
earth
that
proved
scientific
facts
seemed
to
conflict
with
scripture
and
it
was
easy
enough
to
explain
away
these
inconsistencies
by
a
new
interpretation
of
the
sacred
texts
yet
remarkable
facts
were
accumulating
which
though
not
explained
by
science
seemed
to
menace
the
credibility
of
biblical
history
if
the
story
of
ark
and
the
flood
is
true
how
was
it
that
beasts
unable
to
swim
or
fly
inhabit
america
and
the
islands
of
the
ocean
and
what
about
the
new
species
which
were
constantly
being
found
in
the
new

and
did
not
exist
in
the
old
where
did
the
kangaroos
of

drop
from
the
only
explanation
compatible
with
received
theology
seemed
to
be
the
hypothesis
of
innumerable
new
acts
of
creation
later
than
the
flood
it
was
in
the
field
of
natural
history
that
scientific
men
of
the
eighteenth
century
suffered
most
from
the
coercion
of
authority
linnaeus
felt
it
in
sweden
buffon
in
france
buffon
was
compelled
to
retract
hypotheses
which
he
put
forward
about
the
formation
of
the
earth
in
his
natural
history
and
to
state
that
he
believed
implicitly
in
the
bible
account
of
creation
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
laplace
worked
out
the
mechanics
of
the
universe
on
the
nebular
hypothesis
his
results
dispensed
as
he
said
to
napoleon
with
the
hypothesis
of
god
and
were
duly
denounced
his
theory
involved
a
long
physical
process
before
the
earth
and
solar
system
came
to
be
formed
but
this
was
not
fatal
for
a
little
ingenuity
might
preserve
the
credit
of
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
geology
was
to
prove
a
more
formidable
enemy
to
the
biblical
story
of
the
creation
and
the
deluge
the
theory
of
a
french
naturalist
cuvier
that
the
earth
had
repeatedly
experienced
catastrophes
each
of
which
necessitated
a
new
creative
act
helped
for
a
time
to
save
the
belief
in
divine
intervention
and
lyell
in
his
principles
of
geology
while
he
undermined
the
assumption
of
catastrophes
by
showing
that
the
history
could
be
explained
by
the
ordinary
processes
which
we
still
see
in
operation
yet
held
fast
to
successive
acts
of
creation
it
was
not
till
that
he
presented
fully
in
his
antiquity
of
man
the
evidence
which
showed
that
the
human
race
had
inhabited
the
earth
for
a
far
longer
period
than
could
be
reconciled
with
the
record
of
scripture
that
record
might
be
adapted
to
the
results
of
science
in
regard
not
only
to
the
earth
itself
but
also
to
the
plants
and
lower
animals
by
explaining
the
word
in
the
jewish
story
of
creation
to
signify
some
long
period
of
time
but
this
way
out
was
impossible
in
the
case
of
the
creation
of
man
for
the
sacred
chronology
is
quite
definite
an
english
divine
of
the
seventeenth
century
ingeniously
calculated
that
man
was
created
by
the
trinity
on
october
at
in
the
morning
and
no
reckoning
of
the
bible
dates
could
put
the
event
much
further
back
other
evidence
reinforced
the
conclusions
from
geology
but
geology
alone
was
sufficient
to
damage
irretrievably
the
historical
truth
of
the
jewish
legend
of
creation
the
only
means
of
rescuing
it
was
to
suppose
that
god
had
created
misleading
evidence
for
the
express
purpose
of
deceiving
man
geology
shook
the
infallibility
of
the
bible
but
left
the
creation
of
some
prehistoric
adam
and
eve
a
still
admissible
hypothesis
here
however
zoology
stepped
in
and
pronounced
upon
the
origin
of
man
it
was
an
old
conjecture
that
the
higher
forms
of
life
including
man
had
developed
out
of
lower
forms
and
advanced
thinkers
had
been
reaching
the
conclusion
that
the
universe
as
we
find
it
is
the
result
of
a
continuous
process
unbroken
by
supernatural
interference
and
explicable
by
uniform
natural
laws
but
while
the
reign
of
law
in
the
world
of
matter
seemed
to
be
established
the
world
of
life
could
be
considered
a
field
in
which
the
theory
of
divine
intervention
is
perfectly
valid
so
long
as
science
failed
to
assign
satisfactory
causes
for
the
origination
of
the
various
kinds
of
animals
and
plants
the
publication
of
origin
of
species
in
is
therefore
a
landmark
not
only
in
science
but
in
the
war
between
science
and
theology
when
this
book
appeared
bishop
wilberforce
truly
said
that
principle
of
natural
selection
is
incompatible
with
the
word
of
god
and
theologians
in
germany
and
france
as
well
as
in
england
cried
aloud
against
the
threatened
dethronement
of
the
deity
the
appearance
of
the
descent
of
man
in
which
the
evidence
for
the
pedigree
of
the
human
race
from
lower
animals
was
marshalled
with
masterly
force
renewed
the
outcry
the
bible
said
that
god
created
man
in
his
own
image
darwin
said
that
man
descended
from
an
ape
the
feelings
of
the
orthodox
world
may
be
expressed
in
the
words
of
gladstone
the
grounds
of
what
is
called
evolution
god
is
relieved
of
the
labour
of
creation
and
in
the
name
of
unchangeable
laws
is
discharged
from
governing
the
it
was
a
discharge
which
as
spencer
observed
had
begun
with
discovery
of
gravitation
if
darwin
did
not
as
is
now
recognized
supply
a
complete
explanation
of
the
origin
of
species
his
researches
shattered
the
supernatural
theory
and
confirmed
the
view
to
which
many
able
thinkers
had
been
led
that
development
is
continuous
in
the
living
as
in
the
world
another
nail
was
driven
into
the
coffin
of
creation
and
the
fall
of
adam
and
the
doctrine
of
redemption
could
only
be
rescued
by
making
it
independent
of
the
jewish
fable
on
which
it
was
founded
darwinism
as
it
is
called
has
had
the
larger
effect
of
discrediting
the
theory
of
the
adaptation
of
means
to
ends
in
nature
by
an
external
and
infinitely
powerful
intelligence
the
inadequacy
of
the
argument
from
design
as
a
proof
of
existence
had
been
shown
by
the
logic
of
hume
and
kant
but
the
observation
of
the
of
nature
shows
that
the
very
analogy
between
nature
and
art
on
which
the
argument
depends
breaks
down
the
impropriety
of
the
analogy
has
been
pointed
out
in
a
telling
way
by
a
german
writer
lange
if
a
man
wants
to
shoot
a
hare
which
is
in
a
certain
field
he
does
not
procure
thousands
of
guns
surround
the
field
and
cause
them
all
to
be
fired
off
or
if
he
wants
a
house
to
live
in
he
does
not
build
a
whole
town
and
abandon
to
weather
and
decay
all
the
houses
but
one
if
he
did
either
of
these
things
we
should
say
he
was
mad
or
amazingly
unintelligent
his
actions
certainly
would
not
be
held
to
indicate
a
powerful
mind
expert
in
adapting
means
to
ends
but
these
are
the
sort
of
things
that
nature
does
her
wastefulness
in
the
propagation
of
life
is
reckless
for
the
production
of
one
life
she
sacrifices
innumerable
germs
the
is
achieved
in
one
case
out
of
thousands
the
rule
is
destruction
and
failure
if
intelligence
had
anything
to
do
with
this
bungling
process
it
would
be
an
intelligence
infinitely
low
and
the
finished
product
if
regarded
as
a
work
of
design
points
to
incompetence
in
the
designer
take
the
human
eye
an
illustrious
man
of
science
helmholtz
said
an
optician
sent
it
to
me
as
an
instrument
i
should
send
it
back
with
reproaches
for
the
carelessness
of
his
work
and
demand
the
return
of
my
money
darwin
showed
how
the
phenomena
might
be
explained
as
events
not
brought
about
intentionally
but
due
to
exceptional
concurrences
of
circumstances
the
phenomena
of
nature
are
a
system
of
things
which
and
follow
each
other
according
to
invariable
laws
this
deadly
proposition
was
asserted
early
in
the
nineteenth
century
to
be
an
axiom
of
science
it
was
formulated
by
mill
in
his
system
of
logic
as
the
foundation
on
which
scientific
induction
rests
it
means
that
at
any
moment
the
state
of
the
whole
universe
is
the
effect
of
its
state
at
the
preceding
moment
the
casual
sequence
between
two
successive
states
is
not
broken
by
any
arbitrary
interference
suppressing
or
altering
the
relation
between
cause
and
effect
some
ancient
greek
philosophers
were
convinced
of
this
principle
the
work
done
by
modern
science
in
every
field
seems
to
be
a
verification
of
it
but
it
need
not
be
stated
in
such
an
absolute
form
recently
scientific
men
have
been
inclined
to
express
the
axiom
with
more
reserve
and
less
dogmatically
they
are
prepared
to
recognize
that
it
is
simply
a
postulate
without
which
the
scientific
comprehension
of
the
universe
would
be
impossible
and
they
are
inclined
to
state
it
not
as
a
law
of
the
idea
of
causation
leads
into
rather
as
uniformity
of
experience
but
they
are
not
readier
to
admit
exceptions
to
this
uniformity
than
their
predecessors
were
to
admit
exceptions
to
the
law
of
causation
the
idea
of
development
has
been
applied
not
only
to
nature
but
to
the
mind
of
man
and
to
the
history
of
civilization
including
thought
and
religion
the
first
who
attempted
to
apply
this
idea
methodically
to
the
whole
universe
was
not
a
student
of
natural
science
but
a
metaphysician
hegel
his
extremely
difficult
philosophy
had
such
a
wide
influence
on
thought
that
a
few
words
must
be
said
about
its
tendency
he
conceived
the
whole
of
existence
as
what
he
called
the
absolute
idea
which
is
not
in
space
or
time
and
is
compelled
by
the
laws
of
its
being
to
manifest
itself
in
the
process
of
the
world
first
externalizing
itself
in
nature
and
then
becoming
conscious
of
itself
as
spirit
in
individual
minds
his
system
is
hence
called
absolute
idealism
the
attraction
which
it
exercised
has
probably
been
in
great
measure
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
in
harmony
with
thought
in
so
far
as
it
conceived
the
process
of
the
world
both
in
nature
and
spirit
as
a
necessary
development
from
lower
to
higher
stages
in
this
respect
indeed
vision
was
limited
he
treats
the
process
as
if
it
were
practically
complete
already
and
does
not
take
into
account
the
probability
of
further
development
in
the
future
to
which
other
thinkers
of
his
own
time
were
turning
their
attention
but
what
concerns
us
here
is
that
while
system
is
finding
the
explanation
of
the
universe
in
thought
and
not
in
matter
it
tended
as
powerfully
as
any
materialistic
system
to
subvert
orthodox
beliefs
it
is
true
that
some
have
claimed
it
as
supporting
christianity
a
certain
colour
is
lent
to
this
by
view
that
the
christian
creed
as
the
highest
religion
contains
doctrines
which
express
imperfectly
some
of
the
ideas
of
the
highest
own
along
with
the
fact
that
he
sometimes
speaks
of
the
absolute
idea
as
if
it
were
a
person
though
personality
would
be
a
limitation
inconsistent
with
his
conception
of
it
but
it
is
sufficient
to
observe
that
whatever
value
be
assigned
to
christianity
he
regarded
it
from
the
superior
standpoint
of
a
purely
intellectual
philosophy
not
as
a
special
revelation
of
truth
but
as
a
certain
approximation
to
the
truth
which
philosophy
alone
can
reach
and
it
may
be
said
with
some
confidence
that
any
one
who
comes
under
spell
feels
that
he
is
in
possession
of
a
theory
of
the
universe
which
relieves
him
from
the
need
or
desire
of
any
revealed
religion
his
influence
in
germany
russia
and
elsewhere
has
entirely
made
for
highly
unorthodox
thought
hegel
was
not
aggressive
he
was
superior
his
french
contemporary
comte
who
also
thought
out
a
comprehensive
system
aggressively
and
explicitly
rejected
theology
as
an
obsolete
way
of
explaining
the
universe
he
rejected
metaphysics
likewise
and
all
that
hegel
stood
for
as
equally
useless
on
the
ground
that
metaphysicians
explain
nothing
but
merely
describe
phenomena
in
abstract
terms
and
that
questions
about
the
origin
of
the
world
and
why
it
exists
are
quite
beyond
the
reach
of
reason
both
theology
and
metaphysics
are
superseded
by
investigation
of
causes
and
effects
and
coexistences
and
the
future
progress
of
society
will
be
guided
by
the
scientific
view
of
the
world
which
confines
itself
to
the
positive
data
of
experience
comte
was
convinced
that
religion
is
a
social
necessity
and
to
supply
the
place
of
the
theological
religions
which
he
pronounced
to
be
doomed
he
invented
a
new
religion
of
humanity
it
differs
from
the
great
religions
of
the
world
in
having
no
supernatural
or
articles
of
belief
and
on
that
account
he
had
few
adherents
but
the
of
comte
has
exercised
great
influence
not
least
in
england
where
its
principles
have
been
promulgated
especially
by
frederic
harrison
who
in
the
latter
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
has
been
one
of
the
most
indefatigable
workers
in
the
cause
of
reason
against
authority
another
comprehensive
system
was
worked
out
by
an
englishman
herbert
spencer
like
it
was
based
on
science
and
attempts
to
show
how
starting
with
a
nebular
universe
the
whole
knowable
world
psychical
and
social
as
well
as
physical
can
be
deduced
his
synthetic
philosophy
perhaps
did
more
than
anything
else
to
make
the
idea
of
evolution
familiar
in
england
i
must
mention
one
other
modern
explanation
of
the
world
that
of
haeckel
the
zoologist
professor
at
jena
who
may
be
called
the
prophet
of
evolution
his
creation
of
man
covered
the
same
ground
as
descent
had
an
enormous
circulation
and
was
translated
i
believe
into
fourteen
languages
his
enjoys
the
same
popularity
he
has
taught
like
spencer
that
the
principle
of
evolution
applies
not
only
to
the
history
of
nature
but
also
to
human
civilization
and
human
thought
he
differs
from
spencer
and
comte
in
not
assuming
any
unknowable
reality
behind
natural
phenomena
his
adversaries
commonly
stigmatize
his
theory
as
materialism
but
this
is
a
mistake
like
spinoza
he
recognizes
matter
and
mind
body
and
thought
as
two
inseparable
sides
of
ultimate
reality
which
he
calls
god
in
fact
he
identifies
his
philosophy
with
that
of
spinoza
and
he
logically
proceeds
to
conceive
material
atoms
as
thinking
his
idea
of
the
physical
world
is
based
on
the
old
mechanical
conception
of
matter
which
in
recent
years
has
been
discredited
but
monism
as
he
called
his
doctrine
has
lately
been
reshaped
and
in
its
new
form
promises
to
exercise
wide
influence
on
thoughtful
people
in
germany
i
will
return
later
to
this
monistic
movement
it
had
been
a
fundamental
principle
of
comte
that
human
actions
and
human
history
are
as
strictly
subject
as
nature
is
to
the
law
of
causation
two
psychological
works
appeared
in
england
in
senses
and
intellect
and
principles
of
psychology
which
taught
that
our
volitions
are
completely
determined
being
the
inevitable
consequences
of
chains
of
causes
and
effects
but
a
far
deeper
impression
was
produced
two
years
later
by
the
first
volume
of
history
of
civilization
in
england
a
work
of
much
less
permanent
value
which
attempted
to
apply
this
principle
to
history
men
act
in
consequence
of
motives
their
motives
are
the
results
of
preceding
facts
so
that
we
were
acquainted
with
the
whole
of
the
antecedents
and
with
all
the
laws
of
their
movements
we
could
with
unerring
certainty
predict
the
whole
of
their
immediate
thus
history
is
an
unbroken
chain
of
causes
and
effects
chance
is
excluded
it
is
a
mere
name
for
the
defects
of
our
knowledge
mysterious
and
providential
interference
is
excluded
buckle
maintained
existence
but
eliminated
him
from
history
and
his
book
dealt
a
resounding
blow
at
the
theory
that
human
actions
are
not
submitted
to
the
law
of
universal
causation
the
science
of
anthropology
has
in
recent
years
aroused
wide
interest
inquiries
into
the
condition
of
early
man
have
shown
independently
of
darwinism
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
for
the
view
that
he
fell
from
a
higher
to
a
lower
state
the
evidence
points
to
a
slow
rise
from
mere
animality
the
origin
of
religious
beliefs
has
been
investigated
with
results
disquieting
for
orthodoxy
the
researches
of
students
of
anthropology
and
comparative
as
tylor
robertson
smith
and
gone
to
show
that
mysterious
ideas
and
dogma
and
rites
which
were
held
to
be
peculiar
to
the
christian
revelation
are
derived
from
the
crude
ideas
of
primitive
religions
that
the
mystery
of
the
eucharist
comes
from
the
common
savage
rite
of
eating
a
dead
god
that
the
death
and
resurrection
of
a
god
in
human
form
which
form
the
central
fact
of
christianity
and
the
miraculous
birth
of
a
saviour
are
features
which
it
has
in
common
with
pagan
conclusions
are
supremely
unedifying
it
may
be
said
that
in
themselves
they
are
not
fatal
to
the
claims
of
the
current
theology
it
may
be
held
for
instance
that
as
part
of
christian
revelation
such
ideas
acquired
a
new
significance
and
that
god
wisely
availed
himself
of
familiar
though
false
and
leading
to
cruel
practices
he
himself
had
inspired
and
order
to
construct
a
scheme
of
redemption
which
should
appeal
to
the
prejudices
of
man
some
minds
may
find
satisfaction
in
this
sort
of
explanation
but
it
may
be
suspected
that
most
of
the
few
who
study
modern
researches
into
the
origin
of
religious
beliefs
will
feel
the
lines
which
were
supposed
to
mark
off
the
christian
from
all
other
faiths
dissolving
before
their
eyes
the
general
result
of
the
advance
of
science
including
anthropology
has
been
to
create
a
coherent
view
of
the
world
in
which
the
christian
scheme
based
on
the
notions
of
an
unscientific
age
and
on
the
arrogant
assumption
that
the
universe
was
made
for
man
has
no
suitable
or
reasonable
place
if
paine
felt
this
a
hundred
years
ago
it
is
far
more
apparent
now
all
minds
however
are
not
equally
impressed
with
this
incongruity
there
are
many
who
will
admit
the
proofs
furnished
by
science
that
the
biblical
record
as
to
the
antiquity
of
man
is
false
but
are
not
affected
by
the
incongruity
between
the
scientific
and
theological
conceptions
of
the
world
for
such
minds
science
has
only
succeeded
in
carrying
some
entrenchments
which
may
be
abandoned
without
much
harm
it
has
made
the
old
orthodox
view
of
the
infallibility
of
the
bible
untenable
and
upset
the
doctrine
of
the
creation
and
fall
but
it
would
still
be
possible
for
christianity
to
maintain
the
supernatural
claim
by
modifying
its
theory
of
the
authority
of
the
bible
and
revising
its
theory
of
redemption
if
the
evidence
of
natural
science
were
the
only
group
of
facts
with
which
it
collided
it
might
be
argued
that
the
law
of
universal
causation
is
a
hypothesis
inferred
from
experience
but
that
experience
includes
the
testimonies
of
history
and
must
therefore
take
account
of
the
clear
evidence
of
miraculous
occurrences
in
the
new
testament
evidence
which
is
valid
even
if
that
book
was
not
inspired
thus
a
stand
could
be
taken
against
the
generalization
of
science
on
the
firm
ground
of
historical
fact
that
solid
ground
however
has
given
way
undermined
by
historical
criticism
which
has
been
more
deadly
than
the
criticism
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
methodical
examination
of
the
records
contained
in
the
bible
dealing
with
them
as
if
they
were
purely
human
documents
is
the
work
of
the
nineteenth
century
something
indeed
had
already
been
done
spinoza
for
instance
above
and
simon
a
frenchman
whose
books
were
burnt
were
pioneers
and
the
modern
criticism
of
the
old
testament
was
begun
by
astruc
professor
of
medicine
at
paris
who
discovered
an
important
clue
for
distinguishing
different
documents
used
by
the
compiler
of
the
book
of
genesis
his
german
contemporary
reimarus
a
student
of
the
new
testament
anticipated
the
modern
conclusion
that
jesus
had
no
intention
of
founding
a
new
religion
and
saw
that
the
gospel
of
john
presents
a
different
figure
from
the
jesus
of
the
other
evangelists
but
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
methods
of
criticism
applied
by
german
scholars
to
homer
and
to
the
records
of
early
roman
history
were
extended
to
the
investigation
of
the
bible
the
work
has
been
done
principally
in
germany
the
old
tradition
that
the
pentateuch
was
written
by
moses
has
been
completely
discredited
it
is
now
agreed
unanimously
by
all
who
have
studied
the
facts
that
the
pentateuch
was
put
together
from
a
number
of
different
documents
of
different
ages
the
earliest
dating
from
the
ninth
the
last
from
the
fifth
century
and
there
are
later
minor
additions
an
important
though
undesigned
contribution
was
made
to
this
exposure
by
an
englishman
colenso
bishop
of
natal
it
had
been
held
that
the
oldest
of
the
documents
which
had
been
distinguished
was
a
narrative
which
begins
in
genesis
chapter
i
but
there
was
the
difficulty
that
this
narrative
seemed
to
be
closely
associated
with
the
legislation
of
leviticus
which
could
be
proved
to
belong
to
the
fifth
century
in
colenso
published
the
first
part
of
his
pentateuch
and
the
book
of
joshua
critically
examined
his
doubts
of
the
truth
of
old
testament
history
had
been
awakened
by
a
converted
zulu
who
asked
the
intelligent
question
whether
he
could
really
believe
in
the
story
of
the
flood
all
the
beasts
and
birds
and
creeping
things
upon
the
earth
large
and
small
from
hot
countries
and
cold
came
thus
by
pairs
and
entered
into
the
ark
with
noah
and
did
noah
gather
food
for
them
all
for
the
beasts
and
birds
of
prey
as
well
as
the
rest
the
bishop
then
proceeded
to
test
the
accuracy
of
the
inspired
books
by
examining
the
numerical
statements
which
they
contain
the
results
were
fatal
to
them
as
historical
records
quite
apart
from
miracles
the
possibility
of
which
he
did
not
question
he
showed
that
the
whole
story
of
the
sojourn
of
the
israelites
in
egypt
and
the
wilderness
was
full
of
absurdities
and
impossibilities
book
raised
a
storm
of
indignation
in
was
known
as
wicked
but
on
the
continent
its
reception
was
very
different
the
portions
of
the
pentateuch
and
joshua
which
he
proved
to
be
unhistorical
belonged
precisely
to
the
narrative
which
had
caused
perplexity
and
critics
were
led
by
his
results
to
conclude
that
like
the
levitical
laws
with
which
it
was
connected
it
was
as
late
as
the
fifth
century
one
of
the
most
striking
results
of
the
researches
on
the
old
testament
has
been
that
the
jews
themselves
handled
their
traditions
freely
each
of
the
successive
documents
which
were
afterwards
woven
together
was
written
by
men
who
adopted
a
perfectly
free
attitude
towards
the
older
traditions
and
having
no
suspicion
that
they
were
of
divine
origin
did
not
bow
down
before
their
authority
it
was
reserved
for
the
christians
to
invest
with
infallible
authority
the
whole
indiscriminate
lump
of
these
jewish
documents
inconsistent
not
only
in
their
tendencies
since
they
reflect
the
spirit
of
different
ages
but
also
in
some
respects
in
substance
the
examination
of
most
of
the
other
old
testament
books
has
led
to
conclusions
likewise
adverse
to
the
orthodox
view
of
their
origin
and
character
new
knowledge
on
many
points
has
been
derived
from
the
babylonian
literature
which
has
been
recovered
during
the
last
half
century
one
of
the
earliest
and
most
sensational
discoveries
was
that
the
jews
got
their
story
of
the
flood
from
babylonian
mythology
modern
criticism
of
the
new
testament
began
with
the
stimulating
works
of
baur
and
of
strauss
whose
life
of
jesus
in
which
the
supernatural
was
entirely
rejected
had
an
immense
success
and
caused
furious
controversy
both
these
rationalists
were
influenced
by
hegel
at
the
same
time
a
classical
scholar
lachmann
laid
the
foundations
of
the
criticism
of
the
greek
text
of
the
new
testament
by
issuing
the
first
scientific
edition
since
then
seventy
years
of
work
have
led
to
some
certain
results
which
are
generally
accepted
in
the
first
place
no
intelligent
person
who
has
studied
modern
criticism
holds
the
old
view
that
each
of
the
four
biographies
of
jesus
is
an
independent
work
and
an
independent
testimony
to
the
facts
which
are
related
it
is
acknowledged
that
those
portions
which
are
common
to
more
than
one
and
are
written
in
identical
language
have
the
same
origin
and
represent
only
one
testimony
in
the
second
place
it
is
allowed
that
the
first
gospel
is
not
the
oldest
and
that
the
apostle
matthew
was
not
its
author
there
is
also
a
pretty
general
agreement
that
book
is
the
oldest
the
authorship
of
the
fourth
gospel
which
like
the
first
was
supposed
to
have
been
written
by
an
is
still
contested
but
even
those
who
adhere
to
the
tradition
admit
that
it
represents
a
theory
about
jesus
which
is
widely
different
from
the
view
of
the
three
other
biographers
the
result
is
that
it
can
no
longer
be
said
that
for
the
life
of
jesus
there
is
the
evidence
of
the
oldest
account
mark
was
composed
at
the
earliest
some
thirty
years
after
the
crucifixion
if
such
evidence
is
considered
good
enough
to
establish
the
supernatural
events
described
in
that
document
there
are
few
alleged
supernatural
occurrences
which
we
shall
not
be
equally
entitled
to
believe
as
a
matter
of
fact
an
interval
of
thirty
years
makes
little
difference
for
we
know
that
legends
require
little
time
to
grow
in
the
east
you
will
hear
of
miracles
which
happened
the
day
before
yesterday
the
birth
of
religions
is
always
enveloped
in
legend
and
the
miraculous
thing
would
be
as
salomon
reinach
has
observed
if
the
story
of
the
birth
of
christianity
were
pure
history
another
disturbing
result
of
unprejudiced
examination
of
the
first
three
gospels
is
that
if
you
take
the
recorded
words
of
jesus
to
be
genuine
tradition
he
had
no
idea
of
founding
a
new
religion
and
he
was
fully
persuaded
that
the
end
of
the
world
was
at
hand
at
present
the
chief
problem
of
advanced
criticism
seems
to
be
whether
his
entire
teaching
was
not
determined
by
this
delusive
conviction
it
may
be
said
that
the
advance
of
knowledge
has
thrown
no
light
on
one
of
the
most
important
beliefs
that
we
are
asked
to
accept
on
authority
the
doctrine
of
immortality
physiology
and
psychology
have
indeed
emphasized
the
difficulties
of
conceiving
a
thinking
mind
without
a
nervous
system
some
are
sanguine
enough
to
think
that
by
scientific
examination
of
psychical
phenomena
we
may
possibly
come
to
know
whether
the
of
dead
people
exist
if
the
existence
of
such
a
world
of
spirits
were
ever
established
it
would
possibly
be
the
greatest
blow
ever
sustained
by
christianity
for
the
great
appeal
of
this
and
of
some
other
religions
lies
in
the
promise
of
a
future
life
of
which
otherwise
we
should
have
no
knowledge
if
existence
after
death
were
proved
and
became
a
scientific
fact
like
the
law
of
gravitation
a
revealed
religion
might
lose
its
power
for
the
whole
point
of
a
revealed
religion
is
that
it
is
not
based
on
scientific
facts
so
far
as
i
know
those
who
are
convinced
by
spiritualistic
experiments
that
they
have
actual
converse
with
spirits
of
the
dead
and
for
whom
this
converse
however
delusive
the
evidence
may
be
is
a
fact
proved
by
experience
cease
to
feel
any
interest
in
religion
they
possess
knowledge
and
can
dispense
with
faith
the
havoc
which
science
and
historical
criticism
have
wrought
among
orthodox
beliefs
during
the
last
hundred
years
was
not
tamely
submitted
to
and
controversy
was
not
the
only
weapon
employed
strauss
was
deprived
of
his
professorship
at
tübingen
and
his
career
was
ruined
renan
whose
sensational
life
of
jesus
also
rejected
the
supernatural
lost
his
chair
in
the
collège
de
france
büchner
was
driven
from
tübingen
for
his
book
on
force
and
matter
which
appealing
to
the
general
public
set
forth
the
futility
of
supernatural
explanations
of
the
universe
an
attempt
was
made
to
chase
haeckel
from
jena
in
recent
years
a
french
catholic
the
abbé
loisy
has
made
notable
contributions
to
the
study
of
the
new
testament
and
he
was
rewarded
by
major
excommunication
in
loisy
is
the
most
prominent
figure
in
a
growing
movement
within
the
catholic
church
known
as
movement
which
some
think
is
the
gravest
crisis
in
the
history
of
the
church
since
the
thirteenth
century
the
modernists
do
not
form
an
organized
party
they
have
no
programme
they
are
devoted
to
the
church
to
its
traditions
and
associations
but
they
look
on
christianity
as
a
religion
which
has
developed
and
whose
vitality
depends
upon
its
continuing
to
develop
they
are
bent
on
reinterpreting
the
dogmas
in
the
light
of
modern
science
and
criticism
the
idea
of
development
had
already
been
applied
by
cardinal
newman
to
catholic
theology
he
taught
that
it
was
a
natural
and
therefore
legitimate
development
of
the
primitive
creed
but
he
did
not
draw
the
conclusion
which
the
modernists
draw
that
if
catholicism
is
not
to
lose
its
power
of
growth
and
die
it
must
assimilate
some
of
the
results
of
modern
thought
this
is
what
they
are
attempting
to
do
for
it
pope
pius
x
has
made
every
effort
to
suppress
the
modernists
in
july
he
issued
a
decree
denouncing
various
results
of
modern
biblical
criticism
which
are
defended
in
works
the
two
fundamental
propositions
that
organic
constitution
of
the
church
is
not
immutable
but
that
christian
society
is
subject
like
every
human
society
to
a
perpetual
evolution
and
that
dogmas
which
the
church
regards
as
revealed
are
not
fallen
from
heaven
but
are
an
interpretation
of
religious
facts
at
which
the
human
mind
laboriously
of
which
might
be
deduced
from
condemned
three
months
later
the
pope
issued
a
long
encyclical
letter
containing
an
elaborate
study
of
modernist
opinions
and
ordaining
various
measures
for
stamping
out
the
evil
no
modernist
would
admit
that
this
document
represents
his
views
fairly
yet
some
of
the
remarks
seem
very
much
to
the
point
take
one
of
their
books
page
might
be
signed
by
a
catholic
turn
over
and
you
think
you
are
reading
the
work
of
a
rationalist
in
writing
history
they
make
no
mention
of
divinity
in
the
pulpit
they
proclaim
it
a
plain
man
may
be
puzzled
by
these
attempts
to
retain
the
letter
of
old
dogmas
emptied
of
their
old
meaning
and
may
think
it
natural
enough
that
the
head
of
the
catholic
church
should
take
a
clear
and
definite
stand
against
the
new
learning
which
seems
fatal
to
its
fundamental
doctrines
for
many
years
past
liberal
divines
in
the
protestant
churches
have
been
doing
what
the
modernists
are
doing
the
phrase
of
is
used
but
is
interpreted
so
as
not
to
imply
a
miraculous
birth
the
resurrection
is
preached
but
is
interpreted
so
as
not
to
imply
a
miraculous
bodily
resurrection
the
bible
is
said
to
be
an
inspired
book
but
inspiration
is
used
in
a
vague
sense
much
as
when
one
says
that
plato
was
inspired
and
the
vagueness
of
this
new
idea
of
inspiration
is
even
put
forward
as
a
merit
between
the
extreme
views
which
discard
the
miraculous
altogether
and
the
old
orthodoxy
there
are
many
gradations
of
belief
in
the
church
of
england
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
what
is
the
minimum
belief
required
either
from
its
members
or
from
its
clergy
probably
every
leading
ecclesiastic
would
give
a
different
answer
the
rise
of
rationalism
within
the
english
church
is
interesting
and
illustrates
the
relations
between
church
and
state
the
pietistic
movement
known
as
evangelicalism
which
practical
view
of
christianity
did
much
to
make
popular
introduced
the
spirit
of
methodism
within
the
anglican
church
and
soon
put
an
end
to
the
delightful
type
of
divine
who
as
gibbon
says
with
a
sigh
or
a
the
articles
of
faith
the
rigorous
taboo
of
the
sabbath
was
revived
the
theatre
was
denounced
the
corruption
of
human
nature
became
the
dominant
theme
and
the
bible
more
a
fetish
than
ever
the
success
of
this
religious
as
it
is
called
was
aided
though
not
caused
by
the
common
belief
that
the
french
revolution
had
been
mainly
due
to
infidelity
the
revolution
was
taken
for
an
object
lesson
showing
the
value
of
religion
for
keeping
the
people
in
order
there
was
also
a
religious
in
france
itself
but
in
both
cases
this
means
not
that
free
thought
was
less
prevalent
but
that
the
beliefs
of
the
majority
were
more
aggressive
and
had
powerful
spokesmen
while
the
form
of
rationalism
fell
out
of
fashion
a
new
form
of
rationalism
which
sought
to
interpret
orthodoxy
in
such
a
liberal
way
as
to
reconcile
it
with
philosophy
was
represented
by
coleridge
who
was
influenced
by
german
philosophers
coleridge
was
a
supporter
of
the
church
and
he
contributed
to
the
foundation
of
a
school
of
liberal
theology
which
was
to
make
itself
felt
after
the
middle
of
the
century
newman
the
most
eminent
of
the
new
high
church
party
said
that
he
indulged
in
a
liberty
of
speculation
which
no
christian
could
tolerate
the
high
church
movement
which
marked
the
second
quarter
of
the
century
was
as
hostile
as
evangelicalism
to
the
freedom
of
religious
thought
the
change
came
after
the
middle
of
the
century
when
the
effects
of
the
philosophies
of
hegel
and
comte
and
of
foreign
biblical
criticism
began
to
make
themselves
felt
within
the
english
church
two
remarkable
freethinking
books
appeared
at
this
period
which
were
widely
read
phases
of
faith
and
creed
of
christendom
both
in
newman
brother
of
cardinal
newman
entirely
broke
with
christianity
and
in
his
book
he
describes
the
mental
process
by
which
he
came
to
abandon
the
beliefs
he
had
once
held
perhaps
the
most
interesting
point
he
makes
is
the
deficiency
of
the
new
testament
teaching
as
a
system
of
morals
greg
was
a
unitarian
he
rejected
dogma
and
inspiration
but
he
regarded
himself
as
a
christian
sir
stephen
wittily
described
his
position
as
that
of
a
disciple
had
heard
the
sermon
on
the
mount
whose
attention
had
not
been
called
to
the
miracles
and
who
died
before
the
there
were
a
few
english
clergymen
chiefly
oxford
men
who
were
interested
in
german
criticism
and
leaned
to
broad
views
which
to
the
evangelicals
and
high
churchmen
seemed
indistinguishable
from
infidelity
we
may
call
them
the
broad
the
name
did
not
come
in
till
later
in
jowett
afterwards
master
of
balliol
published
an
edition
of
some
of
epistles
in
which
he
showed
the
cloven
hoof
it
contained
an
annihilating
criticism
of
the
doctrine
of
the
atonement
an
explicit
rejection
of
original
sin
and
a
rationalistic
discussion
of
the
question
of
existence
but
this
and
some
other
unorthodox
works
of
liberal
theologians
attracted
little
public
attention
though
their
authors
had
to
endure
petty
persecution
five
years
later
jowett
and
some
other
members
of
the
small
liberal
group
decided
to
defy
the
system
of
terrorism
which
prevents
the
statement
of
the
plainest
fact
and
issued
a
volume
of
essays
and
reviews
by
seven
writers
of
whom
six
were
clergymen
the
views
advocated
in
these
essays
seem
mild
enough
and
many
of
them
would
be
accepted
by
most
clergymen
but
at
the
time
they
produced
a
very
painful
impression
the
authors
were
called
the
against
it
was
laid
down
that
the
bible
is
to
be
interpreted
like
any
other
book
is
not
a
useful
lesson
for
the
young
student
to
apply
to
scripture
principles
which
he
would
hesitate
to
apply
to
other
books
to
make
formal
reconcilements
of
discrepancies
which
he
would
not
think
of
reconciling
in
ordinary
history
to
divide
simple
words
into
double
meanings
to
adopt
the
fancies
or
conjectures
of
fathers
and
commentators
as
real
it
is
suggested
that
the
hebrew
prophecies
do
not
contain
the
element
of
prediction
contradictory
accounts
or
accounts
which
can
only
be
reconciled
by
conjecture
can
not
possibly
have
been
dictated
by
god
the
discrepancies
between
the
genealogies
of
jesus
in
matthew
and
luke
or
between
the
accounts
of
the
resurrection
can
be
attributed
to
any
defect
in
our
capacities
nor
to
any
reasonable
presumption
of
a
hidden
wise
design
nor
to
any
partial
spiritual
endowments
in
the
the
orthodox
arguments
which
lay
stress
on
the
assertion
of
witnesses
as
the
supreme
evidence
of
fact
in
support
of
miraculous
occurrences
are
set
aside
on
the
ground
that
testimony
is
a
blind
guide
and
can
avail
nothing
against
reason
and
the
strong
grounds
we
have
for
believing
in
permanent
order
it
is
argued
that
under
the
articles
it
is
permissible
to
accept
as
or
poetry
or
such
stories
as
that
of
an
ass
speaking
with
a
voice
of
waters
standing
in
a
solid
heap
of
witches
and
a
variety
of
apparitions
and
to
judge
for
ourselves
of
such
questions
as
the
personality
of
satan
or
the
primeval
institution
of
the
sabbath
the
whole
spirit
of
this
volume
is
perhaps
expressed
in
the
observation
that
if
any
one
perceives
how
great
an
extent
the
origin
itself
of
christianity
rests
upon
probable
evidence
his
principle
will
relieve
him
from
many
difficulties
which
might
otherwise
be
very
disturbing
for
relations
which
may
repose
on
doubtful
grounds
as
matters
of
history
and
as
history
be
incapable
of
being
ascertained
or
verified
may
yet
be
equally
suggestive
of
true
ideas
with
facts
absolutely
is
they
may
have
a
spiritual
significance
although
they
are
historically
false
the
most
daring
essay
was
the
rev
baden
study
of
the
evidences
of
christianity
he
was
a
believer
in
evolution
who
accepted
darwinism
and
considered
miracles
impossible
the
volume
was
denounced
by
the
bishops
and
in
two
of
the
contributors
who
were
beneficed
clergymen
and
thus
open
to
a
legal
attack
were
prosecuted
and
tried
in
the
ecclesiastical
court
condemned
on
certain
points
acquitted
on
others
they
were
sentenced
to
be
suspended
for
a
year
and
they
appealed
to
the
privy
council
lord
westbury
lord
chancellor
pronounced
the
judgment
of
the
judicial
committee
of
the
council
which
reversed
the
decision
of
the
ecclesiastical
court
the
committee
held
among
other
things
that
it
is
not
essential
for
a
clergyman
to
believe
in
eternal
punishment
this
prompted
the
following
epitaph
on
lord
westbury
the
close
of
his
earthly
career
he
dismissed
hell
with
costs
and
took
away
from
orthodox
members
of
the
church
of
england
their
last
hope
of
everlasting
this
was
a
great
triumph
for
the
broad
church
party
and
it
is
an
interesting
event
in
the
history
of
the
english
laymen
decided
overruling
the
opinion
of
the
archbishops
of
canterbury
and
york
what
theological
doctrines
are
and
are
not
binding
on
a
clergyman
and
granted
within
the
church
a
liberty
of
opinion
which
the
majority
of
the
representatives
regarded
as
pernicious
this
liberty
was
formally
established
in
by
an
act
of
parliament
which
altered
the
form
in
which
clergymen
were
required
to
subscribe
the
articles
the
episode
of
essays
and
reviews
is
a
landmark
in
the
history
of
religious
thought
in
england
the
liberal
views
of
the
broad
churchmen
and
their
attitude
to
the
bible
gradually
produced
some
effect
upon
those
who
differed
most
from
them
and
nowadays
there
is
probably
no
one
who
would
not
admit
at
least
that
such
a
passage
as
genesis
chapter
xix
might
have
been
composed
without
the
direct
inspiration
of
the
deity
during
the
next
few
years
orthodox
public
opinion
was
shocked
or
disturbed
by
the
appearance
of
several
remarkable
books
which
criticized
ignored
or
defied
antiquity
of
man
ecce
homo
which
the
pious
lord
shaftesbury
said
was
from
the
jaws
of
history
of
rationalism
and
a
new
poet
of
liberty
arose
who
did
not
fear
to
sound
the
loudest
notes
of
defiance
against
all
that
authority
held
sacred
all
the
great
poets
of
the
nineteenth
century
were
more
or
less
unorthodox
wordsworth
in
the
years
of
his
highest
inspiration
was
a
pantheist
and
the
greatest
of
all
shelley
was
a
declared
atheist
in
fearless
utterance
in
unfaltering
zeal
against
the
tyranny
of
gods
and
governments
swinburne
was
like
shelley
his
drama
atalanta
in
calydon
even
though
a
poet
is
strictly
not
answerable
for
what
the
persons
in
his
drama
say
yet
with
its
denunciation
of
supreme
evil
god
heralded
the
coming
of
a
new
champion
who
would
defy
the
fortresses
of
authority
and
in
the
following
year
his
poems
and
ballads
expressed
the
spirit
of
a
pagan
who
flouted
all
the
prejudices
and
sanctities
of
the
christian
world
but
the
most
intense
and
exciting
period
of
literary
warfare
against
orthodoxy
in
england
began
about
and
lasted
for
about
a
dozen
years
during
which
enemies
of
dogma
of
all
complexions
were
less
reticent
and
more
aggressive
than
at
any
other
time
in
the
century
lord
morley
has
observed
that
force
of
speculative
literature
always
hangs
on
practical
opportuneness
and
this
remark
is
illustrated
by
the
rationalistic
literature
of
the
seventies
it
was
a
time
of
hope
and
fear
of
progress
and
danger
secularists
and
rationalists
were
encouraged
by
the
disestablishment
of
the
church
in
ireland
by
the
act
which
allowed
atheists
to
give
evidence
in
a
court
of
justice
by
the
abolition
of
religious
tests
at
all
the
universities
a
measure
frequently
attempted
in
vain
in
on
the
other
hand
the
education
act
of
progressive
though
it
was
disappointed
the
advocates
of
secular
education
and
was
an
unwelcome
sign
of
the
strength
of
ecclesiastical
influence
then
there
was
the
general
alarm
felt
in
europe
by
all
outside
the
roman
church
and
by
some
within
it
at
the
decree
of
the
infallibility
of
the
pope
by
the
vatican
council
and
an
englishman
cardinal
manning
was
one
of
the
most
active
spirits
in
bringing
about
this
decree
it
would
perhaps
have
caused
less
alarm
if
the
denunciation
of
modern
errors
had
not
been
fresh
in
memories
at
the
end
of
he
startled
the
world
by
issuing
a
syllabus
the
principal
errors
of
our
among
these
were
the
propositions
that
every
man
is
free
to
adopt
and
profess
the
religion
he
considers
true
according
to
the
light
of
reason
that
the
church
has
no
right
to
employ
force
that
metaphysics
can
and
ought
to
be
pursued
without
reference
to
divine
and
ecclesiastical
authority
that
catholic
states
are
right
to
allow
foreign
immigrants
to
exercise
their
own
religion
in
public
that
the
pope
ought
to
make
terms
with
progress
liberalism
and
modern
civilization
the
document
was
taken
as
a
declaration
of
war
against
enlightenment
and
the
vatican
council
as
the
first
strategic
move
of
the
hosts
of
darkness
it
seemed
that
the
powers
of
obscurantism
were
lifting
up
their
heads
with
a
new
menace
and
there
was
an
instinctive
feeling
that
all
the
forces
of
reason
should
be
brought
into
the
field
the
history
of
the
last
forty
years
shows
that
the
theory
of
infallibility
since
it
has
become
a
dogma
is
not
more
harmful
than
it
was
before
but
the
efforts
of
the
catholic
church
in
the
years
following
the
council
to
overthrow
the
french
republic
and
to
rupture
the
new
german
empire
were
sufficiently
disquieting
against
this
was
to
be
set
the
destruction
of
the
temporal
power
of
the
popes
and
the
complete
freedom
of
italy
this
event
was
the
sunrise
of
songs
before
sunrise
which
appeared
in
a
seedplot
of
atheism
and
revolution
sown
with
implacable
hatred
of
creeds
and
tyrants
the
most
wonderful
poem
in
the
volume
the
hymn
of
man
was
written
while
the
vatican
council
was
sitting
it
is
a
song
of
triumph
over
the
god
of
the
priests
stricken
by
the
doom
of
the
temporal
power
the
concluding
verses
will
show
the
spirit
thy
name
that
in
hellfire
was
written
and
burned
at
the
point
of
thy
sword
thou
art
smitten
thou
god
thou
art
smitten
thy
death
is
upon
thee
o
lord
and
the
lovesong
of
earth
as
thou
diest
resounds
through
the
wind
of
her
glory
to
man
in
the
highest
for
man
is
the
master
of
the
fact
that
such
a
volume
could
appear
with
impunity
vividly
illustrates
the
english
policy
of
enforcing
the
laws
for
blasphemy
only
in
the
case
of
publications
addressed
to
the
masses
political
circumstances
thus
invited
and
stimulated
rationalists
to
come
forward
boldly
but
we
must
not
leave
out
of
account
the
influence
of
the
broad
church
movement
and
of
darwinism
the
descent
of
man
appeared
precisely
in
a
new
undogmatic
christianity
was
being
preached
in
pulpits
leslie
stephen
remarked
that
may
be
said
with
little
exaggeration
that
there
is
not
only
no
article
in
the
creeds
which
may
not
be
contradicted
with
impunity
but
that
there
is
none
which
may
not
be
contradicted
in
a
sermon
calculated
to
win
the
reputation
of
orthodoxy
and
be
regarded
as
a
judicious
bid
for
a
bishopric
the
popular
state
of
mind
seems
to
be
typified
in
the
known
anecdote
of
the
cautious
churchwarden
who
whilst
commending
the
general
tendency
of
his
sermon
felt
bound
to
hazard
a
protest
upon
one
point
see
sir
as
he
apologetically
explained
think
there
be
a
he
thought
it
an
error
of
taste
or
perhaps
of
judgment
to
hint
a
doubt
as
to
the
first
article
of
the
the
influence
exerted
among
the
cultivated
classes
by
the
aesthetic
movement
ruskin
morris
the
raphaelite
painters
then
lectures
on
the
renaissance
was
also
a
sign
of
the
times
for
the
attitude
of
these
critics
artists
and
poets
was
essentially
pagan
the
saving
truths
of
theology
were
for
them
as
if
they
did
not
exist
the
ideal
of
happiness
was
found
in
a
region
in
which
heaven
was
ignored
the
time
then
seemed
opportune
for
speaking
out
of
the
unorthodox
books
and
essays
which
influenced
the
young
and
alarmed
believers
in
these
exciting
years
most
were
the
works
of
men
who
may
be
most
fairly
described
by
the
comprehensive
term
name
which
had
been
recently
invented
by
professor
huxley
the
agnostic
holds
that
there
are
limits
to
human
reason
and
that
theology
lies
outside
those
limits
within
those
limits
lies
the
world
with
which
science
including
psychology
deals
science
deals
entirely
with
phenomena
and
has
nothing
to
say
to
the
nature
of
the
ultimate
reality
which
may
lie
behind
phenomena
there
are
four
possible
attitudes
to
this
ultimate
reality
there
is
the
attitude
of
the
metaphysician
and
theologian
who
are
convinced
not
only
that
it
exists
but
that
it
can
be
at
least
partly
known
there
is
the
attitude
of
the
man
who
denies
that
it
exists
but
he
must
be
also
a
metaphysician
for
its
existence
can
only
be
disproved
by
metaphysical
arguments
then
there
are
those
who
assert
that
it
exists
but
deny
that
we
can
know
anything
about
it
and
finally
there
are
those
who
say
that
we
can
not
know
whether
it
exists
or
not
these
last
are
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
term
men
who
profess
not
to
know
the
third
class
go
beyond
phenomena
in
so
far
as
they
assert
that
there
is
an
ultimate
though
unknowable
reality
beneath
phenomena
but
agnostic
is
commonly
used
in
a
wide
sense
so
as
to
include
the
third
as
well
as
the
fourth
who
assume
an
unknowable
as
well
as
those
who
do
not
know
whether
there
is
an
unknowable
or
not
comte
and
spencer
for
instance
who
believed
in
an
unknowable
are
counted
as
agnostics
the
difference
between
an
agnostic
and
an
atheist
is
that
the
atheist
positively
denies
the
existence
of
a
personal
god
the
agnostic
does
not
believe
in
it
the
writer
of
this
period
who
held
agnosticism
in
its
purest
form
and
who
turned
the
dry
light
of
reason
on
to
theological
opinions
with
the
most
merciless
logic
was
leslie
stephen
his
essay
fortnightly
review
raises
the
question
have
the
dogmas
of
orthodox
theologians
any
meaning
do
they
offer
for
this
is
what
we
want
an
intelligible
reconciliation
of
the
discords
in
the
universe
it
is
shown
in
detail
that
the
various
theological
explanations
of
the
dealings
of
god
with
man
when
logically
pressed
issue
in
a
confession
of
ignorance
and
what
is
this
but
agnosticism
you
may
call
your
doubt
a
mystery
but
mystery
is
only
the
theological
phrase
for
agnosticism
when
no
honest
man
will
deny
in
private
that
every
ultimate
problem
is
wrapped
in
the
profoundest
mystery
do
honest
men
proclaim
in
pulpits
that
unhesitating
certainty
is
the
duty
of
the
most
foolish
and
ignorant
we
are
a
company
of
ignorant
beings
dimly
discerning
light
enough
for
our
daily
needs
but
hopelessly
differing
whenever
we
attempt
to
describe
the
ultimate
origin
or
end
of
our
paths
and
yet
when
one
of
us
ventures
to
declare
that
we
know
the
map
of
the
universe
as
well
as
the
map
of
our
infinitesimal
parish
he
is
hooted
reviled
and
perhaps
told
that
he
will
be
damned
to
all
eternity
for
his
the
characteristic
of
leslie
essays
is
that
they
are
less
directed
to
showing
that
orthodox
theology
is
untrue
as
that
there
is
no
reality
about
it
and
that
its
solutions
of
difficulties
are
sham
solutions
if
it
solved
any
part
of
the
mystery
it
would
be
welcome
but
it
does
not
it
only
adds
new
difficulties
it
is
mere
edifice
of
the
writer
makes
no
attempt
to
prove
by
logic
that
ultimate
reality
lies
outside
the
limits
of
human
reason
he
bases
this
conclusion
on
the
fact
that
all
philosophers
hopelessly
contradict
one
another
if
the
of
philosophy
were
like
physical
science
within
the
reach
of
the
intelligence
some
agreement
must
have
been
reached
the
broad
church
movement
the
attempts
to
liberalize
christianity
to
pour
its
old
wine
into
new
bottles
to
make
it
unsectarian
and
undogmatic
to
find
compromises
between
theology
and
science
found
no
favour
in
leslie
eyes
and
he
criticized
all
this
with
a
certain
contempt
there
was
a
controversy
about
the
efficacy
of
prayer
is
it
reasonable
for
instance
to
pray
for
rain
here
science
and
theology
were
at
issue
on
a
practical
point
which
comes
within
the
domain
of
science
some
theologians
adopted
the
compromise
that
to
pray
against
an
eclipse
would
be
foolish
but
to
pray
for
rain
might
be
sensible
phenomenon
stephen
wrote
just
as
much
the
result
of
fixed
causes
as
the
other
but
it
is
easier
for
the
imagination
to
suppose
the
interference
of
a
divine
agent
to
be
hidden
away
somewhere
amidst
the
infinitely
complex
play
of
forces
which
elude
our
calculations
in
meteorological
phenomena
than
to
believe
in
it
where
the
forces
are
simple
enough
to
admit
of
prediction
the
distinction
is
of
course
invalid
in
a
scientific
sense
almighty
power
can
interfere
as
easily
with
the
events
which
are
as
with
those
which
are
not
in
the
nautical
almanac
one
can
not
suppose
that
god
retreats
as
science
advances
and
that
he
spoke
in
thunder
and
lightning
till
franklin
unravelled
the
laws
of
their
again
when
a
controversy
about
hell
engaged
public
attention
and
some
otherwise
orthodox
theologians
bethought
themselves
that
eternal
punishment
was
a
horrible
doctrine
and
then
found
that
the
evidence
for
it
was
not
quite
conclusive
and
were
bold
enough
to
say
so
leslie
stephen
stepped
in
to
point
out
that
if
so
historical
christianity
deserves
all
that
its
most
virulent
enemies
have
said
about
it
in
this
respect
when
the
christian
creed
really
ruled
consciences
nobody
could
utter
a
word
against
the
truth
of
the
dogma
of
hell
if
that
dogma
had
not
an
intimate
organic
connection
with
the
creed
if
it
had
been
a
mere
unimportant
accident
it
could
not
have
been
so
vigorous
and
persistent
wherever
christianity
was
strongest
the
attempt
to
eliminate
it
or
soften
it
down
is
a
sign
of
decline
at
last
your
creed
is
decaying
people
have
discovered
that
you
know
nothing
about
it
that
heaven
and
hell
belong
to
dreamland
that
the
impertinent
young
curate
who
tells
me
that
i
shall
be
burnt
everlastingly
for
not
sharing
his
superstition
is
just
as
ignorant
as
i
am
myself
and
that
i
know
as
much
as
my
dog
and
then
you
calmly
say
again
is
all
a
mistake
only
believe
in
a
something
we
will
make
it
as
easy
for
you
as
possible
hell
shall
have
no
more
than
a
fine
equable
temperature
really
good
for
the
constitution
there
shall
be
nobody
in
it
except
judas
iscariot
and
one
or
two
others
and
even
the
poor
devil
shall
have
a
chance
if
he
will
resolve
to
mend
his
matthew
arnold
may
i
suppose
be
numbered
among
the
agnostics
but
he
was
of
a
very
different
type
he
introduced
a
new
kind
of
criticism
of
the
criticism
deeply
concerned
for
morality
and
religion
a
supporter
of
the
established
church
he
took
the
bible
under
his
special
protection
and
in
three
works
paul
and
protestantism
literature
and
dogma
and
god
and
the
bible
he
endeavoured
to
rescue
that
book
from
its
orthodox
exponents
whom
he
regarded
as
the
corrupters
of
christianity
it
would
be
just
he
says
hardly
perhaps
christian
to
fling
back
the
word
infidel
at
the
orthodox
theologians
for
their
bad
literary
and
scientific
criticisms
of
the
bible
and
to
speak
of
torrent
of
infidelity
which
pours
every
sunday
from
our
pulpits
the
corruption
of
christianity
has
been
due
to
theology
its
insane
licence
of
affirmation
about
god
its
insane
licence
of
affirmation
about
to
the
hypothesis
of
magnified
and
man
at
the
head
of
and
the
and
the
fancy
account
of
god
up
by
putting
scattered
expressions
of
the
bible
together
and
taking
them
he
chastises
with
urbane
persiflage
the
knowledge
which
the
orthodox
think
they
possess
about
the
proceedings
and
plans
of
god
think
they
know
what
passed
in
the
council
of
the
trinity
is
not
hard
to
them
they
could
easily
think
they
even
knew
what
were
the
hangings
of
the
yet
very
expression
the
trinity
jars
with
the
whole
idea
and
character
of
but
lest
the
socinian
should
be
unduly
elated
at
hearing
this
let
us
hasten
to
add
that
so
too
and
just
as
much
does
the
expression
a
great
personal
first
he
uses
god
as
the
least
inadequate
name
for
that
universal
order
which
the
intellect
feels
after
as
a
law
and
the
heart
feels
after
as
a
benefit
and
defines
it
as
stream
of
tendency
by
which
all
things
strive
to
fulfil
the
law
of
their
he
defined
it
further
as
a
power
that
makes
for
righteousness
and
thus
went
considerably
beyond
the
agnostic
position
he
was
impatient
of
the
minute
criticism
which
analyzes
the
biblical
documents
and
discovers
inconsistencies
and
absurdities
and
he
did
not
appreciate
the
importance
of
the
comparative
study
of
religions
but
when
we
read
of
a
dignitary
in
a
recent
church
congress
laying
down
that
the
narratives
in
the
books
of
jonah
and
daniel
must
be
accepted
because
jesus
quoted
them
we
may
wish
that
arnold
were
here
to
reproach
the
orthodox
for
of
intellectual
these
years
also
saw
the
appearance
of
john
sympathetic
studies
of
the
french
freethinkers
of
the
eighteenth
century
voltaire
rousseau
and
diderot
he
edited
the
fortnightly
review
and
for
some
years
this
journal
was
distinguished
by
brilliant
criticisms
on
the
popular
religion
contributed
by
able
men
writing
from
many
points
of
view
a
part
of
the
book
which
he
afterwards
published
under
the
title
compromise
appeared
in
the
fortnightly
in
in

propositions
which
make
up
the
popular
belief
of
the
is
condemned
as
mischievous
and
it
is
urged
that
those
who
disbelieve
should
speak
out
plainly
speaking
out
is
an
intellectual
duty
englishmen
have
a
strong
sense
of
political
responsibility
and
a
correspondingly
weak
sense
of
intellectual
responsibility
even
minds
that
are
not
commonplace
are
affected
for
the
worse
by
the
political
spirit
which
the
great
force
in
throwing
love
of
truth
and
accurate
reasoning
into
a
secondary
and
the
principles
which
have
prevailed
in
politics
have
been
adopted
by
theology
for
her
own
use
in
the
one
case
convenience
first
truth
second
in
the
other
emotional
comfort
first
truth
second
if
the
immorality
is
less
gross
in
the
case
of
religion
there
is
stain
of
intellectual
and
this
is
a
crime
against
society
for
who
tamper
with
veracity
from
whatever
motive
are
tampering
with
the
vital
force
of
human
the
intellectual
insincerity
which
is
here
blamed
is
just
as
prevalent
day
the
english
have
not
changed
their
nature
the
spirit
is
still
rampant
and
we
are
ruled
by
the
view
that
because
compromise
is
necessary
in
politics
it
is
also
a
good
thing
in
the
intellectual
domain
the
fortnightly
under
guidance
was
an
effective
organ
of
enlightenment
i
have
no
space
to
touch
on
the
works
of
other
men
of
letters
and
of
men
of
science
in
these
combative
years
but
it
is
to
be
noted
that
while
denunciations
of
modern
thought
poured
from
the
pulpits
a
popular
diffusion
of
freethought
was
carried
on
especially
by
bradlaugh
in
public
lectures
and
in
his
paper
the
national
reformer
not
without
collisions
with
the
civil
authorities
if
we
take
the
cases
in
which
the
civil
authorities
in
england
have
intervened
to
repress
the
publication
of
unorthodox
opinions
during
the
last
two
centuries
we
find
that
the
object
has
always
been
to
prevent
the
spread
of
freethought
among
the
masses
the
victims
have
been
either
poor
uneducated
people
or
men
who
propagated
freethought
in
a
popular
form
i
touched
upon
this
before
in
speaking
of
paine
and
it
is
borne
out
by
the
prosecutions
of
the
nineteenth
and
twentieth
centuries
the
unconfessed
motive
has
been
fear
of
the
people
theology
has
been
regarded
as
a
good
instrument
for
keeping
the
poor
in
order
and
unbelief
as
a
cause
or
accompaniment
of
dangerous
political
opinions
the
idea
has
not
altogether
disappeared
that
free
thought
is
peculiarly
indecent
in
the
poor
that
it
is
highly
desirable
to
keep
them
superstitious
in
order
to
keep
them
contented
that
they
should
be
duly
thankful
for
all
the
theological
as
well
as
social
arrangements
which
have
been
made
for
them
by
their
betters
i
may
quote
from
an
essay
of
frederic
harrison
an
anecdote
which
admirably
expresses
the
becoming
attitude
of
the
poor
towards
ecclesiastical
institutions
master
of
a
workhouse
in
essex
was
once
called
in
to
act
as
chaplain
to
a
dying
pauper
the
poor
soul
faintly
murmured
some
hopes
of
heaven
but
this
the
master
abruptly
cut
short
and
warned
him
to
turn
his
last
thoughts
towards
hell
thankful
you
ought
to
be
said
he
you
have
a
hell
to
go
the
most
important
english
freethinkers
who
appealed
to
the
masses
were
holyoake
the
apostle
of
and
bradlaugh
the
great
achievement
for
which
bradlaugh
will
be
best
remembered
was
the
securing
of
the
right
of
unbelievers
to
sit
in
parliament
without
taking
an
oath
the
chief
work
to
which
holyoake
who
in
his
early
years
was
imprisoned
for
blasphemy
contributed
was
the
abolition
of
taxes
on
the
press
which
seriously
hampered
the
popular
diffusion
of
knowledge
in
england
censorship
of
the
press
had
long
ago
disappeared
above
in
most
other
european
countries
it
was
abolished
in
the
course
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
the
progressive
countries
of
europe
there
has
been
a
marked
growth
of
tolerance
i
do
not
mean
legal
toleration
but
the
tolerance
of
public
opinion
during
the
last
thirty
years
a
generation
ago
lord
morley
wrote
preliminary
stage
has
scarcely
been
stage
in
which
public
opinion
grants
to
every
one
the
unrestricted
right
of
shaping
his
own
beliefs
independently
of
those
of
the
people
who
surround
i
think
this
preliminary
stage
has
now
been
passed
take
england
we
are
now
far
from
the
days
when
arnold
would
have
sent
the
elder
mill
to
botany
bay
for
irreligious
opinions
but
we
are
also
far
from
the
days
when
descent
created
an
uproar
darwin
has
been
buried
in
westminster
abbey
books
can
appear
denying
the
historical
existence
of
jesus
without
causing
any
commotion
it
may
be
doubted
whether
what
lord
acton
wrote
in
would
be
true
now
are
in
our
day
many
educated
men
who
think
it
right
to
in
lecky
was
a
candidate
for
the
representation
of
dublin
university
his
rationalistic
opinions
were
indeed
brought
up
against
him
but
he
was
successful
though
the
majority
of
the
constituents
were
orthodox
in
the
seventies
his
candidature
would
have
been
hopeless
the
old
commonplace
that
a
freethinker
is
sure
to
be
immoral
is
no
longer
heard
we
may
say
that
we
have
now
reached
a
stage
at
which
it
is
admitted
by
every
one
who
counts
except
at
the
vatican
that
there
is
nothing
in
earth
or
heaven
which
may
not
legitimately
be
treated
without
any
of
the
assumptions
which
in
old
days
authority
used
to
impose
in
this
brief
review
of
the
triumphs
of
reason
in
the
nineteenth
century
we
have
been
considering
the
discoveries
of
science
and
criticism
which
made
the
old
orthodoxy
logically
untenable
but
the
advance
in
freedom
of
thought
the
marked
difference
in
the
general
attitude
of
men
in
all
lands
towards
theological
authority
from
the
attitude
of
a
hundred
years
ago
can
not
altogether
be
explained
by
the
power
of
logic
it
is
not
so
much
criticism
of
old
ideas
as
the
appearance
of
new
ideas
and
interests
that
changes
the
views
of
men
at
large
it
is
not
logical
demonstrations
but
new
social
conceptions
that
bring
about
a
general
transformation
of
attitude
towards
ultimate
problems
now
the
idea
of
the
progress
of
the
human
race
must
i
think
be
held
largely
answerable
for
this
change
of
attitude
it
must
i
think
be
held
to
have
operated
powerfully
as
a
solvent
of
theological
beliefs
i
have
spoken
of
the
teaching
of
diderot
and
his
friends
that
energies
should
be
devoted
to
making
the
earth
pleasant
a
new
ideal
was
substituted
for
the
old
ideal
based
on
theological
propositions
it
inspired
the
english
utilitarian
philosophers
bentham
james
mill
mill
grote
who
preached
the
greatest
happiness
of
the
greatest
number
as
the
supreme
object
of
action
and
the
basis
of
morality
this
ideal
was
powerfully
reinforced
by
the
doctrine
of
historical
progress
which
was
started
in
france
by
turgot
who
made
progress
the
organic
principle
of
history
it
was
developed
by
condorcet
and
put
forward
by
priestley
in
england
the
idea
was
seized
upon
by
the
french
socialistic
philosophers
and
fourier
the
optimism
of
fourier
went
so
far
as
to
anticipate
the
time
when
the
sea
would
be
turned
by
ingenuity
into
lemonade
when
there
would
be
million
poets
as
great
as
homer
million
writers
as
great
as
molière
million
men
of
science
equal
to
newton
but
it
was
comte
who
gave
the
doctrine
weight
and
power
his
social
philosophy
and
his
religion
of
humanity
are
based
upon
it
the
triumphs
of
science
endorsed
it
it
has
been
associated
with
though
it
is
not
necessarily
implied
in
the
scientific
theory
of
evolution
and
it
is
perhaps
fair
to
say
that
it
has
been
the
guiding
spiritual
force
of
the
nineteenth
century
it
has
introduced
the
new
ethical
principle
of
duty
to
posterity
we
shall
hardly
be
far
wrong
if
we
say
that
the
new
interest
in
the
future
and
the
progress
of
the
race
has
done
a
great
deal
to
undermine
unconsciously
the
old
interest
in
a
life
beyond
the
grave
and
it
has
dissolved
the
blighting
doctrine
of
the
radical
corruption
of
man
nowhere
has
the
theory
of
progress
been
more
emphatically
recognized
than
in
the
monistic
movement
which
has
been
exciting
great
interest
in
germany
this
movement
is
based
on
the
ideas
of
haeckel
who
is
looked
up
to
as
the
master
but
those
ideas
have
been
considerably
changed
under
the
influence
of
ostwald
the
new
leader
while
haeckel
is
a
biologist
brilliant
work
was
done
in
chemistry
and
physics
the
new
monism
differs
from
the
old
in
the
first
place
in
being
much
less
dogmatic
it
declares
that
all
that
is
in
our
experience
can
be
the
object
of
a
corresponding
science
it
is
much
more
a
method
than
a
system
for
its
sole
ultimate
object
is
to
comprehend
all
human
experience
in
unified
knowledge
secondly
while
it
maintains
with
haeckel
evolution
as
the
guiding
principle
in
the
history
of
living
things
it
rejects
his
pantheism
and
his
theory
of
thinking
atoms
the
old
mechanical
theory
of
the
physical
world
has
been
gradually
supplanted
by
the
theory
of
energy
and
ostwald
who
was
one
of
the
foremost
exponents
of
energy
has
made
it
a
leading
idea
of
monism
what
has
been
called
matter
is
so
far
as
we
know
now
simply
a
complex
of
energies
and
he
has
sought
to
extend
the
principle
from
physical
or
chemical
to
biological
psychical
and
social
phenomena
but
it
is
to
be
observed
that
no
finality
is
claimed
for
the
conception
of
energy
it
is
simply
an
hypothesis
which
corresponds
to
our
present
stage
of
knowledge
and
may
as
knowledge
advances
be
superseded
monism
resembles
the
positive
philosophy
and
religion
of
comte
in
so
far
as
it
means
an
outlook
on
life
based
entirely
on
science
and
excluding
theology
mysticism
and
metaphysics
it
may
be
called
a
religion
if
we
adopt
definition
of
religion
as
emotion
resting
on
a
conviction
of
the
harmony
between
ourselves
and
the
universe
at
but
it
is
much
better
not
to
use
the
word
religion
in
connexion
with
it
and
the
monists
have
no
thought
of
finding
a
monistic
as
comte
founded
a
positivist
church
they
insist
upon
the
sharp
opposition
between
the
outlook
of
science
and
the
outlook
of
religion
and
find
the
mark
of
spiritual
progress
in
the
fact
that
religion
is
gradually
becoming
less
indispensable
the
further
we
go
back
in
the
past
the
more
valuable
is
religion
as
an
element
in
civilization
as
we
advance
it
retreats
more
and
more
into
the
background
to
be
replaced
by
science
religions
have
been
in
principle
pessimistic
so
far
as
the
present
world
is
concerned
monism
is
in
principle
optimistic
for
it
recognizes
that
the
process
of
his
evolution
has
overcome
in
increasing
measure
the
bad
element
in
man
and
will
go
on
overcoming
it
still
more
monism
proclaims
that
development
and
progress
are
the
practical
principles
of
human
conduct
while
the
churches
especially
the
catholic
church
have
been
steadily
conservative
and
though
they
have
been
unable
to
put
a
stop
to
progress
have
endeavoured
to
suppress
its
bottle
up
the
steam
the
monistic
congress
at
hamburg
in
had
a
success
which
surprised
its
promoters
the
movement
bids
fair
to
be
a
powerful
influence
in
diffusing
rationalistic
thought
if
we
take
the
three
large
states
of
western
europe
in
which
the
majority
of
christians
are
catholics
we
see
how
the
ideal
of
progress
freedom
of
thought
and
the
decline
of
ecclesiastical
power
go
together
in
spain
where
the
church
has
enormous
power
and
wealth
and
can
still
dictate
to
the
court
and
the
politicians
the
idea
of
progress
which
is
vital
in
france
and
italy
has
not
yet
made
its
influence
seriously
felt
liberal
thought
indeed
is
widely
spread
in
the
small
educated
class
but
the
great
majority
of
the
whole
population
are
illiterate
and
it
is
the
interest
of
the
church
to
keep
them
so
the
education
of
the
people
as
all
enlightened
spaniards
confess
is
the
pressing
need
of
the
country
how
formidable
are
the
obstacles
which
will
have
to
be
overcome
before
modern
education
is
allowed
to
spread
was
shown
four
years
ago
by
the
tragedy
of
francisco
ferrer
which
reminded
everybody
that
in
one
corner
of
western
europe
the
mediaeval
spirit
is
still
vigorous
ferrer
had
devoted
himself
to
the
founding
of
modern
schools
in
the
province
of
catalonia
since
he
was
a
rationalist
and
his
schools
which
had
a
marked
success
were
entirely
secular
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
execrated
him
and
in
the
summer
of
chance
gave
them
the
means
of
destroying
him
a
strike
of
workmen
at
barcelona
developed
into
a
violent
revolution
ferrer
happened
to
be
in
barcelona
for
some
days
at
the
beginning
of
the
movement
with
which
he
had
no
connection
whatever
and
his
enemies
seized
the
opportunity
to
make
him
responsible
for
it
false
evidence
including
forged
documents
was
manufactured
evidence
which
would
have
helped
his
case
was
suppressed
the
catholic
papers
agitated
against
him
and
the
leading
ecclesiastics
of
barcelona
urged
the
government
not
to
spare
the
man
who
founded
the
modern
schools
the
root
of
all
the
trouble
ferrer
was
condemned
by
a
military
tribunal
and
shot
he
suffered
in
the
cause
of
reason
and
freedom
of
thought
though
as
there
is
no
longer
an
inquisition
his
enemies
had
to
kill
him
under
the
false
charge
of
anarchy
and
treason
it
is
possible
that
the
indignation
which
was
felt
in
europe
and
was
most
loudly
expressed
in
france
may
prevent
the
repetition
of
such
extreme
measures
but
almost
anything
may
happen
in
a
country
where
the
church
is
so
powerful
and
so
bigoted
and
the
politicians
so
corrupt
from

this
is
the
chief

chapter
viii
the
justification
of
liberty
of
thought
most
men
who
have
been
brought
up
in
the
free
atmosphere
of
a
modern
state
sympathize
with
liberty
in
its
long
struggle
with
authority
and
may
find
it
difficult
to
see
that
anything
can
be
said
for
the
tyrannical
and
as
they
think
extraordinarily
perverse
policy
by
which
communities
and
governments
persistently
sought
to
stifle
new
ideas
and
suppress
free
speculation
the
conflict
sketched
in
these
pages
appears
as
a
war
between
light
and
darkness
we
exclaim
that
altar
and
throne
formed
a
sinister
conspiracy
against
the
progress
of
humanity
we
look
back
with
horror
at
the
things
which
so
many
champions
of
reason
endured
at
the
hands
of
blind
if
not
malignant
bearers
of
authority
but
a
more
or
less
plausible
case
can
be
made
out
for
coercion
let
us
take
the
most
limited
view
of
the
lawful
powers
of
society
over
its
individual
members
let
us
lay
down
with
mill
that
sole
end
for
which
mankind
are
warranted
individually
and
collectively
in
interfering
with
the
liberty
of
action
of
any
of
their
members
is
protection
and
that
coercion
is
only
justified
for
the
prevention
of
harm
to
others
this
is
the
minimum
claim
the
state
can
make
and
it
will
be
admitted
that
it
is
not
only
the
right
but
the
duty
of
the
state
to
prevent
harm
to
its
members
that
is
what
it
is
for
now
no
abstract
or
independent
principle
is
discoverable
why
liberty
of
speech
should
be
a
privileged
form
of
liberty
of
action
or
why
society
should
lay
down
its
arms
of
defence
and
fold
its
hands
when
it
is
persuaded
that
harm
is
threatened
to
it
through
the
speech
of
any
of
its
members
the
government
has
to
judge
of
the
danger
and
its
judgment
may
be
wrong
but
if
it
is
convinced
that
harm
is
being
done
is
it
not
its
plain
duty
to
interfere
this
argument
supplies
an
apology
for
the
suppression
of
free
opinion
by
governments
in
ancient
and
modern
times
it
can
be
urged
for
the
inquisition
for
censorship
of
the
press
for
blasphemy
laws
for
all
coercive
measures
of
the
kind
that
if
excessive
or
they
were
intended
to
protect
society
against
what
their
authors
sincerely
believed
to
be
grave
injury
and
were
simple
acts
of
duty
this
apology
of
course
does
not
extend
to
acts
done
for
the
sake
of
the
alleged
good
of
the
victims
themselves
namely
to
secure
their
future
salvation
nowadays
we
condemn
all
such
measures
and
disallow
the
right
of
the
state
to
interfere
with
the
free
expression
of
opinion
so
deeply
is
the
doctrine
of
liberty
seated
in
our
minds
that
we
find
it
difficult
to
make
allowances
for
the
coercive
practices
of
our
misguided
ancestors
how
is
this
doctrine
justified
it
rests
on
no
abstract
basis
on
no
principle
independent
of
society
itself
but
entirely
on
considerations
of
utility
we
saw
how
socrates
indicated
the
social
value
of
freedom
of
discussion
we
saw
how
milton
observed
that
such
freedom
was
necessary
for
the
advance
of
knowledge
but
in
the
period
during
which
the
cause
of
toleration
was
fought
for
and
practically
won
the
argument
more
generally
used
was
the
injustice
of
punishing
a
man
for
opinions
which
he
honestly
held
and
could
not
help
holding
since
conviction
is
not
a
matter
of
will
in
other
words
the
argument
that
error
is
not
a
crime
and
that
it
is
therefore
unjust
to
punish
it
this
argument
however
does
not
prove
the
case
for
freedom
of
discussion
the
advocate
of
coercion
may
reply
we
admit
that
it
is
unjust
to
punish
a
man
for
private
erroneous
beliefs
but
it
is
not
unjust
to
forbid
the
propagation
of
such
beliefs
if
we
are
convinced
that
they
are
harmful
it
is
not
unjust
to
punish
him
not
for
holding
them
but
for
publishing
them
the
truth
is
that
in
examining
principles
the
word
just
is
misleading
all
the
virtues
are
based
on
experience
physiological
or
social
and
justice
is
no
exception
just
designates
a
class
of
rules
or
principles
of
which
the
social
utility
has
been
found
by
experience
to
be
paramount
and
which
are
recognized
to
be
so
important
as
to
override
all
considerations
of
immediate
expediency
and
social
utility
is
the
only
test
it
is
futile
therefore
to
say
to
a
government
that
it
acts
unjustly
in
coercing
opinion
unless
it
is
shown
that
freedom
of
opinion
is
a
principle
of
such
overmastering
social
utility
as
to
render
other
considerations
negligible
socrates
had
a
true
instinct
in
taking
the
line
that
freedom
is
valuable
to
society
the
reasoned
justification
of
liberty
of
thought
is
due
to
mill
who
set
it
forth
in
his
work
on
liberty
published
in
this
book
treats
of
liberty
in
general
and
attempts
to
fix
the
frontier
of
the
region
in
which
individual
freedom
should
be
considered
absolute
and
unassailable
the
second
chapter
considers
liberty
of
thought
and
discussion
and
if
many
may
think
that
mill
unduly
minimized
the
functions
of
society
underrating
its
claims
as
against
the
individual
few
will
deny
the
justice
of
the
chief
arguments
or
question
the
general
soundness
of
his
conclusions
pointing
out
that
no
fixed
standard
was
recognized
for
testing
the
propriety
of
the
interference
on
the
part
of
the
community
with
its
individual
members
he
finds
the
test
in
that
is
the
prevention
of
harm
to
others
he
bases
the
proposition
not
on
abstract
rights
but
on
in
the
largest
sense
grounded
on
the
permanent
interests
of
man
as
a
progressive
he
then
uses
the
following
argument
to
show
that
to
silence
opinion
and
discussion
is
always
contrary
to
those
permanent
interests
those
who
would
suppress
an
opinion
it
is
assumed
that
they
are
honest
deny
its
truth
but
they
are
not
infallible
they
may
be
wrong
or
right
or
partly
wrong
and
partly
right
if
they
are
wrong
and
the
opinion
they
would
crush
is
true
they
have
robbed
or
done
their
utmost
to
rob
mankind
of
a
truth
they
will
say
but
we
were
justified
for
we
exercised
our
judgment
to
the
best
of
our
ability
and
are
we
to
be
told
that
because
our
judgment
is
fallible
we
are
not
to
use
it
we
forbade
the
propagation
of
an
opinion
which
we
were
sure
was
false
and
pernicious
this
implies
no
greater
claim
to
infallibility
than
any
act
done
by
public
authority
if
we
are
to
act
at
all
we
must
assume
our
own
opinion
to
be
true
to
this
mill
acutely
replies
is
the
greatest
difference
between
assuming
an
opinion
to
be
true
because
with
every
opportunity
for
contesting
it
it
has
not
been
refuted
and
assuming
its
truth
for
the
purpose
of
not
permitting
its
refutation
complete
liberty
of
contradicting
and
disproving
our
opinion
is
the
very
condition
which
justifies
us
in
assuming
its
truth
for
purposes
of
action
and
on
no
other
terms
can
a
being
with
human
faculties
have
any
rational
assurance
of
being
if
the
received
opinion
which
it
is
sought
to
protect
against
the
intrusion
of
error
is
true
the
suppression
of
discussion
is
still
contrary
to
general
utility
a
received
opinion
may
happen
to
be
true
it
is
very
seldom
entirely
true
but
a
rational
certainty
that
it
is
so
can
only
be
secured
by
the
fact
that
it
has
been
fully
canvassed
but
has
not
been
shaken
commoner
and
more
important
is
the
case
where
the
conflicting
doctrines
share
the
truth
between
them
here
mill
has
little
difficulty
in
proving
the
utility
of
supplementing
popular
truths
by
other
truths
which
popular
opinion
omits
to
consider
and
he
observes
that
if
either
of
the
opinions
which
share
the
truth
has
a
claim
not
merely
to
be
tolerated
but
to
be
encouraged
it
is
the
one
which
happens
to
be
held
by
the
minority
since
this
is
the
one
for
the
time
being
represents
the
neglected
he
takes
the
doctrines
of
rousseau
which
might
conceivably
have
been
suppressed
as
pernicious
to
the
eighteenth
century
those
doctrines
came
as
salutary
shock
dislocating
the
compact
mass
of
the
current
opinions
were
indeed
nearer
to
the
truth
than
they
contained
much
less
of
error
there
lay
in
doctrine
and
has
floated
down
the
stream
of
opinion
along
with
it
a
considerable
amount
of
exactly
those
truths
which
the
popular
opinion
wanted
and
these
are
the
deposit
which
we
left
behind
when
the
flood
such
is
the
drift
of
main
argument
the
present
writer
would
prefer
to
state
the
justification
of
freedom
of
opinion
in
a
somewhat
different
form
though
in
accordance
with
reasoning
the
progress
of
civilization
if
it
is
partly
conditioned
by
circumstances
beyond
control
depends
more
and
in
an
increasing
measure
on
things
which
are
within
his
own
power
prominent
among
these
are
the
advancement
of
knowledge
and
the
deliberate
adaptation
of
his
habits
and
institutions
to
new
conditions
to
advance
knowledge
and
to
correct
errors
unrestricted
freedom
of
discussion
is
required
history
shows
that
knowledge
grew
when
speculation
was
perfectly
free
in
greece
and
that
in
modern
times
since
restrictions
on
inquiry
have
been
entirely
removed
it
has
advanced
with
a
velocity
which
would
seem
diabolical
to
the
slaves
of
the
mediaeval
church
then
it
is
obvious
that
in
order
to
readjust
social
customs
institutions
and
methods
to
new
needs
and
circumstances
there
must
be
unlimited
freedom
of
canvassing
and
criticizing
them
of
expressing
the
most
unpopular
opinions
no
matter
how
offensive
to
prevailing
sentiment
they
may
be
if
the
history
of
civilization
has
any
lesson
to
teach
it
is
this
there
is
one
supreme
condition
of
mental
and
moral
progress
which
it
is
completely
within
the
power
of
man
himself
to
secure
and
that
is
perfect
liberty
of
thought
and
discussion
the
establishment
of
this
liberty
may
be
considered
the
most
valuable
achievement
of
modern
civilization
and
as
a
condition
of
social
progress
it
should
be
deemed
fundamental
the
considerations
of
permanent
utility
on
which
it
rests
must
outweigh
any
calculations
of
present
advantage
which
from
time
to
time
might
be
thought
to
demand
its
violation
it
is
evident
that
this
whole
argument
depends
on
the
assumption
that
the
progress
of
the
race
its
intellectual
and
moral
development
is
a
reality
and
is
valuable
the
argument
will
not
appeal
to
any
one
who
holds
with
cardinal
newman
that
progress
and
perfectibility
is
a
dream
because
revelation
contradicts
and
he
may
consistently
subscribe
to
the
same
conviction
that
would
be
a
gain
to
this
country
were
it
vastly
more
superstitious
more
bigoted
more
gloomy
more
fierce
in
its
religion
than
at
present
it
shows
itself
to
while
mill
was
writing
his
brilliant
essay
which
every
one
should
read
the
english
government
of
the
day
instituted
prosecutions
for
the
circulation
of
the
doctrine
that
it
is
lawful
to
put
tyrants
to
death
on
the
ground
that
the
doctrine
is
immoral
fortunately
the
prosecutions
were
not
persisted
in
mill
refers
to
the
matter
and
maintains
that
such
a
doctrine
as
tyrannicide
and
let
us
add
anarchy
does
not
form
any
exception
to
the
rule
that
ought
to
exist
the
fullest
liberty
of
professing
and
discussing
as
a
matter
of
ethical
conviction
any
doctrine
however
immoral
it
may
be
exceptions
cases
where
the
interference
of
the
authorities
is
proper
are
only
apparent
for
they
really
come
under
another
rule
for
instance
if
there
is
a
direct
instigation
to
particular
acts
of
violence
there
may
be
a
legitimate
case
for
interference
but
the
incitement
must
be
deliberate
and
direct
if
i
write
a
book
condemning
existing
societies
and
defending
a
theory
of
anarchy
and
a
man
who
reads
it
presently
commits
an
outrage
it
may
clearly
be
established
that
my
book
made
the
man
an
anarchist
and
induced
him
to
commit
the
crime
but
it
would
be
illegitimate
to
punish
me
or
suppress
the
book
unless
it
contained
a
direct
incitement
to
the
specific
crime
which
he
committed
it
is
conceivable
that
difficult
cases
might
arise
where
a
government
might
be
strongly
tempted
and
might
be
urged
by
public
clamour
to
violate
the
principle
of
liberty
let
us
suppose
a
case
very
improbable
but
which
will
make
the
issue
clear
and
definite
imagine
that
a
man
of
highly
magnetic
personality
endowed
with
a
wonderful
power
of
infecting
others
with
his
own
ideas
however
irrational
in
short
a
typical
religious
leader
is
convinced
that
the
world
will
come
to
an
end
in
the
course
of
a
few
months
he
goes
about
the
country
preaching
and
distributing
pamphlets
his
words
have
an
electrical
effect
and
the
masses
of
the
uneducated
and
are
persuaded
that
they
have
indeed
only
a
few
weeks
to
prepare
for
the
day
of
judgment
multitudes
leave
their
occupations
abandon
their
work
in
order
to
spend
the
short
time
that
remains
in
prayer
and
listening
to
the
exhortations
of
the
prophet
the
country
is
paralyzed
by
the
gigantic
strike
traffic
and
industries
come
to
a
standstill
the
people
have
a
perfect
legal
right
to
give
up
their
work
and
the
prophet
has
a
perfect
legal
right
to
propagate
his
opinion
that
the
end
of
the
world
is
at
hand
opinion
which
jesus
christ
and
his
followers
in
their
day
held
quite
as
erroneously
it
would
be
said
that
desperate
ills
have
desperate
remedies
and
there
would
be
a
strong
temptation
to
suppress
the
fanatic
but
to
arrest
a
man
who
is
not
breaking
the
law
or
exhorting
any
one
to
break
it
or
causing
a
breach
of
the
peace
would
be
an
act
of
glaring
tyranny
many
will
hold
that
the
evil
of
setting
back
the
clock
of
liberty
would
balance
all
the
temporary
evils
great
as
they
might
be
caused
by
the
propagation
of
a
delusion
it
would
be
absurd
to
deny
that
liberty
of
speech
may
sometimes
cause
particular
harm
every
good
thing
sometimes
does
harm
government
for
instance
which
makes
fatal
mistakes
law
which
so
often
bears
hardly
and
inequitably
in
individual
cases
and
can
the
christians
urge
any
other
plea
for
their
religion
when
they
are
unpleasantly
reminded
that
it
has
caused
untold
suffering
by
its
principle
of
exclusive
salvation
once
the
principle
of
liberty
of
thought
is
accepted
as
a
supreme
condition
of
social
progress
it
passes
from
the
sphere
of
ordinary
expediency
into
the
sphere
of
higher
expediency
which
we
call
justice
in
other
words
it
becomes
a
right
on
which
every
man
should
be
able
to
count
the
fact
that
this
right
is
ultimately
based
on
utility
does
not
justify
a
government
in
curtailing
it
on
the
ground
of
utility
in
particular
cases
the
recent
rather
alarming
inflictions
of
penalties
for
blasphemy
in
england
illustrate
this
point
it
was
commonly
supposed
that
the
blasphemy
laws
see
above
though
unrepealed
were
a
dead
letter
but
since
december
half
a
dozen
persons
have
been
imprisoned
for
this
offence
in
these
cases
christian
doctrines
were
attacked
by
poor
and
more
or
less
uneducated
persons
in
language
which
may
be
described
as
coarse
and
offensive
some
of
the
judges
seem
to
have
taken
the
line
that
it
is
not
blasphemy
to
attack
the
fundamental
doctrines
provided
decencies
of
are
preserved
but
that
attacks
constitute
blasphemy
this
implies
a
new
definition
of
legal
blasphemy
and
is
entirely
contrary
to
the
intention
of
the
laws
sir
stephen
pointed
out
that
the
decisions
of
judges
from
the
time
of
lord
hale
xviith
century
to
the
trial
of
foote
laid
down
the
same
doctrine
and
based
it
on
the
same
principle
the
doctrine
being
that
it
is
a
crime
either
to
deny
the
truth
of
the
fundamental
doctrines
of
the
christian
religion
or
to
hold
them
up
to
contempt
or
ridicule
and
the
principle
being
that
christianity
is
a
part
of
the
law
of
the
land
the
apology
offered
for
such
prosecutions
is
that
their
object
is
to
protect
religious
sentiment
from
insult
and
ridicule
sir
stephen
observed
the
law
were
really
impartial
and
punished
blasphemy
only
because
it
offends
the
feelings
of
believers
it
ought
also
to
punish
such
preaching
as
offends
the
feelings
of
unbelievers
all
the
more
earnest
and
enthusiastic
forms
of
religion
are
extremely
offensive
to
those
who
do
not
believe
if
the
law
does
not
in
any
sense
recognize
the
truth
of
christian
doctrine
it
would
have
to
apply
the
same
rule
to
the
salvation
army
in
fact
the
law
be
explained
and
justified
only
on
what
i
regard
as
its
true
principle
of
the
opponents
of
christianity
may
justly
say
if
christianity
is
false
why
is
it
to
be
attacked
only
in
polite
language
its
goodness
depends
on
its
truth
if
you
grant
its
falsehood
you
can
not
maintain
that
it
deserves
special
protection
but
the
law
imposes
no
restraint
on
the
christian
however
offensive
his
teaching
may
be
to
those
who
do
not
agree
with
him
therefore
it
is
not
based
on
an
impartial
desire
to
prevent
the
use
of
language
which
causes
offence
therefore
it
is
based
on
the
hypothesis
that
christianity
is
true
and
therefore
its
principle
is
persecution
of
course
the
present
administration
of
the
common
law
in
regard
to
blasphemy
does
not
endanger
the
liberty
of
those
unbelievers
who
have
the
capacity
for
contributing
to
progress
but
it
violates
the
supreme
principle
of
liberty
of
opinion
and
discussion
it
hinders
uneducated
people
from
saying
in
the
only
ways
in
which
they
know
how
to
say
it
what
those
who
have
been
brought
up
differently
say
with
impunity
far
more
effectively
and
far
more
insidiously
some
of
the
men
who
have
been
imprisoned
during
the
last
two
years
only
uttered
in
language
of
deplorable
taste
views
that
are
expressed
more
or
less
politely
in
books
which
are
in
the
library
of
a
bishop
unless
he
is
a
very
ignorant
person
and
against
which
the
law
if
it
has
any
validity
ought
to
have
been
enforced
thus
the
law
as
now
administered
simply
penalizes
bad
taste
and
places
disabilities
upon
uneducated
freethinkers
if
their
words
offend
their
audience
so
far
as
to
cause
a
disturbance
they
should
be
prosecuted
for
a
breach
of
public
order
not
because
their
words
are
blasphemous
a
man
who
robs
or
injures
a
church
or
even
an
episcopal
palace
is
not
prosecuted
for
sacrilege
but
for
larceny
or
malicious
damage
or
something
of
the
kind
the
abolition
of
penalties
for
blasphemy
was
proposed
in
the
house
of
commons
by
bradlaugh
in
and
rejected
the
reform
is
urgently
needed
it
would
the
recurrence
at
irregular
intervals
of
scandalous
prosecutions
which
have
never
in
any
one
instance
benefited
any
one
least
of
all
the
cause
which
they
were
intended
to
serve
and
which
sometimes
afford
a
channel
for
the
gratification
of
private
malice
under
the
cloak
of
the
struggle
of
reason
against
authority
has
ended
in
what
appears
now
to
be
a
decisive
and
permanent
victory
for
liberty
in
the
most
civilized
and
progressive
countries
freedom
of
discussion
is
recognized
as
a
fundamental
principle
in
fact
we
may
say
it
is
accepted
as
a
test
of
enlightenment
and
the
man
in
the
street
is
forward
in
acknowledging
that
countries
like
russia
and
spain
where
opinion
is
more
or
less
fettered
must
on
that
account
be
considered
less
civilized
than
their
neighbours
all
intellectual
people
who
count
take
it
for
granted
that
there
is
no
subject
in
heaven
or
earth
which
ought
not
to
be
investigated
without
any
deference
or
reference
to
theological
assumptions
no
man
of
science
has
any
fear
of
publishing
his
researches
whatever
consequences
they
may
involve
for
current
beliefs
criticism
of
religious
doctrines
and
of
political
and
social
institutions
is
free
hopeful
people
may
feel
confident
that
the
victory
is
permanent
that
intellectual
freedom
is
now
assured
to
mankind
as
a
possession
for
ever
that
the
future
will
see
the
collapse
of
those
forces
which
still
work
against
it
and
its
gradual
diffusion
in
the
more
backward
parts
of
the
earth
yet
history
may
suggest
that
this
prospect
is
not
assured
can
we
be
certain
that
there
may
not
come
a
great
back
for
freedom
of
discussion
and
speculation
was
as
we
saw
fully
realized
in
the
greek
and
roman
world
and
then
an
unforeseen
force
in
the
shape
of
christianity
came
in
and
laid
chains
upon
the
human
mind
and
suppressed
freedom
and
imposed
upon
man
a
weary
struggle
to
recover
the
freedom
which
he
had
lost
is
it
not
conceivable
that
something
of
the
same
kind
may
occur
again
that
some
new
force
emerging
from
the
unknown
may
surprise
the
world
and
cause
a
similar
the
possibility
can
not
be
denied
but
there
are
some
considerations
which
render
it
improbable
apart
from
a
catastrophe
sweeping
away
european
culture
there
are
certain
radical
differences
between
the
intellectual
situation
now
and
in
antiquity
the
facts
known
to
the
greeks
about
the
nature
of
the
physical
universe
were
few
much
that
was
taught
was
not
proved
compare
what
they
knew
and
what
we
know
about
astronomy
and
take
the
two
branches
in
which
besides
mathematics
they
made
most
progress
when
there
were
so
few
demonstrated
facts
to
work
upon
there
was
the
widest
room
for
speculation
now
to
suppress
a
number
of
rival
theories
in
favour
of
one
is
a
very
different
thing
from
suppressing
whole
systems
of
established
facts
if
one
school
of
astronomers
holds
that
the
earth
goes
round
the
sun
another
that
the
sun
goes
round
the
earth
but
neither
is
able
to
demonstrate
its
proposition
it
is
easy
for
an
authority
which
has
coercive
power
to
suppress
one
of
them
successfully
but
once
it
is
agreed
by
all
astronomers
that
the
earth
goes
round
the
sun
it
is
a
hopeless
task
for
any
authority
to
compel
men
to
accept
a
false
view
in
short
because
she
is
in
possession
of
a
vast
mass
of
ascertained
facts
about
the
nature
of
the
universe
reason
holds
a
much
stronger
position
now
than
at
the
time
when
christian
theology
led
her
captive
all
these
facts
are
her
fortifications
again
it
is
difficult
to
see
what
can
arrest
the
continuous
progress
of
knowledge
in
the
future
in
ancient
times
this
progress
depended
on
a
few
nowadays
many
nations
take
part
in
the
work
a
general
conviction
of
the
importance
of
science
prevails
which
did
not
prevail
in
greece
and
the
circumstance
that
the
advance
of
material
civilization
depends
on
science
is
perhaps
a
practical
guarantee
that
scientific
research
will
not
come
to
an
abrupt
halt
in
fact
science
is
now
a
social
institution
as
much
as
religion
but
if
science
seems
pretty
safe
it
is
always
possible
that
in
countries
where
the
scientific
spirit
is
held
in
honour
nevertheless
serious
restrictions
may
be
laid
on
speculations
touching
social
political
and
religious
questions
russia
has
men
of
science
inferior
to
none
and
russia
has
its
notorious
censorship
it
is
by
no
means
inconceivable
that
in
lands
where
opinion
is
now
free
coercion
might
be
introduced
if
a
revolutionary
social
movement
prevailed
led
by
men
inspired
by
faith
in
formulas
like
the
men
of
the
french
revolution
and
resolved
to
impose
their
creed
experience
shows
that
coercion
would
almost
inevitably
be
resorted
to
nevertheless
while
it
would
be
silly
to
suppose
that
attempts
may
not
be
made
in
the
future
to
put
back
the
clock
liberty
is
in
a
far
more
favourable
position
now
than
under
the
roman
empire
for
at
that
time
the
social
importance
of
freedom
of
opinion
was
not
appreciated
whereas
now
in
consequence
of
the
long
conflict
which
was
necessary
in
order
to
establish
it
men
consciously
realize
its
value
perhaps
this
conviction
will
be
strong
enough
to
resist
all
conspiracies
against
liberty
meanwhile
nothing
should
be
left
undone
to
impress
upon
the
young
that
freedom
of
thought
is
an
axiom
of
human
progress
it
may
be
feared
however
that
this
is
not
likely
to
be
done
for
a
long
time
to
come
for
our
methods
of
early
education
are
founded
on
authority
it
is
true
that
children
are
sometimes
exhorted
to
think
for
themselves
but
the
parent
or
instructor
who
gives
this
excellent
advice
is
confident
that
the
results
of
the
thinking
for
himself
will
agree
with
the
opinions
which
his
elders
consider
desirable
it
is
assumed
that
he
will
reason
from
principles
which
have
already
been
instilled
into
him
by
authority
but
if
his
thinking
for
himself
takes
the
form
of
questioning
these
principles
whether
moral
or
religious
his
parents
and
teachers
unless
they
are
very
exceptional
persons
will
be
extremely
displeased
and
will
certainly
discourage
him
it
is
of
course
only
singularly
promising
children
whose
freedom
of
thought
will
go
so
far
in
this
sense
it
might
be
said
that
thy
father
and
is
the
first
commandment
with
promise
it
should
be
a
part
of
education
to
explain
to
children
as
soon
as
they
are
old
enough
to
understand
when
it
is
reasonable
and
when
it
is
not
to
accept
what
they
are
told
on
authority
blasphemy
is
an
offence
in
germany
but
it
must
be
proved
that
offence
has
actually
been
given
and
the
penalty
does
not
exceed
imprisonment
