the

was
organized
and
as
a
part
of
its
work
the
following
resolution
was
passed
it
is
exceedingly
desirable
that
important
treatises
on
criminology
in
foreign
languages
be
made
readily
accessible
in
the
english
language
that
the
president
appoint
a
committee
of
five
with
power
to
select
such
treatises
as
in
their
judgment
should
be
translated
and
to
arrange
for
their
the
committee
appointed
under
this
resolution
has
made
careful
investigation
of
the
literature
of
the
subject
and
has
consulted
by
frequent
correspondence
it
has
selected
several
works
from
among
the
mass
of
material
it
has
arranged
with
publisher
with
authors
and
with
translators
for
the
immediate
undertaking
and
rapid
progress
of
the
task
it
realizes
the
necessity
of
educating
the
professions
and
the
public
by
the
wide
diffusion
of
information
on
this
subject
it
desires
here
to
explain
the
considerations
which
have
moved
it
in
seeking
to
select
the
treatises
best
adapted
to
the
purpose
for
the
community
at
large
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
criminal
science
is
a
larger
thing
than
criminal
law
the
legal
profession
in
particular
has
a
duty
to
familiarize
itself
with
the
principles
of
that
science
as
the
sole
means
for
intelligent
and
systematic
improvement
of
the
criminal
law
two
centuries
ago
while
modern
medical
science
was
still
young
medical
practitioners
proceeded
upon
two
general
assumptions
one
as
to
the
cause
of
disease
the
other
as
to
its
treatment
as
to
the
cause
of
disease
disease
was
sent
by
the
inscrutable
will
of
god
no
man
could
fathom
that
will
nor
its
arbitrary
operation
as
to
the
treatment
of
disease
there
were
believed
to
be
a
few
remedial
agents
of
universal
efficacy
calomel
and
bloodletting
for
example
were
two
of
the
principal
ones
a
larger
or
smaller
dose
of
calomel
a
greater
or
less
quantity
of
bloodletting
this
blindly
indiscriminate
mode
of
treatment
was
regarded
as
orthodox
for
all
common
varieties
of
ailment
and
so
his
calomel
pill
and
his
bloodletting
lancet
were
carried
everywhere
with
him
by
the
doctor
nowadays
all
this
is
past
in
medical
science
as
to
the
causes
of
disease
we
know
that
they
are
facts
of
nature
various
but
distinguishable
by
diagnosis
and
research
and
more
or
less
capable
of
prevention
or
control
or
as
to
the
treatment
we
now
know
that
there
are
various
specific
modes
of
treatment
for
specific
causes
or
symptoms
and
that
the
treatment
must
be
adapted
to
the
cause
in
short
the
individualization
of
disease
in
cause
and
in
treatment
is
the
dominant
truth
of
modern
medical
science
the
same
truth
is
now
known
about
crime
but
the
understanding
and
the
application
of
it
are
just
opening
upon
us
the
old
and
still
dominant
thought
is
as
to
cause
that
a
crime
is
caused
by
the
inscrutable
moral
free
will
of
the
human
being
doing
or
not
doing
the
crime
just
as
it
pleases
absolutely
free
in
advance
at
any
moment
of
time
to
choose
or
not
to
choose
the
criminal
act
and
therefore
in
itself
the
sole
and
ultimate
cause
of
crime
as
to
treatment
there
still
are
just
two
traditional
measures
used
in
varying
doses
for
all
kinds
of
crime
and
all
kinds
of
persons
jail
or
a
fine
for
death
is
now
employed
in
rare
cases
only
but
modern
science
here
as
in
medicine
recognizes
that
crime
also
like
disease
has
natural
causes
it
need
not
be
asserted
for
one
moment
that
crime
is
a
disease
but
it
does
have
natural
causes
that
is
circumstances
which
work
to
produce
it
in
a
given
case
and
as
to
treatment
modern
science
recognizes
that
penal
or
remedial
treatment
can
not
possibly
be
indiscriminate
and
but
must
be
adapted
to
the
causes
and
to
the
man
as
affected
by
those
causes
common
sense
and
logic
alike
require
inevitably
that
the
moment
we
predicate
a
specific
cause
for
an
undesirable
effect
the
remedial
treatment
must
be
specifically
adapted
to
that
cause
thus
the
great
truth
of
the
present
and
the
future
for
criminal
science
is
the
individualization
of
penal
treatment
for
that
man
and
for
the
cause
of
that
crime
now
this
truth
opens
up
a
vast
field
for
it
means
that
we
must
study
all
the
possible
data
that
can
be
causes
of
crime
the
heredity
the
physical
and
moral
his
emotional
temperament
the
surroundings
of
his
youth
his
present
home
and
other
conditions
all
the
influencing
circumstances
and
it
means
that
the
effect
of
different
methods
of
treatment
old
or
new
for
different
kinds
of
men
and
of
causes
must
be
studied
experimented
and
compared
only
in
this
way
can
accurate
knowledge
be
reached
and
new
efficient
measures
be
adopted
all
this
has
been
going
on
in
europe
for
forty
years
past
and
in
limited
fields
in
this
country
all
the
branches
of
science
that
can
help
have
been
working
anthropology
medicine
psychology
economics
sociology
philanthropy
penology
the
law
alone
has
abstained
the
science
of
law
is
the
one
to
be
served
by
all
this
but
the
public
in
general
and
the
legal
profession
in
particular
have
remained
either
ignorant
of
the
entire
subject
or
indifferent
to
the
entire
scientific
movement
and
this
ignorance
or
indifference
has
blocked
the
way
to
progress
in
administration
the
institute
therefore
takes
upon
itself
as
one
of
its
aims
to
inculcate
the
study
of
modern
criminal
science
as
a
pressing
duty
for
the
legal
profession
and
for
the
thoughtful
community
at
large
one
of
its
principal
modes
of
stimulating
and
aiding
this
study
is
to
make
available
in
the
english
language
the
most
useful
treatises
now
extant
in
the
continental
languages
our
country
has
started
late
there
is
much
to
catch
up
with
in
the
results
reached
elsewhere
we
shall
to
be
sure
profit
by
the
long
period
of
argument
and
theorizing
and
experimentation
which
european
thinkers
and
workers
have
passed
through
but
to
reap
that
profit
the
results
of
their
experience
must
be
made
accessible
in
the
english
language
the
effort
in
selecting
this
series
of
translations
has
been
to
choose
those
works
which
best
represent
the
various
schools
of
thought
in
criminal
science
the
general
results
reached
the
points
of
contact
or
of
controversy
and
the
contrasts
of
method
having
always
in
view
that
class
of
works
which
have
a
more
than
local
value
and
could
best
be
serviceable
to
criminal
science
in
our
country
as
the
science
has
various
aspects
and
emphases
the
anthropological
psychological
sociological
legal
statistical
economic
pathological
due
regard
was
paid
in
the
selection
to
a
representation
of
all
these
aspects
and
as
the
several
continental
countries
have
contributed
in
different
ways
to
these
various
aspects
france
germany
italy
most
abundantly
but
the
others
each
its
share
the
effort
was
made
also
to
recognize
the
different
contributions
as
far
as
feasible
the
selection
made
by
the
committee
then
represents
its
judgment
of
the
works
that
are
most
useful
and
most
instructive
for
the
purpose
of
translation
it
is
its
conviction
that
this
series
when
completed
will
furnish
the
american
student
of
criminal
science
a
systematic
and
sufficient
acquaintance
with
the
controlling
doctrines
and
methods
that
now
hold
the
stage
of
thought
in
continental
europe
which
of
the
various
principles
and
methods
will
prove
best
adapted
to
help
our
problems
can
only
be
told
after
our
students
and
workers
have
tested
them
in
our
own
experience
but
it
is
certain
that
we
must
first
acquaint
ourselves
with
these
results
of
a
generation
of
european
thought
in
closing
the
committee
thinks
it
desirable
to
refer
the
members
of
the
institute
for
purposes
of
further
investigation
of
the
literature
to

introduction
to
the
english
version
what
professor
gross
presents
in
this
volume
is
nothing
less
than
an
applied
psychology
of
the
judicial
processes
a
critical
survey
of
the
procedures
incident
to
the
administration
of
justice
with
due
recognition
of
their
intrinsically
psychological
character
and
yet
with
the
insight
conferred
by
a
responsible
experience
with
a
working
system
there
is
nothing
more
significant
in
the
history
of
institutions
than
their
tendency
to
get
in
the
way
of
the
very
purposes
which
they
were
devised
to
meet
the
adoration
of
measures
seems
to
be
an
ineradicable
human
trait
prophets
and
reformers
ever
insist
upon
the
values
of
ideals
and
ends
the
spiritual
meanings
of
things
while
the
people
as
naturally
drift
to
the
worship
of
cults
and
ceremonies
and
thus
secure
the
more
superficial
while
losing
the
deeper
satisfactions
of
a
duty
performed
so
restraining
is
the
formal
rigidity
of
primitive
cultures
that
the
mind
of
man
hardly
moves
within
their
enforced
orbits
in
complex
societies
the
conservatism
which
is
at
once
profitably
conservative
and
needlessly
obstructing
assumes
a
more
intricate
a
more
evasive
and
a
more
engaging
form
in
an
age
for
which
machinery
has
accomplished
such
heroic
service
the
dependence
upon
mechanical
devices
acquires
quite
unprecedented
dimensions
it
is
compatible
with
if
not
provocative
of
a
mental
indolence
an
attention
to
details
sufficient
to
operate
the
machinery
but
a
disinclination
to
think
about
the
principles
of
the
ends
of
its
operation
there
is
no
set
of
human
relations
that
exhibits
more
distinctively
the
issues
of
these
undesirable
tendencies
than
those
which
the
process
of
law
adjusts
we
have
lost
utterly
the
older
sense
of
a
hallowed
fealty
towards
law
we
are
not
suffering
from
the
inflexibility
of
the
medes
and
the
persians
we
manufacture
laws
as
readily
as
we
do
and
change
their
patterns
to
suit
the
roads
we
have
to
build
but
with
the
profit
of
our
adaptability
we
are
in
danger
of
losing
the
underlying
sense
of
purpose
that
inspires
and
continues
to
justify
measures
and
to
lose
also
a
certain
intimate
intercourse
with
problems
of
theory
and
philosophy
which
is
one
of
the
requisites
of
a
professional
equipment
and
one
nowhere
better
appreciated
than
in
countries
loyal
to
teutonic
ideals
of
culture
the
present
volume
bears
the
promise
of
performing
a
notable
service
for
english
readers
by
rendering
accessible
an
admirable
review
of
the
data
and
principles
germane
to
the
practices
of
justice
as
related
to
their
intimate
conditioning
in
the
psychological
traits
of
men
the
significant
fact
in
regard
to
the
procedures
of
justice
is
that
they
are
of
men
by
men
and
for
men
any
attempt
to
eliminate
unduly
the
human
element
or
to
esteem
a
system
apart
from
its
adaptation
to
the
psychology
of
human
traits
as
they
serve
the
ends
of
justice
is
likely
to
result
in
a
justice
and
a
mechanical
administration
as
a
means
of
furthering
the
plasticity
of
the
law
of
infusing
it
with
a
large
human
vitality
a
movement
of
large
scope
in
which
religion
and
ethics
economics
and
sociology
are
worthily
cooperating
the
psychology
of
the
party
of
the
first
part
and
the
party
of
the
second
part
may
well
be
considered
the
psychology
of
the
judge
enters
into
the
consideration
as
influentially
as
the
psychology
of
the
offender
the
of
the
problems
thus
unified
in
a
common
application
is
worthy
of
emphasis
there
is
the
problem
of
evidence
the
ability
of
a
witness
to
observe
and
recount
an
incident
and
the
distortions
to
which
such
report
is
liable
through
errors
of
sense
confusion
of
inference
with
observation
weakness
of
judgment
prepossession
emotional
interest
excitement
or
an
abnormal
mental
condition
it
is
the
view
that
the
judge
should
understand
these
relations
not
merely
in
their
narrower
practical
bearings
but
in
their
larger
and
more
theoretical
aspects
which
the
study
of
psychology
as
a
comprehensive
science
sets
forth
there
is
the
allied
problem
of
testimony
and
belief
which
concerns
the
peculiarly
judicial
qualities
to
ease
the
step
from
ideas
to
their
expression
to
estimate
motive
and
intention
to
know
and
appraise
at
their
proper
value
the
logical
weaknesses
and
personal
foibles
of
all
kinds
and
conditions
of
offenders
and
witnesses
to
do
this
in
accord
with
high
standards
requires
that
men
as
well
as
evidence
shall
be
judged
allied
to
this
problem
which
appeals
to
a
large
range
of
psychological
doctrine
there
is
yet
another
which
appeals
to
a
yet
larger
and
more
intricate
range
that
of
human
character
and
condition
crimes
are
such
complex
issues
as
to
demand
the
systematic
diagnosis
of
the
criminal
heredity
and
environment
associations
and
standards
initiative
and
suggestibility
may
all
be
condoning
as
well
as
aggravating
factors
of
what
becomes
a
the
peculiar
temptations
of
distinctive
periods
of
life
the
perplexing
intrusion
of
subtle
abnormalities
particularly
when
of
a
sexual
type
have
brought
it
about
that
the
psychologist
has
extended
his
laboratory
procedures
to
include
the
study
of
such
deviation
and
thus
a
common
set
of
findings
have
an
equally
pertinent
though
a
different
interest
for
the
theoretical
student
of
relations
and
the
practitioner
there
are
as
well
certain
special
psychological
conditions
that
may
color
and
quite
transform
the
interpretation
of
a
situation
or
a
bit
of
testimony
to
distinguish
between
hysterical
deception
and
lying
between
a
superstitious
believer
in
the
reality
of
an
experience
and
the
victim
of
an
actual
hallucination
to
detect
whether
a
condition
of
emotional
excitement
or
despair
is
a
cause
or
an
effect
is
no
less
a
psychological
problem
than
the
more
popularly
discussed
question
of
compelling
confession
of
guilt
by
the
analysis
of
laboratory
reactions
it
may
well
be
that
judges
and
lawyers
and
men
of
science
will
continue
to
differ
in
their
estimate
of
the
aid
which
may
come
to
the
practical
pursuits
from
a
knowledge
of
the
relations
as
the
psychologist
presents
them
in
a
but
yet
systematic
analysis
professor
gross
believes
thoroughly
in
its
importance
and
those
who
read
his
book
will
arrive
at
a
clearer
view
of
the
methods
and
issues
that
give
character
to
this
notable

the
author
of
the
volume
is
a
distinguished
representative
of
the
modern
scientific
study
of

as
he
prefers
to
call
it
he
was
born
december
in

pursued
his
university
studies
at
vienna

graz
and
qualified
for
the
law
in

in
other
capacities
and
received
his
first
academic
appointment
as

was
later
attached
to
the
german
university
at

and
is
now
professor
in

he
is
the
author
of
a
considerable
range
of
volumes
bearing
on
the
administration
of
criminal
law
and
upon
the
theoretical
foundations
of
the
science
of

issued
his

a
work
that
reached
its
fifth

about
twenty

is
an
admirable
representative
of
an
efficient
technical
aid
to
the
dissemination
of
interest
in
an
important
and
difficult
field
it
is
also
worthy
of
mention
that
at
the
university
of
graz
he
has
established
a
museum
of
criminology
and
that
his

may
be
accepted
as
an
authoritative
exposition
of
a

is
the
more
acceptable
for
purposes
of

in
that
the

preface
to
the
american
edition
the
present
work
was
the
first
really
objective
criminal
psychology
which
dealt
with
the
mental
states
of
judges
experts
jury
witnesses
as
well
as
with
the
mental
states
of
criminals
and
a
study
of
the
former
is
just
as
needful
as
a
study
of
the
latter
the
need
has
fortunately
since
been
recognized
and
several
studies
of
special
topics
treated
in
this
book
depositions
of
witnesses
perception
the
pathoformic
lie
superstition
probability
sensory
illusions
inference
sexual
differences
have
become
the
subjects
of
a
considerable
literature
referred
to
in
our
second
edition
i
agreed
with
much
pleasure
to
the
proposition
of
the
american
institute
of
criminal
law
and
criminology
to
have
the
book
translated
i
am
proud
of
the
opportunity
to
address
americans
and
englishmen
in
their
language
we
of
the
german
countries
recognize
the
intellectual
achievements
of
america
and
are
well
aware
how
much
americans
can
teach
us
i
can
only
hope
that
the
translation
will
justify
itself
by
its
usefulness
to
the
legal
profession
hans
gross
note
the
present
version
of
kriminal
psychologie
differs
from
the
original
in
the
fact
that
many
references
not
of
general
psychological
or
criminological
interest
or
not
readily
accessible
to
english
readers
have
been
eliminated
and
in
some
instances
more
accessible
ones
have
been
inserted
erudition
is
so
stupendous
that
it
reaches
far
out
into
texts
where
no
ordinary
reader
would
be
able
or
willing
to
follow
him
and
the
book
suffers
no
loss
from
the
excision
in
other
places
it
was
necessary
to
omit
or
to
condense
passages
wherever
this
is
done
attention
is
called
to
it
in
the
notes
the
chief
omission
is
a
portion
of
the
section
on
dialects
otherwise
the
translation
is
practically
literal
additional

criminal
psychology
introduction
of
all
disciplines
necessary
to
the
criminal
justice
in
addition
to
the
knowledge
of
law
the
most
important
are
those
derived
from
psychology
for
such
sciences
teach
him
to
know
the
type
of
man
it
is
his
business
to
deal
with
now
psychological
sciences
appear
in
various
forms
there
is
a
native
psychology
a
keenness
of
vision
given
in
the
march
of
experience
to
a
few
fortunate
persons
who
see
rightly
without
having
learned
the
laws
which
determine
the
course
of
events
or
without
being
even
conscious
of
them
of
this
native
psychological
power
many
men
show
traces
but
very
few
indeed
are
possessed
of
as
much
as
criminalists
intrinsically
require
in
the
colleges
and
schools
we
jurists
may
acquire
a
little
scientific
psychology
as
a
propaedeutic
but
we
all
know
how
insufficient
it
is
and
how
little
of
it
endures
in
the
business
of
life
and
we
had
rather
not
reckon
up
the
number
of
criminalists
who
seeing
this
insufficiency
pursue
serious
psychological
investigations
one
especial
psychological
discipline
which
was
apparently
created
for
our
sake
is
the
psychology
of
law
the
development
of
which
in
germany
volkmar
recounts
this
science
afterward
developed
through
the
instrumentality
of
metzger
and
plainer
as
criminal
psychology
from
the
medical
point
of
view
especially
collection
of
the
is
still
valuable
criminal
psychology
was
developed
further
by
hoffbauer
grohmann
heinroth
schaumann
m√ºnch
eckartshausen
and
others
in
time
the
subject
was
a
bone
of
contention
between
faculties
kant
representing
in
the
quarrel
the
philosophic
metzger
hoffbauer
and
fries
the
medical
faculties
later
legal
psychology
was
simply
absorbed
by
psychiatry
and
thereby
completely
subsumed
among
the
medical
disciplines
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
regnault
still
later
attempted
to
recover
it
for
philosophy
as
is
pointed
out
in
cf
moreover
nowadays
criminal
psychology
as
represented
by
kraus
maudsley
holtzendorff
lombroso
and
others
has
become
a
branch
of
criminal
anthropology
it
is
valued
as
the
doctrine
of
motives
in
crime
or
according
to
liszt
as
the
investigation
of
the
psychophysical
condition
of
the
criminal
it
is
thus
only
a
part
of
the
subject
indicated
by
its
name
how
utterly
criminal
psychology
has
become
incorporated
in
criminal
anthropology
is
demonstrated
by
the
works
of
n√§cke
kurella
bleuler
dallemagne
marro
ellis
baer
koch
maschka
thomson
ferri
bonfigli
corre
etc
literally
criminal
psychology
should
be
form
of
psychology
used
in
dealing
with
not
merely
the
psychopathology
of
criminals
the
natural
history
of
the
criminal
mind
but
taken
even
literally
this
is
not
all
the
psychology
required
by
the
criminalist
no
doubt
crime
is
an
objective
thing
cain
would
actually
have
slaughtered
abel
even
if
at
the
time
adam
and
eve
were
already
dead
but
for
us
each
crime
exists
only
as
we
perceive
it
as
we
learn
to
know
it
through
all
those
media
established
for
us
in
criminal
procedure
but
these
media
are
based
upon
upon
the
perception
of
the
judge
and
his
assistants
upon
witnesses
accused
and
experts
such
perceptions
must
be
psychologically
validated
the
knowledge
of
the
principles
of
this
validation
demands
again
a
special
department
of
general
psychology
even
such
a
applied
psychology
as
will
deal
with
all
states
of
mind
that
might
possibly
be
involved
in
the
determination
and
judgment
of
it
is
the
aim
of
this
book
to
present
such
a
psychology
we
were
gods
writes
plato
in
the
symposium
would
be
no
and
if
our
senses
were
truer
and
our
sense
keener
we
should
need
no
psychology
as
it
is
we
must
strive
hard
to
determine
certainly
how
we
see
and
think
we
must
understand
these
processes
according
to
valid
laws
organized
into
a
system
otherwise
we
remain
the
shuttlecocks
of
sense
misunderstanding
and
accident
we
must
know
how
all
of
us
we
ourselves
witnesses
experts
and
accused
observe
and
perceive
we
must
know
how
they
think
and
how
they
demonstrate
we
must
take
into
account
how
variously
mankind
infer
and
perceive
what
mistakes
and
illusions
may
ensue
how
people
recall
and
bear
in
mind
how
everything
varies
with
age
sex
nature
and
cultivation
we
must
also
see
clearly
what
series
of
influences
can
prevail
to
change
all
those
things
which
would
have
been
different
under
normal
conditions
indeed
the
largest
place
in
this
book
will
be
given
to
the
witness
and
the
judge
himself
since
we
want
in
fact
from
the
first
to
keep
in
mind
the
creation
of
material
for
our
instruction
but
the
psychology
of
the
criminal
must
also
receive
consideration
the
issue
is
not
concerned
with
his
psychoses
but
with
the
validation
of
evidence
our
method
will
be
that
fundamental
to
all
psychological
investigation
and
may
be
divided
into
three
parts
the
preparation
of
a
review
of
psychological
phenomena
study
of
causal
relationships
establishment
of
the
principles
of
psychic
activity
the
will
be
drawn
on
the
one
hand
from
that
already
presented
by
psychological
science
but
will
be
treated
throughout
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
criminal
judge
and
prepared
for
his
purposes
on
the
other
hand
the
material
will
be
drawn
from
these
observations
that
alone
the
criminologist
at
work
can
make
and
on
this
the
principles
of
psychology
will
be
brought
to
bear
we
shall
not
espouse
either
pietism
scepticism
or
criticism
we
have
merely
to
consider
the
individual
phenomena
as
they
may
concern
the
criminalist
to
examine
them
and
to
establish
whatever
value
the
material
may
have
for
him
what
portions
may
be
of
use
to
him
in
the
interest
of
discovering
the
truth
and
where
the
dangers
may
lurk
that
menace
him
and
just
as
we
are
aware
that
the
comprehension
of
the
fundamental
concepts
of
the
exact
sciences
is
not
to
be
derived
from
their
methodology
so
we
must
keep
clearly
in
mind
that
the
truth
which
we
criminalists
have
to
attain
can
not
be
constructed
out
of
the
correctness
of
the
content
presented
us
we
are
in
duty
bound
to
render
it
correct
but
that
is
to
be
achieved
only
if
we
are
acquainted
with
principles
of
psychology
and
know
how
to
make
them
serve
our
purposes
for
our
problem
the
epigram
of
study
of
physiology
is
as
repugnant
to
the
psychologist
as
that
of
acoustics
to
the
composer
no
longer
holds
we
are
not
poets
we
are
investigators
if
we
are
to
do
our
work
properly
we
must
base
it
completely
upon
modern
psycho
physical
fundamentals
whoever
expects
unaided
to
find
the
right
thing
at
the
right
moment
is
in
the
position
of
the
individual
who
know
whether
he
could
play
the
violin
because
he
had
not
yet
tried
we
must
gather
wisdom
while
we
are
not
required
to
use
it
when
the
time
for
use
arrives
the
time
for
harvest
is
over
let
this
be
our
fundamental
principle
we
criminalists
receive
from
our
main
source
the
witnesses
many
more
inferences
than
and
that
this
fact
is
the
basis
of
so
many
mistakes
in
our
work
again
and
again
we
are
taught
in
the
deposition
of
evidence
that
only
facts
as
plain
should
be
presented
that
inference
is
the
affair
but
we
only
appear
to
obey
this
principle
actually
most
of
what
we
note
as
fact
and
is
nothing
but
a
more
or
less
justified
judgment
which
though
presented
in
the
honestest
belief
still
offers
no
positive
truth
plato
sed
magis
amica
there
is
no
doubt
that
there
is
an
increasing
and
for
us
jurists
a
not
unimportant
demand
for
the
study
of
psychology
in
its
bearing
on
our
profession
but
it
must
be
served
the
spirited
abb√©
de
ba√´ts
said
at
a
meeting
of
criminalists
in
brussels
that
the
tendency
of
the
science
of
criminal
law
demands
the
observation
of
the
facts
of
the
daily
in
this
observation
consists
the
alpha
and
omega
of
our
work
we
can
perform
it
only
with
the
flux
of
sensory
appearances
and
the
law
which
determines
this
flux
and
according
to
which
the
appearances
come
is
the
law
of
causation
but
we
are
nowhere
so
neglectful
of
causation
as
in
the
deeds
of
mankind
a
knowledge
of
that
region
only
psychology
can
give
us
hence
to
become
conversant
with
psychological
principles
is
the
obvious
duty
of
that
conscientiousness
which
must
hold
first
place
among
the
forces
that
conserve
the
state
it
is
a
fact
that
there
has
been
in
this
matter
much
delinquency
and
much
neglect
if
then
we
were
compelled
to
endure
some
bitterness
on
account
of
it
let
it
be
remembered
that
it
was
always
directed
upon
the
fact
that
we
insisted
on
studying
our
statutes
and
their
commentaries
fearfully
excluding
every
other
discipline
that
might
have
assisted
us
and
have
imported
vitality
into
our
profession
it
was
gneist
who
complained
contemporary
low
stage
of
legal
education

to
be
explained

much
else
by
that
historical

foremost
r√¥le

mention
so
plainly
but
he
points
sternly
enough
to
the
legal
sciences
as
the
most
backward
of
all
disciplines
that
were
in
contact
with
contemporary
tendencies
that
these
accusations
are
justified
we
must
admit
when
we
consider
what
st√∂lzel
and
the
genial
creator
of
modern
civil
teaching
demands
must
be
recognized
that
jurisprudence
in
reality
is
nothing
but
the
thesis
of
the
healthy
human
understanding
in
matters
of
but
what
the
human
requires
we
can
no
longer
discover
from
our
statutory
paragraphs
only
how
shameful
it
is
for
us
when
goldschmidt
openly
narrates
how
a
famous
scientist
exclaimed
to
a
student
in
his
laboratory
do
you
want
here
you
know
nothing
you
understand
nothing
you
do
nothing
you
had
better
become
a
now
let
us
for
once
frankly
confess
why
we
are
dealt
these
disgraceful
reproaches
let
us
agree
that
we
have
not
studied
or
dealt
with
jurisprudence
as
a
science
have
never
envisaged
it
as
an
empirical
discipline
that
the
aprioristic
and
classical
tradition
had
kept
this
insight
at
a
distance
and
that
where
investigation
and
effort
toward
the
recognition
of
the
true
is
lacking
there
lacks
everything
of
the
least
scientific
importance
to
be
scientifically
legitimate
we
need
first
of
all
the
installation
of
the
disciplines
of
research
which
shall
have
direct
relationships
with
our
proper
task
in
this
way
only
can
we
attain
that
spiritual
independence
by
means
of
spiritual
freedom
which
goldschmidt
defines
as
the
affair
of
the
higher
institutions
of
learning
and
which
is
also
the
ideal
of
our
own
business
in
life
and
this
task

not
too

the
thinking
which
comes
in
the
fullness
of
it
may
be
announced
with
joy
and
satisfaction
that
since
the
publication
of
the
first
edition
of
this
book
and
bearing
upon
it
there
came
to
life
a
rich
collection
of
fortuitous
works
which
have
brought
together
valuable
material
concerning
the
testimony
of
witnesses
its
nature
and
value
concerning
memory
and
the
types
of
reproduction
there
is
now
a
considerable
literature
everywhere
industrious
hands
are
raised

of
psychologists
physicians
and
lawyers
to
share
in
the
work
should
they
go
on
unhurt
we
may
perhaps
repair
the
unhappy
faults
committed
by
our

stupid

socrates
dealing
in
the
meno
with
the
teachability
of
virtue
sends
for
one
of
slaves
to
prove
by
him
the
possibility
of
absolutely
certain
a
priori
knowledge
the
slave
is
to
determine
the
length
of
a
rectangle
the
contents
of
which
is
twice
that
of
one
measuring
two
feet
but
he
is
to
have
no
previous
knowledge
of
the
matter
and
is
not
to
be
directly
coached
by
socrates
he
is
to
discover
the
answer
for
himself
actually
the
slave
first
gives
out
an
incorrect
answer
he
answers
that
the
length
of
a
rectangle
having
twice
the
area
of
the
one
mentioned
is
four
feet
thinking
that
the
length
doubles
with
the
area
thereupon
socrates
triumphantly
points
out
to
meno
that
the
slave
does
as
a
matter
of
fact
not
yet
quite
know
the
truth
under
consideration
but
that
he
really
thinks
he
knows
it
and
then
socrates
in
his
own
socratic
way
leads
the
slave
to
the
correct
solution
this
very
significant
procedure
of
the
philosopher
is
cited
by
guggenheim
as
an
illustration
of
the
essence
of
a
priori
knowledge
and
when
we
properly
consider
what
we
have
to
do
with
a
witness
who
has
to
relate
any
fact
we
may
see
in
the
socratic
method
the
simplest
example
of
our
task
we
must
never
forget
the
majority
of
mankind
dealing
with
any
subject
whatever
always
believe
that
they
know
and
repeat
the
and
even
when
they
say
doubtfully
it
seems
to
me
there
is
in
this
tentativeness
more
meant
than
meets
the
ear
when
anybody
says
believe
that
it
merely
means
that
he
intends
to
insure
himself
against
the
event
of
being
contradicted
by
better
informed
persons
but
he
certainly
has
not
the
doubt
his
expression
indicates
when
however
the
report
of
some
bare
fact
is
in
question
rained
was
beard
was
brown
or
was
it
does
not
matter
to
the
narrator
and
if
he
imparts
facts
with
the
introduction
believe
then
he
was
really
uncertain
the
matter
becomes
important
only
where
the
issue
involves
observations
conclusions
and
judgments
in
such
cases
another
factor
enters
conceit
what
the
witness
asserts
he
is
fairly
certain
of
just
because
he
asserts
it
and
all
the
believes
and
seemeds
are
merely
insurance
against
all
accidents
generally
statements
are
made
without
such
reservations
and
even
if
the
matter
is
not
long
certain
with
full
assurance
what
thus
holds
of
the
daily
life
holds
also
and
more
intensely
of
particularly
in
crucial
matters
anybody
experienced
in
their
conduct
comes
to
be
absolutely
convinced
that
witnesses
do
not
know
what
they
know
a
series
of
assertions
are
made
with
utter
certainty
yet
when
these
are
successively
subjected
to
closer
examinations
tested
for
their
ground
and
source
only
a
very
small
portion
can
be
retained
unaltered
of
course
one
may
here
overshoot
the
mark
it
often
happens
even
in
the
routine
of
daily
life
that
a
man
may
be
made
to
feel
shaky
in
his
most
absolute
convictions
by
means
of
an
energetic
attack
and
searching
questions
conscientious
and
sanguine
people
are
particularly
easy
subjects
of
such
doubts
somebody
narrates
an
event
questioning
begins
as
to
the
indubitability
of
the
fact
as
to
the
exclusion
of
possible
deception
the
narrator
becomes
uncertain
he
recalls
that
because
of
a
lively
imagination
he
has
already
believed
himself
to
have
seen
things
otherwise
than
they
actually
were
and
finally
he
admits
that
the
matter
might
probably
have
been
different
during
trials
this
is
still
more
frequent
the
circumstance
of
being
in
court
of
itself
excites
most
people
the
consciousness
that
statement
is
or
may
be
of
great
significance
increases
the
excitement
and
the
authoritative
character
of
the
official
subdues
very
many
people
to
conform
their
opinions
to
his
what
wonder
then
that
however
much
a
man
may
be
convinced
of
the
correctness
of
his
evidence
he
may
yet
fail
in
the
face
of
the
doubting
judge
to
know
anything
certainly
now
one
of
the
most
difficult
tasks
of
the
criminalist
is
to
hit
in
just
such
cases
upon
the
truth
neither
to
accept
the
testimony
blindly
and
uncritically
nor
to
render
the
witness
who
otherwise
is
telling
the
truth
vacillating
and
doubtful
but
it
is
still
more
difficult
to
lead
the
witness
who
is
not
intentionally
falsifying
but
has
merely
observed
incorrectly
or
has
made
false
conclusions
to
a
statement
of
the
truth
as
socrates
leads
the
slave
in
the
meno
it
is
as
modern
as
it
is
comfortable
to
assert
that
this
is
not
the
business
that
the
witness
is
to
depose
his
evidence
is
to
be
accepted
and
the
judge
is
to
judge
yet
it
is
supposed
before
everything
else
that
the
duty
of
the
court
is
to
establish
the
material
truth
that
the
formal
truth
is
insufficient
moreover
if
we
notice
false
observations
and
let
them
by
then
under
certain
circumstance
we
are
minus
one
important
piece
of
evidence
and
and
the
whole
case
may
be
turned
topsy
turvy
at
the
very
least
a
basis
of
development
in
the
presentation
of
evidence
is
so
excluded
we
shall
then
proceed
in
the
socratic
fashion
but
inasmuch
as
we
are
not
concerned
with
mathematics
and
are
hence
more
badly
placed
in
the
matter
of
proof
we
shall
have
to
proceed
more
cautiously
and
with
less
certainty
than
when
the
question
is
merely
one
of
the
area
of
a
square
on
the
one
hand
we
know
only
in
the
rarest
cases
that
we
are
not
ourselves
mistaken
so
that
we
must
not
without
anything
further
lead
another
to
agree
with
us
on
the
other
hand
we
must
beware
of
perverting
the
witness
from
his
possibly
sound
opinions
it
is
not
desirable
to
speak
of
suggestion
in
this
matter
since
if
i
believe
that
the
other
fellow
knows
a
matter
better
than
i
and
conform
to
his
opinion
there
is
as
yet
no
suggestion
and
this
pure
form
of
change
of
opinion
and
of
openness
to
conviction
is
commonest
among
us
whoever
is
able
to
correct
the
apparently
false
conceptions
and
to
lead
him
to
discover
his
error
of
his
own
accord
and
then
to
speak
the
truth
whoever
can
do
this
and
yet
does
not
go
too
far
deducing
from
the
facts
nothing
that
does
not
actually
follow
from
that
man
is
a
master
among
us
section
b
the
method
of
natural
science
if
now
we
ask
how
we
are
to
plan
our
work
what
method
we
are
to
follow
we
must
agree
that
to
establish
scientifically
the
principles
of
our
discipline
alone
is
not
sufficient
if
we
are
to
make
progress
the
daily
routine
also
must
be
scientifically
administered
every
sentence
every
investigation
every
official
act
must
satisfy
the
same
demand
as
that
made
of
the
entire
juristic
science
in
this
way
only
can
we
rise
above
the
mere
workaday
world
of
manual
labor
with
its
disgust
its
vexatious
monotony
and
its
frightful
menace
against
law
and
justice
while
jurists
merely
studied
the
language
of
dead
laws
expounding
them
with
effort
unceasing
and
one
may
complain
propounding
more
we
must
have
despaired
of
ever
being
scientific
and
this
because
law
as
a
science
painfully
sought
justification
in
deduction
from
long
obsolete
norms
and
in
the
explanation
of
texts
to
jurisprudence
was
left
only
the
empty
shell
and
a
man
like
ihering
spoke
of
a
for
yet
the
scientific
quality
is
right
to
hand
we
need
only
to
take
hold
of
the
method
that
for
nearly
a
century
has
shown
itself
to
us
the
most
helpful
since
warnk√∂nig
told
us
must
become
a
natural
science
men
have
rung
changes
upon
this
battle
cry
cf
spitzer
and
even
if
because
misunderstood
it
led
in
some
directions
wrongly
it
does
seem
as
if
a
genuinely
scientific
direction
might
be
given
to
our
doctrines
and
their
application
we
know
very
well
that
we
may
not
hurry
wherever
people
delayed
in
establishing
the
right
thing
and
then
suddenly
tried
for
it
they
went
in
their
haste
too
far
this
is
apparent
not
only
in
the
situations
of
life
it
is
visible
in
the
very
recent
hasty
conclusions
of
the
lombrosists
in
their
very
good
but
inadequate
observations
and
unjustified
and
strained
inferences
we
are
not
to
figure
the
scientific
method
from
these
it
is
for
us
to
gather
facts
and
to
study
them
the
drawing
of
inferences
we
may
leave
to
our
more
fortunate
successors
but
in
the
daily
routine
we
may
vary
this
procedure
a
little
we
draw
there
inferences
from
correct
and
simple
observations
facts
to
ideas
says
√∂ttingen
world
has
for
several
millenniums
tried
to
subdue
matter
to
preconceptions
and
the
world
has
failed
now
the
procedure
is
facts
to
there
lies
our
road
let
us
for
once
observe
the
facts
of
life
without
prejudice
without
maxims
built
on
preconceptions
let
us
establish
them
strip
them
of
all
alien
character
then
finally
when
we
find
nothing
more
in
the
least
doubtful
we
may
theorize
about
them
and
draw
inferences
modestly
and
with
caution
every
fundamental
investigation
must
first
of
all
establish
the
nature
of
its
subject
matter
this
is
the
maxim
of
a
book
die
one
of
the
wisest
ever
written
the
same
axiomatic
proposition
must
dominate
every
legal
task
but
especially
every
task
of
criminal
law
it
is
possible
to
read
thousands
upon
thousands
of
testimonies
and
to
make
again
this
identical
fatiguing
contrary
observation
the
two
witness
and
judge
have
not
defined
the
nature
of
this
subject
they
have
not
determined
what
they
wanted
of
each
other
the
one
spoke
of
one
matter
the
other
of
another
but
just
what
the
thing
really
was
that
was
to
have
been
established
the
one
did
not
know
and
the
other
did
not
tell
him
but
the
blame
for
this
defective
formulation
does
not
rest
with
the
witness
formulation
was
the
other
business
when
the
real
issue
is
defined
the
essentially
modern
and
scientific
investigation
begins
ebbinghaus
i
believe
has
for
our
purpose
defined
it
best
it
consists
in
trying
to
keep
constant
the
complex
of
conditions
demonstrated
to
be
necessary
for
the
realization
of
a
given
effect
it
consists
in
varying
these
conditions
in
isolating
one
from
the
other
in
a
numerically
determinable
order
and
finally
in
establishing
the
accompanying
changes
with
regard
to
the
effect
in
a
quantified
or
countable
order
i
can
not
here
say
anything
further
to
show
that
this
is
the
sole
correct
method
of
establishing
the
necessary
principles
of
our
science
the
aim
is
only
to
test
the
practicality
of
this
method
in
the
routine
of
a
criminal
case
and
to
see
if
it
is
not
indeed
the
only
one
by
which
to
attain
complete
and
indubitable
results
if
it
is
it
must
of
not
only
during
the
whole
trial
not
only
in
the
testing
of
collected
evidence
but
also
in
the
testing
of
every
individual
portion
thereof
analyzed
into
its
component
elements
let
us
first
consider
the
whole
trial
the
is
here
the
evidence
of
guilt
the
complex
conditions
for
its
establishment
are
the
collective
instruments
in
getting
evidence
the
individual
conditions
are
to
be
established
by
means
of
the
individual
sources
of
evidence
testimony
of
witnesses
examination
of
the
premises
obduction
protocol
etc
constantification
of
now
consists
in
standardizing
the
present
instance
thus
whenever
similar
circumstances
are
given
the
same
instruments
of
evidence
are
present
the
evidence
of
guilt
is
established
now
the
accompanying
changes
with
regard
to
the
effect
proof
of
guilt
through
evidence
have
to
be
tested
therefore
the
individual
conditions
the
individual
sources
of
evidence
have
to
be
established
and
their
values
to
be
determined
and
finally
the
accompanying
change
in
effect
conviction
by
evidence
is
to
be
tested
the
last
procedure
requires
discussion
the
rest
is
self
evident
in
our
business
isolation
is
comparatively
easy
inasmuch
as
any
individual
statement
any
visual
impression
any
effect
may
be
abstracted
without
difficulty
much
harder
is
the
determination
of
its
value
if
however
we
clearly
recognize
that
it
is
necessary
to
express
the
exact
value
of
each
particular
source
of
evidence
and
that
the
task
is
only
to
determine
comparative
valuation
the
possibility
of
such
a
thing
in
at
least
a
sufficiently
close
degree
of
certainty
must
be
granted
the
valuation
must
be
made
in
respect
of
two
things
its
subjective
and
relative
its
objective
and
absolute
on
the
one
hand
the
value
of
the
evidence
itself
must
be
tested
according
to
the
appraisement
of
the
person
who
presents
it
and
of
the
conditions
under
which
he
is
important
on
the
other
what
influence
evidence
accepted
as
reliable
can
exercise
upon
the
considered
in
and
for
itself
so
then
when
a
testimony
is
being
considered
it
must
first
be
determined
whether
the
witness
was
able
and
willing
to
speak
the
truth
and
further
what
the
importance
of
the
testimony
may
be
in
terms
of
the
changes
it
may
cause
in
the
of
the
case
of
greatest
importance
and
most
difficult
is
the
variation
of
conditions
and
the
establishment
of
the
changes
thereby
generated
with
regard
to
the
the
critical
interpretation
of
the
material
in
hand
applied
to
a
case
the
problem
presents
itself
in
this
wise
i
consider
each
detail
of
evidence
by
itself
and
cleared
of
all
others
and
i
vary
it
as
often
as
it
is
objectively
possible
to
do
so
thus
i
suppose
that
each
statement
of
the
witness
might
be
a
lie
entirely
or
in
part
it
might
be
incorrect
observation
false
inference
and
then
i
ask
myself
does
the
evidence
of
guilt
the
establishment
of
an
especial
trial
now
remain
just
if
not
is
it
just
under
other
and
related
possible
circumstances
am
i
in
possession
of
these
circumstances
if
now
the
degree
of
apparent
truth
is
so
far
tested
that
these
variations
may
enter
and
the
accusation
still
remain
just
the
defendant
is
convicted
but
only
under
these
circumstances
the
same
procedure
here
required
for
the
conduct
of
a
complete
trial
is
to
be
followed
also
in
miniature
in
the
production
of
particulars
of
evidence
let
us
again
construe
an
instance
the
now
is
the
establishment
of
the
objective
correctness
of
some
particular
point
made
by
statements
of
witnesses
looks
the
of
consists
in
the
collection
of
these
influences
which
might
render
doubtful
the
correctness
dishonesty
of
witnesses
defective
examination
of
locality
unreliability
of
the
object
ignorance
of
experts
etc
it
is
necessary
to
know
clearly
which
of
these
influences
might
be
potent
in
the
case
in
hand
and
to
what
degree
the
consists
also
this
time
in
the
comparison
of
the
conditions
of
the
present
case
with
those
of
other
cases
the
again
consists
in
the
abstraction
from
the
evidence
of
those
details
which
might
possibly
be
incorrect
thus
correcting
it
from
various
points
of
view
and
finally
in
observing
the
as
it
defines
itself
under
this
variety
of
formulation
this
procedure
adopted
in
the
preparation
and
judgment
of
each
new
piece
of
evidence
excludes
error
as
far
as
our
means
conceivably
permit
only
one
thing
more
is
needful
a
narrow
and
minute
research
into
that
order
of
succession
which
is
of
indispensable
importance
in
every
natural
science
all
truths
concerning
natural
phenomena
those
which
deal
with
the
order
of
succession
are
for
us
the
most
important
upon
a
knowledge
of
them
is
grounded
every
intelligent
anticipation
of
the
s
mill
the
oversight
of
this
doctrine
is
the
largest
cause
of
our
failures
we
must
in
the
determination
of
evidence
cleave
to
it
whenever
the
question
of
influence
upon
the
is
raised
the
problem
of
order
is
found
invariably
the
most
important
mistakes
and
impossibilities
are
in
the
main
discovered
only
when
the
examination
of
the
order
of
succession
has
been
undertaken
in
short
we
have
confined
ourselves
long
enough
to
the
mere
study
of
our
legal
canons
we
now
set
out
upon
an
exact
consideration
of
their
material
to
do
this
obviously
demands
a
retreat
to
the
and
a
beginning
we
ought
to
have
made
long
ago
but
natural
sciences
on
which
we
model
ourselves
have
had
to
do
the
identical
thing
and
are
now
at
it
openly
and
honestly

of

determine
his
work

these
are
the
most
pregnant
of

his
success

on
his
skill
his
tact
his
knowledge
of
human
nature

patience

his
propriety

anybody
who
takes
the
trouble
may
note
speedily
the
great
differences
in
efficiency
between
those
who
do
and
those
who
do
not
possess
such
qualities
that
they
are
important
to
witnesses
and
accused
is
undoubted
but
this
importance
is
manifest
to
still
others
the
intercourse
between
various
examining
judges
and
experts
is
a
matter
of
daily
observation
one
judge
puts
the
question
according
to
law
and
expects
to
be
respected
he
does
not
make
explicit
how
perfectly
indifferent
the
whole
affair
is
to
him
but
experts
have
sufficient
opportunity
to
take
note
of
that
fact
the
other
narrates
the
case
explains
to
the
experts
its
various
particular
possibilities
finds
out
whether
and
what
further
elucidation
they
demand
perhaps
inquires
into
the
intended
manner
and
method
of
the
expert
solution
of
the
problem
informs
himself
of
the
case
by
their
means
and
manifests
especial
interest
in
the
difficult
and
far
too
much
neglected
work
of
the
experts
it
may
be
said
that
the
latter
will
do
their
work
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
with
the
same
result
this
would
be
true
if
unfortunately
experts
were
not
also
endowed
with
the
same
imperfections
as
other
mortals
and
are
thus
far
also
infected
by
interest
or
indifference
just
imagine
that
besides
the
examining
magistrate
of
a
great
superior
court
every
justice
and
in
addition
all
the
chiefs
and
officials
manifested
equal
indifference
then
even
the
most
devoted
experts
would
grow
cool
and
do
only
what
they
absolutely
had
to
but
if
all
the
members
of
the
same
court
are
actuated
by
the
same
keen
interest
and
comport
themselves
as
described
how
different
the
affair
becomes
it
would
be
impossible
that
even
the
indifferent
and
perhaps
least
industrious
experts
should
not
be
carried
out
of
themselves
by
the
general
interest
should
not
finally
realize
the
importance
of
their
position
and
do
their
utmost
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
president
the
jurymen
and
their
it
is
observable
that
here
and
there
a
presiding
justice
succeeds
in
boring
all
concerned
during
even
criminal
cases
interesting
in
themselves
the
incident
drags
on
and
people
are
interested
only
in
finally
seeing
the
end
of
the
matter
other
presiding
justices
again
fortunately
the
majority
understand
how
to
impart
apparent
importance
to
even
the
simplest
case
whatever
office
anybody
may
hold
he
and
his
mates
are
commissioned
in
the
common
task
and
should
the
thing
come
up
for
judgment
everybody
does
his
best
the
difference
here
is
not
due
to
temperamental
freshness
or
tediousness
the
result
depends
only
upon
a
correct
or
incorrect
psychological
handling
of
the
participants
the
latter
must
in
every
single
case
be
led
and
trained
anew
to
interest
conscientiousness
and
in
this
need
lies
the
educational
opportunity
of
the
criminal
judge
whether
it
arises
with
regard
to
the
accused
the
witness
the
associate
justice
or
the
expert
is
all
one
it
is
invariably
the
same
that
knowledge
of
human
nature
is
for
this
purpose
most
important
to
the
criminalist
will
be
as
little
challenged
as
the
circumstance
that
such
knowledge
can
not
be
acquired
from
books
curiously
enough
there
are
not
a
few
on
the
subject
but
i
suspect
that
whoever
studies
or
memorizes
them
such
books
as
and
others
enumerated
by
volkmar
will
have
gained
little
that
is
of
use
a
knowledge
of
human
nature
is
acquired
only
barring
of
course
a
certain
talent
thereto
by
persevering
observation
comparison
summarization
and
further
comparison
so
acquired
it
sets
its
possessor
to
the
fore
and
makes
him
independent
of
a
mass
of
information
with
which
the
others
have
to
repair
their
ignorance
of
mankind
this
is
to
be
observed
in
countless
cases
in
our
profession
whoever
has
had
to
deal
with
certain
sorts
of
swindlers
lying
horsetraders
antiquarians
prestidigitators
soon
comes
to
the
remarkable
conclusion
that
of
this
class
exactly
those
who
flourish
most
in
their
profession
and
really
get
rich
understand
their
trade
the
least
the
is
no
connoisseur
whatever
in
horses
the
antiquarian
can
not
judge
the
value
nor
the
age
and
excellence
of
antiquities
the
knows
a
few
stupid
tricks
with
which
one
might
think
he
ought
to
be
able
to
deceive
only
the
most
innocent
persons
nevertheless
they
all
have
comfortable
incomes
and
merely
because
they
know
their
fellows
and
have
practised
this
knowledge
with
repeatedly
fresh
applications
i
do
not
of
course
assert
that
we
criminalists
need
little
scholarly
knowledge
of
law
and
ought
to
depend
entirely
upon
knowledge
of
men
we
need
exactly
as
much
more
knowledge
as
our
task
exceeds
that
of
the
but
we
can
not
do
without
knowledge
of
humanity
the
immense
onerousness
of
the
office
lies
in
just
the
fact
that
he
needs
so
very
much
more
than
his
bare
legal
knowledge
he
must
before
all
things
be
a
jurist
and
not
merely
a
criminalist
he
must
be
in
full
possession
not
only
of
the
knowledge
he
has
acquired
in
his
academy
but
of
the
very
latest
status
of
his
entire
science
if
he
neglects
the
purely
theoretical
he
degenerates
into
a
mere
laborer
he
is
in
duty
bound
not
only
to
make
himself
familiar
with
hundreds
of
things
to
be
able
to
consort
with
all
sorts
of
crafts
and
trades
but
also
finally
to
form
so
much
out
of
the
material
supplied
him
by
the
law
as
is
possible
to
human
power
section
b
integrity
of
witnesses
one
of
the
criminal
grossest
derelictions
from
duty
consists
in
his
simply
throwing
the
witness
the
question
and
in
permitting
him
to
say
what
he
chooses
if
he
contents
himself
in
that
he
leaves
to
the
conscience
the
telling
of
the
truth
and
the
whole
truth
the
witness
is
in
such
a
case
certainly
responsible
for
one
part
of
the
untruthful
and
suppressed
but
the
responsibility
for
the
other
and
larger
part
lies
with
the
judge
who
has
failed
to
do
his
best
to
bring
out
the
uttermost
value
of
the
evidence
indifferently
for
or
against
the
prisoner
the
work
of
education
is
intended
for
this
purpose
not
as
might
be
supposed
for
training
the
populace
as
a
whole
into
good
witnesses
but
to
make
that
individual
into
a
good
trustworthy
witness
who
is
called
upon
to
testify
for
the
first
and
perhaps
for
the
last
time
in
his
life
this
training
must
in
each
case
take
two
directions
it
must
make
him
to
tell
the
truth
it
must
make
him
to
tell
the
truth
the
first
requirement
deals
not
only
with
the
lie
alone
it
deals
with
the
development
of
complete
conscientiousness
how
to
face
the
lie
itself
can
not
be
determined
by
means
of
training
but
conscientious
answers
under
examination
can
certainly
be
so
acquired
we
are
not
here
considering
people
to
whom
truth
is
an
utter
stranger
who
are
fundamentally
liars
and
whose
very
existence
is
a
libel
on
mankind
we
consider
here
only
those
people
who
have
been
unaccustomed
to
speaking
the
full
and
unadulterated
truth
who
have
contented
themselves
throughout
their
lives
with
and
have
never
had
the
opportunity
of
learning
the
value
of
veracity
it
may
be
said
that
a
disturbingly
large
number
of
people
are
given
to
wandering
in
conversation
and
in
the
reproduction
of
the
past
they
do
not
go
straight
quickly
and
openly
to
the
point
they
loiter
toward
it
i
do
not
reach
it
in

can
get
along
on
if
not
then
and
if
i
really
do
not
get
to
it
at

i
do
get
somewhere
such
people
have
not
homes
but
inns
if
they
are
not
in
one
place
another
will
do
these
persons
are
characterized
by
the
event
that
whenever
one
has
seen
their
loitering
and
puts
the
matter
to
them
with
just
anger
they
either
get
frightened
or
say
carelessly
i
thought
this
was
not
so
this
famine
of
conscience
this
indifference
to
truth
does
damage
in
our
profession
i
assert
that
it
does
immensely
greater
harm
than
obvious
falsehood
because
indeed
the
unvarnished
lie
is
much
more
easily
discoverable
than
the
probable
truth
which
is
still
untruth
moreover
lies
come
generally
from
people
with
regard
to
whom
one
is
for
one
reason
or
another
already
cautious
while
these
insinuating
approximations
are
made
by
people
who
are
not
mistrusted
at
all
the
lack
of
conscientiousness
is
common
to
all
ages
both
sexes
and
to
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
but
it
is
most
characteristically
frequent
and
sharply
defined
among
people
who
have
no
real
business
in
life
whoever
romances
in
the
daily
life
romances
when
he
ought
to
be
absolutely
truthful
the
most
dangerous
of
this
class
are
those
who
make
a
living
by
means
of
show
and
exhibition
they
are
not
conscienceless
because
they

nothing

to

belong
peddlers

merchants
certain

and
especially
prostitutes
cf
lombroso
all
these
people
follow
a
calling
perhaps
much
troubled
but
they
do
no
actual
work
and
have
chosen
their
profession
to
avoid
regular
actual
work
they
have
much
unoccupied
time
and
when
they
are
working
part
of
the
work
consists
of
gossip
part
of
loafing
about
or
of
a
use
of
the
hands
that
is
little
more
in
brief
since
they
loiter
about
and
make
a
profit
out
of
it
it
is
no
wonder
that
in
giving
evidence
they
also
loaf
and
bring
to
light
only
approximate
truth
nor
is
it
difficult
to
indicate
analogous
persons
in
the
higher
walks
of
life
the
most
hateful
and
most
dangerous
of
these
people
are
the
congenital
tramps
people
who
did
not
have
to
work
and
faithfully
pursued
the
opportunity
of
doing
nothing
whoever
does
not
recognize
that
the
world
has
no
place
for
idlers
and
that
life
on
earth
must
be
earned
by
labor
is
without
conscience
no
conscientious
testimony
need
be
expected
from
such
among
the
few
rules
without
exception
which
in
the
course
of
long
experience
the
criminalist
may
make
this
is
one
that
real
tramps
of
both
sexes
and
all
walks
of

will
never

the

the
substitution
of

essential

ones
is
always
the
most
difficult
of
the
tasks

the

no

it
is

to
be

there

what
with

off
and
to
require
brief
statements
that
is
silly
if
the
witness
is
wandering
on
purpose
as
many
a
prisoner
does
for
definite
reasons
of
his
own
he
will
spread
himself
still
more
as
he
recognizes
that
his
examiner
does
not
like
it
to
be
disagreeable
is
his
purpose
he
is
never
led
by
impatience
beyond
his
introduction
and
some
piece
of
evidence
is
lost
because
almost
every
accused
who
speaks
unintelligibly
on
purpose
says
too
much
in
the
course
of
his
speech
and
brings
things
to
light
that
no
effort
might
otherwise
have
attained
to
besides
whoever
is
making
a
purposely
testimony
does
not
want
to
say
anything
superfluous
and
if
he
actually
does
so
is
unaware
of
it
and
even
when
he
knows
that
he
is
talking
too
much
most
of
the
time
he
knows
it
from
the
impatient
looks
of
his
auditors
he
never
can
tell
just
what
exceeded
the
measure
if
then
he
is
asked
to
cut
it
short
he
remains
unmoved
or
at
most
begins
again
at
the
beginning
or
if
he
actually
condescends
he
omits
things
of
importance
perhaps
even
of
the
utmost
importance
nor
must
it
be
forgotten
that
at
least
a
large
proportion
of
such
people
who
are
brought
to
court
have
prepared
their
story
or
probably
blocked
it
out
in
the
rough
if
they
are
not
permitted
to
follow
their
plans
they
get
confused
and
nothing
coherent
or
is
discovered
and
generally
those
who
say
most
have
thought
their
testimony
over
before
those
who
merely
have
to
say
no
more
than
and
at
the
trial
do
not
reduce
the
little
they
are
going
to
say
to
any
great
order
that
is
done
only
by
such
as
have
a
story
to
tell
once
the
stream
of
talk
breaks
loose
it
is
best
allowed
to
flow
on
and
only
then
interrupted
with
appropriate
questions
when
it
threatens
to
become
exhausting
help
against
too
much
talk
can
be
found
in
one
direction
but
it
must
be
made
use
of
before
the
evil
begins
and
is
in
any
event
of
use
only
in
the
description
of
a
long
chain
of
events
a
great
brawl
there
if
one
has
been
put
in
complete
possession
of
the
whole
truth
through
one
or
more
witnesses
the
next
witness
may
be
told
where
x
entered
the
if
that
is
not
done
one
may
be
compelled
to
hear
all
the
witness
did
the
day
before
the
brawl
and
how
these
introductions
in
themselves
indifferent
have
led
to
the
event
but
if
you
set
the
subject
the
witness
simply
abandons
the
first
part
of
possibly
studied
testimony
without
thereby
losing
his
coherence
the
procedure
may
be
accurately
observed
the
witness
is
told
at
this
or
that
this
deliverance
is
generally
followed
by
a
pause
during
which
he
obviously
reviews
and
sets
aside
the
part
of
his
prepared
speech
dealing
with
the
events
preliminary
to
the
required
points
if
however
the
setting
of
a
starting
point
does
not
work
and
the
witness
says
he
must
begin
at
the
earlier
stage
let
him
do
so
otherwise
he
tries
so
hard
to
begin
according
to
request
that
unable
to
go
his
own
way
he
confuses
everything
the
patience
required
for
taking
testimony
is
needful
also
in
not
only
children
and
folk
but
also
bright
persons
often
answer
only
and
and
these
bare
answers
demand
a
patience
most
necessary
with
just
this
bareness
if
the
answers
are
to
be
pursued
for
some
time
and
consecutively
the
danger
of
impatience
is
the
more
obvious
inasmuch
as
everyone
recognizes
more
or
less
clearly
that
he
is
likely
to
set
the
reserved
witness
suggestive
questions
and
so
to
learn
things
that
the
witness
never
would
have
said
not
everybody
indeed
who
makes
monosyllabic
replies
in
court
has
this
nature
but
in
the
long
run
this
common
characteristic
is
manifest
and
these
laconic
people
are
really
not
able
to
deliver
themselves
connectedly
in
long
speeches
if
then
the
witness
has
made
only
the
shortest
replies
and
a
coherent
story
be
made
of
them
the
witness
will
when
his
testimony
is
read
to
him
often
not
notice
the
untruths
it
might
contain
he
is
so
little
accustomed
to
his
own
prolonged
discourse
that
at
most
he
wonders
at
his
excellent
speech
without
noticing
even
coarse
falsehoods
if
contrary
to
expectation
he
does
notice
them
he
is
too
chary
of
words
to
call
attention
to
them
assents
and
is
glad
to
see
the
torture
coming
to
an
end
hence
nothing
but
endless
patience
will
do
to
bring
the
laconic
witness
to
say
at
least
enough
to
make
his
information
coherent
even
though
brief
it
may
be
presented
in
this
form
for
protocol
section
d
presuppositions
of
one
of
the
most
important
rules
of
is
not
to
suppose
that
practically
any
witness
is
skilled
in
statement
of
what
he
remembers
even
of
child
training
fr√∂bel
says
must
be
drawn
out
not
and
this
is
the
more
valid
in
jurisprudence
and
the
more
difficult
since
the
lawyers
have
at
most
only
as
many
hours
with
the
individual
as
the
teacher
has
years
however
we
must
aim
to
draw
the
witness
out
and
if
it
does
not
work
at
first
we
must
nevertheless
not
despair
of
succeeding
the
chief
thing
is
to
determine
the
level
and
then
meet
him
on
it
we
certainly
can
not
succeed
in
the
short
time
allowed
us
to
raise
him
to
ours
object
of
says
lange
to
endow
the
pupil
with
more
apperceptive
capacity
to
make
him
intellectually
free
it
is
therefore
necessary
to
discover
his
thoughts
and
to
beware
of
expounding
too
this
is
not
a
little
true
the
development
of
apperceptive
capacity
is
not
so
difficult
for
us
inasmuch
as
our
problem
is
not
to
prepare
our
subject
for
life
but
for
one
present
purpose
if
we
desire
to
this
end
to
make
one
more
intellectually
free
we
have
only
to
get
him
to
consider
with
independence
the
matter
with
which
we
are
concerned
to
keep
him
free
of
all
alien
suggestions
and
inferences
and
to
compel
him
to
see
the
case
as
if
no
influences
personal
or
circumstantial
had
been
at
work
on
him
this
result
does
not
require
merely
the
setting
aside
of
special
influences
nor
the
setting
aside
of
all
that
others
have
said
to
him
on
the
matter
under
discussion
nor
the
elucidation
of
the
effect
of
fear
of
anger
of
all
such
states
of
mind
as
might
here
have
been
operative
it
requires
the
establishment
of
his
unbiased
vision
of
the
subject
from
a
period
antecedent
to
these
influences
opinions
valuations
prejudices
superstitions
may
here
be
to
a
high
degree
factors
of
disturbance
and
confusion
only
when
the
whole
augean
stable
is
swept
out
may
the
man
be
supposed
capable
of
apperception
may
the
thing
he
is
to
tell
us
be
brought
to
bear
upon
him
and
he
be
permitted
to
reproduce
it
this
necessary
preliminary
is
not
so
difficult
if
the
second
of
the
rules
is
observed
and
the
of
the
witness
is
studied
out
it
may
be
said
indeed
that
so
long
as
two
people
converse
unaware
of
each
thought
they
speak
different
languages
some
of
the
most
striking
misunderstandings
come
from
just
this
reason
it
is
not
alone
a
matter
of
varying
verbal
values
leading
to
incompatible
inferences
actually
the
whole
of
a
mind
is
involved
it
is
generally
supposed
to
be
enough
to
know
the
meaning
of
the
words
necessary
for
telling
a
story
but
such
knowledge
leads
only
to
external
and
very
superficial
comprehension
real
clearness
can
be
attained
only
by
knowing
the
habits
of
thought
in
regard
to
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
i
remember
vividly
a
case
of
jealous
murder
in
which
the
most
important
witness
was
the
brother
an
honest
simple
woodsman
brought
up
in
the
wilderness
and
in
every
sense
from
idiocy
his
testimony
was
brief
decided
and
intelligent
when
the
motive
for
the
murder
in
this
case
most
important
came
under
discussion
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
answered
my
question
whether
it
was
not
committed
on
account
of
a
girl
with
so
they
on
further
examination
i
reached
the
astonishing
discovery
that
not
only
the
word
but
the
very
notion
and
comprehension
of
it
were
totally
foreign
to
the
man
the
single
girl
he
at
one
time
thought
of
was
won
away
from
him
without
making
him
quarrelsome
nobody
had
ever
told
him
of
the
pangs
and
passions
of
other
people
he
had
had
no
occasion
to
consider
the
theoretic
possibility
of
such
a
thing
and
so
remained
utterly
foreign
to
him
it
is
clear
that
his
hearing
now
took
quite
another
turn
all
i
thought
i
heard
from
him
was
essentially
wrong
his
concerning
a
very
important
in
this
case
a
regulative
concept
had
been
too
poor
the
discovery
of
the
is
indubitably
not
easy
but
its
objective
possibility
with
witness
and
accused
is
at
least
a
fact
it
is
excluded
only
where
it
is
most
obviously
necessary
in
the
case
of
the
jury
and
the
impossibility
in
this
case
turns
the
institution
of
trial
by
jury
into
a
utopian
dream
the
presiding
officer
of
a
jury
court
is
in
the
best
instances
acquainted
with
a
few
of
the
jurymen
but
never
so
far
as
to
have
been
entrusted
with
their
now
and
then
when
a
juryman
asks
a
question
one
gets
a
glimpse
of
it
and
when
the
public
prosecutor
and
the
attorney
for
the
defence
make
their
speeches
one
catches
something
from
the
expressions
and
then
it
is
generally
too
late
even
if
it
be
discovered
earlier
nothing
can
be
done
with
it
some
success
is
likely
in
the
case
of
single
individuals
but
it
is
simply
impossible
to
define
the
mental
habits
of
twelve
men
with
whom
one
has
no
particular
relations
the
third
part
of
the
fr√∂belian
rule
presuppose
as
little
as
possible
must
be
rigidly
adhered
to
i
do
not
say
this
pessimistically
but
simply
because
we
lawyers
through
endless
practice
arrange
the
issue
so
much
more
easily
conceive
its
history
better
and
know
what
to
exclude
and
what
with
some
degree
of
certainty
to
retain
in
consequence
we
often
forget
our
powers
and
present
the
unskilled
laity
even
when
persons
of
education
too
much
of
the
material
then
it
must
be
considered
that
most
witnesses
are
uneducated
that
we
can
not
actually
descend
to
their
level
and
their
unhappiness
under
a
flood
of
strange
material
we
can
grasp
only
with
difficulty
because
we
do
not
know
the
point
of
view
we
ask
too
much
of
him
and
therefore
fail
in
our
purpose
and
if
in
some
exceptional
case
an
educated
man
is
on
the
stand
we
fail
again
since
having
the
habit
of
dealing
with
the
uneducated
we
suppose
this
man
to
know
our
own
specialties
because
he
has
a
little
education
experience
does
not
dispel
this
illusion
whether
actual
training
in
another
direction
dulls
the
natural
and
free
outlook
we
desire
in
the
witness
or
whether
in
our
profession
education
presupposes
tendencies
too
ideal
whatever
be
the
reasons
it
is
a
fact
that
our
hardest
work
is
generally
with
the
most
highly
educated
witnesses
i
once
had
to
write
a
protocol
based
on
the
testimony
of
a
famous
scholar
who
was
witness
in
a
small
affair
it
was
a
slow
job
either
he
did
not
like
the
terms
as
i
dictated
them
or
he
was
doubtful
of
the
complete
certainty
of
this
or
that
assertion
let
alone
that
i
wasted
an
hour
or
two
that
protocol
though
rewritten
was
full
of
corrections
and
erasures
and
the
thing
turned
out
to
be
nonsense
at
the
end
the
beginning
contradicted
the
conclusion
it
was
unintelligible
and
still
worse
untrue
as
became
manifest
later
through
the
indubitable
testimony
of
many
witnesses
the
scholar
had
been
so
conscientious
careful
and
accurate
that
he
simply
did
not
know
what
he
had
seen
his
testimony
was
worthless
i
have
had
such
experiences
repeatedly
and
others
have
confessed
them
to
the
question
where
not
presuppose
too
much
the
answer
is
everywhere
first
of
all
little
must
be
presupposed
concerning
powers
of
observation
they
claim
to
have
heard
seen
or
felt
so
and
so
and
they
have
not
seen
heard
or
felt
it
at
all
or
quite
differently
they
assent
vigorously
that
they
have
grasped
touched
counted
or
examined
something
and
on
closer
examination
it
is
demonstrated
that
it
was
only
a
passing
glance
they
threw
on
it
and
it
is
still
worse
where
something
more
than
ordinary
perception
is
being
considered
when
exceptionally
keen
senses
or
information
are
necessary
people
trust
the
conventional
and
when
close
observation
is
required
often
lack
the
knowledge
proper
to
their
particular
status
in
this
way
by
presupposing
especial
professional
knowledge
in
a
given
witness
great
mistakes
are
made
generally
he
such
knowledge
or
has
not
made
any
particular
use
of
it
in
the
same
way
too
much
attention
and
interest
are
often
presupposed
only
to
lead
later
to
the
astonishing
discovery
of
how
little
attention
men
really
pay
to
their
own
affairs
still
less
therefore
ought
knowledge
in
less
personal
things
be
presupposed
for
in
the
matter
of
real
understanding
the
ignorance
of
men
far
exceeds
all
presuppositions
most
people
know
the
looks
of
all
sorts
of
things
and
think
they
know
their
essences
and
when
questioned
invariably
assert
it
quite
in
good
faith
but
if
you
depend
on
such
knowledge
bad
results
arise
that
are
all
the
more
dangerous
because
there
is
rarely
later
opportunity
to
recognize
their
badness
as
often
as
any
new
matter
is
discussed
with
a
witness
it
is
necessary
before
all
to
find
out
his
general
knowledge
of
it
what
he
considers
it
to
be
and
what
ideas
he
connects
with
it
if
you
judge
that
he
knows
nothing
about
it
and
appraise
his
questions
and
conclusions
accordingly
you
will
at
least
not
go
wrong
in
the
matter
and
all
in
all
attain
your
end
most
swiftly
at
the
same
time
it
is
necessary
to
proceed
as
slowly
as
possible
it
is
carus
who
points
out
that
a
scholar
ought
not
to
be
shown
any
object
unless
he
can
not
discover
it
or
its
like
for
himself
each
power
must
have
developed
before
it
can
be
used
difficult
as
this
procedure
generally
is
it
is
necessary
in
the
teaching
of
children
and
is
there
successful
it
is
a
form
of
education
by
examples
the
child
is
taught
to
assimilate
to
its
past
experience
the
new
fact
in
a
comparison
of
some
keen
suffering
of
the
child
with
that
it
made
an
animal
suffer
such
parallels
rarely
fail
whether
in
the
education
of
children
or
of
witnesses
the
lengthy
description
of
an
event
in
which
somebody
is
manhandled
may
become
quite
different
if
the
witness
is
brought
to
recall
his
own
experience
at
first
he
speaks
of
the
event
as
perhaps
a
joke
but
as
soon
as
he
is
brought
to
speak
of
a
similar
situation
of
his
own
and
the
two
stories
are
set
side
by
side
his
description
alters
this
exemplification
may
be
varied
in
many
directions
and
is
always
useful
it
is
applicable
even
to
accused
inasmuch
as
the
performer
himself
begins
to
understand
his
deed
when
it
can
be
attached
to
his
fully
familiar
inner
life
the
greatest
skill
in
this
matter
may
be
exercised
in
the
case
of
the
jury
connect
the
present
new
facts
with
similar
ones
they
already
know
and
so
make
the
matter
intelligible
to
them
the
difficulty
here
is
again
the
fact
that
the
jury
is
composed
of
strangers
and
twelve
in
number
finding
instances
familiar
to
them
all
and
familiar
in
such
wise
that
they
may
easily
link
them
with
the
case
under
consideration
is
a
rare
event
if
it
does
happen
the
success
is
both
significant
and
happy
it
is
not
however
sufficient
to
seek
out
a
familiar
case
analogous
to
that
under
consideration
the
analogy
should
be
discovered
for
each
event
each
motive
each
opinion
each
reaction
each
appearance
if
people
are
to
understand
and
follow
the
case
ideas
like
men
have
an
ancestry
and
a
knowledge
of
the
ancestors
leads
to
a
discovery
of
the
cousins
section
e
egoism
it
is
possible
that
the
inner
character
of
egoism
shall
be
as
profoundly
potent
in
legal
matters
as
in
the
daily
life
goethe
has
experienced
its
effect
with
unparalleled
keenness
me
tell
you
something
he
writes
conversations
with
eckermann
vol
periods
considered
regressive
or
transitional
are
subjective
conversely
all
progressive
periods
look
outward
the
whole
of
contemporary
civilization
is
reactionary
because
subjective
the
thing
of
importance
is
everywhere
the
individual
who
is
trying
to
show
off
his
lordliness
nowhere
is
any
mentionable
effort
to
be
found
that
subordinates
itself
through
love
of
the
these
unmistakable
terms
contain
a
that
is
applicable
to
our
days
even
better
than
to
is
characteristic
of
our
time
that
each
man
has
an
exaggerated
interest
in
consequently
he
is
concerned
only
with
himself
or
with
his
immediate
environment
he
understands
only
what
he
already
knows
and
feels
and
he
works
only
where
he
can
attain
some
personal
advantage
it
is
hence
to
be
concluded
that
we
may
proceed
with
certainty
only
when
we
count
on
this
exaggerated
egoism
and
use
it
as
a
prime
factor
the
most
insignificant
little
things
attest
this
a
man
who
gets
a
printed
directory
will
look
his
own
name
up
though
he
knows
it
is
there
and
contemplate
it
with
pleasure
he
does
the
same
with
the
photograph
of
a
group
of
which
his
worthy
self
is
one
of
the
immortalized
if
personal
qualities
are
under
discussion
he
is
happy
when
he
can
say
i
am
by
nature
if
foreign
cities
are
under
discussion
he
tells
stories
of
his
native
city
or
of
cities
that
he
has
visited
and
concerning
things
that
can
interest
only
him
who
has
been
there
everyone
makes
an
effort
to
bring
something
of
his
personal
status
to
bear
either
the
conditions
of
his
life
or
matters
concerning
only
him
if
anybody
announces
that
he
has
had
a
good
time
he
means
without
exception
absolutely
without
exception
that
he
has
had
an
opportunity
to
push
his
very
forcefully
into
the
foreground
lazarus
has
rightly
given
this
human
quality
historical
significance
owed
a
considerable
part
of
his
political
dictatorate
to
the
circumstance
of
knowing
practically
all
athenian
citizens
by
name
hannibal
wallenstein
napoleon
i
infected
their
armies
thanks
to
ambition
with
more
courage
than
could
the
deepest
love
of
arms
country
and
freedom
just
through
knowing
and
calling
by
name
the
individual
daily
we
get
small
examples
of
this
egoism
the
most
disgusting
and
boresome
witness
who
is
perhaps
angry
at
having
been
dragged
so
far
from
his
work
can
be
rendered
valuable
and
useful
through
the
initial
show
of
a
little
interest
of
some
comprehension
of
his
affairs
and
of
some
consideration
wherever
possible
of
his
views
and
efficiency
moreover
men
judge
their
fellows
according
to
their
comprehension
of
their
own
particular
professions
the
story
of
the
sneer
at
a
physician
what
can
he
know
when
he
does
not
even
know
how
to
sow
oats
is
more
than
a
story
and
is
true
of
others
besides
illiterate
boors
such
an
attitude
recurs
very
frequently
particularly
among
people
of
engrossing
trades
that
require
much
time
among
soldiers
horsemen
sailors
hunters
etc
if
it
is
not
possible
to
understand
these
human
vanities
and
to
deal
with
these
people
as
one
of
the
trade
it
is
wise
at
least
to
suggest
such
understanding
to
show
interest
in
their
affairs
and
to
let
them
believe
that
really
you
think
it
needful
for
everybody
to
know
how
to
saddle
a
horse
correctly
or
to
distinguish
the
german
from
the
english
setter
at
a
thousand
paces
what
is
aimed
at
is
not
personal
respect
for
the
judge
but
for
the
function
which
the
witness
identifies
with
the
person
if
he
has
such
respect
he
will
find
it
worth
the
trouble
to
help
us
out
to
think
carefully
and
to
assist
in
the
difficult
conclusion
of
the
case
there
is
an
astonishing
difference
between
the
contribution
of
a
sulking
and
contrary
witness
and
of
one
who
has
become
interested
and
pleased
by
the
affair
not
only
quantity
but
truth
and
reliability
of
testimony
are
immensely
greater
in
the
latter
case
besides
the
antecedent
goes
so
far
that
it
may
become
very
important
in
the
examination
of
the
accused
not
that
a
trap
is
to
be
set
for
him
merely
that
since
it
is
our
business
to
get
at
the
truth
we
ought
to
proceed
in
such
proper
wise
with
a
denying
accused
as
might
bring
to
light
facts
that
otherwise
careful
manipulation
would
not
have
brought
out
how
often
have
anonymous
or
pseudonymous
criminals
betrayed
themselves
under
examination
just
because
they
spoke
of
circumstances
involving
their
capital
and
spoke
so
clearly
that
now
the
clue
was
found
it
was
no
longer
difficult
to
follow
it
up
in
the
examination
of
criminals
dozens
of
such
instances
occur
the
fact
is
not
new
but
it
needs
to
be
made
use
of
a
similar
motive
belongs
to
subordinate
forms
of
egoism
the
obstinacy
of
a
man
who
may
be
so
vexed
by
contradiction
as
to
drive
one
into
despair
and
who
under
proper
treatment
becomes
valuable
this
i
learned
mainly
from
my
old
butler
a
magnificent
honest
soldier
a
figure
out
of
a
comedy
but
endowed
with
inexorable
obstinacy
against
which
my
skill
for
a
long
time
availed
nothing
as
often
as
i
proposed
something
with
regard
to
some
intended
piece
of
work
or
alteration
i
got
the
identical
reply
do
finally
i
got
hold
of
a
list
and
worked
my
plan
this
will
now
be
done
as
simon
recently
said
it
should
be
done
at
this
he
looked
at
me
tried
to
think
when
he
had
said
this
thing
and
went
and
did
it
and
in
spite
of
frequent
application
this
list
has
not
failed
once
for
some
years
what
is
best
about
it
is
that
it
will
serve
mutatis
mutandis
with
criminals
as
soon
as
ever
real
balkiness
is
noted
it
becomes
necessary
to
avoid
the
least
appearance
of
contradictoriness
since
that
increases
difficulties
it
is
not
necessary
to
lie
or
to
make
use
of
trickery
only
avoid
direct
contradiction
drop
the
subject
in
question
and
return
to
it
indirectly
when
you
perceive
that
the
obstinate
individual
recognizes
his
error
then
you
may
succeed
in
building
him
a
golden
bridge
or
at
least
a
barely
visible
sidedoor
where
he
can
make
his
retreat
unnoticed
in
that
case
even
the
most
difficult
of
obstinates
will
no
longer
repeat
the
old
story
he
will
repeat
only
if
he
is
pressed
and
this
although
he
is
repeatedly
brought
back
to
the
point
if
however
the
matter
is
once
decided
beware
of
returning
to
it
without
any
other
reason
save
to
confirm
the
settled
matter
quite
completely
that
would
be
only
to
wake
the
sleeper
to
give
him
a
sleeping
powder
speaking
generally
the
significant
rule
is
this
laziness
and
conceit
are
the
only
human
motives
on
which
one
may
unconditionally
love
loyalty
honesty
religion
and
patriotism
though
firm
as
a
rock
may
lapse
and
fall
a
man
might
have
been
counted
on
for
one
of
these
qualities
ten
times
with
safety
and
on
the
eleventh
he
might
collapse
like
a
house
of
cards
count
on
egoism
and
laziness
a
hundred
or
a
thousand
times
and
they
are
as
firm
as
ever
more
simply
count
on
egoism
for
laziness
and
conceit
are
only
modifications
of
egoism
the
latter
alone
then
should
be
the
one
human
motive
to
keep
in
mind
when
dealing
with
men
there
are
cases
enough
when
all
the
wheels
are
set
in
motion
after
a
clue
to
the
truth
when
there
is
danger
that
the
person
under
suspicion
is
innocent
appeals
to
honor
conscience
humanity
and
religion
fail
but
run
the
complete
gamut
of
and
the
whole
truth
rings
clear
egoism
is
the
best
criterion
of
the
presence
of
veracity
suppose
a
coherent
explanation
has
been
painfully
constructed
it
is
obvious
that
the
correctness
of
the
construction
is
studied
with
reference
to
the
given
motive
now
if
the
links
in
the
chain
reach
easily
back
to
the
motive
there
is
at
least
the
possibility
that
the
chain
is
free
of
error
what
then
of
the
motive
if
it
is
noble
friendship
love
humaneness
loyalty
mercy
the
constructed
chain
may
be
correct
and
happily
is
so
oftener
than
is
thought
but
it
be
correct
if
however
the
structure
rests
on
egoism
in
any
of
its
innumerable
forms
and
if
it
is
logically
sound
then
the
whole
case
is
explained
utterly
and
reliably
the
construction
is
indubitably
correct
section
f
secrets
the
determination
of
the
truth
at
law
would
succeed
much
less
frequently
than
it
does
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
men
find
it
very
difficult
to
keep
secrets
this
essentially
notable
and
not
clearly
understood
circumstance
is
popularly
familiar
proverbs
of
all
people
deal
with
it
and
point
mainly
to
the
fact
that
keeping
secrets
is
especially
difficult
for
women
the
italians
say
a
woman
who
may
not
speak
is
in
danger
of
bursting
the
germans
that
the
burden
of
secrecy
affects
her
health
and
ages
her
prematurely
the
english
say
similar
things
still
more
coarsely
classical
proverbs
have
dealt
with
the
issue
numberless
fairy
tales
narratives
novels
and
poems
have
portrayed
the
difficulty
of
silence
and
one
very
fine
modern
novel
die
last
des
schweigens
by
ferdinand
k√ºrnberger
has
chosen
this
fact
for
its
principal
motive
the
universal
difficulty
of
keeping
silence
is
expressed
by
lotze
in
the
dictum
that
we
learn
expression
very
young
and
silence
very
late
the
fact
is
of
use
to
the
criminalist
not
only
in
regard
to
criminals
but
also
with
regard
to
witnesses
who
for
one
reason
or
another
want
to
keep
something
back
the
latter
is
the
source
of
a
good
deal
of
danger
inasmuch
as
the
witness
is
compelled
to
speak
and
circles
around
the
secret
in
question
without
touching
it
until
he
points
it
out
and
half
reveals
it
if
he
stops
there
the
matter
requires
consideration
for
half
truth
is
worse
than
a
whole
the
latter
reveals
its
subject
and
intent
and
permits
of
defence
while
the
half
truth
may
by
association
and
circumscriptive
limitations
cause
vexatious
errors
both
as
regards
the
identity
of
the
and
as
regards
the
circumstances
with
which
he
is
thus
involved
for
this
reason
the
criminalist
must
consider
the
question
of
secrets
carefully
as
for
his
own
silence
this
must
be
considered
in
both
directions
that
he
is
not
to
blab
official
secrets
is
so
obvious
that
it
need
not
be
spoken
of
such
blabbing
is
so
negligent
and
dishonorable
that
we
must
consider
it
intrinsically
impossible
but
it
not
infrequently
happens
that
some
indications
are
dropped
or
persuaded
out
of
a
criminal
judge
generally
out
of
one
of
the
younger
and
more
eager
men
they
mention
only
the
event
itself
and
not
a
name
nor
a
place
nor
a
particular
time
nor
some
even
more
intimate
matter
there
seems
no
harm
done
and
yet
the
most
important
points
have
often
been
blabbed
of
in
just
such
a
way
and
what
is
worst
of
all
just
because
the
speaker
has
not
known
the
name
nor
anything
else
concrete
the
issue
may
be
diverted
and
enmesh
some
guiltless
person
it
is
worth
considering
that
the
effort
above
mentioned
is
made
only
in
the
most
interesting
cases
that
crimes
especially
move
people
to
disgusting
interest
due
to
the
fact
that
there
is
a
more
varied
approach
to
synthesis
of
a
case
when
the
same
story
is
repeated
several
times
or
by
various
witnesses
for
by
such
means
extrapolations
and
combinations
of
the
material
are
made
possible
by
way
of
warning
let
me
remind
you
of
an
ancient
and
much
quoted
anecdote
first
brought
to
light
by
boccaccio
a
young
and
much
loved
abb√©
was
teased
by
a
bevy
of
ladies
to
narrate
what
had
happened
in
the
first
confession
he
had
experienced
after
long
hesitation
the
young
fellow
decided
that
it
was
no
sin
to
relate
the
confessed
sin
if
he
suppressed
the
name
of
the
confessor
and
so
he
told
the
ladies
that
his
first
confession
was
of
infidelity
a
few
minutes
later
a
couple
of
tardy
guests
appeared
a
marquis
and
his
charming
wife
both
reproached
the
young
priest
for
his
infrequent
visits
at
their
home
the
marquise
exclaimed
so
that
everybody
heard
is
not
nice
of
you
to
neglect
me
your
first
this
squib
is
very
significant
for
our
profession
for
it
is
well
known
how
in
the
same
way
facts
as
safe
are
carried
further
the
listener
does
not
have
to
combine
them
the
facts
combine
themselves
by
means
of
others
otherwise
acquired
and
finally
the
most
important
official
matters
on
the
concealment
of
which
much
may
perhaps
have
depended
become
universally
known
official
secrets
have
a
general
significance
and
must
therefore
be
guarded
at
all
points
and
not
merely
in
detail
the
second
direction
in
which
the
criminal
justice
must
maintain
silence
looks
toward
witnesses
and
accused
if
in
the
first
instance
the
cause
of
too
much
communicativeness
was
an
to
talk
its
cause
in
this
case
is
a
certain
conceit
that
teases
one
into
talking
whether
the
justice
wants
to
show
the
accused
how
much
he
already
knows
or
how
correctly
he
has
drawn
his
conclusions
whether
he
wishes
to
impress
the
witness
by
his
confidences
he
may
do
equally
as
much
harm
in
one
case
as
in
the
other
any
success
is
made
especially
impossible
if
the
judge
has
been
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
and
tried
to
show
himself
fully
informed
at
the
very
beginning
but
has
brought
out
instead
some
error
the
accused
naturally
leaves
him
with
his
false
suppositions
they
suggest
things
to
the
witness
and
what
follows
may
be
easily
considered
correct
procedure
in
such
circumstances
is
difficult
never
to
reveal
what
is
already
known
is
to
deprive
oneself
of
one
of
the
most
important
means
of
examination
use
of
it
therefore
ought
not
to
be
belated
but
it
is
much
worse
to
be
premature
or
garrulous
in
my
own
experience
i
have
never
been
sorry
for
keeping
silence
especially
if
i
had
already
said
something
the
only
rule
in
the
matter
is
comparatively
never
move
toward
any
incorrectness
and
never
present
the
appearance
of
knowing
more
than
you
actually
do
setting
aside
the
dishonesty
of
such
a
procedure
the
danger
of
a
painful
exposure
in
such
matters
is
great
there
is
still
another
great
danger
which
one
may
beware
of
optima
fide
the
danger
of
knowing
something
untrue
this
danger
also
is
greatest
for
the
greatest
talent
and
the
greatest
courage
among
us
because
they
are
the
readiest
hands
at
synthesis
inference
and
definition
of
possibilities
and
see
as
indubitable
and
shut
to
contradiction
things
that
at
best
are
mere
possibilities
it
is
indifferent
to
the
outcome
whether
a
lie
has
been
told
purposely
or
whether
it
has
been
the
mere
honest
explosion
of
an
temperament
it
is
therefore
unnecessary
to
point
out
the
occasion
for
caution
one
need
only
suggest
that
something
may
be
learned
from
people
who
talk
too
much
the
of
a
neighbor
is
quickly
noticeable
and
if
the
why
and
how
much
of
it
are
carefully
studied
out
it
is
not
difficult
to
draw
a
significant
analogy
for
own
case
in
the
matter
of
secrets
of
other
people
obviously
the
thing
to
be
established
first
is
what
is
actually
a
secret
what
is
to
be
suppressed
if
one
is
to
avoid
damage
to
self
or
another
when
an
actual
secret
is
recognized
it
is
necessary
to
consider
whether
the
damage
is
greater
through
keeping
or
through
revealing
the
secret
if
it
is
still
possible
it
is
well
to
let
the
secret
be
there
is
always
damage
and
generally
not
insignificant
damage
when
it
is
tortured
out
of
a
witness
if
however
one
is
honestly
convinced
that
the
secret
must
be
revealed
as
when
a
guiltless
person
is
endangered
every
effort
and
all
skill
is
to
be
applied
in
the
revelation
inasmuch
as
the
least
echo
of
bad
faith
is
here
impossible
the
job
is
never
easy
the
chief
rule
is
not
to
be
overeager
in
getting
at
the
desired
secret
the
more
important
it
is
the
less
ought
to
be
made
of
it
it
is
best
not
directly
to
lead
for
it
it
will
appear
of
itself
especially
if
it
is
important
many
a
fact
which
the
possessor
had
set
no
great
store
by
has
been
turned
into
a
carefully
guarded
secret
by
means
of
the
eagerness
with
which
it
was
sought
in
cases
of
need
when
every
other
means
has
failed
it
may
not
be
too
much
to
tell
the
witness
cautiously
of
course
rather
more
of
the
crime
than
might
otherwise
have
seemed
good
then
those
episodes
must
be
carefully
hit
on
which
cluster
about
the
desired
secret
and
from
which
its
importance
arises
if
the
witness
understands
that
he
presents
something
really
important
by
giving
up
his
secret
surprising
consequences
ensue
the
relatively
most
important
secret
is
that
of
own
guilt
and
the
associated
most
suggestive
establishment
of
it
the
confession
is
a
very
extraordinary
psychological
problem
in
many
cases
the
reasons
for
confession
are
very
obvious
the
criminal
sees
that
the
evidence
is
so
complete
that
he
is
soon
to
be
convicted
and
seeks
a
mitigation
of
the
sentence
by
confession
or
he
hopes
through
a
more
honest
narration
of
the
crime
to
throw
a
great
degree
of
the
guilt
on
another
in
addition
there
is
a
thread
of
vanity
in
confession
as
among
young
peasants
who
confess
to
a
greater
share
in
a
burglary
than
they
actually
had
easily
discoverable
by
the
magniloquent
manner
of
describing
their
actual
crime
then
there
are
confessions
made
for
the
sake
of
care
and
winter
lodgings
the
confession
arising
from
as
among
political
criminals
and
others
there
are
even
confessions
arising
from
nobility
from
the
wish
to
save
an
intimate
and
confessions
intended
to
deceive
and
such
as
occur
especially
in
conspiracy
and
are
made
to
gain
time
either
for
the
flight
of
the
real
criminal
or
for
the
destruction
of
compromising
objects
generally
in
the
latter
case
guilt
is
admitted
only
until
the
plan
for
which
it
was
made
has
succeeded
then
the
judge
is
surprised
with
regular
and
successful
establishment
of
an
alibi
not
infrequently
confession
of
small
crimes
is
made
to
establish
an
alibi
for
a
greater
one
and
finally
there
are
the
confessions
catholics
are
required
to
make
in
confessional
and
the
death
bed
confessions
the
first
are
distinguished
by
the
fact
that
they
are
made
freely
and
that
the
confessee
does
not
try
to
mitigate
his
crime
but
is
aiming
to
make
amends
even
when
he
finds
it
hard
and
desires
even
a
definite
penance
death
bed
confessions
may
indeed
have
religious
grounds
or
the
desire
to
prevent
the
punishment
or
the
further
punishment
of
an
innocent
person
although
this
list
of
explicable
is
long
it
is
in
no
way
exhaustive
it
is
only
a
small
portion
of
all
the
confessions
that
we
receive
of
these
the
greater
part
remain
more
or
less
unexplained
mittermaier
has
already
dealt
with
these
acutely
and
cites
examples
as
well
as
the
relatively
older
literature
of
the
subject
a
number
of
cases
may
perhaps
be
explained
through
pressure
of
conscience
especially
where
there
are
involved
hysterical
or
nervous
persons
who
are
plagued
with
vengeful
images
in
which
the
ghost
of
their
victim
would
appear
or
in
whose
ear
the
unendurable
clang
of
the
stolen
money
never
ceases
etc
if
the
confessor
only
intends
to
free
himself
from
these
disturbing
images
and
the
consequent
punishment
by
means
of
confession
we
are
not
dealing
with
what
is
properly
called
conscience
but
more
or
less
with
disease
with
an
abnormally
excited
imagination
but
where
such
hallucinations
are
lacking
and
religious
influences
are
absent
and
the
confession
is
made
freely
in
response
to
mere
pressure
we
have
a
case
of
conscience
another
of
those
terms
which
need
explanation
i
know
of
no
analogy
in
the
inner
nature
of
man
in
which
anybody
with
open
eyes
does
himself
exclusive
harm
without
any
contingent
use
being
apparent
as
is
the
case
in
this
class
of
confession
there
is
always
considerable
difficulty
in
explaining
these
cases
one
way
of
explaining
them
is
to
say
that
their
source
is
mere
stupidity
and
impulsiveness
or
simply
to
deny
their
occurrence
but
the
theory
of
stupidity
does
not
appeal
to
the
practitioner
for
even
if
we
agree
that
a
man
foolishly
makes
a
confession
and
later
when
he
perceives
his
mistake
bitterly
regrets
telling
it
we
still
find
many
confessions
that
are
not
regretted
and
the
makers
of
which
can
in
no
wise
be
accused
of
defective
intelligence
to
deny
that
there
are
such
is
comfortable
but
wrong
because
we
each
know
collections
of
cases
in
which
no
effort
could
bring
to
light
a
motive
for
the
confession
the
confession
was
made
because
the
confessor
wanted
to
make
it
and
the
whole
story
the
making
of
a
confession
according
to
laymen
ends
the
matter
but
really
the
work
begins
with
it
as
a
matter
of
caution
all
statutes
approve
confessions
as
evidence
only
when
they
agree
completely
with
the
other
evidence
confession
is
a
means
of
proof
and
not
proof
some
objective
evidentially
concurrent
support
and
confirmation
of
the
confession
is
required
but
the
same
legal
requirement
necessitates
that
the
value
of
the
concurrent
evidence
shall
depend
on
its
having
been
arrived
at
and
established
independently
the
existence
of
a
confession
contains
powerful
suggestive
influences
for
judge
witness
expert
for
all
concerned
in
the
case
if
a
confession
is
made
all
that
is
perceived
in
the
case
may
be
seen
in
the
light
of
it
and
experience
teaches
well
enough
how
that
alters
the
situation
there
is
so
strong
an
inclination
to
and
adapt
everything
perceived
in
some
given
explanation
that
the
explanation
is
strained
after
and
facts
are
squeezed
and
trimmed
until
they
fit
easily
it
is
a
remarkable
phenomenon
confirmable
by
all
observers
that
all
our
perceptions
are
at
first
soft
and
plastic
and
easily
take
form
according
to
the
shape
of
their
predecessors
they
become
stiff
and
inflexible
only
when
we
have
had
them
for
some
time
and
have
permitted
them
to
reach
an
equilibrium
if
then
observations
are
made
in
accord
with
certain
notions
the
plastic
material
is
easily
molded
excrescences
and
unevenness
are
squeezed
away
lacun√¶
are
filled
up
and
if
it
is
at
all
possible
the
adaptation
is
completed
easily
then
if
a
new
and
quite
different
notion
arises
in
us
the
alteration
of
the
observed
material
occurs
as
easily
again
and
only
long
afterwards
when
the
observation
has
hardened
do
fresh
alterations
fail
this
is
a
matter
of
daily
experience
in
our
professional
as
well
as
in
our
ordinary
affairs
we
hear
of
a
certain
crime
and
consider
the
earliest
data
for
one
reason
or
another
we
begin
to
suspect
a
as
the
criminal
the
result
of
an
examination
of
the
premises
is
applied
in
each
detail
to
this
proposition
it
fits
so
does
the
autopsy
so
do
the
depositions
of
the
witnesses
everything
fits
there
have
indeed
been
difficulties
but
they
have
been
set
aside
they
are
attributed
to
inaccurate
observation
and
the
like
the
point
is
that
the
evidence
is
against
a
now
suppose
that
soon
after
b
confesses
the
crime
this
event
is
so
significant
that
it
sets
aside
at
once
all
the
earlier
reasons
for
suspecting
a
and
the
theory
of
the
crime
involves
b
naturally
the
whole
material
must
now
be
applied
to
b
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
at
first
fitted
a
it
does
now
fit
b
here
again
difficulties
arise
but
they
are
to
be
set
aside
just
as
before
now
if
this
is
possible
with
evidence
written
and
thereby
unalterable
how
much
more
easily
can
it
be
done
with
testimony
about
to
be
taken
which
may
readily
be
colored
by
the
already
presented
confession
the
educational
conditions
involve
now
the
judge
and
his
assistants
on
the
one
hand
and
the
witnesses
on
the
other
concerning
himself
the
judge
must
continually
remember
that
his
business
is
not
to
fit
all
testimony
to
the
already
furnished
confession
allowing
the
evidence
to
serve
as
mere
decoration
to
the
latter
but
that
it
is
his
business
to
establish
his
proof
by
means
of
the
confession
and
by
means
of
the
other
evidence
the
legislators
of
contemporary
civilization
have
started
with
the
proper
presupposition
that
also
false
confessions
are
made
and
who
of
us
has
not
heard
such
confessions
for
whatever
reason
because
the
confessor
wants
to
die
because
he
is
diseased
because
he
wants
to
free
the
real
criminal
can
be
discovered
as
false
only
by
showing
their
contradiction
with
the
other
evidence
if
however
the
judge
only
fits
the
evidence
he
abandons
this
means
of
getting
the
truth
nor
must
false
confessions
be
supposed
to
occur
only
in
case
of
homicide
they
occur
most
numerously
in
cases
of
importance
where
more
than
one
person
is
involved
it
happens
perhaps
that
only
one
or
two
are
captured
and
they
assume
all
the
guilt
in
cases
of
larceny
brawls
rioting
etc
i
repeat
the
suggestive
power
of
a
confession
is
great
and
it
is
hence
really
not
easy
to
exclude
its
influence
and
to
consider
the
balance
of
the
evidence
on
its
merits
but
this
must
be
done
if
one
is
not
to
deceive
oneself
dealing
with
the
witness
is
still
more
ticklish
inasmuch
as
to
the
difficulties
with
them
is
added
the
difficulties
with
oneself
the
simplest
thing
would
be
to
deny
the
existence
of
a
confession
and
thus
to
get
the
witness
to
speak
without
prejudice
but
aside
from
the
fact
of
its
impossibility
as
a
lie
each
examination
of
a
witness
would
have
to
be
a
comedy
and
that
would
in
many
cases
be
impossible
as
the
witness
might
already
know
that
the
accused
had
confessed
the
only
thing
to
be
done
especially
when
it
is
permissible
for
other
reasons
is
to
tell
the
witness
that
a
confession
exists
and
to
call
to
his
attention
that
it
is
not
yet
evidence
and
finally
and
above
all
to
keep
head
and
to
prevent
the
witness
from
presenting
his
evidence
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
in
this
regard
it
can
not
be
sufficiently
demonstrated
that
the
coloring
of
a
true
bill
comes
much
less
from
the
witness
than
from
the
judge
the
most
excited
witness
can
be
brought
by
the
judge
to
a
sober
and
useful
point
of
view
and
conversely
the
most
calm
witness
may
utter
the
most
misleading
testimony
if
the
judge
abandons
in
any
way
the
safe
bottom
of
the
indubitably
established
fact
very
intelligent
witnesses
they
are
not
confined
to
the
educated
classes
may
be
dealt
with
constructively
and
be
told
after
their
depositions
that
the
case
is
to
be
considered
as
if
there
were
no
confession
whatever
there
is
an
astonishing
number
of
people
especially
among
the
peasants
who
are
amenable
to
such
considerations
and
willingly
follow
if
they
are
led
on
with
confidence
in
such
a
case
it
is
necessary
to
analyze
the
testimony
into
its
elements
this
analysis
is
most
difficult
and
important
since
it
must
be
determined
what
taken
in
itself
is
an
element
materially
not
formally
and
what
merely
appears
to
be
a
unit
suppose
that
during
a
great
brawl
a
man
was
stabbed
and
that
a
confesses
to
the
stabbing
now
a
witness
testified
that
a
had
first
uttered
a
threat
then
had
jumped
into
the
brawl
felt
in
his
bag
and
left
the
crowd
and
that
in
the
interval
between
entering
and
leaving
the
stabbing
occurred
in
this
simple
case
the
various
incidents
must
be
evaluated
and
each
must
be
considered
by
itself
so
we
consider
suppose
a
had
not
confessed
what
would
the
threat
have
counted
for
might
it
not
have
been
meant
for
the
assailants
of
the
injured
man
may
his
feeling
in
the
bag
not
be
interpreted
in
another
fashion
must
he
have
felt
for
a
knife
only
was
there
time
enough
to
open
it
and
to
stab
might
the
man
not
have
been
already
wounded
by
that
time
we
might
then
conclude
that
all
the
evidence
about
a
contained
nothing
against
him
but
if
we
relate
it
to
the
confession
then
this
evidence
is
almost
equal
to
direct
evidence
of
crime
but
if
individual
are
mingled
with
conclusions
and
if
other
equivalent
perceptions
have
to
be
considered
which
occurred
perhaps
to
other
people
then
the
analysis
is
hardly
so
simple
yet
it
must
be
made
in
dealing
with
less
intelligent
people
with
whom
this
construction
can
not
be
performed
one
must
be
satisfied
with
general
rules
by
demanding
complete
accuracy
and
insisting
in
any
event
on
the
ratio
sciendi
one
may
generally
succeed
in
turning
a
perception
uncertain
with
regard
to
any
individual
into
a
trustworthy
one
with
regard
to
the
confessor
it
happens
comparatively
seldom
that
untrue
confessions
are
discovered
but
once
this
does
occur
and
the
trouble
is
taken
to
subject
the
given
evidence
to
a
critical
comparison
the
manner
of
adaptation
of
the
evidence
to
the
confession
may
easily
be
discovered
the
witnesses
were
altogether
unwilling
to
tell
any
falsehood
and
the
judge
was
equally
eager
to
establish
the
truth
nevertheless
the
issue
must
have
received
considerable
perversion
in
order
to
fix
the
guilt
on
the
confessor
such
examinations
are
so
instructive
that
the
opportunity
to
make
them
should
never
be
missed
all
the
testimony
presents
a
typical
picture
the
evidence
is
consistent
with
the
theory
that
the
real
confessor
was
guilty
but
it
is
also
consistent
with
the
theory
that
the
real
criminal
was
guilty
but
some
details
must
be
altered
often
very
many
if
there
is
an
opportunity
to
hear
the
same
witnesses
again
the
procedure
becomes
still
more
instructive
the
witnesses
supposing
they
want
honestly
to
tell
the
truth
naturally
confirm
the
evidence
as
it
points
to
the
second
more
real
criminal
and
if
an
explanation
is
asked
for
the
statements
that
pointed
to
the
the
answers
make
it
indubitably
evident
that
their
incorrectness
came
as
without
intention
the
circumstance
that
a
confession
had
been
made
acted
as
a
suggestion
conditions
similar
to
confessional
circumstances
arise
when
other
types
of
persuasive
evidence
are
gathered
which
have
the
same
impressive
influence
as
confessions
in
such
cases
the
task
is
easier
than
the
since
he
need
not
tell
them
of
evidence
already
at
hand
how
very
much
people
allow
themselves
to
be
influenced
by
antecedent
grounds
of
suspicion
is
a
matter
of
daily
observation
one
example
will
suffice
an
intelligent
man
was
attacked
at
night
and
wounded
on
the
basis
of
his
description
an
individual
was
arrested
on
the
next
day
the
suspect
was
brought
before
the
man
for
identification
he
identified
the
man
with
certainty
but
inasmuch
as
his
description
did
not
quite
hit
off
the
suspect
he
was
asked
the
reason
for
his
certainty
you
certainly
would
not
have
brought
him
here
if
he
were
not
the
right
man
was
the
astonishing
reply
simply
because
the
suspect
was
arrested
on
the
story
of
the
wounded
man
and
brought
before
him
in
prison
garb
the
latter
thought
he
saw
such
corroboration
for
his
data
as
to
make
the
identification
certain
a
pure
·ΩëœÉœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ
œÄœÅœâœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ
which
did
not
at
all
occur
to
him
in
connection
with
the
vivid
impression
of
what
he
saw
i
believe
that
to
keep
going
with
merely
what
the
criminalist
knows
about
the
matter
belongs
to
his
most
difficult
tasks
section
g
interest
anybody
who
means
to
work
honestly
must
strive
to
awaken
and
to
sustain
the
interest
of
his
collaborators
a
duty
is
to
present
his
associates
material
systematic
and
exhaustive
but
not
redundant
and
to
be
himself
well
and
minutely
informed
concerning
the
case
whoever
so
proceeds
may
be
certain
in
even
the
most
ordinary
and
simplest
cases
of
the
interest
of
his
colleagues
hence
of
their
attention
and
in
consequence
of
the
best
in
their
power
these
are
essentially
propositions
in
certain
situations
however
more
is
asked
with
regard
to
the
experts
the
expert
whether
a
very
modest
workman
or
very
renowned
scholar
must
in
the
first
instance
become
convinced
of
the
complete
interest
in
his
work
of
the
power
to
value
the
effort
and
knowledge
it
requires
of
the
fact
that
he
does
not
question
and
listen
merely
because
the
law
requires
it
and
finally
of
the
fact
that
the
judge
is
endowed
so
far
as
may
be
with
a
definite
comprehension
of
the
task
however
conscientiously
and
intensely
the
expert
may
apply
himself
to
his
problem
it
will
be
impossible
to
work
at
it
with
real
interest
if
he
finds
no
no
interest
and
no
understanding
among
those
for
whom
he
at
least
formally
is
at
work
we
may
be
certain
that
the
paucity
of
respect
we
get
from
the
scientific
representatives
of
other
disciplines
let
us
be
honest
such
is
the
case
comes
particularly
from
those
relations
we
have
with
them
as
experts
relations
in
which
they
find
us
so
unintelligent
and
so
indifferent
with
regard
to
matters
of
importance
if
the
experts
speak
of
us
with
small
respect
and
the
attitude
spreads
and
becomes
general
we
get
only
our
full
due
nobody
can
require
of
a
criminal
judge
profound
knowledge
of
all
other
disciplines
besides
his
own
the
experts
supply
that
but
the
judge
certainly
must
have
some
insight
into
them
in
so
far
as
they
affect
his
own
work
if
he
is
not
to
meet
the
expert
unintelligent
and
unintelligible
and
if
he
is
to
with
and
succeed
in
appraising
the
work
in
a
like
fashion
the
judge
may
be
required
to
take
interest
in
the
result
if
the
judge
receives
their
report
and
sticks
to
the
statutes
if
he
never
shows
that
he
was
anxious
about
their
verdict
and
merely
views
it
as
a
number
it
is
no
wonder
that
in
the
end
the
expert
also
regards
his
work
as
a
mere
number
and
loses
interest
no
man
is
interested
in
a
thing
unless
it
is
made
interesting
and
the
expert
is
no
exception
naturally
no
one
would
say
that
the
judge
should
pretend
interest
that
would
be
worst
of
all
he
must
be
possessed
of
it
or
he
will
not
do
for
a
judge
but
interest
may
be
intensified
and
vitalized
if
the
judge
perceives
that
the
finding
of
the
experts
is
very
important
for
his
case
he
must
at
least
meet
them
with
interest
in
it
if
that
is
present
he
will
read
their
reports
attentively
will
note
that
he
does
not
understand
some
things
and
ask
the
experts
for
elucidation
one
question
gives
rise
to
another
one
answer
after
another
causes
understanding
and
understanding
implies
an
interest
it
never
happens
that
there
should
be
difficulties
because
of
a
request
to
judicial
experts
to
explain
things
to
the
judge
i
have
never
met
any
in
my
own
practice
and
have
never
heard
any
complaints
on
the
contrary
pleasure
and
efficiency
are
generally
noticeable
in
such
connections
and
the
state
above
all
is
the
gainer
the
simple
explanation
lies
here
in
the
fact
that
the
expert
is
interested
in
his
profession
interested
in
just
that
concrete
way
in
which
the
incomparably
greater
number
of
jurists
are
not
and
this
again
is
based
upon
a
sad
fact
for
us
the
chemist
the
physician
studies
his
subject
because
he
wants
to
become
a
chemist
physician
but
the
lawyer
studies
law
not
because
he
wants
to
become
a
lawyer
but
because
he
wants
to
become
an
official
and
as
he
has
no
especial
interest
he
chooses
his
state
position
in
that
branch
in
which
he
thinks
he
has
the
best
prospects
it
is
a
bitter
truth
and
a
general
rule
that
those
who
want
to
study
law
and
the
science
of
law
are
the
exceptions
and
that
hence
we
have
to
acquire
a
real
interest
in
our
subject
from
laymen
from
our
experts
but
the
interest
can
be
acquired
and
with
the
growth
of
interest
there
is
growth
of
knowledge
and
therewith
increase
of
pleasure
in
the
work
itself
and
hence
success
the
most
difficult
problem
in
interest
is
arousing
the
interest
of
witnesses
because
this
is
purely
a
matter
of
training
receiving
the
attention
is
what
should
be
aimed
at
in
rousing
interest
inasmuch
as
full
attention
leads
to
correct
testimony
to
the
thing
most
important
to
our
tasks
interest
no
attention
says
volkmar
absolutely
new
does
not
stimulate
what
narrows
appreciation
narrows
attention
the
significant
thing
for
us
is
that
absolutely
new
does
not
a
matter
often
overlooked
if
i
tell
an
uneducated
man
with
all
signs
of
astonishment
that
the
missing
books
of
have
been
discovered
in
verona
or
that
a
completely
preserved
dinotherium
has
been
cut
out
of
the
ice
or
that
the
final
explanation
of
the
martian
canals
has
been
made
at
manora
observatory
all
this
very
interesting
news
will
leave
him
quite
cold
it
is
absolutely
new
to
him
he
does
not
know
what
it
means
or
how
to
get
hold
of
it
it
offers
him
no
matter
of
interest
i
should
have
a
similar
experience
if
in
the
course
of
a
big
case
i
told
a
man
educated
but
uninterested
in
the
case
with
joy
that
i
had
finally
discovered
the
important
note
on
which
the
explanation
of
the
events
depended
i
could
not
possibly
expect
interest
attention
and
comprehension
of
a
matter
if
my
interlocutor
knows
nothing
about
the
issue
or
the
reason
of
the
importance
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
everything
is
natural
and
can
be
explained
we
have
the
same
story
every
day
we
put
the
witness
a
definite
question
that
is
of
immense
importance
to
us
who
are
fully
acquainted
with
the
problem
but
is
for
the
witness
detached
incoherent
and
therefore
barren
of
interest
then
who
can
require
of
an
uninterested
witness
attention
and
effective
and
replies
i
myself
heard
a
witness
answer
a
judge
who
asked
him
about
the
weather
on
a
certain
day
here
to
drag
me
so
many
miles
to
this
place
in
order
to
discuss
the
weather
with
me
the
old
man
was
quite
right
because
the
detached
question
had
no
particular
purpose
but
when
it
was
circumstantially
explained
to
him
that
the
weather
was
of
uttermost
significance
in
this
case
how
it
was
related
thereto
and
how
important
his
answer
would
be
he
went
at
the
question
eagerly
and
did
everything
thinkable
in
trying
to
recall
the
weather
in
question
by
bringing
to
bear
various
associated
events
and
did
finally
make
a
decidedly
valuable
addition
to
the
evidence
and
this
is
the
only
way
to
capture
the
attention
of
a
witness
if
he
is
merely
ordered
to
pay
attention
the
result
is
the
same
as
if
he
were
ordered
to
speak
louder
he
does
it
in
lucky
cases
for
a
moment
and
then
goes
on
as
before
attention
may
be
generated
but
not
commanded
and
may
be
generated
successfully
with
everybody
and
at
all
times
if
only
the
proper
method
is
hit
upon
the
first
and
absolute
requirement
is
to
have
and
to
show
the
same
interest
oneself
for
it
is
impossible
to
infect
a
man
with
interest
when
you
have
no
interest
to
infect
with
there
is
nothing
more
deadly
or
boresome
than
to
see
how
witnesses
are
examined
sleepily
and
with
tedium
and
how
the
witnesses
similarly
infected
similarly
answer
on
the
other
hand
it
is
delightful
to
observe
the
surprising
effect
of
questions
asked
and
heard
with
interest
then
the
sleepiest
witnesses
even
dull
ones
wake
up
the
growth
of
their
interest
and
hence
of
their
attention
may
be
followed
step
by
step
they
actually
increase
in
knowledge
and
their
statements
gain
in
reliability
and
this
simply
because
they
have
seen
the
earnestness
of
the
judge
the
importance
of
the
issue
the
case
the
weighty
consequences
of
making
a
mistake
the
gain
in
truth
through
watchfulness
and
effort
the
avoidance
of
error
through
attention
in
this
way
the
most
useful
testimony
can
be
obtained
from
witnesses
who
in
the
beginning
showed
only
despairing
prospects
now
if
one
is
already
himself
endowed
with
keen
interest
and
resolved
to
awaken
the
same
in
the
witnesses
it
is
necessary
carefully
to
consider
the
method
of
so
doing
and
how
much
the
witness
is
to
be
told
of
what
has
already
been
established
or
merely
been
said
and
received
as
possibly
valuable
on
the
one
hand
it
is
true
that
the
witness
can
be
roused
to
attention
and
to
more
certain
and
vigorous
responses
according
to
the
quantity
of
detail
told
him
on
the
other
caution
and
other
considerations
warn
against
telling
an
unknown
witness
whose
trustworthiness
is
not
ascertained
delicate
and
important
matters
it
is
especially
difficult
if
the
witness
is
to
be
told
of
presuppositions
and
combinations
or
if
he
is
to
be
shown
how
the
case
would
alter
with
his
own
answer
the
last
especially
has
the
effect
of
suggestion
and
must
occur
in
particular
and
in
general
at
those
times
alone
when
his
statement
or
some
part
of
it
is
apparently
of
small
importance
but
actually
of
much
often
this
importance
can
be
made
clear
to
the
witness
only
by
showing
him
that
the
difference
in
the
effect
of
his
testimony
is
pointed
out
to
him
because
when
he
sees
it
he
will
find
it
worth
while
to
exert
himself
and
to
consider
carefully
his
answer
any
one
of
us
may
remember
that
a
witness
who
was
ready
with
a
prompt
and
to
him
an
indifferent
reply
started
thinking
and
gave
an
essentially
different
answer
even
contradictory
to
his
first
when
the
meaning
and
the
effect
of
what
he
might
say
was
made
clear
to
him
how
and
when
the
witness
is
to
be
told
things
there
is
no
rule
for
the
wise
adjustment
between
saying
enough
to
awaken
interest
and
not
too
much
to
cause
danger
is
a
very
important
question
of
tact
only
one
certain
device
may
be
recommended
it
is
better
to
be
careful
with
a
witness
during
his
preliminary
examination
and
to
keep
back
what
is
known
or
suspected
thus
the
attention
and
interest
of
the
witness
may
perhaps
be
stimulated
if
however
it
is
believed
that
fuller
information
may
increase
and
intensify
the
important
factors
under
examination
the
witness
is
to
be
recalled
later
when
it
is
safe
and
his
testimony
is
under
the
new
conditions
of
interest
to
be
corrected
and
rendered
more
useful
in
this
case
too
the
key
to
success
lies
in
increase
of
effort
but
that
is
true
in
all
departments
of
law
and
the
interest
of
a
witness
is
so
important
that
it
is
worth
the
effort
topic
iii
phenomenology
study
of
the
outward
expression
of
mental
states
section
phenomenology
is
in
general
the
science
of
appearances
in
our
usage
it
is
the
systematic
of
those
outer
symptoms
occasioned
by
inner
processes
and
conversely
the
inference
from
the
symptoms
to
them
broadly
construed
this
may
be
taken
as
the
study
of
the
habits
and
whole
bearing
of
any
individual
but
essentially
only
those
external
manifestations
can
be
considered
that
refer
back
to
definite
psychical
conditions
so
that
our
phenomenology
may
be
defined
as
the
semiotic
of
normal
psychology
this
science
is
legally
of
immense
importance
but
has
not
yet
assumed
the
task
of
showing
how
unquestionable
inferences
may
be
drawn
from
an
uncounted
collection
of
outward
appearances
to
inner
processes
in
addition
observations
are
not
numerous
enough
far
from
accurate
enough
and
psychological
research
not
advanced
enough
what
dangerous
mistakes
premature
use
of
such
things
may
lead
to
is
evident
in
the
teaching
of
the
italian
positivistic
school
which
defines
itself
also
as
psychopathic
semiotic
but
if
our
phenomenology
can
only
attempt
to
approximate
the
establishment
of
a
science
of
symptoms
it
may
at
least
study
critically
the
customary
popular
inferences
from
such
symptoms
and
reduce
exaggerated
theories
concerning
the
value
of
individual
symptoms
to
a
point
of
explanation
and
proof
it
might
seem
that
our
present
task
is
destructive
but
it
will
be
an
achievement
if
we
can
show
the
way
to
later
development
of
this
science
and
to
have
examined
and
set
aside
the
useless
material
already
to
hand
section
a
general
external
conditions
state
of
consciousness
has
its
physical
correlate
says
helmholtz
and
this
proposition
contains
the
all
in
all
of
our
problem
every
mental
event
must
have
its
corresponding
physical
event
in
some
form
and
is
therefore
capable
of
being
sensed
or
known
to
be
indicated
by
some
trace
identical
inner
states
do
not
of
course
invariably
have
identical
bodily
concomitants
neither
in
all
individuals
alike
nor
in
the
same
individual
at
different
times
modern
methods
of
generalization
so
invariably
involve
danger
and
incorrectness
that
one
can
not
be
too
cautious
in
this
matter
if
generalization
were
permissible
psychical
events
would
have
to
be
at
least
as
clear
as
physical
processes
but
that
is
not
admissible
for
many
reasons
first
of
all
physical
concomitants
are
rarely
direct
and
unmeditated
expressions
of
a
psychical
instant
clenching
a
fist
in
threatening
generally
they
stand
in
no
causal
relation
so
that
explanations
drawn
from
physiological
anatomical
or
even
atavistic
conditions
are
only
approximate
and
hypothetical
in
addition
accidental
habits
and
inheritances
exercise
an
influence
which
although
it
does
not
alter
the
expression
has
a
moulding
effect
that
in
the
course
of
time
does
finally
so
recast
a
very
natural
expression
as
to
make
it
altogether
unintelligible
the
phenomena
moreover
are
in
most
cases
personal
so
that
each
individual
means
a
new
study
again
the
phenomena
rarely
remain
constant
we
call
a
thing
habit
we
say
has
the
habit
of
clutching
his
chin
when
he
is
embarrassed
but
that
such
habits
change
is
well
known
furthermore
purely
physiological
conditions
operate
in
many
directions
such
as
blushing
trembling
laughter
weeping
stuttering
etc
and
finally
very
few
men
want
to
show
their
minds
openly
to
their
friends
so
that
they
see
no
reason
for
their
symbolic
bodily
expressions
nevertheless
they
do
so
and
not
since
yesterday
but
for
thousands
of
years
hence
definite
expressions
have
been
transmitted
for
generations
and
have
at
the
same
time
been
constantly
modified
until
they
are
altogether
unrecognizable
characteristically
the
desire
to
fool
others
has
also
its
predetermined
limitations
so
that
it
often
happens
that
simple
and
significant
gestures
contradict
words
when
the
latter
are
false
you
hear
somebody
say
went
down
but
see
him
point
at
the
same
time
not
clearly
but
visibly
here
the
speech
was
false
and
the
gesture
true
the
speaker
had
to
turn
all
his
attention
on
what
he
wanted
to
say
so
that
the
unwatched
moved
his
hand
in
some
degree
a
remarkable
case
of
this
kind
was
that
of
a
suspect
of
child
murder
the
girl
told
that
she
had
given
birth
to
the
child
all
alone
had
washed
it
and
then
laid
it
on
the
bed
beside
herself
she
had
also
observed
how
a
corner
of
the
coverlet
had
fallen
on
the
face
and
thought
it
might
interfere
with
the
breathing
but
at
this
point
she
swooned
was
unable
to
help
the
child
and
it
was
choked
while
sobbing
and
weeping
as
she
was
telling
this
story
she
spread
the
fingers
of
her
left
hand
and
pressed
it
on
her
thigh
as
perhaps
she
might
have
done
if
she
had
first
put
something
soft
the
corner
of
a
coverlet
possibly
over
the
nose
and
mouth
and
then
pressed
on
it
this
action
was
so
clearly
significant
that
it
inevitably
led
to
the
question
whether
she
choked
the
child
in
that
way
she
assented
sobbing
similar
is
another
case
in
which
a
man
assured
us
that
he
lived
very
peaceably
with
his
neighbor
and
at
the
same
time
clenched
his
fist
the
latter
meant
illwill
toward
the
neighbor
while
the
words
did
not
it
need
not
of
course
be
urged
that
the
certainty
of
a
belief
will
be
much
endangered
if
too
much
value
is
sanguinely
set
on
such
and
similar
gestures
when
their
observation
is
not
easy
there
is
enough
to
do
in
taking
testimony
and
enough
to
observe
to
make
it
difficult
to
watch
gestures
too
then
there
is
danger
because
of
slight
practice
of
easily
mistaking
indifferent
or
habitual
gestures
for
significant
ones
of
supposing
oneself
to
have
seen
more
than
should
have
been
seen
and
of
making
such
observations
too
noticeable
in
which
case
the
witness
immediately
controls
his
gestures
in
short
there
are
difficulties
but
once
they
are
surmounted
the
effort
to
do
so
is
not
regretted
it
is
to
be
recommended
here
also
not
to
begin
studies
with
murder
and
robbery
but
with
the
simple
cases
of
the
daily
life
where
there
is
no
danger
of
making
mistakes
and
where
observations
may
be
made
much
more
calmly
gestures
are
especially
powerful
habits
and
almost
everybody
makes
them
mainly
indifferent
ones
it
is
amusing
to
observe
a
man
at
the
telephone
his
free
hand
making
the
gestures
for
both
he
clenches
his
fist
threateningly
stretches
one
finger
after
another
into
the
air
if
he
is
counting
something
stamps
his
foot
if
he
is
angry
and
puts
his
finger
to
his
head
if
he
does
not
understand
in
that
he
behaves
as
he
would
if
his
interlocutor
were
before
him
such
tendencies
to
gesture
hardly
ever
leave
us
the
movements
also
occur
when
we
lie
and
inasmuch
as
a
man
who
is
lying
at
the
same
time
has
the
idea
of
the
truth
either
directly
or
subconsciously
before
him
it
is
conceivable
that
this
idea
exercises
much
greater
influence
on
gesture
than
the
probably
transitory
lie
the
question
therefore
is
one
of
intensity
for
each
gesture
requires
a
powerful
impulse
and
the
more
energetic
is
the
one
that
succeeds
in
causing
the
gesture
according
to
herbert
spencer
it
is
a
general
and
important
rule
that
any
sensation
which
exceeds
a
definite
intensity
expresses
itself
ordinarily
in
activity
of
the
body
this
fact
is
the
more
important
for
us
inasmuch
as
we
rarely
have
to
deal
with
light
and
with
not
and
superficial
sensations
in
most
cases
the
sensations
in
question
a
certain
intensity
so
that
we
are
able
to
perceive
a
bodily
expression
at
least
in
the
form
of
a
gesture
the
old
english
physician
charles
bell
is
of
the
opinion
in
his
cautious
way
that
what
is
called
the
external
sign
of
passion
is
only
the
accompanying
phenomenon
of
that
spontaneous
movement
required
by
the
structure
or
better
by
the
situation
of
the
body
later
this
was
demonstrated
by
darwin
and
his
friends
to
be
the
indubitable
starting
point
of
all
gesticulation
so
for
example
the
defensive
action
upon
hearing
something
disgusting
the
clenching
of
the
fists
in
anger
or
among
wild
animals
the
baring
of
the
teeth
or
the
dropping
of
the
head
etc
in
the
course
of
time
the
various
forms
of
action
became
largely
unintelligible
and
significatory
only
after
long
experience
it
became
moreover
differently
differentiated
with
each
individual
and
hence
still
more
difficult
to
understand
how
far
this
differentiation
may
go
when
it
has
endured
generation
after
generation
and
is
at
last
crystallized
into
a
set
type
is
well
known
just
as
by
training
the
muscles
of
porters
tumblers
or
fencers
develop
in
each
individual
so
the
muscles
develop
in
those
portions
of
our
body
most
animated
by
the
mind
in
our
face
and
hands
especially
have
there
occurred
through
the
centuries
fixed
expressions
or
types
of
movement
this
has
led
to
the
observations
of
which
speak
of
raw
animal
passionate
or
modest
faces
and
of
ordinary
nervous
or
spiritual
hands
but
it
has
also
led
to
the
scientific
interpretation
of
these
phenomena
which
afterwards
went
shipwreck
in
the
form
of
stigmata
inasmuch
as
an
overhasty
theory
has
been
built
on
barren
unexperienced
and
unstudied
material
the
notion
of
criminal
stigmata
is
however
in
no
sense
new
and
lombroso
has
not
invented
it
according
to
an
incidental
remark
of
kant
in
his
the
first
who
tried
scientifically
to
interpret
these
otherwise
ancient
observations
was
the
german
j
friedreich
who
says
expressly
that
determinate
somatic
pathological
phenomena
may
be
shown
to
occur
with
certain
moral
perversions
it
has
been
observed
with
approximate
clearness
in
several
types
of
cases
so
for
example
incendiarism
occurs
in
the
case
of
abnormal
sexual
conditions
poisoning
also
springs
from
abnormal
sexual
impulses
drowning
is
the
consequence
of
oversatiated
drink
mania
etc
modern
psychopathology
knows
nothing
additional
concerning
these
marvels
and
similar
matters
which
are
spoken
of
nowadays
again
have
shown
themselves
incapable
of
demonstration
but
that
there
are
phenomena
so
related
and
that
their
number
is
continually
increasing
under
exact
observations
is
not
open
to
doubt
if
we
stop
with
the
phenomena
of
daily
life
and
keep
in
mind
the
fact
that
everybody
recognizes
at
a
glance
the
old
hunter
the
retired
officer
the
actor
the
aristocratic
lady
we
may
go
still
further
the
more
trained
observers
can
recognize
the
merchant
the
official
the
butcher
the
the
real
tramp
the
greek
the
sexual
pervert
etc
hence
follows
an
important
law
if
a
fact
is
once
recognized
correctly
in
its
coarser
form
then
the
possibility
must
be
granted
that
it
is
correct
in
its
subtler
the
boundary
between
what
is
coarse
and
what
is
not
may
not
be
drawn
at
any
particular
point
it
varies
with
the
skill
of
the
observer
with
the
character
of
the
material
before
him
and
with
the
excellence
of
his
instruments
so
that
nobody
can
say
where
the
possibility
of
progress
in
the
matter
ceases
something
must
be
granted
in
all
questions
appertaining
to
this
subject
of
recognizable
and
every
layman
pursues
daily
certain
activities
based
on
their
existence
when
he
speaks
of
stupid
and
intelligent
faces
he
is
a
physiognomist
he
sees
that
there
are
intellectual
foreheads
and
microcephalic
ones
and
is
thus
a
craniologist
he
observes
the
expression
of
fear
and
of
joy
and
so
observes
the
principles
of
imitation
he
contemplates
a
fine
and
elegant
hand
in
contrast
with
a
fat
and
mean
hand
and
therefore
assents
to
the
effectiveness
of
chirognomy
he
finds
one
scholarly
and
fluid
another
heavy
ornate
and
unpleasant
so
he
is
dealing
with
the
first
principles
of
graphology
all
these
observations
and
inferences
are
nowhere
denied
and
nobody
can
say
where
their
attainable
boundaries
lie
hence
the
only
proper
point
of
view
to
take
is
that
from
which
we
set
aside
as
too
bold
all
daring
and
undemonstrated
assertions
on
these
matters
but
we
will
equally
beware
of
asserting
without
further
consideration
that
statements
are
unjustified
for
we
shall
get
very
far
by
the
use
of
keener
and
more
careful
observation
richer
material
and
better
instruments
how
fine
for
example
are
the
observations
made
by
herbert
spencer
concerning
the
importance
of
the
of
speech
in
the
light
of
the
emotional
state
no
one
had
ever
thought
of
that
before
or
considered
the
possibilities
of
gaining
anything
of
importance
from
this
single
datum
which
has
since
yielded
such
a
rich
collection
of
completely
proved
and
correctly
founded
results
darwin
knew
well
enough
to
make
use
of
it
for
his
own
purposes
he
points
out
that
the
person
who
is
quietly
complaining
of
bad
treatment
or
is
suffering
a
little
almost
always
speaks
in
a
high
tone
of
voice
and
that
deep
groans
or
high
and
piercing
shrieks
indicate
extreme
pain
now
we
lawyers
can
make
just
such
observations
in
great
number
any
one
of
us
who
has
had
a
few
experiences
can
immediately
recognize
from
the
tone
of
voice
with
which
a
new
comer
makes
his
requests
just
about
what
he
wants
the
accused
for
example
who
by
chance
does
not
know
why
he
has
been
called
to
court
makes
use
of
a
questioning
tone
without
really
pronouncing
his
question
anybody
who
is
seriously
wounded
speaks
hoarsely
and
abruptly
the
secret
tone
of
voice
of
the
querulous
and
of
such
people
who
speak
evil
of
another
when
they
are
only
half
or
not
at
all
convinced
of
it
gives
them
away
the
voice
of
a
denying
criminal
has
in
hundreds
of
cases
been
proved
through
a
large
number
of
physiological
phenomena
to
do
the
same
thing
for
him
the
stimulation
of
the
nerves
influences
before
all
the
characteristic
snapping
movement
of
the
mouth
which
alternates
with
the
reflex
tendency
to
swallow
in
addition
it
causes
lapses
in
blood
pressure
and
palpitation
of
the
heart
by
means
of
disturbances
of
the
heart
action
and
this
shows
clearly
visible
palpitation
of
the
right
carotid
well
within
the
breadth
of
hand
under
the
ear
in
the
middle
of
the
right
side
of
the
neck
that
the
left
carotid
does
not
show
the
palpitation
may
be
based
on
the
fact
that
the
right
stands
in
much
more
direct
connection
with
the
aorta
all
this
taken
together
causes
that
so
significant
lightly
vibrating
cold
and
toneless
voice
which
is
so
often
to
be
perceived
in
criminals
who
deny
their
guilt
it
rarely
deceives
the
expert
but
these
various
timbres
of
the
voice
especially
contain
a
not
insignificant
danger
for
the
criminalist
whoever
once
has
devoted
himself
to
the
study
of
them
trusts
them
altogether
too
easily
for
even
if
he
has
identified
them
correctly
hundreds
of
times
it
still
may
happen
that
he
is
completely
deceived
by
a
voice
he
holds
as
that
timbres
may
deceive
or
simulations
worthy
of
the
name
occur
i
hardly
believe
such
deceptions
are
often
attempted
and
begun
but
they
demand
the
entire
attention
of
the
person
who
tries
them
and
that
can
be
given
for
only
a
short
time
in
the
very
instant
that
the
matter
he
is
speaking
of
requires
the
attention
of
the
speaker
his
voice
involuntarily
falls
into
that
tone
demanded
by
its
physical
determinants
and
the
speaker
significantly
betrays
himself
through
just
this
alteration
we
may
conclude
that
an
effective
simulation
is
hardly
thinkable
it
must
however
be
noticed
that
earlier
mistaken
observations
and
incorrect
inference
at
the
present
moment
substitutions
and
similar
mistakes
may
easily
mislead
as
a
corroborative
fact
then
the
judgment
of
a
voice
would
have
great
value
but
as
a
means
in
itself
it
is
a
thing
too
little
studied
and
far
from
confirmed
there
is
however
another
aspect
of
the
matter
which
manifests
itself
in
an
opposite
way
from
voice
and
gesture
lazarus
calls
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
spectators
at
a
fencing
match
can
not
prevent
themselves
from
imitative
accompaniment
of
the
actions
of
the
fencers
and
that
anybody
who
happens
to
have
any
swinging
object
in
his
hand
moves
his
hand
here
and
there
as
they
do
stricker
makes
similar
observations
concerning
involuntary
movements
performed
while
looking
at
drilling
or
marching
soldiers
many
other
phenomena
of
the
daily
life
as
for
example
keeping
step
with
some
pedestrian
near
us
with
the
movement
of
a
pitcher
who
with
all
sorts
of
twistings
of
his
body
wants
to
guide
the
ball
correctly
when
it
has
already
long
ago
left
his
hand
keeping
time
to
music
and
accompanying
the
rhythm
of
a
wagon
knocking
on
cobblestones
even
the
enforcement
of
what
is
said
through
appropriate
gestures
when
people
speak
vivaciously
naturally
belong
to
the
same
class
so
do
nodding
the
head
in
agreement
and
shaking
it
in
denial
shrugging
the
shoulders
with
a
declaration
of
ignorance
the
expression
by
word
of
mouth
should
have
been
enough
and
have
needed
no
reinforcement
through
conventional
gestures
but
the
last
are
spontaneously
involuntary
accompaniments
on
the
other
hand
there
is
the
converse
fact
that
the
voice
may
be
influenced
through
expression
and
gesture
if
we
fix
an
expression
on
our
features
or
bring
our
body
into
an
attitude
which
involves
passional
excitement
we
may
be
sure
that
we
will
be
affected
more
or
less
by
the
appropriate
emotion
this
statement
formulated
by
maudsley
is
perfectly
true
and
may
be
proved
by
anybody
at
any
moment
it
presents
itself
to
us
as
an
effective
corroboration
of
the
so
phenomenon
of
suppose
you
correctly
imagine
how
a
very
angry
man
looks
frowning
brow
clenched
fists
gritting
teeth
hoarse
gasping
voice
and
suppose
you
imitate
then
even
if
you
feel
most
harmless
and
you
become
quite
angry
though
you
keep
up
the
imitation
only
a
little
while
by
means
of
the
imitation
of
lively
bodily
changes
you
may
in
the
same
way
bring
yourself
into
any
conceivable
emotional
condition
the
outer
expressions
of
which
appear
energetically
it
must
have
occurred
to
every
one
of
us
how
often
prisoners
present
so
well
the
excitement
of
passion
that
their
earnestness
is
actually
believed
as
for
example
the
anger
of
a
guiltless
suspect
or
of
an
obviously
needy
person
of
a
man
financially
ruined
by
his
trusted
servant
etc
such
scenes
of
passion
happen
daily
in
every
and
they
are
so
excellently
presented
that
even
an
experienced
judge
believes
in
their
reality
and
tells
himself
that
such
a
thing
can
not
be
imitated
because
the
imitation
is
altogether
too
hard
to
do
and
still
harder
to
maintain
but
in
reality
the
presentation
is
not
so
wonderful
and
taken
altogether
is
not
at
all
skilful
whoever
wants
to
manifest
must
make
the
proper
gestures
and
that
requires
no
art
and
when
he
makes
the
gestures
the
necessary
conditions
occur
and
these
stimulate
and
cause
the
correct
manifestation
of
the
later
gestures
while
these
again
influence
the
voice
thus
without
any
essential
mummery
the
comedy
plays
itself
out
correct
convincing
alarming
oneself
is
not
performed
by
words
but
by
the
reciprocal
influence
of
word
and
gesture
and
the
power
of
that
influence
is
observable
in
the
large
number
of
cases
where
in
the
end
people
themselves
believe
what
they
have
invented
if
they
are
of
delicate
spiritual
equilibrium
they
even
become
hypochondriacs
writing
and
the
reading
of
writing
is
to
be
considered
in
the
same
way
as
gesticulation
it
has
the
same
alarming
influence
on
voice
and
general
appearance
as
the
other
so
that
it
is
relatively
indifferent
whether
a
man
speaks
and
acts
or
writes
and
thinks
this
fact
is
well
known
to
everybody
who
has
ever
in
his
life
written
a
really
coarse
letter
now
this
exciting
gesticulation
can
be
very
easily
observed
but
the
observation
must
not
come
too
late
if
the
witness
is
once
quite
lost
in
it
and
sufficiently
excited
by
the
concomitant
speeches
he
will
make
his
gestures
well
and
naturally
and
the
artificial
and
untrue
will
not
be
discoverable
but
this
is
not
the
case
in
the
beginning
then
his
gestures
are
actually
not
skilful
and
at
that
point
a
definite
force
of
will
and
rather
notable
exaggerations
are
observable
the
gestures
go
further
than
the
words
and
that
is
a
matter
not
difficult
to
recognize
as
soon
as
the
recognition
is
made
it
becomes
necessary
to
examine
whether
a
certain
congruity
invariably
manifests
itself
between
word
and
gesture
inasmuch
as
with
many
people
the
lack
of
congruity
is
habitual
and
honest
this
is
particularly
the
case
with
people
who
are
somewhat
theatrical
and
hence
gesticulate
too
much
but
if
word
and
gesture
soon
conform
one
to
another
especially
after
a
rather
lively
presentation
you
may
be
certain
that
the
subject
has
skilfully
worked
himself
into
his
alarm
or
whatever
it
is
he
wanted
to
manifest
quite
apart
from
the
importance
of
seeing
such
a
matter
clearly
the
interest
of
the
work
is
a
rich
reward
for
the
labor
involved
in
close
relation
to
these
phenomena
is
the
change
of
color
to
which
unfortunately
great
importance
is
often
assigned
in
this
regard
paling
has
received
less
general
attention
because
it
is
more
rare
and
less
suspicious
that
it
can
not
be
simulated
as
is
frequently
asserted
in
discussions
of
simulation
especially
of
epilepsy
is
not
true
inasmuch
as
there
exists
an
especial
physiological
process
which
succeeds
in
causing
pallor
artificially
in
that
experiment
the
chest
is
very
forcibly
contracted
the
glottis
is
closed
and
the
muscles
used
in
inspiration
are
contracted
this
matter
has
no
practical
value
for
us
on
the
one
hand
because
the
trick
is
always
involved
with
lively
and
obvious
efforts
and
on
the
other
because
cases
are
hardly
thinkable
in
which
a
man
will
produce
artificial
pallor
in
the
court
where
it
can
not
be
of
any
use
to
him
the
one
possibility
of
use
is
in
the
simulation
of
epilepsy
and
in
such
a
case
the
trick
can
not
be
played
because
of
the
necessary
falling
to
the
ground
paling
depends
as
is
well
known
on
the
cramp
of
the
muscles
of
the
veins
which
contract
and
so
cause
a
narrowing
of
their
bore
which
hinders
the
flow
of
blood
but
such
cramps
happen
only
in
cases
of
considerable
anger
fear
pain
trepidation
rage
in
short
in
cases
of
excitement
that
nobody
ever
has
reason
to
simulate
paling
has
no
value
in
differentiation
inasmuch
as
a
man
might
grow
pale
in
the
face
through
fear
of
being
unmasked
or
in
rage
at
unjust
suspicion
the
same
thing
is
true
about
blushing
it
consists
in
a
sort
of
transitory
crippling
of
those
nerves
that
end
in
the
walls
of
small
arteries
this
causes
the
relaxation
of
the
of
the
blood
vessels
which
are
consequently
filled
in
a
greater
degree
with
blood
blushing
also
may
be
voluntarily
created
by
some
individuals
in
that
case
the
chest
is
fully
expanded
the
glottis
is
closed
and
the
muscles
of
expiration
are
contracted
but
this
matter
again
has
no
particular
value
for
us
since
the
simulation
of
a
blush
is
at
most
of
use
only
when
a
woman
wants
to
appear
quite
modest
and
moral
but
for
that
effect
artificial
blushing
does
not
help
since
it
requires
such
intense
effort
as
to
be
immediately
noticeable
blushing
by
means
of
external
assistance
inhaling
certain
chemicals
is
a
thing
hardly
anybody
will
want
to
perform
before
the
court
with
regard
to
guilt
or
innocence
blushing
offers
no
evidence
whatever
there
is
a
great
troop
of
people
who
blush
without
any
reason
for
feeling
guilty
the
most
instructive
thing
in
this
matter
is
and
whoever
recalls
the
cause
of
his
own
blushing
will
value
the
phenomenon
lightly
enough
i
myself
belonged
not
only
as
a
child
but
also
long
after
my
student
days
to
those
unfortunates
who
grow
quite
without
reason
i
needed
only
to
hear
of
some
shameful
deed
of
theft
robbery
murder
and
i
would
get
so
red
that
a
spectator
might
believe
that
i
was
one
of
the
criminals
in
my
native
city
there
was
an
old
maid
who
had
i
knew
even
as
a
boy
remained
single
because
of
unrequited
love
of
my
grandfather
she
seemed
to
me
a
very
poetical
figure
and
once
when
her
really
magnificent
ugliness
was
discussed
i
took
up
her
cause
and
declared
her
to
be
not
so
bad
my
taste
was
laughed
at
and
since
then
whenever
this
lady
or
the
street
she
lives
in
or
even
her
furs
she
used
to
have
pleasure
in
wearing
costly
furs
were
spoken
of
i
would
blush
and
her
age
may
be
estimated
from
her
now
what
has
occurred
to
me
often
painfully
happens
to
numbers
of
people
and
it
is
hence
inconceivable
why
forensic
value
is
still
frequently
assigned
to
blushing
at
the
same
time
there
are
a
few
cases
in
which
blushing
may
be
important
the
matter
is
interesting
even
though
we
know
nothing
about
the
intrinsic
inner
process
which
leads
to
the
influence
on
the
nervous
filaments
blushing
occurs
all
the
world
over
and
its
occasion
and
process
is
the
same
among
savages
as
among
us
the
same
events
may
be
observed
whether
we
compare
the
flush
of
educated
or
uneducated
there
is
the
notion
which
i
believed
for
a
long
time
that
blushing
occurs
among
educated
people
and
is
especially
rare
among
peasants
but
that
does
not
seem
to
be
true
working
people
especially
those
who
are
out
in
the
open
a
good
deal
have
a
tougher
pigmentation
and
a
browner
skin
so
that
their
flush
is
less
obvious
but
it
occurs
as
often
and
under
the
same
conditions
as
among
others
it
might
be
said
for
the
same
reason
that
gypsies
never
blush
and
of
course
that
the
blush
may
be
rarer
among
people
lacking
in
shame
and
a
sense
of
honor
is
conceivable
yet
everybody
who
has
much
to
do
with
gypsies
asserts
that
the
blush
may
be
observed
among
them
concerning
the
relation
of
the
blush
to
age
darwin
says
that
early
childhood
knows
nothing
about
blushing
it
happens
in
youth
more
frequently
than
in
old
age
and
oftener
among
women
than
among
men
idiots
blush
seldom
blind
people
and
hereditary
albinos
a
great
deal
the
somatic
process
of
blushing
is
as
darwin
shows
quite
remarkable
almost
always
the
blush
is
preceded
by
a
quick
contraction
of
the
eyelids
as
if
to
prevent
the
rise
of
the
blood
in
the
eyes
after
that
in
most
cases
the
eyes
are
dropped
even
when
the
cause
of
blushing
is
anger
or
vexation
finally
the
blush
rises
in
most
cases
irregularly
and
in
spots
at
last
to
cover
the
skin
uniformly
if
you
want
to
save
the
witness
his
blush
you
can
do
it
only
at
the
beginning
during
the
movement
of
the
eyes
and
only
by
taking
no
notice
of
it
by
not
looking
at
him
and
going
right
on
with
your
remarks
this
incidentally
is
valuable
inasmuch
as
many
people
are
much
confused
by
blushing
and
really
do
not
know
what
they
are
talking
about
while
doing
it
there
is
no
third
thing
which
is
the
cause
of
the
blush
and
of
the
confusion
the
blush
itself
is
the
cause
of
the
confusion
this
may
be
indubitably
confirmed
by
anybody
who
has
the
agreeable
property
of
blushing
and
therefore
is
of
some
experience
in
the
matter
i
should
never
dare
to
make
capital
of
any
statement
made
during
the
blush
friedreich
calls
attention
to
the
fact
that
people
who
are
for
the
first
time
subject
to
the
procedure
of
the
law
courts
blush
and
lose
color
more
easily
than
such
as
are
accustomed
to
it
so
that
the
unaccustomed
scene
also
contributes
to
the
confusion
meynert
states
the
matter
explicitly
blush
always
depends
upon
a
in
which
the
complete
saturation
of
the
nervous
elements
constricts
the
orderly
movement
of
the
mental
process
inasmuch
as
here
also
the
simplicity
of
activities
of
the
brain
determines
the
scope
of
the
function
of
how
convincing
this
definition
is
becomes
clear
on
considering
the
processes
in
question
let
us
think
of
some
person
accused
of
a
crime
to
whom
the
ground
of
accusation
is
presented
for
the
first
time
and
to
whom
the
judge
after
that
presents
the
skilfully
constructed
proof
of
his
guilt
by
means
of
individual
bits
of
evidence
now
think
of
the
mass
of
thoughts
here
excited
even
if
the
accused
is
innocent
the
deed
itself
is
foreign
to
him
he
must
imagine
that
should
any
relation
to
it
presence
at
the
place
where
the
deed
was
done
interest
in
it
ownership
of
the
object
etc
be
present
to
his
mind
he
must
become
clear
concerning
this
relationship
while
at
the
same
time
the
possibilities
of
excuse
alibi
ownership
of
the
thing
storm
upon
him
then
only
does
he
consider
the
particular
reasons
of
suspicion
which
he
must
in
some
degree
incarnate
and
represent
in
their
dangerous
character
and
for
each
of
which
he
must
find
a
separate
excuse
we
have
here
some
several
dozens
of
which
start
their
movement
at
the
same
time
and
through
each
other
if
at
that
time
an
especially
dangerous
apparent
proof
is
brought
and
if
the
accused
recognizing
this
danger
blushes
with
fear
the
examiner
thinks
i
have
caught
the
rascal
for
blushing
now
go
ahead
quickly
speed
the
examination
and
enter
the
confused
answer
in
the
protocol
and
who
believes
the
accused
when
later
on
he
withdraws
the
and
asserts
that
he
had
said
the
thing
because
they
had
mixed
him
up
in
this
notion
blush
therefore
you
have
lied
you
did
it
lie
many
sins
the
commission
of
which
is
begun
at
the
time
of
admonishing
little
children
and
ended
with
obtaining
the
of
the
murderous
thief
finally
it
is
not
to
be
forgotten
that
there
are
cases
of
blushing
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
psychical
processes
ludwig
meyer
calls
it
better
developed
and
narrates
the
case
of
women
who
could
develop
a
blush
with
the
least
touch
of
friction
of
the
face
on
a
pillow
rubbing
with
the
hand
etc
and
this
blush
could
not
be
distinguished
from
the
ordinary
we
may
easily
consider
that
such
lightly
irritable
women
may
be
accused
come
before
the
court
without
being
recognized
as
such
and
for
example
cover
their
faces
with
their
hands
and
blush
then
the

might
be
called

friedrich
gerst√§cker
in
one
of
his
most
delightful
moods
says
somewhere
that
the
best
characteristicon
of
a
man
is
how
he
wears
his
hat
if
he
wears
it
perpendicular
he
is
honest
pedantic
and
boresome
if
he
wears
it
tipped
slightly
he
belongs
to
the
best
and
most
interesting
people
is
and
pleasant
a
deeply
tipped
hat
indicates
frivolity
and
obstinate
imperious
nature
a
hat
worn
on
the
back
of
the
head
signifies
improvidence
easiness
conceit
sensuality
and
extravagance
the
farther
back
the
more
dangerous
is
the
position
of
the
wearer
the
man
who
presses
his
hat
against
his
temples
complains
is
melancholy
and
in
a
bad
way
it
is
now
many
years
since
i
have
read
this
exposition
by
the
and
experienced
author
and
i
have
thought
countless
times
how
right
he
was
but
also
how
there
may
be
numberless
similar
marks
of
recognition
which
show
as
much
as
the
manner
of
wearing
a
hat
there
are
plenty
of
similar
expositions
to
be
known
one
man
seeks
to
recognize
the
nature
of
others

their
manner
of
wearing
and

lazarus
has
rightly
called
to
mind
what
is
told
by
the
pious
chr
von

concerning
the

boy
who
lies
under

and
recognizes

this
significant
story
shows
us
how
easy
it
is
with
a
little
observation
to
perceive
things
that
might
otherwise
have
been
hidden
with
what
subtle
clearness
it
shows
how
effective
is
the
egoism
which
makes
each
man
first
of
all
and
in
most
cases
exclusively
perceive
what
most
concerns
him
as
most
prominent
and
in
addition
men
so
eagerly
and
often
present
us
the
chance
for
the
deepest
insight
into
their
souls
that
we
need
only
to
open
our
eyes
seeing
and
interpreting
is
so
childishly
easy
each
one
of
us
experiences
almost
daily
the
most
instructive
things
through
the
window
of
my
study
i
could
look
into
a
great
garden
in
which
a
house
was
being
built
when
the
carpenters
left
in
the
evening
they
put
two
blocks
at
the
entrance
and
put
a
board
on
them
crosswise
later
there
came
each
evening
a
gang
of
youngsters
who
found
in
this
place
a
welcome
playground
that
obstruction
which
they
had
to
pass
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
notice
the
expression
of
their
characters
one
ran
quickly
and
jumped
easily
over
that
one
will
progress
easily
and
quickly
in
his
life
another
approached
carefully
climbed
slowly
up
the
board
and
as
cautiously
descended
on
the
other
side
careful
thoughtful
and
certain
the
third
climbed
up
and
jumped
down
a
deed
purposeless
incidental
uninforming
the
fourth
ran
energetically
to
the
obstruction
then
stopped
and
crawled
boldly
underneath
disgusting
boy
who
nevertheless
will
have
carried
his
job
ahead
then
again
there
came
a
fifth
who
jumped
but
too
low
remained
hanging
and
tumbled
he
got
up
rubbed
his
knee
went
back
ran
again
and
came
over
magnificently
and
how
magnificently
will
he
achieve
all
things
in
life
for
he
has
will
fearlessness
and
courageous
endurance
he
sink
finally
a
sixth
came
storming
along
one
step
and
board
and
blocks
fell
together
crashing
but
he
proudly
ran
over
the
obstruction
and
those
who
came
behind
him
made
use
of
the
open
way
he
is
of
the
people
who
go
through
life
as
we
get
our
great
men
from
among
such
well
all
this
is
just
a
game
and
no
one
would
dare
to
draw
conclusions
concerning
our
so
serious
work
from
such
observations
merely
but
they
can
have
a
corroborative
value
if
they
are
well
done
when
large
numbers
and
not
an
isolated
few
are
brought
together
and
when
appropriate
analogies
are
brought
from
appropriate
cases
such
studies
which
have
to
be
sought
in
the
daily
life
itself
permit
easy
development
if
observations
have
been
clearly
made
correctly
apprehended
and
if
especially
the
proper
notions
have
been
drawn
from
them
they
are
easily
to
be
observed
stick
in
the
memory
and
come
willingly
at
the
right
moment
but
they
must
then
serve
only
as
indices
they
must
only
suggest
the
case
is
the
same
and
that
means
a
good
deal
a
point
of
view
for
the
taking
of
evidence
is
established
not
of
course
proof
as
such
or
a
bit
of
evidence
but
a
way
of
receiving
it
perhaps
a
false
one
but
if
one
proceeds
carefully
along
this
way
it
shows
its
falseness
immediately
and
another
presented
by
memory
shows
us
another
way
that
is
perhaps
correct
the
most
important
thing
in
this
matter
is
to
get
a
general
view
of
the
human
specimen
and
incidentally
nobody
needs
more
to
do
this
than
the
criminalist
for
most
of
us
the
person
before
us
is
only
suspected
of
but
our
man
is
rather
more
than
that
and
especially
he
was
rather
more
before
he
became
suspected
of
hence
the
greatest
mistake
and
unfortunately
the
commonest
committed
by
the
judge
is
his
failure
to
discuss
with
the
prisoner
his
more
or
less
necessary
earlier
life
is
it
not
known
that
every
deed
is
an
outcome
of
the
total
character
of
the
doer
is
it
not
considered
that
deed
and
character
are
correlative
concepts
and
that
the
character
by
means
of
which
the
deed
is
to
be
established
can
not
be
inferred
from
the
deed
alone
is
the
product
of
the
physiologically
grounded
psyche
of
the
criminal
and
his
environing
external
liszt
each
particular
deed
is
thinkable
only
when
a
determinate
character
of
the
doer
is
brought
in
relation
with
it
a
certain
character
predisposes
to
determinate
deeds
another
character
makes
them
unthinkable
and
unrelatable
with
this
or
that
person
but
who
thinks
to
know
the
character
of
a
man
without
knowing
his
view
of
the
world
and
who
talks
of
their
with
his
criminals
wants
to
learn
to
know
men
says
hippel
judge
them
according
to
their
wishes
and
it
is
the
opinion
of
struve
belief
indicates
his
but
who
of
us
asks
his
criminals
about
their
wishes
and
beliefs
if
we
grant
the
correctness
of
what
we
have
said
we
gain
the
conviction
that
we
can
proceed
with
approximate
certainty
and
conscientiousness
only
if
we
speak
with
the
criminal
not
alone
concerning
the
deed
immediately
in
question
but
also
searchingly
concerning
the
important
conditions
of
his
inner
life
so
we
may
as
far
as
possible
see
clearly
what
he
is
according
to
general
notions
and
his
particular
relationships
the
same
thing
must
also
be
done
with
regard
to
an
important
witness
especially
when
much
depends
upon
his
way
of
judging
of
experiencing
of
feeling
and
of
thinking
and
when
it
is
impossible
to
discover
these
things
otherwise
of
course
such
analyses
are
often
tiring
and
without
result
but
that
on
the
other
hand
they
lay
open
with
few
words
whole
broadsides
of
physical
conditions
so
that
we
need
no
longer
doubt
is
also
a
matter
of
course
who
wants
to
leave
unused
a
formula
of
discover
what
we
are
through
what
we
do
nothing
is
easier
than
to
discover
from
some
person
important
to
us
what
he
does
even
though
the
discovery
develops
merely
as
a
simple
conversation
about
what
he
has
done
until
now
and
what
he
did
lately
and
up
to
date
we
have
gotten
at
such
courses
of
life
only
in
the
great
cases
in
cases
of
murder
or
important
political
criminals
and
then
only
at
externals
we
have
cared
little
about
the
essential
deeds
the
smaller
forms
of
activity
which
are
always
the
significant
ones
suppose
we
allow
some
man
to
speak
about
others
no
matter
whom
on
condition
that
he
must
know
them
well
he
judges
their
deeds
praises
and
condemns
them
and
thinks
that
he
is
talking
about
them
but
is
really
talking
about
himself
alone
for
in
each
judgment
of
the
others
he
aims
to
justify
and
enhance
himself
the
things
he
praises
he
does
what
he
finds
fault
with
he
does
not
or
at
least
he
wishes
people
to
believe
that
he
does
the
former
and
avoids
the
latter
and
when
he
speaks
unpleasantly
about
his
friends
he
has
simply
abandoned
what
he
formerly
had
in
common
with
them
then
again
he
scolds
at
those
who
have
gotten
on
and
blames
their
evil
nature
for
it
but
whoever
looks
more
closely
may
perceive
that
he
had
no
gain
in
the
same
evil
and
therefore
dislikes
it
at
the
same
time
he
can
not
possibly
suppress
what
he
wishes
and
what
he
needs
now
whoever
knows
this
fact
knows
his
motives
and
to
decide
in
view
of
these
with
regard
to
a
crime
is
seldom
difficult
besoins
sont
nos
but
superficial
needs
do
not
really
excite
us
while
what
is
an
actual
need
does
once
we
are
compelled
our
power
to
achieve
what
we
want
grows
astoundingly
how
we
wonder
at
the
great
amount
of
power
used
up
in
the
case
of
many
criminals
if
we
know
that
a
real
need
was
behind
the
crime
we
need
no
longer
wonder
at
the
magnitude
of
the
power
the
relation
between
the
crime
and
the
criminal
is
defined
because
we
have
discovered
his
needs
to
these
needs
a
pleasures
belong
also
every
man
until
the
practically
complete
loss
of
vigor
has
as
a
rule
a
very
obvious
need
for
some
kind
of
pleasure
it
is
human
nature
not
to
be
continuously
a
machine
to
require
relief
and
pleasure
the
word
pleasure
must
of
course
be
used
in
the
loosest
way
for
one
man
finds
his
pleasure
in
sitting
beside
the
stove
or
in
the
shadow
while
another
speaks
of
pleasure
only
when
he
can
bring
some
change
in
his
work
i
consider
it
impossible
not
to
understand
a
man
whose
pleasures
are
known
his
will
his
power
his
striving
and
knowing
feeling
and
perceiving
can
not
be
made
clearer
by
any
other
thing
moreover
it
happens
that
it
is
a
pleasures
which
bring
him
into
court
and
as
he
resists
or
falls
into
them
he
reveals
his
character
the
famous
author
of
the
of
christ
thomas
√†
kempis
whose
book
is
saving
the
bible
the
most
on
earth
says
hominem
fragilem
non
faciunt
sed
qualis
sit
that
is
a
golden
maxim
for
the
criminalist
opportunity
the
chance
to
taste
is
close
to
every
man
countless
times
is
his
greatest
danger
for
that
reason
it
was
great
wisdom
in
the
bible
that
called
the
devil
the
tempter
a
behavior
with
regard
to
the
discovered
or
opportunity
exhibits
his
character
wholly
and
completely
but
the
chance
to
observe
men
face
to
face
with
opportunity
is
a
rare
one
and
that
with
which
we
are
concerned
is
often
the
outcome
of
such
an
opportunity
but
at
this
point
we
ought
not
longer
to
learn
but
to
know
and
hence
our
duty
to
study
the
pleasures
of
men
to
know
how
they
behave
in
the
presence
of
their
opportunities
there
is
another
group
of
conditions
through
which
you
may
observe
and
judge
men
in
general
the
most
important
one
is
to
know
yourself
as
well
as
possible
for
accurate
leads
to
deep
mistrust
with
regard
to
others
and
only
the
man
suspicious
with
regard
to
others
is
insured
at
least
a
little
against
mistakes
to
pass
from
mistrust
to
the
reception
of
something
good
is
not
difficult
even
in
cases
where
the
mistrust
is
and
the
presupposition
of
excellent
motives
among
our
fellows
is
strongly
fought
nevertheless
when
something
actually
good
is
perceivable
one
is
convinced
by
it
and
even
made
happy
but
the
converse
is
not
true
for
anybody
who
is
too
trusting
easily
presupposes
the
best
at
every
opportunity
though
he
may
have
been
deceived
a
thousand
times
and
is
now
deceived
again
how
it
happens
that
leads
to
suspicion
of
others
we
had
better
not
investigate
too
closely
it
is
a
fact
every
man
is
characterized
by
the
way
he
behaves
in
regard
to
his
promises
i
do
not
mean
keeping
or
breaking
a
promise
because
nobody
doubts
that
the
honest
man
keeps
it
and
the
scoundrel
does
not
i
mean
the
in
which
a
promise
is
kept
and
the
in
which
it
is
kept
la
says
significantly
promise
according
to
our
hopes
and
perform
according
to
our
when
in
any
given
case
promising
and
hopes
and
performance
and
fears
are
compared
important
considerations
arise
especially
in
cases
of
complicity
in
crime
when
it
is
at
all
possible
and
in
most
cases
it
is
one
ought
to
concern
oneself
with
a
style
the
handwriting
of
his
soul
what
this
consists
of
can
not
be
expressed
in
a
definite
way
the
style
must
simply
be
studied
and
tested
with
regard
to
its
capacity
for
being
united
with
certain
presupposed
qualities
everybody
knows
that
education
and
intelligence
are
indubitably
expressed
in
style
but
it
may
also
be
observed
that
style
clearly
expresses
softness
or
hardness
of
a
character
kindness
or
cruelty
determination
or
weakness
integrity
or
carelessness
and
hundreds
of
other
qualities
generally
the
purpose
of
studying
style
may
be
achieved
by
keeping
in
mind
some
definite
quality
presupposed
and
by
asking
oneself
while
reading
the
manuscript
of
the
person
in
question
whether
this
quality
fuses
with
the
form
and
with
the
individual
tendencies
and
relationships
that
occur
in
the
construction
of
the
thought
one
reading
will
of
course
not
bring
you
far
but
if
the
reading
is
repeated
and
taken
up
anew
especially
as
often
as
the
writer
is
met
with
or
as
often
as
some
new
fact
about
him
is
established
then
it
is
almost
impossible
not
to
attain
a
fixed
and
valuable
result
one
gets
then
significantly
the
sudden
impression
that
the
thing
to
be
proved
having
the
expression
of
which
the
properties
are
to
be
established
rises
out
of
the
manuscript
and
when
that
happens
the
time
has
come
not
to
dawdle
with
the
work
repeated
reading
causes
the
picture
to
come
out
more
clearly
and
sharply
it
is
soon
seen
in
what
places
or
directions
of
the
manuscript
that
expression
comes
to
light
these
places
are
grouped
together
others
are
sought
that
more
or
less
imply
it
and
soon
a
standpoint
for
further
consideration
is
reached
which
naturally
is
not
evidential
by
itself
but
has
when
combined
with
numberless
others
corroborative
value
certain
small
apparently
indifferent
qualities
and
habits
are
important
there
are
altogether
too
many
of
them
to
talk
about
but
there
are
examples
enough
of
the
significance
of
what
is
said
of
a
man
in
this
fashion
man
is
never
late
man
never
forgets
man
invariably
carries
a
pencil
or
a
pocket
knife
one
is
always
perfumed
one
always
wears
clean
carefully
brushed
clothes
whoever
has
the
least
training
may
construct
out
of
such
qualities
the
whole
inner
life
of
the
individual
such
observations
may
often
be
learned
from
simple
people
especially
from
old
peasants
a
great
many
years
ago
i
had
a
case
which
concerned
a
disappearance
it
was
supposed
that
the
lost
man
was
murdered
various
examinations
were
made
without
result
until
finally
i
questioned
an
old
and
very
intelligent
peasant
who
had
known
well
the
lost
man
i
asked
the
witness
to
describe
the
nature
of
his
friend
very
accurately
in
order
that
i
might
draw
from
his
qualities
habits
my
inferences
concerning
his
tendencies
and
hence
concerning
his
possible
location
the
old
peasant
supposed
that
everything
had
been
said
about
the
man
in
question
when
he
explained
that
he
was
a
person
who
never
owned
a
decent
tool
this
was
an
excellent
description
the
value
of
which
i
completely
understood
only
when
the
murdered
man
came
to
life
and
i
learned
to
know
him
he
was
a
petty
lumberman
who
used
to
buy
small
wooded
tracts
in
the
high
mountains
for
cutting
and
having
cut
them
down
would
either
bring
the
wood
down
to
the
valley
or
have
it
turned
to
charcoal
in
the
fact
that
he
never
owned
a
decent
tool
nor
had
one
for
his
men
was
established
his
whole
narrow
point
of
view
his
cramped
miserliness
his
disgusting
prudence
his
constricted
kindliness
qualities
which
permitted
his
men
to
plague
themselves
uselessly
with
bad
tools
and
which
justified
altogether
his
lack
of
skill
in
the
purchase
of
tools
so
i
thought
how
the
few
words
of
the
old
peasant
were
confirmed
utterly
they
told
the
whole
story
such
men
indeed
who
say
little
but
say
it
effectively
must
be
carefully
attended
to
and
everything
must
be
done
to
develop
and
to
understand
what
they
mean
but
the
judge
requires
attention
and
appropriate
conservation
of
his
own
observations
whoever
observes
the
people
he
deals
with
soon
notices
that
there
is
probably
not
one
among
them
that
does
not
possess
some
similar
apparently
unessential
quality
like
that
mentioned
above
among
close
acquaintances
there
is
little
difficulty
in
establishing
which
of
their
characteristics
belong
to
that
quality
and
when
series
of
such
observations
are
brought
together
it
is
not
difficult
to
generalize
and
to
abstract
from
them
specific
rules
then
in
case
of
need
when
the
work
is
important
one
makes
use
of
the
appropriate
rule
with
pleasure
and
i
might
say
with
thanks
for
own
efforts
one
essential
and
often
useful
symbol
to
show
what
a
man
makes
of
himself
what
he
counts
himself
for
is
his
use
of
the
word
hartenstein
has
already
called
attention
to
the
importance
of
this
circumstance
and
volkmar
says
has
a
very
various
scope
from
the
point
of
an
accidental
simultaneity
of
images
in
the
same
sensation
representation
or
thought
to
the
almost
complete
circle
of
the
family
which
breaks
through
the
and
even
does
not
exclude
the
most
powerful
antagonisms
hatred
just
like
love
asserts
its
what
is
characteristic
in
the
word
is
the
opposition
of
a
larger
or
smaller
group
of
which
the
is
a
member
to
the
rest
of
the
universe
i
say
when
i
mean
merely
my
wife
and
myself
the
inhabitants
of
my
house
my
family
those
who
live
in
my
street
in
my
ward
or
in
my
city
i
say
assessors
we
we
austrians
we
germans
we
europeans
we
inhabitants
of
the
earth
i
say
we
lawyers
we
blonds
we
christians
we
mammals
we
collaborators
on
a
monthly
we
old
society
we
married
men
we
opponents
of
jury
trial
but
i
also
say
when
speaking
of
accidental
relations
such
as
being
on
the
same
train
meeting
on
the
same
mountain
peak
in
the
same
hotel
at
the
same
concert
etc
in
a
word
defines
all
relationships
from
the
narrowest
and
most
important
most
essential
to
the
most
individual
and
accidental
conceivably
the
we
unites
also
people
who
have
something
evil
in
common
who
use
it
a
great
deal
among
themselves
and
because
of
habit
in
places
where
they
would
rather
not
have
done
so
therefore
if
you
pay
attention
you
may
hear
some
suspect
who
denies
his
guilt
come
out
with
a
we
which
confesses
his
alliance
with
people
who
do
the
things
he
claims
not
to
pickpockets
gamblers
inverts
etc
it
is
so
conceivable
that
man
as
a
social
animal
seeks
companionship
in
so
many
directions
that
he
feels
better
protected
when
he
has
a
comrade
when
he
can
present
in
the
place
of
his
weak
and
unprotected
the
stronger
and
bolder
and
hence
the
considerable
and
varied
use
of
the
word
no
one
means
that
people
are
to
be
caught
with
the
word
it
is
merely
to
be
used
to
bring
clearness
into
our
work
like
every
other
honest
instrument
it
is
an
index
to
the
place
of
the
man
before
us
section
c
particular
it
is
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
it
is
enough
in
most
cases
to
study
that
side
of
a
man
which
is
at
the
moment
important
his
dishonesty
only
his
laziness
etc
that
will
naturally
lead
to
merely
judgment
and
anyway
be
much
harder
than
keeping
the
whole
man
in
eye
and
studying
him
as
an
entirety
every
individual
quality
is
merely
a
symptom
of
a
whole
nature
can
be
explained
only
by
the
whole
complex
and
the
good
properties
depend
as
much
on
the
bad
ones
as
the
bad
on
the
good
ones
at
the
very
least
the
quality
and
quantity
of
a
good
or
bad
characteristic
shows
the
influence
of
all
the
other
good
and
bad
characteristics
kindliness
is
influenced
and
partly
created
through
weakness
indetermination
too
great
susceptibility
a
minimum
acuteness
false
constructiveness
untrained
capacity
for
inference
in
the
same
way
again
the
most
cruel
hardness
depends
on
properties
which
taken
in
themselves
are
good
determination
energy
purposeful
action
clear
conception
of
fellows
healthy
egotism
etc
every
man
is
the
result
of
his
nature
and
nurture
of
countless
individual
conditions
and
every
one
of
his
expressions
again
is
the
result
of
all
of
these
conditions
if
therefore
he
is
to
be
judged
he
must
be
judged
in
the
light
of
them
all
for
this
reason
all
those
indications
that
show
us
the
man
as
a
whole
are
for
us
the
most
important
but
also
those
others
are
valuable
which
show
him
up
on
one
side
only
in
the
latter
case
however
they
are
to
be
considered
only
as
an
index
which
never
relieves
us
from
the
need
further
to
study
the
nature
of
our
subject
the
number
of
such
individual
indications
is
legion
and
no
one
is
able
to
count
them
up
and
ground
them
but
examples
of
them
may
be
indicated
we
ask
for
example
what
kind
of
man
will
give
us
the
best
and
most
reliable
information
about
the
conduct
and
activity
the
nature
and
character
of
an
individual
we
are
told
that
sort
of
person
who
is
usually
asked
for
the
information
his
nearest
friends
and
acquaintances
and
the
authorities
before
all
of
these
nobody
shows
himself
as
he
is
because
the
most
honest
man
will
show
himself
before
people
in
whose
judgment
he
has
an
interest
at
least
as
good
as
if
not
better
than
he
is
that
is
fundamental
to
the
general
egoistic
essence
of
humanity
which
seeks
at
least
to
avoid
reducing
its
present
welfare
authorities
who
are
asked
to
make
a
statement
concerning
any
person
can
say
reliably
only
how
often
the
man
was
punished
or
came
otherwise
in
contact
with
the
law
or
themselves
but
concerning
his
social
characteristics
the
authorities
have
nothing
to
say
they
have
got
to
investigate
them
and
the
detectives
have
to
bring
an
answer
then
the
detectives
are
at
most
simply
people
who
have
had
the
opportunity
to
watch
and
interrogate
the
individuals
in
question
the
servants
porters
etc
why
we
do
not
question
the
latter
ourselves
i
can
not
say
if
we
did
we
might
know
these
people
on
whom
we
depend
for
important
information
and
might
put
our
questions
according
to
the
answers
that
we
need
it
is
a
purely
negative
thing
that
an
official
declaration
is
nowadays
not
unfrequently
presented
to
us
in
the
disgusting
form
of
the
gossip
of
an
old
hag
but
in
itself
the
form
of
getting
information
about
people
through
servants
and
others
of
the
same
class
is
correct
one
has
however
to
beware
that
it
is
not
done
simply
because
the
gossips
are
most
easily
found
but
because
show
their
weaknesses
most
readily
before
those
whom
they
hold
of
no
the
latter
fact
is
well
known
but
not
sufficiently
studied
it
is
of
considerable
importance
let
us
then
examine
it
more
closely
nobody
is
ashamed
to
show
himself
before
an
animal
as
he
is
to
do
an
evil
thing
to
commit
a
crime
the
shame
will
increase
very
little
if
instead
of
the
animal
a
complete
idiot
is
present
and
if
now
we
suppose
the
intelligence
and
significance
of
this
witness
steadily
to
increase
the
shame
of
appearing
before
him
as
one
is
increases
in
a
like
degree
so
we
will
control
ourselves
most
before
people
whose
judgment
is
of
most
importance
to
us
the
styrian
peter
rosegger
one
of
the
best
students
of
mankind
once
told
a
story
of
how
the
most
ultimate
secrets
of
certain
people
became
common
talk
although
all
concerned
assured
him
that
nobody
had
succeeded
in
getting
knowledge
of
them
the
was
finally
discovered
in
the
person
of
an
old
humpy
quiet
woman
who
worked
by
the
day
in
various
homes
and
had
found
a
place
unobserved
and
apparently
indifferent
in
the
corner
of
the
nobody
had
told
her
any
secrets
but
things
were
allowed
to
occur
before
her
from
which
she
might
guess
and
put
them
together
nobody
had
watched
this
disinterested
ancient
lady
she
worked
like
a
machine
her
thoughts
when
she
noted
a
quarrel
or
anxiety
or
disagreement
or
joy
were
indifferent
to
all
concerned
and
so
she
discovered
a
great
deal
that
was
kept
secret
from
more
important
persons
this
simple
story
is
very
significant
we
are
not
to
pay
attention
to
gossips
but
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
information
of
persons
is
in
the
rule
more
important
and
more
reliable
when
the
question
under
consideration
is
indifferent
to
them
than
when
it
is
important
we
need
only
glance
at
our
own
situation
in
this
matter
what
do
we
know
about
our
servants
what
their
christian
names
are
because
we
have
to
call
them
where
they
come
from
because
we
hear
their
pronunciation
how
old
they
are
because
we
see
them
and
those
of
their
qualities
that
we
make
use
of
but
what
do
we
know
of
their
family
relationships
their
past
their
plans
their
joys
or
sorrows
the
lady
of
the
house
knows
perhaps
a
little
more
because
of
her
daily
intercourse
with
them
but
her
husband
learns
of
it
only
in
exceptional
cases
when
he
bothers
about
things
that
are
none
of
his
business
nor
does
madam
know
much
as
examination
shows
us
daily
but
what
on
the
other
hand
do
the
servants
know
about
us
the
relation
between
husband
and
wife
the
of
the
children
the
financial
situation
the
relation
with
cousins
the
the
especial
pleasures
each
joy
each
trouble
that
occurs
each
hope
everything
from
the
least
bodily
pain
to
the
very
simplest
secret
of
the
toilette
they
know
it
all
what
can
be
kept
from
them
the
most
restricted
of
them
are
aware
of
it
and
if
they
do
not
see
more
it
is
not
because
of
our
skill
at
hiding
but
because
of
their
stupidity
we
observe
that
in
these
cases
there
is
not
much
that
can
be
kept
secret
and
hence
do
not
trouble
to
do
so
there
is
besides
another
reason
for
allowing
subordinate
or
indifferent
people
to
see
weaknesses
the
reason
is
that
we
hate
those
who
are
witnesses
of
a
great
weakness
partly
it
is
shame
partly
vexation
at
oneself
partly
pure
egoism
but
it
is
a
fact
that
anger
turns
instinctively
upon
those
who
have
observed
degradation
through
own
weakness
this
is
so
frequently
the
case
that
the
witness
is
to
be
the
more
relied
on
the
more
the
accused
would
seem
to
have
preferred
that
the
witness
had
not
seen
him
insignificant
people
are
not
taken
as
real
witnesses
they
were
there
but
they
perceived
anything
and
by
the
time
it
comes
to
light
that
they
see
at
least
as
well
as
anybody
else
it
is
too
late
one
will
not
go
far
wrong
in
explaining
the
situation
with
the
much
varied
epigram
of
tacitus
odit
it
is
at
least
through
that
one
porter
hates
another
and
the
reason
for
it
lies
in
the
fact
that
two
of
a
trade
know
each
weaknesses
that
one
always
knows
how
the
other
tries
to
hide
his
lack
of
knowledge
how
deceitful
fundamentally
every
human
activity
is
and
how
much
trouble
everybody
takes
to
make
his
own
trade
appear
to
the
other
as
fine
as
possible
if
you
know
however
that
your
neighbor
is
as
wise
as
you
are
the
latter
becomes
a
troublesome
witness
in
any
disagreeable
matter
and
if
he
is
often
thought
of
in
this
way
he
comes
to
be
hated
hence
you
must
never
be
more
cautious
than
when
one
gives
evidence
about
another
esprit
de
corps
and
jealousy
pull
the
truth
with
frightful
force
this
way
and
that
and
the
picture
becomes
the
more
distorted
because
esprit
de
corps
is
nothing
more
than
generalized
selfishness
kant
is
not
saying
enough
when
he
says
that
the
egoist
is
a
person
who
always
tries
to
push
his
own
forward
and
to
make
it
the
chief
object
of
his
own
and
of
everybody
attention
for
the
person
who
merely
seeks
attention
is
only
conceited
the
egoist
however
seeks
his
own
advantage
alone
even
at
the
cost
of
other
people
and
when
he
shows
esprit
de
corps
he
desires
the
advantage
of
his
corps
because
he
also
has
a
share
in
that
in
this
sense
one
of
a
trade
has
much
to
say
about
his
fellow
craftsmen
but
because
of
jealousy
says
too
little
in
what
direction
however
he
is
most
likely
to
turn
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
case
and
the
character
of
the
witness
in
most
instances
it
will
be
possible
to
make
certain
distinctions
as
to
when
objectively
too
much
and
subjectively
too
little
is
said
that
is
to
say
the
craftsman
will
exaggerate
with
regard
to
all
general
questions
but
with
regard
to
his
special
fellow
jealousy
will
establish
her
rights
an
absolute
distinction
may
never
be
drawn
not
even
subjectively
suppose
that
a
has
something
to
say
about
his
fellow
craftsman
b
and
suppose
that
certain
achievements
of
b
are
to
be
valued
if
now
a
has
been
working
in
the
same
field
as
b
he
must
not
depreciate
too
much
the
value
of
work
since
otherwise
his
own
work
is
in
danger
of
the
same
low
valuation
objectively
the
converse
is
true
for
if
a
bulls
the
general
efficiency
of
his
trade
it
serve
his
conceit
since
we
find
simply
that
the
competitor
is
in
this
way
given
too
high
a
value
it
would
be
inadvisable
to
give
particular
examples
from
special
trades
but
everybody
who
has
before
him
one
after
another
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
professions
and
who
considers
the
statements
they
make
about
each
other
will
grant
the
correctness
of
our
contention
i
do
not
at
this
point
either
assert
that
the
matter
is
the
same
in
each
and
every
case
but
that
it
is
generally
so
is
indubitable
there
is
still
another
thing
to
be
observed
a
good
many
people
who
are
especially
efficient
in
their
trades
desire
to
be
known
as
especially
efficient
in
some
other
and
remote
circle
it
is
historic
that
a
certain
regent
was
happy
when
his
very
modest
was
praised
a
poet
was
pleased
when
his
miserable
drawings
were
admired
a
marshal
wanted
to
hear
no
praise
of
his
victories
but
much
of
his
very
doubtful
declamation
the
case
is
the
same
among
lesser
men
a
craftsman
wants
to
shine
with
some
foolishness
in
another
craft
and
philistine
is
happiest
when
he
is
considered
a
devil
of
a
the
importance
of
this
fact
lies
in
the
possibility
of
error
in
conclusions
drawn
from
what
the
subject
himself
tries
to
present
about
his
knowledge
and
power
with
regard
to
the
past
it
leads
even
fundamentally
honest
persons
to
deception
and
lying
so
for
example
a
student
who
might
have
been
the
most
solid
and
harmless
in
his
class
later
makes
suggestions
that
he
was
the
wildest
sport
the
artist
who
tried
to
make
his
way
during
his
cubhood
most
bravely
with
the
money
of
his
mother
is
glad
to
have
it
known
that
he
was
guilty
as
a
young
man
of
unmitigated
nonsense
and
the
ancient
dame
who
was
once
the
most
modest
of
girls
is
tickled
with
the
flattery
of
a
story
concerning
her
magnificent
flirtations
when
such
a
matter
is
important
for
us
it
must
be
received
with
great
caution
to
this
class
of
people
who
want
to
appear
rather
more
interesting
than
they
are
either
in
their
past
or
present
belong
also
those
who
declare
that
everything
is
possible
and
who
have
led
many
a
judge
into
vexatious
mistakes
this
happens
especially
when
an
accused
person
tries
to
explain
away
the
suspicions
against
him
by
daring
statements
concerning
his
great
achievements
in
going
back
to
a
certain
place
or
his
feats
of
strength
etc
and
when
witnesses
are
asked
if
these
are
conceivable
one
gets
the
impression
in
these
cases
that
the
witnesses
under
consideration
suppose
that
they
belittle
themselves
and
their
point
of
view
if
they
think
anything
to
be
impossible
they
are
easily
recognized
they
belong
to
the
worst
class
of
promoters
and
inventors
or
their
relations
if
a
man
is
studying
how
to
pay
the
national
debt
or
to
solve
the
social
question
or
to
irrigate
sahara
or
is
inclined
to
discover
a
dirigible
a
machine
or
a
panacea
or
if
he
shows
sympathy
for
people
so
inclined
he
is
likely
to
consider
everything
possible
and
men
of
this
sort
are
surprisingly
numerous
they
do
not
as
a
rule
carry
their
plans
about
in
public
and
hence
have
the
status
of
prudent
persons
but
they
betray
themselves
by
their
propensity
for
the
impossible
in
all
conceivable
directions
if
a
man
is
suspected
to
be
one
of
them
and
the
matter
is
important
enough
he
may
be
brought
during
the
conversation
to
talk
about
some
project
or
invention
he
will
then
show
how
his
class
begins
to
deal
with
it
with
what
i
might
call
a
suspicious
warmth
by
that
token
you
know
the
class
they
belong
to
that
large
group
of
people
who
without
being
abnormal
still
have
passed
the
line
which
divides
the
perfectly
trustworthy
from
those
unreliable
persons
who
with
the
best
inclination
to
tell
the
truth
can
render
it
only
as
it
is
distorted
by
their
clouded
minds
these
people
are
not
to
be
confused
with
those
specific
men
of
power
who
in
the
attempt
to
show
what
they
can
do
go
further
than
in
truth
they
should
there
are
indeed
persons
of
talent
who
are
efficient
and
know
it
whether
for
good
or
evil
and
they
happen
to
belong
both
to
the
class
of
the
accused
and
of
the
witness
the
former
show
this
quality
in
confessing
to
more
than
they
are
guilty
of
or
tell
their
story
in
such
a
way
as
to
more
clearly
demonstrate
both
their
power
and
their
conceit
so
that
it
may
happen
that
a
man
takes
upon
himself
a
crime
that
he
shares
with
three
accomplices
or
that
he
describes
a
simple
larceny
as
one
in
which
force
had
to
be
used
with
regard
to
its
object
and
even
with
regard
to
the
owner
or
perhaps
he
describes
his
flight
or
his
as
much
more
troublesome
than
these
actually
were
or
need
have
been
the
witness
behaves
in
a
similar
fashion
and
shows
his
defense
against
an
attack
for
example
or
his
skill
in
discovery
of
his
goods
or
his
detection
of
the
criminal
in
a
much
brighter
light
than
really
belongs
to
it
he
even
may
describe
situations
that
were
superfluous
in
order
to
show
what
he
can
do
in
this
way
the
simplest
fact
is
often
distorted
as
suspects
such
people
are
particularly
difficult
to
deal
with
aside
from
the
fact
that
they
do
more
and
actually
have
done
more
than
was
necessary
they
become
unmanageable
and
through
unjust
accusations
concerning
these
people
the
statement
made
a
hundred
years
ago
by
ben
david
still
holds
turns
wise
people
raw
and
foolish
and
kindly
and
well
disposed
ones
cruel
and
there
are
often
well
disposed
natures
who
after
troubles
express
themselves
in
the
manner
described
it
very
frequently
happens
that
suspects
especially
those
under
arrest
alter
completely
in
the
course
of
time
become
sullen
coarse
passionate
show
themselves
defiant
and
resentful
to
even
the
approach
and
exhibit
even
a
kind
of
courage
in
not
offering
any
defense
and
in
keeping
silent
such
phenomena
require
the
most
obvious
caution
for
one
is
now
dealing
apparently
with
powerful
fellows
who
have
received
injustice
whether
they
are
quite
guiltless
whether
they
are
being
improperly
dealt
with
or
for
whatever
reason
the
proper
approach
has
not
been
made
we
must
go
back
to
proceed
in
another
fashion
and
absolutely
keep
in
mind
the
possibility
of
their
being
innocent
in
spite
of
serious
evidence
against
them
these
people
are
mainly
recognizable
by
their
mode
of
life
their
habitual
appearance
and
its
expression
once
that
is
known
their
conduct
in
court
is
known
in
the
matter
of
individual
features
of
character
the
form
of
life
the
way
of
doing
things
is
especially
to
be
observed
many
an
effort
many
a
quality
can
be
explained
in
no
other
way
the
simple
declaration
of
volkmar
are
some
things
that
we
want
only
because
we
had
them
once
explains
to
the
criminalist
long
series
of
phenomena
that
might
otherwise
have
remained
unintelligible
many
a
larceny
robbery
possibly
murder
many
a
crime
springing
from
jealousy
many
sexual
offenses
become
intelligible
when
one
learns
that
the
criminal
had
at
one
time
possessed
the
object
for
the
sake
of
which
he
committed
the
crime
and
having
lost
it
had
tried
with
irresistible
vigor
to
regain
it
what
is
extraordinary
in
the
matter
is
the
fact
that
considerable
time
passes
between
the
loss
and
the
desire
for
recovery
it
seems
as
if
the
isolated
moments
of
desire
sum
themselves
up
in
the
course
of
time
and
then
break
out
as
the
crime
in
such
cases
the
explaining
motive
of
the
deed
is
never
to
be
found
except
in
the
past
the
same
relationship
exists
in
the
cases
of
countless
criminals
whose
crimes
seem
at
bottom
due
to
apparently
inconceivable
brutality
in
all
such
cases
especially
when
the
facts
do
not
otherwise
make
apparent
the
possible
guilt
of
the
suspect
the
story
of
the
development
has
to
be
studied
gustav
struve
asserts
that
it
is
demonstrable
that
young
men
become
surgeons
out
of
pure
cruelty
out
of
desire
to
see
people
suffer
pain
and
to
cause
pain
a
student
of
pharmacy
became
a
hangman
for
the
same
reason
and
a
rich
dutchman
paid
the
butchers
for
allowing
him
to
kill
oxen
if
then
one
is
dealing
with
a
crime
which
points
to
cruelty
how
can
one
be
certain
about
its
motive
and
history
without
knowing
the
history
of
the
criminal
this
is
the
more
necessary
inasmuch
as
we
may
be
easily
deceived
through
apparent
motives
as
in
most
capital
crimes
two
or
more
motives
work
together
an
ostensible
and
a
concealed
one
says
kraus
criminal
has
at
his
command
apparent
motives
which
encourage
the
we
know
well
enough
how
frequently
the
thief
excuses
himself
on
the
ground
of
his
need
how
the
criminal
wants
to
appear
as
merely
acting
in
during
robberies
and
how
often
the
sensualist
even
when
he
has
misbehaved
with
a
little
child
still
asserts
that
the
child
had
seduced
him
in
murder
cases
even
when
the
murderer
has
confessed
we
frequently
find
that
he
tries
to
excuse
himself
the
woman
who
poisons
her
husband
really
because
she
wants
to
marry
another
tells
her
story
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
it
appear
that
she
killed
him
because
he
was
extraordinarily
bad
and
that
her
deed
simply
freed
the
world
of
a
disgusting
object
as
a
rule
the
psychological
aspect
of
such
cases
is
made
more
difficult
by
the
reason
that
the
subject
has
in
a
greater
or
lesser
degree
convinced
himself
of
the
truth
of
his
statements
and
finally
believes
his
reasons
for
excuse
altogether
or
in
part
and
if
a
man
believes
what
he
says
the
proof
that
the
story
is
false
is
much
harder
to
make
because
psychological
arguments
that
might
be
used
to
prove
falsehood
are
then
of
no
use
this
is
an
important
fact
which
compels
us
to
draw
a
sharp
line
between
a
person
who
is
obviously
lying
and
one
who
does
believe
what
he
says
we
have
to
discover
the
difference
inasmuch
as
the
conviction
of
the
truth
of
a
story
is
never
so
deep
rooted
as
the
real
conviction
of
truth
for
that
reason
the
person
who
has
convinced
himself
of
his
truth
artificially
watches
all
doubts
and
objections
with
much
greater
care
than
a
man
who
has
no
doubt
whatever
in
what
he
says
the
former
moreover
does
not
have
a
good
conscience
and
the
proverb
says
truly
bad
conscience
has
a
fine
the
man
knows
that
he
is
not
dealing
correctly
with
the
thing
and
hence
he
observes
all
objections
and
the
fact
that
he
does
so
observe
can
not
be
easily
overlooked
by
the
examining
officer
once
this
fine
hearing
distinguishes
the
individual
who
really
believes
in
the
motive
he
plausibly
offers
the
court
there
is
another
indication
obviously
quite
apart
from
the
general
signs
of
deceit
that
marks
him
further
and
this
comes
to
light
when
one
has
him
speak
about
similar
crimes
of
others
in
which
the
ostensible
motive
actually
was
present
it
is
said
rightly
that
not
he
is
old
who
no
longer
commits
youthful
follies
but
he
that
no
longer
forgives
them
and
so
not
merely
he
is
bad
who
himself
commits
evil
but
also
he
who
excuses
them
in
others
of
course
that
an
accused
person
should
defend
the
naked
deed
as
it
is
described
in
the
criminal
law
is
not
likely
for
conceivable
reasons
since
certainly
no
will
sing
a
paean
about
robbers
but
certainly
almost
anybody
who
has
a
better
or
a
motive
for
his
crime
will
protect
those
who
have
been
guided
by
a
similar
motive
in
other
cases
every
experiment
shows
this
to
be
the
case
and
then
apparent
motives
are
easily
enough
recognized
as
such
d
somatic
section
when
we
say
that
the
inner
condition
of
men
implies
some
outer
expression
it
must
follow
that
there
are
series
of
phenomena
which
especially
mold
the
body
in
terms
of
the
influence
of
a
state
of
mind
on
external
appearance
or
conversely
which
are
significant
of
the
influence
of
some
physical
uniqueness
on
the
psychical
state
or
of
some
other
psycho
physical
condition
as
an
example
of
the
first
kind
one
may
cite
the
well
known
phenomenon
that
devotees
always
make
an
impression
rather
specifically
feminine
as
an
example
of
the
second
kind
is
the
fact
demonstrated
by
gyurkovechky
that
impotents
exhibit
disagreeable
characteristics
such
conditions
find
their
universalizing
expression
in
the
cruel
but
true
maxim
of
the
marked
the
bible
was
the
first
of
all
to
make
mention
of
these
evil
stigmata
no
one
of
course
asserts
that
the
bearer
of
any
bodily
malformation
is
for
that
reason
invested
with
one
or
more
evil
qualities
cum
hoc
sed
propter
it
is
a
general
quality
of
the
untrained
and
hence
the
majority
of
men
that
they
shall
greet
the
unfortunate
who
suffers
from
some
bodily
malformation
not
with
care
and
protection
but
with
scorn
and
maltreatment
such
propensities
belong
alas
not
only
to
adults
but
also
to
children
who
annoy
their
deformed
playfellows
whether
expressly
or
whether
because
they
are
inconsiderate
and
continually
call
the
unhappy
attention
to
his
deformity
hence
there
follows
in
most
cases
from
earliest
youth
at
first
a
certain
bitterness
then
envy
unkindness
stifled
rage
against
the
fortunate
joy
in
destruction
and
all
the
other
hateful
similar
qualities
however
they
may
be
named
in
the
course
of
time
all
of
these
retained
bitter
impressions
summate
and
the
qualities
arising
from
them
become
more
acute
become
habitual
and
at
last
you
have
a
person
for
add
to
this
the
indubitable
fact
that
the
marked
persons
are
considerably
wiser
and
than
the
others
whether
this
is
so
by
accident
or
is
causally
established
is
difficult
to
say
but
inasmuch
as
most
of
them
are
compelled
just
by
their
deformities
to
deprive
themselves
of
all
common
pleasures
and
to
concern
themselves
with
their
own
affairs
once
they
have
been
fed
to
satiety
with
abuse
scorn
and
heckling
the
latter
is
the
more
likely
under
such
circumstances
they
have
to
think
more
they
learn
more
than
the
others
to
train
their
wits
largely
as
means
of
defense
against
physical
attack
they
often
succeed
by
wit
but
then
they
can
never
be
brought
into
a
state
of
good
temper
and
lovableness
when
they
are
required
to
defend
themselves
by
means
of
sharp
biting
and
destructive
wit
moreover
if
the
deformed
is
naturally
not
other
dormant
evil
tendencies
develop
in
him
which
might
never
have
realized
themselves
if
he
had
had
no
need
of
them
for
purposes
of
lying
slander
intrigue
persecution
by
means
of
unpermitted
instruments
etc
all
this
finally
forms
a
determinate
complex
of
phenomena
which
is
undivorceably
bound
in
the
eyes
of
the
expert
with
every
species
of
deformity
the
mistrusting
of
the
deaf
man
the
menacing
expression
of
the
blind
the
indescribable
and
therefore
extremely
characteristic
smiling
of
the
are
not
the
only
typical
phenomena
of
this
kind
all
this
is
popularly
known
and
is
abnormally
believed
in
so
that
we
often
discover
that
the
deformed
are
more
frequently
suspected
of
crime
than
normal
people
suspicion
turns
to
them
especially
when
an
unknown
criminal
has
committed
a
crime
the
accomplishment
of
which
required
a
particularly
evil
nature
and
where
the
deed
of
itself
called
forth
general
indignation
in
that
case
once
a
deformed
person
is
suspected
grounds
of
suspicion
are
not
difficult
to
find
a
few
collect
more
as
a
rolling
ball
does
snow
after
that
the
sweet
proverb
populi
vox
dei
drives
the
unfortunate
fellow
into
a
chaos
of
evidential
grounds
of
suspicion
which
may
all
be
reduced
to
the
fact
that
he
has
red
hair
or
a
hump
such
events
are
frightfully
frequent
section
of
just
as
important
as
these
phenomena
are
the
somatic
results
of
psychic
irritation
these
latter
clear
up
processes
not
to
be
explained
by
words
alone
and
often
and
falsely
interpreted
irritations
are
important
for
two
reasons
as
causes
of
crime
and
as
signs
of
identification
in
examination
in
regard
to
the
first
it
is
not
necessary
to
show
what
crimes
are
committed
because
of
anger
jealousy
or
rage
and
how
frequently
terror
and
fear
lead
to
extremes
otherwise
inexplicable
these
facts
are
partly
so
well
known
partly
so
very
numerous
and
various
that
an
exposition
would
be
either
superfluous
or
impossible
only
those
phenomena
will
be
indicated
which
lie
to
some
degree
on
the
borderland
of
the
observed
and
hence
may
be
overlooked
to
this
class
belong
for
example
anger
against
the
object
which
serves
as
explanation
of
a
group
of
malicious
damages
such
as
arson
etc
everybody
even
though
not
particularly
lively
remembers
instances
in
which
he
fell
into
great
and
inexplicable
rage
against
an
object
when
the
latter
set
in
his
way
some
special
difficulties
or
caused
him
pain
and
he
remembers
how
he
created
considerable
ease
for
himself
by
flinging
it
aside
tearing
it
or
smashing
it
to
pieces
when
i
was
a
student
i
owned
a
very
old
thick
latin
lexicon
cornu
copia
bound
in
wood
covered
with
this
respectable
book
flew
to
the
ground
whenever
its
master
was
vexed
and
never
failed
profoundly
to
reduce
the
inner
stress
this
was
inherited
from
my
and
it
did
not
suffer
much
damage
when
however
some
poor
apprentice
tears
the
fence
on
a
nail
of
which
his
only
coat
got
a
bad
tear
or
when
a
young
peasant
kills
the
dog
that
barks
at
him
menacingly
and
tries
to
get
at
his
calf
then
we
come
along
with
our
according
to
so
and
so
much
and
the
fellow
done
any
more
than
i
have
with
my
in
the
magnificent
novel
einer
by
vischer
there
is
an
excellent
portrait
of
the
perversity
of
things
the
author
asserts
that
things
rather
frequently
hold
ecumenical
councils
with
the
devil
for
the
molestation
of
mankind
how
far
the
perversity
of
the
inanimate
can
lead
i
saw
in
a
criminal
case
in
which
a
big
isolated
was
set
on
fire
a
traveler
was
going
across
the
country
and
sought
shelter
against
oncoming
bad
weather
the
very
last
minute
before
a
heavy
shower
he
reached
a
with
a
solid
straw
cover
crept
into
it
made
himself
comfortable
in
the
hay
and
enjoyed
his
good
fortune
then
he
fell
asleep
but
soon
woke
again
inasmuch
as
he
his
clothes
and
all
the
hay
around
him
was
thoroughly
soaked
for
the
roof
just
above
him
was
leaking
in
frightful
rage
over
this
perversity
he
set
the
stack
on
fire
and
it
burned
to
the
ground
it
may
be
said
that
the
fact
of
the
anger
is
as
much
a
motive
as
any
other
and
should
have
no
influence
on
the
legal
side
of
the
incident
though
this
is
quite
true
we
are
bound
to
consider
the
crime
and
the
criminal
as
a
unit
and
to
judge
them
so
if
under
such
circumstances
we
can
say
that
this
unit
is
an
outcome
natural
to
the
character
of
mankind
and
even
if
we
say
perhaps
that
we
might
have
behaved
similarly
under
like
circumstances
if
we
really
can
not
find
something
absolutely
evil
in
the
deed
the
criminal
quality
of
it
is
throughout
reduced
also
in
such
smaller
cases
the
fundamental
concept
of
modern
criminology
comes
clearly
into
the
foreground
the
crime
but
the
criminal
is
the
object
of
punishment
not
the
concept
but
the
man
is
liszt
the
fact
of
the
presence
of
a
significant
irritation
is
important
for
passing
judgment
and
renders
it
necessary
to
observe
with
the
most
thorough
certainty
how
this
irritation
comes
about
this
is
the
more
important
inasmuch
as
it
becomes
possible
to
decide
whether
the
irritation
is
real
or
artificial
and
imitated
otherwise
however
the
meaning
of
the
irritation
can
be
properly
valued
only
when
its
development
can
be
held
together
step
by
step
with
its
causes
suppose
i
let
the
suspect
know
the
reason
of
suspicion
brought
by
his
enemies
then
if
his
anger
sensibly
increases
with
the
presentation
of
each
new
ground
it
appears
much
more
natural
and
real
than
if
the
anger
increased
in
inexplicable
fashion
with
regard
to
less
important
reasons
for
suspicion
and
developed
more
slowly
with
regard
to
the
more
important
ones
the
collective
nature
of
somatic
phenomena
in
the
case
of
great
excitement
has
been
much
studied
especially
among
animals
these
being
simpler
and
less
artificial
and
therefore
easier
to
understand
and
in
the
long
run
comparatively
like
men
in
the
expression
of
their
emotions
very
many
animals
according
to
darwin
erect
their
hair
or
feathers
or
quills
in
cases
of
anxiety
fear
or
horror
and
nowadays
indeed
involuntarily
in
order
to
exhibit
themselves
as
larger
and
more
terrible
the
same
rising
of
the
hair
even
plays
a
greater
role
among
men
than
is
generally
supposed
everybody
has
either
seen
in
others
or
discovered
in
himself
that
fear
and
terror
visibly
raise
the
hair
i
saw
it
with
especial
clearness
during
an
examination
when
the
person
under
arrest
suddenly
perceived
with
clearness
though
he
was
otherwise
altogether
innocent
in
what
great
danger
he
stood
of
being
taken
for
the
real
criminal
that
our
hair
rises
in
cases
of
fear
and
horror
without
being
visible
is
shown
i
believe
in
the
well
known
movement
of
the
hand
from
forehead
to
crown
it
may
be
supposed
that
the
hair
rises
at
the
roots
invisibly
but
sensibly
and
thus
causes
a
mild
tickling
and
pricking
of
the
scalp
which
is
reduced
by
smoothing
the
head
with
the
hand
this
movement
then
is
a
form
of
involuntary
scratching
to
remove
irritation
that
such
a
characteristic
movement
is
made
during
examination
may
therefore
be
very
significant
under
certain
circumstances
inasmuch
as
the
process
is
indubitably
an
influence
of
the
nerves
upon
the
finer
and
thinner
it
must
have
a
certain
resemblance
to
the
process
by
which
as
a
consequence
of
fear
horror
anxiety
or
care
the
hair
more
or
less
suddenly
turns
white
such
occurrences
are
in
comparatively
large
numbers
historical
pouchet
counts
up
cases
in
which
hair
turned
white
suddenly
among
them
one
where
it
happened
while
the
poor
sinner
was
being
led
to
execution
such
cases
do
not
interest
us
because
even
if
the
accused
himself
turned
grey
over
night
no
evidence
is
afforded
of
guilt
or
innocence
such
an
occurrence
can
be
evidential
only
when
the
hair
changes
color
demonstrably
in
the
case
of
a
witness
it
may
then
be
certainly
believed
that
he
had
experienced
something
terrible
and
aging
but
whether
he
had
really
experienced
this
or
merely
believed
that
he
had
experienced
it
can
as
yet
not
be
discovered
since
the
belief
and
the
actual
event
have
the
same
mental
and
physical
result
properly
to
understand
the
other
phenomena
that
are
the
result
of
significant
irritation
their
matrix
their
aboriginal
source
must
be
studied
spencer
says
that
fear
expresses
itself
in
cries
in
hiding
sobbing
and
trembling
all
of
which
accompany
the
discovery
of
the
really
terrible
while
the
destructive
passions
manifest
themselves
in
tension
of
the
muscles
gritting
of
the
teeth
extending
the
claws
all
weaker
forms
of
the
activity
of
killing
all
this
aboriginally
inherited
from
the
animals
occurs
in
rather
less
intense
degrees
in
man
inclusive
of
baring
the
claws
for
exactly
this
movement
may
often
be
noticed
when
somebody
is
speaking
with
anger
and
vexation
about
another
person
and
at
the
same
time
extends
and
contracts
his
fingers
anybody
who
does
this
even
mildly
and
unnoticeably
means
harm
to
the
person
he
is
talking
about
darwin
indeed
in
his
acutely
observing
fashion
has
also
called
attention
to
this
he
suggests
that
a
man
may
hate
another
intensely
but
that
so
long
as
his
anatomy
is
not
affected
he
may
not
be
said
to
be
enraged
this
means
clearly
that
the
somatic
manifestations
of
inner
excitement
are
so
closely
bound
up
with
the
latter
that
we
require
the
former
whenever
we
want
to
say
anything
about
the
latter
and
it
is
true
that
we
never
say
that
a
man
was
enraged
or
only
angry
if
he
remained
physically
calm
no
matter
how
noisy
and
explicit
he
might
have
been
with
words
this
is
evidence
enough
of
the
importance
of
noticing
bodily
expression
characteristic
says
volkmar
the
trembling
and
heavy
breathing
of
fear
the
glowering
glance
of
anger
the
choking
down
of
suppressed
vexation
the
stifling
of
helpless
rage
the
leering
glance
and
jumping
heart
of
darwin
completes
the
description
of
fear
the
heart
beats
fast
the
features
pale
he
feels
cold
but
sweats
the
hair
rises
the
secretion
of
saliva
stops
hence
follows
frequent
swallowing
the
voice
becomes
hoarse
yawning
begins
the
nostrils
tremble
the
pupils
widen
the
constrictor
muscles
relax
wild
and
very
primitive
people
show
this
much
more
clearly
and
tremble
quite
uncontrolled
the
last
may
often
be
seen
and
may
indeed
be
established
as
a
standard
of
culture
and
even
of
character
and
may
help
to
determine
how
far
a
man
may
prevent
the
inner
irritation
from
becoming
externally
noticeable
especially
he
who
has
much
to
do
with
gypsies
is
aware
how
little
these
people
can
control
themselves
from
this
fact
also
spring
the
numerous
anecdotes
concerning
the
wild
rulers
of
uncultivated
people
who
simply
read
the
guilt
of
the
suspect
from
his
external
behavior
or
even
more
frequently
were
able
to
select
the
criminal
with
undeceivable
acuteness
from
a
number
brought
before
them
bain
narrates
that
in
india
criminals
are
required
to
take
rice
in
the
mouth
and
after
awhile
to
spit
it
out
if
it
is
dry
the
accused
is
held
to
be
guilty
fear
has
stopped
the
secretion
of
saliva
obstupui
stetetuntque
comae
et
vox
faucibus
haesit
concerning
the
characteristic
influence
of
timidity
see
paul
hartenberg
especially
are
the
outbreaks
of
anger
against
oneself
the
more
so
because
i
believe
them
always
to
be
evidence
of
consciousness
of
guilt
at
least
i
have
never
yet
seen
an
innocent
man
fall
into
a
paroxysm
of
rage
against
himself
nor
have
i
ever
heard
that
others
have
observed
it
and
i
would
not
be
able
psychologically
to
explain
such
a
thing
should
it
happen
inasmuch
as
scenes
of
this
kind
can
occur
perceivably
only
in
the
most
externalized
forms
of
anger
so
such
an
explosion
is
elementary
and
can
not
possibly
be
confused
with
another
if
a
man
wrings
his
hands
until
they
bleed
or
digs
his
into
his
forehead
nobody
will
say
that
this
is
anger
against
himself
it
is
only
an
attempt
to
do
something
to
release
energy
to
bring
it
to
bear
against
somebody
people
are
visibly
angry
against
themselves
only
when
they
do
such
things
to
themselves
as
they
might
do
to
other
people
for
example
beating
smashing
pulling
the
hair
etc
this
is
particularly
frequent
among
orientals
who
are
more
emotional
than
europeans
so
i
saw
a
gypsy
run
his
head
against
a
wall
and
a
jew
throw
himself
on
his
knees
extend
his
arms
and
box
his
ears
with
both
hands
so
forcibly
that
the
next
day
his
cheeks
were
swollen
but
other
races
if
only
they
are
passionate
enough
behave
in
a
similar
manner
i
saw
a
woman
for
example
tear
whole
handfuls
of
hair
from
her
head
a
murdering
thief
guilty
of
more
or
fewer
crimes
smash
his
head
on
the
corner
of
a
window
and
a
seventeen
year
old
murderer
throw
himself
into
a
ditch
in
the
street
beat
his
head
fiercely
on
the
earth
and
yell
me
pull
my
head
off
the
events
in
all
these
cases
were
significantly
similar
the
crime
was
so
skilfully
committed
as
conceivably
to
prevent
the
discovery
of
the
criminal
the
criminal
denied
the
deed
with
the
most
glaring
impudence
and
fought
with
all
his
power
against
conviction
in
the
moment
however
he
realized
that
all
was
lost
he
exerted
his
boundless
rage
against
himself
who
had
been
unable
to
oppose
any
obstacle
to
conviction
and
who
had
not
been
cautious
and
sly
enough
in
the
commission
of
the
crime
hence
the
development
of
the
fearful
which
could
have
no
meaning
if
the
victim
had
felt
innocent
such
expressions
of
anger
against
oneself
often
finish
with
fainting
the
reason
of
the
latter
is
much
less
exhaustion
through
paroxysms
of
rage
than
the
recognition
and
consciousness
of
own
helplessness
reichenbach
once
examined
the
reason
for
the
fainting
of
people
in
difficult
situations
it
is
nowadays
explained
as
the
effect
of
the
excretion
of
carbonic
acid
gas
and
of
the
generated
anthropotoxin
another
explanation
makes
it
a
nervous
phenomenon
in
which
the
mere
recognition
that
release
is
impossible
causes
fainting
the
loss
of
consciousness
for
our
needs
either
account
of
this
phenomenon
will
do
equally
it
is
indifferent
whether
a
man
notices
that
he
can
not
voluntarily
change
his
condition
in
a
physical
sense
or
whether
he
notices
that
the
evidence
is
so
convincing
that
he
can
not
dodge
it
the
point
is
that
if
for
one
reason
or
another
he
finds
himself
physically
or
legally
in
a
bad
hole
he
faints
just
as
people
in
novels
or
on
the
stage
faint
when
there
is
no
other
solution
of
the
dramatic
situation
when
anger
does
not
lead
to
rage
against
oneself
the
next
lower
stage
is
laughter
with
regard
to
this
point
darwin
calls
attention
to
the
fact
that
laughter
often
conceals
other
mental
conditions
than
those
it
essentially
stands
for
anger
rage
pain
perplexity
modesty
and
shame
when
it
conceals
anger
it
is
anger
against
oneself
a
form
of
scorn
this
same
wooden
dry
laughter
is
significant
and
when
it
arises
from
the
perception
that
the
accused
no
longer
sees
his
way
out
it
is
not
easily
to
be
confused
with
another
form
of
laughter
one
gets
the
impression
that
the
laughter
is
trying
to
tell
himself
is
what
you
get
for
being
bad
and
foolish
section
under
this
caption
must
be
placed
certain
conditions
that
may
under
given
circumstances
be
important
although
apparently
without
any
relations
to
each
other
they
have
the
common
property
of
being
external
manifestations
of
mental
processes
in
many
cases
they
are
explanations
which
may
arise
from
the
observation
of
the
mutative
relations
between
cruelty
bloodthirstiness
and
sensuality
with
regard
to
this
older
authors
like
mitchell
blumr√∂der
friedreich
have
brought
examples
which
are
still
of
no
little
worth
they
speak
of
cases
in
which
many
people
not
alone
men
use
the
irritation
developed
by
greater
or
lesser
cruelty
for
sexual
purposes
the
torturing
of
animals
biting
pinching
choking
the
partner
etc
nowadays
this
is
called
sadism
certain
girls
narrate
their
fear
of
some
of
their
visitors
who
make
them
suffer
unendurably
especially
at
the
point
of
extreme
passion
by
biting
pressing
and
choking
this
fact
may
have
some
value
in
criminology
on
the
one
hand
certain
crimes
can
be
explained
only
by
means
of
sexual
cruelty
and
on
the
other
knowledge
of
his
habits
with
this
regard
may
again
help
toward
the
conviction
of
a
criminal
i
recall
only
the
case
of
in
vienna
a
case
in
which
a
prostitute
was
stifled
the
police
were
at
that
time
hunting
a
man
who
was
known
in
the
quarter
as
because
he
would
always
bring
with
him
two
fowls
which
he
would
choke
during
the
orgasm
it
was
rightly
inferred
that
a
man
who
did
that
sort
of
thing
was
capable
under
similar
circumstances
of
killing
a
human
being
therefore
it
will
be
well
in
the
examination
of
a
person
accused
of
a
cruel
crime
not
to
neglect
the
question
of
his
sexual
habits
or
better
still
to
be
sure
to
inquire
particularly
whether
the
whole
situation
of
the
crime
was
not
sexual
in
nature
in
this
connection
deeds
that
lead
to
cruelty
and
murder
often
involve
forms
of
epilepsy
it
ought
therefore
always
to
be
a
practice
to
consult
a
physician
concerning
the
accused
for
cruelty
lust
and
psychic
disorders
are
often
enough
closely
related
about
this
matter
lombroso
is
famous
for
the
wealth
of
material
he
presents
section
the
question
of
is
of
essential
significance
and
must
not
be
undervalued
it
has
been
much
studied
and
the
notion
has
been
reached
that
children
mainly
in
particular
during
the
period
of
puberty
and
idiotic
and
weak
persons
suffer
much
from
and
try
to
combat
the
oppressive
feeling
of
dejection
with
powerful
sense
stimuli
hence
they
are
easily
led
to
crime
especially
to
arson
it
is
asserted
that
uneducated
people
in
lonesome
very
isolated
regions
such
as
mountain
tops
great
moors
coast
country
are
particularly
subject
to
nostalgia
this
seems
to
be
true
and
is
explained
by
the
fact
that
educated
people
easily
find
diversion
from
their
sad
thoughts
and
in
some
degree
take
a
piece
of
home
with
them
in
their
more
or
less
international
culture
in
the
same
way
it
is
conceivable
that
inhabitants
of
a
region
not
particularly
individualized
do
not
so
easily
notice
differences
especially
he
who
passes
from
one
city
to
another
readily
finds
himself
but
mountain
and
plain
contain
so
much
that
is
contrary
that
the
feeling
of
strangeness
is
overmastering
so
then
if
the
person
is
able
he
tries
to
destroy
his
nostalgia
through
the
noisiest
and
most
exciting
pleasures
if
he
is
not
he
sets
fire
to
a
house
or
in
case
of
need
kills
somebody
in
short
what
he
needs
is
explosive
relief
such
events
are
so
numerous
that
they
ought
to
have
considerable
attention
nostalgia
should
be
kept
in
mind
where
no
proper
motive
for
violence
is
to
be
found
and
where
the
suspect
is
a
person
with
the
qualities
then
again
if
one
discovers
that
the
suspect
is
really
suffering
from
from
great
for
his
local
relations
one
has
a
point
from
which
the
criminal
may
be
reached
as
a
rule
such
very
pitiful
individuals
are
so
less
likely
to
deny
their
crime
in
the
degree
in
which
they
feel
unhappy
that
their
sorrow
is
not
perceivably
increased
through
arrest
besides
that
the
legal
procedure
to
which
they
are
subjected
is
a
not
undesired
new
and
powerful
stimulus
to
them
when
such
nostalgiacs
confess
their
deed
they
never
so
far
as
i
know
confess
its
motive
apparently
they
do
not
know
the
motive
and
hence
can
not
explain
the
deed
as
a
rule
one
hears
know
why
i
had
to
do
just
where
this
begins
to
be
abnormal
must
be
decided
by
the
physician
who
must
always
be
consulted
when
nostalgia
is
the
ground
for
a
crime
of
course
it
is
not
impossible
that
a
criminal
in
order
to
excite
pity
should
explain
his
crime
as
the
result
of
unconquerable
but
that
must
always
be
untrue
because
as
we
have
shown
anybody
who
acts
out
of
does
not
know
it
and
can
not
tell
it
section
reflex
actions
are
also
of
greater
significance
than
as
a
rule
they
are
supposed
to
be
according
to
lotze
actions
are
not
limited
to
habitual
and
insignificant
affairs
of
the
daily
life
even
compounded
series
of
actions
which
enclose
the
content
even
of
a
crime
may
come
to
actuality
in
this
way
in
a
single
moment
in
which
the
sufficient
opposition
of
some
other
emotional
condition
the
enduring
intensity
of
emotion
directed
against
an
obstacle
or
the
clearness
of
a
moving
series
of
ideas
is
lacking
the
deed
may
emerge
from
the
image
of
itself
without
being
caused
or
accompanied
by
any
resolve
of
the
doer
hearings
of
criminals
are
full
of
statements
which
point
to
such
a
realization
of
their
crimes
and
these
are
often
considered
inventions
inasmuch
as
people
fear
from
their
truth
a
disturbance
or
upsetting
of
the
notions
concerning
adjudication
and
actionability
the
mere
recognition
of
that
psychological
fact
alters
the
conventional
judgment
but
little
the
failure
in
these
cases
consists
in
not
having
prevented
that
automatic
transition
of
images
into
actions
a
transition
essentially
natural
to
our
organism
which
ought
however
like
so
many
other
things
to
be
subjected
to
power
of
the
reflex
movements
require
closer
study
the
most
numerous
and
generally
known
are
dropping
the
eyelids
coughing
sneezing
swallowing
all
involuntary
actions
against
approaching
or
falling
bodies
then
again
the
patellar
reflex
and
the
kremaster
reflex
etc
other
movements
of
the
same
kind
were
once
known
and
so
often
practised
that
they
became
involuntary
hence
for
example
the
foolish
question
how
a
person
believed
to
be
disguised
can
be
recognized
as
man
or
woman
the
well
known
answer
is
let
some
small
object
fall
on
his
lap
the
woman
will
spread
her
limbs
apart
because
she
is
accustomed
to
wear
a
dress
in
which
she
catches
the
object
the
man
will
bring
his
limbs
together
because
he
wears
trousers
and
is
able
to
catch
the
object
only
in
this
way
there
are
so
many
such
habitual
actions
that
it
is
difficult
to
say
where
actual
reflexes
end
and
habits
begin
they
will
be
properly
distinguished
when
the
first
are
understood
as
single
detached
movements
and
the
last
as
a
continuous
perhaps
even
unconscious
and
action
when
i
for
example
while
working
take
a
cigar
cut
off
the
end
light
it
smoke
and
later
am
absolutely
unaware
that
i
have
done
this
what
has
occurred
is
certainly
not
a
reflex
but
a
habitual
action
the
latter
does
not
belong
to
this
class
in
which
are
to
be
grouped
only
such
as
practically
bear
a
defensive
character
as
examples
of
how
such
movements
may
have
criminological
significance
only
own
experience
may
be
cited
because
it
is
so
difficult
to
put
oneself
at
the
point
of
view
of
another
i
want
to
consider
two
such
examples
one
evening
i
passed
through
an
unfrequented
street
and
came
upon
an
inn
just
at
the
moment
that
an
intoxicated
fellow
was
thrown
out
and
directly
upon
me
at
the
very
instant
i
hit
the
poor
fellow
a
hard
blow
on
the
ear
i
regretted
the
deed
immediately
the
more
so
as
the
assaulted
man
bemoaned
his
misfortune
they
throw
him
out
outside
they
box
his
suppose
that
i
had
at
that
time
burst
the
or
otherwise
damaged
him
heavily
it
would
have
been
a
criminal
matter
and
i
doubt
whether
anybody
would
have
believed
that
it
was
a
action
though
i
was
then
as
convinced
that
the
action
was
reflex
i
in
the
least
know
what
was
going
to
happen
to
me
and
what
i
should
do
i
simply
noticed
that
something
unfriendly
was
approaching
and
i
met
it
with
a
defensive
action
in
the
form
of
an
on
the
ear
what
properly
occurred
i
knew
only
when
i
heard
the
blow
and
felt
the
concussion
of
my
hand
something
similar
happened
to
me
when
i
was
a
student
i
had
gone
into
the
country
hunting
before
dawn
when
some
one
hundred
paces
from
the
house
right
opposite
me
a
great
ball
rolled
down
a
narrow
way
without
knowing
what
it
was
or
why
i
did
it
i
hit
at
the
ball
heavily
with
an
alpenstock
i
carried
in
my
hand
and
the
thing
emerged
as
two
fighting
tomcats
with
teeth
fixed
in
each
other
one
of
them
was
my
beloved
possession
so
that
i
keenly
regretted
the
deed
but
even
here
i
had
not
acted
consciously
i
had
simply
smashed
away
because
something
unknown
was
approaching
me
if
i
had
then
done
the
greatest
damage
i
could
not
have
been
held
responsible
my
explanation
were
allowed
but
it
would
have
been
allowed
i
do
not
believe
in
this
case
either
a
closer
examination
of
reflex
action
requires
consideration
of
certain
properties
which
in
themselves
can
not
easily
have
criminal
significance
but
which
tend
to
make
that
significance
clearer
one
is
the
circumstance
that
there
are
reflexes
which
work
while
you
sleep
that
we
do
not
excrete
during
sleep
depends
on
the
fact
that
the
faeces
pressing
in
the
large
intestine
generates
a
reflexive
action
of
the
constrictors
of
the
rectum
they
can
be
brought
to
relax
only
through
especially
powerful
pressure
or
through
the
voluntary
relaxation
of
own
constrictors
the
second
suggestive
circumstance
is
the
fact
that
even
habitual
reflexes
may
under
certain
conditions
especially
when
a
particularly
weighty
different
impression
comes
at
the
same
time
not
take
place
it
is
a
reflex
for
example
to
withdraw
the
hand
when
it
feels
pain
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
one
is
so
absorbed
with
another
matter
as
to
be
unaware
of
the
whole
process
but
if
interest
in
this
other
matter
is
so
sufficiently
fixed
as
to
make
one
forget
as
the
saying
goes
the
whole
outer
world
the
outer
impression
of
pain
must
have
been
very
intense
in
order
to
awaken
its
proper
reflex
the
attention
may
however
not
be
disturbed
at
all
and
yet
the
reflex
may
fail
if
we
suppose
that
a
reflex
action
is
one
brought
about
through
the
excitement
of
an
afferent
sensory
nerve
which
receives
the
stimulation
and
brings
it
to
the
center
from
which
the
excitement
is
transferred
to
the
motor
series
landois
we
exclude
the
activity
of
the
brain
but
this
exclusion
deals
only
with
conscious
activity
and
the
direct
transition
through
the
reflex
center
can
happen
successfully
only
because
the
brain
has
been
consciously
at
work
innumerable
times
so
that
it
is
co√∂perating
in
the
later
cases
also
without
our
knowing
it
when
however
the
brain
is
brought
into
play
through
some
other
particularly
intense
stimuli
it
is
unable
to
contribute
that
unconscious
c√∂operation
and
hence
the
reflex
action
is
not
performed
on
this
point
i
have
i
believe
an
instructive
and
evidential
example
one
of
my
maids
opened
a
pasted
with
paper
at
the
corner
by
tearing
the
paper
along
the
length
of
the
box
with
her
apparently
the
box
was
or
the
action
was
too
rapidly
made
for
the
matches
flamed
up
explosively
and
the
whole
box
was
set
on
fire
what
was
notable
was
the
fact
that
the
girl
threw
the
box
away
neither
consciously
nor
instinctively
she
shrieked
with
fright
and
kept
the
box
in
her
hand
at
her
cry
my
son
rushed
in
from
another
room
and
only
after
he
had
shouted
as
loudly
as
possible
it
away
drop
it
did
she
do
so
she
had
kept
the
burning
thing
in
her
hand
long
enough
to
permit
my
son
to
pass
from
one
room
into
another
and
her
wound
was
so
serious
that
it
needed
medical
treatment
for
weeks
when
asked
why
she
kept
the
burning
box
in
her
hand
in
spite
of
really
very
terrible
pain
she
simply
declared
that
think
of
it
though
she
added
that
when
she
was
told
to
throw
the
thing
away
it
just
occurred
to
her
that
that
would
be
the
wisest
of
all
things
to
do
what
happened
then
was
obviously
this
fear
and
pain
so
completely
absorbed
the
activity
of
the
brain
that
it
was
not
only
impossible
for
it
consciously
to
do
the
right
thing
it
was
even
unable
to
assist
in
the
unconscious
execution
of
the
reflex
this
fact
suggests
that
the
sole
activity
of
the
spinal
cord
does
not
suffice
for
reflexes
since
if
it
did
those
would
occur
even
when
the
brain
is
otherwise
profoundly
engaged
as
they
do
not
so
occur
the
brain
also
must
be
in
play
now
this
distinction
is
not
indifferent
for
us
for
if
we
hold
that
the
brain
acts
during
reflexes
we
have
to
grant
the
possibility
of
degrees
in
its
action
thus
where
brain
activity
is
in
question
the
problem
of
responsibility
also
arises
and
we
must
hold
that
wherever
a
reflex
may
be
accepted
as
the
cause
of
a
crime
the
subject
of
the
degree
of
punishment
must
be
taken
exceptionally
into
account
it
is
further
to
be
noted
that
as
a
matter
of
official
consideration
the
problem
of
the
presence
of
reflexes
ought
to
be
studied
since
it
rarely
occurs
that
a
man
says
was
purely
a
reflex
he
says
perhaps
know
how
it
happened
or
do
otherwise
or
he
denies
the
whole
event
because
he
really
was
not
aware
how
it
happened
that
the
questions
are
here
difficult
both
with
regard
to
the
taking
of
evidence
and
with
regard
to
the
judgment
of
guilt
is
obvious
and
it
is
therefore
indifferent
whether
we
speak
of
deficiency
in
or
of
and
malice
section
it
is
easy
to
write
a
book
on
the
significance
of
a
clothes
as
the
expression
of
his
inner
state
it
is
said
that
the
character
of
a
woman
is
to
be
known
from
her
shoe
but
actually
the
matter
reaches
far
beyond
the
shoe
to
every
bit
of
clothing
whether
of
one
sex
or
the
other
the
penologist
has
more
opportunity
than
any
one
else
to
observe
how
people
dress
to
take
notes
concerning
the
wearer
and
finally
to
correct
his
impressions
by
means
of
the
examination
in
this
matter
one
may
lay
down
certain
axioms
if
we
see
a
man
whose
coat
is
so
patched
that
the
original
material
is
no
longer
visible
but
the
coat
nowhere
shows
a
hole
if
his
shirt
is
made
of
the
very
coarsest
and
equally
patched
material
but
is
clean
and
if
his
shoes
are
very
bad
but
are
whole
and
well
polished
we
should
consider
him
and
his
wife
as
honest
people
without
ever
making
an
error
we
certainly
see
very
little
wisdom
in
our
modern
painfully
attired
we
suspect
the
suggestively
dressed
woman
of
some
little
disloyalty
to
her
husband
and
we
certainly
expect
no
low
inclinations
from
the
lady
dressed
with
intelligent
simple
respectability
if
a
general
appearance
is
correct
it
indicates
refinement
and
attention
to
particular
things
anybody
who
considers
this
question
finds
daily
new
information
and
new
and
reliable
inferences
anyway
everybody
has
a
different
viewpoint
in
this
matter
a
single
specific
detail
being
convincing
to
one
to
another
only
when
taken
in
connection
with
something
else
and
to
a
third
when
connected
with
still
a
third
phenomenon
it
may
be
objected
that
at
least
detailed
and
prolonged
observations
are
necessary
before
inferences
should
be
drawn
from
the
way
of
dressing
inasmuch
as
a
passing
inclination
economic
conditions
may
exert
no
little
influence
by
compelling
an
individual
to
a
specific
choice
in
dress
such
influence
is
not
particularly
deep
a
person
subject
to
a
particular
inclination
may
be
sufficiently
under
given
circumstances
and
that
he
was
compelled
by
his
situation
to
dress
in
one
way
rather
than
another
is
equally
has
anybody
seen
an
honest
farm
hand
wearing
a
evening
coat
he
may
wear
a
most
threadbare
but
a
he
certainly
would
not
buy
even
if
he
could
get
it
cheap
nor
would
he
take
it
as
a
gift
he
leaves
such
clothes
to
others
whose
shabby
elegance
shows
at
a
glance
what
they
are
consider
how
characteristic
are
the
clothes
of
discharged
soldiers
of
hunters
of
officials
etc
who
fails
to
recognize
the
dress
of
a
real
clerical
of
democrats
of
their
dress
is
everywhere
as
well
defined
as
the
clothing
of
englishmen
frenchmen
germans
and
americans
formed
not
by
climatic
conditions
but
by
national
character
in
a
specific
and
quite
unalterable
way
conceit
carelessness
cleanliness
greasiness
anxiety
indifference
respectability
the
desire
to
attract
attention
and
to
be
original
all
these
and
innumerable
similar
and
related
qualities
express
themselves
nowhere
so
powerfully
and
indubitably
as
in
the
way
people
wear
their
clothes
and
not
all
the
clothes
together

time

the
science
of
physiognomy
belongs
to
those
disciplines
which
show
a
decided
variability
in
their
value
in
classical
times
it
was
set
much
store
by
and
socrates
plato
aristotle
and
pythagoras
were
keenly
interested
in
its
doctrines
later
on
it
was
forgotten
was
studied
in
passing
when
baptista
porta
wrote
a
book
about
human
physiognomy
and
finally
when
the
works
of
lavater
and
the
closely
related
ones
of
gall
appeared
the
science
came
for
a
short
time
into
the
foreground
well
known
monograph
excited
great
attention
in
his
day
and
brought
its
author
enthusiastic
admiration
how
much
goethe
was
interested
in
it
is
indicated
in
the
popular
book
by
von
der
hellen
and
the
exchange
of
letters
between
goethe
and
lavater
if
lavater
had
not
brought
the
matter
into
relation
with
his
mystical
and
apodictic
manner
if
he
had
made
more
observations
and
fewer
assertions
his
fame
would
have
endured
longer
and
he
would
have
been
of
some
use
to
the
science
as
it
was
it
soon
slipped
from
minds
and
they
turned
to
the
notorious
phrenology
of
gall
gall
who
to
some
degree
had
worked
with
his
friend
spurzheim
committed
the
same
error
in
his
works
as
lavater
inasmuch
as
he
lost
himself
in
theories
without
scientific
basis
so
that
much
that
was
indubitably
correct
and
indicative
in
his
teaching
was
simply
overlooked
his
meaning
was
twice
validated
once
when
cotta
and
noel
studied
it
intensively
and
justly
assigned
him
a
considerable
worth
the
second
tune
when
lombroso
and
his
school
invented
the
doctrine
of
criminal
stigmata
the
best
of
which
rests
on
the
postulates
of
the
and
only
now
studied
gall
the
great
physiologist
m√ºller
declared
the
general
possibility
of
the
principles
of
system
no
a
priori
objections
can
be
only
recently
were
the
important
problems
of
physiognomy
if
we
except
the
remarkable
work
by
schack
scientifically
dealt
with
the
most
important
and
significant
book
is
then
the
system
of
piderit
and
all
of
them
being
based
upon
the
earlier
fundamental
work
of
the
excellent
english
anatomist
and
surgeon
bell
other
works
of
importance
are
those
of
lebrun
reich
mantegazza

etc
the
present
status
of
physiognomics
is
we
must
say
a
very
subordinate
one
phrenology
is
related
to
physiognomics
as
the
bony
support
of
the
skull
to
its
softer
ones
and
as
a
physiognomy
depends
especially
upon
the
conformation
of
his
skull
so
physiognomics
must
deal
with
the
forms
of
the
skull
the
doctrine
of
the
movement
of
physiognomy
is
mimicry
but
physiognomics
concerns
itself
with
the
features
of
the
face
taken
in
themselves
and
with
the
changes
which
accompany
the
alterations
of
consciousness
whereas
mimicry
deals
with
the
voluntary
alterations
of
expression
and
gesture
which
are
supposed
to
externalize
internal
conditions
hence
mimicry
interests
primarily
actors
orators
and
the
ordinary
comedians
of
life
phrenology
remains
the
research
of
physicians
anthropologists
and
psychologists
so
that
the
science
of
physiognomy
as
important
in
itself
is
left
to
us
lawyers
its
value
as
a
discipline
is
variously
set
generally
it
is
asserted
that
much
indeed
fails
to
be
expressed
by
the
face
that
what
does
show
shows
according
to
no
fixed
rules
that
hence
whatever
may
be
read
in
a
face
is
derivable
either
instinctively
by
oneself
or
not
at
all
or
it
may
be
urged
the
matter
can
not
be
learned
such
statements
as
ways
of
disposing
of
things
occur
regularly
wherever
there
is
a
good
deal
of
work
to
do
people
do
not
like
to
bother
with
troublesome
problems
and
therefore
call
them
worthless
but
whoever
is
in
earnest
and
is
not
averse
to
a
little
study
will
get
much
benefit
from
intensive
application
to
this
discipline
in
relation
to
his
profession
the
right
of
physiognomies
to
the
status
of
an
independent
science
is
to
some
degree
established
in
the
dictum
that
whatever
is
valid
in
its
simplest
outline
must
be
capable
of
extension
and
development
no
man
doubts
that
there
are
intelligent
faces
and
foolish
ones
kind
ones
and
cruel
ones
and
if
this
assertion
is
admitted
as
it
stands
it
must
follow
that
still
other
faces
may
be
distinguished
so
that
it
is
possible
to
read
a
certain
number
of
spiritual
qualities
from
the
face
and
inasmuch
as
nobody
can
indicate
the
point
at
which
this
reading
of
features
must
cease
the
door
is
opened
to
examination
observation
and
the
collection
of
material
then
if
one
bewares
of
voluntary
mistakes
of
exaggeration
and
unfounded
assertion
if
one
builds
only
upon
actual
and
carefully
observed
facts
an
important
and
discipline
must
ensue
the
exceptionally
acute
psychiatrist
meynert
shows
how
physiognomics
depends
on
irradiation
and
parallel
images
he
shows
what
a
large
amount
of
material
having
physiognomical
contents
we
keep
in
mind
completely
valueless
as
are
the
fixed
forms
by
which
mankind
judges
the
voluntary
acts
of
its
individual
members
they
point
to
the
universal
conclusion
that
it
is
proper
to
infer
from
the
voluntary
acts
of
a
person
whose
features
correspond
to
those
of
another
the
voluntary
acts
of
the
other

hans
very
detailed
physiognomical
observations
concerning
the
expression
of
interest
in
the
eyes
by
means
of
the

very
considerable
physiognomical
value
the
pupil
he
believes
is
the
gate
through
which
our
glance
passes
into
the
inner
life
of
our
neighbor
the
psychical
is
already
close
at
hand
with
the
word
how
this
occurs
why
rather
this
and
not
another
muscle
is
innervated
in
the
development
of
a
certain
process
we
do
not
know
but
our
ignorance
does
not
matter
since
ultimately
a
man
might
split
his
head
thinking
why
we
do
not
hear
with
our
eyes
and
see
with
our
ears
but
to
some
extent
we
have
made
observable
progress
in
this
matter
as
far
back
as
m√ºller
wrote
reasons
are
unknown
why
various
psychoses
make
use
of
different
groups
of
nerves
or
why
certain
facial
muscles
are
related
to
certain
gratiolet
thought
it
necessary
forty
years
ago
to
deny
that
muscles
were
developed
merely
for
the
purpose
of
expression
almost
contemporaneously
piderit
knew
that
expressive
muscular
movements
refer
partly
to
imaginary
objects
and
partly
to
imaginary
sense
impressions
in
this
fact
lies
the
key
to
the
meaning
of
all
expressive
muscular
movements
book
on
the
expressions
of
the
emotions
finally
established
the
matter
so
completely
and
firmly
that
we
may
declare
ourselves
in
possession
of
enough
material
for
our
purpose
to
make
it
possible
to
carry
our
studies
further
the
study
of
this
book
of
i
believe
absolutely
necessary
to
each
criminalist
for
he
meets
in
every
direction
expositions
and
explanations
that
are
related
to
cases
he
has
already
experienced
in
practice
or
is
sure
to
experience
i
present
here
only
a
few
of
most
important
notes
and
observations
in
order
to
demonstrate
their
utility
for
our
purpose
as
subjects
for
study
he
recommends
children
because
they
permit
forms
of
expression
to
appear
vigorously
and
without
constraint
lunatics
because
they
are
subject
to
strong
passions
without
control
galvanized
persons
in
order
to
facilitate
the
muscles
involved
and
finally
to
establish
the
identity
of
expression
among
all
races
of
men
and
beasts
of
these
objects
only
children
are
important
for
our
purpose
the
others
either
are
far
removed
from
our
sphere
of
activity
or
have
only
theoretic
value
i
should
however
like
to
add
to
the
subjects
of
observation
another
the
simple
unstudied
persons
peasants
and
such
otherwise
unspoiled
individuals
whom
we
may
believe
innocent
of
all
intention
to
play
a
comedy
with
us
we
can
learn
much
from
such
people
and
from
children
and
it
is
to
be
believed
that
in
studying
them
we
are
studying
not
a
special
class
but
are
establishing
a
generally
valid
paradigm
of
the
whole
of
mankind
children
have
the
same
features
as
adults
only
clearer
and
simpler
for
suppose
we
consider
any
one
of
dicta
that
in
the
expression
of
anger
and
indignation
the
eyes
shine
respiration
becomes
more
rapid
and
intense
the
nostrils
are
somewhat
raised
the
look
misses
the
opponent
these
so
intensely
characteristic
indices
occur
equally
in
the
child
and
the
adult
neither
shows
more
or
fewer
and
once
we
have
defined
them
in
the
child
we
have
done
it
for
the
adult
also
once
the
physiognomy
of
children
and
simple
people
has
been
studied
the
further
study
of
different
kinds
of
people
is
no
longer
difficult
there
is
only
the
intentional
and
customary
masking
of
expression
to
look
out
for
for
the
rest
the
already
acquired
principles
mutandis
mutatis
are
to
be
used
darwin
posits
three
general
principles
on
which
most
expressions
and
gestures
are
to
be
explained
they
are
briefly
i
the
principle
of
purposeful
associated
habits
ii
the
principle
of
contradication
iii
the
principle
of
the
direct
activity
of
the
nervous
system
with
regard
to
the
first
when
in
the
course
of
a
long
series
of
generations
any
desire
experience
or
disinclination
has
led
to
some
voluntary
action
then
as
often
as
the
same
or
any
analogous
associated
experience
is
undergone
there
will
arise
a
tendency
to
the
realization
of
a
similar
action
this
action
may
no
longer
have
any
use
but
is
inherited
and
generally
becomes
a
mere
reflex
this
becomes
clearer
when
one
notices
how
often
habit
facilitates
very
complex
action
the
habits
of
animals
the
high
steps
of
horses
the
pointing
of
pointers
the
sucking
of
calves
etc
it
is
difficult
for
us
in
falling
to
make
opposite
movements
to
stretching
out
the
arms
even
in
bed
we
draw
on
our
gloves
unconsciously
gratiolet
says
energetically
denies
some
point
shuts
his
eyes
if
he
assents
he
nods
and
opens
his
eyes
wide
whoever
describes
a
terrible
thing
shuts
his
eyes
and
shakes
his
head
whoever
looks
closely
raises
his
in
the
attempt
to
think
the
same
thing
is
done
or
the

contracted
both
make
the
glance
keener
thence

the

with

to
the
second
dogs
who
are

with
cats

the
appearance
of

if
they
are

the
opposite
although
this
serves
no
purpose
taylor
says
that
the
gesture
language
of
the
cistercians
depends
considerably
on
antithesis
shrugging
the
shoulders
is
the
opposite
of
firmness

of

etc
with
these
subdivisions
it
will
be
possible
to
find
some
thoroughfare
and
to
classify
every
phenomenon
we
want
to
discuss
a
few
more
particulars
in
the
light
of
examples
he
warns
us
first
of
all
against
seeing
certain
muscle
movements
as
the
result
of
emotional
excitement
because
they
were
looked
for
there
are
countless
habits
especially
among
the
movements
of
the
features
which
happen
accidentally
or
as
the
result
of
some
passing
pain
and
which
have
no
significance
such
movements
are
often
of
the
greatest
clearness
and
do
not
permit
the
unexperienced
observer
to
doubt
that
they
have
important
meanings
although
they
have
no
relation
whatever
to
any
emotional
condition
even
if
it
is
agreed
only
to
depend
on
changes
of
the
whole
face
already
established
as
having
a
definite
meaning
there
is
still
danger
of
making
mistakes
because
well
accredited
facial
conditions
may
occur
in
another
way
as
matters
of
habit
nervous
disturbances
wounds
hence
in
this
matter
too
care
and
attention
are
required
for
if
we
make
use
of
any
one
of
the
darwinian
norms
as
for
example
that
the
eyes
are
closed
when
we
do
not
want
to
see
a
thing
or
when
we
dislike
it
we
still
must
grant
that
there
are
people
to
whom
it
has
become
habitual
to
close
their
eyes
under
other
and
even
opposed
conditions
we
must
grant
that
with
the
exception
of
such
cases
the
phenomena
are
significant
during
examinations
as
when
we
show
the
accused
a
very
effective
piece
of
evidence
a
comparison
of
which
is
evidential
and
he
closes
his
eyes
the
act
is
then
characteristic
and
of
importance
particularly
when
his
words
are
intended
to
contest
the
meaning
of
the
object
in
question
the
contradiction
between
the
movement
of
his
eyes
and
his
words
is
then
suggestive
enough
the
same
occurs
when
the
accused
is
shown
the
various
possibilities
that
lie
before
him
the
movement
of
the
examination
the
correlations
and
consequences
if
he
finds
them
dangerous
he
closes
his
eyes
so
with
witnesses
also
when
one
of
them
deposes
to
more
and
more
harmfully
than
according
to
our
own
notion
he
can
explain
he
will
close
his
eyes
though
perhaps
for
an
instant
only
if
the
inevitable
consequences
of
his
deposition
are
expounded
to
him
if
he
closes
his
eyes
he
has
probably
said
too
much
and
the
proper
moment
must
not
be
missed
to
appeal
to
his
conscience
and
to
prevent
more
exaggerated
and
irresponsible
assertions
this
form
of
closing
the
eyes
is
not
to
be
confused
with
the
performances
of
persons
who
want
to
understand
the
importance
of
their
depositions
and
to
collect
their
senses
or
who
desire
to
review
the
story
mentally
and
consider
its
certainty
these
two
forms
of
closing
the
eyes
are
different
the
first
which
wants
to
shut
out
the
consequences
of
testimony
is
much
shorter
the
latter
longer
because
it
requires
a
good
deal
of
time
to
collect
senses
and
to
consider
a
problem
the
first
moreover
is
accompanied
by
a
perceivable
expression
of
fear
while
the
latter
is
manifest
only
by
its
duration
what
is
most
important
is
a
characteristic
contemporary
and
perceivable
defensive
movement
of
the
hand
and
this
occurs
only
in
the
cases
where
the
desire
is
to
exclude
this
movement
occurs
even
among
very
phlegmatic
persons
and
hence
is
comparatively
reliable
it
is
not
made
by
people
who
want
undisturbedly
to
study
a
question
and
to
that
end
shut
their
eyes
in
a
similar
way
there
is
significance
in
the
sudden
closing
of
the
mouth
by
either
the
accused
or
the
witness
resolution
and
the
shutting
of
the
mouth
are
inseparable
it
is
as
impossible
to
imagine
a
vacillating
doubting
person
with
lips
closely
pressed
together
as
a
firm
and
resolute
person
with
open
mouth
the
reason
implies
first
law
that
of
purposeful
associated
habits
when
a
man
firmly
resolves
upon
some
deed
the
resolution
begins
immediately
to
express
itself
in
movements
which
are
closely
dependent
upon
bodily
actions
even
when
i
suddenly
resolve
to
face
some
disagreeable
matter
or
to
think
about
some
joyless
thing
a
bodily
movement
and
indeed
quite
an
energetic
one
will
ensue
upon
the
resolution
i
may
push
my
chair
back
raise
my
elbows
perhaps
put
my
head
quickly
between
my
hands
push
the
chair
back
again
and
then
begin
to
look
or
to
think
such
actions
however
require
comparatively
little
bodily
exertion
much
more
follows
on
different
types
of
resolutions
in
short
a
firm
resolution
requires
a
series
of
movements
immediately
to
follow
its
being
made
and
if
we
are
to
move
the
muscles
must
be
contracted
and
it
is
of
course
obvious
that
only
those
muscles
can
be
set
in
action
which
are
according
to
the
immediate
situation
of
the
body
free
to
move
if
we
are
sitting
down
for
example
we
can
not
easily
make
our
feet
conform
to
the
movement
of
a
march
forward
nor
can
we
do
much
with
the
thighs
hence
the
only
muscles
we
can
use
are
those
of
the
face
and
of
the
upper
limbs
so
then
the
mouth
is
closed
because
its
muscles
are
contracted
and
with
equal
significance
the
arms
are
thrust
outward
sharply
the
fist
clenched
and
the
forearm
bent
anybody
may
try
the
experiment
for
himself
by
going
through
the
actions
enumerated
and
seeing
whether
he
does
not
become
filled
with
a
sense
of
resolution
it
is
to
be
especially
observed
as
has
already
been
indicated
that
not
only
are
mental
states
succeeded
by
external
movements
but
imitated
external
movements
of
any
kind
awaken
or
at
least
plainly
suggest
their
correlated
mental
states
if
then
we
observe
in
any
person
before
us
the
signs
of
resolution
we
may
certainly
suppose
that
they
indicate
a
turn
in
what
he
has
said
and
what
he
is
going
to
say
if
they
be
observed
in
the
accused
then
he
has
certainly
resolved
to
pass
from
denial
to
confession
or
to
stick
to
his
denial
or
to
confess
or
keep
back
the
names
of
his
accomplices
the
rendezvous
etc
inasmuch
as
in
action
there
is
no
other
alternative
than
saying
or
not
saying
so
it
might
be
supposed
that
there
is
nothing
important
in
the
foregoing
statement
the
point
of
importance
lies
however
in
the
fact
that
a
resolution
has
been
reached
of
which
the
court
is
aware
and
from
which
a
departure
will
hardly
be
made
therefore
what
follows
upon
the
resolution
so
betrayed
we
can
not
properly
perceive
we
know
only
that
it
in
all
likelihood
consists
of
what
succeeds
it
the
accused
either
confesses
to
something
or
has
resolved
to
say
nothing
and
that
observation
saves
us
additional
labor
for
he
will
not
easily
depart
from
his
resolution
the
case
is
analogous
with
regard
to
the
witness
who
tells
no
truth
or
only
a
part
of
the
truth
he
reveals
the
marks
of
resolution
upon
deciding
finally
to
tell
the
truth
or
to
persist
in
his
lying
and
so
whatever
he
does
after
the
marks
of
resolution
are
noted
we
are
saved
unnecessary
effort
to
make
the
man
speak
one
way
or
another
it
is
particularly
interesting
to
watch
for
such
expressions
of
resolution
in
jurymen
especially
when
the
decision
of
guilt
or
innocence
is
as
difficult
as
it
is
full
of
serious
consequences
this
happens
not
rarely
and
means
that
the
juryman
observed
is
clear
in
his
own
mind
as
to
how
he
is
going
to
vote
whatever
testimony
may
succeed
this
resolution
is
then
indifferent
the
resolved
juryman
is
so
much
the
less
to
be
converted
as
he
usually
either
pays
no
more
attention
to
the
subsequent
testimony
or
hears
it
in
such
prejudiced
fashion
that
he
sees
everything
in
his
own
way
in
this
case
however
it
is
not
difficult
to
tell
what
the
person
in
question
has
decided
upon
if
the
action
we
now
know
follows
a
very
damaging
piece
of
testimony
the
defendant
is
condemned
thereby
if
it
follows
excusive
testimony
he
is
declared
innocent
anybody
who
studies
the
matter
may
observe
that
these
manifestations
are
made
by
a
very
large
number
of
jurymen
with
sufficient
clearness
to
make
it
possible
to
count
the
votes
and
predict
the
verdict
i
remember
vividly
in
this
regard
a
case
that
occurred
many
years
ago
three
men
a
peasant
and
his
two
sons
were
accused
of
having
killed
an
imbecile
who
was
supposed
to
have
boarded
in
their
house
the
jury
unanimously
declared
them
guiltless
really
because
of
failure
in
spite
of
much
effort
to
find
the
body
of
the
victim
later
a
new
witness
appeared
the
case
was
taken
up
again
and
about
a
year
after
the
first
trial
a
second
took
place
the
trial
consumed
a
good
many
days
in
which
the
three
defendants
received
a
flood
of
anonymous
letters
which
called
attention
mostly
to
the
fact
that
there
was
in
such
and
such
a
place
an
unknown
imbecile
woman
who
might
be
identical
with
the
ostensible
murdered
person
for
that
reason
the
defendant
appealed
for
a
postponement
of
the
trial
or
immediate
liberation
the
prosecutor
of
the
time
fought
the
appeal
but
held
that
so
far
as
the
case
went
and
it
was
pretty
bad
for
the
prosecution
the
action
taken
with
regard
to
the
appeal
was
indifferent
mills
of
the
gods
grind
slowly
he
concluded
in
his
oration
year
from
now
i
shall
appear
before
the
the
expression
of
this
conviction
that
the
defendants
were
guilty
on
the
part
of
a
man
who
because
of
his
great
talent
had
tremendous
influence
on
juries
caused
an
astounding
impression
the
instant
he
said
it
one
could
see
in
most
of
the
jurymen
clearest
signs
of
absolute
resolution
and
the
defendants
were
condemned
from
that
moment
correlated
with
the
signs
of
resolution
are
those
of
astonishment
hands
are
raised
in
the
air
says
darwin
the
palm
is
laid
on
the
in
addition
the
eyebrows
are
regularly
raised
and
people
of
not
too
great
refinement
beat
their
foreheads
and
in
many
cases
there
occurs
a
slight
winding
movement
of
the
trunk
generally
toward
the
left
the
reason
is
not
difficult
to
find
we
are
astonished
when
we
learn
something
which
causes
an
inevitable
change
in
the
familiar
course
of
events
when
this
occurs
the
hearer
finds
it
necessary
if
events
are
simple
properly
to
get
hold
of
it
when
i
hear
that
a
new
niebelungen
manuscript
has
been
discovered
or
a
cure
for
leprosy
or
that
the
south
pole
has
been
reached
i
am
astonished
but
immediate
conception
on
my
part
is
altogether
superfluous
but
that
ancient
time
in
which
our
habitual
movements
came
into
being
and
which
has
endured
longer
incomparably
longer
than
our
present
civilization
knew
nothing
whatever
of
these
interests
of
the
modern
civilized
human
being
what
astonished
people
in
those
days
were
simple
external
and
absolutely
direct
novelties
that
a
flood
was
coming
that
game
was
near
the
camp
that
inimical
tribes
had
been
observed
in
short
events
that
required
immediate
action
from
this
fact
spring
our
significant
movements
which
must
hence
be
perceivably
related
to
the
beginning
of
some
necessary
action
we
raise
our
hands
when
we
want
to
jump
up
we
elevate
our
eyebrows
when
we
look
up
to
see
further
into
the
distance
we
slap
our
foreheads
in
order
to
stimulate
the
muscles
of
our
legs
dormant
because
of
long
sitting
we
lay
the
palms
of
our
hands
on
our
mouths
and
turn
the
trunk
because
we
discover
in
the
course
of
life
rather
more
disagreeable
than
pleasant
things
and
hence
we
try
to
keep
them
out
and
to
turn
away
from
them
and
astonishment
is
expressed
by
any
and
all
of
these
contradictory
movements
in
law
these
stigmata
are
significant
when
the
person
under
examination
ought
to
be
astonished
at
what
is
told
him
but
for
one
reason
or
another
does
not
want
to
show
his
astonishment
this
he
may
hide
in
words
but
at
least
one
significant
gesture
will
betray
him
and
therefore
be
of
considerable
importance
in
the
case
so
suppose
that
we
present
some
piece
of
evidence
from
which
we
expect
great
results
if
they
do
not
come
we
may
perhaps
have
to
take
quite
another
view
of
the
whole
case
it
is
hence
important
not
to
be
fooled
about
the
effect
and
that
can
be
accomplished
only
through
the
observation
of
the
gestures
these
being
much
more
rarely
deceptive
than
words
scorn
manifests
itself
in
certain
nasal
and
oral
movements
the
nose
is
contracted
and
shows
creases
in
addition
you
may
count
the
sniffing
spitting
blowing
as
if
to
drive
something
away
folding
the
arms
and
raising
the
shoulders
the
action
seems
to
be
related
to
the
fact
that
among
savage
people
at
least
the
representation
of
a
worthless
low
and
despicable
person
is
brought
into
relation
with
the
spread
of
a
nasty
odor
the
hindoo
still
says
of
a
man
he
scorns
is
that
our
ancestors
thought
similarly
the
movement
of
the
nose
especially
raising
it
and
blowing
and
sniffing
makes
evident
in
addition
there
is
the
raising
of
the
shoulders
as
if
one
wanted
to
carry
the
whole
body
out
of
a
disgusting
atmosphere
the
conduct
here
is
briefly
the
conduct
of
the
proud
if
something
of
the
sort
is
observable
in
the
behavior
of
a
witness
it
will
as
a
rule
imply
something
good
about
him
the
accused
denies
thereby
his
identity
with
the
criminal
or
he
has
no
other
way
of
indicating
the
testimony
of
some
damaging
witness
as
slander
or
he
marks
the
whole
body
of
testimony
with
this
gesture
as
a
web
of
lies
the
case
is
similar
when
a
witness
so
conducts
himself
and
expresses
scorn
he
will
do
the
latter
when
the
defendant
or
a
false
witness
for
the
defense
accuses
him
of
slander
when
indelicate
motives
are
ascribed
to
him
or
earlier
complicity
with
the
criminal
etc
the
situations
which
give
a
man
opportunity
to
show
that
he
despises
anybody
are
generally
such
as
are
to
the
advantage
of
the
scorner
they
are
important
legally
because
they
not
only
show
the
scorner
in
a
good
light
but
also
indicate
that
the
scorn
must
be
studied
more
closely
it
is
of
course
naturally
true
that
scorn
is
to
a
great
degree
simulated
and
for
that
reason
the
gestures
in
question
must
be
attentively
observed
real
scorn
is
to
be
distinguished
from
artificial
scorn
almost
always
by
the
fact
that
the
latter
is
attended
by
unnecessary
smiling
it
is
popularly
and
correctly
held
that
the
smile
is
the
weapon
of
the
silent
that
kind
of
smile
appears
however
only
as
defense
against
the
less
serious
accusations
or
perhaps
even
more
serious
ones
but
obviously
never
when
evil
consequences
attendant
on
serious
accusations
are
involved
if
indubitable
evil
is
in
question
no
really
innocent
person
smiles
for
he
scorns
the
person
he
knows
to
be
lying
and
manifests
other
gestures
than
the
smile
even
the
most
confused
individual
who
is
trying
to
conceal
his
stupidity
behind
a
flat
sort
of
laughter
gives
this
up
when
he
is
so
slandered
that
he
is
compelled
to
scorn
the
liar
only
the
simulator
continues
to
smile
if
however
anybody
has
practised
the
manifestation
of
scorn
he
knows
that
he
is
not
to
smile
but
then
his
pose
becomes
theatrical
and
betrays
itself
through
its
exaggeration
not
far
from
scorn
are
defiance
and
spite
they
are
characterized
by
baring
the
canine
teeth
and
drawing
together
the
face
in
a
frown
when
turning
toward
the
person
upon
whom
the
defiance
or
spite
is
directed
i
believe
that
this
image
has
got
to
be
variously
filled
out
by
the
additional
fact
that
the
mouth
is
closed
and
the
breath
several
times
forced
sharply
through
the
nostrils
this
arises
from
the
combination
of
resolution
and
scorn
these
being
the
probable
sources
of
defiance
and
spite
as
was
explained
in
the
discussion
of
resolution
the
mouth
is
bound
to
close
spite
and
defiance
are
not
thinkable
with
open
mouth
scorn
moreover
demands
as
we
have
shown
this
blowing
and
if
the
blowing
is
to
be
done
while
the
mouth
is
closed
it
must
be
done
through
the
nose
derision
and
depreciation
show
the
same
expressions
as
defiance
and
spite
but
in
a
lesser
degree
they
all
give
the
penologist
a
good
deal
to
do
and
those
defendants
who
show
defiance
and
spite
are
not
unjustly
counted
as
the
most
difficult
we
have
to
deal
with
they
require
above
all
conscientious
care
and
patience
just
indeed
because
not
rarely
there
are
innocents
among
them
this
is
especially
so
when
a
person
many
times
punished
is
accused
another
time
perhaps
principally
because
of
his
record
then
the
bitterest
defiance
and
almost
childish
spite
takes
possession
of
him
against
mankind
particularly
if
for
the
nonce
he
is
innocent
such
persons
turn
their
spite
upon
the
judge
as
the
representative
of
this
injustice
and
believe
they
are
doing
their
best
by
conducting
themselves
in
an
insulting
manner
and
speaking
only
a
few
defiant
words
with
the
grimmest
spite
under
such
circumstances
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
inexperienced
judge
considers
these
expressions
as
the
consequences
of
a
guilty
conscience
and
that
the
spiteful
person
may
blame
himself
for
the
results
of
his
defiant
conduct
he
therefore
pays
no
more
attention
to
the
unfortunate
how
this
situation
may
lead
to
an
unjust
sentence
is
obvious
but
whether
the
person
in
question
is
guilty
or
not
guilty
it
is
the
undeniable
duty
of
the
judge
to
make
especial
efforts
with
such
persons
for
defiance
and
spite
are
in
most
cases
the
result
of
embitterment
and
this
again
comes
from
the
disgusting
treatment
received
at
the
hands
of
fellows
and
it
is
the
duty
at
least
not
to
increase
this
guilt
if
he
can
not
wipe
it
away
the
only
and
apparently
the
simplest
way
of
dealing
with
such
people
is
the
patient
and
earnest
discussion
of
the
case
the
demonstration
that
the
judge
is
ready
carefully
to
study
all
damaging
facts
and
even
a
tendency
to
refer
to
evidence
of
innocence
in
hand
and
a
not
discussion
of
the
possible
guilt
in
most
cases
this
will
not
be
useful
at
the
beginning
the
man
must
have
time
to
think
the
thing
over
to
conceive
in
the
lonely
night
that
it
is
not
altogether
the
plan
to
ruin
him
then
when
he
begins
to
recognize
that
he
will
only
hurt
himself
by
his
spiteful
silence
if
he
is
again
and
again
examined
he
will
finally
be
amenable
once
the
ice
is
broken
even
those
accused
who
at
the
beginning
showed
only
spite
and
defiance
show
themselves
the
most
tractable
and
honest
the
thing
needful
above
all
is
patience
real
rage
unfortunately
is
frequent
the
body
is
carried
erect
or
thrown
forward
the
limbs
become
stiff
mouth
and
teeth
closely
press
together
the
voice
becomes
very
loud
or
dies
away
or
grows
hoarse
the
forehead
is
wrinkled
and
the
pupil
of
the
eye
contracted
in
addition
one
should
count
the
change
of
color
the
flush
or
deep
pallor
an
opportunity
to
simulate
real
rage
is
rare
and
anyway
the
characteristics
are
so
significant
that
a
mistake
in
recognition
can
hardly
be
made
darwin
says
that
the
conviction
of
own
guilt
is
from
time
to
time
expressed
through
a
sparkling
of
the
eyes
and
through
an
undefinable
affectation
the
last
is
well
known
to
every
penologist
and
explicable
in
general
psychological
terms
whoever
knows
himself
to
be
guiltless
behaves
according
to
his
condition
naturally
and
without
constraint
hence
the
notion
that
na√Øve
people
are
such
as
represent
matters
as
they
are
they
do
not
find
anything
suspicious
in
them
because
they
do
not
know
about
suspicious
matters
but
persons
who
know
themselves
guilty
and
try
not
to
show
it
must
attain
their
end
through
artifice
and
imitation
and
when
this
is
not
well
done
the
affectation
is
obvious
there
is
also
something
in
the
guilty
sparkle
of
the
eye
the
sparkle
in
the
eyes
of
beauty
the
glance
of
joy
of
enthusiasm
of
rapture
is
not
so
poetical
as
it
seems
inasmuch
as
it
is
no
more
than
intensified
secretion
of
tears
the
latter
gets
its
increase
through
nervous
excitation
so
that
the
guilty
sparkle
should
also
be
of
the
same
nature
this
may
be
considered
as
in
some
degree
a
flow
of
tears
in
its
first
stages
an
important
gesture
is
that
of
resignation
which
expresses
itself
especially
as
folding
the
hands
in
lap
this
is
one
of
the
most
obvious
gestures
for
the
hands
in
the
is
proverbial
and
means
there
is
no
more
to
be
done
the
gesture
signifies
therefore
not
going
to
do
any
more
i
i
hence
it
must
be
granted
that
the
condition
of
resignation
and
its
gesture
can
have
no
significance
for
our
own
important
problem
the
problem
of
guilt
inasmuch
as
the
innocent
as
well
as
the
guilty
may
become
resigned
or
may
reach
the
limit
at
which
he
permits
everything
to
pass
without
his
interference
in
the
essence
and
expression
of
resignation
there
is
the
abandonment
of
everything
or
of
some
particular
thing
and
in
court
what
is
abandoned
is
the
hope
to
show
innocence
and
as
the
latter
may
be
real
as
well
as
merely
pleaded
this
gesture
is
a
definite
sign
in
certain
cases
it
is
to
be
noted
among
the
relations
and
friends
of
a
defendant
who
having
done
everything
to
save
him
recognize
that
the
evidence
of
guilt
is
irrefutable
it
is
again
to
be
noticed
among
courageous
lawyers
who
having
exerted
all
their
art
to
save
their
clients
perceive
the
failure
of
their
efforts
and
finally
the
defendants
show
it
who
have
clearly
recognized
the
danger
of
their
case
i
believe
that
it
is
not
an
empirical
accident
that
the
gesture
of
resignation
is
made
regularly
by
innocent
persons
the
guilty
man
who
finds
himself
caught
catches
at
his
head
perhaps
looks
toward
heaven
gritting
his
teeth
rages
against
himself
or
sinks
into
a
dull
apathy
but
the
essential
in
resignation
and
all
its
accompanying
movements
is
foreign
to
him
only
that
conforms
to
the
idea
of
resignation
which
indicates
a
surrender
the
cession
of
some
value
that
one
has
a
claim
on
if
a
man
has
no
claim
to
any
given
thing
he
can
not
resign
it
in
the
same
way
a
person
without
right
to
guiltlessness
and
recognition
will
instinctively
not
surrender
it
with
the
emotion
of
resignation
but
at
most
with
despair
or
anger
or
rage
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
guilty
do
not
exhibit
gestures
of
resignation
the
contraction
of
the
brow
occurs
in
other
cases
besides
those
mentioned
before
all
it
occurs
when
anything
is
dealt
with
intensively
increasing
with
the
increase
of
the
difficulty
of
the
subject
the
aboriginal
source
of
this
gesture
lies
in
the
fact
that
intensive
activities
involve
the
need
of
acuter
vision
and
this
is
in
some
degree
acquired
by
the
contraction
of
the
skin
of
the
forehead
above
the
eyebrows
for
vision
is
clarified
in
this
way
intensive
consideration
on
the
part
of
a
defendant
or
a
witness
and
the
establishment
of
its
reality
or
simulation
are
significant
in
determining
whether
he
himself
believes
the
truth
of
what
is
about
to
be
explained
let
us
suppose
that
the
issue
involves
proving
an
alibi
on
a
certain
definite
rather
remote
day
and
the
defendant
is
required
to
think
over
his
whereabouts
on
that
day
if
he
is
in
earnest
with
regard
to
the
establishment
of
his
alibi
if
he
really
was
not
there
and
did
not
do
the
thing
it
will
be
important
for
him
to
remember
the
day
in
question
and
to
be
able
to
name
the
witnesses
of
his
whereabouts
then
hence
he
will
think
intensively
but
if
he
has
claimed
an
alibi
dishonestly
as
is
frequent
with
criminals
in
order
to
make
people
conclude
that
nobody
has
the
right
to
demand
where
and
for
how
long
a
time
he
was
on
such
and
such
a
day
then
there
is
no
need
of
thinking
closely
about
something
that
has
not
happened
he
exhibits
in
such
cases
a
kind
of
thoughtfulness
which
is
not
however
earnest
and
profound
and
these
two
adjectives
describe
consideration
the
same
observations
are
to
be
made
in
regard
to
dishonest
witnesses
who
when
pressed
to
think
hard
only
simulate
doing
so
one
is
compelled
at
the
very
least
to
look
closely
after
the
witness
who
simply
imitates
intensive
thinking
without
showing
the
signs
proper
to
it
the
suspicion
of
false
testimony
is
then
justifiable
a
rather
different
matter
is
that
blank
expression
of
the
eyes
which
only
shows
that
its
possessor
is
completely
lost
in
his
thoughts
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
sharp
recollection
and
demands
above
all
things
being
let
alone
or
the
belief
of
being
so
in
this
case
no
distinguishing
gestures
are
made
though
the
forehead
mouth
or
chin
may
be
handled
only
however
when
embarrassment
occurs
when
the
man
observes
that
he
is
being
watched
or
when
he
discovers
that
he
has
forgotten
the
presence
of
other
people
it
is
supposed
that
this
does
not
occur
in
court
but
it
does
happen
not
infrequently
when
for
example
the
judge
after
some
long
discussion
with
the
accused
is
about
to
dictate
what
has
been
said
if
this
takes
rather
a
long
time
it
may
chance
that
the
witness
is
no
longer
listening
but
is
staring
vacantly
into
the
distance
he
is
then
reviewing
his
whole
life
or
the
development
and
consequences
of
his
deed
he
is
absorbed
in
a
intuitive
thought
in
the
reproduction
of
events
intensive
consideration
requires
the
combination
of
particulars
and
the
making
of
inferences
hence
the
form
of
thinking
we
have
just
been
speaking
of
is
merely
spiritual
it
is
when
this
takes
place
that
confessions
are
most
easy
to
get
if
only
the
judge
keeps
his
eyes
properly
open
that
contraction
of
the
brow
signifies
a
condition
of
disgust
is
well
known
but
there
is
yet
as
i
believe
a
still
other
use
of
this
contraction
its
combination
with
a
smile
indicating
disbelief
how
this
union
occurred
seems
comparatively
undiscoverable
perhaps
it
results
from
the
combination
of
the
smile
of
denial
with
the
frown
of
sharp
observation
but
the
gesture
is
in
any
event
reliable
and
may
not
easily
stand
for
anything
but
disbelief
and
doubt
hence
it
is
always
a
mistake
to
believe
that
anybody
who
makes
that
expression
believes
what
he
has
heard
if
you
test
it
experimentally
you
will
find
that
when
you
make
it
you
say
involuntarily
to
yourself
now
that
be
true
or
here
a
whopper
or
something
like
that
the
expression
occurs
most
frequently
in
confronting
witnesses
with
defendants
and
especially
witnesses
with
each
other
the
close
relation
of
the
contraction
of
the
brow
with
its
early
stage
a
slight
elevation
of
the
eyebrows
is
manifest
in
the
fact
that
it
occurs
under
embarrassment
not
very
regularly
but
almost
always
upon
the
perception
of
something
foreign
and
inexplicable
or
upon
getting
twisted
in
talk
in
fact
upon
all
such
conditions
which
require
greater
physical
and
psychical
clearness
of
vision
and
hence
the
shutting
out
of
superfluous
light
the
expression
may
be
important
on
the
face
of
a
defendant
who
asserts
that
he
does
not
understand
an
argument
intended
to
prove
his
guilt
if
he
is
guilty
he
obviously
knows
what
happened
in
the
commission
of
the
crime
and
thereby
the
argument
which
reproduces
it
and
even
if
he
assures
the
court
a
hundred
times
that
he
does
not
understand
it
he
is
either
trying
to
show
himself
innocent
or
wants
to
gain
time
for
his
answer
if
he
is
innocent
it
may
be
that
he
really
does
not
understand
the
argument
because
he
is
unaware
of
the
actual
situation
hence
he
will
frown
and
listen
attentively
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
argument
the
guilty
person
perhaps
also
aims
to
appear
enormously
attentive
but
he
does
not
contract
his
brow
because
he
does
not
need
to
sharpen
his
glance
he
knows
the
facts
accurately
enough
without
it
it
is
important
for
the
penologist
to
know
whether
a
man
has
in
the
course
of
his
life
undergone
much
anxiety
and
trouble
or
whether
he
has
lived
through
it
carelessly
concerning
these
matters
darwin
points
out
that
when
the
inner
ends
of
the
eyebrows
are
raised
certain
muscles
have
to
be
contracted
the
circular
ones
which
contract
the
eyebrows
and
the
pyramidal
muscle
of
the
nose
which
serve
both
to
pull
down
and
contract
the
eyelids
the
contraction
is
accomplished
through
the
vigorous
drawing
together
of
the
central
bundle
of
muscles
at
the
brow
these
muscles
by
contracting
raise
the
inner
ends
of
the
brow
and
since
the
muscles
which
contract
the
eyebrows
bring
them
together
at
the
same
time
their
inner
ends
are
folded
in
great
lumpy
creases
in
this
way
short
oblique
and
short
perpendicular
furrows
are
made
now
this
few
people
can
do
without
practice
many
can
never
perform
it
voluntarily
and
it
is
more
frequent
among
women
and
children
than
among
men
it
is
important
to
note
that
it
is
always
a
sign
of
spiritual
pain
not
physical
and
curiously
enough
it
is
as
a
rule
related
with
drawing
down
the
corners
of
the
mouth
further
to
study
the
movements
of
the
features
will
require
an
examination
into
the
reasons
for
the
action
of
these
and
not
other
muscles
as
accompaniments
of
the
psychical
states
piderit
holds
it
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
motor
nerves
which
supply
these
muscles
rise
right
next
to
the
purely
psychical
centers
and
hence
these
muscles
are
the
supports
of
the
organs
of
sense
the
latter
is
no
doubt
correct
but
the
first
statement
is
rather
doubtful
in
any
event
it
is
evident
that
the
features
contain
an
exceptionally
large
number
of
fine
muscles
with
especially
rich
motor
capacity
and
hence
move
together
and
in
accordance
with
the
psychical
conditions
it
may
be
that
the
other
muscles
of
the
body
have
also
a
share
in
this
but
that
we
fail
to
perceive
the
fact
such
movements
however
have
not
been
essential
we
may
take
it
as
a
general
rule
that
all
joyous
and
uplifting
emotions
even
astonishment
are
succeeded
by
the
raising
of
the
skin
of
the
forehead
the
nostrils
the
eyes
the
eyelids
while
sad
and
oppressing
emotions
have
the
contrary
effect
this
simple
and
easy
rule
renders
immediately
intelligible
many
an
otherwise
obscure
expression
which
we
find
important
but
concerning
the
meaning
of
which
we
are
in
doubt
the
development
of
a
movement
in
any
face
goes
according
to
harless
in
this
fashion
superior
motor
nerve
is
the
oculomotorius
the
stimulation
reaches
this
one
first
the
mildest
alteration
of
emotion
betrays
itself
most
rapidly
in
the
look
the
movement
and
condition
of
the
pupil
of
the
eye
if
the
impulse
is
stronger
it
strikes
the
roots
of
the
motor
end
of
the
trigeminus
and
the
movement
of
the
muscles
of
mastication
occur
then
the
intensified
affection
spreads
through
the
other
nobody
will
of
course
assert
that
even
a
completely
developed
physiognomical
science
will
help
us
over
all
our
difficulties
but
with
a
little
attention
it
can
help
us
to
a
considerable
degree
this
help
we
do
need
as
la
rochefoucauld
points
out
with
even
contemporary
correctness
is
easier
to
know
men
than
to
know
a
particular
section
the
physiognomy
of
the
hand
stands
close
to
that
of
the
face
in
significance
and
is
in
some
relations
of
even
greater
importance
because
the
expression
of
the
hand
permits
of
no
or
very
slight
simulation
a
hand
may
be
rendered
finer
or
coarser
may
be
rendered
light
or
dark
the
nails
may
be
cared
for
or
allowed
to
develop
into
claws
the
appearance
of
the
hand
may
be
altered
but
not
its
physiognomy
or
character
whoever
creases
his
face
in
the
same
way
for
a
thousand
times
finally
retains
the
creases
and
receives
from
them
a
determinate
expression
even
if
this
does
not
reveal
his
inner
state
but
whoever
does
the
same
thing
a
thousand
times
with
his
hand
does
not
thereby
impress
on
it
a
means
of
identification
the
frequent
tartuffian
rolling
of
the
eyes
finally
gives
the
face
a
pious
or
at
least
pietistic
expression
but
fold
your
hands
in
daily
prayer
for
years
and
nobody
would
discover
it
from
them
it
seems
however
of
little
use
to
know
that
human
hands
can
not
be
disguised
if
they
are
little
or
not
at
all
differentiated
but
as
it
happens
they
are
next
to
the
face
the
most
extremely
and
profoundly
differentiated
of
human
organs
and
a
general
law
teaches
us
that
different
effects
are
produced
by
different
causes
and
that
from
the
former
the
latter
may
be
inferred
if
then
we
observe
the
infinite
variety
of
the
human
hand
we
have
to
infer
an
equally
infinite
variety
of
influences
and
inasmuch
as
we
can
not
trace
these
influences
any
further
we
must
conclude
that
they
are
to
be
explained
causally
by
the
infinite
variety
of
psychical
states
whoever
studies
the
hand
psychologically
gains
in
the
course
of
time
a
great
deal
of
faith
in
what
the
hand
tells
him
and
finally
he
doubts
it
only
when
chirognomy
conflicts
with
physiognomy
if
in
such
cases
it
is
observed
that
the
hand
is
more
likely
to
be
correct
than
the
face
and
that
inferences
from
the
hand
more
rarely
show
themselves
to
be
false
one
is
reminded
of
the
dictum
of
aristotle
hand
is
the
organ
of
organs
the
instrument
of
instruments
in
the
human
if
this
is
correct
the
favored
instrument
must
be
in
the
closest
kind
of
relation
with
the
psyche
of
the
owner
but
if
this
relation
exists
there
must
be
an
interaction
also
if
the
hand
contained
merely
its
physical
structure
newton
would
never
have
said
evidence
lacking
the
thumb
would
convince
me
of
how
far
one
ought
to
establish
fundamental
propositions
in
this
matter
i
can
not
easily
say
perhaps
it
would
be
scientifically
most
correct
to
be
satisfied
for
the
time
with
collecting
the
carefully
and
keenly
observed
material
and
getting
the
anatomists
who
are
already
in
need
of
material
for
professional
investigations
to
take
the
matter
up
in
collecting
photographs
of
hands
belonging
to
persons
whose
characters
are
well
known
and
in
getting
a
sufficient
number
of
properly
equipped
persons
to
make
the
collection
if
we
had
enough
material
to
draw
fundamental
principles
from
much
that
has
been
asserted
by
bell
carus
allen
gessmann
liersch
landsberg
might
be
proved
and
tested
but
their
statements
are
still
subject
to
contradiction
because
their
fundamental
principles
are
not
sufficient
for
the
development
of
a
system
probably
nobody
will
doubt
some
of
the
more
common
statements
all
will
grant
with
winkelmann
that
a
beautiful
hand
is
in
keeping
with
a
beautiful
soul
or
with
balzac
that
people
of
considerable
intellect
have
handsome
hands
or
in
calling
the
hand
second
face
but
when
specific
of
the
hand
are
made
these
meet
with
much
doubt
so
for
example
esser
calls
the
hand
essentially
a
work
hand
the
essentially
a
masculine
hand
having
less
soul
and
refinement
of
character
than
will
and
purposefulness
so
again
the
hand
implies
generally
a
sanguine
character
and
the
hand
presents
itself
as
the
possession
of
beautiful
souls
and
noble
spirits
however
true
this
classification
may
be
the
establishment
and
description
of
the
various
significatory
signs
is
very
difficult
especially
because
the
forms
named
rarely
appear
in
clear
and
sharply
defined
subdivisions
the
boundaries
are
fluid
like
the
characters
themselves
and
where
the
properties
of
one
group
pass
almost
directly
into
the
other
both
description
and
recognition
are
difficult
if
then
we
can
not
depend
upon
a
systematic
and
at
present
remote
treatment
we
still
may
depend
on
observations
which
appear
as
reliable
presuppositions
in
the
light
of
their
frequent
repetition
not
essentially
psychological
but
of
importance
for
the
criminalist
are
the
inferences
we
may
draw
from
herbert
assertion
that
people
whose
ancestors
have
worked
with
their
hands
possess
heavy
hands
conversely
people
whose
ancestors
have
not
worked
hard
with
their
hands
possess
small
and
fine
hands
hence
the
small
delicate
hands
of
jews
the
frequent
perfection
of
form
and
invariable
smallness
of
the
hands
of
gypsies
who
have
inherited
their
hands
from
hindoos
and
the
racial
hands
of
real
aristocrats
that
hard
work
even
tumbling
piano
playing
should
alter
the
form
of
a
hand
is
since
muscles
grow
stronger
with
practice
and
the
skin
becomes
coarser
and
drawn
through
friction
sharp
wind
and
insufficient
care
as
is
well
known
physical
properties
are
hereditary
and
observable
in
any
study
of
races
is
it
any
wonder
that
a
skilled
glance
at
a
hand
may
uncover
a
number
of
facts
concerning
the
circumstances
of
his
life
nobody
doubts
that
there
are
raw
low
sensual
fat
hands
and
who
does
not
know
the
suffering
spiritual
refined
and
delicate
hand
hands
can
not
of
course
be
described
and
distinguished
according
to
fixed
classification
and
no
doubt
hellenbach
was
right
when
he
said
can
discover
the
cause
of
the
magic
charm
which
lies
in
one
out
of
a
hundred
thousand
equally
beautiful
hands
and
this
is
remarkable
because
we
are
not
fooled
through
a
well
cared
for
fine
and
elegant
hand
everybody
i
might
say
knows
the
convincing
quality
that
may
lie
in
the
enormous
leathery
fist
of
a
peasant
for
that
too
is
often
harmoniously
constructed
nicely
articulated
appears
peaceful
and
trustworthy
we
feel
that
we
have
here
to
do
with
a
man
who
is
honest
who
presents
himself
and
his
business
as
they
are
who
holds
fast
to
whatever
he
once
gets
hold
of
and
who
understands
and
is
accustomed
to
make
his
words
impressive
and
we
gain
this
conviction
not
only
through
the
evidence
of
honest
labor
performed
through
years
but
also
through
the
stability
and
determination
of
the
form
of
his
hands
on
the
other
hand
how
often
are
we
filled
with
distrust
at
the
sight
of
a
carefully
tended
pink
and
white
hand
of
an
elegant
gentleman
whether
because
we
dislike
its
condition
or
its
shape
or
because
the
form
of
the
nails
recalls
an
unpleasant
memory
or
because
there
is
something
wrong
about
the
arrangement
of
the
fingers
or
because
of
some
unknown
reason
we
are
warned
and
without
being
hypnotised
regularly
discover
that
the
warning
is
justified
certain
properties
are
sure
to
express
themselves
coldness
prudence
hardness
calm
consideration
greed
are
just
as
indubitable
in
the
hand
as
kindness
frankness
gentleness
and
honesty
the
enchantment
of
many
a
feminine
hand
is
easily
felt
the
surrender
the
softness
the
concession
the
refinement
and
honesty
of
many
a
woman
is
so
clear
and
open
that
it
streams
out
so
to
speak
and
is
perceivable
by
the
senses
to
explain
all
this
to
classify
it
scientifically
and
to
arrange
it
serially
would
be
nowadays
at
least
an
unscientific
enterprise
these
phenomena
pass
from
body
to
body
and
are
as
reliable
as
inexplicable
who
has
never
observed
them
and
although
his
attention
has
been
called
to
them
still
has
failed
to
notice
them
need
not
consider
them
but
persons
believing
in
them
must
be
warned
against
exaggeration
and
haste
the
one
advice
that
can
be
given
is
to
study
the
language
of
the
hand
before
officially
ignoring
it
not
to
decide
immediately
upon
the
value
of
the
observations
one
is
supposed
to
have
made
but
to
handle
them
cautiously
and
to
test
them
with
later
experiences
it
is
of
especial
interest
to
trace
the
movement
of
the
hand
especially
the
fingers
i
do
not
mean
those
movements
which
are
external
and
with
the
movements
of
the
arm
those
belong
to
mimicry
i
mean
those
that
begin
at
the
wrist
and
therefore
occur
in
the
hand
only
for
the
study
of
those
movements
the
hand
of
childhood
is
of
little
use
being
altogether
too
untrained
unskilled
and
neutral
it
shows
most
clearly
the
movement
of
the
desire
to
possess
of
catching
hold
and
drawing
toward
oneself
generally
toward
the
mouth
as
does
the
suckling
child
its
breast
this
movement
darwin
has
observed
even
among
kittens
the
masculine
hand
is
generally
too
heavy
and
slow
clearly
to
exhibit
the
more
refined
movements
these
are
fully
developed
only
in
the
feminine
particularly
in
the
hands
of
vivacious
nervous
and
spiritually
excitable
women
the
justice
who
observes
them
may
read
more
than
he
can
in
their
words
the
hand
lies
in
the
lap
apparently
inert
but
the
otherwise
well
concealed
anger
slowly
makes
a
fist
of
it
or
the
fingers
bend
characteristically
forward
as
if
they
wished
to
scratch
eyes
out
or
they
cramp
together
in
deep
pain
or
the
balls
of
the
four
other
fingers
pass
with
pleasure
over
the
ball
of
the
thumb
or
they
move
spasmodically
nervously
impatiently
and
fearfully
or
they
open
and
close
with
characteristic
enjoyment
like
the
paws
of
cats
when
the
latter
feel
quite
spry
closer
observation
will
show
that
toes
reveal
a
great
deal
particularly
among
women
who
wear
rather
fine
shoes
and
hence
can
move
their
feet
with
greater
ease
in
anger
when
they
can
not
because
it
would
be
suggestive
stamp
their
feet
the
women
press
their
toes
closely
to
the
ground
if
they
are
embarrassed
they
turn
the
sole
of
their
shoe
slightly
inwards
and
make
small
curves
with
the
point
on
the
ground
impatience
shows
itself
through
alternating
and
swinging
pressure
of
heel
and
toe
repeated
with
increasing
rapidity
defiance
and
demand
through
raising
the
toes
in
such
a
way
that
the
sole
is
directly
forward
and
the
foot
rests
only
on
the
heel
sensuality
is
always
indicated
when
the
foot
is
put
forward
and
the
shin
bone
lightly
stretched
out
when
all
the
toes
are
drawn
in
toward
the
sole
just
as
the
cat
does
when
she
feels
good
what
women
do
not
say
in
words
and
do
not
express
in
their
features
and
do
not
indicate
in
the
movement
of
their
hands
they
say
with
their
feet
the
inner
experience
express
itself
externally
and
the
foot
most
betrays
it
in
conclusion
it
ought
to
be
kept
in
mind
that
the
hands
of
all
those
people
who
claim
to
be
hard
workers
but
who
really
try
to
live
without
work
thieves
gamblers
ought
to
be
carefully
examined

the

section
the
study
of
the
human
soul
as
psychology
has
for
its
subject
the
whole
stream
of
conscious
life
and
for
its
aim
the
discovery
of
the
occurrence
and
relation
of
the
laws
of
human
thought
now
whether
these
relations
imply
the
coherence
of
the
objects
thought
about
or
not
so
long
as
logic
is
dealing
with
the
laws
according
to
which
thoughts
must
be
correlated
in
order
to
attain
to
objectively
valid
knowledge
all
questions
that
deal
with
the
formal
aspect
of
thinking
do
not
enter
the
field
of
psychological
investigation
the
general
psychological
problem
is
to
describe
the
actual
psychic
events
as
they
occur
to
analyze
them
into
their
simplest
elements
and
inasmuch
as
it
is
this
purely
pragmatic
application
of
psychology
to
the
problem
of
inference
that
concerns
us
we
need
to
deal
only
with
that
law
which
defines
the
combination
of
images
and
with
the
question
how
the
spirit
achieves
this
combination
the
material
aspect
of
this
question
is
therefore
psychological
the
legal
importance
of
the
problem
lies
in
the
very
potent
fact
that
inferences
and
theories
are
often
constructed
which
are
formally
or
logically
absolutely
free
of
error
yet
psychologically
full
of
errors
that
no
logic
whatever
could
correct
we
have
therefore
to
consider
at
least
the
most
important
conditions
which
determine
the
manner
of
our
inferences
the
right
which
lawyers
possess
of
studying
these
questions
so
far
as
they
lie
in
our
field
is
of
modern
establishment
according
to
hillebrand
the
theory
of
knowledge
has
broken
up
into
individual
theories
involving
the
certain
needs
of
special
fields
of
knowledge
the
place
of
the
epistomologists
who
are
professionals
and
beyond
the
pale
of
individual
disciplines
is
now
taken
by
the
representatives
of
those
disciplines
and
each
works
expressly
on
his
own
epistomological
problem
our
especial
problem
is
the
drawing
of
inferences
from
the
material
presented
to
us
or
brought
together
by
our
efforts
just
as
in
other
disciplines
if
we
set
ourselves
the
task
of
determining
the
procedure
when
subjecting
the
fundamental
principles
of
our
work
to
revision
and
examining
their
utility
we
merely
ask
whether
the
process
is
voluntary
or
according
to
fixed
laws
and
having
cleared
up
that
point
we
ask
what
influence
psychological
conditions
exercise
on
the
situation
it
is
indeed
said
that
thinking
is
a
congenital
endowment
not
to
be
learned
from
rules
but
the
problem
is
not
teaching
the
inferrer
to
think
the
problem
is
the
examination
of
how
inferences
have
been
made
by
another
and
what
value
his
inferences
may
have
for
our
own
conclusions
and
our
own
time
which
has
been
bold
enough
to
lay
this
final
conclusion
in
even
the
most
important
criminal
cases
in
the
hands
of
laymen
this
time
is
doubly
bound
at
least
to
prepare
all
possible
control
for
this
work
to
measure
what
is
finally
taken
as
evidence
with
the
finest
instruments
possible
and
to
present
to
the
jury
only
what
has
been
proved
and
repeatedly
examined
it
might
almost
seem
as
if
the
task
the
jury
trial
sets
the
judge
has
not
been
clearly
perceived
a
judge
who
thinks
he
has
performed
it
when
he
has
cast
before
the
jury
the
largest
possible
mass
of
testimony
more
or
less
reviewed
and
who
sees
how
people
who
perhaps
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
are
involved
in
a
court
of
law
who
perhaps
see
a
criminal
for
the
first
time
and
are
under
these
circumstances
the
arbiters
of
a
fate
a
judge
who
sees
all
this
and
is
satisfied
is
not
effective
in
his
work
nowadays
more
than
ever
it
is
for
the
judge
to
test
all
evidence
psychologically
to
review
what
is
only
apparently
clear
to
fill
out
lacunae
and
to
surmount
difficulties
before
he
permits
the
material
brought
together
in
a
very
few
hours
to
pass
into
the
hands
according
to
hillebrand
much
that
seems
shows
itself
dependent
on
definite
experience
attained
in
the
process
of
hundreds
of
repetitions
in
the
daily

what

be
held
for
true
hume
has
already
shown
how
the
most
complex
and
abstract
concepts
are
derived
from
sensation
their
relation
must
be
studied
and
only
when
we
can
account
for
every
psychic
process
with
which
we
have
to
concern
ourselves
is
our
duty
properly
fulfilled

mittermaier

not
only
formally
but
must
sustain
materially
every
possible
test
whether
circumstantial
or
if
for
example
the
fundamental
sources
should
be
a
combination
of
a
judicial
examination
of
premises
lokalaugenschein
testimony
of
witnesses
and
a
partial
confession
the
requirements
of
the
law
would
be
satisfied
if
the
protocol
were
written
or
made
according
to
prescribed
forms
if
a
sufficient
number
of
properly
summoned
witnesses
unanimously
confirmed
the
point
in

and
if
finally
the
confession
were
made
and
protocoled
according

yet
though
the

be
satisfied
not
only
may
the
conclusion
be
wholly
false
but
every
particular
part
of
the
evidence
may
be
perfectly
useless
without
the
presence
anywhere
of
intentional
untruth
the
personal
examination
may
have
been
made
by
a
judge
who
half
the
time
for
some
sufficiently
cogent
reason
had
a
different
conception
of
the
case
than
the
one
which
later
appeared
to
be
true
it
need
not
have
been
necessary
that
there
should
be
mixed
therewith
false
information
of
witnesses
incorrect
observation
or
such
other
mistakes
there
need
only
have
been
a
presupposition
accepted
at
the
beginning
of
the
examination
when
the
examination
of
the
premises
took
place
as
to
the
visible
condition
of
things
and
this
might
have
given
apparent
justification
to
doubtful
material
and
have
rendered
it
intelligible
only
to
be
shown
later
as
false
the
however
is
generally
supposed
to
be
it
is
supposed
to
deal
only
with
circumstantial
events
and
it
does
not
occur
to
anybody
to
modify
and
alter
it
when
it
is
certainly
known
that
at
another
point
the
situation
has
taken
an
altogether
different
form
the
objectivity
of
the
local
examination
is
simply
and
if
it
were
really
objective
contained
merely
dry
description
with
so
and
so
many
notations
of
distances
and
other
figures
it
would
be
of
no
use
every
local
examination
to
be
of
use
must
give
an
accurate
picture
of
the
mental
process
of
him
who
made
it
on
the
one
hand
it
must
bring
vividly
to
the
mind
of
the
reader
even
of
the
sentencing
judge
what
the
situation
was
on
the
other
it
must
demonstrate
what
the
examiner
thought
and
represented
to
himself
in
order
that
the
reader
who
may
have
different
opinions
may
have
a
chance
to
make
corrections
if
i
for
example
get
the
impression
that
a
fire
was
made
through
carelessness
and
that
somebody
lost
his
life
on
account
of
it
and
if
i
made
my
local
examination
with
this
presupposition
in
mind
the
description
will
certainly
seem
different
from
that
made
under
the
knowledge
that
the
fire
was
intentional
and
made
to
kill
at
trial
the
description
of
local
conditions
will
be
read
and
entered
as
important
testimony
it
satisfies
the
law
if
it
is
taken
according
to
form
has
the
correct
content
and
is
read
as
prescribed
but
for
our
conscience
and
in
truth
this
manuscript
can
be
correct
only
when
it
is
logically
and
psychologically
presented
revised
according
to
the
viewpoint
its
writer
would
have
had
if
he
had
been
in
possession
of
all
the
facts
in
possession
of
the
reader
this
work
of
reconstruction
belongs
to
the
most
difficult
of
our
psychological
tasks
but
it
must
be
performed
unless
we
want
to
go
on
superficially
and
without
conscience
the
judgment
and
interpretation
of
the
testimony
of
witnesses
demand
similar
treatment
i
am
legally
right
if
i
base
my
judgment
on
the
testimony
of
witnesses
provided
there
are
enough
of
them
and
they
are
properly
subpoenaed
if
nothing
suggestive
is
offered
against
their
testimony
if
they
do
not
contradict
each
other
and
especially
if
there
are
no
contradictions
in
the
testimony
of
any
single
individual
this
inner
contradiction
is
rather
frequent
and
the
inattention
with
which
the
protocols
as
a
rule
are
read
and
the
scanty
degree
in
which
the
testimony
is
tested
logically
and
psychologically
are
shown
clearly
by
the
fact
that
the
inner
contradictions
are
not
observed
and
worked
over
more
frequently
as
evidence
of
this
let
us
consider
a
few
cases
that
are
generally
told
as
extravagant
jokes
suppose
that
a
man
dreamed
that
his
head
was
cut
off
and
that
that
dream
so
affected
him
that
he
died
of
apoplexy
yet
not
everybody
asks
how
the
dream
was
discovered
in
a
like
manner
people
hear
with
disgust
that
somebody
who
has
lost
his
arm
in
despair
cut
off
his
other
arm
with
an
axe
in
order
more
easily
to
get
assistance
and
yet
they
do
not
ask
or
again
when
somebody
is
asked
if
he
knows
the
romance
emperor
joseph
and
the
beautiful
daughter
the
anachronism
of
the
title
does
not
occur
to
him
and
nobody
thinks
of
the
impossibilities
of
the
vivid
description
of
a
man
walking
back
and
forth
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
reading
a
newspaper
much
testimony
contains
similar
if
not
so
contradictions
if
they
are
credited
in
spite
of
this
fact
the
silly
believer
may
be
blamed
but
he
is
justified
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
if
the
legal
conditions
were
satisfied
hence
the
frightfully
frequent
result
the
deposition
is
true
is
a
matter
for
his
own
conscience
eventually
he
may
be
arrested
for
perjury
but
he
has
made
his
statements
and
i
judge
what
is
intended
with
such
a
statement
is
this
hide
behind
the
law
i
am
permitted
to
judge
in
such
a
case
in
such
a
way
and
nobody
can
blame
but
it
is
correct
to
assert
that
in
such
cases
there
is
really
no
evidence
there
is
only
a
form
of
evidence
it
can
be
actually
evidential
only
when
the
testimony
is
tested
logically
and
psychologically
and
the
ability
and
willingness
of
the
witness
to
tell
the
truth
is
made
clear
of
course
it
is
true
as
mittermaier
says
that
the
utterance
of
witnesses
is
tested
by
its
consistency
with
other
evidence
but
that
is
neither
the
only
test
nor
the
most
valid
for
there
is
always
the
more
important
internal
test
in
the
first
place
and
in
the
second
place
it
is
not
conclusive
because
the
comparison
may
reveal
only
inconsistency
but
can
not
establish
which
of
the
conflicting
statements
is
correct
correctness
can
be
determined
only
through
testing
the
single
statements
the
willingness
and
ability
of
each
witness
both
in
themselves
and
in
relation
to
all
the
presented
material
let
us
take
now
the
third
condition
of
our
suppositions
case
partial
confession
it
is
generally
that
the
value
of
the
latter
is
to
be
judged
according
to
its
own
nature
the
confession
must
be
accepted
as
a
means
of
proof
not
as
proof
and
this
demands
that
it
shall
be
consistent
with
the
rest
of
the
evidence
for
in
that
way
only
can
it
become
proof
but
it
is
most
essential
that
the
confession
shall
be
internally
tested
examined
for
logical
and
psychological
consistency
this
procedure
is
especially
necessary
with
regard
to
certain
definite
confessions
a
confessions
given
without
motive
b
partial
confessions
c
confessions
implying
the
guilt
of
another
a
logic
is
according
to
schiel
the
science
of
evidence
not
of
finding
evidence
but
of
rendering
evidence
evidential
this
is
particularly
true
with
regard
to
confessions
if
we
substitute
psychology
for
logic
it
is
generally
true
that
many
propositions
hold
so
long
only
as
they
are
not
doubted
and
such
is
the
case
with
many
confessions
the
crime
is
confessed
he
who
confesses
to
it
is
always
a
criminal
and
no
man
doubts
it
and
so
the
confession
stands
but
as
soon
as
doubt
justified
or
unjustified
occurs
the
question
takes
quite
a
different
form
the
confession
has
first
served
as
proof
but
now
psychological
examination
alone
will
show
whether
it
can
continue
to
serve
as
proof
the
most
certain
foundation
for
the
truth
of
confession
in
any
case
is
the
establishment
of
a
clear
motive
for
it
and
that
is
rarely
present
of
course
the
motive
is
not
always
absent
because
we
do
not
immediately
recognize
it
but
it
is
not
enough
to
suppose
that
the
confession
does
not
occur
without
a
reason
that
supposition
would
be
approximately
true
but
it
need
not
be
true
if
a
confession
is
to
serve
evidentially
the
motive
must
be
clear
and
indubitable
proof
of
its
mere
existence
is
insufficient
we
must
understand
the
confession
in
terms
of
all
the
factors
that
caused
it
the
process
of
discovering
these
factors
is
purely
logical
and
generally
established
indirectly
by
means
of
an
apagogue
this
is
essentially
the
proof
by
negation
but
it
may
serve
in
connection
with
a
disjunctive
judgment
which
combines
possible
alternatives
as
a
means
of
confirmation
we
are
then
to
bring
together
all
conceivable
motives
and
study
the
confession
with
regard
to
them
if
all
or
most
of
them
are
shown
to
be
impossible
or
insufficient
we
have
left
only
the
judgment
of
one
or
more
conclusions
and
with
this
we
have
an
essentially
psychological
problem
such
a
problem
is
seldom
simple
and
easy
and
as
there
is
no
possibility
of
contradiction
the
danger
is
nowhere
so
great
of
making
light
of
the
matter
is
reasserted
is
half
that
is
a
comfortable
assertion
and
leads
to
considerable
incorrectness
a
confession
is
only
established
in
truth
when
it
is
construed
psychologically
when
the
whole
inner
life
of
the
confessor
and
his
external
conditions
are
brought
into
relation
with
it
and
the
remaining
motives
established
as
at
least
possible
and
this
must
be
done
to
avoid
the
reproach
of
having
condemned
some
confessor
without
evidence
for
a
confession
having
no
motive
may
be
untrue
and
therefore
not
evidential
b
are
difficult
not
only
because
they
make
it
harder
to
prove
the
evidence
for
what
is
not
confessed
but
also
because
what
is
confessed
appears
doubtful
in
the
light
of
what
is
not
even
in
the
simplest
cases
where
the
reason
for
confession
and
silence
seems
to
be
clear
mistakes
are
possible
if
for
example
a
thief
confesses
to
having
stolen
only
what
has
been
found
in
his
possession
but
denies
the
rest
it
is
fairly
probable
that
he
hopes
some
gain
from
the
evidence
in
which
there
appears
to
be
no
proof
of
his
having
stolen
what
has
not
been
found
upon
him
but
though
this
is
generally
the
case
it
might
occur
that
the
thief
wants
to
assume
the
guilt
of
another
person
and
hence
naturally
can
confess
only
to
what
he
is
accused
of
inasmuch
as
he
either
has
insufficient
or
no
evidence
whatever
of
his
guilt
for
the
rest
of
the
crime
another
fairly
clear
reason
for
partial
confession
is
shown
in
the
confession
to
a
certain
degree
of
malicious
intent
as
the
denial
of
the
intent
to
kill
if
this
is
made
by
a
person
who
may
be
supposed
to
know
the
legal
situation
either
because
of
earlier
experience
or
for
other
reasons
there
is
sufficient
justification
for
doubting
the
honesty
of
his
confession
most
of
such
cases
belong
to
the
numerous
class
in
which
the
defendant
confesses
to
a
series
of
facts
or
a
number
of
things
and
denies
a
few
of
them
without
any
apparent
reason
he
may
confess
to
a
dozen
objects
used
in
an
assault
and
simply
refuse
to
discuss
two
probably
quite
insignificant
ones
if
such
a
case
comes
up
for
judgment
to
the
full
bench
half
the
judges
say
that
since
he
has
stolen
twelve
he
must
have
taken
the
other
two
and
the
other
half
say
that
since
he
has
confessed
to
twelve
he
would
have
confessed
to
the
other
two
if
he
had
taken
them
generally
speaking
both
sides
are
right
one
inference
is
as
justified
as
the
other
as
a
rule
such
cases
do
not
repay
a
great
deal
of
troublesome
examination
inasmuch
as
the
question
of
having
stolen
twelve
or
fourteen
objects
can
little
affect
either
his
guilt
or
his
sentence
but
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
it
is
never
indifferent
whether
a
man
pleads
guilty
or
not
guilty
and
later
on
especially
in
another
case
it
may
be
quite
the
reverse
of
indifferent
whether
a
man
is
condemned
because
of
a
matter
indifferent
suppose
that
the
denied
theft
was
of
a
worthless
but
characteristic
thing
an
old
if
now
the
thief
is
again
suspected
of
a
robbery
which
he
denies
and
the
theft
is
again
that
of
an
old
then
it
is
not
indifferent
as
a
matter
of
proof
whether
the
man
was
condemned
for
stealing
a
or
not
if
he
was
so
condemned
there
will
already
be
remarks
about
certain
passion
for
old
and
the
man
will
be
suspected
of
the
second
theft
in
regard
to
the
possession
of
stolen
goods
such
a
sentence
may
have
similar
significance
i
recall
a
case
in
which
several
people
were
sentenced
for
the
theft
of
a
fokos
a
hungarian
cane
with
a
head
like
an
ax
later
a
fokos
was
used
in
murder
in
the
same
region
and
the
first
suspicion
of
the
crime
was
attached
to
the
thief
who
might
because
of
his
early
crime
have
been
in
possession
of
a
fokos
now
suppose
that
the
man
had
confessed
to
theft
of
everything
but
the
fokos
and
that
he
had
been
condemned
on
the
basis
of
the
confession
the
fact
would
be
of
significance
in
the
present
case
of
course
it
is
not
intended
that
the
old
case
is
to
be
tried
again
before
the
new
that
would
be
a
difficult
job
after
the
lapse
of
some
time
and
in
addition
would
be
of
little
use
for
everybody
recalls
the
old
judgment
anyway
and
supposes
that
the
circumstances
must
have
been
such
as
to
show
the
man
guilty
if
a
man
is
once
sentenced
for
something
he
has
not
confessed
to
the
stigma
remains
no
matter
how
the
facts
may
be
against
it
experience
has
shown
that
the
victims
of
theft
count
everything
stolen
that
they
do
not
discover
at
the
first
glance
and
it
might
have
been
lost
long
before
the
theft
or
have
been
stolen
at
an
earlier
or
a
later
time
for
this
reason
it
often
happens
that
servants
and
even
the
children
of
the
house
or
other
frequenters
take
the
robbery
as
an
opportunity
for
explaining
the
disappearance
of
things
they
are
responsible
for
or
steal
afresh
and
blame
it
upon
the
quantity
stolen
is
generally
exaggerated
moreover
in
order
to
excite
universal
sympathy
and
perhaps
to
invoke
help
in
general
we
must
hold
that
there
is
no
psychological
reason
that
a
confessor
should
deny
anything
the
confession
of
which
can
bring
him
no
additional
harm
the
last
point
must
be
carefully
treated
for
it
requires
taking
the
attitude
of
the
accused
and
not
of
the
examiner
it
is
the
information
and
that
must
be
studied
and
it
often
contains
the
most
perverted
one
man
denies
out
of
mere
obstinacy
because
he
believes
that
his
guilt
is
increased
by
this
or
that
fact
the
proposition
who
has
stolen
one
thing
has
also
stolen
the
rest
has
slight
justification
c
if
a
denying
is
accused
by
a
confession
the
interpretation
of
the
latter
becomes
difficult
first
of
all
the
pure
kernel
of
the
confession
must
be
brought
to
light
and
everything
set
aside
that
might
serve
to
free
the
confessor
and
involve
the
other
in
guilt
this
portion
of
the
work
is
comparatively
the
easiest
inasmuch
as
it
depends
upon
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
it
is
more
difficult
to
determine
what
degree
of
crime
the
confessor
attached
to
himself
by
accusing
also
the
other
man
because
clearness
can
be
reached
in
such
a
case
only
by
working
out
the
situation
from
beginning
to
end
in
two
directions
first
by
studying
it
without
reference
to
the
second
with
such
reference
the
complete
elimination
of
the
additional
circumstance
is
exceedingly
troublesome
because
it
requires
the
complete
control
of
the
material
and
because
it
is
always
psychologically
difficult
so
to
exclude
an
event
already
known
in
its
development
and
inference
as
to
be
able
to
formulate
a
theory
quite
without
reference
to
it
if
this
is
really
accomplished
and
some
positive
fact
is
established
in
the
the
question
becomes
one
of
finding
the
value
seen
by
the
confessor
in
blaming
himself
together
with
his
fellow
revenge
hatred
jealousy
envy
anger
suspicion
and
other
passions
will
be
the
forces
in
which
this
value
will
be
found
one
man
brings
his
ancient
comrade
into
jeopardy
in
revenge
for
the
injustice
in
the
division
of
the
booty
or
in
deliberate
anger
at
the
commission
of
some
dangerous
stupidity
in
a
burglary
again
it
often
happens
that
he
or
she
through
jealousy
accuses
her
or
him
in
order
that
the
other
may
be
also
imprisoned
and
so
not
become
disloyal
business
jealousy
again
is
as
influential
as
the
attempt
to
prevent
another
from
disposing
of
some
hidden
booty
or
from
carrying
out
by
himself
some
robbery
planned
in
partnership
these
motives
are
not
always
easy
to
discover
but
are
conceivable
there
are
also
cases
not
at
all
rare
in
which
the
ordinary
man
is
fully
lacking
in
comprehension
of
substitute
value
which
makes
him
confess
the
complicity
of
his
fellow
i
am
going
to
offer
just
one
example
and
inasmuch
as
the
persons
concerned
are
long
since
dead
will
by
way
of
exception
mention
their
names
and
the
improbability
of
their
stories
in
an
old
man
blasius
kern
was
found
one
morning
completely
snowed
over
and
with
a
serious
wound
in
the
head
there
was
no
possible
suspicion
of
robbery
as
motive
of
the
murder
inasmuch
as
the
man
was
on
his
way
home
drunk
as
usual
and
it
was
supposed
that
he
had
fallen
down
and
had
smashed
his
skull
in
a
young
fellow
peter
seyfried
came
to
court
and
announced
that
he
had
been
hired
by
blasius
daughter
julia
hauck
and
her
husband
august
hauck
to
kill
the
old
fellow
who
had
become
unendurable
through
his
love
of
drink
and
his
endless
quarrelsomeness
and
accordingly
he
had
done
the
deed
he
had
been
promised
an
old
pair
of
trousers
and
three
gulden
but
they
had
given
him
the
trousers
not
the
money
and
as
all
his
attempts
to
collect
payment
had
failed
he
divulged
the
secret
of
the
hauck
people
when
i
asked
him
if
he
were
unaware
that
he
himself
was
subject
to
the
law
he
said
care
the
others
at
least
will
also
be
punished
why
they
kept
their
and
this
lad
was
very
stupid
and
microcephalic
but
according
to
opinion
capable
of
distinguishing
between
right
and
wrong
his
statements
proved
themselves
true
to
the
very
last
point
so
significantly
weak
as
this
in
fundamental
reliability
very
few
confessions
will
appear
to
be
but
the
reasons
for
confessions
difficult
both
to
find
and
to
judge
are
many
indeed
the
only
way
to
attain
certainty
is
through
complete
and
knowledge
of
all
the
external
conditions
but
primarily
through
sound
psychological
insight
into
the
nature
of
both
the
confessor
and
those
he
accuses
evidently
the
first
is
by
far
the
more
important
what
he
is
beneath
the
surface
his
capacities
passions
intentions
and
purposes
must
all
be
settled
if
any
decision
is
to
be
arrived
at
as
to
the
advantage
accruing
to
a
man
by
the
accusation
of
others
for
example
the
passionate
character
of
some
persons
may
indicate
beyond
a
doubt
that
they
might
find
pleasure
in
suffering
provided
they
could
cause
suffering
to
others
at
that
price
passion
is
almost
always
what
impels
men
and
what
passion
in
particular
lies
behind
a
confession
will
be
revealed
partly
by
the
crime
partly
by
the
relation
of
the
criminals
one
to
the
other
partly
by
the
personality
of
the
new
victim
if
this
passion
was
strong
enough
to
deal
if
i
may
use
the
term
it
can
be
discovered
only
through
the
study
of
its
possessor
it
may
be
presupposed
that
everybody
acts
according
to
his
own
advantage
the
question
asks
merely
what
this
advantage
is
in
the
concrete
and
whether
he
who
seeks
it
seeks
it
prudently
even
the
satisfaction
of
revenge
may
be
felt
as
an
advantage
if
it
is
more
pleasurable
than
the
pain
which
follows
confession
the
matter
is
one
of
relative
weight
and
is
prudently
sought
as
the
substitution
of
an
immediate
and
petty
advantage
for
a
later
and
greater
one
another
series
of
procedures
is
of
importance
in
determining
proof
where
circumstances
are
denied
which
have
no
essential
relation
to
the
crime
they
bring
the
presentation
of
proof
into
a
bypath
so
that
the
essential
problem
of
evidence
is
left
behind
then
if
the
denied
circumstance
is
established
as
a
fact
it
is
falsely
supposed
that
the
guilt
is
so
established
and
in
this
direction
many
mistakes
are
frequently
made
there
are
two
suggestive
examples
some
years
ago
there
lived
in
vienna
a
very
pretty
bachelor
girl
a
in
a
very
respectable
shop
one
day
she
was
found
dead
in
her
room
inasmuch
as
the
judicial
investigation
showed
acute
arsenic
poisoning
and
as
a
tumbler
half
full
of
sweetened
water
and
a
considerable
quantity
of
finely
powdered
arsenic
was
found
on
her
table
these
two
conditions
were
naturally
correlated
from
the
neighbors
it
was
learned
that
the
dead
girl
had
for
some
time
been
intimate
with
an
unknown
gentleman
who
visited
her
frequently
but
whose
presence
was
kept
as
secret
as
possible
by
both
this
gentleman
it
was
said
had
called
on
the
girl
on
the
evening
before
her
death
the
police
inferred
that
the
man
was
a
very
rich
merchant
residing
in
a
rather
distant
region
who
lived
peaceably
with
his
much
older
wife
and
therefore
kept
his
illicit
relations
with
the
girl
secret
it
was
further
established
at
the
autopsy
that
the
girl
was
pregnant
and
so
the
theory
was
formed
that
the
merchant
had
poisoned
his
mistress
and
in
the
examination
this
deed
was
set
down
against
him
now
if
the
man
had
immediately
confessed
that
he
knew
the
dead
girl
and
stood
in
intimate
relation
with
her
and
that
he
had
called
on
her
the
last
evening
if
he
had
asserted
perhaps
that
she
was
in
despair
about
her
condition
had
quarreled
with
him
and
had
spoken
of
suicide
then
suicide
would
unconditionally
have
had
to
be
the
verdict
in
any
event
he
never
could
have
been
accused
inasmuch
as
there
was
no
additional
evidence
of
poisoning
but
the
man
conceived
the
unfortunate
notion
of
denying
that
he
knew
the
dead
girl
or
had
any
relations
with
her
or
that
he
had
ever
even
on
that
last
evening
called
on
her
he
did
this
clearly
because
he
did
not
want
to
confess
a
culpable
relation
to
public
opinion
especially
to
his
wife
and
the
whole
question
turned
upon
this
denied
circumstance
the
problem
of
evidence
was
no
longer
he
killed
her
but
he
carry
on
an
intimacy
with
then
it
was
proved
beyond
reasonable
doubt
through
a
long
series
of
witnesses
that
his
visits
to
the
girl
were
frequent
that
he
had
been
there
on
the
evening
before
her
death
and
that
there
could
be
no
possible
doubt
as
to
his
identity
that
settled
his
fate
and
he
was
sentenced
to
death
if
we
consider
the
case
psychologically
we
have
to
grant
that
his
denial
of
having
been
present
might
have
for
motive
as
much
the
fact
that
he
had
poisoned
the
girl
as
that
he
did
not
want
to
admit
the
relation
at
the
beginning
later
on
when
he
completely
understood
the
seriousness
of
his
situation
he
thought
a
change
of
front
too
daring
and
hoped
to
get
on
better
by
sticking
to
his
story
now
as
we
have
seen
what
was
proved
was
the
fact
that
he
knew
and
visited
the
girl
what
he
was
sentenced
for
was
the
murder
of
the
girl
a
similar
case
particularly
instructive
in
its
development
and
especially
interesting
because
of
the
significant
study
of
the
suggestibility
of
witnesses
of
dr
von
and
grashey
kept
the
whole
of
munich
in
excitement
some
years
ago
a
widow
her
daughter
and
an
old
servant
were
stifled
and
robbed
in
their
home
the
suspicion
of
the
crime
fell
upon
a
who
had
once
before
made
a
confession
concerning
another
murder
and
of
whom
it
was
known
that
some
time
before
the
deed
was
done
he
had
been
building
a
closet
into
the
house
of
the
three
murdered
women
through
various
combinations
of
the
facts
the
supposition
was
reached
that
the
mason
got
entry
into
the
house
on
the
pretense
of
examining
whether
or
not
the
work
he
had
done
on
the
closet
had
caused
any
damage
and
had
then
committed
the
thieving
murder
now
here
again
if
the
mason
had
said
i
was
without
a
job
wanted
to
get
work
entered
the
house
under
the
assigned
pretense
and
appeared
to
see
about
the
closet
and
had
myself
paid
for
the
apparently
repaired
improvement
left
the
three
women
unharmed
and
they
must
only
after
that
have
been
killed
if
he
had
said
this
his
condemnation
would
have
been
impossible
for
all
the
other
testimony
was
of
subordinate
importance
now
suppose
the
man
was
innocent
what
could
he
have
thought
have
already
been
examined
once
in
a
murder
case
i
found
myself
in
financial
difficulties
i
still
am
in
such
difficulties
if
i
admit
that
i
was
at
the
place
of
the
crime
at
the
time
the
crime
was
committed
i
will
get
into
serious
trouble
which
i
if
i
deny
my
so
he
really
denied
having
been
in
the
house
or
in
the
street
for
some
time
and
inasmuch
as
this
was
shown
by
many
witnesses
to
be
untrue
his
presence
at
the
place
where
the
crime
was
committed
was
identified
with
the
unproved
fact
that
he
had
committed
it
and
he
was
condemned
i
do
not
assert
that
either
one
or
the
other
of
these
persons
was
condemned
guiltlessly
or
that
such
have
no
value
and
ought
not
to
be
proved
i
merely
point
out
that
caution
is
necessary
in
two
directions
first
of
all
these
side
issues
must
not
be
identified
with
the
central
issue
their
demonstration
is
only
preparatory
work
the
value
of
which
must
be
established
cautiously
and
without
prejudice
it
may
be
said
that
the
feeling
of
satisfaction
with
what
has
been
done
causes
jurists
frequently
to
forget
what
must
yet
be
done
or
to
undervalue
it
further
a
psychological
examination
must
seek
out
the
motives
which
led
or
might
have
led
the
accused
to
deny
some
point
not
particularly
dangerous
to
him
in
most
cases
an
intelligible
ground
for
such
action
can
be
discovered
and
if
the
psychologically
prior
conditions
are
conceived
with
sufficient
narrowness
to
keep
us
from
assuming
unconditional
guilt
we
are
at
least
called
upon
to
be
careful
this
curious
danger
of
identification
of
different
issues
as
the
aim
of
presentation
of
evidence
occurs
much
more
frequently
and
with
comparatively
greater
degree
in
the
cases
of
individual
witnesses
who
are
convinced
of
the
principal
issue
when
a
side
issue
is
proved
suppose
a
witness
is
called
on
to
identify
a
man
as
somebody
who
had
stabbed
him
in
a
serious
assault
and
that
he
has
also
to
explain
whether
the
quarrel
he
had
had
with
this
man
a
short
time
ago
was
of
importance
if
the
suspect
is
desirous
of
having
the
quarrel
appear
as
harmless
and
the
wounded
person
asserts
that
the
quarrel
was
serious
the
latter
will
be
convinced
the
moment
his
contention
may
be
viewed
as
true
that
his
opponent
was
really
the
person
who
had
stabbed
him
there
is
of
course
a
certain
logical
justification
for
this
supposition
but
the
psychological
difficulty
with
it
is
the
fact
that
this
case
like
many
others
involves
the
identification
of
what
is
inferred
with
what
is
perceived
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
mere
fact
of
arrest
is
to
most
people
a
conviction
of
guilt
the
witness
who
had
first
identified
a
as
only
the
probable
criminal
becomes
absolutely
convinced
of
it
when
a
is
presented
to
him
in
stripes
even
though
he
knows
that
a
has
been
arrested
on
his
own
testimony
alone
the
appearance
and
the
surroundings
of
the
prisoner
influence
many
and
not
merely
uneducated
people
against
the
prisoner
and
they
think
involuntarily
he
were
not
the
one
they
would
not
have
him
section
b
causation
if
we
understand
by
the
term
cause
the
axiom
that
every
change
has
an
occasion
hence
that
every
event
is
bound
up
with
a
number
of
conditions
which
when
lacking
in
whole
or
in
part
would
prevent
the
appearance
of
the
event
while
their
presence
would
compel
its
appearance
then
the
whole
business
of
the
criminalist
is
the
study
of
causes
he
must
indeed
study
not
only
whether
and
how
crime
and
criminal
are
causally
related
but
also
how
their
individual
elements
are
bound
to
each
other
and
to
the
criminal
and
finally
what
causation
in
the
criminal
considered
with
regard
to
his
individual
characteristics
inevitably
led
to
the
commission
of
the
crime
the
fact
that
we
deal
with
the
problem
of
cause
brings
us
close
to
other
sciences
which
have
the
same
task
in
their
own
researches
and
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
necessary
concern
with
other
disciplines
of
course
no
earnest
criminalist
can
pursue
other
studies
for
their
own
sake
he
has
no
time
but
he
must
look
about
him
and
study
the
methods
used
in
other
sciences
in
the
other
sciences
we
learn
method
but
not
as
method
and
that
is
all
that
we
need
and
we
observe
that
the
whole
problem
of
method
is
grounded
on
causation
whether
empirically
or
aprioristically
does
not
matter
we
are
concerned
solely
with
causation
in
certain
directions
our
task
is
next
to
the
who
aim
to
bring
men
and
events
into
definite
causal
sequence
the
causal
law
is
indubitably
the
ideal
and
only
instructive
instrument
in
the
task
of
writing
convincing
history
and
it
is
likewise
without
question
that
the
same
method
is
specifically
required
in
the
presentation
of
evidence
thus
is
the
causal
chain
of
which
the
last
link
is
the
crime
committed
by
a
now
i
present
the
fact
of
the
crime
and
include
only
those
events
which
may
be
exclusively
bound
up
with
criminality
and
the
crime
appears
as
committed
now
again
i
present
the
fact
of
the
crime
and
exclude
all
those
events
which
can
without
exception
be
included
only
if
a
is
not
a
criminal
and
there
is
no
evidently
the
finding
of
causes
involves
according
to
the
complexities
of
the
case
a
varying
number
of
subordinate
tasks
which
have
to
be
accomplished
for
each
particular
incident
inasmuch
as
each
suspicion
each
statement
or
has
to
be
tested
the
job
is
a
big
one
but
it
is
the
only
way
to
absolute
and
certain
success
provided
there
is
no
mistake
in
the
work
of
correlating
events
as
schell
says
all
the
observed
identities
of
effect
in
natural
phenomena
only
one
has
the
complete
strength
of
mathematical
law
the
general
law
of
causation
the
fact
that
everything
that
has
a
beginning
has
a
cause
is
as
old
as
human
the
application
of
this
proposition
to
our
own
problem
shows
that
we
are
not
to
turn
the
issue
in
any
unnecessary
direction
once
we
are
convinced
that
every
phenomenon
has
its
occasion
we
are
on
the
contrary
to
demonstrate
this
occasion
and
to
bring
it
into
connection
with
every
problem
set
by
the
testimony
at
any
moment
in
most
cases
the
task
though
not
rigidly
divided
is
double
and
its
quality
depends
upon
the
question
whether
the
criminal
was
known
from
the
beginning
or
not
the
duality
is
foremost
and
lasts
longest
if
only
the
deed
itself
is
known
and
if
the
judge
must
limit
himself
entirely
to
its
sole
study
in
order
to
derive
from
it
its
objective
situation
the
greatest
mistakes
in
a
trial
occur
when
this
derivation
of
the
objective
situation
of
the
crime
is
made
unintelligently
hastily
or
carelessly
and
conversely
the
greatest
successes
are
due
to
its
correct
rendering
but
such
a
correct
rendering
is
no
more
than
the
use
of
the
principle
of
causality
suppose
a
great
crime
has
been
committed
and
the
personality
of
the
criminal
is
not
revealed
by
the
character
of
the
crime
the
mistake
regularly
made
in
such
a
case
is
the
immediate
and
superficial
search
for
the
personality
of
the
criminal
instead
of
what
should
properly
proceed
the
study
of
the
causal
conditions
of
the
crime
for
the
causal
law
does
not
say
that
everything
which
occurs
taken
as
a
whole
and
in
its
elements
has
one
ground
that
would
be
simply
categorical
emptiness
what
is
really
required
is
an
efficient
and
satisfying
cause
and
this
is
required
not
merely
for
the
deed
as
a
whole
but
for
every
single
detail
when
causes
are
found
for
all
of
these
they
must
be
brought
together
and
correlated
with
the
crime
as
described
and
then
integrated
with
the
whole
series
of
events
the
second
part
of
the
work
turns
upon
the
suspicion
of
a
definite
person
when
his
own
activity
is
interpolated
as
a
cause
of
the
crime
under
some
conditions
again
the
effect
of
the
crime
on
the
criminal
has
to
be
examined
enrichment
deformation
emotional
state
etc
but
the
evidence
of
guilt
is
established
only
when
the
crime
is
accurately
and
explicitly
described
as
the
inevitable
result
of
the
activity
of
the
criminal
and
his
activity
only
this
systematic
work
of
observing
and
correlating
every
instant
of
the
supposed
activities
of
the
accused
once
the
situation
of
the
crime
is
defined
as
certainly
as
possible
is
as
instructive
as
it
is
promising
of
success
it
is
the
one
activity
which
brings
us
into
touch
with
bare
perception
and
its
reproduction
inference
with
regard
to
facts
appears
to
depend
upon
the
relation
of
cause
to
effect
by
virtue
of
this
relation
alone
may
we
rely
upon
the
evidence
of
our
memories
and
our
hume
illustrates
this
remark
with
the
following
example
if
a
clock
or
some
other
machine
is
found
on
a
desert
island
the
conclusion
is
drawn
that
men
are
or
were
on
the
island
the
application
is
easy
enough
the
presence
of
a
clock
the
presence
of
a
wound
is
perceived
by
the
senses
that
men
were
there
that
the
wound
was
made
with
a
specific
kind
of
instrument
is
a
causal
inference
simple
as
this
proposition
of
is
it
is
of
utmost
importance
in
the
law
because
of
the
permanent
and
continually
renewed
problems
what
is
the
effect
in
case
what
is
the
cause
do
they
belong
together
remembering
that
these
questions
make
our
greatest
tasks
and
putting
them
even
beyond
the
limit
of
disgust
will
save
us
from
grave
errors
there
is
another
important
condition
to
which
hume
calls
attention
and
which
is
interpreted
by
his
clever
disciple
meinong
it
is
a
fact
that
without
the
help
of
previous
experience
no
causal
nexus
can
be
referred
to
an
observation
nor
can
the
presence
of
such
be
discovered
in
individual
instances
it
may
be
postulated
only
a
cause
is
essentially
a
complex
in
which
every
element
is
of
identical
value
and
this
circumstance
is
more
complicated
than
it
appears
to
be
inasmuch
as
it
requires
reflection
to
distinguish
whether
only
one
or
more
observations
have
been
made
strict
alone
and
accurate
enumeration
and
supervision
will
lead
to
a
correct
decision
as
to
whether
one
or
ten
observations
have
been
made
or
whether
the
notion
of
additional
observations
is
not
altogether
illusory
this
task
involves
a
number
of
important
circumstances
first
of
all
must
be
considered
the
manner
in
which
the
man
on
the
street
conceives
the
causal
relation
between
different
objects
the
notion
of
causality
as
schwarz
shows
is
essentially
foreign
to
the
man
on
the
street
he
is
led
mainly
by
the
analogy
of
natural
causality
with
that
of
human
activity
and
passivity
the
fire
is
active
with
regard
to
water
which
simply
must
sizzle
passively
this
observation
is
indubitably
correct
and
significant
but
i
think
schwarz
wrong
to
have
limited
his
description
to
ordinary
people
it
is
true
also
of
very
complex
natures
it
is
conceivable
that
external
phenomena
shall
be
judged
in
analogy
with
the
self
and
inasmuch
as
the
latter
often
appears
to
be
purely
active
it
is
also
supposed
that
those
natural
phenomena
which
appear
to
be
especially
active
are
really
so
in
addition
many
objects
in
the
external
world
with
which
we
have
a
good
deal
to
do
and
are
hence
important
do
as
a
matter
of
fact
really
appear
to
be
active
the
sun
light
warmth
cold
the
weather
so
that
we
assign
activity
and
passivity
only
according
to
the
values
the
objects
have
for
us
the
ensuing
mistake
is
the
fact
that
we
overlook
the
alternations
between
activity
and
passivity
or
simply
do
not
make
the
study
such
alternations
require
yet
the
correct
apportionment
of
action
and
reaction
is
for
us
of
greatest
importance
in
this
regard
moreover
there
is
always
the
empty
problem
as
to
whether
two
things
may
stand
in
causal
relation
empty
because
the
answer
is
always
yes
the
scientific
and
practical
problem
is
as
to
whether
there
exists
an
actual
causal
nexus
the
same
relation
occurs
in
the
problem
of
reciprocal
influences
no
one
will
say
for
example
that
any
event
exercises
a
reciprocal
influence
on
the
sun
but
apart
from
such
relatively
few
cases
it
would
not
only
be
supposed
that
a
is
the
cause
of
the
effect
b
but
also
that
b
might
have
reciprocally
influenced
a
regard
for
this
possibility
may
save
one
from
many
mistakes
one
important
source
of
error
with
regard
to
cause
and
effect
lies
in
the
general
and
profound
supposition
that
the
cause
must
have
a
certain
similarity
to
the
effect
so
ovid
according
to
mill
has
medea
brew
a
broth
of
animals
and
popular
superstitions
are
full
of
such
doctrine
the
lung
of
a
fox
is
used
as
a
cure
for
asthma
the
yarrow
is
used
to
cure
jaundice
agaricos
is
used
for
blisters
aristolochia
the
fruit
of
which
has
the
form
of
a
uterus
is
used
for
the
pains
of
and
for
this
series
may
be
voluntarily
increased
when
related
to
the
holy
patron
saints
of
the
catholic
church
who
are
chosen
as
protectors
against
some
especial
condition
or
some
specific
difficulty
because
they
at
one
time
had
some
connection
with
that
particular
matter
so
the
holy
odilia
is
the
patron
saint
for
diseases
of
the
eye
not
because
she
knew
how
to
cure
the
eyes
but
because
her
eyes
were
put
out
with
needles
the
thief
dismas
is
the
patron
of
the
dying
because
we
know
nothing
about
him
save
that
he
died
with
christ
barbara
who
is
pictured
together
with
a
tower
in
which
she
was
imprisoned
and
which
was
supposed
to
be
a
powder
house
has
become
the
patron
saint
of
artillery
in
the
same
manner
nicholas
is
according
to
simrock
the
patron
of
sailors
because
his
name
resembles
nichus
nicor
nicker
which
is
the
name
of
the
unforgotten
old
german
against
such
combinations
external
and
unjustified
not
even
the
most
educated
and
skilful
is
safe
nobody
will
doubt
that
he
is
required
to
make
considerable
effort
in
his
causal
interpretation
because
of
the
influence
of
such
similarities
the
matter
would
not
be
so
dangerous
all
in
all
because
such
mistakes
may
be
easily
corrected
and
the
attention
of
people
may
be
called
to
the
inadequacy
of
such
causation
but
the
reason
for
this
kind
of
correlations
is
rarely
discovered
either
people
do
not
want
to
tell
it
because
they
instinctively
perceive
that
their
causal
interpretation
can
not
be
justified
or
they
can
not
even
express
it
because
the
causal
relation
had
been
assumed
only
subconsciously
and
they
are
hence
unaware
of
the
reasons
for
it
and
all
the
more
convinced
that
they
are
right
so
for
example
an
intelligent
man
told
me
that
he
suspected
another
of
a
murder
because
the
mother
died
a
violent
death
the
witness
stuck
to
his
statement
man
who
had
once
had
something
to
do
with
killing
must
have
had
something
to
do
with
this
in
a
similar
manner
a
whole
village
accused
a
man
of
arson
because
he
was
born
on
the
night
on
which
a
neighboring
village
burned
down
here
however
there
was
no
additional
argument
in
the
belief
that
his
mother
had
absorbed
the
influence
of
the
fire
inasmuch
as
the
latter
was
told
that
there
had
been
a
fire
only
after
the
child
was
born
once
had
something
to
do
with
fire
was
the
basis
of
the
judgment
also
in
this
case
there
are
innumerable
similar
examples
which
with
a
large
number
of
habitual
superstitious
presuppositions
make
only
false
causality
pearls
mean
tears
because
they
have
similar
form
inasmuch
as
the
cuckoo
may
not
without
a
purpose
have
only
two
calls
at
one
time
and
ten
or
twenty
at
another
the
calls
must
mean
the
number
of
years
before
death
before
marriage
or
of
a
certain
amount
of
money
or
any
other
countable
thing
such
notions
are
so
firmly
rooted
in
the
peasantry
and
in
all
of
us
that
they
come
to
the
surface
whether
consciously
or
unconsciously
and
influence
us
more
than
we
are
accustomed
to
suppose
they
do
whenever
anybody
assures
us
that
he
is
able
to
assert
absolutely
though
not
altogether
prove
a
thing
this
assurance
may
be
variously
grounded
but
not
rarely
it
is
no
more
than
one
of
these
false
correlations
schopenhauer
has
said
that
is
causality
seen
from
within
and
one
may
add
conversely
that
causality
is
motivation
seen
from
without
what
is
asserted
must
be
motivated
and
that
is
done
by
means
of
causality
if
no
real
ultimate
cause
is
found
a
false
superficial
and
insufficient
one
is
adopted
inasmuch
as
we
ever
strive
to
relate
things
causally
in
the
knowledge
that
otherwise
the
world
would
be
says
stricker
learn
that
men
who
do
not
associate
their
experiences
according
to
right
cause
are
badly
adapted
to
their
environment
the
pictures
of
artists
are
disliked
the
work
does
not
succeed
the
tradesman
loses
his
money
and
the
general
his
and
we
may
add
criminalist
his
for
whoever
seeks
the
reason
for
a
lost
case
certainly
will
find
it
in
the
ignorance
of
the
real
fact
and
in
the
incorrect
co√∂rdination
of
cause
and
effect
the
most
difficult
thing
in
such
co√∂rdination
is
not
that
it
has
to
be
tested
according
to
the
notion
one
has
for
himself
of
the
chain
of
events
the
difficulty
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
point
of
view
and
mental
habits
of
the
man
who
is
suspected
of
the
effects
must
be
adopted
without
this
the
causal
relations
as
they
are
arrived
at
by
the
other
can
never
be
reached
or
different
results
most
likely
ensue
the
frequency
of
mistakes
like
those
just
mentioned
is
well
known
they
affect
history
even
la
rochefoucauld
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
great
and
splendid
deeds
which
are
presented
by
statesmen
as
the
outcome
of
plans
are
as
a
rule
merely
the
result
of
inclination
and
passion
this
opinion
concerns
the
task
also
for
the
lawyer
is
almost
always
trying
to
discover
the
moving
great
and
unified
plan
of
each
crime
and
in
order
to
sustain
such
a
notion
prefers
to
perfect
a
large
and
difficult
theoretic
construction
rather
than
to
suppose
that
there
never
was
a
plan
but
that
the
whole
crime
sprang
from
accident
inclination
and
sudden
impulse
the
easiest
victims
in
this
respect
are
the
most
logical
and
systematic
lawyers
they
merely
presuppose
would
not
have
done
and
forget
that
the
criminal
was
not
at
all
so
logical
and
systematic
that
he
did
not
even
work
according
to
plan
but
simply
followed
straying
impulses
moreover
a
man
may
have
determined
his
causal
connections
correctly
yet
have
omitted
many
things
or
finally
have
made
a
voluntary
stop
at
some
point
in
his
work
or
may
have
carried
the
causal
chain
unnecessarily
far
this
possibility
has
been
made
especially
clear
by
mill
who
showed
that
the
immediately
preceding
condition
is
never
taken
as
cause
when
we
throw
a
stone
into
the
water
we
call
the
cause
of
its
sinking
its
gravity
and
not
the
fact
that
it
has
been
thrown
into
the
water
so
again
when
a
man
falls
down
stairs
and
breaks
his
foot
in
the
story
of
the
fall
the
law
of
gravity
is
not
mentioned
it
is
taken
for
granted
when
the
matter
is
not
so
clear
as
in
the
preceding
examples
such
facts
are
often
the
cause
of
important
misunderstandings
in
the
first
case
where
the
immediately
preceding
condition
is
mentioned
it
is
the
inaccuracy
of
the
expression
that
is
at
fault
for
we
see
that
at
least
in
scientific
form
the
efficient
cause
is
always
the
immediately
preceding
condition
so
the
physician
says
cause
of
death
was
congestion
of
the
brain
in
consequence
of
pressure
resulting
from
extravasation
of
the
and
he
indicates
only
in
the
second
line
that
the
latter
event
resulted
from
a
blow
on
the
head
in
a
similar
manner
the
physicist
says
that
the
board
was
sprung
as
a
consequence
of
the
uneven
tension
of
the
fibers
he
adds
only
later
that
this
resulted
from
the
warmth
which
again
is
the
consequence
of
the
direct
sunlight
that
fell
on
the
board
now
the
layman
had
in
both
cases
omitted
the
proximate
causes
and
would
have
said
in
case
man
died
because
he
was
beaten
on
the
head
and
in
case
board
was
sprung
because
it
lay
in
the
we
have
therefore
to
agree
to
the
surprising
fact
that
the
layman
skips
more
intermediaries
than
the
professional
but
only
because
either
he
is
ignorant
of
or
ignores
the
intervening
conditions
hence
he
is
also
in
greater
danger
of
making
a
mistake
through
omission
inasmuch
as
the
question
deals
only
with
the
scarcity
of
correct
knowledge
of
proximate
causes
we
shall
set
aside
the
fact
that
lawyers
themselves
make
such
mistakes
which
may
be
avoided
only
by
careful
and
cautious
attention
to
own
thoughts
but
we
have
at
the
same
time
to
recognize
how
important
the
matter
is
when
we
receive
long
series
of
inferences
from
witnesses
who
give
expression
only
to
the
first
and
the
last
deduction
if
we
do
not
then
examine
and
investigate
the
intermediary
links
and
their
justification
we
deserve
to
hear
extravagant
things
and
what
is
worse
to
make
them
as
we
do
the
foundation
of
further
inference
and
once
this
is
done
no
man
can
discover
where
the
mistake
lies
if
again
an
inference
is
omitted
as
cf
the
case
of
gravity
in
falling
down
stairs
the
source
of
error
and
the
difficulty
lies
in
the
fact
that
on
the
one
hand
not
everything
is
as
as
it
seems
on
the
other
that
two
people
rarely
understand
the
same
thing
by
so
that
what
is
to
one
is
far
from
so
to
the
other
this
difference
becomes
especially
clear
when
a
lawyer
examines
professional
people
who
can
imagine
offhand
what
is
in
no
sense
to
persons
in
other
walks
of
life
i
might
cite
out
of
my
own
experience
that
the
physicist
boltzmann
one
of
the
foremost
of
living
mathematicians
was
told
once
upon
a
time
that
his
demonstrations
were
not
sufficiently
detailed
to
be
intelligible
to
his
class
of
so
that
his
hearers
could
not
follow
him
as
a
result
he
carefully
counted
the
simplest
additions
or
interpolations
on
the
blackboard
but
at
the
same
time
integrated
them
in
his
head
a
thing
which
very
few
people
on
earth
can
do
it
was
simply
an
matter
for
this
genius
to
do
that
which
ungenial
mortals
can
not
this
appears
in
a
small
way
in
every
second
criminal
case
we
have
only
to
substitute
the
professionals
who
appear
as
witnesses
suppose
that
a
hunter
is
giving
testimony
he
will
omit
to
state
a
group
of
correlations
with
regard
to
things
which
are
involved
in
his
trade
he
will
reach
his
conclusion
with
a
single
jump
then
we
reach
the
fatal
circle
that
the
witness
supposes
that
we
can
follow
him
and
his
deductions
and
are
able
to
call
his
attention
to
any
significant
error
while
we
on
the
other
hand
depend
on
his
professional
knowledge
and
agree
to
his
leaping
inferences
and
allow
his
conclusions
to
pass
as
valid
without
knowing
or
being
able
to
test
them
the
notion
of
or
must
be
applied
in
such
instances
not
only
to
especial
proficients
in
some
particular
trade
but
also
to
such
people
as
have
by
accident
merely
any
form
of
specialized
knowledge
knowledge
of
the
place
in
which
some
case
had
occurred
people
with
such
knowledge
present
many
a
thing
as
that
can
not
be
so
to
people
who
do
not
possess
the
knowledge
hence
peasants
who
are
asked
about
some
road
in
their
own
well
known
country
reply
that
it
is
ahead
and
impossible
to
even
when
the
road
may
turn
ten
times
right
and
left
human
estimates
are
reliable
only
when
tested
and
reviewed
at
each
instant
complicated
deductions
are
so
only
when
deduction
after
deduction
has
been
tested
each
in
itself
lawyers
must
therefore
inevitably
follow
the
rule
of
requiring
explication
of
each
step
in
an
inference
such
a
requirement
will
at
least
narrow
the
limits
of
error
the
task
would
be
much
easier
if
we
were
fortunate
enough
to
be
able
to
help
ourselves
with
experiments
as
bernard
says
is
an
absolute
determinism
in
the
existential
conditions
of
natural
phenomena
as
much
in
living
as
in
bodies
if
the
condition
of
any
phenomenon
is
recognized
and
fulfilled
the
phenomenon
must
occur
whenever
the
experimenter
desires
but
such
determination
can
be
made
by
lawyers
in
rare
cases
only
and
the
criminalist
who
can
test
experimentally
the
generally
asserted
circumstance
attested
by
witnesses
accused
or
experts
is
a
rarissima
avis
in
most
cases
we
have
to
depend
on
our
experience
which
frequently
leaves
us
in
difficulties
if
we
fail
thoroughly
to
test
it
even
the
general
law
of
causation
that
every
effect
has
its
cause
is
formulated
as
hume
points
out
only
as
a
matter
of
habit
important
discovery
that
we
do
not
observe
causality
in
the
external
world
demonstrates
only
the
difficulty
of
the
interpretation
of
causality
the
weakness
of
his
doctrine
lies
in
his
assertion
that
the
knowledge
of
causality
may
be
obtained
through
habit
because
we
perceive
the
connection
of
similars
and
the
understanding
through
habit
deduces
the
appearance
of
the
one
from
that
of
the
other
these
assertions
of
the
great
thinker
are
certainly
correct
but
he
did
not
know
how
to
ground
them
hume
teaches
the
following
doctrine
the
proposition
that
causes
and
effects
are
recognized
not
by
the
understanding
but
because
of
experience
will
be
readily
granted
if
we
think
of
such
things
as
we
may
recollect
we
were
once
altogether
unacquainted
with
suppose
we
give
a
man
who
has
no
knowledge
of
physics
two
smooth
marble
plates
he
will
never
discover
that
when
laid
one
upon
the
other
they
are
hard
to
separate
here
it
is
easily
observed
that
such
properties
can
be
discovered
only
through
experience
nobody
again
has
the
desire
to
deceive
himself
into
believing
that
the
force
of
burning
powder
or
the
attraction
of
a
magnet
could
have
been
discovered
a
priori
but
this
truth
does
not
seem
to
have
the
same
validity
with
regard
to
such
processes
as
we
observed
almost
since
breath
began
with
regard
to
them
it
is
supposed
that
the
understanding
by
its
own
activity
without
the
help
of
experience
can
discover
causal
connections
it
is
supposed
that
anybody
who
is
suddenly
sent
into
the
world
will
be
able
at
once
to
deduce
that
a
billiard
ball
will
pass
its
motion
on
to
another
by
a
push
but
that
this
is
impossible
to
derive
a
priori
is
shown
through
the
fact
that
elasticity
is
not
an
externally
recognizable
quality
so
that
we
may
indeed
say
that
perhaps
no
effect
can
be
recognized
unless
it
is
experienced
at
least
once
it
can
not
be
deduced
a
priori
that
contact
with
water
makes
one
wet
or
that
an
object
responds
to
gravity
when
held
in
the
hand
or
that
it
is
painful
to
keep
a
finger
in
the
fire
these
facts
have
first
to
be
experienced
either
by
ourselves
or
some
other
person
every
cause
hume
argues
therefore
is
different
from
its
effect
and
hence
can
not
be
found
in
the
latter
and
every
discovery
or
representation
of
it
a
priori
must
remain
voluntary
all
that
the
understanding
can
do
is
to
simplify
the
fundamental
causes
of
natural
phenomena
and
to
deduce
the
individual
effects
from
a
few
general
sources
and
that
indeed
only
with
the
aid
of
analogy
experience
and
observation
but
then
what
is
meant
by
trusting
the
inference
of
another
person
and
what
in
the
other
narrative
is
free
from
inference
such
trust
means
to
be
convinced
that
the
other
has
made
the
correct
analogy
has
made
the
right
use
of
experience
and
has
observed
events
without
prejudice
that
is
a
great
deal
to
presuppose
and
whoever
takes
the
trouble
of
examining
however
simple
and
short
a
statement
of
a
witness
with
regard
to
analogy
experience
and
observation
must
finally
perceive
with
fear
how
blindly
the
witness
has
been
trusted
whoever
believes
in
knowledge
a
priori
will
have
an
easy
job
man
has
perceived
it
with
his
mind
and
reproduced
it
therewith
no
objection
may
be
raised
to
the
soundness
of
his
understanding
ergo
everything
may
be
relied
upon
just
as
he
has
testified
to
but
he
who
believes
in
the
more
uncomfortable
but
at
least
more
conscientious
skeptical
doctrine
has
at
the
minimum
some
fair
reason
for
believing
himself
able
to
trust
the
intelligence
of
a
witness
yet
he
neither
is
spared
the
task
of
testing
the
correctness
of
the
analogy
experience
and
observation
apriorism
and
skepticism
define
the
great
difference
in
the
attitude
toward
the
witness
both
skeptic
and
apriorist
have
to
test
the
desire
of
the
witness
to
lie
but
only
the
skeptic
needs
to
test
the
ability
to
tell
the
truth
and
his
possession
of
sufficient
understanding
to
reproduce
correctly
to
examine
closely
his
innumerable
inferences
from
analogy
experience
and
observation
that
only
the
skeptic
can
be
right
everybody
knows
who
has
at
all
noticed
how
various
people
differ
in
regard
to
analogies
how
very
different
the
experiences
of
a
single
man
are
both
in
their
observation
and
interpretation
to
distinguish
these
differences
clearly
is
the
main
task
of
our
investigation
there
are
two
conditions
to
consider
one
is
the
strict
difference
between
what
is
causally
related
and
its
accidental
concomitants
a
difference
with
regard
to
which
experience
is
so
often
misleading
for
two
phenomena
may
occur
together
at
the
same
time
without
being
causally
connected
when
a
man
is
ninety
years
old
and
has
observed
every
week
in
his
life
that
in
his
part
of
the
country
there
is
invariably
a
rainfall
every
tuesday
this
observation
is
richly
and
often
tested
yet
nobody
will
get
the
notion
of
causally
connecting
tuesday
and
rain
but
only
because
such
connection
would
be
regarded
as
generally
foolish
if
the
thing
however
may
be
attributed
to
coincidence
with
a
little
more
difficulty
then
it
becomes
easier
to
suppose
a
causal
connection
as
when
it
rains
on
day
or
at
the
new
moon
if
the
accidental
nature
of
the
connection
is
still
less
obvious
the
observation
becomes
a
and
energetically
defended
meteorological
law
this
happens
in
all
possible
fields
and
not
only
our
witnesses
but
we
ourselves
often
find
it
very
difficult
to
distinguish
between
causation
and
accident
the
only
useful
rule
to
follow
is
to
presuppose
accident
wherever
it
is
not
indubitably
and
from
the
first
excluded
and
carefully
to
examine
the
problem
for
whatever
causal
connection
it
may
possibly
reveal
is
united
in
any
perception
must
be
united
according
to
a
general
rule
but
a
great
deal
more
may
be
present
without
having
any
causal
the
second
important
condition
was
mentioned
by
schopenhauer
soon
as
we
have
assigned
causal
force
to
any
great
influence
and
thereby
recognized
that
it
is
efficacious
then
its
intensification
in
the
face
of
any
resistance
according
to
the
intensity
of
the
resistance
will
produce
finally
the
appropriate
effect
whoever
can
not
be
bribed
by
ten
dollars
but
vacillates
will
be
bribed
by
or
this
simple
example
may
be
generalized
into
a
golden
rule
for
lawyers
and
requires
them
to
test
the
effect
of
any
force
on
the
accused
at
an
earlier
time
in
the
life
or
in
other
cases
the
early
life
of
the
latter
can
never
be
studied
with
sufficient
care
this
study
is
of
especial
importance
when
the
question
is
one
of
determining
the
culpability
of
the
accused
with
regard
to
a
certain
crime
we
have
then
to
ask
whether
he
had
the
motive
in
question
or
whether
the
crime
could
have
been
of
interest
to
him
in
this
investigation
the
problem
of
the
necessary
intensity
of
the
influence
in
question
need
not
for
the
time
be
considered
only
its
presence
needs
to
be
determined
that
it
may
have
disappeared
without
any
demonstrable
special
reason
is
not
supposable
for
inclinations
qualities
and
passions
are
rarely
lost
they
need
not
become
obvious
so
long
as
opportunity
and
stimulus
are
absent
and
they
may
be
in
some
degree
suppressed
but
they
manifest
themselves
as
soon
as
or
fifty
dollars
appear
the
problem
is
most
difficult
when
it
requires
the
conversion
of
certain
related
properties
when
the
problem
is
one
of
suspecting
a
person
of
murderous
inclination
and
all
that
can
be
shown
in
his
past
life
is
the
maltreatment
of
animals
or
again
when
cruelty
has
to
be
shown
and
all
that
is
established
is
great
sensuality
or
when
there
is
no
doubt
about
cruelty
and
the
problem
is
one
of
supposing
intense
avarice
these
questions
of
conversion
are
not
especially
difficult
but
when
it
must
be
explained
to
what
such
qualities
as
very
exquisite
egoism
declared
envy
abnormal
desire
for
honor
exaggerated
conceit
and
great
idleness
may
lead
to
the
problem
requires
great
caution
and
intensive
study
section
c
skepticism
skepticism
is
directly
connected
with
the
subject
of
the
preceding
chapter
but
wants
still
a
few
words
for
itself
though
it
is
not
the
problem
to
take
an
attitude
with
regard
to
philosophical
skepticism
his
work
becomes
essentially
easier
through
the
study
of
doctrines
according
to
these
all
we
know
and
infer
in
so
far
as
it
is
unmathematical
results
from
experience
and
our
conviction
of
it
and
our
reasoning
about
it
means
by
which
we
pass
the
bounds
of
depend
on
sensation
memory
and
inference
from
causation
our
knowledge
of
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
results
also
from
experience
and
the
doctrine
applied
to
the
work
of
the
criminalist
may
be
formulated
as
follows
we
take
as
true
is
not
an
intellectual
deduction
but
an
empirical
in
other
words
our
presuppositions
and
inferential
knowledge
depend
only
upon
those
innumerable
repetitions
of
events
from
which
we
postulate
that
the
event
recurred
in
the
place
in
question
this
sets
us
the
problem
of
determining
whether
the
similar
cases
with
which
we
compare
the
present
one
really
are
similar
and
if
they
are
known
in
sufficiently
large
numbers
to
exclude
everything
else
consider
a
simple
example
suppose
somebody
who
had
traveled
all
through
europe
but
had
never
seen
or
heard
of
a
negro
thought
about
the
pigmentation
of
human
beings
neither
all
his
thinking
nor
the
assistance
of
all
possible
scientific
means
can
lead
him
to
the
conclusion
that
there
are
also
black
people
that
fact
he
can
only
discover
not
think
out
if
he
depends
only
on
experience
he
must
conclude
from
the
millions
of
examples
he
has
observed
that
all
human
beings
are
white
his
mistake
consists
in
the
fact
that
the
immense
number
of
people
he
has
seen
belong
to
the
inhabitants
of
a
single
zone
and
that
he
has
to
the
inhabitants
of
other
regions
in
our
own
cases
we
need
no
examples
for
i
know
of
no
inference
which
was
not
made
in
the
following
fashion
situation
was
so
in
a
hundred
cases
it
must
be
so
in
this
we
rarely
ask
whether
we
know
enough
examples
whether
they
were
the
correct
ones
and
whether
they
were
exhaustive
it
will
be
no
mistake
to
assert
that
we
lawyers
do
this
more
or
less
consciously
on
the
supposition
that
we
have
an
immense
collection
of
suggestive
a
priori
inferences
which
the
human
understanding
has
brought
together
for
thousands
of
years
and
hence
believe
them
to
be
indubitably
certain
if
we
recognize
that
all
these
presuppositions
are
compounds
of
experience
and
that
every
experience
may
finally
show
itself
to
be
deceptive
and
false
if
we
recognize
how
the
actual
progress
of
human
knowledge
consists
in
the
addition
of
one
hundred
new
experiences
to
a
thousand
old
ones
and
if
we
recognize
that
many
of
the
new
ones
contradict
the
old
ones
if
we
recognize
the
consequence
that
there
is
no
reason
for
the
mathematical
deduction
from
the
first
to
the
case
we
shall
make
fewer
mistakes
and
do
less
harm
in
this
regard
hume
is
very
illuminative
according
to
masaryk
the
fundamental
doctrine
of
humian
skepticism
is
as
follows
i
have
had
one
and
the
same
experience
ever
so
often
if
i
have
seen
the
sun
go
up
times
i
expect
to
see
it
go
up
the
time
the
next
day
but
i
have
no
guarantee
no
certainty
no
evidence
for
this
belief
experience
looks
only
to
the
past
not
to
the
future
how
can
i
then
discover
the
sunrise
in
the
first
sunrises
experience
reveals
in
me
the
habit
to
expect
similar
effects
from
similar
circumstances
but
the
intellect
has
no
share
in
this
all
the
sciences
based
on
experience
are
uncertain
and
without
logical
foundation
even
though
their
results
as
a
whole
and
in
the
mass
are
predictable
only
mathematics
offers
certainty
and
evidence
therefore
according
to
hume
sciences
based
on
experience
are
unsafe
because
the
recognition
of
causal
connection
depends
on
the
facts
of
experience
and
we
can
attain
to
certain
knowledge
of
the
facts
of
experience
only
on
the
ground
of
the
evident
relation
of
cause
and
effect
this
view
was
first
opposed
by
reid
who
tried
to
demonstrate
that
we
have
a
clear
notion
of
necessary
connection
he
grants
that
this
notion
is
not
directly
attained
either
from
external
or
internal
experience
but
asserts
its
clearness
and
certainty
in
spite
of
that
fact
our
mind
has
the
power
to
make
its
own
concepts
and
one
such
concept
is
that
of
necessary
connection
kant
goes
further
and
says
that
hume
failed
to
recognize
the
full
consequences
of
his
own
analysis
for
the
notion
of
causality
is
not
the
only
one
which
the
understanding
uses
to
represent
a
priori
the
connection
of
objects
and
hence
kant
defines
psychologically
and
logically
a
whole
system
of
similar
concepts
his
of
pure
is
intended
historically
and
logically
as
the
refutation
of
skepticism
it
aims
to
show
that
not
only
metaphysics
and
natural
science
have
for
their
basis
judgments
a
priori
but
that
mathematics
also
rests
on
the
same
foundation
be
that
as
it
may
our
task
is
to
discover
the
application
of
skepticism
to
our
own
problems
in
some
clear
example
let
us
suppose
that
there
are
a
dozen
instances
of
people
who
grew
to
be
from
to
years
old
these
instances
occur
among
countless
millions
of
cases
in
which
such
an
age
was
not
reached
if
this
small
proportion
is
recognized
it
justifies
the
postulate
that
nobody
on
earth
may
attain
to
years
but
now
it
is
known
that
the
englishman
thomas
parr
got
to
be
years
old
and
his
countryman
jenkins
was
shown
according
to
the
indubitable
proofs
of
the
royal
society
to
be
years
old
at
least
according
to
his
portrait
in
a
copper
etching
he
was
years
old
yet
as
this
is
the
most
that
has
been
scientifically
proved
i
am
justified
in
saying
that
nobody
can
grow
to
be
years
old
nevertheless
because
there
are
people
who
have
attained
the
age
of
to
years
nobody
would
care
to
assert
that
it
is
absolutely
impossible
to
grow
so
old
the
names
and
histories
of
these
people
are
recorded
and
their
existence
removes
the
great
reason
against
this
possibility
we
have
to
deal
then
only
with
greater
or
lesser
possibilities
and
agree
with
the
humian
idea
that
under
similar
conditions
frequency
of
occurrence
implies
repetition
in
the
next
instance
contrary
evidence
may
be
derived
from
several
phenomena
of
alternation
it
is
a
well
known
fact
that
a
number
in
the
little
lottery
which
has
not
been
drawn
for
a
long
time
is
sure
finally
to
be
drawn
if
among
numbers
the
number
has
not
turned
up
for
a
long
time
its
appearance
becomes
more
probable
with
every
successive
drawing
all
the
mathematical
combinations
of
players
depend
on
this
experience
which
generalized
might
be
held
to
read
the
oftener
any
event
occurs
as
the
failure
of
the
number
to
be
drawn
the
less
is
the
probability
of
its
recurrence
it
becomes
more
probable
that
will
be
drawn
and
this
seems
the
contrary
of
proposition
it
may
at
first
be
said
that
the
example
ought
to
be
put
in
a
different
form
as
follows
if
i
know
that
a
bag
contains
marbles
the
color
of
which
i
do
not
know
and
if
i
draw
them
one
by
one
and
always
find
the
marble
i
have
drawn
to
be
white
the
probability
that
the
bag
contains
only
white
ones
grows
with
every
new
drawing
that
brings
a
white
marble
to
light
if
the
bag
contains
marbles
and
have
been
drawn
out
nobody
would
suppose
that
the
last
one
would
be
red
for
the
repetition
of
any
event
increases
the
probability
of
its
occurrence
this
formulation
proves
nothing
inasmuch
as
a
different
example
does
not
contradict
the
one
it
is
intended
to
substitute
the
explanation
is
rather
as
follows
in
the
first
case
there
is
involved
the
norm
of
equal
possibilities
and
if
we
apply
the
humian
principle
of
increase
of
probability
through
repetition
we
find
it
effective
in
explaining
the
example
we
have
known
until
now
always
that
the
numbers
in
the
little
lottery
are
drawn
equally
and
with
approximate
regularity
none
of
the
single
numbers
is
drawn
for
a
disproportionately
long
time
and
as
this
fact
is
invariable
we
may
suppose
that
every
individual
number
would
appear
with
comparative
regularity
but
this
explanation
is
in
accord
with
doctrine
the
doctrine
clarifies
even
astonishing
statistical
miracles
we
know
that
every
year
there
come
together
in
a
certain
region
a
large
number
of
suicides
fractures
of
arms
and
legs
assaults
unaddressed
letters
etc
when
now
we
discover
that
the
number
of
suicides
in
a
certain
semester
is
significantly
less
than
the
number
in
the
same
semester
of
another
year
we
will
postulate
that
in
the
next
a
comparatively
larger
number
of
suicides
will
take
place
so
that
the
number
for
the
whole
year
will
become
approximately
equal
suppose
we
say
were
in
the
months
of
january
february
march
april
may
and
june
an
average
of
x
cases
because
we
have
observed
the
average
to
happen
six
times
we
conclude
that
it
will
not
happen
in
the
other
months
but
that
instead
cases
will
occur
in
those
months
since
otherwise
the
average
annual
count
will
not
be
this
would
be
a
mistaken
abstraction
of
the
principle
of
equal
distribution
from
the
general
humian
law
for
the
humian
law
applied
to
this
case
indicates
a
long
series
of
years
we
have
observed
that
in
this
region
there
occur
annually
so
and
so
many
suicides
we
conclude
therefore
that
in
this
year
also
there
will
occur
a
similar
number
of
the
principle
of
equal
distribution
presents
itself
therefore
as
a
subordinate
rule
which
must
not
be
separated
from
the
principal
law
it
is
indeed
valid
for
the
simplest
events
when
i
resolve
to
walk
in
x
street
which
i
know
well
and
when
i
recall
whether
is
sunday
or
a
week
day
what
time
it
is
and
what
the
weather
is
like
i
know
quite
accurately
how
the
street
will
look
with
regard
to
the
people
that
may
be
met
there
although
a
large
number
of
these
people
have
chosen
the
time
accidentally
and
might
as
well
have
passed
through
another
street
if
for
once
there
were
more
people
in
the
street
i
should
immediately
ask
myself
what
unusual
event
had
taken
place
one
of
my
cousins
who
had
a
good
deal
of
free
time
to
dispose
of
spent
it
for
several
months
with
the
assistance
of
his
comrade
in
counting
the
number
of
horses
that
passed
daily
in
the
course
of
two
hours
by
a
caf√©
they
frequented
the
conscientious
and
controlled
count
indicated
that
every
day
there
came
one
bay
horse
to
every
four
if
then
on
any
given
day
an
incommensurably
large
number
of
brown
black
and
tawny
horses
came
in
the
course
of
the
first
hour
the
counters
were
forced
to
infer
that
in
the
next
minutes
horses
of
a
different
color
must
come
and
that
a
greater
number
of
bays
must
appear
in
order
to
restore
the
disturbed
equilibrium
such
an
inference
is
not
contradictory
to
the
humian
proposition
at
the
end
of
a
series
of
examinations
the
counters
were
compelled
to
say
so
many
days
we
have
counted
one
bay
to
every
four
horses
we
must
therefore
suppose
that
a
similar
relationship
will
be
maintained
the
next
so
the
lawyer
too
must
suppose
although
we
lawyers
have
nothing
to
do
with
figures
that
he
knows
nothing
a
priori
and
must
construct
his
inferences
entirely
from
experience
and
hence
we
must
agree
that
our
premises
for
such
inferences
are
uncertain
and
often
subject
to
revision
and
often
likely
in
their
application
to
new
facts
to
lead
to
serious
mistakes
particularly
if
the
number
of
experiences
from
which
the
next
moment
is
deduced
are
too
few
or
if
an
unknown
but
very
important
condition
is
omitted
these
facts
must
carefully
be
kept
in
mind
with
reference
to
the
testimony
of
experts
without
showing
ourselves
suspicious
or
desirous
of
confusing
the
professional
in
his
own
work
we
must
consider
that
the
progress
of
knowledge
consists
in
the
collection
of
instances
and
anything
that
might
have
been
normal
in
cases
need
not
in
any
sense
be
so
when
cases
are
in
question
yesterday
the
norm
may
have
been
subject
to
no
exception
exceptions
are
noted
and
the
exception
has
become
the
rule
hence
rules
which
have
no
exceptions
grow
progressively
rarer
and
wherever
a
single
exception
is
discovered
the
rule
can
no
longer
be
held
as
normative
thus
before
new
holland
was
discovered
all
swans
were
supposed
to
be
white
all
mammals
incapable
of
laying
eggs
now
we
know
that
there
are
black
swans
and
that
the
lays
eggs
who
would
have
dared
to
assert
before
the
discovery
of
the
that
light
can
penetrate
wood
and
who
especially
has
dared
to
make
generalizations
with
regard
to
the
great
inventions
of
our
time
which
were
not
afterwards
contradicted
by
the
facts
it
may
be
that
the
time
is
not
too
far
away
in
which
great
tenable
and
unexceptionable
principles
may
be
posited
but
the
present
tendency
is
to
beware
of
generalizations
even
so
far
as
to
regard
it
a
sign
of
scientific
insight
when
the
composition
of
generally
valid
propositions
is
made
with
great
caution
in
this
regard
the
great
physicians
of
our
time
are
excellent
examples
they
hold
the
phenomenon
a
is
caused
by
b
we
do
not
know
but
nobody
has
ever
yet
seen
a
case
of
a
in
which
the
precedence
of
b
could
not
be
our
experts
should
take
the
same
attitude
in
most
cases
it
might
be
more
uncomfortable
for
us
but
certainly
will
be
safer
for
if
they
do
not
take
that
attitude
we
are
in
duty
bound
to
presuppose
in
our
conclusions
that
they
have
taken
it
only
in
this
wise
by
protecting
ourselves
against
apparently
exceptionless
general
rules
can
our
work
be
safely
carried
on
this
becomes
especially
our
duty
where
believing
ourselves
to
have
discovered
some
generally
valid
rule
we
are
compelled
to
draw
conclusions
without
the
assistance
of
experts
how
often
have
we
depended
upon
our
understanding
and
our
a
priori
method
of
inference
where
that
was
only
experience
and
such
poor
experience
we
lawyers
have
not
yet
brought
our
science
so
far
as
to
be
able
to
make
use
of
the
experience
of
our
comrades
with
material
they
have
reviewed
and
defined
in
writing
we
have
bothered
a
great
deal
about
the
exposition
of
some
legal
difficulty
the
definition
of
some
judicial
concept
but
we
have
received
little
instruction
or
tradition
concerning
mankind
and
its
passions
hence
each
one
has
to
depend
on
his
own
experience
and
that
is
supposed
to
be
considerable
if
it
has
a
score
of
years
to
its
back
and
is
somewhat
supplemented
by
the
experience
of
others
in
this
regard
there
are
no
indubitable
rules
everybody
must
tell
himself
have
perhaps
never
experienced
this
fact
but
it
may
be
that
a
thousand
other
people
have
seen
it
and
seen
it
in
a
thousand
different
ways
how
then
and
whence
my
right
to
exclude
every
exception
we
must
never
forget
that
every
rule
is
shattered
whenever
any
single
element
of
the
situation
is
unknown
and
that
happens
very
easily
and
frequently
suppose
that
i
did
not
have
full
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
water
and
walked
on
terra
firma
to
the
edge
of
some
quiet
calm
pool
when
now
i
presume
water
has
a
body
it
has
a
definite
density
it
has
consistency
weight
i
will
also
presume
that
i
may
go
on
walking
over
its
surface
just
as
over
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
that
simply
because
i
am
ignorant
of
its
fluidity
and
its
specific
gravity
liebman
summarizes
the
situation
as
follows
the
causal
nexus
the
existential
and
objective
relation
between
lightning
and
thunder
the
firing
of
powder
and
the
explosion
are
altogether
different
from
the
logical
nexus
the
mere
conceptual
connection
between
antecedent
and
consequent
in
deduction
this
constitutes
the
well
known
kernel
of
humian
skepticism
we
must
keep
in
mind
clearly
that
we
never
can
know
with
certainty
whether
we
are
in
possession
of
all
the
determining
factors
of
a
phenomenon
and
hence
we
must
adhere
to
the
only
unexceptionable
rule
careful
about
making
rules
that
admit
of
no
there
is
still
another
objection
to
discuss
the
mathematical
exception
to
humian
skepticism
it
might
be
held
that
inasmuch
as
the
science
of
justice
is
closely
related
in
many
ways
to
mathematics
it
may
permit
of
propositions
a
priori
leibnitz
already
had
said
mathematicians
count
with
numbers
the
lawyers
with
ideas
fundamentally
both
do
the
same
if
the
relationship
were
really
so
close
general
skepticism
about
phenomenal
sciences
could
not
be
applied
to
the
legal
disciplines
but
we
nowadays
deal
not
with
concepts
merely
and
in
spite
of
all
obstruction
time
has
passed
and
the
realities
of
our
profession
indeed
its
most
important
object
the
human
being
itself
constitute
an
integrating
part
of
our
studies
and
the
question
may
be
still
further
raised
whether
mathematics
is
really
so
exempt
from
skepticism
the
work
of
gauss
lobatschewski
bolyai
lambert
would
make
the
answer
negative
let
us
for
once
consider
what
significance
mathematical
postulates
have
when
pythagoras
discovered
his
proposition
in
such
a
way
that
he
first
drew
a
triangle
and
then
built
a
square
on
each
of
the
sides
and
finally
measured
the
area
of
each
and
compared
them
he
must
at
first
have
got
the
notion
that
that
also
might
be
merely
accidental
if
he
had
made
the
construction
or
times
with
various
triangles
and
these
had
resulted
always
identically
only
then
might
he
have
been
justified
in
saying
that
he
had
apparently
discovered
a
theorem
but
then
his
process
was
just
as
thoroughly
experiential
as
that
of
a
scientist
who
says
that
a
bird
has
never
yet
been
observed
to
give
birth
to
living
young
and
that
hence
all
birds
lay
eggs
but
pythagoras
did
not
proceed
in
this
experiential
manner
in
the
discovery
of
his
theorem
he
constructed
and
he
counted
and
when
he
did
that
he
acted
on
postulates
this
is
a
triangle
and
if
that
be
a
square
so
and
this
is
just
what
is
done
in
every
science
the
general
propositions
are
the
relations
remain
the
same
as
formerly
the
moon
must
rise
at
such
and
such
a
this
step
in
a
deduction
is
not
false
if
it
is
well
grounded
at
this
point
if
it
really
refers
to
x
it
follows
in
his
procedures
the
criminalist
does
exactly
the
same
thing
what
he
must
be
skeptical
about
is
the
postulates
from
which
he
starts
section
d
the
empirical
method
in
the
study
of
cases
properly
to
bound
our
discussion
of
humian
skepticism
a
few
words
have
to
be
said
concerning
the
empirical
method
of
the
sciences
we
will
call
those
laws
purely
empirical
which
in
the
study
of
nature
yield
regularities
that
are
demonstrated
by
observation
and
experiment
but
upon
which
little
or
no
reliance
is
placed
with
regard
to
cases
which
differ
considerably
from
the
observed
the
latter
is
done
because
no
reason
is
seen
for
the
existence
of
such
laws
the
empirical
rule
is
therefore
no
final
law
but
is
capable
of
explaining
especially
when
true
the
succession
of
a
certain
condition
of
weather
from
certain
meteorological
signs
the
improvement
of
species
through
crossing
the
fact
that
some
alloys
are
harder
than
their
components
and
so
on
or
to
choose
examples
from
our
own
field
jurisprudence
may
assert
as
empirical
law
that
a
murderer
is
a
criminal
who
has
gone
unpunished
for
his
earlier
crimes
that
all
gamblers
show
such
significant
resemblances
that
the
criminal
who
has
soiled
his
hands
with
blood
in
some
violent
crime
was
accustomed
to
wipe
them
on
the
underside
of
a
table
that
the
slyest
person
generally
perpetrates
some
gross
stupidity
after
committing
a
serious
crime
and
so
renders
discovery
simpler
that
lust
and
cruelty
have
a
certain
relation
that
superstition
plays
a
great
r√¥le
in
crime
etc
it
is
of
exceeding
importance
to
establish
such
purely
empiric
laws
in
our
science
which
has
done
little
with
such
matters
because
owing
to
scanty
research
into
most
of
them
we
need
these
laws
we
know
approximately
that
this
and
that
have
come
to
light
so
and
so
often
but
we
have
not
reduced
to
order
and
studied
systematically
the
cases
before
us
and
we
dare
not
call
this
knowledge
natural
law
because
we
have
subjected
it
to
no
inductive
procedure
reference
of
any
fact
discovered
by
experience
to
general
laws
or
rules
we
call
induction
it
embraces
both
observation
and
again
it
may
be
defined
as
generalization
or
universalization
of
our
experiences
and
inference
that
a
phenomenon
occurring
x
times
will
invariably
occur
when
the
essential
circumstances
remain
identical
the
earliest
investigators
started
with
the
simplest
inductions
that
fire
burns
that
water
flows
downward
so
that
new
simple
truths
were
continually
discovered
this
is
the
type
of
scientific
induction
and
it
requires
further
the
addition
of
certainty
and
the
foregoing
might
have
been
written
expressly
for
us
lawyers
but
we
have
to
bear
in
mind
that
we
have
not
proceeded
in
our
own
generalizations
beyond
burns
water
flows
and
such
propositions
we
have
only
derived
from
other
disciplines
those
derived
from
our
own
are
very
few
indeed
and
to
get
more
we
have
very
far
to
go
moreover
the
laws
of
experience
are
in
no
way
so
certain
as
they
are
supposed
to
be
even
when
mathematically
conceived
the
empirical
law
is
established
that
the
sum
of
the
three
angles
of
a
triangle
is
equal
to
two
right
angles
and
yet
nobody
ever
since
the
science
of
surveying
has
been
invented
has
succeeded
in
discovering
degrees
in
any
triangle
now
then
when
even
such
things
supposed
ever
since
our
youth
to
be
valid
are
not
at
all
true
or
true
theoretically
only
how
much
more
careful
must
we
be
in
making
inferences
from
much
less
certain
rules
even
though
we
have
succeeded
in
using
them
before
in
many
analogous
cases
the
activity
of
a
criminalist
is
of
far
too
short
duration
to
permit
him
to
experience
any
more
than
a
very
small
portion
of
the
possibilities
of
life
and
suggestions
from
foreign
sources
are
very
rare
the
situation
is
different
in
other
disciplines
experience
says
james
sully
us
to
express
a
number
of
additional
convictions
we
can
predict
political
changes
and
scientific
developments
and
can
conceive
of
the
geographical
conditions
at
the
north
other
disciplines
are
justified
to
assert
such
additional
propositions
but
is
ours
a
man
may
have
dealt
for
years
with
thieves
and
swindlers
but
is
he
justified
in
deducing
from
the
inductions
made
in
his
experience
the
situation
of
the
first
murderer
he
deals
with
is
he
right
in
translating
things
learned
by
dealing
with
educated
people
to
cases
where
only
peasants
appear
in
all
these
cases
what
is
needed
in
making
deductions
is
great
caution
and
continual
reminder
to
be
very
careful
for
our
work
here
still
lacks
the
proper
material
in
addition
we
have
to
bear
in
mind
that
induction
is
intimately
related
to
analogy
according
to
lipps
the
ground
of
one
is
the
ground
of
the
other
they
both
rest
on
the
same
foundation
i
am
still
in
doubt
whether
the
fact
on
which
a
moment
ago
i
depended
as
the
sufficient
condition
for
a
judgment
may
still
be
so
regarded
the
induction
is
uncertain
it
is
unjustified
when
i
take
for
sufficiently
valid
something
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
ought
not
to
be
so
if
we
bear
in
mind
how
much
we
are
warned
against
the
use
of
analogy
how
it
is
expressly
excluded
in
the
application
of
certain
criminal
laws
and
how
dangerous
the
use
of
every
analogy
is
we
must
be
convinced
that
the
use
for
our
cases
of
both
induction
and
analogy
is
always
menace
we
have
at
the
same
time
to
bear
in
mind
how
much
use
we
actually
make
of
both
even
our
general
rules
concerning
false
testimony
bias
revertibility
special
inclinations
and
our
doctrines
concerning
the
composition
and
indirection
of
testimony
even
our
rules
concerning
the
value
of
witnesses
and
confessions
all
these
depend
upon
induction
and
analogy
we
pass
by
their
use
in
every
trial
from
case
to
case
a
means
so
frequently
and
universally
used
must
however
be
altogether
reliable
or
be
handled
with
the
greatest
care
as
it
is
not
the
first
it
must
be
handled
in
the
second
way
we
have
yet
to
indicate
the
various
ways
in
which
induction
may
be
used
fick
has
already
called
attention
to
the
astounding
question
concluding
system
of
logic
why
in
many
cases
is
a
single
example
sufficient
to
complete
induction
while
in
other
cases
myriads
of
unanimous
instances
admitting
of
no
single
known
or
suspected
exception
make
only
a
small
step
toward
the
establishment
of
a
generally
valid
judgment
this
question
is
of
enormous
significance
in
criminal
cases
because
it
is
not
easy
to
determine
in
any
particular
trial
whether
we
have
to
deal
with
a
situation
of
the
first
sort
where
a
single
example
is
evidential
or
a
situation
of
the
second
sort
where
a
great
many
examples
fail
to
be
evidential
on
this
difficulty
great
mistakes
depend
particularly
mistakes
of
substitution
of
the
first
for
the
second
we
are
satisfied
in
such
cases
with
a
few
examples
and
suppose
ourselves
to
have
proved
the
case
although
nothing
whatever
has
been
established
we
must
see
first
of
all
if
it
is
of
any
use
to
refer
the
difficulty
of
the
matter
to
the
form
in
which
the
question
is
put
and
to
say
the
difficulty
results
from
the
question
itself
if
it
be
asked
any
of
the
thousand
marbles
in
the
bag
white
marbles
the
question
is
determined
by
the
first
handful
if
the
latter
brings
to
light
a
single
white
marble
if
however
the
problem
is
phrased
so
does
the
bag
contain
white
marbles
then
although
marbles
might
already
have
been
drawn
from
the
receptacle
it
can
not
be
determined
that
the
last
marble
of
the
is
white
in
the
same
way
if
people
assert
that
the
form
of
the
question
determines
the
answer
it
does
not
follow
that
the
form
of
the
question
is
itself
determined
or
distinguished
inasmuch
as
the
object
belongs
to
the
first
or
the
second
of
the
above
named
categories
a
safe
method
of
distinction
consists
in
calling
the
first
form
of
the
question
positive
and
the
second
negative
the
positive
refers
to
a
single
unit
the
negative
to
a
boundless
unit
if
then
i
ask
are
there
any
white
marbles
whatever
in
the
bag
the
answer
is
rendered
affirmative
by
the
discovery
of
a
single
white
marble
but
if
the
question
is
phrased
are
there
white
marbles
in
the
bag
merely
its
form
is
positive
but
its
intent
is
negative
to
conform
the
manner
of
the
question
to
its
intent
it
would
be
necessary
to
ask
are
there
no
other
colors
than
white
among
the
marbles
in
the
bag
and
inasmuch
as
the
negative
under
given
circumstances
is
in
many
ways
boundless
the
question
admits
of
no
answer
until
the
last
marble
has
been
brought
to
light
if
the
total
number
of
marbles
is
unlimited
the
question
can
receive
no
complete
inductive
answer
in
mathematical
form
it
can
be
solved
only
approximately
so
again
if
one
asks
are
there
any
purely
blue
birds
the
answer
is
affirmative
as
soon
as
a
single
completely
blue
bird
is
brought
to
light
but
if
the
question
is
do
not
also
striped
birds
exist
no
answer
is
possible
until
the
very
last
bird
on
earth
is
exhibited
in
that
way
only
could
the
possibility
be
excluded
that
not
one
of
the
terrestrial
fowls
is
striped
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
are
satisfied
with
a
much
less
complete
induction
so
we
say
almost
the
whole
earth
has
been
covered
by
naturalists
and
not
one
of
them
reports
having
observed
a
striped
bird
hence
there
would
be
none
such
even
in
the
unexplored
parts
of
the
earth
this
is
an
inductive
inference
and
its
justification
is
quite
another
question
the
above
mentioned
distinction
may
be
made
still
clearer
if
instead
of
looking
back
to
the
form
of
the
question
we
study
only
the
answer
we
have
then
to
say
that
positive
statements
are
justified
by
the
existence
of
a
single
instance
negative
assertions
only
by
the
complete
enumeration
of
all
possible
instances
and
never
at
all
if
the
instances
be
boundless
that
the
negative
proof
always
requires
a
series
of
demonstrations
is
well
known
the
one
thing
which
may
be
firmly
believed
is
the
fact
that
the
problem
whether
a
single
example
is
sufficient
or
a
million
are
insufficient
is
only
a
form
of
the
problem
of
affirmative
and
negative
assertions
so
then
if
i
ask
has
a
ever
stolen
anything
it
is
enough
to
record
one
judgment
against
him
or
to
bring
one
witness
on
the
matter
in
order
to
establish
that
a
committed
theft
at
least
once
in
his
life
if
however
it
is
to
be
proved
that
the
man
has
never
committed
a
theft
his
whole
life
must
be
reviewed
point
by
point
and
it
must
be
shown
that
at
no
instant
of
it
did
he
commit
larceny
in
such
cases
we
are
content
with
much
less
we
say
first
of
all
we
will
not
inquire
whether
the
man
has
never
stolen
we
will
see
merely
whether
he
was
never
punished
for
theft
but
here
too
we
must
beware
and
not
commit
ourselves
to
inquiring
of
all
the
authorities
in
the
world
but
only
of
a
single
authority
who
we
assume
ought
to
know
whether
a
was
punished
or
not
if
we
go
still
further
we
say
that
inasmuch
as
we
have
not
heard
from
any
authorities
that
the
man
was
ever
punished
for
stealing
we
suppose
that
the
man
was
never
punished
on
that
ground
and
inasmuch
as
we
have
not
examined
anybody
who
had
seen
a
steal
we
preferably
suppose
that
he
has
never
stolen
this
is
what
we
call
satisfactory
evidence
and
with
the
poor
means
at
our
disposal
it
must
suffice
in
most
cases
we
have
to
deal
with
mixed
evidence
and
frequently
it
has
become
habitual
to
change
the
problem
to
be
solved
according
to
our
convenience
or
at
least
to
set
aside
some
one
thing
suppose
that
the
issue
deals
with
a
discovered
footprint
of
a
man
we
then
suspect
somebody
and
compare
the
sole
of
his
shoe
with
the
impression
they
fit
in
length
and
width
in
the
number
of
nails
and
in
all
the
other
possible
indices
and
we
therefore
assert
it
is
the
footprint
of
the
suspect
for
footprint
is
the
problem
we
are
troubling
ourselves
to
solve
in
truth
we
have
only
shown
that
the
particular
relations
in
the
matter
of
length
breadth
number
of
nails
agree
and
hence
we
regard
the
positive
part
of
the
evidence
as
sufficient
and
neglect
the
whole
troublesome
negative
part
which
might
establish
the
fact
that
at
the
time
and
in
the
region
in
question
nobody
was
or
could
be
whose
foot
could
accurately
fit
that
particular
footprint
therefore
we
have
not
proved
but
have
only
calculated
the
probability
that
at
the
time
there
might
possibly
not
have
been
another
person
with
a
shoe
of
similar
length
breadth
and
number
of
nails
the
probability
becomes
naturally
less
as
fewer
details
come
to
hand
the
difficulty
lies
in
finding
where
such
probability
which
stands
for
at
least
an
assumption
must
no
longer
be
considered
suppose
now
that
neither
nor
patches
nor
other
clear
clews
can
be
proved
and
only
length
and
width
agree
if
the
agreement
of
the
clews
were
really
a
substantiation
of
the
proof
by
evidence
it
would
have
to
suffice
as
positive
evidence
but
as
has
been
explained
the
thing
proved
is
not
the
point
at
issue
but
another
point
the
negative
portion
of
the
evidence
will
naturally
be
developed
with
less
accuracy
the
proof
is
limited
to
the
assertion
that
such
shoes
as
were
indicated
in
the
evidence
were
very
rarely
or
never
worn
in
that
region
also
that
no
native
could
have
been
present
that
the
form
of
the
nails
allowed
inference
of
somebody
from
foreign
regions
one
of
which
might
be
the
home
of
the
suspect
etc
such
an
examination
shows
that
what
we
call
evidence
is
only
probability
or
possibility
another
form
which
seems
to
contradict
the
assertion
that
negative
propositions
are
infinite
is
positive
evidence
in
the
shape
of
negation
if
we
give
an
expert
a
stain
to
examine
and
ask
him
whether
it
is
a
blood
stain
and
he
tells
us
is
not
a
blood
stain
then
this
single
scientifically
established
assertion
proves
that
we
do
not
have
to
deal
with
blood
and
hence
proof
seems
brought
in
a
single
instance
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
deal
here
with
an
actually
positive
proof
for
the
expert
has
given
us
the
deduced
proposition
not
the
essential
assertion
he
has
found
the
stain
to
be
a
rust
stain
or
a
tobacco
stain
and
hence
he
may
assert
and
deduce
that
it
is
not
blood
even
were
he
a
skeptic
he
would
say
have
not
yet
seen
the
blood
of
a
mammal
in
which
the
characteristic
signs
for
recognition
were
not
present
and
we
have
never
yet
recognized
a
body
without
the
blood
pertaining
to
it
and
hence
we
may
say
we
are
not
dealing
with
blood
because
all
of
us
found
the
characteristics
of
the
stain
to
be
what
we
have
been
until
now
accustomed
to
call
the
characteristics
of
rust
we
have
still
to
touch
upon
the
difference
between
logical
connection
and
experience
if
i
say
mineral
tastes
salty
therefore
it
is
soluble
in
water
the
inference
depends
upon
logical
relationships
for
my
intent
is
i
perceive
a
salty
taste
it
has
to
be
brought
to
the
nerves
of
taste
which
can
be
done
only
by
the
combination
of
the
mineral
with
the
saliva
hence
by
its
solution
in
the
saliva
but
if
it
is
soluble
in
saliva
it
must
also
be
soluble
in
if
i
say
on
the
other
hand
mineral
tastes
salty
has
a
hardness
of
a
specific
gravity
of
and
consequently
it
crystallizes
hexagonally
this
statement
depends
on
experience
for
what
i
really
say
is
know
first
of
all
that
a
mineral
which
has
the
qualities
mentioned
must
be
rock
salt
for
at
the
least
we
know
of
no
mineral
which
has
these
qualities
and
is
not
rock
salt
and
which
in
the
second
place
crystallizes
hexagonally
as
rock
salt
does
a
way
which
at
least
we
find
rock
salt
never
to
have
if
we
examine
the
matter
still
more
closely
we
become
convinced
that
in
the
first
case
only
the
formal
and
logical
side
in
the
second
the
experiential
aspect
predominates
the
premises
of
both
cases
are
purely
matters
of
experience
and
the
formal
question
of
inference
is
a
matter
of
logic
only
at
one
time
the
first
question
at
another
the
second
comes
more
obviously
into
the
foreground
although
this
matter
appears
it
is
not
indifferent
it
is
well
known
that
whenever
we
are
powerfully
influenced
by
one
thing
things
of
little
intensity
are
either
not
experienced
at
all
or
only
to
a
very
small
degree
and
are
therefore
neglected
this
is
a
fact
which
may
indeed
be
shown
mathematically
for
infinity
plus
one
equals
infinity
when
therefore
we
undergo
great
pain
or
great
joy
any
accompanying
insignificant
pain
or
any
pleasure
will
be
barely
felt
just
as
the
horses
who
drag
a
very
heavy
wagon
will
not
notice
whether
the
driver
walking
beside
them
adds
his
coat
to
the
load
cf
law
hence
when
we
criminalists
study
a
difficult
case
with
regard
to
the
question
of
proof
there
are
two
things
to
do
in
order
to
test
the
premises
for
correctness
according
to
the
standards
of
our
other
experiences
and
to
draw
logically
correct
inferences
from
these
premises
if
it
happens
that
there
are
especial
difficulties
in
one
direction
while
by
some
chance
those
in
the
other
are
easily
removed
it
becomes
surprising
how
often
the
latter
are
entirely
ignored
and
hence
the
adjustment
of
inferences
is
naturally
false
even
when
the
great
difficulties
of
the
first
type
are
removed
correctly
therefore
if
the
establishment
of
a
fact
costs
a
good
deal
of
pains
and
means
the
expenditure
of
much
time
the
business
of
logical
connection
appears
so
comparatively
easy
that
it
is
made
swiftly
and
wrongly
mistakes
become
at
least
according
to
my
experience
still
more
frequent
when
the
difficulty
is
logical
and
not
empirical
as
a
matter
of
honesty
let
me
say
that
we
criminalists
are
not
trained
logicians
however
necessary
it
is
that
we
shall
be
such
and
most
of
us
are
satisfied
with
the
barren
remainder
of
what
we
learned
long
ago
in
the
gymnasium
and
have
since
forgotten
the
difficulties
which
occur
in
the
more
important
logical
tasks
are
intelligible
when
compared
with
the
lesser
difficulties
and
when
one
of
these
larger
problems
is
by
good
fortune
rightly
solved
the
effort
and
the
work
required
by
the
solution
make
it
easy
to
forget
asking
whether
the
premises
are
correct
they
are
assumed
as
hence
in
the
review
of
the
basis
for
judgment
it
is
often
discovered
that
the
logical
task
has
been
performed
with
care
with
the
expenditure
of
much
time
only
to
be
based
upon
some
apparently
unessential
presupposition
which
contradicts
all
experience
and
is
hence
materially
incorrect
consequence
the
inference
is
wrong
since
the
premise
was
wrong
and
the
whole
work
has
gone
for
nothing
such
occurrences
convince
one
that
no
judge
would
have
been
guilty
of
them
if
the
few
difficulties
concerning
the
fact
in
question
were
not
because
treated
in
the
light
of
the
effort
required
by
the
logical
work
quite
neglected
nor
does
this
occur
unconsciously
or
as
a
consequence
of
a
sort
of
lapse
of
memory
concerning
the
meaning
or
the
importance
of
an
empirical
problem
it
also
happens
at
least
half
consciously
by
way
of
a
characteristic
psychic
process
which
everybody
may
identify
in
his
own
experience
the
idea
occurs
in
some
degree
subconsciously
that
the
overgreatness
of
the
work
done
in
one
direction
ought
to
be
corrected
by
the
inadequacy
of
the
work
done
in
the
other
direction
and
this
happens
in
work
often
and
being
frequently
justifiable
becomes
habitual
if
i
for
example
have
examined
ten
unanimous
witnesses
concerning
the
same
event
and
have
completely
demonstrated
the
status
of
the
case
i
ought
in
examining
the
last
two
witnesses
who
are
perhaps
no
longer
needed
but
have
been
summoned
and
appear
certainly
to
proceed
in
a
rapid
manner
this
justifiable
neglect
is
then
half
unconsciously
transferred
to
other
procedures
where
there
is
possible
no
equalization
of
the
hypertrophy
of
work
in
one
direction
with
the
dwarfing
of
it
in
another
and
where
the
mistake
causes
the
result
to
be
wrong
however
i
may
have
been
bothered
by
the
multiplication
of
ten
groups
of
factors
and
whatever
accuracy
i
may
have
applied
to
a
task
can
not
permit
me
to
relax
my
attention
in
the
addition
of
the
individual
results
if
i
do
i
am
likely
to
commit
an
error
and
the
error
renders
all
the
previous
labor
worthless
indeed
it
may
be
asserted
that
all
logic
is
futile
where
the
premises
or
a
single
premise
may
be
wrong
i
expect
in
truth
that
the
procedures
here
described
will
be
doubted
to
be
even
possible
but
doubters
are
recommended
to
examine
a
few
cases
for
the
presence
of
this
sort
of
thing
section
e
analogy
analogy
is
the
least
negligible
of
all
methods
of
induction
because
it
rests
at
bottom
on
the
postulate
that
one
thing
which
has
a
number
of
qualities
in
common
with
another
will
agree
with
that
other
in
one
or
more
qualities
in
cases
of
analogy
identity
is
never
asserted
indeed
it
is
excluded
while
a
certain
parallelism
and
agreement
in
specific
points
are
assumed
introduced
tacitly
as
a
mutatis
mutandis
consider
examples
he
calls
analogy
the
transfer
of
judgment
or
the
transition
from
similar
to
similar
and
he
adds
that
the
value
of
such
a
process
is
very
variable
if
i
have
perceived
x
times
that
flowers
of
a
certain
color
have
perfume
i
am
inclined
to
expect
perfume
from
flowers
of
the
same
color
in
cases
if
i
have
observed
x
times
that
clouds
of
a
certain
structure
are
followed
by
rain
i
shall
expect
rain
in
the
case
the
first
analogy
is
worthless
because
there
is
no
relation
between
color
and
perfume
the
second
is
of
great
value
because
such
a
relation
does
exist
between
rain
and
clouds
simply
stated
the
difference
between
these
two
examples
does
not
consist
in
the
existence
of
a
relationship
in
the
one
case
and
the
absence
of
a
relationship
in
the
other
it
consists
in
the
fact
that
in
the
case
of
the
flowers
the
relationship
occurs
now
and
then
but
is
not
permanently
knowable
it
is
possible
that
there
is
a
natural
law
controlling
the
relation
between
color
and
odor
and
if
that
law
were
known
there
would
be
no
question
of
accident
or
of
analogy
but
of
law
our
ignorance
of
such
a
law
in
spite
of
the
multiplicity
of
instances
lies
in
the
fact
that
we
are
concerned
only
with
the
converse
relationships
and
not
with
the
common
cause
of
perfume
and
color
suppose
i
see
on
the
street
a
large
number
of
people
with
winter
and
a
large
number
of
people
with
skates
in
their
hands
i
would
hardly
ask
whether
the
coats
are
conditioned
or
brought
out
by
the
skates
or
the
skates
by
the
coats
if
i
do
not
conclude
that
the
cold
weather
is
the
condition
both
of
the
need
of
and
the
utility
of
skates
i
will
suppose
that
there
is
some
unintelligible
reflexive
relation
between
and
skates
if
i
observe
that
on
a
certain
day
every
week
there
regularly
appear
many
people
and
no
workingmen
on
the
street
if
i
am
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
sunday
is
the
cause
of
the
appearance
of
the
one
and
the
disappearance
of
the
other
i
shall
try
in
vain
to
find
out
how
it
happens
that
the
working
people
are
crowded
out
by
the
ones
or
conversely
the
danger
of
analogy
lies
in
the
fact
that
we
prefer
naturally
to
depend
on
something
already
known
and
that
the
preference
is
the
greater
in
proportion
to
our
feeling
of
the
strangeness
and
ominousness
of
the
particular
intellectual
or
natural
regions
in
which
we
find
ourselves
i
have
already
once
demonstrated
how
disquieting
it
is
to
notice
during
the
examination
of
the
jury
that
the
jurymen
who
ask
questions
try
to
find
some
relation
to
their
own
trades
even
though
this
requires
great
effort
and
seek
to
bring
the
case
they
are
asking
about
under
the
light
of
their
particular
profession
so
however
irrelevant
the
statement
of
a
witness
may
be
the
merchant
juryman
will
use
it
to
explain
the
carpenter
juryman
to
explain
carpentry
the
agriculturist
to
notice
the
farming
of
cattle
and
then
having
set
the
problem
in
his
own
field
construct
the
most
daring
analogies
for
use
in
determining
the
guilt
of
the
accused
and
we
lawyers
are
no
better
the
more
difficult
and
newer
a
case
is
the
more
are
we
inclined
to
seek
analogies
we
want
supports
for
we
do
not
find
firm
natural
laws
and
in
our
fear
we
reach
out
after
analogies
not
of
course
in
law
because
that
is
not
permitted
but
certainly
in
matters
of
fact
witness
x
has
given
difficult
testimony
in
a
certain
case
we
seek
an
analogy
in
witness
y
of
an
older
case
and
we
observe
the
present
issue
thus
analogically
without
the
least
justification
we
have
never
yet
seen
drops
of
blood
on
colored
carpets
yet
we
believe
in
applying
our
experience
of
blood
stains
on
clothes
and
boots
analogically
we
have
before
us
a
perfectly
novel
deed
rising
from
perverted
sexual
impulse
and
we
presuppose
that
the
accused
is
to
be
treated
altogether
analogously
to
another
in
a
different
case
although
indeed
the
whole
event
was
different
moreover
the
procedure
where
the
analogy
is
justified
is
complex
insight
says
trendelenburg
the
ancients
regard
analogy
as
important
the
power
of
analogy
lies
in
the
construction
and
induction
of
a
general
term
which
binds
the
subconcept
with
regard
to
which
a
conclusion
is
desired
together
with
the
individual
object
which
is
compared
with
the
first
and
which
is
to
appear
as
a
mediating
concept
but
can
not
this
new
general
term
is
not
however
the
highest
concept
among
the
three
termini
of
the
conclusion
it
is
the
middle
one
and
is
nothing
else
than
the
terminus
medius
of
the
first
this
clear
statement
shows
not
only
how
circumstantial
every
conclusion
from
analogy
is
but
also
how
little
it
achieves
there
is
hardly
any
doubt
of
the
fact
that
science
has
much
to
thank
analogy
for
since
analogy
is
the
simplest
and
easiest
means
for
progress
in
thought
if
anything
is
established
in
any
one
direction
but
progress
is
desired
in
another
then
the
attempt
is
made
to
adapt
what
is
known
to
the
proximate
unknown
and
to
draw
the
possible
inference
by
analogy
thousands
upon
thousands
of
analogies
have
been
attempted
and
have
failed
but
no
matter
one
successful
one
became
a
hypothesis
and
finally
an
important
natural
law
in
our
work
however
the
case
is
altogether
different
for
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
construction
of
hypotheses
we
are
concerned
with
the
discovering
of
truth
or
with
the
recognition
that
it
can
not
be
discovered
the
only
place
where
our
problems
permit
of
the
use
of
analogy
is
in
the
making
of
constructions
when
we
aim
to
clarify
or
to
begin
the
explanation
of
a
case
which
is
at
present
unintelligible
by
making
some
assumption
the
construction
then
proceeds
in
analogy
to
some
already
well
known
earlier
case
we
say
the
case
to
have
been
so
and
so
and
then
we
begin
to
test
the
assumption
by
applying
it
to
the
material
before
us
eliminating
and
constructing
progressively
until
we
get
a
consistent
result
there
is
no
doubt
that
success
is
frequently
attained
in
this
way
and
that
it
is
often
the
only
way
in
which
a
work
may
be
begun
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
recognized
how
dangerous
this
is
for
in
the
eagerness
of
the
work
it
is
easy
to
forget
that
so
far
one
is
working
only
according
to
analogy
by
means
of
an
assumption
still
to
be
proved
this
assumption
is
in
such
cases
suddenly
considered
as
something
already
proved
and
is
counted
as
such
with
the
consequence
that
the
result
must
be
false
if
you
add
the
variability
in
value
of
analogy
a
variability
not
often
immediately
recognized
the
case
becomes
still
worse
we
have
never
been
on
the
moon
have
therefore
apparently
no
right
to
judge
the
conditions
there
and
still
we
know
only
by
way
of
analogy
that
if
we
jumped
into
the
air
there
we
should
fall
back
to
the
ground
but
still
further
we
conclude
again
by
analogy
that
there
are
intelligent
beings
on
mars
if
however
we
were
to
say
how
these
people
might
look
whether
like
us
or
like
cubes
or
like
threads
whether
they
are
as
large
as
bees
or
ten
elephants
we
should
have
to
give
up
because
we
have
not
the
slightest
basis
for
analogy
in
the
last
analysis
analogy
depends
upon
the
recurrence
of
similar
conditions
therefore
we
tacitly
assume
when
we
judge
by
analogy
that
the
similarity
of
conditions
contains
an
equivalence
of
ultimately
valid
circumstance
the
certainty
of
analogy
is
as
great
as
the
certainty
of
this
postulate
and
its
right
as
great
as
the
right
of
this
postulate
if
then
the
postulate
is
little
certain
we
have
gained
nothing
and
reach
out
into
the
dark
if
its
certainty
is
great
we
no
longer
have
an
analogy
we
have
a
natural
law
hence
whately
uses
the
term
analogy
as
an
expression
for
the
similarity
of
relation
and
in
this
regard
the
use
of
analogy
for
our
real
work
has
no
special
significance
concerning
false
analogies
and
their
importance
cf
die

f
probability
inasmuch
as
the
work
of
the
criminal
judge
depends
upon
the
proof
of
evidence
it
is
conceivable
that
the
thing
for
him
most
important
is
that
which
has
evidential
character
or
force
a
sufficient
definition
of
evidence
or
proof
does
not
exist
because
no
bounds
have
been
set
to
the
meaning
of
all
disciplines
furnish
examples
of
the
fact
that
things
for
a
long
time
had
probable
validity
later
indubitable
validity
that
again
some
things
were
considered
proved
and
were
later
shown
to
be
incorrect
and
that
many
things
at
one
time
wobbly
are
in
various
places
and
even
among
particular
persons
supposed
to
be
at
the
limits
of
probability
and
proof
especially
remarkable
is
the
fact
that
the
concept
of
is
very
various
in
various
sciences
and
it
would
be
absorbing
to
establish
the
difference
between
what
is
called
proved
and
what
only
probable
in
a
number
of
given
examples
by
the
mathematician
the
physicist
the
chemist
the
physician
the
naturalist
the
philologist
the
historian
the
philosopher
the
lawyer
the
theologian
etc
but
this
is
no
task
for
us
and
nobody
is
called
upon
to
determine
who
knows
what
means
it
is
enough
to
observe
that
the
differences
are
great
and
to
understand
why
we
criminalists
have
such
various
answers
to
the
question
is
this
proved
or
only
probable
the
varieties
may
be
easily
divided
into
groups
according
to
the
mathematical
philosophic
historical
or
naturalistic
inclinations
of
the
answerer
indeed
if
the
individual
is
known
what
he
means
by
can
be
determined
beforehand
only
those
minds
that
have
no
especial
information
remain
confused
in
this
regard
both
to
others
and
to
themselves
sharply
to
define
the
notion
of
would
require
at
least
to
establish
its
relation
to
usage
and
to
say
what
we
desire
leads
us
to
an
what
is
possible
gives
us
what
appears
certain
we
call
in
this
regard
the
second
is
always
in
some
degree
the
standard
for
the
first
desires
cause
us
to
act
one
becomes
predominant
and
is
fixed
as
an
assumption
which
later
on
becomes
clothed
with
a
certain
amount
of
reliability
by
means
of
this
fixation
the
first
two
fixations
the
assumption
and
the
probability
have
in
contrast
to
their
position
among
other
sciences
only
a
heuristic
interest
to
us
criminalists
even
assumptions
when
they
become
hypotheses
have
in
various
disciplines
a
various
value
and
the
greatest
lucidity
and
the
best
work
occur
mainly
in
the
quarrel
about
an
acutely
constructed
hypothesis
has
a
similar
position
in
the
sciences
the
scholar
who
has
discovered
a
new
thought
a
new
order
explanation
or
solution
will
find
it
indifferent
whether
he
has
made
it
only
highly
probable
or
certain
he
is
concerned
only
with
the
idea
and
a
scholar
who
is
dealing
with
the
idea
for
its
own
sake
will
perhaps
prefer
to
bring
it
to
a
great
probability
rather
than
to
indubitable
certainty
for
where
conclusive
proof
is
presented
there
is
no
longer
much
interest
in
further
research
while
probability
permits
and
requires
further
study
but
our
aim
is
certainty
and
proof
only
and
even
a
high
degree
of
probability
is
no
better
than
untruth
and
can
not
count
in
passing
judgment
and
for
the
purpose
of
judgment
a
high
degree
of
probability
can
have
only
corroborative
weight
and
then
it
is
probability
only
when
taken
in
itself
and
proof
when
taken
with
regard
to
the
thing
it
corroborates
if
for
example
it
is
most
probable
that
x
was
recognized
at
the
place
of
a
crime
and
if
at
the
same
time
his
evidence
of
alibi
has
failed
his
footmarks
are
corroborative
so
are
the
stolen
goods
which
have
been
seen
in
his
possession
and
something
he
had
lost
at
the
place
of
the
crime
which
is
recognized
as
his
property
etc
in
short
when
all
these
indices
are
in
themselves
established
only
as
highly
probable
they
give
under
certain
circumstances
when
taken
together
complete
certainty
because
the
coincidence
of
so
many
high
probabilities
must
be
declared
impossible
if
x
were
not
the
criminal
in
all
other
cases
as
we
have
already
pointed
out
and
probability
have
only
a
heuristic
value
for
us
lawyers
with
the
assumption
we
must
of
course
count
many
cases
can
not
be
begun
without
the
assistance
of
assumption
every
only
case
the
process
of
which
is
unknown
requires
first
of
all
and
as
early
as
possible
the
application
of
some
assumption
to
its
material
as
soon
as
the
account
is
inconsistent
the
assumption
must
be
abandoned
and
a
fresh
one
and
yet
again
a
fresh
one
assumed
until
finally
one
holds
its
own
and
may
be
established
as
probable
it
then
remains
the
center
of
operation
until
it
becomes
of
itself
a
proof
or
as
we
have
explained
until
so
many
high
probabilities
in
various
directions
have
been
gathered
that
taken
in
their
order
they
serve
evidentially
a
very
high
degree
of
probability
is
sufficient
in
making
complaints
but
sentencing
requires
and
in
most
cases
the
struggle
between
the
prosecution
and
the
defense
and
the
doubt
of
the
judge
turns
upon
the
question
of
probability
as
against
proof
that
probability
is
in
this
way
and
in
a
number
of
relations
of
great
value
to
the
criminalist
can
not
appear
doubtful
mittermaier
defines
its
significance
briefly
naturally
can
never
lead
to
sentence
it
is
however
important
as
a
guide
for
the
conduct
of
the
examiner
as
authorizing
him
to
take
certain
measures
it
shows
how
to
attach
certain
legal
processes
in
various
suppose
that
we
review
the
history
of
the
development
of
the
theory
of
probability
the
first
to
have
attempted
a
sharp
distinction
between
demonstrable
and
probable
knowledge
was
locke
leibnitz
was
the
first
to
recognize
the
importance
of
the
theory
of
probability
for
inductive
logic
he
was
succeeded
by
the
mathematician
bernoulli
and
the
revolutionist
condorcet
the
theory
in
its
modern
form
was
studied
by
laplace
quetelet
herschel
von
kirchmann
von
kries
venn
cournot
fick
von
bortkiewicz
etc
the
concept
that
is
called
probability
varies
with
different
authorities
locke
divides
all
fundamentals
into
demonstrative
and
probable
according
to
this
classification
it
is
probable
that
men
are
mortal
and
that
sun
will
rise
but
to
be
consistent
with
ordinary
speech
the
fundamentals
must
be
classified
as
evidence
certainties
and
probabilities
by
certainties
i
understand
such
fundamentals
as
are
supported
by
experience
and
leave
no
room
for
doubt
or
consideration
everything
else
especially
as
it
permits
of
further
proof
is
more
or
less
probable
laplace
spoke
move
definitely
depends
in
part
on
our
ignorance
in
part
on
our
knowledge
theory
of
probability
consists
in
the
reduction
of
doubts
of
the
same
class
of
a
definite
number
of
equally
possible
cases
in
such
a
way
that
we
are
equally
undetermined
with
regard
to
their
existence
and
it
further
consists
in
the
determination
of
the
number
of
those
cases
which
are
favorable
to
the
result
the
probability
of
which
is
sought
the
relation
of
this
number
to
the
number
of
all
possible
cases
is
the
measure
of
the
probability
it
is
therefore
a
fraction
the
numerator
of
which
is
derived
from
the
number
of
cases
favorable
to
the
result
and
the
denominator
from
the
number
of
all
possible
laplace
therefore
with
mill
takes
probability
to
be
a
low
degree
of
certainty
while
venn
gives
it
an
objective
support
like
truth
the
last
view
has
a
great
deal
of
plausibility
inasmuch
as
there
is
considerable
doubt
whether
an
appearance
is
to
be
taken
as
certain
or
as
only
probable
if
this
question
is
explained
the
assertor
of
certainty
has
assumed
some
objective
foundation
which
is
indubitable
at
least
subjectively
fick
represents
the
establishment
of
probability
as
a
fraction
as
follows
probability
of
an
incompletely
expressed
hypothetical
judgment
is
a
real
fraction
proved
as
a
part
of
the
whole
universe
of
conditions
upon
which
the
realization
of
the
required
result
necessarily
depends
to
this
it
is
hardly
proper
to
speak
of
the
probability
of
any
result
every
individual
event
is
either
absolutely
necessary
or
impossible
the
probability
is
a
quality
which
can
pertain
only
to
a
hypothetical
that
it
is
improper
to
speak
of
the
probability
of
a
result
admits
of
no
doubt
nor
will
anybody
assert
that
the
circumstance
of
rain
is
in
itself
probable
or
improbable
the
form
of
expression
is
only
a
matter
of
usage
it
is
however
necessary
to
distinguish
between
conditioned
and
unconditioned
probability
if
i
consider
the
conditions
which
are
attached
to
the
ensuing
change
of
weather
if
i
study
the
temperature
the
barometer
the
cloud
formation
the
amount
of
sunlight
as
conditions
which
are
related
to
weather
as
its
forerunners
then
i
must
say
that
rain
is
probable
to
such
or
such
a
degree
and
the
correctness
of
my
statement
depends
upon
whether
i
know
the
conditions
under
which
rain
must
appear
more
or
less
accurately
and
completely
and
whether
i
relate
those
conditions
properly
with
regard
to
unconditioned
probabilities
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
conditions
of
weather
as
affecting
but
are
simply
observations
statistically
made
concerning
the
number
of
rainy
days
the
case
is
quite
different
the
distinction
between
these
two
cases
is
of
importance
to
the
criminalist
because
the
substitution
of
one
for
the
other
or
the
confusion
of
one
with
the
other
will
cause
him
to
confuse
and
falsely
to
interpret
the
probability
before
him
suppose
that
a
murder
has
happened
in
vienna
and
suppose
that
i
declare
immediately
after
the
crime
and
in
full
knowledge
of
the
facts
that
according
to
the
facts
according
to
the
conditions
which
lead
to
the
discovery
of
the
criminal
there
is
such
and
such
a
degree
of
probability
for
this
discovery
such
a
declaration
means
that
i
have
calculated
a
conditioned
probability
suppose
that
on
the
other
hand
i
declare
that
of
the
murders
occurring
in
vienna
in
the
course
of
ten
years
so
and
so
many
are
unexplained
with
regard
to
the
personality
of
the
criminal
so
and
so
many
were
explained
within
such
and
such
a
time
and
consequently
the
probability
of
a
discovery
in
the
case
before
us
is
so
and
so
great
in
the
latter
case
i
have
spoken
of
unconditioned
probability
unconditioned
probability
may
be
studied
by
itself
and
the
event
compared
with
it
but
it
must
never
be
counted
on
for
the
positive
cases
have
already
been
reckoned
with
in
the
unconditioned
percentage
and
therefore
should
not
be
counted
another
time
naturally
in
practice
neither
form
of
probability
is
frequently
calculated
in
figures
only
an
approximate
interpretation
of
both
is
made
suppose
that
i
hear
of
a
certain
crime
and
the
fact
that
a
footprint
has
been
found
if
without
knowing
further
details
i
cry
out
footprints
bring
little
to
light
i
have
thereby
asserted
that
the
statistical
verdict
in
such
cases
shows
an
unfavorable
percentage
of
unconditional
probability
with
regard
to
positive
results
but
suppose
that
i
have
examined
the
footprint
and
have
tested
it
with
regard
to
the
other
circumstances
and
then
declared
the
conditions
before
us
it
is
to
be
expected
that
the
footprint
will
lead
to
then
i
have
declared
to
the
conditions
the
conditioned
probability
of
a
positive
result
is
both
assertions
may
be
correct
but
it
would
be
false
to
unite
them
and
to
say
conditions
for
results
are
very
favorable
in
the
case
before
us
but
generally
hardly
anything
is
gained
by
means
of
footprints
and
hence
the
probability
in
this
case
is
this
would
be
false
because
the
few
favorable
results
as
against
the
many
unfavorable
ones
have
already
been
considered
and
have
already
determined
the
percentage
so
that
they
should
not
again
be
used
such
mistakes
are
made
particularly
when
determining
the
complicity
of
the
accused
suppose
we
say
that
the
manner
of
the
crime
makes
it
highly
probable
that
the
criminal
should
be
a
skilful
thief
our
probability
is
conditioned
now
we
proceed
to
unconditioned
probability
by
saying
is
a
fact
that
thieves
often
steal
again
and
we
have
therefore
two
reasons
for
the
assumption
that
x
of
whom
both
circumstances
are
true
was
the
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
are
dealing
with
only
one
identical
probability
which
has
merely
been
counted
in
two
ways
such
inferences
are
not
altogether
dangerous
because
their
incorrectness
is
open
to
view
but
where
they
are
more
concealed
great
harm
may
be
done
in
this
way
a
further
subdivision
of
probability
is
made
by
kirchmann
he
distinguished
general
probability
which
depends
upon
the
causes
or
consequences
of
some
single
uncertain
result
and
derives
its
character
from
them
an
example
of
the
dependence
on
causes
is
the
collective
weather
prophecy
and
of
dependence
on
consequences
is
dictum
that
because
we
see
the
stars
turn
the
earth
must
stand
still
two
sciences
especially
depend
upon
such
probabilities
history
and
law
more
properly
the
practice
and
use
of
criminal
law
information
imparted
by
men
is
used
in
both
sciences
this
information
is
made
up
of
effects
and
hence
the
occurrence
is
inferred
from
as
cause
inductive
probability
single
events
which
must
be
true
form
the
foundation
and
the
result
passes
to
a
valid
universal
especially
made
use
of
in
the
natural
sciences
in
diseases
caused
by
bacilli
in
case
x
we
find
the
appearance
a
and
in
diseases
of
like
cause
y
and
z
we
also
find
the
appearance
a
it
is
therefore
probable
that
all
diseases
caused
by
bacilli
will
manifest
the
symptom
a
mathematical
probability
this
infers
that
a
is
connected
either
with
b
or
c
or
d
and
asks
the
degree
of
probability
a
woman
is
brought
to
bed
either
with
a
boy
or
a
girl
therefore
the
probability
that
a
boy
will
be
born
is
of
these
forms
of
probability
the
first
two
are
of
equal
importance
to
us
the
third
rarely
of
value
because
we
lack
arithmetical
cases
and
because
probability
of
that
kind
is
only
of
transitory
worth
and
has
always
to
be
so
studied
as
to
lead
to
an
actual
counting
of
cases
it
is
of
this
form
of
probability
that
mill
advises
to
know
before
applying
a
calculation
of
probability
the
necessary
facts
the
relative
frequency
with
which
the
various
events
occur
and
to
understand
clearly
the
causes
of
these
events
if
statistical
tables
show
that
five
of
every
hundred
men
reach
on
an
average
seventy
years
the
inference
is
valid
because
it
expresses
the
existent
relation
between
the
causes
which
prolong
or
shorten
life
a
further
comparatively
division
is
made
by
cournot
who
separates
subjective
probability
from
the
possible
probability
pertaining
to
the
events
as
such
the
latter
is
objectively
defined
by
kries
in
the
following
example
throw
of
a
regular
die
will
reveal
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
the
same
relation
and
that
will
lead
the
mind
to
suppose
it
objectively
valid
it
hence
follows
that
the
relation
is
changed
if
the
shape
of
the
die
is
but
how
objectively
valid
relation
substantiation
of
probability
is
to
be
thought
of
remains
as
unclear
as
the
regular
results
of
statistics
do
anyway
it
is
hence
a
question
whether
anything
is
gained
when
the
form
of
calculation
is
known
kries
says
in
determining
the
laws
of
probability
have
subordinated
every
series
of
similar
cases
which
take
one
course
or
another
as
if
the
constancy
of
general
conditions
the
independence
and
chance
equivalence
of
single
events
were
identical
throughout
hence
we
find
there
are
certain
simple
rules
according
to
which
the
probability
of
a
case
may
be
calculated
from
the
number
of
successes
in
cases
observed
until
this
one
and
from
which
therefore
the
probability
for
the
appearance
of
all
similar
cases
may
be
derived
these
rules
are
established
without
any
exception
this
statement
is
not
inaccurate
because
the
general
applicability
of
the
rules
is
brought
forward
and
its
use
defended
in
cases
where
the
presuppositions
do
not
agree
hence
there
are
delusory
results
in
the
calculation
of
mortality
of
the
statements
of
witnesses
and
judicial
deliverances
these
do
not
proceed
according
to
the
schema
of
the
ordinary
play
of
accident
the
application
therefore
can
be
valid
only
if
the
constancy
of
general
conditions
may
be
reliably
assumed
but
this
evidently
is
valid
only
with
regard
to
unconditioned
probability
which
only
at
great
intervals
and
transiently
may
influence
our
practical
work
for
however
well
i
may
know
that
according
to
statistics
every
xth
witness
is
punished
for
perjury
i
will
not
be
frightened
at
the
approach
of
my
xth
witness
though
he
is
likely
according
to
statistics
to
lie
in
such
cases
we
are
not
fooled
but
where
events
are
confused
we
still
are
likely
to
forget
that
probabilities
may
be
counted
only
from
great
series
of
figures
in
which
the
experiences
of
individuals
are
quite
lost
nevertheless
figures
and
the
conditions
of
figures
with
regard
to
probability
exercise
great
influence
upon
everybody
so
great
indeed
that
we
really
must
beware
of
going
too
far
in
the
use
of
figures
mill
cites
a
case
of
a
wounded
frenchman
suppose
a
regiment
made
up
of
englishmen
and
one
frenchman
is
attacked
and
one
man
is
wounded
no
one
would
believe
the
account
that
this
one
frenchman
was
the
one
wounded
kant
says
significantly
anybody
sends
his
doctor
ducats
by
his
servant
the
doctor
certainly
supposes
that
the
servant
has
either
lost
or
otherwise
disposed
of
one
these
are
merely
probabilities
which
depend
upon
habits
so
it
may
be
supposed
that
a
handkerchief
has
been
lost
if
only
eleven
are
found
or
people
may
wonder
at
the
ordering
a
tablespoonful
every
five
quarters
of
an
hour
or
if
a
job
is
announced
with
a
year
as
salary
but
just
as
we
presuppose
that
wherever
the
human
will
played
any
part
regular
forms
will
come
to
light
so
we
begin
to
doubt
that
such
forms
will
occur
where
we
find
that
accident
natural
law
or
the
unplanned
co√∂peration
of
men
were
determining
factors
if
i
permit
anybody
to
count
up
accidentally
concurrent
things
and
he
announces
that
their
number
is
one
hundred
i
shall
probably
have
him
count
over
again
i
shall
be
surprised
to
hear
that
collection
contains
exactly
pieces
and
when
any
one
cites
a
distance
of
steps
i
will
suppose
that
he
had
made
an
approximate
estimation
but
had
not
counted
the
steps
this
fact
is
well
known
to
people
who
do
not
care
about
accuracy
or
who
want
to
give
their
statements
the
greatest
possible
appearance
of
correctness
hence
in
citing
figures
they
make
use
of
especially
irregular
numbers
etc
i
know
a
case
of
a
vote
of
jurymen
in
which
even
the
proportion
of
votes
had
to
be
rendered
probable
the
same
jury
had
to
pass
that
day
on
three
small
cases
in
the
first
case
the
proportion
was
for
against
the
second
case
showed
the
same
proportion
and
the
third
case
the
same
but
when
the
foreman
observed
the
proportion
he
announced
that
one
juryman
must
change
his
vote
because
the
same
proportion
three
times
running
would
appear
too
improbable
if
we
want
to
know
the
reason
for
our
superior
trust
in
irregularity
in
such
cases
it
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
experience
shows
nature
in
spite
of
all
her
marvelous
orderliness
in
the
large
to
be
completely
free
and
hence
irregular
in
little
things
hence
as
mill
shows
in
more
detail
we
expect
no
identity
of
form
in
nature
we
do
not
expect
next
year
to
have
the
same
order
of
days
as
this
year
and
we
never
wonder
when
some
suggestive
regularity
is
broken
by
a
new
event
once
it
was
supposed
that
all
men
were
either
black
or
white
and
then
red
men
were
discovered
in
america
now
just
exactly
such
suppositions
cause
the
greatest
difficulties
because
we
do
not
know
the
limits
of
natural
law
for
example
we
do
not
doubt
that
all
bodies
on
earth
have
weight
and
we
expect
to
find
no
exception
to
this
rule
on
reaching
some
undiscovered
island
on
our
planet
all
bodies
will
have
weight
there
as
well
as
everywhere
else
but
the
possibility
of
the
existence
of
red
men
had
to
be
granted
even
before
the
discovery
of
america
now
where
is
the
difference
between
the
propositions
all
bodies
have
weight
and
all
men
are
either
white
or
black
it
may
be
said
circularly
the
first
is
a
natural
law
and
the
second
is
not
but
why
not
might
not
the
human
body
be
so
organized
that
according
to
the
natural
law
it
would
be
impossible
for
red
men
to
exist
and
what
accurate
knowledge
have
we
of
pigmentation
has
anybody
ever
seen
a
green
horse
and
is
the
accident
that
nobody
has
ever
seen
one
to
prevent
the
discovery
of
green
horses
in
the
heart
of
africa
may
perhaps
somebody
not
breed
green
horses
by
crossings
or
other
experiments
or
is
the
existence
of
green
horses
contrary
to
some
unknown
but
invincible
natural
law
perhaps
somebody
may
have
a
green
horse
perhaps
it
is
as
impossible
as
water
running
up
hill
to
know
whether
anything
is
natural
law
or
not
always
depends
upon
the
grade
and
standing
of
our
immediate
experience
and
hence
we
shall
never
be
able
honestly
to
make
any
universal
proposition
the
only
thing
possible
is
the
greatest
possible
accurate
observation
of
probability
in
all
known
possible
cases
and
of
the
probability
of
the
discovery
of
exceptions
bacon
called
the
establishment
of
reliable
assumptions
counting
up
without
meeting
any
contradictory
case
but
what
gives
us
the
law
is
the
manner
of
counting
the
untrained
mind
accepts
facts
as
they
occur
without
taking
the
trouble
to
seek
others
the
trained
mind
seeks
the
facts
he
needs
for
the
premises
of
his
inference
as
mill
says
whatever
has
shown
itself
to
be
true
without
exception
may
be
held
universal
so
long
as
no
doubtful
exception
is
presented
and
when
the
case
is
of
such
a
nature
that
a
real
exception
could
not
escape
our
observation
this
indicates
how
we
are
to
interpret
information
given
by
others
we
hear
as
this
is
always
so
it
may
be
assumed
to
be
so
in
the
present
immediate
acceptance
of
this
proposition
would
be
as
foolhardy
as
doubt
in
the
face
of
all
the
facts
the
proper
procedure
is
to
examine
and
establish
the
determining
conditions
who
has
counted
up
this
and
what
caution
was
used
to
avoid
the
overlooking
of
any
exception
the
real
work
of
interpretation
lies
in
such
testing
we
do
not
want
to
reach
the
truth
with
one
blow
we
aim
only
to
approach
it
but
the
step
must
be
taken
and
we
must
know
how
large
it
is
to
be
and
know
how
much
closer
it
has
brought
us
to
the
truth
and
this
is
learned
only
through
knowing
who
made
the
step
and
how
it
was
made
immortal
statement
was
not
born
to
solve
the
riddle
of
the
universe
but
to
seek
out
what
the
problem
leads
to
in
order
to
keep
himself
within
the
limits
of
the
conceivable
is
valid
for
us
too
our
great
mistake
in
examining
and
judging
often
lies
in
our
setting
too
much
value
upon
individual
circumstances
and
trying
to
solve
the
problem
with
those
alone
or
in
not
daring
to
use
any
given
circumstance
sufficiently
the
latter
represents
that
stupidity
which
is
of
use
to
scientific
spirits
when
they
lack
complete
proof
of
their
points
but
is
dangerous
in
practical
affairs
as
a
rule
it
is
also
the
consequence
of
the
failure
to
evaluate
what
is
given
simply
because
one
forgets
or
is
too
lazy
to
do
so
proper
action
in
this
regard
is
especially
necessary
where
certain
legal
proceedings
have
to
occur
which
are
entitled
to
a
definite
degree
of
probability
without
requiring
certainty
preliminary
examinations
arrests
investigations
of
the
premises
etc
no
law
says
how
much
probability
is
in
such
cases
required
to
say
how
much
is
impossible
but
it
is
not
unwise
to
stick
to
the
notion
that
the
event
must
appear
true
if
not
be
proved
true
nothing
must
be
present
to
destroy
the
appearance
of
truth
as
hume
says
we
have
reason
to
trust
earlier
experiences
and
to
take
them
as
standards
of
judgment
of
future
experiences
these
reasons
may
have
the
place
of
probability
in
the
positive
determination
of
the
order
of
modern
criminal
procedure
is
not
insignificant
when
the
law
determines
upon
a
definite
number
of
jurymen
or
judges
it
is
probable
that
this
number
is
sufficient
for
the
discovery
of
the
truth
the
system
of
prosecution
establishes
as
a
probability
that
the
accused
is
the
criminal
the
idea
of
assumes
the
probability
that
after
the
passage
of
a
certain
time
punishment
becomes
illusory
and
prosecution
uncertain
and
difficult
the
institution
of
experts
depends
on
the
probability
that
the
latter
make
no
mistakes
the
warrant
for
arrest
depends
on
the
probability
that
the
accused
behaved
suspiciously
or
spoke
of
his
crime
etc
the
oath
of
the
witness
depends
on
the
probability
that
the
witness
will
be
more
likely
to
tell
the
truth
under
oath
etc
modern
criminal
procedure
involves
not
only
probabilities
but
also
various
types
of
possibility
every
appeal
has
for
its
foundation
the
possibility
of
an
incorrect
judgment
the
exclusion
of
certain
court
officials
is
based
on
the
possibility
of
prejudice
or
at
least
on
the
suspicion
of
prejudice
the
publicity
of
the
trial
is
meant
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
incorrectness
the
revision
of
a
trial
depends
on
the
possibility
that
even
legal
sentences
may
be
false
and
the
institution
of
the
defendant
lawyer
depends
upon
the
possibility
that
a
person
without
defense
may
receive
injustice
all
the
formalities
of
the
action
of
the
court
assume
the
possibility
that
without
them
improprieties
may
occur
and
the
institution
of
seizing
letters
and
messages
for
evidence
asserts
only
the
possibility
that
the
latter
contain
things
of
importance
etc
when
the
positive
dicta
of
the
law
deal
with
possibility
and
probability
in
questions
of
great
importance
the
latter
become
especially
significant
we
have
yet
to
ask
what
is
meant
by
and
what
its
relation
is
to
probability
scientifically
means
law
subjectively
taken
and
is
of
equal
significance
with
the
guiding
line
for
own
conduct
whence
it
follows
that
there
are
only
rules
of
art
and
morality
but
no
rules
of
nature
usage
does
not
imply
this
interpretation
we
say
that
as
a
rule
it
hails
only
in
the
daytime
by
way
of
exception
in
the
night
also
the
rule
for
the
appearance
of
whales
indicates
that
they
live
in
the
arctic
ocean
a
general
rule
indicates
that
bodies
that
are
especially
soluble
in
water
should
dissolve
more
easily
in
warm
than
in
cold
water
but
salt
dissolves
equally
well
in
both
again
we
say
as
a
rule
the
murderer
is
an
unpunished
criminal
it
is
a
rule
that
the
brawler
is
no
thief
and
vice
versa
the
gambler
is
as
a
rule
a
man
of
parts
etc
we
may
say
therefore
that
regularity
is
equivalent
to
customary
recurrence
and
that
whatever
serves
as
rule
may
be
expected
as
probable
if
it
be
said
that
this
or
that
happens
as
a
rule
we
may
suppose
that
it
will
repeat
itself
this
time
it
is
not
permissible
to
expect
more
but
it
frequently
happens
that
we
mistake
rules
permitting
exceptions
for
natural
laws
permitting
none
this
occurs
frequently
when
we
have
lost
ourselves
in
the
regular
occurrences
for
which
we
are
ourselves
responsible
and
suppose
that
because
things
have
been
seen
a
dozen
times
they
must
always
appear
in
the
same
way
it
happens
especially
often
when
we
have
heard
some
phenomenon
described
in
other
sciences
as
frequent
and
regular
and
then
consider
it
to
be
a
law
of
nature
in
the
latter
case
we
have
probably
not
heard
the
whole
story
nor
heard
general
validity
assigned
to
it
or
again
the
whole
matter
has
long
since
altered
lotze
wrote
almost
half
a
century
ago
that
he
had
some
time
before
made
the
statistical
observation
that
the
great
positive
discoveries
of
exact
physiology
have
an
average
life
of
about
four
years
this
noteworthy
statement
indicates
that
great
positive
discoveries
are
set
up
as
natural
laws
only
to
show
themselves
as
at
most
regular
phenomena
which
have
no
right
to
general
validity
and
what
is
true
of
physiology
is
true
of
many
other
sciences
even
of
the
great
discoveries
of
medicine
even
legal
medicine
this
therefore
should
warn
against
too
much
confidence
in
things
that
are
called
false
usage
and
comfortable
dependence
upon
a
rule
have
very
frequently
led
us
too
far
its
unreliability
is
shown
by
such
maxims
as
misses
make
a
or
stupidities
taken
together
give
a
golden
rule
of
life
or
exception
is
rule
or
the
classical
perversion
rule
that
there
are
no
rules
without
exception
is
a
rule
without
exception
hence
there
is
one
rule
without
the
unreliability
of
rules
is
further
explained
by
their
rise
from
generalization
we
must
not
generalize
as
schiel
says
until
we
have
shown
that
if
there
are
cases
which
contradict
our
generalizations
we
know
those
contradictions
in
practice
approximate
generalizations
are
often
our
only
guides
natural
law
is
too
much
conditioned
cases
of
it
too
much
involved
distinctions
between
them
too
hard
to
make
to
allow
us
to
determine
the
existence
of
a
natural
phenomenon
in
terms
of
its
natural
characteristics
as
a
part
of
the
business
of
our
daily
life
our
own
age
generalizes
altogether
too
much
observes
too
little
and
abstracts
too
rapidly
events
come
quickly
examples
appear
in
masses
and
if
they
are
similar
they
tend
to
be
generalized
to
develop
into
a
rule
while
the
exceptions
which
are
infinitely
more
important
are
unobserved
and
the
rule
once
made
leads
to
innumerable
mistakes
section
g
chance
the
psychological
significance
of
what
we
call
chance
depends
upon
the
concept
of
chance
and
the
degree
of
influence
that
we
allow
it
to
possess
in
our
thinking
what
is
generally
called
chance
and
what
is
called
chance
in
particular
cases
will
depend
to
a
significant
degree
upon
the
nature
of
the
case
in
progressive
sciences
the
laws
increase
and
the
decrease
the
latter
indeed
are
valid
only
in
particular
cases
of
the
daily
life
and
in
the
general
business
of
it
we
speak
of
chance
or
accident
when
events
cross
which
are
determined
in
themselves
by
necessary
law
but
the
law
of
the
crossing
of
which
is
unknown
if
it
is
observed
that
where
there
is
much
snow
the
animals
are
white
the
event
must
not
be
attributed
to
accident
for
the
formation
of
snow
in
high
mountains
or
in
the
north
and
its
long
stay
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
develop
according
to
special
natural
laws
and
the
colors
of
animals
do
so
no
less
but
that
these
two
orderly
series
of
facts
should
meet
requires
a
third
law
or
still
better
a
third
group
of
laws
which
though
unknown
some
time
ago
are
now
known
to
every
educated
person
for
us
lawyers
chance
and
the
interpretation
of
it
are
of
immense
importance
not
only
in
bringing
together
evidence
but
in
every
case
of
suspicion
for
the
problem
always
arises
whether
a
causal
relation
may
be
established
between
the
crime
and
the
suspect
or
whether
the
relation
is
only
accidental
related
connection
of
accumulation
of
reason
for
suspicion
all
these
terms
are
really
chance
mistaken
for
causation
on
the
knowledge
of
the
difference
between
the
one
and
the
other
depends
the
fate
of
most
evidence
and
trials
whoever
is
fortunate
enough
in
rightly
perceiving
what
chance
is
is
fortunate
in
the
conduct
of
his
trial
is
there
really
a
theory
of
chance
i
believe
that
a
direct
treatment
of
the
subject
is
impossible
the
problem
of
chance
can
be
only
approximately
explained
when
all
conceivable
of
a
given
discipline
are
brought
together
and
their
number
reduced
by
careful
search
for
definite
laws
besides
the
problem
demands
the
knowledge
of
an
extremely
rich
casuistry
by
means
of
which
on
the
one
hand
to
bring
together
the
manifoldness
of
chance
events
and
on
the
other
to
discover
order
enough
has
been
written
about
chance
but
a
systematic
treatment
of
it
must
be
entirely
theoretical
so
excellent
and
book
deals
with
relations
chance
and
cause
chance
and
law
chance
and
purpose
chance
and
concept
the
greatest
value
of
which
is
to
indicate
critically
the
various
definitions
of
the
concept
of
chance
even
though
there
is
no
definition
which
presents
the
concept
of
chance
in
a
completely
satisfactory
manner
the
making
of
such
definitions
is
still
of
value
because
one
side
of
chance
is
explained
and
the
other
is
thereby
seen
more
closely
let
us
consider
a
few
of
these
and
other
definitions
aristotle
says
that
the
accidental

œÄŒ±œÅ·ºÅ
œÜ·ΩëœÉŒΩ

to

epicurus
who
sees
the

unconditioned

derives
the
idea
of
chance
from
the
life
of
nomadic
tribes
which
contains
nothing
firm
and
regulated
according
to
trendelenburg
chance
is
that
which
could
not
be
otherwise
rosenkranz
says
chance
is
a
reality
which
has
only
the
value
of
possibility
while
fischer
calls
chance
the
individualized
fact
and
lotze
identifies
it
with
everything
that
is
not
valid
as
a
natural
purpose
for
windelband
consists
according
to
usage
in
the
merely
factual
but
not
necessary
transition
from
a
possibility
to
an
actuality
chance
is
the
negation
of
necessity
it
is
a
contradiction
to
say
happened
by
accident
for
the
word
expressed
a
h√∂fler
says
most
intelligently
that
the
contradiction
of
the
idea
of
chance
by
the
causal
law
may
be
easily
solved
by
indicating
the
especial
relativity
of
the
concept
accidental
with
regard
to
one
but
otherwise
appearing
as
a
possible
causal
series
the
lesson
of
these
definitions
is
obvious
what
we
call
chance
plays
a
great
role
in
our
legal
work
on
our
recognizing
a
combination
of
circumstances
as
accidental
the
result
of
the
trial
in
most
cases
depends
and
the
distinction
between
accident
and
law
depends
upon
the
amount
of
knowledge
concerning
the
events
of
the
daily
life
especially
now
the
use
of
this
knowledge
in
particular
cases
consists
in
seeking
out
the
causal
relation
in
a
series
of
events
which
are
adduced
as
proof
and
in
turning
accident
into
order
or
in
cases
where
the
law
which
unites
or
separates
the
events
can
not
be
discovered
it
may
consist
in
the
very
cautious
interpretation
of
the
combination
of
events
on
the
principle

the

or

mittermaier
calls
conviction
a
condition
in
which
our
depends
on
full
satisfactory
grounds
of
which
we
are
aware
but
this
state
of
conviction
is
a
goal
to
be
reached
and
our
work
is
not
done
until
the
convincing
material
has
been
provided
seeking
the
truth
is
not
enough
karl
gerock
assures
us
that
no
philosophical
system
offers
us
the
full
and
finished
truth
but
there
is
a
truth
for
the
idealist
and
to
ask
blas√©
question
is
as
lessing
suggests
rendering
the
answer
impossible
but
this
shows
the
difference
between
scientific
and
practical
work
science
may
be
satisfied
with
seeking
truth
but
we
must
possess
truth
if
it
were
true
that
truth
alone
is
convincing
there
would
not
be
much
difficulty
and
one
might
be
content
that
one
is
convinced
only
by
what
is
correct
but
this
is
not
the
case
statistically
numbers
are
supposed
to
prove
but
actually
numbers
prove
according
to
their
uses
so
in
the
daily
life
we
say
facts
are
proofs
when
it
would
be
more
cautious
to
say
facts
are
proofs
according
to
their
uses
it
is
for
this
reason
that
sophistical
dialectic
is
possible
arrange
the
facts
in
one
way
and
you
reach
one
result
arrange
the
facts
another
way
and
you
may
reach
the
opposite
or
again
if
you
study
the
facts
in
doubtful
cases
honestly
and
without
prejudice
you
find
how
many
possible
conclusions
may
be
drawn
according
to
their
arrangement
we
must
of
course
not
have
in
mind
that
conviction
and
persuasion
which
is
brought
about
by
the
use
of
many
words
we
have
to
consider
only
that
adduction
of
facts
and
explanation
simple
or
complex
in
a
more
or
less
skilful
intentional
or
unintentional
manner
by
means
of
which
we
are
convinced
at
least
for
a
moment
the
variety
of
such
conviction
is
well
known
to
experience

habitual
superficiality

observation
and
impiety
against
the
essential
character
of
particular
facts
children
know
as
completely
determined
and
certain
a
great
deal
which
is
doubtful
to
the
mature
volkmar
so
frequently
the
simplest
thing
we
are
told
gets
its
value
from
the
manner
of
telling
or
from
the
person
of
the
narrator
and
inasmuch
as
we
ourselves
are
much
more
experienced
and
skilful
in
arranging
and
grouping
facts
than
are
our
witnesses
and
the
accused
it
often
happens
that
we
persuade
these
people
and
that
is
the
matter
which
wants
consideration
nobody
will
assert
that
it
will
occur
to
any
judge
to
persuade
a
witness
to
anything
which
he
does
not
thoroughly
believe
but
we
know
how
often
we
persuade
ourselves
to
some
matter
and
nothing
is
more
conceivable
than
that
we
might
like
to
see
other
people
agree
with
us
about
it
i
believe
that
the
criminalist
because
let
us
say
of
his
power
as
a
rule
takes
his
point
of
view
too
lightly
every
one
of
us
no
doubt
has
often
begun
his
work
in
a
small
and
inefficient
manner
has
brought
it
along
with
mistakes
and
scantiness
and
when
finally
he
has
reached
a
somewhat
firm
ground
he
has
been
convinced
by
his
failures
and
mistakes
of
his
ignorance
and
inadequacy
then
he
expected
that
this
conviction
would
be
obvious
also
to
other
people
whom
he
was
examining
but
this
obviousness
is
remarkably
absent
and
all
the
mistakes
cruelties
and
miscarriages
of
justice
have
not
succeeded
in
robbing
it
of
the
dignity
it
possesses
in
the
eyes
of
the
nation
perhaps
the
goodwill
which
may
be
presupposed
ought
to
be
substituted
for
the
result
but
it
is
a
fact
that
the
layman
presupposes
much
more
knowledge
acuteness
and
power
in
the
criminalist
than
he
really
possesses
then
again
it
is
conceivable
that
a
single
word
spoken
by
the
judge
has
more
weight
than
it
should
have
and
then
when
a
real
persuasion
evidently
in
the
best
sense
of
the
word
is
made
use
of
it
be
influential
i
am
certain
that
every
one
of
us
has
made
the
frightful
observation
that
by
the
end
of
the
examination
the
witness
has
simply
taken
the
point
of
view
of
the
examiner
and
the
worst
thing
about
this
is
that
the
witness
still
thinks
that
he
is
thinking
in
his
own
way
the
examiner
knows
the
matter
in
its
relation
much
better
knows
how
to
express
it
more
beautifully
and
sets
pretty
theories
going
the
witness
to
whom
the
questions
are
suggestive
becomes
conceited
likes
to
think
that
he
himself
has
brought
the
matter
out
so
excellently
and
therefore
is
pleased
to
adopt
the
point
of
view
and
the
theories
of
the
examiner
who
has
in
reality
gone
too
far
in
his
eagerness
there
is
less
danger
of
this
when
educated
people
are
examined
for
these
are
better
able
to
express
themselves
or
again
when
women
are
examined
for
these
are
too
obstinate
to
be
persuaded
but
with
the
great
majority
the
danger
is
great
and
therefore
the
criminalist
can
not
be
told
too
often
how
necessary
it
is
that
he
shall
meet
his
witness
with
the
least
conceivable
use
of
eloquence
forensic
persuasion
is
of
especial
importance
and
has
been
considered
so
since
classical
days
whether
rightly
is
another
question
the
orations
of
state
prosecutors
and
lawyers
for
the
defense
when
made
before
scholarly
judges
need
not
be
held
important
if
individuals
are
ever
asked
whether
they
were
persuaded
or
made
doubtful
by
the
prosecutor
or
his
opponent
they
indicate
very
few
instances
a
scholarly
and
experienced
judge
who
has
not
drawn
any
conclusions
about
the
case
until
the
evidence
was
all
in
need
hardly
pay
much
attention
to
the
pleaders
it
may
indeed
be
that
the
prosecution
or
defense
may
belittle
or
intensify
one
or
another
bit
of
evidence
which
the
bench
might
not
have
thought
of
or
they
may
call
attention
to
some
reason
for
severity
or
mercy
but
on
the
one
hand
if
this
is
important
it
will
already
have
been
touched
in
the
adduction
of
evidence
and
on
the
other
hand
such
points
are
generally
banal
and
indifferent
to
the
real
issue
in
the
case
if
this
be
not
so
it
would
only
indicate
that
either
we
need
a
larger
number
of
judges
or
even
when
there
are
many
judges
that
one
thing
or
another
may
be
overlooked
but
with
regard
to
the
jury
the
case
is
quite
different
it
is
easily
influenced
and
more
than
makes
up
for
the
indifference
of
the
bench
whoever
takes
the
trouble
to
study
the
faces
of
the
jury
during
trial
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
the
speeches
of
the
prosecution
and
defense
are
the
most
important
things
in
the
trial
that
they
absorb
most
of
the
attention
of
the
jury
and
that
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
does
not
depend
upon
the
number
and
weight
of
the
testimony
but
upon
the
more
or
less
skilful
interpretation
of
it
this
is
a
reproach
not
to
the
jury
but
to
those
who
demand
from
it
a
service
it
can
not
render
it
is
first
necessary
to
understand
how
difficult
the
conduct
of
a
trial
is
in
itself
the
conduct
of
a
jury
trial
is
no
art
and
when
compared
with
other
tasks
demanded
of
the
criminalist
may
be
third
or
fourth
in
difficulty
what
is
difficult
is
the
determination
of
the
chronological
order
in
which
to
present
evidence
the
drawing
of
the
brief
if
the
brief
is
well
drawn
everything
develops
logically
and
psychologically
in
a
good
way
and
the
case
goes
on
well
but
it
is
a
great
and
really
artistic
task
to
draw
this
brief
properly
there
are
only
two
possibilities
if
the
thing
is
not
done
or
the
brief
is
of
no
use
the
case
goes
on
irrelevantly
illogically
and
unintelligibly
and
the
jury
can
not
understand
what
is
happening
if
the
trick
is
turned
however
then
like
every
art
it
requires
preparation
and
intelligence
and
the
jury
do
not
possess
these
so
that
the
most
beautiful
work
of
art
passes
by
them
without
effect
they
therefore
must
turn
their
attention
to
save
what
can
be
saved
upon
the
orations
of
the
prosecution
and
defense
these
reproduce
the
evidence
for
them
in
some
intelligible
fashion
and
the
verdict
will
be
innocence
or
guilt
according
to
the
greater
intelligence
of
one
or
the
other
of
the
contending
parties
persuasiveness
at
its
height
hume
tells
us
leaves
little
room
for
intelligence
and
consideration
it
addresses
itself
entirely
to
the
imagination
and
the
affections
captures
the
auditors
and
dominates
their
understanding
fortunately
this
height
is
rarely
reached
in
any
event
this
height
which
also
dominates
those
who
know
the
subject
will
always
be
rare
yet
the
jury
are
not
people
of
knowledge
and
hence
dominations
ensue
even
through
attempts
at
persuasiveness
which
have
attained
no
height
whatever
hence
the
great
danger
the
only
help
against
this
is
in
the
study
by
the
presiding
justice
not
as
lawyer
but
as
psychologist
of
the
faces
of
the
jury
while
the
contending
lawyers
make
their
addresses
he
must
observe
very
narrowly
and
carefully
every
influence
exercised
by
the
speeches
which
is
irrelevant
to
the
real
problem
and
then
in
summing
up
call
it
to
the
attention
of
the
jury
and
bring
them
back
to
the
proper
point
of
view
the
ability
to
do
this
is
very
marvelous
but
it
again
is
an
exceedingly
difficult
performance
nowadays
persuadability
is
hardly
more
studied
but
anybody
who
has
empirically
attained
some
proficiency
in
it
has
acquired
the
same
tricks
that
are
taught
by
theory
but
these
must
be
known
if
they
are
to
be
met
effectively
hence
the
study
of
the
proper
authors
can
not
be
too
much
recommended
without
considering
the
great
authors
of
the
classical
period
especially
aristotle
and
cicero
there
are
many
modern
ones
who
might
be
named
section
i
inference
and
judgment
the
judgment
to
be
discussed
in
the
following
section
is
not
the
judgment
of
the
court
but
the
more
general
judgment
which
occurs
in
any
perception
if
we
pursue
our
tasks
earnestly
we
draw
from
the
simplest
cases
innumerable
inferences
and
we
receive
as
many
inferences
from
those
we
examine
the
correctness
of
our
work
depends
upon
the
truth
of
both
i
have
already
indicated
how
very
much
of
the
daily
life
passes
as
simple
and
invincible
even
into
the
determination
of
a
sentence
although
it
is
often
no
more
than
a
very
complicated
series
of
inferences
each
of
which
may
involve
a
mistake
even
if
the
perception
itself
has
been
correct
the
frequency
with
which
an
inference
is
made
from
is
the
more
astonishing
inasmuch
as
it
exceeds
all
that
the
general
and
otherwise
valid
law
of
laziness
permits
in
fact
it
contradicts
that
law
though
perhaps
it
may
not
do
so
for
a
hasty
inference
from
insufficient
premises
may
be
much
more
comfortable
than
more
careful
observation
and
study
such
hasty
inference
is
made
even
with
regard
to
the
most
insignificant
things
in
the
course
of
an
investigation
we
discover
that
we
have
been
dealing
only
with
inferences
and
that
our
work
therefore
has
been
for
nothing
then
again
we
miss
that
fact
and
our
results
are
false
and
their
falsehood
is
rarely
sought
in
these
petty
mistakes
so
the
witness
may
have
a
watch
in
such
and
such
a
place
when
in
reality
he
has
only
heard
a
noise
that
he
took
for
the
ticking
of
a
watch
and
hence
that
there
had
really
been
a
watch
that
he
had
seen
it
and
finally
that
he
had
seen
it
another
witness
asserts
that
x
has
many
chickens
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
has
heard
two
chickens
cluck
and
infers
a
large
number
still
another
has
seen
footprints
of
cattle
and
speaks
of
a
herd
or
he
knows
the
exact
time
of
a
murder
because
at
a
given
time
he
heard
somebody
sigh
etc
there
would
be
little
difficulty
if
people
told
us
how
they
had
inferred
for
then
a
test
by
means
of
careful
questions
would
be
easy
enough
but
they
do
not
tell
and
when
we
examine
ourselves
we
discover
that
we
do
exactly
the
same
thing
and
often
believe
and
assert
that
we
have
seen
or
heard
or
smelt
or
felt
although
we
have
only
inferred
these
things
here
belong
all
cases
of
correct
or
partly
correct
inference
and
of
false
inference
from
false
i
recall
the
story
in
which
a
whole
judicial
commission
smelt
a
disgusting
odor
while
a
coffin
was
being
exhumed
only
to
discover
that
it
was
empty
if
the
coffin
for
one
reason
or
another
had
not
been
opened
all
those
present
would
have
taken
oath
that
they
had
an
indubitable
perception
although
the
latter
was
only
inferred
from
its
precedent
condition
exner
cites
the
excellent
example
in
which
a
mother
becomes
frightened
while
her
child
cries
not
because
the
cry
as
such
sounds
so
terrible
as
because
of
its
combination
with
the
consciousness
that
it
comes
from
her
own
child
and
that
something
might
have
happened
to
it
it
is
asserted
and
i
think
rightly
that
verbal
associations
have
a
considerable
share
in
such
cases
as
stricker
expresses
it
the
form
of
any
conceptual
complex
whatever
brings
out
its
appropriate
word
if
we
see
the
watch
we
get
the
watch
if
we
see
a
man
with
a
definite
symptom
of
consumption
the
word
tuberculosis
occurs
at
once
the
last
example
is
rather
more
significant
because
when
the
whole
complex
appears
mistakes
are
more
remote
than
when
merely
one
or
another
symptom
permits
the
appearance
of
the
word
in
question
what
is
safe
to
one
mind
need
not
be
so
to
another
and
the
notion
as
to
the
certainty
of
any
symptom
changes
with
time
and
place
and
person
mistakes
are
especially
possible
when
people
are
so
certain
of
their
symptoms
that
they
do
not
examine
how
they
inferred
from
them
this
inference
however
is
directly
related
to
the
appearance
of
the
word
return
to
the
example
mentioned
above
and
suppose
that
a
has
discovered
a
symptom
of
consumption
in
b
and
the
word
tuberculosis
occurs
to
him
but
the
occurrence
does
not
leave
him
with
the
word
merely
there
is
a
direct
inference
has
we
never
begin
anything
with
the
word
alone
we
attach
it
immediately
to
some
fact
and
in
the
present
case
it
has
become
as
usual
a
judgment
the
of
him
who
has
heard
this
judgment
however
turns
backward
and
he
supposes
that
the
judge
has
had
a
long
series
of
from
which
he
has
derived
his
inference
and
in
fact
he
has
had
only
one
perception
the
reliability
of
which
is
often
questionable
then
there
is
the
additional
difficulty
that
in
every
inference
there
are
leaps
made
by
each
inferer
according
to
his
character
and
training
and
the
maker
does
not
consider
whether
the
other
fellow
can
make
similar
leaps
or
whether
his
route
is
different
when
an
english
philosopher
says
really
ought
not
to
expect
that
the
manufacture
of
woolens
shall
be
perfected
by
a
nation
which
knows
no
astronomy
we
are
likely
to
say
that
the
sentence
is
silly
another
might
say
that
it
is
paradoxical
and
a
third
that
it
is
quite
correct
for
what
is
missing
is
merely
the
proposition
that
the
grade
of
culture
made
possible
by
astronomy
is
such
as
to
require
textile
proficiency
also
conversation
the
simplest
case
of
skipping
is
where
the
conclusion
is
drawn
directly
from
the
minor
premise
but
many
other
inferences
are
omitted
as
in
the
case
of
real
thinking
in
giving
information
there
is
review
of
the
thinking
of
other
people
women
and
untrained
people
do
not
do
this
and
hence
the
disconnectedness
of
their
in
this
fact
is
the
danger
in
examining
witnesses
inasmuch
as
we
involuntarily
interpolate
the
missing
details
in
the
skipping
inferences
but
do
it
according
to
our
own
knowledge
of
the
facts
hence
a
test
of
the
correctness
of
the
other
inference
becomes
either
quite
impossible
or
is
developed
coarsely
in
the
careful
observation
of
leaping
inferences
made
by
witnesses
and
not
merely
by
women
and
the
uneducated
it
will
be
seen
that
the
inference
one
might
oneself
make
might
either
have
been
different
or
have
proceeded
in
a
different
way
if
then
all
the
premises
are
tested
a
different
result
from
that
of
the
witness
is
obtained
it
is
well
known
how
identical
premises
permit
of
different
conclusions
by
different
people
in
such
inferences
certain
remarkable
things
occur
which
as
a
rule
have
a
given
relation
to
the
occupation
of
the
witness
so
people
inclined
to
mathematics
make
the
greatest
leaps
and
though
these
may
be
comparatively
and
frequently
correct
the
danger
of
mistake
is
not
insignificant
when
the
mathematician
deals
in
his
mathematical
fashion
with
unmathematical
things
another
danger
lies
in
the
testimony
of
witnesses
who
have
a
certain
sense
of
form
in
representation
and
whose
inferential
leaps
consists
in
their
omitting
the
detailed
expression
and
in
inserting
the
notion
of
form
instead
i
learned
of
this
notable
psychosis
from
a
bookkeeper
of
a
large
factory
who
had
to
provide
for
the
test
of
numberless
additions
it
was
his
notion
that
if
we
were
to
add
two
and
three
are
five
and
six
are
eleven
and
seven
are
eighteen
we
should
never
finish
adding
and
since
the
avoidance
of
mistakes
requires
such
adding
we
must
so
contrive
that
the
image
of
two
and
three
shall
immediately
call
forth
the
image
of
five
now
this
mental
image
of
five
is
added
with
the
actual
six
and
gives
eleven
etc
according
to
this
we
do
not
add
we
see
only
a
series
of
images
and
so
rapidly
that
we
can
follow
with
a
pencil
but
slowly
and
the
images
are
so
certain
that
mistake
is
impossible
know
how
looks
well
just
as
certainly
we
know
what
the
image
of
and
is
like
the
image
of
occurs
without
this
as
it
happens
is
a
procedure
possible
only
to
a
limited
type
but
this
type
occurs
not
only
among
bookkeepers
when
any
one
of
such
persons
unites
two
events
he
does
not
consider
what
may
result
from
such
a
union
he
sees
if
i
may
say
so
only
a
resulting
image
this
image
however
is
not
so
indubitably
certain
as
in
the
case
of
numbers
and
it
may
take
all
kinds
of
forms
the
correctness
of
which
is
not
altogether
probable
the
witness
sees
two
forms
in
the
dark
and
the
flash
of
a
knife
and
hears
a
cry
if
he
belongs
to
the
type
under
discussion
he
does
not
consider
that
he
might
have
been
so
frightened
by
the
flashing
knife
as
to
have
cried
out
or
that
he
had
himself
proceeded
to
attack
with
a
stick
and
that
the
other
fellow
did
the
yelling
or
that
a
stab
or
cut
had
preceded
the
cry
no
he
saw
the
image
of
the
two
forms
and
the
knife
and
he
heard
the
cry
and
these
leap
together
into
an
image
one
of
the
forms
has
a
cut
above
his
brow
and
these
leaps
occur
so
swiftly
and
with
such
assurance
that
the
witness
in
question
often
believes
himself
to
have
seen
what
he
infers
and
swears
to
it
there
are
a
great
many
similar
processes
at
the
bottom
of
impressions
that
depend
only
upon
swift
and
unconscious
inference
suppose
that
i
am
shown
the
photograph
of
a
small
section
of
a
garden
through
which
a
team
is
passing
although
i
observe
the
image
of
only
a
small
portion
of
the
garden
and
therefore
have
no
notion
of
its
extent
still
in
speaking
of
it
i
shall
probably
speak
of
a
very
big
garden
i
have
inferred
swiftly
and
unconsciously
that
in
the
fact
that
a
wagon
and
horses
were
present
in
the
pictured
portion
of
the
garden
is
implied
great
width
of
road
for
even
gardens
of
average
size
do
not
have
such
wide
roads
as
to
admit
wagons
the
latter
occurring
only
in
parks
and
great
gardens
hence
my
conclusion
the
garden
must
be
very
big
such
inferences
are
frequent
whence
the
question
as
to
the
source
and
the
probability
of
the
information
whether
it
is
positive
or
only
an
impression
evidently
such
an
impression
may
be
correct
it
will
be
correct
often
inasmuch
as
impressions
occur
only
when
inferences
have
been
made
and
tested
repeatedly
but
it
is
necessary
in
any
case
to
review
the
sequence
of
inferences
which
led
to
this
impression
and
to
examine
their
correctness
unfortunately
the
witness
is
rarely
aware
whether
he
has
perceived
or
merely
inferred
examination
is
especially
important
when
the
impression
has
been
made
after
the
observation
of
a
few
marks
or
only
a
single
one
and
not
very
essential
one
at
that
in
the
example
of
the
team
the
impression
may
have
been
attained
by
inference
but
frequently
it
will
have
been
attained
through
some
unessential
purely
personal
determinative
characteristic
as
the
ancient
guest
recognizes
his
friend
by
fitting
halves
of
the
ring
so
we
recognize
the
object
and
its
constitution
from
one
single
characteristic
and
hence
the
whole
vision
of
it
is
vivified
by
that
all
this
is
very
well
if
no
mistakes
are
made
when
tertullian
said
quia
impossibile
est
we
will
allow
honesty
of
statement
to
this
great
scholar
especially
as
he
was
speaking
about
matters
of
religion
but
when
socrates
said
of
the
works
of
heraclitus
the
obscure
i
understand
of
it
is
good
i
think
that
what
i
do
not
understand
is
also
he
was
not
in
earnest
now
the
case
of
many
people
who
are
not
as
wise
as
tertullian
and
socrates
is
identical
with
theirs
numerous
examinations
of
witnesses
made
me
think
of
maxim
for
the
testimonies
presented
the
most
improbable
things
as
facts
and
when
they
even
explained
the
most
unintelligible
things
i
thought
what
you
do
not
understand
is
also
this
belief
of
uncultured
people
in
their
own
intelligence
has
been
most
excellently
portrayed
by
wieland
in
his
immortal
the
fourth
philosopher
says
you
call
the
world
is
essentially
an
infinite
series
of
worlds
which
envelop
one
another
like
the
skin
of
an
clear
said
the
abderites
and
thought
they
understood
the
philosopher
because
they
knew
perfectly
well
what
an
onion
looked
like
the
inference
which
is
drawn
from
the
comprehension
of
one
term
in
a
comparison
to
the
comprehension
of
the
other
is
one
of
the
most
important
reasons
for
the
occurrence
of
so
many
misunderstandings
the
example
as
such
is
understood
but
its
application
to
the
assertion
and
the
question
whether
the
latter
is
also
made
clear
by
the
example
are
forgotten
this
explains
the
well
known
and
supreme
power
of
examples
and
comparisons
and
hence
the
wise
of
all
times
have
used
comparisons
in
speaking
to
the
poor
in
spirit
hence
too
the
great
effect
of
comparisons
and
also
the
numerous
and
coarse
misunderstandings
and
the
effort
of
the
untrained
and
unintelligent
to
clarify
those
things
they
do
not
understand
by
means
of
comparisons
fortunately
they
have
in
trying
to
explain
the
thing
to
other
people
the
habit
of
making
use
of
these
difficultly
discovered
comparisons
so
that
the
others
if
they
are
only
sufficiently
observant
may
succeed
in
testing
the
correctness
of
the
inference
from
one
term
in
a
comparison
to
the
other
we
do
this
frequently
in
examining
witnesses
and
we
discover
that
the
witness
has
made
use
of
a
figure
to
clarify
some
unintelligible
point
and
that
he
necessarily
understands
it
since
it
lies
within
the
field
of
his
instruments
of
thought
but
what
is
compared
remains
as
confused
to
him
as
before
the
test
of
it
therefore
is
very
tiring
and
mainly
without
results
because
one
rarely
succeeds
in
liberating
a
man
from
some
figure
discovered
with
difficulty
he
always
returns
to
it
because
he
understands
it
though
really
not
what
he
compares
but
what
is
gained
in
such
a
case
is
not
little
for
the
certainty
that
so
revealed
the
witness
does
not
understand
the
matter
in
hand
easily
determines
the
value
of
his
testimony
the
fullness
of
the
possibilities
under
which
anything
may
be
asserted
is
also
of
importance
in
this
matter
the
inference
that
a
thing
is
impossible
is
generally
made
by
most
people
in
such
wise
that
they
first
consider
the
details
of
the
eventualities
they
already
know
or
immediately
present
then
when
these
are
before
them
they
infer
that
the
matter
is
quite
impossible
and
whether
one
or
more
different
eventualities
have
missed
of
consideration
is
not
studied
at
all
our
kindly
professor
of
physics
once
told
us
i
intended
to
show
you
the
beautiful
experiments
in
the
interference
of
light
but
it
can
not
be
observed
in
daylight
and
when
i
draw
the
curtains
you
raise
the
demonstration
is
therefore
impossible
and
i
take
the
instruments
the
good
man
did
not
consider
the
other
eventuality
that
we
might
be
depended
upon
to
behave
decently
even
if
the
curtains
were
drawn
hence
the
rule
that
a
assertion
that
a
thing
is
impossible
must
never
be
trusted
take
the
simplest
example
the
witness
assures
us
that
it
is
impossible
for
a
theft
to
have
been
committed
by
some
stranger
from
outside
if
you
ask
him
why
he
will
probably
tell
you
the
door
was
bolted
and
the
windows
the
eventuality
that
the
thief
might
have
entered
by
way
of
the
chimney
or
have
sent
a
child
between
the
bars
of
the
window
or
have
made
use
of
some
peculiar
instrument
are
not
considered
and
would
not
be
if
the
question
concerning
the
ground
of
the
inference
had
not
been
put
we
must
especially
remember
that
we
criminalists
not
dally
with
mathematical
truth
but
must
seek
historical
truth
we
start
with
a
mass
of
details
unite
them
and
succeed
by
means
of
this
union
and
test
in
attaining
a
result
which
permits
us
to
judge
the
existence
and
the
characteristics
of
past
the
material
of
our
work
lies
in
the
mass
of
details
and
the
manner
and
reliability
of
its
presentation
determines
the
certainty
of
our
inferences
seen
more
closely
the
winning
of
this
material
may
be
described
as
hume
describes
it
we
would
satisfy
ourselves
therefore
concerning
the
nature
of
that
evidence
which
assures
us
of
matters
of
fact
we
must
inquire
how
we
arrive
at
the
knowledge
of
cause
and
effect
i
shall
venture
to
affirm
as
a
general
proposition
which
admits
of
no
exception
that
the
knowledge
of
this
relation
is
not
in
any
instance
attained
by
reasonings
a
priori
but
arises
entirely
from
experience
when
we
find
that
any
particular
objects
are
constantly
conjoined
with
each
other
nor
can
our
reason
unassisted
by
experience
ever
draw
any
inference
concerning
real
existence
and
matter
of
in
the
course
of
his
explanation
hume
presents
two
propositions
i
have
found
that
such
an
object
has
always
been
attended
with
such
an
effect
i
foresee
that
other
objects
which
are
in
appearance
similar
will
be
attended
with
similar
effects
he
goes
on
shall
allow
if
you
please
that
the
one
proposition
may
justly
be
inferred
from
the
other
i
know
in
fact
that
it
always
is
inferred
but
if
you
insist
that
the
inference
is
made
by
a
chain
of
reasoning
i
desire
you
to
produce
that
chain
of
reasoning
the
connection
between
these
propositions
is
not
intuitive
there
is
required
a
medium
which
may
enable
the
mind
to
draw
such
an
inference
if
indeed
it
be
drawn
by
reasoning
and
argument
what
the
medium
is
i
must
confess
passes
my
comprehension
and
it
is
incumbent
on
those
to
produce
it
who
assert
that
it
exists
and
is
the
origin
of
all
our
conclusions
concerning
matters
of
if
we
regard
the
matter
more
closely
we
may
say
with
certainty
this
medium
exists
not
as
a
substance
but
as
a
transition
when
i
speak
in
the
proposition
of
an
object
i
already
have
in
mind
inasmuch
as
there
is
nothing
absolutely
like
anything
else
and
when
i
say
in
the
first
proposition
an
object
i
have
already
passed
into
the
assertion
made
in
the
second
proposition
suppose
that
we
take
these
propositions
concretely
i
have
discovered
that
bread
made
of
corn
has
a
nourishing
effect
i
foresee
that
other
apparently
similar
objects
wheat
will
have
a
like
effect
i
could
not
make
various
experiments
with
the
same
corn
in
case
i
could
handle
corn
taken
as
such
from
one
point
of
view
or
considered
as
such
from
another
i
could
only
experiment
with
very
similar
objects
i
can
therefore
make
these
experiments
with
corn
from
progressively
remoter
starting
points
or
soils
and
finally
with
corn
from
barbary
and
east
africa
so
that
there
can
no
longer
be
any
question
of
identity
but
only
of
similarity
and
finally
i
can
compare
two
harvests
of
corn
which
have
less
similarity
than
certain
species
of
corn
and
certain
species
of
wheat
i
am
therefore
entitled
to
speak
of
identical
or
similar
in
the
first
proposition
as
much
as
in
the
second
one
proposition
has
led
into
another
and
the
connection
between
them
has
been
discovered
the
criminological
importance
of
this
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
correctness
of
our
inferences
depends
upon
its
discovery
we
work
continuously
with
these
two
humian
propositions
and
we
always
make
our
assertion
first
that
some
things
are
related
as
cause
and
effect
and
we
join
the
present
case
to
that
because
we
consider
it
similar
if
it
is
really
similar
and
the
connection
of
the
first
and
the
second
proposition
are
actually
correct
the
truth
of
the
inference
is
attained
we
need
not
count
the
unexplained
wonders
of
numerical
relations
in
the
result
asserts
seems
as
if
there
were
some
law
of
nature
which
more
frequently
prevents
the
occurrence
of
regular
than
irregular
combinations
those
of
the
first
kind
are
mathematically
but
not
physically
more
probable
when
we
see
that
high
numbers
are
thrown
with
some
one
die
we
are
immediately
inclined
to
call
that
die
and
john
stuart
mill
adds
that
should
have
set
the
problem
in
the
form
of
asking
whether
he
would
believe
in
the
die
if
after
having
examined
it
and
found
it
right
somebody
announced
that
ten
sixes
had
been
cast
with
it
we
may
go
still
further
and
assert
that
we
are
generally
inclined
to
consider
an
inference
wrong
which
indicates
that
accidental
matters
have
occurred
in
regular
numerical
relation
who
believes
the
story
that
he
has
shot
hares
in
the
past
week
or
the
that
he
has
won
dollars
or
the
sick
that
he
was
sick
ten
times
it
will
be
supposed
at
the
very
least
that
each
is
merely
indicating
an
approximately
round
sum
hares
dollars
and
eleven
illnesses
will
sound
more
probable
and
this
goes
so
far
that
during
examinations
witnesses
are
shy
of
naming
such
ratios
if
they
at
all
care
to
have
their
testimony
believed
then
again
many
judges
are
in
no
wise
slow
to
jump
at
such
a
number
and
to
demand
an
statement
or
even
immediately
to
decide
that
the
witness
is
talking
only
how
such
views
are
is
indicated
by
the
circumstance
that
bankers
and
other
merchants
of
lottery
tickets
find
that
tickets
with
are
difficult
to
sell
a
ticket
of
series
number
is
altogether
unsalable
for
such
a
number
not
possibly
be
then
again
if
one
has
to
count
up
a
column
of
accidental
figures
and
the
sum
is
the
correctness
of
the
sum
is
always
doubted
here
are
facts
which
are
indubitable
and
unexplained
we
must
therefore
agree
neither
to
distrust
round
numbers
nor
to
place
particular
reliance
on
quite
irregular
figures
both
should
be
examined
it
may
be
that
the
judgment
of
the
correctness
of
an
inference
is
made
analogously
to
that
of
numbers
and
that
the
latter
exercise
an
influence
on
the
judgment
which
is
as
much
conceded
popularly
as
it
is
actually
combated
since
kant
it
has
been
quite
discovered
that
the
judgment
that
fools
are
in
the
majority
must
lead
through
many
more
such
truths
in
judging
and
it
is
indifferent
whether
the
judgment
dealt
with
is
that
of
the
law
court
or
of
a
voting
legislature
or
mere
judgments
as
such
schiel
says
has
been
frequently
asserted
that
a
judgment
is
more
probably
correct
according
to
the
number
of
judges
and
quite
apart
from
the
fact
that
the
judge
is
less
careful
makes
less
effort
and
feels
less
responsibility
when
he
has
associates
this
is
a
false
inference
from
an
enormous
average
of
cases
which
are
necessarily
remote
from
any
average
whatever
and
when
certain
prejudices
or
weaknesses
of
mind
are
added
the
mistake
multiplies
whoever
accurately
follows
if
he
can
avoid
getting
bored
the
voting
of
bodies
and
considers
by
themselves
individual
opinions
about
the
subject
they
having
remained
individual
against
large
majorities
and
hence
worthy
of
being
subjected
to
a
cold
and
unprejudiced
examination
will
learn
some
rare
facts
it
is
especially
interesting
to
study
the
judgment
of
the
full
bench
with
regard
to
a
case
which
has
been
falsely
judged
surprisingly
often
only
a
single
individual
voice
has
spoken
correctly
this
fact
is
a
warning
to
the
judge
in
such
cases
carefully
to
listen
to
the
individual
opinion
and
to
consider
that
it
is
very
likely
to
deserve
study
just
because
it
is
so
significantly
in
the
minority
the
same
thing
is
to
be
kept
in
mind
when
a
thing
is
asserted
by
a
large
number
of
witnesses
apart
from
the
fact
that
they
depend
upon
one
another
that
they
suggest
to
one
another
it
is
also
easily
possible
especially
if
any
source
of
error
is
present
that
the
latter
shall
have
influenced
all
the
witnesses
whether
a
judgment
has
been
made
by
a
single
judge
or
is
the
verdict
of
any
number
of
jurymen
is
quite
indifferent
since
the
correctness
of
a
judgment
does
not
lie
in
numbers
exner
says
degree
of
probability
of
a
correctness
depends
upon
the
richness
of
the
field
of
the
associations
brought
to
bear
in
establishing
it
the
value
of
knowledge
is
judicially
constituted
in
this
fact
for
it
is
in
essence
the
expansion
of
the
scope
of
association
and
the
value
is
proportional
to
the
richness
of
the
associations
between
the
present
fact
and
the
knowledge
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
of
the
doctrines
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
and
it
controverts
altogether
those
who
suppose
that
we
ought
to
be
satisfied
with
the
knowledge
of
some
dozens
of
statutes
a
few
commentaries
and
so
and
so
many
precedents
if
we
add
that
judgment
is
an
identification
and
that
in
every
judgment
we
assert
that
the
content
represented
is
identical
in
spite
of
two
different
associative
relationships
it
must
become
clear
what
dangers
we
undergo
if
the
associative
relationships
of
a
judge
are
too
poor
and
narrow
as
mittermaier
said
seventy
years
ago
are
enough
cases
in
which
the
weight
of
the
evidence
is
so
great
that
all
judges
are
convinced
of
the
truth
in
the
same
way
but
in
itself
what
determines
the
judgment
is
the
essential
character
of
him
who
makes
what
he
means
by
essential
character
has
already
been
indicated
we
have
yet
to
consider
the
question
of
the
value
of
inferences
made
by
a
witness
from
his
own
combinations
of
facts
or
his
descriptions
the
necessity
in
such
cases
of
redoubled
and
numerous
examinations
is
often
overlooked
suppose
for
example
that
the
witness
does
not
know
a
certain
important
date
but
by
combining
what
he
does
know
infers
it
to
have
been
the
second
of
june
on
which
day
the
event
under
discussion
took
place
he
makes
the
inference
because
at
the
time
he
had
a
call
from
a
who
was
in
the
habit
of
coming
on
wednesdays
but
there
could
be
no
wednesday
after
june
seventh
because
the
witness
had
gone
on
a
long
journey
on
that
day
and
it
could
not
have
been
may
because
this
day
preceded
a
holiday
and
the
shop
was
open
late
a
thing
not
done
on
the
day
a
called
nor
moreover
could
the
date
have
been
may
because
it
was
very
warm
on
the
day
in
question
and
the
temperature
began
to
rise
only
after
may
in
view
of
these
facts
the
event
under
discussion
must
have
occurred
upon
june
and
only
on
that
day
as
a
rule
such
combinations
are
very
influential
because
they
appear
cautious
wise
and
convincing
they
impose
upon
people
without
inclination
toward
such
processes
more
so
than
they
have
a
right
to
inasmuch
as
they
present
little
difficulty
to
anybody
who
is
accustomed
to
them
and
to
whom
they
occur
almost
spontaneously
as
usually
a
thing
that
makes
a
great
impression
upon
us
is
not
especially
examined
but
is
accepted
as
astounding
and
indubitable
so
here
but
how
very
necessary
it
is
carefully
to
examine
such
things
and
to
consider
whether
the
single
premises
are
sound
the
example
in
question
or
any
other
example
will
show
the
individual
dates
the
facts
and
assumptions
may
easily
be
mistaken
and
the
smallest
oversight
may
render
the
result
false
or
at
least
not
convincing
the
examination
of
manuscripts
is
still
more
difficult
what
is
written
has
a
certain
convincing
power
not
only
on
others
but
on
the
writer
and
much
as
we
may
be
willing
to
doubt
and
to
improve
what
has
been
written
immediately
or
at
most
a
short
time
ago
a
manuscript
of
some
age
has
always
a
kind
of
authority
and
we
give
it
correctness
cheaply
when
that
is
in
question
in
any
event
there
regularly
arises
in
such
a
case
the
problem
whether
the
written
description
is
quite
correct
and
as
regularly
the
answer
is
a
convinced
affirmative
it
is
impossible
to
give
any
general
rule
for
testing
such
affirmation
ordinarily
some
clearness
may
be
attained
by
paying
attention
to
the
purpose
of
the
manuscript
especially
in
order
to
ascertain
its
sources
and
the
personality
of
the
writer
there
is
much
in
the
external
form
of
the
manuscript
not
that
especial
care
and
order
in
the
notes
are
particularly
significant
i
once
published
the
accounts
of
an
old
peasant
who
could
neither
read
nor
write
and
his
accounts
with
a
neighbor
were
done
in
untrained
but
very
clear
fashion
and
were
accepted
as
indubitable
in
a
civil
case
the
purposiveness
order
and
continuity
of
a
manuscript
indicate
that
it
was
not
written
after
the
event
and
are
therefore
together
with
the
reason
for
having
written
it
and
obviously
with
the
personality
of
the
writer
determinative
of
its
value
section
j
mistaken
inferences
it
is
true
as
huxley
says
that
human
beings
would
have
made
fewer
mistakes
if
they
had
kept
in
mind
their
tendency
to
false
judgments
which
depend
upon
extraordinary
combinations
of
real
experiences
when
people
say
i
felt
i
heard
i
saw
this
or
that
in
cases
put
of
they
mean
only
that
they
have
been
aware
of
some
kind
of
sensation
the
nature
of
which
they
determine
in
a
judgment
most
erroneous
inferences
ensue
in
this
fashion
they
are
rarely
formal
and
rarely
arise
by
virtue
of
a
failure
to
use
logical
principles
their
ground
is
the
inner
paucity
of
a
premise
which
itself
is
erroneous
because
of
an
erroneous
perception
or
conception
as
mill
rightly
points
out
a
large
portion
of
mankind
make
mistakes
because
of
tacit
assumptions
that
the
order
of
nature
and
the
order
of
knowledge
are
identical
and
that
things
must
exist
as
they
are
thought
so
that
when
two
things
can
not
be
thought
together
they
are
supposed
not
to
exist
together
and
the
inconceivable
is
supposed
to
be
identical
with
the
but
what
they
do
not
succeed
in
conceiving
must
not
be
confused
with
the
absolutely
inconceivable
the
difficulty
or
impossibility
of
conceiving
may
be
subjective
and
conditional
and
may
prevent
us
from
understanding
the
relation
of
a
series
of
events
only
because
some
otherwise
proximate
condition
is
unknown
or
overlooked
very
often
in
criminal
cases
when
i
can
make
no
progress
in
some
otherwise
simple
matter
i
recall
the
well
known
story
of
an
old
peasant
woman
who
saw
the
tail
of
a
horse
through
an
open
stable
door
and
the
head
of
another
through
another
door
several
yards
away
and
because
the
colors
of
both
head
and
tail
were
similar
was
moved
to
cry
out
lord
what
a
long
horse
the
old
lady
started
with
the
presupposition
that
the
rump
and
the
head
of
the
two
horses
belonged
to
one
and
could
make
no
use
of
the
obvious
solution
of
the
problem
of
the
inconceivably
long
horse
by
breaking
it
in
two
such
mistakes
may
be
classified
under
five
heads
aprioristic
mistakes
natural
prejudices
mistakes
in
observation
mistakes
in
generalization
when
the
facts
are
right
and
the
inferences
wrong
mistakes
of
confusion
ambiguity
of
terms
or
mistakes
by
association
logical
fallacies
all
five
fallacies
play
important
r√¥les
in
the
work
we
have
very
frequently
to
fight
natural
prejudices
we
take
certain
classes
of
people
to
be
better
and
others
to
be
worse
than
the
average
and
without
clearly
expressing
it
we
expect
that
the
first
class
will
not
easily
do
evil
nor
the
other
good
we
have
prejudices
about
some
one
or
another
view
of
life
some
definition
of
justice
or
point
of
view
although
we
have
sufficient
opportunity
to
be
convinced
of
their
incorrectness
we
have
a
similar
prejudice
in
trusting
our
human
knowledge
judgment
of
impressions
facts
far
too
much
so
far
indeed
that
certain
relations
and
accidents
occurring
to
any
person
we
like
or
dislike
will
determine
his
advantage
or
disadvantage
at
our
hands
of
importance
under
this
heading
too
are
those
inferences
which
are
made
in
spite
of
the
knowledge
that
the
case
is
different
the
power
of
sense
is
more
vigorous
than
that
of
reflection
as
hartmann
expresses
it
prejudices
arising
from
sensation
are
not
conscious
judgments
of
the
understanding
but
instinctively
practical
postulates
and
are
therefore
very
difficult
to
destroy
or
even
set
aside
by
means
of
conscious
consideration
you
may
tell
yourself
a
thousand
times
that
the
moon
at
the
horizon
is
as
big
as
at
the
zenith
nevertheless
you
see
it
smaller
at
the
such
fixed
impressions
we
meet
in
every
criminal
trial
and
if
once
we
have
considered
how
the
criminal
had
committed
a
crime
we
no
longer
get
free
of
the
impression
even
when
we
have
discovered
quite
certainly
that
he
had
no
share
in
the
deed
the
second
type
of
fallacy
mistakes
in
observation
will
be
discussed
later
under
sense
perception
and
similar
matters
under
mistakes
of
generalization
the
most
important
processes
are
those
of
arrangement
where
the
environment
or
accompanying
circumstances
exercise
so
determinative
an
influence
that
the
inference
is
often
made
from
them
alone
and
without
examination
of
the
object
in
question
the
tanagra
in
the
house
of
an
i
take
to
be
genuine
without
further
examination
the
golden
watch
in
the
pocket
of
a
tramp
to
be
stolen
a
giant
meteor
the
skeleton
of
an
iguana
a
nerva
in
the
royal
museum
of
berlin
i
take
to
be
indubitably
original
and
indubitably
imitations
in
the
college
museum
of
a
small
town
the
same
is
true
of
events
i
hear
a
child
screeching
in
the
house
of
the
surly
wife
of
the
shoemaker
so
i
do
not
doubt
that
she
is
spanking
it
in
the
mountains
i
infer
from
certain
whistles
the
presence
of
chamois
and
a
single
long
drawn
tone
that
might
be
due
to
anything
i
declare
to
have
come
from
an
organ
if
a
church
is
near
by
all
such
processes
are
founded
upon
experience
synthesis
and
if
you
like
prejudices
they
will
often
lead
to
proper
conclusions
but
in
many
cases
they
will
have
the
opposite
effect
it
is
a
frequently
recurring
fact
that
in
such
cases
careful
examination
is
most
of
all
necessary
because
people
are
so
much
inclined
to
depend
upon
first
always
indubitably
true
the
understanding
has
generalized
simply
and
hastily
without
seeking
for
justification
the
only
way
of
avoiding
great
damage
is
to
extract
the
fact
in
itself
from
its
environment
and
accompanying
circumstance
and
to
study
it
without
them
the
environment
is
only
a
means
of
proof
but
no
proof
and
only
when
the
object
or
event
has
been
validated
in
itself
may
we
adduce
one
means
of
proof
after
another
and
modify
our
point
of
view
accordingly
not
to
do
so
means
always
to
land
upon
false
inferences
and
what
is
worse
to
find
it
impossible
upon
the
recognition
of
an
error
later
on
to
discover
at
what
point
it
has
occurred
by
that
time
it
has
been
buried
too
deep
in
the
heap
of
our
inferential
system
to
be
discoverable
the
error
of
confusion
mill
reduces
especially
to
the
unclear
representation
of
proof
is
to
the
ambiguity
of
words
we
rarely
meet
such
cases
but
when
we
do
they
occur
after
we
have
compounded
concepts
and
have
united
rather
carelessly
some
symbol
with
an
object
or
an
event
which
ought
not
to
have
been
united
simply
because
we
were
mistaken
about
its
importance
a
warning
example
may
be
found
in
the
inference
which
is
made
from
the
sentence
given
a
criminal
because
of
the
petitio
the
ignorantia
belong
to
this
class
the
purely
logical
mistakes
or
mistakes
of
syllogism
do
not
enter
into
these
considerations
section
k
statistics
of
the
moral
situation
upon
the
first
glance
it
might
be
asserted
that
statistics
and
psychology
have
nothing
to
do
with
each
other
if
however
it
is
observed
that
the
extraordinary
and
inexplicable
results
presented
by
statistics
of
morals
and
general
statistics
influence
our
thought
and
reflection
unconditionally
its
importance
for
criminal
psychology
can
not
be
denied
responsibility
abundance
of
criminals
their
distribution
according
to
time
place
personality
and
circumstances
the
regularity
of
their
appearance
all
these
have
so
profound
an
influence
upon
us
both
essentially
and
circumstantially
that
even
our
judgments
and
resolutions
no
less
than
the
conduct
and
thought
of
other
people
whom
we
judge
are
certainly
altered
by
them
moreover
probability
and
statistics
are
in
such
close
and
inseparable
connection
that
we
may
not
make
use
of
or
interpret
the
one
without
the
other
eminent
psychological
contributions
by
m√ºnsterberg
show
the
importance
the
statistical
problems
have
for
psychology
this
writer
warns
us
against
the
of
the
results
of
the
statistics
of
morality
and
believes
that
its
proper
tendencies
will
be
discovered
only
much
later
in
any
event
the
real
value
of
statistical
synthesis
and
deduction
can
be
discovered
only
when
it
is
closely
studied
this
is
particularly
true
with
regard
to
criminal
conditions
the
works
of
many
authors
teach
us
things
that
would
not
otherwise
be
learned
and
they
would
not
be
dealt
with
here
if
only
a
systematic
study
of
the
works
themselves
could
be
of
use
we
speak
here
only
of
their
importance
for
our
own
discipline
nobody
doubts
that
there
are
mysteries
in
the
figures
and
figuring
of
statistics
we
admit
honestly
that
we
know
no
more
than
when
paul
de
decker
discussed
labors
in
statistics
of
morality
in
the
brussels
academy
of
science
and
confessed
what
a
puzzle
it
was
that
human
conduct
even
in
its
smallest
manifestations
obeyed
in
their
totality
constant
and
immutable
laws
concerning
this
curious
fact
adolf
wagner
says
a
traveler
had
told
us
something
about
some
people
where
a
statute
determines
exactly
how
many
persons
per
year
shall
marry
die
commit
suicide
and
crimes
within
certain
classes
and
if
he
had
announced
furthermore
that
these
laws
were
altogether
obeyed
what
should
we
have
said
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
laws
are
obeyed
all
the
world
of
course
the
statistics
of
morality
deal
with
quantities
not
qualities
but
in
the
course
of
statistical
examination
the
latter
are
met
with
so
examinations
into
the
relation
of
crime
to
and
education
into
the
classes
that
show
most
suicides
connect
human
qualities
with
statistical
data
the
time
is
certainly
not
far
off
when
we
shall
seek
for
the
proper
view
of
the
probability
of
a
certain
assumption
with
regard
to
some
rare
crime
doubtful
suicide
extraordinary
psychic
phenomena
with
the
help
of
a
statistical
table
this
possibility
is
made
clearer
when
the
inconceivable
constancy
of
some
figures
is
considered
suppose
we
study
the
number
of
suicides
since
in
austria
in
periods
of
eight
years
we
find
the
following
figures
a
regular
increase
which
is
comparable
to
law
or
suppose
we
consider
the
number
of
women
who
in
the
course
of
ten
continuous
years
in
france
shot
themselves
we
find
there
is
merely
an
alternation
between
and
should
not
we
look
up
if
in
some
one
year
eight
or
nine
appeared
should
not
we
give
some
consideration
to
the
possibility
that
the
suicide
is
only
a
pretended
one
or
suppose
we
consider
the
number
of
men
who
have
drowned
themselves
within
the
same
time
wagner
says
rightly
of
such
figures
they
contain
the
arithmetical
relation
of
the
mechanism
belonging
to
a
moral
order
which
ought
to
call
out
even
greater
astonishment
than
the
mechanism
of
stellar
still
more
remarkable
are
the
figures
when
they
are
so
brought
together
that
they
may
be
seen
as
a
curve
it
is
in
this
way
that
drobisch
brings
together
a
table
which
distributes
crime
according
to
age
out
of
a
thousand
crimes
committed
by
persons
between
the
ages
of
against
against
property
persons
than
years
than
through
both
columns
a
definite
curve
may
be
drawn
which
grows
steadily
and
drops
steadily
greater
mathematical
certainty
is
almost
unthinkable
of
similar
great
importance
is
the
parallelization
of
the
most
important
conditions
when
suicides
in
france
from
to
are
taken
in
series
of
five
years
we
find
the
figures
if
now
during
that
period
the
population
has
increased
from
to
only
millions
other
determining
factors
have
to
be
sought
again
most
authorities
as
quoted
by
gutberlet
indicate
that
most
suicides
are
committed
in
june
fewest
in
december
most
at
night
especially
at
dawn
fewest
at
noon
especially
between
twelve
and
two
the
greatest
frequency
is
among
the
the
age
between
sixty
and
seventy
and
the
nationality
saxon
oettingen
the
combination
of
such
observations
leads
to
the
indubitable
conclusion
that
the
results
are
sufficiently
constant
to
permit
making
at
least
an
assumption
with
regard
to
the
cases
in
hand
at
present
statistics
say
little
of
benefit
with
regard
to
the
individual
mill
is
right
in
holding
that
the
will
help
insurance
companies
but
will
tell
any
individual
little
concerning
the
duration
of
his
life
according
to
adolf
wagner
the
principal
statistical
rule
is
the
law
has
validity
when
dealing
with
great
numbers
the
constant
regularity
is
perceivable
only
when
cases
are
very
numerous
single
cases
show
many
a
variation
and
exception
quetelet
has
shown
the
truth
of
this
in
his
example
of
the
circle
you
draw
a
circle
on
the
blackboard
with
thick
chalk
and
study
its
outline
closely
in
small
sections
you
will
find
the
coarsest
irregularities
but
if
you
step
far
back
and
study
the
circle
as
a
whole
its
regular
perfect
form
becomes
quite
but
the
circle
must
be
drawn
carefully
and
correctly
and
one
must
not
give
way
to
sentimentality
and
tears
when
running
over
a
legs
in
drawing
emil
du
says
against
this
the
postmaster
announces
that
out
of
letters
a
year
exactly
so
and
so
many
come
unaddressed
we
think
nothing
of
the
matter
but
when
quetelet
counts
so
and
so
many
criminals
to
every
people
our
moral
sense
is
aroused
since
it
is
painful
to
think
that
we
are
not
criminals
simply
because
somebody
else
has
drawn
the
black
but
really
there
is
as
little
regrettable
in
this
fact
as
in
the
observation
that
every
year
so
and
so
many
men
break
their
legs
and
so
and
so
many
die
in
those
cases
also
a
large
number
of
people
have
the
good
fortune
not
to
have
broken
their
legs
nor
to
have
died
we
have
here
the
irrefutable
logic
of
facts
which
reveals
nothing
vexatious
on
the
other
hand
there
is
no
doubt
that
our
criminal
statistics
to
be
useful
must
be
handled
in
a
rather
different
fashion
we
saw
in
studying
the
statistics
of
suicide
that
inferences
with
regard
to
individual
cases
could
be
drawn
only
when
the
material
had
been
studied
carefully
and
examined
on
all
sides
but
our
criminological
statistic
is
rarely
examined
with
such
thoroughness
the
tenor
of
such
examination
is
far
too
bureaucratic
and
determined
by
the
statutes
and
the
process
of
law
the
criminalist
gives
the
statistician
the
figures
but
the
latter
can
derive
no
significant
principles
from
them
consider
for
once
any
official
report
on
the
annual
results
in
the
criminal
courts
in
any
country
under
and
over
the
thousands
and
thousands
of
figures
and
rows
of
figures
there
is
a
great
mass
of
very
difficult
work
which
has
been
profitable
only
in
a
very
small
degree
i
have
before
me
the
four
reports
of
a
single
year
which
deal
with
the
activities
of
the
austrian
courts
and
criminal
institutions
and
which
are
excellent
in
their
completeness
correctness
and
thorough
revision
open
the
most
important
the
results
of
the
administration
of
criminal
law
in
the
various
departments
of
the
country
and
you
find
everything
recorded
how
many
were
punished
here
and
how
many
there
what
their
crimes
were
the
percentage
of
condemned
according
to
age
social
standing
religion
occupation
wealth
etc
then
again
you
see
endless
tables
of
arrests
sentences
etc
now
the
value
of
all
this
is
to
indicate
merely
whether
a
certain
regularity
is
discoverable
in
the
procedure
of
the
officials
material
psychologically
valuable
is
rare
there
is
some
energetic
approximation
to
it
in
the
consideration
of
culture
wealth
and
previous
sentences
but
even
these
are
dealt
with
most
generally
while
the
basis
and
motive
of
the
is
barely
indicated
we
can
perceive
little
consideration
of
motives
with
regard
to
education
earlier
life
in
their
relation
to
sentencing
only
when
statistics
will
be
made
to
deal
actually
and
in
every
direction
with
qualities
and
not
merely
with
quantities
will
they
begin
to
have
a
really
scientific
value
topic
ii
knowledge
section
criminal
law
like
all
other
disciplines
must
ask
under
what
conditions
and
when
we
are
entitled
to
say
the
answer
is
far
from
being
perennially
identical
though
it
might
have
been
expected
that
the
conviction
of
knowledge
would
be
ever
united
with
identical
conditions
the
strange
and
significant
difference
is
determined
by
the
question
whether
the
verdict
know
will
or
will
not
have
practical
consequences
when
we
discuss
some
question
like
the
place
of
a
certain
battle
the
temperature
of
the
moon
or
the
appearance
of
a
certain
animal
in
the
pliocene
we
first
assume
that
there
is
a
true
answer
reasons
for
and
against
will
appear
the
former
increase
in
number
and
suddenly
we
discover
in
some
book
the
assurance
that
know
the
that
assurance
passes
into
so
and
so
many
other
books
and
if
it
is
untrue
no
essential
harm
can
be
done
but
when
science
is
trying
to
determine
the
quality
of
some
substance
the
therapeutic
efficiency
of
some
poison
the
possibilities
of
some
medium
of
communication
the
applicability
of
some
great
national
economic
principle
like
free
trade
then
it
takes
much
more
time
to
announce
know
that
this
is
so
and
not
in
this
case
one
sees
clearly
that
tremendous
consequences
follow
on
the
practical
interpretation
of
know
and
therefore
there
is
in
these
cases
quite
a
different
taxation
of
knowledge
from
that
in
cases
where
the
practical
consequences
are
comparatively
negligible
our
work
is
obviously
one
of
concrete
practical
consequences
it
contains
moreover
conditions
that
make
imperfect
knowledge
equivalent
to
complete
ignorance
for
in
delivering
sentence
every
may
each
time
mean
know
that
he
has
not
done
or
again
know
that
it
is
not
altogether
certain
that
he
has
done
our
knowledge
in
such
cases
is
limited
to
the
recognition
of
the
confusion
of
the
subject
and
knowledge
in
its
widest
sense
is
the
consciousness
of
some
definite
content
in
this
case
confusion
here
as
everywhere
knowledge
is
not
identical
with
truth
knowledge
is
only
subjective
truth
whoever
knows
has
reasons
for
considering
things
true
and
none
against
so
considering
them
here
he
is
entitled
to
assume
that
all
who
recognize
his
knowledge
will
justify
it
but
when
even
everybody
justifies
his
knowledge
it
can
be
justified
only
in
its
immediacy
the
whole
affair
may
look
different
for
this
reason
we
criminalists
assert
much
less
than
other
investigators
that
we
seek
the
truth
if
we
presume
to
such
an
assertion
we
should
not
have
the
institutions
of
equity
revision
and
in
criminal
procedure
retrial
our
knowledge
when
named
modestly
is
only
the
innermost
conviction
that
some
matter
is
so
and
so
according
to
human
capacity
and
and
such
a
condition
of
parenthetically
we
agree
that
and
such
a
condition
of
may
alter
with
every
instant
and
we
declare
ourselves
ready
to
study
the
matter
anew
if
the
conditions
change
we
demand
material
but
relative
truth
one
of
the
acutest
thinkers
von
mayer
the
discoverer
of
the
working
principle
of
of
energy
says
most
important
if
not
the
only
rule
for
real
natural
science
is
this
always
to
believe
that
it
is
our
task
to
know
the
phenomena
before
we
seek
explanation
of
higher
causes
if
a
fact
is
once
known
in
all
its
aspects
it
is
thereby
explained
and
the
duty
of
science
the
author
did
not
have
us
lawyers
in
mind
when
he
made
this
assertion
but
we
who
modestly
seek
to
subordinate
our
discipline
to
that
of
the
correct
one
of
natural
science
must
take
this
doctrine
absolutely
to
heart
every
crime
we
study
is
a
fact
and
once
we
know
it
in
all
its
aspects
and
have
accounted
for
every
little
detail
we
have
explained
it
and
have
done
our
duty
but
the
word
explain
does
not
lead
us
very
far
it
is
mainly
a
matter
of
reducing
the
mass
of
the
inexplicable
to
a
minimum
and
the
whole
to
its
simplest
terms
if
only
we
succeed
in
this
reduction
in
most
cases
we
substitute
for
one
term
not
another
still
better
one
but
a
strange
one
which
may
mean
different
things
to
different
people
so
again
we
explain
one
event
by
means
of
another
more
difficult
one
it
is
unfortunate
that
we
lawyers
are
more
than
all
others
inclined
to
make
unnecessary
explanations
because
our
criminal
law
has
accustomed
us
to
silly
definitions
which
rarely
bring
us
closer
to
the
issue
and
which
supply
us
only
with
a
lot
of
words
difficult
to
understand
instead
of
easily
comprehensible
ones
hence
we
reach
explanations
both
impossible
and
hard
to
make
explanations
which
we
ourselves
are
often
unwilling
to
believe
and
again
we
try
to
explain
and
to
define
events
which
otherwise
would
have
been
understood
by
everybody
and
which
become
doubtful
and
uncertain
because
of
the
attempt
the
matter
becomes
especially
difficult
when
we
feel
ourselves
unsure
or
when
we
have
discovered
or
expect
contradiction
then
we
try
to
convince
ourselves
that
we
know
something
although
at
the
beginning
we
were
clearly
enough
aware
that
we
knew
nothing
we
must
not
forget
that
our
knowledge
can
attain
only
to
ideas
of
things
it
consists
alone
in
the
perception
of
the
relation
and
agreement
or
in
the
incompatibility
and
contradiction
of
some
of
our
ideas
our
task
lies
exactly
in
the
explication
of
these
impressions
and
the
more
thoroughly
that
is
done
the
greater
and
more
certain
is
the
result
but
we
must
never
trust
our
own
impressions
merely
the
theologian
who
deals
with
the
supersensible
has
said
all
that
from
his
point
of
view
he
can
say
when
the
jurist
who
represents
those
fundamental
laws
which
are
the
result
of
social
experience
has
considered
all
reasons
from
his
own
point
of
view
the
final
authority
in
certain
cases
must
be
the
physician
who
is
engaged
in
studying
the
life
of
the
i
get
this
from
maudsley
and
it
leads
us
to
keep
in
mind
that
knowledge
is
very
and
limited
and
that
an
event
is
known
only
when
all
have
spoken
who
possess
especial
knowledge
of
its
type
hence
every
criminalist
is
required
to
found
his
knowledge
upon
that
of
the
largest
possible
number
of
experts
and
not
to
judge
or
discuss
any
matter
which
requires
especial
information
without
having
first
consulted
an
expert
with
regard
to
it
only
the
sham
knows
everything
the
trained
man
understands

little
the
mind
of
any
individual
may
grasp
and
how
many
must
co√∂perate
in
order
to
explain
the
very
simplest
things
the
complexity
of
the
matter
lies
in
the

use

recent
science
has
made

progress
in
this

of

to
confine

merely
to

superficial
and

hence
to
the
inconceivable

incomprehensible

easy
the

not

we
ask
says
mittermaier
the
reason
of
our
conviction
of
the
truth
of
facts
even
in
very
important
matters
and
the
basis
of
every
judgment
concerning
existence
of
facts
we
find
that
the
evidence
of
the
senses
is
final
and
seems
therefore
the
only
true
source
of
there
has
always
of
course
been
a
quarrel
as
to
the
objectivity
and
reliability
of
that
the
senses
do
not
lie
because
they
are
always
correct
but
because
they
do
not
judge
is
a
frequently
quoted
sentence
of
the
cyrenaics
have
already
suggested
this
in
asserting
that
pleasure
and
pain
alone
are
indubitable
aristotle
narrows
the
veracity
of
sensation
to
its
essential
content
as
does
epicurus
descartes
locke
and
leibnitz
have
suggested
that
no
image
may
be
called
as
mere
change
of
feeling
true
or
false
sensationalism
in
the
work
of
gassendi
condillac
and
helvetius
undertook
for
this
reason
the
defense
of
the
senses
against
the
reproach
of
deceit
and
as
a
rule
did
it
by
invoking
the
infallibility
of
the
sense
of
touch
against
the
reproach
of
the
contradictions
in
the
other
senses
reid
went
back
to
aristotle
in
distinguishing
specific
objects
for
each
sense
and
in
assuming
the
truth
of
each
sense
within
its
own
field
that
these
various
theories
can
be
adjusted
is
doubtful
even
if
from
a
more
conservative
point
of
view
the
subject
may
be
treated
quantitatively
the
modern
quantification
of
psychology
was
begun
by
herbart
who
developed
a
mathematical
system
of
psychology
by
introducing
certain
completely
unempirical
postulates
concerning
the
nature
of
representation
and
by
applying
certain
simple
premises
in
all
deductions
concerning
numerical
extent
then
came
fechner
who
assumed
the
summation
of
stimuli
and
finally
these
views
were
determined
and
fixed
by
the
law
according
to
which
the
intensity
of
the
stimulus
must
increase
in
the
proportion
that
the
intensity
of
the
sensation
is
to
increase
if
a
stimulus
of
units
requires
the
addition
of
before
it
can
be
perceived
a
stimulus
of
units
would
require
the
addition
of
this
law
which
is
of
immense
importance
to
criminalists
who
are
discussing
the
of
witnesses
has
been
thoroughly
and
conclusively
dealt
with
by
a
meinong
psychology
takes
qualities
perceived
externally
to
be
in
themselves
subjective
but
capable
of
receiving
objectivity
through
our
relation
to
the
outer
world
the
qualitative
character
of
our
sensory
content
produced
by
external
stimuli
depends
primarily
on
the
organization
of
our
senses
this
is
the
fundamental
law
of
perception
of
modern
psychology
variously
expressed
but
axiomatic
in
all
physiological
in
this
direction
helmholtz
has
done
pioneer
work
he
treats
particularly
the
problem
of
optics
and
physiological
optics
is
the
study
of
perception
by
means
of
the
sense
of
sight
we
see
things
in
the
external
world
through
the
medium
of
light
which
they
direct
upon
our
eyes
the
light
strikes
the
retina
and
causes
a
sensation
the
sensation
brought
to
the
brain
by
means
of
the
optic
nerve
becomes
the
condition
of
the
representation
in
consciousness
of
certain
objects
distributed
in
space
we
make
use
of
the
sensation
which
the
light
stimulates
in
the
mechanism
of
the
optic
nerve
to
construct
representations
concerning
the
existence
form
and
condition
of
external
objects
hence
we
call
images
perceptions
of
sight
our
according
to
this
theory
consists
therefore
entirely
of
sensations
the
latter
constitute
the
stuff
or
the
content
from
which
the
other
is
constructed
our
sensations
are
effects
caused
in
our
organs
externally
and
the
manifestation
of
such
an
effect
depends
essentially
upon
the
nature
of
the
apparatus
which
has
been
stimulated
there
are
certain
really
known
inferences
those
made
by
the
astronomer
from
the
perspective
pictures
of
the
stars
to
their
positions
in
space
these
inferences
are
founded
upon
knowledge
of
the
principles
of
optics
such
knowledge
of
optics
is
lacking
in
the
ordinary
function
of
seeing
nevertheless
it
is
permissible
to
conceive
the
psychical
function
of
ordinary
perception
as
unconscious
inferences
inasmuch
as
this
name
will
completely
distinguish
them
from
the
commonly
conscious
inferences
the
condition
is
of
especial
importance
to
us
we
need
investigation
to
determine
the
laws
of
the
influence
of
optical
and
acoustical
knowledge
upon
perception
that
these
laws
are
influential
may
be
verified
easily
whoever
is
ignorant
that
a
noise
is
reflected
back
considerably
will
say
that
a
wagon
is
turning
from
the
side
from
which
the
noise
comes
though
if
he
knows
the
law
if
he
knows
that
fact
his
answer
would
be
reversed
so
as
every
child
knows
that
the
reflection
of
sound
is
frequently
deceptive
everybody
who
is
asked
in
court
will
say
that
he
believes
the
wagon
to
be
on
the
right
side
though
it
might
as
well
have
been
on
the
left
again
if
we
were
unaware
that
light
is
otherwise
refracted
in
water
than
in
air
we
could
say
that
a
stick
in
the
water
has
been
bent
obtusely
but
inasmuch
as
everybody
knows
this
fact
of
the
relation
of
light
to
water
he
will
declare
that
the
stick
appears
bent
but
really
is
straight
from
these
simplest
of
to
the
most
complicated
known
only
to
half
a
dozen
foremost
physicists
there
is
an
infinite
series
of
laws
controlling
each
stage
of
perception
and
for
each
stage
there
is
a
group
of
men
who
know
just
so
much
and
no
more
we
have
therefore
to
assume
that
their
perceptions
will
vary
with
the
number
and
manner
of
their
accomplishments
and
we
may
almost
convince
ourselves
that
each
examinee
who
has
to
give
evidence
concerning
his
should
literally
undergo
examination
to
make
clear
his
scholarly
status
and
thereby
the
value
of
his
testimony
of
course
in
practice
this
is
not
required
first
of
all
we
judge
approximately
a
nature
and
nurture
and
according
to
the
impression
he
makes
upon
us
thence
his
intellectual
status
this
causes
great
mistakes
but
on
the
other
hand
the
testimony
is
concerned
almost
always
with
one
or
several
physical
events
so
that
a
simple
relational
interrogation
will
establish
certainly
whether
the
witness
knows
and
attends
to
the
physical
law
in
question
or
not
but
anyway
too
little
is
done
to
determine
the
means
a
man
uses
to
reach
a
certain
perception
if
instantaneous
contradictions
appear
there
is
little
damage
for
in
the
absence
of
anything
certain
further
inferences
are
fortunately
made
in
rare
cases
only
but
when
the
observation
is
that
of
one
person
alone
or
even
when
more
testify
but
have
accidentally
the
same
amount
of
knowledge
and
hence
have
made
the
same
mistake
and
no
contradiction
appears
we
suppose
ourselves
to
possess
the
precise
truth
confirmed
by
several
witnesses
and
we
argue
merrily
on
the
basis
of
it
in
the
meantime
we
quite
forget
that
contradictions
are
our
salvation
from
the
trusting
acceptance
of
untruth
and
that
the
absence
of
contradiction
means
as
a
rule
the
absence
of
a
starting
point
for
further
examination
for
this
reason
and
others
modern
psychology
requires
us
to
be
cautious
among
the
others
is
the
circumstance
that
perceptions
are
rarely
pure
their
purity
consists
in
containing
nothing
else
than
perception
they
are
mixed
when
they
are
connected
with
imaginations
judgments
efforts
and
volitions
how
rarely
a
perception
is
pure
i
have
already
tried
to
show
judgments
almost
always
accompany
it
i
repeat
too
that
owing
to
this
circumstance
and
our
ignorance
of
it
countless
testimonies
are
interpreted
altogether
falsely
this
is
true
in
many
other
fields
when
for
example
fick
says
condition
we
call
sensation
occurs
in
the
consciousness
of
the
subject
when
his
sensory
nerves
are
stimulated
he
does
not
mean
that
the
nervous
stimulus
in
itself
is
capable
of
causing
the
condition
in
question
this
one
stimulus
is
only
a
single
tone
in
the
murmur
of
countless
stimuli
which
earlier
and
at
the
same
time
have
influenced
us
and
are
different
in
their
effect
on
each
man
therefore
that
single
additional
tone
will
also
be
different
in
each
man
or
when
bernstein
says
that
the
stimulation
of
the
sensorium
and
the
passage
of
this
stimulation
to
the
brain
does
not
in
itself
imply
the
perception
of
an
object
or
an
event
in
the
external
world
we
gather
that
the
objectivity
of
the
perception
works
correctively
not
more
than
one
time
out
of
many
so
here
again
everything
depends
upon
the
nature
and
nurture
of
the
subject
sensations
are
according
to
aubert
still
more
subjective
are
the
specific
activity
of
the
sense
organs
not
therefore
passive
as
according
to
helmholtz
but
active
functions
of
the
sense
organs
perception
arises
when
we
combine
our
particular
sensations
with
the
pure
images
of
the
spirit
or
the
schemata
of
the
understanding
especially
with
the
pure
image
of
space
the
ejection
or
externalization
of
sensations
occurs
only
as
their
scheme
and
relation
to
the
unity
of
their
so
long
as
anything
is
conceived
as
passive
it
may
always
recur
more
identically
than
when
it
is
conceived
as
active
in
the
latter
case
the
individuality
of
the
particular
person
makes
the
perception
in
a
still
greater
degree
individual
and
makes
it
almost
the
creature
of
him
who
perceives
whether
aubert
is
right
or
not
is
not
our
task
to
discover
but
if
he
is
right
then
is
as
various
as
is
humanity
the
variety
is
still
further
increased
by
means
of
the
comprehensive
activity
which
fischer
presupposes
perception
has
a
comprehensive
or
compounding
activity
we
never
see
any
absolute
simple
and
hence
do
not
perceive
the
elements
of
things
we
see
merely
a
spatial
continuum
and
that
is
possible
only
through
comprehensive
activity
especially
in
the
case
of
movement
in
which
the
object
of
movement
and
the
environment
must
both
be
but
each
individual
method
of
is
different
and
it
is
uncertain
whether
this
is
purely
physical
whether
only
the
memory
assists
so
that
the
attention
is
biased
by
what
has
been
last
perceived
whether
imagination
is
at
work
or
an
especial
psychical
activity
must
be
presupposed
in
compounding
the
larger
elements
the
fact
is
that
men
may
perceive
an
enormous
variety
of
things
with
a
single
glance
and
generally
the
perceptive
power
will
vary
with
the
skill
of
the
individual
the
narrowest
smallest
most
particularizing
glance
is
that
of
the
most
foolish
and
the
broadest
most
comprehensive
and
comparing
glance
that
of
the
most
wise
this
is
particularly
noticeable
when
the
time
of
observation
is
short
the
one
has
perceived
little
and
generally
the
least
important
the
other
has
in
the
same
time
seen
everything
from
top
to
bottom
and
has
distinguished
between
the
important
and
the
unimportant
has
observed
the
former
rather
longer
than
the
latter
and
is
able
to
give
a
better
description
of
what
he
has
seen
and
then
when
two
so
different
descriptions
come
before
us
we
wonder
at
them
and
say
that
one
of
them
is
untrue
the
speed
of
apperception
has
been
subjected
to
measurement
by
auerbach
kries
baxt
von
tigerstedt
and
bergqvist
stern
vaschide
vurpass
etc
the
results
show
to
seconds
for
compounded
images
unfortunately
most
of
these
experiments
have
brought
little
unanimity
in
the
results
and
have
not
compared
the
of
very
clever
people
with
those
of
very
slow
and
stupid
ones
in
the
variety
of
perception
lies
the
power
of
presentation
in
our
sense
of
the
term
in
the
main
other
forces
assist
in
this
but
when
we
consider
how
the
senses
work
in
combination
we
must
conclude
that
they
determine
their
own
forms
we
are
to
say
that
sense
experience
instructs
us
concerning
the
manifoldness
of
objects
we
may
do
so
correctly
if
we
add
the
scholium
that
many
things
could
not
be
mentioned
without
so
d√∂rner
writes
but
if
we
approach
the
matter
from
another
side
we
see
how
remarkable
it
is
that
human
perceptions
can
be
compared
at
all
hermann
schwarz
says
to
the
opinion
of
the
physicists
we
know
external
events
directly
by
means
of
the
organs
the
nerves
of
which
serve
passively
to
support
consciousness
in
the
perception
of
such
events
on
the
contrary
according
to
the
opinion
of
most
physiologists
the
nerve
fibers
are
active
in
the
apprehension
of
external
events
they
modify
it
alter
it
until
it
is
well
nigh
unrecognizable
and
turn
it
over
to
consciousness
only
after
the
original
process
has
undergone
still
another
transformation
into
new
forms
of
mechanical
energy
in
the
ganglion
cells
of
the
outer
brain
this
is
the
difference
between
the
physical
theory
of
perception
and
the
in
this
connection
there
are
several
more
conditions
pertaining
to
general
first
of
all
there
is
that
vicariousness
of
the
senses
which
substitutes
one
sense
for
another
in
representation
the
substitution
of
one
sense
by
another
as
that
of
touch
and
sight
does
not
belong
to
the
present
discussion
the
substitution
of
sound
and
sight
is
only
apparent
when
i
have
several
times
heard
the
voice
of
some
person
without
seeing
him
i
will
imagine
a
definite
face
and
appearance
which
pure
imagination
so
again
if
i
hear
cries
for
help
near
some
stream
i
see
more
or
less
clearly
the
form
of
a
drowning
person
etc
it
is
quite
different
in
touching
and
seeing
if
i
touch
a
ball
a
die
a
cat
a
cloth
with
my
eyes
closed
then
i
may
so
clearly
see
the
color
of
the
object
before
me
that
i
might
be
really
seeing
it
but
in
this
case
there
is
a
real
substitution
of
greater
or
lesser
degree
the
same
vicariousness
occurs
when
perception
is
attributed
to
one
sense
while
it
properly
belongs
to
another
this
happens
particularly
at
such
times
when
one
has
not
been
present
during
the
event
or
when
the
perception
was
made
while
only
half
awake
or
a
long
time
ago
and
finally
when
a
group
of
other
impressions
have
accompanied
the
event
so
that
there
was
not
time
enough
if
i
may
say
so
properly
to
register
the
sense
impression
so
some
person
especially
a
close
friend
may
have
been
merely
heard
and
later
quite
convincingly
supposed
to
have
been
seen
sensitive
people
who
generally
have
an
acuter
olfactory
sense
than
others
attach
to
any
perceived
odor
all
the
other
appropriate
phenomena
the
vicariousnesses
of
visual
sensations
are
the
most
numerous
and
the
most
important
anybody
who
has
been
pushed
or
beaten
and
has
felt
the
blows
will
if
other
circumstances
permit
and
the
impulse
is
strong
enough
be
convinced
that
he
has
seen
his
assaulter
and
the
manner
of
the
assault
sometimes
people
who
are
shot
at
will
claim
to
have
seen
the
flight
of
the
ball
and
so
again
they
will
have
seen
in
a
dark
night
a
comparatively
distant
wagon
although
they
have
only
heard
the
noise
it
made
and
felt
the
vibration
it
is
fortunate
that
as
a
rule
such
people
try
to
be
just
in
answering
to
questions
which
concern
this
substitution
of
one
for
another
and
such
questions
ought
to
be
urgently
put
that
a
false
testimony
can
cause
significant
errors
is
as
obvious
as
the
fact
that
such
substitutions
are
most
frequent
with
nervous
and
imaginative
persons
still
more
significant
is
that
characteristic
phenomenon
to
us
of
considerable
importance
which
might
be
called
retrospective
illumination
of
perception
it
consists
in
the
appearance
of
a
under
conditions
of
some
noticeable
interruption
when
the
stimulus
does
not
as
a
rule
give
rise
to
that
perception
i
cite
a
simple
example
in
which
i
first
observed
this
fact
since
i
was
a
child
there
had
been
in
my
a
clock
the
loud
ticking
of
which
habit
of
many
years
prevented
my
hearing
once
as
i
lay
awake
in
bed
i
heard
it
tick
suddenly
three
times
then
fall
silent
and
stop
the
occurrence
interested
me
i
quickly
got
a
light
and
examined
the
clock
closely
the
pendulum
still
swung
but
without
a
sound
the
time
was
right
i
inferred
that
the
clock
must
have
stopped
going
just
a
few
minutes
before
and
i
soon
found
out
why
the
clock
is
not
encased
and
the
weight
of
the
pendulum
hangs
free
now
under
the
clock
there
always
stood
a
chair
which
this
time
had
been
so
placed
as
to
be
inclined
further
backward
the
weight
followed
that
inclination
and
so
the
silence
came
about
i
immediately
made
an
experiment
i
set
the
clock
going
again
and
again
held
the
weight
back
the
last
beats
of
the
pendulum
were
neither
quicker
nor
slower
nor
louder
or
softer
than
any
others
before
the
sudden
stoppage
of
the
clock
i
believe
the
explanation
to
be
as
follows
as
customary
noises
especially
are
unheard
i
did
not
hear
the
pendulum
of
the
clock
but
its
sudden
stopping
disturbed
the
balance
of
sound
which
had
been
dominating
the
room
this
called
attention
to
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
the
ticking
which
had
ceased
and
hence
perception
was
intensified
and
i
heard
the
last
ticks
which
i
had
not
perceived
before
one
after
another
the
latent
stimulus
caused
by
the
ticking
worked
backward
my
attention
was
naturally
awakened
only
the
last
tick
but
my
perception
was
consecutive
i
soon
heard
of
another
case
this
time
in
court
there
was
a
shooting
in
some
house
and
an
old
peasant
woman
who
was
busy
sewing
in
the
room
asserted
that
she
had
just
before
the
shooting
heard
a
steps
in
the
direction
from
which
the
shot
must
have
come
nobody
would
agree
that
there
was
any
reason
for
supposing
that
the
person
in
question
should
have
made
his
final
steps
more
noisily
than
his
preceding
ones
but
i
am
convinced
that
the
witness
told
the
truth
the
steps
of
the
new
arrival
were
perceived
subconsciously
the
further
disturbance
of
the
perception
hindered
her
occupation
and
finally
when
she
was
frightened
by
the
shot
the
upper
levels
of
consciousness
were
illuminated
and
the
noises
which
had
already
reached
the
subconsciousness
passed
over
the
threshold
and
were
consciously
perceived
i
learned
from
an
especially
significant
case
how
the
same
thing
could
happen
with
regard
to
vision
a
child
was
run
over
and
killed
by
a
careless
coachman
a
pensioned
officer
saw
this
through
the
window
his
description
was
quite
characteristic
it
was
the
anniversary
of
a
certain
battle
the
old
gentleman
who
stood
by
the
window
thinking
about
it
and
about
his
long
dead
comrades
was
looking
blankly
out
into
the
street
the
horrible
cry
of
the
unhappy
child
woke
him
up
and
he
really
began
to
see
then
he
observed
that
he
had
in
truth
seen
everything
that
had
happened
the
child
was
knocked
over
for
some
reason
the
coachman
had
turned
around
turning
the
horses
in
such
a
way
at
the
same
time
that
the
latter
jumped
sidewise
upon
the
frightened
child
and
hence
the
accident
the
general
expressed
himself
correctly
in
this
fashion
saw
it
all
but
i
did
not
perceive
and
know
that
i
saw
it
until
the
scream
of
the
he
offered
also
in
proof
of
the
correctness
of
his
testimony
that
he
an
old
cavalry
officer
would
have
had
to
see
the
approaching
misfortune
if
he
had
consciously
seen
the
moving
of
the
coachman
and
then
he
would
have
had
to
be
frightened
but
he
knew
definitely
that
he
was
frightened
only
when
the
child
cried
out
he
could
not
therefore
have
consciously
perceived
the
preceding
event
his
story
was
confirmed
by
other
witnesses
this
psychological
process
is
of
significance
in
criminal
trials
inasmuch
as
many
actionable
cases
depend
upon
sudden
and
unexpected
events
where
retrospective
illumination
may
frequently
come
in
in
such
cases
it
is
most
important
to
determine
what
actually
has
been
perceived
and
it
is
never
indifferent
whether
we
take
the
testimony
in
question
as
true
or
not
with
regard
to
the
senses
of
criminals
lombroso
and
ottolenghi
have
asserted
that
they
are
duller
than
those
of
ordinary
people
the
assertion
is
based
on
a
collection
made
by
lombroso
of
instances
of
the
great
indifference
of
criminals
to
pain
but
he
has
overlooked
the
fact
that
the
reason
is
quite
another
thing
barbarous
living
and
barbarous
morals
are
especially
dulling
so
that
indifference
to
pain
is
a
characteristic
of
all
barbarous
nations
and
characters
inasmuch
as
there
are
many
criminals
among
barbarous
people
barbarity
criminality
and
indifference
to
pain
come
together
in
a
large
number
of
cases
but
there
is
nothing
remarkable
in
this
and
a
direct
relation
between
crime
and
dullness
of
the
senses
can
not
be
demonstrated
b
the
sense
of
sight
section
just
as
the
sense
of
sight
is
the
most
dignified
of
all
our
senses
it
is
also
the
most
important
in
the
criminal
court
for
most
witnesses
testify
as
to
what
they
have
seen
if
we
compare
sight
with
the
hearing
which
is
next
in
the
order
of
importance
we
discover
the
fact
that
what
is
seen
is
much
more
certain
and
trustworthy
than
what
is
heard
is
better
to
see
once
than
to
hear
ten
times
says
the
old
maxim
no
exposition
no
description
no
complication
which
the
data
of
other
senses
offer
can
present
half
as
much
as
even
a
fleeting
glance
hence
too
no
sense
can
offer
us
such
surprises
as
the
sense
of
sight
if
i
imagine
the
thunder
of
niagara
the
voice
of
lucca
the
explosion
of
a
thousand
cartridges
or
anything
else
that
i
have
not
heard
my
imagination
is
certainly
incorrect
but
it
will
differ
from
reality
only
in
degree
it
is
quite
different
with
visual
imagination
we
need
not
adduce
examples
of
magnificence
like
the
appearance
of
the
pyramids
a
tropical
light
of
a
famous
work
of
art
a
storm
at
sea
etc
the
most
insignificant
thing
ever
seen
but
variously
pictured
in
imagination
will
be
greeted
at
first
sight
with
the
words
i
imagined
it
quite
different
hence
the
tremendous
importance
of
every
local
and
material
characteristic
which
the
criminal
court
deals
with
every
one
of
us
knows
how
differently
he
has
as
a
rule
imagined
the
place
of
the
crime
to
be
how
difficult
it
is
to
arrive
at
an
understanding
with
the
witness
concerning
some
unseen
local
characteristic
and
how
many
mistakes
false
images
of
the
unseen
have
caused
whenever
i
ciceroned
anybody
through
the
graz
criminal
museum
i
was
continually
assailed
with
this
or
that
look
so
but
i
thought
it
looked
quite
different
and
the
things
which
evoke
these
exclamations
are
such
as
the
astonished
visitors
have
spoken
and
written
about
hundreds
of
times
and
often
passed
judgments
upon
the
same
situation
occurs
when
witnesses
narrate
some
observation
when
the
question
involves
the
sense
of
hearing
some
misunderstanding
may
be
popularly
assumed
but
the
people
know
little
of
optical
illusions
and
false
visual
perceptions
though
they
are
aware
that
incorrect
auditions
are
frequent
matters
of
fact
moreover
to
the
heard
object
a
large
number
of
more
or
less
certain
precautionary
judgments
are
attached
if
anybody
has
a
shot
stealthy
footsteps
crackling
flames
we
take
his
experience
always
to
be
we
do
not
do
so
when
he
assures
us
he
has
these
things
or
their
causes
then
we
take
them
barring
certain
mistakes
in
observation
to
be
indubitable
perceptions
in
which
misunderstanding
is
impossible
in
this
again
is
the
basis
for
the
distrust
with
which
we
meet
testimony
concerning
hearsay
for
we
feel
uncertain
in
the
mere
absence
of
the
person
whose
conversation
is
reported
since
his
value
can
not
be
determined
but
a
part
of
the
mistrust
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
is
not
vision
but
the
perennially
hearing
that
is
in
issue
lies
are
assigned
mainly
to
words
but
there
are
lies
which
are
visual
deceptions
maskings
illusions
visual
lies
are
however
a
diminishing
minority
in
comparison
with
the
lies
that
are
heard
the
certainty
of
the
correctness
of
vision
lies
in
its
being
tested
with
the
sense
of
touch
in
the
adaptation
of
our
bodily
sense
to
otherwise
existing
things
as
helmholtz
says
agreement
between
our
visual
perceptions
and
the
external
world
rests
at
least
in
the
most
important
matters
on
the
same
ground
that
all
our
knowledge
of
the
actual
world
rests
on
upon
the
experience
and
the
lasting
test
of
their
correctness
by
means
of
experiments
of
the
movements
of
our
this
would
almost
make
it
seem
that
the
supreme
judge
among
the
senses
is
the
touch
but
that
is
not
intended
we
know
well
enough
to
what
illusions
we
are
subject
if
we
trust
the
sense
of
touch
alone
at
the
same
time
we
must
suppose
that
the
question
here
is
one
of
the
nature
of
the
body
and
this
can
be
measured
only
by
something
similar
by
our
own
physical
characteristics
but
always
under
the
control
of
some
other
sense
especially
the
sense
of
sight
the
visual
process
itself
consists
according
to
fischer
a
compounded
series
of
results
which
succeed
each
other
with
extraordinary
rapidity
and
are
causally
related
in
this
series
the
following
elements
may
principally
be
distinguished
the
process
the
the
psychological
the
the
process
of
it
is
not
our
task
to
examine
the
first
four
elements
in
order
clearly
to
understand
the
variety
of
perception
we
have
to
deal
with
the
last
only
i
once
tried
to
explain
this
by
means
of
the
phenomenon
of
instantaneous
photographs
cinematographs
if
we
examine
one
such
representing
an
instant
in
some
quick
movement
we
will
assert
that
we
never
could
have
perceived
it
in
the
movement
itself
this
indicates
that
our
vision
is
slower
than
that
of
the
photographic
apparatus
and
hence
that
we
do
not
apprehend
the
smallest
particular
conditions
but
that
we
each
time
unconsciously
compound
a
group
of
the
smallest
conditions
and
construct
in
that
way
the
instantaneous
impressions
if
we
are
to
compound
a
great
series
of
instantaneous
impressions
in
one
galloping
step
we
must
have
condensed
and
compounded
a
number
of
them
in
order
to
get
the
image
that
we
see
with
our
eyes
as
instantaneous
we
may
therefore
say
that
the
least
instantaneous
image
we
ever
see
with
our
eyes
contains
many
parts
which
only
the
photographic
apparatus
can
grasp
suppose
we
call
these
particular
instances
a
b
c
d
e
f
g
h
i
j
k
l
m
it
is
that
the
manner
of
their
composition
must
vary
with
each
individual
one
man
may
compound
his
elements
in
groups
of
three
a
b
c
d
e
f
g
h
i
etc
another
may
proceed
in
dyads
a
b
c
d
e
f

etc
a
third
may
have
seen
an
unobservable
instant
later
but
constructs
his
image
like
the
first
man
b
c
d
l

n
etc
a
fourth
works
slowly
and
rather
inaccurately
getting
a
c
d
f

etc
such
variations
multiply
and
when
various
observers
of
the
same
event
describe
it
they
do
it
according
to
their
different
characteristics
and
the
differences
may
be
tremendous
substitute
numerals
for
letters
and
the
thing
becomes
clear
the
relative
slowness
of
our
apprehension
of
visual
elements
has
the
other
consequence
that
we
interpolate
objects
in
the
lacun√¶
of
vision
to
our
the
best
example
of
this
sort
of
thing
would
be
the
perception
of
assault
and
battery
when
ten
people
in
an
inn
see
how
a
raises
a
beer
glass
against
head
five
expect
pound
him
and
five
others
throw
if
the
glass
has
reached
head
none
of
the
ten
observers
have
seen
how
it
reached
there
but
the
first
five
take
their
oath
that
a
pounded
b
with
the
glass
and
the
other
five
that
he
threw
it
at
head
and
all
ten
have
really
seen
it
so
firmly
are
they
convinced
of
the
correctness
of
their
swift
judgment
of
expectation
now
before
we
treat
the
witness
to
some
reproach
like
untruth
inattention
silliness
or
something
equally
nice
had
better
consider
whether
his
story
is
not
true
and
whether
the
difficulty
might
not
really
lie
in
the
imperfection
of
our
own
sensory
processes
this
involves
partly
what
liebmann
has
called
vision
seeing
with
man
as
the
center
of
things
liebmann
further
asserts
we
see
things
only
in
perspective
sizes
only
from
an
angle
of
vision
varying
with
their
approach
withdrawal
and
change
of
position
but
in
no
sense
as
definite
cubical
linear
or
surface
sizes
the
apparent
size
of
an
object
we
call
an
angle
of
vision
at
a
certain
distance
but
what
indeed
is
the
different
true
size
we
know
only
relations
of
this
description
is
important
when
we
are
dealing
with
testimony
concerning
size
it
seems
obvious
that
each
witness
who
speaks
of
size
is
to
be
asked
whence
he
had
observed
it
but
at
the
same
time
a
great
many
unexpected
errors
occur
especially
when
what
is
involved
is
the
determination
of
the
size
of
an
object
in
the
same
plane
one
need
only
to
recall
the
meeting
of
railway
tracks
streets
alleys
and
to
remember
how
different
in
size
according
to
the
point
of
view
of
the
witness
various
objects
in
such
places
must
appear
everybody
knows
that
distant
things
seem
smaller
than
near
ones
but
almost
nobody
knows
what
the
difference
amounts
to
for
examples
see
lotze
psychology
leipzig
in
addition
we
often
think
that
the
clearness
of
an
object
represents
its
distance
and
suppose
that
the
first
alone
determines
the
latter
but
the
distinctness
of
objects
the
perceptibility
of
a
depends
also
upon
the
absolute
brightness
and
the
differences
in
brightness
the
latter
is
more
important
than
is
supposed
try
to
determine
how
far
away
you
can
see
a
when
the
wall
containing
the
door
is
in
the
shadow
and
when
there
is
a
window
opposite
the
a
dark
object
of
the
size
of
a
will
not
be
visible
at
one
hundredth
of
the
distance
at
which
the
is
perceived
moreover
the
difference
in
intensity
is
not
alone
in
consideration
the
intensity
of
the
object
regard
to
its
has
yet
to
be
considered
aubert
has
shown
that
the
accuracy
of
the
distinction
is
the
same
when
a
square
of
white
paper
is
looked
at
from
an
angle
of
and
when
conversely
a
square
of
black
paper
on
white
background
is
looked
at
from
an
angle
of
we
put
a
gray
paper
in
the
sunshine
it
may
become
objectively
brighter
than
white
paper
in
shadow
but
this
does
not
prevent
us
from
knowing
one
as
gray
and
the
other
as
pure
white
we
separate
the
color
of
the
object
from
the
intensity
of
the
incident
but
this
is
not
always
so
simple
inasmuch
as
we
know
in
the
case
in
hand
which
paper
is
gray
and
which
white
which
is
in
the
sunlight
and
which
in
the
shadow
but
if
these
facts
are
not
known
mistakes
often
occur
so
that
a
man
dressed
in
dark
clothes
but
in
full
light
will
be
described
as
wearing
lighter
clothes
than
one
who
wears
light
clothes
in
the
shadow
differences
of
illumination
reveal
a
number
of
phenomena
difficult
to
explain
fechner
calls
attention
to
the
appearance
of
stars
night
everybody
sees
the
stars
in
daylight
not
even
sirius
or
jupiter
is
seen
yet
the
absolute
difference
between
those
places
in
the
heavens
where
the
stars
are
and
the
environing
places
is
just
as
great
as
in
the
night
there
is
only
an
increase
in
of
still
greater
importance
to
us
is
the
circumstance
noted
but
not
explained
by
bernstein
if
in
daylight
we
look
into
a
basement
room
from
outside
we
can
perceive
nothing
almost
everything
is
dark
even
the
windows
appear
black
but
in
the
evening
if
the
room
is
ever
so
slightly
illuminated
and
we
look
into
it
from
outside
we
can
see
even
small
articles
distinctly
yet
there
was
much
intenser
light
in
the
room
in
question
during
the
day
than
the
single
illumination
of
the
night
could
have
provided
hence
it
is
asserted
the
difference
in
this
case
is
a
standard
one
in
open
day
the
eye
is
accustomed
to
the
dominating
brightness
of
daylight
beside
which
the
subdued
illumination
of
the
room
seems
relatively
dark
but
in
the
evening
one
is
in
the
dark
and
hence
even
the
little
light
of
a
single
candle
is
enough
to
enable
one
to
see
that
this
explanation
is
untrue
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
phenomenon
is
not
regulated
even
when
the
circumstances
in
question
are
made
identical
if
for
example
you
approach
the
window
in
daylight
with
your
eyes
shut
lean
your
forehead
against
the
pane
and
shut
out
the
light
on
the
sides
with
your
hands
and
then
open
your
eyes
you
see
as
little
in
the
room
as
when
you
looked
into
it
without
performing
this
ceremony
so
again
if
during
the
night
you
gazed
at
some
gas
lamp
and
then
glanced
into
the
room
there
is
only
a
few
indistinctness
at
most
after
that
the
single
candle
is
enough
the
reason
then
must
be
different
from
the
assigned
one
but
whatever
it
is
we
need
only
to
maintain
that
immediate
judgment
concerning
numerous
cases
involving
situations
of
this
kind
would
be
overhasty
it
is
often
said
that
a
witness
was
able
to
see
this
or
that
under
such
and
such
illumination
or
that
he
was
unable
to
see
it
although
he
denies
his
ability
or
inability
the
only
solution
of
such
contradictions
is
an
experiment
the
attempt
must
be
made
either
by
the
judge
or
some
reliable
third
person
to
discover
whether
under
the
same
conditions
of
illumination
anything
could
be
seen
at
the
place
in
question
or
not
as
to
may
be
seen
in
the
distance
experiment
again
is
the
best
judge
the
human
eye
is
so
very
different
in
each
man
that
even
the
acute
examination
into
what
is
known
of
the
visual
image
of
the
pleiades
shows
that
the
visual
capacity
of
classic
periods
is
no
different
from
our
own
but
still
that
there
was
great
variety
in
visual
capacity
what
enormous
visual
power
is
attributed
to
and
barbarous
peoples
especially
indians
esquimos
likewise
among
our
own
people
there
are
hunters
mountain
guides
who
can
see
so
clearly
in
the
distance
that
mere
stories
about
it
might
be
fables
in
the
bosnian
campaign
of
we
had
a
soldier
who
in
numerous
cases
of
our
great
need
to
know
the
position
in
the
distance
could
distinguish
it
with
greater
accuracy
than
we
with
our
good
he
was
the
son
of
a
in
the
styrian
mountains
and
rather
a
fool
incidentally
it
may
be
added
that
he
had
an
incredible
almost
animal
power
of
orientation
as
we
know
little
concerning
so
also
we
are
unable
to
define
what
people
can
see
inasmuch
as
their
vision
does
not
carry
they
are
compelled
to
make
intellectual
supplementations
they
observe
the
form
action
and
clothes
of
people
more
accurately
than
persons
and
hence
recognize
acquaintances
at
a
greater
distance
than
the
latter
therefore
before
an
assertion
of
a
man
is
doubted
an
experiment
should
be
made
or
at
least
another
trustworthy
person
should
be
asked
for
his
opinion
the
background
of
objects
their
movement
and
form
have
decided
effects
on
the
difference
in
visual
perception
it
is
an
ancient
observation
that
lengthy
objects
like
poles
wires
are
visible
at
incomparably
greater
distances
than
squares
of
the
same
length
in
examination
it
has
been
shown
that
the
boundary
of
accurate
perception
can
hardly
be
determined
i
know
a
place
where
under
favorable
illumination
taut
white
and
very
thin
telephone
wires
may
be
seen
at
a
distance
of
more
than
a
kilometer
and
this
demands
a
very
small
angle
of
vision
humboldt
calls
attention
to
the
large
number
of
he
assures
us
that
it
is
certainly
untrue
that
the
stars
may
be
seen
in
daylight
from
a
deep
well
from
mines
or
high
mountains
although
this
has
been
repeatedly
affirmed
since
aristotle
the
explanation
of
our
power
to
see
very
thin
long
objects
at
a
very
great
distance
is
not
our
affair
but
is
of
importance
because
it
serves
to
explain
a
number
of
similar
phenomena
spoken
of
by
witnesses
we
have
either
incorrectly
to
deny
things
we
do
not
understand
or
we
have
to
accept
a
good
deal
that
is
deniable
we
will
start
therefore
with
the
fact
that
a
point
seen
for
a
considerable
time
may
easily
disappear
from
perception
this
has
been
studied
by
helmholtz
and
others
and
he
has
shown
how
difficult
it
is
to
keep
a
point
within
the
field
of
vision
for
only
ten
or
twenty
minutes
aubert
examines
older
studies
of
the
matter
and
concludes
that
this
disappearance
or
confusion
of
an
object
is
peripheral
but
that
fixation
of
a
small
object
is
always
difficult
if
we
fix
a
distant
point
it
is
disappearing
at
every
instant
so
that
an
accurate
perception
is
not
possible
if
however
we
fix
upon
a
long
thin
body
a
wire
it
is
unnecessary
to
fix
a
single
point
and
we
may
see
the
object
with
a
wandering
eye
hence
more
clearly
helmholtz
adds
that
weakly
objective
images
disappear
like
a
wet
spot
on
warm
tin
at
the
moment
a
single
point
is
fixed
as
does
a
landscape
seen
at
night
this
last
acute
observation
is
the
basis
of
many
a
testimony
concerning
the
sudden
disappearance
of
an
object
at
night
it
has
helped
me
in
many
an
examination
and
always
to
advantage
in
this
connection
the
of
the
illuminating
power
is
not
to
be
forgotten
according
to
helmholtz
the
power
of
the
full
moon
is
not
more
than
that
of
a
candle
twelve
feet
away
and
how
much
people
claim
to
have
seen
by
moonlight
vincent
says
that
a
man
may
be
recognized
during
the
first
quarter
at
from
two
to
six
meters
at
full
moon
at
from
seven
to
ten
meters
and
at
the
brightest
full
moon
an
intimate
may
be
recognized
at
from
fifteen
to
sixteen
meters
this
is
approximately
correct
and
indicates
how
much
moonlight
is
in
addition
to
the
natural
differences
of
sight
there
are
also
those
artificially
created
how
much
we
may
help
ourselves
by
skilful
distinctions
we
can
recognize
in
the
and
business
of
reading
a
confused
handwriting
we
aim
to
weaken
our
in
favor
of
our
imagination
so
to
reduce
the
clearness
of
the
former
as
to
be
able
to
test
upon
it
in
some
degree
a
larger
number
of
images
we
hold
the
away
from
us
look
at
it
askant
with
contracted
eyebrows
in
different
lights
and
finally
we
read
it
again
the
converse
occurs
if
we
have
seen
something
with
a
magnifying
glass
we
later
recognize
details
without
its
help
definite
conditions
may
bring
to
light
very
great
distinctions
a
body
close
to
the
face
or
in
the
middle
distance
looks
different
according
as
one
eye
or
both
be
used
in
examining
it
this
is
an
old
story
and
explains
the
queer
descriptions
we
receive
of
such
objects
as
weapons
and
the
like
which
were
suddenly
held
before
the
face
of
the
deponent
in
cases
of
murderous
assault
it
is
certain
that
most
uncanny
stories
are
told
later
explained
by
fear
or
total
confusion
or
intentional
dishonesty
but
really
to
be
explained
by
nothing
more
than
actual
optical
processes
i
do
not
believe
that
binocular
vision
is
of
much
importance
in
the
law
i
know
of
no
case
in
ordinary
vision
where
it
matters
whether
one
or
both
eyes
have
been
used
it
is
correct
to
assert
that
one
side
or
the
other
of
a
vertically
held
hand
will
be
clearer
if
before
looking
at
it
with
both
eyes
you
look
at
it
with
one
or
the
other
but
this
makes
little
difference
to
our
purpose
it
must
be
maintained
that
a
part
of
what
we
see
is
seen
with
one
eye
only
if
i
look
at
the
sky
and
cover
one
eye
with
my
hand
a
certain
portion
of
the
heaven
disappears
but
i
observe
no
alteration
in
the
remaining
portion
when
i
cover
the
other
eye
other
stars
disappear
therefore
in
binocular
vision
certain
things
are
seen
with
one
eye
only
this
may
be
of
importance
when
an
effect
has
been
observed
first
with
both
eyes
then
with
one
raising
the
question
of
the
difference
in
observation
but
such
a
question
is
rare
there
are
two
additional
things
to
consider
the
first
is
the
problem
of
the
influence
of
custom
on
increasing
visual
power
in
darkness
this
power
is
as
a
rule
undervalued
no
animal
naturally
can
see
anything
in
complete
darkness
but
it
is
almost
unbelievable
how
much
can
be
seen
with
a
very
little
light
here
again
prisoners
tell
numerous
stories
concerning
their
vision
in
subterranean
prisons
one
saw
so
well
as
to
be
able
to
throw
seven
needles
about
the
cell
and
then
to
find
them
again
another
the
naturalist
was
able
so
accurately
to
observe
the
spiders
in
his
cell
as
to
make
the
observation
the
basis
for
his
famous
aubert
tells
of
his
having
had
to
stay
in
a
room
so
dark
as
to
make
it
necessary
for
others
to
feel
their
way
but
nevertheless
being
able
to
read
books
without
detection
because
the
others
could
not
see
the
books
how
quickly
we
get
used
to
darkness
and
how
much
more
we
see
after
a
while
is
well
known
it
is
also
certain
that
the
longer
you
are
in
darkness
the
more
you
see
you
see
more
at
the
end
of
a
day
than
after
a
few
hours
and
at
the
end
of
a
year
still
more
the
eye
perhaps
changes
in
some
degree
for
just
this
purpose
but
a
prolonged
use
of
the
visual
mechanism
tends
to
hypertrophy
or
atrophy
as
the
eyes
of
fishes
show
it
is
well
in
any
event
to
be
careful
about
contradicting
the
testimonies
of
patients
who
have
long
lived
in
the
dark
concerning
what
they
have
seen
the
power
to
see
in
the
dark
is
so
various
that
without
examination
much
injustice
may
be
done
some
people
see
almost
nothing
at
twilight
others
see
at
night
as
well
as
cats
and
in
court
these
differences
must
be
established
and
experimentally
verified
the
second
important
element
is
the
innervation
of
the
muscles
in
consequence
of
movement
merely
seen
so
stricker
points
out
that
the
sight
of
a
man
carrying
a
heavy
load
made
him
feel
tension
in
the
muscles
involved
and
again
when
he
saw
soldiers
exercising
he
almost
was
compelled
openly
to
act
as
they
in
every
case
the
muscular
innervation
followed
the
visual
stimulus
this
may
sound
improbable
but
nevertheless
everybody
to
some
degree
does
the
identical
things
and
at
law
the
fact
may
be
of
importance
in
cases
of
assault
and
battery
since
i
learned
it
i
have
repeatedly
observed
in
such
cases
from
harmless
assault
to
murder
that
people
although
they
had
not
been
seen
to
deal
any
blows
were
often
accused
of
complicity
simply
because
they
were
making
suspicious
movements
that
led
to
the
following
inference
stuck
their
hands
into
their
trousers
pocket
looking
for
a
knife
clenched
their
fists
looked
as
if
they
were
about
to
jump
swung
their
in
many
such
cases
it
appeared
that
the
suspects
were
harmless
spectators
who
were
simply
more
obvious
in
their
innervation
of
the
muscles
involved
in
the
assault
they
were
eagerly
witnessing
this
fact
should
be
well
kept
in
mind
it
may
relieve
many
an
innocent
section
concerning
color
vision
only
a
few
facts
will
be
mentioned
it
will
be
worth
while
first
of
all
to
consider
whether
color
exists
liebmann
holds
that
if
all
the
people
were
blind
to
red
red
would
not
exist
red
is
some
cervical
phantasy
so
are
light
sound
warmth
taste
etc
with
other
senses
we
have
another
world
according
to
helmholtz
it
is
senseless
to
ask
whether
cinnabar
is
red
as
we
see
it
or
is
only
so
as
an
optical
illusion
sensation
of
red
is
the
normal
reaction
of
normally
constructed
eyes
to
light
reflected
from
cinnabar
a
person
blind
to
red
will
see
cinnabar
as
black
or
a
dark
grayish
yellow
and
this
is
the
correct
reaction
for
these
abnormal
eyes
but
he
needs
to
know
that
his
eyes
are
different
from
those
of
other
people
in
itself
the
sensation
is
neither
more
correct
nor
less
correct
than
any
other
even
though
those
who
can
see
red
are
in
the
great
majority
the
red
color
of
cinnabar
exists
as
such
only
in
so
far
as
there
are
eyes
which
are
similar
to
those
of
the
majority
of
mankind
as
such
light
reflected
from
cinnabar
may
not
properly
be
called
red
it
is
red
only
for
especial
kinds
of
this
is
so
unconditionally
incorrect
that
an
impartial
judge
of
photography
says
that
everything
that
normal
eyes
call
violet
and
blue
is
very
bright
and
everything
they
call
green
and
red
is
very
dark
the
person
will
see
as
equal
certain
natural
reds
greens
and
both
in
intensity
and
shadow
but
on
the
photograph
he
will
be
able
to
distinguish
the
differences
in
brightness
caused
by
these
three
otherwise
identical
colors
we
may
therefore
assume
that
colors
possess
differences
and
that
these
objective
differences
are
perceived
even
by
persons
of
normal
vision
but
whether
i
am
able
to
sense
the
same
effect
in
red
that
another
senses
and
whether
i
should
not
call
red
blue
if
i
had
the
of
another
is
as
impossible
to
discover
as
it
is
useless
when
the
question
of
color
is
raised
therefore
we
will
try
to
discover
only
whether
the
person
in
question
has
normal
or
what
the
nature
and
degree
of
his
abnormality
may
be
it
is
not
unimportant
to
know
whether
single
tints
are
recognizable
in
the
distance
there
have
been
several
examinations
of
this
fact
aubert
constructed
double
squares
of
ten
millimeters
and
determined
the
angle
of
vision
at
which
the
color
as
such
could
be
seen
his
results
were
color
of
the
white
black
square
background
white
red
light
green
dirty
red
blue
brown
light
blue
orange
gray
rose
yellow
it
is
interesting
to
notice
that
the
angle
for
blue
on
a
white
background
is
almost
nine
times
that
for
white
orange
or
yellow
on
a
black
background
in
cases
where
colors
are
of
importance
therefore
it
will
be
necessary
to
discover
the
color
and
the
nature
of
its
background
before
the
accuracy
of
the
witness
can
be
established
it
is
well
known
that
in
the
diminution
of
brightnesses
red
disappears
before
blue
and
that
at
night
when
all
colors
have
disappeared
the
blue
of
heaven
is
still
visible
so
if
anybody
asserts
that
he
has
been
able
to
see
the
blue
of
a
coat
but
not
his
trousers
his
statement
is
possibly
true
while
the
converse
would
be
untrue
but
there
are
no
reliable
or
consonant
accounts
of
the
order
in
which
colors
disappear
in
increasing
darkness
the
knowledge
of
this
order
would
help
a
great
deal
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
the
retina
will
not
see
red
at
the
periphery
because
there
are
no
red
rods
there
a
stick
of
red
sealing
wax
drawn
across
the
eye
from
right
to
left
appears
at
the
periphery
of
the
visual
field
to
be
black
if
then
a
witness
has
not
looked
right
at
a
definitely
red
object
and
has
seen
it
askance
he
has
certainly
not
observed
its
color
the
experiment
may
be
made
by
anybody
according
to
quantz
objects
in
less
refractable
colors
red
orange
yellow
and
purple
look
to
bigger
against
white
while
blue
and
violet
objects
appear
from
to
smaller
dark
and
objects
seem
longer
bright
and
horizontal
seem
wider
and
these
facts
are
significant
when
witnesses
judge
of
size
if
colors
are
observed
through
small
openings
especially
through
very
small
holes
the
nuances
become
essentially
different
and
green
may
even
seem
colorless
according
to
aubert
sparkle
consists
of
the
fact
that
one
point
in
a
body
is
very
bright
while
the
brightness
diminishes
almost
absolutely
from
that
point
a
glancing
wire
has
a
very
narrow
bright
line
with
deep
shadows
on
each
side
a
ball
of
mercury
in
a
thermometer
a
shining
point
and
then
deep
shadow
when
we
see
this
we
say
it
sparkles
because
we
unite
it
with
a
number
of
similar
observations
it
is
therefore
conceivable
that
at
a
great
distance
under
conditions
of
sharp
or
accidental
illuminations
we
are
likely
to
see
things
as
sparkling
which
do
not
do
so
in
the
least
with
the
concept
moreover
we
tend
to
unite
at
least
under
certain
circumstances
definite
images
and
hence
are
often
seen
in
places
where
there
were
only
quite
harmless
dull
objects
so
also
coins
are
seen
to
sparkle
where
really
there
are
none
section
blind
everybody
knows
what
the
blind
spot
is
and
every
psychology
and
physiology
talks
about
it
but
as
a
rule
it
is
identified
only
with
the
little
point
and
the
tiny
cross
pictured
in
the
and
it
is
supposed
that
it
does
not
much
matter
if
the
little
cross
under
certain
circumstances
can
not
be
seen
but
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
size
of
the
blind
spot
increases
with
the
distance
so
that
at
a
fairly
great
distance
possibly
half
the
length
of
a
room
the
blind
spot
becomes
so
great
that
a
head
may
disappear
from
the
field
of
vision
according
to
helmholtz
effect
of
the
blind
spot
is
very
significant
if
we
make
a
little
cross
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
then
a
spot
the
size
of
a
pea
two
inches
to
the
right
and
if
we
look
at
the
cross
with
the
left
eye
closed
the
spot
disappears
the
size
of
the
blind
spot
is
large
enough
to
cover
in
the
heavens
a
plate
which
has
twelve
times
the
diameter
of
the
moon
it
may
cover
a
human
face
at
a
distance
of
but
we
do
not
observe
this
because
we
generally
fill
out
the
void
if
we
see
a
line
in
the
place
in
question
we
see
it
unbroken
because
we
know
it
to
be
so
and
therefore
supply
the
missing
a
number
of
experiments
have
been
made
with
more
or
less
success
to
explain
the
blind
spot
it
is
enough
for
us
to
agree
that
we
see
habitually
with
both
eyes
and
that
the
as
big
as
a
disappears
only
when
we
look
at
the
cross
but
when
we
fix
our
eyes
on
anything
we
pay
attention
to
that
only
and
to
nothing
else
and
it
is
indifferent
to
us
if
an
uninteresting
object
disappears
so
that
the
moment
we
begin
to
care
about
the
as
large
as
a
pea
it
is
immediately
to
hand
and
needs
no
imaginative
completion
if
it
be
objected
that
fixing
with
the
eyes
and
being
interested
are
not
identical
we
reply
that
a
distinction
is
made
only
in
experiment
you
fix
one
point
and
are
interested
in
the
other
because
you
expect
it
to
disappear
and
this
experiment
as
anybody
will
immediately
recognize
has
its
peculiar
difficulty
because
it
requires
much
concentration
not
to
look
at
the
point
which
interests
us
this
never
happens
in
the
daily
life
and
it
will
not
be
easy
to
fix
a
point
which
is
not
interesting
at
the
same
time
there
are
conceivable
cases
in
which
objects
seen
askance
may
be
of
importance
and
where
the
visual
fixation
of
a
single
point
will
not
reveal
every
reflection
that
fell
on
the
blind
spot
i
have
not
met
with
a
practical
case
in
which
some
fact
or
testimony
could
be
explained
only
by
the
blind
spot
but
such
cases
are
conceivable
section
c
the
sense
of
hearing
we
have
two
problems
with
regard
to
sound
whether
the
witnesses
have
heard
correctly
and
whether
we
hear
them
correctly
between
both
witnesses
and
ourselves
there
are
again
other
factors
correct
comprehension
faithful
memory
the
activity
of
the
imagination
the
variety
of
influences
the
degree
of
personal
integrity
but
most
important
is
the
consideration
whether
the
witness
has
heard
correctly
as
a
general
thing
we
must
deny
in
most
cases
completely
accurate
reproduction
of
what
witnesses
have
heard
in
this
connection
dealing
with
questions
of
honor
is
instructive
if
the
question
is
the
recall
of
slander
the
terms
of
it
will
be
as
various
as
the
number
of
witnesses
we
discover
that
the
sense
the
tendency
of
slander
is
not
easily
mistaken
at
least
if
it
is
i
have
not
observed
it
the
witness
will
confuse
the
words
and
again
the
words
etc
but
he
will
not
say
that
he
has
heard
where
what
was
said
was
he
simply
has
observed
that
a
has
insulted
b
with
an
epithet
of
moral
turpitude
or
of
stupidity
and
under
examination
he
inserts
an
appropriate
term
often
people
hear
only
according
to
meanings
and
hence
the
difficulty
of
getting
them
to
reproduce
verbally
and
directly
something
said
by
a
third
person
they
always
engage
upon
indirect
narration
because
they
have
heard
only
the
meaning
not
the
words
memory
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
matter
for
when
in
examination
a
witness
is
requested
to
reproduce
directly
what
he
has
just
heard
he
will
reproduce
no
more
than
the
sense
not
the
words
not
to
do
so
requires
an
unusual
degree
of
intelligence
and
training
now
if
the
witnesses
only
reproduced
the
actual
meaning
of
what
they
heard
no
harm
would
be
done
but
they
tell
us
only
what
they
to
be
the
meaning
and
hence
we
get
a
good
many
mistakes
it
does
seem
as
if
uneducated
and
people
are
able
to
shut
their
ears
to
all
things
they
do
not
understand
even
purely
sensory
perception
is
organized
according
to
intelligent
capacity
if
this
is
kept
in
mind
it
will
be
possible
correctly
to
interpret
testimonies
in
those
difficult
instances
in
which
one
man
narrates
what
he
has
heard
from
another
concerning
his
own
statement
and
where
it
might
be
quite
impossible
to
judge
the
nature
and
culture
of
this
third
person
there
are
a
few
other
conditions
to
consider
besides
if
we
have
to
discover
a
hearing
power
or
his
hearing
power
under
definite
conditions
it
is
best
never
to
depend
in
even
slightly
important
cases
on
vocal
tests
merely
the
examination
must
be
made
by
experts
and
if
the
case
is
really
subtle
it
must
be
made
under
the
same
circumstances
of
place
and
condition
and
with
the
same
people
as
in
the
original
situation
otherwise
nothing
certain
can
be
learned
the
determination
of
auditory
power
is
however
insufficient
for
this
power
varies
with
the
degree
any
individual
can
distinguish
a
single
definite
tone
among
many
hear
it
alone
and
retain
it
and
this
varies
not
only
with
the
individual
but
also
with
the
time
the
place
the
voice
etc
in
my
and
in
three
neighboring
rooms
i
have
each
of
which
is
running
the
doors
of
the
room
are
open
right
and
left
at
night
when
everything
is
quiet
i
can
sometimes
hear
the
ticking
of
each
one
of
these
clocks
immediately
isolate
one
completely
and
listen
to
that
so
that
the
ticking
of
the
other
three
completely
disappears
then
again
i
may
kindly
command
myself
not
to
hear
this
ticking
but
to
hear
one
of
the
other
three
and
i
do
so
though
i
fail
to
hear
two
clocks
together
at
just
the
same
instant
on
another
day
under
similar
circumstances
i
completely
fail
in
this
attempt
either
i
hear
none
of
the
clocks
in
particular
or
only
for
a
short
time
which
results
in
the
being
again
lost
in
the
general
noise
or
i
do
hear
the
ticking
of
one
clock
but
never
of
that
which
i
have
chosen
to
hear
this
incident
is
variously
explicable
and
the
experiment
may
be
repeated
with
various
persons
it
indicates
that
auditory
capacity
is
exceedingly
differentiated
and
that
there
is
no
justification
for
aprioristic
doubt
of
especial
powers
it
is
however
admittedly
difficult
to
say
how
experiments
can
be
made
under
control
there
are
still
a
few
more
marvels
it
is
repeatedly
asserted
by
tyndall
that
a
comparatively
large
number
of
people
do
not
hear
high
tones
like
the
chirping
of
crickets
although
the
normal
hearing
of
such
people
is
acute
others
again
easily
sense
deep
tones
but
distinguish
them
with
difficulty
because
they
retain
only
a
roll
or
roar
but
do
not
hear
the
individual
tones
and
generally
almost
all
people
have
difficulty
in
making
a
correct
valuation
of
the
direction
of
sound
wundt
says
that
we
locate
powerful
sounds
in
front
of
us
and
are
generally
better
able
to
judge
right
and
left
than
before
and
behind
these
data
which
are
for
us
quite
important
have
been
subjected
to
many
tests
statement
has
been
confirmed
by
various
experiments
which
have
shown
that
sound
to
the
right
and
the
left
are
best
distinguished
and
sounds
in
front
and
below
in
front
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
and
below
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
are
least
easily
distinguished
among
the
experimenters
were
preyer
arnheim
kries
m√ºnsterberg
all
these
experiments
indicate
certain
constant
tendencies
to
definite
mistakes
sounds
in
front
are
often
mistaken
for
sounds
behind
and
felt
to
be
higher
than
their
natural
again
it
is
generally
asserted
that
binaural
hearing
is
of
great
importance
for
the
recognition
of
the
direction
of
sound
with
one
ear
this
recognition
is
much
more
difficult
this
may
be
verified
by
the
fact
that
we
turn
our
heads
here
and
there
as
though
to
compare
directions
whenever
we
want
to
make
sure
of
the
direction
of
sound
in
this
regard
too
a
number
of
effective
experiments
have
been
made
when
it
is
necessary
to
determine
whether
the
witness
deposes
correctly
concerning
the
direction
of
sound
it
is
best
to
get
the
official
physician
to
find
out
whether
he
hears
with
both
ears
and
whether
he
hears
equally
well
with
both
it
is
observed
that
persons
who
hear
excellently
with
both
ears
are
unfortunate
in
judging
the
direction
of
sound
others
again
are
very
skilful
in
this
matter
and
may
possibly
get
their
skill
from
practice
sense
of
locality
etc
but
in
any
case
certainty
can
be
obtained
only
by
experimentation
with
regard
to
the
conduction
of
sound
it
is
to
be
noted
that
sound
is
carried
astonishingly
far
by
means
of
compact
bodies
the
distance
at
which
the
trotting
of
horses
the
thunder
of
cannons
may

laying
the

close
to
the
ground
is
a
in
fiction
therefore
if
a
witness
testifies
to
have
heard
something
at
a
great
distance
in
this
way
or
by
having
laid
his
ear
to
the
wall
it
is
well
not
to
set
the
evidence
aside
although
it
will
be
difficult
in
such
cases
to
make
determinative
experiments
it
is
useful
to
do
so
because
the
limits
of
his
capacity
are
then
approximated
under
certain
circumstances
it
may
be
of
importance
to
know
what
can
be
heard
when
the
head
or
at
least
the
ear
is
under
water
the
experiment
may
be
made
in
the
by
setting
the
back
of
the
head
under
water
so
that
the
ears
are
completely
covered
but
the
mouth
and
the
eyes
are
free
the
mouth
must
be
kept
closed
so
that
there
shall
be
no
intrusion
of
sound
through
the
eustachian
tube
in
this
condition
practically
no
sound
can
be
heard
which
must
pass
through
the

therefore
anybody
even
immediately
next
to
you
speaks
ever
so
loud
you
can
hear
only
a
minimum
of
what
he
says
on
the
other
hand
noises
that
are
conducted
by
compact
bodies
the
walls
the
bath
and
the
water
can
be
heard
with
astonishing
distinctness
especially
if
the
bath
is
not
detachable
but
is
built
into
the
wall
then
if
some
remote
part
of
the
building
some
wall
is
knocked
the
noise
is
heard
perfectly
well
although
somebody
standing
near
the
bath
hears
nothing
whatever
this
may
be
of
importance
in
cases
of
accident
in
certain
attempts
at
drowning
people
and
in
accidental
there
are
several
things
to
note
with
regard
to
deaf
persons
or
such
as
have
difficulty
with
their
hearing
according
to
fechner
deafness
begins
with
the
inability
to
hear
high
tones
and
ends
with
the
inability
to
hear
deep
ones
so
that
it
often
happens
that
complainants
are
not
believed
because
they
still
hear
deep
tones
again
there
are
mistakes
which
rise
from
the
fact
that
the
deaf
often
learn
a
great
deal
from
the
movements
of
the
lips
and
the
reading
of
these
movements
has
become
the
basis
of
the
of
deaf
mutes
there
are
stories
of
deaf
mutes
who
have
perceived
more
in
this
way
and
by
means
of
their
necessary
and
synthesis
of
impressions
than
persons
with
good
hearing
power
the
differences
that
age
makes
in
hearing
are
of
importance
bezold
has
examined
a
large
number
of
human
ears
of
different
ages
and
indicates
that
after
the
fiftieth
year
there
is
not
only
a
successive
decrease
in
the
number
of
the
approximately
but
there
is
a
successively
growing
increase
in
the
degree
of
auditory
limitation
which
the
ear
experiences
with
increasing
age
the
results
are
more
surprising
than
is
supposed
not
one
of
people
over
fifty
years
of
age
could
understand
conversational
speech
at
a
distance
of
sixteen
meters
understood
it
at
a
distance
of
eight
to
sixteen
meters
of
school
children
of
them
from
seven
to
eighteen
understood
it
at
a
distance
of
meters
plus
and
at
a
distance
of
from
to
meters
the
percentage
then
is
for
people
over
fifty
as
against
of
people
over
seven
and
under
old
women
can
hear
better
than
old
men
at
a
distance
of
to
meters
the
proportion
of
women
to
men
who
could
hear
was
to
the
converse
is
true
of
children
for
at
a
distance
of
meters
and
more
the
percentage
of
boys
was
and
girls
the
reason
for
this
inversion
of
the
relation
lies
in
the
harmful
influences
of
manual
labor
and
other
noisy
occupations
of
men
these
comparisons
may
be
of
importance
when
the
question
is
raised
as
to
how
much
more
a
witness
may
have
heard
than
one
of
a
different
age
section
d
the
sense
of
taste
the
sense
of
taste
is
rarely
of
legal
importance
but
when
it
does
come
into
importance
it
is
regularly
very
significant
because
it
involves
in
the
main
problems
of
poisoning
the
explanation
of
such
cases
is
rarely
easy
and
certain
first
of
all
because
we
can
not
without
difficulty
get
into
a
position
of
testing
the
delicacy
and
acuteness
of
any
individual
sense
of
taste
where
such
testing
is
quite
simple
with
regard
to
seeing
and
hearing
at
the
same
time
it
is
necessary
when
tests
are
made
to
depend
upon
general
and
rarely
constant
impressions
since
very
few
people
mean
the
same
thing
by
stinging
prickly
metallic
and
burning
tastes
even
though
the
ordinary
terms
sweet
sour
bitter
and
salty
may
be
accepted
as
approximately
constant
the
least
that
can
be
done
when
a
taste
is
defined
as
good
bad
excellent
or
disgusting
is
to
test
it
in
every
possible
direction
with
regard
to
the
age
habits
health
and
intelligence
of
the
taster
for
all
of
these
exercise
great
influence
on
his
values
similarly
necessary
are
valuations
like
flat
sweetish
contractile
limey
pappy
sandy
which
are
all
dictated
by
almost
momentary
variations
in
but
if
any
denotation
is
to
be
depended
upon
and
in
the
end
some
one
has
to
be
it
is
necessary
to
determine
whether
the
perception
has
been
made
with
the
end
or
the
root
of
the
tongue
longet
following
the

alkaloid
in
such

exercise
considerable

it
will
be
important
to
call
in
the
physician
dehn
is
led
by
his
experiments
to
the
conclusion
that

is
finer
than
and
again
that
that

finer

section
e
the
sense
of
smell
the
sense
of
smell
would
be
of
great
importance
for
legal
consideration
if
it
could
get
the
study
it
deserves
it
may
be
said
that
many
men
have
more
acute
olfactory
powers
than
they
know
and
that
they
may
learn
more
by
means
of
them
than
by
means
of
the
other
senses
the
sense
of
smell
has
little
especial
practical
importance
it
only
serves
to
supply
a
great
many
people
with
occasional
disagreeable
impressions
and
what
men
fail
to
find
especially
necessary
they
do
not
easily
make
use
of
the
utility
of
smell
would
be
great
because
it
is
accurate
and
hence
powerful
in
its
associative
quality
but
it
is
rarely
attended
to
even
when
the
associations
are
awakened
they
are
not
ascribed
to
the
sense
of
smell
but
are
said
to
be
accidental
i
offer
one
example
only
of
this
common
fact
when
i
was
a
child
of
less
than
eight
years
i
once
visited
with
my
parents
a
priest
who
was
a
of
my
the
day
spent
in
the
parsonage
contained
nothing
remarkable
so
that
all
these
years
i
have
not
even
thought
of
it
a
short
time
ago
all
the
details
i
encountered
on
that
day
occurred
to
me
very
vividly
and
inasmuch
as
this
sudden
memory
seemed
baseless
i
studied
carefully
the
cause
of
its
occurrence
without
success
a
short
time
later
i
had
the
same
experience
and
at
the
same
place
this
was
a
clew
and
i
then
recalled
that
i
had
undertaken
a
voyage
of
discovery
with
the
small
niece
of
the
parson
and
had
been
led
into
a
fruit
cellar
there
i
found
great
heaps
of
apples
laid
on
straw
and
on
the
wall
a
considerable
number
of
the
hunting
boots
of
the
parson
the
mixed
odors
of
apple
straw
and
boots
constituted
a
unique
and
long
unsmelled
perfume
which
had
sunk
deep
into
my
memory
and
as
i
passed
a
room
which
contained
the
same
elements
of
odor
all
those
things
that
were
associated
with
that
odor
at
the
time
i
first
smelt
it
immediately
recurred
everybody
experiences
such
associations
in
great
number
and
in
examinations
a
little
trouble
will
bring
them
up
especially
when
the
question
deals
with
remote
events
and
a
witness
tells
about
some
idea
of
his
if
the
accident
is
considered
to
be
an
association
and
studied
in
the
light
of
a
memory
of
odor
one
may
often
succeed
in
finding
the
right
clew
and
making
progress
but
accurate
as
the
sense
of
smell
is
it
receives
as
a
rule
little
consideration
and
when
some
question
concerning
smell
is
put
the
answer
is
generally
negative
yet
in
no
case
may
a
matter
be
so
easily
determined
as
in
this
one
one
may
without
making
even
the
slightest
suggestion
succeed
in
getting
the
witness
to
confess
that
he
had
smelled
something
incidentally
one
may
succeed
in
awakening
such
impressions
as
have
not
quite
crossed
the
threshold
of
consciousness
or
have
been
subdued
and
diverted
suppose
that
a
witness
has
smelled
fire
but
inasmuch
as
he
was
otherwise
engaged
was
not
fully
conscious
of
it
or
did
not
quite
notice
it
or
explained
it
to
himself
as
some
kitchen
odor
or
the
odor
of
a
bad
cigar
such
perceptions
are
later
forgotten
but
with
proper
questioning
are
faithfully
and
completely
brought
to
memory
obviously
much
depends
on
whether
anybody
likes
certain
delicate
odors
or
not
as
a
rule
it
may
be
held
that
a
delicate
sense
of
smell
is
frequently
associated
with
nervousness
again
people
with
broad
nostrils
and
well
developed
foreheads
who
keep
their
mouths
closed
most
of
the
time
have
certainly
a
delicate
sense
of
smell
people
of
lymphatic
nature
with
veiled
unclear
voices
do
not
have
a
keen
sense
of
smell
and
still
duller
is
that
of
snufflers
and
habitual
smokers
up
to
a
certain
degree
practice
may
do
much
but
too
much
of
it
dulls
the
sense
of
smell
butchers
tobacconists
perfumers
not
only
fail
to
perceive
the
odors
which
dominate
their
shops
their
sense
of
smell
has
been
dulled
anyway
on
the
other
hand
those
who
have
to
make
delicate
distinctions
by
means
of
their
sense
like
apothecaries
tea
dealers
brewers
wine
tasters
etc
achieve
great
skill
i
remember
that
one
time
when
i
had
in
court
to
deal
almost
exclusively
with
gypsies
i
could
immediately
smell
whether
any
gypsies
had
been
brought
there
during
the
night
very
nervous
persons
develop
a
delicateness
and
acuteness
of
smell
which
other
persons
do
not
even
imagine
now
we
have
no
real
knowledge
of
how
odors
arise
that
they
are
not
the
results
of
the
radiation
of
very
tiny
parts
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
certain
bodies
smell
though
they
are
known
not
to
give
off
particles
zinc
for
example
and
such
things
as
copper
sulphur
and
iron
have
individual
odors
the
latter
particularly
when
it
is
kept
polished
by
a
great
deal
of
friction
in
the
cases
of
chains
kept
in
the
pocket
in
defining
the
impressions
of
smell
great
difficulties
occur
even
normal
individuals
often
have
a
passionate
love
for
odors
that
are
either
indifferent
or
disgusting
to
others
rotten
apples
wet
sponges
and
the
odor
of
a
garlic
assafoetida
very
ripe
game
the
same
individual
finds
the
odor
of
food
beautiful
when
hungry
pleasant
when
and
unendurable
when
he
has
migraine
it
would
be
necessary
to
make
an
accurate
description
of
these
differences
and
all
their
accompanying
circumstances
with
regard
to
sex
the
sense
of
smell
according
to
lombroso
is
twice
as
fine
in
men
as
in
women
this
is
verified
by
pupils
ottolenghi
and
sicard
roncoroni
and
francis
galton
experience
of
daily
life
does
not
confirm
this
though
many
smokers
among
men
rarely
possess
acute
sense
of
smell
and
this
raises
the
percentage
considerably
in
favor
of
women
section
f
the
sense
of
touch
i
combine
for
the
sake
of
simplicity
the
senses
of
location
pressure
temperature
under
the
general
expression
sense
of
touch
the
problem
this
sense
raises
is
no
light
one
because
many
witnesses
tell
of
perceptions
made
in
the
dark
or
when
they
were
otherwise
unable
to
see
and
because
much
is
perceived
by
means
of
this
sense
in
assaults
wounds
and
other
contacts
in
most
cases
such
witnesses
have
been
unable
to
regard
the
touched
parts
of
their
bodies
so
that
we
have
to
depend
upon
this
alone
full
certainty
is
possible
only
when
sight
and
touch
have
worked
together
and
rectified
one
another
it
has
been
shown
that
the
conception
of
the
third
dimension
can
not
be
obtained
through
the
sense
of
sight
at
the
beginning
we
owe
the
perception
of
this
dimension
only
to
touch
and
later
on
to
experience
and
habit
the
truth
of
this
statement
is
confirmed
by
the
reports
of
persons
who
born
blind
have
gained
sight
some
were
unable
to
distinguish
by
means
of
mere
sight
a
silver
from
a
large
key
they
could
only
tell
them
to
be
different
things
and
recognized
their
nature
only
after
they
had
felt
them
on
the
other
hand
the
deceptive
possibilities
in
touch
are
seen
in
the
mistakes
to
which
one
is
subjected
in
blind
touching
at
the
same
time
practice
leads
to
considerable
accuracy
in
touch
and
on
many
occasions
the
sense
is
trusted
more
than
sight
whenever
we
test
the
delicacy
of
an
object
with
our
the
fineness
of
paper
leather
the
smoothness
of
a
surface
the
presence
of
points
are
always
tested
with
the
fingers
so
that
if
a
witness
assures
us
that
this
or
that
was
very
smooth
or
that
this
surface
was
very
raw
we
must
regularly
ask
him
whether
he
had
tested
the
quality
by
touching
it
with
his
fingers
and
we
are
certain
only
if
he
says
yes
whoever
has
to
depend
much
on
the
sense
of
touch
increases
its
field
of
perception
as
we
know
from
the
delicacy
of
the
sense
in
blind
people
the
statements
of
the
blind
concerning
their
contact
sensations
may
be
believed
even
when
they
seem
improbable
there
are
blind
persons
who
may
feel
the
very
color
of
fabrics
because
the
various
pigments
and
their
medium
give
a
different
to
the
cloth
they
color
in
another
direction
again
it
is
the
deaf
who
have
especial
power
so
we
are
assured
by
abercrombie
that
in
his
medical
practice
he
had
frequently
observed
how
deaf
people
will
perceive
the
roll
of
an
approaching
wagon
or
the
approach
of
a
person
long
before
people
with
good
hearing
do
so
for
a
long
time
i
owned
an
angora
which
like
all
angoras
was
completely
deaf
and
her
deafness
had
been
tested
by
physicians
nevertheless
if
the
animal
was
dozing
somewhere
and
anybody
came
near
it
she
would
immediately
notice
his
steps
and
would
distinguish
them
for
she
would
jump
up
frightened
if
the
newcomer
was
unknown
and
would
stretch
herself
with
pleasure
in
the
expectation
of
petting
if
she
felt
a
friend
coming
she
would
sense
the
lightest
touch
on
the
object
she
occupied
bench
sofa
and
she
was
especially
sensitive
to
very
light
scratching
of
the
object
such
sensitivity
is
duplicated
frequently
in
persons
who
are
hard
of
hearing
and
whom
therefore
we
are
likely
to
doubt
the
sense
of
touch
is
moreover
improved
not
only
by
practice
but
also
by
the
training
of
the
muscles
stricker
asserts
that
he
has
frequently
noticed
that
the
observational
capacity
of
individuals
who
make
much
use
of
their
muscles
is
greater
than
among
persons
whose
habits
are
sedentary
this
does
not
contradict
the
truth
established
by
many
experiments
that
the
educated
man
is
more
sensitive
in
all
directions
than
the
uneducated
again
women
have
a
better
developed
sense
of
touch
than
men
the
and
the
being
equivalent
in
both
sexes
on
these
special
forms
of
the
injections
of
various
kinds
have
decided
influence
the
injection
of
morphine
reduces
the
in
the
skin
reduces
sensibility
and
alcohol
is
swift
and
considerable
in
its
effects
according
to
reichenbach
some
sensitives
are
extreme
in
their
feeling
the
best
of
them
notice
immediately
the
approach
and
relative
position
of
people
or
the
presence
of
another
in
a
dark
room
that
very
nervous
people
frequently
feel
air
pressure
fine
vibrations
is
perfectly
true
and
this
and
other
facts
show
the
great
variety
of
touch
impressions
that
may
be
distinguished
the
sense
of
temperature
has
a
comparatively
high
development
and
more
so
in
women
than
in
men
at
the
lips
and
with
the
tips
of
the
fingers
differences
of
of
a
degree
are
perceived
but
where
an
absolute
valuation
and
not
a
difference
is
to
be
perceived
the
mean
variation
generally
is
not
much
less
than
degrees
a
temperature
of
degrees
will
be
estimated
at
from
to
degrees
i
believe
however
that
the
estimation
of
very
common
temperatures
must
be
accepted
as
correct
anybody
accustomed
to
have
his
room
in
winter
degrees
will
immediately
notice
and
correctly
estimate
the
rise
or
fall
of
one
degree
again
anybody
who
takes
cold
baths
in
summer
will
observe
a
change
of
one
degree
in
temperature
it
will
therefore
be
possible
to
believe
the
pronouncements
of
witnesses
concerning
a
narrow
range
of
temperatures
but
all
the
conditions
of
perception
must
be
noted
for
the
differences
are
extreme
it
has
been
shown
that
the
whole
hand
finds
water
of
degrees
warmer
than
water
of
degrees
which
is
merely
tested
with
the
finger
further
weber
points
out
we
put
two
adjacent
fingers
into
two
different
warm
fluids
the
sensations
flow
together
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
difficult
to
distinguish
differences
but
if
we
use
two
hands
in
this
test
it
is
especially
successful
when
we
change
the
hands
from
one
fluid
to
another
the
closer
the
points
on
the
skin
which
receive
contemporary
impressions
and
perhaps
the
closer
the
portions
of
the
brain
to
which
these
impressions
are
sent
the
more
easily
these
sensations
flow
together
while
again
the
further
they
are
from
one
another
the
less
frequently
does
this
in
the
practice
of
criminal
law
such
matters
will
rarely
arise
but
estimations
of
temperature
are
frequently
required
and
their
reliability
must
be
established
it
is
important
to
know
what
a
wounded
man
and
his
enemy
feel
in
the
first
instant
of
the
crime
and
in
what
degree
their
testimonies
are
reliable
first
of
all
we
have
to
thank
the
excellent
observations
of
weber
for
the
knowledge
that
we
find
it
very
difficult
to
discover
with
closed
eyes
the
angle
made
by
a
dagger
thrust
against
the
body
it
is
equally
difficult
to
determine
the
direction
from
which
a
push
or
blow
has
come
on
the
other
hand
we
can
tell
very
accurately
in
what
direction
a
handful
of
hair
is
pulled
with
regard
to
the
time
it
takes
to
feel
contact
and
pain
it
is
asserted
that
a
short
powerful
blow
on
a
corn
is
felt
immediately
but
the
pain
of
it
one
to
two
seconds
later
it
may
be
that
corns
have
an
especial
constitution
but
otherwise
the
time
assigned
before
feeling
pain
is
far
too
long
helmholtz
made
measurements
which
proved
that
the
nervous
current
moves
feet
a
second
if
then
you
prick
your
finger
you
feel
it
a
thirtieth
of
a
second
later
the
easiest
experiments
which
may
be
made
in
that
regard
are
insufficient
to
establish
anything
definite
we
can
only
say
that
the
perception
of
a
peripheral
pain
occurs
an
observable
period
after
the
shock
about
a
third
of
a
second
later
than
its
cause
the
sensation
of
a
stab
is
often
identified
as
contact
with
a
hot
object
and
it
is
further
asserted
that
the
wounded
person
feels
close
to
the
pain
which
accompanies
the
push
or
the
cut
the
cold
of
the
blade
and
its
presence
in
the
depths
of
his
body
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
learn
from
wounded
people
these
assertions
are
not
confirmed
setting
aside
individuals
who
exaggerate
intentionally
and
want
to
make
themselves
interesting
or
to
indicate
considerable
damage
all
answers
point
to
the
fact
that
stabs
shots
and
blows
are
sensed
as
pushes
in
addition
the
rising
of
the
blood
is
felt
almost
immediately
but
nothing
else
pain
comes
much
later
it
is
asserted
by
who
have
occasion
to
have
a
considerable
number
of
duels
behind
them
that
thrusts
even
when
they
are
made
with
the
sharpest
swords
are
sensed
only
as
painless
or
almost
painless
blows
or
pushes
curiously
enough
all
say
that
the
sensation
is
felt
as
if
caused
by
some
very
broad
dull
tool
a
falling
shingle
perhaps
but
not
one
has
felt
the
cold
of
the
entering
blade
soldiers
whose
shot
wounds
were
inquired
into
often
just
a
few
minutes
after
their
being
wounded
have
said
unanimously
that
they
had
felt
only
a
hard
push
it
is
quite
different
with
the
man
who
causes
the
wound
lotze
has
rightly
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
mounting
a
ladder
with
elastic
rungs
one
perceives
clearly
the
points
at
which
the
rungs
are
fastened
to
the
sides
the
points
at
which
an
elastic
trellis
is
fastened
is
felt
when
it
is
shaken
and
the
resistance
of
the
wood
when
an
axe
is
used
on
it
in
the
same
way
the
soldier
senses
clearly
the
entrance
of
his
or
blade
into
the
body
of
his
enemy
the
last
fact
is
confirmed
by
the
students
one
can
clearly
distinguish
whether
the
sword
has
merely
beaten
through
the
skin
or
has
sunk
deeply
and
reached
the
bone
and
this
sensation
of
touch
is
concentrated
in
the
thumb
which
is
barely
under
the
hilt
of
the
sword
at
the
point
where
the
grip
rests
the
importance
of
the
fact
that
the
wounder
feels
his
success
lies
in
the
possibility
it
gives
him
when
he
wants
to
tell
the
truth
to
indicate
reliably
whether
and
how
far
he
has
wounded
his
opponent
the
importance
of
the
testimony
of
the
wounded
man
lies
in
its
influence
on
determining
in
cases
where
there
were
more
than
one
concerned
in
the
assault
which
wound
is
to
be
assigned
to
which
man
we
often
hear
from
the
victim
who
really
desires
to
tell
the
truth
was
quite
convinced
that
x
dealt
me
the
deep
stab
in
the
shoulder
but
he
has
only
pushed
and
not
stabbed
me
i
did
not
perceive
a
just
the
same
it
was
x
who
stabbed
him
and
if
the
examining
judge
explains
the
matter
to
the
victim
his
testimony
will
be
yet
more
honest
there
are
still
a
few
other
significant
facts
it
is
well
known
that
the
portion
of
the
skin
which
covers
a
bone
and
which
is
then
so
pulled
away
that
it
covers
a
fleshy
part
can
not
easily
identify
the
point
of
stimulation
such
transpositions
may
be
made
intentionally
in
this
experiment
but
they
occur
frequently
through
vigorous
twists
of
the
body
when
the
upper
part
of
the
body
is
drawn
backwards
while
one
is
sitting
down
a
collection
of
such
transpositions
occur
and
it
is
very
hard
then
to
localize
a
blow
or
stab
so
too
when
an
arm
is
held
backward
in
such
a
way
as
to
turn
the
flat
of
the
hand
uppermost
it
is
still
more
difficult
to
locate
a
wound
when
one
part
of
the
body
is
held
by
another
person
and
the
skin
pulled
aside
the
sensation
of
wetness
is
composed
of
that
of
cold
and
easy
movement
over
surface
hence
when
we
touch
without
warning
a
cold
smooth
piece
of
metal
we
think
that
we
are
touching
something
wet
but
the
converse
is
true
for
we
believe
that
we
are
touching
something
cold
and
smooth
when
it
is
only
wet
hence
the
numerous
mistakes
about
bleeding
after
wounds
the
wounded
man
or
his
companions
believe
that
they
have
felt
blood
when
they
have
only
felt
some
smooth
metal
or
they
have
really
felt
blood
and
have
taken
it
for
something
smooth
and
cold
mistakes
about
whether
there
was
blood
or
not
have
led
to
frequent
confusion
repetition
and
hence
summation
intensifies
and
clarifies
the
sensation
of
touch
as
a
consequence
whenever
we
want
to
test
anything
by
touching
it
we
do
so
repeatedly
drawing
the
finger
up
and
down
and
holding
the
object
between
the
fingers
for
the
same
reason
we
repeatedly
feel
objects
with
pleasant
exteriors
we
like
to
move
our
hands
up
and
down
smooth
or
soft
furry
surfaces
in
order
to
sense
them
more
clearly
or
to
make
the
sensation
different
because
of
its
duration
and
continuance
hence
it
is
important
every
time
something
has
to
be
determined
through
touch
to
ask
whether
the
touch
occurred
once
only
or
was
repeated
the
relation
is
not
the
same
in
this
case
as
between
a
hasty
glance
and
accurate
survey
for
in
touching
essential
differences
may
appear
it
is
very
difficult
to
determine
merely
by
touch
whether
a
thing
is
straight
or
crooked
flat
convex
or
concave
weber
has
shown
that
a
glass
plate
drawn
before
the
finger
in
such
wise
as
to
be
held
weakly
at
first
then
more
powerfully
then
again
more
powerfully
seems
to
be
convex
and
when
the
reverse
is
done
concave
flatness
is
given
when
the
distance
is
kept
constant
according
to
vierordt
the
motion
of
a
point
at
a
constant
rate
over
a
sizable
piece
of
skin
the
back
of
the
hand
from
the
wrist
to
the
finger
tips
gives
if
not
looked
at
the
definite
impression
of
increasing
rapidity
in
the
opposite
direction
the
definiteness
is
less
but
increases
with
the
extent
of
skin
covered
this
indicates
that
mistakes
may
be
made
in
such
wounds
as
cuts
scratches
etc
the
problem
may
arise
of
the
reliability
of
impressions
of
habitual
pressure
weber
made
the
earliest
experiments
later
verified
by
fechner
showing
that
the
sensation
of
weight
differs
a
great
deal
on
different
portions
of
the
skin
the
most
sensitive
are
the
forehead
the
temples
the
eyelids
the
inside
of
the
forearm
the
most
insensitive
are
the
lips
the
trunk
and
the
if
piles
of
six
silver
dollars
are
laid
on
various
parts
of
the
body
and
then
removed
one
at
a
time
the
differences
are
variously
felt
in
order
to
notice
a
removal
the
following
number
must
be
taken
away
one
dollar
from
the
top
of
the
finger
one
dollar
from
the
sole
of
the
foot
two
dollars
from
the

topic
perception
and
conception
section
what
lawyers
have
to
consider
in
the
transition
from
purely
sensory
impressions
to
intellectual
conceptions
of
these
impressions
is
the
possibility
of
later
reproducing
any
observed
object
or
event
many
scientific
distinctions
have
under
the
impulse
of
scientific
psychology
lost
their
status
modern
psychology
does
not
see
boundaries
between
perception
and
memory
and
suggests
that
the
proper
solution
of
the
problem
of
perception
is
the
solution
of
the
problem
of
knowledge
with
regard
to
the
relation
of
consciousness
to
perception
we
will
make
the
distinctions
made
by
fischer
there
are
two
spheres
or
regions
of
consciousness
the
region
of
sensation
and
of
external
perception
the
former
involves
the
inner
structure
of
the
organism
the
latter
passes
from
the
organism
into
the
objective
world
consciousness
has
a
sphere
of
action
in
which
it
deals
with
the
external
world
by
means
of
the
motor
nerves
and
muscles
and
a
sphere
of
perception
which
is
the
business
of
the
senses
external
perception
involves
three
principal
functions
apprehension
differentiation
and
combination
perception
in
the
narrower
sense
of
the
term
is
the
simple
sensory
conscious
apprehension
of
some
present
object
stimulating
our
eyes
we
discover
by
means
of
it
what
the
object
is
its
relation
to
ourselves
and
other
things
its
distance
from
us
its
name
etc
what
succeeds
this
apprehension
is
the
most
important
thing
for
us
lawyers
recognition
indicates
only
that
an
object
has
sufficiently
impressed
a
mind
to
keep
it
known
and
identifiable
it
is
indifferent
what
the
nature
of
the
recognized
object
is
according
to
hume
the
object
may
be
an
enduring
thing
and
on
or
it
may
be
identical
with
perception
itself
in
the
latter
case
the
perception
is
considered
as
a
logical
judgment
like
the
judgment
is
raining
or
the
feeling
that
is
raining
and
there
recognition
is
only
the
recognition
of
a
perception
now
judgments
of
this
sort
are
what
we
get
from
witnesses
and
what
we
have
to
examine
and
evaluate
this
must
be
done
from
two
points
of
view
first
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
observer
and
collector
of
instances
who
is
seeking
to
discover
the
principle
which
governs
them
if
this
is
not
done
the
deductions
that
we
make
are
at
least
unreliable
and
in
most
cases
false
as
mach
says
once
observation
has
determined
all
the
facts
of
any
natural
science
a
new
period
begins
for
that
science
the
period
of
but
how
often
do
we
lawyers
distinguish
these
two
periods
in
our
own
work
the
second
point
of
importance
is
the
presence
of
mistakes
in
the
observations
the
essential
mistakes
are
classified
by
schiel
under
two
headings
mistakes
in
observation
are
positive
or
negative
wrong
observation
or
oversight
the
latter
occurs
largely
through
preconceived
opinions
the
opponents
of
copernicus
concluded
that
the
earth
did
not
move
because
otherwise
a
stone
dropped
from
the
top
of
a
tower
would
reach
the
ground
a
little
to
the
west
if
the
adherents
of
copernicus
had
made
the
experiment
they
would
have
discovered
that
the
stone
does
fall
as
the
theory
requires
similar
oversights
occur
in
the
work
hundreds
of
times
we
are
impressed
with
exceptions
that
are
made
by
others
or
by
ourselves
and
give
up
some
already
tried
approach
without
actually
testing
the
truth
of
the
exception
which
challenges
it
i
have
frequently
while
at
work
thought
of
the
story
of
some
one
of
the
georges
who
did
not
like
scholars
and
set
the
following
problem
to
a
number
of
philosophers
and
physicists
i
put
a
ten
pound
stone
into
a
hundred
pound
barrel
of
water
the
whole
weighs
a
hundred
and
ten
pounds
but
when
i
put
a
live
fish
of
ten
pounds
into
the
barrel
the
whole
still
weighs
only
a
hundred
pounds
each
one
of
the
scholars
had
his
own
convincing
explanation
until
finally
the
king
asked
one
of
the
who
said
that
he
would
like
to
see
the
experiment
tried
before
he
made
up
his
mind
i
remember
a
case
in
which
a
peasant
was
accused
of
having
committed
arson
for
the
sake
of
the
insurance
he
asserted
that
he
had
gone
into
a
room
with
a
candle
and
that
a
long
web
which
was
hanging
down
had
caught
fire
from
it
accidentally
and
had
inflamed
the
straw
which
hung
from
the
roof
so
the
catastrophe
had
occurred
only
in
the
second
examination
did
it
occur
to
anybody
to
ask
whether
web
can
burn
at
all
and
the
first
experiment
showed
that
that
was
impossible
most
experiences
of
this
kind
indicate
that
in
recognizing
events
we
must
proceed
slowly
without
leaping
and
that
we
may
construct
our
notions
only
on
the
basis
of
knowledge
we
already
possess
saint
thomas
says
cognitio
fit
secundum
similitudinem
cogniti
in
if
this
bit
of
wisdom
were
kept
in
mind
in
the
examination
of
witnesses
it
would
be
an
easier
and
simpler
task
than
usual
only
when
the
unknown
is
connected
with
the
known
is
it
possible
to
understand
the
former
if
it
is
not
done
the
witness
will
hardly
be
able
to
answer
he
nowhere
finds
support
or
he
seeks
one
of
his
own
and
naturally
finds
the
wrong
one
so
the
information
that
an
ordinary
traveler
brings
home
is
mainly
identical
with
what
he
carries
away
for
he
has
ears
and
eyes
only
for
what
he
expects
to
see
for
how
long
a
time
did
the
negro
believe
that
disease
pales
the
coral
that
he
wears
yet
if
he
had
only
watched
it
he
would
have
seen
how
foolish
the
notion
was
how
long
since
adam
smith
did
people
believe
that
extravagance
helps
industry
and
how
much
longer
have
people
called
copernicus
a
fool
because
they
actually
saw
the
sun
rise
and
set
so
mill
puts
his
opinions
on
this
matter
benneke
adds
anybody
describes
to
me
an
animal
a
region
a
work
of
art
or
narrates
an
event
i
get
no
notion
through
the
words
i
hear
of
the
appearance
of
the
subject
i
merely
have
a
problem
set
me
by
means
of
the
words
and
signs
in
the
conception
of
the
subject
and
hence
it
depends
for
truth
mainly
upon
the
completeness
of
earlier
conceptions
of
similar
things
or
events
and
upon
the
material
i
have
imaginatively
at
hand
these
are
my
perceptual
capital
and
my
power
of
it
naturally
is
not
necessary
to
ask
whether
a
narrator
has
ever
seen
the
things
he
speaks
of
nor
to
convince
oneself
in
examination
that
the
person
in
question
knows
accurately
what
he
is
talking
about
at
the
same
time
the
examiner
ought
to
be
clear
on
the
matter
and
know
what
attitude
to
take
if
he
is
going
to
deal
intelligibly
with
the
other
i
might
say
that
all
of
us
educated
and
uneducated
have
apprehended
and
remember
definite
and
distinct
images
of
all
things
we
have
seen
heard
or
learned
from
descriptions
when
we
get
new
information
we
simply
attach
the
new
image
to
the
old
or
extinguish
a
part
of
the
old
and
put
the
new
in
its
place
or
we
retain
only
a
more
or
less
vigorous
breath
of
the
old
with
the
new
such
images
go
far
back
even
animals
possess
them
one
day
my
small
son
came
with
his
exciting
information
that
his
guinea
pig
well
known
as
a
stupid
beast
could
count
he
tried
to
prove
this
by
removing
the
six
young
from
their
mother
and
hiding
them
so
that
she
could
not
see
what
happened
to
them
then
he
took
one
of
the
six
hid
it
and
brought
the
remaining
five
back
to
the
old
lady
she
smelled
them
one
after
the
other
and
then
showed
a
good
deal
of
excitement
as
if
she
missed
something
then
she
was
again
removed
and
the
sixth
pig
brought
back
when
she
was
restored
to
her
brood
she
sniffed
all
six
and
showed
a
great
deal
of
satisfaction
could
count
at
least
naturally
the
beast
had
only
a
fixed
collective
image
of
her
brood
and
as
one
was
missing
the
image
was
disturbed
and
incorrect
at
the
same
time
the
image
was
such
as
is
created
by
the
combination
of
events
or
circumstances
it
is
not
far
from
the
images
of
humanity
and
differs
only
in
degree
from
those
of
civilized
people
the
fact
that
a
good
deal
of
what
is
said
is
incorrect
and
yet
not
consciously
untrue
depends
upon
the
existence
of
these
images
and
their
association
with
the
new
material
the
speaker
and
the
auditor
have
different
sets
of
images
the
first
relates
the
new
material
differently
from
a
second
and
so
of
course
they
can
not
agree
it
is
the
difficult
task
of
the
examiner
so
to
adapt
what
is
said
as
to
make
it
appropriate
to
the
right
images
without
making
it
possible
for
incorrect
interpretations
to
enter
when
we
have
a
as
witness
concerning
some
unspeakable
deal
a
concerning
some
brawling
in
a
peasant
saloon
a
clubman
concerning
a
duel
a
concerning
poaching
the
set
of
images
of
each
one
of
these
persons
will
be
a
bad
foundation
for
new
perceptions
on
the
other
hand
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
abstract
from
them
correctly
but
cases
of
this
sort
are
not
of
constant
occurrence
and
the
great
trouble
consists
in
once
for
all
discovering
what
were
present
before
the
witness
perceived
the
event
in
question
the
former
have
a
great
influence
upon
the
perception
of
the
latter
in
this
connection
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that
the
retention
of
these
images
is
somewhat
pedantic
and
depends
upon
unimportant
things
in
the
city
hall
of
graz
there
is
a
secretary
with
sections
for
the
different
papers
the
name
of
the
appropriate
journal
was
written
clearly
over
each
section
and
in
spite
of
the
clearness
of
the
script
the
depositing
and
removing
of
the
papers
required
certain
effort
inasmuch
as
the
script
had
to
be
read
and
could
not
be
apprehended
later
the
name
of
the
paper
was
cut
out
of
each
and
pasted
on
the
secretary
instead
of
the
script
and
then
in
spite
of
the
various
curly
and
twisted
letters
the
habitual
images
of
the
titles
were
easily
apprehended
and
their
removal
and
return
became
mechanical
the
customary
and
identical
things
are
so
habitual
that
they
are
apprehended
with
greater
ease
than
more
distinct
objects
inasmuch
as
we
can
conceive
only
on
the
basis
of
the
constancy
and
similarity
of
forms
we
make
these
forms
the
essence
of
experience
on
the
other
hand
what
is
constant
and
similar
for
one
individual
is
not
so
for
another
and
essences
of
experience
vary
with
the
experiencer
we
behold
a
die
of
which
we
can
see
three
sides
at
a
time
seven
corners
and
nine
edges
we
immediately
induce
the
image
or
schema
of
a
die
and
we
make
our
further
accord
with
this
schema
in
this
way
we
get
a
series
of
schemas
which
we
may
substitute
for
one
aubert
for
the
same
reason
we
associate
in
description
things
unknown
to
the
auditor
which
we
presuppose
in
him
and
hence
we
can
make
him
rightly
understand
only
if
we
have
named
some
appropriate
object
in
comparison
conversely
we
have
to
remember
that
everybody
takes
his
comparison
from
his
own
experience
so
that
we
must
have
had
a
like
experience
if
we
are
to
know
what
is
compared
it
is
disastrous
to
neglect
the
private
nature
of
this
experience
whoever
has
much
to
do
with
peasants
who
like
to
make
use
of
powerful
comparisons
must
first
comprehend
their
essential
life
if
he
is
to
understand
how
to
reduce
their
comparisons
to
correct
meanings
and
if
he
has
done
so
he
will
find
such
comparisons
and
images
the
most
distinct
and
the
most
intelligible
has
a
great
deal
to
do
in
apprehension
and
no
one
can
determine
the
boundary
where
the
sense
activity
ends
and
the
intellectual
begins
i
do
not
recall
who
has
made
note
of
the
interesting
fact
that
not
one
of
twenty
students
in
an
egyptian
museum
knew
why
the
hands
of
the
figures
of
egyptian
wall
pictures
gave
the
impression
of
being
incorrect
nobody
had
observed
the
fact
that
all
the
figures
had
two
right
hands
i
once
paid
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
tricks
and
as
i
acquired
them
either
of
myself
or
from
practised
gamblers
i
demonstrated
them
to
the
young
criminalists
for
a
long
time
i
refused
to
believe
what
an
old
greek
told
me
more
foolish
and
obvious
a
trick
is
the
more
certain
it
is
people
never
see
the
man
was
right
when
i
told
my
pupils
expressly
i
am
cheating
i
was
able
to
make
with
safety
a
false
coup
a
false
deal
etc
nobody
saw
it
if
only
one
has
half
a
notion
of
directing
the
eyes
to
some
other
thing
a
card
may
be
laid
on
the
lap
thrust
into
the
sleeve
taken
from
the
pocket
and
god
knows
what
else
now
who
can
say
in
such
a
case
whether
the
sensory
glance
or
the
intellectual
apprehension
was
unskilful
or
unpractised
according
to
some
authorities
the
chief
source
of
error
is
the
senses
but
whether
something
must
not
be
attributed
to
that
mysterious
inexplicable
moment
in
which
sensory
perception
becomes
intellectual
perception
nobody
can
say
my
favorite
demonstration
of
how
surprisingly
little
people
perceive
is
quite
simple
i
set
a
tray
with
a
bottle
of
water
and
several
glasses
on
the
table
call
express
attention
to
what
is
about
to
occur
and
pour
a
little
water
from
the
bottle
into
the
glass
then
the
stuff
is
taken
away
and
the
astonishing
question
asked
what
have
i
done
all
the
spectators
reply
immediately
you
have
poured
water
into
a
glass
then
i
ask
further
with
what
hand
did
i
do
it
how
many
glasses
were
there
where
was
the
glass
into
which
i
poured
the
water
how
much
did
i
pour
how
much
water
was
there
in
the
glass
did
i
really
pour
or
just
pretend
to
how
full
was
the
bottle
was
it
certainly
water
and
not
perhaps
wine
was
it
not
red
wine
what
did
i
do
with
my
hand
after
pouring
the
water
how
did
i
look
when
i
did
it
did
you
not
really
see
that
i
shut
my
eyes
did
you
not
really
see
that
i
stuck
my
tongue
out
was
i
pouring
the
water
while
i
did
it
or
before
or
after
did
i
wear
a
ring
on
my
hand
was
my
cuff
visible
what
was
the
position
of
my
fingers
while
i
held
the
glass
these
questions
may
be
multiplied
and
it
is
as
astonishing
as
amusing
to
see
how
little
correctness
there
is
in
the
answers
and
how
people
quarrel
about
the
answers
and
what
extraordinary
things
they
say
yet
what
do
we
require
of
witnesses
who
have
to
describe
much
more
complicated
matters
to
which
their
attention
had
not
been
previously
called
and
who
have
to
make
their
answers
not
immediately
but
much
later
and
who
moreover
may
in
the
presence
of
the
fact
have
been
overcome
by
fear
astonishment
terror
i
find
that
probing
even
comparatively
trained
witnesses
is
rather
too
funny
and
the
conclusions
drawn
from
what
is
so
learned
are
rather
too
conscienceless
such
introductions
as
you
will
know
recall
this
one
be
so
stupid
as
not
to
have
observed
whether
my
dear
woman
you
have
eyes
and
whatever
else
may
be
offered
in
this
kindly
fashion
may
bring
out
an
answer
but
what
real
worth
can
such
an
answer
have
one
bright
day
i
came
home
from
court
and
saw
a
man
step
out
of
a
cornfield
remain
a
few
instants
in
my
field
of
vision
and
then
disappear
i
felt
at
once
that
the
man
had
done
something
suspicious
and
immediately
asked
myself
how
he
looked
i
found
i
knew
nothing
of
his
clothes
his
dress
his
beard
his
size
in
a
word
nothing
at
all
about
him
but
how
i
would
have
punished
a
witness
who
should
have
known
just
as
little
we
shall
have
in
the
course
of
this
examination
frequently
to
mention
the
fact
that
we
do
not
see
an
event
in
spite
of
its
being
in
the
field
of
perception
i
want
at
this
point
merely
to
call
attention
to
a
single
case
recorded
by
hofmann
at
a
trial
a
circumstantial
and
accurate
attempt
was
made
to
discover
whether
it
was
a
significant
alteration
to
bite
a
ear
off
the
court
the
physician
the
witnesses
dealt
with
the
question
of
altering
until
finally
the
wounded
man
himself
showed
what
was
meant
because
his
other
ear
had
been
bitten
off
many
years
before
but
then
nobody
had
noticed
that
mutilated
ear
in
order
to
know
what
another
person
has
seen
and
apprehended
we
must
first
of
all
know
how
he
thinks
and
that
is
impossible
we
frequently
say
of
another
that
he
must
have
thought
this
or
that
or
have
hit
upon
such
and
such
ideas
but
what
the
events
in
another
brain
may
be
we
can
never
observe
as
says
somewhere
ghost
could
build
a
homunculus
according
to
the
leibnitzian
theory
atom
by
atom
and
molecule
by
molecule
he
might
succeed
in
making
it
think
but
not
in
knowing
how
it
but
if
we
know
at
least
approximately
the
kind
of
mental
process
of
a
person
who
is
as
close
as
possible
to
us
in
sex
age
culture
position
experience
we
lose
this
knowledge
with
every
step
that
leads
to
differences
we
know
well
what
great
influence
is
exercised
by
the
multiplicity
of
talents
superpositions
knowledge
and
apprehensions
when
we
consider
the
qualities
of
things
we
discover
that
we
never
apprehend
them
abstractly
but
always
concretely
we
do
not
see
color
but
the
colored
object
we
do
not
see
warmth
but
something
warm
not
hardness
but
something
hard
the
concept
warm
as
such
can
not
be
thought
of
by
anybody
and
at
the
mention
of
the
word
each
will
think
of
some
particular
warm
object
one
of
his
oven
at
home
another
of
a
warm
day
in
italy
another
of
a
piece
of
hot
iron
which
burnt
him
once
then
the
individual
does
not
pay
constant
court
to
the
same
object
he
has
in
mind
this
concrete
thing
he
uses
different
names
and
makes
different
associations
but
every
concrete
object
i
think
of
has
considerable
effect
on
the
new
apprehension
and
my
auditor
does
not
know
perhaps
even
i
myself
do
not
what
concrete
object
i
have
already
in
mind
and
although
berkeley
has
already
shown
that
color
can
not
be
thought
of
without
space
or
space
without
color
the
task
of
determining
the
concrete
object
to
which
the
witness
attaches
the
qualities
he
speaks
of
will
still
be
overlooked
hundreds
of
times
it
is
further
of
importance
that
everybody
has
learned
to
know
the
object
he
speaks
about
through
repetition
that
different
relations
have
shown
him
the
matter
in
different
ways
if
an
object
has
impressed
itself
upon
us
once
pleasurably
and
once
unpleasantly
we
can
not
derive
the
history
and
character
of
the
present
impression
from
the
object
alone
nor
can
we
find
it
merely
in
the
synthetic
memory
sensations
which
are
due
to
the
traces
of
the
former
coalescing
impressions
we
are
frequently
unable
because
of
this
coalescing
of
earlier
impressions
to
keep
them
apart
and
to
study
their
effect
on
present
impressions
frequently
we
do
not
even
at
all
know
why
this
or
that
impression
is
so
vivid
but
if
we
are
ignorant
with
regard
to
what
occurs
in
ourselves
how
much
can
we
know
about
others
exner
calls
attention
to
the
fact
that
it
is
in
this
direction
especially
that
the
play
a
great
r√¥le
great
part
of
our
intelligence
depends
on
the
ability
of
these
to
rise
without
requiring
further
attention
into
the
field
of
consciousness
there
are
people
who
recognize
birds
in
their
flight
without
knowing
clearly
what
the
characteristic
flight
for
any
definite
bird
may
be
others
still
more
intelligent
know
at
what
intervals
the
flyers
beat
their
wings
for
they
can
imitate
them
with
their
hands
and
when
the
intelligence
is
still
greater
it
makes
possible
a
correct
description
in
suppose
that
in
some
important
criminal
case
several
people
of
different
degrees
of
education
and
intelligence
have
made
observations
we
suppose
that
they
all
want
to
tell
the
truth
and
we
also
suppose
that
they
have
observed
and
apprehended
their
objects
correctly
their
testimonies
nevertheless
will
be
very
different
with
the
degree
of
intelligence
rises
the
degree
of
effect
of
the
subconscious
they
give
more
definite
presentation
and
explanation
of
the
testimony
they
turn
bare
assertions
into
perceptions
and
real
representations
but
we
generally
make
the
mistake
of
ascribing
the
variety
of
evidence
to
varying
views
or
to
dishonesty
to
establish
the
unanimity
of
such
various
data
or
to
find
out
whether
they
have
such
unanimity
is
not
easy
the
most
comfortable
procedure
is
to
compare
the
lesser
testimonies
with
those
of
the
most
intelligent
of
the
witnesses
as
a
rule
anybody
who
has
a
subconscious
perception
of
the
object
will
be
glad
to
bring
it
out
if
he
is
helped
by
some
form
of
expression
but
the
danger
of
suggestion
is
here
so
great
that
this
assistance
must
be
given
only
in
the
rarest
of
cases
the
best
thing
is
to
help
the
witness
to
his
full
evidence
gradually
at
the
same
time
taking
care
not
to
suggest
oneself
and
thus
to
cause
agreement
of
several
testimonies
which
were
really
different
but
only
appeared
to
look
contradictory
on
account
of
the
effect
of
subconscious
perceptions
the
very
best
thing
is
to
take
the
testimony
as
it
comes
without
alteration
and
later
on
when
there
is
a
great
deal
of
material
and
the
matter
has
grown
clearer
to
test
the
stuff
carefully
and
to
see
whether
the
less
intelligent
persons
gave
different
testimonies
through
lack
of
capacity
in
expression
or
because
they
really
had
perceived
different
things
and
had
different
things
to
say
this
is
important
when
the
witnesses
examined
are
experts
in
the
matter
in
which
they
are
examined
i
am
convinced
that
the
belief
that
such
people
must
be
the
best
witnesses
is
false
at
least
as
a
generalization

has
also
made
similar
observations
chemist
who
perceives
a
chemical
process
the
connoisseur
a
picture
the
musician
a
symphony
perceive
them
with
more
vigorous
attention
than
the
layman
but
the
actual
attention
may
be
greater
with
the
for
our
own
affair
it
is
enough
to
know
that
the
judgment
of
the
expert
will
naturally
be
better
than
that
of
the
layman
his
apprehension
however
is
as
a
rule
not
so
and
less
uncolored
it
is
natural
that
every
expert
especially
when
he
takes
his
work
seriously
should
find
most
interest
in
that
side
of
an
event
with
which
his
profession
deals
oversight
of
legally
important
matters
is
therefore
almost
inevitable
i
remember
how
an
eager
young
doctor
was
once
witness
of
an
assault
with
intent
to
kill
he
had
seen
how
in
an
inn
the
criminal
had
for
some
time
threatened
his
victim
with
a
heavy
porcelain
os
parietale
may
here
be
broken
the
doctor
thought
and
while
he
was
thinking
of
the
surgical
consequences
of
such
a
blow
the
thing
was
done
and
the
doctor
had
not
seen
how
the
blow
was
delivered
whether
a
knife
had
been
drawn
by
the
victim
etc
similarly
during
an
examination
concerning
breaking
open
the
drawer
of
a
table
the
worst
witness
was
the
the
latter
was
so
much
interested
in
the
foreign
manner
in
which
the
portions
of
the
drawer
had
been
cemented
and
in
the
curious
wood
that
he
had
nothing
to
say
about
the
legally
important
question
of
how
the
break
was
made
what
the
impression
of
the
damaging
tool
was
etc
most
of
us
have
had
such
experiences
with
expert
witnesses
and
most
of
us
have
also
observed
that
they
often
give
false
evidence
because
they
treat
the
event
in
terms
of
their
own
interest
and
are
convinced
that
things
must
happen
according
to
the
principles
of
their
trades
however
the
event
shapes
itself
they
model
it
and
alter
it
so
much
that
it
finally
implies
their
own
apprehension
perceptions
somewhat
altered
play
another
r√¥le
according
to
exner
in
orientation
if
anybody
is
able
to
orient
himself
know
where
he
is
at
any
time
and
keep
in
mind
the
general
direction
it
is
important
to
be
aware
of
the
fact
when
he
serves
as
witness
for
his
information
will
in
consequence
take
a
different
form
and
assume
a
different
value
exner
says
of
himself
that
he
knows
at
each
moment
of
his
climb
of
the
tower
in
what
direction
he
goes
as
for
me
once
i
have
turned
around
i
am
lost
our
perceptions
of
location
and
their
value
would
be
very
different
if
we
had
to
testify
concerning
relations
of
places
in
court
but
hardly
anybody
will
assure
the
court
that
in
general
he
orients
himself
well
or
as
exner
says
when
walking
i
suddenly
stop
in
front
of
a
house
to
look
at
it
i
am
definitely
in
possession
also
of
the
feeling
of
its
distance
from
where
i
left
the
road
the
unconscious
perception
of
the
road
beyond
is
here
at
it
might
indeed
be
compared
with
pure
subconsciousness
in
which
series
of
processes
occur
without
our
knowing
it
but
local
orientation
does
not
end
with
the
feeling
for
place
it
is
at
work
even
in
the
cases
of
small
memories
of
location
in
learning
things
by
heart
in
knowing
on
what
page
and
on
what
line
anything
is
printed
in
finding
unobserved
things
etc
these
questions
of
are
important
for
there
are
people
all
of
whose
perceptions
are
closely
related
to
their
sense
of
location
much
may
be
learned
from
such
people
by
use
of
this
specialty
of
theirs
while
oversight
thereof
may
render
them
hopeless
as
witnesses
how
far
this
goes
with
some
people
as
a
rule
people
with
a
sense
of
location
are
the
more
intelligent
i
saw
some
time
ago
when
the
germanist
bernhardt
seuffert
told
me
that
when
he
did
not
know
how
anything
is
spelled
he
imagined
its
appearance
and
when
that
did
not
help
he
wrote
both
the
forms
between
which
he
was
vacillating
and
then
knew
which
one
was
the
correct
one
when
i
asked
him
whether
the
chirographic
image
appeared
printed
or
written
and
in
what
type
he
replied
significantly
enough
my
wrote
he
definitely
localized
the
image
on
his
writing
book
of
many
years
ago
and
read
it
off
in
his
mind
such
specialties
must
be
remembered
in
examining
witnesses
in
conclusion
there
is
a
word
to
say
concerning
investigations
of
the
time
required
for
apprehension
the
better
a
man
knows
the
language
the
more
rapidly
can
he
repeat
and
read
its
words
it
is
for
this
reason
that
we
believe
that
foreigners
speak
more
rapidly
than
we
cattell
finds
this
so
indubitable
that
he
wants
to
use
speed
as
a
test
in
the
examinations
in
foreign
languages
the
time
used
in
order
to
identify
a
single
letter
is
a
quarter
of
a
second
the
time
to
pronounce
it
of
a
second
colors
and
pictures
require
noticeably
more
not
because
they
are
not
recognized
but
because
it
is
necessary
to
think
what
the
right
name
is
we
are
much
more
accustomed
to
reading
words
these
observations
might
be
carried
a
step
further
the
more
definitely
an
event
to
be
described
is
conceived
the
clearer
the
deduction
and
the
more
certain
the
memory
of
it
the
more
rapidly
may
it
be
reproduced
it
follows
that
setting
aside
individual
idiosyncrasies
the
rapidity
of
speech
of
a
witness
will
be
of
importance
when
we
want
to
know
how
much
he
has
thought
on
a
question
and
is
certain
what
he
is
going
to
say
it
is
conceivable
that
a
person
who
is
trying
to
remember
the
event
accurately
will
speak
slowly
and
stutteringly
or
at
least
with
hesitation
at
the
moment
the
same
will
occur
if
he
tries
to
conceive
of
various
possibilities
to
eliminate
some
and
to
avoid
contradiction
and
improbability
if
however
the
witness
is
convinced
and
believes
truly
what
he
is
telling
so
that
he
may
go
over
it
in
his
mind
easily
and
without
interruption
he
will
tell
his
story
as
quickly
as
he
can
this
may
indeed
be
observed
in
public
speakers
even
judges
prosecutors
and
defense
if
anyone
of
them
is
not
clear
with
regard
to
the
case
he
represents
or
not
convinced
of
its
correctness
he
will
speak
slowly
if
the
situation
is
reversed
he
will
speak
rapidly
court
and
other
public
stenographers
confirm
this
observation
topic
imagination
section
the
things
witnesses
tell
us
have
formerly
existed
in
their
imaginations
and
the
of
this
existence
determines
in
a
large
degree
the
of
what
they
offer
us
hence
the
nature
of
imagination
must
be
of
interest
to
us
and
the
more
so
as
we
need
not
concern
ourselves
with
the
relation
between
being
and
imagination
it
may
be
that
things
may
exist
in
forms
quite
different
from
those
in
which
we
know
them
perhaps
even
in
unknowable
forms
the
idealist
according
to
some
authorities
has
set
this
possibility
aside
and
given
a
scientific
reply
to
those
who
raised
it
so
far
as
we
lawyers
are
concerned
the
does
not
matter
we
are
interested
in
the
reliability
of
the
imagination
and
in
its
identification
with
what
we
assume
to
exist
and
to
occur
some
writers
hold
that
sensory
objects
are
in
both
external
and
internal
external
with
regard
to
each
other
and
internal
with
regard
to
consciousness
attention
is
called
to
the
fact
that
the
distinction
between
image
and
object
constitutes
no
part
of
the
act
of
perception
but
those
who
remark
this
fact
assume
that
the
act
does
contain
an
image
according
to
augustine
the
image
serves
as
the
knowledge
of
the
object
according
to
erdmann
the
object
is
the
image
objectified
of
great
importance
is
the
substitutional
adequacy
of
images
i
imagine
my
absent
dog
dog
whom
i
know
only
pictorially
and
finally
the
dog
of
alcibiades
whose
appearance
is
known
only
by
the
fact
that
he
was
pretty
and
that
his
master
had
cut
off
his
tail
in
this
case
the
representative
value
of
these
images
will
be
definite
for
everybody
knows
that
i
can
imagine
my
own
dog
very
correctly
that
the
image
of
beast
will
also
be
comparatively
good
inasmuch
as
this
animal
has
been
frequently
pictured
and
described
while
the
image
of
dog
will
want
much
in
the
way
of
reliability
although
i
have
imagined
this
historic
animal
quite
vividly
since
boyhood
when
therefore
i
speak
of
any
one
of
these
three
animals
everybody
will
be
able
properly
to
value
the
correctness
of
my
images
because
he
knows
their
conditions
when
we
speak
with
a
witness
however
we
rarely
know
the
conditions
under
which
he
has
obtained
his
images
and
we
learn
them
only
from
him
now
it
happens
that
the
description
offered
by
the
witness
adds
another
image
our
own
image
of
the
matter
and
this
and
that
of
the
witness
have
to
be
placed
in
specific
relation
to
each
other
out
of
the
individual
images
of
all
concerned
an
image
should
be
provided
which
implies
the
image
of
the
represented
event
images
can
be
compared
only
with
images
or
images
are
only
pictures
of
images
the
difficulty
of
this
transmutation
lies
fundamentally
in
the
nature
of
representation
representation
can
never
be
identical
with
its
object
helmholtz
has
made
this
most
clear
visions
and
representations
are
effects
objects
seen
and
represented
have
worked
on
our
nervous
system
and
on
our
consciousness
the
nature
of
each
effect
depends
necessarily
upon
the
nature
of
its
cause
and
the
nature
of
the
individual
upon
whom
the
cause
was
at
work
to
demand
an
image
which
should
absolutely
reproduce
its
object
and
therefore
be
absolutely
true
would
be
to
demand
an
effect
which
should
be
absolutely
independent
of
the
nature
of
that
object
on
which
the
effect
is
caused
and
this
is
an
obvious
what
the
difference
between
image
and
object
consists
of
whether
it
is
merely
formal
or
material
how
much
it
matters
has
not
yet
been
scientifically
proved
and
may
never
be
so
we
have
to
assume
only
that
the
validity
of
this
distinction
is
universally
known
and
that
everybody
possesses
an
innate
corrective
with
which
he
assigns
proper
place
to
image
and
object
he
knows
approximately
the
distinction
between
them
the
difficulty
lies
in
the
fact
that
not
all
people
possess
an
identical
standard
and
that
upon
the
creation
of
the
latter
practically
all
human
qualities
exert
an
influence
this
variety
in
standards
again
is
on
the
one
side
it
depends
on
the
essence
of
image
and
of
object
on
the
other
it
depends
on
the
alteration
which
the
image
undergoes
even
during
perception
as
well
as
during
all
the
ensuing
time
everybody
knows
this
distinction
whoever
has
seen
anything
under
certain
circumstances
or
during
a
certain
period
of
his
life
may
frequently
produce
an
image
of
it
varying
in
individual
characteristics
but
in
its
general
character
constant
if
he
sees
it
later
under
different
conditions
at
a
different
age
when
memory
and
imaginative
disposition
have
exercised
their
alterative
influence
image
and
object
fail
to
correspond
in
various
directions
the
matter
is
still
worse
with
regard
to
images
of
things
and
events
that
have
never
been
seen
i
can
imagine
the
siege
of
troy
a
dragon
the
polar
night
and
alexander
the
great
but
how
different
will
the
image
be
from
the
object
this
is
especially
obvious
when
we
have
perceived
something
which
did
not
appear
to
us
altogether
correct
we
improve
the
thing
we
study
how
it
might
have
been
better
and
we
remember
it
as
improved
then
the
more
frequently
this
object
as
imagined
recurs
the
more
fixed
its
form
becomes
but
not
its
actual
form
only
its
altered
form
we
see
this
with
especial
clearness
in
the
case
of
drawings
that
in
some
way
displease
us
suppose
i
do
not
like
the
red
dress
of
a
woman
in
some
picture
and
i
prefer
brown
if
later
i
recall
the
picture
the
image
will
become
progressively
browner
and
browner
and
finally
i
see
the
picture
as
brown
and
when
i
meet
the
real
object
i
wonder
about
the
red
dress
we
get
this
situation
in
miniature
each
time
we
hear
of
a
crime
however
barren
the
news
may
be
no
more
than
a
telegraphic
word
the
event
must
naturally
have
some
degree
of
importance
because
if
i
hear
merely
that
a
silver
watch
has
been
stolen
i
do
not
try
to
imagine
that
situation
if
however
i
hear
that
near
a
hostelry
in
x
a
peasant
was
robbed
by
two
traveling
apprentices
i
immediately
get
an
image
which
contains
not
only
the
unknown
region
but
also
the
event
of
the
robbery
and
even
perhaps
the
faces
of
those
concerned
it
does
not
much
matter
that
this
image
is
completely
false
in
practically
every
detail
because
in
the
greater
number
of
cases
it
is
corrected
the
real
danger
lies
in
the
fact
that
this
correction
is
frequently
so
bad
and
often
fails
altogether
and
that
in
consequence
the
first
image
again
breaks
through
and
remains
the
most
vigorous
the
vigor
is
the
greater
because
we
always
attach
such
imagination
to
something
actual
or
approximately
real
and
inasmuch
as
the
latter
thing
is
either
really
seen
or
at
least
energetically
imagined
the
first
image
acquires
renewed
power
of
coming
up
according
to
lipps
images
presuppose
dispositions
dispositions
ensue
upon
perceptions
that
they
imply
still
there
are
reproductive
images
and
imagined
wholes
which
imply
no
preceding
perceptions
this
contradiction
is
solved
when
dispositions
are
contained
in
other
things
at
the
same
time
a
finite
number
of
dispositions
may
in
this
way
be
also
infinite
dispositions
are
transformed
power
itself
power
transformed
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
able
to
respond
actively
to
inner
the
process
is
similar
in
the
reproduction
of
images
during
speech
the
fact
that
this
reproduction
is
not
direct
but
depends
on
the
sequence
of
images
leads
to
the
garrulity
of
children
old
men
and
uneducated
people
who
try
to
present
the
whole
complex
of
relations
belonging
to
any
given
image
but
such
total
recall
drives
the
judge
to
despair
not
only
because
he
loses
time
but
because
of
the
danger
of
having
the
attention
turned
from
important
to
unimportant
things
the
same
thing
is
perceived
in
judicial
documents
which
often
reveal
the
fact
that
the
dictator
permitted
himself
to
be
led
astray
by
unskilful
witnesses
or
that
he
had
himself
been
responsible
for
abstruse
indirect
memories
the
real
thinker
will
almost
always
be
chary
of
words
because
he
retains
from
among
the
numberless
images
which
are
attached
to
his
idea
only
those
most
closely
related
to
his
immediate
purpose
hence
good
protocols
are
almost
always
comparatively
short
it
is
even
as
instructive
as
amusing
to
examine
certain
protocols
with
regard
to
what
ought
to
be
omitted
and
then
with
regard
to
the
direct
representations
to
everything
that
appertains
to
the
real
illumination
of
the
question
it
is
astounding
how
little
of
the
latter
thing
is
indicated
and
how
often
it
enters
blindly
because
what
was
important
has
been
forgotten
and
lost
of
course
we
must
grant
that
the
essence
of
representation
involves
very
great
difficulties
by
way
of
example
consider
so
ordinary
a
case
as
the
third
dimension
we
are
convinced
that
according
to
its
nature
it
is
much
more
complex
than
it
seems
to
be
we
are
compelled
to
believe
that
distance
is
not
a
matter
of
sensation
and
that
it
requires
to
be
explained
psychologists
indicate
that
the
representation
of
the
third
dimension
would
be
tremendously
difficult
without
the
help
of
experience
but
experience
is
something
relative
we
do
not
know
how
much
experience
any
man
possesses
or
its
nature
hence
we
never
can
know
clearly
to
what
degree
a
physical
vision
is
correct
if
we
do
not
see
other
means
of
verification
consider
now
what
is
required
in
the
assumption
of
the
idea
of
the
fourth
dimension
since
its
introduction
by
henry
more
this
idea
should
quite
have
altered
our
conception
of
space
but
we
do
not
know
how
many
cling
to
it
unconsciously
and
we
should
make
no
mistake
if
we
said
that
nobody
has
any
knowledge
of
how
his
neighbor
perceives
space
movement
is
another
thing
difficult
to
represent
or
imagine
you
can
determine
for
yourself
immediately
whether
you
can
imagine
even
a
slightly
complicated
movement
i
can
imagine
one
individual
condition
of
a
movement
after
another
sequentially
but
i
can
not
imagine
the
sequence
as
herbart
says
somewhere
a
successive
series
of
images
is
not
a
represented
succession
but
if
we
can
not
imagine
this
latter
what
do
we
imagine
is
not
what
it
ought
to
be
according
to
stricker
the
representation
of
movement
is
a
which
can
not
be
given
in
terms
of
any
other
sensory
quality
and
no
movement
can
be
remembered
without
the
awakening
a
experience
verifies
this
theory
the
awakening
of
the
muscular
sense
is
frequently
obvious
whenever
movement
is
thought
of
and
we
may
then
perceive
how
in
the
explanation
or
description
of
a
movement
the
innervation
which
follows
the
image
in
question
occurs
this
innervation
is
always
true
it
agrees
at
least
with
what
the
witness
has
himself
perceived
and
now
tries
to
renew
in
his
story
when
we
have
him
explain
for
example
how
some
man
had
been
choked
we
may
see
movements
of
his
hands
which
however
slight
and
obscure
still
definitely
indicate
that
he
is
trying
to
remember
what
he
has
seen
and
this
irrelevantly
of
what
he
is
saying
this
makes
it
possible
to
observe
the
alterations
of
images
in
the
individual
in
question
an
alteration
which
always
occurs
when
the
images
are
related
to
movements
it
follows
further
from
the
fact
that
movements
are
difficult
to
represent
that
the
witness
ought
not
to
be
expected
accurately
to
recall
them
stricker
says
that
for
a
long
time
he
could
not
image
a
and
succeeded
only
in
representing
one
single
instant
of
it
now
what
is
not
capable
of
representation
can
not
well
be
recalled
and
so
we
discover
that
it
merely
causes
trouble
to
ask
the
witness
to
describe
point
by
point
even
a
simple
sequence
the
witness
has
only
successive
images
and
even
if
the
particular
images
are
correct
he
has
nothing
objective
for
the
succession
itself
nothing
rooted
in
the
sequence
he
is
helped
merely
by
the
logic
of
events
and
his
memory
if
these
are
scanty
the
succession
of
images
is
scanty
and
therefore
the
reproduction
of
the
event
is
inadequate
hence
this
scantiness
is
as
little
remarkable
as
the
variety
of
description
in
various
witnesses
a
variety
due
to
the
fact
that
the
sequentialization
is
subjective
drawing
is
a
confirmation
of
the
fact
that
we
represent
only
a
single
instant
of
motion
for
a
picture
can
never
give
us
a
movement
but
only
a
single
state
within
that
movement
at
the
same
time
we
are
content
with
what
the
picture
renders
even
when
our
image
contains
only
this
simple
moment
of
movement
is
seen
or
heard
is
immediately
in
all
its
definiteness
content
of
schuppe
but
its
movement
is
not
the
influence
of
time
upon
images
is
hardly
indifferent
we
have
to
distinguish
the
time
necessary
for
the
construction
of
an
image
and
the
time
during
which
an
image
lasts
with
uniform
vividness
maudsley
believes
the
first
question
difficult
to
answer
he
leans
on
darwin
who
points
out
that
musicians
play
as
quickly
as
they
can
apprehend
the
notes
the
question
will
affect
the
lawyer
in
so
far
as
it
is
necessary
to
determine
whether
after
some
time
an
image
of
an
event
may
ensue
from
which
it
is
possible
to
infer
back
to
the
individuality
of
the
witness
no
other
example
can
be
used
here
because
on
the
rocky
problem
of
the
occurrence
of
images
are
shattered
even
the
regulative
arts
of
most
modern
psychophysics
the
second
problem
is
of
greater
significance
whether
any
practical
use
of
its
solution
can
be
made
i
can
not
say
but
it
urges
consideration
exner
has
observed
that
the
uniform
vividness
of
an
image
lasts
hardly
a
second
the
image
as
a
whole
does
not
disappear
in
this
time
but
its
content
endures
unchanged
for
so
long
at
most
then
it
fades
in
waves
the
correctness
of
this
description
may
be
tested
by
anybody
but
i
should
like
to
add
that
my
observations
of
my
own
images
indicate
that
in
the
course
of
a
progressive
repetition
of
the
recall
of
an
image
its
content
is
not
equally
capable
of
reproduction
i
believe
further
that
no
essential
leaps
occur
in
this
alteration
of
the
content
of
an
idea
but
that
the
alteration
moves
in
some
definite
direction
if
then
i
recall
the
idea
of
some
object
successively
i
will
imagine
it
not
at
one
time
bigger
then
smaller
then
again
bigger
etc
on
the
contrary
the
series
of
images
will
be
such
that
each
new
image
will
be
either
progressively
bigger
or
progressively
smaller
if
this
observation
of
mine
is
correct
and
the
phenomenon
is
not
purely
personal
description
becomes
of
great
value
in
examination
which
because
of
its
length
requires
the
repeated
recall
of
standardizing
images
and
this
in
its
turn
causes
an
alteration
in
the
ideational
content
we
frequently
observe
that
a
witness
persuades
himself
into
the
belief
of
some
definite
idea
in
the
course
of
his
examination
inasmuch
as
with
regard
to
some
matter
he
says
more
and
more
definite
things
at
the
end
than
at
the
beginning
this
may
possibly
be
contingent
on
the
alteration
of
frequently
recalled
ideas
one
could
make
use
of
the
process
which
is
involved
in
the
reproduction
of
the
idea
by
implying
it
and
so
not
being
compelled
to
return
endlessly
to
something
already
explained
how
other
people
construct
their
ideas
we
do
not
as
we
have
seen
know
and
the
difficulty
of
apprehending
the
ideas
or
images
of
other
people
many
authorities
clearly
indicate
topic
intellectual
processes
section
a
general
considerations
lichtenberg
said
somewhere
used
to
know
people
of
great
scholarship
in
whose
head
the
most
important
propositions
were
folded
up
in
excellent
order
but
i
know
what
occurred
there
whether
the
ideas
were
all
mannikins
or
all
little
women
there
were
no
results
in
one
corner
of
the
head
these
gentlemen
put
away
saltpeter
in
another
sulphur
in
a
third
charcoal
but
these
did
not
combine
into
gunpowder
then
again
there
are
people
in
whose
heads
everything
seeks
out
and
finds
everything
else
everything
pairs
off
with
everything
else
and
arranges
itself
what
lichtenberg
is
trying
to
do
is
to
indicate
that
the
cause
of
the
happy
condition
of
the
friends
is
imagination
that
imagination
is
influential
is
certain
but
it
is
equally
certain
that
the
human
understanding
is
so
different
with
different
people
as
to
permit
such
phenomena
as
lichtenberg
describes
i
do
not
want
to
discuss
the
quantity
of
understanding
i
shall
deal
this
time
with
its
quality
by
means
of
which
the
variety
of
its
uses
may
be
explained
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
think
of
the
understanding
as
capable
of
assuming
different
forms
if
it
were
it
would
be
possible
to
construct
from
the
concept
understanding
a
group
of
different
powers
whose
common
quality
would
come
to
us
but
with
regard
to
understanding
we
may
speak
only
of
more
or
less
and
we
must
think
of
the
difference
in
effect
in
terms
only
of
the
difference
of
the
forms
of
its
application
we
see
the
effects
of
the
understanding
alone
not
the
understanding
itself
and
however
various
a
burning
city
cast
iron
a
burn
and
steaming
water
may
be
we
recognize
that
in
spite
of
the
difference
of
effect
the
same
fire
has
brought
about
all
these
results
the
difference
in
the
uses
of
the
understanding
therefore
lies
in
the
manner
of
its
application
hence
these
applications
will
help
us
when
we
know
them
to
judge
the
value
of
what
they
offer
us
the
first
question
that
arises
when
we
are
dealing
with
an
important
witness
who
has
made
observations
and
inferences
is
this
intelligent
is
he
and
what
use
does
he
make
of
his
intelligence
that
is
what
are
his
processes
of
reasoning
i
heard
from
an
old
diplomat
whose
historic
name
is
as
significant
as
his
experience
that
he
made
use
of
a
specific
means
to
discover
what
kind
of
mind
a
person
had
he
used
to
tell
his
subjects
the
following
story
gentleman
carrying
a
small
casket
entered
a
steam
car
where
an
obtrusive
commercial
traveler
asked
him
at
once
what
was
contained
in
the
casket
mungo
is
inside
what
is
that
you
know
that
i
suffer
from
delirium
tremens
and
when
i
see
the
frightful
images
and
figures
i
let
my
mungo
out
and
he
eats
them
sir
these
images
and
figures
do
not
really
course
they
really
exist
but
my
mungo
really
exist
either
so
all
right
the
old
gentleman
asserted
that
he
could
judge
of
the
intelligence
of
his
interlocutor
by
the
manner
in
which
the
latter
received
this
story
of
course
it
is
impossible
to
tell
every
important
witness
the
story
of
mungo
but
something
similar
may
be
made
use
of
which
could
be
sought
out
of
the
material
in
the
case
whoever
has
anything
worthy
the
name
of
practice
will
then
be
able
to
judge
the
manner
of
the
approach
and
especially
the
degree
of
intelligence
he
possesses
the
mistake
must
not
be
made
however
that
this
requires
splendid
deductions
it
is
best
to
stick
to
simple
facts
golden
word
is
still
true
greatest
thing
is
to
understand
that
all
fact
is
theory
do
not
look
behind
phenomena
they
are
themselves
the
we
start
therefore
with
some
simple
fact
which
has
arisen
in
the
case
and
try
to
discover
what
the
witness
will
do
with
it
it
is
not
difficult
you
may
know
a
thing
badly
in
a
hundred
ways
but
you
know
it
well
in
only
one
way
if
the
witness
handles
the
fact
properly
we
may
trust
him
we
learn
moreover
from
this
handling
how
far
the
man
may
be
objective
his
perception
as
witness
means
to
him
only
an
experience
and
the
human
mind
may
not
collect
experiences
without
at
the
same
time
weaving
its
speculations
into
them
but
though
everyone
does
this
he
does
it
according
to
his
nature
and
nurture
there
is
little
that
is
as
significant
as
the
manner
the
intensity
and
the
direction
in
and
with
which
a
witness
introduces
his
speculation
into
the
story
of
his
experience
whole
sweeps
of
human
character
may
show
themselves
up
with
one
such
little
explanation
it
is
for
this
reason
that
kant
called
the
human
understanding
architectonic
it
aims
to
bring
together
all
its
knowledge
under
one
single
system
and
this
according
to
fixed
rules
and
systems
defined
by
the
needs
of
ordinary
mortals
only
the
genius
has
like
nature
his
own
unknown
system
and
we
do
not
need
to
count
on
this
rarest
of
exceptions
the
people
who
constitute
our
most
complicated
problems
are
the
average
and
insignificant
members
of
the
human
race
hume
cited
the
prophet
alexander
quite
justly
alexander
was
a
wise
prophet
who
selected
paphlagonis
as
the
first
scene
of
his
deception
because
the
people
there
were
extraordinarily
foolish
and
swallowed
with
pleasure
the
coarsest
of
swindles
they
had
heard
earlier
of
the
genuineness
and
power
of
the
prophet
and
the
smart
ones
laughed
at
him
the
fools
believed
and
spread
his
faith
his
cause
got
adherents
even
among
educated
people
and
finally
marcus
aurelius
himself
paid
the
matter
so
much
attention
as
to
rest
the
success
of
a
military
enterprise
on
a
prophecy
of
tacitus
narrates
how
vespasian
cured
a
blind
man
by
spitting
on
him
and
the
story
is
repeated
by
suetonius
we
must
never
forget
that
however
great
a
foolishness
may
be
there
is
always
somebody
to
commit
it
it
is
hume
again
i
think
who
so
excellently
describes
what
happens
when
some
inconceivable
story
is
told
to
uncritical
auditors
their
credulity
increases
the
shamelessness
his
shamelessness
convinces
their
credulity
thinking
for
yourself
is
a
rare
thing
and
the
more
one
is
involved
with
other
people
in
matters
of
importance
the
more
one
is
convinced
of
the
rarity
and
yet
so
little
is
demanded
in
thinking
abstract
the
red
of
blood
from
the
collective
impression
to
discover
the
same
concept
in
different
things
to
bring
together
under
the
same
notion
blood
and
beer
milk
and
snow
animals
do
not
do
this
it
is
i
might
suggest
that
in
the
first
place
various
animals
are
capable
of
something
of
the
sort
and
in
the
second
place
that
many
men
are
incapable
of
the
same
thing
the
greatest
of
all
mistakes
is
always
the
presupposition
that
whoever
has
done
anything
has
also
thought
about
doing
it
and
while
he
was
doing
it
this
is
especially
the
case
when
we
observe
that
many
people
repeatedly
speak
of
the
same
event
and
drive
us
to
the
opinion
that
there
must
be
some
intelligent
idea
behind
it
but
however
narrow
a
road
may
be
behind
it
there
may
be
any
number
of
others
in
series
we
also
are
bound
to
be
mistaken
if
we
presuppose
the
lack
of
reason
as
a
peculiarity
of
the
uneducated
only
and
accept
as
well
the
statements
of
people
who
possess
academic
training
but
not
everybody
who
damns
god
is
a
philosopher
and
neither
do
academic
persons
concern
themselves
unexceptionally
with
thinking
concerning
the
failure
of
our
studies
in
the
and
in
the
gymnasia
more
than
enough
has
been
written
but
helmholtz
in
his
famous
dissertation
the
relation
of
the
natural
sciences
to
the
whole
of
knowledge
has
revealed
the
reason
for
the
inadequacy
of
the
material
served
up
by
gymnasia
and
helmholtz
has
not
said
that
the
university
improves
the
situation
only
in
a
very
small
degree
but
it
may
be
understood
from
his
words
pupils
who
pass
from
our
to
exact
studies
have
two
defects
a
certain
laxity
in
the
application
of
universally
valid
laws
the
grammatical
rules
with
which
they
have
been
trained
are
as
a
matter
of
fact
buried
under
series
of
exceptions
the
pupils
hence
are
unaccustomed
to
trust
unconditionally
to
the
certainty
of
a
legitimate
consequence
of
some
fixed
universal
law
they
are
altogether
too
much
inclined
to
depend
upon
authority
even
where
they
can
judge
for
even
if
helmholtz
is
right
it
is
important
for
the
lawyer
to
recognize
the
distinction
between
the
witness
who
has
the
gymnasium
behind
him
and
the
educated
man
who
has
helped
himself
without
that
institution
our
time
which
has
invented
the
ph
which
wants
to
do
everything
for
the
public
school
and
is
eager
to
cripple
the
classical
training
in
the
gymnasium
has
wholly
forgotten
that
the
incomparable
value
of
the
latter
does
not
lie
in
the
minimum
of
latin
and
greek
which
the
student
has
acquired
but
in
the
disciplinary
intellectual
drill
contained
in
the
grammar
of
the
ancient
tongues
it
is
superfluous
to
make
fun
of
the
fact
that
the
technician
writes
on
his
visiting
cards
stud
eng
or
stud
mech
and
can
not
pronounce
the
words
the
abbreviations
stand
for
that
he
becomes
ph
and
can
not
translate
his
title
these
are
side
issues
but
it
is
forgotten
that
the
total
examination
in
which
the
public
school
pupil
presents
his
hastily
crammed
latin
and
greek
never
implies
a
careful
training
in
his
most
impressionable
period
of
life
hence
the
criminalist
repeatedly
discovers
that
the
capacity
for
trained
thinking
belongs
mainly
to
the
person
who
has
been
drilled
for
eight
years
in
greek
and
latin
grammar
we
criminalists
have
much
experience
in
this
matter
first
point
would
for
legal
purposes
require
very
broad
interpretation
of
the
term
valid
laws
extending
it
also
to
laws
in
the
judicial
sense
of
the
word
the
assertion
is
frequently
made
that
laws
are
passed
in
the
united
states
in
order
that
they
might
not
be
obeyed
and
political
regulations
are
obeyed
by
the
public
for
at
most
seven
weeks
of
course
the
united
states
is
no
exception
it
seems
as
if
the
respect
for
law
is
declining
everywhere
and
if
this
decline
occurs
in
one
field
no
other
is
likely
to
be
free
from
it
a
certain
subjective
or
egoistic
attitude
is
potent
in
this
regard
for
people
in
the
main
conceive
the
law
to
be
made
only
for
others
they
themselves
are
exceptions
narrow
unconditional
adherence
to
general
norms
is
not
modern
and
this
fact
is
to
be
seen
not
only
in
the
excuses
offered
but
also
in
the
statements
of
witnesses
who
expect
others
to
follow
prescriptions
approximately
and
themselves
hardly
at
all
this
fact
has
tremendous
influence
on
the
conceptions
and
constructions
of
people
and
a
failure
to
take
it
into
consideration
means
considerable
error
not
less
unimportant
is
the
second
point
raised
in
the
notion
of
to
judge
for
himself
is
business
and
should
be
required
of
everybody
even
if
nobody
should
have
the
happy
thought
of
making
use
of
the
better
insight
the
dependent
person
who
always
wants
to
go
further
will
lead
himself
into
doubtful
situations
the
three
important
factors
school
newspaper
and
theater
have
reached
an
extraordinary
degree
of
power
people
apperceive
think
and
feel
as
these
three
teach
them
and
finally
it
becomes
second
nature
to
follow
this
line
of
least
resistance
and
to
seek
intellectual
conformity
we
know
well
enough
what
consequences
this
has
in
law
and
each
one
of
us
can
tell
how
witnesses
present
us
stories
which
we
believe
to
rest
on
their
own
insight
but
which
show
themselves
finally
to
depend
upon
the
opinion
of
some
other
element
we
frequently
base
our
constructions
upon
the
remarkable
and
convincing
unanimity
of
such
witnesses
when
upon
closer
examination
we
might
discover
that
this
unanimity
has
a
single
source
if
we
make
this
discovery
it
is
fortunate
for
only
time
and
labor
have
then
been
lost
and
no
mistake
has
been
committed
but
if
the
discovery
is
not
made
the
unanimity
remains
an
important
but
really
an
unreliable
means
of
proof
section
b
the
mechanism
of
thinking
since
the
remarkable
dissertation
of
ostwald
on
we
have
been
standing
at
a
turning
point
which
looks
toward
a
new
view
of
the
world
we
do
not
know
whether
the
of
some
of
the
scientists
will
hold
or
whether
we
shall
be
able
to
think
everything
in
terms
of
energy
we
merely
observe
that
the
supposedly
invincible
principles
of
scientific
materialism
are
shaken
frederick
the
great
in
a
letter
to
voltaire
says
something
which
suggests
he
was
the
first
to
have
thought
of
the
purely
mechanical
nature
of
thought
cabanis
had
said
briefly
that
the
brain
secretes
thought
as
the
liver
bile
tyndall
expressed
this
conception
more
cautiously
and
demanded
merely
the
confession
that
every
act
of
consciousness
implies
a
definite
molecular
condition
of
the
brain
while
declared
that
we
could
not
explain
certain
psychical
processes
and
events
by
knowledge
of
the
material
processes
in
the
brain
shall
make
no
picture
or
comparison
but
see
as
directly
as
the
nature
of
our
spirit
will
permit
ostwald
tells
us
and
it
is
well
to
stick
to
this
advice
we
need
neither
to
cast
aside
the
mechanical
view
of
the
world
nor
to
accept
energism
neither
of
them
is
required
but
according
to
the
teachings
of
the
latter
we
shall
be
enabled
to
recognize
the
meaning
of
natural
law
in
the
determination
of
how
actual
events
are
conditioned
by
possible
ones
and
thus
we
shall
see
that
the
form
that
all
natural
laws
turn
to
expresses
the
mediation
of
an
invariable
a
quantity
that
remains
unchangeable
even
when
all
the
other
elements
in
the
formula
of
a
possible
event
alter
within
the
limits
defined
by
the
law
every
science
must
provide
its
own
philosophy
and
it
is
our
duty
to
know
properly
and
to
understand
clearly
how
far
we
may
perceive
connections
between
the
physical
qualities
of
any
one
of
our
witnesses
and
his
psychic
nature
we
will
draw
no
inferences
ourselves
but
we
will
take
note
of
what
does
not
explain
itself
and
apply
to
experts
to
explain
what
we
can
not
this
is
especially
necessary
where
the
relation
of
the
normal
to
the
abnormal
becomes
a
question
the
normal
effects
to
be
spoken
of
are
very
numerous
but
we
shall
consider
only
a
few
the
first
is
the
connection
of
symbol
and
symbolized
circumstance
that
the
symbol
on
its
side
of
the
union
of
the
two
becomes
perfectly
clear
while
the
symbolized
object
is
rather
confused
is
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
symbol
recalls
its
object
more
quickly
than
the
object
the
symbol
the
tool
recalls
its
use
more
quickly
than
the
purpose
its
instrument
name
and
word
recall
more
quickly
reliably
and
energetically
the
objects
they
stand
for
than
do
the
objects
their
this
matter
is
more
important
than
it
looks
at
first
glance
inasmuch
as
the
particles
of
time
with
which
we
are
dealing
are
greater
than
those
with
which
modern
psychologists
have
to
deal
so
large
indeed
that
they
may
be
perceived
in
practice
we
lay
stress
during
the
examination
when
we
are
in
doubt
about
the
correctness
of
the
expected
answer
upon
the
promptness
and
rapidity
with
which
it
is
given
drawn
out
tentative
and
uncertain
answers
we
take
for
a
sign
that
the
witness
either
is
unable
or
unwilling
to
give
his
replies
honestly
if
however
psychologically
there
are
real
reasons
for
variation
in
the
time
in
which
an
answer
is
given
reasons
which
do
not
depend
on
its
correctness
we
must
seek
out
this
correctness
suppose
that
we
have
before
us
a
case
in
which
the
name
awakens
more
quickly
and
reliably
the
idea
of
the
person
to
whom
it
belongs
than
conversely
this
occurs
to
any
one
of
us
and
often
we
can
not
remember
the
name
of
even
a
close
friend
for
a
greater
or
shorter
period
but
we
very
rarely
find
that
we
do
not
think
of
the
appearance
of
the
individual
whose
name
we
hear
mentioned
but
it
would
be
wrong
to
relate
this
phenomenon
to
certain
qualities
which
contradict
it
only
apparently
when
i
examine
old
statutes
which
i
myself
have
worked
with
and
review
the
names
of
the
series
i
recall
that
i
had
something
to
do
with
this
jones
smith
black
or
white
and
i
recall
what
the
business
was
but
i
do
not
recall
their
appearance
the
reason
is
first
of
all
the
fact
that
during
the
trial
i
did
not
care
about
the
names
which
served
as
a
means
of
distinguishing
one
from
the
other
and
they
might
for
that
purpose
have
been
etc
hence
the
faces
and
names
were
not
as
definitely
associated
as
they
ordinarily
are
moreover
failure
to
recall
is
a
substitution
for
each
other
of
the
many
tanti
quanti
that
we
take
up
in
our
daily
routine
when
we
have
had
especial
business
with
any
particular
individual
we
do
remember
his
face
when
his
name
is
mentioned
if
then
a
witness
does
not
quickly
recall
the
name
of
something
he
is
thinking
of
but
identifies
it
immediately
when
the
name
is
given
him
you
have
a
natural
psychological
event
which
itself
has
no
bearing
on
the
truth
or
falsity
of
his
testimony
the
same
relation
is
naturally
to
be
found
in
all
cases
of
parallel
phenomena
names
symbols
definitions
etc
it
applies
also
to
the
problem
of
the
alteration
in
the
rapidity
of
psychical
processes
with
the
time
of
the
day
according
to
bechterew
and
higier
there
is
an
increase
in
psychical
capacity
from
morning
to
noon
then
a
dropping
until
five
in
the
afternoon
then
an
increase
until
nine
in
the
evening
and
finally
a
sinking
until
twelve
midnight
there
is
of
course
no
doubt
that
these
investigators
have
correctly
collected
their
material
that
their
results
shall
possess
general
validity
is
however
not
so
certain
the
facts
are
such
that
much
depends
not
only
on
the
individual
character
but
also
on
the
instant
of
examination
one
hears
various
assertions
of
individuals
at
times
when
they
are
most
quick
to
apprehend
and
at
their
best
and
hence
it
is
hardly
possible
to
draw
a
general
rule
from
such
phenomena
one
may
be
wide
awake
in
the
morning
another
in
the
forenoon
a
third
at
night
and
at
each
time
other
people
may
be
at
their
worst
in
a
similar
fashion
the
psychic
disposition
varies
not
only
during
the
day
but
from
day
to
day
so
far
as
my
observations
go
the
only
thing
uncontradicted
is
the
fact
that
the
period
between
noon
and
five
in
the
afternoon
is
not
a
favorable
one
i
do
not
believe
however
that
it
would
be
correct
to
say
that
the
few
hours
after
the
noon
dinner
are
the
worst
in
the
day
for
people
who
eat
their
dinners
at
about
four
or
five
assure
me
that
from
one
to
five
in
the
afternoon
they
can
not
work
so
well
these
facts
may
have
a
value
for
us
in
so
far
as
we
can
succeed
in
avoiding
the
trial
of
important
cases
which
require
especial
consideration
during
the
time
mentioned
section
c
the
subconscious
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
importance
of
unconscious
operations
in
legal
procedure
is
undervalued
we
could
establish
much
that
is
significant
concerning
an
individual
whose
unconscious
doings
we
knew
for
as
a
rule
we
perform
unconsciously
things
that
are
deeply
habitual
therefore
first
of
all
what
everybody
does
walk
greet
your
neighbor
dodge
eat
etc
secondly
we
perform
unconsciously
things
to
which
we
have
become
accustomed
in
accordance
with
our
especial
characters
when
during
my
work
i
rise
get
a
glass
of
water
drink
it
and
set
the
glass
aside
again
without
having
the
slightest
suspicion
of
having
done
so
i
must
agree
that
this
was
possible
only
in
my
residence
and
environment
and
that
it
was
possible
to
nobody
else
not
so
familiar
the
coachman
perhaps
puts
the
horses
into
the
stable
rubs
them
down
and
thinks
of
something
else
while
doing
so
he
has
performed
unconsciously
what
another
could
not
it
might
happen
that
i
roll
a
cigarette
while
i
am
working
and
put
it
aside
after
awhile
i
roll
a
second
and
a
third
and
sometimes
i
have
four
cigarettes
side
by
side
i
needed
to
smoke
had
prepared
a
cigarette
and
simply
because
i
had
to
use
my
hands
in
writing
i
laid
the
cigarette
aside
in
consequence
the
need
to
smoke
was
not
satisfied
and
the
process
was
repeated
this
indicates
what
complicated
things
may
be
unconsciously
performed
if
only
the
conditions
are
but
it
also
indicates
what
the
limits
of
unconscious
action
are
i
had
not
forgotten
what
would
satisfy
my
need
to
smoke
nor
where
my
cigarette
paper
was
nor
how
to
make
a
cigarette
but
i
had
forgotten
that
i
had
made
a
cigarette
without
having
smoked
it
the
activities
first
named
have
been
repeated
thousands
of
times
while
the
last
had
only
just
been
performed
and
therefore
had
not
become
mechanical
lipps
calls
attention
to
another
instance
may
be
that
i
am
capable
of
retaining
every
word
of
a
speech
and
of
observing
at
the
same
time
the
expression
which
accompanies
the
speech
i
might
be
equally
able
to
trace
a
noise
which
occurs
on
the
street
and
still
to
pay
sufficient
attention
to
the
speech
on
the
other
hand
i
should
lose
the
thread
of
the
speech
if
i
were
required
at
the
same
time
to
think
of
the
play
of
feature
and
the
noise
expressed
in
general
terms
idea
a
may
possibly
get
on
with
idea
b
and
even
idea
c
but
b
and
c
together
make
a
impossible
this
clearly
indicates
that
b
and
c
in
themselves
have
opposed
a
and
inhibited
it
in
some
degree
but
that
only
the
summation
of
their
inhibition
could
serve
really
to
exclude
this
is
certainly
correct
and
may
perhaps
be
more
frequently
made
use
of
when
it
is
necessary
to
judge
how
much
an
individual
would
have
done
at
one
and
the
same
time
and
how
much
he
would
have
done
unconsciously
an
approximation
of
the
possibilities
can
always
be
made
such
complicated
processes
go
down
to
the
simplest
operations
aubert
indicates
for
example
that
in
riding
a
horse
at
gallop
you
jump
and
only
later
observe
whether
you
have
jumped
to
the
right
or
the
left
and
the
physician
f√∂rster
told
aubert
that
his
patients
often
did
not
know
how
to
look
toward
right
or
left
at
the
same
time
everybody
remembers
how
when
he
is
doing
it
unconsciously
and
it
may
often
be
observed
that
people
have
to
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
or
the
gesture
of
eating
in
order
to
discover
what
is
right
and
what
left
although
they
are
unconsciously
quite
certain
of
these
directions
still
broader
activities
are
bound
up
with
this
unconscious
psychosis
activities
for
us
of
importance
when
the
accused
later
give
us
different
and
better
explanations
than
at
the
beginning
and
when
they
have
not
had
the
opportunity
to
study
the
case
out
and
make
additional
discoveries
or
to
think
it
over
in
the
mean
time
they
then
say
honestly
that
the
new
really
probable
exposition
has
suddenly
occurred
to
them
as
a
rule
we
do
not
believe
such
statements
and
we
are
wrong
for
even
when
this
sudden
vision
appears
improbable
and
not
easily
realizable
the
witnesses
have
explained
it
in
this
way
only
because
they
do
not
know
the
psychological
process
which
as
a
matter
of
fact
consisted
of
subconscious
thinking
the
brain
does
not
merely
receive
impressions
unconsciously
it
registers
them
without
the
of
consciousness
works
them
over
unconsciously
awakens
the
latent
residua
without
the
help
of
consciousness
and
reacts
like
an
organ
endowed
with
organic
life
toward
the
inner
stimuli
which
it
receives
from
other
parts
of
the
body
that
this
also
influences
the
activity
of
the
imagination
goethe
has
indicated
in
his
statement
to
schiller
must
work
silently
in
me
for
a
very
long
time
before
they
show
themselves
willing
to
be
used
in
other
respects
everybody
knows
something
about
this
unconscious
intellectual
activity
frequently
we
plague
ourselves
with
the
attempt
to
bring
order
into
the
flow
of
ideas
and
we
fail
then
the
next
time
without
our
having
thought
of
the
matter
in
the
interval
we
find
everything
smooth
and
clear
it
is
on
this
fact
that
the
various
popular
maxims
rest
to
think
a
thing
over
or
to
sleep
on
it
etc
the
unconscious
activity
of
thought
has
a
great
share
in
what
has
been
thought
out
a
very
distinctive
r√¥le
belongs
to
the
coincidence
of
conscious
attention
with
unconscious
an
explanation
of
this
process
will
help
us
perhaps
to
explain
many
incomprehensible
and
improbable
things
the
unconscious
psychic
activities
going
up
and
down
smoking
playing
with
the
hands
conversation
compete
with
the
conscious
or
with
other
unconscious
activities
for
psychic
energy
hence
a
important
idea
may
lead
us
to
stop
walking
to
remain
without
a
rule
of
action
may
make
the
smoker
drop
his
smoking
the
explanation
is
as
follows
i
possess
let
us
say
units
of
psychic
energy
which
i
might
use
in
attention
now
we
find
it
difficult
to
attend
for
twenty
seconds
to
one
point
and
more
so
to
direct
our
to
one
thing
hence
i
apply
only
let
us
say
units
to
the
object
in
question
and
apply
units
to
the
unconscious
play
of
ideas
etc
now
if
the
first
object
suddenly
demands
even
more
attention
it
draws
off
the
other
ten
units
and
i
must
stop
playing
for
absolutely
without
attention
even
unconscious
attention
nothing
can
be
done
this
very
frequent
and
phenomenon
shows
us
first
of
all
the
unconscious
activities
in
their
agreement
with
the
conscious
inasmuch
as
we
behave
in
the
same
way
when
both
are
interrupted
by
the
demand
of
another
thing
on
our
attention
if
a
row
suddenly
breaks
out
before
my
window
i
will
interrupt
an
unconscious
drumming
with
the
fingers
as
well
as
a
conscious
reading
so
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
draw
any
conclusion
concerning
the
nature
of
these
activities
from
the
mere
interruption
or
the
manner
of
that
interruption
this
similarity
is
an
additional
ground
for
the
fact
that
what
is
done
unconsciously
may
be
very
complex
no
absolute
boundary
may
be
drawn
and
hence
we
can
derive
no
proof
of
the
incorrectness
of
an
assertion
from
the
performance
itself
from
has
been
done
unconsciously
only
human
nature
its
habits
idiosyncrasies
and
its
contemporary
environment
can
give
us
any
norm
section
d
subjective
conditions
we
have
already
seen
that
our
ideation
has
the
self
for
center
and
point
of
reference
and
we
shall
later
see
that
the
kind
of
thinking
which
exclusively
relates
all
events
to
itself
or
the
closest
relations
of
the
self
is
according
to
erdmann
the
essence
of
stupidity
there
is
however
a
series
of
intellectual
processes
in
which
the
thinker
pushes
his
self
into
the
foreground
with
more
or
less
justification
judging
everything
else
and
studying
everything
else
in
the
light
of
it
presupposing
in
others
what
he
finds
in
himself
and
exhibiting
a
greater
interest
in
himself
than
may
be
his
proper
share
such
ideations
are
frequently
to
be
found
in
natures
i
know
a
genial
teacher
the
first
in
his
profession
who
is
so
deeply
absorbed
in
his
thinking
that
he
never
carries
money
watch
or
keys
because
he
forgets
and
loses
them
when
in
the
examination
of
some
critical
case
he
needs
a
coin
he
turns
to
his
auditors
with
the
question
one
of
you
gentlemen
may
some
have
a
quarter
with
you
he
judges
from
his
habit
of
not
carrying
money
with
him
that
to
carry
it
is
to
be
presupposed
as
a
and
the
appearance
of
a
quarter
in
this
crowded
auditorium
must
be
the
same
thing
is
true
with
some
of
the
most
habitual
processes
of
some
of
the
most
ordinary
people
if
a
man
sees
a
directory
in
which
his
name
must
be
mentioned
he
looks
it
up
and
studies
it
if
he
sees
a
group
photograph
in
which
he
also
occurs
he
looks
up
his
own
picture
and
when
the
most
miserable
cheater
who
is
traveling
under
a
false
name
picks
that
out
he
will
seek
it
out
of
his
relationships
will
either
alter
his
real
name
or
slightly
vary
the
maiden
name
of
his
mother
or
deduce
it
from
his
place
of
birth
or
simply
make
use
of
his
christian
name
but
he
will
not
be
likely
to
move
far
from
his
precious
self
that
similar
things
are
true
for
readers
goethe
told
us
when
he
showed
us
that
everything
that
anybody
reads
interests
him
only
when
he
finds
himself
or
his
activities
therein
so
goethe
explains
that
business
men
and
men
of
the
world
apprehend
a
scientific
dissertation
better
than
the
really
learned
habitually
hear
no
more
of
it
than
what
they
have
learned
or
taught
and
with
which
they
meet
their
it
is
properly
indicated
that
every
language
has
the
largest
number
of
terms
for
those
things
which
are
most
important
to
those
who
speak
it
thus
we
are
told
that
the
arabians
have
as
many
as
words
for
camel
for
horse
and
for
lion
richness
of
form
and
use
always
belong
together
as
is
shown
in
the
fact
that
the
auxiliaries
and
those
verbs
most
often
used
are
everywhere
the
most
irregular
this
fact
may
be
very
important
in
examinations
for
definite
inferences
concerning
the
nature
and
affairs
of
the
witness
may
be
drawn
from
the
manner
and
frequency
with
which
he
uses
words
and
whether
he
possesses
an
especially
large
number
of
forms
in
any
particular
direction
the
fact
is
that
we
make
our
conceptions
in
accordance
with
the
things
as
we
have
seen
them
and
so
completely
persuade
ourselves
of
the
truth
of
one
definite
partial
definition
that
sometimes
we
wonder
at
a
phenomenon
without
judging
that
it
might
have
been
expected
to
be
otherwise
when
i
first
became
a
student
at
strassbourg
i
wondered
subconsciously
when
i
heard
the
ragged
gamins
talk
french
fluently
i
knew
indeed
that
it
was
their
but
i
was
so
accustomed
to
viewing
all
french
as
a
sign
of
higher
education
that
this
knowledge
in
the
gamins
made
me
marvel
when
i
was
a
child
i
once
had
to
bid
my
grandfather
adieu
very
early
while
he
was
still
in
bed
i
still
recall
the
vivid
astonishment
of
my
perception
that
grandfather
awoke
without
his
habitual
spectacles
upon
his
nose
i
must
have
known
that
spectacles
are
as
superfluous
as
uncomfortable
and
dangerous
when
one
is
sleeping
and
i
should
not
even
with
most
cursory
thinking
have
supposed
that
he
would
have
worn
his
spectacles
during
the
night
but
as
i
was
accustomed
always
to
see
my
grandfather
with
spectacles
when
he
did
not
have
them
i
wondered
at
it
such
instances
are
of
especial
importance
when
the
judge
is
himself
making
observations
examining
the
premises
of
the
crime
studying
corpora
delicti
because
we
often
suppose
ourselves
to
see
extraordinary
and
illegal
things
simply
because
we
have
been
habituated
to
seeing
things
otherwise
we
even
construct
and
name
according
to
this
habit
taine
narrates
the
instructive
story
of
a
little
girl
who
wore
a
medal
around
her
throat
of
which
she
was
told
le
bon
when
the
child
once
saw
her
uncle
with
a
lorgnon
around
his
neck
she
said
le
bon
dieu
de
mon
and
since
i
heard
the
story
i
have
repeatedly
had
the
opportunity
to
think
aussi
le
bon
dieu
de
cet
a
single
word
which
indicates
how
a
man
denotes
a
thing
defines
for
us
his
nature
his
character
and
his
circumstances
for
the
same
reason
that
everything
interests
us
more
according
to
the
degree
it
involves
us
personally
we
do
not
examine
facts
and
completely
overlook
them
though
they
are
later
shown
to
be
unshakable
without
our
being
able
to
explain
their
causal
nexus
if
however
we
know
causes
and
relationships
these
facts
become
portions
of
our
habitual
mental
equipment
any
practitioner
knows
how
true
this
is
and
how
especially
visible
during
the
examination
of
witnesses
who
ignore
facts
which
to
us
seem
in
the
nature
of
the
case
important
and
definitive
in
such
cases
we
must
first
of
all
not
assume
that
these
facts
have
not
occurred
because
the
witness
has
not
explained
them
or
has
overlooked
them
we
must
proceed
as
suggested
in
order
to
validate
the
relevant
circumstances
by
means
of
the
witness
we
must
teach
him
the
conditions
and
relationships
until
they
become
portions
of
his
habitual
mental
machinery
i
do
not
assert
that
this
is
easy
on
the
contrary
i
say
that
whoever
is
able
to
do
this
is
the
most
effective
of
examiners
and
shows
again
that
the
witness
is
no
more
than
an
instrument
which
is
valueless
in
the
hands
of
the
bounder
but
which
can
accomplish
all
sorts
of
things
in
the
hands
of
the
master
one
must
beware
however
of
too
free
use
of
the
most
comfortable
means
that
of
examples
when
newton
said
addiscendis
scientiis
exempla
plus
prosunt
quam
praecepta
he
was
not
addressing
criminalists
but
he
might
have
been
as
might
also
kant
when
he
proved
that
thinking
in
examples
is
dangerous
because
it
allows
the
use
of
real
thinking
for
which
it
is
not
a
substitute
to
lapse
that
this
fact
is
one
reason
for
the
danger
of
examples
is
certain
but
the
chief
reason
at
least
for
the
lawyer
is
the
fact
that
an
example
requires
not
equality
but
mere
similarity
the
degree
of
similarity
is
not
expressed
and
the
auditor
has
no
standard
for
the
degree
of
similarity
in
the
mind
of
the
speaker
analogia
is
correct
and
it
may
happen
that
the
example
might
be
falsely
conceived
that
similarity
may
be
mistaken
for
equality
or
at
least
that
there
should
be
ignorance
of
the
inequality
examples
therefore
are
to
be
used
only
in
the
most
extreme
cases
and
only
in
such
wise
that
the
nature
of
the
example
is
made
very
clearly
obvious
and
its
incorrectness
warned
against
there
are
several
special
conditions
not
to
be
overlooked
one
of
these
is
the
influence
of
expectation
whoever
expects
anything
sees
hears
and
constructs
only
in
the
suspense
of
this
expectation
and
neglects
all
competing
events
most
astoundingly
whoever
keenly
expects
any
person
is
sensible
only
of
the
creaking
of
the
garden
door
he
is
interested
in
all
sounds
which
resemble
it
and
which
he
can
immediately
distinguish
with
quite
abnormal
acuteness
everything
else
so
disappears
that
even
powerful
sounds
at
any
event
more
powerful
than
that
of
the
creaking
gate
are
overlooked
this
may
afford
some
explanation
for
the
very
different
statements
we
often
receive
from
numerous
observers
of
the
same
event
each
one
had
expected
a
different
thing
and
hence
had
perceived
and
had
ignored
different
things
again
the
opposition
of
the
i
and
you
in
the
person
himself
is
a
noteworthy
thing
according
to
noel
this
is
done
particularly
when
one
perceives
own
foolish
management
could
you
have
behaved
so
foolishly
generalized
it
might
be
restated
as
the
fact
that
people
say
you
to
themselves
whenever
the
dual
nature
of
the
ego
becomes
visible
whenever
one
no
longer
entertains
a
former
opinion
or
when
one
is
undecided
and
carries
about
contradictory
intentions
or
whenever
one
wants
to
compel
himself
to
some
achievement
hence
could
you
have
done
this
you
do
this
or
should
you
not
simply
shall
tell
the
more
na√Øve
people
often
report
such
inner
dialogues
faithfully
and
without
considering
that
they
give
themselves
away
thereby
inasmuch
as
the
judge
learns
at
least
that
when
this
occurred
the
practical
ego
was
a
stranger
to
the
considering
ego
through
whom
the
subjective
conditions
of
the
circumstances
involved
may
be
explained
what
people
call
excellent
characterizes
them
excellences
are
for
each
man
those
qualities
from
which
others
get
the
most
advantage
charity
mercy
honesty
integrity
courage
prudence
assiduity
and
however
else
anything
that
is
good
and
brave
may
be
called
are
always
of
use
to
the
other
fellow
but
barely
and
only
indirectly
the
possessor
of
the
virtues
hence
we
praise
the
latter
and
spur
others
on
to
identical
qualities
to
our
advantage
this
is
very
barren
and
prosaic
but
true
naturally
not
everybody
has
advantage
in
the
identical
virtues
of
other
people
only
in
those
which
are
of
use
to
their
individual
situation
charity
is
of
no
use
to
the
rich
and
courage
of
no
use
to
the
protected
hence
people
give
themselves
away
more
frequently
than
they
seem
to
and
even
when
no
revelation
of
their
inner
lives
can
be
attained
from
witnesses
and
accused
they
always
express
enough
to
show
what
they
consider
to
be
virtue
and
what
not
hartenstein
characterizes
hegel
as
a
person
who
made
his
opponents
out
of
straw
and
rags
in
order
to
be
able
to
beat
them
down
the
more
easily
this
characterizes
not
only
hegel
but
a
large
group
of
individuals
whose
daily
life
consists
of
it
just
as
there
is
nowhere
any
particularly
definite
boundary
between
sanity
and
foolishness
and
everything
flows
into
everything
else
so
it
is
with
men
and
their
testimonies
normal
and
abnormal
from
the
sober
clear
and
true
testimony
of
the
former
to
the
fanciful
and
impossible
assertions
of
the
latter
there
is
a
straight
slowly
rising
road
on
which
testimony
appears
progressively
less
true
and
more
impossible
no
man
can
say
where
the
quality
of
foolishness
begins
nervousness
excitement
hysteria
illusion
fantasy
and
pathoformic
lies
are
the
shadings
which
may
be
distinguished
and
the
quantity
of
untruth
in
such
testimonies
may
be
demonstrated
from
one
to
one
hundred
per
without
needing
to
skip
a
single
degree
we
must
not
however
ignore
and
simply
set
aside
even
the
testimony
of
the
outlaws
and
doubtful
persons
because
also
they
may
contain
some
truth
and
we
must
pay
still
more
attention
to
such
as
contain
a
larger
percentage
of
truth
but
with
this
regard
we
have
our
smart
lawyers
who
are
and
it
is
they
who
build
the
real
men
of
straw
which
cost
us
so
much
effort
and
labor
the
form
is
indeed
correct
but
the
content
is
straw
and
the
figure
appears
subjectively
dangerous
only
to
its
creator
and
he
has
created
it
because
he
likes
to
fight
but
desires
also
to
conquer
easily
the
desire
to
construct
such
figures
and
to
present
them
to
the
authorities
is
widespread
and
dangerous
through
our
habit
of
seeking
some
particular
motive
hatred
jealousy
a
quarrel
revenge
etc
if
we
do
not
find
it
we
assume
that
such
a
motive
is
absent
and
take
the
accusation
at
least
for
the
time
to
be
true
we
must
not
forget
that
frequently
there
can
be
no
other
defining
motive
than
the
desire
to
construct
a
man
of
straw
and
to
conquer
him
if
this
explanation
does
not
serve
we
may
make
use
finally
of
a
curious
phenomenon
called
by
lazarus
which
repeats
itself
at
various
levels
of
life
in
rather
younger
people
if
we
take
this
concept
in
its
widest
application
we
will
classify
under
it
all
forms
that
contain
the
almost
invincible
demand
for
attention
for
talking
about
oneself
for
growing
famous
on
the
part
of
people
who
have
neither
the
capacity
nor
the
perseverance
to
accomplish
any
extraordinary
thing
and
who
hence
make
use
of
forbidden
and
even
criminal
means
to
shove
their
personalities
into
the
foreground
and
so
to
attain
their
end
to
this
class
belong
all
those
girls
who
accuse
men
of
seduction
and
rape
they
aim
by
this
means
to
make
themselves
interesting
so
do
the
women
who
announce
all
kinds
of
persecutions
which
make
them
talked
about
and
condoled
with
and
the
numerous
people
who
want
to
do
something
remarkable
and
commit
arson
then
again
certain
political
criminals
of
all
times
who
became
with
one
single
stab
and
hence
devoted
their
otherwise
worthless
lives
thereto
and
finally
even
all
those
who
when
having
suffered
from
some
theft
arson
or
bodily
harm
defined
their
damage
as
considerably
greater
than
it
actually
was
not
for
the
purpose
of
recovering
their
losses
but
for
the
purpose
of
being
discussed
and
condoled
with
as
a
rule
it
is
not
difficult
to
recognize
this
inasmuch
as
it
betrays
itself
through
the
lack
of
other
motives
and
appears
definitely
when
the
intent
is
examined
and
exaggerations
are
discovered
which
otherwise
would
not
appear
topic
association
of
ideas
section
the
question
of
association
is
essentially
significant
for
lawyers
because
in
many
cases
it
is
only
by
use
of
it
that
we
can
discover
the
conditions
of
the
existence
of
certain
conceptions
by
means
of
which
witnesses
may
be
brought
to
remember
and
tell
the
truth
without
hypnotizing
them
or
overtesting
the
correctness
of
their
statements
we
will
cursorily
make
a
few
general
observations
only
concerning
the
law
of
association
very
little
has
been
learned
since
the
time
of
aristotle
it
is
determined
by
similarity
the
common
quality
of
the
symbol
contrast
because
every
image
involves
opposition
between
its
extremes
simultaneity
the
being
together
of
outer
or
inner
objects
in
space
succession
images
call
each
other
out
in
the
same
order
in
which
they
occur
hume
recognized
only
three
grounds
of
association
of
objects
similarity
contact
in
time
and
space
and
causality
theo
lipps
recognizes
as
the
really
different
grounds
of
association
only
similarity
and
simultaneity
the
simultaneity
of
their
presence
in
the
mind
especially
if
however
simultaneity
is
to
be
taken
in
this
sense
it
may
be
considered
the
sole
ground
of
association
for
if
the
images
are
not
simultaneous
there
can
be
no
question
of
association
simultaneity
in
the
mind
is
only
the
second
process
for
images
are
simultaneous
in
the
mind
only
because
they
have
occurred
simultaneously
existed
in
the
same
space
were
similar
etc
m√ºnsterberg
who
dealt
with
the
matter
and
got
important
results
points
out
that
all
inner
associations
like
similarity
contrast
may
be
reduced
to
external
association
and
all
the
external
associations
even
that
of
temporal
sequence
may
be
reduced
to
and
all
are
psychophysically
intelligible
further
fundamental
error
of
all
association
processes
leading
to
incorrect
connection
of
ideas
must
be
contained
in
their
incompleteness
one
idea
was
associated
with
another
the
latter
with
a
third
and
then
we
connect
the
first
with
the
third
a
thing
we
should
not
have
done
since
the
first
while
it
with
the
second
was
also
connected
with
many
but
even
this
account
does
not
account
for
certain
difficulties
because
some
associations
are
simply
set
aside
although
they
should
have
occurred
man
is
inclined
according
to
stricker
to
inhibit
associations
which
are
not
implied
in
his
complexes
if
we
find
direct
contradiction
with
regard
to
associations
the
way
out
is
not
easy
we
have
then
first
to
consider
how
by
comparatively
remote
indirection
to
introduce
those
conditions
into
the
complex
which
will
give
rise
to
the
association
but
such
a
consideration
is
often
a
big
problem
in
pedagogy
and
we
are
rarely
in
the
position
of
teaching
the
witness
there
is
still
the
additional
difficulty
that
we
frequently
do
not
know
the
circumstance
with
the
help
of
which
the
witness
has
made
his
association
thomas
hobbes
tells
the
story
of
an
association
which
involved
a
leap
from
the
british
civil
war
to
the
value
of
a
denarius
under
the
emperor
tiberius
the
process
was
as
follows
king
charles
i
was
given
up
by
the
scotch
for
christ
was
sold
for
denarii
what
then
was
a
denarius
worth
in
order
to
pursue
the
thread
of
such
an
association
one
needs
anyway
only
a
definite
quantity
of
historical
knowledge
but
this
quantity
must
be
possessed
but
such
knowledge
is
a
knowledge
of
universal
things
that
anybody
may
have
while
the
personal
relations
and
purely
subjective
experiences
which
are
at
the
command
of
an
individual
are
quite
unknown
to
any
other
person
and
it
is
often
exceedingly
difficult
to
discover
them
the
case
is
simplest
when
one
tries
to
aid
the
memory
of
a
witness
in
order
to
make
him
place
single
dates
when
the
attempt
is
made
to
determine
some
time
and
the
witness
is
reminded
of
certain
events
that
occurred
during
the
time
in
question
in
order
to
assist
him
in
fixing
the
calendar
time
or
again
when
the
witness
is
brought
to
the
place
of
the
crime
and
the
individual
conditions
are
associated
with
the
local
situation
but
when
not
merely
single
dates
are
to
be
associated
when
complete
events
are
to
be
associated
a
profound
knowledge
of
the
situation
must
precede
otherwise
no
association
is
successful
or
merely
results
are
attained
the
difficulties
which
here
ensue
depend
actually
upon
the
really
enormous
quantity
of
knowledge
every
human
being
must
possess
in
making
use
of
his
senses
anything
that
a
man
has
learned
at
school
in
the
newspapers
we
know
approximately
but
we
have
no
knowledge
of
what
a
man
has
thought
out
for
himself
and
what
he
has
felt
in
his
localized
conditions
his
home
his
town
his
travels
his
relations
and
their
experiences
however
important
this
may
be
we
have
no
means
of
getting
hold
of
it
those
associations
which
have
physical
expression
are
of
importance
only
in
particular
cases
for
example
the
feeling
of
ants
all
over
the
body
when
you
think
that
you
have
been
near
an
anthill
or
the
feeling
of
physical
pain
on
hearing
the
description
of
wounds
it
is
exceedingly
funny
to
see
how
during
the
lectures
of
dermatologists
the
whole
audience
scratches
that
part
of
the
body
which
is
troubling
the
patient
who
is
being
described
such
associations
may
be
legally
valuable
in
so
far
as
the
accused
who
plead
innocence
make
unconscious
movements
which
imply
the
denied
wounds
in
any
event
it
is
necessary
to
be
cautious
because
frequently
the
merely
accurate
description
of
a
wound
may
bring
about
the
same
effect
in
nervous
persons
as
the
sight
of
that
wound
if
however
the
wound
is
not
described
and
even
its
place
not
mentioned
and
only
the
general
harm
is
spoken
of
then
if
the
accused
reaches
for
that
part
of
his
body
in
which
the
wound
of
his
victim
is
located
you
have
a
clew
and
your
attention
should
be
directed
upon
it
such
an
index
is
worth
no
more
but
even
as
a
clew
it
has
some
value
all
in
all
we
may
say
that
the
legally
significant
direction
of
association
falls
in
the
same
class
with
an
we
need
association
for
the
purpose
of
constructing
an
image
and
an
explanation
of
the
event
in
question
something
must
to
we
must
an
idea
if
we
are
to
know
how
something
happened
we
need
association
moreover
in
order
to
discover
that
something
has
occurred
to
the
witness
an
or
is
essentially
one
and
the
same
in
all
its
forms
we
have
only
to
study
its
several
manifestations
occurrence
by
means
of
which
the
correct
thing
may
possibly
be
discovered
in
the
way
of
combining
inferring
comparing
and
testing
here
the
association
must
be
intentional
and
such
ideas
must
be
brought
to
a
fixed
image
which
may
be
in
such
wise
associated
with
them
as
to
make
a
result
possible
suppose
that
the
case
is
one
of
arson
and
the
criminal
is
unknown
then
we
will
require
the
plaintiff
to
make
local
temporal
identifying
and
contrasting
associations
with
the
idea
of
all
and
each
of
his
enemies
or
of
discharged
servants
beggars
etc
in
this
wise
we
can
attain
to
other
ideas
which
may
help
us
to
approach
some
definite
theory
in
which
a
thought
appears
with
apparent
suddenness
for
no
particular
reason
as
a
matter
of
fact
such
suddenness
is
always
caused
by
some
conscious
and
in
most
cases
some
unconscious
association
the
thread
of
which
can
not
be
later
sought
out
and
exhibited
because
of
its
being
subconscious
or
of
its
being
overleaped
so
quickly
and
readily
that
it
can
not
be
traced
very
often
some
particular
exercises
an
influence
which
unites
simultaneous
ideas
now
here
again
united
suppose
once
during
some
extraordinary
sound
the
ringing
of
a
bell
which
i
do
not
often
hear
i
had
seen
somebody
now
when
i
hear
that
bell
ringing
i
will
think
of
the
person
without
perhaps
knowing
the
definite
association
the
connection
of
the
man
with
the
tone
of
the
bell
occurs
unconsciously
this
may
go
still
further
that
man
when
i
first
saw
him
might
have
worn
perhaps
a
red
necktie
let
us
say
it
may
now
happen
that
every
time
i
hear
that
i
think
of
a
field
of
now
who
can
pursue
this
road
of
association
occurrence
in
which
in
the
process
of
the
longest
possible
calm
retention
of
an
idea
another
appears
of
itself
and
associates
with
the
first
i
meet
a
man
who
greets
me
although
i
do
not
recognize
him
i
may
perhaps
know
who
he
is
but
i
do
not
spontaneously
think
of
it
and
can
not
get
at
his
identity
constructively
because
of
lack
of
material
i
therefore
expect
something
from
this
and
with
my
eyes
shut
i
try
as
long
as
possible
to
keep
in
mind
the
idea
of
this
man
suddenly
i
see
him
before
me
with
serious
face
and
folded
hands
on
his
right
a
similar
individual
and
a
similar
one
on
his
left
above
them
a
high
window
with
a
curtain
the
man
was
a
juryman
who
sat
opposite
me
but
the
memory
is
not
exhausted
with
this
i
aim
to
banish
his
image
as
seated
and
keep
him
again
before
my
eyes
i
see
an
apparent
gate
beyond
him
with
shelves
behind
it
is
the
image
of
a
in
a
small
town
who
is
standing
before
the
door
of
his
shop
i
hold
this
image
straining
before
my
eyes
suddenly
a
wagon
appears
with
just
that
kind
of
trapping
which
i
have
only
once
seen
to
deck
the
equipage
of
a
i
know
well
who
this
is
what
the
little
town
near
his
estate
is
called
and
now
i
suddenly
know
that
the
man
whose
name
i
want
to
remember
is
the
merchant
x
of
y
who
once
was
a
juryman
in
my
court
this
means
of
the
longest
possible
retention
of
an
idea
i
have
made
frequent
use
of
with
the
more
intelligent
witnesses
it
rarely
succeeds
with
women
because
they
are
restless
and
all
in
all
with
surprising
effects
occurrence
which
consists
of
the
development
of
associations
backward
do
what
i
will
i
can
not
remember
the
name
of
a
certain
man
but
i
know
that
he
has
a
title
to
nobility
which
is
identical
with
the
name
of
a
small
town
in
obertfalz
finally
the
name
of
the
town
hirschau
occurs
to
me
and
now
i
easily
associate
backwards
von
it
is
of
course
natural
that
words
should
unroll
themselves
forwards
with
habitual
ease
but
backwards
only
when
we
think
of
the
word
we
are
trying
to
remember
as
written
and
then
associate
the
whole
as
a
image
this
is
unhappily
difficult
to
use
in
helping
another
topic
recollection
and
memory
section
in
direct
connection
with
the
association
of
ideas
is
our
recollection
and
memory
which
are
only
next
to
perception
in
legal
importance
in
the
knowledge
of
the
witness
whether
the
witness
wants
to
tell
the
truth
is
of
course
a
question
which
depends
upon
other
matters
but
whether
he
can
tell
the
truth
depends
upon
perception
and
memory
now
the
latter
is
a
highly
complicated
and
variously
organized
function
which
is
difficult
to
understand
even
in
the
daily
life
and
much
more
so
when
everything
depends
upon
whether
the
witness
has
noticed
anything
how
how
long
what
part
of
the
impression
has
sunk
more
deeply
into
his
mind
and
in
what
direction
his
defects
of
memory
are
to
be
sought
it
would
be
inexcusable
in
the
lawyer
not
to
think
about
this
and
to
make
equivalent
use
of
all
the
phenomena
that
are
presented
to
him
to
overlook
the
rich
literature
and
enormous
work
that
has
been
devoted
to
this
subject
is
to
raise
involuntarily
the
question
for
whom
was
it
all
done
nobody
needs
a
knowledge
of
the
essence
of
memory
more
than
the
lawyer
i
advise
every
criminalist
to
study
the
literature
of

a
the
essence
of

our
ignorance
concerning
memory
is
as
great
as
its
universal
importance
and
as
our
indebtedness
to
it
for
what
we
are
and

fichte
says
spirit
does
not
conserve
its

the
single
ideas
volitions
and

are
conserved
by
the
mind
and
constitute
the
ground
of
its
inexhaustibly
retentive

of

if
you

smooth

then

on

it
is
the
opinion
of

and
are
conscious
of
again
does
not
endure

but
as
echo

reid
asserts
that
memory
does
not
have
present
ideas
but
past
things
for
its
object
natorp
explains
recollection
as
an
identification
of
the
unidentical
of
with
now
according
to
herbart
and
his
school
memory
consists
in
the
possibility
of
recognizing
the
molecular
arrangements
which
had
been
left
by
past
impressions
in
the
ganglion
cells
and
in
reading
them
in
identical
fashion
according
to
wundt
and
his
pupils
the
problem
is
one
of
the
disposition
of
the
central
organs
and
it
is
the
opinion
of
james
mill
that
the
content
of
recollection
is
not
only
the
idea
of
the
remembered
object
but
also
the
idea
that
the
object
had
been
experienced
before
both
ideas
together
constitute
the
whole
of
that
state
of
mind
which
we
denote
as
memory
spinoza
deals
freely
with
memory
and
asserts
that
mankind
does
not
control
it
inasmuch
as
all
thoughts
ideas
resolutions
of
spirits
are
bare
results
of
memories
so
that
human
freedom
is
excluded
uphues
distinguishes
between
memory
and
the
conception
which
is
presupposed
in
the
recognition
of
an
object
different
from
that
conception
this
is
the
theory
developed
by
aristotle
according
to
berkeley
and
hume
recognition
is
not
directed
upon
a
different
object
nor
does
it
presuppose
one
the
activity
of
recognition
consists
either
in
the
exhibition
or
the
creation
of
the
object
recognition
lends
the
idea
an
independence
which
does
not
belong
to
it
and
in
that
way
turns
it
into
a
thing
objectifies
it
and
posits
it
as
substantial
maudsley
makes
use
of
the
notion
that
it
is
possible
to
represent
any
former
content
of
consciousness
as
attended
to
so
that
it
may
again
come
into
the
center
of
the
field
of
consciousness
dorner
explains
recognition
as
follows
possible
is
not
only
the
merely
possible
in
opposition
to
the
actual
it
is
much
more
proper
to
conceive
being
as
possible
as
amenable
to
logical
thinking
without
this
there

be
no
k√ºlpe
concerns
himself
with
the
problem
of
the
difference
between
perceptive
images
and
memory
images
and
whether
the
latter
are
only
weaker
than
the
former
as
english
philosophers
and
psychologists
assert
he
concludes
that
they
are
not
so
when
we
take
all
these
opinions
concerning
memory
together
we
conclude
that
neither
any
unity
nor
any
clear
description
of
the
matter
has
been
attained
sober
statement
may
certainly
be
correct
knowledge
of
memory
rises
almost
exclusively
from
the
observation
of
extreme
especially
striking
cases
whenever
we
ask
about
more
special
solutions
concerning
the
detail
of
what
has
been
counted
up
and
their
other
relations
of
dependence
their
structure
there
are
no
nobody
has
as
yet
paid
attention
to
the
simple
daily
events
which
constitute
the
routine
of
the
criminalists
we
find
little
instruction
concerning
them
and
our
difficulties
as
well
as
our
mistakes
are
thereby
increased
even
the
modern
repeatedly
cited
experimental
investigations
have
no
direct
bearing
upon
our
work
we
will
content
ourselves
with
viewing
the
individual
conceptions
of
memory
and
recollection
as
occurring
in
particular
cases
and
with
considering
them
now
one
now
the
other
according
to
the
requirements
of
the
case
we
shall
consider
the
general
relation
of
to
memory
we
shall
consider
in
a
general
sense
and
shall
subsume
under
it
also
the
involuntary
reproductions
which
rise
in
the
forms
and
qualities
of
past
events
without
being
evoked
which
rise
with
the
help
of
unconscious
activity
through
the
more
or
less
independent
association
of
ideas
exactly
this
unconscious
reproduction
this
apparently
involuntary
activity
is
perhaps
the
most
fruitful
and
we
therefore
unjustly
meet
with
unexceptionable
distrust
the
later
sudden
especially
when
these
occurrences
happen
to
defendant
and
his
witnesses
it
is
true
that
they
frequently
deceive
us
because
behind
the
sudden
occurrence
there
often
may
be
nothing
more
than
a
better
training
and
instruction
from
experienced
though
very
often
the
circumstances
are
such
that
the
suspect
has
succeeded
through
some
released
prisoner
or
by
a
blackened
letter
in
sending
a
message
from
his
prison
by
means
of
which
false
witnesses
of
alibi
are
provided
distrust
is
in
any
event
justified
when
his
most
important
witnesses
suddenly
to
the
accused
but
this
does
not
always
happen
and
we
find
in
our
own
experience
evidence
of
the
fact
that
memory
and
the
capacity
to
recall
something
often
depend
upon
health
feeling
location
and
chance
associations
which
can
not
be
commanded
and
happen
as
accidentally
as
anything
in
life
can
that
we
should
remember
anything
at
all
depends
upon
the
point
of
time
everybody
knows
how
important
twilight
may
be
for
memory
indeed
twilight
has
been
called
the
of
recollection
and
it
is
always
worth
while
to
observe
the
situation
when
anybody
asserts
that
some
matter
of
importance
occurred
to
him
in
the
twilight
such
an
assertion
merits
at
least
further
examination
now
if
we
only
know
how
these
occurrences
constitute
themselves
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
study
them
out
and
to
estimate
their
probability
but
we
do
not
know
and
we
have
to
depend
primarily
on
observation
and
test
not
one
of
the
theories
applied
is
supported
by
experience
altogether
they
may
be
divided
into
three
essential
groups
what
is
received
fades
away
becomes
a
and
is
more
or
less
overlaid
by
new
perceptions
when
these
latter
are
ever
set
aside
the
old
trace
comes
into
the
foreground
the
ideas
sink
darken
and
disintegrate
if
they
receive
support
and
intensification
they
regain
complete
clearness
the
ideas
crumble
up
lose
their
parts
when
anything
occurs
that
reunites
them
and
restores
what
is
lost
they
become
whole
again
ebbinghaus
maintains
correctly
enough
that
not
one
of
these
explanations
is
universally
satisfactory
but
it
must
be
granted
that
now
one
now
another
is
useful
in
controlling
this
or
that
particular
case
the
processes
of
the
destruction
of
an
idea
may
be
as
various
as
those
of
the
destruction
and
restoration
of
a
building
if
a
building
is
destroyed
by
fire
i
certainly
can
not
explain
the
image
given
by
merely
assuming
that
it
was
the
victim
of
the
hunger
of
time
a
building
which
has
suffered
because
of
the
sinking
of
the
earth
i
shall
have
to
image
by
quite
other
means
than
those
i
would
use
if
it
had
been
destroyed
by
water
for
the
same
reason
when
in
court
somebody
asserts
a
sudden
or
when
we
want
to
help
him
and
something
occurs
to
him
we
shall
have
to
proceed
in
different
fashion
and
determine
our
action
empirically
by
the
conditions
of
the
moment
we
shall
have
to
go
back
with
the
help
of
the
witness
to
the
beginning
of
the
appearance
of
the
idea
in
question
and
study
its
development
as
far
as
the
material
permits
us
in
a
similar
manner
we
must
make
use
of
every
possibility
of
explanation
when
we
are
studying
the
disappearance
of
ideas
at
one
point
or
another
we
shall
find
certain
connections
one
chief
mistake
in
such
reconstructive
work
lies
in
overlooking
the
fact
that
no
individual
is
merely
passive
when
he
receives
sensations
he
is
bound
to
make
use
of
a
certain
degree
of
activity
locke
and
bonnet
have
already
mentioned
this
fact
and
anybody
may
verify
it
by
comparing
his
experiments
of
trying
to
avoid
seeing
or
hearing
and
trying
actively
to
see
or
to
hear
for
this
reason
it
is
foolish
to
ask
anybody
how
it
happened
that
he
perceived
less
than
another
because
both
have
equally
good
senses
and
were
able
to
perceive
as
much
on
the
other
hand
the
grade
of
activity
each
has
made
use
of
in
perception
is
rarely
inquired
into
and
this
is
the
more
unfortunate
because
memory
is
often
proportionate
to
activity
if
then
we
are
to
explain
how
various
statements
concerning
contemporaneous
matters
observed
a
long
time
ago
are
to
be
combined
it
will
not
be
enough
to
compare
the
memory
sensory
acuteness
and
intelligence
of
the
witnesses
the
chief
point
of
attention
should
be
the
activity
which
has
been
put
in
motion
during
the
in
question
section
b
the
forms
of
reproduction
kant
analyzes
memory
as
apprehending
something
in
memory
as
retaining
it
for
a
long
time
as
immediately
recalling
it
one
might
perhaps
add
as
that
the
is
most
conformable
to
the
actual
one
this
is
not
identical
with
the
fact
that
we
recollect
at
all
it
is
to
be
assumed
that
the
forms
of
vary
very
much
with
different
persons
because
each
individual
verifies
his
images
of
various
objects
variously
i
know
two
men
equally
well
for
an
equal
time
and
yet
have
two
of
them
when
i
recall
one
a
moving
and
moved
figure
appears
before
me
even
the
very
man
himself
when
i
think
of
the
other
i
see
only
a
small
bare
silhouette
foggy
and
colorless
and
the
difference
does
not
require
that
the
first
shall
be
an
interesting
and
the
second
a
boresome
individual
this
is
still
clearer
in
memory
of
travels
one
city
appears
in
recollection
with
size
color
and
movement
real
the
other
in
which
i
sojourned
for
the
same
length
of
time
and
only
a
few
days
later
under
similar
conditions
of
weather
appears
like
a
small
flat
photograph
inquiry
reveals
that
this
is
as
true
of
other
people
as
of
me
and
that
the
problem
of
memory
is
much
differentiated
by
the
method
of
recollection
in
fact
this
is
so
little
in
doubt
that
at
some
periods
of
time
there
are
more
images
of
one
sort
than
of
another
and
what
is
a
rule
for
one
kind
of
individual
is
an
exception
for
another
now
there
is
a
series
of
phenomena
for
which
we
possess
particular
types
of
images
which
often
have
little
to
do
with
the
things
themselves
so
exner
says
might
know
the
physiognomy
of
an
individual
very
accurately
be
able
to
pick
him
out
among
a
thousand
without
being
clear
about
the
differences
between
him
and
another
indeed
we
often
do
not
know
the
color
of
his
eyes
and
hair
yet
marvel
when
it
suddenly
becomes
kries
calls
attention
to
another
fact
we
try
to
mark
in
memory
the
contour
of
a
very
coin
we
deceive
ourselves
unbelievably
when
we
see
the
coin
the
size
we
imagine
it
to
be
we
wonder
still
lotze
shows
correctly
that
memory
never
brings
back
a
blinding
flash
of
light
or
the
blow
of
an
explosion
with
the
intensity
of
the
image
in
proper
relation
to
the
impression
i
believe
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
so
far
for
example
and
hold
that
not
even
the
sparkling
of
a
star
the
crack
of
a
pistol
are
kept
in
memory
with
more
than
partial
implication
of
the
event
maudsley
points
out
correctly
that
we
can
have
no
memory
of
pain
the
disturbance
of
nervous
elements
disappears
just
as
soon
as
their
integrity
is
again
perhaps
also
because
when
the
pain
has
disappeared
the
tertium
comparationis
is
lacking
but
one
need
not
limit
oneself
to
pain
but
may
assert
that
we
lack
memory
of
all
unpleasant
sensations
the
first
time
one
jumps
into
the
water
from
a
very
high
the
first
time
horse
rises
over
a
hurdle
or
the
first
time
the
bullets
whistle
past
ear
in
battle
are
all
most
unpleasant
experiences
and
whoever
denies
it
is
deceiving
himself
or
his
friends
but
when
we
think
of
them
we
feel
that
they
were
not
so
bad
that
one
merely
was
very
much
afraid
etc
but
this
is
not
the
case
there
is
simply
no
memory
for
these
sensations
this
fact
is
of
immense
importance
in
examination
and
i
believe
that
no
witness
has
been
able
effectively
to
describe
the
pain
caused
by
a
body
wound
the
fear
roused
by
arson
the
fright
at
a
threat
not
indeed
because
he
lacked
the
words
to
do
so
but
because
he
had
not
sufficient
memory
for
these
impressions
and
because
he
has
nothing
with
which
to
compare
them
time
naturally
in
such
cases
makes
a
great
difference
and
if
a
man
were
to
describe
his
experiences
shortly
after
their
uncomfortable
occurrence
he
would
possibly
remember
them
better
than
he
would
later
on
here
if
the
examiner
has
experienced
something
similar
years
ago
he
is
likely
to
accuse
the
witness
of
exaggeration
under
the
belief
that
his
own
experience
has
shown
the
thing
to
be
not
so
bad
such
an
accusation
will
be
unjust
in
most
instances
the
differences
in
conception
depend
to
a
large
degree
on
differences
in
time
and
consequent
fading
in
memory
several
other
particular
conditions
may
be
added
kant
calls
attention
to
the
power
we
have
over
our
fancy
memory
our
will
must
control
our
imagination
and
our
imagination
must
be
able
to
determine
voluntarily
the
reproduction
of
ideas
of
past
but
these
ideas
may
be
brought
up
not
only
voluntarily
we
have
also
a
certain
degree
of
power
in
making
these
images
clearer
and
more
accurate
it
is
rather
foolish
to
have
the
examiner
invite
the
witness
to
his
memory
to
give
himself
the
trouble
this
effects
nothing
or
something
wrong
but
if
the
examiner
is
willing
to
take
the
trouble
he
may
excite
the
imagination
of
the
witness
and
give
him
the
opportunity
to
exercise
his
power
over
the
imagination
how
this
is
done
depends
naturally
upon
the
nature
and
education
of
the
witness
but
the
judge
may
aid
him
just
as
the
skilful
teacher
may
aid
the
puzzled
pupil
to
remember
when
the
pianist
has
completely
forgotten
a
piece
of
music
that
he
knew
very
well
two
or
three
chords
may
lead
him
to
explicate
these
chords
forward
or
backward
and
then
one
step
after
another
he
reproduces
the
whole
piece
of
course
the
chords
which
are
brought
to
the
mind
of
the
player
must
be
properly
chosen
or
the
procedure
is
useless

selection
of

content
of

due
to
discoverable
causes
melodies
may
become
painful
because
of
their
undesirable
obstinacy
in
return
forms
and
colors
do
not
usually
recur
and
if
they
do
they
do
so
with
noticeable
claims
on
distinctness
and
certainty
past
emotional
conditions
are
reproduced
only
with
effort
in
comparatively
pallid
schemes
and
often
only
by
means
of
the
accompanying
we
may
follow
these
clews
in
some
directions
at
least
to
our
advantage
of
course
nobody
will
say
that
one
should
play
tunes
to
witnesses
in
order
to
make
them
remember
because
the
tunes
have
sunk
into
the
memory
with
such
undesirable
obstinacy
as
to
be
spurs
to
recollection
it
is
just
as
futile
to
operate
with
forms
and
colors
or
to
excite
emotional
conditions
but
what
has
been
said
leads
us
back
to
the
ancient
rule
of
working
so
far
as
is
possible
with
the
constantly
sense
of
location
cicero
already
was
aware
of
this
vis
admonitionis
inest
in
locis
id
quidem
infinitum
in
hac
urbe
quocumque
enim
ingredimur
in
aliquam
historiam
vestigium
indeed
he
deduces
his
whole
doctrine
of
memory
from
the
sense
of
location
or
he
at
least
justifies
those
who
do
so
if
then
we
bring
a
witness
who
in
our
court
house
recollects
nothing
in
locum
rei
sitae
all
the
mentioned
conditions
act
favorably
the
most
influential
is
the
sense
of
location
itself
inasmuch
as
every
point
at
which
something
significant
occurred
not
only
is
the
content
of
an
association
but
is
also
the
occasion
of
one
it
is
moreover
to
be
remembered
that
reproduction
is
a
difficult
task
and
that
all
unnecessary
additional
difficulties
which
are
permitted
to
accrue
definitely
hinder
it
here
too
there
is
only
a
definite
number
of
units
of
psychical
energy
for
use
and
the
number
which
must
be
used
for
other
matters
is
lost
to
the
principal
task
if
i
recall
an
event
which
had
occurred
near
the
window
of
a
definite
house
i
should
have
considerable
difficulty
to
recall
the
form
of
the
house
the
location
of
the
window
its
appearance
and
by
the
time
this
attempt
has
barely
begun
to
succeed
i
have
made
so
much
effort
that
there
is
not
sufficient
power
left
for
the
recollection
of
the
event
we
are
really
concerned
with
moreover
a
mistake
in
the
recollection
of
extraneous
objects
and
the
false
associations
thereby
caused
may
be
very
disturbing
to
the
correctness
of
the
memory
of
the
chief
thing
if
however
i
am
on
the
spot
if
i
can
see
everything
that
i
had
seen
at
the
time
in
question
all
these
difficulties
are
disposed
of
we
have
still
to
count
in
the
other
conditions
mentioned
above
if
acoustic
effects
can
appear
anywhere
they
can
appear
in
the
locality
where
they
first
occurred
the
same
bell
ringing
or
a
similar
noise
may
occur
accidentally
the
murmur
of
the
brook
is
the
same
the
rustle
of
the
wind
determined
by
local
topography
vegetation
especially
by
trees
again
by
buildings
varies
with
the
place
and
even
if
only
a
fine
ear
can
indicate
what
the
difference
consists
of
every
normal
individual
senses
that
difference
unconsciously
even
the
noise
which
is
to
be
found
everywhere
will
be
differentiated
and
characteristic
according
to
locality
and
that
together
with
all
these
other
things
is
extraordinarily
favorable
to
the
association
of
ideas
and
the
reproduction
of
the
past
colors
and
forms
are
the
same
similar
orders
may
occur
and
possibly
the
same
attitudes
are
awakened
since
these
depend
in
so
great
degree
upon
external
conditions
now
once
these
with
their
retrospective
tendencies
are
given
the
recollection
of
any
contemporary
event
increases
as
one
might
say
spontaneously
whatever
may
especially
occur
to
aid
the
memory
of
an
event
occurs
best
at
the
place
where
the
event
itself
happened
and
hence
one
can
not
too
insistently
advise
the
examination
of
witnesses
in
important
cases
only
in
loco
rei
sitae
incidentally
the
judge
himself
learns
the
real
situation
and
saves
himself
thereby
much
time
and
effort
for
he
is
enabled
in
a
few
words
to
render
the
circumstantial
descriptions
which
have
to
be
composed
with
so
much
difficulty
when
the
things
are
not
seen
and
must
be
derived
from
the
testimonies
of
the
witnesses
themselves
whoever
does
not
believe
in
the
importance
of
conducting
the
examination
at
the
place
of
an
event
needs
only
to
repeat
his
examination
twice
once
at
the
court
and
again
at
the
place
then
he
certainly
will
doubt
no
more
of
course
the
thing
should
not
be
so
done
that
the
event
should
be
discussed
with
the
witness
at
the
place
of
its
occurrence
and
then
the
protocol
written
in
the
house
of
the
mayor
or
in
an
inn
half
an
hour
away
the
protocol
must
to
the
very
last
stroke
of
the
pen
be
written
then
and
there
in
order
that
every
impression
may
be
renewed
and
every
smallest
doubt
studied
and
corrected
then
the
differences
between
what
has
passed
what
has
been
later
added
and
what
is
found
can
be
easily
determined
by
sticking
to
the
rule
of
uphues
that
the
recognition
of
the
present
as
present
is
always
necessary
for
the
eventual
recognition
of
the
past
kant
has
already
suggested
what
surprising
results
such
an
examination
will
give
are
many
ideas
which
we
shall
never
again
in
our
lives
be
conscious
of
unless
some
occasion
cause
them
to
spring
up
in
the
but
such
a
particularly
powerful
occasion
is
locality
inasmuch
as
it
brings
into
play
all
the
influences
which
our
senses
are
capable
of
responding
to
of
course
the
possibility
of
memory
disappears
like
all
memory
with
the
lapse
of
time
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
know
that
those
of
our
experiences
which
concern
particular
persons
and
things
and
which
are
recalled
at
the
sight
of
those
persons
and
things
become
later
on
when
the
connections
of
images
have
been
broken
capable
only
of
awakening
general
notions
even
though
the
persons
or
things
are
as
absolutely
present
as
before
but
very
unfavorable
circumstances
must
have
been
at
work
before
such
a
situation
can
develop
it
is
characteristic
as
is
popularly
known
that
memory
can
be
intensified
by
means
of
special
occasions
it
is
opinion
that
the
spartan
boys
were
whipped
at
the
boundary
stones
of
their
country
in
order
that
they
might
recall
their
position
and
even
our
peasants
have
the
custom
when
setting
up
new
boundary
stones
of
grasping
small
boys
by
the
ears
and
hair
in
order
that
they
shall
the
better
remember
the
position
of
the
new
boundary
mark
when
as
grown
men
they
will
be
questioned
about
it
this
being
the
case
it
is
safer
to
believe
a
witness
when
he
can
demonstrate
some
intensely
influential
event
which
was
contemporaneous
with
the
situation
under
discussion
and
which
reminds
him
of
that
situation
section
c
the
peculiarities
of
reproduction
the
differences
in
memory
which
men
exhibit
are
not
among
their
other
human
qualities
the
least
as
is
well
known
this
difference
is
expressed
not
only
in
the
vigor
reliability
and
promptness
of
their
memory
but
also
in
the
field
of
memory
in
the
accompaniment
of
rapid
prehensivity
by
rapid
forgetfulness
or
slow
prehensivity
and
slow
forgetfulness
or
in
the
contrast
between
narrow
but
intense
memory
and
broad
but
approximate
memory
certain
special
considerations
arise
with
regard
to
the
field
of
greatest
memory
as
a
rule
it
may
be
presupposed
that
a
memory
which
has
developed
with
especial
vigor
in
one
direction
has
generally
done
this
at
the
cost
of
memory
in
another
direction
thus
as
a
rule

for
numbers
and
memory
for
names

other

bad

name
and
i
was
his
own
son
frequently
he
had
to
repeat
the
names
of
his
four
brothers
until
he
hit
upon
mine
and
that
was
not
always
a
successful
way
when
he
undertook
an
introduction
it
was
always
honored
m
m
m
dear
friend
of
my
youth
m
m
on
the
other
hand
his
memory
for
figures
was
astounding
he
noted
and
remembered
not
only
figures
that
interested
him
for
one
reason
or
another
but
also
those
that
had
not
the
slightest
connection
with
him
and
that
he
had
read
merely
by
accident
he
could
recall
instantaneously
the
population
of
countries
and
cities
and
i
remember
that
once
in
the
course
of
an
accidental
conversation
he
mentioned
the
production
of
beetroot
in
a
certain
country
for
the
last
ten
years
or
the
factory
number
of
my
watch
that
he
had
given
me
fifteen
years
before
and
had
never
since
held
in
his
hand
he
often
said
that
the
figures
he
carried
in
his
head
troubled
him
in
this
regard
the
symptom
may
be
mentioned
that
he
was
not
a
good
mathematician
but
so
exceptional
a
card
player
that
nobody
wanted
to
play
with
him
he
noticed
every
single
card
dealt
and
could
immediately
calculate
what
cards
each
player
had
and
was
able
to
say
at
the
beginning
of
the
game
how
many
points
each
must
have
such
various
developments
are
numerous
and
of
importance
for
us
because
we
frequently
are
unwilling
to
believe
the
witness
testifying
in
a
certain
field
for
the
reason
that
his
memory
in
another
field
had
shown
itself
to
be
unreliable
schubert
and
drobisch
cite
examples
of
this
sort
of
thing
but
the
observations
of
moderns
like
charcot
and
binet
concerning
certain
lightning
calculators
inaudi
diamandi
etc
confirm
the
fact
that
the
memory
for
figures
is
developed
at
the
expense
of
other
matters
linn√©
tells
that
lapps
who
otherwise
note
nothing
whatever
are
able
to
recognize
individually
each
one
of
their
numberless
reindeer
again
the
dutch
friend
of
flowers
voorhelm
had
a
memory
only
for
tulips
but
this
was
so
great
that
he
could
recognize
twelve
hundred
species
of
tulips
merely
from
the
dry
bulbs
these
fields
seem
to
be
of
a
remarkably
narrow
extent
besides
specialists
numismatists
zoologists
botanists
heralds
etc
who
apart
from
their
stupendous
memory
for
their
particular
matters
appear
to
have
no
memory
for
other
things
there
are
people
who
can
remember
only
rhymes
melodies
shapes
forms
titles
modes
service
relationships
etc
volkmar
has
devoted
some
space
to
showing
this
he
has
also
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
have
an
astounding
memory
for
certain
things
this
has
been
confirmed
by
other
students
one
of
them
du
potet
who
is
perhaps
the
expert
in
the
popular
mind
of
the
austrian
alps
has
made
it
especially
clear
as
in
all
mountainous
regions
there
are
a
great
number
of
those
unfortunate
idiots
who
when
fully
developed
are
called
cretins
and
in
their
milder
form
are
but
do
not
possess
intelligence
enough
to
earn
their
own
living
nevertheless
many
of
them
possess
astounding
memories
for
certain
things
one
of
them
is
thoroughly
conversant
with
the
weather
prophecy
in
the
calendar
for
the
past
and
the
present
year
and
can
cite
it
for
each
day
another
knows
the
day
and
the
history
of
every
saint
of
the
catholic
church
another
knows
the
boundaries
of
every
estate
and
the
name
of
its
owner
another
knows
each
particular
animal
in
a
collective
herd
of
cattle
knows
to
whom
it
belongs
etc
of
course
not
one
of
these
unfortunates
can
read
drobisch
mentions
an
idiotic
boy
not
altogether
able
to
speak
who
through
the
untiring
efforts
of
a
lady
succeeded
finally
in
learning
to
read
then
after
hasty
reading
of
any
piece
of
printed
matter
he
could
reproduce
what
he
had
read
word
for
word
even
when
the
book
had
been
one
in
a
foreign
and
unknown
tongue
another
author
mentions
a
cretin
who
could
tell
exactly
the
birthdays
and
of
the
inhabitants
of
his
town
for
a
decade
it
is
a
matter
of
experience
that
the
have
an
excellent
memory
and
can
accurately
reproduce
events
which
are
really
impressive
or
alarming
and
which
have
left
effects
upon
them
many
a
thing
which
normal
people
have
barely
noticed
or
which
they
have
set
aside
in
their
memory
and
have
forgotten
is
remembered
by
the
and
reproduced
on
the
contrary
the
latter
do
not
remember
things
which
normal
people
do
and
which
in
the
latter
frequently
have
a
disturbing
influence
on
the
important
point
they
may
be
considering
thus
the
may
be
able
to
describe
important
things
better
than
normal
people
as
a
rule
however
they
disintegrate
what
is
to
be
remembered
too
much
and
offer
too
little
to
make
any
effective
interpretation
possible
if
such
a
person
is
witness
of
a
shooting
he
notices
the
shot
only
and
gives
very
brief
attention
to
what
precedes
what
follows
or
what
is
otherwise
contemporary
until
his
examination
he
not
only
knows
nothing
about
it
but
even
doubts
its
occurrence
this
is
the
dangerous
element
in
his
testimony
generally
it
is
right
to
believe
his
kind
willingly
and
fools
tell
the
truth
what
they
say
bears
the
test
and
so
when
they
deny
an
event
there
is
a
tendency
to
overlook
the
fact
that
they
have
forgotten
a
great
deal
and
hence
to
believe
that
the
event
had
really
not
occurred
similar
experiences
are
yielded
in
the
case
of
the
memory
of
children
children
and
animals
live
only
in
the
present
because
they
have
no
historically
organic
ideas
in
mind
they
react
directly
upon
stimuli
without
any
disturbance
of
their
idea
of
the
past
this
is
valid
however
only
for
very
small
children
at
a
later
age
children
make
good
witnesses
and
a
boy
is
the
best
witness
in
the
world
we
have
only
to
keep
in
mind
that
later
events
tend
in
the
mind
to
wipe
out
earlier
ones
of
the
same
kind
it
used
to
be
said
that
children
and
nations
think
only
of
the
latest
events
and
that
is
universally
true
just
as
children
abandon
even
their
most
precious
toys
for
the
sake
of
a
new
one
so
they
tell
only
the
latest
events
in
their
experience
and
this
is
especially
the
case
when
there
are
a
great
many
facts
repeated
or
thefts
etc
children
will
tell
only
of
the
very
last
the
earlier
one
may
absolutely
have
disappeared
from
the
memory
bolton
who
has
made
a
systematic
study
of
the
memory
of
children
comes
to
the
familiar
conclusion
that
the
scope
of
memory
is
measured
by
the
capacity
of
concentrating
its
attention
memory
and
acute
intelligence
are
not
always
cognate
the
latter
proposition
true
not
for
children
alone
was
known
to
aristotle
as
a
rule
girls
have
better
memory
than
boys
it
might
also
be
said
that
their
intelligence
is
generally
greater
so
long
as
no
continuous
intellectual
work
and
especially
the
creation
of
own
ideas
is
required
of
figures
read
only
once
children
will
retain
a
maximum
of
six
adults
as
a
rule
also
retain
no
more
the
time
of
forgetting
in
general
has
been
excellently
schematized
by
ebbinghaus
he
studied
the
forgetting
of
a
series
of
thirteen
nonsense
syllables
previously
learned
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
able
to
measure
the
time
necessary
to
what
was
forgotten
at
the
end
of
an
hour
he
needed
half
the
original
time
at
the
end
of
eight
hours
of
that
time
then
the
process
of
loss
became
slower
at
the
end
of
hours
he
required
a
third
at
the
end
of
six
days
a
fourth
at
the
end
of
a
month
a
clear
fifth
of
the
time
required
at
first
i
have
tested
this
in
a
rough
way
on
various
and
numerous
persons
and
invariably
found
the
results
to
tally
of
course
the
measure
of
time
alters
with
the
memory
in
question
but
the
relations
remain
identical
so
that
one
may
say
approximately
how
much
may
be
known
of
any
subject
at
the
end
of
a
fixed
time
if
only
one
ratio
is
tested
to
criminalists
this
investigation
of
is
especially
recommended
the
conditions
of
prehensivity
of
particular
instances
are
too
uncertain
and
individual
to
permit
any
general
identifications
or
differentiations
there
are
certain
approximating
propositions
that
it
is
easier
to
keep
in
mind
rhymed
verse
than
prose
and
definite
rows
and
forms
than
block
masses
but
on
the
one
hand
what
is
here
involved
is
only
the
ease
of
memory
not
the
content
of
memory
and
on
the
other
hand
there
are
too
many
exceptions
there
are
many
people
who
retain
prose
better
than
verse
hence
it
is
not
worth
while
to
go
further
in
the
creation
of
such
rules
forty
or
fifty
years
ago
investigations
looking
toward
them
had
been
pursued
with
pleasure
and
they
are
recorded
in
the
journals
of
the
time
that
aged
persons
have
as
is
well
known
a
good
memory
for
what
is
long
past
and
a
poor
one
for
recent
occurrences
is
not
remarkable
it
is
to
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
age
seems
to
be
accompanied
with
a
decrease
of
energy
in
the
brain
so
that
it
no
longer
assimilates
influences
and
the
imagination
becomes
dark
and
the
judgment
of
facts
incorrect
hence
the
mistakes
are
those
of
apperception
of
new
things
what
has
already
been
perceived
is
not
influenced
by
this
loss
of
energy
again
it
should
not
rouse
astonishment
that
so
remarkable
and
delicately
organized
a
function
as
memory
should
be
subject
to
anomalies
and
abnormalities
of
all
kinds
we
must
take
it
as
a
rule
not
to
assume
the
impossibility
of
the
extraordinary
phenomena
that
appear
and
to
consult
the
expert
about
them
the
physician
will
explain
the
pathological
and
pathoformic
but
there
is
a
series
of
which
do
not
appear
to
be
diseased
yet
which
are
significantly
rare
and
hence
appear
improbable
such
forms
will
require
the
examination
of
an
experienced
expert
psychologist
who
even
when
unable
to
explain
the
particular
case
will
still
be
able
to
throw
some
light
on
it
from
the
literature
of
the
subject
this
literature
is
rich
in
examples
of
the
same
thing
they
have
been
eagerly
collected
and
scientifically
studied
in
the
earlier
psychological
investigations
modern
psychology
unfortunately
does
not
study
these
problems
and
in
any
event
its
task
is
so
enormous
that
the
practical
problems
of
memory
in
the
daily
life
must
be
set
aside
for
a
later
time
we
have
to
cite
only
a
few
cases
handled
in
literature
the
best
known
is
the
story
of
an
irish
servant
girl
who
during
fever
recited
hebrew
sentences
which
she
had
heard
from
a
preacher
when
a
child
another
case
tells
of
a
very
great
fool
who
during
fever
repeated
prolonged
conversations
with
his
master
so
that
the
latter
decided
to
make
him
his
secretary
but
when
the
servant
got
well
he
became
as
foolish
as
ever
the
criminalist
who
has
the
opportunity
of
examining
deeply
wounded
feverish
persons
makes
similar
though
not
such
remarkable
observations
these
people
give
him
the
impression
of
being
quite
intelligent
persons
who
tell
their
stories
accurately
and
correctly
later
on
after
they
are
cured
one
gets
a
different
opinion
of
their
intelligence
still
more
frequently
one
observes
that
these
feverish
wounded
victims
know
more
and
know
more
correctly
about
the
crime
than
they
are
able
to
tell
after
they
have
recovered
what
they
tell
moreover
is
quite
reliable
provided
of
course
they
are
not
delirious
or
crazy
the
cases
are
innumerable
in
which
people
have
lost
their
memory
for
a
short
time
or
for
ever
i
have
already
elsewhere
mentioned
an
event
which
happened
to
a
friend
of
mine
who
received
a
sudden
blow
on
the
head
while
in
the
mountains
and
completely
lost
all
memory
of
what
had
occurred
a
few
minutes
before
the
blow
after
this
citation
i
got
a
number
of
letters
from
my
colleagues
who
had
dealt
with
similar
cases
i
infer
therefore
that
the
instances
in
which
people
lose
their
memory
of
what
has
occurred
before
the
event
by
way
of
a
blow
on
the
head
are
numerous
legally
such
cases
are
important
because
we
would
not
believe
statements
in
that
regard
made
by
accused
inasmuch
as
there
seems
to
be
no
reason
why
the
events
the
wound
should
disappear
just
as
if
each
impression
needed
a
fixative
like
a
charcoal
drawing
but
as
this
phenomenon
is
described
by
the
most
reliable
persons
who
have
no
axe
to
grind
in
the
matter
we
must
believe
it
other
things
being
equal
even
when
the
defendant
asserts
it
that
such
cases
are
not
isolated
is
shown
in
the
fact
that
people
who
have
been
stunned
by
lightning
have
later
forgotten
everything
that
occurred
shortly
before
the
flash
the
case
is
similar
in
poisoning
with
gas
with
mushrooms
and
in
strangulation
the
latter
cases
are
especially
important
inasmuch
as
the
wounded
person
frequently
the
only
witness
has
nothing
to
say
about
the
event
i
can
not
omit
recalling
in
this
place
a
case
i
have
already
mentioned
elsewhere
that
of
brunner
in
in
the
town
of
dietkirchen
in
bavaria
the
teacher
two
children
were
murdered
and
his
wife
and
servant
girl
badly
wounded
after
some
time
the
woman
regained
consciousness
seemed
to
know
what
she
was
about
but
could
not
tell
the
investigating
justice
who
had
been
sent
on
to
take
charge
of
the
case
anything
whatever
concerning
the
event
the
criminal
etc
when
he
had
concluded
his
negative
protocol
she
signed
it
martha
guttenberger
instead
of
martha
brunner
fortunately
the
official
noted
this
and
wanted
to
know
what
relation
she
had
to
the
name
guttenberger
he
was
told
that
a
former
lover
of
the
servant
girl
an
fellow
was
called
by
that
name
he
was
traced
to
munich
and
there
arrested
he
immediately
confessed
to
the
crime
and
when
brunner
became
quite
well
she
recalled
accurately
that
she
had
definitely
recognized
guttenberger
as
the
murderer
the
psychological
process
was
clearly
one
in
which
the
idea
is
the
criminal
had
sunk
into
the
secondary
sphere
of
consciousness
the
subconsciousness
so
that
it
was
only
clear
to
the
real
consciousness
that
the
name
guttenberger
had
something
to
do
with
the
crime
the
woman
in
her
weakened
mental
condition
thought
she
had
already
sufficiently
indicated
this
fact
so
that
she
overlooked
the
name
and
hence
wrote
it
unconsciously
only
when
the
pressure
on
her
brain
was
reduced
did
the
idea
that
guttenberger
was
the
murderer
pass
from
the
subconscious
to
the
conscious
psychiatrists
explain
the
case
as
follows
the
thing
here
involved
is
retrograde
amnesia
it
is
nowadays
believed
that
this
phenomenon
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
occurs
according
to
the
rule
which
defines
traumatic
hysteria
as
ideogen
the
ideational
complexes
in
question
are
forced
into
the
subconsciousness
whence
on
occasion
by
aid
of
associative
processes
hypnotic
concentration
and
such
other
similar
elements
they
can
be
raised
into
consciousness
in
this
case
the
suppressed
ideational
complex
manifested
itself
in
signing
the
name
all
legal
medicine
discusses
the
fact
that
wounds
in
the
head
make
people
forget
single
words
taine
guerin
abercrombie
cite
many
examples
and
winslow
tells
of
a
woman
who
after
considerable
bleeding
forgot
all
her
french
the
story
is
also
told
that
henry
holland
had
so
tired
himself
that
he
forgot
german
when
he
grew
stronger
and
recovered
he
regained
all
he
had
forgotten
would
we
believe
a
prisoner
who
told
us
any
one
of
these
things
the
phenomena
of
memories
which
occur
in
dying
persons
who
have
long
forgotten
and
never
even
thought
of
these
memories
are
very
significant
english
psychologists
cite
the
case
of
dr
rush
who
had
in
his
lutheran
congregation
germans
and
swedes
who
prayed
in
their
own
language
shortly
before
death
although
they
had
not
used
it
for
fifty
or
sixty
years
i
can
not
prevent
myself
from
thinking
that
many
a
confession
has
something
to
do
with
this
phenomenon
at
the
boundary
between
incorrect
perception
and
forgetting
are
those
cases
in
which
under
great
excitement
important
events
do
not
reach
consciousness
i
believe
that
the
responsibility
is
here
to
be
borne
by
the
memory
rather
than
by
there
seems
to
be
no
reason
for
failing
to
perceive
with
the
senses
under
the
greatest
excitement
but
there
is
some
clearness
in
the
notion
that
great
excitement
causes
what
has
just
been
perceived
to
be
almost
immediately
forgotten
in
my
i
have
discussed
a
series
of
cases
of
this
sort
and
show
how
the
memory
might
come
into
play
none
of
the
witnesses
had
seen
that
mary
stuart
received
when
being
executed
two
blows
in
the
case
of
an
execution
of
many
years
ago
not
one
of
those
present
could
tell
me
the
color
of
the
gloves
of
the
executioner
although
everyone
had
noticed
the
gloves
in
a
train
wreck
a
soldier
asserted
that
he
had
seen
dozens
of
smashed
corpses
although
only
one
person
was
harmed
a
prison
warden
who
was
attacked
by
an
escaping
murderer
saw
in
the
hand
a
long
knife
which
turned
out
to
be
a
herring
when
carnot
was
murdered
neither
one
of
the
three
who
were
in
the
carriage
with
him
nor
the
two
saw
the
knife
or
the
delivery
of
the
blow
etc
how
often
may
we
make
mistakes
because
the
witnesses
in
their
excitement
have
forgotten
the
most
important
things
section
d
illusions
of
memory
memory
illusion
or
paramnesia
consists
in
the
illusory
opinion
of
having
experienced
seen
or
heard
something
although
there
has
been
no
such
experience
vision
or
sound
it
is
the
more
important
in
criminal
law
because
it
enters
unobtrusively
and
unnoticed
into
the
circle
of
observation
and
not
directly
by
means
of
a
demonstrated
mistake
hence
it
is
the
more
difficult
to
discover
and
has
a
disturbing
influence
which
makes
it
very
hard
to
perceive
the
mistakes
that
have
occurred
in
consequence
of
it
it
may
be
that
leibnitz
meant
paramnesia
with
his
later
lichtenberg
must
have
had
it
in
mind
when
he
repeatedly
asserted
that
he
must
have
been
in
the
world
once
before
inasmuch
as
many
things
seemed
to
him
so
familiar
although
at
the
time
he
had
not
yet
experienced
them
later
on
jessen
concerned
himself
with
the
question
and
sander
asserts
him
to
have
been
the
first
according
to
jessen
everybody
is
familiar
with
the
phenomenon
in
which
the
sudden
impression
occurs
that
what
is
experienced
has
already
been
met
with
before
so
that
the
future
might
be
predicted
langwieser
asserts
that
one
always
has
the
sensation
that
the
event
occurred
a
long
time
ago
and
karl
neuhoff
finds
that
his
sensation
is
accompanied
with
unrest
and
contraction
the
same
thing
is
discussed
by
many
other
authors
various
explanations
have
been
offered
wigand
and
maudsley
think
they
see
in
paramnesia
a
simultaneous
functioning
of
both
relations
anje
believes
that
illusory
memory
depends
on
the
differentiation
which
sometimes
occurs
between
perception
and
according
to
k√ºlpe
these
are
the
things
that
plato
interpreted
in
his
doctrine
of
sully
in
his
book
on
illusions
has
examined
the
problem
most
thoroughly
and
he
draws
simple
conclusions
he
finds
that
vivacious
children
often
think
they
have
experienced
what
is
told
them
this
however
is
retained
in
the
memory
of
the
adult
who
continues
to
think
that
he
has
actually
experienced
it
the
same
thing
is
true
when
children
have
intensely
desired
anything
thus
the
given
us
by
rousseau
goethe
and
de
quincey
must
come
from
the
airy
regions
of
the
dream
life
or
from
waking
revery
and
dickens
has
dealt
with
this
dream
life
in
sully
adds
that
we
also
generate
illusions
of
memory
when
we
assign
to
experiences
false
dates
and
believe
ourselves
to
have
felt
as
children
something
we
experienced
later
and
merely
set
back
into
our
childhood
so
again
he
reduces
much
supposed
to
have
been
heard
to
things
that
have
been
read
novels
may
make
such
an
impression
that
what
has
been
read
or
described
there
appears
to
have
been
really
experienced
a
name
or
region
then
seems
to
be
familiar
because
we
have
read
of
something
similar
it
will
perhaps
be
proper
not
to
reduce
all
the
phenomena
of
paramnesia
to
the
same
conditions
only
a
limited
number
of
them
seem
to
be
so
reducible
impressions
often
occur
which
one
is
inclined
to
attribute
to
illusory
memory
merely
to
discover
later
that
they
were
real
but
unconscious
memory
the
things
had
been
actually
experienced
and
the
events
had
been
forgotten
so
for
example
i
visit
some
region
for
the
first
time
and
get
the
impression
that
i
have
seen
it
before
and
since
this
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
not
the
case
i
believe
myself
to
have
suffered
from
an
illusion
of
memory
later
i
perceive
that
perhaps
in
early
childhood
i
had
really
been
in
a
country
that
resembled
this
one
thus
my
memory
was
really
correct
i
had
merely
forgotten
the
experience
to
which
it
referred
aside
from
these
unreal
illusions
of
memory
many
if
not
all
others
are
explicable
as
sully
indicates
by
the
fact
that
something
similar
to
what
has
been
experienced
has
been
read
or
heard
while
the
fact
that
it
has
been
read
or
heard
is
half
forgotten
or
has
sunk
into
the
subconsciousness
only
the
sensation
has
remained
not
the
recollection
that
it
was
read
etc
another
part
of
this
phenomenon
may
possibly
be
explained
by
vivid
dreams
which
also
leave
strong
impressions
without
leaving
the
memory
of
their
having
been
dreams
whoever
is
in
the
habit
of
dreaming
vividly
will
know
how
it
is
possible
to
have
for
days
a
clear
or
cloudy
feeling
of
the
discovery
of
something
excellent
or
disturbing
only
to
find
out
later
that
there
has
been
no
real
experience
only
a
dream
such
a
feeling
especially
the
memory
of
things
seen
or
heard
in
dreams
may
remain
in
consciousness
if
later
some
similar
matter
is
really
met
with
the
sensation
may
appear
as
a
past
event
this
is
all
the
easier
since
dreams
are
never
completely
rigid
but
easily
modeled
and
adaptable
so
that
if
there
is
the
slightest
approximation
to
similarity
memory
of
a
dream
lightly
attaches
itself
to
real
experience
all
this
may
happen
to
anybody
well
or
ill
nervous
or
stolid
indeed
kr√§pelin
asserts
that
paramnesia
occurs
only
under
normal
circumstances
it
may
also
be
generally
assumed
that
a
certain
fatigued
condition
of
the
mind
or
of
the
body
renders
this
occurrence
more
likely
if
it
does
not
altogether
determine
it
so
far
as
throws
any
light
on
the
matter
this
statement
appears
to
be
correct
i
had
such
illusions
of
memory
most
numerously
during
the
bosnian
war
of
occupation
of
when
we
made
our
terrible
forced
marches
from
esseg
to
sarajevo
the
illusions
appeared
regularly
after
dinner
when
we
were
quite
tired
then
the
region
which
all
my
preceding
life
i
had
not
seen
appeared
to
be
pleasantly
familiar
and
when
once
at
the
very
beginning
i
received
the
order
to
storm
a
village
occupied
by
turks
i
thought
it
would
not
be
much
trouble
i
had
done
it
so
frequently
and
nothing
had
ever
happened
at
that
time
we
were
quite
exhausted
even
when
we
had
entered
the
otherwise
empty
village
this
extraordinary
circumstance
did
not
impress
me
and
i
thought
that
the
inside
of
a
village
always
looked
like
that
although
i
had
never
before
seen
such
a
turkish
or
pictured
another
mode
of
explanation
may
be
mentioned
explanation
by
heredity
hering
and
sully
have
dealt
with
it
according
to
the
latter
especially
we
may
think
that
we
have
undergone
some
experience
that
really
belongs
to
some
ancestor
sully
believes
that
this
contention
can
not
be
genetically
contradicted
because
a
group
of
skilled
activities
hiding
from
the
enemy
migration
etc
have
been
indubitably
inherited
from
the
animals
but
on
the
other
hand
that
paramnesia
is
inherited
memory
can
be
proved
only
with
a
child
which
had
been
brought
up
far
from
the
sea
but
whose
parents
and
grandparents
had
been
if
that
child
should
at
first
sight
have
the
feeling
that
he
is
familiar
with
the
sea
the
inheritance
of
memory
would
be
proved
so
long
as
we
have
not
a
larger
number
of
such
instances
the
assumption
of
hereditary
influence
is
very
suggestive
but
only
probable
with
regard
to
the
bearing
of
on
criminal
cases
i
shall
cite
only
one
possible
instance
somebody
just
waking
from
sleep
has
perceived
that
his
servant
is
handling
his
purse
which
is
lying
on
the
and
in
consequence
of
the
he
believes
that
he
has
already
observed
this
many
times
before
the
action
of
the
servant
was
perhaps
harmless
and
in
no
way
directed
toward
theft
now
the
evidence
of
the
master
is
supposed
to
demonstrate
that
this
has
repeatedly
occurred
then
perhaps
no
doubt
arises
that
the
servant
has
committed
theft
frequently
and
has
had
the
intention
of
doing
so
this
time
to
generalize
this
situation
would
be
to
indicate
that
illusions
of
memory
are
always
likely
to
have
doubtful
results
when
they
have
occurred
only
once
and
when
the
witness
in
consequence
of
paramnesia
believes
the
event
to
have
been
repeatedly
observed
it
is
not
difficult
to
think
of
numbers
of
such
cases
but
it
will
hardly
be
possible
to
say
how
the
presence
of
illusions
of
memory
is
to
be
discovered
without
the
knowledge
they
exist
when
we
consider
all
the
qualities
and
idiosyncrasies
of
memory
this
so
varied
function
of
the
mind
we
must
wonder
that
its
estimation
in
special
cases
is
frequently
different
although
proceeding
from
a
second
person
or
from
the
very
owner
of
the
questionable
memory
sully
finds
rightly
that
one
of
the
keenest
tricks
in
fighting
convictions
is
to
attack
the
memory
of
another
with
regard
to
its
reliability
memory
is
the
private
domain
of
the
individual
from
the
secret
of
his
own
consciousness
into
which
no
other
may
enter
it
draws
all
its
values
the
case
is
altered
however
when
a
man
speaks
of
his
personal
memory
it
must
then
assume
all
the
deficiencies
which
belong
to
other
mental
powers
we
lawyers
especially
hear
frequently
from
witnesses
memory
is
too
weak
to
answer
this
question
receiving
the
wound
in
question
my
memory
has
failed
am
already
too
old
my
memory
is
leaving
me
etc
in
each
of
these
cases
however
it
is
not
the
memory
that
is
at
fault
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
witness
ought
to
have
said
am
too
stupid
to
answer
this
question
the
wound
in
question
my
intellectual
powers
have
failed
am
already
old
i
am
growing
silly
etc
but
of
course
no
one
will
save
very
rarely
underestimate
his
good
sense
and
it
is
more
comfortable
to
assign
its
deficiencies
to
the
memory
this
occurs
not
only
in
words
but
also
in
construction
if
a
man
has
incorrectly
reproduced
any
matter
whether
a
false
observation
or
a
deficient
combination
or
an
unskilled
interpretation
of
facts
he
will
not
blame
these
things
but
will
assign
the
fault
to
memory
if
he
is
believed
absolutely
incorrect
conclusions
may
result
section
e
mnemotechnique
just
a
few
words
concerning
mnemotechnique
mnemonic
and
anamnestic
the
discovery
of
some
means
of
helping
the
memory
has
long
been
a
human
purpose
from
simonides
of
chios
to
the
sophist
hippias
of
elis
experiments
have
been
made
in
artificial
development
of
the
memory
and
some
have
been
remarkably
successful
since
the
middle
ages
a
large
group
of
people
have
done
this
we
still
have
the
figures
of
the
valid
syllogisms
in
logic
like
barbara
etc
the
rules
for
remembering
in
the
latin
grammar
may
still
be
learned
with
advantage
the
books
of
kothe
and
others
have
in
their
day
created
not
a
little
discussion
as
a
rule
modern
psychology
pays
a
little
attention
to
memory
devices
in
a
certain
sense
nobody
can
avoid
mnemonic
for
whenever
you
tie
a
knot
in
your
handkerchief
or
stick
your
watch
into
your
pocket
upside
down
you
use
a
memory
device
again
whenever
you
want
to
bear
anything
in
mind
you
reduce
difficulties
and
bring
some
kind
of
order
into
what
you
are
trying
to
retain
thus
some
artificial
grip
on
the
object
is
applied
by
everybody
and
the
utility
and
reliability
of
this
grip
determines
the
trustworthiness
of
a
memory
this
fact
may
be
important
for
the
criminal
lawyer
in
two
ways
on
the
one
hand
it
may
help
to
clear
up
misunderstandings
when
false
mnemonic
has
been
applied
thus
once
somebody
called
an
aniline
dye
which
is
soluble
in
water
and
is
called
by
the
name
and
asked
for
it
under
that
name
in
the
store
in
order
to
aid
his
memory
he
had
associated
it
with
the
word
for
black
man
niger
negro
moor
and
thus
had
substituted
moor
for
nigro
in
the
construction
of
the
word
he
wanted
again
somebody
asked
for
the
or
the
the
request
was
due
to
the
fact
that
in
the
austrian
dialect
is
pronounced
like
salm
and
the
colloquial
for
is
to
wipe
ernst
lohsing
tells
me
that
he
was
once
informed
that
a
schnepfe
had
called
on
him
while
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
name
was
wachtel
such
misunderstandings
produced
by
false
mnemonic
may
easily
occur
during
the
examination
of
witnesses
they
are
of
profound
significance
if
once
you
suspect
that
false
memory
has
been
in
play
you
may
arrive
at
the
correct
idea
by
using
the
proper
synonyms
and
by
considering
words
if
attention
is
paid
to
the
determining
conditions
of
the
special
case
success
is
almost
inevitable
the
second
way
in
which
false
mnemotechnique
is
important
is
that
in
which
the
technique
was
correct
but
in
which
the
key
to
the
system
has
been
lost
the
witness
has
forgotten
how
he
proceeded
suppose
for
example
that
i
need
to
recall
the
relation
of
the
ages
of
three
people
to
each
other
now
if
i
observe
that
m
is
the
oldest
n
the
middle
one
and
o
the
youngest
i
may
suppose
in
order
to
help
my
memory
that
their
births
followed
in
the
same
order
as
their
initials
m
n
o
now
suppose
that
at
another
time
in
another
case
i
observe
the
same
relation
but
find
the
order
of
the
initials
reversed
o
n
if
now
in
the
face
of
the
facts
i
stop
simply
with
this
technique
i
may
later
on
substitute
the
two
cases
for
each
other
hence
when
a
witness
says
anything
which
appears
to
have
been
difficult
to
remember
it
is
necessary
to
ask
him
he
was
able
to
remember
it
if
he
assigns
some
aid
to
memory
as
the
reason
he
must
be
required
to
explain
it
and
he
must
not
be
believed
unless
it
is
found
reliable
if
the
witness
in
the
instance
above
for
example
says
never
make
use
of
converse
relations
then
his
testimony
will
seem
comparatively
trustworthy
and
it
is
not
difficult
to
judge
the
degree
of
reliability
of
any
aid
to
memory
whatever
great
liars
are
frequently
characterized
by
their
easy
use
of
the
most
complicated
mnemotechnique
they
know
how
much
they
need
it
topic
the
will
section
of
course
we
do
not
intend
to
discuss
here
either
the
of
the
philosopher
or
the
or
of
criminal
law
nor
yet
the
of
the
of
the
moralist
we
aim
only
to
consider
a
few
facts
that
may
be
of
significance
to
the
criminal
lawyer
hence
we
intend
by
only
what
is
currently
and
popularly
meant
i
take
will
to
be
the
inner
effect
of
the
more
powerful
impulses
while
action
is
the
effect
of
those
impulses
when
hartmann
says
that
will
is
the
transposition
of
the
ideal
into
the
real
he
sounds
foolish
but
in
one
sense
the
definition
is
excellent
you
need
only
understand
by
ideal
that
which
does
not
yet
exist
and
by
real
that
which
is
a
fact
and
actual
for
when
i
voluntarily
compel
myself
to
think
about
some
subject
something
has
actually
happened
but
this
event
is
not
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
that
word
we
are
to
bear
in
mind
however
that
locke
warned
us
against
the
contrast
between
intelligence
and
will
as
real
spiritual
essences
one
of
which
gives
orders
and
the
other
of
which
obeys
from
this
conception
many
fruitless
controversies
and
confusions
have
arisen
in
this
regard
we
criminalists
must
always
remember
how
often
the
common
work
of
will
and
intelligence
opposes
us
in
witnesses
and
still
more
so
in
defendants
causing
us
great
difficulties
when
the
latter
deny
their
crime
with
iron
fortitude
and
conceal
their
guilt
by
rage
or
when
for
months
they
act
out
most
difficult
parts
with
wonderful
energy
we
must
grant
that
they
exhibit
aspects
of
the
will
which
have
not
yet
been
studied
indeed
we
can
make
surprising
observations
of
how
effectively
prisoners
control
the
muscles
of
their
faces
which
are
least
controllable
by
the
will
the
influence
the
will
may
have
on
a
power
even
to
flush
and
grow
pale
is
also
more
extensive
than
may
be
established
scientifically
this
can
be
learned
from
quite
remote
events
my
son
happens
to
have
told
me
that
at
one
time
he
found
himself
growing
pale
with
cold
and
as
under
the
circumstance
he
was
afraid
of
being
accused
of
lacking
courage
to
pursue
his
task
he
tried
with
all
his
power
to
suppress
his
pallor
and
succeeded
perfectly
since
then
at
court
i
have
seen
a
rising
blush
or
beginning
pallor
suppressed
completely
yet
this
is
theoretically
impossible
but
the
will
is
also
significant
in
judging
the
man
as
a
whole
according
to
drobisch
the
abiding
qualities
and
ruling
of
a
volition
constitute
his
character
not
only
inclination
and
habits
and
guiding
principles
determine
the
character
but
also
meanings
prejudices
convictions
etc
of
all
kinds
since
then
we
can
not
avoid
studying
the
character
of
the
individual
we
must
trace
his
volitions
and
desires
this
in
itself
is
not
difficult
the
idea
of
his
character
develops
spontaneously
when
so
traced
but
the
will
contains
also
the
characteristic
signs
of
difference
which
are
important
for
our
purposes
we
are
enabled
to
work
intelligently
and
clearly
only
by
our
capacity
for
distinguishing
indifferent
from
criminal
and
logically
interpretable
deeds
nothing
makes
our
work
so
difficult
as
the
inconceivably
superfluous
mass
of
details
not
every
deed
or
activity
is
an
action
only
those
are
such
which
are
determined
by
will
and
knowledge
so
abegg
teaches
us
what
is
determined
by
means
of
the
will
may
be
discovered
by
analysis
of
course
we
must
find
the
proper
approach
to
this
subject
and
not
get
lost
in
the
quarrel
which
is
the
in
contemporary
criminal
law
forty
years
ago
renan
said
that
the
error
of
the
eighteenth
century
lay
generally
in
assigning
to
the
free
and
will
what
could
be
explained
by
means
of
the
natural
effects
of
human
powers
and
capacities
that
century
understood
too
little
the
theory
of
instinctive
activity
nobody
will
claim
that
in
the
transposition
of
willing
into
the
expression
of
human
capacity
the
question
of
determinism
is
solved
the
solution
of
this
question
is
not
our
task
we
do
get
an
opening
however
through
which
we
can
approach
the
criminal
not
by
having
to
examine
the
elusive
character
of
his
will
but
by
apprehending
the
intelligible
expression
of
his
capacity
the
weight
of
our
work
is
set
on
the
application
of
the
concept
of
causality
and
the
problem
of
stands
or
falls
with
that
in
his
of
the
knowledge
of
has
brought
some
clearness
into
this
problem
may
be
denied
pain
and
desire
may
not
the
appetite
which
is
the
stimulus
to
action
necessarily
precedes
the
problem
therefore
is
that
of
and
not
as
i
had
said
a
minute
ago
that
of
the
freedom
of
the
will
it
is
to
the
former
that
analytic
mechanics
may
be
and
the
study
of
is
just
what
we
lawyers
may
be
required
to
undertake
of
course
it
is
insufficient
merely
to
study
the
individual
manifestations
of
human
capacities
for
these
may
be
accidental
results
or
phenomena
determined
by
unknown
factors
our
task
consists
in
attaining
abstractions
in
accord
with
careful
and
conscientious
perceptions
and
in
finding
each
determining
occasion
in
its
particular
activities
according
to
drobisch
and
the
subjective
principles
of
evolution
are
as
kant
calls
them
laws
of
general
content
required
to
determine
our
own
volitions
and
actions
then
again
they
are
rules
of
our
own
volition
and
action
which
we
ourselves
construct
and
which
hence
are
subjectively
valid
when
these
maxims
determine
our
future
volitions
and
actions
they
are
we
may
therefore
say
that
we
know
a
man
when
we
know
his
will
and
that
we
know
his
will
when
we
know
his
maxims
by
means
of
his
maxims
we
are
able
to
judge
his
actions
but
we
must
not
reconstruct
his
maxims
theoretically
we
must
study
everything
that
surrounds
alters
and
determines
him
for
it
is
at
this
point
that
a
environments
and
relationships
most
influence
him
as
grohmann
said
half
a
century
ago
you
could
find
an
elixir
which
could
cause
the
vital
organs
to
work
otherwise
if
you
could
alter
the
somatic
functions
of
the
body
you
would
be
the
master
of
the
therefore
it
is
never
superfluous
to
study
the
environmental
conditions
surroundings
all
his
outer
influences
that
the
effort
required
in
such
a
study
is
great
is
of
course
obvious
but
the
criminal
lawyer
must
make
it
if
he
is
to
perform
his
task
properly
topic
emotion
section
little
as
emotion
as
generally
understood
may
have
to
do
with
the
criminalist
it
is
in
its
intention
most
important
for
him
the
motive
of
a
series
of
phenomena
and
events
both
in
prisoners
and
witnesses
is
emotion
in
what
follows
therefore
we
shall
attempt
to
show
that
feeling
in
so
far
as
we
need
to
consider
it
need
not
be
taken
as
an
especial
function
this
is
only
so
far
significant
as
to
make
our
work
easier
by
limiting
it
to
fewer
subjects
if
we
can
reduce
some
one
psychic
function
to
another
category
we
can
explain
many
a
thing
even
when
we
know
only
the
latter
in
any
event
the
study
of
a
single
category
is
simpler
than
that
of
many
abstractly
the
word
emotion
is
the
property
or
capacity
of
the
mind
to
be
influenced
pleasantly
or
unpleasantly
by
sensations
perceptions
and
ideas
concretely
it
means
the
conditions
of
desire
or
disgust
which
are
developed
by
the
complex
of
conditions
thereby
aroused
we
have
first
to
distinguish
between
the
animal
and
the
higher
emotions
we
will
assume
that
this
distinction
is
incorrect
inasmuch
as
between
these
classes
there
is
a
series
of
feelings
which
may
be
counted
as
well
with
one
as
with
the
other
so
that
the
transition
is
incidental
and
no
strict
differentiation
is
possible
we
will
however
retain
the
distinction
as
it
is
easier
by
means
of
it
to
pass
from
the
simpler
to
the
more
difficult
emotions
the
indubitably
animal
passions
we
shall
take
to
be
hunger
thirst
cold
etc
these
are
first
of
all
purely
physiological
stimuli
which
act
on
our
body
but
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
one
of
them
without
at
the
same
time
inevitably
bringing
in
the
idea
of
the
defense
against
this
physiological
stimulus
it
is
impossible
to
think
of
the
feeling
of
hunger
without
sensing
also
the
strain
to
find
relief
from
this
feeling
for
without
this
sensation
hunger
would
not
appear
as
such
if
i
am
hungry
i
go
for
food
if
i
am
cold
i
seek
for
warmth
if
i
feel
pain
i
try
to
wipe
it
out
how
to
satisfy
these
desiderative
actions
is
a
problem
for
the
understanding
whence
it
follows
that
successful
satisfaction
intelligent
or
unintelligent
may
vary
in
every
possible
degree
we
see
that
the
least
intelligent
real
cretins
sometimes
are
unable
to
satisfy
their
hunger
for
when
food
is
given
the
worst
of
them
they
stuff
it
in
spite
of
acute
sensations
of
hunger
into
their
ears
and
noses
but
not
into
their
mouths
we
must
therefore
say
that
there
is
always
a
demand
for
a
minimum
quantity
of
intelligence
in
order
to
know
that
the
feeling
of
hunger
may
be
vanquished
by
putting
food
into
the
mouth
one
step
further
in
the
description
of
the
conduct
of
anthropoid
apes
which
are
kept
in
menageries
especial
intelligence
is
assigned
to
those
who
know
how
to
draw
a
blanket
over
themselves
as
protection
against
cold
the
same
action
is
held
to
be
a
sign
of
intelligence
in
very
young
children
still
more
thoroughly
graded
is
the
attitude
toward
pain
inasmuch
as
barely
a
trace
of
intelligence
is
required
in
order
to
know
that
it
is
necessary
to
wipe
away
a
hot
liquid
drop
that
has
fallen
on
the
body
every
physiological
mentions
the
fact
that
a
decapitated
frog
makes
such
wiping
movements
when
it
is
wet
with
acid
from
this
unconscious
activity
of
the
understanding
to
the
technically
treatment
of
a
burn
a
whole
series
of
progressively
higher
expressions
of
intelligence
may
be
interpolated
a
series
so
great
as
to
defy
counting
now
take
another
still
animal
but
more
feeling
for
example
the
feeling
of
comfort
we
lay
a
cat
on
a
soft
bolster
she
stretches
herself
spreads
and
thins
herself
out
in
order
to
bring
as
many
nerve
termini
as
possible
into
contact
with
the
pleasant
stimuli
of
the
bolster
this
behavior
of
the
cat
may
be
construed
as
instinctive
also
as
the
aboriginal
source
of
the
sense
of
comfort
and
as
leading
to
luxury
in
comfort
the
stage
of
comfort
which
roscher
calls
highest
i
luxury
in
eating
and
drinking
ii
luxury
in
dress
iii
luxury
in
comfort
therefore
we
may
say
that
the
reaction
of
the
understanding
to
the
physiological
stimulus
aims
to
set
it
aside
when
it
is
unpleasant
and
to
increase
and
exhaust
it
when
it
is
pleasant
and
that
in
a
certain
sense
both
coincide
the
ousting
of
unpleasant
darkness
is
equivalent
to
the
introduction
of
pleasant
light
we
may
therefore
say
generally
that
feeling
is
a
physiological
stimulus
indivisibly
connected
with
the
sensitive
attitude
thereto
of
course
there
is
a
far
cry
from
instinctive
exclusion
and
inclusion
to
the
most
refined
defensive
preparation
or
interpretation
but
the
differences
which
lie
next
to
each
on
either
side
are
only
differences
in
degree
now
let
us
think
of
some
higher
feeling
and
consider
a
special
case
of
it
i
meet
for
the
first
time
a
man
who
is
unpleasantly
marked
with
badly
colored
hair
this
stimulates
my
eyes
disagreeably
and
i
seek
either
by
looking
away
or
by
wishing
the
man
away
to
protect
myself
from
this
influence
which
already
eliminates
all
feeling
of
friendship
for
this
harmless
individual
now
i
see
that
the
man
is
torturing
an
animal
i
do
not
like
to
see
this
it
affects
me
painfully
hence
i
wish
him
out
of
the
way
still
more
energetically
if
he
goes
on
so
adding
one
disagreeable
characteristic
to
another
i
might
break
his
bones
to
stop
him
bind
him
in
chains
to
hinder
him
i
even
might
kill
him
to
save
myself
the
unpleasant
excitation
he
causes
me
i
strain
my
intelligence
to
think
of
some
means
of
opposing
him
and
clearly
in
this
case
also
physiological
stimulus
and
activity
of
the
understanding
are
invincibly
united
the
emotion
of
anger
is
rather
more
difficult
to
explain
but
it
is
not
like
hatred
for
it
is
acute
while
hatred
is
chronic
i
might
be
angry
with
my
beloved
child
but
though
at
the
moment
of
anger
the
expression
is
identical
with
that
of
hatred
it
is
also
transitive
in
the
extremest
cases
the
negating
action
aims
to
destroy
the
stimulus
this
is
the
most
radical
means
of
avoiding
physiological
excitation
and
hence
i
tear
in
pieces
a
disagreeable
letter
or
stamp
to
powder
the
object
on
which
i
have
hurt
myself
where
persons
are
involved
i
proceed
either
directly
or
symbolically
when
i
can
not
or
may
not
get
my
hands
on
the
responsible
one
the
case
is
the
same
with
feeling
of
attraction
i
own
a
dog
he
has
beautiful
lines
which
are
pleasant
to
my
eye
he
has
a
bark
that
stimulates
my
ear
pleasantly
he
has
a
soft
coat
which
is
pleasant
to
my
stroking
hand
i
know
that
in
case
of
need
the
dog
will
protect
me
and
that
is
a
calming
consideration
i
know
that
he
may
be
otherwise
of
use
to
me
in
short
my
understanding
tells
me
all
kinds
of
pleasant
things
about
the
beast
hence
i
like
to
have
him
near
me
i
like
him
the
same
explanation
may
be
applied
to
all
emotions
of
inclination
or
repulsion
everywhere
we
find
the
emotion
as
physiological
stimulus
in
indivisible
union
with
a
number
of
partly
known
partly
unknown
functions
of
the
understanding
the
unknown
play
an
important
r√¥le
they
are
serial
understandings
inherited
from
remote
ancestors
and
are
characterized
by
the
fact
that
they
lead
us
to
do
the
things
we
do
when
we
recognize
intelligently
any
event
and
its
requirements
when
one
gets
thirsty
he
drinks
cattle
do
the
same
and
they
drink
even
when
nobody
has
told
them
to
because
this
is
an
inherited
action
of
countless
years
if
a
man
is
however
to
proceed
intelligently
about
his
drinking
he
will
say
drying
or
other
forms
of
segregation
the
water
will
be
drawn
from
the
cells
of
my
body
they
will
become
arid
and
will
no
longer
be
sufficiently
elastic
to
do
their
work
if
now
by
way
of
my
stomach
through
endosmosis
and
exosmosis
i
get
them
more
water
the
proper
conditions
will
the
consequences
of
this
form
of
consideration
will
not
be
different
from
the
instinctive
action
of
the
most
elementary
of
animals
the
wise
man
and
the
animal
drink
so
the
whole
content
of
every
emotion
is
physiological
stimulation
and
function
of
the
understanding
and
what
good
is
all
this
to
the
criminal
lawyer
nobody
doubts
that
both
prisoners
and
witnesses
are
subject
to
the
powerful
influence
of
emotional
expression
nobody
doubts
that
the
determination
interpretation
and
judgment
of
these
expressions
are
as
difficult
as
they
are
important
to
the
judge
and
when
we
consider
these
emotions
as
especial
conditions
of
the
mind
it
is
indubitable
that
they
are
able
to
cause
still
greater
difficulty
because
of
their
elusiveness
their
very
various
intensity
and
their
confused
effect
once
however
we
think
of
them
as
functions
of
the
understanding
we
have
in
its
activities
something
better
known
something
rather
more
disciplined
which
offers
very
many
fewer
difficulties
in
the
judgment
concerning
the
fixed
form
in
which
it
acts
hence
every
judgment
of
an
emotional
state
must
be
preceded
by
a
reconstruction
in
terms
of
the
implied
functions
of
the
understanding
once
this
is
done
further
treatment
is
no
longer
difficult
topic
the
forms
of
giving
testimony
section
wherever
we
turn
we
face
the
absolute
importance
of
language
for
our
work
whatever
we
hear
or
read
concerning
a
crime
is
expressed
in
words
and
everything
perceived
with
the
eye
or
any
other
sense
must
be
clothed
in
words
before
it
can
be
put
to
use
that
the
criminalist
must
know
this
first
and
most
important
means
of
understanding
completely
and
in
all
its
refinements
is
but
still
more
is
required
of
him
he
must
first
of
all
undertake
a
careful
investigation
of
the
essence
of
language
itself
a
glance
over
literature
shows
how
the
earliest
scholars
have
aimed
to
study
language
with
regard
to
its
origins
and
character
yet
who
needs
this
knowledge
the
lawyer
other
disciplines
can
find
in
it
only
a
scientific
interest
but
it
is
practically
and
absolutely
valuable
only
for
us
lawyers
who
must
by
means
of
language
take
evidence
remember
it
and
variously
interpret
it
a
failure
in
a
proper
understanding
of
language
may
give
rise
to
false
conceptions
and
the
most
serious
of
mistakes
hence
nobody
is
so
bound
as
the
criminal
lawyer
to
study
the
general
character
of
language
and
to
familiarize
himself
with
its
force
nature
and
development
without
this
knowledge
the
lawyer
may
be
able
to
make
use
of
language
but
failing
to
understand
it
will
slip
up
before
the
slightest
difficulty
there
is
an
exceedingly
rich
literature
open
to
everybody
section
a
general
study
of
variety
in
forms
of
expression
men
being
different
in
nature
and
on
the
one
hand
and
language
being
on
the
other
a
living
organism
which
varies
with
its
soil
with
the
human
individual
who
makes
use
of
it
it
is
inevitable
that
each
man
should
have
especial
and
private
forms
of
expression
these
forms
if
the
man
comes
before
us
as
witness
or
prisoner
we
must
study
each
by
itself
fortunately
this
study
must
be
combined
with
another
that
it
implies
the
character
and
nature
of
the
individual
the
one
without
the
other
is
unthinkable
whoever
aims
to
study
a
character
must
first
of
all
attend
to
his
ways
of
expression
inasmuch
as
these
are
most
significant
of
a
qualities
and
most
illuminating
a
man
is
as
he
speaks
it
is
not
possible
on
the
other
hand
to
study
modes
of
expression
in
themselves
their
observation
requires
the
study
of
a
group
of
other
conditions
if
the
form
of
speech
is
to
be
explained
or
its
analysis
made
even
possible
thus
one
is
involved
in
the
other
and
once
you
know
clearly
the
tricks
of
speech
belonging
to
an
individual
you
also
have
a
clear
conception
of
his
character
and
conversely
this
study
requires
no
doubt
considerable
skill
but
that
is
at
the
command
of
anybody
who
is
devoted
to
the
task
tylor
is
correct
in
his
assertion
that
a
speech
indicates
his
origin
much
less
than
his
his
education
and
his
power
much
of
this
fact
is
due
to
the
nature
of
language
as
a
living
growth
and
moving
organism
which
acquires
new
and
especial
forms
to
express
new
and
especial
events
in
human
life
geiger
cites
the
following
example
of
such
changes
in
the
meaning
of
words
means
in
sanscrit
beast
in
zend
it
means
merely
and
the
equivalent
persian
term
continues
to
mean
only
so
that
the
barnyard
fowls
are
now
called
thus
the
first
meaning
has
been
transmuted
into
its
opposite
in
other
cases
we
may
incorrectly
suppose
certain
expressions
to
stand
for
certain
things
we
say
bake
bread
to
bake
cake
to
bake
certain
meats
and
then
again
roast
apples
to
roast
potatoes
to
roast
certain
we
should
laugh
if
some
foreigner
told
us
that
he
had
bread
these
forms
of
expression
have
as
yet
no
relation
to
character
but
they
are
the
of
quite
characteristic
modes
which
establish
themselves
in
all
corporations
groups
classes
such
as
students
soldiers
hunters
as
well
as
among
the
middle
classes
in
large
cities
forms
of
this
kind
may
become
so
significant
that
the
use
of
a
single
one
of
them
might
put
the
user
in
question
into
jeopardy
i
once
saw
two
old
gentlemen
on
a
train
who
did
not
know
each
other
they
fell
into
conversation
and
one
told
the
other
that
he
had
seen
an
officer
while
jumping
from
his
horse
trip
over
his
sword
and
fall
but
instead
of
the
word
sword
he
made
use
of
the
old
slang
word
and
the
other
old
boy
looked
at
him
with
shining
eyes
and
cried
out
brother
what
color
still
more
remarkable
is
the
mutation
and
addition
of
new
words
of
especially
definite
meaning
among
certain
classes
the
words
become
more
modern
like
so
much
slang
the
especial
use
of
certain
forms
is
individual
as
well
as
social
every
person
has
his
private
usage
one
makes
use
of
another
of
indeed
one
prefers
another
this
fact
has
a
double
significance
sometimes
a
giving
a
word
a
definite
meaning
may
explain
his
whole
nature
how
heartless
and
raw
is
the
statement
of
a
doctor
who
is
telling
about
a
painful
operation
patient
sang
in
addition
it
is
frequently
necessary
to
investigate
the
connotation
people
like
to
give
certain
words
otherwise
misunderstandings
are
inevitable
this
investigation
is
as
a
rule
not
easy
for
even
when
it
is
simple
to
bring
out
what
is
intended
by
an
expression
it
is
still
quite
as
simple
to
overlook
the
fact
that
people
use
peculiar
expressions
for
ordinary
things
this
occurs
particularly
when
people
are
led
astray
by
the
substitution
of
similars
and
by
the
repetition
of
such
a
substitution
very
few
persons
are
able
to
distinguish
between
identity
and
similarity
most
of
them
take
these
two
characters
to
be
equivalent
if
a
and
b
are
otherwise
identical
save
that
b
is
a
little
bigger
so
that
they
appear
similar
there
is
no
great
mistake
if
i
hold
them
to
be
equivalent
and
substitute
b
for
a
now
i
compare
b
with
c
c
with
d
d
with
e
and
each
member
of
the
series
is
progressively
bigger
than
its
predecessor
if
now
i
continue
to
repeat
my
first
mistake
i
have
in
the
end
substituted
for
a
the
enormously
bigger
e
and
the
mistake
has
become
a
very
notable
one
i
certainly
would
not
have
substituted
e
for
a
at
the
beginning
but
the
repeated
substitution
of
similars
has
led
me
to
this
complete
incommensurability
such
substitutions
occur
frequently
during
the
alterations
of
meanings
and
if
you
wish
to
see
how
some
remarkable
signification
of
a
term
has
arisen
you
will
generally
find
it
as
a
progression
through
gradually
remoter
similarities
to
complete
dissimilarity
all
such
extraordinary
alterations
which
a
word
has
undergone
in
the
course
of
long
usage
and
for
which
each
linguistic
contains
numerous
examples
may
however
develop
with
comparative
speed
in
each
individual
speaker
and
if
the
development
is
not
traced
may
lead
in
the
to
very
serious
misunderstandings
substitutions
and
hence
sudden
alterations
occur
when
the
material
of
language
especially
in
primitive
tongues
contains
only
simple
differentiations
so
tylor
mentions
the
fact
that
the
language
of
the
west
african
wolofs
contains
the
word
to
go
to
stride
proudly
to
beg
dejectedly
to
demand
the
mpongwes
say
tonda
i
love
and
t√¥nda
i
do
not
love
such
differentiations
in
tone
our
own
people
make
also
and
the
mutation
of
meaning
is
very
close
but
who
observes
it
at
all
important
as
are
the
changes
in
the
meanings
of
words
they
fall
short
beside
the
changes
of
meaning
of
the
conception
given
in
the
mode
of
exposition
hence
there
are
still
greater
mistakes
because
a
single
error
is
neither
easily
noticeable
nor
traceable
mill
says
justly
that
the
ancient
scientists
missed
a
great
deal
because
they
were
guided
by
linguistic
classification
it
scarcely
occurred
to
them
that
what
they
assigned
abstract
names
to
really
consisted
of
several
phenomena
nevertheless
the
mistake
has
been
inherited
and
people
who
nowadays
name
abstract
things
conceive
according
to
their
intelligence
now
this
and
now
that
phenomenon
by
means
of
it
then
they
wonder
at
the
other
not
understanding
them
the
situation
being
so
the
criminalist
is
coercively
required
whenever
anything
abstract
is
named
first
of
all
to
determine
accurately
what
the
interlocutor
means
by
his
word
in
these
cases
we
make
the
curious
discovery
that
such
determination
is
most
necessary
among
people
who
have
studied
the
object
profoundly
for
a
technical
language
arises
with
just
the
persons
who
have
dealt
especially
with
any
one
subject
as
a
rule
it
must
be
maintained
that
time
even
a
little
time
makes
an
essential
difference
in
the
conception
of
any
object
mittermaier
and
indeed
bentham
have
shown
what
an
influence
the
interval
between
observation
and
announcement
exercises
on
the
form
of
exposition
the
witness
who
is
immediately
examined
may
perhaps
say
the
same
thing
that
he
would
say
several
weeks
after
but
his
presentation
is
different
he
uses
different
words
he
understands
by
the
different
words
different
concepts
and
so
his
testimony
becomes
altered
a
similar
effect
may
be
brought
about
by
the
conditions
under
which
the
evidence
is
given
every
one
of
us
knows
what
surprising
differences
occur
between
the
statements
of
the
witness
made
in
the
silent
office
of
the
examining
justice
and
his
secretary
and
what
he
says
in
the
open
trial
before
the
jury
there
is
frequently
an
inclination
to
attack
angrily
the
witnesses
who
make
such
divergent
statements
yet
more
accurate
observation
would
show
that
the
testimony
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
former
but
that
the
manner
of
giving
it
is
different
and
hence
the
apparently
different
story
the
difference
between
the
members
of
the
audience
has
a
powerful
influence
it
is
generally
true
that
reproductive
construction
is
intensified
by
the
sight
of
a
larger
number
of
attentive
hearers
but
this
is
not
without
exception
in
the
words
there
is
the
notion
that
the
speaker
is
speaking
interestingly
and
well
for
otherwise
his
hearers
would
not
be
attentive
and
if
anything
is
well
done
and
is
known
to
be
well
done
the
number
of
the
listeners
is
exciting
inasmuch
as
each
listener
is
reckoned
as
a
stimulating
admirer
this
is
invariably
the
case
if
anybody
is
doing
a
piece
of
work
under
observation
he
will
feel
pleasant
when
he
knows
that
he
is
doing
it
well
but
he
will
feel
disturbed
and
troubled
if
he
is
certain
of
his
lack
of
skill
so
we
may
grant
that
a
large
number
of
listeners
increases
reproductive
constructivity
but
only
when
the
speaker
is
certain
of
his
subject
and
of
the
favor
of
his
auditors
of
the
latter
strained
attention
is
not
always
evidence
when
a
scholar
is
speaking
of
some
subject
chosen
by
himself
and
his
audience
listens
to
him
attentively
he
has
chosen
his
subject
fortunately
and
speaks
well
the
attention
acts
as
a
spur
he
speaks
still
better
etc
but
this
changes
when
in
the
course
of
a
great
trial
which
excites
general
interest
the
witness
for
the
government
appears
strained
attention
will
also
be
the
rule
but
it
does
not
apply
to
him
it
applies
to
the
subject
he
has
not
chosen
his
topic
and
no
recognition
for
it
is
due
him
it
is
indifferent
to
him
whether
he
speaks
ill
or
well
the
interest
belongs
only
to
the
subject
and
the
speaker
himself
receives
perhaps
the
undivided
antipathy
hatred
disgust
or
scorn
of
all
the
listeners
nevertheless
attention
is
intense
and
strained
and
inasmuch
as
the
speaker
knows
that
this
does
not
pertain
to
him
or
his
merits
it
confuses
and
depresses
him
it
is
for
this
reason
that
so
many
criminal
trials
turn
out
quite
contrary
to
expectation
those
who
have
seen
the
trial
only
and
were
not
at
the
prior
examination
understand
the
result
still
less
when
they
are
told
that
has
altered
since
the
prior
examination
and
yet
much
has
altered
the
witnesses
excited
or
frightened
by
the
crowd
of
listeners
have
spoken
and
expressed
themselves
otherwise
than
before
until
in
this
manner
the
whole
case
has
become
different
in
a
similar
fashion
some
fact
may
be
shown
in
another
light
by
the
manner
of
narration
used
by
a
particular
witness
take
as
example
some
energetically
influential
quality
like
humor
it
is
that
joke
witticism
comedy
are
excluded
from
the
but
if
somebody
has
actually
introduced
real
genuine
humor
by
way
of
the
dry
form
of
his
testimony
without
having
crossed
in
a
single
word
the
permissible
limit
he
may
not
rarely
narrate
a
very
serious
story
so
as
to
reduce
its
dangerous
aspect
to
a
minimum
frequently
the
testimony
of
some
funny
witness
makes
the
rounds
of
all
the
newspapers
for
the
pleasure
of
their
readers
everybody
knows
how
a
really
humorous
person
may
so
narrate
experiences
doubtful
situations
of
his
student
days
unpleasant
traveling
experiences
difficult
positions
in
quarrels
that
every
listener
must
laugh
at
the
same
time
the
events
told
of
were
troublesome
difficult
even
quite
dangerous
the
narrator
does
not
in
the
least
lie
but
he
manages
to
give
his
story
the
twist
that
even
the
victim
of
the
situation
is
glad
to
laugh
at
as
kr√§pelin
says
task
of
humor
is
to
rob
a
large
portion
of
human
misfortune
of
its
wounding
power
it
does
so
by
presenting
to
us
with
our
fellows
as
samples
the
comedy
of
the
innumerable
stupidities
of
human
now
suppose
that
a
really
humorous
witness
tells
a
story
which
involves
very
considerable
consequences
but
which
he
does
not
really
end
with
tragic
conclusions
suppose
the
subject
to
be
a
great
brawl
some
really
crass
deception
some
story
of
an
attack
on
honor
etc
the
attitude
toward
the
event
is
altered
with
one
turn
even
though
it
would
seem
to
have
been
generated
progressively
by
ten
preceding
witnesses
and
the
new
view
of
the
matter
makes
itself
valid
at
least
mildly
in
the
delivery
of
the
sentence
then
whoever
has
not
heard
the
whole
story
understands
the
results
least
of
all
in
the
same
way
we
see
really
harmless
events
turned
into
tragedies
by
the
testimony
of
a
melancholy
witness
without
his
having
used
in
this
case
or
any
other
a
single
untrue
word
in
like
manner
the
bitterness
of
a
witness
who
considers
his
personal
experiences
to
be
generally
true
may
color
and
determine
the
attitude
of
some
not
at
all
serious
event
nor
is
this
exaggeration
every
man
of
experience
will
if
he
is
only
honest
enough
confirm
the
fact
and
grant
that
he
himself
was
among
those
whose
attitude
has
been
so
altered
i
avoid
the
expression
it
is
necessary
here
also
to
repeat
that
the
movements
of
the
hands
and
other
gestures
of
the
witnesses
while
making
their
statements
will
help
much
to
keep
the
correct
balance
movements
lie
much
less
frequently
than
words
another
means
of
discovering
whether
a
witness
is
not
seduced
by
his
attitude
and
his
own
qualities
is
the
careful
observation
of
the
impression
his
narrative
makes
on
himself
stricker
has
controlled
the
conditions
of
speech
and
has
observed
that
so
long
as
he
continued
to
bring
clearly
described
complexes
into
a
causal
relation
to
he
could
excite
his
auditors
as
soon
as
he
spoke
of
a
relation
which
satisfy
him
the
attitude
of
the
audience
altered
we
must
invert
this
observation
we
are
the
auditors
of
the
witness
and
must
observe
whether
his
own
causal
connections
satisfy
him
so
long
as
this
is
the
case
we
believe
him
when
it
fails
to
be
so
he
is
either
lying
or
he
himself
knows
that
he
is
not
expressing
himself
as
he
ought
to
make
us
correctly
understand
what
he
is
talking
about
section
b
dialect
forms
what
every
criminal
lawyer
must
unconditionally
know
is
the
dialect
of
those
people
he
has
most
to
deal
with
this
is
so
important
that
i
should
hold
it
conscienceless
to
engage
in
the
profession
of
criminology
without
knowing
the
dialects
nobody
with
experience
would
dispute
my
assertion
that
nothing
is
the
cause
of
so
great
and
so
serious
misunderstandings
of
even
inversions
of
justice
as
ignorance
of
dialects
ignorance
of
the
manner
of
expression
of
human
groups
wrongs
so
caused
can
never
be
rectified
because
their
primary
falsehood
starts
in
the
protocol
where
no
denial
no
dispute
and
redefinition
can
change
them
it
is
no
great
difficulty
to
learn
dialects
if
only
one
is
not
seduced
by
comic
pride
and
foolish
ignorance
of
his
own
advantage
into
believing
that
popular
speech
is
something
low
or
common
dialect
has
as
many
rights
as
literary
language
is
as
living
and
interesting
an
organism
as
the
most
developed
form
of
expression
once
the
interest
in
dialect
is
awakened
all
that
is
required
is
the
learning
of
a
number
of
meanings
otherwise
there
are
no
difficulties
for
the
form
of
speech
of
the
real
peasant
and
this
is
true
all
over
the
world
is
always
the
simplest
the
most
natural
and
the
briefest
tricks
difficult
construction
circumlocutions
are
unknown
to
the
peasant
and
if
he
is
only
left
to
himself
he
makes
everything
definite
clear
and
easily
intelligible
there
are
many
more
difficulties
in
the
forms
of
expression
of
the
uncultivated
city
man
who
has
snapped
up
a
number
of
uncomprehended
phrases
and
tries
to
make
use
of
them
because
of
their
suppositious
beauty
regardless
of
their
fitness
unpleasant
as
it
is
to
hear
such
a
screwed
and
twisted
series
of
phrases
without
beginning
and
without
end
it
is
equally
difficult
to
get
a
clear
notion
of
what
the
man
wanted
to
say
and
especially
whether
the
phrases
used
were
really
brought
out
with
some
purpose
or
simply
for
the
sake
of
showing
off
because
they
sound
in
this
direction
nothing
is
more
significant
than
the
use
of
the
imperfect
in
countries
where
its
use
is
not
customary
and
where
as
a
rule
only
the
perfect
is
used
not
was
going
but
have
went
in
part
the
reading
of
newspapers
but
partly
also
the
unfortunate
habit
of
our
school
teachers
compel
children
to
the
use
of
the
imperfect
which
has
not
an
iota
more
justification
than
the
perfect
and
which
people
make
use
of
under
certain
circumstances
when
they
are
talking
to
educated
people
and
then
only
before
they
have
reached
a
certain
age
i
confess
that
i
regularly
mistrust
a
witness
who
makes
use
of
an
imperfect
or
some
other
form
not
habitual
to
him
i
presuppose
that
he
is
a
person
who
has
allowed
himself
to
be
persuaded
i
believe
that
he
is
not
altogether
reliable
because
he
permits
untrue
forms
to
express
his
meaning
and
i
fear
that
he
neglects
the
content
for
the
sake
of
the
form
the
simple
person
who
quietly
and
without
shame
makes
use
of
his
natural
dialect
supplies
no
ground
for
mistrust
there
are
a
few
traits
of
usage
which
must
always
be
watched
first
of
all
all
dialects
are
in
certain
directions
poorer
than
the
literary
language
they
make
use
of
fewer
colors
the
blue
grape
the
red
wine
may
be
indicated
by
the
word
black
the
light
wine
by
the
word
white
literary
language
has
adopted
the
last
term
from
dialect
nobody
says
or
yellow
wine
although
nobody
has
ever
yet
seen
white
wine
similarly
no
peasant
says
a
dog
a
these
colors
are
always
denoted
by
the
word
red
this
is
important
in
the
description
of
clothes
there
is
however
no
contradiction
between
this
trait
and
the
fact
that
the
dialect
may
be
rich
in
terms
denoting
objects
that
may
be
very
useful
the
handle
of
a
tool
may
be
called
handle
grasp
haft
stick
clasp
etc
when
foreign
words
are
used
it
is
necessary
to
observe
in
what
tendency
and
what
meaning
their
adoption
embodies
the
great
difficulty
of
getting
uneducated
people
to
give
their
testimony
in
direct
discourse
is
remarkable
you
might
ask
for
the
words
of
the
speaker
ten
times
and
you
always
hear
told
me
i
should
enter
you
never
hear
told
me
this
is
to
be
explained
by
the
fact
already
mentioned
that
people
bear
in
mind
only
the
meaning
of
what
they
have
heard
when
the
question
of
the
actual
words
is
raised
the
sole
way
to
conquer
this
disagreeable
tendency
is
to
develop
dialogue
and
to
say
to
the
witness
you
are
a
and
i
am
b
how
did
it
happen
but
even
this
device
may
fail
and
when
you
finally
do
compel
direct
quotation
you
can
not
be
certain
of
its
reliability
for
it
was
too
extraordinary
for
the
witness
to
quote
directly
and
the
extraordinary
and
unhabitual
is
always
unsafe
what
especially
wants
consideration
in
the
real
peasant
is
his
silence
i
do
not
know
whether
the
reasons
for
the
silence
of
the
countrymen
all
the
world
over
have
ever
been
sought
but
a
gossiping
peasant
is
rare
to
find
this
trait
is
unfortunately
exhibited
in
the
failure
to
defend
himself
when
we
make
use
of
energetic
investigation
it
is
said
that
not
to
defend
yourself
is
to
show
courage
and
this
may
indeed
be
a
kind
of
nobility
a
disgust
at
the
accusation
or
certainty
of
innocence
but
frequently
it
is
mere
incapacity
to
speak
and
inexperienced
judges
may
regard
it
as
an
expression
of
cunning
or
conviction
it
is
wise
therefore
in
this
connection
not
to
be
in
too
great
a
hurry
and
to
seek
to
understand
clearly
the
nature
of
the
silent
person
if
we
become
convinced
that
the
latter
is
by
nature
uncommunicative
we
must
not
wonder
that
he
does
not
speak
even
when
words
appear
to
be
quite
necessary
in
certain
cases
uneducated
people
must
be
studied
from
the
same
point
of
view
as
children
geiger
speaks
of
a
child
who
knew
only
one
boy
and
all
the
other
boys
were
otho
to
him
because
this
first
boy
was
called
otho
so
the
recruit
at
the
rhine
believed
that
in
his
country
the
rhine
was
called
donau
the
child
and
the
uneducated
person
can
not
subordinate
things
under
higher
concepts
every
painted
square
might
be
a
and
every
painted
circle
a
plate
new
things
receive
the
names
of
old
ones
and
frequently
the
skill
of
the
criminalists
consists
in
deriving
important
material
from
apparently
worthless
statements
by
way
of
discovering
the
proper
significance
of
simple
inartistic
but
in
most
cases
excellently
definitive
images
it
is
of
course
that
one
must
absolutely
refrain
from
trickery
section
c
incorrect
forms
of
expression
if
it
is
true
that
by
the
earnest
and
repeated
study
of
the
meanings
of
words
we
are
likely
to
find
them
in
the
end
containing
much
deeper
sense
and
content
than
at
the
beginning
we
are
compelled
to
wonder
that
people
are
able
to
understand
each
other
at
all
for
if
words
do
not
have
that
meaning
which
is
obvious
in
their
essential
denotation
every
one
who
uses
them
supplies
according
to
his
inclination
and
status
the
and
richer
as
a
matter
of
fact
many
more
words
are
used
pictorially
than
we
are
inclined
to
think
choose
at
random
and
you
find
surprisingly
numerous
words
with
exaggerated
denotations
if
i
say
posit
the
case
i
press
through
i
jump
over
the
proposition
these
phrases
are
all
pictures
for
i
have
posited
nothing
i
have
pressed
through
no
obstacle
and
have
jumped
over
no
object
my
words
therefore
have
not
stood
for
anything
real
but
for
an
image
and
it
is
impossible
to
determine
the
remoteness
of
the
latter
from
the
former
or
the
variety
of
direction
and
extent
this
remoteness
may
receive
from
each
individual
wherever
images
are
made
use
of
therefore
we
must
if
we
are
to
know
what
is
meant
first
establish
how
and
where
the
use
occurred
how
frequently
we
hear
of
a
table
instead
of
a
square
table
a
man
instead
of
a
man
who
is
far
below
the
average
in
many
cases
this
false
expression
is
made
for
the
purpose
of
beautifying
a
request
or
making
it
appear
more
modest
the
smoker
says
i
have
some
light
although
you
know
that
it
is
perfectly
indifferent
whether
much
or
little
light
is
taken
from
the
cigar
i
have
just
a
little
piece
of
roast
is
said
in
order
to
make
the
request
that
the
other
fellow
should
pass
the
heavy
platter
seem
more
modest
and
again
give
me
a
little
water
does
not
modify
the
fact
that
the
other
fellow
must
pass
the
whole
water
flask
and
that
it
is
indifferent
to
him
whether
afterwards
you
take
much
or
little
water
so
frequently
we
speak
of
borrowing
or
lending
without
in
the
remotest
thinking
of
returning
the
student
says
to
his
comrade
me
a
pen
some
paper
or
some
ink
but
he
has
not
at
all
any
intention
of
giving
them
back
similar
things
are
to
be
discovered
in
accused
or
witnesses
who
think
they
have
not
behaved
properly
and
who
then
want
to
exhibit
their
misconduct
in
the
most
favorable
light
these
beautifications
frequently
go
so
far
and
may
be
made
so
skilfully
that
the
correct
situation
may
not
be
observed
for
a
long
time
habitual
usage
offers
in
this
case
also
the
best
examples
for
years
uncountable
it
has
been
called
a
cruel
job
to
earn
your
living
honestly
and
to
satisfy
the
absolute
needs
of
many
people
by
quickly
and
painlessly
slaughtering
cattle
but
when
somebody
just
for
the
sake
of
killing
time
because
of
ennui
shoots
and
martyrs
harmless
animals
or
merely
so
wounds
them
that
if
they
are
not
retrieved
they
must
die
terrible
deaths
we
call
it
noble
sport
i
should
like
to
see
a
demonstration
of
the
difference
between
killing
an
ox
and
shooting
a
stag
the
latter
does
not
require
even
superior
skill
for
it
is
much
more
difficult
to
kill
an
ox
swiftly
and
painlessly
than
to
shoot
a
stag
badly
and
even
the
most
accurate
shot
requires
less
training
than
the
correct
slaughter
of
an
ox
moreover
it
requires
much
more
courage
to
finish
a
wild
ox
than
to
destroy
a
tame
and
kindly
pheasant
but
usage
once
and
for
all
has
assumed
this
essential
distinction
between
men
and
frequently
this
distinction
is
effective
in
criminal
law
without
our
really
seeing
how
or
why
the
situation
is
similar
in
the
difference
between
cheating
in
a
horse
trade
and
cheating
about
other
commodities
it
occurs
in
the
distinction
between
two
duellists
fighting
according
to
rule
and
two
peasant
lads
brawling
with
the
handles
of
their
picks
according
to
agreement
it
recurs
again
in
the
violation
of
the
law
by
somebody
inspired
with
champagne
as
against
its
violation
by
some
drunkard
but
usage
has
a
favoring
excusing
intent
for
the
first
series
and
an
accusing
rejecting
intent
for
the
latter
series
the
different
points
of
view
from
which
various
events
are
seen
are
the
consequence
of
the
varieties
of
the
usage
which
first
distinguished
the
from
one
another
there
is
moreover
a
certain
dishonesty
in
speaking
and
in
listening
where
the
speaker
knows
that
the
hearer
is
hearing
a
different
matter
and
the
hearer
knows
that
the
speaker
is
speaking
a
different
matter
as
steinthal
has
said
the
speaker
speaks
about
things
that
he
does
not
believe
and
the
reality
of
which
he
takes
no
stock
in
his
auditor
at
the
same
time
knows
right
well
what
the
former
has
said
he
understands
correctly
and
does
not
blame
the
speaker
for
having
expressed
himself
altogether
this
occurs
very
frequently
in
daily
routine
without
causing
much
difficulty
in
human
intercourse
but
it
ought
for
this
reason
to
occur
inversely
in
our
conversation
with
witnesses
and
accused
i
know
that
the
manner
of
speaking
just
described
is
frequently
used
when
a
witness
wants
to
clothe
some
definite
suspicion
without
expressing
it
explicitly
in
such
cases
the
examiner
as
well
as
the
witness
believes
that
x
is
the
criminal
for
some
reason
perhaps
because
x
is
a
close
relation
of
the
witness
or
of
man
higher
up
neither
of
them
judge
nor
witness
wishes
to
utter
the
truth
openly
and
so
they
feel
round
the
subject
for
an
interminable
time
if
now
both
think
the
same
thing
there
results
at
most
only
a
loss
of
time
but
no
other
misfortune
when
however
each
thinks
of
a
different
object
each
thinks
of
another
criminal
but
each
believes
mistakenly
that
he
agrees
with
the
other
their
separating
without
having
made
explicit
what
they
think
may
lead
to
harmful
misunderstandings
if
the
examiner
then
believes
that
the
witness
agrees
with
him
and
proceeds
upon
this
only
apparently
certain
basis
the
case
may
become
very
bad
the
results
are
the
same
when
a
confession
is
discussed
with
a
suspect
when
the
judge
thinks
that
the
suspect
would
like
to
confess
but
only
suggests
confession
while
the
latter
has
never
even
thought
of
it
the
one
thing
alone
our
work
permits
of
is
open
and
clear
speaking
any
confused
form
of
expression
is
evil
nevertheless
confusions
often
occur
involuntarily
and
as
they
can
not
be
avoided
they
must
be
understood
thus
it
is
characteristic
to
understand
something
unknown
in
terms
of
some
known
example
the
romans
who
first
saw
an
elephant
called
it
similarly
wolf
monkey
etc
these
are
forms
of
common
usage
but
every
individual
is
accustomed
to
make
such
identifications
whenever
he
meets
with
any
strange
object
he
speaks
therefore
to
some
degree
in
images
and
if
his
auditor
is
not
aware
of
the
fact
he
can
not
understand
him
his
speaking
so
may
be
discovered
by
seeking
out
clearly
whether
and
what
things
were
new
and
foreign
to
the
speaker
when
this
is
learned
it
may
be
assumed
that
he
will
express
himself
in
images
when
considering
the
unfamiliar
object
then
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
discover
the
nature
and
source
of
the
images
similar
difficulties
arise
with
the
usage
of
foreign
terms
it
is
of
course
familiar
that
their
incorrect
use
is
not
confined
to
the
uneducated
i
have
in
mind
particularly
the
weakening
of
the
meaning
in
our
own
language
the
foreign
word
according
to
volkmar
gets
its
significance
by
robbing
the
homonymous
native
word
of
its
definiteness
and
freshness
and
is
therefore
sought
out
by
all
persons
who
are
unwilling
to
call
things
by
their
right
names
the
is
far
from
being
so
sad
as
the
position
i
should
like
to
know
how
a
great
many
people
could
speak
if
they
were
not
permitted
to
say
words
by
means
of
which
they
reduce
the
values
of
the
terms
at
least
a
degree
in
intensity
of
meaning
the
reason
for
the
use
of
these
words
is
not
always
the
unwillingness
of
the
speaker
to
make
use
of
the
right
term
but
really
because
it
is
necessary
to
indicate
various
degrees
of
intensity
for
the
same
thing
without
making
use
of
attributes
or
other
extensions
of
the
term
thus
the
foreign
word
is
in
some
degree
introduced
as
a
technical
expression
the
direction
in
which
the
native
word
weakens
however
taken
as
that
is
intended
by
the
individual
who
uses
its
substitute
is
in
no
sense
universally
fixated
the
matter
is
entirely
one
of
individual
usage
and
must
be
examined
afresh
in
each
particular
case
the
striving
for
abbreviated
forms
of
expression
extraordinary
enough
in
our
gossipy
times
manifests
itself
in
still
another
direction
on
my
table
there
is
an
old
family
journal
cliff
to
what
should
the
title
mean
obviously
the
spatial
distribution
of
the
subject
of
its
contents
and
its
subscribers
about
the
whole
earth
or
all
lands
and
all
but
such
titles
would
be
too
long
hence
they
are
synthesized
into
cliff
to
sea
without
the
consideration
that
cliffs
often
stand
right
at
the
edge
of
the
sea
so
that
the
distance
between
them
may
be
only
the
thickness
of
a
hair
cliff
and
sea
are
not
local
opposites
or
my
son
enters
and
tells
me
a
story
about
an
by
he
means
an
old
student
who
has
spent
many
terms
at
least
more
than
are
required
or
necessary
at
the
university
as
this
explanation
is
too
long
the
whole
complex
is
contracted
into
semester
which
is
comfortable
but
unintelligible
to
all
people
not
associated
with
the
university
these
abbreviations
are
much
more
numerous
than
as
a
rule
they
are
supposed
to
be
and
must
always
be
explained
if
errors
are
to
be
avoided
nor
are
silent
and
monosyllabic
persons
responsible
for
them
gossipy
individuals
seek
by
the
use
of
them
to
exhibit
a
certain
power
of
speech
nor
is
it
indifferent
to
expression
when
people
in
an
apparently
nowise
comfortable
fashion
give
approximate
circumlocutive
figures
four
syllables
instead
of
the
monosyllable
or
bell
in
the
dome
at
has
as
many
nicks
as
the
year
has
days
etc
it
must
be
assumed
that
these
circumlocutive
expressions
are
chosen
either
because
of
the
desire
to
make
an
assertion
general
or
because
of
the
desire
for
some
mnemonic
aid
it
is
necessary
to
be
cautious
with
such
statements
either
because
as
made
they
only
the
figures
or
because
the
reliability
of
the
aid
to
memory
must
first
be
tested
finally
it
is
that
foreign
words
are
often
changed
into
senseless
words
of
a
similar
sound
when
such
unintelligible
words
are
heard
very
loud

of

of
the
most
difficult

the

with
a
girl
before
puberty
he
is
not
without
some
point
of
approach
for
his
judgment
since
boys
and
girls
are
at
that
period
not
so
essentially
different
as
to
prevent
the
drawing
of
analogous
inferences
by
the
comparison
of
his
own
childhood
with
that
of
the
girl
but
to
the
nature
of
woman
we
men
totally
lack
avenues
of
approach
we
can
find
no
parallel
between
women
and
ourselves
and
the
greatest
mistakes
in
criminal
law
were
made
where
the
conclusions
would
have
been
correct
if
the
woman
had
been
a
man
we
have
always
estimated
the
deeds
and
statements
of
women
by
the
same
standards
as
those
of
men
and
we
have
always
been
wrong
that
woman
is
different
from
man
is
testified
to
by
the
anatomist
the
physician
the
historian
the
theologian
the
philosopher
every
layman
sees
it
for
himself
woman
is
different
in
appearance
in
manner
of
observation
of
judgment
of
sensation
of
desire
of
efficacy
but
we
lawyers
punish
the
crimes
of
woman
as
we
do
those
of
man
and
we
count
her
testimony
as
we
do
that
of
man
the
present
age
is
trying
to
set
aside
the
differences
in
sex
and
to
level
them
but
it
forgets
that
the
law
of
causation
is
valid
here
also
woman
and
man
have
different
bodies
hence
they
must
have
different
minds
but
even
when
we
understand
this
we
proceed
wrongly
in
the
valuation
of
woman
we
can
not
attain
proper
knowledge
of
her
because
we
men
were
never
women
and
women
can
never
tell
us
the
truth
because
they
were
never
men
just
as
a
man
is
unable
to
discover
whether
he
and
his
neighbor
call
the
same
color
red
so
eternally
will
the
source
of
the
indubitably
existent
differences
in
the
psychic
life
of
male
and
female
be
undiscovered
but
if
we
can
not
learn
to
understand
the
essence
of
the
problem
of
the
eternal
feminine
we
may
at
least
study
its
manifestations
and
hope
to
find
as
much
clearness
as
the
difficulty
of
the
subject
will
permit
an
essential
i
might
say
unscientific
experience
seems
to
come
to
our
aid
here
in
this
matter
we
trust
the
real
researches
the
determinations
of
scholars
much
less
than
the
conviction
of
the
people
which
is
expressed
in
maxims
legal
differences
usage
and
proverbs
we
instinctively
feel
that
the
popular
conception
presents
the
experience
of
many
hundreds
of
years
experiences
of
both
men
and
women
so
that
we
may
assume
that
the
mistakes
of
the
observations
of
individuals
have
corrected
each
other
as
far
as
has
been
possible
and
yield
a
kind
of
average
result
now
even
if
averages
are
almost
always
wrong
either
because
they
appear
too
high
or
too
low
the
mistake
is
not
more
than
half
a
mistake
if
in
a
series
of
numbers
the
lowest
was
the
highest
and
the
average
and
if
i
take
the
latter
for
the
individual
problem
i
can
at
most
have
been
mistaken
about
four
never
about
eight
as
would
have
been
the
case
if
i
had
taken
or
for
each
other
the
attitude
of
the
people
gives
us
an
average
and
we
may
at
least
assume
that
it
would
not
have
maintained
itself
either
as
common
law
or
as
proverb
if
centuries
had
not
shown
that
the
mistake
involved
was
not
a
very
great
one
in
any
event
the
popular
method
was
comparatively
simple
no
delicate
distinctions
were
developed
a
general
norm
of
valuation
was
applied
to
woman
and
the
result
showed
that
woman
is
simply
a
less
worthy
creature
this
conception
we
find
very
early
in
the
history
of
the
most
civilized
peoples
as
well
as
among
contemporary
backward
nations
and
tribes
if
now
we
generally
assume
that
the
culture
of
a
people
and
the
position
of
its
women
have
the
same
measure
it
follows
only
that
increasing
education
revealed
that
the
simple
assumption
of
the
inferiority
of
woman
was
not
correct
that
the
essential
difference
in
psyche
between
man
and
woman
could
not
be
determined
and
that
even
today
the
old
conception
half
unconsciously
exercises
an
influence
on
our
valuation
of
woman
when
in
any
respect
we
are
required
to
judge
her
hence
we
are
in
no
wise
interested
in
the
degree
of
subordination
of
woman
among
savage
and
peoples
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
not
indifferent
for
us
to
know
what
the
situation
was
among
peoples
and
times
who
have
influenced
our
own
culture
let
us
review
the
situation
hastily
a
number
of
classical
instances
which
are
brought
together
by
fink
and
smith
show
how
little
the
classic
greek
thought
of
woman
and
becker
estimates
as
most
important
the
fact
that
the
greek
always
gave
precedence
to
children
and
said
œáŒ±·º±
the
greek
naturalists
hippocrates
and
aristotle
modestly
held
woman
to
be
half
human
and
even
the
poet
homer
is
not
free
from
this
point
of
view
cf
the
advice
of
agamemnon
to
odysseus
moreover
he
speaks
mostly
concerning
the
scandalmongering
and
lying
of
women
while
later
euripides
directly
reduces
the
status
of
women
to
the
minimum
cf
iphigenia
the
attention
of
ancient
rome
is
always
directed
upon
the
puzzling
unharmonious
qualities
in
woman
horace
gives
it
the
clearest
expression
in
piscem
mulier
formosa
the
orientals
have
not
done
any
better
for
us
the
chinese
assert
that
women
have
no
souls
the
mohammedan
believes
that
women
are
denied
entrance
to
paradise
and
the
koran
xliii
defines
the
woman
as
a
creature
which
grows
up
on
a
soil
of
finery
and
baubles
and
is
always
ready
to
nag
how
well
such
an
opinion
has
sustained
itself
is
shown
by
the
ottomanic
codex
according
to
which
the
testimony
of
two
women
is
worth
as
much
as
the
testimony
of
one
man
but
even
so
the
koran
has
a
higher
opinion
of
women
than
the
early
church
fathers
the
problem
mulier
habeat
animam
was
often
debated
at
the
councils
one
of
them
that
of
macon
dealt
earnestly
with
the
of
acidalius
homines
non
at
another
women
were
forbidden
to
touch
the
eucharist
with
bare
hands
this
attitude
is
implied
by
the
content
of
countless
numbers
of
evil
proverbs
which
deal
with
the
inferior
character
of
woman
and
certainly
by
the
circumstance
that
so
great
a
number
of
women
were
held
to
be
witches
of
whom
about
were
burned
in
germany
alone
the
statutes
dealt
with
women
only
in
so
far
as
their
trustworthiness
as
witnesses
could
be
depreciated
the
bambergensis
art
for
example
permits
the
admission
of
young
persons
and
women
only
in
special
cases
and
the
quarrels
of
the
older
lawyers
concerning
the
value
of
feminine
testimony
is
shown
by
mittermaier
if
we
discount
testimony
concerning
the
high
status
of
women
among
the
germanic
tribes
on
the
basis
that
he
aimed
at
shaming
and
reforming
his
countrymen
we
have
a
long
series
of
assertions
beginning
with
that
of
the
norseman
havam√°l
which
progressively
speaks
of
women
in
depreciatory
fashion
and
calls
them
inconstant
deceitful
and
stupefying
to
the
very
modern
maxim
which
brings
together
the
extreme
elevation
and
extreme
degradation
of
woman
the
woman
wings
and
she
is
either
an
angel
or
a
terse
as
this
expression
is
it
ought
to
imply
the
proper
point
of
view
women
are
either
superior
or
inferior
to
us
and
may
be
both
at
the
same
time
there
are
women
who
are
superior
and
there
are
women
who
are
inferior
and
further
a
single
woman
may
be
superior
to
us
in
some
qualities
and
inferior
in
others
but
she
is
not
like
us
in
any
the
statement
that
woman
is
as
complete
in
her
own
right
as
man
is
in
his
agrees
with
the
attitude
if
we
correlate
the
superiority
and
inferiority
of
women
with
we
judge
a
higher
or
lower
organism
from
our
standpoint
of
power
to
know
feel
and
do
but
we
judge
without
considering
whether
these
organisms
imply
or
not
the
purposes
we
assume
for
them
thus
a
uniform
monotonous
task
which
is
easy
but
requires
uninterrupted
attention
can
be
better
performed
by
an
average
patient
unthinking
individual
than
by
a
genial
fiery
intellect
the
former
is
much
more
to
the
purpose
of
this
work
than
the
latter
but
he
does
not
stand
higher
the
case
is
so
with
woman
for
many
of
the
purposes
assigned
to
her
she
is
better
constructed
but
whether
this
construction
from
our
standpoint
of
knowing
and
feeling
is
to
be
regarded
as
higher
or
lower
is
another
question
hence
we
are
only
in
a
sense
correct
when
calling
some
feminine
trait
which
does
not
coincide
with
our
own
a
poorer
inferior
quality
we
are
likely
to
overlook
the
fact
that
this
quality
taken
in
itself
is
the
right
one
for
the
nature
and
the
tasks
of
woman
whereas
we
ought
with
the
modern
naturalist
assume
that
every
animal
has
developed
correctly
for
its
own
purposes
if
this
were
not
the
case
with
woman
she
would
be
the
first
exception
to
the
laws
of
natural
evolution
hence
our
task
is
not
to
seek
out
peculiarities
and
rarities
in
woman
but
to
study
her
status
and
function
as
given
her
by
nature
then
we
shall
see
that
what
we
would
otherwise
have
called
extraordinary
appears
as
natural
necessity
of
course
many
of
the
feminine
qualities
will
not
bring
us
back
to
the
position
which
has
required
them
then
we
may
or
may
not
be
able
to
infer
it
according
to
the
laws
of
general
but
whether
we
establish
anything
directly
or
indirectly
must
be
for
the
time
indifferent
we
do
know
the
fact
before
us
if
we
find
only
the
pelvis
of
a
human
skeleton
we
should
be
able
to
infer
from
its
broad
form
that
it
belonged
to
a
woman
and
should
be
able
to
ground
this
inference
on
the
business
of
reproduction
which
is
but
we
shall
also
be
able
although
we
have
only
the
pelvis
before
us
to
make
reliable
statements
concerning
the
position
of
the
bones
of
the
lower
extremities
of
individual
and
we
shall
be
able
to
say
just
what
the
form
of
the
thorax
and
the
curve
of
the
vertebral
column
were
this
also
we
shall
have
in
our
power
more
or
less
to
ground
on
the
function
of
woman
but
we
might
go
still
further
and
say
that
this
individual
who
according
to
its
pelvic
cavity
was
a
woman
must
have
had
a
comparatively
smaller
skull
and
although
we
can
not
correlate
the
present
mark
with
the
function
or
any
other
special
characteristic
of
woman
we
may
yet
infer
it
safely
because
we
know
that
this
smaller
skull
capacity
stands
in
regular
relation
to
the
broad
pelvis
etc
in
a
like
manner
it
will
be
possible
to
bring
together
collectively
various
psychical
differences
of
woman
to
define
a
number
of
them
as
directly
necessary
and
to
deduce
another
number
from
their
regular
the
certainty
here
will
be
the
same
as
in
the
former
case
and
once
it
is
attained
we
shall
be
able
satisfactorily
to
interpret
the
conduct
of
woman
before
turning
to
feminine
psychology
i
should
like
briefly
to
touch
upon
the
use
of
the
literature
in
our
question
and
indicate
that
the
results
are
not
good
for
us
so
long
as
we
are
trying
to
satisfy
our
particular
legal
needs
we
might
of
course
refer
to
the
poet
for
information
concerning
the
feminine
heart
most
important
property
but
the
historically
famous
knowers
of
the
heart
leave
us
in
the
lurch
and
even
lead
us
into
decided
errors
we
are
not
here
concerned
with
the
history
of
literature
nor
with
the
solution
of
the
riddle
of
woman
we
are
lawyers
who
seek
to
avoid
mistakes
at
the
expense
of
the
honor
and
liberty
of
others
and
if
we
do
not
want
to
believe
the
poets
it
is
only
because
of
many
costly
mistakes
once
we
were
all
young
and
had
ideals
what
the
poets
told
us
we
supposed
to
be
the
wisdom
of
life
nobody
else
ever
offers
any
and
we
wanted
compulsorily
to
solve
the
most
urgent
of
human
problems
with
our
poetical
views
illusions
mistakes
and
guiltless
remorse
were
the
consequence
of
this
work
of
course
i
do
not
mean
to
drag
our
poets
to
court
and
accuse
them
of
seducing
our
youth
with
false
gods
i
am
convinced
that
if
the
poets
were
asked
they
would
tell
us
that
their
poetry
was
intended
for
all
save
for
physicians
and
criminalists
but
it
is
conceivable
that
they
have
introduced
points
of
view
that
do
not
imply
real
life
poetical
forms
do
not
grow
up
naturally
and
then
suddenly
come
together
in
a
idea
the
poet
creates
the
idea
first
and
in
order
that
this
may
be
so
the
individual
form
must
evolve
according
to
sense
the
more
natural
and
inevitable
this
process
becomes
the
better
the
poem
but
it
does
not
follow
that
since
we
do
not
doubt
it
because
it
seems
so
natural
it
mirrors
the
process
of
life
not
one
of
us
criminalists
has
ever
seen
a
form
as
described
in
a
poem
least
of
all
a
woman
obviously
in
our
serious
and
dry
work
we
may
be
able
to
interpret
many
an
observation
and
assertion
of
the
poet
as
a
golden
truth
but
only
when
we
have
tested
its
correctness
for
the
daily
life
but
it
must
be
understood
that
i
am
not
saying
here
that
we
ourselves
might
have
been
able
to
make
the
observation
or
to
abstract
a
truth
from
the
flux
of
appearances
or
at
least
to
set
it
in
beautiful
terse
and
i
might
say
convincing
form
i
merely
assert
that
we
must
be
permitted
to
examine
whether
what
has
been
beautifully
said
may
be
generalized
and
whether
we
then
have
found
the
same
or
a
similar
thing
in
the
daily
life
paradoxical
as
it
sounds
we
must
never
forget
that
there
is
a
kind
of
evidentiality
in
the
form
of
beauty
itself
one
of
remarkable
psalms
begins
wander
round
the
earth
earths
round
suns
the
whole
host
of
suns
wander
round
a
greater
sun
our
father
that
art
in
this
inexpressibly
lofty
verse
there
is
essentially
and
only
in
an
extremely
intensified
fashion
evidence
of
the
existence
of
god
and
if
the
convinced
atheist
should
read
this
verse
he
would
at
least
for
the
moment
believe
in
his
existence
at
the
same
time
a
real
development
of
evidence
is
neither
presented
nor
intended
there
are
magnificent
images
unassailable
true
propositions
the
moon
goes
round
about
the
earth
the
earth
about
the
sun
the
whole
system
around
a
central
sun
and
now
without
anything
else
the
fourth
proposition
concerning
the
identity
of
the
central
sun
with
our
heavenly
father
is
added
as
true
and
the
reader
is
captivated
for
at
least
a
minute
what
i
have
tried
here
to
show
by
means
of
a
drastic
example
occurs
many
times
in
poems
and
is
especially
evident
where
woman
is
the
subject
so
that
we
may
unite
in
believing
that
the
poet
can
not
teach
us
that
subject
that
he
may
only
lead
us
into
errors
to
learn
about
the
nature
of
woman
and
its
difference
from
that
of
man
we
must
drop
everything
poetical
most
conscientiously
we
must
drop
all
cynicism
and
seek
to
find
illumination
only
in
serious
disciplines
these
disciplines
may
be
universal
history
and
the
history
of
culture
but
certainly
not
memoirs
which
always
represent
subjective
experience
and
views
anatomy
physiology
anthropology
and
serious
special
literature
presupposed
may
give
us
an
unprejudiced
outlook
and
then
with
much
effort
we
may
observe
compare
and
renew
our
tests
of
what
has
been
established

and
is
approximately
true
if
you
accept
his
point
of
view
i
do
not
believe
that
these
explanations
would
help
anybody
or
make
it
easier
for
him
to
understand
woman
indeed
to
many
a
man
they
will
appear
to
be
saying
merely
that
the
psyche
of
the
male
is
masculine
that
of
the
female
feminine
the
thing
is
not
to
be
done
with
epigrams
however
spirited
epigrams
merely
tend
to
increase
the
already
great
confusion
hardly
more
help
toward
understanding
the
subject
is
to
be
derived
from
certain
expressions
which
deal
with
a
determinate
and
also
with
a
determining
trait
of
woman
for
example
the
saying
forbidden
ground
woman
is
cautious
and
man
keen
may
under
some
circumstances
be
of
great
importance
in
a
criminal
case
particularly
when
it
is
necessary
to
fix
the
sex
of
the
criminal
if
the
crime
was
cautiously
committed
a
woman
may
be
inferred
and
if
swiftly
a
man
but
that
maxim
is
deficient
in
two
respects
man
and
woman
deal
in
the
way
described
not
only
in
forbidden
fields
but
generally
again
such
characteristics
may
be
said
to
be
ordinary
but
in
no
wise
regulative
there
are
enough
cases
in
which
the
woman
was
much
keener
than
the
man
and
the
man
much
more
cautious
than
the
woman
the
greatest
danger
of
false
conceptions
lies
in
the
attribution
of
an
unproved
peculiarity
to
woman
by
means
of
some
beautifully
expressed
and
hence
apparently
true
proverb
consider
the
well
known
maxim
man
forgives
a
beautiful
woman
everything
woman
nothing
taken
in
itself
the
thing
is
true
we
find
it
in
the
gossip
of
the
and
in
the
most
dreadful
of
criminal
cases
men
are
inclined
to
reduce
the
conduct
of
a
beautiful
sinner
to
the
mildest
and
least
offensive
terms
while
her
own
sex
judge
her
the
more
harshly
in
the
degree
of
her
beauty
and
the
number
of
its
partisans
now
it
might
be
easy
in
an
attempt
to
draw
the
following
consequences
from
the
correctness
of
this
proposition
men
are
generally
inclined
to
forgive
in
kindness
women
are
the
unforgiving
creatures
this
inference
would
be
altogether
unjustified
for
the
maxim
only
incidentally
has
woman
for
its
subject
it
might
as
well
read
woman
forgives
a
handsome
man
everything
man
nothing
what
we
have
at
work
here
is
the
not
particularly
remarkable
fact
that
envy
plays
a
great
r√¥le
in
life
another
difficulty
in
making
use
of
popular
truths
in
our
own
observations
lies
in
their
being
expressed
in
more
or
less
definite
images
if
you
say
for
example
begs
with
words
woman
with
glances
you
have
a
proposition
that
might
be
of
use
in
many
criminal
cases
inasmuch
as
things
frequently
depend
on
the
demonstration
that
there
was
or
was
not
an
amour
between
two
people
murder
of
a
husband
relation
of
the
widow
with
a
suspect
now
of
course
the
judge
could
not
see
how
they
conversed
together
how
he
spoke
stormily
and
she
turned
her
eyes
away
but
suppose
that
the
judge
has
gotten
hold
of
some
letters
then
if
he
makes
use
of
the
maxim
he
will
observe
that
the
man
becomes
more
explicit
than
the
woman
who
up
to
a
certain
limit
remains
ashamed
so
if
the
man
speaks
very
definitely
in
his
letters
there
is
no
evidence
contradictory
to
the
inference
of
their
relationship
even
though
nothing
similar
is
to
be
found
in
her
letters
the
thing
may
be
expressed
in
another
maxim
what
he
wants
is
in
the
lines
what
she
wants
between
the
lines
the
great
difficulty
of
distinguishing
between
man
and
woman
is
mentioned
in
oder
erziehungslehre
by
jean
paul
who
says
woman
can
not
love
her
child
and
the
four
continents
of
the
world
at
the
same
time
a
man
but
who
has
ever
seen
a
man
love
four
continents
loves
the
concept
she
the
appearance
the
what
lawyer
understands
this
and
this
long
as
woman
loves
she
loves
continuously
but
man
has
lucid
this
fact
has
been
otherwise
expressed
by
grabbe
who
says
man
the
world
is
his
heart
for
woman
her
heart
is
the
and
what
are
we
to
learn
from
this
that
the
love
of
woman
is
greater
and
fills
her
life
more
certainly
not
we
only
see
that
man
has
more
to
do
than
woman
and
this
prevents
him
from
depending
on
his
impressions
so
that
he
can
not
allow
himself
to
be
completely
captured
by
even
his
intense
inclinations
hence
the
old
proverb
every
new
affection
makes
man
more
foolish
and
woman
wiser
meaning
that
man
is
held
back
from
his
work
and
effectiveness
by
every
inclination
while
woman
each
time
gathers
new
experiences
in
life
of
course
man
also
gets
a
few
of
these
but
he
has
other
and
more
valuable
opportunities
of
getting
them
while
woman
who
has
not
his
position
in
the
midst
of
life
must
gather
her
experiences
where
she
may
hence
it
remains
best
to
stick
to
simple
sober
discoveries
which
may
be
described
without
literary
glamour
and
which
admit
of
no
exception
such
is
the
statement
by
friedreich
is
more
excitable
more
volatile
and
movable
spiritually
than
man
the
mind
dominates
the
latter
the
emotions
the
former
man
thinks
more
woman
senses
these
ungarnished
clear
words
which
offer
nothing
new
still
contain
as
much
as
may
be
said
and
explained
we
may
perhaps
supplement
them
with
an
expression
of
have
much
reproductive
but
little
productive
imaginative
power
hence
there
are
good
landscape
and
portrait
painters
among
women
but
as
long
as
women
have
painted
there
has
not
been
any
great
of
history
they
make
poems
romances
and
sonnets
but
not
one
of
them
has
written
a
good
this
expression
shows
that
the
imaginative
power
of
woman
is
really
more
reproductive
than
productive
and
it
may
be
so
observed
in
crimes
and
in
the
testimony
of
witnesses
in
crimes
this
fact
will
not
be
easy
to
observe
in
the
deed
itself
or
in
the
manner
of
its
execution
it
will
be
observable
in
the
nature
of
the
plan
used
to
say
that
the
plan
indicates
productive
creation
would
not
be
to
call
it
original
originality
can
not
be
indicated
without
danger
of
misunderstanding
by
means
of
even
a
single
example
we
have
simply
to
cling
to
the
paradigm
of
heusinger
and
to
say
that
when
the
plan
of
a
criminal
act
appears
more
independent
and
more
completely
worked
out
it
may
be
assumed
to
be
of
masculine
origin
if
it
seeks
support
however
if
it
is
an
imitation
of
what
has
already
happened
if
it
aims
to
find
outside
assistance
during
its
execution
its
originator
was
a
woman
this
truth
goes
so
far
that
in
the
latter
case
the
woman
must
be
fixed
upon
as
the
intellectual
source
of
the
plan
even
though
the
criminal
actually
was
a
man
the
converse
inference
could
hardly
be
held
with
justice
if
a
man
has
thought
out
a
plan
which
a
woman
is
to
execute
its
fundamental
lines
are
wiped
out
and
the
woman
permits
the
productive
aspect
of
the
matter
to
disappear
or
to
become
so
indefinite
that
any
sure
conclusion
on
the
subject
is
impossible
our
phenomenon
is
equally
important
in
statements
by
witnesses
in
many
a
case
in
which
we
suppose
the
whole
or
a
portion
of
a
testimony
to
be
incorrect
intentionally
invented
or
involuntarily
imagined
we
may
succeed
in
extracting
a
part
of
the
testimony
as
independent
construction
and
thus
determining
what
might
be
incorrect
in
it
if
when
this
happens
the
witness
is
a
man
and
his
lies
show
themselves
in
productive
form
and
if
the
witness
is
a
woman
and
her
lies
appear
to
be
reproduced
it
is
possible
at
least
that
we
are
being
told
untruths
the
procedure
obviously
does
not
in
itself
contain
anything
evidential
but
it
may
at
least
excite
suspicion
and
thus
caution
and
that
in
many
cases
is
enough
i
may
say
of
my
own
work
that
i
have
often
gained
much
advantage
from
this
method
if
there
were
any
suspicion
that
the
testimony
of
a
witness
especially
the
conception
of
some
committed
crime
was
untrue
i
recalled
heusinger
and
asked
myself
the
thing
is
untrue
is
it
a
sonnet
or
a
tragedy
if
the
answer
was
and
the
witness
a
man
or
if
the
answer
was
and
the
witness
a
woman
i
concluded
that
everything
was
possibly
invented
and
grew
quite
cautious
if
i
could
come
to
no
conclusion
i
was
considerably
helped
by
other
proposition
asking
myself
or
historical
subjects
and
here
again
i
found
something
to
go
by
and
the
need
to
be
suspicious
i
repeat
no
evidence
is
to
be
attained
in
this
way
but
we
frequently
win
when
we
are
warned
beforehand
section
a
general
considerations
even
if
we
know
that
hunger
and
love
are
not
the
only
things
that
sustain
impulse
we
also
know
the
profound
influence
that
love
and
all
that
depends
upon
it
exercise
from
time
immemorial
on
the
course
of
events
this
being
generally
true
the
question
of
the
influence
of
sex
on
woman
is
more
important
than
that
of
its
influence
on
man
for
a
large
number
of
profound
conditions
are
at
work
in
the
former
which
are
absent
in
the
latter
hence
it
is
in
no
way
sufficient
to
consider
only
the
physiological
traits
of
the
somatic
life
of
woman
menstruation
pregnancy
the
suckling
period
and
finally
the
climacterium
we
must
study
also
the
possibly
still
more
important
psychical
conditions
which
spring
from
the
feminine
nature
and
are
developed
by
the
demands
of
civilization
and
custom
we
must
ask
what
it
means
to
character
when
an
individual
is
required
from
the
moment
puberty
begins
to
conceal
something
for
a
few
days
every
month
what
it
means
when
this
secrecy
is
maintained
for
a
long
time
during
pregnancy
at
least
toward
children
and
the
younger
people
nor
can
it
be
denied
that
the
custom
which
demands
more
in
women
must
exercise
a
formative
influence
on
their
natures
our
views
do
not
permit
the
woman
to
show
without
great
indirection
whom
she
hates
or
whom
she
likes
nor
may
she
indicate
clearly
whom
she
loves
nor
must
she
appear
solicitous
everything
must
happen
indirectly
secretly
and
approximately
and
if
this
need
is
inherited
for
centuries
it
must
as
a
characteristic
impart
a
definite
expression
to
the
sex
this
expression
is
of
great
importance
to
the
criminalist
it
is
often
enough
to
recall
these
circumstances
in
order
to
find
explanation
for
a
whole
series
of
phenomena
what
differences
the
modern
point
of
view
and
modern
tendencies
will
make
remains
to
be
seen
let
us
now
consider
particular
characteristics
section
b
menstruation
we
men
in
our
own
life
have
no
analogy
not
even
a
remote
one
to
this
essentially
feminine
process
in
the
mental
life
of
woman
it
is
of
greater
importance
than
we
are
accustomed
to
suppose
in
most
cases
in
which
it
may
be
felt
that
the
fact
of
menstruation
influences
a
crime
or
a
statement
of
facts
it
will
be
necessary
to
make
use
of
the
court
physician
who
must
report
to
the
judge
the
latter
absolutely
must
understand
the
fact
and
influence
of
menstruation
of
course
he
must
also
have
general
knowledge
of
the
whole
matter
but
he
must
require
the
court
physician
definitely
to
tell
him
when
the
event
began
and
whether
any
diseased
conditions
were
apparent
then
it
is
the
business
of
the
judge
to
interpret
the
report
psychologically
and
the
judge
knows
neither
more
nor
less
psychology
according
to
his
training
than
the
physician
any
on
physiology
will
give
the
important
facts
about
menstruation
it
is
important
for
us
to
know
that
menses
begin
in
our
climate
from
the
thirteenth
to
the
fifteenth
year
and
end
between
the
and
the
fiftieth
year
the
periods
are
normally
a
solar
month
from
to
days
and
the
menstruation
lasts
from
three
to
five
days
after
its
conclusion
the
sexual
impulse
even
in
otherwise
frigid
women
is
in
most
cases
intensified
it
is
important
moreover
to
note
the
fact
that
most
women
during
their
periods
show
a
not
insignificant
alteration
of
their
mental
lives
often
exhibiting
states
of
mind
that
are
otherwise
foreign
to
them
as
in
many
cases
it
is
impossible
without
other
justification
to
ask
whether
menses
have
begun
it
is
worth
while
knowing
that
most
women
menstruate
according
to
some
authorities
during
the
first
quarter
of
the
moon
and
that
only
a
few
menstruate
during
the
new
or
full
moon
the
facts
are
very
questionable
but
we
have
no
other
cues
for
determining
that
menstruation
is
taking
place
either
the
popularly
credited
signs
of
it
a
particular
appearance
a
significant
shining
of
the
eyes
bad
odor
from
the
mouth
or
susceptibility
to
perspiration
are
unreliable
or
there
are
such
signs
as
feeling
unwell
tension
in
the
back
fatigue
in
the
bones
which
are
much
more
simply
and
better
discovered
by
direct
interrogation
or
examination
by
a
physician
if
there
is
any
suspicion
that
menstruation
has
influenced
testimony
or
a
crime
and
if
the
other
especially
the
facts
are
not
against
it
we
are
called
upon
to
decide
whether
we
are
considering
a
mental
event
due
to
the
influence
of
menstruation
icard
has
written
the
best
monograph
on
this
subject
considering
the
matter
in
detail
our
attention
is
first
called
to
the
importance
of
the
beginning
of
menstruation
never
is
a
girl
more
tender
or
quiet
never
more
spiritual
and
attractive
nor
more
inclined
to
good
sense
than
in
the
beginning
of
puberty
generally
a
little
before
the
menstrual
periods
have
begun
or
have
become
properly
ordered
at
this
time
then
the
danger
that
the
young
girl
may
commit
a
crime
is
very
small
perhaps
smaller
than
at
any
other
time
and
hence
it
is
the
more
to
be
feared
that
such
a
creature
may
become
the
victim
of
the
passions
of
a
rou√©
or
may
cause
herself
the
greatest
harm
by
mistaken
conduct
this
is
the
more
possible
when
the
circumstances
are
such
that
the
child
has
little
to
do
though
naturally
gifted
unused
spiritual
qualities
ennui
waking
sensitivity
and
charm
make
a
dangerous
mixture
which
is
expressed
as
a
form
of
interest
in
exciting
experiences
in
the
romantic
or
at
least
the
unusual
sexual
things
are
perhaps
wholly
or
partly
not
understood
but
their
excitation
is
present
and
the
results
are
the
harmless
dreams
of
extraordinary
experiences
the
danger
is
in
these
for
from
them
may
arise
fantasies
insufficiently
justified
principles
and
inclination
to
deceit
then
all
the
prerequirements
are
present
which
give
rise
to
those
cases
of
unjust
complaints
false
testimony
about
seduction
rape
attempts
at
rape
and
even
arson
accusing
letters
and
slander
every
one
of
us
is
sufficiently
familiar
with
such
accusations
every
one
of
us
knows
how
frequently
we
can
not
sufficiently
marvel
how
such
and
such
an
otherwise
quiet
honest
and
peaceful
girl
could
perform
things
so
incomprehensible
if
an
investigation
had
been
made
to
see
whether
the
feat
did
not
occur
at
the
time
of
her
first
mensis
if
the
girl
had
been
watched
during
her
next
mensis
to
determine
whether
some
fresh
significant
alteration
occurred
the
police
physician
might
possibly
have
been
able
to
explain
the
event
i
know
many
cases
of
crimes
committed
by
girls
who
would
under
no
circumstances
have
been
accused
of
them
among
them
arson
lese
majeste
the
writing
of
numerous
anonymous
letters
and
a
slander
by
way
of
complaining
of
a
completely
fanciful
seduction
in
one
of
these
cases
we
succeeded
in
showing
that
the
girl
in
question
had
committed
her
crime
at
the
time
of
her
first
mensis
that
she
was
otherwise
quiet
and
well
conducted
and
that
she
showed
at
her
next
mensis
some
degree
of
significant
unrest
and
excitement
as
soon
as
the
menses
got
their
proper
adjustment
not
one
of
the
earlier
phenomena
could
be
observed
and
the
child
exhibited
no
further
inclination
to
commit
crimes
creatures
like
her
undergo
similar
danger
when
they
have
to
make
statements
about
perceptions
which
are
either
interesting
in
themselves
or
have
occurred
in
an
interesting
way
here
caution
must
be
exercised
in
two
directions
first
discover
whether
the
child
in
question
was
passing
through
her
monthly
period
at
the
time
when
she
saw
the
event
under
discussion
or
when
she
was
telling
about
it
in
the
former
case
she
has
told
of
more
than
could
have
been
perceived
in
the
second
case
she
develops
the
delusion
that
she
had
seen
more
than
she
really
had
how
unreliable
the
testimony
of
youthful
girls
is
and
what
mistakes
it
has
caused
are
familiar
facts
but
too
little
attention
is
paid
to
the
fact
that
this
unreliability
is
not
permanent
with
the
individuals
and
in
most
cases
changes
into
complete
trustworthiness
as
a
rule
the
criminal
judge
is
almost
never
in
a
position
to
determine
the
inconsistencies
in
the
testimony
of
a
menstruating
girl
inasmuch
as
he
sees
her
at
most
just
a
few
times
and
can
not
at
those
times
observe
differences
in
her
love
for
truth
fortunately
the
statements
of
newly
menstruating
girls
when
untrue
are
very
characteristic
and
present
themselves
in
the
form
of
something
essentially
romantic
extraordinary
and
interesting
if
we
find
this
tendency
of
transforming
simple
daily
events
into
extraordinary
experiences
then
if
the
testimony
of
the
girl
does
not
agree
with
that
of
other
witnesses
we
are
warned
still
greater
assurance
is
easy
to
gain
by
examining
persons
who
know
the
girl
well
on
her
trustworthiness
and
love
of
truth
before
this
time
if
their
statements
intensify
the
suspicion
that
menses
have
been
an
influence
it
is
not
too
much
to
ask
directly
to
and
if
necessary
to
call
in
medical
aid
in
order
to
ascertain
the
truth
the
direct
question
is
in
a
characteristically
great
number
of
cases
answered
falsely
if
in
such
cases
we
learn
that
the
observation
was
made
or
the
testimony
given
at
the
menstrual
period
we
may
assume
it
probably
justifiable
to
suspect
great
exaggeration
if
not
pure
invention
the
menstrual
period
tends
at
all
ages
from
the
youngest
child
to
the
woman
to
modify
the
quality
of
perception
and
the
truth
of
description
von
reichenbach
writes
that
sensitivity
is
intensified
during
the
menstrual
period
and
even
if
this
famous
discoverer
has
said
a
number
of
crazy
things
on
the
subject
his
record
is
such
that
he
must
be
regarded
as
a
clever
man
and
an
excellent
observer
there
is
no
doubt
that
his
sensitive
people
were
simply
very
nervous
individuals
who
reacted
vigorously
to
all
external
stimulations
and
inasmuch
as
his
views
agree
with
others
we
may
assume
that
his
observation
shows
at
least
how
emotional
excitable
and
inclined
to
fine
perceptions
menstruating
women
are
it
is
how
sharpened
becomes
under
certain
conditions
of
before
you
get
a
cold
in
the
head
the
sense
of
smell
is
regularly
intensified
certain
headaches
are
accompanied
with
an
intensification
of
hearing
so
that
we
are
disturbed
by
sounds
that
otherwise
we
should
not
hear
at
all
every
bruised
place
on
the
body
is
very
sensitive
to
touch
all
in
all
we
must
believe
that
the
senses
of
woman
especially
her
skin
sensations
the
sensations
of
touch
are
intensified
during
the
menstrual
period
for
at
that
time
her
body
is
in
a
of
this
fact
is
important
in
many
ways
it
is
not
improbable
that
one
menstruating
woman
shall
have
heard
seen
felt
and
smelt
things
which
others
and
she
herself
would
not
have
perceived
at
another
time
again
if
we
trace
back
many
a
conception
of
menstruating
women
we
learn
that
the
boundary
between
more
delicate
sensating
and
sensibility
can
not
be
easily
drawn
here
we
may
see
the
universal
transition
from
sensibility
to
acute
excitability
which
is
a
source
of
many
quarrels
the
witness
the
wounded
or
accused
are
all
to
a
considerable
degree
under
its
influence
it
is
a
generally
familiar
fact
that
the
incomparably
larger
number
of
complaints
of
attacks
on
honor
fall
through
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
just
how
such
complaints
of
menstruating
women
occur
of
course
nobody
can
determine
this
statistically
but
it
is
a
fact
that
such
trials
are
best
conducted
never
exactly
four
weeks
after
the
crime
nor
four
weeks
after
the
accusation
for
if
most
of
the
complaints
of
menstruating
women
are
made
at
the
period
of
their
menses
they
are
just
as
excited
four
weeks
later
and
opposed
to
every
attempt
at
adjustment
this
is
the
fundamental
principle
i
once
succeeded
by
its
use
in
helping
a
respectable
citizen
of
a
small
town
whose
wife
made
uninterrupted
complaints
of
inuriam
causa
and
got
the
answer
that
his
wife
was
an
excellent
soul
but
the
devil
in
her
during
her
monthlies
and
tries
to
find
occasions
for
quarrels
with
everybody
and
finds
herself
immediately
much
a
still
more
suspicious
quality
than
the
empty
capacity
for
anger
is
pointed
out
by
lombroso
who
says
that
woman
during
menstruation
is
inclined
to
anger
and
to
falsification
in
this
regard
lombroso
may
be
correct
inasmuch
as
the
lie
may
be
combined
with
the
other
qualities
here
observed
we
often
note
that
most
honorable
women
lie
in
the
most
shameless
fashion
if
we
find
no
other
motive
and
we
know
that
the
woman
periodically
gets
into
an
abnormal
condition
we
are
at
least
justified
in
the
presupposition
that
the
two
are
coordinate
and
that
the
periodic
condition
is
cause
of
the
otherwise
rare
feminine
lie
here
also
we
are
required
to
be
cautious
and
if
we
hear
significant
and
not
otherwise
confirmed
assertions
from
women
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
they
may
be
due
to
menstruation
but
we
may
go
still
further
du
saulle
asserts
on
the
basis
of
investigations
that
a
significant
number
of
thefts
in
parisian
shops
are
committed
frequently
by
the
most
elegant
ladies
during
their
menstrual
period
and
this
in
no
fewer
than
cases
out
of
while
more
cases
occurred
at
the
beginning
of
the
period
other
authorities
who
have
studied
this
matter
have
shown
how
the
presentation
of
objects
women
much
desire
leads
to
theft
grant
that
during
her
mensis
the
woman
is
in
a
more
excitable
and
less
actively
resisting
condition
and
it
may
follow
she
might
be
easily
overpowered
by
the
seductive
quality
of
pretty
jewelry
and
other
knickknacks
this
possibility
leads
us
however
to
remoter
conclusions
women
desire
more
than
merely
pretty
things
and
are
less
able
to
resist
their
desires
during
their
periods
if
they
are
less
able
to
resist
in
such
things
they
are
equally
less
able
to
resist
in
other
things
in
handling
those
thefts
which
were
formerly
called
kleptomaniac
and
which
in
spite
of
the
refusal
to
use
this
term
are
undeniable
it
is
customary
if
they
recur
repeatedly
to
see
whether
pregnancy
is
not
the
cause
it
is
well
to
consider
also
the
influence
of
menstruation
menstruation
may
bring
women
even
to
the
most
terrible
crimes
various
authors
cite
numerous
examples
in
which
otherwise
sensible
women
have
been
driven
to
the
most
inconceivable
things
in
many
cases
to
murder
certainly
such
crimes
will
be
much
more
numerous
if
the
abnormal
tendency
is
unknown
to
the
friends
of
the
woman
who
should
watch
her
carefully
during
this
short
dangerous
period
the
fact
is
familiar
that
the
disturbances
of
menstruation
lead
to
abnormal
psychoses
this
type
of
mental
disease
develops
so
quietly
that
in
numerous
cases
the
maladies
are
overlooked
and
hence
it
is
more
easily
possible
since
they
are
transitive
to
interpret
them
commonly
as
excitement
or
to
pay
no
attention
to
them
although
they
need
it
section
c
pregnancy
we
may
speak
of
the
conditions
and
effects
of
pregnancy
very
briefly
the
doubt
of
pregnancy
will
be
much
less
frequent
than
that
of
menstruation
for
the
powerful
influence
of
pregnancy
on
the
psychic
life
of
woman
is
and
it
is
hence
the
more
important
to
call
in
the
physician
in
cases
of
crimes
committed
by
pregnant
women
or
in
cases
of
important
testimony
to
be
given
by
such
women
but
indeed
the
frequently
obvious
remarkable
desires
the
significant
conduct
and
the
extraordinary
often
cruel
impulses
which
influence
pregnant
women
and
for
the
appearance
of
which
the
physician
is
to
be
called
in
are
not
the
only
thing
the
most
difficult
and
most
conditions
of
pregnancy
are
the
purely
psychical
ones
which
manifest
themselves
in
the
sometimes
slight
sometimes
more
obvious
alterations
in
the
point
of
view
and
capacity
for
producing
an
event
in
themselves
they
seem
of
little
importance
but
they
occasion
such
a
change
in
the
attitude
of
an
individual
toward
a
happening
which
she
must
describe
to
the
judge
that
the
change
may
cause
a
change
in
the
judgment
i
repeat
here
also
that
it
may
be
theoretically
said
witness
must
tell
us
facts
and
only
facts
but
this
is
not
really
so
quite
apart
from
the
fact
that
the
statement
of
any
perception
contains
a
judgment
it
depends
also
and
always
on
the
point
of
view
and
this
varies
with
the
emotional
state
if
then
we
have
never
experienced
any
of
the
emotional
alteration
to
which
a
pregnant
woman
is
subject
we
must
be
able
to
interpret
it
logically
in
order
to
hit
on
the
correct
thing
we
set
aside
the
altered
somatic
conditions
of
the
mother
the
disturbance
of
the
conditions
of
nutrition
and
circulation
we
need
clearly
to
understand
what
it
means
to
have
assumed
care
about
a
developing
creature
to
know
that
a
future
life
is
growing
up
fortunately
or
unfortunately
and
is
capable
of
bringing
joy
or
sorrow
weal
or
woe
to
its
parents
the
woman
knows
that
her
condition
is
an
endangerment
of
her
own
life
that
it
brings
at
least
pains
sufferings
and
difficulties
as
a
rule
by
the
pregnant
woman
involuntarily
she
feels
whether
she
be
educated
or
uneducated
the
secrecy
the
elusiveness
of
the
growing
life
she
bears
the
life
which
is
to
come
out
into
the
world
and
to
bring
its
into
jeopardy
thereby
she
feels
nearer
death
and
the
various
tendencies
which
are
attached
to
this
feeling
are
determined
by
the
nature
and
the
conditions
of
each
particular
future
sensations
how
different
may
be
the
feeling
of
a
poor
abandoned
bride
who
is
expecting
a
child
from
that
of
a
young
woman
who
knows
that
she
is
to
bring
into
the
world
the
heir
of
name
and
fortune
consider
the
difference
between
the
feeling
of
a
sickly
proletarian
richly
blessed
with
children
who
knows
that
the
new
child
is
an
unwelcome
superfluity
whose
birth
may
perhaps
rob
the
other
helpless
children
of
their
mother
with
the
feeling
of
a
comfortable
thoroughly
healthy
woman
who
finds
no
difference
between
having
three
or
having
four
children
and
if
these
feelings
are
various
must
they
not
be
so
intense
and
so
as
to
influence
the
attitude
of
the
woman
toward
some
event
she
has
observed
it
may
be
objected
that
the
subjective
attitude
of
a
witness
will
never
influence
a
judge
who
can
easily
discover
the
objective
truth
in
the
observation
of
an
event
but
let
us
not
deceive
ourselves
let
us
take
things
as
they
are
subjective
attitude
may
become
objective
falsehood
in
spite
of
the
best
endeavor
of
the
witness
and
the
examiner
may
fail
altogether
to
distinguish
between
what
is
truth
and
what
poetry
further
in
many
instances
the
witness
must
be
questioned
with
regard
to
the
impression
the
event
made
on
her
particularly
if
the
event
can
not
be
described
in
words
we
must
ask
whether
the
impression
was
that
an
attack
was
dangerous
a
threat
serious
a
blackmail
conceivable
a
brawl
intentional
a
gesture
insulting
an
assault
premeditated
in
these
and
thousands
of
other
cases
we
must
know
the
point
of
view
and
are
compelled
to
draw
our
deductions
from
it
and
finally
who
of
us
believes
himself
to
be
altogether
immune
to
emotional
induction
the
witness
describes
us
the
event
in
definite
tones
which
are
echoed
to
us
if
there
are
other
witnesses
the
incomplete
view
may
be
corrected
but
if
there
is
only
one
witness
or
one
whom
for
some
reason
we
believe
more
than
others
or
if
there
are
several
but
witnesses
the
condition
and
remain
inadequate
in
us
whoever
has
before
him
a
pregnant
woman
with
her
impressions
altered
in
a
thousand
ways
may
therefore
well
be
in
the
air
the
older
literature
which
develops
an
elaborate
casuistic
concerning
cases
in
which
pregnant
women
exhibited
especial
desires
or
abnormal
changes
in
their
perceptions
and
expressions
is
in
many
directions
of
considerable
importance
we
must
however
remember
that
the
old
observations
are
rarely
exact
and
were
always
made
with
less
knowledge
than
we
nowadays
possess
section
d
erotic
a
question
which
is
as
frequent
as
it
is
idle
concerns
the
degree
of
sexual
impulse
in
woman
it
is
important
for
the
lawyer
to
know
something
about
this
of
course
for
many
a
sexual
crime
may
be
more
properly
judged
if
it
is
known
how
far
the
woman
encouraged
the
man
and
in
similar
cases
the
knowledge
might
help
us
to
presume
what
attitude
feminine
witnesses
might
take
toward
the
matter
first
of
all
the
needs
of
individual
women
are
as
different
as
those
of
individual
men
and
as
varied
as
the
need
for
food
drink
warmth
rest
and
a
hundred
other
animal
requirements
we
shall
be
unable
to
find
any
standard
by
determining
even
an
average
it
is
useless
to
say
that
sexual
sensibility
is
less
in
woman
than
in
man
because
specialists
contradict
each
other
on
this
matter
we
are
not
aided
either
by
assertion
that
the
sensibility
is
less
than
the
irritability
in
woman
or
by
statement
that
women
rarely
have
such
powerful
sexual
desire
that
it
causes
them
pain
we
can
learn
here
also
only
by
means
of
the
interpretation
of
good
particular
observations
when
for
example
the
italian
positivists
repeatedly
assert
that
woman
is
less
erotic
and
more
sexual
they
mean
that
man
cares
more
about
the
satisfaction
of
the
sexual
impulse
woman
about
the
maternal
instinct
this
piece
of
information
may
help
us
to
explain
some
cases
at
least
we
shall
understand
many
a
mistake
without
needing
immediately
to
presuppose
rape
seduction
by
means
of
promises
of
marriage
etc
once
we
have
in
mind
soberly
what
fruits
dishonor
brings
to
a
girl
scorn
and
shame
the
difficulties
of
pregnancy
alienation
from
relatives
perhaps
even
banishment
from
the
paternal
home
perhaps
the
loss
of
a
good
position
then
the
pains
and
sorrows
of
care
of
the
child
reduction
of
earnings
difficulties
and
troubles
with
the
child
difficulties
in
going
about
less
prospect
of
care
through
wedlock
these
are
of
such
extraordinary
weight
that
it
is
impossible
to
adduce
so
elementary
a
force
to
the
sexual
impulse
as
to
enable
it
to
veil
the
outlook
upon
this
outcome
of
its
satisfaction
the
viennese
gynaecologist
braun
said
it
were
naturally
so
arranged
that
in
every
wedlock
man
must
bear
the
second
child
there
would
be
no
more
than
three
children
in
any
his
intention
is
that
even
if
the
woman
agrees
to
have
the
third
child
the
man
would
be
so
frightened
at
the
pains
of
the
first
that
he
never
again
would
permit
himself
to
bear
another
as
we
can
hardly
say
that
we
have
any
reason
for
asserting
that
the
sexual
needs
of
woman
are
essentially
greater
or
that
woman
is
better
able
to
bear
more
pain
than
man
we
are
compelled
to
believe
that
there
must
be
in
woman
an
impulse
lacking
in
man
this
impulse
must
be
supposed
to
be
so
powerful
that
it
subdues
let
us
say
briefly
all
the
fear
of
an
illegitimate
or
otherwise
undesirable
and
this
is
the
impulse
we
mean
by
sexuality
by
the
maternal
instinct
it
would
seem
as
if
nature
at
least
in
isolated
cases
desires
to
confirm
this
view
according
to
icard
there
are
women
who
have
children
simply
for
the
pleasure
of
suckling
them
the
suckling
being
a
pleasant
sensation
if
now
nature
has
produced
a
sexual
impulse
purely
for
the
sake
of
preserving
the
species
she
has
given
fuller
expression
to
sexuality
and
the
maternal
instinct
when
she
has
endowed
it
with
an
especial
impulse
in
at
least
a
few
definite
cases
this
impulse
will
explain
to
the
criminalist
a
large
number
of
phenomena
especially
the
accommodation
of
woman
to
desires
and
from
this
alone
he
may
deduce
a
number
of
otherwise
difficultly
explainable
psychical
phenomena
there
is
of
course
a
series
of
facts
which
deny
the
existence
of
this
impulse
but
they
only
seem
to
the
very
frequent
cruelty
of
mothers
to
their
children
the
opposition
of
very
young
women
to
bearing
and
bringing
up
children
cf
the
educated
among
french
and
american
women
and
similar
phenomena
seem
to
speak
against
the
maternal
instinct
we
must
not
forget
however
that
all
impulses
come
to
an
end
where
the
opposed
impulse
becomes
stronger
and
that
under
given
circumstances
even
the
most
powerful
impulse
that
of
may
be
opposed
all
actions
of
despair
tearing
the
beard
beating
hands
and
feet
together
rage
at
own
health
and
finally
suicide
may
ensue
if
the
mother
kills
her
own
child
this
action
belongs
to
the
same
series
as
through
despair
the
more
orderly
and
numerous
actions
and
feelings
in
this
direction
the
disinclination
of
women
toward
bearing
children
may
be
explained
also
by
the
fact
that
it
is
the
consequence
of
definite
conditions
of
civilization
if
we
recall
what
unnatural
senseless
and
half
crazy
habits
with
regard
to
nutrition
dressing
social
adjustments
civilization
and
fashion
have
forced
upon
us
we
do
not
need
to
adduce
real
perversity
in
order
to
understand
how
desire
for
comfort
how
laziness
and
the
scramble
for
wealth
lead
to
suppression
of
the
maternal
instinct
this
may
also
be
called
degeneration
there
are
still
other
less
important
circumstances
that
seem
to
speak
against
the
maternal
instinct
these
consist
primarily
in
the
fact
that
the
sexual
impulse
endures
to
a
time
when
the
mother
is
no
longer
young
enough
to
bear
a
child
we
know
that
the
first
gray
hair
in
no
sense
indicates
the
last
lover
and
according
to
tait
a
period
of
powerful
ensues
directly
after
the
climacterium
now
of
what
use
so
far
as
is
concerned
can
such
an
impulse
be
but
because
natural
instincts
endure
beyond
their
period
of
purposive
efficiency
it
does
not
follow
that
they
are
unconnected
with
that
efficiency
we
eat
and
drink
also
when
the
food
is
superfluous
as
nourishment
wonderfully
as
nature
has
adjusted
the
instincts
and
functions
to
definite
purposes
she
still
has
at
no
point
drawn
fixed
boundaries
and
actually
destroyed
her
instrument
where
the
need
for
it
ceased
just
because
nature
is
elsewhere
parsimonious
she
seems
frequently
extravagant
yet
that
extravagance
is
the
cheapest
means
of
attaining
the
necessary
end
thus
when
passion
is
no
longer
required
for
the
function
of
motherhood
its
impulsion
may
yet
be
counted
on
for
the
psychological
explanation
of
more
than
one
criminal
event
what
is
important
is
to
count
the
maternal
instinct
as
a
factor
in
criminal
situations
if
we
have
done
so
we
find
explanations
not
only
of
sexual
impropriety
but
of
the
more
subtle
questions
of
the
more
or
less
pure
relation
between
husband
and
wife
what
attitude
the
woman
takes
toward
her
husband
and
children
what
she
demands
of
them
what
she
sacrifices
for
them
what
makes
it
possible
for
her
to
endure
an
apparently
unendurable
situation
what
again
undermines
directly
and
suddenly
in
spite
of
seemingly
small
value
her
courage
in
life
these
are
all
conditions
which
appear
in
countless
processes
as
the
distinguishing
and
explaining
elements
and
they
are
to
be
understood
in
the
single
term
for
a
long
time
the
inexplicability
of
love
and
sexual
impulse
were
offered
as
excuses
but
these
otherwise
mighty
factors
had
to
be
assigned
such
remarkable
and
aspects
that
only
one
confusion
was
added
to
another
and
called
explanation
now
suppose
we
try
to
explain
them
by
means
of
the
maternal
instinct
section
e
submerged
sexual
factors
the
criminal
psychologist
finds
difficulties
where
hidden
impulses
are
at
work
without
seeming
to
have
any
relation
to
their
results
in
such
cases
the
for
explanation
is
sought
in
the
wrong
direction
i
say
because
must
be
conscious
and
might
be
misunderstood
we
know
of
countless
criminal
cases
which
we
face
powerless
because
we
do
indeed
know
the
criminal
but
are
unable
to
explain
the
causal
connection
between
him
and
the
crime
or
because
again
we
do
not
know
the
criminal
and
judge
from
the
facts
that
we
might
have
gotten
a
clew
if
we
had
understood
the
psychological
development
of
the
crime
if
we
seek
for
we
may
possibly
think
of
so
many
of
them
as
never
to
approach
the
right
one
if
we
seek
motives
we
may
be
far
misled
because
we
are
able
only
to
bring
the
criminal
into
connection
with
his
success
a
matter
which
he
must
have
had
in
mind
from
the
beginning
it
is
ever
easy
for
us
when
motive
and
crime
are
in
open
connection
greed
theft
revenge
arson
jealousy
murder
etc
in
these
cases
the
whole
business
of
examination
is
an
example
in
arithmetic
possibly
difficult
but
fundamental
when
however
from
the
deed
to
its
last
traceable
grounds
even
to
the
attitude
of
the
criminal
a
connected
series
may
be
discovered
and
yet
no
explanation
is
forthcoming
then
the
business
of
interpretation
has
reached
its
end
we
begin
to
feel
about
in
the
dark
if
we
find
nothing
the
situation
is
comparatively
good
but
it
is
exceedingly
bad
in
the
numerous
cases
in
which
we
believe
ourselves
to
have
sighted
and
pursued
the
proper
solution
such
a
hidden
source
or
of
very
numerous
crimes
is
sex
that
it
often
works
invisibly
is
due
to
the
sense
of
shame
therefore
it
is
more
frequent
in
women
the
hidden
sexual
plays
its
part
in
the
little
insignificant
lie
of
an
unimportant
woman
witness
as
well
as
in
the
poisoning
of
a
husband
for
the
sake
of
a
paramour
still
to
be
won
it
sails
everywhere
under
a
false
flag
nobody
permits
the
passion
to
show
in
itself
it
must
receive
another
name
even
in
the
mind
of
the
woman
whom
it
dominates
the
first
of
the
forms
which
the
sexual
impulse
takes
is
false
piety
religiosity
this
is
something
ancient
friedreich
points
to
the
connection
between
religious
activity
and
the
sexual
organization
and
cites
many
stories
about
saints
like
that
of
the
nun
blanbekin
of
whom
it
was
said
scire
desiderasse
cum
lacrimis
et
moerore
maximo
ubinam
esset
praeputium
the
holy
veronica
juliani
in
memory
of
the
lamb
of
god
took
a
lamb
to
bed
with
her
and
nursed
it
at
her
breast
similarly
suggestive
things
are
told
of
catherine
of
genoa
of
armela
of
elizabeth
of
the
child
jesus
etc
reinhard
says
correctly
that
sweet
memories
are
frequently
nothing
more
or
less
than
outbursts
of
hidden
passion
and
attacks
of
sensual
love
seume
is
mistaken
in
his
assertion
that
mysticism
lies
mainly
in
weakness
of
the
nerves
and
colic
it
lies
a
span
deeper
the
use
of
this
fact
is
simple
we
must
discover
whether
a
woman
is
morally
pure
or
sensual
etc
this
is
important
not
only
in
violations
of
morality
but
in
every
violation
of
law
the
answers
we
receive
to
questions
on
this
matter
are
almost
without
exception
worthless
or
untrue
because
the
object
of
the
question
is
not
open
to
view
is
difficult
to
observe
and
is
kept
hidden
from
even
the
nearest
our
purpose
is
therefore
best
attained
by
directing
the
question
to
religious
activity
religiosity
and
similar
traits
these
are
not
only
easy
to
perceive
but
are
openly
exhibited
because
of
their
nature
whoever
assumes
piety
does
so
for
the
sake
of
other
people
therefore
does
not
hide
it
if
religious
extravagance
can
be
reliably
confirmed
by
witnesses
it
will
rarely
be
a
mistake
to
assume
inclination
to
more
or
less
stifled
sexual
pleasure
examples
of
the
relationship
are
known
to
every
one
of
us
but
i
want
to
cite
two
out
of
my
own
experience
as
types
in
one
of
them
the
question
turned
on
the
fact
that
a
somewhat
old
unmarried
woman
had
appropriated
certain
rather
large
trust
sums
and
had
presented
them
to
her
servant
at
first
every
suspicion
of
the
influence
of
sex
was
set
aside
only
the
discovery
of
the
fact
that
in
her
ostentatious
piety
she
had
set
up
an
altar
in
her
house
and
compelled
her
servant
to
pray
at
it
in
her
company
called
attention
to
the
deep
interest
of
this
very
moral
maiden
in
her
servant
the
second
case
dealt
with
the
poisoning
of
an
old
impotent
husband
by
his
young
wife
the
latter
was
not
suspected
by
anybody
but
at
her
examination
drew
suspicion
to
herself
by
her
unctuous
pious
appearance
she
was
permitted
to
express
herself
at
length
on
religious
themes
and
showed
so
very
great
a
love
of
saints
and
religious
secrets
that
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
that
a
glowing
sensuality
must
be
concealed
underneath
this
religious
ash
adultery
could
not
be
proved
she
must
have
for
one
reason
or
another
avoided
it
and
that
her
impotent
husband
was
unsatisfactory
was
now
indubitable
the
supposition
that
she
wanted
to
get
rid
of
him
in
order
to
marry
somebody
else
was
now
inevitable
and
as
this
somebody
else
was
looked
for
and
discovered
the
adduction
of
evidence
of
her
guilt
was
no
longer
difficult
how
captious
it
is
to
prove
direct
passion
and
to
attach
reasonable
suspicion
thereto
and
how
necessary
it
is
first
of
all
to
establish
what
the
concealing
material
is
is
shown
in
a
remark
of
kraus
who
asserts
that
the
wife
never
affects
to
be
passionate
with
her
husband
her
desire
is
to
seduce
him
and
she
could
not
desire
that
if
she
were
not
passionate
this
assertion
is
only
correct
in
general
it
is
not
however
true
that
woman
has
no
reason
for
affectation
for
there
are
enough
cases
in
which
some
woman
rendered
with
child
by
a
poor
man
desires
to
seduce
a
man
of
wealth
in
order
to
get
a
wealthy
father
for
her
child
in
such
and
similar
cases
the
woman
could
make
use
of
every
trick
of
seduction
without
needing
to
be
in
the
least
passionately
disposed
another
important
form
of
submerged
sexuality
is
ennui
nobody
can
say
what
ennui
is
and
everybody
knows
it
most
accurately
nobody
would
say
that
it
is
burdensome
and
yet
everybody
knows
again
that
a
large
group
of
evil
deeds
spring
from
ennui
it
is
not
the
same
as
idleness
i
may
be
idle
without
being
bored
and
i
may
be
bored
although
i
am
busy
at
best
boredom
may
be
called
an
attitude
which
the
mind
is
thrown
into
because
of
an
unsatisfied
desire
for
different
things
we
speak
of
a
tedious
region
a
tedious
lecture
and
tedious
company
only
by
way
of
metonymy
we
always
mean
the
emotional
state
they
put
us
into
the
internal
condition
is
determinative
for
things
that
are
boresome
to
one
may
be
very
interesting
to
another
a
collection
a
library
a
lecture
are
all
tedious
and
boresome
by
transposition
of
the
emotional
state
to
the
objective
content
and
in
this
way
the
idea
of
boredom
gets
a
wide
scope
we
however
shall
speak
of
boredom
as
an
emotional
state
we
find
it
most
frequently
among
girls
young
women
and
among
undeveloped
or
feminine
men
as
a
very
significant
phenomenon
so
found
it
is
that
particular
dreamful
happy
or
unhappy
attitude
expressed
in
desire
for
something
absent
in
quiet
reproaches
concerning
the
lack
of
the
satisfaction
of
that
desire
with
the
continually
recurring
wish
for
filling
out
an
inner
void
the
basis
of
all
this
is
mainly
sex
it
can
not
be
proved
as
such
mathematically
but
experience
shows
that
the
emotional
attitude
occurs
only
in
the
presence
of
sexual
energy
that
it
is
lacking
when
the
desires
are
satisfied
but
that
otherwise
even
the
richest
and
best
substitution
can
offer
no
satisfaction
it
is
not
daring
therefore
to
infer
the
erotic
again
we
see
how
the
moralizing
and
training
influence
of
work
suppresses
all
superfluous
states
which
themselves
make
express
demands
and
might
want
complete
satisfaction
but
everything
has
its
limits
and
frequently
the
gentle
still
power
of
sweet
ennui
is
stronger
than
the
pressure
and
compulsion
of
work
when
this
power
is
present
it
never
results
in
good
rarely
in
anything
indifferent
and
frequently
forbidden
fruit
ripens
slowly
in
its
shadow
nobody
will
assert
that
ennui
is
the
cause
of
illicit
relations
of
seduction
of
adultery
and
all
the
many
sins
that
depend
on
it
from
petty
misappropriations
for
the
sake
of
the
beloved
to
the
murder
of
the
unloved
husband
but
ennui
is
for
the
criminal
psychologist
a
sign
that
the
woman
was
unsatisfied
with
what
she
had
and
wanted
something
else
from
wishing
to
willing
from
willing
to
asking
is
not
such
a
great
distance
but
if
we
ask
the
repentant
sinner
when
she
began
to
think
of
her
criminal
action
we
always
learn
that
she
suffered
from
incurable
ennui
in
which
wicked
thoughts
came
and
still
more
wicked
plans
were
hatched
any
experienced
criminal
psychologist
will
tell
you
when
you
ask
him
whether
he
has
been
much
subject
to
mistakes
in
trying
to
explain
crimes
from
the
of
their
ennui
the
neighborhood
knows
of
the
periods
of
this
ennui
and
the
sinner
thinks
that
they
are
almost
discovered
if
she
is
asked
about
them
cherchez
la
femme
cherchez
cherchez
and
hundreds
of
times
you
find
the
solution
conceit
too
may
be
caused
by
hidden
sexuality
we
need
only
to
use
the
word
denotatively
for
when
we
speak
of
the
conceit
of
a
scholar
an
official
or
a
soldier
we
mean
properly
the
desire
for
fame
the
activity
of
getting
oneself
praised
and
recognized
conceit
proper
is
only
womanish
or
a
property
of
feminine
men
and
just
as
according
to
darwin
the
coloration
of
birds
insects
and
even
plants
serves
only
the
purposes
of
sexual
selection
and
has
therefore
sexual
grounds
so
also
the
conceit
of
woman
has
only
sexual
purpose
she
is
conceited
for
men
alone
even
though
through
the
medium
of
other
women
as
lotze
wrote
in
his
that
calls
attention
to
her
person
without
doing
her
any
harm
is
instinctively
used
by
woman
as
a
means
in
sexual
there
is
much
truth
in
the
terms
and
the
man
takes
the
battle
up
directly
and
if
we
deal
with
this
subject
without
frills
we
may
not
deny
that
animals
behave
just
as
men
do
the
males
battle
directly
with
each
other
for
the
sake
of
the
females
who
are
compelled
to
study
how
to
arouse
this
struggle
for
their
person
and
thus
hit
upon
the
use
of
conceit
in
sexual
conflict
that
women
are
conceited
does
not
much
matter
to
us
criminal
psychologists
we
know
it
and
do
not
need
to
be
told
but
the
forms
in
which
their
conceit
expresses
itself
are
important
its
consequences
and
its
relation
to
other
conditions
are
important
to
make
use
of
feminine
conceit
in
the
is
not
an
art
but
an
unpermissible
trick
which
might
lead
too
far
whoever
wants
to
succeed
with
women
as
madame
de
rieux
says
bring
their
into
and
prosp√®re
are
to
be
sought
not
through
their
senses
their
weakness
is
in
their
heart
and
these
properties
are
however
so
powerful
that
they
may
easily
lead
to
deception
if
the
judge
does
not
understand
how
to
follow
this
prescription
it
does
no
good
but
if
he
does
understand
it
he
has
a
weapon
with
which
woman
may
be
driven
too
far
and
then
wounded
pride
anger
and
even
suggestion
work
in
far
too
vigorous
a
manner
for
example
a
woman
wants
to
defend
her
lover
before
the
judge
now
if
the
latter
succeeds
by
the
demonstration
of
natural
true
facts
in
wounding
her
conceit
in
convincing
her
that
she
is
betrayed
harmed
or
forgotten
by
her
protected
lover
or
if
she
is
merely
made
to
believe
this
she
goes
in
most
cases
farther
than
she
can
excuse
and
accuses
and
harms
him
as
much
as
possible
tries
if
she
is
able
to
destroy
him
whether
rightly
or
wrongly
she
does
not
care
she
has
lost
her
lover
and
nobody
else
shall
have
him
conceit
says
lombroso
itself
especially
in
the
fact
that
the
most
important
thing
in
the
life
of
woman
is
the
struggle
for
this
assertion
is
strengthened
by
a
long
series
of
examples
and
historical
considerations
and
can
serve
as
a
guiding
thread
in
many
labyrinthine
cases
first
of
all
it
is
important
to
know
in
many
trials
whether
a
woman
has
already
taken
up
this
struggle
for
men
whether
she
has
a
lover
or
wishes
to
have
a
lover
if
it
can
be
shown
that
she
has
suddenly
become
conceited
or
her
conceit
has
been
really
intensified
the
question
has
an
unconditionally
affirmative
answer
frequently
enough
one
may
succeed
even
in
determining
the
particular
man
by
ascertaining
with
certainty
the
time
at
which
this
conceit
first
began
and
whether
it
had
closer
or
more
distant
reference
to
some
man
if
these
conditions
once
discovered
are
otherwise
at
all
confirmed
and
there
are
no
mistakes
in
observation
the
inference
is
inevitably
certain
we
learn
much
concerning
feminine
conceit
when
we
ask
how
a
man
could
have
altered
the
inclination
of
a
woman
whose
equal
he
in
no
sense
was
it
is
not
necessary
in
such
cases
to
fuss
about
the
insoluble
riddle
of
the
female
heart
and
about
the
secrets
of
the
feminine
soul
vulpes
vult
fraudem
lupus
agnum
femina
laudem
this
illuminates
every
profundity
the
man
in
question
knew
how
to
make
use
of
laudem
he
knew
how
to
excite
feminine
conceit
and
so
vanquished
others
who
were
worth
much
more
than
he
this
goes
so
far
that
by
knowing
the
degree
of
feminine
conceit
we
know
also
the
vivacity
of
feminine
sexuality
and
the
latter
is
criminologically
important
heinroth
says
feminine
individual
so
long
as
it
has
demands
to
make
or
believes
itself
to
have
them
has
utmost
conceit
is
the
sexual
and
we
may
add
the
standard
of
as
soon
as
the
child
has
the
first
ribbon
woven
into
its
hair
sexuality
has
been
excited
it
increases
with
the
love
of
tinsel
and
glitter
and
dies
when
the
aging
female
begins
to
neglect
herself
and
to
go
about
unwashed
woman
lies
when
she
asserts
that
everything
is
dead
in
her
heart
and
sits
before
you
neatly
and
decoratively
dressed
she
lies
when
she
says
that
she
still
loves
her
husband
and
at
the
same
time
shows
considerable
carelessness
about
her
body
and
clothes
she
lies
when
she
assures
you
that
she
has
always
been
the
same
and
her
conceit
has
come
or
gone
these
statements
constitute
unexceptionable
rules
the
use
of
them
involves
no
possible
error
we
have
now
the
opportunity
to
understand
what
feminine
knowledge
is
worth
and
in
what
degree
it
is
reliable
this
is
no
place
to
discuss
the
capacity
of
the
feminine
brain
and
to
venture
into
the
dangerous
field
which
schopenhauer
and
his
disciples
and
modern
anthropologists
have
entered
merely
to
quarrel
in
the
business
is
the
concrete
case
in
which
he
must
test
the
expressions
of
a
woman
when
they
depend
upon
real
or
apparent
knowledge
either
just
as
he
must
test
the
testimony
of
any
other
witness
or
by
means
of
experts
we
shall
therefore
indicate
only
the
symptomatic
value
of
feminine
knowledge
with
regard
to
feminine
conceit
according
to
lotze
women
go
to
theater
and
to
church
only
to
show
their
clothes
and
to
appear
artistic
and
pious
while
says
that
women
learn
only
that
it
may
be
said
of
them
are
scholars
but
for
knowledge
they
care
not
at
all
this
is
important
because
we
are
likely
with
regard
to
knowledge
in
the
deepest
sense
of
the
word
to
be
frequently
unjust
to
women
we
are
accustomed
to
suppose
that
the
accumulation
of
some
form
of
knowledge
must
have
some
definite
hence
causally
related
connection
with
purpose
we
ask
why
the
scholar
is
interested
in
his
subject
why
he
has
sought
this
knowledge
and
in
most
cases
we
find
the
right
reason
when
we
have
found
the
logical
connection
and
have
sought
it
logically
this
might
have
explained
difficult
cases
but
not
where
the
knowledge
of
women
is
concerned
women
are
interested
in
art
literature
and
science
mainly
out
of
conceit
but
they
care
also
for
hundreds
of
other
little
things
in
order
by
the
knowledge
of
them
to
show
off
as
scholars
conceit
and
curiosity
are
closely
related
women
therefore
often
attain
information
that
might
cause
them
to
be
listed
as
suspects
if
it
could
not
be
harmlessly
explained
by
conceit
conceit
however
has
itself
to
be
explained
by
the
struggle
for
men
because
woman
knows
instinctively
that
she
can
use
knowledge
in
this
struggle
and
this
struggle
for
the
other
sex
frequently
betrays
own
crime
or
the
crime
of
others
somebody
said
that
first
thought
after
eating
the
apple
was
does
my
fit
it
is
a
tasteful
notion
that
eve
who
needed
only
to
please
her
adam
thought
only
of
this
after
all
the
sorrow
of
the
first
sin
but
it
is
true
and
we
may
imagine
state
of
mind
to
be
as
follows
i
now
please
him
more
or
less
it
is
characteristic
that
the
question
about
dress
is
said
to
have
been
the
question
it
shows
the
power
of
conceit
the
swiftness
with
which
it
presses
to
the
front
indeed
of
all
crimes
against
property
half
would
have
remained
undiscovered
if
the
criminals
had
been
enough
to
keep
their
unjustly
acquired
gains
dark
for
a
while
that
they
have
not
constitutes
the
hope
of
every
judge
for
the
discovery
of
the
criminal
and
the
hope
is
greater
with
the
extent
of
the
theft
it
may
be
assumed
that
the
criminal
exhibits
the
fruits
of
his
crime
but
that
it
is
difficult
to
discover
when
there
is
not
much
of
it
this
general
rule
is
much
more
efficacious
among
women
than
among
men
for
which
reason
a
criminalist
who
suspects
some
person
thinks
rather
of
arresting
this
wife
or
mistress
than
himself
when
the
apprentice
steals
something
from
his
master
his
girl
gets
a
new
shawl
and
that
is
not
kept
in
the
chest
but
immediately
decorates
the
shoulders
of
the
girl
indeed
women
of
the
profoundest
culture
can
not
wait
a
moment
to
decorate
themselves
with
their
new
gauds
and
we
hear
that
gypsies
who
have
been
caught
in
some
fresh
crime
are
betrayed
mainly
by
the
fact
that
the
women
who
had
watched
the
house
to
be
robbed
had
been
trying
on
bits
of
clothing
while
the
men
were
still
inside
cleaning
the
place
up
what
was
most
important
for
the
women
was
to
meet
the
men
already
decorated
anew
when
the
men
would
finally
come
back
the
old
maid
is
from
the
sexual
standpoint
legally
important
because
she
is
in
herself
rather
different
from
other
women
and
hence
must
be
differently
understood
the
properties
assigned
to
these
very
pitiful
creatures
are
many
of
the
almost
exclusively
unpleasant
peculiarities
assigned
to
them
they
may
be
said
really
to
possess
the
old
maid
has
failed
in
her
natural
function
and
thus
exhibits
all
that
is
implied
in
this
accident
bitterness
envy
unpleasantness
hard
judgment
of
qualities
and
deeds
difficulty
in
forming
new
relationships
exaggerated
fear
and
prudery
the
latter
mainly
as
simulation
of
innocence
it
is
a
fact
that
every
experienced
judge
may
confirm
that
old
maids
we
mean
here
always
childless
unmarried
women
of
considerable
age
not
maids
in
the
anatomical
sense
as
witnesses
always
bring
something
new
if
you
have
heard
ten
statements
and
the
eleventh
is
made
by
an
old
maid
it
will
be
different
the
latter
according
to
her
nature
has
observed
differently
introduces
a
collection
of
doubts
and
suggestions
introduces
nasty
implications
into
harmless
things
and
if
possible
connects
her
own
self
with
the
matter
this
is
as
significant
as
explicable
the
poor
creature
has
not
gotten
much
good
out
of
life
has
never
had
a
male
protector
was
frequently
enough
defenseless
against
scorn
and
teasing
the
amenities
of
social
life
and
friendship
were
rarely
her
portion
it
is
therefore
almost
inevitable
that
she
should
see
evil
everywhere
if
she
has
observed
some
quarrel
from
her
window
she
will
testify
that
the
thing
was
provoked
in
order
to
disturb
her
if
a
coachman
has
run
over
a
child
she
suggests
that
he
had
been
driving
at
her
in
order
to
frighten
her
the
thief
who
broke
into
her
house
really
wanted
to
break
into
hers
because
she
is
without
protection
and
therefore
open
to
all
attacks
so
that
it
is
conceivable
that
he
should
want
to
hurt
her
as
a
rule
there
will
be
other
witnesses
or
the
old
maid
will
be
so
energetic
in
her
testimonies
that
her
will
not
do
much
damage
but
it
is
always
wise
to
be
cautious
of
course
there
are
exceptions
and
it
is
that
exceptions
occur
by
way
of
extreme
contrast
if
an
old
maid
does
not
possess
the
unpleasant
characteristics
of
her
breed
she
is
extraordinarily
kind
and
lovable
in
such
a
way
generally
that
her
all
too
mild
and
rather
blind
conceptions
of
an
event
make
her
a
dangerous
witness
it
is
also
true
that
old
maids
frequently
are
better
educated
and
more
civilized
than
other
women
as
de
quincey
shows
they
are
so
because
without
the
care
of
husband
and
children
they
have
time
for
all
kinds
of
excellences
especially
when
they
are
inclined
thereto
it
is
notable
that
the
founders
of
charitable
societies
are
generally
old
maids
or
childless
widows
who
have
not
had
the
joys
and
tasks
of
motherhood
we
must
take
care
therefore
in
judging
the
kindness
of
a
woman
against
being
blinded
by
her
philanthropic
activity
that
may
be
kindness
but
as
a
rule
it
may
have
its
source
in
the
lack
of
occupation
and
in
striving
for
some
form
of
motherhood
in
judging
old
maids
we
deceive
ourselves
still
more
easily
because
as
darwin
keenly
noted
they
always
have
some
masculine
quality
in
their
external
appearance
as
well
as
in
their
activity
and
feeling
now
that
kind
of
woman
is
generally
strange
to
us
we
start
wrong
when
we
judge
her
by
customary
standards
and
miss
the
point
when
in
the
cases
of
such
old
maids
we
presuppose
only
feminine
qualities
and
overlook
the
very
virile
additions
we
may
add
to
these
qualities
the
intrinsic
productivity
of
old
maids
benneke
in
his
psychologie
compares
the
activity
of
a
very
busy
housewife
with
that
of
an
unmarried
virgin
and
thinks
the
worth
of
the
former
to
be
higher
while
the
latter
accomplishes
more
by
way
of
fancies
intrigues
inheritances
winnings
in
the
lottery
and
hypochondriac
this
is
very
instructive
from
the
criminological
point
of
view
for
the
criminalist
can
not
be
too
cautious
when
he
has
an
old
maid
to
examine
therefore
when
a
case
occurs
containing
characteristic
intrigues
fanciful
inheritances
and
winnings
in
the
lottery
it
will
be
well
to
seek
out
the
old
maid
behind
these
things
she
may
considerably
help
the
explanation
both
professional
and
popular
judgment
agree
that
the
largest
majority
of
women
have
great
fear
of
becoming
old
maids
we
are
told
how
this
fear
expresses
itself
in
foreign
countries
in
spain
it
is
said
that
a
spanish
woman
who
has
passed
her
first
bloom
takes
the
first
available
candidate
for
her
hand
in
order
to
avoid
and
in
russia
every
mature
girl
who
is
able
to
do
so
goes
abroad
for
a
couple
of
years
in
order
to
return
as
everybody
knows
the
event
nobody
asks
for
particulars
about
it
some
such
process
is
universal
and
many
an
unfortunate
marriage
and
allied
crime
may
be
explained
by
it
girls
who
at
seventeen
or
eighteen
were
very
particular
and
had
a
right
to
be
are
modest
at
twenty
and
at
marry
at
any
price
in
order
not
to
remain
old
maids
that
this
is
not
and
is
often
contrary
to
intelligence
is
clear
and
when
neither
heart
nor
head
rule
the
devil
laughs
and
it
is
out
of
such
marriages
that
adultery
the
flight
of
the
wife
cruelty
robbery
from
the
spouse
and
worse
things
arise
therefore
it
will
be
worth
while
to
study
the
history
of
the
marriage
in
question
was
it
a
marriage
in
the
name
of
god
the
marriage
of
an
old
maid
then
double
caution
must
be
used
in
the
study
of
the
case
there
is
some
advantage
in
knowing
the
popular
conception
of
when
a
girl
becomes
an
old
maid
for
is
a
matter
of
a
point
of
view
it
depends
on
the
opinion
of
other
people
deals
considerably
with
this
question
for
it
can
itself
determine
the
popular
attitude
to
the
unmarried
state
so
brandes
discovers
that
the
heroines
of
classical
novelists
of
racine
shakespeare
moliere
voltaire
ariosto
byron
lesage
scott
are
almost
always
sixteen
years
of
age
in
modern
times
women
in
novels
have
their
great
in
the
thirties
how
this
advance
in
years
took
place
we
need
not
bother
to
find
out
but
that
it
has
occurred
we
must
keep
in
mind
before
concluding
the
chapter
on
sexual
conditions
we
must
say
a
word
about
hysteria
which
so
very
frequently
has
deceived
the
judge
hysteria
was
named
by
the
ancients
as
is
known
from
·º°
·ΩëœÉœÑ·ºëœÅŒ±
the
womb
and
properly
for
most
of
the
causes
of
evil
are
there
hidden
the
hysterics
are
legally
significant
in
various
ways
their
fixed
ideas
often
cause
elaborate
unreasonable
explanations
they
want
to
attract
attention
they
are
always
concerned
with
themselves
are
always
wildly
enthusiastic
about
somebody
else
often
they
persecute
others
with
unwarranted
hatred
and
they
are
the
source
of
the
coarsest
denunciations
particularly
with
regard
to
sexual
crimes
incidentally
most
of
them
are
smart
and
have
a
diseased
acuity
of
the
senses
hearing
and
smell
in
particular
are
sometimes
remarkably
alert
although
not
always
reliable
for
hysterics
frequently
discover
more
than
is
there
on
the
other
hand
they
often
are
useful
because
of
their
delicate
senses
and
it
is
never
necessary
to
show
the
correctness
of
their
perception
out
of
hand
bianchi
rightly
calls
attention
to
the
fact
that
hysterics
like
to
write
anonymous
letters
writers
of
these
are
generally
women
and
mainly
hysterical
women
if
a
man
writes
them
he
is
indubitably
feminine
in
nature
most
difficulties
with
hysterics
occur
when
they
suffer
some
damage
for
they
not
only
add
a
number
of
dishonest
phenomena
but
also
actually
feel
them
i
might
recall
by
way
of
example
story
that
hysterics
regularly
get
cramps
laughing
when
their
feet
get
cold
if
this
is
true
it
is
easy
to
conceive
what
else
may
happen
all
this
clearly
is
a
matter
for
the
court
physician
who
alone
should
be
the
proper
authority
when
a
hysteric
is
before
the
court
we
lawyers
have
only
to
know
what
significant
dangers
hysterics
threaten
and
further
that
the
physician
is
to
be
called
whenever
one
of
them
is
before
us
unfortunately
there
are
no
specific
symptoms
of
hysteria
which
the
layman
can
make
use
of
we
must
be
satisfied
with
the
little
that
has
just
been
mentioned
hysteria
i
had
almost
said
is
nowadays
so
widespread
that
everybody
has
some
approximate
knowledge
of
how
it
affects
its
victims
feminine
section
a
intelligence
feminine
intelligence
properly
deserves
a
separate
section
intelligence
is
a
function
that
has
in
both
sexes
some
basis
and
purpose
and
proceeds
according
to
the
same
rules
but
the
meaning
of
intelligence
must
be
abandoned
if
we
are
to
suppose
it
so
rigid
and
so
difficult
to
hold
that
the
differences
between
man
and
woman
could
have
had
no
influence
on
it
the
fundamentally
distinct
bodies
the
very
different
occupations
of
both
sexes
their
different
destinies
must
have
had
profound
mutative
influence
on
their
intelligence
moreover
we
must
always
start
with
a
difference
of
attitude
in
the
two
sexes
in
which
the
purely
positive
belongs
to
one
only
and
we
must
see
whether
it
is
not
intensified
by
the
negative
of
the
other
when
one
body
presses
on
another
the
resulting
impression
is
due
not
only
to
the
hardness
of
the
first
but
also
to
the
softness
of
the
second
and
when
we
hear
about
the
extraordinary
wit
of
a
woman
we
must
blame
the
considerable
idiocy
of
the
men
she
associates
with
how
many
women
are
to
be
trusted
for
intelligence
is
a
question
of
great
importance
for
the
criminalist
inasmuch
as
right
judgment
depends
on
the
attitude
and
good
sense
of
the
witnesses
and
must
determine
the
value
of
the
material
presented
us
we
wish
to
make
no
detailed
in
what
follows
we
shall
merely
consider
in
their
general
aspects
those
functions
which
we
are
accustomed
to
find
in
our
own
work
section
conception
concerning
feminine
we
have
already
spoken
there
is
no
significant
difference
between
the
two
sexes
although
in
conceptual
power
we
find
differences
very
distinct
it
may
be
generally
said
as
the
daily
life
shows
that
women
conceive
differently
from
men
whatever
a
dozen
men
may
agree
on
conceptually
will
be
differently
thought
of
by
any
one
woman
now
what
is
significant
in
this
fact
is
that
generally
the
woman
is
correct
that
she
has
a
better
conception
and
still
under
the
same
circumstances
we
continue
to
conceive
in
the
same
way
even
for
the
tenth
time
this
fact
demonstrates
that
a
different
form
of
organization
an
essential
difference
in
nature
determines
the
character
of
conception
in
the
two
sexes
if
we
compare
values
the
result
will
be
different
according
to
sex
even
with
regard
to
the
very
material
compared
or
to
the
manner
in
which
it
has
been
discovered
in
the
apprehension
of
situations
the
perception
of
attitudes
the
judgment
of
people
in
certain
relations
in
all
that
is
called
tact
in
all
that
involves
some
abstraction
or
clarification
of
confused
and
twisted
material
and
finally
in
all
that
involves
human
volitions
women
are
superior
and
more
reliable
individually
then
ten
men
together
but
the
manner
in
which
the
woman
obtains
her
conception
is
less
valuable
being
the
manner
of
pure
instinct
or
suppose
that
we
call
it
more
delicate
feeling
the
name
does
not
matter
the
process
is
mainly
unconscious
and
is
hence
of
less
value
only
if
i
may
say
so
as
requiring
less
thought
in
consequence
there
is
not
only
not
a
decrease
in
the
utility
of
feminine
testimony
also
its
reliability
is
very
great
there
may
be
hundreds
of
errors
in
the
dialectical
procedure
of
a
man
while
there
is
much
more
certainty
in
the
instinctive
conception
and
the
direct
reproduction
of
a
woman
hence
her
statements
are
more
reliable
we
need
not
call
the
source
of
this
instinct
restitution
for
feminine
deficiency
in
other
matters
we
can
show
that
it
is
due
to
natural
selection
and
that
the
position
and
task
of
woman
requires
her
to
observe
her
environment
very
closely
this
need
sharpened
the
inner
sense
until
it
became
unconscious
conception
feminine
interest
in
the
environment
is
what
gives
female
intuition
a
swiftness
and
certainty
unattainable
in
the
meditations
of
the
profoundest
philosophers
the
swiftness
of
the
intuition
which
excludes
all
reflection
and
which
merely
solves
problems
is
the
important
thing
woman
perceives
clearly
as
spencer
says
somewhere
the
mental
status
of
her
personal
environment
while
schopenhauer
has
incorrectly
suggested
that
women
differ
from
men
intellectually
because
they
are
lazy
and
want
to
attain
their
purpose
in
point
of
fact
they
do
not
want
they
simply
avoid
complicated
inference
and
depend
upon
intuition
as
they
very
safely
may
vision
is
possible
only
where
perception
is
possible
when
things
are
near
the
distant
and
the
veiled
can
not
be
seen
but
must
be
inferred
hence
women
let
inference
alone
and
do
what
they
can
do
better
this
suggests
the
value
of
these
different
interpretations
of
the
feminine
mode
of
conception
as
lawyers
we
may
believe
women
where
intuition
is
involved
where
inference
is
a
factor
we
must
be
very
careful
sensory
conception
is
to
be
understood
in
the
same
way
as
intellectual
conception
according
to
mantegazza
woman
has
a
particularly
good
eye
for
the
delicate
aspects
of
things
but
has
no
capacity
for
seeing
things
on
the
horizon
a
remote
big
object
does
not
much
excite
her
interest
this
is
explained
by
the
supposed
fact
that
women
as
a
rule
can
not
see
so
far
as
men
and
are
unable
to
distinguish
the
distant
object
so
well
this
is
no
explanation
because
it
would
be
as
valid
of
all
people
the
truth
is
that
the
definition
of
distant
objects
requires
more
or
less
reason
and
inference
woman
does
not
reason
and
infer
and
if
things
miss
her
intuition
they
do
not
exist
for
her
objectivity
is
another
property
that
women
lack
they
tend
always
to
think
in
personalities
and
they
conceive
objects
in
terms
of
personal
sympathies
tell
a
woman
about
a
case
so
that
her
interest
will
be
excited
without
your
naming
the
individuals
save
as
a
and
b
and
it
will
be
impossible
to
get
her
to
take
a
stand
or
to
make
a
judgment
who
are
the
people
what
are
they
how
old
are
they
these
questions
must
be
answered
first
hence
the
divergent
feminine
conceptions
of
a
case
before
and
after
the
names
are
discovered
the
personalizing
tendency
results
in
some
extraordinary
things
suppose
a
woman
is
describing
a
brawl
between
two
persons
or
two
groups
if
the
sides
were
equally
matched
in
strength
and
weapons
and
if
the
witness
in
question
did
not
know
any
of
the
fighters
before
she
will
nevertheless
redistribute
sun
and
wind
in
her
description
if
one
of
the
brawlers
happens
accidentally
to
have
interested
her
or
has
behaved
in
a
fashion
though
under
other
circumstances
he
might
have
earned
only
her
dislike
in
such
cases
the
fairy
tale
about
telling
mere
facts
recurs
and
i
have
to
repeat
that
nobody
tells
mere
facts
that
judgment
and
inference
always
enter
into
statements
and
that
women
use
them
more
than
men
of
course
real
facts
and
inferred
ones
can
be
distinguished
infrequently
however
and
never
with
certainty
it
is
best
therefore
to
determine
whether
the
witness
bears
any
relation
to
one
of
the
parties
and
what
it
is
and
this
relation
will
be
an
element
in
most
cases
inasmuch
as
one
rarely
is
present
at
a
quarrel
without
some
share
in
it
but
even
if
the
latter
case
should
occur
it
is
necessary
first
of
all
to
hear
every
detail
so
as
to
get
the
attitude
clearly
in
mind
the
evidence
of
the
mode
of
conception
is
of
more
importance
than
the
evidence
concerning
the
fact
itself
and
finding
the
former
is
easy
enough
if
the
woman
is
for
a
short
time
allowed
to
speak
generally
when
her
attitude
is
known
the
standard
for
adjusting
her
excuses
of
one
and
accusations
of
another
is
easily
discovered
the
same
is
true
in
purely
individual
cases
in
the
eyes
of
woman
the
same
crime
committed
by
one
man
is
black
as
hell
committed
by
another
it
is
in
all
respects
excusable
all
that
is
necessary
for
this
attitude
is
the
play
of
sympathies
and
antipathies
generated
from
whatever
source
just
as
the
woman
reader
of
romances
favors
one
hero
and
hates
another
so
the
woman
witness
behaves
toward
her
figures
and
it
may
happen
that
she
finds
one
of
them
to
have
murdered
with
such
excellence
and
the
victim
to
have
been
a
boresome
philistine
that
she
excuses
the
crime
caution
is
here
the
most
necessary
thing
of
course
women
are
not
alone
in
taking
such
attitudes
but
they
are
never
so
clear
so
typical
nor
so
determined
as
when
taken
by
women
section
judgment
avenarius
tells
of
an
english
couple
who
were
speaking
about
wings
it
was
the
opinion
that
this
angelic
possession
was
doubtful
the
that
it
could
not
be
many
a
woman
witness
has
reminded
me
of
this
story
and
i
have
been
able
to
explain
by
use
of
it
many
an
event
woman
says
must
when
she
knows
of
no
reason
must
when
her
own
arguments
bore
her
must
when
she
is
confused
when
she
does
not
understand
the
evidence
of
her
opponent
and
particularly
when
she
desires
something
unfortunately
she
hides
this
attitude
under
many
words
and
one
often
wishes
for
the
simple
assertion
of
the
english
woman
must
in
consequence
when
we
want
to
learn
their
ratio
sciendi
from
women
we
get
into
difficulties
they
offer
us
a
collection
of
frequently
astonishing
and
important
things
but
when
we
ask
for
the
source
of
this
collection
we
get
must
be
in
variations
from
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
to
a
flood
of
words
the
inexperienced
judge
may
be
deceived
by
the
positiveness
of
such
expressions
and
believe
that
such
certainty
must
be
based
on
something
which
the
witness
can
not
utter
through
lack
of
skill
if
now
the
judge
is
going
to
help
the
witness
with
course
you
mean
because
or
because
the
witness
if
she
is
not
a
fool
will
say
thus
we
get
apparently
assertions
which
are
really
founded
on
nothing
more
than
must
cases
dealing
with
divisions
distinctions
and
analysis
rarely
contain
ungrounded
assertions
by
women
women
are
well
able
to
analyse
and
explain
data
and
what
one
is
capable
of
and
understands
one
succeeds
in
justifying
their
difficulty
is
in
synthetic
work
in
progressive
movement
and
there
they
simply
assert
the
few
observations
of
this
characteristic
confirm
this
statement
for
example
lafitte
says
that
at
medical
examinations
women
are
unable
to
do
anything
which
requires
synthetic
power
judgments
of
men
further
confirm
this
position
for
they
are
said
to
be
more
impressed
with
a
minimal
success
than
with
a
most
magnificent
effort
now
there
is
no
injustice
no
superficiality
in
this
observation
its
object
is
simply
parallel
to
their
incapacity
for
synthesis
inasmuch
as
they
are
able
to
follow
particular
things
they
will
understand
a
single
success
but
the
growth
of
efficiency
toward
the
future
requires
composition
and
wide
horizon
hence
they
can
not
understand
it
hence
also
the
curious
contradictions
in
statements
as
suspicion
rises
and
falls
a
woman
who
knows
of
a
hundred
reasons
for
the
guilt
of
some
prisoner
tries
to
turn
everything
the
other
way
when
she
later
learns
that
the
prisoner
has
succeeded
in
producing
some
apparent
alibi
so
again
if
the
prosecution
seems
to
be
successful
the
women
witnesses
for
the
defence
often
become
the
most
dangerous
for
the
defenders
but
here
also
women
find
a
limit
perhaps
because
like
all
weaklings
they
are
afraid
to
draw
the
ultimate
conclusions
as
leroux
says
in
criminals
were
left
to
women
they
would
kill
them
all
in
the
first
burst
of
anger
and
if
one
waited
until
this
burst
had
subsided
they
would
release
them
the
killing
points
to
the
easy
excitability
the
passionateness
and
the
instinctive
sense
of
justice
in
women
which
demands
immediate
revenge
for
evil
deeds
the
liberation
points
to
the
fact
that
women
are
afraid
of
every
energetic
deduction
of
ultimate
consequences
they
have
no
knowledge
of
real
justice
look
for
reasons
women
judge
by
love
women
can
love
and
hate
but
they
can
not
be
just
without
loving
nor
can
they
ever
learn
to
value
so
says
schiller
and
how
frequently
do
we
not
hear
the
question
whether
the
fate
is
going
to
depend
on
her
evidence
if
we
say
yes
there
is
as
a
rule
a
restriction
of
testimony
a
titillation
and
twisting
of
consequences
and
this
circumstance
must
always
be
remembered
if
you
want
to
get
truth
from
a
woman
you
must
know
the
proper
time
to
begin
and
what
is
more
important
when
to
stop
as
the
old
proverb
says
and
it
is
one
to
take
to
heart
are
wise
when
they
act
unconsciously
fools
when
they
it
is
a
familiar
fact
that
women
committing
crimes
go
to
extremes
it
may
be
correct
to
adduce
as
modern
writers
do
the
weakness
of
feminine
intelligence
to
social
conditions
and
it
may
perhaps
be
for
this
reason
that
the
future
of
woman
lies
in
changing
the
feminine
milieu
but
also
with
regard
to
environment
she
is
an
extremist
the
most
pious
woman
as
richelieu
says
will
not
hesitate
to
kill
a
troublesome
witness
the
most
complicated
crimes
are
characteristically
planned
by
women
and
are
frequently
swelled
with
a
number
of
absolutely
purposeless
criminal
deeds
in
this
circumstance
we
sometimes
find
the
explanation
for
an
otherwise
unintelligible
crime
which
perhaps
indicates
also
that
the
first
crime
was
committed
by
woman
it
is
as
if
she
has
in
turpitude
a
certain
pleasure
to
which
she
abandons
herself
as
soon
as
she
has
passed
the
limit
in
her
first
crime
section
quarrels
with
women
this
little
matter
is
intended
only
for
very
young
and
inexperienced
criminal
justices
there
is
nothing
more
exciting
or
instructive
than
a
quarrel
with
clever
and
trained
women
concerning
worthy
subjects
but
this
does
not
happen
in
court
and
ninety
per
cent
of
our
woman
witnesses
are
not
to
be
quarrelled
with
there
are
two
occasions
on
which
a
quarrel
may
arise
the
first
when
we
are
trying
to
show
a
denying
prisoner
that
her
crime
has
already
been
proved
and
that
her
denials
are
silly
and
the
second
when
we
are
trying
to
show
a
witness
that
she
must
know
something
although
she
refuses
to
know
it
or
when
we
want
to
show
her
the
incorrectness
of
her
conclusion
or
when
we
want
to
lead
her
to
a
point
where
her
testimony
can
have
further
value
now
a
verbal
quarrel
will
hurt
the
case
this
is
a
matter
of
ancient
experience
for
whoever
quarrels
with
women
is
as
b√∂rne
says
in
the
condition
of
a
man
who
must
unceasingly
polish
lights
women
have
an
obstinacy
and
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
be
passive
against
it
but
in
the
interest
of
justice
the
part
of
the
wise
is
not
to
lose
any
time
by
making
an
exhibition
of
himself
through
verbal
quarrels
with
women
witnesses
the
judge
may
be
thoroughly
convinced
that
his
success
with
the
woman
may
help
the
case
but
such
success
is
very
rare
and
when
he
thinks
he
has
it
it
is
only
apparent
and
momentary
or
is
merely
na√Øve
for
women
do
like
for
the
sake
of
a
momentary
advantage
to
please
men
and
to
appear
convinced
but
the
judge
for
whom
a
woman
does
this
is
in
a
state
that
requires
consideration
a
few
more
particulars
concerning
feminine
intelligence
they
are
however
only
indirectly
connected
with
it
and
are
as
unintelligible
as
the
fact
that
is
more
frequent
and
less
frequent
among
women
than
among
men
if
however
we
are
to
explain
feminine
intelligence
at
all
we
must
do
so
by
conceiving
that
intellectual
functioning
stops
at
a
definite
point
and
can
not
pass
beyond
it
consider
their
attitude
toward
money
however
distasteful
mammon
may
be
in
himself
money
is
so
important
a
factor
in
life
itself
that
it
is
not
unintelligibly
spoken
of
as
the
of
cold
but
to
make
incorrect
use
of
an
important
thing
is
to
be
unintelligent
whoever
wastes
money
is
not
intelligent
enough
to
understand
what
important
pleasures
he
may
provide
for
himself
and
whoever
hoards
it
does
not
know
its
proper
use
now
single
women
are
either
hoarders
or
wasters
they
rarely
take
the
middle
way
and
assume
the
prudence
of
the
housewife
which
generally
develops
into
miserliness
this
is
best
observable
in
the
foolish
bargaining
of
women
at
markets
in
their
supposing
that
they
have
done
great
things
by
having
reduced
the
price
of
their
purchase
a
few
cents
every
dealer
confirms
the
fact
that
the
first
price
he
quotes
a
woman
is
increased
in
order
to
give
her
a
chance
to
bargain
but
she
does
not
bargain
down
to
the
proper
price
she
bargains
down
to
a
sum
above
the
proper
price
and
she
frequently
buys
unnecessary
or
inferior
things
simply
because
the
dealer
was
smart
enough
to
captivate
her
by
allowing
reductions
this
is
indicated
in
a
certain
criminal
case
in
which
the
asserted
that
she
immediately
suspected
a
customer
of
passing
counterfeit
coins
because
she
did
not
bargain
now
this
tendency
to
hoard
is
not
essentially
miserliness
for
the
chief
purpose
of
miserliness
is
to
bring
together
and
to
own
money
to
enjoy
merely
the
look
of
it
this
tendency
is
an
unintelligent
attitude
toward
money
a
failure
to
judge
its
value
and
properties
now
this
failure
is
one
of
the
principal
reasons
for
numerous
crimes
a
woman
needing
money
for
her
thousand
several
objects
demands
it
from
her
husband
and
the
latter
has
to
provide
it
without
her
asking
whether
he
honestly
can
or
not
a
wife
is
said
to
be
uncurious
only
with
regard
to
the
source
of
her
money
she
knows
his
income
she
knows
the
necessary
annual
expenses
she
can
immediately
count
up
the
fact
that
the
two
are
equal
but
she
calmly
asks
for
more
of
course
i
am
not
referring
to
the
courageous
helpmeet
who
stands
by
her
husband
in
bearing
the
burdens
of
life
with
her
the
criminalist
has
nothing
to
do
i
mean
only
those
women
who
nowadays
make
the
great
majority
and
that
army
of
who
have
cost
the
country
a
countless
number
of
not
unworthy
men
the
love
of
women
is
the
key
to
many
a
crime
even
murder
theft
swindling
and
treachery
first
there
is
the
unintelligible
arithmetic
then
her
ceaseless
requirements
finally
the
surrender
to
the
limit
of
his
powers
then
fresh
demands
a
long
period
of
opposition
then
surrender
and
finally
one
unlawful
action
from
that
it
is
only
a
step
to
a
great
crime
this
is
the
simple
theme
of
the
countless
variations
that
are
played
in
the
criminal
court
there
are
proverbs
enough
to
show
how
thoroughly
the
public
understands
this
connection
between
love
and
money
an
apparently
insignificant
feminine
quality
which
is
connected
with
her
intelligence
is
her
notorious
quite
the
criminalist
meets
this
when
he
is
looking
for
an
explanation
of
the
failure
of
some
probably
extraordinarily
intelligent
plan
of
crime
or
when
a
crime
occurs
which
might
have
been
prevented
by
a
step
at
the
right
minute
women
are
always
ten
minutes
behind
the
time
but
these
minutes
would
not
be
gained
if
things
were
begun
ten
minutes
earlier
and
once
a
woman
suffers
real
damage
through
tardiness
she
resolves
to
be
ten
minutes
ahead
of
time
but
when
she
does
so
she
fails
in
her
resolution
and
this
failure
is
to
be
explained
by
lack
of
intelligence
the
little
fact
that
women
are
never
quite
on
time
explains
many
a
difficulty
feminine
conservatism
is
as
insignificant
as
feminine
punctuality
lombroso
shows
how
attached
women
are
to
old
things
ideas
jewelry
verses
superstitions
and
proverbs
are
better
retained
by
women
than
by
men
nobody
would
venture
to
assert
that
a
conservative
man
must
be
less
intelligent
than
a
liberal
yet
feminine
conservatism
indicates
a
certain
stupidity
less
excitability
and
smaller
capacity
for
accepting
new
impressions
women
have
a
certain
difficulty
in
assimilating
and
reconstructing
things
and
because
of
this
difficulty
they
do
not
like
to
surrender
an
object
after
having
received
it
hence
it
is
well
not
to
be
too
free
with
the
more
honorable
attributes
such
as
piety
love
loyalty
respect
to
what
they
have
already
learned
closer
investigation
discovers
altogether
too
many
instances
of
intellectual
rigidity
in
our
profession
we
meet
the
fact
frequently
that
men
pass
much
more
easily
from
honesty
to
dishonesty
and
vice
versa
that
they
more
easily
change
their
habits
begin
new
plans
etc
generalizations
of
course
can
not
be
made
each
case
has
to
be
studied
on
its
merits
yet
even
when
questions
of
fact
arise
in
searching
houses
it
is
well
to
remember
the
distinction
old
letters
real
corpora
delicti
are
much
more
likely
to
be
found
in
the
box
than
in
the
the
latter
has
destroyed
the
thing
long
ago
but
the
former
may
of
have
preserved
for
years
even
the
poison
she
once
used
to
commit
murder
with
section
b
honesty
we
shall
speak
here
only
of
the
honesty
of
the
sort
of
women
the
courts
have
most
to
do
with
and
in
this
regard
there
is
little
to
give
us
joy
not
to
be
honest
and
to
lie
are
two
different
things
the
latter
is
positive
the
former
negative
the
dishonest
person
does
not
tell
the
truth
the
liar
tells
the
untruth
it
is
dishonest
to
suppress
a
portion
of
the
truth
to
lead
others
into
mistakes
to
fail
to
justify
appearances
and
to
make
use
of
appearances
the
dishonest
person
may
not
have
said
a
single
untrue
word
and
still
have
introduced
many
more
difficulties
confusions
and
deceptions
than
the
liar
he
is
for
this
reason
more
dangerous
than
the
latter
also
because
his
conduct
is
more
difficult
to
uncover
and
because
he
is
more
difficult
to
conquer
than
the
liar
dishonesty
is
however
a
specially
feminine
characteristic
and
in
men
occurs
only
when
they
are
effeminate
real
manliness
and
dishonesty
are
concepts
which
can
not
be
united
hence
the
popular
proverb
says
always
tell
the
truth
but
not
the
whole
and
this
is
more
accurate
than
the
accusation
of
many
writers
that
women
lie
i
do
not
believe
that
the
criminal
courts
can
verify
the
latter
accusation
i
do
not
mean
that
women
never
lie
they
lie
enough
but
they
do
not
lie
more
than
men
do
and
none
of
us
would
attribute
lying
to
women
as
a
sexual
trait
to
do
so
would
be
to
confuse
dishonesty
with
lying
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
deal
too
sternly
in
court
with
the
dishonesty
of
women
for
we
ourselves
and
social
conditions
are
responsible
for
much
of
it
we
dislike
to
use
the
right
names
of
things
and
choose
rather
to
suggest
to
remain
in
embarrassed
silence
or
to
blush
hence
it
is
too
much
to
ask
that
this
should
be
set
aside
in
the
courtroom
where
circumstances
make
straight
talking
even
more
difficult
according
to
lombroso
women
lie
because
of
their
weaknesses
and
because
of
menstruation
and
pregnancy
for
which
they
have
in
conversation
to
substitute
other
illnesses
because
of
the
feeling
of
shame
because
of
the
sexual
selection
which
compels
them
to
conceal
age
defects
diseases
because
finally
of
their
desire
to
be
interesting
their
suggestibility
and
their
small
powers
of
judgment
all
these
things
tend
to
make
them
lie
and
then
as
mothers
they
have
to
deceive
their
children
about
many
things
indeed
they
are
themselves
no
more
than
children
lombroso
concludes
but
it
is
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
these
conditions
lead
to
lying
for
women
generally
acquire
silence
some
other
form
of
action
or
the
negative
propagation
of
error
but
this
is
essentially
dishonesty
to
assert
that
deception
lying
have
become
physiological
properties
of
women
is
therefore
wrong
according
to
lotze
women
hate
analysis
and
hence
can
not
distinguish
between
the
true
and
the
false
but
then
women
hate
analysis
only
when
it
is
applied
to
themselves
a
woman
does
not
want
to
be
analyzed
herself
simply
because
analysis
would
reveal
a
great
deal
of
dishonesty
she
is
therefore
a
stranger
to
honest
activity
but
for
this
men
are
to
blame
nobody
as
flaubert
says
tells
women
the
truth
and
when
once
they
hear
it
they
fight
it
as
something
extraordinary
they
are
not
even
honest
with
themselves
but
this
is
not
only
true
in
general
it
is
true
also
in
particular
cases
which
the
court
room
sees
we
ourselves
make
honesty
difficult
to
women
before
the
court
of
course
i
do
not
mean
that
to
avoid
this
we
are
to
be
rude
and
shameless
in
our
conversation
with
women
but
it
is
certain
that
we
compel
them
to
be
dishonest
by
our
handling
of
every
ticklish
subject
any
criminal
justice
knows
that
much
more
progress
can
be
made
by
simple
and
absolutely
open
discussion
a
highly
educated
woman
with
whom
i
had
a
frank
talk
about
such
a
matter
said
at
the
end
of
this
very
painful
sitting
god
that
you
spoke
frankly
and
without
prudery
i
was
very
much
afraid
that
by
foolish
questions
you
might
compel
me
to
prudish
answers
and
hence
to
complete
we
have
led
women
so
far
by
our
indirection
that
according
to
stendhal
to
be
honest
is
to
them
identical
with
appearing
naked
in
public
balzac
asks
you
ever
observed
a
lie
in
the
attitude
and
manner
of
woman
deceit
is
as
easy
to
them
as
falling
snow
in
but
this
is
true
only
if
he
means
dishonesty
it
is
not
true
that
it
is
easy
for
women
really
to
lie
i
do
not
know
whether
this
fact
can
be
proven
but
i
am
sure
the
feminine
malease
in
lying
can
be
observed
the
play
of
features
the
eyes
the
breast
the
attitude
betrays
almost
always
even
the
experienced
female
offender
now
nothing
can
reveal
the
play
of
her
essential
dishonesty
if
a
man
once
confesses
he
confesses
with
less
constraint
than
a
woman
and
he
is
less
likely
even
if
he
is
very
bad
to
take
advantage
of
false
favorable
appearances
while
woman
accepts
them
with
the
semblance
of
innocence
if
a
man
has
not
altogether
given
a
complete
version
his
failure
is
easy
to
recognize
by
his
hesitation
but
the
opinions
of
woman
always
have
a
definite
goal
even
though
she
should
tell
us
only
a
tenth
of
what
she
might
know
and
say
even
her
simplest
affirmation
or
denial
is
not
honest
her
is
not
definite
her
to
a
demands
still
further
when
a
man
affirms
or
denies
and
there
is
some
limitation
to
his
assertion
he
either
announces
it
expressly
or
the
more
trained
ear
recognizes
its
presence
in
the
failure
to
conclude
in
a
hesitation
of
the
tone
but
the
woman
says
and
even
when
only
a
small
portion
of
one
or
the
other
asserts
a
truth
behind
which
she
can
hide
herself
and
this
is
a
matter
to
keep
in
mind
in
the
courtroom
also
the
art
of
deception
or
concealment
depends
on
dishonesty
rather
than
on
pure
deceit
because
it
consists
much
more
in
the
use
of
whatever
is
at
hand
and
in
suppression
of
material
than
on
direct
lies
so
when
the
proverb
says
that
a
woman
was
ill
only
three
times
during
the
course
of
the
year
but
each
time
for
four
months
it
will
be
unjust
to
say
that
she
intentionally
denies
a
illness
she
does
not
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
is
ill
at
least
thirteen
times
a
year
and
besides
her
weak
physique
causes
her
to
feel
frequently
unwell
so
she
does
not
lie
about
her
illness
but
then
she
does
not
immediately
announce
her
recovery
and
permits
people
to
nurse
and
protect
her
even
when
she
has
no
need
of
it
perhaps
she
does
so
because
in
the
course
of
the
centuries
she
found
it
necessary
to
magnify
her
little
troubles
in
order
to
protect
herself
against
brutal
men
and
had
therefore
to
forge
the
weapon
of
dishonesty
so
schopenhauer
agrees
has
given
women
only
one
means
of
protection
and
defence
hypocrisy
this
is
congenital
with
them
and
the
use
of
it
is
as
natural
as
the
use
of
its
claws
women
feel
they
have
a
certain
degree
of
justification
for
their
with
this
hypocrisy
we
have
as
lawyers
to
wage
a
constant
battle
quite
apart
from
the
various
ills
and
diseases
which
women
assume
before
the
judge
everything
else
is
pretended
innocence
love
of
children
spouses
and
parents
pain
at
loss
and
despair
at
reproaches
a
breaking
heart
at
separation
and
piety
in
short
whatever
may
be
useful
this
subjects
the
examining
justice
to
the
dangers
and
difficulties
of
being
either
too
harsh
or
being
fooled
he
can
save
himself
much
trouble
by
remembering
that
in
this
simulation
there
is
much
dishonesty
and
few
lies
the
simulation
is
rarely
it
is
an
intensification
of
something
actually
there
and
now
think
of
the
tears
which
are
wept
before
every
man
and
not
least
before
the
criminal
judge
popular
proverbs
tend
to
undervalue
often
to
distrust
tearful
women
mantegazza
points
out
that
every
man
over
thirty
can
recall
scenes
in
which
it
was
difficult
to
determine
how
much
of
a
tears
meant
real
pain
and
how
much
was
voluntarily
shed
in
the
notion
that
tears
represent
a
mixture
of
poetry
and
truth
we
shall
find
the
correct
solution
it
would
be
interesting
to
question
female
virtuosos
in
tears
when
women
see
that
they
can
really
teach
they
are
quite
often
honest
about
the
matter
the
questioner
would
inevitably
learn
that
it
is
impossible
to
weep
at
will
and
without
reason
only
a
child
can
do
that
tears
require
a
definite
reason
and
a
certain
amount
of
time
which
may
be
reduced
by
great
practice
to
a
minimum
but
even
that
minimum
requires
some
duration
stories
in
novels
and
comic
papers
in
which
women
weep
bitterly
about
a
denied
new
coat
are
fairy
tales
in
point
of
fact
the
lady
begins
by
feeling
hurt
because
her
husband
refused
to
buy
her
the
thing
then
she
thinks
that
he
has
recently
refused
to
buy
her
a
dress
and
to
take
her
to
the
theatre
that
at
the
same
time
he
looks
unfriendly
and
walks
away
to
the
window
that
indeed
she
is
really
a
pitiful
misunderstood
immeasurably
unhappy
woman
and
after
this
crescendo
which
often
occurs
presto
prestissimo
the
stream
of
tears
breaks
through
some
tiny
reason
a
little
time
a
little
and
a
little
imagination
these
can
keep
every
woman
weeping
eternally
and
these
tears
can
always
leave
us
cold
beware
however
of
the
silent
tears
of
real
pain
especially
of
hurt
innocence
these
must
not
be
mistaken
for
the
first
if
they
are
much
harm
may
be
done
for
these
tears
if
they
do
not
represent
penitence
for
guilt
are
real
evidences
of
innocence
i
once
believed
that
the
surest
mark
of
such
tears
was
the
deceiving
attempt
to
beat
down
and
suppress
them
an
attempt
which
is
made
with
elementary
vigor
but
even
this
attempt
to
fight
them
off
is
frequently
not
quite
real
as
with
tears
so
with
fainting
the
greater
number
of
fainting
fits
are
either
altogether
false
or
something
between
fainting
and
wakefulness
women
certainly
whether
as
prisoners
or
witnesses
are
often
very
uncomfortable
in
court
and
if
the
discomfort
is
followed
immediately
by
illness
dizziness
and
great
fear
fainting
is
natural
if
only
a
little
exaggeration
relaxation
and
the
attempt
to
dodge
the
unpleasant
circumstance
are
added
then
the
fainting
fit
is
ready
to
order
and
the
effect
is
generally
in
favor
of
the
fainter
although
it
is
wrong
to
assume
beforehand
that
fainting
is
a
comedy
it
is
necessary
to
beware
of
deception
an
interesting
question
which
thank
heaven
does
not
concern
the
criminal
justice
is
whether
women
can
keep
their
word
when
a
criminalist
permits
a
woman
to
promise
not
to
tell
anybody
else
of
her
testimony
or
some
similar
na√Øvet√©
he
may
settle
his
account
with
his
conscience
the
criminalist
must
not
accept
promises
at
all
and
he
is
only
getting
his
reward
when
women
fool
him
the
fact
is
that
woman
does
not
know
the
definite
line
between
right
and
wrong
or
better
she
draws
the
line
in
a
different
way
sometimes
more
sharply
but
in
the
main
more
broadly
than
man
and
in
many
cases
she
does
not
at
all
understand
that
certain
distinctions
are
not
permitted
this
occurs
chiefly
where
the
boundaries
are
really
unstable
or
where
it
is
not
easy
to
understand
the
personality
of
the
sufferer
hence
it
is
always
difficult
to
make
woman
understand
that
state
community
or
other
public
weal
must
in
and
for
themselves
be
sacred
against
all
harm
the
most
honest
and
pious
woman
is
not
only
without
conscience
with
regard
to
dodging
her
taxes
she
also
finds
great
pleasure
in
having
done
so
successfully
it
does
not
matter
what
it
is
she
smuggles
she
is
glad
to
smuggle
successfully
but
smuggling
is
not
as
might
be
supposed
a
sport
for
women
though
women
need
more
nervous
excitement
and
sport
than
men
their
attitude
shows
that
they
are
really
unable
to
see
that
they
are
running
into
danger
because
they
are
violating
the
law
when
you
tell
them
that
the
state
is
justified
in
forbidding
smuggling
they
always
answer
that
they
have
smuggled
such
a
very
little
that
nobody
would
miss
the
duties
then
the
interest
in
smugglers
and
is
exceedingly
great
we
once
had
a
girl
who
was
born
on
the
boundary
between
italy
and
austria
her
father
was
a
notorious
smuggler
the
chief
of
a
band
that
brought
coffee
and
silk
across
the
border
he
grew
rich
in
the
trade
but
he
lost
everything
in
an
especially
great
venture
and
was
finally
shot
by
the
at
the
boundary
if
you
could
see
with
what
interest
spirit
and
keenness
the
girl
described
her
dubious
courses
you
would
recognize
that
she
had
not
the
slightest
idea
that
there
was
anything
wrong
in
what
he
was
doing
women
moreover
do
not
understand
the
least
regulation
i
frequently
have
had
cases
in
which
even
intelligent
women
could
not
see
why
it
was
wrong
to
make
a
change
in
a
public
register
why
it
was
wrong
to
give
in
a
foreign
city
a
false
name
at
the
hotel
or
why
the
police
might
forbid
the
shaking
of
over
the
heads
of
pedestrians
even
from
her
house
why
the
dog
must
be
kept
chained
and
what
good
such
could
do
anyway
again
tiny
bits
of
private
property
are
not
safe
from
women
note
how
impossible
it
is
to
make
women
understand
that
private
property
is
despoiled
when
flowers
or
fruit
are
plucked
from
a
private
garden
the
point
is
so
small
and
as
a
rule
the
property
owner
makes
no
objections
but
it
must
be
granted
that
he
has
the
right
to
do
so
then
their
tendency
to
steal
in
the
country
bits
of
ground
and
boundaries
is
well
known
most
of
the
boundary
cases
we
have
involved
the
activity
of
some
woman
even
in
their
own
homes
women
do
not
conceive
property
too
rigidly
they
appropriate
pen
paper
pencils
clothes
without
having
any
idea
of
replacing
what
they
have
taken
away
this
may
be
confirmed
by
anybody
whose
desk
is
not
habitually
sacrosanct
and
he
will
agree
that
it
is
not
slovenliness
but
defective
sense
of
property
that
causes
women
to
do
this
for
even
the
most
consummate
housekeepers
do
so
this
defective
is
most
clearly
shown
in
the
notorious
fact
that
women
cheat
at
cards
according
to
lombroso
an
educated
much
experienced
woman
told
him
in
confidence
that
it
is
difficult
for
her
sex
not
to
cheat
at
cards
croupiers
in
gambling
halls
know
things
much
worse
they
say
that
they
must
watch
women
much
more
than
men
because
they
are
not
only
more
frequent
cheaters
but
more
expert
even
at
croquet
and
girls
are
unspeakably
smart
about
cheating
if
they
can
thereby
put
their
masculine
opponents
impudently
at
a
disadvantage
we
find
many
women
among
swindlers
gamblers
and
counterfeiters
and
moreover
we
have
the
evidence
of
experienced
housewives
that
the
cleverest
and
most
useful
servants
are
frequently
thievish
what
is
instructive
in
all
these
facts
is
the
indefiniteness
of
the
boundary
between
honesty
and
dishonesty
even
in
the
most
petty
cases
the
defect
in
the
sense
of
property
with
regard
to
little
things
explains
how
many
a
woman
became
a
criminal
the
road
she
wandered
on
grew
step
by
step
more
extended
there
being
no
definite
boundary
it
was
inevitable
that
women
should
go
very
far
and
when
the
educated
woman
does
nothing
more
than
to
steal
a
pencil
from
her
husband
and
to
cheat
at
whist
her
sole
fortune
is
that
she
does
not
get
opportunities
or
needs
for
more
serious
mistakes
the
uneducated
woman
has
however
both
opportunity
and
need
and
crime
becomes
very
easy
to
her
our
life
is
rich
in
experiment
and
our
will
too
weak
not
to
fail
under
the
exigencies
of
existence
if
at
the
outset
a
slightest
deviation
from
the
straight
and
narrow
road
is
not
avoided
if
the
justice
is
in
doubt
whether
a
woman
has
committed
a
great
crime
against
property
his
study
will
concern
not
the
deed
but
the
time
when
the
woman
was
in
different
circumstances
and
had
no
other
opportunity
to
do
wrong
than
mere
nibbling
at
and
otherwise
foolish
abstractions
from
other
property
if
this
inclination
can
be
proved
then
there
is
justification
for
at
least
suspecting
her
of
the
greater
crime
the
relation
of
women
to
such
devilment
becomes
more
instructive
when
it
has
to
be
discovered
through
woman
witnesses
as
a
rule
there
is
no
justification
for
the
assumption
that
people
are
inclined
to
excuse
whatever
they
find
themselves
guilty
of
on
the
contrary
we
are
inclined
to
punish
others
most
harshly
where
we
ourselves
are
most
guilty
and
there
is
still
another
side
to
the
matter
when
an
honest
woman
commits
petty
crimes
she
does
not
consider
them
as
crimes
she
is
unaware
of
their
immorality
and
it
would
be
illogical
for
her
to
see
as
a
crime
in
others
that
which
she
does
not
recognize
as
a
crime
in
herself
it
is
for
this
reason
that
she
tends
to
excuse
her
derelictions
now
when
we
try
to
find
out
from
feminine
witnesses
facts
concerning
the
objects
on
which
we
properly
lay
stress
they
do
not
answer
and
cause
us
to
make
mistakes
what
woman
thinks
is
mere
in
her
servant
girl
is
larceny
in
criminal
law
what
she
calls
we
call
deceit
or
violation
of
trust
for
the
man
whom
the
woman
calls
dragon
we
find
in
many
cases
quite
different
terms
and
this
feminine
attitude
is
not
christian
charity
but
ignorance
of
the
law
and
with
this
ignorance
we
have
to
count
when
we
examine
witnesses
of
course
not
only
concerning
some
theft
by
a
servant
girl
but
always
when
we
are
trying
to
understand
some
human
weakness
from
honesty
to
loyalty
is
but
a
step
often
these
traits
lie
side
by
side
or
overlap
each
other
now
the
criminal
justice
has
more
frequently
than
appears
to
deal
with
feminine
loyalty
problems
of
adultery
are
generally
of
subordinate
significance
only
but
this
loyalty
or
disloyalty
often
plays
the
most
important
r√¥le
in
trials
of
all
conceivable
crimes
and
the
whole
problem
of
evidence
takes
a
different
form
according
to
the
assumption
that
this
loyalty
does
or
does
not
exist
whether
it
is
the
murder
of
a
husband
doubtful
suicide
physical
mutilation
theft
perversion
of
trust
arson
the
case
takes
a
different
form
if
feminine
disloyalty
can
be
proved
the
rare
reference
to
this
important
premise
in
the
presentation
of
evidence
is
due
to
the
fact
that
we
are
ignorant
of
its
significance
that
its
determinative
factors
are
hidden
and
finally
that
its
presentation
is
as
a
rule
difficult
public
opinion
on
feminine
loyalty
is
not
flattering
diderot
asserts
that
there
is
no
loyal
woman
who
has
not
ceased
being
so
at
least
in
her
imagination
of
course
this
does
not
mean
much
for
all
of
us
have
ideally
committed
many
sins
but
if
diderot
is
right
one
may
assume
a
feminine
inclination
to
disloyalty
most
responsible
for
this
is
of
course
the
purely
sexual
character
of
woman
but
we
must
not
do
her
the
injustice
and
ourselves
the
harm
of
supposing
that
this
character
is
the
sole
regulative
principle
the
illimitable
feminine
need
for
change
is
also
responsible
to
a
great
degree
i
doubt
whether
it
could
be
proved
in
any
collection
of
cases
worth
naming
that
a
woman
grew
disloyal
although
her
sexual
needs
were
small
but
that
her
sex
does
so
is
certain
and
thence
we
must
seek
other
reasons
for
their
disloyalty
the
love
of
change
is
fundamental
and
may
be
observed
in
recorded
criminal
cases
educated
women
says
goltz
not
bear
continuous
and
uniform
good
fortune
and
feel
an
inconceivable
impulse
to
devilment
and
foolishness
in
order
to
get
some
variety
in
now
it
will
be
much
easier
for
the
judge
to
determine
whether
the
woman
in
the
case
had
at
the
critical
time
an
especial
inclination
to
this
than
to
discover
whether
her
own
husband
was
sexually
insufficient
or
whatever
similar
secrets
might
be
involved
if
woman
however
once
has
the
impulse
to
seek
variety
and
the
harmless
and
permissible
changes
she
may
provide
herself
are
no
longer
sufficient
or
are
lacking
the
movement
of
her
daily
life
takes
a
questionable
direction
then
there
is
a
certain
tendency
to
deceit
which
is
able
to
bring
its
particular
consequences
to
bear
a
woman
has
married
let
us
say
for
love
or
for
money
for
spite
to
please
her
parents
etc
now
come
moments
in
her
life
in
which
she
reflects
concerning
reason
for
marriage
and
the
cause
of
these
moments
will
almost
always
be
her
husband
he
may
have
been
have
demanded
too
much
have
refused
something
have
neglected
her
and
thus
have
wounded
her
so
that
her
mood
when
thinking
of
the
reason
of
her
marriage
is
decidedly
bad
and
she
begins
to
doubt
whether
her
love
was
really
so
strong
whether
the
money
was
worth
the
trouble
whether
she
ought
not
to
have
opposed
her
parents
etc
and
suppose
she
had
waited
might
she
not
have
done
better
had
she
not
deserved
better
every
step
in
her
musing
takes
her
farther
from
her
husband
a
man
is
nothing
to
a
woman
to
whom
he
is
not
everything
and
if
he
is
nothing
he
deserves
no
especial
consideration
and
if
he
is
undeserving
a
little
disloyalty
is
not
so
terrible
and
finally
the
little
disloyalty
gradually
and
naturally
and
smoothly
leads
to
adultery
and
adultery
to
a
chain
of
crimes
that
this
process
is
not
a
thousand
times
more
frequent
is
merely
due
to
the
accident
that
the
right
man
is
not
at
hand
during
these
weak
moments
millions
of
women
who
boast
of
their
virtue
and
scorn
others
most
nobly
have
to
thank
their
boasted
virtue
only
to
this
accident
if
the
right
man
had
been
present
at
the
right
time
they
would
have
had
no
more
ground
for
pride
there
is
only
a
simple
and
safe
method
for
discovering
whether
a
woman
is
loyal
to
her
husband
lead
her
to
say
whether
her
husband
neglects
her
every
woman
who
complains
that
her
husband
neglects
her
is
an
adulteress
or
in
the
way
of
becoming
one
for
she
seeks
the
most
thrifty
the
really
sound
reason
which
would
justify
adultery
how
close
she
has
come
to
this
sin
is
easily
discoverable
from
the
degree
of
intensity
with
which
she
accuses
her
husband
besides
adultery
the
disloyalty
of
widow
and
of
bride
there
is
also
another
sense
in
which
disloyalty
may
be
important
the
first
is
important
only
when
we
have
to
infer
some
earlier
condition
and
we
are
likely
to
commit
injustice
if
we
judge
the
conduct
of
the
wife
by
the
conduct
of
the
widow
as
a
rule
there
are
no
means
of
comparison
in
numerous
cases
the
wife
loves
her
husband
and
is
loyal
to
him
even
beyond
the
grave
but
these
cases
always
involve
older
women
whom
lust
no
longer
affects
if
the
widow
is
at
all
young
pretty
and
comparatively
rich
she
forgets
her
husband
if
she
has
forgotten
him
if
after
a
very
short
time
she
has
again
found
a
lover
and
a
husband
whether
for
sake
of
the
poor
children
or
because
first
one
of
blessed
memory
desired
it
or
because
second
and
the
first
look
so
much
alike
or
whatever
other
reason
she
might
give
there
is
still
no
ground
for
supposing
that
she
did
not
love
her
first
husband
was
disloyal
to
him
robbed
and
murdered
him
she
might
have
borne
the
happiest
relations
with
him
but
he
is
dead
and
a
dead
man
is
no
man
there
are
again
cases
in
which
the
almost
immediate
marriage
of
a
widow
implies
all
kinds
of
things
and
often
reveals
in
the
person
of
the
second
husband
the
murderer
of
the
first
when
suspicions
of
such
a
situation
occur
it
is
obviously
necessary
to
go
very
slowly
but
the
first
thing
of
importance
is
to
keep
tabs
carefully
on
the
second
husband
it
is
exceedingly
in
a
man
to
marry
a
woman
he
knows
to
have
murdered
her
first
husband
but
if
he
had
cared
only
about
being
her
lover
there
would
not
have
been
the
necessity
of
murdering
the
first
the
opposite
of
this
type
is
anticipatory
disloyalty
of
a
woman
who
marries
a
man
in
order
to
carry
on
undisturbed
her
with
another
that
there
are
evil
consequences
in
most
cases
is
easy
to
see
such
marriages
occur
very
frequently
among
peasants
the
woman
is
in
love
with
the
son
of
a
wealthy
widower
the
son
owns
nothing
or
the
father
refuses
his
permission
so
the
woman
makes
a
fool
of
the
father
by
marrying
him
and
carries
on
her
amour
with
the
son
doubly
sinful
instead
of
a
son
the
lover
may
be
only
a
servant
and
then
the
couple
rob
the
husband
thoroughly
especially
if
the
second
wife
has
no
expectations
of
inheritance
there
being
children
of
a
former
marriage
variations
on
this
central
theme
occur
as
the
person
of
the
lover
changes
to
neighbor
cousin
friend
but
the
type
is
obvious
and
it
is
necessary
to
consider
its
possibilities
whenever
suspicion
arises
the
disloyalty
of
a
bride
well
we
will
not
bother
with
this
poetical
subject
everybody
knows
how
merciless
a
girl
can
be
how
she
leaves
her
lover
for
practical
or
otherwise
ignoble
reasons
and
everybody
knows
the
consequences
of
such
things
section
c
love
hate
and
friendship
if
emerson
is
right
and
love
is
no
more
than
the
deification
of
persons
the
criminalist
does
not
need
to
bother
about
this
very
rare
paroxysm
of
the
human
soul
we
might
translate
at
most
a
description
of
her
lover
who
is
possibly
accused
of
some
crime
from
deified
into
human
but
that
is
all
however
we
do
not
find
that
sort
of
love
in
the
law
courts
the
love
we
do
find
has
to
be
translated
into
a
simpler
and
more
common
form
than
that
of
the
poet
the
sense
of
with
which
wagner
endows
his
heroines
is
not
altogether
foreign
in
our
work
we
find
it
among
the
lowest
proletarian
women
who
immolate
themselves
for
their
husbands
follow
them
through
the
most
tremendous
distress
nurse
and
sustain
them
with
hungry
heroism
this
is
more
remarkable
than
poetical
but
it
is
also
different
and
is
to
be
differently
explained
the
conditions
which
cause
love
can
be
understood
in
terms
of
the
effects
and
forces
of
the
daily
life
and
where
we
can
not
see
it
differently
we
shall
be
compelled
to
speak
of
it
as
if
it
were
a
disease
if
disease
is
not
sufficient
explanation
we
shall
have
to
say
with
the

di
love
is
of
greater
importance
in
the
criminal
court
than
the
statutes
allow
and
we
frequently
make
great
mistakes
because
we
do
not
count
it
in
we
have
first
of
all
to
do
our
duty
properly
to
distinguish
the
biological
difference
between
the
human
criminal
and
the
normal
human
being
rather
than
to
subsume
every
criminal
case
under
its
proper
statute
when
a
woman
commits
a
crime
because
of
jealousy
when
in
spite
of
herself
she
throws
herself
away
on
a
when
she
fights

with
unconquerable
hatred
when
she
bears
unbelievable
maltreatment
when

she

has
enough
been
done
when
the
jury
acquits
a
jealous
murderess
or
a
thrower
of
vitriol
such
cases
are
spectacular
but
no
attention
is
paid
to
the
love
of
the
woman
in
the
millions
of
little
cases
where
love
and
love
only
was
the
impulse
and
the
statute
sentencing
her
to
so
and
so
much
punishment
was
the
outcome
now
study
the
force
of
jealousy
and
then
ask
who
is
guilty
of
the
crime
augustine
says
that
whoever
is
not
jealous
is
not
in
love
and
if
love
and
jealousy
are
correlate

may
be
inferred
from
the
other
what
is
at

is
jealousy
what
is
to
to
be
shown

love
that

the
evil
in
the
world
is
due
to
jealousy
but
this
cause
would
be
more
difficult
to
prove

and
we
know
how
difficult
it
is
to
conceal
love
so
difficult
that
it
has
become
a
popular
proverb
that
when
a
woman
has
a
paramour
everybody
knows
it
but
her

now
if
a
crime

been
committed
through

it
would
be

rare
to
discover
and
unreliable
while
her
is
known
to
everybody
once
this
becomes
an
established
fact
we
can
determine
also
the
degree
of
her
jealousy
woman
gives
the
expression
of
her
jealousy
characteristic
direction
man
attempts
to
possess
his
wife
solely
and
without
trouble
and
hence
is
naturally
jealous
the
deceived
woman
turns
all
her
hatred
on
her
rival
and
she
excuses
the
husband
if
only
she
believes
that
she
still
possesses
or
has
regained
his
love
it
will
therefore
be
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
because
a
woman
has
again
begun
to
love
her
husband
perhaps
after
a
jealousy
that
no
such
jealousy
preceded
or
that
she
had
forgiven
her
rival
it
may
be
that
she
has
come
to
an
understanding
with
her
husband
and
no
longer
cares
about
the
rival
but
this
is
only
either
mere
semblance
or
temporary
for
the
first
suspicion
of
danger
turns
loose
the
old
jealousy
with
all
its
consequences
here
again
her
husband
is
safe
and
all
her
rage
is
directed
upon
her
rival
the
typical
cases
are
those
of
the
attacks
by
abandoned
mistresses
at
the
weddings
of
their
lovers
they
always
tear
the
wreath
and
veil
from
the
head
but
it
never
is
said
that
they
knock
the
off
another
characteristic
of
feminine
love
which
often
causes
difficulties
is
the
passion
with
which
the
wife
often
gives
herself
to
her
husband
two
such
different
authors
as
kuno
fischer
and
george
sand
agree
to
this
almost
verbatim
the
first
says
nature
demands
of
woman
is
complete
surrender
to
man
and
the
second
is
a
voluntary
slavery
for
which
woman
craves
by
here
we
find
the
explanation
of
all
those
phenomena
in
which
the
will
of
the
wife
seems
dead
beside
that
of
the
husband
if
a
woman
once
depends
on
a
man
she
follows
him
everywhere
and
even
if
he
commits
the
most
disgusting
crimes
she
helps
him
and
is
his
loyalest
comrade
we
simply
catalogue
the
situation
as
complicity
but
we
have
no
statutes
for
the
fact
that
the
woman
naturally
could
do
nothing
else
we
do
not
find
it
easy
to
discover
the
accomplices
of
a
man
guilty
of
a
crime
but
if
there
is
a
woman
who
really
loves
him
we
may
be
sure
that
she
is
one
of
them
for
the
same
reason
women
often
bear
interminably
long
maltreatment
at
the
hands
of
their
husbands
or
lovers
we
think
of
extraordinary
motives
but
the
whole
thing
is
explained
if
the
motive
was
really
feminine
love
it
will
be
more
difficult
for
us
to
believe
in
this
love
when
the
man
is
physically
and
mentally
not
an
object
of
love
but
the
motives
of
causes
of
love
of
woman
for
man
though
much
discussed
have
never
been
satisfactorily
determined
some
authorities
make
strength
and
courage
the
motives
but
there
are
innumerable
objections
for
historic
lovers
have
been
weak
and
cowardly
intellectual
rather
than
foolish
though
schopenhauer
says
that
intelligence
and
genius
are
distasteful
to
women
no
fixed
reasons
can
be
assigned
we
have
to
accept
the
fact
that
a
most
disgusting
man
is
often
loved
by
a
most
lovely
woman
we
have
to
believe
that
love
of
man
turns
women
from
their
romantic
ideals
there
has
been
the
mistaken
notion
that
only
a
common
crime
compels
a
woman
to
remain
loyally
with
a
thoroughly
worthless
man
and
again
it
has
been
erroneously
supposed
that
a
certain
woman
who
refused
a
most
desirable
heirloom
left
her
by
a
man
must
have
known
of
some
great
crime
committed
by
him
but
we
need
no
other
motive
for
this
action
than
her
infinite
love
and
the
reason
of
that
infinity
we
find
in
the
nature
of
that
love
it
is
in
fact
life
whereas
it
is
an
episode
in
the
life
of
man
of
course
we
are
not
here
speaking
of
transitory
inclinations
or
flirtations
but
of
that
great
and
profound
love
which
all
women
of
all
classes
know
and
this
love
is
overmastering
it
conquers
everything
it
forgives
everything
it
endures
everything
there
is
still
another
inexplicable
thing
eager
as
man
is
to
find
his
woman
virgin
woman
cares
little
about
the
similar
thing
in
man
only
the
very
young
pure
inexperienced
girl
feels
an
instinctive
revulsion
from
the
real
rou√©
but
other
women
according
to
rochebrune
love
a
man
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
other
women
who
love
or
have
loved
him
this
is
difficult
to
understand
but
it
is
a
fact
that
a
man
has
an
easy
task
with
women
if
he
has
a
reputation
of
being
a
great
hand
with
them
perhaps
this
ease
is
only
an
expression
of
the
conceit
and
envy
of
women
who
can
not
bear
the
idea
that
a
man
is
interested
in
so
many
others
and
not
in
themselves
as
balzac
says
prefer
most
to
win
a
man
who
already
belongs
to
the
inconceivable
ease
with
which
certain
types
of
men
seduce
women
and
at
whose
heads
women
throw
themselves
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
these
men
have
no
praiseworthy
qualities
whatever
can
only
be
so
explained
perhaps
it
is
true
as
is
sometimes
said
that
here
is
a
case
of
sexuality
expressing
itself
in
an
inexplicable
manner
of
course
there
are
friendships
between
men
and
women
although
such
friendships
are
very
rare
there
is
no
doubt
that
sexual
interests
tend
easily
to
dominate
such
relations
we
suppose
them
to
be
rare
just
because
their
existence
requires
that
sexual
motives
be
spontaneously
excluded
there
are
three
types
of
such
friendships
when
the
age
of
the
friends
is
such
as
to
make
the
suspicion
of
passion
impossible
when
from
earliest
childhood
for
one
reason
or
another
a
purely
fraternal
relationship
has
developed
when
both
are
of
such
nature
that
the
famous
divine
spark
can
not
set
them
afire
whether
there
is
an
electrical
influence
between
couples
as
some
scientists
say
or
not
we
frequently
see
two
people
irrationally
select
each
other
as
if
compelled
by
some
evil
force
now
this
selection
may
result
in
nothing
more
than
a
friendship
such
friendships
are
frequently
claimed
in
trials
and
of
course
they
are
never
altogether
believed
in
the
necessary
thing
in
treating
these
cases
is
caution
for
it
will
be
impossible
to
prove
these
friendships
unlikely
and
hence
unjust
to
deny
them
without
further
evidence
it
will
be
necessary
to
discover
whether
the
sexual
interest
is
or
can
be
excluded
if
not
the
friendship
is
purely
a
nominal
one
friendship
between
women
is
popularly
little
valued
comedies
comic
papers
and
criticisms
make
fun
of
it
and
we
have
heard
all
too
often
that
the
news
of
the
first
gray
hair
or
the
disloyalty
of
a
husband
has
its
in
a
woman
friend
and
that
women
decorate
themselves
and
improve
themselves
in
order
to
worry
their
friends
one
author
wanted
to
show
that
friendships
between
two
women
were
only
conspiracies
against
a
third
and
diderot
said
that
there
is
a
secret
union
among
women
as
among
priests
of
one
and
the
same
religion
they
hate
each
other
but
they
protect
each
other
the
latter
fact
we
see
frequently
enough
in
the
examination
of
women
witnesses
envy
dislike
jealousy
and
egoism
play
up
vividly
and
he
is
a
successful
judge
who
can
discover
how
much
of
the
evidence
is
born
of
these
motives
but
beyond
a
certain
point
women
this
point
is
easy
to
find
for
it
is
placed
feminine
qualities
are
to
be
generalized
so
long
as
we
stick
during
an
examination
to
a
concrete
instance
and
so
long
as
the
witness
observes
no
combination
of
her
conduct
and
opinions
with
that
of
the
object
of
her
testimony
she
will
allow
herself
to
be
guided
partly
by
the
truth
partly
by
her
opinions
of
the
woman
in
question
but
just
as
soon
as
we
expressly
or
tacitly
suggest
common
feminine
qualities
or
start
to
speak
of
some
matter
in
which
the
witness
herself
feels
guilty
she
turns
about
and
defends
where
before
she
had
been
attacking
in
these
cases
we
must
try
to
find
out
whether
we
have
become
if
we
have
we
know
why
the
witness
is
defending
the
accused
we
may
say
the
same
things
of
feminine
hate
that
we
have
said
of
feminine
love
love
and
hate
are
only
the
positive
and
negative
aspects
of
the
same
relation
when
a
woman
hates
you
she
has
loved
you
does
love
you
or
will
love
you
this
is
a
reliable
rule
for
the
many
cases
in
which
feminine
hatred
gives
the
criminalist
work
feminine
hatred
is
much
intenser
than
masculine
hatred
gregory
says
that
it
is
worse
than
the
for
the
devil
acts
alone
while
woman
gets
the
devil
to
help
her
and
stolle
believes
that
a
woman
seeking
revenge
is
capable
of
anything
we
have
here
to
remember
that
among
women
of
the
lower
classes
hate
anger
and
revenge
are
only
different
stages
of
the
same
emotion
moreover
nobody
finds
greater
joy
in
revenge
than
a
woman
indeed
i
might
say
that
revenge
and
the
pursuit
of
revenge
are
specifically
feminine
the
real
vigorous
man
is
not
easily
turned
thereto
in
woman
it
is
connected
with
her
greater
sensibility
which
causes
anger
rage
and
revenge
to
go
further
than
in
men
lombroso
has
done
most
to
show
this
and
mantegazza
cites
numberless
examples
of
the
superior
ease
with
which
woman
falls
into
paroxysms
of
rage
hence
when
some
crime
with
revenge
as
motive
is
before
us
and
we
have
no
way
of
getting
at
the
criminal
our
first
suspicion
should
be
directed
toward
a
woman
or
an
effeminate
man
further
when
we
have
to
make
an
orderly
series
of
inferences
we
will
start
from
this
proposition
into
the
past
present
and
future
and
shall
not
have
much
to
wonder
at
if
the
successful
vengeance
far
exceeds
its
actual
or
fanciful
occasion
and
if
perhaps
a
very
long
time
has
elapsed
before
its
accomplishment
nulla
irae
super
iram
mulieris
feminine
cruelty
is
directly
connected
with
feminine
anger
and
hatred
lombroso
has
already
indicated
how
fundamental
inclination
to
cruelty
is
the
cases
are
well
known
together
with
the
frequent
and
remarkable
combination
of
real
kindness
of
heart
with
real
bestiality
perhaps
it
would
be
proper
to
conceive
this
cruelty
as
a
form
of
defence
or
the
expression
of
defence
for
we
often
find
cruelty
and
weakness
paired
elsewhere
as
among
children
idiots
etc
it
is
particularly
noticeable
among
cretins
in
the
alps
the
great
danger
of
the
anger
is
well
known
there
once
one
of
these
unfortunates
was
tortured
to
death
by
another
because
he
thought
that
his
victim
had
received
from
the
charitable
monks
a
larger
piece
of
bread
than
he
another
was
killed
because
he
had
received
a
gift
of
two
trousers
buttons
these
instances
i
should
think
indicate
the
real
connection
between
cruelty
and
weakness
cruelty
is
a
means
of
defence
and
hence
is
characteristic
of
the
weaker
sex
moreover
many
a
curious
bit
of
feminine
cruelty
is
due
to
feminine
traits
misunderstood
suppressed
but
in
themselves
good
just
as
we
know
that
frugality
and
a
tendency
to
save
in
housekeeping
may
often
lead
to
dishonesty
so
we
perceive
that
these
qualities
cause
cruelty
to
servants
and
even
the
desire
to
put
out
of
the
way
old
and
troublesome
relatives
who
are
eating
the
bread
that
belongs
to
husband
and
children
these
facts
serve
not
only
to
explain
the
crime
but
to
reveal
the
criminal
if
we
succeed
other
things
being
equal
in
adducing
a
number
of
feminine
characteristics
with
one
of
which
the
cruelty
of
the
crime
may
be
connected
and
explained
we
have
a
clew
to
the
criminal
the
instances
mentioned
the
motherly
care
of
house
and
family
frugality
miserliness
hardness
to
servants
cruelty
to
aged
parents
seem
rare
and
not
altogether
rational
yet
they
occur
frequently
and
give
the
right
clew
to
the
criminal
there
are
still
other
similar
combinations
everybody
knows
feminine
love
for
trials
at
court
for
the
daily
reports
of
them
and
for
public
executions
while
the
last
were
still
common
in
austria
newspapers
concluded
regularly
with
the
statement
that
the
sex
was
the
great
majority
of
the
crowd
that
witnessed
them
at
public
executions
women
of
the
lower
class
at
great
trials
women
of
the
higher
classes
make
up
the
auditors
and
spectators
here
the
movement
from
eagerness
curiosity
through
the
desire
for
vigorous
nervous
stimulation
to
and
undeniable
cruelty
is
clear
enough
there
would
be
nothing
for
us
to
do
with
this
fact
if
we
had
not
to
deal
with
the
final
expression
of
cruelty
murder
especially
the
specifically
feminine
forms
of
murder
and
poisoning
these
of
course
in
particular
the
former
involve
abnormal
conditions
which
are
subjects
for
the
physician
at
the
same
time
it
is
the
judge
who
examines
and
sentences
and
he
is
required
to
understand
these
conditions
and
to
consider
every
detail
that
may
help
him
in
drawing
his
conclusion
that
poisoning
is
mainly
a
feminine
crime
is
a
familiar
fact
of
which
modern
writers
have
spoken
much
even
the
ancient
authors
not
medical
like
livy
tacitus
have
mentioned
it
it
is
necessary
therefore
carefully
to
study
the
feminine
character
in
order
to
understand
how
and
why
women
are
given
to
this
form
of
murder
to
do
so
we
need
consider
however
only
the
ordinary
factors
of
the
daily
life
the
extraordinary
conditions
are
generally
superfluous
every
crime
that
is
committed
is
committed
when
the
reasons
for
doing
it
outweigh
the
reasons
for
not
doing
it
this
is
true
even
of
passional
crimes
for
a
and
must
have
presented
themselves
in
spite
of
the
lightninglike
swiftness
of
the
act
one
appeared
and
then
the
other
the
won
and
the
deed
was
done
in
other
crimes
this
conflict
lasts
at
least
so
long
as
to
be
definitely
observable
and
in
the
greater
crimes
it
will
as
a
rule
take
more
time
and
more
motive
the
principles
of
good
and
of
evil
will
really
battle
with
each
other
and
when
the
individual
is
so
depraved
as
no
longer
to
have
good
principles
their
place
is
taken
by
fear
of
discovery
and
punishment
and
by
the
question
whether
the
advantage
to
be
gained
is
worth
the
effort
etc
the
commission
of
the
crime
is
itself
evidence
that
the
reasons
for
it
were
now
suppose
that
a
woman
gets
the
idea
of
killing
somebody
here
for
a
time
and
will
balance
each
other
and
when
the
latter
are
outweighed
she
will
think
that
she
commit
murder
if
she
does
not
think
so
she
will
not
do
so
now
every
murder
save
that
by
poison
requires
courage
the
power
to
do
and
physical
strength
as
woman
does
not
possess
these
qualities
she
spontaneously
makes
use
of
poison
hence
there
is
nothing
extraordinary
or
significant
in
this
fact
it
is
due
to
the
familiar
traits
of
woman
for
this
reason
when
there
is
any
doubt
as
to
the
murderer
in
a
case
of
poisoning
it
is
well
to
think
first
of
a
woman
or
of
a
weak
effeminate
man
the
weakness
of
woman
will
help
us
in
still
another
direction
it
is
easily
conceivable
that
all
forms
of
weakness
will
seek
support
and
assistance
whether
physical
or
moral
the
latter
is
inclined
in
cases
of
need
to
make
use
also
of
such
assistance
as
may
be
rendered
by
personal
inward
reflection
now
this
reflection
may
be
on
the
one
hand
dissuasion
on
the
other
hand
persuasion
the
first
subduing
the
latter
fear
of
discovery
hence
a
woman
will
try
to
persuade
not
only
herself
but
others
also
that
she
was
justified
in
her
course
and
will
assign
as
reason
bad
treatment
now
there
might
have
been
some
bad
treatment
but
it
will
have
been
altered
and
twisted
so
utterly
as
to
lose
its
original
form
and
to
become
imaginatively
unbearable
thus
a
series
of
conclusions
from
the
reactions
of
the
suspect
to
her
environment
may
be
easily
found
and
these
are
the
more
convincing
if
they
have
occurred
within
a
rather
long
period
of
time
in
which
they
may
be
chronologically
arranged
and
from
which
a
slow
and
definite
intensification
usque
ad
ultimum
can
be
proved
such
an
analysis
is
of
course
troublesome
but
if
done
systematically
almost
always
rich
in
results
the
tricks
of
persuasion
which
are
to
suppress
the
fears
of
discovery
are
always
helps
of
another
sort
as
a
rule
they
are
general
and
point
to
the
fact
that
the
crime
contemplated
had
occurred
before
without
danger
that
everything
was
intelligently
provided
for
etc
now
these
circumstances
are
less
dangerous
but
they
require
consideration
when
they
count
on
certain
popular
views
especially
superstitions
and
certain
customs
and
assumptions
suppose
for
example
that
a
young
wife
wants
to
get
rid
of
her
old
husband
whom
she
had
married
for
the
sake
of
his
money
now
certain
proverbs
point
to
the
fact
that
old
men
who
marry
young
women
die
soon
after
marriage
this
popular
view
may
be
entirely
justified
in
the
fact
that
the
complete
alteration
in
the
mode
of
life
the
experience
of
uncustomary
things
the
excitement
the
extreme
tension
then
the
effort
finally
perhaps
also
the
use
of
popularly
stimulants
may
easily
cause
weakening
sickening
and
as
conclusion
the
death
of
the
old
man
but
the
public
does
not
draw
this
kind
of
inference
it
simply
assumes
without
asking
the
reason
that
when
an
old
man
marries
a
young
woman
he
dies
therefore
a
young
wife
may
easily
think
i
make
use
of
poison
nobody
will
wonder
nobody
will
see
anything
suspicious
about
the
death
it
is
only
an
event
which
is
universally
supposed
to
happen
the
old
man
died
because
he
married
such
ideas
may
easily
seduce
an
uneducated
woman
and
determine
her
conduct
of
course
they
are
not
subject
to
observation
but
they
are
not
beyond
control
if
the
popular
views
concerning
certain
matters
are
known
as
the
views
which
determine
standards
therefore
their
introduction
into
the
plot
of
the
suspect
may
help
us
in
drawing
some
useful
inference
with
regard
to
the
consideration
of
psychopathic
conditions
need
not
absolutely
be
undertaken
whether
they
are
present
must
of
course
be
determined
and
therefore
it
is
first
of
all
necessary
to
learn
the
character
of
the
conduct
the
opportunity
for
this
is
given
in
any
on
legal
medicine
forensic
psychopathology
and
criminal
psychology
there
are
a
good
many
older
authors
most
of
the
cases
cited
by
authorities
show
that
women
in
the
best
of
circumstances
have
behaved
innumerable
times
in
such
a
way
that
if
they
had
been
poor
girls
would
immediately
have
been
assumed
again
they
have
shown
that
the
sweetest
and
most
harmless
creatures
become
real
beasts
at
the
time
of
accouchement
or
shortly
after
it
develop
an
unbelievable
hatred
toward
child
and
husband
many
a
may
possibly
be
explained
by
the
habit
of
some
animals
of
consuming
their
young
immediately
after
giving
birth
to
them
such
cases
bind
us
in
every
trial
for
to
have
the
mental
state
of
the
mother
thoroughly
examined
by
a
psychiatrist
and
to
interpret
everything
connected
with
the
matter
as
psychologist
and
humanitarian
at
the
same
time
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
one
of
the
most
dangerous
results
is
due
to
this
attitude
have
without
further
consideration
kept
in
mind
the
mental
condition
of
the
mother
and
have
made
much
less
punishable
than
ordinary
murder
it
is
inferred
therefore
that
it
is
unnecessary
to
study
the
conditions
which
cause
it
this
is
dangerous
because
it
implies
the
belief
that
the
case
is
settled
by
giving
a
minimum
sentence
where
really
an
infinity
of
grades
and
differences
may
enter
the
situation
that
the
has
studied
is
one
among
many
the
majority
of
which
we
have
yet
to
apprehend
and
to
examine

madame
de
kr√ºdener
writes
in
a
letter
to
bernardin
de
pierre
voulais
√™tre
these
laconic
words
of
this
wise
pietist
give
us
an
insight
into
the
significance
of
emotional
life
of
woman
man
wants
to
be
understood
woman
felt
with
this
emotion
she
spoils
much
that
man
might
do
because
of
his
sense
of
justice
indeed
a
number
of
qualities
which
the
woman
uses
to
make
herself
noted
are
bound
up
with
her
emotional
life
more
or
less
compassion
religion
superstition
all
these
depend
on
the
highly
developed
almost
diseased
formation
of
her
emotional
life
feminine
charity
feminine
activity
as
a
nurse
feminine
petitions
for
the
pardon
of
criminals
infinite
other
samples
of
kindly
dispositions
must
convince
us
that
these
activities
are
an
integral
part
of
their
emotional
life
and
that
women
perform
them
only
perhaps
in
a
kind
of
dark
perception
of
their
own
helplessness
on
the
one
side
an
unconscious
egoism
impels
them
to
the
defence
of
those
who
find
themselves
in
a
condition
on
the
other
side
it
is
a
feminine
characteristic
to
apply
anything
she
is
to
judge
to
herself
first
and
then
to
make
her
choice
that
she
does
this
rests
on
the
eminent
overweight
of
emotion
so
schopenhauer
says
are
very
sympathetic
but
they
are
behind
man
in
all
matters
of
justice
probity
and
scrupulous
conscientiousness
injustice
is
the
fundamental
feminine
schopenhauer
should
have
added
they
are
too
sympathetic
because
emotion
takes
up
so
much
place
in
their
minds
that
they
have
not
enough
left
for
according
to
proudhon
conscience
of
woman
is
as
much
weaker
than
as
her
intelligence
is
smaller
her
morality
is
of
a
different
sort
her
ideas
of
right
and
wrong
are
different
being
always
on
this
or
that
side
of
justice
and
never
requiring
any
equivalence
between
rights
and
duties
which
are
such
a
painful
necessity
to
spencer
says
briefly
that
the
feminine
mind
shows
a
definite
lack
with
regard
to
the
sense
of
justice
these
assertions
show
that
women
are
deficient
in
justice
but
do
not
show
why
the
deficiency
is
to
be
explained
only
in
the
superabundance
of
emotional
life
this
superabundance
clarifies
a
number
of
facts
of
their
daily
routine
we
have
of
course
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
feeling
of
a
gentlewoman
of
a
peasant
woman
and
of
the
innumerable
grades
between
the
two
but
this
distinction
is
not
essential
both
noble
and
proletarian
are
equally
unjust
but
the
rich
emotion
restores
a
thousand
times
what
may
be
missing
in
justice
and
perhaps
in
many
cases
hits
better
upon
what
is
absolutely
right
than
the
bare
masculine
sense
of
justice
we
are
of
course
frequently
mistaken
by
relying
on
the
testimony
of
women
but
only
when
we
assume
that
our
rigorously
judicial
sentence
is
the
only
correct
one
and
when
we
do
not
know
how
women
judge
hence
we
interpret
testimonies
with
difficulty
and
rarely
with
correctness
we
forget
that
almost
every
feminine
statement
contains
in
itself
much
more
judgment
than
the
testimony
of
men
we
fail
to
examine
how
much
real
judgment
it
contains
and
finally
we
weigh
this
judgment
in
other
scales
than
those
used
by
the
woman
we
do
best
therefore
when
we
take
the
testimony
of
man
and
woman
together
in
order
to
find
the
right
average
this
is
not
easy
for
we
are
unable
to
enter
properly
into
the
emotional
life
of
woman
and
can
not
therefore
discount
that
tendency
of
hers
to
drag
the
objective
truth
in
some
biased
direction
it
might
be
theoretically
supposed
that
a
noble
kindly
feminine
feeling
would
tend
to
reflect
everything
as
better
and
gentler
and
would
tend
to
excuse
and
conceal
if
that
were
so
we
might
have
a
definite
standard
of
valuation
and
might
be
able
to
discount
the
feminine
bias
but
that
is
so
in
perhaps
no
more
than
half
the
cases
that
come
before
us
in
all
others
woman
has
allowed
herself
to
be
moved
to
displeasure
and
appears
as
the
punishing
avenger
hence
she
fights
with
all
her
strength
on
the
side
that
seems
to
her
to
be
oppressed
and
innocently
persecuted
irrespective
of
whether
it
is
the
side
of
the
accused
or
of
his
enemy
in
consequence
we
must
first
of
all
when
judging
her
statements
determine
the
direction
in
which
her
emotion
impels
her
and
this
can
not
be
done
with
a
mere
knowledge
of
human
nature
nothing
will
do
except
a
careful
study
of
the
specific
feminine
witness
at
the
time
she
gives
her
evidence
and
this
requires
the
expenditure
of
much
time
for
to
plunge
directly
into
the
middle
of
things
without
having
any
means
of
comparison
or
relation
is
to
make
judgment
impossible
or
very
unsafe
if
you
are
to
do
it
at
all
you
must
discuss
other
things
first
and
even
permit
yourself
the
dishonesty
of
asking
about
matters
which
you
already
know
in
order
to
find
some
measure
of
the
degree
of
feminine
obliqueness
of
course
one
discovers
here
only
the
degree
of
obliqueness
not
its
direction
in
the
case
selected
for
comparison
the
woman
might
have
judged
too
kindly
in
the
case
in
hand
she
may
just
as
well
be
too
rigorous
but
all
things
have
a
definite
limit
and
hence
much
practice
and
much
goodwill
will
help
us
to
discover
the
direction
of
obliqueness
when
we
inquire
into
the
emotional
life
of
the
simple
uneducated
women
we
find
it
to
be
fundamentally
the
same
as
that
of
women
of
other
classes
but
different
in
expression
and
it
is
the
expression
we
have
to
observe
its
form
is
often
raw
therefore
difficult
to
discover
it
may
express
itself
in
cursing
and
swearing
but
it
is
still
an
expression
of
emotion
just
as
are
the
curses
or
beatings
of
her
child
because
it
has
fallen
and
hurt
itself
but
observe
that
the
prevalence
of
emotion
is
so
thoroughly
a
feminine
condition
that
it
is
clearly
noticeable
only
where
femininity
itself
is
explicit
therefore
always
weaker
among
masculine
women
and
in
the
single
individual
most
powerful
when
femininity
is
most
fully
developed
it
grows
in
the
child
remains
at
a
constant
level
when
woman
becomes
completely
woman
and
decreases
when
in
advanced
age
the
differences
in
sex
begin
to
disappear
very
old
men
and
very
old
women
are
also
in
this
matter
very
close
together

weakness
thy

says
shakespeare
and

this
in
teasing
fashion

day

even
kant
takes
feminine
weakness
as
a
distinguishing
criterion
order
to
understand
the
whole
of
mankind
we
need
only
to
turn
our
attention
to
the
feminine
sex
for
where
the
force
is
weaker
the
tool
is
so
much
the
more
experienced
criminalists
explain
the
fact
that
women
are
the
chief
sources
of
anonymous
letters
by
their
weakness
from
the
physical
inferiority
of
woman
her
mental
inferiority
may
be
deduced
and
though
we
learn
a
hundred
times
that
small
weak
men
can
be
mentally
stronger
than
great
and
strong
ones
it
is
of
course
natural
that
as
a
rule
the
outcome
of
a
powerful
body
is
also
a
powerful
mind
the
difficulty
is
to
discover
in
feminine
weakness
expresses
itself
the
frequently
of
men
has
been
explained
by
voltaire
as
the
fulfilment
of
the
divine
purpose
of
taming
men
through
the
medium
of
the
specially
created
instrument
woman
victor
hugo
calls
men
only
toys
this
lofty
providence
which
gives
each
one
its
toy
the
doll
to
the
child
the
child
to
the
man
the
man
to
the
woman
the
woman
to
the
the
popular
proverb
also
seems
to
assign
them
considerable
strength
at
least
to
aged
women
for
we
hear
in
all
kinds
of
variations
the
expression
old
woman
will
venture
where
the
devil
does
not
dare
to
nor
must
we
underestimate
the
daily
experience
of
feminine
capacity
to
bear
pain
midwives
of
experience
unanimously
assure
us
that
no
man
would
bear
what
a
woman
regularly
has
to
every
time
she
gives
birth
to
a
child
and
surgeons
and
dentists
assure
us
similarly
indeed
the
great
surgeon
billroth
is
said
to
have
asserted
that
he
attempted
new
methods
of
operation
on
women
first
because
they
are
less
subject
to
pain
for
like
savages
they
are
beings
of
a
lower
status
and
hence
better
able
to
resist
than
men
in
the
light
of
such
expressions
we
have
to
doubt
the
assertion
that
women
are
distinguished
by
weakness
and
yet
that
assertion
is
correct
the
weakness
must
however
not
be
sought
where
we
expect
to
find
it
but
in
the
quite
different
feminine
intelligence
wherever
intelligence
is
not
taken
into
consideration
woman
is
likely
to
show
herself
stronger
than
man
she
is
better
able
to
stand
misfortune
to
nurse
patients
to
bear
pain
to
bring
up
children
to
carry
out
a
plan
to
persevere
in
a
plan
it
would
be
wrong
to
say
that
feminine
weakness
is
a
weakness
of
will
for
most
examples
show
that
wills
are
strong
it
is
in
matters
of
intelligence
that
they
fail
when
somebody
has
to
be
persuaded
we
find
that
a
man
may
agree
when
he
is
shown
a
series
of
reasons
but
the
feminine
intelligence
is
incapable
of
logic
indeed
we
should
make
a
mistake
in
paying
honor
to
the
actual
feminine
in
woman
if
she
were
capable
of
logic
she
is
rather
to
be
persuaded
with
apparent
reasons
with
transitory
and
sparkling
matters
that
have
only
the
semblance
of
truth
we
find
her
too
ready
to
agree
and
blame
her
will
when
it
is
only
her
different
form
of
intelligence
she
persuades
herself
in
the
same
way
an
epithet
a
sparkling
epigram
a
pacifying
reflection
is
enough
for
her
she
does
not
need
a
whole
construction
of
reason
and
thus
she
proceeds
to
do
things
that
we
again
call
take
so
thoroughly
a
feminine
reflection
as
this
heart
seems
to
beat
why
it
beat
for
somebody
and
the
woman
throws
herself
on
the
breast
of
some
adventurer
the
world
that
hears
of
this
fact
weeps
over
feminine
while
it
ought
really
to
weep
over
defective
intelligence
and
bad
logic
that
the
physiological
throb
of
the
heart
need
not
become
significant
of
love
that
the
owner
of
a
beating
heart
need
not
be
interested
in
some
man
and
certainly
not
in
that
particular
adventurer
she
does
not
even
consider
possible
she
is
satisfied
with
this
sparkling
syllogism
and
her
understanding
is
calm
the
judge
in
the
criminal
court
must
always
first
consider
the
weakness
of
the
feminine
intelligence
not
of
the
feminine
will
it
is
supposed
to
be
weakness
of
will
which
makes
woman
gossipy
unable
to
keep
a
secret
but
here
again
it
is
her
understanding
that
is
at
fault
this
is
shown
by
the
fact
already
thoroughly
discussed
by
kant
that
women
are
good
keepers
of
their
own
secrets
but
never
of
the
secrets
of
others
if
this
were
not
a
defect
of
intelligence
they
would
have
been
able
to
estimate
the
damage
they
do
now
every
one
of
us
criminalists
knows
that
the
crime
committed
and
even
the
plan
for
it
has
in
most
cases
been
betrayed
by
women
we
can
learn
most
about
this
matter
from
detectives
who
always
go
to
women
for
the
discovery
of
facts
and
rarely
without
success
of
course
the
judge
must
not
act
like
a
detective
but
he
must
know
when
something
is
already
a
matter
of
discussion
and
its
source
is
sought
where
to
look
he
is
to
look
for
the
woman
in
the
case
another
consideration
of
importance
is
the
fact
that
women
who
have
told
secrets
have
also
altered
them
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
because
they
are
secrets
the
whole
is
not
told
them
and
they
have
had
to
infer
much
or
they
have
not
properly
understood
what
was
told
now
if
we
perceive
that
only
a
part
of
the
revealed
secret
can
be
correct
the
situation
may
be
inferred
with
complete
safety
but
only
by
remembering
this
curious
trait
of
feminine
intelligence
we
have
only
to
ask
what
illogical
elements
does
the
matter
contain
when
these
are
discovered
we
have
to
ask
what
is
their
logical
form
if
the
process
is
followed
properly
we
get
at
the
truth
that
what
happens
happens
logically
but
what
is
thought
is
thought
illogically
even
by
women
when
we
summarise
all
we
know
about
woman
we
may
say
briefly
woman
is
neither
better
nor
worse
neither
more
nor
less
valuable
than
man
but
she
is
different
from
him
and
inasmuch
as
nature
has
created
every
object
correctly
for
its
purpose
woman
has
also
been
so
created
the
reason
of
her
existence
is
different
from
that
of
and
hence
her
nature
is
different
section
b
children
the
special
character
of
the
child
has
to
be
kept
in
mind
both
when
it
appears
as
witness
and
as
accused
to
treat
it
like
an
adult
is
always
wrong
it
would
be
wrong
moreover
to
seek
the
differences
in
its
immaturity
and
inexperience
in
its
small
knowledge
and
narrower
outlook
this
is
only
a
part
of
the
difference
the
fact
is
that
because
the
child
is
in
the
process
of
growth
and
development
of
its
organs
because
the
relations
of
these
to
each
other
are
different
and
their
functions
are
different
it
is
actually
a
different
kind
of
being
from
the
adult
when
we
think
how
different
the
body
and
actions
of
the
child
are
how
different
its
nourishment
how
differently
foreign
influences
affect
it
and
how
different
its
physical
qualities
are
we
must
see
that
its
mental
character
is
also
completely
different
hence
a
difference
in
degree
tells
us
nothing
we
must
look
for
a
difference
in
kind
observations
made
by
individuals
are
not
enough
we
must
undertake
especial
studies
in
the
very
rich
literature
section
one
does
not
need
to
have
much
knowledge
of
children
to
know
that
as
a
rule
children
are
more
honest
and
straightforward
than
adults
they
are
good
observers
more
disinterested
and
hence
unbiased
in
giving
evidence
but
because
of
their
weakness
more
subject
to
the
influence
of
other
people
apart
from
intentional
influences
there
is
the
tremendous
influence
of
selected
preconceptions
if
a
child
is
an
important
witness
we
can
never
get
the
truth
from
him
until
we
discover
what
his
ideals
are
it
is
of
course
true
that
everybody
who
has
ideals
is
influenced
by
them
but
it
is
also
true
that
children
who
have
adventurous
imaginative
tendencies
are
so
steeped
in
them
that
everything
they
think
or
do
gets
color
tone
and
significance
from
them
what
the
object
of
adventure
does
is
good
what
it
does
not
do
is
bad
what
it
possesses
is
beautiful
and
what
it
asserts
is
correct
numerous
unexplainable
assertions
and
actions
of
children
are
cleared
up
by
reference
to
their
particular
ideals
if
they
may
be
called
ideals
as
a
rule
we
may
hold
that
children
have
a
certain
sense
of
justice
and
that
they
find
it
decidedly
unpleasant
to
see
anybody
treated
otherwise
than
he
deserves
but
in
this
connection
it
must
be
considered
that
the
child
has
its
own
views
as
to
what
a
deserts
are
and
that
these
views
can
rarely
be
judged
by
our
own
in
the
same
way
it
is
certain
that
lacking
things
to
think
or
to
trouble
about
children
are
much
interested
in
and
remember
well
what
occurs
about
them
but
again
we
have
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
interest
itself
develops
from
the
standpoint
and
that
his
memory
constructs
new
events
in
terms
of
his
earlier
experiences
as
a
rule
we
may
presuppose
in
his
memory
only
what
is
found
already
in
his
occupations
what
is
new
altogether
new
must
first
find
a
function
and
that
is
difficult
if
now
a
child
remembers
something
he
will
first
try
to
fit
it
to
some
function
of
memory
already
present
and
this
will
then
absorb
the
new
fact
well
or
ill
as
the
case
may
be
the
frequent
oversight
of
this
fact
is
the
reason
for
many
a
false
interpretation
of
what
the
child
said
he
is
believed
to
have
perceived
falsely
and
to
have
made
false
restatements
when
he
has
only
perceived
and
restated
in
his
own
way
as
children
have
rarely
a
proper
sense
of
the
value
of
life
they
observe
an
undubitable
death
closely
without
much
fear
this
explains
many
an
unbelievable
act
of
courage
or
clear
observation
in
a
child
in
cases
where
an
adult
frightened
can
see
nothing
it
is
hence
unjust
to
doubt
many
a
statement
of
children
because
you
doubt
their
was
not
in
question
at
all
concerning
the
difference
between
boys
and
girls
l√∂bisch
says
rightly
that
girls
remember
persons
better
and
boys
things
he
adds
moreover
more
silent
girl
who
is
given
to
observe
what
is
before
her
shows
herself
more
teachable
than
the
spiteful
and
also
more
imaginative
boy
who
understands
with
difficulty
because
he
is
intended
to
be
better
grounded
and
to
go
further
in
the
business
of
knowing
the
girl
all
in
all
is
more
curious
the
boy
more
eager
to
know
what
he
fails
in
what
he
is
not
spurred
to
by
love
or
talent
he
throws
obstinately
aside
while
the
girl
loyally
and
trustfully
absorbs
her
teachings
the
boy
remains
unsatisfied
without
some
insight
into
the
or
without
some
proof
the
boy
enters
daily
more
and
more
into
the
world
of
concepts
while
the
girl
thinks
of
objects
not
as
members
of
a
class
but
as
definite
particular
section
as
once
in
an
examination
of
the
value
of
the
testimony
of
children
i
found
it
to
be
excellent
in
certain
directions
because
not
so
much
influenced
by
passion
and
special
interest
as
that
of
adults
and
because
we
may
assume
that
children
have
classified
too
little
rather
than
too
much
that
they
frequently
do
not
understand
an
event
but
perceive
instinctively
that
it
means
disorder
and
hence
become
interested
in
it
later
the
child
gets
a
broader
horizon
and
understands
what
he
has
not
formerly
understood
although
possibly
not
altogether
with
correctness
i
have
further
found
that
the
boy
just
growing
out
of
childhood
in
so
far
as
he
has
been
well
brought
up
is
especially
the
best
observer
and
witness
there
is
he
observes
everything
that
occurs
with
interest
synthesizes
events
without
prejudice
and
reproduces
them
accurately
while
the
girl
of
the
same
age
is
often
an
unreliable
even
dangerous
witness
this
is
almost
always
the
case
when
the
girl
is
in
some
degree
talented
impulsive
dreamy
romantic
and
adventurous
she
expresses
a
sort
of
weltschmerz
connected
with
ennui
this
comes
early
and
if
a
girl
of
that
age
is
herself
drawn
into
the
circle
of
the
events
in
question
we
are
never
safe
from
extreme
exaggeration
the
merest
larceny
becomes
a
small
robbery
a
bare
insult
a
remarkable
attack
a
foolish
quip
an
interesting
seduction
and
a
stupid
boyish
conversation
an
important
conspiracy
such
causes
of
mistakes
are
to
all
judges
at
the
same
time
they
are
again
and
again
permitted
to
recur
the
sole
means
of
safety
from
them
is
the
clearest
comprehension
possible
of
the
mental
horizon
of
the
child
in
question
we
have
very
little
general
knowledge
about
it
and
hence
are
much
indebted
to
the
contemporary
attempts
of
teachers
to
supply
the
information
we
all
know
that
we
must
make
distinctions
between
city
and
country
children
and
must
not
be
surprised
at
the
country
child
who
has
not
seen
a
a
railroad
or
something
similar
stanley
hall
tried
to
discover
from
six
year
old
children
whether
they
really
knew
the
things
the
names
of
which
they
used
freely
it
seemed
as
a
result
that
of
them
had
never
seen
a
star
had
never
been
in
the
country
did
not
know
that
milk
came
from
a
cow
that
comes
from
trees
to
the
difference
between
green
blue
and
yellow
and
had
never
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
pig
karl
lange
made
experiments
reported
in
apperzeption
plauen
on
pupils
in
schools
in
small
towns
the
experiment
showed
that
had
never
seen
a
sunset
a
corn
field
a
river
a
pond
a
lock
had
never
been
in
the
woods
never
on
the
mountains
and
did
not
know
how
bread
was
made
from
grain
involuntarily
the
question
arises
what
must
be
the
position
of
the
unfortunate
children
of
large
cities
and
moreover
what
may
we
expect
to
hear
from
children
who
do
not
know
things
like
that
and
at
the
same
time
speak
of
them
easily
adults
are
not
free
from
this
difficulty
either
we
have
never
yet
seen
a
living
whale
or
a
sandstorm
in
the
sahara
or
an
ancient
teuton
yet
we
speak
of
them
confidently
and
profoundly
and
never
secure
ourselves
against
the
fact
that
we
have
never
seen
them
now
as
we
of
the
ancient
teuton
so
children
of
the
woods
neither
have
seen
them
but
one
description
has
as
much
or
as
little
value
as
the
other
concerning
the
integration
of
senses
binet
and
henri
have
examined
children
whom
they
had
imitate
the
length
of
a
model
line
or
pick
out
from
a
collection
of
lines
those
of
similar
length
the
latter
experiment
was
extraordinarily
successful
the
senses
of
children
are
especially
keen
and
properly
developed
it
is
anatomically
true
that
very
young
children
do
not
hear
well
but
that
is
so
at
an
age
which
can
not
be
of
interest
to
us
their
sense
of
smell
is
according
to
heusinger
very
dull
and
develops
at
the
time
of
puberty
but
later
observers
in
particular
those
who
like
hack
cloquet
and
others
have
studied
the
sense
of
smell
say
nothing
about
this
concerning
the
accuracy
of
representation
in
children
authorities
are
contradictory
montaigne
says
that
all
children
lie
and
are
obstinate
bourdin
corroborates
him
maudsley
says
that
children
often
have
illusions
which
seem
to
them
indubitably
real
images
and
mittermaier
says
that
they
are
superficial
and
have
youthful
fancies
experience
in
practice
does
not
confirm
this
judgment
the
much
experienced
herder
repeatedly
prizes
children
as
born
physiognomists
and
soden
values
the
disinterestedness
of
children
very
highly
according
to
l√∂bisch
children
tell
untruths
without
lying
they
say
only
what
they
have
in
mind
but
they
do
not
know
and
care
very
little
whether
their
mental
content
is
objective
and
exists
outside
of
them
or
whether
only
half
real
and
the
rest
fanciful
this
is
confirmed
by
legal
experience
which
shows
us
also
that
the
subjective
half
of
a
story
may
be
easily
identified
it
is
characteristically
different
from
the
real
event
and
a
confusion
of
the
two
is
impossible
we
must
also
not
forget
that
there
are
lacunae
in
the
comprehension
of
what
it
perceives
when
it
observes
an
event
it
may
completely
understand
the
first
part
find
the
second
part
altogether
new
and
unintelligible
the
third
part
again
comprehensible
etc
if
the
child
is
only
it
will
try
to
fill
out
these
lacunae
by
reflection
and
synthesis
and
may
conceivably
make
serious
blunders
the
blunders
and
inaccuracies
increase
the
further
back
the
event
goes
into
the
youth
the
real
capacity
for
memory
goes
far
back
preyer
tells
of
cases
in
which
children
told
of
events
that
they
had
experienced
at
and
even
eighteen
months
and
told
them
correctly
of
course
adults
do
not
recall
experiences
of
such
an
early
age
for
they
have
long
since
forgotten
them
but
very
small
children
can
recall
such
experiences
though
in
most
cases
their
recollection
is
worthless
their
circle
of
ideas
being
so
small
that
the
commonest
experiences
are
excluded
from
adequate
description
but
they
are
worth
while
considering
when
a
mere
fact
is
in
question
or
is
to
be
doubted
were
you
beaten
was
anybody
there
where
did
the
man
stand
determinations
of
time
are
unreliable
yesterday
and
are
easily
confused
by
small
children
and
a
considerably
advanced
intelligence
is
necessary
to
distinguish
between
yesterday
and
a
week
ago
or
even
a
week
and
a
month
that
we
need
in
such
cases
correct
individualization
of
the
witness
is
the
conditions
of
the
the
things
he
learned
to
know
are
what
we
must
first
of
all
learn
if
the
question
in
hand
can
fit
into
the
notion
the
child
possesses
he
will
answer
better
and
more
if
quite
unendowed
than
if
a
very
clever
child
who
is
foreign
to
the
notions
of
the
defined
situation
i
should
take
intelligence
only
to
be
of
next
importance
in
such
cases
and
advise
giving
up
separating
clever
from
stupid
children
in
favor
of
separating
practical
and
unpractical
children
the
latter
makes
an
essential
difference
both
the
children
of
talent
and
stupid
children
may
be
practical
or
unpractical
if
a
child
is
talented
and
practical
he
will
become
a
useful
member
of
society
who
will
be
at
home
everywhere
and
will
be
able
to
help
himself
under
any
circumstances
if
a
child
is
talented
and
unpractical
it
may
grow
up
into
a
professor
as
is
customarily
expected
of
it
if
a
child
is
untalented
and
practical
it
will
properly
fill
a
definite
place
and
if
it
has
luck
and
may
even
attain
high
station
in
life
if
it
is
untalented
and
unpractical
it
becomes
one
of
those
poor
creatures
who
never
get
anywhere
for
the
r√¥le
of
witness
the
practicality
is
the
important
thing
the
practical
child
will
see
observe
properly
understand
and
reproduce
a
group
of
things
that
the
unpractical
child
has
not
even
observed
of
course
it
is
well
also
to
have
the
child
talented
but
i
repeat
the
least
clever
practical
child
is
worth
more
as
witness
than
the
most
clever
unpractical
child
what
the
term
stands
for
is
difficult
to
say
but
everybody
knows
it
and
everybody
has
seen
who
has
cared
about
children
at
all
that
there
are
practical
children
section
there
have
never
lacked
authors
who
have
assigned
to
children
a
great
group
of
defects
ever
since
lombroso
it
has
been
the
custom
in
a
certain
circle
to
find
the
worst
crimes
already
foreshadowed
in
children
if
there
are
congenital
criminals
it
must
follow
that
there
are
criminals
among
children
it
is
shown
that
the
most
cruel
and
most
unhuman
men
like
nero
caracalla
caligula
louis
xi
charles
ix
louis

showed
signs
of

cruelty

broussais
says
is
hardly
a
lad
who
will
not
intentionally
abuse
weaker
boys
this
is
his
first
impulse
his
cries
of
pain
restrain
him
for
a
moment
from
further
maltreatment
if
the
love
of
bullying
is
not
native
with
him
but
at
the
first
offered
opportunity
he
again
follows
his
instinctive
even
the
power
of
training
is
reduced
and
is
expressed
in
the
proverb
that
children
and
nations
take
note
only
of
their
last
beating
the
time
about
and
especially
just
before
the
development
of
puberty
seems
to
be
an
especially
bad
one
and
according
to
voisin
and
friedreich
modern
man
sees
in
this
beginning
of
masculinity
the
cause
of
the
most
extraordinary
and
doubtful
impulses
since
esquirol
invented
the
doctrine
of
monomanias
there
has
grown
up
a
whole
literature
especially
concerning
pyromania
among
girls
who
are
just
becoming
marriageable
and
friedreich
even
asserts
that
all
pubescent
children
suffer
from
pyromania
while
grohmann
holds
that
scrofulous
children
are
in
the
habit
of
stealing
when
this
literature
is
tested
the
conclusion
is
inevitable
that
there
has
been
overbold
generalization
one
may
easily
see
how
of
course
there
are
badly
behaved
children
and
it
is
no
agreement
with
the
italian
positivists
to
add
also
that
a
large
number
of
criminals
were
good
for
nothing
even
in
their
earliest
youth
but
we
are
here
concerned
with
the
specific
endowment
of
childhood
and
it
is
certainly
an
exaggeration
to
set
this
lower
than
that
of
maturity
if
it
be
asked
what
influence
nurture
and
training
have
if
children
are
good
without
it
we
may
answer
at
once
that
these
have
done
enough
in
having
supplied
a
counterbalance
to
the
depraving
influences
of
life
the
awakening
passions
and
the
environment
children
who
are
bad
at
an
early
age
are
easily
noticeable
they
make
noise
and
trouble
as
thousands
of
children
do
not
and
a
poor
few
of
such
bad
ones
are
taken
to
be
representative
of
all
what
is
silent
and
not
significant
goes
of
itself
makes
no
impression
even
though
it
is
incomparably
of
greater
magnitude
individual
and
noisy
cases
require
so
much
attention
that
their
character
is
assigned
to
the
whole
class
dreams
forewarnings
and
prophecies
are
similarly
treated
if
they
do
not
succeed
they
are
forgotten
but
if
in
one
case
they
succeed
they
make
a
great
noise
they
appear
therefore
to
seduce
the
mind
into
incorrectly
interpreting
them
as
typical
and
generally
there
is
a
tendency
to
make
sweeping
statements
about
children
you
have
understood
this
you
understand
that
also
children
are
often
told
and
most
of
the
time
unjustly
the
child
is
treated
like
a
grown
man
to
whom
has
occurred
as
often
as
and
who
has
intelligence
enough
and
experience
enough
to
apply
to
by
way
of
identification
consider
an
exaggerated
example
the
child
let
us
say
knows
very
well
that
stealing
is
dishonorable
sinful
criminal
but
it
does
not
know
that
counterfeiting
treachery
and
arson
are
forbidden
these
differences
however
may
be
reduced
to
a
hair
it
knows
that
stealing
is
forbidden
but
considers
it
permissible
to
the
fruit
it
knows
that
lying
is
a
sin
but
it
does
not
know
that
certain
lies
become
suddenly
punishable
according
to
law
and
are
called
frauds
when
therefore
a
boy
tells
his
uncle
that
father
sent
him
for
money
because
he
does
not
happen
to
have
any
at
home
and
when
the
little
rascal
spends
the
money
for
sweets
he
may
perhaps
believe
that
the
lie
is
quite
ugly
but
that
he
had
done
anything
objectively
punishable
he
may
be
totally
unaware
it
is
just
as
difficult
for
the
child
to
become
subjective
the
child
is
more
of
an
egoist
than
the
adult
on
the
one
hand
because
it
is
protected
and
watched
in
many
directions
by
the
adult
on
the
other
because
from
the
nature
of
things
it
does
not
have
to
care
for
anybody
and
would
go
if
it
were
not
itself
cared
for
the
natural
consequences
are
that
it
does
not
discover
the
limits
between
what
is
permissible
and
what
is
not
permissible
as
kraus
says
youth
shows
a
distinct
quality
in
distinguishing
good
and
evil
a
child
of
this
age
that
is
required
to
judge
the
action
or
relations
of
persons
will
not
keep
one
waiting
for
the
proper
solution
but
if
the
action
is
brought
into
relation
to
its
selfhood
to
its
own
personality
there
is
a
sudden
disingenuity
a
twisting
of
the
judgment
an
incapacity
in
the
child
to
set
itself
at
the
objective
point
of
hence
it
is
wrong
to
ask
a
child
you
know
that
you
should
not
have
done
this
thing
the
child
will
answer
i
knew
but
it
does
not
dare
to
add
knew
that
other
people
ought
not
do
it
but
i
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
spoiled
pampered
pet
should
say
this
any
child
has
this
prejudiced
attitude
and
how
shall
it
know
the
limit
between
what
is
permitted
it
and
what
is
not
adults
must
work
the
child
plays
the
mother
must
cook
the
child
comes
to
the
laden
table
the
mother
must
wash
the
child
wears
the
clean
clothes
it
gets
the
titbits
it
is
protected
against
cold
it
is
forgiven
many
a
deed
and
many
a
word
not
permitted
the
adult
now
all
of
a
sudden
it
is
blamed
because
it
has
gone
on
making
use
of
its
recognized
privileges
whoever
remembers
this
artificial
but
nevertheless
necessary
egoism
in
children
will
have
to
think
more
kindly
of
many
a
childish
crime
moreover
we
must
not
overlook
the
fact
that
the
child
does
many
things
simply
as
blind
imitation
more
accurate
observation
of
this
well
known
psychological
fact
will
show
how
extensive
childish
imitation
is
at
a
certain
limit
of
course
liability
is
here
also
present
but
if
a
child
is
imitating
an
imitable
person
a
parent
a
teacher
its
responsibility
is
at
an
end
all
in
all
we
may
say
that
nobody
has
brought
any
evidence
to
show
that
children
are
any
than
adults
experience
teaches
that
hypocrisy
calculating
evil
intentional
selfishness
and
purposeful
lying
are
incomparably
rarer
among
children
than
among
adults
and
that
on
the
whole
they
observe
well
and
willingly
we
may
take
children
with
the
exception
of
pubescent
girls
to
be
good
reliable
witnesses
section
c
senility
it
would
seem
that
we
lawyers
have
taken
insufficient
account
of
the
characteristics
of
senility
these
characteristics
are
as
definitive
as
those
of
childhood
or
of
sex
and
to
overlook
them
may
lead
to
serious
consequences
we
shall
not
consider
that
degree
of
old
age
which
is
called
second
childhood
at
that
stage
the
question
seriously
arises
whether
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
idiocy
of
age
or
at
least
with
a
weakness
of
perception
and
of
memory
so
obvious
that
they
can
not
be
mistaken
the
important
stage
is
the
one
which
precedes
this
and
in
which
a
definite
decline
in
mental
power
is
not
yet
perceivable
just
as
we
see
the
first
stage
of
early
youth
come
to
an
end
when
the
distinction
between
boy
and
girl
becomes
altogether
definite
so
we
may
observe
that
the
important
activity
of
the
process
of
life
has
run
its
course
when
this
distinction
begins
to
degenerate
it
is
essentially
defined
by
the
approximation
to
each
other
of
the
external
appearance
of
the
two
sexes
their
voices
their
inner
character
and
their
attitude
what
is
typically
masculine
or
feminine
disappears
it
is
at
this
point
that
extreme
old
age
begins
the
number
of
years
the
degree
of
intelligence
education
and
other
differences
are
of
small
importance
and
the
ensuing
particularities
may
be
easily
deduced
by
a
consideration
of
the
nature
of
extreme
old
age
the
task
of
life
is
ended
because
the
physical
powers
have
no
longer
any
scope
for
the
same
reason
resistance
to
enemies
has
become
lessened
courage
has
decreased
care
about
physical
welfare
increased
everything
occurs
more
slowly
and
with
greater
difficulty
and
all
because
of
the
weakness
which
from
now
on
becomes
the
denotative
trait
of
that
whole
bit
of
human
nature
hence
lombroso
is
not
wrong
in
saying
that
the
characteristic
diseases
of
extreme
old
age
are
rarer
among
women
than
among
men
this
is
so
because
the
change
in
women
is
not
so
sudden
nor
so
powerful
since
they
are
weak
to
begin
with
while
man
becomes
a
weak
graybeard
suddenly
and
out
of
the
fullness
of
his
manly
strength
the
change
is
so
great
the
difference
so
significant
and
painful
that
the
consequence
must
be
a
series
of
unpleasant
properties
egoism
excitability
moroseness
cruelty
etc
it
is
significant
that
the
very
old
man
assumes
all
those
unpleasant
characteristics
we
note
in
eunuchs
they
result
from
the
consciousness
of
having
lost
power
it
is
from
this
fact
that
kraus
loc
cit
deduces
the
crimes
of
extreme
old
age
excitable
weakness
of
the
old
man
brings
him
into
great
danger
of
becoming
a
criminal
the
excitability
is
opposed
to
slowness
and
in
thought
he
is
easily
surprised
by
irrelevancies
he
is
torn
from
his
drowse
and
behaves
like
a
somnolent
drunkard
the
very
old
individual
is
a
fanatic
about
rest
every
disturbance
of
his
rest
troubles
him
hence
all
his
anger
all
his
teasing
and
quarreling
all
his
obstinacy
and
stiffness
have
a
single
device
me
this
somnolent
drunkenness
is
variously
valued
henry
holland
in
one
of
his
papers
said
that
age
approximates
a
condition
of
dreams
in
which
illusion
and
reality
are
easily
confused
but
this
can
be
true
only
of
the
last
stages
of
extreme
old
age
when
life
has
become
a
very
weak
vegetative
function
but
hardly
any
crimes
are
committed
by
people
in
this
stage
it
would
be
simpler
to
say
that
the
old
weakness
gives
the
earlier
tendencies
of
his
youth
a
definite
direction
which
may
lead
to
crime
all
diseases
develop
in
the
direction
of
the
newly
developing
weakness
but
selfishness
or
greed
are
not
young
hence
we
must
assume
that
an
aging
man
who
has
turned
miser
began
by
being
prudent
but
that
he
did
not
deny
himself
and
his
friends
because
he
knew
that
he
was
able
to
restore
later
what
they
consumed
now
he
is
old
and
weak
he
knows
that
he
can
no
longer
do
this
easily
that
his
money
and
property
are
all
that
he
has
to
depend
on
in
his
old
age
and
hence
he
is
very
much
afraid
of
losing
or
decreasing
them
so
that
his
prudence
becomes
miserliness
later
mania
for
possession
and
even
worse
finally
it
may
turn
him
into
a
criminal
the
situation
is
the
same
sexually
too
weak
to
satisfy
natural
instincts
in
adults
he
attacks
immature
girls
and
his
fear
of
people
he
can
no
longer
otherwise
oppose
turns
him
into
a
poisoner
drobisch
finds
that
by
reason
of
the
alteration
of
characteristics
definite
elements
of
the
self
are
distinguishable
at
every
stage
the
distinguishing
element
in
extreme
old
age
in
senility
is
the
loss
of
power
and
if
we
keep
this
in
mind
we
shall
be
able
to
explain
every
phenomenon
characteristic
of
this
period
senile
individuals
require
especial
treatment
as
witnesses
an
accurate
study
of
such
people
and
of
the
not
literature
concerning
them
will
however
yield
a
sufficient
basis
to
go
on
what
is
most
important
can
be
found
in
any
on
psychology
the
individual
cases
are
considerably
helped
by
the
assumption
that
the
mental
organization
of
senility
is
essentially
simplified
and
narrowed
to
a
few
types
its
activities
are
lessened
its
influences
and
aims
are
compressed
the
present
brings
little
and
is
little
remembered
so
that
its
collective
character
is
determined
by
a
resultant
composed
of
those
forces
that
have
influenced
the
past
life
accurate
observation
will
reveal
only
two
types
of
senility
there
is
the
embittered
type
and
there
is
the
character
expressed
in
the
phrase
understand
all
is
to
forgive
senility
rarely
succeeds
in
presenting
facts
objectively
everything
it
tells
is
bound
up
with
its
judgment
and
its
judgment
is
either
negative
or
positive
the
nature
depends
less
on
the
old
emotional
character
than
on
his
experience
in
life
if
he
is
one
of
the
embittered
he
will
probably
so
describe
a
possibly
harmful
but
not
bad
event
as
to
be
able
to
complain
of
the
wickedness
of
the
world
which
brought
it
about
that
at
one
time
such
and
such
an
evil
happened
to
him
the
excusing
senile
will
begin
with
god
it
so
bad
the
people
were
young
and
merry
and
so
one
of
them
that
the
same
event
is
presented
in
a
fundamentally
different
light
by
each
is
obvious
fortunately
the
senile
is
easily
seen
through
and
his
first
words
show
how
he
looks
at
things
he
makes
difficulties
mainly
by
introducing
memories
which
always
color
and
modify
the
evidence
the
familiar
fact
that
very
old
men
remember
things
long
past
better
than
immediate
occurrences
is
to
be
explained
by
the
situation
that
the
ancient
brain
retains
only
that
which
it
has
frequently
experienced
old
experiences
are
recalled
in
memory
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
times
and
hence
may
take
deep
root
there
while
the
new
could
be
repeated
only
a
few
times
and
hence
had
not
time
to
find
a
place
before
being
forgotten
if
the
old
man
tells
of
some
recent
event
some
similar
remote
event
is
also
alive
in
his
mind
the
latter
has
however
if
not
more
vivid
at
least
equally
vigorous
color
so
that
the
old
story
is
frequently
composed
of
things
long
past
i
do
not
know
how
to
eliminate
these
old
memories
from
this
story
there
are
always
difficulties
particularly
as
personal
experiences
of
evil
generally
dominate
these
memories
it
is
not
unjust
that
proverb
which
says
youth
is
at
all
silly
old
age
remembers
it
section
d
differences
in
conception
i
should
like
to
add
to
what
precedes
that
senility
presents
fact
and
judgment
together
in
a
certain
sense
every
age
and
person
does
so
and
as
i
have
repeatedly
said
it
would
be
foolish
to
assert
that
we
have
the
right
to
demand
only
facts
from
witnesses
setting
aside
the
presence
of
inferences
in
most
every
exposition
contains
without
exception
the
judgment
of
its
though
only
perhaps
in
a
few
dry
words
it
may
lie
in
some
choice
expression
in
the
tone
in
the
gesture
but
it
is
there
open
to
careful
observation
consider
any
simple
event
two
drunkards
quarreling
in
the
street
and
suppose
we
instruct
any
one
of
many
witnesses
to
tell
us
only
the
facts
he
will
do
so
but
with
the
introductory
words
was
a
very
ordinary
event
a
joke
harmless
disgusting
funny
disgusting
piece
of
the
history
of
morals
sad
of
humanity
dangerous
interesting
real
study
for
hell
a
picture
of
the
future
etc
now
is
it
possible
to
think
that
people
who
have
so
variously
characterized
the
same
event
will
give
an
identical
description
of
the
mere
fact
they
have
seen
the
event
in
accordance
with
their
attitude
toward
life
one
has
seen
nothing
another
this
another
that
and
although
the
thing
might
have
lasted
only
a
very
short
time
it
made
such
an
impression
that
each
has
in
mind
a
completely
different
picture
which
he
now
reproduces
as
volkmar
said
nation
hears
in
thunder
the
clangor
of
trumpets
the
of
divine
steeds
the
quarrels
of
the
dragons
of
heaven
another
hears
the
mooing
of
the
cow
the
chirp
of
the
cricket
the
complaint
of
the
ancestors
still
another
hears
the
saints
turn
the
vault
of
heaven
and
the
greenlander
even
the
quarrel
of
bewitched
women
concerning
a
dried
and
voltaire
says
you
ask
the
devil
what
beauty
is
he
will
tell
you
that
beauty
is
a
pair
of
horns
four
hoofs
and
a
yet
when
we
ask
a
witness
what
is
beautiful
we
think
that
we
are
asking
for
a
brute
fact
and
expect
as
reliable
an
answer
as
from
a
mathematician
we
might
as
well
ask
for
cleanliness
from
a
person
who
thinks
he
has
set
his
house
in
order
by
having
swept
the
dirt
from
one
corner
to
another
to
compare
the
varieties
of
intellectual
attitude
among
men
generally
we
must
start
with
which
combined
with
mental
perception
makes
a
not
insignificant
difference
in
each
individual
astronomers
first
discovered
the
existence
of
this
difference
in
that
they
showed
that
various
observers
of
contemporaneous
events
do
not
observe
at
the
same
time
this
fact
is
called
personal
whether
the
difference
in
rate
of
or
the
difference
of
intellectual
apprehension
or
of
both
together
are
here
responsible
is
not
known
but
the
proved
distinction
even
to
a
second
is
so
much
the
more
important
since
events
which
succeed
each
other
very
rapidly
may
cause
individual
observers
to
have
quite
different
images
and
we
know
as
little
whether
the
slower
or
the
quicker
observer
sees
more
correctly
as
we
little
know
what
people
perceive
more
quickly
or
more
slowly
now
inasmuch
as
we
are
unable
to
test
individual
differences
with
special
instruments
we
must
satisfy
ourselves
with
the
fact
that
there
are
different
varieties
of
conception
and
that
these
may
be
of
especial
importance
in
doubtful
cases
such
as
brawls
sudden
attacks
cheating
at
cards
etc
the
next
degree
of
difference
is
in
the
difference
of
observation
schiel
says
that
the
observer
is
not
he
who
sees
the
thing
but
who
sees
of
what
parts
it
is
made
the
talent
for
such
vision
is
rare
one
man
overlooks
half
because
he
is
inattentive
or
is
looking
at
the
wrong
place
another
substitutes
his
own
inferences
for
objects
while
another
tends
to
observe
the
quality
of
objects
and
neglects
their
quantity
and
still
another
divides
what
is
to
be
united
and
unites
what
is
to
be
separated
if
we
keep
in
mind
what
profound
differences
may
result
in
this
way
we
must
recognize
the
source
of
the
conflicting
assertions
by
witnesses
and
we
shall
have
to
grant
that
these
differences
would
become
incomparably
greater
and
more
important
if
the
witnesses
were
not
required
to
talk
of
the
event
immediately
or
later
on
thus
approximating
their
different
conceptions
to
some
average
hence
we
often
discover
that
when
the
witnesses
really
have
had
no
chance
to
discuss
the
matter
and
have
heard
no
account
of
it
from
a
third
person
or
have
not
seen
the
consequences
of
the
deed
their
discussions
of
it
showed
distinct
and
essential
differences
merely
through
the
lack
of
an
opportunity
or
a
standard
of
correction
and
we
then
suppose
that
a
part
of
what
the
witnesses
have
said
is
untrue
or
assume
that
they
were
inattentive
or
blind
views
are
of
similar
importance
fiesto
exclaims
is
scandalous
to
empty
a
full
purse
it
is
impertinent
to
misappropriate
a
million
but
it
is
unnamably
great
to
steal
a
crown
the
shame
decreases
with
the
increase
of
the
exner
holds
that
the
ancients
conceived
oedipus
not
as
we
do
they
found
his
misfortune
horrible
we
find
it
unpleasant
these
are
poetical
criminal
cases
presented
to
us
from
different
points
of
view
and
we
nowadays
understand
the
same
action
still
more
differently
and
not
only
in
poetry
but
in
the
daily
life
try
for
example
to
get
various
individuals
to
judge
the
same
formation
of
clouds
you
may
hear
the
clouds
called
with
spiritual
blossoms
impoverished
students
stormy
sea
camel
monkey
battling
giants
swarm
of
flies
prophet
with
a
flowing
beard
dunderhead
etc
we
have
coming
to
light
in
this
accidental
interpretation
of
fact
the
view
of
life
his
intimacies
etc
this
emergence
is
as
observable
in
the
interpretation
also
of
the
ordinary
events
of
the
daily
life
there
even
if
the
judgments
do
not
vary
very
much
they
are
still
different
enough
to
indicate
quite
distinct
points
of
view
the
memory
of
the
curious
judgment
of
one
has
helped
me
many
a
time
to
explain
testimonies
that
seemed
to
have
no
possible
connection
or
this
indefinable
factor
exercises
a
great
influence
on
conception
and
interpretation
it
is
much
more
wonderful
than
even
the
march
of
events
or
of
fate
itself
everybody
knows
what
attitude
stimmung
is
everybody
has
suffered
from
it
everybody
has
made
some
use
of
it
but
nobody
can
altogether
define
it
according
to
fischer
attitude
consists
in
the
compounded
feelings
of
all
the
inner
conditions
and
changes
of
the
organism
expressed
in
consciousness
this
would
make
attitude
a
sort
of
vital
feeling
the
resultant
of
the
now
favorable
now
unfavorable
functioning
of
our
organs
the
description
is
however
not
unexceptionable
inasmuch
as
single
apparently
insignificant
influences
upon
our
senses
may
create
or
alter
our
attitudes
for
a
long
time
without
revealing
its
effect
on
any
organ
or
its
integration
with
the
other
mental
states
i
know
how
merely
good
or
bad
weather
determines
attitude
how
it
may
be
helped
immediately
by
a
good
cigar
and
how
often
we
may
pass
a
day
joyous
or
dejected
only
to
discover
that
the
cause
is
a
good
or
a
bad
dream
of
the
foregoing
night
especially
instructive
in
this
regard
was
a
little
experience
of
mine
during
an
official
journey
the
trouble
which
brought
me
out
was
an
ordinary
brawl
between
young
peasants
one
of
whom
was
badly
cut
up
and
was
to
be
examined
over
we
had
to
wait
at
a
wayside
inn
where
i
expected
a
relieving
gendarme
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
the
stop
when
we
renewed
the
journey
i
found
myself
overcome
by
unspeakable
sadness
and
this
very
customary
brawl
seemed
to
me
especially
unpleasant
i
sympathized
with
the
wounded
boy
his
parents
his
opponents
all
strangers
to
me
and
i
bewrayed
the
rawness
of
mankind
its
love
for
liquor
etc
this
attitude
was
so
striking
that
i
began
to
seek
its
cause
i
found
it
first
of
all
in
the
dreary
region
then
in
the
cup
of
hot
coffee
that
i
had
drunk
in
the
restaurant
which
might
possibly
have
been
poisonous
finally
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
of
the
horses
were
tuned
to
a
very
saddening
minor
chord
the
coachman
in
his
hurry
had
forgotten
to
take
bells
with
him
and
in
order
to
avoid
violating
police
regulations
he
had
borrowed
at
the
inn
another
peal
and
my
sad
state
dated
from
the
moment
i
heard
it
i
banished
the
sound
and
immediately
i
found
myself
enjoying
the
pretty
scenery
i
am
convinced
that
if
i
had
been
called
to
testify
in
my
sad
state
i
would
have
told
the
story
otherwise
than
normally
the
influence
of
music
upon
attitude
is
very
well
known
the
unknown
influence
of
external
conditions
also
makes
a
difference
on
attitude
you
are
absorbed
in
thought
says
fechner
notice
neither
sunshine
nor
the
green
of
the
meadows
and
still
you
are
in
a
quite
different
emotional
condition
from
that
which
would
possess
you
in
a
dark
the
attitude
we
call
indifference
is
of
particular
import
it
appears
especially
when
the
ego
because
of
powerful
impressions
is
concerned
with
itself
pain
sadness
important
work
reflection
disease
etc
in
this
condition
we
depreciate
or
undervalue
the
significance
of
everything
that
occurs
about
us
everything
is
brought
into
relation
to
our
personal
immediate
condition
and
is
from
the
point
of
view
of
our
egoism
more
or
less
indifferent
it
does
not
matter
whether
this
attitude
of
indifference
occurs
at
the
time
of
perception
or
at
the
time
of
restatement
during
the
examination
in
either
case
the
fact
is
robbed
of
its
hardness
its
significance
and
its
importance
what
was
white
or
black
is
described
as
gray
there
is
another
and
similar
attitude
which
is
distinguished
by
the
fact
that
we
are
never
quite
aware
of
it
but
are
much
subject
to
it
according
to
lipps
and
lotze
there
is
to
be
observed
in
neurotic
attitudes
a
not
rare
and
complete
indifference
to
feeling
and
in
consciousness
an
essential
lack
of
in
perception
our
existence
our
own
being
seems
to
us
then
to
be
a
foreign
thing
having
little
concern
with
us
a
story
we
need
not
earnestly
consider
that
in
such
condition
little
attention
is
paid
to
what
is
going
on
around
us
seems
clear
enough
the
experiences
are
shadowy
and
superficial
they
are
indifferent
and
are
represented
as
such
only
this
condition
is
very
dangerous
in
the
law
court
because
where
a
conscientious
witness
will
tell
us
that
at
the
time
of
the
observation
or
the
examination
he
was
sick
or
troubled
and
therefore
was
incorrect
a
person
utterly
detached
in
the
way
described
does
not
tell
the
judge
of
his
condition
probably
because
he
does
not
know
anything
about
it
there
are
certain
mental
and
physical
situations
which
lead
to
quite
a
different
view
those
who
are
suffering
physically
those
who
have
deeply
wounded
feelings
and
those
who
have
been
reduced
by
worry
are
examined
in
the
same
way
as
normal
people
yet
they
need
to
be
measured
by
quite
a
different
standard
again
we
are
sometimes
likely
to
suppose
great
passions
that
have
long
since
passed
their
period
to
be
as
influential
as
they
were
in
their
prime
we
know
that
love
and
hate
disappear
in
the
distance
and
that
love
long
dead
and
a
hatred
tend
to
express
themselves
as
a
feeling
of
mildness
and
forgiveness
which
is
pretty
much
the
same
in
spite
of
its
diverse
sources
if
the
examiner
knows
that
a
great
passion
whether
of
hate
or
of
love
exists
he
thinks
he
is
fooled
when
he
finds
a
full
calm
and
objective
judgment
instead
of
it
it
seems
impossible
to
him
and
he
either
does
not
believe
the
probably
accurate
witness
or
colors
his
testimony
with
that
knowledge
bodily
conditions
are
still
more
remarkable
in
effecting
differences
in
point
of
view
here
no
is
presented
since
no
change
occurs
in
the
changes
are
such
that
arise
after
the
perception
during
the
process
of
judgment
and
interpretation
we
might
like
an
idea
when
lying
down
that
displeases
us
when
we
stand
up
examination
shows
that
this
attitude
varies
with
the
difference
in
the
quantity
of
blood
in
the
brain
in
these
two
positions
and
this
fact
may
explain
a
whole
series
of
phenomena
first
of
all
it
is
related
to
and
the
execution
of
plans
everybody
knows
how
while
lying
in
bed
a
great
many
plans
occur
that
seem
good
the
moment
you
get
up
new
considerations
arise
and
the
plan
is
progressively
abandoned
now
this
does
not
mean
anything
so
long
as
nothing
was
undertaken
in
the
first
situation
which
might
be
binding
for
the
resolution
then
made
for
example
when
two
lying
in
bed
have
made
a
definite
plan
each
is
later
ashamed
before
the
other
to
withdraw
from
it
so
we
often
hear
from
criminals
that
they
were
sorry
about
certain
plans
but
since
they
were
once
resolved
upon
they
were
carried
out
numbers
of
such
phenomena
many
of
them
quite
unbelievable
in
appearance
may
be
retroduced
to
similar
sources
a
like
thing
occurs
when
a
witness
reflects
about
some
event
while
he
is
in
bed
when
he
thinks
of
it
again
he
is
convinced
perhaps
that
the
matter
really
occurred
in
quite
another
way
than
he
had
newly
supposed
it
to
now
he
may
convince
himself
that
the
time
at
which
he
made
the
reflections
was
nearer
the
event
and
hence
those
reflections
must
have
been
the
more
correct
ones
in
that
case
he
sticks
to
his
first
story
although
that
might
have
been
incorrect
helmholtz
has
pointed
to
something
similar
colors
of
a
landscape
appear
to
be
much
more
living
and
definite
when
they
are
looked
at
obliquely
or
when
they
are
looked
at
with
the
head
upside
down
than
when
they
are
looked
at
with
the
head
in
its
ordinary
position
with
the
head
upside
down
we
try
correctly
to
judge
objects
and
know
that
green
meadows
at
a
certain
distance
have
a
rather
altered
coloration
we
become
used
to
that
fact
discount
the
change
and
identify
the
green
of
distant
objects
with
the
shade
of
green
belonging
to
near
objects
besides
we
see
the
landscape
from
the
new
position
as
a
flat
image
and
incidentally
we
see
clouds
in
right
perspective
and
the
landscape
flat
like
clouds
when
we
see
them
in
the
ordinary
of
course
everybody
knows
this
and
of
course
in
a
criminal
case
such
considerations
will
hardly
ever
play
any
r√¥le
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
also
a
matter
of
course
that
the
reason
for
these
differences
might
likewise
be
the
reason
for
a
great
many
others
not
yet
discovered
and
yet
of
great
significance
to
criminalists
such
is
the
situation
with
regard
to
comparison
schiel
laid
much
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
two
lines
of
unequal
length
seem
equal
when
they
diverge
although
their
difference
is
recognized
immediately
if
they
are
parallel
close
together
and
start
from
the
same
level
he
says
that
the
situation
is
similar
in
all
comparison
if
things
may
be
juxtaposed
they
can
be
compared
if
not
the
comparison
is
bound
to
be
bad
there
is
no
question
of
illusion
here
merely
of
convenience
of
manipulation
juxtaposition
is
frequently
important
not
for
the
practical
convenience
of
comparison
but
because
we
must
know
whether
the
witness
has
discovered
the
right
juxtaposition
only
if
he
has
can
his
comparison
have
been
good
to
discover
whether
he
has
requires
careful
examination
conception
and
interpretation
are
considerably
dependent
on
the
interest
which
is
brought
to
the
object
examined
there
is
a
story
of
a
memory
of
an
old
man
which
was
not
a
memory
of
the
man
but
only
of
a
green
sleeve
and
a
wrinkled
hand
presenting
a
cake
of
chocolate
the
child
was
interested
only
in
the
chocolate
and
hence
understood
it
and
its
nearest
environment
the
hand
and
the
sleeve
we
may
easily
observe
similar
cases
in
some
great
brawl
the
witness
may
have
seen
only
what
was
happening
to
his
brother
the
numismatist
may
have
observed
only
a
bracelet
with
a
rare
coin
in
a
heap
of
stolen
valuables
in
a
long
anarchistic
speech
the
witness
may
have
heard
only
what
threatened
his
own
welfare
and
so
on
the
very
thing
looks
different
if
for
whatever
reason
it
is
uninteresting
or
intensely
interesting
a
color
is
quite
different
when
it
is
in
fashion
a
flower
different
when
we
know
it
to
be
artificial
the
sun
is
brighter
at
home
and
fruit
tastes
better
but
there
is
still
another
group
of
specific
influences
on
our
conceptions
and
interpretations
the
examples
of
which
have
been
increasing
unbrokenly
one
of
these
is
the
variety
in
the
significance
of
words
words
have
become
symbols
of
concepts
and
simple
words
have
come
to
mean
involved
mathematical
and
philosophical
ideas
it
is
conceivable
that
two
men
may
connote
quite
different
things
by
the
word
and
even
in
thinking
and
construing
in
making
use
of
perceived
facts
different
conceptions
may
arise
through
presenting
the
fact
to
another
with
symbols
that
to
him
signify
different
things
the
difference
may
perhaps
not
be
great
but
when
it
is
taken
in
connection
with
the
associations
and
suggestions
of
the
word
used
small
mistakes
multiply
and
the
result
is
quite
different
from
what
it
might
have
been
if
another
meaning
had
been
the
the
use
of
foreign
words
in
a
sense
different
from
that
used
by
us
may
lead
us
far
astray
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
meaning
of
the
foreign
word
frequently
does
not
coincide
with
the
sense
it
has
in
the
dictionary
hence
it
is
dangerous
in
adducing
evidence
to
use
foreign
expressions
when
it
is
important
to
adhere
strictly
to
a
single
meaning
taine
says
correctly
and
amour
girl
and
jeune
fille
song
and
chanson
are
not
identical
although
they
are
substituted
for
one
it
is
moreover
pointed
out
that
children
especially
are
glad
to
substitute
and
alter
ideas
for
which
one
word
stands
so
that
they
expand
or
contract
its
meaning
haphazard
may
first
mean
a
dog
then
a
horse
then
all
animals
and
a
child
who
was
once
shown
a
fir
tree
in
the
forest
said
it
a
fir
tree
for
fir
trees
come
only
at
christmas
this
process
is
not
confined
to
children
at
one
time
or
another
we
hear
a
word
as
soon
as
we
hear
it
we
connect
it
with
an
idea
this
connection
will
rarely
be
correct
largely
because
we
have
heard
the
word
for
the
first
time
later
we
get
our
idea
from
events
in
which
this
word
occurs
of
course
in
connection
with
the
object
we
instantaneously
understand
the
word
to
mean
in
time
we
learn
another
word
and
word
and
meaning
have
changed
correctly
or
incorrectly
a
comparison
of
these
changes
in
individuals
would
show
how
easy
both
approximations
and
diversifications
in
meaning
are
it
must
follow
that
any
number
of
misunderstandings
can
develop
and
many
an
alteration
in
the
conception
of
justice
and
decency
considered
through
a
long
period
may
become
very
significant
in
indicating
the
changes
in
the
meaning
of
words
many
a
time
if
we
bear
thoroughly
in
mind
the
mere
changes
in
the
meaning
of
the
word
standing
for
a
doubtful
fact
we
put
ourselves
in
possession
of
the
history
of
morals
even
the
most
important
quarrels
would
lapse
if
the
quarreling
persons
could
get
emotionally
at
the
intent
of
their
words
in
this
connection
questions
of
honor
offer
a
broad
field
of
examples
it
is
well
known
that
german
is
rich
in
words
that
show
personal
dislikes
and
also
that
the
greater
portion
of
these
words
are
harmless
in
themselves
but
one
man
understands
this
the
other
that
when
he
hears
the
words
and
finally
german
is
in
the
curious
position
of
being
the
cause
of
the
largest
number
of
attacks
on
honor
and
of
cases
of
slander
in
the
world
where
the
frenchman
laughs
and
becomes
witty
the
german
grows
sullen
insulting
and
looks
for
trouble
the
french
call
sensitiveness
to
insignificant
and
worthless
things
the
german
way
of
quarreling
faire
querelle
many
a
slander
case
in
court
is
easily
settled
by
showing
people
the
value
of
the
word
many
who
complained
that
they
were
called
a
creature
a
person
went
away
satisfied
as
soon
as
the
whole
meaning
of
the
words
had
been
explained
to
them
in
conclusion
just
a
word
concerning
the
influence
of
time
on
conception
not
the
length
of
past
time
but
the
value
of
the
is
what
is
important
in
determining
an
event
according
to
herbart
there
is
a
form
of
temporal
repetition
and
time
is
the
form
of
repetition
if
he
is
right
it
is
inevitable
that
time
or
must
influence
the
conception
of
events
it
is
that
monotony
in
the
run
of
time
makes
it
seem
slow
while
time
full
of
events
goes
swiftly
but
appears
long
in
memory
because
a
large
number
of
points
have
to
be
thought
through
m√ºnsterberg
shows
that
we
have
to
stop
at
every
separate
point
and
so
time
seems
in
memory
longer
but
this
is
not
universally
valid
aristotle
had
already
pointed
out
that
a
familiar
road
appears
to
be
shorter
than
an
unfamiliar
one
and
this
is
contradictory
to
the
first
proposition
so
a
series
of
days
flies
away
if
we
spend
them
quietly
and
calmly
in
vacation
in
the
country
their
swiftness
is
surprising
then
when
something
of
importance
occurs
in
our
life
and
it
is
directly
succeeded
by
a
calm
eventless
period
this
seems
very
long
in
memory
although
it
should
have
seemed
long
when
it
occurred
and
short
in
the
past
these
and
similar
phenomena
are
quite
unexplained
and
all
that
can
be
said
after
numerous
experiments
is
that
we
conceive
short
times
as
long
and
long
times
as
short
now
we
may
add
the
remarkable
fact
that
most
people
have
no
idea
of
the
duration
of
very
small
times
especially
of
the
minute
ask
any
individual
to
sit
absolutely
quiet
without
counting
or
doing
anything
else
and
to
indicate
the
passing
of
each
minute
up
to
five
he
will
say
that
the
five
minutes
have
passed
at
the
end
of
never
more
than
a
minute
and
a
half
so
witnesses
in
estimating
time
will
make
mistakes
also
and
these
mistakes
and
other
nonsense
are
written
into
the
protocols
there
are
two
means
of
correction
either
have
the
witness
determine
the
time
in
terms
of
some
familiar
form
a
paternoster
or
give
him
the
watch
and
let
him
observe
the
second
hand
in
the
latter
case
he
will
assert
that
his
ten
or
his
five
or
his
twenty
minutes
were
at
most
no
more
than
a
half
or
a
whole
minute
the
problem
of
time
is
still
more
difficult
when
the
examination
has
to
be
made
with
regard
to
the
estimation
of
still
longer
periods
weeks
months
or
years
there
is
no
means
of
making
any
test
the
only
thing
that
experience
definitely
shows
is
that
the
certainty
of
such
estimates
depends
on
their
being
fixed
by
distinct
events
if
anybody
says
that
event
a
occurred
four
or
five
days
before
event
b
we
may
believe
him
if
he
adds
when
a
occurred
we
began
to
cut
corn
and
when
b
occurred
we
harvested
it
and
between
these
two
events
there
were
four
or
five
if
he
can
not
adduce
similar
judgments
we
must
never
depend
upon
him
for
things
may
have
occurred
which
have
so
influenced
his
conception
of
time
that
he
judges
altogether
falsely
it
often
happens
in
such
cases
that
defective
estimates
made
in
the
course
of
lengthy
explanations
suddenly
become
points
of
reference
and
then
if
wrong
are
the
cause
of
mistakes
suppose
that
a
witness
once
said
that
an
event
occurred
four
years
ago
much
later
an
estimation
of
the
time
is
undertaken
which
shows
that
the
hasty
statement
sets
the
event
in
and
then
all
the
most
important
conclusions
are
merely
argued
from
that
it
is
best
as
is
customary
in
such
cases
to
test
the
uncertainty
and
incorrectness
of
these
estimates
of
time
on
oneself
it
may
be
assumed
that
the
witness
in
the
case
in
question
is
likely
to
have
made
a
better
estimate
but
it
may
equally
be
assumed
that
he
has
not
done
so
in
short
the
conception
of
periods
of
time
can
not
be
dealt
with
too
cautiously

is
able

what

influence
of
criminologically
the
influence
of
nurture
on
mankind
is
important
if
it
can
explain
the
development
of
morality
honorableness
and
love
of
truth
the
criminalist
has
to
study
relations
actions
and
assertions
to
value
and
to
compare
them
when
they
are
differentiable
only
in
terms
of
the
nurture
of
those
who
are
responsible
for
them
the
most
instructive
works
on
this
problem
are
those
of
tarde
and
among
the
older
writers
leibnitz
had
already
said
you

ribot
says
that
training
has
least
effect
at
the
two
extremes
of
humanity
little
and
transitively
on
the
idiot
much
on
the
average
man
not
at
all
on
the
genius
i
might
add
that
the
circle
of
idiots
and
geniuses
must
be
made
extremely
large
for
average
people
are
very
few
in
number
and
the
increase
in
intellectual
training
has
made
no
statistical
difference
on
the
curve
of
crime
this
is
one
of
the
conclusions
arrived
at
by
adolf
wagner
which
corroborates
the
experience
of
practising
lawyers
and
we
who
have
had
during
the
growth
of
popular
education
the
opportunity
to
make
observations
from
the
criminalistic
standpoint
know
nothing
favorable
to
its
influence
if
the
general
assertion
is
true
that
increased
national
education
has
reduced
brawling
damages
to
property
and
has
increased
swindling
misappropriations
we
have
made
a
great
mistake
for
the
psychological
estimation
of
a
criminal
the
crime
itself
is
not
definitive
there
is
always
the
question
as
to
the
damage
this
individual
has
done
his
own
nature
with
his
deed
if
then
a
peasant
lad
hits
his
neighbor
with
the
leg
of
a
chair
or
destroys
fences
or
perhaps
a
whole
village
he
may
still
be
the
most
honorable
of
youths
and
later
grow
up
into
a
universally
respected
man
many
of
the
best
and
most
useful
village
mayors
have
been
guilty
in
their
youth
of
brawls
damages
to
property
resistance
to
authority
and
similar
things
but
if
a
man
has
once
swindled
or
killed
anybody
he
has
lost
his
honor
and
as
a
rule
remains
a
scoundrel
for
the
rest
of
his
life
if
for
criminals
of
the
first
kind
we
substitute
the
latter
type
we
get
a
very
bad
outlook
individuals
yield
similar
experiences
the
most
important
characteristic
of
a
somewhat
cultivated
man
who
not
only
is
able
to
read
and
to
write
but
makes
some
use
of
his
knowledge
is
a
discontent
with
his
existence
if
he
once
has
acquired
the
desire
to
read
the
little
time
he
has
is
not
sufficient
to
satisfy
it
and
when
he
has
more
time
he
is
always
compelled
to
lay
aside
his
volume
of
poetry
to
feed
the
pigs
or
to
clean
the
stables
he
learns
moreover
of
a
number
of
needs
which
he
can
not
satisfy
but
which
books
have
instilled
in
him
and
finally
he
seeks
illegal
means
as
we
criminalists
know
for
their
satisfaction
in
many
countries
the
law
of
such
cases
considers
extenuating
circumstances
and
defective
but
it
has
never
yet
occurred
to
a
single
criminalist
that
people
might
be
likely
to
commit
crime
because
they
could
not
read
or
write
nevertheless
we
are
frequently
in
touch
with
an
old
peasant
as
witness
who
gives
the
impression
of
absolute
integrity
reliability
and
wisdom
so
much
so
that
it
is
gain
for
anybody
to
talk
to
him
but
though
the
black
art
of
reading
and
writing
has
been
foreign
to
him
through
the
whole
of
his
life
nobody
will
have
any
accusation
to
make
against
him
about
defective
the
exhibition
of
unattainable
goods
to
the
mass
of
mankind
is
a
question
of
conscience
we
must
of
course
assume
that
deficiency
in
education
is
not
in
itself
a
reason
for
doubting
the
witness
or
for
holding
an
individual
inclined
to
crime
the
mistakes
in
like
spoiling
rigor
neglect
and
their
consequences
laziness
deceit
and
larceny
have
a
sufficiently
evil
outcome
and
how
far
these
are
at
fault
and
how
far
the
nature
of
the
individual
himself
can
be
determined
only
in
each
concrete
case
by
itself
it
will
not
occur
to
anybody
to
wish
for
a
return
to
savagery
and
anarchy
because
of
the
low
value
we
set
on
the
training
of
the
mind
there
is
still
the
business
of
moral
training
and
its
importance
can
not
be
overestimated
considering
the
subject
generally
we
may
say
that
the
aim
of
education
is
the
capacity
of
sympathizing
with
the
feeling
understanding
and
willing
of
other
minds
this
might
be
supplemented
perhaps
also
with
the
limitation
that
the
sympathy
must
be
correct
profound
and
implicative
for
external
approximate
or
inverted
sympathy
will
obviously
not
do
the
servant
girl
knows
concerning
her
master
only
his
manner
of
quarreling
and
his
manner
of
spitting
but
is
absolutely
unaffected
by
and
strange
to
his
inner
life
the
darker
aspects
of
culture
and
civilization
are
most
obvious
in
the
external
contacts
of
mankind
when
we
begin
to
count
an
intelligent
sympathy
it
must
follow
that
the
sympathy
is
possible
only
with
regard
to
commonly
conceivable
matters
that
we
must
fundamentally
exclude
the
essential
inward
construction
of
the
mind
and
the
field
of
scientific
morality
hence
we
have
left
only
religion
which
is
the
working
morality
of
the
populace
according
to
goethe
the
great
fundamental
conflict
of
history
is
the
conflict
of
belief
with
doubt
a
discussion
of
this
conflict
is
unnecessary
here
it
is
mentioned
only
by
way
of
indicating
that
the
sole
training
on
which
the
criminalist
may
rely
is
that
of
real
religion
a
really
religious
person
is
a
reliable
witness
and
when
he
is
behind
the
bar
he
permits
at
least
the
assumption
that
he
is
innocent
of
course
it
is
difficult
to
determine
whether
he
is
genuinely
religious
or
not
but
if
genuine
religion
can
be
established
we
have
a
safe
starting
point
various
authors
have
discussed
the
influence
of
education
and
statistically
it
is
shown
that
in
russia
only
of
the
population
can
read
and
write
and
still
of
condemned
persons
no
fewer
than
were
literate
in
the
seventies
the
percentage
of
criminals
in
scotland
was
divided
as
follows
absolutely
illiterate
half
educated
well
educated
the
religious
statistics
are
altogether
worthless
a
part
of
them
have
nothing
to
do
with
religion
the
criminality
of
jews
one
part
is
worthless
because
it
deals
only
with
the
criminality
of
baptized
protestants
or
catholics
and
the
final
section
which
might
be
of
great
interest
the
criminality
of
believers
and
unbelievers
is
indeterminable
statistics
say
that
in
the
country
in
the
year
there
were
punished
x
protestants
y
catholics
etc
of
what
use
is
the
statement
both
among
the
x
and
the
y
percentages
there
were
many
absolute
unbelievers
and
it
is
indifferent
whether
they
were
protestant
or
catholic
unbelievers
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
what
percentage
of
the
catholics
and
of
the
protestants
are
really
faithful
for
if
we
rightly
assume
that
a
true
believer
rarely
commits
a
crime
we
should
be
able
to
say
which
religion
from
the
view
point
of
the
criminalist
should
be
encouraged
the
one
which
counts
the
greater
percentage
of
believers
of
course
but
we
shall
never
know
which
one
that
is
the
numbers
of
the
criminals
and
those
of
the

not
help
us
in
the
least
in
this
matter
section
views
of
the
discourse
is
nature
to
assimilate
discourse
as
it
is
given
is
with
this
statement
goethe
has
shown
where
the
deficiencies
in
culture
begin
and
observation
verifies
the
fact
that
the
uncultured
person
is
unable
to
accept
what
is
told
him
as
it
is
told
him
this
does
not
mean
that
uncultured
people
are
unable
to
remember
statements
as
they
are
made
but
that
they
are
unable
to
assimilate
any
perception
in
its
integrity
and
to
reproduce
it
in
its
natural
simplicity
this
is
the
alpha
and
the
omega
of
every
thing
observable
in
the
examination
of
simple
people
various
thinkers
in
different
fields
have
noted
this
fact
mill
observes
that
the
inability
to
distinguish
between
perception
and
inference
is
most
obvious
in
the
attempt
of
some
ignorant
person
to
describe
a
natural
phenomenon
douglas
stewart
notices
that
the
village
apothecary
will
rarely
describe
the
simplest
case
without
immediately
making
use
of
a
terminology
in
which
every
word
is
a
theory
the
simple
and
true
presentation
of
the
phenomenon
will
reveal
at
once
whether
the
mind
is
able
to
give
an
accurate
interpretation
of
nature
this
suggests
why
we
are
frequently
engaged
in
some
process
of
description
of
a
fact
in
itself
simple
it
has
been
presented
to
us
in
this
complicated
fashion
because
our
informants
did
not
know
how
to
speak
simply
so
kant
testimony
of
common
people
may
frequently
be
intended
honestly
but
it
is
not
often
reliable
because
the
witnesses
have
not
the
habit
of
prolonged
attention
and
so
they
mistake
what
they
think
themselves
for
what
they
hear
from
others
hence
even
though
they
take
oaths
they
can
hardly
be
hume
again
says
somewhere
in
the
essay
that
most
men
are
naturally
inclined
to
differentiate
their
discourse
inasmuch
as
they
see
their
object
from
one
side
only
do
not
think
of
the
objections
and
conceive
its
corroborative
principles
with
such
liveliness
that
they
pay
no
attention
to
those
which
look
another
way
now
whoever
sees
an
object
from
one
side
only
does
not
see
it
as
it
comes
to
him
and
whoever
refuses
to
think
of
objections
has
already
subjectively
colored
his
objects
and
no
longer
sees
them
as
they
are
in
this
regard
it
is
interesting
to
note
the
tendency
of
uneducated
people
to
define
things
they
are
not
interested
in
the
immediate
perception
but
in
its
abstract
form
the
best
example
of
this
is
the
famous
definition
of
honor
honor
is
that
thing
belonging
to
the
man
who
has
it
the
same
fault
is
committed
by
anybody
who
fails
to
apprehend
the
as
it
comes
but
perceives
only
what
is
most
obvious
and
nearest
mittermaier
has
pointed
out
that
the
accidental
witness
sees
only
the
nearest
characteristics
again
he
says
is
a
fact
that
uneducated
people
attend
only
to
the
question
that
was
asked
them
this
fact
is
important
if
a
witness
is
unskilfully
asked
in
one
breath
whether
he
murdered
a
robbed
b
and
stole
a
pear
from
c
he
will
probably
answer
with
calmness
i
have
not
stolen
a
pear
but
he
pays
no
attention
to
the
other
two
portions
of
the
question
this
characteristic
is
frequently
made
use
of
by
the
defense
the
lawyers
ask
some
important
witness
for
the
prosecution
you
say
that
you
have
seen
how
the
accused
entered
the
room
looked
around
approached
the
closet
and
then
drew
the
watch
toward
himself
the
uneducated
witness
then
says
dryly
i
can
not
say
that
although
he
has
seen
everything
except
the
concealment
of
the
watch
he
denies
the
whole
thing
solely
because
he
has
been
able
to
attend
to
the
last
portion
of
the
question
only
it
is
very
easy
to
look
out
for
these
characteristics
by
simply
not
permitting
a
number
of
questions
in
one
by
having
questions
put
in
the
simplest
and
clearest
possible
form
simple
questions
are
thankfully
received
and
get
better
answers
than
long
or
tricky
ones
for
the
same
reason
that
prevents
uneducated
people
from
ever
seeing
a
thing
as
it
comes
to
them
their
love
of
justice
depends
on
their
eagerness
to
avoid
becoming
themselves
subjects
of
injustice
hence
weak
people
can
never
be
honest
and
most
uneducated
people
understand
by
duty
that
which
are
to
do
duty
is
presented
as
required
of
all
men
but
it
is
more
comfortable
to
require
it
of
others
so
that
it
is
understood
as
only
so
required
it
may
be
due
to
the
fact
that
education
develops
quiet
imperturbability
and
that
this
is
conducive
to
correcter
vision
and
more
adequate
objectivity
in
both
events
and
obligations
there
is
another
series
of
processes
which
are
characteristic
of
the
point
of
view
of
the
uneducated
there
is
a
peculiar
recurring
mental
process
with
regard
to
the
careful
use
of
life
preservers
fire
extinguishers
and
other
means
of
escape
which
are
to
be
used
in
case
of
need
they
are
found
always
carefully
chained
up
or
hidden
in
closets
by
the
ignorant
this
is
possible
only
if
the
idea
of
protecting
oneself
against
sudden
need
does
not
make
itself
effective
as
such
but
is
forced
out
of
the
mind
by
the
desire
to
protect
oneself
against
theft
why
must
the
uneducated
carefully
feel
everything
that
is
shown
them
or
that
they
otherwise
find
to
be
new
children
even
smell
such
things
while
educated
people
are
satisfied
with
looking
at
them
the
request
in
public
places
not
touch
has
very
good
reason
i
believe
that
the
level
of
culture
of
an
individual
may
be
determined
without
much
mistake
by
his
inclination
to
touch
or
not
to
touch
some
new
object
presented
him
the
reason
for
this
desire
can
hardly
be
established
but
it
is
certainly
the
wish
of
the
uneducated
to
study
the
object
more
fundamentally
and
hence
to
bring
into
play
other
senses
than
that
of
sight
it
may
be
that
the
educated
man
sees
more
because
he
is
better
trained
in
careful
observation
so
that
the
uneducated
man
is
really
compelled
to
do
more
than
merely
to
look
on
the
other
hand
it
may
be
that
the
uneducated
man
here
again
fails
to
perceive
the
object
as
it
is
and
when
it
appears
to
him
as
object
a
or
is
indicated
as
that
object
he
is
inclined
to
disbelieve
and
must
convince
himself
by
careful
feeling
that
it
is
really
an
a
it
may
be
again
that
of
can
help
to
explain
the
matter
that
an
understanding
of
the
character
of
an
object
is
dependent
on
training
and
educated
observation
has
been
verified
many
times
incidentally
also
by
the
fact
that
the
uneducated
find
it
difficult
to
get
on
with
representations
now
this
can
not
be
accounted
for
by
only
their
defective
practice
the
old
but
instructive
story
of
the
who
asked
her
son
what
he
was
reading
the
black
or
the
white
repeats
itself
whenever
uneducated
people
are
shown
images
photographs
etc
for
a
long
time
i
had
not
noticed
that
they
see
the
background
as
the
thing
to
be
attended
to
when
for
example
you
show
an
uneducated
man
a
bust
photograph
it
may
happen
that
he
perceives
the
upper
surroundings
of
shoulder
and
head
as
the
lower
contours
of
the
background
which
is
to
indicate
some
fact
and
if
these
contours
happen
to
be
those
of
a
dog
the
man
sees
white
this
is
more
frequent
than
we
think
and
hence
we
must
pay
little
attention
to
failures
to
recognize
people
in
photographs
one
more
story
by
way
of
example
that
of
a
photographer
who
snapped
a
dozen
parading
young
dragoons
and
had
gotten
the
addresses
but
not
the
street
numbers
of
their
parents
he
sent
for
that
reason
to
the
twelve
parents
for
inspection
a
photograph
each
with
the
notice
that
if
some
mistake
had
occurred
he
would
rectify
it
but
not
a
parent
complained
of
the
failure
to
have
sent
them
the
pictures
of
their
own
children
each
had
received
a
soldier
and
appeared
to
be
quite
satisfied
with
the
correctness
of
his
image
hence
it
follows
again
that
denials
of
photographic
identity
by
the
uneducated
are
altogether
without
value
in
another
direction
images
have
a
peculiar
significance
for
children
and
ignorant
people
because
they
show
ineradicable
ideas
particularly
with
regard
to
size
nobody
recalls
any
book
so
vividly
as
his
first
picture
book
and
its
contents
we
remember
it
even
though
we
are
convinced
that
the
people
who
made
our
picture
book
were
quite
mistaken
now
as
it
frequently
happens
that
the
sizes
are
incorrectly
reproduced
as
when
a
horse
and
a
reindeer
occur
in
the
same
picture
and
the
latter
seems
bigger
than
the
former
the
reindeer
appears
in
imagination
always
bigger
it
does
not
matter
if
we
learn
later
how
big
a
reindeer
is
or
how
many
times
we
have
seen
one
we
still
find
the
animal
too
small
it
must
be
bigger
than
a
educated
adults
do
not
make
this
mistake
but
the
uneducated
do
and
many
false
statements
depend
on
ideas
derived
from
pictures
if
their
derivation
is
known
we
may
discover
the
source
of
the
mistake
but
if
the
mistake
occurred
unconsciously
then
we
have
to
combine
the
circumstances
and
study
further
to
find
the
reason
finally
the
general
influence
of
the
failure
of
ignorant
people
to
see
things
as
they
are
upon
their
is
shown
in
two
characteristic
stories
bulwer
tells
of
a
servant
whose
master
beat
him
and
who
was
instigated
to
seek
protection
in
court
he
refused
indignantly
inasmuch
as
his
master
was
too
noble
a
person
to
be
subject
to
law
and
gutberlet
tells
the
story
of
the
director
of
police
serafini
in
ravenna
who
had
heard
that
a
notorious
murderer
had
threatened
to
shoot
him
serafini
had
the
assassin
brought
to
him
gave
him
a
loaded
pistol
and
invited
him
to
shoot
the
murderer
grew
pale
and
serafini
boxed
his
ears
and
kicked
him
out
section
just
a
few
words
about
the
considerable
danger
in
the
testimony
presented
by
persons
of
education
altogether
uneducated
people
warn
us
in
their
own
way
but
people
who
have
a
certain
amount
of
training
in
at
least
one
direction
impress
us
to
such
a
degree
that
we
assume
them
to
be
otherwise
also
educated
and
thus
get
involved
in
mistakes
it
is
hard
to
say
correctly
what
constitutes
an
educated
man
we
demand
of
course
a
certain
amount
of
knowledge
but
we
do
not
know
the
magnitude
of
that
amount
of
knowledge
and
still
less
its
subject
matter
it
is
remarkable
that
our
time
which
has
devoted
itself
more
than
all
others
to
natural
science
does
not
include
knowledge
of
such
science
in
its
concept
of
the
educated
man
some
ignorance
of
history
or
of
the
classics
or
even
of
some
modern
novels
failure
to
visit
the
theaters
and
the
picture
exhibitions
neglect
of
french
and
english
classifies
a
man
at
once
as
lacking
essential
but
if
he
knows
these
things
and
at
the
same
time
exhibits
in
the
most
na√Øve
way
an
incredible
ignorance
of
zo√∂logy
botany
physics
chemistry
astronomy
he
still
remains
educated
the
contradiction
is
inexplicable
but
it
exists
and
because
of
it
nobody
can
definitely
say
what
is
meant
by
a
education
the
extent
of
is
however
illustrated
by
many
examples
we
mention
only
two
own
drawings
with
remarks
by
afzelius
show
that
in
spite
of
his
extraordinary
knowledge
of
botany
and
his
wonderful
memory
he
did
not
know
a
foreign
language
he
was
in
holland
for
three
years
and
failed
to
understand
even
the
dutch
language
so
very
similar
to
his
own
it
is
told
of
sir
humphrey
davy
that
during
the
visit
to
the
louvre
in
paris
he
admired
the
extraordinary
carving
of
the
frames
of
the
pictures
and
the
splendid
material
of
which
the
most
famous
of
the
greek
sculptures
were
made
now
how
are
we
to
meet
people
of
this
kind
when
they
are
on
the
witness
stand
they
offer
no
difficulty
when
they
tell
us
that
they
know
nothing
about
the
subject
in
question
suppose
we
have
to
interrogate
a
philologist
on
a
subject
which
requires
only
that
amount
of
knowledge
of
natural
science
which
may
be
presupposed
in
any
generally
educated
individual
if
he
declares
honestly
that
he
has
forgotten
everything
he
had
learned
about
the
matter
in
college
he
is
easily
dealt
with
in
the
same
way
as
if
however
he
is
not
honest
enough
immediately
to
confess
his
ignorance
nothing
else
will
do
except
to
make
him
see
his
position
by
means
of
questions
and
even
then
to
proceed
carefully
it
would
be
conscienceless
to
try
to
spare
this
man
while
another
is
shown
up
the
same
attitude
must
be
taken
toward
autodidacts
and
dilettantes
who
always
measure
the
value
of
their
knowledge
by
the
amount
of
effort
they
had
to
use
in
getting
it
and
hence
always
overestimate
their
acquirements
it
is
to
be
observed
that
they
assert
no
more
than
their
information
permits
them
to
and
their
personality
is
easily
discoverable
by
the
manner
in
which
they
present
their
knowledge
the
man
is
in
the
end
only
the
parvenu
of
knowledge
and
just
as
the
parvenu
as
such
rarely
conceals
his
character
so
the
autodidact
rarely
conceals
his
character
there
is
an
additional
quality
of
which
we
must
beware
that
is
the
tendency
of
experts
to
take
pride
in
some
different
incidental
and
less
important
little
thing
than
their
own
subject
frederick
the
great
with
his
miserable
is
an
example
such
people
may
easily
cause
mistakes
the
knowledge
of
their
attainment
in
one
field
causes
us
involuntarily
to
respect
their
assertions
now
if
their
assertions
deal
with
their
hobbies
many
a
silly
thing
is
taken
at
its
face
value
and
that
value
is
counterfeit
section
whether
a
scientific
characterization
of
inclination
is
possible
whether
the
limits
of
this
concept
can
be
determined
and
whether
it
is
the
result
of
nature
culture
or
both
together
are
questions
which
can
receive
no
certain
answer
we
shall
not
here
speak
of
individual
forms
of
inclination
to
drink
to
gamble
to
steal
for
these
are
comparatively
the
most
difficult
of
our
modern
problems
we
shall
consider
them
generally
and
briefly
trees
and
men
says
the
old
proverb
fall
as
they
are
inclined
now
if
we
examine
the
inclination
of
the
countless
fallen
ones
we
meet
in
our
calling
we
shall
have
fewer
difficulties
in
qualifying
and
judging
their
crimes
as
a
rule
it
is
difficult
to
separate
inclination
on
the
one
hand
from
opportunity
need
desire
on
the
other
the
capacity
for
evil
is
a
seduction
to
its
performance
as
alfieri
says
somewhere
and
this
idea
clarifies
the
status
of
inclination
the
ability
may
often
be
the
opportune
cause
of
the
development
of
an
evil
tendency
and
frequent
success
may
lead
to
the
assumption
of
the
presence
of
an
inclination
maudsley
points
out
that
feelings
that
have
once
been
present
leave
their
unconscious
residua
which
modify
the
total
character
and
even
reconstruct
the
moral
sense
as
a
resultant
of
particular
experiences
that
an
inclination
or
something
similar
thereto
might
develop
in
this
way
is
certain
for
we
may
even
inherit
an
inclination
but
only
under
certain
conditions
this
fact
is
substantiated
by
the
characteristics
of
vagabonds
it
may
perhaps
be
said
that
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
of
vagabondage
belongs
to
the
most
interesting
of
the
psychological
researches
of
the
criminal
judge
even
the
difference
between
the
real
bona
fide
tramp
and
the
poor
devil
who
in
spite
of
all
his
effort
can
get
no
work
requires
the
consideration
of
a
good
deal
of
psychological
fact
there
is
no
need
of
description
in
such
cases
the
difference
must
be
determined
by
the
study
of
thousands
of
details
just
as
interesting
are
the
results
of
procedure
especially
certain
statistical
results
the
course
of
long
practice
will
show
that
among
real
tramps
there
is
hardly
ever
an
individual
whose
calling
requires
very
hard
or
difficult
work
peasants
smiths
mountaineers
are
rarely
tramps
the
largest
numbers
have
trades
which
demand
no
real
hard
work
and
whose
business
is
not
uniform
bakers
millers
waiters
are
hence
more
numerous
the
first
have
comparatively
even
distribution
of
work
and
rest
the
latter
sometimes
have
much
sometimes
little
to
do
without
any
possible
evenness
of
distribution
now
we
should
make
a
mistake
if
we
inferred
that
because
the
former
had
hard
work
and
an
equivalent
distribution
of
work
and
rest
they
do
not
become
tramps
while
the
latter
lacking
these
do
become
tramps
in
truth
the
former
have
naturally
a
need
and
inclination
for
hard
work
and
uniform
living
have
therefore
no
inclination
to
tramping
and
have
for
that
reason
chosen
their
difficult
calling
the
latter
on
the
other
hand
felt
an
inclination
for
lighter
more
irregular
work
were
already
possessed
of
an
inclination
for
vagabondage
and
had
hence
chosen
the
business
of
baking
grinding
or
waiting
the
real
tramp
therefore
is
not
a
criminal
vagabondage
is
no
doubt
the
kindergarten
of
criminals
because
there
are
many
criminals
among
tramps
but
the
true
vagabond
is
one
only
because
of
his
inclination
for
tramping
he
is
a
degenerate
possibly
a
similar
account
of
other
types
may
be
rendered
if
it
is
attained
by
means
of
a
statistic
developed
on
fundamental
psychological
principles
it
would
give
us
ground
for
a
number
of
important
assumptions
it
would
help
us
to
make
parallel
inferences
inasmuch
as
it
would
permit
us
to
determine
the
fundamental
inclination
of
the
person
by
considering
his
calling
his
way
of
approaching
his
work
his
environment
his
choice
of
a
wife
his
preferred
pleasures
etc
and
then
we
should
be
able
to
connect
this
inclination
with
the
deed
in
question
it
is
difficult
to
fix
upon
the
relation
between
inclination
and
character
and
the
agreement
will
be
only
general
when
a
character
is
called
all
those
things
to
which
he
is
naturally
or
by
education
inclined
but
it
is
certain
that
a
good
or
bad
character
exists
only
then
when
its
maxims
of
desire
and
action
express
themselves
in
fact
the
emphasis
must
be
on
the
fact
what
is
factual
may
be
discovered
and
these
discoveries
may
be
of
use
section
the
ancient
classification
of
individuals
according
to
temperaments
is
of
little
use
there
were
four
of
them
called
humors
and
a
series
of
characteristics
was
assigned
to
each
but
not
one
of
them
had
all
of
its
characteristics
at
once
hence
temperaments
determined
according
to
these
four
categories
do
not
really
exist
and
the
categorical
distinction
can
have
no
practical
value
if
however
we
make
use
of
the
significant
general
meaning
of
temperament
the
apparatus
of
circumstance
which
is
connected
with
this
distinction
becomes
superfluous
if
you
call
every
active
person
choleric
every
truculent
one
sanguine
every
thoughtful
one
phlegmatic
and
every
sad
one
melancholy
you
simply
add
a
technical
expression
to
a
few
of
the
thousands
of
adjectives
that
describe
these
things
these
four
forms
are
not
the
only
ones
there
are
apart
from
countless
medial
and
transitional
forms
there
are
still
large
numbers
that
do
not
fit
in
any
one
of
these
categories
moreover
temperament
alters
with
age
health
experience
and
other
accidents
so
that
the
differentiation
is
not
even
justified
by
the
constancy
of
the
phenomenon
nevertheless
it
is
to
some
degree
significant
because
any
form
of
it
indicates
a
certain
authority
and
because
each
one
of
these
four
categories
serves
to
connect
a
series
of
phenomena
and
assumes
this
connection
to
be
indubitable
although
there
is
absolutely
no
necessity
for
it
when
machiavelli
says
that
the
world
belongs
to
the
phlegmatic
he
certainly
did
not
have
in
mind
that
complex
of
phenomena
which
are
habitually
understood
as
the
characteristics
of
the
phlegmatic
humor
he
wanted
simply
to
say
that
extremes
of
conduct
lead
to
as
little
in
the
daily
life
as
in
politics
that
everything
must
be
reflected
upon
and
repeatedly
tested
before
its
realization
is
attempted
that
only
then
can
progress
even
if
slow
be
made
if
he
had
said
the
world
belongs
to
the
cautious
or
reflective
person
we
should
not
have
found
his
meaning
to
be
different
when
we
seek
clearly
to
understand
the
nature
and
culture
of
an
individual
an
investigation
into
his
temperament
does
not
help
us
in
the
least
let
us
consider
then
some
other
characteristic
on
which
is
based
the
judgment
of
individuals
the
proverb
says
that
laughter
betrays
a
man
if
in
the
theater
you
know
the
subject
of
laughter
the
manner
of
laughter
and
the
point
at
which
laughter
first
occurred
you
know
where
the
most
educated
and
the
least
educated
people
are
schopenhauer
says
that
the
intelligent
man
finds
everything
funny
the
logical
man
nothing
and
according
to
erdmann
in
√ºber
die
dummheit
the
distressing
or
laughable
characteristics
of
an
object
shows
not
its
nature
but
the
nature
of
the
observer
it
would
seem
that
the
criminalist
might
save
himself
much
work
by
observing
the
laughter
of
his
subjects
the
embarrassed
foolish
snickering
of
the
badly
observing
witness
the
painful
smile
of
the
innocent
prisoner
or
the
convicted
penitent
the
cruel
laughter
of
the
witness
glad
of
the
damage
he
has
done
the
evil
laughter
of
the
condemning
accomplice
the
happy
weak
laughter
of
the
innocent
who
has
adduced
evidence
of
his
innocence
and
the
countless
other
forms
of
laughter
all
these
vary
so
much
with
the
character
of
the
laugher
and
are
so
significant
that
hardly
anything
compares
with
them
in
value
when
you
remember
moreover
that
concealment
during
laughter
is
not
easy
at
least
at
the
moment
when
the
laughter
ceases
you
see
how
very
important
laughter
may
be
in
determining
a
case
of
equal
importance
with
laughter
are
certain
changes
which
may
occur
in
people
during
a
very
short
time
if
we
observe
in
the
course
of
the
daily
life
that
people
without
any
apparent
reason
so
change
that
we
can
hardly
recognize
them
the
change
becomes
ten
times
more
intense
under
the
influence
of
guilt
or
even
of
imprisonment
somebody
said
that
isolation
has
revealed
the
greatest
men
the
greatest
fools
and
the
greatest
criminals
what
then
might
be
the
influence
of
compulsory
isolation
of
imprisonment
we
fortunately
do
not
live
in
a
time
which
permits
imprisonment
for
months
and
years
in
even
the
simplest
cases
but
under
certain
circumstances
even
a
few
imprisonment
may
completely
alter
a
person
embitterment
or
wildness
may
exhibit
itself
just
as
sorrow
and
softness
during
the
stay
under
arrest
and
hence
the
criminalist
who
does
not
frequently
see
and
deal
with
his
subjects
does
not
perform
his
duty
i
do
not
mean
of
course
that
he
should
see
them
for
the
purpose
of
getting
a
confession
out
of
an
attack
of
morbidity
i
mean
only
that
this
is
the
one
way
of
getting
a
just
and
correct
notion
of
the
case
every
criminalist
of
experience
will
grant
that
he
sees
the
event
particularly
the
motives
of
the
criminal
otherwise
after
the
first
examination
than
after
the
later
ones
and
that
his
later
notions
are
mainly
the
more
correct
ones
if
we
set
aside
the
unfortunate
cases
in
which
the
individual
held
for
examination
is
instructed
by
his
and
becomes
still
more
spoiled
i
might
permit
myself
the
assertion
that
imprisonment
tends
to
show
the
individual
more
correctly
as
he
is
that
the
strange
surroundings
the
change
from
his
former
position
the
opportunity
to
think
over
his
situation
may
if
there
are
no
opposing
influences
help
the
criminalist
a
great
deal
and
this
fact
is
confirmed
in
the
superior
results
of
later
to
earlier
examinations
in
addition
the
bodily
condition
and
the
health
of
the
prisoner
change
almost
always
the
new
mode
of
life
the
different
food
and
surroundings
the
lack
of
movement
the
moral
effect
work
directly
on
the
body
and
we
must
confess
unfortunately
on
health
there
are
however
cases
in
which
health
has
been
improved
by
imprisonment
especially
the
health
of
people
who
have
led
a
wild
irregular
drunken
life
or
such
who
have
had
to
worry
and
care
too
much
but
these
are
exceptions
and
as
a
rule
the
physique
suffers
a
great
deal
but
fortunately
for
a
short
time
only
the
influence
of
such
effects
on
the
mind
is
familiar
the
bodily
misfortune
gives
a
wide
opening
for
complete
change
in
moral
nature
health
sustains
the
atheist
in
darkness
this
fact
as
mentioned
by
bain
may
serve
to
explain
the
origin
of
many
a
confession
which
has
saved
an
innocent
person
at
the
last
moment
nor
must
we
forget
that
time
and
for
the
prisoner
imprisonment
is
time
endowed
with
power
effects
many
an
adjustment
of
extremes
we
know
that
utter
evil
is
as
rare
as
perfect
virtue
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
latter
but
we
almost
as
infrequently
meet
the
former
the
longer
we
deal
with
men
the
more
inclined
are
we
to
see
the
very
summit
of
devilment
as
the
result
of
need
and
friendlessness
weakness
foolishness
flightiness
and
just
simple
real
human
poorness
of
spirit
now
what
we
find
so
redistributed
in
the
course
of
years
we
often
find
crushed
together
and
fallen
apart
in
a
short
time
today
the
prisoner
seems
to
us
the
most
dreadful
criminal
in
a
few
days
we
have
calmed
down
have
learned
to
know
the
case
from
another
side
the
criminal
has
shown
his
real
nature
more
clearly
and
our
whole
notion
of
him
has
changed
i
frequently
think
of
the
simple
story
of
charles
sudden
entry
into
dresden
the
city
fathers
immediately
called
an
extraordinary
session
for
the
next
day
in
order
to
discuss
as
the
swedish
king
supposed
what
they
should
have
done
the
day
before
every
examined
prisoner
does
the
same
thing
when
he
leaves
the
court
he
is
already
thinking
of
what
he
should
have
said
differently
and
he
repeats
his
reflections
until
the
next
examination
hence
his
frequently
almost
inexplicable
variety
of
statements
and
hence
also
the
need
of
frequent
examination
finally
there
is
the
fact
mittermaier
has
pointed
to
the
importance
of
the
own
culture
and
character
a
girl
testifies
for
her
lover
and
against
her
brother
the
question
in
judgment
arises
which
voice
is
the
more
powerful
the
judge
will
not
easily
be
able
to
divorce
this
standard
of
judgment
from
himself
and
his
own
view
of
this
is
a
frequent
occurrence
you
consider
a
difficult
psychological
case
in
all
its
aspects
and
suddenly
without
knowing
how
or
why
you
have
found
its
solution
must
have
been
so
and
not
otherwise
he
has
acted
so
and
so
for
this
reason
a
close
examination
of
such
a
definite
inference
will
convince
you
that
it
is
due
to
the
pathetic
fallacy
you
have
so
inferred
because
you
would
have
done
so
thought
and
desired
so
under
similar
circumstances
the
commission
of
the
pathetic
fallacy
is
the
greatest
danger
section
and
the
three
enemies
of
the
criminalist
are
evil
nature
untruth
and
stupidity
or
foolishness
the
last
is
not
the
least
difficult
nobody
is
safe
from
its
attacks
it
appears
as
the
characteristic
of
mankind
in
general
in
their
prejudices
their
preconceptions
their
selfishness
and
their
nature
the
criminalist
has
to
fight
it
in
witnesses
in
jurymen
and
frequently
in
the
obstinacy
and
amusing
of
his
superiors
it
hinders
him
in
the
heads
of
his
colleagues
and
of
the
defendant
and
it
is
his
enemy
not
least
frequently
in
his
own
head
the
greatest
foolishness
is
to
believe
that
you
are
not
yourself
guilty
of
foolishness
the
cleverest
people
do
the
most
idiotic
things
he
makes
the
most
progress
who
keeps
in
mind
the
great
series
of
his
own
stupidities
and
tries
to
learn
from
them
one
can
only
console
oneself
with
the
belief
that
nobody
else
is
better
off
and
that
every
stupidity
is
a
basis
for
knowledge
the
world
is
such
that
every
foolishness
gets
somebody
to
commit
it
foolishness
is
an
isolated
property
it
is
not
related
to
intelligence
as
cold
to
warmth
cold
is
the
absence
of
heat
but
foolishness
is
not
the
absence
of
intelligence
both
are
properties
that
look
in
the
same
direction
hence
it
is
never
possible
to
speak
of
intelligence
or
stupidity
by
itself
whoever
deals
with
one
deals
with
the
other
but
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
conceive
them
as
a
developing
series
at
one
end
of
which
is
intelligence
and
at
the
other
stupidity
the
transition
is
not
only
frequent
but
there
are
many
remarkable
cases
in
which
one
passes
into
the
other
gets
mixed
up
with
it
and
covers
it
hence
a
thing
may
often
be
at
one
and
the
same
time
intelligent
and
stupid
intelligent
in
one
direction
and
stupid
in
another
and
it
is
not
incorrect
therefore
to
speak
of
clever
stupidities
and
of
clever
deeds
that
are
heartily
foolish
the
importance
of
stupidity
is
due
not
only
to
the
fact
that
it
may
lead
to
important
consequences
but
also
to
the
difficulty
of
discovering
it
in
certain
cases
it
is
before
all
things
correct
that
foolish
people
often
seem
to
be
very
wise
and
that
as
a
rule
much
intercourse
alone
is
able
to
reveal
the
complete
profundity
of
a
foolishness
but
in
our
work
we
can
have
little
intercourse
with
the
people
whom
we
are
to
know
and
there
are
indeed
persons
whom
we
take
to
be
foolish
at
the
first
encounter
and
who
really
are
so
when
we
know
them
better
and
even
when
we
have
learned
the
kind
and
degree
of
a
foolishness
we
have
not
learned
his
way
of
expressing
it
and
that
discovery
requires
much
wisdom
moreover
an
incredible
amount
of
effort
persistence
and
slyness
is
often
made
use
of
for
the
purpose
of
committing
an
immense
act
of
foolishness
every
one
of
us
knows
of
a
number
of
criminal
cases
that
remained
unexplained
for
a
long
time
simply
because
some
one
related
event
could
be
explained
by
a
stupidity
so
great
as
to
be
unbelievable
yet
the
knowledge
that
such
stupidity
actually
exists
could
explain
many
a
similar
matter
simply
and
easily
this
is
especially
true
with
regard
to
the
much
discussed
great
stupidity
which
the
criminal
commits
in
almost
every
crime
assume
that
such
a
stupidity
is
impossible
and
the
explanation
of
the
case
is
also
impossible
we
must
never
forget
that
it
is
exactly
the
wise
who
refuse
to
think
of
the
possibility
of
foolishness
just
as
everything
is
clean
to
the
cleanly
and
everything
is
philosophic
to
the
philosopher
everything
is
wise
to
the
wise
hence
he
finds
it
unintelligible
that
a
thing
may
be
explained
from
the
point
of
view
of
pure
unreason
his
duty
therefore
is
to
learn
as
much
and
as
accurately
as
possible
about
the
nature
of
foolishness
there
are
perhaps
few
books
on
earth
that
contain
so
many
clever
things
as
little
text
√ºber
die
dummheit
erdmann
starts
with
small
experiences
for
example
he
once
came
early
to
the
hamburg
railway
station
and
found
in
the
one
family
with
many
children
from
whose
conversation
he
learned
that
they
were
going
to
visit
a
grandfather
in
kyritz
the
station
filled
up
to
the
increasing
fear
of
the
smallest
member
of
the
family
a
boy
when
the
station
grew
quite
full
he
suddenly
broke
out
here
what
do
all
these
people
want
of
grandfather
in
the
child
supposed
that
because
he
himself
was
travelling
to
kyritz
all
other
people
in
the
same
place
could
have
had
no
different
intention
this
narrowness
of
the
point
of
view
the
generalization
of
own
petty
standpoint
into
a
rule
of
conduct
for
mankind
is
according
to
erdmann
the
essence
of
foolishness
how
far
one
may
go
in
this
process
without
appearing
foolish
may
be
seen
from
another
example
when
in
the
sixties
a
stranger
in
paris
spoke
admiringly
of
the
old
trees
on
a
certain
avenue
it
was
the
habit
of
the
parisians
to
answer
you
also
do
not
agree
with
haussmann
because
everybody
knew
about
the
attempt
by
the
parisian
prefect
baron
haussmann
to
beautify
paris
by
killing
trees
if
however
the
trees
in
the
churchyard
of
the
little
village
are
praised
and
the
native
peasant
replies
you
know
also
that
our
smith
wants
to
have
the
trees
chopped
down
the
remark
is
foolish
because
the
peasant
had
no
right
to
assume
that
the
world
knows
of
the
intentions
of
the
village
mayor
now
if
you
decrease
the
number
of
and
narrow
the
horizon
you
reach
a
point
where
the
circumference
of
ideas
is
identical
with
their
center
and
this
point
is
the
kernel
of
stupidity
the
idiot
stupidity
is
the
state
of
mind
in
which
a
man
judges
everything
by
himself
this
again
may
be
best
illustrated
by
a
figure
of
speech
if
you
go
about
a
room
and
observe
its
contents
you
soon
notice
how
the
objects
change
place
and
appearance
with
the
change
in
your
point
of
view
if
you
look
through
the
you
do
not
however
recognize
that
fact
everything
seems
equal
the
idiot
is
he
whose
egoistic
eye
is
the
only
through
which
he
looks
into
the
decorated
parlor
we
call
the
world
hence
the
defective
individual
born√©
who
has
real
narrowness
of
mind
possesses
only
a
small
number
of
ideas
and
points
of
view
and
hence
his
outlook
is
restricted
and
narrow
the
narrower
his
outlook
the
more
foolish
the
man
foolishness
and
egoism
are
privileges
of
the
child
we
are
all
born
foolish
and
raw
only
light
sharpens
our
wits
but
as
the
process
is
very
slow
there
is
not
one
of
us
who
has
not
some
blunt
edges
to
distinguish
objects
is
to
be
clever
to
confound
them
to
be
foolish
what
one
first
notices
in
defective
minds
is
the
unconditional
universality
of
their
remarks
the
generalizations
of
stupid
people
are
then
unjustly
called
exaggerations
where
they
say
the
clever
will
say
or
three
the
foolish
man
interrupts
his
fellow
because
he
presses
to
the
front
as
the
only
justified
speaker
what
is
most
characteristic
of
him
is
his
attempt
to
set
his
ego
in
the
foreground
do
this
always
is
one
of
my
traits
do
this
thing
in
quite
another
indeed
every
high
grade
of
foolishness
exhibits
a
certain
amount
of
force
which
the
fool
in
question
uses
to
bring
his
personality
forward
if
he
speaks
about
reaching
the
north
pole
he
says
course
i
have
never
been
at
the
north
pole
but
i
have
been
at
annotook
and
when
the
subject
of
conversation
is
some
great
invention
he
assures
us
that
he
has
not
invented
anything
but
that
he
is
able
to
make
brooms
and
incidentally
he
finds
fault
with
the
invention
and
the
more
foolish
he
is
the
more
fault
he
finds
these
characteristics
must
of
course
be
kept
apart
and
foolishness
must
not
be
confused
with
related
qualities
although
its
extent
or
boundaries
must
not
be
fixed
too
absolutely
kraus
distinguishes
between
the
idiot
the
fool
the
the
and
assigns
to
each
distinguishing
but
as
the
notions
for
which
these
expressions
stand
vary
very
much
this
classification
is
hardly
justified
a
fool
in
one
country
is
different
from
a
fool
in
another
an
idiot
in
the
south
from
an
idiot
in
the
north
and
even
when
various
individuals
have
to
be
classified
at
the
same
place
and
at
the
same
time
each
appears
to
be
somewhat
unique
if
for
example
we
take
definitions
of
the
idiot
as
one
who
is
least
concerned
with
causal
relations
who
understands
them
least
and
who
can
not
even
grasp
the
concept
of
causation
we
may
say
the
same
thing
about
the
the
untalented
etc
kant
says
rightly
that
inasmuch
as
fools
are
commonly
and
deserve
to
be
degraded
the
word
foolishness
must
be
applied
to
a
simpleton
and
not
to
a
good
and
honest
simpleton
but
kant
is
not
here
distinguishing
between
foolishness
and
simplicity
but
between
pretentiousness
and
kindly
honesty
thus
indicating
the
former
as
the
necessary
attribute
of
foolishness
another
mode
of
distinction
is
to
observe
that
forgetfulness
is
a
quality
of
the
simpleton
who
is
defective
in
attention
but
not
of
the
fool
who
has
only
a
narrow
outlook
whether
or
not
this
is
true
is
hard
to
say
there
is
still
another
differentiation
in
which
foolishness
and
simplicity
are
distinguished
by
the
lack
of
extent
or
the
intensity
of
attention
it
is
just
as
difficult
to
determine
what
we
mean
by
na√Øvet√©
and
how
to
distinguish
that
from
foolishness
that
the
concepts
nowhere
coincide
is
indubitable
the
contact
appears
only
where
one
is
uncertain
whether
a
thing
is
foolish
or
na√Øve
the
real
fool
is
never
na√Øve
for
foolishness
has
a
certain
laziness
of
thought
which
is
never
a
characteristic
of
na√Øvet√©
the
great
difficulty
of
getting
at
the
difference
is
most
evident
in
the
cases
of
real
and
artificial
na√Øvet√©
many
people
make
use
of
the
latter
with
great
success
to
do
so
requires
the
appearance
of
sufficient
foolishness
to
make
the
real
simpleton
believe
that
he
is
the
cleverer
of
the
pair
if
the
simpleton
believes
the
mummer
has
won
the
game
but
he
has
not
simulated
real
foolishness
he
has
simulated
na√Øvet√©
kant
defines
na√Øvet√©
as
conduct
which
pays
no
attention
to
the
possible
judgment
of
other
people
this
is
not
the
modern
notion
of
na√Øvet√©
for
nowadays
we
call
na√Øvet√©
an
uncritical
attitude
toward
environment
and
its
importance
in
our
profession
is
perhaps
due
to
the
fact
that
pardon
me
many
of
us
practise
it
naturalness
openness
of
heart
lovable
simplicity
openness
of
mind
and
whatever
else
the
efflorescence
of
na√Øvet√©
may
be
called
are
fascinating
qualities
in
children
and
girls
but
they
do
not
become
the
criminal
judge
it
is
na√Øve
honestly
to
accept
the
most
obvious
denials
of
defendant
and
witness
it
is
na√Øve
not
to
know
how
the
examinees
correspond
with
each
other
it
is
na√Øve
to
permit
a
criminal
to
talk
patter
with
another
in
your
own
hearing
it
is
still
more
na√Øve
to
speak
cordially
with
a
criminal
in
this
patter
it
is
na√Øve
not
to
know
the
simplest
expressions
of
this
patter
and
it
is
most
na√Øve
to
believe
that
the
criminal
can
discover
his
duty
by
means
of
the
statutes
their
exposition
and
explanation
it
is
na√Øve
to
attempt
to
impose
on
a
criminal
by
a
bald
exhibition
of
slyness
and
it
is
most
na√Øve
of
all
not
to
recognize
the
na√Øvet√©
of
the
criminal
a
criminalist
who
studies
himself
will
recognize
how
frequently
he
was
na√Øve
through
ignorance
of
the
importance
of
apparently
insignificant
circumstances
greatest
wisdom
says
la
rochefoucauld
in
knowing
the
values
of
but
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
attempt
always
to
bring
out
directly
that
alone
which
appears
to
be
hidden
behind
the
na√Øve
moment
the
will
does
not
think
but
it
must
turn
the
attention
of
the
mind
to
knowledge
it
can
not
will
any
particular
result
of
knowledge
it
can
only
will
that
the
mind
shall
investigate
without
prejudice
the
proper
use
of
this
good
will
will
consist
in
trying
to
find
out
the
quantity
of
intelligence
and
stupidity
which
may
be
taken
for
granted
in
the
interlocutor
i
have
once
shown
that
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
suppose
the
criminal
more
foolish
than
oneself
but
that
one
is
not
compelled
to
suppose
him
to
be
more
intelligent
than
oneself
until
one
can
gain
more
definite
knowledge
of
his
nature
it
is
best
to
believe
him
to
be
just
as
intelligent
as
oneself
this
will
involve
a
mistake
but
rarely
a
damaging
one
otherwise
one
may
hit
on
the
correct
solution
by
accident
in
some
cases
and
make
great
mistakes
in
all
others
intelligence
in
the
sense
of
wisdom
is
the
important
quality
in
our
interlocutor
the
witness
helps
us
with
it
and
the
defendant
deceives
and
eludes
us
by
its
means
according
to
kant
a
man
is
wise
when
he
has
the
power
of
practical
judgment
according
to
d√∂rner
certain
individuals
have
especial
intuitive
talents
others
have
capacity
for
empirical
investigations
and
still
others
for
speculative
synthesis
in
the
former
their
capacity
serves
to
render
the
object
clearly
to
observe
it
sharply
to
analyze
it
into
its
elements
in
the
latter
there
is
the
capacity
for
the
synthesis
for
the
discovery
of
relationships
again
we
hear
that
the
wise
head
invents
the
acute
mind
discovers
the
deep
mind
seeks
out
the
first
combines
the
second
analyzes
the
third
founds
wit
blends
sharpness
clarifies
deepness
illuminates
wit
persuades
sharpness
instructs
deepness
convinces
in
individual
cases
a
man
is
completely
and
suddenly
understood
perhaps
in
terms
of
the
following
proverb
are
two
kinds
of
silence
the
silence
of
the
fool
and
the
silence
of
the
wise
man
both
are
kant
says
somewhere
that
the
witty
person
is
free
and
pert
the
judicious
person
reflective
and
unwilling
to
draw
conclusions
in
a
certain
direction
we
may
be
helped
also
by
particular
evidences
so
when
hering
says
is
the
mother
of
virtuosity
the
work
of
the
spider
is
wonderful
but
the
spider
can
do
nothing
else
man
makes
a
bow
and
arrow
when
he
can
get
no
prey
in
his
net
the
spider
goes
this
distinguishes
mechanical
cleverness
from
conscious
wisdom
completely
of
the
same
illuminating
character
are
such
salse
dicta
as
fool
never
does
what
he
says
the
wise
man
never
says
what
he
can
fool
one
man
but
you
can
not
fool
all
is
natural
wisdom
is
a
product
of
depend
on
accident
is
foolishness
to
use
accident
is
are
stupidities
which
can
be
committed
only
by
the
is
as
different
from
foolishness
as
man
from
speak
what
wise
men
is
deficient
but
stupidity
never
etc
these
and
countless
other
help
us
considerably
in
individual
cases
but
give
us
no
general
characterization
of
the
function
of
wisdom
we
may
therefore
get
some
sort
of
pragmatic
insight
into
the
wisdom
or
unwisdom
of
an
action
in
the
assertion
be
wise
is
to
be
able
to
sacrifice
an
immediate
petty
advantage
to
a
later
and
greater
this
proposition
seems
not
to
have
sufficient
scope
but
on
closer
examination
seems
to
fit
all
cases
the
wise
man
lives
according
to
law
and
sacrifices
the
petty
advantage
of
immediate
sensual
pleasure
for
the
greater
advantage
of
sustained
health
he
is
prudent
and
sacrifices
the
immediate
petty
delights
to
the
advantage
of
a
carefree
age
he
is
cautious
in
his
speculation
and
sacrifices
momentary
doubtful
and
hence
petty
successes
to
the
greater
later
success
of
certain
earning
he
is
silent
and
sacrifices
the
petty
advantage
of
appearing
for
the
moment
about
all
possible
matters
to
the
greater
advantage
of
not
getting
into
trouble
on
account
of
this
he
commits
no
punishable
deeds
and
sacrifices
advantages
that
might
be
gained
for
the
moment
to
the
later
greater
advantage
of
not
being
punished
so
the
analysis
might
be
continued
and
in
each
case
we
should
find
that
there
was
no
wisdom
which
could
not
be
explained
in
this
way
the
use
of
our
explanatory
proposition
is
possible
in
all
cases
which
require
determining
the
real
or
apparent
participation
of
some
individual
in
a
crime
if
the
degree
of
wisdom
a
man
may
be
credited
with
can
be
determined
by
means
of
this
analysis
it
is
not
difficult
afterwards
to
test
by
its
use
the
probability
of
his
having
a
share
in
the
crime
in
question
finally
cases
are
again
and
again
observed
in
which
very
foolish
people
idiots
and
lunatics
either
because
of
anxiety
terror
wounds
in
the
head
or
shortly
before
death
become
intelligent
for
a
brief
period
it
is
conceivable
that
the
improvement
of
mental
activity
in
these
cases
arises
when
the
defect
has
depended
on
the
pathological
dominance
of
an
inhibitory
center
the
abnormally
intensified
activity
of
which
has
as
its
result
an
inhibition
of
other
important
centers
acute
curable
dementia
paranoia
a
light
transitory
actual
increase
of
mental
activity
might
possibly
be
explained
by
the
familiar
fact
that
cerebral
anemia
in
its
early
stages
is
exciting
rather
than
dulling
theoretically
this
might
be
connected
perhaps
with
the
molecular
which
are
involved
in
the
disintegration
of
the
brain
the
difference
between
the
effects
of
these
two
causes
will
hardly
be
great
but
testimony
dependent
on
this
altered
character
of
mental
activity
will
have
little
reliability
hallucinations
false
memories
melancholic
accusations
of
self
particularly
may
also
be
explained
in
terms
of
such
excitement
we
criminalists
have
frequently
to
deal
with
people
in
conditions
and
when
we
receive
intelligent
answers
from
them
we
must
never
set
them
aside
but
must
carefully
make
note
of
them
and
estimate
them
in
the
light
of
expert
advice
to
this
class
belongs
the
interesting
phenomenon
that
we
very
frequently
meet
fools
who
never
do
anything
foolish
it
is
not
true
that
these
are
simply
misjudged
and
only
appear
to
be
foolish
they
are
really
foolish
but
they
are
helped
by
certain
conditions
in
every
instance
of
their
conduct
to
begin
with
they
are
not
so
foolish
as
to
deceive
themselves
they
are
therefore
in
possession
of
a
certain
notion
of
their
own
weakness
and
do
not
attempt
things
which
are
too
much
for
them
then
they
must
have
a
certain
degree
of
luck
in
their
undertakings
the
proverb
says
that
conceit
is
the
force
behind
the
fool
and
if
these
fools
apply
their
conceit
to
appropriate
situations
they
succeed
then
again
they
sometimes
fail
to
see
dangers
and
are
therefore
free
from
swindles
which
are
dangerous
even
to
the
cleverest
persons
fool
stumbles
across
the
abyss
into
which
the
wise
man
regularly
tumbles
says
the
proverb
again
and
if
routine
may
properly
be
called
the
surrogate
of
talent
we
must
suppose
that
custom
and
practice
may
carry
the
biggest
fool
so
far
as
to
help
him
in
many
cases
to
success
according
to
esser
the
fool
thinks
in
terms
of
the
following
proposition
that
are
alike
in
a
few
points
are
identical
and
things
that
are
unlike
in
a
few
points
are
altogether
if
this
is
true
the
fool
can
fail
only
when
he
is
drawing
inferences
of
this
kind
if
however
none
of
the
important
events
in
his
life
involve
such
inferences
he
has
no
opportunity
to
exhibit
his
essential
foolishness
the
same
thing
is
true
of
his
interests
no
fool
has
a
real
eagerness
for
knowledge
he
has
instead
curiosity
and
this
can
never
be
distinguished
with
certainty
from
knowledge
now
if
the
fool
is
lucky
he
seems
to
be
moving
forward
shows
himself
possessed
of
interests
and
nobody
proves
that
this
possession
is
only
idiotic
curiosity
the
fool
must
protect
himself
against
one
thing
action
foolishness
in
action
is
rawness
true
rawness
is
always
foolish
and
can
not
be
mistaken
here
again
we
draw
the
extraordinary
conclusion
that
we
criminalists
as
in
all
other
cases
must
not
take
man
to
be
what
he
seems
most
of
the
time
but
what
he
shows
himself
as
in
exceptional
cases
the
worst
man
may
have
done
something
absolutely
good
the
greatest
liar
may
today
tell
the
truth
and
the
simpleton
may
today
act
wisely
we
are
not
concerned
with
man
as
such
what
is
important
for
us
is
his
immediate
the
rest
of
his
nature
is
a
matter
of
judgment
topic
isolated
influences
section
a
habit
habit
may
be
of
considerable
importance
in
criminal
law
we
have
first
of
all
to
know
how
far
we
ourselves
are
influenced
in
our
thinking
and
acting
by
habit
then
it
is
important
in
judging
the
testimony
of
witnesses
to
know
whether
and
how
far
the
witness
behaved
according
to
his
habits
for
by
means
of
this
knowledge
we
may
be
able
to
see
the
likelihood
of
many
a
thing
that
might
have
otherwise
seemed
improbable
finally
we
may
be
able
properly
to
estimate
many
an
excuse
offered
by
a
defendant
through
considering
his
habits
especially
when
we
are
dealing
with
events
that
are
supposed
to
have
occurred
under
stupefaction
absolute
intoxication
distraction
etc
hume
indeed
has
assigned
to
habit
the
maximum
of
significance
his
whole
system
depends
upon
the
use
of
habit
as
a
principle
of
explanation
he
shows
that
the
essence
of
all
our
inferences
with
regard
to
facts
relates
to
the
principle
of
causation
and
the
foundation
of
all
our
beliefs
in
causation
is
experience
while
the
foundation
of
inference
from
experience
is
habit
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
strange
how
often
an
obscure
event
becomes
suddenly
clear
by
an
inquiry
into
the
possibility
of
habit
as
its
cause
even
everything
we
call
fashion
custom
presumption
is
at
bottom
nothing
more
than
habit
or
explicable
by
habit
all
new
fashions
in
clothes
in
usages
are
disliked
until
one
becomes
habituated
to
them
and
custom
and
morality
must
attach
themselves
to
the
iron
law
of
habit
what
would
my
grandmother
have
said
of
a
woman
whom
she
might
have
seen
happily
bicycling
through
the
streets
how
every
german
citizen
crosses
himself
when
he
sees
french
and
if
we
had
no
idea
of
a
ball
among
the
four
hundred
what
should
we
say
if
we
heard
that
in
the
evening
men
meet
women
embrace
them
vigorously
pull
them
round
and
bob
and
stamp
through
the
hall
with
disgusting
noise
until
they
must
stop
pouring
perspiration
gasping
for
breath
but
because
we
are
accustomed
to
it
we
are
satisfied
with
it
to
see
what
influence
habit
has
on
our
views
of
this
subject
just
close
your
ears
tightly
at
some
ball
and
watch
the
dancers
as
soon
as
you
stop
hearing
the
music
you
think
you
are
in
a
lunatic
asylum
indeed
you
do
not
need
to
select
such
a
really
foolish
case
helmholtz
suggests
looking
at
a
man
walking
in
the
distance
through
the
large
end
of
a
telescope
what
extraordinary
humping
and
rocking
of
the
body
the
exhibits
there
are
any
number
of
such
examples
and
if
we
inquire
concerning
the
permissibility
of
certain
events
we
simply
carry
the
question
of
habit
into
the
field
of
conduct
hunting
harmless
animals
vivisection
the
execution
of
tricks
ballets
and
numerous
other
things
will
seem
to
us
shocking
inconceivable
disgusting
if
we
are
not
habituated
to
them
what
here
requires
thought
is
the
fact
that
we
criminalists
often
judge
situations
we
do
not
know
when
the
peasant
the
unskilled
laborer
or
the
craftsman
does
anything
we
know
only
superficially
the
nature
and
real
status
we
have
as
a
rule
no
knowledge
of
the
habits
and
when
we
regard
some
one
of
his
actions
as
most
reprehensible
quarrel
or
insult
or
maltreatment
of
his
wife
or
children
he
responds
to
us
with
a
most
astounded
expression
he
is
not
habituated
to
anything
else
and
we
do
not
teach
him
a
better
way
by
punishing
him
questions
of
this
sort
however
deal
with
the
generality
of
human
nature
and
do
not
directly
concern
us
but
directly
we
are
required
to
make
a
correct
judgment
of
testimony
concerning
habit
they
will
help
us
to
more
just
interpretations
and
will
reduce
the
number
of
crass
contradictions
this
is
so
because
many
an
assertion
will
seem
probable
when
the
witness
shows
that
the
thing
described
was
habitual
no
definite
boundary
can
be
drawn
between
skill
and
habit
and
we
may
perhaps
say
rightly
that
skill
is
possible
only
where
habit
exists
and
habit
is
present
where
a
certain
amount
of
skill
has
been
attained
skill
generally
is
the
capacity
of
speedy
habituation
but
a
distinction
must
be
drawn
habit
makes
actions
easy
habituation
makes
them
necessary
this
is
most
obvious
in
cases
of
bodily
skill
riding
swimming
skating
cycling
everything
in
which
habit
and
skill
can
not
be
separated
and
with
regard
to
which
we
can
not
see
why
we
and
other
untrained
people
can
not
immediately
do
the
same
thing
and
when
we
can
do
it
we
do
it
without
thinking
as
if
half
asleep
such
action
is
not
skilled
but
habitual
a
part
of
it
is
determined
by
the
body
itself
without
the
especial
guidance
of
the
mind
we
find
the
power
to
see
so
many
animals
tracks
inconceivable
when
we
have
once
properly
mastered
the
principle
of
a
quite
complicated
crystal
we
can
not
understand
why
we
had
not
done
so
before
we
feel
in
the
same
way
with
regard
to
an
unclear
drawing
a
new
road
some
bodily
activity
etc
anybody
who
has
not
acquired
the
habit
might
have
to
take
all
day
to
learn
the
business
of
dressing
and
undressing
himself
and
how
difficult
it
is
just
to
walk
a
thing
we
do
unconsciously
is
confirmed
by
the
mechanic
who
wants
to
construct
a
walking
figure
that
all
people
are
equally
subject
to
habit
is
not
asserted
the
thing
is
a
matter
of
disposition
in
the
sense
of
the
recurrence
of
past
ideas
or
tendencies
we
must
assume
that
an
inclination
evinced
by
idea
a
makes
possible
ideas
habits
may
develop
according
to
these
dispositions
but
the
knowledge
of
the
conditions
of
this
development
we
do
not
yet
possess
nevertheless
we
tend
to
assume
that
the
famous
historian
x
and
the
famous
countess
y
will
not
get
the
habit
of
drinking
or
but
in
this
case
our
assumption
is
deduced
from
their
circumstances
and
not
from
their
personality
hence
it
is
difficult
to
say
with
certainty
that
a
person
is
incapable
of
acquiring
this
or
that
habit
so
that
it
is
of
importance
when
the
question
arises
to
discover
the
existence
of
implied
habits
whenever
these
are
asserted
in
the
face
of
apparently
contradictory
conditions
there
is
a
certain
presumption
for
the
correctness
of
the
implication
when
the
practised
physician
asserts
that
he
counted
the
pulse
for
a
minute
without
a
watch
or
when
the
merchant
accurately
estimates
the
weight
of
goods
within
a
few
grams
etc
but
it
will
be
just
as
well
to
test
the
assertion
since
without
this
test
the
possibility
of
error
is
still
great
somebody
asserts
that
he
had
been
distracted
and
had
paid
no
attention
to
what
two
persons
close
to
him
had
said
suddenly
he
began
to
take
notice
and
found
himself
able
to
recapitulate
all
their
remarks
or
again
a
musician
who
is
almost
altogether
deaf
says
that
he
is
so
accustomed
to
music
that
in
spite
of
his
deafness
he
is
able
to
hear
the
smallest
discord
in
the
orchestra
yet
again
we
hear
of
insignificant
hardly
controllable
habits
that
become
accidentally
significant
in
a
criminal
case
thus
the
crime
of
arson
was
observed
by
the
neighbor
who
could
have
seen
the
action
through
the
window
only
if
he
had
leaned
far
out
of
it
when
he
was
asked
what
he
wanted
to
see
in
the
cold
winter
night
he
replied
that
he
had
the
habit
daily
of
spitting
out
of
the
window
just
before
going
to
bed
another
who
was
surprised
in
his
sleep
by
an
entering
thief
had
heavily
wounded
the
latter
with
a
great
brush
he
happened
to
have
had
it
in
his
the
happening
was
due
to
his
habit
of
being
unable
to
fall
asleep
without
a
brush
in
his
hand
if
such
habits
are
demonstrable
facts
they
serve
to
explain
otherwise
unexplainable
events
they
are
however
the
more
difficult
to
establish
because
they
occur
mainly
in
isolated
people
old
bachelors
and
old
maids
so
that
their
confirmation
by
others
is
rare
on
the
other
hand
every
one
of
us
knows
habits
of
his
own
or
of
his
friends
which
would
not
be
believed
when
cited
and
which
would
be
very
difficult
to
prove
when
the
need
arose
the
influence
of
habit
on
indifferent
matters
can
be
shown
by
numerous
examples
there
is
citation
that
if
anybody
happened
to
send
his
doctor
nine
ducats
the
latter
would
have
to
believe
that
the
messenger
had
stolen
the
tenth
if
you
give
a
bride
most
beautiful
linen
but
only
eleven
pieces
she
will
weep
give
her
thirteen
pieces
and
she
will
certainly
throw
one
of
them
away
if
you
keep
these
habits
in
mind
you
may
possibly
say
that
they
must
have
had
a
definite
determinative
and
alternative
influence
on
body
and
mind
for
example
from
time
immemorial
mankind
has
taken
medications
at
definite
intervals
every
hour
every
two
hours
etc
hence
a
powder
ordered
every
minutes
will
cause
us
complete
surprise
but
by
what
authority
does
the
body
require
exactly
these
quantities
of
time
or
weight
or
again
our
lectures
private
or
public
so
and
so
much
time
of
course
it
would
be
inconvenient
if
professors
lectured
only
minutes
yet
how
much
difficulty
must
not
the
mind
have
met
in
becoming
habituated
to
exactly
minutes
of
instruction
this
habituation
has
been
going
on
for
a
long
time
and
now
children
like
nations
regard
the
new
in
the
light
of
the
old
so
that
the
old
especially
when
it
is
fixed
by
language
becomes
the
instrument
for
the
control
of
the
new
indeed
we
often
stick
linguistically
to
old
things
although
they
have
been
long
superannuated
there
is
the
characteristic
state
of
mind
which
might
be
called
the
refraction
of
an
idea
by
the
presence
of
another
idea
an
example
is
the
habit
of
saying
as
i
have
before
beginning
a
speech
the
speaker
means
to
say
that
he
has
not
prepared
himself
but
as
he
really
has
prepared
himself
both
expressions
come
out
together
this
habitual
concurrence
of
the
real
thought
is
of
importance
and
offers
frequently
the
opportunity
of
correcting
what
is
said
by
what
is
thought
this
process
is
similar
to
that
in
which
a
gesture
contradicts
a
statement
we
often
hear
had
to
take
it
because
it
was
right
this
assertion
indicates
theft
through
need
and
at
the
same
time
theft
through
opportunity
or
again
we
hear
had
not
agreed
this
assertion
denies
agreement
and
can
indicate
merely
because
of
the
added
that
the
agreement
was
not
of
already
standing
still
again
we
hear
we
fell
to
the
floor
i
defended
myself
and
struck
down
at
here
what
is
asserted
is
and
what
is
admitted
is
that
the
enemy
was
underneath
the
speaker
such
refractions
of
thought
occur
frequently
and
are
very
important
particularly
in
witnesses
who
exaggerate
or
do
not
tell
the
whole
truth
they
are
however
rarely
noticed
because
they
require
accurate
observation
of
each
word
and
that
requires
time
and
our
time
has
no
time
section
b
heredity
however
important
the
question
of
heredity
may
be
to
lawyers
psychologically
its
application
to
legal
needs
is
impossible
it
would
require
on
the
one
hand
the
study
of
all
the
literature
concerning
it
together
with
the
particular
teachings
of
darwin
and
his
disciples
and
of
lombroso
and
his
the
study
of
it
has
not
yet
been
established
the
unfounded
adventurous
and
arbitrary
assertions
of
the
lombrosists
have
been
contradicted
especially
through
the
efforts
of
german
investigators
but
others
like
debierre
in
lille
sernoff
in
moscow
taine
drill
marchand
have
also
had
occasion
to
controvert
the
italian
positivists
at
the
same
time
the
problem
of
heredity
is
not
dead
and
will
not
die
this
is
being
shown
particularly
in
the
retort
of
marchand
concerning
the
examinations
he
made
with
koslow
in
the
asylum
for
juvenile
offenders
founded
by
the
petersburg
anthropological
society
between
buckle
who
absolutely
denies
heredity
and
the
latest
of
the
modern
doctrines
there
are
a
number
of
intermediate
views
one
of
which
may
possibly
be
true
there
is
an
enormous
literature
which
every
criminalist
should
study
nevertheless
this
literature
can
tell
us
nothing
about
the
legitimacy
of
the
premise
of
heredity
every
educated
man
still
believes
doctrines
and
the
new
theories
that
seek
to
emancipate
themselves
from
it
do
so
only
by
pushing
them
out
of
the
big
front
door
and
insinuating
them
through
the
little
back
door
but
according
to
darwinism
is
only
the
principle
of
the
hereditary
maintenance
of
the
variation
from
its
parents
everybody
knows
of
real
inherited
characters
and
many
examples
of
it
are
cited
according
to
ribot
suicide
is
hereditary
according
to
despine
kleptomania
according
to
lucas
vigorous
sexuality
according
to
darwin
etc
our
personal
acquaintances
show
the
inheritance
of
features
figure
habits
intellectual
properties
particularly
cleverness
such
as
sense
of
space
and
time
capacity
for
orientation
interests
diseases
etc
even
ideas
have
their
ancestors
like
men
and
we
learn
from
the
study
of
animals
how
instincts
capacities
even
acquired
ones
are
progressively
inherited
and
yet
we
refuse
to
believe
in
the
congenital
criminal
but
the
contradiction
is
only
apparent
a
study
of
the
works
of
darwin
weismann
devries
shows
us
indubitably
that
no
authority
asserts
the
inheritance
of
great
alterations
appearing
for
the
first
time
in
an
individual
and
as
to
the
inheritance
of
acquired
characteristics
some
authorities
assert
this
to
be
impossible
until
darwin
the
old
law
of
species
demanded
that
definite
traits
of
a
species
should
not
change
through
however
long
a
period
the
darwinian
principle
indicates
the
inheritance
of
minute
variations
intensified
by
sexual
selection
and
in
the
course
of
time
developed
into
great
variations
now
nobody
will
deny
that
the
real
criminal
is
different
from
the
majority
of
other
people
that
this
difference
is
great
and
essential
is
inferred
from
the
circumstance
that
a
habit
a
single
characteristic
an
unhappy
inclination
does
not
constitute
a
criminal
if
a
man
is
a
thief
it
will
not
be
asserted
that
he
is
otherwise
like
decent
people
varying
only
in
the
accidental
inclination
to
theft
we
know
that
besides
the
inclination
to
theft
we
may
assign
him
a
dislike
for
honest
work
lack
of
moral
power
indifference
to
the
laws
of
honor
when
caught
the
lack
of
real
religion
in
short
the
inclination
to
theft
must
be
combined
with
a
large
number
of
very
characteristic
qualities
in
order
to
make
a
thief
of
a
man
there
must
in
a
word
be
a
complete
and
profound
change
in
his
whole
nature
such
great
changes
in
the
individual
are
never
directly
inherited
only
particular
properties
can
be
inherited
but
these
do
not
constitute
a
criminal
hence
the
son
of
a
criminal
need
not
in
his
turn
be
a
criminal
this
does
not
imply
that
in
the
course
of
generations
characters
might
not
compound
themselves
until
a
criminal
type
is
developed
but
this
is
as
rare
as
the
development
of
new
species
among
the
animals
races
are
frequently
selected
species
develop
rarely
section
c
prepossession
prepossession
prejudice
and
anticipatory
opinion
are
perhaps
the
most
dangerous
foes
of
the
criminalist
it
is
believed
that
the
danger
from
them
is
not
great
since
in
most
cases
prepossession
controls
only
one
individual
and
a
criminal
case
is
dealt
with
by
several
but
this
proves
nothing
when
the
elegant
teacher
of
horseback
riding
has
performed
his
subtlest
tricks
he
gracefully
removes
his
hat
and
bows
to
the
public
and
only
at
that
moment
does
the
public
observe
that
it
has
been
seeing
something
remarkable
and
applauds
heartily
not
because
it
has
understood
the
difficulty
of
the
performance
but
because
the
rider
has
bowed
this
happens
to
us
however
good
our
will
one
man
has
a
case
in
hand
he
develops
it
and
if
at
the
proper
time
he
says
the
others
say
yes
and
he
may
have
been
led
by
a
prepossession
but
its
presence
is
now
no
longer
to
be
perceived
thus
though
our
assumptions
may
be
most
excellently
meant
we
still
must
grant
that
a
conviction
on
false
grounds
even
when
unconsciously
arrived
at
so
suffuses
a
mind
that
the
event
in
itself
can
no
longer
be
honestly
observed
to
have
no
prejudices
indicates
a
healthy
vigorous
mind
in
no
sense
that
is
indicated
by
the
power
to
set
aside
prejudices
as
soon
as
their
invalidity
is
demonstrated
now
this
demonstration
is
difficult
for
when
a
thing
is
recognized
as
a
prejudice
it
is
one
no
longer
i
have
elsewhere
under
the
heading
opinion
indicated
the
danger
to
which
the
examining
justice
is
subject
thereby
and
have
sought
to
show
how
even
a
false
idea
of
location
may
lead
to
a
prepossession
in
favor
of
a
certain
view
how
vigorous
the
influence
of
the
first
witness
is
inasmuch
as
we
easily
permit
ourselves
to
be
taken
in
by
the
earliest
information
and
later
on
lack
time
to
convince
ourselves
that
the
matter
may
not
be
as
our
earliest
advice
paints
it
hence
false
information
necessarily
conceals
a
danger
and
it
always
is
a
matter
of
effort
to
see
that
the
crime
is
a
fictitious
one
or
that
something
which
has
been
called
accident
may
conceal
a
crime
the
average
man
knows
this
well
and
after
a
brawl
after
contradictory
testimony
both
parties
hurry
to
be
beforehand
in
laying
the
information
whoever
lays
the
information
first
has
the
advantage
his
story
effects
a
prepossession
in
favor
of
his
view
and
it
requires
effort
to
accustom
oneself
to
the
opposite
view
and
later
it
is
difficult
to
reverse
the
r√¥les
of
witness
and
defendant
but
we
have
to
deal
with
prepossession
in
others
besides
ourself
in
witnesses
accused
experts
jury
colleagues
subordinates
etc
the
more
we
know
the
newer
new
things
seem
where
however
the
apperceptive
mass
is
hard
and
compact
the
inner
reconstruction
ceases
and
therewith
the
capacity
for
new
experiences
and
hence
we
get
those
judges
who
can
learn
nothing
and
forget
nothing
indefiniteness
in
the
apperceptive
masses
results
in
the
even
movement
of
apperception
minds
with
confused
ideational
complexes
hit
little
upon
the
particular
characteristic
of
presented
fact
and
find
everywhere
only
what
they
have
in
mind
the
of
apperception
frequently
contains
an
error
in
conception
in
most
cases
the
effective
influence
is
egoism
which
inclines
men
to
presuppose
their
own
experiences
views
and
principles
in
others
and
to
build
according
to
them
a
system
of
prepossessions
and
prejudices
to
apply
to
the
new
case
especially
dangerous
are
the
experiences
for
these
tend
to
lead
to
the
firm
conviction
that
the
present
case
can
in
no
sense
be
different
from
former
ones
if
anybody
has
been
at
work
on
such
earlier
similar
cases
he
tends
to
behave
now
as
then
his
behavior
at
that
time
sets
the
standard
for
the
present
and
whatever
differs
from
it
he
calls
false
even
though
the
similarity
between
the
two
cases
is
only
external
and
apparent
it
is
characteristic
of
egoism
that
it
causes
people
to
permit
themselves
to
be
bribed
by
being
met
the
inclination
and
favor
of
most
men
is
won
by
nothing
so
easily
and
completely
as
by
real
or
apparent
devotion
and
interest
if
this
is
done
at
all
cleverly
few
can
resist
it
and
the
prepossession
in
their
favor
is
complete
how
many
are
free
of
prejudice
against
ugly
deformed
stuttering
individuals
and
who
has
no
prejudice
in
favor
of
handsome
lovable
people
even
the
most
just
must
make
an
effort
so
to
meet
his
neighbor
as
to
be
without
prejudice
for
or
against
him
because
of
his
natural
endowment
behavior
and
little
pleasantnesses
are
almost
as
important
suppose
that
a
criminalist
has
worked
hard
all
morning
it
is
long
past
the
time
at
which
he
had
for
one
reason
or
another
hoped
to
get
home
and
just
as
he
is
putting
his
hat
on
his
head
along
comes
a
man
who
wants
to
lay
information
concerning
some
ancient
apparent
perjury
the
man
had
let
it
go
for
years
here
he
is
with
it
again
at
just
this
inconvenient
moment
he
has
come
a
long
distance
he
can
not
be
sent
away
his
case
moreover
seems
improbable
and
the
man
expresses
himself
with
difficulty
finally
when
the
protocol
is
made
it
appears
that
he
has
not
been
properly
understood
and
moreover
that
he
has
added
many
irrelevant
things
in
short
he
strains
patience
to
the
limit
now
i
should
like
to
know
the
criminalist
who
would
not
acquire
a
vigorous
prejudice
against
this
complainant
it
would
be
so
natural
that
nobody
would
blame
one
for
such
a
prejudice
at
the
same
time
it
is
proper
to
require
that
it
shall
be
only
transitive
and
that
later
when
the
feeling
has
calmed
everything
shall
be
handled
with
scrupulous
conscientiousness
so
as
to
repair
whatever
in
the
first
instance
might
have
been
harmed
it
is
neither
necessary
nor
possible
to
discuss
all
the
particular
forms
of
prepossession
there
is
the
unconditional
necessity
of
merely
making
a
thoroughly
careful
search
for
their
presence
if
any
indication
whatever
even
the
remotest
shows
its
likelihood
of
the
extremest
limit
of
possible
prejudice
names
may
serve
as
examples
it
sounds
funny
to
say
that
a
man
may
be
prejudiced
for
or
against
an
individual
by
the
sound
of
his
name
but
it
is
true
who
will
deny
that
he
has
been
inclined
to
favor
people
because
they
bore
a
beloved
name
and
who
has
not
heard
remarks
like
very
name
of
that
fellow
makes
me
i
remember
clearly
two
cases
in
one
patriz
sevenpounder
and
emmerenzia
hinterkofler
were
accused
of
swindling
and
my
first
notion
was
that
such
honorable
names
could
not
possibly
belong
to
people
guilty
of
swindling
the
opposite
case
was
one
in
which
a
deposition
concerning
some
attack
upon
him
was
signed
by
arthur
filgr√©
i
thought
at
first
that
the
whole
complaint
was
as
windy
as
the
name
again
i
know
that
one
man
did
not
get
the
job
of
private
secretary
he
was
looking
for
because
his
name
as
written
was
kilian
krautl
can
a
man
be
decent
who
has
such
a
foolish
name
said
his
employer
then
again
a
certain
augustinian
monk
who
was
a
favorite
in
a
large
city
owed
his
popularity
partly
to
his
rhythmical
cognomen
pater
peter

our
poets
know
right
well
the
importance
for
us
of
so
indifferent
a
thing
as
a
name
and
the
best
among
them
are
very
cautious
about
the
selection
and
composition
of
names
net
the
smallest
part
of
their
effects
lies
in
the
successful
tone
of
the
names
they
use
and
it
was
not
unjust
to
say
that
bismark
could
not
possibly
have
attained
his
position
if
he
had
been
called
maier
section
d
imitation
and
the
crowd
the
character
of
the
instinct
of
imitation
and
its
influence
on
the
crowd
has
long
been
studied
in
animals
children
and
even
men
and
has
been
recognized
as
a
fundamental
trait
of
intellect
and
the
prime
condition
of
all
education
later
on
its
influence
on
crowds
was
observed
and
napoleon
said
crimes
collectifs
weber
spoke
of
moral
contagion
and
it
has
long
been
known
that
suicide
is
contagious
baer
in
his
book
on
gef√§ngnisse
has
assigned
the
there
is
the
remarkable
fact
that
suicides
often
hang
themselves
on
trees
which
have
already
been
used
for
that
purpose
and
in
jails
it
is
frequently
observed
that
after
a
long
interval
a
series
of
suicides
suddenly
appear
the
repetition
of
crimes
once
one
has
been
committed
in
a
particular
way
is
also
frequent
among
them
the
crime
of
if
a
girl
has
stifled
her
child
ten
others
do
so
if
a
girl
has
sat
down
upon
it
or
has
choked
it
by
pressing
it
close
to
her
breast
there
are
others
to
do
likewise
tarde
believes
that
crime
is
altogether
to
be
explained
by
the
laws
of
imitation
it
is
still
unknown
where
imitation
and
the
principles
of
statistics
come
into
contact
and
it
is
with
regard
to
this
contact
we
find
our
greatest
difficulties
when
several
persons
commit
murder
in
the
same
way
we
call
it
imitation
but
when
definite
forms
of
disease
or
wounds
have
for
years
not
been
noticed
in
hospitals
and
then
suddenly
appear
in
numbers
we
call
it
duplication
hospital
physicians
are
familiar
with
this
phenomenon
and
count
on
the
appearance
of
a
second
case
of
any
disease
if
only
a
first
occurs
frequently
such
diseases
come
from
the
same
region
and
involve
the
same
extraordinary
abnormalities
so
that
nothing
can
be
said
about
imitation
now
how
can
imitation
and
duplication
be
distinguished
in
individual
cases
where
are
their
limits
where
do
they
touch
where
cover
each
other
where
do
the
groups
form
there
is
as
yet
no
solution
for
the
interpretation
of
the
problems
of
imitation
and
for
its
power
to
excuse
conduct
as
being
major
basis
but
the
problems
have
considerable
symptomatic
and
diagnostic
value
at
the
very
least
we
shall
be
able
to
find
the
sole
possibility
of
the
explanation
of
the
nature
or
manner
of
a
crime
in
the
origin
of
the
stimulus
to
some
particular
imitation
among
youthful
persons
women
especially
there
will
be
some
anticipatory
image
which
serves
as
a
plan
and
this
will
explain
at
least
the
otherwise
inexplicable
and
superfluous
concomitants
like
unnecessary
cruelty
and
destruction
the
knowledge
of
this
anticipatory
image
may
give
even
a
clew
to
the
criminal
for
it
may
indicate
the
nature
of
the
person
who
could
act
it
out
and
realize
it
also
in
our
field

the
condition

great
crowds

remarkable
characteristics
the
most
instructive
are
the
great
misfortunes
in
which
almost
every
unhappy
individual
conducts
himself
not
only
irrationally
but
objectively
taken
criminally
towards
his
fellows
inasmuch
as
he
sacrifices
them
to
his
own
safety
without
being
in
real
need

this
class

e
passion
and

passion
and
affection
occasion
in
our
own
minds
and
in
those
of
witnesses
considerable
confusion
of
observations
influence
or
even
effect
the
guilt
of
the
defendant
and
serve
to
explain
many
things
at
the
moment
of
examination
the
essence
of
passion
or
affection
its
definition
and
influence
its
physical
and
physiological
explanation
is
discussed
in
any
psychology
the
use
of
this
discussion
for
the
purposes
has
been
little
spoken
of
and
possibly
can
not
have
more
said
about
it
things
that
are
done
with
passion
show
themselves
as
such
and
require
no
particular
examination
in
that
respect
what
we
have
to
do
is
to
discover
what
might
have
happened
without
passion
and
especially
to
protect
ourselves
from
being
in
person
overcome
by
passion
or
affection
it
is
indubitable
that
the
most
of
the
criminalists
are
the
best
for
phlegm
and
melancholy
do
not
carry
one
through
an
examination
the
lively
and
the
passionate
judges
are
the
most
effective
but
they
also
have
the
defects
of
their
virtues
no
one
will
deny
that
it
is
difficult
to
maintain
a
calm
demeanor
with
an
impudent
denying
criminal
or
in
the
face
of
some
very
cruel
unhuman
or
terrible
crime
but
it
is
essential
to
surmount
this
difficulty
everyone
of
us
must
recall
shameful
memories
of
having
perhaps
justly
given
way
to
passion
of
course
the
very
temperamental
count
gideon
raday
freed
his
county
in
a
short
time
from
numberless
robberies
by
immediately
hanging
the
mayor
of
the
town
in
which
the
robberies
occurred
but
nowadays
so
much
temperament
is
not
permissible
it
is
well
to
recall
the
painful
position
of
an
excellent
presiding
justice
at
a
murder
trial
who
attacked
the
defendant
passionately
and
had
to
submit
to
the
really
justified
reprimand
the
only
means
of
avoiding
such
difficulties
is
not
to
begin
quarrelling
just
as
soon
as
a
single
word
is
uttered
which
is
in
any
way
improper
in
polite
society
everything
is
lost
the
word
is
the
rolling
and
how
much
momentum
it
may
gather
depends
upon
the
nature
and
the
training
of
the
judge
lonely
insults
are
not
frequent
and
a
single
improper
word
breaks
down
the
boundaries
the
criminal
knows
this
and
often
makes
use
of
his
knowledge
a
man
who
has
the
other
fellow
is
no
longer
dangerous
he
becomes
calm
and
kind
and
feels
instinctively
the
need
of
repairing
the
damage
he
has
committed
by
too
he
then
exhibits
an
exaggerated
geniality
and
care
upon
which
many
criminals
count
and
hence
intentionally
provoke
the
examiner
until
he
does
things
and
says
things
he
is
sorry
for
the
emotions
of
witnesses
especially
of
those
who
have
been
harmed
by
the
crime
and
of
those
who
have
seen
something
terrible
and
disgusting
and
who
still
tend
to
get
excited
over
it
constitute
a
great
many
difficulties
against
the
unconditional
reliability
of
such
testimony
experienced
judges
take
measures
of
defence
the
participant
of
this
class
is
never
calm
passion
anxiety
anger
personal
interest
either
anticipate
or
exaggerate
trouble
of
course
we
are
not
speaking
of
cases
in
which
a
wound
is
considerably
exaggerated
or
even
invented
for
the
sake
of
money
but
of
those
in
which
people
under
emotional
stress
often
say
unthinkable
things
about
their
enemy
just
to
get
him
punished
this
however
is
comparatively
rare
where
the
damage
has
been
very
great
a
man
who
has
lost
his
eye
the
father
of
a
raped
daughter
the
victim
impoverished
by
arson
often
behaves
very
calmly
toward
the
criminal
he
makes
no
especial
accusation
does
not
exaggerate
and
does
not
insult
a
person
however
whose
orchard
has
suffered
damage
may
behave
much
worse
it
frequently
happens
that
the
sufferer
and
the
defendant
really
hate
each
other
not
necessarily
because
one
had
broken
the
head
or
robbed
him
frequently
the
ostensible
reason
for
coming
to
trial
is
the
result
of
a
long
and
hatred
that
this
emotion
can
go
to
any
length
is
well
known
and
it
is
therefore
necessary
though
not
always
easy
to
seek
it
out
hatred
is
possible
among
peers
or
people
who
are
peers
in
one
connection
or
another
as
a
rule
the
king
will
not
be
able
to
hate
his
musketeer
but
he
will
when
they
are
both
passionately
in
love
with
the
same
girl
for
they
are
peers
in
love
similarly
the
lady
will
hardly
hate
her
maid
but
if
she
observes
the
magnificent
hair
and
believes
that
it
is
better
than
her
own
she
will
hate
the
maid
for
there
is
no
difference
in
rank
with
regard
to
the
love
of
hair
real
hate
has
only
three
sources
pain
jealousy
or
love
either
the
object
of
hatred
has
caused
his
enemy
a
great
irremediable
pain
or
jealousy
or
hatred
is
was
or
will
become
love
some
authorities
believe
that
there
is
another
source
of
hatred
which
becomes
apparent
when
we
have
done
harm
to
somebody
that
this
might
show
itself
as
hatred
or
passion
similar
to
hatred
is
possible
but
in
most
cases
it
will
probably
be
a
feeling
of
deep
shame
and
regret
which
has
certain
particular
characteristics
in
common
with
hatred
if
it
is
really
hatred
it
is
hatred
through
pain
hatred
is
difficult
to
hide
and
even
criminalists
of
small
experience
will
overlook
it
only
in
exceptional
cases
the
discovery
of
envy
which
is
less
forgiving
than
hatred
less
explosive
much
profounder
and
much
more
extensive
is
incomparably
more
difficult
real
hatred
like
exquisite
passion
requires
temperament
and
under
circumstances
may
evoke
sympathy
but
friendless
envy
any
scamp
is
capable
of
possibly
no
other
passion
endangers
and
destroys
so
many
lives
chokes
off
so
much
service
makes
impossible
so
many
significant
things
and
finally
judges
so
falsely
an
endless
number
of
persons
when
you
remember
moreover
its
exaggerated
extent
and
the
easy
trick
of
hiding
it
its
dangerous
nature
can
not
be
overestimated
we
lawyers
are
even
more
imperilled
by
it
because
we
do
not
easily
allow
people
to
be
praised
before
us
we
require
witnesses
to
speak
incriminatingly
most
of
the
time
and
we
can
not
easily
see
whether
they
are
envious
however
freely
one
man
may
speak
against
another
we
may
assume
that
he
is
telling
the
truth
or
at
worst
that
he
has
a
false
notion
of
the
matter
or
was
badly
instructed
but
we
rarely
think
that
his
envy
dictates
it
all
this
idea
occurs
to
us
when
he
is
to
praise
the
other
man
then
he
exhibits
a
cautious
tentative
narrowing
attitude
so
that
even
a
person
of
little
experience
infers
envy
and
here
the
fact
manifests
itself
that
real
envy
requires
a
certain
equality
by
way
of
example
the
petty
is
cited
as
envying
his
more
fortunate
competitor
but
not
the
great
merchant
whose
ships
go
round
the
world
the
feeling
of
the
private
toward
his
general
the
peasant
toward
his
landlord
is
not
really
envy
it
is
desire
to
be
like
him
it
is
anger
that
the
other
is
better
off
but
inasmuch
as
the
emotion
lacks
that
effective
capacity
which
we
require
for
envy
we
can
not
call
it
envy
it
becomes
envy
when
something
by
way
of
intrigue
or
evil
communication
has
been
undertaken
against
the
envied
person
thus
the
mere
is
confessed
at
once
people
say
i
envy
him
this
trip
his
magnificent
health
his
gorgeous
automobile
they
do
not
say
have
enviously
spoken
evil
of
him
or
done
this
or
that
against
yet
it
is
in
the
latter
form
that
the
actual
passion
of
envy
expresses
itself
the
capacity
of
the
envious
for
false
representation
makes
them
particularly
dangerous
in
the
if
we
want
to
discover
anything
about
an
individual
we
naturally
inquire
of
his
colleagues
his
relatives
etc
but
it
is
just
among
these
that
envy
rules
if
you
inquire
of
people
without
influence
you
learn
nothing
from
them
since
they
do
not
understand
the
matter
if
you
ask
professional
people
they
speak
enviously
or
selfishly
and
that
constitutes
our
dilemma
our
attention
may
be
called
to
envy
by
the
hesitation
his
reserved
manner
of
answering
this
is
the
same
in
all
classes
and
is
valuable
because
it
may
warn
us
against
very
bad
misunderstandings
as
a
rule
nothing
can
be
said
about
passion
as
a
source
of
crime
we
may
assume
that
passion
passes
through
three
periods
the
first
is
characterized
by
the
general
or
partial
recurrence
of
older
images
in
the
second
the
new
idea
employs
its
dominating
place
negatively
or
positively
with
respect
to
the
older
one
the
passion
culminates
and
in
the
third
the
emotional
equilibrium
is
restored
most
emotions
are
accompanied
by
physical
phenomena
some
have
been
thoroughly
studied
the
juristically
important
emotion
of
fear
in
fear
breathing
is
irregular
inspiration
is
frequently
broken
a
series
of
short
breaths
is
followed
by
one
or
more
deep
ones
inspiration
is
short
expiration
is
prolonged
one
or
the
other
is
sobbing
all
these
phenomena
are
only
a
single
consequence
of
the
increase
of
respiratory
changes
the
irregularity
of
the
latter
causes
coughing
then
a
disturbance
of
speech
which
is
induced
by
the
irregular
action
of
the
muscles
of
the
jaw
and
in
part
by
the
acceleration
of
the
breathing
in
the
stages
of
echoing
fear
yawning
occurs
and
the
distention
of
the
pupils
may
be
noticed
as
the
emotion
develops
this
is
what
we
often
see
when
a
denying
defendant
finds
himself
confounded
by
evidence
etc
the
most
remarkable
and
in
no
way
explicable
fact
is
that
these
phenomena
do
not
occur
in
innocent
people
one
might
think
that
the
fear
of
being
innocently
convicted
would
cause
an
expression
of
dread
anger
but
it
does
not
cause
an
expression
of
real
terror
i
have
no
other
than
empirical
evidence
of
the
fact
so
that
many
more
observations
are
required
before
any
fresh
inferences
are
deduced
therefrom
anent
a
guilt
or
innocence
we
must
never
forget
that
under
such
circumstances
passions
and
emotions
often
change
into
their
opposites
according
to
rule
parsimony
becomes
extravagance
and
conversely
love
becomes
hate
many
a
man
becomes
altogether
too
foolhardy
because
of
despairing
fear
so
it
may
happen
that
terror
may
become
petrifying
coldness
and
then
not
one
of
the
typical
marks
of
terror
appears
but
it
betrays
itself
just
as
certainly
by
its
icy
indifference
as
by
its
own
proper
traits
just
as
passions
transmute
into
their
opposites
so
they
carry
a
significant
company
of
subordinate
characteristics
thus
dread
or
fear
is
accompanied
by
disorderly
impertinence
sensuality
by
cruelty
the
latter
connection
is
of
great
importance
to
us
for
it
frequently
eliminates
difficulties
in
the
explanation
of
crime
that
cruelty
and
lasciviousness
have
the
same
root
has
long
been
known
the
very
ecstasy
of
adventurous
and
passionate
love
is
frequently
connected
with
a
certain
cruel
tendency
women
are
as
a
rule
more
ferocious
than
men
it
is
asserted
that
a
woman
in
love
is
constantly
desiring

man
if
this
be
true
the
foregoing
statement
is
sufficiently
explained
in
one
sense
the
connection
between
sexual
passion
and
cruelty
is
bound
up
with
that
unsatiability
which
is
characteristic
of
several
passions
it
is
best
to
be
observed
in
passions
for
property
especially
such
as
involve
the
of
money
it
is
quite
correct
to
speak
of
the
overwhelming
devilish
power
of
gold
of
the
sensual
desire
to
roll
in
gold
of
the
irresistible
ring
of
coins
etc
and
it
is
also
correctly
held
that
money
has
the
same
definite
influence
on
man
as
blood
on
preying
animals
we
all
know
innumerable
examples
of
quite
decent
people
who
were
led
to
serious
crimes
by
the
mere
sight
of
a
large
sum
of
money
knowledge
of
this
tendency
may
on
occasion
lead
to
clues
and
even
to
the
personality

the
criminal

believes
that

and
a
sense
of

are
an
extension
of
the
sense

and

of

the
painted

at
a
funeral
our
authors
are
both
right
and
wrong
for
honor
is
simply
the
position
a
man
takes
with
regard
to
the
world
so
that
even
gamins
may
be
said
to
have
honor
unwillingness
to

this
may
cause
us
criminalists
considerable
trouble
one
of
the
worst
men
i
ever
met
in
my
profession
a
person
guilty
of
the
nastiest
crimes
so
nasty
that
he
had
driven
his
honorable
parents
to
suicide
had
at
the
expiration
of
his
last
sentence
of
many
years
in
prison
said
literally
offer
no
legal
objection
against
the
sentence
i
beg
however
for
three
suspension
so
that
i
may
write
a
series
of
farewell
letters
which
i
could
not
write
as
a
even
in
the
heart
of
this
man
there
was
still
the
light
of
what
other
people
call
honor
we
often
find
similar
things
which
may
be
used
to
our
advantage
in
examination
not
of
course
for
the
purpose
of
getting
confession
accusation
of
accomplices
etc
this
might
indeed
serve
the
interests
of
the
case
but
it
is
easy
to
identify
a
pliable
attitude
with
an
honorable
inclination
and
the
former
must
certainly
not
be
exploited
even
with
the
best
intention
moreover
among
persons
of
low
degree
an
inclination
toward
decency
will
hardly
last
long
and
will
briefly
give
way
to
those
inclinations
which
are
habitual
to
bad
men
then
they
are
sorry
for
what
they
had
permitted
to
occur
in
their
better
moment
and
curse
those
who
had
made
use
of
that
moment
it
is
often
funny
to
see
the
points
at
which
the
criminal
seeks
his
what
is
proper
for
a
thief
may
be
held
improper
for
a
robber
the
burglar
hates
to
be
identified
with
the
many
a
one
finds
his
honor
in
this
wise
deeply
attacked
particularly
when
it
is
shown
him
that
he
is
betraying
an
accomplice
or
that
he
has
swindled
his
comrades
in
the
division
of
booty
etc
i
remember
one
thief
who
was
inconsolable
because
the
papers
mentioned
that
he
had
foolishly
overlooked
a
large
sum
of
money
in
a
burglary
this
would
indicate
that
criminals
have
professional
ambitions
and
seek
professional
fame

a
mistakes
of
the
senses
section
general
considerations
as
sensation
is
the
basis
of
knowledge
the
sensory
process
must
be
the
basis
of
the
correctness
of
legal
procedure
the
information
we
get
from
our
senses
and
on
which
we
construct
our
conclusion
may
be
said
all
in
all
to
be
reliable
so
that
we
are
not
justified
in
approaching
things
we
assume
to
depend
on
with
exaggerated
caution
nevertheless
this
perception
is
not
always
completely
correct
and
the
knowledge
of
its
mistakes
must
help
us
and
even
cause
us
to
wonder
that
we
make
no
greater
ones
psychological
examination
of
has
been
going
on
since
heraclitus
most
of
the
mistakes
discovered
have
been
used
for
various
purposes
from
sport
to
science
they
are
surprising
and
attract
and
sustain
public
attention
they
have
hence
become
familiar
but
their
influence
upon
other
phenomena
and
their
consequences
in
the
daily
life
have
rarely
been
studied
for
two
reasons
first
because
such
illusions
seem
to
be
small
and
their
effects
are
rarely
thought
of
as
when
a
line
drawn
on
paper
seems
longer
or
more
inclined
than
it
really
is
secondly
it
is
supposed
that
the
influence
of
sensory
illusions
can
not
easily
make
a
difference
in
practical
life
if
the
illusion
is
observed
it
is
thereby
rendered
harmless
and
can
have
no
effect
if
it
is
not
observed
and
later
on
leads
to
serious
consequences
their
cause
can
not
possibly
be
sought
out
because
it
can
not
be
recognized
as
such
and
because
there
have
been
so
many
intermediate
steps
that
a
correct
retroduction
is
impossible
this
demonstrates
the
rarity
of
a
practical
consideration
of
but
does
not
justify
that
rarity
of
course
there
are
great
difficulties
in
applying
results
of
limited
experiments
to
extensive
conditions
they
arise
from
the
assumption
that
the
conditions
will
be
similar
to
those
which
the
scientist
studies
and
that
a
situation
which
exhibits
certain
phenomena
under
narrow
experimental
conditions
will
show
them
also
in
the
large
but
this
is
not
the
case
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
results
of
modern
psychology
have
remained
practically
unproductive
this
of
course
is
not
a
reproach
to
the
discipline
of
experimental
psychology
or
an
assault
upon
the
value
of
its
researches
its
narrow
limitations
were
necessary
if
anything
definite
was
to
be
discovered
but
once
this
has
been
discovered
the
conditions
may
be
extended
and
something
practical
may
be
attained
to
particularly
in
the
matter
of
illusion
of
sense
and
this
possibility
disposes
of
the
second
reason
for
not
paying
attention
to
these
illusions
witnesses
do
not
of
course
know
that
they
have
suffered
from
illusions
of
sense
we
rarely
hear
them
complain
of
it
anyway
and
it
is
for
this
very
reason
that
the
criminalist
must
seek
it
out
the
requirement
involves
great
difficulties
for
we
get
very
little
help
from
the
immense
literature
on
the
subject
there
are
two
roads
to
its
fulfilment
in
the
first
place
we
must
understand
the
phenomenon
as
it
occurs
in
our
work
and
by
tracing
it
back
determine
whether
and
which
illusion
of
the
sense
may
have
caused
an
abnormal
or
otherwise
unclear
fact
the
other
road
is
the
theoretical
one
which
must
be
called
in
this
respect
the
preparatory
road
it
requires
our
mastery
of
all
that
is
known
of
and
particularly
of
such
examples
of
its
hidden
nature
as
exist
much
of
the
material
of
this
kind
is
however
irrelevant
to
our
purpose
particularly
all
that
deals
with
disease
and
lies
in
the
field
of
medicine
of
course
where
the
nature
of
the
disease
is
uncertain
or
its
very
presence
is
unknown
it
is
as
well
for
us
to
consider
the
case
as
for
the
physician
but
above
all
it
is
our
duty
to
consult
the
physician
apart
from
what
belongs
to
the
physician
there
is
the
material
which
concerns
other
professions
than
ours
that
must
be
set
aside
though
increasing
knowledge
may
require
us
to
make
use
even
of
that
it
is
indubitable
that
we
make
many
observations
in
which
we
get
the
absolute
impression
that
matters
of
sensory
illusion
which
do
not
seem
to
concern
us
lie
behind
some
observations
although
we
can
not
accurately
indicate
what
they
are
the
only
thing
to
do
when
this
occurs
is
either
to
demonstrate
the
possibility
of
their
presence
or
to
wait
for
some
later
opportunity
to
test
the
witness
for
them
classification
will
ease
our
task
a
great
deal
the
apparently
most
important
divisions
are
those
of
and
but
as
the
boundary
between
them
is
indefinite
it
would
be
well
to
consider
that
there
is
a
third
class
which
can
not
fall
under
either
heading
this
is
a
class
where
especially
a
group
of
somatic
conditions
either
favor
or
cause
illusory
a
rather
stomach
a
rush
of
blood
to
the
head
a
wakeful
night
physical
or
mental
these
conditions
are
not
abnormal
or
diseased
but
as
they
are
not
habitual
they
are
not
normal
either
if
the
overloaded
stomach
has
turned
into
a
mild
indigestion
the
increase
of
blood
into
congestion
then
we
are
very
near
disease
but
the
boundary
between
that
and
the
other
condition
can
not
be
determined
another
question
is
the
limit
at
which
illusions
of
sense
begin
how
indeed
they
can
be
distinguished
from
correct
perceptions
the
possibility
of
doing
so
depends
upon
the
typical
construction
of
the
in
man
by
oneself
it
would
be
impossible
to
determine
which
sensation
is
intrinsically
correct
and
which
is
an
illusion
there
are
a
great
many
illusions
of
sense
which
all
men
suffer
from
under
similar
conditions
so
that
the
judgment
of
the
majority
can
not
be
normative
nor
can
the
control
of
one
sense
by
another
serve
to
distinguish
illusory
from
correct
perception
in
many
cases
it
is
quite
possible
to
test
the
sense
of
sight
by
touch
or
the
sense
of
hearing
by
sight
but
that
is
not
always
so
the
simplest
thing
is
to
say
that
a
is
correct
and
implies
reality
when
it
remains
identical
under
various
circumstances
in
various
conditions
when
connected
with
other
senses
and
observed
by
different
men
with
different
instruments
it
is
illusory
when
it
is
not
so
constant
but
here
again
the
limit
of
the
application
of
the
term
is
difficult
to
indicate
that
distant
things
seem
to
be
smaller
than
they
are
that
railway
tracks
and
two
sides
of
a
street
seem
to
run
together
are
intrinsically
real
illusions
of
sense
but
they
are
not
so
called
they
are
called
the
laws
of
perspective
so
that
it
would
seem
that
we
must
add
to
the
notion
of
that
of
rarity
or
extraordinary
appearance
i
have
found
still
another
distinction
which
i
consider
important
it
consists
in
the
difference
between
real
illusions
and
those
false
conceptions
in
which
the
mistake
originates
as
false
inference
in
the
former
the
sense
organ
has
been
really
registering
wrongly
as
when
for
example
the
pupil
of
the
eye
is
pressed
laterally
and
everything
is
seen
double
but
when
i
see
a
landscape
through
a
piece
of
red
glass
and
believe
the
landscape
to
be
really
red
the
mistake
is
one
of
inference
only
since
i
have
not
included
the
effect
of
the
glass
in
my
concluding
conception
so
again
when
in
a
rain
i
believe
mountains
to
be
nearer
than
they
really
are
or
when
i
believe
the
stick
in
the
water
to
be
really
bent
my
sensations
are
perfectly
correct
but
my
inferences
are
wrong
in
the
last
instance
even
a
photograph
will
show
the
stick
in
water
as
bent
this
difference
in
the
nature
of
illusion
is
particularly
evident
in
those
phenomena
of
expectation
that
people
tend
to
miscall
of
if
in
church
anybody
hears
a
dull
weak
tone
he
will
believe
that
the
organ
is
beginning
to
sound
because
it
is
appropriate
to
assume
that
in
the
presence
of
a
train
of
steam
cars
which
shows
every
sign
of
being
ready
to
start
you
may
easily
get
the
illusion
that
it
is
already
going
now
how
is
the
sense
to
have
been
mistaken
in
such
cases
the
ear
has
really
heard
a
noise
the
eye
has
really
seen
a
train
and
both
have
registered
correctly
but
it
is
not
their
function
to
qualify
the
impression
they
register
and
if
the
imagination
then
effects
a
false
inference
that
can
not
be
called
an
illusion
of
sensation
the
incorrectness
of
such
classification
becomes
still
more
obvious
when
some
numerical
arithmetical
demonstration
can
be
given
of
the
presence
of
faulty
inference
for
example
if
i
see
through
the
window
a
man
very
far
away
clearing
a
lot
with
an
ax
i
naturally
see
the
ax
fall
before
i
hear
the
noise
of
the
blow
now
it
may
happen
that
the
distance
may
be
just
great
enough
to
make
me
hear
the
sound
of
the
second
blow
at
the
moment
in
which
i
see
the
delivery
of
the
third
blow
thus
i
perceive
at
the
same
moment
in
spite
of
the
great
distance
both
the
phenomena
of
light
and
of
sound
just
as
if
i
were
directly
on
the
spot
perhaps
i
will
wonder
at
first
about
these
physical
anomalies
and
then
if
i
have
made
my
simple
mistake
in
inference
i
shall
tell
somebody
about
the
remarkable
i
had
today
although
no
one
had
ever
supposed
me
capable
of
being
deceived
in
this
way
schopenhauer
calls
attention
to
the
familiar
fact
that
on
waking
after
a
short
nap
all
localizations
are
apparently
perverted
and
the
mind
does
not
know
what
is
in
front
what
behind
what
to
the
right
and
what
to
the
left
to
call
also
this
sensory
illusion
would
again
be
wrong
since
the
mind
is
not
fully
awake
and
sufficiently
orientated
to
know
clearly
its
condition
the
matter
is
different
when
we
do
not
properly
estimate
an
uncustomary
a
light
touch
in
an
unaccustomed
part
of
the
body
is
felt
as
a
heavy
weight
after
the
loss
of
a
tooth
we
feel
an
enormous
cave
in
the
mouth
and
what
a
nonsensical
idea
we
have
of
what
is
happening
when
the
dentist
is
drilling
a
hole
in
a
tooth
in
all
these
cases
the
senses
have
received
a
new
impression
which
they
have
not
yet
succeeded
in
judging
properly
and
hence
make
a
false
announcement
of
the
object
it
is
to
this
fact
that
all
fundamentally
incorrect
judgments
of
new
impressions
must
be
attributed
for
example
when
we
pass
from
darkness
into
bright
light
and
find
it
very
sharp
when
we
find
a
cellar
warm
in
winter
that
we
believe
to
be
in
summer
when
we
suppose
ourselves
to
be
high
up
in
the
air
the
first
time
we
are
on
horseback
etc
now
the
actual
presence
of
sensory
illusions
is
especially
important
to
us
because
we
must
make
certain
tests
to
determine
whether
testimony
depends
on
them
or
not
and
it
is
of
great
moment
to
know
whether
the
illusions
depend
on
the
mind
or
on
his
senses
we
may
trust
a
intellect
and
not
his
senses
and
conversely
from
the
very
beginning
it
would
be
superfluous
to
talk
of
the
importance
of
sensory
illusion
in
the
determination
of
a
sentence
the
correctness
of
the
judgment
depends
on
the
correctness
of
the
transmitted
observations
and
to
understand
the
nature
of
and
its
frequency
is
to
know
its
significance
for
punishment
there
are
many
mistakes
of
judges
based
entirely
on
ignorance
of
this
matter
once
a
man
who
claimed
in
spite
of
absolute
darkness
to
have
recognized
an
opponent
who
punched
him
in
the
eye
was
altogether
believed
simply
because
it
was
assumed
that
the
punch
was
so
vigorous
that
the
wounded
man
saw
sparks
by
the
light
of
which
he
could
recognize
the
other
and
yet
already
aristotle
knew
that
such
sparks
are
only
subjective
but
that
such
things
were
believed
is
a
notable
warning
section
it
will
be
best
to
begin
the
study
of
optical
illusions
with
the
consideration
of
those
conditions
which
cause
extraordinary
lunatic
images
they
are
important
because
the
illusion
is
recognizable
with
respect
to
the
possibility
of
varied
interpretations
by
any
observer
and
because
anybody
may
experiment
for
himself
with
a
bit
of
paper
on
the
nature
of
false
optical
apprehension
if
we
should
demonstrate
no
more
than
that
the
simplest
conditions
often
involve
coarse
mistakes
much
will
have
been
accomplished
for
the
law
since
the
of
our
senses
would
then
show
itself
to
need
corroboration
nothing
is
proved
with
have
seen
it
myself
for
a
mistake
in
one
point
shows
the
equal
possibility
of
mistakes
in
all
other
points
generally
it
may
be
said
that
the
position
of
lines
is
not
without
influence
on
the
estimation
of
their
size
perpendicular
dimensions
are
taken
to
be
somewhat
greater
than
they
are
of
two
crossed
lines
the
vertical
one
seems
longer
although
it
is
really
equal
to
the
horizontal
one
an
oblong
lying
on
its
somewhat
longer
side
is
taken
to
be
a
square
if
we
set
it
on
the
shorter
side
it
seems
to
be
still
more
oblong
than
it
really
is
if
we
divide
a
square
into
equal
angles
we
take
the
nearer
horizontal
ones
to
be
larger
so
that
we
often
take
an
angle
of
thirty
degrees
to
be
habit
has
much
influence
here
it
will
hardly
be
believed
and
certainly
is
not
consciously
known
that
in
the
letter
s
the
upper
curve
has
a
definitely
smaller
radius
than
the
lower
one
but
the
inverted
s
shows
this
at
once
to
such
types
other
false
estimations
belong
inclinations
roofs
appear
so
steep
in
the
distance
that
it
is
said
to
be
impossible
to
move
on
them
without
especial
help
but
whoever
does
move
on
them
finds
the
inclination
not
at
all
so
great
hence
it
is
necessary
whenever
the
ascension
of
some
inclined
plane
is
declared
impossible
to
inquire
whether
the
author
of
the
declaration
was
himself
there
or
whether
he
had
judged
the
thing
at
a
distance
slight
crooks
are
underestimated
exner
rightly
calls
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
going
round
the
rotunda
of
the
viennese
prater
he
always
reached
the
exit
much
sooner
than
he
expected
this
is
due
to
the
presence
of
slight
deviations
and
on
them
are
based
the
numerous
false
estimates
of
distance
and
the
curious
fact
that
people
on
being
lost
at
night
in
the
woods
go
round
in
a
significantly
small
circle
it
is
frequently
observed
that
persons
who
for
one
reason
or
another
robbery
maltreatment
a
burglarious
assault
had
fled
into
the
woods
to
escape
found
themselves
at
daybreak
in
spite
of
their
flight
very
near
the
place
of
the
crime
so
that
their
honesty
in
fleeing
seems
hardly
believable
nevertheless
it
may
be
perfectly
trustworthy
even
though
in
the
daytime
the
fugitive
might
be
altogether
at
home
in
the
woods
he
has
simply
underestimated
the
deviations
he
has
made
and
hence
believes
that
he
has
moved
at
most
in
a
very
flat
arc
supposing
himself
to
be
going
forward
and
leaving
the
wood
he
has
really
been
making
a
sharp
arc
and
always
in
the
same
direction
so
that
his
path
has
really
been
circular
some
corroboration
for
this
illusion
is
supplied
by
the
fact
that
the
left
eye
sees
objects
on
the
left
too
small
while
the
right
eye
underestimates
the
right
side
of
objects
this
underestimation
varies
from
to
these
are
magnitudes
which
may
naturally
be
of
importance
and
which
in
the
dark
most
affect
deviations
that
are
closely
regarded
on
the
inner
side
of
the
eye
deviations
to
the
left
of
the
left
eye
or
the
right
of
the
right
eye
such
confusions
become
most
troublesome
when
other
estimations
are
added
to
them
so
long
as
the
informant
knows
that
he
has
only
been
estimating
the
danger
is
not
too
great
but
as
a
rule
the
informant
does
not
regard
his
conception
as
an
estimate
but
as
certain
knowledge
he
does
not
say

says

aubert
tells
how
the
astronomer
f√∂rster
had
a
number
of
educated
men
physicians
estimate
the
diameter
of
the
moon
the
estimation
varied
from
to
and
more
the
proper
diameter
is
at
a
distance
of
it
is
well
known
that
an
unfurnished
room
seems
much
smaller
than
a
furnished
one
and
a
lawn
covered
with
snow
smaller
than
a
one
we
are
regularly
surprised
when
we
find
an
enormous
new
structure
on
an
apparently
small
lot
or
when
a
lot
is
parcelled
out
into
smaller
building
lots
when
they
are
planked
off
we
marvel
at
the
number
of
planks
which
can
be
laid
on
the
surface
the
illusions
are
still
greater
when
we
look
upward
we
are
less
accustomed
to
estimation
of
verticals
than
of
horizontals
an
object
on
the
gutter
of
a
roof
seems
much
smaller
than
at
a
similar
distance
on
the
ground
this
can
be
easily
observed
if
any
figure
which
has
been
on
the
roof
of
a
house
for
years
is
once
brought
down
even
if
it
is
horizontally
twice
as
far
as
the
height
of
the
house
the
figure
still
seems
larger
than
before
that
this
illusion
is
due
to
defective
practice
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
children
make
mistakes
which
adults
find
inconceivable
helmholtz
tells
how
as
child
he
asked
his
mother
to
get
him
the
little
dolls
from
the
gallery
of
a
very
high
tower
i
remember
myself
that
at
five
years
i
proposed
to
my
comrades
to
hold
my
ankles
so
that
i
could
reach
for
a
ball
from
the
second
story
of
a
house
down
to
the
i
had
estimated
the
height
as
of
its
actual
magnitude
certain
standards
of
under
and
overestimations
are
given
us
when
there
is
near
the
object
to
be
judged
an
object
the
size
of
which
we
know
the
reason
for
the
fact
that
trees
and
buildings
get
such
ideal
sizes
on
heroic
landscape
is
the
artistically
reduced
scale
i
know
that
few
pictures
have
made
such
a
devilish
impression
on
me
as
an
enormous
landscape
something
in
the
style
of
claude
lorraine
covering
half
a
wall
in
its
foreground
there
is
to
be
seen
a
clerk
riding
a
horse
in
a
glen
rider
and
horse
are
a
few
inches
high
and
because
of
this
the
already
enormous
landscape
becomes
frightfully
big
i
saw
the
picture
as
a
student
and
even
now
i
can
describe
all
its
details
without
the
diminutive
clerk
it
would
have
had
no
particular
effect
in
this
connection
we
must
not
forget
that
the
relations
of
magnitude
of
things
about
us
are
because
of
perspective
so
uncertain
that
we
no
longer
pay
any
attention
to
them
find
it
difficult
says
lipps
believe
that
the
oven
which
stands
in
the
corner
of
the
room
does
not
look
larger
than
my
hand
when
i
hold
it
a
foot
away
from
my
eyes
or
that
the
moon
is
not
larger
than
the
head
of
a
pin
which
i
look
at
a
little
more
closely
we
must
not
forget
how
we
are
in
the
custom
of
comparing
i
compare
hand
and
oven
and
i
think
of
the
hand
in
terms
of
the
that
is
because
we
know
how
large
the
hand
and
the
oven
are
but
very
often
we
compare
things
the
sizes
of
which
we
do
not
know
or
which
we
can
not
so
easily
get
at
and
then
there
are
many
extraordinary
illusions
in
connection
with
the
cited
incident
of
the
estimation
of
the
diameter
there
is
the
illusion
of
thomas
reid
who
saw
that
the
moon
seemed
as
large
as
a
plate
when
looked
at
with
the
unhampered
eye
but
as
large
as
a
dollar
when
looked
at
through
a
tube
this
mistake
establishes
the
important
fact
that
the
size
of
the
orifice
influences
considerably
the
estimation
of
the
size
of
objects
seen

an
explanation
of
many
sensory

may
be
found
in
the
illusory
lines
they
have
been
much
studied
but
z√∂llner
has
been
the
first
to
show
their
character
thus
really
quite
parallel
lines
are
made
to
appear
unparallel
by
the
juxtaposition
of
inclined
or
crossing
lines
in
figures
and
both
the
horizontal
lines
are
actually
parallel

determined
in

fig
still
more
significant
is
the
illusion
in

the

clear
the
length
of
the
lines
makes
no
difference
in
the
illusion
on

the
diagonals
must
be
definitely
thicker
than

horizontal

if
those

that
the

is
what
destroys
the
appearance
of
parallels
is
shown
by
the
simple
case
given
in

the

from

as
great

all
who
have

might
put
us
in
a
position
to
account
for
a
large
number
of
practical
difficulties
but
certain
as
the
facts
are
we
are
still
far
from
their
and
we
may
believe
that
the
phenomenon
shown
in
figs
and
appears
when
the
boundaries
of
a
field
come
straight
up
to
a
street
with
parallel
sides
with
the
result
that
at
the
point
of
meeting
the
street
seems
to
be
bent
in
probably
we
have
observed
this
frequently
without
being
aware
of
it
and
have
laid
no
particular
stress
on
it
first
of
all
because
it
was
really
unimportant
and
secondly
because
we
thought
that
the
street
was
really
not
straight
at
that
point
in
a
like
manner
we
may
have
seen
the
effect
of
angles
as
shown
in
figs
and
on
streets
where
houses
or
were
built
cornerwise
then
the
line
between
the
corners
seemed
longer
or
shorter
and
as
we
had
no
reason
for
seeking
an
accurate
judgment
we
paid
no
attention
to
its
status
we
simply
should
have
made
a
false
estimate
of
length
if
we
had
been
required
to
judge
it
it
is
also
likely
that
we
may
have
supposed
an
actual
or
suppository
line
on
the
side
of
the
gables
of
a
house
enclosed
by
angles
of
the
gables
to
be
short
but
until
now
the
knowledge
of
this
supposition
has
had
no
practical
value
nevertheless
the
significance
of
these
illusions
should
not
be
underestimated
they
mean
most
of
all
the
fact
that
we
really
can
be
much
deceived
even
to
the
degree
of
swearing
to
the
size
of
a
simple
thing
and
yet
being
quite
innocently
mistaken
this
possibility
shows
moreover
that
the
certainty
of
our
judgment
according
to
sensible
standards
is
inadequate
and
we
have
no
way
of
determining
how
great
this
inadequacy
is
we
have
already
indicated
that
we
know
only
the
examples
cited
by
z√∂llner
delboeuf
and
others
it
is
probable
that
they
were
hit
upon
by
accident
and
that
similar
ones
can
not
be
discovered
empirically
or
intentionally
hence
it
may
be
assumed
that
such
illusions
occur
in
great
number
and
even
in
large
dimensions
for
example
it
is
known
that
thompson
discovered
his
familiar
circle
six
circles
arranged
in
a
circle
another
in
the
middle
each
possesses
bent
radii
which
turn
individually
if
the
whole
drawing
is
itself
turned
in
a
circle
by
the
accident
of
having
seen
the
geometrical
ornament
drawn
by
a
pupil
whoever
deals
with
such
optical
illusions
may
see
very
remarkable
ones
in
almost
every
sample
of
clothes
particularly
percale
and
also
in
types
of
carpets
and
furniture
and
these
are
too
complicated
to
be
described
in
the
course
of
time
another
collection
of
such
illusions
will
be
discovered
and
an
explanation
of
them
will
be
forthcoming
and
then
it
may
be
possible
to
determine
how
our
knowledge
of
their
existence
can
be
turned

practical
use

whether

a

a
rule
considerably
distant
i
know
further
that
considerably
distant
objects
seem
much
smaller
and
hence
i
must
assume
that
the
horse
which
in
spite
of
its
imaginary
distance
appears
to
retain
its
natural
size
is
really
larger
than
it
is
the
train
of
thought
is
as
follows
see
the
horse
indistinctly
it
seems
to
be
far
away
it
is
in
spite
of
its
distance
of
great
size
how
enormous
it
must
be
when
it
is
close
to
me
of
course
these
inferences
are
neither
slow
nor
conscious
they
occur
in
reflection
with
swiftness
and
make
no
difference
to
the
certainty
of
the
instantaneous
judgment
hence
it
is
frequently
very
difficult
to
discover
the
process
and
the
mistake
it
contains
if
however
the
observer
finds
an
inexplicable
hiatus
in
an
event
he
happens
to
notice
he
finds
it
strange
because
unintelligible
in
this
way
is
created
that
notion
of
strangeness
which
often
plays
so
great
a
r√¥le
in
the
examination
of
witnesses
hence
when
under
otherwise
uncomfortable
conditions
i
see
a
horse
run
without
hearing
the
beat
of
his
hoofs
when
i
see
trees
sway
without
feeling
any
storm
when
i
meet
a
man
who
in
spite
of
the
moonlight
has
no
shadow
i
feel
them
to
be
very
strange
because
something
is
lacking
in
their
logical
development
as
events
now
from
the
moment
a
thing
becomes
strange
to
an
individual
his
perceptions
are
no
longer
reliable
it
is
doubtful
whether
he
knows
what
he
has
really
experienced
before
his
world
became
strange
to
him
add
to
this
that
few
people
are
unwilling
to
confess
that
they
felt
ill
at
ease
that
perhaps
they
do
not
even
know
it
and
you
get
the
complicated
substitution
of
sensory
illusions
and
uncanny
sensation
the
one
causing
the
other
the
other
magnifying
the
one
and
so
on
until
the
whole
affair
is
turned
into
something
quite
unrecognizable
so
we
find
ourselves
in
the
presence
of
one
of
the
inexplicable
situations
of
the
reality
of
which
we
are
assured
by
the
most
trustworthy
individuals
to
magnify
this
phenomenon
we
need
only
think
of
a
few
slightly
abnormal
cases
it
has
already
been
indicated
that
there
are
many
such
which
are
not
diseased
and
further
that
many
diseased
cases
occur
which
are
not
known
as
such
at
least
as
being
so
much
so
as
to
make
the
judge
call
in
the
doctor
this
is
the
more
likely
because
there
are
frequently
if
i
may
say
so
localized
diseases
which
do
not
exhibit
any
extraordinary
symptoms
at
least
to
laymen
and
hence
offer
no
reason
for
calling
in
experts
if
we
set
aside
all
real
diseases
which
are
connected
with
optical
illusions
as
not
concerning
us
there
are
still
left
instances
enough
for
example
any
medical
will
tell
you
that
morphine
fiends
and
victims
of
the
cocaine
habit
have
very
strong
tendencies
to
optical
illusions
and
are
often
tortured
by
them
if
the
disease
is
sufficiently
advanced
such
subjects
will
be
recognized
by
the
physician
at
a
single
glance
but
the
layman
can
not
make
this
immediate
diagnosis
he
will
get
the
impression
that
he
is
dealing
with
a
very
nervous
invalid
but
not
with
one
who
is
subject
to
optical
illusions
so
we
rarely
hear
from
a
witness
that
he
knows
such
people
and
certainly
not
that
he
is
one
himself
a
very
notable
oculist
himly
was
the
first
to
have
made
the
observation
that
in
the
diseased
excitability
of
the
retina
every
color
is
a
tone
higher
luminous
black
looks
blue
blue
looks
violet
violet
looks
red
red
looks
yellow
torpor
of
the
retina
inverts
the
substitution
dietz
tells
of
following
upon
insignificant
indigestion
foder√®
of
hysterics
who
see
everything
reversed
and
hoppe
says
the
order
of
the
rods
and
cones
of
the
retina
is
somewhat
disturbed
by
an
inflammatory
touch
the
equilibrium
of
vision
is
altered
and
changes
in
size
in
form
or
appearance
naturally
the
criminalist
can
not
perceive
slight
indigestion
weak
hysteria
or
an
inflamed
area
in
the
retina
when
he
is
examining
witnesses
yet
false
observations
like
those
described
may
have
a
definite
influence
upon
the
decision
in
a
case
if
such
abnormal
occasions
are
lacking
the
reasons
for
optical
illusions
are
of
another
nature
as
a
rule
optical
illusions
occur
when
there
is
an
interruption
in
the
communication
between
the
retina
the
sense
of
movement
and
the
sense
of
touch
or
when
we
are
prevented
from
reducing
the
changes
of
the
retinal
image
to
the
movement
of
our
body
or
of
our
eyes
this
reduction
goes
on
so
unconsciously
that
we
see
the
idea
of
the
object
and
its
condition
as
a
unit
again
it
is
indubitable
that
the
movement
of
the
body
seems
quicker
when
we
observe
it
with
a
fixed
glance
than
when
we
follow
it
with
our
eyes
the
difference
may
be
so
significant
that
it
is
often
worth
while
when
much
depends
on
determining
the
speed
of
some
act
in
a
criminal
case
to
ask
how
the
thing
was
looked
at
fechner
has
made
a
examination
of
the
old
familiar
fact
that
things
on
the
ground
appear
to
run
when
we
ride
by
them
rapidly
this
fact
may
be
compared
with
the
other
that
when
you
look
directly
into
water
from
a
low
bridge
the
latter
seems
all
of
a
sudden
to
be
swimming
rapidly
up
stream
though
the
water
does
not
appear
to
stand
still
here
some
unknown
factor
is
at
work
and
may
exercise
considerable
influence
on
many
other
phenomena
without
our
being
able
to
observe
the
results
to
this
class
may
be
added
the
extraordinary
phenomenon
that
from
the
train
objects
easily
seem
too
near
and
hence
appear
smaller
than
they
are
it
may
be
however
that
the
converse
is
true
and
objects
appear
smaller
or
at
least
shorter
and
that
inasmuch
as
we
are
in
the
habit
of
attributing
the
diminution
of
size
in
objects
to
their
distance
we
tax
the
latter
as
false
so
much
is
certain
that
whenever
we
ourselves
move
quickly
we
make
false
judgments
of
size
distance
and
even
color
the
last
may
be
due
to
the
fact
that
during
a
quick
passage
colors
may
so
compose
themselves
that
green
and
red
become
white
and
blue
and
yellow
green
etc
i
believe
that
all
these
illusions
are
increasing
in
connection
with
the
spread
of
bicycling
inasmuch
as
many
observations
are
made
from
the
fleeting
wheel
and
its
motion
tends
to
increase
the
illusions
considerably
concerning
the
differences
in
movement
stricker
says
i
lie
on
my
back
and
see
a
bird
fly
in
the
uniformly
blue
heaven
i
recognize
the
movement
although
i
have
no
object
with
which
to
compare
it
this
can
not
be
explained
by
the
variety
of
points
on
the
retina
which
are
affected
for
when
the
bird
pauses
and
i
turn
my
eye
i
know
that
it
is
not
the
last
argument
is
not
correct
if
the
bird
is
sitting
on
a
branch
i
know
in
spite
of
all
my
occipital
movement
that
it
is
quiet
but
only
because
i
perceive
and
observe
the
immobility
if
however
i
lie
on
my
back
like
stricker
and
see
above
me
a
bird
of
the
class
that
so
to
speak
swim
motionless
in
the
air
for
minutes
at
a
time
and
if
then
i
turn
my
head
i
can
not
tell
when
the
bird
begins
to
move
here
then
we
have
no
exception
to
the
general
rule
and
can
always
say
that
we
are
speaking
of
movement
optically
perceived
when
the
rays
issuing
from
any
body
progressively
touch
various
points
on
the
retina
and
since
this
occurs
when
we
are
in
motion
as
well
as
when
the
object
is
in
motion
it
happens
that
we
can
not
locate
the
movement
we
can
not
say
whether
it
be
in
us
or
in
the
object
of
course
the
possibility
that
fanciful
images
may
appear
during
movement
is
familiar
if
i
sit
quietly
in
the
forest
and
at
some
distance
see
a
stone
or
a
piece
of
wood
or
a
little
heap
of
dried
leaves
it
may
be
that
because
of
some
illusion
i
take
it
to
be
a
rolled
up
hedgehog
and
it
may
happen
that
i
am
so
convinced
of
the
nature
of
the
object
while
i
am
looking
at
it
that
i
see
how
the
hedgehog
stretches
itself
sticks
out
its
paws
and
makes
other
movements
i
remember
one
winter
when
because
of
some
delay
a
commission
on
which
i
was
serving
had
failed
to
reach
a
village
not
far
from
the
capital
we
had
gone
to
investigate
a
murder
case
and
had
found
the
body
frozen
stiff
the
oven
in
the
room
was
heated
and
the
placed
the
stiff
body
near
the
oven
in
order
to
thaw
it
out
we
at
this
time
were
examining
the
place
after
a
while
i
was
instructed
by
the
examining
justice
to
see
about
the
condition
of
the
corpse
and
much
to
my
disgust
i
found
it
sitting
near
the
oven
bent
over
it
had
thawed
out
and
collapsed
during
the
subsequent
obduction
i
saw
most
clearly
how
the
corpse
made
all
kinds
of
movements
and
even
after
the
section
during
the
dictation
of
the
protocol
my
imagination
still
seemed
to
see
the
corpse
moving
a
hand
or
a
foot
the
imagination
may
also
cause
changes
in
color
once
i
saw
on
my
desk
which
stood
next
to
a
window
a
great
round
drop
of
water
on
the
left
side
of
which
the
panes
of
the
window
were
reflected
fig
the
whole
business
was
about
a
meter
from
my
eye
i
saw
it
repeatedly
while
working
and
it
finally
occurred
to
me
to
inquire
how
such
a
great
drop
of
water
could
get
there
i
had
sat
at
my
desk
for
hours
without
moving
i
must
have
observed
it
if
it
had
dropped
there
refraining
intentionally
from
going
closer
i
started
without
avail
to
consider
how
it
could
have
come
some
time
after
i
examined
the
drop
of
water
and
found
it
to
be
an
long
ago
completely
dried
and
bearing
on
its
left
side
a
few
grains
of
white
cigar
ash
i
had
taken
these
to
be
the
image
of
the
window
and
hence
had
immediately
attached
to
it
the
idea
of
the
shining
raised
drop
of
water
i
had
altogether
overlooked
the
deep
black
color
of
the
drop
on
the
witness
stand
i
would
have
sworn
that
i
had
seen
a
drop
of
water
even
if
i
had
known
the
evidence
on
the
matter
to
be
important
illustration
fig
in
many
cases
it
is
possible
to
control
the
imagination
but
only
when
it
is
known
that
the
images
can
not
be
as
they
are
seen
everybody
is
aware
how
a
object
at
a
distance
or
objects
accidentally
grouped
in
one
way
or
another
are
taken
for
god
knows
what
thus
once
looking
from
my
desk
to
my
smoking
table
i
saw
an
enormous
pair
of
scissors
by
a
letter
it
remained
identical
under
a
number
of
repeated
glances
only
when
i
thought
vigorously
that
such
a
thing
could
not
possibly
be
in
my
room
did
it
disappear
a
few
scales
of
ashes
the
lower
round
of
the
match
safe
the
metal
trimmings
of
two
cigar
boxes
by
a
letter
and
reflected
by
the
uncertain
light
breaking
through
the
branches
of
a
tree
were
all
that
the
scissors
was
composed
of
if
there
had
been
such
a
thing
in
the
house
or
if
i
had
believed
something
like
it
to
exist
in
the
house
i
should
have
sought
no
further
and
should
have
taken
my
oath
that
i
had
seen
the
thing
it
is
significant
that
from
the
moment
i
understood
the
phenomenon
i
could
not
restore
the
image
of
the
scissors
how
often
may
similar
things
be
of
importance
in
criminal
trials
the
captivation
of
our
visual
capacity
plays
a
not
unimportant
part
in
distinguishing
correct
from
illusory
seeing
in
order
to
see
correctly
we
must
look
straight
and
fully
at
the
object
looking
askance
gives
only
an
approximate
image
and
permits
the
imagination
free
play
anybody
lost
in
a
brown
study
who
pictures
some
point
in
the
room
across
the
way
with
his
eyes
can
easily
mistake
a
fly
which
he
sees
confusedly
askance
for
a
great
big
bird
again
the
type
of
a
book
seems
definitely
smaller
if
the
eyes
are
fixed
on
the
point
of
a
lead
pencil
with
a
certain
distance
before
or
above
the
book
and
yet
again
if
you
stand
so
that
at
an
angle
of
about
degrees
from
the
fixation
point
you
look
at
a
white
door
in
a
dark
wall
observing
its
extent
in
indirect
vision
you
will
find
it
much
higher
than
in
direct
vision
these
examples
indicate
how
indirect
vision
may
be
corrected
by
later
correct
vision
but
such
correction
occurs
rarely
we
see
something
indirectly
we
find
it
uninteresting
and
do
not
look
at
it
directly
when
it
becomes
of
importance
later
on
perhaps
enters
into
a
criminal
case
we
think
that
we
have
seen
the
thing
as
it
is
and
often
swear
that
fly
is
a
big
there
are
a
number
of
accidents
which
tend
to
complete
illusion
suppose
that
the
vision
of
a
fly
which
has
been
seen
indirectly
and
taken
for
a
big
bird
happens
to
be
synchronous
with
the
shriek
of
some
bird
of
prey
i
combine
the
two
and
am
convinced
that
i
have
seen
that
bird
of
prey
this
may
increase
so
much
so
that
we
may
have
series
of
i
cite
the
example
of
the
decorative
theatrical
artist
who
can
make
the
most
beautiful
images
with
a
few
but
very
characteristic
blots
he
does
it
by
emphasising
what
seems
to
us
characteristic
of
a
rose
arbor
in
such
a
way
that
at
the
distance
and
under
the
conditions
of
illumination
of
the
theatre
we
imagine
we
really
see
a
pretty
rose
arbor
if
the
scene
painter
could
give
definite
rules
he
would
help
us
lawyers
a
great
deal
but
he
has
none
he
proceeds
according
to
experience
and
is
unable
to
correct
whatever
mistakes
he
has
committed
if
the
rose
arbor
fails
to
make
the
right
impression
he
does
not
try
to
improve
it
he
makes
a
new
one
this
may
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
not
all
people
require
the
same
characteristics
in
order
to
identify
a
thing
as
such
so
that
if
we
could
set
the
rose
arbor
on
the
stage
by
itself
only
a
part
of
the
public
would
recognize
it
as
properly
drawn
the
other
part
would
probably
not
recognize
it
at
all
but
if
of
an
evening
there
is
a
large
number
of
decorations
on
the
stage
the
collective
public
will
find
the
arbor
to
be
very
pretty
that
will
be
because
the
human
senses
under
certain
circumstances
are
susceptible
to
sympathetic
induction
in
the
case
of
the
rose
arbor
we
may
assume
that
the
artist
has
typically
represented
the
necessary
characteristics
of
the
arbor
for
one
part
of
the
audience
for
another
part
those
of
a
castle
for
another
part
those
of
a
forest
and
for
a
fourth
those
of
a
background
but
once
an
individual
finds
a
single
object
to
be
correct
his
senses
are
already
sympathetically
inductive
captivated
for
the
correctness
of
the
whole
collection
so
that
the
correctness
passes
from
one
object
to
the
total
number
now
this
psychic
process
is
most
clear
in
those
optical
illusions
which
recently
have
been
much
on
public
exhibition
the
battle
of
gravelotte
the
journey
of
the
austrian
crown
prince
in
egypt
the
chief
trick
of
these
representations
is
the
presenting
of
real
objects
like
stones
wheels
in
the
foreground
in
such
a
way
that
they
fuse
unnoticeably
with
the
painted
picture
the
sense
of
the
spectator
rests
on
the
plastic
objects
is
convinced
of
their
materiality
and
transfers
the
idea
of
this
plasticity
to
the
merely
pictured
thus
the
whole
image
appears
as
the
decorations
of
great
parks
at
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
indicate
that
illumination
and
excited
imagination
are
not
alone
in
causing
such
illusions
weber
tells
ecstatically
of
an
alley
in
schwetzing
at
the
end
of
which
there
was
a
highly
illuminated
concave
wall
painted
with
a
landscape
of
mountains
and
everybody
took
the
deception
for
a
reality
because
the
eye
was
captivated
and
properly
inducted
the
procedure
must
have
been
psychologically
correct
and
must
have
counted
upon
the
weakness
of
our
observation
and
intellection
exner
points
to
the
simple
circumstance
that
we
do
not
want
to
see
that
things
under
certain
conditions
must
terminate
if
we
draw
a
straight
line
and
cover
an
end
with
a
piece
of
paper
every
one
wonders
that
the
line
is
not
longer
when
the
paper
is
removed
i
know
of
no
case
in
criminal
procedure
where
illusions
of
this
kind
might
be
of
importance
but
it
is
conceivable
that
such
illusions
enter
in
numberless
instances
this
is
especially
susceptible
of
observation
when
we
first
see
some
region
or
object
hastily
and
then
observe
it
more
accurately
we
are
astonished
how
fundamentally
false
our
first
conception
was
part
of
this
falseness
may
be
adduced
to
faults
of
memory
but
these
play
little
or
no
part
if
the
time
is
short
and
if
we
are
able
to
recall
that
the
false
conception
appeared
just
as
soon
as
we
observed
the
situation
in
question
the
essential
reason
for
false
conception
is
to
be
found
only
in
the
fact
that
our
first
hasty
view
was
incorrectly
inducted
and
hence
led
to
illusions
like
those
of
the
theatre
thus
it
is
possible
to
take
a
board
fence
covered
at
points
with
green
moss
for
a
rock
and
then
to
be
led
by
this
to
see
a
steep
cliff
certain
shadows
may
so
magnify
the
size
of
the
small
window
of
an
inn
that
we
may
take
it
to
be
as
large
as
that
of
a
sitting
room
and
if
we
have
seen
just
one
window
we
think
all
are
of
the
same
form
and
are
convinced
that
the
inn
is
a
mansion
or
again
we
see
through
the
woods
a
distant
pool
and
in
memory
we
then
see
the
possibly
but
not
necessarily
present
river
or
perhaps
we
see
a
church
spire
and
possibly
near
it
the
roof
of
a
house
rises
above
the
trees
then
we
are
inducted
into
having
seen
a
village
although
there
really
are
visible
only
the
church
and
the
house
these
illusions
again
i
must
repeat
are
of
no
importance
if
they
are
at
all
doubted
for
then
the
truth
is
ascertained
when
however
they
are
not
doubted
and
are
sworn
to
they
cause
the
greatest
confusion
in
trials
a
quarrel
a
swung
cane
and
a
red
handkerchief
on
the
head
are
enough
to
make
people
testify
to
having
seen
a
great
brawl
with
bloody
heads
a
gnawing
rat
a
window
accidentally
left
open
through
the
night
and
some
misplaced
not
instantaneously
discovered
object
are
the
ingredients
of
a
burglary
a
man
who
sees
a
rather
quick
train
hears
a
shrill
blowing
of
the
whistle
and
sees
a
great
cloud
may
think
himself
the
witness
of
a
wreck
all
these
phenomena
moreover
reveal
us
things
as
we
have
been
in
the
habit
of
seeing
them
i
repeat
here
also
that
the
photographic
apparatus
in
so
far
as
it
does
not
possess
a
refracting
lens
shows
things
much
more
truly
than
our
eye
which
is
always
corrected
by
our
memory
if
i
permit
a
man
sitting
on
a
chair
to
be
photographed
front
view
with
his
legs
crossed
and
stretched
far
out
the
result
is
a
ludicrous
picture
because
the
boots
seem
immensely
larger
than
the
head
of
the
subject
but
the
photograph
is
not
at
fault
for
if
the
subject
is
kept
in
the
same
position
and
then
the
apparent
size
of
head
and
boot
are
measured
we
get
accurately
the
same
relation
as
on
the
photograph
we
know
by
experience
how
big
a
head
is
and
hence
we
ordinarily
see
all
relations
of
size
in
proper
proportion
but
on
the
photograph
we
can
not
apply
this
standard
because
it
is
not
given
in
nature
and
we
blame
the
camera
if
in
a
criminal
case
we
are
dealing
with
a
description
of
size
and
it
is
given
as
it
is
known
from
experience
not
as
it
really
appears
then
if
experience
has
deceived
us
our
testimony
is
also
wrong
although
we
pretend
to
have
testified
on
the
basis
of
direct
the
matter
of
probably
because
of
their
short
duration
is
of
no
criminalistic
importance
i
did
once
believe
that
they
might
be
of
considerable
influence
on
the
perception
of
witnesses
but
i
have
not
succeeded
in
discovering
a
single
example
in
which
this
influence
is
perceptible
on
the
other
hand
the
phenomenon
of
irradiation
the
appearance
of
dark
bodies
as
covered
with
rays
of
light
by
adjacent
luminosities
is
of
importance
this
phenomenon
is
as
are
and
explanations
of
it
but
it
is
not
sufficiently
applied
one
needs
only
to
set
a
white
square
upon
the
blackest
possible
ground
and
at
the
same
time
a
similar
black
square
of
equal
size
on
a
white
ground
and
then
to
place
them
under
a
high
light
to
perceive
how
much
larger
the
white
square
appears
to
be
that
such
phenomena
often
occur
in
nature
need
not
be
expounded
whenever
we
are
dealing
with
questions
of
size
it
is
indubitably
necessary
to
consider
the
color
of
the
object
and
its
environment
with
respect
to
its
background
and
to
the
resulting
irradiation
section
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
criminalist
auditory
illusions
are
hardly
less
significant
than
visual
illusions
the
more
so
as
incorrect
hearing
is
much
more
frequent
than
incorrect
seeing
this
is
due
to
the
greater
similarity
of
tones
to
each
other
and
this
similarity
is
due
to
the
fact
that
sound
has
only
one
dimension
while
vision
involves
not
only
three
but
also
color
of
course
between
the
booming
of
cannons
and
the
rustling
of
wings
there
are
more
differences
than
one
but
the
most
various
phenomena
of
tones
may
be
said
to
vary
only
in
degree
for
purposes
of
comparison
moreover
we
can
make
use
only
of
a
class
of
auditory
images
on
the
same
plane
human
voices
etc
real
acoustic
illusions
are
closely
connected
with
auditory
misapprehension
and
a
distinction
between
these
two
can
not
be
rigorously
drawn
a
misapprehension
may
as
a
rule
be
indicated
by
almost
any
external
condition
like
the
relations
of
pitch
echo
repetition
false
coincidence
of
waves
of
sound
etc
under
such
circumstances
there
may
arise
real
illusions
the
study
of
auditory
illusions
is
rendered
especially
difficult
by
the
rarity
of
their
repetition
which
makes
it
impossible
reliably
to
exclude
accidents
and
mistakes
in
observation
only
two
phenomena
are
susceptible
of
accurate
and
sufficient
study
for
three
summers
a
man
used
to
ride
through
the
long
street
in
which
i
live
the
man
used
to
sell
ice
and
would
announce
himself
by
crying
out
with
the
accent
on
the
fro
this
word
was
distinctly
audible
but
if
the
man
came
to
a
definite
place
in
the
street
there
were
also
audible
the
words
if
he
rode
on
further
the
expression
became
confused
and
gradually
turned
into
the
correct
i
observed
this
daily
got
a
number
of
others
to
do
so
without
telling
them
of
the
illusion
but
each
heard
the
same
thing
in
spite
of
the
distinct
difference
between
and
i
made
a
similar
observation
at
a
bicycle
school
as
is
known
beginners
are
able
frequently
to
ride
by
themselves
but
need
help
in
mounting
and
dismounting
their
machines
to
do
so
they
call
a
teacher
by
crying
out
at
a
certain
place
this
sound
would
seem
distinctly
to
be
i
was
at
first
much
surprised
to
hear
people
of
advanced
age
cry
cheerfully
later
i
discovered
what
the
word
really
was
and
acquaintances
whose
attention
i
called
to
the
matter
confirmed
my
observation
such
things
are
not
indifferent
they
show
that
really
very
different
sounds
may
be
mistaken
for
one
another
that
the
test
of
misunderstandings
may
often
lead
to
false
results
since
only
during
the
test
of
an
illusion
are
both
auditor
and
speaker
accurately
in
the
same
position
as
before
finally
these
things
show
that
the
whole
business
of
correcting
some
false
auditions
is
very
difficult
yet
this
work
of
correction
may
be
assumed
to
be
much
more
easy
with
respect
to
hearing
than
with
respect
to
seeing
if
it
is
asserted
that
the
revolver
has
been
seen
somewhere
and
if
it
has
been
known
that
the
sight
was
impossible
it
becomes
just
as
impossible
almost
to
determine
what
the
object
seen
really
was
in
the
rarest
cases
only
will
it
be
something
altogether
similar
a
pistol
most
of
the
time
it
will
be
an
object
which
could
not
be
inferred
from
no
matter
what
combinations
in
hearing
on
the
contrary
if
once
it
is
determined
that
there
has
been
a
false
audition
the
work
of
placing
it
though
difficult
need
not
be
unprofitable
this
work
is
often
compulsory
upon
the
criminalist
who
receives
protocols
which
have
not
been
read
aloud
and
in
which
mistakes
of
hearing
and
dictation
have
been
made
such
mistakes
are
considerably
disturbing
and
if
the
case
is
important
their
source
and
status
must
be
inferred
this
may
almost
always
be
done
of
course
strange
badly
heard
proper
names
can
not
be
corrected
but
other
things
can
as
regards
the
general
treatment
of
auditory
illusions
it
is
necessary
first
of
all
to
consider
their
many
and
significant
differences
in
the
first
place
there
are
the
varieties
of
good
hearing
that
normal
and
abnormal
hearers
vary
in
degree
of
power
is
well
known
there
are
also
several
special
conditions
causing
the
so
called
who
hear
more
acutely
than
normal
people
of
course
such
assertions
as
those
which
cite
people
who
can
hear
the
noise
of
sulphur
rubbed
on
the
poles
of
quartz
crystals
and
so
on
are
incorrect
but
it
is
certain
that
a
little
attention
will
reveal
a
surprising
number
of
people
whose
hearing
is
far
acuter
than
that
of
normal
individuals
apart
from
children
the
class
is
made
up
of
musicians
of
young
girls
and
of
very
nervous
excitable
and
sickly
persons
the
musicians
in
fact
have
become
so
because
of
their
ears
the
young
girls
hear
well
largely
because
of
their
delicate
organization
and
the
very
fine
construction
of
their
ears
and
the
nervous
people
because
of
their
sensibility
to
the
pain
involved
in
loud
noises
many
differences
of
perception
among
witnesses
are
to
be
explained
by
differences
of
audition
and
the
reality
of
apparent
impossibilities
in
hearing
must
not
be
denied
but
must
be
tested
under
proper
conditions
one
of
these
conditions
is
location
the
difference
between
hearing
things
in
the
noisy
day
and
in
the
quiet
night
in
the
roar
of
the
city
or
in
the
quiet
of
the
mountains
is
familiar
the
influence
of
resonance
and
pitch
echo
and
absorption
of
tones
the
location
of
the
sound
is
of
great
importance
finally
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
ability
to
hear
varies
with
the
weather
colds
reduce
the
power
and
not
a
few
people
are
influenced
by
temperature
atmospheric
pressure
etc
these
considerations
show
the
degree
in
which
auditory
illusions
can
be
of
importance
even
in
tests
of
their
nature
and
existence
they
show
above
all
that
the
same
object
of
comparison
under
the
same
circumstances
must
be
used
in
every
test
otherwise
much
confusion
inevitably
results
the
presence
of
auditory
illusions
in
diseases
fever
hysteria
nervousness
alcoholism
and
its
associates
mental
disturbances
hyper√¶mia
diseases
of
the
ear
is
well
known
but
concerns
us
only
as
pointing
to
the
necessity
of
calling
in
the
physician
immediately
they
have
their
definite
characteristics
and
rarely
leave
the
layman
in
doubt
of
his
duty
in
that
direction
the
great
difficulty
comes
in
dealing
with
diseases
or
apparent
diseases
while
it
is
still
impossible
to
know
of
their
existence
or
where
the
pain
is
of
such
character
that
the
layman
does
not
know
of
its
presence
and
thus
has
no
ground
for
consulting
the
doctor
for
example
it
is
well
known
that
a
large
amount
of
ear
wax
in
the
aural
passage
may
cause
all
sorts
of
ringing
and
sighing
in
the
ear
and
may
even
produce
real
hallucinations
yet
a
person
having
an
abnormal
amount
of
ear
wax
may
be
otherwise
absolutely
sound
how
is
the
need
of
a
physician
to
be
guessed
in
such
a
case
again
the
perforation
of
the
drum
especially
when
it
follows
a
catarrh
may
cause
a
definite
auditory
illusion
with
regard
to
the
sound
of
voices
or
the
illusion
may
be
effected
by
the
irritation
of
the
skin
in
the
ear
passage
or
by
anemia
or
by
a
strong
carotid
pulse
and
a
distention
of
the
bloodvessels
as
happens
in
alcoholism
many
people
become
abnormally
sensitive
to
sound
at
the
beginning
of
fevers
women
at
the
time
of
their
climacterium
hear
all
kinds
of
voices
inasmuch
as
this
soon
stops
the
abnormality
and
incorrectness
of
their
audition
is
hard
to
establish
childbirth
too
makes
a
difference
old
otherwise
conscientious
midwives
claim
to
have
heard
unborn
children
breathe
and
cry
examples
of
this
sort
of
thing
are
innumerable
and
they
teach
that
whenever
any
questionable
assertion
is
made
about
a
thing
heard
the
doctor
must
be
called
in
to
determine
whether
the
witness
heard
it
under
abnormal
though
not
diseased
conditions
again
merely
accidental
or
habitual
general
excitability
tends
to
intensify
all
sounds
and
whether
the
witness
under
consideration
was
in
such
condition
can
be
determined
only
by
the
expert
physician
the
illusions
of
hearing
which
completely
normal
people
are
subject
to
are
the
most
difficult
of
all
their
number
and
frequency
is
variously
estimated
the
physician
has
nothing
to
do
with
them
the
physicist
the
acoustician
and
physiologist
do
not
care
about
the
needs
in
this
matter
and
we
ourselves
rarely
have
time
and
opportunity
to
deal
with
it
as
a
result
our
information
is
very
small
and
no
one
can
say
how
much
is
still
undiscovered
one
of
my
friends
has
called
my
attention
to
the
fact
that
when
the
beats
of
the
clock
are
counted
during
sleepiness
one
too
many
is
regularly
counted
i
tested
this
observation
and
my
experience
confirmed
it
if
now
we
consider
how
frequently
the
determination
of
time
makes
the
whole
difference
in
a
criminal
case
and
how
easily
it
is
possible
to
mistake
a
whole
hour
we
can
get
some
notion
of
the
importance
of
this
illusion
its
explanation
is
difficult
and
it
may
be
merely
a
single
instance
of
a
whole
series
of
unknown
auditory
illusions
resting
on
the
same
basis
another
and
similar
phenomenon
is
the
beat
of
the
if
you
have
an
assistant
strike
the
table
with
a
hammer
while
you
hold
both
ears
with
your
fingers
and
then
open
them
half
a
second
or
a
second
after
the
blow
you
hear
the
blow
again
and
if
you
open
and
shut
your
ears
quickly
you
can
hear
the
blow
several
times
this
is
explained
through
the
fact
that
a
number
of
reflections
of
the
sound
occur
in
the
room
and
that
these
are
perceivable
only
by
the
unfatigued
ear
the
explanation
is
unsatisfactory
because
the
experiment
is
sometimes
successful
in
the
open
taken
in
itself
this
matter
seems
very
theoretical
and
without
practical
value
but
this
kind
of
action
may
occur
automatically
it
is
well
known
that
swallowing
closes
the
eustachian
tubes
for
a
moment
especially
if
done
when
lying
down
now
if
this
occurs
during
a
blow
a
shot
the
sound
must
be
heard
twice
again
it
may
easily
happen
that
because
of
the
noise
a
man
wakes
up
half
asleep
and
frightened
swallows
the
collected
saliva
then
this
accident
which
in
itself
seems
unimportant
may
lead
to
very
significant
testimony
such
occurrences
are
not
infrequent
the
intensity
of
a
sound
already
heard
may
be
of
considerable
influence
certain
experimenters
have
indicated
the
remarkable
character
of
slightly
intensive
effects
of
sound
if
you
hold
a
watch
so
far
from
the
ear
as
to
hear
it
clearly
but
weakly
the
sound
decreases
until
finally
it
is
not
heard
at
all
and
after
awhile
it
is
again
heard
etc
this
may
lead
to
hearing
distinct
sounds
made
up
of
many
tones
and
need
not
evince
any
great
illusion
with
regard
to
the
ticking
of
a
watch
but
the
thing
may
occur
also
in
connection
with
more
powerful
and
more
distant
sounds
the
murmur
of
a
brook
the
rush
of
a
train
the
pounding
in
a
distant
factory
noises
far
removed
are
influenced
by
reflections
of
sound
waves
of
air
and
it
is
possible
that
all
kinds
of
things
may
be
heard
in
a
completely
monotonous
noise
this
can
be
easily
learned
by
listening
to
the
soft
murmur
of
a
distant
brook
at
night
given
the
disposition
and
supposing
the
existence
of
the
brook
unknown
it
is
easy
to
hear
in
its
monotonous
murmur
human
voices
sighs
shrieks
etc
another
remarkable
observation
shows
that
in
the
dark
very
distinct
things
are
heard
during
the
playing
of
delicate
instruments
such
as
the
humming
approaches
and
withdraws
then
it
comes
on
various
sides
and
finally
one
has
the
feeling
that
the
whole
room
is
full
of
humming
and
winging
insects
and
this
may
go
on
indefinitely
there
is
a
large
collection
of
reasons
for
this
reduplication
of
monotonous
sounds
everybody
knows
the
accord
of
the
√¶olian
harp
which
consists
of
identical
notes
and
the
melodies
which
seem
to
lie
in
the
pounding
of
the
train
on
the
rails
this
can
become
especially
clear
when
one
is
half
asleep
if
ever
thinking
begins
to
be
ousted
by
slumber
the
rhythmic
pound
begins
to
dominate
consciousness
then
the
rhythm
gets
its
appropriate
melody
which
becomes
progressively
more
intense
and
if
one
grows
suddenly
wide
awake
one
wonders
why
the
music
is
missing
similarly
it
is
often
asserted
that
a
row
of
travelling
wild
swans
make
pleasant
chords
although
each
swan
is
able
to
utter
only
one
cry
difference
in
distance
and
alterations
in
the
air
cause
the
chords
the
difficulties
in
distinguishing
the
intensity
or
weakness
of
a
sound
are
of
importance
fechner
learned
from
the
violinist
wasilewski
that
he
observed
that
a
male
choir
of
four
hundred
voices
did
not
sound
essentially
louder
than
one
of
two
hundred
at
the
same
time
one
clock
is
not
heard
at
a
great
distance
a
hundred
clocks
are
heard
one
locust
can
not
be
heard
eating
when
eat
they
are
heard
hence
each
one
must
make
a
definite
noise
early
authorities
have
already
indicated
how
difficult
it
is
to
distinguish
the
number
of
bells
ringing
together
even
musicians
will
often
take
two
or
three
to
be
five
or
six
certain
dispositions
make
some
difference
in
this
respect
the
operating
physician
hears
the
low
groaning
of
the
patient
after
the
operation
without
having
heard
his
loud
cries
during
the
operation
during
the
operation
the
physician
must
not
hear
anything
that
is
likely
to
disturb
his
work
but
the
low
groan
has
simply
borne
in
upon
him
the
sleeping
mother
often
is
deaf
to
considerable
noise
but
wakes
up
immediately
when
her
child
draws
a
deeper
breath
than
usual
millers
and
factory
hands
travellers
do
not
hear
the
pounding
of
their
various
habitual
environmental
noises
but
they
perceive
the
slightest
call
and
everybody
observes
the
considerable
murmur
of
the
world
the
sum
of
all
distant
noises
only
in
the
silence
of
the
night
that
misses
it
illusions
of
direction
of
sound
are
very
common
it
is
said
that
even
animals
are
subject
to
them
and
everybody
knows
how
few
human
beings
can
distinguish
the
source
and
direction
of
street
music
a
rolling
wagon
or
a
ringing
bell
even
when
long
practice
enables
one
to
determine
direction
with
correctness
an
accidental
event
perhaps
the
weather
especial
sounds
a
different
grouping
of
individuals
on
the
street
may
result
in
serious
mistakes
i
tried
to
learn
to
judge
from
my
whether
the
ring
of
the
came
from
above
or
below
i
succeeded
so
well
that
i
could
not
understand
how
it
was
difficult
not
to
learn
the
difference
and
yet
i
failed
many
a
time
altogether
in
judgment
the
reason
for
it
i
do
not
know
all
these
enumerated
circumstances
must
show
how
very
uncertain
all
acoustic
perceptions
are
and
how
little
they
may
be
trusted
if
they
are
not
carefully
tested
under
similar
conditions
and
if
what
is
most
important
they
are
not
isolated
we
are
here
led
back
to
the
old
principle
that
every
observation
is
not
proof
but
means
of
proof
and
that
it
may
be
trusted
only
when
it
is
confirmed
by
many
parallel
actions
which
are
really
consistent
that
even
after
that
mistakes
are
possible
is
true
but
is
when
we
have
done
all
that
lies
within
human
power
section
of
the
high
standing
of
the
sense
of
touch
which
make
it
in
certain
directions
even
the
organ
of
control
of
the
sense
of
sight
is
well
known
and
historic
attempt
to
derive
all
the
senses
from
this
one
is
still
plausible
if
what
is
seen
is
to
be
seen
accurately
there
is
automatic
resort
to
the
confirmatory
aid
of
the
sense
of
touch
which
apprehends
what
the
eye
has
missed
hence
we
find
many
people
touching
things
whose
vision
is
not
altogether
reliable
people
of
considerable
age
children
unpracticed
in
seeing
an
uneducated
people
who
have
never
learned
to
see
quickly
and
comprehensively
moreover
certain
things
can
be
determined
only
by
touching
the
fineness
of
papers
cloth
the
sharpness
or
pointedness
of
instruments
or
the
rawness
of
objects
even
when
we
pat
a
dog
kindly
we
do
so
partly
because
we
want
to
see
whether
his
skin
is
as
smooth
and
fine
as
the
eye
sees
it
moreover
we
want
to
test
the
visual
impression
by
that
of
touch
but
important
and
reliable
as
the
sense
of
touch
is
it
is
nevertheless
not
to
be
trusted
when
it
is
the
sole
instrument
of
perception
we
must
never
depend
on
the
testimony
of
a
witness
based
entirely
on
perceptions
by
touch
and
the
statements
of
a
wounded
person
concerning
the
time
manner
of
his
wound
are
unreliable
unless
he
has
also
seen
what
he
has
felt
we
know
that
most
knife
and
bullet
wounds
the
most
dangerous
ones
are
felt
in
the
first
instance
as
not
very
powerful
blows
blows
on
the
extremities
are
not
felt
as
such
but
rather
as
pain
and
blows
on
the
head
are
regularly
estimated
in
terms
of
pain
and
falsely
with
regard
to
their
strength
if
they
were
powerful
enough
to
cause
unconsciousness
they
are
said
to
have
been
very
massive
but
if
they
have
not
had
that
effect
they
will
be
described
by
the
most
honest
of
witnesses
as
much
more
powerful
than
they
actually
were
concerning
the
location
of
a
wound
in
the
back
in
the
side
even
in
the
upper
arm
the
wounded
person
can
give
only
general
indications
and
if
he
correctly
indicates
the
seat
of
the
wound
he
has
learned
it
later
but
did
not
know
it
when
it
occurred
according
to
helmholtz
practically
all
abdominal
sensations
are
attributed
to
the
anterior
abdominal
wall
now
such
matters
become
of
importance
when
an
individual
has
suffered
several
wounds
in
a
brawl
or
an
assault
and
wants
to
say
certainly
that
he
got
wound
a
when
x
appeared
wound
b
when
y
struck
at
him
etc
these
assertions
are
almost
all
false
because
the
victim
is
likely
to
identify
the
pain
of
the
moment
of
receiving
the
wound
with
its
later
painfulness
if
for
example
an
individual
has
received
a
rather
long
but
shallow
knife
wound
and
a
deep
stab
in
the
back
the
first
will
cause
him
very
considerable
burning
sensation
the
latter
only
the
feeling
of
a
heavy
blow
later
on
at
the
examination
the
cut
has
healed
and
is
no
longer
painful
the
dangerous
stab
which
may
have
reached
the
lung
causes
pain
and
great
difficulty
in
breathing
so
that
the
wounded
man
assigns
the
incidence
of
the
stab
to
the
painful
sensation
of
the
cut
and
conversely
various
perceptions
of
victims
on
receiving
a
wound
are
remarkable
and
i
have
persuaded
a
police
surgeon
of
considerable
learning
and
originality
to
collect
and
interpret
his
great
mass
of
material
it
is
best
done
by
means
of
tabulation
accurate
description
of
wounds
according
to
their
place
size
form
and
significance
the
statement
of
the
victim
concerning
his
feeling
at
the
moment
of
receiving
the
wound
the
consequences
of
healing
and
at
the
end
explanatory
observations
concerning
the
reasons
for
true
or
incorrect
sensations
of
the
victim
as
this
work
is
to
have
only
psychological
value
it
is
indifferent
whether
the
victim
is
veracious
or
not
what
we
want
to
know
is
what
people
say
about
their
perception
the
true
and
the
false
will
distinguish
themselves
automatically
the
material
being
so
rich
and
the
object
will
be
to
compare
true
subjective
feelings
with
true
subjective
deeds
perhaps
it
may
even
be
possible
to
draw
generalizations
and
to
abstract
certain
rules
there
are
many
examples
of
the
fact
that
uncontrolled
touch
leads
to
false
perceptions
modern
psychophysics
has
pointed
to
a
large
group
of
false
perceptions
due
to
illusions
of
pressure
stabs
or
other
contact
with
the
skin
the
best
known
and
criminalistically
most
important
experiments
are
those
with
open
compasses
pressed
on
the
less
sensitive
parts
of
the
body
the
back
the
thigh
they
are
always
felt
as
one
although
they
are
quite
far
apart
the
experiments
of
flournoy
again
show
how
difficult
it
is
to
judge
weights
which
are
not
helped
by
the
appreciation
of
their
form
and
appearance
ten
objects
of
various
forms
were
judged
by
fifty
people
for
their
weight
only
one
discovered
that
they
all
had
the
same
weight
similarly
mere
touch
can
not
give
us
proper
control
over
the
organs
of
the
body
sully
says
that
in
bed
we
may
voluntarily
imagine
that
a
leg
has
a
position
quite
different
from
that
it
really
has
let
me
cite
some
similar
examples
from
my
for
investigating
if
we
take
a
pea
between
the
thumb
and
the
index
finger
we
feel
the
pea
simply
although
its
tactile
image
comes
to
us
through
two
fingers
double
if
now
we
cross
the
third
finger
over
the
fourth
and
hold
the
pea
between
the
ends
of
these
two
fingers
we
feel
it
to
be
double
because
the
fingers
are
not
in
their
customary
positions
and
hence
give
double
results
from
one
point
of
view
this
double
feeling
is
correct
but
when
we
touch
the
pea
naturally
experience
helps
us
to
feel
only
one
pea
another
example
consists
in
crossing
the
hands
and
turning
them
inward
and
upward
so
that
the
left
fingers
turn
to
the
left
and
the
right
fingers
to
the
right
here
the
localization
of
the
fingers
is
totally
lost
and
if
a
second
person
points
to
one
of
the
fingers
without
touching
it
asking
you
to
lift
it
you
regularly
lift
the
analogous
finger
of
the
other
hand
this
shows
that
the
tactile
sense
is
not
in
a
very
high
stage
of
development
since
it
needs
when
unhelped
by
long
experience
the
assistance
of
the
sense
of
sight
perceptions
through
touch
alone
therefore
are
of
small
importance
inferences
are
made
on
the
basis
of
few
and
more
coarse
characteristic
impressions
this
is
shown
by
a
youthful
game
we
used
to
play
it
consisted
of
stretching
certain
harmless
things
under
the
table
a
soft
piece
of
dough
a
peeled
damp
potato
stuck
on
a
bit
of
wood
a
wet
glove
filled
with
sand
the
spirally
cut
rind
of
a
beet
etc
whoever
got
one
of
these
objects
without
seeing
it
thought
he
was
holding
some
disgusting
thing
and
threw
it
away
his
sense
of
touch
could
present
only
the
dampness
the
coldness
and
the
motion
the
coarsest
traits
of
reptilian
life
and
the
imagination
built
these
up
into
a
reptile
and
caused
the
consequent
action
foolish
as
this
game
seems
it
is
criminalistically
instructive
it
indicates
what
unbelievable
illusions
the
sense
of
touch
is
capable
of
causing
to
this
inadequacy
of
the
tactile
imagination
may
be
added
a
sort
of
transferability
of
certain
touch
sensations
for
example
if
ants
are
busy
near
my
seat
i
immediately
feel
that
ants
are
running
about
under
my
clothes
and
if
i
see
a
wound
or
hear
it
described
i
often
feel
pain
in
the
analogous
place
on
my
own
body
that
this
may
lead
to
considerable
illusion
in
excitable
witnesses
is
obvious
finally
this
dependence
of
the
sense
of
touch
may
be
supplemented
by
the
fact
that
it
is
counted
only
relatively
and
its
value
varies
with
the
individual
we
find
the
cellar
warm
in
winter
and
cold
in
summer
because
we
only
feel
the
difference
with
the
outer
air
and
when
we
put
one
hand
in
hot
and
the
other
in
cold
water
and
then
put
both
in
tepid
water
one
finds
the
tepid
water
cold
the
other
warm
the
record
of
tactile
sensations
is
frequent
in
our
protocols
and
requires
constant
consideration
of
the
unreliability
diseased
conditions
are
of
course
to
be
referred
to
the
physician
i
need
only
mention
that
slight
poisonings
by
means
of
chloroform
morphine
atropine
daturine
decrease
and
that
strychnine
increases
the
sensitivity
of
the
touch
organ
section
of
the
sense
of
illusions
of
taste
are
of
importance
for
us
only
in
cases
of
poisoning
in
which
we
want
the
assistance
of
the
victim
or
desire
to
taste
the
poison
in
question
in
order
to
determine
its
nature
that
taste
and
odor
are
particularly
difficult
to
get
any
unanimity
about
is
an
old
story
and
it
follows
that
it
is
still
more
difficult
clearly
to
understand
possible
illusions
of
these
senses
that
disease
can
cause
mistaken
gustatory
impressions
is
well
known
but
precedent
poisoning
may
also
create
illusions
thus
observation
shows
that
poisoning
by
that
worm
remedy
to
which
children
are
so
abnormally
sensitive
causes
a
bitter
taste
morphine
poisoning
causes
illusory
bitter
and
sour
tastes
intermittent
fevers
tend
to
cause
when
there
is
no
attack
and
the
patient
feels
comparatively
well
a
large
number
of
metallic
particularly
coppery
tastes
if
this
is
true
it
may
lead
to
unjustified
suspicions
of
poisoning
inasmuch
as
the
phenomena
of
intermittent
fever
are
so
various
that
they
can
not
all
be
identified
imagination
makes
considerable
difference
here
taine
tells
somewhere
of
a
novelist
who
so
graphically
described
the
poisoning
of
his
heroine
that
he
felt
the
taste
of
arsenic
and
got
indigestion
this
may
be
possible
for
perhaps
everybody
has
already
learned
the
great
influence
of
the
false
idea
of
the
nature
of
a
food
if
some
salt
meat
is
taken
to
be
a
sweet
pastry
the
taste
becomes
disgusting
because
the
imaginary
and
the
actual
tastes
seem
to
be
mixed
the
eye
has
especial
influence
and
the
story
cited
and
denied
a
hundred
times
that
in
the
dark
red
wine
and
white
wine
chicken
and
goose
can
not
be
distinguished
that
the
going
out
of
a
cigar
is
not
noted
is
true
with
your
eyes
closed
it
may
be
possible
to
eat
an
onion
instead
of
an
apple
prior
tastes
may
cause
significant
gustatory
illusions
hence
when
assertions
are
made
about
tastes
it
is
always
necessary
to
inquire
at
the
outset
what
had
been
eaten
or
drunk
before
experienced
housewives
take
this
fact
into
consideration
in
setting
their
tables
and
arranging
their
wines
the
values
of
the
wines
are
considerably
raised
by
complete
illusions
of
taste
all
in
all
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
reliability
of
the
sense
of
taste
can
not
be
estimated
too
low
the
illusions
are
greatest
especially
when
a
thing
has
been
tasted
with
a
preconceived
notion
of
its
taste
section
illusions
of
the
olfactory
olfactory
illusions
are
very
rare
in
healthy
people
and
are
hence
of
small
importance
they
are
frequent
among
the
mentally
diseased
are
connected
in
most
cases
with
sexual
conditions
and
then
are
so
vivid
that
the
judge
can
hardly
doubt
the
need
of
calling
in
the
physician
certain
poisons
tend
to
debauch
the
olfactory
sense
strychnine
tends
to
make
it
finer
morphine
duller
people
with
weak
lungs
try
in
most
cases
to
set
their
difficulty
of
breathing
outside
themselves
and
believe
that
they
are
inhaling
poisoned
air
etc
if
one
considers
in
this
connection
the
suspiciousness
which
many
people
suffering
from
lung
trouble
often
exhibit
we
may
explain
many
groundless
accusations
of
attempted
murder
by
stifling
with
poisonous
or
unbreathable
gas
if
this
typical
illusion
is
unknown
to
the
judge
he
may
find
no
reason
for
calling
in
the
physician
and
then
injustice
the
largest
number
of
olfactory
illusions
are
due
to
imagination
frequently
cited
case
of
the
officials
who
smelled
a
corpse
while
a
coffin
was
being
dug
up
until
finally
the
coffin
was
found
to
be
empty
has
many
fellows
i
once
was
making
an
examination
of
a
case
of
arson
and
on
approaching
the
village
noted
a
characteristic
odor
which
is
spread
by
burned
animals
or
men
when
we
learned
that
the
consumed
farm
lay
still
an
ride
from
the
village
the
odor
immediately
disappeared
again
on
returning
home
i
thought
i
heard
the
voice
of
a
visitor
and
immediately
smelled
her
characteristic
perfume
but
she
had
not
been
there
that
day
such
illusions
are
to
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
many
odors
are
in
the
air
that
they
are
not
very
powerfully
differentiated
and
may
hence
be
turned
by
means
of
the
imagination
into
that
one
which
is
likely
to
be
most
obvious
the
stories
told
of
who
think
they
are
able
to
smell
the
pole
of
a
magnet
or
the
chemicals
melted
into
a
glass
belong
to
this
class
that
they
do
so
in
good
faith
may
be
assumed
but
to
smell
through
melted
glass
is
impossible
hence
it
must
be
believed
that
such
people
have
really
smelled
something
somewhere
and
have
given
this
odor
this
or
that
particular
location
something
like
this
occurs
when
an
odor
otherwise
found
pleasant
suddenly
becomes
disgusting
and
unbearable
when
its
source
is
unknown
however
gladly
a
man
may
eat
sardines
in
oil
he
is
likely
to
turn
aside
when
his
eyes
are
closed
and
an
open
can
of
sardines
is
held
under
his
nose
many
delicate
forms
of
cheese
emit
disgusting
odors
so
long
as
it
is
not
known
that
cheese
is
the
source
the
odor
that
issues
from
the
hands
after
crabs
have
been
eaten
is
unbearable
if
however
one
bears
in
mind
that
the
odor
is
the
odor
of
crabs
it
becomes
not
at
all
so
unpleasant
association
has
much
influence
for
a
long
time
i
disliked
to
go
to
a
market
where
flowers
bouquets
wreaths
were
kept
because
i
smelled
dead
human
bodies
finally
i
discovered
that
the
odor
was
due
to
the
fact
that
i
knew
most
of
these
flowers
to
be
such
as
are
laid
on
coffins
are
smelled
during
interment
again
many
people
find
perfumes
good
or
bad
as
they
like
or
dislike
the
person
who
makes
use
of
them
and
the
judgment
concerning
the
pleasantness
or
unpleasantness
of
an
odor
is
mainly
dependent
upon
the
pleasantness
or
unpleasantness
of
associative
memories
when
my
son
who
is
naturally
a
vegetarian
and
who
could
never
be
moved
to
eat
meat
became
a
doctor
i
thought
that
he
could
never
be
brought
to
endure
the
odor
of
the
dissecting
room
it
did
not
disturb
him
in
the
least
however
and
he
explained
it
by
saying
do
not
eat
what
smells
like
that
and
i
can
not
conceive
how
you
can
eat
anything
from
the
butcher
shops
where
the
odor
is
exactly
like
that
of
the
dissecting
what
odor
is
called
good
or
bad
ecstatic
or
disgusting
is
purely
a
subjective
matter
and
never
to
be
the
basis
of
a
universal
judgment
statements
by
witnesses
concerning
perceptions
of
odor
are
valueless
unless
otherwise
confirmed
section
b
hallucinations
and
illusions
the
limits
between
illusions
of
sense
and
hallucinations
and
illusions
proper
can
in
no
sense
be
definitely
determined
inasmuch
as
any
phenomena
of
the
one
may
be
applied
to
the
other
and
vice
versa
most
safely
it
may
be
held
that
the
cause
of
illusions
of
sense
lies
in
the
nature
of
while
the
hallucinations
and
illusions
are
due
to
the
activity
of
the
brain
the
latter
are
much
more
likely
to
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
physician
than
but
at
the
same
time
many
of
them
have
to
be
determined
upon
by
the
lawyer
inasmuch
as
they
really
occur
to
normal
people
or
to
such
whose
disease
is
just
beginning
so
that
the
physician
can
not
yet
reach
it
nevertheless
whenever
the
lawyer
finds
himself
face
to
face
with
a
supposed
illusion
or
hallucination
he
must
absolutely
call
in
the
physician
for
as
rarely
as
an
ordinary
illusion
of
sense
is
explicable
by
the
rules
of
logic
or
psychology
or
even
by
means
of
other
knowledge
or
experience
at
the
command
of
any
educated
man
so
frequently
do
processes
occur
in
cases
of
hallucination
and
illusion
which
require
at
the
very
least
the
physiological
knowledge
of
the
physician
our
activity
must
hence
be
limited
to
the
perception
of
the
presence
of
hallucination
or
illusion
the
rest
is
matter
for
the
psychiatrist
small
as
our
concern
is
it
is
important
and
difficult
for
on
the
one
hand
we
must
not
appeal
to
the
physician
about
every
stupid
fancy
or
every
lie
a
prisoner
utters
and
on
the
other
hand
we
assume
a
heavy
responsibility
if
we
interpret
a
real
hallucination
or
illusion
as
a
true
and
real
observation
to
acquire
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
these
things
therefore
can
not
be
rigorously
enough
recommended
hallucination
and
illusion
have
been
distinguished
by
the
fact
that
hallucination
implies
no
external
object
whatever
while
in
illusion
objects
are
mistaken
and
misinterpreted
when
one
thing
is
taken
for
another
an
oven
for
a
man
the
rustle
of
the
wind
for
a
human
song
we
have
illusion
when
no
objective
existence
is
perceived
when
a
man
is
seen
to
enter
a
voice
is
heard
a
touch
is
felt
although
nothing
whatever
has
happened
we
have
hallucination
illusion
is
partial
hallucination
complete
supplementation
of
an
external
object
there
is
not
a
correct
and
definite
difference
between
illusion
and
hallucination
inasmuch
as
what
is
present
may
be
so
remotely
connected
with
what
is
perceived
that
it
is
no
more
than
a
stimulus
and
thus
illusion
may
be
turned
into
real
hallucination
one
authority
calls
illusion
the
conception
of
an
actually
present
external
event
which
is
perceived
by
the
peripheral
organs
in
the
form
of
an
idea
that
does
not
coincide
with
the
event
the
mistake
does
not
lie
in
the
defective
activity
of
the
senses
so
much
as
in
the
fact
that
an
apperceptive
idea
is
substituted
for
the
perceptive
view
in
hallucination
every
external
event
is
absent
and
hence
what
is
seen
is
due
to
a
stimulation
of
the
periphery
some
authorities
believe
hallucination
to
be
caused
by
cramp
of
the
sensory
nerve
others
find
illusions
to
be
an
externally
stimulated
not
corresponding
to
the
stimulus
and
still
others
believe
it
to
be
essentially
normal
most
human
beings
are
from
time
to
time
subject
to
illusions
indeed
nobody
is
always
sober
and
intelligent
in
all
his
perceptions
and
convictions
the
luminous
center
of
our
intelligent
perceptions
is
wrapped
in
a
cloudy
of
illusion
sully
aims
to
distinguish
the
essential
nature
of
illusion
from
that
characterized
by
ordinary
language
illusion
according
to
him
is
often
used
to
denote
mistakes
which
do
not
imply
untrue
perceptions
we
say
a
man
has
an
illusion
who
thinks
too
much
of
himself
or
when
he
tells
stories
otherwise
than
as
they
happen
because
of
a
weakness
of
memory
illusion
is
every
form
of
mistake
which
substitutes
any
direct
or
intuitive
knowledge
whether
as
or
as
any
other
form
nowadays
the
cause
of
hallucination
and
illusion
is
sought
in
the
of
the
system
as
this
stimulation
may
be
very
various
in
its
intensity
and
significance
from
the
momentary
rush
of
blood
to
complete
lunacy
so
hallucinations
and
illusions
may
be
insignificant
or
signs
of
very
serious
mental
disturbances
when
we
seek
the
form
of
these
phenomena
we
find
that
all
those
psychical
events
belong
to
it
which
have
not
been
performed
or
lied
about
when
brutus
sees
ghost
macbeth
ghost
nicholas
his
son
these
are
distinctly
hallucinations
or
illusions
of
the
same
kind
as
those
and
seen
by
our
nurses
the
stories
of
such
people
have
no
significance
for
the
criminalist
but
if
a
person
has
seen
an
entering
thief
an
escaping
murderer
a
bloody
corpse
or
some
similar
object
of
criminal
law
and
these
are
hallucinations
like
classical
ghosts
then
are
we
likely
to
be
much
deceived
hoppe
enumerates
hallucinations
of
apparently
sound
people
a
priest

by
mental
exertion

while
he

over

he

he
was

he
would
fall
a
man
who
had
seen
an
enormous
fire
for
a
long
time
afterward
saw
flames
continually
numerous
cases
in
which
criminals
especially
murderers
always
had
their
victims

their
eyes
justus
m√∂ser
saw
flowers

knows
a
man
who

eyes
a
man
got
a
wound
in
his
left
ear
and
for
weeks
afterward
saw
a
cat
a
woman
years
old
often
saw
everything
covered
with
flowers
otherwise
she
was
quite
a
part
of
these
stories
seems
considerably
fictitious
a
part
applies
to
indubitable
pathological
cases
and
certain
of
them
are
confirmed
elsewhere
that
murderers
particularly
of
children
often
see
their
victims
is
well
known
to
us
criminalists
and
for
this
reason
the
habit
of
confining
prisoners
in
a
dark
cell
for
hours
on
the
anniversary
of
a
crime
must
be
pointed
to
as
refined
and
thoroughly
medi√¶val
cruelty
i
have
repeatedly
heard
from
people
so
tortured
of
the
terror
of
their
visions
on
such
days
of
martyrdom
cases
are
told
of
in
which
prisoners
who
were
constipated
had
all
kinds
of
visual
and
auditory
hallucinations
and
appeared
to
hear
in
the
rustling
of
their
straw
all
sorts
of
words
that
isolation
predisposes
people
to
such
things
is
as
well
known
as
the
fact
that
constipation
causes
a
rush
of
blood
to
the
head
and
hence
nervous
excitement
the
stories
of
robbers
which
are
often
told
us
by
prisoners
are
not
always
the
fruit
of
malicious
invention
probably
a
not
insignificant
portion
are
the
result
of
hallucination
hoppe
tells
of
a
great
group
of
hallucinations
in
conditions
of
waking
and
and
asserts
that
everybody
has
them
and
can
note
them
if
he
gives
his
attention
thereto
this
may
be
an
exaggeration
but
it
is
true
that
a
healthy
person
in
any
way
excited
or
afraid
may
hear
all
kinds
of
things
in
the
crackling
of
a
fire
and
may
see
all
kinds
of
things
in
smoke
in
clouds
etc
the
movement
of
portraits
and
statues
is
particularly
characteristic
especially
in
dim
light
and
under
unstable
emotional
conditions
i
own
a
relief
by
ghiberti
called
the
of
the
flesh
in
which
seven
lemurs
dance
around
a
corpse
and
sing
if
at
night
i
put
out
the
lamp
in
my
study
and
the
moon
falls
on
the
work
the
seven
lemurs
dance
as
lively
as
may
be
during
the
time
it
takes
my
eyes
to
adapt
themselves
from
the
lamplight
to
the
moonlight
something
similar
i
see
on
an
old
carved
dresser
the
carving
is
so
delicate
that
in
dim
light
it
shows
tiny
heads
and
flames
after
the
fashion
of
the
catholic
church
pictures
of
souls
in
purgatory
under
certain
conditions
of
illumination
the
flames
flicker
the
heads
move
and
out
of
the
fire
the
arms
raise
themselves
to
the
clouds
floating
above
now
this
requires
no
unusual
excitement
simply
the
weary
sensing
of
evening
when
the
eyes
turn
from
prolonged
uniform
reading
or
writing
to
something
else
it
has
happened
to
me
from
my
earliest
childhood
high
bodily
temperature
may
easily
cause
hallucinations
thus
marching
soldiers
are
led
to
shoot
at
nonexisting
animals
and
enemies
uniform
and
fatiguing
mental
activity
is
also
a
source
of
hallucination
fechner
says
that
one
day
having
performed
a
long
experiment
with
the
help
of
a
he
heard
its
beats
through
the
whole
evening
after
so
again
when
he
was
studying
long
series
of
figures
he
used
to
see
them
at
night
in
the
dark
so
distinctly
that
he
could
read
them
off
then
there
are
illusions
of
touch
which
may
be
criminalistically
important
a
movement
of
air
may
be
taken
for
an
approaching
man
a
tight
collar
or
cravat
may
excite
the
image
of
being
stifled
old
people
frequently
have
a
sandy
taste
while
eating
when
this
is
told
the
thought
occurs
that
it
may
be
due
to
coarsely
powdered
arsenic
yet
it
may
be
merely
illusion
the
slightest
abnormality
makes
hallucinations
and
illusions
very
easy
persons
who
are
in
great
danger
have
all
kinds
of
hallucinations
particularly
of
people
in
the
court
of
law
when
witnesses
who
have
been
assaulted
testify
to
having
seen
people
hallucination
may
often
be
the
basis
of
their
evidence
hunger
again
or
loss
of
blood
gives
rise
to
the
most
various
hallucinations
menstruation
and
h√¶morrhoids
may
be
the
occasions
of
definite
periodic
visions
and
great
pain
may
be
accompanied
by
hallucinations
which
begin
with
the
pain
become
more
distinct
as
it
increases
and
disappear
when
it
ceases
it
might
seem
that
in
this
matter
also
the
results
are
destructive
and
that
the
statements
of
witnesses
are
untrue
and
unreliable
i
do
not
assert
that
our
valuation
of
these
statements
shall
be
checked
from
all
possible
directions
but
i
do
say
that
much
of
what
we
have
considered
as
true
depends
only
on
illusions
in
the
broad
sense
of
the
word
and
that
it
is
our
duty
before
all
things
rigorously
to
test
everything
that
underlies
our
researches
section
c
imaginative
ideas
illusions
of
sense
hallucinations
and
illusions
proper
taken
as
a
group
differ
from
imaginative
representations
because
the
individual
who
has
them
is
more
or
less
passive
and
subject
to
the
thing
from
which
they
arise
while
with
the
latter
the
individual
is
more
active
and
creates
new
images
by
the
of
existing
or
only
imagined
conditions
it
does
not
matter
whether
these
consist
of
the
idea
only
or
whether
they
are
the
product
of
word
manuscript
picture
sculpture
music
etc
we
have
to
deal
only
with
their
occurrence
and
their
results
of
course
there
is
no
sharp
boundary
between
imaginative
ideas
and
etc
many
phenomena
are
difficult
to
classify
and
even
language
is
uncertain
in
its
usage
the
notion
has
indicated
many
a
false
ideal
many
a
product
of
incoherent
fancy
the
activity
of
the
imagination
taken
in
the
ordinary
sense
requires
analysis
first
of
all
according
to
meinong
there
are
two
kinds
of
imaginative
images
a
generative
and
a
constructive
kind
the
first
exhibits
elements
the
second
unites
them
thus
i
imagine
some
familiar
house
then
i
reproduce
the
idea
of
fire
generative
now
i
unite
these
two
elements
and
imagine
the
house
in
question
in
flames
constructive
this
involves
several
conditions
the
conditions
of
generation
offer
no
difficulties
the
difficulty
lies
in
the
constructive
aspect
of
the
activity
for
we
can
imagine
astonishingly
little
we
can
not
imagine
ourselves
in
the
fourth
dimension
and
although
we
have
always
had
to
make
use
of
such
quantities
we
all
have
the
idea
that
the
quantity
a
represents
a
line
a
square
a
cube
but
as
soon
as
we
have
to
say
what
image
represents
our
mathematical
language
is
at
an
end
even
twelve
men
or
a
green
flame
seen
through
red
glass
or
two
people
speaking
different
things
can
barely
be
imagined
with
any
clearness
we
have
the
elements
but
we
can
not
construct
their
compounds
this
difficulty
occurs
also
in
the
consideration
of
certain
objects
suppose
we
are
looking
at
an
artistically
complete
angel
we
are
always
bothered
by
the
idea
that
his
wings
are
much
too
small
to
enable
him
to
fly
if
an
angel
constructed
like
a
man
is
to
be
borne
by
his
wings
they
must
be
so
gigantic
as
to
be
unreproducible
by
an
artist
indeed
a
person
slightly
more
grubby
and
interested
in
anatomy
will
bother
at
the
sight
of
the
most
beautiful
statue
of
an
angel
concerning
the
construction
of
the
limbs
the
wings
and
their
relation
to
the
skeleton
in
certain
directions
therefore
the
imagination
is
too
weak
to
conceive
an
ethereal
being
in
human
form
floating
in
the
air
further
one
authority
points
out
that
we
think
more
frequently
of
centaurs
than
of
human
beings
with
serpentine
bodies
not
because
centaurs
are
more
√¶sthetic
but
because
horses
are
more
massive
than
serpents
i
do
not
believe
this
to
be
the
true
explanation
for
otherwise
we
should
have
had
to
imagine
people
with
canine
bodies
inasmuch
as
we
see
as
many
dogs
as
horses
if
not
more
but
the
fact
is
correct
and
the
explanation
may
be
that
we
imagine
a
centaur
because
of
the
appropriate
size
the
implied
power
and
because
it
is
not
a
wide
leap
from
a
horseman
to
a
centaur
in
short
here
also
we
see
that
the
imagination
prefers
to
work
where
difficulties
are
fewer
thus
with
the
ease
of
imagining
an
object
there
goes
its
definite
possibility
i
know
an
old
gentleman
in
a
and
another
one
in
b
who
have
never
seen
each
other
but
i
can
easily
imagine
them
together
speaking
playing
cards
and
only
with
difficulty
can
i
think
of
them
as
quarreling
or
betting
in
the
there
is
always
a
certain
ease
and
this
is
appropriated
by
the
imagination
it
is
significant
that
when
others
help
us
and
we
happen
to
find
pleasure
therein
we
answer
to
very
difficult
demands
upon
the
imagination
in
the
opera
the
deviation
from
reality
is
so
powerful
that
it
seems
silly
to
one
unaccustomed
to
it
but
we
do
not
need
the
unaccustomed
person
we
need
only
to
imagine
the
most
ordinary
scene
in
an
opera
a
declaration
of
love
sung
an
aria
declining
it
an
aria
before
committing
suicide
a
singing
choir
with
a
moral
about
this
misfortune
has
anything
even
remotely
like
it
ever
been
seen
in
real
life
but
we
accept
it
quietly
and
find
it
beautiful
and
affecting
simply
because
others
perform
it
without
difficulty
before
our
eyes
and
we
are
willing
to
believe
it
possible
the
rule
to
be
derived
from
all
the
foregoing
is
this
whenever
we
believe
a
statement
to
be
based
on
imagination
or
to
have
been
learned
from
some
imaginative
source
we
must
always
connect
it
with
its
most
proximate
neighbors
and
step
by
step
seek
out
its
elements
and
then
compound
them
in
the
simplest
possible
form
we
may
in
this
fashion
get
perhaps
at
the
proper
content
of
the
matter
of
course
it
need
not
yield
another
imaginary
image
and
its
failure
to
do
so
would
be
an
objection
if
the
compound
were
the
end
of
the
work
and
were
to
be
used
in
itself
but
that
is
not
the
case
all
that
is
required
is
to
derive
a
certain
from
the
of
uncertainties
and
unintelligibility
when
the
construction
is
made
it
must
be
compared
with
all
the
material
at
hand
and
tested
by
that
material
if
the
two
agree
and
only
when
they
agree
may
it
be
assumed
that
the
has
been
properly
chosen
but
not
to
make
this
construction
means
to
feel
around
aimlessly
and
to
give
up
the
job
before
it
has
been
really
begun
let
us
take
the
simplest
possible
instance
of
such
a
situation
in
a
bowling
alley
two
youths
a
and
b
had
a
lively
quarrel
in
which
a
held
the
ball
in
his
hand
and
threatened
to
throw
it
at
head
b
frightened
ran
away
a
pursued
him
after
a
few
steps
threw
the
ball
into
the
grass
caught
b
and
then
gave
him
an
easy
blow
with
the
flat
of
his
hand
on
the
back
of
his
head
b
began
to
wabble
sank
to
the
ground
became
unconscious
and
showed
all
the
signs
of
a
broken
head
unconsciousness
vomiting
distention
of
the
pupils
all
the
particular
details
of
the
event
are
unanimously
testified
to
by
many
witnesses
friends
of
a
and
b
and
among
them
the
parish
priest
simulation
is
completely
excluded
inasmuch
as
b
a
simple
peasant
lad
certainly
did
not
know
the
symptoms
of
and
could
not
hope
for
any
damages
from
the
absolutely
poor
a
let
us
now
consider
what
the
nearest
facts
are
the
elements
of
the
case
are
b
sees
a
heavy
ball
in
hand
a
threatens
b
with
it
and
pursues
him
b
feels
a
blow
on
the
head
the
compounding
of
these
elements
results
in
the
invincible
assumption
on
part
that
a
had
struck
him
on
the
head
with
the
ball
the
consequence
of
this
imaginative
feeling
was
the
development
of
all
the
phenomena
that
would
naturally
have
followed
if
b
had
actually
been
struck
on
the
head
it
would
be
wrong
to
say
that
these
cases
are
so
rare
as
to
be
useless
in
practice
we
simply
do
not
observe
them
for
the
reason
that
we
take
much
to
be
real
because
it
is
confirmed
reliably
more
accurate
examination
would
show
that
many
things
are
merely
imaginative
a
large
portion
of
the
contradictions
we
meet
in
our
cases
is
explicable
by
the
fact
that
one
man
is
the
victim
of
his
fancies
and
the
other
is
not
the
great
number
of
such
fancies
is
evinced
by
the
circumstance
that
there
can
nowhere
be
found
a
chasm
or
boundary
between
the
simplest
fancies
of
the
normal
individual
and
the
impossible
imaginings
of
the
lunatic
every
man
imagines
frequently
the
appearance
of
an
absent
friend
of
a
landscape
he
has
once
seen
the
painter
draws
even
the
features
of
an
absent
model
the
practised
plays
games
without
having
the
board
before
him
persons
half
asleep
see
the
arrival
of
absentees
persons
lost
in
the
wood
at
night
see
spirits
and
ghosts
very
nervous
people
see
them
at
home
and
the
lunatic
sees
the
most
extraordinary
and
disgusting
things
all
these
are
imaginations
beginning
with
the
events
of
the
daily
life
ending
with
the
visions
of
diseased
humanity
where
is
the
boundary
where
a
lacuna
here
as
in
all
events
of
the
daily
life
the
natural
development
of
the
extremely
abnormal
from
the
ordinary
is
the
incontrovertible
evidence
for
the
frequency
of
these
events
of
course
one
must
not
judge
by
self
whoever
does
not
believe
in
the
devil
and
never
as
a
child
had
an
idea
of
him
in
mind
will
never
see
him
as
an
illusion
and
whoever
from
the
beginning
possesses
a
restricted
inaccessible
imagination
can
never
understand
the
other
fellow
who
is
accompanied
by
the
creatures
of
his
imagination
we
observe
this
hundreds
of
times
we
know
that
everybody
sees
a
different
thing
in
clouds
smoke
mountain
tops
ink
blots
coffee
stains
etc
that
everybody
sees
it
according
to
the
character
and
intensity
of
his
imagination
and
that
whatever
seems
to
be
confused
and
unintelligible
is
to
be
explained
as
determined
by
the
nature
of
the
person
who
expresses
or
possesses
it
so
in
the
study
of
any
work
of
art
each
is
the
portrayal
of
some
generality
in
concrete
form
the
concrete
is
understood
by
anybody
who
knows
enough
to
recognize
it
the
generality
can
be
discovered
only
by
him
who
has
a
similar
imagination
and
hence
each
one
draws
a
different
generalization
from
the
same
work
of
art
this
variety
holds
also
in
scientific
questions
i
remember
how
three
scholars
were
trying
to
decipher
hieroglyphs
when
that
branch
of
arch√¶ology
was
still
very
young
one
read
the
inscription
as
a
declaration
of
war
by
a
nomadic
tribe
another
as
the
acquisition
of
a
royal
bride
from
a
foreign
king
and
the
third
as
an
account
of
the
onions
consumed
by
jews
contributing
forced
labor
views
could
hardly
of
themselves
have
made
such
extraordinary
differences
only
imagination
could
have
driven
scholars
in
such
diverse
directions
and
how
little
we
can
apprehend
the
imaginations
of
others
or
judge
them
this
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
we
can
no
longer
tell
whether
children
who
vivify
everything
in
their
imagination
see
their
fancies
as
really
alive
it
is
indubitable
that
the
savage
who
takes
his
fetish
to
be
alive
the
child
that
endows
its
doll
with
life
would
wonder
if
fetish
and
doll
of
themselves
showed
signs
of
vitality
but
whether
they
really
take
them
to
be
alive
is
unknown
to
the
adult
and
if
we
can
not
sympathetically
apprehend
the
views
and
imaginings
of
our
own
youth
how
much
less
possible
is
it
so
to
apprehend
those
of
other
people
we
have
to
add
to
this
fact
moreover
the
characteristic
circumstance
that
less
powerful
effects
must
be
taken
into
consideration
the
power
of
imagination
is
much
more
stimulated
by
mild
peaceful
impressions
than
by
vigorous
ones
the
latter
stun
and
disquiet
the
soul
while
the
former
lead
it
to
the
play
of
ideas
is
much
more
excited
by
mild
tobacco
smoke
than
by
the
fiery
column
of
smoking
vesuvius
the
murmur
of
the
brook
is
much
more
stimulating
than
the
roar
of
the
stormy
sea
if
the
converse
were
true
it
would
be
far
easier
to
observe
the
effects
in
others
we
see
that
a
great
impression
is
at
work
our
attention
is
called
to
its
presence
and
we
are
then
easily
in
the
position
of
observing
its
effect
in
others
but
the
small
insignificant
phenomena
we
observe
the
less
the
less
obvious
their
influence
upon
the
imagination
of
others
appears
to
be
such
small
impressions
pass
hundreds
of
times
without
effect
for
once
however
they
find
a
congenial
soul
their
proper
soil
and
they
begin
to
ferment
but
how
and
when
are
we
to
observe
this
in
others
we
rarely
can
tell
whether
a
imagination
is
at
work
or
not
nevertheless
there
are
innumerable
stories
of
what
famous
men
did
when
their
imagination
was
at
work
napoleon
had
to
cut
things
to
pieces
lenau
used
to
scrape
holes
in
the
ground
mozart
used
to
knot
and
tear
and
napkins
others
used
to
run
around
still
others
used
to
smoke
drink
whistle
etc
but
not
all
people
have
these
characteristics
and
then
we
who
are
to
judge
the
influence
of
the
imagination
on
a
witness
or
a
criminal
are
certainly
not
present
when
the
imagination
is
at
work
to
get
some
notion
of
the
matter
through
witnesses
is
altogether
too
unsafe
a
task
bain
once
justly
proposed
keeping
the
extremities
quiet
as
a
means
of
conquering
anger
thus
it
may
be
definitely
discovered
whether
a
man
was
quite
angry
at
a
given
instant
by
finding
out
whether
his
hands
and
feet
were
quiet
at
the
time
but
such
indices
are
not
given
for
the
activity
of
imagination
moreover
most
people
in
whom
the
imagination
is
quite
vigorously
at
work
know
nothing
about
it
du
says
somewhere
had
a
few
good
ideas
in
my
life
and
have
observed
myself
when
i
had
them
they
came
altogether
involuntarily
without
my
ever
having
thought
of
this
i
do
not
believe
his
imagination
which
was
so
creative
worked
so
easily
and
without
effort
that
he
was
not
aware
of
its
activity
and
moreover
his
fundamental
ideas
were
so
clear
that
everything
fell
into
lines
spontaneously
without
his
being
conscious
of
it
later
this
of
the
imagination
is
so
effortless
to
fortunate
natures
that
it
becomes
an
ordinary
movement
thus
goethe
tells
of
an
imaginary
flower
which
broke
into
its
elements
united
again
broke
again
and
united
in
another
form
etc
his
story
reveals
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
false
descriptions
of
perception
the
perception
is
correct
when
made
then
the
imagination
causes
movements
of
ideas
and
the
question
follows
which
of
the
two
was
more
vigorous
the
perceptive
or
the
imaginal
activity
if
the
one
was
intenser
memory
was
correct
if
the
other
the
recollection
was
erroneous
it
is
hence
important
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
lawyer
to
study
the
nature
and
intensity
of
imagination
we
need
only
to
observe
the
influence
of
imaginal
movements
on
powerful
minds
in
order
to
see
clearly
what
influence
even
their
weak
reflection
may
have
on
ordinary
people
schopenhauer
finds
the
chief
pleasure
of
every
work
of
art
in
imagination
and
goethe
finds
that
no
man
experiences
or
enjoys
anything
without
becoming
productive
most
instructive
is
the
compilation
of
imaginative
ideas
given
by
h√∂fler
and
put
together
from
the
experiences
of
scholars
investigators
artists
and
other
important
persons
for
our
purposes
it
would
be
better
to
have
a
number
of
reliable
statements
from
other
people
which
would
show
how
normal
individuals
were
led
astray
by
their
imaginations
we
might
then
learn
approximately
what
imaginative
notions
might
do
and
how
far
their
limits
extend
sully
calls
attention
to
the
fact
that
characters
were
real
to
him
and
that
when
the
novel
was
completed
its
dramatis
person√¶
became
personal
memories
perhaps
all
imaginative
people
are
likely
to
take
their
imaginings
as
actual
remembered
events
and
persons
if
this
happens
to
a
witness
what
trouble
he
may
cause
us
a
physician
hadekamp
said
that
he
used
to
see
the
flow
of
blood
before
he
cut
the
vein
open
another
physician
schmeisser
confirms
this
experience
such
cases
are
controlled
physically
the
flow
of
blood
can
not
be
seen
before
the
knife
is
removed
yet
how
often
at
least
chronologically
do
similar
mistakes
occur
when
no
such
control
is
present
there
is
the
story
of
a
woman
who
could
describe
so
accurately
symptoms
which
resulted
from
a
swallowed
needle
that
the
physicians
were
deceived
and
undertook
operations
which
only
served
to
show
that
the
woman
had
merely
imagined
it
all
a
similar
case
is
that
of
a
man
who
believed
himself
to
have
swallowed
his
false
teeth
he
even
had
serious
feelings
of
choking
which
immediately
disappeared
on
the
discovery
of
the
teeth
under
his
a
prominent
oculist
told
me
that
he
had
once
treated
for
some
time
a
famous
scholar
because
the
latter
so
accurately
described
a
weakening
of
the
retina
that
the
physician
in
spite
of
his
objective
discoveries
was
deceived
and
learned
his
mistake
only
when
it
appeared
that
the
great
scholar
fortunately
had
been
made
game
of
by
his
own
imagination
maudsley
tells
how
baron
von
swieten
once
saw
burst
a
rotten
corpse
of
a
dog
and
for
years
after
saw
the
same
thing
whenever
he
came
to
the
same
place
many
people
goethe
newton
shelley
william
black
and
others
were
able
completely
to
visualize
past
images
fechner
tells
of
a
man
who
claimed
voluntarily
to
excite
anywhere
on
his
skin
the
feeling
of
pressure
heat
and
cold
but
not
of
cut
prick
or
bruise
because
such
imaginations
tended
to
endure
a
long
time
there
is
the
story
of
another
man
who
had
a
three
pain
in
his
finger
because
he
had
seen
his
child
crush
an
analogous
finger
abercrombie
tells
of
an
otherwise
very
excitable
person
who
believed
in
the
reality
of
the
luck
that
a
had
predicted
for
him
and
some
authorities
hold
that
practically
everybody
who
eagerly
awaits
a
friend
hears
his
step
in
every
sound
observation
that
pruritus
vulv√¶
excites
in
imaginative
women
the
illusion
of
being
raped
is
of
considerable
importance
and
we
criminalists
must
watch
for
it
in
certain
cases
lieber
tells
of
a
colored
preacher
who
so
vividly
painted
the
tortures
in
hell
that
he
himself
could
merely
cry
and
grunt
for
minutes
at
a
time
m√ºller
cites
a
lady
who
was
permitted
to
smell
from
an
empty
bottle
and
who
regularly
lost
consciousness
when
she
was
told
that
the
bottle
contained
laughing
gas
women
often
assert
that
when
about
to
change
their
homes
they
often
see
the
new
residence
in
dreams
just
as
it
really
appears
later
on
then
there
is
a
story
of
a
man
blind
for
fourteen
years
who
nevertheless
saw
the
faces
of
acquaintances
and
was
so
troubled
thereby
that
the
famous
graefe
severed
his
optic
nerve
and
so
released
him
from
his
imagination
taine
describes
the
splendid
scene
in
which
balzac
once
told
mad
de
girardin
that
he
intended
to
give
sandeau
a
horse
he
did
not
do
so
but
talked
so
much
about
it
that
he
used
to
ask
sandeau
how
the
horse
was
taine
comments
that
it
is
clear
that
the
starting
point
of
such
an
illusion
is
a
voluntary
fiction
the
person
in
question
knows
it
as
such
in
the
beginning
but
forgets
it
at
the
end
such
false
memories
are
numerous
among
barbarous
peoples
and
among
raw
untrained
and
childish
minds
they
see
a
simple
fact
the
more
they
think
of
it
the
more
they
see
in
it
they
magnify
and
decorate
it
with
environing
circumstances
and
finally
unite
all
the
details
into
a
whole
in
memory
then
they
are
unable
to
distinguish
what
is
true
from
what
is
not
most
legends
develop
in
this
way
a
peasant
assured
taine
that
he
saw
his
soul
on
the
day
she
died
though
it
was
really
the
light
of
a
brandy
bottle
in
the
sunset
in
conclusion
i
want
to
cite
a
case
i
have
already
mentioned
which
seems
to
me
significant
as
student
i
visited
during
vacation
a
village
one
of
whose
young
peasant
inhabitants
had
gone
to
town
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
my
vacation
from
earliest
childhood
and
known
to
me
as
absolutely
devoted
to
the
truth
when
he
returned
from
his
visit
he
told
me
of
the
wonders
of
the
city
the
climax
of
which
was
the
menagerie
he
had
visited
he
described
what
he
saw
very
well
but
also
said
that
he
had
seen
a
battle
between
an
anaconda
and
a
lion
the
serpent
swallowed
the
lion
and
then
many
moors
came
and
killed
the
serpent
as
was
immediately
to
be
inferred
and
as
i
verified
on
my
return
this
battle
was
to
be
seen
only
on
the
advertising
posters
which
are
hung
in
front
of
every
menagerie
the
imagination
had
been
so
excited
by
what
he
had
seen
that
day
that
the
real
and
the
imagined
were
thoroughly
interfused
how
often
may
this
happen
to
our
witnesses
if
the
notion
of
imagination
is
to
be
limited
to
the
activity
of
representation
we
must
class
under
it
the
premonitions
and
forewarnings
which
are
of
influence
not
only
among
the
uneducated
inasmuch
as
reliable
observations
not
put
together
a
posteriori
are
lacking
nothing
exact
can
be
said
about
them
that
innumerable
assertions
and
a
literature
about
the
matter
exists
is
generally
familiar
and
it
is
undeniable
that
predictions
premonitions
may
be
very
vivid
and
have
considerable
somatic
influence
thus
prophecy
of
approaching
death
certain
threats
or
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
an
death
is
being
prayed
for
may
have
deadly
effect
on
excited
people
the
latter
superstition
especially
has
considerable
influence
praying
for
death
is
aboriginal
it
has
been
traced
historically
into
the
twelfth
century
and
is
made
use
of
today
twelve
years
ago
i
was
told
of
a
case
in
which
an
old
lady
was
killed
because
an
enemy
of
hers
had
the
read
for
her
the
old
lady
simply
died
of
fright
in
some
degree
we
must
pay
attention
to
even
such
apparently
remote
questions
d
section
verbal
misunderstandings
here
too
it
is
not
possible
to
draw
an
absolutely
definite
boundary
between
acoustic
illusions
and
misunderstandings
verbally
we
may
say
that
the
former
occur
when
the
mistake
at
least
in
its
main
characteristic
is
due
to
the
aural
mechanism
the
latter
is
intended
when
there
is
a
mistake
in
the
comprehension
of
a
word
or
of
a
sentence
in
this
case
the
ear
has
acted
efficiently
but
the
mind
did
not
know
how
to
handle
what
had
been
heard
and
so
supplements
it
by
something
else
in
connection
with
matter
more
or
less
senseless
hence
misunderstandings
are
so
frequent
with
foreign
words
compare
the
singing
of
immigrant
school
children
three
teas
of
for
country
of
thee
or
de
lieu
rhone
que
with
your
own
the
question
of
misunderstandings
their
development
and
solution
is
of
great
importance
legally
since
not
only
witnesses
but
clerks
and
secretaries
are
subject
to
them
if
they
are
undiscovered
they
lead
to
dangerous
mistakes
and
their
discovery
causes
great
trouble
in
getting
at
the
correct
solution
the
determination
of
texts
requires
not
only
effort
but
also
psychological
knowledge
and
the
capacity
of
putting
self
in
the
place
of
him
who
has
committed
the
error
to
question
him
may
often
be
impossible
because
of
the
distance
and
may
be
useless
because
he
no
longer
knows
what
he
said
or
wanted
to
say
when
we
consider
what
a
tremendous
amount
of
work
classical
philologists
have
to
put
into
the
determination
of
the
proper
form
of
some
misspelled
word
we
can
guess
how
needful
it
is
to
have
the
textual
form
of
a
protocol
absolutely
correct
the
innocence
or
guilt
of
a
human
being
may
depend
upon
a
misspelled
syllable
now
to
determine
the
proper
and
correct
character
of
the
text
is
as
a
rule
difficult
and
in
most
cases
impossible
whether
a
witness
or
the
secretary
has
misunderstood
makes
no
difference
in
the
nature
of
the
work
its
importance
remains
unaffected
but
in
the
latter
case
the
examining
justice
in
so
far
as
he
correctly
remembers
what
he
has
heard
may
avoid
error
the
mistakes
of
the
secretaries
may
in
any
event
be
reduced
to
a
minimum
if
all
protocols
are
read
immediately
and
not
by
the
secretary
but
by
the
examining
judge
himself
if
the
writer
reads
them
he
makes
the
same
mistakes
and
only
a
very
intelligent
witness
will
perceive
them
and
call
attention
to
them
unless
it
so
happens
the
mistake
remains
i
cite
a
few
of
the
errors
that
i
have
observed
from
a
protocol
with
the
suspect
the
twelfth
of
the
month
i
left
marie
instead
of
instead
of
very
often
words
are
written
in
which
the
dictator
only
says
by
the
way
in
on
up
out
etc
if
such
words
get
into
the
text
at
all
it
is
difficult
to
puzzle
out
how
they
got
in
how
easily
and
frequently
people
misunderstand
is
shown
by
the
oath
they
take
hardly
a
day
passes
on
which
at
least
one
witness
does
not
say
some
absolute
nonsense
while
repeating
it
the
discovery
of
such
errors
and
the
substitution
of
what
is
correct
brings
us
back
to
the
old
rule
that
the
mere
study
of
our
own
cases
can
not
teach
us
anything
since
the
field
of
view
is
too
narrow
the
material
too
uniform
and
the
stimulation
too
light
other
disciplines
must
be
studied
and
examples
from
the
daily
life
must
be
sought
goethe
in
particular
can
teach
us
here
in
his
little
monograph
druckfehler
he
first
tells
that
he
had
discovered
the
most
curious
mistakes
in
hearing
when
he
reread
dictated
letters
mistakes
which
would
have
caused
great
difficulty
if
not
immediately
looked
after
the
only
means
for
the
solution
of
these
errors
is
he
says
read
the
matter
aloud
get
thoroughly
into
its
meaning
and
repeat
the
unintelligible
word
so
long
that
the
right
one
occurs
in
the
flow
of
speech
nobody
hears
all
that
he
knows
nobody
is
conscious
of
all
that
he
senses
is
able
to
imagine
or
to
think
persons
who
have
never
been
to
school
tend
to
turn
into
german
all
latin
and
greek
expressions
the
same
thing
happens
just
as
much
with
words
from
foreign
languages
whose
pronunciation
is
unknown
to
the
writer
and
in
dictation
it
occurs
that
a
hearer
sets
his
inner
inclination
passion
and
need
in
the
place
of
the
word
he
has
heard
and
substitutes
for
it
the
name
of
some
loved
person
or
some
much
desired
good
a
better
device
for
the
detection
of
errors
than
that
suggested
by
goethe
can
not
be
found
but
the
protocol
or
whatever
else
it
may
be
must
be
otherwise
nothing
helps
many
mistakes
are
due
as
m√ºnsterberg
points
out
to
the
fact
that
the
word
is
seen
for
just
an
instant
and
it
is
easy
to
misread
a
word
so
seen
if
some
similar
word
had
been
heard
or
seen
just
before
the
most
senseless
corruptions
of
text
occur
often
and
it
seems
extraordinary
how
they
may
be
overlooked
andresen
points
out
that
the
reason
for
all
popular
explanations
is
the
consciousness
of
language
which
struggles
against
allowing
any
name
to
be
an
empty
sound
and
still
more
strives
to
give
each
term
a
separate
meaning
and
an
indubitable
intelligibility
the
human
mind
acts
here
instinctively
and
na√Øvely
without
any
reflection
and
is
determined
by
feeling
or
accident
then
it
makes
all
kinds
of
transformations
of
foreign
words
this
fits
with
the
analogous
observation
that
a
group
of
catholic
patron
saints
depend
for
their
character
on
their
names
santa
clara
makes
clear
vision
lucy
sounds
like
lucida
and
is
the
saint
of
the
blind
mamertus
is
analogous
to
mamma
the
feminine
breast
and
is
the
patron
saint
of
nurses
and
nursing
women
instructive
substitutions
are
jack
spear
for
shakespeare
apolda
for
apollo
great
victory
at
le
mans
for
great
victory
at
lehmanns
depot
for
de
andresen
warns
us
against
going
too
far
in
analysis
exaggerations
are
easy
particularly
when
we
want
to
get
at
the
source
of
a
misunderstanding
because
of
the
illegibility
of
the
style
our
task
consists
first
of
all
in
getting
at
the
correctness
of
what
has
been
said
or
written
otherwise
we
have
nothing
whatever
to
go
by
only
when
that
is
quite
impossible
may
we
assume
misunderstandings
and
seek
them
out
the
procedure
then
must
be
necessarily
linguistic
and
psychological
and
requires
the
consultation
of
experts
in
both
fields
certain
instructive
misunderstandings
of
the
most
obvious
sort
occur
when
the
drop
their
dialect
or
thoroughly
educated
people
alter
the
dialectical
expressions
and
try
to
translate
them
into
high
german
it
is
frequently
important
to
understand
the
curious
transposition
in
meaning
which
foreign
words
get
commode
fidel
and
famos
a
commode
gentleman
means
in
german
a
pliable
person
and
a
fidel
lad
is
not
a
loyal
soul
but
a
merry
one
famos
originally
means
expensive
or
pleasant
it
may
be
not
unimportant
to
understand
how
names
are
altered
thus
i
know
a
man
who
curiously
enough
was
called
kammerdiener
whose
father
was
an
immigrant
italian
called
comadina
and
i
know
two
old
men
brothers
who
lived
in
different
parts
of
the
country
one
of
whom
was
called
joseph
waldhauser
the
other
leopold
balthasar
in
the
course
of
the
generation
the
name
had
so
completely
changed
that
it
is
impossible
to
say
which
is
correct
again
a
family
bearing
the
name
theobald
is
of
french
origin
and
used
really
to
be
called
du
val
in
steiermark
which
had
been
with
turks
two
hundred
years
ago
there
are
many
family
names
of
turkish
origin
thus
hasen√∂hrl
may
come
from
hassan
√∂ri
salata
from
saladin
mullenbock
from
mullei
beg
sullman
from
soliman
section
the
quantitative
method
of
modern
psychophysics
may
lead
to
an
exact
experimental
determination
of
such
false
conceptions
and
misunderstandings
as
those
indicated
above
but
it
is
still
too
young
to
have
any
practical
value
it
is
vitiated
by
the
fact
that
it
requires
artificial
conditions
and
that
the
results
have
reference
to
artificial
conditions
wundt
has
tried
to
simplify
apparatus
and
to
bring
experiment
into
connection
with
real
life
but
there
is
still
a
far
cry
from
the
psychological
laboratory
to
the
business
of
life
with
regard
to
misunderstandings
the
case
is
certainly
so
most
occur
when
we
do
not
hear
distinctly
what
another
person
is
saying
and
supplement
it
with
our
own
notions
here
the
misunderstanding
is
in
no
sense
linguistic
for
words
do
not
receive
a
false
meaning
the
misunderstanding
lies
in
the
failure
to
comprehend
the
sense
of
what
we
have
heard
and
the
substitution
of
incorrect
interpretations
sometimes
we
may
quite
understand
an
orator
without
having
heard
every
word
by
simply
adding
these
interpretations
but
the
correctness
of
the
additions
is
always
questionable
and
not
only
nature
and
training
but
momentary
conditions
and
personal
attitude
make
a
considerable
difference
the
worst
thing
about
the
matter
is
the
fact
that
nobody
is
likely
to
be
aware
that
he
has
made
any
interpretations
yet
we
do
so
not
only
in
listening
but
in
looking
i
see
on
a
roof
in
the
distance
four
white
balls
about
the
nature
of
which
i
am
uncertain
while
looking
i
observe
that
one
of
the
balls
stretches
out
head
and
tail
flaps
its
wings
and
i
immediately
think
those
are
four
now
it
may
be
true
that
they
are
four
pigeons
but
what
justification
had
i
for
such
an
interpretation
and
generalization
from
the
action
of
one
pigeon
in
this
instance
no
doubt
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
me
to
make
a
mistake
but
there
are
many
cases
which
are
not
so
obvious
and
where
the
interpretation
is
nevertheless
made
and
then
the
misunderstanding
is
ready
to
hand
once
my
wife
and
i
saw
from
our
seats
in
the
car
a
who
stood
in
a
railroad
station
as
he
bent
over
looking
for
a
lost
coin
my
very
myopic
wife
cried
out
at
the
beautiful
newfoundland
now
this
is
a
conceivable
illusion
for
a
individual
but
on
what
basis
could
my
good
lady
interpret
what
she
saw
into
the
judgment
that
it
was
a
newfoundland
dog
and
a
beautiful
one
at
that
taine
illustrates
a
similar
process
with
the
story
of
a
child
who
asked
why
his
mother
had
put
on
a
white
dress
he
was
told
that
his
mother
was
going
to
a
party
and
had
to
put
on
her
holiday
clothes
for
that
purpose
after
that
whenever
the
child
saw
anybody
in
holiday
attire
green
or
red
or
any
other
color
it
cried
out
you
have
a
white
dress
on
we
adults
do
exactly
the
same
thing
as
meinong
says
so
well
we
confuse
identity
with
agreement
this
proposition
would
save
us
from
a
great
many
mistakes
and
misunderstandings
if
kept
in
mind
how
frequently
and
hastily
we
build
things
out
is
shown
by
a
simple
but
psychologically
important
game
ask
anybody
at
hand
how
the
four
and
the
six
look
on
his
watch
and
let
him
draw
it
everybody
calmly
draws
iv
and
vi
but
if
you
look
at
your
watch
you
will
find
that
the
four
looks
so
iiii
and
that
there
is
no
six
this
raises
the
involuntary
question
what
do
we
see
when
we
look
at
the
watch
if
we
do
not
see
the
figures
and
the
further
question
we
make
such
beautiful
mistakes
with
all
things
i
assert
that
only
that
has
been
reliably
seen
which
has
been
drawn
my
father
asked
my
drawing
teacher
to
teach
me
not
to
draw
but
to
observe
and
my
teacher
instead
of
giving
me
copies
followed
the
instruction
by
giving
me
first
one
domino
then
two
then
three
one
upon
the
other
then
a
match
box
a
book
a
candlestick
etc
and
even
today
i
know
accurately
only
those
objects
in
the
household
which
i
had
drawn
yet
frequently
we
demand
of
our
witnesses
minutely
accurate
descriptions
of
things
they
had
seen
only
once
and
hastily
at
that
and
even
if
the
thing
has
been
seen
frequently
local
and
temporal
problems
may
make
great
difficulties
with
regard
to
the
first
class
of
problems
exner
cites
the
example
of
his
journey
from
gmunden
to
vienna
in
which
because
of
a
sharp
curve
in
the
road
he
saw
everything
at
lambach
reversed
although
the
whole
stretch
of
road
was
familiar
to
him
the
railroad
trains
the
public
buildings
the
rivers
all
the
notable
places
seemed
to
lie
on
the
wrong
side
this
is
particularly
characteristic
if
a
city
is
entered
especially
at
night
through
a
railroad
terminal
and
the
locomotive
is
attached
to
the
rear
of
the
train
in
the
daily
life
the
alteration
of
objects
by
locations
is
familiar
how
different
a
landscape
seems
at
night
or
in
winter
although
it
has
been
observed
hundreds
of
times
during
the
day
or
in
summer
it
is
good
to
look
around
frequently
on
the
road
particularly
at
if
the
way
back
is
to
be
kept
in
mind
even
the
starting
point
may
have
a
disturbing
effect
on
the
sense
of
place
for
example
if
you
have
traveled
numerous
times
on
the
train
from
a
to
b
and
for
once
you
start
your
journey
from
c
which
is
beyond
a
the
familiar
stretch
from
a
to
b
looks
quite
different
and
may
even
become
unrecognizable
the
estimation
of
time
may
exercise
considerable
influence
on
such
and
similar
local
effects
under
most
circumstances
we
tend
as
is
known
to
reduce
subjectively
great
and
hence
when
more
time
than
customary
is
required
by
an
event
this
becomes
subjectively
smaller
not
only
for
the
whole
event
but
also
for
each
of
its
parts
in
this
way
what
formerly
seemed
to
extend
through
an
apparently
long
period
seems
now
to
be
compressed
into
a
shorter
one
then
everything
appears
too
soon
and
adds
to
the
foreign
aspect
of
the
matter
the
case
is
similar
for
uphues
cites
an
example
a
person
has
not
heard
a
bell
or
anything
else
for
some
time
and
then
hears
it
again
the
question
whether
the
object
existed
in
the
interval
does
not
arise
it
is
recognized
again
and
that
is
certainly
it
is
enough
for
but
whether
the
thing
is
true
whether
really
the
same
phenomena
or
only
similar
ones
have
been
noted
is
another
question
rarely
asked
if
the
man
or
the
bell
is
the
same
that
we
now
perceive
anew
the
inference
is
involuntarily
drawn
that
they
must
have
persisted
but
we
eliminate
altogether
the
lapse
of
time
and
suppose
unconsciously
that
the
entity
in
question
must
have
been
on
the
spot
through
the
whole
period
one
needs
only
to
observe
how
quickly
witnesses
tend
to
identify
objects
presented
for
identification
knives
letters
purses
etc
to
receive
for
identification
and
to
say
yes
is
often
the
work
of
an
instant
the
witness
argues
quite
unconsciously
in
this
fashion
have
given
the
judge
only
one
clew
perhaps
different
from
the
one
in
question
now
here
again
is
a
clew
hence
it
must
be
the
one
i
gave
that
the
matter
may
have
changed
that
there
has
been
some
confusion
that
perhaps
other
witnesses
have
given
similar
things
is
not
at
all
considered
here
again
we
have
to
beware
of
confusing
of
identities
with
agreements
finally
we
must
consider
fatigue
and
other
conditions
of
excitation
everybody
knows
how
things
read
late
at
night
seem
absolute
nonsense
and
become
simple
and
obvious
the
next
morning
in
the
same
way
we
may
take
a
thing
to
be
thus
and
so
while
tired
in
the
evening
and
in
the
morning
see
our
notion
to
be
a
coarse
misunderstanding
hoppe
tells
of
a
hospital
interne
who
became
so
excited
and
tired
through
frequent
calls
that
he
heard
the
of
his
watch
as
a
witness
who
has
been
subjected
to
a
prolonged
and
fatiguing
examination
falls
into
a
similar
condition
and
knows
at
the
end
much
less
than
at
the
beginning
finally
he
altogether
misunderstands
the
questions
put
to
him
the
situation
becomes
still
worse
when
the
defendant
has
been
so
subjected
to
examination
and
becomes
involved
because
of
fatigue
in
the
famous
if
occur
at
the
end
of
a
long
examination
of
a
witness
or
a
defendant
it
is
well
to
find
out
how
long
the
examination
took
if
it
took
much
time
the
contradictions
mean
little
the
same
phenomena
of
fatigue
may
even
lead
to
suspicion
of
negligence
doctors
trained
nurses
nursery
maids
young
mothers
who
became
guilty
of
of
invalids
and
children
have
in
many
instances
merely
because
of
great
fatigue
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
numerous
sad
cases
occur
in
which
are
punished
for
negligence
if
a
man
of
this
class
year
after
year
serves
hours
then
rests
seven
hours
then
serves
hours
again
he
is
inevitably
overtaken
by
fatigue
and
nervous
relaxation
in
which
signals
warnings
calls
are
simply
misunderstood
statistics
tend
to
show
that
the
largest
number
of
accidents
occur
at
the
end
of
a
period
of
service
at
the
time
of
greatest
fatigue
but
even
if
this
were
not
the
case
some
reference
must
be
made
to
chronic
fatigue
if
a
man
gets
only
seven
rest
after
intense
labor
part
of
the
must
have
remained
they
accumulate
in
time
finally
they
summate
and
exercise
their
influence
even
at
the
beginning
of
the
service
socialists
complain
justly
about
this
matter
the
most
responsible
positions
are
occupied
by
chronically
fatigued
individuals
and
when
nature
extorts
her
rights
we
punish
the
helpless
men
the
case
is
the
same
with
people
who
have
much
to
do
with
money
tax
post
bank
and
treasury
officials
who
are
obliged
to
attend
rigorously
to
monotonous
work
the
reception
and
distribution
of
money
easily
grow
tired
men
of
experience
in
this
profession
have
assured
me
that
they
often
when
fatigued
take
money
count
it
sign
a
receipt
and
then
return
the
money
to
the
person
who
brought
it
fortunately
they
recognize
their
mistake
in
the
astonishment
of
the
receiver
if
however
they
do
not
recognize
it
or
the
receiver
is
sly
enough
calmly
to
walk
off
with
the
money
if
the
sum
is
great
and
restitution
not
easily
possible
and
if
moreover
the
official
happens
to
be
in
the
bad
graces
of
his
superiors
he
does
not
have
much
chance
in
the
prosecution
for
embezzlement
which
is
more
likely
than
not
to
be
begun
against
him
any
affection
any
stimulus
any
fatigue
may
tend
to
make
people
passive
and
hence
less
able
to
defend
themselves
a
well
known
berlin
psychiatrist
tells
the
following
story
i
was
still
an
apprentice
in
an
asylum
i
always
carried
the
keys
of
the
cells
with
me
one
day
i
went
to
the
opera
and
had
a
seat
in
the
parquette
between
the
acts
i
went
into
the
corridor
on
returning
i
made
a
mistake
and
saw
before
me
a
door
which
had
the
same
kind
of
lock
as
the
in
the
asylum
stuck
my
hand
into
my
pocket
took
out
my
key
which
fitted
and
found
myself
suddenly
in
a
loge
now
would
it
not
be
possible
in
this
way
purely
by
reflex
action
to
turn
into
a
burglar
of
course
we
should
hardly
believe
a
known
burglar
if
he
were
to
tell
us
such
a
story
e
section
general
considerations
in
a
certain
sense
a
large
part
of
the
work
is
nothing
more
than
a
battle
against
lies
he
has
to
discover
the
truth
and
must
fight
the
opposite
he
meets
this
opposite
at
every
step
the
accused
often
one
who
has
confessed
completely
many
of
the
witnesses
try
to
get
advantage
of
him
and
frequently
he
has
to
struggle
with
himself
when
he
perceives
that
he
is
working
in
a
direction
which
he
can
not
completely
justify
utterly
to
vanquish
the
lie
particularly
in
our
work
is
of
course
impossible
and
to
describe
its
nature
exhaustively
is
to
write
a
natural
history
of
mankind
we
must
limit
ourselves
to
the
consideration
of
a
definite
number
of
means
great
and
small
which
will
make
our
work
easier
will
warn
us
of
the
presence
of
deception
and
will
prevent
its
playing
a
part
i
have
attempted
to
compile
forms
of
it
according
to
intent
and
will
here
add
a
few
words
that
by
the
lie
is
meant
the
intentional
deliverance
of
a
conscious
untruth
for
the
purpose
of
deception
is
as
familiar
as
the
variety
of
opinion
concerning
the
permissibility
of
necessary
lies
of
the
pious
of
the
pedagogic
and
the
conventional
we
have
to
assume
here
the
standpoint
of
absolute
rigorism
and
to
say
with
kant
lie
in
its
mere
form
is
crime
against
his
own
nature
and
is
a
vice
which
must
make
a
man
disreputable
in
his
own
we
can
not
actually
think
of
a
single
case
in
which
we
find
any
ground
for
lying
for
we
lawyers
need
have
no
pedagogical
duties
nor
are
we
compelled
to
teach
people
manners
and
a
situation
in
which
we
may
save
ourselves
by
lying
is
unthinkable
of
course
we
will
not
speak
all
we
know
indeed
a
proper
silence
is
a
sign
of
a
good
criminalist
but
we
need
never
lie
the
beginner
must
especially
learn
that
the
to
serve
the
case
and
the
excusing
to
do
duty
by
which
little
lies
are
sometimes
justified
have
absolutely
no
worth
an
incidental
word
as
if
the
accomplice
had
confessed
an
expression
intending
to
convey
that
you
know
more
than
you
do
a
perversion
of
some
earlier
statement
of
the
witness
and
similar
tricks
can
not
be
cheaper
than
the
cheapest
things
their
use
results
only
in
own
shame
and
if
they
fail
the
defense
has
the
advantage
the
lost
ground
can
never
be
regained
nor
is
it
permissible
to
lie
by
gestures
and
actions
any
more
than
by
words
these
indeed
are
dangerous
because
a
movement
of
the
hand
a
reaching
for
the
bell
a
sudden
rising
may
be
very
effective
under
circumstances
they
easily
indicate
that
the
judge
knows
more
about
the
matter
than
he
really
does
or
suggest
that
his
information
is
greater
etc
they
make
the
witness
or
defendant
think
that
the
judge
is
already
certain
about
the
nature
of
the
case
that
he
has
resolved
upon
important
measures
and
other
such
things
now
movements
of
this
kind
are
not
recorded
and
in
case
the
denial
of
blame
is
not
serious
a
young
criminalist
allows
himself
easily
to
be
misled
by
his
desire
for
efficiency
even
accident
may
help
when
i
was
examining
justice
i
had
to
hear
the
testimony
of
a
rather
lad
who
was
suspected
of
having
stolen
and
hidden
a
large
sum
of
money
the
lad
firmly
and
cleverly
denied
his
guilt
during
the
examination
a
comrade
entered
who
had
something
official
to
tell
me
and
inasmuch
as
i
was
in
the
midst
of
dictation
he
wanted
to
wait
until
the
end
of
the
sentence
happening
to
see
two
swords
that
had
just
been
brought
from
a
student
duel
he
took
one
in
his
hand
and
examined
the
hilt
the
point
and
the
blade
the
defendant
hardly
saw
this
action
before
he
got
frightened
raised
his
hands
ran
to
the
crying
confess
i
confess
i
took
the
money
and
hid
it
in
the
hollow
hickory
this
event
was
rather
funny
another
however
led
i
will
not
say
to
but
to
considerable
disquiet
on
my
part
a
man
was
suspected
of
having
killed
his
two
small
children
as
the
bodies
were
not
found
i
undertook
a
careful
search
of
his
home
of
the
oven
of
the
cellar
the
drains
etc
in
the
latter
we
found
a
great
deal
of
animal
entrails
apparently
rabbits
as
at
the
time
of
this
discovery
i
had
no
notion
of
where
they
belonged
i
took
them
and
in
the
meantime
had
them
preserved
in
alcohol
the
great
glass
receptacle
which
contained
them
stood
on
my
writing
table
when
i
had
the
accused
brought
in
to
answer
certain
questions
about
one
or
two
suspicious
matters
we
had
discovered
he
looked
anxiously
at
the
glass
and
said
suddenly
you
have
got
it
all
i
must
almost
reflexly
i
asked
are
the
corpses
and
he
immediately
answered
that
he
had
hidden
them
in
the
environs
of
the
city
where
they
were
found
clearly
the
glass
containing
the
intestines
had
led
him
to
the
notion
that
the
bodies
were
found
and
in
part
preserved
here
and
when
i
asked
him
where
they
were
he
did
not
observe
how
illogical
the
question
would
be
if
the
bodies
had
really
been
found
the
whole
thing
was
a
matter
of
accident
but
i
still
have
the
feeling
that
the
confession
was
not
properly
obtained
that
i
should
have
thought
of
the
effect
of
the
glass
and
should
have
provided
against
it
before
the
accused
was
brought
before
me
in
the
daily
life
such
an
open
procedure
is
of
course
impossible
and
if
the
circumstances
were
to
be
taken
for
what
they
seem
we
should
frequently
make
mistakes
everybody
knows
how
very
few
happy
marriages
there
are
but
how
do
we
know
it
only
because
the
fortune
of
close
observation
always
indicates
that
the
relation
is
in
no
way
so
happy
as
one
would
like
it
to
be
and
externally
has
anybody
ever
seen
in
even
circles
a
street
quarrel
between
husband
and
wife
how
they
are
in
society
and
how
little
they
show
their
disinclination
for
each
other
and
all
this
is
a
lie
in
word
and
deed
and
when
we
have
to
deal
with
it
in
a
criminal
case
we
judge
according
to
the
purely
external
things
that
we
and
others
have
observed
social
reasons
deference
for
public
opinion
which
must
often
be
deceived
the
feeling
of
duty
toward
children
not
infrequently
compel
deception
of
the
world
the
number
of
fortunate
marriages
is
mainly
overestimated
we
see
the
same
thing
with
regard
to
property
the
attitude
of
parents
and
children
the
relation
between
superiors
and
inferiors
even
in
the
condition
of
health
conduct
in
all
these
cases
does
not
reveal
the
true
state
of
affairs
one
after
another
people
are
fooled
until
finally
the
world
believes
what
it
is
told
and
the
court
hears
the
belief
sworn
to
as
absolute
truth
it
is
perhaps
not
too
much
to
say
that
we
are
far
more
deceived
by
appearances
than
by
words
public
opinion
should
least
of
all
impose
on
us
and
yet
it
is
through
public
opinion
that
we
learn
the
external
relations
of
the
people
who
come
before
us
it
is
called
vox
populi
and
is
really
rot
the
phrases
say
knows
doubts
most
neighbors
agree
and
however
else
these
seeds
of
dishonesty
and
slander
may
be
designated
all
these
phrases
must
disappear
from
our
papers
and
procedure
they
indicate
only
appearances
only
what
people
to
have
seen
they
do
not
reveal
the
real
and
the
hidden
law
too
frequently
makes
normative
use
of
the
maxim
that
the
bad
world
says
it
and
the
good
one
believes
it
it
even
constructs
its
judgments
thereby
not
infrequently
the
uttered
lies
must
be
supported
by
actions
it
is
that
we
seem
merry
angry
or
friendly
only
when
we
excite
these
feelings
by
certain
gestures
imitations
and
physical
attitudes
anger
is
not
easily
simulated
with
an
unclenched
fist
immovable
feet
and
uncontracted
brow
these
gestures
are
required
for
the
appearance
of
real
anger
and
how
very
real
it
becomes
and
how
very
real
all
other
emotions
become
because
of
the
appropriate
gestures
and
actions
is
familiar
we
learn
hence
that
the
earnest
assertor
of
his
innocence
finally
begins
to
believe
in
it
a
little
or
altogether
and
lying
witnesses
still
more
frequently
begin
to
hold
their
assertions
to
be
true
as
these
people
do
not
show
the
common
marks
of
the
lie
their
treatment
is
extraordinarily
difficult
it
is
perhaps
right
to
accuse
our
age
of
especial
inclination
for
that
lie
which
makes
its
perpetrator
believe
in
his
own
creation
kiefer
cites
examples
of
such
what
drives
one
to
despair
is
the
fact
that
these
people
are
such
clever
liars
that
they
make
a
game
of
the
business
it
is
a
piece
of
luck
that
these
lies
like
every
lie
betray
themselves
by
the
characteristic
intensity
with
which
they
seek
to
assume
the
appearance
of
truth
this
important
mark
of
the
lie
can
not
be
too
clearly
indicated
the
number
and
vigor
of
lies
must
show
that
we
more
frequently
fail
to
think
of
their
possibility
than
if
they
did
not
exist
at
all
a
long
time
ago
i
read
an
apparently
simple
story
which
has
helped
me
frequently
in
my
criminalistic
work
karl
was
dining
with
his
parents
and
two
cousins
and
after
dinner
said
at
school
were
fourteen
of
us
at
table
is
it
possible
has
lied
how
frequently
does
an
event
seem
inexplicable
mysterious
puzzling
but
if
you
think
that
here
perhaps
has
lied
again
you
may
be
led
to
more
accurate
observation
and
hence
to
the
discovery
of
some
hiatus
by
means
of
which
the
whole
affair
may
be
cleared
up
but
frequently
contradictions
are
still
more
simply
explained
by
the
fact
that
they
are
not
contradictions
and
by
the
fact
that
we
see
them
as
such
through
inadequate
comprehension
of
what
has
been
said
and
ignorance
of
the
conditions
we
often
pay
too
much
attention
to
lies
and
contradictions
there
is
the
prejudice
that
the
accused
is
really
the
criminal
and
that
moves
us
to
give
unjustified
reasons
for
little
accidental
facts
which
lead
afterwards
to
apparent
contradictions
this
habit
is
very
old
if
we
inquire
when
the
lie
has
least
influence
on
mankind
we
find
it
to
be
under
emotional
stress
especially
during
anger
joy
fear
and
on
the
we
all
know
of
various
cases
in
which
a
man
angry
at
the
betrayal
of
an
accomplice
happy
over
approaching
release
or
terrified
by
the
likelihood
of
arrest
suddenly
declares
i
am
going
to
tell
the
and
this
is
a
typical
form
which
introduces
the
subsequent
confession
as
a
rule
the
resolution
to
tell
the
truth
does
not
last
long
if
the
emotion
passes
the
confession
is
regretted
and
much
thought
is
given
to
the
withdrawal
of
a
part
of
the
confession
if
the
protocols
concerning
the
matter
are
very
long
this
regret
is
easily
observable
toward
the
end
that
it
is
not
easy
to
lie
during
intoxication
is
well
known
what
is
said
on
the
may
always
especially
if
the
confessor
is
positively
religious
be
taken
to
be
true
it
is
known
that
under
such
circumstances
the
consciousness
of
even
mentally
disturbed
people
and
idiots
becomes
remarkably
clear
and
very
often
astonishing
illuminations
result
if
the
mind
of
the
dying
be
already
clouded
it
is
never
difficult
to
determine
the
fact
inasmuch
as
particularly
such
confessions
are
distinguished
by
the
great
simplicity
and
clearness
of
the
very
few
words
used
section
pathoformic
as
in
many
other
forms
of
human
expression
there
is
a
stage
in
the
telling
of
lies
where
the
normal
condition
has
passed
and
the
diseased
one
has
not
yet
begun
the
extreme
limit
on
the
one
side
is
the
harmless
the
hunter
the
tourist
the
student
the
lieutenant
all
of
whom
boast
a
little
on
the
other
side
there
is
the
completely
insane
paralytic
who
tells
about
his
millions
and
his
monstrous
achievements
the
characteristic
pseudologia
phantastica
the
lie
of
advanced
hysteria
in
which
people
write
anonymous
letters
and
send
messages
to
themselves
to
their
servants
to
high
officials
and
to
clergy
in
order
to
cast
suspicion
on
them
are
all
diseased
the
characteristic
lie
of
the
epileptics
and
perhaps
also
the
lies
of
people
who
are
close
to
the
idiocy
of
old
age
mixes
up
what
has
been
experienced
read
and
told
and
represents
it
as
the
experience
of
the
speaker
still
there
is
a
class
of
people
who
can
not
be
shown
to
be
in
any
sense
diseased
and
who
still
lie
in
such
a
fashion
that
they
can
not
be
well
the
development
of
such
lies
may
probably
be
best
assigned
to
progressive
habituation
people
who
commit
these
falsehoods
may
be
people
of
talent
and
as
goethe
says
of
himself
may
have
to
most
of
them
are
people
i
will
not
say
who
are
desirous
of
honor
but
who
are
still
so
endowed
that
they
would
be
glad
to
play
some
grand
part
and
are
eager
to
push
their
own
personality
into
the
foreground
if
they
do
not
succeed
in
the
daily
life
they
try
to
convince
themselves
and
others
by
progressively
broader
stories
that
they
really
hold
a
prominent
position
i
had
and
still
have
opportunity
to
study
accurately
several
types
of
these
people
they
not
only
have
in
common
the
fact
that
they
lie
they
also
have
common
themes
they
tell
how
important
personages
asked
their
advice
sought
their
company
and
honored
them
they
suggest
their
great
influence
are
eager
to
grant
their
patronage
and
protection
suggest
their
great
intimacy
with
persons
of
high
position
exaggerate
when
they
speak
of
their
property
their
achievements
and
their
work
and
broadly
deny
all
events
in
which
they
are
set
at
a
disadvantage
the
thing
by
which
they
are
to
be
distinguished
from
ordinary
and
which
defines
what
is
essentially
pathoformic
in
them
is
the
fact
that
they
lie
without
considering
that
the
untrue
is
discovered
immediately
or
very
soon
thus
they
will
tell
somebody
that
he
has
to
thank
their
patronage
for
this
or
that
although
the
person
in
question
knows
the
case
to
be
absolutely
different
or
again
they
tell
somebody
of
an
achievement
of
theirs
and
the
man
happens
to
have
been
closely
concerned
with
that
particular
work
and
is
able
to
estimate
properly
their
relation
to
it
again
they
promise
things
which
the
auditor
knows
they
can
not
perform
and
they
boast
of
their
wealth
although
at
least
one
auditor
knows
its
amount
accurately
if
their
stories
are
objected
to
they
have
some
extraordinarily
unskilful
explanation
which
again
indicates
the
pathoformic
character
of
their
minds
their
lies
most
resemble
those
of
pregnant
women
or
women
also
that
particular
form
of
lie
which
prostitutes
seem
typically
addicted
to
and
which
are
cited
by
carlier
lombroso
ferrero
as
representative
of
them
and
as
a
professional
mark
of
identification
i
also
suspect
that
the
essentially
pathoformic
lie
has
some
relation
to
sex
perhaps
to
perversity
or
impotence
or
exaggerated
sexual
impulse
and
i
believe
that
it
occurs
more
frequently
than
is
supposed
although
it
is
easily
known
in
even
its
slightly
developed
stages
i
once
believed
that
the
pathoformic
lie
was
not
of
great
importance
in
our
work
because
on
the
one
hand
it
is
most
complete
and
distinct
when
it
deals
with
the
person
of
the
speaker
and
on
the
other
it
is
so
characteristic
that
it
must
be
recognized
without
fail
by
anybody
who
has
had
the
slightest
experience
with
it
but
since
i
have
noticed
that
the
pathoformic
lie
plays
an
enormous
part
in
the
work
of
the
criminalist
and
deserves
full
consideration
topic
iv
isolated
special
conditions
section
a
sleep
and
dream
if
a
phenomenon
occurs
frequently
its
frequency
must
have
a
certain
relation
to
its
importance
to
the
criminalist
hence
sleep
and
dream
must
in
any
event
be
of
great
influence
upon
our
task
as
we
rarely
hear
them
mentioned
we
have
underestimated
their
significance
the
literature
dealing
with
them
is
comparatively
rich
the
physician
is
to
be
called
in
not
only
when
we
are
dealing
with
conditions
of
sleep
and
dream
which
are
in
the
least
diseased
abnormally
intense
sleepiness
hallucinatory
dreams
but
also
when
the
physiological
side
of
sleep
and
dream
are
in
question
the
need
of
sleep
the
effect
of
insomnia
of
normal
sleepiness
etc
the
criminalist
must
study
also
these
things
in
order
to
know
the
kind
of
situation
he
is
facing
and
when
he
is
to
call
in
the
physician
for
assistance
ignorance
of
the
matter
means
spoiling
a
case
by
unskilful
interrogation
and
neglect
of
the
most
important
things
at
the
very
least
it
makes
the
work
essentially
more
difficult
but
in
many
cases
the
criminalist
must
act
alone
since
in
those
cases
there
is
neither
disease
nor
a
physiological
condition
by
way
of
explanation
but
merely
a
simple
fact
of
the
daily
life
which
any
educated
layman
must
deal
with
for
himself
suppose
we
are
studying
the
influence
of
a
dream
upon
our
emotions
it
has
been
shown
that
frequently
one
may
spend
a
whole
day
under
the
influence
of
a
dream
that
attitude
is
happy
and
merry
as
if
something
pleasant
had
been
learned
or
one
is
cross
afraid
excited
as
if
something
unhappy
had
happened
the
reason
and
source
of
these
attitudes
is
frequently
a
pleasant
or
unpleasant
dream
and
sometimes
this
may
be
at
work
subconsciously
and
unremembered
we
have
already
shown
that
errors
of
memory
are
to
a
large
extent
attributable
to
dreams
this
effect
of
the
dream
may
be
of
significance
in
women
excitable
men
and
especially
in
children
there
are
children
who
consider
their
dreams
as
real
experiences
and
women
who
are
unable
to
distinguish
between
dreams
and
real
experience
while
the
senile
and
aged
can
not
distinguish
dreams
and
memories
because
their
memories
and
the
power
to
distinguish
have
become
weakened
i
know
of
an
child
who
after
dinner
had
gone
looking
for
chestnuts
with
a
man
in
the
evening
it
came
home
happy
but
woke
up
in
tears
and
confessed
that
the
man
in
question
had
raped
it
another
case
concerns
a
great
burglary
which
had
caused
its
victims
considerable
excitement
the
second
day
after
the
event
the
ten
or
daughter
of
the
victim
asserted
with
certainty
that
she
had
recognized
the
son
of
a
neighbor
among
the
thieves
in
both
cases
there
were
serious
legal
steps
taken
against
the
suspects
and
in
both
cases
the
children
finally
admitted
after
much
thinking
that
they
had
possibly
dreamed
the
whole
matter
of
their
complaints
the
of
such
cases
is
the
fact
that
the
children
do
not
make
their
assertions
immediately
but
after
one
or
two
nights
have
passed
hence
whenever
this
occurs
one
must
entertain
at
least
the
suspicion
that
reality
and
dreams
have
been
confused
similarly
taine
narrates
that
baillarger
once
dreamed
that
he
had
been
made
director
of
a
certain
journal
and
believed
it
so
definitely
that
he
told
it
to
a
number
of
people
then
there
is
the
familiar
dream
of
julius
scaliger
leibnitz
writes
that
scaliger
had
praised
in
verse
the
famous
men
of
verona
in
dream
he
saw
a
certain
brugnolus
who
complained
that
he
had
been
forgotten
later
son
joseph
discovered
that
there
really
had
been
a
brugnolus
who
had
distinguished
himself
as
grammarian
and
critic
obviously
scaliger
senior
had
once
known
and
had
completely
forgotten
about
him
in
this
case
the
dream
had
been
just
a
refreshing
of
the
memory
such
a
dream
may
be
of
importance
but
is
unreliable
and
must
be
dealt
with
carefully
to
get
at
a
point
of
departure
concerning
the
nature
of
the
sleep
and
the
dreams
of
any
given
person
we
may
classify
them
with
reference
to
the
following
propositions
the
vividness
of
dreams
increases
with
their
frequency
the
lighter
the
sleep
the
more
frequent
the
dreams
women
sleep
less
profoundly
than
men
and
hence
dream
more
with
increasing
age
dreams
become
rarer
and
sleep
less
profound
who
sleeps
lightly
needs
less
sleep
the
feminine
need
of
sleep
is
greater
i
might
add
with
regard
to
the
last
point
that
the
fact
that
women
are
better
able
to
endure
nursing
children
or
invalids
constitutes
only
an
apparent
contradiction
of
this
point
the
need
of
sleep
is
not
decreased
but
the
goodwill
and
the
joy
of
sacrifice
is
greater
in
woman
than
in
man
the
extraordinary
things
people
do
in
and
in
sleep
are
numerously
exemplified
by
jessen
most
of
them
are
taken
from
the
older
literature
but
are
quite
reliable
a
comparison
indicates
that
such
somnambulistic
conduct
occurs
most
frequently
among
the
younger
more
powerful
people
who
have
not
slept
for
two
successive
nights
and
then
have
been
awakened
from
deep
sleep
it
is
remarkable
that
they
often
act
intelligently
under
such
circumstances
that
the
physician
writes
the
proper
prescription
or
the
factory
superintendent
gives
the
proper
orders
but
neither
knows
anything
about
it
later
on
criminalistically
their
significance
lies
on
the
one
hand
in
the
fact
that
they
can
be
investigated
with
regard
to
their
correctness
and
on
the
other
that
they
occur
to
people
who
had
no
reason
to
falsify
if
a
defendant
tells
about
some
such
experience
we
lack
the
means
and
the
power
to
make
an
accurate
examination
of
the
matter
and
tend
for
this
reason
to
disbelieve
him
moreover
his
very
position
throws
doubt
upon
his
statements
but
this
is
just
the
ground
for
a
careful
study
of
similar
occurrences
in
trustworthy
people
all
authorities
agree
that
actions
during
sleepiness
occur
almost
always
in
the
first
deep
sleep
disturbed
by
dreams
of
strong
individuals
an
important
circumstance
is
the
phenomenon
cited
by
jessen
and
others
the
capacity
of
some
people
to
fall
calmly
asleep
in
spite
of
tremendous
excitement
thus
napoleon
fell
into
deep
sleep
during
the
most
critical
moment
at
leipzig
this
capacity
is
sometimes
cited
as
evidence
of
innocence
but
it
is
not
convincing
we
have
yet
to
mention
the
peculiar
illusions
of
the
phenomena
of
movement
which
occur
just
before
falling
asleep
panum
tells
how
he
once
inhaled
ether
and
then
observed
lying
in
bed
how
the
pictures
on
the
wall
went
further
and
further
back
came
forward
and
withdrew
again
and
again
similar
things
happen
to
sleepy
people
thus
the
preacher
in
church
seems
progressively
to
withdraw
and
return
the
criminalistic
significance
of
such
illusions
may
be
in
the
observation
of
movements
by
people
who
are
falling
asleep
of
thieves
who
seemed
to
be
approaching
the
beds
though
standing
still
that
sleeping
people
may
be
influenced
in
definite
ways
is
indubitable
cases
are
mentioned
in
which
sleepers
could
be
made
to
believe
any
story
they
would
dream
of
it
and
later
on
believe
it
there
is
in
this
connection
the
story
of
the
officer
who
acquired
the
love
of
a
young
girl
in
this
fashion
the
girl
had
shown
definite
distaste
for
him
at
first
but
after
he
had
told
her
during
her
sleep
in
her
presence
of
his
love
and
loyalty
she
began
in
the
course
of
time
to
return
it
it
is
a
fact
that
certain
of
our
burglars
believe
similar
things
and
carry
them
out
in
most
cases
with
the
assistance
of
red
light
to
which
they
assign
hypnotic
power
they
claim
that
with
a
lantern
with
red
glass
they
are
able
to
do
anything
in
the
room
containing
a
sleeping
individual
and
can
intensify
his
sleep
by
letting
the
red
light
fall
on
his
face
and
speaking
to
him
softly
curiously
enough
this
is
corroborated
by
a
custom
of
our
mountain
lads
they
cover
a
lantern
with
a
red
cloth
and
go
with
it
to
the
window
of
a
sleeping
girl
it
is
asserted
that
when
the
red
light
falls
on
the
face
and
it
is
suggested
to
her
softly
to
go
along
she
does
so
then
a
pointed
stone
is
placed
in
the
way
she
steps
on
it
it
wakes
her
up
and
the
crude
practical
joke
is
finished
it
would
be
interesting
at
least
to
get
some
scientific
information
concerning
these
cited
effects
of
red
light
upon
sleeping
people
m√∂nnigshoff
and
piesbergen
have
thrown
some
light
on
the
profoundness
of
sleep
why
a
person
hears
a
thing
today
and
not
at
another
time
why
one
is
awakened
and
another
not
why
one
is
apparently
deaf
to
very
loud
noise
etc
these
authorities
found
that
the
profundity
of
sleep
culminates
in
the
third
quarter
of
the
second
hour
sleep
intensifies
and
grows
deeper
until
the
second
quarter
of
the
second
hour
in
the
second
and
third
quarters
of
that
hour
the
intensification
is
rapid
and
significant
and
then
it
decreases
just
as
rapidly
until
the
second
quarter
of
the
third
hour
at
that
point
sleep
becomes
less
and
less
profound
until
morning
in
the
second
half
of
the
fifth
hour
at
this
moment
the
intensity
of
sleep
begins
again
to
increase
but
in
contrast
with
the
first
increase
is
very
light
and
takes
a
long
time
sleep
then
reaches
its
culmination
in
one
hour
out
of
five
and
a
half
from
that
it
decreases
until
it
reaches
the
general
level
of
sleep
section
b
intoxication
apart
from
the
pathological
conditions
of
intoxication
especially
the
great
intolerance
toward
alcohol
which
are
the
proper
subjects
for
the
physician
there
is
a
large
group
of
the
stigmata
of
intoxication
which
are
so
various
that
they
require
a
more
accurate
study
than
usual
of
their
causes
and
effects
as
a
rule
people
are
satisfied
to
determine
the
degree
of
intoxication
by
the
answers
to
a
few
stereotyped
questions
did
the
man
wabble
while
walking
was
he
able
to
run
could
he
talk
coherently
did
he
know
his
name
did
he
recognize
you
did
he
show
great
strength
an
affirmative
answer
to
these
questions
from
two
witnesses
has
been
enough
to
convict
a
man
as
a
rule
this
conviction
is
justified
and
it
is
proper
to
say
that
if
a
person
is
still
sufficiently
in
control
of
himself
to
do
all
these
things
he
must
be
considered
capable
of
understanding
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
but
this
is
not
always
the
case
i
do
not
say
that
irrationality
through
drink
must
always
obtain
when
the
drunkard
is
unable
to
remember
what
happened
while
he
was
drunk
his
inability
is
not
determinative
because
the
circumstances
following
a
deed
have
no
reflex
effect
even
if
after
the
deed
a
person
is
ignorant
of
what
he
has
done
it
is
still
possible
that
he
was
aware
of
its
nature
while
committing
it
and
this
possibility
is
the
determinative
factor
but
the
knowledge
of
what
is
being
done
does
not
in
itself
make
the
doer
responsible
for
if
the
drunkard
beats
the
policeman
he
knows
that
he
is
fighting
somebody
he
could
not
do
so
without
knowing
it
and
what
excuses
him
is
the
fact
that
while
he
was
drunk
he
was
not
aware
that
he
was
fighting
a
policeman
that
so
far
as
he
is
capable
of
judgment
at
all
he
judges
himself
to
be
opposed
to
some
illegal
enemy
against
whom
he
must
defend
himself
if
it
be
said
in
opposition
that
a
drunkard
is
not
responsible
if
he
does
when
drunk
what
he
would
not
do
when
sober
this
again
would
be
an
exaggeration
why
is
shown
by
the
many
insults
the
many
revelations
of
secrets
the
many
new
friendships
of
slight
intoxication
these
would
not
have
occurred
if
the
drunkard
had
been
sober
and
yet
nobody
would
say
that
they
had
occurred
during
a
state
of
irresponsibility
hence
we
can
say
only
that
intoxication
excuses
when
an
action
either
follows
directly
and
solely
as
the
reflex
expression
of
an
impulse
or
when
the
drunkard
is
so
confused
about
the
nature
of
his
object
that
he
thinks
himself
justified
in
his
conduct
hence
the
legal
expressions
of
austrian
criminal
law
and
of
the
german
imperial
criminal
statute
book
will
in
practice
be
pushed
one
degree
higher
up
than
ordinary
usage
intends
for
complete
intoxication
or
drunkenness
into
loss
of
consciousness
usually
means
that
condition
in
which
the
individual
lies
stiff
on
the
ground
but
in
this
condition
he
can
not
do
anything
and
is
incapable
of
committing
a
crime
it
must
follow
that
the
statutes
could
not
have
been
thinking
of
this
but
of
the
condition
in
which
the
individual
is
still
active
and
able
to
commit
crimes
by
the
use
of
his
limbs
but
absolutely
without
the
control
of
those
limbs
if
we
compare
innumerable
stories
that
are
told
with
verbal
reliability
about
drunkards
or
those
that
are
readable
in
daily
papers
police
news
and
in
legal
texts
we
find
groups
in
which
a
drunkard
makes
his
bed
on
a
wintry
night
on
a
snow
bank
undresses
himself
carefully
folds
his
clothes
beside
him
and
runs
away
at
the
approach
of
a
policeman
climbs
over
a
fence
and
runs
so
fast
that
he
can
not
be
caught
such
a
man
certainly
has
not
only
the
use
of
his
organs
but
also
uses
them
with
comparative
correctness
in
undressing
folding
his
clothes
and
in
running
away
if
now
somebody
should
pass
the
lair
and
if
he
should
think
that
a
burglar
is
in
his
house
and
should
wound
the
who
would
believe
the
drunkard
when
he
tells
this
story
in
the
street
there
is
frequent
opportunity
of
observing
some
of
the
arrests
of
drunkards
who
fight
with
fists
and
feet
and
teeth
and
often
have
to
be
taken
to
the
police
station
in
a
now
if
the
man
has
had
the
misfortune
of
recognizing
the
policeman
in
his
first
opposition
and
of
giving
his
own
name
properly
we
say
that
he
has
definite
signs
of
responsibility
and
we
sentence
him
but
in
most
cases
it
was
merely
the
instantaneous
illumination
of
his
cindery
mind
which
was
perhaps
stimulated
to
the
recognition
of
the
policeman
and
the
pronunciation
of
his
name
by
the
rather
bearish
remarks
which
then
dies
away
as
swiftly
as
it
rose
and
is
followed
by
instinctive
anybody
who
has
frequently
observed
how
utterly
senseless
is
the
battle
of
a
drunkard
with
the
overwhelming
power
of
three
or
four
or
more
people
and
how
he
continues
to
struggle
even
when
wholly
or
completely
conquered
must
feel
convinced
that
such
a
man
is
no
longer
responsible
in
the
same
way
we
must
never
forget
that
the
prosecution
of
some
very
habitual
activity
is
in
no
sense
evidence
of
responsibility
especially
when
some
action
has
very
limits
and
the
actor
knows
that
a
false
grip
will
result
in
questionable
consequences
the
habitual
movement
will
be
made
instinctively
the
soldier
will
properly
carry
out
his
obligations
of
service
the
coachman
drive
home
unharness
and
look
after
the
horses
even
the
locomotive
engineer
will
complete
his
difficult
task
without
a
break
then
however
they
fall
and
sleep
their
drunkenness
off
now
if
something
intervenes
unexpectedly
during
the
performance
of
this
habitual
activity
especially
some
opposition
some
superfluous
cajolement
correction
or
similar
thing
the
intoxicated
actor
is
thrown
completely
out
of
gear
and
can
not
be
restored
to
it
nor
is
he
able
properly
to
oppose
this
obstacle
hence
he
acts
against
it
reflexly
and
in
most
cases
explosively
it
may
be
perceived
that
such
a
drunkard
works
unconsciously
having
been
thrown
out
of
gear
by
some
sudden
remark
he
is
unable
to
complete
what
he
is
trying
to
do
and
this
develops
a
despairing
expression
of
emotion
for
which
he
is
decidedly
not
responsible
a
countless
number
of
popular
maxims
indicate
the
popular
opinion
that
it
is
best
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
a
drunkard
never
to
help
him
because
he
can
best
look
after
himself
the
public
seems
to
know
this
very
well
theoretically
but
in
practice
no
wife
applies
this
theory
when
her
drunken
husband
comes
home
in
practice
the
policeman
looks
after
the
drunkard
in
practice
the
peasant
and
the
master
quarrel
with
the
drunken
servant
and
the
apprentice
and
then
everybody
wonders
when
suddenly
superiors
are
hurt
maimed
and
otherwise
opposed
the
best
evidence
for
the
certain
but
very
definite
routine
in
which
the
drunkard
moves
is
the
example
cited
by
combe
concerning
the
porter
who
while
drunk
had
wrongly
delivered
a
packet
later
on
he
could
not
think
where
he
had
brought
it
but
as
by
chance
he
got
drunk
again
he
fetched
the
packet
and
brought
it
to
its
proper
destination
this
process
indicates
that
the
vino
depends
not
merely
on
speech
but
on
action
and
that
this
coming
to
the
surface
of
what
is
really
thought
is
the
reason
for
so
many
insults
offered
during
intoxication
such
phenomena
are
best
studied
at
the
beginning
of
narcosis
in
which
all
the
conditions
of
intoxication
come
together
in
a
much
briefer
period
of
time
and
hence
appear
much
more
clearly
how
involuntarily
the
inmost
thought
breaks
through
under
such
circumstances
is
shown
by
an
occurrence
in
a
surgical
clinic
an
old
peasant
was
to
have
been
subjected
to
a
not
dangerous
but
rare
operation
the
famous
surgeon
of
the
university
had
one
student
after
another
make
a
diagnosis
and
asked
one
student
after
another
what
kind
of
an
operation
he
would
perform
the
peasant
misunderstood
it
altogether
and
as
he
was
half
stupefied
he
cried
out
involuntarily
old
donkey
is
asking
one
loafer
after
another
what
to
do
nobody
knows
anything
and
yet
they
are
going
to
operate
on
things
that
are
thought
are
expressed
just
as
involuntarily
during
intoxication
and
thus
the
insults
are
accomplished
what
is
never
believed
but
yet
may
be
true
is
the
defence
of
a
prisoner
that
intoxication
led
him
to
steal
i
know
of
a
talented
kindly
and
thoroughly
honorable
young
man
who
during
slight
intoxication
steals
everything
he
can
lay
his
hands
on
his
drunkenness
is
so
light
that
he
can
remove
with
complete
skill
his
cigarette
cases
pocket
handkerchiefs
and
worst
of
all
their
latchkeys
at
the
same
time
he
is
still
drunk
enough
to
have
great
difficulty
in
remembering
the
next
day
who
the
owners
of
these
things
are
now
suppose
a
thief
told
such
a
story
in
court
i
cite
from
the
excellent
account
of
hoffbauer
the
development
of
intoxication
first
the
consumption
of
liquor
intensifies
the
feeling
of
physical
health
or
increases
that
health
it
appears
to
have
a
proportionately
similar
effect
upon
the
powers
of
the
mind
ideas
move
easily
expression
is
smoother
and
more
adequate
the
condition
and
emotional
attitude
are
such
that
one
might
very
well
always
wish
for
self
and
friends
until
this
point
no
intoxication
is
visible
the
flow
of
ideas
only
increases
and
becomes
more
intense
excellent
appropriate
notions
occur
to
one
but
there
is
effort
to
restrain
the
irregular
flow
of
thought
this
state
is
visible
in
the
effort
which
must
be
used
to
carry
on
any
rather
involved
story
the
ideas
flow
too
rapidly
to
be
easily
ordered
according
to
the
requirements
of
the
story
at
this
point
the
beginning
of
intoxication
is
already
perceptible
in
its
development
the
flow
of
ideas
becomes
continually
stronger
the
senses
lose
their
ordinary
sharpness
and
as
these
fail
the
imagination
grows
stronger
the
language
is
now
at
least
in
particular
expressions
and
turns
of
speech
more
voluminous
and
poetical
and
rather
louder
than
is
natural
the
former
indicates
an
intensification
of
imaginative
power
and
the
latter
a
dulling
of
the
senses
which
becomes
more
and
more
obvious
in
the
development
of
the
intoxication
for
the
drinker
speaks
louder
because
he
hears
his
words
less
clearly
than
before
and
judges
the
hearing
of
his
auditors
by
his
own
although
the
vividness
and
the
more
rapid
flow
of
ideas
induced
by
intoxication
have
a
share
in
this
soon
the
dulling
of
the
senses
becomes
still
more
obvious
for
example
it
is
seen
that
a
person
who
is
so
drunk
that
he
confuses
otherwise
companions
even
if
only
for
a
minute
thinks
he
puts
his
glass
softly
on
the
table
although
it
falls
to
the
ground
and
then
there
are
still
other
forms
of
physical
helplessness
to
be
perceived
from
his
speech
it
may
be
judged
that
the
connection
between
his
ideas
has
significantly
decreased
although
still
very
vivid
they
are
now
like
luminous
sparks
that
appear
and
disappear
this
vividness
of
ideas
or
their
rapid
flow
gives
the
desires
an
unmanageable
intensity
which
reason
can
no
longer
control
he
follows
them
instantaneously
if
some
accident
does
not
turn
him
aside
his
physical
helplessness
becomes
now
obvious
in
stammering
in
a
wabbly
gait
until
finally
he
falls
into
a
deep
sleep
in
which
physical
and
intellectual
repair
begin
the
conditions
of
intoxication
were
to
be
divided
into
periods
we
should
have
the
following
in
the
first
period
of
intoxication
ideas
have
only
an
extraordinary
degree
of
vividness
the
rule
of
the
understanding
over
actions
is
not
altogether
suppressed
so
that
the
drunken
fellow
is
fully
conscious
of
his
external
relations
and
is
aware
of
what
is
going
on
within
and
about
him
but
the
rapid
flow
of
ideas
hinders
careful
reflection
and
leads
to
an
intensified
excitability
particularly
to
those
emotional
expressions
which
are
characterized
by
the
more
rapid
flow
this
is
due
to
the
familiar
psychological
law
according
to
which
one
emotional
condition
leads
into
another
as
it
is
more
like
that
other
in
tone
anger
and
merriment
hence
show
themselves
more
and
more
among
uneducated
people
who
are
not
habituated
to
the
limitation
of
their
emotional
expression
by
reference
to
the
forms
of
the
world
of
fashion
without
this
control
every
stimulation
intensifies
the
emotion
since
every
natural
expression
adds
to
its
vividness
the
irritability
taken
in
itself
is
at
this
stage
less
dominant
inasmuch
as
the
drinker
is
at
the
same
time
satisfied
with
himself
and
the
makes
the
irritability
endurable
only
some
accidental
circumstance
can
intensify
and
spread
this
irritability
such
circumstances
intensify
the
liveliness
and
lead
to
the
outbreak
of
merriment
approximating
upon
hilarity
then
to
a
verbal
quarrel
which
need
not
yet
be
a
real
quarrel
and
may
be
conducted
in
all
friendship
it
seems
that
in
most
cases
the
irritability
is
excited
through
the
fact
that
the
speedily
lapses
or
that
he
is
disturbed
in
doing
things
about
which
he
is
conceited
now
so
long
as
the
intoxication
does
not
exceed
this
stage
its
effects
and
the
outbreaks
of
its
passions
may
be
suppressed
the
drinker
is
here
still
and
is
not
likely
to
lose
control
of
himself
unless
he
is
progressively
excited
thereto
the
next
period
of
intoxication
the
drunkard
still
has
his
senses
although
all
in
all
they
are
considerably
weaker
than
usual
and
he
is
somewhat
beside
himself
memory
and
understanding
have
quite
left
him
hence
he
acts
as
if
the
present
moment
were
the
only
one
the
idea
of
the
consequences
of
his
actions
having
no
effect
upon
him
because
he
no
longer
sees
the
connection
between
the
two
and
since
his
whole
past
has
disappeared
from
his
mind
he
can
not
consider
his
more
remote
circumstances
he
acts
therefore
as
he
might
if
the
memories
of
his
circumstances
and
ideas
of
the
consequences
of
his
actions
did
not
control
his
conduct
and
lead
him
to
rule
himself
the
slightest
excitation
may
awaken
all
his
strongest
passion
which
then
carry
him
away
again
the
slightest
excuse
may
turn
him
from
what
he
has
in
mind
in
this
condition
he
is
much
more
dangerous
to
himself
and
others
because
he
is
impelled
not
only
by
the
irresistible
force
of
his
passions
but
because
also
he
rarely
knows
what
he
is
doing
and
must
be
considered
a
pure
fool
the
last
period
the
drunkard
has
so
lost
his
senses
that
he
has
no
more
idea
of
his
external
with
regard
to
particular
conditions
it
may
be
held
that
the
quantity
of
drink
is
indifferent
apart
from
the
fact
that
we
know
nothing
about
the
quantity
of
alcohol
a
man
has
taken
when
we
hear
merely
about
so
and
so
many
liters
of
wine
or
so
and
so
much
brandy
the
influence
of
quantities
is
individual
and
no
general
rule
whatever
can
be
laid
down
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
young
and
powerful
men
who
may
become
quite
foolish
on
half
a
glass
of
wine
especially
when
they
are
angry
frightened
or
otherwise
excited
and
there
are
weak
old
people
who
can
carry
unbelievable
quantities
in
short
the
question
of
quantity
is
altogether
foolish
the
appearance
and
constitution
of
an
individual
offers
as
little
ground
for
inference
as
quantity
the
knowledge
of
a
regular
attitude
toward
the
consumption
of
alcohol
is
a
safer
guide
hellenbach
asserts
that
wine
has
always
the
same
influence
on
the
same
individual
one
always
becomes
more
loquacious
another
more
silent
a
third
more
sad
a
fourth
merrier
and
up
to
a
certain
limit
this
is
true
but
there
is
always
the
question
of
what
the
limit
is
inasmuch
as
many
individuals
pass
through
different
emotional
conditions
at
different
stages
it
often
happens
that
a
person
in
the
first
stage
who
wants
to
the
world
and
kiss
everybody
may
change
his
mood
and
become
dangerous
thus
anybody
who
has
seen
him
several
times
in
the
first
stage
may
make
the
mistake
of
believing
that
he
can
not
pass
it
in
this
direction
explanations
must
be
made
very
carefully
if
they
are
not
to
be
false
and
deceptive
it
is
important
also
to
know
how
a
man
drinks
it
is
known
that
a
small
quantity
of
wine
can
intoxicate
if
it
is
soaked
up
with
bread
which
is
repeatedly
dipped
into
the
wine
wine
drunk
in
the
cellar
works
with
similar
vigor
if
one
laughs
is
merry
is
vexed
while
drinking
or
if
a
large
variety
of
drinks
is
taken
or
if
they
are
taken
on
an
empty
stomach
for
the
various
effects
of
alcohol
and
for
its
effects
on
the
same
person

different
conditions

the
effect
of
alcohol
on
memory
is
remarkable
in
so
far
as
it
often
happens
that
many
people
lose
their
memory
only
with
respect
to
a
single
very
narrow
sphere
many
are
able
to
remember
everything

everything

to
bear
in
mind
the
problem
of
characteristic
suggestion
the
influence
of
the
judge
on
the
witnesses
the
witnesses
upon
each
other
the
conditions
upon
the
witnesses
and
this
influence
not
through
persuasion
imagination
citation
but
through
those
still
unexplained
remote
effects
which
may
be
best
compared
with
suggestion
is
as
widespread
as
language
we
receive
suggestions
through
the
stories
of
friends
through
the
examples
of
strangers
through
our
physical
condition
through
our
food
through
our
small
and
large
experiences
our
simplest
actions
may
be
due
to
suggestion
and
the
whole
world
may
appear
subject
to
the
suggestion
of
a
single
individual
as
emerson
says
somewhere
nature
carries
out
a
task
by
creating
a
genius
for
its
accomplishment
if
you
follow
the
genius
you
will
see
what
the
world
cares
about
this
multiple
use
of
the
word
has
destroyed
its
early
intent
that
made
it
equivalent
to
the
term
the
older
criminalists
had
a
notion
of
the
truth
and
have
rigorously
limited
the
putting
of
suggestive
questions
at
the
same
time
mittermaier
knew
that
the
questioner
was
frequently
unable
to
avoid
them
and
that
many
questions
had
to
suggest
their
answers
if
for
example
a
man
wants
to
know
whether
a
had
made
a
certain
statement
in
the
course
of
a
long
conversation
he
must
ask
for
good
or
evil
a
said
that
attitude
toward
the
problem
shows
that
he
had
already
seen
years
ago
that
suggestive
questions
of
this
sort
are
the
most
harmless
and
that
the
difficulty
really
lies
in
the
fact
that
witnesses
experts
and
judges
are
subject
especially
in
great
and
important
cases
to
the
influence
of
public
opinion
of
newspapers
of
their
own
experiences
and
finally
of
their
own
fancies
and
hence
give
testimony
and
give
judgments
in
a
way
less
guided
by
the
truth
than
by
these
influences
this
difficulty
has
been
made
clear
by
the
berchthold
in
m√ºnchen
in
which
the
excellent
psychiatrists
and
grashey
had
their
hands
full
in
answering
and
avoiding
questions
about
witnesses
under
the
influence
of
suggestion
the
development
of
this
trial
showed
us
the
enormous
influence
of
suggestion
on
witnesses
and
again
how
contradictory
are
the
opinions
concerning
the
determination
of
its
value
whether
it
is
to
be
determined
by
the
physician
or
by
the
judge
and
finally
how
little
we
know
about
suggestion
anyway
everything
is
assigned
to
suggestion
in
spite
of
the
great
literature
we
still
have
too
little
material
too
few
observations
and
no
scientifically
certain
inferences
tempting
as
it
is
to
study
the
influence
of
suggestion
upon
our
criminalistic
work
it
is
best
to
wait
and
to
give
our
attention
mainly
to
observation
study
