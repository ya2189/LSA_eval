preface
this
volume
the
fifth
of
the
woman
institute
library
of
cookery
deals
with
the
varieties
of
fruits
and
the
desserts
that
can
be
made
from
them
the
canning
and
preserving
of
foods
the
making
of
confections
of
every
description
beverages
and
their
place
in
the
diet
and
every
phase
of
the
planning
of
meals
with
fruits
becoming
less
seasonal
and
more
a
daily
food
an
understanding
of
them
is
of
great
value
to
the
housewife
in
and
fruit
she
first
learns
their
place
in
the
diet
their
nature
composition
and
food
value
then
she
proceeds
with
the
preparation
and
serving
of
every
variety
of
fruit
included
in
this
section
also
are
fruit
cocktails
those
refreshing
appetizers
often
used
to
introduce
a
special
meal
to
understand
how
to
preserve
perishable
foods
in
the
seasons
of
plenty
for
the
times
when
they
are
not
obtainable
is
a
valuable
part
of
a
housewife
knowledge
and
deals
with
two
ways
of
preserving
foodstuffs
treating
carefully
the
equipment
needed
and
all
the
methods
that
can
be
employed
and
showing
by
means
of
excellent
illustrations
one
of
them
in
natural
colors
every
part
of
the
procedure
followed
the
fruits
and
vegetables
that
permit
of
canning
as
well
as
certain
meats
and
fish
are
taken
up
in
a
systematic
manner
making
preserving
and
continues
a
discussion
of
the
home
preservation
of
foods
showing
how
they
can
be
kept
for
long
periods
of
time
not
by
sterilization
but
with
the
aid
of
preservatives
each
one
of
these
methods
is
treated
as
to
its
principles
equipment
and
the
procedure
to
be
followed
after
trying
the
numerous
recipes
given
the
housewife
will
be
able
to
show
with
pride
the
results
of
her
efforts
for
nothing
adds
more
to
the
attractiveness
and
palatability
of
a
meal
than
a
choice
jelly
conserve
marmalade
or
jam
deals
with
that
very
delightful
and
fascinating
part
of
cookery
confection
making
not
only
are
confections
cheaper
than
commercially
made
ones
but
they
usually
contain
more
wholesome
materials
so
it
is
to
the
housewife
advantage
to
familiarize
herself
with
the
making
of
this
food
recipes
are
given
for
all
varieties
of
confections
including
taffies
caramels
cream
candies
and
the
confections
related
to
them
fondant
making
is
treated
in
detail
with
illustrations
showing
every
step
and
directions
for
making
many
unusual
kinds
though
beverages
often
receive
only
slight
consideration
they
are
so
necessary
that
the
body
can
not
exist
very
long
without
them
in
is
discussed
the
relation
of
beverages
to
meals
the
classes
of
beverages
and
the
preparation
of
those
required
by
the
human
system
as
well
as
the
proper
way
to
serve
them
in
addition
to
coffee
tea
cocoa
chocolate
and
cereal
beverages
fruit
soft
and
nourishing
drinks
receive
their
share
of
attention
to
be
a
successful
home
maker
it
is
not
enough
for
a
housewife
to
know
how
to
prepare
food
she
must
also
understand
how
to
buy
it
how
to
look
after
the
household
accounts
what
constitutes
correct
diet
for
each
member
of
her
family
how
to
plan
menus
for
her
regular
meals
and
for
special
occasions
and

fruit
in
the
diet
fruit
as
is
generally
understood
is
the
fleshy
juicy
product
of
some
plant
or
tree
which
when
ripe
is
suitable
for
use
as
food
although
some
fruits
are
seedless
they
generally
contain
the
seeds
of
the
plants
or
trees
that
produce
them
many
fruits
require
cooking
to
make
them
palatable
others
are
never
cooked
and
still
others
may
be
cooked
or
eaten
raw
as
desired
fruits
because
they
are
wholesome
appetizing
and
attractive
occupy
a
valuable
place
in
the
diet
in
fact
it
is
these
qualities
rather
than
their
food
value
that
accounts
for
the
popularity
of
fruits
among
all
people
in
addition
to
causing
fruits
to
appeal
to
the
esthetic
sense
their
attractiveness
serves
another
important
purpose
it
is
said
that
nature
made
them
attractive
in
color
odor
and
flavor
in
order
that
birds
might
be
allured
to
attack
them
for
food
and
by
spreading
the
seeds
assist
in
their
propagation
fruits
are
gradually
growing
to
be
less
seasonal
and
more
a
daily
food
and
are
thus
constantly
becoming
more
prevalent
in
the
diet
this
condition
may
be
attributed
to
the
present
rapid
means
of
transportation
and
the
excellent
methods
of
cold
storage
that
exist
through
these
agencies
it
is
possible
to
ship
more
or
less
perishable
fruits
long
distances
from
their
native
localities
and
at
times
of
the
year
other
than
the
particular
season
in
which
they
are
at
their
best
in
the
places
where
they
are
grown
thus
fruits
that
were
formerly
considered
a
luxury
may
now
be
served
regularly
even
on
the
tables
of
persons
having
only
moderate
means
the
fact
that
fruits
are
being
more
extensively
used
every
day
is
as
it
should
be
for
this
food
is
entitled
to
an
important
place
in
the
diet
of
all
persons
so
important
is
fruit
in
the
diet
that
it
must
be
looked
on
not
as
one
of
the
things
that
may
be
taken
or
omitted
as
a
person
wishes
without
making
any
difference
either
way
but
as
a
food
to
include
in
one
form
or
another
in
nearly
every
meal
the
child
who
is
so
young
that
it
can
not
take
any
solid
food
may
have
fruit
juices
included
in
its
diet
to
decided
advantage
but
children
who
are
slightly
older
and
adults
may
take
the
fruits
cooked
or
raw
instead
of
in
the
form
of
juices
as
far
as
the
composition
of
fruits
is
concerned
it
is
such
that
most
fresh
fruits
are
not
particularly
high
in
food
value
however
they
are
characterized
by
other
qualities
that
make
up
for
what
they
lack
in
this
respect
then
too
what
they
contain
in
the
way
of
or
material
is
easily
digestible
most
fruits
contain
considerable
acid
and
this
food
substance
makes
them
stimulating
to
the
appetite
advantage
of
this
fact
is
taken
when
fruits
are
served
at
the
beginning
of
a
breakfast
or
when
several
of
them
are
combined
in
a
fruit
cocktail
and
served
before
luncheon
or
dinner
this
acid
produces
real
stimulation
in
the
stomach
resulting
in
a
flow
of
gastric
juice
from
the
glands
of
the
stomach
walls
in
addition
the
delightful
color
the
fragrant
odor
or
the
pleasant
taste
of
fruit
although
a
mental
effect
is
just
as
real
and
just
as
valuable
as
the
actual
stimulation
of
the
acids
many
fruits
are
eaten
raw
while
others
are
cooked
either
because
they
require
cooking
to
make
them
appetizing
or
because
it
is
desired
not
to
use
them
in
their
raw
state
the
cooking
of
fruits
has
a
variety
of
effects
on
them
being
sometimes
advantageous
and
other
times
detrimental
the
flavor
is
always
changed
by
the
application
of
heat
and
in
some
cases
the
acid
that
fruit
contains
becomes
stronger
on
the
other
hand
the
fibrous
material
or
cellulose
of
fruits
is
softened
by
cooking
and
thus
becomes
more
digestible
then
too
the
sugar
that
is
usually
added
to
fruits
in
their
cooking
increases
their
food
value
because
of
these
facts
cooked
fruits
have
considerable
value
and
like
raw
fruits
should
have
an
important
place
in
the
diet
those
fruits
which
are
dried
and
usually
eaten
raw
such
as
figs
and
dates
supply
much
nourishment
in
an
easily
digestible
form
the
medicinal
value
of
fruit
has
long
been
considered
to
be
of
importance
but
this
may
be
almost
entirely
disregarded
for
with
the
exception
of
the
fact
that
most
fruits
are
valuable
as
a
laxative
there
is
nothing
to
consider
however
several
fruits
such
as
blackberries
and
bananas
have
an
effect
and
large
quantities
of
these
should
for
the
most
part
be
avoided
especially
in
the
feeding
of
children
in
general
fruits
are
divided
into
two
classes
namely
food
fruits
and
flavor
fruits
as
their
names
imply
are
valuable
as
food
whereas
are
those
distinguished
by
a
characteristic
flavor
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
flavors
as
well
as
the
odors
of
fruits
are
due
chiefly
to
what
is
known
as
their
volatile
or
ethereal
oils
fruits
in
which
these
oils
are
very
strong
are
often
irritating
to
certain
persons
and
cause
distress
of
some
sort
after
eating
in
this
section
it
is
the
purpose
to
acquaint
the
housewife
with
the
relative
value
and
uses
of
the
various
kinds
of
fruit
to
teach
her
the
best
methods
of
preparation
and
to
supply
her
with
recipes
that
will
encourage
her
to
make
greater
use
of
this
valuable
food
in
her
diet
in
this
discussion
however
the
general
classification
of
fruits
is
not
followed
instead
the
various
fruits
are
arranged
alphabetically
under
the
headings
berries
fruits
citrus
fruits
tropical
fruits
melons
and
dried
fruits
in
order
to
simplify
matters
while
it
is
hardly
possible
to
use
fruits
too
extensively
they
must
not
be
allowed
to
take
the
place
of
other
more
nourishing
foods
that
are
required
by
the
body
therefore
in
order
to
make
proper
use
of
them
their
value
in
the
diet
should
not
be
overlooked
nature
of
fruits
advance
in
fruit
cultivation
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
distinguish
between
vegetables
and
fruits
for
instance
the
tomato
is
in
reality
a
fruit
but
it
is
commonly
used
as
a
vegetable
and
rhubarb
is
more
of
a
vegetable
than
a
fruit
but
it
is
always
used
as
a
fruit
it
can
therefore
be
seen
that
the
line
between
vegetables
and
fruits
is
not
clearly
drawn
it
is
well
to
remember
that
fruit
is
usually
the
edible
pulpy
mass
covering
the
seeds
of
various
plants
and
trees
and
that
it
is
generally
cooked
or
eaten
raw
with
sugar
whereas
vegetables
are
seldom
sweetened
in
cooking
great
strides
have
been
made
in
the
cultivation
of
fruit
many
varieties
that
formerly
grew
wild
are
now
commonly
cultivated
most
of
the
cultivated
fruits
are
superior
to
the
same
kind
in
the
wild
state
at
least
in
size
and
appearance
but
often
there
seems
to
be
a
loss
of
flavor
through
cultivation
some
fruits
that
were
almost
inedible
in
their
wild
state
on
account
of
containing
so
many
seeds
have
been
made
seedless
also
through
varieties
of
fruit
different
from
what
formerly
existed
have
been
obtained
an
example
of
such
fruit
is
the
loganberry
which
is
a
cross
between
a
red
raspberry
and
a
blackberry
and
retains
many
of
the
qualities
of
each
however
some
small
fruits
such
as
blueberries
or
huckleberries
are
still
grown
wild
and
marketed
only
from
their
wild
source
while
fruit
is
usually
improved
by
cultivation
there
has
been
a
tendency
through
this
means
to
produce
fruits
that
will
stand
up
for
long
periods
of
time
so
that
they
may
be
marketed
at
great
distances
from
the
place
where
they
are
grown
for
instance
apples
especially
those
found
in
the
market
in
the
spring
and
other
fruits
which
look
very
fine
will
many
times
be
found
to
have
a
tough
skin
and
to
be
almost
tasteless
in
general
fruits
of
delicate
flavor
and
texture
can
not
be
kept
very
long
after
they
have
ripened
to
stand
shipping
they
must
be
picked
in
their
green
stage
then
if
they
are
kept
in
the
right
temperature
they
will
ripen
after
picking
bananas
that
are
to
be
shipped
a
long
distance
are
picked
when
perfectly
green
but
by
the
time
the
consumer
buys
them
they
are
usually
well
ripened
in
addition
to
bananas
a
few
other
tropical
fruits
are
shipped
out
of
their
native
climates
in
small
numbers
and
are
sold
at
very
high
prices
however
many
tropical
fruits
can
not
be
shipped
to
the
northern
states
because
of
their
perishable
nature
composition
and
food
value
of
fruits
composition
of
fruits
the
composition
of
fruits
is
a
matter
of
considerable
importance
for
on
it
the
food
value
of
the
fruits
depends
to
a
certain
extent
the
composition
of
all
fruits
is
the
same
but
the
varieties
of
this
food
differ
in
their
food
values
almost
as
greatly
as
do
vegetables
many
of
them
are
extremely
low
in
this
respect
while
a
few
of
them
are
rather
high
in
order
to
determine
the
place
that
fruit
should
have
in
a
meal
it
is
necessary
to
obtain
a
definite
idea
of
the
composition
as
well
as
the
food
value
of
the
different
varieties
protein
and
fat
in
such
small
quantities
of
protein
and
fat
are
contained
in
fruits
that
very
little
attention
need
be
given
to
these
substances
exceptions
are
found
in
avocados
or
alligator
pears
and
in
ripe
olives
both
of
which
are
high
in
fat
then
too
there
is
a
small
amount
of
protein
in
grapes
and
some
other
fruits
but
it
is
not
sufficient
to
merit
consideration
carbohydrate
in
whatever
food
value
fruits
may
have
whether
it
be
high
or
low
is
due
to
the
carbohydrate
they
contain
some
green
fruits
and
bananas
contain
a
very
small
amount
of
starch
but
on
the
whole
the
carbohydrate
of
fruits
is
in
the
form
of
sugar
and
is
in
solution
in
the
fruit
juices
the
chief
form
of
this
carbohydrate
is
known
as
or
however
another
form
of
sugar
is
also
found
in
nearly
all
fruits
grapes
and
dried
fruits
such
as
figs
raisins
containing
an
unusually
large
amount
in
addition
is
contained
in
the
majority
of
fruits
is
also
a
carbohydrate
that
is
found
in
large
quantities
in
some
fruits
while
in
other
fruits
it
is
lacking
this
substance
is
related
to
the
gums
and
to
cellulose
although
it
is
one
of
the
carbohydrates
from
which
no
food
value
is
derived
it
is
of
considerable
importance
because
it
is
responsible
for
the
properties
of
fruits
in
fruits
that
are
not
fully
matured
or
in
other
words
green
fruits
the
sugar
has
not
developed
to
so
great
an
extent
as
it
has
in
perfectly
ripe
fruits
consequently
such
fruits
are
not
so
high
in
food
value
as
they
are
when
they
become
ripe
as
is
well
known
it
is
the
sugar
of
fruits
that
accounts
for
their
sweet
taste
for
the
sweeter
the
fruits
the
more
sugar
and
the
less
acid
they
contain
the
quantity
of
this
substance
varies
from
per
cent
in
lemons
to
per
cent
in
some
other
fresh
fruits
such
as
plums
in
dried
fruits
the
amount
of
sugar
is
much
higher
reaching
as
high
as
per
cent
or
even
more
in
such
fruits
as
figs
dates
and
raisins
cellulose
in
in
fruits
as
in
vegetables
cellulose
is
found
in
varying
quantities
the
larger
the
quantity
the
lower
will
be
the
food
value
of
the
fruit
except
where
the
water
has
been
evaporated
as
in
the
case
of
dried
fruits
the
digestibility
of
this
cellulose
however
is
not
worth
considering
for
while
it
is
possible
that
small
amounts
of
very
young
and
tender
cellulose
from
fruits
may
be
digested
on
the
whole
this
characteristic
may
be
disregarded
the
skins
and
seeds
of
fruits
as
well
as
the
coarse
material
that
helps
to
make
up
the
pulp
are
known
as
refuse
and
are
treated
as
such
by
the
human
digestive
tract
but
it
is
to
this
waste
material
or
cellulose
that
the
laxative
quality
of
fruit
is
largely
due
in
cases
where
there
are
digestive
or
intestinal
troubles
it
is
often
necessary
to
remove
the
cellulose
before
the
fruit
is
eaten
the
coarse
material
may
be
removed
and
that
which
is
more
tender
may
be
broken
up
by
pressing
the
fruit
through
a
sieve
or
a
strainer
of
some
kind
the
cooking
of
fruits
is
another
means
of
making
the
cellulose
in
them
more
easily
digested
for
it
softens
or
disintegrates
the
various
particles
of
the
indigestible
material
when
fruit
is
taken
for
its
laxative
effect
and
the
irritation
of
the
cellulose
needs
no
consideration
the
skins
of
the
fruits
may
be
eaten
instead
of
being
rejected
however
to
avoid
any
trouble
they
should
be
well
chewed
minerals
in
all
fruits
contain
a
certain
percentage
of
mineral
salts
the
quantity
varies
in
the
different
kinds
of
fruits
but
it
averages
about
per
cent
these
salts
have
the
opposite
effect
on
the
blood
from
those
found
in
meats
and
cereals
but
they
act
in
much
the
same
way
as
the
minerals
of
vegetables
in
other
words
they
have
a
tendency
to
render
the
blood
more
alkaline
and
less
acid
they
are
therefore
one
of
the
food
constituents
that
help
to
make
fruit
valuable
in
the
diet
and
should
be
retained
as
far
as
possible
in
its
preparation
in
fact
any
method
that
results
in
a
loss
of
minerals
is
not
a
good
one
to
adopt
in
the
preparation
of
fruits
the
minerals
commonly
found
in
fruits
are
iron
lime
sodium
magnesium
potash
and
phosphorus
these
are
in
solution
in
the
fruit
juices
to
a
very
great
extent
and
when
the
juices
are
extracted
the
minerals
remain
in
them
acids
in
some
fruits
contain
only
a
small
amount
of
acid
while
others
contain
larger
quantities
it
is
these
acids
together
with
the
sugar
and
the
volatile
oils
of
fruits
that
constitute
the
entire
flavor
of
this
food
most
ripe
fruits
contain
less
acid
than
unripe
ones
and
cooked
fruits
are
often
higher
in
acid
than
the
same
fruits
when
raw
numerous
kinds
of
acid
are
found
in
the
different
varieties
of
fruits
for
example
lemons
oranges
grapefruit
and
a
few
other
fruits
belonging
to
the
class
known
as
citrus

effect

on
there
is
a
very
marked
difference
between
ripe
and
green
fruits
as
to
their
composition
flavor
texture
palatability
and
digestibility
green
fruits
containing
more
acid
than
ripe
ones
serve
some
purposes
for
which
ripe
fruits
of
the
same
variety
can
not
be
used
so
well
for
instance
a
very
much
better
jelly
can
be
made
from
grapes
that
are
not
entirely
ripe
than
from
those
which
have
completely
ripened
green
fruits
contain
less
sugar
than
do
ripe
ones
and
so
they
are
more
sour
to
the
taste
in
some
cases
the
carbohydrate
found
in
green
fruits
is
partly
in
the
form
of
starch
which
in
the
process
of
development
is
changed
to
sugar
the
cellulose
of
green
fruits
especially
that
distributed
throughout
the
pulp
of
the
fruit
itself
is
usually
tougher
and
harder
than
that
which
is
found
in
the
same
fruit
after
it
has
ripened
digestibility
of
the
ripeness
and
freshness
of
fruits
determine
their
digestibility
to
a
great
extent
but
the
peculiarities
of
each
person
have
much
to
do
with
this
matter
many
times
a
particular
fruit
will
agree
with
almost
every
one
but
a
few
exceptional
persons
and
for
no
apparent
reason
except
their
own
peculiarities
of
digestion
it
disagrees
very
badly
with
them
abnormal
conditions
of
the
alimentary
tract
however
can
not
be
taken
into
consideration
in
a
general
discussion
on
the
digestibility
of
foods
for
it
is
a
subject
that
can
not
be
treated
except
from
a
dietetic
standpoint
a
safe
rule
to
follow
when
a
fruit
is
found
to
disagree
with
a
person
is
to
omit
it
from
that
person
diet
this
need
not
prove
a
hardship
for
the
wide
range
or
variety
of
fruits
makes
it
possible
to
find
one
or
more
kinds
that
will
agree
with
each
person
as
has
been
explained
sugar
is
the
food
material
from
which
the
nutritive
value
of
fruits
is
obtained
with
the
exception
of
a
few
predigested
foods
manufactured
in
such
a
way
that
they
can
be
digested
easily
this
sugar
is
probably
the
most
easily
digested
form
of
food
that
can
be
obtained
this
substance
being
held
in
solution
in
the
fruit
juices
which
are
encased
in
a
cellulose
covering
depends
to
some
extent
for
its
digestion
on
the
hardness
of
the
cellulose
when
this
covering
is
old
and
hard
or
green
and
tough
as
the
case
may
be
it
is
difficult
for
the
digestive
juices
to
break
through
and
attack
the
sugar
contained
inside
as
this
difficulty
is
not
encountered
when
fruit
is
fresh
and
ripe
its
freshness
and
ripeness
become
important
factors
in
digestibility
cooking
is
also
an
important
factor
because
it
softens
the
cellulose
but
there
are
certain
other
changes
made
by
cooking
that
must
be
taken
into
consideration
as
well
effect
of
cooking
on
cooking
affects
fruits
in
numerous
ways
depending
on
the
condition
of
the
fruit
itself
the
method
used
and
the
length
of
time
the
heat
is
applied
when
fruits
are
cooked
in
water
or
in
a
thin
sirup
the
cellulose
becomes
softened
on
the
other
hand
if
they
are
cooked
in
a
heavy
sirup
as
for
instance
in
the
making
of
preserves
the
cellulose
becomes
hardened
and
the
fruit
instead
of
breaking
up
remains
whole
or
nearly
so
and
becomes
tough
and
hard
in
texture
the
addition
of
quantities
of
sugar
as
in
the
latter
case
besides
helping
to
keep
the
fruit
whole
increases
its
food
value
another
change
that
usually
takes
place
when
fruit
is
cooked
is
in
its
flavor
this
change
is
due
either
to
an
increase
in
the
acid
contained
in
the
fruit
or
to
a
decrease
in
the
amount
of
sugar
some
authorities
believe
that
cooking
increases
the
amount
of
acid
while
others
hold
the
view
that
when
fruit
is
cooked
without
removing
the
skins
and
seeds
the
acid
contained
in
the
seeds
and
skins
and
not
noticeable
when
the
fruit
is
fresh
is
released
during
the
cooking
such
is
undoubtedly
the
case
with
plums
the
change
that
is
brought
about
in
the
sugar
by
the
cooking
of
fruits
consists
in
changing
the
cane
sugar
into
levulose
and
dextrose
which
are
not
so
sweet
this
change
accounts
for
the
fact
that
some
cooked
fruits
are
less
sweet
than
others
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
acid
does
not
seem
to
be
increased
in
addition
to
producing
certain
changes
in
fruit
cooking
if
done
thoroughly
renders
fruits
sterile
as
it
does
other
foods
that
is
it
kills
any
bacteria
that
the
fruits
may
contain
advantage
of
this
fact
is
taken
when
fruits
are
canned
for
future
use
although
most
persons
prefer
raw
fruit
to
that
which
is
cooked
there
are
some
who
object
to
eating
this
food
raw
but
who
are
not
always
certain
as
to
the
reason
for
their
objection
like
other
raw
foods
fruits
in
their
fresh
state
contain
that
is
a
substance
that
helps
to
keep
the
body
in
a
healthy
normal
condition
these
are
found
to
some
extent
in
cooked
fruits
but
not
in
the
same
quantity
as
in
raw
ones
consequently
as
much
use
as
possible
should
be
made
of
raw
fruits
in
the
diet
fruits
and
their
preparation
as
food
preparing
and
serving
required
sanitary
since
large
quantities
of
fruits
are
eaten
raw
it
is
necessary
that
they
be
handled
in
the
most
sanitary
manner
if
disease
from
their
use
be
prevented
however
they
are
often
in
an
unsanitary
condition
when
they
reach
the
housewife
for
instance
they
become
contaminated
from
the
soiled
hands
of
the
persons
who
handle
them
from
the
dirt
deposited
on
them
during
their
growth
from
the
fertilizer
that
may
be
used
on
the
soil
from
flies
and
other
insects
that
may
crawl
over
them
and
from
being
stored
displayed
or
sold
in
surroundings
where
they
may
be
exposed
to
the
dirt
from
streets
and
other
contaminating
sources
because
of
the
possibility
of
all
these
sources
of
contamination
it
is
essential
that
fruits
that
are
not
to
be
cooked
be
thoroughly
washed
before
they
are
eaten
it
is
true
that
a
certain
amount
of
flavor
or
food
material
may
be
lost
from
the
washing
but
this
is
of
little
importance
compared
with
the
possibility
of
preventing
disease
washing
the
manner
of
washing
fruits
depends
largely
on
the
nature
of
the
fruit
fruits
that
have
a
sticky
surface
such
as
raisins
figs
and
dates
usually
have
to
be
washed
in
several
waters
hard
fruits
such
as
pears
apples
plums
should
be
washed
with
running
water
berries
and
softer
fruits
require
more
careful
procedure
it
usually
being
advisable
to
pour
them
into
a
pan
containing
water
and
then
after
stirring
them
around
in
the
water
until
all
dirt
is
removed
take
them
from
the
water
rather
than
pour
the
water
from
them
in
any
event
all
fruits
eaten
raw
should
be
properly
washed
serving
while
the
serving
of
fruits
is
a
simple
matter
it
should
be
done
in
as
dainty
a
way
as
possible
so
as
not
to
detract
from
their
natural
attractiveness
if
the
skins
are
to
remain
on
the
fruits
while
serving
a
knife
preferably
a
fruit
knife
should
be
served
with
them
and
nothing
smaller
than
a
salad
plate
should
be
used
the
carefully
washed
leaves
of
the
fruit
served
make
an
attractive
garnish
for
instance
large
perfect
strawberries
with
the
stems
on
when
heaped
on
a
plate
garnished
with
strawberry
leaves
and
served
with
a
small
dish
of
powdered
sugar
are
always
attractive
likewise
a
bunch
of
grapes
served
on
grape
leaves
never
fails
to
attract
a
mixture
of
a
number
of
fruits
such
as
peaches
pears
and
plums
or
in
winter
oranges
bananas
and
apples
piled
in
a
large
bowl
and
passed
after
salad
plates
have
been
distributed
not
only
makes
an
excellent
dessert
but
permits
the
persons
served
to
take
their
choice
fresh
berries
sliced
peaches
bananas
oranges
etc
may
be
served
in

dishes
which
should
be
placed
on
a
service
plate
they
may
be
passed
or
served
from
a
bowl
by
the
hostess
canned
or
stewed
fruits
may
be
served
in
the
same
way
berries
nature
and
care
berries
are
among
the
most
perishable
fruits
and
begin
to
come
into
market
early
in
the
summer
season
in
most
localities
the
berry
season
begins
with
strawberries
and
ends
with
blackberries
because
the
numerous
varieties
are
somewhat
juicy
and
soft
and
therefore
extremely
perishable
they
will
not
stand
shipping
and
storage
for
long
periods
of
time
the
quality
of
berries
depends
much
on
the
nature
of
the
season
as
well
as
on
the
locality
in
which
the
berries
are
grown
if
there
is
a
good
supply
of
rain
the
berries
will
be
very
moist
containing
a
large
amount
of
pulp
in
proportion
to
seeds
and
skins
but
if
the
season
is
very
dry
the
berries
are
likely
to
be
less
moist
and
consequently
less
palatable
a
general
use
of
berries
and
to
almost
every
one
the
most
important
is
the
making
of
jams
jellies
and
preserves
in
the
preparation
of
berries
for
the
table
they
should
be
handled
as
little
as
possible
in
order
to
prevent
them
from
breaking
up
and
losing
their
shape
after
being
purchased
they
should
be
kept
where
it
is
cool
until
they
are
to
be
used
it
is
advisable
not
to
wash
them
until
just
before
serving
as
the
extra
handling
usually
bruises
them
and
causes
them
to
spoil

good
varieties
of
cultivated
blackberries

the
best
for

in

are

be
used

if
the

are
to

most
successfully
in

they
must
be
picked
before
they

the
use

is
not

or
are
eaten
for

where

used
in

up
various
dessert
dishes
very
little
preparation
is
necessary
in
getting
blackberries
ready
to

they
should
simply
be

blueberries

state
are
a
berry
blue
or
in
color
although
belonging
to
a
different
class
are
commonly
regarded
as
blueberries
by
many
persons
berries
of
this
kind
occur
in
many
varieties
some
grow
on
low
bushes
close
to
the
ground
others
are
found
on
taller
bushes
and
still
others
grow
on
very
tall
bushes

grow
in

ground
in

mountainous
region
others

soil
berries
of
this
class
are
not
so
perishable
as
most
other
berries
but
in
many
localities
they
can
not
be
purchased
at
all
for
as
a
rule
they
are
used
only
in
the
immediate
vicinity
in
which
they
grow
blueberries
have
small
seeds
and
coarse
tough
skins
they
contain
very
little
acid
but
are
excellent
for
pies
and
sauce
however
they
will
make
jelly
very
well
if
there
are
a
few
partly
ripe
berries
among
them
and
their
flavor
is
improved
if
some
fruit
containing
acid
is
added
to
them

prepare
them
for
use

they
are
to

cranberries
cranberries
grow
wild
in
many
localities
but
most
persons
who
use
them
buy
them
in
the
market
as
a
cultivated
fruit
their
season
begins
in
the
fall
and
lasts
until
early
spring
and
during
this
time
they
can
usually
be
obtained
in
the
market
they
contain
considerable
acid
and
consequently
require
a
great
deal
of
sugar
to
make
them
sufficiently
sweet
to
be
palatable
they
are
more
often
served
as
an
accompaniment
to
a
dinner
course
especially
with
turkey
or
other
poultry
than
eaten
as
a
sauce
at
times
they
are
used
in
the
making
of
muffins
pudding
and
various
kinds
of
pastry
one
of
the
advantages
of
cranberries
is
that
they
keep
very
well
in
the
raw
state
however
before
they
are
cooked
they
should
be
looked
over
carefully
freed
of
any

material

raspberries

but
they

into
several
excellent
desserts
and
they
are
also
much
used
for
canning
and
preserving
they
are
a
perishable
fruit
and
so
do
not
keep
well

of
their
softness
they
have
to

miscellaneous
berries
currants
come
in
three
varieties
red
white
and
black
they
are
not
often
eaten
fresh
but
are
generally
utilized
for
making
jellies
jams
and
preserves
or
for
pastry
and
pies
when
they
are
to
be
used
for
jelly
it
is
not
necessary
to
pick
them
from
the
stems
as
they
may
be
washed
and
cooked
on
their
stems
some
varieties
of
currants
are
dried
and
these
are
used
extensively
in
the
making
of
cakes
cookies
etc
the
usefulness
of
this
fruit
as
a
food
is
not
so
great
as
many
others
no
recipes
are
given
for
it
because
of
its
little
use
in
the
fresh
form
gooseberries
like
currants
are
somewhat
limited
in
their
variety
of
uses
being
seldom
used
except
for
jelly
preserves
and
pies
before
gooseberries
are
ripe
they
are
light
green
in
color
and
rather
sour
in
taste
but
as
they
ripen
the
amount
of
acid
they
contain
decreases
so
that
they
become
sweet
in
flavor
and
change
to
green
gooseberries
are
often
canned
for
pies
and
when
in
this
state
or
when
partly
ripe
they
are
also
made
up
into
many
kinds
of
preserves
and
jelly
in
their
preparation
for
these
uses
both
the
stems
and
the
blossom
ends
should
be
removed
as
a
rule
berries
of
this
kind
keep
very
well
and
stand
considerable
handling
because
their
outside
skin
is
very
tough

are
a
fruit
produced
by

mature
early
in

summer

the
late
apples
can
be
kept
during
the
entire
winter
if
they
are
properly
stored
but
the
summer
varieties
must
generally
be
used
immediately
as
they
do
not
have
good
keeping
qualities
in
each
locality
in
which
apples
are
grown
a
few
varieties
seem
to
be
especially
popular
and
are
used
to
the
exclusion
of
others
some
apples
are
good
for
one
purpose
and
some
for
another
for
instance
many
that
are
excellent
if
eaten
raw
are
not
good
for
cooking
purposes
and
others
that
cook
well
are
not
suitable
for
eating
it
is
therefore
a
good
idea
for
the
housewife
to
become
familiar
with
the
varieties
of
apples
raised
in
her
community
and
to
learn
the
use
to
which
each
kind
can
be
put
to
advantage

they
can

plums
are
among

strong
acid
fruits
some
varieties
of
them
seem
to
be
more
tart
after
they
are
cooked
than
before
but
as
already
explained
this
condition
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
acid
contained
in
the
skin
and
around
the
seeds
is
liberated
during

rhubarb
rhubarb
is
in
reality
not
a
fruit
but
it
is
always
considered
as
such
because
it
is
cooked
with
sugar
and
served
as
a
fruit
it
has
the
advantage
of
coming
early
in
the
spring
before
there
are
many
fruits
in
the
market
as
it
contains
a
large
quantity
of
oxalic
acid
it
is
very
sour

must
be
cooked
with
considerable
sugar

become
palatable
the
addition
of
which

the
food
value
of
cooked
rhubarb
very
high
rhubarb
is
much
used
for
pies

is
frequently
canned
for
sauce
it

also
used
as
a
cheap

a
more
expensive

the
stems
of
some
varieties
of
rhubarb
are
characterized
by
a
great
deal
of
red
color
while
others
are
entirely
green
the
red
rhubarb
makes
a
more
attractive
dish
when
it
is
cooked
and
served
than
the
green
but
it
has
no
better
flavor
the
outside
of

a
skin
that
may
be
removed
by
catching
hold
of
it
at
one
end
with

stripping
it
off
the
remainder
of
the
stem
it
is
not
necessary
to
remove
the
skin
from
young
and
tender
rhubarb
but
it
is
often
an
advantage
to
remove
it
from
rhubarb

these
characteristics
together
with
the
fact
that

it
possible
to

the

few
of
them
however
such
as
lemons
and
limes
contain
very
little
sugar
and
considerable
acid
and
are
therefore
extremely
sour
in
the
use
of
such
varieties
sugar
must
be
added
to
make
them
palatable
the
greatest
use
made
of
citrus
fruits
is
that
of
serving
them
raw
however
they
are
also
used
in
the
making
of

such
confections
as

fruits
then
too
the
juice
of
a
number
of

refreshing
beverages

it
is
possible
to
obtain
them
in

good
condition
it
should
be
remembered
however
that

until
all
the
green
color
has
left
the
skin
the
stem
of
the
bunch
may
be

but
the
bananas
themselves
should
be
perfectly
yellow
black
spots
which
are
sometimes
found
on
the
skins
indicate
overripeness
or
bruises
when
the
spots
come
from
overripeness
however
they
do
not
injure
the
quality
of
the
fruit
unless
there
are
a
great
many
of
them
in
fact
many
persons
consider
that
bananas
are
better
when
the
skins
are
black
than
at
any
other
time
just
under
the
skin
of
the
banana
is
some
pithy
material
that
clings
to
the
outside
of
the
fruit
and
that
has
a
pungent
disagreeable
taste
this
objectionable
taste
may
be
done
away
with
by
scraping
the
surface
of
the
banana
slightly
as
shown
in
fig
after
the
skin
is
removed
the
strong
typical
flavor
that
characterizes
bananas
is
due
to
the
volatile
oil
they
contain
it
is
this
oil
that
causes
bananas
to
disagree
with
some
persons
the
common
yellow
variety
has
a
milder
flavor
than
red
bananas
and
certain
other
kinds
and
consequently
is
more
popular
if
the
oil
of
bananas
does
not
prove
irritating
much
use
should
be
made
of
this
fruit
because
its
food
value
is
high
being
about
double
that
of
apples
and
oranges
illustration

bananas
are
eaten
raw
more
often
than
in
any
other
way

many
persons
find
cooked
bananas
very
agreeable
then
too
it
is
sometimes
claimed
that
cooked
bananas
are
more
digestible
than
raw
ones
because
of
the
starch
that
bananas
contain
however
this
argument
may
be
discounted
for

they
vary
in

the
age
of
the
plants
it
requires
from
to
months
for

fruit
to
develop
and

lemon
will
flavor
a
greater
amount
of
food
than
any
other
fruit
combined
another
characteristic
of
pineapples
is
that
they
contain
a
ferment
that
acts
upon
protein
material
and
therefore
is
sometimes
thought
to
aid
considerably
in
the
digestion
of
food
the
probabilities
are
that
this
ferment
really
produces
very
little
action
in
the
stomach
but
its
effect
upon
protein
material
can
readily
be
observed
by
attempting
to
use

pineapple
in
the
making
of
a
gelatine
dessert

the
pineapple
is

the

salads
again
the
pulp
may
be
partly
scraped
out

varieties
of

the
fruits
that
have
been
discussed
up
to
this
point
are
fresh
fruits
that
is
they
are
placed
on
the
markets
and
consequently
can
be
obtained
in
their
fresh
state
however
there
are
a
number
of
fruits
that
are
dried
before
they
are
put
on
the
market
and
as
they
can
be
obtained
during
all
seasons
they
may
be
used
when
fresh
fruits
are
out
of
season
or
as
a
substitute
for
canned
fruits
when
the
household
supply
is
low
the
chief
varieties
of
dried
fruits
are
dates
figs
prunes
which
are
dried
plums
and
raisins
which
are
dried
grapes
apples
apricots
and
peaches
are
also
dried
in

discussions
of
the
different
varieties
of

are
here
given
together
with
recipes
showing
how
some
of
them
may
be
used
dates
dates
which
are
the
fruit
of
the
date
palm
are
not
only
very
nutritious
but
well
liked
by
most
persons
they
are
oblong
in
shape
and
have
a
single
hard
seed
that
is
grooved
on
one
side
as
dates
contain
very
little
water
and
a
great
deal
of
sugar
their
food
value
is
high
being
more
than
five
times
that
of
apples
and
oranges
they
are
also
valuable
in
the
diet
because
of
their
slightly
laxative
effect
when
added
to
other
food
such
as
cakes
hot
breads
they
provide
a
great
deal
of
nutriment
the
finest
dates
on
the
market
come
from
turkey
and
the
eastern
countries
they
are
prepared
for
sale
at
the
places
where
they
grow
being
put
up
in
packages
that
weigh
from
to
pound
as
well
as
in
large
boxes
from
which
they
can
be
sold
in
bulk
it
is
very
important
that
all
dates
whether
bought
in
packages
or
in
bulk
be
thoroughly
washed
before
they
are
eaten
while
those
contained
in
packages
do
not
collect
dirt
after
they
are
packed
they
are
contaminated
to
a
certain
extent
by
the
hands
of
the
persons
who
pack
them
to
be
most
satisfactory
dates
should
first
be
washed
in
hot
water
and
then
have
cold
water
run
over
them
if
they
are
to
be
stuffed
they
should
be
thoroughly
dried
between
towels
or
placed
in
a
single
layer
on
pans
to
allow
the
water
to
evaporate
while
the
washing
of
dates
undoubtedly
causes
the
loss
of
a
small
amount
of
food
material
it
is
nevertheless
a
wise
procedure
dates
can
be
put
to
many
valuable
uses
in
the
diet
they
are
much
used
in
cakes
muffins
and
hot
breads
and
in
fillings
for
cakes
and
cookies
several
kinds
of
delicious
pastry
as
well
as
salads
and
sandwiches
are
also
made
with
dates
their
use
as
a
confection
is
probably
the
most
important
one
as
they
are
very
appetizing
when
stuffed
with
nuts

the
varieties

not
especially
valuable
when
they
are

they
can
be

the
localities

necessity
for

the
various
methods
of

perishable
foods
in
the

for
winter
use
originated
because
of
necessity
in
localities
where
the
seasons
for
fruits
and
vegetables
are
short
the
available
supply
in
early
times
was
limited
to
its
particular
season
then
foods
had
to
be
preserved
in
some
way
to
provide
for
the
season
of
scarcity
it
was
not
possible
as
it
is
now
to
obtain
foods
in
all
parts
of
the
country
from
localities
that
produce
abundantly
or
have
long
seasons
because
there
were
no
means
of
rapid
transportation
no
cold
storage
nor
no
commercial
canning
industries
in
the
small
towns
and
farming
communities
the
first
preservation
methods
for
meats
as
well
as
for
fruits
and
vegetables
were
pickling
curing
drying
and
preserving
not
until
later
was

known
it
was
this
preserving
of
foodstuffs
in
the

that
led
to
the
manufacture
and
commercial
canning
of
many
kinds
of
edible
materials
these
industries
however
are
of
comparatively
recent
origin
the
first
canning
of

commercially
having
been
done
in

about
a
hundred
years
ago
at
that
time
glass
jars
were
utilized
but
it
was
not
until
tin
cans
came
into
use
later
in
england
that
commercial
canning
met
with
much
favor
both
canning
in
the
home
and
commercial
canning
have
had
many
drawbacks
chief
among
which
was
spoiling
it
was
believed
that
the
spoiling
of
canned
foods
was
due
to
the
presence
of
air
in
the
jars
or
cans
and
it
is
only
within
the
last
years
that
the
true
cause
of
spoiling
namely
the
presence
of
bacteria
has
been
understood
since
that
time
methods
of
canning
that
are
much
more
successful
have
been
originated
and
the
present
methods
are
the
result
of
the
study
of
bacteria
and
their
functions
in
nature
it
is
now
definitely
known
that
on
this
knowledge
depends
the
success
of
the
various
canning
methods
since
commercial
canning
provides
nearly
every
kind
of
foodstuff
and
since
cold
storage
and
rapid
transportation
make
it
possible
to
supply
almost
every
locality
with
foods
that
are
out
of
season
it
has
not
been
deemed
so
necessary
to
preserve
foods
in
the
home
nevertheless
the
present
day
brings
forth
a
new
problem
and
a
new
attitude
toward
the
home
preservation
of
foods
there
are
three
distinct
reasons
why
foods
should
be
preserved
in
the
home
the
first
is
to
bring
about
if
fruits
vegetables
and
other
foods
can
be
procured
at
a
price
that
will
make
it
possible
to
preserve
them
in
the
home
at
a
lower
cost
than
that
of
the
same
foods
prepared
commercially
it
will
pay
from
an
economical
standpoint
the
second
is
to
promote
that
is
to
prevent
the
wasting
of
food
when
fruits
and
vegetables
are
plentiful
the
supply
is
often
greater
than
the
demand
for
immediate
consumption
then
unless
the
surplus
food
is
preserved
in
some
way
for
later
use
there
will
be
a
serious
loss
of
food
material
the
third
is
to
produce
if
the
product
can
be
made
superior
to
that
commercially
preserved
then
even
at
an
equal
or
a
slightly
higher
cost
it
will
pay
to
preserve
food
in
the
home
of
the
methods
of
preserving
perishable
foods
only
two
namely
canning
and
drying
are
considered
in
this
section
before
satisfactory
methods
of
canning
came
into
use
drying
was
a
common
method
of
preserving
both
fruits
and
vegetables
and
while
it
has
fallen
into
disuse
to
a
great
extent
in
the
home
much
may
be
said
for
its
value
drying
consists
merely
in
evaporating
the
water
contained
in
the
food
and
with
the
exception
of
keeping
it
dry
and
protected
from
vermin
no
care
need
be
given
to
the
food
in
storage
in
the
preparation
of
dried
food
for
the
table
it
is
transformed
into
its
original
composition
by
the
addition
of
water
in
which
it
is
usually
soaked
and
then
cooked
the
drying
of
food
is
simple
and
no
elaborate
equipment
is
required
for
carrying
out
the
process
dried
food
requires
less
space
and
care
in
storage
than
food
preserved
in
any
other
way
and
both
paper
and
cloth
containers
may
be
used
in
storing
it
when
storage
space
is
limited
or
when
there
is
a
very
large
quantity
of
some
such
food
as
apples
or
string
beans
that
can
not
be
used
or
canned
at
once
it
is
advisable
to
dry
at
least
a
part
of
them
when
used
in
combination
with
canning
drying
offers
an
excellent
means
of
preserving
foods
and
thus
adding
to
their
variety
canning
has
a
greater
range
of
possibilities
than
drying
a
larger
number
of
foods
can
be
preserved
in
this
way
and
besides
the
foods
require
very
little
preparation
in
some
cases
none
at
all
when
they
are
removed
from
the
cans
practically
every
food
that
may
be
desired
for
use
at
some
future
time
may
be
canned
and
kept
if
the
process
is
carried
out
properly
these
include
the
perishable
vegetables
and
fruits
of
the
summer
season
as
well
as
any
winter
vegetables
that
are
not
likely
to
keep
in
the
usual
way
or
that
are
gathered
while
they
are
immature
many
dishes
may
be
made
up
when
the
ingredients
are
the
most
plentiful
and
canned
to
keep
them
for
the
time
when
they
are
difficult
or
impossible
to
obtain
otherwise
such
foods
are
very
convenient
in
any
emergency
often
too
when
something
is
being
cooked
for
the
table
an
extra
supply
may
be
made
with
no
greater
use
of
fuel
and
very
little
extra
labor
and
if
the
excess
is
canned
it
will
save
labor
and
fuel
for
another
day
in
the
same
way
foods
from
the
table
may
be
preserved
by
reheating
and
canning
them
many
foods
and
combinations
of
foods
may
be
made
ready
for
pies
and
desserts
and
then
canned
it
being
often
possible
to
use
fruits
that
are
inferior
in
appearance
for
such
purposes
soup
may
be
canned
it
may
be
made
especially
for
canning
or
it
may
be
made
in
larger
quantity
than
is
required
for
a
meal
and
the
surplus
canned
for
canning
it
is
an
excellent
plan
to
make
soup
more
concentrated
than
that
which
would
be
served
immediately
as
such
soup
will
require
fewer
jars
and
will
keep
better
water
or
milk
or
the
liquid
from
cooked
vegetables
or
cereals
may
be
added
to
dilute
it
when
it
is
to
be
served
meat
and
fish
also
may
be
canned
and
many
times
it
is
advisable
to
do
this
especially
in
the
case
of
varieties
that
can
not
be
preserved
to
advantage
by
such
methods
as
salting
pickling
or
curing
the
preservation
of
foods
by
canning
and
drying
should
not
be
looked
at
as
an
idea
rather
it
is
a
matter
in
which
the
housewife
should
be
vitally
interested
in
fact
it
is
the
duty
of
every
housewife
to
learn
all
she
can
about
the
best
methods
to
employ
canning
methods
have
been
greatly
improved
within
the
last
few
years
and
it
is
a
wise
plan
to
adopt
the
newer
methods
and
follow
directions
closely
especially
should
this
be
done
if
foods
canned
by
the
older
methods
have
spoiled
or
if
mold
has
formed
on
top
of
the
food
in
the
jars
in
order
to
preserve
foods
successfully
and
with
ease
the
housewife
should
realize
the
importance
of
carrying
out
details
with
precision
and
care
the
exactness
with
which
the
ingredients
are
measured
the
choice
and
care
of
utensils
the
selection
and
preparation
of
the
food
to
be
canned
all
have
a
direct
bearing
on
whether
her
results
will
be
successful
or
not
by
observing
such
points
and
exercising
a
little
ingenuity
the
economical
housewife
may
provide
both
a
supply
and
a
convenient
variety
of
practical
foods
for
winter
use
for
example
one
single
fruit
or
vegetable
may
be
preserved
in
a
number
of
ways
thus
if
there
is
a
very
large
supply
of
apples
that
will
not
keep
some
may
be
canned
in
large
pieces
some
may
be
put
through
a
sieve
seasoned
differently
and
canned
as
apple
sauce
and
some
may
be
cut
into
small
pieces
and
canned
for
use
in
making
pies
apple
butter
and
various
kinds
of
jams
and
marmalades
may
be
made
of
all
or
part
apples
or
the
apples
may
be
spiced
and
used
as
a
relish
combining
fruits
of
different
flavor
in
canning
also
adds
variety
in
fact
neither
quinces
nor
apples
canned
alone
are
so
delicious
as
the
two
properly
combined
and
canned
together
in
the
same
way
if
the
housewife
will
watch
the
markets
closely
and
make
good
use
of
materials
at
hand
she
may
provide
canned
foods
at
comparatively
little
cost
of
course
the
woman
who
has
a
garden
of
her
own
has
a
decided
advantage
over
the
one
who
must
depend
on
the
market
for
foods
to
can
the
woman
with
access
to
a
garden
may
can
foods
as
soon
as
they
have
been
gathered
and
for
this
reason
she
runs
less
risk
of
losing
them
after
they
have
been
canned
nevertheless
as
has
been
pointed
out
it
is
really
the
duty
of
every
housewife
to
preserve
food
in
the
home
for
the
use
of
her
family
canning
principles
of
canning
canning
consists
in
sealing
foods
in
receptacles
such
as
cans
or
jars
in
such
a
way
that
they
will
remain
sterile
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time
several
methods
of
canning
are
in
use
and
the
one
to
adopt
will
depend
considerably
on
personal
preference
and
the
money
that
can
be
expended
for
the
equipment
in
any
case
successful
results
in
canning
depend
on
the
care
that
is
given
to
every
detail
that
enters
into
the
work
this
means
then
that
from
the
selection
of
the
food
to
be
canned
to
the
final
operation
in
canning
not
one
thing
that
has
to
do
with
good
results
should
be
overlooked
selection
of
food
for
a
careful
selection
of
the
food
that
is
to
be
canned
is
of
great
importance
if
it
is
in
good
condition
at
the
time
of
canning
it
is
much
more
likely
to
remain
good
when
canned
than
food
that
is
not
the
flavor
of
the
finished
product
also
depends
a
great
deal
on
the
condition
of
the
food
fruits
have
the
best
flavor
when
they
are
ripe
but
they
are
in
the
best
condition
for
canning
just
before
they
have
completely
ripened
immediately
following
perfect
ripeness
comes
the
spoiling
stage
and
if
fruits
as
well
as
vegetables
are
canned
before
they
are
completely
ripe
they
are
of
course
farther
from
the
conditions
that
tend
to
spoil
them
this
however
does
not
mean
that
green
fruits
or
vegetables
should
be
canned
whenever
possible
any
food
that
is
to
be
canned
should
be
perfectly
fresh
the
sooner
it
is
canned
after
it
has
been
gathered
the
more
satisfactory
will
be
the
results
for
instance
it
is
better
to
can
it
hours
after
gathering
than
hours
but
to
can
it
hours
after
is
much
better
fruits
such
as
berries
that
are
especially
perishable
should
not
be
allowed
to
stand
overnight
if
this
can
be
prevented
and
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
can
some
vegetables
such
as
peas
beans
and
corn
within
a
very
few
hours
after
gathering
unless
this
is
done
they
will
develop
a
bad
flavor
because
of
a
condition
that
results
from
the
action
of
certain
bacteria
imperfect
fruits
should
not
be
canned
but
should
be
used
for
making
jam
marmalade
or
jelly
why
canned
foods
canned
foods
spoil
because
of
the
action
of
that
cause
fermentation
putrefaction
and
molding
the
reasons
for
the
spoiling
of
food
are
thoroughly
discussed
in
of
part
and
in
that
discussion
canning
is
mentioned
as
one
of
the
means
of
preserving
food
or
preventing
it
from
spoiling
however
when
canning
does
not
prove
effective
it
is
because
undesirable
bacteria
are
present
in
the
food
either
they
have
not
been
destroyed
by
the
canning
process
or
they
have
been
allowed
to
enter
before
the
jar
was
closed
and
have
then
developed
to
such
an
extent
as
to
cause
the
food
to
spoil
odors
flavors
and
gases
result
from
the
putrefaction
fermentation
or
molding
caused
by
these
bacteria
and
these
make
the
foods
offensive
or
harmful
or
perhaps
both
preventing
canned
foods
from
from
what
has
just
been
said
it
will
be
seen
that
the
success
of
canning
depends
entirely
on
destroying
harmful
that
are
present
in
the
food
and
preventing
those
present
in
the
air
from
entering
the
jars
in
which
the
food
is
placed
some
foods
are
more
difficult
to
keep
than
others
because
bacteria
act
on
them
more
readily
and
the
foods
themselves
contain
nothing
that
prevents
their
growth
among
such
foods
are
meat
fish
peas
corn
beans
and
meat
soups
on
the
other
hand
some
foods
contain
acids
that
prevent
the
growth
of
bacteria
and
these
keep
easily
among
these
are
rhubarb
cranberries
and
green
gooseberries
however
foods
that
keep
easily
are
few
and
in
most
cases
extreme
care
in
the
process
of
canning
must
be
exercised
while
warmth
is
necessary
for
bacterial
growth
very
high
temperatures
will
destroy
or
retard
it
in
canning
a
temperature
as
high
as
degrees
fahrenheit
or
boiling
point
retards
the
growth
of
active
bacteria
but
retarding
their
growth
is
not
sufficient
they
must
be
rendered
inactive
to
do
this
requires
either
a
higher
temperature
than
boiling
point
or
long
continued
cooking
at
degrees
are
a
protective
form
that
many
kinds
of
bacteria
assume
under
unfavorable
conditions
they
are
very
difficult
to
kill
and
unless
they
are
completely
destroyed
in
the
canning
process
they
will
develop
into
active
bacteria
when
conditions
again
become
favorable
the
result
of
the
spore
development
is
the
spoiling
of
the
food
other
things
besides
the
application
of
heat
assist
in
the
keeping
of
canned
food
as
for
example
the
acids
of
the
fruits
and
vegetables
themselves
as
has
been
mentioned
the
use
of
sugar
also
assists
the
greater
the
quantity
of
sugar
in
solution
the
easier
it
will
be
to
keep
the
food
this
is
proved
in
the
case
of
jams
and
jellies
which
will
keep
without
being
sealed
tight
or
put
into
jars
immediately
after
cooking
salt
helps
to
keep
vegetables
that
are
canned
and
in
making
butters
conserves
and
pickles
the
spices
and
vinegars
used
help
to
protect
the
foods
from
bacterial
action
however
none
of
these
things
are
essential
to
the
keeping
of
any
by
which
is
meant
food
in
which
all
bacteria
or
sources
of
bacteria
have
been
rendered
inactive
by
the
application
of
sufficient
heat
canning
numerous
compounds
usually
in
the
form
of
powders
are
advertised
as
being
useful
for
keeping
canned
foods
from
spoiling
none
of
them
should
be
used
however
because
they
are
unnecessary
if
the
work
of
canning
is
carefully
and
effectively
done
good
foods
will
keep
perfectly
without
the
addition
of
a
preservative
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
of
many
of
the
states
themselves
forbid
the
use
of
some
preservatives
because
of
their
harmful
effect
on
the
human
system
for
this
reason
to
say
nothing
of
the
extra
expense
that
would
be
incurred
in
their
use
such
preservatives
may
well
be
left
alone
general
equipment
for
canning
the
equipment
required
for
canning
depends
on
two
things
the
quantity
of
food
to
be
canned
at
one
time
and
since
there
are
several
canning
methods
in
use
the
canning
method
that
is
to
be
employed
various
kinds
of
elaborate
equipment
have
been
devised
to
make
the
work
of
canning
easy
as
well
as
effective
however
it
is
possible
to
do
excellent
work
with
simple
equipment
and
if
the
matter
of
expense
must
be
considered
there
should
be
no
hesitation
about
choosing
the
simplest
and
least
expensive
and
doing
the
work
in
the
best
possible
way
with
it
it
is
important
also
that
utensils
already
included
in
the
household
equipment
be
improvised
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
canning
season
as
far
as
possible
whatever
the
canning
method
that
is
to
be
followed
may
be
there
are
a
number
of
utensils
and
containers
that
go
to
make
up
the
general
equipment
that
is
required
familiarity
with
such
an
equipment
is
extremely
necessary
for
correct
results
in
canning
and
for
this
reason
the
general
equipment
is
discussed
here
in
detail
the
special
equipment
needed
for
each
of
the
canning
methods
however
is
not
taken
up
until
the
method
is
considered
in
giving
this
general
equipment
mention
is
made
of
some
utensils
that
are
convenient
but
not
absolutely
necessary
any
unnecessary
but
convenient
part
of
a
canning
equipment
should
therefore
be
chosen
with
a
view
to
its
qualities
and
its
expense
a
device
that
will
make
the
keeping
of
canned
foods
more
certain
and
prevent
loss
may
be
a
valuable
purchase
still
that
which
makes
for
greater
convenience
but
not
absolute
saving
need
not
be
considered
a
necessity
vessels
for
the
pots
kettles
and
pans
in
ordinary
use
in
the
kitchen
for
cooking
purposes
are
usually
satisfactory
for
the
canning
of
foods
those
made
of
tin
or
iron
however
are
not
so
good
as
enameled
ones
or
those
made
of
other
metals
such
as
aluminum
especially
is
this
true
of
utensils
used
for
the
canning
of
acid
fruits
or
vegetables
because
if
such
food
remains
in
contact
with
tin
or
iron
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
the
acid
will
corrode
the
surface
sufficiently
to
give
the
food
a
bad
or
metallic
taste
in
addition
such
utensils
often
give
the
food
a
dark
color
if
enameled
kettles
are
used
for
the
cooking
of
foods
that
are
to
be
canned
it
is
important
that
the
surface
be
perfectly
smooth
and
unbroken
otherwise
it
will
be
difficult
to
prevent
burning

is
convenient
for
picking

out
of

still
another
useful
small
utensil
is
a

the
glass

should
be
used
from

if
possible
but
not
at

such
loss
however
will
depend
on
the
proper
sealing
of
the
jars
provided
everything
up
to
that
point
has
been
correctly
done
all
jars
should
be
carefully
inspected
before
they
are
used
because
imperfect

are
often
responsible

the
most
important
to
consider
in
making
a

jars
that
close
with
difficulty
especially
if
the

not
likely
to
keep

successfully
because

will
have
a
chance
to
enter
and
thus
cause
the

used
for
canning
foods

improved
with
canning
methods
the
jars
had
a
groove
into
which
the

was
poured
into
the
space
surrounding
the

jar
shown
in

this
type
of
jar
has
been
extensively
used
with
excellent
results
both
the
mouth
of
this
jar
and
the
jar
top
which
is
made
of
metal
usually
zinc
lined
with
glass
or
porcelain
have
threads
that
match
and
the
jar
is
sealed
by
placing
the
jar
rubber
over
the
top
or
ridge
of
the
jar
and
then
screwing
the
jar
top
firmly
in
place
such
jars
however
are
more
difficult
to
make
than
some
of
the
newer
types
one
of
these
jars
is
illustrated
in

it
is
provided
with
a
glass
cover
that
fits
on
the
ridge
of
the

and
a
metal
clasp
that
serves
to
hold

another
convenient
and
simple
type
of
glass
jar
known
as

has
a
metal

with
a
rubber

another
improvement
in
jars
is
that

been
enlarged
so
that
large
fruits
and
vegetables
such
as
peaches

can
be
packed
into

it
is
easier
to

as
has
been

the
glass
tops
meet
with
most
favor
of
course
they
are
breakable
but
they
are
even
more
durable
than
metal
tops
which
are
usually
rendered
less
effective
by
the
bending
they
undergo
when
they
are
removed
from
the

covers
made
of
zinc
are
being
rapidly
abandoned
and
it
has
been
proved
that
the
fewer
the

the
more
carefully

it
be

must
be
pierced

flat
when

a
new
supply
of
rubbers
should
be

other
methods
which
are
newer
seem
troublesome
to
the
housewife
who
is
familiar
with
the
method
yet
it
will
only
be
fair
to
give
the
new
methods
a
trial
before
deciding
which
to
use
the
method
has
much
to
recommend
it
foods
canned
in
this
way
undergo
less
change
in
form
and
flavor
than
those
canned
by
the
method
besides
there
is
less
danger
of
spoiling
in
fact
many
foods
such
as
vegetables
and
meats
that
can
not
be
canned
satisfactorily
by
the
method
will
keep
perfectly
if
they
are
carefully
preserved
by
the
method

method
requires
the
use
of
special
equipment
as

very
acceptable
canning

very
simple
and
requires

other
than
that

be
found
in
every

in
thoroughly
cooking

food
that
is

transferring
it
to
containers
and
sealing
them

utensils
are
required
for
the
canning
method
for
cooking
the
food
a
large
enamel
or
metal
vessel
other
than
tin
or
iron
should
be
provided
it
should
be
broad
and
shallow
rather
than
deep
especially
for

as
this
food
retains
its

that
is
not

clean
the
jars

look
it
over
carefully
cut
out
any
decayed
portions
and
wash
it
thoroughly
sometimes
roots
leaves

or
seeds
are
removed
before
washing
and
sometimes
this
is
not
done
until
after
washing
at
any
rate
all
dirt
or
foreign
material
must
be
washed
from
foods
before
they
are
ready
for
canning
after
preparing
the
food
it
must
be
cooked
if
fruit
is
being
canned
put
it
into
the
required
sirup
the
making
of
which
is
explained
later
and
cook
it
until
it
is
well
softened
as
if
preparing
it
for
immediate
table
use
if
vegetables
are
being
canned
cook
them
in
the
same
way
but
use
salt
and
water
instead
of
sirup
when
the
food
is
cooked
transfer
it
to
the
sterile
jars
and
seal
at
once
with
the
sterile
rubbers
and
covers
then
invert
each
jar
to
permit
the
food
to
cool
and
to
test
for
leaks
the
danger
of
not
securing
good
results
with
the
method
lies
in
the
possibility
of
contaminating
the
contents
before
the
jar
is
closed
and
sealed
in
addition
to
having
the
jars
rubbers
and
covers
sterile
therefore
all
spoons
and
other
utensils
used
to
handle
the
cooked
food
must
be
sterile
likewise
the
jars
must
be
filled
to
the
top
and
the
covers
put
on
and
made
as
firm
and
tight
as
possible
at
once
so
that
as
few
bacteria
as
possible
will
enter
if
cans
are
used
the
tops
should
not
be
twisted
or
turned
after
cooling
as
this
may
affect
the
sealing
if
jars
leak
upon
being
turned
upside
down
the
contents
must
be
removed
and
reheated
and
the
jar
must
be
fitted
with
another
cover
then
both
jar
and
cover
must
be
sterilized
and
the
contents
returned
and
sealed
immediately

be
canned
whole
or
in
pieces
of
any
desirable
size
what
to
do
with
them
is
explained
later
when
the
directions
for
canning
the
different
kinds
are
discussed
while
the

is
undergoing
preparation
fill
the
sterilizer
with
hot
water
and
allow
it
to
come
to
the
boiling
point
scalding
and
when
the
food
is
made
ready
the
next
step
is
to
scald
or
blanch
it
scalding
is
done
to
loosen
the
skin
of
such
food
as
peaches
plums
and
tomatoes
so
that
they
may
be
peeled
easily
to
scald
such
fruits
or
vegetables
dip
them
quickly
into
boiling
water
and
allow
them
to
remain
there
just
long
enough
to
loosen
the
skin
if
they
are
ripe
the
scalding
must
be
done
quickly
otherwise
they
will
become
soft
they
should
never
be
allowed
to
remain
in
the
water
after
the
skin
begins
to
loosen
for
scalding
fruits
and
vegetables
a
wire
basket
or
a
square
of
cheesecloth
may
be
used
in
the
manner
shown
in
figs
and
blanching
is
done
to
reduce
the
bulk
of
such
foods
as
spinach
and
other
greens
to
render
them
partly
sterilized
and
to
improve
their
flavor
it
consists
in
dipping
the
food
into
boiling
water
or
suspending
it
over
live
steam
and
allowing
it
to
remain
there
for
a
longer
period
of
time
than
is
necessary
for
scalding
to
blanch
food
place
it
in
a
wire
basket
a
sieve
or
a
piece
of
clean
cheesecloth
and
lower
it
into
boiling
water
or
suspend
it
above

done
partly
to
improve
the
color
of
the
food
it
stops
the
softening
process
at
once
makes
the
food
more
firm
and
thus
easier
to
handle
and
helps
to
loosen
the
skin
of
foods
that
have
been
scalded
it
also
assists
in
destroying
bacteria
by
suddenly
shocking
the
spores
after
the
application
of
heat
in
conjunction
with
blanching
or
scalding
replaces
the
long
process
of
fractional
sterilization
and
is
what
makes
the
method
superior
to
this
other
process
to

simply
plunge
that

has
just
been
scalded

this
little
attention
to

the

enough
steam

firmly
press
it
downwards

melts
and
thus
joins
the
cap
to
the
can
after
the
caps
are
soldered
in
place
the
air
inside
the
cans
must
be
driven
out
through
the
small
vent
or
opening
usually
in
the
center
of
the
cap
and
the
cans
made
therefore
place
the

to
within
inch
of

top
and
let
them
remain
there
for
a
few
minutes
usually
minutes
in

is
sufficient
immediately
after

is
called
apply

after
this
is
done
test
each
can
for
leaks
by
submerging
it
in

if
bubbles
arise
it
is
an
indication
that
the
cover
is
not
tight

must
be
resoldered
the
next
step
consists
in
processing

be
done
either
in

would
be
kept
there
if

is
to
be

keep
the

in
it
for
to
minutes
depending
on
the
steam

employed
the

the
necessity
for
cooking
it
and
the
size
of
the
cans
employed
for
canning
meat
or
fish
processing
in
a
pressure
cooker
is
the
most
successful
as
the
high
temperature
reached
in
it
kills
bacteria
which
are
difficult
to
destroy
at
the
boiling
point
as
soon
as
the
cans
of
food
are
removed
from
the
water
bath
or
the

plunge
them
into
cold
water
to
stop
the
cooking
and
prevent
the
food
from
getting
soft
and
mushy
then
label
the
cans
so
that
no
mistake
will
be
made
as
to
their
contents
in
another

may
be
closed
without

the

method
oven
method
of
canning
is
thought
to
be
very
satisfactory
by
many
housewives
but
as
it
is
necessary
to
remove
the
covers
after
cooking
the
contents
of
the
jars
food
canned
in
this
way
is
subjected
to
contamination
just
as
in
the
method
in
addition
the
jars
are
difficult
to
handle
in
the
oven
owing
to
the
extreme
heat
that
is
required
to
cook
the
food
in
the
jars
in
canning
by
the
oven
method
proceed
by
preparing
the
food
as
for
the
canning
method
also
fill
the
jars
with
fruit
or
vegetables
and
with
liquid
or
sirup
as
in
this
method
put
the
covers
on
the
jars
loosely
omitting
the
jar
rubbers
place
the
jars
in
a
shallow
pan
of
water
as
in
fig
and
set
the
pan
containing
the
jars
into
a
stove
oven
which
should
be
only
slightly
warm
at
the
same
time
place
the
jar
rubbers
in
a
pan
of
boiling
water
so
that
they
may
be
sterilized
as
the
food
cooks
when
the
jars
are
in
the
oven
increase
the
heat
gradually
until
the
food
in
them
boils
then
keep
up
a
temperature
that
will
allow
the
food
to
boil
quietly
for
a
period
long
enough
to
cook
it
soft
and
sterilize
it
usually
to
minutes
after
boiling
has
begun
will
be
sufficient
during
the
cooking
some
of
the
liquid
in
the
jars
evaporates
therefore
when
the
jars
of
food
are
ready
to
be
removed
from
the
oven
have
boiling
water
or
sirup
ready
remove
the
cover
of
each
jar
in
turn
and
fill
the
jar
brimful
with
the
liquid
then
place
a
sterilized
rubber
in
place
and
fasten
the
cover
down
tight
the

from
this

on
is

and
do
it
well

depend
considerably
on
the

of
greater

is
the

eliminate
as
much
as
she
can
the
possibilities
of
contamination
for
as
has

that
everything

should
be
put
out
of

it
does
not
fit
correctly
and
if
a
screw
cover
will
not
screw
down
tight
it
should
be
discarded
without
the
rubber
there
should
be
just
enough

between
the

and
the

to
permit
the
thumb

to
be
inserted
as
is
shown
in

the

should
be
carefully
examined
every

used
so
that
none

chipped
off
will
be
used

this

it
is
wise
to
use
the

it
is
by
the
observance
of
such
precautions
as
these
some
of

seemingly
unimportant
that
the
housewife
will
be

for
her
efforts
in

exceptions
such
foods
canned

be
observed
the
jars
are
full

well
packed
and
the
color
of
each

is
retained
each

directions
for

classification
of
to
simplify
the
directions
here
given
for
the
canning
of

this
food
is
divided
into
four
groups
as
follows
which
include
all
wild
and
cultivated
edible
greens
such
as
beet
greens
collards
cress
dandelion
endive
horseradish
greens
kale
mustard
greens
spinach

and

and
related
which
include

and
ripe

and

which
include

which
include
beans
both
lima
and
shell
corn
mushrooms
peas
pumpkin
sauerkraut
squash
succotash
and
other
vegetable
combinations
and
tomatoes
the
convenience
of
this
plan
will
be
readily
seen
when
it
is
understood
that
with
the
exception
of
the
special
vegetables
the
same
method
of
preparation
and
the
time
given
for
the
various
steps
in
the
canning
process
apply
to
all
vegetables
of
the
same
class
thus
if
directions
for
a
vegetable
belonging
to
a
certain
class
are
not
definitely
stated
in
the
text
it
may
be
taken
for
granted
that
this
vegetable
may
be
canned
in
the
manner
given
for
another
vegetable
of
the
same
class
general
the
canning
of
vegetables
may
be
most
successfully
done
by
the
method
tomatoes
however
because
of
the
large
quantity
of
acid
they
contain
may
be
canned
and
kept
with
little
difficulty
by
the
method
but
they
will
be
found
to
keep
their
shape
better
if
the
method
is
employed
the
time
required
for
cooking
any
vegetable
after
it
is
packed
in
jars
depends
on
the
kind
and
the
age
therefore
if
a
vegetable
is
hard
or
likely
to
be
tough
it
may
be
necessary
to
increase
the
time
given
in
the
directions
whereas
if
it
is
young
and
tender
or
very
ripe
as
in
the
case
of
tomatoes
the
time
for
cooking
may
perhaps
have
to
be
decreased
because
in
altitudes
higher
than
sea
level
the
boiling
point
of
water
is
lower
than
degrees
fahrenheit
the
length
of
time
for
boiling
foods
in
the
water
bath
must
be
increased
after
an
altitude
of
feet
is
reached
therefore
for
every
additional
feet
over
the
first
feet
per
cent
should
be
added
to
the
time
given
for
the
boiling
in
water
in
case
a
pressure
cooker
is
used
however
this
is
not
necessary
the
canning
directions
here
given
are
for
jars
if
pint
jars
are
to
be
used
decrease
the
salt
proportionately
also
decrease
the
time
for
cooking
in
each
case
of
the
time
or
per
cent
if
jars
are
to
be
used
double
the
amount
of
salt
and
add
to
the
length
of
time
for
cooking
or
per
cent
for
instance
if
a
jar
of

requires
minutes
a

tomatoes
proceed

the
length

required

depends
entirely
on
the
condition
of
the
tomatoes
they
should
be
blanched

results
from

with

such
a
combination
may
be
canned
safely
by
either

the
method
the
acid
of
the
tomatoes
helps
to
keep
the

the

requires
longer

directions
for
canning
fruits
the
chief
difference
between
the
canning
of
fruits
and
the
canning
of
vegetables
is
that
sugar
in
the
form
of
sirup
instead
of
salt
water
is
used
for
the
liquid
fruits
may
be
canned
without
sugar
if
desired
but
nothing
is
gained
by
so
doing
for
sugar
will
have
to
be
added
later
because
of
the
sugar
used
in
canning
and
the
acid
contained
in
the
fruit
canned
fruit
has
better
keeping
qualities
than
canned
vegetables
in
fact
it
is
much
more
likely
to
keep
well
even
though
it
does
not
receive
such
careful
attention
as
vegetables
it
is
for
this
reason
that
canned
fruit
does
not
require
so
much
time
for
sterilization
as
vegetables
do
still
it
should
not
be
inferred
that
care
is
not
necessary
in
the
canning
of
fruits
indeed
the
more
care
that
is
taken
the
better
are
the
results
likely
to
be
sirups
for
before
the
canning
of
fruits
can
be
undertaken
it
is
necessary
to
possess
a
knowledge
of
the
sirups
that
are
needed
such
sirups
consist
simply
of
sugar
dissolved
in
boiling
water
the
quantity
of
sugar
and
water
required
for
a
sirup
depends
on
the
acidity
of
the
fruit
and
the
purpose
for
which
it
is
to
be
used
plain
canned
fruits
that
are
to
be
used
for
sauces
etc
require
less
sugar
proportionately
than
those
which
are
preserved
and
fruit
canned
for
pie
making
may
have
less
than
either
thus
fruits
of
the
same
kind
may
be
canned
with
sirups
of
different
proportions
to
a
great
extent
the
quantity
of
sugar
to
use
with
fruit
may
be
regulated
by
the
taste
but
it
will
be
readily
seen
that
such
fruits
as
sour
cherries
and
plums
will
require
more
sugar
to
make
them
palatable
than
pears
and
blueberries
it
will
be
well
to
note
though
that
the
sugar
does
not
penetrate
the
fruit
unless
the
two
are
cooked
together
in
order
to
make
sirup
for
canning
place
the
desired
quantities
of
sugar
and
water
in
a
kettle
and
proceed
to
heat
them
stir
the
liquid
while
it
is
heating
in
order
to
assist
in
dissolving
the
sugar
when
it
has
begun
to
boil
rapidly
remove
the
sirup
from
the
fire
and
use
it
at
once
do
not
continue
boiling
in
preparing
such
sirups
it
will
be
well
to
note
that
the
greater
the
proportion
of
sugar
to
water
or
the
longer
the
sugar
and
water
are
allowed
to
boil
the
denser
or
heavier
will
the
sirup
become
it
is
this
of
sirup
that
regulates
its
use
for
the
different
kinds
of
fruit
and
determines
its
nature
thus
a
sirup
in
which
the
proportion
of
sugar
to
water
is
so
large
as
to
make
the
sirup
thick
is
known
as
a
one
in
which
the
proportion
of
water
to
sugar
is
so
large
as
to
make
the
sirup
thin
is
called
a
and
one
in
which
the
proportion
of
sugar
and
water
is
such
as
to
produce
a
sirup
that
is
neither
thick
nor
thin
but
stands
between
the
two
extremes

the
density
of
sirup
is
also
affected
by
the
amount
and
rapidity
of
evaporation
that
takes
place
in
boiling
and
these
in
turn
depend
on
the
amount
of
surface
that
is
exposed
for
instance
if
a
sirup
is
cooked
in
a
large
flat
kettle
the
evaporation
will
be
greater
and
more
rapid
than
if
it
is
cooked
in
a
small
deep
vessel
atmospheric
pressure
affects
the
rapidity
of
evaporation
too
in
a
high
altitude
evaporation
takes
place
more
slowly
than
at
sea
level
because
the
boiling
point
is
lower
thus
in
the
making
of
sirups
for
canning
the
first
point
to
be
determined
is
whether
the
sirup
desired
should
be
light
medium
or
heavy
and
in
its
preparation
the
points
mentioned
must
receive
consideration
for
determining
the
density
of
sirup
a
or
will
be
found
useful
this
device
consists
of
a
graduated
glass

attached
to
a

that
is
weighted

the

it
may

readily
later
in
the
recipes
for
canning
fruits
classification
of
for
the
sake
of
convenience
in
canning
fruits
too
are
here
divided
into
groups
these
groups
three
in
number
together
with
the
fruits
included
in
each
are
which
are
subdivided
into
three
kinds
namely
sweet
sour
and
very
sour
the
soft
include
blackberries
blueberries
or
huckleberries
sweet
cherries
elderberries
ripe
gooseberries
mulberries
and
black
and
red
raspberries
the
soft
apricots
currants
grapes
peaches
and
strawberries
and
the
sour
soft
sour
cherries
cranberries
green
gooseberries
plums
and
rhubarb
which
include
apples
quinces
and
pears
which
include
ripe
figs

loquats
nectarines
persimmons
and
pineapples
the
advantage
of
this
classification
as
in
the
case
of
the
vegetable
classification
is
that
as
a
rule
all
fruits
belonging
to
a
group
or
a
subdivision
of
a
group
may
be
canned
in
the
same
way
and
with
sirup
of
practically
the
same
density
canning
methods
for
the
canning
of
fruits
may
be
done
by
the
several
methods
previously
discussed
but
the
and
methods
seem
to
meet
with
most
favor
on
account
of
the
sirup
used
in
canning
fruit
and
the
acid
in
the
fruit
the
method
is
usually
fairly
successful
whereas
in
the
canning
of
vegetables
with
the
exception
of
tomatoes
it
is
not
so
reliable
the
housewife
by
experiment
can
determine
which
method
will
suit
her
needs
best
but
by
no
means
should
methods
be
mixed
if
a
certain
method
is
decided
on
it
should
be
adhered
to
in
every
detail
and
carried
through
without
any
substitution
for
all
methods
as
has
been
mentioned
the
fruit
should
be
selected
when
it
is
fresh
and
in
good
condition
as
such
fruit
has
less
chance
to
spoil
than
fruit
that
is
overripe
or
has
decayed
spots
after
it
is
graded
for
size
and
condition
the
fruit
should
be
washed
stemmed
hulled
seeded
peeled
or
halved
quartered
or
sliced
depending
on
the
kind
then
the
work
may
be
proceeded
with
according
to
the
canning
method
that
is
to
be
followed
if
fruits
are
to
be
canned
by
the
method
certain
precautions
must
be
observed
in
order
to
insure
success
the
sterilization
of
the
product
can
not
be
perfect
in
this
method
no
matter
how
carefully
the
canning
is
done
and
this
means
that
the
sugar
and
the
fruit
acids
must
be
greatly
relied
on
to
assist
in
preservation
still
the
jars
jar
covers
jar
rubbers
and
any
utensils
used
for
filling
the
jars
must
be
sterilized
and
kept
in
boiling
water
until
the
fruit
is
ready
to
be
canned
another
thing
to
guard
against
is
the
discoloring
of
the
fruit
any
fruit
that
is
likely
to
become
discolored
after
it
is
prepared
for
canning
should
be
kept
in
salt
water
until
it
is
ready
to
be
cooked
a
solution
consisting
of
teaspoonful
of
salt
to
each
quart
of
water
will
answer
for
this
purpose
after
the
fruit
has
been
prepared
and
while
the
containers
etc
are
being
sterilized
it
is
necessary
to
prepare
the
sirup
that
is
to
be
used
for
the
sweet
fruits
of
group
no
or
sirup
should
be
made
for
the
sour
fruits
of
this
group
no
or
sirup
and
for
the
very
sour
fruits
no
or
sirup
the
hard
fruits
may
be
canned
by
this
method
with
no
or
sirup
while
the
special
fruits
require
no
or
sirup
if
the
fruit
is
to
be
canned
for
pie
it
will
be
advisable
to
use
thin
sirup
and
then
use
more
sweetening
when
pies
are
made
when
the
sirup
is
made
by
mixing
the
sugar
and
water
and
bringing
it
to
a
boil
the
prepared
fruit
should
be
dropped
into
it
and
cooked
the
fruit
should
be
cooked
in
the
sirup
until
it
may
be
easily
pierced
with
a
fork
or
until
it
is
soft
berries
have
to
be
cooked
only
a
few
minutes
while
the
hard
fruits
may
require
from
to
minutes
the
jars
should
be
placed
upright
in
a
pan
of
hot
water
while
the
boiling
fruit
from
the
kettle
is
poured
into
them
and
as
each
jar
is
filled
the
rubber
should
be
put
in
place
and
the
cover
adjusted
and
secured
it
is
important
to
close
one
jar
before
filling
another
because
the
longer
a
jar
remains
open
the
more
bacteria
will
be
permitted
to
enter
even
by
working
as
rapidly
as
possible
and
taking
the
greatest
precaution
a
certain
number
of
bacteria
are
bound
to
enter
in
this
method
of
canning
after
the
jars
are
filled
and
sealed
they
should
be
placed
upside
down
or
on
the
side
to
cool
and
test
for
leaks
if
the
method
is
employed
in
canning
fruit
it
is
possible
to
obtain
a
sterilized
product
that
is
dependent
for
preservation
on
neither
the
sirup
used
nor
the
acid
of
the
fruit
in
this
method
the
jars
jar
tops
covers
and
utensils
for
handling
the
fruit
do
not
have
to
be
sterilized
beforehand
they
may
simply
be
washed
clean
and
kept
hot
in
clean
water
until
they
are
needed
after
the
fruits
are
prepared
some
are
blanched
or
scalded
and
while
others
are
not
they
are
then
packed
into
jars
and
boiling
sirup
is
poured
over
them
then
the
rubbers
are
adjusted
the
covers
placed
on
but
not
made
tight
and
the
jars
are
placed
under
water
in
the
water
bath
or
on
the
racks
in
the
pressure
cooker
which
should
contain
a
small
amount
of
water
as
has
been
explained
after
cooking
the
required
length
of
time
the
jars
of

are
removed
from
the
cooking
utensil
sealed
and
allowed
to
cool
the
sirup
used
in
the
canning
method
may
be
heavier
in
each
case
than
that
mentioned
for
the
method
because
there
is
no
evaporation
as
is
the
case
where
fruits
are
boiled
in
the
sirup
before
they
are
placed
in
the
cans
but
less
will
be
required
if
the

that
the

prepare

then
stemming

they
may
be
pitted
or
seeded
or
they
may
be
left
whole
depending
on
personal
preference
cherries
that
are
not
pitted
will
keep
their
shape
and
have
a
good
appearance
but
they
are
not
so
convenient
for
eating
as
those
which
have
been
pitted
after
the
fruit
has
been
prepared
in
the
manner
just
explained
pack
it
closely
into
the
hot
clean
jars
using
a
spoon
for
this
purpose
and
turning
each
jar
as
the
fruit
is
poured
into
it
press
the
berries
or
the
cherries
down
carefully
so
that
quarts
of
them
will
fill
a
jar
then
proceed
to
make
the
sirup
as
these
fruits
are
the
sweetest
they
require
less
sugar
than
any
other
if
such
fruit
after
it
is
canned
is
to
be
used
for
pie
making
sirup
no
or
will
be
suitable
but
if
it
is
to
be
used

no

may
be

when
the

and

pour

sour
soft
of
the
sour
fruits
strawberries
grapes
and
currants
require
about
the
same
quantity
of
sugar
that
contained
in
sirup
no
or
usually
being
sufficient
otherwise
the
canning
process
including
the
length
of
time
for
processing
does
not
differ
materially
from
that
just
given
for
sweet
soft
fruits
in
the
case
of
strawberries
those
which
are
of
medium
size
and
rather
dark
in
color
are
best
for
canning
in
fact
very
large
strawberries
will
shrink
more
than
any
other
kind
the
berries
are
washed
in
the
same
way
as
other
berries
but
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
stand
in
water
for
any
length
of
time
because
this
will
tend
to
make
them
soft
and
mushy
strawberries
must
be
stemmed
after
they
are
washed
and
for
this
purpose
a
strawberry
huller
should
be
utilized
such
a
device
which
is
shown
in
fig
permits
the
stems
to
be
removed
without
crushing
the
berries
and
soiling
the
fingers
in
preparing
currants
for
canning
the
procedure
is
the
same
as
for
the
fruits
already
mentioned
and
the
same
thing
is
true
of
grapes
that
are
not
to
be
seeded
if
the
seeds
are
to
be
removed
however
the
procedure
up
to
getting
the
cans
of
fruit
ready
for
processing
is
different
as
is
here
pointed
out
after
washing
the
grapes
squeeze
the
pulp
from
the
skins
and
then
cook
it
in
a
kettle
for
a
sufficient
length
of
time
to
make
it
soft
remove
the
seeds
by
forcing
the
pulp
through
a
sieve
then
add
as
much
sugar
as
would
be
used
for
making
the
required
sirup
and
cook
until
the
sugar
is
dissolved
with
this
done
add
the
sweetened
seedless
pulp
to
the
grape
skins
and
fill
the
jars
with
this
mixture
then
continue
the
canning
process
as
for
the
other
fruits
of
this
group
the
procedure
in
canning
apricots
and
peaches
the
other
two
sour
soft
fruits
differs
slightly
from
that
required
for
strawberries
grapes
and
currants
so
that
the
skins
of
both
of
these
fruits
may
be
easily
removed
they
must
be
scalded
which
is
an
operation
that
corresponds
to
blanching
in
vegetable
canning
for
canning
purposes
only
firm
fresh
apricots
and
peaches
that
are
not
overripe
should
be
selected
also
in
the
case
of
peaches
care
should
be
taken
to
see
that
they
are
of
the
variety
as
such
peaches
may
be
split
easily
should
not
be
chosen
unless
the

is
to
be
canned

canning
meat
and
fish
both
fish
and
meat
including
that
from
fowl
and
game
may
be
canned
at
times
that
seem
convenient
and
then
used
when
an
emergency
arises
or
at
a
time
when
the
same
food
will
cost
more
to
prepare
fowl
game
and
fish
may
be
canned
to
special
advantage
during
the
season
when
each
is
plentiful
the
best
process
for
canning
such
foods
is
the
method
in
canning
meat
whether
from
domestic
animals
fowl
or
game
first
cut
it
into
pieces
of
a
size
that
would
be
suitable
for
serving
at
the
table
the
meat
may
be
left
raw
or
it
may
be
prepared
by
any
desirable
cooking
process
such
as
frying
fricasseeing
braizing
etc
careful
attention
must
be
given
to
the
drawing
of
fowl
that
is
to
be
canned
because
the
entire
alimentary
tract
should
be
removed
without
being
broken
the
giblets
should
not
be
canned
with
the
rest
of
the
meat
as
they
will
not
keep
so
well
whether
the
meat
is
to
be
canned
raw
or
cooked
pack
the
jars
as
tightly
as
possible
if
the
meat
is
raw
add
teaspoonful
of
salt
to
each
quart
of
food
and
fill
the
jars
full
with
boiling
water
in
case
the
jar
is
filled
to
the
top
fat
will
rise
and
injure
the
rubber
if
the
meat
is
cooked
add
any
liquid
that
may
have
resulted
from
the
cooking
as
well
as
boiling
water
provided
more
liquid
is
needed
then
as
in
canning
vegetables
and
fruit
adjust
the
rubbers
and
covers
and
proceed
with
the
processing
in
the
case
of
raw
meat
sterilize
for
hours
in

in
the
pressure
cooker
to
prepare
fish
for
canning
first
clean
it
by
scaling
it
and
removing
the
entrails
wrap
the
cleaned
fish
in
cheesecloth
and
steam
for
minutes
after
steaming
remove
the
bones
which
will
come
out
easily
and
cut
the
fish
into
pieces
pack
the
pieces
into
the
jars
and
to
each
quart
of
the
food
add
teaspoonful
of
salt
next
fill
each
jar
full
with
boiling
water
and
continue
with
the
canning
in
the
manner
directed
for
meat
storing
and
serving
canned
foods
after
jars
of
canned
food
have
been
cooled
and
tested
for
leaks
carefully
wiped
with
a
damp
cloth
and
then
wrapped
and
labeled
they
are
ready
to
be
placed
in
storage
such
food
should
be
stored
in
an
orderly
manner
on
shelves
that
may
be
covered
to
keep
off
dust
or
in
a
large
cupboard
provided
with
doors
that
may
be
closed
the
temperature
of
the
room
in
which
the
canned
foods
are
kept
is
of
no
great
importance
but
in
homes
provided
with
cellars
the
cellar
is
the
logical
place
in
which
to
store
them
canned
foods
no
matter
how
well
the
canning
may
have
been
done
undergo
gradual
deterioration
therefore
those
kept
for
more
than
a
year
will
not
be
so
good
as
those
used
during
the
first
year
after
canning
if
canned
foods
from
a
previous
year
are
at
hand
when
new
cans
are
ready
to
be
stored
the
old
ones
should
be
placed
to
the
front
of
the
shelves
and
the
new
ones
to
the
back
so
that
the
old
ones
will
be
used
up
first
canned
foods
take
the
place
of
raw
foods
and
whether
they
should
be
cooked
or
not
depends
on
the
kind
in
the
case
of
vegetables
most
of
them
may
be
made
ready
to
serve
simply
by
heating
them
although
they
may
be
used
in
the
preparation
of
many
dishes
as
is
evident
from
the
recipes
throughout
the
lessons
in
the
case
of
fruits
some
may
be
served
just
as
they
come
from
the
can
however
there
are
many
ways
of
using
canned
fruits
in
the
making
of
desserts
as
is
pointed
out
in
and
fruit
in
the
case
of
meats
and
fish
the
food
if
cooked
before
canning
may
be
prepared
for
serving
simply
by
heating
it
whereas
if
it
is
canned
raw
some
cookery
method
for
meat
will
have
to
be
applied
when
foods
are
boiled
one
reason
for
a
change
in
taste
is
that
oxygen
is
driven
off
by
the
boiling
therefore
to
improve
the
taste
of
canned
foods
that
are
to
be
served
without
any
further
preparation
it
is
advisable
when
a
jar
is
opened
to
pour
the
contents
into
an
open
dish
and
thus
expose
it
to
the
air
in
opening
jars
of
canned
fruit
care
must
be
taken
not
to
crack
or
nick
either
the
top
of
the
jar
or
its
cover
the
cover
of
any
kind
of
jar
will
come
off
easily
if
a
little
air
is
admitted
insert
a
knife
blade
between
the
cover
and
jar
rubber
of
a
jar
but
do
not
use
a
knife
to
loosen
a
metal
top
as
it
may
bend
the
edge
in
places
hot
water
poured
over
the
jar
will
assist
in
opening
it
scoring
canned
foods
in
order
that
the
housewife
may
judge
the
quality
of
her
own
canned
products
according
to
standards
that
have
been
set
by
canning
authorities
a
score
card
together
with
an
explanation
of
the
terms
and
the
procedure
is
here
given
the
beginner
in
canning
will
do
well
to
score
her
own
foods
so
that
any
fault
that
may
be
found
can
be
corrected
when
similar
foods
are
canned
at
another
time
in
fact
the
chief
purpose
of
scoring
any
product
is
to
learn
of
faults
that
may
be
corrected
the
scoring
should
be
done
as
impartially
as
if
a
disinterested
person
were
doing
it
and
if
the
cause
of

as

drying
principles
of
drying
drying
consists
in
removing
the
moisture
contained
in
foods
by
evaporation
and
thus
rendering
them
less
susceptible
to
the
attacks
of
undesirable
bacteria
as
foods
so
treated
are
called
will
not
replace
fresh
or
canned
foods
however
they
are
valuable
in
many
cases
and
possess
some
advantages
over
such
foods
for
example
the
weight
of
dried
foods
is
very
greatly
reduced
the
storage
space
required
by
them
is
much
less
and
they
are
easy
to
keep
without
spoiling
and
easy
to
transport
likewise
the
containers
for
such
foods
are
less
costly
than
those
required
for
canned
foods
and
they
are
easily
procured
since
paper
boxes
or
paper
bags
are
satisfactory
in
fact
the
housewife
by
taking
care
of
the
bags
and
boxes
that
come
into
the
home
can
easily
provide
all
the
containers
she
will
possibly
need
at
practically
no
cost
the
water
in
food
that
is
to
be
dried
may
be
evaporated
by
applying
heat
by
bringing
the
food
in
contact
with
moving
air
or
by
subjecting
it
to
a
combination
of
both
of
these
methods
the
heat
for
drying
may
be
obtained
from
the
sun
as
in
the
or
from
the
stove
as
in
the
while
moving
air
for
evaporating
moisture
may
be
obtained
from
an
electric
fan
as
in
the
drying
in
the
application
of
any
of
these
drying
methods
however
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
more
surface
of
food
there
is
exposed
the
more
quickly
will
evaporation
take
place
drying
should
therefore
be
done
on
devices
constructed
in
such
a
way
that
air
may
pass
up
through
food
as
well
as
across
its
surface
in
drying
foods
the
racks
should
be
turned
frequently
so
that
all
parts
will
be
exposed
equally
to
the
heat
or
the
currents
of
air
also
the
food
must
be
turned
over
often
in
order
that
all
parts
will
dry
evenly
any
fruit
or
vegetable
may
be
dried
if
the
method
is
properly
applied
but
there
is
usually
more
or
less
change
in
both
the
flavor
and
the
color
of
the
dried
food
the
more
rapidly
the
drying
can
be
done
the
more
natural
will
the
color
and
flavor
remain
whereas
the
longer
the
process
is
continued
the
greater
will
be
this
change
foods
should
be
dried
when
they
are
in
such
quantity
that
they
can
not
be
used
to
advantage
in
the
raw
state
when
there
is
no
market
for
them
when
the
owner
can
not
afford
to
give
them
away
and
when
home
canning
ceases
to
be
practical
and
profitable
in
other
words
if
it
is
not
practical
to
save
foods
in
another
way
they
should
be
dried
drying
methods
devices
for
many
manufactured
devices
may
be
had
for
the
drying
of
foods
some
are
made
so
that
they
may
be
placed
on
top
of
a
stove
like
that
shown
in
fig
this
device
is
in
the
form
of
a
metal
box
it
has
a
tray
for
holding
the
food
to
be
dried
and
underneath
this
is
a
space
for
holding
water
water
is
poured
into
this
space
through
a
funnel
in
one
corner
and
heat
for
drying
is
supplied
by
heating
the
water
other
devices
are
made
so
that
they
may
be
suspended
over
a
stove
put
into
a
stove
oven
or
used
out
of
doors
still
others
have
a
heating
device
placed
inside
of
them
it
is
possible
however
to
make
drying
devices
in
the
home
that
will
answer
the
purpose
just
as
well
as
the
devices
that
may
be
bought
illustration
fig
as
has
been
stated
drying
devices
should
be
so
made
that
the
air
may
pass
up
through
the
food
and
across
its
surface
a
pan
a
platter
or
a
solid
board
as
will
be
readily
seen
is
not
so
good
for
drying
as
a
wooden
frame
of
convenient
size
that
has
small
slats
or
fine
netting
or
screening
attached
to
the
bottom
such
a

be
used
in
the
oven
or
set
in

driven
part
way
into

corner
will
provide
feet

thus
keep
it
from
resting
on
the
oven
floor
or
any
other
flat
surface
for
suspending
food
that
is
to
be
dried
over
a
stove
a
rack
like
that
shown
in
fig
may
be
easily
made
in
the
home
as
will
be
observed
it
consists
of
three
trays
fastened
together
these
trays
are
suspended
by
four
strings
tied
to
another
string
that
runs
over
small
pulleys
the
pulleys
are
attached
to
a
wooden
brace
that
is
secured
to
the
kitchen
wall
the
pulleys
and
string
permit
the
rack
to
be
raised
or
lowered
so
that
the
food
may
be
easily
put
into
and
taken
out
of

so
that
no

food
that
is
being
dried
outdoors
should
be
brought
into
the
house
when
the
sun
goes
down
and
put
out
again
the
following
morning
this
procedure
should
be
kept
up
until
the
food
is
so
dry
as
to
be
that
is
in
a
condition
that
will
permit
of
bending
without
cracking
if
food
is

the
method
it
may
be
placed
in
the
oven
on

of
the
stove
or
suspended
above
the
stove
if
the
oven
is
to
be
used
a
device
that
fits
the
oven
should
be
employed
spread
the
food
on
the
trays
in
single
layers
and
put
the
device
into
the
oven
the
temperature
of
the
oven
demands
attention
in
this
method
only
a
very
moderate
heat
may
be
applied
at
first
degrees
fahrenheit
being
considered
the
ideal
temperature
for
beginning
as
it
is
difficult
to
hold
an
oven
at
such
a
low
temperature
if
a
fire
is
burning
the
oven
door
should
be
left
open
to
admit
air
the
temperature
of
the
oven
of
a
coal
stove
in
which
the
fire
is
banked
or
is
being
allowed
to
go
out
is
usually
ideal
for
drying
foods
if
desired
the
heat
of
an
oven
may
be
gradually
increased
to
about
degrees
as
the
food
dries
but
the
application
of
greater
heat
is
liable
to
scorch
the
food
and
injure
its
flavor
the
food
must
be
turned
often
to
permit
it
to
dry
evenly
if
food
is
to
be
dried
on
top
of
the
stove
the
device
shown
in
fig
will
prove
satisfactory
the
same
arrangement
may
be
improvised
by
placing
a
metal
tray
over
a
large
flat
vessel
of
water
place
the
food
to
be
dried
in
a
single
layer
on
the
tray
over
the
water
let
the
water
boil
and
keep
it
boiling
and
turn
the
food
frequently
so
that
the
heat
will
be
applied
to
all
sides
continue
this
process
until
the
food
is
leathery
when
it
may
be
stored
if
food
is
to
be
dried
in
a
rack
suspended
above
the
stove
a
rack
like
that
shown
in

should
be
used
cover
the
trays
in
the
rack
with
a
single
layer
of
food
and
dry
it
to
the
leathery
stage
when
it
may
be
removed
and
stored
in
using
this
device
only
a
coal
or
a
wood
stove
is
practical
when
the
heat
coming
from
the
stove
is
not
great
the
rack
may
be
allowed
to
come
close
to
it
and
when
the
heat
is
intense
the
rack
may
be
drawn
up
regulating
the
distance
of
the
rack
from
the
stove
will
tend
to
keep
the
food
at
a
uniform
temperature
and
allow
it
to
dry
evenly
especially
when
the
food
is
turned
from
time
to
time
drying
if
a
house
is
wired
for
electricity
drying
foods
by
means
of
the
generated
by
a
moving
electric
fan
is
a
simple
matter
use
devices
like
those
required
for
the
sun
and
methods
spread
the
foods
to
be
dried
on
the
trays
in
a
single
thin

arrange
them
so
that

they
still
contain
a

small
quantity
of

this
moisture
however
is
not

evenly
because
some
of

pieces
of

are
larger
than

or
some
have
been

more
than

to

to
offset
this
unequal

the

should
not
be
closed
permanently
as
soon
as
the
food
is
put
into
them
rather
once
a
day
for
about
days
the

should
be
poured
from

several
times

the
object
in

is
to
keep

as
dry

that
is
not
to
allow

to
absorb

the
best

are
those
coated

may

if
this
is
not
possible
a

or
a

located
in
a
place
that
is
not

will
answer
it
is
well
in
storing
dried
foods
to
use
containers
that
will
hold
only
a
small
quantity
of
food
so
that
when
some
is
taken
out
to
be
cooked
a
large
amount
will
not
be
exposed
it
is
best
to
store
just
enough
for
a

or
two
in
each
container
before
dried

are
cooked
as
much
as
possible
of
the
water
evaporated
in
drying
should
be
restored
in
order
to
do
this
soaking
is
necessary
the

should
be
put
into
cold

water
made
in
the
proportion
of
teaspoonful
of
salt
to
quart
of

and
soaked
for

the
salt
water
seems
to
help
restore
the
original
color
of
the

they
should
be
cooked
in
the

in

jelly

value
of
jellies

and

like
canning
and
drying
jelly
making
preserving
and
pickling
are
methods
of
preparing
perishable
foods
to
resist
decomposition
and
change
when
treated
by
any
of
these
three
processes
fruits
and
vegetables
will
keep
for
long
periods
of
time
and
will
thus
be
ready
for
use
during
the
seasons
when
they
can
not
be
obtained
fresh
the
preservation
of
food
by
making
it
into
jellies
preserves
and
pickles
does
not
as
in
the
case
of
canning
depend
on
the
sterilization
of
the
product
but
rather
on
the
use
of
certain
ingredients
that
act
as
preservatives
these
include
sugar
spices
salt
and
vinegar
all
of
which
are
considered
harmless
preservatives
in
both
the
home
and
the
commercial
preparation
of
foods
the
making
of
jelly
preserves
and
pickles
may
seem
like
an
extravagance
in
the
expenditure
of
money
for
materials
as
well
as
of
time
and
energy
on
the
part
of
the
housewife
whether
this
is
the
case
or
not
is
a
matter
that
must
be
decided
by
the
housewife
herself
if
these
foods
are
not
of
enough
value
to
her
in
the
preparation
of
meals
and
the
feeding
of
her
family
to
make
it
worth
her
while
to
use
her
time
and
materials
in
storing
them
for
winter
use
then
it
is
not
wise
for
her
to
prepare
them
but
foods
so
preserved
usually
have
sufficient
merit
to
warrant
the
expenditure
of
the
time
and
the
money
required
in
their
making
in
the
first
place
it
will
often
be
necessary
to
throw
away
material
that
would
make
excellent
jelly
or
jam
unless
the
sugar
can
be
supplied
and
the
time
given
to
make
this
material
into
something
that
is
edible
and
at
the
same
time
attractive
as
is
well
known
all
through
the
canning
season
there
is
some
material
which
may
have
been
intended
for
canning
but
which
for
some
reason
can
not
be
used
in
that
way
such
material
should
be
utilized
in
the
preparation
of
these
foods
for
instance
some
of
the
berries
and
other
fruits
bought
for
canning
may
be
found
to
be
too
ripe
to
make
a
product
but
may
be
very
satisfactory
for
the
making
of
jars
or
jellies
then
too
if
the
method
of
canning
is
used
there
is
almost
certain
to
be
a
superfluous
amount
of
juice
that
would
be
wasted
if
it
were
not
used
in
the
making
of
jelly
such
material
need
not
necessarily
be
used
at
the
time
for
it
may
be
canned
and
then
made
up
later
at
some
more
convenient
time
in
addition
to
material
of
this
kind
there
is
often
a
surplus
of
vegetables
and
fruits
on
hand
particularly
if
one
has
access
to
a
garden
much
of
this
can
be
canned
and
dried
but
what
is
not
desired
for
these
purposes
might
be
wasted
if
it
were
not
made
up
into
appetizing
jellies
preserves
and
pickles
even
though
it
were
not
necessary
to
consider
the
matter
of
waste
and
the
utilizing
of
surplus
fruits
and
vegetables
there
would
still
be
sufficient
reason
for
the
making
of
jellies
preserves
and
pickles
because
these
foods
when
properly
prepared
have
great
value
in
the
meal
jellies
and
preserves
because
of
the
large
quantity
of
sugar
used
in
them
are
foods
high
in
carbohydrate
in
view
of
this
fact
they
should
be
considered
as
a
part
of
the
meal
in
which
they
are
served
instead
of
being
used
extravagantly
or
regarded
as
something
extra
in
an
already
sufficiently
large
menu
besides
their
importance
in
food
value
they
should
have
a
place
in
the
diet
because
they
stimulate
the
appetite
through
their
attractive
colors
and
delicious
flavors
the
familiar
fact
that
a
child
will
refuse
to
eat
plain
bread
and
butter
but
will
accept
the
same
piece
when
it
has
been
made
attractive
by
the
addition
of
a
little
jam
argues
much
for
the
use
of
foods
of
this
sort
in
children
diet
as
it
is
with
children
so
it
is
to
a
large
extent
with
adults
during
the
winter
months
when
fruits
and
fresh
vegetables
are
scarce
and
expensive
practically
every
one
finds
jellies
and
preserves
appetizing
for
these
things
in
a
measure
take
the
place
of
the
foods
that
are
difficult
to
procure
not
so
much
can
be
said
of
the
various
kinds
of
pickles
as
they
are
not
so
valuable
in
the
diet
from
the
standpoint
of
food
values
they
are
made
from
fruits
and
vegetables
as
are
jellies
and
preserves
but
the
preservatives
used
in
their
preparation
are
vinegar
and
spices
in
addition
to
having
no
food
value
such
ingredients
produce
overstimulation
and
irritation
in
the
alimentary
tract
toughen
the
cellulose
in
the
foods
used
and
consequently
often
cause
indigestion
and
various
gastric
disturbances
for
these
reasons
pickles
should
not
be
included
in
the
diet
of
children
however
because
of
the
stimulation
they
produce
in
the
stomach
foods
of
this
kind
if
taken
in
small
quantities
are
properly
served
as
appetizers
and
can
be
eaten
by
normal
adults
without
fear
of
digestive
disturbances
then
too
as
every
one
who
has
meals
to
prepare
knows
they
are
valuable
for
relieving
monotony
in
the
diet
a
point
that
should
not
be
overlooked
because
the
preservation
of
food
in
jellies
preserves
and
pickles
is
accomplished
by
the
use
of
certain
preservatives
instead
of
by
the
sterilization
of
the
food
as
in
canning
these
preparations
do
not
mold
or
spoil
readily
therefore
containers
of
a
different
nature
from
those
used
in
canning
may
be
used
to
store
these
foods
jars
having
tightly
sealed
covers
are
not
required
but
such
containers
as
bottles
stone
jars
or
crocks
glasses
etc
may
be
utilized
for
this
purpose
in
fact
containers
of
almost
any
description
may
be
used
for
jellies
preserves
and
pickles
they
should
of
course
be
sealed
in
some
way
to
prevent
the
entrance
of
bacteria
and
various
methods
of
accomplishing
this
have
been
devised
a
very
satisfactory
way
consists
in
pouring
melted
paraffin
over
the
top
of
the
food
and
then
covering
the
container
with
a
piece
of
heavy
paper
and
tying
this
on
securely
with
cord
since
jellies
preserves
and
pickles
occupy
a
place
of
importance
in
the
diet
and
at
the
same
time
provide
an
opportunity
to
utilize
material
that
might
otherwise
be
wasted
they
are
entitled
to
a
certain
amount
of
attention
from
the
housewife
to
equip
her
with
the
knowledge
she
needs
for
this
work
and
give
her
practice
in
jelly
making
preserving
and
pickling
the
details
of
these
processes
are
taken
up
step
by
step
in
this
section
jelly
making
principles
of
jelly
making
jelly
making
consists
in
cooking
fruit
juice
with
sugar
until
upon
cooling
it
will
solidify
or
jell
while
this
is
not
a
difficult
nor
a
complicated
process
there
are
some
housewives
who
do
not
have
success
with
it
often
the
result
may
be
very
good
when
a
certain
fruit
is
used
whereas
it
may
be
entirely
unsatisfactory
at
another
time
even
though
the
same
fruit
is
used
and
practically
the
same
procedure
is
followed
if
the
best
results
are
to
be
assured
in
jelly
making
the
principles
that
are
involved
in
this
process
must
first
be
thoroughly
understood
and
then
the
correct
procedure
must
be
painstakingly
followed
out
to
solidify
properly
and
thus
become
a
desirable
jelly
the
fruit
juice
that
is
used
for
this
purpose
must
have
the
following
characteristics
and
treatment
it
must
contain
certain
properties
it
must
be
extracted
properly
it
must
be
combined
with
the
correct
proportion
of
sugar
and
it
must
be
cooked
the
proper
length
of
time
there
are
of
course
numerous
degrees
of
solidity
of
jelly
varying
from
that
which
will
barely
retain
its
shape
to
that
which
is
very
tough
and
hard
but
neither
extreme
is
desirable
to
be
right
the
jelly
should
be
firm
enough
to
stand
up
well
but
should
be
tender
and
soft

fruit
is
the
principal
ingredient
in
the
making
of
jelly
as
it
is
the
source
from
which
the
juice
is
obtained
such
imperfections
in
fruits
as
poor
shape
or
unattractive
appearance
do
not
count
in
this
matter
since
only
the
juice
is
used
but
they
must
contain
properties
in
order
that
jelly
can
be
made
from
them
green
or
slightly
unripe
fruits
are
better
for
jelly
making
than
fruits
that
have
become
ripe
in
fact
when
in
this
immature
state
fruits
may
be
used
to
make
jelly
whereas
the
same
fruits
when
perfectly
ripe
often
will
not
make
jelly
at
all
or
if
they
do
will
produce
a
jelly
that
is
inferior
in
quality
the
chief
requirement
of
fruits
that
are
to
be
used
for
jelly
making
is
that
they
contain
acid
and
pectin
is
the
real
property
of
fruits
when
it
is
in
the
presence
of
acid
and
combined
with
the
correct
proportion
of
sugar
and
the
combination
is
properly
boiled
a
desirable
jelly
is
the
result
without
pectin
however
it
is
impossible
to
make
the
juice
solidify
or
jell
pectin
is
closely
related
to
the
carbohydrates
but
as
it
does
not
yield
heat
energy
nor
build
tissue
its
food
value
is
not
considered
in
this
respect
it
is
like
the
cellulose
of
fruits
and
vegetables
it
is
because
green
fruits
contain
more
pectin
than
do
ripe
fruits
that
they
are
more
suitable
for
jelly
making
the
lack
of
either
acid
or
pectin
need
not
however
prevent
the
making
of
jelly
from
fruits
such
as
sweet
fruits
that
contain
other
properties
for
either
or
both
may
be
supplied
from
some
other
source

in
the
making
of

as
in
the
preparation
of
many
other
foods
numerous
utensils
will
be
found
convenient
and
may
if
desired
be
supplied
to
make
the
work
easier
however
the
necessary
ones
are
comparatively
few
in
number
and
for
the
most
part
are
found
in
almost
every
kitchen
in
fig
are
shown
assembled
practically
all
the
equipment
used
in
the
making
of
jelly
and
if
a
housewife
is
provided
with
these
things
or
substitutes
for
them
she
will
be
well
equipped
for
her
work
as
will
be
observed
two
kettles
are
required
in
jelly
making
the
larger
one
is
used
for
cooking
the
fruit
and
the
smaller
one
to
cook
the
juice
and
the
sugar
these
should
have
a
perfectly
smooth
surface
and
may
be
made
of
almost
any
material
used
for
such
utensils
except
tin
or
iron
these
two
metals
are
undesirable
as
they
are
liable
to
lend
to
the
jelly
a
disagreeable
flavor
and
in
all
probability
an
unattractive
color
the
one
used
to
cook
the
fruit
should
generally
be
a
little
larger
than
the
other
as
about
glassfuls
of
jelly
may
be
cooked
at
one
time
the
kettle
in
which
the
juice
is
boiled
should
be
of
adequate
size
to
cook
this
amount
without
danger
of
its
boiling
over
when
fruit
juice
and
sugar
are
boiled
together
the
mixture
often
boils
up
and
runs
over
if
the
vessel
is
not
large
enough
jelly
the
jelly
bag
which
is
used
for
straining
the
boiled
fruit
and
thus
obtaining
the
juice
may
be
a
one
or
as
shown
in
the
illustration
one
that
is
purchased
for
the
purpose
if
the
bag
is
made
at
home
a
heavy
closely
woven
material
such
as
flannel
should
be
selected
so
as
to
prevent
the
tiny
particles
of
fruit
from
passing
through
with
the
juice
a
liquid
strained
in
this
manner
will
be
much
clearer
and
will
make
better
looking
jelly
than
that
which
has
been
run
through
a
coarse
material
such
as
cheesecloth
the
juice
can
be
strained
very
conveniently
if
the
bag
is
attached
to
a
wire
arrangement
like
the
one
shown
or
to
an
upright
standard
that
can
be
fastened
to
a
chair
or
a
table
for
then
the
bag
is
held
securely
over
the
vessel
into
which
the
juice
drips
sometimes
especially
when
more
than
one
extraction
of
the
juice
is
to
be
made
the
first
extraction
is
made
by
means
of
a
strainer
or
a
colander
and
the
juice
thus
obtained
is
then
strained
through
the
bag
additional
as
accurate
measurements
are
absolutely
essential
in
jelly
making
a
measuring
cup
should
be
included
in
the
equipment
then
too
a
quart
measure
will
be
found
very
convenient
especially
if
large
quantities
of
materials
are
to
be
cooked
at
one
time
a
large
spoon
or
two
for
stirring
skimming
and
testing
should
also
be
provided
the
spoon
used
for
skimming
will
produce
better
results
if
the
bowl
contains
holes
that
will
permit
the
juice
to
drop
back
into
the
vessel
for
then
none
of
the
juice
will
be
wasted

for
various
types
of
receptacles
in
which
to
keep
jelly
are
in
use
some
turning
out
more
attractive
molds
than
others
the
shape
of
the
mold
however
is
a
matter
of
minor
importance
almost
any
glass
receptacle
with
comparatively
smooth
sides
will
do
very
well
since
the
sealing
of
jelly
is
not
a
difficult
thing
to
do
therefore
new
receptacles
should
not
be
purchased
if
there
is
a
supply
of
any
suitable
kind
on
hand
for
many
other
containers
besides
purchased
jelly
glasses
may
be
used
for
this
purpose
the
most
convenient
type
which
may
be
bought
in
any
store
selling
kitchen
utensils
is
that
shown
in
fig
as
will
be
observed
these
are
somewhat
broad
and
not
very
tall
a
mold

jelly
turned
from
a
tall
narrow
glass
does
not
stand
up
so
well
as
that
turned
from
a
flat

too
a
tall

is
much
more

spill
than
a

the
most
convenient

they
are
not
an
absolute
necessity
in
their
place

be
used
paper

is
advisable
to
label
the
glasses
with
neat
labels

they
have
some
disadvantages
in
the
first
place
they
can
be
used
only
once
as
it
is
impossible
to
wash
them
in
addition
it
will
be

in
whatever
way
is
necessary
the
preparation
needed
will
depend
of
course
on
the
kind
of
fruit
selected
for
the
jelly
but
usually
not
so
much
preparation
is
needed
as
in
the
case
of
canning
for
instance
when
jelly
is
made
the
stems
are
removed
and
the
fruit
is
cut
into
halves

quarters
but
they
need
not

peeled
nor
have
the
seeds
taken
out
specific
directions
for
the
different
varieties
of
fruits
are
given
in
the
various
recipes
the
chief
precaution
to
take
in
preparing
the
fruit
no
matter
what
kind
is
used
is
to
see
that
it
is
thoroughly
cleaned
with
the
fruit
prepared
put
it
into
a
large
kettle
and
add
enough
water
to
start
the
cooking
and
prevent
scorching
some
fruits
will
require
more
water
than
others
especially
when
they
must
be
cooked
a
long
time
in
order
to
soften
them
sufficiently
to
extract
the
juice
juicy
fruits
like
plums
need
only
the
minimum
amount
of
water
while
drier
fruits
such
as
apples
require
more
place
the
kettle
on
the
stove
as
in
fig
and
allow
the
fruit
to
cook
until
it
is
soft
or
is
reduced
to
a
pulp
the
length
of
time
for
cooking
will
also
depend
entirely
on
the
kind
of
fruit
that
is
being
used
extracting
when
the
fruit
is
thoroughly
cooked
pour
the
pulp
and
the
juice
that
has
formed
into
the
jelly
bag
and
allow
it
to
drip
into
a
pan
placed
directly
under
the
bag
as
shown
in
fig
formerly
it
was
the
custom
to
let
the
juice
drip
until
no
more
remained
in
the
bag
this
method
is
followed
to
some
extent
at
present
but
it
is
falling
into
disuse
as
it
is
not
the
most
economical
way
of
extracting
the
juice
from
the
pulp
more
juice
can
be
obtained
and
more
jelly
made
from
the
same
amount
of
fruit
if
three
extractions
instead
of
one
are
made
make
the
first
extraction
by
pouring
the
pulp
and
juice
into
the
bag
and
permitting
the
juice
to
drip
only
until
it
begins
to
run
very
slowly
then
return
the
pulp
to
the
kettle
add
a
small
quantity
of
water
and
let
it
boil
again
for
a
few
minutes
pour
it
the
second
time
into
the
jelly
bag
and
let
it
drip
as
before
cook
it
the
third
time
in
the
same
way
and
then
allow
it
to
drip
until
all
the
juice
is
extracted
at
this
point
mix
the
juice
from
the
three
extractions
they
should
not
be
used
separately
for
they
are
much
different
in
quality

third
one
being
not
so
good
as
the
second

the
second

the
result

a
larger
quantity
of
juice
is
obtained
for
the
jelly
illustration
fig
the
quantity
of
juice
that
may

extracted
depends
on
the
quality
as
well
as
the
kind
of
fruit
if
the
season
is
a
rainy
one
the
fruits
will
be
found
to
contain
more
juice
than
they
would
in
a
dry
season
then
too
if
the
fruits
are
picked
immediately
after
a
rain
they
will
contain
more
juice
than
the
same
fruits
before
the
rain
the
amount
of
juice
the
fruit
contains
determines
of
course
the
quantity
of
water
that
should
be
added
in
the
cooking
if
only
one
extraction
is
intended
to
quarts
of
water
may
be
used
for
quarts
of
fruit
depending
on
the
kind
of
fruit
but
if
three
extractions
are
to
be
made
less
water
should
be
added
for
each
extraction
in
case
the
extracted
juice
contains
more
water
than
it
should
have
either
because
the
fruit
contains
an
excessive
amount
of
water
or
because
too
much
water
was
added
to
the
fruit
in
its
cooking
the
superfluous
water
will
be
extracted
by
boiling
the
juice
with
the
sugar
a
little
longer
as
the
jelly
is
being
made
it
is
not
always

often
the
skins
seeds
and
cores
of
fruits
may
be
cooked
with
water
and
the
juice
then
extracted
from
them
another
point
to
remember
is
that
the
pulp
from
which
the
juice
is
extracted
may
sometimes
be
used
for
jam
or
marmalade

points
like
these
are
taken
into
consideration

the

when
the

to
determine
whether
or
not
it
will

can
be
applied
by
the

be
known

to
give
the
exact
proportion
of
sugar
to

more
than
others
however
in

cupful
of

it
is
necessary
to
add
either
sugar
or
juice
the
additional
ingredient
should
be
carefully
measured
in
order
that
the
proportions
may
be
correct
for
the
making
of
jelly
it
must
not
be
understood
that
a
hydrometer
is
an
actual
necessity
in
the
making
of
jelly
for
very
good
jelly
can
be
made
without
measuring
the
ingredients
in
this
manner
however
if
a
hydrometer
is
not
used
it
will
be
necessary
to
apply
the
best
judgment
possible
to
the
rules
given
for
the
proportion
of
ingredients
used
in
jelly
making
combining
the
juice
and
the
mixing
of
the
juice
and
the
sugar
may
seem
like
a
trivial
matter
but
in
reality
much
is
involved
in
combining
these
ingredients
properly
it
may
be
done
in
three
different
ways
in
the
first
method
which
is
called
the
sugar
and
the
juice
are
mixed
cold
and
are
then
allowed
to
come
to
the
boiling
point
together
the
second
which
is
known
as
consists
in
putting
the
cold
juice
on
the
stove
allowing
it
to
boil
about
half
the
required
time
and
then
adding
the
sugar
which
has
also
been
heated
in
the
third
which
is
known
as
the
the
juice
is
boiled
without
the
sugar
almost
the
full
length
of
time
required
for
making
the
jelly
and
the
sugar
which
has
been
heated
is
added
just
before
the
boiling
is
completed
experience
in
the
use
of
these
three
methods
has
shown
their
advantages
and
disadvantages
the
first
one
or
the
process
has
the
disadvantage
of
losing
sugar
through
the
skimming
that
is
always
necessary
in
the
making
of
jelly
in
addition
the
long
boiling
often
causes
the
sugar
to
crystallize
and
thus
produces
a
jelly
that
would
not
score
very
high
the
short
boiling
is
not
entirely
satisfactory
because
of
the
difficulty
in
determining
just
when
to
add
the
sugar
to
the
juice
the
process
of
mean
boiling
having
neither
of
these
drawbacks
and
usually
resulting
in
jelly
of
excellent
quality
is
the
most
satisfactory
and
the
one
that
is
recommended
illustration
fig
to
carry
out
this
method
place
the
sugar
in
a
pan
in
a
warm
oven
or
other
place
where
it
will
gradually
become
heated
without
either
melting
or
scorching
put
the
juice
over
the
fire
in
a
saucepan
and
let
it
boil
for
to
minutes
then
as
shown
in
fig
slowly
add
the
correct
proportion
of
hot
sugar
to
the
boiling
juice
stirring
constantly
so
that
the
sugar
will
dissolve
as
quickly
as
possible
boiling
the
juice
and
the
boiling
of
the
juice
both
before
and
after
the
sugar
is
added
should
be
done
rapidly
during
this
process
it
will
be
found
that
a
scum
will
form
over
the
top
of
the
juice
this
should
be
skimmed
off
as
it
forms
for
it
is
a
detriment
to
the
jelly
as
shown
in
fig
draw
a
large
spoon
over
the
top
of
the
boiling
juice
from
time
to
time
and
skim
off
the
scum
that
rises
placing
it
into
any
small
dish
that
is
handy
it
is
usually
advisable
to
do
as
much
skimming
as
possible
before
the
sugar
is
added
so
that
only
a
minimum
amount
of
sugar
will
be
lost
the
length
of
time
required
to
boil
the
juice
after
the
sugar
is
added
depends
very
largely
on
the
way
in
which
the
boiling
is
carried
on
if
the
mixture
is
boiled
rapidly
less
time
will
of
course
be
needed
than
if
it
is
boiled
slowly
therefore
no
definite
time
can
be
set
for
the
cooking
however
several
tests
may
be
resorted
to
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
sugar
and
juice
have
boiled
long
enough
to
jell
when
the
mixture
is
cold
illustration

testing
the
jelly
the
testing
of
the
mixture
can
be
done
in
various
ways
the
one
to
select
depending
on
the
success
the
housewife
has
in
using
them
a
means
very
often
resorted
to
consists
in
dipping
a
spoonful
or
two
of
the
mixture
out
of
the
kettle
and
pouring
it
on
the
flat
surface
of
a
cold
dish
if
it
is
cooked
sufficiently
it
will
solidify
when
it
is
cold
and
will
appear
just
like
jelly
the
disadvantage
of
this
test
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
jelly
on
the
stove
continues
to
boil
while
the
test
is
being
made
and
as
this
takes
several
minutes
the
jelly
is
likely
to
overboil
to
a
considerable
extent
tests
that
can
be
performed
more
quickly
are
therefore
more
satisfactory
a
test
that
invariably
proves
successful
consists
in
dipping
up
a
spoonful
of
the
juice
and
allowing
it
to
run
slowly
from
the
spoon
back
into
the
pan
if
as
shown
in
fig
a
double
row
of
drops
forms
on
the
spoon
with
the
last
of
the
jelly
that
remains
it
may
be
known
that
the
cooking
is
finished
another
very
satisfactory
test
is
called
in
the
performing
of
this
test
a
spoonful
of
the
jelly
is
dipped
from
the
pan
and
then
poured
from
the
spoon
into
the
pan
again
if
it
is
cooked
to
the
proper
consistency
large
drops
will
form
at
the
edge
of
the
spoon
and
break
off
quickly

may
then
be
filled

this
can
be
done

water
and
allow
them

this
way
will
prevent
them
from

them
take

at
a
time
place
it
on

way

then
set
them
somewhere
out
of
a
draft

jelly
cools
it
seems
to
be
a
little

but
they
are

satisfactory

this
is
due
to
the
fact
that

grapes
contain
more
pectin

upon
being
cooked
produce
fewer
of
the
crystals
usually
found

is
being
done
the
housewife
often
feels
that
making
jelly
and
preserves
is
an
extravagant
use
of
sugar
still
fruit
juices
left
over
from
canning
and
large
quantities
of
fruit
such
as
crab
apples
and
currants
that
are
not
suitable
for
other
purposes
will
be
wasted
unless
they
are
used
for
jelly
if
it
is
not
convenient
to
use
the
fruit
at
the
time
it
is
obtained
a
good
plan
is
to
extract
the
juice
as
for
jelly
making
and
then
can
it
in
case
this
is
done
jelly
may
be
made
from
the
juice
during
the
seasons
of
the
year
when
less
sugar
is
required
for
other
things
to
can
fruit
juice
extract
it
from
the
fruit
as
for
jelly
making
and
then
bring
it
to
the
boiling
point
select
bottles
or
jars
that
may
be
tightly
closed
sterilize
them
fill
them
with
the
boiling
juice
and
seal
them
bottles
may
be
used
for
this
purpose
if
they
are
well
corked
and
then
dipped
into
melted
sealing
wax
or
paraffin
when
properly
sealed
fruit
juices
will
probably
keep
without
any
further
effort
to
preserve
them
but
to
make
positively
certain
that
they
will
not
spoil
it
is
a
wise
precaution
to
process
the
filled
bottles
or
jars
in
boiling
water
for
about
or
minutes
in
the
same
way
in
which
canned
fruit
is
processed
when
treated
in
this
way
fruit
juices
will
keep
perfectly
and
may
be
made
into
jelly
at
any
time
during
the
winter
preserving
principles
of
preserving
preserving
consists
in
preparing
fruits
in
perfect
condition
to
resist
decomposition
or
change
by
cooking
them
in
heavy
sirup
the
cooking
is
done
so
slightly
that
the
original
form
flavor
and
color
of
the
fruit
are
retained
as
far
as
possible
this
process
is
similar
to
that
of
canning
by
the
method
that
is
the
fruit
and
sugar
are
combined
and
cooked
to
the
proper
consistency
in
the
preserving
kettle
sugar
is
used
in
such
quantity
in
the
preparation
of
preserves
that
it
acts
as
a
preservative
and
prevents
bacteria
from
attacking
the
foods
in
which
it
is
used
if
preserves
of
any
kind
ferment
it
may
be
known
that
not
enough
sugar
was
used
in
their
preparation
the
sterilization
of
the
product
and
the
sealing
of
the
containers
which
are
necessary
in
the
canning
of
fruits
and
vegetables
need
not
be
resorted
to
in
the
case
of
preserves
selection
of
when
fruit
is
to
be
made
into
preserves
much
attention
should
be
paid
to
its
selection
for
as
a
rule
only
the
finest
fruits
are
used
for
preserving
this
is
especially
true
of
the
smaller
fruits
such
as
berries
and
cherries
for
they
are
preserved
whole
therefore
in
order
that
they
may
have
a
good
appearance
when
preserved
it
is
necessary
that
they
be
as
perfect
as
possible
to
begin
with
in
addition
the
fruit
should
be
thoroughly
ripe
but
not
mushy
nor
overripe
as
the
cooking
of
the
fruits
in
sirup
hardens
them
to
a
certain
extent
fruits
that
are
not
sufficiently
ripe
can
not
be
used
for
they
would
be
too
hard
when
done
if
care
is
used
in
selecting
fruits
that
are
to
be
preserved
a
product
will
be
the
result
since
this
process
is
carried
on
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
impair
their
shape
methods
of
several
methods
of
preserving
fruit
are
in
practice
but
in
general
the
same
principles
characterise
each
one
probably
the
most
successful
method
consists
in
bringing
a
certain
proportion
of
sugar
and
water
to
the
boiling
point
dropping
the
fruit
into
the
sirup
thus
formed
and
cooking
it
for
a
definite
length
of
time
boiling
fruits
in
heavy
sirup
has
a
tendency
to
make
them
firm
and
solid
rather
than
to
cook
them
to
pieces
as
would
be
the
case
with
water
or
a
thin
sirup
even
very
soft
berries
when
used
for
preserves
will
retain
almost
their
original
size
and
shape
if
they
are
properly
cooked
except
for
the
fact
that
a
heavier
sirup
is
used
the
process
of
preserving
fruit
is
exactly
like
that
of
canning
fruit
by
the
method
the
chief
precaution
to
take
in
this
method
is
that
as
little
water
as
possible
be
used
so
that
the
sirup
may
be
very
thick
when
the
fruit
is
added
another
method
that
may
be
recommended
because
it
helps
to
keep
the
fruit
in
good
condition
consists
in
cooking
it
in
its
own
juice
in
this
method
equal
quantities
of
fruit
and
sugar
are
put
together
and
allowed
to
stand
until
enough
juice
is
formed
preferably
overnight
so
that
the
fruit
may
be
cooked
without
the
addition
of
any
water
strawberries
are
excellent
when
preserved
in
this
way
whichever
method
is
followed
better
results
will
be
obtained
if
only
a
few
quarts
of
fruit
are
cooked
at
a
time
when
a
large
quantity
of
berries
for
instance
is
added
to
the
boiling
sirup
they
will
form
such
a
thick
layer
that
they
will
have
to
remain
over
the
fire
a
long
time
before
they
come
to
the
boiling
point
they
will
therefore
be
much
more
likely
to
crush
and
give
the
finished
product
a
mushy
appearance
than
if
a
smaller
quantity
which
will
form
a
thinner
layer
is
cooked
each
time
utensils
for
the
equipment
necessary
in
the
making
of
preserves
is
similar
to
that
used
for
making
jelly
with
the
exception
of
the
dripping
bag
and
the
hydrometer
a
preserving
kettle
is
of
course
required
for
the
cooking
of
the
fruit
and
sirup
a
measuring
cup
and
a
quart
measure
are
needed
for
the
measuring
of
the
ingredients
and
a
wooden
spoon
or
paddle
is
the
most
convenient
utensil
with
which
to
stir
all
foods
of
this
class
containers
similar
to
those
used
for
jelly
will
be
satisfactory
receptacles
in
which
to
put
preserves
but
as
preserved
fruits
are
not
turned
out
in
a
mold
almost
any
kind
of
bottle
or
jar
may
be
used
for
this
purpose
paraffin
should
also
be
provided
as
this
should
always
be
used
for
the
first
covering
to
prevent
the
formation
of
molds
which
are
likely
to
grow
on
moist
sweet
substances
exposed
to
the
air
before
using
paraffin
for
preserves
they
should
be
allowed
to
stand
until
the
surface
has
become
absolutely
dry
it
is
well
to
label
preserves
too
so
labels
should
be
kept
on
hand

this
purpose

will
follow

must
be
exercised

strawberry
strawberries
selected
for
preserves
should
be
of
the
dark
solid
variety
if
possible
since
these
shrink
less
and
retain
their
shape
and
size
better
than
do
the
lighter
varieties
this
fruit
is
made
into
preserves
probably
more
often
than
any
other
kind

conserves
conserves
do
not
differ
materially
from
preserves
in
their
preparation
but
they
usually
consist
of
a
mixture
of
two
or
more
fruits
whereas
preserves
are
made
from
a
single
fruit
all
rules
that
govern
the
making
of
preserves
apply
equally
well
to
the
making
of
conserves
there
are
certain
fruits
that
combine
very
well
as
far
as
flavor
color
etc
are
concerned
and
these
are
generally
used
together
in
the
preparation
of
this
food
however
almost
any
combination
of
fruits
may
be
made
into
conserves
this
is
therefore
a
very
good
way
in
which
to
utilize
small
quantities
of
fruits
then
too
a
cheap
material
may
be
combined
with
a
more
expensive
one
to
make
a
larger
quantity
of
a
moderately
priced
product
as
for
instance
rhubarb
and
pineapple
again
the
pulp
from
which
juice
has
been
extracted
for
jelly
may
be
used
to
make
conserve
in
fact
a
little
ingenuity
on
the
part
of
the
housewife
and
familiarity
with
general
preserving
methods
will
enable
her
to
make
many
kinds
of
excellent
conserves
even
though
she
may
not
have
a
definite
rule
or
recipe
to
cover
the
use

a
form
of

generally
used

a
form
of

similar
to

and
are
used
in
the
place
of

jams
conserves
or

the
fruit
used
for
this
purpose
which
may
be
either
large
or

is
usually
very
ripe

somewhat
soft
therefore
as
in
the
case
of

imperfect

that
are
not
suitable

can
be

very
well
for

butters
made

differ
from

in
that
both

are
always
removed
the

is
smooth

thick
having
been
made
thick

rather
than
by

quantities
of

in

less
sugar
is
used
for
butters
proportionately
than
for
any
other
preserved
fruit
spices
are
generally
used
in
butters
so
that
the
mixture
is
very
highly
flavored
to
prevent
butters
from
scorching
they
should
be
stirred
constantly
for
a
long
period
of

this

becomes
very
tiresome

it
should
not
be
stopped

pickling
principles
of
pickling
pickling
consists
in
preserving
fruits
and
vegetables
in
vinegar
or
brine
each
of
these
liquids
acts
as
a
preservative
so
that
the
receptacles
or
containers
for
the
food
do
not
have
to
be
sealed
nor
does
the
preserved
food
require
much
care
in
order
to
have
it
keep
perfectly
the
effect
of
the
pickling
liquids
on
both
fruits
and
vegetables
is
very
similar
the
salt
in
the
brine
or
the
vinegar
hardens
the
cellulose
of
the
foods
to
such
an
extent
that
they
are
impervious
to
the
action
of
bacteria
while
this
permits
the
foods
to
keep
well
it
also
makes
them
difficult
to
digest
a
fact
that
must
be
remembered
when
pickled
foods
are
included
in
the
diet
the
procedure
in
pickling
is
simple
after
the
fruit
or
vegetable
is
cleaned
and
prepared
in
the
way
desired
it
is
merely
a
matter
of
placing
the
food
in
sterilized
jars
or
crocks
pouring
the
hot
preserving
liquid
over
it
allowing
it
to
cool
and
then
storing
it
in
some
cases
the
food
is
cooked
and
in
others
it
is
not
as
a
rule
spices
of
some
kind
or
other
are
added
both
to
aid
in
preserving
and
to
impart
flavor
practically
all
large
fruits
and
many
vegetables
are
pickled
as
is
shown
in
the
recipes
that
follow
foods
preserved
by
pickling
are
known
as
either
or
while
both
products
are
similar
in
many
respects
relishes
are
distinguished
from
pickles
in
that
as
a
rule
they
are
made
up
from
more
than
one
kind
of
fruit
or
vegetable
and
usually
the
pieces
are
cut
or
chopped
and
not
put
up
whole
often
the
foods
in
relishes
are
chopped
or
cut
so
fine
as
to
make
it
almost
impossible
to
tell
what
the
fruit
or
vegetable
was
originally
the
food
value
of
both
these
products
is
not
extremely
high
unless
a
great
quantity
of
sugar
is
used
in
the
pickling
this
is
sometimes
the
case
with
pickled
peaches
or
pears
but
seldom
if
ever
with
pickled
vegetables

confections
nature
and

nature
of
confections
confections
are
such
sweetmeats
as
candy
and
similar
articles
which
have
for
their
foundation
sugar
sirup
honey
and
the
like
as
is
well
known
the
most
important
variety
of
confection
is
candy
and
this
is
the
one
that
is
usually
meant
when
the
term
confections
is
mentioned
confections
however
are
not
so
limited
as
might
be
imagined
upon
first
thought
for
many
delicious
dishes
whose
main
ingredient
is
nuts
fruits
coconut
or
pop
corn
are
also
placed
in
this
class
to
be
sure
most
of
these
contain
sweetening
material
of
some
sort
in
greater
or
smaller
quantities
therefore
in
its
broadest
sense
confections
may
be
regarded
as
preparations
having
for
their
chief
ingredient
sugar
or
substances
containing
it
such
as
molasses
honey
usually
mixed
with
other
food
materials
such
as
nuts
fruits
chocolate
starches
and
fats
to
give
them
body
and
consistency
and
flavored
and
colored
in
any
desired
way
the
making
of
confections
and
of
candy
in
particular
is
both
a
useful
and
a
delightful
pastime
that
can
be
indulged
in
even
by
those
who
are
only
slightly
skilled
in
fact
with
a
certain
amount
of
knowledge
of
the
methods
used
and
a
little
practice
surprising
results
can
be
obtained
by
the
amateur
candy
maker
then
too
it
is
a
comparatively
simple
matter
to
copy
the
confectioner
work
a
considerable
variety
of
candies
can
often
be
made
from
a
simple
foundation
material
if
a
little
originality
or
ingenuity
is
applied
since
it
is
an
easy
matter
to
prepare
foods
of
this
kind
and
since
they
can
be
made
at
home
more
cheaply
and
of
more
tasty
and
wholesome
materials
it
is
a
decided
advantage
to
make
them
rather
than
buy
them
particularly
if
they
are
used
extensively
in
the
home
however
not
so
much
fear
need
be
felt
now
as
formerly
with
regard
to
commercially
made
candies
for
much
has
been
done
in
recent
years
to
compel
the
use
of
wholesome
materials
in
candies
especially
the
cheaper
ones
that
children
are
apt
to
buy
the
laws
require
that
no
such
adulterants
as
are
not
food
materials
and
no
harmful
flavorings
colorings
nor
alcoholic
beverages
be
used
in
making
confections
as
can
well
be
understood
this
is
a
valuable
protection
consequently
at
the
present
time
the
harm
if
any
resulting
from
eating
candy
comes
from
either
the
excessive
or
the
wrong
use
of
it
the
taste
for
confections
of
all
kinds
is
one
that
is
acquired
and
it
is
often
developed
to
harmful
extremes
therefore
these
foods
like
most
others
should
be
indulged
in
only
in
moderation
they
will
then
prove
not
only
valuable
but
entirely
unharmful
the
greatest
precaution
that
should
be
observed
in
their
use
is
in
giving
them
to
children
very
young
children
should
not
have
candy
at
all
it
being
much
too
concentrated
for
digestive
organs
that
are
used
to
handling
only
diluted
food
materials
as
they
grow
older
and
their
diet
begins
to
include
more
foods
a
small
quantity
of
wholesome
sweets
will
not
be
harmful
if
it
is
given
at
meal
time
adults
with
normal
digestion
may
eat
a
reasonable
amount
of
candy
and
other
confections
without
injury
to
assist
in
the
making
of
confections
in
the
home
the
principles
of
candy
making
as
well
as
those
which
must
be
understood
for
the
making
of
such
other
foods
as
are
commonly
called
confections
are
given
in
this
section
in
addition
there
are
included
explicit
directions
for
the
making
of
simple
candies
and
confections
and
of
some
of
the
varieties
that
are
more
difficult
to
make
the
various
operations
are
not
hard
to
perform
and
good
results
may
be
expected
if
each
step
is
carried
out
as
directed
the
operations
requiring
skill
and
dexterity
such
as
the
coating
of
bonbons
and
chocolates
must
be
repeated
several
times
if
results
that
approach
those
of
the
professional
confectioner
are
to
be
attained
still
surprisingly
good
results
may
be
obtained
the
first
time
the
work
is
done
if
directions
are
followed
explicitly
composition
of
confections
carbohydrate
in
so
far
as
their
composition
is
concerned
confections
are
largely
carbohydrate
in
the
form
of
sugar
this
food
material
may
be
one
of
several
different
varieties
as
is
well
understood
the
high
percentage
of
carbohydrate
which
in
some
cases
may
be
very
close
to
per
greatly
increases
the
food
value
of
this
variety
of
foods
where
the
percentage
is
very
high
the
candies
are
necessarily
hard
for
all
or
nearly
all
the
moisture
is
driven
off
in
the
making
in
this
case
as
in
other
foods
the
more
water
there
is
present
the
more
reduced
is
the
total
food
value
fat
in
to
a
certain
extent
fat
is
found
in
these
foods
it
is
supplied
largely
by
the
use
of
milk
condensed
milk
cream
butter
or
butter
substitutes
nuts
and
chocolate
while
these
materials
are
usually
added
to
produce
a
certain
flavor
or
consistency
they
form
at
the
same
time
an
ingredient
that
greatly
increases
the
food
value
of
the
finished
product
protein
in
protein
is
not
found
extensively
in
confections
unless
nuts
chocolate
milk
or
other
foods
containing
it
are
used
in
their
preparation
but
even
then
sweets
are
usually
eaten
in
such
small
quantities
that
the
protein
in
them
does
not
figure
to
any
great
extent
so
that
at
best
confections
are
not
considered
as
a
source
of
protein
at
any
time
however
nuts
as
will
readily
be
seen
are
a
rather
food
mineral
salts
in
refined
sugar
does
not
contain
mineral
salts
so
that
unless
other
ingredients
containing
this
food
substance
are
added
no
mineral
salts
will
be
present
in
confections
it
is
true
that
some
of
the
ingredients
used
such
as
milk
fruits
nuts
molasses
honey
maple
sirup
contain
certain
minerals
but
just
as
confections
are
not
taken
as
a
source
of
protein
so
they
are
not
characterized
by
the
minerals
in
them
confection
making
ingredients
used
in
confections
foundation
materials
the
most
important
ingredient
used
in
the
making
of
confections
is
sugar
it
is
therefore
well
that
the
nature
of
this
ingredient
be
thoroughly
understood
its
chief
commercial
varieties
are
and
both
of
which
produce
the
same
results
in
cookery
operations
when
sugar
is
mentioned
as
an
ingredient
plain
granulated
sugar
is
meant
unless
it
is
otherwise
stated
whether
this
is
cane
or
beet
sugar
makes
no
difference
the
fineness
and
the
color
of
sugar
are
due
to
its
refinement
and
the
manufacturing
processes
through
which
it
is
put
and
these
are
indicated
by
various
terms
and
trade
names
such
as
and
sugars
the
grading
of
granulated
sugar
is
based
on
the
size
of
its
crystals
this
sugar
coming
in
three
qualities
the
coarsest
is
known
as
the
next
finer
as
and
the
finest
as
there
is
also
a
fourth
grade
known
as
or
and
often
called
or
so
far
as
candy
is
concerned
the
coarseness
of
the
sugar
does
not
make
a
great
deal
of
difference
although
the
finer
sugars
are
perhaps
a
little
better
because
they
dissolve
more
quickly
in
the
liquid
and
are
a
trifle
less
likely
to
crystallize
after
cooking
when
sugar
is
to
be
used
without
cooking
however
its
fineness
makes
a
decided
difference
sugars
finer
than
granulated
are
known
as
and
are
made
by
grinding
granulated
sugar
in
a
mill
that
crushes
the
crystals
these
pulverized
sugars
are
known
on
the
market
as
powdered
standard
and
the
last
being
the
one
that
should
always
be
purchased
for
the
making
of
confectionery
where
the
use
of
uncooked
sugar
is
required
one
of
the
chief
characteristics
of
sugars
of
this
kind
is
that
they
lump
to
a
great
extent
the
finer
the
sugar
the
larger
and
harder
being
the
lumps
before
sugar
that
has
become
lumpy
can
be
used
it
must
be
reduced
to
its
original
condition
by
crushing
the
lumps
with
a
rolling
pin
and
then
sifting
the
sugar
through
a
fine
wire
sieve
as
explained
in
cookies
and
part
sugars
of
this
kind
are
not
suitable
for
cooking
purposes
such
as
the
preparation
of
cooked
icings
etc
these
are
made
from
granulated
or
other
coarse
sugar
while
the
uncooked
ones
are
made
from
xxxx
or
as
it
is
sometimes
called
then
too
fine
sugars
cost
more
than
do
the
granulated
sugars
so
it
is
well
to
remember
that
nothing
is
gained
by
their
use
the
third
variety
of
sugars
which
are
known
as
are
purchased
by
the
retail
dealer
by
number
there
are
fifteen
grades
of
this
sugar
ranging
from
to
and
the
number
indicates
the
color
of
the
sugar
no
is
practically
white
while
no
is
very
dark
and
the
intervening
numbers
vary
in
color
between
these
two
shades
the
lightness
of
the
color
indicates
the
amount
of
refinement
the
sugars
have
had
the
sugars
are
stronger
in
flavor
and
indicate
less
refinement
than
the
light
ones
when
brown
sugar
is
required
for
any
purpose
it
is
usually
advisable
to
use
one
of
the
lighter
shades
because
they
are
more
agreeable
in
taste
than
the
very
dark
ones
the
liquid
that
remains
after
most
of
the
sugar
has
been
refined
out
of
the
cane
juice
is
known
as
molasses
the
juice
from
beets
does
not
produce
molasses
therefore
all
of
the
molasses
found
on
the
market
is
the
product
of
cane
juice
a
molasses
known
as
is
made
by
boiling
the
sap
of
sorghum
which
is
a
stout
cereal
grass
but
this
variety
is
seldom
found
on
the
general
market
it
being
used
locally
where
it
is
manufactured
the
dark
color
and
the
characteristic
flavor
of
molasses
are
due
to
the
foreign
materials
that
remain
in
the
juice
after
the
removal
of
the
sugar
molasses
is
not
so
sweet
as
sugar
but
it
is
much
used
as
an
ingredient
in
the
making
of
many
delicious
confections
as
in
the
case
of
soft
sugars
the
lighter
the
molasses
is
in
color
the
more
agreeable
is
the
flavor
of
the
confections
made
from
it
another
substance
much
used
in
the
making
of
confections
is
glucose
it
is
usually
manufactured
from
the
starch
of
corn
and
is
put
on
the
market
under
various
trade
names
but
generally
it
is
called
many
persons
have
long
considered
glucose
a
harmful
food
but
this
belief
has
been
proved
untrue
glucose
has
come
to
be
absolutely
necessary
in
some
candy
making
in
order
to
produce
certain
results
the
glucose
that
the
confectioners
use
is
a
heavier
stickier
substance
than
the
sirups
that
can
be
purchased
for
table
use
or
for
cooking
but
these
do
very
well
for
most
purposes
however
none
of
the
glucose
preparations
are
so
sweet
as
sugar
maple
sirup
or
honey
glucose
will
not
crystallize
nor
make
a
creamy
substance
neither
will
it
permit
any
substance
that
contains
more
than
a
very
little
of
it
to
become
creamy
a
creamy
candy
containing
a
small
amount
of
it
will
remain
soft
longer
than
that
made
without
it
also
it
will
cream
without
danger
of
the
formation
of
large
crystals
because
of
these
characteristics
which
are
responsible
for
its
use
in
candy
making
a
mixture
containing
glucose
will
not
go
to
sugar
confections
and
clear
candies
contain
a
large
proportion
of
glucose
while
any
that
are
intended
to
be
creamy
such
as
bonbons
and
the
centers
for
chocolates
have
only
a
small
amount
if
any
glucose
in
them
maple
sirup
and
maple
maple
sirup
and
maple
sugar
because
of
their
pleasing
flavor
are
used
extensively
for
candy
making
maple
sirup
is
of
course
the
basis
for
maple
sugar
for
by
boiling
the
sirup
to
evaporate
the
water
and
then
stirring
it
maple
sugar
results
when
the
sirup
is
used
for
candy
making
it
must
be
boiled
but
it
seldom
requires
any
liquid
other
than
that
which
it
already
contains
on
the
other
hand
maple
sugar
requires
liquid
in
some
form
for
it
must
first
be
dissolved
in
a
liquid
and
then
boiled
with
it
honey
that
has
been
pressed
from
the
comb
and
is
in
the
form
of
a
heavy
sirup
is
used
in
the
making
of
various
confections
it
provides
a
delightful
flavor
much
different
from
that
of
sugar
and
when
it
is
cooked
it
acts
in
much
the
same
way
as
glucose
flavorings
kinds
of
flavorings
are
very
important
in
the
making
of
confections
for
it
is
on
them
that
much
of
the
appetizing
effect
of
these
foods
depends
in
fact
unless
good
flavorings
are
secured
and
then
used
discreetly
tasty
results
can
not
be
expected
the
flavorings
used
in
candy
making
are
in
reality
divided
into
two
classes
and
natural
under
the
head
of
natural
flavorings
come
those
which
are
made
from
the
fruit
or
the
plant
that
produces
the
desired
flavor
they
are
known
as
and
the
oils
are
obtained
by
pressing
out
the
natural
flavoring
substance
from
the
material
containing
it
they
are
usually
very
strong
so
that
only
a
little
is
needed
to
flavor
a
comparatively
large
quantity
of
food
peppermint
wintergreen
and
cinnamon
are
the
oils
that
are
used
the
most
extracts
are
prepared
by
using
alcohol
to
extract
the
flavoring
substances
from
certain
materials
the
alcohol
acts
as
a
preservative
so
that
the
finished
extract
nearly
always
contains
a
high
percentage
of
this
material
vanilla
and
such
flavorings
as
lemon
and
orange
are
examples
of
extracts
that
are
usually
made
in
this
way
a
few
companies
manufacture
a
product
in
which
glycerine
instead
of
alcohol
is
used
as
the
preservative
flavorings
so
prepared
are
in
the
form
of
a
thick
sirupy
substance
rather
than
a
liquid
and
are
usually
sold
in
a
tube
artificial
flavorings
classified
as
artificial
flavorings
are
of
two
kinds
those
having
for
their
basis
substances
extracted
from
coal
tar
and
those
prepared
by
various
chemical
combinations
they
are
also
known
as
with
regard
to
both
healthfulness
and
taste
they
are
not
so
desirable
as
the
natural
flavorings
adulteration
of
as
it
is
a
common
practice
to
adulterate
flavorings
every
manufacturer
of
these
materials
is
obliged
to
state
on
the
label
of
each
bottle
or
tube
of
flavoring
just
what
its
contents
consist
of
therefore
when
the
purchase
is
made
the
label
should
be
carefully
examined
without
doubt
vanilla
is
adulterated
more
often
than
any
other
flavoring
a
pure
extract
of
vanilla
being
seldom
found
the
beans
from
which
the
flavor
is
extracted
are
very
expensive
so
the
tonka
bean
and
other
cheaper
flavoring
substances
are
often
resorted
to
in
the
making
of
this
flavoring
however
when
large
amounts
of
such
things
are
used
the
price
of
the
extract
should
be
less
than
that
charged
for
the
pure
extract
of
the
vanilla
bean
many
chefs
and
professional
cooks
overcome
this
difficulty
by
purchasing
the
vanilla
beans
and
using
them
for
flavoring
purposes
by
soaking
or
cooking
small
pieces
of
them
in
the
material
that
is
to
be
flavored
or
grinding
the
bean
in
a
mortar
and
using
it
in
the
ground
form
colorings
colorings
are
used
in
the
making
of
confections
candy
in
particular
for
two
purposes
to
make
them
attractive
and
to
indicate
certain
flavors
for
instance
candies
flavored
with
wintergreen
are
usually
colored
pink
while
those
containing
peppermint
are
colored
pale
green
or
are
left
white
strawberry
and
rose
flavors
are
also
colored
pink
orange
and
lemon
their
respective
shades
of
yellow
violet
lavender
and
pistachio
and
almond
green
the
substances
used
for
coloring
confections
are
of
two
general
classes
and
or
the
vegetable
colorings
like
the
natural
flavorings
are
considered
to
be
the
most
healthful
ones
some
of
the
chemical
colorings
are
derivatives
of
coal
tar
just
as
are
the
flavorings
cochineal
a
red
color
extracted
from
the
bodies
of
cochineal
insects
is
a
coloring
matter
much
used
in
the
preparation
of
confections
these
coloring
materials
may
be
purchased
in
several
forms
the
ones
most
commonly
used
come
in
the
form
of
liquid
or
paste
but
frequently
colorings
are
to
be
had
in
powder
or
tablet
form
discretion
must
always
be
observed
in
the
use
of
colorings
because
of
their
concentration
they
must
be
greatly
diluted
and
used
in
only
very
small
amounts
as
is
well
known
pale
colors
in
candies
are
always
more
attractive
than
deep
ones
then
too
when
candies
contain
much
color
most
persons
are
likely
to
consider
them
harmful
to
eat
to
get
the
best
results
only
a
little
coloring
should
be
added
at
a
time
and
each
amount
added
should
be
mixed
in
thoroughly
then
the
danger
of
getting
too
much
coloring
will
be
avoided
it
should
be
remembered
however
that
if
colored
candies
are
kept
for
any
length
of
time
or
are
exposed
to
the
light
they
will
fade
to
a
certain
extent
consequently
these
may
be
colored
a
little
more
deeply
than
those
which
are
to
be
used
at
once
acids
to
prevent
the
creaming
or
the
crystallizing
of
such
candy
as
taffy
an
acid
of
some
kind
is
generally
used
with
the
cane
sugar
in
the
making
of
this
variety
of
confection
the
acid
upon
being
boiled
with
the
sugar
changes
a
part
of
the
cane
sugar
to
invert
sugar
and
as
this
does
not
crystallize
the
candy
will
not
become
sugary
a
similar
effect
is
obtained
by
adding
glucose
in
sufficient
amounts
since
it
does
not
crystallize
the
cane
sugar
is
prevented
from
becoming
sugary
the
acids
most
commonly
used
for
this
purpose
are
cream
of
tartar
acetic
acid
vinegar
which
has
acetic
acid
for
its
basis
and
lemon
juice
which
has
citric
acid
for
its
basis
with
each
pound
of
sugar
it
will
be
necessary
to
use
teaspoonful
of
cream
of
tartar
or
drops
of
acetic
acid
or
tablespoonful
of
vinegar
or
lemon
juice
in
order
to
prevent
crystallization
lemon
juice
and
vinegar
are
much
more
likely
to
flavor
the
candy
than
are
cream
of
tartar
and
acetic
acid
often
if
a
creamy
candy
is
desired
a
small
amount
of
one
of
these
acids
is
used
even
in
small
quantities
they
will
prevent
the
crystallization
that
is
the
natural
result
of
the
cooking
and
stirring
of
the
cane
sugar
when
nothing
is
done
to
prevent
it
food
materials
in
addition
to
the
ingredients
already
mentioned
there
are
a
number
of
materials
that
may
be
used
in
the
making
of
candy
to
provide
food
value
and
at
the
same
time
give
variety
and
improve
the
flavor
and
appearance
of
the
candy
chief
among
these
materials
are
coconut
cocoa
chocolate
nuts
candied
and
dried
fruits
milk
cream
butter
etc
their
value
in
candy
depends
on
their
use
so
it
is
well
to
understand
their
nature
and
the
methods
of
using
them
either
shredded
or
ground
coconut
is
often
used
in
candy
to
give
it
flavor
or
variety
coconut
for
this
purpose
may
be
secured
in
a
number
of
forms
a
coconut
itself
may
be
purchased
cracked
open
to
remove
the
flesh
and
then
prepared
either
by
grating
it
or
by
grinding
it
this
will
be
found
to
be
very
delicious
and
preferable
to
any
other
kind
however
if
it
is
not
desired
to
prepare
the
coconut
in
the
home
this
material
may
be
purchased
shredded
in
boxes
or
in
cans
that
which
comes
in
boxes
is
usually
somewhat
dry
and
is
often
found
to
be
quite
hard
the
canned
varieties
remain
soft
since
the
shredded
coconut
is
mixed
with
the
milk
of
the
coconut
but
these
have
the
disadvantage
of
not
keeping
very
well
any
coconut
that
becomes
too
dry
for
use
may
be
softened
by
steaming
it
cocoa
and
in
the
making
of
confections
cocoa
and
chocolate
are
used
extensively
for
both
flavoring
and
coating
either
of
them
may
be
used
for
flavoring
purposes
but
chocolate
is
always
preferable
because
it
has
a
richer
deeper
flavor
than
cocoa
bitter
chocolate
should
be
used
in
preference
to
any
kind
of
sweet
chocolate
when
it
is
to
be
cooked
with
candy
for
flavoring
it
may
be
added
to
the
other
ingredients
in
pieces
and
allowed
to
melt
during
the
cooking
it
is
often
used
without
cooking
however
as
when
it
is
added
to
material
that
is
to
be
used
as
centers
for
bonbons
or
opera
creams
in
such
an
event
it
is
first
melted
over
steam
or
hot
water
and
then
worked
into
the
candy
when
desired
for
coating
chocolate
that
is
sweetened
is
usually
employed
although
many
persons
are
fond
of
creams
that
have
a
bitter
coating
sometimes
a
coating
that
is
a
slightly
sweetened
chocolate
is
used
and
for
most
purposes
a
coating
of
this
kind
is
preferred
such
chocolate
must
usually
be
purchased
from
a
store
where
confectioner
supplies
are
sold
or
from
a
establishment
milk
chocolate
and
very
sweet
coatings
may
also
be
purchased
for
coating
but
the
eating
chocolate
that
is
sold
in
bars
will
not
produce
satisfactory
results
and
so
should
never
be
used
for
coating
purposes
candied
and
dried
many
varieties
of
candied
or
crystallized
fruits
and
flowers
find
a
place
in
the
making
of
confections
sometimes
they
are
used
as
an
ingredient
while
other
times
they
are
added
to
bonbons
and
chocolates
merely
for
decorative
purposes
again
they
are
often
used
in
boxes
of
fancy
candies
that
are
packed
to
sell
at
some
special
event
or
to
give
away
they
are
somewhat
expensive
to
purchase
but
if
they
are
properly
used
they
add
such
an
appetizing
touch
and
produce
such
gratifying
and
delightful
results
that
the
expenditure
for
them
is
well
justified
many
of
these
may
be
prepared
in
the
home
with
a
certain
degree
of
satisfaction
the
two
candied
fruits
most
frequently
used
are
candied
pineapple
and
candied
cherries
but
in
addition
to
these
candied
apricots
peaches
pears
limes
lemons
and
oranges
are
often
found
in
the
market
cherries
preserved
in
maraschino
wine
and
creme
de
menthe
add
attractive
touches
of
color
to
candies
and
make
delicious
confections
when
coated
with
bonbon
cream
or
chocolate
crystallized
violets
rose
petals
and
mint
leaves
are
used
frequently
in
the
preparation
of
confections
they
are
added
merely
for
decoration
and
make
very
attractive
candies
they
can
usually
be
purchased
in
confectionery
stores
several
varieties
of
dried
fruits
chief
among
which
are
dates
figs
and
raisins
are
useful
in
the
making
of
confections
they
have
the
advantage
of
not
requiring
complicated
manipulation
and
at
the
same
time
they
lend
themselves
to
a
number
of
delicious
confections
that
may
often
be
eaten
by
persons
who
can
not
eat
anything
so
rich
as
candy
children
can
usually
partake
of
confections
made
of
these
fruits
without
harm
when
candy
would
disagree
with
them
nuts
of
various
kinds
probably
have
more
extensive
use
in
the
making
of
confections
than
any
other
class
of
foods
in
fact
there
are
few
kinds
of
candy
that
can
not
be
much
improved
by
the
addition
of
nuts
halves
of
such
nuts
as
english
walnuts
and
pecans
are
frequently
used
by
being
pressed
into
the
outside
of
bonbons
and
chocolates
then
too
pieces
of
various
kinds
of
nuts
are
used
with
a
filling
for
coated
candies
such
nuts
as
almonds
filberts
walnuts
and
peanuts
are
often
covered
singly
or
in
clusters
with
the
same
chocolate
coating
that
is
used
to
coat
creams
pistachio
nuts
which
are
light
green
in
color
are
either
chopped
or
used
in
halves
on
chocolates
or
bonbons
when
nuts
are
not
desired
whole
for
confections
they
should
never
be
put
through
a
food
chopper
rather
they
should
always
be
broken
up
by
being
cut
or
chopped
with
a
knife
the
simplest
way
in
which
to
cut
them
is
to
spread
the
nuts
in
a
single
layer
on
a
board
and
then
with
a
sharp
knife
press
down
on
them
having
one
hand
on
the
back
of
the
knife
near
the
point
and
the
other
on
the
handle
and
rocking
the
knife
back
and
forth
across
the
nuts
until
they
are
as
fine
as
desired
they
may
also
be
chopped
in
a
chopping
bowl
or
cut
one
at
a
time
with
a
small
sharp
knife
salted
nuts
while
not
a
confection
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
are
closely
related
to
confections
since
they
are
used
for
the
same
purpose
for
this
reason
it
seems
advisable
to
give
the
methods
of
preparing
them
in
connection
with
the
preparation
of
confections
pop
an
excellent
confection
and
one
that
always
appeals
to
children
may
be
made
from
pop
corn
this
variety
of
indian
corn
has
small
kernels
with
or
without
sharp
points
to
prepare
it
for
confections
the
kernels
or
grains
are
removed
from
the
ears
and
then
exposed
to
heat
in
a
corn
popper
or
a
covered
pan
when
they
become
sufficiently
hot
they
pop
or
explode
that
is
they
rupture
their
yellow
coat
and
turn
inside
out
the
popped
kernels
may
be
eaten
in
this
form
by
merely
being
salted
or
they
may
be
treated
with
various
sugar
preparations
in
the
ways
explained
later
milk
cream
and
milk
is
extensively
used
in
the
making
of
candy
both
to
obtain
a
certain
flavor
and
to
secure
a
particular
consistency
skim
milk
may
be
used
for
this
purpose
but
the
richer
the
milk
the
better
will
be
the
flavor
of
the
finished
candy
cream
of
course
makes
the
most
delicious
candy
but
as
it
is
usually
expensive
it
greatly
increases
the
cost
of
the
confection
butter
may
be
used
with
milk
to
obtain
a
result
similar
to
that
secured
by
the
use
of
cream
if
skim
milk
is
used
butter
should
by
all
means
be
added
for
it
greatly
improves
the
flavor
of
the
candy
in
any
recipe
requiring
milk
condensed
or
evaporated
milk
may
be
substituted
with
very
satisfactory
results
these
milks
may
be
diluted
as
much
as
is
desired
besides
providing
flavor
milk
cream
and
butter
add
food
value
to
the
confections
in
which
they
are
used
most
of
this
is
in
the
form
of
fat
a
food
substance
that
is
not
supplied
by
any
other
ingredients
except
perhaps
chocolate
and
nuts
they
are
therefore
particularly
valuable
and
should
always
be
used
properly
in
order
that
the
most
good
may
be
derived
from
them
the
chief
problem
in
the
use
of
milk
is
to
keep
it
from
curding
and
if
curding
takes
place
to
prevent
the
curds
from
settling
and
burning
during
the
boiling
when
maple
sirup
molasses
or
other
substances
that
are
liable
to
curdle
milk
are
to
be
cooked
with
the
milk
a
little
soda
should
be
added
or
if
possible
the
milk
should
be
heated
well
before
it
is
put
in
when
it
can
be
done
the
milk
should
be
cooked
with
the
sugar
before
the
ingredients
likely
to
make
it
curdle
are
added
in
case
the
milk
does
curdle
the
mixture
should
be
treated
at
once
or
the
result
will
be
very
unsatisfactory
the
best
plan
consists
in
beating
the
mixture
rapidly
with
a
rotary
egg
beater
in
order
to
break
up
the
curds
as
fine
as
possible
and
then
stirring
it
frequently
during
the
boiling
to
keep
the
milk
from
settling
and
burning
as
this
stirring
is
a
disadvantage
in
the
making
of
candy
every
precaution
should
be
taken
to
prevent
the
curding
of
the
milk
equipment
for
confection
making
the
utensils
for
candy
making
are
few
in
number
and
simple
in
nature
as
with
all
of
the
more
elaborate
foods
the
fancy
candies
require
slightly
more
unusual
equipment
and
even
for
the
more
ordinary
kinds
it
is
possible
to
buy
convenient
utensils
that
will
make
results
a
little
more
certain
but
as
illustrated
in
fig
which
shows
the
general
equipment
for
confection
making
practically
all
the
utensils
required
are
to
be
found
in
every
kitchen
illustration
fig
to
boil
the
confectionery
ingredients
a
saucepan
or
a
kettle
is
required
this
may
be
made
of
copper
or
aluminum
or
of
any
of
the
various
types
of
enamelware
that
are
used
for
cooking
utensils
one
important
requirement
is
that
the
surface
of
the
pan
be
perfectly
smooth
a
pan
that
has
become
rough
from
usage
or
an
enamelware
pan
that
is
chipped
should
not
be
used
for
the
boiling
of
candy
the
size
of
the
utensil
to
use
depends
on
the
kind
and
the
amount
of
the
mixture
to
be
boiled
a
mixture
does
not
require
a
pan
much
larger
in
size
than
is
necessary
to
hold
the
mixture
itself
for
it
does
not
expand
much
in
boiling
however
a
mixture
containing
milk
condensed
milk
cream
or
butter
should
be
cooked
in
a
pan
much
larger
than
is
needed
for
the
same
quantity
of
sugar
and
water
for
such
a
mixture
expands
greatly
and
is
liable
to
boil
over
the
necessary
size
of
the
pan
to
be
used
should
be
overestimated
rather
than
underestimated
in
the
cooking
of
candy
just
as
in
the
cooking
of
other
foods
the
surface
exposed
to
the
heat
and
the
depth
of
the
material
to
be
cooked
affect
the
rapidity
of
cooking
and
evaporation
consequently
if
rapid
evaporation
and
quick
cooking
are
desired
a
pan
that
is
broad
and
comparatively
shallow
should
be
used
rather
than
one
that
is
narrow
and
deep
measuring
cups
and
spoons
a
spoon
for
stirring
and
a
knife
are
of
course
essential
in
making
confections
then
too
it
is
often
convenient
to
have
a
metal
spatula
and
a
wooden
spoon
or
spatula
when
these
utensils
are
made
of
wood
they
are
light
in
weight
and
consequently
excellent
for
stirring
and
beating
if
egg
whites
are
used
in
the
preparation
of
a
confection
an
egg
whip
is
needed
when
candy
must
be
poured
into
a
pan
to
harden
any
variety
of
pan
may
be
used
but
generally
one
having
square
corners
is
the
most
satisfactory
then
if
the
candy
is
cut
into
squares
none
of
it
will
be
wasted
in
the
cutting
a
thermometer
that
registers
as
high
as
or
degrees
fahrenheit
is
a
valuable
asset
in
candy
making
when
recipes
giving
the
temperature
to
which
the
boiling
must
be
carried
are
followed
a
degree
of
accuracy
can
be
obtained
in
this
way
by
the
inexperienced
candy
maker
that
can
not
be
matched
with
the
usual
tests
a
small
thermometer
may
be
used
but
the
larger
the
thermometer
the
easier
will
it
be
to
determine
the
degrees
on
the
mercury
column
a
new
thermometer
should
always
be
tested
to
determine
its
accuracy
to
do
this
stand
the
thermometer
in
a
small
vessel
of
warm
water
place
the
vessel
over
a
flame
and
allow
the
water
to
boil
if
the
thermometer
does
not
register
degrees
at
boiling
the
number
of
degrees
more
or
less
must
be
taken
into
account
whenever
the
thermometer
is
used
for
instance
if
the
thermometer
registers
degrees
at
boiling
and
a
recipe
requires
candy
to
be
boiled
to
degrees
it
will
be
necessary
to
boil
the
candy
to
degrees
because
the
thermometer
registers
degrees
lower
than
it
should
the
double
boiler
also
finds
a
place
in
candy
making
for
melting
chocolate
coating
for
bonbons
or
fondant
for
reception
wafers
a
utensil
of
this
kind
is
necessary
one
that
will
answer
the
purpose
very
well
may
be
improvised
by
putting
a
smaller
pan
into
a
larger
one
containing
water
in
using
one
of
this
kind
however
an
effort
should
be
made
to
have
the
pans
exactly
suited
to
each
other
in
size
otherwise
the
water
in
the
lower
pan
will
be
liable
to
splash
into
the
pan
containing
the
material
that
is
being
heated
for
the
coating
of
bonbons
a
coating
fork
which
is
merely
a
thin
wire
twisted
to
make
a
handle
with
a
loop
at
one
end
is
the
most
convenient
utensil
to
use
however
this
is
not
satisfactory
for
coating
with
chocolate
a
different
method
being
required
for
this
material
a
number
of
candies
such
as
fondant
bonbon
creams
and
cream
centers
for
chocolates
can
be
made
much
more
satisfactorily
if
after
they
are
boiled
they
are
poured
on
a
flat
surface
to
cool
such
treatment
permits
them
to
cool
as
quickly
as
possible
in
a
comparatively
thin
layer
and
thus
helps
to
prevent
crystallization
when
only
a
small
amount
of
candy
is
to
be
made
a
large
platter
which
is
the
easiest
utensil
to
procure
produces
fairly
good
results
for
larger
amounts
as
for
instance
when
candy
is
being
made
to
sell
some
more
convenient
arrangement
must
be
made
the
most
satisfactory
thing
that
has
been
found
for
cooling
purposes
is
a
marble
slab
such
as
is
found
on
an
table
or
dresser
if
one
of
these
is
not
available
and
the
kitchen
or
pastry
table
has
a
vitrolite
or
other
heavy
top
resembling
porcelain
this
will
make
a
very
good
substitute
to
prevent
the
hot
candy
from
running
off
after
it
is
poured
on
a
slab
or
any
similar
flat
surface
a
device
of
some
kind
should
be
provided
a
very
satisfactory
one
consists
of
four
metal
bars
about
to
inch
in
width
and
thickness
and
as
long
as
desired
to
fit
the
slab
but
usually
about
inches
in
length
they
may
be
procured
from
a
factory
where
steel
and
iron
work
is
done
or
they
may
be
purchased
from
firms
selling
supplies
these
bars
are
merely
placed
on
top
of
the
slab
or
flat
surface
with
the
corners
carefully
fitted
and
the
candy
is
then
poured
in
the
space
between
the
bars
when
it
is
desired
to
pour
out
fudge
caramels
and
similar
candies
to
harden
before
cutting
the
metal
bars
may
be
fitted
together
and
then
placed
on
the
slab
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
most
convenient
fudge
however
may
be
cooled
satisfactorily
in
the
pan
in
which
it
is
cooked
if
the
cooling
is
done
very
rapidly
a
satisfactory
cooling
slab
may
be
improvised
by
fastening
four
pieces
of
wood
together
so
as
to
fit
the
outside
edge
of
the
slab
and
extend
an
inch
or
more
above
the
surface
if
such
a
device
is
used
plaster
of
paris
should
be
poured
around
the
edge
of
the
slab
to
fill
any
space
between
the
wood
and
the
slab
in
using
a
slab
or
similar
surface
for
purposes
of
this
kind
a
point
that
should
be
remembered
is
that
a
part
of
it
should
never
be
greased
but
should
be
reserved
for
the
cooling
of
fondant
and
certain
kinds
of
center
creams
which
require
only
a
moistened
surface
many
of
the
candies
that
are
turned
out
on
a
flat
surface
must
be
worked
to
make
them
creamy
for
this
purpose
nothing
is
quite
so
satisfactory
as
a
putty
knife
or
a
wallpaper
scraper
if
a
platter
is
used
a
putty
knife
is
preferable
for
it
has
a
narrower
blade
than
a
wallpaper
scraper
but
where
candy
is
made
in
quantity
and
a
large
slab
is
used
the
larger
scraper
does
the
work
better
for
use
with
a
platter
a
spoon
is
perhaps
the
best
utensil
when
a
putty
knife
is
not
in
supply
scales
are
valuable
in
candy
making
because
they
permit
exact
measurements
to
be
made
however
they
are
not
an
actual
necessity
for
almost
all
recipes
give
the
ingredients
by
measure
and
even
if
this
is
not
done
they
may
be
purchased
in
the
desired
weight
or
transposed
into
equivalent
measure
scales
of
course
are
required
if
it
is
desired
to
weigh
out
candy
in
small
amounts
or
in
boxes
after
it
is
made
waxed
paper
is
a
valuable
addition
to
supplies
there
being
many
occasions
for
its
use
for
instance
caramels
and
certain
other
candies
must
be
wrapped
and
waxed
paper
is
the
most
suitable
kind
for
this
purpose
then
too
candies
and
bonbons
must
be
placed
on
a
smooth
surface
to
which
they
will
not
stick
waxed
paper
is
largely
used
for
this
purpose
although
candy
makers
often
prefer
white
oilcloth
because
its
surface
is
ideal
and
it
can
be
cleansed
and
used
repeatedly
often
a
or
lining
that
has
been
pressed
smooth
with
a
warm
iron
may
be
utilized
for
such
purposes
as
when
reception
wafers
are
to
be
dropped
it
is
necessary
that
the
surface
of
the
paper
used
be
absolutely
unwrinkled
procedure
in
confection
making
cooking
the
mixture
weather
if
uniformly
good
results
are
desired
in
candy
making
certain
points
that
determine
the
success
or
failure
of
many
candies
although
seemingly
unimportant
must
be
observed
among
these
weather
conditions
form
such
a
large
factor
that
they
can
not
be
disregarded
a
cool
clear
day
when
the
atmosphere
is
fairly
dry
is
the
ideal
time
for
the
making
of
all
kinds
of
candies
warm
weather
is
not
favorable
because
the
candy
does
not
cool
rapidly
enough
after
being
cooked
damp
weather
is
very
bad
for
the
making
of
such
candies
as
the
creamy
ones
that
are
made
with
egg
white
and
that
are
desired
to
be
as
soft
as
possible
and
still
in
condition
to
handle
in
view
of
these
facts
candy
should
be
made
preferably
on
days
when
the
weather
is
favorable
if
the
element
of
uncertainty
so
far
as
results
are
concerned
would
be
eliminated
combining
the
sugar
and
the
proportion
of
liquid
and
sugar
to
use
in
making
candy
varies
to
some
extent
with
the
kind
of
ingredients
used
and
with
the
quantity
of
candy
being
made
in
the
making
of
quantities
up
to
several
pounds
the
usual
proportion
is
as
much
liquid
as
but
with
larger
amounts
of
sugar
the
quantity
of
liquid
may
be
slightly
decreased
with
the
quantities
decided
on
mix
the
sugar
and
liquid
and
put
them
over
the
fire
to
boil
stir
at
first
to
prevent
the
sugar
from
settling
and
burning
continuing
the
stirring
either
constantly
or
at
intervals
until
the
boiling
begins
at
this
point
discontinue
the
stirring
if
possible
mixtures
that
do
not
contain
milk
usually
require
no
further
stirring
and
many
times
stirring
is
unnecessary
even
in
those
which
do
contain
milk
but
whenever
any
stirring
is
required
as
little
as
possible
should
be
done
the
rule
that
applies
in
this
connection
is
that
the
sugar
should
be
entirely
dissolved
before
the
boiling
begins
and
that
all
unnecessary
agitation
should
then
cease
boiling
the
when
the
mixture
begins
to
boil
wash
down
the
sides
of
the
kettle
with
a
small
cloth
wet
with
clean
water
this
treatment
should
not
be
omitted
if
especially
nice
candy
is
desired
for
it
removes
all
undissolved
sugar
and
helps
to
prevent
crystallization
later
in
case
merely
sugar
and
water
make
up
the
ingredients
a
cover
may
be
placed
on
the
kettle
then
the
steam
that
is
retained
will
keep
any
sirup
that
may
splash
on
the
sides
from
crystallizing
this
can
not
be
done
however
with
mixtures
containing
milk
and
butter
for
they
will
in
all
probability
boil
over
the
boiling
of
candy
should
be
carried
on
quickly
for
slow
boiling
often
proves
a
disadvantage
a
mixture
may
of
course
be
boiled
more
rapidly
than
any
other
kind
because
there
is
not
the
danger
of
its
boiling
over
nor
of
burning
before
the
water
is
evaporated
that
there
is
with
a
mixture
containing
material
that
may
settle
and
burn
it
should
be
remembered
that
candy
does
not
begin
to
burn
until
the
water
has
entirely
evaporated
the
length
of
time
candy
should
boil
is
also
a
matter
to
which
attention
should
be
given
this
depends
somewhat
on
the
kind
that
is
being
made
but
largely
on
the
rapidity
with
which
the
boiling
is
carried
on
thus
to
time
the
boiling
of
candy
is
the
most
uncertain
way
of
determining
when
the
boiling
has
continued
long
enough
the
inaccuracy
of
measurement
the
size
and
shape
of
the
pan
and
the
rate
of
speed
in
boiling
cause
a
variation
in
the
time
required
consequently
it
would
be
rather
difficult
for
the
same
person
to
get
identical
conditions
twice
and
much
more
difficult
for
two
persons
to
produce
the
same
results
testing
since
accurate
results
can
not
be
obtained
by
timing
the
boiling
of
candy
other
tests
must
be
found
that
will
be
reliable
as
has
already
been
stated
a
thermometer
is
perhaps
the
most
accurate
means
that
can
be
adopted
for
this
purpose
however
if
one
is
not
available
the
testing
of
a
small
quantity
of
the
hot
mixture
by
cooling
it
in
cold
water
will
be
found
to
be
fairly
accurate
ice
water
is
not
necessary
nor
particularly
desirable
for
this
kind
of
testing
in
fact
water
just
as
it
comes
from
the
faucet
is
the
best
as
it
is
quickly
obtained
and
its
temperature
will
not
vary
greatly
except
in
very
hot
or
very
cold
weather
of
course
to
make
an
extremely
accurate
test
of
this
kind
it
would
be
necessary
always
to
have
the
water
at
the
same
temperature
a
condition
that
can
be
determined
only
by
testing
the
temperature
but
such
accuracy
is
not
usually
required
if
the
thermometer
is
used
all
that
need
be
done
is
to
insert
it
into
the
candy
and
allow
it
to
remain
there
until
the
temperature
is
registered
in
case
it
does
not
reach
the
right
temperature
the
first
time
keep
the
mixture
boiling
until
it
registers
the
temperature
that
is
decided
on
as
the
correct
one
to
test
the
mixture
by
the
water
method
allow
it
to
boil
almost
long
enough
to
be
done
and
then
try
it
at
close
intervals
when
it
is
nearing
the
end
of
the
boiling
dip
a
little
of
the
sirup
into
a
spoon
and
drop
it
slowly
into
a
cup
containing
a
little
water
not
much
sirup
is
needed
for
the
test
a
few
drops
being
sufficient
gather
the
drops
together
with
the
tips
of
the
fingers
and
judge
from
the
ball
that
forms
whether
the
candy
has
boiled
sufficiently
or
not
if
the
ball
is
not
of
the
right
consistency
boil
the
candy
a
little
longer
and
test
again
be
sure
however
to
get
fresh
water
for
each
test
when
the
candy
is
nearing
the
final
test
and
it
is
thought
that
the
mixture
has
boiled
enough
remove
the
pan
from
the
heat
while
the
test
is
being
made
so
that
the
boiling
will
not
be
continued
too
long
to
assist
in
making
the
tests
for
candy

must
be
cooked
longer
than
for
the
firm
ball
at
this
stage
the
ball
that
is
formed
may
be
rolled
in
the
finger
tips
it
is
not
so
hard
however
that
an
impression
can
not
be
made
in
it
with
the
fingers
it
is
the
test
for
caramels
soft
butter
scotch
sea
foam
and
many
other
candies
a
is
the
result
of
any
temperature
beyond
degrees
up
to
the
point
where
the
sugar
would
begin
to
burn
it
is
hard
enough
to
make
a
sound
when
struck
against
the
side
of
the
cup
or
to
crack
when
an
attempt
is
made
to
break
it
this
is
the
test
that
is
made
for
taffy
and
other
hard
candies
pouring
and
cooling
the
mixture
after
the
testing
of
the
mixture
proves
that
it
is
boiled
sufficiently
there
are
several
procedures
that
may
be
followed
the
one
to
adopt
depends
on
the
kind
of
candy
that
is
being
made
but
every
candy
that
is
cooked
should
be
cooled
by
one
of
the
following
methods
the
first
treatment
consists
in
pouring
the
mixture
at
once
from
the
pan
to
be
finished
without
cooling
as
for
instance
caramels
and
butter
scotch
which
are
poured
at
once
into
a
buttered
pan
to
be
cooled
and
cut
or
the
hot
sirup
may
be
poured
upon
beaten
egg
whites
as
in
the
case
of
sea
foam
or
penuchie
in
the
making
of
either
of
these
kinds
the
sirup
may
be
allowed
to
drip
as
completely
as
possible
from
the
pan
without
injury
to
the
finished
product
the
second
method
by
which
the
mixture
is
cooled
calls
for
cooling
the
sirup
in
the
pan
in
which
it
was
cooked
as
for
instance
in
the
case
of
fudge
when
this
is
done
the
pan
should
be
carried
from
the
stove
to
the
place
where
the
mixture
is
to
be
cooled
with
as
little
agitation
as
possible
also
during
the
cooling
it
should
not
be
disturbed
in
any
way
stirring
it
even
a
little
is
apt
to
start
crystallization
and
the
candy
will
then
be
grainy
instead
of
creamy
in
the
third
form
of
treatment
the
sirup
is
poured
out
and
then
cooled
before
it
is
stirred
to
make
it
creamy
as
in
opera
creams
or
bonbon
creams
to
accomplish
this
the
pan
should
be
tipped
quickly
and
all
its
contents
turned
out
at
once
it
should
not
be
allowed
to
drip
even
a
few
drops
for
this
dripping
starts
the
crystallization
candies
that
contain
milk
or
butter
or
sticky
materials
such
as
taffies
should
always
be
poured
on
a
buttered
surface
those
which
are
cooked
with
water
but
are
to
be
creamed
should
be
poured
on
a
surface
moistened
with
cold
water
when
candy
mixtures
are
cooled
before
being
completed
the
cooling
should
be
carried
to
the
point
where
no
heat
is
felt
when
the
candy
is
touched
to
test
it
the
backs
of
the
fingers
should
be
laid
lightly
on
the
surface
of
the
candy
as
they
will
not
be
so
likely
to
stick
as
the
moist
tips
on
the
palm
side
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
surface
must
not
be
disturbed
in
the
testing
as
this
is
also
apt
to
bring
about
crystallization
every
precaution
should
be
taken
to
prevent
even
the
smallest
amount
of
crystallization
any
crystals
that
may
have
formed
can
be
easily
detected
when
the
stirring
is
begun
by
the
scraping
that
can
be
felt
by
the
spoon
or
paddle
used
if
a
little
crystallization
has
taken
place
before
the
candy
has
cooled
completely
it
being
easily
seen
in
the
clear
sirup
the
mixture
should
be
cooled
still
further
for
nothing
is
gained
by
stirring
it
at
once
a
point
that
should
always
be
kept
in
mind
in
the
cooling
of
candy
is
that
it
should
be
cooled
as
quickly
as
possible
however
a
refrigerator
should
not
be
used
for
cooling
for
the
warm
mixture
raises
the
temperature
of
the
refrigerator
and
wastes
the
ice
and
at
the
same
time
the
moist
atmosphere
does
not
bring
about
the
best
results
as
has
already
been
learned
a
platter
or
a
slab
is
very
satisfactory
if
either
of
these
is
used
it
should
be
as
cold
as
possible
when
the
sirup
is
poured
on
it
cold
weather
of
course
simplifies
this
matter
greatly
but
if
no
better
way
is
afforded
the
utensil
used
should
be
cooled
with
cold
water
finishing
candies
the
treatment
through
which
candy
mixtures
are
put
after
being
cooled
varies
with
the
kind
of
candy
being
made
some
mixtures
as
fudge
are
beaten
until
creamy
in
the
pan
in
which
they
are
cooked
others
are
worked
on
a
platter
or
a
slab
with
the
proper
kind
of
utensil
these
are
usually
treated
in
a
rather
elaborate
way
being
often
coated
with
bonbon
cream
or
with
chocolate
still
others
such
as
taffy
are
pulled
until
light
in
color
and
then
cut
into
small
pieces
with
a
pair
of
scissors
again
certain
candies
after
being
poured
into
a
pan
are
allowed
to
become
hard
and
then
cut
into
squares
or
broken
into
pieces
usually
candies
made
in
the
home
are
served
without
being
wrapped
but
when
certain
varieties
are
to
be
packed
it
is
advisable
to
wrap
them
directions
for
finishing
confections
in
these
different
ways
are
here
given
marking
and
cutting
much
of
the
success
of
certain
candies
depends
on
their
treatment
after
being
cooled
those
which
must
be
beaten
in
the
pan
until
they
are
creamy
should
be
beaten
just
as
long
as
possible
then
if
the
surface
is
not
smooth
when
they
are
poured
out
pat
it
out
with
the
palm
of
the
hand
after
the
candy
has
hardened
a
little
as
soon
as
it
has
hardened
sufficiently
to
remain
as
it
is
marked
and
not
run
together
mark
it
in
pieces
of
the
desired
size
using
for
this
purpose
a
thin
sharp
knife
be
careful
to
have
the
lines
straight
and
the
pieces
even
in
size
generally
candy
that
is
treated
in
this
manner
is
cut
into
squares
although
it
may
be
cut
into
other
shapes
if
desired
coating
candies
with
bonbon
when
especially
nice
candy
is
desired
for
a
special
occasion
it
is
often
made
into
small
pieces
and
then
coated
with
bonbon
cream
a
large
number
of
the
centers
to
be
coated
should
be
made
up
before
the
coating
is
begun
in
fact
if
it
is
possible
all
the
centers
should
be
made
first
and
then
the
coating
can
proceed
without
interruption
the
cream
to
be
used
for
coating
may
be
flavored
or
colored
in
any
desirable
way
any
flavoring
or
coloring
that
is
to
be
used
however
should
be
added
while
the
cream
is
melting
to
coat
with
bonbon
cream
put
the
cream
in
a
double
boiler
without
any
water
and
allow
it
to
melt
with
as
little
stirring
as
possible
it
is
best
to
use
a
small
double
boiler
for
this
purpose
and
not
to
melt
too
much
of
the
cream
at
one
time
as
it
is
apt
to
become
grainy
if
it
is
used
too
long
for
dipping
when
it
has
melted
to
the
extent
that
the
coating
will
not
be
too
thick
after
it
has
cooled
the
dipping
of
the
candies
may
begin
as
soon
as
it
is
found
that
no
more
centers
can
be
dipped
in
the
cream
melt
some
fresh
cream
for
the
remaining
centers
but
do
not
add
it
to
that
which
has
been
used
before
instead
use
the
first
up
as
closely
as
possible
and
then
drop
the
remainder
by
spoonfuls
on
waxed
paper
with
all
of
it
used
wash
and
dry
the
inner
pan
of
the
double
boiler
and
start
again
with
a
fresh
lot
of
the
cream
to
coat
the
centers
drop
one
at
a
time
into
the
melted
cream
and
turn
over
with
a
coating
fork
or
an
ordinary
table
fork
when
the
surface
is
entirely
covered
lift
out
of
the
cream
with
the
fork
and
allow
any
superfluous
coating
to
drip
off
then
drop
the
coated
bonbons
on
waxed
paper
to
cool
while
this
work
may
prove
a
little
difficult
at
first
it
can
be
done
with
dexterity
after
a
little
practice
if
an
effort
is
made
to
have
the
centers
uniform
in
size
and
shape
the
finished
candies
will
have
the
same
appearance
while
the
cream
is
soft
tiny
pieces
of
candied
fruit
or
nuts
may
be
pressed
into
the
coating
to
decorate
the
bonbons
coating
with
candies
coated
with
chocolate
are
always
desirable
so
it
is
well
for
any
one
who
aspires
toward
confection
making
to
become
proficient
in
this
phase
of
the
work
the
centers
should
of
course
be
prepared
first
and
put
in
a
convenient
place
on
the
table
where
the
coating
is
to
be
done
they
may
be
made
in
any
desired
size
and
shape
if
it
is
possible
to
secure
a
regular
coating
chocolate
this
should
be
obtained
for
it
produces
better
results
than
does
a
chocolate
that
can
be
prepared
however
unless
one
lives
in
a
place
where
supplies
are
on
sale
it
is
almost
impossible
to
purchase
a
chocolate
of
this
kind
in
such
an
event
a
substitute
that
will
prove
very
satisfactory
for
candy
to
be
eaten
in
the
home
and
not
to
be
sold
may
be
made
as
follows

put
all
the
ingredients
in
a
double
boiler
and
allow
them
to
melt
being
careful
that
not
a
single
drop
of
water
nor
other
foreign
substance
falls
into
the
mixture
do
not
cover
the
boiler
for
then
the
steam
will
condense
on
the
inside
of
the
cover
and
fall
into
the
chocolate
as
this
will
spoil
the
chocolate
so
that
it
can
not
be
used
for
coating
the
pan
in
which
the
chocolate
is
melted
should
always
be
allowed
to
remain
open
the
paraffin
used
helps
to
harden
the
chocolate
after
it
is
put
on
the
centers
this
is
a
particular
advantage
at
any
time
but
especially
when
chocolates
are
made
in
warm
weather
when
the
chocolate
has
completely
melted
dip
some
of
it
into
a
small
bowl
or
other
dish
or
utensil
having
a
round
bottom
and
keep
the
rest
over
the
heat
so
that
it
will
not
harden

a
spoon
beat

which
is
put
into
the
bowl
until
it
is
cool
enough
to
permit
the
fingers
being
put
into
it
then
work
it
with
the
fingers
until
all
the
heat
is
out
of
it
and
it
begins
to
thicken
it
may
be
tested
at
this
point
by
putting
one
of
the
centers
into
it
if
it
is
found
to
be
too
thin
it
will
run
off
the
candy
and
make
large
flat
edges
on
the
bottom
in
such
an
event
work
it
and
cool
it
a
little
more
when
it
is
of
the
proper
thickness
put
the
centers
in
one
at
a
time
and
as
shown
in
fig
cover
them
completely
with
the
chocolate
and
place
them
on
waxed
paper
or
white
oilcloth
to
harden
as
they
harden
it
will
be
found
that
they
will
gradually
grow
dull
no
attempt
whatever
should
be
made
to
pick
up
these
candies
until
they
are
entirely
cold
this
process
is
sometimes
considered
objectionable
because
of
the
use
of
the
bare
hands
but
chocolate
coating
can
not
be
so
successfully
done
in
any
other
way
as
with
the
fingers
therefore
any
aversion
to
this
method
should
be
overcome
if
good
results
are

wrapping
such
candies
as
caramels
certain
kinds
of
taffies
and
even
chocolates
are
often
wrapped
in
waxed
paper
especially
if
they
are
to
be
packed
in
boxes
when
this
is
to
be
done
cut
the
paper
into
pieces
of
the
proper
size
and
then
wrap
each
piece
separately
the
best
way
to
prepare
the
paper
is
to
fold
several
sheets
until
they
are
the
desired
size
and
then
as
in

cut
them
with
a
sharp
knife
if
a

of
scissors
is
used
for

they
are
apt

cut

the
method
of
wrapping
depends
on
the
candy
itself
caramels
are
wrapped
in
square
pieces
whose
ends
are
folded
in
neatly
as
in

taffies
and

candies
nature
of
taffies
taffy
is
probably
one
of
the
simplest
candies
that
can
be
made
indeed
if
candy
of
this
kind
is
boiled
long
enough
it
is
almost
impossible
to
have
unsatisfactory
results
taffies
are
usually
made
from
white
sugar
but
a
variety
of
flavors
may
be
obtained
by
the
use
of
different
ingredients
and
flavors
for
instance
molasses
is
used
for
some
taffies
maple
sirup
for
others
and
brown
sugar
for
others
and
all
of
these
offer
an
opportunity
for
variety
then
again
taffy
made
from
white
sugar
may
be
varied
by
means
of
many
delightful
colors
and
flavors
melted
chocolate
or
cocoa
also
makes
a
delightful
taffy
recipes
for
all
of
these
varieties
are

a
number
of
recipes
for
closely
related
confections
such
as
butter

bars
methods
of
treating
taffy
may
be
poured
out
in
a
pan
allowed
to
become
entirely
cold
and
then
broken
into
irregular
pieces
for
serving
or
it
may
be
pulled
and
then
cut
in
small
pieces
with
a
pair
of
scissors
if
it
is
to
be
pulled
it
should
be
poured
from
the
pan
in
which
it
is
cooked
into
flat
pans
or
plates
and
set
aside
to
cool
as
soon
as
it
is
cool
enough
to
handle
it
may
be
taken
from
the
pans
and
pulled
it
will
be
found
that
the
edges
will
cool
and
harden
first
these
should
be
pulled
toward
the
center
and
folded
so
that
they
will
warm
against
the
center
and
form
a
new
edge
if
this
is
done
two
or
three
times
during
the
cooling
the
candy
will
cool
evenly
and
be
ready
to
take
up
into
the
hands
the
pulling
may
then
begin
at
once
if
it
has
been
cooked
enough
it
will
not
stick
to
the
hands
during
the
pulling
it
is
usually
wise
however
to
take
the
precaution
of
dusting
the
hands
with
corn
starch
before
starting
to
pull
the
candy
grease
should
never
be
used
for
this
purpose
when
taffy
is
made
in
quantities
the
work
of
pulling
it
is
greatly
lessened
by
stretching
it
over
a
large
hook
fastened
securely
to
a
wall
recipes
for
taffy

the
taffy
explained
in
the
accompanying

is
flavored
with
vanilla
and
when
pulled
is
white
in
color
however
it
may
be

by
merely

vanilla
is
the
one

taffy
because
butter
is
used
in

large
amount

be
noted
also
that
brown
sugar

peanut
peanuts
are
often
used
in
confection
making
and
are
very
much
liked
by
the
majority
of
persons
they
come
in
two
general
varieties
which
may
be
roasted
before
use
or
used
unroasted
and
it
is
well
for
the
housewife
to
understand
the
difference
between
them
one
variety
is
the
large
oblong
peanut
generally
sold
at
peanut
stands
and
used
for
the
salted
peanuts
sold
in
confectionery
stores
the
other
is
the
variety
known
as
spanish
peanuts
which
are
small
and
round
for
some
candies
it
is
necessary
that
the
peanuts
be
roasted
and
the
skins
removed
while
for
others
unroasted
peanuts
with
the
skins
on
are
desirable
to
remove
the
skins
from
unroasted
peanuts
they
must
be
blanched
by
immersing
them
in
boiling
water
until
the
skins
will
slip
off
easily
but
in
the
case
of
roasted
peanuts
the
skins
may
be
removed
without
blanching
peanut
brittle
is
one
of
the
candies
in
which
peanuts
are
used
as
its
name
implies
it
is
very
thin
and
brittle
and
it
usually
contains
a
great
many
peanuts
two
recipes
for
candy
of
this
kind
are
here
given
one
requiring
peanuts
that
are
roasted
and
blanched
and
the
other
peanuts
that
are
unroasted
and
not
blanched

a
clear
liquid
is
formed

care
not
to
allow
it

a
pan
greased
and
covered
with
a
thick

that
the
peanuts
are
roasted
remove
from
the
fire
add
the
vanilla
and
the
soda
and
stir
rapidly
then
pour
the
mixture
which
will
become
thick
upon
the
addition
of
the
soda
on
a
flat
greased
surface
a
slab
is
better
for
this
purpose
than
anything
else
but
if
this
can
not
be
obtained
a
metal
or
other
hard
table
top
may
be
used
when
the
candy
begins
to
get
stiff
loosen
it
from
the
surface
on
which
it
was
poured
cut
it
into
two
pieces
and
turn
each
over
or
if
it
can
be
handled
without
cutting
turn
the
entire
piece
over
then
stretch
the
candy
until
it
is
just
as
thin
as
possible
beginning
around
the
edge
as
it
becomes
colder
stretch
even
thinner
when
entirely
cool
break
into
pieces
and
serve
nut
another
excellent
nut
candy
can
be
made
by
pouring
a
sirup
made
of
sugar
corn
sirup
and
water
over
a
thick
layer
of
nuts
such
fruits
as
dates
and
figs

or
a
combination
of
these
may
be
used
with
the
nuts

spread
the
nuts
on
a

slab
or
pan
and
to
them
add
fruit
or
coconut
if
it
is
desired
to
use
either
of
these
pour
the
hot
sirup
over
this
until
it
is
about
inch
in
thickness
when
sufficiently
cool
cut
in
pieces
of
any
desirable
size
using
a
quick
sliding
motion
of
the

caramels
nature
of
caramels
are
included
among
the
popular
candies
and
they
may
be
made
in
many
varieties
to
plain
vanilla
caramels
which
are
the
simplest
kind
to
make
may
be
added
any
desirable
color
or
flavor
at
the
time
they
are
removed
from
the
fire
to
keep
caramels
from
crystallizing
after
they
are
boiled
glucose
in
some
form
must
be
used
and
the
most
convenient
kind
to
secure
is
corn
sirup
then
too
caramels
will
cut
more
easily
and
will
have
less
of
a
sticky
consistency
if
a
small
piece
of
paraffin
is
boiled
with
the
mixture
the
addition
of
this
material
or
any
wax
that
is
not
a
food
is
contrary
to
the
laws
and
such
candy
can
not
be
sold
however
paraffin
is
not
harmful
but
is
merely
a
substance
that
is
not
digested
so
that
the
small
amount
taken
by
eating
candy
in
which
it
is
used
can
not
possibly
cause
any
injury
in
the
making
of
caramels
it
should
be
remembered
that
good
results
depend
on
boiling
the
mixture
to
just
the
right
point
if
they
are
not
boiled
enough
they
will
be
too
soft
to
retain
their
shape
when
cut
and
if
they
are
cooked
too
long
they
will
be
brittle
neither
of
these
conditions
is
the
proper
consistency
for
caramels
to
be
right
they
must
be
boiled
until
a
temperature
of
to
degrees
is
reached
however
chocolate
caramels
need
not
be
boiled
so
long
as
the
chocolate
helps
to
harden
them
plain
the
accompanying
recipe
for
plain
caramels
may
be
made
just
as
it
is
given
or
to
it
may
be
added
any
flavoring
or
coloring
desired
a
pink
color
and
strawberry
flavor
are
very
often
found
in
caramels
and
are
considered
to
be
a
delicious
combination
as
will
be
noted
white
sugar
is
called
for
but
if
more
of
a
caramel
flavor
is
preferred
brown
sugar
may
be
used
instead
of
white
maple
sugar
may
also
be
used
in
candy
of
this
kind
nuts
fruits
or
coconut
or
any
mixture
of
these
materials
improves
plain
caramels
wonderfully
if
they
are

they
should
be
stirred

the
time
it
is
removed
from
the
fire
plain

milk
sugar

the
milk
used
for
making
caramels
should
be
as
rich
as
possible
in
fact
if
cream
can
be
used
the
candy
will
be
very
much
better
add
half
of
the

to
the
sugar
and

and
put
over
the
fire
to

allow
this

to

will
form
when

the

cold
should
have
exactly
the
same
consistency
as
the
finished
caramels
toward
the
end
of
the
boiling
it
is
necessary
to
stir
the
mixture
almost
constantly
to
prevent
it
from
burning
when
done
pour
it
out
on
a
buttered
slab
or

that
is
bearing
down

away
from
you
at
the
same
time
if
the
caramels
are
to
be
packed
or
kept
for
any
length
of
time
it
is
well
to
wrap
them
in
waxed
paper
before
attempting
to
use
caramels
however
they
should
be
allowed
to
stand
overnight
in
a
cool

not
in

refrigerator
chocolate
when

caramels
are

the
amount
of

cream
candies
natures
of
cream
candies
there
are
numerous
varieties
of
cream
candies
some
of
which
must
be
made
with
great
care
while
others
may
be
made
quickly
and
easily
for
instance
fudge
penuchie
divinity
and
sea
foam
are
examples
of
cream
candies
that
do
not
require
long
preparation
but
these
must
generally
be
used
up
quickly
as
they
do
not
stay
soft
upon
exposure
to
the
air
unless
it
is
very
moist
on
the
other
hand
such
cream
candies
as
opera
cream
fondant
center
cream
and
orientals
require
both
care
and
time
in
their
preparation
if
these
are
properly
looked
after
they
may
be
kept
for
some
time
in
fact
it
is
necessary
that
some
of
them
stand
for
several
days
before
they
can
be
made
into
the
numerous
varieties
to
which
they
lend
themselves
the
main
point
to
consider
in
the
preparation
of
all
cream
candies
is
that
crystallization
of
the
sugar
which
is
commonly
called
must
be
prevented
if
a
creamy
mixture
is
to
be
the
result
candies
of
this
kind
are
not
palatable
unless
they
are
soft
and
creamy
however
no
difficulty
will
be
experienced
in
preparing
delicious
cream
candies
if
the
principles
of
candy
making
previously
given
are
applied
fudges
and
related
candies
fudge
no
probably
no
other
candy
is
so
well
known
and
so
often
made
as
fudge
even
persons
little
experienced
in
candy
making
have
success
with
candy
of
this
kind
another
advantage
of
fudge
is
that
it
can
be
made
up
quickly
very
little
time
being
required
in
its
preparation
several

nature
of

for
which

is
used
it
can
of
course
be
coated
with
chocolate
if
desired
some
persons
have
an
idea
that
fondant
and
related
candies
are
difficult
to
make
but
if
directions
are
followed
carefully
this
will
not
be
the
case
illustration
fig
in
the
first
place
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
weather
is
an
important
factor
in
the
success
of
candy
of
this
kind
a
clear
cold
day
should
be
selected
for
it
is
difficult
to
make
fondant
successfully
on
a
warm
or
a
damp
day
then
too
it
is
an
excellent
plan
to
make
more
than
can
be
used
at
one
time
for
no
greater
labor
will
be
involved
in
the
making
of
a
large
amount
than
a
small
amount
and
better
results
may
be
expected
if
the
fondant
material
is
cared
for
properly
small
quantities
of
it
may
be
made
up
as
desired
therefore
if
convenient
equipment
is
on
hand
for
making
candies
of
this
type
no
less
than
pounds
should
be
made
at
one
time
five
pounds
is
a
preferable
amount
but
if
desired
pounds
may
be
made
up
at
one
time
although
this
amount
is
about
as
much
as
one
person
can
handle
and
even
this
is
somewhat
difficult
for
some
to
work
up
illustration
fig
a
little
ingenuity
on
the
part
of
the
person
making
up
the
fondant
will
result
in
many
delightful
bonbons
candied
fruits
nuts
coconut
and
numerous
varieties
of
flavoring
and
coloring
may
be
utilized
very
successfully
with

it
should
be
remembered
however
that
bonbons
do
not
keep
fresh
for
more
than
a
few
days
or
a
week
at
the
most
if
they
are
exposed
to
the
air
if
it
is
desired
to
keep
them
for
any
length
of
time
they
should
be
packed
in
a
tin
box
but
when
stored
in
this
way
different
colors
should
not
be
placed
next
to
each
other
or
they
will
mix
as
will
be
noted
the
accompanying
recipe
for
fondant
calls
for
pounds
of
sugar
it
is
not
necessary
that
all
of
the
fondant
be
worked
up
at
once
indeed
it
is
suggested
that
this
amount
be
prepared
and
then
stored
so
that
the
fondant
may
be
used
as
needed
if
a
smaller
amount
should
be
desired

if
the

is
to
be
stored
for
some
time
it
may
be
boiled
to
degrees
but
for
general
use
a
mixture
that
reaches
a
temperature
of

will
be
the
most
satisfactory
if
the
water

is
applied
as
in

rather
than

of
the

in

it
is
at
this
point
that
crystallization
begins
and
the
fondant
instead
of
being
creamy
will
become
grainy

as
quickly
as
possible

as
to
lessen
the
chances
for
crystallization
to
begin
and
do
not
disturb
the
sirup
in
any
way
during
the
cooling
the
best
way
in
which
to
accomplish
this
is
to
put

be
found
that
two

can
be
dropped
from

before
the

becomes
too
cold

pour
but
usually
it
is
necessary
to
dip
a
fresh
spoonful
for
each
wafer

an

in
the

it
is
more

but
success
can
be
had
with
this
as

as
with
other

the

the

quantity
for
it
is

place
a

of
days
the
molds
for
shaping
center
creams
are
formed
in
a
thick
layer
of
corn
starch
by
means
of
a
device
that
may
be
bought
from
a
supply
house
or
made
at
home
this
device
consists
of
a
long
strip
with
projections
that
may
be
pushed
into
the
corn
starch
to
make
neatly
shaped
holes
or
molds
these
projections
are
spaced
about
inch
apart
so
that
the
walls
between
the
molds
will
not
fall
down
when
the
mixture
is
poured
into
them
a
long
stick
such
as
a
ruler
or
a
yardstick
and
either
corks
of
different
sizes
or
plaster
of
paris
may
be
employed
to
make
such
a
device
if
corks
are
to
be
used
simply
glue
them
to
the
stick
spacing
them
about
inch
apart
if
plaster
of
paris
is
to
be
used
fill
small
receptacles
about
the
size
and
shape
of
chocolate
creams
with
a
thin
mixture
of
plaster
of

and
water
and
allow
it
to
set
when
hard
remove
the
shapes
and
glue
them
to
the
stick
spacing
them
the
same
distance
as
mentioned
for
the
corks
the
device
will
answer
the
same
purpose
as
one
that
is
bought
and
is
much
less
expensive
when
it
is
desired
to
make
up
the
creams
sift
corn
starch
into
a
pan
to
form
a
thick
layer
making
it
perfectly

with
the
straight
edge
of
a
knife
then

or

in
the

by
pressing
into
it
the
device
just
described
make
as
many
rows
of
molds
as
the
space
will
permit
but
do
not
make
them
so
close
together
as
to
weaken
the
walls
between
the
molds
melt
some
of
the
center
cream
in
a
double
boiler
color
and
flavor
as
desired
and
pour
into
the
molds
made
in
the
corn
starch
allow
the
centers
to
remain
until
they
become
hard
in
the
molds
then
pick
them
out
blow
off
the
corn
starch
and
set
aside
until
ready
to
coat
continue
making
centers
in
this
way
until
all
the
cream
is
used
up
resifting
the
corn
starch
and
making
new
molds
each
time
then
coat
with
chocolate
in
the
usual
way
delicious
chocolate
creams
known
as
orientals
can
be
made
by
the
amateur
if
a
little
care
is
exercised
it
should
be
remembered
however
that
these
can
not
be
made
successfully
on
a
damp
day
and
that
it
is
somewhat
difficult
to
make
them
in
warm
weather
a
clear
cold
day
is
required
for
satisfactory
results
unlike
fondant
these
creams
must
be
made
up
at
once
so
it
will
be
necessary
to
allow
sufficient
time
not
only
for
the
cooking
and
creaming
processes
but
also
for
the
making
and
coating
as
well
after
being
made
up
however
they
should
be
allowed
to
stand
for
or
days
as
they
like
many
other
cream
candies
improve
upon
standing
since
these
centers
are
very
sweet
a
slightly
bitter

the
best
kind
with
which
to

them
confectioner
chocolate

if
the

stiff
and
the
eggs

continue
with
a
little
patience
for
they
will
eventually
combine
with
the
candy
because
of
the
eggs
oriental
cream
is
whiter
than
bonbon
cream
and
so
it
is
a
little
difficult
to
tell
just
when
it

to
get
creamy
however
it
softens
a
little
as

be
careful
to
cover
the
entire
surface
with
chocolate
for
otherwise
the
quality
of
the

will
deteriorate
a
good
plan
is
to
wrap

of
this
kind
in

this

beverages
in
the
diet
nature
and
classes
of
beverages
throughout
the
lifetime
of
every
person
there
is
constant
need
for
solid
food
to
preserve
health
and
prolong
life
and
just
as
such
food
is
necessary
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
body
so
too
is
there
need
for
water
as
is
well
known
the
composition
of
the
body
is
such
that
it
contains
more
liquid
than
solid
material
the
tissues
and
the
bones
weighing
much
less
than
the
liquid
a
tremendous
amount
of
this
liquid
is
continually
being
lost
through
the
kidneys
through
each
pore
in
the
skin
and
even
through
every
breath
that
is
exhaled
and
if
continued
good
health
is
to
be
maintained
this
loss
must
be
constantly
made
up
this
loss
is
greater
in
very
hot
weather
or
in
the
performance
of
strenuous
exercise
than
under
ordinary
conditions
which
accounts
for
the
fact
that
more
than
the
usual
amount
of
liquid
must
be
supplied
during
such
times
so
necessary
is
liquid
refreshment
that
the
body
can
not
exist
without
it
for
any
great
length
of
time
in
fact
if
the
supply
were
cut
off
so
that
no
more
could
be
obtained
the
body
would
begin
to
use
its
own
fluids
and
death
would
soon
occur
a
person
can
live
for
many
days
without
solid
food
but
it
is
not
possible
to
live
for
more
than
a
very
few
days
without
drink
nature
way
of
serving
notice
that
the
body
is
in
need
of
liquid
refreshment
is
through
the
sensation
of
thirst
satisfying
thirst
not
only
brings
relief
but
produces
a
decidedly
pleasant
sensation
however
the
real
pleasure
of
drinking
is
not
experienced
until
one
has
become
actually
thirsty
the
various
liquids
by
which
thirst
may
be
slaked
or
quenched
are
known
as
the
first
one
of
these
given
to
man
was
water
and
it
is
still
the
chief
beverage
for
it
is
used
both
alone
and
as
a
foundation
for
numerous
other
beverages
that
are
calculated
to
be
more
tasty
but
whose
use
is
liable
in
some
cases
to
lead
to
excessive
drinking
or
to
the
partaking
of
substances
that
are
injurious
to
health
the
beverages
that
are
in
common
use
may
be
placed
in
three
general
classes
and
the
alcoholic
beverages
include
such
drinks
as
beer
wine
whisky
some
of
which
are
used
more
in
one
country
than
in
another
in
fact
almost
every
class
of
people
known
has
an
alcoholic
beverage
that
has
come
to
be
regarded
as
typical
of
that
class
alcoholic
fermentation
is
supposed
to
have
been
discovered
by
accident
and
when
its
effect
became
known
it
was
recognized
as
a
popular
means
of
supplying
a
beverage
and
some
stimulation
besides
under
stimulating
beverages
come
tea
coffee
and
cocoa
these
are
in
common
use
all
over
the
world
certain
ones
of
course
finding
greater
favor
in
some
countries
than
in
others
with
the
exception
of
cocoa
they
provide
very
little
food
value
in
contrast
with
these
drinks
are
the
beverages
which
include
fruit
punches
soft
drinks
and
all
the
concoctions
these
are
usually
very
refreshing
and
the
majority
of
them
contain
sufficient
nourishment
to
recommend
their
frequent
use
water
in
beverages
many
persons
restrict
the
term
beverages
contending
that
it
refers
to
refreshing
or
flavored
drinks
it
should
be
remembered
however
that
this
term
has
a
broader
meaning
and
refers
to
any
drink
taken
for
the
purpose
of
quenching
thirst
water
is
the
simplest
beverage
and
is
in
reality
the
foundation
of
nearly
all
drinks
for
it
is
the
water
in
them
that
slakes
thirst
flavors
such
as
fruit
juice
tea
coffee
are
combined
with
water
to
make
the
beverages
more
tempting
and
occasionally
such
foods
as
eggs
cream
and
starchy
materials
are
added
to
give
food
value
but
the
first
and
foremost
purpose
of
all
beverages
is
to
introduce
water
into
the
system
and
thus
satisfy
thirst
kinds
of
inasmuch
as
water
is
so
important
an
element
in
the
composition
of
beverages
every
one
should
endeavor
to
become
familiar
with
the
nature
of
each
of
its
varieties
soft
water
is
water
that
contains
very
little
mineral
matter
a
common
example
of
soft
water
is
rainwater
hard
water
is
water
that
contains
a
large
quantity
of
lime
in
solution
boiling
such
water
precipitates
or
separates
some
of
the
lime
and
consequently
softens
the
water
an
example
of
the
precipitation
of
lime
in
water
is
the
deposit
that
can
be
found
in
any
teakettle
that
has
been
used
for
some
time
mineral
water
is
water
containing
a
large
quantity
of
such
minerals
as
will
go
in
solution
in
water
namely
sulphur
iron
lime
etc
distilled
water
is
water
from
which
all
minerals
have
been
removed
to
accomplish
this
the
water
is
converted
into
steam
and
then
condensed
this
is
the
purest
form
of
water
carbonated
water
is
water
that
has
had
or
gas
forced
into
it
the
soda
water
used
at
soda
fountains
is
an
example
of
this
variety
carbonated
water
is
bottled
and
sold
for
various
purposes
necessity
for
pure
the
extensive
use
made
of
water
in
the
diet
makes
it
imperative
that
every
effort
be
exerted
to
have
the
water
supply
as
pure
as
possible
the
ordinary
city
filter
and
the
smaller
household
filter
can
be
depended
on
to
remove
sand
particles
of
leaves
weeds
and
such
foreign
material
as
is
likely
to
drop
into
the
water
from
time
to
time
but
they
will
not
remove
disease
germs
from
an
unclean
supply
therefore
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
water
being
pure
enough
to
use
for
drinking
purposes
it
should
be
boiled
before
it
is
used
boiling
kills
any
disease
germs
that
the
water
may
contain
but
at
the
same
time
it
gives
the
water
a
very
flat
taste
because
of
the
loss
of
air
in
boiling
however
as
is
mentioned
in
of
part
the
natural
taste
may
be
restored
by
beating
the
boiled
water
with
an
egg
beater
or
by
partly
filling
a
jar
placing
the
lid
on
and
shaking
it
vigorously
relation
of
beverages
to
meals
about
of
all
the
water
required
each
day
is
taken
in
the
form
of
beverages
with
the
meals
it
was
formerly
thought
that
liquids
dilute
the
gastric
juice
and
so
should
be
avoided
with
meals
however
it
has
been
learned
that
beverages
either
warm
or
cold
with
the
exception
of
an
occasional
case
may
be
taken
with
meals
without
injury
the
chief
point
to
remember
is
that
it
is
unwise
to
drink
beverages
either
too
hot
or
too
cold
for
the
best
results
their
temperature
should
be
rather
moderate
foods
that
may
be
dissolved
in
water
can
be
incorporated
in
a
beverage
to
make
it
nutritious
with
many
persons
as
in
the
case
of
small
children
and
invalids
this
is
often
the
only
means
there
is
of
giving
them
nourishment
in
serving
beverages
to
healthy
persons
the
food
value
of
the
meal
should
be
taken
into
consideration
the
beverage
accompanying
a
heavy
meal
should
be
one
having
very
little
food
value
whereas
in
the
case
of
a
light
meal
the
beverage
can
be
such
as
will
give
additional
nutrition
for
instance
hot
chocolate
which
is
very
nutritious
would
not
be
a
good
beverage
to
serve
with
a
meal
consisting
of
soup
meat
vegetables
salad
and
dessert
but
it
would
be
an
excellent
drink
to
serve
with
a
lunch
that
is
made
up
of
light
sandwiches
salad
and
fruit
alcoholic
beverages
alcoholic
beverages
are
made
by
allowing
yeast
to
ferment
the
starch
or
the
sugar
in
a
certain
kind
of
food
thus
producing
acid
and
alcohol
grains
and
fruits
are
used
oftenest
for
this
purpose
in
some
cases
the
fermentation
is
allowed
to
continue
long
enough
to
use
up
all
the
starch
or
sugar
in
the
material
selected
and
in
this
event
the
resulting
beverages
are
sour
and
contain
a
great
deal
of
alcohol
in
others
the
fermentation
is
stopped
before
all
the
sugar
or
starch
is
utilized
and
then
the
beverage
is
sweet
and
contains
less
alcohol
the
higher
the
percentage
of
alcohol
a
beverage
contains
the
more
intoxicating
it
is
and
the
more
quickly
will
a
state
of
intoxication
be
reached
by
drinking
it
harmful
effects
of
alcoholic
in
years
past
alcoholic
beverages
were
considered
to
be
a
necessity
for
medicinal
purposes
in
hospitals
and
in
homes
but
this
use
of
them
has
been
very
greatly
decreased
in
fact
it
is
believed
by
most
authorities
that
often
more
harm
than
good
is
done
by
using
alcoholic
beverages
as
a
medical
stimulant
or
as
a
carrier
for
some
drug
as
these
drinks
are
harmful
in
this
respect
so
are
they
detrimental
to
health
when
they
are
taken
merely
as
beverages
it
is
definitely
known
that
alcohol
acts
as
a
food
when
it
enters
the
body
for
it
is
burned
just
as
a
carbohydrate
would
be
and
thus
produces
heat
that
this
action
takes

many
of
them

following
are
the
names
of
these
together
with
a
short
account
of
their
preparation
beer
is
an
alcoholic
beverage
made
from
certain
grains
usually
barley
by
malting
the
grain
boiling
the
product
with
hops
and
finally
fermenting
it
with
yeast
the
malting
of
grains
it
will
be
remembered
is
explained
in
the
hops
are
used
to
give
the
beer
a
desirable
flavor
this
beverage
is
characterized
by
a
low
percentage
of
alcohol
containing
only
to
per
and
consequently
is
not
very
intoxicating
wine
is
a
beverage
that
is
usually
made
from
grapes
although
berries
and
other
small
fruits
are
occasionally
used
it
contains
from
to
per
cent
of
alcohol
and
is
therefore
more
intoxicating
than
beer
the
wines
in
which
all
of
the
sugar
is
fermented
are
known
as

those
in
which
not

brandy
is
an
alcoholic
liquor
distilled
from

it
is
very
intoxicating
for
it

the
percentage
of

upon
being
distilled
brandy
is
colorless
but
it
is
then
stored
in
charred
wooden
casks
from
which
it
takes
its
characteristic
color
gin
is
a
practically
colorless
liquor
distilled
from
various
grains
and
flavored
with
oil
of
juniper
or
some
other
flavoring
substance
such
as
anise
orange
peel
or
fennel
it
contains
from
to
per

of
alcohol
it
is
usually
stored
in
glass
bottles
which
do
not
impart
a
color
to
it
rum
is
an
alcoholic
beverage
made
by
fermenting
cane
sugar
molasses
cane
juice
or
the
scum
and
waste
from
sugar
refineries
and
then
distilling
the
product
it
contains
from
to
per
cent
of
alcohol
and
has
a
disagreeable
odor
when
it
is
distilled
this
odor
however
is
removed
by
storing
the
rum
in
wooden
receptacles
for
a
long
period
of
time
cordials
are
beverages
made
by
steeping
fruits
or
herbs
in
brandy
which
is
barred
from
the
united
states
because
it
contains
wormwood
a
very
injurious
substance
is
a
cordial
besides
being
extremely
intoxicating
it
overstimulates

an
alcoholic
beverage
obtained
by
distilling
fermented
grain
several
times
until
it
has
a

then
it
is
flavored
and

stimulating
beverages
nature
of
stimulating
beverages
stimulating
beverages
are
those
which
contain
a
drug
that
stimulates
the
nervous
and
the
circulatory
system
that
is
one
that
acts
on
the
nerves
and
the
circulation
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
them
active
and
alert
common
examples
of
these
beverages
are
coffee
tea
and
cocoa
or
chocolate
if
the
nerves
are
in
need
of
rest
it
is
dangerous
to
stimulate
them
with
such
beverages
for
as
the
nervous
system
indirectly
affects
all
the
organs
of
the
body
the
effects
of
this
stimulation
are
the
immediate
effect
of
the
stimulant
in
these
beverages
is
to
keep
the
drinker
awake
thus
causing
sleeplessness
or
temporary
insomnia
if
tea
and
coffee
are
used
habitually
and
excessively
headaches
dull
brains
and
many
nervous
troubles
are
liable
to
result
the
stimulant
that
is
found
in
the
leaves
of
tea
is
known
as
that
found
in
coffee
beans
and
that
found
in
cacao
beans
from
which
cocoa
and
chocolate
are
made
each
of
these
stimulants
is
extracted
by
the
hot
liquid
that
is
always
used
to
make
the
beverage
it
is
taken
up
by
the
liquid
so
quickly
that
the
method
used
to
prepare
the
beverage
makes
little
difference
as
to
the
amount
obtained
in
other
words
tea
made
by
pouring
water
through
the
leaves
will
contain
nearly
as
much
of
the
stimulant
as
tea
made
by
boiling
the
leaves
in
addition
to
the
stimulant
tea
and
coffee
contain
or
an
acid
that
is
also
obtained
from
the
bark
of
certain
trees
and
used
in
the
tanning
of
animal
hides
in
the
preparation
of
leather
tannin
is
not
taken
so
quickly
from
tea
and
coffee
by
the
hot
liquid
used
in
preparing
the
beverage
as
is
the
stimulant
so
that
the
longer
tea
leaves
and
coffee
grounds
remain
in
the
liquid
the
more
tannic
acid
will
be
drawn
out
this
fact
can
be
detected
by
the
bitter
flavor
and
the
puckery
feeling
in
the
mouth
after
drinking
tea
that
has
been
allowed
to
remain
on
the
leaves

on
the
grounds
tannic
acid
has
a
decidedly
bad
effect
on

a

chocolate

however
are

and
as
they
are
usually
made
with
milk

they
have
the
advantage
of
conveying

because
of
their
nature
tea

coffee
should
never

cocoa

chocolate
provide
enough
food
value
to
warrant
their
use
in
the
diet
of

but
they
should

history
and
production
coffee
is
the
seed
of
the
coffee
tree
which
in
its
wild
state
grows
to
a
height
of
feet
but
in
cultivation
is
kept
down
to
about
or
feet
for
convenience
in
gathering
the
fruit
coffee
originated
in
abyssinia
where
it
has
been
used
as
a
beverage
from
time
immemorial
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
it
found
its
way
into
arabia
where
it
was
used
by
the
religious
leaders
for
preventing
drowsiness
so
that
they
could
perform
religious
ceremonies
at
night
about
years
later
it
came
into
favor
in
turkey
but
it
was
not
until
the
middle
of
the
century
that
it
was
introduced
into
england
its
use
gradually
increased
among
common
people
after
much
controversy
as
to
whether
it
was
right
to
drink
it
or
not
it
is
now
extensively
grown
in
india
ceylon
java
the
west
indies
central
america
mexico
and
brazil
the
country
brazil
furnishes
about
per
cent
of
the
coffee
used
in
the
united
states
and
about
per
cent
of
the
world
supply
coffee
is
a
universal
drink
but
it
finds
more
favor
in
some
countries
than
others
the
hospitality
of
a
turkish
home
is
never
thought
to
be
complete
without
the
serving
of
coffee
to
its
guests
however
the
coffee
made
by
the
turks
is
not
pleasant
except
to
those
who
are
accustomed
to
drinking
it
as
prepared
in
turkey
and
the
east
a
small
amount
of
boiling
water
is
poured
over
the
coffee
which
is
powdered
and
mixed
with
sugar
and
the
resulting
beverage
which
is
very
thick
is
served
in
a
small
cup
without
cream
the
french
make
a
concoction
known
as
an
which
as
explained
in
of
part
is
a
combination
of
coffee
and
milk
these
two
ingredients
are
heated
separately
in
equal
proportions
and
then
mixed
before
serving
this
is
a
very
satisfactory
way
in
which
to
serve
coffee
if
cream
can
not
be
obtained
obtaining
the
coffee
the
seeds
of
the
coffee
tree
are
enclosed
in
pairs
with
their
flat
surfaces
toward
each
other
in
dark
berries
the
pulp
of
the
berry
is
softened
by
fermentation
and
then
removed
leaving
the
seeds
enclosed
in
a
husk
they
are
then
separated
from
the
husks
by
being
either
and
rolled
or
reduced
to
a
soft
mass
in
water
with
the
aid
of
a
pulping
machine
with
the
husks
removed
the
seeds
are
packed
into
coarse
cloth
bags
and
distributed
roasting
the
coffee
the
next
step
in
the
preparation
of
coffee
for
use
is
the
roasting
of
the
coffee
beans
after
being
separated
from
the
husks
the
beans
have
a
color
but
during
the
roasting
process
when
they
are
subjected
to
high
temperature
and
must
be
turned
constantly
to
prevent
uneven
roasting
they
turn
to
a
dark
brown
as
the
roasting
also
develops
the
flavor
it
must
be
done
carefully
some
persons
prefer
to
buy
unroasted
coffee
and
roast
it
at
home
in
an
oven
but
it
is
more
economical
to
purchase
coffee
already
roasted
in
addition
the
improved
methods
of
roasting
produce
coffee
of
a
better
flavor
for
they
accomplish
this
by
machinery
especially
devised
for
the
purpose
grinding
the
coffee
during
the
roasting
process
there
is
developed
an
aromatic
volatile
oil
called
to
which
the
flavor
of
the
coffee
is
due
this
oil
is
very
strong
but
upon
being
exposed
to
the
air
it
passes
off
and
thus
causes
a
loss
of
flavor
in
the
coffee
for
this
reason
roasted
coffee
should
be
kept
in
cans
boxes
or
jars
before
it
is
used
however
it
must
be
ground
the
grinding
of
the
coffee
beans
exposes
more
surface
and
hence
the
flavor
is
more
quickly
lost
from
ground
than
unground
coffee
because
of
this
fact
and
because
ground
coffee
can
be
adulterated
very
easily
it
is
not
wise
to
buy
coffee
already
ground
if
only
a
small
quantity
is
bought
at
a
time
and
it
can
be
used
up
at
once
the
grinding
may
be
done
by
the
grocer
but
even
in
such
a
case
the
better
plan
is
to
grind
it
immediately
before
using
it
the
method
by
which
the
coffee
is
to
be
prepared
for
drinking
will
determine
to
a
large
extent
the
way
in
which
the
coffee
beans
must
be
ground
when
coffee
is
to
be
made
by
a
method
in
which
the
grounds
are
not
left
in
the
water
for
any
length
of
time
the
beans
must
be
ground
very
fine
in
fact
pulverized
for
the
flavor
must
be
extracted
quickly
for
other
purposes
such
as
when
it
is
to
be
made
in
a
percolator
the
beans
need
not
be
ground
quite
so
fine
and
when
it
is
to
be
made
in
an
ordinary
coffee
pot
they
may
be
ground
very
coarse
for
use
in
the
home
simple
coffee
mills
that
will
grind
coffee
as
coarse
or
as
fine
as
may
be
desired

so

the

is
put
in
the
chamber
from
which
it
is
fed
to

adulteration
of
as
in
the
case
of
numerous
other
foods
attempts
are
often
made
to
adulterate
coffee
since
the
pure
food
laws
have
been
enforced
there
is
not
so
much
danger
of
adulteration
in
a
product
of
this
kind
still
every
housewife
should
be
familiar
with
the
ways
in
which
this
beverage
may
be
reduced
in
strength
or
quality
so
that
she
may
be
able
to
tell
whether
she
is
getting
a
good
or
an
inferior
product
for
her

coffee
may
be
adulterated
in
a
number
of
ways
ground
coffee
is
especially
easy
to
adulterate
with
bread
crumbs
bran
and
similar
materials
that
have
been
thoroughly
browned
many
of
the
cheaper
coffees
are
adulterated
with
chicory
a
root
that
has
a
flavor
similar
to
that
of
coffee
and
gives
the
beverages
with
which
it
is
used
a
color
chicory
is
not
harmful
in
fact
its
flavor
is
sought
by
some
people
particularly
the
french
the
objection
to
it
as
well
as
to
other
adulterants
is
that
it
is
much
cheaper
than
coffee
and
the
use
of
it
therefore
increases
the
profits
of
the
dealer
the
presence
of
chicory
in
coffee
can
be
detected
by
putting
a
small
amount
of
the
ground
coffee
in
a
glass
of
water
if
chicory
is
present
the
water
will
become
tinged
with
red
and
the
chicory
will
settle
to
the
bottom
more
quickly
than
the
coffee
preparation
of
coffee
selection
of
many
varieties
of
coffee
are
to
be
had
but
mocha
java
and
rio
are
the
ones
most
used
a
single
variety
however
is
seldom
sold
alone
because
a
much
better
flavor
can
be
obtained
from
by
which
is
meant
two
or
more
kinds
of
coffee
mixed
together
it
is
usually
advisable
to
buy
as
good
a
quality
of
coffee
as
can
be
afforded
the
more
expensive
coffees
have
better
flavor
and
greater
strength
than
the
cheaper
grades
and
consequently
need
not
be
used
in
such
great
quantity
it
is
far
better
to
serve
this
beverage
seldom
and
to
have
what
is
served
the
very
best
than
to
serve
it
so
often
that
a
cheap
grade
must
be
purchased
for
instance
some
persons
think
that
they
must
have
coffee
for
at
least
two
out
of
three
daily
meals
but
it
is
usually
sufficient
if
coffee
is
served
once
a
day
and
then
for
the
morning
or
midday
meal
rather
than
for
the
evening
meal
after
deciding
on
the
variety
of
coffee
that
is
desired
it
is
well
to
buy
unground
beans
that
are
packed
in
packages
upon
receiving
the
coffee
in
the

in

a
more
complicated
utensil
than
any
of
those
mentioned
is
used
for
the
making
of
coffee
the
directions
that
accompany
it
will
have
to
be
followed
but
no
matter
what
kind
of
utensil
is
selected
for
the
preparation
of
coffee
it
should
be
thoroughly
cleaned
each
time
it
is
used
to
clean
it
first
empty
any
coffee
it
contains
and
then
wash
every
part
carefully
and
scald
and
dry
it
if
the
utensil
is
not
clean
the
flavor
of
the
coffee

be
spoiled
methods
of
making
several
methods
are
followed
in
the
making
of
coffee
the
one
to
select
depending
on
the
result
desired
and
the
kind
of
utensil
to
be
used
the
most
common
of
these
methods
are
which
produces
a
decoction
or
which
consists
in
pouring
boiling
water
over
very
finely
ground
coffee
in
order
to
extract
its
properties
and
in
which
boiling
water
percolates
or
passes
through
finely
ground
coffee
and
extracts
its
flavor
for
any
of
these
methods
soft
water
is
better
than
water
that
contains
a
great
deal
of
lime
many
times
persons
can
not
understand
why
coffee
that
is
excellent
in
one
locality
is
poor
in
another
in
the
majority
of
cases
this
variation
is
due
to
the
difference
in
the
water
and
not
to
the
coffee
from
to
tablespoonfuls
of
coffee
to
cupful
of
water
is
the
usual
proportion
followed
in
making
coffee
boiled
without
doubt
coffee
is
more
often
boiled
in
its
preparation
than
treated
in
any
other
way
usually
an
ordinary
coffee
pot
is
all
that
is
required
in
this
method
of
preparation
the
amount
of
ground
coffee
used
may
be
varied
to
obtain
the
desired
strength
boiled
coffee
sufficient
to
serve
six
cold
water
ground
coffee
boiling
water
after
scalding
the
coffee
pot
put
cupful
of
the
cold
water
and
the
ground
coffee
into
it
stir
well
and
then
add
the
boiling
water
allow
it
to
come
to
the
boiling
point
and
boil
for
minutes
pour
a
little
of
the
coffee
into
a
cup
to
clear
the
spout
of
grounds
add
the
remaining
cupful
of
cold
water
and
put
back
on
the
stove
to
reheat
but
not
to
boil
when
hot
serve
at
once
never
allow
the
liquid
to
stand
on
the
grounds
for
any
length
of
time
for
the
longer
it
stands
the
more
tannic
acid
will
be
drawn
out
as
coffee
made
by
boiling
is
usually
somewhat
cloudy
it
may
be
cleared
in
one
way
or
another
the
last
cold
water
is
added
for
this
purpose
for
as
it
is
heavier
than
the
warm
liquid
it
sinks
to
the
bottom
and
carries
the
grounds
with
it
coffee
may
also
be
cleared
by
stirring
a
small
quantity
of
beaten
raw
egg
either
the
white
or
the
yolk
or
both
into
the
grounds
before
the
cold
water
is
added
to
them
one
egg
will
clear
two
or
three
potfuls
of
coffee
if
care
is
exercised
in
its
use
what
remains
of
the
egg
after
the
first
potful
has
been
cleared
should
be
placed
in
a
small
dish
and
set
away
for
future
use
a
little
cold
water
poured
over
it
will
assist
in
preserving
it
if
the
egg
shells
are
washed
before
the
egg
is
broken
they
may
be
crushed
and
added
to
the
grounds
also
for
they
will
help
to
clear
the
coffee
the
explanation
of
the
use
of
egg
for
this
purpose
is
that
it
coagulates
as
the
coffee
heats
and
carries
the
particles
of
coffee
down
with
it
as
it
sinks
another
very
satisfactory
way
in
which
to
make
boiled
coffee
is
to
tie
the
ground
coffee
loosely
into
a
piece
of
cheesecloth
pour
the
boiling
water
over
it
and
then
let
it
boil
for
a
few
minutes
longer
than
in
the
method
just
given
coffee
prepared
in
this
manner
will
be
found
to
be
clear
and
therefore
need
not
be
treated
in
any
of
the
ways
mentioned
filtered
when
it
is
desired
to
make
coffee
by
the
filtering
process
the
coffee
must
be
ground
into
powder
then
it
should
be
made
in
a
drip
or
french
coffee
pot
if
one
of
these
is
not
available
cheesecloth
of
several
thicknesses
may
be
substituted
the
advantage
of
making
coffee
by
this
method
is
that
the
coffee
grounds
may
sometimes
be
used
a
second
time
filtered
coffee
sufficient
to
serve
six
powdered
coffee
qt
boiling
water
place
the
coffee
in
the
top
of
the
drip
pot
pour
the
boiling
water
over
it
and
allow
the
water
to
drip
through
into
the
vessel
below
when
all
has
run
through
remove
the
water
and
pour
it
over
the
coffee
a
second
time
if
cheesecloth
is
to
be
used
put
the
coffee
in
it
suspend
it
over
the
coffee
pot
or
other
convenient
utensil
and
proceed
as
with
the
drip
pot
percolated
the
coffee
used
for
percolated
coffee
should
be
ground
finer
than
for
boiled
coffee
but
not
so
fine
as
for
filtered
coffee
this
is
perhaps
the
easiest
way
in
which
to
prepare
coffee
and
at
the
same
time

surest

of
securing

begins
before

the
more
rapidly

process
continues

the
aim
of

should
be
to
make
the
exact
quantity
needed
no
more

no

this
can
usually
be

history
and
production
tea
consists
of
the
prepared
leaves
or
leaf
buds
of
a
plant
known
as
the
tea
plant
and
is
used
as
one
of
the
three
stimulating
beverages
this
plant
is
grown
in
china
japan
india
ceylon
and
the
east
indies
and
to
a
small
extent
in
south
carolina
there
are
two
distinct
varieties
of
tea
and
each
one
may
be
used
for
the
preparation
of
either
green
or
black
tea
the
leaves
of
the
tea
plant
which
are
what
is
used
for
making
the
beverage
are
gathered
four
times
a
year
from
the
time
the
plants
are
years
old
until
they
are
or
years
old
then
the
plants
are
pulled
up
and
new
ones
planted
upon
being
gathered
the
leaves
are
put
through
a
series
of
processes
before
they
are
ready
for
use
during
this
treatment
various
modifications
of
flavor
are
developed
and
the
leaves
are
changed
in
color
to
black
or
green
depending
on
the
process
used
it
is
surprising
to
most
persons
to
learn
that
tea
was
known
in
china
for
many
years
before
people
began
to
make
a
beverage
of
it
the
first
record
of
its
use
as
a
beverage
was
probably
in
the
century
when
an
infusion
of
tea
leaves
was
given
to
a
ruler
of
the
chinese
empire
to
cure
a
headache
a
century
later
tea
had
come
into
common
use
as
a
beverage
in
that
country
as
civilization
advanced
and
new
countries
were
formed
tea
was
introduced
as
a
beverage
and
today
there
is
scarcely
a
locality
in
which
it
is
not
commonly
used
classification
of
tea
as
to
the
position
of

the
quality
of
the
tea
the
farther
from
the
top
the
coarser
are
the
leaves
and
the
poorer
is
the
quality
on
the
other
hand
the
smaller
the

and
the
nearer
the

the
better
is
the

of
the

are
included
with
the
tiny

tea
that
is
raised
in
china
is
graded
in
a
particular
way
and
it
will
be
well
to
understand
this
grading
the
top
buds
are
used
entirely
for
a
variety
known
as
but
this
is
seldom
found
in
our
markets
the
youngest
leaves
next
to
the
buds
are
made
into

next
older
leaves

the
third

it

raised
in

country
may
be
made

these
two
kinds

as
has
been
mentioned
it
is
the
method
of
preparation
that
is
accountable
for
the
difference

number
of
the
common
brands
of

are
blends
or
mixtures
of
green
and
black
tea
these
which
are
often
called
are
preferred
by
many
persons
to
the
pure
tea
of
either
kind
black
tea
is
made
by
fermenting
the
tea
leaves
before
they
are
dried
this
fermentation
turns
them
black
and
produces
a
marked
change
in
their
flavor
the
process
of
preparation
also

much
of

be
dissolved

flour

used
in
addition
to
the
usual
ingredients
while
this
is
accountable
for
the
creamy
consistency
of
the

it
should
be

very
good
hot

be
made
by
following
the
directions
here
given
as
will
be
noted
this
recipe
is
similar
to
several
of
those
given
for

except
that
chocolate
is
substituted
for
the

it
may
therefore
be
used
on

as
the
materials
used
in
the
preparation
of

are
rather
expensive
not
the
slightest
quantity
of
these
beverages
that
remains
after
serving
should
be
wasted
however
a
small
amount
of
chocolate
usually
has
to
be
added
so
that
it
will
have
a
stronger
flavor
it
may
then
be
thickened
with
corn
starch
for
chocolate

or
with
gelatine
for
chocolate

either
of

chocolate
bread

may
also
be
flavored
with
these
beverages
it
is
also
a
good
plan
to
utilize
cocoa
or
chocolate
for
flavoring
purposes
however
additional
cocoa
or
chocolate
and
sugar
should
first
be
added
to
it
and
the
mixture
should
then
be
boiled
to
a
sirup
when
so
prepared
it
may
be
used
whenever
a
chocolate

is
desired

cereal
beverages
beverages
are
those
which
contain
neither
stimulant
nor
alcohol
they
are
the
ones
usually
depended
on
to
carry
nutrition
into
the
body
and
to
provide
the
necessary
refreshment
in
this
class
of
beverages
come
the
various
cereal
beverages
fruit
drinks
soft
drinks
and
drinks
with
the
exception
of
the
cereal
beverages
these
drinks
are
of
a
very
refreshing
nature
for
they
are
served
as
cold
as
possible
and
they
contain
materials
that
make
them
very
pleasing
to
the
taste
most
of
them
can
be
prepared
in
the
home
at
much
less
cost
than
they
can
be
purchased
commercially
prepared
or
at
soda
fountains
so
it
is
well
for
the
housewife
to
be
familiar
with
their
nature
and
their
preparation
cereal
beverages
as
the
name
implies
are
made
from
cereals
of
these
the
are
perhaps
the
most
common
they
contain
nothing
that
is
harmful
and
are
slightly
beneficial
in
that
they
assist
in
giving
the
body
some
of
the
necessary
liquid
however
they
have
absolutely
no
food
value
and
are
therefore
of
no
importance
in
the
diet
except
to
take
the
place
of
stimulating
beverages
that
are
likely
to
injure
those
who
drink
them
they
are
made
of
cereals
to
which
sugar
or
molasses
is
added
and
the
whole
is
then
baked
until
the
cereals
brown
and
the
sugar
caramelizes
the
combination
producing
a
flavor
much
like
that
of
coffee
plain
roasted
wheat
or
bran
can
be
used
very
well
as
a
substitute
in
the
making
of
these
beverages
in
the
parts
of
the
country
where
rye
is
extensively
grown
it
is
roasted
in
the
oven
until
it
is
an
even
brown
in
color
it
is
then
used
almost
exclusively
by
some
persons
to
make
a
beverage
that
closely
resembles
coffee
in
flavor
the
cereal
are
made
by
drawing
all
the
flavor
possible
out
of
the
material
by
means
of
water
the
water
is
then
evaporated
and
the
hard
substance
that
remains
is
ground
until
it
is
almost
a
powder
when
water
is
added
again
this
substance
becomes
soluble
instantly
coffee
is
prepared
in
the
same
way
the
way
in
which
to
use
these
beverages
depends
of
course
on
the
kind
selected
but
no
difficulty
will
be
experienced
in
their
preparation
for
explicit
directions

always
found
in
or
on
all
packages

beverages
fruit
beverages
are
those
which
contain
fruit
and
fruit
juices
for
their
foundation
as
there
are
many
kinds
of
fruit
that
can
be
used
for
this
purpose
almost
endless
variety
can
be
obtained
in
the
making
of
these
beverages
one
of
the
important
features
is
that
a
great
deal
of
nourishment
can
be
incorporated
into
them
by
the
materials
used
in
addition
the
acids
of
fruits
are
slightly
antiseptic
and
are
stimulating
to
the
digestion
as
well
as
beneficial

the
blood
lemon
juice
when
mixed
with
other
fruit
juices
seems
to
intensify
the
flavor
because
of
this
fact
practically
all
the
recipes
for
fruit
beverages
include
this
juice
as
one
of
the
ingredients
the
combination
of
pineapple
and
lemon
yields
a
greater
quantity
of
flavor
for
beverages
ices
etc
than
any
other
two
fruit
flavors
juice
may
be
extracted
from
all
fruits
easily
to
obtain
lemon
juice
for
a
fruit
beverage
first
soften
the
fruit
by
pressing
it
between
the
hand
and
a
hard
surface
such
as
a
table
top
or
merely
soften
it
with
the
hands
then
cut
it
in
two
crosswise
and
drill
the
juice
out
as
shown
in
fig
by
placing
each
half
over
a
drill
made
of
glass
or
aluminum
and
turning
it
around
and
around
until
all
the
juice
is
extracted
to
remove
the
seeds
and
pulp
strain
the
juice
through
a
wire
strainer
the
juice
from
oranges
and
grapefruit
if
they
are
not
too
large
may
be
extracted
in
the
same
way
it
is
not
always
necessary
to
extract
juices
from
fresh
fruit
for
fruit
beverages
in
fact
juice
from
canned
fruit
or
juice
especially
canned
for
beverage
making
is
the
kind
most
frequently
employed
for
instance
in
the
canning
of
fruit
there
is
often
a
large
quantity
of
juice
left
over
that
most
persons
use
for
jelly
it
is
a
good
plan
to
can
this
juice
just
as
it
is
and
then
use
it
with
lemon
juice
or
other
fruit
juices
for
these
beverages
also
juices
that
remain
after
all
the
fruit
has
been
used
from
a
can
may
be
utilized
in
the
same
way
no
matter
what
the
kind
or
the
quantity
in
fact
unless
otherwise
stated
in
the
recipes
that
follow
the
fruit
juices
given
with
the
exception
of
orange
and
lemon
juice
are
those
taken
from
canned
fruit
or
juices
canned
especially
for
beverage
making
these
juices
also
lend
themselves
admirably
to
various
other
uses
for
as
has
already
been
learned
they
are
used
in
ices
gelatine
desserts
salad
dressing
pudding
sauces
etc
therefore
no
fruit

should
ever
be
wasted

soft
drinks
a
class
of
very
popular
beverages
are
the
soft
drinks
sold
at
the
soda
fountains
many
of
them
can
also
be
bought
in
bottles
and
so
may
be
purchased
and
served
at
home
these
drinks
really
consist
of
carbonated
water
and
a
flavoring
material
that
is
either
prepared
chemically
and
colored
or
made
of
fruit
extracts
sometimes
ice
cream
is
added
and
the
drink
is
then
called
soft
drinks
include
phosphates
ginger
ale
coca
cola
birch
beer
root
beer
and
various
other
drinks
called
mashes
sours
and
freezes
while
these
are
pleasing
to
the
taste
and
have
the
advantage
of
being
ready
to
drink
when
prepared
it
is
advisable
not
to
indulge
in
them
too
frequently
because
excessive
use
of
them
is
liable
to
affect
the
system
besides
beverages
that
are
just
as
satisfactory
as
these
so
far
as
flavor
is
concerned
and
that
are
made
of
much
better
material
can
be
prepared
at
home
at
far
less
cost
with
these
drinks
as
with
other
commercially
prepared
articles
of
food
the
cost
of
preparation
and
service
in
addition
to
the
cost
of
materials
must
be
paid
for
by
the
consumer
nourishing
beverages
many
times
it
is
necessary
or
desirable
to
administer
food
in
the
form
of
liquid
when
this
is
to
be
done
as
much
nourishment
as
possible
should
generally
be
incorporated
into
the
beverage
to
meet
such
a
need
the
following
recipes
are
presented
in
each
case
the
quantities
mentioned
make
a
drink
sufficient
for
only
one
person
so
that
if
more
than
one
are
to
be
served
the
amounts
should
be
multiplied
by
the
number
desired
the
food
materials
used
in
these
drinks
are
easily
digested
and
the
beverages
are
comparatively
high
in
food
value
at
most
soda
fountains
these
nourishing
drinks
are
offered
for
sale
so
that
if
one
does
not
desire
the
work
of
preparation
they
may
be
obtained
at
such
places
however
as
practically
all
the
ingredients
are
materials
used
in
the
home
and
are
therefore
nearly
always
on
hand
in
most
households
drinks
of
this
kind
may
be
prepared
at
home
at
much
less
cost
than
when
purchased
already
made
the
main
thing
to
remember
in
their
preparation
is
that
the
ingredients
should
be
as
cold
as
possible
and
that
the
beverage
should
be
cold
when
served
the
beverages
containing
eggs
may
be
made
in
more
than
one
way
they
may
be
mixed
in
a
bowl
or
an
enamelware
dish
with
a
rounded
bottom
and
then
beaten
with
a
rotary
egg
beater
or
they
may
be
mixed
in
a
metal
shaker
designed
especially
for
this
purpose
and
then
shaken
thoroughly
in
that
in
drinks
of
this
kind
the
point
to
remember
is
that
the
eggs
should
be
beaten
or
shaken
until
they
are
light
and
foamy
chocolate
while
chocolate
sirup
is
not
a
beverage
in
itself
it
is
used
to
such
an
extent
in
beverages
as
well
as
an
accompaniment
to
numerous
desserts
that
it
is
well
for
the
housewife
to
know
how
to
prepare
it
it
may
be
kept
an
indefinite
length
of
time
if
it
is
put
into
a
glass
jar
and
sealed
here
as
in
the
preparation
of

the
planning
of
meals
necessity
for
careful
meal
planning
as
every
housewife
realizes
the
feeding
of
the
members
of
her
family
places
upon
her
serious
and
important
responsibilities
while
she
deserves
and
receives
credit
for
their
good
health
the
blame
for
much
of
their
ill
health
falls
upon
her
too
the
reason
for
this
is
that
illness
is
due
in
a
greater
measure
to
wrong
food
than
to
any
other
single
factor
and
even
if
improper
diet
is
not
directly
responsible
for
ill
health
it
certainly
lowers
the
bodily
resistance
and
thus
makes
a
person
susceptible
to
disease
the
health
of
her
family
is
naturally
the
housewife
first
and
greatest
consideration
and
as
this
depends
so
much
on
correct
diet
it
should
be
the
aim
of
every
housewife
to
plan
her
meals
in
the
careful
intelligent
way
required
to
supply
her
household
with
the
food
each
member
needs
as
has
already
been
learned
a
knowledge
of
the
selection
care
and
preparation
of
food
is
absolutely
necessary
in
providing
proper
diet
but
correct
feeding
requires
more
than
this
in
addition
the
housewife
must
have
a
working
knowledge
of
what
foods
contain
and
their
effect
in
the
body
she
must
also
learn
what
her
family
needs
and
then
make
every
effort
to
supply
this
need
in
the
most
economical
way
the
result
will
be
a
sufficient
amount
of
food
of
the
right
kind
at
a
minimum
expenditure
of
funds
she
should
keep
in
mind
however
that
the
cost
of
diet
has
no
direct
relation
to
its
food
value
but
that
economy
and
proper
feeding
are
closely
connected
for
instance
an
inexpensive
diet
may
be
just
as
satisfactory
from
a
standpoint
as
an
expensive
one
but
in
order
to
make
the
inexpensive
one
adequate
and
the
expensive
one
balanced
the
housewife
must
apply
her
knowledge
of
the
general
composition
of
food
that
is
she
must
know
whether
a
food
predominates
in
carbohydrate
fat
or
protein
and
whether
or
not
it
furnishes
minerals
equipped
with
such
knowledge
she
will
be
able
to
purchase
the
largest
amount
of
nutritive
material
for
the
smallest
outlay
of
money
the
cheapest
food
is
not
always
the
one
that
sells
for
the
lowest
price
per
pound
quart
or
bushel
but
the
one
that
furnishes
the
most
nutritive
material
at
the
lowest
cost
also
food
that
is
the
wrong
kind
to
serve
is
not
an
economical
one
to
purchase
many
housewives
regard
it
as
unnecessary
to
plan
beforehand
and
persist
in
preparing
meals
without
giving
any
previous
thought
to
them
but
to
begin
thinking
about
an
hour
before
meal
time
what
to
have
for
a
meal
is
neither
wise
nor
economical
for
then
it
is
too
late
to
determine
what
ought
to
be
served
from
a
diet
standpoint
and
there
can
be
prepared
only
those
foods
which
the
time
will
allow
as
can
well
be
understood
this
is
both
a
disastrous
plan
for
correct
diet
and
a
very
extravagant
way
in
which
to
feed
a
family
quickly
broiled
steaks
and
chops
commercially
canned
vegetables
and
fruits
and
prepared
desserts
should
be
the
occasional
treat
rather
than
the
daily
food
instead
of
using
these
constantly
time
should
be
allowed
for
the
preparation
of
the
less
expensive
meats
and
vegetables
and
the
desserts
to
prepare
such
foods
successfully
requires
that
meals
should
be
planned
at
least
hours
before
they
are
to
be
served
and
in
reality
the
main
dishes
should
be
decided
on
hours
ahead
of
time
then
sometime
between
breakfast
and
luncheon
and
before
the
day
marketing
is
done
detailed
plans
should
be
made
for
luncheon
and
dinner
of
that
day
and
for
breakfast
of
the
next
nor
should
the
be
disregarded
if
economy
would
be
the
watchword
in
the
management
of
the
household
rather
they
should
be
included
in
the
plans
for
each
day
and
used
up
as
fast
as
possible
purchase
of
foods
successful
marketing
the
truly
economical
housewife
will
find
it
necessary
each
day
to
determine
three
things
what
is
left
from
yesterday
meals
and
what
use
can
be
made
of
it
what
is
in
supply
that
can
be
used
for
that
day
and
what
must
be
added
to
these
things
to
provide
satisfactory
meals
for
the
family
having
determined
these
points
she
should
make
a
list
of
the
articles
that
she
must
purchase
when
she
does
her
marketing
a
pad
fastened
to
the
kitchen
wall
and
a
pencil
on
a
string
attached
to
the
pad
are
convenient
for
this
purpose
at
the
same
time
they
serve
as
a
reminder
that
when
all
of
any
article
such
as
coffee
sugar
baking
powder
has
been
used
a
note
should
be
made
of
this
fact
to
her
list
of
supplies
that
have
become
exhausted
since
her
preceding
marketing
day
should
be
added
the
fresh
fruits
vegetables
and
other
perishable
foods
needed
for
the
next
day
or
preferably
for
the
next
two
days
if
they
can
be
kept
it
is
only
with
proper
preparation
that
the
housewife
may
expect
her
marketing
trips
to
be
successful
if
she
starts
to
market
with
merely
two
or
three
items
in
mind
and
then
tries
to
think
of
what
she
needs
as
she
orders
not
only
does
she
waste
the
grocer
time
but
her
marketing
trip
will
be
a
failure
after
she
arrives
home
she
will
find
that
there
are
other
things
she
should
have
purchased
and
the
grocer
will
be
forced
to
make
an
extra
delivery
to
bring
them
to
her
this
is
more
than
she
has
a
right
to
expect
for
the
grocer
should
not
be
obliged
to
pay
for
her
lack
of
planning
to
purchase
economically
it
is
advisable
when
possible
to
buy
at
a
cash
grocery
and
to
pay
cash
for
what
is
bought
when
this
is
done
one
is
not
helping
to
pay
the
grocer
for
accounts
he
is
unable
to
collect
it
is
a
fortunate
grocer
who
is
able
to
collect
per
cent
of
his
bills
from
his
patrons
when
he
conducts
his
business
on
the
credit
plan
however
if
it
is
desired
to
deal
with
a
credit
grocer
all
bills
should
be
paid
at
least
once
a
month
no
customer
has
a
right
to
expect
the
grocer
to
wait
longer
than
days
for
his
money
in
many
of
the
cities
and
large
towns
some
credit
grocers
have
adopted
what
is
called
the
plan
all
customers
whether
they
buy
for
cash
or
on
credit
must
pay
the
same
price
for
groceries
but
those
who
wish
their
goods
delivered
must
pay
additional
for
delivery
and
those
who
buy
on
credit
must
pay
a
certain
percentage
additional
on
each
purchase
for
bookkeeping
it
will
readily
be
seen
that
such
a
plan
gives
the
cash
customers
especially
if
they
carry
their
purchases
a
decided
advantage
over
credit
customers
also
the
grocer
is
better
able
to
sell
his
wares
at
a
lower
price
than
the
credit
grocer
who
makes
free
deliveries
and
no
charge
for
bookkeeping
keeping
household
accounts
necessity
for
keeping
practically
every
family
is
limited
to
a
definite
sum
of
money
that
may
be
spent
for
food
the
first
consideration
then
while
it
may
not
be
the
most
important
one
is
that
of
making
each
dollar
buy
all
that
it
possibly
can
in
order
that
the
income
may
meet
all
the
demands
upon
it
various
conditions
arise
that
affect
the
proportion
of
the
income
to
be
used
for
this
purpose
for
instance
two
women
whose
husbands
have
equal
incomes
would
under
the
same
conditions
have
an
equal
amount
of
money
to
spend
for
food
but
as
a
rule
there
is
something
to
cause
this
amount
to
become
unequal
one
woman
may
have
two
children
in
her
family
while
the
other
has
none
a
condition
that
means
of
course
that
the
woman
with
the
children
will
have
less
money
to
spend
for
food
and
with
that
money
she
must
feed
more
persons
her
family
must
be
if
possible
as
well
nourished
as
the
other
one
in
order
to
accomplish
this
task
it
will
be
necessary
to
supply
all
the
required
food
material
in
a
form
that
will
cost
less
than
the
food
purchased
by
the
woman
who
has
a
smaller
family
to
feed
and
clothe
an
excellent
way
in
which
to
keep
expenses
down
and
consequently
to
live
within
one
income
is
to
keep
a
simple
record
of
household
expenses
such
a
record
will
enable
every
housewife
to
determine
just
what
each
item
of
household
necessities
costs
and
whether
or
not
the
proportion
of
cost
to
income
is
correct
to
keep
a
record
of
expenditures
will
not
prove
much
of
a
task
if
it
is
done
systematically
for
a
few
minutes
a
day
will
be
sufficient
time
in
which
to
keep
accounts
up
to
date
however
if
account
keeping
is
attempted
it
should
not
be
neglected
even
for
a
day
for
it
will
soon
assume
the
proportions
of
a
large
task
and
will
have
a
tendency
to
discourage
the
housewife
with
this
part
of
her
work
equipment
for
household
account
for
convenience
in
keeping
household
accounts
a
small
desk
like
the
one
shown
in

if
possible
be
secured
and
placed
in
an
unoccupied

here
may
also
be
placed
an

which
by
being
so
convenient
will
save
the
housewife
many
steps
a
white
desk
with
a
chair
to
match
is
the
most
attractive
kind
to
select
for
kitchen
use
but
a
dark
one
may
be
used
if

the
desk

a
simple
wooden
one
that
was
enameled
white
after
it

it
is

to
buy
white

for
this
purpose
a
small
plain

of

answer
very
well

merely
makes

at

presents
his

she
may

she
has
to
devote
to

this

the

the
lines

to

all

represent

and
the
increase
in

due

is
indicated
by
the
black
spaces
which
increase
in
size
as
the
number
of
dealers
increase
the
may
be
the
manufacturer
but
in
most
cases
he
is
the
farmer
the
stockman
the
dairyman
or
the
fruit
grower
the
dealers
handling
the
food
between
the
producer
and
the
consumer
are
known
as
they
include
the
wholesaler
the
jobber
and
the
retailer
the
retailer
is
the
grocer
the
butcher
or
the
green
grocer
so
that
this
chart
may
be
clearly
understood
several
concrete
examples
are
given
thus
the
farmer
who
delivers
vegetables
directly
to
the
consumer
is
an
example
of
plan
no
he
has
very
little
overhead
expense
and
consequently
can
sell
cheaper
than
dealers
who
have
a
large
overhead
expense
however
when
the
farmer
delivers
his
vegetables
to
the
grocer
and
the
grocer
sells
them
to
the
consumer
an
example
of
plan
no
is
afforded
food
bought
in
this
way
costs
more
than
that
bought
directly
from
the
farmer
in
plan
no
the
farmer
for
instance
sells
his
vegetables
to
a
wholesaler
who
perhaps
buys
from
other
farmers
and
then
sells
small
quantities
of
them
to
the
grocer
for
sale
to
the
consumer
this
plan
as
will
readily
be
seen
is
more
involved
than
either
no
or
no
but
a
still
more
roundabout
route
is
that
of
plan
no
in
this
case
for
instance
the
farmer
sells
his
vegetables
to
a
canning
factory
where
they
are
canned
and
then
sold
to
the
grocer
who
sells
them
in
this
form
to
the
consumer
often
two
wholesalers
the
second
one
being
known
as
a
jobber
are
involved
in
the
transaction
as
in
plan
no
in
such
an
event
the
farmer
sells
to
the
wholesaler
who
sells
to
the
jobber
who
in
turn
sells
to
the
grocer
from
whom
the
consumer
secures
the
goods
the
most
complicated
route
is
that
shown
in
plan
no
this
illustrates
the
case
of
the
farmer
who
sells
his
cereal
products
to
a
manufacturer
who
makes
them
up
into
breakfast
foods
he
then
sells
them
in
large
quantities
to
the
wholesaler
who
sells
them
in
or
lots
to
the
jobber
from
the
jobber
they
go
to
the
grocer
who
delivers
them
to
the
consumer
from
a
study
of
this
chart
it
can
be
readily
seen
that
the
cost
of
food
may
be
reduced
if
the
middlemen
can
be
eliminated
for
instance
the
housewife
will
be
able
to
get
fruits
and
vegetables
cheaper
if
she
buys
them
from
a
farmer
instead
of
a
grocer
for
she
will
not
be
called
on
to
pay
any
of
the
grocer
overhead
expense
or
profit
again
if
she
buys
her
staple
groceries
in
a
store
that
is
able
to
eliminate
the
wholesaler
or
the
jobber
she
will
get
them
at
a
lower
price
than
if
she
deals
where
these
agencies
must
receive
their
share
of
the
profits
nationally
advertised
much
is
said
about
the
fact
that
the
consumer
in
buying
package
foods
that
are
nationally
advertised
must
pay
for
the
package
and
the
advertising
this
statement
is
absolutely
true
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
where
large
quantities
of
foods
are
handled
the
materials
can
be
bought
by
the
manufacturer
or
the
wholesaler
at
a
lower
price
than
by
one
who
purchases
only
a
small
amount
then
too
if
great
quantities
are
sold
and
this
condition
is
made
possible
only
through
advertising
the
profit
on
each
package
sold
can
be
much
smaller
than
that
which
would
have
to
be
made
when
less
is
sold
often
therefore
in
spite
of
the
advertising
cost
a
widely
advertised
food
can
be
sold
for
less
than
one
that
is
not
advertised
at
all
because
a
much
greater
quantity
is
sold
chain
the
principle
of
selling
great
quantities
of
food
at
a
comparatively
small
profit
on
each
item
is
put
into
practice
in
chain
stores
which
are
operated
by
different
companies
throughout
the
united
states
such
stores
are
a
boon
to
the
housewife
who
must
practice
economy
for
they
eliminate
a
middleman
by
acting
both
as
wholesaler
and
as
retailer
because
of
this
fact
foods
that
are
purchased
in
large
quantities
from
the
producer
or
manufacturer
can
be
offered
to
the
consumer
at
a
lower
price
than
in
a
retail
store
not
a
part
of
a
chain
therefore
if
foods
of
the
same
quality
are
not
lower
in
price
in
chain
stores
it
must
be
because
the
buying
is
not
well
done
or
a
greater
profit
is
made
in
selling
them
in
addition
chain
stores
generally
require
cash
for
all
purchases
made
in
them
and
they
do
not
usually
deliver
goods
consequently
their
overhead
expense
is
materially
reduced
and
they
do
not
need
to
make
such
a
large
profit
economical
buying
apportionment
of
when
the
housewife
thoroughly
understands
the
qualities
of
foods
as
well
as
their
comparative
food
values
and
is
familiar
with
the
factors
that
govern
food
prices
she
is
well

it
remains
for
her
to
purchase
the
right
kind
of
food
and
at
the

time
keep
within
her

a
good
plan
is
to
apportion
the
household
expenses
according
to
a
that
is
to
prepare
a
statement
of
the
financial
plans
for
the
year
then
the
amount
of
money
that
can
be
used
for
this
part
of
the
household
expenses
will
be
known
and
the
housewife
will
be
able
to
plan
definitely
on
what
she
can
buy
if
necessary
this
amount
may
be
reduced
through
the
housewife
giving
careful
attention
to
the
details
of
buying
or
if
she
is
not
obliged
to
lower
her
expenses
she
may
occasionally
purchase
more
expensive
foods
which
might
be
considered
luxuries
to
give
variety
to
the
diet
the
amount
of
money
that
may
be
spent
for
food
depends
of
course
on
the
income

the
greater
the

the

will
be
the
proportion
of

required
for
this

an

various

one

theoretically
the

should
adjust
this
difference
in
the

rather
than
increase
her
expenditures
for

if
in
a
certain
year
the
general
cost
of
food
is

cent
greater
than
it
was
in

the

should
adjust

of

so
that
for
the

amount
of
money
spent
in
the
previous

she
will
be
able
to
supply
her
family
with
what
they
need
of

if
there
is
an
increase
in
the
income
it
will
not
be
so
necessary
to
work
out
such
an
adjustment
economies
in
purchasing
through
her
study
of
the
preceding
lessons
the
student
has
had
an
opportunity
to
learn
how
to
care
for
food
in
order
to
avoid
loss
and
waste
how
to
prepare
it
so
that
it
may
be
easily
digested
and
assimilated
and
how
to
make
it
appetizing
and
attractive
so
that
as
little
as
possible
is
left
over
and
none
is
wasted
she
should
therefore
be
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
methods
of
procedure
in
regard
to
all
such
matters
and
should
have
worked
out
to
her
satisfaction
the
best
ways
of
accomplishing
these
things
to
suit
her
individual
needs
but
in
addition
to
these
matters
she
must
give
strict
attention
to
her
food
purchases
if
she
would
secure
for
her
family
the
most
wholesome
and
nourishing
foods
for
the
least
expenditure
of
money
to
purchase
food
that
will
provide
the
necessary
food
value
for
a
small
outlay
is
possible
to
a
certain
extent
but
it
can
not
be
done
without
the
required
knowledge
in
the
first
place
it
means
that
fewer
luxuries
can
be
indulged
in
and
that
the
family
dietary
will
have
to
be
reduced
to
necessities
it
may
also
mean
that
there
will
probably
be
a
difference
in
the
quality
of
the
food
purchased
for
instance
it
may
be
necessary
to
practice
such
economies
as
buying
broken
rice
at
a
few
cents
a
pound
less
than
whole
rice
or
purchasing
smaller
prunes
with
a
greater
number
to
the
pound
at
a
lower
price
than
the
larger
more
desirable
ones
the
housewife
need
not
hesitate
in
the
least
to
adopt
such
economies
as
these
for
they
are
undoubtedly
the
easiest
ways
in
which
to
reduce
the
food
expenses
without
causing
detriment
to
any
one
further
economy
can
be
practiced
if
a
little
extra
attention
is
given
in
the
purchase
of
certain
foods
as
is
well
known
the
packages
and
cans
containing
food
are
labeled
with
the
contents
and
the
weight
of
the
contents
these
should
be
carefully
observed
as
should
also
the
number
of
servings
that
may
be
obtained
from
the
package
or
can
for
instance
the
housewife
should
know
the
weight
per
package
of
the
various
kinds
of
prepared
cereals
she
uses
and
the
number
of
servings
she
is
able
to
procure
from
each
package
let
it
be
assumed
that
she
buys
two
packages
of
different
cereals
at
the
same
time
which
for
convenience
may
be
called
package
no
and
package
no
she
finds
that
no
contains
ounces
and
no
only
ounces
so
she
knows
that
no
furnishes
the
greater
amount
of
food
by
weight
for
the
money
spent
but
on
the
other
hand
no
may
go
farther
that
is
it
may
serve
a
greater
number
of
persons
this
in
all
probability
means
that
the
cereals
are
similar
in
character
but
that
the
food
value
of
the
servings
from
no
is
greater
than
that
of
the
servings
from
no
no
is
therefore
the
more
economical
of
the
two
matters
of
this
kind
must
not
be
overlooked
especially
in
the
feeding
of
children
then
too
the
housewife
should
work
out
carefully
which
she
can
use
to
greater
advantage
prepared
or
unprepared
cereals
if
she
finds
that
unprepared
cereals
are
the
more
economical
and
if
she
can
depend
on
their
food
value
as
being
as
high
as
that
of
the
prepared
ones
she
should
by
all
means
give
them
the
preference
of
course
she
may
use
prepared
cereals
for
convenience
or
for
varying
the
diet
but
the
more
economical
ones
should
be
used
with
greater
regularity
canned
goods
should
be
carefully
observed
a
certain
brand
of
tomatoes
for
instance
may
have
ounces
to
the
can
whereas
another
brand
that
can
be
bought
for
the
same
price
may
have
ounces
there
may
be
however
and
there
probably
is
a
great
difference
in
the
quality
of
the
tomatoes
the
can
may
have
a
much
greater
proportion
of
water
than
the
can
and
for
this
reason
will
not
serve
to
the
same
advantage
as
it
is
with
canned
tomatoes
so
is
it
with
canned
corn
peas
and
other
canned
vegetables
for
the
price
depends
altogether
on
the
quality
therefore
several
brands
should
be
compared
and
the
one
should
be
purchased
which
seems
to
furnish
the
most
food
or
the
best
quality
of
food
for
the
least
money
provided
the
quality
continues
in
the
preparation
of
meat
there
is
always
some
waste
and
as
waste
is
a
factor
that
has
much
to
do
with
the
increasing
of
costs
it
should
be
taken
into
consideration
each
time
a
piece
of
meat
is
purchased
if
there
is
time
for
some
experimenting
it
makes
an
interesting
study
to
weigh
the
meat
before
and
after
preparation
for
then
the
amount
of
shrinkage
in
cookery
as
well
as
the
waste
in
bone
skin
and
other
inedible
material
can
be
determined
an
actual
experiment
made
with
a
chicken
showed
that
there
was
a
loss
of
pounds
that
is
the
weight
of
the
edible
meat
after
deducting
the
waste
was
only
pounds
the
following
shows
how
this
weight
was
determined

of
chicken
including
head
feet
and
entrails

of
head

and
entrails

of
bones
after

of
skin
after
cooking
shrinkage
in
cooking
total
amount
of
waste
actual
weight
of
edible
meat
it
will
readily
be
seen
that
chicken
at
cents
a
pound
would
make
the
cost
per
pound
of
edible
meat
amount
to
exactly
a
rather
startling
result
it
is
true
of
course
that
the
busy
housewife
with
a
family
can
hardly
spare
the
time
for
the
extra
labor
such
experiments
require
still
the
greater
the
number
of
persons
to
be
fed
the
more
essential
is
the
need
for
economy
and
the
greater
are
the
possibilities
for
waste
and
loss
the
home
production
of
foods
does
not
belong
strictly
to
economical
buying
still
it
is
a
matter
that
offers
so
many
advantages
to
the
economical
housewife
that
she
can
not
afford
to
overlook
it
a
small
garden
carefully
prepared
and
well
cultivated
will
often
produce
the
summer
supply
of
fresh
vegetables
with
sufficient
overproduction
to
permit
much
to
be
canned
for
winter
not
only
do
foods
produced
in
a
home
garden
keep
down
the
cost
of
both
summer
and
winter
foods
but
they
add
considerably
to
the
variety
of
menus
correct
diet
suitability
of
food
at
the
same
time
the
housewife
is
making
a
study
of
economy
and
trying
to
procure
as
nearly
as
possible
the
best
quality
and
the
largest
quantity
of
food
for
the
amount
of
money
she
has
to
spend
she
must
consider
the
suitability
of
this
food
for
the
persons
to
whom
it
is
to
be
served
this
matter
is
undoubtedly
of
greater
importance
than
economy
for
regardless
of
the
amount
of
money
that
is
to
be
spent
suitable
foods
for
the
nourishment
of
all
the
members
of
the
family
must
be
supplied
to
them
for
instance
a
family
of
two
may
have
a
week
to
spend
for
food
whereas
one
of
five
may
perhaps
have
no
more
but
the
larger
family
must
have
nourishing
food
just
as
the
one
of
two
must
have
therefore
whether
the
housewife
has
much
or
little
to
spend
her
money
must
purchase
food
suited
to
the
needs
of
her
family
unless
she
is
able
to
accomplish
this
she
fails
in
the
most
important
part
of
her
work
as
a
housewife
and
as
a
result
the
members
of
her
family
are
not
properly
nourished
it
has
long
been
an
established
fact
that
correct
diet
is
the
greatest
factor
in
maintaining
bodily
health
food
is
responsible
for
the
growth
and
maintenance
of
the
body
tissues
as
well
as
for
their
repair
in
addition
it
supplies
the
body
with
heat
and
energy
consequently
taking
the
right
food
into
the
body
assists
in
keeping
a
person
in
a
healthy
condition
and
makes
work
and
exercise
possible
because
so
much
depends
on
the
diet
the
housewife
while
considering
what
can
be
bought
with
the
money
she
has
to
spend
must
also
decide
whether
the
foods
she
plans
to
buy
are
suitable
for
the
needs
of
her
family
in
fact
she
should
be
so
certain
of
this
matter
that
she
will
automatically
plan
her
menus
in
such
a
way
that
they
will
contain
all
that
is
necessary
for
each
person
to
be
fed
but
as
every
housewife
knows
the
appetites
of
her
family
must
also
be
taken
into
consideration
theoretically
she
should
feed
her
family
what
the
various
members
need
regardless
of
their
likes
and
dislikes
however
very
few
persons
are
willing
to
be
fed
in
this
way
in
truth
it
would
be
quite
useless
to
serve
a
dish
for
which
no
one
in
the
family
cared
and
in
addition
it
would
be
one
of
the
sources
of
waste
to
make
the
work
of
the
housewife
less
difficult
children
should
be
taught
as
far
as
possible
to
eat
all
kinds
of
food
too
often
this
matter
is
disregarded
and
too
often
also
are
the
kinds
of
food
presented
to
a
family
regulated
by
the
likes
and
dislikes
of
the
person
preparing
the
food
because
she
is
not
fond
of
certain
foods
she
never
prepares
them
consequently
the
children
do
not
learn
to
like
them
on
the
other
hand
many
children
develop
a
habit
of
complaining
about
foods
that
are
served
and
often
refuse
to
eat
what
is
set
before
them
such
a
state
of
affairs
should
not
be
permitted
indeed
every
effort
should
be
made
to
prevent
a
spirit
of
complaint
if
the
housewife
is
certain
that
she
is
providing
the
members
of
her
family
with
the
best
that
she
can
purchase
with
the
money
she
has
to
spend
and
that
she
is
giving
them
what
they
need
complaining
on
their
part
should
be
discouraged
with
a
little
effort
children
can
be
taught
to
like
a
large
variety
of
foods
especially
if
these
foods
are
given
to
them
while
they
are
still
young
it
is
a
decided
advantage
for
every
one
to
form
a
liking
for
a
large
number
of
foods
the
person
who
can
say
that
he
cares
for
everything
in
the
way
of
food
is
indeed
fortunate
for
he
has
a
great
variety
from
which
to
choose
and
is
not
so
likely
to
have
served
to
him
a
meal
in
which
there
are
one
or
more
dishes
that
he
can
not
eat
because
of
a
distaste
for
them
every
mother
should
therefore
train
her
children
during
their
childhood
to
care
for
all
the
cereals
vegetables
and
fruits
besides
affording
the
children
a
diet
these
foods
particularly
vegetables
and
fruits
when
served
in
their
season
offer
the
housewife
a
means
of
planning
economical
menus
for
as
every
one
knows
their
price
is
then
much
lower
than
at
any
other
time
and
is
less
than
that
of
most
other
foods
during
the
winter
turnips
carrots
onions
and
other
winter
vegetables
are
more
economical
foods
than
summer
vegetables
that
must
be
canned
or
otherwise
prepared
to
preserve
them
for
winter
use
or
the
fresh
summer
vegetables
purchased
out
of

however
it
is
advisable
to
vary
the
diet
occasionally
with
such

composition

to
feed

properly
the
housewife
should
understand
that
the
daily
food
must
include
the
five
food
substances
protein
fat
carbohydrate
mineral
matter
and
water
as
these
are
discussed
in
of
part
they
should
be
clear
to
the
housewife
but
if
they
are
not
fully
understood
a
careful
review
should
be
made
of
the
discussions
given
there
the
ways
in
which
these
food
principles
contribute
to
the
growth
and
health
of
the
body
as
well
as
the
ordinary
foods
that
supply
them
in
the
greatest
number
are
tabulated
in

ii
for
easy
reference
this
information
will
assist
the
housewife
materially
in
the
selection
and
preparation
of
food
for
her
family
consequently
close
attention
should
be
given
to
it
and
constant
application
made
of
it
as
has
already
been
learned
and
as
will
be
noted
here
a
food
substance
often
has
more
than
one
use
in
the
body
for
instance
protein
builds
tissue
and
also
yields
energy
but
its
chief
work
is
that
of
building
tissue
and
so
it
is
classed
first
as
a
food
substance
the
fats
and
carbohydrates
also
have
a
double
use
in
the
body
that
of
producing
heat
and
energy
and
of
building
fatty
tissue
however
as
their
chief
use
is
to
produce
heat
and
energy
they
are
known
principally
as
foods
mineral
matter
not
only
is
necessary
for
the
building
of

but
also
enters
into
the
composition
of
the
blood
and
all
the
fluids
in
the
body
growth
and
development
are
not
ideal
without
an
adequate
supply
of
the
many
kinds
of
these
salts
which
go
to
make
up
the
tissues

blood
and
other
fluids
in
the
body
the
body
regulators
must
be
included
in
the
food
given
for
they
assist
in
all
processes
carried
on
in
the
body
some
are
necessary
to
aid
in
the
stimulation
required
to
carry
on
the
processes
of
digestion
and
in
some
cases
make
up
a
part
of

consequently
vegetables

essential
to

the

too
much
the

cellulose
of

vegetables
and
cereals
is
of
such
importance
in
the
body
that
some
of
these
foods
should
be
supplied
with
every
meal
therefore
their
incorporation
into
the
diet
should
be
considered
as
a
definite
part
of
the
plan
the
acids
of

are
valuable
as

both
to

to

then
too
they
give

and
should
receive
the
preference
are
substances
necessary
for
both
growth
and
health
a
child
deprived
of
the
foods
containing
them
is
usually
not
well
and
does
not
grow
nor
develop
normally
these
substances
are
also
required
in
the
diet
of
adults
in
order
to
maintain
the
body
in
a
healthy
condition
the
leafy
vegetables
and
milk
are
the
foods
that
yield
the
greatest
supply
of
vitamines
in
fact
it
is
claimed
by
those
who
have
experimented
most
with
this
matter
that
these
two
sources
will
supply
the
required
amount
of
vitamines
under
all
conditions
balancing
the
diet
quantity
and
proportion
of
foods
factors
influencing
numerous
factors
affect
the
kind
and
quantity
of
food
necessary
for
an
individual
chief
among
these
are
age
size
sex
climate
and
work
or
exercise
in
addition
to
determining
the
amount
of
food
that
must
be
taken
into
the
body
these
factors
regulate
largely
the
suitability
of
the
foods
to
be
eaten
it
is
true
of
course
that
all
the
food
substances
mentioned
in
table
ii
must
be
included
in
every
person
diet
after
the
first
few
years
of
his
life
but
the
quantity
and
the
proportion
of
the
various
substances
given
vary
with
the
age
sex
size
and
work
or
exercise
of
the
person
and
the
climate
in
which
he
lives
merely
to
provide
dishes
that
supply
sufficient
food
value
is
not
enough
this
food
material
must
be
given
in
forms
that
can
be
properly
digested
and
assimilated
and
it
must
be
in
the
right
proportion
for
the
person
needs
the
aim
should
therefore
be
to
provide
a
by
which
is
meant
one
that
includes
the
correct
proportion
of
the
various
food
substances
to
supply
the
needs
of
the
individual
quantity
of
food
in
without
doubt
the
most
intelligent
way
in
which
to
feed
people
is
to
compute
the
number
of
calories
required
daily
as
will
be
remembered
the
calorie
is
the
unit
employed
to
measure
the
amount
of
work
that
the
food
does
in
the
body
either
as
a
tissue
builder
or
a
producer
of
energy
the
composition
and
food
value
of
practically
all
foods
are
fairly
well
known
and
with
this
information
it
is
a
simple
matter
to
tell
fairly
accurately
the
amount
of
food
that
each
person
requires
as
has
been
stated
the
number
of
calories
per
day
required
by
a
person
varies
with
the
age
size
sex
and
occupation
of
the
person
as
well
as
with
the
climate
in
which
he
lives
for
the
adult
this
will
vary
from
to
except
in
cases
of
extremely
hard
labor
when
it
may
be
necessary
to
have
as
high
as
calories
the
average
number
of
calories
for
the
adult
without
taking
into
consideration
the
particular
conditions
under
which
he
lives
or
works
is
about
still
a
small
woman
who
is
inactive
might
be
sufficiently
fed
by
taking
calories
a
day
whereas
a
large
man
doing
heavy
muscular
work
might
require
to
daily
importance
of
proper
amount
of
most
authorities
agree
that
it
is
advisable
for
adults
and
children
well
past
the
age
of
infancy
to
take
all
the
food
required
in
three
meals
the
taking
of
two
meals
a
day
is
sometimes
advocated
but
the
possibility
of
securing
in
two
meals
the
same
quantity
of
food
that
would
ordinarily
be
taken
in
three
is
rather
doubtful
since
it
is
assumed
that
large
amounts
of
food
are
not
so
easily
disposed
of
as
are
smaller
ones
on
the
other
hand
to
overeat
is
always
a
disadvantage
in
more
respects
than
one
taking
food
that
is
not
required
not
only
is
an
extravagance
in
the
matter
of
food
but
overtaxes
the
digestive
organs
in
addition
it
supplies
the
body
with
material
that
must
be
disposed
of
so
that
extra
work
on
the
part
of
certain
organs
is
required
for
this
activity
finally
overeating
results
in
the
development
of
excessive
fatty
tissue
which
not
only
makes
the
body
ponderous
and
inactive
but
also
deadens
the
quickness
of
the
mind
and
often
predisposes
a
person
to
disease
or
in
extreme
cases
is
the
actual
cause
of
illness
effect
of
weight
on
an
idea
of
the
way
in
which
the
weight
of
a
person
affects
the
amount
of
food
required
can
be
obtained
by
a
study
of
tables
iii
and
iv
as
will
be
observed
table

gives
the
number
of
calories

only
with

the
various
factors
that
might
alter
the
amounts
given

taken
up
later
the
figures
given
are
for
adults
and
the
factors
mentioned
are
those
which
affect
the
intake
of
food
to
the
greatest
extent
the
lowest
food
requirement
during
the
entire
hours
is
during
the
time
of
sleep
when
there
is
no
activity
and
food
is
required
for
only
the
bodily
functions
that
go
on
during
sleep
sitting
requires
more
food
than
sleeping
standing
a
still
greater
amount
and
walking
still
more
because
of
the
increase
in
energy
needed
for
these
activities
in
a
rough
way
the
various
occupations
for
both
men
and
women
are
classified
under
three
different
heads
light
work
moderate
work
and
heavy
work
it
is
necessary
that
these
be

effect
of

on
the

in

does
not
affect
the
diet
to
any
great
extent
authorities
claim
that
persons
of
opposite
sex
but
of
the
same
weight
and
engaged
in
the
same
work
require
equal
quantities
of
food
but
in
most
cases
the
work
of
women
is
lighter
than
that
of
men
and
even
when
this
is
not
the
case
women
seem
to
require
less
food
probably
because
of
a
difference
in
temperament
that
taken
by
women
is
usually
computed
to
be
about
of
the
amount
necessary
for
a
man
the
proportion
of
food
substances
does
not
differ
however
and
when
individual
peculiarities
are
taken
into
consideration
no
definite
rules
can
be
made
concerning
it
in
the
case
of
boys
and
girls
up
to
the
age
of
young
manhood
and
womanhood
the
same
amount
of
food
is
required

for
the
difference

usually
being
more
active

effect
of
climate
on
the
climate
in
which
a
person
lives
has
much
to
do
with
the
kind
of
diet
he
requires
in
the
extreme
north
the
lack
of
vegetation
makes
it
necessary
for
the
inhabitants
to
live
almost
entirely
upon
animal
food
except
during
the
very
short
warm
season
consequently
their
diet
consists
largely
of
protein
and
fat
under
some
circumstances
a
diet
of
this
kind
would
be
very
unfavorable
but
it
seems
to
be
correct
for
the
people
who
live
in
these
regions
for
generations
of
them
have
accustomed
themselves
to
it
and
they
have
suffered
no
hardship
by
doing
so
it
is
true
however
that
races
of
people
who
do
not
live
on
a
diet
are
not
physically
such
fine
specimens
as
the
majority
of
persons
found
in
countries
where
it
is
possible
to
obtain
a
diet
that
includes
a
sufficient
supply
of
all
the
food
substances
in
hot
countries
the
diet
consists
much
more
largely
of
vegetables
than
any
other
class
of
foods
this
means
that
it
is
very
high
in
carbohydrate
and
comparatively
low
in
protein
and
fat
as
can
well
be
understood
a
diet
of
this
kind
is
much
more
ideal
for
a
warm
climate
than
a
diet
composed
to
a
great
extent
of
animal
foods
in
temperate
zones
the
diet
for
both
summer
and
winter
seasons
varies
according
to
the
appetite
of
the
inhabitants
themselves
usually
a
light
diet
consisting
of
fruits
vegetables
cereals
and
a
small
amount
of
meat
is
found
the
most
desirable
for
summer
weather
while
a
similar
one
with
a
larger
proportion
of
meat
is
the
usual
winter
diet
on
the
whole
the
desire
for
food
which
to
a
certain
extent
is
regulated
by
the
climate
can
be
trusted
to
vary
the
diet
fairly
well
for
the
existing
conditions
effect
of
age
on
the
proper
diet
for
infancy
and
childhood
is
a
matter
that
must
be
discussed
by
itself
for
it
has
practically
no
connection
with
other
diet
it
is
also
well
understood
that
up
to
maturity
there
is
a
difference
in
the
diet
because
of
a
difference
in
the
needs
of
the
body
however
from
maturity
up
to
years
of
age
the
diet
is
altered
by
the
conditions
already
mentioned
namely
weight
size
sex
climate
and
work
or
exercise
at
the
age
of
the
amount
of
food
required
begins
to
decrease
for
as
a
person
grows
older
the
body
and
all
of
its
organs
become
less
active
then
too
there
is
a
reduced
amount
of
physical
exercise
which
correspondingly
reduces
the
necessity
for
food
at
this
time
an
oversupply
of
food
merely
serves
to
overwork
the
organs
which
being
scarcely
able
to
handle
the
normal
quantity
of
food
certainly
keep
in
better
condition
if
the
amount
of
work
they
are
called
upon
to
do
is
decreased
rather
than
increased
it
has
been
estimated
that
persons
years
of
age
require
per
cent
less
food
than
they
formerly
did
those
years
old
per
cent
less
and
those
years
old
per
cent
less
usually
the
appetite
regulates
this
decrease
in
food
for
the
less
active
a
person
is
the
less
likely
is
the
appetite
to
be
stimulated
however
the
fact
that
there
is
also
a
great
difference
in
persons
must
not
be
lost
sight
of
some
men
and
women
at
years
of
age
are
as
young
and
just
as
active
as
others
at
years
for
such
persons
the
decrease
in
quantity
of
food
should
not
begin
so
soon
nor
should
it
be
so
great
as
that
given
for
the
more
usual
cases
as
there
is
a
decrease
in
quantity
with
advancing
years
so
should
there
be
a
difference
in
the
quality
of
the
food
taken
that
which
is
easily
digested
and
assimilated
is
preferable
to
food
that
is
rich
or
highly
concentrated
usually
it
is
necessary
to
increase
the
laxative
food
in
the
diet
at
this
time
of
life
but
this
matter
is
one
of
the
abnormalities
of
diet
and
therefore
belongs
properly
to
medical
dietetics
rather
than
to
a
lesson
on
normal
diet
diet
for
infants
and
children
from
birth
until
a
child
has
attained
full
growth
the
food
requirement
is
high
in
proportion
to
the
size
of
the
child
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
energy
must
be
supplied
for
a
great
deal
of
activity
and
at
the
same
time
new
tissue
must
be
manufactured
from
the
food
taken
it
should
be
remembered
too
that
all
body
processes
during
growth
are
extremely
rapid
at
birth
the
average
child
weighs
about
pounds
and
for
several
days
after
birth
there
is
a
normal
loss
of
weight
in
a
few
days
however
if
the
diet
is
correct
the
child
begins
to
increase
in
weight
and
should
gain
about
pound
a
week
until
it
is
months
old
from
this
time
on
its
weekly
gain
should
be
slightly
less
but
it
should
be
constant
if
the
weight
remains
the
same
or
there
is
a
decrease
for
a
number
of
consecutive
days
or
weeks
it
is
certain
that
the
diet
is
incorrect
that
the
quantity
of
food
is
insufficient
or
that
the
child
is

small

half
of

tender
meat
chopped
very
fine
may
be

and
for

should
be
taken
out

at

should
be

that

bread
or
toast
softened
with
milk
eggs

with
caution
and
in
small
amounts
and
if
it
appears
to
disagree
with
the

in
any
way
it
should
be
discontinued
until

in
case
a

the

together
with

for
this

when
any

added
to

much
care
is
necessary
each

food
should
be
given
cautiously
a
teaspoonful
or
two
at
a

being
sufficient
at
first
and
its
effect
should
be
carefully
observed
before
more
is
given
if
it
is
found
to
disagree
it
should
not
be
repeated
if
at
any
time
a
child
is
subject
to
an
attack
of
indigestion
its
diet
should
be
reduced
to
simple
foods
and
when
it
has
recovered
new
foods
should
be
added
slowly
again
in
the
case
of
any
of
the
ordinary
illnesses
to
which
children
are
subject
such
as
colds
the
diet
should
be
restricted
to
very
simple
food
and
preferably
to
liquids
until
the
illness
has
passed
the
diet
of
a
baby
still
being

may
be
gradually
brought

its
normal
diet
diet
for
the
family
one
of
the
difficulties
of
every
housewife
having
a
family
composed
of
persons
of
widely
different
tastes
and
ages
is
the
preparation
of
meals
that
will
contain
sufficient
food
of
the
correct
kind
for
all
of
them
children
up
to
years
of
age
usually
require
something
especially
prepared
for
their
meals
except
breakfast
but
as
a
rule
the
selection
of
the
diet
for
children
from
years
up
to
or
years
of
age
is
merely
a
matter
of
taking
from
the
meal
prepared
for
the
remainder
of
the
family
the
right
amount
of
the
various
foods
tea
and
coffee
should
not
be
included
in
the
diet
of
growing
children
and
should
under
no
circumstances
be
given
to
small
children
if
the
proper
method
is
followed
in
this
matter
no
difficulty
will
result
but
where
children
expect
to
eat
the
food
served
to
the
others
at
the
table
and
are
not
content
with
what
is
given
to
them
it
is
better
not
to
feed
them
at
the
same
table
with
the
adults
the
most
satisfactory
way
in
which
to
arrange
meals
that
are
to
be
served
to
persons
of
different
ages
is
to
include
several
foods
that
may
be
fed
to
all
members
of
the
family
and
then
to
select
certain
others
proper
only
for
adults
and
still
others
suitable
for
the
children
a
sample
of
such
a
menu
for
supper
is
the
one
here
given
it
is
assumed
that
the
children
that
are
to
eat
this
meal
are
not
infants

lettuce
salad

children

milk
a
menu
of
this
kind
is
not
difficult
to
prepare
and
still
it
meets
the
needs
of
both
the
children
and
the
adults
of
the
family
the
main
dish
for
each
has
the
same
foundation
rice
enough
to
serve
the
entire
family
may
be
steamed
then
some
may
be
retained
for
the
children
and
the
rest
made
up
into
croquettes
and
served
with
cheese
sauce
to
the
adults
the
remainder
of
the
menu
bread
butter
jelly
baked
apples
and
plain
cookies
may
be
eaten
by
every
one
tea
will
probably
be
preferred
by
the
adults
but
milk
should
be
served
to
the
children
other
suitable
menus
may
be
planned
without
any
extra
trouble
if
just
a
little
thought
is
given
to
the
matter
proportion
of
food
substances
the
proportion
of
food
substances
necessary
for
building
and
repairing
the
body
and
for
providing
it
with
material
necessary
for
its
various
functions
is
a
matter
to
which
much
discussion
has
been
given
formerly
it
was
not
understood
that
the
protein
should
be
limited
to
exactly
what
the
body
needed
and
that
its
requirements
were
comparatively
low
regardless
of
conditions
or
exercise
the
standard
for
diet
very
often
allowed
as
much
as
per
cent
in
protein
this
percentage
has
been
gradually
reduced
by
the
discovery
of
the
actual
body
needs
so
that
now
it
is
believed
by
the
most
dependable
authorities
that
only
about
per
cent
of
the
entire
day
rations
for
the
adult
should
be
protein
the
growing
child
needs
a
greater
proportion
than
this
because
he
is
building
up
muscle
tissue
the
adult
whose
muscles
have
been
entirely
constructed
requires
protein
only
for
repair
and
per
cent
of
the
day
food
in
protein
is
sufficient
for
this
this
means
that
if
the
total
calories
for
the
day
are
only
of
them
need
be
protein
the
remainder
of
the
calories
are
largely
made
up
by
fat
and
carbohydrate
these
however
need
not
be
in
such
exact
proportion
as
the
protein
for
no
real
danger
lies
in
having
either
one
in
a
greater
amount
than
the
ideal
proportion
this
is
usually
fat
and
carbohydrate
or
in
a
diet
of
calories
fat
and
carbohydrate
the
carbohydrate
is
very
much
in
preponderance
because
of
its
easy
digestion
and
assimilation
as
may
be
imagined
it
is
not
a
simple
matter
to
figure
a
diet
as
closely
and
carefully
as
this
and
it
is
only
in
extreme
cases
where
such
planning
is
necessary
the
required
amount
of
protein
for
the
ordinary
daily
diet
can
be
had
with
about
ounces
of
meat
together
with
that
which
is
found
in
the
bread
vegetables
and
cereals
taken
each
day
at
any
rate
the
menu
should
be
planned
so
as
to
supply
a
protein
dish
for
at
least
one
meal
in
the
day
the
fat
is
supplied
largely
by
the
butter
taken
and
the
fat
used
in
the
cooking
of
foods
the
carbohydrate
is
provided
by
the
starch
found
in
cereals
bread
and
vegetables
and
by
the
sugar
contained
in
fruits
as
well
as
that
used
in
the
preparation
of
various
foods
and
in
the
sweetening
of
beverages
cereals
and
fruits
in
addition
to
providing
these
food
substances
each
meal
should
include
at
least
one
food
and
for
dinner
preferably
two
foods
that
will
supply
a
large
amount
of
mineral
salts
cellulose
and
vitamines
as
will
be
remembered
fruits
and
vegetables
are
the
foods
to
be
used
for
this
purpose
this
method
of
menu
planning
may
seem
somewhat
difficult
at
first
thought
but
in
reality
it
is
not
different
from
that
which
the
intelligent
housewife
follows
who
attempts
to
provide
her
family
with
a
variety
of
foods
and
who
appreciates
the
value
of
that
variety
if
she
plans
her
menu
in
this
manner
prepares
the
food
so
that
it
will
be
wholesome
easily
digested
and
given
in
the
proper
proportion
and
at
the
same
time
watches
the
weights
of
the
members
of
the
family
in
the
manner
suggested
she
need
have
no
fear
about
the
general
health
of
her
family
for
it
will
be
well
maintained
menu
making
and
table
service
general
rules
for
menu
making
perhaps
the
greatest
problem
in
the
planning
of
menus
for
a
family
is
that
of
securing
sufficient
variety
a
housewife
who
uses
the
same
recipes
and
the
same
combinations
of
food
repeatedly
is
apt
to
get
into
a
rut
and
the
members
of
her
family
will
undoubtedly
lose
interest
in
their
meals
this
condition
results
even
with
the
dishes
of
which
those
of
the
family
are
extremely
fond
however
they
will
not
tire
so
quickly
of
the
foods
they
care
for
if
such
foods
are
served
to
them
less
often
then
too
there
is
more
chance
to
practice
economy
when
a
larger
variety
of
food
is
used
the
importance
of
planning
menus
systematically
should
not
be
overlooked
either
no
matter
how
simple
they
may
be
even
if
breakfast
consists
of
only
two
or
more
dishes
luncheon
of
three
or
four
and
dinner
of
no
more
than
four
or
five
a
certain
amount
of
planning
should
be
done
in
order
that
the
meal
may
be
properly
balanced
if
the
suggestions
for
meal
planning
already
given
are
applied
to
this
work
very
little
difficulty
will
be
experienced
in
providing
meals
that
are
both
attractive
and
properly
balanced
in
addition
to
these
suggestions
a
few
general
rules
for
menu
making
ought
to
be
observed
most
of
these
are
simple
and
can
be
followed
with
very
little
effort
unless
the
menu
is
planned
for
a
special
occasion
the
cost
of
the
various
dishes
should
be
made
to
balance
for
instance
if
an
expensive
meat
is
to
be
served
the
vegetables
and
the
salad
selected
to
accompany
it
should
be
of
moderate
cost
on
the
other
hand
if
an
expensive
salad
is
to
be
served
a
dessert
of
moderate
cost
such
as
a
simple
rice
pudding
should
be
used
to
offset
the
price
of
the
other
dish
planning
meals
in
this
way
is
urged
for
the
sake
of
economy
and
if
it
is
carefully
followed
all
the
meals
may
be
made
to
average
about
the
same
cost
another
important
point
in
successful
meal
planning
is
the
avoidance
of
two
dishes
in
the
same
meal
made
from
the
same
food
for
instance
tomato
soup
and
tomato
salad
should
not
be
served
in
the
same
meal
for
the
combination
is
undesirable
corn
soup
contrasts
much
better
with
tomato
salad
than
does
the
tomato
soup
for
it
has
the
bland
flavor
that
is
needed
to
offset
the
acid
salad
some
housewives
it
is
true
object
to
such
planning
on
the
ground
that
it
does
not
give
them
opportunity
to
utilize
all
the
materials
they
may
have
on
hand
at
the
same
time
but
in
nearly
every
instance
the
materials
can
be
used
to
excellent
advantage
in
meals
that
are
to
follow
and
in
addition
the
gain
in
variety
is
sufficient
to
warrant
the
adoption
of
such
a
method
as
there
should
be
variety
in
the
materials
used
to
make
up
the
dishes
of
a
meal
so
should
there
be
variety
in
the
flavor
of
the
foods
selected
rice
macaroni
and
potato
for
instance
make
an
undesirable
combination
they
are
too
similar
because
they
are
all
high
in
starch
besides
they
resemble
one
another
too
closely
in
consistency
and
they
are
all
bland
in
flavor
if
a
meal
contains
one
or
two
bland
dishes
a
special
effort
should
be
made
to
supply
some
highly
flavored
dish
in
order
to
relieve
the
monotony
the
same
thing
may
be
said
of
acid
foods
that
is
an
oversupply
of
these
is
just
as
distasteful
as
too
many
bland
foods
to
have
fresh
fruit
for
the
daily
breakfast
would
be
very
delightful
but
such
fruit
can
not
always
be
secured
when
fresh
fruit
can
not
be
had
every
day
it
is
better
to
alternate
it
with
canned
fruit
or
stewed
dried
fruit
than
to
have
it
for
several
days
in
succession
and
then
have
to
serve
the
alternative
for
a
number
of
days
the
same
is
true
of
cereals
if
use
is
to
be
made
of
both
cooked
and
uncooked
cereals
it
is
much
better
to
alternate
them
than
to
serve
the
cooked
ones
for
breakfast
for
an
entire
week
and
then
uncooked
ones
the
next
week
when
two
vegetables
are
used
in
the
same
meal
they
should
be
different
sweet
potatoes
and
white
potatoes
although
often
served
together
do
not
belong
in
the
same
meal
in
fact
for
most
seasons
of
the
year
two
vegetables
dissimilar
in
consistency
should
be
supplied
for
instance
if
spinach
is
included
in
a
meal
some
contrasting
vegetable
such
as
carrots
shell
beans
should
be
served
with
it
beets
and
carrots
would
not
make
a
good
combination
nor
should
cabbage
be
combined
with
spinach
especially
if
both
vegetables
are
prepared
with
a
sour
dressing
a
bland
food
or
one
high
in
fat
such
as
roast
pork
certain
kinds
of
fish
is
much
more
palatable
if
a
highly
seasoned
sauce
or
another
highly
seasoned
food
or
in
fact
a
food
of
an
entirely
different
flavor
is
served
with
it
apple
sauce
or
baked
apples
are
usually
served
with
roast
pork
for
this
purpose
while
sour
sauces
or
pickles
of
some
description
are
served
with
fish
to
relieve
its
blandness
to
secure
the
most
successful
meals
the
main
course
should
be
decided
upon
first
and
the
additional
dishes
such
as
soup
salad
and
dessert
should
be
the
second
consideration
in
this
method
of
planning
meals
they
can
be
properly
balanced
for
if
the
main
course
is
heavy
the
others
can
be
made
light
or
some
of
them
omitted
altogether
while
if
the
main
course
is
a
light
one
heavier
dishes
may
be
selected
to
accompany
it
whenever
it
is
possible
to
do
so
the
heavy
meal
of
the
day
should
be
served
at
noon
and
the
lighter
one
in
the
evening
this
plan
should
always
be
followed
for
children
and
it
is
preferable
for
adults
however
having
dinner
at
noon
is
often
very
inconvenient
and
sometimes
impossible
because
frequently
one
or
more
members
of
the
family
are
at
business
some
distance
from
home
and
their
coming
home
at
noon
for
dinner
is
impractical
in
such
an
event
the
evening
meal
should
be
the
heavy
one
but
it
should
not
be
made
too
hearty
and
overeating
should
be
avoided
at
all
meals
tea
and
coffee
should
be
used
sparingly
especially
should
this
rule
be
followed
by
persons
who
are
nervous
or
high
strung
or
are
troubled
with
indigestion
and
insomnia
at
any
rate
it
is
advisable
not
to
drink
either
of
these
beverages
at
night
methods
of
securing
variety
in
meals
system
of
menu
making
with
the
general
rules
for
meal
planning
in
mind
the
housewife
is
well
prepared
to
arrange
menus
that
will
be
properly
balanced
as
well
as
varied
and
attractive
one
means
of
securing
variety
in
menus
and
at
the
same
time
supplying
oneself
with
a
very
convenient
piece
of
kitchen
equipment
consists
in
placing
the
recipes
used
on
small
cards
and
filing
them
in
a
card
file
under
the
headings
to
which
they
belong
as
shown
in
figs
and
for
instance
a
heading
should
be
made
for
soups
one
for
potatoes
and
so
on
these
cards
may
then
be
rotated
in
order
to
make
up
menus
when
the
first
card
of
each
group
has
been
used
it
should
be
placed
at
the
back
of
the
others
in
that
group
then
each
one
will
come
in
the
order
in
which
it
was
originally
placed
in
the
file
of
course
when
the
cards
are
not
filed
alphabetically
it
is
a
little
more
difficult
to
find
the
recipes
one
needs
at
a
particular
time
and
so
if
desired
other
means
of
using
the
cards
for
menu
making
may
be
easily
devised
without
changing
their
position
illustration
fig
in
addition
to
serving
as
a
basis
for
menus
this
arrangement
takes
the
place
of
a
cook
book
in
fact
it
is
much
more
convenient
for
instead
of
a
book
containing
recipes
on
the
table
where
the
work
is
being
done
a
small
card
which
takes
up
less
space
and
is
much
less
likely
to
be
in
the
way
may
be
substituted

it

a

it

but
a

of
suggestions
are

in

group
so
that
there
may

in

during

fresh

can
be

these
are
generally
used
as

first
course
for
breakfast
as
the
menus
here
given
show
it
is
well
to
vary
the
fruit
course
as
much
as
possible
so
that
there
will
be
no
danger
of
tiring
the
persons
to
be
served
an
uncooked
breakfast
food
is
preferable
to
a

one
for

special

new

easter

are
usually
celebrated
with

that
is
somewhat
out

the
ordinary
then
too
on
such
days
as
valentine
patrick
it
is
often
desired
to
invite
friends
in
for
a
social
time
of
some
kind
when
dainty
appetizing
refreshments
make
up

entertainment

assist
the
housewife

menus
for
occasions
of
this
kind
a
number
of
suggestions
are
here
given
suitable
decorations
are
also
mentioned
in
each
instance
for
much
of
the
attraction
of
a
special
dinner
or
luncheon
depends
on
the
form
of
decoration
used
it
should
not
be
thought
that
elaborate
costly
decorations
are
necessary
for
often
the
most
effective
results
can
be
achieved
with
some
very
simple
decoration
of
course
the
decorations
should
be
suitable
for
the
occasion
to
be
celebrated
favors
of
various
kinds
are
generally
on
sale
in
confectioners
and
stationers
shops
so
that
if
desired
favors
may
be
purchased
however
the
ingenious
housewife
can
with
very
little
trouble
make
favors
that
will
be
just
as
attractive
as
those
she
can
buy
and
that
will
be
much
less
expensive
she
may
copy
some
she
sees
in
the
shops

essentials
of
good
table
too
much
can
not
be
said
of
the
importance
of
attractive
table
service
the
simplest
kind
of
meal
served
attractively
never
fails
to
please
while
the
most
elaborate
meal
served
in
an
uninviting
way
will
not
appeal
to
the
appetite
therefore
a
housewife
should
try
never
to
neglect
the
little
points
that
count
so
much
in
making
her
meals
pleasing
and
inviting
it
is
not
at
all
necessary
that
she
have
expensive
dishes
and
linen
nor
in
fact
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
in
order
to
serve
meals
in
a
dainty
attractive
way
some
points
however
are
really
essential
and
should
receive
consideration
in
the
first
place
there
should
be
absolute
cleanliness
in
everything
used
to
make
this
possible
the
dishes
should
be
properly
washed
and
dried
the
glasses
should
be
polished
so
that
they
are
not
cloudy
nor
covered
with
lint
the
silver
should
be
kept
polished
brightly
the
linen
no
matter
what
kind
should
be
nicely
laundered
attention
given
to
these
matters
forms
the
basis
of
good
table
service
illustration
fig
close
in
hand
with
these
points
comes
a
and
neatly
set
table
to
this
may
be
added
some
attractive
touches
in
the
way
of
flowers
or
other
simple
decoration
these
need
cost
little
or
nothing
especially
in
the
spring
and
summer
seasons
for
then
the
fields
and
woods
are
filled
with
flowers
and
foliage
that
make
most
artistic
table
decorations
often
too
one
own
garden
offers
a
nice
selection
of
flowers
that
may
be
used
for
table
decoration
if
a
little
time
and
thought
are
given
to
their
arrangement
in
the
winter
a
small
fern
or
some
other
growing
plant
will
answer
breakfast
luncheon
and
dinner
to
give
an
idea
of
proper
table
service
for
the
three
meals
breakfast
luncheon
and
dinner
figs
and
are
offered
attention
should
be
given
to
the
details
of
each
of
these
for
they
show
how
to
arrange
meals
that
are
intended
to
be
served
tastily
and
invitingly
in
fig
is
shown
a
breakfast
cover
for
one
by
a
is
meant
the
silver
and
dishes
placed
on
the
table
for
one
person
in
a
simple
meal
this
might
consist
of
a
knife
a
fork
spoons
a
plate
a
glass
a
cup
and
saucer
and
a
plate
here
the
cover
has
been
arranged
on
a
breakfast
tray
for
service
at
a
bedside
this
meal
is
not
in
the
least
unusual
but
it
is
very
dainty
and
pleasing
it
consists
of
strawberries
with
the
stems
left
on
so
that
they
may
be
dipped
into
sugar
and
eaten
a
cereal
a
roll
with
butter
a
hot
dish
of
some
kind
such
as
eggs
and
a
hot
beverage
illustration
fig
a
luncheon
table
with
covers
for
six
is
shown
in
fig
the
first
course
consists
of
a
fruit
cocktail
which
is
placed
on
the
table
before
the
persons
to
be
served
are
seated
the
silver
required
up
to
the
dessert
course
is
also
laid
beforehand
just
before
the
dessert
is
served
the
entire
table
should
be
cleared
and
the
silver
necessary
for
this
course
laid
at
each
place
a
point
to
be
remembered
in
the
placing
of
silver
is
that
the
various
pieces
should
always
be
placed
on
the
table
in
the
order
in
which
they
are
to
be
used
here
the
first
spoon
is
for
the
cocktail
which
is
already
on
the
table
while
the
second
spoon
is
for
the
soup
the
next
course
the
knife
which
is
the
third
piece
of
silver
with
the
two
forks
on
the
opposite
side
will
be
required
for
the
dinner
course
while
the
third
fork
is
a
fork
for
the
salad
course
as
will
be
noted
doilies
have
been
used
in
place
of
a
table
cloth
for
this
luncheon
these
which
may
be
as
simple
or
as
elaborate
as
desired
save
laundering
and
if
they
are
inexpensive
they
are
an
economy
as
well
as
a
convenience
since
they
also
make
a
luncheon
table
very
attractive
they
are
strongly
recommended
for
meals
of
this
kind
the
luncheon
napkin
which
is
smaller
than
that
used
for
dinner
service
should
always
be
placed
where
it
is
shown
here
that
is
at
the
left
of
the
forks
if
only
one
beverage
is
to
be
served
