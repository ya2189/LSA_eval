the
soul
of
man
the
chief
advantage
that
would
result
from
the
establishment
of
socialism
is
undoubtedly
the
fact
that
socialism
would
relieve
us
from
that
sordid
necessity
of
living
for
others
which
in
the
present
condition
of
things
presses
so
hardly
upon
almost
everybody
in
fact
scarcely
anyone
at
all
escapes
now
and
then
in
the
course
of
the
century
a
great
man
of
science
like
darwin
a
great
poet
like
keats
a
fine
critical
spirit
like
renan
a
supreme
artist
like
flaubert
has
been
able
to
isolate
himself
to
keep
himself
out
of
reach
of
the
clamorous
claims
of
others
to
stand
the
shelter
of
the
wall
as
plato
puts
it
and
so
to
realise
the
perfection
of
what
was
in
him
to
his
own
incomparable
gain
and
to
the
incomparable
and
lasting
gain
of
the
whole
world
these
however
are
exceptions
the
majority
of
people
spoil
their
lives
by
an
unhealthy
and
exaggerated
forced
indeed
so
to
spoil
them
they
find
themselves
surrounded
by
hideous
poverty
by
hideous
ugliness
by
hideous
starvation
it
is
inevitable
that
they
should
be
strongly
moved
by
all
this
the
emotions
of
man
are
stirred
more
quickly
than
intelligence
and
as
i
pointed
out
some
time
ago
in
an
article
on
the
function
of
criticism
it
is
much
more
easy
to
have
sympathy
with
suffering
than
it
is
to
have
sympathy
with
thought
accordingly
with
admirable
though
misdirected
intentions
they
very
seriously
and
very
sentimentally
set
themselves
to
the
task
of
remedying
the
evils
that
they
see
but
their
remedies
do
not
cure
the
disease
they
merely
prolong
it
indeed
their
remedies
are
part
of
the
disease
they
try
to
solve
the
problem
of
poverty
for
instance
by
keeping
the
poor
alive
or
in
the
case
of
a
very
advanced
school
by
amusing
the
poor
but
this
is
not
a
solution
it
is
an
aggravation
of
the
difficulty
the
proper
aim
is
to
try
and
reconstruct
society
on
such
a
basis
that
poverty
will
be
impossible
and
the
altruistic
virtues
have
really
prevented
the
carrying
out
of
this
aim
just
as
the
worst
were
those
who
were
kind
to
their
slaves
and
so
prevented
the
horror
of
the
system
being
realised
by
those
who
suffered
from
it
and
understood
by
those
who
contemplated
it
so
in
the
present
state
of
things
in
england
the
people
who
do
most
harm
are
the
people
who
try
to
do
most
good
and
at
last
we
have
had
the
spectacle
of
men
who
have
really
studied
the
problem
and
know
the
men
who
live
in
the
east
forward
and
imploring
the
community
to
restrain
its
altruistic
impulses
of
charity
benevolence
and
the
like
they
do
so
on
the
ground
that
such
charity
degrades
and
demoralises
they
are
perfectly
right
charity
creates
a
multitude
of
sins
there
is
also
this
to
be
said
it
is
immoral
to
use
private
property
in
order
to
alleviate
the
horrible
evils
that
result
from
the
institution
of
private
property
it
is
both
immoral
and
unfair
under
socialism
all
this
will
of
course
be
altered
there
will
be
no
people
living
in
fetid
dens
and
fetid
rags
and
bringing
up
unhealthy
children
in
the
midst
of
impossible
and
absolutely
repulsive
surroundings
the
security
of
society
will
not
depend
as
it
does
now
on
the
state
of
the
weather
if
a
frost
comes
we
shall
not
have
a
hundred
thousand
men
out
of
work
tramping
about
the
streets
in
a
state
of
disgusting
misery
or
whining
to
their
neighbours
for
alms
or
crowding
round
the
doors
of
loathsome
shelters
to
try
and
secure
a
hunch
of
bread
and
a
unclean
lodging
each
member
of
the
society
will
share
in
the
general
prosperity
and
happiness
of
the
society
and
if
a
frost
comes
no
one
will
practically
be
anything
the
worse
upon
the
other
hand
socialism
itself
will
be
of
value
simply
because
it
will
lead
to
individualism
socialism
communism
or
whatever
one
chooses
to
call
it
by
converting
private
property
into
public
wealth
and
substituting
for
competition
will
restore
society
to
its
proper
condition
of
a
thoroughly
healthy
organism
and
insure
the
material
of
each
member
of
the
community
it
will
in
fact
give
life
its
proper
basis
and
its
proper
environment
but
for
the
full
development
of
life
to
its
highest
mode
of
perfection
something
more
is
needed
what
is
needed
is
individualism
if
the
socialism
is
authoritarian
if
there
are
governments
armed
with
economic
power
as
they
are
now
with
political
power
if
in
a
word
we
are
to
have
industrial
tyrannies
then
the
last
state
of
man
will
be
worse
than
the
first
at
present
in
consequence
of
the
existence
of
private
property
a
great
many
people
are
enabled
to
develop
a
certain
very
limited
amount
of
individualism
they
are
either
under
no
necessity
to
work
for
their
living
or
are
enabled
to
choose
the
sphere
of
activity
that
is
really
congenial
to
them
and
gives
them
pleasure
these
are
the
poets
the
philosophers
the
men
of
science
the
men
of
a
word
the
real
men
the
men
who
have
realised
themselves
and
in
whom
all
humanity
gains
a
partial
realisation
upon
the
other
hand
there
are
a
great
many
people
who
having
no
private
property
of
their
own
and
being
always
on
the
brink
of
sheer
starvation
are
compelled
to
do
the
work
of
beasts
of
burden
to
do
work
that
is
quite
uncongenial
to
them
and
to
which
they
are
forced
by
the
peremptory
unreasonable
degrading
tyranny
of
want
these
are
the
poor
and
amongst
them
there
is
no
grace
of
manner
or
charm
of
speech
or
civilisation
or
culture
or
refinement
in
pleasures
or
joy
of
life
from
their
collective
force
humanity
gains
much
in
material
prosperity
but
it
is
only
the
material
result
that
it
gains
and
the
man
who
is
poor
is
in
himself
absolutely
of
no
importance
he
is
merely
the
infinitesimal
atom
of
a
force
that
so
far
from
regarding
him
crushes
him
indeed
prefers
him
crushed
as
in
that
case
he
is
far
more
obedient
of
course
it
might
be
said
that
the
individualism
generated
under
conditions
of
private
property
is
not
always
or
even
as
a
rule
of
a
fine
or
wonderful
type
and
that
the
poor
if
they
have
not
culture
and
charm
have
still
many
virtues
both
these
statements
would
be
quite
true
the
possession
of
private
property
is
very
often
extremely
demoralising
and
that
is
of
course
one
of
the
reasons
why
socialism
wants
to
get
rid
of
the
institution
in
fact
property
is
really
a
nuisance
some
years
ago
people
went
about
the
country
saying
that
property
has
duties
they
said
it
so
often
and
so
tediously
that
at
last
the
church
has
begun
to
say
it
one
hears
it
now
from
every
pulpit
it
is
perfectly
true
property
not
merely
has
duties
but
has
so
many
duties
that
its
possession
to
any
large
extent
is
a
bore
it
involves
endless
claims
upon
one
endless
attention
to
business
endless
bother
if
property
had
simply
pleasures
we
could
stand
it
but
its
duties
make
it
unbearable
in
the
interest
of
the
rich
we
must
get
rid
of
it
the
virtues
of
the
poor
may
be
readily
admitted
and
are
much
to
be
regretted
we
are
often
told
that
the
poor
are
grateful
for
charity
some
of
them
are
no
doubt
but
the
best
amongst
the
poor
are
never
grateful
they
are
ungrateful
discontented
disobedient
and
rebellious
they
are
quite
right
to
be
so
charity
they
feel
to
be
a
ridiculously
inadequate
mode
of
partial
restitution
or
a
sentimental
dole
usually
accompanied
by
some
impertinent
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
sentimentalist
to
tyrannise
over
their
private
lives
why
should
they
be
grateful
for
the
crumbs
that
fall
from
the
rich
table
they
should
be
seated
at
the
board
and
are
beginning
to
know
it
as
for
being
discontented
a
man
who
would
not
be
discontented
with
such
surroundings
and
such
a
low
mode
of
life
would
be
a
perfect
brute
disobedience
in
the
eyes
of
anyone
who
has
read
history
is
original
virtue
it
is
through
disobedience
that
progress
has
been
made
through
disobedience
and
through
rebellion
sometimes
the
poor
are
praised
for
being
thrifty
but
to
recommend
thrift
to
the
poor
is
both
grotesque
and
insulting
it
is
like
advising
a
man
who
is
starving
to
eat
less
for
a
town
or
country
labourer
to
practise
thrift
would
be
absolutely
immoral
man
should
not
be
ready
to
show
that
he
can
live
like
a
animal
he
should
decline
to
live
like
that
and
should
either
steal
or
go
on
the
rates
which
is
considered
by
many
to
be
a
form
of
stealing
as
for
begging
it
is
safer
to
beg
than
to
take
but
it
is
finer
to
take
than
to
beg
no
a
poor
man
who
is
ungrateful
unthrifty
discontented
and
rebellious
is
probably
a
real
personality
and
has
much
in
him
he
is
at
any
rate
a
healthy
protest
as
for
the
virtuous
poor
one
can
pity
them
of
course
but
one
can
not
possibly
admire
them
they
have
made
private
terms
with
the
enemy
and
sold
their
birthright
for
very
bad
pottage
they
must
also
be
extraordinarily
stupid
i
can
quite
understand
a
man
accepting
laws
that
protect
private
property
and
admit
of
its
accumulation
as
long
as
he
himself
is
able
under
those
conditions
to
realise
some
form
of
beautiful
and
intellectual
life
but
it
is
almost
incredible
to
me
how
a
man
whose
life
is
marred
and
made
hideous
by
such
laws
can
possibly
acquiesce
in
their
continuance
however
the
explanation
is
not
really
difficult
to
find
it
is
simply
this
misery
and
poverty
are
so
absolutely
degrading
and
exercise
such
a
paralysing
effect
over
the
nature
of
men
that
no
class
is
ever
really
conscious
of
its
own
suffering
they
have
to
be
told
of
it
by
other
people
and
they
often
entirely
disbelieve
them
what
is
said
by
great
employers
of
labour
against
agitators
is
unquestionably
true
agitators
are
a
set
of
interfering
meddling
people
who
come
down
to
some
perfectly
contented
class
of
the
community
and
sow
the
seeds
of
discontent
amongst
them
that
is
the
reason
why
agitators
are
so
absolutely
necessary
without
them
in
our
incomplete
state
there
would
be
no
advance
towards
civilisation
slavery
was
put
down
in
america
not
in
consequence
of
any
action
on
the
part
of
the
slaves
or
even
any
express
desire
on
their
part
that
they
should
be
free
it
was
put
down
entirely
through
the
grossly
illegal
conduct
of
certain
agitators
in
boston
and
elsewhere
who
were
not
slaves
themselves
nor
owners
of
slaves
nor
had
anything
to
do
with
the
question
really
it
was
undoubtedly
the
abolitionists
who
set
the
torch
alight
who
began
the
whole
thing
and
it
is
curious
to
note
that
from
the
slaves
themselves
they
received
not
merely
very
little
assistance
but
hardly
any
sympathy
even
and
when
at
the
close
of
the
war
the
slaves
found
themselves
free
found
themselves
indeed
so
absolutely
free
that
they
were
free
to
starve
many
of
them
bitterly
regretted
the
new
state
of
things
to
the
thinker
the
most
tragic
fact
in
the
whole
of
the
french
revolution
is
not
that
marie
antoinette
was
killed
for
being
a
queen
but
that
the
starved
peasant
of
the
vendée
voluntarily
went
out
to
die
for
the
hideous
cause
of
feudalism
it
is
clear
then
that
no
authoritarian
socialism
will
do
for
while
under
the
present
system
a
very
large
number
of
people
can
lead
lives
of
a
certain
amount
of
freedom
and
expression
and
happiness
under
an
system
or
a
system
of
economic
tyranny
nobody
would
be
able
to
have
any
such
freedom
at
all
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
a
portion
of
our
community
should
be
practically
in
slavery
but
to
propose
to
solve
the
problem
by
enslaving
the
entire
community
is
childish
every
man
must
be
left
quite
free
to
choose
his
own
work
no
form
of
compulsion
must
be
exercised
over
him
if
there
is
his
work
will
not
be
good
for
him
will
not
be
good
in
itself
and
will
not
be
good
for
others
and
by
work
i
simply
mean
activity
of
any
kind
i
hardly
think
that
any
socialist
nowadays
would
seriously
propose
that
an
inspector
should
call
every
morning
at
each
house
to
see
that
each
citizen
rose
up
and
did
manual
labour
for
eight
hours
humanity
has
got
beyond
that
stage
and
reserves
such
a
form
of
life
for
the
people
whom
in
a
very
arbitrary
manner
it
chooses
to
call
criminals
but
i
confess
that
many
of
the
socialistic
views
that
i
have
come
across
seem
to
me
to
be
tainted
with
ideas
of
authority
if
not
of
actual
compulsion
of
course
authority
and
compulsion
are
out
of
the
question
all
association
must
be
quite
voluntary
it
is
only
in
voluntary
associations
that
man
is
fine
but
it
may
be
asked
how
individualism
which
is
now
more
or
less
dependent
on
the
existence
of
private
property
for
its
development
will
benefit
by
the
abolition
of
such
private
property
the
answer
is
very
simple
it
is
true
that
under
existing
conditions
a
few
men
who
have
had
private
means
of
their
own
such
as
byron
shelley
browning
victor
hugo
baudelaire
and
others
have
been
able
to
realise
their
personality
more
or
less
completely
not
one
of
these
men
ever
did
a
single
work
for
hire
they
were
relieved
from
poverty
they
had
an
immense
advantage
the
question
is
whether
it
would
be
for
the
good
of
individualism
that
such
an
advantage
should
be
taken
away
let
us
suppose
that
it
is
taken
away
what
happens
then
to
individualism
how
will
it
benefit
it
will
benefit
in
this
way
under
the
new
conditions
individualism
will
be
far
freer
far
finer
and
far
more
intensified
than
it
is
now
i
am
not
talking
of
the
great
individualism
of
such
poets
as
i
have
mentioned
but
of
the
great
actual
individualism
latent
and
potential
in
mankind
generally
for
the
recognition
of
private
property
has
really
harmed
individualism
and
obscured
it
by
confusing
a
man
with
what
he
possesses
it
has
led
individualism
entirely
astray
it
has
made
gain
not
growth
its
aim
so
that
man
thought
that
the
important
thing
was
to
have
and
did
not
know
that
the
important
thing
is
to
be
the
true
perfection
of
man
lies
not
in
what
man
has
but
in
what
man
is
private
property
has
crushed
true
individualism
and
set
up
an
individualism
that
is
false
it
has
debarred
one
part
of
the
community
from
being
individual
by
starving
them
it
has
debarred
the
other
part
of
the
community
from
being
individual
by
putting
them
on
the
wrong
road
and
encumbering
them
indeed
so
completely
has
personality
been
absorbed
by
his
possessions
that
the
english
law
has
always
treated
offences
against
a
property
with
far
more
severity
than
offences
against
his
person
and
property
is
still
the
test
of
complete
citizenship
the
industry
necessary
for
the
making
money
is
also
very
demoralising
in
a
community
like
ours
where
property
confers
immense
distinction
social
position
honour
respect
titles
and
other
pleasant
things
of
the
kind
man
being
naturally
ambitious
makes
it
his
aim
to
accumulate
this
property
and
goes
on
wearily
and
tediously
accumulating
it
long
after
he
has
got
far
more
than
he
wants
or
can
use
or
enjoy
or
perhaps
even
know
of
man
will
kill
himself
by
overwork
in
order
to
secure
property
and
really
considering
the
enormous
advantages
that
property
brings
one
is
hardly
surprised
regret
is
that
society
should
be
constructed
on
such
a
basis
that
man
has
been
forced
into
a
groove
in
which
he
can
not
freely
develop
what
is
wonderful
and
fascinating
and
delightful
in
which
in
fact
he
misses
the
true
pleasure
and
joy
of
living
he
is
also
under
existing
conditions
very
insecure
an
enormously
wealthy
merchant
may
every
moment
of
his
life
at
the
mercy
of
things
that
are
not
under
his
control
if
the
wind
blows
an
extra
point
or
so
or
the
weather
suddenly
changes
or
some
trivial
thing
happens
his
ship
may
go
down
his
speculations
may
go
wrong
and
he
finds
himself
a
poor
man
with
his
social
position
quite
gone
now
nothing
should
be
able
to
harm
a
man
except
himself
nothing
should
be
able
to
rob
a
man
at
all
what
a
man
really
has
is
what
is
in
him
what
is
outside
of
him
should
be
a
matter
of
no
importance
with
the
abolition
of
private
property
then
we
shall
have
true
beautiful
healthy
individualism
nobody
will
waste
his
life
in
accumulating
things
and
the
symbols
for
things
one
will
live
to
live
is
the
rarest
thing
in
the
world
most
people
exist
that
is
all
it
is
a
question
whether
we
have
ever
seen
the
full
expression
of
a
personality
except
on
the
imaginative
plane
of
art
in
action
we
never
have
cæsar
says
mommsen
was
the
complete
and
perfect
man
but
how
tragically
insecure
was
cæsar
wherever
there
is
a
man
who
exercises
authority
there
is
a
man
who
resists
authority
cæsar
was
very
perfect
but
his
perfection
travelled
by
too
dangerous
a
road
marcus
aurelius
was
the
perfect
man
says
renan
yes
the
great
emperor
was
a
perfect
man
but
how
intolerable
were
the
endless
claims
upon
him
he
staggered
under
the
burden
of
the
empire
he
was
conscious
how
inadequate
one
man
was
to
bear
the
weight
of
that
titan
and
too
vast
orb
what
i
mean
by
a
perfect
man
is
one
who
develops
under
perfect
conditions
one
who
is
not
wounded
or
worried
or
maimed
or
in
danger
most
personalities
have
been
obliged
to
be
rebels
half
their
strength
has
been
wasted
in
friction
personality
for
instance
was
terribly
wasted
in
its
battle
with
the
stupidity
and
hypocrisy
and
philistinism
of
the
english
such
battles
do
not
always
intensify
strength
they
often
exaggerate
weakness
byron
was
never
able
to
give
us
what
he
might
have
given
us
shelley
escaped
better
like
byron
he
got
out
of
england
as
soon
as
possible
but
he
was
not
so
well
known
if
the
english
had
had
any
idea
of
what
a
great
poet
he
really
was
they
would
have
fallen
on
him
with
tooth
and
nail
and
made
his
life
as
unbearable
to
him
as
they
possibly
could
but
he
was
not
a
remarkable
figure
in
society
and
consequently
he
escaped
to
a
certain
degree
still
even
in
shelley
the
note
of
rebellion
is
sometimes
too
strong
the
note
of
the
perfect
personality
is
not
rebellion
but
peace
it
will
be
a
marvellous
true
personality
of
we
see
it
it
will
grow
naturally
and
simply
flowerlike
or
as
a
tree
grows
it
will
not
be
at
discord
it
will
never
argue
or
dispute
it
will
not
prove
things
it
will
know
everything
and
yet
it
will
not
busy
itself
about
knowledge
it
will
have
wisdom
its
value
will
not
be
measured
by
material
things
it
will
have
nothing
and
yet
it
will
have
everything
and
whatever
one
takes
from
it
it
will
still
have
so
rich
will
it
be
it
will
not
be
always
meddling
with
others
or
asking
them
to
be
like
itself
it
will
love
them
because
they
will
be
different
and
yet
while
it
will
not
meddle
with
others
it
will
help
all
as
a
beautiful
thing
helps
us
by
being
what
it
is
the
personality
of
man
will
be
very
wonderful
it
will
be
as
wonderful
as
the
personality
of
a
child
in
its
development
it
will
be
assisted
by
christianity
if
men
desire
that
but
if
men
do
not
desire
that
it
will
develop
none
the
less
surely
for
it
will
not
worry
itself
about
the
past
nor
care
whether
things
happened
or
did
not
happen
nor
will
it
admit
any
laws
but
its
own
laws
nor
any
authority
but
its
own
authority
yet
it
will
love
those
who
sought
to
intensify
it
and
speak
often
of
them
and
of
these
christ
was
one
was
written
over
the
portal
of
the
antique
world
over
the
portal
of
the
new
world
shall
be
written
and
the
message
of
christ
to
man
was
simply
that
is
the
secret
of
christ
when
jesus
talks
about
the
poor
he
simply
means
personalities
just
as
when
he
talks
about
the
rich
he
simply
means
people
who
have
not
developed
their
personalities
jesus
moved
in
a
community
that
allowed
the
accumulation
of
private
property
just
as
ours
does
and
the
gospel
that
he
preached
was
not
that
in
such
a
community
it
is
an
advantage
for
a
man
to
live
on
scanty
unwholesome
food
to
wear
ragged
unwholesome
clothes
to
sleep
in
horrid
unwholesome
dwellings
and
a
disadvantage
for
a
man
to
live
under
healthy
pleasant
and
decent
conditions
such
a
view
would
have
been
wrong
there
and
then
and
would
of
course
be
still
more
wrong
now
and
in
england
for
as
man
moves
northward
the
material
necessities
of
life
become
of
more
vital
importance
and
our
society
is
infinitely
more
complex
and
displays
far
greater
extremes
of
luxury
and
pauperism
than
any
society
of
the
antique
world
what
jesus
meant
was
this
he
said
to
man
have
a
wonderful
personality
develop
it
be
yourself
imagine
that
your
perfection
lies
in
accumulating
or
possessing
external
things
your
affection
is
inside
of
you
if
only
you
could
realise
that
you
would
not
want
to
be
rich
ordinary
riches
can
be
stolen
from
a
man
real
riches
can
not
in
the
of
your
soul
there
are
infinitely
precious
things
that
may
not
be
taken
from
you
and
so
try
to
so
shape
your
life
that
external
things
will
not
harm
you
and
try
also
to
get
rid
of
personal
property
it
involves
sordid
preoccupation
endless
industry
continual
wrong
personal
property
hinders
individualism
at
every
it
is
to
be
noted
that
jesus
never
says
that
impoverished
people
are
necessarily
good
or
wealthy
people
necessarily
bad
that
would
not
have
been
true
wealthy
people
are
as
a
class
better
than
impoverished
people
more
moral
more
intellectual
more
there
is
only
one
class
in
the
community
that
thinks
more
about
money
than
the
rich
and
that
is
the
poor
the
poor
can
think
of
nothing
else
that
is
the
misery
of
being
poor
what
jesus
does
say
is
that
man
reaches
his
perfection
not
through
what
he
has
not
even
through
what
he
does
but
entirely
through
what
he
is
and
so
the
wealthy
young
man
who
comes
to
jesus
is
represented
as
a
thoroughly
good
citizen
who
has
broken
none
of
the
laws
of
his
state
none
of
the
commandments
of
his
religion
he
is
quite
respectable
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
that
extraordinary
word
jesus
says
to
him
should
give
up
private
property
it
hinders
you
from
realising
your
perfection
it
is
a
drag
upon
you
it
is
a
burden
your
personality
does
not
need
it
it
is
within
you
and
not
outside
of
you
that
you
will
find
what
you
really
are
and
what
you
really
to
his
own
friends
he
says
the
same
thing
he
tells
them
to
be
themselves
and
not
to
be
always
worrying
about
other
things
what
do
other
things
matter
man
is
complete
in
himself
when
they
go
into
the
world
the
world
will
disagree
with
them
that
is
inevitable
the
world
hates
individualism
but
that
is
not
to
trouble
them
they
are
to
be
calm
and
if
a
man
takes
their
cloak
they
are
to
give
him
their
coat
just
to
show
that
material
things
are
of
no
importance
if
people
abuse
them
they
are
not
to
answer
back
what
does
it
signify
the
things
people
say
of
a
man
do
not
alter
a
man
he
is
what
he
is
public
opinion
is
of
no
value
whatsoever
even
if
people
employ
actual
violence
they
are
not
to
be
violent
in
turn
that
would
be
to
fall
to
the
same
low
level
after
all
even
in
prison
a
man
can
be
quite
free
his
soul
can
be
free
his
personality
can
be
untroubled
he
can
be
at
peace
and
above
all
things
they
are
not
to
interfere
with
other
people
or
judge
them
in
any
way
personality
is
a
very
mysterious
thing
a
man
can
not
always
be
estimated
by
what
he
does
he
may
keep
the
law
and
yet
be
worthless
he
may
break
the
law
and
yet
be
fine
he
may
be
bad
without
ever
doing
anything
bad
he
may
commit
a
sin
against
society
and
yet
realise
through
that
sin
his
true
perfection
there
was
a
woman
who
was
taken
in
adultery
we
are
not
told
the
history
of
her
love
but
that
love
must
have
been
very
great
for
jesus
said
that
her
sins
were
forgiven
her
not
because
she
repented
but
because
her
love
was
so
intense
and
wonderful
later
on
a
short
time
before
his
death
as
he
sat
at
a
feast
the
woman
came
in
and
poured
costly
perfumes
on
his
hair
his
friends
tried
to
interfere
with
her
and
said
that
it
was
an
extravagance
and
that
the
money
that
the
perfume
cost
should
have
been
expended
on
charitable
relief
of
people
in
want
or
something
of
that
kind
jesus
did
not
accept
that
view
he
pointed
out
that
the
material
needs
of
man
were
great
and
very
permanent
but
that
the
spiritual
needs
of
man
were
greater
still
and
that
in
one
divine
moment
and
by
selecting
its
own
mode
of
expression
a
personality
might
make
itself
perfect
the
world
worships
the
woman
even
now
as
a
saint
yes
there
are
suggestive
things
in
individualism
socialism
annihilates
family
life
for
instance
with
the
abolition
of
private
property
marriage
in
its
present
form
must
disappear
this
is
part
of
the
programme
individualism
accepts
this
and
makes
it
fine
it
converts
the
abolition
of
legal
restraint
into
a
form
of
freedom
that
will
help
the
full
development
of
personality
and
make
the
love
of
man
and
woman
more
wonderful
more
beautiful
and
more
ennobling
jesus
knew
this
he
rejected
the
claims
of
family
life
although
they
existed
in
his
day
and
community
in
a
very
marked
form
is
my
mother
who
are
my
brothers
he
said
when
he
was
told
that
they
wished
to
speak
to
him
when
one
of
his
followers
asked
leave
to
go
and
bury
his
father
the
dead
bury
the
dead
was
his
terrible
answer
he
would
allow
no
claim
whatsoever
to
be
made
on
personality
and
so
he
who
would
lead
a
christlike
life
is
he
who
is
perfectly
and
absolutely
himself
he
may
be
a
great
poet
or
a
great
man
of
science
or
a
young
student
at
a
university
or
one
who
watches
sheep
upon
a
moor
or
a
maker
of
dramas
like
shakespeare
or
a
thinker
about
god
like
spinoza
or
a
child
who
plays
in
a
garden
or
a
fisherman
who
throws
his
net
into
the
sea
it
does
not
matter
what
he
is
as
long
as
he
realises
the
perfection
of
the
soul
that
is
within
him
all
imitation
in
morals
and
in
life
is
wrong
through
the
streets
of
jerusalem
at
the
present
day
crawls
one
who
is
mad
and
carries
a
wooden
cross
on
his
shoulders
he
is
a
symbol
of
the
lives
that
are
marred
by
imitation
father
damien
was
christlike
when
he
went
out
to
live
with
the
lepers
because
in
such
service
he
realised
fully
what
was
best
in
him
but
he
was
not
more
christlike
than
wagner
when
he
realised
his
soul
in
music
or
than
shelley
when
he
realised
his
soul
in
song
there
is
no
one
type
for
man
there
are
as
many
perfections
as
there
are
imperfect
men
and
while
to
the
claims
of
charity
a
man
may
yield
and
yet
be
free
to
the
claims
of
conformity
no
man
may
yield
and
remain
free
at
all
individualism
then
is
what
through
socialism
we
are
to
attain
to
as
a
natural
result
the
state
must
give
up
all
idea
of
government
it
must
give
it
up
because
as
a
wise
man
once
said
many
centuries
before
christ
there
is
such
a
thing
as
leaving
mankind
alone
there
is
no
such
thing
as
governing
mankind
all
modes
of
government
are
failures
despotism
is
unjust
to
everybody
including
the
despot
who
was
probably
made
for
better
things
oligarchies
are
unjust
to
the
many
and
ochlocracies
are
unjust
to
the
few
high
hopes
were
once
formed
of
democracy
but
democracy
means
simply
the
bludgeoning
of
the
people
by
the
people
for
the
people
it
has
been
found
out
i
must
say
that
it
was
high
time
for
all
authority
is
quite
degrading
it
degrades
those
who
exercise
it
and
degrades
those
over
whom
it
is
exercised
when
it
is
violently
grossly
and
cruelly
used
it
produces
a
good
effect
by
creating
or
at
any
rate
bringing
out
the
spirit
of
revolt
and
individualism
that
is
to
kill
it
when
it
is
used
with
a
certain
amount
of
kindness
and
accompanied
by
prizes
and
rewards
it
is
dreadfully
demoralising
people
in
that
case
are
less
conscious
of
the
horrible
pressure
that
is
being
put
on
them
and
so
go
through
their
lives
in
a
sort
of
coarse
comfort
like
petted
animals
without
ever
realising
that
they
are
probably
thinking
other
thoughts
living
by
other
standards
wearing
practically
what
one
may
call
other
clothes
and
never
being
themselves
for
a
single
moment
who
would
be
free
says
a
fine
thinker
not
and
authority
by
bribing
people
to
conform
produces
a
very
gross
kind
of
barbarism
amongst
us
with
authority
punishment
will
pass
away
this
will
be
a
great
gain
in
fact
of
incalculable
value
as
one
reads
history
not
in
the
expurgated
editions
written
for
and
passmen
but
in
the
original
authorities
of
each
time
one
is
absolutely
sickened
not
by
the
crimes
that
the
wicked
have
committed
but
by
the
punishments
that
the
good
have
inflicted
and
a
community
is
infinitely
more
brutalised
by
the
habitual
employment
of
punishment
than
it
is
by
the
occurrence
of
crime
it
obviously
follows
that
the
more
punishment
is
inflicted
the
more
crime
is
produced
and
most
modern
legislation
has
clearly
recognised
this
and
has
made
it
its
task
to
diminish
punishment
as
far
as
it
thinks
it
can
wherever
it
has
really
diminished
it
the
results
have
always
been
extremely
good
the
less
punishment
the
less
crime
when
there
is
no
punishment
at
all
crime
will
either
cease
to
exist
or
if
it
occurs
will
be
treated
by
physicians
as
a
very
distressing
form
of
dementia
to
be
cured
by
care
and
kindness
for
what
are
called
criminals
nowadays
are
not
criminals
at
all
starvation
and
not
sin
is
the
parent
of
modern
crime
that
indeed
is
the
reason
why
our
criminals
are
as
a
class
so
absolutely
uninteresting
from
any
psychological
point
of
view
they
are
not
marvellous
macbeths
and
terrible
vautrins
they
are
merely
what
ordinary
respectable
commonplace
people
would
be
if
they
had
not
got
enough
to
eat
when
private
property
is
abolished
there
will
be
no
necessity
for
crime
no
demand
for
it
it
will
cease
to
exist
of
course
all
crimes
are
not
crimes
against
property
though
such
are
the
crimes
that
the
english
law
valuing
what
a
man
has
more
than
what
a
man
is
punishes
with
the
harshest
and
most
horrible
severity
if
we
except
the
crime
of
murder
and
regard
death
as
worse
than
penal
servitude
a
point
on
which
our
criminals
i
believe
disagree
but
though
a
crime
may
not
be
against
property
it
may
spring
from
the
misery
and
rage
and
depression
produced
by
our
wrong
system
of
and
so
when
that
system
is
abolished
will
disappear
when
each
member
of
the
community
has
sufficient
for
his
wants
and
is
not
interfered
with
by
his
neighbour
it
will
not
be
an
object
of
any
interest
to
him
to
interfere
with
anyone
else
jealousy
which
is
an
extraordinary
source
of
crime
in
modern
life
is
an
emotion
closely
bound
up
with
our
conceptions
of
property
and
under
socialism
and
individualism
will
die
out
it
is
remarkable
that
in
communistic
tribes
jealousy
is
entirely
unknown
now
as
the
state
is
not
to
govern
it
may
be
asked
what
the
state
is
to
do
the
state
is
to
be
a
voluntary
association
that
will
organise
labour
and
be
the
manufacturer
and
distributor
of
necessary
commodities
the
state
is
to
make
what
is
useful
the
individual
is
to
make
what
is
beautiful
and
as
i
have
mentioned
the
word
labour
i
can
not
help
saying
that
a
great
deal
of
nonsense
is
being
written
and
talked
nowadays
about
the
dignity
of
manual
labour
there
is
nothing
necessarily
dignified
about
manual
labour
at
all
and
most
of
it
is
absolutely
degrading
it
is
mentally
and
morally
injurious
to
man
to
do
anything
in
which
he
does
not
find
pleasure
and
many
forms
of
labour
are
quite
pleasureless
activities
and
should
be
regarded
as
such
to
sweep
a
slushy
crossing
for
eight
hours
on
a
day
when
the
east
wind
is
blowing
is
a
disgusting
occupation
to
sweep
it
with
mental
moral
or
physical
dignity
seems
to
me
to
be
impossible
to
sweep
it
with
joy
would
be
appalling
man
is
made
for
something
better
than
disturbing
dirt
all
work
of
that
kind
should
be
done
by
a
machine
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
will
be
so
up
to
the
present
man
has
been
to
a
certain
extent
the
slave
of
machinery
and
there
is
something
tragic
in
the
fact
that
as
soon
as
man
had
invented
a
machine
to
do
his
work
he
began
to
starve
this
however
is
of
course
the
result
of
our
property
system
and
our
system
of
competition
one
man
owns
a
machine
which
does
the
work
of
five
hundred
men
five
hundred
men
are
in
consequence
thrown
out
of
employment
and
having
no
work
to
do
become
hungry
and
take
to
thieving
the
one
man
secures
the
produce
of
the
machine
and
keeps
it
and
has
five
hundred
times
as
much
as
he
should
have
and
probably
which
is
of
much
more
importance
a
great
deal
more
than
he
really
wants
were
that
machine
the
property
of
all
every
one
would
benefit
by
it
it
would
be
an
immense
advantage
to
the
community
all
unintellectual
labour
all
monotonous
dull
labour
all
labour
that
deals
with
dreadful
things
and
involves
unpleasant
conditions
must
be
done
by
machinery
machinery
must
work
for
us
in
coal
mines
and
do
all
sanitary
services
and
be
the
stoker
of
steamers
and
clean
the
streets
and
run
messages
on
wet
days
and
do
anything
that
is
tedious
or
distressing
at
present
machinery
competes
against
man
under
proper
conditions
machinery
will
serve
man
there
is
no
doubt
at
all
that
this
is
the
future
of
machinery
and
just
as
trees
grow
while
the
country
gentleman
is
asleep
so
while
humanity
will
be
amusing
itself
or
enjoying
cultivated
and
not
labour
is
the
aim
of
making
beautiful
things
or
reading
beautiful
things
or
simply
contemplating
the
world
with
admiration
and
delight
machinery
will
be
doing
all
the
necessary
and
unpleasant
work
the
fact
is
that
civilisation
requires
slaves
the
greeks
were
quite
right
there
unless
there
are
slaves
to
do
the
ugly
horrible
uninteresting
work
culture
and
contemplation
become
almost
impossible
human
slavery
is
wrong
insecure
and
demoralising
on
mechanical
slavery
on
the
slavery
of
the
machine
the
future
of
the
world
depends
and
when
scientific
men
are
no
longer
called
upon
to
go
down
to
a
depressing
east
end
and
distribute
bad
cocoa
and
worse
blankets
to
starving
people
they
will
have
delightful
leisure
in
which
to
devise
wonderful
and
marvellous
things
for
their
own
joy
and
the
joy
of
everyone
else
there
will
be
great
storages
of
force
for
every
city
and
for
every
house
if
required
and
this
force
man
will
convert
into
heat
light
or
motion
according
to
his
needs
is
this
utopian
a
map
of
the
world
that
does
not
include
utopia
is
not
worth
even
glancing
at
for
it
leaves
out
the
one
country
at
which
humanity
is
always
landing
and
when
humanity
lands
there
it
looks
out
and
seeing
a
better
country
sets
sail
progress
is
the
realisation
of
utopias
now
i
have
said
that
the
community
by
means
of
organisation
of
machinery
will
supply
the
useful
things
and
that
the
beautiful
things
will
be
made
by
the
individual
this
is
not
merely
necessary
but
it
is
the
only
possible
way
by
which
we
can
get
either
the
one
or
the
other
an
individual
who
has
to
make
things
for
the
use
of
others
and
with
reference
to
their
wants
and
their
wishes
does
not
work
with
interest
and
consequently
can
not
put
into
his
work
what
is
best
in
him
upon
the
other
hand
whenever
a
community
or
a
powerful
section
of
a
community
or
a
government
of
any
kind
attempts
to
dictate
to
the
artist
what
he
is
to
do
art
either
entirely
vanishes
or
becomes
stereotyped
or
degenerates
into
a
low
and
ignoble
form
of
craft
a
work
of
art
is
the
unique
result
of
a
unique
temperament
its
beauty
comes
from
the
fact
that
the
author
is
what
he
is
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
that
other
people
want
what
they
want
indeed
the
moment
that
an
artist
takes
notice
of
what
other
people
want
and
tries
to
supply
the
demand
he
ceases
to
be
an
artist
and
becomes
a
dull
or
an
amusing
craftsman
an
honest
or
a
dishonest
tradesman
he
has
no
further
claim
to
be
considered
as
an
artist
art
is
the
most
intense
mode
of
individualism
that
the
world
has
known
i
am
inclined
to
say
that
it
is
the
only
real
mode
of
individualism
that
the
world
has
known
crime
which
under
certain
conditions
may
seem
to
have
created
individualism
must
take
cognisance
of
other
people
and
interfere
with
them
it
belongs
to
the
sphere
of
action
but
alone
without
any
reference
to
his
neighbours
without
any
interference
the
artist
can
fashion
a
beautiful
thing
and
if
he
does
not
do
it
solely
for
his
own
pleasure
he
is
not
an
artist
at
all
and
it
is
to
be
noted
that
it
is
the
fact
that
art
is
this
intense
form
of
individualism
that
makes
the
public
try
to
exercise
over
it
in
an
authority
that
is
as
immoral
as
it
is
ridiculous
and
as
corrupting
as
it
is
contemptible
it
is
not
quite
their
fault
the
public
has
always
and
in
every
age
been
badly
brought
up
they
are
continually
asking
art
to
be
popular
to
please
their
want
of
taste
to
flatter
their
absurd
vanity
to
tell
them
what
they
have
been
told
before
to
show
them
what
they
ought
to
be
tired
of
seeing
to
amuse
them
when
they
feel
heavy
after
eating
too
much
and
to
distract
their
thoughts
when
they
are
wearied
of
their
own
stupidity
now
art
should
never
try
to
be
popular
the
public
should
try
to
make
itself
artistic
there
is
a
very
wide
difference
if
a
man
of
science
were
told
that
the
results
of
his
experiments
and
the
conclusions
that
he
arrived
at
should
be
of
such
a
character
that
they
would
not
upset
the
received
popular
notions
on
the
subject
or
disturb
popular
prejudice
or
hurt
the
sensibilities
of
people
who
knew
nothing
about
science
if
a
philosopher
were
told
that
he
had
a
perfect
right
to
speculate
in
the
highest
spheres
of
thought
provided
that
he
arrived
at
the
same
conclusions
as
were
held
by
those
who
had
never
thought
in
any
sphere
at
nowadays
the
man
of
science
and
the
philosopher
would
be
considerably
amused
yet
it
is
really
a
very
few
years
since
both
philosophy
and
science
were
subjected
to
brutal
popular
control
to
authority
in
authority
of
either
the
general
ignorance
of
the
community
or
the
terror
and
greed
for
power
of
an
ecclesiastical
or
governmental
class
of
course
we
have
to
a
very
great
extent
got
rid
of
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
community
or
the
church
or
the
government
to
interfere
with
the
individualism
of
speculative
thought
but
the
attempt
to
interfere
with
the
individualism
of
imaginative
art
still
lingers
in
fact
it
does
more
than
linger
it
is
aggressive
offensive
and
brutalising
in
england
the
arts
that
have
escaped
best
are
the
arts
in
which
the
public
take
no
interest
poetry
is
an
instance
of
what
i
mean
we
have
been
able
to
have
fine
poetry
in
england
because
the
public
do
not
read
it
and
consequently
do
not
influence
it
the
public
like
to
insult
poets
because
they
are
individual
but
once
they
have
insulted
them
they
leave
them
alone
in
the
case
of
the
novel
and
the
drama
arts
in
which
the
public
do
take
an
interest
the
result
of
the
exercise
of
popular
authority
has
been
absolutely
ridiculous
no
country
produces
such
fiction
such
tedious
common
work
in
the
novel
form
such
silly
vulgar
plays
as
england
it
must
necessarily
be
so
the
popular
standard
is
of
such
a
character
that
no
artist
can
get
to
it
it
is
at
once
too
easy
and
too
difficult
to
be
a
popular
novelist
it
is
too
easy
because
the
requirements
of
the
public
as
far
as
plot
style
psychology
treatment
of
life
and
treatment
of
literature
are
concerned
are
within
the
reach
of
the
very
meanest
capacity
and
the
most
uncultivated
mind
it
is
too
difficult
because
to
meet
such
requirements
the
artist
would
have
to
do
violence
to
his
temperament
would
have
to
write
not
for
the
artistic
joy
of
writing
but
for
the
amusement
of
people
and
so
would
have
to
suppress
his
individualism
forget
his
culture
annihilate
his
style
and
surrender
everything
that
is
valuable
in
him
in
the
case
of
the
drama
things
are
a
little
better
the
public
like
the
obvious
it
is
true
but
they
do
not
like
the
tedious
and
burlesque
and
farcical
comedy
the
two
most
popular
forms
are
distinct
forms
of
art
delightful
work
may
be
produced
under
burlesque
and
farcical
conditions
and
in
work
of
this
kind
the
artist
in
england
is
allowed
very
great
freedom
it
is
when
one
comes
to
the
higher
forms
of
the
drama
that
the
result
of
popular
control
is
seen
the
one
thing
that
the
public
dislike
is
novelty
any
attempt
to
extend
the
of
art
is
extremely
distasteful
to
the
public
and
yet
the
vitality
and
progress
of
art
depend
in
a
large
measure
on
the
continual
extension
of
the
public
dislike
novelty
because
they
are
afraid
of
it
it
represents
to
them
a
mode
of
individualism
an
assertion
on
the
part
of
the
artist
that
he
selects
his
own
subject
and
treats
it
as
he
chooses
the
public
are
quite
right
in
their
attitude
art
is
individualism
and
individualism
is
a
disturbing
and
disintegrating
force
therein
lies
its
immense
value
for
what
it
seeks
to
disturb
is
monotony
of
type
slavery
of
custom
tyranny
of
habit
and
the
reduction
of
man
to
the
level
of
a
machine
in
art
the
public
accept
what
has
been
because
they
can
not
alter
it
not
because
they
appreciate
it
they
swallow
their
classics
whole
and
never
taste
them
they
endure
them
as
the
inevitable
and
as
they
can
not
mar
them
they
mouth
about
them
strangely
enough
or
not
strangely
according
to
own
views
this
acceptance
of
the
classics
does
a
great
deal
of
harm
the
uncritical
admiration
of
the
bible
and
shakespeare
in
england
is
an
instance
of
what
i
mean
with
regard
to
the
bible
considerations
of
ecclesiastical
authority
enter
into
the
matter
so
that
i
need
not
dwell
upon
the
point
but
in
the
case
of
shakespeare
it
is
quite
obvious
that
the
public
really
see
neither
the
beauties
nor
the
defects
of
his
plays
if
they
saw
the
beauties
they
would
not
object
to
the
development
of
the
drama
and
if
they
saw
the
defects
they
would
not
object
to
the
development
of
the
drama
either
the
fact
is
the
public
make
use
of
the
classics
of
a
country
as
a
means
of
checking
the
progress
of
art
they
degrade
the
classics
into
authorities
they
use
them
as
bludgeons
for
preventing
the
free
expression
of
beauty
in
new
forms
they
are
always
asking
a
writer
why
he
does
not
write
like
somebody
else
or
a
painter
why
he
does
not
paint
like
somebody
else
quite
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
if
either
of
them
did
anything
of
the
kind
he
would
cease
to
be
an
artist
a
fresh
mode
of
beauty
is
absolutely
distasteful
to
them
and
whenever
it
appears
they
get
so
angry
and
bewildered
that
they
always
use
two
stupid
is
that
the
work
of
art
is
grossly
unintelligible
the
other
that
the
work
of
art
is
grossly
immoral
what
they
mean
by
these
words
seems
to
me
to
be
this
when
they
say
a
work
is
grossly
unintelligible
they
mean
that
the
artist
has
said
or
made
a
beautiful
thing
that
is
new
when
they
describe
a
work
as
grossly
immoral
they
mean
that
the
artist
has
said
or
made
a
beautiful
thing
that
is
true
the
former
expression
has
reference
to
style
the
latter
to
but
they
probably
use
the
words
very
vaguely
as
an
ordinary
mob
will
use
there
is
not
a
single
real
poet
or
of
this
century
for
instance
on
whom
the
british
public
have
not
solemnly
conferred
diplomas
of
immorality
and
these
diplomas
practically
take
the
place
with
us
of
what
in
france
is
the
formal
recognition
of
an
academy
of
letters
and
fortunately
make
the
establishment
of
such
an
institution
quite
unnecessary
in
england
of
course
the
public
are
very
reckless
in
their
use
of
the
word
that
they
should
have
called
wordsworth
an
immoral
poet
was
only
to
be
expected
wordsworth
was
a
poet
but
that
they
should
have
called
charles
kingsley
an
immoral
novelist
is
extraordinary
prose
was
not
of
a
very
fine
quality
still
there
is
the
word
and
they
use
it
as
best
they
can
an
artist
is
of
course
not
disturbed
by
it
the
true
artist
is
a
man
who
believes
absolutely
in
himself
because
he
is
absolutely
himself
but
i
can
fancy
that
if
an
artist
produced
a
work
of
art
in
england
that
immediately
on
its
appearance
was
recognised
by
the
public
through
their
medium
which
is
the
public
press
as
a
work
that
was
quite
intelligible
and
highly
moral
he
would
begin
to
seriously
question
whether
in
its
creation
he
had
really
been
himself
at
all
and
consequently
whether
the
work
was
not
quite
unworthy
of
him
and
either
of
a
thoroughly
order
or
of
no
artistic
value
whatsoever
perhaps
however
i
have
wronged
the
public
in
limiting
them
to
such
words
as
and
there
is
one
other
word
that
they
use
that
word
is
they
do
not
use
it
often
the
meaning
of
the
word
is
so
simple
that
they
are
afraid
of
using
it
still
they
use
it
sometimes
and
now
and
then
one
comes
across
it
in
popular
newspapers
it
is
of
course
a
ridiculous
word
to
apply
to
a
work
of
art
for
what
is
morbidity
but
a
mood
of
emotion
or
a
mode
of
thought
that
one
can
not
express
the
public
are
all
morbid
because
the
public
can
never
find
expression
for
anything
the
artist
is
never
morbid
he
expresses
everything
he
stands
outside
his
subject
and
through
its
medium
produces
incomparable
and
artistic
effects
to
call
an
artist
morbid
because
he
deals
with
morbidity
as
his
is
as
silly
as
if
one
called
shakespeare
mad
because
he
wrote
on
the
whole
an
artist
in
england
gains
something
by
being
attacked
his
individuality
is
intensified
he
becomes
more
completely
himself
of
course
the
attacks
are
very
gross
very
impertinent
and
very
contemptible
but
then
no
artist
expects
grace
from
the
vulgar
mind
or
style
from
the
suburban
intellect
vulgarity
and
stupidity
are
two
very
vivid
facts
in
modern
life
one
regrets
them
naturally
but
there
they
are
they
are
subjects
for
study
like
everything
else
and
it
is
only
fair
to
state
with
regard
to
modern
journalists
that
they
always
apologise
to
one
in
private
for
what
they
have
written
against
one
in
public
within
the
last
few
years
two
other
adjectives
it
may
be
mentioned
have
been
added
to
the
very
limited
vocabulary
of
that
is
at
the
disposal
of
the
public
one
is
the
word
the
other
is
the
word
the
latter
merely
expresses
the
rage
of
the
momentary
mushroom
against
the
immortal
entrancing
and
exquisitely
lovely
orchid
it
is
a
tribute
but
a
tribute
of
no
importance
the
word
however
admits
of
analysis
it
is
a
rather
interesting
word
in
fact
it
is
so
interesting
that
the
people
who
use
it
do
not
know
what
it
means
what
does
it
mean
what
is
a
healthy
or
an
unhealthy
work
of
art
all
terms
that
one
applies
to
a
work
of
art
provided
that
one
applies
them
rationally
have
reference
to
either
its
style
or
its
subject
or
to
both
together
from
the
point
of
view
of
style
a
healthy
work
of
art
is
one
whose
style
recognises
the
beauty
of
the
material
it
employs
be
that
material
one
of
words
or
of
bronze
of
colour
or
of
ivory
and
uses
that
beauty
as
a
factor
in
producing
the
æsthetic
effect
from
the
point
of
view
of
subject
a
healthy
work
of
art
is
one
the
choice
of
whose
subject
is
conditioned
by
the
temperament
of
the
artist
and
comes
directly
out
of
it
in
fine
a
healthy
work
of
art
is
one
that
has
both
perfection
and
personality
of
course
form
and
substance
can
not
be
separated
in
a
work
of
art
they
are
always
one
but
for
purposes
of
analysis
and
setting
the
wholeness
of
æsthetic
impression
aside
for
a
moment
we
can
intellectually
so
separate
them
an
unhealthy
work
of
art
on
the
other
hand
is
a
work
whose
style
is
obvious
and
common
and
whose
subject
is
deliberately
chosen
not
because
the
artist
has
any
pleasure
in
it
but
because
he
thinks
that
the
public
will
pay
him
for
it
in
fact
the
popular
novel
that
the
public
calls
healthy
is
always
a
thoroughly
unhealthy
production
and
what
the
public
call
an
unhealthy
novel
is
always
a
beautiful
and
healthy
work
of
art
i
need
hardly
say
that
i
am
not
for
a
single
moment
complaining
that
the
public
and
the
public
press
misuse
these
words
i
do
not
see
how
with
their
lack
of
comprehension
of
what
art
is
they
could
possibly
use
them
in
the
proper
sense
i
am
merely
pointing
out
the
misuse
and
as
for
the
origin
of
the
misuse
and
the
meaning
that
lies
behind
it
all
the
explanation
is
very
simple
it
comes
from
the
barbarous
conception
of
authority
it
comes
from
the
natural
inability
of
a
community
corrupted
by
authority
to
understand
or
appreciate
individualism
in
a
word
it
comes
from
that
monstrous
and
ignorant
thing
that
is
called
public
opinion
which
bad
and
as
it
is
when
it
tries
to
control
action
is
infamous
and
of
evil
meaning
when
it
tries
to
control
thought
or
art
indeed
there
is
much
more
to
be
said
in
favour
of
the
physical
force
of
the
public
than
there
is
in
favour
of
the
opinion
the
former
may
be
fine
the
latter
must
be
foolish
it
is
often
said
that
force
is
no
argument
that
however
entirely
depends
on
what
one
wants
to
prove
many
of
the
most
important
problems
of
the
last
few
centuries
such
as
the
continuance
of
personal
government
in
england
or
of
feudalism
in
france
have
been
solved
entirely
by
means
of
physical
force
the
very
violence
of
a
revolution
may
make
the
public
grand
and
splendid
for
a
moment
it
was
a
fatal
day
when
the
public
discovered
that
the
pen
is
mightier
than
the
and
can
be
made
as
offensive
as
the
brickbat
they
at
once
sought
for
the
journalist
found
him
developed
him
and
made
him
their
industrious
and
servant
it
is
greatly
to
be
regretted
for
both
their
sakes
behind
the
barricade
there
may
be
much
that
is
noble
and
heroic
but
what
is
there
behind
the
but
prejudice
stupidity
cant
and
twaddle
and
when
these
four
are
joined
together
they
make
a
terrible
force
and
constitute
the
new
authority
in
old
days
men
had
the
rack
now
they
have
the
press
that
is
an
improvement
certainly
but
still
it
is
very
bad
and
wrong
and
demoralising
it
burke
journalism
the
fourth
estate
that
was
true
at
the
time
no
doubt
but
at
the
present
moment
it
really
is
the
only
estate
it
has
eaten
up
the
other
three
the
lords
temporal
say
nothing
the
lords
spiritual
have
nothing
to
say
and
the
house
of
commons
has
nothing
to
say
and
says
it
we
are
dominated
by
journalism
in
america
the
president
reigns
for
four
years
and
journalism
governs
for
ever
and
ever
fortunately
in
america
journalism
has
carried
its
authority
to
the
grossest
and
most
brutal
extreme
as
a
natural
consequence
it
has
begun
to
create
a
spirit
of
revolt
people
are
amused
by
it
or
disgusted
by
it
according
to
their
temperaments
but
it
is
no
longer
the
real
force
it
was
it
is
not
seriously
treated
in
england
journalism
not
except
in
a
few
instances
having
been
carried
to
such
excesses
of
brutality
is
still
a
great
factor
a
really
remarkable
power
the
tyranny
that
it
proposes
to
exercise
over
private
lives
seems
to
me
to
be
quite
extraordinary
the
fact
is
that
the
public
have
an
insatiable
curiosity
to
know
everything
except
what
is
worth
knowing
journalism
conscious
of
this
and
having
habits
supplies
their
demands
in
centuries
before
ours
the
public
nailed
the
ears
of
journalists
to
the
pump
that
was
quite
hideous
in
this
century
journalists
have
nailed
their
own
ears
to
the
keyhole
that
is
much
worse
and
what
aggravates
the
mischief
is
that
the
journalists
who
are
most
to
blame
are
not
the
amusing
journalists
who
write
for
what
are
called
society
papers
the
harm
is
done
by
the
serious
thoughtful
earnest
journalists
who
solemnly
as
they
are
doing
at
present
will
drag
before
the
eyes
of
the
public
some
incident
in
the
private
life
of
a
great
statesman
of
a
man
who
is
a
leader
of
political
thought
as
he
is
a
creator
of
political
force
and
invite
the
public
to
discuss
the
incident
to
exercise
authority
in
the
matter
to
give
their
views
and
not
merely
to
give
their
views
but
to
carry
them
into
action
to
dictate
to
the
man
upon
all
other
points
to
dictate
to
his
party
to
dictate
to
his
country
in
fact
to
make
themselves
ridiculous
offensive
and
harmful
the
private
lives
of
men
and
women
should
not
be
told
to
the
public
the
public
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
at
all
in
france
they
manage
these
things
better
there
they
do
not
allow
the
details
of
the
trials
that
take
place
in
the
divorce
courts
to
be
published
for
the
amusement
or
criticism
of
the
public
all
that
the
public
are
allowed
to
know
is
that
the
divorce
has
taken
place
and
was
granted
on
petition
of
one
or
other
or
both
of
the
married
parties
concerned
in
france
in
fact
they
limit
the
journalist
and
allow
the
artist
almost
perfect
freedom
here
we
allow
absolute
freedom
to
the
journalist
and
entirely
limit
the
artist
english
public
opinion
that
is
to
say
tries
to
constrain
and
impede
and
warp
the
man
who
makes
things
that
are
beautiful
in
effect
and
compels
the
journalist
to
retail
things
that
are
ugly
or
disgusting
or
revolting
in
fact
so
that
we
have
the
most
serious
journalists
in
the
world
and
the
most
indecent
newspapers
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
talk
of
compulsion
there
are
possibly
some
journalists
who
take
a
real
pleasure
in
publishing
horrible
things
or
who
being
poor
look
to
scandals
as
forming
a
sort
of
permanent
basis
for
an
income
but
there
are
other
journalists
i
feel
certain
men
of
education
and
cultivation
who
really
dislike
publishing
these
things
who
know
that
it
is
wrong
to
do
so
and
only
do
it
because
the
unhealthy
conditions
under
which
their
occupation
is
carried
on
oblige
them
to
supply
the
public
with
what
the
public
wants
and
to
compete
with
other
journalists
in
making
that
supply
as
full
and
satisfying
to
the
gross
popular
appetite
as
possible
it
is
a
very
degrading
position
for
any
body
of
educated
men
to
be
placed
in
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
most
of
them
feel
it
acutely
however
let
us
leave
what
is
really
a
very
sordid
side
of
the
subject
and
return
to
the
question
of
popular
control
in
the
matter
of
art
by
which
i
mean
public
opinion
dictating
to
the
artist
the
form
which
he
is
to
use
the
mode
in
which
he
is
to
use
it
and
the
materials
with
which
he
is
to
work
i
have
pointed
out
that
the
arts
which
have
escaped
best
in
england
are
the
arts
in
which
the
public
have
not
been
interested
they
are
however
interested
in
the
drama
and
as
a
certain
advance
has
been
made
in
the
drama
within
the
last
ten
or
fifteen
years
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
this
advance
is
entirely
due
to
a
few
individual
artists
refusing
to
accept
the
popular
want
of
taste
as
their
standard
and
refusing
to
regard
art
as
a
mere
matter
of
demand
and
supply
with
his
marvellous
and
vivid
personality
with
a
style
that
has
really
a
true
in
it
with
his
extraordinary
power
not
over
mere
mimicry
but
over
imaginative
and
intellectual
creation
mr
irving
had
his
sole
object
been
to
give
the
public
what
they
wanted
could
have
produced
the
commonest
plays
in
the
commonest
manner
and
made
as
much
success
and
money
as
a
man
could
possibly
desire
but
his
object
was
not
that
his
object
was
to
realise
his
own
perfection
as
an
artist
under
certain
conditions
and
in
certain
forms
of
art
at
first
he
appealed
to
the
few
now
he
has
educated
the
many
he
has
created
in
the
public
both
taste
and
temperament
the
public
appreciate
his
artistic
success
immensely
i
often
wonder
however
whether
the
public
understand
that
that
success
is
entirely
due
to
the
fact
that
he
did
not
accept
their
standard
but
realised
his
own
with
their
standard
the
lyceum
would
have
been
a
sort
of
booth
as
some
of
the
popular
theatres
in
london
are
at
present
whether
they
understand
it
or
not
the
fact
however
remains
that
taste
and
temperament
have
to
a
certain
extent
been
created
in
the
public
and
that
the
public
is
capable
of
developing
these
qualities
the
problem
then
is
why
do
not
the
public
become
more
civilised
they
have
the
capacity
what
stops
them
the
thing
that
stops
them
it
must
be
said
again
is
their
desire
to
exercise
authority
over
the
artist
and
over
works
of
art
to
certain
theatres
such
as
the
lyceum
and
the
haymarket
the
public
seem
to
come
in
a
proper
mood
in
both
of
these
theatres
there
have
been
individual
artists
who
have
succeeded
in
creating
in
their
every
theatre
in
london
has
its
own
temperament
to
which
art
appeals
and
what
is
that
temperament
it
is
the
temperament
of
receptivity
that
is
all
if
a
man
approaches
a
work
of
art
with
any
desire
to
exercise
authority
over
it
and
the
artist
he
approaches
it
in
such
a
spirit
that
he
can
not
receive
any
artistic
impression
from
it
at
all
the
work
of
art
is
to
dominate
the
spectator
the
spectator
is
not
to
dominate
the
work
of
art
the
spectator
is
to
be
receptive
he
is
to
be
the
violin
on
which
the
master
is
to
play
and
the
more
completely
he
can
suppress
his
own
silly
views
his
own
foolish
prejudices
his
own
absurd
ideas
of
what
art
should
be
or
should
not
be
the
more
likely
he
is
to
understand
and
appreciate
the
work
of
art
in
question
this
is
of
course
quite
obvious
in
the
case
of
the
vulgar
public
of
english
men
and
women
but
it
is
equally
true
of
what
are
called
educated
people
for
an
educated
ideas
of
art
are
drawn
naturally
from
what
art
has
been
whereas
the
new
work
of
art
is
beautiful
by
being
what
art
has
never
been
and
to
measure
it
by
the
standard
of
the
past
is
to
measure
it
by
a
standard
on
the
rejection
of
which
its
real
perfection
depends
a
temperament
capable
of
receiving
through
an
imaginative
medium
and
under
imaginative
conditions
new
and
beautiful
impressions
is
the
only
temperament
that
can
appreciate
a
work
of
art
and
true
as
this
is
in
the
case
of
the
appreciation
of
sculpture
and
painting
it
is
still
more
true
of
the
appreciation
of
such
arts
as
the
drama
for
a
picture
and
a
statue
are
not
at
war
with
time
they
take
no
count
of
its
succession
in
one
moment
their
unity
may
be
apprehended
in
the
case
of
literature
it
is
different
time
must
be
traversed
before
the
unity
of
effect
is
realised
and
so
in
the
drama
there
may
occur
in
the
first
act
of
the
play
something
whose
real
artistic
value
may
not
be
evident
to
the
spectator
till
the
third
or
fourth
act
is
reached
is
the
silly
fellow
to
get
angry
and
call
out
and
disturb
the
play
and
annoy
the
artists
no
the
honest
man
is
to
sit
quietly
and
know
the
delightful
emotions
of
wonder
curiosity
and
suspense
he
is
not
to
go
to
the
play
to
lose
a
vulgar
temper
he
is
to
go
to
the
play
to
realise
an
artistic
temperament
he
is
to
go
to
the
play
to
gain
an
artistic
temperament
he
is
not
the
arbiter
of
the
work
of
art
he
is
one
who
is
admitted
to
contemplate
the
work
of
art
and
if
the
work
be
fine
to
forget
in
its
contemplation
and
the
egotism
that
mars
egotism
of
his
ignorance
or
the
egotism
of
his
information
this
point
about
the
drama
is
hardly
i
think
sufficiently
recognised
i
can
quite
understand
that
were
produced
for
the
first
time
before
a
modern
london
audience
many
of
the
people
present
would
strongly
and
vigorously
object
to
the
introduction
of
the
witches
in
the
first
act
with
their
grotesque
phrases
and
their
ridiculous
words
but
when
the
play
is
over
one
realises
that
the
laughter
of
the
witches
in
is
as
terrible
as
the
laughter
of
madness
in
more
terrible
than
the
laughter
of
iago
in
the
tragedy
of
the
moor
no
spectator
of
art
needs
a
more
perfect
mood
of
receptivity
than
the
spectator
of
a
play
the
moment
he
seeks
to
exercise
authority
he
becomes
the
avowed
enemy
of
art
and
of
himself
art
does
not
mind
it
is
he
who
suffers
with
the
novel
it
is
the
same
thing
popular
authority
and
the
recognition
of
popular
authority
are
fatal
is
a
beautiful
work
of
art
because
he
wrote
it
to
please
himself
in
his
other
novels
in
in
in
even
at
times
he
is
too
conscious
of
the
public
and
spoils
his
work
by
appealing
directly
to
the
sympathies
of
the
public
or
by
directly
mocking
at
them
a
true
artist
takes
no
notice
whatever
of
the
public
the
public
are
to
him
he
has
no
poppied
or
honeyed
cakes
through
which
to
give
the
monster
sleep
or
sustenance
he
leaves
that
to
the
popular
novelist
one
incomparable
novelist
we
have
now
in
england
mr
george
meredith
there
are
better
artists
in
france
but
france
has
no
one
whose
view
of
life
is
so
large
so
varied
so
imaginatively
true
there
are
tellers
of
stories
in
russia
who
have
a
more
vivid
sense
of
what
pain
in
fiction
may
be
but
to
him
belongs
philosophy
in
fiction
his
people
not
merely
live
but
they
live
in
thought
one
can
see
them
from
myriad
points
of
view
they
are
suggestive
there
is
soul
in
them
and
around
them
they
are
interpretative
and
symbolic
and
he
who
made
them
those
wonderful
figures
made
them
for
his
own
pleasure
and
has
never
asked
the
public
what
they
wanted
has
never
cared
to
know
what
they
wanted
has
never
allowed
the
public
to
dictate
to
him
or
influence
him
in
any
way
but
has
gone
on
intensifying
his
own
personality
and
producing
his
own
individual
work
at
first
none
came
to
him
that
did
not
matter
then
the
few
came
to
him
that
did
not
change
him
the
many
have
come
now
he
is
still
the
same
he
is
an
incomparable
novelist
with
the
decorative
arts
it
is
not
different
the
public
clung
with
really
pathetic
tenacity
to
what
i
believe
were
the
direct
traditions
of
the
great
exhibition
of
international
vulgarity
traditions
that
were
so
appalling
that
the
houses
in
which
people
lived
were
only
fit
for
blind
people
to
live
in
beautiful
things
began
to
be
made
beautiful
colours
came
from
the
hand
beautiful
patterns
from
the
brain
and
the
use
of
beautiful
things
and
their
value
and
importance
were
set
forth
the
public
were
really
very
indignant
they
lost
their
temper
they
said
silly
things
no
one
minded
no
one
was
a
whit
the
worse
no
one
accepted
the
authority
of
public
opinion
and
now
it
is
almost
impossible
to
enter
any
modern
house
without
seeing
some
recognition
of
good
taste
some
recognition
of
the
value
of
lovely
surroundings
some
sign
of
appreciation
of
beauty
in
fact
houses
are
as
a
rule
quite
charming
nowadays
people
have
been
to
a
very
great
extent
civilised
it
is
only
fair
to
state
however
that
the
extraordinary
success
of
the
revolution
in
and
furniture
and
the
like
has
not
really
been
due
to
the
majority
of
the
public
developing
a
very
fine
taste
in
such
matters
it
has
been
chiefly
due
to
the
fact
that
the
craftsmen
of
things
so
appreciated
the
pleasure
of
making
what
was
beautiful
and
woke
to
such
a
vivid
consciousness
of
the
hideousness
and
vulgarity
of
what
the
public
had
previously
wanted
that
they
simply
starved
the
public
out
it
would
be
quite
impossible
at
the
present
moment
to
furnish
a
room
as
rooms
were
furnished
a
few
years
ago
without
going
for
everything
to
an
auction
of
furniture
from
some
the
things
are
no
longer
made
however
they
may
object
to
it
people
must
nowadays
have
something
charming
in
their
surroundings
fortunately
for
them
their
assumption
of
authority
in
these
came
to
entire
grief
it
is
evident
then
that
all
authority
in
such
things
is
bad
people
sometimes
inquire
what
form
of
government
is
most
suitable
for
an
artist
to
live
under
to
this
question
there
is
only
one
answer
the
form
of
government
that
is
most
suitable
to
the
artist
is
no
government
at
all
authority
over
him
and
his
art
is
ridiculous
it
has
been
stated
that
under
despotisms
artists
have
produced
lovely
work
this
is
not
quite
so
artists
have
visited
despots
not
as
subjects
to
be
tyrannised
over
but
as
wandering
as
fascinating
vagrant
personalities
to
be
entertained
and
charmed
and
suffered
to
be
at
peace
and
allowed
to
create
there
is
this
to
be
said
in
favour
of
the
despot
that
he
being
an
individual
may
have
culture
while
the
mob
being
a
monster
has
none
one
who
is
an
emperor
and
king
may
stoop
down
to
pick
up
a
brush
for
a
painter
but
when
the
democracy
stoops
down
it
is
merely
to
throw
mud
and
yet
the
democracy
have
not
so
far
to
stoop
as
the
emperor
in
fact
when
they
want
to
throw
mud
they
have
not
to
stoop
at
all
but
there
is
no
necessity
to
separate
the
monarch
from
the
mob
all
authority
is
equally
bad
there
are
three
kinds
of
despots
there
is
the
despot
who
tyrannises
over
the
body
there
is
the
despot
who
tyrannises
over
the
soul
there
is
the
despot
who
tyrannises
over
the
soul
and
body
alike
the
first
is
called
the
prince
the
second
is
called
the
pope
the
third
is
called
the
people
the
prince
may
be
cultivated
many
princes
have
been
yet
in
the
prince
there
is
danger
one
thinks
of
dante
at
the
bitter
feast
in
verona
of
tasso
in
cell
it
is
better
for
the
artist
not
to
live
with
princes
the
pope
may
be
cultivated
many
popes
have
been
the
bad
popes
have
been
the
bad
popes
loved
beauty
almost
as
passionately
nay
with
as
much
passion
as
the
good
popes
hated
thought
to
the
wickedness
of
the
papacy
humanity
owes
much
the
goodness
of
the
papacy
owes
a
terrible
debt
to
humanity
yet
though
the
vatican
has
kept
the
rhetoric
of
its
thunders
and
lost
the
rod
of
its
lightning
it
is
better
for
the
artist
not
to
live
with
popes
it
was
a
pope
who
said
of
cellini
to
a
conclave
of
cardinals
that
common
laws
and
common
authority
were
not
made
for
men
such
as
he
but
it
was
a
pope
who
thrust
cellini
into
prison
and
kept
him
there
till
he
sickened
with
rage
and
created
unreal
visions
for
himself
and
saw
the
gilded
sun
enter
his
room
and
grew
so
enamoured
of
it
that
he
sought
to
escape
and
crept
out
from
tower
to
tower
and
falling
through
dizzy
air
at
dawn
maimed
himself
and
was
by
a
covered
with
vine
leaves
and
carried
in
a
cart
to
one
who
loving
beautiful
things
had
care
of
him
there
is
danger
in
popes
and
as
for
the
people
what
of
them
and
their
authority
perhaps
of
them
and
their
authority
one
has
spoken
enough
their
authority
is
a
thing
blind
deaf
hideous
grotesque
tragic
amusing
serious
and
obscene
it
is
impossible
for
the
artist
to
live
with
the
people
all
despots
bribe
the
people
bribe
and
brutalise
who
told
them
to
exercise
authority
they
were
made
to
live
to
listen
and
to
love
someone
has
done
them
a
great
wrong
they
have
marred
themselves
by
imitation
of
their
inferiors
they
have
taken
the
sceptre
of
the
prince
how
should
they
use
it
they
have
taken
the
triple
tiara
of
the
pope
how
should
they
carry
its
burden
they
are
as
a
clown
whose
heart
is
broken
they
are
as
a
priest
whose
soul
is
not
yet
born
let
all
who
love
beauty
pity
them
though
they
themselves
love
not
beauty
yet
let
them
pity
themselves
who
taught
them
the
trick
of
tyranny
there
are
many
other
things
that
one
might
point
out
one
might
point
out
how
the
renaissance
was
great
because
it
sought
to
solve
no
social
problem
and
busied
itself
not
about
such
things
but
suffered
the
individual
to
develop
freely
beautifully
and
naturally
and
so
had
great
and
individual
artists
and
great
and
individual
men
one
might
point
out
how
louis
by
creating
the
modern
state
destroyed
the
individualism
of
the
artist
and
made
things
monstrous
in
their
monotony
of
repetition
and
contemptible
in
their
conformity
to
rule
and
destroyed
throughout
all
france
all
those
fine
freedoms
of
expression
that
had
made
tradition
new
in
beauty
and
new
modes
one
with
antique
form
but
the
past
is
of
no
importance
the
present
is
of
no
importance
it
is
with
the
future
that
we
have
to
deal
for
the
past
is
what
man
should
not
have
been
the
present
is
what
man
ought
not
to
be
the
future
is
what
artists
are
it
will
of
course
be
said
that
such
a
scheme
as
is
set
forth
here
is
quite
unpractical
and
goes
against
human
nature
this
is
perfectly
true
it
is
unpractical
and
it
goes
against
human
nature
this
is
why
it
is
worth
carrying
out
and
that
is
why
one
proposes
it
for
what
is
a
practical
scheme
a
practical
scheme
is
either
a
scheme
that
is
already
in
existence
or
a
scheme
that
could
be
carried
out
under
existing
conditions
but
it
is
exactly
the
existing
conditions
that
one
objects
to
and
any
scheme
that
could
accept
these
conditions
is
wrong
and
foolish
the
conditions
will
be
done
away
with
and
human
nature
will
change
the
only
thing
that
one
really
knows
about
human
nature
is
that
it
changes
change
is
the
one
quality
we
can
predicate
of
it
the
systems
that
fail
are
those
that
rely
on
the
permanency
of
human
nature
and
not
on
its
growth
and
development
the
error
of
louis
xiv
was
that
he
thought
human
nature
would
always
be
the
same
the
result
of
his
error
was
the
french
revolution
it
was
an
admirable
result
all
the
results
of
the
mistakes
of
governments
are
quite
admirable
it
is
to
be
noted
also
that
individualism
does
not
come
to
man
with
any
sickly
cant
about
duty
which
merely
means
doing
what
other
people
want
because
they
want
it
or
any
hideous
cant
about
which
is
merely
a
survival
of
savage
mutilation
in
fact
it
does
not
come
to
man
with
any
claims
upon
him
at
all
it
comes
naturally
and
inevitably
out
of
man
it
is
the
point
to
which
all
development
tends
it
is
the
differentiation
to
which
all
organisms
grow
it
is
the
perfection
that
is
inherent
in
every
mode
of
life
and
towards
which
every
mode
of
life
quickens
and
so
individualism
exercises
no
compulsion
over
man
on
the
contrary
it
says
to
man
that
he
should
suffer
no
compulsion
to
be
exercised
over
him
it
does
not
try
to
force
people
to
be
good
it
knows
that
people
are
good
when
they
are
let
alone
man
will
develop
individualism
out
of
himself
man
is
now
so
developing
individualism
to
ask
whether
individualism
is
practical
is
like
asking
whether
evolution
is
practical
evolution
is
the
law
of
life
and
there
is
no
evolution
except
towards
individualism
where
this
tendency
is
not
expressed
it
is
a
case
of
growth
or
of
disease
or
of
death
individualism
will
also
be
unselfish
and
unaffected
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
one
of
the
results
of
the
extraordinary
tyranny
of
authority
is
that
words
are
absolutely
distorted
from
their
proper
and
simple
meaning
and
are
used
to
express
the
obverse
of
their
right
signification
what
is
true
about
art
is
true
about
life
a
man
is
called
affected
nowadays
if
he
dresses
as
he
likes
to
dress
but
in
doing
that
he
is
acting
in
a
perfectly
natural
manner
affectation
in
such
matters
consists
in
dressing
according
to
the
views
of
neighbour
whose
views
as
they
are
the
views
of
the
majority
will
probably
be
extremely
stupid
or
a
man
is
called
selfish
if
he
lives
in
the
manner
that
seems
to
him
most
suitable
for
the
full
realisation
of
his
own
personality
if
in
fact
the
primary
aim
of
his
life
is
but
this
is
the
way
in
which
everyone
should
live
selfishness
is
not
living
as
one
wishes
to
live
it
is
asking
others
to
live
as
one
wishes
to
live
and
unselfishness
is
letting
other
lives
alone
not
interfering
with
them
selfishness
always
aims
at
creating
around
it
an
absolute
uniformity
of
type
unselfishness
recognises
infinite
variety
of
type
as
a
delightful
thing
accepts
it
acquiesces
in
it
enjoys
it
it
is
not
selfish
to
think
for
oneself
a
man
who
does
not
think
for
himself
does
not
think
at
all
it
is
grossly
selfish
to
require
of
ones
neighbour
that
he
should
think
in
the
same
way
and
hold
the
same
opinions
why
should
he
if
he
can
think
he
will
probably
think
differently
if
he
can
not
think
it
is
monstrous
to
require
thought
of
any
kind
from
him
a
red
rose
is
not
selfish
because
it
wants
to
be
a
red
rose
it
would
be
horribly
selfish
if
it
wanted
all
the
other
flowers
in
the
garden
to
be
both
red
and
roses
under
individualism
people
will
be
quite
natural
and
absolutely
unselfish
and
will
know
the
meanings
of
the
words
and
realise
them
in
their
free
beautiful
lives
nor
will
men
be
egotistic
as
they
are
now
for
the
egotist
is
he
who
makes
claims
upon
others
and
the
individualist
will
not
desire
to
do
that
it
will
not
give
him
pleasure
when
man
has
realised
individualism
he
will
also
realise
sympathy
and
exercise
it
freely
and
spontaneously
up
to
the
present
man
has
hardly
cultivated
sympathy
at
all
he
has
merely
sympathy
with
pain
and
sympathy
with
pain
is
not
the
highest
form
of
sympathy
all
sympathy
is
fine
but
sympathy
with
suffering
is
the
least
fine
mode
it
is
tainted
with
egotism
it
is
apt
to
become
morbid
there
is
in
it
a
certain
element
of
terror
for
our
own
safety
we
become
afraid
that
we
ourselves
might
be
as
the
leper
or
as
the
blind
and
that
no
man
would
have
care
of
us
it
is
curiously
limiting
too
one
should
sympathise
with
the
entirety
of
life
not
with
sores
and
maladies
merely
but
with
joy
and
beauty
and
energy
and
health
and
freedom
the
wider
sympathy
is
of
course
the
more
difficult
it
requires
more
unselfishness
anybody
can
sympathise
with
the
sufferings
of
a
friend
but
it
requires
a
very
fine
requires
in
fact
the
nature
of
a
true
sympathise
with
a
success
in
the
modern
stress
of
competition
and
struggle
for
place
such
sympathy
is
naturally
rare
and
is
also
very
much
stifled
by
the
immoral
ideal
of
uniformity
of
type
and
conformity
to
rule
which
is
so
prevalent
everywhere
and
is
perhaps
most
obnoxious
in
england
sympathy
with
pain
there
will
of
course
always
be
it
is
one
of
the
first
instincts
of
man
the
animals
which
are
individual
the
higher
animals
that
is
to
say
share
it
with
us
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
while
sympathy
with
joy
intensifies
the
sum
of
joy
in
the
world
sympathy
with
pain
does
not
really
diminish
the
amount
of
pain
it
may
make
man
better
able
to
endure
evil
but
the
evil
remains
sympathy
with
consumption
does
not
cure
consumption
that
is
what
science
does
and
when
socialism
has
solved
the
problem
of
poverty
and
science
solved
the
problem
of
disease
the
area
of
the
sentimentalists
will
be
lessened
and
the
sympathy
of
man
will
be
large
healthy
and
spontaneous
man
will
have
joy
in
the
contemplation
of
the
joyous
life
of
others
for
it
is
through
joy
that
the
individualism
of
the
future
will
develop
itself
christ
made
no
attempt
to
reconstruct
society
and
consequently
the
individualism
that
he
preached
to
man
could
be
realised
only
through
pain
or
in
solitude
the
ideals
that
we
owe
to
christ
are
the
ideals
of
the
man
who
abandons
society
entirely
or
of
the
man
who
resists
society
absolutely
but
man
is
naturally
social
even
the
thebaid
became
peopled
at
last
and
though
the
cenobite
realises
his
personality
it
is
often
an
impoverished
personality
that
he
so
realises
upon
the
other
hand
the
terrible
truth
that
pain
is
a
mode
through
which
man
may
realise
himself
exercises
a
wonderful
fascination
over
the
world
shallow
speakers
and
shallow
thinkers
in
pulpits
and
on
platforms
often
talk
about
the
worship
of
pleasure
and
whine
against
it
but
it
is
rarely
in
the
history
that
its
ideal
has
been
one
of
joy
and
beauty
the
worship
of
pain
has
far
more
often
dominated
the
world
mediævalism
with
its
saints
and
martyrs
its
love
of
its
wild
passion
for
wounding
itself
its
gashing
with
knives
and
its
whipping
with
is
real
christianity
and
the
mediæval
christ
is
the
real
christ
when
the
renaissance
dawned
upon
the
world
and
brought
with
it
the
new
ideals
of
the
beauty
of
life
and
the
joy
of
living
men
could
not
understand
christ
even
art
shows
us
that
the
painters
of
the
renaissance
drew
christ
as
a
little
boy
playing
with
another
boy
in
a
palace
or
a
garden
or
lying
back
in
his
arms
smiling
at
her
or
at
a
flower
or
at
a
bright
bird
or
as
a
noble
stately
figure
moving
nobly
through
the
world
or
as
a
wonderful
figure
rising
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
from
death
to
life
even
when
they
drew
him
crucified
they
drew
him
as
a
beautiful
god
on
whom
evil
men
had
inflicted
suffering
but
he
did
not
preoccupy
them
much
what
delighted
them
was
to
paint
the
men
and
women
whom
they
admired
and
to
show
the
loveliness
of
this
lovely
earth
they
painted
many
religious
fact
they
painted
far
too
many
and
the
monotony
of
type
and
motive
is
wearisome
and
was
bad
for
art
it
was
the
result
of
the
authority
of
the
public
in
and
is
to
be
deplored
but
their
soul
was
not
in
the
subject
raphael
was
a
great
artist
when
he
painted
his
portrait
of
the
pope
when
he
painted
his
madonnas
and
infant
christs
he
is
not
a
great
artist
at
all
christ
had
no
message
for
the
renaissance
which
was
wonderful
because
it
brought
an
ideal
at
variance
with
his
and
to
find
the
presentation
of
the
real
christ
we
must
go
to
mediæval
art
there
he
is
one
maimed
and
marred
one
who
is
not
comely
to
look
on
because
beauty
is
a
joy
one
who
is
not
in
fair
raiment
because
that
may
be
a
joy
also
he
is
a
beggar
who
has
a
marvellous
soul
he
is
a
leper
whose
soul
is
divine
he
needs
neither
property
nor
health
he
is
a
god
realising
his
perfection
through
pain
the
evolution
of
man
is
slow
the
injustice
of
men
is
great
it
was
necessary
that
pain
should
be
put
forward
as
a
mode
of
even
now
in
some
places
in
the
world
the
message
of
christ
is
necessary
no
one
who
lived
in
modern
russia
could
possibly
realise
his
perfection
except
by
pain
a
few
russian
artists
have
realised
themselves
in
art
in
a
fiction
that
is
mediæval
in
character
because
its
dominant
note
is
the
realisation
of
men
through
suffering
but
for
those
who
are
not
artists
and
to
whom
there
is
no
mode
of
life
but
the
actual
life
of
fact
pain
is
the
only
door
to
perfection
a
russian
who
lives
happily
under
the
present
system
of
government
in
russia
must
either
believe
that
man
has
no
soul
or
that
if
he
has
it
is
not
worth
developing
a
nihilist
who
rejects
all
authority
because
he
knows
authority
to
be
evil
and
welcomes
all
pain
because
through
that
he
realises
his
personality
is
a
real
christian
to
him
the
christian
ideal
is
a
true
thing
and
yet
christ
did
not
revolt
against
authority
he
accepted
the
imperial
authority
of
the
roman
empire
and
paid
tribute
he
endured
the
ecclesiastical
authority
of
the
jewish
church
and
would
not
repel
its
violence
by
any
violence
of
his
own
he
had
as
i
said
before
no
scheme
for
the
reconstruction
of
society
but
the
modern
world
has
schemes
it
proposes
to
do
away
with
poverty
and
the
suffering
that
it
entails
it
desires
to
get
rid
of
pain
and
the
suffering
that
pain
entails
it
trusts
to
socialism
and
to
science
as
its
methods
what
it
aims
at
is
an
individualism
expressing
itself
through
joy
this
individualism
will
be
larger
fuller
lovelier
than
any
individualism
has
ever
been
pain
is
not
the
ultimate
mode
of
perfection
it
is
merely
provisional
and
a
protest
it
has
reference
to
wrong
unhealthy
unjust
surroundings
when
the
wrong
and
the
disease
and
the
injustice
are
removed
it
will
have
no
further
place
it
will
have
done
its
work
it
was
a
great
work
but
it
is
almost
over
its
sphere
lessens
every
day
nor
will
man
miss
it
for
what
man
has
sought
for
is
indeed
neither
pain
nor
pleasure
but
simply
life
man
has
sought
to
live
intensely
fully
perfectly
when
he
can
do
so
without
exercising
restraint
on
others
or
suffering
it
ever
and
his
activities
are
all
pleasurable
to
him
he
will
be
saner
healthier
more
civilised
more
himself
pleasure
is
test
her
sign
of
approval
when
man
is
happy
he
is
in
harmony
with
himself
and
his
environment
the
new
individualism
for
whose
service
socialism
whether
it
wills
it
or
not
is
working
will
be
perfect
harmony
it
will
be
what
the
greeks
sought
for
but
could
not
except
in
thought
realise
completely
because
they
had
slaves
and
fed
them
it
will
be
what
the
renaissance
sought
for
but
could
not
realise
completely
except
in
art
because
they
had
slaves
and
starved
them
it
will
be
complete
and
through
it
each
man
will
attain
to
his
perfection
the
new
individualism
is
the
new
hellenism
