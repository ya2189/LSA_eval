he
was
delivered
from

danger

escaped
through

camp

through

aid
of
robert

going

him
made
a
lane
with

slaying
numbers
of

turks
in

heroic
progress
towards
the
close
of

chivalric
enterprize

becoming
more
fierce
and
eager
as
he
advanced
robert
unfortunately
dropt
his
sword
and
while
stooping
to
recover
his
weapon
he
was
oppressed
by
the
multitude
who
threw
themselves
upon
him
and
made
him
prisoner
from
thence
as
some
say
robert
was
carried
to
babylon
in
egypt
or
cairo
and
refusing
to
renounce
his
faith
in
christ
he
was
tied
to
a
stake
in

transpierced
with
arrows
edgar
having

lost
his
valiant
knight
returned
towards

was
much
honoured
with
many
gifts
by
the
emperors
both
of
greece
and
germany
both
of
whom
would
gladly
have
retained
him
at
their
courts
on
account
of
his
high
lineage
but
he
despised
all
things
from

that
it
might
be
seen
of
the
christians
they
sailed
boldly
towards
joppa
with
but
a
small
company
of
armed
men
the
king
knew
that
the
christians
in
joppa
were
almost
hopeless
of
his
life
and
safety
and
he
feared
they
might
shamefully
abandon
the
defence
of
the
place
or
be
constrained
to
surrender
unless
revived
by
his
presence
on
perceiving
the
approach
of
the

of
king
baldwin
the
naval
forces
of
the

to
the
number
of
twenty

raged
against
them
while
the

glided
easily
and
swiftly
through
the
waves
eluding
the
enemy
and
arrived
in
safety
into
the
haven
of
joppa
to
the
great
joy
of
the
christians
who
had
mourned
him
as
if
dead

christians
then
besieged
in
joppa
on
the
of

in
the
second
year
of
baldwin
king
of
jerusalem
when
the
numerous
army
of
the
saracens
saw
that
the
christians
thus
reinforced
boldly
faced
them
without
the
walls
they
removed
their
tents
during
the
night
above
a
mile
from
the
town
that
they
might
consider
whether
to
retreat
to
ascalon
or
to
continue
to
harass
the
citizens
of
joppa
with
frequent
assaults
but
they
confided
in
their
numbers
and
continued
to
annoy
the
christians
by
severe
and
repeated
attacks
having
allowed
three
days
rest
and
refreshment
to
this
powerful
reinforcement

out
from
joppa

morning
of

sixth

the
martial
sound

trumpets
and
cornets
with
a
strong
force
both
of
foot
and
horse
marching
directly
toward
the
saracens
with
loud
shouts
and
attacked
their
army
with
great
spirit
the
land
attack
was
assisted
by
the
christian
navy
which
approached
the
shore
making
a
horrible
noise
and
distracting
the
attention
of
the
saracens
who
feared
to
be
attacked
in
flank
and
rear
after
a
sharp
encounter
the
saracens
fled
towards
ascalon
many
being
slain
in

and
pursuit
and
others
drowned
by
leaping
into

they

at

and
all
the

devotion
free
from

and
ambushes
of
the
gentiles
and
having
paid
their
vows
unto

they
returned
with
great
joy
and
without

to

finding
king

in

place
they
made
offer
to
assist

great
commendations
saying
that
he
could
not
give
an
immediate
answer
without
consulting
the
patriarch

therefore
called
together

every
one
of
the
nobles
to
go
home
that
they
might
provide
armour
and
all
other
necessaries
for
the
siege
he
sent
messengers
to
the
english
requiring
them
not
to
remove
their
fleet
and
army
from
joppa
but
to
wait
there
for
his
farther
commands
informing
them
that
he
and
his
nobles
had
resolved
with
their
aid
to
lay
siege

would
require
some
time
to
provide
the
necessary

answered

orders
at

promising
to
be
obedient
to
him
in
all
things

many
different
kinds

warlike
instruments

of
every

necessary
for
the

this

expedition
came

they
understood
that
a
powerful
army
of
pilgrims
lay
in
readiness
at
joppa
to
assist

tribute

happened
to
be
at
some
distance

to
come

about

assaulted

in

william
earl
of
salisbury
served
with
a
chosen
band
of
englishmen
under
his
especial
command
but
the
french
entertained
a
great
dislike
to
him
and
his
people
whom
they
flouted
upon
all
occasions
calling
them
english
and
other
opprobrious
names
insomuch
that
the
king
of
france
had
much
ado
to
keep
peace
between
them
this
quarrel
originated
from
the
following
circumstance
not
far
from
alexandria
there
was
a
strong
castle
belonging
to
the
saracens
in
which
they
had
placed
some
of
their
principal
ladies
and
much
treasure
which
fortress
the
earl
and
his
english
followers
had
the
good
fortune
to
take
more
by
dexterous
policy
than
by
open
force
of
arms
through
which
capture
he
and
his
people
were
much
enriched
and
when
the
french
came
to
the
knowledge
of
this
exploit
which
had
not
been
previously
communicated
to
them
they
were
much
enraged
against
the
english
and
could
never
speak
well
of
them
afterwards
not
long
after
this
the
earl
got
secret
intelligence
of
a
rich
caravan
of
merchants
belonging
to
the
saracens
who
were
travelling
to
a
certain
fair
which
was
to
be
held
near
alexandria
with
a
multitude
of
camels
asses
and
mules
and
many
carts
all
richly
laden
with
silks
precious
jewels
spices
gold
silver
and
other
commodities
besides
provisions
and
other
matters
of
which
the
soldiers
were
then
in
great
want
without
giving
notice
of
this
to
the
rest
of
the
christian
army
the
earl
gathered
all
the
english
troops
and
fell
by
night
upon
the
caravan
killing
many
of
the
people
and
making
himself
master
of
the
whole
carts
and
baggage
cattle
with
their
drivers
which
he
brought
with
him
to
the
christian
camp
losing
only
one
soldier
in
the
skirmish
and
eight
of
his
servants
some
of
whom
were
only
wounded
and
brought
home
to
be
cured
when
this
was
known
in
the
camp
the
frenchmen
who
had
loitered
in
their
tents
while
the
earl
and
his
people
were
engaged
in
the
expedition
came
forth
and
forcibly
took
to
themselves
the
whole
of
this
spoil
finding
great
fault
with
the
earl
and
the
english
for
leaving
the
camp
without
orders
from
the
general
contrary
to
the
discipline
of
war
though
the
earl
insisted
that
he
had
done
nothing
but
what
he
would
readily
justify
and
that
his
intentions
were
to
have
divided
the
spoil
among
the
whole
army
but
this
being
of
no
avail
and
very
much
displeased
at
being
deprived
in
so
cowardly
a
manner
of
what
he
had
so
adventurously
gained
he
made
his
complaint
to
the
king
and
being
successfully
opposed
there
by
the
pride
of
the
count
of
artois
the
kings
brother
who
thwarted
his
claims
with
disdainful
spite
he
declared
that
he
would
serve
no
longer
in
their
army
and
bidding
farewell
to
the
king
he
and
his
people
broke
up
from
the
army
and
marched
for
achon
upon
their
departure
the
count
said
that
the
french
army
was
well
rid
of
these
tailed
english
which
words
spoken
in
despite
were
ill
taken
by
many
good
men
even
of
their
own
army
but
not
long
after
when
the
governor
of
cairo
who
was
offended
with
the
soldan
offered
to
deliver
that
place
to
the
french
king
and
even
gave
him
instructions
now
he
might
best
conduct
himself
to
accomplish
that
enterprize
the
king
sent
a
message
in
all
haste
to
the
earl
of
salisbury
requesting
him
to
return
to
the
army
under
promise
of
redressing
all
his
grievances
on
which
he
came
back
and
rejoined
the
french
army
the
king
of
france
now
marched
towards
cairo
and
came
to
the
great
river
nile
on
the
other
side
of
which
the
soldan
had
encamped
with
his
army
on
purpose
to
dispute
the
passage
at
this
time
there
was
a
saracen
in
the
service
of
the
count
of
artois
who
had
been
lately
converted
to
the
christian
faith
and
who
offered
to
point
out
a
shallow
ford
in
the
river
by
which
the
army
might
easily
cross
over
upon
receiving
this
intelligence
artois
and
the
master
of
the
knights
templars
with
about
a
third
of
the
army
crossed
to
the
other
side
and
were
followed
by
salisbury
and
the
english
these
being
all
joined
made
an
assault
upon
a
part
of
the
saracen
army
which
remained
in
the
camp
and
overthrew
them
the
soldan
being
then
at
some
distance
with
the
greater
part
of
his
army
after
this
easy
victory
artois
was
so
puffed
up
with
pride
and
elated
by
success
that
he
believed
nothing
could
withstand
him
and
would
needs
advance
without
waiting
for
the
coming
up
of
the
main
body
of
the
army
under
the
king
of
france
vainly
believing
that
he
was
able
with
the
power
he
had
to
conquer
the
whole
force
of
the
saracens
the
master
of
the
templars
and
other
experienced
officers
endeavoured
to
dissuade
him
from
this
rash
conduct
advising
him
rather
to
return
to
the
main
army
satisfied
with
the
signal
advantage
he
had
already
achieved
that
thereby
the
whole
army
of
the
christians
might
act
in
concert
and
be
the
better
able
to
guard
against
the
danger
of
any
ambushes
or
other
stratagems
of
war
that
might
have
been
devised
for
their
destruction
they
represented
to
him
that
the
horses
of
this
vanguard
were
already
tired
and
the
troops
without
food
and
besides
that
their
numbers
were
utterly
unable
to
withstand
the
vastly
superior
multitude
of
the
enemy
who
besides
having
now
obviously
to
fight
for
their
last
stake
the
capital
of
their
dominions
might
be
expected
to
exert
their
utmost
efforts
to
this
salutary
counsel
the
proud
earl
arrogantly
answered
with
opprobrious
taunts
reviling
the
whole
templars
as
dastardly
cowards
and
betrayers
of
their
country
and
even
alleged
that
the
holy
land
of
the
cross
might
easily
be
won
to
christendom
if
it
were
not
for
the
rebellious
spirit
of
the
templars
and
hospitallers
and
their
followers
which
indeed
was
a
common
belief
among
many
to
these
contumelious
remarks
the
master
of
the
templars
angrily
desired
him
in
his
own
name
and
that
of
his
followers
to
display
his
ensign
when
and
where
he
dared
and
he
should
find
them
as
ready
to
follow
as
he
to
lead
the
earl
of
salisbury
now
remonstrated
with
artois
advising
him
to
listen
to
these
experienced
persons
who
were
much
better
acquainted
with
the
country
and
people
than
he
could
be
and
endeavoured
to
convince
him
that
their
advice
was
discreet
and
worthy
to
be
followed
he
then
addressed
his
discourse
to
the
master
of
the
templars
prudently
endeavouring
to
sooth
his
anger
against
the
arrogance
of
the
count
of
artois
but
artois
cut
him
short
exclaiming
in
anger
with
many
oaths
away
with
these
cowardly
englishmen
with
tails
the
army
would
be
much
better
rid
of
these
tailed
people
and
many
other
scandalous
and
disdainful
expressions
to
this
the
english
earl
replied
well
earl
robert
wherever
you
dare
set
your
foot
my
steps
shall
go
as
far
as
yours
and
i
believe
we
shall
go
this
day
where
you
shall
not
dare
to
come
near
the
tails
of
our
horses
and
it
so
happened
as
earl
william
said
for
earl
robert
of
artois
persisted
to
march
forward
against
the
soldan
vainly
hoping
to
win
all
the
glory
to
himself
before
the
coming
up
of
the
main
body
of
the
host
his
first
enterprize
was
ordering
an
attack
on
a
small
castle
or
fortified
village
called
mansor
whence
a
number
of
the
villagers
ran
out
on
seeing
the
approach
of
the
christians
making
a
great
outcry
which
came
to
the
ears
of
the
soldan
who
was
much
nearer
with
his
army
than
had
been
supposed
in
the
mean
time
the
christians
made
an
assault
on
mansor
with
too
little
precaution
and
were
repulsed
with
considerable
loss
many
of
them
being
slain
by
large
stones
thrown
upon
them
as
they
entered
the
place
by
which
the
army
not
only
lost
a
considerable
number
of
men
but
was
much
dispirited
by
this
unexpected
repulse
immediately
on
the
back
of
this
discomfiture
the
soldan
came
in
sight
with
his
whole
army
and
seeing
the
christians
in
this
divided
state
brother
separated
from
brother
joyfully
seized
the
opportunity
he
had
long
wished
for
and
inclosing
them
on
all
sides
that
none
might
escape
attacked
them
with
great
fury
in
this
situation
the
earl
of
artois
sore
repented
of
his
headstrong
rashness
when
it
was
too
late
and
seeing
earl
william
longespee
fighting
bravely
against
the
chief
brunt
of
the
enemy
he
called
out
to
him
in
a
cowardly
manner
to
flee
as
god
fought
against
them
but
william
bravely
answered
god
forbid
that
my
son
should
flee
from
the
face
of
a
saracen
earl
robert
turned
out
of
the
fight
and
fled
away
thinking
to
escape
from
death
or
captivity
by
the
swiftness
of
his
horse
and
taking
the
river
thafnis
sank
through
the
weight
of
his
armour
and
was
drowned
on
the
flight
of
earl
robert
the
french
troops
lost
heart
and
began
to
give
ground
but
william
longespee
bearing
up
manfully
against
the
whole
force
of
the
enemy
stood
firm
as
long
as
he
was
able
slaying
and
wounding
many
of
the
saracens
at
length
his
horse
being
killed
and
his
legs
maimed
he
fell
to
the
ground
yet
he
continued
to
mangle
their
legs
and
feet
till
at
last
he
was
slain
with
many
wounds
being
finally
stoned
to
death
by
the
saracens
after
his
death
the
saracens
set
upon
the
remainder
of
the
army
which
they
had
surrounded
on
every
side
and
destroyed
them
all
so
that
scarce
a
single
man
remained
alive
of
the
whole
only
two
templars
one
hospitaller
and
one
common
soldier
escaped
to
bring
the
melancholy
tidings
to
the
king
of
france
thus
by
the
imprudent
and
foolish
rashness
of
earl
robert
the
french
troops
were
utterly
discomfited
and
the
valiant
english
knight
overpowered
and
slain
to
the
grief
of
all
the
christians
and
the
glory
of
the
saracens
and
as
it
afterwards
fell
out
to
the
entire
ruin
of
the
whole
french
army
hakluyt
i
hakluyt
dates
this
expedition
in
the
year
of
the
reign
of
henry
iii
of
england
he
mentions
in
a
former
passage
that
the
same
earl
of
salisbury
accompanied
richard
earl
of
cornwall
in
the
year
of
the
same
kings
reign
into
syria
against
the
saracens
with
many
other
english
of
note
where
they
performed
good
service
against
the
unbelievers
but
gives
no
relation
of
e
the
meaning
of
this
term
of
reproach
does
not
appear
unless
from
some
after
circumstances
it
may
have
proceeded
from
their
horses
having
long
tails
while
those
of
the
french
were
e
probably
e
st
john
e
this
is
probably
meant
for
that
branch
of
the
nile
which
they
had
previously
crossed
on
their
way
to
e
chap
xxi
of
although
the
era
of
modern
discovery
certainly
commenced
under
the
auspicious
direction
of
don
henry
of
portugal
who
first
conceived
and
executed
the
sublime
idea
of
extending
the
knowledge
and
commerce
of
the
globe
by
a
judicious
series
of
maritime
expeditions
expressly
for
the
purpose
of
discovery
yet
as
madeira
is
said
to
have
been
visited
and
the
canaries
were
actually
discovered
and
settled
before
that
era
it
appears
necessary
to
give
a
previous
account
of
these
discoveries
before
proceeding
to
the
second
part
of
this
work
several
authors
have
left
accounts
of
the
real
or
pretended
original
discovery
of
this
island
of
madeira
all
of
whom
concur
in
asserting
that
it
was
first
discovered
by
an
englishman
juan
de
barros
the
livy
of
portugal
mentions
it
briefly
in
the
first
decade
of
his
asia
the
history
of
this
discovery
was
written
in
latin
by
doctor
manoel
clemente
and
dedicated
to
pope
clement
manoel
tome
composed
a
latin
poem
on
the
subject
which
he
intitled
antonio
galvano
mentions
it
in
a
treatise
of
discoveries
made
chiefly
by
the
spaniards
and
portuguese
previously
to
the
year
manoel
de
faria
y
sousa
the
illustrious
commentator
of
camoens
cites
galvano
in
illustration
of
the
fifth
stanza
in
the
fifth
book
of
the
immortal
lusiad
and
likewise
gives
an
account
of
this
discovery
in
his
portuguese
asia
but
the
earliest
and
most
complete
relation
of
this
discovery
was
composed
by
francisco
alcaforado
who
was
esquire
to
don
henry
the
or
prince
of
portugal
the
first
great
promoter
of
maritime
discoveries
and
to
whom
he
presented
his
work
no
person
was
more
capable
of
giving
an
exact
account
of
that
singular
event
than
alcaforado
as
he
was
one
of
those
who
assisted
in
making
the
second
discovery
his
work
was
first
published
in
portuguese
by
don
francisco
manoel
and
was
afterwards
published
in
french
at
paris
in
from
this
french
edition
the
following
account
is
extracted
because
the
original
portuguese
has
not
come
to
our
knowledge
neither
can
we
say
when
that
was
printed
but
as
the
anonymous
french
translator
remarked
that
don
francisco
the
original
with
great
care
it
may
be
concluded
that
the
portuguese
impression
did
not
long
precede
the
french
translation
the
french
translator
acknowledges
that
he
has
altered
the
style
which
was
extremely
florid
and
poetical
and
has
expunged
several
useless
and
tedious
digressions
etymologies
reflections
and
comparisons
but
declares
that
he
has
strictly
presented
the
truth
and
substance
of
the
history
so
as
not
to
vary
from
it
in
the
least
or
to
omit
the
smallest
material
circumstance
it
is
remarkable
that
there
is
no
mention
whatever
in
any
of
the
english
histories
of
machin
macham
or
marcham
the
supposed
author
of
this
discovery
so
that
hakluyt
was
beholden
to
antonio
galvano
for
the
imperfect
account
he
gives
of
that
transaction
by
the
following
abstract
the
complete
history
becomes
our
own
and
we
shall
be
no
longer
strangers
to
an
event
which
has
for
several
ages
rendered
an
englishman
famous
in
foreign
countries
while
wholly
unknown
in
his
own
it
must
not
however
be
omitted
to
observe
that
some
objections
may
be
stated
against
the
authenticity
of
this
history
on
account
of
certain
circumstances
which
do
not
quadrate
with
the
time
assigned
for
voyage
by
the
author
from
these
it
is
obvious
either
that
the
relation
given
by
alcaforado
is
not
genuine
or
that
it
has
been
interpolated
how
far
this
objection
may
be
admitted
without
prejudice
to
the
authority
of
the
whole
story
must
be
left
to
the
judgment
of
our
readers
we
shall
only
add
that
so
far
as
relates
to
macham
it
agrees
with
the
tradition
of
the
inhabitants
of
madeira
according
to
alcaforada
juan
gonsalvo
zarco
a
gentleman
of
the
household
of
don
henry
being
sent
out
by
that
prince
upon
an
expedition
of
discovery
to
the
coast
of
africa
made
prize
in
the
year
of
a
spanish
vessel
filled
with
redeemed
captives
on
their
way
from
morocco
to
spain
in
this
vessel
there
was
one
john
de
morales
an
experienced
and
able
pilot
whom
he
detained
as
an
acceptable
present
to
his
master
don
henry
and
set
all
the
rest
at
liberty
morales
on
being
made
acquainted
with
the
cause
of
his
detention
entered
freely
into
the
service
of
the
prince
and
gave
an
account
to
gonsalvo
of
the
adventures
of
machin
and
the
situation
and
of
the
new
discovered
island
all
of
which
he
had
learnt
from
certain
english
captives
in
the
jails
of
morocco
who
had
accompanied
macham
or
machin
in
his
expedition
the
year
of
this
extraordinary
adventure
is
not
mentioned
by
galvano
who
only
says
that
in
pedro
iv
reigning
in
arragon
the
chronicles
of
his
age
reported
that
about
this
time
the
island
of
madeira
was
discovered
by
one
macham
an
englishman
it
must
be
confessed
that
an
objection
arises
against
this
history
which
is
not
easily
removed
we
are
told
that
immediately
after
the
death
of
macham
his
companions
sailed
over
to
morocco
and
that
morales
was
in
prison
when
they
arrived
supposing
the
discovery
by
macham
to
have
been
made
about
as
related
by
galvano
from
the
castilian
chronicles
morales
must
have
been
no
less
than
years
a
prisoner
when
redeemed
and
when
he
was
detained
by
gonsalvo
in
herbert
places
the
adventure
of
macham
in
which
would
increase
the
captivity
of
morales
to
years
alcaforado
places
the
event
in
the
reign
of
edward
iii
of
england
which
began
in
and
ended
in
even
supposing
it
to
have
happened
in
the
last
year
of
edward
morales
must
have
remained
years
in
captivity
which
is
not
only
highly
improbable
but
is
even
contrary
to
the
sense
of
the
historian
who
supposes
but
a
small
space
to
have
elapsed
between
the
two
events
besides
the
records
quoted
by
galvano
are
said
expressly
to
assert
that
macham
went
himself
into
africa
whence
he
was
sent
to
the
king
of
castile
this
last
circumstance
may
have
been
invented
by
the
spaniards
to
give
them
a
better
title
to
the
island
of
madeira
but
the
former
objection
remains
in
full
force
and
can
only
be
obviated
by
supposing
that
either
morales
advanced
a
falsehood
in
asserting
that
he
had
the
account
of
this
discovery
from
the
english
themselves
instead
of
learning
it
from
the
other
slaves
among
whom

calmer
moment

would
have
duly
observed
the
gradual
rising
of

the
astonished
fugitives

rashness

as
the
tempest
continued
to
augment
the
thick
darkness
of
night
completed
the
horrors
of
their
situation
in
their
confusion
the
intended
port

missed

could
not
be
attained
and
their
vessel
drove
at
the
mercy
of
the
winds

the
morning

found
themselves
in
the
midst
of
an
unknown
ocean
without
skill
to
determine
their
situation
and
destitute
of
knowledge
or
experience
to
direct
their
course

mornings

watchfulness

horizon

when
the
grey
haze
which
had
alternately
filled
them
with
hope
and
despondency
was
dissipated
by
the
rising
sun
the
certainty
of
having
discovered
land
was
welcomed
by
a
general
burst
of
joy
a
great
luxuriancy
of
trees
of
unknown
species
was
soon
observed
to
overspread
the
land
whence
unknown
birds
of

plumage
came
off
in
flocks
to

gave
the
appearance
of

destruction

which
was
encircled
with
laurels

other
flowering
shrubs
presented
a
delightful
retreat
to
the
voyagers
a
venerable
tree
of
ancient
growth
offered
its
welcome
shade
on
an
adjoining
eminence
and
the
first
moments
of
liberty
were
employed
in
forming
a
romantic
residence
with
the
abundant
materials
which
nature
supplied
all
around
the
novelty
of
every
object
they
beheld
induced
curiosity
to
explore
their
new
discovery
and
they
spent
three
days
in
wandering
about
the
woods
when
the
survey
was
interrupted
by
an
alarming
hurricane
which
came
on
during
the
night
and
rendered
them
extremely
anxious
for
the
safety
of
their
companions
who
had
been
left
in
charge
of
the
vessel
the
ensuing
morning
destroyed
all
prospect

away
from

the
vessel
had
broke
from
her
moorings
by
the
violence
of
the
storm
and
was
wrecked
on
the
coast
of
morocco
where
all
on
board
were
immediately
seized
as
slaves
the
afflicted
machin
found
this
last
calamity
too
severe
for
his
terrified
and
afflicted
companion
to
endure
her
susceptible
mind
and
tender
frame
overcome
by
the
severity
of
the
scenes
she
had
gone
through
and
oppressed
by
consciousness
of
having
deviated
from
her
duty
sunk
under
her
afflictive
situation
from
the
moment
it
was
reported
that
the
vessel
had
disappeared
she
became
dumb
with
sorrow
and
expired
after
a
few
days
of
silent
despair
this
heavy
stroke
was
too
much
for
the
inconsolable
lover
to
support
though
watched
over
with
the
utmost
solicitude
by
his
afflicted
friends
all
attempts
to
administer
consolation
were
entirely
fruitless
and
he
expired
on
the
fifth
day
after
the
death
of
his
beloved
mistress
with
his
parting
breath
he
earnestly
enjoined
his
surviving
companions
to
deposit
his
body
in
the
same
grave
under
the
venerable
tree
which
they
had
so
recently
made
for
the
victim
of
his
temerity
and
where
the
altar
which
had
been
raised
to
celebrate
their
deliverance
would
now
mark
their
untimely
tomb
having
performed
this
painful
duty
the
surviving
companions
of
these
unfortunate
lovers
fixed
a
large
wooden
cross
over
the
grave
on
which
they
carved
the
inscription
which
machin
had
composed
to
record
their
melancholy
adventures
and
added
a
request
that
if
any
christians
should
hereafter
visit
the
spot
they
might
erect
a
church
in
the
same
place
and
dedicate
it
to
christ
having
thus
accomplished
the
dictates
of
friendship
and
humanity
the
survivors
fitted
out
the
boat
which
had
remained
ashore
from
their
first
landing
and
put
to
sea
with
the
intention
of
returning
if
possible
to
england
but
either
from
want
of
skill
or
owing
to
the
currents
and
unfavourable
winds
they
likewise
were
driven
on
the
coast
of
morocco
and
rejoined
their
former
shipmates
in
slavery
among
the
moors
this
story
is
reported
in
a
somewhat
different
manner
by
galvano
already
mentioned
according
to
him
one
macham
an
englishman
fled
from
his
country
about
the
year
with
a
woman
of
whom
he
was
enamoured
meaning
to
retire
into
spain
but
the
vessel
in
which
the
lovers
were
embarked
was
driven
by
a
storm
to
the
island
of
madeira
then
altogether
unknown
and
uninhabited
the
port
in
which
macham
took
shelter
is
still
called
machico
his
mistress
being
macham
landed
with
her
and
some
of
the
people
and
the
ship
putting
to
sea
deserted
them
oppressed
with
sickness
and
grief
at
seeing
herself
in
this
hopeless
state
of
exile
the
lady
died
and
macham
who
was
extremely
fond
of
her
constructed
a
chapel
or
hermitage
dedicated
to
jesus
the
saviour
in
which
he
deposited
her
remains
and
engraved
both
their
names
and
the
cause
of
their
arrival
on
a
rude
monument
which
he
erected
to
her
memory
he
afterwards
constructed
a
boat
or
canoe
which
he
hollowed
out
from
the
trunk
of
a
large
tree
in
which
he
and
those
of
his
companions
who
had
been
left
on
shore
along
with
him
passed
over
to
the
opposite
coast
of
africa
without
the
aid
of
oars
sails
or
rudder
he
was
made
prisoner
by
the
moors
who
presented
him
to
their
king
by
whom
he
was
sent
to
the
king
of
castile
madeira
in
the
portuguese
language
or
madera
in
spanish
signifies
and
this
island
derived
its
name
from
the
immense
quantity
of
thick
and
tall
trees
with
which
it
was
covered
when
first
discovered
one
of
the
two
capitanias

this
island
is
divided

named

misfortunes

that

frequently
the
case
with
the

from

the

to

introduction
this
treatise
was
written
in
the
portuguese
language
by
antonio
galvano
who
had
been
governor
of
ternate
the
chief
of
the
molucca
islands
and
was
first
translated
into
english
by
the
celebrated
richard
hakluyt
who
dedicated
it
to
sir
robert
cecil
principal
secretary
of
state
to
queen
elizabeth
it
was
afterwards
inserted
in
osbornes
or
the
oxford
collection
of
voyages
and
travels
and
forms
an
appendix
to
the
first
volume
of
clarke
progress
of
maritime
discovery
and
from
these
sources
the
present
edition
has
been
carefully
prepared
of
richard
hakluyt
the
original
translator
the
following
notice
is
worthy
of
being
preserved
the
richard
hakluyt
was
descended
from
an
ancient
family
at
yetton
in
herefordshire
and
was
educated
at
westminster
school
from
whence
he
was
elected
a
student
of
christ
church
in
the
university
of
oxford
where
he
took
the
degrees
of
bachelor
and
master
of
arts
entering
into
holy
orders
he
was
first
made
a
prebendary
of
bristol
and
afterwards
of
westminster
and
rector
of
witheringset
in
suffolk
besides
this
translation
he
illustrated
the
eight
decades
of
peter
martyr
angelericus
novo
with
curious
notes
he
also
translated
from
the
portuguese
richly
valued
by
the
description
of
florida
her
next
neighbour
and
wrote
notes
of
certain
commodities
in
good
request
in
the
east
indies
molucca
and
china
but
what
has
most
deservedly
perpetuated
his
name
is
his
great
pains
and
judgment
in
collecting
voyages
navigations
trafficks
and
both
from
the
nature
of
this
treatise
on
the
origin
and
progress
of
maritime
discovery
and
from
respect
to
the
memory
of
hakluyt
the
father
of
our
english
collections
of
voyages
and
travels
it
has
been
selected
for
insertion
in
this
place
as
an
appropriate
introduction
to
the
of
our
arrangement
because
its
author
may
be
considered
as
almost
an
original
authority
for
the
early
discoveries
of
the
portuguese
and
spaniards
although
it
may
be
considered
in
some
measure
as
not
precisely
conformable
with
our
plan
yet
one
portion
of
this
summary
is
directly
in
point
and
the
whole
being
curious
and
in
no
respect
tedious
it
is
here
given
entire
changing
the
antiquated
english
of
hakluyt
into
modern
language
although
said
in
its
title
to
extend
to
the
year
the
chronological
series
of
galvano
properly
ends
in
and
the
only
subsequent
incident
is
a
very
slight
notice
of
the
voyage
of
sir
hugh
willoughby
and
richard
chancellor
towards
the
white
sea
in
in
the
original
translation
and
in
the
oxford
collection
this
treatise
is
preceded
by
a
dedication
from
hakluyt
to
robert
and
another
dedication
from
the
portuguese
editor
francis
de
sousa
tavares
to
don
john
duke
of
aveira
both
of
which
are
here
omitted
as
having
no
directly
useful
tendency
except
so
much
of
the
latter
as
refers
to
the
history
of
galvano
besides
the
present
discourse
galvano
composed
a
history
of
the
molucca
islands
of
which
he
had
been
governor
which
work
has
unfortunately
been
lost
or
at
least
is
unknown
in
this
country
he
is
likewise
said
to
have
published
at
lisbon

an
account
of
the
different
routes

which
the
merchandize
of

antonio
galvano
the
author
of
the
following
summary
of
the
discoveries
of
the
world
was
a
portuguese
gentleman
who
was
several
years
governor
of
the
molucca
islands
and
performed
signal
service
to
his
country
in
that
honourable
station
by
dissipating
a
formidable
league
which
had
been
entered
into
by
the
native
princes
of
these
islands
for
the
expulsion
of
the
portuguese
and
though
possessing
very
inadequate
resources
for
the
protection
of
so
important
a
commercial
establishment
he
confirmed
and
extended
the
dominion
and
influence
of
portugal
in
these
islands
when
first
appointed
to
the
command
in
the
moluccas
galvano
carried
with
him
a
private
fortune
of
crusadoes
all
of
which
he
expended
in
the
public
service
though
he
added
a
clear
revenue
to
the
crown
of
crusadoes
in
consequence
of
his
successful
vigilant
and
pure
administration
he
was
so
zealous
in
patronizing
the
propagation
of
the
christian
religion
among
the
islands
belonging
to
his
government
that
on
his
return
to
lisbon
in
he
was
reduced
to
such
extreme
poverty
as
to
be
under
the
necessity
of
taking
refuge
in
the
where
he
died
in
francis
de
sousa
tavares
the
original
portuguese
editor
of
this
treatise
in
a
dedication
of
the
work
to
don
john
duke
of
aveira
gives
the
following
account
of
the
work
and
of
its
author
antonio
galvano
when
on
his
left
me
this
book
along
with
his
other
papers
by
his
testament
and
as
i
am
certain
he
designed
that
it
should
be
presented
to
your
highness
i
have
thought
proper
to
fulfil
his
intentions
in
that
respect
it
was
fitting
that
this
treatise
should
be
written
by
a
native
of
portugal
as
it
treats
of
the
various
ways
in
which
the
spiceries
and
other
commodities
of
india
were
formerly
brought
to
our
part
of
the
world
and
gives
an
account
of
all
the
navigations
and
discoveries
of
the
ancients
and
moderns
in
both
of
which
things
the
portuguese
have
laboured
above
all
other
nations
in
this
treatise
and
in
nine
or
ten
other
books
concerning
india
and
the
moluccas
this
true
portuguese
described
the
unfortunate
and
sorrowful
times
before
our
day
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
when
he
was
appointed
to
the
command
of
the
islands
and
fortresses
of
the
moluccas
all
the
kings
and
chiefs
of
these
islands
had
agreed
to
make
war
against
our
nation
and
to
drive
them
out
of
the
country
yet
he
fought
against
them
all
in
tidore
though
he
had
only
portuguese
soldiers
against
their
whole
united
power
and
gave
them
a
signal
overthrow
in
which
their
king
and
one
ternate
the
principal
author
of
the
war
were
both
slain
besides
which
he
conquered
their
fortresses
and
compelled
them
all
to
submit
to
the
obedience
and
service
of
our
sovereign
in
this
war
two
great
and
wonderful
events
took
place
the
that
all
the
chiefs
and
kings
of
these
islands
united
against
us
who
used
ever
to
be
at
variance
among
themselves
and
that
galvano
with
only
the
ordinary
garrison
should
obtain
the
victory
against
so
great
a
combination
it
has
happened
to
other
governors
of
the
moluccas
with
an
extraordinary
number
of
european
troops
and
assisted
by
all
the
other
native
lords
to
go
to
war
with
one
king
only
and
to
come
back
with
loss
whereas
he
with
a
small
and
inadequate
force
successfully
waged
war
against
a
confederacy
of
all
the
lords
of
these
islands
three
brilliant
exploits
have
been
performed
in
india
beyond
all
others
the
capture
of
muar
by
emanuel
falcon
the
winning
of
bitam
by
peter
mascarenas
and
this
victory
obtained
by
galvano
besides
this
great
exploit
his
father
and
four
brothers
were
all
slain
in
the
kings
service
and
he
being
the
last
of
his
lineage
carried
with
him
about
crusadoes
into
the
moluccas
all
of
which
he
expended
in
propagating
our
holy
faith
and
in
preserving
these
valuable
islands
using
all
his
power
and
influence
to
bring
all
the
cloves
into
the
kings
coffers
by
which
he
added
crusadoes
yearly
to
the
royal
revenue
had
he
gathered
cloves
on
his
own
account
as
other
governors
of
the
moluccas
have
done
he
might
have
come
home
very
rich
but
returning
poor
and
in
the
simplicity
of
his
nature
expecting
to
be
rewarded
for
his
honest
services
he
was
entirely
neglected
and
had
to
take
refuge
in
an
hospital
where
he
remained
seventeen
years
till
his
death
when
he
was
crusadoes
in
debt
partly
for
demands
upon
him
from
india
and
partly
borrowed
from
his
friends
to
maintain
him
in
the
hospital
after
his
death
the
cardinal
desired
me
to
give
his
other
writings
to
damien
de
goes
promising
to
content
me
for
them
which
otherwise
i
should
not
have
done
yet
hitherto
i
have
not
received
any
thing
with
which
to
execute
his
will
yet
for
all
this
as
in
the
prosperity
of
his
victories
he
made
no
boast
so
in
his
adversity
he
always
preserved
an
unabated
spirit
your
grace
therefore
may
perceive
that
this
treatise
and
his
other
works
were
written
under
great
afflictions
yet
was
he
not
willing
to
use
the
remedy
of
zelim
the
son
of
the
great
turk
mahomet
who
took
constantinople
and
died
in
rome
who
used
to
make
himself
drunk
that
he
might
forget
the
high
estate
from
which
he
had
fallen
neither
would
he
follow
the
councils
of
many
of
his
friends
in
withdrawing
from
the
kingdom
saying
he
had
rather
resemble
timocles
the
athenian
than
the
roman
coriolanus
for
all
which
this
treatise
ought
to
receive
favour
from
your
grace
allowing
for
any
oversights
of
the
author
if
there
be
any
such

section
i
of
the
ancient
and
modern
discoveries
of
the
world
chiefly
by
means
of
navigation
from
the
flood
to
the
close
of
the
fifteenth
when
i
first
desired
to
compose
an
account
of
the
ancient
and
modern
discoveries
by
sea
and
land
with
their
true
dates
and
situations
these
two
principal
circumstances
seemed
involved
in
such
difficulty
and
confusion
that
i
had
almost
desisted
from
the
attempt
even
in
regard
to
the
date
of
the
flood
the
hebrews
reckon
that
event
to
have
happened
years
after
the
creation
while
the
seventy
interpreters
make
it
and
st
augustine
extends
the
time
to
years
in
regard
to
geographical
situations
likewise
there
are
many
differences
for
there
never
sailed
ten
or
an
hundred
pilots
in
one
fleet
but
they
made
their
reckonings
in
almost
as
many
different
longitudes
but
considering
that
all
these
difficulties
might
be
surmounted
by
just
comparison
and
the
exercise
of
judgment
i
at
length
resolved
to
persist
in
my
undertaking
some
allege
that
the
world
was
fully
known
in
ancient
times
for
as
it
was
peopled
and
inhabited
it
must
have
been
navigable
and
frequented
and
because
the
ancient
people
were
of
longer
lives
and
had
all
one
law
and
one
language
they
could
not
fail
to
be
acquainted
with
the
whole
world
others
again
believe
that
though
the
world
might
be
once
universally
known
by
mankind
yet
by
the
wickedness
of
man
and
the
want
of
justice
among
nations
that
knowledge
has
been
lost
but
as
all
the
most
important
discoveries
have
been
made
by
sea
and
that
chiefly
in
our
own
times
it
were
desirable
to
learn
who
were
the
first
discoverers
since
the
flood
some
allege
the
greeks
others
the
phenicians
while
others
say
the
egyptians
the
inhabitants
of
india
on
the
contrary
pretend
that
they
were
the
first
navigators
particularly
the
tabencos
whom
we
now
call
chinese
and
allege
in
proof
of
this
that
they
were
lords
of
all
the
indies
even
to
cape
bona
speranca
and
the
island
of
st
lawrence
which
is
inhabited
by
them
as
likewise
all
the
coasts
of
the
indian
seas
also
the
javas
timores

macassar
the
moluccas
borneo
mindanao

besides
all
these
new
spain
peru
brazil
the
antilles
and
all
the
adjoining
lands
are
possessed
by
the
same
race
as
appears
by
the
fashions
and
manners
both
of
the
men
and
women
who
have
small
eyes
flat
noses
with
other
proportions
resembling
the
chinese
and
to
this
day
many
of
these
islands
and
countries
are
called
by
such
names
as
and
the
like
indicating
the
countries
of
or
belonging
to
china
it
farther
appears
that
the
ark
of
noah
rested
upon
the
north
part
of
the
mountains
of
armenia
in
degrees
of
latitude
or
upwards
and
that
scythia
being
a
high
land
and
the
first
that
appeared
out
of
the
universal
deluge
was
first
peopled
and
as
the
province
or
country
of
the
tabencos
or
chinese
is
one
of
the
chiefest
of
all
tartary
its
inhabitants
may
be
considered
as
the
most
ancient
nation
and
the
oldest
navigators
their
seas
are
calm
and
as
lying
between
the
tropics
their
days
and
nights
are
nearly
equal
and
their
seasons
differ
little
in
temperature
and
as
no
outrageous
winds
swell
their
seas
into
storms
navigation
among
them
is
safe
and
easy
their
small
barks
called
catamorans
have
only
a
large
bough
of
a
tree
set
up
in
the
middle
serving
as
mast
and
sail
the
master
steers
only
with
an
oar
and
the
passengers
sit
on
poles
fastened
to
the
bark
it
is
said
that
the
people
of
china
were
anciently
lords
of
almost
all
scythia
and
were
in
use
to
sail
along
that
coast
which
reaches
from
east
to
west
in
seventy
degrees
of
north
latitude
cornelius
nepos
says
that
in
the
time
when
metellus
the
colleague
of
afranius
was
proconsul
of
gaul
the
king
of
the
suevi
sent
to
him
certain
indians
who
came
to
his
country
in
a
ship
by
the
north
and
the
flats
of
germany
these
people
probably
came
from
china
as
in
that
country
in
the
latitudes
of
and
degrees
they
have
strong
and
ships
which
can
bear
the
seas
and
encounter
the
severity
of
the
northern
climate
cambaia
also
has
ships
and
its
inhabitants
are
said
to
have
long
used
the
seas
but
it
is
not
likely
they
should
have
gone
to
gaul
for
they
only
trade
to
cairo
and
are
indeed
a
people
of
little
trade
and
less
clothing
those
who
escaped
from
the
flood
kept
the
hills
not
daring
for
a
long
time
to
descend
into
the
plains
and
low
countries
and
nimrod
an
hundred
and
thirty
years
afterwards
built
the
tower
of
babel
intending
it
as
a
refuge
in
case
of
any
future
deluge
upon
the
whole
it
seems
probable
that
the
inhabitants
of
china
and
the
east
were
the
first
sailors
though
others
think
the
inhabitants
of
the
west
particularly
of
syria
were
the
first
to
use
the
sea
this
contest
about
the
antiquity
of
navigation
i
leave
to
the
scythians
and
egyptians
who
each
challenge
the
honour
to
themselves
but
leaving
all
contested
points
in
this
matter
i
now
apply
to
my
proposed
deduction
resting
only
upon
what
has
been
recorded
in
authentic
histories
ancient
history
says
that
tubal
in
the
hundred
and
year
after
the
flood
came
by
sea
into
spain
whence
it
appears
that
in
these
early
times
navigation
was
usual
from
ethiopia
to
our
parts
of
western
europe
it
is
also
said
that
semiramis
invaded
the
country
on
the
river
indus
whence
the
indians
derive
their
name
and
gave
battle
to
king
stabrobates
in
which
he
lost
a
thousand
ships
by
which
it
clearly
appears
there
were
then
many
ships
in
those
parts
and
that
the
seas
were
much
frequented
in
the
six
hundred
and
fiftieth
year
after
the
flood
there
was
a
king
in
spain
named
hesperus
and
gonsalvo
fernandez
de
oviedo
the
chronicler
of
antiquities
affirms
that
he
made
discoveries
by
sea
as
far
as
cape
verde
and
the
isle
of
st
thomas
of
which
he
was
prince
and
that
in
his
time
the
islands
of
the
west
indies
were
discovered
and
called
the
hesperides
after
his
name
he
alleges
many
reasons
in
proof
of
this
assertion
and
even
says
particularly
that
these
early
navigators
sailed
in
forty
days
from
cape
verde
to
these
islands
others
say
that
the
islands
of
st
thomas
and
de
principe
are
the
hesperides
and
not
the
antilles
which
is
the
more
probable
as
these
ancient
navigators
only
sailed
along
the
coast
not
daring
to
pass
through
the
main
ocean
having
no
compass
nor
any
means
of
taking
altitudes
for
their
guidance
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
many
countries
islands
capes
isthmuses
and
points
the
names
of
which
are
found
in
histories
are
now
unknown
because
in
course
of
ages
the
force
of
the
waters
has
wasted
and
consumed
them
and
has
separated
countries
from
each
other
formerly
joined
both
in
europe
asia
africa
new
spain
peru
and
other
places
in
his
dialogue
called
timaeus
plato
says
there
was
anciently
a
great
country
and
large
islands
in
the
atlantic
named
atlantides
greater
than
europe
and
africa
and
that
the
kings
of
these
parts
were
lords
of
a
great
part
of
spain
but
that
by
the
force
of
great
tempests
the
sea
had
overflowed
the
country
leaving
nothing
but
banks
of
mud
and
gravel
so
that
no
ships
could
pass
that
way
for
long
after
it
is
also
recorded
by
pliny
that
close
by
the
island
of
cadiz
there
was
a
well
inhabited
island
called
aphrodisias
towards
the
straits
of
gibraltar
abounding
in
gardens
and
orchards
but
we
have
now
no
knowledge
of
this
island
except
from
the
bare
mention
of
it
in
ancient
authors
the
isle
of
cadiz
is
said
to
have
been
anciently
so
large
as
to
join
the
continent
of
spain
the
açores
are
held
to
have
been
a
continuation
of
the
mountains
of
estrella
which
join
the
sea
coast
beside
the
town
of
cintra
and
the
sierra
verde
or
which
reach
the
coast
near
the
city
of
in
the
land
of
or
the
island
of
moudim
in
which
algarbe
is
situated
are
supposed
to
have
reached
to
porto
santo
and
madeira
for
it
is
considered
as
an
indubitable
fact
that
all
islands
derive
their
roots
from
the
firm
land
or
continent
however
distant
as
otherwise
they
could
not
stand
firm
other
authors
say
that
from
spain
to
ceuta
in
barbary
people
sometimes
travelled
on
foot
on
dry
land
that
the
islands
of
corsica
and
sardinia
were
once
joined
that
sicily
was
united
with
italy
and
the
negropont
with
greece
we
read
also
of
the
hulls
of
ships
iron
anchors
and
other
remnants
of
shipping
having
been
found
on
the
mountains
of
susa
far
inland
where
there
is
now
no
appearance
of
the
sea
having
ever
been
many
writers
affirm
that
in
india
and
malabar
which
now
abounds
in
people
the
sea
once
reached
the
foot
of
the
mountains
and
that
cape
comorin
and
the
island
of
ceylon
were
once
united
also
that
sumatra
once
joined
with
malacca
by
the
shoals
of
caypasia
and
not
far
from
thence
there
is
a
small
island
which
only
a
few
years
ago
was
joined
to
the
opposite
coast
ptolemy
advances
the
point
of
malacca
three
or
four
degrees
to
the
south
of
the
line
whereas
its
most
southerly
point
now
called
jentana
is
in
one
degree
of
north
latitude
by
which
people
pass
daily
the
straits
of
cincapura
to
the
coasts
of
siam
and
china
and
the
island
of
aynan
is
said
to
have
formerly
joined
the
land
of
china
the
southern
extremity
of
which
ptolomey
placed
far
to
the
south
of
the
line
though
it
now
only
reaches
to
twentieth
degree
of
north
latitude
it
may
even
have
been
that
malacca
and
china
as
ptolemy
sets
forth
extended
beyond
the
line
to
the
south
as
malacca
might
join
with
the
land
called
jentana
and
the
islands
of
bintam
banca
and
salistres
and
the
land
might
be
all
slime
and
ouze
likewise
china
might
be
united
with
the
luçones
borneo
lequeuo
mindanao
and
others
some
are
of
opinion
that
sumatra
joined
with
java
across
what
is
now
the
straits
of
sunda
and
that
java
also
joined
with
the
islands
of
bali
anjave
cambava
solor
hogalcao
maulva
vintara
rosalaguin
and
others
in
that
range
all
of
which
are
so
near
as
to
appear
continuous
when
seen
from
a
small
distance
and
they
still
are
so
near
together
that
in
passing
through
the
channels
which
divide
them
the
boughs
of
the
trees
on
each
side
may
be
touched
by
the
hands
it
is
not
long
since
several
of
the
islands
of
banda
in
the
east
were
drowned
by
the
sea
overflowing
them
and
in
china
about
miles
of
firm
land
are
said
to
have
become
a
lake
all
these
things
are
to
be
considered
as
coming
within
the
limits
of
probability
especially
when
we
take
into
account
what
has
been
related
of
similar
events
by
ptolemy
and
others
but
which
i
here
omit
to
return
to
my
subject
about
years
after
the
deluge
the
city
of
troy
was
built
by
the
dardanians
and
even
before
that
time
spices
drugs
and
many
other
kinds
of
merchandize
which
were
then
more
abundant
than
now
were
brought
from
india
to
europe
by
the
red
sea
hence
if
credit
can
be
given
to
these
accounts
we
may
conclude
that
the
sea
of
old
was
much
frequented
those
of
the
east
bringing
their
commodities
to
the
haven
of
arsinoe
in
the
arabian
gulf
now
called
suez
in
lat
and
at
the
northern
extremity
of
the
arabian
gulf
from
whence
the
goods
were
carried
by
caravans
upon
camels
asses
and
mules
to
cassou
a
city
on
the
coast
of
the
levant
sea
in
lat
allowing
seventeen
leagues
and
a
half
to
every
degree
of
latitude
these
two
cities
are
said
to
have
been
leagues
or
miles
distant
from
each
other
on
account
of
the
heat
these
caravans
or
great
companies
of
carriers
travelled
only
in
the
night
directing
themselves
by
the
stars
and
by
fixed
in
the
ground
for
that
purpose
but
finding
this
journey
attended
with
many
inconveniencies
the
course
was
twice
altered
in
search
of
a
more
commodious
route
about
nine
hundred
years
after
the
flood
and
previous
to
the
destruction
of
troy
egypt
was
ruled
by
a
king
named
sesostris
who
caused
a
canal
to
be
cut
from
the
red
sea
to
that
arm
of
the
nile
which
flows
past
the
city
of
heroum
that
ships
might
pass
and
repass
between
india
and
europe
to
avoid
the
expence
and
trouble
of
carrying
merchandize
by
land
across
the
isthmus
of
suez
and
sesostris
had
large
caraks
or
ships
built
for
this
purpose
this
enterprize
however
did
not
completely
succeed
for
if
it
had
africa
would
have
been
converted
into
an
island
as
there
are
even
now
only
twenty
leagues
or
sixty
miles
of
land
between
the
red
sea
and
the
mediterranean
about
this
time
the
grecians
gathered
a
fleet
and
army
called
the
argonautic
expedition
under
the
command
of
jason
and
alceus
some
say
they
sailed
from
crete
and
others
from
greece
but
they
passed
through
the
propontis
and
the
of
st
george
into
the
euxine
where
some
of
the
vessels
perished
and
jason
returned
back
to
greece
alceus
reported
that
he
was
driven
by
a
tempest
to
the
palus
maeotis
where
he
was
deserted
by
all
his
company
and
those
who
escaped
had
to
travel
by
land
to
the
german
ocean
where
they
procured
shipping
and
sailing
past
the
coasts
of
saxony
friesland
holland
flanders
france
spain
and
italy
returned
to
the
peloponnesus
and
greece
after
discovering
a
great
portion
of
the
coast
of
europe
strabo
on
the
authority
of
aristonicus
the
grammarian
says
that
king
menelaus
after
the
destruction
of
troy
sailed
from
the
grecian
sea
to
the
atlantic
coasted
along
africa
and
guinea
doubled
the
cape
bona
sperança
and
arrived
in
india
concerning
which
voyage
many
other
particulars
might
be
collected
from
the
writings
of
the
ancients
this
mediterranean
sea
was
sometimes
called
the
adriatic
the
aegean
and
the
herculean
sea
and
had
other
names
according
to
the
lands
coasts
and
islands
which
it
skirted
till
running
through
the
straits
of
hercules
between
spain
and
africa
it
communicated
with
the
great
atlantic
ocean
thirteen
hundred
years
after
the
flood
solomon
caused
a
navy
to
be
constructed
at
on
the
red
sea
which
sailed
to
tharsis
and
ophir
which
some
believe
to
have
been
islands
in
the
east
indies
this
fleet
was
three
years
on
its
voyage
and
on
its
return
brought
gold
silver
and
other
commodities
the
islands
to
which
the
navy
of
solomon
traded
were
probably
those
we
now
call
the
luçones
the
lequeos
and
china
for
we
know
of
few
other
places
whence
some
of
the
things
mentioned
as
forming
their
cargoes
can
be
had
or
where
navigation
has
been
so
long
practised
necho
one
of
the
kings
of
egypt
was
desirous
to
have
joined
the
red
sea
with
the
mediterranean
and
is
said
in
history
to
have
commanded
some
phenicians
to
sail
from
the
red
sea
by
the
straits
of
mecca
and
to
endeavour
to
return
to
egypt
by
the
mediterranean
this
they
accomplished
and
sailed
along
the
coast
of
melinda
quiloa
and
sofala
till
they
reached
the
cape
of
good
hope
which
they
doubled
and
continuing
their
course
to
the
north
they
sailed
along
the
coast
of
guinea
all
the
way
to
the
mediterranean
and
returned
to
egypt
after
two
years
absence
being
the
first
who
had
circumnavigated
africa
in
the
year
before
the
incarnation
a
fleet
belonging
to
carthaginian
merchants
sailed
from
cadiz
through
the
ocean
to
the
west
in
search
of
land
they
proceeded
so
far
that
they
came
to
the
islands
now
called
the
antilles
and
to
new
spain
this
is
given
on
the
authority
of
gonzalo
fernandez
de
oviedo
in
his
general
history
who
says
that
these
countries
were
then
discovered
and
that
christopher
columbus
by
his
voyages
in
after
times
only
acquired
more
exact
knowledge
of
them
and
hath
left
us
a
more
precise
notice
of
their
situation
and
of
the
way
to
them
but
all
those
historians
who
formerly
wrote
concerning
the
antilles
as
of
doubtful
and
uncertain
existence
now
plainly
allow
them
to
be
the
same
with
new
spain
and
the
west
indies
in
the
year
before
christ
cambyses
king
of
persia
conquered
egypt
and
was
succeeded
by
darius
the
son
of
hystaspes
this
latter
prince
determined
upon
completing
the
projects
of
sesostris
and
necho
by
digging
a
canal
between
the
red
sea
and
the
nile
but
being
assured
that
the
red
sea
was
higher
than
the
nile
and
that
its
salt
water
would
overflow
and
ruin
the
whole
land
of
egypt
he
abandoned
his
purpose
lest
that
fine
province
should
be
destroyed
by
famine
and
the
want
of
fresh
water
for
the
fresh
water
of
the
nile
overflows
the
whole
country
and
the
inhabitants
have
no
other
water
to
drink
it
may
not
be
too
great
a
digression
from
the
subject
to
say
a
few
words
concerning
egypt
the
natives
allege
that
they
have
in
their
country
certain
animals
of
which
one
half
of
their
bodies
seem
earth
and
the
other
like
rats
one
species
of
which
keeps
continually
in
the
water
while
another
species
lives
on
the
land
in
my
opinion
it
is
these
animals
which
break
the
serpents
eggs
of
which
there
are
many
in
the
nile
but
which
serpents
are
also
called
crocodiles
it
is
said
that
in
ancient
times
these
animals
were
inchanted
so
that
they
could
not
do
harm
to
any
one
but
since
they
have
been
freed
from
the
power
of
inchantment
by
the
arts
and
learning
of
the
egyptians
decaying
they
have
done
much
hurt
by
killing
people
wild
beasts
and
cattle
more
especially
those
which
live
in
the
water
and
come
often
on
land
those
that
live
continually
on
the
land
become
strongly
venomous
the
people
beyond
the
city
of
cairo
used
to
catch
these
animals
and
even
to
eat
them
setting
up
their
heads
on
the
walls
of
the
city
concerning
these
crocodiles
it
is
related
that
they
often
lie
along
the
shores
of
the
river
with
their
mouths
wide
open
on
which
occasion
certain
white
birds
little
larger
than
our
thrushes
fly
into
the
mouths
of
the
crocodiles
and
pick
out
the
filth
from
between
his
teeth
to
the
great
delight
of
the
crocodile
which
however
would
surely
close
his
mouth
and
devour
the
bird
had
not
nature
provided
the
bird
with
a
sharp
sting
growing
from
the
top
of
his
head
which
pricks
the
roof
of
the
crocodiles
mouth
and
forces
him
to
gape
so
that
the
bird
flies
away
unhurt
in
this
manner
by
means
of
a
succession
of
these
birds
the
crocodiles
get
their
teeth
cleansed
in
this
same
river
there
are
many
beasts
resembling
horses
and
upon
the
land
there
are
certain
birds
like
our
cranes
which
continually
make
war
upon
the
serpents
which
come
thither
out
of
arabia
which
birds
and
likewise
the
rats
which
eat
the
eggs
of
the
crocodiles
are
held
in
great
reverence
and
estimation
by
the
egyptians
but
now
to
return
to
my
subject
of
discoveries
in
the
year
before
christ
xerxes
king
of
persia
sent
his
nephew
sataspis
to
discover
india
who
sailed
from
the
mediterranean
through
the
straits
of
hercules
and
passed
the
promontory
of
africa
which
we
now
call
the
cape
of
good
hope
but
wearying
of
the
length
of
the
voyage
he
returned
back
again
as
bartholomew
diaz
did
in
our
days
in
hamilco
and
hanno
two
carthaginian
commanders
who
governed
that
part
of
spain
now
called
andalusia
sailed
from
thence
with
two
squadrons
hamilco
sailing
towards
the
north
discovered
the
coasts
of
spain
france
england
flanders
and
germany
and
some
allege
that
he
sailed
to
gothland
and
even
to
thule
or
iceland
standing
under
the
arctic
circle
in
degrees
north
and
continued
his
voyage
during
two
years
till
he
came
to
that
northern
island
where
the
day
in
june
continues
for
hours
and
the
nights
in
december
are
of
a
similar
length
on
account
of
which
it
is
there
wonderfully
cold
his
brother
hanno
took
his
course
to
the
south
along
the
coast
of
africa
and
guinea
and
discovered
the
fortunate
islands
now
the
canaries
and
the
orcades
hesperides
and
gorgades
now
called
the
cape
de
verde
islands
proceeding
onwards
hanno
doubled
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
went
along
the
eastern
coast
of
africa
to
another
cape
called
aromaticum
now
called
gardafu
and
thence
to
the
coast
of
arabia
and
was
five
years
employed
in
this
voyage
before
his
return
to
spain
others
allege
that
hanno
proceeded
no
farther
than
sierra
leona
which
he
colonized
and
afterwards
discovered
as
far
as
the
equinoctial
line
but
it
would
rather
appear
from
the
length
of
time
he
employed
that
he
must
have
accomplished
the
more
extended
navigation
it
is
reported
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
are
great
witches
and
by
inchantment
bring
certain
serpents
so
much
under
command
that
they
preserve
their
churches
churchyards
gardens
orchards
barns
and
cattle
both
from
wild
beasts
and
thieves
when
these
serpents
see
any
person
doing
or
intending
to
do
harm
they
wind
themselves
in
such
a
manner
around
them
as
to
make
them
prisoners
and
then
command
their
young
ones
to
give
notice
to
their
masters
that
they
may
come
and
secure
the
thieves
but
if
the
thieves
be
numerous
or
the
wild
beasts
of
too
much
strength
so
that
the
serpents
dare
not
encounter
them
they
go
to
their
masters
house
and
if
it
happen
to
be
in
the
night
they
give
many
strokes
with
their
tails
so
as
to
awaken
their
masters
that
they
may
provide
for
their
defence
a
certain
italian
named
aloisius
cadamosta
relates
that
when
he
was
upon
the
discovery
of
guinea
and
resided
in
the
house
of
bisboral
the
grandson
of
king
budomel
he
heard
one
night
when
in
bed
a
great
noise
and
many
blows
given
about
the
house
upon
which
bisboral
arose
and
went
out
and
upon
his
return
cadamosta
demanded
of
him
where
he
had
been
and
he
answered
that
he
had
been
with
his
cobras
or
snakes
which
called
him
in
the
indies
there
are
many
snakes
and
some
of
them
very
full
of
poison
yet
the
indians
carry
them
about
their
necks
and
put
them
in
their
bosoms
and
under
their
arms
without
fear
or
injury
and
at
certain
sounds
the
snakes
will
dance
and
do
many
other
strange
things
at
command
i
was
informed
by
a
certain
portuguese
who
had
been
beyond
the
cape
of
good
hope
towards
sofala
quiloa
and
melinda
that
there
were
certain
birds
in
that
country
which
would
come
to
the
negroes
on
a
call
and
as
the
negroes
moved
on
through
the
woods
the
birds
would
do
the
same
from
tree
to
tree
till
at
length
they
would
alight
on
a
tree
whence
they
would
not
remove
and
on
examining
that
tree
the
negroes
were
sure
to
find
wax
and
honey
but
knew
not
whether
it
grew
there
naturally
or
not
in
the
same
country
they
find
much
wax
and
honey
in
made
by
the
ants
but
somewhat
bitter
in
the
seas
of
that
coast
there
are
certain
fish
known
to
the
fishermen
which
commonly
swim
upright
in
the
water
having
the
faces
and
breasts
of
women
in
the
year
before
christ
the
spaniards
are
said
to
have
gone
by
sea
to
the
flats
of
india
arabia
and
the
adjoining
coasts
to
which
they
carried
various
merchandizes
in
great
ships
and
sailing
to
the
west
they
came
to
certain
flats
which
are
covered
by
the
tide
and
left
bare
by
the
ebb
where
they
caught
many
of
great
size
which
fishing
turned
out
to
their
great
profit
as
they
were
very
abundant
and
much
esteemed
alexander
who
flourished
years
before
christ
travelled
from
europe
into
asia
and
africa
passed
through
armenia
assyria
persia
and
bactria
whence
he
descended
by
the
mountains
of
imaus
and
the
vallies
of
parapomissus
into
india
and
prepared
a
navy
on
the
river
indus
with
which
he
passed
into
the
ocean
he
there
turned
by
the
lands
of
gedrosia
caramania
and
persia
to
the
great
city
of
babylon
leaving
the
command
of
his
fleet
to
onesicratus
and
nearchus
who
sailed
through
the
straits
of
the
persian
sea
and
up
the
river
euphrates
discovering
the
whole
coast
between
the
indus
and
that
river
after
the
death
of
alexander
ptolemy
became
king
of
egypt
who
by
some
was
reputed
to
have
been
the
bastard
son
of
philip
the
father
of
alexander
he
imitating
the
before
named
kings
sesostris
and
darius
caused
dig
a
canal
from
the
branch
of
the
nile
which
passed
by
pelusium
now
by
the
city
of
damieta
this
canal
of
ptolemy
was
an
hundred
feet
broad
and
thirty
feet
deep
and
extended
ten
or
twelve
leagues
in
length
till
it
came
to
the
he
meant
to
have
continued
it
to
the
red
sea
but
desisted
on
the
idea
that
the
red
sea
was
three
cubits
higher
than
the
land
of
egypt
and
would
have
overflowed
all
the
country
to
its
entire

ptolemy
philadelphus
in
the
year
before
christ
changed
the
direction
of
the
indian
traffic
the
goods
from
europe
by
his
orders
were
carried
up
the
nile
from
alexandria
to
the
city
of
coptus
and
conveyed
across
the
desert
from
thence
to
the
of
on
the
to
avoid
the
excessive
heat
the
caravans
travelled
only
in
the
night
directing
their
course
by
the
stars
and
water
being
very
scarce
in
the
desert
they
had
to
carry
a
sufficient
quantity
with
them
for
the
journey
afterwards
to
avoid
this
trouble
deep
wells
were
dug
at
certain
intervals
and
in
other
places
large
cisterns
or
reservoirs
were
constructed
for
the
reception
of
rain
water
still
later
in
consideration
of
the
dangers
attending
the
port
of
on
account
of
flats
and
islands
philadelphus
sent
an
army
into
troglodytica
where
he
constructed
a
haven
called
berenice
in
which
the
ships
engaged
in
the
indian
commerce
took
shelter
as
a
place
of
greater
security
from
thence
the
goods
were
transported
to
the
city
of
coptus
and
afterwards
to
alexandria
which
became
rich
and
famous
through
its
trade
with
india
beyond
any
other
city
in
the
world
insomuch
that
it
is
asserted
that
the
customs
of
alexandria
yielded
every
year
to
ptolemy
auletes
the
father
of
cleopatra
seven
millions
and
a
half
of
gold
though
the
traffic
had
then
scarcely
subsisted
in
that
direction
for
twenty
years
after
the
reduction
of
egypt
and
alexandria
under
the
power
of
the
romans
the
customs
are
said
to
have
advanced
to
double
that
amount
and
the
trade
was
so
great
that
ships
used
to
be
sent
yearly
from
to
india
the
ships
set
sail
every
year
from
about
the
middle
of
july
and
returned
back
within
the
year
the
merchandize
they
carried
amounted
to
the
value
of
one
million
two
hundred
thousand
crowns
and
the
returns
were
an
hundred
for
one
and
through
this
prodigious
increase
of
wealth
the
matrons
and
noble
ladies
of
those
days
in
alexandria
were
exceedingly
profuse
in
decorating
themselves
with
purple
pearls
and
precious
stones
and
in
the
use
of
musk
amber
and
other
rich
perfumes
of
various
kinds
of
all
which
the
historians
and
other
writers
of
that
age
treat
at
great
length
pliny
on
the
authority
of
cornelius
nepos
says
that
one
eudoxus
flying
from
ptolemy
lathyrus
passed
by
sea
through
the
gulf
of
arabia
and
sailing
along
the
eastern
coast
of
africa
doubled
the
cape
of
bona
sperança
arrived
by
the
atlantic
at
cadiz
and
it
would
appear
that
this
navigation
was
as
often
used
in
those
days
as
it
now
is
caius
caesar
the
son
of
augustus
going
into
arabia
found
in
the
red
sea
certain
pieces
of
the
ships
which
had
gone
thither
from
spain
long
after
these
days
it
was
usual
to
pass
to
india
by
land
this
was
done
by
the
kings
of
the
sogdians
the
princes
of
bactria
and
other
famous
captains
and
many
merchants
who
travelled
thither
and
into
scythia
by
land
marcus
paulus
venetus
writes
largely
of
these
countries
and
though
his
book
at
first
was
reckoned
fabulous
yet
what
he
and
others
have
reported
is
now
found
true
by
the
experience
of
travellers
and
merchants
who
have
since
been
to
the
same
parts
it
is
reported
that
the
romans
sent
an
army
by
sea
to
india
against
the
great
khan
of
cathaia
years
before
the
incarnation
which
passing
through
the
straits
of
gibraltar
and
running
to
the
found
ten
islands
opposite
to
cape
finisterre
producing
large
quantities
of
tin
which
perhaps
may
have
been
those
afterwards
called
the
cassiterides
being
come
to
degrees
of
latitude
they
found
a
strait
passing
to
the
west
through
which
they
arrived
in
india
and
gave
battle
to
the
king
of
cathaia
after
which
they
returned
to
rome
whether
this
story
may
appear
possible
or
not
true
or
false
i
can
only
say
that
i
give
it
as
i
found
it
written
in
the
histories
of
these
times
in
the
year
after
the
incarnation
of
christ
the
emperor
trajan
fitted
out
a
fleet
on
the
rivers
tigris
and
euphrates
whence
he
sailed
to
the
islands
of
zyzara
and
passing
the
straits
of
persia
entered
into
the
ocean
by
which
he
sailed
along
the
coast
to
india
till
he
came
to
the
place
where
alexander
had
been
he
there
took
some
ships
which
came
from
bengal
and
learned
the
state
of
the
country
from
the
mariners
but
being
in
years
and
weary
of
the
sea
and
because
he
found
it
difficult
to
procure
necessaries
for
his
army
he
returned
back
to
assyria
after
the
romans
had
subdued
most
part
of
the
world
many
notable
discoveries
were
made
but
then
came
the
goths
moors
and
other
barbarous
nations
who
destroyed
all
the
goths
took
the
city
of
rome
thereafter
the
vandals
went
out
of
spain
and
conquered
africa
in
attila
destroyed
many
cities
in
italy
at
which
time
venice
began
and
in
this
age
the
franks
and
vandals
entered
into
france
in
the
empire
of
rome
was
lost
and
fell
from
the
romans
to
the
goths
in
the
lombards
came
into
italy
about
this
time
the
sect
of
the
arians
prevailed
greatly
and
merlin
the
english
prophet
flourished
in
the
mahometan
sect
sprung
up
and
the
moresco
government
which
invaded
both
africa
and
spain
by
this
it
may
appear
that
all
the
world
was
in
a
state
of
war
and
all
places
so
very
tumultuous
that
traffic
and
merchandize
ceased
no
nation
daring
to
trade
with
another
by
sea
or
land
nothing
remaining
stedfast
neither
in
kingdoms
signories
religions
laws
arts
sciences
or
navigation
even
the
records
and
writings
of
these
things
were
burnt
and
destroyed
by
the
barbarous
power
of
the
goths
who
proposed
to
themselves
to
begin
a
new
world
and
to
root
out
the
memory
and
knowledge
of
all
other
nations
those
who
succeeded
in
the
government
of
europe
perceiving
the
great
losses
of
the
christian
world
by
want
of
traffic
and
the
stoppage
of
navigation
began
to
devise
a
way
of
passing
into
india
quite
different
from
the
route
of
the
nile
and
the
red
sea
and
much
longer
and
more
costly
the
goods
of
india
were
brought
up
the
river
indus
as
far
as
it
was
navigable
they
were
then
carried
by
land
in
caravans
through
the
country
of
parapomissus
into
the
province
of
bactria
and
shipped
on
the
river
oxus
which
falls
into
the
caspian
and
thence
across
that
sea
to
the
haven
of
citracan
or
astracan
on
the
river
rha
or
volga
thence
up
that
river
and
to
the
city
of
novogrod
in
the
province
of
resan
which
now
belongs
to
the
great
duke
of
muscovy
in
lat
the
goods
were
carried
thence
overland
to
the
province
of
sarmatia
and
the
river
tanais
or
don
which
is
the
division
between
europe
and
asia
being
there
loaded
in
barks
they
were
carried
down
the
stream
of
that
river
into
the
paulus
maeotis
to
the
city
of
caffa
anciently
called
theodosia
which
then
belonged
to
the
genoese
who
came
thither
by
sea
in
or
great
ships
and
distributed
indian
commodities
through
europe
in
the
reign
of
commodita
emperor
of
armenia
a
better
course
was
provided
for
this
traffic
the
goods
being
transported
by
land
from
the
caspian
through
the
country
of
hiberia
now
georgia
and
thence
by
the
phasis
into
the
euxine
and
to
the
city
of
trebisond
they
were
thence
shipped
for
the
various
parts
of
europe
it
is
recorded
that
demetrius
nicanor
determined
or
actually
began
to
open
a
canal
of
above
miles
in
length
between
the
caspian
and
euxine
for
the
greater
convenience
of
the
indian
trade
but
he
was
slain
by
ptolemy
ceraunos
and
this
famous
enterprize
fell
to
nothing
all
other
ways
being
lost
by
reason
of
the
wars
of
the
turks
the
spiceries
of
the
indian
islands
particularly
of
java
sumatra
and
the
city
of
malacca
were
carried
up
the
river
ganges
in
bengal
to
the
city
of
agra
thence
they
were
carried
by
land
to
another
city
near
the
indus
named
boghar
where
they
were
discharged
because
the
city
of
cabor
or
laor
the
principal
city
of
the
mogores
stands
too
far
within
the
land
from
thence
they
were
carried
to
the
great
city
of
samarcand
in
bactria
in
which
the
merchants
of
india
persia
and
turkey
met
together
with
their
several
commodities
as
cloth
of
gold
velvets
camblets
scarlet
and
woollen
cloths
which
were
carried
to
cathay
and
the
great
kingdom
of
china
whence
they
brought
back
gold
silver
precious
stones
pearls
silk
musk
rhubarb
and
many
other
things
of
great
value
in
after
times
these
merchandizes
drugs
and
spiceries
were
carried
in
ships
from
india
to
the
straits
of
ormus
and
the
rivers
euphrates
and
tigris
and
were
unladen
at
the
city
of
basora
from
whence
they
were
carried
overland
to
aleppo
damascus
and
barutti
and
there
the
venetian
galliasses
which
transported
pilgrims
to
the
holy
land
came
and
received
the
goods
in
the
year
in
the
time
of
the
emperor
frederick
barbarossa
it
is
said
there
came
to
the
city
of
lubeck
in
germany
a
canoe
like
a
long
barge
with
certain
indians
who
were
supposed
to
have
come
from
the
coast
of
baccalaos
which
is
in
the
same
latitude
with
lubeck
the
germans
greatly
wondered
to
see
such
a
boat
and
strange
people
not
knowing
whence
they
came
nor
being
able
to
understand
their
language
especially
as
there
was
then
no
knowledge
of
their
country
although
the
boat
was
small
in
comparison
with
the
seas
it
had
to
cross
it
is
yet
possible
that
it
might
have
been
conveyed
by
the
winds
and
waves
for
in
our
days
the
of
the
negroes
which
are
very
small
boats
venture
to
navigate
from
quiloa
mosambique
and
sofala
around
the
cape
of
good
hope
even
to
the
island
of
st
helena
a
very
small
spot
in
the
ocean
at
a
great
distance
from
land
in
the
year
after
christ
the
great
soldan
of
cairo
restored
the
trade
of
spiceries
drugs
and
merchandize
from
india
by
the
red
sea
at
which
time
they
unloaded
the
goods
at
the
port
of
judea
and
carried
them
to
mecca
whence
they
were
distributed
by
the
mahometan
pilgrims
so
that
each
prince
endeavoured
to
increase
the
honour
and
profit
of
his
own
country
the
soldans
translated
this
trade
to
their
own
city
of
cairo
whence
the
goods
were
carried
to
the
countries
of
egypt
lybia
africa
tunis
tremessen
fez
morocco
and
suz
and
some
of
them
were
carried
beyond
the
mountains
of
atlas
to
the
city
of
tombuto
and
the
kingdom
of
the
jalophos
till
afterwards
the
portuguese
brought
the
indian
trade
round
the
cape
of
good
hope
to
lisbon
as
we
propose
to
shew
more
at
large
in
a

peter
iv
reigned
in
arragon
and
the
chronicles
of
his
reign
report
that
don
lewis
de
cerda
grandson
of
don
john
de
corda
requested
his
aid
to
go
and
conquer
the
canary
islands
which
had
been
gifted
to
him
by
pope
clement
vi
a
frenchman
about
this
time
too
the
island
of
madeira
is
said
to
have
been
discovered
by
an
englishman
named
macham
who
sailing
from
england
into
spain
with
a
lady
whom
he
loved
was
driven
out
of
his
course
by
a
tempest
and
arrived
in
a
harbour
of
that
island
now
called
machico
after
his
name
the
lady
being
oppressed
with
seasickness
macham
landed
with
her
on
the
island
accompanied
by
some
of
his
people
but
in
the
mean
time
the
ship
weighed
anchor
and
stood
to
sea
leaving
them
behind
on
this
the
lady
died
of
grief
and
macham
who
was
passionately
fond
of
her
erected
a
chapel
or
hermitage
on
the
island
which
he
named
the
chapel
of
jesus
and
there
deposited
her
remains
engraving
both
their
names
and
the
cause
of
their
coming
to
this
place
on
a
monumental
stone
after
this
he
and
his
companions
made
a
boat
or
canoe
out
of
a
large
tree
and
putting
to
sea
without
sails
or
oars
got
over
to
the
coast
of
africa
the
moors
among
whom
he
arrived
considering
their
passage
as
miraculous
sent
him
to
their
king
who
transmitted
both
him
and
his
company
to
the
king
of
castile
in
while
henry
iii
reigned
in
castile
in
consequence
of
information
given
by
macham
respecting
this
island
many
persons
of
france
and
castile
were
induced
to
attempt
its
discovery
and
that
of
the
grand
canary
those
who
went
on
this
expedition
were
principally
from
andalusia
biscay
and
guipuscoa
who
carried
thither
many
men
and
horses
but
i
know
not
whether
this
was
done
at
their
own
charge
or
that
of
the
king
but
however
that
might
be
these
people
seem
to
have
been
the
first
discoverers
of
the
canaries
where
they
took
of
the
islanders
prisoners
there
is
some
difference
among
authors
respecting
the
time
of

that
it

named

dared
for

a
grant
of
the

for
his
kinsman
john
de
betancourt
which
being
conceded
he
departed
from
seville
with
an
armament
to
attempt
the
conquest
the
principal
motive
of
this
enterprize
was
to
make
a
perfect
discovery
of
madeira
of
which
macham
had
before
given
so
much
information
yet
he
went
to
the
canaries
where
he
carried
a
friar
named
mendo
as
bishop
who
had
received
that
dignity
from
pope

he
reduced

and
considerable
quantities
of
honey
wax
camphire

orchill
figs
and
other
merchandize
of
which
he
made
good
profit
this
armament
is
said
to
have
likewise
discovered
porto
santo
the
island
first
occupied
by
betancourt
was
lançerota
where
he
built
a
castle
of
stone
for
the
better
defence
of
the
new
settlers
in
the
year
john
gonzales
zarco
and
tristram
vaz
teixera
gentlemen
of
the
household
to
don
henry
perceiving
the
great
desire
of
their
master
to
discover
new
countries
requested
and
obtained
a
bark
to
proceed
to
the
coast
of
africa
where
they
were
overtaken
by
a
violent
tempest
and
driven
into
a
haven
of
the
island
now
called
porto
santo
where
they
remained
two
years
in
they
discovered
the
island
of
madeira
where
they
found
the
chapel
tomb
and
stone
on
which
macham
had
engraved
his
name
others
write
that
a
castilian
had
informed
don
henry
of
having
made
the
discovery
of
porto
santo
and
that
he
sent
bartholomew
perestrello
john
gonzales
zarco
and
tristram
vaz
teixera
purposely
in
search
of
that
island
according
to
the
signs
and
directions
indicated
by
the
castilian
and
that
these
persons
afterwards
discovered
madeira
in
where
they
found
the
memorial
and
monument
left
by
macham
the
englishman
betancourt
who
begun
the
conquest
of
the
canaries
was
slain
in
a
war
with
the
natives
leaving
one
menante
his
heir
who
afterwards
sold
the
islands
to
one
peter
barba
of
seville
but
others
say
that
john
de
betancourt
went
to
france
to
procure
reinforcements
to
enable
him
to
complete
his
conquests
and
left
the
command
of
lançerota
with
his
nephew
who
hearing
nothing
of
his
uncle
and
being
unable
to
continue
the
contest
with
the
natives
sold
the
canaries
to
don
henry
for
an
estate
in
the
island
of
madeira
it
is
related
that
in
don
henry
sent
a
squadron
with
some
land
forces
under
don
ferdinando
de
castro
on
purpose
to
make
a
conquest
of
these
islands
but
being
repulsed
by
the
bravery
of
the
natives
de
castro
prudently
desisted
from
the
enterprize
and
returned
home
and
that
don
henry
afterwards
resigned
his
claim
to
these
islands
in
favour
of
the
crown
of
castile
the
castilian
writers
however
assert
that
both
don
henry
and
the
king
of
portugal
refused
to
give
up
these
islands
until
the
dispute
was
ended
by
the
judgment
of
pope
eugenius
iv
who
awarded
them
to
the
king
of
castile
these
islands
anciently
called
the
insulae
fortunatae
or
fortunate
islands
are
seven
in
number
in
lat
where
the
longest
day
is
thirteen
hours
and
the
longest
night
the
same
they
are
leagues
distant
from
the
coast
of
spain
and
leagues
from
the
coast
of
africa
the
people
were
idolaters
and
eat
raw
flesh
for
want
of
fire
they
had
no
iron
but
raised
or
tilled
the
ground
with
the
horns
of
oxen
and
goats
for
want
of
better
implements
of
husbandry
every
island
spoke
a
separate
language
and
many
pagan
customs
prevailed
among
the
natives
but
now
the
christian
religion
is
planted
among
them
the
commodities
of
these
islands
are
wheat
barley
sugar
wine
and
which
are
much
esteemed
for
the
sweetness
and
variety
of
their
song
in
the
island
of
ferro
they
have
no
water
but
what
proceeds
in
the
night
from
a
tree
encompassed
by
a
cloud
whence
water
issues
and
serves
the
whole
inhabitants
and
cattle
of
the
island
in
the
year
don
pedro
the
king
son
who
was
a
great
traveller
went
into
england
france
and
germany
and
thence
into
the
holy
land
and
other
places
and
came
home
by
italy
through
rome
and
venice
he
is
said
to
have
brought
a
map
of
the
world
home
with
him
in
which
all
parts
of
the
earth
were
described
by
which
the
enterprizes
of
don
henry
for
discovery
were
much
assisted
in
this
map

was
informed
by
francis
de
sosa

that
in
the
year
don
fernando
the
king
eldest
son
shewed
him
a
map
which
had
been
made
years
before
and
was
found
in
the
study
of
alcobaza
which
exhibited
all
the
navigation
of
the
east
indies
with
the
cape
of
bona
sperança
as
in
our
latter
maps
by
which
it
appears
that
there
was
as
much
discovered
or
more
in
ancient
times
as
now
though
attended
with
much
trouble
and
expence
don
henry
was
unwearied
in
prosecuting
his
plan
of
discoveries
at
length
gilianes
one
of
his
servants
passed
cape
bojador
a
place
terrible
to
all
former
navigators
and
brought
word
that
it
was
by
no
means
so
dangerous
as
had
been
represented
he
having
landed
on
its
farther
side
where
he
set
up
a
wooden
cross
in
memorial
of
his
discovery
in
the
year
died
john
king
of
portugal
and
was
succeeded
by
his
eldest
son
duarte
or
edward
in
don
henry
sent
alphonso
gonzales
balduja
and
gillianes
who
penetrated
from
cape
bajador
to
another
cape
where
they
found
the
country
to
be
inhabited
and
went
forward
to
another
point
of
land
whence
they
returned
to
portugal
in
king
duarte
died
and
his
son
alphonso
being
young
the
kingdom
was
governed
during
his
minority
by
his
uncle
don
pedro
in
don
henry
sent
out
two
ships
under
tristan
and
antonio
gonzales
who
took
a
prize
on
the
coast
and
sailed
to
cape
blanco
or
the
white
cape
in
lat
from
thence
they
brought
home
some
moors
from
whom
don
henry
learned
the
state
of
the
country
don
henry
sent
an
account
of
these
discoveries
to
pope
martin
by
one
fernan
lopez
de
savado
and
the
pope
granted
indulgences
and
everlasting
pardon
of
sins
to
all
who
should
die
in
attempting
the
discovery
of
the
land
of
the
infidels
in
the
year
don
henry
commanded
antonio
gonzales
to
carry
back
the
moors
to
their
own
country
where
they
were
ransomed
for
black
moors
with
curled
hair
or
negroes
and
some
gold
owing
to
which
that
place
is
now
called
rio
de
oro
or
the
golden
river
that
thereby
the
desire
of
discovery
might
be
the
more
increased
he
sent
soon
afterward
one
named
nunnez
tristan
who
discovered
the
islands
of
arguin
who
brought
more
slaves
from
thence
to
portugal
in
one
lancarote
a
groom
of
don
henrys
chamber
and
three
others
armed
certain
ships
with
which
they
sailed
along
the
coast
to
the
islands
of
garze
where
they
took
slaves
which
were
the
first
that
were
brought
from
thence
to
portugal
in
gonsalvo
de
syntra
an
esquire
belonging
to
don
henry
went
captain
of
a
bark
into
these
parts
and
landing
on
the
coast
was
taken
by
the
natives
with
six
or
seven
of
his
people
the
place
where
he
was
cut
off
got
the
name
of
angra
de
gonsalvo
de
syntra
from
him
and
this
was
the
first
loss
sustained
by
the
portuguese
in
their
discoveries
in
three
caravels
were
sent
out
under
antonio
gonsales
diego
aloizio
and
gomes
perez
who
were
ordered
to
refrain
from
going
to
rio
de
oro
to
carry
themselves
peaceably
to
the
natives
to
traffic
with
them
peaceably
and
to
endeavour
to
convert
as
many
infidels
as
possible
to
christianity
but
in
this
they
had
no
success
in
the
same
year
dennis
fernandes
of
lisbon
an
esquire
to
the
king
entered
upon
these
discoveries
more
to
acquire
fame
than
for
profit
in
the
course
of
his
voyage
he
discovered
the
river
or
senegal
between
and
degrees
of
latitude
and
proceeding
onwards
discovered
cape
verde
in
degrees
upon
which
he
erected
a
wooden
cross
and
then
returned
much
elated
at
the
success
of
his
voyage
in
nunnez
tristan
passed
beyond
cape
verde
to
rio
grande
and
went
beyond
that
river
to
another
in
twelve
degrees
he
was
here
taken
and
slain
with
eighteen
other
portuguese
and
the
ship
was
brought
home
in
safety
by
four
or
five
of
the
crew
who
escaped
the
hands
of
the
negroes
in
this
year
a
portuguese
ship
in
coming
through
the
straits
of
gibraltar
was
forced
a
great
way
to
the
westwards
by
a
violent
tempest
and
came
to
an
island
having
seven
cities
the
inhabitants
of
which
spoke
the
portuguese
language
and
they
inquired
of
our
mariners
if
the
moors
still
infested
spain
whence
their
ancestors
had
fled
to
avoid
the
distresses
which
occurred
subsequent
to
the
death
of
don
roderigo
king
of
spain
the
boatswain
of
this
ship
brought
home
some
of
the
sand
from
this
island
and
sold
it
to
a
goldsmith
in
lisbon
who
procured
from
it
a
good
quantity
of
gold
don
pedro
who
then
governed
the
realm
being
made
acquainted
with
this
circumstance
caused
the
whole
to
be
recorded
in
the
house
of
justice
some
think
that
this
island
belonged
to
what
is
now
called
the
antilles
or
new
spain
but
though
their
reasons
for
this
opinion
are
good
i
omit
them
here
as
not
connected
with
my
present
purpose
in
the

license
to
his

three
genoese
gentlemen
of

the
others
being
his
brother
and
nephew
got
permission
from
don
henry
to
take
possession
of
the
cape
de
verde
islands
which
some
believe
to
be
those
called
gorgades
hesperides
and
dorcades
by
the
ancients
but
they
named
them
mayo
saint
jago
and
saint
philip
because
discovered
on
the
days
of
those
saints
some
call
them
the
islands
of

in
the
year
following

excellent
prince

this
last

was
made
by

in
the
year
when
don
ferdinand
king
of
castile
was
engaged
in
the
siege
of
granada
he
sent
christopher
columbus
a
genoese
with
three
ships
for
the
discovery
of

this
columbus
had
first
offered
his

a
western
discovery
to
john

who
refused
to
employ
him
being
sufficiently
furnished

pinzon
and
bartholomew
columbus
his
brother
with
an
hundred
and
twenty
other
persons
in
the
three
ships
some
persons
affirm
that
this
was
the
first
voyage
which
was
ever
conducted
by
the
observation
of
latitudes
they
took
the
canaries
in
their
way
whence
shaping
their
course
for
cipango
or
towards
japan
they
were
much
amazed
to
find
the
sea
all
full
of
weeds
and
with
great
fear
arrived
at
the
antilles
on
the
tenth
day
of
october
the
first
island
they
descried
called
guanahany
by
the
natives
they
named
san
salvador
this
island
is
in
latitude
after
that
they
found
many
islands
which
they
called
the
princes
the
savages
of
those
parts
call
these
islands
by
the
name
of
lucaios
having
indeed
several
names
for
them
and
they
stand
on
the
north
side
of
the
line
almost
under
the
tropic
of
cancer
the
island
of
st
james
or
jamaica
lies
between
the
and
degrees
of
northern
latitude
thence
they
went
to
the
island
which
the
natives
call
cuba
named
ferdinando
by
the
spaniards
after
the
king
which
is
in
degrees
from
whence
they
were
conducted
by
the
indians
to
another
island
called
hayti
named
isabella
by
the
spaniards
in
honour
of
the
queen
of
castile
and
afterwards
hispaniola
or
little
spain
in
that
island
the
admirals
ship
was
wrecked
and
columbus
caused
a
fort
to
be
constructed
of
her
timbers
and
planks
in
which
he
left
roderigo
de
arana
with
a
garrison
of
men
to
learn
the
language
and
customs
of
the
country
columbus
then
returned
to
spain
carrying
with
him
samples
of
gold
and
pearls
and
other
productions
of
the
country
with
ten
indians
six
of
whom
died
on
the
voyage
the
rest
were
brought
to
spain
and
baptized
on
their
way
home
columbus
touched
at
the
açores
and
on
the
fourth
of
march
entered
the
port
of
lisbon
this
discovery
gave
much
discontent
to
the
king
of
portugal
immediately
on
his
arrival
columbus
went
into
castile
where
he
informed
the
king
of
his
discoveries
and
of
the
dissatisfaction
of
the
king
of
portugal
on
this
he
and
his
queen
isabella
sent
word
of
the
recent
discovery
to
pope
alexander
vi
at
which
information
he
and
all
the
italians
were
much
astonished
as
they
marvelled
that
there
should
be
any
land
besides
what
had
been
known
to
the
romans
alexander
made
a
grant
of
all
these
countries
to
the
crowns
of
castile
and
leon
under
condition
that
they
should
labour
to
extirpate
idolatry
and
establish
the
holy
faith
of
christ
among
the
natives
on
the
report
of
this
discovery
so
universal
a
desire
of
travelling
arose
among
the
spaniards
that
they
were
ready
as
it
were
to
leap
into
the
sea
that
they
might
swim
if
possible
to
the
newly
discovered
islands
after
receiving
the
authority
of
the
pope
king
ferdinando
sent
columbus
a
second
time
to
the
country
of
which
he
made
him
admiral
giving
him
many
other
honours
and
a
particular
coat

with
seventeen
ships
and
fifteen
hundred
men
accompanied
by

columbus
with
many
other
knights
gentlemen
of
the
law
and
priests
having
chalices
crosses
and
other
rich
religious
ornaments
and
with
great
power
and
dignity
from
the
pope
the
tenth
day
after
commencing
their
voyage
they
reached
the
canaries
and
from
thence
in
or
thirty
days
they
sailed
to
the
antilles
the
first
island
they
saw
being
in
due
west
from
cape
de
verd
in
africa
they
called
this
island
deseada
or
the
which
is
said
to
be
leagues
from
the
canaries
they
afterwards
discovered
many
more
islands
which
they
called
the
virgins
but
which
are
named
the
caribbee
islands
by
the
natives
from
a
nation
of
that
name
who
are
bold
warriors
and
excellent
marksmen
with
bows
and
arrows
they
poison
their
arrows
with
the
juice
of
a
certain
herb
and
whoever
is
wounded
with
these
is
sure
to
die
biting
himself
like
a
mad
dog
from
thence
they
went
to
the
principal
island
in
these
parts
named
boriquen
by
the
natives
and
st
john
by
the
spaniards
and
thence
to
hispaniola
or
isabella
where
they
found
all
the
men
dead
whom
they
had
left
on
returning
from
the
former
voyage
columbus
left
most
of
his
people
here
to
establish
a
colony
under
the
command
of
his
brothers
and
went
with
two
ships
to
continue
his
discovery
of
cuba
and
jamaica
all
these
islands
are
between
and
degrees
of
northern
latitude
while
the
admiral
was
sailing
in
quest
of
discoveries
his
brethren
and
those
who
were
left
in
hispaniola
were
much
incommoded
by
an
insurrection
among
the
savages
and
columbus
went
back
to
spain
to
give
an
account
of
his
proceedings
to
the
king
and
queen
in
january
a
congress
of
ambassadors
from
spain
and
portugal
was
held
at
tordesillas
for
the
settlement
of
all
disputes
between
the
two
countries
respecting
the
new
discoveries
the
plenipotentiaries
from

ruy
de

and
the

some
conference
these
plenipotentiaries
divided
the

between
the
two
crowns
by
a
meridian
line
drawn
from
north
to
south
leagues
to
the
west
of
the
islands
of
cape
verd
all
to
the
east
of
this
line
being
appropriated
to
portugal
and
all
to
the
west
to
spain
leaving
however
the
liberty
of
navigation
equally
to
both
in
john
ii
king
of
portugal
died
and
was
succeeded
by
his
cousin
emanuel
in
the
year
a
venetian
named
john
cabota
or
gabota
went
to
england
and
having
acquired
a
knowledge
of
the
new
discoveries
and
perceiving
by
the
globe
that
the
islands
of
the
antilles
were
almost
in
the
same
latitude
with
his
own
country
and
lay
much
nearer
to
england
than
spain
and
portugal
he
acquainted
henry
vii
with
this
circumstance
and
offered
his
services
to
make
discoveries
for
the
crown
of
england
henry
was
much
pleased
with
the
proposal
and
furnished
him
with
two
ships
and
three
hundred
men
with
which
he
set
sail
in
the
spring
of
that
year
and
sailed
west
till
he
came
in
sight
of
land
in
lat
whence
he
sailed
northwards
till
he
came
into
the
latitude
of
degrees
where
the
day
is
hours
long
and
the
night
is
very
clear
and
bright
he
there
found
the
air
very
cold
with
great
islands
of
ice
and
found
no
bottom
with
a
line
of
fathoms
from
thence
finding
the
land
turn
eastwards
he
coasted
along
it
discovering
all
the
bay
and
river
named
deseado
to
see
if
it
passed
on
to
the
other
side
of
the
land
cabot
afterwards
sailed
down
the
coast
to
the
lat
of
though
some
people
allege
that
he
reached
cape
florida
in
in
the
year
columbus
was
again
sent
out
on
discovery
with
six
ships
furnished
by
the
crown
of
spain
and
two
others
fitted
out
at
his
own
expence
sending
his
brother
before
he
sailed
from
cadiz
taking
his
son
don
diego
along
with
him
it
was
then
reported
that
he
meant
to
take
the
island
of
madeira
because
he
distrusted
the
frenchmen
and
therefore
sent
three
ships
thither
others
say
that
his
object
was
for
the
canaries
however
this
may
be
he
went
with
four
ships
to
the
cape
de
verd
islands
whence
he
ran
along
a
parallel
finding
great
rains
and
calms
and
the
first
land
he
came
to
in
the
antilles
was
an
island
in
nine
degrees
of
north
latitude
called
trinidada
which
lies
close
to
the
main
land
here
he
entered
the
gulf
of
paria
and
came
out
by
the
bocca
de
dragone
or
holding
his
course
westwards
along
the
coast
of
paria
he
came
to
the
islands
called
los

or
the

beyond
which
is
the
island
of
cubagua
where
there
is
a
great

where
also
there
is
a
well

islands
seas
and
countries
not
known
before

or
the

albuquerque
stood
over

the
coast
of
arabia
which
he
explored
and
doubled
the
cape

which
is
under

in
diego
lopez
de

went
from

and
stopping
at
the

of
madagascar
was
almost
a
year
on
his

arriving
at
cochin
in
the
month

the

gave
him
another
ship
in
which
he
went
to
malacca
in

passing
between
the
islands
of
nicubar
and
many
others
he
went
also
to
sumatra
to
the
cities
of
pedir
and
pacem
and
all
along
that
coast
to
the
island
of
puloreira
and
the
fiats
of
capacia
thence
he
stood
over
to
the
city

malacca
in
lat
where
the
people
took
and
slew
some
of
his
men
after
this
he
returned
to
cochin
having
discovered
five
hundred
leagues
in
this
voyage
the
island
of
sumatra
is
the
first
land
in
which
we
knew
of
mens
flesh
being
eaten
by
certain
people
in
the
mountains
called
bacas
who
gild
their
teeth
in
their
opinion
the
flesh
of
the
blacks
is
sweeter
than
that
of
the
whites
the
flesh
of
the
oxen
kine
and
hens
in
that
country
is
as
black
as
ink
a
people
is
said
to
dwell
in
that
country
called
having
tails
like
sheep
there
are
likewise
springs
of
rock
oil
or
bitumen
in
the
kingdom
of
pedir
likewise
there
is
said
to
be
a
river
of
oil
which
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
as
we
are
assured
there
is
also
a
well
of
oil
in
bactria
it
is
further
said
that
there
is
a
tree
in
that
country
the
juice
of
which
is
a
strong
poison
if
it
touch
a
mans
blood
but
if
drank
it
is
a
sovereign
antidote
against
poison
they
have
here
also
certain
gold
coins
called
drachms
brought
as
they
say
into
their
country
by
the
romans
which
seems
to
have
some
resemblance
to
truth
because
beyond
that
country
there
are
no
gold
coins
in
alphonso
de
hojeda
went
with
the
license
of

of
the
new
world
landing
in
the
country
of
uraba
he
called
it
castilia

of
the
gold

in
the
sand
along
its
coast
he
went

the

was
followed
by
a
fourth
ship
with
provisions
and
ammunition
and
a
reinforcement
of
spaniards
hojeda
landed
at
carthagena
where
the
natives
took
slew
and
devoured
seventy
of
his
men
by
which
his
force
was
much
weakened
some
time
after
but
in
the
same
year
diego
de
niquesa
fitted
out
seven
ships
in
the
port
of
beata
intending
to
go
to
veragua
with
men
but
coming
to
carthegana
where
he
found
hojeda
much
weakened
by
his
losses
they
joined
their
forces
and
avenged
themselves

the
natives
in
this
voyage

discovered
the

went
on

with
his
soldiers

built
there
the

defence
against
the
caribbees
being
the
first
town
built
by
the
spaniards
on
the
continent
of
the
new
world
he
also
built
another
at
nombre
de
dios
and
called
it
nuestra
seniora
de
la
antigua
a
town
was
built
at
uraba
in
which
francis
pisarro
was
left
with
the
command
who
was
there
much
annoyed
by
the
natives
they
likewise
built
other
towns
the
names
of
which
i
omit
in
this
enterprize
the
spaniards
did
not
meet
with
the
success
they
expected
in
don
diego
columbus
the
second
admiral
of
new
spain
went
to
the
island
of
hispaniola
with
his
wife
and
household
and
she
being
a
noble
woman
carried
with
her
many
ladies
of
good
families
who
were
there
married
by
which
means
the
spaniards
began
to
multiply
in
their
new
colony
and
hispaniola
became
famous
and
much
frequented
columbus
likewise
reduced
cuba
into
order
and
took
measures
for
its
colonization
where
he
placed
one
diego
velasques
as
his
lieutenant
who
had
accompanied
his
father
in
his
second
voyage
of
discovery
in
april
alphonso

albuquerque
went
to
malacca
from
cochin
and
finding
certain
chinese
about
to
return
from
malacca
into
their
own
country
he
sent
a
portuguese
along
with
them
named
duarte
fernandes
with
letters
for
the
king
of
the
mantias
now
called
siam
they
passed
through
the
straits
of
cincapura
and
sailed
northwards
along
the
coast
of
patane
to
the
city
of
cuy
and
thence
to
odia
the
chief
city
of
the
kingdom
in
the
king
of
this
country
received
duarte
with
great
honour
as
he
was
the
first
portuguese
who
had
been
in
these
parts
and
sent
back
ambassadors
along
with
him
to
albuquerque
they
travelled
overland
to
the
westwards
till
they
came
to
tanacerim
on
the
bay
of
bengal
in
where
they
embarked
in
two
ships
and
sailed
to
malacca
the
inhabitants
of
siam
through
which
they
travelled
eat
of
all
kinds
of
beasts
and
even
of
what
we
repute
to
be
vermin
the
people
of
this
country
are
reputed
the
most
virtuous
and
honest
of
any
in
those
parts
of
the
world
and
pride
themselves
much
on
their
poverty
and
chastity
yet
have
a
strange
practice
of
carrying
round
bells
within
their
foreskins
which
is
not
permitted
to
the
king
and
priests
they
do
not
rear
any
poultry
or
pigeons
about
their
houses
the
kingdom
is
leagues
in
length
and
in
breadth
elephants
are
so
numerous
in
this
country
that
on
going
to
war
the
king
is
said
to
carry
into
the
field
besides
others
which
are
left
in
the
several
garrisons
this
king
has
great
pride
in
the
possession
of
a
white
elephant
having
red
eyes
which
glare
like
a
flame
of
fire
in
this
country
there
is
a
certain
species
of
small
vermin
which
attaches
itself
to
the
trunks
of
the
elephants
to
suck
their
blood
by
which
many
elephants
die
the
skull
of
this
insect
is
so
hard
as
to
be
impenetrable
to
a
musket
shot
they
have
on
their
livers
the
figures
of
men
and
women
which
the
natives
call
toketa
resembling
a
mandrake
and
it
is
affirmed
that
whoever
has
one
of
these
about
him
can
not
be
killed
by
an
iron
weapon
they
have
also
wild
kine
in
this
country
in
the
heads
of
which
certain
stones
are
found
which
have
the
virtue
to
bring
good
fortune
to
merchants
after
the
return
of
duarte
fernandes
from
siam
albuquerque
sent
a
knight
named
ruy
nunnez
de
acunha
as
ambassador
to
the
king
of
the
sequies
the
country
we
now
call
pegu
he
went
in
a
junk
of
the
country
passing
cape
rachado
and
thence
to
the
city
of
pera
on
the
river
salano
on
which
river
are
many
other
villages
where
duarte
had
been
before
and
he
afterwards
went
by
tanaçerim
to
the
city
of
martavan
in
and
the
city
of
pegu
in
this
was
the
first
portuguese
who
travelled
in
that
kingdom
and
who
brought
back
a
good
account
of
the
country
and
people
in
the
end
of
albuquerque
sent
three
ships
to
the
islands
of
banda
and
molucca
under
command
of
antonio
de
breu
and
francis
serrano
with
an
hundred
and
twenty
men
passing
through
the
straits
of
saban
and
along
the
island
of
sumatra
and
other
islands
on
their
left
named
the
salites
they
came
to
the
islands
of
palimbang
and
whence
they
sailed
by
the
noble
island
of
java
and
eastwards
between
it
and
the
island
of
madura
in
this
last
island
the
men
are
strong
and
warlike
and
care
little
for
their
lives
even
their
women
going
out
to
war
these
people
are
almost
continually
engaged
in
war
and
mutual
slaughter
like
the
mocos
and
seem
to
place
their
only
delight
in
bloodshed
beyond
java
they
came
to
another
island
called
bali
and
afterwards
to
avajave
sambaba
solor
galao
malva
vitara
rosalanguin
and
arus
whence
are
brought
beautiful
birds
in
much
estimation
on
account
of
their
feathers
beyond
these
islands
they
came
to
numbers
of
others
lying
in
or
degrees
of
south
latitude
all
so
close
together
as
to
appear
like
one
entire
mainland
and
stretching
near
leagues
in
length
the
ancient
cosmographers
describe
all
these
islands
by
one
general
name
the
but
more
recent
knowledge
has
found
that
they
have
all
separate
names
beyond
these
and
more
to
the
north
there
are
other
islands
which
are
inhabited
by
a
whiter
people
clothed
in
shirts
doublets
and
trowsers
something
like
the
portuguese
dress
and
who
also
have
silver
money
their
magistrates
carry
red
staves
in
their
hands
as
badges
of
command
and
seem
to
have
some
affinity
in
this
respect
with
the
people
of
china
there
are
other
islands
in
these
parts
or
which
the
inhabitants
are
red
and
it
is
reported
they
are
the
same
people
with
the
chinese
de
breu
went
northwards
to
the
small
island
of
gumnape
or
ternate
from
the
highest
part
of
which
flakes
or
streams
like
fire
fell
continually
into
the
sea
he
went
thence
to
the
islands
of
burro
and
amboyna
and
came
to
anchor
in
the
haven
of
guliguli
where
in
a
village
near
a
river
they
found
dead
men
hanging
up
in
the
houses
as
the
people
are
cannibals
here
they
burnt
the
ship
of
serrano
as
she
was
old
and
rotten
and
going
to
a
place
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
in
they
loaded
cloves
nutmegs
and
mace
in
a
junk
or
barque
which
serrano
bought
it
is
said
that
in
an
island
not
far
from
banda
there
are
immense
quantities
of
snakes
especially
in
a
cave
in
the
centre
of
the
island
the
same
is
said
of
formentera
in
the
mediterranean
anciently
ophiusa
between
majorca
and
minorca
on
their
return
from
banda
towards
malacca
in
francis
serrano
perished
with
his
junk
on
the
flats
called
baxos
de
luçapinho
nine
or
ten
of
the
portuguese
crew
escaping
to
the
island
of
mindanao
who
were
sent
for
by
the
kings
of
the
moluccas
these
were
the
first
of
the
portuguese
who
came
to
the
islands
of
cloves
which
are
in
lat
and
they
remained
there
seven
or
eight
years
some
portuguese
and
princes
of
the
moors
once
endeavoured
to
go
near
that
part
of
the
isle
of
ternate
which
throws
out
fire
but
could
not
accomplish
it
but
antonio
galvano
accomplished
this
enterprise
and
found
a
spring
so
cold
that
he
could
not
bear
his
hand
in
the
water
nor
suffer
any
of
it
in
his
mouth
though
almost
directly
under
the
line
in
these
molucca
islands
there
are
certain
men
who
have
spurs
on
their
ancles
like
cocks
and
i
was
told
by
the
king
of
tidore
that
in
the
islands
of
batochina
there
are
people
with
tails
who
have
a
lactiferous
nipple
on
the
scrotum
there
are
small
hens
also
in
these
parts
many
of
which
are
black
in
the
flesh
and
lay
their
eggs
larger
than
those
of
ducks
in
holes
above
nine
feet
under
ground
they
have
likewise
hogs
with
horns
and
excellent
talking
parrots
which
they
call
there
is
also
a
river
so
very
hot
that
it
takes
off
the
skin
of
any
living
creature
that
bathes
in
its
waters
and
yet
contains
living
fish
their
crabs
are
very
sweet
to
eat
yet
their
claws
are
so
strong
that
they
will
break
the
iron
of
a
pickax
and
there
are
small
hairy
crabs
in
the
sea
which
are
rank
poison
as
whoever
eats
of
them
immediately
dies
in
these
seas
are
certain
oysters
called
having
shells
of
so
great
size
that
they
might
serve
as
fonts
for
baptizing
children
in
these
seas
there
are
certain
living
stones
which
grow
and
increase
like
plants
of
which
excellent
lime
may
be
made
by
burning
in
the
usual
manner
when
taken
fresh
from
the
sea
but
if
allowed
to
remain
long
in
the
air
it
loses
all
its
strength
and
will
not
afterwards
burn
into
line
there
is
a
tree
which
bears
flowers
only
at
sunset
which
fell
off
immediately
when
blown
there
is
likewise
a
certain
fruit
whereof
if
a
woman
who
has
conceived
shall
eat
the
child
by
and
by
moves
there
is
farther
a
certain
herb
which
followeth
the
sun
and
removes
after
it
which
is
a
strange
and
marvellous
thing
in
while
on
the
voyage
from
malacca
to
goa
the
ship
in
which
albuquerque
embarked
was
lost
simon
de
andrada
and
a
few
portuguese
were
driven
among
the
maldivia
islands
where
they
remained
till
they
learnt
the
fate
of
the
viceroy
these
islands
are
low
small
and
very
numerous
and
are
full
of
palm
trees
or
which
are
good
against
all
kinds
of
poison
in
this
year
john
de
solis
a
native
of
lisbon
and
chief
pilot
to
king
ferdinand
went
from
spain
by
license
to
discover
the
coast
of
brazil
following
the
course
of
the
pinsons
he
went
to
cape
st
augustine
and
thence
sailed
along
the
whole
coast
to
the
harbour
of
de
lagoa
and
in
lat
he
discovered
a
river
called
or
the
great
river
and
from
signs
of
silver
he
gave
it
the
name
of
rio
de
la
plata
or
the
river
of
silver
it
is
even
said
that
he
went
farther
at
this
time
and
returning
into
spain
gave
an
account
of
his
discovery
to
king
ferdinand
from
whom
he
demanded
and
obtained
leave
to
colonize
the
country
and
received
the
appointment
of
governor
on
this
he
provided
three
ships
and
returned
to
that
country
in
but
was
slain
by
the
natives
the
family
of
de
solis
produced
several
great
discoveries
in
these
parts
in
the
same
year
john
ponce
de
leon
who
had
been
governor
of
the
island
of
st
john
in
the
antilles
armed
two
ships
with
which
he
went
in
search
of
the
island
of
boyuca
where
it
was
reported
there
was
a
spring
which
made
old
men
young
again
but
after
searching
for
six
months
he
could
not
find
it
in
he
discovered
a
point
of
the
continent
upon
which
he
called
the
country
of
florida
and
because
he
expected
the
land
would
yield
gold
and
silver
he
begged
it
from
king
ferdinand
but
died
in
the
discovery
of
the
country
as
many
had
done
before
in
the
year
vasco
nunnes
de
valboa
or
balboa
hearing
of
the
determined
to
go
thither
and
being
a
man
of
courage
though
strongly
dissuaded
by
several
of
his
company
he
marched
on
the
enterprize
with
men
leaving
darien
on
the
first
of
september
and
taking
some
indians
along
with
him
as
guides
he
marched
directly
across
the
isthmus
sometimes
without
opposition
and
having
at
other
times
to
fight
his
way
in
a
certain
place
called
careca
he
found
some
negroes
with
curled
hair
who
were
captives
among
the
indians
at
length
on
the
of
the
same
month
of
september
being
the
festival
of
st
michael
he
came
in
sight
of
the
south
sea
he
there
embarked
in
a
canoe
much
against
the
will
of
the
cacique
of
that
part
of
the
coast
who
endeavoured
to
persuade
him
that
the
navigation
was
very
dangerous
but
he
persisted
in
his
design
that
he
might
be
the
first
who
had
navigated
this
new
discovered
sea
and
came
back
in
safety
he
returned
thence
to
darien
bringing
with
him
a
good
store
of
gold
silver
and
pearls
which
he
had
taken
during
the
march
and
for
this
good
service
he
was
much
honoured
and
favoured
by
king
ferdinand
in
february
alphonsus
de
albuquerque
went
from
goa
towards
the
straits
of
mecca
with
twenty
ships
and
arriving

aden
battered
it
with
his
cannon
and
passing
the
straits
entered
the
red
sea
and
wintered

the
island
of
camaran
this
was
the
portuguese
captain
who
gave

account
of
the

and
the
persian
gulf
which
are
of
great
importance
in

him
many
canoes
or
boats
made
of

tree
with
which
they
passed
to
the
isle
of
pearls
where
they
were
at
first
resisted
but
chiapes
and
tumaccus
pacified
the
cacique
of
that
island
who
submitted
himself
and
received
baptism
taking
the
name
of
the
governor
pedro
arias
and
presented

with
a
basket
of
pearls
weighing

of
which
were
as
large
as

pearls
was
sold
for

where
he
was
joined
by
lewis
de

with
a
reinforcement
of
men
they
resolved
to
proceed
to
the
south
as
the
richest
country
and
taking
some
indians
as
guides
they
found
some
slaves
along
the
coast
marked
with
the
irons
used
by
the
portuguese
they
marched
a
considerable
way
through
the
country
with
much
difficulty
but
made
a
considerable
booty
in
gold
and
took
forty
serviceable
slaves
but
a
caçique
named
pariza
attacked
them
and
slew
or
took
most
of
the
party
after
this
the
governor
sent
out
his
son
john
arias
de
avila
to
be
revenged
and
to
explore
the
country
this
party
went
westwards
to
cape

in
little
more
than
and
thence
to
punta
de
borica
and
to
cape
blanco
in
having
as
they
affirm
discovered
leagues
and
besides
this
they
founded

they
travelled
leagues
through

country
as
pleasant
as

went
much
and
was
fond
of
trout
fishing
which
are
abundant
in

rivers
of
his
kingdom
the

to
pass
to
the
great
kingdom
of

and
likewise
to
bengala
with
a
dispatch
to
john

who
was
the

portuguese
who
drank
of
the
waters
of

took
in
a
loading
of
pepper
at
cochin
as
the
principal
merchandize
for

in
china
for
which
country
he
sailed
with
eight
ships
four
portuguese
and
four
malayans
on
his
arrival
in
china
finding
he
could
not
be
allowed
to
land
without
an
embassy
he
dispatched
thomas
perez
with
instructions
for
that
purpose
from
the
city
of
canton
where
they
came
to
anchor
the
embassy
travelled
leagues
by
land
to
the
city
of
pekin
where
the

the
largest
kingdom
in

south
which
is
in
it

to
the
latitude
almost
of

must
be
leagues
in
length
and
it
is
said
to
be
leagues

fernando
perez
was
fourteen
months
in
the
isle
of
veniaga
endeavouring
to
acquire
as
much
knowledge
as
he
could
of
the
country
and
although
one
raphael
perestrello
had
formerly
been
there
in
a
junk
belonging
to
some
merchants
of
malacca
yet
perez
certainly
deserves
the
merit
of
this
discovery
as
well
because
he
acted
by
the
command
of
the
king
his
master
as
in
discovering
so
much
by
land
by
means
of
thomas
perez
and
by
sea
through
george
mascarenhas
who
sailed
to
the
city
of
foquiam
in
in
the
year
in
which
charles
afterwards
emperor
came
into
spain
francis
fernandes
de
cordova
christopher
morantes
and
lopez
ochoa
armed
three
ships
from
cuba
at
their
own
expence
having
also
with
them
a
barque
belonging
to
the
governor
diego
velasques
with
which
they
came
to
land
in
jucutan
in
at
a
place
which
they
called
punta
de
las
duennas
which
was
the
first
place
in
which
temples
and
houses
of
stone
and
lime
had
been
seen
in
the
new
world
the
people
here
who
were
better
clothed
than
in
any
other
place
had
crosses
which
they
worshipped
and
set
upon
the
tombs
of
their
dead
whence
it
appeared
as
if
they
had
formerly
been
in
the
faith
of
christ
and
some
suppose
that
this
had
been
the
situation
of
the
in
this
expedition
they
were
upon
the
north
coast
of
jucutan
being
the
first
discovery
of
new
spain
or
mexico
and
they
returned
thence
to
cuba
with
some
samples
of
gold
and
some
prisoners
in
the
year
lopez
suares
commanded
don
john
de
silveira
to
go
and
make
peace
with
the
maldive
islands
which
he
did
accordingly
from
thence
silveira
went
to
the
city
of
chatigam
or
chittigong
on
one
of
the
mouths
of
the
ganges
under
the
tropic
of
cancer
for
it
is
to
be
noted
that
this
river
and
the
indus
which
lies
leagues
beyond
diu
and
the
river
of
canton
in
china
all
fall
into
the
sea
under
one
parallel
of
latitude
although
before
this
period
fernando
perez
had
been
commanded
to
sail
to
bengal
yet
silveira
must
be
looked
upon
as
the
actual
discoverer
of
that
country
for
he
went
as
and
remained
there
long
making
himself
acquainted
with
the
manners
of
the
people
and
the
commodities
of
the

grisalva
coasted
along
the
land
on
the
west

of
the
bay
of
honduras
and
came
to
an
island
which
he
named

day
they
went
unto
the
end
of
that

whence
they
came
back
finding
no
passage
and
proceeded
to
a
river
in
lat
which
they
called
the
river
of
grisalva
they
were
boldly
opposed
by
the
people
on
this
coast
yet
they
brought
thence
some
gold
silver
and
feathers
and
returned
to
cuba
in
the
same
year
francis
garay
fitted
out
three
ships
from
jamaica
at
his
own
expence
and
went
to
cape
florida
in
lat
which
seemed
a
most
pleasant
island
and
thinking
it
better
to
people
islands
than
the
firm
land
because
more
easily
conquered
and
kept
under
subjection
he
went
on
land
but
the
inhabitants
of
florida
killed
a
great
many
of
his
people
and
he
was
forced
to
and
go
away
sailing
from
thence
he
came
to
the
river
of
panuco
leagues
from
cape
florida
sailing
all
the
way
along
the
coast
and
endeavouring
to
land
in
various
places
but
the
natives
repulsed
him
in
every
place
many
of
his
people
were
killed
and
eaten
by
the
savages
in
chila
the
natives
hanging
up
their
skins
in
the
temples
of
their
gods
as
a
memorial
of
their
own
valour
yet
garay
visited
this
place
next
year
as
he
had
seen
some
indications
of
gold
and
silver
and
even
applied
to
the
emperor
to
be
appointed
governor
of
the
coast
he
had
discovered
in
february
fernando
cortez
sailed
from
cuba
for
the
country
now
called
new
spain
with
eleven
ships
and
spaniards
he
landed
first
in
the
island
of
cozumel
where
he
immediately
destroyed
all
the
idols
and
planted
crosses
and
images
of
the
virgin
on
all
the
altars
from
thence
he
went
to
the
cabo
de
las
duennas
on
the
peninsula
of
yucatan
and
thence
to
the
river
of
tabasco
where
he
attacked
a
city
called
potoncion
this
place
was
surrounded
with
wood
the
houses
were
built
of
stone
and
lime
and
roofed
with
tiles
and
the
people
resisted
the
assailants
manfully
but
st
james
appeared
on
horseback
to
the
assistance
of
the
spaniards
and
they
took
the
place
this
as
the
first
town
subdued
by
them
on
the
continent
they
named
vittoria
from
thence
they
went
to
a
place
named
st
juan
de
vilhua
said
to
be
or
leagues
from
mexico
where
one
tendilli
was
governor
for
king
muteçuma
though
the
spaniards
and
he
could
not
understand
each
other
yet
tendilli
gave
them
good
entertainment
cortes
had
twenty
women
along
with
his
expedition
one
of
whom
named
marine
was
born
in
the
country
of
the
indians
and
was
the
first
native
of
new
spain
who
received
baptism
she
and
anguilar
served
as
interpreters
between
cortes
and
the
natives
tendilli
sent
immediate
intelligence
to
muteçuma
that
there
had
arrived
in
his
country
a
bearded
people
for
so
they
called
the
castilians
on
the
reception
of
this
news
muteçuma
was
greatly
troubled
for
his
gods
or
devils
rather
had
revealed
that
a
people
of
the
description
of
these
spaniards
was
to
overthrow
his
law
and
dominion
and
to
become
lords
of
the
country
wherefore
muteçuma
sent
gifts
to
the
value
of
twenty
thousand
ducats
to
cortes
but
refused
any
interview
as
the
ships
could
not
ride
in
safety
at
st
juan
de
vilhua
cortes
sent
francis
de
montejo
and
the
pilot
antonio
alaminos
in
two
brigantines
to
look
out
for
a
safe
anchorage
they
went
to
panuco
in
lat
whence
they
came
back
to
culvacan
as
a
safer
harbour
but
cortes
went
by
land
westwards
to
a
city
named
zempoallan
where
he
was
well
received
from
thence
he
went
to
chiavitztlan
with
the
lord
of
which
town
and
of
all
the
surrounding
country
he
entered
into
a
league
against
muteçuma
on
the
arrival
of
his
ships
at
the
appointed
haven
he
went
there
and
built
a
town
which
he
named
rica
de
la
vera
from
thence
he
sent
a
vessel
to
spain
with
presents
and
a
letter
to
the
emperor
charles
giving
an
account
of
his
proceedings
and
of
his
determination
to
visit
muteçuma
and
soliciting
a
commission
as
governor
of
the
country
before
proceeding
on
his
march
to
mexico
cortes
destroyed
all
his
ships
lest
his
men
might
mutiny
as
they
seemed
disposed
and
leaving
spaniards
in
vera
cruz
with
as
many
indians
to
serve
them
he
began
his
march
going
first
to
zempoallan
he
learnt
that
francis
garay
was
on
the
coast
with
four
ships
and
he
contrived
to
inveigle
nine
of
his
men
from
whom
he
understood
that
garay
who
had
been
in
florida
was
now
at
the
river
panuco
where
he
had
got
some
gold
and
meant
to
remain
and
build
a
town
now
called
almeria
cortes
destroyed
the
idols
of
zempoallan
and
overthrew
the
tombs
of
their
kings
whom
the
people
worshipped
as
gods
and
exhorted
them
to
worship
the
true
god
he
set
out
from
zempoallan
for
mexico
on
the
of
august
and
after
three
days
march
came
to
the
city
of
zalapan
and
thence
to
another
named
sicuchimatl
at
both
of
which
places
he
was
well
received
and
was
offered
to
be
conducted
to
mexico
such
being
the
orders
of
muteçuma
going
from
thence
he
ascended
a
hill
three
leagues
high
on
which
vines
were
seen
growing
and
in
another
place
he
saw
above
a
thousand
load
of
wood
ready
cut
beyond
this
he
passed
a
plain
country
which
he
named
nombre
de
dios
at
the
foot
of
this
mountain
he
rested
his
troops
at
a
place
called
teuhixuacan
whence
through
a
desert
country
he
came
to
another
mountain
which
was
covered
with
snow
and
excessively
cold
and
where
the
troops
rested
in
a
town
named
zacotlan
marching
thus
from
town
to
town
he
arrived
at
a
territory
called
tlaxcallan
which
was
at
war
with
muteçuma
and
as
the
people
were
valiant
they
fought
against
cortes
but
at
length
they
agreed
and
formed
a
league
with
him
against
the
mexicans
thus
from
country
to
country
he
came
at
length
within
sight
of
mexico
and
muteçuma
being
afraid
received
him
kindly
giving
him
and
all
his
people
lodgings
in
the
capital
and
all
things
necessary
after
a
time
fearing
to
be
slain
cortes
made
muteçuma
prisoner
and
brought
him
to
his
own
quarters
keeping
him
under
a
secure
guard
cortes
inquired
at
muteçuma
the
extent
of
his
dominions
where
the
mines
of
gold
and
silver
were
and
the
number
of
kings
who
dwelt
in
the
land
and
joining
eight
intelligent
spaniards
with
an
equal
number
of
indians
he
sent
them
in
four
companies
to
travel
into
four
separate
countries
zucolla
malinaltepec
tenich
and
tututepec
the
messengers
to
zucolla
had
leagues
to
travel
and
those
who
went
to
malinaltepec
both
of
which
provinces
were
under
subjection
to
muteçuma
they
found
both
of
these
countries
fertile
and
well
peopled
and
they
brought
back
samples
of
gold
which
the
natives
found
in
the
rivers
the
country
of
tenich
was
at
war
with
muteçuma
and
would
not
admit
the
mexicans
into
their
country
but
they
sent
ambassadors
to
cortes
with
presents
offering
him
their
amity
at
which
muteçuma
was
much
displeased
those
who
went
to
tututepec
near
the
south
sea
brought
back
samples
of
gold
and
praised
the
pleasantness
of
the
country
reporting
that
there
were
many
good
harbours
on
the
coast
and
they
presented
to
cortes
a
beautiful
cloth
of
cotton
on
which
the
coast
with
all
its
harbours
and
creeks
was
distinctly
represented
but
at
this
time
by
the
coming
of
pamphilus
de
narvaez
the
whole
kingdom
of
mexico
was
thrown
into
confusion

wintered
in
that
place
where
he
and
his
people
endured
much
distress
from
snow
and
ice
and
extreme
cold
they
found
the
people
of
the
country
of
extraordinary
stature
and
great
strength
insomuch
that
they
took
men
by
the
legs
and
rent
them
asunder
as
easily
as
one
of
us
could
tear
a
hen
in
two
these
people
named
but
called
by
the
brazilians

four
months
they
came
into
lat
where
they
saw
numbers
of
seals
and
tunnies
and
the
climate
appeared
to
them
so
cold
and
inhospitable
that
partly
on
that
account
and
partly
owing
to
contrary
winds
they
returned
towards
tidore

people
were
much
caressed
by

afterwards
sent

examine
the
coast
but
they
could
find
no
good
harbour
after
a
survey
of
seventy
leagues
a
cacique
named

used
them
hospitably
and
sent
two
hundred
of
his

not

came
to
a
large
town
in
which
he
found
much
poultry
to
the
great
refreshment
of
his
troops
here
likewise
he
took
some
of

employed
as

arrived
at

found
no
provisions
the
country
having
been
exhausted
in
the
war
with

by
being
plundered
by
the
soldiers
from
this
place
he
sent

del
puerto
to
inquire
if
the
garrison
would
submit
to
his

sent
him
a
favourable
answer
but
by
means
of
an
ambush
they
made

against
aggression
and
dispatched
diego

the
to

thought
it
better

yield
himself
to

scarce
endure

them
they
found

certain
hills

produced
alum
and
one
out

country
but
he
was
lost
with
all
his
people
i
know
not
how
it
should
have
happened
except
by
the
righteous
judgment
of
god
that
so
little
should
now
remain
of
all
the
gold
and
precious
stones
which
were
got
in
the
antilles
by
the
spaniards
but
much
the
greater
part
has
been
dissipated
to
little
purpose
and
nothing
great
or
valuable
has
ensued
from
the
discovery
in
this
same
year
cortes
sent
a

venetian
sailed
from
seville
with
four
ships
intending
to
have
gone
to
the
moluccas
by
a
western
course
gabota
came
to
pernambuco
in
brasil
where
he
waited
three
months
for
a
favourable
wind
to
get
round
cape
st
augustine
in
the
bay
of
or
of
ducks
the
admirals
ship
was
lost
and
despairing
of
being
able
to
accomplish
the
voyage
to
the
moluccas
he
built
a
pinnace
for
the
purpose
of
exploring
the
rio
plata
gabota
accordingly
ran
sixty
leagues
or
miles
up
that
river
when
coming
to
a
bar
he
left
the
large
ships
there
and
went
with
the
boats
of
the
squadron
leagues
or
miles
farther
up
the
river
parana
which
the
inhabitants
considered
to
be
the
principal
river
he
here
constructed
a
fort
and
remained
in
that
place
above
a
year
from
thence
he
rowed
still
farther
up
the
parana
till
he
came
to
the
mouth
of
another
river
called
or
paraguay
and
perceiving
that
the
country
produced
gold
and
silver
he
kept
on
his
course
sending
one
of
the
boats
in
advance
which
was
taken
by
the
natives
on
this
gabota
thought
it
more
prudent
to
return
to
his
fort
after
having
penetrated
leagues
or
miles
up
this
river
he
took
on
board
the
people
he
had
left
at
the
fort
and
returning
to
the
ships
at
the
bar
sailed
back
to
seville
in
he
reported
that
the
rio
plata
was
navigable
for
a
great
way
and
that
it
rises
from
a
lake
named
in
the
kingdom
of
peru
whence
flowing
through
the
valleys
of
xauxa
it
receives
the
rivers
parso
bulcasban
cay
parima
hiacax
and
several
others
by
which
its
waters
are
greatly
increased
it
is
also
said
that
the
river
of
san
francesco
comes
from
the
same
lake
which
likewise
is
very
great
because
rivers
that
flow
from
lakes
are
larger
than
those
which
proceed
from
springs
in
the
year
panfilo
de
narvaez
sailed
from
st
lucar
de
barameda
with
five
ships
having
soldiers
horses
and
great
abundance
of
provisions
ammunition
and
all
other
necessaries
to
take
possession
of
florida
as
far
as
the
river
palmas
of
which
he
was
appointed
governor
not
being
able
to
land
at
the
place
he
wished
he
went
on
shore
with
of
his
soldiers
some
horses
and
a
supply
of
provisions
nearer
cape
florida
ordering
the
ships
to
proceed
to
the
river
palmas
in
which
voyage
they
were
nearly
all
lost
those
who
escaped
shipwreck
suffered
extreme
hardships
from
hunger
and
thirst
on
a
dry
barren
island
called
xamo
by
the
natives
and
which
the
spaniards
named
in
this
island
they
were
attacked
by
the
natives
and
many
both
of
the
spaniards
and
natives
were
slain
narvaez
and
his
people
saw
some
gold
among
the
indians
of
florida
who
said
they
had
it
from
he
therefore
went
to
that
town
in
search
of
gold
where
they
found
abundance
of
bay
trees
and
others
of
many
different
kinds
and
plenty
of
beasts
and
birds
but
neither
gold
nor
silver
from
apalachen
he
went
to
a
town
called
aute
and
from
thence
to
xamo
a
poor
and
barren
country
in
this
place
the
natives
requested
the
spaniards
to
cure
their
sick
of
whom
they
had
great
numbers
and
the
spaniards
being
in
extreme
poverty
and
distress
prayed
for
the
sick
and
used
such
endeavours
as
were
in
their
power
towards
their
relief
and
it
pleased
god
that
many
both
of
the
sick
and
those
who
were
ill
from
wounds
recovered
nay
even
one
that
was
supposed
to
be
dead
was
by
them
restored
to
life
owing
to
this
the
spaniards
were
greatly
esteemed
and
even
reputed
as
gods
so
that
the
people
offered
them
no
injury
and
even
gave
them
such
things
as
they
had
by
these
means
they
passed
through
many
countries
and
many
strange
nations
differing
from
each
other
in
language
customs
and
dress
and
came
at
length
among
a
people
that
lived
continually
among
their
flocks
and
herds
like
the
arabs
many
of
the
tribes
through
which
they
travelled
were
so
poor
as
to
feed
on
snakes
lizards
spiders
ants
and
all
kinds
of
vermin
yet
were
well
contented
with
their
hard
fore
and
were
much
given
to
singing
and
dancing
this
people
are
reported
to
purchase
all
their
wives
from
their
enemies
and
to
kill
all
their
own
daughters
lest
by
marrying
into
hostile
tribes
their
enemies
should
increase
in
numbers
in
some
places
the
women
continued
to
suckle
their
children
till
they
were
ten
or
twelve
years
old
and
there
were
certain
men
being
hermaphrodites
who
married
each
other
in
this
manner
the
spaniards
penetrated
above
leagues
or
miles
through
the
country
till
at
length
not
above
seven
or
eight
of
the
whole
armament
reached
the
city
of
st
michael
of
calvacan
in
lat
or
higher
on
the
coast
of
the
south
sea
learning
as
has
been
formerly
mentioned
that
garcia
de

had
passed
through
the
straits
of

on
a
voyage
to
the
of

fitted
out
three
ships
from

now
st

on
the
western
coast
of

intending
to
send
there
in

of
loaisa
and
that
they
might
discover
the
way
to
the
moluccas
and
open
up
the
spice
trade
with

leaving
civatlanejo
on
all

day
under
the
command
of
alvaro
de

ceron
the
cousin
of
cortes
they
fell
in
with
the
islands
formerly
discovered
by
magellan
which
he
had
named
whence
they
sailed
to
the
islands
which
had
been
discovered
by
gomez
de
sequeira
and
called
by
his
name
but
not
knowing
of
this
previous
discovery
he
named
them
de
los
or
the
isles
of
the
kings
because
discovered
on
twelfth
day
during
this
part
of
the
voyage
two
ships
of
the
squadron
separated
from
saavedra
and
were
never
more
heard
of
sailing
on
from
island
to
island
he
arrived
at
the
island
of
candiga
where
he
ransomed
two
spaniards
for
seventy
ducats
who
had
belonged
to
the
crew
of
loaisa
who
was
shipwrecked
in
that
neighbourhood
saavedra
reached
the
moluccas
in
march
and
anchored
at
the
island
of
gilolo
where
he
found
the
sea
calm
the
winds
moderate
and
no
tempests
and
he
estimated
the
distance
from
thence
to
new
spain
at
leagues
or
miles
at
this
period
fernando
de
la
torre
was
governor
of

molucca
islands
and
lived
in
the
city
of
tidore
having
been
chosen
instead
of
martin
yniguez
de
carquiçano
who
was
recently
dead
torre
waged
a
fierce
war
with
don
george
de
meneses
captain
of
the
portuguese
and
in
a
fight
of
the
fourth
of
may
saavedra
took
a
portuguese
galliot
and
slew
fernando
de
baldaya
the
captain
in
june
saavedra
set
sail
on
his
return
towards
new
spain
taking
with
him
simon
de
brito
patalin
and
other
portuguese
prisoners
but
after
several
months
sail
he
was
forced
back
to
tidore
by
contrary
winds
where
patalin
was
beheaded
and
quartered
and
the
rest
of
the
portuguese
prisoners
hanged
in
this
year
cortes
sent
infantry
and
sixty
cavalry
with
a
large
force
of
mexicans
to
explore
and
subdue
the
country
of
the
chihimecas
which
was
reported
to
be
rich
in
gold
he
then
took
shipping
for
spain
where
he
landed
with
great
pomp
bringing
with
him
marks
in
gold
and
silver
on
his
arrival
at
toledo
where
the
emperor
then
resided
he
was
very
graciously
received
the
emperor
created
him
marquis
and
married
him
to
the
lady
jane
de
zuniga
daughter
to
the
conde
de
aguilar
after
which
he
returned
to
resume
the
government
of
new
spain
saavedra
of
whom
we
have
lately
made
mention
returned
from
the
moluccas
towards
new
spain
in
may
and
during
the
voyage
came
in
sight
of
land
in
lat
he
ran
along
the
coast
to
the
from
that
time
to
the
end
of
august
upwards
of
leagues
finding
a
clean
coast
free
from
shoals
and
rocks
with
good
anchoring
ground
inhabited
by
a
black
people
with
curled
hair
the
people
of
the
moluccas
named
the
inhabitants
of
this
coast
because
they
are
black
with
frizzled
hair
and
both
portuguese
and
spaniards
have
adopted
the
same
name
having
reached
to
four
or
five
degrees
south
of
the
line
he
returned
northwards
and
near
the
equinoctial
he
discovered
an
island
which
he
called
los
or
of
the
painted
people
as
the
inhabitants
were
of
a
white
complexion
but
marked
with
a
hot
iron
and
from
various
circumstances
he
concluded
that
they
were
originally
from
china
a
kind
of
boat
put
off
from
the
shore
containing
a
number
of
these
islanders
making
many
threatening
signs
and
gestures
as
if
ordering
the
spaniards
to
go
away
from
their
land
and
even
proceeded
to
throw
stones
from
slings
at
the
ship
but
as
the
stones
did
no
harm
saavedra
would
not
allow
his
people
to
fire
upon
them
a
little
beyond
this
island
in
or
of
north
latitude
they
discovered
a
group
consisting
of
many
small
low
islands
covered
with
grass
and
full
of
palm
trees
to
which
they
gave
the
name
of
or
the
gardens
saavedra
came
to
anchor
in
the
midst
of
these
islands
where
he
remained
several
days
and
concluded
that
the
people
had
come
originally
from
china
but
had
by
long
residence
degenerated
into
lawless
savages
using
no
labour
or
industry
they
wear
a
species
of
white
cloth
made
of
grass
and
are
quite
ignorant
of
fire
which
put
them
in
great
terror
instead
of
bread
they
eat
cocoas
which
they
pull
unripe
burying
them
for
some
days
in
the
sand
and
then
laying
them
in
the
sun
which
causes
them
to
open
they
eat
fish
also
which
they
catch
from
a
kind
of
boat
called
or
which
they
construct
with
tools
made
of
shells
from
pine
wood
that
is
drifted
at
certain
times
to
their
islands
from
some
unknown
regions
the
wind
and
weather
becoming
more
favourable
for
his
return
to
new
spain
saavedra
resumed
his
voyage
thither
intending
to
have
gone
to
panama
to
unload
the
cloves
and
other
merchandize
he
had
brought
from
the
moluccas
his
purpose
was
to
have
carried
this
merchandize
in
carts
from
panama
about
four
leagues
or
sixteen
miles
overland
to
the
river
chagre
which
is
said
to
be
navigable
and
which
discharges
itself
into
the
north
sea
not
far
from
nombre
de
dios
where
the
goods
could
be
reshipped
for
spain
by
which
means
all
kind
of
goods
might
be
brought
from
india
in
a
shorter
time
and
with
less
danger
than
by
sailing
round
the
cape
of
good
hope
as
the
voyage
from
the
moluccas
to
panama
is
almost
a
perfectly
straight
course
between
the
line
and
the
tropics
but
in
the
present
voyage
they
were
never
able
to
procure
a
favourable
wind
and
were
therefore
forced
back
to
the
moluccas
where
they
arrived
in
great
affliction
as
saavedra
died
by
the
way
had
saavedra
lived
he
intended
to
have
opened
a
navigable
communication
from
sea
to
sea
through
the
land
of
castilia
del
oro
and
new
spain
which
might
have
been
done
in
one
or
other
of
the
following
places
from
the
gulph
of
st
michael
to
uraba
which
is
leagues
or
miles
from
panama
to
nombre
de
dios
which
is
leagues
or
miles
much
the
greater
part
consisting
of
the
river
chagre
navigable
for
small
craft
through
the
river
xaquator
now
st
juan
in
the
province
of
nicaragua
which
springs
out
of
a
lake
that
reaches
to
within
three
or
four
leagues
of
the
south
sea
and
falls
into
the
north
sea
being
navigable
by
large
boats
and
lighters
the
other
place
is
from
tecoantepec
through
a
river
to
verdadera
cruz
in
the
bay
of
honduras
in
the
year
damiano
de
goes
a
portuguese
travelled
over
all
spain
and
went
from
flanders
into
england
and
scotland
being
at
the
courts
of
the
kings
of
these
countries
after
that
he
returned
into
flanders
and
travelled
through

holland
brabant

and
through
the

and
other
parts
of

and
so
back
to

he
went

gascony
languedoc
dauphiny
and

passing
into

norway
penetrating
to

in
the
course
of
these
travels
which
occupied
him
during
years
he
saw
spoke
to
and
was
conversant
with
all
the
kings
princes
nobles
and
chief
cities
of
all
christendom
for
which
reason
i
thought
the
great
extent
of
his
travels
was
worthy
of
remembrance
in
or
melchior
de
sosa
tavarez
went
from
ormus
to
bassora
and
the
islands
of
gissara
with
some
ships
of
war
and
sailed
up
to
where
the
euphrates
and
tigris
unite
together
being
the
first
of
the
portuguese
who
had
sailed
so
far
on
the
fresh
water
in
these
parts
not
long
after
this
a
portuguese
named
ferdinando
coutinho
being
at
ormus
determined
to
return
overland
from
thence
to
portugal
for
this
purpose
he
went
to
arabia
and
up
the
river
euphrates
for
the
space
of
a
month
and
saw
many
countries
and
kingdoms
that
had
not
been
before
visited
by
the
portuguese
he
was
made
prisoner
at
damascus
whence
he
crossed
the
province
of
syria
to
the
city
of

he
had
been
at
the
holy
sepulchre
in
jerusalem
in
the
city
of
cairo
and
at
constantinople
where
the
great
turk
resides
after
seeing
that
court
he
passed
over
to
venice
and
from
thence
through
italy
france
and
spain
to
portugal
he
came
back
to
lisbon
this
person
and
damiano
de
goes
were
the
most
adventurous
of
the
portuguese
who
in
our
time
had
seen
and
discovered
the
greatest
extent
of
foreign
realms
for
their
own
satisfaction
about
the
year
francis
pizarro
who
has
been
already
mentioned
as
having
gone
to
spain
to
obtain
the
government
of
peru
returned
to
panama
having
procured
all
things
as
he
wished
carrying
with
him
four
brothers
ferdinand
john
gonsalvo
and
francis
martines
de
alcantara
they
were
not
well
received
by
diego
de
almagro
and
his
friends
because
pizarro
had
not
sufficiently
represented
his
merits
in
the
discovery
of
peru
to
the
emperor
in
which
he
had
lost
an
eye
but
took
the
whole
merit
to
himself
in
the
end
however
they
agreed
and
almagro
supplied
pizarro
with
seven
hundred
pezoes
of
gold
providing
him
likewise
with
provisions
and
ammunition
and
other
necessaries
towards
his
intended
expedition
against
peru
soon
after
this
arrangement
with
almagro
pizarro
and
his
four
brothers
set
out
with
such
soldiers
and
horses
as
they
could
procure
on
their
expedition
being
unable
from
contrary
winds
to
reach
tumbez
where
he
proposed
to
have
landed
he
was
under
the
necessity
of
disembarking
at
the
river
of
peru
whence
he
marched
along
the
coast
with
great
difficulty
on
account
of
many
rivers
and
marshes
in
which
some
of
his
men
were
drowned
in
crossing
coming
to
the
town
of
coache
they
found
much
gold
and
emeralds
in
that
place
some
of
which
they
broke
to
see
if
they
were
perfect
from
thence
pizarro
sent
twenty
thousand
pezoes
of
gold
to
almagro
at
panama
to
enable
him
to
send
supplies
of
men
horses
ammunition
and
provisions
and
went
from
coache
to
the
haven
named
where
he
was
joined
by
sebastian
benalcazar
with
all
the
supplies
he
had
sent
for
in
the
year
after
the
arrival
of
these
reinforcements
pizarro
passed
over
from
porto
viejo
to
the
rich
island
of
puna
in
the
bay
of
guayaquil
where
he
was
outwardly
well
received
by
the
governor
who
yet
conspired
to
kill
him
and
his
men
but
pizarro
prevented
him
and
took
many
of
the
indians
whom
he
bound
with
chains
of
gold
and
silver
such
was
the
jealousy
of
the
governor
of
puna
that
he
caused
those
who
had
the
charge
of
his
wives
to
have
their
noses
and
privities
cut
off
in
this
place
pizarro
found
above
six
hundred
prisoners
belonging
to
king
atabalipa
who
was
then
at
war
with
his
eldest
brother
guascar
pizarro
set
these
prisoners
at
liberty
on
promise
of
procuring
him
a
friendly
reception
in
peru
but
they
forgot
their
engagements
afterwards
and
excited
the
people
to
war
against
the
spaniards
from
puna
pizarro
sent
three
spaniards
to
tumbez
in
peru
to
treat
of
amity
but
the
peruvians
seized
them
and
put
them
to
death
on
hearing
of
this
cruel
action
pizarro
crossed
over
to
the
main
and
made
a
sudden
attack
during
the
night
on
the
city
of
tumbez
killing
great
numbers
of
the
inhabitants
the
remainder
submitted
and
made
peace
presenting
him
large
gifts
of
gold
and
silver
and
other
riches
pizarro
then
built
a
town
on
the
river
cira
which
he
named
st
michael
of
tangarara
which
was
the
first
habitation
of
the
christians
in
these
parts
and
he
appointed
sebastian
de
benalcazar
to
the
command
after
this
he
made
search
for
a
secure
haven
on
the
coast
and
found
one
every
way
to
his
wish
at
payta
in
the
same
year
diego
de
ordas
went
with
soldiers
and
horses
to
settle
the
country
on
the
maranon
or
river
of
the
amazons
but
dying
on
the
voyage
this
expedition
proved
fruitless
afterwards
in
the
year
hierom
artal
was
sent
thither
with
soldiers
yet
he
came
not
to
the
river
but
formed
settlements
at
michael
de
and
other
places
in
paria
aries
a
portuguese
gentleman
went
likewise
to
the
maranon
with
ten
ships
men
and
horses
where
he
spent
much
and
did
little
to
purpose
but
the
greatest
loser
in
this
expedition
was
john
de
barros
this
great
river
maranon
is
in
lat
its
mouth
being
leagues
or
miles
across
with
many
inhabited
islands
on
which
there
are
many
trees
producing
incense
much
larger
than
those
of
arabia
it
produces
gold
and
precious
stones
and
an
emerald
was
found
there
as
large
as
the
palm
of
the
hand
the
people
of
that
country
make
a
kind
of
drink
of
a
species
of
oats
that
are
as
large
as

was
sent
from

baggage
and
provisions
to
discover
and
subdue

ceintiliquipac
ciametlan
tovalla
cnixo
ciamolla
culhuacan
and
other
places
on
this
expedition
he
marched
through
mechuacan
where
he
acquired
much
gold
and
marks
of
silver
to
the
country
of
xalisco
he
gave
the
name
of
new
galicia
because
it
was
rugged
and
mountainous
and
the
people
robust
and
hardy
he
built
many
towns
in
the
conquered
countries
particularly
compostella
guadalajara
after
the
place
of
his
own
birth
in
spain
santo

sent
diego
hurtado
de

in
two
ships
from
acapulco
which
is
leagues
from

on
purpose
to
explore
the
coast
of
the
south
sea
as
he
had
been
ordered
to
do
by
the
emperor
mendoça
sailed
from
acapulco
to
the
harbour
of
xalisco
or
xalis
on
the
river
barania
in
lat
where
he
wished
to
take
in
wood
and
water
but
he
was
resisted
there
by
the
orders
of
nunnes
de
gusman
and
obliged
to
proceed
on
his
voyage
some
of
his
men
mutinied
and
he
put
them
all
on
board
one
of
his
ships
that
they
might
return
to
new
spain
being
in
want
of
water
these
people
put
in
at
the
bay
of
vanderas
not
far
south
from
xalis
where
they
were
all
slain
by
the
indians
in
this
voyage
of
discovery
hurtado
sailed
leagues
along
the
coast
but
did
nothing
worthy
of
being
recorded
in
pizarro
went
from
tumbez
to
caxamalca
where
he
took
king
atabalipa
prisoner
who
engaged
to
pay
a
vast
sum
in
gold
and
silver
for
his
ransom
on
purpose
to
procure
this
pedro
de
varco
and
ferdinando
do
sotto
were
sent
to
the
city
of
cusco
in
lat
a
journey
of
leagues
all
upon
causeways
of
stone
with
bridges
wherever
necessary
and
having
at
proper
distances
for
the
conveniency
of
the
by
which
name
the
kings
of
peru
are
distinguished
the
armies
of
the
peruvians
are
very
numerous
as
they
often
bring
more
than
men
into
the
field
and
they
lodge
on
these
causeways
as
already
mentioned
where
they
always
have
abundance
of
provisions
and
other
necessaries
as
is
said
to
be
the
custom
in
china
ferdinando
pizarro
went
with
some
horsemen
to
paciacama
leagues
from
caxamalca
to
discover
the
country
and
on
his
return
he
learnt
that
guascar
the
brother
of
atabalipa
had
been
put
to
death
by
his
command
and
that
ruminaguy
the
general
of
the
army
of
atabalipa
had
risen
in
arms
in
the
city
of
quito
against
the
spaniards
after
the
reception
of
this
intelligence
atabalipa
was
strangled
by
the
orders
of
pizarro
after
the
death
of
the
two
kings
of
the
peruvians
pizarro
continually
extended
his
authority
over
the
dominions
of
peru
and
built
many
cities
towns
and
forts
in
convenient
situations
to
hold
the
country
under
subjection
he
detached
sebastian
de
benalcazar
whom
he
had
before
made
governor
of
st
michael
de
tangarara
with
infantry
and
horse
to
quito
against
ruminaguy
benalcazar
proceeded
successfully
in
reducing
the
country
to
subjection
from
one
city
to
another
eastwards
for
leagues
not
far
from
the
equinoctial
line
where
peter
alvarado
found
certain
mountains
so
cold
and
loaded
with
such
quantities
of
snow
that
of
his
men
were
frozen
to
death
having
reduced
the
city
of
quito
he
established
himself
and
his
people
in
that
place
calling
it
the
city
of
st
francis
and
it
seemed
very
strange
to
the
spaniards
to
find
in
that
country
abundance
of
cattle
wheat
barley
and
other
plants
similar
to
those
of
spain
after
sending
benalcazar
to
reduce
the
city
of
quito
pizarro
himself
undertook
to
reduce
the
royal
residence
of
cusco
in
about
in
which
expedition
he
was
opposed
by
quisquiz
a
peruvian
general
whom
he
easily
defeated
and
he
soon
afterwards
took
possession
of
cusco
the
exceedingly
rich
and
wealthy
capital
of
the
peruvian
monarchy
about
this
time
mango
a
brother
of
atabalipa
joined
pizarro
who
made
him
ynga
or
king
of
the
country
in
name
only
while
he
assumed
the
whole
authority
and
revenues
of
the
kingdom
to
himself
in
the
same
year
jaques
cartier
a
native
of
britanny
went
with
three
ships
to
the
land
of
corterealis
and
the
gulf
of
st
lawrence
otherwise
called
or
the
square
gulf
which
he
fell
in
with
in
lat
he
proceeded
northwards
to
the
latitude
of
in
the
hope
of
being
able
to
penetrate
in
that
direction
to
china
by
a
west
passage
to
bring
drugs
and
other
merchandize
from
thence
to
france
next
year
cartier
made
a
second
voyage
to
the
same
regions
and
found
the
country
pervaded
by
many
large
rivers
and
abounding
in
provisions
he
sailed
leagues
up
one
of
these
rivers
in
a
direction
and
named
the
country
new
france
now
canada
but
finding
the
water
to
become
fresh
he
was
satisfied
there
could
be
no
passage
that
way
to
the
south
sea
and
having
wintered
in
the
country
he
returned
next
year
to
france
about
the
end
of
the
year
or
beginning
of
don
anthony
de
mendoça
came
from
spain
to
the
city
of
mexico
as
viceroy
of
new
spain
being
appointed
to
supersede
cortes
the
discoverer
and
conqueror
of
that
rich
and
extensive
territory
at
this
time
cortes
was
absent
from
the
seat
of
government
having
gone
to
tecoantepec
on
purpose
to
fit
out
two
ships
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
these
he
sent
out
under
the
command
of
fernando
de
grijalva
and
diego
bezerra
de
mendoça
the
former
having
a
portuguese
pilot
named
acosta
and
the
pilot
to
the
latter
being
fortunio
ximenez
a
biscayan
on
the
first
night
after
leaving
tecoantepec
the
two
ships
separated
ximenez
raised
a
mutiny
against
his
captain
in
which
bezerra
was
slain
and
many
of
the
crew
wounded
some
time
afterwards
ximenez
went
on
shore
in
the
bay
of
santa
cruz
for
wood
and
water
where
he
and
more
than
of
his
people
were
slain
by
the
indians
two
of
the
mariners
who
were
in
the
boat
escaped
to
xalisco
and
told
nunnes
de
gusman
who
commanded
at
that
place
that
they
had
seen
indications
of
pearls
during
the
voyage
gusman
went
accordingly
with
a
ship
in
search
of
pearls
and
explored
above
leagues
of
the
coast
it
is
said
that
grijalva
sailed
leagues
from
tecoantepec
without
seeing
any
land
except
one
small
island
in
to
which
he
gave
the
name
st
thomas
as
having
been
discovered
on
the
day
of
that
saint
in
the
year
pizarro
built
the
city
which
he
named
de
los
or
of
the
kings
on
the
river
of
lima
in
lat
s
to
which
he
removed
the
inhabitants
of
xauxa
as
a
more
convenient
situation
for
the
residence
of
the
government
and
in
a
better
country
he
built
also
the
city
of
st
jago
in
porto
viejo
and
many
other
towns
both
along
the
coast
and
in
the
inland
country
and
he
procured
from

horses
asses
mules
cattle
hogs

wheat
barley

diego
de
almagro
went
from
the
city
of
cusco
to
the
provinces
of
arequipa
and
chili
in
lat
the
march
was
of
great
length
and
he
discovered
a
great
extent
of
country
but
he
suffered
great
extremities
of
cold
hunger
and
fatigue
in
consequence
of
the
ruggedness
of
the
mountains
and
the
ice
and
snow
insomuch
that
many
of
his
men
and
horses
were
frozen
to

his
government
by

a
civil
war
was
kindled
between
him
and
pizarro
on
this
march
he
and
his
people
were
severely
oppressed
by
famine
and
were
even
forced
to
feed
upon
their
horses
which
had
died
four
months
and
a
half
before
when
on
their
march
southwards
into

a
renegado
named

was
captain
the

came
to
the
bar
of
the
great

indus
in
december
where
the
same
phenomena
were
observed
as
were
formerly
experienced
by
alexander
according
to
the
relation
of
quintus
curtius
in
the
same
year
simon
de
alcazava
sailed
from
seville
with
two
ships
and
men
some
say
he
was
destined
for
new
spain
others
for
the
moluccas

others
again
that
he
meant
to
have
proceeded
for
china
where
he
had
formerly
been
along
with

however
this
may
have
been
he
went
first
to
the
canaries
and
from
thence
to
the
straits
of
magellan
without
touching
at
brazil
or
any
other
part
of
the

america
and
entered
into
these
straits
in
the
month
of
december
having
contrary
winds
and
very
cold
weather
under
these
difficulties
the
soldiers
entreated
him
to
turn
back
which
he
refused
and
went
into
a
haven
on
the
south
side
of
the
straits
in
lat
where
he
ordered
roderigo
de
isla
to
land
with
of
the
people
to
explore
the
country
but
the
people
mutinied
against
alcazava
and
slew
him
and
having
appointed
such
captains
and
officers
as
they
thought
proper
they
returned
back
in
their
voyage
homewards
one
of
the
ships
was
lost
on
the
coast
of
brazil
and
such
of
the
spaniards
as
escaped
drowning
were
killed
and
eaten
by
the
savages

men
being
the
largest
armament
both
of
ships
and
men
that
had
ever
been
sent
from

to
the
new
world
mendoça
died
on
his
return
to
spain
but
most
part
of
his
men
remained
in
the
country
on
the
rio
plata
where
they
built
a
large
city
containing
now
houses
in
which
great
numbers
of
indians
dwell
along
with
the
spaniards
from
this
place
they
discovered
and
conquered
the
country
to
a
great
extent
even
to
the
mines
of
potosi
and
the
town
of
la
plata
which
is
at
the
distance
of

ayres
cortes
having
learnt
in
the
year
that
his
ship
of
which
fortunio
ximenez
was
pilot
had
been
seized
by
nunnez
de
guzman
sent
three
ships
to
xalisco
while
he
marched
thither
by
land
with
a
respectable
force
and
on
his
arrival
there
he
found
his
ship
all
spoiled
and
rifled
when
his
small
squadron
was
come
round
to
xalisco
he
went
himself
on
board
and
left
andrew
de
tapia
to
command
his
land
force
setting
sail
from
thence
he
came
on
the
first
of
may
to
a
point
of
land
which
he
named
cape
st
philip
and
to
an
island
close
by
this
cape
he
gave
the
name
of
st
jago
three
days
afterwards
he
came
to
the
bay
where
the
pilot
ximenez
was
killed
which
he
named
bahia
de
santa
cruz
where
he
went
on
land
and
sent
out
andrew
de
tapia
to
explore
the
country
cortes
again
set
sail
and
came
to
the
river
now
called
de
san
pedro
y
san
where
the
ships
were
separated
by
a
tempest
one
was
driven
to
the
bay
of

another
to
the
river
of
guajaval
and
the
third
was
stranded
on
the
coast
near
xalisco
whence
the
crew
went
overland
to
mexico
after
waiting
a
long
while
for
his
other
two
ships
cortes
made
sail
and
entered
into
the
gulf
of
california
otherwise
called
or
the
vermilion
sea
and
by
some
the
sea
of
cortes
having
penetrated
leagues
within
that
gulf
he
espied
a
ship
riding
at
an
anchor
and
on
his
approach
towards
her
had
nearly
been
lost
if
he
had
not
received
assistance
from
that
other
ship
having
repaired
his
own
ship
he
departed
from
thence
with
both
ships
and
having
procured
provisions
at
a
very
dear
rate
at
st
michael
de
culiacan
he
went
to
the
harbour
of
santa
cruz
where
he
received
information
that
don
antonio
de
mendoça
had
arrived
from
spain
as
viceroy
of
mexico
he
therefore
left
francis
de
ulloa
with
the
command
of
his
ships
ordering
him
to
proceed
on
discoveries
and
going
to
acapulco
he
received
a
messenger
from
don
antonio
de
mendoça
the
new
viceroy
certifying
his
arrival
and
the
assumption
of
his
authority
mendoça
likewise
sent
him
the
copy
of
a
letter
from
francis
pizarro
stating
that
mango
the
inca
of
peru
had
risen
in
arms
and
assailed
the
city
of
cusco
with
fighting
men
having
slain
his
brother
john
pizarro
and
above
spaniards
with
horses
and
that
he
himself
and
the
spanish
dominions
in
peru
were
in
imminent
danger
unless
speedily
and
effectually
assisted
cortes
not
yet
resolved
on
submitting
to
the
authority
of
mendoça
fitted
out
two
ships
under
the
command
of
ferdinando
de
grijalva
and
one
alvarado
on
purpose
to
discover
the
route
to
the
moluccas
by
the
way
of
the
equinoctial
line
because
the
islands
of
cloves
are
under
that
parallel
they
went
first
to
st
michael
de
tangarara
in
peru
where
they
landed
succours
for
pizarro
and
thence
all
along
the
line
to
the
moluccas
as
they
were
ordered
and
they
are
said
to
have
sailed
above
leagues
without
sight
of
land
on
either
side
the
whole
way
at
length
in
lat
they
discovered
an
island
named
which
was
believed
to
be
one
of
the
islands
of
cloves
five
hundred
leagues
farther
more
or
less
they
came
to
another
which
they
named
de
los
or
island
of
fishers
going
still
in
the
same
course
they
saw
another
island
called
on
the
south
side
of
the
line
and
another
named
after
which
they
came
in
sight
of
turning
one
degree
to
the
north
they
came
to
anchor
at
an
island
named
whence
they
came
to
another
under
the
line
named
and
thence
to
still
holding
on
the
same
course
the
people
of
all
these
islands
are
black
with
frizzled
hair
whom
the
people
of
the
moluccas
call
papuas
most
of
them
are
witches
and
eat
human
flesh
and
are
so
much
given
to
wickedness
that
the
devils
walk
among
them
as
companions
yet
when
these
wicked
spirits
find
any
of
the
papuas
alone
they
kill
him
with
cruel
blows
or
smother
him
for
which
reason
they
always
go
out
in
companies
of
two
or
three
together
there
is
in
this
country
a
bird
as
large
as
a
crane
which
has
no
wings
wherewith
to
fly
but
runs
on
the
ground
with
the
swiftness
of
a
deer
and
of
the
small
feathers
of
this
bird
the
natives
make
hair
for
their
idols
they
have
likewise
a
particular
herb
the
leaf
of
which
after
being
washed
in
warm
water
if
laid
on
any
member
and
licked
with
the
tongue
will
even
draw
out
the
whole
blood
of
a
mans
body
and
by
means
of
this
leaf
the
natives
let
blood
of
themselves
when
afflicted
by
sickness
from
these
islands
they
came
to
others
named
the
in
lat
and
from
the
island
of
ternate
in
which
the
portuguese
have
a
fortress
these
islands
are
leagues
from
the
island
of
and
between
forty
and
fifty
leagues
from
ternate
from
thence
they
went
to
the
island
of
and
the
islands
of
cloves
going
about
from
one
island
to
another
but
the
natives
would
not
permit
them
to
land
desiring
them
to
go
to
the
fortress
where
captain
the
author
of
this
work
would
receive
them
in
a
friendly
manner
who
was
as
they
stiled
him
of
the
country
and
they
could
not
be
allowed
to
land
without
his
license
this
circumstance
is
worthy
of
being
noticed
that
the
natives
were
so
well
affected
to
the
portuguese
as
to
venture
their
lives
with
their
wives
children
and
goods
in
their
service
in
the
year
john
de
vadillo
the
governor
of
carthagena
went
with
a
powerful
armament
from
the
port
called
sebastian
de
buena
in
the
gulf
of
uraba
to
the
rio
verde
whence
he
went
by
land
without
previously
knowing
any
part
of
the
way
and
without
carriages
to
the
very
extremity
of
peru
and
the
town
of
la
plata
a
distance
of
leagues
a
most
memorable
journey
the
whole
country
from
the
rio
verde
to
the
mountains
of
abibe
is
full
of
rugged
hills
thick
forests
and
many
rivers
through
which
they
had
to
pierce
their
way
with
infinite
toil
the
mountains
of
abibe
are
said
to
be
twenty
leagues
broad
and
can
only
be
passed
over
in
the
months
of
january
february
march
and
april
as
from
incessant
heavy
rains
at
all
other
times
of
the
year
the
rivers
are
so
swelled
as
to
be
quite
impassable
in
these
mountains
there
are
many
herds
of
swine
many
dantes
lions
tigers
bears
ounces
large
monkeys
vast
snakes
and
other
vermin
there
are
also
abundance
of
partridges
quails
pigeons
and
other
birds
of
many
different
kinds
the
rivers
also
were
so
full
of
fish
that
they
killed
them
with
staves
and
they
affirmed
if
they
had
been
provided
with
rods
and
nets
that
a
very
large
company
of
men
might
be
subsisted
without
ever
being
in
distress
for
want
of
food
in
this
expedition
they
noted
the
diversities
of
people
languages
dress
and
other
circumstances
during
the
whole
way
through
many
countries
kingdoms
and
provinces
and
the
great
difficulties
and
dangers
they
encountered
till
their
arrival
at
the
de
la
and
the
adjoining
sea
this
was
the
most
extensive
discovery
which
has
been
ever
heard
of
by
land
and
in
so
short
a
time
insomuch
that
if
it
had
not
been
performed
in
our
own
days
it
could
hardly
have
been
credited
in
certain
friars
of
the
order
of
st
francis
went
from
mexico
to
preach
to
the
natives
in
the
northern
part
of
new
spain
and
to
convert
them
to
the
catholic
faith
one
mark
de
nizza
penetrated
farther
than
any
of
the
passing
through
culvacan
or
culiacan
he
came
into
the
province
of
sibola
or
cinaloa
where
he
pretended
to
have
found
seven
cities
and
that
the
farther
he
went
the
richer
was
the
country
in
gold
silver
and
precious
stones
with
many
sheep
bearing
wool
of
great
fineness
on
the
fame
of
this
wealth
the
viceroy
don
antonio
de
mendoça
and
cortes
determined
to
send
a
force
to
take
possession
of
the
country
but
as
they
could
not
agree
on
this
subject
cortes
and
his
wife
went
over
to
spain
in
where
he
died
seven
years
afterwards
in
i
antonio
galvano
being
governor
of
the
molucca
islands
sent
a
ship
commanded
by
francis
de
castro
towards
the
north
with
orders
to
convert
as
many
as
he
could
to
the
christian
faith
castro
himself
baptized
many
as
the
lords
of
celebes
maccassar
amboina
moro
moratax
and
of
several
other
places
on
his
arrival
at
the
island
of
mindanao
six
kings
received
the
water
of
baptism
from
de
castro
with
their
wives
children
and
subjects
and
i
gave
orders
that
most
of
these
should
receive
the
name
of
john
in
honour
of
king
john
iii
who
then
reigned
in
portugal
the
portuguese
and
spaniards
who
have
been
in
these
islands
affirm
that
there
are
in
them
a
certain
species
of
hogs
which
besides
the
ordinary
teeth
in
their
jaws
have
two
others
growing
out
of
their
snouts
and
other
two
behind
their
ears
of
a
large
span
and
in
length
there
is
likewise
said
to
be
a
certain
tree
that
part
of
which
that
grows
towards
the
east
is
a
sure
antidote
against
all
kinds
of
poison
while
the
western
half
of
the
same
tree
is
itself
a
deadly
poison
the
fruit
of
this
tree
is
like
large
pease
of
which
is
made
the
strongest
poison
on
earth
there
is
another
tree
of
a
very
singular
nature
for
if
any
one
eat
of
its
fruit
he
becomes
twelve
hours
mad
and
on
regaining
his
senses
can
not
remember
any
thing
that
happened
during
his
madness
there
are
likewise
certain
which
have
the
same
effect
of
producing
temporary
madness
when
eaten
the
islanders
also
pretend
that
there
is
a
certain
stone
in
these
islands
of
so
wonderful
a
property
that
whoever
happens
to
sit
upon
it
is
sure
to
be
afflicted
with
rupture
it
is
farther
worthy
of
remark
that
the
inhabitants
of
these
islands
gild
their
teeth
in
the
year
three
ships
which
had
been
ordered
by
cortes
to
discover
the
coast
northwards
from
culiacan
and
which
sailed
from
acapulco
under
the
command
of
francis
ulloa
having
touched
at
jago
de
buena
entered
into
the
gulf
of
california
which
cortes
discovered
and
sailed
up
that
gulf
till
they
came
almost
to
the
farther
end
of
it
in
lat
at
a
place
which
they
named
de
san
because
they
came
there
on
the
day
of
that
saint
they
returned
southward
along
the
other
or
western
coast
of
the
gulf
of
california
and
having
doubled
the
point
of
that
peninsula
called
de
san
within
certain
islands
they
sailed
northwards
along
the
external
coast
of
california
till
they
again
reached
to
the
same
latitude
of
whence
they
returned
into
new
spain
forced
to
this
measure
by
contrary
winds
and
want
of
provisions
after
having
been
absent
a
whole
year
on
this
voyage
in
these
discoveries
cortes
expended
ducats
according
to
his
own
account
cortes
and
his
captains
explored
the
coast
of
new
spain
from
the
lat
of
to
or
leagues
all
of
which
was
rather
warm
than
cold
although
snow
is
found
on
some
of
the
mountains
for
the
greater
part
of
every
year
from
cabo
del
enganno
to
cabo
de
liampa
in
china
the
distance
is
or
leagues
in
new
spain
there
are
many
trees
flowers
and
fruits
of
various
kinds
that
are
useful
to
man
the
principal
tree
is
named
which
does
not
grow
either
very
tall
or
very
thick
the
natives
plant
and
dress
this
tree
as
we
do
our
vines
and
they
allege
that
it
has
forty
different
kinds
of
leaves
resembling
woven
cloth
which
serve
for
many
useful
purposes
when
tender
these
leaves
are
made
into
conserves
from
it
they
make
a
kind
of
paper
and
a
substance
like
flax
and
it
is
also
manufactured
into
mantles
mats
shoes
girdles
and
cordage
this
tree
produces
such
strong
and
sharp
prickles
that
they
are
used
instead
of
needles
for
sewing
the
roots
are
used
as
fuel
and
their
ashes
make
excellent
ley
for
the
manufacture
of
soap
the
natives
open
up
the
earth
from
the
roots
of
this
tree
and
by
scraping
or
wounding
them
they
extract
a
juice
which
is
a
rich
syrup
by
boiling
this
juice
it
is
converted
into
honey
and
when
purified
it
becomes
sugar
and
may
likewise
be
made
into
wine
and
vinegar
the
fruit
of
this
tree
is
called
the
rind
roasted
crushed
and
applied
to
sores
or
wounds
has
a
most
healing
quality
the
juice
of
the
roots
and
tops
mixed
with
incense
is
a
sovereign
antidote
against
the
bite
of
a
viper
and
other
poisons
from
all
these
useful
properties
this
is
the
most
profitable
tree
that
is
known
in
these
parts
there
are
certain
birds
in
new
spain
called
vicmalim
having
a
long
small
bill
which
live
on
dew
and
the
juice
of
roses
and
other
flowers
their
feathers
are
very
small
and
of
beautiful
colours
and
are
much
esteemed
to
work
up
into
ornaments
with
gold
these
birds
die
or
sleep
rather
every
year
in
the
month
of
october
sitting
on
a
small
bough
in
some
warm
and
close
place
and
they
revive
again
in
the
month
of
april
when
the
flowers
appear
there
are
snakes
likewise
in
this
country
which
sound
as
if
they
had
bells
attached
to
them
when
they
creep
along
there
are
other
snakes
also
which
are
said
to
engender
by
the
mouth
as
vipers
are
reported
to
do
with
us
there
are
likewise
certain
hogs
which
have
a
navel
on
the
ridge
of
the
back
which
the
hunters
cut
out
the
moment
they
are
killed
as
otherwise
the
carcase
would
corrupt
and
stink
so
as
to
be
uneatable
besides
which
there
are
certain
fishes
which
are
named
because
they
make
a
snorting
noise
like
hogs
in
the
year
a
civil
war
broke
out
in
peru
between
pizarro
and
almagro
in
the
course
of
which
almagro
was
taken
prisoner
and
beheaded
after
which
in
the
year
pizarro
sent
peter
to
baldivia
into
chili
where
he
was
at
first
well
received
but
the
people
afterwards
rose
against
him
and
sought
to
put
him
to
death
by
treason
notwithstanding
the
long
and
severe
war
he
had
to
wage
against
the
natives
of
chili
baldivia
explored
the
country
to
a
great
extent
discovering
the
whole
coast
as
far
as
lat
and
even
further
while
baldivia
was
occupied
in
these
discoveries
he
received
intelligence
of
a
king
called
who
commonly
brought
men
into
the
field
when
engaged
in
war
against
another
neighbouring
king
lucengolma
was
likewise
said
to
have
a
temple
in
an
island
in
which
there
were
priests
it
was
farther
reported
that
beyond
the
dominions
of
this
king
there
lay
a
country
inhabited
by
a
nation
of
amazons
whose
queen
was
named
which
signifies
golden
but
hitherto
these
things
rest
merely
on
report
and
have
not
been
ascertained
for
truth
by
actual
discovery
about
this
time
gomez
de
alvarado
reduced
the
province
of

often
vexed
the

was
subdued
by
peter

peranzures
went
also
on
an
expedition
into
the
same
country
in
this
manner
the
spaniards
dispersed
themselves
over
the
whole
country
and
conquered
an
extent
of
more
than
leagues
yet
not
without
much
labour
and
considerable
loss
of
men
the
countries
of
brazil
and
peru
stand
east
and
west
from
each
other
their
coasts
being
almost
leagues
distant
at
the
nearest
points
which
are
the
cape
of
st
augustine
and
the
harbour
of
truxillo
nearly
in
the
same
parallel
of
latitude
the
greatest
extent
of
peru
measuring
from
the
river
of
peru
in
the
north
to
the
straits
of
magellan
in
the
south
is
leagues
through
the
whole
of
this
country
certain
mountains
called
the
andes
extend
from
north
to
south
which
divide
brazil
on
the
east
from
peru
or
the
empire
of
the
incas
on
the
west
in
the
same
manner
the
mountains
of
taurus
and
imaus
divide
asia
into
two
parts
which
mountains
begin
on
the
mediterranean
in
or
degrees
of
north
latitude
over
against
the
islands
of
rhodes
and
cyprus
and
extend
eastwards
to
the
sea
of
china
thus
likewise
the
mountains
of
atlas
in
africa
divide
the
moors
from
the
moors
or
negroes

hair
these
mountains
begin
at
mount
near
the
desert
of

and
extend
under
the
tropic
of
cancer
to
the
atlantic
the
mountains
of
the
andes
are
high
and
rugged
and
barren
in
some
places
without
trees
or
even
grass
and
it
almost
always
either
rains
or
snows
on
their
highest
ranges
accompanied
with
sudden
and
violent
tempests
of
wind
there
is
so
great
a
scarcity
of
wood
in
these
parts
that
the
inhabitants
use
turf
or
peats
for
fuel
as
is
done
in
flanders
in
these
mountains
and
countries
the
soil
is
in
some
places
black
in
others
white
or
red
blue
green
yellow
and
violet
and
with
some
of
these
earths
the
natives
dye
various
colours
without
using
any
other
mixture
from
the
bottoms
of
these
mountains
but
principally
on
the
east
side
there
flow
many

and
many
others

pervade
the
country

are
much
larger
than
those

the
country
of
peru
between
the
andes
and
the
western
sea
or
pacific
is
from
to
leagues
in
breadth
all
of
a
hot
sandy
soil
yet
fertile
as
being
well
watered
and
produces
many
excellent
trees
and
fruits
it
produces
many
turnips
rapes
and
other
such
herbs
and
roots
likewise
abundance
of
flags
rushes
herbs
and
flowers
of
so
loose
and
tender
a
texture
that
the
leaves
drop
off
on
the
slightest
touch
among
these
herbs
and
fresh
flowers
the
natives
often
dwell
without
beds
or
houses
even
like
cattle
in
the
fields
and
some
of
them
have
tails
these
people
are
gross
and
wear
long
hair
but
have
no
beards
and
they
speak
divers
languages
one
of
the
plants
of
this
region
called
resembles
rue
and
bears
a
yellow
flower
which
cures
all
kinds
of
rotten
sores
yet
if
applied
to
sound
flesh
will
eat
it
to

they
say
that
these
mountains
abound
in
tigers
lions

wolves
cats
foxes
dantes
ounces
hogs
and
deer
and
with
many
birds
both
ravenous
and
others
most
of
them
being
black
while
under
the
north
both
birds
and
beasts
are
mostly
white
there
are
also
great
numbers
of
large
and
terrible
snakes
which
are
said
to
have
destroyed
a
whole
army
of
one
of
the
incas
that
was
marching
this
way
yet
according
to
report
an
old
woman
did
so
enchant
them
that
they
became
quite
harmless
and
gentle
insomuch
that
they
would
allow
people
to
sit
upon
them
it
is
reported
that
from
tumbez
to
chili
there
are
no
peacocks
hens
cocks
nor
any
eagles
hawks
kites
or
other
ravenous
birds
but
there
are
many
ducks
geese
herns
pigeons
partridges
quails
and
many
other
kinds
of
birds
there
is
likewise
a
certain
fowl
like
a
duck
which
has
no
wings
but
is
covered
all
over
with
fine
thin
feathers
a
certain
species
of
bitterns
are
said
to
make
war
upon
the
or
seal
for
when
this
bird
finds
them
on
land
it
tries
to
pick
out
their
eyes
that
they
may
not
see
their
way
back
to
the
water
and
then
kills
them
and
the
fight
between
the
bitterns
and
the
seals
is
said
to
be
a
pleasant
sight
those
who
live
on
the
tops
of
the
andes
between
the
cold
and
the
heat
are
mostly
blind
of
one
eye
and
some
are
totally
blind
so
that
hardly
can
two
men
be
found
but
one
of
them
at
least
is
half
blind
notwithstanding
the
great
heat
of
the
sand
in
peru
it
yields
good
crops
of
maize
and
potatoes
and
an
herb
called
which
the
natives
carry
continually
in
their
mouths
as
those
in
the
east
indies
do
and
which
they
say
satisfies
both
hunger
and
thirst
it
is
affirmed
that
from
tumbez
southwards
for
the
space
of
leagues
there
is
neither
rain
thunder
nor
lightning
with
only
some
light
showers
in
peru
there
are
certain
animals
called
by
the
natives
and
sheep
by
the
spaniards
because
they
are
covered
with
wool
but
their
shape
resembles
that
of
deer
and
they
have
saddle
backs
like
a
camel
and
are
capable
of
carrying
burdens
of
about
a
hundred
weight
each
the
spaniards
ride
upon
them
and
when
weary
they
turn
their
heads
backward
and
void
a
wonderfully
stinking
liquor
from
their
mouths
from
the
rivers
la
plata
and
lima
or
rimac
inclusively
to
the
southwards
there
are
no
crocodiles
lizards
snakes
or
other
venomous
reptiles
but
the
rivers
produce
great
store
of
excellent
fish
on
the
coast
of
st
michael
on
the
south
sea
there
are
many
rocks
of
salt
covered
with
eggs
at
the
point
of
st
helena
there
are
springs
from
which
a
liquor
flows
that
serves
instead
of
pitch
and
tar
it
is
said
that
there
is
a
fountain
in
chili
which
converts
wood
into
stone
in
the
haven
of
truxillo
there
is
a
lake
of
fresh
water
the
bottom
of
which
is
good
hard
salt
and
in
the
andes
beyond
xauxa
there
is
a
fresh
water
river
which
flows
over
a
bottom
of
white
salt
it
is
also
affirmed
that
there
formerly
dwelt
giants
in
peru
of
whom
statues
were
found
at
porto
vejo
and
that
their
jaw
bones
were
found
in
the
haven
of
truxillo
having
teeth
three
or
four
fingers
long
in
the
year
the
viceroy
don
antonio
de
mendoça
sent
ferdinando
alorchon
with
two
ships
to
explore
the
bottom
of
the
gulph
of
california
and
divers
other
countries
in
the
same
year
gonsalvo
pizarro
went
from
quito
to
discover
the
country
of
which
there
ran
a
great
fame
in
peru
taking
with
him
a
force
of
spaniards
partly
horse
and
part
foot
with
indians
to
carry
the
baggage
he
marched
to
the
most
distant
place
or
frontier
of
the
empire
of
the
incas
in
which
place
there
happened
a
great
earthquake
accompanied
with
much
rain
and
dreadful
lightning
by
which
seventy
houses
were
swallowed
up
from
that
place
they
passed
over
a
chain
of
cold
and
snowy
mountains
where
they
found
many
indians
frozen
to
death
and
they
wondered
much
at
finding
so
much
snow
immediately
under
the
equinoctial
line
from
thence
they
proceeded
to
a
province
called
where
they
were
detained
two
months
on
account
of
constant
rain
and
beyond
this
they
came
to
the
cinnamon
trees
which
are
of
great
size
with
leaves
resembling
those
of
the
bay
tree
the
leaves
branches
roots
and
every
part
of
this
tree
tasted
like
cinnamon
but
this
taste
and
flavour
was
particularly
strong
in
the
root
yet
that
was
still
stronger
in
certain
knobs
like
or
acorns
which
were
good
merchandize
this
appears
to
have
been
of
the
same
nature
with
wild
cinnamon
of
which
there
is
great
abundance
in
the
east
indies
particularly
in
the
island
of
or
java
from
this
cinnamon
country
they
proceeded
onwards
to
the
province
and
city
of
coca
where
they
halted
for
fifty
days
after
which
they
travelled
for
sixty
leagues
along
a
river
without
being
able
to
find
any
bridge
or
ford
at
which
they
could
pass
over
in
one
place
they
found
this
river
to
form
a
cataract
of
fathoms
in
perpendicular
fall
making
such
a
noise
as
was
almost
sufficient
to
deafen
any
person
who
stood
near
not
far
beyond
this
fall
the
river
was
found
to
glide
in
a
smooth
channel
worn
out
of
the
rock
and
at
this
place
they
constructed
a
bridge
by
which
they
passed
to
the
other
side
and
entered
into
a
country
called
guema
which
was
so
poor
that
they
could
only
get
fruit
and
herbs
to
subsist
upon
travelling
onwards
from
that
place
they
came
to
a
district
where
the
people
had
some
degree
of
civilization
and
wore
cotton
clothing
of
their
own
manufacture
and
used
canoes
they
here
built
a
brigantine
in
which
and
in
some
canoes
procured
or
taken
from
the
natives
they
embarked
their
sick
with
their
treasure
provisions
and
spare
apparel
under
the
charge
of
francis
de
orellana
while
gonsalvo
pizarro
marched
by
land
with
the
rest
of
the
people
along
the
river
going
every
night
into
the
boats
in
this
manner
they
proceeded
for
about
leagues
when
one
night
on
coming
to
the
river
side
in
hopes
of
joining
the
boats
as
usual
pizarro
could
not
see
or
hear
of
them
he
and
his
people
were
reduced
by
this
unfortunate
incident
to
a
state
of
almost
utter
despair
in
a
strange
poor
and
barren
country
without
provisions
clothing
or
any
other
convenience
and
at
a
vast
distance
from
their
friends
with
a
prodigious
extent
of
difficult
and
dangerous
road
interposed
between
them
and
quito
they
were
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
eating
their
horses
and
even
their
dogs
yet
holding
a
good
heart
they
proceeded
onwards
in
their
journey
for
eighteen
months
penetrating
as
is
said
almost
leagues
without
ever
seeing
the
sun
or
any
thing
else
to
comfort
them
at
length
of
the
men
who
had
set
out
from
quito
only
ten
returned
thither
and
these
so
weak
ragged
and
disfigured
that
they
could
not
be
recognized
orellana
went
or
leagues
down
the
river
passing
through
various
countries
and
nations
on
both
sides
among
whom
he
affirmed
that
some
were
amazons
from
the
mouth
of
that
river
orellana
went
home
to
spain
and
excused
himself
for
having
deserted
pizarro
and
those
who
marched
by
land
by
alleging
that
he
had
been
forced
down
the
river
by
the
strength
of
the
current
which
he
was
utterly
unable
to
stem
by
some
this
river
is
named
after
orellana
who
first
navigated
its
waters
and
others
call
it
the
river
of
the
amazons
on
account
of
a
female
nation
of
warriors
who
are
said
to
inhabit
its
banks
in
the
year
don
stephen
de
gama
the
portuguese
governor
of
india
went
with
a
squadron
into
the
red
sea
by
the
strait
of
mecca
or
of
babelmandel
and
came
to
anchor
off
the
island
of
maçua
or
massoua
from
whence
he
sailed
along
the
coast
of
abyssinia
or
ethiopia
to
the
island
of
suachem
in
lat
and
to
the
harbour
of
cossier
in
from
thence
he
crossed
over
to
the
arabian
shore
and
the
city
of
toro
and
sailed
from
that
place
to
suez
at
the
farther
end
of
the
red
sea
and
returned
from
thence
to
india
having
extended
the
portuguese
knowledge
of
that
sea
farther
than
had
ever
been
done
before
on
the
way
between
cossier
and
toro
gama
is
said
to
have
found
an
island
of
brimstone
which
had
been
dispeopled
by
mahomet
wherein
many
crabs
are
bred
which
increase
nature
on
which
account
they
are
much
sought
after
by
the
unchaste
it
is
true
that
lopez
suarez
when
governor
of
india
had
navigated
the
red
sea
as
far
as
judda
the
haven
of
mecca
in
lat
leagues
from
the
straits
of
babelmandel
but
gama
penetrated
to
the
very
northern
extremity
of
the
gulph
in
the
same
year
diego
de
almagro
killed
the
marquis
francis
pizarro
and
his
brother
francis
martinez
de
alcantara
in
the
city
of
lima
or
los
and
usurped
the
government
of
peru
in
the
same
year
don
antony
de
mendça
viceroy
of
mexico
sent
an
army
of
spaniards
and
indians
from
mexico
under
the
command
of
francis
vasquez
de
coronado
by
way
of
culiacan
into
the
province
of
sibola
or
cinaloa
which
is
in
lat
coronado
endeavoured
to
treat
on
friendly
terms
with
the
natives
and
requested
to
be
furnished
with
provisions
but
received
for
answer
that
they
were
not
accustomed
to
give
any
thing
to
those
who
came
unto
their
country
in
a
warlike
manner
upon
this
the
spaniards
assaulted
and
took
the
town
to
which
they
gave
the
name
of
new
granada
because
the
general
was
a
native
of
granada
in
old
spain
the
soldiers
found
themselves
much
deceived
by
the
reports
of
the
friars
who
had
been
in
those
parts
as
already
mentioned
under
the
year
who
said
that
the
country
was
rich
in
gold
silver
and
precious
stones
not
being
willing
therefore
to
return
to
mexico
they
went
to
the
town
of
where
they
heard
of
and
the
king
of
which
was
reported
to
worship
a
golden
cross
and
the
picture
of
the
queen
of
heaven
or
the
blessed
virgin
in
this
journey
the
spaniards
endured
many
hardships
but
the
indians
fled
every
where
before
them
and
one
morning
they
found
thirty
of
their
horses
had
died
during
the
night
from
they
went
to
a
distance
of
leagues
in
their
estimation
the
whole
way
being
in
a
level
country
and
they
marked
their
route
by
means
of
small
hillocks
of
cow
dung
that
they
might
be
the
better
able
to
find
their
way
back
at
one
time
they
had
a
storm
of
hail
the
hailstones
being
as
large
as
oranges
at
length
they
reached
quivira
where
they
found
the
king
whose
only
riches
consisted
in
a
copper
ornament
which
he
wore
suspended
from
his
neck
they
saw
neither
cross
nor
image
of
the
virgin
nor
any
indication
whatever
of
the
christian
religion
this
country
according
to
their
report
was
very
thinly
inhabited
more
especially
in
its
champaign
or
level
parts
in
which
the
whole
people
wandered
about
with
their
cattle
of
which
they
have
great
abundance
living
much
in
the
same
manner
with
the
arabs
in
barbary
removing
from
place
to
place
according
to
the
seasons
in
search
of
pastures
for
their
cattle
the
cattle
belonging
to
these
indians
are
almost
as
large
as
horses
having
large
horns
and
bear
fleeces
of
wool
like
sheep
on
which
account
the
spaniards
gave
them
that
name
they
have
abundance
of
another
kind
of
oxen
or
cattle
very
monstrous
in
their
form
having
hunches
on
their
backs
like
camels
with
long
beards
and
long
manes
like
horses
the
indians
live
by
eating
these
oxen
and
by
drinking
their
blood
and
clothe
themselves
in
their
skins
most
of
their
food
is
raw
or
at
least
slightly
roasted
as
they
have
no
pots
in
which
to
boil
their
food
they
cut
their
meat
with
certain
knives
made
of
flint
their
fruits
are
damsons
melons
grapes
pines
and
mulberries
they
have
dogs
of
such
vast
strength
that
one
of
them
will
hold
a
bull
be
he
never
so
wild
when
the
indians
remove
from
place
to
place
these
dogs
carry
their
wives
children
and
household
stuff
on
their
backs
and
are
so
strong
as
to
carry
fifty
pounds
at
once
i
omit
many
other
circumstances
of
this
expedition
because
the
plan
i
have
prescribed
requires
brevity
in
the
year
when
diego
de
frietas
was
in
the
port
of
dodra
in
the
kingdom
of
siam
three
portuguese
of
his
crew
deserted
and
went
in
a
junk
towards
china
the
names
of
these
men
were
antonio
de
mota
francis
zeimoro
and
antonio
pexoto
who
directed
their
course
for
the
city
of
liampa
in
lat
or
upwards
having
encountered
a
great
storm
they
were
driven
to
a
distance
from
land
distance
from
land
and
came
in
sight
of
an
island
far
to
the
east
in
lat
which
they
called
japan
and
which
seems
to
be
the
isle
of
zipangri
mentioned
by
marco
polo
the
venetian
which
in
exceedingly
rich
in
gold
and
silver
and
other
valuable
commodities
in
the
same
year
don
antonio
de
mendoça
the
viceroy
of
new
spain
sent
certain
sea
captains
and
pilots
to
explore
the
coast
of
cape
del
engannon
where
a
fleet
sent
by
cortes
had
been
before
they
sailed
as
far
as
the
latitude
when
they
came
in
sight
of
a
range
of
mountains
covered
in
snow
which
they
name
or
the
snowy
mountains
in
lat
they
here
met
with
certain
merchant
ships
which
carried
on
their
stems
the
images
of
a
kind
of
birds
called
and
had
their
yards
gilded
and
their
bows
laid
over
with
silver
these
seemed
to
belong
to
the
islands
of
japan
or
to
china
as
the
people
said
that
their
country
was
within
thirty
days
sail
in
the
same
year
the
viceroy
mendoça
sent
a
fleet
of
six
ships
with
spanish
soldiers
and
as
many
mexicans
under
the
command
of
his
rui
lopez
de
villa
lobos
a
person
in
high
estimation
to
the
mindanao
islands
they
sailed
on
the
eve
of
all
saints
from
the
harbour
of
natividad
in
lat
and
shaping
their
course
towards
the
west
they
came
in
sight
of
the
island
of
st
thomas
which
had
been
before
discovered
by
hernando
de
girijalva
and
beyond
that
in
they
got
sight
of
another
island
which
they
named
or
the
cloudy
island
and
from
thence
they
came
to
another
island
which
they
named
or
the
cloven
rock
on
the
of
december
they
discovered
certain
shoals
having
only
six
or
seven
fathoms
water
on
the
fifteenth
of
the
same
month

which
were

by

gomez
de
sequieira
and
alvaro
de
saavedra
called
or
islands
of
the
kings
because
discovered
on
twelfth
day
and
beyond
these
they
found
a
cluster
of
islands
in
of
latitude
and
came
to
an
anchor
in
the
midst
of
them
where
they
took
in
wood
and
water
in
january
leaving
these
islands
they
came
in
sight
of
certain
other
islands
from
which
the
natives
came
off
to
them
in
a
kind
of
boats
bearing
crosses
in
their
hands
and
they
saluted
the
mariners
in
the
spanish
language
saying
dias
or
good
day
companions
the
spaniards
were
much
surprised
at
being
thus
accosted
in
their
own
language
and
seeing
such
indications
of
christianity
at
no
great
a
distance
from
spain
not
knowing
that
many
of
the
natives
in
these
parts
had
been
baptised
by
francis
de
castro
at
the
command
of
me
antonio
galvano
an
formerly
mentioned
from
these
for
circumstances
some
of
the
spaniards
named
these
islands
de
los
or
the
islands
of
crosses
and
others
called
them
de
los
or
the
islands
of
companions
on
the
first
of
february
ruy
lopez
came
in
sight
of
the
noble
island
of
mindanao
in
but
he
could
neither
double
that
inland
owing
to
contrary
winds
nor
would
the
natives
permit
him
to
come
to
anchor
on
their
coast
because
the
five
or
six
christened
kings
and
their
people
had
promised
obedience
to
me
antonio
galvano
and
were
unwilling
to
incur
my
displeasure
on
this
account
and
constrained
by
contrary
winds
lopez
sailed
along
the
coast
in
quest
of
a
place
of
safety
and
in
four
or
five
degrees
of
latitude
he
found
a
small
island
called
sarangam
by
the
natives
which
he
took
possession
of
by
force
and
named
it
antonio
after
the
viceroy
of
mexico
ruy
lopez
and
his
people
remained
here
a
whole
year
during
which
many
things
occurred
worth
notice
but
as
these
are
treated
of
in
other
histories
i
refrain
from
mentioning
them
confining
myself
entirely
to
discoveries
in
the
month
of
august
of
the
same
year
ruy
lopez
sent
bartholomew
de
la
torre
in
a
small
ship
to
new
spain
to
acquaint
the
viceroy
of
his
proceedings
torre
went
first
to
the
islands
named
gaonala
and
many
others
in
and
lat
where
magellan
and
de
castro
had
both
been
formerly
and
where
the
latter
baptized
many
of
the
natives
and
the
spaniards
called
these
the
in
honour
of
the
prince
of
spain
in
these
islands
torre
procured
provisions
and
wood
and
water
whence
he
sailed
for
several
days
with
a
fair
wind
edging
towards
the
till
he
came
right
under
the
tropic
of
cancer
on
the
of
september
they
came
in
sight
of
certain
islands
which
they
named
or
the
evil
roads
beyond
which
they
discovered
dos
or
the
two
sisters
and
beyond
these
again
four
islands
which
they
called
on
the
second
of
october
they
came
in
sight
of
beyond
which
there
is
a
high
pointed
rock
which
throws
up
fire
in
five
places
sailing
in
this
manner
for
some
time
in
of
north
latitude
they
were
obliged
by
continual
contrary
winds
to
bear
up
again
for
the
philippine
islands
and
in
their
way
back
had
sight
of
six
or
seven
additional
islands
but
did
not
anchor
at
any
of
them
they
found
also
an
archipelago
or
numerous
cluster
of
islands
in
or
degrees
of
north
latitude
well
inhabited
by
a
white
people
with
beautiful
women
and
much
better
clothed
than
in
any
other
of
the
islands
of
these
parts
and
they
had
many
golden
ornaments
which
was
a
sure
sign
that
there
was
some
of
that
metal
in
their
country
these
people
likewise
had
barks
or
vessels
of
cubits
long
by
two
fathoms
and
a
half
in
breadth
constructed
of
planks
five
inches
broad
and
which
were
rowed
with
oars
the
people
told
the
spaniards
that
they
were
in
use
to
sail
in
these
vessels
to
china
which
was
not
above
five
or
six
days
sail
from
thence
and
offered
to
supply
them
with
pilots
if
they
were
inclined
to
go
thither
several
of
these
barks
handsomely
decked
came
off
to
the
spanish
ship
in
which
the
master
and
other
principal
people
sat
on
a
high
platform
while
the
rowers
sat
underneath
who
were
or
negroes
with
frizzled
hair
being
asked
whence
they
had
these
negroes
they
answered
that
they
were
brought
from
certain
islands
near
sebut
where
there
were
abundance
to
be
had
the
spaniards
wondered
much
at
finding
negroes
in
this
place
being
above
leagues
from
the
nearest
land
of
the
negroes
it
is
therefore
probable
that
these
people
were
not
originally
natives
of
this
part
of
the
world
but
that
they
have
been
scattered
somehow
in
various
places
over
the
circuit
of
the
earth
as
they
are
found
in
the
islands
of
nicobar
and
andaman
in
the
bay
of
bengal
from
thence
for
the
space
of
leagues
we
do
not
know
of
any
other
black
people
yet
vasco
nunnez
de
valboa
pretends
to
have
discovered
them
when
he
went
to
explore
the
coast
of
the
south
sea
in
a
country
which
he
named
but
there
never
were
any
found
in
new
spain
castilia
del
oro
or
in
peru
in
the
year
don
gutierre
de
vargas
bishop
of
placenza
the
cousin
of
mendoça
sent
a
fleet
from
seville
to
the
straits
of
magellan
instigated
by
the
advice
of
the
viceroy
some
said
that
this
fleet
was
destined
for
the
moluccas
others
for
china
and
others
again
that
it
was
meant
only
to
explore
the
coast
from
the
straits
along
chili
to
peru
however
this
may
have
been
the
fleet
was
unable
from
contrary
winds
to
get
through
the
straits
except
one
small
bark
which
got
into
the
south
sea
and
sailed
along
the
whole
coast
till
it
came
to
and
which
is
above
leagues
which
were
now
explored
all
the
rest
of
the
coast
having
been
formerly
discovered
by
diego
de
almagro
francis
pizarro
and
their
people
at
various
times
in

of
the
year
ruy
lopez
de
villa
lobos
formerly
mentioned
came
with
his
spaniards
to
the
isle
of
and
the
city
of
where
he
was
well
received
by
the
kings
of
gilolo
and
tidore
and
the
people
of
the
country
for
i
antonio
galvano
had
then
left
the
moluccas
and
they
put
the
governor
don
george
de
castro
to
much
trouble
and
great
expence
in
the
same
year
ruy
lopez
de
villa
lobos
sent
another
ship
from
tidore
for
new
spain
under
the
command
of
ignatius
ortez
de
rotha
and
having
jaspar
rico
as
pilot
with
orders
to
attempt
the
passage
by
the
south
side
of
the
line
ortez
sailed
to
the
coast
of
papua
which
he
explored
and
as
he
knew
not
that
saavedra
had
been
there
formerly
he
challenged
the
credit
and
honour
of
the
discovery
finding
the
natives
of
a
black
colour
with
frizzled
hair
he
named
the
country
on
that
account
new
guinea
thus
the
memory
of
saavedra
was
then
almost
lost
as
every
thing
is
apt
to
fall
into
oblivion
unless
put
upon
record
and
illustrated
by
writing
in
june
of
this
year
one
pedro
fidalgo
a
portuguese
sailed
in
a
junk
from
the
city
of
borneo
but
being
driven
to
the
north
by
contrary
winds
he
fell
in
with
a
large
island
the
south
extremity
of
which
lay
in
nine
or
ten
degrees
of
north
latitude
while
it
stretched
to
lat
at
its
other
end
which
is
called
the
island
of
luçones
from
the
name
of
the
nation
by
which
it
is
inhabited
perhaps
it
may
have
some
other
name
of
which
as
yet
we
have
not
been
informed
this
island
runs
from
the
north
for
a
great
way
directly
south
and
then
takes
a
turn
towards
the
it
is
said
that
fidalgo
sailed
for
leagues
along
the
coast
of
this
island
which
is
in
the
mindanao
and
china
and
he
reported
that
the
land
was
fruitful
and
well
clothed
with
trees
and
verdure
and
that
the
inhabitants
will
give
two
pezoes
of
gold
for
one
of
silver
although
so
near
china
in
which
the
relative
value
of
these
metals
is
so
well
understood
in
the
year
certain
ships
were
sent
out
from
england
which
sailed
to
the
northward
along
the
coast
of
norway
and
finmark
and
from
thence
east
in
seventy
or
eighty
degrees
of
north
latitude
till
they
came
to
muscovy
to
which
country
one
of
the
ships
penetrated
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
learn
what
became
of
the
rest
from
the
land
of
muscovy
a
ship
may
sail
eastwards
to
tartary
at
the
farthest
extremity
of
which
china
is
situated
it
is
reported
that
there
is
a
wall
above
leagues
in
length
between
tartary
and
china
in
about
lat
from
all
the
preceding
discoveries
it
may
be
concluded
that
as
the
whole
earth
is
degrees
and
the
ancient
writers
allow
leagues
for
every
degree
the
entire
circuit
of
the
earth
would
thus
be
leagues
but
as
in
my
opinion
each
degree
is
exactly
seventeen
leagues
the
circuit
will
then
be
only
leagues
however
this
may
be
the
whole
circuit
of
the
globe
has
been
discovered
and
sailed
over
from
east
to
west
even
almost
as
it
is
encompassed
and
visited
by
the
sun
in
its
diurnal
course
it
is
quite
otherwise
however
in
respect
to
the
northern
and
southern
parts
of
the
earth
for
towards
the
north
pole
there
has
only
been
discovered
hitherto
to
the
latitude
of
or
which
make
an
extent
of
leagues
and
between
the
equinoctial
and
the
south
pole
there
has
only
been
discovered
to
the
latitude
of
or
south
or
to
the
straits
of
magellan
which
amounts
to
no
more
than
leagues
now
adding
these
two
together
their
sum
is
just
leagues
and
deducting
this
sum
from
leagues
there
still
remains
to
be
discovered
in
the
north
and
south
leagues

it
is
certainly
possible
that

may
have
used
that
mode
in
his
course
to
the
canaries

as
his
run
across
the

was
nearly
on

he
must
have
kept

in

the

being
altogether
neglected
in

by

it
is
impossible
to
form
any
conjecture
as
to
the
islands
indicated
in

they
may
possibly
have
belonged
to
the
carolines
of
modern

which
extend
between

about

of

the
account
which
galvano
gives
of
this
voyage
is
very
vague
and
inconclusive
we
shall
find
afterwards
that
the
spaniards
found
out
the
means
of
counteracting
the
perpetual
eastern
trade
winds
of
the
pacific
within
the
tropics
by
shaping
a
more
northerly
course
from
the
philippine
islands
where
they
established
the
staple
of
their
indian
commerce
between
acapulco
and
e
galvano
certainly
mistakes
here
in
assigning
tecoantepec
which
is
at
least
miles
from
the
nearest
part
of
the
bay
of
honduras
if
a
navigation
were
practicable
from
tecoantepec
it
would
more
probably
be
towards
tabasco
at
the
bottom
of
the
bay
of
campechy
perhaps
he
ought
to
have
said
from
guatimala
to
the
gulf
of
dolse
at
the
bottom
of
the
bay
of
honduras
this
splendid
navigation
between
the
atlantic
and
pacific
within
the
tropics
like
that
between
the
mediterranean
and

still
remains
an
unsolved
problem
it
will
be
resumed
hereafter
among

all
to

the

truly
absurd
if

in

usually
goes
under
the
name
of
whose
name
appears
on
the
title
somewhat
equivocally
as
the
author
but
who
is
mentioned
in
the
advertisement
as
a
writer
belonging
to
the
middle
of
the
preceding
century
and
the
only
part
of
the
work
that
can
be
attributed
to
him

a
of
navigation
and
of
the
modern

of

those
made
by

of

gives
no
account
of
himself
or
of
the
sources
from
whence
he
has
derived
his
different
articles
and
only
says
that

might
have
been
more
aptly
placed
towards
the
close

of

but
escaped
notice
in

time
and
it
appears
of
too
much
importance

in
itself

early
document
to
be
omitted

punctilious
attention

rigid
systematic

preface
of

the
illustrious
republic
of

having
done
me
the
honour
to
appoint
me
ambassador
to

i
accepted
the
employment
with
much
pleasure
both
that
i
might
do
acceptable
service
to
my
own
country
and
for
the
general
good
of
christendom
i
neither
considered
the
difficulties
nor
the
dangers
of
the
journey
but
placed
my
trust
solely
on
the
assistance
of
god
preferring
the
interests
of
my
country
and
of
the
christian
world
to
my
own
ease
and
safety
on
purpose
to
render
my
discoveries
useful
to
the
public
i
have
carefully
and
briefly
recorded
every
circumstance
deserving

attention
that
occurred
during
my
long
and
laborious
journey
as
relative
to
the
provinces

and
places
through
which
i
travelled

the
manners
and
customs
of
the
different

among
whom
i
sojourned
in

i
have
omitted
nothing
deserving

that
occurred

together
with

all
of
us
disguised
in
ordinary
german
dresses
our
money
being
concealed
in
the
clothes
of
stephen
testa
we
went
by
water
in
the
first
place
to
the
church
of
michael
in
where
we
heard
mass
and
received
the
benediction
of
the
prior
after
which
we
mounted
our
horses
which
were
there
in
waiting
and
reached
treviso
the
same
day
i
anxiously
wished
to
have
procured
some
person
to
accompany
us
on
the
journey
who
knew
the
road
but
could
not
meet
with
any
nor
could
i
even
procure
a
guide
for
hire
leaving
treviso
on
the
we
arrived
that
day
at
cogiensi
now
called
cornegliano
and
knowing
the
dangers
and
difficulties
we
must
experience
during
our
long
journey
we
here
confessed
and
partook
of
the
holy
sacrament
of
the
eucharist
after
which
we
resumed
our
journey
we
fortunately
overtook
a
german
named
sebastian
who
said
he
knew
me
and
the
object
of
my
journey
and
offered
to
keep
us
company
to
nuremburgh
i
gladly
accepted
of
this
person
as
a
companion
of
our
journey
inwardly
thanking
god
for
affording
us
a
guide
we
continued
our
journey
to
the
frontiers
of
germany
passing
through
several
cities
and
castles
belonging
to
different
princes
and
bishops
vassals
of
the
empire
among
which
the
city
of
augsburg
seemed
one
of
the
most
beautiful
not
far
from
that
place
our
german
companion
sebastian
left
us
taking
the
road
for
francfort
we
parted
from
him
with
many
embraces
giving
him
thanks
for
his
numerous
attentions
and
mutually
wishing
each
other
a
good
journey
having
procured
a
new
guide
we
arrived
at
nuremburg
on
the
of
march
this
is
a
fine
city
having
a
river
running
through
the
middle
of
it
and
is
defended
by
an
excellent
citadel
while
here
i
inquired
of
my
landlord
if
there
were
any
travellers
going
our
way
he
informed
me
that
there
were
two
ambassadors
from
the
king
of
poland
then
in
the
city
who
he
was
certain
would
be
happy
to
receive
a
visit
from
me
i
therefore
sent
my
chaplain
stephen
testa
to
inform
these
gentlemen
of
my
being
in
nuremburg
and
of
the
purpose
of
my
journey
and
of
my
desire
to
pay
them
a
visit
they
received
my
message
with
much
civility
and
i
accordingly
went
to
wait
upon
them
these
gentlemen
were
counsellors
of
state
to
his
polish
majesty
one
of
whom
was
an
archbishop
and
the
other
a
knight
named
paul
after
mutual
compliments
i
informed
them
that
i
proposed
paying
my
respects
to
their
sovereign
and
was
furnished
with
a
passport
notwithstanding
the
sorry
equipage
in
which
i
travelled
they
received
me
with
much
honour
i
remained
four
days
in
nuremburg
during
which
i
formed
a
friendly
intimacy
with
the
polish
ambassadors
and
then
resumed
my
journey
in
their
company
being
likewise
accompanied
by
an
ambassador
belonging
to
the
king
of
bohemia
eldest
son
of
the
king
of
poland
departing
from
nuremburg
on
the
of
march
now
nearly
sixty
horsemen
in
company
we
crossed
through
germany
always
lodging
in
good
cities
or
castles
some
of
which
were
extremely
beautiful
both
in
respect
to
their
situation
and
the
excellence
of
their
fortifications
but
i
omit
describing
them
as
they
are
well
known
to
travellers
the
journey
across
germany
took
us
twelve
days
during
which
we
passed
through
the
greater
part
of
the
dominions
of
the
maregrave
of
brandenburg
and
arrived
at
the
imperial
city
of
francfort
a
tolerably
good
and
well
fortified
city
on
the
oder
we
rested
here
till
the
of
march
as
this
city
is
near
the
confines
of
poland
we
had
an
escort
of
cavalry
belonging
to
the
maregrave
of
brandenburg
which
accompanied
us
to
the
frontiers
these
soldiers
were
well
mounted
and
armed
and
marched
in
good
order
on
the
last
day
of
march
we
arrived
at
miedzyrzyez
which
is
a
small
city
but
strong
and
pleasant
and
is
the
first
place
on
the
frontiers
of
poland
from
that
place
till
we
reached
or
poznan
which
took
us
three
days
journey
we
saw
no
place
worth
notice
poznan
is
particularly
remarkable
on
account
of
a
great
fair
which
is
resorted
to
by
many
merchants
leaving
poznan
on
the
of
april
we
arrived
on
the
at
lenczycz
where
casimir
king
of
poland
then
resided
in
this
journey
we
found
neither
cities
nor
considerable
castles
and
had
much
reason
to
remember
germany
with
regret
both
on
account
of
bad
lodgings
and
every
other
circumstance
when
my
arrival
was
announced
to
the
king
he
sent
two
of
his
gentlemen
to
wait
upon
me
who
assigned
me
a
tolerably
commodious
lodging
next
day
being
easter
when
no
business
of
any
kind
is
transacted
i
rested
after
the
fatigues
of
the
journey
on
the
following
morning
the
king
sent
me
a
robe
of
black
damask
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
that
i
might
go
to
court
which
i
did
accompanied
by
several
persons
of
distinction
and
had
the
honour
to
pay
my
respects
to
the
king
according
to
the
ceremonies
of
that
court
after
which
i
presented
the
letters
of
our
illustrious
republic
to
his
majesty
and
explained
to
him
the
nature
of
my
commission
the
king
was
pleased
to
invite
me
to
dinner
which
was
served
much
in
the
same
manner
as
with
us
the
dishes
being
in
great
abundance
and
well
dressed
as
soon
as
dinner
was
over
i
asked
permission
to
retire
which
was
accordingly
granted
two
days
afterwards
i
was
again
sent
for
to
court
when
the
king
gave
orderly
answers
to
all
the
proposals
which
i
had
made
in
the
name
of
our
republic
and
with
so
much
benevolent
attention
towards
me
that
i
learned
by
experience
that
he
justly
deserved
the
character
of
the
best
king
who
had
reigned
in
poland
for
a
great
many
years
he
was
pleased
to
appoint
me
two
guides
one
of
whom
was
to
accompany
me
through
poland
and
the
other
through
lower
russia
to
kiow
or
magrano
which
is
the
key
of
the
kingdom
i
humbly
thanked
his
majesty
in
the
name
of
the
republic
and
took
my
leave
i
left
lenczycz
on
the
of
april
on
my
journey
through
poland
which
is
a
flat
country
ornamented
with
many
forests
but
the
great
want
of
convenient
lodgings
is
a
sure
proof
that
it
is
not
very
fertile
nor
much
abounding
in
the
necessaries
of
life
on
the
i
arrived
at
lublin
a
tolerable
city
defended
by
a
citadel
the
three
sons
of
the
king
resided
there
at
this
time
for
their
education
the
eldest
of
these
princes
was
about
fourteen
years
of
age
and
the
two
others
considerably
younger
learning
that
they
wished
to
see
me
providing
that
their
father
had
not
forbidden
i
waited
upon
them
and
was
received
with
much
politeness
the
eldest
conversing
with
me
in
the
most
obliging
manner
and
i
observed
that
they
behaved
with
much
respect
to
their
preceptor
i
took
my
leave
of
them
returning
thanks
for
their
civilities
and
they
parted
from
me
with
as
much
courtesy
as
i
had
experienced
in
my
reception
leaving
lublin
and
continuing
our
journey
through
poland
we
arrived
on
the
of
april
in
lower
russia
which
is
subject
to
the
king
of
poland
in
this
part
of
our
journey
we
travelled
five
whole
days
through
thick
woods
and
except
meeting
with
a
very
few
castles
we
lodged
for
the
most
part
in
country
houses
on
the
we
came
to
a
town
named
which
is
defended
by
a
wooden
castle
we
rested
here
for
some
time
yet
not
without
danger
as
the
inhabitants
were
quite
mad
with
drunkenness
on
account
of
celebrating
certain
marriages
this
country
produces
no
wine
but
the
natives
prepare
a
liquor
from
honey
which
is
stronger
and
more
intoxicating
even
than
wine
leaving
this
place
we
came
to
another
village
named
in
which
likewise
there
is
a
wooden
castle
during
the
whole
of
our
journey
of
the
we
travelled
through
forests
in
constant
danger
of
robbers
who
infested
all
the
roads
and
we
knew
not
where
to
pass
the
night
or
to
procure
any
refreshments
insomuch
that
we
had
to
sleep
in
the
woods
keeping
strict
watch
lest
we
might
be
surprised
by
the
banditti
on
the
of
april
we
reached
which
signifies
the
fort
where
we
were
lodged
in
the
royal
palace
and
passed
the
night
with
much
inconvenience
on
the
first
of
may
we
reached
the
city
of
or
magraman
the
governor
of
this
city
which
stands
beyond
the
frontiers
of
polish
russia
was
a
polander
and
catholic
named
immediately
on
learning
my
arrival
from
the
guides
sent
along
with
me
by
the
king
he
appointed
me
a
lodging
which
was
sufficiently
small
considering
the
size
of
the
city
he
here
visited
me
and
sent
me
a
sufficient
supply
of
provisions
this
city
serves
as
a
barrier
or
frontier
garrison
against
the
tartars
and
is
celebrated
for
a
great
fair
to
which
the
merchants
bring
rich
furs
and
other
goods
from
upper
russia
from
hence
the
merchants
travel
in
a
large
caravan
to
caffa
or
theodosia
in
the
crimea
but
are
often
surprised
and
very
ill
treated
by
the
tartars
during
their
journey
the
country
about
kiow
abounds
in
grain
and
cattle
the
inhabitants
of
this
place
occupy
the
whole
day
in
their
affairs
till
three
employing
all
the
rest
till
night
in
drinking
and
quarrels
the
natural
consequence
of
drunkenness
on
the
day
of
my
arrival
governor
pamartin
sent
some
of
his
gentlemen
to
invite
me
to
dinner
which
i
accepted
with
as
much
politeness
as
i
could
express
he
received
me
very
honourably
offering
me
every
service
in
his
power
in
the
most
obliging
manner
saying
that
he
was
ordered
by
the
king
of
poland
to
treat
me
in
every
thing
as
well
as
possible
on
which
i
thanked
him
for
his
polite
attentions
and
endeavoured
to
recommend
myself
to
his
friendship
from
him
i
was
informed
that
he
was
in
daily
expectation
of
the
arrival
of
an
ambassador
from
lithuania
going
with
presents
to
the
prince
of
the
tartars
who
was
to
have
an
escort
of
tartar
horse
and
if
i
were
inclined
to
take
advantage
of
this
opportunity
by
which
means
i
should
travel
in
much
greater
safety
i
had
better
wait
the
arrival
of
this
ambassador
i
accepted
of
this
offer
most
willingly
and
we
then
sat
down
to
a
magnificent
entertainment
at
which
the
bishop
of
kiow
who
was
brother
to
the
governor
and
many
other
persons
of
consequence
were
present
we
wanted
nothing
which
could
contribute
to
make
the
dinner
pleasant
good
company
good
cheer
and
music
during
the
repast
the
only
circumstance
i
did
not
like
was
that
it
lasted
too
long
as
i
had
more
need
for
sleep
and
rest
after
my
fatiguing
journey
than
of
all
the
good
cheer
that
could
be
offered
in
consequence
as
soon
as
dinner
was
ended
i
took
my
leave
and
retired
to
my
lodgings
in
the
city
the
governor
living
in
the
castle
which
is
only
of
wood
the
city
of
kiow
stands
on
the
river
named
anciently
boristhenes
and
danambre
by
the
natives
which
we
italians
call
lerissa
and
which
falls
into
the
euxine
on
the
of
may
the
ambassador
of
lithuania
arrived
and
as
he
was
to
set
out
next
day
after
mass
i
went
to
pay
him
my
compliments
accompanied
by
pamartin
who
directed
him
on
the
part
of
the
king
of
poland
to
take
care
of
me
and
to
conduct
me
in
perfect
safety
to
theodosia
to
this
the
ambassador
answered
that
he
had
every
respect
for
the
orders
of
his
majesty
the
sovereign
arbiter
of
his
life
and
death
and
would
carefully
obey
his
orders
i
thanked
pamartin
for
all
his
kindnesses
as
he
had
frequently
visited
me
and
had
supplied
me
with
every
thing
i
needed
for
subsistence
during
my
stay
and
as
some
token
of
my
gratitude
i
made
him
a
present
of
a
tolerably
good
german
horse
which
had
carried
me
hitherto
we
here
parted
with
the
rest
of
our
horses
which
were
quite
unfit
for
our
farther
use
and
procured
horses
of
the
country
for
the
remainder
of
our
journey
and
on
parting
with
the
guides
who
had
accompanied
us
to
kiow
by
orders
of
the
king
i
rewarded
them
for
their
attention
and
good
conduct
i
left
kiow
on
the
of
may
along
with
the
lithuanian
ambassador
and
as
i
was
unable
to
travel
on
horseback
on
account
of
pains
in
my
feet
i
travelled
in
a
carriage
which
had
served
me
for
that
purpose
ever
since
i
left
the
king
of
poland
at
lenczycz
the
first
place
we
came
to
was
belonging
to
the
king
of
poland
where
we
waited
till
the
for
the
tartar
horse
who
came
to
escort
us
on
our
journey
after
their
arrival
we
set
out
on
our
journey
through
the
great
desert
of
tartary
and
came
to
the
boristhenes
which
separates
tartary
from
russia
and
which
is
some
miles
broad
as
it
was
necessary
to
pass
the
river
our
tartars
cut
down
some
trees
the
stems
of
which
they
fastened
together
into
a
raft
which
was
covered
over
by
the
branches
and
upon
which
the
whole
of
our
baggage
was
placed
they
fastened
their
horses
by
the
tails
to
this
raft
by
which
means
it
was
dragged
across
the
river
they
themselves
swimming
of
their
horses
and
holding
by
their
manes
we
had
likewise
to
swim
our
horses
across
in
which
we
succeeded
by
the
blessing
of
god
but
in
much
fear
and
danger
at
this
to
us
unusual
mode
of
navigation
when
we
got
over
we
had
to
remain
a
whole
day
on
the
other
side
to
collect
and
replace
our
baggage
while
among
the
tartars
their
officers
eyed
me
with
much
attention
and
suspicion
and
during
our
new
journey
through
the
desert
beyond
the
river
the
lithuanian
ambassador
informed
me
by
means
of
the
interpreter
that
the
tartar
officers
had
come
to
a
resolution
to
carry
me
to
their
prince
as
they
could
not
allow
a
person
of
my
appearance
to
go
on
to
theodosia
without
his
permission
i
was
much
alarmed
by
this
intelligence
believing
that
i
should
incur
considerable
risk
of
having
the
purposes
of
my
journey
frustrated
by
this
measure
and
therefore
earnestly
recommended
to
the
ambassador
to
keep
in
mind
the
orders
he
had
received
on
the
part
of
the
king
of
poland
respecting
me
and
the
promises
he
had
made
to
pamartin
and
i
promised
to
make
a
present
of
a
sword
to
the
interpreter
if
he
succeeded
to
extricate
me
from
my
embarrassment
the
interpreter
reported
my
fears
and
wishes
to
the
ambassador
who
succeeded
after
drinking
with
the
tartars
in
persuading
them
that
i
was
of
genoa
and
by
means
of
a
present
of
fifteen
ducats
he
obtained
permission
for
me
to
go
direct
for
theodosia
our
journey
through
the
desert
continued
till
the
of
june
during
which
we
suffered
many
hardships
having
at
one
time
been
a
whole
day
and
night
without
water
at
length
it
became
necessary
for
us
to
part
company
the
lithuanian
ambassador
and
his
escort
taking
the
direct
road
to
bachiserai
at
which
place
the
prince
of
the
tartars
resided
on
this
occasion
a
tartar
was
appointed
to
be
our
guide
to
theodosia
and
we
parted
from
the
escort
not
without
considerable
apprehensions
of
some
sudden
attack
from
the
tartars
yet
much
satisfied
at
getting
rid
of
that
crew
for
they
smelt
so
abominably
from
feeding
on
horse
flesh
that
it
was
quite
intolerable
to
come
near
them
our
whole
company
passed
the
ensuing
night
in
carts
covered
with
skins
in
which
we
were
soon
surrounded
by
a
great
number
of
persons
inquiring
who
we
were
on
being
informed
by
our
tartar
guide
that
i
was
of
genoa
they
supplied
us
with
milk
and
left
us
resuming
our
journey
next
morning
early
we
arrived
that
day
which
was
the
of
june
at
the
suburbs
of
theodosia
otherwise
called
kaffa
filled
with
gratitude
for
our
preservation
through
so
many
dangers
we
went
privately
into
a
church
to
give
thanks
to
god
for
our
safe
arrival
and
from
thence
i
sent
my
interpreter
to
inform
the
venetian
consul
of
my
arrival
he
immediately
sent
his
brother
to
wait
upon
me
advising
me
to
remain
where
i
was
till
night
when
he
carried
me
privately
to
a
house
belonging
to
him
in
the
same
suburb
where
i
was
exceedingly
well
received
i
here
found
paulus
omnibamus
who
had
left
venice
three
months
before
me
under
the
orders
of
our
illustrious
republic
in
the
latter
part
of
this
journey
the
date
of
his
return
to
venice
is
the
of
e
called
tarvisin
in
the
e
called
conigiano
in
the
edition
of
e
this
small
city
stands
on
a
small
river
which
runs
into
the
werta
at
the
western
extremity
of
what
was
poland
about
miles
from
poznan
it
is
called
messaricie
in
the
e
lausicie
in
the
e
named
chio
in
the
original
the
second
name
magrano
is
afterwards
called
magraman
by
contarini
or
his
french
e
named
chio
in
the
original
but
which
must
necessarily
be
kiow
or
kieu
now
belonging
to
russia
the
three
formerly
mentioned
stages
jusch
aitomir
and
belligraoch
must
either
be
villages
of
too
little
importance
to
find
a
place
in
geographical
maps
or
their
names
are
so
corrupted
as
to
be
unintelligible
the
direct
road
from
lublin
to
kiow
passes
through
the
palatinates
of
russia
wolhynia
and
kiow
provinces
of
poland
now
annexed
to
the
russian
e
the
original
says
april
but
attention
to
the
context
distinctly
points
out
this
necessary
e
from
this
circumstance
it
evidently
appears
that
the
journey
from
kiow
had
hitherto
been
on
the
right
or
west
of
the
dnieper
or
boristhenes
through
the
country
of
the
nogais
tartars
now
forming
the
western
portion
of
the
russian
province
of
catharinoslau
and
we
may
suppose
the
wide
part
of
that
river
they
had
now
to
cross
to
have
been
somewhere
about
e
named
arcercheriher
in
the
french
translation
of
contarini
but
which
must
necessarily
be
some
corruption
of
baschiserai
the
residence
of
the
khan
of
the
crim
e
section
ii
leaving
kaffa
crosses
the
euxine
to
the
city
of
phasis
whence
he
pursues
his
journey
through
mingrelia
georgia
and
part
of
armenia
into
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
give
any
exact
description
of
the
city
of
kaffa
or
theodosia
or
of
its
government
as
the
danger
of
incurring
suspicion
obliged
me
to
remain
continually
at
home
on
which
account
i
can
only
mention
such
particulars
as
i
learned
from
others
it
is
situated
on
the
euxine
and
is
celebrated
for
a
great
fair
which
is
much
frequented
on
which
account
the
city
is
very
populous
and
is
said
to
be
very
rich
and
powerful
i
hired
a
vessel
belonging
to
anthony
valdat
which
lay
in
the
palus
meotis
to
carry
me
to
the
city
of
when
i
was
ready
to
embark
i
met
with
two
armenians
one
of
whom
had
been
on
an
embassy
to
rome
from
uzun
hassan
and
was
persuaded
by
them
to
prefer
disembarking
at
about
an
hundred
miles
from
trebisond
instead
of
phasis
alleging
that
from
tina
it
was
only
four
hours
journey
to
a
castle
named
which
depended
upon
the
king
of
persia
and
promising
to
conduct
us
to
that
place
in
safety
although
i
was
by
no
means
satisfied
with
this
advice
i
allowed
myself
to
be
guided
by
the
consul
and
his
brother
who
agreed
in
opinion
with
the
armenians
i
accordingly
left
kaffa
on
the
of
june
accompanied
by
the
consul
who
went
with
me
to
the
river
where
our
vessel
was
in
waiting
i
had
formerly
agreed
with
the
master
for
our
passage
to
phasis
at
seventy
ducats
but
on
occasion
of
the
change
in
our
destination
i
was
now
obliged
to
pay
an
hundred
being
aware
that
i
should
not
be
able
to
meet
with
any
person
to
serve
us
at
the
place
we
were
going
to
i
used
the
precaution
to
hire
nine
men
from
kaffa
to
assist
the
mariners
of
our
vessel
and
to
procure
provisions
for
us
in
our
journey
through
georgia
and
mingrelia
we
embarked
on
the
of
june
and
made
sail
across
the
euxine
direct
for
tina
but
had
hardly
got
twenty
miles
on
our
voyage
when
a
contrary
wind
sprung
up
from
the
east
observing
the
mariners
consulting
together
in
an
extraordinary
manner
i
became
curious
to
know
the
purpose
of
their
discourse
accordingly
one
bernard
the
of
our
captain
said
to
me
that
he
understood
we
proposed
going
to
tina
but
advised
me
by
no
means
to
do
so
as
a
certain
roamed
about
that
neighbourhood
with
a
band
of
cavalry
who
would
certainly
make
us
slaves
if
we
fell
into
his
hands
on
this
advice
i
changed
my
purpose
and
the
wind
becoming
more
favourable
we
made
sail
for
liasi
and
phasis
and
arrived
at
on
the
of
june
where
i
disembarked
my
horses
and
baggage
and
sent
them
from
thence
by
land
to
phasis
which
is
sixty
miles
from
that
place
is
a
castle
with
a
small
village
in
mingrelia
belonging
to
a
lord
named
to
whom
likewise
a
place
of
small
importance
on
the
coast
of
the
euxine
is
subject
the
inhabitants
of
this
country
are
very
miserable
and
the
only
productions
are
hemp
wax
and
silk
on
the
of
july
we
arrived
near
phasis
followed
by
a
vessel
filled
with
mingrelians
who
seemed
all
to
be
fools
or
drunk
quitting
the
vessel
we
went
up
the
river
in
a
boat
passing
an
island
in
the
mouth
of
the
river
where
oetes
the
father
of
medea
the
enchantress
is
said
to
have
reigned
on
this
island
we
spent
the
night
and
were
sadly
infested
by
midges
next
day
we
went
up
the
river
in
the
boat
passing
the
city
of
asso
which
stands
on
its
banks
in
the
midst
of
a
forest
i
here
found
one
nicholas
capella
of
modena
who
commanded
in
these
parts
and
a
circassian
woman
named
martha
who
had
been
the
slave
of
a
person
of
genoa
but
was
now
married
this
martha
received
me
with
much
kindness
and
with
her
i
staid
two
days
phasis
is
a
city
of
mingrelia
subject
to
prince
bendian
whose
dominions
extend
only
about
three
days
journey
in
length
the
country
is
very
mountainous
and
full
of
forests
the
inhabitants
are
so
fierce
and
savage
that
they
might
be
accounted
wild
beasts
their
principal
drink
is
beer
they
have
some
corn
and
wine
but
in
very
small
quantities
boiled
millet
being
their
ordinary
food
which
is
a
very
poor
kind
of
nourishment
they
sometimes
procure
wine
and
salted
fish
from
trebisond
and
import
salt
from
kaffa
without
which
they
could
not
exist
their
only
productions
consist
in
a
small
quantity
of
hemp
and
wax
if
they
were
industrious
they
might
procure
abundance
of
fish
which
are
very
numerous
in
their
river
they
are
christians
according
to
the
greek
ritual
to
which
they
have
added
many
gross
superstitions
i
left
phasis
on
the
of
july
accompanied
by
nicholas
capella
and
crossed
the
river
on
a
float
that
day
and
the
next
we
travelled
through
a
considerable
portion
of
mingrelia
always
among
woods
and
mountains
towards
the
evening
of
the
we
came
to
the
habitation
of
prince
bendian
whom
we
found
with
all
his
court
reclining
on
a
plain
under
the
shade
of
some
trees
i
sent
nicholas
capella
to
inform
him
of
my
quality
and
to
ask
permission
to
pay
him
my
respects
which
was
accordingly
granted
i
saluted
him
therefore
with
great
respect
as
he
sat
on
the
ground
with
his
wife
and
children
and
he
made
me
sit
down
beside
him
after
explaining
the
purpose
of
my
journey
i
requested
he
would
have
the
goodness
to
appoint
me
a
guide
he
expressed
his
satisfaction
at
my
arrival
in
his
dominions
and
granted
my
request
he
afterwards
sent
me
some
bread
a
piece
of
beef
and
the
head
of
a
sow
but
so
under
done
that
it
required
the
extreme
necessity
in
which
we
then
were
to
induce
us
to
eat
of
his
provisions
but
when
we
can
not
get
what
we
like
we
must
put
up
with
what
can
be
had
we
had
to
wait
a
whole
day
for
the
promised
guide
the
plain
in
which
we
found
prince
bendian
is
surrounded
by
very
fine
trees
resembling
box
but
much
more
lofty
the
prince
seemed
about
fifty
years
of
age
and
had
a
tolerably
handsome
countenance
but
his
manners
were
perfectly
ridiculous
on
the
of
july
we
continued
our
journey
always
among
woods
and
mountains
and
next
day
passed
the
river
which
divides
mingrelia
from
georgia
having
to
pass
the
night
in
the
open
air
and
what
was
worse
we
had
nothing
to
eat
on
the
we
arrived
at
a
small
city
named
which
is
defended
by
a
stone
fort
and
where
we
saw
a
temple
that
seemed
very
ancient
we
had
here
to
pass
a
bridge
over
a
large
river
before
reaching
the
plain
in
which
the
huts
of
plangion
king
of
georgia
are
situated
the
fort
and
city
of
cotachis
belong
to
plangion
i
waited
upon
the
commander
of
this
place
who
invited
me
to
dinner
he
was
seated
on
the
ground
on
which
i
and
those
of
my
suite
who
accompanied
me
and
some
friends
of
the
governor
all
sat
down
before
us
was
laid
a
greasy
skin
on
which
they
served
us
with
bread
radishes
some
flesh
and
other
execrable
articles
with
which
i
was
not
acquainted
they
continually
offered
me
wine
in
large
goblets
to
fill
me
drunk
according
to
their
abominable
customs
as
they
are
as
foolish
and
beastly
as
the
mingrelians
finding
that
i
would
not
join
them
in
deep
drinking
they
held
me
in
great
contempt
insomuch
that
i
found
it
extremely
difficult
to
get
leave
to
retire
and
to
continue
my
journey
but
at
length
they
brought
me
a
guide
to
conduct
me
to
the
king
of
georgia
i
left
cotachis
on
the
of
july
and
after
travelling
the
whole
day
through
woods
and
mountains
we
rested
for
the
night
in
a
meadow
at
the
foot
of
a
mountain
near
a
castle
named
in
which
king
resides
my
guide
here
left
me
on
purpose
to
inform
the
king
of
my
arrival
promising
to
return
immediately
with
another
guide
to
serve
me
during
the
rest
of
the
journey
we
had
accordingly
to
pass
the
whole
night
in
the
wood
starving
of
hunger
and
full
of
anxiety
the
guide
came
back
early
in
the
morning
accompanied
by
two
of
the
kings
secretaries
who
informed
me
that
the
king
was
gone
to
cotachis
and
had
ordered
them
to
make
an
inventory
of
all
our
baggage
and
of
every
thing
we
had
about
us
after
which
we
should
be
provided
with
a
passport
to
travel
free
from
payment
of
any
duties
through
the
whole
country
they
proceeded
accordingly
in
their
examination
and
inventory
with
the
most
rigorous
exactness
even
noting
down
the
very
shirts
we
then
wore
after
this
they
ordered
me
to
mount
my
horse
and
to
go
along
with
them
to
the
king
leaving
all
my
people
behind
i
used
my
best
endeavours
to
be
excused
from
this
but
instead
of
listening
to
me
they
loaded
me
with
insolence
and
the
only
favour
i
could
obtain
and
that
with
the
utmost
difficulty
was
permission
to
take
my
interpreter
along
with
me
we
accordingly
resumed
our
journey
without
meat
or
drink
and
arrived
much
fatigued
at
cotachis
towards
night
where
my
interpreter
and
me
were
left
all
night
to
our
repose
under
a
tree
where
indeed
they
sent
us
some
bread
and
fish
the
remainder
of
my
people
were
taken
to
a
miserable
village
where
they
were
left
in
charge
of
the
priest
and
our
mutual
anxiety
may
be
easily
guessed
next
morning
i
was
carried
before
the
king
whom
i
found
sitting
on
the
ground
in
a
hut
surrounded
by
several
of
his
nobles
after
paying
my
respects
he
asked
me
a
great
number
of
questions
and
among
the
rest
how
many
kings
there
were
in
the
world
it
came
into
my
fancy
to
answer
that
there
were
twelve
on
which
he
signified
that
i
was
right
and
that
he
was
one
of
the
number
and
that
he
was
much
surprised
that
i
should
come
into
his
dominions
without
bringing
him
a
letter
from
my
sovereign
to
this
i
answered
that
when
i
left
my
own
country
i
did
not
expect
to
travel
through
his
dominions
otherwise
my
sovereign
would
assuredly
have
given
me
letters
in
charge
for
his
majesty
and
with
this
answer
he
seemed
satisfied
he
asked
many
other
extraordinary
questions
from
which
i
conjectured
that
my
guide
had
maliciously
represented
me
as
carrying
many
valuable
things
and
it
is
probable
if
this
had
been
the
case
that
i
had
never
been
allowed
to
escape
out
of
their
hands
the
royal
secretaries
endeavoured
to
persuade
me
that
i
ought
to
make
the
king
a
present
of
any
article
that
might
strike
his
fancy
among
my
small
baggage
but
i
got
off
without
making
any
present
except
compliments
and
requesting
him
to
appoint
some
one
to
conduct
me
through
his
dominions
this
he
was
pleased
to
promise
as
likewise
to
give
me
a
free
passport
without
paying
any
duties
as
i
carried
no
merchandize
accordingly
i
took
my
leave
of
the
king
on
the
of
july
returning
to
the
tree
i
formerly
mentioned
as
my
lodging
where
the
secretary
brought
me
the
promised
passport
and
a
guide
i
then
returned
to
my
people
at
the
village
where
they
were
kept
in
my
absence
and
was
received
with
much
joy
as
the
priest
had
represented
the
king
as
the
cruellest
tyrant
in
the
world
my
people
could
not
contain
themselves
for
excess
of
joy
at
my
safe
return
and
even
the
miserable
priest
was
so
touched
at
the
scene
that
he
provided
us
with
something
to
eat
and
we
slept
there
that
night
as
well
as
we
could
next
day
being
the
of
july
we
provided
ourselves
with
some
bread
and
wine
to
comfort
ourselves
on
the
way
and
resumed
our
journey
through
thick
forests
and
terrible
mountains
which
continued
for
two
days
in
the
evening
of
the
we
stopt
near
a
spring
where
we
remained
during
the
night
in
the
open
air
being
obliged
to
light
a
fire
on
account
of
the
coldness
of
the
weather
though
in
the
middle
of
summer
on
the
of
the
same
month
we
arrived
at
which
belongs
to
the
king
of
georgia
this
city
is
built
on
a
plain
watered
by
a
large
river
and
is
defended
by
a
citadel
which
is
built
upon
a
rock
our
guide
notified
our
arrival
to
the
commandant
who
ordered
us
a
house
for
our
lodgings
apparently
for
the
purpose
of
extorting
a
present
for
shortly
afterwards
he
informed
me
that
he
had
letters
from
the
king
by
which
he
was
ordered
to
receive
ducats
from
me
for
himself
and
that
i
should
pay
six
to
my
guide
i
endeavoured
to
evade
this
demand
by
saying
that
the
king
had
received
me
favourably
to
whom
i
had
already
given
seventy
ducats
and
could
not
give
any
thing
more
and
urged
my
free
passport
but
he
would
listen
to
nothing
i
could
urge
and
i
was
forced
to
comply
with
his
extortion
he
even
detained
me
till
the
of
the
month
and
even
then
i
had
extreme
difficulty
to
get
leave
to
depart
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
who
deserve
rather
to
be
ranked
among
beasts
looked
at
us
with
as
much
astonishment
as
if
they
had
never
seen
any
other
men
than
ourselves
they
told
us
that
on
the
top
of
a
high
mountain
in
a
neighbouring
forest
there
was
a
great
church
in
which
was
an
image
of
the
virgin
which
worked
many
miracles
and
that
the
church
was
served
by
forty
monks
whom
they
named
but
our
anxiety
to
get
out
of
this
abominable
country
prevented
us
from
paying
our
devotions
at
that
famous
church
georgia
indeed
is
a
somewhat
better
country
than
mingrelia
but
the
manners
of
the
people
and
their
way
of
living
is
equally
brutal
and
such
were
the
distresses
and
difficulties
i
encountered
in
travelling
through
both
that
it
would
be
tedious
to
relate
them
on
the
of
july
we
left
the
abominable
city
of
goride
where
we
had
suffered
so
many
vexations
and
continued
our
journey
through
forests
and
over
mountains
occasionally
falling
in
with
villages
where
we
purchased
provisions
we
had
always
to
pass
the
nights
on
the
ground
near
some
spring
or
rivulet
during
most
part
of
our
journey
through
mingrelia
and
georgia
we
have
already
seen
that
it
was
the
of
that
month
when
contarini
arrived
at
kaffa
much
confusion
has
occurred
in
the
dates
of
this
journey
which
we
have
no
means
of
correcting
and
must
therefore
be
contented
with
them
as
they
are
the
names
of
places
in
this
journal
are
so
corrupted
as
to
be
often
quite
unintelligible
varsi
may
possibly
be
vardon
in
the
district
to
the
northwest
of
mingrelia
named
abkhas
and
caltichea
may
perhaps
be
sulhuali
a
sea
port
about
miles
to
the
east
phasis
probably
refers
to
some
town
on
the
river
of
that
name
perhaps
e
probably
cutais
in
imeritia
on
the
river
e
perhaps
sarassan
about
forty
miles
from
e
apparently
the
same
prince
named
plangion
a
little
e
gori
in
georgia
on
the
river
kur
the
journey
hitherto
must
have
been
through
mingrelia
then
apparently
subject
to
the
prince
or
king
of
e
probably
e
section
iii
of
contarini
at
tauris
or
ecbatana
the
royal
city
of
hassan
and
continuation
of
his
journey
through
persia
to
ispahan
where
the
king
then
on
the
of
july
we
began
to
ascend
a
mountain
of
prodigious
height
insomuch
that
when
night
came
on
we
had
scarcely
reached
the
top
where
we
had
to
pass
the
night
without
water
resuming
our
journey
in
the
morning
we
descended
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
and
entered
the
province
of
armenia
which
is
under
the
dominion
of
in
the
evening
we
were
conducted
to
a
fort
named
reo
which
stands
in
the
plain
between
a
deep
river
and
a
high
mountain
and
which
is
garrisoned
by
turks
in
the
service
of
but
the
neighbouring
village
is
inhabited
by
armenians
we
rested
in
this
place
till
the
of
july
waiting
the
arrival
of
a
guide
to
direct
us
in
the
remainder
of
the
journey
and
being
well
treated
by
the
inhabitants
we
rewarded
them
to
their
satisfaction
the
armenian
who
had
joined
us
at
kaffa
under
pretence
of
being
an
ambassador
from
to
the
pope
was
recognized
by
the
inhabitants
of
this
village
as
an
impostor
and
a
notorious
robber
and
many
were
astonished
how
we
had
escaped
from
his
machinations
i
got
rid
of
him
therefore
immediately
and
made
him
restore
me
a
horse
which
i
had
lent
him
for
the
journey
after
which
i
procured
a
priest
of
an
honest
character
to
conduct
me
to
tauris
leaving
reo
with
my
new
guide
on
the
of
july
we
ascended
a
mountain
and
came
on
the
other
side
to
a
plain
surrounded
by
hills
where
we
found
a
village
inhabited
by
turks
near
which
we
had
to
pass
the
night
in
the
open
air
though
the
inhabitants
treated
us
with
decent
civility
next
morning
we
departed
before
day
having
to
pass
another
mountain
on
the
side
of
which
was
a
village
inhabited
by
turks
among
whom
we
should
have
run
extreme
hazard
of
our
lives
if
they
had
seen
us
but
by
using
much
diligence
we
avoided
this
danger
and
got
down
into
an
extensive
plain
full
of
fine
pastures
and
travelled
with
great
expedition
that
we
might
pass
the
night
at
a
respectable
distance
from
the
lawless
inhabitants
of
the
hills
on
the
we
passed
the
mountain
of
noah
or
which
is
so
lofty
that
it
is
covered
with
snow
the
whole
year
we
were
told
that
many
who
had
attempted
to
reach
the
top
of
this
mountain
had
never
been
more
heard
of
while
others
on
making
the
same
attempt
said
on
their
return
that
it
was
quite
inaccessible
from
this
place
forwards
we
travelled
through
extensive
plains
intermixed
with
hills
and
arrived
on
the
of
july
at
a
castle
named
inhabited
by
armenians
finding
abundance
of
bread
wine
and
poultry
in
this
place
we
rested
here
for
a
day
and
then
set
out
with
a
new
guide
for
ecbatana
or
tauris
leaving
chiagri
towards
evening
of
the
august
we
came
next
day
to
an
armenian
village
at
the
foot
of
a
mountain
where
we
had
to
cross
a
river
in
boats
and
were
informed
that
had
formerly
gained
a
great
victory
near
this
place
over
the
tartars
having
hemmed
them
into
a
corner
where
their
army
wasted
away
with
famine
and
disease
the
ruler
of
these
tartars
named
sultan
was
made
prisoner
and
was
afterwards
put
to
death
we
here
saw
on
our
left
hand
eleven
armenian
villages
near
each
other
who
were
catholic
christians
their
bishop
being
under
submission
to
the
roman
pontiff
the
country
is
extremely
agreeable
and
is
the
most
fertile
of
all
the
provinces
of
persia
we
arrived
on
the
of
august
at
a
large
village
called
marerich
near
which
we
passed
the
night
and
had
to
ride
all
the
next
day
through
a
plain
country
exposed
to
great
heat
which
was
greatly
aggravated
as
we
could
not
procure
a
single
drop
of
water
for
ourselves
or
our
horses
on
the
way
we
met
several
turkmans
whose
custom
it
is
to
encamp
here
and
there
about
the
country
wherever
they
can
find
pasture
for
their
cattle
and
to
change
their
residence
as
the
pastures
become
exhausted
these
people
are
abominable
robbers
and
look
upon
rapine
as
their
highest
glory
and
as
we
had
great
reason
to
be
afraid
of
them
i
gave
orders
to
all
my
people
to
tell
whoever
we
met
that
i
was
journeying
to
wait
upon
their
sovereign
which
was
the
only
expedient
for
saving
us
from
their
violence
we
arrived
on
the
of
august
at
the
city
of
ecbatana
or
which
stands
in
a
plain
and
is
surrounded
by
an
earthen
rampart
in
bad
repair
there
are
high
mountains
in
its
neighbourhood
which
are
said
to
be
the
taurus
of
the
ancients
i
here
lodged
with
a
very
good
man
who
gave
us
two
sleeping
chambers
a
convenience
we
had
been
long
unused
to
he
was
quite
astonished
how
we
should
have
been
able
to
escape
the
dangers
of
our
journey
as
all
the
roads
were
blocked
up
and
on
asking
him
the
reason
he
told
us
that
ogurlu
mohammed
the
eldest
son
of
had
rebelled
against
his
father
and
had
taken
possession
of
or
persepolis
of
which
he
had
appointed
his
younger
brother
as
governor
had
assembled
an
army
to
reduce
persepolis
and
his
sons
to
obedience
but
a
certain
satrap
named
who
commanded
in
the
neighbouring
mountains
favoured
the
cause
of
ogurlu
and
had
ravaged
the
whole
country
to
the
very
gates
of
tauris
with
a
body
of
horse
owing
to
which
all
the
roads
were
obstructed
and
unsafe
he
farther
informed
us
that
the
governor
of
tauris
had
one
day
issued
forth
to
endeavour
to
put
a
stop
to
the
marauders
but
had
been
defeated
by
zagarli
with
the
loss
of
most
of
his
troops
and
had
even
great
difficulty
in
escaping
back
to
the
city
i
inquired
why
the
inhabitants
of
tauris
did
not
take
arms
in
their
own
defence
in
a
time
of
so
much
danger
but
he
answered
although
they
were
obedient
to
the
governor
they
were
quite
unused
to
war
on
learning
the
state
of
affairs
in
this
place
i
resolved
to
leave
it
as
soon
as
possible
that
i
might
get
to
the
king
but
i
could
neither
procure
a
guide
nor
prevail
on
the
governor
to
shew
me
any
favour
by
the
advice
of
my
landlord
i
kept
myself
very
much
concealed
and
employed
my
interpreter
and
augustin
of
pavia
whom
i
had
brought
with
me
from
kaffa
because
he
understood
a
little
persian
to
purchase
our
provisions
in
which
employment
they
were
exposed
to
much
ill
treatment
and
were
often
in
hazard
of
their
lives
some
days
afterwards
one
of
the
sons
of
named
came
to
tauris
with
horse
to
defend
the
city
from
the
incursions
of
zagarli
i
waited
on
this
prince
having
great
difficulty
to
obtain
an
audience
telling
him
that
i
was
sent
as
ambassador
to
his
father
and
had
need
of
guides
whom
i
prayed
him
to
provide
me
but
it
was
quite
ineffectual
as
he
hardly
deigned
to
answer
me
and
took
no
kind
of
interest
in
me
or
my
affairs
so
that
i
was
obliged
to
return
disappointed
to
my
lodgings
endeavoured
to
raise
money
from
the
inhabitants
of
tauris
for
the
purpose
of
levying
soldiers
but
they
resisted
his
demands
and
all
the
shops
of
the
city
were
shut
up
in
this
emergency
being
unable
to
procure
provisions
i
was
obliged
to
quit
my
lodgings
with
all
my
people
taking
refuge
in
an
armenian
church
where
they
gave
us
a
small
place
in
which
to
keep
our
horses
and
i
ordered
all
my
people
to
keep
constantly
within
doors
to
avoid
meeting
with
injury
my
apprehensions
on
this
occasion
may
easily
be
conceived
but
god
who
had
already
protected
us
in
so
many
dangers
was
mercifully
pleased
to
deliver
us
from
that
which
now
hung
over
us
on
the
of
september
whom
i
had
before
seen
at
kaffa
and
who
had
been
sent
by
our
illustrious
republic
arrived
at
tauris
he
was
accompanied
by
his
nephew
named
and
having
come
by
way
of
trebisond
was
a
month
later
than
me
in
reaching
tauris
i
now
dispatched
augustin
de
pavia
of
whom
i
have
before
made
mention
with
letters
to
the
republic
of
venice
in
which
i
gave
an
account
to
the
senate
of
all
that
had
happened
to
us
hitherto
i
sent
this
man
by
way
of
alapia
where
he
at
length
arrived
in
good
health
after
having
escaped
many
dangers
although
i
remained
in
tauris
till
the
of
september
i
was
not
able
to
acquire
any
exact
knowledge
of
the
city
having
been
forced
to
conceal
myself
the
whole
time
it
is
a
large
city
but
its
territory
in
some
places
is
uncultivated
and
i
believe
nowhere
very
populous
it
abounds
however
in
all
the
necessaries
of
life
but
these
are
dear
much
silk
is
produced
in
this
neighbourhood
which
is
exported
by
way
of
alapia
a
considerable
quantity
of
cloth
is
manufactured
in
the
place
which
likewise
abounds
in
various
merchandize
but
i
did
not
hear
of
any
pearls
or
precious
stones
fortunately
for
us
a
cadilaskir
one
of
the
counsellors
of
arrived
about
this
time
at
tauris
who
returned
from
an
embassy
into
turkey
where
he
had
unsuccessfully
endeavoured
to
negociate
a
peace
between
his
master
and
the
turkish
government
immediately
on
learning
the
arrival
of
this
person
i
used
every
effort
to
procure
an
interview
in
which
i
succeeded
and
by
means
of
a
present
i
prevailed
on
him
to
admit
me
and
my
retinue
into
his
suite
he
received
me
with
much
civility
and
granted
all
i
asked
assuring
me
that
with
the
blessing
of
god
he
would
conduct
me
in
safety
to
the
king
among
his
slaves
there
were
two
illyrian
renegadoes
who
formed
a
strict
intimacy
with
my
people
to
whom
they
promised
to
give
every
assistance
in
their
power
and
to
give
us
due
notice
of
the
departure
of
their
master
which
they
faithfully
performed
and
for
which
i
rewarded
them
on
the
of
september
we
departed
from
tauris
with
the
persian
counsellor
accompanied
likewise
by
a
great
many
merchants
and
others
who
took
the
advantage
of
travelling
under
his
protection
from
fear
of
being
plundered
by
the
rebels
this
country
in
which
we
now
travelled
was
quite
level
with
very
few
hills
so
dry
that
we
saw
no
trees
except
along
the
sides
of
rivers
and
having
only
a
few
small
villages
in
which
we
purchased
what
was
necessary
for
our
journey
and
always
rested
before
in
the
open
air
being
unable
to
travel
during
the
height
of
the
sun
on
account
of
the
great
heat
travelling
in
this
manner
we
arrived
at
on
the
of
september
this
city
appeared
to
be
very
handsome
surrounded
by
walls
and
defended
by
a
good
citadel
we
saw
here
three
most
curious
brazen
gates
which
had
been
made
at
damascus
the
finest
things
i
ever
beheld
which
must
have
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
the
city
of
sultanie
stands
in
a
plain
at
the
foot
of
a
range
of
mountains
some
of
which
are
exceedingly
steep
and
precipitous
and
the
inhabitants
of
which
are
forced
to
remove
into
lower
situations
during
winter
on
account
of
the
severity
of
the
cold
we
remained
there
for
three
days
and
resumed
our
journey
on
the
of
september
travelling
sometimes
in
plains
and
sometimes
among
hills
but
always
taking
up
our
quarters
for
the
night
in
the
open
air
on
the
of
october
we
arrived
at
a
city
without
walls
situated
in
a
plain
on
the
banks
of
a
river
and
surrounded
by
trees
in
which
city
we
passed
the
night
in
tolerably
bad
quarters
we
departed
from
thence
on
the
and
stopping
according
to
our
usual
custom
in
the
fields
i
was
seized
with
a
violent
intermittent
fever
insomuch
that
i
could
hardly
get
on
horseback
next
day
and
that
with
infinite
distress
we
arrived
early
next
day
at
kom
where
i
was
forced
to
stop
all
my
attendants
being
seized
in
a
similar
manner
with
myself
except
our
priest
stephen
testa
who
took
care
of
us
all
our
fever
was
so
malignant
that
we
were
all
delirious
during
the
height
of
the
access
or
hot
fit
i
was
afterwards
informed
that
the
royal
counsellor
sent
to
visit
me
begging
my
excuse
that
he
could
not
wait
for
me
because
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
repair
without
delay
to
the
king
but
that
he
had
left
one
of
his
attendants
with
me
as
a
guide
and
that
i
need
not
now
be
under
any
apprehension
as
there
were
none
in
that
part
of
the
country
to
do
me
harm
i
remained
here
a
long
time
sick
the
city
of
sena
or
sava
is
not
large
and
has
mud
walls
being
situated
in
a
champaign
country
which
is
well
peopled
and
abounds
in
every
thing
necessary
to
life
on
the
of
october
being
much
recovered
we
resumed
our
journey
though
i
was
still
so
weak
as
to
find
much
difficulty
in
sitting
on
horseback
next
day
we
arrived
at
the
city
of
cashan
which
very
much
resembles
kom
except
that
it
is
somewhat
handsomer
on
the
following
day
we
came
to
or
nathan
this
city
stands
likewise
in
a
flat
country
which
produces
much
wine
i
remained
here
one
day
both
to
recruit
my
strength
and
because
i
felt
some
return
of
my
fever
on
the
of
october
i
prepared
as
well
as
i
was
able
to
finish
my
journey
which
was
all
on
plain
ground
and
arrived
at
ispahan
where
then
resided
on
the
of
november
having
employed
four
days
in
our
journey
from
tauris
to
this
place
i
immediately
sought
out
the
dwelling
of
josaphat
barbaro
the
ambassador
of
venice
and
went
to
him
he
received
me
with
much
joy
and
many
embraces
were
mutually
given
and
received
and
we
rejoiced
together
on
my
safe
arrival
but
as
i
had
much
need
of
rest
i
very
soon
went
to
bed
when
the
king
heard
of
my
arrival
he
sent
some
of
his
slaves
to
congratulate
me
who
presented
me
with
some
refreshments
sent
by
his
majesty
early
in
the
morning
of
the
november
some
of
the
kings
slaves
came
to
require
that
josaphat
barbaro
and
i
should
come
to
court
on
being
introduced
to
an
audience
we
found
the
king
attended
by
eight
of
his
principal
officers
having
made
my
obeisance
after
the
manner
of
the
country
i
presented
the
letters
of
the
republic
and
explained
the
subject
of
my
mission
when
i
had
finished
speaking
he
answered
me
in
every
point
and
in
few
words
and
among
other
things
he
excused
his
conduct
in
having
been
obliged
to
retire
to
this
part
of
his
kingdom
after
this
we
were
ordered
to
be
seated
and
his
courtiers
gave
us
an
entertainment
according
to
the
persian
fashion
which
consisted
of
many
dishes
tolerably
well
dressed
after
the
repast
we
took
leave
of
the
king
and
retired
to
our
quarters
two
days
afterwards
we
were
again
sent
for
to
court
when
most
of
the
royal
apartments
were
shewn
me
the
king
then
resided
in
a
very
pleasant
country
palace
situated
on
the
banks
of
a
river
in
one
of
the
rooms
there
was
a
painting
of
mohammed
the
kings
eldest
son
leading
the
sultan
or
abu
saïd
tied
with
a
rope
and
in
another
picture
the
decapitation
of
was
represented
we
were
again
invited
to
an
entertainment
at
which
many
different
kinds
of
confections
were
served
up
we
remained
at
ispahan
till
the
of
november
during
which
period
we
were
frequently
invited
to
court
the
city
of
ispahan
like
the
rest
of
the
persian
cities
is
surrounded
by
it
stands
in
a
plain
and
is
abundantly
supplied
with
all
the
necessaries
of
life
having
rebelled
against
the
king
it
was
besieged
and
suffered
much
injury
for
being
obstinately
defended
it
was
subjected
to
the
resentment
of
the
conqueror
and
the
fury
of
the
soldiers
persia
is
a
very
flat
and
arid
country
in
many
parts
of
which
there
are
salt
lakes
in
such
parts
as
can
be
supplied
with
water
grain
and
other
fruits
of

are
produced
in
abundance
and
there
are
plenty
of
beasts
of
all
kinds
as
it
is
everywhere
intersected
and
surrounded
by
fertile
mountains
but
every
thing
is
very
dear
the
venetian
quart
of
wine
is
sold
for
three
or
four
ducats
but
bread
is
not
so
dear
in
proportion
a
camels
load
of
wood
costs
a
ducat
flesh
is
dearer
than
with
us
and
seven
hens
cost
a
ducat
but
other
articles
of
provisions
are
cheaper
the
persians
are
a
civil
and
humane
people
and
though
mahometans
they
do
not
hate
the
christians
the
women
are
very
modestly
dressed
and
ride
on
horseback
with
even
more
grace
than
the
men

judging
from
the
good
appearance
of
the
men
the
women

probably

their

to
be
noted
that

it
is
difficult
to
determine
whether

lose
themselves
in
the
sands
after
a
short
but
useful
e
about
sixty
miles
from
kom
i
am
disposed
to
think
that
contarini
has
slumpt
his
journey
on
the
present
occasion
as
it
is
hardly
to
be
believed
a
person
in
the
weak
state
he
describes
himself
could
have
travelled
with
so
much
rapidity
besides
so
far
as
we
can
learn
from
his
journal
he
travelled
always
with
the
same
set
of
horses
indeed
the
sequel
immediately
justifies
this
suspicion
as
the
subsequent
dates
are
more
distant
than
the
travelling
days
of
the
text
would
e
see
travels
of
josaphat
barbaro
to
asof
in
in
our
collection
vol
in
the
introduction
to
which
article
it
will
be
seen
that
he
had
been
sent
on
an
embassy
from
venice
to
in
two
years
before
contarini
and
appears
to
have
remained
in
the
east
for
fourteen
years
in
that
capacity
after
the
departure
of
contarini
on
his
return
to
e
this
nowhere
distinctly
appears
but
we
may
easily
understand
incidentally
and
from
the
history
of
the
period
that
the
venetian
republic
endeavoured
to
stir
up
enemies
to
the
turkish
empire
in
the
east
being
unable
to
resist
its
power
now
exerted
against
them
in
the
morea
and
the
greek
islands
and
we
may
even
surmise
that
hassan
was
subsidized
by
the
venetians
to
make
war
upon
the
e
section
iv
accompanies
from
ispahan
to
tauris
where
he
finds
ambassadors
from
the
duke
of
burgundy
and
the
prince
of
muscovy
and
gets
leave
to
return
to
the
king
left
ispahan
with
all
his
court
on
the
of
november
for
tauris
and
we
travelled
along
with
him
passing
through
most
of
the
places
which
we
had
seen
in
going
to
ispahan
in
this
journey
we
always
slept
in
tents
in
the
fields
and
the
camp
was
well
supplied
with
provisions
as
many
merchants
had
received
orders
to
provide
grain
victuals
of
all
kinds
and
all
sorts
of
necessaries
on
the
of
november
we
arrived
at
kom
where
we
remained
two
days
under
tents
exposed
to
extremely
cold
weather
and
experienced
much
difficulty
to
procure
a
small
house
in
which
to
shelter
ourselves
we
continued
at
this
place
till
the
of
march
during
which
interval
we
went
frequently
to
court
to
pay
our
respects
to
the
king
on
which
occasions
we
were
generally
invited
to
dinner
the
persian
court
is
very
magnificent
being
attended
by
many
high
officers
of
state
and
every
day
persons
dine
along
with
the
king
these
are
all
seated
on
the
ground
and
are
served
in
copper
basons
with
boiled
rice
or
some
other
mess
made
of
flesh
and
grain
boiled
together
but
the
king
is
served
in
great
magnificence
at
a
separate
table
with
a
great
variety
of
dishes
of
different
kinds
of
meat
during
his
meals
the
king
is
often
served
with
wine
and
then
the
musicians
sing
and
play
upon
flutes
such
songs
and
tunes
as
the
king
pleases
to
order
the
king
is
of
a
good
size
with
a
thin
visage
and
agreeable
countenance
having
somewhat
of
the
tartar
appearance
and
seemed
to
be
about
seventy
years
old
his
manners
were
very
affable
and
he
conversed
familiarly
with
every
one
around
him
but
i
noticed
that
his
hands
trembled
when
he
raised
the
cup
to
his
lips
it
is
not
needful
that
i
should
enumerate
all
the
audiences
which
i
had
on
the
subject
of
my
mission
of
which
i
shall
make
occasional
mention
hereafter
on
the
of
march
the
king
and
all
the
court
left
kom
on
their
journey
towards
tauris
the
baggage
being
carried
by
camels
and
mules
each
day
we
hardly
exceeded
ten
or
twelve
or
at
the
most
twenty
italian
miles
and
always
stopt
at
each
encampment
till
the
forage
in
the
neighbourhood
was
consumed
the
persian
mode
of
travelling
is
thus
the
women
always
arrive
first
at
the
new
camp
where
they
set
up
the
tents
and
cook
provisions
for
their
husbands
they
are
well
clothed
and
ride
upon
good
horses
which
they
manage
with
much
dexterity
the
persian
nation
is
very
magnificent
and
exceedingly
fond
of
pomp
and
shew
and
it
is
very
agreeable
to
see
their
march
at
some
distance
they
are
very
careful
of
their
camels
of
which
they
have
great
numbers
even
the
poorest
seldom
travelling
with
less
than
seven
of
these
animals
by
this
means
the
prodigious
train
which
attends
the
court
appears
to
consist
of
many
more
persons
than
it
actually
contains
when
the
king
entered
ecbatana
his
suite
consisted
of
about
persons
but
many
left
the
camp
on
the
march
as
it
suited
their
fancy
or
convenience
and
the
king
never
had
above
horse
along
with
him
the
royal
tents
were
exceedingly
beautiful
and
magnificent
and
his
bed
was
ornamented
with
scarlet
hangings
the
merchants
who
attended
the
camp
sold
every
thing
at
a
high
price
all
of
our
party
were
accommodated
with
tents
as
we
belonged
to
the
suite
of
the
king
who
often
honoured
us
with
an
invitation
to
supper
and
at
other
times
frequently
sent
us
refreshments
we
were
always
treated
with
much
civility
and
never
received
any
injuries
or
affronts
on
the
of
may
the
king
encamped
about
fifteen
miles
from
tauris
when
a
certain
monk
of
the
boulonnois
named
louis
who
called
himself
patriarch
of
antioch
and
envoy
from
the
duke
of
burgundy
arrived
at
the
camp
attended
by
five
horsemen
the
king
asked
if
we
knew
him
and
we
accordingly
told
what
we
knew
without
dissimulation
next
day
the
king
gave
him
an
audience
at
which
we
were
present
by
command
this
patriarch
presented
to
the
king
three
robes
of
gold
tissue
three
others
of
scarlet
silk
and
some
of
fine
cloth
and
opened
his
commission
making
many
great
offers
of
service
from
his
prince
and
many
fine
promises
in
very
magnificent
terms
which
do
not
appear
proper
for
me
to
repeat
and
which
the
king
did
not
seem
to
care
much
about
we
were
all
invited
to
dinner
during
which
the
king
started
many
questions
to
which
he
gave
very
pertinent
answers
himself
after
dinner
we
returned
to
our
tents
on
the
of
june
we
arrived
at
tauris
in
which
place
lodgings
were
appointed
for
us
six
days
afterwards
sent
for
the
patriarch
and
us
to
court
and
although
he
had
three
or
four
times
informed
me
already
that
i
must
prepare
to
return
into
italy
leaving
my
colleague
barbaro
at
his
court
i
could
not
reconcile
myself
to
the
journey
and
had
done
every
thing
in
my
power
to
put
off
my
departure
when
we
went
to
court
the
king
addressed
himself
first
to
the
patriarch
whom
he
ordered
to
return
to
his
prince
and
to
say
from
him
that
he
the
king
would
very
shortly
declare
war
against
the
turks
having
already
taken
the
field
with
that
view
and
that
he
never
failed
in
performing
his
promises
he
then
turned
to
me
saying
return
to
your
country
and
tell
your
masters
that
i
shall
very
soon
make
war
upon
the
ottomans
and
desire
them
to
do
their
duty
as
i
shall
do
mine
i
know
no
one
better
fitted
to
carry
this
message
than
you
who
have
accompanied
me
from
ispahan
and
have
seen
my
preparations
so
that
you
are
able
to
inform
the
christian
princes
of
all
that
you
have
seen
and
of
my
good
intentions
i
offered
several
reasons
for
excusing
myself
from
obeying
these
commands
which
gave
me
much
vexation
but
the
king
looked
at
me
with
a
severe
expression
of
countenance
saying
it
is
my
pleasure
for
you
to
go
and
i
command
you
i
shall
give
you
letters
for
your
masters
which
will
inform
them
of
my
sentiments
and
the
reasons
of
your
return
in
this
state
of
embarrassment
i
was
advised
by
the
patriarch
and
josaphat
to
comply
with
a
good
grace
on
which
i
replied
to
the
king
as
follows
my
departure
sir
gives
me
much
distress
but
since
you
judge
it
proper
i
make
no
more
objections
and
am
ready
to
obey
your
orders
wherever
i
may
go
i
shall
speak
of
your
great
power
and
goodness
and
the
honours
i
have
received
from
your
majesty
and
shall
exhort
all
the
princes
of
christendom
to
join
their
forces
with
you
against
the
common
enemy
my
speech
pleased
the
king
and
he
answered
me
kindly
according
to
his
wonted
manner
after
retiring
from
this
andienqe
the
king
sent
some
persian
robes
to
the
patriarch
and
me
made
of
fine
stuff
and
very
beautifully
ornamented
and
presented
each
of
us
with
a
horse
and
some
money
to
assist
us
during
our
journey
we
remained
two
days
at
tauris
after
the
kings
departure
and
set
out
on
the
of
june
to
rejoin
the
court
which
was
then
encamped
in
a
pleasant
spot
among
excellent
pastures
and
plenty
of
fine
wells
about
miles
from
tauris
we
remained
there
till
the
pastures
were
eaten
bare
and
then
marched
about
fifteen
miles
farther
on
the
of
june
the
king
gave
us
our
final
audience
at
which
he
gave
us
presents
for
our
respective
sovereigns
that
is
to
say
to
the
patriarch
for
the
duke
of
burgundy
to
myself
for
the
republic
and
to
one
marcus
ruffus
who
had
come
with
an
embassy
from
the
prince
of
muscovy
the
presents
consisted
in
certain
pieces
of
workmanship
made
in
the
european
fashion
two
swords
and
certain
ornaments
for
the
head
which
are
usually
fastened
to
bonnets
there
were
two
persian
ambassadors
in
the
chamber
one
of
whom
was
destined
on
a
mission
into
russia
at
length
the
king
turning
towards
the
patriarch
and
me
addressed
us
nearly
as
follows
you
will
return
with
all
speed
to
your
masters
and
will
tell
them
and
all
the
other
christian
princes
from
me
that
i
have
used
all
diligence
in
taking
the
field
to
make
war
on
the
turks
as
it
had
been
concerted
between
them
and
me
the
emperor
of
the
turks
is
at
present
in
constantinople
and
will
make
no
enterprize
of
importance
this
year
as
for
myself
i
propose
sending
one
part
of
my
army
to
reduce
my
rebellious
son
and
another
against
the
turkish
generals
while
i
shall
remain
here
at
hand
to
act
against
the
enemy
as
occasion
may
require
he
gave
orders
both
to
us
and
to
his
own
ambassadors
to
report
this
to
all
the
princes
of
christendom
i
did
not
receive
these
orders
with
more
satisfaction
than
i
had
done
the
former
but
i
had
no
means
of
escape
and
must
necessarily
obey
wherefore
having
taken
our
leaves
we
prepared
for
our
departure
and
were
unexpectedly
commanded
to
remain
till
next
day
in
the
mean
time
he
conveyed
a
great
part
of
his
infantry
during
the
night
to
the
other
side
of
a
mountain
next
morning
early
the
or
conductor
of
ambassadors
carried
us
to
the
top
of
the
hill
as
meaning
to
confer
with
us
on
some
important
subject
and
on
the
appearance
of
the
persian
infantry
under
march
he
pointed
them
out
to
us
as
if
he
had
been
surprised
at
seeing
so
many
additional
troops
coming
to
the
royal
camp
the
better
to
favour
this
deception
some
of
his
slaves
exclaimed
as
astonished
that
there
were
a
great
many
soldiers
and
that
at
least
were
coming
to
reinforce
the
army
but
we
easily
saw
through
the
contrivance
and
were
certain
that
these
pretended
new
troops
were
merely
the
ordinary
royal
escort
which
had
only
changed
their
position
to
impose
upon
us
after
this
little
comedy
the
gave
us
the
royal
letters
for
our
masters
and
we
returned
to
our
tents
from
the
information
of
josaphat
and
others
the
military
force
of
this
king
can
not
exceed
cavalry
some
of
whom
have
wooden
bucklers
about
eighteen
inches
long
others
have
a
kind
of
cuirasses
made
of
very
thin
plates
of
steel
which
they
wear
over
their
ordinary
habits
their
usual
arms
are
bows
and
arrows
and
cimeters
while
some
have
small
leathern
targets
covered
with
silk
and
others
carry
helmets
and
cuirasses
their
horses
are
beautiful
and
vigorous
and
very
numerous
in
regard
to
the
manners
of
the
persians
and
the
state
of
the
kingdom
i
shall
mention
what
i
know
of
these
subjects
as
occasion
may
offer
during
the
recital
of
my
travels
but
i
do
not
think
it
proper
to
weary
my
readers
with
any
lengthened
detail
section
of
contarini
from
persia
through
georgia
and
mingrelia
to
the
city
being
entirely
ready
to
depart
on
the
of
july
we
took
leave
of
josaphat
barbaro
in
his
tent
when
we
mutually
shed
tears
in
sincere
grief
at
our
separation
having
recommended
myself
to
the
protection
of
god
i
mounted
on
horseback
and
began
my
journey
accompanied
by
the
patriarch
of
antioch
marcus
ruffus
the
muscovite
and
the
two
persian
ambassadors
intending
to
return
by
way
of
phasis
which
is
under
the
dominion
of
to
this
route
we
were
advised
by
certain
birds
of
bad
augury
who
were
omens
of
the
terrible
dangers
we
had
to
encounter
in
the
sequel
coming
to
the
villages
of
the
catholic
armenians
formerly
mentioned
we
were
well
received
by
their
bishops
and
attended
the
mass
regularly
during
three
days
that
we
had
to
remain
here
laying
in
a
stock
of
provisions
for
the
journey
from
thence
we
came
to
the
frontiers
of
georgia
travelling
through
plains
interspersed
with
hills
and
arrived
on
the
of
july
at
which
is
subject
to
the
king
of
the
georgians
this
city
stands
upon
a
hill
at
the
foot
of
which
runs
the
river
and
it
is
defended
by
a
good
castle
on
the
summit
of
an
eminence
it
was
formerly
a
celebrated
place
but
is
at
present
almost
utterly
ruined
though
beginning
to
revive
and
contains
many
good
catholics
in
this
place
we
took
up
our
lodgings
with
a
person
named
arminius
of
the
catholic
faith
in
travelling
through
georgia
we
found
a
few
villages
composed
of
huts
and
some
castles
among
the
mountains
but
these
were
rare
and
distant
on
the
of
july
being
near
the
frontiers
of
mingrelia
we
chanced
to
meet
with
pangratius
king
of
georgia
in
the
midst
of
a
forest
surrounded
by
mountains
and
went
to
pay
our
respects
to
him
when
he
invited
us
to
dinner
we
had
to
sit
on
the
ground
having
a
skin
spread
before
us
instead
of
a
and
were
served
with
roasted
meat
and
fowls
very
ill
dressed
but
by
way
of
making
amends
they
frequently
presented
us
with
large
goblets
of
wine
as
they
seem
to
place
all
dignity
and
merit
in
deep
drinking
for
this
reason
it
is
their
custom
at
the
conclusion
of
their
meals
to
challenge
one
another
to
drink
and
he
who
empties
the
greatest
number
of
goblets
is
held
in
highest
esteem
as
the
turks
drink
no
wine
their
presence
was
some
restraint
that
day
on
their
usual
bacchanalian
contests
and
as
we
neither
could
nor
would
compete
with
them
we
were
held
in
great
contempt
the
king
was
about
forty
years
old
and
of
large
make
with
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
tartar
countenance
we
parted
from
the
king
of
georgia
next
day
and
on
the
of
july
on
the
confines
of
mingrelia
we
fell
in
with
a
georgian
commander
at
the
head
of
some
troops
both
cavalry
and
infantry
who
was
posted
in
this
place
to
prevent
injury
from
the
disorders
that
had
broke
out
in
mingrelia
in
consequence
of
the
death
of
bendian
prince
of
that
country
these
people
stopped
and
frightened
us
with
many
cruel
menaces
but
at
length
after
being
robbed
of
two
quivers
full
of
arrows
and
having
to
gratify
them
with
some
money
we
escaped
from
them
and
made
the
best
of
our
way
to
a
distance
leaving
the
public
road
we
struck
off
into
a
thick
wood
where
we
passed
the
night
in
prodigious
apprehension
on
the
following
day
while
approaching
the
city
of
we
met
some
peasants
in
a
narrow
pass
who
prevented
us
for
some
time
from
going
forwards
and
even
threatened
to
put
us
to
death
after
much
altercation
and
many
threats
they
seized
three
horses
belonging
to
the
turks
which
were
with
great
difficulty
redeemed
for
twenty
ducats
on
the
evening
we
reached
cutais
which
is
a
royal
fortress
while
passing
a
bridge
over
a
river
early
in
the
morning
of
the
of
july
we
were
again
attacked
by
robbers
who
came
upon
us
suddenly
and
after
many
threats
forced
us
to
pay
the
full
value
of
our
horses
before
they
would
allow
us
to
continue
our
journey
after
passing
this
bridge
we
entered
mingrelia
where
we
followed
our
wonted
custom
of
sleeping
under
the
canopy
of
heaven
though
we
had
many
worse
inconveniencies
and
dangers
to
encounter
for
on
the
of
july
having
passed
over
a
river
by
means
of
rafts
we
were
conducted
to
the
dwelling
of
a
certain
lady
named
sister
of
the
deceased
prince
badian
who
received
us
at
first
with
much
civility
and
treated
us
with
bread
and
wine
after
which
we
were
conducted
into
a
field
belonging
to
her
which
was
close
shut
on
all
sides
on
the
morrow
when
we
were
about
to
depart
we
offered
her
a
present
of
twenty
ducats
as
a
return
for
her
hospitality
which
at
first
she
pretended
to
refuse
but
we
soon
discovered
her
treachery
as
she
insisted
on
our
paying
two
ducats
as
a
ransom
for
each
of
our
horses
we
expressed
our
astonishment
at
this
rapacity
and
endeavoured
to
represent
our
inability
to
comply
with
such
exorbitant
demands
but
all
to
no
purpose
and
we
were
forced
to
comply
being
afraid
that
she
might
even
have
plundered
us
of
every
thing
leaving
this
rapacious
dame
we
arrived
at
on
the
of
july
some
on
horseback
and
others
in
boats
where
we
again
lodged
with
the
circassian
lady
whom
i
formerly
mentioned
after
having
run
many
risks
in
our
journey
we
here
learnt
a
piece
of
most
afflictive
news
that
the
turks
had
taken
possession
of
kaffa
or
theodosia
in
the
crimea
by
which
we
were
deprived
of
our
last
resource
and
shut
out
apparently
from
every
hope
of
continuing
our
voyage
homewards
our
distress
on
receiving
this
intelligence
may
easily
be
conceived
and
in
fact
we
were
so
much
cast
down
as
not
to
know
what
measures
to
pursue
or
to
which
hand
to
turn
us
louis
the
patriarch
of
antioch
resolved
upon
going
through
tartary
and
russia
with
which
route
he
was
acquainted
it
was
to
no
purpose
that
i
urged
the
promises
we
had
mutually
come
under
at
the
beginning
of
our
journey
never
to
separate
on
any
account
to
this
he
answered
that
the
unforeseen
circumstances
which
had
occurred
were
a
sufficient
warrant
to
every
one
to
consult
his
own
individual
safety
i
insisted
and
beseeched
him
not
to
treat
me
with
such
unfeeling
cruelty
but
all
in
vain
for
he
prepared
to
set
off
along
with
the
turkish
ambassador
who
had
been
sent
by
as
his
particular
companion
in
this
extremity
i
went
to
marcus
ruffus
and
the
turkish
ambassador
who
was
joined
with
him
by
the
king
of
persia
to
whom
i
mentioned
my
intention
of
returning
back
to
they
pretended
to
approve
my
plan
and
even
to
join
me
and
we
embraced
as
entering
into
promise
of
keeping
together
but
they
secretly
came
to
a
determination
of
taking
their
journey
through
the
province
of
which
is
subject
to
and
to
the
city
of
which
is
on
the
frontiers
of
the
turks
and
pays
tribute
to
the
grand
signior
the
patriarch
set
out
on
the
of
august
and
the
next
day
marcus
ruffus
followed
him
accompanied
by
several
russians
partly
on
horseback
and
partly
by
means
of
boats
their
intentions
were
to
travel
from
vati
by
shamaki
anciently
cyropolis
and
thence
into
tartary
thus
left
alone
in
a
strange
land
i
leave
any
reasonable
person
to
think
what
were
the
embarrassments
with
which
i
was
surrounded
i
was
unacquainted
with
a
single
individual
having
no
company
but
that
of
my
domestics
and
had
very
little
money
remaining
in
short
i
was
reduced
almost
to
despair
of
ever
being
able
to
get
out
of
the
country
in
this
state
of
distress
i
fell
into
a
violent
fever
and
could
get
no
other
nourishment
but
bread
and
water
and
a
pullet
occasionally
with
much
difficulty
and
my
fever
increased
to
such
a
degree
that
i
became
delirious
all
my
domestics
were
attacked
soon
after
with
the
same
fever
the
priest
stephen
only
excepted
who
had
to
take
care
of
us
all
my
only
bed
was
a
wretched
mattress
which
had
been
lent
me
by
a
person
named
john
volcan
and
my
life
was
despaired
of
by
every
one
till
the
of
september
when
by
the
cares
of
stephen
and
of
martha
my
good
hostess
or
rather
through
the
mercy
of
god
the
fever
abated
and
i
soon
recovered
my
former
health
to
the
astonishment
of
every
one
my
domestics
likewise
recovered
and
we
began
again
to
consult
on
the
best
means
of
escaping
out
of
our
present
situation
some
proposed
to
take
the
road
of
syria
but
i
deemed
this
too
dangerous
and
we
at
length
came
to
the
determination
of
going
by
shamaki
into
tartary
and
thence
by
russia
poland
and
germany
i
got
accordingly
on
horseback
on
the
of
september
but
had
hardly
rode
two
miles
when
i
was
forced
to
dismount
and
rest
myself
on
the
ground
i
was
therefore
obliged
to
return
to
my
lodging
in
phasis
where
we
remained
till
the
when
being
all
of
us
restored
to
health
and
strength
we
again
resumed
our
journey
after
having
implored
the
protection
and
assistance
of
god
i
now
took
a
certain
greek
into
my
service
who
could
speak
the
mingrelian
language
who
occasioned
me
a
thousand
troubles
which
it
were
tedious
to
recount
this
in
all
probability
is
a
corruption
of
tiflis
or
teffliz
the
capital
of
georgia
georgia
which
is
situated
on
the
river
kur
or
cyrus
erroneously
named
in
the
text
the
proper
name
of
this
country
is
or
the
country
of
the
gurgi
which
has
been
corrupted
by
the
europeans
into
e
cutais
in
imeritia
named
cotachis
on
a
former
occasion
in
the
text
these
turks
must
have
been
the
persian
ambassadors
of
this
proposed
route
seems
to
have
been
through
the
province
of
to
batum
and
from
the
sequel
to
have
returned
to
georgia
and
shirvan
passing
through
derbent
and
the
caspian
gates
or
daghisten
into
western
tartary
but
the
names
in
the
text
are
too
corrupt
for
any
certainty
calcicanus
in
the
text
is
probably
a
corruption
of
kalo
johannes
who
was
then
prince
or
emperor
of
e
section
vi
phasis
contarini
travels
through
mingrelia
and
georgia
into
media
and
passing
the
caspian
arrives
in
leaving
phasis
as
before
mentioned
on
the
of
september
and
taking
the
road
of
mingrelia
we
came
to
or
cutais
on
the
of
that
month
extremely
worn
out
through
the
consequences
of
our
late
illness
and
the
fatigues
of
the
journey
and
as
the
greek
whom
i
had
hired
never
ceased
to
give
me
vexation
i
here
parted
with
him
as
handsomely
as
i
could
we
remained
two
days
at
cutais
among
people
who
knew
us
not
and
whose
language
we
were
quite
ignorant
of
leaving
that
place
and
tracing
back
our
former
steps
we
passed
over
several
mountains
in
much
fear
and
arrived
at
tiflis
on
the
of
september
where
we
took
shelter
in
the
chapel
of
a
certain
armenian
catholic
who
had
more
the
appearance
of
a
dead
person
than
of
a
living
man
but
who
rendered
us
every
possible
service
this
man
had
a
son
who
lived
with
him
and
who
unfortunately
for
us
was
seized
with
the
plague
which
had
raged
in
that
part
of
the
country
this
year
from
him
one
of
my
servants
named
maffeo
of
bergamo
caught
the
distemper
who
still
kept
about
me
during
two
days
though
ill
as
he
was
my
own
particular
domestic
at
length
growing
worse
he
had
to
take
to
his
bed
when
the
distemper
shewed
itself
and
as
he
lay
in
the
same
room
with
me
and
the
house
could
not
afford
me
another
i
was
forced
to
take
refuge
in
a
hovel
where
some
cows
were
kept
at
night
and
as
the
armenian
refused
to
allow
maffeo
to
remain
in
his
house
i
was
constrained
to
take
him
into
the
same
place
with
myself
where
stephen
took
care
of
him
till
god
pleased
to
take
him
out
of
the
world
after
the
death
of
maffeo
i
experienced
great
difficulty
to
procure
another
stable
for
myself
that
i
might
get
away
from
the
morbid
air
of
that
in
which
my
poor
servant
died
in
this
extremity
we
were
utterly
abandoned
except
by
one
old
man
who
understood
a
little
of
our
language
and
who
served
us
with
much
affection
we
remained
at
this
place
till
the
october
and
on
the
evening
before
our
intended
departure
the
persian
ambassador
who
had
accompanied
the
patriarch
came
to
tiflis
he
complained
grievously
of
having
been
plundered
through
the
fault
of
the
patriarch
with
whom
he
had
travelled
to
where
he
had
left
him
and
was
now
on
his
road
to
complain
to
we
agreed
to
travel
in
company
from
tiflis
a
city
belonging
to
pancratis
from
thence
in
two
days
we
entered
the
territories
of
as
we
took
the
road
towards
shamaki
or
cyropolis
which
is
situated
in
a
fertile
and
pleasant
country
on
the
of
october
we
separated
as
the
persian
went
to
hassan
at
tauris
and
i
took
the
road
for
the
dominions
of
in
which
shamaki
stands
but
by
means
of
the
persian
ambassador
i
procurred
a
or
mahometan
priest
to
guide
me
on
the
road
to
shamaki
this
country
is
greatly
more
beautiful
and
more
fertile
than
the
dominions
of
and
is
ruled
over
by
king
of
media
of
this
country
shamaki
is
the
capital
at
which
place
i
arrived
on
the
november
this
city
is
not
so
large
as
tauris
but
as
far
as
i
could
judge
surpasses
that
place
in
the
goodness
and
abundance
of
every
thing
especially
in
excellent
cattle
it
produces
great
quantities
of
excellent
silk
of
which
they
manufacture
various
kinds
of
very
slight
stuffs
while
here
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
rejoined
by
marcus
ruffus
the
muscovite
ambassador
who
had
parted
from
me
at
phasis
as
formerly
related
immediately
on
learning
that
i
was
in
the
city
he
came
to
visit
me
and
we
embraced
with
cordiality
i
now
earnestly
entreated
him
to
receive
me
and
my
domestics
into
his
society
for
the
remainder
of
the
journey
to
which
he
very
readily
agreed
we
left
shamaki
on
the
of
november
for
the
city
of
derbent
which
is
called
in
the
language
of
the
country
the
caucassian
gates
or
the
iron
gates
this
city
is
under
the
dominion
of
and
stands
on
the
frontiers
of
tartary
on
our
journey
we
travelled
sometimes
over
plains
and
sometimes
on
mountains
and
were
tolerably
well
treated
by
the
turkish
inhabitants
with
whom
we
lodged
by
the
way
about
between
these
two
cities
we
came
to
a
large
village
where
we
found
great
abundance
of
excellent
fruits
particularly
admirable
apples
we
arrived
on
the
of
november
at
derbent
and
were
advised
to
pass
the
winter
in
that
place
as
it
was
necessary
in
our
way
to
russia
to
cross
the
desert
of
tartary
which
is
much
easier
in
the
spring
of
the
year
and
likewise
because
it
was
proper
for
us
to
cross
over
the
caspian
to
the
tartar
city
of
citracan
the
city
of
derbent
is
situated
on
the
shore
of
the
caspian
which
the
mardians
call
the
sea
of
bachaan
or
bacou
this
city
is
said
to
have
been
built
by
alexander
the
great
and
is
called
the
because
it
entirely
closes
up
the
only
passage
from
tartary
into
media
and
persia
by
means
of
a
deep
valley
reaching
from
circassia
derbent
is
fortified
with
a
thick
well
built
wall
reaching
from
the
castle
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
all
the
way
to
the
sea
but
not
above
a
sixth
part
of
the
space
within
the
walls
is
inhabited
all
that
end
nearest
the
sea
being
in
ruins
among
which
are
several
tombs
the
country
about
this
city
produces
abundance
of
all
kinds
of
fruits
among
which
are
plenty
of
grapes
from
which
the
inhabitants
make
wine
the
caspian
or
sea
of
hircania
which
has
no
communication
whatever
with
the
ocean
is
about
the
same
size
with
the
euxine
or
black
sea
and
is
very
deep
they
catch
in
this
sea
great
quantities
of
sturgeons
and
wolves
as
they
are
called
and
there
are
prodigious
quantities
of
dogs
or
seals
having
the
head
feet
and
tail
like
ordinary
dogs
the
only
other
remarkable
fish
is
of
a
round
form
about
a
yard
and
a
half
in
diameter
with
no
perceptible
head
or
other
member
from
which
the
natives
extract
a
great
quantity
of
oil
which
they
use
in
their
lamps
and
with
which
they
anoint
their
camels
the
inhabitants
of
this
country
who
are
all
mahometans
are
neither
cruel
nor
barbarous
and
used
us
exceedingly
well
having
once
asked
us
who
we
were
and
being
answered
that
we
were
christians
they
troubled
us
with
no
farther
inquiries
my
dress
at
this
time
consisted
of
coarse
and
much
worn
cloth
lined
with
lambs
skin
above
which
i
wore
a
leathern
robe
and
my
hat
was
of
skin
in
which
dress
i
frequently
went
to
the
market
to
purchase
flesh
and
other
provisions
which
i
carried
home
myself
on
one
of
these
occasions
a
person
eyed
me
attentively
and
turning
to
some
of
his
comrades
said
this
man
was
not
born
to
the
employment
of
carrying
meat
marcus
ruffus
who
happened
to
be
along
with
me
explained
what
the
man
had
said
and
i
was
astonished
at
being
recognized
in
so
shabby
a
dress
which
i
thought
must
have
proved
a
sufficient
concealment
but
in
truth
as
i
have
said
before
they
are
a
very
good
kind
of
people
during
my
residence
in
derbent
i
was
anxious
to
learn
some
certain
intelligence
respecting
the
state
of
affairs
at
the
court
of
for
which
purpose
i
sent
demetrius
de
seze
my
interpreter
with
letters
to
josaphat
barbaro
at
tauris
which
is
twenty
days
journey
from
derbent
he
returned
at
the
end
of
fifty
days
bringing
answers
from
barbaro
informing
me
that
the
king
still
remained
at
tauris
but
that
he
was
utterly
ignorant
of
his
affairs
spring
being
arrived
we
began
to
think
of
pursuing
our
journey
and
marcus
procured
a
boat
for
transporting
us
to
the
boats
which
are
used
in
this
country
are
drawn
up
on
the
shore
all
winter
as
the
sea
is
then
too
rough
for
their
use
they
are
sharp
at
both
ends
and
wide
in
the
middle
their
planks
being
fastened
with
and
their
bottoms
payed
over
with
pitch
and
as
the
natives
use
no
compasses
or
other
maritime
instruments
they
always
creep
along
the
coast
these
boats
which
are
very
crazy
and
dangerous
are
moved
forwards
by
means
of
oars
and
the
people
are
very
ignorant
of
navigation
though
they
believe
themselves
the
best
mariners
in
the
world
on
the
of
april
we
embarked
and
departed
from
derbent
being
persons
in
all
including
the
master
of
the
boat
and
the
crew
the
rest
of
the
passengers
were
merchants
carrying
rice
silk
and
silken
goods
to
where
they
proposed
to
sell
their
commodities
to
the
russians
and
tartars
or
to
barter
them
for
other
articles
having
coasted
along
during
three
days
with
a
favourable
wind
always
keeping
about
fifteen
miles
from
the
shore
the
wind
became
contrary
on
the
third
evening
and
increased
during
the
night
to
so
violent
a
tempest
that
we
expected
to
have
been
lost
although
we
had
all
reason
to
believe
our
bark
would
be
dashed
to
pieces
on
the
shore
we
made
every
effort
to
gain
the
land
and
fortunately
our
vessel
ran
into
a
kind
of
ditch
or
dock
between
sand
banks
very
near
the
beach
where
she
stuck
fast
impelled
by
the
united
force
of
the
winds
and
waves
and
of
our
oars
between
us
and
the
shore
there
was
a
pool
through
which
we
had
to
wade
carrying
our
baggage
on
our
shoulders
and
we
were
almost
perished
with
cold
owing
to
the
wind
and
our
being
drenched
with
water
yet
we
unanimously
agreed
to
refrain
from
making
a
fire
lest
that
circumstance
might
attract
the
notice
of
the
tartars
whom
we
feared
to
meet
with
at
day
light
we
noticed
traces
of
horses
having
been
on
the
spot
and
the
recent
fragments
of
a
ruined
skiff
from
which
we
were
led
to
conclude
that
some
persons
must
have
been
here
but
some
other
circumstances
gave
us
reason
to
believe
that
the
tartars
were
not
near
the
shore
we
remained
undisturbed
at
this
place
till
the
of
april
when
the
wind
and
weather
becoming
favourable
we
got
our
bark
from
the
creek
and
again
resumed
our
voyage
and
advanced
near
thirty
miles
the
same
day
towards
evening
the
wind
became
again
contrary
but
we
avoided
the
dangers
of
an
impending
storm
by
taking
refuge
amidst
some
reeds
among
which
our
mariners
hauled
the
boat
so
as
to
be
out
of
danger
from
the
waves
and
we
made
our
way
to
the
land
through
the
reeds
in
doing
which
we
were
much
fatigued
and
thoroughly
drenched
in
water
we
rested
here
all
that
night
and
the
day
following
which
was
easter
day
having
nothing
on
which
to
commemorate
that
festival
except
some
butter
and
a
few
eggs
which
we
fortunately
gathered
on
the
sandy
beach
the
mariners
and
passengers
were
often
inquisitive
to
know
who
i
was
and
pursuant
to
the
advice
of
marcus
ruffus
i
passed
myself
among
them
as
the
physician
and
servant
of
the
consort
of
the
grand
duke
of
moscovy
to
whom
i
was
going
a
short
time
after
this
one
of
our
mariners
happened
to
be
afflicted
by
a
large
boil
and
came
to
consult
me
in
my
assumed
character
and
as
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
discover
some
oil
in
our
bark
i
made
a
poultice
for
him
with
bread
and
flour
by
which
he
was
soon
cured
from
this
circumstance
they
actually
believed
me
to
be
a
physician
and
were
very
anxious
that
i
should
remain
among
them
but
marcus
drew
me
out
of
this
difficulty
by
saying
that
i
had
no
medicinal
preparations
with
me
but
would
soon
return
from
russia
with
a
proper
assortment
this
name
is
probably
corrupted
for
bagration
or
bagrathion
which
was
once
the
family
name
of
the
sovereigns
of
georgia
and
if
i
mistake
not
there
is
or
was
lately
a
prince
of
that
family
and
name
in
the
service
of
e
the
kingdom
of
media
in
the
text
is
obviously
meant
to
indicate
the
province
of
shirvan
on
the
west
of
the
e
perhaps
saray
on
the
eastern
branch
of
the
e
probably
astracan
is
here
e
section
vii
of
contarini
at
citracan
and
journey
from
thence
through
several
dangers
among
the
tartars
to
muscovy
along
with
some
on
the
of
april
we
put
again
to
sea
with
a
favourable
wind
and
coasting
along
a
series
of
reedy
islands
we
arrived
on
the
of
that
month
at
the
mouth
of
the
wolga
a
large
river
which
flows
from
russia
into
the
caspian
from
the
mouth
of
this
river
it
is
computed
to
be
miles
to
the
city
of
citracan
which
we
reached
on
the
near
this
city
there
are
excellent
from
which
all
the
neighbouring
provinces
are
supplied
with
salt
the
tartars
who
commanded
in
the
city
would
not
permit
us
to
enter
that
evening
so
that
we
had
to
pass
the
night
in
a
hut
without
the
walls
in
the
morning
three
faced
tartars
came
and
ordered
us
to
go
along
with
them
to
their
prince
they
treated
marcus
with
respect
saying
that
he
was
a
friend
of
their
sovereign
but
alleged
that
i
was
his
slave
as
they
consider
all
the
franks
or
christians
as
their
enemies
these
news
were
most
cruelly
mortifying
for
me
and
afflicted
me
severely
but
i
was
obliged
to
submit
in
spite
of
me
and
marcus
advised
me
to
allow
him
to
speak
for
me
forced
in
this
manner
to
return
disconsolate
to
my
hut
i
was
long
exposed
to
every
indignity
and
danger
to
my
great
mortification
and
distress
the
tartars
insisted
that
i
was
possessed
of
pearls
and
even
plundered
me
of
some
merchandize
i
had
purchased
in
derbent
intending
to
have
bartered
it
in
this
place
for
a
good
horse
to
carry
me
during
the
rest
of
my
journey
they
informed
me
afterwards
by
means
of
marcus
that
they
intended
to
sell
us
all
to
certain
people
whom
they
waited
for
and
who
were
to
go
into
muscovy
with
other
merchants
after
many
mortifications
and
distresses
it
was
resolved
to
hold
a
grand
consultation
concerning
us
at
a
large
village
named
about
two
miles
from
the
city
where
their
lord
resided
at
this
time
i
was
not
possessed
of
a
single
farthing
and
was
obliged
to
borrow
money
from
the
russian
and
tartar
merchants
at
a
high
interest
to
supply
our
urgent
necessities
for
which
marcus
became
my
bondsman
one
day
while
marcus
was
absent
the
khan
or
prince
of
the
tartars
broke
open
the
door
of
our
hut
and
endeavoured
to
compel
me
by
threats
to
deliver
up
the
pearls
which
he
believed
i
was
possessed
of
and
i
had
infinite
difficulty
to
escape
out
of
his
hands
and
to
persuade
him
not
to
put
me
to
death
the
tartars
used
often
to
come
to
our
hut
in
the
night
when
drunk
with
mead
demanding
with
loud
outcries
to
deliver
up
the
franks
to
them
and
the
bravest
among
us
were
terrified
at
the
dangerous
situation
in
which
we
were
among
these
savages
in
this
horrible
situation
we
remained
from
the
of
may
to
the
of
august
the
city
of
citracan
belongs
to
three
brothers
who
are
sons
to
the
brother
of
the
tartar
emperor
and
the
inhabitants
often
make
plundering
inroads
into
the
plains
of
and
along
the
borders
of
the
don
during
the
height
of
summer
they
travel
with
their
flocks
in
search
of
pasturage
to
the
northern
parts
of
russia
and
hardly
spend
above
a
month
every
year
in
citracan
that
city
which
stands
on
the
banks
of
the
wolga
is
by
no
means
large
its
houses
being
built
of
earth
it
is
surrounded
by
a
slight
wall
and
does
not
appear
to
have
had
any
better
buildings
for
a
long
time
past
it
is
said
to
have
had
a
very
considerable
fair
formerly
and
that
the
perfumes
and
spiceries
which
used
to
be
brought
to
venice
came
first
to
this
place
from
the
east
whence
they
were
carried
to
the
tanais
or
don
which
is
only
eight
days
journey
from
the
wolga
the
prince
of
citracan
whose
name
is
sends
every
year
an
ambassador
to
the
grand
duke
of
muscovy
on
purpose
to
extort
a
present
and
on
this
occasion
several
tartar
merchants
accompany
the
ambassador
carrying
silk
silken
vestments
and
other
articles
of
trade
which
they
barter
for
saddles
furs
and
other
things
which
are
in
request
among
their
countrymen
the
only
way
of
travelling
into
russia
from
this
place
is
through
extensive
deserts
on
which
account
travellers
have
to
go
in
large
bands
or
caravans
for
mutual
security
and
to
carry
provisions
for
the
journey
the
tartars
care
little
for
the
latter
precaution
as
they
have
always
plenty
of
spare
horses
and
kill
one
when
needed
as
they
live
entirely
on
flesh
and
milk
without
caring
for
any
other
food
they
use
no
bread
and
only
a
few
of
their
merchants
who
have
been
in
russia
know
any
thing
of
this
article
previous
to
the
commencement
of
our
journey
we
provided
provisions
for
the
journey
as
well
as
we
could
in
this
view
we
procured
some
rice
with
much
difficulty
which
boiled
in
milk
and
then
dried
in
the
sun
makes
when
afterwards
boiled
in
water
an
excellent
and
nourishing
food
we
had
likewise
some
onions
a
small
quantity
of
biscuit
and
some
other
trifles
and
i
bought
during
the
journey
the
salted
tail
of
a
sheep
the
usual
road
from
citracan
to
russia
lay
between
two
branches
of
the
wolga
but
the
roads
were
then
exceedingly
dangerous
as
the
tartar
emperor
was
then
at
war
with
his
nephew
who
pretended
a
right
to
the
throne
as
his
father
had
once
been
emperor
on
this
account
it
was
proposed
to
pass
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
to
travel
towards
the
straits
between
the
don
and
the
wolga
which
are
about
five
days
journey
from
citracan
after
which
it
was
presumed
we
should
be
out
of
danger
our
baggage
was
accordingly
carried
across
the
river
on
rafts
and
marcus
desired
me
to
keep
always
along
with
him
and
the
tartar
ambassador
named
i
and
my
interpreter
accordingly
set
out
about
along
with
the
ambassador
to
go
to
the
place
where
the
boats
waited
for
us
which
was
about
twelve
miles
from
the
city
our
other
companions
having
already
gone
there
on
our
arrival
about
sunset
while
i
prepared
to
go
into
one
of
the
boats
on
purpose
to
cross
the
river
marcus
seemed
suddenly
struck
with
an
extraordinary
panic
and
commanded
the
interpreter
and
me
to
take
to
flight
instantly
to
avoid
inevitable
danger
we
mounted
therefore
immediately
having
likewise
a
russian
woman
along
with
us
and
a
tartar
guide
of
a
most
horrible
aspect
and
set
out
at
full
speed
in
this
manner
we
followed
our
guide
the
whole
of
that
night
and
part
of
the
next
day
without
being
ever
allowed
to
stop
i
frequently
asked
our
guide
by
means
of
my
interpreter
what
was
the
reason
of
all
this
and
where
he
proposed
to
carry
me
at
length
he
explained
the
cause
of
marcus
having
made
us
set
off
with
such
precipitation
as
the
khan
had
sent
an
order
to
examine
all
the
boats
and
he
was
apprehensive
they
would
have
detained
me
as
a
slave
if
i
had
been
found
about
of
the
of
august
we
arrived
at
the
banks
of
the
river
and
our
tartar
guide
endeavoured
to
find
a
boat
in
which
to
carry
us
into
an
island
in
which
the
flocks
of
auchioli
were
kept
but
not
finding
one
he
cut
down
some
branches
which
he
tied
together
so
as
to
form
a
raft
on
this
he
placed
the
saddles
of
our
horses
and
tying
this
raft
to
his
horses
tail
he
mounted
the
horse
on
which
he
swam
across
the
river
to
the
island
which
lay
a
from
the
shore
he
then
came
back
with
the
raft
on
which
he
carried
over
the
russian
woman
after
which
he
came
back
for
me
and
i
stripped
myself
naked
before
trusting
myself
to
the
crazy
raft
that
i
might
be
in
readiness
to
save
myself
by
swimming
in
case
of
any
misfortune
he
afterwards
returned
for
our
horses
and
my
interpreter
swam
across
the
passage
of
the
river
being
thus
happily
effected
the
tartar
carried
us
to
a
wretched
hovel
covered
by
a
miserable
woollen
cloth
where
he
gave
us
some
sour
milk
which
we
found
very
refreshing
as
we
had
been
long
without
food
and
were
much
fatigued
immediately
on
our
arrival
in
the
island
being
known
several
tartars
left
their
flocks
to
come
and
see
us
seeming
infinitely
surprized
and
much
gratified
by
the
sight
as
we
were
probably
the
first
christians
who
had
ever
been
on
the
island
being
exceedingly
fatigued
and
distressed
in
mind
i
did
not
care
to
speak
with
them
yet
our
tartar
guide
treated
me
with
much
kindness
and
made
me
as
good
cheer
as
he
was
able
next
day
being
the
eve
of
the
festival
of
the
virgin
he
killed
a
fat
lamb
to
entertain
me
part
of
which
he
roasted
and
part
was
boiled
and
though
contrary
to
the
rules
of
our
religion
to
eat
meat
on
that
day
i
made
a
hearty
meal
notwithstanding
that
every
thing
was
disgustingly
dirty
we
had
likewise
sour
milk
to
drink
and
the
tartars
drank
mares
milk
of
which
they
are
very
fond
but
i
would
not
drink
this
though
i
could
easily
perceive
my
dislike
did
not
please
the
tartars
i
remained
here
two
days
and
at
last
on
the
of
august
marcus
and
the
rest
made
their
appearance
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
sent
a
boat
for
me
in
which
were
two
of
his
servants
a
russian
and
a
tartar
stephen
testa
and
john
ungaret
my
two
attendants
were
very
much
rejoiced
at
seeing
me
again
as
they
believed
me
entirely
lost
and
we
rested
two
days
at
this
place
before
entering
upon
the
desert
marcus
had
been
so
attentive
as
to
provide
a
horse
for
me
of
which
i
stood
in
great
need
in
this
caravan
which
was
under
the
command
of
the
tartar
ambassador
there
were
about
three
hundred
persons
russians
and
tartars
who
carried
with
them
above
two
hundred
horses
partly
intended
to
serve
as
food
by
the
way
and
partly
for
sale
in
russia
we
arrived
in
good
order
at
night
on
the
banks
of
the
river
and
we
rested
every
day
at
noon
during
the
fifteen
days
of
our
journey
as
we
were
now
considered
to
be
out
of
danger
from
any
attack
by
the
tartars
i
do
not
recollect
the
name
of
the
emperor
of
the
tartars
who
inhabit
this
part
of
the
country
between
the
wolga
and
the
tanais
this
nation
has
no
fixed
place
of
abode
but
shift
their
encampments
from
place
to
place
wherever
they
can
find
pasture
and
water
for
their
cattle
on
which
they
have
their
whole
dependence
as
they
subsist
entirely
on
flesh
and
milk
they
have
cows
heifers
and
sheep
of
admirable
beauty
the
flesh
of
which
is
excellent
as
they
feed
on
fine
pastures
but
these
people
prefer
mares
milk
to
every
other
delicacy
though
i
have
not
been
in
the
country
of
these
tartars
i
have
been
informed
that
it
is
flat
and
agreeable
having
neither
hill
nor
mountain
but
the
inhabitants
addict
themselves
excessively
to
robbery
and
plunder
as
their
sole
occupation
and
continually
infest
the
borders
of
russia
and
circassia
by
predatory
incursions
their
horses
are
very
wild
and
unmanageable
and
are
never
shod
we
were
told
that
there
is
another
tribe
of
tartars
beyond
the
wolga
named
wild
tartars
who
allow
their
hair
to
grow
extremely
long
in
the
middle
of
winter
they
often
make
inroads
to
the
very
skirts
of
the
city
of
citracan
whence
they
carry
off
cattle
but
do
no
other
damage
these
people
like
all
the
tartars
shift
their
encampments
in
search
of
pasturage
and
water
after
travelling
for
fifteen
days
along
the
eastern
bank
of
the
wolga
we
came
to
a
small
forest
where
the
tartars
and
russians
of
the
caravan
cut
down
trees
to
construct
rafts
for
crossing
the
river
while
they
were
at
this
work
we
discovered
a
small
bark
which
was
by
no
means
in
good
repair
by
means
of
which
our
company
proposed
to
convey
our
baggage
across
marcus
crossed
over
with
a
part
of
our
baggage
leaving
me
in
charge
of
the
rest
and
sent
back
the
boat
when
he
was
landed
in
my
trip
with
the
remainder
of
our
baggage
the
boat
began
to
leak
when
we
were
about
half
way
over
the
breadth
of
the
river
at
this
place
being
about
two
miles
stephen
and
two
russians
accompanied
me
in
the
boat
leaving
demetrius
my
interpreter
and
john
ungar
in
charge
of
the
horses
we
had
much
ado
to
bale
out
the
water
but
by
the
blessing
of
god
we
got
over
in
safety
after
our
baggage
was
landed
the
russians
put
off
to
go
back
for
the
rest
of
our
people
and
the
horses
but
the
boat
fell
to
pieces
this
necessarily
delayed
our
other
servants
and
the
horses
from
getting
over
till
next
day
during
which
interval
they
were
badly
off
as
all
our
provisions
were
on
our
side
it
was
fortunate
that
i
now
examined
the
state
of
our
provisions
which
i
found
diminished
much
beyond
expectation
so
that
we
were
under
the
necessity
of
abridging
our
allowance
for
the
remainder
of
the
journey
that
we
might
not
run
short
altogether
our
principal
food
consisted
of
millet
with
garlic
and
onions
and
some
sour
milk
and
we
found
some
wild
apples
at
this
place
which
we
roasted
in
the
course
of
two
days
the
whole
baggage
of
the
caravan
was
transported
to
the
western
side
of
the
river
by
means
of
seven
rafts
drawn
by
horses
and
directed
by
the
tartars
the
horses
swimming
and
having
the
rafts
tied
to
their
tails
the
sight
of
this
was
very
amusing
but
seemed
very
dangerous
to
those
who
were
employed
after
resting
some
time
we
quitted
the
banks
of
the
river
and
resumed
our
journey
this
river
wolga
is
certainly
the
largest
and
deepest
river
in
the
world
being
as
well
as
i
could
judge
two
miles
broad
and
has
very
high
banks
called
citrarchan
in
the
former
section
but
certainly
what
we
now
call
astracan
then
the
capital
of
a
tartar
principality
which
now
forms
one
of
the
provinces
of
the
vast
russian
e
these
are
large
shallow
ponds
in
which
sea
water
is
exposed
to
evaporation
to
procure

in
the
original
this
person
is
called
the
cham
of
the
the
tartar
government
of
astracan
belonged
to
one
of
the
mongal
tribes
of
kipschak
but
the
word
used
in
the
original
may
have
been
a
local
term
not
now
e
perhaps
the
kingdom
or
province
of
cazan
higher
up
the
e
contarini
has
forgot
to
give
us
any
account
in
what
manner
he
procured
leave
to
quit
astracan
perhaps
by
means
of
marcus
he
was
permitted
to
pass
for
one
of
his
e
it
may
be
necessary
to
remark
that
the
tails
of
a
peculiar
species
of
sheep
platyurus
or
the
sheep
common
among
the
tartars
and
other
parts
of
the
world
are
said
sometimes
to

probably
an
error

viii
after
crossing
european
sarmatia
arrives
at
moscow
the
capital
of
white
russia
and
is
presented
to
the
grand
after
recommending
ourselves
to
the
protection
of
god
we
continued
our
journey
through
immense
and
terrible
deserts
sometimes
towards
the
north
and
sometimes
westerly
always
resting
at
noon
and
taking
up
our
quarters
for
the
night
on
the
bare
ground
without
any
protection
against
the
weather
to
prevent
us
from
being
surprized
in
the
night
by
the
wandering
tartars
outguards
were
placed
every
night
in
three
directions
around
our
during
the
greater
part
of
this
long
and
dreary
journey
we
were
very
ill
off
for
water
both
for
ourselves
and
our
cattle
and
we
never
saw
any
wild
animals
one
day
we
saw
about
forty
horses
which
we
were
told
had
escaped
from
a
caravan
of
merchants
the
year
before
we
fell
in
one
day
with
a
small
horde
of
tartars
having
twenty
waggons
but
i
was
not
able
to
learn
where
they
were
going
as
our
provisions
decreased
rapidly
we
were
forced
to
use
the
remainder
very
sparingly
and
were
consequently
reduced
to
a
very
short
allowance
on
the
of
september
we
entered
russia
and
discovered
a
few
huts
in
the
middle
of
a
wood
on
the
inhabitants
learning
that
marcus
their
countryman
was
in
our
caravan
they
came
to
see
him
that
he
might
protect
them
from
the
tartars
and
brought
him
a
present
of
honey
and
wax
a
part
of
which
he
gave
to
us
this
was
a
most
providential
supply
as
we
were
so
much
reduced
by
fatigue
and
spare
diet
that
we
were
hardly
able
to
sit
on
horseback
the
first
city
we
came
to
in
this
country
was
the
prince
of
which
place
had
married
a
sister
of
the
grand
duke
of
russia
the
castle
and
all
the
houses
of
this
city
are
built
of
wood
we
here
procured
bread
and
meat
and
mead
in
abundance
to
our
great
comfort
and
satisfaction
the
next
city
we
came
to
was
passing
a
very
large
bridge
over
the
which
flows
into
the
wolga
at
this
place
marcus
quitted
the
caravan
which
travelled
too
slowly
in
his
opinion
and
pushed
on
for
moscow
where
we
arrived
on
the
of
september
after
a
journey
of
days
through
the
desert
from
the
of
august
on
which
day
we
left
citracan
in
a
great
part
of
this
journey
we
found
no
wood
and
were
forced
to
cook
our
victuals
with
fires
made
of
dried
cow
dung
we
returned
thanks
to
god
on
our
arrival
for
our
preservation
through
so
many
and
great
dangers
on
our
arrival
marcus
procured
a
dwelling
for
us
consisting
of
a
small
room
and
some
chambers
with
stabling
for
our
horses
though
small
and
mean
i
felt
as
if
lodged
in
a
palace
when
i
compared
my
present
state
of
tranquil
security
with
the
dangers
and
inconveniences
i
had
been
so
long
subjected
to
marcus
made
me
a
visit
two
days
afterwards
and
supplied
me
with
some
necessaries
exhorting
me
as
on
the
part
of
his
sovereign
to
keep
a
good
heart
i
returned
his
visit
next
day
and
being
very
desirous
to
return
home
to
venice
i
requested
him
to
introduce
me
to
the
grand
duke
which
he
promised
to
do
as
soon
as
possible
and
i
soon
afterwards
was
desired
to
go
to
court
immediately
on
my
getting
there
i
was
conducted
to
an
audience
on
which
i
made
my
obeisance
in
due
form
to
the
grand
duke
to
whom
i
returned
thanks
for
all
the
attentions
i
had
received
from
his
ambassador
marcus
in
the
course
of
my
journey
by
whose
assistance
and
advice
i
had
escaped
a
thousand
dangers
assuring
his
highness
that
i
attributed
these
marks
of
kindness
as
done
to
the
republic
of
venice
whose
ambassador
i
was
and
that
the
republic
would
unquestionably
evince
a
due
sense
of
the
obligations
to
which
i
owed
my
life
and
safety
the
grand
duke
interrupted
my
harangue
by
complaining
with
much
emotion
of
the
conduct
of
of
treviso
and
said
a
great
deal
on
this
subject
which
is
not
proper
for
me
to
report
after
a
conversation
of
some
length
in
which
i
spoke
to
his
highness
about
my
departure
he
closed
my
audience
postponing
his
answers
to
my
requests
to
a
future
opportunity
the
grand
duke
was
very
shortly
to
quit
moscow
on
purpose
to
visit
several
parts
of
his
dominions
and
particularly
the
tartar
frontier
where
one
of
his
officers
was
stationed
with
the
command
of
horse
to
repress
the
incursions
of
robbers
on
that
side
i
therefore
endeavoured
to
procure
an
answer
about
my
departure
and
solicited
a
second
audience
for
that
purpose
on
this
occasion
i
was
very
politely
received
by
the
grand
duke
accompanied
by
three
of
his
principal
barons
at
first
they
expatiated
at
some
length
on
the
subject
of
john
baptista
formerly
mentioned
but
at
length
i
received
liberty
to
remain
or
to
depart
as
i
thought
proper
they
dismissed
me
with
this
vague
answer
and
the
grand
duke
set
out
from
moscow
soon
afterwards
i
owed
a
great
deal
of
money
to
marcus
which
he
had
expended
for
me
and
my
people
as
he
had
defrayed
the
whole
expences
of
our
journey
and
had
supplied
me
with
many
things
of
which
i
stood
in
need
i
requested
permission
from
him
to
go
away
giving
him
the
most
solemn
assurance
that
i
would
transmit
full
payment
to
him
immediately
after
my
arrival
at
venice
but
he
declared
this
was
not
in
his
power
as
he
was
under
the
necessity
of
repaying
the
tartarian
and
russian
merchants
who
had
advanced
all
these
things
for
us
and
to
whom
he
had
become
security
for
payment
finding
every
application
to
the
duke
and
marcus
on
this
subject
ineffectual
as
i
could
not
procure
the
necessary
funds
for
my
journey
from
either
i
was
under
the
necessity
of
sending
stephen
testa
to
venice
to
solicit
a
remittance
from
our
illustrious
senate
by
which
i
might
be
enabled
to
pay
my
debts
stephen
left
moscow
on
the
of
october
accompanied
by
one
who
knew
the
country
i
became
acquainted
at
moscow
with
one
triphon
a
goldsmith
a
native
of
ascravia
or
cathara
who
was
employed
in
making
several
articles
of
silver
plate
for
the
grand
duke
i
likewise
formed
acquaintance
with
a
very
ingenious
architect
of
bologna
named
aristotle
who
was
building
a
new
church
in
the
as
the
house
in
which
i
lodged
was
small
and
disagreeable
i
went
to
live
with
this
person
by
the
advice
of
marcus
but
i
was
soon
after
obliged
to
change
my
quarters
by
order
from
court
to
a
house
near
the
castle
in
which
i
remained
for
the
rest
of
my
stay
at
moscow
this
city
which
is
the
capital
of
the
russian
dominions
and
the
residence
of
the
grand
duke
or
sovereign
is
built
on
a
small
elevation
on
the
banks
of
the
mosqua
over
which
there
are
several
bridges
the
castle
and
all
the
houses
of
the
city
being
built
of
wood
which
is
procured
from
several
thick
forests
near
the
place
the
soil
of
this
country
is
fertile
and
produces
abundance
of
corn
of
all
kinds
which
sell
here
much
cheaper
than
with
us
the
country
abounds
in
cattle
and
swine
and
with
incredible
numbers
of
poultry
ducks
geese
and
hares
but
they
have
no
venison
either
because
there
are
no
deer
or
because
the
natives
are
ignorant
of
the
art
of
taking
them
but
they
have
no
vines
and
their
only
fruits
are
cucumbers
wild
apples
and
nuts
the
country
is
extremely
cold
and
the
inhabitants
are
under
the
necessity
of
living
for
nine
months
of
the
year
in
stoves
they
provide
during
winter
for
their
living
in
summer
when
the
whole
country
is
enveloped
in
frost
and
snow
they
use
sledges
drawn
by
horses
which
are
very
convenient
and
useful
for
travelling
and
are
even
used
in
summer
on
account
of
the
miry
bad
roads
which
are
exceedingly
difficult
and
unpleasant
the
river
ordinarily
freezes
over
about
the
end
of
october
when
the
merchants
erect
booths
on
the
ice
in
which
they
expose
their
wares
of
all
kinds
for
sale
as
in
a
fair
or
market
and
they
here
sell
great
numbers
of
cattle
and
swine
and
great
quantities
of
corn
timber
and
all
other
necessaries
of
life
every
thing
being
procurable
in
great
abundance
all
the
winter
about
the
end
of
november
they
kill
all
the
cattle
sheep
and
other
animals
that
are
required
for
winter
provision
and
expose
them
for
sale
on
the
river
in
a
frozen
state
and
the
rigour
of
the
season
preserves
these
provisions
for
two
or
three
months
without
any
risk
of
spoiling
fish
poultry
and
all
other
articles
of
food
are
kept
in
the
same
manner
the
horses
run
with
great
ease
and
swiftness
on
the
ice
yet
they
sometimes
fell
and
break
their
necks
both
men
and
women
of
this
country
have
very
good
faces
but
their
manners
are
exceedingly
bad
the
russian
church
is
ruled
over
by
a
patriarch
whose
election
or
appointment
is
dependent
on
the
grand
duke
and
who
does
not
acknowledge
subjection
to
the
roman
pontiff
and
they
hold
all
sectaries
in
abhorrence
as
people
doomed
to
perdition
the
natives
are
much
addicted
to
drunkenness
and
he
who
excels
in
drinking
is
much
esteemed
among
them
they
have
no
wine
as
i
have
said
before
instead
of
which
they
drink
mead
made
of
honey
and
water
which
is
very
pleasant
when
sufficiently
kept
it
is
not
allowed
to
every
one
to
make
this
liquor
for
which
purpose
a
license
or
permission
must
be
had
from
the
grand
duke
for
if
every
person
had
liberty
to
make
mead
they
would
drink
perpetually
like
so
many
beasts
and
would
kill
one
another
from
morning
till
noon
they
are
employed
in
the
occupied
in
their
various
businesses
and
employments
after
which
they
adjourn
to
the
taverns
in
which
they
spend
all
the
rest
of
the
day
every
winter
great
numbers
of
merchants
come
to
moscow
from
germany
and
poland
who
purchase
furs
of
all
kinds
which
are
indeed
exceedingly
beautiful
among
these
furs
are
the
skins
of
foxes
wolves
martins
sables
ermines
and
many
others
from
scythia
and
the
alpine
regions
many
days
journey
to
the
north
of
moscow
many
of
these
are
likewise
carried
for
sale
to
novogorod
a
city
towards
the
frontiers
of
germany
eight
days
journey
west
from
moscow
the
government
of
that
city
is
democratic
and
only
pays
a
stipulated
yearly
tribute
to
the
grand
duke
the
country
subject
to
the
grand
duke
of
russia
is
of
vast
extent
and
an
infinite
number
of
people
are
subject
to
his
dominions
but
they
are
by
no
means
warlike
this
empire
extends
from
the
north
towards
the
west
to
that
part
of
germany
which
is
under
the
dominion
of
the
king
of
poland
and
some
reckon
among
his
subjects
a
wandering
nation
of
idolaters
who
acknowledge
no
sovereign
not
even
submitting
to
the
authority
of
the
grand
duke
but
when
it
suits
their
own
convenience
these
wandering
tribes
are
said
to
worship
during
the
day
whatever
first
presents
itself
to
their
view
on
going
out
in
the
morning
many
other
ridiculous
things
are
reported
of
them
which
i
do
not
repeat
as
i
have
not
seen
them
and
can
hardly
give
credit
to
the
reports
the
grand
duke
appeared
to
be
about
years
of
age
was
handsomely
made
and
had
very
dignified
manners
and
an
air
quite
royal
his
mother
was
still
alive
and
he
had
two
brothers
by
a
former
wife
he
had
two
sons
who
did
not
agree
with
despina
the
reigning
grand
duchess
and
were
not
therefore
on
very
friendly
terms
with
their
father
despina
his
second
wife
had
brought
him
two
daughters
and
was
said
to
be
again
with
child
the
grand
duke
returned
to
moscow
from
his
journey
to
the
frontiers
about
the
end
of
december
and
as
i
could
not
reconcile
myself
to
the
manners
and
mode
of
life
of
the
russians
i
became
exceedingly
impatient
to
leave
the
country
and
could
not
persuade
myself
to
stay
for
the
return
of
stephen
from
venice
with
money
for
this
reason
i
made
interest
with
one
of
the
lords
of
the
court
to
prevail
on
the
grand
duke
to
supply
me
with
money
and
to
give
me
leave
to
depart
a
few
days
afterwards
the
grand
duke
sent
for
me
to
court
and
invited
me
to
dinner
when
he
agreed
from
respect
to
the
republic
to
lend
me
as
much
money
as
was
necessary
to
clear
all
my
debts
to
the
tartarian
and
russian
merchants
and
to
enable
me
to
return
to
venice
the
dinner
was
quite
magnificent
consisting
of
every
delicacy
and
of
abundance
of
exquisitely
dressed
dishes
when
the
repast
was
finished
i
retired
according
to
custom
some
days
afterwards
i
was
again
invited
to
court
and
the
grand
duke
gave
orders
his
treasurer
to
give
me
all
the
money
necessary
for
paying
my
debts
besides
which
he
presented
me
with
ducats
and
a
magnificent
dress
of
scythian
squirrels
skins
to
wear
in
his
presence
when
i
came
to
court
before
returning
to
my
quarters
he
ordered
me
to
be
presented
to
the
grand
duchess
who
received
me
very
graciously
and
desired
me
to
offer
her
respectful
salutations
to
our
illustrious
republic
which
i
promised
to
do
this
journey
appears
to
have
been
through
the
country
on
the
west
of
the
wolga
which
they
probably
passed
about
czariein
through
the
provinces
of
saratov
woronez
and
penza
avoiding
the
ilafla
to
rezan
or
e
rezan
or
riazan
in
the
province
of
that
name
on
the
oka
in
a
considerable
part
of
the
track
of
this
journey
there
are
now
towns
and
villages
but
the
whole
of
this
frontier
of
european
russia
appears
to
have
been
then
entirely
waste
and
pervaded
by
the
wandering
tartars
we
are
quite
in
the
dark
respecting
the
particulars
of
the
route
from
astracan
to
rezan
it
was
certainty
on
the
east
of
the
wolga
at
the
first
to
avoid
the
tartars
which
occupied
the
country
between
the
caspian
and
euxine
the
passage
of
that
vast
river
may
have
been
at
czariein
at
its
great
elbow
in
lat
or
about
saratov
in
neither
of
which
towns
seem
to
have
then
existed
from
thence
they
would
probably
proceed
to
avoid
the
larger
rivers
between
where
penza
and
tchenbar
now
stand
and
by
the
scite
of
morbansk
towards
e
in
the
original
this
large
bridge
is
said
to
have
been
at
kolomna
which
is
on
the
river
mosqua
of
very
inferior
magnitude
and
flows
into
the
oka
which
most
probably
is
the
monstrus
of
the
e
in
the
original
the
commander
of
this
body
of
cavalry
is
said
to
have
been
a
tartarian
general
the
word
leopolitain
may
possibly
be
a
corruption
for
neopolitan
or
a
native
of
naples
perhaps
it
may
refer
to
leopol
in
that
part
of
poland
now
belonging
to
austria
and
called
e
such
is
the
expression
in
the
original
which
ought
perhaps
to
be
reversed
yet
contarini
possibly
meant
to
say
that
the
inhabitants
of
moscow
laid
up
a
sufficient
stock
of
money
from
the
profits
of
their
long
winter
labours
for
their
subsistence
during
summer
when
by
the
absence
of
the
court
they
had
little
e
there
are
two
cities
named
novogrod
or
novgorod
in
russia
nearly
at
equal
distances
from
moscow
one
to
the
northwest
and
the
other
to
the
southwest
the
latter
of
which
named
novgorod
sieverskov
is
probably
meant
in
the
text
and
which
ought
rather
to
have
been
described
as
towards
the
frontiers
of
poland
the
other
novgorod
did
not
then
belong
to
the
russian
e
the
geographical
ideas
of
contarini
are
very
vague
and
superficial
this
is
perhaps
the
only
instance
wherein
poland
a
portion
of
european
sarmatia
is
considered
as
belonging
geographically
to

the

sovereign
of

leaves
moscow
and
having
passed
through
lithuania
poland
and
germany
arrives
at
on
the
day
before
that
which
i
had
fixed
for
my
departure
i
was
invited
to
dine
at
court
before
dinner
i
was
taken
into
one
of
the
halls
of
the
palace
where
i
found
the
grand
duke
accompanied
by
marcus
and
a
secretary
his
highness
addressed
me
very
graciously
and
desired
me
to
report
all
the
marks
of
esteem
and
friendship
he
had
shewn
me
from
respect
to
our
illustrious
republic
and
offered
me
every
thing
i
could
desire
and
which
lay
in
his
power
to
grant
while
speaking
i
drew
back
from
respect
but
as
i
retired
he
always
advanced
i
answered
every
thing
to
his
satisfaction
and
humbly
offered
my
most
grateful
thanks
for
all
his
benevolence
to
me
he
treated
me
with
the
utmost
politeness
and
familiarity
and
even
condescended
to
shew
me
some
robes
of
gold
tissue
magnificently
lined
with
scythian
sables
after
which
we
went
to
dinner
the
repast
was
extraordinarily
magnificent
at
which
several
of
the
barons
and
great
officers
of
state
assisted
when
we
rose
from
table
the
grand
duke
called
me
to
him
and
gave
me
my
audience
of
leave
in
the
most
gracious
terms
speaking
so
loud
as
to
be
heard
by
all
the
company
and
expressing
his
high
esteem
for
the
illustrious
republic
of
venice
after
this
by
his
order
a
silver
cup
was
brought
to
me
filled
with
mead
of
which
he
made
me
a
present
as
a
mark
of
high
regard
with
which
he
honours
ambassadors
and
other
persons
to
whom
he
shews
favour
this
present
was
to
me
a
matter
of
very
serious
consideration
as
the
etiquette
required
me
to
empty
its
contents
and
the
cup
was
very
large
when
i
had
drained
about
a
quarter
of
the
liquor
knowing
the
sobriety
of
the
italians
and
perceiving
that
i
was
much
difficulted
the
grand
duke
had
the
goodness
to
order
the
remainder
to
be
emptied
and
the
goblet
given
to
me
having
thanked
the
grand
duke
in
as
respectful
terms
as
i
was
able
i
took
my
leave
and
retired
accompanied
by
several
barons
and
other
persons
of
rank
every
thing
was
now
in
readiness
for
my
departure
but
marcus
would
by
no
means
hear
of
my
leaving
moscow
without
taking
a
dinner
with
him
and
accordingly
gave
me
a
magnificent
entertainment
louis
the
patriarch
of
antioch
of
whom
i
have
before
made
mention
came
about
this
time
to
moscow
and
was
detained
there
by
order
of
the
grand
duke
but
i
made
interest
through
marcus
for
his
release
which
i
obtained
and
he
was
to
have
travelled
along
with
me
but
as
he
delayed
too
long
i
set
off
without
him
at
length
on
the
january
we
set
out
from
moscow
in
sledges
made
like
small
huts
each
drawn
by
a
horse
and
guided
by
a
driver
in
these
sledges
we
carried
our
baggage
and
provisions
along
with
us
and
in
them
journeys
of
great
length
may
be
made
in
a
wonderfully
short
time
by
order
of
the
grand
duke
i
had
a
guide
appointed
to
conduct
me
on
the
right
road
and
this
was
continued
from
place
to
place
all
through
his
dominions
we
slept
the
first
night
in
a
small
village
where
we
found
our
lodgings
exceedingly
cold
but
that
was
the
smallest
of
our
inconveniencies
and
on
this
account
i
hastened
our
journey
as
much
as
possible
on
the
of
january
we
arrived
at
and
a
few
days
afterwards
at
smolensk
on
the
frontiers
of
lithuania
in
the
dominions
of
casimir
king
of
poland
from
smolensk
till
we
arrived
at
a
city
of
lithuania
we
travelled
continually
in
a
plain
interspersed
with
some
hills
the
whole
country
being
covered
with
wood
and
our
only
lodgings
were
in
miserable
hovels
dining
always
about
noon
wherever
we
could
meet
with
a
fire
which
had
been
left
burning
by
travellers
who
had
passed
before
us
we
had
generally
to
break
the
ice
to
procure
water
for
our
horses
we
lighted
fires
to
warm
ourselves
and
our
sledges
served
us
instead
of
beds
as
without
them
we
must
have
slept
on
the
ground
we
went
with
such
expedition
over
the
frozen
snow
that
we
were
assured
we
had
travelled
miles
in
three
days
and
two
nights
casimir
king
of
poland
who
then
resided
at
immediately
on
learning
my
arrival
sent
two
of
his
gentlemen
to
compliment
me
in
his
name
and
to
congratulate
me
on
my
safe
return
they
likewise
invited
me
to
dine
with
his
majesty
on
the
following
day
which
was
the
of
february
and
presented
me
on
the
part
of
the
king
with
a
robe
of
purple
damask
lined
with
scythian
furs
in
which
i
dressed
myself
to
go
to
court
on
this
occasion
i
went
in
a
coach
and
six
accompanied
by
four
noblemen
and
several
other
persons
the
king
himself
did
me
the
honour
to
receive
me
and
conducted
me
into
a
magnificent
apartment
where
he
introduced
me
to
two
of
his
sons
in
presence
of
many
nobles
knights
and
gentlemen
of
the
court
a
chair
was
placed
for
me
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
when
i
offered
to
kneel
on
one
knee
while
addressing
the
king
his
majesty
had
the
goodness
to
insist
that
i
should
sit
down
in
his
presence
which
i
did
after
some
hesitation
i
then
gave
a
recital
of
all
that
had
occurred
in
my
travels
with
some
account
of
the
dominions
of
and
of
the
number
of
his
forces
and
of
the
empire
and
manners
of
the
tartars
the
king
and
his
courtiers
listened
to
me
with
much
attention
during
my
whole
speech
which
lasted
more
than
half
an
hour
i
then
thanked
his
majesty
for
the
present
he
had
made
me
and
for
all
his
kindnesses
to
me
attributing
his
attentions
to
the
esteem
he
entertained
for
our
illustrious
republic
his
majesty
was
pleased
by
means
of
an
interpreter
to
express
great
satisfaction
at
my
safe
arrival
as
he
hardly
expected
i
should
ever
have
been
able
to
return
and
that
he
was
much
pleased
with
the
information
i
had
given
him
respecting
hassan
and
the
tartars
which
he
believed
to
be
more
authentic
than
any
he
had
received
before
after
some
other
discourse
i
was
conducted
to
the
hall
where
the
dinner
was
served
soon
after
which
his
majesty
came
into
the
hall
with
his
two
sons
preceded
by
several
trumpets
the
king
sat
down
at
the
head
of
the
table
having
his
two
sons
on
his
right
hand
the
primate
of
the
kingdom
sat
next
on
his
majestys
left
and
i
was
placed
next
the
bishop
the
remainder
of
the
table
was
occupied
by
about
forty
of
the
nobles
each
service
was
ushered
in
with
the
sound
of
trumpets
and
all
the
meats
were
served
on
large
silver
dishes
after
dinner
which
lasted
two
hours
i
rose
to
depart
and
asked
the
king
if
he
had
any
farther
orders
to
honour
me
with
when
he
was
pleased
to
say
very
graciously
that
he
charged
me
to
assure
the
senate
that
his
most
anxious
desire
was
to
cultivate
perpetual
friendship
and
with
our
illustrious
republic
and
he
was
pleased
to
make
his
sons
express
the
same
friendly
wishes
having
respectfully
taken
leave
of
the
king
i
was
conducted
back
to
my
lodgings
by
several
of
the
courtiers
being
supplied
with
a
guide
i
departed
from
troki
on
the
of
february
and
in
nine
days
passing
through
the
city
of
i
arrived
at
warsaw
on
the
of
march
the
country
of
poland
appeared
very
pleasant
and
abundant
in
every
thing
except
fruit
during
our
journey
we
saw
many
villages
and
castles
and
were
well
received
everywhere
but
we
found
no
considerable
city
after
remaining
four
days
in
warsaw
where
i
purchased
horses
for
the
rest
of
our
journey
we
set
out
from
that
place
on
the
of
march
and
came
that
day
to
a
town
call
where
we
began
to
travel
with
less
assurance
of
safety
as
this
place
is
on
the
frontiers
towards
germany
on
the
i
arrived
at
frankfort
on
the
oder
from
which
place
we
found
more
commodious
lodgings
in
traversing
germany
than
we
had
been
accustomed
to
for
a
long
time
while
passing
the
city
of
on
the
of
march
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
with
stephen
testa
whom
i
had
sent
from
moscow
to
venice
for
money
i
was
quite
delighted
at
this
meeting
as
from
him
i
received
good
accounts
from
home
we
now
entered
the
city
of
where
we
rested
two
days
on
the
we
reached
nurenburgh
where
we
remained
four
days
from
whence
we
went
by
augsburgh
and
several
other
fine
cities
of
germany
and
arrived
at
trent
on
the
of
april
where
we
celebrated
the
festival
of
easter
being
extremely
anxious
to
revisit
my
beloved
country
i
set
out
from
thence
after
three
days
stay
and
reached
in
the
dominions
of
our
republic
in
discharge
of
a
vow
that
i
had
entered
into
i
went
to
visit
the
church
of
the
blessed
virgin
on
mount
arthon
and
presented
the
offerings
which
i
had
promised
at
her
holy
shrine
i
had
already
sent
notice
to
my
brother
augustine
that
he
might
expect
me
in
venice
towards
evening
of
the
of
april
but
my
extreme
desire
of
getting
back
to
my
country
made
me
get
home
considerably
earlier
embarking
at
break
of
day
i
arrived
at
three
in
the
afternoon
at
and
before
going
to
my
own
house
i
went
in
the
discharge
of
another
vow
to
the
church
of
our
of
and
met
my
brother
on
my
way
in
the
jews
street
we
embraced
with
great
affection
and
went
together
to
the
church
after
finishing
my
devotions
i
went
to
the
palace
as
the
were
then
assembled
it
being
on
a
thursday
i
was
admitted
into
the
council
to
which
i
gave
an
account
of
the
success
of
my
embassy
after
which
as
our
serene
doge
was
indisposed
i
paid
my
respects
to
him
in
his
apartment
and
gave
him
a
short
history
of
my
travels
and
particularly
concerning
those
things
on
which
i
had
been
commissioned
from
thence
i
went
to
my
own
house
where
i
gave
thanks
to
god
for
his
infinite
mercy
in
having
permitted
me
to
return
in
health
and
safety
after
so
many
dangers
to
conclude
although
i
might
have
composed
this
narrative
of
my
travels
in
a
more
eloquent
style
i
have
preferred
truth
in
few
words
to
falsehood
dressed
up
in
ornamented
language
i
have
been
very
brief
in
relation
to
germany
as
that
country
is
in
our
neighbourhood
and
is
therefore
well
known
to
many
on
which
account
it
would
have
been
both
superfluous
and
tiresome
to
have
given
a
minute
description
of
what
every
one
knows
this
almost
certainty
a
corruption
of
troki
though
this
place
must
assuredly
be
a
town

the
king
seemed
to
me
about
seventy
years
of
age
of
large
stature
with
a
pleasant
countenance
and
very
lean
his
eldest
son
named
ogurlu

much
spoken

introduction
the
knowledge
possessed
by
the
ancients
respecting
india
will
be
the
subject
of
discussion
in
a
future
portion
of
this
work
we
have
now
to
contemplate
the
tedious
yet
finally
successful
efforts
of
the
portuguese
nation
in
its
age
of
energetic
heroism
to
discover
a
maritime
passage
to
that
long
famed
commercial
region
some
general
knowledge
of
which
had
been
preserved
ever
since
the
days
of
the
persian
macedonian
and
roman
empires
of
all
the
great
events
which
have
occurred
in
the
modern
ages
previous
to
our
own
times
the
voyages
and
discoveries
which
were
made
by
the
europeans
in
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
of
the
christian
era
are
justly
entitled
to
preference
whether
we
appreciate
the
vast
improvements
which
they
made
in
navigation
and
consequently
in
commerce
the
astonishing
abundance
of
wealth
which
they
brought
into
europe
the
surprising
feats
of
bravery
which
were
performed
in
their
various
expeditions
and
conquests
the
extensive
populous
and
valuable
territories
which
were
subdued
or
colonized
or
the
extended
knowledge
which
was
suddenly
acquired
of
the
greater
part
of
the
earth
till
then
either
altogether
unknown
or
very
partially
and
erroneously
described
by
these
discoveries
we
allude
to
those
of
the
southern
and
western
hemispheres
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
were
opened
up
to
the
astonishment
of
mankind
who
may
be
said
to
have
been
then
furnished
with
wings
to
fly
from
one
end
of
the
earth
to
the
other
so
as
to
bring
the
most
distant
and
hitherto
utterly
unknown
nations
acquainted
with
each
other
in
the
ordinary
course
of
human
affairs
it
has
been
observed
that
similar
events
frequently
occur
but
the
transactions
of
these
times
which
we
now
propose
to
narrate
were
as
singular
in
their
kind
as
they
were
great
surprising
and
unexpected
neither
can
any
such
ever
happen
again
unless
providence
were
to
create
new
and
accessible
worlds
for
discovery
and
conquest
or
to
replunge
the
whole
of
mankind
for
a
long
period
into
the
grossest
ignorance
the
merit
and
glory
of
these
wonderful
achievements
are
unquestionably
due
to
the
portuguese
nation
and
the
first
and
principal
share
to
the
sublime
genius
of
their
illustrious
prince
the
infant
don
henry
of
viseo
and
grand
master
of
the
order
of
whose
enlarged
mind
first
planned
the
fitting
out
of
maritime
expeditions
for
discovery
and
by
the
imitation
of
whose
example
all
subsequent
discoveries
have
been
accomplished
every
thing
of
the
kind
before
his
time
was
isolated
or
accidental
and
every
subsequent
attempt
has
been
pursued
on
scientific
or
known
principles
which
he
invented
and
established
although
america
was
discovered
by
columbus
in
the
service
of
spain
some
years
before
the
portuguese
were
able
to
accomplish
their
long
sought
route
to
india
and
although
the
discovery
of
america
was
performed
infinitely
quicker
than
that
of
southern
africa
and
the
route
to
india
columbus
having
accomplished
his
design
at
the
very
first
attempt
and
even
without
any
previous
knowledge
of
the
countries
he
went
in
search
of
while
the
endeavours
of
the
portuguese
occupied
a
great
number
of
years
in
almost
fruitless
attempts
and
extremely
tedious
progression
yet
don
henry
first
set
on
foot
the
navigation
of
the
ocean
through
unknown
seas
and
inspired
other
nations
with
the
idea
of
making
discoveries
of
distant
and
unexplored
regions
and
ultimately
great
as
were
the
discoveries
of
columbus
they
may
be
said
to
have
been
accidentally
made
in
the
erroneous
attempt
to
go
by
a
nearer
route
to
the
regions
of
which
don
henry
and
his
successors
had
long
been
in
search
these
attempts
of
the
portuguese
had
been
continued
for
nearly
fourscore
years
before
any
of
their
neighbours
seem
to
have
entertained
the
most
distant
idea
of
engaging
in
foreign
discoveries
even
viewing
their
endeavours
as
downright
proceeding
from
a
distempered
imagination
as
well
in
the
first
promoter
as
in
those
who
continued
to
prosecute
his
scheme
in
a
word
the
relation
of
these
discoveries
forms
one
of
the
most
curious
portions
of
modern
history
as
comprizing
a
great
number
of
the
most
extraordinary
transactions
that
ever
happened
in
any
period
of
the
world
for
this
reason
they
are
well
worthy
of
being
particularly
narrated
that
the
curious
may
be
made
acquainted
with
every
successive
step
in
such
important
enterprizes
and
by
what
almost
insensible
degrees
such
vast
undertakings
were
ultimately
accomplished
and
as
the
intercourse
of
europeans
has
operated
a
great
change
in
the
countries
to
which
they
penetrated
and
upon
their
original
inhabitants
so
that
both
now
appear
in
a
very
different
light
from
what
they
did
before
these
expeditions
and
discoveries
therefore
every
circumstance
belonging
to
these
transactions
deserves
the
most
serious
notice

information

had
sent
a
vessel
in
to

the
western
coast
of

being
the
first
voyage
of
discovery
undertaken
by
the
portuguese
or
by
any

in

the
commander
was
instructed
to
endeavour
to
follow
the
western
coast
of
africa
to
the
southward
of
cape
chaunar
called
by
the
portuguese
mariners
cape
nao
non

which
extending
itself
from
the
foot
of
mount
atlas
had
hitherto
been
the
plus
or
impassable
limit
of
european
navigation
and
had
accordingly
received
its
ordinary
name
from
a
negative
term
in
the
portuguese
language
as
implying
that
there
was
no
navigation
beyond
and

saying
was
then
current

following

the
success
of
this
earliest
voyage
fitted
out
for
the
purpose
of
discovery
is
not
recorded
but
don
henry
continued
to
send
some
vessels
every
year
to
the
same
coast
with
the
same
instructions
of
endeavouring
to
explore
the
coast
beyond
cape
non
not
daring
to
trust
themselves
beyond
sight
of
land
the
mariners
crept
timorously
along
the
coast
and
at
length
reached
cape
bojador
only
sixty
leagues
or
miles
beyond
cape
non
this
cape
which
stretches
boldly
out
into
the
ocean
from
which
circumstance
it
derives
its
name
filled
the
portuguese
mariners
with
terror
and
amazement
owing
to
the
shoals
by
which
it
is
environed
for
the
space
of
six
leagues
being
perpetually
beaten
by
a
lofty
and
tremendous
surge
which
precluded
them
from
all
possibility
of
proceeding
beyond
it
in
their
ordinary
manner
of
creeping
along
the
coast
and
they
dared
not
to
stretch
out
into
the
open
sea
in
quest
of
smoother
water
lest
losing
sight
of
land
altogether
they
might
wander
in
the
trackless
ocean
and
be
unable
to
find
their
way
home
it
is
not
impossible
that
they
might
contemplate
the
imaginary
terrors
of
the
torrid
zone
as
handed
down
from
some
of
the
ancients
with
all
its
burning
soil
and
scorching
vapours
and
they
might
consider
the
difficulties
of
cape
bojador
as
a
providential
bar
or
omen
to
warn
and
oppose
them
against
proceeding
to
their
inevitable
destruction
they
accordingly
measured
back
their
wary
steps
along
the
african
coast
and
returned
to
portugal
where
they
gave
an
account
of
their
proceedings
to
don
henry
in
which
of
course
the
dangers
of
the
newly
discovered
cape
would
not
be
diminished
in
their
narrative
returning
from
ceuta
where
his
presence
was
no
longer
necessary
and
where
he
had
matured
his
judgment
by
intercourse
with
various
learned
men
whom
his
bounty
had
attracted
into
africa
and
having
enlarged
his
views
by
the
perusal
of
every
work
which
tended
to
illustrate
the
discoveries
which
he
projected
don
henry
fixed
his
residence
at
the
romantic
town
of
sagres
in
the
neighbourhood
of
cape
st
vincent
where
he
devoted
his
leisure
to
the
study
of
mathematics
astronomy
cosmography
and
the
theory
of
navigation
and
even
established
a
school
or
academy
for
instructing
his
countrymen
in
these
sciences
the
parents
of
commerce
and
the
sure
foundations
of
national
prosperity
to
assist
him
in
the
prosecution
of
these
his
favourite
studies
he
invited
from
majorca
a
person
named
diego
or
james
who
was
singularly
skilful
in
the
management
of
the
instruments
then
employed
for
making
astronomical
observations
at
sea
and
in
the
construction

some
traces

nautical
discoveries

remained
in

from
an
attentive
consideration
of
these
don
henry
and
his
scientific
coadjutor
were
encouraged
to
hope
for
the
accomplishment
of
important
discoveries
in
that
direction
and
they
were
certainly
incited
in
these
views
by
the
rooted
enmity
which
had
so
long
rankled
among
the
christian
inhabitants
of
spain
and
portugal
against
the
moors
who
had
formerly
expelled
their
ancestors
from
the

enjoyed

in
continuing

a
fresh
gale
almost
always
blows
from
the
long
which
extend
a
great
way
out
to
sea
and
which
are
extremely
difficult
to
be
distinguished
in
the
mornings
and
evenings
and
the
prevailing
currents
were
powerful
obstacles
to
the
enterprise
of
these
navigators
about
six
leagues
off
cape
bojador
a
most
violent
current
continually
dashes
upon
the
breakers
which
presented
a
most
formidable
obstacle
to
the
brave
but
inexperienced
mariners
though
their
voyage
was
short
they
encountered
many
dangers
and
before
they
could
reach
the
cape
they
were
encountered
by
a
heavy
gale
from
the
east
by
which
the
billows
of
the
atlantic
became
too
heavy
to
be
resisted
by
their
small
vessel
and
they
were
driven
out
to
sea
on
losing
sight
of
their
accustomed
head
lands
and
being
forced
into
the
boundless
ocean
for
the
first
time
the
ships
company
gave
themselves
up
to
despair
but
on
the
abatement
of
the
tempest
they
found
themselves
unexpectedly
within
view
of
an
island
situated
about
leagues
west
from
the
coast
of
africa
with
extreme
joy
they
beheld
the
coast
of
this
island
extending
about
twenty
miles
in
length
to
which
they
gave
the
name
of
puerto
santo
because
first
discovered
upon
the
feast
of
all
saints
this
is
the
smaller
of
the
madeiras
being
only
about
two
miles
broad
and
as
the
only
roadstead
is
upon
the
side
the
portuguese
probably
anchored
upon
that
side
to
be
under
the
lee
shelter
of
the
island
from
the
remnants
of
the
tempest
from
which
they
had
happily
escaped
the
island
of
or
of
the
holy
haven
is
almost
directly
west
from
cape
cantin
whence
it
would
appear
that
these
portuguese
navigators
could
hardly
have
passed
much
beyond
cape
de
geer
when
driven
off
the
coast
by
this
fortunate
easterly
tempest
had
they
even
advanced
as
far
as
cape
non
they
would
almost
certainly
have
been
driven
among
the
canaries
it
is
perfectly
obvious
that
they
never
even
approached
cape
bojador
in
this
voyage
unless
we
could
suppose
after
having
been
driven
directly
west
from
that
cape
that
they
shaped
a
northern
course
after
the
subsidence
of
the
tempest
and
fell
in
with
puerto
santo
while
on
their
return
to
portugal
greatly
pleased
with
the
soil
and
climate
of
this
island
and
with
the
gentle
manners
of
the
natives
whom
they
described
as
in
an
intermediate
state
of
civilization
and
entirely
destitute
of
any
appearance
of
savage
ferocity
zarco
and
vaz
immediately
returned
to
portugal
where
they
made
a
report
of
the
incidents
of
their
voyage
and
to
confirm
their
opinion
of
the
value
of
their
discovery
they
requested
permission
from
don
henry
to
return
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
a
settlement
in
puerto
santo
by
this
discovery
an
advanced
and
favourable
station
was
secured
towards
the
south
whence
any
discoveries
along
the
coast
of
africa
might
be
prosecuted
with
greater
ease
and
safety
and
from
whence
the
dangers
of
the
hitherto
formidable
cape
bojador
might
be
avoided
by
keeping
a
southerly
or
course
from
puerto
santo
from
these
considerations
don
henry
granted
their
request
and
yielding
to
the
adventurous
spirit
which
this
accidental
discovery
had
excited
he
permitted
several
persons
to
join
in
a
new
projected
voyage
among
whom
was
bartholomew
perestrello
a
nobleman
of
his
household
three
vessels
were
soon
fitted
out
which
were
placed
under
the
respective
commands
of
zarco
vaz
and
perestrello
these
commanders
had
orders
to
colonize
and
cultivate
the
newly
discovered
island
and
were
furnished
with
a
considerable
assortment
of
useful
seeds
and
plants
for
that
purpose
they
happened
likewise
to
take
with
them
a
female
rabbit
great
with
young
which
littered
during
the
voyage
and
which
being
let
loose
with
her
progeny
multiplied
so
rapidly
that
in
two
years
they
became
so
numerous
as
to
occasion
serious
injury
to
the
early
attempts
at
cultivation
and
to
baffle
every
hope
of
rendering
puerto
santo
a
place
of
refreshment
for
the
portuguese
navigators
insomuch
that
a
resolution
was
formed
to
abandon
the
newly
established
settlement
after
having
landed
the
different
animals
and
seeds
which
had
been
sent
out
by
don
henry
and
seeing
them
properly
distributed
perestrello
returned
into
portugal
to
make
a
report
to
the
prince
and
zarco
and
vaz
remained
to
superintend
the
infant
colony
soon
after
the
departure
of
perestrello
the
attention
of
zarco
and
vaz
was
strongly
excited
by
observing
certain
clouds
or
vapours
at
a
great
distance
in
the
ocean
which
continually
presented
the
same
aspect
and
preserved
exactly
the
same
bearing
from
puerto
santo
and
at
length
occasioned
a
conjecture
that
the
appearance
might
proceed
from
land
in
that
quarter
gonsalvo
and
vaz
accordingly
put
to
sea
and
sailed
towards
the
suspected
land
and
soon
discovered
that
the
appearances
which
had
attracted
their
notice
actually
proceeded
from
a
considerable
island
entirely
overgrown
with
wood
to
which
on
that
account
they
gave
the
name
of
madeira
after
bestowing
considerable
attention
upon
the
soil
and
other
circumstances
of
this
island
which
was
utterly
destitute
of
inhabitants
gonzalvo
and
vaz
returned
to
portugal
with
the
welcome
intelligence
and
gave
so
favourable
a
report
of
the
extent
fertility
and
salubrity
of
madeira
that
don
henry
determined
to
colonize
and
cultivate
it
accordingly
with
the
consent
of
the
king
of
portugal
the
island
of
madeira
was
bestowed
in
hereditary
property
upon
zarco
and
vaz
one
division
named
being
given
to
zarco
and
the
other
moiety
named
to
vaz
in
the
year
zarco
began
the
plantation
of
madeira
and
being
much
impeded
in
his
progress
by
the
immense
quantity
of
thick
and
tall
trees
with
which
it
was
then
everywhere
encumbered
he
set
the
wood
on
fire
to
facilitate
the
clearing
of
the
surface
for
cultivation
the
wood
is
reported
to
have
continued
burning
for
seven
years
and
so
great
was
the
devastation
as
to
occasion
great
inconvenience
to
the
colony
for
many
years
afterwards
from
the
want
of
timber
don
henry
appears
to
have
been
a
prince
of
most
uncommonly
enlarged
and
liberal
views
not
only
capable
of
devising
the
means
of
making
maritime
discoveries
which
had
never
been
thought
of
before
his
time
but
of
estimating
their
value
when
made
and
of
applying
them
to
purposes
the
most
useful
and
important
for
his
country
reflecting
upon
the
reported
fertility
of
the
soil
and
the
excellence
of
the
climate
of
madeira
and
comparing
both
with
the
judicious
foresight
of
a
philosopher
politician
and
naturalist
in
reference
to
the
most
valuable
productions
of
similar
climates
and
soils
he
wisely
conceived
and
successfully
executed
the
idea
of
introducing
the
cultivation
of
sugar
and
wines
into
this
new
colony
for
these
purposes
portugal
would
readily
supply
him
with
vines
and
with
people
conversant
in
their
management
but
he
had
to
procure
sugar
canes
and
persons
experienced
in
their
cultivation
and
in
the
process
of
manufacturing
sugar
from
their
juice
from
the
island
of
sicily
into
which
that
article
of
culture
had
been
introduced
by
the
arabs
so
great
was
the
success
of
this
new
subject
of
industry
in
madeira
that
the
fifth
part
of
the
produce
of
one
district
only
little
more
than
nine
miles
in
circumference
which
proportion
the
prince
reserved
as
the
patrimony
of
his
military
order
amounted
in
some
years
to
arobas
of
pounds
each
giving
the
entire
acknowledged
produce
of
one
district
only
of
the
island
at
pounds
or
tons
this
at
the
modern
price
of
eightpence
amounts
to
the
enormous
sum
of
value
of
merchantable
produce
from
a
district
which
could
not
contain
above
english
acres
or
above
the
value
of
of
average
yearly
value
from
every
acre
of
that
district
this
astonishingly
valuable
produce
was
in
the
infancy
of
the
sugar
trade
when
that
bland
and
wholesome
condiment
was
still
an
article
of
luxury
and
not
as
now
almost
an
indispensable
necessary
even
in
the
lowest
cottages
of
modern
europe
the
sugars
of
madeira
were
long
famous
but
after
the
establishment
of
the
sugar
plantations
in
brazil
and
the
destructive
ravages
of
a
worm
which
infested
the
sugar
canes
of
madeira
that
article
of
cultivation
had
to
be
abandoned
and
the
principal
attention
of
the
islanders
was
transferred
to
the
grape
which
still
continues
to
supply
europe
america
and
the
east
indies
with
the
justly
celebrated
madeira
wine
at
the
same
time

the
grant
of

donation
of
the

of
colonizing
it
and

it
into

so
great
was
the

of

all
said
to
have
been
produced
from

of
prosecuting
discoveries
along
the
african
coast
by
the
attentions
requisite
for
forming
this
first
establishment
of

but
chiefly
owing
to
the
extreme
difficulties
of
the
navigation
in
the
infancy
of
that

fifteen
years
were
passed
from
the

discovery
of
cape

before
that
formidable
obstacle
could
be
surmounted
in
all
ages
of
the
world
ignorant
and
indolent
men
have
represented
new
and
unusual
enterprises
in
scientific
pursuits
as
rash
or
improper
deviations
from
the
established
experience
and
vaunted
wisdom
of
antiquity
and
those
who
promoted
them
have
been
held
out
as
dangerous
or
even
impious
innovators
it
so
fared
with
don
henry
who
far
outstripped
the
science
or
ignorance
rather
of
his
day
at
home
the
discontented
spirits
ignorant
of
his
enlarged
views
perhaps
envious
of
the
reputation
his
very
limited
discoveries
had
already
attained
represented
that
the
tempestuous
seas
strong
currents
and
whirlpools
which
they
fancied
must
prevail
on
the
other
side
of
cape
bajadore
would
necessarily
destroy
every
vessel
which
should
attempt
to
penetrate
beyond
that
absolute
limit
of
human
navigation
they
alleged
that
all
the
country
to
the
south
of
that
cape
was
utterly
unfit
for
the
habitation
of
mankind
sterile
burnt
up
and
destitute
of
soil
and
water
like
the
sandy
deserts
of
lybia
and
they
pretended
to
object
on
principles
of
patriotism
that
the
natives
of
portugal
were
improvidently
wasted
on
idle
discoveries
which
if
at
all
advisable
would
have
been
undertaken
by
their
former
wise
sovereigns
who
contented
with
the
known
world
did
not
vainly
seek
for
conquests
in
the
torrid
zone
which
was
altogether
unfit
for
the
habitation
of
mankind
they
insinuated
that
the
expences
which
had
been
lavished
upon
those
fruitless
and
dangerous
maritime
expeditions
might
lave
been
much
more
profitably
employed
for
the
improvement
of
some
of
the
more
barren
parts
of
portugal
even
the
probable
profits
and
advantages
derivable
from
the
new
colonies
of
madeira
and
puerto
santo
as
they
were
only
eventual
and
contingent
did
not
satisfy
the
minds
of
those
discontented
detractors
from
the
merits
and
enlightened
views
of
the
prince
but
don
henry
despised
those
vain
endeavours
to
misrepresent
and
counteract
the
important
enterprise
in
which
he
was
engaged
and
undismayed
by
the
natural
difficulties
which
had
hitherto
retarded
the
progress
of
his
mariners
continued
his
laudable
endeavours
to
extend
his
discoveries
along
the
coast
of
africa
the
people
likewise
whom
he
employed
in
his
service
frequently
made
predatory
invasions
on
the
coast
taking
every
moorish
vessel
which
they
were
able
to
master
and
made
many
slaves
by
the
sale
of
which
the
charges
attending
those
maritime
expeditions
were
partly
defrayed
about
the
year
one
gilianez
a
native
of
lagos
whom
the
prince
had
entrusted
with
the
command
of
a
vessel
returned
from
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
conquer
the
invincible
obstacles
which
obstructed
the
passage
round
cape
bojador
he
had
been
driven
by
stress
of
weather
into
one
of
the
canary
islands
and
had
imprudently
seized
some
of
the
inoffending
natives
whom
he
brought
captives
to
sagres
don
henry
was
much
offended
by
this
conduct
of
gilianez
whom
he
received
with
much
coldness
and
reserve
insomuch
that
gilianez
on
purpose
to
retrieve
the
princes
favour
and
to
make
ample
amends
for
the
fault
he
had
committed
made
a
vow
that
if
entrusted
with
a
new
expedition
he
would
perish
rather
than
return
unsuccessful
in
the
enterprize
which
the
prince
had
so
much
at
heart
the
date
of
the
second
expedition
of
gilianez
in
which
he
surmounted
the
terrors
and
difficulties
of
cape
bajador
is
variously
referred
by
different
authors
to
the
years
and
however
this
may
have
been
he
succeeded
in
this
herculean
labour
as
it
was
then
esteemed
and
returned
with
great
exultation
to
sagres
where
he
was
again
received
into
the
favour
and
confidence
of
don
henry
contrary
to
the
assertions
or
suppositions
rather
of
the
discontented
opposers
of
the
patriotic
and
enlightened
efforts
of
don
henry
gilianez
reported
that
the
sea
beyond
cape
bojador
was
perfectly
susceptible
of
navigation
and
that
the
soil
and
climate
were
both
excellent
in
the
following
year
gilianez
again
sailed
for
the
coast
of
africa
accompanied
by
alphonzo
gonzales
baldaya
cupbearer
to
the
prince
the
weather
continued
favourable
during
the
voyage
and
they
were
able
to
penetrate
ninety
miles
to
the
south
of
cape
bojador
on
landing
to
take
a
view
of
the
country
and
in
search
of
inhabitants
they
found
the
former
to
consist
for
the
most
part
of
an
extended
desert
plain
and
they
were
much
disappointed
in
not
being
able
to
meet
with
any
of
the
inhabitants
though
they
saw
evident
traces
of
them
in
the
sand
to
the
bay
in
which
they
landed
they
gave
the
name
of
angra
dos
ruyvos
or
bay
of
gurnets
from
the
great
abundance
of
fish
resembling
gurnets
which
were
taken
by
the
seamen
gilianez
and
baldaya
were
again
ordered
in
the
year
to
prosecute
their
discoveries
with
instructions
to
prolong
their
voyage
if
possible
till
they
should
meet
with
inhabitants
having
proceeded
about
forty
miles
to
the
southward
of
the
angra
dos
ruyvos
without
being
able
to
see
a
single
inhabitant
they
adopted
an
expedient
which
had
been
suggested
by
don
henry
and
for
which
they
were
provided
with
the
means
two
horses
were
landed
and
two
youths
named
hector
homen
and
diego
lopez
who
had
been
educated
in
the
household
of
don
henry
and
were
scarcely
sixteen
years
of
age
were
directed
to
penetrate
into
the
interior
of
the
country
that
they
might
endeavour
to
ascertain
whether
it
were
inhabited
they
were
directed
to
keep
close
together
and
on
no
account
to
leave
their
horses
and
if
possible
to
bring
back
some
of
the
moors
and
lest
they
should
rashly
expose
themselves
to
unnecessary
danger
they
were
only
allowed
each
a
sword
and
spear
without
any
defensive
armour
after
wandering
almost
a
whole
day
in
the
barren
sandy
desert
they
at
length
descried
nineteen
africans
armed
with
assagays
or
javelins
whom
they
ventured
to
attack
though
contrary
to
their
orders
the
natives
retreated
into
a
cave
where
they
were
safe
from
the
farther
assaults
of
the
rash
portuguese
youths
and
as
one
of
them
had
received
a
wound
in
the
foot
they
thought
it
prudent
to
return
to
the
shore
which
they
were
unable
to
reach
before
the
next
morning
gilianez
and
baldaya
then
dispatched
a
stronger
force
to
the
cave
in
which
the
africans
had
taken
shelter
where
nothing
was
found
but
some
weapons
which
had
been
left
by
the
fugitives
owing
to
this
event
the
place
where
the
two
cavaliers
were
landed
was
named
angra
dos
cavallos
or
the
bay
of
horses
which
is
in
latitude
the
navigators
proceeded
along
a
rugged
coast
to
the
south
of
the
bay
of
horses
upon
which
the
sea
breaks
with
a
terrible
noise
and
which
on
account
of
being
entirely
composed
of
a
hilly
shore
faced
with
rocks
and
small
rocky
islands
is
called
or
the
rocky
place
at
about
twelve
leagues
distance
from
the
bay
of
cavallos
they
entered
the
mouth
of
a
river
where
they
killed
a
number
of
sea
wolves
or
seals
the
skins
of
which
they
took
on
board
in
defect
of
any
other
productions
of
the
country
these
seals
were
found
on
an
island
at
the
mouth
of
this
river
on
which
the
mariners
are
said
to
have
seen
at
least
asleep
on
the
shore
the
voyage
was
continued
to
punta
de
gale
forming
the
western
of
the
rio
de
ouro
immediately
under
the
tropic
where
a
fishing
net
was
found
constructed
of
twine
made
from
the
inner
bark
of
some
tree
of
the
palm
tribe
but
no
natives
were
met
with
and
as
provisions
began
to
grow
scarce
the
adventurous
mariners
were
constrained
to
return
into
portugal
after
ranging
for
some
time
up
and
down
the
rocky
coast
of
otegado
without
making
any
important
discovery
about
this
period
or
perhaps
considerably
earlier
don
henry
obtained
a
bull
from
pope
martin
by
which
the
sovereign
pontiff
made
a
perpetual
donation
to
the
crown
of
portugal
of
all
lands
and
islands
which
had
been
or
might
be
discovered
between
cape
bojador
and
the
east
indies
inclusively
and
granted
a
plenary
indulgence
for
the
souls
of
all
who
might
perish
in
the
prosecution
of
the
enterprize
and
in
achieving
the
conquest
of
these
extensive
regions
from
the
infidel
and
pagan
enemies
of
christ
and
the
church
in
this
measure
the
philosophical
genius
and
enlarged
political
views
of
don
henry
are
plainly
evinced
and
undismayed
by
the
obstacles
which
had
so
long
opposed
his
grand
project
of
discoveries
and
the
length
of
time
which
had
been
employed
in
making
so
very
small
progress
he
shewed
himself
to
have
looked
steadily
forwards
to
the
full
accomplishment
of
his
hopes
of
discovering
the
route
by
sea
from
europe
to
india
around
the
still
unknown
shores
of
southern
africa
the
date
of
this
papal
grant
does
not
certainly
appear
de
barros
and
lafitau
are
of
opinion
that
it
must
have
been
posterior
to
purchas
places
it
in
and
de
guyon
in
but
martin
died
in
and
these
writers
seem
to
have
confounded
the
original
grant
from
that
pontiff
with
subsequent
confirmations
by
his
successors
eugenius
iv
nicholas
and
sextus
iv
the
gradual
progress
of
these
discoveries
were
interrupted
for
a
time
by
an
unsuccessful
attempt
of
edward
or
king
of
portugal
to
gain
possession
of
tangier
in
the
kingdom
of
fez
but
the
history
of
this
war
in
which
the
portuguese
arms
suffered
much
misfortune
and
dishonour
are
quite
irrelevant
to
the
present
subject
the
plague
likewise
which
raged
at
lisbon
in
contributed
to
the
suspension
of
the
patriotic
enterprizes
of
don
henry
at
length
in
don
henry
resumed
his
project
of
maritime
discovery
and
dispatched
two
caravels
from
sagres
which
were
forced
back
by
unfavourable
weather
apparently
without
even
reaching
the
coast
of
africa
in
a
young
officer
named
antonio
gonzales
made
a
voyage
in
a
small
vessel
with
a
crew
of
men
to
the
island
where
so
great
a
number
of
sea
wolves
had
been
seen
in
the
former
voyage
of
alphonzo
gonzales
baldaya
in
in
this
voyage
alphonzo
gotterez
a
gentleman
of
the
to
don
henry
acted
as
secretary
and
the
two
adventurers
were
instructed
to
endeavour
to
obtain
an
account
of
the
country
and
its
inhabitants
and
to
procure
a
cargo
of
the
skins
of
the
seals
or
sea
wolves
that
the
voyage
might
not
be
entirely
destitute
of
some
commercial
advantages
after
accomplishing
this
part
of
his
instructions
gonzales
determined
to
use
his
utmost
efforts
for
procuring
some
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
to
carry
back
with
him
to
sagres
for
this
purpose
he
landed
at
the
beginning
of
the
night
with
nine
associates
and
having
advanced
about
ten
miles
into
the
interior
discovered
a
native
following
a
camel
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
portuguese
rendered
the
astonished
moor
perfectly
motionless
and
before
he
could
recover
from
his
surprize
he
was
seized
by

on
their
return
to
the
shore
with
their
prisoner
they
traced
some
recent
footsteps
on
the
sand
which
led
them
in
view
of
about
forty
natives
who
withdrew
to
an
adjoining
hill
but
the
portuguese
secured
a
female
moor
who
had
strayed
from
the
party
with
these
two
prisoners
they
returned
to
their
vessel
not
choosing
to
run
any
unnecessary
risk
or
to
make
any
needless
attack
upon
the
natives
which
was
contrary
to
the
express
orders
of
don
henry
when
preparing
next
morning
to
set
sail
on
their
return
to
portugal
another
portuguese
ship
arrived
which
was
commanded
by
nuno
tristan
a
gentleman
of
the
princes
household
encouraged
by
this
reinforcement
a
second
expedition
into
the
interior
was
immediately
resolved
upon
in
which
nuno
tristan
diego
de
vigliadores
and
gonzales
de
cintra
joined
with
alphonzo
gonzales
and
alphonzo
gotterez
advancing
again
under
night
they
soon
perceived
a
party
of
the
natives
whom
they
immediately
attacked
shouting
out
portugal
portugal
san
jago
san
jago
the
moors
were
at
first
stupified
with
fear
and
surprise
but
recovering
from
their
panic
a
struggle
ensued
in
which
three
of
the
moors
were
slain
and
ten
made
prisoners
the
portuguese
being
indebted
for
their
safety
to
their
defensive
armour
after
endeavouring
in
vain
to
establish
an
intercourse
with
the
moors
for
the
redemption
of
the
prisoners
alphonzo
gonzales
returned
to
sagres
with
a
cargo
of
skins
and
the
moorish
prisoners
and
was
honourably
rewarded
by
his
discerning
master
the
place
of
this
exploit
was
named
puerto
del
cavallero
or
the
knights
harbour
on
occasion
of
gonzales
being
there
knighted
by
nuno
tristan
after
careening
his
vessel
nuno
tristan
proceeded
along
the
coast
according
to
his
orders
and
reached
a
cape
in
lat
to
which
he
gave
the
name
of
cabo
branco
or
the
white
cape
on
account
of
the
whiteness
of
its
cliffs
he
there
landed
and
found
some
fishing
nets
on
the
shore
but
after
repeated
incursions
into
the
country
being
unable
to
meet
with
any
of
the
natives
he
made
a
survey
of
the
coast
and
returned
to
portugal
with
an
account
of
his
proceedings
three
of
the
prisoners
carried
to
portugal
by
gonzales
were
moors
of
some
rank
and
considerable
opulence
who
each
promised
to
pay
ransoms
for
their
safe
return
to
their
native
country
and
to
give
besides
six
or
seven
slaves
each
to
the
captors
don
henry
as
grand
master
of
the
order
of
christ
was
eager
for
the
acquisition
of
so
many
converts
from
the
religion
of
mahomet
and
was
in
hopes
that
the
favourable
report
which
the
moors
might
make
on
their
return
to
africa
would
induce
the
natives
to
enter
into
trade
with
his
navigators
and
that
among
the
slaves
which
were
to
be
given
in
exchange
some
certain
knowledge
might
be
acquired
of
the
burning
regions
of
africa
about
which
such
strange
reports
were
then
prevalent
antonio
gonzales
was
therefore
dispatched
on
another
voyage
in
accompanied
by
a
german
gentleman
named
balthazar
who
had
distinguished
himself
in
the
late
unfortunate
attempt
on
tangier
and
who
was
anxious
to
carry
home
some
account
of
the
newly
discovered
countries
after
being
forced
to
return
to
port
to
repair
the
damages
they
had
sustained
in
a
dreadful
tempest
they
again
sailed
and
reached
the
coast
where
the
moors
had
been
made
prisoners
the
principal
moor
was
landed
and
was
received
with
great
deference
and
respect
by
his
countrymen
but
he
forgot
all
his
promises
on
regaining
his
liberty
and
never
returned
to
pay
the
ransom
he
had
bargained
for
it
would
appear
however
that
he
had
informed
the
natives
of
the
return
of
the
other
two
chiefs
as
at
the
end
of
nine
days
above
an
hundred
natives
appeared
on
the
coast
and
entered
into
treaty
for
the
ransom
of
their
two
countrymen
who
remained
captives
and
for
whom
ten
negroes
natives
of
different
parts
of
africa
were
given
in
exchange
during
these
transactions
the
sight
of
a
considerable
quantity
of
gold
dust
in
the
possession
of
the
moors
excited
the
most
lively
emotions
in
the
portuguese
as
being
the
first
intimation
of
that
valuable
commodity
being
procurable
on
the
coast
of
their
new
discoveries
from
this
circumstance
gonzales
gave
the
name
of
del
or
gold
river
to
the
deep
arm
of
the
sea
in
which
he
now
lay
which
penetrates
about
six
leagues
from
the
tropic
of
cancer
section
iv
of
discovery
to
cape
de
on
the
return
from
this
voyage
the
sight
of
gold
placed
the
fame
and
advantage
of
the
enterprizes
and
discoveries
of
don
henry
beyond
the
reach
of
prejudice
and
detraction
and
the
former
murmurings
and
discontents
against
his
proceedings
were
changed
into
admiration
and
applause
in
nuno
tristan
was
again
sent
out
with
orders
to
prosecute
the
discovery
of
a
coast
which
now
seemed
so
likely
to
prove
advantageous
to
the
commerce
of
portugal
he
now
doubled
cape
blanco
or
branco
which
he
had
discovered
in
his
former
voyage
and
about
ten
leagues
farther
to
the
fell
in
with
an
island
or
rather
cluster
of
seven
islands
called
by
the
natives
but
which
have
since
with
the
bay
in
which
they
lie
received
the
name
of
arguim
or
arguin
the
small
canoes
which
were
used
by
the
natives
of
this
coast
were
at
first
mistaken
for
some
strange
kind
of
birds
as
the
people
sit
upon
them
astride
using
their
feet
instead
of
paddles
to
urge
them
along
to
one
of
the
islands
in
this
bay
tristan
gave
the
name
of
garças
on
account
of
the
seasonable
supply
which
he
there
received
from
this
place
nuno
tristan
returned
into
portugal
with
some
of
the
natives
of
the
country
don
henry
in
made
an
exchange
with
massiot
de
betancour
lord
of
the
canary
islands
for
the
islands
of
lancerota
fuertaventura
and
ferro
giving
him
some
possessions
in
the
island
of
madeira
in
their
stead
and
immediately
fitted
out
a
powerful
squadron
commanded
by
the
grand
master
of
his
household
fernand
de
castro
to
take
possession
of
this
new
acquisition
and
to
subdue
the
remaining
islands
canaria
palma
gratioso
inferno
alegrazze
rocca
and
lobos
but
as
the
king
of
castile
afterwards
laid
claim
to
the
canaries
don
henry
resigned
his
conquests
finding
the
value
of
these
islands
by
no
means
answerable
to
his
expectation
so
greatly
had
the
fame
of
the
new
discoveries
extended
in
consequence
of
the
small
quantity
of
gold
which
had
been
procured
by
gonzales
at
the
rio
del
ouro
that
several
of
the
inhabitants
of
lagos
petitioned
don
henry
in
to
be
erected
into
a
trading
company
engaging
to
carry
on
the
discoveries
along
the
coast
of
africa
at
their
own
expence
the
prince
granted
their
request
and
a
company
was
accordingly
formed
the
prototype
of
those
celebrated
east
india
companies
which
have
since
carried
on
trade
to
such
vast
amount
among
the
partners
were
juan
diaz
the
ancestor
of
him
who
afterwards
discovered
and
passed
the
cape

hope

had
so
boldly
overcome
the
obstacles
of
cape
bajador
lançerot
a
gentleman
of
the
household
of
don
henry
estevan
alfonso
and
rodrigo
alvarez
a
squadron
of
six
caravels
was
fitted
out
under
the
command
of
lançerot
which
sailed
from
lagos
in
the
year
and
reached
the
isle
of
garças
in
the
bay
of
arguin
where
they
captivated
an
hundred
and
fifty
africans
and
returned
to
lagos
after
very
slightly
extending
their
knowledge
of
the
coast
of
africa
to
the
desart
island
of
tider
in
in
the
subsequent
voyage
of
gonzales
da
cintra
likewise
a
gentleman
in
the
household
of
don
henry
in
some
measure
expiated
the
wanton
outrage
which
had
been
committed
in
that
of
lançerot
the
merit
of
gonzales
had
raised
him
to
the
rank
of
a
gentleman
in
the
household
of
don
henry
and
his
character
was
held
in
much
estimation
but
his
confidence
was
obtained
and
betrayed
by
a
moor
of
the
assanhaji
tribe
whom
he
had
taken
on
board
to
serve
as
an
interpreter
with
the
natives
on
the
coast
of
africa
misled
by
this
crafty
african
who
held
out
great
hopes
of
acquiring
plunder
gonzales
steered
for
the
island
of
arguin
and
put
into
a
creek
or
bay
on
the
coast
in
lat
about
fourteen
leagues
to
the
south
of

leave
to
go
on
shore
under
pretence
of
visiting
some
relations
but
escaped
in
the
night
with
another
of
his
countrymen
gonzales
was
much
mortified
at
allowing
himself
to
be
circumvented
by
the
cunning
of
his
interpreter
and
rashly
embarked
in
a
boat
with
only
twelve
men
with
the
intention
of
pursuing
the
fugitive
pressing
onwards
with
too
much
eagerness
he
neglected
to
attend
to
the
tide
which
happened
then
to
be
on
the
ebb
his
boat
stuck
fast
and
when
the
morning
broke
he
was
surrounded
by
two
hundred
moors
unable
to
extricate
himself
or
to
contend
against
such
mighty
odds
gonzales
and
seven
of
his
men
were
slain
the
other
five
made
their
escape
by
swimming
to
the
ship
which
immediately
set
sail
for

strictly
enjoined
to
cultivate
the
friendship
of
the

by
every
possible
means
to
establish
peace
with
them
and
to
use
their
utmost
endeavours
to
convert
them
to
the
christian
religion
among

instructions
they
were
urged
to
pass
unnoticed
the
insults

which
they

ineffectually
to
conciliate
the
natives
and
to
remove
the
angry
prejudices
which
they
entertained
they
returned
to
lagos
with
no
other
fruit
from
their
voyage
except
one
negro
whom
they
had
received
in
ransom
and
an
aged

who
requested
permission
to
accompany

ordered
to
return
in

from
whose
inquisitive
disposition
much
information
was
expected
in
this
expedition
he
was
accompanied
by
two
other
caravels
commanded
by
garcia
mendez
and
diego
alfonso
but
they
were
separated
by
a
storm
in
the
early
part
of
the
voyage
alfonso
was
the
first
who
reached
the
coast
at
cape
branco
where
he
landed
and
set
up
a
wooden
cross
as
a
signal
to
his
consorts
and
then
proceeded
to
the
islands
of
arguin
which
afforded
shelter
from
the
tremenduous
surf
which
breaks
continually
on
the
coast
of
africa
while
waiting
at
arguin
for
the
other
ships
alfonso
paid
many
visits
to
the
continent
where
he
made
prisoners
of
of
the
natives
when
the
other
two
ships
of
the
squadron
had
joined

went
to
the
rio

of
their
countryman
juan
fernandez
who
had
been
several
days
anxiously
looking
out
for
a
vessel
to
carry
him
off
after
experiencing
many
hardships
fernandez
had
succeeded
in
gaining
the
friendship
of
a
considerable
person
among
the
moors
and
was
accompanied
to
the
shore
by
that
mans
slaves
in
a
body

natives
exerted
themselves
to
procure
the
release
of
some
of
their
countrymen
who
were
prisoners
with
the
portuguese
to
whom
they
gave
nine
negroes
and
a
quantity
of
gold
dust
by
way
of
ransom

the
place

this
transaction
took
place

the
name
of

nobleman
received
the
honour
of

had
long
been
entitled
to
but
which
he
would
only
receive
upon
the
newly

touched
at
a
village
near

over
to

permitted

at

reached
the
most
westerly

the
natives
to
the
memory
of
gonzales
da
cintra
and
the
mariners
of
gram
on
this
occasion
two
of
the
portuguese
officers
were
knighted
on
the
newly
discovered
coast
which
seems
then
to
have
been
a
fashionable
ambition
among
them
no
doubt
arising
from
the
prevailing
zeal
for
maritime
discovery
from
arguin
lançarot
passed
over
to
the
isle
of
tider
whence
the
inhabitants
made
their
escape
to
the
adjacent
continent
but
the
portuguese
soon
followed
and
the
astonished
moors
fled
on
all
sides
after
a
sharp
skirmish
in
which
a
good
many
of
them
were
slain
and
sixty
taken
prisoners
the
fleet
now
separated
a
part
returning
home
by
way
of
the
canaries
while
lançarot
with
several
other
caravels
advanced
along
the
coast
of
africa
southwards
till
he
got
beyond
what
the
moors
called
the
çahara
or
sahara
of
the
assenaji
this
moorish
nation
is
mentioned
by
abulfeda
as
the
ruling
tribe
in
audagost
or
agadez
and
as
inhabiting
the
southern
part
of
morocco
they
are
therefore
to
be
considered
as
the
peculiar
people
of
the
great
desert
and
its
environs
at
its
western
extremity
on
the
atlantic
the
latter
part
of
their
name
or
rather
aspirated
signifies
a
pilgrim
and
is
now
the
appropriate
title
of
one
who
has
made
the
great
pilgrimage
of
mecca
in
the
present
case
the
name
of
assenaji
probably
signifies
the
of
the
the
sanhaga
or
assenaji
tribe
is
now
placed
at
no
great
distance
from
the
african
coast
between
the
rivers
nun
and
senegal
and
this
latter
river
has
probably
received
its
portuguese
name
of
sanaga
from
that
tribe
ptolemy
likewise
probably
named
cape
verd
from
the
same
people
from
which
it
may
be
inferred
that
they
anciently
occupied
both
sides
of
the
senegal
river
which
is
named
by
that
ancient
geographer
twenty
leagues
beyond
the
southern
boundary
of
the
great
desert
lançarot
came
to
the
mouth
of
a
large
river
which
had
been
formerly
seen
by
denis
fernandez
and
named
by
him
or
the
portuguese
river
which
was
called
by
the
natives
and
afterwards
got
the
name
of
canaga
zanaga
sanhaga
sanaga
or
senega
now
the
senegal
lançarot
passed
in
safety
over
the
bar
of
this
river
and
endeavoured
to
explore
its
course
upwards
but
the
weather
became
unfavourable
and
forced
him
again
to
sea
when
he
proceeded
with
part
of
his
squadron
to
cape
verd
near
which
place
he
took
in
a
supply
of
water
and
goats
flesh
the
fleet
was
again
dispersed
by
a
second
storm
and
only
three
vessels
remained
under
the
command
of
lançarot
with
these
he
made
a
descent
on
the
island
of
tider
where
he
captured
moors
and
with
these
and
some
natives
he
had
made
prisoners
on
the
banks
of
the
senegal
he
returned
into
portugal
in
the
year
nuna
tristan
made
another
voyage
to
the
coast
of
africa
and
advancing
beyond
dos
or
the
cape
of
masts
so
named
from
some
dead
palms
resembling
masts
seen
there
by
lançarot
who
made
this
discovery
in
the
former
voyage
nuna
tristan
proceeded
southwards
along
the
coast
of
africa
miles
beyond
cape
verd
where
he
reached
the
mouth
of
a
river
which
he
called
rio
grande
or
the
large
river
since
called
gamber
gambra
or
gambia
tristan
came
to
anchor
at
the
mouth
of
this
river
and
went
in
his
boat
with
armed
men
on
purpose
to
explore
its
course
having
reached
to
a
considerable
distance
from
his
ship
he
was
environed
by
thirteen
almadias
or
canoes
manned
by
eighty
negroes
who
advanced
with
dreadful
yells
and
poured
in
continual
vollies
of
poisoned
arrows
by
which
he
and
almost
every
man
in
his
boat
were
wounded
before
they
could
regain
the
ship
nuno
tristan
and
all
the
wounded
men
died
speedily
of
the
effects
of
these
poisoned
weapons
himself
only
living
long
enough
to
recount
the
nature
of
the
terrible
disaster
to
the
small
remainder
of
the
crew
who
had
been
left
in
charge
of
the
caravel
which
was
brought
home
by
only
four
survivors
after
wandering
for
two
months
in
the
atlantic
scarcely
knowing
which
way
to
steer
their
course
there
appears
some
difficulty
and
contradiction
in
regard
to
the
river
discovered
by
nuna
tristan
from
the
vague
name
of
rio
grande
instead
of
the
gambia
in
lat
some
of
the
portuguese
historians
are
inclined
to
believe
that
this
fatal
event
took
place
at
another
river
in
lat
at
least
nautical
miles
beyond
the
gambia
to
the
which
was
afterwards
called
rio
de
nuno
this
is
scarcely
probable
as
no
notice
whatever
is
taken
of
the
great
archipelago
of
shoals
and
islands
which
extend
from
cabo
rosso
to
beyond
the
mouth
of
that
river
which
is
still
called
rio
grande
yet
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
our
remaining
information
respecting
these
early
portuguese
voyages
of
discovery
is
unfortunately
vague
and
unsatisfactory
in
the
same
year
alvaro
fernando
proceeded
to
the
coast
of
africa
and
is
said
to
have
advanced
forty
leagues
beyond
tristan
having
arrived
at
the
mouth
of
a
river
called
tabite
miles
to
the
south
of
rio
nuno
notwithstanding
the
appearance
of
a
determined
opposition
on
the
part
of
the
natives
who
had
manned
five
almadias
alvaro
resolved
to
explore
its
course
in
his
boat
and
proceeded
up
the
river
for
that
purpose
with
the
utmost
circumspection
one
of
the
almadias
stood
out
from
the
rest
and
attacked
his
boat
with
great
bravery
discharging
a
number
of
poisoned
arrows
by
which
alvaro
and
several
of
his
men
were
wounded
which
forced
him
to
desist
and
return
to
his
ship
being
however
provided
with
and
other
antidotes
against
the
poison
alvaro
and
all
his
men
recovered
from
their
wounds
he
resolved
after
leaving
the
river
tabite
to
proceed
along
the
coast
which
he
did
to
a
sandy
point
and
apprehending
no
danger
in
so
open
a
situation
was
preparing
to
land
when
he
was
suddenly
assailed
by
a
flight
of
poisoned
arrows
from
negroes
who
started
up
from
a
concealment
alvaro
therefore
desisted
from
any
farther
attempt
to
explore
the
coast
and
returned
to
lagos
to
give
an
account
of
his
proceedings
in
the
same
year
ten
caravels
sailed
from
lagos
for
madeira
the
canaries
and
the
coast
of
africa
but
returned
without
making
any
progress
in
discovering
the
coast
under
this
year
likewise
the
antilles
or
caribbee
islands
are
pretended
to
have
been
discovered
by
a
portuguese
ship
driven
thither
by
a
storm
but
the
fact
rests
only
on
the
authority
of
galvano
a
portuguese
historian
and
is
not
at
all
credible
indeed
the
story
is
an
absolute
fable
as
the
inhabitants
are
said
to
have
spoken
the
portuguese
language
and
to
have
had
in
their
island
in
the
same
year
gomez
perez
went
with
two
caravels
to
rio
del
ouro
whence
he
carried
eighty
moors
to
lagos
as
prisoners
about
this
period
the
progress
of
discovery
was
arrested
by
political
disputes
in
portugal
which
ended
in
a
civil
war
between
don
pedro
duke
of
coimbra
and
king
alphonso
his
nephew
and
in
the
course
of
which
don
pedro
was
slain
don
henry
appears
to
have
taken
no
share
in
these
disputes
except
by
endeavouring
to
mediate
between
his
nephew
and
brother
and
after
the
unhappy
catastrophe
of

pedro
don
henry
returned
to

this
an

been
traced
on
a
rock
beneath
the
statue
but
in
a
language
which
the
portuguese
did
not
understand
in
the
slow
progress
of

the
perils
endured
by
the
officers
and
men
employed
by
don
henry
from
the
moors
and
negroes
frequently
occasioned
murmurs
against
his
plans
of
discovery
but
the
several
clusters
of
islands
the
madeiras
cape
verd
and
açores
formed
a
succession
of
maritime
and
commercial
colonies
and
nurseries
for
seamen
which
took
off
from
the
general
obloquy
attending
the
tedious
and
hitherto
unsuccessful
attempts
to
penetrate
farther
into
the
southern
hemisphere
and
afforded
a
perpetual
supply
of
navigators
and
a
stimulus
to
enterprize
the
original
prejudices
against
the
possibility
of
navigating
or
existing
in
the
torrid
zone
still
subsisted
and
although
the
navigators
of
don
henry
had
gradually
penetrated
to
within
ten
degrees
of
the
equator
yet
the
last
successive
discovery
was
always
held
forth
by
the
supporters
of
ignorant
prejudice
as
that
which
had
been
placed
by
nature
as
an
insurmountable
barrier
to
farther
progress
in
the
atlantic
in
this
situation
the
settlement
of
the
açores
was
of
considerable
importance
in
don
henry
procured
the
grant
of
many
valuable
privileges
to
this
favourite
colony
the
principal
of
which
was
the
exemption
of
the
inhabitants
from
any
duties
on
their
commerce
to
the
ports
of
portugal
and
even
of
spain
in

fort

erected

antonio

a
genoese
sent
by
the
republic
to
portugal
entered
into
the
service
of
don
henry
and
in
a
voyage
to
the
coast
of
africa
discovered
the
islands
which
are
known
by
the
name
of
the
cape
de

they
lie
leagues
to
the
westward
of

a
little
farther
along
the
coast
of
africa
and
discovered
the
river
or
bay
of
sierra
liona
or
mitomba
in
lat
this
constituted
the
last
of
the
portuguese
discoveries
carried
on
under
the
direct
influence
and
authority
of
don
henry
the
founder
and
father
of
modern
maritime
discovery
as
he
died
next
year
at
sagres
in
the
year
of
his
age
and
for
a
time
the
maritime
enterprise
of
the
portuguese
nation
was
palsied
by
his
death
thus
during
a
long
period
of
years
this
patriotic
prince
devoted
almost
his
whole
attention
and
the
ample
revenues
which
he
enjoyed
as
duke
of
viseo
end
grand
master
of
the
military
order
of
christ
in
extending
the
maritime
knowledge
and
consequently
the
commercial
prosperity
of
his
country
the
incidents
of
the
last
seven
years
of
the
life
of
this
distinguished
prince
are
involved
in
uncertainty
and
we
know
very
little
with
regard
to
the
progress
of
his
maritime
discoveries
from
the
date
of
the
second
of
the
voyages
of
cada
mosto
of
which
we
propose
to
give
a
separate
account
till
the
year
of
his
death
from
the
year
when
he
began
his
operations
at
which
time
he
could
scarcely
exceed
fifteen
years
of
age
the
navigators
who
had
been
formed
under
his
auspices
and
direction
and
often
instructed
by
himself
in
the
theory
of
navigation
and
cosmography
gradually
explored
the
western
coast
of
africa
from
cape
nam
or
non
in
lat
certainly
to
rio
grande
in
lat
or
rather
to
rio
de
nuno
not
quite
a
degree
farther
south
but
it
is
highly
probable
that
the
southern
limit
of
discovery
in
his
time
extended
to
cabo
verga
in
lat
the
northern
boundary
of
the
country
usually
called
the
sierra
liona
or
the
ridge
of
lions
perhaps
to
the
gulf
of
mitomba
or
bay
of
sierra
liona
in
lat
an
extent
of
of
latitude
or
nautical
miles
a
mere
nothing
certainly
when
compared
with
modern
navigation
but
a
wonderful
effort
in
the
infancy
of
the
science
when
even
coasting
voyages
of
any
extent
along
well
known
shores
and
in
frequented
seas
were
looked
upon
as
considerable
efforts
no
brilliant
discovery
indeed
rewarded
the
perseverance
of
don
henry
and
the
courage
of
his
servants
but
an
indestructible
foundation
of
useful
knowledge
was
laid
for
overthrowing
the
ignorant
prejudices
of
the
age
and
by
which
not
long
afterwards
his
plans
were
perfected
by
completing
the
circumnavigation
of
africa
and
by
the
discovery
of
the
world
dr
vincent
the
learned
editor
and
commentator
of
the
periplus
of
the
erythrean
sea
is
disposed
to
limit
the
discoveries
of
don
henry
to
cape
verd
but
ramusio
believed
that
the
island
of
st
thomas
was
settled
in
his
time
and
the
ingenious
translator
of
the
lusiad
of
camoens
is
of
opinion
that
some
of
his
commanders
passed
beyond
the
equator
according
to
mickle
it
was
the
custom
of
his
navigators
to
leave
his

seven
years
before
the

two
voyages
were
made
to
the
african
coast
by
alvise

a
venetian
navigator
under
the
auspices
of
the
duke
of
viseo
but
which
we
have
chosen
to
separate
from
the
historical
deduction
of
the
portuguese
discoveries
principally
because
they
contain
the
oldest
nautical
journal
extant
except
those
already
given
in
our
first
part
from
the
pen
of
the
great
alfred
and
are
therefore
peculiarly
valuable
in
a
work
of
this
nature
their
considerable
length
likewise
and
because
they
were
not
particularly
conducive
to
the
grand
object
of
extending
the
maritime
discoveries
have
induced
us
to
detach
them
from
the
foregoing
narrative
that
we
might
carry
it
down
unbroken
to
the
death
of
the
great
don
henry
these
voyages
likewise
give
us
an
early
picture
of
the
state
of
population
civilization
and
manners
of
the
africans
not
to
be
met
with
elsewhere
to
this
we
subjoin
an
abstract
of
the
narrative
of
a
voyage
made
by
pedro
de
cintra
a
portuguese
captain
to
the
coast
of
africa
drawn
up
for
cada
mosto
at
lagos
by
a
young
portuguese
who
had
been
his
secretary
and
who
had
accompanied
cintra
in
his
voyage
the
exact
date
of
this
voyage
is
nowhere
given
but
as
the
death
of
don
henry
is
mentioned
in
the
narrative
it
probably
took
place
in
that
year
so
called
from
the
number
of
hawks
which
were
seen
on

islands

afterwards
introduction
alvise
da
cada
mosto
a
venetian
in
the
service
of
don
henry
of
portugal
informs
us
in
his
preface
that
he
was
the
first
navigator
from
the
city
of
who
had
sailed
on
the
ocean
beyond
the
straits
of
gibraltar
to
the
southern
parts
of
negroland
and
lower
ethiopia
these
voyages
at
cada
mosto
are
the
oldest
extant
in
the
form
of
a
regular
journal
and
were
originally
composed
in
italian
and
first
printed
at
venice
in
this
first
edition
is
now
exceedingly
scarce
but
there
is
a
copy
in
the
kings
library
and
another
in
the
valuable
collection
made
by
mr
dalrymple
these
voyages
were
afterward
published
by
ramusio
in
and
by
grynæus
in
latin
the
latter
was
misled
in
regard
to
the
date
which
he
has
inadvertently
placed
in
after
the
death
of
prince
henry
and
even
subsequent
to
the
discovery
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
by
bernal
diaz
even
ramusio
in
his
introduction
to
the
voyages
of
cada
mosto
has
made
a
mistake
in
saying
that
they
were
undertaken
by
the
orders
of
john
king
of
portugal
who
died
in
ramusio
imagined
that
the
discoveries
of
cada
mosto
might
tend
to
great
importance
as
he
considered
the
rivers
senegal
and
rio
grande
to
be
branches
of
the
niger
by
which
means
the
europeans
might
open
a
trade
with
the
rich
kingdoms
of
tombuto
and
melli
on
that
river
and
thus
bring
gold
from
the
countries
of
the
negroes
by
an
easier
safer
and
more
expeditious
manner
than
as
conveyed
by
the
moors
of
barbary
by
land
over
the
vast
and
dangerous
deserts
that
intervene
between
the
country
on
the
niger
and
senegal
rivers
and
barbary
as
by
the
account
of
leo
salt
is
the
most
valuable
commodity
throughout
the
countries
of
the
negroes
ramusio
proposed
that
the
ships
should
take
in
cargoes
of
salt
at
the
island
of
one
of
the
cape
de
verds
and
thence
supply
the
countries
on
the
niger
which
was
reported
to
be
navigable
for
miles
into
the
interior
and
that
they
should
bring
back
gold
and
slaves
in
return
the
latter
to
be
brought
to
market
at
st
jago
another
of
the
cape
de
verd
islands
where
they
would
be
immediately
bought
up
for
the
west
indies
all
this
fine
speculation
however
rested
on
mistaken
foundations
as
the
niger
is
altogether
an
inland
river
running
to
the
east
and
has
no
communication
with
the
senegal
and
gambia
which
run
west
into
the
atlantic
yet
time
and
the
civilization
of
the
natives
on
the
senegal
and
gambia
may
hereafter
realize
this
scheme
of
a
valuable
traffic
into
the
interior
of
africa
but
it
is
fervently
to
be
hoped
that
the
trade
in
slaves
may
never
be
revived
in
his
preface
after
an
apology
for
his
performance
and
making
a
declaration
of
his
strict
adherence
to
truth
in
all
the
particulars
he
relates
cada
mosto
gives
some
account
of
the
infant
don
henriquez
or
henry
of
portugal
the
great
author
and
promoter
of
maritime
discoveries
he
praises
him
as
a
prince
of
a
great
soul
and
sublime
genius
and
of
great
skill
in
astronomy
and
adds
that
he
applied
himself
entirely
to
the
service
of
christ
by
making
war
against
the
moors
while
on
bed
in
don
john
king
of
portugal
exhorted
his
son
don
henry
to
pursue
his
laudable
and
holy
purpose
of
the
enemies
of
the
christian
faith
which
he
promised
to
perform
and
accordingly
with
the
assistance
of
his
brother
don
duarte
or
edward
who
succeeded
to
the
throne
of
portugal
he
made
war
in
fez
with
success
for
many
years
afterwards
the
more
effectually
to
harass
the
moors
he
used
to
send
his
caravels
or
ships
of
war
annually
to
scour
the
coasts
of
azafi
or
al
saffi
and
messa
on
the
coast
of
africa
without
the
mediteranean
by
which
he
did
them
much
damage
but
having
in
view
to
make
discoveries
along
that
western
coast
he
ordered
them
every
year
to
advance
farther
towards
the
south
they
accordingly
proceeded
till
they
came
to
a
great
cape
which
put
a
stop
to
their
progress
southwards
for
several
years
being
afraid
to
go
beyond
it
whence
it
took
the
name
it
still
retains
of
cape
non
meaning
that
such
as
went
beyond
should
never
return
don
henry
however
was
of
a
different
opinion
and
adding
three
other
caravels
to
those
which
had
been
at
the
cape
sent
them
again
next
year
to
make
the
attempt
they
accordingly
penetrated
about
miles
beyond
that
cape
where
they
found
only
a
sandy
coast
with
no
habitations
and
returned
back
to
portugal
encouraged
by
this
commencement
of
successful
progress
don
henry
sent
the
same
fleet
back
next
year
with
orders
to
extend
their
discoveries
miles
farther
to
the
south
and
even
more
if
they
found
it
proper
and
promised
to
enrich
all
who
should
embark
in
this
navigation
they
went
again
and
although
they
obeyed
the
instructions
of
the
prince
they
could
not
improve
the
discoveries
yet
firmly
persuaded
by
the
strength
of
his
own
judgment
that
people
and
habitations
would
certainly
be
found
at
length
don
henry
continued
to
send
out
his
caravels
from
time
to
time
and
they
came
at
length
to
certain
coasts
frequented
by
the
arabs
of
the
desert
and
to
the
habitations
of
the
azanaghi
a
tawny
race
thus
the
countries
of
the
negroes
were
discovered
and
different
nations
afterwards
which
will
be
mentioned
in
the
following
relation
thus
far
the
preface
of
cada

as
given
in
the
collection
of
astley
from
the
edition
of
ramusio
with
which
we
must
be
satisfied
in
this
work
as
that
in
the
royal
library
is
inaccessible
for
our
use
the
present
version
has
been
carefully
formed
by
a
comparison
of
astley
with
the
original
in
ramusio
and
with
the
summary
by
the
reverend
james
stanier
clarke
in
his
curious
work
on
the
progress
of
maritime
discoveries
which
only
gives
a
selection
of
what
he
considered
to
be
its
most
material
parts
in
this
edition
the
narrative
style
of
cada
mosto
in
his
own
person
is
restored
as
much
as
possible
it
may
be
noticed
that
alvise
is
the
portuguese
form
of
the
name
louis
or
lewis
in
addition
to
the
two
voyages
of
cada

himself
there
is
a
third
voyage
included
in
the
present
chapter
performed
by
piedro
de

to
the
same
coast
the
narrative
of
which
was
communicated
to
cada

by

who
had
accompanied

had
been

the

has
been
left
in

words

insisting
on
the
exactness
of

after
visiting
many
parts
of

mediterranean

being
in
our
city
of

in
the
year
at
which
time
i
was
about
years
of
age
determined
to
return
into
flanders
a
country
which
i
had
formerly
visited
as
a
merchant
for
my
constant
attention
was
in
the
first
place
to
acquire
wealth
and
secondly
to
procure
fame
on
the
of
august
in
that
year
i
embarked
in
one
of
the
gallies
belonging
to
the
republic
commanded
by
marco
zen
a
venetian
cavalier
contrary
winds
detained
us
for
some
days
off
cape
st
vincent
during
which
i
learnt
that
don
henry
the
infant
of
portugal
resided
in
the
adjoining
village
of
reposera
or
sagres
to
which
he
had
retired
in
order
to
pursue
his
studies
without
interruption
from
the
tumult
of
the
world
hearing
of
our
arrival
the
prince
sent
on
board
of
our
galley
antonio
gonzales
his
secretary
accompanied
by
patricio
de
conti
a
venetian
who
was
consul
for
the
republic
in
portugal
as
appeared
by
his
commission
and
who
also
received
a
salary
or
pension
from
don
henry
these
gentlemen
brought
on
board
and
exhibited
to
us
samples
of
madeira
sugar
dragons
blood
and
other
commodities
of
the
countries
and
islands
belonging
to
the
prince
which
had
been
discovered
under
his
patronage
they
asked
us
many
questions
and
informed
us
that
the
prince
had
caused
some
lately
discovered
and
uninhabited
islands
to
be
settled
and
cultivated
as
a
proof
of
which
they
had
shewn
us
the
valuable
productions
adding
that
all
this
was
next
to
nothing
in
comparison
of
the
great
things
which
don
henry
had
performed
as
he
had
discovered
seas
which
had
never
been
navigated
before
and
the
countries
of
divers
strange
and
hitherto
unknown
nations
where
many
wonderful
things
were
found
they
told
us
farther
that
the
portuguese
who
had
been
in
these
remote
parts
had
reaped
great
advantages
by
trading
with
the
inhabitants
having
gained
as
high
as
or
even
per
cent
on
the
capitals
employed
we
were
all
much
astonished
at
these
things
and
i
cada
mosto
in
particular
being
inflamed
with
the
desire
of
visiting
these
newly
discovered
regions
inquired
if
the
prince
permitted
any
person
who
might
be
so
inclined
to
embark
for
these
places
to
this
they
answered
in
the
affirmative
and
they
likewise
stated
to
me
the
conditions
on
which
any
one
would
be
allowed
to
make
the
adventure
these
were
either
to
be
at
the
whole
expence
of
fitting
out
and
freighting
a
vessel
or
at
the
expence
of
the
freight
only
the
prince
providing
a
vessel
in
the
former
case
the
adventurer
had
to
allow
on
his
return
one
quarter
of
his
cargo
as
duty
to
the
prince
the
rest
remaining
his
own
entire
propriety
in
the
latter
case
the
homeward
cargo
was
to
be
equally
divided
between
the
prince
and
the
adventurer
in
case
of
no
returns
the
prince
was
at
the
entire
expence
of
the
voyage
but
that
it
was
hardly
possible
to
make
the
voyage
without
great
profit
they
added
that
the
prince
would
be
much
pleased
to
have
any
venetian
in
his
service
and
would
shew
him
great
favour
being
of
opinion
that
spices
and
other
rich
merchandise
might
be
found
in
these
parts
and
knowing
that
the
venetians
understood
these
commodities
better
than
any
other
nation
influenced
by
all
this
i
accompanied
the
secretary
and
consul
on
shore
and
waited
on
the
prince
who
confirmed
all
those
things
which
they
had
said
and
encouraged
me
to
embark
in
the
voyage
to
his
new
countries
by
promises
of
honour
and
profit
being
young
and
of
a
constitution
to
endure
fatigue
and
desirous
to
visit
those
parts
of
the
world
which
had
never
been
even
known
to
any
venetian
and
likewise
in
hopes
to
advance
my
fortune
i
accepted
of
the
invitation
having
therefore
procured
information
respecting
the
commodities
which
it
was
proper
to
carry
with
me
on
such
a
voyage
i
returned
to
the
gallies
where
i
disposed
of
all
the
goods
i
had
shipped
for
the
low
countries
and
carried
to
land
such
things
as
were
necessary
for
my
intended
expedition
and
leaving
the
gallies
to
pursue
their
voyage
to
flanders
i
landed
in
portugal
the
prince
evinced
much
satisfaction
at
my
resolution
and
entertained
me
handsomely
at
sagres
for
a
considerable
time
at
length
he
ordered
me
to
fit
out
a
new
caravel
of
about
ninety
tons
burden
of
which
vincent
diaz
a
native
of
lagos
about
sixteen
miles
from
sagres
was
commander
the
caravel
being
in
readiness
and
furnished
with
every
thing
necessary
for
the
voyage
we
set
sail
on
the
of
march
having
a
favourable
wind
at
and
by
north
and
steered
our
course
for
the
island
of
madeira
on
the
of
that
month
we
came
to
the
island
of
which
is
about
miles
southward
from
cape
st
vincent
whence
we
took
our
departure
puerto
santo
was
discovered
by
the
portuguese
on
all
saints
day
about
the
year
and
don
henry
first
sent
inhabitants
to
settle
there
under
bartholomew
perestrello
whom
he
appointed
governor
it
is
about
fifteen
miles
in
circuit
it
bears
good
bread
corn
and
a
sufficiency
of
oats
for
its
own
use
and
abounds
with
cattle
and
wild
hogs
and
innumerable
rabbits
among
other
trees
it
produces
the
drago
or
dragon
tree
the
sap
or
juice
of
which
is
drawn
out
only
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
when
it
issues
from
cuts
or
clefts
made
with
an
axe
near
the
bottom
of
the
tree
in
the
preceding
year
these
clefts
are
found
full
of
a
kind
of
gum
which
decocted
and
depurated
is
the
blood
of
the
apothecaries
the
tree
bears
a
yellow
fruit
round
like
like
a
cherry
and
well
tasted
this
island
produces
the
best
honey
and
wax
in
the
world
but
not
in
any
quantity
it
has
no
harbour
but
a
good
road
in
which
vessels
may
moor
in
safety
being
well
sheltered
on
all
sides
except
the
quarters
between
the
south
and
east
all
of
which
winds
make
it
unsafe
to
ride
here
at
anchor
there
is
plenty
of
excellent
fish
on
its
shores
such
as
dentili
gilded
fish
and
others
from
puerto
santo
which
was
discovered
years
before
we
sailed
on
the
of
march
and
came
the
same
day
to
or
machico
one
of
the
ports
of
the
island
of
madeira
forty
miles
distant
from
puerto
santo
in
fair
weather
these
islands
may
be
seen
from
each
other
this
latter
island
was
only
inhabited
within
the
last
years
when
the
prince
appointed
two
of
his
gentlemen
to
be
its
governors
tristan
vaz
having
the
government
of
that
half
of
the
island
in
which
the
port
of
monchrico
is
situated
and
the
other
district
of
the
island
in
which
fonzal
fonchial
or
funchal
stands
is
under
the
government
of
john
gonzales
zarcho
the
island
of
madeira
is
inhabited
in
four
several
places
monchrico
santa
cruz
fonzal
and
which
are
its
principal
places
though
there
are
other
minor
establishments
and
is
able
to
muster
about
men
able
to
bear
arms
of
whom
an
hundred
are
horse
there
are
about
eight
rivers
which
pervade
the
island
in
different
places
by
means
of
which
they
have
many
from
which
portugal
and
other
places
are
supplied
with
boards
of
many
different
sorts
of
these
boards
two
sorts
are
in
particular
estimation
and
turn
most
to
account
the
one
is
cedar
which
has
a
strong
odoriferous
smell
and
resembles
the
cypress
tree
of
this
they
make
fine
large
and
long
boards
or
deals
which
they
employ
for
building
houses
and
for
various
other
purposes
the
other
called
nasso
is
of
a
colour
and
extremely
beautiful
of
which
they
make
excellent
and
very
beautiful
bows
and
which
are
sent
into
the
west
in
order
to
clear
the
land
the
first
settlers
set
fire
to
the
woods
and
the
fire
spread
with
such
fury
that
several
persons
with
their
families
and
gonzales
zarcho
among
the
rest
were
forced
to
take
shelter
in
the
sea
to
save
themselves
from
the
flames
where
they
stood
up
to
their
necks
for
two
days
and
two
nights
without
sustenance
though
this
island
is
mountainous
its
soil
is
rich
and
fertile
and
it
produces
yearly
venetian
of
bread
corn
at
first
the
newly
cultivated
land
yielded
seventy
for
one
but
has
since
been
reduced
to
thirty
or
forty
for
want
of
good
husbandry
owing
to
the
excellence
of
its
soil
and
climate
and
the
abundance
of
springs
and
rivers
prince
henry
procured
sugar
canes
from
sicily
which
he
sent
to
this
island
where
they
have
yielded
abundant
produce
insomuch
that
cantaros
of
sugar
each
containing
pounds
large
weight
of
venice
have
been
made
at
one
boiling
and
the
quantity
was
likely
to
increase
they
have
likewise
good
wines
considering
how
shortly
this
culture
has
been
introduced
and
in
such
abundance
that
large
quantities
are
exported
among
other
kinds
of
vines
don
henry
sent
thither
plants
procured
from
the
island
of
candia
which
have
succeeded
well
the
soil
has
turned
out
so
favourable
for
the
vine
that
in
general
there
are
more
grapes
than
leaves
and
the
bundles
are
very
large
even
from
two
to
four
spans
long
they
have
likewise
the
black
grape
without
stones
in
great
perfection
and
so
well
is
the
climate
adapted
to
this
culture
that
they
begin
their
vintage
about
easter
or
at
least
by
the
octave
after
we
sailed
from
madeira
following
a
southerly
course
and
arrived
at
the
canary
islands
which
are
at
the
distance
of
about
miles
from
madeira
there
are
seven
of
these
islands
in
all
four
of
which
have
been
settled
by
the
christians
lançerotta
fuerteventura
gomera
and
ferro
over
which
herrera
a
spanish
gentleman
is
lord
large
quantities
of
an
herb
called
or
orchel
are
annually
sent
from
these
islands
to
cadiz
and
seville
which
is
used
in
dying
and
is
sent
from
these
places
to
all
parts
of
europe
great
quantities
of
excellent
goat
skins
are
exported
from
these
islands
which
likewise
produce
abundance
of
tallow
and
good
cheese
the
original
inhabitants
of
the
four
islands
that
are
subject
to
the
christians
are
who
speak
various
languages
or
dialects
not
well
understood
between
the
different
tribes
these
people
have
only
open
villages
without
any
fortifications
except
on
the
mountains
which
are
exceedingly
high
and
there
they
have
a
kind
of
rude
walls
or
redoubts
to
flee
to
in
case
of
need
the
passes
of
these
mountains
are
so
difficult
of
access
that
a
few
resolute
men
might
defend
them
against
an
army
the
other
three
islands
of
this
group
grand
canaria
teneriffe
and
palma
which
are
larger
and
better
peopled
than
the
other
four
are
still
unsubdued
and
possessed
by
the
aboriginal
idolaters
grand
canaria
has
between
eight
and
nine
thousand
souls
and
teneriffe
which
is
the
largest
of
all
these
islands
is
said
to
contain
fourteen
or
fifteen
thousand
and
is
divided
into
nine
separate
lordships
palma
however
has
very
few
inhabitants
yet
it
appears
to
be
a
very
beautiful
island
every
lordship
seems
to
have
its
own
mode
of
religious
worship
as
in
teneriffe
there
were
no
less
than
nine
different
kinds
of
idolatry
some
worshipping
the
sun
others
the
moon
and
so
forth
they
practise
polygamy
and
the
lords
have
the
jus
primae
noctis
which
is
considered
as
conferring
great
honour
on
the
accession
of
any
new
lord
it
is
customary
for
some
persons
to
offer
themselves
to
die
as
a
sacrifice
to
his
honour
on
this
occasion
the
lord
holds
a
great
festival
on
his
accession
day
when
all
who
are
willing
to
give
this
cruel
proof
of
their
attachment
are
attended
to
the
summit
of
a
high
cliff
in
a
certain
valley
where
after
some
peculiar
ceremonies
and
certain
words
muttered
over
them
the
victims
precipitate
themselves
from
the
cliff
and
are
dashed
to
pieces
in
reward
of
this
sanguinary
homage
the
lords
consider
themselves
bound
to
heap
extraordinary
honours
and
rewards
on
the
parents
of
the
victims
teneriffe
which
is
the
largest
of
these
islands
and
the
best
inhabited
is
one
of
highest
islands
in
the
world
and
is
seen
in
clear
weather
from
a
great
distance
insomuch
that
i
was
informed
by
some
mariners
that
it
had
been
descried
at
the
distance
of
between
sixty
and
seventy
spanish
leagues
which
make
about
italian
miles
in
the
middle
of
the
island
there
is
a
prodigiously
high
peaked
mountain
shaped
like
a
diamond
which
is
always
burning
i
received
this
account
from
some
christians
who
had
been
prisoners
in
the
island
who
affirmed
that
it
was
fifteen
portuguese
leagues
or
sixty
italian
miles
from
the
bottom
of
the
mountain
to
the
top
of
the
peak
they
have
nine
lords
on
this
island
who
are
called
dukes
and
who
do
not
succeed
by
inheritance
or
descent
but
by
force
on
which
account
they
have
perpetual
civil
wars
among
themselves
in
which
they
commit
great
slaughter
their
only
weapons
are
stones
maces
or
clubs
and
darts
or
lances
some
of
which
are
pointed
with
horn
and
others
have
their
points
hardened
in
the
fire
they
all
go
naked
except
a
few
who
wear
goat
skins
before
and
behind
they
anoint
their
skins
with
goats
tallow
mixed
up
with
the
juice
of
certain
herbs
which
thickens
the
skin
and
defends
them
against
the
cold
of
which
they
complain
much
although
their
country
is
so
far
to
the
south
they
have
neither
walled
nor
thatched
houses
but
dwell
in
grottos
and
caverns
of
the
mountains
they
feed
on
barley
flesh
and
goats
milk
of
which
they
have
abundance
and
some
fruits
particularly
figs
as
the
country
is
very
hot
they
reap
their
corn
in
april
and
may
we
learnt
all
these
things
from
the
christians
of
the
four
settled
islands
who
sometimes
go
over
by
night
to
the
three
other
islands
and
make
prisoners
of
the
natives
whom
they
send
into
spain
to
be
sold
as
slaves
sometimes
the
spaniards
are
themselves
made
prisoners
on
these
expeditions
on
which
occasions
the
natives
do
not
put
them
to
death
but
employ
them
to
kill
and
flea
their
goats
and
to
cure
the
flesh
which
they
look
upon
as
a
vile
employment
and
therefore
condemn
their
christian
prisoners
to
that
labour
in
contempt
the
native
canarians
are
very
active
and
nimble
and
are
exceedingly
agile
in
running
and
leaping
being
accustomed
to
traverse
the
cliffs
of
their
rugged
mountains
they
skip
barefooted
from
rock
to
rock
like
goats
and
sometimes
take
leaps
of
most
surprising
extent
and
danger
which
are
scarcely
to
be
believed
they
throw
stones
with
great
strength
and
wonderful
exactness
so
as
to
hit
whatever
they
aim
at
with
almost
perfect
certainty
and
almost
with
the
force
of
a
bullet
from
a
musket
insomuch
that
a
few
stones
thrown
by
them
will
break
a
buckler
to
pieces
i
once
saw
a
native
canarian
who
had
become
a
christian
who
offered
to
give
three
persons
twelve
oranges
and
taking
twelve
to
himself
engaged
at
eight
or
ten
paces
distance
to
strike
his
antagonists
with
every
one
of
his
oranges
and
at
the
same
time
to
parry
all
theirs
so
that
they
should
hit
no
part
of
him
but
his
hands
but
no
one
would
take
up
the
wager
as
they
all
knew
he
could
perform
even
better
than
he
mentioned
i
was
on
land
in
gomera
and
ferro
and
touched
also
at
the
island
of
palma
but
did
not
land
there

of

with
some
account
of
the
arabs
the
azanaghi
and
the
country
of
leaving
the
canaries
we
pursued
our
course
towards
ethiopia
and
arrived
in
a
few
days
at
cape
branco
which
is
about
miles
from
these
islands
in
this
passage
steering
south
we
kept
at
a
great
distance
from
the
african
shore
on
our
left
as
the
canaries
are
into
the
sea
towards
the
west
we
stood
almost
directly
south
for
of
the
way
between
the
islands
and
the
cape
after
which
we
changed
our
course
somewhat
more
towards
the
east
or
that
we
might
fall
in
with
the
land
lest
we
should
have
overpassed
the
cape
without
seeing
it
because
no
land
appears
afterwards
so
far
to
the
west
for
a
considerable
space
the
coast
of
africa
to
the
southwards
of
cape
bronco
falls
in
considerably
to
the
eastwards
forming
a
great
bay
or
gulf
called
the
of
from
a
small
island
of
that
name
this
gulf
extends
about
fifty
miles
into
the
land
and
has
three
other
islands
one
of
which
is
named
by
the
portuguese
or
the
white
island
on
account
of
its
white
sands
the
second
is
called
or
the
isle
of
herons
where
they
found
so
many
eggs
of
certain
seabirds
as
to
load
two
boats
the
third
is
called
or
cori
these
islands
are
all
small
sandy
and
uninhabited
in
that
of
arguin
there
is
plenty
of
fresh
water
but
there
is
none
in
any
of
the
others
it
is
proper
to
observe
that
on
keeping
to
the
southwards
from
the
straits
of
gibraltar
the
coast
of
exterior
barbary
is
inhabited
no
farther
than
cape
cantin
from
whence
to
cape
branco
is
the
sandy
country
or
desert
called
or
by
the
natives
which
is
divided
from
barbary
or
morocco
on
the
north
by
the
mountains
of
atlas
and
borders
on
the
south
with
the
country
of
the
negroes
and
would
require
a
journey
of
fifty
days
to
cross
in
some
places
more
in
others
less
this
desert
reaches
to
the
ocean
and
is
all
a
white
dry
sand
quite
low
and
level
so
that
no
part
of
it
seems
higher
than
any
other
cape
or
the
white
cape
so
named
by
the
portuguese
from
its
white
colour
without
trees
or
verdure
is
a
noble
promontory
of
a
triangular
shape
having
three
separate
points
about
a
mile
from
each
other
innumerable
quantities
of
large
and
excellent
fish
of
various
kinds
are
caught
on
this
coast
similar
in
taste
to
those
we
have
at
venice
but
quite
different
in
shape
and
appearance
the
gulf
of
arguin
is
shallow
all
over
and
is
full
of
shoals
both
of
rocks
and
sand
and
as
the
currents
are
here
very
strong
there
is
no
sailing
except
by
day
and
even
then
with
the
lead
constantly
heaving
two
ships
have
been
already
lost
on
these
shoals
cape
lies
of
cape
cantin
or
rather
and
by
behind
cape
branco
there
is
a
place
called
hoden
six
days
journey
inland
on
camels
which
is
not
walled
but
is
much
frequented
by
the
arabs
and
caravans
which
trade
between
tombucto
and
other
places
belonging
to
the
negroes
and
the
western
parts
of
barbary
the
provisions
at
hoden
are
dates
and
barley
which
they
have
in
plenty
and
the
inhabitants
drink
the
milk
of
camels
and
other
animals
as
they
have
no
wine
they
have
some
cows
and
goats
the
former
being
greatly
smaller
than
those
of
italy
but
the
number
of
these
is
not
great
as
the
country
is
very
dry
the
inhabitants
are
all
mahometans
and
great
enemies
to
the
christians
and
have
no
settled
habitations
but
wander
continually
over
the
deserts
they
frequent
the
country
of
the
negroes
and
visit
that
side
of
barbary
which
is
next
the
mediterranean
on
these
expeditions
they
travel
in
numerous
caravans
with
great
trains
of
camels
carrying
brass
silver
and
other
articles
to
tombucto
and
the
country
of
the
negroes
whence
they
bring
back
gold
and
or
cardamom
seeds
these
people
are
all
of
a
tawny
colour
and
both
sexes
wear
a
single
white
garment
with
a
red
border
without
any

next
their

the
men
wear
turbans
in
the
moorish
fashion
and
go
always
barefooted
in
the

there
are
many
lions

built
on
the
isle
of
arguin
by
order
of
the
prince
to
protect
this
trade
on
account
of
which
caravels
or
ships
arrive
there
every
year
from
portugal
the
arabs
of
this
coast
have
many
barbary
horses
which
they
carry
to
the
country
of
the
negroes
which
they
barter
with
the
great
men
for
slaves
receiving
from
ten
to
eighteen
men
for
each
horse
according
to
their
goodness
they
also
carry
thither
silken
staffs
of
granada
and
tunis
with
silver
and
many
other
things
in
return
for
which
they
receive
great
numbers
of
slaves
and
some
gold
these
slaves
are
brought
first
to
hoden
in
the
desert
and
thence
by
the
mountains
of
barka
into
barbary
whence
they
are
transported
across
the
mediterranean
into
sicily
part
of
them
are
sold
in
tunis
and
in
other
places
along
the
coast
of
barbary
and
the
rest
are
brought
to
arguin
where
they
are
sold
to
the
licensed
portuguese
traders
who
purchase
between
seven
and
eight
hundred
every
year
and
send
them
for
sale
into
portugal
before
the
establishment
of
this
trade
at
arguin
the
portuguese
used
to
send
every
year
four
or
more
caravels
to
the
bay
of
arguin
the
crews
of
which
landing
well
armed
in
the
night
were
in
use
to
surprise
some
of
the
fishing
villages
and
carry
off
the
inhabitants
into
slavery
they
even
penetrated
sometimes
a
considerable
way
into
the
interior
and
carried
off
the
arabs
of
both
sexes
whom
they
sold
as
slaves
in
portugal
leaving
arguin
we
sailed
along
the
coast
to
the
river
senegal
which
is
very
large
and
divides
the
people
called
azanaghi
or
azanhaji
from
the
first
kingdom
of
the
negroes
the
azanhaji
are
of
a
tawny
colour
or
rather
of
a
deep
brown
complexion
and
inhabit
some
parts
of
the
coast
beyond
cape
branco
ranging
through
the
deserts
and
their
district
reaches
to
the
confines
of
the
arabs
of
hoden
they
live
on
dates
barley
and
the
milk
of
camels
but
as
they
border
likewise
on
the
country
of
the
negroes
they
carry
on
trade
with
these
people
from
whom
they
procure
millet
and
pulse
particularly
beans
owing
to
the
scarcity
of
provisions
in
the
desert
the
azanhaji
are
but
spare
eaters
and
are
able
to
endure
hunger
with
wonderful
patience
as
a
poringer
of
made
into
will
serve
them
a
whole
day
the
portuguese
used
to
carry
away
many
of
these
people
for
slaves
as
they
were
preferred
to
the
negroes
but
for
some
time
past
this
has
been
prohibited
by
don
henry
and
peace
and
trade
has
been
established
with
them
as
he
is
in
hopes
they
may
be
easily
brought
over
to
the
catholic
faith
by
intercourse
with
the
christians
more
especially
as
they
are
not
hitherto
thoroughly
established
in
the
superstitions
of
mahomet
of
which
they
know
nothing
but
by
hearsay
these
azenhaji
have
an
odd
custom
of
wearing
a
handkerchief
round
their
heads
a
part
of
which
is
brought
down
so
as
to
cover
their
eyes
and
even
their
nose
and
mouth
for
they
reckon
the
mouth
an
unclean
part
because
it
is
constantly
belching
and
has
a
bad
smell
and
ought
therefore
to
be
kept
out
of
sight
even
comparing
it
to
the
posteriors
and
thinking
that
both
ought
alike
to
be
concealed
on
this
account
they
never
let
their
mouths
be
seen
except
when
eating
as
i
have
often
had
occasion
to
observe
they
have
no
lords
among
them
but
the
rich
men
are
respected
somewhat
more
than
the
rest
they
are
of
ordinary
stature
and
very
lean
wearing
their
black
hair
frizzled
over
their
shoulders
like
the
germans
and
grease
it
daily
with
fish
oil
which
gives
them
a
nasty
smell
yet
they
consider
this
as
modish
they
are
extremely
poor
egregious
liars
the
greatest
thieves
in
the
world
and
very
treacherous
they
have
never
heard
of
any
christians
except
the
portuguese
with
whom
they
had
war
for
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
in
which
many
of
them
were
carried
off
as
slaves
as
has
been
already
mentioned
many
of
these
people
informed
me
that
when
they
first
saw
ships
under
sail
which
had
never
been
beheld
by
any
of
their
ancestors
they
took
them
for
large
birds
with
white
wings
that
had
come
from
foreign
parts
and
when
the
sails
were
furled
they
conjectured
from
their
length
and
swimming
on
the
water
that
they
must
be
great
fish
others
again
believed
that
they
were
spirits
who
wandered
about
by
night
because
they
were
seen
at
anchor
in
the
evening
at
one
place
and
would
be
seen
next
morning
miles
off
either
proceeding
along
the
coast
to
the
southwards
or
put
back
according
as
the
wind
changed
or
the
caravels
might
happen
to
steer
they
could
not
conceive
how
human
beings
could
travel
more
in
one
night
than
they
were
able
to
perform
themselves
in
three
days
by
which
they
were
confirmed
in
the
notion
of
the
ships
being
spirits
all
this
was
certified
to
me
by
many
of
the
azanhaji
who
were
slaves
in
portugal
as
well
as
by
the
portuguese
mariners
who
had
frequented
the
coast
in
their
caravels
about
six
days
journey
by
land
from
hoden
there
is
a
place
called
teggazza
which
in
our
language
signifies
a
chest
or
bag
of
gold
in
this
place
large
quantities
of
salt
are
dug
up
every
year
and
carried
by
caravans
on
camels
to
and
thence
to
the
empire
of
which
belongs
to
the
negroes
oh
arriving
there
they
dispose
of
their
salt
in
the
course
of
eight
days
at
the
rate
of
between
two
and
three
hundred
or
ducats
for
each
load
according
to
the
quantity
and
then
return
with
their
gold
this
is
erroneous
as
there
are
several
towns
on
the
coast
of
morocco
beyond
this
cape
as
saffia
mogadore
santa
cruz
and
others
cape
cantin
is
in
lat
and
the
river
in
which
is
miles
to
the
south
there
are
no
towns
on
the
coast
beyond
that
river
but
the
northern
limit
of
the
or
great
desert
is
in
lat
miles
to
the
south
of
the
river
and
is
surely
inhabited
by
wandering
arabs
even
the
great
desert
which
extends
miles
from
north
to
south
almost
to
the
river
senegal
is
thinly
interspersed
by
several
wandering
tribes
of
the

tombuto

the
original

in
an

watered
island
in
the

or
great

lat
and
long

the
general
name
of

probably
signifies

or
wanderers
of

desert
the
nomadic

are
distinguished
into
various
tribes
as

named

to

as
occupying
the
desert
towards
the

in
the
text
this
river
is
named
senega
and
its
name
probably
signifies
the
river
of
the
azanhaji
it
is
called
in
ramusio
f
the
name
of
this
place
is
explained
as
signifying
a
chest
or
bag
of
gold
there
is
a
place
marked
in
the
saharra
or
great
sandy
desert
under
the
name
of

there
are
salt
mines
in
lat
and
long
which
may
possibly
be
teggazza
the
distance
of
tisheet
from
hoden
in
our
maps
is
about
miles
but
there
are
other
salt
mines
in
the
desert
still
farther
to
the
east
section
iii
the
empire
of
melli
and
some
curious
particulars
of
the
salt
trade
of
the
trade
in
gold
of
the
azanhaji
and
concerning
swarms
of
the
empire
of
melli
of
which
some
mention
has
been
made
in
the
preceding
section
is
situated
in
an
extremely
hot
climate
and
affords
very
bad
nourishment
for
beasts
insomuch
that
out
of
an
hundred
camels
which
go
from
the
desert
into
that
country
scarcely
return
several
even
of
the
arabs
and
azanhaji
belonging
to
the
caravans
sicken
and
die
likewise
every
year
there
are
no
quadrupeds
kept
by
the
natives
of
the
country
as
indeed
none
can
live
there
for
any
time
it
is
reckoned
to
be
forty
days
journey
on
horseback
from
tegazza
to
tombuctu
and
thirty
from
thence
to
melli
having
inquired
what
use
the
merchants
of
melli
made
of
this
salt
the
traders
of
the
desert
informed
me
that
a
part
of
it
was
consumed
in
that
country
which
lying
near
the
line
where
the
days
and
nights
are
of
equal
length
certain
seasons
of
the
year
are
so
excessively
hot
that
the
blood
of
the
inhabitants
would
putrify
if
it
were
not
for
the
salt
and
they
would
all
die
they
have
no
art
or
mystery
in
its
use
but
every
one
dissolves
a
small
piece
every
day
in
a
porringer
of
water
and
drinks
it
off
which
in
their
opinion
preserves
their
health
the
remainder
of
the
salt
is
carried
a
long
way
in
pieces
on
mens
heads
every
piece
being
as
large
as
a
man
can
well
bear
as
brought
from
teggazza
the
salt
is
in
large
pieces
as
taken
out
of
the
mine
each
camel
being
loaded
with
two
pieces
and
the
negroes
break
these
down
into
smaller
pieces
for
the
convenience
of
carrying
them
on
their
heads
and
muster
a
large
number
of
footmen
for
this
yearly
traffic
these
porters
have
each
a
long
forked
stick
in
their
hands
and
when
tired
they
rest
their
loads
on
these
sticks
they
proceed
in
this
manner
till
they
arrive
on
the
banks
of
a
certain
water
but
whether
fresh
or
salt
my
informer
could
not
say
yet
i
am
of
opinion
that
it
must
be
a
river
because
if
it
were
the
sea
the
inhabitants
could
not
be
in
want
of
salt
in
so
hot
a
climate
the
negroes
are
hired
to
carry
it
in
this
manner
for
want
of
camels
or
other
beasts
of
burden
as
already
mentioned
and
from
what
has
been
said
it
may
easily
be
concluded
that
the
number
both
of
the
carriers
and
consumers
must
be
very
great
when
arrived
at
the
water
side
the
proprietors
of
the
salt
place
their
shares
in
heaps
in
a
row
at
small
distances
setting
each
a
particular
mark
on
his
own
heap
and
when
this
is
done
the
whole
company
retires
half
a
days
journey
from
the
place
then
the
other
negroes
who
are
the
purchasers
of
the
salt
who
seem
to
be
the
inhabitants
of
certain
islands
but
who
will
on
no
account
be
seen
or
spoken
to
come
in
boats
to
the
place
where
the
heaps
of
salt
are
placed
and
after
laying
a
sum
in
gold
on
each
heap
as
its
price
retire
in
their
turns
after
they
are
gone
the
owners
of
the
salt
return
and
if
the
quantity
of
gold
on
their
heaps
is
satisfactory
to
them
they
take
it
away
and
leave
the
salt
if
not
they
leave
both
and
withdraw
again
in
this
manner
they
carry
on
their
traffick
without
seeing
or
speaking
to
each
other
and
this
custom
is
very
ancient
among
them
as
has
been
affirmed
to
me
for
truth
by
several
merchants
of
the
desert
both
arabs
and
azanhaji
and
other
creditable
persons
on
inquiring
how
it
came
to
pass
that
the
emperor
of
melli
whom
they
represented
as
a
powerful
sovereign
did
not
find
means
by
friendship
or
force
to
discover
who
these
people
were
who
would
not
suffer
themselves
to
be
seen
or
talked
to
i
was
informed
that
this
emperor
not
many
years
ago
resolved
to
procure
some
of
these
invisible
people
and
held
a
council
on
the
occasion
in
which
the
following
plan
was
devised
and
carried
into
execution
before
the
salt
caravan
returned
the
half
days
journey
from
their
salt
heaps
some
of
the
emperors
people
made
certain
pits
by
the
water
side
and
near
the
place
where
the
salt
was
left
and
when
the
negroes
came
to
deposit
their
gold
on
the
salt
those
who
were
concealed
in
the
pits
attacked
them
suddenly
and
took
four
of
them
prisoners
all
the
rest
making
their
escape
three
of
those
who
were
thus
taken
were
immediately
set
free
by
the
captors
who
judged
that
one
would
be
quite
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
curiosity
of
their
emperor
and
that
the
negroes
would
be
the
less
offended
but
after
all
the
design
proved
abortive
for
though
spoken
to
in
various
languages
the
prisoner
would
neither
speak
or
take
any
victuals
and
died
at
the
end
of
four
days
on
this
account
the
melli
negroes
concluded
that
these
other
negroes
were
dumb
but
others
were
of
opinion
that
being
endowed
with
the
human
form
they
must
necessarily
have
the
power
of
speech
but
that
finding
himself
treated
in
this
manner
so
contrary
to
ancient
custom
he
refused
to
speak
from
indignation
this
untoward
result
was
much
regretted
by
the
negroes
of
melli
because
it
prevented
them
from
gratifying
the
curiosity
of
their
emperor
who
on
being
informed
of
this
persons
death
was
much
dissatisfied
yet
asked
what
manner
of
men
the
prisoners
were
he
was
accordingly
informed
that
they
were
of
a
deep
black
colour
well
shaped
and
a
span
taller
than
the
natives
of
melli
that
their
under
lip
was
thicker
than
a
mans
fist
of
a
very
red
colour
and
hung
down
on
their
breasts
with
something
like
blood
dropping
from
it
but
that
their
upper
lips
were
small
like
those
of
other
men
that
the
form
of
the
under
lip
exposed
their
gums
and
teeth
which
were
larger
than
their
own
having
great
teeth
in
each
corner
of
their
mouth
with
large
black
eyes
and
altogether
a
terrible
appearance
as
the
gums
dropped
blood
continually
as
well
as
the
great
hanging
under
lip
this
cross
accident
prevented
all
the
succeeding
emperors
of
melli
from
making
any
farther
attempt
of
the
kind
because
from
that
time
these
negroes
forbore
for
three
years
from
coming
to
buy
salt
as
usual
it
is
believed
that
their
lips
began
to
putrify
through
the
excessive
heat
of
the
climate
and
being
no
longer
able
to
endure
a
distemper
of
which
some
must
have
died
for
want
of
the
effectual
remedy
which
they
had
experienced
from
the
use
of
salt
they
returned
of
their
own
accord
to
traffic
for
that
commodity
in
the
old
way
all
this
has
established
an
opinion
that
they
can
not
live
without
salt
the
negroes
of
melli
judging
of
the
case
of
others
by
their
own
as
for
the
emperor
of
melli
he
cares
not
whether
these
blacks
will
speak
and
be
seen
or
not
so
that
that
he
has
the
profit
of
their
gold
this
is
all
i
could
learn
on
this
subject
which
i
think
may
be
credited
as
so
many
persons
have
vouched
for
its
truth
of
which
i
who
have
both
seen
and
heard
of
many
wonderful
things
in
this
world
am
perfectly
satisfied
the
gold
brought
to
melli
is
divided
into
three
parts
one
part
is
sent
by
the
caravan
which
goes
annually
from
melli
to
which
lies
on
the
road
to
syria
and
cairo
the
other
two
parts
go
first
to
tombuctu
whence
one
of
them
goes
by
to
tunis
and
other
ports
of
the
barbary
coast
and
the
other
portion
is
carried
to
hoden
and
from
thence
to
and
towns
in
barbary
which
are
within
the
straits
of
gibraltar
and
to
fez
morocco
arzila
azafi
and
messa
towns
on
the
african
coast
of
the
atlantic
where
the
italians
and
other
christians
procure
it
from
the
moors
in
return
for
various
commodities
gold
is
the
best
and
principal
commodity
which
comes
through
the
country
of
the
azanhaji
and
a
part
of
it
is
brought
every
year
from
hoden
to
arguin
where
it
is
bartered
with
the
portuguese
no
money
is
coined
in
the
land
of
the
or
azenhaji
nor
is
any
money
used
by
them
or
in
any
of
the
neighbouring
countries
but
all
their
trade
is
carried
on
by
bartering
one
commodity
against
another
in
some
of
their
inland
towns
the
arabs
and
azanbaji
use

of

wear

tie

very
tight
around

which
presses
very
hard
and
breaks
them
so
that
they
hang
down

by
pulling
at
these
cords
frequently
they
grow
longer

the

they
have
are

it
only
rains
in
the
months
of
august
september
and
october
i
was
informed
that
vast
swarms
of
locusts
appear
in
this
country
some
years
in
such
infinite
numbers
as
to
darken
the
air
and
even
to
hide
the
sun
from
view
covering
the
horizon
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
which
is
from
twelve
to
sixteen
miles
in
compass
and
wherever
they
settle
they
strip
the
ground
entirely
bare
these
locusts
are
like
grasshoppers
as
long
as
ones
finger
and
of
a
red
and
yellow
colour
they
come
every
third
or
fourth
year
and
if
they
were
to
pay
their
visits
every
year
there
would
be
no
living
in
the
country
while
i
was
on
the
coast
i
saw
them
in
prodigious
and
incredible
numbers
the
distance
between
tisheet
and
tombuctu
according
to
our
best
maps
is
about
miles
and
by
in
the
same
proportion
supposing
tisheet
to
be
teggazza
the
distance
between
tombuctu
and
melli
ought
to
be
about
miles
of
melli
we
have
no
traces
in
our
modern
maps
but
it
may
possibly
be
referred
to
the
apparent
capital
of
lamlem
see
pinkert
geogr
ii
as
laid
down
from
the
arabian
geographers
nearly
miles
from
e
this
story
is
probably
a
fiction
proceeding
upon
a
trade
of
barter
between
parties
who
did
not
understand
the
languages
of
each
other
the
succeeding
part
of
the
story
seems
a
mere
fable
without
the
smallest
foundation
e
few
persons
perhaps
will
be
disposed
to
think
the
credit
of
the
africans
however
positive
or
the
belief
of
the
author
however
strong
sufficient
evidence
of
the
truth
of
this
story
yet
it
certainly
is
a
common
report
of
the
country
and
not
the
invention
of
cada
mosto
jobson
who
was
at
the
gambra
or
gambia
in
repeats
the
whole
substance
of
this
story
and
movette
relates
the
circumstances
of
the
blacks
trafficking
for
salt
without
being
seen
which
he
had
from
the
moors
of
morocco
he
leaves
out
however
the
story
of
the
frightful
lips
every
fiction
has
its
day
and
that
part
is
now
out
of
astl
melli
being
itself
unknown
we
can
hardly
look
to
discover
the
situation
of
kokhia
or
cochia
but
it
may
possibly
be
kuku
a
town
and
district
to
the
of
bornou
which
lies
in
the
direction
of
the
text
or
it
may
be
dar
kulla
greatly
more
to
the
but
still
in
the
same
e
in
grynaeus
this
place
is
called
ato
as
in
the
direction
of
the
caravan
from
tombuto
towards
tunis
it
may
possibly
be
taudeny
an
ouasis
or
island
of
the
great
desert
in
lat
called
hona
in
grynaeus
what
part
of
barbary
this
name
may
refer
to
does
not
appear
but
the
passage
ought
perhaps
to
run
thus
oran
by
the
mountain
of
as
there
is
a
range
mountains
of
that
name
to
the
of
oran
which
joins
the
chain
of
atlas
or
the
ammer
e
this
is
the
earliest
account
of
the
places
from
whence
gold
is
brought
and
of
the
course
of
its
trade
through
africa
and
thence
into
europe
and
is
even
more
particular
and
exact
than
any
that
has
been
given
by
later
astl
section
iv
the
river
senegal
and
the
jalofs
with
some
account
of
the
manners
customs
government
religion
and
dress
of
that
leaving
cape
branco
and
the
gulf
of
arguin
we
continued
our
course
along
the
coast
to
the
river
senegal
which
divides
the
desert
and
the
tawny
azanhaji
from
the
fruitful
lands
of
the
negroes
five
years
before
i
went
on
this
voyage
this
river
was
discovered
by
three
caravels
belonging
to
don
henry
which
entered
it
and
their
commanders
settled
peace
and
trade
with
the
moors
since
which
time
ships
have
been
sent
to
this
place
every
year
to
trade
with
the
natives
the
river
senegal
is
of
considerable
size
being
a
mile
wide
at
the
mouth
and
of
sufficient
depth
a
little
farther
on
it
has
another
entrance
and
between
the
two
there
is
an
island
which
forms
a
cape
running
into
the
sea
having
banks
at
each
mouth
that
extend
a
mile
from
the
shore
all
ships
that
frequent
the
senegal
ought
carefully
to
observe
the
course
of
the
tides
the
flux
and
reflux
of
which
extend
for
seventy
miles
up
the
river
as
i
was
informed
by
certain
portuguese
who
had
been
a
great
way
up
this
river
with
their
caravels
from
cape
branco
which
is
miles
distant
the
whole
coast
is
sandy
till
within
twenty
miles
of
the
river
this
is
called
the
coast
of
and
belongs
entirely
to
the
azanhaji
or
tawny
moors
i
was
quite
astonished
to
find
so
prodigious
a
difference
in
so
narrow
a
space
as
appeared
at
the
senegal
for
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
the
inhabitants
are
all
exceedingly
black
tall
corpulent
and
well
proportioned
and
the
country
all
clothed
in
fine
verdure
and
full
of
fruit
trees
whereas
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
the
men
are
tawny
meagre
and
of
small
stature
and
the
country
all
dry
and
barren
this
river
in
the
opinion
of
the
learned
is
a
branch
of
the
which
flows
from
the
terrestrial
paradise
and
was
named
the
niger
by
the
ancients
which
flows
through
the
whole
of
ethiopia
and
which
on
approaching
the
ocean
to
the
west
divides
into
many
other
branches
the
which
is
another
branch
of
the
gihon
falls
into
the
mediterranean
after
flowing
through
egypt
the
first
kingdom
of
the
negroes
is
on
the
banks
of
the
senegal
and
its
inhabitants
are
called
or
jalofs
all
the
country
is
low
not
only
from
the
north
to
that
river
but
also
beyond
it
as
far
south
as
cape
verd
which
is
the
highest
land
on
all
this
coast
and
is
miles
from
cape
branco
this
kingdom
of
the
jalofs
on
the
senegal
is
bounded
on
the
east
by
the
country
called
on
the
south
by
the
kingdom
of
or
gambia
on
the
west
by
the
atlantic
ocean
and
on
the
north
by
the
river
senegal
and
the
azanhaji
the
king
who
reigned
in
senegal
in
my
time
was
named
zukholin
and
was
years
old
this
kingdom
is
not
hereditary
but
for
the
most
part
three
or
four
of
the
principal
lords
of
whom
there
are
many
in
the
country
choose
a
king
in
the
event
of
a
vacancy
but
always
fix
their
choice
on
a
person
of
noble
lineage
who
reigns
only
as
long
as
he
gives
satisfaction
to
these
great
lords
they
often
dethrone
their
kings
by
force
who
on
the
other
hand
often
render
themselves
so
powerful
as
to
stand
on
their
defence
this
renders
the
government
unsettled
and
is
productive
of
civil
wars
similar
to
egypt
where
the
soldan
of
cairo
is
always
in
fear
of
being
killed
or
banished
the
people
are
savages
and
extremely
poor
having
no
walled
towns
and
their
villages
are
entirely
composed
of
thatched
cottages
they
use
neither
lime
nor
stone
in
building
not
knowing
how
to
make
the
one
or
to
form
the
other
the
kingdom
of
the
jalofs
is
small
and
as
i
was
informed
extends
only
miles
along
the
coast
and
about
the
same
distance
inland
the
king
has
no
settled
revenue
but
the
lords
of
the
country
court
his
favour
by
making
him
yearly
presents
of
horses
which
being
scarce
are
in
high
estimation
together
with
horse
furniture
cows
and
goats
pulse
millet
and
other
things
he
likewise
increases
his
wealth
by
means
of
robbery
and
by
reducing
his
own
subjects
and
those
of
neighbouring
provinces
to
slavery
employing
a
part
of
these
slaves
to
cultivate
the
lands
which
are
assigned
to
him
and
selling
the
rest
to
the
arabs
and
azanhaji
traders
who
bring
horses
and
other
things
for
sale
as
likewise
to
the
christians
since
they
have
established
a
trade
in
these
parts
every
man
may
keep
as
many
wives
as
he
pleases
the
king
has
always
upwards
of
thirty
and
distinguishes
them
according
to
their
descent
and
the
rank
of
the
lords
whose
daughters
they
are
he
keeps
them
in
certain
villages
of
his
own
eight
or
ten
in
one
place
each
having
a
separate
house
to
dwell
in
with
a
certain
number
of
young
women
to
attend
her
and
slaves
to
cultivate
the
land
which
is
assigned
for
her
maintenance
which
they
sow
and
reap
and
to
tend
her
cows
and
goats
when
the
king
comes
to
any
of
these
villages
he
brings
no
provisions
along
with
him
as
his
women
are
obliged
to
support
him
and
his
retinue
whenever
he
visits
them
every
morning
at
sunrise
each
of
his
wives
in
the
village
where
he
happens
to
reside
prepares
three
or
four
dishes
of
various
viands
such
as
flesh
fish
or
other
dainties
cooked
in
their
fashion
which
are
carried
by
the
slaves
to
the
kings
pantry
so
that
in
less
than
an
hour
thirty
or
forty
dishes
are
provided
and
when
the
king
has
a
mind
to
eat
he
finds
every
thing
ready
at
his
command
when
he
has
eaten
of
such
things
as
he
likes
best
the
remainder
is
given
to
his
retinue
but
as
this
diet
is
never
very
plentiful
they
are
but
poorly
fed
he
travels
about
in
this
manner
from
place
to
place
visiting
his
several
wives
by
which
means
he
has
a
very
numerous
issue
and
whenever
one
of
his
wives
happens
to
fall
with
child
he
visits
her
no
more
the
lords
or
chiefs
of
the
country
live
in
a
similar
manner
these
negroes
profess
me
mahometan
religion
but
are
not
even
so
well
instructed
in
it
as
the
tawny
moors
more
especially
the
common
people
the
lords
have
always
about
them
some
arabs
or
azanhaji
for
this
purpose
who
inculcate
on
their
minds
that
it
would
be
disgraceful
for
men
of
their
quality
to
live
in
ignorance
of
the
laws
of
god
like
the
common
people
who
have
no
religion
they
have
become
mahometans
merely
by
means
of
their
intercourse
with
the
azanhaji
and
arabs
for
since
they
became
acquainted
with
the
christians
they
are
by
no
means
so
fond
of
the
mahometan
faith
the
generality
of
the
negroes
go
quite
naked
except
a
piece
of
goat
skin
before
but
the
lords
who
are
able
to
procure
such
wear
cotton
shirts
which
are
spun
and
manufactured
by
their
women
their
webs
are
only
a
span
in
width
as
they
have
not
sufficient
art
to
construct
and
use
wider
looms
so
that
they
are
obliged
to
sew
five
six
or
more
of
these
webs
together
when
it
is
required
to
make
any
large
piece
of
work
the
shirts
reach
half
way
down
the
thighs
and
have
wide
sleeves
which
cover
only
half
of
their
arms
they
wear
also
cotton
drawers
reaching
to
the
small
of
their
legs
and
these
drawers
are
made
preposterously
wide
being
often
or
forty
palms
in
circumference
so
that
when
tied
on
they
are
full
of
plaits
and
though
like
a
sack
before
the
hinder
part
trails
on
the
ground
like
the
train
of
a
large
petticoat
thus
though
making
a
most
ridiculous
appearance
they
think
nothing
comes
up
to
their
dress
for
elegance
and
they
often
ask
the
europeans
if
they
ever
saw
a
finer
dress
their
women
both
married
and
unmarried
go
naked
from
the
waist
upwards
and
wear
a
piece
of
cotton
which
covers
them
from
the
waist
to
the
middle
of
the
legs
both
sexes
go
barefooted
and
have
no
coverings
to
their
heads
and
weave
and
tie
their
hair
though
short
into
neat
tresses
the
men
often
employ
themselves
in
womens
work
such
as
spinning
washing
clothes
and
such
like
employments
this
country
is
extremely
hot
the
month
of
january
being
not
so
cold
as
it
is
with
us
in
italy
in
the
month
of
april
and
the
farther
we
went
to
the
south
the
weather
became
so
much
the
hotter
both
men
and
women
wash
themselves
four
or
five
times
and
are
very
cleanly
in
their
persons
but
are
by
no
means
so
in
regard
of
eating
in
which
they
observe
no
rule
although
very
ignorant
and
extremely
awkward
in
any
thing
to
which
they
have
not
been
accustomed
they
are
as
expert
as
any
european
can
be
in
their
own
business
and
in
all
things
with
which
they
are
acquainted
they
are
full
of
words
and
extremely
talkative
and
are
for
the
most
part
liars
and
cheats
yet
they
are
exceedingly
hospitable
and
charitably
disposed
as
they
will
most
readily
give
a
dinner
or
a
supper
or
a
nights
lodging
to
any
stranger
who
comes
to
their
houses
without
expecting
any
remuneration
or
reward
the
chiefs
of
these
negroes
are
often
at
war
against
each
other
or
against
the
neighbouring
tribes
or
nations
but
they
have
no
cavalry
for
want
of
horses
in
war
their
only
defensive
armour
is
a
large
target
made
of
the
skin
of
an
animal
called
which
is
very
difficultly
pierced
and
their
principal
weapons
are
or
light
darts
which
they
throw
with
great
dexterity
these
darts
are
pointed
with
iron
the
length
of
a
span
and
barbed
in
different
directions
so
that
they
make
dangerous
wounds
and
tear
the
flesh
extremely
when
pulled
out
they
have
also
a
moorish
weapon
like
a
turkish
sword
or
cimeter
and
made
of
iron
without
any
steel
which
they
procure
from
the
negroes
on
the
river
gambia
as
they
either
have
no
iron
in
their
own
country
or
want
knowledge
or
industry
in
working
it
having
but
few
weapons
or
rather
no
missiles
their
wars
are
very
bloody
as
they
soon
come
to
close
quarters
and
their
strokes
seldom
fall
in
vain
and
being
extremely
fierce
and
courageous
they
will
rather
allow
themselves
to
be
slain
as
save
themselves
by
flight
neither
are
they
disheartened
by
seeing
their
companions
slain
they
have
no
ships
nor
had
they
ever
seen
any
before
the
portuguese
came
upon
their
coast
but
those
who
dwell
upon
the
river
senegal
and
some
who
are
settled
on
the
sea
coast
have
or
canoes
called
by
the
portuguese
which
are
hollowed
out
of
a
single
piece
of
wood
the
largest
of
which
will
carry
three
or
four
men
they
use
these
almadias
for
catching
fish
and
for
transporting
themselves
up
or
down
the
river
the
negroes
of
this
country
are
the
most
expert
swimmers
in
the
world
as
i
can
vouch
from
frequent
experience
of
their
dexterity
cada
mosto
is
incorrect
in
the
chronology
of
this
discovery
and
even
de
barros
is
not
quite
decided
as
to
the
first
discovery
of
the
senegal
he
says
that
denis
fernandez
it
in
and
that
lancerot
it
in
the
latter
of
which
is
eight
years
before
the
visit
of
cada
clarke
the
northern
mouth
of
the
senegal
is
in
lat
the
southern
in
both
so
that
the
distance
between
them
or
the
length
of
the
island
mentioned
in
the
text
is
about
e
this
fancy
of
all
the
great
rivers
in
africa
being
branches
from
one
principal
stream
is
now
known
to
be
entirely
astl
although
the
first
kingdom
or
kingdoms
of
the
negroes
lies
on
the
senegal
senega
or
sanaghas
and
others
along
the
gambia
yet
there
were
not
properly
any
kingdoms
of
these
names
on
the
north
indeed
of
the
sanagha
lay
the
country
of
the
sanhaga
azanaghi
or
azanhaji
from
whence
the
river
seems
to
have
taken
its
name
but
was
divided
among
various
tribes
of
people
and
not
under
any
one
sovereign

however
have
since
continued
to
propagate
this
first

and
foulahs

country
between
the
senegal
and

feloops
reside
what
is
meant
by
in
the
text
does
not
appear
unless
it
may
obscurely
indicate
e
section
of
the
voyage
to
the
country
of
a
king
named
budomel
with
some
account
of
his
territory
and
the
manners
of
his
having
passed
the
river
senegal
we
sailed
about
miles
farther
south
along
the
coast
which
was
all
low
land
without
mountains
till
we
came
to
the
territory
or
kingdom
of
budomel
as
some
portuguese
who
had
dealt
with
budomel
represented
him
as
a
very
just
person
who
paid
for
any
goods
he
might
receive
and
might
therefore
be
confided
in
i
stopped
at
his
country
that
i
might
endeavour
to
dispose
of
some
spanish
horses
i
had
on
board
which
are
in
great
request
among
the
negroes
besides
which
i
had
some
cloth
moorish
wrought
silks
and
other
commodities
for
sale
we
came
therefore
to
anchor
at
a
place
on
the
coast
called
palma
di
budomel
which
is
only
an
open
roadstead
and
not
a
port
i
immediately
dispatched
my
negro
interpreter
on
shore
to
inform
this
lord
of
my
arrival
and
of
the
goods
i
had
on
board
for
sale
not
long
afterwards
budomel
came
himself
to
the
beach
attended
by
about
fifteen
horsemen
and
an
hundred
and
fifty
foot
and
sent
a
message
desiring
me
to
land
with
professions
of
a
friendly
disposition
and
promising
to
render
me
every
attention
and
service
in
his
power
i
went
accordingly
on
shore
immediately
and
was
received
with
great
civility
after
some
discourse
i
delivered
to
him
seven
horses
with
their
furniture
and
every
other
article
for
which
he
expressed
an
inclination
all
of
which
had
cost
me
ducats
trusting
to
his
honour
for
payment
which
was
to
be
in
slaves
and
which
he
promised
to
deliver
at
his
own
residence
which
was
miles
distant
from
the
shore
whither
he
invited
me
to
accompany
him
to
this
invitation
i
readily
agreed
induced
as
much
by
a
desire
of
seeing
the
country
as
on
account
of
receiving
payment
before
setting
out
however
budomel
made
me
a
present
of
a
beautiful
negress
about
twelve
years
of
age
who
he
said
was
meant
to
serve
me
in
the
cabin
and
i
received
the
gift
and
sent
her
on
board
the
caravel
i
was
furnished
by
budomel
with
horses
and
every
thing
necessary
for
the
journey
and
when
we
arrived
within
four
miles
of
his
residence
he
gave
me
in
charge
to
his
nephew
bisboror
who
was
lord
of
a
small
town
or
village
at
which
we
stopped
bisboror
took
me
to
his
own
house
where
i
was
treated
with
much
civility
and
attention
during
days
which
i
tarried
in
that
place
this
was
in
november
in
that
time
i
went
often
to
visit
budomel
accompanied
by
his
nephew
and
had
many
opportunities
to
observe
the
produce
of
the
country
and
the
manners
of
the
inhabitants
more
especially
as
on
account
of
the
tempestuous
weather
i
was
under
the
necessity
of
travelling
back
by
land
to
the
river
senegal
for
finding
it
impossible
to
get
on
board
at
the
coast
by
reason
of
the
surf
i
had
to
order
the
ship
to
return
to
that
river
and
went
there
by
land
to
on
this
occasion
being
very
desirous
to
transmit
instructions
to
those
on
board
the
ship
to
meet
me
at
the
river
senegal
i
inquired
among
the
negroes
if
any
one
would
undertake
to
carry
a
letter
from
the
shore
several
of
them
readily
offered
their
services
though
the
ship
lay
three
miles
from
the
shore
and
owing
to
a
strong
wind
the
sea
broke
on
the
shore
with
a
tremendous
surf
insomuch
that
i
thought
it
impossible
for
any
one
to
succeed
in
the
attempt
besides
the
surf
there
were
several
sand
banks
near
the
shore
and
other
banks
about
half
way
to
the
ship
between
which
there
ran
a
strong
current
sometimes
one
way
and
sometimes
the
other
along
shore
so
that
it
was
extremely
difficult
for
any
one
to
swim
through
without
infinite
danger
of
being
carried
away
by
the
stream
and
the
sea
broke
with
such
violence
on
the
banks
that
it
seemed
quite
impossible
to
surmount
such
complicated
obstacles
yet
two
of
the
negroes
offered
to
go
and
only
demanded
two
of
tin
for
each
of
them
one
mavulgi
being
worth
no
more
than
a
at
which
price
they
engaged
to
carry
my
letter
in
safety
to
the
ship
i
can
not
express
the
difficulties
which
they
encountered
in
passing
the
sand
bank
they
were
sometimes
out
of
sight
for
a
considerable
space
so
that
i
often
thought
they
were
both
drowned
at
last
one
of
them
finding
himself
unable
to
resist
the
violence
with
which
the
waves
broke
over
him
turned
back
but
the
other
being
stronger
got
over
the
bank
after
struggling
a
whole
hour
and
having
carried
the
letter
to
the
caravel
returned
with
an
answer
this
seemed
to
me
very
wonderful
and
made
me
conclude
that
the
negroes
of
this
coast
must
be
the
most
expert
swimmers
in
the
world
it
has
been
already
observed
that
those
who
are
called
lords
in
this
country
have
neither
castles
nor
cities
the
king
even
having
nothing
but
villages
with
thatched
houses
budomel
is
lord
of
one
part
of
this
kingdom
yet
his
place
of
residence
was
not
a
palace
nor
even
a
walled
house
these
great
men
are
not
lords
on
account
of
their
riches
or
treasure
as
they
possess
neither
nor
have
they
any
coin
in
use
among
them
but
they
are
considered
as
such
out
of
courtesy
and
on
account
of
the
great
retinues
by
which
they
are
always
attended
being
more
feared
and
respected
by
their
subjects
than
any
of
the
lords
in
italy
budomel
has
several
villages
appointed
for
his
own
habitation
and
that
of
his
wives
as
he
never
fixes
in
one
place
the
village
in
which
i
resided
with
bisboror
was
one
of
his
habitations
containing
between
forty
and
fifty
thatched
cottages
built
near
one
another
and
surrounded
with
ditches
and
strong
pallisades
having
only
one
or
two
passages
left
for
entering
and
every
house
had
a
inclosed
by
a
hedge
according
to
report
budomel
had
nine
wives
in
this
place
and
more
or
less
in
several
other
villages
each
of
these
wives
had
five
or
six
young
negresses
to
attend
upon
her
with
all
of
whom
he
might
sleep
when
he
pleased
without
giving
offence
to
the
wives
for
such
is
the
custom
of
the
country
both
sexes
are
extremely
amorous
and
budomel
strongly
importuned
me
for
philacteries
in
which
he
had
been
informed
the
europeans
were
very
expert
and
offered
any
reward
within
his
power
for
my
compliance
they
are
very
jealous
and
suffer
no
man
to
enter
the
houses
which
are
inhabited
by
the
women
not
even
their
own
sons
budomel
is
always
attended
by
a
retinue
of
at
least
negroes
who
are
changed
from
time
to
time
some
going
away
and
others
coming
back
in
their
room
besides
which
many
people
repair
to
wait
upon
him
from
the
adjacent
places
which
are
under
his
government
before
arriving
at
his
particular
apartment
there
are
seven
large
courts
one
within
the
other
having
a
tree
in
the
middle
of
each
where
those
wait
who
come
to
him
on
business
his
family
is
distributed
in
these
courts
according
to
their
several
ranks
the
most
considerable
having
their
station
in
the
court
nearest
his
dwelling
and
the
meanest
in
the
outermost
court
of
all
few
people
are
allowed
to
approach
his
own
particular
apartment
except
the
christians
and
azanhaji
who
have
free
admission
and
more
liberty
is
allowed
to
them
than
to
the
negroes
this
lord
affects
great
state
and
gravity
in
his
deportment
and
does
not
allow
himself
to
be
seen
except
an
hour
every
morning
and
for
a
short
while
in
the
evening
at
which
times
he
appears
near
the
door
of
an
apartment
in
the
first
court
into
which
only
persons
of
note
are
permitted
to
enter
on
these
occasions
of
giving
audience
every
person
who
come
to
speak
to
him
however
high
may
be
his
rank
is
in
the
first
place
obliged
to
strip
himself
stark
naked
except
the
small
cloth
in
front
formerly
mentioned
and
immediately
on
entering
the
court
he
falls
down
on
his
knees
bows
down
his
head
to
the
ground
and
scatters
dust
with
both
hands
on
his
own
head
and
shoulders
neither
is
even
the
nearest
relations
of
the
lords
exempted
from
this
humiliating
expression
of
their
duty
and
obedience
the
person
who
receives
an
audience
continues
in
this
humble
posture
a
great
while
strewing
himself
with
sand
and
crawling
on
his
knees
till
he
approaches
the
great
man
and
when
within
two
paces
of
his
lord
he
stops
and
begins
to
relate
his
case
still
continuing
on
his
knees
with
his
head
down
and
throwing
sand
an
his
head
in
token
of
great
humility
all
the
time
the
lord
scarcely
appears
to
notice
him
and
continues
to
discourse
with
other
persons
and
when
the
vassal
has
related
his
story
the
lord
gives
him
an
answer
in
two
words
with
an
arrogant
aspect
such
is
their
affected
pride
and
grandeur
and
such
the
submission
which
is
shewn
him
which
in
my
opinion
proceeds
from
fear
as
their
lords
for
every
little
fault
they
commit
take
away
their
wives
and
children
and
cause
them
to
be
sold
as
slaves
budomel
treated
me
with
the
utmost
attention
and
civility
and
used
to
carry
me
in
the
evenings
into
a
sort
of
mosque
where
the
arab
and
azanhaji
priests
whom
he
had
always
about
his
person
used
to
say
prayers
his
manner
on
these
occasions
was
as
follows
being
entered
into
the
mosque
which
was
in
one
of
the
courts
belonging
to
his
residence
and
where
he
was
attended
by
some
of
the
principal
negroes
he
first
stood
some
little
time
with
his
eyes
lifted
up
as
if
it
were
to
heaven
then
advancing
two
steps
he
spoke
a
few
words
in
a
low
tone
after
which
he
stretched
himself
on
the
ground
which
he
kissed
the
azanhaji
and
the
rest
of
his
attendants
doing
the
same
then
rising
up
he
repeated
the
same
series
of
actions
repeatedly
for
ten
or
twelve
times
which
occupied
about
half
an
hour
when
all
was
over
he
asked
my
opinion
of
their
manner
of
worship
and
desired
one
to
give
an
account
of
the
nature
of
our
religion
on
this
i
told
him
in
the
presence
of
all
his
doctors
that
the
religion
of
mahomet
was
false
and
the
romish
the
only
true
faith
this
made
the
arabs
and
azanhaji
extremely
angry
but
budomel
laughed
on
the
occasion
and
said
that
he
considered
the
religion
of
the
christians
to
be
good
as
god
alone
could
have
gifted
them
with
so
much
riches
and
understanding
he
added
however
that
in
his
opinion
the
mahometan
law
must
be
good
also
and
he
believed
that
the
negroes
were
more
sure
of
salvation
than
the
christians
because
god
was
just
who
had
given
a
paradise
to
the
christians
in
this
world
and
would
certainly
give
one
to
the
negroes
in
the
next
as
they
possessed
scarcely
any
good
in
this
world
in
comparison
in
all
his
discourse
he
shewed
a
good
understanding
and
took
great
pleasure
in
hearing
the
customs
of
the
christians
described
i
firmly
believe
he
might
easily
have
been
converted
to
christianity
had
it
not
been
from
fear
of
losing
his
power
as
i
was
often
told
by
his
nephew
with
whom
i
lodged
and
he
took
great
delight
in
hearing
me
discourse
of
our
religion
the
table
of
budomel
like
all
other
lords
and
people
of
condition
in
this
country
is
supplied
by
his
wives
in
the
same
manner
as
has
been
already
mentioned
in
regard
to
zukholin
the
king
of
senegal
each
wife
sending
him
a
certain
number
of
dishes
every
day
he
and
the
other
lords
eat
on
the
ground
without
any
regularity
or
company
except
the
arabs
and
azanhaji
who
are
their
teachers
and
priests
and
one
or
two
of
their
principal
negro
attendants
the
inferior
people
eat
in
messes
of
ten
or
twelve
each
having
a
basket
full
of
victuals
set
in
the
midst
into
which
all
put
their
hands
at
the
same
time
they
eat
but
little
at
one
meal
but
repeat
these
four
or
five
times
a
day
the
text
seems
corrupted
in
giving
so
large
a
distance
between
the
senegal
river
and
this
country
of
king
budomel
as
miles
to
the
south
or
rather
would
carry
us
to
what
is
called
the
or
windward
coast
of
guinea
in
lat
and
from
the
sequel
cada
mosto
does
not
appear
to
have
passed
cape
verd
till
after
quitting
the
country
of
budomel
according
to
brue
as
quoted
by
clarke
the
king
of
kayor
or
kayhor
was
styled
damel
kayor
or
cayor
appears
on
our
maps
above
an
hundred
miles
up
the
senegal
and
on
its
north
side
which
therefore
can
have
no
reference
to
the
place
in
the
text
i
am
disposed
to
believe
that
the
distance
in
the
text
ought
only
to
have
been
miles
and
that
the
territory
of
budomel
was
in
the
country
of
the
jalofs
between
the
senegal
and
cape
verd
at
the
mouth
of
a
small
river
on
which
our
charts
place
two
towns
masaye
and
enibaul
in
lat
the
grosso
or
venetian
groat
is
worth
about
three
astl
section
vi
of
the
country
of
budomel
on
account
of
the
great
heats
in
the
kingdom
of
senegal
and
all
the
other
countries
of
the
negroes
on
the
coast
no
wheat
rye
barley
or
spelt
can
grow
neither
are
vines
cultivated
as
we
knew
experimentally
from
a
trial
made
with
seeds
from
our
ship
for
wheat
and
these
other
articles
of
culture
require
a
temperate
climate
and
frequent
showers
both
of
which
are
wanting
here
where
they
have
no
rains
during
nine
months
of
the
year
from
october
to
june
both
included
but
they
have
large
and
small
millet
beans
and
the
largest
and
finest
kidney
beans
in
the
world
as
large
as
hazle
nuts
longer
than
those
of
the
venetian
territory
and
beautifully
speckled
with
various
colours
as
if
painted
their
beans
are
large
flat
and
of
a
lively
red
colour
and
they
have
likewise
white
beans
they
sow
in
july
at
the
beginning
of
the
rains
and
reap
in
september
when
they
cease
thus
they
prepare
the
soil
sow
the
seed
and
get
in
the
harvest
all
in
three
months
but
they
are
bad
husbandmen
and
so
exceedingly
averse
to
labour
that
they
sow
no
more
than
is
barely
sufficient
to
last
them
throughout
the
year
and
never
lay
up
any
store
for
sale
in
cultivating
the
ground
four
or
five
of
them
go
into
a
field
with
spades
with
which
they
turn
up
the
soil
about
four
inches
deep
yet
such
is
the
fertility
of
the
soil
that
it
makes
ample
returns
for
this
slight
culture
without
any
farther
trouble
the
liquors
of
the
negroes
are
water
milk
and
palm
wine
which
they
call
mighol
or
migwol
which
is
taken
from
a
tree
of
the
palm
tribe
very
numerous
in
this
country
somewhat
like
the
date
tree
but
not
the
same
and
which
furnishes
this
liquor
the
whole
year
round
the
trees
are
tapped
in
two
or
three
places
near
the
root
and
from
these
wounds
a
brown
juice
runs
out
as
thin
as
skimmed
milk
into
calabasses
that
are
placed
to
receive
the
liquor
which
drops
but
slowly
as
one
tree
will
only
fill
two
calabasses
from
morning
till
night
this
migwol
or
wine
is
an
exceedingly
pleasant
drink
which
intoxicates
like
wine
unless
mixed
with
water
immediately
after
it
is
drawn
from
the
tree
it
is
as
sweet
as
any
wine
whatever
but
the
luscious
taste
goes
off
more
and
more
as
it
is
kept
and
at
length
it
becomes
sour
it
drinks
better
than
at
first
after
three
or
four
days
as
it
depurates
by
keeping
and
is
not
so
sweet
i
have
often
drank
of
it
indeed
every
day
that
i
remained
in
the
country
and
liked
it
better
than
the
wines
of
italy
this
liquor
is
not
so
abundant
as
that
every
one
may
have
it
at
discretion
yet
all
may
have
some
especially
the
chiefs
as
the
trees
are
not
planted
in
gardens
like
vines
and
fruit
trees
in
europe
but
are
found
wild
in
the
forests
and
are
consequently
accessible
to
all
in
this
country
there
are
several
sorts
of
fruit
which
resemble
those
of
europe
though
not
exactly
the
same
and
which
are
very
good
though
they
grow
wild
and
were
they
to
be
cultivated
as
ours
are
would
prove
much
better
than
such
as
are
produced
in
the
northern
climates
the
quality
of
the
soil
and
air
in
this
part
of
africa
being
more
nutritive
the
whole
country
is
plain
and
fertile
abounding
in
good
pasture
and
is
covered
by
an
infinite
number
of
large
and
beautiful
trees
that
are
not
known
in
europe
it
contains
several
lakes
of
fresh
water
none
of
them
large
but
very
deep
and
full
of
excellent
fish
which
differ
much
from
those
that
are
caught
in
italy
and
many
water
serpents
which
the
natives
call
they
use
a
kind
of
oil
with
their
victuals
which
tastes
like
oil
of
olives
has
a
pleasant
flavour
of
violets
and
tinges
the
food
even
better
than
saffron
but
i
could
not
learn
what
it
was
produced
from
there
is
likewise
a
plant
which
produces
large
quantities
of
small
in
this
country
there
are
many
kinds
of
animals
but
serpents
are
particularly
numerous
both
large
and
small
some
of
which
are
venomous
the
large
ones
are
more
than
two
paces
long
but
have
neither
legs
nor
wings
as
has
been
reported
by
some
persons
but
some
of
them
are
so
very
thick
as
to
have
swallowed
a
goat
at
one
morsel
these
serpents
retire
in
troops
as
the
natives
report
to
certain
parts
of
the
country
where
white
ants
are
found
in
prodigious
swarms
and
which
by
a
kind
of
instinct
are
said
to
build
houses
for
these
serpents
of
earth
which
they
carry
in
their
months
for
that
purpose
resembling
ovens
and
often
to
the
number
of
in
one
place
the
negroes
are
great
enchanters
and
use
charms
upon
almost
all
occasions
particularly
in
regard
to
serpents
over
which
they
have
great
power
a
genoese
worthy
of
credit
who
was
in
this
country
the
year
before
my
arrival
and
who
likewise
lodged
with
bisboror
the
nephew
of
budomel
told
me
he
once
heard
a
load
noise
of
whistling
about
the
house
in
the
middle
of
the
night
being
awakened
by
the
noise
he
saw
bisboror
get
out
of
bed
and
order
two
negroes
to
bring
his
camel
being
asked
where
he
meant
to
go
at
that
time
of
night
he
said
he
had
business
which
must
be
executed
but
would
soon
return
on
coming
back
after
some
time
and
the
genoese
expressing
curiosity
to
learn
the
object
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
bisboror
asked
if
he
had
heard
the
hissing
noise
about
the
house
during
the
night
and
said
that
it
had
been
made
by
the
serpents
which
would
have
killed
a
great
many
of
his
cattle
if
he
had
not
sent
them
back
to
their
quarters
by
the
employment
of
certain
enchantments
the
genoese
was
astonished
at
this
story
but
bisboror
said
he
had
no
need
to
wonder
at
this
small
matter
as
budomed
could
do
a
great
deal
more
extraordinary
things
with
the
serpents
than
he
could
in
particular
when
he
had
a
mind
to
envenom
his
weapons
he
used
to
draw
a
large
circle
into
which
by
means
of
his
enchantments
he
brought
all
the
serpents
of
the
neighbourhood
from
which
he
selected
those
he
thought
most
poisonous
and
allowed
all
the
others
to
go
away
with
the
blood
of
these
serpents
mixed
up
with
the
seeds
of
a
certain
tree
he
infected
his
weapons
with
so
deadly
a
poison
that
if
they
drew
but
the
least
drop
of
blood
the
person
or
animal
wounded
by
them
was
sure
to
die
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
bisboror
farther
offered
to
shew
him
an
example
of
the
efficacy
of
this
art
but
the
genoese
declined
witnessing
the
experiment
this
story
of
the
serpents
is
the
more
probable
that
i
have
heard
of
persons
in
italy
who
could
charm
them
in
a
similar
manner
but
i
am
apt
to
believe
that
the
negroes
are
the
most
expert
sorcerers
in
the
world
the
only
tame
animals
in
the
kingdom
of
senegal
are
oxen
cows
and
goats
having
no
sheep
which
love
a
temperate
or
cold
air
and
could
not
live
in
this
hot
climate
nature
however
has
provided
mankind
with
necessaries
fitted
for
their
various
occasions
having
furnished
the
europeans
with
wool
as
they
have
need
of
warm
clothing
while
the
negroes
who
live
in
such
intense
heat
have
been
supplied
with
cotton
by
the
almighty
owing
to
the
heat
in
my
opinion
the
cattle
of
this
country
are
much
smaller
than
those
of
italy
it
is
a
great
rarity
to
see
a
red
cow
in
this
country
as
they
are
all
black
or
white
or
mottled
with
black
and
white
spots
beasts
of
prey
such
as
lions
leopards
and
wolves
are
numerous
and
there
are
plenty
of
hares
wild
elephants
go
about
in
troops
like
the
wild
swine
in
italy
but
can
never
be
tamed
as
they
are
in
other
parts
of
the
world
as
the
elephant
is
a
animal
i
shall
only
observe
in
general
that
those
of
africa
are
of
a
very
large
size
as
may
be
easily
conceived
by
the
size
of
their
teeth
which
are
imported
into
europe
of
these
large
teeth
or
tusks
rather
each
elephant
has
two
in
the
lower
jaw
the
points
of
which
turn
down
whereas
those
of
the
wild
boar
are
turned
up
before
my
voyage
to
africa
i
had
been
told
that
the
elephant
could
not
bend
its
knee
and
slept
standing
but
this
is
an
egregious
falsehood
for
the
bending
of
their
knees
can
be
plainly
perceived
when
they
walk
and
they
certainly
lie
down
and
rise
again
like
other
animals
they
never
shed
their
large
teeth
before
death
neither
do
they
do
any
harm
to
man
unless
provoked
in
that
case
the
elephant
makes
his
attack
with
his
trunk
which
is
a
kind
of
nose
protruded
to
a
great
length
he
can
contract
and
extend
this
proboscis
at
pleasure
and
is
able
to
toss
a
man
with
it
as
far
as
a
sling
can
throw
a
stone
it
is
in
vain
to
think
of
escape
by
running
let
the
person
be
ever
so
swift
in
case
the
elephant
pursues
in
earnest
as
his
strides
are
of
prodigious
length
they
are
more
dangerous
when
they
have
young
ones
in
their
company
than
at
any
other
time
of
which
the
females
have
only
three
or
four
at
a
birth
they
feed
on
the
leaves
and
fruit
of
trees
pulling
down
the
large
boughs
with
their
trunks
and
bringing
them
to
their
mouths
this
trunk
is
composed
of
a
very
thick
cartilage
and
is
pliable
in
every
direction
there
are
many
kinds
of
birds
in
this
country
and
parrots
are
particularly
numerous
which
are
much
hated
by
the
negroes
because
they
do
much
damage
to
their
crops
of
pulse
and
millet
there
are
said
to
be
several
kinds
of
parrots
but
i
never
saw
more
than
two
one
of
these
is
like
the
kind
which
is
brought
into
italy
from
alexandria
in
egypt
but
rather
smaller
the
other
kind
is
much
larger
having
a
brown
head
neck
bill
and
legs
with
a
yellow
and
green
body
i
procured
a
considerable
number
of
both
sorts
particularly
of
the
smaller
kind
many
of
which
died
but
i
brought
back
to
portugal
where
i
sold
them
for
half
a
ducat
each
these
birds
are
very
industrious
in
constructing
their
nests
which
they
build
with
bulrushes
and
the
small
leaves
of
the
palm
and
other
trees
in
a
very
curious
and
ingenious
manner
choosing
the
slenderest
branch
of
a
tree
the
parrot
fastens
a
bulrush
of
about
two
spans
long
to
its
outer
extremity
at
the
depending
end
of
which
rush
it
weaves
its
nest
in
a
most
beautiful
manner
suspended
like
a
ball
and
having
only
one
passage
for
entering
by
this
means
they
contrive
to
preserve
their
young
from
being
devoured
by
the
serpents
as
the
small
twigs
from
which
the
nests
are
suspended
are
unable
to
bear
the
weight
of
the
serpents
there
are
likewise
abundance
of
those
birds
called
hens
in
europe
which
come
to
us
out
of
the
levant
they
have
likewise
other
birds
both
large
and
small
which
are
quite
different
from
any
that
are
known
in
italy
as
i
was
long
on
shore
i
went
several
times
to
see
their
markets
or
fairs
which
were
held
every
monday
and
friday
in
a
meadow
not
far
from
where
i
resided
the
men
and
women
from
four
or
five
miles
around
came
to
this
place
with
their
various
commodities
and
those
who
lived
at
a
greater
distance
went
to
other
markets
nearer
their
habitations
the
great
poverty
of
the
natives
appeared
manifest
in
the
goods
they
brought
to
these
fairs
consisting
of
small
quantities
of
cotton
cloth
and
cotton
yarn
pulse
oil
millet
wooden
tubs
palm
matts
and
every
thing
else
useful
to
life
according
to
their
manners
likewise
arms
and
some
small
quantities
of
gold
having
no
money
or
coin
of
any
kind
all
their
trade
was
carried
on
by
way
of
barter
or
exchange
of
one
thing
for
another
sometimes
two
or
three
things
for
one
according
to
their
different
values
all
these
blacks
used
to
gaze
on
me
as
if
i
had
been
a
prodigy
having
never
seen
a
white
man
before
some
took
hold
of
my
hands
which
they
rubbed
with
spittle
to
see
if
the
whiteness
was
natural
or
artificial
and
expressed
their
wonder
to
find
that
my
skin
was
not
painted
they
were
as
much
astonished
at
my
dress
being
clothed
in
the
spanish
fashion
with
a
black
damask
waistcoat
and
a
cloak
over
it
they
seemed
much
surprised
at
the
waistcoat
and
greatly
admired
the
woollen
cloth
which
they
had
never
seen
any
of
before
my
chief
purpose
in
going
to
these
fairs
was
to
see
what
quantity
of
gold
was
brought
thither
horses
are
very
scarce
and
of
great
value
in
the
country
of
the
negroes
being
brought
all
the
way
from
that
part
of
barbary
which
lies
nearest
to
europe
by
the
arabs
and
azanhaji
owing
to
the
great
heat
horses
do
not
live
long
here
for
they
grow
so
fat
that
they
can
not
stale
and
so
burst
they
are
fed
with
bean
leaves
which
are
gathered
after
the
beans
are
brought
from
the
fields
and
being
dried
like
hay
are
cut
small
and
given
to
the
horses
instead
of
oats
they
give
millet
also
which
contributes
greatly
to
make
them
fat
a
horse
and
his
furniture
sells
for
from
nine
to
fourteen
negroes
according
to
his
goodness
and
beauty
and
when
a
negro
lord
buys
a
horse
he
sends
for
his
horse
sorcerers
who
cause
a
fire
to
be
kindled
of
the
stalks
of
certain
herbs
and
hold
the
horses
head
by
the
bridle
over
the
smoke
while
they
repeat
over
some
few
words
by
way
of
incantation
they
afterwards
have
him
anointed
all
over
with
fine
oil
and
having
kept
him
eighteen
or
twenty
days
without
allowing
any
one
to
see
him
they
affix
some
moorish
charms
to
his
neck
which
have
the
appearance
of
small
square
billets
of
writing
folded
up
and
covered
with
red
leather
and
affirm
that
they
will
go
into
battle
with
greater
safety
by
means
of
these
scrolls
or
annulets
the
women
of
this
country
are
very
pleasant
and
merry
especially
the
young
ones
and
delight
in
singing
and
dancing
taking
this
diversion
only
at
night
by
moonlight
and
their
manner
of
dancing
is
very
different
from
that
of
the
italians
many
things
in
our
ships
seemed
wonderful
to
the
negroes
particularly
our
but
much
more
our
artillery
when
some
of
them
were
on
board
my
ship
i
caused
one
of
the
guns
to
be
fired
off
which
threw
them
into
a
dreadful
panic
and
their
terror
was
much
increased
on
being
told
that
one
could
kill
an
hundred
men
on
which
account
they
alleged
that
it
must
be
something
belonging
to
the
devil
they
were
likewise
greatly
astonished
at
a
which
one
of
our
sailors
played
upon
to
divert
them
and
on
examining
the
several
parts
and
ornaments
of
the
instrument
they
conceived
that
it
was
a
living
animal
which
sung
in
different
voices
observing
their
simplicity
i
told
them
it
was
a
musical
instrument
and
put
it
into
their
hand
unblown
to
examine
they
then
perceived
that
it
was
a
work
of
art
but
believed
that
it
was
something
supernatural
and
could
only
have
been
devised
by
a
superior
being
it
sounded
so
sweetly
and
in
so
many
different
tones
having
never
heard
any
thing
which
could
be
compared
to
it
in
their
estimation
the
ship
also
and
its
various
contrivances
as
its
anchors
masts
sails
and
shrouds
afforded
them
great
subjects
for
admiration
and
wonder
they
looked
upon
the
in
the
stern
as
real
eyes
by
which
the
vessel
was
able
to
find
her
way
in
the
sea
and
observed
that
travellers
on
land
found
difficulty
to
find
the
road
from
one
place
to
another
while
we
were
able
to
travel
along
the
trackless
ocean
and
that
the
whites
must
therefore
be
the
greatest
of
sorcerers
not
inferior
to
the
devil
himself
they
shewed
great
admiration
on
seeing
a
lighted
candle
in
a
candlestick
having
themselves
no
other
artificial
light
but
that
proceeding
from
a
fire
they
have
but
when
they
find
these
they
suck
out
the
honey
and
throw
away
the
empty
comb
as
useless
at
one
time
i
bought
some
from
a
negro
and
shewed
him
how
to
extract
the
honey
after
which
on
asking
him
if
he
knew
what
remained
he
said
it
was
good
for
nothing
but
he
was
greatly
astonished
on
seeing
it
made
into
candles
and
lighted
in
his
presence
saying
that
the
europeans
knew
every
thing
their
only
musical
instruments
are
two
one
of
which
they
have
from
the
moors
which
is
like
a
large
drum
the
other
is
somewhat
like
a
fiddle
having
only
two
strings
which
they
play
on
with
their
fingers
but
gives
no
sounds
that
can
be
called
harmonious
this
is
almost
certainly
palm
oil
the
origin
of
which
will
appear
in
another
division
of
this
e
the
text
must
be
here
erroneous
as
two
paces
or
ten
feet
will
scarcely
suffice
in
describing
the
boa
constrictor
sometimes
near
thirty
feet
e
an
account
of
the
termites
or
white
ants
of
africa
will
appear
hereafter
the
circumstance
of
serpents
taking
up
their
abode
in
the
large
anthills
must
be
entirely
e
probably
the
pintado
or
guinea
e
this
in
ramusio
is
called

section
vii
of
the
voyage
from
senegal
by
cape
verd
the
river
barbasini
and
to
the
river
gambia
and
returns
to
having
seen
a
considerable
part
of
the
dominions
of
budomel
and
received
the
slaves
which
were
bargained
for
in
exchange
for
my
horses
and
other
merchandize
i
resolved
to
proceed
on
my
voyage
round
cape
verd
and
to
prosecute
discoveries
along
this
dangerous
coast
and
in
particular
to
go
in
search
of
the
kingdom
of
gambia
or
gambia
which
don
henry
had
pointed
out
on
the
information
of
a
person
who
was
well
acquainted
with
the
country
of
the
negroes
as
not
far
from
senegal
and
from
whence
it
was
reported
that
considerable
quantities
of
gold
might
be
procured
longing
to
go
in
quest
of
this
gold
i
took
my
leave
of
budomel
and
repaired
to
the
river
senegal
where
i
went
on
board
the
caravel
and
got
under
weigh
as
soon
as
possible
soon
after
leaving
the
river
senegal
as
we
were
standing
onward
with
a
press
of
sail
towards
cape
verd
we
descried
one
morning
two
ships
in
the
offing
on
joining
company
we
found
that
one
of
these
belonged
to
antonio
an
experienced
genoese
navigator
and
the
other
to
some
gentlemen
in
the
service
of
don
henry
and
that
they
had
sailed
in
company
with
the
intention
of
passing
cape
verd
to
explore
the
coast
beyond
it
in
search
of
new
discoveries
our
intentions
being
similar
i
offered
to
join
company
and
we
accordingly
proceeded
together
along
the
coast
to
the
southward
in
sight
of
land
we
came
in
sight
of
that
cape
next
day
being
about
thirty
italian
miles
from
our
last
anchorage
cape
verd
was
so
named
by
the
portuguese
who
discovered
it
about
a
year
before
because
it
is
covered
with
trees
which
continue
green
all
the
year
this
is
a
high
and
beautiful
cape
which
runs
a
considerable
way
into
the
sea
and
has
two
hills
or
small
mountains
at
its
outer
extremity
there
are
several
villages
of
the
senegal
negroes
or
jalofs
upon
and
about
this
promontory
which
are
composed
of
thatched
cabins
close
by
the
shore
and
in
sight
of
those
who
sail
past
there
are
also
some
sand
banks
which
extend
about
half
a
mile
into
the
sea
having
doubled
the
cape
we
came
to
three
small
uninhabited
islands
full
of
green
trees
and
being
in
want
of
water
we
anchored
at
that
which
seemed
the
largest
and
most
fruitful
in
hopes
of
meeting
with
a
spring
but
could
find
none
to
answer
our
purpose
we
met
however
with
the
nests
and
eggs
of
several
kinds
of
birds
such
as
we
had
never
seen
before
this
was
in
the
month
of
july
and
we
continued
here
all
day
fishing
with
lines
and
large
hooks
catching
a
prodigious
number
of
fish
among
which
were
and
gilded
fish
some
of
which
weighed
from
twelve
to
fifteen
pounds
each
on
the
next
day
we
proceeded
in
our
course
keeping
always
in
sight
of
land
and
found
a
kind
of
gulf
formed
by
the
coast
on
the
south
side
of
the
cape
this
coast
is
all
low
and
full
of
fine
large
trees
which
are
continually
green
as
the
new
leaves
grow
before
the
old
ones
fall
off
and
they
never
wither
like
those
in
europe
and
the
trees
grow
so
near
the
shore
that
they
seem
to
drink
as
it
were
the
water
of
the
sea
the
coast
is
most
beautiful
insomuch
that
i
never
saw
any
thing
comparable
to
it
though
i
had
sailed
much
both
in
the
levant
and
the
western
parts
of
europe
it
is
well
watered
every
where
by
small
rivers
but
these
are
useless
for
trade
as
they
do
not
admit
ships
of
any
size
beyond
this
little
gulf
the
coast
is
inhabited
by
two
negro
nations
called
barbasini
and
serreri
which
are
not
subject
to
the
king
of
senegal
neither
have
they
any
king
or
lord
of
their
own
but
one
person
is
more
honoured
than
another
according
to
his
condition
or
quality
they
are
great
idolaters
without
laws
and
living
in
almost
a
state
of
nature
and
extremely
cruel
and
refuse
to
become
subjected
to
any
lord
that
their
wives
and
children
may
not
be
taken
from
them
and
sold
as
slaves
as
is
the
custom
among
all
the
negro
nations
which
are
under
subjection
to
kings
or
lords
they
use
bows
and
poisoned
arrows
the
wounds
from
which
are
incurable
if
even
the
smallest
blood
is
drawn
and
the
wounded
person
or
animal
soon
dies
their
colour
is
jet
black
and
their
persons
are
well
made
the
country
is
full
of
woods
lakes
and
streams
from
which
they
derive
great
security
as
they
can
only
be
invaded
through
narrow
defiles
by
which
means
they
set
the
neighbouring
lords
at
defiance
in
former
times
the
kings
of
senegal
often
attempted
to
reduce
these
two
nations
under
obedience
but
were
always
worsted
owing
to
the
natural
strength
of
the
country
and
their
arrows
running
along
the
coast
to
the
south
with
a
fair
wind
we
discovered
the
mouth
of
a
river
about
a
wide
but
not
deep
to
which
we
gave
the
name
of
the
river
and
have
marked
it
on
the
chart
which
i
made
of
the
coast
as
sixty
miles
from
cape
verd
in
sailing
along
the
coast
we
only
made
sail
at
sun
rise
having
a
man
continually
on
the
top
and
two
others
on
the
prow
or
head
to
look
out
for
breakers
and
always
came
to
anchor
at
sun
set
about
four
or
five
miles
from
the
land
in
ten
or
twelve
fathoms
water
proceeding
on
our
voyage
in
this
cautious
manner
we
came
to
the
mouth
of
a
river
which
appeared
to
be
as
large
as
the
senegal
and
struck
by
the
fineness
of
its
appearance
and
its
rich
woods
which
came
down
to
the
very
shores
we
cast
anchor
and
determined
to
send
one
of
our
negro
interpreters
on
shore
to
endeavour
to
establish
a
friendly
intercourse
with
the
natives
every
ship
which
sails
from
portugal
for
the
coast
of
africa
is
supplied
with
some
of
these
negro
interpreters
who
consist
of
slaves
that
had
been
sold
by
the
lords
of
senegal
to
the
first
portuguese
who
touched
on
the
coast
and
who
have
learnt
the
portuguese
language
and
become
christians
these
are
hired
from
their
masters
in
portugal
who
receive
for
their
hire
a
prime
slave
from
the
cargo
on
returning
from
the
voyage
and
when
any
of
these
interpreters
have
thus
earned
four
slaves
for
their
master
they
become
free
having
cast
lots
to
determine
which
of
the
three
ships
should
send
an
interpreter
on
shore
it
fell
on
the
ship
commanded
by
the
genoese
gentleman
on
which
he
sent
an
armed
boat
ordering
the
men
not
to
touch
the
shore
but
to
push
off
as
soon
as
they
had
landed
the
interpreter
who
was
charged
to
inform
himself
respecting
the
condition
and
government
of
the
country
and
to
inquire
whether
it
produced
gold
or
any
other
commodity
worth
coming
for
no
sooner
was
the
interpreter
landed
and
the
boat
shoved
off
to
some
distance
as
ordered
than
several
natives
came
out
of
the
wood
who
had
been
in
ambush
with
bows
arrows
and
other
weapons
from
the
time
they
saw
our
ships
approach
the
coast
as
if
they
had
been
in
hopes
that
some
of
our
people
might
land
upon
the
coast
after
a
short
parley
with
our
interpreter
they
furiously
assaulted
him
with
their
or
short
moorish
swords
and
slew
him
our
people
in
the
boat
being
unable
to
give
him
any
assistance
this
intelligence
was
brought
to
the
ships
where
it
excited
much
surprise
and
concluding
that
these
people
must
be
extremely
barbarous
who
could
treat
one
of
their
own
race
with
so
much
barbarity
and
would
consequently
use
us
cruelly
if
in
their
power
we
immediately
weighed
anchor
and
stood
on
our
voyage
farther
to
the
south
which
improved
in
the
beauty
and
verdure
of
the
trees
as
we
advanced
always
sailing
within
sight
of
the
coast
which
is
everywhere
low
land
covered
with
trees
we
came
at
length
to
the
mouth
of
a
very
large
river
which
is
not
less
than
six
or
eight
miles
wide
at
the
entrance
and
narrows
a
little
way
within
to
three
or
four
miles
and
finding
that
it
could
be
safely
entered
we
determined
to
cast
anchor
for
the
night
and
to
endeavour
to
learn
next
day
if
this
were
the
river
and
kingdom
of
gambra
or
gambia
of
which
we
were
in
search
we
judged
however
from
its
noble
river
that
we
had
now
attained
the
so
anxiously
desired
country
of
gambia
and
flattered
ourselves
in
the
hope
of
finding
a
country
of
vast
riches
where
we
might
make
our
fortunes
at
once
by
returning
laden
with
gold
and
other
rich
commodities
next
day
having
but
little
wind
we
sent
on
the
small
caravel
before
well
manned
with
directions
as
their
ship
was
small
and
drew
little
water
that
they
were
to
proceed
as
far
as
possible
up
the
river
observing
whether
there
were
any
bar
or
sand
banks
at
its
mouth
and
to
take
the
soundings
with
great
care
and
if
the
river
were
found
navigable
they
were
to
return
and
make
signals
to
that
effect
finding
four
fathoms
water
at
the
entrance
the
caravel
brought
to
and
made
the
concerted
signal
on
which
it
was
thought
proper
as
that
caravel
was
small
to
send
another
boat
well
armed
along
with
her
up
the
river
and
they
were
strictly
enjoined
in
case
the
natives
were
hostile
to
enter
into
no
conflict
with
them
but
to
return
immediately
to
the
other
ships
as
the
object
of
our
voyage
was
to
cultivate
friendship
and
trade
with
the
country
which
could
only
be
accomplished
by
policy
not
by
force
the
boats
accordingly
proceeded
up
the
river
for
two
miles
leaving
the
small
caravel
at
anchor
and
found
the
banks
everywhere
beautiful
with
sixteen
fathoms
water
but
as
the
river
above
this
made
several
returns
or
reaches
they
did
not
think
it
prudent
to
venture
any
higher
when
on
their
way
back
they
saw
three
or
canoes
near
the
mouth
of
a
small
river
which
runs
into
the
large
one
these
almadias
resemble
the
skiffs
used
in
italy
which
are
called
and
are
hollowed
out
of
one
large
piece
of
wood
although
our
boats
were
strongly
armed
yet
in
obedience
to
their
orders
and
for
fear
of
being
attacked
with
poisoned
arrows
which
the
negroes
of
senegal
had
told
us
were
used
by
all
the
natives
of
gambia
they
took
to
their
oars
and
made
all
possible
haste
back
to
the
ship
by
the
time
they
got
on
board
the
almadias
which
followed
them
close
were
within
arrow
flight
there
were
about
or
thirty
negroes
in
these
three
almadias
who
stopped
for
some
time
gazing
at
the
caravel
which
was
quite
a
new
sight
to
them
but
would
neither
speak
nor
come
nearer
notwithstanding
every
endeavour
by
signs
to
induce
them
to
approach
and
at
length
they
returned
to
the
shore
about
three
next
morning
the
other
three
caravels
that
had
remained
at
anchor
without
the
river
sailed
with
the
rising
tide
and
a
light
breeze
into
the
river
to
rejoin
the
small
caravel
and
to
proceed
up
the
river
hoping
to
meet
with
a
more
civilized
people
than
had
been
seen
in
the
almadias
in
this
way
we
sailed
up
the
river
one
after
the
other
the
small
caravel
leading
and
when
we
had
got
about
four
miles
up
we
perceived
ourselves
to
be
followed
by
a
number
of
without
knowing
whence
they
came
on
this
we
tacked
about
and
bore
down
towards
the
almadias
having
first
fortified
ourselves
in
the
best
manner
we
could
to
defend
us
against
their
poisoned
arrows
and
made
every
thing
ready
for
battle
in
case
of
need
though
by
no
means
well
provided
with
arms
our
order
of
sailing
was
now
reversed
and
my
ship
was
foremost
in
going
down
the
river
we
soon
came
to
the
almadias
which
separated
into
two
divisions
having
my
ship
between
them
when
i
had
an
opportunity
to
count
their
numbers
as
they
gave
over
rowing
raised
their
oars
and
gazed
in
wonder
at
our
ship
there
were
in
all
fifteen
almadias
of
considerable
length
having
from
to
negroes
all
well
made
of
a
good
size
and
very
black
they
wore
white
cotton
shirts
having
white
caps
like
those
worn
by
the
germans
on
their
heads
but
with
a
wing
on
each
side
and
a
feather
in
the
middle
which
i
supposed
to
be
a
distinguishing
mark
of
their
being
soldiers
there
stood
a
negro
on
the
prow
of
each
almadia
having
a
round
target
apparently
of
leather
on
his
arm
and
for
some
time
they
neither
attacked
us
nor
we
them
when
they
saw
the
other
caravels
bearing
down
upon
them
they
dropped
their
oars
and
taking
up
their
bows
sent
a
flight
of
arrows
on
board
seeing
this
attack
our
ships
discharged
four
pieces
of
cannon
at
them
and
they
were
so
stupified
by
the
report
that
they
threw
down
their
bows
and
stared
about
in
amazement
at
the
effect
which
the
stones
from
the
cannon
made
on
the
water
around
them
they
continued
in
this
astonishment
for
some
time
but
seeing
that
the
cannon
ceased
to
fire
they
plucked
up
courage
and
renewed
the
fight
advancing
within
a
stones
throw
of
the
ship
on
this
our
sailors
began
to
use
their
and
the
first
shot
which
was
made
by
the
natural
son
of
the
genoese
gentleman
hit
a
negro
on
the
breast
who
instantly
fell
down
dead
those
in
the
almadia
where
he
fell
took
up
the
dart
and
gazed
at
it
with
wonder
yet
they
continued
the
attack
with
great
vigour
and
were
courageously
opposed
by
our
caravels
insomuch
that
many
of
the
negroes
were
soon
killed
without
the
loss
of
one
man
on
our
side
the
negroes
now
changed
their
mode
of
attack
and
made
a
furious
united
attack
on
the
stern
of
our
smallest
caravel
which
was
both
ill
manned
and
insufficiently
armed
on
observing
this
i
brought
up
my
ship
to
her
assistance
and
the
other
large
caravel
doing
the
same
we
placed
the
small
one
between
us
and
we
all
vigorously
plied
our
cannon
and
against
the
almadias
which
were
at
last
forced
to
retire
we
now
linked
all
the
three
caravels
together
and
dropped
one
anchor
which
was
sufficient
for
us
all
as
it
was
calm
weather
and
the
current
by
no
means
strong
we
next
endeavoured
to
enter
into
some
conversation
with
the
negroes
and
often
hailed
them
by
means
of
our
interpreters
at
length
one
of
the
almadias
drew
near
and
on
being
asked
the
reason
of
their
hostility
to
strangers
who
came
among
them
only
to
trade
in
a
friendly
manner
as
they
had
already
done
with
the
negroes
of
the
kingdom
of
senegal
and
were
desirous
of
being
on
the
same
friendly
terms
with
them
if
they
thought
proper
and
were
come
from
a
far
distant
country
with
presents
for
their
king
or
lord
from
the
king
of
portugal
who
was
desirous
of
peace
and
friendship
with
them
our
interpreters
also
entreated
the
negroes
to
inform
us
what
country
we
were
in
who
was
their
king
and
what
was
the
name
of
the
river
and
desired
them
to
come
freely
on
board
and
take
what
goods
they
pleased
adding
that
they
might
make
a
return
in
any
commodities
they
thought
proper
and
in
any
quantities
they
pleased
or
might
have
our
goods
for
nothing
to
all
this
they
made
answer
that
they
had
some
intelligence
of
the
christians
already
and
of
their
dealings
with
the
negroes
of
senegal
who
must
be
very
wicked
people
for
entering
into
friendship
with
them
as
they
were
well
assured
the
christians
were
meneaters
who
bought
the
negroes
only
to
devour
them
and
for
this
reason
they
were
resolved
to
have
no
correspondence
with
them
except
to
destroy
them
and
then
to
send
their
effects
to
their
lord
who
dwelt
three
days
journey
up
the
country
they
added
that
the
name
of
their
country
was
gambra
but
i
have
forgotten
the
name
they
gave
the
river
at
this
time
a
brisk
breeze
sprung
up
and
as
we
now
thoroughly
knew
the
hostile
dispositions
of
the
negroes
we
bore
down
upon
their
almadias
but
they
fled
to
the
shore
and
we
dropt
down
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
while
we
remained
off
the
mouth
of
this
river
we
only
once
saw
the
north
star
in
clear
weather
and
it
was
then
so
low
as
hardly
to
appear
above
the
height
of
a
lance
above
the
sea
we
likewise
observed
in
about
the
same
elevation
due
south
by
the
compass
a
constellation
of
six
large
bright
stars
in
the
figure
of
a
cross
in
this
form
we
conjectured
this
to
be
the
but
could
not
expect
to
observe
the
principal
star
as
we
had
not
yet
lost
sight
of
the
north
pole
in
this
place
on
the
of
july
we
found
the
night
to
be
eleven
hours
and
a
half
long
and
the
day
twelve
hours
and
a
half
the
climate
is
always
hot
and
i
was
told
that
even
the
rain
in
the
inland
parts
falls
warm
in
consequence
of
the
great
heat
of
the
air
it
is
true
that
there
is
some
difference
of
the
heat
at
different
seasons
and
when
the
heat
is
a
little
diminished
the
natives
call
it
winter
the
rains
begin
in
july
and
continue
till
the
end
of
october
and
fall
every
day
about
noon
at
which
time
certain
clouds
arise
in
the
by
or
which
are
accompanied
by
prodigious
thunder
and
lightning
and
vast
torrents
of
rain
in
this
season
which
is
in
the
beginning
of
july
the
negroes
sow
their
grain
in
the
same
manner
with
the
people
in
senegal
their
provisions
consist
of
millet
pulse
flesh
and
milk
there
is
not
so
much
dawn
at
break
of
day
in
this
southern
latitude
as
with
us
in
italy
for
within
half
an
hour
after
the
darkness
of
the
night
begins
to
dispel
the
sun
appears
and
during
all
that
dawn
the
atmosphere
is
turbid
as
if
filled
with
smoke
and
the
moment
the
sun
appears
this
mist
is
dissipated
i
could
only
account
for
this
phenomenon
by
attributing
it
to
the
low
and
flat
surface
of
this
country
which
is
destitute
of
mountains
and
my
companions
were
of
a
similar
opinion
on
holding
a
consultation
among
the
commanders
of
the
three
caravels
we
came
to
a
resolution
of
proceeding
about
an
hundred
miles
up
the
river
in
hopes
of
meeting
with
a
less
ferocious
and
better
disposed
people
in
the
interior
than
those
we
had
encountered
at
the
mouth
of
this
river
but
the
sailors
were
impatient
to
return
home
without
incurring
any
farther
dangers
and
unanimously
and
loudly
refused
their
consent
to
our
determination
declaring
that
they
had
already
done
enough
for
the
present
voyage
upon
this
being
made
known
to
us
and
being
well
aware
that
seamen
are
of
headstrong
and
obstinate
dispositions
we
conceded
to
their
clamours
and
steered
next
day
for
cape
verd
on
our
return
to
portugal
cape
verd
is
about
miles
from
the
southern
mouth
of
the
river
senegal
so
that
the
voyagers
probably
anchored
every
night
within
sight
of
the
scarcely
known
e
this
is
erroneous
as
it
was
discovered
in
by
denis
fernandez
nine
years
clarke
it
is
necessary
to
be
cautious
with
respect
to
these
early
voyages
which
having
gone
through
various
transcriptions
and
translations
are
liable
to
numerous
errors

called

from
the
sequel
i
am
apt
to
conclude
that
this
second
river
is
the
barbasini
of
our
charts
and
that
the
river
named
barbasini
in
the
text
of
cada
mosto
is
that
named
in
modern
e
cada
mosto
betrays
strange
ignorance
of
the
previous
discoveries
of
the
portuguese

that
he
had
resided
some
time
with
don

at

fine

discovered
in
nine
years
before
by
nuno
tristan
who
ascended
it
some
way
and
was
slain
there
by
the
poisoned
arrows
of
the
negroes
perhaps
even
don
henry
was
misled
by
the
name
of
rio
grande
which
it
then
received
and
confused
the
venetian
in
his
search
for
the
clarke
from
this
it
would
appear
that
gambra
or
gambia
is
the
name
of
the
country
not
of
the

that

always
call

as
i
could
say
little
or
nothing
about
the
condition
of
the
country
of
gambia
on
my
return
to
portugal
on
account
of
being
obliged
to
leave
it
so
suddenly
partly
owing
to
the
intractable
and
fierce
disposition
of
the
natives
and
partly
through
the
perversity
of
our
sailors
who
refused
to
proceed
in
exploring
the
river
the
genoese
gentleman
antonio
who
had
been
with
me
in
the
former
voyage
and
i
resolved
next
season
to
fit
out
two
caravels
in
order
to
return
to
the
river
gambia
and
don
henry
who
was
much
pleased
with
our
intentions
determined
to
send
one
of
his
caravels
along
with
us
every
thing
being
made
ready
for
our
voyage
we
sailed
from
lagos
near
cape
st
vincent
with
a
favourable
wind
in
the
beginning
of
may
and
steered
for
the
canaries
which
we
made
in
a
few
days
but
as
the
wind
continued
favourable
we
did
not
touch
there
and
continued
our
course
to
the
southward
and
as
we
were
favoured
by
a
current
setting
to
the
we
sailed
on
at
a
great
rate
at
last
we
came
in
sight
of
cape
branco
keeping
well
out
at
sea
and
on
the
following
night
we
were
assailed
by
a
great
storm
from
the
which
occasioned
us
to
steer
by
for
two
days
and
three
nights
in
order
to
weather
the
tempest
rather
than
turn
back
on
the
third
day
to
our
great
joy
and
surprise
we
descried
land
being
much
astonished
to
discover
land
in
a
quarter
where
no
person
could
have
expected
it
two
men
were
immediately
sent
aloft
who
cried
out
that
two
large
islands
were
in
sight
this
news
was
communicated
through
the
ships
to
our
great
satisfaction
as
we
were
sensible
these
islands
were
unknown
in
portugal
judging
it
probable
that
these
islands
might
be
inhabited
and
eager
to
try
our
fortune
we
steered
towards
one
of
them
which
we
soon
came
up
with
and
sailed
round
a
part
of
it
till
we
found
safe
anchorage
the
weather
being
now
much
calmed
we
sent
our
boat
on
shore
well
manned
and
armed
the
men
landed
and
having
examined
some
part
of
the
island
brought
back
word
that
they
could
meet
with
no
signs
of
inhabitants
whatever
next
morning
to
clear
up
all
doubts
i
sent
ten
men
to
land
on
the
island
well
armed
with
guns
and
whom
i
ordered
to
go
to
the
top
of
some
mountains
within
sight
and
to
look
from
thence
not
only
for
people
but
for
more
islands
these
men
executed
my
commands
but
found
no
appearance
of
any
inhabitants
they
found
however
an
incredible
number
of
pigeons
which
were
so
tame
being
strangers
to
man
that
they
readily
allowed
themselves
to
be
caught
and
our
people
brought
great
numbers
of
them
to
the
caravels
but
what
was
of
much
more
importance
they
brought
intelligence
of
having
discovered
three
other
islands
one
of
which
being
to
leeward
towards
the
north
could
not
be
seen
from
the
ships
while
the
other
two
lay
to
the
south
all
within
sight
of
each
other
these
men
likewise
noticed
something
resembling
islands
towards
the
west
but
at
so
great
a
distance
that
they
could
not
be
clearly
distinguished
neither
did
i
think
proper
to
sail
in
that
direction
lest
i
should
lose
time
in
visiting
uninhabited
islands
like
this
at
which
we
had
touched
the
fame
of
my
discovery
of
these
four
islands
brought
other
navigators
afterwards
to
explore
this
group
who
round
them
to
be
ten
in
number
both
large
and
small
included
and
altogether
uninhabited
except
by
pigeons
and
other
birds
and
having
a
fine
fishery
leaving
the
first
island
we
came
in
sight
of
the
other
two
and
searched
for
an
anchoring
place
near
one
of
them
which
was
full
of
trees
discovering
the
mouth
of
a
river
and
being
in
want
of
water
we
came
to
anchor
and
sent
our
boats
on
shore
to
supply
our
wants
some
of
our
people
went
a
little
way
up
the
river
where
they
found
some
small
lakes
containing
remarkably
fine
white
salt
of
which
they
brought
large
quantities
to
the
ships
laying
in
what
store
was
thought
necessary
as
we
did
likewise
of
water
we
found
here
great
numbers
of
tortoises
or
turtle
the
shells
of
which
were
larger
than
a
target
the
sailors
cooked
these
into
different
dishes
as
they
had
done
before
in
the
gulf
of
arguin
where
these
animals
are
found
in
plenty
but
not
so
large
as
here
out
of
curiosity
i
eat
some
of
the
flesh
of
these
tortoises
which
seemed
very
good
having
a
good
smell
and
taste
and
was
not
inferior
to
veal
we
salted
a
great
number
of
them
which
proved
a
valuable
addition
to
our
stock
of
provisions
during
the
voyage
we
caught
likewise
a
prodigious
quantity
of
fish
both
off
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
in
the
stream
and
though
we
knew
not
the
kinds
they
were
large
and
the
mouth
of
this
river
is
a
good
across
and
it
is
deep
enough
to
admit
a
vessel
of
tons
we
remained
two
days
in
this
place
for
refreshments
taking
in
a
good
stock
of
tortoises
and
fish
and
large
quantities
of
pigeons
which
we
killed
without
number
to
the
first
island
at
which
we
anchored
we
gave
the
name
of
as
being
the
first
we
got
sight
of
and
to
this
other
which
seemed
the
largest
of
the
four
the
name
of
st
jago
having
cast
anchor
there
on
the
day
of
st
philip
and
st
james
every
thing
being
in
readiness
for
pursuing
our
voyage
we
took
our
departure
from
these
islands
and
shaped
our
course
for
cape
verd
we
arrived
at
and
keeping
within
sight
of
land
we
came
to
a
place
named
the
which
is
between
cape
verd
and
the
river
senegal
being
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
coast
we
doubled
the
cape
next
day
and
came
once
more
to
the
river
gambia
into
which
we
immediately
entered
and
finding
no
opposition
from
the
negroes
or
their
almadias
we
sailed
up
the
river
always
by
day
and
continually
sounding
such
of
the
almadias
as
we
saw
on
the
river
kept
at
a
distance
close
to
the
banks
of
the
river
and
never
ventured
to
approach
about
ten
miles
up
the
river
we
cast
anchor
on
a
sunday
morning
at
an
island
where
one
of
our
sailors
was
buried
who
had
died
of
a
fever
and
as
his
name
happened
to
be
andrew
we
called
it
the
island
of
st
andrew
leaving
this
island
we
proceeded
up
the
river
followed
by
some
of
the
negroes
in
their
almadias
yet
always
keeping
at
a
considerable
distance
our
interpreters
often
hailed
them
and
shewed
them
various
trinkets
which
were
offered
for
their
acceptance
and
endeavoured
to
entice
them
to
come
near
by
telling
them
that
we
were
civilized
people
from
whom
they
had
nothing
to
fear
wrought
upon
by
these
representations
the
negroes
at
length
approached
and
came
up
with
my
caravel
and
at
last
one
of
them
who
understood
the
language
of
our
interpreter
came
on
board
he
was
greatly
surprized
at
every
thing
he
saw
in
and
about
the
caravel
especially
with
the
sails
and
rigging
having
no
other
idea
of
moving
a
vessel
on
the
water
but
by
means
of
oars
he
was
no
less
amazed
at
our
colour
and
dress
as
his
nation
mostly
go
stark
naked
or
with
a
single
white
cotton
shirt
as
their
sole
dress
we
were
exceedingly
kind
and
attentive
to
this
negro
and
made
him
many
presents
of
trinkets
and
other
things
of
small
value
with
which
he
was
much
delighted
i
asked
him
many
questions
respecting
the
country
through
our
interpreter
and
at
length
learnt
that
we
were
in
the
country
of
gambia
of
which
forosangoli
was
chief
lord
and
by
what
we
could
learn
from
him
the
residence
of
forosangoli
was
at
the
distance
of
nine
or
ten
days
journey
in
a
direction
between
the
south
and
the
southwest
he
said
that
forosangoli
was
tributary
to
the
king
of
melli
who
is
the
great
emperor
of
the
negroes
that
there
were
many
inferior
lords
who
dwelt
near
the
river
on
both
sides
and
if
we
pleased
he
would
conduct
us
to
the
residence
of
one
of
these
lords
named
battimansa
and
would
endeavour
to
negociate
a
treaty
of
peace
and
friendship
between
him
and
us
being
much
pleased
with
this
offer
we
carried
this
negro
along
with
us
and
treated
him
with
much
attention
and
sailing
up
the
river
we
came
to
the
place
where
battimansa
resided
which
in
my
opinion
was
above
forty
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
river
in
going
up
the
river
into
which
several
lesser
rivers
fall
we
sailed
to
the
eastwards
and
at
the
place
where
we
came
to
anchor
we
found
it
much
narrower
than
at
the
mouth
being
not
above
a
mile
in
breadth
by
our
estimation
on
coming
to
this
place
we
sent
one
of
our
interpreters
and
the
native
negro
to
battimansa
with
a
present
of
a
handsome
garment
called
an
made
of
moorish
silk
in
the
form
of
a
shirt
and
they
were
desired
to
inform
him
of
the
reason
of
our
coming
into
his
country
signifying
that
the
christian
king
of
portugal
had
sent
us
thither
to
enter
into
a
treaty
of
friendship
and
peace
with
him
and
that
if
he
had
any
call
for
our
commodities
our
king
would
supply
him
with
them
every
year
as
soon
as
our
messengers
had
discharged
their
commission
battimansa
sent
some
of
his
negroes
to
the
caravel
with
whom
we
entered
into
friendship
and
bartered
several
things
for
negro
slaves
and
some
gold
but
gold
was
by
no
means
to
be
had
in
any
thing
like
the
plenty
we
expected
from
the
account
given
of
this
country
by
the
natives
of
senegal
who
being
themselves
extremely
poor
consider
that
to
be
a
large
quantity
which
we
think
very
trifling
the
negroes
value
their
gold
as
a
very
precious
thing
even
at
a
higher
rate
than
the
portuguese
yet
we
got
it
in
barter
very
reasonably
for
things
of
very
small
value
we
continued
here
eleven
days
during
which
the
caravels
were
continually
resorted
to
by
great
numbers
of
negroes
from
both
sides
of
the
river
who
came
to
see
the
novelties
and
to
sell
their
goods
among
which
there
were
a
few
gold
rings
part
of
their
commodities
consisted
of
cotton
cloth
and
cotton
yarn
some
of
the
pieces
being
all
white
some
striped
blue
and
white
and
others
again
with
red
blue
and
white
stripes
all
very
well
wrought
and
coloured
they
likewise
brought
civet
for
sale
the
skins
of
monkies
large
and
small
baboons
of
various
sorts
and
these
last
being
very
plenty
they
sold
them
cheap
or
for
something
not
exceeding
ten
in
value
for
each
and
the
ounce
of
civet
for
what
was
not
worth
more
than
forty
or
fifty
marquets
not
that
they
sold
their
commodities
by
weight
but
i
judged
the
quantity
to
be
about
an
ounce
other
negroes
brought
various
sorts
of
fruit
for
sale
among
which
were
many
small
wild
dates
which
they
seemed
to
think
much
of
but
which
our
people
thought
not
good
as
the
taste
was
different
from
those
of
europe
as
for
me
i
would
not
venture
to
eat
any
of
them
lest
they
might
have
given
me
the
flux
or
some
other
distemper
our
ships
were
every
day
crowded
with
people
of
different
aspects
and
languages
and
the
natives
were
continually
going
up
and
down
the
river
from
one
place
to
another
both
men
and
women
in
their
almadias
they
have
no
sails
and
propel
their
almadias
entirely
with
oars
which
they
use
on
both
sides
all
the
rowers
standing
up
one
man
stands
at
the
stern
who
rows
sometimes
on
one
side
sometimes
on
the
other
to
keep
the
almadia
steady
in
her
course
they
have
no
pins
or
locks
to
steady
their
oars
but
hold
them
fast
with
both
hands
their
oar
being
a
pole
like
a
half
lance
seven
feet
and
a
half
long
with
a
round
board
like
a
trencher
fastened
to
one
end
and
with
these
they
row
with
great
safety
and
swiftness
in
the
mouths
of
their
rivers
which
are
very
numerous
but
they
seldom
go
out
to
sea
or
to
any
distance
from
their
own
coasts
lest
they
should
be
taken
by
their
neighbours
and
sold
for
slaves
there
is
some
difficulty
respecting
the
date
of
this
second
voyage
in
the
former
cada
mosto
sailed
from
portugal
in
march
in
the
course
of
his
proceedings
the
month
of
november
is
mentioned
and
some
subsequent
transactions
are
said
to
have
happened
in
july
which
on
this
arrangement
must
necessarily
have
been
of
the
year
if
therefore
the
dates
of
the
former
voyage
be
accurate
the
second
ought
to
have
been
dated
in
e
this
part
of
the
narrative
is
involved
in
difficulty
and
most
be
erroneous
a
storm
from
the
off
cape
branco
almost
in
lat
and
a
course
could
not
possibly
lead
to
the
discovery
of
the
cape
verd
islands
almost
six
degrees
farther
south
and
at
least
six
degrees
farther
west
this
difficulty
may
be
solved
by
supposing
the
storm
from
the
and
that
the
ships
drove
to
the
from
off
cape
e
this
passage
alludes
to
the
voyage
of
antonio
de
noli
in
and
it
may
be
remarked
that
de
faria
who
mentions
the
discovery
of
these
islands
by
noli
takes
no
notice
of
the
actual
discovery
by
cada
mosto
astl
the
editor
of
astleys
collection
considers
this
as
having
been
st
jameses
island
which
is
about
twenty
miles
up
the
gambia
but
there
is
a
small
island
near
the
northern
bank
now
called
charles
which
exactly
corresponds
with
the
distance
in
the
e
according
to
our
best
maps
or
charts
of
the
gambia
this
river
is
never
less
than
four
miles
broad
and
generally
above
five
till
we
get
near
miles
up
the
river
to
the
reach
which
encircles
the
devils
point
where
it
still
is
two
miles
wide
it
is
possible
that
the
original
journal
of
cada
mosto
may
have
had
leagues
of
three
marine
miles
each
in
which
case
the
residence
of
battimansa
may
have
been
at
or
near
the
devils
point
above
miles
up
the
e
though
this
country
will
be
amply
described
in
other
voyages
in
our
collection
it
may
be
proper
to
remark
that
both
sides
of
the
river
gambia
are
inhabited
by
a
mixed
population
of
three
nations
the
feloops
foleys
and
mandingoes
each
of
whom
have
their
own
separate
villages
interspersed
this
population
is
divided
into
many
states
lordships
or
little
kingdoms
as
joalli
barrah
kolar
badibu
barsalli

or
near
the

bank

jagra
yamini
on
the
e
section
ix
account
of
the
manners
and
customs
on
the
gambia
and
of
the
elephant
and
it
now
remains
for
me
to
relate
what
i
observed
and
was
informed
of
concerning
this
country
during
my
short
stay
the
religion
of
the
negroes
of
gambia
consists
of
various
kinds
of
idolatry
they
place
great
reliance
on
sorcery
and
other
diabolical
things
yet
all
believe
in
god
there
are
many
mahometans
among
them
who
trade
to
many
countries
yet
are
not
settled
in
houses
because
the
natives
are
ignorant
they
live
very
much
in
the
same
manner
with
the
natives
of
senegal
and
have
the
same
kinds
of
provisions
but
they
cultivate
more
sorts
of
rice
they
eat
dogs
flesh
which
i
never
heard
of
being
used
anywhere
else
they
are
clothed
in
cotton
garments
and
have
great
abundance
of
cotton
in
their
country
which
may
be
the
reason
of
the
gambians
not
going
naked
as
those
of
senegal
do
where
cotton
is
very
scarce
the
women
dress
in
the
same
manner
and
when
they
are
very
young
take
great
delight
in
delineating
figures
on
their
necks
breasts
and
arms
with
the
point
of
a
hot
needle
which
are
never
obliterated
and
which
resemble
the
flowers
and
ornaments
which
are
wrought
on
silk
handkerchiefs
the
country
is
excessively
hot
and
the
heat
increases
as
we
go
to
the
south
besides
which
we
found
it
much
hotter
up
the
river
than
at
sea
owing
to
the
immense
number
of
trees
with
which
the
country
everywhere
abounds
some
of
these
trees
are
of
very
great
dimensions
near
a
spring
where
our
sailors
were
in
use
to
fill
our
water
casks
not
far
from
the
banks
of
the
river
there
grew
an
exceedingly
large
tree
but
its
height
was
by
no
means
proportional
to
its
thickness
for
though
it
measured
seventeen
cubits
in
girth
near
the
ground
its
height
by
estimation
was
only
twenty
paces
this
tree
was
hollow
but
the
branches
were
very
large
avid
extended
to
a
great
distance
forming
a
thick
and
ample
shade
but
there
were
many
other
trees
much
larger
than
this
by
which
the
richness
and
fertility
of
the
soil
may
be
easily
conceived
and
the
country
is
intersected
by
numerous
streams
there
are
many
elephants
in
this
country
but
the
natives
are
ignorant
of
the
art
of
taming
these
animals
as
is
practised
in
other
countries
one
day
while
we
lay
at
anchor
in
the
middle
of
the
river
we
observed
three
elephants
come
out
from
the
wood
and
walk
by
the
river
side
on
which
we
sent
our
boat
with
some
of
the
people
towards
them
but
they
immediately
returned
into
the
wood
these
were
all
i
ever
saw
alive
but
sometime
afterwards
one
of
the
negro
lords
shewed
me
a
dead
young
elephant
which
he
had
killed
after
a
chase
of
two
days
the
negroes
hunt
on
foot
in
the
woods
using
only
arrows
and
assagays
or
javelins
which
are
all
poisoned
when
they
hunt
the
elephant
they
conceal
themselves
behind
trees
and
even
sometimes
mount
to
their
tops
leaping
from
one
tree
to
another
in
pursuit
of
the
elephant
which
being
a
large
unweildy
animal
is
often
wounded
in
many
places
before
it
can
turn
round
or
place
itself
in
a
posture
of
defence
but
in
an
open
field
no
person
dare
attack
one
nor
could
even
the
swiftest
escape
from
their
pursuit
as
i
have
been
informed
by
many
of
the
negroes
the
teeth
of
this
dead
elephant
which
was
shewn
me
by
one
of
which
still
remained
in
the
jaw
did
not
exceed
three
spans
long
which
distinctly
shews
that
it
was
quite
young
in
comparison
of
those
whose
teeth
are
from
ten
to
twelve
spans
in
length
yet
small
as
it
was
for
an
elephant
we
computed
that
the
weight
of
its
carcass
was
equal
to
five
or
six
oxen
made
me
a
present
of
what
part
of
this
elephant
i
liked
best
and
gave
the
remainder
to
his
huntsmen
to
feast
on
understanding
that
elephants
flesh
was
eaten
by
the
negroes
i
had
some
both
roasted
and
boiled
of
which
i
tasted
that
i
might
be
able
to
say
that
i
had
fed
upon
the
flesh
of
an
animal
which
had
never
been
eaten
by
any
of
my
countrymen
but
i
found
it
hard
and
of
an
unpleasant
relish
i
brought
one
of
the
legs
and
a
part
of
the
trunk
on
board
our
caravel
together
with
some
of
the
hair
from
its
body
which
was
a
span
and
a
half
long
of
a
black
colour
and
very
thick
on
my
return
to
portugal
i
presented
this
hair
to
don
henry
together
with
a
part
of
the
flesh
salted
up
for
that
express
purpose
which
he
received
with
much
satisfaction
as
it
was
the
first
of
the
kind
that
had
been
brought
from
the
countries
that
were
discovered
under
his
auspices
the
foot
of
the
elephant
is
round
like
that
of
a
horse
but
without
hoofs
instead
of
which
it
is
covered
by
a
very
thick
hard
black
skin
and
defended
by
five
nails
on
the
fore
part
which
are
round
and
of
the
size
of
a
though
young
the
foot
of
this
elephant
measured
a
span
and
a
half
in
diameter
from
the
same
negro
lord
i
received
the
foot
of
a
elephant
the
sole
of
which
was
three
spans
and
an
inch
in
diameter
which
together
with
a
tooth
of
twelve
spans
long
i
presented
to
don
henry
on
my
return
who
sent
it
afterwards
as
a
great
curiosity
to
the
dutchess
of
burgundy
in
the
river
gambia
and
in
other
rivers
on
this
coast
besides
the
and
other
animals
there
is
one
called
the
or
hippopotamus
of
the
same
nature
almost
with
the
sea
cow
and
which
lives
both
on
land
and
in
the
water
this
animal
is
as
large
in
the
body
as
a
cow
with
very
short
legs
and
cloven
feet
having
a
large
head
like
that
of
a
horse
and
two
huge
teeth
like
the
tusks
of
a
wild
boar
some
of
which
i
have
seen
upwards
of
two
spans
long
this
animal
when
it
gets
out
of
the
river
walks
on
the
land
like
any
other
fourfooted
beast
and
so
far
as
i
know
was
never
before
discovered
by
any
christian
traveller
except
perhaps
in
the
nile
we
saw
likewise
a
number
of
bats
or
rather
owls
upwards
of
three
spans
long
and
many
other
birds
quite
different
from
those
of
our
country
both
in
appearance
and
taste
yet
very
good
to
eat
the
meaning
of
this
expression
is
obscure
perhaps
it
implies
that
their
mahometan
teachers
had
no
mosques
because
the
negroes
were
ignorant
of
the
means
and
method
of
construction
the
knowledge
of
god
among
the
northern
negroes
was
assuredly
due
exclusively
to
the
mahometan
e
called
in
grynaeus
according
to
jobson
mensa
or
mansa
signifies
a
king
in
the
mandingo
astl
a
venetian
silver
coin
not
exceeding
a
silver
astl
this
animal
is
nowhere
explained
perhaps

section
x
of
the
voyage
from
the
gambia
to
the
river
cape
roxo
the
rivers
of
st
ann
and
st
domingo
and
the
rio
having
continued
eleven
days
in
the
river
gambia
and
many
of
our
people
becoming
affected
by
acute
fevers
we
dropt
down
the
river
on
the
evening
of
the
eleventh
day
departing
from
the
country
of
and
got
out
of
the
river
in
a
few
days
so
stocked
with
commodities
as
to
encourage
us
to
proceed
farther
and
indeed
having
been
so
far
successful
and
having
a
plentiful
supply
of
provisions
and
every
thing
necessary
for
prosecuting
the
voyage
we
considered
as
incumbent
on
us
to
attempt
some
farther
discoveries
towards
the
south
we
accordingly
steered
southwards
with
a
favourable
wind
but
finding
the
land
to
run
a
considerable
way
to
the
from
the
mouth
of
the
gambia
to
a
certain
point
which
we
took
for
a
cape
we
stood
out
to
the
west
to
gain
the
open
sea
the
whole
coast
to
the
south
of
the
gambia
being
low
and
covered
with
trees
to
the
waters
edge
on
gaining
an
offing
we
found
that
the
beforementioned
point
was
no
actual
cape
or
promontory
as
the
shore
appeared
perfectly
straight
on
the
other
side
yet
we
kept
at
some
distance
out
to
sea
as
we
observed
breakers
for
several
miles
out
to
sea
on
this
account
we
had
to
proceed
with
great
caution
keeping
always
two
men
at
the
head
of
the
ship
and
one
in
the
to
look
out
for
shoals
and
breakers
and
as
a
farther
precaution
we
sailed
only
during
the
day
and
came
to
anchor
every
night
in
this
cautious
progress
our
caravels
sailed
always
one
before
the
other
having
fixed
the
order
of
sailing
by
lot
and
changed
the
leader
every
day
in
order
to
avoid
all
disputes
at
the
end
of
two
days
sail
in
this
manner
always
in
sight
of
land
we
discovered
on
the
third
day
the
mouth
of
a
river
about
half
a
mile
wide
and
towards
evening
we
observed
a
little
gulf
or
inlet
which
we
supposed
might
be
the
entrance
of
another
river
but
as
it
grew
late
we
came
to
anchor
for
the
night
next
morning
we
sailed
into
this
gulf
and
found
that
it
was
the
mouth
of
a
large
river
not
a
great
deal
less
in
my
opinion
than
the
gambia
and
both
its
banks
were
full
of
very
beautiful
tall
trees
we
cast
anchor
within
the
mouth
of
this
river
and
agreed
to
send
two
armed
boats
on
shore
with
our
interpreters
to
get
intelligence
respecting
the
country
according
to
our
usual
practice
this
was
done
accordingly
and
our
interpreters
brought
back
word
that
the
river
was
called
kasamansa
from
a
negro
lord
of
that
name
who
resided
at
a
place
about
thirty
miles
up
the
river
but
who
was
absent
from
his
residence
on
a
warlike
expedition
against
the
lord
of
a
neighbouring
territory
on
receiving
this
intelligence
we
sailed
from
this
river
next
day
without
attempting
any
traffic
with
the
natives
this
river
of
kasamansa
is
leagues
or
miles
to
the
south
of
the
gambia
standing
on
about
miles
farther
we
came
to
a
cape
which
is
a
little
more
elevated
than
the
rest
of
the
coast
and
as
its
front
had
a
red
colour
we
named
it
cape
or
proceeding
forwards
we
came
to
the
mouth
of
a
pretty
large
river
about
a
wide
which
we
did
not
enter
but
to
which
we
gave
the
name
of
the
river
of
st
ann
farther
on
still
we
came
to
the
mouth
of
another
river
not
less
than
the
former
which
we
named
st
dominic
or
st
domingo
distant
from
cape
rosso
by
our
estimation
between
and
sixty
miles
in
another
days
sailing
we
came
to
a
very
large
river
which
at
first
appeared
to
be
a
gulf
and
was
judged
to
be
about
twenty
miles
in
breadth
but
we
could
observe
the
beautiful
trees
on
the
south
side
and
it
took
us
a
considerable
time
to
sail
across
to
that
side
on
getting
over
to
that
side
we
observed
several
islands
in
the
sea
and
as
we
wished
to
procure
some
intelligence
concerning
the
country
we
came
to
an
anchor
next
morning
two
almadias
came
off
to
us
from
the
land
one
of
which
was
as
long
as
a
caravel
and
carried
about
thirty
hands
the
other
was
smaller
and
was
manned
by
sixteen
negroes
they
came
towards
us
with
great
eagerness
and
not
knowing
what
might
be
their
design
we
took
to
our
arms
and
waited
their
approach
as
they
drew
near
they
fixed
a
white
cloth
to
the
end
of
an
oar
which
they
held
up
as
a
signal
of
peace
and
we
answered
them
in
a
similar
manner
the
negroes
then
came
alongside
of
our
ships
the
largest
of
the
almadias
coming
up
to
the
caravel
in
which
i
was
they
gazed
at
every
thing
they
saw
examining
the
form
of
the
ship
the
masts
yards
sails
and
rigging
with
much
attention
and
they
seemed
astonished
at
seeing
the
white
colour
of
our
people
our
interpreters
spoke
to
them
in
order
to
learn
the
name
of
the
country
but
could
not
understand
a
word
of
their
language
which
was
a
great
mortification
to
us
as
we
were
obliged
to
leave
the
place
without
getting
any
intelligence
but
we
purchased
a
few
gold
rings
from
one
of
the
negroes
agreeing
about
the
price
by
signs
finding
ourselves
in
a
country
where
our
interpreters
were
of
no
use
and
considering
therefore
that
it
would
be
to
no
purpose
for
us
to
proceed
any
farther
we
determined
to
return
we
stayed
two
days
in
the
mouth
of
this
large
river
which
we
therefore
named
rio
grande
and
where
we
found
the
north
pole
very
low
in
this
place
we
found
great
irregularity
in
the
tides
for
whereas
at
venice
and
all
other
places
in
europe
the
flux
and
reflux
are
each
of
six
hours
continuance
the
tide
here
only
flows
four
hours
and
ebbs
eight
and
the
violence
of
the
flowing
tide
is
quite
incredible
insomuch
that
we
had
great
difficulty
to
stem
it
with
three
anchors
nay
such
was
its
impetuosity
that
we
were
sometimes
obliged
to
hoist
our
sails
and
even
then
it
exceeded
the
force
of
the
wind
taking
our
departure
from
the
mouth
of
this
vast
river
on
our
way
back
to
portugal
we
directed
our
course
to
two
large
islands
and
some
small
ones
which
lay
about
thirty
miles
distance
from
the
continent
which
we
found
quite
low
yet
full
of
large
and
beautiful
green
trees
and
inhabited
by
negroes
encountering
here
the
same
difficulty
of
intercourse
for
want
of
knowing
their
language
we
made
no
stop
but
took
our
departure
for
portugal
where
we
arrived
in
safety
at
this

dubious

to

was
accompanied
by
a
young
portuguese
who

formerly
been
clerk
to

in
his
two
voyages
and
who
on
the
return
of
the

to

came
to
the
house
of
his
former
employer
who
then
continued
to
reside
at

and
gave
him
an
account
of
the
discoveries
which
had
been
made
in
this
new
voyage
and
the
names
of
all
the
places
which
had

beginning
from
the

the
extreme
point

first
went
to
the
two
large
inhabited
islands
at
the
mouth
of
the
rio
grande
which
i
had
discovered
in
my
second
voyage
where
he
landed
and
ordered
his
interpreters
to
make
the
usual
inquiries
at
the
inhabitants
but
they
could
not
make
themselves
understood
nor
could
they
understand
the
language
of
the
natives
going
therefore
into
the
interior
they
found
the
habitations
of
the
negroes
to
consist
of
poor
thatched
cabins
in
some
of
which
they
found
wooden
idols
which
were
worshipped
by
the
negroes
being
unable
to
procure
any
information
in
this
place
cintra
proceeded
in
his
voyage
along
the
coast
and
came
to
the
mouth
of
a
large
river
between
three
and
four
miles
wide
which
he
called
besegue
from
a
lord
of
that
name
who
dwelt
near
its
mouth
and
which
he
reckoned
to
be
about
forty
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
rio
grande
proceeding
about
miles
from
the
river
besegue
along
a
very
hilly
coast
clothed
with
high
trees
and
having
a
very
beautiful
appearance
they
came
to
a
cape
to
which
they
gave
the
name
of
verga
continuing
along
the
coast
they
fell
in
with
another
cape
which
in
the
opinion
of
all
the
seamen
was
the
highest
they
had
ever
seen
having
a
sharp
conical
height
in
the
middle
like
a
diamond
yet
entirely
covered
with
beautiful
green
trees
after
the
name
of
the
fortress
of
sagres
which
was
built
by
the
deceased
don
henry
on
cape
st
vincent
the
portuguese
named
this
point
cape
sagres
of
guinea
according
to
the
account
of
the
sailors
the
inhabitants
of
this
coast
are
idolaters
worshipping
wooden
images
in
the
shape
of
men
before
which
they
make
offerings
of
victuals
as
often
as
they
eat
or
drink
these
people
are
more
of
a
tawny
colour
than
black
having
marks
on
their
faces
and
bodies
made
with
hot
irons
they
go
almost
entirely
naked
except
that
they
wear
pieces
of
the
bark
of
trees
before
them
they
have
no
arms
as
there
is
no
iron
in
their
country
they
live
on
rice
millet
beans
and
kidney
beans
larger
than
ours
and
have
also
beef
and
goats
flesh
but
not
in
any
great
abundance
near
to
cape
sagres
there
are
several
very
small
uninhabited
islands
the
inhabitants
of
this
river
have
large
almadias
carrying
from
thirty
to
forty
men
who
row
standing
without
having
their
oars
fixed
to
any
thing
as
formerly
noticed
they
have
their
ears
pierced
with
many
holes
in
which
they
wear
a
variety
of
gold
rings
both
men
and
women
have
also
a
hole
through
the
cartilage
of
the
nose
in
which
they
wear
a
gold
ring
just
like
that
of
iron
in
the
noses
of
our
buffalos
which
they
take
out
when
eating
the
ladies
belonging
to
the
kings
and
great
men
by
way
of
extraordinary
grandeur
have
gold
rings
on
other
parts
of
their
body
which
decorum
prevents
us
from
particularizing
passing
cape
sagres
they
sailed
about
forty
miles
farther
along
the
coast
and
came
to
the
rio
de
san
vincents
which
is
about
four
miles
wide
and
about
five
miles
farther
they
found
another
which
they
called
rio
verde
larger
at
the
mouth
than
the
former
both
of
these
rivers
were
so
named
by
the
sailors
in
the
caravels
about
miles
beyond
the
rio
verde
they
came
to
another
cape
which
they
called
signifying
the
because
of
the
beautifully
verdant
country
in
its
neighbourhood
from
cape
liedo
there
extends
a
large
mountain
for
about
fifty
miles
along
the
coast
all
of
which
is
very
high
and
covered
with
tall
verdant
trees
at
the
end
of
this
mountain
and
about
eight
miles
from
the
shore
there
are
three
small
islands
the
largest
of
which
does
not
exceed
ten
or
twelve
miles
in
circumference
to
these
the
sailors
gave
the
name
of
and
they
named
the
mountain
or
the
lion
mountain
on
account
of
the
continual
roaring
of
thunder
on
its
summit
which
is
always
enveloped
in
clouds
proceeding
beyond
sierra
leona
the
coast
was
quite
low
and
the
shore
full
of
sand
banks
running
out
into
the
sea
about
thirty
miles
from
the
southern
extremity
of
the
mountain
they
found
a
river
near
three
miles
wide
at
the
entrance
and
because
the
water
had
a
red
colour
they
called
it
rio
roxo
and
farther
on
they
found
a
cape
likewise
of
a
red
colour
which
they
named
cape
roxo
and
they
gave
the
same
name
of
roxo
to
a
small
uninhabited
island
about
ten
miles
off
at
sea
where
the
north
polar
star
seemed
only
the
height
of
a
man
above
the
horizon
beyond
cape
roxo
the
sea
forms
a
gulf
about
the
middle
of
which
there
enters
a
river
which
the
seamen
called
st
mary
del
nievos
or
of
the
snow
as
having
been
discovered
on
the
day
of
that
saint
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
there
is
a
cape
with
an
island
close
beside
it
this
gulf
is
full
of
sand
banks
running
ten
or
twelve
miles
along
the
coast
on
which
the
sea
breaks
with
considerable
violence
and
has
a
strong
current
both
in
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tide
and
the
little
island
just
mentioned
is
named
on
account
of
these
sand
banks
miles
distant
from
this
river
is
a
large
cape
called
st
ann
having
been
discovered
on
the
day
of
that
saint
and
the
whole
coast
between
is
low
with
very
shallow
water
miles
beyond
this
cape
is
the
river
of
so
named
from
the
abundance
of
these
trees
which
were
seen
there
the
mouth
of
this
river
though
of
sufficient
width
is
so
full
of
shoals
and
sand
banks
as
to
render
its
entrance
very
dangerous
about
seventy
miles
farther
on
there
is
another
small
river
called
de
or
smoke
river
so
named
because
at
the
time
of
its
discovery
they
saw
nothing
but
smoke
along
this
coast
made
by
the
negroes
beyond
this
river
about
miles
there
is
a
cape
which
runs
a
great
way
out
into
the
sea
on
which
stands
a
high
mountain
on
which
account
it
was
called
del
or
cape
mount
about
sixty
miles
still
farther
on
to
the
there
is
another
and
smaller
cape
on
which
is
a
small
mountain
or
hill
which
was
named
cape
or
the
first
night
after
their
arrival
at
this
place
the
voyagers
saw
many
fires
among
the
trees
made
by
the
negroes
on
seeing
the
ships
as
they
had
never
seen
such
objects
before
about
sixteen
miles
beyond
cape
misurado
there
is
a
large
forest
of
trees
close
to
the
shore
to
which
they
gave
the
name
of
st
mary
grove
the
caravels
came
to
anchor
beyond
this
wood
and
several
almadias
came
off
from
the
shore
towards
them
there
were
two
or
three
naked
negroes
in
each
having
sharp
pointed
sticks
in
their
hands
which
our
seamen
supposed
to
be
darts
some
of
them
had
small
knives
and
they
had
only
two
targets
and
three
bows
among
them
all
these
negroes
had
their
ears
and
noses
pierced
from
which
hung
some
strange
ornaments
resembling
human
teeth
the
interpreters
spoke
to
them
but
could
not
understand
their
language
three
of
these
negroes
ventured
on
board
one
of
the
caravels
one
of
whom
was
detained
by
the
portuguese
and
the
other
two
allowed
to
go
away
for
cintra
had
been
ordered
by
the
king
in
case
of
discovering
any
country
where
the
interpreters
did
not
understand
the
language
that
he
was
to
bring
away
one
of
the
natives
either
by
force
or
fair
means
that
he
might
be
able
to
give
an
account
of
his
country
either
by
some
of
the
negroes
in
portugal
happening
to
understand
his
language
or
after
he
had
acquired
the
portuguese
piedro
de
cintra
having
determined
to
proceed
no
farther
returned
back
to
portugal
from
cape
misarado
to
which
he
had
traced
the
coast
of
africa
from
the
rio
grande
upon
his
return
this
negro
who
had
been
detained
off
cape
misurado
was
examined
by
several
negroes
and
at
length
was
understood
by
a
negress
who
belonged
to
an
inhabitant
of
lisbon
not
indeed
by
his
own
proper
language
but
by
means
of
another
which
was
known
to
them
both
whatever
intelligence
may
have
been
procured
on
this
occasion
was
not
made
public
except
that
there
were
unicorns
in
his
country
after
this
negro
had
been
kept
for
some
months
in
lisbon
and
had
been
shewn
many
of
the
curiosities
of
portugal
the
king
ordered
him
to
be
supplied
with
clothes
and
sent
him
back
in
a
caravel
to
his
own
country
but
from
that
coast
no
other
ship
had
arrived
before
my
departure
which
was
on
the
first
of
february
for
this
exordium
or
introduction
we
are
indebted
to
the
editor
of
astley
collection
of
voyages
and
travels
said
to
have
been
a
mr
john
green
the
infant
don
henry
of
portugal
died
in
so
that
there
must
have
been
an
interval
of
six
or
seven
years
between
the
second
voyage
of
cada
mosto
and
this
of
piedro
de
cintra
though
de
faria
seems
to
put
this
voyage
as
having
been
executed
before
the
death
of
that
excellent
prince
yet
cada
mosto
who
then
actually
resided
at
lagos
could
not
be
mistaken
is
this
important
astl
in
a
note
to
the
second
voyage
of
cada
mosto
it
has
been
already
noticed
that
he
seems
to
have
given
the
name
of
rio
grande
to
the
channel
between
the
bissagos
islands
or
shoals
of
the
rio
grande
and
the
main
this
river
besegue
may
possibly
be
the
strait
or
channel
which
divides
the
island
named
particularly
bissagos
or
more
properly
bissao
from
that
of
bassis
or
bussi
yet
this
river
besegue
may
even
have
been
that
now
called
rio
grande
in
which
about
leagues
above
its
mouth
there
is
an
island
called
e
it
is
strange
that
the
rio
de
nuno
close
by
this
cape
the
estuary
of
which
is
not
less
than
seven
or
eight
miles
wide
should
be
here
omitted
but
the
present
voyage
is
very
superficially
narrated
e
the
text
is
here
obviously
defective
as
no
river
is
mentioned
before
but
the
allusion
must
be
to
the
river
pongo
pongue
or
pougue
at
the
mouth
of
which
cape
sagres
is
situated
indeed
that
cape
seems
to
be
formed
by
one
of
the
islands
off
the
mouth
of
the
e
there
are
a
number
of
small
rivers
on
the
coast
between
cape
sagres
and
cape
tagrin
such
as
tofali
dania
buria
berrea
tanna
pogone
cagrance
dos
casas
but
our
modern
charts
have
none
named
as
in
the
text
on
this
part
of
the
e
this
is
now
called
cape
tagrin
and
forms
the
northern
point
at
the
entrance
of
the
sierra
leone
river
otherwise

or
tagrin
river
the
southern
point
is
named
cape
sierra
leone
and
in
some
maps
is
likewise
named
liedo
very
improperly
it
is
necessary
to
distinguish
carefully
between
the
of
sierra
leone
and
the
mountainous
ridge
of
the
same
name
which
appears
to
extend
a
considerable
way
along
the
coast
to
the
near
fifty
miles
to
the
river
kates
or
sa
ma
della

but
from
the
baldness
of
the
narrative
there
is
great
difficulty
in
tracing
out
this

these
are
now
called
bananas
islands
in

perhaps
the
e
probably
that
now
called

this
account
seems
again
to
refer
to
the

camaranca

tassa
point
otherwise
called
cape
st

yet
this
cape
is
brought
in
immediately
afterwards
indeed
this

is
inextricably
confused
probably
incorrect
or
e
the

with
sherbro
strand
and
shoals
a
very
prominent
feature
of
this
part
of
the
african
coast
is
here
entirely
overlooked
unless
we
suppose
de
cintra
to
have
gone
on
the
outside
of
that
island
considering
the
sound
as
a
river
and
naming
the
point
of
sherbro
island
cape
st
e
we
have
already
seen
that
don
henry
died
in
this
year
which
must
therefore
be
here
an
error
of
the
press
either
in
the
original
publication
by
cada

or
in
some
of
the

of

the
illustrious
father
of

discovery
the
progress
of
the
portuguese
along
the
coast
of
africa
received
a
considerable
check
as
the
military
ardour
of
alphonzo
the
fifth
was
principally
directed
to
the
support
of
his
pretensions
to
the
throne
of
castile
the
circumstances
of
which
are
unconnected
with
the
plan
of
this
work
king
alphonzo
was
not
however
entirely
inattentive
to
the
trade
for
gold
and
slaves
which
his
illustrious
uncle
don
henry
had
commenced
with
that
part
of
africa
which
is
now
called
guinea
the
origin
of
this
name
of
guinea
or
is
unknown
it
is
not
in
use
among
the
natives
and
seems
to
have
been
imposed
by
the
portuguese
from
the
appellation
of
given
to
a
country
on
the
south
side
of
the
senegal
us
first
mentioned
by
leo
and
afterwards
by
marmol
ever
since
the
year
as
already
mentioned
considerable
importations
of
gold
had
been
made
to
portugal
from
the
coast
of
africa
but
little
or
no
progress
had
been
made
in
extending
the
discoveries
farther
south
for
some
time
previous
to
the
decease
of
don
henry
in
king
alphonzo
sailed
with
a
considerable
army
in
a
fleet
of
above
ships
and
carried
the
strong
fort
of
on
the
atlantic
coast
of

a
little
way
to
the
south
of
the
straits
of

of
his
military
exploits
in

from
which
he
acquired
the
appellation
of

assumed

additional
title
of

present
purpose
does
not
call
for
any
recital
in
the
disputes
between
the
crowns
of
portugal
and
castile
were
compromised
by
a
treaty
entered
into
by
alphonzo
king
of
portugal
and
ferdinand
king
of
castile
by
which
the
trade
of
guinea
and
the
navigation
of
its
coast
with
the
proposed
conquest
of
were
guaranteed
to
portugal
and
the
canary
islands
were
annexed
to
the
crown
of
castile
from
the
want
of
any
accurate
history
of
the
progress
of
the
portuguese
discoveries
it
is
utterly
impossible
to
determine
the
dates
or
circumstances
of
many
of
the
progressive
discoveries
along
the
western
coast
of
africa
and
of
its
islands

alphonzo
farmed
the
guinea
trade
for
five
years
to
fernando
gomez
for
the
yearly
rent
of
ducats
or
about
pounds
taking
him
bound
at
the
same
time
to
extend
the
discoveries
for
leagues
to
the
southwards
during
the
period
of
his
exclusive
privilege
in

to
marmol

and
pedro

farther

the
guidance
of

experienced
pilots
martin

this
promontory
which
is
leagues
to
the

gonzales
derived
its
name
from
the
day
of
the
saint
on
which
it
was
first
seen
and
forms
the
northern
boundary
of
the
great
kingdom
of
congo
the
discovery
of
this
cape
is
assigned
by
some
writers
to
sequiera
a
knight
belonging
to
the
royal
household
the
celebrated
portuguese
historian
emanuel
de
faria
in
his
has
recorded
all
the
portuguese
voyages
from
their
first
attempts
under
don
henry
to
their
developement
of
china
and
japan
and
has
even
left
an
account
of
all
the
ships
that
sailed
from
lisbon
for
africa
and
asia
down
to
the
year
but
was
unable
to
ascertain
the
dates
of
many
important
events
neither
he
nor
de
barros
have
been
able
to
remove
the
uncertainty
respecting
the
first
discovery
of
the
island
of
st
thomas
on
the
coast
of
africa
the
south
end
of
which
touches
the
equinoctial
during
the
remainder
of
the
reign
of
alphonzo
the
line
of
coast
from
cape
verga
in
lat
to
cape
st
catherine
in
was
much
frequented
by
the
portuguese
of
this
coast
an
ample
account
has
been
given
by
dapper
and
barbot
chiefly
following
a
tract
published
by
gotard
artus
of
dantzick
which
is
to
be
found
in
de
bry
collection
and
that
of
david
von
nyendael
and
others
this
was
the
work
of
a
dutch
navigator
which
was
first
translated
in
to
german
and
thence
by
artus
into
latin
but
our
peculiar
department
is
confined
to
actual
voyages
and
travels
and
the
progress
of
discovery
and
it
would
both
much
exceed
our
proper
limits
and
would
be
an
entire
deviation
from
our
plan
of
arrangement
to
admit
lengthened
geographical
and
topographical
disquisitions
which
so
far
as
they
are
at
all
admissible
must
be
reserved
for
the
more
particular
voyages
and
travels
after
those
of
general
discovery
have
been
discussed
there
are
four
principal
islands
in
the
gulf
of
guinea
or
bight
of
biafra
as
it
is
usually
called
by
english
navigators
ferdinand
poo
princes
isle
st
thomas
and
annobon
the
discovery
of
which
have
been
related
as
follows
by
barbot
and
his
account
seems
the
most
probable
fernando
lopez
discovered
the
first
of
these
in
in
lat
giving
it
the
name
of
or
the
beautiful
island
which
was
afterwards
changed
to
that
of
which
it
still
retains
in
an
account
of
the
kingdom
of
congo
in
churchill
collection
viii
more
properly
named

oxford
collection
or
that
of
osborne
this
island
and
a
river
on
the
coast
of
the
continent
of
africa
directly
east
now
called
cameroon
river
are
said
to
have
taken
their
names
of
fernando
poo
from
their
first
discoverer
some
writers
assign
the
discovery
of
these
four
islands
and
that
of
st
matthew
to
fernando
gomez
who
formed
the
guinea
trade
perhaps
they
were
discovered
under
his
auspices
by
the
navigators
whom
he
employed
this
island
is
composed
of
very
high
land
easily
seen
at
a
great
distance
and
the
portuguese
had
formerly
sugar
plantations
upon
it
the
do
or
princes
island
in
lat
was
either
discovered
by
fernando
lopez
or
by
santaren
and
escobar
about
the
same
period
and
probably
received
its
name
in
honour
of
the
illustrious
prince
don
henry
this
island
is
described
as
consisting
of
high
table
mountains
pyramidal
at
their
bases
and
visible
at
the
distance
of
twenty
leagues
being
about
nine
leagues
long
by
five
leagues
broad
it
is
said
to
abound
in
oranges
lemons
bananas
rice
many
species
of
sallad
herbs
and
to
be
susceptible
of
producing
the
european
grains
the
mandioca
or
root
of
the
cassada
plant
is
generally
used
for
bread
of
which
the
juice
while
raw
is
said
to
be
a
virulent
poison
while
its
meal
or
rasped
root
after
the
malignant
juice
is
carefully
pressed
out
is
used
for
bread
the
inhabitants
also
have
sheep
hogs
goats
and
an
immense
number
of
poultry
but
these
have
probably
been
introduced
by
the
portuguese
the
de
san
or
island
of
st
thomas
which
is
said
to
have
received
its
name
from
the
saint
to
whom
the
chapel
of
the
great
monastery
of
is
dedicated
and
to
which
all
the
african
discoveries
are
subjected
in
spirituals
has
its
southern
extremity
almost
directly
under
the
equinoctial
and
is
a
very
high
land
of
an
oval
shape
about
fifteen
leagues
in
breadth
by
twelve
leagues
long
the
most
southerly
of
these
islands
in
lat
now
called
annobon
was
originally
named
ilha
bueno
or
island
of
the
happy
year
having
been
discovered
by
pedro
on
the
first
day
of
the
year
at
a
distance
this
island
has
the
appearance
of
a
single
high
mountain
and
is
almost
always
topt
with
mist
it
extends
about
five
leagues
from
north
to
south
or
rather
from
to
and
is
about
four
leagues
broad
being
environed
by
several
rocks
and
shoals
it
has
several
fertile
vallies
which
produce
maize
rice
millet
potatoes
yams
bananas
citrons
oranges
lemons
figs
and
tamarinds
and
a
sort
of
small
nuts
called
by
the
french
de
or
physic
nuts
it
also
furnishes
oxen
hogs
and
sheep
with
abundance
of
fish
and
poultry
and
its
cotton
is
accounted
excellent
including
the
voyages
of
cada
mosto
and
pedro
de
cintra
which
have
been
already
detailed
as
possibly
within
the
period
which
elapsed
between
the
death
of
don
henry
in
and
king
alphonzo
which
latter
event
took
place
on
the
august
and
the
detached
fragments
of
discovery
related
in
the
present
section
we
have
been
only
able
to
trace
a
faint
outline
of
the
uncertain
progress
of
portuguese
discovery
during
that
period
of
eighteen
years
extending
as
already
mentioned
to
cape
st
catherine
and
the
island
of
annobon
a
considerable
advance
therefore
had
been
made
since
the
lamented
death
of
the
illustrious
don
henry
which
comprehended
the
whole
coast
of
guinea
with
its
two
gulfs
usually
named
the
of
benin
and
biafra
with
the
adjacent
islands
and
extending
to
the
northern
frontier
of
the
kingdom
of
congo
if
the
following
assertion
of
de
barros
could
be
relied
on
we
might
conclude
that
some
nameless
portuguese
navigators
had
crossed
the
line
even
before
the
death
of
don
henry
but
the
high
probability
is
that
the
naval
pupils
of
that
illustrious
prince
continued
to
use
his
impress
upon
their
discoveries
long
after
his
decease
and
that
the
limits
of
discovery
in
his
time
was
confined
to
cape
vergas
some
castilians
sailing
under
the
command
of
garcia
de
loaysa
a
knight
of
malta
landed
in
on
the
island
of
st
matthew
in
two
degrees
of
southern
latitude
they
here
observed
that
it
had
been
formerly
visited
by
the
portuguese
as
they
found
an
inscription
on
the
bark
of
a
tree
implying
that
they
had
been
there
years
before
it
also
bore
the
usual
motto
of
that
prince
de
bien
in
the
paucity
of
authentic
information
respecting
these
discoveries
it
seems
proper
to
insert
the
following
abstract
of
the
journal
of
a
portuguese
pilot
to
the
island
of
st
thomas
as
inserted
by
ramusio
previous
to
the
voyage
of
vasco
de
gama
but
of
uncertain
date
although
in
the
opinion
of
the
ingenious
author
of
the
progress
of
maritime
discover
this
voyage
seems
to
have
been
performed
between
the
years
and
in
this
state
of
uncertainty
it
is
therefore
made
a
section

itself
detached

measure
from

position

that

must
refer
to

these
dates
would
throw
back
the
discovery
of
this
island
and
the
passage
of

line
by
the
mariners
of

ii
voyage
of
a
portuguese
pilot
from
lisbon
to
the
island
of
st
thomas
before
i
left
venice
i
was
requested
by
letter
from
signior
hieronimo
fracastro
of
verona
that
on
my
arrival
at
conde
i
would
send
him
an
account
of
my
voyage
to
san
thome
to
which
island
our
ships
often
sail
for
cargoes
of
sugar
the
passage
of
the
equinoctial
line
under
which
that
island
is
situated
appeared
to
that
gentleman
so
extraordinary
a
circumstance
as
to
merit
the
attention
of
men
of
science
and
you
likewise
made
me
a
similar
request
i
began
therefore
immediately
after
my
return
to
draw
up
an
account
of
my
voyage
from
those
notes
which
we
pilots
usual
keep
of
all
occurrences
and
i
compared
it
in
my
progress
with
the
journals
of
some
friends
who
had
formerly
made
the
same
voyage
when
i
afterwards
attentively
perused
my
manuscript
it
did
not
appear
to
me
worthy
of
being
communicated
to
a
gentleman
of
such
scientific
character
as
signor
hieronimo
whose
talents
i
had
duly
appreciated
by
the
perusal
of
his
publications
which
i
received
from
you
before
my
departure
from
venice
i
therefore
laid
my
manuscript
aside
not
wishing
that
any
one
might
peruse
it
but
as
you
have
again
urged
the
performance
of
my
promise
i
now
anxiously
obey
a
request
which
as
coming
from
you
i
must
always
consider
a
command
apprehensive
likewise
of
appearing
forgetful
of
your
polite
attentions
i
prefer
the
danger
of
exposing
my
ignorance
to
the
possibility
of
being
charged
with
ingratitude
or
want
of
attention
being
a
sailor
and
unused
to
composition
i
pretend
to
little
more
than
copying
the
remarks
of
those
who
have
sailed
from
our
continent
to
without
attempting
to
reduce
my
narrative
into
lucid
order
or
to
embellish
it
with
fine
writing
you
will
therefore
have
the
goodness
to
destroy
this
account
after
its
perusal
that
the
errors
i
have
committed
by
compliance
with
your
commands
may
not
draw
upon
me
the
imputation
of
presumption
the
portuguese
ships
which
sail
to
the
island
of
st
thomas
from
lisbon
for
cargoes
of
sugar
usually
put
to
sea
in
february
though
some
vessels
make
this
voyage
at
every
period
of
the
year
their
course
is
until
they
reach
the
canary
islands
after
which
they
steer
for
the
island
of
palmas
which
is
opposite
to
cape
bojador
on
the
coast
of
africa
and
is
about
ninety
leagues
from
the
kingdom
of
castile
this
island
has
plenty
of
provisions
and
abounds
in
wine
and
sugar
the
west
wind
prevails
most
and
a
great
sea
rages
continually
on
its
coast
particularly
in
the
month
of
december
if
the
ships
which
are
bound
for
the
island
of
st
thomas
find
it
necessary
to
obtain
a
quantity
of
salt
after
having
taken
on
board
a
sufficient
supply
at
the
island
of
they
steer
for
the
coast
of
africa
at
the
rio
del
oro
and
if
they
have
calm
weather
and
a
smooth
sea
they
catch
as
many
fish
in
four
hours
with
hooks
and
lines
as
may
suffice
for
all
their
wants
during
the
remainder
of
the
voyage
but
if
the
weather
is
unfavourable
for
fishing
at
the
rio
del
oro
they
proceed
along
the
coast
to
cape
branco
and
thence
along
the
coast
to
the
island
of
arguin
the
principal
sorts
of
fish
on
this
coast
are
called
by
the
venetians
likewise
and
which
latter
are
only
a
larger
and
species
of
as
soon
as
taken
the
fish
are
opened
and
salted
and
serve
as
an

this

is
very
mountainous
and
is
very
barren
in
many
parts
which
are
entirely
destitute
of

but
its
vallies
are
fertile
and
well
cultivated
in

when

they
also
sow
much
rice

cotton
the

is
manufactured
into

which
are
exported
to

to
give
a

it
is
proper
to
inform
you
that
the
western
coast
of
africa
is
divided
into
several
countries
and
provinces
as
guinea
the
kingdom
of
benin
and
the
kingdom
of
manicongo
over
all
this
extent
of
coast
there
are
many
negro
kings
or
chiefs
whose
subjects
are
mahometans
and
idolaters
and
who
are
continually
at
war
with
each
other
these
kings
are
much
respected
by
their
subjects
almost
to
adoration
as
they
are
believed
to
have
originally
descended
from
heaven
when
the
king
of
benin
dies
his
subjects
assemble
in
an
extensive
plain
in
the
centre
of
which
a
vast
pit
or
sepulchre
is
dug
into
which
the
body
is
lowered
and
all
the
friends
and
servants
of
the
deceased
are
sacrificed
and
thrown
into
the
same
grave
thus
voluntarily
throwing
away
their
own
lives
in
honour
of
the
dead
on
this
coast
there
grows
a
species
of
extremely
pungent
like
pepper
and
resembling
the
italian
grain
called
it
produces
likewise
a
species
of
pepper
of
great
strength
not
inferior
to
any
of
that
which
the
portuguese
bring
from
calicut
under
the
name
of
del
or
dalla
and
which
african
pepper
resembles
but
so
powerful
that
an
ounce
will
go
farther
than
a
pound
of
the
common
sort
but
its
exportation
is
prohibited
lest
it
should
injure
the
sale
of
that
which
is
brought
from
calicut
there
is
also
established
on
this
coast
a
manufacture
of
an
excellent
kind
of
soap
from
and
ashes
which
is
carried
on
for
the
king
account
all
the
trade
of
this
coast
to
the
kingdom
of
exclusively
is
farmed
out
every
four
or
five
years
to
the
highest
bidder
great
negro
caravans
bring
gold
and
slaves
to
the
stations
on
the
coast
the
slaves
are
either
prisoners
taken
in
war
or
children
whom
their
parents
have
parted
with
in
the
hope
of
their
being
carried
to
a
more
fertile
country
for
above
ninety
years
after
the
first
discovery
of
this
coast
the
portuguese
merchants
were
accustomed
to
enter
the
large
rivers
by
which
the
country
is
everywhere
intersected
trading
independently
with
the
numerous
tribes
inhabiting
their
banks
but
now
the
whole
of
this
commerce
is
in
the
hands
of
stationary
licensed
factors
to
whom
it
is
farmed
on
quitting
st
jago
we
steer
southerly
for
the
rio
grande
which
is
on
the
north
of
ethiopia
beyond
which
we
come
to
the
high
mountain
of
sierra
liona
the
summit
of
which
is
continually
enveloped
in
mist
out
of
which
thunder
and
lightning
almost
perpetually
flashes
and
is
heard
at
sea
from
the
distance
of
forty
or
fifty
miles
though
the
sun
is
quite
vertical
in
passing
over
this
mountain
and
extremely
hot
yet
the
thick
fog
is
never
dissipated
in
our
voyage
we
never
lose
sight
of
land
yet
keep
always
at
a
considerable
distance
carefully
observing
the
declination
of
the
sun
and
keeping
a
southerly
course
till
we
arrive
in
degrees
on
the
when
we
suddenly
change
our
course
to
the
keeping
the
ethiopian
coast
always
on
our
left
hand
in
our
way
to
the
island
of
st
thomas
on
this
coast
between
the
tropic
and
the
equinoctial
we
never
meet
with
any
hard
gales
as
storms
are
very
rarely
found
within
the
tropics
on
nearing
the
land
the
soundings
in
many
parts
of
the
coast
do
not
exceed
fifty
but
farther
out
the
depth
rapidly
increases
and
the
sea
usually
runs
high
at
a
distance
from
the
land
when
we
arrived
at
rio
del
oro
as
mentioned
before
we
observed
four
stars
in
the
form
of
a
cross
of
an
extraordinary
size
and
splendour
elevated
thirty
degrees
above
the
antarctic
pole
and
forming
the
constellation
called
while
under
the
tropic
of
cancer
we
saw
this
constellation
very
low
and
on
directing
our
to
the
lowermost
of
these
stars
we
found
it
to
be
directly
south
and
concluded
that
it
must
be
in
the
centre
of
the
antarctic
polar
circle
we
observed
the
same
constellation
very
high
when
we
were
at
the
island
of
st
thomas
and
remarked
that
the
moon
after
rain
produces
a
rainbow
similar
to
that
occasioned
by
the
sun
during
the
day
except
that
the
colours
were
dim
and
on
leaving
the
straits
of
gibraltar
i
did
not
observe
any
sensible
change
on
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
sea
but
when
we
approached
rio
grande
which
is
eleven
degrees
to
the
north
of
the
equinoctial
we
observed
a
considerable
tide
at
the
mouth
of
that
river
and
the
rise
in
some
places
was
much
the
same
as
on
the
coast
of
portugal
whereas
at
the
isle
of
st
thomas
it
was
nearly
the
same
as
at
venice
the
island
of
st
thomas
was
discovered
above
eighty
years
ago
by
some
captains
in
the
royal
navy
of
portugal
and
was
altogether
unknown
to
the
ancients
its
horizon
or
parallel
passes
at
an
equal
distance
between
the
arctic
and
antarctic
poles
and
its
days
and
nights
are
always
equal
the
arctic
polar
star
is
there
invisible
but
the
are
seen
in
some
measure
to
revolve
and
the
constellation
which
is
known
by
the
name
of
is
seen
in
the
heavens
at
a
high
altitude
to
the
eastwards
of
st
thomas
and
at
the
distance
of
miles
the
small
island
called
is
situated
this
latter
island
is
inhabited
and
cultivated
the
produce
of
its
sugar
canes
belonging
to
the
revenue
of
the
kings
eldest
son
from
which
circumstance
the
island
derives
its
name
to
the
or
and
by
and
in
the
latitude
of
almost
is
the
uninhabited
island
of
annobon
on
which
numbers
of
crocodiles
and
venomous
serpents
are
found
its
rocky
shores
abound
in
fish
and
are
much
resorted
to
by
the
inhabitants
of
st
thomas
on
that
account
when
first
discovered
the
island
of
st
thomas
was
an
entire
forest
containing
a
variety
of
trees
which
though
barren
were
extremely
verdant
these
trees
were
all
remarkably
tall
and
straight
their
branches
all
drawn
close
to
the
stems
and
not
spreading
out
as
with
us
after
clearing
away
a
great
part
of
the
forest
the
inhabitants
built
a
principal
town
called
which
has
an
excellent
harbour
the
principal
dependence
of
the
settlers
in
this
island
is
upon
their
sugars
which
they
exchange
yearly
with
the
merchants
who
trade
thither
for
flour
in
barrels
wines
oil
cheese
leather
swords
glass
beads
and
which
are
a
small
kind
of
shells
called
by
the
italians
and
which
pass
in
ethiopia
as
money
the
europeans
who
reside
on
this
island
depend
much
for
provisions
on
the
ships
as
they
can
not
subsist
on
the
fare
used
by
the
negroes
the
slaves
employed
in
their
sugar
plantations
are
procured
from
guinea
benin
and
congo
and
some
rich
planters
have
from
to
negroes
these
work
five
days
in
every
week
for
their
masters
and
are
allowed
the
saturdays
to
themselves
when
they
cultivate
various
articles
of
provision
as
the
a
species
of
bean
formerly
mentioned
a
root
called
and
many
species
of
culinary
vegetables
the
seeds
of
which
must
be
imported
from
europe
as
they
do
not
come
to
perfection
in
this
climate
illustration

western

the
soil
of
st
thomas
consists
of
a
red
and
yellow
marl
or
clay
of
great
fertility
which
is
kept
soft
and
mellow
by
the
heavy
dews
which
fall
nightly
contributing
greatly
to
vegetation
and
preventing
it
from
being
dried
up
by
the
great
heats
and
so
great
is
the
luxuriant
fertility
of
the
soil
that
trees
immediately
spring
up
on
any
spots
left
uncultivated
and
will
grow
as
high
in
a
few
days
as
would
require
as
many
months
with
us
these
sprouts
are
cut
down
and
burnt
by
the
slaves
and
their
ashes
are
used
as
manure
for
the
sugarcanes
if
planted
in
january
the
canes
are
ready
to
be
cut
in
june
and
those
which
are
planted
in
february
become
ripe
in
july
and
in
this
manner
they
keep
up
a
succession
throughout
the
whole
year
in
march
and
september
when
the
sun
is
vertical
the
great
rains
set
in
accompanied
with
cloudy
and
thick
weather
which
is
of
great
service
to
the
sugar
plantations
this
island
produces
yearly
above
arobas
of
sugar
each
containing
of
our
pounds
of
which
the
king
receives
the
tenth
part
which
usually
produces
from
to
arobas
though
many
of
the
planters
do
not
pay
this
tythe
fully
there
are
about
sixty
driven
by
water
for
bruising
the
canes
and
pressing
out
the
juice
which
is
boiled
in
vast
chaldrons
after
which
it
is
poured
into
pans
in
the
shape
of
holding
from
fifteen
to
twenty
pounds
each
in
which
it
is
purified
by
means
of
ashes
in
some
parts
of
the
island
where
they
have
not
streams
of
water
the
canes
are
crushed
by
machines
worked
by
the
negroes
and
in
others
by
horses
the
bruised
canes
are
given
to
the
hogs
which
hardly
get
any
other
food
yet
fatten
wonderfully
and
their
flesh
is
so
delicate
and
wholesome
as
to
be
preferred
to
that
of
poultry
many
sugar
refiners
have
been
brought
here
from
madeira
on
purpose
to
endeavour
to
manufacture
the
sugars
of
st
thomas
more
white
and
harder
than
its
usual
produce
but
in
vain
this
is
alleged
to
proceed
from
the
extreme
richness
of
the
soil
injuring
the
quality
of
the
sugar
just
as
with
us
wines
produced
in
soils
of
too
great
fertility
are
apt
to
have
a
peculiar
flavour
another
cause
of
this
is
supposed
to
proceed
from
the
climate
of
the
island
being
too
hot
and
too
moist
except
in
the
month
of
june
july
and
august
at
which
season
a
fresh
dry
wind
blows
from
ethiopia
to
this
island
and
they
then
make
their
best
sugars
the
planters
are
obliged
to
ship
off
their
sugars
as
soon
as
they
can
procure
shipping
because
they
would
become
liquid
if
attempted
to
be
kept
for
a
length
of
time
at
present
not
above

any
person
who
comes
to
this
island
for
the
purpose
of
settling
whether
from
spain
or
portugal
or
any
other
country
may
procure
from
the
royal
intendant
as
much
land
as
he
is
able
to
cultivate
and
at
a
moderate
price
the
esculent
root
which
is
known
in
the
spanish
islands
by
the
name
of
is
here
named
ingame
by
the
negroes
and
is
their
principal
food
either
boiled
or
roasted
under
the
ashes
there
are
different
kinds
of
this
root
produced
on
the
island
but
that
which
is
known
by
the
name
of
is
preferred
by
the
merchant
vessels
all
of
which
purchase
considerable
quantities
as
a
for
their
homeward
voyage

the
negroes
cultivate
them
largely

the
express
purpose

this
island
is
distinguished
by
a
high
mountain
in
the
middle
thickly
covered
by
tall
straight
and
verdant
trees
and
its
summit
is
continually
enveloped
in
clouds
whence
water
is
diffused
in
numerous
streams
all
over
the
island
a
large
shallow
stream
flows
through
the
city
of
pouoasan
supplying
it
with
abundance
of
excellent
water
which
the
inhabitants
reckon
of
a
medicinal
quality
and
allege
that
st
thomas
would
not
be
habitable
if
it
were
not
for
this
river
and
its
other
numerous
springs
and
rivulets
the
native
trees
are
chiefly
barren
and
though
some
olives
peaches
and
almonds
were
planted
by
the
early
settlers
which
soon
grew
with
great
luxuriance
they
never
bore
any
fruit
and
this
has
been
the
case
with
all
stone
fruits
that
have
been
tried
but
the
palm
brought
hither
from
ethiopia
has
thriven
satisfactorily
repeated
attempts
have
been
made
to
cultivate
wheat
but
always
unsuccessfully
though
tried
at
different
seasons
of
the
year
as
the
ear
would
never
fill
but
always
ran
up
to
straw
and
chaff
only
in
march
and
september
the
sky
is
always
overcast
with
clouds
and
mists
and
continual
rains
prevail
which
season
is
considered
by
the
inhabitants
as
their
winter
in
may
june
july
and
august
which
they
call
di
or
windy
months
the
prevalent
winds
are
from
the
south
southeast
and
southwest
but
the
island
is
sheltered
by
the
continent
from
the
north
northeast
and
northwest
winds
the
summer
months
are
december
january
and
february
when
the
heat
is
excessive
and
the
atmosphere
being
continually
loaded
with
vapour
occasions
the
air
to
feel
like
the
steam
of

water
the
shores
of
this
island
abound
in
many
kinds
of
fish
and
during
the
months

the
inhabitants
catch

the

that

iii
of
portuguese
discoveries
from
cape
st
catherine
to
the
kingdom
of
we
are
still
obliged
to
continue
the
account
of
the
portuguese
discoveries
historically
from
the
want
of
any
regular
journals
of
their
early
voyages
along
the
african
coast
in
the
original
efforts
of
the
illustrious
don
henry
although
the
progress
was
extremely
slow
we
have
much
to
admire
in
the
character
of
that
prince
who
possessed
genius
to
stretch
beyond
the
trammels
of
custom
and
authority
boldly
thinking
for
himself
pointing
out
the
way
of
extending
the
knowledge
of
our
globe
by
maritime
discoveries
and
persevering
nobly
in
his
renewed
efforts
in
spite
of
the
timid
ignorance
of
his
unexperienced
pilots
and
mariners
but
it
is
not
easy
to
explain
the
continuance
of
that
slow
progress
which
was
even
retarded
during
the
years
which
elapsed
between
the
demise
of
that
prince
of
mariners
in
and
that
of
alphonso
in
when
the
increased
experience
of
the
portuguese
in
their
frequent
voyages
to
the
new
discovered
atlantic
islands
and
african
coast
ought
to
have
inspired
them
with
fresh
vigour
and
extended
views
of
discovery
and
commerce
the
military
character
of
alphonso
may
however
explain
this
in
a
great
degree
as
all
his
energies
were
directed
towards
the
extension
of
dominion
in
the
moorish
kingdom
of
fez
and
the
business
of
discovery
was
devolved
as
a
burdensome
and
unprofitable
task
on
the
farmers
of
the
trade
to
the
coast
of
africa
which
appears
to
have
become
extensive
and
lucrative
after
the
discovery
of
guinea
and
its
islands
and
the
establishment
of
the
sugar
colonies
in
these
islands
we
learn
likewise
from
the
preceding
voyage
of
the
portuguese
pilot
to
the
island
of
st
thomas
that
the
mariners
still
confined
themselves
almost
entirely
to
creeping
along
the
coast
from
cape
to
cape
and
from
island
to
island
not
daring
to
trust
themselves
to
the
trackless
ocean
under
the
now
sure
guidance
of
the
heavenly
luminaries
but
which
they
then
did
not
sufficiently
understand
nor
did
they
possess
sufficient
instruments
for
directing
their
course
in
the
ocean
it
would
appear
that
they
had
then
no
other
method
of
computing
the
longitude
but
by
means
of
the
log
or
dead
reckoning
which
is
liable
to
perpetual
uncertainty
from
currents
and
and
which
a
storm
even
of
short
continuance
must
have
thrown
into
total
confusion
their
instruments
and
methods
for
determining
even
the
latitudes
appear
to
have
then
been
imperfect
and
little
understood
in
the
sequel
of
this
deduction
we
shall
find
the
first
portuguese
squadron
which
sailed
for
india
conducted
across
the
indian
ocean
by
a
moorish
pilot
on
the
accession
of
john
ii
to
the
throne
of
portugal
in
the
discoveries
along
the
coast
of
africa
were
resumed
with
a
new
spirit
while
infante
or
hereditary
prince
his
principal
revenue
was
derived
from
the
profits
of
the
guinea
trade
and
of
the
importation
of
gold
from
the
haven
of
mina
and
among
the
first
measures
of
his
reign
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
improvement
and
extension
of
that
valuable
branch
of
commerce
for
this
purpose
he
gave
orders
to
make
all
necessary
preparations
for
building
a
fortress
and
church
at
the
port
of
mina
all
the
requisite
materials
even
to
stones
and
tiles
were
accordingly
shipped
from
lisbon
in
a
squadron
of
ten
caravels
and
two
transports
with
soldiers
and
labourers
or
workmen
of
various
kinds
this
expedition
was
placed
under
the
command
of

at

village
named
where
they
found
juan
bernardo
who
had
previously
sailed
for
the
coast
in
quest
of

bernardo
was
immediately
sent
by
azumbuja
to
inform
camarança
the
negro
chief
of
the
district
with
the
arrival
of
the
portuguese
armament
and
to
desire
a
conference
with
directions
to
endeavour
to
impress
that
chief
with
a
high
sense
of
the
rank
and
character
of
the
portuguese
officers
and
of
the
irresistible
power
of
the
armament
now
upon
his
coast
early
next
morning
azambuja
landed
with
all
his
followers
who
were
secretly
armed
in
case
of
meeting
with
any
hostilities
from
the
natives
and
moved
forwards
in
great
form
to
a
large
tree
not
far
from
the
negro
village
of
aldea
on
a
spot
which
had
been
chosen
as
a
convenient
situation
for
the
intended
fortress
a
flag
bearing
the
royal
arms
of
portugal
was
immediately
displayed
upon
the
tree
and
an
altar
was
placed
under
the
shade
of
its
boughs
at
which
the
whole
company
united
in
assisting
at
the
first
mass
that
was
celebrated
in
guinea
offering
up
their
solemn
prayers
to
god
for
the
speedy
conversion
of
the
idolatrous
natives
and
for
the
perpetual
continuance
and
prosperity
of
the
church
which
was
to
be
erected
on
this
spot
the
day
on
which
this
impressive
ceremony
was
performed
being
dedicated
to
st
sebastian
that
name
was
given
to
the
valley
on
which
the
tree
stood
under
which
they
were
now
assembled
soon
after
the
completion
of
this
religious
ceremony
camarança
approached
with
a
numerous
train
azambuja
sumptuously
dressed
and
ornamented
by
a
rich
golden
collar
prepared
to
receive
the
negro
chief
seated
on
an
elevated
chair
having
all
his
retinue
arranged
before
him
so
as
to
form
an
avenue
the
negroes
were
armed
with
spears
shields
bows
and
arrows
and
wore
a
kind
of
helmets
made
of
skins
thickly
studded
with
fish
teeth
giving
them
a
very
martial
appearance
the
subordinate
chiefs
were
distinguished
by
chains
of
gold
hanging
from
their
necks
and
had
various
golden
ornaments
on
their
heads
and
even
on
their
beards
after
the
exchange
of
presents
and
other
tokens
of
mutual
respect
and
confidence
azambuja
made
a
speech
to
camarança
through
the
mediation
of
an
interpreter
in
which
he
explained
the
purpose
of
his
embassy
and
expedition
and
used
every
argument
he
could
think
of
to
conciliate
the
friendship
of
the
negro
chief
to
make
him
fully
sensible
of
the
power
of
the
king
of
portugal
and
to
reconcile
him
to
the
intended
permanent
establishment
upon
the
toast
camarança
listened
to
the
harangue
and
the
explanation
of
it
by
the
interpreter
in
respectful
silence
keeping
his
eyes
steadily
fixed
on
the
countenance
of
azambuja
after
which
casting
his
eyes
for
some
time
on
the
ground
as
if
profoundly
meditating
on
what
he
had
heard
he
is
said
to
have
made
the
following
guarded
and
judicious
answer
i
am
fully
sensible
of
the
high
honour
done
me
on
this
occasion
by
your
sovereign
i
have
always
endeavoured
to
deserve
his
friendship
by
dealing
strictly
with
his
subjects
and
by
constantly
exerting
myself
to
procure
immediate
ladings
for
their
ships
hitherto
the
portuguese
who
have
visited
my
country
were
meanly
dressed
and
easily
satisfied
with
the
commodities
we
had
to
give
them
and
so
far
from
desiring
to
remain
in
the
country
were
always
anxious
to
complete
their
cargoes
and
to
return
whence
they
came
this
day
i
observe
a
wonderful
difference
a
great
number
of
persons
richly
dressed
are
eager
for
permission
to
build
themselves
houses
and
to
remain
among
us
but
assuredly
persons
of
such
rank
under
the
guidance
of
a
commander
who
claims
his
descent
from
the
god
who
created
the
day
and
the
night
would
never
be
able
to
endure
the
hardships
of
our
climate
and
could
not
procure
in
this
country
those
luxuries
they
have
been
accustomed
to
in
their
own
those
passions
which
are
common
to
all
men
will
certainly
produce
disputes
between
us
and
it
were
much
better
that
we
should
continue
on
the
same
footing
as
hitherto
allowing
your
ships
to
come
and
go
as
they
have
always
done
before
in
which
case
the
desire
of
seeing
each
other
occasionally
and
of
mutual
intercourse
in
trade
will
preserve
peace
between
you
and
us
the
sea
and
the
land
which
are
always
neighbours
are
continually
at
variance
contending
for
the
mastery
the
sea
always
violently
endeavouring
to
subdue
the
land
which
with
equal
obstinacy
defends
itself
against
the
encroachments
of
the
sea
the
prudential
jealousy
and
distrust
displayed
on
this
occasion
by
camarança
astonished
and
perplexed
the
portuguese
commander
and
it
required
the
exercise
of
much
address
on
his
part
to
prevail
upon
the
negro
chief
to
allow
the
fulfilment
of
his
orders
and
to
prevent
the
necessity
of
having
recourse
to
violent
measures
when
the
workmen
were
making
preparations
next
day
to
lay
the
foundations
of
the
intended
fortress
on
the
coast
they
observed
a
large
rock
which
lay
very
commodious
for
serving
them
as
a
quarry
and
accordingly
proceeded
to
work
it
for
that
purpose
this
happened
unfortunately
to
be
venerated
by
the
negroes
as
one
of
their
gods
and
they
immediately
flew
to
arms
in
opposition
against
the
sacrilegious
violation
of
the
sanctified
rock
and
many
of
the
workmen
were
wounded
before
the
natives
could
be
pacified
by
numerous
presents
at
length
after
the
constant
labour
of
twenty
days
the
fort
began
to
assume
a
formidable
appearance
and
received
the
name
of
de
san
jorge
da
or
fort
st
george
at
mina
in
a
church
constructed
within
its
walls
a
solemn
mass
was
appointed
to
be
celebrated
annually
in
honour
of
don
henry
duke
of
viseo
of
illustrious
memory
azambuja
continued
governor
of
this
place
during
two
years
and
seven
months
and
was
honoured
on
his
return
to
portugal
with
particular
marks
of
royal
favour
in
king
john
bestowed
on
this
new
establishment
all
the
privileges
end
immunities
of
a
city
impressed
with
the
great
advantages
that
might
be
derived
to
his
kingdom
through
the
prosecution
of
the
maritime
discoveries
in
africa
and
more
especially
by
opening
a
passage
by
sea
to
india
of
which
his
hopes
were
now
sanguine
the
king
of
portugal
who
had
now
added
to
his
titles
that
of
of
made
application
to
the
pope
as
universal
father
and
lord
of
christendom
for
a
perpetual
grant
of
all
the
countries
which
the
portuguese
had
already
discovered
or
should
hereafter
discover
towards
the
east
with
a
strict
prohibition
against
the
interference
of
any
european
state
in
that
immense
field
of
discovery
commerce
and
colonization
the
pope
conceded
this
enormous
grant
probably
without
the
most
distant
idea
of
its
extent
and
importance
not
only
prohibiting
all
christian
powers
from
intruding
within
those
prodigious
yet
indefinite
bounds
which
he
had
bestowed
upon
the
crown
of
portugal
but
declaring
that
all
discoveries
that
were
or
might
be
made
in
contravention
should
belong
to
portugal
hitherto
the
portuguese
navigators
in
the
course
of
their
discoveries
along
the
shores
of
western
africa
had
been
in
use
to
erect
crosses
as
indications
of
their
respective
discoveries
but
the
king
now
ordered
that
they
should
erect
about
six
feet
high
inscribed
with
the
arms
of
portugal
the
name
of
the
reigning
sovereign
that
of
the
navigator
and
the
date
of
the
discovery
in
the
year
diego
cam
or
cano
proceeded
beyond
cape
st
catherine
in
lat
the
last
discovery
of
the
reign
of
king
alphonso
and
reached
the
mouth
of
a
considerable
river
in
lat
called
by
the
natives
now
called
congo
river
or
the
rio
padron
diego
proceeded
some
distance
up
this
river
till
he
met
with
some
of
the
natives
but
was
unable
to
procure
any
satisfactory
intelligence
from
them
as
they
were
not
understood
by
the
negro
interpreters
on
board
his
ship
by
means
of
signs
however
he
understood
that
the
country
was
under
the
dominion
of
a
king
who
resided
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
coast
in
a
town
or
city
called
banza
since
named
san
salvador
by
the
portuguese
on
which
he
sent
a
party
of
his
crew
conducted
by
the
natives
carrying
a
considerable
present
far
the
king
and
meaning
to
wait
their
return
unavoidable
circumstances
however
having
protracted
the
return
of
his
people
far
beyond
the
appointed
time
diego
resolved
to
return
into
portugal
with
an
account
of
his
discovery
and
having
gained
the
confidence
of
the
natives
he
prevailed
on
four
of
them
to
embark
with
him
that
they
might
be
instructed
in
the
portuguese
language
to
serve
as
interpreters
for
future
intercourse
with
this
newly
discovered
region
and
made
the
natives
understand
by
means
of
signs
that
after
the
expiration
of
fifteen
moons
these
persons
should
be
returned
in
safety
these
africans
were
men
of
some
consequence
in
their
own
country
and
were
of
such
quick
apprehensions
that
they
acquired
a
sufficient
knowledge
of
the
portuguese
language
during
the
voyage
back
to
lisbon
as
to
be
able
to
give
a
competent
account
of
their
own
country
and
of
the
kingdoms
or
regions
beyond
it
to
the
southwards
the
king
of
portugal
was
much
gratified
by
this
discovery
and
treated
the
africans
brought
over
by
diego
with
much
munificence
next
year
diego
cam
returned
to
the
river
of
congo
where
he
landed
the
four
natives
who
carried
many
presents
from
king
john
to
their
own
sovereign
and
were
directed
to
express
his
anxious
desire
that
he
and
his
subjects
would
embrace
the
christian
faith
having
landed
the
negroes
and
received
back
his
own
men
whom
he
had
left
on
his
former
voyage
diego
proceeded
to
discover
the
coast
to
the
southwards
of
the
congo
river
leaving
a
respectful
message
for
the
king
of
congo
that
he
must
postpone
the
honour
of
paying
his
respects
to
him
till
his
return
from
the
south
the
farther
progress
of
diego
is
very
indefinitely
related
by
the
portuguese
historians
who
say
that
after
a
run
of
twenty
leagues
he
erected
two
stone
crosses
as
memorials
of
his
progress
one
at
a
cape
called
st
augustine

diego
measured
back
his
way
to
the
congo
river
where
he
was
received
in
a
most
satisfactory
manner
by
the
sovereign
of
that
country
the
reports
of
his
subjects
who
had
been
in
portugal
and
the
liberal
presents
which
they
had
brought
to
him
from
king
john
had
made
a
deep
impression
on
the
mind
of
this
african
monarch
he
made
many
inquiries
respecting
the
christian
religion
and
being
highly
gratified
by
its
sublime
and
consolatory
doctrines
perhaps
influenced
by
the
reports
his
subjects
had
brought
him
of
its
magnificent
ceremonies
he
appointed
one
of
his
principal
noblemen
named
or
to
accompany
diego
cam
as
his
ambassador
to
king
john
anxiously
requesting
the
king
of
portugal
to
allow
this
nobleman
and
his
attendants
to
be
baptized
and
that
he
would
be
pleased
to
send
some
ministers
of
his
holy
religion
to
convert
him
and
his
subjects
from
their
idolatrous
errors
diego
cam
arrived
safely
in
portugal
with
caçuta
who
was
soon
afterwards
baptized
by
the
name
of
the
king
and
queen
of
portugal
doing
him
the
honour
of
attending
on
him
as
sponsors
at
the
holy
font
and
the
splendid
ceremonial
was
closed
by
the
baptism
of
his
sable
attendants
some
time
previous
to
this
event
alphonso
de
aviero
carried
an
ambassador
from
the
king
of
benin
to
the
king
of
portugal
requesting
that
some
missionaries
might
be
sent
for
the
conversion
of
his
subjects
and
although
the
artful
conduct
of
that
african
prince
threw
many
difficulties
in
the
way
of
this
mission
many
of
the
negroes
of
that
country
were
converted
from
the
ambassador
of
benin
the
king
of
portugal
received
information
of
a
powerful
monarch
named
whose
territories
lay
at
the
distance
of
leagues
beyond
the
kingdom
of
benin
and
who
possessed
a
supremacy
over
all
the
adjacent
states
assuming
cape
lopo
gonçalves
in
lat
as
the
southern
boundary
of
the
kingdom
of
benin
portuguese
leagues
would
bring
us
to
the
kingdom
of
benguela
or
that
of
jaa
caconda
about
lat
or
yet
some
persons
have
strangely
supposed
that
this
king
or
was
a
corruption
of
or
the
title
given
by
the
christians
of
the
east
to
the
king
of
abyssinia
but
it
is
very
difficult
to
account
for
this
knowledge
of
abyssinia
in
the
kingdom
of
benin
not
only
on
account
of
the
distance
but
likewise
because
several
of
the
most
savage
nations
in
the
world
the
and
occupy
the
intervening
space
the
court
of
abyssinia
did
indeed
then
reside
in
the
extremity
of
the
kingdom
and
by
its
power
and
influence
might
have
pushed
its
dominion
through
these
barbarians
to
the
neighbourhood
of
benin
on
the
western
ocean
but
all
this
i
must
confess
to
be
a
mere
conjecture
of
mine
of
which
in
the
country
itself
i
never
found
the
smallest
confirmation
to
these
observations
of
the
celebrated
abyssinian
traveller
it
may
be
added
that
the
distance
from
benin
to
shoa
exceeds
six
hundred
portuguese
leagues
while
the
king
of
portugal
continued
to
encourage
his
navigators
to
proceed
to
the
southwards
in
discovering
the
african
coast
he
became
anxious
lest
some
unexpected
rival
might
interpose
to
deprive
him
of
the
expected
fruits
of
these
discoveries
which
had
occupied
the
unremitting
attentions
of
his
predecessors
and
himself
for
so
many
years
learning
that
john
tintam
and
william
fabian
englishmen
were
preparing
at
the
instigation
of
the
duke
of
medina
sidonia
in
to
proceed
on
a
voyage
to
guinea
he
sent
ruy
de
sousa
as
his
ambassador
to
edward
iv
of
england
to
explain
the
title
which
he
held
from
the
pope
as
lord
of
that
country
and
to
induce
him
to
forbid
his
subjects
from
navigating
to
the
coast
of
africa
in
which
negotiation
he
was
completely
successful
he
likewise
used
every
exertion
to
conceal
the
progress
of
his
own
navigators
on
the
western
coast
of
africa
and
to
magnify
the
dangers
of
the
voyage
representing
that
the
coast
was
quite
inhospitable
surrounded
by
most
tremendous
rocks
and
inhabited
by
savage
cannibals
and
that
no
vessels
could
possibly
live
in
those
tempestuous
seas
in
which
every
quarter
of
the
moon
produced
a
furious
storm
except
those
of
a
peculiar
construction
which
had
been
invented
by
the
portuguese
builders
a
portuguese
pilot
who
had
often
made
the
voyage
to
guinea
had
the
temerity
to
assert
that
any
kind
of
ship
could
make
this
redoubted
voyage
as
safely
as
the
royal
caravels
and
was
sent
for
to
court
by
the
king
who
gave
him
a
public
reprimand
for
his
ignorance
and
presumption
some
months
afterwards
the
same
pilot
appeared
again
at
court
and
told
the
king
that
being
of
an
obstinate
disposition
he
had
attempted
the
voyage
to
guinea
in
a
different
kind
of
vessel
from
those
usually
employed
and
found
it
to
be
impossible
the
king
could
not
repress
a
smile
at
this
solemn
nonsense
yet
honoured
the
politic
pilot
with
a
private
audience
and
gave
him
money
to
encourage
him
to
propagate
the
deception
about
this
period
likewise
hearing
that
three
portuguese
seamen
who
were
conversant
in
the
navigation
of
the
coast
of
africa
had
set
out
for
spain
intending
to
offer
their
services
in
that
country
john
immediately
ordered
them
to
be
pursued
as
traitors
two
of
them
were
killed
and
the
third
was
brought
a
prisoner
to
evora
where
he
was
broke
on
the
wheel
hearing
that
the
portuguese
seamen
murmured
at
the
severity
of
this
punishment
the
king
exclaimed
let
every
man
abide
by
his
own
element
i
love
not
travelling
seamen
encouraged
by
the
successful
progress
of
diego
cam
in
and
king
john
became
sanguine
in
his
hopes
of
completing
the
discovery
of
a
maritime
route
to
india
around
the
continent
of
africa
and
determined
upon
using
every
exertion
for
this
purpose
his
first
views
were
to
endeavour
to
procure
some
information
respecting
india
by
means
of
a
journey
overland
and
with
this
object
de
a
franciscan
friar
together
with
a
nameless
lay
companion
were
dispatched
to
make
the
attempt
of
penetrating
into
india
through
palestine
and
egypt
but
being
ignorant
of
the
arabic
language
these
men
were
unable
to
penetrate
beyond
jerusalem
whence
they
returned
into
portugal
though
disappointed
in
this
attempt
by
the
ignorance
or
want
of
enterprise
of
his
agents
his
resolution
was
not
to
be
repressed
by
difficulties
and
he
resolved
upon
employing
fresh
exertions
both
by
sea
and
land
for
the
accomplishment
of
his
enterprise
he
accordingly
fitted
out
a
small
squadron
under
bartholomew
diaz
a
knight
of
the
royal
household
to
attempt
the
passage
by
sea
prog
of
mar
disc
i
note
bruce
abyssinia
ii
section
iv
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
by
bartholomew
diaz
in
for
this
important
enterprise
bartholomew
diaz
was
only
supplied
with
two
small
caravels
of
fifty
ton
each
accompanied
by
a
still
smaller
vessel
or
tender
to
carry
provisions
of
these
vessels
one
was
commanded
by
bartholomew
diaz
as
commodore
the
second
caravel
by
another
cavalier
or
gentleman
of
the
court
and
pedro
diaz
brother
to
the
commander
in
chief
of
the
expedition
had
charge
of
the
tender
the
preparations
being
completed
bartholomew
sailed
in
the
end
of
august
steering
directly
to
the
southwards
we
have
no
relation
of
the
particulars
of
this
voyage
and
only
know
that
the
first
spot
on
which
diaz
placed
a
stone
pillar
in
token
of
discovery
and
possession
was
at
in
about
which
is
said
to
have
been
leagues
farther
to
the
south
than
any
preceding
navigator
according
to
the
portuguese
historians
diaz
sailed
boldly
from
this
place
to
the
southwards
in
the
open
sea
and
never
saw
the
land
again
until
he
was
forty
leagues
to
the
east
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
which
he
had
passed
without
being
in
sight
of
land
the
learned
geographer
major
rennel
informs
us
that
sir
home
popham
and
captain
thompson
while
exploring
the
western
coast
of
africa
in
found
a
marble
cross
on
which
the
arms
of
portugal
were
engraved
in
latitude
near
a
bay
named
angra
pequena
but
as
the
portuguese
long
continued
to
frequent
these
coasts
exclusively
and
considered
them
all
as
belonging
to
their
dominions
under
the
papal
grant
this
latter
cross
on
which
the
inscription
was
not
legible
may
have
been
erected
at
a
considerably
subsequent
period
at
all
events
the
track
of
diaz
was
far
beyond
the
usual
adventure
of
any
former
navigator
as
he
must
have
run
a
course
of
from
seven
to
ten
degrees
of
latitude
and
at
least
between
two
or
three
degrees
of
longitude
in
utterly
unknown
seas
without
sight
of
land
the
first
land
seen
by
diaz
is
said
to
have
been
forty
leagues
to
the
eastward
of
the
cape
where
he
came
in
sight
of
a
bay
on
the
coast
which
he
called
de
los
or
bay
of
herdsmen
from
observing
a
number
of
cows
grazing
on
the
land
the
distance
of
forty
portuguese
leagues
would
lead
us
to
what
is
now
called
struys
bay
immediately
east
of
cabo
das
agullias
which
latter
is
in
lat
and
long
from
greenwich
from
this
place
diaz
continued
his
voyage
eastwards
to
a
small
island
or
rock
in
the
bay
which
is
now
called
zwartkops
or
algoa
in
long
on
which
rocky
islet
he
placed
a
stone
cross
or
pillar
as
a
memorial
of
his
progress
and
named
it
on
that
account
santa
cruz
or
pennol
de
la
in
his
progress
to
this
place
from
the
angra
de
los
vaqueros
he
had
set
some
negroes
on
shore
in
different
places
who
had
been
brought
from
portugal
for
this
purpose
and
who
were
well
clothed
that
they
might
be
respected
by
the
natives
these
negroes
were
likewise
provided
with
small
assortments
of
toys
for
bartering
with
the
natives
and
were
especially
charged
to
make
inquiry
as
to
the
situation
and
distance
of
the
dominions
of
prester
john
of
the
fate
of
these
negroes
we
are
nowhere
informed
but
may
be
well
assured
they
would
receive
no
intelligence
respecting
the
subject
of
their
inquiry
from
the
ignorant
hottentots
and
caffres
of
southern
africa
it
would
appear
that
diaz
was
still
unconscious
that
he
had
reached
and
overpassed
the
extreme
southern
point
of
africa
although
now
nearly
nine
degrees
to
the
east
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
at
least
one
degree
back
towards
the
north
of
his
most
southern
range
but
he
may
have
supposed
himself
in
a
deep
bite
or
bay
of
the
coast
similar
to
the
known
gulf
of
guinea
under
this
impression
that
he
had
not
accomplished
the
grand
object
of
his
enterprize
he
was
anxious
to
continue
his
voyage
still
farther
towards
the
east
but
as
the
provisions
on
board
his
two
caravels
were
nearly
exhausted
and
the
victualling
tender
under
the
command
of
his
brother
was
missing
the
crews
of
the
caravels
became
exceedingly
urgent
to
return
lest
they
might
perish
with
famine
with
some
difficulty
he
prevailed
on
the
people
to
continue
their
course
about
leagues
farther
on
as
he
felt
exceedingly
mortified
at
the
idea
of
returning
to
his
sovereign
without
accomplishing
the
discovery
on
which
he
was
sent
they
accordingly
reached
the
mouth
of
a
river
which
was
discovered
by
juan
infante
and
was
called
from
him
del
now
known
by
the
name
of
river
in
about
lat
long
the
coast
still
trended
towards
the
eastwards
with
a
slight
inclination
towards
the
north
so
that
in
an
eastern
course
of
about
thirteen
degrees
they
had
neared
the
north
about
six
degrees
though
still
unsatisfied
of
having
absolutely
cleared
the
southern
point
of
africa
from
this
river
the
extreme
boundary
of
the
present
voyage
diaz
commenced
his
return
homewards
and
discovered
with
great
joy
and
astonishment
on
their
passage
back
the
long
sought
for
and
tremendous
promontory
which
had
been
the
grand
object
of
the
hopes
and
wishes
of
portuguese
navigation
during
years
ever
since
the
year
when
the
illustrious
don
henry
first
began
to
direct
and
incite
his
countrymen
to
the
prosecution
of
discoveries
along
the
western
shores
of
africa
either
from
the
distance
which
the
caravels
had
been
from
the
land
when
they
first
altered
their
course
to
the
eastwards
or
from
the
cape
having
been
concealed
in
thick
fogs
it
had
escaped
notice
in
the
preceding
part
of
the
voyage
at
this
place
diaz
erected
a
stone
cross
in
memory
of
his
discovery
and
owing
to
heavy
tempests
which
he
experienced
off
the
high
table
land
of
the
cape
he
named
it
dos
or
cape
of
storms
but
the
satisfaction
which
king
john
derived
from
this
memorable
discovery
on
the
return
of
diaz
to
portugal
in
and
the
hope
which
it
imparted
of
having
opened
a
sure
passage
by
sea
from
europe
through
the
atlantic
into
the
indian
ocean
by
which
his
subjects
would
now
reap
the
abundant
harvest
of
all
their
long
and
arduous
labours
induced
that
sovereign
to
change
this
inauspicious
appellation
for
one
of
a
more
happy
omen
and
he
accordingly
ordered
that
it
should
in
future
be
called
de
boa
or
cape
of
good
hope
which
it
has
ever
since
retained
soon
after
the
discovery
of
the
by
which
shorter
name
it
is
now
generally
preeminently
distinguished
diaz
fell
in
with
the
victualler
from
which
he
had
separated
nine
months
before

nine
persons
who
had
composed

crew
of

beholding
his

of
the
circumstances
of
the
voyage
home
we
have
no
account
but
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
that
diaz
and
his
companions
would
be
honourably
received
by
their
sovereign
after
a
voyage

who
made
him
a

the
death
of
that
king
he
was
one
of
the
guard
of
king
john
who
employed
him
on
a
mission
into
spain
on
account
of
his
knowledge
in
the
language
he
was
afterwards
employed
in
barbary
where
he
remained
some
time
and
acquired
the
arabic
language
and
was
employed
to
negotiate
a
peace
with
the
king
of
tremesen
he
was
a
second
time
sent
into
barbary
on
a
mission
to
king
to
procure
restitution
of
the
bones
of
the
infant
don
fernando
in
which
he
was
successful
after
his
return
he
was
joined
in
commission
as
with
alphonso
de
payva
and
these
adventurous
travellers
left
lisbon
in
may
covilham
was
furnished
with
a
very
curious
map
for
these
times
by
the
prince
emanuel
afterwards
king
of
portugal
which
had
been
copied
and
composed
with
great
care
and
secrecy
by
the
licentiate
calzadilla
afterwards
bishop
of
viseo
assisted
by
doctor
rodrigo
and
a
jewish
physician
named
moses
which
map
asserted
the
practicability
of
passing
by
sea
to
india
round
the
southern
extremity
of
africa
on
some
obscure
information
which
had
been
collected
by
those
who
constructed
it
with
a
supply
of
crowns
in
money
and
a
letter
of
credit
or
bills
of
exchange
covilham
and
de
payva
went
first
to
naples
where
their
bills
of
exchange
were
paid
by
the
son
of
de
from
naples
they
went
by
sea
to
the
island
of
rhodes
and
thence
to
alexandria
in
egypt
whence
they
travelled
as
merchants
to
grande
cairo
and
proceeded
with
the
caravan
to
on
the
red
sea
near
the
foot
of
mount
sinai
they
here
received
some
information
respecting
the
trade
which
then
subsisted
between
egypt
and
calicut
and
sailed
from
that
place
to
aden
a
trading
city
of
yemen
on
the
outside
of
the
straits
of
babelmandeb
the
travellers
here
separated
covilham
embarking
in
one
vessel
for
india
while
de
payva
took
his
passage
in
another
vessel
bound
for
suakem
on
the
abyssinian
coast
of
the
red
sea
having
engaged
to
rejoin
each
other
at
cairo
after
having
carried
the
directions
of
their
sovereign
into
effect
the
moorish
ship
from
aden
in
which
covilham
had
embarked
landed
him
at
cananor
on
the
coast
of
malabar
whence
after
some
stay
he
went
to
calicut
and
goa
being
the
first
of
the
portuguese
nation
who
had
navigated
the
indian
ocean
having
seen
pepper
and
ginger
and
heard
of
cloves
and
cinnamon
from
india
he
went
by
sea
to
sofala
on
the
eastern
coast
of
africa
where
he
is
said
to
have
examined
the
gold
mines
and
where
he
procured
some
information
respecting
the
great
island
of
madagascar
called
by
the
moors
the
of
the
with
the
various
and
valuable
information
he
had
now
acquired
relative
to
the
productions
of
india
and
their
marts
and
of
the
eastern
coast
of
africa
he
now
determined
to
return
to
egypt
that
he
might
be
able
to
communicate
his
intelligence
to
portugal
at
cairo
he
was
met
by
messengers
from
king
john
informing
him
that
payva
had
been
murdered
and
directing
him
to
go
to
ormuz
and
the
coast
of
persia
in
order
to
increase
his
stock
of
commercial
knowledge
the
two
messengers
from
the
king
of
portugal
whom
covilham
met
with
at
cairo
were
both
jewish
rabbis
named
abraham
of
beja
and
joseph
of
lamego
the
latter
returned
into
portugal
with
letters
from
covilham
giving
an
account
of
his
observations
and
assuring
his
master
that
the
ships
which
sailed
to
the
coast
of
guinea
might
be
certain
of
finding
a
termination
of
the
african
continent
by
persisting
in
a
southerly
course
and
advising
when
they
should
arrive
in
the
to
inquire
for
sofala
and
the
island
of
the
moon
covilham
and
rabbi
abraham
went
from
cairo
probably
by
sea
to
ormuz
and
the
coast
of
persia
whence
they
returned
in
company
to
aden
from
that
place
abraham
returned
by
the
way
of
cairo
to
portugal
with
the
additional
information
which
had
been
collected
in
their
voyage
to
the
gulf
of
persia
though
some
authors
allege
that
joseph
was
the
companion
of
this
voyage
and
that
he
returned
from
bassora
by
way
of
the
desert
to
aleppo
and
thence
to
portugal
from
aden
covilham
crossed
the
straits
of
babelmandeb
to
the
eastern
coast
of
abyssinia
where
he
found
alexander
the
king
or
negus
at
the
head
of
an
army
levying
tribute
or
contributions
from
his
rebellious
subjects
of
the
southern
provinces
of
his
dominions
alexander
received
covilham
with
kindness
but
more
from
motives
of
curiosity
than
for
any
expectations
of
advantage
that
might
result
from
any
connection
or
communication
with
the
kingdom
of
portugal
covilham
accompanied
the
king
to
shoa
where
the
seat
of
the
abyssinian
government
was
then
established
and
from
a
cruel
policy
which
subsists
still
in
abyssinia
by
which
strangers
are
hardly
ever
permitted
to
quit
the
country
covilham
never
returned
into
europe
though
thus
doomed
to
perpetual
exile
in
a
strange
and
barbarous
land
covilham
was
well
used
he
married
and
obtained
ample
possessions
enjoying
the
favour
of
several
successive
kings
of
abyssinia
and
was
preferred
to
some
considerable
offices
in
the
government
frequent
epistolary
intercourse
took
place
between
him
and
the
king
of
portugal
who
spared
no
expence
to
keep
open
the
interesting
correspondence
in
his
dispatches
covilham
described
the
several
ports
which
he
had
visited
in
india
explained
the
policy
and
disposition
of
the
several
princes
and
pointed
out
the
situation
and
riches
of
the
gold
mines
of
sofala
exhorting
the
king
to
persist
unremittingly
and
vigorously
in
prosecuting
the
discovery
of
the
passage
to
india
around
the
southern
extremity
of
africa
which
he
asserted
to
be
attended
with
little
danger
and
affirmed
that
the
cape
was
well
known
in
india
he
is
said
to
have
accompanied
his
letters
and
descriptions
with
a
chart
in
which
the
cape
and
all
the
cities
on
the
coast
of
africa
were
exactly
represented
which
he
had
received
in
india
from
a
moor
covilham
was
afterwards
seen
by
and
intimately
acquainted
with
francesco
alvarez
his
historian
who
was
sent
on
an
embassy
into
abyssinia
by
emmanuel
king
of
portugal
alvarez
who
appears
to
have
been
a
priest
calls
covilham
his
spiritual
son
and
says
that
he
had
been
years
in
great
credit
with
so
he
calls
the
king
of
abyssinia
and
all
the
court
during
all
which
time
he
had
never
confessed
his
sins
except
to
god
in
secret
because
the
priests
of
that
country
were
not
in
use
to
keep
secret
what
had
been
committed
to
them
in
confession
this
would
protract
the
residence
of
covilham
in
abyssinia
at
least
to
the
year
or
but
how
long
he
may
have
lived

in
strict
conformity

the

to
precede
our

the
maritime
route
from

india
by
the
portuguese
which
did
not

more
regular
to

the

of
portuguese
navigation
and
discovery
to
its
full
completion
than
to
break
down
that
original
and
vast

into
fragments
we
might
indeed
have
stopt
with
the

voyage
of
de

effected

as

considered

authentic

carries
on

to
the

it
seemed
preferable
to
retain
this
curious
original

entire
it
is
obvious
that
castaneda
must
have
used
the
original
journals
of
de
gama
and
other
early
portuguese
commanders
or
of
some
persons
engaged
in
the
voyages
and
transactions

often
forgets

most
high

our
dread
king

so
important

weighty
a

a

of
the
great

which
our
portuguese
have
performed
in
the
discovery

conquest
of

that
i
often
thought
to
relinquish
the
attempt
but
as
these
noble
deeds
were
principally
undertaken
and
performed
for
the
glory
of
almighty
god
the
conversion
of
the
barbarous
nations
to
the
christian
faith
and
the
great
honour
of

as
by
the
power

of
the
omnipotent
such
fortunate
success
has
been
granted
to

i

i
therefore
trust
entirely
to
the
aid

of
the

in

thereof
to

alone
and
its
earthly
praise
to
your
excellent

and
the

don
manuel
your
father
of
famous
and
happy
memory
although
these
glorious
deeds
are
well
known
and
spread
abroad
over
the
world
they
yet
can
not
be
sufficiently
made
manifest
unless
set
forth
in
writing
by
means
of
which
their
memory
may
endure
for
ever
and
remain
always
as
if
present
to
the
readers
as
history
hath
perpetuated
the
actions
of
the
greeks
and
romans
which
are
of
such
high
antiquity
of
other
transactions
nothing
inferior
to
theirs
perhaps
even
far
greater
which
have
been
performed
by
other
nations
there
is
little
or
no
memory
because
these
do
not
remain
recorded
by
history
such
are
those
of
the
assyrians
medes
and
persians
of
the
africans
against
the
romans
of
the
suevi
against
julius
caesar
of
the
spaniards
in
recovering
their

from

principally
of

pious
kings
of

your
glorious
ancestors
don
alonso
henriques
don
sancho
his

and
don
alonso
who
acquired
the
kingdoms
of
portugal
and

by
great
and
wonderful
deeds
of
arms
of
all
which
there
hardly
remaineth
any
memory
for
want
of
having
been
duly
recorded
by
writing
so
likewise
of
those
actions
which
have
been
performed
in
india
only
as
it
were
of
yesterday
the
exact
memory
of
them
is
confined
to
four
persons
and
if
they
were
to
die
all
remembrance
of
these
transactions
must
have
ended
to
their
great
dishonour
considering
these
things
i
resolved
to
record
these
noble
deeds
which
the
subjects
of
your
highness
have
performed
in
the
discovery
and
conquest
of
india
which
have
never
been
surpassed
in
valour
or
even
equalled
in
any
age
or
country
leaving
all
mention
of
the
conquests
of
cyrus
and
other
barbarians
and
even
taking
into
the
account
the
deeds
of
alexander
so
famous
over
all
the
world
which
are
as
nothing
compared
to
what
has
been
performed
since
india
became
frequented
by
the
portuguese
no
more
than
a
dead
lion
can
be
likened
to
one
alive
the
conquests
of
alexander
were
all
by
land
and
achieved
by
himself
in
person
against
nations
who
were
little
trained
or
accustomed
to
feats
of
arms
but
the
portuguese
conquest
of
india
was
performed
by
the
captains
of
your
highness
after
a
voyage
by
sea
of
a
year
and
eight
months
going
almost
around
the
globe
from
the
utmost
limits
of
the
west
through
the
vast
and
bottomless
ocean
seeing
only
the
heaven
and
the
water
a
thing
never
before
attempted
by
man
and
hardly
even
imagined
after
surmounting
hunger
and
thirst
and
daily
exposure
to
furious
storms
and
a
thousand
dangers
in
the
voyage
they
had
to
encounter
great
and
cruel
battles
on
their
arrival
in
india
not
against
men
armed
only
with
bows
and
spears
as
in
the
time
of
alexander
but
with
people
of
stout
and
tried
courage
and
experienced
in
war
having
ordinance
and
more
numerous
even
than
the
portuguese
besides
many
other
excellent
weapons
the
power
of
these
men
against
whom
the
subjects
of
your
highness
had
to
contend
was
infinitely
greater
than
that
of
king
porus
against
whom
alexander
had
to
encounter
yet
the
portuguese
though
few
in
number
uniformly
had
the
victory
and
never
retired
from
the
war
as
was
done
by
alexander
leaving
the
actions
of
the
greeks
and
considering
what
was
performed
by
the
romans
with
their
innumerable
armies
and
vast
fleets
which
seemed
to
cover
the
face
of
the
sea
and
by
means
of
which
they
thought
to
have
conquered
the
whole
earth
yet
they
never
adventured
beyond
the
red
sea
neither
was
the
greatest
of
their
famous
victories
comparable
to
those
battles
which
have
been
fought
by
our
men
in
india
in
which
most
invincible
prince
the
great
prosperity
of
your
father
and
you
is
well
known
as
without
moving
from
your
palace
discoveries
and
conquests
have
been
achieved
by
your
captains
more
extensive
than
ever
were
discovered
or
conquered
by
any
prince
in
person
there
never
was
any
conquest
either
by
the
barbarians

or
romans
of
any
thing
like
equal
difficulty
with
this
of

neither
any
kings
or
captains
of
any
of
these
nations
equal
in
valour
and
conduct
to
those
of
your
father
and
yourself
as
will
manifestly
appear
from
the
whole
tenor
of
the
following
history
the
great
actions
which
the
subjects
of
your
highness
have
worthily
accomplished
must
be
deemed
to
have
been
permitted
and
appointed
by
the
providence
of
god
that
so
those
barbarians
with
their
vain
idols
and
the
false
sectaries
of
mahomet
might
be
brought
into
the
catholic
faith
as
at
this
time
great
numbers
have
been
added
to
the
christian
religion
for
since
these
great
exploits
your
highness
as
a
most
godly
and
christian
prince
hath
taken
especial
care
and
hath
given
command
that
the
christian
doctrine
of
the
of
the
company
of
should
be
taught
in
india
which
you
ordered
to
be
brought
from
rome
and
have
always
supported
at
your
expence
thus
likewise
you
have
erected
and
founded
the
noble
and
sumptuous
university
of
coimbra
to
augment
the
honour
and
reputation
of
your
kingdom
where
besides
many
divines
and
colleges
of
poor
begging
friars
to
expound
the
evangelical
law
there
are
temporal
men
also
to
instruct
those
of
your
subjects
that
defend
and
enlarge
the
commonwealth
by
deeds
of
arms
and
those
who
adorn
the
same
by
means
of
learning
all
these
heroic
virtues
of
your
highness
being
well
known
to
me
have
encouraged
me
to
publish
this
work
and
others
which
have
some
taste
of
learning
that
they
may
remain
a
perpetual
memorial
of
the
noble
deeds
of
so
many
gentlemen
and
knights
of
portugal
your
subjects
in
this
i
have
been
much
forwarded
by
having
been
in
india
where
i
sojourned
with
my
father
who
was
sent
into
that
country
by
your
highness
as
a
judge
i
spent
all
my
youth
in
the
pursuit
of
learning
and
in
the
study
of
ancient
historians
being
in
india
i
set
myself
with
all
diligence
to
learn
and
understand
all
that
had
been
done
in
regard
to
the
discovery
and
conquest
of
that
country
by
the
portuguese
with
the
intention
of
making
the
same
known
and
common
to
all
men
by
my
inquiries
and
through
the
information
derived
from
sundry
gentlemen
and
captains
both
such
as
were
actually
present
in
the
various
transactions
and
employed
in
their
execution
as
by
others
who
were
engaged
in
counselling
and
preparing
the
means
of
their
being
performed
i
have
derived
much
authentic
information
as
likewise
by
the
perusal
of
many
letters
and
memorials
which
were
written
by
men
of
credit
and
reputation
all
of
which
i
have
examined
as
evidences
of
the
authenticity
of
my
work
both
while
in
india
and
since
my
return
into
portugal
as
the
matters
i
meant
to
write
of
were
many
so
it
became
necessary
for
me
to
acquire
information
from
many
sources
and
as
those
whom
i
examined
were
upon
oath
it
is
lawful
for
me
to
bring
them
forward
as
sure
evidence
in
these
researches
some
of
these
men
had
to
be
sought
after
in
almost
every
part
of
portugal
and
being
separated
in
sundry
places
my
inquiries
have
occasioned
great
travel
of
my
person
and
much
expence
to
which
i
have
devoted
the
greater
part
of
my
life
and
have
constituted
the
preparation
for
this
work
my
sole
recreation
since
my
residence
in
the
university
of
coimbra
in
the
service
of
your
highness
i
have
joined
together
all
these
informations
which
together
with
the
duties
of
my
office
have
caused
much
toil
both
of
body
and
mind
having
now
accomplished
the
composition
of
this
book
and
others
i
most
humbly
offer
the
same
to
your
highness
and
after
many
and
most
fortunate
years
of
governing
i
pray
god
to
take
you
from
the
transitory
seignory
of
this
earth
and
to
receive
you
into
the
perpetual
joys
of
heaven

i
steps
taken
by
the
king
of
portugal
john
ii
preparatory
to
the
discovery
of
don
john
the
second
of
that
name
and
thirteenth
king
of
portugal
considering
that
all
spices
drugs
precious
stones
and
other
riches
which
came
from
venice
were
brought
out
of
the
east
and
being
a
prince
of
great
penetration
and
high
emprize
he
was
greatly
desirous
to
enlarge
his
kingdom
and
to
propagate
the
knowledge
of
the
christian
faith
to
distant
regions
he
resolved
therefore
to
discover
the
way
by
sea
to
the
country
whence
such
prodigious
riches
were
brought
that
his
subjects
might
thereby
be
enriched
and
that
his
kingdom
might
acquire
those
commodities
which
had
hitherto
been
brought
by
way
of
venice
he
was
much
encouraged
to
this
enterprise
by
learning
that
there
were
christians
in
india
governed
by
a
powerful
monarch
called
presbyter
john
who
was
reported
to
be
a
christian
prince
and
to
whom
he
thought
proper
to
send
ambassadors
that
an
intercourse
of
friendship
might
be
established
between
them
and
their
subjects
he
consulted
therefore
with
the
cosmographers
of
the
time
whom
he
directed
to
proceed
according
to
the
example
already
given
in
sailing
along
the
coast
of
guinea
which
had
been
formerly
discovered
by
command
of
the
prince
his
uncle
master
of
the
order
of
christ
accordingly
bartholomew
diaz
one
of
the
officers
of
the
royal
storehouse
at
lisbon
was
sent
upon
this
expedition
who
discovered
that
great
and
monstrous
cape
now
called
of
good
hope
which
was
unknown
to
our
ancestors
finding
it
both
terrible
and
dangerous
he
yet
passed
leagues
beyond
to
a
river
which
he
named
del
whence
he
returned
into
portugal
in
this
voyage
diaz
gave
those
names
which
they
still
retain
to
the
ports
harbours
and
rivers
where
he
took
in
fresh
water
and
erected
certain
marks
with
crosses
and
the
royal
arms
of
portugal
the
last
of
which
was
placed
on
a
rock
named
pennol
de
la
fifteen
leagues
on
this
side
of
the
before
mentioned
river
diaz
returned
from
this
voyage
without
having
procured
any
intelligence
concerning
india
as
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
coast
which
he
visited
and
discovered
were
ignorant
black
savages
on
the
return
of
diaz
king
john
resolved
to
attempt
the
discovery
of
india
by
land
for
which
purpose
he
had
formerly
sent
friar
antonio
de
lisboa
by
land
in
company
with
a
lay
person
but
as
they
were
ignorant
of
the
arabic
language
they
could
not
travel
into
those
parts
and
went
no
farther
than
jerusalem
whence
they
returned
into
portugal
without
having
acquired
any
knowledge
of
the
object
of
their
journey
yet
the
king
continued
to
prosecute
this
discovery
of
india
by
land
for
which
he
employed
two
of
his
own
servants
pedro
de
covillian
and
alonso
de
payva
both
versant
in
the
arabic
language
who
were
instructed
to
search
out
the
dominions
of
presbyter
john
and
the
country
whence
the
spices
and
drugs
were
brought
to
venice
and
to
inquire
whether
there
were
any
navigation
from
the
southern
extremity
of
africa
to
india
to
these
men
he
gave
a
chart
which
was
extracted
from
a
map
of
the
world
by
calsadilla
bishop
of
viseo
an
eminent
astronomer
he
gave
them
likewise
a
general
letter
of
credit
and
safe
conduct
requiring
them
to
be
assisted
and
protected
and
supplied
with
money
in
whatever
kingdoms
or
countries
they
might
travel
ordering
them
to
receive
crowns
from
the
chest
of
the
orchard
of
almeryn
for
their
charges
of
this
sum
they
took
what
they
deemed
necessary
to
bear
their
expences
till
their
arrival
at
valentia
in
arragon
placing
the
rest
in
the
bank
of
bartholomew
of
florence
to
be
repaid
at
valentia
receiving
their
audience
of
leave
from
king
john
in
presence
of
don
manuel
duke
of
viseo
afterwards
king
they
departed
from
santaxen
on
the
may
and
came
to
naples
on
st
johns
day
of
that
year
whence
they
were
forwarded
by
the
sons
of
cosmo
de
medici
and
went
to
rhodes
and
thence
to
alexandria
from
this
place
they
travelled
as
merchants
to
cairo
whence
they
went
in
company
with
certain
moors
of
fez
and
tremesen
to
toro
a
harbour
on
the
arabian
coast
of
the
red
sea
they
here
learned
many
things
respecting
the
indies
and
of
the
trade
from
the
red
sea
to
calicut
and
going
from
toro
to
a
place
on
the
coast
of
ethiopia
they
went
to
the
port
of
aden
the
travellers
here
separated
alonso
de
payva
passing
over
to
the
emperor
of
ethiopia
erroneously
called
presbyter
john
for
he
of
whom
marco
polo
speaks
under
that
title
as
governing
all
the
indies
and
whose
country
joins
with
the
great
khan
of
kathay
was
vanquished
and
slain
in
a
battle
by
that
sovereign
at
which
time
his
kingdom
was
put
an
end
to
and
no
one
of
that
race
or
title
has
since
reigned
yet
alonso
de
payva
actually
believed
that
the
emperor
of
ethiopia
was
presbyter
john
having
learnt
that
he
was
a
christian
king
over
a
christian
nation
as
shall
be
more
particularly
declared
hereafter
at
their
separation
they
agreed
to
meet
again
at
cairo
when
each
had
executed
his
part
of
the
royal
orders
pedro
de
covillian
sailed
from
aden
for
the
indies
in
a
ship
belonging
to
the
moors
of
cananor
and
went
to
calicut
and
the
island
of
goa
where
he
acquired
complete
information
respecting
the
spices
of
india
the
commodities
which
come
from
other
places
and
the
towns
of
the
indies
the
names
of
all
which
he
inserted
but
ill
written
in
his
chart
from
india
he
went
to
sofala
where
he
procured
information
respecting
the
great
island
of
st
lawrence
called
the
island
of
the
moon
by
the
moors
observing
that
the
natives
of
sofala
were
black
like
those
of
guinea
he
concluded
that
all
the
coast
between
was
under
subjection
to
the
negroes
and
consequently
that
navigation
was
practicable
from
guinea
to
sofala
and
thence
to
the
indies
returning
from
sofala
he
went
to
ormus
and
thence
to
cairo
where
he
learnt
that
alonso
de
payva
was
dead
and
meant
to
have
returned
to
portugal
he
chanced
to
meet
at
cairo
two
spanish
jews
rabbi
abraham
a
native
of
viseo
and
joseph
born
in
lamego
who
after
the
departure
of
covillian
and
payva
from
portugal
had
told
the
king
that
they
had
been
in
cairo
where
they
had
received
much
information
concerning
ormus
and
of
its
trade
with
the
indies
from
these
jews
covillian
received
letters
from
the
king
directed
to
him
and
payva
ordering
them
to
return
along
with
the
jews
if
they
had
seen
all
that
he
had
given
them
in
charge
if
they
had
not
executed
all
his
original
instructions
they
were
now
directed
to
send
by
the
jews
an
exact
account
of
all
the
knowledge
they
had
acquired
and
to
use
their
utmost
efforts
to
visit
presbyter
john
and
to
give
all
the
information
in
their
power
respecting
ormus
to
rabbi
abraham
who
had
sworn
by
his
law
not
to
return
to
portugal
without
visiting
that
place
on
receiving
these
letters
covillian
changed
his
intention
of
returning
into
portugal
and
dispatched
joseph
there
with
letters
to
the
king
giving
an
account
of
all
that
he
had
seen
and
learnt
in
india
and
sofala
and
transmitted
the
chart
on
which
he
had
inserted
all
the
places
he
had
visited
in
these
letters
he
informed
the
king
that
the
emperor
of
ethiopia
was
assuredly
the
same
with
presbyter
john
but
my
opinion
is
that
this
is
an
error
as
this
sovereign
has
no
such
name
in
his
own
dominions
as
i
shall
more
clearly
shew
hereafter
on
the
departure
of
joseph
covillian
and
rabbi
abraham
went
to
ormus
and
thence
back
to
the
red
sea
whence
covillian
sent
abraham
into
portugal
with
letters
to
the
king
containing
all
the
information
acquired
in
this
part
of
the
expedition
and
intimating
his
determination
to
go
into
the
dominions
of
presbyter
john
this
he
accordingly
did
and
came
to
the
presence
of
the
then
emperor
of
ethiopia
named
alexander
to
whom
he
delivered
the
letters
with
which
he
had
been
entrusted
by
the
king
of
portugal
for
that
monarch
alexander
received
him
courteously
and
seemed
much
pleased
with
the
letters
of
the
king
of
portugal
as
being
from
so
very
distant
a
christian
prince
yet
did
not
seem
to
attach
much
credit
or
importance
to
them
but
he
gave
all
honour
and
many
gifts
to
covillian
when
covillian
was
ready
to
depart
from
ethiopia
and
awaited
leave
for
that
purpose
which
he
had
solicited
alexander
died
and
was
succeeded
by
a
new
emperor
named
who
could
never
be
prevailed
on
to
allow
of
his
departure
neither
could
he
procure
leave
for
that
purpose
from
the
next
emperor
david
the
son
of
nahu
so
that
covillian
had
to
remain
in
ethiopia
and
never
returned
into
portugal
from
that
time
king
john
never
heard
more
of
him
and
therefore
concluded
that
he
was
dead
nothing
having
ever
been
received
from
him
respecting
his
travels
except
what
was
contained
in
the
letters
carried
by
the
jews
as
before
mentioned
there
came
afterwards
to
lisbon
a
friar
from
this
country
of
presbyter
john
who
was
received
courteously
by
the
king
and
on
whose
reports
of
great
things
concerning
that
country
the
king
determined
to
proceed
in
making
a
discovery
of
the
way
to
the
indies
by
sea
he
accordingly
gave
orders
to
john
de
bragança
his
surveyor
of
the
forests
to
cut
down
timber
for
building
two
small
ships
for
that
voyage
but
king
john
died
and
was
succeeded
by
king
manuel
of
glorious
memory
who
had
been
chosen
by
divine
providence
to
accomplish
the
discovery
of
these
countries
by
which
the
christian
faith
hath
been
greatly
extended
the
royal
house
of
portugal

honoured

the
subjects
wonderfully
enriched

years
and
on

he
was
succeeded
by
don

a
prince
of

great
mind
bent
upon
high
enterprise
and
prone
to
undertake
and
execute
things
beyond
the
ordinary
reach
of
human
knowledge
even
more
than
was
alexander
the
great
being
exceedingly
desirous
to
prosecute
the
discovery

indies
which
had
been
begun
by
his
predecessor

him

saluted

with
many
guns
and
the
sound
of
trumpets
all
heartily
rejoicing
for
their
safe
meeting
and
good
fortune
in
this
their
first
essay
of
danger
next
day
being
the
of
july
the
fleet
reached
the
islands
of
st
jago
and
came
to
anchor
in
the
bay
of
santa
maria
where
it
remained
seven
days
taking
in
fresh
water
and
repairing
the
yards
and
other
parts
of
their
rigging
which
had
been
damaged
in
the
late
storm
on

the
of
august

went
on
his
voyage
after
taking
leave
of

who
now
returned
to
portugal
proceeding
for
the
cape
of
good
hope
with
all
his
squadron
de
la
gama
the
gulf
into
the
and
sailed
all
august
september
and
october
suffering
many
great
tempests
of
violent
wind
and
rain
so
that
they
often
expected
instant
death
at
length
on
saturday
the
november
they
got
sight
of
land
at
nine
in
the
forenoon
at
which
they
were
greatly
rejoiced
and
being
all
together
the
captains
saluted
the
general
all
dressed
in
their
best
array
and
having
their
ships
all
decorated
with
flags
not
knowing
the
coasts
they
sailed
along
until
the
tuesday
following
when
they
had
a
perfect
view
of
a
low
shore
in
which
was
a
great
bay
that
appeared
convenient
for
the
ships
to
take
in
water
into
which
they
all
entered
and
came
to
anchor
this
place
was
afterwards
named
de
santa
or
st
helen
bay
the
people
of
the
country
as
our
men
afterwards
found
were
small
black
savages
clothed
in
the
skins
of
beasts
somewhat
like
french
cloaks
having
curious
wrought
wooden
cases
for
their
privities
and
in
speaking
they
seemed
always
sighing
these
natives
were
armed
with
oak
staves
hardened
in
the
fire
pointed
with
the
horns
of
beasts
somewhat
burnt
or
hardened
with
fire
which
served
them
for
swords
they
lived
on
the
roots
of
herbs
and
on
sea
wolves
and
whales
which
are
very
numerous
in
this
country
likewise
on
sea
crows
and
gulls
they
also
eat
of
certain
beasts
which
they
call
gazelas
and
other
beasts
and
birds
which
the
land
produces
and
they
have
dogs
which
bark
like
those
of
portugal
the
general
after
the
squadron
was
brought
to
anchor
sent
coello
in
a
boat
along
the
shore
in
search
of
water
which
he
found
four
leagues
from
the
anchoring
ground
at
a
place
which
he
named
jago
whence
all
the
ships
provided
themselves
with
fresh
water
next
day
the
general
with
the
other
captains
escorted
by
some
of
the
people
went
on
shore
to
view
the
natives
and
to
endeavour
to
learn
what
distance
the
cape
of
good
hope
was
from
thence
for
the
chief
pilot
who
had
been
on
the
voyage
with
diaz
had
departed
thence
on
returning
in
the
morning
into
the
open
sea
with
a
fair
wind
and
had
passed
it
during
the
night
and
had
not
come
near
the
shore
when
outward
bound
wherefore
he
did
not
certainly
know
its
situation
nor
was
he
acquainted
with
its
appearance
but
conjectured
it
might
be
thirty
leagues
from
where
they
then
were
at
the
utmost
when
the
general
was
on
shore
he
overtook
one
of
the
natives
who
was
going
to
gather
honey
at
the
foot
of
a
bush
where
it
is
deposited
by
the
bees
without
any
hive
with
this
person
he
returned
to
the
ship
thinking
to
have
got
an
interpreter
but
no
one
on
board
the
squadron
could
understand
his
language
the
general
commanded
this
man
to
have
meat
and
drink
and
set
him
on
shore
next
day
well
dressed
that
he
might
return
satisfied
to
his
countrymen
accordingly
the
day
following
this
man
came
down
to
the
shore
abreast
of
the
ships
with
about
fifteen
more
natives
and
the
general
went
ashore
carrying
with
him
spices
gold
and
pearls
to
try
if
these
people
had
any
knowledge
of
these
things
but
from
the
little
estimation
with
which
these
articles
were
viewed
it
was
concluded
that
the
natives
had
no
knowledge
of
them
the
general
distributed
among
the
natives
some
small
bells
tin
rings
counters
and
such
toys
which
they
received
joyfully
and
from
that
time
till
next
saturday
morning
great
numbers
of
the
natives
resorted
to
the
fleet
whence
they
went
back
to
their
towns
one
fernan
veloso
craved
leave
of
the
general
to
accompany
the
natives
to
their
habitations
that
he
might
see
their
manner
of
living
on
going
along
with
them
the
natives
took
a
sea
wolf
which
they
roasted
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
for
their
supper
after
which
they
made
veloso
return
to
the
fleet
and
it
appeared
to
him
that
the
natives
had
armed
themselves
meaning
to
attack
our
people
on
his
return
veloso
saw
that
he
was
secretly
followed
wherefore
he
hastened
to
the
shore
and
hailed
the
ships
on
this
the
general
who
was
then
at
supper
looked
out
towards
the
land
where
he
saw
numbers
of
the
savages
following
veloso
he
therefore
gave
orders
for
all
the
ships
to
be
in
readiness
against
an
attack
and
went
himself
on
shore
with
several
others
unarmed
not
dreading
any
harm
on
seeing
our
boats
coming
towards
the
shore
the
savages
began
to
run
away
with
much
clamour
but
when
our
people
landed
they
returned
and
set
upon
them
furiously
throwing
their
darts
and
using
other
weapons
which
constrained
our
people
to
take
to
their
boats
in
all
haste
taking
veloso
along
with
them
yet
in
this
scuffle
the
general
and
three
others
were
wounded
the
negroes
returned
to
their
towns
and
during
four
days
after
while
our
ships
remained
in
the
bay
they
never
saw
any
more
of
the
natives
so
that
they
had
no
opportunity
to
revenge
the
injury
they
had
done
some
commerce
took
place
between
the
portuguese
and
the
hottentot
natives
around
st
elena
bay
by
means
of
signs
and
gestures
when
the
fleet
received
plenty
of
excellent
fresh
provisions
in
exchange
for
clothes
hawks
bells
glass
beads
and
other
toys
but
this
friendly
intercourse
was
interrupted
through
the
imprudence
of
a
portuguese
young
man
named
veloso
delighted
with
the
novelty
of
the
scene
and
anxious
to
see
the
manners
of
the
natives
more
intimately
he
obtained
permission
to
accompany
them
to
their
huts
where
a
sea
calf
was
dressed
in
the
hottentot
fashion
to
his
great
astonishment
disgusted
at
their
loathsome
cookery
he
rose
abruptly
and
was
impatient
to
depart
and
was
accompanied
by
the
natives
on
his
way
back
to
the
ships
with
the
utmost
good
humour
veloso
however
became
apprehensive
of
personal
danger
and
horridly
vociferated
for
assistance
on
his
approach
to
the
shore
coellos
boat
immediately
put
off
to
bring
him
on
board
and
the
natives
fled
to
the
woods
these
needless
apprehensions
on
both
sides
were
increased
by
mutual
ignorance
of
each
others
language
and
led
to
hostilities
while
de
gama
was
taking
the
altitude
of
the
sun
with
an
astrolabe
some
hottentots
sprung
from
an
ambush
and
threw
their
spears
headed
with
horn
very
dexterously
among
the
portuguese
by
which
the
general
and
several
others
were
wounded
on
this
occasion
the
portuguese
deemed
it
prudent
to
retreat
to
their
ships
having
taken
in
fresh
water
and
provisions
in
st
elena
bay
the
squadron
left
that
place
on
the
forenoon
of
thursday
the
november
with
the
wind
at
and
steered
for
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
on
the
evening
of
the
following
saturday
came
in
sight
of
that
cape
but
on
account
of
the
wind
being
contrary
he
had
to
stand
out
to
sea
all
day
and
turned
towards
the
land
as
night
set
in
in
that
manner
he
continued
plying
to
windward
until
the
following
wednesday
which
was
the
of
november
when
he
doubled
the
cape
with
a
fair
wind
sounding
the
trumpets
of
all
the
ships
and
making
every
demonstration
of
joy
but
placing
the
chief
confidence
in
god
that
his
providence
would
guide
and
protect
them
in
accomplishing
the
enterprise
in
which
they
were
engaged
in
this
part
of
the
voyage
the
greatest
proofs
of
courage
and
resolution
were
evinced
by
de
gama
while
endeavouring
to
double
this
formidable
and
almost
unknown
cape
owing
to
contrary
winds
and
stormy
weather
the
waves
rose
mountain
high
at
one
time
his
ships
were
heaved
up
to
the
clouds
and
seemed
the
next
moment
precipitated
into
the
bottomless
abyss
of
the
ocean
the
wind
was
piercingly
cold
and
so
boisterous
that
the
commands
of
the
pilot
could
seldom
be
heard
amid
the
din
of
the
warring
elements
while
the
dismal
and
almost
constant
darkness
increased
the
danger
of
their
situation
sometimes
the
gale
drove
them
irresistibly
to
the
southwards
while
at
other
times
they
had
to
lay
to
or
to
tack
to
windward
difficultly
preserving
the
course
they
had
already
made
during
any
gloomy
intervals
of
cessation
from
the
tempest
the
sailors
exhausted
by
fatigue
and
abandoned
to
despair
surrounded
de
gama
entreating
him
not
to
devote
himself
and
them
to
inevitable
destruction
as
the
gale
could
no
longer
be
weathered
and
they
must
all
be
buried
in
the
waves
if
he
persisted
in
the
present
course
the
firmness
of
the
general
was
not
to
be
shaken
by
the
pusillanimity
and
remonstrances
of
the
crew
on
which
a
formidable
conspiracy
was
entered
into
against
him
of
which
he
received
timely
information
from
his
brother
paulo
with
his
assistance
and
that
of
a
few
who
remained
stedfast
to
their
duty
the
leading
conspirators
and
even
all
the
pilots
were
put
in
irons
whilst
de
gama
and
his
small
remnant
of
faithful
followers
remained
day
and
night
at
the
helm
undismayed
at
the
dangers
and
difficulties
that
surrounded
them
at
length
on
wednesday
the
november
all
the
squadron
safely
doubled
the
tremendous
promontory
continuing
the
voyage
along
the
coast
beyond
the
cape
they
saw
great
numbers
of
large
and
small
cattle
as
they
passed
all
well
grown
and
fat
but
could
perceive
no
towns
as
the
villages
inhabited
by
the
natives
are
all
farther
inland
the
houses
being
of
earth
covered
with
straw
the
natives
were
all
somewhat
black
clothed
like
those
they
had
seen
at
st
elena
bay
speaking
the
same
language
and
using
similar
darts
together
with
some
other
kinds
of
arms
both
for
defence
and
assault
the
country
is
very
pleasant
being
diversified
with
wood
and
water
and
adjoining
to
the
cape
on
the
east
side
they
found
a
great
harbour
now
called
false
bay
almost
six
leagues
wide
at
the
mouth
and
running
about
as
much
into
the
land
having
thus
doubled
the
cape
the
squadron
came
on
the
sunday
after
being
st
katherine
day
november
to
the
of
st
blaze
which
is
sixty
leagues
beyond
the
cape
and
is
a
very
large
bay
exceeding
safe
in
all
winds
except
the
north
the
natives
here
resembled
those
already
seen
in
dress
and
arms
the
country
produces
many
large
elephants
and
numerous
oxen
of
vast
size
and
extremely
fat
some
of
which
have
no
horns
on
some
of
the
fattest
of
these
the
natives
were
seen
riding
on
pannels
stuffed
with
rye
straw
as
is
used
in
spain
and
having
a
frame
of
wood
like
a
saddle
such
of
them
as
they
choose
to
sell
they
mark
by
means
of
a
piece
of
wood
like
the
shaft
of
one
of
their
arrows
put
through
the
nose
in
this
harbour
about
three
shots
from
the
shore
there
is
a
rock
much
frequented
by
sea
wolves
as
large
as
great
bears
very
wild
and
fierce
with
long
great
teeth
these
animals
are
very
dangerous
and
will
attack
men
and
their
skins
are
so
hard
as
not
to
be
pierced
with
spears
unless
pushed
with
much
force
and
valour
these
animals
resemble
lions
and
their
young
bleat
like
kids
one
day
that
our
men
went
to
this
rock
for
amusement
they
saw
at
least
three
thousand
of
these
animals
old
and
young
on
this
rock
also
there
are
great
numbers
of
birds
as
large
as
ducks
which
do
not
fly
having
no
feathers
in
their
wings
and
which
bray
like
so
many
asses
having
thus
arrived
at
the
bay
of
st
blaze
and
lying
there
at
anchor
the
general
caused
all
the
provisions
to
be
taken
out
of
the
and
divided
among
the
others
and
then
burned
the
as
the
king
had
ordered
in
this
business
and
other
needful
employments
for
their
safety
in
the
remainder
of
the
voyage
they
were
occupied
in
that
bay
for
ten
days
on
the
friday
after
their
arrival
about
ninety
of
the
natives
made
their
appearance
some
on
the
shore
and
others
on
the
hills
on
which
the
general
and
the
captains
went
to
the
shore
having
their
boats
crews
well
armed
and
even
taking
ordinance
with
them
to
avoid
the
same
accident
which
had
happened
at
st
elena
bay
when
near
the
shore
the
general
threw
some
bells
on
the
land
which
the
negroes
pickt
up
and
some
of
them
came
so
near
as
to
take
the
bells
out
of
his
hands
he
much
wondered
at
this
familiarity
as
diaz
had
informed
him
when
he
was
in
those
parts
the
natives
all
ran
away
and
would
never
approach
near
enough
to
be
seen
and
conversed
with
finding
them
thus
gentle
contrary
to
his
expectation
he
went
on
land
with
his
men
and
bartered
red
caps
with
the
negroes
for
ivory
bracelets
which
they
wore
on
their
arms
next
saturday
the
natives
came
to
the
shore
to
the
number
of
more
than
two
hundred
including
their
children
and
brought
with
them
twelve
oxen
and
four
sheep
when
our
people
went
on
shore
some
of
the
natives
began
to
play
on
four
flutes
in
four
several
tones
making
good
music
on
which
the
general
caused
the
trumpets
to
be
sounded
and
the
natives
danced
with
our
people
thus
the
day
passed
in
mirth
and
feasting
and
in
purchasing
their
oxen
and
sheep
on
sunday
a
still
greater
number
of
the
natives
came
down
to
the
shore
having
several
women
among
them
and
bringing
a
number
of
oxen
for
sale
after
the
sale
of
one
of
the
oxen
some
of
our
people
noticed
some
young
negroes
hidden
among
certain
bushes
who
had
with
them
the
weapons
of
the
older
people
from
which
it
was
conjectured
that
some
treason
was
intended
upon
this
the
general
caused
our
people
to
remove
to
a
place
of
greater
security
and
were
followed
by
the
negroes
to
the
landing
place
the
negroes
now
gathered
together
as
if
they
meant
to
fight
the
portuguese
on
which
the
general
being
unwilling
to
harm
them
embarked
in
the
boats
with
all
his
people
and
then
commanded
two
pieces
of
brass
ordnance
to
be
fired
off
on
which
they
were
much
amazed
and
scampered
off
in
confusion
leaving
their
weapons
behind
after
this
the
general
ordered
a
cross
or
pillar
having
the
arms
of
portugal
to
be
set
upon
the
shore
but
the
negroes
pulled
it
down
immediately
even
before
our
people
retired
after
remaining
ten
days
here
as
before
mentioned
the
fleet
set
sail
for
the
rio
del
infante
on
friday
the
december
being
the
conception
of
our
lady
and
during
this
part
of
the
voyage
there
arose
a
great
storm
with
on
the
eve
of
st
lucy
december
that
all
the
ships
run
under
close
reefed
courses
during
this
storm
they
parted
company
with
nicholas
coello
but
rejoined
the
next
night
after
on
the
december
when
the
gale
abated
they
discovered
land
near
certain
small
rocks
sixty
leagues
from
the
harbour
of
st
blaze
and
five
leagues
from
the
pennon
de
la
cruz
where
diaz
set
up
his
last
stone
pillar
and
fifteen
leagues
short
of
the
rio
del
infante
this
country
was
very
pleasant
and
abounded
in
cattle
becoming
more
sightly
and
with
higher
trees
the
further
our
fleet
sailed
towards
the
east
as
could
be
easily
seen
from
the
ships
as
they
sailed
along
near
the
shore
on
saturday
they
passed
close
within
sight
of
the
rock
la
and
being
loath
to
pass
the
del
they
stood
out
to
sea
till
vespers
when
the
wind
came
round
to
the
east
right
contrary
on
this
the
general
stood
off
and
on
plying
to
windward
till
tuesday
the
december
at
sunset
when
the
wind
changed
to
the
west
which
was
favourable
next
day
at
ten
they
came
to
the
rock
being
sixty
leagues
of
the
place
they
wished
to
have
attained
this
rock
is
the
cause
of
the
great
currents
on
this
coast
which
were
so
powerful
that
the
fleet
had
much
ado
with
a
brisk
favourable
wind
to
stem
the
current
between
that
place
and
rio
infante
in
three
or
four
days
but
at
length
they
joyfully
passed
these
currents
without
damage
as
diaz
had
done
formerly
and
the
general
encouraged
by
his
good
fortune
gave
thanks
to
god
saying
he
verily
believed
it
was
the
good
pleasure
of
god
that
they
should
attain
to
the
discovery
of
the
indies
thus
continuing
the
voyage
till
christmas
day
they
had
discovered
seventy
leagues
to
the
eastwards
and
had
arrived
in
the
latitude
in
which
india
was
said
to
be
in
his
instructions
the
fleet
continued
to
sail
for
so
long
a
time
without
going
to
land
as
to
be
in
want
of
water
insomuch
that
they
had
to
dress
their
provisions
in
sea
water
and
were
forced
to
reduce
the
allowance
of
drink
to
one
pint
of
water
per
man
each
day
but
on
friday
the
january
drawing
near
the
land
the
boats
were
sent
out
to
view
the
coast
where
they
saw
many
negroes
both
men
and
women
all
of
whom
were
of
great
stature
and
followed
our
boats
along
the
coast
as
these
people
appeared
quiet
and
civil
the
general
called
martin
alonzo
who
could
speak
many
of
the
negro
languages
and
desired
him
and
another
to
leap
on
shore
which
they
immediately
did
alonzo
and
his
companion
were
well
received
by
the
natives
especially
by
their
chief
to
whom
the
general
sent
a
jacket
a
pair
of
breeches
and
a
cap
all
of
a
red
colour
and
a
copper
bracelet
of
which
he
was
very
proud
and
returned
thanks
to
the
general
saying
that
he
might
have
any
thing
he
wished
for
or
needed
that
his
country
produced
all
which
as
martin
alonzo
understood
their
language
he
reported
to
the
general
who
was
much
pleased
that
by
this
means
an
intercourse
could
be
opened
with
the
natives
alonzo
and
another
of
our
people
were
accordingly
permitted
by
the
general
to
go
for
one
night
along
with
the
natives
to
their
town
where
the
chief
dressed
himself
out
in
his
new
garments
and
was
beheld
with
much
admiration
by
his
people
in
his
finery
clapping
their
hands
for
joy
this
salutation
was
repeated
three
or
four
times
on
their
way
to
the
town
and
when
there
the
chief
made
the
circuit
of
the
whole
village
that
all
the
people
might
see
and
admire
his
new
and
strange
attire
when
this
ceremonial
was
ended
the
chief
retired
to
his
own
house
where
he
commanded
alonzo
and
his
companion
to
be
well
lodged
and
entertained
and
gave
them
for
supper
a
hen
exactly
the
same
as
one
of
ours
and
a
kind
of
pap
or
porridge
made
of
a
yellow
grain
called
of
which
likewise
they
made
bread
many
of
the
negroes
repaired
that
night
to
their
lodging
to
have
a
near
view
of
the
strangers
and
next
day
the
chief
sent
them
back
to
the
ships
accompanied
by
some
negroes
laden
with
hens
for
the
general
who
returned
thanks
for
the
same
by
means
of
alonzo
his
interpreter
during
five
days
that
our
ships
remained
off
this
coast
no
kind
of
harm
was
done
or
offered
by
the
inhabitants
who
seemed
quiet
and
gentle
and
to
have
many
for
which
reason
he
called
this
place
da
boa
or
the
land
of
good
people
the
town
in
which
martin
alonzo
was
had
its
houses
constructed
of
straw
yet
well
furnished
within
the
women
were
more
numerous
than
the
men
as
in
a
company
of
forty
women
there
were
only
twenty
men
these
people
were
armed
with
long
bows
and
arrows
and
had
darts
headed
with
iron
having
many
copper
bracelets
on
their
arms
and
legs
with
copper
ornaments
in
their
hair
they
have
also
iron
daggers
with
pewter
handles
and
ivory
sheaths
so
that
it
is
manifest
they
have
plenty
of
copper
and
tin
they
have
likewise
abundance
of
salt
which
they
make
from
sea
water
which
they
carry
in
gourds
to
certain
caves
where
the
salt
is
made
they
were
so
fond
of
linen
that
they
gave
a
great
quantity
of
copper
in
exchange
for
an
old
shirt
and
were
so
quiet
and
civil
that
they
brought
water
to
our
boats
from
a
river
about
two
shots
from
the
landing
which
our
people
named
rio
do
cobre
or
copper
river
osorius
places
the
arrival
of
the
portuguese
on
this
part
of
the
coast
a
day
earlier
than
castaneda
and
gives
the
following
additional
information
on
the
january
they
discovered
some
small
islands
about
miles
from
their
last
having
a
very
beautiful
appearance
and
consisting
of
verdant
meadows
intermixed
with
groves
of
lofty
trees
where
they
could
see
the
inhabitants
walking
on
the
shore
in
great
numbers
here
de
gama
landed
and
sent
one
of
his
men
who
was
well
versant
in
the
negro
languages
to
visit
the
king
and
who
was
received
with
much
civility
receiving
presents
of
the
produce
of
the
country
on
his
dismissal
before
leaving
lisbon
de
gama
received
ten
malefactors
on
board
who
had
been
condemned
to
die
but
were
pardoned
on
condition
of
going
on
this
voyage
for
the
purpose
of
being
left
wherever
de
gama
pleased
that
they
might
examine
the
country
and
be
enabled
to
give
him
an
account
of
the
inhabitants
on
his
return
on
setting
sail
from
this
place
de
gama
left
two
of
these
exiles
on
shore
to
inform
themselves
of
the
character
and
manners
of
the
natives
from
this
place
our
fleet
departed
on
the
january
and
proceeding
on
their
voyage
came
to
another
country
of
very
low
land
having
very
thick
tall
trees
and
proceeding
onwards
they
found
a
river
which
was
very
open
at
the
mouth
near
which
he
came
to
anchor
on
thursday
the
of
january
as
the
general
deemed
it
proper
to
examine
this
country
and
to
try
if
any
intelligence
could
be
here
procured
concerning
india
that
same
evening
he
and
his
brother
nicholas
coello
entered
the
river
and
at
next
morning
the
land
was
observed
to
be
extremely
low
and
covered
with
water
having
many
trees
of
great
height
thickly
loaded
with
various
kinds
of
fruits
the
country
appearing
very
pleasant
they
saw
likewise
certain
boats
with
some
of
the
natives
coming
towards
the
ship
at
which
the
general
was
well
pleased
as
he
conceived
from
their
having
some
degree
of
maritime
knowledge
in
these
parts
that
he
could
not
now
be
very
far
from
india
or
at
least
should
soon
hear
news
of
that
country
the
natives
were
negroes
of
good
stature
all
naked
except
each
a
small
apron
of
cloth
made
of
cotton
on
reaching
the
ships
they
came
on
board
without
hesitation
and
behaved
themselves
as
if
they
had
been
long
acquainted
with
our
people
they
were
well
received
and
were
presented
with
bells
and
other
toys
but
did
not
understand
any
of
the
languages
spoken
by
martin
alonzo
or
any
of
the
other
interpreters
on
board
so
that
the
only
intercourse
was
by
signs
they
departed
after
good
entertainment
and
afterwards
they
and
many
others
returned
to
the
ships
in
their
boats
bringing
with
them
such
provisions
as
their
country
afforded
the
natives
seemed
much
satisfied
with
their
reception
and
besides
those
who
came
to
the
ships
by
water
many
others
came
by
land
among
whom
were
several
women
who
were
tolerably
handsome
especially
the
young
maidens
but
all
were
as
naked
as
the
men
they
have
three
holes
in
their
lips
in
which
they
wear
small
pieces
of
tin
by
way
of
ornament
the
natives
took
several
of
our
men
along
with
them
to
make
merry
at
one
of
their
towns
whence
they
brought
water
to
our
ships
after
the
general
had
been
three
days
in
this
river
two
of
the
nobles
or
head
men
of
the
natives
came
on
board
to
visit
him
who
were
naked
like
the
rest
except
that
their
aprons
were
much
larger
and
one
of
them
had
a
handkerchief
on
his
head
embroidered
with
silk
while
the
other
wore
a
nightcap
of
green
satin
observing
their
cleanliness
or
civility
the
general
treated
these
people
courteously
and
gave
them
victuals
apparel
and
other
things
of
which
they
seemed
to
make
but
small
account
and
by
certain
signs
shewn
by
a
young
man
it
was
understood
that
his
country
was
at
a
considerable
distance
where
he
had
seen
ships
as
large
as
ours
this
intelligence
gave
great
hopes
to
our
people
that
the
indies
were
not
far
off
which
was
much
confirmed
by
the
chiefs
who
had
been
on
board
sending
off
for
sale
certain
cloths
made
of
cotton
on
which
there
were
marks
of
ochre
in
respect
of
all
these
encouraging
tokens
the
general
named
this
river
rio
dos
bos
or
river
of
good
signs
and
called
the
place
san
rafael
after
the
name
of
his
own
ship
from
the
signs
of
the
young
men
that
the
country
of
the
head
men
who
had
been
on
board
was
far
off
where
they
had
seen
large
ships
the
general
concluded
that
the
indies
were
still
at
a
great
distance
and
therefore
determined
in
consultation
with
the
other
captains
to
lay
the
ships
aground
to
give
their
bottoms
a
thorough
repair
which
was
done
accordingly
in
this
operation
they
employed
days
during
which
our
people
were
much
afflicted
with
a
grievous
sickness
thought
to
proceed
from
the
air
of
the
country
their
hands
and
feet
became
swelled
and
their
gums
became
so
sore
and
putrid
that
they
could
not
eat
and
the
smell
of
their
breath
was
quite
intolerable
with
this
pestilent
infection
our
people
were
much
discouraged
and
many
of
them
died
the
survivors
being
in
great
trouble
and
perplexity
but
de
gama
took
much
care
and
used
much
diligence
for
their
recovery
and
to
comfort
their
affliction
continually
visiting
the
sick
and
giving
them
such
wholesome
and
medicinal
things
as
he
had
provided
for
his
own
use
through
all
which
many
recovered
who
would
have
died
and
the
rest
were
thereby
greatly
comforted
and
encouraged
having
repaired
the
ships
and
provided
them
with
all
necessaries
that
could
be
procured
at
the
river
of
good
signs
the
fleet
departed
from
thence
on
saturday
the
of
february
at
this
period
two
accidents
occurred
which
had
nearly
frustrated
all
the
hopes
of
this
expedition
de
gama
being
along
side
of
the
ship
commanded
by
his
brother
with
whom
he
wished
to
speak
had
hold
of
the
chains
when
the
boat
was
carried
from
under
him
by
the
force
of
the
current
but
by
immediate
assistance
he
and
his
boats
crew
were
providentially
saved
soon
afterwards
when
the
fleet
was
passing
the
bar
of
the
river
the
ship
of
de
gama
grounded
on
a
sand
bank
and
her
loss
was
for
some
time
considered
as
inevitable
but
she
floated
again
with
the
return
of
the
tide
and
to
their
inexpressible
joy
received
no
damage
as
there
was
little
or
no
wind
the
fleet
stood
out
to
sea
to
avoid
the
shore
and
about
vespers
on
sunday
they
descried
three
small
islands
out
to
sea
about
four
leagues
distant
from
each
other
two
of
these
were
replenished
with
trees
but
the
third
was
quite
bare
seeing
no
cause
to
delay
the
voyage
in
examining
these
islands
de
gama
held
on
for
six
days
coming
always
to
anchor
at
night
on
the
evening
of
thursday
the
first
of
march
they
came
in
sight
of
four
islands
two
of
which
were
near
the
land
and
the
other
two
farther
out
to
sea
and
the
fleet
steered
through
the
channel
next
morning
the
ship
commanded
by
coello
as
being
the
smallest
going
first
but
endeavouring
to
enter
a
certain
harbour
between
the
mainland
and
one
of
these
islands
coello
missed
the
channel
and
ran
aground
on
which
the
other
ships
put
about
and
went
back
they
soon
perceived
seven
or
eight
boats
under
sail
coming
from
the
island
which
was
a
good
league
distant
from
coello
at
which
sight
they
were
much
rejoiced
and
coello
and
his
people
received
them
with
much
demonstration
of
friendship
and
satisfaction
coello
went
along
with
these
people
to
the
general
and
presented
them
saying
that
here
was
a
quite
different
kind
of
people
from
any
they
had
seen
hitherto
then
the
general
commanded
let
them
go
a
seaboard
with
their
as
he
proposed
to
go
with
them
to
their
island
to
anchor
with
his
ships
that
he
might
see
what
kind
of
a
country
it
was
and
if
he
could
learn
any
certain
intelligence
concerning
india
but
the
boats
continued
to
follow
our
ships
making
signals
and
calling
to
our
people
to
wait
for
them
wherefore
the
ships
came
to
anchor
and
the
boats
came
to
our
fleet
the
people
on
board
were
of
good
stature
and
somewhat
black
clothed
in
dresses
of
cotton
striped
with
sundry
colours
some
girdled
to
their
knees
while
others
carried
their
apparel
on
their
shoulders
like
cloaks
their
heads
were
covered
with
kerchiefs
somewhat
wrought
with
silk
and
gold
thread
and
they
were
armed
with
swords
and
daggers
like
moors
in
their
boats
also
they
had
certain
musical
instruments
named
they
came
immediately
on
board
with
as
much
confidence
as
if
they
were
long
acquainted
and
entered
into
familiar
conversation
in
the
language
of
algarve
and
would
not
be
known
as
moors
the
general
ordered
these
people
to
be
well
entertained
and
they
eat
and
drank
willingly
of
whatever
was
set
before
them
after
which
by
means
of
fernan
alvarez
who
could
speak
their
language
he
learned
that
the
island
to
which
they
belonged
was
called
monsambicke
or
mozambique
on
which
was
a
town
full
of
merchants
who
traded
with
the
moors
of
india
who
bring
them
silver
linen
cloth
pepper
ginger
silver
rings
many
pearls
and
rubies
and
that
from
a
country
behind
they
procure
gold
they
offered
likewise
to
conduct
our
people
into
the
harbour
where
they
would
learn
the
truth
of
these
things
more
fully
on
consulting
with
the
other
captains
the
general
determined
upon
going
into
this
harbour
to
examine
more
accurately
into
these
reports
and
to
procure
pilots
to
carry
them
on
their
voyage
as
they
had
no
one
in
the
fleet
who
knew
the
way
nicholas
coello
was
therefore
ordered
to
make
the
first
essay
and
to
take
the
soundings
of
the
bar
his
ship
being
the
smallest
but
in
entering
he
touched
on
the
point
of
the
island
where
he
broke
his
helm
and
was
in
great
danger
of
being
lost
but
by
good
providence
he
got
off
with
no
farther
injury
he
now
found
the
bar
was
quite
safe
and
got
into
the
harbour
where
he
anchored
two
shots
from
the
town
which
is
in
fifteen
degrees
towards
the
south
the
harbour
is
very
good
the
town
is
plentifully
supplied
with
such
provisions
as
the
country
produces
the
houses
being
constructed
of
straw
and
the
inhabitants
moors
who
trade
to
sofala
in
large
vessels
that
have
neither
decks
nor
nails
their
planks
being
sewed
together
with
or
twine
made
from
the
fibres
of
the
cocoa
nut
rind
and
their
sails
of
mats
made
of
the
leaves
of
a
species
of
palm
some
of
these
vessels
use
compasses
of
genoa
and
regulate
their
voyages
by
means
of
quadrants
and
sea
charts
with
these
moors
the
moors
of
india
trade
as
likewise
do
those
from
the
red
sea
because
of
the
gold
which
is
to
be
had
here
on
seeing
our
people
the
moors
of
mozambique
thought
the
portuguese
had
been
turks
whom
they
knew
of
from
the
moors
who
dwell
on
the
red
sea
and
those
who
were
first
at
our
ships
carried
intelligence
to
the
xeque
or
sheik
which
is
the
title
of
the
governor
of
this
island
for
the
king
of
quiloa
in
whose
territories
it
is
situated
though
we
shall
afterwards
have
occasion
to
investigate
this
eastern
coast
of
africa
more
fully
in
editing
particular
voyages
to
its
shores
some
notices
seem
here
to
be
proper
owing
to
his
keeping
at
a
distance
from
the
shore
for
security
the
present
voyage
gives
little
knowledge
of
the
eastern
coast
of
africa
and
it
is
even
difficult
to
assign
the
many
stations
at
which
de
gama
touched
between
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
mozambique
we
have
already
noticed
the
river
of
good
signs
as
being
probably
the
northern
mouth
of
the
delta
of
the
zambeze
now
called
from
a
fort
of
that
name
on
its
banks
the
mouth
of
this
branch
runs
into
the
sea
in
lat
in
his
passage
from
the
de

christmas
land
so
named
from
having
been
discovered
on
christmas
day
and
named

southern

of
covilhams

at
which
he
was
probably
directed
to

have
been
of
some
use
to
direct
his
farther
progress
to
aden
and
thence
to
calicut
or
cananor
on
the
malabar
coast
the
eastern
coast
of
africa
is
hitherto
very
little
known
to
geography
its
trade
being
entirely
confined
to
the
portuguese
who
have
settlements
at
sofala

river

conceal
all

jealousy

is
said
to
have
once
been
in
contemplation
by
the
british
government
to
employ
sir
home
popham
to
make
a
survey
of
this
coast
but
this
design
was
never
executed
commodore

remained
on
this
station
for
a
considerable
time
and
much
information
may
be
expected
from
his
journal
some
drawings
of
the
coast
having
been
already
made
for
charts
which
are
preparing
under
the
orders
of
the
admiralty
about
the
year
a
great
mass
of
geographical
information
was
collected
on
the
continent
of
europe
and
lodged
in
the
british
museum
from
which
information
may
probably
be
derived
respecting
this
coast
when
that
collection
shall
have
been
arranged
and
submitted

public

the

in
some
places
a

assume
mozambique
as
prasum
by
which
classical
name
it
is
distinguished
in
the
lusiad
of
camoens
in
reference
to
the
voyage
of
de
gama
and
the
near
coincidence
of
situation
gives
great
probability
to
this
supposition
greek
prason
signifies
a
leek
and
is
also
used
to
denote
a
of
a
similar
green
colour
and
the
name
may
either
have
been
derived
from
the

from

than

ten

which
is
so
clear
that
every
bank

be
easily
seen
the
moors
so
often
mentioned
are
supposed
by
bruce
to
have
been
merchants
expelled
from
spain
by
ferdinand
and
isabella
who
first
fixed
their
residence
on
the
western
coast
of
africa
and
extending
themselves
eastwards
formed
settlements
in
arabia
and
egypt
till
the
oppressions
of
selim
and
soliman
the
turkish
emperors
interrupted
their
commerce
and
obliged
them
to
disperse
along
the
coast
of
abyssinia
and
eastern
africa
besides
the
impossibility
chronologically
for
the
assigned
causes
having
produced
the
supposed
effect
there
is
no
necessity
for
having
recourse
to
this
improbable
hypothesis
from
being
best
acquainted
with
their
moorish
conquerors
the
spaniards
and
portuguese
have
always
been
accustomed
to
name
all
the
arabians
moors
wherever
they
found
them
and
even
gave
at
first
the
name
of
moors
to
the
negroes
whence
our
old
english
term
it
is
well
known
that
the
arabs
especially
after
their
conversion
to
mahometanism
were
great
colonizers
or
conquerors
even
the
now
kingdom
of
abyssinia
was
an
early
colony
and
conquest
of
the
pagan
arabs
and
its
inhabitants
are
consequently
moors
in
the
most
extended
portuguese
sense
the
arab
or
moorish
kingdoms
along
the
african
coast
of
the
indian
ocean
are
branches
from
the
same
original
stem
and
the
early
mahometan
missionaries
were
both
zealous
and
successful
in
propagating
islaemism
among
the
most
distant
pagan
colonies
of
their
countrymen
as
all
zealous
mussulmen
are
enjoined
the
pilgrimage
of
mecca
and
commerce
mixes
largely
with
religion
in
the
holy
journey
by
which
the
faithful
from
every
distant
region
often
meet
at
mecca
and
induce
each
other
to
extend
their
commercial
adventures
to
new
regions
it
may
possibly
have
been
that
some
moors
originally
from
spain
may
even
have
reached
mozambique
before
the
time
of
de
gama
but
it
is
ridiculous
to
suppose
that
all
the
moors
on
the
african
coast
had
been
spaniards
the
overthrow
of
the
great
moorish
kingdom
of
granada
only
took
place
five
or
six
years
before
the
present
voyage
the
island
of
mozambique
which
does
not
exceed
a
league
in
circumference
is
described
as
low
and
swampy
and
was
inhabited
by
moors
who
had
come
from
quiloa
and
sofala
it
was
afterwards
much
resorted
to
by
the
portuguese
as
a
winter
station
and
became
the
key
of
their
indian
trade
the
african
coast
stretches
out
on
both
sides
of
the
island
into
two
points
that
on
the
called
pannoni
off
which
a
shoal
with
three
islets
extends
some
way
into
the
sea
the
southern
point
is
called
mangale
when
the
moorish
governor
of
mozambique
was
informed
of
the
arrival
of
the
portuguese
and
that
coello
was
come
to
anchor
in
the
harbour
he
fully
supposed
that
they
were
turks
or
moors
from
some
distant
place
and
immediately
came
to
visit
him
apparelled
in
fine
silk
with
many
attendants
coello
received
him
very
courteously
but
as
neither
he
nor
any
in
his
ship
could
speak
their
language
the
governor
soon
retired
coello
gave
him
however
a
red
cap
on
which
he
seemed
to
set
little
value
and
presented
him
likewise
with
some
black
beads
which
he
carried
away
in
his
hand
both
being
given
and
received
in
token
of
friendship
on
leaving
the
ship
he
required
coello
by
signs
to
let
him
have
the
boat
to
carry
him
on
shore
which
coello
readily
agreed
to
and
sent
some
of
his
men
to
the
land
along
with
him
these
the
governor
carried
to
his
house
and
feasted
them
on
dates
and
other
things
and
sent
back
with
them
a
pot
of
preserved
dates
to
coello
with
which
he
regaled
the
general
and
his
brother
when
they
had
entered
the
harbour
on
the
arrival
of
the
other
two
ships
the
governor
again
sent
off
some
of
his
people
to
visit
them
still
taking
them
for
turks
presenting
many
pleasant
and
delicate
viands
and
asking
permission
to
visit
them
in
person
the
general
in
return
sent
the
governor
a
present
consisting
of
red
hats
short
gowns
coral
brass
basons
hawks
bells
and
many
other
things
which
he
slighted
as
of
no
value
and
asked
why
the
general
had
not
sent
him
scarlet
which
he
chiefly
desired
soon
afterwards
the
governor
came
off
to
visit
the
general
who
being
apprized
of
his
coming
ordered
all
the
ships
to
be
dressed
out
in
their
flags
he
likewise
made
all
the
sick
and
infirm
men
to
be
kept
out
of
sight
and
brought
a
good
many
of
the
most
alert
men
from
the
other
ships
whom
he
ordered
to
be
secretly
armed
in
case
of
any
violence
or
treachery
on
the
part
of
the
moors
the
governor
came
on
board
accompanied
with
many
men
all
well
apparelled
in
silk
having
many
ivory
trumpets
and
other
musical
instruments
on
which
they
played
almost
without
ceasing
the
governor
was
a
lean
man
of
good
stature
dressed
in
a
linen
shirt
down
to
his
heels
over
which
he
wore
a
long
gown
of
mecca
velvet
having
a
cap
of
silk
of
many
colours
trimmed
with
gold
on
his
head
at
his
girdle
he
wore
a
sword
and
dagger
and
had
silk
shoes
the
general
received
him
on
entering
the
ship
and
led
him
to
an
awning
trimmed
up
in
the
best
manner
they
were
able
the
general
then
begged
him
not
to
be
offended
that
no
scarlet
had
been
sent
having
brought
none
with
him
and
that
his
ships
only
contained
such
merchandize
as
were
fit
to
be
bartered
for
victuals
for
the
people
and
that
his
only
object
at
present
was
to
discover
the
way
to
the
indies
for
which
purpose
he
had
been
sent
by
a
great
and
mighty
king
his
master
all
this
was
conveyed
through
the
interpretation
of
fernan
martin
the
general
then
ordered
an
entertainment
of
the
best
meats
and
wines
which
the
ship
afforded
to
be
set
before
the
governor
and
his
principal
attendants
of
all
which
they
partook
willingly
even
drinking
wine
with
good
will
the
governor
asked
whether
they
came
from
turkey
as
he
had
heard
say
that
the
turks
were
a
fair
people
like
them
and
desired
to
see
our
country
bows
and
the
books
of
our
law
to
this
the
general
answered
that
he
and
his
men
were
not
from
turkey
but
from
a
kingdom
in
their
neighbourhood
that
he
would
most
willingly
shew
his
bows
and
other
weapons
but
had
not
the
books
of
our
law
as
they
were
not
needed
at
sea
then
some
were
brought
which
were
bent
and
shot
off
in
presence
of
the
governor
also
some
of
our
harness
or
defensive
armour
with
all
of
which
he
was
much
pleased
and
greatly
astonished
during
this
conference
the
general
learnt
that
the
port
of
calicut
in
india
was
leagues
distant
from
mozambique
and
as
there
were
many
shoals
in
the
course
that
it
was
very
necessary
to
have
a
pilot
from
this
place
he
learned
also
that
there
were
many
cities
along
the
coast
he
likewise
understood
that
the
kingdom
of
prester
john
was
far
from
this
place
in
the
inland
country
considering
the
expediency
of
having
a
pilot
the
general
requested
to
have
two
from
the
governor
who
agreed
to
the
demand
on
condition
that
they
should
be
well
used
the
reason
of
wishing
to
have
two
was
lest
one
might
die
during
the
voyage
and
our
people
were
much
pleased
with
this
promise
the
governor
came
a
second
time
to
visit
the
general
and
brought
with
him
both
the
pilots
whom
he
had
promised
to
each
of
whom
were
given
thirty
crowns
and
a
coat
each
crown
being
worth
five
shillings
under
this
condition
that
whenever
one
of
them
should
go
on
shore
the
other
should
remain
on
board
that
one
might
always
stay
by
the
ship
while
in
harbour
notwithstanding
these
friendly
meetings
speeches
and
assurances
it
soon
appeared
after
the
departure
of
the
governor
that
the
moors
had
learned
during
their
intercourse
with
our
people
that
they
were
christians
on
which
the
former
friendship
and
good
will
of
the
moors
towards
them
was
changed
to
wrath
and
fury
and
they
henceforwards
used
every
endeavour
to
kill
our
men
and
to
take
possession
of
the
ships
the
governor
therefore
and
his
people
used
every
effort
for
this
mischievous
purpose
and
had
certainly
succeeded
if
the
almighty
had
not
moved
the
heart
of
one
of
the
moorish
pilots
who
had
been
received
into
the
portuguese
fleet
to
reveal
the
same
to
the
general
who
fearing
lest
the
infidels
might
suddenly
execute
their
purpose
as
being
numerous
in
comparison
to
his
small
company
determined
to
remain
no
longer
in
the
harbour
wherefore
on
saturday
the
march
being
seven
days
after
his
arrival
he
quitted
the
harbour
of
mozambique
and
cast
anchor
close
to
an
island
at
the
distance
of
a
league
from
that
place
intending
on
sunday
to
hear
mass
on
shore
that
they
might
confess
and
receive
the
sacrament
which
had
not
been
done
since
leaving
lisbon
after
the
ships
were
come
to
anchor
in
this
place
of
safety
from
being
burnt
by
the
moors
which
the
general
greatly
dreaded
he
determined
to
go
back
to
mozambique
in
his
boat
to
demand
the
other
pilot
who
had
been
promised
but
who
still
remained
on
shore
leaving
his
brother
with
the
fleet
in
readiness
to
come
to
his
aid
if
needful
the
general
went
towards
mozambique
with
his
boat
accompanied
by
nicholas
coello
and
the
moorish
pilot
on
their
way
they
saw
six
or
boats
filled
with
moors
coming
towards
them
armed
with
long
bows
and
arrows
and
also
with
shields
and
spears
the
moors
called
to
our
people
to
come
along
with
them
to
the
town
and
the
moorish
pilot
who
explained
their
signals
advised
the
general
to
do
so
as
the
governor
would
not
otherwise
deliver
the
other
pilot
who
still
remained
on
shore
the
general
was
much
displeased
at
this
advice
believing
the
pilot
only
wished
him
to
approach
the
shore
that
he
might
be
able
to
run
away
and
therefore
ordered
him
to
be
secured
as
a
prisoner
he
likewise
gave
orders
to
fire
at
the
moorish
boats
from
his
ordnance
when
paulo
de
la
gama
heard
the
shot
believing
the
general
to
be
in
more
danger
than
he
actually
was
he
immediately
came
with
the
ship
berrio
under
sail
to
his
aid
on
seeing
this
the
moors
fled
away
in
such
haste
that
the
general
could
not
overtake
them
and
therefore
returned
with
his
brother
to
where
the
other
ships
were
at
anchor
next
day
being
sunday
the
general
and
all
his
men
went
on
shore
where
they
heard
mass
and
received
the
sacrament
very
devoutly
having
confessed
the
evening
before
after
this
they
and
set
sail
the
same
day
having
no
hope
of
procuring
the
other
pilot
the
general
ordered
to
release
him
whom
he
had
confined
and
carried
him
on
the
voyage
but
he
willing
to
be
revenged
for
the
indignity
he
had
experienced
determined
on
carrying
the
portuguese
fleet
to
the
island
of
quiloa
which
was
all
peopled
with
moors
and
as
it
seemed
intended
to
inform
the
king
of
that
place
that
our
ships
belonged
to
the
christians
that
he
might
destroy
them
and
kill
the
crews
for
this
purpose
he
craftily
persuaded
the
general
not
to
be
in
trouble
for
want
of
the
other
pilot
as
he
would
carry
him
to
a
great
island
on
hundred
leagues
from
thence
which
was
inhabited
half
by
moors
and
half
by
christians
who
were
always
in
war
with
each
other
and
where
he
might
easily
find
pilots
to
conduct
him
to
calicut
though
the
general
was
much
pleased
with
this
information
he
yet
did
not
give
implicit
credit
to
the
moor
but
promised
him
high
rewards
if
he
carried
him
in
safety
to
that
country
and
so
went
forward
on
the
voyage
with
a
scant
wind
on
the
tuesday
the
fleet
was
still
in
sight
of
the
land
from
which
they
took
their
departure
and
remained
becalmed
all
that
day
and
the
next
on
wednesday
night
a
gentle
breeze
sprung
up
from
the
eastward
on
which
the
fleet
stood
off
to
seaward
but
on
thursday
morning
on
again
making
the
land
they
were
four
leagues
to
leeward
of
mozambique
whence
plying
to
windward
they
came
back
that
evening
to
the
island
where
they
had
heard
mass
on
the
sunday
before
where
they
cast
anchor
and
remained
eight
days
waiting
for
a
fair
wind
while
here
at
anchor
a
white
moor
who
was
a
or
minister
among
the
moors
of
mozambique
came
on
board
the
generals
ship
representing
that
the
governor
was
much
grieved
at
the
breach
of
peace
and
friendship
between
them
which
he
would
now
gladly
renew
to
this
the
general
made
answer
that
he
would
make
no
peace
with
the
governor
unless
he
sent
him
the
other
pilot
whom
he
had
hired
and
paid
with
this
answer
the
departed
and
never
came
back
after
this
while
still
waiting
for
a
fair
wind
there
came
another
moor
on
board
accompanied
with
his
son
a
boy
and
asked
the
general
to
give
him
a
passage
to
the
city
of
melinda
which
he
said
was
on
his
way
to
calicut
he
said
that
he
was
a
native
of
the
country
near
mecca
whence
he
had
piloted
a
ship
to
mozambique
and
would
gladly
go
with
him
that
he
might
return
to
his
own
country
and
farther
he
counselled
the
general
not
to
remain
in
expectation
of
any
answer
from
the
who
he
was
sure
would
make
no
peace
with
him
on
account
of
his
hatred
to
the
christians
the
general
was
rejoiced
at
the
coming
of
this
moor
expecting
to
acquire
information
from
him
concerning
the
straits
of
the
red
sea
and
of
the
towns
on
the
coast
between
mozambique
and
melinda
by
which
he
had
to
sail
and
therefore
gave
orders
to
receive
this
moor
and
his
son
on
board
as
the
ships
were
rather
short
of
water
the
general
and
the
other
captains
determined
upon
entering
the
harbour
of
mozambique
to
take
in
what
they
needed
but
ordered
strict
watch
to
be
kept
lest
the
moors
should
set
the
ships
on
fire
they
entered
therefore
again
into
the
harbour
on
thursday
and
when
night
came
they
went
in
their
boats
in
search
of
water
which
the
moorish
pilot
assured
them
was
to
be
found
on
the
firm
land
and
offered
to
guide
them
to
the
place
leaving
paulo
de
la
gama
in
charge
of
the
ships
and
taking
nicholas
coello
and
the
pilot
along
with
him
in
the
boats
the
general
went
on
shore
about
midnight
to
the
place
where
the
pilot
said
that
water
was
to
be
had
but
it
could
not
be
found
whether
that
the
pilot
misled
them
in
hope
of
escaping
or
finding
he
could
not
escape
did
so
out
of
malice
having
spent
the
whole
night
fruitlessly
in
search
of
water
and
day
beginning
to
dawn
the
general
returned
to
the
ships
for
more
force
lest
the
moors
might
set
upon
him
and
his
small
company
at
a
disadvantage
having
furnished
his
boats
with
a
larger
force
of
armed
men
he
returned
to
the
shore
still
accompanied
by
coello
and
the
moorish
pilot
who
seeing
no
means
of
escaping
now
pointed
out
the
close
by
the
shore
at
this
place
they
observed
about
twenty
moors
armed
with
darts
who
shewed
as
if
they
meant
to
prevent
them
from
taking
water
the
general
therefore
gave
orders
to
fire
three
guns
to
force
them
from
the
shore
that
our
men
might
be
able
to
land
unopposed
amazed
and
frightened
by
the
noise
and
the
effect
of
the
shot
the
moors
ran
away
and
hid
themselves
in
the
bushes
and
our
people
landed
quietly
and
took
in
fresh
water
returning
to
the
ships
a
little
before
sunset
on
arriving
the
general
found
his
brother
much
disquieted
because
a
negro
belonging
to
john
cambrayes
the
pilot
of
paulo
de
la
gama
had
run
away
to
the
moors
though
himself
a
christian
upon
saturday
the
of
march
being
the
eve
of
the
annunciation
of
our
lady
a
moor
appeared
early
in
the
morning
on
the
shore
abreast
of
the
ships
calling
out
in
a
loud
and
shrill
voice
that
if
our
men
wanted
any
more
water
they
might
now
come
for
it
when
they
would
find
such
as
were
ready
to
force
their
return
irritated
at
this
bravado
and
remembering
the
injury
done
him
in
withholding
the
promised
pilot
and
the
loss
of
the
negro
the
general
resolved
to
batter
the
town
with
his
ordnance
in
revenge
and
the
other
captains
readily
agreed
to
the
measure
wherefore
they
armed
all
their
boats
and
came
up
before
the
town
where
the
moors
had
constructed
a
barricade
of
boards
for
their
defence
on
the
shore
so
thick
that
our
men
could
not
see
the
moors
behind
upon
the
shore
between
that
defence
and
the
sea
an
hundred
moors
were
drawn
up
armed
with
targets
darts
bows
arrows
and
slings
who
began
to
sling
stones
at
the
boats
as
soon
as
they
came
within
reach
they
were
immediately
answered
with
shot
from
our
ordnance
on
which
they
retired
from
the
shore
behind
their
barricade
which
was
soon
beaten
down
when
they
ran
into
the
town
leaving
two
of
their
men
slain
the
general
and
his
men
now
returned
to
the
ships
to
dinner
and
the
moors
were
seen
running
from
that
town
to
another
and
so
much
were
they
afraid
of
the
portuguese
that
they
abandoned
the
island
going
by
water
to
another
place
on
the
opposite
side
after
dinner
our
people
went
with
their
captains
on
shore
to
endeavour
to
take
some
of
the
moors
with
the
hope
of
procuring
restitution
of
the
negro
belonging
to
cambrayes
who
had
run
away
from
the
ships
and
they
were
likewise
desirous
of
recovering
two
indians
who
were
said
by
the
moorish
pilot
to
be
detained
as
captives
in
mozambique
on
this
occasion
paulo
de
la
gama
seized
four
moors
who
were
in
a
boat
but
a
great
many
moors
in
other
boats
escaped
by
hastening
on
shore
and
leaving
their
boats
behind
in
which
our
men
found
much
cotton
cloth
and
several
books
of
their
mahometan
law
which
the
general
ordered
to
be
preserved
the
general
and
the
other
captains
ranged
in
their
boats
along
side
of
the
town
but
did
not
venture
on
shore
not
having
sufficient
force
nor
could
they
get
any
speech
of
the
moors
next
day
they
went
on
shore
at
the
where
they
took
what
was
needed
without
any
opposition
from
the
moors
being
now
hopeless
of
recovering
the
negro
or
of
procuring
the
indian
captives
it
was
determined
to
depart
but
the
general
resolved
to
be
revenged
on
the
town
and
people
for
their
enmity
for
which
reason
he
went
against
it
next
day
with
ordnance
and
destroyed
it
in
such
sort
that
the
moors
had
to
abandon
it
and
flee
into
another
island
within
the
country
this
being
done
the
fleet
weighed
anchor
on
tuesday
the
of
march
and
departed
from
mozambique
whence
they
proceeded
to
two
little
rocks
which
they
called
st
george
and
where
they
came
to
anchor
in
waiting
for
a
wind
which
was
now
contrary
soon
afterwards
the
wind
came
fair
and
they
departed
but
the
wind
was
so
light
and
the
currents
so
strong
that
they
were
forced
in
a
retrograde
course
the
general
was
much
pleased
to
find
that
one
of
the
moors
taken
by
his
brother
at
mozambique
was
a
pilot
and
was
acquainted
with
the
navigation
to
calicut
proceeding
on
their
voyage
they
came
on
sunday
the
first
of
april
to
certain
islands
very
near
the
coast
to
the
first
of
which
they
gave
the
name
of
da
because
the
moorish
pilot
of
mozambique
was
here
severely
whipt
by
order
of
the
general
for
having
falsely
said
that
these
islands
were
part
of
the
continent
and
likewise
for
not
shewing
the
way
to
the
at
mozambique
as
before
related
being
cruelly
whipt
the
moor
confessed
that
he
had
brought
them
to
this
place
expressly
that
they
might
perish
on
the
rocks
and
shoals
of
these
islands
which
were
so
numerous
and
so
close
together
that
they
could
hardly
be
distinguished
from
each
other
on
this
the
general
stood
out
to
sea
and
on
friday
the
of
april
standing
to
the
west
he
came
in
sight
before
noon
of
a
great
land
with
two
islands
near
the
coast
around
which
were
many
shoals
on
nearing
the
shore
the
moorish
pilots
recognized
it
and
said
that
the
christian
island
of
quiloa
was
three
leagues
astern
on
which
the
general
was
much
grieved
believing
certainly
that
the
natives
of
quiloa
had
been
christians
as
represented
by
the
pilots
and
that
they
had
purposely
taken
a
wrong
course
that
the
ships
might
not
come
there
the
pilots
to
conceal
their
treachery
alleged
that
the
winds
and
currents
had
carried
the
ships
farther
than
they
reckoned
but
in
truth
they
were
more
disappointed
in
this
than
even
the
general
as
they
had
reckoned
upon
being
here
revenged
upon
the
portuguese
by
having
them
all
slain
in
this
god
preserved
our
people
from
the
intended
danger
most
miraculously
for
if
they
had
gone
to
quiloa
they
had
all
surely
perished
as
the
general
was
so
fully
persuaded
of
the
natives
being
christians
as
reported
by
the
pilot
that
he
would
doubtless
have
landed
immediately
on
his
arrival
and
have
thereby
run
headlong
to
a
place
where
he
and
all
his
people
would
have
been
slain
both
parties
being
thus
sorry
for
having
missed
quiloa
the
general
because
he
hoped
to
have
found
christians
and
the
moorish
pilots
because
of
their
intended
treachery
it
was
determined
to
put
back
with
the
intention
of
seeking
for
it
but
still
the
wind
and
currents
opposed
their
purpose
and
they
tried
a
whole
day
in
vain
this
doubtless
proceeded
from
the
providence
of
god
and
his
merciful
goodness
to
our
men
who
were
thus
preserved
by
miracle
from
the
malicious
and
devilish
intentions
of
the
two
moorish
pilots
of
mozambique
the
fleet
being
thus
baffled
and
tossed
to
and
fro
it
was
determined
to
bear
away
for
the
island
of
mombaza
in
which
the
pilots
said
there
were
two
towns
peopled
both
by
moors
and
christians
but
they
gave
out
this
as
before
to
deceive
our
people
and
to
lead
them
to
destruction
for
that
island
was
solely
inhabited
by
moors
as
is
the
whole
of
that
coast
understanding
that
mombaza
was
seventy
miles
distant
they
bore
away
for
that
place
and
towards
evening
they
came
in
sight
of
a
great
island
towards
the
north
in
which
the
moorish
pilots
pretended
there
were
two
towns
one
of
christians
and
the
other
of
moors
making
this
false
assertion
to
make
our
people
believe
that
there
were
many
christians
on
this
coast
while
pursuing
their
voyage
towards
mombaza
for
some
days
the
ship
san
raphael
chanced
one
morning
two
hours
before
day
to
get
aground
on
certain
shoals
two
leagues
from
the
shore
of
the
continent
paulo
de
gama
immediately
made
signals
to
apprize
the
other
ships
of
his
situation
and
their
danger
on
which
they
had
the
good
fortune
to
avoid
the
shoals
and
got
safely
to
anchor
the
boats
from
the
other
ships
were
immediately
sent
off
to
assist
paulo
de
gama
in
the
st
raphael
and
on
seeing
that
the
tide
was
then
low
the
general
was
much
rejoiced
as
he
well
knew
she
would
float
again
with
the
tide
of
flood
whereas
before
he
was
much
afraid
she
might
be
totally
lost
he
therefore
gave
orders
to
carry
all
their
anchors
out
to
deep
water
to
prevent
her
from
getting
farther
on
the
shoal
by
the
time
this
was
done
day
broke
and
soon
after
at
low
water
the
st
raphael
was
quite
dry
on
a
sand
bank
having
taken
no
harm
in
striking
while
waiting
for
the
tide
of
flood
our
people
named
these
sands
baixos
de
sam
or
the
shoals
of
st
raphael
and
named
certain
islands
and
hills
of
the
continent
then
in
sight
the
islands
and
hills
of
st
raphael
while
the
ship
remained
thus
dry
and
the
people
walking
about
on
the
sand
they
saw
two
boats
full
of
moors
who
came
to
our
ships
bringing
many
sweet
oranges
much
better
than
those
of
portugal
these
men
told
the
general
not
to
fear
any
damage
to
the
ship
which
was
aground
as
she
would
float
uninjured
with
the
next
flood
and
the
general
was
so
much
pleased
with
this
good
heartening
that
he
gave
them
several
presents
which
they
accepted
with
many
thanks
and
understanding
that
our
fleet
intended
to
put
in
at
mombaza
they
requested
to
be
carried
thither
the
general
granted
their
request
and
permitted
them
to
remain
on
board
the
others
returning
from
our
ships
to
their
own
country
when
it
was
full
sea
the
st
raphael
floated
and
got
off
the
shoal
and
the
fleet
proceeded
on
its
voyage
following
the
coast
to
the
the
fleet
came
to
anchor
outside
of
the
bar
of
the
harbour
of
mombaza
about
sunset
of
saturday
the
of
april
mombaza
is
on
an

island
there
is
a
city
having
the
same
name
momabza
standing
in
lat
which
is
handsomely
built
on
a
rocky
hill
washed
by
the
sea
the
entrance
of
the
haven

is
good

much
frequented
by
shipping
and
it
receives
from
the
african
continent
in
its
neighbourhood
great
quantities
of
honey
wax
and
ivory
the
general
did
not
enter
the
harbour
that
night
because
it
grew
late
but
commanded
to
hoist
the
flags
in
compliment
which
the
people
did
with
much
mirth
and
joy
in
hope
that
they
had
come
to
an
island
in
which
there
were
many
christians
and
that
next
day
they
might
hear
mass
on
shore
they
had
likewise
great
hope
that
the
sick
who
were
almost
the
whole
crews
might
here
recover
their
health
though
indeed
they
were
much
reduced
in
number
many
having
died
during
the
voyage
soon
after
our
ships
came
to
anchor
although
night
approached
a
large
boat
containing
about
a
hundred
men
all
armed
with
swords
and
targets
was
seen
coming
towards
the
fleet
on
reaching
the
generals
ship
they
would
have
all
come
on
board
with
their
weapons
but
the
general
only
permitted
four
of
their
principals
to
come
aboard
and
even
they
unarmed
causing
them
to
be
told
in
their
own
language
that
they
must
excuse
his
precaution
being
a
stranger
and
not
knowing
therefore
whom
he
might
trust
to
those
whom
he
permitted
to
come
on
board
he
gave
courteous
entertainment
presenting
them
with
such
conserves
as
he
had
of
which
they
readily
partook
and
he
requested
of
them
not
to
take
ill
that
he
had
thus
refused
entrance
to
so
many
armed
men
they
said
that
they
had
merely
come
to
see
him
as
a
new
and
rare
thing
in
their
country
and
that
their
being
armed
was
merely
because
such
was
the
custom
of
the
country
whether
in
peace
or
war
they
also
said
that
the
king
of
mombaza
expected
his
arrival
and
would
have
sent
to
visit
him
if
it
had
not
been
so
late
but
certainly
would
do
so
next
day
their
king
they
added
was
rejoiced
at
his
arrival
and
would
not
only
be
glad
to
see
him
but
would
load
his
ships
with
spices
they
also
said
that
there
were
many
christians
on
the
island
who
lived
by
themselves
at
which
the
general
was
much
pleased
believing
their
story
which
agreed
with
what
the
two
pilots
had
said
yet
he
entertained
some
jealous
doubts
for
all
their
fair
speeches
and
wisely
suspected
the
moors
had
come
to
see
if
they
could
lay
a
train
to
take
our
ships
in
this
he
was
perfectly
right
as
it
afterwards
appeared
that
this
was
their
sole
intent
the
king
of
mombaza
had
received
perfect
intelligence
that
we
were
christians
and
of
all
that
we
had
done
at
mozambique
and
plotted
to
be
revenged
by
taking
our
ships
and
killing
our
men
next
day
being
palm
sunday
still
prosecuting
his
wicked
purpose
the
king
sent
some
white
moors
with
a
message
to
the
general
declaring
his
great
joy
at
our
arrival
inviting
him
into
the
harbour
and
engaging
to
supply
him
with
all
things
he
might
be
in
need
of
and
in
token
of
amity
sent
him
a
ring
a
sheep
and
many
sweet
oranges
citrons
and
sugar
canes
these
white
moors
were
likewise
instructed
to
pretend
that
they
were
christians
and
that
there
were
many
christians
in
the
island
all
this
was
so
well
counterfeited
that
our
people
actually
believed
them
to
be
christians
on
which
account
the
general
received
them
with
much
courtesy
and
made
them
some
presents
sending
a
message
to
the
king
that
he
would
certainly
come
farther
into
the
harbour
next
day
he
also
sent
a
present
to
the
king
of
a
fine
branch
of
coral
and
for
the
greater
security
he
sent
along
with
these
white
moors
two
of
our
banished
men
who
had
been
embarked
expressly
for
such
hazardous
undertakings
or
for
being
left
on
shore
where
it
might
be
deemed
expedient
to
become
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
of
various
places
and
to
be
taken
on
board
again
these
men
and
the
moors
who
had
been
on
board
were
met
in
landing
by
a
number
of
people
curious
to
see
and
examine
them
who
accompanied
them
all
the
way
to
the
kings
palace
where
they
had
to
pass
through
three
several
doors
each
guarded
by
an
armed
porter
before
they
came
to
the
place
where
the
king
was
they
found
the
king
in
no
very
great
state
yet
he
received
them
well
and
commanded
the
moors
who
had
brought
them
on
shore
to
show
them
the
city
in
going
through
the
streets
our
men
saw
many
prisoners
in
irons
but
not
knowing
the
language
they
could
not
ask
who
or
what
these
were
yet
believed
they
might
be
christians
us
our
general
was
informed
by
the
moorish
pilots
and
the
kings
two
messengers
that
there
were
christians
on
the
island
and
that
the
christians
and
the
moors
had
wars
together
our
men
were
likewise
carried
to
the
house
in
which
the
merchants
of
india
dwelt
who
were
said
to
be
christians
these
people
learning
that
our
men
were
christians
shewed
much
joy
at
receiving
them
embracing
and
banqueting
them
and
shewed
them
a
piece
of
paper
on
which
the
figure
of
the
holy
ghost
was
painted
which
they
worshipped
on
their
knees
with
great
shew
of
devotion
as
if
they
had
been
what
they
pretended
the
moors
then
informed
our
men
by
signs
that
there
were
many
other
christians
at
another
place
too
far
for
carrying
them
there
but
that
they
should
be
conducted
to
see
them
when
our
ships
came
into
the
harbour
all
this
was
done
craftily
to
entice
our
people
into
the
harbour
where
they
were
determined
to
destroy
them
all
after
our
two
men
had
seen
the
city
they
were
conducted
back
to
the
king
who
ordered
them
to
be
shewn
ginger
pepper
cloves
and
wheat
giving
them
samples
of
them
all
to
be
carried
to
the
general
with
assurance
that
he
had
great
store
of
all
these
commodities
and
would
give
him
his
loading
if
he
desired
it
they
were
likewise
told
that
he
had
great
plenty
of
gold
silver
amber
wax
ivory
and
other
riches
which
he
would
sell
at
lower
prices
than
they
could
be
bought
in
any
other
place
this
message
was
brought
off
on
monday
to
the
general
who
hearing
the
kings
offer
to
furnish
him
with
a
loading
of
these
commodities
was
much
rejoiced
and
was
much
pleased
with
the
information
brought
by
the
two
convicts
and
their
good
report
of
the
people
city
and
country
and
more
especially
on
account
of
the
christians
whom
they
had
seen
in
the
house
of
the
indian
merchants
after
a
consultation
with
the
other
captains
it
was
determined
to
enter
the
port
next
day
and
to
accept
the
spices
offered
by
the
king
of
mambaza
after
which
to
continue
the
voyage
to
calicut
and
if
they
could
not
procure
similar
articles
there
to
return
contented
with
what
might
be
got
in
this
place
in
the
meantime
several
of
the
moors
visited
our
ships
conducting
themselves
with
much
gentleness
and
humility
and
evincing
an
appearance
of
friendship
and
kindness
to
our
people
as
if
they
had
been
long
and
familiarly
acquainted
when
the
tide
of
flood
was
sufficiently
advanced
on
the
following
morning
the
general
gave
orders
to
weigh
anchor
intending
to
carry
the
ships
into
the
harbour
but
the
almighty
disposer
of
events
not
willing
that
he
and
his
company
should
fall
into
the
snare
which
the
moors
had
laid
for
their
destruction
interposed
to
avert
the
danger
and
to
work
their
safety
for
when
the
generals
ship
had
weighed
anchor
and
was
about
to
enter
the
port
she
touched
on
a
shoal
by
the
stern
upon
which
he
immediately
let
fall
his
anchor
again
which
was
likewise
done
by
the
other
captains
seeing
this
the
moors
who
were
on
board
concluded
that
he
would
not
enter
the
harbour
that
day
and
instantly
took
to
their
boat
which
was
alongside
and
made
for
the
city
at
the
same
time
the
pilot
of
mozambique
leapt
from
the
stern
of
the
admirals
ship
into
the
water
and
was
taken
into
the
boat
by
the
moors
the
admiral
called
out
to
them
to
bring
him
back
but
all
in
vain
on
which
he
began
to
suspect
that
the
moors
and
their
king
had
evil
intentions
towards
him
and
his
people
and
was
thankful
for
the
accident
which
had
detained
him
from
the
harbour
and
preserved
him
from
the
purposed
treachery
after
explaining
his
apprehensions
to
the
other
captains
he
commanded
in
the
evening
of
this
day
that
two
of
the
moors
who
had
been
made
prisoners
at
mozambique
should
be
put
to
the
torture
to
endeavour
to
ascertain
whether
any
treachery
was
intended
and
to
force
them
to
disclose
the
same
this
was
done
by
dropping
melted
bacon
upon
their
flesh
and
they
immediately
confessed
that
treason
was
intended
and
that
the
pilots
had
escaped
by
swimming
from
the
ship
as
fearing
the
same
had
been
discovered
on
this
confession
the
general
resolved
on
no
account
to
enter
the
harbour
yet
determined
to
put
another
moor
to
the
torture
to
learn
if
he
were
in
confederacy
with
the
rest
but
this
moor
on
seeing
preparations
made
for
the
purpose
although
his
hands
were
bound
leapt
into
the
sea
which
was
likewise
done
by
another
moor
before
having
thus
discovered
the
secret
mischiefs
which
had
been
prepared
against
him
the
general
gave
thanks
to
god
by
whose
good
providence
he
and
his
people
had
been
delivered
from
imminent
hazard
of
death
among
the
infidels
whereupon
he
and
his
company
joined
in
the
with
great
devotion
after
this
lest
the
moors
might
attempt
any
thing
against
their
safety
during
the
night
he
ordered
a
strong
and
vigilant
armed
watch
to
be
kept
it
is
worthy
of
notice
that
all
the
sick
among
our
people
who
were
indeed
many
began
presently
to
get
well
from
their
first
coming
to
mombaza
so
that
in
this
time
of
their
great
necessity
and
danger
they
found
themselves
sound
and
strong
beyond
all
human
hope
and
far
above
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
for
which
reason
it
can
only
be
attributed
to
the
marvellous
and
supernatural
power
of
god
miraculously
done
at
this
peculiar
instant
time
of
need
for
the
preservation
of
these
poor
and
distressed
persons
whose
only
hope
of
safety
was
in
him
after
the
night
watch
was
set
those
of
the
berrio
felt
the
cable
by
which
they
lay
at
anchor
swagging
as
if
shaken
by
a
great
tunny
of
which
there
were
many
in
this
place
very
large
and
excellent
food
but
on
giving
more
attention
to
the
circumstance
they
perceived
that
this
was
occasioned
by
their
enemies
the
moors
some
of
whom
were
swimming
about
the
cable
and
were
cutting
it
with
knives
or
falchions
that
the
ship
might
drift
on
shore
and
fall
a
prey
to
them
on
seeing
this
our
men
scared
them
away
by
crying
out
and
gave
notice
to
the
other
ships
to
be
on
their
guard
against
similar
attempts
some
people
from
the
san
raphael
went
immediately
to
the
assistance
of
the
berrio
and
found
some
of
the
moors
about
the
chains
and
tacklings
of
the
foremast
who
cast
themselves
into
the
sea
and
swam
along
with
those
who
had
attempted
to
cut
the
cable
to
certain
boats
that
were
in
waiting
at
a
short
distance
in
which
as
our
people
afterwards
learnt
there
were
a
great
number
of
the
moors
who
now
rowed
away
to
the
city
in
all
haste
our
fleet
still
remained
off
the
harbour
of
mombaza
all
the
wednesday
and
thursday
following
during
both
of
which
nights
the
moors
came
off
in
boats
which
always
lay
close
by
the
shore
whence
some
of
them
swam
to
the
ships
endeavouring
to
cut
our
cables
but
our
men
kept
such
strict
watch
that
they
were
unable
to
succeed
our
people
however
were
always
in
much
fear
and
perplexity
lest
the
moors
might
burn
our
ships
and
it
was
wonderful
they
did
not
make
the
attempt
by
means
of
the
ships
they
had
in
the
harbour
which
in
all
human
probability
they
had
succeeded
in
killing
and
destroying
us
all
it
was
conjectured
that
they
were
deterred
from
making
this
attempt
from
fear
of
the
ordnance
in
our
ships
but
whatever
might
appear
to
us
as
the
cause
of
their
not
using
open
force
it
was
assuredly
the
good
pleasure
and
favour
of
god
that
put
their
hearts
in
fear
against
making
an
open
attack
by
which
we
were
preserved
from
the
execution
of
their
cruel
purposes
towards
us
the
reason
of
the
general
remaining
during
the
two
days
off
mombaza
was
that
he
might
endeavour
to
procure
two
pilots
from
thence
to
carry
him
to
calicut
without
which
assistance
the
voyage
would
have
been
very
difficult
as
our
pilots
had
no
knowledge
of
that
country
but
finding
none
were
to
be
had
he
took
his
departure
from
that
place
on
friday
morning
though
with
a
very
light
wind
on
leaving
the
anchorage
he
was
forced
to
leave
one
of
his
anchors
behind
as
the
crew
was
so
completely
exhausted
by
hauling
up
the
rest
that
they
were
unable
to
weigh
this
one
it
was
afterwards
found
by
the
moors
and
carried
into
their
city
where
it
was
deposited
near
the
kings
palace
when
don
francisco
de
almeida
first
viceroy
of
the
indies
took
this
place
from
the
moors
this
anchor
was
there
found
as
i
shall
afterwards
relate
in
the
second
book
of
this
work
departing
thus
from
mombaza
the
fleet
continued
its
voyage
along
the
coast
to
the
and
having
very
light
wind
was
obliged
to
come
to
anchor
in
the
evening
near
the
shore
about
eight
leagues
from
mombaza
towards
the
dawn
of
next
day
two
sambuccos
or
little
pinnaces
were
seen
about
three
leagues
to
the
leeward
of
the
fleet
and
out
at
sea
on
which
in
hope
of
procuring
some
pilots
who
could
carry
him
to
calicut
the
general
ordered
the
anchors
to
be
weighed
and
he
and
the
other
captains
gave
chase
to
the
sambuccos
the
whole
of
that
day
towards
vespers
the
general
came
up
with
and
captured
one
of
these
pinnaces
but
the
other
escaped
to
the
land
in
the
captured
pinnace
there
were
seventeen
moors
among
whom
was
an
old
man
who
seemed
master
over
the
rest
and
had
his
young
wife
along
with
him
in
this
boat
there
was
great
store
of
silver
and
gold
and
some
victuals
on
the
same
evening
the
fleet
came
to
anchor
off
melinda
which
is
eighteen
leagues
from
mombaza
and
is
in
lat
this
place
has
no
good
harbour
being
only
an
almost
open
roadstead
having
a
kind
of
natural
pier
or
reef
of
rocks
on
which
the
sea
beats
with
much
violence
owing
to
which
the
ships
have

horsemen

commodities
the

exchange
with
the
merchants
of
cambaya
for
copper
quicksilver
and
cotton
cloth
to
the
profit
and
advantage
of
both
parties
the
king
of
this
city
is
a
moor
who
is
served
with
far
more
state
than
any
of
the
kings
on
this
coast
to
the
southwards
being
arrived
over
against
this
city
the
general
and
all
the
people
of
the
fleet
were
much
rejoiced
at
seeing
a
city
resembling
those
of
portugal
and
gave
thanks
to
god
for
their
safe
arrival
being
desirous
of
procuring
pilots
to
navigate
the
fleet
to
calicut
the
general
commanded
to
come
to
anchor
meaning
to
use
his
endeavours
for
this
purpose
for
hitherto
he
could
not
learn
from
the
moors
he
had
lately
captured
whether
any
of
them
were
pilots
and
though
he
had
threatened
them
with
the
torture
they
always
persisted
in
declaring
that
none
of
them
had
any
skill
in
pilotage
next
day
being
easter
eve
the
old
moor
who
had
been
made
prisoner
in
the
pinnace
told
the
general
that
there
were
four
ships
belonging
to
christians
of
the
indies
at
melinda
and
engaged
if
the
general
would
allow
him
and
the
other
moors
to
go
on
shore
he
would
provide
him
as
his
ransom
christian
pilots
and
would
farther
supply
him
with
every
thing
he
might
need
well
pleased
with
the
speeches
of
the
old
moor
the
general
removed
his
ships
to
within
half
a
league
of
the
city
whence
hitherto
no
one
came
off
to
our
fleet
as
they
feared
our
men
might
make
them
prisoners
for
they
had
received
intelligence
that
we
were
christians
and
believed
our
ships
were
men
of
war
on
the
monday
morning
therefore
the
general
commanded
the
old
moor
to
be
landed
on
a
ledge
or
rock
opposite
the
city
and
left
there
expecting
they
would
send
from
the
city
to
fetch
him
off
which
they
did
accordingly
as
soon
as
our
boat
departed
the
moor
was
carried
directly
to
the
king
to
whom
he
said
as
instructed
by
the
general
what
he
chiefly
desired
to
have
he
farther
said
that
the
general
desired
to
have
amity
with
the
king
of
whom
he
had
heard
a
good
report
hoping
by
his
aid
and
with
the
will
of
god
he
might
be
enabled
to
discover
the
route
to
india
the
king
received
this
message
favourably
and
sent
back
the
moor
in
a
boat
to
the
general
accompanied
by
one
of
his
own
servants
and
a
priest
saying
that
he
would
most
willingly
conclude
a
treaty
of
amity
with
him
and
should
supply
him
with
what
pilots
he
needed
these
messengers
likewise
presented
the
general
from
the
king
with
three
sheep
and
a
great
many
oranges
and
sugar
canes
which
he
thankfully
accepted
desiring
the
messengers
to
acquaint
their
master
that
he
gladly
agreed
to
the
profered
amity
and
was
ready
to
confirm
the
same
between
them
and
promised
to
enter
their
harbour
next
day
he
farther
desired
them
to
inform
the
king
that
he
was
the
subject
of
a
great
and
powerful
sovereign
in
the
west
who
had
sent
him
to
discover
the
way
to
calicut
with
orders
to
enter
into
peace
and
amity
with
all
kings
and
princes
on
whose
territories
he
might
happen
to
touch
by
the
way
that
it
was
now
since
he
left
his
own
country
and
that
the
king
his
master
was
a
prince
of
such
puissance
and
worth
as
he
was
convinced
the
king
of
melinda
would
be
glad
to
have
for
a
friend
he
then
dismissed
the
messengers
sending
as
a
present
to
their
king
a
hat
of
the
fashion
of
the
time
two
branches
of
coral
three
brass
basons
two
scarfs
and
some
small
bells
on
the
second
day
after
easter
the
general
removed
his
ships
nearer
the
city
the
king
knowing
this
and
believing
that
the
king
of
portugal
must
be
a
prince
and
the
general
a
worthy
subject
who
had
hazarded
himself
in
so
long
and
dangerous
a
voyage
became
desirous
of
seeing
such
men
wherefore
he
sent
a
more
honourable
message
to
the
general
saying
that
he
proposed
next
day
to
visit
him
in
person
intending
that
their
meeting
should
be
on
the
water
and
sent
him
a
present
of
six
sheep
with
a
considerable
quantity
of
cloves
ginger
pepper
and
nutmegs
upon
this
message
the
general
removed
his
fleet
still
nearer
the
city
and
came
to
anchor
close
to
the
four
ships
of
the
indies
of
which
the
old
moor
had
made
mention
as
belonging
to
christians
when
the
owners
of
these
ships
learnt
that
we
were
christians
they
came
immediately
to
visit
our
general
who
happened
then
to
be
in
the
ship
of
paulo
de
la
gama
these
men
were
of
a
brown
colour
but
of
good
stature
and
well
proportioned
dressed
in
long
white
cotton
gowns
having
large
beards
and
the
hair
of
their
heads
long
like
women
and
plaited
up
under
their
turbans
or
the
general
received
them
with
much
kindness
and
attention
asking
by
means
of
an
interpreter
who
understood
the
language
of
algarve
or
arabic
whether
they
were
christians
these
men
had
some
knowledge
of
that
language
though
it
was
not
their
own
tongue
but
had
learnt
it
in
the
course
of
their
trade
and
conversation
with
the
moors
of
melinda
of
whom
they
advised
the
general
to
beware
lest
their
inward
intentions
might
be
far
different
from
their
outward
shew
willing
to
make
trial
if
these
men
were
really
christians
the
general
caused
a
picture
to
be
shewn
them
on
which
our
lady
was
painted
weeping
surrounded
by
some
of
the
apostles
but
without
informing
them
what
this
was
meant
to
represent
immediately
on
this
being
set
before
them
they
fell
down
and
worshipped
the
picture
praying
for
some
time
the
general
then
asked
if
they
were
of
calicut
on
which
they
answered
they
were
of
grangalor
still
farther
off
and
could
give
him
no
information
respecting
calicut
from
this
time
so
long
as
our
fleet
remained
at
melinda
these
people
came
every
day
on
board
the
ship
of
paulo
de
la
gama
to
pay
their
devotions
before
this
picture
offering
to
the
images
which
it
represented
gifts
of
pepper
and
other
things
these
indian
christians
according
to
their
own
account
eat
no
beef
on
the
last
day
of
the
week
after
easter
and
in
the
afternoon
the
king
of
melinda
came
off
in
a
great
boat
to
our
fleet
he
was
dressed
in
a
cassock
of
crimson
damask
lined
with
green
satin
and
wore
a
rich
cloth
or
turban
on
his
head
he
sat
in
a
chair
of
the
ancient
fashion
very
well
made
and
wrought
with
wire
having
a
silk
cushion
and
on
another
chair
beside
him
there
lay
a
hat
of
crimson
satin
an
old
man
stood
by
him
as
his
page
who
carried
a
very
rich
sword
with
a
silver
scabbard
in
the
boat
there
were
many
sacbuts
and
two
ivory
flutes
eight
spans
long
on
which
they
played
by
a
little
hole
in
the
middle
agreeing
and
according
well
with
the
music
of
the
sacbuts
the
king
was
likewise
attended
by
about
twenty
moorish
gentlemen
all
richly
dressed
when
the
king
had
nearly
attained
our
ships
the
general
went
to
meet
him
in
his
boat
gaily
decorated
with
flags
and
streamers
himself
dressed
in
his
best
apparel
and
attended
by
twelve
of
the
principal
officers
of
the
squadron
leaving
his
brother
in
charge
of
the
ships
on
the
boats
meeting
the
two
parties
made
every
demonstration
of
friendship
and
respect
and
the
moorish
king
immediately
offered
to
come
on
board
the
generals
boat
that
he
might
see
him
the
better
the
general
accordingly
received
him
with
all
respect
and
the
king
shewed
as
much
honour
and
courtesy
to
the
general
as
if
he
had
been
likewise
a
king
the
moorish
king
after
examining
the
dress
and
appearance
of
the
general
and
his
men
with
the
utmost
attention
asked
the
general
the
name
of
his
king
which
he
commanded
to
be
immediately
written
down
he
particularly
inquired
respecting
the
power
of
the
king
of
portugal
and
the
general
gave
the
most
satisfactory
answers
to
all
his
questions
particularly
detailing
the
reasons
of
his
being
sent
to
discover
calicut
that
portugal
might
be
thence
supplied
with
spices
which
were
not
to
be
had
in
his
own
country
the
king
after
giving
him
some
information
on
these
points
and
respecting
the
straits
of
the
red
sea
promised
to
furnish
the
general
with
a
pilot
to
carry
him
to
calicut
and
then
earnestly
solicited
him
to
accompany
him
to
the
city
where
he
might
solace
and
refresh
himself
in
the
palace
after
the
fatigues
and
dangers
of
so
long
a
voyage
and
promised
if
the
general
would
do
so
that
he
the
king
would
visit
him
on
board
to
this
the
general
prudently
answered
that
he
was
not
authorised
by
his
instructions
to
go
on
shore
and
that
he
could
not
answer
for
deviating
from
the
orders
of
his
sovereign
on
this
the
king
observed
that
if
he
were
to
visit
the
ships
he
could
not
well
answer
for
his
conduct
to
the
inhabitants
of
his
city
yet
he
was
grieved
that
the
admiral
refused
to
go
into
the
city
which
should
be
at
his
will
and
pleasure
and
that
of
the
king
his
master
to
whom
he
should
either
write
or
send
an
ambassador
if
the
general
would
call
in
at
melinda
on
his
return
from
calicut
the
general
gave
the
king
thanks
for
his
politeness
and
promised
to
return
that
way
and
while
this
conversation
was
going
on
he
sent
for
the
moors
who
had
been
taken
in
the
pinnace
whom
he
presented
to
the
king
saying
he
would
most
gladly
perform
any
other
service
that
lay
in
his
power
to
the
king
the
king
was
greatly
pleased
with
this
gift
which
he
valued
as
much
as
if
the
admiral
had
given
him
another
city
equal
to
melinda
having
ended
their
conversation
and
confirmed
their
mutual
friendship
the
king
rowed
through
among
our
ships
examining
them
with
much
pleasure
and
admiration
and
was
saluted
in
passing
by
many
discharges
of
the
ordnance
at
which
he
and
his
attendants
seemed
much
delighted
on
this
occasion
the
general
attended
upon
him
in
his
own
boat
out
of
respect
and
the
king
observed
that
he
never
was
so
much
pleased
with
any
men
as
with
the
portuguese
and
would
most
gladly
have
some
of
them
to
help
him
in
his
wars
to
this
the
general
answered
that
if
his
highness
were
to
have
experience
of
what
they
were
able
to
perform
he
would
like
the
portuguese
still
better
and
that
they
should
certainly
give
him
aid
if
it
should
please
the
king
of
portugal
to
send
any
of
his
war
ships
to
calicut
which
he
did
not
doubt
would
be
the
case
if
it
were
gods
will
to
permit
the
discovery
of
that
place
after
the
king
had
satisfied
his
curiosity
he
requested
of
the
general
since
he
would
not
go
himself
into
the
city
to
permit
two
of
his
men
to
go
and
see
the
palace
offering
to
leave
his
own
son
and
one
of
his
chief
priests
which
they
named
caçis
in
pledge
for
their
safe
return
to
this
request
the
general
consented
and
sent
two
of
our
men
along
with
the
king
he
at
his
departure
requested
that
the
general
would
next
day
in
his
boat
come
close
to
the
shore
when
he
should
be
gratified
with
a
sight
of
the
native
horsemen
going
through
their
evolutions
after
this
they
separated
next
day
being
thursday
the
general
and
nicholas
coello
went
in
their
boats
well
armed
along
the
shore
according
to
the
invitation
of
the
king
keeping
at
a
small
distance
from
each
other
for
mutual
defence
in
case
of
need
where
they
saw
many
men
skirmishing
on
the
shore
as
our
boats
approached
the
royal
palace
certain
of
the
kings
attendants
brought
him
in
a
chair
down
some
stone
stairs
which
led
to
the
water
and
being
then
very
near
the
generals
boat
the
king
entered
into
friendly
conversation
with
him
and
once
more
entreated
him
to
land
and
go
to
the
palace
saying
that
his
father
who
was
lame
was
exceedingly
desirous
to
see
him
and
even
offered
that
while
the
general
remained
on
shore
he
and
his
children
would
go
on
board
the
ships
as
hostages
for
his
security
but
our
general
still
dreading
that
some
bitter
treachery
might
lurk
beneath
this
honied
speech
continued
to
excuse
himself
from
landing
as
he
had
not
permission
from
his
own
prince
to
do
so
and
must
obey
him
in
all
things
after
this
taking
his
leave
of
the
king
he
rowed
past
the
ships
of
the
indian
merchants
which
he
saluted
in
passing
with
his
ordnance
and
when
they
saw
us
pass
they
held
up
their
hands
exclaiming
christe
christe
that
night
having
obtained
leave
from
the
king
our
men
made
them
a
great
feast
with
much
diversion
also
of
squibs
firing
of
guns
and
loud
cries
the
fleet
remained
at
anchor
for
two
days
without
any
message
from
the
shore
on
which
account
the
general
was
much
distressed
fearing
the
king
had
taken
offence
at
his
refusal
to
go
on
shore
and
might
break
the
peace
and
amity
between
them
and
not
send
him
any
pilot
but
on
sunday
the
of
april
a
person
who
was
in
high
credit
with
the
king
came
off
to
visit
the
general
who
was
much
disappointed
when
this
person
brought
no
pilot
and
again
began
to
entertain
suspicions
of
the
kings
intentions
when
the
king
learnt
this
and
that
the
general
remained
merely
for
the
purpose
of
having
a
pilot
he
sent
him
one
who
was
a
gentile
called
in
their
language
and
whose
name
was
sending
an
apology
at
the
same
time
for
not
having
sent
this
person
sooner
thus
the
king
and
the
general
remained
friends
and
the
peace
continued
which
had
been
agreed
between
them
de
barros
and
faria
give
this
pilot
the
name
of
and
say
that
he
belonged
to
one
of
the
indian
ships

he
shewed
de

a
very
small
chart
of
the
coast
of
india
laid
down
with
meridians
and
parallels
but
without
rhumbs
of
the
winds
this
pilot
shewed
no
surprise
on
seeing
the
large
wooden
and
metal
astrolabes
belonging
to
the
portuguese
as
the
pilots
of
the
red
sea
had
long
used
brass
triangular
instruments
and
quadrants
for
astronomical
observations
and
that
he
and
others
who
sailed
from
cambaya
and
the
ports
of
india
navigated
by
the
north
and
south
stars
and
the
constellations
of
the
eastern
and
western
hemispheres
and
though
they
did
not
use
these
instruments
in
navigation
they
employed
one
made
of
three
pieces
of
board
similar
to
the
or
of
the
portuguese
in
a
collection
of
papers
published
in
called
from
the
royal
archives
of
lisbon
chiefly
consisting
of
letters
between
the
kings
of
portugal
and
the
tributary
princes
of
the
east
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
or
king
of
melinda
with
whom
de
gama
afterwards
made
a
treaty
of
alliance
and
whose
ambassador
he
carried
into
portugal
was
named
wagerage
having
thus
procured
a
pilot
and
provided
all
things
necessary
for
the
voyage
de
gama
departed
from
melinda
for
calicut
on
friday
the
of
april
and
immediately
made
sail
directly
across
the
gulf
which
separates
africa
from
india
which
is
leagues
this
golf
runs
a
long
way
up
into
the
land
northwards
but
our
course
for
calicut
lay
to
the
east
in
following
this
voyage
our
men
saw
the
north
star
next
sunday
which
they
had
not
seen
of
a
long
while
and
they
saw
the
stars
about
the
south
pole
at
the
same
time
they
gave
thanks
to
god
that
whereas
it
had
been
represented
to
them
that
in
this
season
which
was
the
winter
of
the
indies
there
were
always
great
storms
in
this
gulf
they
now
experienced
fair
weather
on
friday
the
of
may
three
days
after
leaving
melinda
during
all
which
time
they
had
seen
no
land
they
came
in
sight
of
india
at
eight
leagues
distance
the
land
seeming
very
high
canaca
the
pilot
tried
the
lead
and
found
fathoms
upon
which
he
altered
his
course
to
the
having
fallen
in
with
the
land
too
far
to
the
north
upon
the
saturday
he
again
drew
near
the
land
but
did
not
certainly
know
it
as
the
view
was
obscured
by
rain
which
always
falls
in
india
at
this
season
being
their
winter
on
sunday
the
of
may
the
pilot
got
view
of
certain
high
hills
which
are
directly
behind
the
city
of
calicut
and
came
so
near
the
land
that
he
was
quite
sure
of
the
place
on
which
he
came
up
with
great
joy
to
the
general
demanding
his
or
reward
as
this
was
the
place
at
which
he
and
his
company
were
so
desirous
to
arrive
the
general
was
greatly
rejoiced
at
this
news
and
immediately
satisfied
the
pilot
after
which
he
summoned
all
the
company
to
prayers
saying
the
and
giving
hearty
thanks
to
god
who
had
safely
conducted
them
to
the
long
place
of
his
destination
when
prayer
was
over
there
was
great
festivity
and
joy
in
the
ships
which
came
that
same
evening
to
anchor
two
leagues
from
calicut
immediately
upon
anchoring
some
of
the
natives
came
off
to
the
ships
in
four
boats
called
inquiring
whence
our
ships
came
as
they
had
never
before
seen
any
resembling
their
construction
upon
that
coast
these
natives
were
of
a
brown
colour
and
entirely
naked
excepting
very
small
aprons
some
of
them
immediately
came
on
board
the
general
and
the
guzerat
pilot
informed
him
these
were
poor
fishermen
yet
the
general
received
them
courteously
and
ordered
his
people
to
purchase
the
fish
which
they
had
brought
for
sale
on
conversing
with
them
he
understood
that
the
town
whence
they
came
which
was
in
sight
was
not
calicut
which
lay
farther
off
and
to
which
they
offered
to
conduct
our
fleet
whereupon
the
general
requested
them
to
do
this
and
departing
from
this
first
anchorage
the
fleet
was
conducted
by
these
fishermen
to
calicut
calicut
is
a
city
on
the
coast
of
malabar
a
province
of
the
second
india
which
begins
at
the
mount
of
delhi
and
ends
at
cape
comory
being
one
leagues
in
length
and
fifteen
leagues
broad
the
whole
of
this
country
is
very
low
and
apt
to
be
covered
with
water
having
many
islands
in
its
rivers
which
flow
into
the
indian
sea
this
country
of
malabar
is
divided
from
the
kingdom
of
narsinga
by
a
very
high
hill
the
indians
report
that
this
land
of
malabar
was
covered
by
the
sea
of
old
which
then
reached
to
the
foot
of
the
hills
and
thence
to
a
hill
where
now
the
islands
of
the
maldives
are
found
which
were
then
firm
land
and
that
in
after
times
it
destroyed
that
latter
country
and
laid
bare
the
country
of
malabar
in
which
are
many
pleasant
and
rich
cities
dependent
upon
trade
which
they
carry
on
principally
with
calicut
which
exceeds
all
cities
of
our
days
in
riches
and
in
vice
its
foundation
and
rise
was
as
follows
in
ancient
times
this
country
of
malabar
was
entirely
ruled
by
one
king
who
dwelt
in
the
city
of
in
the
reign
of
the
last
king
of
this
race
named
who
died
years
ago
the
moors
of
mecca
discovered
india
and
came
to
the
province
of
malabar
then
inhabited
by
idolaters
and
governed
by
an
idolatrous
king
from
the
time
of
the
coming
of
these
moors
they
began
to
reckon
their
years
as
we
do
from
the
birth
of
our
saviour
after
the
coming
of
the
moors
into
malabar
they
insinuated
themselves
so
much
into
the
confidence
of
the
king
that
he
became
a
convert
to
their
law
renouncing
the
religion
of
his
country
and
embracing
mahometism
with
such
zeal
that
he
resolved
to
go
and
end
his
days
in
the
temple
of
mecca
having
thus
resolved
out
of
love
to
the
mahometan
sect
to
abandon
his
kingdom
he
called
his
kindred
together
and
divided
all
his
territories
among
them
reserving
only
twelve
leagues
of
country
near
the
place
where
he
intended
to
embark
not
then
inhabited
which
he
bestowed
upon
one
of
his
cousins
who
acted
as
his
page
to
this
kinsman
he
gave
his
sword
and
turban
as
ensigns
of
dignity
commanding
all
the
other
nobles
among
whom
he
had
distributed
the
rest
of
his
territories
to
obey
this
person
as
their
emperor
the
kings
of
coulan
and
cananor
only
excepted
whom
also
and
all
the
others
he
debarred
from
coining
money
which
was
only
to
be
done
by
the
king
of
calicut
having
thus
given
away
his
whole
dignities
and
possessions
and
set
every
thing
in
order
he
embarked
from
the
place
where
calicut
now
stands
and
because
this
king
embarked
from
that
place
on
his
pilgrimage
to
mecca
the
moors
have
ever
since
held
calicut
in
so
high
devotion
that
they
and
all
their
posterity
would
never
take
their
lading
from
any
other
port
from
that
time
forwards
they
discontinued
trade
with
the
port
of
coulan
which
they
had
used
formerly
and
that
port
therefore
fell
to
ruin
especially
after
the
building
of
calicut
and
the
settlement
of
many
moors
in
that
place
as
the
moors
are
merchants
of
most
extensive
dealings
they
have
rendered
calicut
as
the
centre
of
their
trade
the
richest
mart
of
all
the
indies
in
which
is
to
be
found
all
the
spices
drugs
nutmegs
and
other
things
that
can
be
desired
all
kinds
of
precious
stones
pearls
and
musk
sanders
aguila
fine
dishes
of
earthen
ware
lacker
gilded
coffers
and
all
the
fine
things
of
china
gold
amber
wax
ivory
fine
and
coarse
cotton
goods
both
white
and
dyed
of
many
colours
much
raw
and
twisted

stuffs
of
silk
and
gold
cloth
of
gold
cloth
of
tissue
grain
scarlets
silk
carpets
copper
quicksilver
vermilion
alum
coral
and
all
kinds
of
conserves
thus
every
kind
of
merchandize
from
all
parts
of
the
world
is
to
be
found
in
this
place
which
moreover
is
very
quiet
being
situated
along
the
coast
which
is
almost
open
and
very
dangerous
calicut
is
surrounded
by
many
gardens
and
orchards
producing
all
the
herbs
and
fruits
of
this
country
in
great
abundance
having
also
many
palms
and
other
sorts
of
trees
and
abounds
in
excellent
water
this
part
of
india
produces
but
little
rice
which
is
a
principal
article
of
food
in
these
parts
as
wheat
is
with
us
but
it
procures
abundance
of
that
and
all
other
kinds
of
provisions
from
other
countries
the
city
is
large
but
the
dwellings
consist
only
of
straw
huts
their
idol
temples
and
chapels
and
the
kings
palace
excepted
which
are
built
of
stone
and
lime
and
covered
with
tiles
for
by
their
laws
no
others
are
permitted
to
build
their
houses
of
any
other
material
than
straw
at
this
time
calicut
was
inhabited
by
idolaters
of
many
sects
and
by
many
moorish
merchants
some
of
whom
were
so
rich
as
to
be
owners
of
fifty
ships
these
ships
are
made
without
nails
their
planks
being
sewed
together
with
ropes
of
made
of
the
fibres
of
the
husk
pitched
all
over
and
are
without
keels
every
winter
there
are
at
least
six
hundred
ships
in
this
harbour
and
the
shore
is
such
that
their
ships
can
be
easily
drawn
up
for
repairs
the
subjects
of
the
following
digression
are
so
intimately
connected
with
the
first
establishment
of
the
portuguese
in
india
as
to
justify
its
introduction
in
this
place
which
will
greatly
elucidate
the
narrative
of
castaneda
and
its
length
did
not
admit
of
being
inserted
in
the
form
of
notes
it
is
chiefly
due
to
the
ingenious
and
reverend
james
stanier
clarke
in
his
origin
and
progress
of
maritime
discovery
extracted
by
him
from
various
sources
the
name
of
this
country
malabar
is
said
to
be
derived
from
which
signifies
in
the
original
language
of
that
part
of
india
the
bottom
of
the
corrupted
into
maleyam
or
maleam
whence
probably
came
mulievar
and
in
a
account
of
malabar
it
is
said
that
little
more
than
years
ago
the
sea
came
up
to
the
foot
of
the
mountains
or
the
western
the
emerging
of
the
country
from
the
waters
is
fabulously
related
to
have
been
occasioned
by
the
piety
or
penitence
of
puresram
rama
who
prayed
to
the
god
of
the
ocean
to
give
him
a
track
of
land
to
bestow
on
the
bramins
varauna
accordingly
commanded
the
sea
to
withdraw
from
the
a
hill
near
mangalore
all
the
way
to
cape
comorin
which
new
land
long
remained
marshy
and
scarcely
habitable
and
the
original
settlers
were
forced
to
abandon
it
on
account
of
the
numerous
serpents
by
which
it
was
infested
but
they
afterwards
returned
being
instructed
to
propitiate
the
serpents
by
worshipping
them
at
first
this
country
was
divided
into
four
or
provinces
these
into
or
districts
and
these
again
into
or
small
precincts
the
bramins
established
a
kind
of
republican
or
aristocratical
government
under
a
few
principal
chiefs
but
jealousies
and
disturbances
taking
place
they
procured
a
or
chief
governor
from
the
prince
of
chaldesh
a
sovereignty
in
the
southern
carnatic
yet
it
is
more
likely
that
this
sovereign
took
advantage
of
the
divisions
among
the
chiefs
of
malabar
to
reduce
them
under
his
authority
these
permauls
or
viceroys
were
for
a
long
while
changed
every
twelve
years
till
at
length
one
of
them
named
cheruma
perumal
or
shermanoo
permaloo
the
of
castaneda
became
so
popular
that
he
set
his
master
the
rajah
of
chaldesh
at
defiance
and
established
his
own
authority
in
malabar
an
army
was
sent
into
malabar
to
reduce
the
country
again
to
obedience
but
it
was
defeated
and
from
this
event
which
is
said
to
have
happened
years
ago
all
the
rajahs
chief
and
other
lords
of
malabar
date
the
sovereignty
and
independence
of
their
ancestors
in
that
country
after
some
time
either
became
weary
of
his
situation
or
from
attachment
to
the
mahometan
religion
resolved
to
make
a
division
of
malabar
among
his
dependents
from
whom
the
present
chieftains
are
descended
such
is
the
current
story
among
the
inhabitants
of
malabar
yet
it
is
more
probable
that
his
dependent
chieftains
disgusted
with
his
conversion
to
the
religion
of
mahomet
revolted
from
his
authority
and
contrived
this
story
of
his
voluntary
surrender
and
division
of
his
dominions
to
justify
their
own
assumptions
after
this
division
of
his
kingdom
it
is
said
that
an
or
person
of
the
cast
of
originally
from
the
banks
of
the
cavery
near
errode
in
the
carnatic
who
had
been
a
chief
instrument
of
the
success
of
in
the
war
against
rajah
kishen
rao
made
application
to
shermanoo
for
some
support
having
very
little
left
to
give
away
shermanoo
made
him
a
grant
of
his
own
place
of
abode
at
calicut
and
gave
him
his
sword
and
other
insignia
of
command
and
presented
him
with
water
and
flowers
the
ancient
symbols
of
a
transfer
of
property
it
is
said
that
this
cowherd
rajah
was
ordained
principal
sovereign
over
the
other
petty
princes
among
whom
malabar
was
divided
with
the
title
of
zamorin
and
was
authorized
by
shermanoo
to
extend
his
dominion
over
all
the
other
chieftains
by
force
of
arms
his
descendants
have
ever
since
endeavoured
on
all
occasions
to
enforce
this
pretended
grant
which
they
pretend
to
hold
by
the
tenure
of
possessing
the
sword
of
shermanoo
permaloo
and
which
they
carefully
preserve
as
a
precious
relic
from
the
period
of
the
abdication
of
shermanoo
to
that
of
the
arrival
of
the
portuguese
at
calicut
the
mahomedan
religion
had
made
considerable
progress
in
malabar
and
the
arabian
merchants
received
every
encouragement
from
the
samoories
or
zamorins
as
they
made
calicut
the
staple
of
their
indian
trade
and
brought
large
sums
of
money
yearly
to
that
place
for
the
purchase
of
spiceries
and
other
commodities
as
the
rajahs
of
cochin
and
other
petty
sovereignties
on
the
coast
were
exceedingly
jealous
of
the
superior
riches
and
power
of
the
zamorins
and
of
the
monopoly
of
trade
enjoyed
by
calicut
they
gave
every
encouragement
to
the
portuguese
to
frequent
their
ports
from
whence
arose
a
series
of
warfare
by
sea
and
land
which
has
finally
reduced
them
all
under
subjection
to
the
europeans
according
to
an
arabian
author
who
is
supposed
to
have
been
sent
to
assist
the
zamorins
and
the
mahomedans
in
india
in
their
wars
with
the
portuguese
malabar
is
then
said
to
have
been
divided
among
a
multiplicity
of
independent
princes
or
rajahs
whom
he
calls
some
of
whom
commanded
over
one
or
two
hundred
men
and
others
one
ten
fifteen
or
even
as
high
as
thirty
thousand
or
upwards
the
three
greatest
powers
at
that
time
were
the
rajah
to
the
north
the
zamorin
of
calicut
in
the
centre
and
a
rajah
in
the
south
who
ruled
from
coulan
kalum
or
coulim
to
cape
comorin
comprehending
the
country
now
belonging
to
the
rajah
of
travancore
we
now
return
from
this
digression
to
follow
the
narrative
of
the
portuguese
discovery
and
conquest
of
india
as
related
by
castaneda
so
great
was
the
trade
and
population
of
calicut
and
the
surrounding
country
and
the
revenues
of
its
sovereign
through
these
circumstances
that
he
was
able
to
raise
a
force
of
thirty
thousand
men
in
a
single
day
and
could
even
bring
an
hundred
thousand
men
into
the
field
completely
equipt
for
war
in
three
days
this
prince
in
the
language
of
the
country
was
styled
the
zamorin
or
samoryn
which
signifies
emperor
as
he
was
supreme
over
the
other
two
kings
of
malabar
the
king
of
coulan
and
the
king
of
cananor
there
were
indeed
other
princes
in
this
country
who
were
called
kings
but
were
not
so
this
zamorin
or
king
of
calicut
was
a
bramin
as
his
predecessors
had
been
the
bramins
being
priests
among
the
malabars
it
is
an
ancient
rule
and
custom
among
these
people
that
all
their
kings
must
die
in
a
pagoda
or
temple
of
their
idols
and
that
there
must
always
be
a
king
resident
in
the
principal
pagoda
to
serve
those
idols
wherefore
when
the
king
that
serves
in
the
temple
comes
to
die
he
who
then
reigns
must
leave
his
government
of
temporal
affairs
to
take
his
place
in
the
temple
upon
which
another
is
elected
to
take
his
place
and
to
succeed
in
ruling
the
kingdom
if
the
king
who
is
in
possession
of
the
temporal
authority
should
refuse
to
retire
to
the
pagoda
on
the
death
of
the
king
who
officiated
in
spirituals
he
is
constrained
to
do
so
however
unwilling
the
kings
and
nobles
of
malabar
are
of
a
brown
complexion
and
go
naked
from
the
waist
upwards
all
the
under
parts
of
their
bodies
being
clothed
in
silk
or
cotton
vestments
yet
they
sometimes
wear
short
gowns
on
their
upper
parts
called
of
rich
silk
or
cloth
of
gold
or
of
scarlet
splendidly
ornamented
with
precious
stones
of
all
which
the
zamorin
hath
great
store
they
shave
their
beards
leaving
only
the
hair
on
their
upper
lips
and
do
not
shave
the
head
like
the
turks
in
general
the
natives
of
this
country
even
of
the
higher
ranks
use
little
state
in
their
households
and
are
very
sparing
in
their
diet
but
the
zamorin
is
served
with
considerable
splendour
these
kings
or
nobles
never
marry
but
every
one
has
a
mistress
of
the
nayre
cast
which
among
the
malabars
are
considered
as
the
gentry
even
the
zamorin
has
only
a
mistress
who
has
a
house
of
her
own
near
the
palace
and
a
liberal
allowance
for
the
charges
of
her
household
and
maintenance
at
her
own
disposal
upon
any
dislike
or
difference
he
may
always
leave
her
for
another
the
children
are
only
considered
as
the
offspring
of
the
mother
and
have
no
right
or
title
to
inherit
the
kingdom
or
any
thing
else
belonging
to
the
father
and
when
grown
up
are
only
held
in
that
rank
or
estimation
which
belongs
to
the
blood
or
parentage
of
their
mother
brothers
succeed
to
brothers
and
in
lack
of
these
the
sons
of
their
sisters
who
do
not
marry
and
have
no
certainty
respecting
the
fathers
of
their
children
as
they
are
very
free
and
dissolute
in
their
manners
choosing
paramours
as
they
please
these
sisters
of
the
zamorin
and
other
kings
of
malabar
have
handsome
allowances
to
live
upon
and
when
any
of
them
reaches
the
age
of
ten
their
kindred
send
for
a
young
man
of
the
nayre
cast
out
of
the
kingdom
and
give
him
great
presents
to
induce
him
to
initiate
the
young
virgin
after
which
he
hangs
a
jewel
round
her
neck
which
she
wears
all
the
rest
of
her
life
as
a
token
that
she
is
now
at
liberty
to
dispose
of
herself
to
any
one
she
pleases
as
long
as
she
lives
when
these
kings
are
at
war
with
each
other
they
often
go
personally
into
the
field
and
even
join
personally
in
fight
upon
occasion
when
one
of
them
dies
the
body
is
carried
out
into
the
fields
and
burned
on
a
pile
of
sanders
and
of
another
sweet
smelling
wood
called
all
his
brothers
and
kindred
and
all
the
nobles
of
the
country
being
present
at
the
ceremony
which
is
uniformly
postponed
to
the
third
day
after
death
that
all
may
have
time
to
gather
from
a
distance
and
may
have
an
opportunity
of
being
assured
whether
his
death
was
natural
or
caused
by
violence
since
if
he
died
by
the
hand
of
any
one
all
are
bound
to
prosecute
revenge
after
the
body
is
burnt
and
the
ashes
buried
the
whole
company
shaves
every
part
of
their
bodies
even
to
the
youngest
child
of
these
idolaters
this
is
their
token
of
mourning
and
during
the
ensuing
thirteen
days
they
all
refrain
from
chewing
betel
any
one
infringing
this
law
being
punished
by
cutting
his
lips
during
this
period
of
thirteen
days
he
who
is
to
succeed
to
the
throne
must
abstain
from
all
exercise
of
government
that
any
one
who
pleases
may
have
an
opportunity
of
urging
any
valid
objection
why
he
should
not
acquire
the
vacant
government
after
this
the
successor
is
sworn
before
all
the
nobles
of
the
country
to
preserve
and
enforce
all
the
laws
and
customs
of
their
ancestors
to
pay
the
debts
of
his
predecessor
and
to
use
his
utmost
endeavours
to
recover
any
portion
of
the
kingdom
that
may
have
been
lost
while
taking
this
oath
having
his
sword
in
his
left
hand
he
holds
in
his
right
hand
a
burning
candle
on
which
is
a
gold
ring
which
he
touches
with
his
fingers
after
this
they
throw
some
grains
of
rice
over
him
using
many
other
ceremonies
and
numerous
prayers
and
then
worship
the
sun
three
times
when
all
these
ceremonies
are
gone
through
all
the
or
lords
of
noble
birth
taking
hold
of
the
candle
take
an
oath
to
be
true
and
faithful
subjects
to
the
new
king
after
the
end
of
the
thirteen
days
mourning
they
all
begin
to
chew
betel
and
to
eat
flesh
and
fish
as
formerly
the
new
king
alone
excepted
he
is
bound
to
mourn
for
his
predecessor
during
a
whole
year
chewing
no
betel
eating
no
flesh
or
fish
neither
shaving
his
beard
nor
cutting
his
nails
during
all
that
time
he
must
eat
only
once
washing
himself
all
over
before
this
single
meal
and
devoting
certain
hours
of
every
day
to
prayer
after
the
expiry
of
the
year
he
uses
a
certain
ceremony
for
the
soul
of
the
king
his
predecessor
much
like
our
solemn
dirge
at
which
persons
are
often
assembled
among
whom
he
distributes
large
alms
when
this
ceremony
is
ended
the
prince
is
confirmed
as
inheritor
of
the
kingdom
and
all
the
people
depart
the
zamorin
of
calicut
and
the
other
kings
of
malabar
have
each
one
especial
officer
to
whom
the
administration
of
justice
is
confided
and
whose
authority
in
all
matters
of
government
is
as
ample
as
that
of
the
king
himself
the
soldiers
employed
by
these
kings
are
called
who
are
all
gentlemen
and
who
follow
no
other
office
or
employ
but
that
of
fighting
when
needed
they
are
all
idolaters
armed
with
bows
arrows
spears
daggers
of
a
hooked
form
and
targets
and
they
march
in
a
very
regular
and
warlike
manner
but
they
go
entirely
naked
and
barefooted
wearing
only
a
piece
of
painted
cotton
cloth
which
reaches
from
the
girdle
to
the
knees
and
a
cloth
or
kerchief
on
their
heads
all
these
men
live
continually
at
the
charge
of
the
king
and
nobles
of
the
country
from
whom
they
have
small
stipends
for
their
maintenance
and
they
esteem
themselves
so
highly
on
account
of
their
gentility
of
blood
that
they
will
not
touch
an
husbandman
nor
allow
any
such
to
enter
into
their
dwellings
when
any
husbandman
goes
through
the
streets
they
must
continually
call
out
aloud
for
if
commanded
by
a
nayre
to
make
way
they
may
be
slain
if
they
refuse
the
king
can
not
raise
any
one
to
the
rank
of
a
who
are
all
such
by
descent
these
serve
very
faithfully
under
those
who
give
them
their
wages
not
sparing
by
day
or
night
to
use
their
best
endeavours
to
serve
their
chiefs
nor
making
any
account
of
want
of
food
or
sleep
or
of
fatigue
when
their
service
is
required
or
may
be
effectual
their
expences
are
so
small
that
on
which
is
their
only
monthly
pay
they
can
sufficiently
maintain
themselves
and
a
boy
whom
each
has
as
a
servant
by
the
laws
of
this
country
these
nayres
can
not
marry
so
that
no
one
has
any
certain
or
acknowledged
son
or
father
all
their
children
being
born
of
mistresses
with
each
of
whom
three
or
four
nayres
cohabit
by
agreement
among
themselves
each
one
of
this
confraternity
dwells
a
day
in
his
turn
with
the
joint
mistress
counting
from
noon
of
one
day
to
the
same
time
of
the
next
after
which
he
departs
and
another
comes
for
the
like
time
they
thus
spend
their
lives
without
the
care
or
trouble
of
wives
and
children
yet
maintain
their
mistresses
well
according
to
their
rank
any
one
may
forsake
his
mistress
at
his
pleasure
and
in
like
manner
the
mistress
may
refuse
admittance
to
any
one
her
lovers
when
she
pleases
these
mistresses
are
all
gentlewomen
of
the
nayre
cast
and
the
nayres
besides
being
prohibited
from
marrying
must
not
attach
themselves
to
any
woman
of
a
different
rank
considering
that
there
are
always
several
men
attached
to
one
woman
the
nayres
never
look
upon
any
of
these
children
born
of
their
mistresses
as
belonging
to
them
however
strong
a
resemblance
may
subsist
and
all
inheritances
among
the
nayres
go
to
their
brothers
or
the
sons
of
their
sisters
born
of
the
same
mothers
all
relationship
being
counted
only
by
female
consanguinity
and
descent
this
strange
law
prohibiting
marriage
was
established
that
they
might
have
neither
wives
or
children
on
whom
to
fix
their
love
and
attachment
and
that
being
free
from
all
family
cares
they
might
the
more
willingly
devote
themselves
entirely
to
warlike
service
and
the
more
to
animate
these
gentlemen
in
the
service
of
the
wars
and
to
encourage
them
to
continue
in
the
order
of
nayres
they
are
privileged
from
all
imprisonments
and
from
the
punishment
of
death
on
all
ordinary
occasions
except
for
the
following
crimes
killing
another
nayre
or
a
cow
which
is
an
object
of
worship
sleeping
or
eating
with
an
ordinary
woman
or
speaking
evil
of
the
king
when
the
king
has
received
authentic
information
of
any
of
these
offences
having
been
committed
he
issues
a
written
mandate
to
one
of
the
nayres
commanding
him
to
take
two
or
three
other
nayres
in
his
company
and
to
slay
the
nayre
who
has
committed
this
offence
against
the
laws
in
obedience
to
this
warrant
they
attack
him
with
their
swords
and
put
him
to
death
they
happen
to
find
him
and
then
affix
the
royal
order
upon
his
body
that
all
may
know
the
reason
of
his
death
it
is
not
permitted
to
any
nayre
to
assume
arms
or
to
enter
into
any
combat
till
he
has
been
armed
as
a
knight
when
a
nayre
becomes
seven
years
old
he
is
set
to
learn
the
use
of
all
kinds
of
weapons
their
masters
first
pulling
and
twisting
their
joints
to
make
them
supple
and
then
teaching
them
to
fence
and
handle
their
arms
adroitly
their
principal
weapons
are
swords
and
targets
and
these
teachers
who
are
graduates
in
the
use
of
the
weapons
are
called
who
are
much
esteemed
among
the
nayres
and
all
their
former
scholars
however
advanced
in
life
or
however
high
their
dignity
are
bound
at
all
times
to
give
them
due
honour
and
reverence
when
they
meet
likewise
every
is
obliged
to
take
lessons
from
these
professors
for
two
months
yearly
all
their
lives
by
this
means
they
are
very
skilful
in
the
use
of
their
weapons
in
which
they
take
great
pride
when
a
nayre
desires
to
be
armed
as
a
knight
he
presents
himself
before
the
king
accompanied
by
all
his
kindred
and
friends
and
makes
an
offering
of
sixty
gold
fannoms
on
which
he
is
asked
by
the
king
if
he
is
willing
to
observe
and
follow
the
laws
and
customs
of
the
nayres
to
which
he
answers
in
the
affirmative
then
the
king
commands
him
to
be
girt
with
a
sword
and
laying
his
right
hand
on
his
head
utters
certain
words
as
if
praying
in
so
low
a
voice
that
he
is
not
heard
the
king
then
embraces
the
young
nayre
saying
aloud
in
their
language
take
good
care
to
defend
the
bramins
and
their
kine
on
this
the
nayre
falls
down
and
does
reverence
to
the
king
and
from
that
time
he
is
considered
as
a
knight
or
member
of
the
fraternity
of
nayres
when
any
of
the
nayres
enters
into
the
peculiar
service
of
the
king
or
of
any
individual
noble
he
binds
himself
to
die
with
and
for
him
and
they
keep
their
oaths
for
if
their
master
should
happen
to
be
slain
in
any
war
or
otherwise
they
will
fight
till
they
are
all
slain
and
if
they
can
not
accomplish
their
purpose
at
the
time
or
happen
to
be
absent
at
the
slaughter
of
their
master
they
go
afterwards
in
search
of
the
person
who
has
done
the
deed
and
never
leave
off
till
they
are
themselves
slain
the
malabars
are
much
given
to
soothsaying
and
have
lucky
and
unlucky
days
they
worship
the
sun
moon
and
stars
the
fire
cows
and
the
first
thing
they
meet
on
going
out
of
a
morning
believing
every
manner
of
vanity
the
devil
is
often
in
them
but
they
say
it
is
one
of
their
gods
or
as
they
call
him
but
whosoever
or
whatsoever
it
may
be
it
constrains
them
to
utter
terrible
words
which
are
believed
by
the
king
when
the
devil
enters
into
a
nayre
he
goes
with
a
naked
sword
before
the
king
shaking
and
trembling
and
giving
himself
many
wounds
saying
i
am
such
or
such
a
god
and
am
come
to
tell
thee
such
and
such
a
thing
crying
out
and
behaving
himself
like
a
madman
or
one
possessed
if
the
king
makes
any
doubt
of
what
he
says
he
continues
to
roar
still
louder
and
to
slash
himself
more
severely
till
the
king
gives
credit
to
his
assertions
there
are
other
tribes
or
lineages
of
people
among
the
malabars
of
various
sects
and
divers
customs
of
whom
it
were
too
tedious
to
speak
in
this
place
who
are
all
under
obedience
to
the
several
kings
and
nobles
the
moors
alone
are
exempted
from
this
obedience
on
account
of
the
large
customs
they
pay
for
their
merchandize
owing
to
which
they
are
held
in
high
estimation
at
calicut
having
come
to
anchor
on
the
outside
of
the
bar
or
reef
of
calicut
the
general
sent
one
of
the
portuguese
convicts
on
shore
in
one
of
the
almadias
which
had
conducted
the
ships
to
this
port
instructing
him
to
see
what
kind
of
a
place
it
was
and
to
make
trial
of
what
kind
of
a
reception
might
be
looked
for
seeing
we
were
christians
and
as
the
general
believed
that
the
people
were
likewise
christians
when
this
man
landed
he
was
immediately
surrounded
by
great
numbers
of
the
natives
staring
at
him
as
a
stranger
these
people
asked
of
the
fishermen
what
man
this
was
whom
they
had
brought
on
shore
to
which
they
answered
that
they
supposed
him
to
be
a
moor
and
that
he
belonged
to
the
three
ships
which
were
riding
without
the
bar
but
the
people
of
calicut
wondered
much
to
see
a
person
who
was
clothed
so
very
differently
from
the
moors
who
came
from
the
red
sea
some
of
these
people
who
had
knowledge
of
arabic
spoke
to
this
man
but
he
could
not
understand
or
answer
them
at
which
they
were
much
astonished
yet
believing
him
to
be
a
moor
they
conducted
him
to
a
house
where
two
moors
dwelt
who
came
originally
from
tunis
and
had
established
themselves
in
calicut
on
his
appearance
one
of
these
moors
whose
name
was
bontaybo
who
could
speak
spanish
immediately
recognized
him
for
a
portuguese
having
often
seen
people
of
our
nation
at
tunis
in
the
reign
of
king
john
in
a
ship
named
la
reyna
which
often
traded
to
that
port
as
soon
as
bontaybo
saw
the
portuguese
he
exclaimed
in
spanish
take
you
what
brought
you
he
farther
inquired
which
way
he
had
travelled
so
as
to
arrive
at
calicut
to
this
the
banished
man
answered
telling
how
many
ships
our
general
had
brought
with
him
at
which
bontaybo
was
much
amazed
wondering
how
they
could
possibly
come
by
sea
from
portugal
to
india
he
then
asked
what
they
sought
at
so
great
a
distance
from
home
and
was
answered
that
they
came
in
search
of
christians
and
spices
bontaybo
then
asked
why
the
kings
of
france
and
spain
and
the
doge
of
venice
had
not
sent
their
ships
likewise
because
said
our
man
the
king
of
portugal
would
not
allow
them
to
this
bontaybo
said
he
was
much
in
the
right
after
some
farther
conversation
in
this
way
bontaybo
gave
him
good
entertainment
commanding
certain
cakes
of
wheat
flour
and
honey
called
by
the
malabars
to
be
set
before
him
and
then
said
that
he
would
accompany
him
to
the
ships
to
wait
upon
the
general
bontaybo
accordingly
came
on
board
our
general
whom
he
immediately
addressed
in
spanish
saying
good
luck
good
luck
many
rubies
many
emeralds
thou
art
bound
to
give
god
thanks
for
having
brought
thee
where
there
is
abundance
of
all
sorts
of
spices
precious
stones
and
all
the
other
riches
of
the
world
on
hearing
this
the
general
and
all
the
people
were
greatly
astonished
not
expecting
to
meet
any
one
so
far
from
home
who
understood
their
language
and
even
shed
tears
of
joy
for
this
happy
circumstance
and
their
safe
arrival
they
all
then
joined
in
humble
and
hearty
thanks
to
the
almighty
by
whose
favour
and
assistance
alone
this
great
happiness
and
good
fortune
had
been
accorded
to
them
the
general
embraced
bontaybo
whom
he
made
to
sit
beside
him
and
questioned
him
if
he
were
a
christian
and
how
he
came
to
calicut
bontaybo
told
him
frankly
that
he
was
a
moor
from
tunis
in
barbary
and
had
come
to
calicut
by
way
of
cairo
and
the
red
sea
and
explained
how
he
came
to
know
the
portuguese
as
has
been
already
mentioned
he
farther
declared
that
he
had
always
been
well
disposed
towards
the
portuguese
nation
having
always
found
them
worthy
of
confidence
and
friendship
in
all
their
dealings
and
having
been
a
friend
to
them
in
times
past
he
would
not
discontinue
his
good
will
and
was
ready
and
willing
to
do
every
thing
in
his
power
to
serve
them
and
to
assist
them
in
the
objects
for
which
they
had
now
come
to
calicut
the
general
gave
him
many
thanks
for
his
good
will
and
promised
to
reward
him
liberally
for
the
friendly
aid
he
might
give
to
him
and
his
expedition
expressing
his
extreme
satisfaction
at
being
so
fortunate
as
to
meet
such
a
person
in
this
place
believing
that
god
had
sent
him
here
to
promote
the
great
objects
of
this
voyage
for
which
he
passed
through
so
many
and
long
continued
dangers
being
quite
sensible
that
he
must
have
reaped
little
profit
from
all
his
labours
without
such
friendly
assistance
the
general
then
requested
information
from
bontaybo
as
to
the
character
of
the
king
or
zamorin
of
calicut
and
whether
in
his
opinion
he
would
willingly
receive
him
as
ambassador
from
the
king
of
portugal
bontaybo
represented
the
zamorin
as
a
prince
of
good
and
honourable
dispositions
who
he
was
convinced
would
gladly
receive
the
general
as
ambassador
from
a
foreign
king
more
especially
if
the
objects
of
his
voyage
were
to
establish
a
trade
with
calicut
and
if
the
general
had
brought
with
him
any
merchandize
proper
for
that
purpose
since
the
advantages
which
the
zamorin
derived
from
the
customs
upon
trade
formed
the
chief
source
of
his
revenue
he
farther
informed
the
general
that
the
zamorin
resided
at
this
time
at
panane
a
village
on
the
coast
about
five
leagues
from
calicut
and
advised
that
the
general
should
send
a
message
there
to
notify
his
arrival
and
the
reasons
of
his
coming
the
general
was
well
pleased
with
this
advice
and
presented
certain
gifts
to
bontaybo
along
with
whom
he
sent
two
of
his
men
to
calicut
requesting
bontaybo
to
direct
them
on
their
way
to
panane
which
he
did
accordingly
when
these
messengers
came
into
the
presence
of
the
zamorin
one
of
them
named
declared
to
him
by
means
of
an
interpreter
that
he
waited
upon
his
highness
on
the
part
of
his
general
who
had
arrived
in
the
port
of
calicut
with
three
ships
having
been
sent
there
by
the
king
of
portugal
with
letters
to
his
highness
which
the
general
begged
permission
to
present
to
him
on
hearing
this
message
and
before
giving
any
answer
the
zamorin
commanded
each
of
the
two
messengers
to
be
presented
with
a
piece
cotton
cloth
and
two
pieces
of
silk
such
as
he
used
in
his
own
apparel
after
which
he
inquired
of
fernan
martyn
what
king
it
was
who
had
sent
him
these
letters
and
how
far
his
dominions
were
from
thence
fernan
fully
answered
these
inquiries
adding
that
he
was
a
christian
prince
and
that
those
whom
he
had
sent
in
the
ships
now
at
calicut
were
christians
and
related
what
great
and
numerous
dangers
they
had
passed
through
during
their
voyage
the
zamorin
was
much
amazed
at
the
incidents
of
the
voyage
which
fernan
related
at
some
length
and
expressed
his
satisfaction
that
so
powerful
a
prince
of
the
christians
should
think
of
sending
an
ambassador
to
him
from
so
great
a
distance
he
then
desired
fernan
to
inform
the
general
that
he
heartily
welcomed
him
and
his
people
into
his
dominions
advising
him
to
bring
his
ships
to
anchor
near
a
village
called
some
way
below
where
the
ships
then
lay
as
a
far
better
harbour
than
calicut
which
is
an
open
and
very
dangerous
road
for
shipping
the
zamorin
desired
likewise
that
the
general
might
come
by
land
from
that
place
to
calicut
where
he
would
be
ready
to
receive
him
after
this
the
zamorin
sent
a
pilot
to
navigate
the
ships
to
the
harbour
of
pandarane
but
on
coming
to
the
bar
of
that
port
the
general
did
not
think
it
advisable
to
enter
so
far
within
the
harbour
as
the
pilot
proposed
fearing
lest
he
might
expose
himself
to
danger
by
reposing
too
great
confidence
in
these
people
and
placing
himself
too
much
within
their
power
in
this
he
acted
with
much
prudent
foresight
by
which
he
wisely
avoided
the
injuries
which
were
afterwards
attempted
against
him
at
this
place
on
his
arrival
at
pandarane
the
general
received
a
message
from
the
kutwal
of
calicut
intimating
that
he
and
other
nobles
awaited
him
on
shore
by
order
of
the
zamorin
to
conduct
him
to
the
city
and
that
he
had
permission
to
land
whenever
he
pleased
but
as
the
day
drew
near
a
close
the
general
returned
an
answer
excusing
himself
from
landing
that
night
he
immediately
called
a
council
of
the
other
captains
and
principal
officers
of
the
fleet
to
take
their
advice
on
the
present
emergency
to
whom
he
intimated
his
intention
of
going
to
visit
the
king
of
calicut
on
purpose
to
settle
a
treaty
of
trade
and
amity
paulo
de
gama
his
brother
strongly
objected
to
his
venturing
on
shore
alleging
that
although
the
natives
of
the
place
were
christians
as
they
still
believed
them
yet
there
were
many
moors
among
them
who
were
much
to
be
feared
as
his
mortal
enemies
since
these
people
at
mozambique
and
mombaza
where
they
had
only
passed
by
their
ports
endeavoured
to
destroy
them
all
they
were
much
more
to
be
feared
at
calicut
where
we
had
come
on
purpose
to
enter
into
competition
with
them
in
trade
by
which
their
profits
would
be
diminished
it
was
therefore
the
more
probable
that
they
would
use
every
effort
to
destroy
the
general
on
whom
our
whole
hope
of
safety
and
success
depended
and
however
much
the
zamorin
might
regret
the
commission
of
such
a
deed
he
could
not
restore
him
to
life
besides
which
the
moors
were
inhabitants
of
the
place
where
they
had
much
interest
whereas
the
general
was
an
utter
stranger
likewise
it
was
quite
impossible
for
them
to
be
assured
that
the
king
of
calicut
might
not
have
leagued
with
the
moors
for
his
death
or
captivity
either
of
which
would
ruin
their
voyage
and
prove
the
destruction
of
them
all
and
all
the
toils
and
dangers
they
had
passed
through
would
prove
in
vain
to
prevent
all
this
danger
he
strongly
urged
that
the
general
should
on
no
account
go
on
shore
but
should
depute
one
of
the
captains
or
some
other
person
in
the
fleet
in
his
stead
alleging
that
commanders
in
chief
ought
never
to
subject
themselves
to
personal
danger
unless
in
cases
of
the
most
urgent
necessity
all
the
officers
were
of
the
same
opinion
but
the
general
answered
that
even
if
he
were
perfectly
assured
that
his
landing
were
to
occasion
his
instant
death
he
would
not
refrain
from
going
to
visit
the
king
of
calicut
to
endeavour
to
settle
amity
and
trade
and
that
he
might
procure
some
spices
and
other
commodities
from
the
place
by
means
of
which
their
discovery
of
calicut
might
be
proved
on
their
return
into
portugal
as
otherwise
if
we
returned
without
any
of
the
productions
of
the
indies
their
discovery
would
be
discredited
and
their
honour
and
veracity
called
in
question
think
not
therefore
said
he
but
i
will
rather
die
than
leave
it
in
hazard
that
the
long
time
we
have
already
spent
and
may
yet
employ
shall
be
lost
and
others
sent
to
ascertain
the
truth
of
our
discoveries
while
envious
persons
may
have
it
in
their
power
to
discredit
our
services
neither
do
i
run
into
such
hazard
of
death
nor
expose
you
to
such
dangers
as
you
suppose
seeing
that
i
am
going
to
a
city
inhabited
by
christians
and
to
a
king
who
wishes
the
concourse
of
many
merchants
in
his
dominions
as
the
more
of
these
that
frequent
his
port
so
much
the
greater
must
be
his
revenue
from
the
customs
upon
trade
it
is
not
my
intention
to
stay
long
on
shore
so
as
to
give
opportunity
to
the
moors
to
complot
against
me
as
i
propose
only
to
talk
with
the
king
and
to
return
in
three
days
by
which
time
you
may
have
every
thing
in
readiness
for
our
departure
if
i
should
have
the
good
fortune
by
the
will
of
god
to
establish
trade
and
amity
with
the
king
of
calicut
i
would
not
exchange
the
honour
and
credit
of
that
transaction
for
any
treasure
that
could
be
given
me
neither
can
the
king
of
calicut
settle
this
affair
so
well
with
any
other
person
as
he
will
honour
me
the
more
for
being
the
of
this
fleet
and
the
ambassador
of
our
king
should
any
other
go
in
my
stead
the
king
might
look
upon
himself
as
slighted
and
insulted
under
an
idea
that
i
do
not
esteem
him
worthy
to
be
visited
by
myself
or
that
i
do
not
trust
him
on
his
word
and
assurance
besides
it
is
not
possible
for
me
to
give
sufficiently
ample
instructions
to
any
one
i
might
send
to
enable
him
to
do
what
may
be
necessary
under
every
circumstance
that
may
arise
as
i
myself
might
do
even
if
it
should
chance
that
they
kill
me
it
were
better
this
should
happen
in
the
discharge
of
my
duty
than
that
i
should
preserve
my
life
by
neglecting
to
perform
it
you
my
friends
remain
at
sea
in
good
ships
and
if
you
hear
of
any
mischance
befalling
me
my
desire
is
that
you
shall
immediately
depart
and
carry
home
news
of
our
discovery
as
for
our
present
subject
there
need
be
no
farther
argument
as
i
am
determined
with
the
blessing
of
god
to
proceed
to
visit
the
king
at
calicut
when
this
determination
was
made
known
the
captains
made
no
farther
objections
and
chose
out
twelve
persons
to
accompany
him
among
whom
were
diego
diaz
his
secretary
fernan
martinez
the
interpreter
john
de
sala
who
was
afterwards
treasurer
of
the
indies
and
nine
others
and
paulo
de
gama
his
brother
was
appointed
to
act
as
during
his
absence
the
general
before
going
on
shore
gave
pointed
orders
that
no
person
should
on
any
account
be
permitted
to
come
on
board
the
ships
but
that
all
who
were
desirous
of
any
intercourse
with
them
should
remain
in
their
boats
or
almadias
he
likewise
directed
that
nicholas
coello
should
come
every
day
with
his
boat
well
armed
as
near
the
shore
as
he
could
with
safety
on
purpose
to
keep
up
an
intercourse
between
the
ships
and
himself
all
these
things
being
settled
the
general
went
on
shore
with
his
twelve
attendants
all
in
their
best
attire
their
boat
furnished
with
much
ordnance
dressed
out
with
flags
and
streamers
and
sounding
trumpets
all
the
way
from
the
ships
to
the
shore
on
landing
the
general
was
received
with
every
demonstration
of
respect
by
the
kutwal
attended
by
nayres
and
a
great
concourse
of
natives
both
of
the
country
and
from
the
city
of
calicut
after
compliments
were
passed
the
general
was
placed
in
an
or
litter
which
the
king
of
calicut
had
sent
for
his
use
in
this
country
it
is
not
customary
to
travel
on
horseback
but
in
these
andors
this
vehicle
is
like
a
except
that
they
are
very
plain
with
low
sides
and
are
carried
by
four
men
on
their
shoulders
who
run
post
in
this
manner
carrying
the
king
or
any
noble
person
when
on
a
journey
and
going
at
a
great
rate
the
person
in
the
andor
may
either
sit
or
lie
as
he
pleases
and
certain
servants
carry
umbrellas
which
they
call
to
shelter
the
person
in
the
andor
from
the
sun
and
rain
there
are
other
andors
which
have
a
curved
cane
over
them
like
a
bow
and
are
so
light
that
they
can
be
carried
by
two
men
the
general
being
mounted
in
one
andor
and
the
kutwal
in
another
they
set
out
for
a
town
called
capocate
all
the
rest
being
on
foot
but
the
kutwal
appointed
certain
people
of
the
country
to
carry
the
baggage
of
our
men
which
was
restored
to
them
at
capocate
where
the
party
stopped
for
refreshment
the
general
and
his
people
being
in
one
house
and
the
kutwal
in
another
our
people
were
here
provided
with
boiled
fish
with
rice
and
butter
and
some
of
the
country
fruits
which
are
very
good
though
quite
different
from
ours
one
of
these
fruits
is
called
and
another
mango
and
they
have
figs
likewise
the
water
was
excellent
and
as
good
as
any
in
portugal
after
resting
and
refreshing
themselves
at
capocate
the
general
and
his
suite
were
embarked
in
a
vessel
called
an
consisting
of
two
almadias
lashed
side
by
side
the
kutwal
and
his
train
embarked
in
many
other
boats
and
the
whole
went
up
a
river
which
discharges
itself
into
the
sea
at
this
place
the
numbers
of
people
that
came
to
the
river
side
to
view
our
men
as
they
passed
was
quite
countless
by
which
it
appears
that
the
country
was
well
inhabited
after
going
about
a
league
up
this
river
our
people
came
to
a
place
where
many
large
ships
were
drawn
up
on
the
shore
the
whole
party
here
disembarked
and
proceeded
by
land
the
general
and
kutwal
in
andors
as
before
being
surrounded
by
thousands
who
were
curious
to
see
the
strangers
even
many
women
pressing
into
the
crowd
with
their
children
slung
at
their
backs
from
this
place
the
kutwal
carried
the
general
to
one
of
their
pagodas
or
idol
temples
into
which
they
entered
and
which
the
kutwal
said
was
a
church
of
great
holiness
this
the
general
believed
to
be
the
case
fancying
it
to
be
a
church
of
the
christians
which
he
the
more
readily
believed
as
he
saw
seven
little
bells
hung
over
the
principal
door
in
front
of
this
entry
there
stood
a
pillar
made
of
wire
as
tall
as
the
mast
of
a
ship
on
the
top
of
which
was
a
weathercock
likewise
made
of
wire
this
church
was
as
large
as
a
moderate
convent
all
built
of
freestone
and
covered
or
vaulted
over
with
brick
having
a
fine
outward
appearance
as
if
its
inside
were
of
splendid
workmanship
our
general
was
much
pleased
with
this
church
as
he
actually
believed
himself
in
a
christian
country
and
gladly
entered
along
with
the
kutwal
they
were
received
by
the
priests
who
were
naked
from
the
waist
upwards
having
a
kind
of
petticoats
of
cotton
hanging
down
from
the
girdle
to
their
knees
and
pieces
of
calico
covering
their
their
heads
legs
and
feet
bare
they
were
distinguished
by
wearing
certain
threads
over
their
right
shoulders
which
crossed
over
their
breasts
under
their
left
arms
much
in
the
way
in
which
our
priests
used
formerly
to
wear
their
stoles
when
they
said
mass
these
men
are
called
kafrs
and
are
idolaters
serving
as
priests
in
the
pagodas
of
malabar
and
on
the
general
going
into
the
pagoda
they
took
holy
water
with
a
from
a
font
and
threw
it
over
the
kutwal
and
him
and
their
attendants
after
this
they
gave
them
powdered
sandalwood
to
throw
upon
their
heads
as
used
to
be
done
amongst
us
with
ashes
and
they
were
directed
to
do
the
same
on
their
arms
but
our
people
as
being
clothed
omitted
this
latter
part
of
the
ceremony
complying
with
the
other
in
this
pagoda
they
saw
many
images
painted
on
the
walls
some
of
which
had
monstrous
teeth
projecting
an
inch
from
their
mouths
and
some
had
four
arms
all
of
them
so
ugly
that
they
seemed
like
devils
which
raised
doubts
among
our
people
whether
they
were
actually
in
a
christian
church
in
the
middle
of
the
pagoda
stood
a
chapel
having
a
roof
or
dome
of
freestone
like
a
tower
in
one
part
of
which
was
a
door
of
wire
to
which
there
led
a
flight
of
stone
steps
on
the
inside
of
this
tower
an
image
was
observed
in
a
recess
of
the
wall
which
our
men
could
not
see
distinctly
as
the
place
was
somewhat
dark
and
they
were
not
permitted
to
go
near
as
none
were
allowed
to
approach
except
the
priests
but
from
certain
words
and
signs
our
people
understood
this
to
be
an
image
of
the
virgin
on
which
the
general
and
his
attendants
went
upon
their
knees
to
say
their
prayers
john
de
sala
however
being
very
doubtful
that
this
was
not
a
christian
church
owing
to
the
monstrous
images
on
the
walls
said
as
he
fell
on
his
knees
this
be
the
devil
i
worship
on
which
the
general
looked
at
him
with
a
smile
the
kutwal
and
his
people
as
they
approached
the
chapel
prostrated
themselves
three
times
on
their
faces
with
their
hands
extended
before
them
after
which
they
arose
and
said
their
prayers
standing
from
this
place
they
went
forwards
to
the
city
of
calicut
and
were
taken
at
their
arrival
into
another
pagoda
similar
to
the
former
after
this
on
entering
the
city
the
crowd
was
so
great
that
they
could
hardly
make
their
way
through
the
streets
the
general
was
astonished
to
see
such
multitudes
and
praised
god
for
having
brought
him
in
safety
to
this
city
humbly
beseeching
his
divine
mercy
so
to
guide
him
on
his
way
that
he
might
accomplish
the
objects
of
his
expedition
and
return
safely
into
portugal
at
length
the
pressure
of
the
crowd
became
so
great
that
the
bearers
were
unable
to
get
forwards
and
the
whole
company
were
forced
to
take
shelter
in
a
house
they
were
here
joined
by
the
kutwals
brother
a
nobleman
who
was
sent
by
the
king
to
accompany
the
general
to
the
palace
and
had
many
nayres
along
with
him
the
procession
again
set
out
preceded
by
many
trumpets
and
sacbuts
sounding
all
the
way
and
one
of
the
nayres
carried
a
which
he
fired
off
at
intervals
after
they
were
joined
by
the
kutwals
brother
the
mob
gave
way
for
the
procession
to
pass
and
shewed
as
much
reverence
as
if
the
king
himself
had
been
present
there
went
in
the
procession
at
least
armed
men
and
the
multitudes
of
spectators
in
the
streets
at
the
doors
and
windows
and
on
the
roofs
were
quite
innumerable
the
general
was
well
pleased
at
his
honourable
reception
and
said
pleasantly
to
those
of
his
company
little
think
in
portugal
how
honourably
we
are
received
the
procession
arrived
at
the
palace
an
hour
before
sunset
though
only
constructed
of
earth
the
palace
was
very
extensive
and
seemed
a
handsome
structure
having
great
numbers
of
trees
interspersed
among
the
different
buildings
with
pleasant
gardens
full
of
fine
flowers
and
odoriferous
plants
and
many
fountains
as
the
zamorin
never
goes
out
of
the
palace
while
resident
in
calicut
on
arriving
at
the
palace
several
caymals
and
other
noblemen
came
out
to
receive
the
general
who
led
him
to
a
large
square
immediately
in
front
of
the
gates
whence
they
passed
through
four
several
courts
at
the
gate
of
each
of
which
there
were
ten
porters
who
were
obliged
to
lay
about
them
with
sticks
among
the
people
to
clear
the
way
on
coming
to
the
gate
of
the
house
in
which
the
king
resided
they
were
met
by
the
chief
bramin
or
high
priest
of
the
royal
household
a
little
old
man
who
embraced
the
general
and
conducted
him
and
his
people
into
the
palace
at
this
time
the
people
pressed
forwards
with
much
eagerness
to
get
a
sight
of
the
king
which
they
very
seldom
do
as
he
goes
very
rarely
out
of
the
palace
and
the
multitude
was
so
great
that
some
of
them
were
stifled
in
the
throng
which
would
likewise
have
been
the
case
with
two
of
our
men
if
they
had
not
gone
on
before
with
the
assistance
of
the
porters
who
severely
hurt
many
of
the
mob
and
forced
them
to
make
way
on
passing
the
last
gate
the
general
and
his
attendants
entered
along
with
the
noblemen
into
a
great
hall
surrounded
with
seats
of
timber
raised
in
rows
above
one
another
like
our
theatres
the
floor
being
covered
by
a
carpet
of
green
velvet
and
the
walls
hung
with
silk
of
various
colours
the
king
was
of
a
brown
complexion
large
stature
and
well
advanced
in
years
he
lay
on
a
sofa
covered
with
a
cloth
of
white
silk
and
gold
and
a
rich
canopy
over
his
head
on
his
head
he
had
a
cap
or
mitre
adorned
with
precious
stones
and
pearls
and
had
jewels
of
the
same
kind
in
his
ears
he
wore
a
jacket
of
fine
cotton
cloth
having
buttons
of
large
pearls
and
the
wrought
with
gold
thread
about
his
middle
he
had
a
piece
of
a
white
calico
which
came
only
down
to
his
knees
and
both
his
fingers
and
toes
were
adorned
with
many
gold
rings
set
with
fine
stones
his
arms
and
legs
were
covered
with
many
golden
bracelets
close
to
his
sofa
there
stood
a
gold
shallow
bason
on
a
gold
stand
in
which
was
which
the
king
chewed
with
salt
and
this
last
is
a
kind
of
fruit
about
the
size
of
a
nut
and
is
chewed
all
over
india
to
sweeten
the
breath
and
is
supposed
to
carry
off
phlegm
from
the
stomach
and
to
prevent
thirst
the
king
had
likewise
a
gold
bason
on
a
golden
stand
into
which
he
spat
out
the
betel
when
chewed
and
a
gold
fountain
with
water
for
washing
his
mouth
the
king
was
served
with
betel
by
an
old
man
who
stood
close
to
the
sofa
all
the
others
who
were
in
the
presence
held
their
left
hands
to
their
mouths
that
their
breaths
might
not
reach
the
king
and
it
is
thought
unseemly
for
any
one
to
spit
or
sneeze
in
the
presence
when
the
general
entered
the
hall
in
which
the
king
sat
he
stooped
or
bowed
down
three
times
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
lifting
up
his
hands
as
one
that
praised
god
the
king
immediately
made
signs
for
the
general
to
draw
near
and
commanded
him
to
be
seated
on
one
of
the
seats
and
the
rest
of
the
portuguese
came
forwards
making
similar
reverences
and
were
likewise
commanded
to
sit
down
opposite
the
king
water
was
then
presented
to
all
the
company
to
wash
their
hands
which
was
very
refreshing
for
though
it
was
then
winter
they
were
very
hot
they
were
then
presented
with
figs
and
jakas
and
the
king
was
much
pleased
to
see
them
eat
laughing
at
them
and
conversing
with
the
old
man
who
served
him
with
betel
our
people
being
thirsty
called
for
water
which
was
brought
to
them
in
a
golden
ewer
and
they
were
directed
to
pour
the
water
into
their
mouths
as
it
is
reckoned
injurious
to
touch
the
cup
with
their
lips
they
accordingly
did
as
they
were
directed
but
some
poured
the
water
into
their
throats
and
fell
a
coughing
while
others
poured
it
beside
upon
their
faces
and
clothes
which
much
amused
the
king
after
this
the
king
desired
the
general
by
an
interpreter
to
speak
to
those
who
were
present
as
to
the
purpose
of
his
coming
to
calicut
but
the
general
was
not
satisfied
with
this
and
signified
that
he
was
ambassador
from
the
king
of
portugal
a
powerful
prince
and
that
christian
princes
were
not
used
to
receive
the
embassies
of
other
sovereigns
by
means
of
a
third
person
but
by
themselves
in
person
in
the
presence
only
of
a
few
of
their
principal
persons
and
this
being
the
usage
of
his
country
he
chose
to
deliver
his
message
only
to
the
king
himself
the
king
agreed
to
this
and
commanded
the
general
and
fernan
martinez
who
acted
as
interpreter
to
be
conducted
into
another
chamber
which
was
adorned
with
as
much
magnificence
as
the
first
as
soon
as
the
king
entered
this
chamber
he
took
his
seat
on
a
sofa
attended
only
by
his
interpreter
the
chief
bramin
the
old
man
who
served
him
with
betel
and
the
comptroller
of
his
household
the
king
then
asked
the
general
from
what
part
of
the
world
he
was
come
and
what
were
his
desires
he
answered
that
he
was
ambassador
from
the
king
of
portugal
the
most
powerful
of
the
christian
sovereigns
in
the
west
both
in
extent
of
dominions
numbers
of
people
and
riches
that
he
and
his
predecessors
hearing
that
there
were
christian
kings
and
princes
in
the
indies
of
which
the
zamorin
of
calicut
was
the
chief
were
exceedingly
desirous
of
sending
some
of
their
captains
to
discover
the
way
that
they
might
enter
into
friendship
with
the
king
of
this
country
as
brothers
and
for
this
reason
he
had
been
sent
to
his
highness
not
that
the
king
his
master
had
any
need
of
his
riches
having
abundance
already
and
more
than
was
needed
both
of
gold
and
silver
and
other
valuable
things
that
all
the
former
captains
who
had
been
sent
at
great
charges
upon
this
discovery
after
having
employed
a
year
or
more
in
vain
and
having
consumed
all
their
victuals
had
returned
again
into
portugal
but
that
the
present
king
don
manuel
being
anxious
to
bring
this
great
enterprize
to
a
successful
conclusion
had
entrusted
him
with
command
of
three
ships
well
supplied
with
provisions
commanding
him
not
to
return
to
portugal
without
discovering
the
way
to
the
christian
king
of
calicut
and
would
certainly
order
his
head
to
be
cut
off
if
he
returned
without
fulfilling
his
orders
the
said
king
his
master
had
given
him
two
letters
to
deliver
to
his
highness
which
he
would
present
next
day
as
it
was
now
somewhat
late
when
he
would
convince
his
highness
that
the
king
of
portugal
was
his
friend
and
brother
and
should
request
of
highness
in
confirmation
of
friendship
to
send
an
ambassador
to
the
king
of
portugal
as
was
the
custom
among
christian
princes
the
zamorin
expressed
his
satisfaction
with
this
embassy
and
told
the
general
that
he
made
him
welcome
to
his
capital
and
since
the
king
of
portugal
desired
to
be
his
friend
and
brother
he
would
be
the
like
to
him
and
should
send
an
ambassador
to
him
as
desired
the
zamorin
then
made
inquiry
into
many
circumstances
respecting
portugal
how
far
distant
it
was
from
calicut
how
long
the
general
had
been
upon
the
voyage
and
other
things
and
as
it
grew
late
the
king
allowed
him
to
retire
first
asking
him
whether
he
would
reside
with
the
moors
or
the
malabars
but
as
the
general
chose
rather
to
have
a
house
to
himself
the
king
gave
orders
to
a
moor
who
was
his
factor
to
accompany
him
and
to
provide
him
with
every
thing
necessary
for
his
accommodation
leaving
the
palace
late
it
being
now
towards
ten
the
kutwal
and
the
rest
who
had
accompanied
him
there
escorted
him
back
to
where
he
was
to
lodge
and
as
they
were
on
their
way
all
on
foot
there
fell
such
rain
that
the
streets
ran
in
torrents
insomuch
that
the
factor
gave
orders
to
some
of
the
people
to
carry
our
general
on
their
backs
the
general
was
displeased
at
this
and
at
the
delay
and
asked
angrily
at
the
factor
if
he
meant
to
carry
him
all
night
through
the
streets
the
factor
made
answer
that
he
could
not
do
otherwise
as
the
city
was
large
and
much
scattered
he
then
conducted
him
into
his
own
house
to
rest
for
some
time
and
procured
a
horse
for
him
to
ride
but
as
the
horse
had
no
saddle
the
general
preferred
going
on
foot
at
length
he
was
brought
to
a
very
good
lodging
to
which
his
people
had
previously
brought
all
his
baggage
next
day
being
tuesday
the
general
was
greatly
rejoiced
to
see
so
promising
a
commencement
of
his
business
and
resolved
upon
sending
a
present
to
the
zamorin
upon
which
he
sent
for
the
kutwal
and
the
kings
factor
to
whom
he
shewed
the
present
which
he
proposed
sending
this
consisted
of
four
or
cloaks
of
scarlet
cloth
six
hats
four
branches
of
coral
twelve
a
box
containing
seven
brass
vessels
a
chest
of
sugar
two
barrels
of
oil
and
a
cask
of
honey
the
kutwal
and
factor
laughed
in
derision
at
this
present
saying
that
this
was
no
fit
present
for
their
king
the
poorest
merchant
presenting
one
more
valuable
they
desired
him
rather
to
send
gold
as
the
king
would
accept
of
nothing
else
the
general
was
offended
at
this
saying
if
he
had
been
a
merchant
he
would
have
brought
gold
but
being
an
ambassador
he
had
brought
none
that
what
he
now
offered
were
his
own
goods
and
not
belonging
to
the
king
his
master
who
being
uncertain
if
he
should
ever
reach
calicut
had
given
him
nothing
to
offer
as
a
present
to
the
zamorin
but
at
his
next
coming
knowing
now
certainly
the
route
the
king
his
master
would
send
gold
and
silver
and
otter
rich
articles
to
this
they
answered
that
these
things
might
be
but
it
was
the
custom
of
this
country
for
every
stranger
who
had
speech
of
the
king
to
make
him
a
present
in
proportion
to
the
greatness
of
his
rank
the
general
replied
it
was
very
proper
their
customs
should
be
observed
and
therefore
he
desired
to
send
this
present
which
he
could
not
make
more
valuable
for
the
reasons
already
assigned
and
if
they
would
not
suffer
it
to
be
carried
to
the
king
he
should
send
it
back
to
his
ships
they
answered
he
might
do
so
for
they
would
not
consent
to
have
such
a
present
sent
to
the
king
the
general
much
displeased
said
he
would
go
speak
with
the
king
himself
and
would
then
return
to
the
ships
meaning
to
have
informed
the
king
of
all
that
had
passed
in
regard
to
the
intended
present
this
they
said
was
very
proper
but
as
they
would
be
detained
long
at
court
in
attending
him
they
were
obliged
in
the
mean
time
to
go
upon
other
business
and
would
return
to
escort
him
to
court
as
the
king
would
be
angry
if
he
went
without
them
he
being
an
entire
stranger
and
besides
he
could
not
go
in
safety
unaccompanied
because
of
the
great
numbers
of
moors
who
resided
in
that
city
giving
credit
to
their
words
the
general
consented
to
this
arrangement
and
said
he
would
wait
for
their
return
which
he
expected
would
be
without
delay
but
they
did
not
return
all
that
day
as
they
had
been
gained
over
by
the
moors
to
thwart
the
purposes
of
the
general
the
moors
in
calicut
had
received
information
of
the
transactions
of
the
portuguese
at
quiloa
and
of
the
taking
of
the
off
melinda
and
knowing
that
we
were
christians
were
very
jealous
of
our
arrival
at
calicut
bontaybo
had
told
the
moors
that
our
purpose
was
not
merely
to
discover
calicut
from
curiosity
but
that
spices
were
in
great
estimation
in
portugal
which
abounded
in
gold
and
silver
and
to
which
all
kinds
of
merchandize
was
at
present
transported
that
went
from
calicut
by
way
of
the
red
sea
and
finally
that
the
settlement
of
a
direct
trade
by
the
portuguese
with
calicut
would
tend
greatly
to
the
profit
of
the
zamorin
all
this
the
moors
very
well
understood
but
considering
that
we
were
christians
they
believed
if
we
should
establish
trade
with
calicut
that
their
own
commodities
would
fall
in
price
and
most
of
their
profits
be
destroyed
wherefore
they
consulted
together
how
to
induce
the
zamorin
to
take
the
general
prisoner
to
seize
our
ships
and
to
kill
all
our
men
that
they
might
not
return
into
portugal
with
any
intelligence
concerning
calicut
upon
this
they
associated
themselves
with
some
of
those
who
were
in
greatest
credit
with
the
zamorin
to
whom
they
procured
access
and
represented
to
him
that
he
ought
not
to
be
deceived
by
the
christians
for
the
general
was
no
ambassador
as
he
pretended
but
a
pirate
who
went
about
to
rob
and
plunder
whereever
he
came
they
asserted
having
received
undoubted
intelligence
of
this
from
their
factors
in
africa
where
after
entering
into
a
friendly
correspondence
with
the
who
even
visited
the
general
in
his
ship
gave
him
many
presents
and
provided
him
with
a
pilot
to
bring
him
to
calicut
he
had
battered
the
town
with
his
ordnance
and
killed
several
of
his
subjects
that
he
had
afterwards
taken
some
laden
with
merchandize
treating
the
xeque
and
his
subjects
like
enemies
in
like
manner
they
misrepresented
the
conduct
of
the
general
at
mombaza
and
melinda
turning
every
thing
that
had
occurred
to
his
dishonour
they
reasoned
from
these
misrepresentations
that
he
could
not
be
an
ambassador
sent
to
maintain
peace
and
amity
as
he
would
not
in
that
case
have
been
guilty
of
these
base
hostilities
and
would
assuredly
have
brought
the
king
a
present
worthy
of
the
sovereign
he
pretended
to
come
from
the
king
was
much
amazed
at
this
discourse
and
told
the
moors
that
he
would
consider
and
determine
what
was
proper
for
him
to
do
the
moors
also
told
the
kutwal
of
all
that
they
had
said
to
the
king
with
whom
he
was
in
great
credit
and
requested
of
him
to
persuade
the
king
not
to
listen
to
this
embassage
the
kutwal
then
went
to
the
king
who
told
him
all
that
the
moors
had
said
and
the
kutwal
advised
him
to
do
as
the
moors
had
requested
on
this
the
king
changed
his
good
intentions
towards
the
general
yet
endeavoured
to
conceal
his
purposes
the
moors
then
waited
on
the
general
under
pretence
of
friendship
offering
to
instruct
him
how
best
to
conduct
himself
saying
that
it
was
customary
for
all
persons
who
came
from
other
places
to
calicut
on
business
with
the
king
to
bring
him
a
present
on
this
the
general
shewed
them
the
present
he
had
proposed
making
which
the
kutwal
and
the
factor
had
made
so
light
of
and
with
whom
they
agreed
saying
it
was
by
no
means
a
fit
present
and
would
rather
seem
a
mockery
and
give
offence
even
bontaybo
agreed
in
this
opinion
and
asked
the
general
why
he
had
not
brought
better
things
as
he
knew
that
portugal
abounded
in
all
manner
of
rich
commodities
but
the
general
excused
himself
as
formerly
by
saying
that
it
was
quite
uncertain
whether
he
might
ever
have
come
to
calicut
the
general
remained
the
whole
of
this
day
in
his
lodgings
much
displeased
that
the
kutwal
and
factor
had
not
returned
according
to
promise
and
was
at
one
time
resolved
to
have
gone
to
court
without
them
yet
thought
it
better
to
wait
till
next
day
in
the
afternoon
of
the
wednesday
the
kutwal
and
factor
made
their
appearance
when
he
mentioned
his
dissatisfaction
at
their
long
absence
but
they
talked
of
other
things
and
gave
him
no
answer
on
that
subject
at
length
they
accompanied
him
to
the
palace
but
the
king
having
greatly
changed
his
mind
towards
him
made
him
wait
three
hours
for
admission
and
then
ordered
that
only
two
of
his
people
should
be
admitted
into
the
presence
along
with
himself
though
the
general
considered
this
separation
of
his
people
as
not
looking
well
he
went
into
the
presence
attended
by
fernan
martinez
and
diego
diaz
his
interpreter
and
secretary
the
king
did
not
receive
him
so
well
as
formerly
and
said
with
a
severe
countenance
that
he
had
expected
him
all
the
preceding
day
not
willing
to
give
him
the
true
cause
of
his
absence
lest
it
might
lead
to
a
conversation
respecting
the
present
the
general
said
he
had
tarried
at
home
to
recover
from
the
fatigue
of
his
long
voyage
on
this
the
king
observed
that
he
pretended
to
have
been
sent
on
an
embassy
of
friendship
from
a
rich
and
powerful
king
and
that
he
did
not
well
understand
what
kind
of
friendship
was
intended
since
he
had
sent
him
no
present
to
this
the
general
answered
that
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
that
the
king
his
master
had
sent
no
present
to
his
highness
considering
the
extreme
uncertainty
of
his
being
able
to
come
to
this
place
by
a
way
never
before
attempted
and
unknown
till
now
but
now
that
the
way
was
discovered
and
god
spared
him
to
return
to
portugal
his
master
would
assuredly
send
him
princely
gifts
worthy
of
them
both
and
if
his
highness
would
have
the
goodness
to
give
credit
to
the
letters
which
he
had
brought
from
the
king
his
master
he
would
there
learn
the
intentions
of
the
king
of
portugal
in
sending
him
to
calicut
instead
of
desiring
to
see
the
letters
the
king
asked
him
whether
he
was
sent
in
search
of
stones
or
of
men
and
if
sent
to
discover
men
how
came
it
that
the
king
his
master
had
sent
no
present
and
since
it
was
manifest
that
he
had
brought
him
nothing
he
demanded
of
him
to
send
him
the
golden
image
of
the
virgin
which
he
understood
was
in
his
ship
the
general
much
concerned
to
find
the
king
so
much
changed
towards
him
on
account
of
not
bringing
him
a
present
and
amazed
at
this
strange
demand
said
that
the
image
of
the
virgin
mary
of
which
his
highness
had
been
told
was
only
of
wood
gilt
and
not
of
gold
and
besides
as
this
holy
image
had
protected
him
during
his
long
perils
on
the
sea
and
had
brought
him
so
far
in
safety
he
was
unwilling
to
part
with
it
the
zamorin
made
no
reply
to
this
but
immediately
demanded
that
he
should
produce
the
letters
from
the
king
of
portugal
one
of
these
was
written
in
the
portuguese
language
and
the
other
in
arabic
and
the
general
explained
that
this
had
been
done
because
the
king
his
master
did
not
know
which
of
these
might
be
understood
in
the
dominions
of
his
highness
and
since
he
now
knew
that
portuguese
was
not
understood
in
india
whereas
arabic
was
he
requested
that
some
christian
of
the
indies
who
understood
arabic
might
be
employed
to
interpret
the
letter
because
the
moors
were
known
to
be
enemies
to
the
christians
and
he
was
afraid
lest
they
might
purposely
give
it
a
wrong
interpretation
the
king
gave
orders
to
this
purpose
but
no
indian
could
be
found
who
was
able
to
read
the
letters
or
at
least
who
would
acknowledge
that
he
could
read
them
seeing
that
it
was
now
necessary
that
it
should
be
read
by
the
moors
the
general
requested
that
bontaybo
should
be
one
of
those
appointed
for
the
purpose
placing
more
reliance
on
him
than
the
others
as
he
was
an
acquaintance
the
king
accordingly
commanded
the
letter
to
be
read
by
him
and
other
three
moors
who
having
first
read
it
over
to
themselves
interpreted
it
aloud
to
the
king
to
the
following
effect
as
soon
as
it
became
known
to
the
king
of
portugal
that
the
king
of
calicut
was
one
of
the
mightiest
kings
of
all
the
indies
and
a
christian
he
was
anxious
to
establish
a
treaty
of
amity
and
commerce
with
him
that
he
might
procure
spices
which
were
in
great
abundance
in
his
country
and
to
procure
which
the
merchants
of
many
parts
of
the
world
trade
thither
and
if
his
highness
would
give
a
licence
to
send
for
spices
he
would
send
many
things
from
his
kingdom
which
were
not
to
be
had
in
the
dominions
of
his
highness
or
if
these
things
were
not
satisfactory
of
which
the
general
could
shew
him
some
samples
he
was
willing
to
send
money
both
gold
and
silver
to
purchase
the
spices
and
finally
referring
his
highness
to
the
general
for
farther
information
on
hearing
this
letter
interpreted
and
being
desirous
that
his
revenues
might
increase
by
the
resort
of
many
merchants
to
his
dominions
the
zamorin
evinced
his
satisfaction
at
what
he
had
heard
and
assuming
a
more
friendly
deportment
towards
the
general
asked
him
what
were
the
articles
of
merchandize
that
could
be
had
from
portugal
de
gama
named
many
different
kinds
particularly
mentioning
such
as
he
had
samples
of
along
with
him
and
likewise
their
money
and
requested
permission
to
go
on
board
his
ships
that
he
might
bring
these
things
to
his
highness
offering
to
leave
four
or
five
of
his
men
in
his
lodgings
during
his
absence
giving
now
more
credit
to
the
general
than
to
what
had
been
said
by
the
moors
to
his
prejudice
the
king
told
de
gama
he
might
go
on
board
when
he
pleased
taking
all
his
men
with
him
as
there
was
no
call
for
any
of
them
remaining
on
shore
he
likewise
said
the
general
might
freely
bring
his
goods
on
shore
and
sell
them
to
the
best
advantage
the
general
was
greatly
satisfied
with
this
permission
of
which
he
had
no
hopes
at
the
first
on
seeing
the
unfriendly
reception
he
had
met
with
at
the
commencement
of
his
audience
he
went
back
therefore
to
his
lodging
accompanied
by
the
kutwal
and
the
day
being
near
a
close
he
deferred
returning
on
board
that
night
de
faria
gives
a
somewhat
different
account
of
what
passed
at
this
second
audience
it
was
wonderful
that
the
zamorin
not
knowing
how
to
be
properly
assured
of
the
truth
should
rely
on
the
faith
of
him
who
was
accused
by
his
ministers
for
as
if
he
had
really
known
in
what
detestation
the
portuguese
hold
a
lie
although
to
their
own
advantage
he
sent
for
de
gama
and
told
him
plainly
that
he
had
been
informed
his
embassy
was
all
a
counterfeit
and
that
he
was
some
banished
man
or
a
fugitive
yet
at
the
same
time
offered
even
if
it
were
so
to
give
him
a
kind
reception
and
to
make
him
handsome
appointments
in
his
service
and
promised
to
rely
entirely
on
his
word
for
information
respecting
the
truth
of
the
whole
story
de
gama
heard
the
king
to
an
end
with
a
firm
countenance
and
declared
himself
highly
sensible
of
the
confidence
reposed
in
him
he
then
proceeded
to
answer
all
that
had
been
alleged
against
him
which
he
completely
overturned
by
irrefragable
argument
in
a
long
and
eloquent
speech
preserving
the
utmost
gravity
and
composure
throughout
the
whole
the
zamorin
eyed
him
steadfastly
the
whole
time
hoping
to
be
enabled
to
judge
of
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
his
assertion
by
his
countenance
and
concluded
from
the
unconcernedness
of
his
looks
the
eloquence
of
his
words
and
the
firm
gravity
of
his
whole
demeanour
that
no
deceit
could
lurk
under
such
appearances
of
sincerity
that
the
moors
had
accused
him
maliciously
and
had
imposed
on
his
ministers
he
therefore
frankly
allowed
de
gama
permission
to
return
to
his
ships
and
to
land
his
merchandize
if
he
had
any
saying
that
while
that
was
doing
he
would
prepare
a
satisfactory
answer
to
the
letter
of
the
king
of
portugal
on
the
next
day
being
the
last
of
may
the
kutwal
sent
a
horse
to
the
general
to
carry
him
to
pandarane
but
having
no
furniture
he
requested
to
be
supplied
with
an
which
was
sent
accordingly
when
de
gama
immediately
set
out
for
pandarane
all
his
people
accompanying
him
on
foot
the
kutwal
remained
at
calicut
but
a
considerable
number
of
nayres
escorted
the
general
on
his
way
when
the
moors
learnt
that
the
general
was
gone
to
the
ships
they
went
together
to
the
kutwal
making
large
offers
of
money
to
him
if
he
would
pursue
the
general
and
detain
him
a
prisoner
under
some
feigned
pretence
when
they
would
take
some
opportunity
of
having
him
slain
in
such
way
that
the
blame
should
not
attach
to
the
kutwal
and
when
he
objected
that
the
zamorin
might
punish
him
for
detaining
the
general
contrary
to
his
orders
they
engaged
so
to
deal
with
the
zamorin
as
to
obtain
his
pardon
for
that
offence
induced
by
a
large
bribe
and
encouraged
by
this
promise
the
kutwal
followed
de
gama
in
such
haste
that
he
soon
passed
our
men
who
lagged
behind
on
account
of
the
great
heat
on
overtaking
de
gama
he
asked
by
signs
why
he
was
in
such
haste
and
where
he
was
running
to
the
general
answered
in
the
same
manner
that
he
was
running
to
avoid
the
heat
on
coming
to
pandarane
as
his
men
were
not
come
up
the
general
declined
going
into
the
town
till
they
should
arrive
and
went
into
a
house
to
get
shelter
from
the
rain
the
people
did
not
get
to
the
town
till
near
sunset
having
lost
their
way
on
which
the
general
said
if
it
had
not
been
for
their
absence
he
would
have
been
by
this
time
on
board
the
general
immediately
desired
the
kutwal
to
order
him
to
be
furnished
with
an
almadia
or
pinnace
to
carry
him
and
his
people
on
board
but
the
kutwal
said
it
was
now
late
and
the
ships
so
far
away
that
he
might
miss
them
in
the
dark
for
which
reason
he
had
better
stay
till
next
day
the
general
then
said
if
he
were
not
immediately
furnished
with
an
almadia
he
would
return
to
the
king
and
complain
that
he
was
detained
contrary
to
his
license
and
even
mentioned
as
if
he
meant
to
return
immediately
to
calicut
to
dissemble
the
more
the
kutwal
said
he
might
have
thirty
instead
of
one
if
he
needed
them
and
pretended
to
send
out
to
procure
almadias
while
at
the
same
time
he
commanded
the
owners
to
hide
themselves
that
they
might
not
be
found
in
the
mean
time
while
messengers
were
dispatched
on
pretence
to
seek
almadias
the
general
having
a
strong
suspicion
that
evil
was
intended
towards
him
walked
leisurely
along
the
water
side
and
sent
off
gonzales
perez
and
two
other
mariners
to
go
on
before
and
endeavour
to
find
nicholas
coello
with
his
boats
and
to
caution
him
to
keep
out
of
the
way
lest
the
kutwal
might
send
off
to
seize
his
boats
and
men
while
perez
and
the
others
were
absent
on
this
errand
it
drew
far
into
the
night
and
not
choosing
to
go
off
till
he
learnt
what
success
perez
had
met
with
he
at
length
agreed
to
stay
all
night
having
placed
de
gama
in
the
house
of
a
moor
for
the
night
the
kutwal
pretended
that
he
would
go
in
search
of
the
three
mariners
who
were
absent
but
he
did
not
return
till
next
morning
the
general
then
required
to
have
an
almadia
to
carry
him
and
his
people
on
board
before
answering
the
kutwal
spoke
some
words
to
his
nayres
in
their
own
language
and
then
desired
the
general
to
give
orders
to
have
the
ships
brought
near
the
shore
oh
which
he
should
have
leave
to
depart
on
this
the
general
became
still
more
afraid
that
some
treachery
was
intended
yet
answered
boldly
that
he
would
give
no
such
order
while
he
remained
on
shore
as
that
would
make
his
brother
believe
he
was
a
prisoner
and
had
issued
this
order
under
restraint
on
which
he
would
immediately
depart
for
portugal
without
him
the
kutwal
then
threatened
stoutly
that
he
should
never
be
allowed
to
go
off
unless
he
complied
with
this
demand
the
general
in
return
declared
he
should
immediately
return
to
calicut
if
not
allowed
to
go
on
board
and
make
a
complaint
of
his
conduct
to
the
king
the
kutwal
even
dared
him
to
do
this
yet
took
care
it
should
not
be
in
his
power
as
he
had
ordered
the
doors
to
be
kept
shut
and
guarded
by
armed
nayres
to
prevent
any
of
the
portuguese
from
going
out
yet
it
was
the
will
of
god
that
the
kutwal
dared
not
to
kill
the
general
or
any
of
his
men
although
the
moors
had
bribed
him
with
a
great
sum
of
money
and
notwithstanding
his
great
credit
with
the
zamorin
his
anxiety
to
have
the
ships
brought
near
the
shore
was
that
the
moors
might
be
able
to
board
them
and
kill
all
their
people
and
seeing
it
in
this
light
the
general
was
equally
determined
to
prevent
their
nearer
approach
finding
he
could
not
prevail
on
the
general
to
command
the
ships
to
be
brought
near
the
shore
and
having
no
pretence
to
justify
either
keeping
him
prisoner
or
offering
him
any
wrong
the
kutwal
next
endeavoured
to
persuade
him
to
order
the
sails
and
rudders
on
shore
at
which
the
general
only
laughed
saying
the
king
had
given
full
permission
to
go
on
board
without
any
such
conditions
and
assured
him
the
king
should
be
fully
informed
of
all
his
unjust
proceedings
the
general
and
his
people
now
pretended
to
be
in
want
of
necessaries
from
the
ships
and
requested
leave
to
send
some
of
his
people
on
board
while
he
should
remain
on
shore
but
this
the
kutwal
refused
and
our
people
began
to
be
seriously
alarmed
at
this
time
gonzalo
perez
returned
supposing
the
general
at
liberty
and
that
he
waited
for
him
and
his
companions
perez
informed
de
gama
that
he
had
seen
coello
who
waited
for
him
with
the
boats
near
the
shore
the
admiral
was
exceedingly
anxious
that
the
kutwal
should
not
know
of
this
circumstance
lest
he
might
send
out
a
number
of
armed
almadias
to
capture
them
and
therefore
urged
perez
to
return
secretly
to
give
coello
warning
to
return
to
the
ships
and
keep
constantly
on
the
alert
for
fear
of
an
attack
when
coello
got
this
intelligence
he
immediately
set
off
and
the
kutwal
caused
him
to
be
pursued
by
several
almadias
full
of
armed
men
but
he
made
his
escape
the
kutwal
made
another
attempt
to
induce
the
general
to
order
his
brother
to
bring
the
ships
near
the
shore
but
in
vain
for
the
general
told
him
his
brother
even
if
he
were
to
write
such
an
order
would
not
obey
or
were
he
disposed
to
do
so
the
other
officers
in
the
ship
would
prevent
him
the
kutwal
observed
that
he
could
not
give
credit
to
this
as
he
was
sure
any
thing
he
commanded
would
be
obeyed
but
no
arguments
could
prevail
on
the
general
to
this
measure
which
he
was
satisfied
was
meant
for
facilitating
the
destruction
of
the
fleet
to
gratify
the
moors
the
whole
of
this
day
was
spent
in
this
manner
and
in
the
night
our
people
were
confined
in
a
large
paved
yard
surrounded
with
walls
and
under
even
a
stronger
guard
than
attended
them
during
the
day
and
even
the
general
began
to
fear
as
well
as
the
men
that
they
would
be
separated
from
one
another
yet
he
trusted
when
the
zamorin
should
come
to
know
the
usage
they
had
received
he
would
give
orders
for
their
release
that
night
the
kutwal
came
to
sup
with
the
general
and
sent
a
supply
of
fowls
and
rice
finding
that
he
could
not
prevail
over
the
constancy
of
de
gama
he
determined
at
last
to
set
him
at
liberty
next
day
therefore
being
saturday
the
second
of
june
he
desired
the
general
since
he
had
promised
to
the
king
to
bring
his
merchandize
on
shore
that
he
ought
to
do
so
as
it
was
the
usage
of
all
merchants
who
came
to
calicut
to
land
their
goods
and
crews
and
not
to
return
to
their
ships
till
all
was
sold
and
he
promised
when
this
was
done
to
give
him
free
liberty
to
depart
although
the
general
gave
very
little
credit
to
his
fair
words
he
yet
said
if
the
kutwal
would
provide
almadias
for
the
purpose
he
would
order
his
goods
on
shore
but
was
certain
his
brother
would
not
allow
the
boats
to
leave
the
ships
while
he
was
detained
on
shore
the
kutwal
was
now
content
to
get
the
goods
into
his
power
as
he
understood
from
the
general
they
were
of
great
value
and
allowed
the
general
to
send
off
a
message
to
his
brother
he
therefore
sent
off
a
letter
by
two
of
his
men
in
which
he
gave
his
brother
an
account
of
his
situation
confined
to
his
lodging
but
otherwise
well
used
and
desiring
him
to
send
some
of
the
merchandize
on
shore
to
satisfy
the
kutwal
but
directing
him
in
case
he
was
much
longer
detained
to
believe
that
he
was
kept
prisoner
by
order
of
the
zamorin
whose
only
object
was
to
get
the
portuguese
ships
into
his
power
not
having
time
to
arm
his
own
ships
for
that
purpose
for
this
reason
if
not
set
at
liberty
immediately
after
the
goods
were
landed
he
required
his
brother
to
return
without
delay
to
portugal
and
inform
the
king
of
all
that
had
happened
that
the
trade
of
so
fine
a
country
might
not
be
lost
to
his
country
and
farther
to
inform
the
king
in
what
state
he
remained
trusting
that
his
royal
master
would
send
such
an
armament
as
would
enforce
his
restoration
to
liberty
on
receiving
this
letter
and
a
circumstantial
relation
from
the
messenger
of
all
that
had
happened
on
shore
paulo
de
gama
immediately
sent
the
goods
but
said
in
answer
to
the
general
that
he
could
not
answer
to
his
honour
to
return
to
portugal
without
him
and
he
trusted
god
would
enable
the
small
force
he
had
still
in
the
fleet
with
the
aid
of
his
ordnance
to
compel
the
kutwal
to
liberate
him
on
the
merchandize
being
landed
the
general
delivered
it
over
into
the
custody
of
diego
diaz
as
factor
with
alvora
de
braga
as
his
clerk
whom
he
left
in
a
house
provided
for
them
by
the
kutwal
after
which
he
went
on
board
the
ships
he
then
refused
to
send
any
more
goods
on
shore
till
those
already
there
were
sold
and
paid
for
and
determined
not
to
run
himself
again
into
danger
by
venturing
on
shore
after
what
had
already
past
at
this
the
moors
were
grievously
vexed
as
they
thought
it
more
easy
for
them
to
have
destroyed
him
on
land
than
on
board
the
ships
on
purpose
to
entice
him
to
land
once
more
the
moors
made
a
mock
of
his
goods
pretending
they
were
good
for
nothing
and
did
all
in
their
power
to
prevent
them
from
selling
thinking
that
the
zamorin
knew
nothing
of
all
these
transactions
he
sent
him
an
account
of
the
whole
five
days
afterwards
by
his
factor
of
all
that
had
happened
and
of
the
injurious
conduct
of
the
moors
respecting
the
sale
of
the
goods
the
king
seemed
much
offended
by
these
proceedings
sending
the
general
word
that
he
would
punish
all
those
who
had
used
him
ill
yet
the
kutwal
remained
unpunished
the
king
likewise
sent
seven
or
eight
merchants
of
guzerate
who
were
idolaters
to
buy
the
goods
accompanied
by
an
honest
nayre
to
remain
with
diaz
at
the
factory
to
defend
him
against
the
moors
yet
all
this
was
only
done
colourably
that
the
moors
might
not
appear
to
suborn
the
merchants
for
these
men
bought
nothing
and
even
beat
down
the
price
of
the
commodities
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
the
moors
who
now
boasted
that
no
person
would
buy
our
goods
any
more
than
they
yet
none
of
the
moors
durst
venture
to
our
factory
after
they
heard
a
nayre
was
stationed
there
by
the
kings
order
if
they
did
not
love
us
before
they
hated
us
ten
times
worse
now
and
when
any
of
our
men
landed
they
used
to
spit
on
the
ground
in
contempt
calling
out
portugal
portugal
but
by
the
especial
order
of
the
general
our
people
took
no
other
notice
than
merely
laughing
at
their
insolence
as
none
of
the
merchants
would
buy
our
goods
the
general
supposed
that
this
was
occasioned
by
their
being
lodged
at
pandarane
where
none
of
the
merchants
of
calicut
resided
and
requested
leave
by
a
messenger
from
the
zamorin
to
have
the
goods
removed
to
the
city
this
permission
was
immediately
granted
and
the
king
issued
orders
to
the
kutwal
to
see
them
removed
and
even
to
pay
the
persons
who
carried
them
that
nothing
belonging
to
the
king
of
portugal
might
be
subject
to
any
charges
in
his
country
the
general
would
not
trust
himself
any
more
on
shore
although
bontaybo
who
frequently
came
off
to
visit
him
advised
him
to
wait
on
the
king
lest
the
great
credit
of
the
moors
might
again
prevail
over
his
mind
but
considering
this
man
as
a
moor
the
general
never
put
much
trust
in
him
nor
informed
him
of
his
intentions
yet
always
received
him
kindly
and
gave
him
money
and
other
gifts
that
he
might
bring
him
intelligence
of
what
was
passing
on
shore
after
the
portuguese
merchandize
was
removed
to
calicut
the
general
permitted
one
man
daily
from
each
of
the
ships
to
go
on
shore
to
see
the
city
and
to
purchase
any
thing
they
had
a
mind
for
always
taking
especial
care
that
one
party
returned
on
board
before
another
landed
our
people
were
courteously
received
and
entertained
by
the
natives
and
were
even
lodged
in
their
houses
occasionally
they
bartered
several
things
on
shore
such
as
bracelets
of
brass
and
copper
pewter
and
other
european
articles
for
the
productions
of
the
country
as
freely
and
quietly
as
if
they
had
been
in
lisbon
fishermen
and
others
of
the
idolaters
came
off
to
the
ships
selling
fish
and
poultry
for
biscuit
or
money
while
others
came
off
with
their
children
merely
to
have
a
sight
of
our
ships
on
all
these
occasions
the
general
commanded
them
to
be
well
treated
and
to
have
food
given
them
to
conciliate
the
people
and
to
secure
the
friendship
of
the
zamorin
this
continued
till
the
tenth
of
august
during
which
time
the
ships
had
always
some
of
the
natives
on
board
seeing
the
quietness
of
the
people
and
their
familiarity
with
his
men
who
never
met
with
any
injury
from
the
moors
or
nayres
the
general
believed
the
zamorin
was
willing
to
preserve
friendship
and
peace
with
the
subjects
of
portugal
and
determined
upon
establishing
a
factory
in
calicut
for
the
sale
of
his
commodities
although
very
little
of
what
was
landed
had
as
yet
been
sold
by
this
means
he
hoped
to
lay
a
sure
foundation
for
the
establishment
of
trade
against
the
next
expedition
which
the
king
his
master
might
send
if
god
pleased
to
send
him
home
with
the
intelligence
of
the
discovery
accordingly
with
the
advice
and
concurrence
of
the
captains
and
other
principal
officers
of
the
fleet
he
sent
a
present
by
diego
diaz
to
the
zamorin
consisting
of
scarfs
of
different
colours
silks
corals
and
various
other
articles
diaz
was
desired
to
say
to
the
king
that
the
general
begged
his
highness
to
excuse
his
presumption
in
sending
such
a
present
in
token
of
his
entire
devotion
to
his
service
having
nothing
worthy
of
the
acceptance
of
so
great
a
prince
that
the
time
now
drew
near
when
it
would
be
necessary
to
depart
on
his
return
to
portugal
and
therefore
if
his
highness
meant
to
send
an
ambassador
to
the
king
of
portugal
he
had
better
give
orders
that
he
might
soon
be
ready
to
embark
presuming
upon
what
his
highness
had
already
agreed
to
and
on
the
kindness
hitherto
shewn
to
him
and
his
people
by
his
highness
he
requested
permission
to
leave
a
factor
and
clerk
in
calicut
along
with
his
merchandize
as
a
memorial
of
peace
and
amity
between
his
highness
and
the
king
of
portugal
as
a
testimony
of
the
truth
of
the
embassy
with
which
he
had
been
entrusted
and
in
pledge
of
farther
embassy
from
the
king
his
master
as
soon
as
the
discovery
was
made
known
he
likewise
prayed
his
highness
to
send
on
board
as
a
full
confirmation
of
his
having
actually
made
the
voyage
to
india
a
of
cinnamon
another
of
cloves
and
a
third
of
some
other
spices
which
should
be
paid
for
by
the
factor
out
of
the
first
sales
of
the
goods
in
his
possession
it
was
four
days
after
diaz
received
this
order
before
he
could
get
access
to
the
zamorin
though
he
went
every
day
to
the
palace
for
this
purpose
at
length
he
was
admitted
to
audience
and
on
seeing
diaz
with
his
present
the
king
asked
him
what
he
wanted
in
so
stern
a
manner
that
he
was
afraid
of
being
killed
after
delivering
the
message
from
the
general
and
wishing
to
deliver
the
present
the
king
refused
to
see
it
and
commanded
that
it
should
be
delivered
to
his
factor
the
answer
he
gave
to
the
message
was
that
since
the
general
wished
to
depart
he
might
do
so
but
must
first
pay
him
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
diaz
on
his
return
to
the
factory
with
the
present
intended
for
the
king
was
accompanied
by
many
of
the
nayres
which
he
thought
was
from
respect
but
immediately
on
entering
the
house
the
nayres
remained
at
the
door
forbidding
him
or
any
other
person
to
go
out
after
this
a
proclamation
was
made
through
the
city
forbidding
any
boat
or
almadia
to
go
on
board
our
fleet
on
pain
of
death
yet
bontaybo
went
off
secretly
and
gave
warning
to
the
general
not
to
venture
on
shore
or
to
permit
any
of
the
people
to
land
as
he
had
learned
from
the
moors
that
any
who
might
do
so
would
surely
lose
their
lives
bontaybo
said
farther
that
all
the
fair
words
of
the
king
proceeded
from
dissimulation
that
he
might
entice
the
general
and
his
people
on
shore
to
kill
them
all
all
which
evil
intentions
were
occasioned
by
the
moors
who
made
the
king
believe
that
the
portuguese
were
thieves
and
pirates
who
had
come
to
calicut
to
steal
such
merchandize
as
should
be
brought
there
and
who
had
come
to
spy
out
the
land
that
they
might
return
with
a
great
armament
to
invade
his
dominions
all
this
was
confirmed
by
two
malabar
idolaters
and
the
general
was
in
great
uncertainty
how
best
to
proceed
on
the
present
emergency
that
same
night
after
dark
a
negro
slave
belonging
to
diaz
came
off
with
the
information
that
diaz
and
braga
were
made
prisoners
and
with
an
account
of
the
answer
which
the
king
had
given
to
his
message
what
he
had
ordered
to
be
done
with
the
present
and
of
the
proclamations
which
were
made
through
the
city
diego
diaz
being
anxious
to
have
these
things
communicated
to
the
general
had
bribed
a
fisherman
to
carry
this
man
on
board
as
he
could
not
well
be
recognized
in
the
night
owing
to
his
colour
the
general
though
much
offended
at
these
injurious
proceedings
was
unwilling
to
depart
till
he
might
see
the
end
of
these
things
and
therefore
waited
to
see
whether
anyone
might
come
off
to
the
ships
next
day
being
wednesday
the
of
august
only
one
almadia
came
off
in
which
there
were
four
boys
who
brought
fine
precious
stones
for
sale
although
the
general
believed
they
were
spies
he
received
them
kindly
and
gave
no
hints
of
having
heard
that
diaz
was
made
a
prisoner
expecting
that
others
of
more
importance
might
come
on
board
through
whom
he
might
procure
the
enlargement
of
diaz
and
braga
by
these
boys
he
wrote
to
diaz
but
couched
in
such
a
manner
that
it
might
not
be
understood
if
it
fell
into
any
other
hands
the
letter
was
delivered
according
to
its
direction
and
the
boys
told
the
king
of
their
reception
on
board
by
which
he
believed
that
the
general
knew
not
of
the
imprisonment
of
his
people
on
this
he
sent
off
other
persons
to
the
ships
who
were
strictly
enjoined
not
to
disclose
the
treatment
which
the
factor
had
experienced
this
was
done
out
of
policy
to
deceive
the
general
and
to
detain
our
ships
till
the
king
might
be
able
to
send
his
own
fleet
to
set
upon
him
or
till
the
ships
might
arrive
from
mecca
to
take
him
prisoner
some
of
the
malabars
continued
to
come
off
daily
all
of
whom
the
general
commanded
to
be
well
entertained
as
he
saw
none
of
sufficient
importance
to
be
detained
but
on
the
sunday
six
principal
malabars
came
on
board
attended
by
fifteen
men
in
another
pinnace
believing
that
the
king
would
liberate
diaz
and
braga
in
return
for
these
men
he
made
them
all
prisoners
and
sent
a
letter
in
the
malabar
language
by
two
of
the
native
boatmen
to
the
kings
factors
demanding
his
factor
and
clerk
in
return
for
those
men
he
had
detained
on
board
on
perusal
of
this
letter
the
kings
factor
communicated
the
same
to
the
king
who
commanded
him
to
take
the
portuguese
to
his
own
house
that
he
might
not
appear
to
have
had
any
hand
in
their
detention
and
then
to
restore
them
to
the
general
in
return
for
the
malabars
whose
wives
had
made
a
great
clamour
about
the
detention
of
their
husbands
seeing
that
his
people
were
not
sent
on
board
the
general
weighed
anchor
on
wednesday
the
of
august
and
set
sail
meaning
to
try
if
this
shew
of
going
away
would
have
the
effect
of
recovering
diaz
and
braga
in
return
for
these
malabars
whom
he
had
detained
the
wind
being
contrary
he
came
to
anchor
in
an
open
road
four
leagues
from
calicut
where
the
ships
remained
till
the
saturday
as
there
was
no
appearance
of
getting
back
his
people
de
gama
again
set
sail
but
for
want
of
wind
had
to
come
again
to
anchor
almost
out
of
the
sight
of
land
an
almadia
now
came
to
the
ships
with
certain
malabars
who
said
that
diaz
and
the
others
were
in
the
kings
palace
and
would
be
assuredly
sent
on
board
next
day
not
seeing
the
detained
malabars
these
people
believed
they
had
been
all
put
to
death
this
affected
delay
proceeded
entirely
from
craft
that
they
might
gain
time
to
fit
out
the
calicut
fleet
and
for
the
arrival
of
the
ships
from
mecca
when
their
combined
force
might
environ
and
destroy
the
portuguese
the
general
ordered
these
messengers
to
go
back
to
calicut
and
not
to
return
without
his
men
or
letters
from
them
as
otherwise
he
should
sink
them
and
that
if
a
satisfactory
answer
was
not
sent
him
without
delay
he
would
cut
off
the
heads
of
all
the
malabars
whom
he
had
detained
the
malabars
returned
to
calicut
with
this
message
and
a
wind
springing
up
the
general
made
sail
and
came
to
anchor
off
calicut
about
sunset
next
day
seven
almadias
came
off
to
the
fleet
in
one
of
which
were
diego
diaz
and
alvora
braga
the
others
being
filled
with
many
of
the
natives
these
people
however
were
afraid
to
come
on
board
and
put
diaz
and
braga
into
the
boat
which
was
astern
of
the
generals
ship
and
then
put
off
to
a
little
distance
waiting
for
the
generals
answer
diego
told
the
general
that
when
the
king
learnt
of
his
having
sailed
he
sent
for
him
to
the
palace
assuming
a
pleasant
countenance
as
pretending
to
be
ignorant
of
his
imprisonment
and
asked
him
why
the
general
had
kept
his
subjects
as
prisoners
on
board
on
being
told
the
reason
he
said
the
general
was
in
the
right
he
then
asked
if
his
own
factor
who
was
present
had
extorted
any
presents
for
he
well
knew
that
one
of
his
predecessors
had
been
put
to
death
not
long
before
for
taking
bribes
from
merchant
strangers
after
this
the
king
desired
diaz
to
request
the
general
to
send
him
the
stone
pillar
having
the
cross
and
the
arms
of
portugal
which
he
had
promised
to
set
up
and
to
know
whether
he
would
leave
diaz
as
factor
in
calicut
diaz
likewise
presented
a
letter
for
the
king
of
portugal
which
was
written
on
a
palm
leaf
by
diaz
and
signed
by
the
zamorin
to
the
following
effect
vasco
de
la
gama
a
gentleman
of
thy
house
came
to
my
country
of
whose
arrival
i
was
very
glad
in
my
country
there
is
abundance
of
cinnamon
cloves
pepper
and
precious
stones
the
commodities
i
wish
to
procure
from
your
country
are
silver
gold
coral
and
scarlet
convinced
of
the
duplicity
of
the
zamorin
de
gama
made
no
answer
to
the
message
but
sent
back
all
the
nayres
whom
he
had
detained
desired
them
to
tell
the
king
he
should
return
the
others
who
were
in
custody
on
receiving
back
his
merchandize
he
sent
however
the
stone
pillar
which
had
been
required
on
the
next
day
bontaybo
came
on
board
saying
that
the
kutwal
by
order
of
the
zamorin
had
seized
all
his
property
alleging
that
he
was
a
christian
who
had
come
overland
to
calicut
as
a
spy
from
the
king
of
portugal
bontaybo
said
he
was
sure
this
bad
treatment
had
proceeded
from
the
suggestion
of
the
moors
and
as
they
had
seized
his
goods
he
was
sure
they
meant
personal
violence
on
which
account
he
had
made
his
escape
the
general
gave
him
a
kind
reception
offering
to
carry
him
to
portugal
promising
that
he
should
recover
double
the
value
of
his
goods
besides
that
he
might
expect
to
be
well
rewarded
by
the
king
of
portugal
to
this
arrangement
bontaybo
gladly
consented
and
had
a
good
cabin
assigned
him
by
order
of
the
general
about
ten
the
same
day
three
almadias
full
of
men
came
off
to
the
ships
having
some
scarfs
laid
on
their
benches
as
being
part
of
our
goods
and
these
were
followed
by
four
other
almadias
one
after
the
other
the
malabars
pretended
that
they
had
brought
off
all
the
goods
which
they
offered
to
put
into
his
boat
and
required
him
in
return
to
deliver
up
the
rest
of
the
prisoners
but
convinced
this
was
a
mere
deception
the
general
desired
them
to
go
away
as
he
would
have
none
of
their
merchandize
and
was
resolved
to
carry
the
malabars
to
portugal
as
witnesses
of
his
discovery
he
added
if
god
spared
his
life
he
should
convince
them
whether
the
christians
were
thieves
as
the
moors
had
made
the
king
of
calicut
believe
who
had
therefore
treated
him
with
so
much
injustice
he
now
commanded
several
cannon
to
be
fired
on
which
they
were
afraid
and
made
off
it
was
certain
if
the
kings
ships
had
been
afloat
that
they
would
have
been
sent
to
attack
our
ships
but
they
were
all
hauled
upon
shore
on
account
of
the
winter
season
wherefore
we
may
attribute
it
to
providence
that
our
ships
happened
to
arrive
here
at
this
season
that
thereby
they
might
escape
and
carry
home
news
of
having
discovered
the
indies
to
the
great
advancement
of
the
catholic
faith
although
greatly
rejoiced
at
having
made
the
discovery
of
the
route
to
calicut
and
the
indies
he
was
much
distressed
at
the
behaviour
of
the
zamorin
believing
that
the
next
expedition
that
might
be
sent
out
would
be
subject
to
great
danger
but
as
he
was
unable
to
do
any
thing
more
at
this
time
he
consoled
himself
with
the
knowledge
he
had
thus
acquired
of
the
safe
navigation
and
that
he
had
procured
specimens
of
the
spices
drugs
precious
stones
and
other
commodities
which
were
to
be
procured
at
this
place
having
now
nothing
to
detain
him
here
he
departed
from
calicut
carrying
with
him
the
malabars
whom
he
had
made
prisoners
as
he
hoped
by
their
means
a
good
agreement
might
be
entered
into
with
the
zamorin
on
sending
out
the
next
fleet
from
portugal
on
the
thursday
after
his
departure
being
becalmed
about
a
league
from
calicut
about
sixty
or
boats
of
the
country
came
off
to
the
fleet
filled
with
soldiers
expecting
to
have
taken
all
our
ships
but
the
general
kept
them
off
by
frequent
discharges
of
his
artillery
though
they
followed
him
an
hour
and
a
half
at
length
there
fell
a
heavy
shower
of
rain
attended
with
some
wind
by
which
the
fleet
was
enabled
to
make
sail
and
the
enemies
returned
to
the
land
he
now
proposed
to
direct
his
course
for
melinda
but
made
little
way
along
the
coast
by
reason
of
calms
at
this
time
having
in
mind
the
good
of
the
next
ships
which
might
come
to
calicut
he
thought
fit
to
send
a
soothing
letter
to
the
zamorin
which
was
written
in
arabic
by
bontaybo
in
which
he
apologized
for
having
carried
off
the
malabars
as
evidences
of
his
having
been
at
calicut
he
said
he
was
sorry
that
he
had
left
no
factor
lest
the
moors
might
put
him
to
death
and
that
he
had
been
deterred
by
the
some
cause
from
having
frequently
landed
himself
that
notwithstanding
all
that
had
happened
the
king
his
master
would
be
glad
to
have
the
friendship
of
the
zamorin
and
would
assuredly
send
him
abundance
of
all
those
commodities
he
might
need
and
that
the
trade
of
the
portuguese
to
his
city
would
henceforth
redound
to
his
great
profit
this
letter
was
entrusted
to
one
of
the
malabars
who
was
set
on
shore
and
ordered
to
deliver
it
to
the
zamorin
continuing
his
course
along
the
coast
the
fleet
came
on
the
ensuing
thursday
among
certain
rocky
islands
from
one
of
which
that
was
inhabited
there
came
off
several
almadias
having
fish
and
other
victuals
for
sale
the
general
treated
these
people
kindly
giving
them
shirts
and
other
articles
to
their
great
contentment
and
with
their
approbation
set
up
a
cross
on
the
island
which
was
named
padron
de
sancta
as
soon
as
night
approached
and
the
wind
began
to
blow
from
the
shore
the
fleet
made
sail
always
keeping
near
the
land
on
the
thursday
after
being
the
of
september
they
came
in
sight
of
a
pleasant
high
land
off
which
lay
six
little
islands
where
he
came
to
anchor
going
here
on
shore
in
search
of
fresh
water
a
young
man
was
met
with
who
was
or
pretended
to
be
a
christian
this
person
carried
our
men
to
a
river
where
they
found
a
spring
of
excellent
water
issuing
out
of
the
rock
and
for
his
services
they
gave
him
a
red
nightcap
next
morning
four
natives
came
off
in
a
small
boat
with
many
gourds
and
cucumbers
for
sale
these
people
said
that
their
country
produced
cinnamon
and
two
of
our
people
were
sent
onshore
to
see
whether
this
were
true
who
brought
with
them
two
green
boughs
which
were
said
to
be
cinnamon
of
which
they
had
seen
a
large
grove
but
it
turned
out
only
to
be
the
wild
kind
at
their
return
these
men
were
accompanied
by
more
than
twenty
natives
who
brought
hens
gourds
and
cows
milk
for
sale
and
who
said
if
the
general
would
send
some
of
his
men
on
shore
he
might
have
abundance
of
dried
cinnamon
hogs
and
poultry
but
he
dreaded
treachery
and
would
not
allow
any
of
his
people
to
go
on
shore
next
forenoon
when
some
of
our
men
went
to
a
part
of
the
shore
at
some
distance
from
the
ships
to
cut
wood
they
suddenly
came
in
sight
of
two
boats
lying
close
to
the
land
and
returned
with
intelligence
of
what
they
had
seen
but
the
general
would
not
send
to
inquire
what
these
might
be
until
after
dinner
in
the
mean
time
one
of
the
men
in
the
top
gave
notice
that
he
saw
eight
large
ships
out
at
sea
which
were
then
becalmed
the
general
gave
immediate
orders
to
have
every
thing
in
readiness
in
case
of
an
attack
and
as
the
wind
served
both
fleets
they
soon
came
within
two
leagues
of
each
other
the
enemies
perceiving
our
fleet
approaching
fled
towards
the
shore
but
one
of
their
rudders
breaking
the
men
belonging
to
that
ship
escaped
in
their
boats
and
coello
immediately
took
possession
expecting
to
find
it
laden
with
rich
commodities
nothing
was
found
however
except
and
a
kind
of
sugar
called
which
is
prepared
from
palms
or
date
trees
he
also
found
on
board
many
bows
and
arrows
swords
spears
and
targets
the
other
seven
ships
were
run
aground
so
that
our
ships
could
not
get
near
them
as
drawing
too
much
water
but
our
people
followed
in
their
boats
and
drove
them
out
of
their
vessels
by
firing
upon
them
with
their
ordnance
next
day
while
our
fleet
was
at
anchor
seven
men
came
off
from
the
land
in
an
almadia
who
reported
that
these
eight
ships
had
been
sent
by
the
zamorin
from
calicut
to
capture
our
fleet
as
they
had
been
informed
by
some
of
the
fugitives
from
this
place
the
general
removed
to
the
island
of
at
a
short
distance
where
he
was
told
he
might
procure
good
water
this
island
is
very
small
and
only
a
league
from
the
continent
it
contains
several
woods
and
two
cisterns
or
conduits
built
of
freestone
one
of
which
is
six
feet
deep
supplied
with
excellent
water
from
certain
springs
and
the
sea
around
has
great
quantities
of
fish
before
the
moors
traded
with
india
this
island
was
well
inhabited
by
the
native
idolaters
having
many
goodly
buildings
and
especially
some
fine
pagodas
but
when
the
moors
resorted
to
this
coast
from
the
red
sea
they
used
to
take
in
their
wood
and
water
at
this
place
and
abused
the
inhabitants
so
intolerably
that
they
abandoned
the
place
and
pulled
down
most
of
their
pagodas
and
all
their
other
buildings
these
gentiles
were
natives
of
that
part
of
the
continent
which
belongs
to
the
king
of
and
used
often
to
repair
thither
to
perform
their
devotions
to
three
black
stones
which
were
in
a
chapel
of
one
of
the
pagodas
which
still
remains
this
island
is
called
in
the
malabar
language
which
signifies
the
five
islands
and
is
so
named
because
there
are
other
four
islands
round
about
coming
to
anchor
here
the
general
sent
coello
on
shore
with
an
armed
escort
to
examine
the
country
and
to
see
if
there
were
any
convenient
place
for
their
ships
bottoms
as
they
had
been
long
at
sea
and
had
a
long
run
before
them
every
thing
being
found
convenient
and
the
measure
approved
of
by
all
the
captains
it
was
determined
to
lay
their
ships
successively
aground
for
this
purpose
the
ship
called
the
berrio
was
first
laid
on
shore
and
while
occupied
in
repairing
and
cleaning
her
bottom
many
of
the
natives
came
off
from
the
continent
to
sell
victuals
to
our
people
while
this
was
going
forwards
two
small
brigandines
were
seen
rowing
towards
our
ships
ornamented
with
flags
and
streamers
on
their
masts
beating
drums
and
sounding
trumpets
and
filled
with
men
who
plied
their
oars
at
the
same
time
five
similar
vessels
were
seen
creeping
along
shore
as
if
lying
by
to
help
the
others
if
needful
the
malabars
who
supplied
our
people
with
provisions
warned
the
general
to
beware
of
these
vessels
which
belonged
to
pirates
who
roamed
about
in
these
seas
robbing
all
they
met
under
pretence
of
peace
the
general
believed
he
might
have
taken
these
two
vessels
if
he
had
allowed
them
to
come
close
up
with
his
ships
but
did
not
choose
to
run
any
risk
wherefore
as
soon
as
they
came
within
he
ordered
all
the
cannon
belonging
to
the
two
ships
which
remained
afloat
to
be
fired
at
them
on
which
calling
out
in
a
loud
voice
tambarane
which
is
their
name
for
god
they
fled
away
nicholas
coello
who
was
in
his
boat
followed
after
them
firing
off
his
ordnance
but
the
general
fearful
of
any
mischance
called
him
back
by
signal
next
day
when
the
general
and
all
his
men
were
on
shore
at
work
upon
the
berrio
twelve
natives
who
appeared
to
be
men
of
some
consequence
came
to
the
island
in
two
small
and
presented
a
bundle
of
sugar
canes
these
people
asked
permission
to
go
on
board
the
ships
as
they
had
never
seen
any
such
before
but
the
general
was
much
offended
with
this
fearing
they
might
be
spies
while
engaged
in
conversation
with
these
men
other
two
made
their
appearance
having
as
many
men
but
those
who
came
first
seeing
the
general
displeased
advised
these
new
comers
not
to
land
when
the
berrio
was
repaired
the
generals
ship
was
brought
aground
to
receive
the
same
attentions
while
the
general
and
the
other
captains
were
on
shore
busied
in
the
repairs
of
the
san
michael
there
came
one
day
a
man
in
a
little
seemingly
about
forty
years
old
and
not
of
that
country
as
he
was
dressed
in
a
or
gown
of
fine
cotton
reaching
to
his
heels
his
head
covered
with
a
kerchief
or
towel
which
partly
covered
his
face
and
wearing
a
faulchion
or
crooked
cymeter
at
his
girdle
immediately
on
landing
he
went
up
and
embraced
the
general
as
if
he
had
seen
or
known
him
before
and
treated
the
other
captains
with
the
same
politeness
he
told
them
he
was
a
christian
born
in
italy
and
had
been
brought
when
a
child
into
the
indies
that
he
now
dwelt
with
a
moorish
lord
named
who
ruled
a
certain
island
called
goa
about
twelve
leagues
from
thence
and
who
had
horsemen
on
that
island
that
as
his
dwelling
was
now
among
the
moors
he
conformed
externally
to
their
worship
though
in
his
heart
a
christian
that
learning
certain
men
had
come
in
ships
to
calicut
such
as
had
never
been
seen
before
in
the
indies
and
that
no
one
understood
their
language
he
immediately
understood
that
they
must
be
for
so
the
christians
are
named
in
the
indies
that
he
was
desirous
of
seeing
them
and
had
asked
leave
of
to
come
and
visit
them
which
if
he
had
not
obtained
he
would
have
died
of
vexation
that
sabayo
had
not
only
granted
him
leave
for
this
purpose
but
desired
if
he
found
the
strangers
to
be
from
his
country
to
offer
them
any
thing
they
might
stand
in
need
of
which
his
country
produced
particularly
spices
and
provisions
and
besides
if
they
would
come
and
live
with
him
sabayo
would
entertain
them
honourably
and
give
them
sufficient
to
live
on
the
general
asked
many
questions
concerning
the
country
of
sabayo
and
other
things
to
which
he
made
answer
after
which
he
requested
to
have
a
cheese
from
the
general
to
send
on
shore
to
a
companion
as
a
token
of
having
been
well
received
the
general
suspected
some
mystery
in
this
man
yet
ordered
a
cheese
and
two
new
loaves
to
be
given
him
which
he
sent
away
to
his
companion
he
continued
talking
with
great
volubility
and
sometimes
so
unguardedly
as
to
raise
suspicions
of
his
being
a
spy
on
this
paulo
de
la
gama
who
particularly
suspected
him
inquired
of
some
of
the
natives
if
they
knew
who
this
man
was
they
immediately
told
him
he
was
a
pirate
who
had
boarded
many
other
ships
while
laid
aground
on
receiving
this
information
the
general
ordered
him
to
be
carried
on
board
his
ship
then
aground
and
to
be
whipped
well
till
he
should
confess
whether
all
that
he
had
said
was
true
or
false
also
what
was
his
purpose
in
coming
thither
and
whether
he
were
actually
a
moor
or
a
christian
he
still
insisted
that
he
was
a
christian
and
that
all
he
said
was
true
declaring
the
information
given
by
the
natives
to
be
entirely
groundless
the
general
now
ordered
a
more
cruel
torment
to
be
inflicted
to
extort
confession
causing
him
to
be
hoisted
up
and
down
by
the
members
when
at
length
he
declared
he
would
tell
the
truth
he
then
acknowledged
himself
a
spy
sent
to
discover
how
many
men
the
general
had
and
what
were
their
weapons
as
he
was
much
hated
on
all
that
coast
for
being
a
christian
and
that
many
or
foists
were
placed
in
all
the
bays
and
creeks
of
the
coast
to
assail
him
but
dared
not
till
they
were
joined
by
forty
large
armed
vessels
that
were
getting
ready
to
fall
upon
him
but
he
said
he
knew
not
certainly
when
these
vessels
might
be
ready
the
general
now
ordered
him
to
be
confined
under
hatches
intending
to
carry
him
into
portugal
as
a
fit
person
to
give
the
king
his
master
intelligence
respecting
the
indies
and
ordered
him
to
get
refreshing
victuals
and
that
his
cure
should
be
looked
well
after
on
receiving
this
information
of
the
designs
of
his
enemies
the
general
would
stay
no
longer
than
was
necessary
for
completing
the
repairs
of
his
own
ship
which
was
got
ready
in
ten
days
about
this
time
the
general
was
offered
for
the
ship
which
had
been
taken
by
coello
but
he
refused
to
sell
any
thing
to
his
enemies
and
ordered
her
to
be
burnt
when
the
generals
ship
was
ready
and
the
fleet
had
taken
in
a
supply
of
water
they
departed
from
the
island
of
or
anchediva
on
the
of
october
steering
directly
out
to
sea
on
their
course
for
melinda
after
sailing
about
leagues
from
that
island
the
moor
whom
they
had
taken
prisoner
seeing
no
prospect
of
escape
now
made
a
full
and
true
confession
he
acknowledged
that
he
lived
with
sabayo
the
lord
of
goa
to
whom
word
was
brought
that
the
general
was
wandering
about
in
those
seas
like
one
who
knew
not
where
he
was
upon
which
orders
were
given
to
fit
out
a
powerful
fleet
to
make
him
prisoner
in
the
mean
time
learning
that
the
general
was
at
the
isle
of
anchediva
sabayo
commanded
him
to
go
thither
to
visit
him
to
get
intelligence
of
his
strength
and
intentions
and
to
endeavour
to
entice
him
to
goa
where
it
was
sabayos
intentions
to
make
him
and
all
his
people
prisoners
and
to
employ
them
in
his
wars
against
the
neighbouring
princes
as
they
were
reported
to
be
valiant
men
after
this
confession
the
general
gave
this
man
better
treatment
allowing
him
both
clothes
and
money
some
time
afterwards
he
became
a
christian
by
the
name
of
gaspar
de
la
gama
taking
his
name
of
gaspar
from
one
of
the
three
kings
of
the
magi
and
his
surname
from
the
general
who
stood
at
his
baptism
the
general
pursued
his
course
for
melinda
where
he
proposed
to
take
on
board
an
ambassador
from
the
xeque
of
that
place
in
the
early
part
of
this
voyage
he
endured
severe
storms
and
contrary
winds
which
were
succeeded
by
calms
during
which
the
heat
of
the
sun
was
quite
insufferable
and
the
voyage
much
delayed
insomuch
that
water
began
to
grow
scarce
and
the
people
had
to
be
put
on
short
allowance
owing
to
these
circumstances
the
people
were
afflicted
with
the
same
disease
in
their
gums
from
which
they
had
formerly
suffered
such
great
distress
in
the
river
of
good
signs
on
the
outward
voyage
their
arms
and
legs
also
swelled
and
many
tumours
broke
out
over
their
bodies
proceeding
from
a
pestilent
stinking
humour
which
threw
them
into
a
flux
of
which
thirty
persons
died
from
the
continuance
of
calms
and
contrary
winds
and
the
mortality
among
the
people
the
whole
company
became
amazed
and
believed
they
should
never
be
able
to
get
out
from
their
present
distressing
situation
insomuch
that
they
solicited
the
general
to
return
to
calicut
or
some
other
part
of
india
and
submit
to
what
god
might
appoint
rather
than
to
die
on
the
sea
of
these
terrible
diseases
for
which
there
was
no
remedy
especially
as
both
provisions
and
water
began
to
fail
de
gama
reasoned
with
them
to
little
purpose
as
they
had
been
now
four
months
at
sea
and
there
hardly
remained
sixteen
persons
in
each
ship
able
to
do
duty
some
of
whom
even
were
afflicted
with
the
diseases
of
which
the
others
had
died
it
is
even
said
that
paulo
de
la
gama
and
nicholas
coello
had
agreed
to
return
to
india
if
any
wind
should
spring
up
that
would
have
served
for
the
voyage
at
length
a
favourable
wind
sprung
up
unexpectedly
and
in
sixteen
days
they
came
in
sight
of
land
on
wednesday
the
of
february
at
which
the
mariners
were
much
rejoiced
and
soon
forgot
all
their
past
troubles
and
dangers
as
they
came
near
the
land
towards
evening
the
general
gave
orders
to
keep
their
heads
out
to
sea
during
the
night
to
avoid
rocks
or
shoals
as
there
were
no
person
on
board
who
knew
where
they
were
a
moor
alleged
they
had
steered
direct
for
mozambique
saying
there
were
certain
islands
leagues
from
the
shore
and
directly
over
against
that
place
where
the
natives
were
continually
subject
to
the
disease
which
had
been
so
fatal
to
our
men
when
morning
came
they
stood
towards
the
land
when
they
came
before
a
large
and
goodly
city
surrounded
with
walls
having
fair
and
lofty
houses
and
a
large
palace
on
a
height
in
the
middle
of
the
city
seeming
to
be
a
magnificent
building
this
city
is
called
magadoxo
and
stands
on
one
side
of
the
gulf
of
india
on
the
coast
of
ethiopia
an
hundred
and
thirteen
leagues
from
melinda
the
situation
of
which
i
shall
explain
hereafter
knowing
this
to
be
a
city
of
the
moors
he
would
not
stop
at
this
place
but
commanded
many
shots
of
ordnance
to
be
fired
as
he
sailed
past
not
being
sure
how
far
it
was
to
melinda
and
fearing
to
overshoot
that
port
he
lay
too
every
night
and
on
saturday
the
of
february
lying
over
against
a
village
of
the
moors
named
pate
leagues
from
magadoxo
there
came
off
eight
or
boats
of
that
country
filled
with
soldiers
and
making
direct
for
our
fleet
from
whence
we
shot
off
so
many
pieces
of
ordnance
that
they
soon
fled
back
to
the
shore
and
our
people
could
not
follow
for
want
of
wind
next
monday
being
the
of
february
the
fleet
arrived
at
melinda
the
king
immediately
sent
off
his
congratulations
to
the
general
on
his
arrival
with
a
present
of
fresh
provisions
de
gama
sent
fernan
martinez
on
shore
to
return
the
compliments
of
the
king
to
whom
he
sent
a
present
on
account
of
the
great
number
of
sick
on
board
the
fleet
stopped
here
for
ten
days
during
which
time
he
caused
a
mark
to
be
erected
on
shore
with
leave
of
the
king
as
a
token
of
friendship
having
provided
provisions
and
water
for
the
ships
at
this
place
he
departed
on
the
morning
of
wednesday
the
of
february
taking
with
him
an
ambassador
from
the
king
of
melinda
to
negotiate
a
treaty
of
perpetual
peace
and
friendship
with
the
king
of
portugal
considering
that
there
were
not
sufficient
men
remaining
for
navigating
all
the
ships
the
general
and
the
other
captains
agreed
to
burn
one
of
them
and
the
san
rafael
was
chosen
to
be
sacrificed
because
she
was
all
open
and
had
not
been
brought
aground
at
anchediva
when
the
other
two
were
repaired
accordingly
after
taking
out
all
her
stores
and
merchandize
which
employed
them
during
five
days
she
was
burnt
at
certain
shoals
called
the
shoals
of
st
raphael
during
these
five
days
the
fleet
procured
a
considerable
quantity
of
hens
from
a
village
on
the
coast
called
leaving
this
place
the
two
remaining
ships
came
on
the
february
to
the
island
of
zenziber
which
is
in
six
degrees
of
latitude
at
ten
leagues
distance
from
the
continent
this
is
a
considerable
island
having
other
two
in
its
neighbourhood
one
called
and
the
other
these
islands
are
very
fertile
having
abundance
of
provisions
and
great
quantities
of
oranges
the
inhabitants
are
moors
who
are
by
no
means
warlike
and
have
few
weapons
but
are
well
clothed
in
silk
and
cotton
vestments
which
they
purchase
at
mombaza
from
the
merchants
of
cambaya
the
women
are
ornamented
with
jewels
of
gold
and
silver
the
former
being
procured
at
sofala
and
the
latter
from
the
island
of
st
lawrence
or
madagascar
each
of
these
three
islands
has
a
separate
king
who
with
all
their
subjects
are
of
the
mahometan
religion
when
the
king
of
the
island
of
zenziber
was
informed
of
the
arrival
of
our
ships
he
sent
immediately
to
compliment
the
general
accompanied
with
great
presents
of
the
fruits
and
other
productions
of
the
country
and
requested
his
friendship
to
which
the
general
gladly
agreed
and
sent
suitable
answers
after
remaining
here
eight
days
for
refreshments
the
general
departed
on
the
of
march
and
came
to
anchor
beside
the
isle
of
st
george
in
the
bay
of
mozambique
next
day
he
caused
a
mark
to
be
erected
on
this
island
where
he
went
on
shore
and
heard
mass
and
departed
thence
without
any
intercourse
with
the
inhabitants
of
mozambique
on
the
of
march
he
came
to
the
island
of
st
blas
where
the
ships
remained
for
some
time
to
take
in
water
and
to
provide
a
stock
of
sea
wolves
and
which
were
salted
to
serve
as
provision
for
the
remainder
of
the
voyage
and
for
which
they
were
most
thankful
to
god
departing
from
thence
they
were
driven
back
by
a
westerly
wind
right
contrary
but
providence
sent
them
a
fair
wind
by
means
of
which
they
doubled
the
cape
of
good
hope
with
infinite
pleasure
on
the
of
march
all
the
remainder
of
the
crews
being
now
strong
and
in
good
health
with
the
cheering
prospect
of
speedily
returning
to
lisbon
they
now
had
a
fair
wind
which
lasted
them
twenty
days
and
sped
them
on
towards
st
jago
the
fair
wind
now
failed
them
and
delayed
their
voyage
trying
the
lead
on
thursday
the
of
april
they
found
fathom
and
the
least
water
they
had
all
that
day
was
twenty
fathom
on
which
account
the
pilots
concluded
they
were
on
the
shoals
of
the
rio
grande
of
the
rest
of
this
voyage
till
the
arrival
of
the
general
at
the
island
of
st
jago
i
have
found
no
account
except
that
when
approaching
that
place
nicholas
coello
parted
company
one
night
with
the
general
and
made
direct
for
portugal
that
he
might
carry
the
first
intelligence
to
the
king
of
the
discovery
of
india
and
arrived
at
on
the
of
july
he
went
immediately
to
the
king
whom
he
informed
of
all
that
had
befallen
the
general
in
his
discovery
of
the
indies
and
of
the
commodities
which
had
been
brought
from
thence
of
which
discovery
and
of
the
prospect
which
it
held
out
of
a
direct
trade
with
india
by
sea
the
king
was
as
glad
as
when
he
had
been
proclaimed
king
of
portugal
after
the
separation
of
coello
de
gama
pursued
his
voyage
for
the
island
of
st
jago
both
because
his
brother
paulo
was
sick
with
consumptive
complaints
and
because
his
ship
was
in
very
bad
condition
all
her
seams
being
open
at
that
island
he
freighted
a
caravel
in
hope
of
being
able
to
get
his
brother
home
to
portugal
and
left
john
de
sala
in
charge
of
his
own
ship
to
have
her
repaired
and
new
rigged
before
proceeding
for
lisbon
the
general
and
his
brother
left
st
jago
in
the
hired
caravel
for
lisbon
but
the
disease
of
paulo
de
gama
increased
so
rapidly
that
he
was
forced
to
put
in
at
the
island
of
tercera
where
paulo
de
gama
departed
this
life
like
a
good
christian
and
a
worthy
gentleman
when
he
had
buried
his
brother
vasco
de
gama
set
sail
for
portugal
and
arrived
at
belem
in
september
having
been
two
years
and
two
months
absent
on
this
voyage
of
men
whom
he
had
taken
with
him
only
fifty
came
home
alive
which
was
a
large
proportion
considering
the
great
and
numerous
dangers
they
had
gone
through
when
the
general
had
returned
thanks
to
god
for
his
preservation
and
success
he
sent
notice
of
his
arrival
to
the
king
who
sent
diego
de
sylva
y
menesis
lord
of
portugalete
and
many
other
gentlemen
to
conduct
him
honourably
to
court
which
they
did
through
a
prodigious
concourse
of
people
eager
to
see
the
man
who
had
made
so
wonderful
a
voyage
and
whom
they
had
long
thought
dead
being
come
into
the
presence
the
king
honoured
him
as
one
who
by
the
discovery
of
the
indies
had
done
so
much
for
the
glory
of
god
for
the
honour
and
profit
of
the
king
of
portugal
and
for
the
perpetual
fame
of
the
portuguese
name
in
the
world
the
king
made
him
afterwards
a
knight
and
gave
him
and
his
heirs
permission
to
bear
the
royal
arms
of
portugal
as
also
to
set
at
the
foot
of
the
escutcheon
two
does
which
are
called
gamas
in
the
portuguese
language
he
also
gave
him
a
perpetual
pension
or
of
rees
yearly
out
of
the
tythe
fish
in
the
village
of
in
which
he
was
born
and
a
promise
of
being
made
lord
of
that
village
and
till
these
grants
were
executed
in
form
he
allowed
him
crowns
which
after
the
royal
grants
were
made
reverted
to
the
house
of
the
of
the
indies
it
was
also
granted
that
when
the
trade
with
india
should
be
established
he
might
bring
home
spices
to
the
value
of
ducats
yearly
without
paying
any
duty
he
also
gave
him
other
possessions
and
rents
and
a
note
of
remembrance
or
promise
to
make
him
a
lord
nicholas
coello
was
promoted
to
be
a
gentleman
of
the
royal
household
and
received
possessions
and
rents
to
bear
his
charges
the
king
himself
in
consequence
of
these
discoveries
assumed
the
new
title
of
of
the
conquest
and
navigation
of
ethiopia
arabia
persia
and
the

mr
clarke
this
person

named

nunez
mr
clarke
alleges
that
lichefield
our
original
translator
has
fallen
into
an
error
in
this
date
which
ought
to
have
been
the
e
if
saturday
were
the
july
on
which
the
fleet
sailed
from
lisbon
the
of
august
must
have
been
on
thursday
but
it
does
not
seem
necessary
to
insist
upon
such
minute
critical
accuracy
which
besides
is
e
this
strange
expression
probably
means
that
gama
stretched
directly
across
the
gulf
of
guinea
not
creeping
as
usual
along
the
coast
and
endeavoured
to
make
a
direct
course
for
the
cape
of
good
e
our
old
english
translator
lichefield
strangely
mistakes
in
calling
this
place
the
of
sancta
haelena
which
is
assuredly
st
elena
bay
in
lat
it
has
since
been
sometimes
named
st
bay
but
the
proper
and
general
name
is
the
bay
of
st
elena
the
point
of
entry
being
called
st
martin
e
perhaps
the
berg
river
at
the
bottom
of
st
elena
e
this
paragraph
is
added
to
relation
of
castenada
from
the
works
of
faria
and
clarke
if
the
thursday
on
which
they
came
in
sight
of
the
cape
were
the
the
wednesday
following
must
have
been
the
of
the
e
this
paragraph
is
an
addition
to
the
text
of
castaneda
from
osorius
clarke
i
from
the
circumstances
in
the
text
this
of
st
blaze
is
probably
what
is
now
called
st
katherines
or
st
sebastians
bay
yet
that
place
hardly
exceeds
portuguese
leagues
east
from
the
cape
the
sixty
leagues
of
the
text
would
carry
us
almost
a
degree
farther
east
to
what
is
now
called
kaffercroyts
river
clarke
removes
this
place
still
farther
to
flesh
bay
otherwise
called
angra
de
st
braz
or
aguada
de
st
braz
by
de
barros
this
latter
place
is
seventy
portuguese
leagues
or
above
eighty
marine
leagues
east
from
the
cape
this
account
seems
erroneous
whether
st
katherines
or
flesh
bay
be
the
one
in
question
as
both
ought
to
be
safe
in
north
winds
and
the
winds
between
the
s
and
e
points
give
both
a
lee
e
probably
a
species
of
penguins
lichefield
calls
them
as
large
as
ducks
osorius
says
the
natives
called
them
and
that
they
were
as
big
as
e
probably
rock
point
forming
the
western
boundary
of
algoa
or
zwartkops
bay
in
long
bring
the
rocky
extreme
promontory
of
the
krakakamma
e
it
is
infinitely
difficult
to
guess
the
course
of
these
early
voyages
without
latitudes
or
longitudes
and
only
estimated
distances
by
dead
reckoning
in
uncertain
leagues
but
the
rio
del
infante
of
this
voyage
and
that
of
diaz
is
probably
that
now
called
river
in
the
zuureveld
of
graaff
reynet
in
long
which
however
is
portuguese
leagues
or
thirty
geographical
leagues
from
rocky
point
instead
of
the
fifteen
leagues
of
the
e
the
sixty
leagues
in
the
text
are
inexplicable
on
any
rational
supposition
as
they
seem
to
have
again
made
the
rocks
de
la
cruz
or
rather
rocky
point
said
just
before
to
be
only
fifteen
leagues
from
infante
river
to
which
they
were
then
e
the
portuguese
ships
appear
to
have
been
now
on
the
coast
of
natal
or
the
land
of
the
caffres
certainly
a
more
civilized
people
than
the
hottentots
of
the
cape
but
the
circumstance
of
alonzo
understanding
their
language
is
quite
inexplicable
as
he
could
hardly
have
been
lower
on
the
western
coast
than
minz
or
perhaps
congo
yet
as
a
belt
of
caffres
are
said
to
cross
the
continent
of
africa
to
the
north
of
the
hottentots
it
is
barely
possible
that
some
caffre
slaves
may
have
reached
the
western

this
grain
was
probably
what
is
now
well
known
under
the
name
of

according
to
barros
da
boa
clarke
gibb
orosius

the
text
here
ought
probably
to
be
thus
amended
he
and
his
brother
nicholas
coelle
these
probably
swam
off
to
the
e
de
faria
alleges
that
the
people
of
this
river
were
not
so
black
as
the
other
africans
and
wore
habits
of
different
kinds
of
stuffs
both
cotton
and
silk
of
various
colours
and
that
they
understood
arabic
and
adds
that
they
informed
de
gama
there
were
white
people
to
the
eastwards
who
sailed
in
ships
like
those
of
the
portuguese
osorius
likewise
says
that
one
of
the
natives
spoke
arabic
very
imperfectly
and
that
de
gama
left
two
of
his
convicts
at
this
place
which
he
called
san
clarke
there
is
no
circumstance
in
the
text
from
which
the
situation
of
this
river
can
even
be
conjectured
clarke
alleges
that
it
was
soffala
and
yet
in
a
note
in
his
preceding
page
says
that
de
gama
seems
to
have
passed
cape
corientes
during
the
night
and
to
have
kept
so
far
from
land
on
account
of
a
strong
current
setting
on
shore
as
not
to
have
noticed
sofala
in
the
notes
on
the
lusiad
this
river
of
good
signs
is
ascertained
to
have
been
one
of
the
mouths
of
the
zambeze
or
cuama
river
which
divides
mocaranga
from
the
coast
of
mozambique
the
different
mouths
of
which
run
into
the
sea
between
the
latitudes
of
and
they
were
evidently
afflicted
with
the
scurvy
and
accordingly
de
barros
refers
the
disease
to
its
proper
cause
having
been
for
so
long
a
time
confined
to
the
use
of
salt
fish
and
corrupted
clarke
addition
to
the
narrative
of
castaneda
from
de
clarke

obscure
expression
seems
to
mean
that
de
gama
wished
them
to
precede
the
ships
and
point
out
the
way
into
the
e
this
expression
has
probably
been
misunderstood
by
the
original
translator
it
appears
that
these
moors
of
mozambique
spoke
arabic
here
called
the
language
of
algarve
and
finding
themselves
understood
and
answered
by
the
strangers
mistook

the
observations

inserted

marked
with

made
by
the
editor
of
the
present
collection
they
are
much
too
long
for
insertion
in
the
form
of
a
note
and
appeared
of
too
much
importance
to
be
omitted
being
chiefly
from
clarke
i
e
for
the
materials
of
this
addition
to
the
text
of

we
are
chiefly
indebted
to
the
progress
of
maritime
discovery
his
name
as
given
by
osorius
was
and
de
barros
adds
that
he
wore
richly
embroidered
clothes
and
had
his
sword
ornamented
with
clarke
this
is
probably
the
same
person
named
fernan
alvares
on
a
former
e
it
is
added
by
de
barros
that
three
or
abyssinians
from
the
territory
of

on
board
the
fleet
along
with
the
moors
who
brought
provisions
and
seeing
the
image
of
the
angel
gabriel
painted
on
the
ship
of
that
name
and
being
accustomed
to
such
representations
of
angels
in
their
own
country
they
made
their
adorations
to
this
holy
clarke
mr
clarke
progr
of

strangely
misrepresents
this
story
saying
that
of
paulo
de

had
deserted
to
the
moors
though
a
e
according
to
de
burros
after
the
inhabitants
abandoned
the
town
the
zeque
sent
de
gama
a
pilot
to
navigate
coello
ship
from
whom
de
gama
learnt
that
calicut
was
a
months
voyage
from
clarke
i
if

above
were
the
first
of
april
the
friday
following

have
been

the
text
is
here
obscure
but
it
would
appear
that
only
some
of
the
men
belonging
to
these
two
boats
remained
on
board
and
the
rest
returned
to
the
coast
not
that
the
moorish

from

were

says
the

is
much
incommoded
with
shoals
and
so
narrow
in
some
places
as
not
to
exceed
the
length
of

this
city
is
said
to
have
once
stood
on
a
peninsula
converted
into
an
island
by
cutting
a
canal
across
the
clarke
i
this
may
be
understood
that
part
of
the
inhabitants
were
unmixed

comparatively
whites
while
others
were
of
a
mixed
race
between
these
and
the
original
natives
perhaps
likewise
partly
east
indian
mahometans
of
a
similar
e
this
is
surely
an
oversight
in
castaneda

his
translator
for
e
it
is
difficult
to
ascertain
what

castaneda
says
these
merchants
were
of
cambaya

above
eleven
degrees
north
of

this
seems
to
be
the
same
office
with
that
named
kadhi

khazi
by
the
turks
and
persians
which
is
rather
the
title
of
a
judge
than
of
a
priest

is
named

it
is
probable
that

passage
should
be
thus
understood

an
idolater

thus
miserably
erroneous

could
only
compute
by

course

about

about

almost
eleven

this
vague
account
of
the

erroneous

corrupt

said
to
have
thus
divided

kingdom
of
malabar
was
clarke
i
this
must
be
erroneous
as
the
mahometans
reckon
from
the
year
of
the
hegira
or
flight
of
mahomet
from
mecca
which
commences
in
of
the
christian
e
this
story
seems
an
arabian
tale
perhaps
partly
founded
upon
some
real
revolution
in
the
government
of

it
would
much
exceed

the
origin
of

obviously
from

was

of
a
navigable
communication
with

and
the
vast
riches
that
were
to
be
had
in
that
country
being
now
ascertained
the
king
resolved
to
prosecute
the
discovery
on
purpose
to
spread
the
gospel
among
the
idolaters
and
to
augment
his
own
revenues
and
the
riches
and
prosperity
of
his
subjects
for
these
purposes
he
determined
to
attempt
the
settlement
of
a
factory
in
calicut
by
gentle
means
hopeful
that
they
might
be
persuaded
to
a
friendly
intercourse
and
might
afterwards
listen
to
the
word
of
god
he
therefore
commanded
that
a
fleet
of
ten
ships
and
two
caravels
should
be
got
ready
against
next
year
to
be
well
laden
with
all
the
commodities
which
de
gama
had
reported
to
have
current
sale
in
calicut
there
went
others
also
to
sofala
and
quiloa
where
also
he
commanded
factories
to
be
established
both
on
account
of
the
gold
which
was
to
be
found
there
and
that
the
ships
might
have
a
place
to
touch
and
refresh
at
in
their
way
to
and
from
india
over
the
fleet
intended
for
calicut
he
appointed
pedro

that
if

would
not
quietly
consent
or
give
sufficient
lading
to
the
ships
he
should
make
cruel

upon
him
for

injurious
conduct
to

if
the

consented
to
the
establishment

the
general
was
secretly
to
request
him
not
to
allow
any
of
the
moors
of
mecca
to
remain
or
to
trade
in
calicut
or
any

hereafter
supply
all
such

used
to

of
better
quality

cheaper
than
theirs

been

from

by

together
with
a
present
for

sent

vicar
who
was
afterwards
bishop
and
who
was

the
catholic
faith

being
in
full
readiness
the

went
in

on
sunday
the
of

to
hear
mass
at
the
monastery
of

accompanied
by

to
do
him
the
more
honour

preached
a
sermon
in
which
he
gave
high
praise
to

for
undertaking
the
command
of
this
expedition
as
serving
not
only
the
king
his
temporal
master
but
the
eternal
god
his
spiritual
lord
drawing
many
comparisons
in
his
favour
from
the
grecian
and
roman
histories
mass
being
ended
a
banner
of
the
royal
arms
of
portugal
was
delivered
to
the
bishop
who
solemnly
blessed
it
and
returned
it
to
the
king
who
delivered
it
to
cabral
that
it
might
be
displayed
at
his
the
bishop
then
gave
a
bonnet
to
the
general
which
had
been
blessed
by
the
pope
and
placed
a
rich
jewel
with
his
own
hands
on
his
head
and
gave
him
his
blessing
when
these
ceremonies
were
ended
the
king
accompanied
the
to
the
water
side
where
he
and
the
other
captains
of
the
fleet
took
leave
of
the
king
kissing
his
hands
the
king
giving
them
gods
blessing
and
his
own
after
which
all
went
on
board
and
the
whole
fleet
saluted
the
king
by
discharging
all
the
ordnance
of
all
the
ships
but
the
wind
being
foul
the
fleet
could
not
depart
that
day
and
the
king
returned
to
lisbon
next
day
being
the
of
may
having
a
fair
wind
the
fleet
weighed
by
signal
from
the
general
and
set
sail
at
eight
in
the

then
begin

to
say
a

after
all
this
they
beganne
all
to
be
joyfull
every
man
to
use
his
severall
office
the

in

of

and
also
beleying

and
coyling

it
was
wonderful
to
see
such
a
number
of
diversities
of
offices
in
so
small
a
roome
as
is
the
bredth
and
length
of
a
going
on
their
voyage
with
a
quarter
wind
they
came
in
sight
of
the
canaries
on
the
of
march
and
passed
st
jago
on
the
on
the
of
the
same
month
the
caravel
commanded
by
vasco
de
tayde
parted
company
and
was
never
seen
afterwards
after
waiting
two
days
for
the
missing
ship
the
fleet
proceeded
on
its
voyage
and
on
the
of
april
came
in
sight
of
land
this
was
cause
of
much
joy
as
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
country
which
had
not
been
discovered
by
de
gama
because
it
lay
to
the
west
of
their
course
cabral
immediately
sent
off
the
master
of
his
ship
in
a
small
boat
to
examine
the
country
who
reported
that
it
appeared
pleasant
and
fertile
with
extensive
woods
and
many
inhabitants
the
fleet
was
brought
to
anchor
and
the
master
sent
again
on
shore
to
examine
more
narrowly
into
the
state
of
the
country
and
its
inhabitants
his
account
was
that
the
natives
were
well
proportioned
and
of
a
swarthy
colour
armed
with
bows
and
arrows
and
all
naked
a
storm
arising
at
night
the
fleet
weighed
anchor
and
stood
along
the
coast
till
they
found
a
good
harbour
in
which
they
all
came
to
anchor
naming
it
or
the
safe
port
as
it
was
quite
secure
in
all
weathers
our
men
took
two
of
the
natives
in
an
almadia
or
canoe
who
were
brought
to
the
admiral
but
no
one
could
understand
their
language
they
had
therefore
apparel
given
them
and
were
set
on
shore
much
pleased
this
encouraged
the
rest
of
the
natives
to
mix
with
our
people
in
a
friendly
manner
but
finding
nothing
to
detain
him
here
the
general
determined
to
take
in
a
supply
of
water
not
knowing
when
he
might
have
another
opportunity
next
day
being
in
easter
week
a
solemn
mass
was
said
on
shore
under
a
pavilion
and
a
sermon
was
preached
by
fra
henrique
during
service
many
of
the
natives
gathered
around
who
seemed
very
merry
playing
and
leaping
about
and
sounding
cornets
horns
and
other
instruments
after
mass
the
natives
followed
the
general
to
his
boat
singing
and
making
merry
in
the
afternoon
our
men
were
allowed
to
go
on
shore
where
they
bartered
cloth
and
paper
with
the
natives
for
parrots
and
other
beautiful
birds
which
are
very
numerous
in
that
country
and
with
whose
feathers
the
natives
make
very
shewy
hats
and
caps
some
of
our
men
went
into
the
country
to
see
the
towns
or
dwellings
of
the
natives
and
reported
that
the
land
was
very
fertile
and
full
of
woods
and
waters
with
plenty
of
fruits
of
various
kinds
and
much
cotton
as
this
was
the
country
now
so
well
known
by
the
name
of
brasil
i
shall
not
say
any
more
about
it
in
this
place
except
that
the
fleet
remained
here
for
eight
days
during
which
a
great
fish
was
thrown
ashore
by
the
sea
greater
than
any
and
as
broad
as
two
it
was
of
a
round
form
having
eyes
like
those
of
a
hog
and
ears
like
an
elephant
but
no
teeth
having
two
vents
under
its
belly
and
a
tail
three
quarters
of
a
yard
broad
and
as
much
in
length
the
skin
was
like
that
of
a
hog
and
a
finger
in
thickness
the
general
ordered
a
high
stone
cross
to
be
erected
at
this
place
and
named
his
new
discovery
tierra
de
santa
or
the
land
of
the
holy
cross
from
hence
he
sent
home
a
caravel
with
letters
to
the
king
giving
an
account
of
his
voyage
hitherto
and
that
he
had
left
two
exiles
in
this
place
to
examine
the
country
and
particularly
to
ascertain
if
it
were
a
continent
as
appeared
from
the
length
of
coast
he
had
passed
he
sent
likewise
one
of
the
natives
to
shew
what
kind
of
people
inhabited
the
land
considering
the
great
length
of
the
voyage
he
had
to
perform
cabral
did
not
deem
it
proper
to
spend
any
more
time
in
examining
this
new
country
but
departed
from
puerto
seguro
on
the
of
may
steering
his
course
for
the
cape
of
good
hope
which
was
estimated
to
be
leagues
distant
and
having
a
great
and
fearful
gulf
to
cross
rendered
dangerous
by
the
great
winds
which
prevail
in
these
seas
during
most
part
of
the
year
on
the
of
may
a
great
comet
appeared
in
the
heavens
coming
from
the
east
and
was
visible
during
ten
days
and
nights
always
increasing
in
splendour
on
saturday
the
of
may
there
arose
a
great
storm
from
the
attended
with
a
high
sea
and
heavy
rain
which
forced
the
whole
fleet
to
take
in
their
sails
on
its
abatement
they
again
spread
their
foresails
and
falling
calm
towards
night
the
ships
astern
spread
out
all
their
to
overtake
the
rest
on
sunday
the
the
wind
again
increased
and
all
the
sails
were
furled
between
ten
and
eleven
of
that
day
a
was
seen
in
the
and
the
wind
lulled
this
deceived
the
pilots
as
a
sign
of
good
weather
wherefore
they
still
carried
sail
but
it
was
succeeded
by
a
furious
tempest
which
came
on
so
suddenly
that
they
had
not
time
to
furl
their
sails
and
four
ships
were
sunk
with
all
their
men
one
of
which
was
commanded
by
bartholomew
diaz
the
discoverer
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
the
other
were
half
filled
with
water
and
had
been
all
lost
if
a
part
of
their
sails
had
not
given
way
to
the
tempest
soon
afterwards
the
storm
veered
to
the
but
still
continued
so
violent
that
they
had
to
drive
all
that
day
and
the
next
under
bare
poles
and
the
fleet
much
separated
on
the
third
day
the
wind
became
more
moderate
coming
round
to
the
east
and
attended
by
a
heavy
swell
and
the
waves
run
higher
than
had
ever
been
seen
before
yet
the
fleet
joined
again
to
their
great
joy
this
wind
and
high
sea
continued
for
twenty
days
during
all
which
time
the
ships
had
to
lie
to
and
were
so
tossed
that
no
one
thought
it
possible
to
escape
being
swallowed
up
during
day
the
sea
was
black
as
pitch
and
at
night
it
appeared
like
fire
the
general
with
simon
de
myranda
and
pedro
de
tayde
bore
up
to
windward
during
this
long
continued
gale
while
all
the
rest
submitted
to
the
wind
and
went
at
gods
mercy
when
the
storm
abated
the
general
found
that
with
only
two
other
ships
in
company
he
had
doubled
the
cape
of
good
hope
without
having
seen
it
on
the
of
july
they
fell
close
in
with
the
coast
of
africa
in
lat
but
the
pilots
did
not
know
the
coast
and
the
general
would
not
allow
any
one
to
go
on
shore
they
could
see
great
numbers
of
people
on
the
land
yet
none
came
down
to
the
shore
to
view
the
ships
having
no
hope
of
procuring
provisions
from
the
natives
the
seamen
caught
great
plenty
of
fish
at
this
place
after
which
the
general
pursued
his
course
close
along
shore
where
he
constantly
saw
many
people
and
great
numbers
of
cattle
feeding
along
the
banks
of
a
river
which
fell
into
the
sea
in
that
neighbourhood
proceeding
in
this
manner
the
general
came
to
sofala
with
which
the
pilots
were
unacquainted
near
which
lay
two
islands
close
by
one
of
which
two
vessels
lay
at
anchor
these
immediately
made
for
the
shore
on
seeing
the
portuguese
ships
and
being
pursued
were
taken
without
resistance
the
principal
person
belonging
to
these
vessels
was
a
near
relation
of
the
king
of
melinda
and
was
going
from
sofala
to
melinda
with
gold
the
people
were
so
much
afraid
on
seeing
our
ships
that
they
threw
a
great
part
of
the
gold
into
the
sea
and
most
of
them
escaped
on
shore
the
general
was
much
concerned
at
his
loss
especially
that
it
should
have
fallen
on
the
subject
and
relation
of
a
prince
who
was
in
friendship
with
the
king
his
master
and
after
shewing
him
every
civility
restored
the
two
vessels
with
all
the
remaining
gold
the
moor
asked
cabral
if
he
had
any
witches
on
board
who
could
conjure
up
his
gold
from
the
bottom
of
the
sea
cabral
answered
that
the
christians
believe
in
the
true
god
and
do
not
practice
or
give
credit
to
witchcraft
learning
from
this
moor
that
he
had
overshot
sofala
and
not
being
inclined
to
turn
back
the
general
continued
his
voyage
to
mozambique
where
he
arrived
on
the
of
july
and
took
in
a
supply
of
water
and
procured
a
pilot
to
carry
him
to
the
island
of
quiloa
towards
which
he
directed
his
course
in
this
part
of
the
voyage
he
saw
several
fertile
islands
belonging
to
the
king
of
quiloa
who
is
a
powerful
prince
his
dominions
extending
from
cape
corientes
almost
to
mombaza
along
nearly
leagues
of
coast
including
the
two
islands
near
sofala
that
city
itself
and
several
others
to
mozambique
many
more
all
the
way
to
mombaza
with
a
great
number
of
islands
from
all
which
he
derives
large
revenues
yet
he
has
few
soldiers
and
lives
in
no
great
state
his
constant
residence
is
in
an
island
named
quiloa
near
the
continent
of
ethiopia
an
hundred
leagues
from
mozambique
this
island
is
full
of
gardens
and
orchards
with
plenty
of
various
kinds
of
fruits
and
excellent
water
and
the
country
produces
abundance
of
and
other
grain
and
breeds
great
numbers
of
small
cattle
and
the
sea
affords
great
plenty
of
excellent
fish
the
city
of
quiloa
is
in
lat
and
long
handsomely
built
of
stone
and
lime
and
pleasantly
situated
between
fine
gardens
and
the
sea
having
abundance
of
provisions
from
its
own
island
and
from
other
places
on
the
continent
the
king
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
are
moors
of
a
fair
colour
using
the
arabic
language
but
the
original
natives
of
the
country
are
negroes
the
moors
of
quiloa
are
richly
dressed
especially
the
women
who
wear
many
golden
ornaments
they
are
great
merchants
enjoying
the
principal
trade
in
gold
at
sofala
whence
it
is
distributed
over
arabia
felix
and
other
countries
and
many
merchants
resort
thither
from
other
places
hence
there
are
always
many
ships
in
this
port
which
are
all
hauled
upon
the
beach
when
not
in
use
these
ships
have
no
nails
but
are
sewed
together
by
rope
made
of
and
have
their
bottoms
payed
with
wild
frankincense
as
the
country
produces
no
pitch
the
winter
here
begins
in
april
and
ends
in
may
on
arriving
at
quiloa
and
receiving
a
for
that
purpose
the
general
sent
alonso
hurtado
attended
by
seven
of
the
principal
officers
to
wait
upon
the
king
signifying
that
cabral
had
come
here
with
the
fleet
of
the
king
of
portugal
to
settle
a
trade
in
the
city
and
had
great
store
of
merchandize
fit
for
that
purpose
and
to
say
that
he
was
desirous
to
confer
with
his
highness
on
this
subject
but
had
been
forbidden
by
the
king
his
master
to
go
on
shore
the
king
agreed
to
give
cabral
an
audience
afloat
and
on
the
following
day
cabral
waited
for
the
king
in
his
boat
which
was
covered
over
with
flags
and
attended
by
all
the
other
captains
in
their
boats
as
now
sancho
de
toar
and
other
two
ships
had
joined
company
again
the
king
came
in
an
almadia
accompanied
by
many
principal
moors
in
other
boats
all
decked
with
flags
and
with
many
trumpets
cornets
and
sackbuts
making
a
great
noise
on
the
arrival
of
the
king
the
whole
portuguese
ordnance
was
fired
off
by
which
the
king
and
his
train
were
much
alarmed
not
having
been
accustomed
to
such
a
salute
after
mutual
civilities
the
letter
from
the
king
of
portugal
was
read
proposing
the
settlement
of
trade
between
the
two
nations
to
which
the
king
of
quiloa
assented
and
agreed
that
alonso
hurtado
should
wait
upon
him
next
day
with
an
account
of
the
kinds
of
merchandize
the
portuguese
had
to
dispose
of
for
which
he
promised
to
give
gold
in
exchange
but
when
hurtado
went
next
day
on
shore
the
king
made
many
excuses
for
not
performing
his
promise
pretending
to
have
no
need
of
the
commodities
and
believing
that
the
general
came
to
conquer
his
country
the
true
reason
was
because
he
was
a
moor
and
we
were
christians
and
he
was
unwilling
to
have
any
trade
or
intercourse
with
us
after
this
the
general
remained
three
or
four
days
to
see
if
the
king
would
change
his
mind
but
he
continued
inflexible
and
strengthened
himself
with
armed
men
as
jealous
of
being
attacked
finding
that
nothing
could
be
done
here
the
general
went
on
his
voyage
and
arrived
at
melinda
on
the
of
august
at
this
port
he
found
three
ships
at
anchor
belonging
to
moorish
merchants
of
cambaya
but
though
laden
with
great
riches
he
would
not
meddle
with
them
out
of
respect
for
the
king
of
melinda
on
coming
to
anchor
the
general
saluted
the
king
with
all
his
ordnance
on
which
the
king
sent
a
complimentary
message
of
welcome
with
a
present
of
many
sheep
hens
and
ducks
and
great
quantities
of
fruits
the
general
sent
a
message
in
return
intimating
that
he
had
come
here
by
orders
of
the
king
of
portugal
to
know
if
his
highness
had
any
service
which
the
fleet
could
perform
for
him
and
to
deliver
a
letter
and
a
rich
present
from
the
king
of
portugal
which
he
would
send
whenever
his
highness
pleased
to
give
his
commands
the
king
was
much
pleased
with
this
message
and
detained
the
messenger
all
night
most
part
of
which
he
spent
in
making
inquiries
respecting
the
kingdom
of
portugal
as
soon
as
it
was
day
the
king
sent
two
principal
moors
to
wait
upon
the
general
declaring
his
joy
at
his
arrival
and
desiring
if
he
had
need
of
any
thing
in
the
country
to
command
all
there
as
his
own
the
general
then
sent
aries
correa
the
of
the
fleet
on
shore
to
deliver
the
letter
and
presents
accompanied
by
most
of
the
principal
officers
and
having
all
the
trumpeters
of
the
fleet
sounding
before
him
the
present
consisted
of
the
rich
caparison
of
a
of
the
most
splendid
and
shewy
fashion
the
king
sent
the
nobles
of
his
court
to
receive
correa
in
great
state
and
several
women
who
had
censers
or
perfuming
pans
which
filled
the
air
with
a
delightful
odour
the
king
received
correa
in
his
palace
which
was
very
near
the
water
side
sitting
in
his
chair
of
state
and
accompanied
by
many
noblemen
and
gentlemen
the
letter
which
was
written
hi
portuguese
on
one
side
and
arabic
on
the
other
being
read
and
the
present
laid
before
the
king
he
and
his
nobles
all
in
one
voice
gave
thanks
to
god
and
mahomet
for
granting
them
the
friendship
of
so
great
a
prince
during
the
three
days
which
the
fleet
continued
here
correa
remained
on
shore
at
the
kings
particular
request
in
which
he
constantly
employed
himself
in
inquiries
concerning
the
customs
of
the
king
of
portugal
and
the
conduct
of
his
government
the
king
of
melinda
was
very
anxious
to
have
cabral
to
come
on
shore
to
the
palace
but
he
excused
himself
as
having
been
ordered
by
his
master
not
to
land
at
any
port
with
which
the
king
was
satisfied
yet
desired
to
have
an
interview
on
the
water
on
this
occasion
though
the
palace
was
very
near
the
sea
he
went
on
horseback
to
the
shore
having
his
horse
decorated
with
the
rich
caparisons
sent
him
by
the
king
of
portugal
which
were
obliged
to
be
put
on
by
one
of
our
men
as
none
of
the
natives
knew
their
use
on
coming
to
the
shore
certain
principal
natives
waited
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
having
a
live
sheep
which
they
opened
alive
taking
out
the
bowels
and
the
king
rode
over
the
carcase
of
the
sheep
is
a
kind
of
ceremony
that
the
witches
there
do
after
this
he
went
to
the
water
side
with
all
his
train
on
foot
saying
in
a
loud
voice
certain
words
of
incantation
the
interview
with
the
general
took
place
on
the
water
in
great
ceremony
and
the
king
gave
him
a
pilot
to
carry
the
fleet
to
calicut
cabral
left
two
banished
men
at
melinda
to
inform
themselves
of
all
the
circumstances
of
the
country
to
the
best
of
their
abilities
one
of
these
called
when
he
had
learned
the
arabic
language
went
afterwards
by
land
to
the
straits
of
the
red
sea
and
from
thence
by
cambaya
to
and
settled
with
the
or
lord
of
goa
passing
always
for
a
moor
this
man
was
afterwards
very
serviceable
to
albuquerque
as
will
be
seen
hereafter
leaving
melinda
on
the
of
august
he
came
to
ansandina
or
on
the
of
that
month
where
he
waited
some
days
for
the
fleet
of
mecca
which
he
meant
to
have
attacked
while
there
the
whole
of
the
crews
confessed
and
received
the
sacrament
no
ships
appearing
the
fleet
left
anchediva
and
sailed
for
calicut
coming
to
anchor
within
a
league
of
that
place
on
the
of
september
several
almadias
came
off
immediately
to
sell
victuals
and
some
of
the
principal
nayres
with
a
guzurat
merchant
brought
a
message
from
the
zamorin
declaring
his
satisfaction
at
the
arrival
of
the
general
at
his
city
in
which
every
thing
he
might
need
was
at
his
command
the
general
made
a
polite
answer
to
the
king
with
thanks
for
his
civility
and
gave
orders
to
bring
the
fleet
nearer
to
the
city
in
doing
which
all
the
ordnance
was
fired
as
a
salute
to
the
great
astonishment
of
the
natives
the
idolaters
among
them
saying
that
it
was
impossible
to
resist
us
next
day
one
gaspar
was
sent
on
shore
to
the
zamorin
desiring
to
have
a
for
a
deputation
from
the
general
to
wait
on
his
highness
and
along
with
gaspar
the
four
malabars
who
had
been
carried
away
from
calicut
by
don
vasco
de
la
gama
were
sent
on
shore
these
men
were
all
finely
dressed
in
portuguese
habits
and
the
whole
inhabitants
of
the
city
came
out
to
see
them
rejoiced
to
find
they
had
been
well
treated
though
the
zamorin
was
well
pleased
with
the
safe
return
of
his
subjects
he
refused
allowing
them
to
come
into
his
presence
as
they
were
only
fishermen
or
of
a
low
cast
but
he
sent
for
gaspar
whom
he
received
with
civility
and
whom
he
assured
that
our
people
might
come
on
shore
in
perfect
safety
on
receiving
this
intelligence
cabral
sent
alonso
hurtado
to
the
zamorin
intimating
that
the
portuguese
fleet
had
come
on
purpose
to
settle
trade
and
friendship
and
that
the
general
wished
for
an
audience
in
which
to
arrange
these
matters
with
his
highness
but
had
orders
from
the
king
his
master
not
to
go
on
shore
without
sufficient
pledges
for
his
security
among
whom
he
demanded
the
kutwal
of
calicut
and
araxamenoca
one
of
the
chiefs
of
the
nayres
on
this
occasion
hurtado
was
accompanied
by
a
person
who
could
speak
the
language
to
act
as
his
interpreter
the
zamorin
was
unwilling
to
send
the
hostages
required
alleging
that
they
were
old
and
sickly
and
offered
to
send
others
who
were
better
able
to
endure
the
hardships
of
living
on
board
yet
he
afterwards
at
the
instigation
of
the
moors
was
against
sending
any
hostages
as
they
made
him
believe
that
the
general
shewed
little
confidence
in
his
promise
which
was
derogatory
to
his
honour
and
dignity
this
negociation
lasted
three
days
as
hurtado
insisted
on
this
as
a
necessary
preliminary
at
length
desirous
of
having
trade
settled
with
us
owing
to
the
advantages
which
would
accrue
to
his
revenue
the
zamorin
agreed
to
give
the
hostages
required
on
which
leaving
the
command
of
the
fleet
in
his
absence
to
sancho
de
toar
cabral
directed
that
the
hostages
should
be
well
treated
but
on
no
account
to
deliver
them
to
any
one
even
although
demanded
in
his
name
on
the
of
december
cabral
went
on
shore
magnificently
dressed
and
attended
by
thirty
of
his
principal
officers
and
others
the
kings
servants
in
as
much
state
as
if
he
had
been
king
of
portugal
carrying
with
him
rich
furniture
for
his
apartments
with
a
cupboard
of
plate
containing
many
rich
pieces
of
gilt
silver
he
was
met
by
many
principal
nayres
sent
by
the
zamorin
to
wait
upon
him
and
attended
by
a
numerous
train
among
whom
were
many
persons
sounding
trumpets
sackbuts
and
other
musical
instruments
the
zamorin
waited
for
him
in
a
gallery
close
by
the
shore
which
had
been
erected
on
purpose
and
while
the
general
went
towards
the
shore
accompanied
by
all
the
boats
of
the
fleet
dressed
out
with
flags
and
streamers
the
hostages
were
carried
on
board
his
ship
where
they
were
loath
to
enter
till
they
should
see
the
general
on
shore
lest
he
might
return
and
detain
them
but
were
at
last
reassured
of
their
safety
by
aries
correa
on
landing
cabral
was
received
in
great
state
by
several
and
other
principal
nayres
by
whose
directions
he
was
placed
in
an
or
chair
in
which
he
was
carried
to
the
or
hall
of
audience
where
the
king
waited
his
arrival
the
serame
or
gallery
was
all
hung
round
with
rich
carpets
called
and
at
the
farther
end
the
zamorin
sat
in
an
alcove
or
recess
resembling
a
small
chapel
with
a
canopy
of
unshorn
crimson
velvet
over
his
head
and
having
twenty
silk
cushions
under
him
and
about
him

of

his

wrought
with
gold
on
his

wore
a
cap
of

of
gold
resembling
a
helmet
in
his
ears
he
had
rich
jewels
of
diamonds
sapphires
and
pearls
two
of
the
latter
being
as
large
as
walnuts
his
arms
from
the
elbows
to
the
wrists
were
covered
with
golden
bracelets
set
with
numberless
precious
stones
of
great
value
and
his
legs
from
the
knees
to
the
ankles
were
similarly
adorned
his
fingers
and
toes
had
numerous
rings
and
on
one
of
his
great
toes
he
wore
a
ruby
of
great
size
and
wonderful
brilliancy
one
of
his
diamonds
was
bigger
than
a
large
bean
all
these
were
greatly
surpassed
by
his
girdle
of
gold
and
jewels
which
was
altogether
inestimable
and
was
so
brilliant
that
it
dazzled
the
eyes
of
the
beholders
beside
the
zamorin
was
a
rich
throne
or
state
chair
all
of
gold
and
jewels
and
his
in
which
he
had
been
carried
from
the

of
similar
richness
and
stood
near
him

was
attended
by

seventeen
of
whom
had
silver
trumpets
and
three
of
them

the

finely

was
lighted
by

in
the
fashion
of
the
moors
close
by
the
king
there
stood
a
spitting
basin
of

and
several

produced
an
excellent
odour
six
paces
from
the
king
he
was
attended
on
by
his
two
brothers
who
were
the
nearest
heirs
to
the
kingdom
and
a
little
farther
off
were
many
noblemen
all
standing
on
entering
the
hall
and
seeing
the
splendid
state
of
the
zamorin
cabral
would
have
kissed
his
hand
as
is
the
custom
of
europe
but
was
informed
that
this
was
not
customary
among
them
and
therefore
sat
down
in
a
chair
near
the
king
which
was
appointed
for
him
as
an
especial
honour
he
then
delivered
his
letter
of
credit
from
the
king
of
portugal
written
in
arabic
and
then
said
that
the
king
his
master
willing
to
cultivate
trade
and
friendship
with
the
zamorin
and
his
subjects
had
given
him
orders
to
require
permission
to
establish
a
factory
or
house
of
trade
in
calicut
which
should
always
be
supplied
with
every
kind
of
merchandize
that
was
in
demand
and
requested
the
zamorin
to
supply
a
sufficient
loading
of
spices
for
the
ships
under
his
command
which
he
was
ready
to
pay
for
either
by
means
of
the
commodities
he
had
on
board
or
in
ready
money
the
zamorin
seemed
or
affected
to
be
pleased
with
the
embassy
and
said
that
the
king
of
portugal
was
welcome
to
every
thing
in
his
city
of
which
he
was
in
need
at
this
time
the
present
from
the
king
of
portugal
to
the
zamorin
was
brought
forwards
which
among
other
things
contained
a
richly
wrought
basin
and
ewer
of
silver
gilt
a
gilt
silver
flaggon
and
cover
of
similar
workmanship
two
silver
maces
four
cushions
two
of
which
were
cloth
of
gold
and
the
other
two
of
unshorn
crimson
velvet
a
state
canopy
of
cloth
of
gold
bound
and
fringed
with
gold
a
carpet
of
rich
crimson
velvet
two
very
rich
arras
hangings
one
ornamented
with
human
figures
and
the
other
with
representations
of
trees
and
flowers
the
zamorin
was
much
satisfied
with
this
present
and
said
the
general
might
either
retire
to
his
lodgings
for
rest
and
refreshment
or
might
return
to
his
ships
as
he
thought
best
but
as
the
hostages
were
men
of
high
cast
and
could
not
endure
the
sea
who
could
neither
eat
or
drink
while
on
board
consistent
with
their
customs
it
became
necessary
that
they
should
come
on
shore
wherefore
if
the
general
would
return
to
his
ship
and
send
these
men
on
shore
and
inclined
to
come
back
next
day
to
conclude
all
matters
relative
to
the
trade
of
calicut
the
same
hostages
should
be
again
sent
on
board
as
the
general
placed
confidence
in
these
assurances
of
the
zamorin
he
went
on
board
leaving
hurtado
and
other
seven
of
his
people
in
charge
of
his
valuables
that
were
left
on
shore
when
at
the
water
side
and
ready
to
embark
a
servant
of
one
of
the
hostages
who
was
dispatched
by
the
comptroller
of
the
zamorins
household
went
before
in
an
almadia
or
small
pinnace
and
gave
notice
to
the
hostages
that
the
general
was
coming
on
board
on
which
they
leapt
into
the
sea
meaning
to
escape
to
land
in
the
almadia
with
the
servant
but
aries
correa
went
immediately
with
some
of
the
portuguese
mariners
in
a
boat
and
retook
two
of
the
hostages
with
three
or
four
of
the
malabars
belonging
to
the
almadia
the
rest
of
the
hostages
among
whom
was
the
kutwal
got
to
the
city
when
cabral
came
on
board
and
learnt
what
had
happened
he
ordered
the
two
remaining
hostages
to
be
secured
below
deck
and
sent
a
complaint
to
the
zamorin
against
the
conduct
of
the
hostages
laying
all
the
blame
on
the
comptroller
he
desired
the
messenger
to
inform
the
zamorin
of
the
situation
of
the
two
remaining
hostages
and
to
say
that
they
should
be
liberated
whenever
the
portuguese
and
the
goods
on
shore
were
sent
back
to
the
ships
next
day
the
zamorin
came
to
the
shore
accompanied
by
men
and
sent
off
the
portuguese
people
and
their
commodities
to
the
ships
in
thirty
almadias
with
orders
to
bring
back
the
hostages
but
none
of
the
malabars
in
the
almadias
dared
to
approach
the
ships
being
afraid
of
the
portuguese
and
returned
therefore
to
the
land
without
delivering
our
people
and
commodities
next
day
the
general
sent
some
of
his
own
boats
to
land
the
pledges
but
at
some
distance
from
the
almadias
on
which
occasion
araxamenoca
one
of
the
hostages
leapt
into
the
sea
with
an
intention
to
escape
but
was
retaken
and
while
our
people
were
busied
in
securing
him
the
other
hostage
made
his
escape
the
general
was
astonished
at
the
want
of
truth
and
honour
in
these
people
and
gave
orders
to
keep
araxamenoca
in
strict
custody
but
finding
at
the
end
of
three
days
that
the
zamorin
did
not
send
for
him
and
that
during
all
this
period
he
refused
all
sustenance
cabral
took
compassion
on
him
and
sent
him
to
the
zamorin
requesting
that
two
of
our
men
who
remained
on
shore
might
be
sent
on
board
which
was
complied
with
after
waiting
three
days
without
any
message
from
the
zamorin
the
general
sent
one
francisco
correa
to
inquire
if
he
inclined
to
confirm
the
agreement
between
them
in
which
case
he
would
send
aries
correa
on
shore
to
treat
with
his
highness
for
whose
safety
he
required
hostages
the
zamorin
answered
that
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
have
the
trade
established
and
that
the
general
might
send
aries
correa
or
any
other
person
on
shore
for
that
purpose
and
transmitted
two
grandsons
of
a
rich
merchant
of
guzerate
as
hostages
aries
correa
went
accordingly
on
shore
and
was
accommodated
by
the
orders
of
the
zamorin
with
a
convenient
house
for
himself
and
his
goods
which
belonged
to
the
guzerate
merchant
who
was
likewise
commanded
to
assist
correa
in
regard
to
the
prices
of
his
merchandize
and
all
other
things
relating
to
the
trade
and
customs
of
the
place
but
this
man
being
a
friend
to
the
moors
of
mecca
thwarted
him
in
all
things
instead
of
giving
him
assistance
the
moors
were
determined
enemies
to
our
people
both
for
being
christians
and
lest
their
credit
and
advantageous
traffic
in
calicut
might
suffer
by
the
establishment
of
our
trade
in
that
port
wherefore
by
means
of
their
confederacy
with
the
guzerate
merchant
they
took
our
goods
at
any
price
they
pleased
and
intimidated
the
malabars
from
trading
with
us
the
moors
concluded
that
the
establishment
of
our
factory
would
lower
the
price
of
such
commodities
as
they
had
to
sell
and
would
inhance
the
value
of
the
spiceries
drugs
and
jewels
which
they
took
in
exchange
on
this
account
they
thwarted
correa
in
all
his
transactions
offering
higher
prices
than
ordinary
for
every
article
by
which
he
was
constrained
to
buy
every
thing
at
a
very
dear
rate
if
at
any
time
he
wished
an
audience
of
the
zamorin
the
moors
always
contrived
to
be
present
that
some
of
them
might
speak
against
him
in
this
conduct
they
were
assisted
by
a
moor
who
was
admiral
of
calicut
who
likewise
hindered
any
of
our
people
of
the
factory
from
going
on
board
the
fleet
and
detained
any
of
our
boats
that
approached
the
shore
pretending
to
do
this
by
command
of
the
zamorin
on
learning
this
sinister
conduct
of
the
moorish
admiral
of
calicut
and
suspecting
some
intended
treachery
the
general
gave
orders
to
the
fleet
to
weigh
their
anchors
and
to
remove
out
of
the
harbour
lest
they
might
be
attacked
by
the
zamorins
fleet
and
that
he
might
take
counsel
with
the
other
captains
for
the
safety
of
the
expedition
on
learning
this
the
zamorin
inquired
the
reason
from
correa
who
urged
the
injurious
behaviour
of
the
moors
and
told
him
all
that
they
had
done
the
zamorin
immediately
gave
orders
that
the
moors
should
discontinue
their
villanous
conduct
towards
us
and
even
removed
the
guzerate
merchant
from
our
factory
appointing
one
in
his
place
who
though
a
moor
was
a
very
honest
man
and
behaved
to
us
in
a
friendly
manner
this
man
was
of
great
credit
in
calicut
being
the
head
of
all
the
native
moors
of
that
country
who
are
always
at
variance
with
the
moors
of
cairo
and
of
the
red
sea
of
whom
the
admiral
samicide
was
the
chief
the
zamorin
gave
farther
orders
that
our
factory
should
be
removed
to
a
house
close
to
the
shore
which
belonged
to
cosebequin
that
our
merchants
might
have
greater
freedom
to
buy
and
sell
without
any
interruption
from
the
moors
for
the
greater
security
a
deed
of
gift
was
made
of
this
house
by
the
zamorin
to
the
king
of
portugal
and
his
successors
for
ever
a
copy
of
which
signed
and
sealed
by
the
zamorin
was
enclosed
in
a
casket
of
gold
that
it
might
be
conveyed
to
portugal
and
permission
was
given
to
display
a
flag
of
the
royal
arms
of
portugal
from
the
top
of
the
factory
on
receiving
intelligence
of
these
favourable
measures
cabral
brought
back
the
fleet
into
the
harbour
of
calicut
and
sent
his
compliments
of
thanks
to
the
zamorin
for
his
gracious
and
favourable
dispositions
after
this
our
factory
had
tolerably
good
fortune
in
conducting
its
trade
by
the
assistance
of
cosebequin
and
the
natives
finding
our
factory
favoured
by
the
zamorin
behaved
so
very
civilly
to
our
people
that
they
could
go
about
wherever
they
pleased
with
as
much
freedom
and
safety
as
in
lisbon
during
the
subsistence
of
this
friendly
intercourse
a
large
moorish
ship
was
descried
from
calicut
on
its
voyage
from
cochin
for
cambaya
and
the
zamorin
requested
our
general
to
make
prize
of
the
ship
alleging
that
it
contained
a
peculiarly
fine
elephant
which
he
wished
to
possess
and
which
had
been
refused
to
him
although
he
had
offered
more
than
its
value
the
general
answered
that
he
would
do
this
willingly
to
gratify
his
highness
but
as
he
was
informed
the
ship
was
large
and
well
manned
both
with
mariners
and
soldiers
it
could
not
be
expected
to
surrender
without
resistance
in
which
some
men
might
be
slain
on
both
sides
and
it
was
therefore
necessary
he
should
have
the
sanction
of
his
highness
to
kill
these
people
in
case
of
resistance
which
was
accordingly
granted
upon
which
the
general
sent
pedro
de
tayde
in
his
caravel
accompanied
by
a
valiant
young
gentleman
named
duarte
or
edward
pacheco
and
by
sixty
fighting
men
with
orders
to
take
this
ship
along
with
them
the
zamorin
sent
certain
moors
that
they
might
witness
the
manner
of
fighting
used
by
the
portuguese
the
caravel
gave
chase
to
the
moorish
ship
till
night
and
then
lost
sight
of
her
but
in
sailing
along
shore
by
they
saw
her
riding
at
anchor
ready
for
defence
judging
her
to
be
about
tons
burthen
and
to
contain
fighting
men
pacheco
according
to
his
orders
did
not
think
proper
to
lay
the
moorish
ship
on
board
but
commanded
his
ship
to
be
brought
to
intending
to
sink
the
moorish
ship
by
means
of
his
ordnance
in
case
of
necessity
the
moors
made
light
of
our
small
force
which
they
greeted
with
loud
cries
and
the
sound
of
musical
instruments
after
which
they
played
their
ordnance
against
our
caravel
they
were
bravely
answered
by
our
men
and
one
of
our
balls
struck
them
between
wind
and
water
so
that
the
moorish
ship
took
in
much
water
and
many
of
their
men
being
killed
and
wounded
by
our
shot
they
bore
away
for
the
bay
of
cananor
which
was
very
near
and
came
there
to
anchor
beside
other
four
moorish
ships
pacheco
followed
them
and
continued
to
batter
them
with
his
guns
and
had
assuredly
taken
them
had
not
certain
belonging
to
the
moors
come
from
the
port
of
cananor
to
their
assistance
the
night
growing
very
dark
pacheco
quitted
the
bay
lest
his
caravel
might
be
set
on
fire
by
the
moors
and
came
to
anchor
close
to
an
island
at
a
short
distance
having
had
nine
of
his
men
wounded
by
arrows
during
the
engagement
next
morning
pacheco
again
attacked
the
moorish
ship
which
at
last
yielded
to
the
great
displeasure
of
the
natives
of
cananor
who
had
flocked
to
the
seaside
intending
to
have
succoured
the
moors
but
on
pacheco
sending
a
few
shots
among
them
they
all
dispersed
pacheco
came
next
day
to
calicut
with
his
prize
where
the
zamorin
came
down
to
the
water
side
to
see
the
moorish
ship
giving
great
praise
to
our
people
for
their
prowess
being
much
astonished
that
so
great
a
ship
should
be
taken
by
one
so
much
inferior
in
size
and
number
of
men
the
general
commanded
this
ship
to
be
delivered
to
the
zamorin
together
with
the
seven
elephants
that
were
on
board
which
were
worth
in
calicut
crowns
he
also
sent
a
message
to
the
zamorin
saying
that
he
need
not
be
astonished
at
this
action
as
he
would
perform
much
greater
actions
to
serve
his
highness
the
zamorin
returned
thanks
for
what
had
been
done
and
desired
the
brave
men
who
had
performed
this
gallant
action
to
be
sent
him
that
he
might
do
them
honour
and
reward
them
as
they
deserved
and
he
bestowed
large
presents
upon
pacheco
in
particular
some
affirm
that
the
performance
of
this
gallant
feat
by
so
small
a
number
of
our
men
against
such
great
odds
raised
fear
and
jealousy
of
the
portuguese
in
the
mind
of
the
zamorin
and
made
him
anxious
to
get
them
away
from
his
country
for
which
cause
he
gave
his
consent
to
the
treachery
which
was
used
against
them
as
i
mean
to
shew
in
the
sequel
the
moors
of
calicut
were
more
terrified
than
ever
at
the
portuguese
in
consequence
of
the
capture
of
this
ship
and
were
much
offended
by
the
favour
bestowed
by
the
zamorin
upon
our
men
for
their
gallantry
on
this
occasion
they
believed
that
all
this
was
done
out
of
revenge
against
themselves
for
the
injuries
they
had
done
us
and
was
intended
to
induce
them
to
retire
from
calicut
especially
as
our
people
brought
there
as
great
store
of
merchandize
as
they
did
and
bought
as
many
spices
taking
all
this
into
consideration
they
procured
an
audience
of
the
zamorin
to
whom
one
of
their
number
made
the
following
oration
in
the
name
of
all
the
moors
emparather
of
all
the
malabars
as
great
as
the
mightiest
sovereign
of
the
indies
and
most
powerful
among
the
princes
of
the
earth
we
are
astonished
that
you
should
debase
yourself
by
receiving
into
your
country
these
enemies
of
your
law
and
strangers
to
the
customs
of
your
kingdom
who
seem
pirates
rather
than
merchants
we
should
not
wonder
at
your
so
doing
were
your
city
in
want
of
the
commodities
they
bring
or
could
not
otherwise
dispose
of
the
spiceries
they
purchase
but
we
whom
you
have
long
known
and
whose
fidelity
you
are
well
assured
of
by
experience
have
always
done
both
to
the
great
increase
of
your
revenue
you
appear
to
forget
all
this
by
receiving
those
whom
you
do
not
know
into
your
favour
and
employing
them
to
revenge
your
injuries
as
if
your
own
numerous
and
faithful
subjects
were
incompetent
for
the
purpose
in
this
you
dishonour
yourself
and
embolden
these
strangers
to
hold
your
power
in
contempt
and
to
act
as
we
know
they
will
hereafter
by
robbing
and
plundering
all
merchant
ships
that
frequent
your
port
to
the
ruin
of
your
country
and
who
will
at
length
take
possession
of
your
city
this
is
the
true
intent
of
their
coming
into
these
seas
and
not
to
trade
for
spices
as
they
pretend
their
country
is
almost
leagues
from
hence
and
the
voyage
out
and
home
is
attended
by
many
dangers
through
unknown
and
stormy
seas
besides
the
great
cost
of
their
large
ships
with
so
many
men
and
guns
hence
at
whatever
prices
they
may
dispose
of
their
spices
in
portugal
it
is
obvious
such
a
trade
must
be
carried
on
with
great
loss
which
is
a
manifest
proof
that
they
are
pirates
and
not
merchants
who
come
here
to
rob
and
to
take
your
city
the
house
you
have
given
them
for
a
factory
they
will
convert
into
a
fort
from
whence
they
will
make
war
on
you
when
you
least
expect
it
all
this
we
say
more
from
the
good
will
we
owe
you
than
for
any
profit
for
if
you
do
not
listen
to
our
advice
there
are
other
cities
in
malabar
to
which
we
will
remove
and
to
which
the
spices
will
be
conveyed
for
us
to
this
harangue
the
zamorin
gave
a
favourable
answer
saying
that
he
would
give
attention
to
all
they
had
said
of
which
indeed
he
already
had
some
suspicions
that
he
had
employed
the
portuguese
to
seize
the
ship
to
try
their
courage
and
had
allowed
them
to
load
their
ships
that
the
money
they
had
brought
to
purchase
goods
might
remain
in
the
country
and
finally
that
he
would
not
forsake
them
in
favour
of
the
strangers
the
moors
were
by
no
means
satisfied
with
all
this
because
the
zamorin
did
not
order
us
to
depart
from
calicut
and
did
not
stop
our
trade
which
was
their
chief
purpose
though
disappointed
in
these
views
they
continued
to
intermiddle
in
our
affairs
particularly
by
buying
up
the
spices
and
sending
them
elsewhere
in
hope
of
irritating
our
people
and
bringing
on
a
quarrel
that
they
might
have
a
pretext
to
attack
us
this
they
were
much
inclined
to
bring
about
as
being
greatly
more
numerous
than
our
men
they
hoped
the
zamorin
would
take
part
with
them
against
us
they
likewise
used
all
possible
means
to
draw
over
the
common
people
of
calicut
to
their
side
and
to
excite
them
to
enmity
against
us
by
making
them
believe
that
our
people
had
injured
them
through
those
devices
our
factor
was
unable
to
procure
more
spices
than
sufficed
to
load
two
ships
in
the
course
of
three
months
from
which
the
general
was
convinced
that
the
friendly
assurances
of
the
zamorin
was
little
to
be
depended
on
and
if
he
had
not
been
afraid
of
not
being
able
to
procure
a
sufficient
supply
elsewhere
he
would
have
gone
to
another
port
but
having
already
consumed
a
long
time
and
been
at
heavy
charges
he
determined
to
remain
at
calicut
and
sent
a
message
to
the
zamorin
complaining
of
the
delays
which
ill
accorded
with
the
promises
of
his
highness
that
the
whole
fleet
should
be
loaded
in
twenty
days
whereas
three
months
were
now
elapsed
and
the
loading
of
two
ships
only
was
procured
he
urged
the
zamorins
promise
that
the
portuguese
ships
were
to
be
first
loaded
whereas
he
had
assured
information
that
the
moors
had
bought
up
great
quantities
of
spices
at
lower
prices
and
sent
them
to
other
places
and
begged
the
zamorin
to
consider
that
it
was
now
time
for
the
ships
to
begin
their
voyage
to
portugal
and
that
he
anxiously
wished
for
dispatch
on
receiving
this
message
the
zamorin
pretended
to
be
much
surprised
that
our
ships
were
still
unprovided
with
a
loading
and
could
not
believe
that
the
moors
had
secretly
bought
up
and
removed
the
spices
contrary
to
his
orders
and
even
gave
permission
to
the
general
to
take
those
ships
belonging
to
the
moors
which
were
laden
with
spices
paying
the
same
prices
for
the
spices
which
had
been
given
by
the
moors
this
intelligence
gave
much
satisfaction
to
the
moors
as
a
favourable
opportunity
for
drawing
on
hostilities
with
the
portuguese
and
accordingly
one
of
the
principal
moorish
merchants
began
immediately
to
load
his
ship
openly
with
all
kinds
of
drugs
and
spices
and
suborned
several
moors
and
indians
who
pretended
to
be
the
friends
of
our
factor
to
insinuate
that
he
would
never
be
able
to
find
a
sufficient
loading
for
our
fleet
if
he
did
not
seize
that
ship
correa
listened
to
this
insidious
advice
which
he
communicated
to
the
general
urging
him
to
take
that
moorish
ship
as
he
had
license
from
the
zamorin
to
that
effect
the
general
was
exceedingly
unwilling
to
proceed
to
this
extremity
afraid
of
the
influence
of
the
moors
with
the
zamorin
and
of
producing
hostilities
with
the
natives
but
correa
remonstrated
against
delay
protesting
that
the
general
should
be
responsible
for
all
losses
that
might
accrue
to
the
king
of
portugal
through
his
neglect
by
this
urgency
of
the
factor
the
general
sent
all
the
boats
of
the
squadron
on
the
of
december
to
take
possession
of
the
moorish
ship
when
this
intelligence
was
received
on
shore
the
moors
thought
this
a
favourable
opportunity
of
destroying
our
people
and
immediately
raised
a
great
outcry
against
the
portuguese
incensing
the
people
of
the
city
to
join
with
them
in
complaining
to
the
zamorin
to
whom
they
went
in
a
tumultuous
manner
representing
that
we
had
bought
and
shipped
a
much
larger
quantity
of
drugs
and
spices
than
the
value
of
all
our
merchandize
and
not
contented
with
this
were
for
taking
all
like
thieves
and
pirates
they
blamed
the
zamorin
for
permitting
us
to
trade
in
the
city
and
requested
his
license
to
revenge
themselves
upon
us
for
the
loss
of
their
vessel
the
faithless
and
inconstant
king
save
them
the
license
they
required
on
which
they
immediately
armed
themselves
and
ran
furiously
to
our
factory
which
was
surrounded
by
a
wall
eight
or
ten
feet
high
and
contained
at
that
time
seventy
portuguese
among
whom
was
fra
henriques
and
his
friars
of
our
people
in
the
factory
only
eight
were
armed
with
crossbows
all
the
rest
being
only
armed
with
swords
with
nothing
to
defend
them
but
their
cloaks
on
hearing
the
tumult
our
people
went
to
the
gate
of
the
factory
and
seeing
only
a
few
assailants
they
thought
to
defend
themselves
with
their
swords
against
a
mischievous
rabble
but
the
numbers
of
the
moors
soon
increased
and
galled
our
people
so
severely
with
their
spears
and
arrows
that
they
were
forced
to
shut
the
gates
after
killing
seven
of
the
enemy
hoping
to
be
able
to
defend
themselves
by
means
of
the
wall
in
this
conflict
four
of
our
men
were
slain
and
several
wounded
and
all
the
remainder
mounted
the
wall
to
defend
it
by
means
of
the
crossbows
judging
that
the
assailants
were
at
least
four
thousand
men
among
whom
were
several
nayres
cores
now
found
himself
unable
to
defend
the
factory
against
so
great
a
force
and
therefore
hoisted
a
flag
as
signal
to
the
fleet
the
general
was
at
this
time
sick
in
bed
having
been
just
blooded
and
was
not
therefore
able
to
go
in
person
to
relieve
the
people
in
the
factory
but
immediately
sent
all
the
boats
of
the
fleet
well
manned
under
the
command
of
sancho
de
toar
but
he
was
afraid
to
venture
on
land
with
so
small
a
force
against
so
great
a
multitude
or
even
to
approach
too
near
the
shore
lest
the
enemies
might
assail
him
in
their
almadias
and
tonis
he
lay
off
therefore
at
a
considerable
distance
where
he
remained
a
spectator
of
the
valiant
defence
made
by
our
people
at
the
factory
whence
they
killed
great
numbers
of
the
assailants
but
their
enemies
always
increased
in
numbers
and
they
at
length
brought
up
certain
engines
to
beat
down
part
of
the
wall
in
which
they
at
length
succeeded
on
this
our
men
issued
out
by
a
door
which
led
towards
the
sea
side
in
hopes
of
being
able
to
fight
their
way
to
the
boats
in
which
attempt
corea
was
slain
and
fifty
more
of
our
men
were
either
killed
or
made
prisoners
twenty
only
escaping
who
swam
to
the
boats
most
of
whom
were
much
wounded
among
these
were
fra
henriques
and
antonio
the
son
of
aries
corea
then
only
eleven
years
old
who
hath
since
done
many
noble
feats
of
arms
in
the
indies
and
other
places
as
i
shall
afterwards
declare
in
the
book
of
this
history
the
general
was
much
concerned
at
this
event
not
only
for
the
loss
of
his
men
but
on
seeing
how
little
confidence
could
be
reposed
on
the
promises
of
the
zamorin
after
all
the
presents
he
had
received
and
the
services
which
had
been
performed
for
him
he
had
now
spent
three
months
at
calicut
during
which
he
had
only
loaded
two
of
his
ships
and
knew
not
how
to
procure
loading
for
the
rest
especially
as
he
could
not
expect
a
favourable
reception
at
cochin
on
account
of
having
captured
the
ship
with
the
elephant
as
before
related
considering
the
treason
which
had
been
practised
on
our
men
the
general
determined
upon
taking
a
signal
revenge
if
the
zamorin
did
not
make
an
ample
excuse
for
what
had
taken
place
and
make
a
full
reparation
by
immediately
providing
the
rest
of
the
ships
with
lading
the
zamorin
however
had
no
such
intentions
being
much
pleased
with
what
the
moors
had
done
and
even
ordered
all
the
goods
in
our
factory
to
be
seized
to
the
value
of
ducats
he
likewise
ordered
all
of
our
people
who
had
been
taken
on
shore
to
be
made
captives
four
of
whom
died
of
their
wounds
seeing
that
no
message
or
excuse
was
sent
by
the
zamorin
all
that
day
the
general
held
a
council
with
his
officers
as
to
the
proper
steps
to
be
taken
on
the
present
emergency
when
it
was
determined
to
take
immediate
and
ample
revenge
without
giving
time
to
the
zamorin
to
arm
his
fleet
on
this
orders
were
issued
to
take
possession
of
ten
large
ships
which
lay
in
the
road
or
harbour
of
calicut
which
was
done
after
some
resistance
many
of
their
crews
being
killed
or
drowned
and
others
made
prisoners
who
were
reserved
to
serve
as
mariners
on
board
our
fleet
some
spices
and
other
merchandize
were
taken
in
these
ships
and
three
elephants
which
were
killed
and
salted
as
provisions
for
the
voyage
and
it
appeared
that
moors
were
slain
in
defending
these
ships
after
every
thing
of
value
was
taken
from
the
moorish
ships
they
were
all
burnt
in
sight
of
the
city
many
of
the
moors
embarked
in
their
almadias
to
attempt
succouring
their
ships
but
our
men
soon
put
them
to
flight
by
means
of
their
ordnance
the
zamorin
and
the
whole
city
of
calicut
were
much
mortified
to
see
so
many
ships
destroyed
and
them
unable
to
help
but
their
astonishment
and
terror
were
much
increased
by
the
events
of
the
ensuing
day
during
the
night
the
general
ordered
all
the
ships
of
the
fleet
to
be
towed
as
near
as
possible
to
the
shore
by
means
of
the
boats
and
spread
out
at
some
distance
from
each
other
that
they
might
be
able
to
reach
the
city
with
their
ordnance
which
as
soon
as
day
broke
was
directed
to
play
upon
the
city
in
every
direction
doing
vast
damage
among
the
houses
the
natives
brought
down
to
the
shore
such
small
pieces
of
ordnance
as
they
possessed
which
they
fired
off
against
us
but
without
being
able
to
do
us
any
injury
whereas
not
a
shot
of
ours
missed
taking
effect
either
among
the
multitude
of
our
enemies
which
flocked
to
the
shore
or
on
the
buildings
of
the
city
both
the
houses
of
the
inhabitants
and
the
temples
of
their
deities
receiving
incredible
damage
so
great
was
the
consternation
that
the
zamorin
fled
from
his
palace
and
one
of
his
chief
nayres
was
killed
by
a
ball
close
beside
him
part
even
of
the
palace
was
destroyed
by
the
cannonade
towards
afternoon
two
ships
were
seen
approaching
the
harbour
which
immediately
changed
their
course
on
seeing
how
our
fleet
was
employed
on
which
the
general
ceased
firing
against
calicut
and
made
all
sail
after
these
two
ships
to
pandarane
where
they
took
shelter
among
other
seven
ships
lying
at
anchor
close
to
the
shore
and
filled
with
moors
finding
that
our
fleet
could
not
get
near
enough
to
attack
them
owing
to
shallow
water
and
considering
that
it
was
now
late
in
the
season
for
his
voyage
back
to
lisbon
the
general
resolved
to
be
contented
with
the
revenge
he
had
already
taken
upon
calicut
and
made
sail
for
cochin
where
he
was
informed
there
was
more
pepper
to
be
had
than
even
at
calicut
and
where
he
hoped
to
enter
into
a
treaty
with
the
rajah
of
that
place
on
his
way
towards
cochin
cabral
took
two
ships
belonging
to
the
moors
which
he
set
on
fire
after
taking
out
of
them
some
rice
which
they
had
on
board
on
the
of
december
the
fleet
arrived
at
cochin
which
is
nineteen
leagues
to
the
south
of
calicut
and
is
in
nine
degrees
towards
the
north
cochin
is
in
the
province
of
malabar
on
a
river
close
to
the
sea
and
is
almost
an
island
so
that
it
is
very
strong
and
difficult
of
access
having
a
large
and
safe
harbour
the
land
in
its
neighbourhood
is
low
and
intersected
by
branches
of
the
river
into
many
islands
the
city
itself
is
built
much
after
the
same
manner
with
calicut
and
is
inhabited
by
idolaters
with
a
good
many
moorish
strangers
who
come
hither
to
trade
from
many
countries
two
of
whom
were
so
rich
as
to
have
each
fifty
ships
employed
this
country
does
not
abound
in
provisions
but
produces
large
store
of
pepper
even
calicut
being
mostly
supplied
from
hence
but
as
calicut
is
greatly
more
resorted
to
by
merchants
it
is
therefore
much
richer
than
cochin
the
king
is
an
idolater
of
the
same
manners
and
customs
with
him
of
calicut
but
his
country
being
small
he
is
very
poor
and
has
not
even
the
right
to
coin
money
being
in
many
respects
subordinate
to
the
zamorin
who
on
his
accession
to
the
throne
always
goes
to
cochin
and
takes
possession
of
that
kingdom
either
retaining
it
in
his
own
hands
or
restoring
the
rajah
as
he
may
think
proper
the
rajah
of
cochin
consequently
is
bound
to
assist
the
zamorin
in
all
his
wars
and
must
always
be
of
the
same
religion
with
his
paramount
having
come
to
anchor
in
the
harbour
of
cochin
the
general
sent
one
michael
jogue
on
shore
with
a
message
to
the
rajah
as
he
feared
to
send
caspar
on
shore
lest
he
might
run
away
this
person
though
an
idolater
and
a
stranger
had
come
aboard
our
fleet
with
the
intention
of
becoming
a
christian
and
of
going
into
portugal
and
our
general
had
him
baptised
by
the
name
of
michael
he
was
ordered
to
give
the
rajah
of
cochin
an
account
of
all
that
had
happened
at
calicut
and
that
cabral
had
brought
great
store
of
merchandize
to
barter
for
the
commodities
of
cochin
or
if
the
rajah
were
not
satisfied
with
these
he
was
willing
to
give
ready
money
for
what
he
wanted
requesting
to
be
furnished
with
loading
for
four
of
his
ships
in
either
way
as
most
agreeable
to
the
rajah
to
this
message
the
rajah
made
answer
that
he
was
exceedingly
glad
of
the
arrival
of
the
portuguese
of
whose
power
and
valour
he
had
already
heard
for
which
he
esteemed
them
highly
and
that
they
were
welcome
to
purchase
what
spices
his
country
afforded
either
in
barter
for
their
goods
or
for
money
as
they
thought
proper
he
added
that
the
general
might
freely
send
any
agents
he
pleased
on
shore
to
make
purchases
and
sales
and
sent
two
principal
nayres
as
hostages
for
their
safety
conditioning
only
that
they
might
be
changed
daily
for
others
because
any
of
that
cast
who
chanced
to
eat
even
once
on
shipboard
could
never
appear
again
in
the
rajahs
presence
cabral
was
well
pleased
with
this
promising
beginning
and
immediately
appointed
gonzalo
gil
barbosa
as
factor
who
had
been
assistant
to
aries
correa
giving
him
laurenço
morena
as
clerk
and
madera
de
alcusia
as
interpreter
with
four
of
the
banished
men
as
servants
on
receiving
notice
of
the
landing
of
barbosa
the
rajah
sent
the
register
of
the
city
to
meet
him
accompanied
by
many
of
the
nayres
or
principal
men
of
the
court
who
brought
him
to
visit
the
rajah
who
was
much
inferior
in
dress
and
appearance
of
state
to
the
zamorin
even
the
hall
of
audience
having
only
bare
walls
seated
around
like
a
theatre
in
which
the
rajah
sat
with
very
few
attendants
barbosa
presented
to
the
rajah
in
name
of
our
general
a
basin
of
silver
filled
with
saffron
a
large
silver
ewer
filled
with
rose
water
and
some
branches
of
coral
which
the
rajah
received
with
much
satisfaction
desiring
his
thanks
to
be
returned
to
the
general
and
after
some
conversation
with
the
factor
and
interpreter
he
gave
orders
for
them
to
be
properly
lodged
in
the
city
the
general
gave
especial
orders
that
no
more
than
the
seven
persons
already
mentioned
should
remain
on
shore
thinking
it
imprudent
to
risk
a
greater
number
in
case
of
experiencing
a
similar
misfortune
with
what
had
lately
happened
at
calicut
but
there
was
here
no
cause
for
distrust
as
the
rajah
of
cochin
was
a
person
of
truth
and
honour
as
appeared
by
his
good
usage
of
our
men
the
quick
dispatch
that
was
used
in
loading
our
ships
with
spices
and
the
orders
he
gave
to
his
people
to
afford
every
assistance
which
they
did
with
much
alacrity
and
zeal
so
that
it
seemed
ordained
of
god
that
the
trade
should
be
transferred
from
calicut
to
cochin
for
the
advancement
of
the
catholic
faith
in
the
indies
and
the
enrichment
of
the
crown
of
portugal
after
the
ships
were
laden
two
indians
came
to
wait
upon
the
general
who
said
that
they
were
brothers
and
christians
born
in
cranganore
near
cochin
who
were
desirous
of
going
to
portugal
and
thence
to
visit
the
pope
at
rome
and
the
holy
sepulchre
at
jerusalem
being
asked
by
the
general
what
kind
of
a
city
cranganore
was
whether
it
was
entirely
inhabited
by
christians
and
whether
these
christians
followed
the
order
of
the
greek
or
roman
church
one
of
them
gave
the
following
answers
cranganore
is
a
large
city
in
the
province
of
malabar
on
the
mainland
standing
near
the
mouth
of
a
river
by
which
likewise
it
is
encompassed
inhabited
both
by
idolaters
and
christians
and
by
some
jews
who
are
held
in
small
esteem
it
is
much
frequented
by
strangers
among
whom
are
merchants
from
syria
egypt
persia
and
arabia
who
come
thither
to
purchase
pepper
a
great
deal
of
which
commodity
is
gathered
in
its
territories
it
has
a
king
of
its
own
to
whom
all
the
christian
inhabitants
pay
a
certain
tribute
and
have
a
quarter
of
their
own
in
the
city
where
they
have
a
church
resembling
ours
in
which
there
were
crosses
but
no
images
of
the
saints
and
no
bells
being
summoned
to
prayers
by
the
priests
as
in
the
greek
church
these
christians
hail
their
popes
with
twelve
cardinals
two
patriarchs
and
many
bishops
and
archbishops
all
of
whom
reside
in
armenia
to
which
country
their
bishops
always
went
for
consecration
he
had
been
there
himself
along
with
a
bishop
where
he
was
ordained
a
priest
that
this
rule
was
observed
by
all
the
clergy
of
the
indies
and
of
cathay
who
have
to
go
to
the
pope
or
catholicos
of
armenia
for
consecration
of
their
two
patriarchs
one
resides
in
the
indies
and
the
other
in
cathay
their
bishops
residing
in
different
cities
as
it
may
seem
convenient
their
tonsure
is
made
in
form
of
a
cross
the
cause
of
their
having
a
pope
is
said
to
have
been
on
the
following
account
st
peter
was
residing
at
antioch
there
happened
a
great
schism
occasioned
by
simon
magus
on
which
peter
was
called
to
rome
to
assist
the
christians
in
overthrowing
that
heresy
and
that
he
might
not
leave
the
eastern
church
without
a
shepherd
he
appointed
a
vicar
to
govern
at
antioch
who
should
become
pope
after
the
death
of
peter
and
should
always
assist
the
pope
of
armenia
but
after
the
moors
entered
into
syria
and
asia
minor
as
armenia
remained
always
in
the
christian
faith
they
came
to
be
governed
by
twelve
cardinals
marco
polo
in
writing
concerning
armenia
mentions
this
pope
or
catholicos
and
says
there
are
two
sects
of
christians
the
nestorians
and
jacobites
their
pope
being
named
jacobus
whom
this
joseph
named
their
catholicos
the
priests
of
cranganore
are
not
shaven
in
the
same
manner
with
ours
but
shave
the
whole
head
leaving
a
few
hairs
on
the
crown
and
they
have
both
deacons
and
subdeacons
in
consecrating
the
elements
they
use
leavened
bread
and
wine
made
of
raisins
having
no
other
in
the
country
their
children
are
not
baptized
till
they
are
eleven
days
old
unless
they
happen
to
be
sickly
they
confess
as
we
do
and
bury
their
dead
after
a
similar
manner
they
do
not
use
the
holy
oil
to
the
dying
but
only
bless
them
and
when
any
one
dies
they
gather
a
large
company
and
feast
for
eight
days
after
which
the
obsequies
are
celebrated
if
any
person
dies
without
making
a
testament
their
lands
and
goods
go
to
the
nearest
heir
but
the
widow
is
entitled
to
her
dower
if
she
remain
a
year
unmarried
on
going
into
church
they
use
holy
water
they
hold
the
writings
of
the
four
evangelists
in
great
veneration
they
fast
during
lent
and
advent
with
much
solemnity
and
on
easter
eve
they
neither
eat
nor
drink
the
whole
day
they
have
regularly
sermons
on
the
night
of
holy
friday
and
they
observe
the
day
of
the
resurrection
with
great
devotion
likewise
the
two
following
days
and
the
ensuing
sunday
are
particularly
kept
holy
because
on
that
day
st
thomas
thrust
his
hand
into
the
side
of
our
saviour
ascension
day
trinity
sunday
the
assumption
and
nativity
of
the
blessed
virgin
candlemas
day
christmas
day
all
the
days
of
the
apostles
and
all
the
sundays
throughout
the
year
are
kept
with
much
devotion
they
sanctify
in
a
particular
manner
the
first
day
of
july
every
year
in
honour
of
st
thomas
but
they
could
give
no
reason
why
this
was
done
they
have
also
native
friars
and
nuns
who
live
with
much
regularity
their
priests
also
live
chastely
as
those
who
do
otherwise
are
debarred
from
executing
their
functions
they
allow
of
no
divorce
between
married
people
who
must
live
together
till
death
they
receive
the
sacrament
regularly
three
times
in
every
year
they
have
among
them
certain
learned
men
or
great
doctors
who
keep
schools
in
which
they
teach
the
scriptures
and
likewise
some
excellent
interpretations
which
were
left
in
old
times
by
their
ancient
doctors
their
dress
is
similar
to
that
of
the
moors
their
day
consists
of
forty
hours
and
having
no
clocks
they
judge
of
the
time
of
the
day
by
the
sun
and
in
the
night
by
the
motion
of
the
stars
the
general
was
very
glad
to
receive
this
joseph
and
his
brother
and
gave
orders
to
provide
them
with
a
good
cabin
in
his
ship
while
cabral
remained
at
cochin
he
received
messages
from
the
kings
of
cananor
and
coulan
both
considerable
princes
in
the
province
of
malabar
requesting
him
to
come
to
their
ports
where
he
should
be
supplied
cheaper
than
at
cochin
and
giving
him
many
offers
of
friendship
he
made
answer
with
his
hearty
thanks
that
he
could
not
now
visit
their
ports
having
already
begun
to
take
in
his
loadings
bet
that
he
should
certainly
visit
them
on
his
return
to
india
immediately
after
the
portuguese
ships
were
laden
a
fleet
of
great
ships
and
other
small
vessels
was
descried
in
the
offing
and
notice
was
sent
by
the
rajah
of
cochin
to
our
general
that
this
fleet
contained
fifteen
thousand
fighting
men
and
had
been
fitted
out
on
purpose
to
make
him
and
all
his
people
prisoners
at
the
same
time
the
rajah
offered
to
send
men
to
his
assistance
if
he
stood
in
need
but
the
general
answered
he
had
no
need
of
any
such
aid
at
the
present
as
he
trusted
with
god
blessing
to
convince
his
enemies
they
were
ill
advised
in
seeking
now
to
attack
him
having
already
given
them
a
trial
of
his
strength
alluding
to
what
he
had
already
done
to
them
at
calicut
the
enemy
continued
to
hover
off
at
sea
but
did
not
venture
to
come
nearer
than
a
league
though
they
seemed
in
fighting
order
seeing
this
shyness
the
general
weighed
anchor
and
went
out
with
all
his
fleet
against
them
having
on
board
the
two
nayres
who
were
hostages
for
the
factory
on
shore
but
his
intentions
were
to
have
returned
with
them
to
cochin
soon
after
leaving
the
harbour
a
great
storm
arose
with
a
foul
wind
so
that
he
was
forced
to
come
to
anchor
without
attaining
to
the
enemy
next
morning
being
the
january
the
wind
came
fair
and
being
desirous
to
attack
the
fleet
of
calicut
the
general
made
sail
towards
them
but
missing
the
ship
commanded
by
sancho
de
toar
who
had
parted
from
the
fleet
in
the
night
and
that
being
the
largest
and
best
manned
ship
of
the
fleet
he
deemed
it
prudent
to
avoid
fighting
with
so
large
a
force
especially
as
many
of
his
men
were
sick
the
wind
likewise
was
now
quite
fair
for
beginning
his
voyage
home
and
was
quite
contrary
for
going
back
to
cochin
to
land
the
hostages
he
determined
therefore
to
commence
his
voyage
and
stood
out
to
sea
the
enemy
following
him
during
the
whole
of
that
day
but
returned
towards
calicut
when
night
drew
on
cabral
now
turned
his
attention
to
the
forlorn
nayres
who
had
been
five
days
on
board
without
eating
and
by
dint
of
much
and
kind
entreaty
he
at
length
prevailed
on
them
to
take
food
on
the
of
january
the
fleet
came
in
sight
of
cananore
which
lies
on
the
coast
of
malabar
leagues
north
of
cochin
this
is
a
large
city
with
a
fine
bay
the
houses
being
built
of
earth
and
covered
with
flat
stones
or
slates
and
it
contains
many
moors
who
trade
thither
for
many
kinds
of
goods
the
neighbourhood
produces
hardly
any
more
pepper
than
is
necessary
for
its
own
consumpt
but
has
plenty
of
ginger
cardamoms
tamarinds
mirabolans
and
other
drugs
in
several
pools
of
water
near
this
city
there
are
many
very
large
alligators
similar
to
the
crocodiles
of
the
nile
which
devour
men
when
they
come
in
their
way
they
have
very
large
heads
with
two
rows
of
teeth
and
their
breath
smells
like
musk
their
bodies
being
covered
all
over
with
hard
scales
like
shells
in
the
bushes
near
this
city
there
are
many
large
and
very
venomous
serpents
which
destroy
men
by
means
of
their
breath
there
are
bats
likewise
as
large
as
kites
which
have
heads
like
a
fox
and
similar
teeth
and
the
natives
often
eat
these
animals
the
city
of
cananore
abounds
in
fish
flesh
and
fruits
but
has
to
import
rice
from
other
places
the
king
or
rajah
is
a
bramin
being
one
of
the
three
kings
of
malabar
but
is
not
so
rich
and
powerful
as
the
zamorin
or
even
as
the
rajah
of
coulan
the
general
came
to
anchor
at
this
port
both
because
he
had
been
invited
by
the
rajah
and
because
he
wished
to
take
on
board
some
cinnamon
of
which
commodity
he
had
not
as
yet
any
on
board
he
accordingly
purchased
quintals
and
might
have
had
more
if
he
would
but
refused
it
on
which
the
people
of
the
place
concluded
that
he
had
no
more
money
on
this
coming
to
the
knowledge
of
the
rajah
he
sent
him
word
that
he
would
trust
him
with
any
quantity
he
had
a
mind
for
of
that
or
any
other
commodity
till
his
return
from
portugal
or
the
arrival
of
any
other
in
his
stead
the
rajah
was
induced
to
make
this
offer
from
his
knowledge
of
the
just
dealings
of
the
portuguese
and
their
faithful
performance
of
their
promises
the
general
sent
his
hearty
thanks
to
the
rajah
for
his
liberality
promising
to
inform
the
king
his
master
of
his
good
will
and
assuring
his
highness
that
he
might
depend
on
his
constant
friendship
cabral
now
took
on
board
an
ambassador
from
the
rajah
of
cananore
for
the
king
of
portugal
who
was
sent
to
conclude
a
treaty
of
amity
between
them
departing
from
cananore
and
standing
across
the
gulf
he
took
a
great
ship
richly
laden
on
the
last
of
january
but
on
learning
that
it
belonged
to
the
king
of
cambaya
he
permitted
it
to
proceed
on
its
voyage
uninjured
sending
word
to
that
sovereign
that
the
portuguese
did
not
come
to
the
indies
to
make
war
on
any
one
excepting
indeed
with
the
zamorin
of
calicut
who
had
scandalously
broken
the
peace
which
had
been
made
between
them
he
therefore
only
took
a
pilot
out
of
this
ship
to
conduct
him
through
the
gulf
between
india
and
africa
while
continuing
their
voyage
and
approaching
the
african
shore
a
great
storm
arose
on
the
of
february
by
which
in
the
night
the
ship
of
sancho
de
toar
was
driven
on
shore
and
taking
fire
was
entirely
burnt
the
men
only
being
saved
as
the
tempest
still
continued
they
were
unable
to
stop
at
melinda
or
any
other
place
till
they
came
to
mozambique
where
they
cast
anchor
in
order
to
take
in
water
and
to
refit
their
ships
the
seams
of
which
were
all
open
from
this
place
the
general
dispatched
sancho
de
toar
to
discover
sofala
with
orders
to
make
the
best
of
his
way
from
that
place
to
portugal
with
an
account
of
its
productions
the
ships
being
refitted
cabral
resumed
the
voyage
to
the
cape
of
good
hope
near
which
they
again
experienced
a
violent
storm
in
which
one
of
the
ships
was
separated
from
the
fleet
after
firing
signals
of
distress
and
was
never
seen
again
during
the
voyage
at
length
after
many
great
storms
and
dangers
which
it
were
tedious
to
recount
cabral
doubled
the
cape
on
whitsunday
the
of
may
whence
continuing
his
voyage
with
a
fair
wind
he
came
to
anchor
at
cape
verd
where
he
found
diego
diaz
who
had
separated
from
the
fleet
on
the
outward
bound
voyage
diaz
had
been
driven
into
the
red
sea
where
he
wintered
and
lost
his
boat
and
as
most
of
his
men
died
from
sickness
his
pilot
could
not
venture
to
carry
him
to
india
he
endeavoured
therefore
to
find
his
way
back
to
portugal
but
after
leaving
the
red
sea
his
men
were
so
consumed
with
hunger
thirst
and
sickness
that
only
seven
of
his
crew
remained
after
remaining
some
time
at
cape
verd
waiting
in
vain
for
the
missing
ships
cabral
proceeded
on
his
voyage
and
arrived
safe
at
lisbon
on
the
last
day
of
july
in
the
year
soon
after
his
arrival
the
ship
which
had
separated
in
a
storm
off
the
cape
of
good
hope
came
in
and
shortly
after
that
sancho
de
toar
arrived
from
sofala
he
described
sofala
as
a
small
island
close
on
the
continent
of
africa
inhabited
by
a
black
people
called
caffres
and
reported
that
much
gold
is
brought
to
this
place
from
certain
mines
on
the
adjacent
continent
on
which
account
sofala
is
much
frequented
by
moors
from
india
who
barter
merchandize
of
small
value
for
gold
he
brought
along
with
him
to
lisbon
a
moor
whom
he
had
received
as
an
hostage
or
pledge
for
the
safety
of
one
of
his
own
men
whom
he
had
left
there
to
acquire
a
knowledge
of
the
country
and
its
language
and
from
this
moor
they
got
ample
information
respecting
the
people
and
trade
of
those
parts
of
africa
which
i
shall
afterwards
communicate
including
this
last
ship
there
returned
six
to
portugal
out
of
the
twelve
which
had
sailed
on
the
voyage
for
india
the
other
six
having
been
lost
it
will
appear
in
the
sequel
that
there
was
another
captain
named
vasco
de
e
astley
says
only
astl
i
according
to
astley
there
were
eight
franciscan
friars
besides
the
vicar
eight
chaplains
and
a
and
that
their
orders
were
to
begin
with
preaching
and
in
case
that
failed
to
enforce
the
gospel
by
the
sword
in
other
words
to
establish
the
accursed
tribunal
of
the
inquisition
in
india
to
the
eternal
disgrace

unaccountable
mistake

of
castaneda

lichefild
says
to
the
e
it
appears
that
cabral
had
twenty
malefactors
on
board
for
such
purposes

had
received
pardon

this

of

derived
its
name
from

originally
according
to
castaneda
there
were
only
ten
ships
and
two
caravels
both
the
caravels
have
been
already
accounted
for
as
having
left
the
fleet
and
after
the
loss
of
four
ships
six
only
ought
to
have
remained
astley
makes
the
whole
fleet
originally
to
have
consisted
of
thirteen
vessels
which
will
allow
of
seven
now
remaining
this
part
of
the
voyage
is
very
indistinctly
described
from
the
lat
of
where
cabral
is
said
to
have
fallen
in
with
the
eastern
coast
of
africa
to
sofala
in
lat
the
coast
stretches
out
nearly
five
degrees
to
the
east
to
capes
corientes
and
st

with
many
rivers
the
great
bays
of
delogoa
and
asnea
and
the
islands
of
bocica
or
bozarnio
all
of
which
must
have
been
seen
by
cabral
during
the
slow
navigation
close
along
shore
but
all
of
which
are
omitted
in
the
e
named
inhazato
sofala
is
in
lat
and
almost
from

according
to
de
faria
this
person
was
uncle
to
the
king
of
melinda

was
named
sheikh

b
in
modern
maps

divided
into
the

separate
territories
inhambane
sabia
sofala
mocaranga
mozambico
and
querimba
which
will
be
illustrated
in
future
portions
of
this
e
this
word
is
probably
an
error
of
the
press
for
mylyo
by
which
the
african
grain
named
millet
is
distinguished
in
other
parts
of
castaneda
the
of
the

are
probably
meant
for
sheep
as
they
are
frequently
thus
contradistinguished
in
other
parts
of
the
original
from
not
here
e
these
vessels
were
probably
precisely
similar
to
the
arab
of
the
red
sea
and
persian
gulf
which
will
be
afterwards
more
particularly

thus
the
translation
of

lichefild

more
probably
a
superstitious
ceremony

without
great
difficulty
and
was
taken
possession

sixty
astl
i
according
to
de
faria
this
event
was
occasioned
by
the
moorish
admiral
of
calicut
without
the
knowledge
of
the
zamorin
who
instigated
cabral
to
the
attempt
in
hope
of
injuring
the
portuguese
and
sent
information
to
the
moors
to
be
on
their
guard
he
adds
that
cabral
having
discovered
the
fraud
restored
the
ship
and
cargo
to
the
owners
whom
he
satisfied
for
their
damages
in
order
to
gain
the
favour
of
the
rajah

by
lichefild
instead
of

be
some

in

the

by
the
conduct
of
the
zamorin
on
several
accounts
and
among
the
rest
for
monopolising
the
trade
on
the
malabar
astl
i
a
we
may
easily
conceive
that
one
strong
ground
of
favour
to
the
portuguese
at
cochin
was
in
hopes
by
their
means
to
throw
off

yoke

joseph

whose
name
there
is
a
short
voyage
in
grynæus
which
properly
speaking
is
only
an
account
of
cranganore
and
its
inhabitants

the
christians

their
ceremonies

in
lichefilds
translation
the
account
of
the
day
of
these
indian
christians
runs
thus
which
we
do
not
pretend
to
understand
they
have
their
day
which
they
do
call
which
is
of
hours
this
account
of
the
christians
found
in
india
by
the
portuguese
is
exceedingly
imperfect
and
unsatisfactory
but
it
would
lead
to
a
most
inconvenient
length
to
attempt
supplying
the
deficiency
those
of
our
readers
who
are
disposed
to
study
this
interesting
subject
will
find
it
discussed
at
some
length
in
mosheim
and
there
is
a
good
abstract
relative
to
these
oriental
sects

by
gibbon
in
the
decline
and
fall
of

is
an
article
entitled
account
of
india
by
joseph
an
indian
christian
who
accompanied
cabral
a
to
lisbon
in
we
were
inclined
to
have
inserted
this
account
at
this
part
of
our
collection
as
an
ancient
and
original
document
but
on
an
attentive
perusal
it
is
so
jejune
contused
and
uninstructive
as
not
to
merit
attention
it
evidently
appears
to
have
been
penned
by
some
person
in
cabral
ship
during
the
voyage
home
from
repeated
conferences
with
joseph
but
as
the
writer
of
this
article
informs
us
himself
many
particulars
were
unknown
to
joseph
because
he
had
little
intercourse
with
the
idolaters
or
because
the
reporter
could
not
understand
the
answers
which
joseph
made

to

been
settled
amicably
at
calicut
by
cabral
and
that
a
regular
trade
was
established
both
there
and
at
sofala
and
quiloa
the
king
of
portugal
dispatched
three
ships
and
a
caravel
from
lisbon
under
the
command
of
john
de
neuva
a
native
of
galicia
in
spain
who
was
accounted
a
valiant
gentleman
having
under
his
orders
francisco
de
navoys
diego
barboso
and
hernando
de
la
pyna
as
captains
of
three
of
the
ships
two
ships
of
this
fleet
were
destined
to
carry
merchandize
to
sofala
and
the
other
two
to
calicut
and
all
the
four
contained
only
eighty
men
the
instructions
given
to
nueva
were
that
he
was
to
touch
at
the
island
of
st
blas
where
he
was
to
wait
ten
days
if
any
of
his
ships
had
separated
he
was
then
to
proceed
for
sofala
where
if
a
factory
were
settled
he
was
to
deliver
the
goods
destined
for
that
place
before
going
to
india
if
a
factory
were
not
already
settled
there
he
was
to
do
every
thing
in
his
power
for
that
purpose
leaving
alvaro
de
braga

as
factor
with
the
merchandize
embarked
in
the
caravel
for
that
market
from
sofala
he
was
to
proceed
to
quiloa
and
thence
directly
to
calicut
he
was
farther
directed
in
case
of
meeting
with
cabral
to
obey
him
as
general
and
desire
him
to
settle
a
factory
at
sofala
if
his
own
attempt
should
fail
nueva
left
lisbon
on
this
voyage
in
march
four
months
before
the
return
of
cabral
and
arrived
in
safety
at
the
isle
of
st
blas
where
he
found
a
letter
in
an
old
shoe
suspended
from
the
branch
of
a
tree
written
by
pedro
de
tayde
informing
him
that
the
fleet
of
cabral
had
passed
this
island
on
its
way
back
to
portugal
and
giving
an
account
of
what
had
happened
at
calicut
of
the
good
treatment
the
fleet
had
received
at
cochin
where
some
of
our
men
remained
and
of
the
friendly
disposition
of
the
king
of
cananor
on
consulting
with
the
other
captains
it
was
judged
improper
to
leave
the
caravel
at
sofala
in
these
circumstances
as
their
whole
force
did
not
exceed
eighty
men
wherefore
they
proceeded
directly
for
quiloa
where
they
found
one
of
the
exiles
who
had
been
left
there
by
cabral
from
whom
they
received
a
particular
account
of
all
that
had
happened
at
calicut
and
of
the
loss
of
several
of
his
ships
all
of
which
he
had
learnt
from
some
moors
from
quiloa
nueva
sailed
on
to
melinda
where
the
king
confirmed
the
intelligence
he
had
received
from
the
exile
at
quiloa
thus
fully
instructed
in
the
state
of
matters
nueva
deemed
it
prudent
to
keep
all
the
ships
of
his
small
squadron
and
sailed
across
from
melinda
to
anchediva
where
he
came
to
anchor
in
november
intending
to
take
in
a
supply
of
water
at
that
place
while
here
seven
large
ships
belonging
to
cambaya
which
were
bound
for
the
red
sea
appeared
off
the
anchoring
ground
and
seemed
at
first
disposed
to
attack
our
ships
but
being
afraid
of
the
portuguese
ordnance
they
continued
their
voyage
from
anchediva
nueva
proceeded
for
cananor
where
he
had
an
audience
of
the
rajah
from
whom
he
received
particular
notice
of
all
that
had
happened
in
calicut
to
cabral
and
of
the
offer
which
the
rajah
had
made
to
load
all
his
ships
at
cananor
the
rajah
assured
him
of
his
earnest
desire
of
doing
every
thing
in
his
power
to
serve
the
king
of
portugal
and
pressed
him
to
take
in
his
loading
at
that
port
but
nueva
declined
this
offer
for
the
present
until
he
had
consulted
with
the
factor
at
cochin
for
which
port
he
took
his
departure
from
cananor
on
his
way
between
cananor
and
cochin
nueva
took
a
ship
belonging
to
some
of
the
moorish
merchants
at
calicut
after
a
vigorous
resistance
and
set
it
on
fire
on
his
arrival
at
cochin
the
factor
who
had
been
left
there
by
cabral
came
on
board
with
the
rest
of
his
company
and
acquainted
him
that
the
rajah
was
greatly
offended
with
cabral
for
leaving
the
port
without
seeing
him
and
for
carrying
away
the
hostages
yet
had
always
kindly
entertained
and
the
other
members
of
the
factory
lodging
them
every
night
in
the
palace
for
security
and
always
sending
a
guard
of
nayres
along
with
any
of
them
who
had
occasion
to
go
out
during
the
day
on
purpose
to
defend
them
from
the
moors
who
sought
their
destruction
and
who
had
one
night
set
fire
to
the
house
in
which
they
lodged
before
their
removal
to
the
palace
he
also
informed
nueva
that
the
moors
had
persuaded
the
native
merchants
to
depreciate
the
price
of
the
portuguese
merchandize
and
not
to
take
these
in
exchange
for
pepper
so
that
unless
he
had
brought
money
for
his
purchases
he
would
have
little
chance
of
procuring
a
loading
on
this
intelligence
and
considering
that
he
had
not
brought
money
nueva
immediately
returned
from
cochin
to
cananor
expecting
to
procure
his
loading
at
that
port
in
consequence
of
the
friendly
dispositions
of
the
rajah
towards
the
king
of
portugal
on
his
return
to
cananor
he
found
that
money
was
as
necessary
there
for
his
purchases
as
at
cochin
but
when
the
rajah
was
informed
of
his
difficulties
from
want
of
money
he
became
his
security
to
the
native
merchants
for
quintals
or
hundred
weights
of
pepper
quintals
of
cinnamon
and
fifty
quintals
of
ginger
besides
some
bales
of
linen
cloth
by
this
generous
conduct
of
the
rajah
nueva
procured
a
loading
for
his
ships
and
left
his
european
merchandize
for
sale
at
cananor
under
the
management
of
a
factor
and
two
clerks
on
the
december
while
waiting
for
a
fair
wind
to
begin
his
homeward
voyage
the
rajah
sent
notice
to
nueva
that
eighty
were
seen
to
the
northward
which
were
past
mount
and
that
these
vessels
were
from
calicut
sent
expressly
to
attack
the
portuguese
ships
and
the
rajah
advised
him
to
land
his
men
and
ordnance
for
greater
security
but
the
general
was
not
of
this
mind
and
sent
word
to
the
rajah
that
he
hoped
with
the
assistance
of
god
to
be
able
to
defend
himself
next
day
being
the
of
december
before
dawn
about
an
hundred
ships
and
paraws
full
of
moors
came
into
the
bay
sent
on
purpose
by
the
zamorin
who
was
in
hopes
to
have
taken
all
our
ships
and
men
as
soon
as
nueva
perceived
this
numerous
armament
he
hoisted
anchor
and
removed
his
squadron
to
the
middle
of
the
bay
where
he
ordered
all
his
ships
to
pour
in
their
shot
against
the
enemy
without
intermission
doubtless
but
for
this
the
enemy
would
have
boarded
his
ships
and
they
were
so
numerous
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
have
escaped
but
as
the
moors
had
no
ordnance
they
could
do
our
people
no
harm
from
a
distance
and
many
of
their
ships
and
paraws
were
sunk
with
the
loss
of
a
vast
number
of
men
while
they
did
not
dare
to
approach
for
the
purpose
of
boarding
and
not
a
single
person
was
killed
or
hurt
on
our
side
the
enemy
towards
evening
hung
out
a
flag
for
a
parley
but
as
nueva
feared
this
might
be
intended
as
a
lure
he
continued
firing
lest
they
might
suppose
he
stopped
from
weariness
or
fear
but
the
moors
were
really
desirous
of
peace
owing
to
the
prodigious
loss
they
had
sustained
and
their
inability
to
escape
from
the
bay
for
want
of
a
fair
wind
at
length
most
of
his
ordnance
being
burst
or
rendered
unserviceable
by
the
firing
and
seeing
that
the
moors
still
kept
up
their
flag
of
truce
nueva
ceased
firing
and
answered
them
by
another
flag
immediately
on
this
a
moor
came
to
neuva
in
a
small
boat
to
demand
a
cessation
of
hostilities
till
next
day
this
was
granted
on
condition
that
they
should
quit
the
bay
and
put
out
to
sea
which
they
did
accordingly
although
the
wind
was
very
unfavourable
nueva
stood
out
to
sea
likewise
which
the
enemy
could
hardly
do
as
their
ships
and
paraws
can
only
make
sail
with
a
fair
wind
notwithstanding
all
that
had
happened
nueva
was
constrained
to
come
to
anchor
close
to
the
fleet
of
the
enemy
and
gave
orders
to
keep
strict
watch
during
the
night
at
one
time
they
were
heard
rowing
towards
our
fleet
and
it
was
supposed
they
intended
setting
our
ships
on
fire
on
which
neuva
ordered
to
veer
out
more
cable
to
get
farther
off
perceiving
that
the
boats
of
the
enemy
continued
to
follow
he
commanded
a
gun
to
be
fired
at
them
on
which
they
made
off
and
the
wind
coming
off
shore
and
somewhat
fair
they
made
sail
for
calicut
nueva
after
returning
thanks
to
god
for
deliverance
from
his
enemies
took
his
leave
of
the
rajah
of
cananor
and
departed
for
portugal
where
he
arrived
in
safety
with
all
his
ships
after
the
departure
of
nueva
from
cananor
one
of
his
men
named
gonsalo
pixoto
who
had
been
made
prisoner
and
carried
to
calicut
came
to
cananor
with
a
message
from
the
zamorin
to
nueva
making
excuses
for
all
that
had
been
done
there
to
cabral
and
for
the
attempt
against
his
own
fleet
at
cananor
and
offering
if
he
would
come
to
calicut
to
give
him
a
full
loading
of
spices
and
sufficient
hostages
both
for
his
safety
and
the
performance
of
his
promise
it
afterwards
appears
that
one
vessel
only
was
destined
for
this
particular
trade
perhaps
the
second

meant
for

took

felt
it
incumbent
upon
him
to

the
injurious
and
treacherous
conduct
of
the

gave
orders
to
prepare
a
powerful
fleet
for
that
purpose
the
command
of
which
was
at

confided
to

which
sailed
on
the
of

under
the
command
of
stephen
de

when
de
gama
had
doubled
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
was
arrived
at
farther
end
of
the
he
went
himself
with
four
of
the
smallest
vessels
to
sofala
sending
on
the
remainder
of
the
fleet
to
wait
his
arrival
at
mozambique
this
visit
to
sofala
was
in
consequence
of
orders
from
the
king
to
examine
the
situation
of
the
city
and
to
endeavour
to
find
a
proper
situation
for
a
fort
that
the
portuguese
might
monopolize
the
trade
in
gold
at
that
place
he
remained
there
days
during
which
he
settled
a
treaty
of
amity
with
the
king
and
had
leave
to
establish
a
factory
after
which
mutual
presents
were
interchanged
and
de
gama
departed
for
mozambique
in
going
out
of
the
river
from
sofala
one
of
the
ships
was
lost
but
all
the
men
were
saved
at
mozambique
he
made
friendship
with
the
king
who
had
proved
so
unfriendly
in
the
first
voyage
and
even
obtained
leave
to
settle
a
factor
with
several
assistants
who
were
left
on
purpose
to
provide
victuals
for
such
ships
as
might
touch
here
on
the
voyage
to
or
from
india
here
likewise
the
caravel
destined
for
that
purpose
was
set
up
and
provided
with
ordnance
and
a
sufficient
crew
and
was
left
for
the
protection
of
the
factory
on
leaving
mozambique
de
gama
sailed
for
quiloa
having
orders
to
reduce
the
king
of
that
place
to
become
tributary
as
a
punishment
for
his
unfriendly
conduct
towards
cabral
on
his
arrival
in
that
port
ibrahim
the
king
came
on
board
to
visit
the
admiral
afraid
of
being
called
to
account
for
the
injuries
he
had
done
to
cabral
de
gama
knowing
that
he
was
not
to
be
trusted
threatened
to
make
him
a
prisoner
under
the
hatches
if
he
did
not
immediately
agree
to
pay
tribute
to
the
king
of
portugal
the
king
from
fear
engaged
to
pay
miticals
of
gold
yearly
and
gave
one
mehemed
aleones
a
principal
man
among
the
moors
whom
he
hated
as
an
hostage
for
the
payment
the
reason
of
his
dislike
to
mehemed
was
this
ibrahim
was
himself
an
usurper
having
seized
the
government
in
prejudice
to
the
right
heir
and
was
afraid
that
mehemed
intended
to
dethrone
him
when
the
king
found
himself
at
liberty
in
consequence
of
this
arrangement
he
refused
to
send
the
promised
tribute
in
hope
that
de
gama
might
put
the
hostage
to
death
by
which
means
he
might
get
rid
of
his
enemy
but
the
moor
on
finding
the
tribute
did
not
come
was
fain
to
pay
the
same
himself
by
which
means
he
procured
his
own
liberty
while
at
quiloa
the
fleet
was
joined
by
the
squadron
of
five
ships
under
stephen
de
gama
leaving
quiloa
de
gama
proceeded
with
the
whole
fleet
for
melinda
where
he
took
in
water
and
visited
the
king
going
from
thence
for
india
and
being
arrived
off
mount
dely
to
the
north
of
cananor
he
met
a
ship
belonging
to
the
moors
of
mecca
and
bound
for
calicut
which
was
taken
by
our
men
after
a
stout
resistance
when
the
ship
surrendered
de
gama
went
on
board
and
commanded
the
owners
and
all
the
principal
moors
to
come
before
him
whom
he
ordered
to
produce
all
their
goods
on
pain
of
being
thrown
overboard
they
answered
that
they
had
nothing
to
produce
as
all
their
goods
were
in
calicut
on
which
de
gama
ordered
one
of
them
to
be
bound
hand
and
foot
and
thrown
into
the
sea
the
rest
were
intimidated
by
this
procedure
and
immediately
delivered
up
every
thing
belonging
to
them
which
was
very
valuable
all
of
which
was
committed
to
the
charge
of
diego
hernando
correa
the
factor
appointed
for
conducting
the
trade
at
cochin
by
whose
directions
they
were
transported
into
one
of
the
portuguese
ships
de
gama
ordered
all
the
children
belonging
to
the
moors
to
be
taken
on
board
one
of
his
own
ships
and
vowed
to
make
them
all
friars
in
the
church
of
our
lady
at
belem
which
he
afterwards
did
all
the
ordinary
merchandize
belonging
to
the
moors
was
divided
among
his
own
men
and
when
all
the
goods
were
removed
he
ordered
stephen
de
la
gama
to
confine
the
moors
under
the
hatches
and
to
set
the
ship
on
fire
to
revenge
the
death
of
the
portuguese
who
were
slain
in
the
factory
at
calicut
soon
after
this
was
done
the
moors
broke
open
the
hatches
and
quenched
the
fire
on
which
the
admiral
ordered
stephen
de
gama
to
lay
them
aboard
the
moors
rendered
desperate
by
this
inhuman
treatment
defended
themselves
to
the
utmost
and
even
threw
firebrands
into
our
ship
to
set
it
on
fire
night
coming
on
stephen
had
to
desist
but
was
ordered
to
watch
the
moorish
ship
carefully
that
it
might
not
escape
during
the
dark
and
the
moors
all
night
long
were
heard
calling
on
mahomet
to
deliver
them
out
of
the
hands
of
the
christians
when
day
appeared
the
admiral
again
ordered
stephen
de
la
gama
to
set
the
ship
on
fire
which
he
did
accordingly
after
forcing
the
moors
to
retreat
into
the
poop
some
of
the
moors
leapt
into
the
sea
with
hatchets
in
their
hands
and
endeavoured
to
swim
to
our
boats
but
all
of
these
were
slain
in
the
water
by
our
people
and
those
that
remained
in
the
ship
were
all
drowned
as
the
vessel
sunk
of
moors
of
whom
thirty
were
women
not
one
escaped
alive
and
some
of
our
men
were
hurt
de
gama
came
soon
afterwards
to
cananor
where
he
sent
on
shore
the
ambassadors
and
gave
them
a
message
for
the
king
informing
him
of
his
arrival
and
craving
an
audience
upon
this
the
rajah
ordered
a
platform
of
timber
to
be
constructed
which
projected
a
considerable
way
into
the
water
covered
over
with
carpets
and
other
rich
cloths
and
having
a
wooden
house
or
pavilion
at
the
end
next
the
land
which
was
likewise
covered
like
the
bridge
and
was
meant
for
the
place
of
meeting
between
the
rajah
and
the
admiral
the
rajah
came
first
to
the
pavilion
attended
by
nayres
and
with
many
trumpets
and
other
instruments
playing
before
him
and
a
number
of
the
principal
nayres
were
arranged
on
the
bridge
or
platform
to
receive
the
admiral
in
an
honourable
manner
the
admiral
came
in
his
boat
attended
by
all
the
boats
of
the
fleet
decked
out
with
flags
and
streamers
carrying
certain
ordnance
in
their
prows
and
having
many
drums
and
trumpets
making
a
very
martial
appearance
the
admiral
disembarked
at
the
outer
end
of
the
platform
under
a
general
salute
from
the
ordnance
of
the
boats
and
was
accompanied
by
all
his
captains
and
a
number
of
men
well
armed
there
were
carried
before
him
two
great
basins
of
silver
gilt
filled
with
branches
of
coral
and
other
fine
things
that
are
esteemed
valuable
in
india
the
admiral
was
received
at
the
head
of
the
platform
by
the
nayres
placed
there
on
purpose
and
was
conducted
to
the
rajah
who
waited
for
him
at
the
door
of
the
pavilion
and
welcomed
him
with
an
embrace
they
then
walked
together
into
the
pavilion
in
which
two
chairs
were
placed
out
of
compliment
to
the
admiral
on
one
of
which
the
rajah
sat
down
though
contrary
to
his
usual
custom
and
desired
the
admiral
to
be
seated
on
the
other
at
this
interview
a
treaty
of
friendship
and
commerce
was
settled
and
a
factory
allowed
to
be
established
at
cananor
in
consequence
of
this
the
admiral
gave
orders
for
some
of
the
ships
to
load
here
while
others
were
to
do
the
same
at
cochin
having
settled
all
things
to
his
mind
at
cananor
and
cochin
the
admiral
proceeded
with
his
fleet
to
the
harbour
of
calicut
where
he
took
several
paraws
in
which
were
about
fifty
malabars
who
could
not
escape
but
he
forbore
making
any
farther
hostilities
against
the
city
till
he
might
see
whether
or
not
the
zamorin
would
send
him
any
message
soon
afterwards
there
came
a
boat
with
a
flag
to
the
admirals
ship
a
which
was
a
person
in
the
habit
of
a
franciscan
friar
who
was
taken
at
first
sight
for
one
of
those
who
had
accompanied
ayres
correa
and
who
they
supposed
had
remained
a
prisoner
on
entering
the
ship
he
saluted
them
saying
but
was
immediately
recognized
as
a
moor
he
excused
himself
for
coming
in
that
disguise
to
secure
permission
of
getting
on
board
and
said
that
he
brought
a
message
from
the
zamorin
to
the
admiral
about
settling
a
trade
in
calicut
to
this
the
admiral
made
answer
that
he
would
by
no
means
treat
on
this
subject
unless
the
zamorin
would
previously
satisfy
him
for
all
the
goods
which
had
been
seized
in
the
factory
when
he
consented
to
the
death
of
correa
and
the
rest
who
were
there
slain
on
this
subject
three
days
were
spent
ineffectually
in
messages
between
the
zamorin
and
the
admiral
as
the
moors
used
every
influence
to
prevent
any
friendly
agreement
at
length
perceiving
that
all
these
messages
were
only
meant
to
gain
time
the
admiral
sent
notice
to
the
zamorin
that
he
would
wait
no
longer
than
noon
for
his
final
answer
and
if
that
were
not
perfectly
satisfactory
and
in
compliance
with
his
just
demands
he
might
be
assured
he
would
wage
cruel
war
against
him
with
fire
and
sword
and
would
begin
with
those
of
his
subjects
who
were
now
prisoners
in
his
hands
and
that
the
zamorin
might
not
think
these
were
only
words
of
course
he
called
for
an
which
he
set
down
in
presence
of
the
moorish
messenger
saying
that
as
soon
as
the
sand
had
run
out
a
certain
number
of
times
he
would
infallibly
put
in
execution
all
that
he
had
threatened
all
this
however
could
not
induce
the
zamorin
to
perform
his
promise
for
he
was
of
an
inconstant
and
wavering
disposition
and
influenced
by
the
counsels
of
the
moors
the
outward
shew
he
had
made
of
peace
was
only
feigned
or
occasioned
by
the
fear
he
had
of
seeing
so
great
a
fleet
in
his
port
from
which
he
dreaded
to
sustain
great
injury
but
the
moors
had
now
persuaded
him
into
a
contrary
opinion
and
had
prevailed
on
him
to
break
his
word
when
the
time
appointed
by
the
admiral
was
expired
he
ordered
a
gun
to
be
fired
as
a
signal
to
the
captains
of
his
ships
to
hang
up
the
poor
malabar
prisoners
who
had
been
distributed
through
the
fleet
after
they
were
dead
he
ordered
their
hands
and
feet
to
be
cut
off
and
sent
on
shore
in
a
paraw
accompanied
by
two
boats
well
armed
and
placed
a
letter
in
the
paraw
for
the
zamorin
written
in
arabic
in
which
he
signified
that
he
proposed
to
reward
him
in
this
manner
for
his
deceitful
conduct
and
repeated
breach
of
faith
and
in
regard
to
the
goods
belonging
to
the
king
of
portugal
which
he
detained
he
would
recover
them
an
hundred
fold
after
this
the
admiral
ordered
three
of
his
ships
to
be
warped
during
the
night
as
near
as
possible
to
the
shore
and
that
these
should
fire
next
day
incessantly
on
the
city
with
all
their
cannon
by
which
vast
injury
was
done
and
the
royal
palace
was
entirely
demolished
besides
several
other
houses
belonging
to
the
principal
inhabitants
of
the
place
the
admiral
afterwards
departed
for
cochin
leaving
vincente
sodre
with
six
well
armed
ships
to
command
the
coast
who
was
to
remain
in
india
when
the
rest
of
the
fleet
returned
to
portugal
and
was
likewise
directed
to
go
upon
a
voyage
of
discovery
to
the
straits
of
mecca
and
the
coast
of
cambaya
from
calicut
the
admiral
sailed
for
cochin
and
immediately
on
his
anchoring
in
that
port
the
rajah
sent
on
board
certain
hostages
to
remain
as
his
sureties
and
when
the
admiral
landed
the
rajah

and
declaring
his
satisfaction
at
the
settlement
of
a
factory
for
trade
at
cochin
the
admiral

crimson
satin
and
another
of
sendal
all
of
which
the
rajah
accepted
with
much
satisfaction
yet
not
knowing
the
use
of
some
of
these
things
the
admiral
endeavoured
to
explain
them
and
particularly
ordered
the
pavilion
to
be
set
up
to
shew
its
use
under
which
a
new
treaty
of
amity
was
settled
the
rajah
appointed
a
house
for
the
use
of
the
portuguese
factory
and
a
schedule
of
prices
were
agreed
upon
at
which
the
various
spices
drugs
and
other
productions
of
the
country
were
to
be
delivered
to
the
portuguese
factors
all
of
which
were
set
down
in
writing
in
form
of
a
contract
the
rajah
likewise
delivered
present
for
the
king
of
portugal
consisting
of
two
gold
bracelets
set
with
precious
stones
a
sash
or
turban
used
by
the
moors
of
cloth
of
silver
two
yards
and
a
half
long
two
great
pieces
of
fine
bengal
cotton
cloth
and
a
stone
as
large
as
a
walnut
taken
from
the
head
of
an
animal
called
which
is
exceedingly
rare
and
is
said
to
be
an
antidote
against
all
kipds
of
poison
a
convenient
house
being
appointed
for
a
factory
was
immediately
taken
possession
of
by
diego
hernandez
as
factor
lorenzo
moreno
and
alvaro
vas
as
clerks
and
several
other
assistants
while
the
ships
were
taking
in
their
cargoes
at
cochin
a
message
was
brought
to
the
admiral
from
the
zamorin
engaging
if
he
would
return
to
calicut
to
make
a
complete
restitution
of
every
thing
that
had
been
taken
from
the
portuguese
and
that
a
treaty
of
friendship
and
commerce
would
be
immediately
arranged
between
them
after
considering
this
message
the
admiral
ordered
the
messenger
to
prison
meaning
to
take
revenge
on
him
in
case
the
zamorin
should
prove
deceitful
in
this
instance
as
he
had
already
been
in
many
others
after
this
precaution
he
went
to
calicut
more
for
the
purpose
of
endeavouring
to
recover
the
merchandize
than
from
any
expectation
of
procuring
the
friendship
of
the
zamorin
for
this
reason
he
took
only
his
own
ship
leaving
stephen
de
gama
in
the
command
at
cochin
in
his
absence
the
captains
of
the
fleet
were
much
averse
to
this
rashness
yet
could
not
persuade
him
to
take
a
larger
force
as
he
said
he
would
be
sufficiently
protected
by
the
squadron
of
vincente
sodre
which
was
cruizing
on
the
coast
whom
he
could
join
on
any
emergency
on
his
arrival
at
calicut
the
zamorin
immediately
sent
notice
that
he
would
satisfy
him
next
day
for
all
the
goods
which
had
been
taken
from
cabral
and
would
afterwards
renew
the
trade
and
settle
the
factory
on
a
proper
footing
but
as
soon
as
he
understood
that
the
admiral
had
come
with
so
small
a
force
he
commanded
paraws
to
be
got
in
readiness
with
all
expedition
for
the
purpose
of
taking
his
ship
and
so
unexpectedly
did
these
assail
him
that
the
admiral
was
forced
to
cut
one
of
his
cables
and
make
out
to
seaward
which
he
was
fortunately
enabled
to
do
as
the
wind
came
off
from
the
land
yet
the
paraws
pursued
him
so
closely
that
he
must
infallibly
have
been
taken
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
squadron
of
sodre
making
its
appearance
on
sight
of
which
the
paraws
gave
over
the
chase
and
retired
to
calicut
on
his
return
to
cochin
die
admiral
immediately
ordered
the
messenger
of
the
zamorin
to
be
hanged
the
failure
of
this
treacherous
attempt
against
de
gama
gave
much
concern
to
the
zamorin
who
now
resolved
to
try
if
he
could
induce
the
rajah
of
cochin
to
refuse
a
loading
to
the
portuguese
and
to
send
away
their
factory
from
his
port
with
this
view
he
transmitted
a
letter
to
that
prince
in
the
following
terms
i
am
informed
that
you
favour
the
christians
whom
you
have
admitted
into
your
city
and
supplied
with
goods
and
provisions
it
is
possible
you
may
not
see
the
danger
of
this
procedure
and
may
not
know
how
displeasing
it
is
to
me
i
request
of
you
to
remember
the
friendship
which
has
hitherto
subsisted
between
us
and
that
you
now
incur
my
displeasure
for
so
small
a
matter
in
supporting
these
christian
robbers
who
are
in
use
to
plunder
the
countries
belonging
to
other
nations
my
desire
is
therefore
that
for
the
future
you
may
neither
receive
them
into
your
city
nor
give
them
spices
by
which
you
will
both
do
me
a
great
pleasure
and
will
bind
me
to
requite
your
friendship
in
whatever
way
you
may
desire
i
do
not
more
earnestly
urge
these
things
at
the
present
being
convinced
you
will
comply
without
further
entreaty
as
i
would
do
for
you
in
any
matter
of
importance
the
rajah
of
cochin
answered
in
the
following
terms
that
he
knew
not
how
to
expel
the
christians
from
his
city
whom
he
had
received
as
friends
and
to
whom
he
had
passed
his
word
for
trade
and
amity
he
denied
that
his
friendly
reception
of
the
christians
could
be
construed
as
any
offence
to
the
zamorin
as
it
was
the
custom
in
the
ports
of
malabar
to
favour
all
merchants
who
resorted
thither
for
trade
and
declared
his
resolution
to
maintain
his
engagements
inviolate
to
the
portuguese
who
had
brought
great
sums
of
gold
and
silver
and
large
quantities
of
merchandize
into
his
dominions
in
the
course
of
their
trade
the
zamorin
was
much
offended
by
this
answer
of
the
rajah
of
cochin
to
whom
he
wrote
a
second
time
advising
him
earnestly
to
abandon
the
portuguese
if
he
had
any
respect
for
his
own
welfare
the
rajah
of
cochin
was
not
to
be
moved
either
by
the
persuasions
or
threatening
of
the
zamorin
and
sent
a
reply
to
his
second
letter
in
which
he
declared
he
should
never
be
induced
to
commit
a
base
or
treacherous
action
by
fear
of
the
consequences
and
was
resolved
to
persist
in
maintaining
his
treaty
of
trade
and
amity
with
the
portuguese
finding
that
he
could
not
prevail
on
the
rajah
of
cochin
to
concur
with
him
he
commanded
large
ships
to
be
fitted
out
in
order
to
assail
the
portuguese
fleet
when
on
its
return
homewards
expecting
that
he
should
be
able
to
destroy
them
with
more
ease
when
fully
laden
the
rajah
of
cochin
gave
no
intimation
to
the
admiral
of
the
letters
and
messages
which
had
been
interchanged
between
him
and
the
zamorin
until
he
went
to
take
leave
at
which
time
he
declared
he
would
hazard
the
loss
of
his
dominions
to
serve
the
king
of
portugal
the
admiral
after
many
expressions
of
gratitude
for
his
friendly
disposition
and
honourable
regard
for
his
engagements
assured
him
that
the
king
his
master
would
never
forget
the
numerous
demonstrations
he
had
given
of
friendship
and
would
give
him
such
assistance
as
should
not
only
enable
him
to
defend
his
own
dominions
but
to
reduce
other
countries
under
his
authority
he
desired
him
not
to
be
in
fear
of
the
zamorin
against
whom
there
should
henceforwards
be
carried
on
so
fierce
war
that
he
would
have
enough
of
employment
in
defending
himself
instead
of
being
able
to
attack
others
in
this
the
general
alluded
to
the
aid
which
the
rajah
might
expect
from
the
ships
that
were
to
remain
in
india
under
the
command
of
vincent
sodre
all
this
conversation
took
place
in
presence
of
many
of
the
principal
nayres
of
which
circumstance
the
rajah
was
much
pleased
as
he
knew
these
people
were
in
friendship
with
the
moors
and
had
opposed
the
grant
of
a
factory
to
us
at
cochin
having
completed
the
loading
of
ten
ships
the
admiral
sailed
from
cochin
on
his
voyage
and
when
about
three
leagues
from
pandarane
he
descried
the
moorish
fleet
of
large
ships
coming
towards
him
after
consulting
with
the
captains
of
his
fleet
and
the
wind
being
favourable
for
the
purpose
he
immediately
bore
down
to
engage
them
the
ships
commanded
by
vincente
sodre
pedro
raphael
and
diego
perez
being
prime
sailers
closed
up
first
with
the
enemy
and
immediately
attacked
two
of
the
largest
ships
of
the
moors
sodre
fought
with
one
of
these
alone
and
raphael
and
perez
assailed
the
other
almost
on
the
first
onset
great
numbers
of
the
enemies
were
so
dismayed
that
they
leapt
into
the
sea
to
escape
by
swimming
on
the
coming
up
of
de
gama
with
the
rest
of
the
fleet
all
the
enemies
ships
made
off
as
fast
as
they
could
towards
the
shore
except
those
two
which
were
beset
at
the
first
and
were
unable
to
escape
which
were
accordingly
taken
possession
of
de
gama
considering
that
all
his
ships
were
richly
laden
would
not
pursue
the
flying
enemy
being
afraid
he
might
lose
some
of
his
ships
on
the
shoals
but
our
men
went
in
their
boats
and
slew
about
of
the
moors
who
had
endeavoured
to
save
themselves
by
swimming
from
the
two
captured
ships
these
vessels
were
accordingly
discharged
of
their
cargoes
which
consisted
of
great
quantities
of
rich
merchandize
among
which
were
six
great
jars
of
fine
earthen
ware
called
porcelain
which
is
very
rare
and
costly
and
much
admired
in
portugal
four
large
vessels
of
silver
and
many
silver
perfuming
pans
also
many
spitting
basons
of
silver
gilt
but
what
exceeded
all
the
rest
was
a
golden
idol
of
thirty
pounds
weight
with
a
monstrous
face
the
eyes
of
this
image
were
two
very
fine
emeralds
the
vestments
were
of
beaten
gold
richly
wrought
and
set
with
precious
stones
and
on
the
breast
was
a
large
carbuncle
or
ruby
as
large
as
the
coin
called
a
crusado
which
shone
like
fire
the
goods
being
taken
out
the
two
ships
were
set
on
fire
and
the
admiral
made
sail
for
cananor
where
the
rajah
gave
him
a
house
for
a
factory
in
which
gonzalo
gill
barbosa
was
settled
as
factor
having
sebastian
alvarez
and
diego
godino
as
clerks
duarte
barbosa
as
interpreter
and
sundry
others
as
assistants
in
all
to
the
number
of
twenty
the
rajah
undertook
to
protect
these
men
and
all
that
might
be
left
in
the
factory
and
bound
himself
to
supply
lading
in
spices
to
all
the
ships
of
the
king
of
portugal
at
certain
fixed
prices
in
return
for
these
favourable
conditions
the
admiral
engaged
on
behalf
of
the
king
of
portugal
to
defend
the
rajah
in
all
wars
that
might
arise
from
this
agreement
conditioning
for
peace
and
friendship
between
the
rajahs
of
cochin
and
cananor
and
that
the
latter
should
give
no
aid
to
any
one
who
might
make
war
upon
the
former
under
the
pain
of
forfeiting
the
friendship
of
the
portuguese
after
this
the
admiral
gave
orders
to
vincente
sodre
to
protect
the
coast
with
his
squadron
till
the
month
of
february
and
if
any
war
should
break
out
or
seem
probable
between
the
zamorin
and
trimumpara
he
was
to
winter
in
cochin
for
the
protection
of
that
city
otherwise
he
was
to
sail
for
the
straits
of
the
red
sea
to
make
prize
of
all
the
ships
belonging
to
mecca
that
traded
to
the
indies
all
these
matters
being
properly
arranged
de
gama
departed
from
cananor
for
portugal
on
the
december
with
thirteen
ships
richly
laden
three
of
which
had
taken
in
their
cargoes
at
cananor
and
the
other
ten
at
cochin
the
whole
fleet
arrived
in
safety
at
mozambique
where
the
ship
commanded
by
stephen
de
gama
having
sprung
a
great
leak
was
unladen
and
laid
on
shore
to
be
repaired
seven
days
after
their
departure
from
mozambique
the
ship
commanded
by
lewis
cotinho
sprung
a
great
leak
and
they
were
forced
to
endeavour
to
return
to
mozambique
to
repair
her
but
the
wind
being
contrary
they
had
to
do
this
in
a
creek
on
the
coast
continuing
their
voyage
they
were
assailed
by
a
sudden
tempest
off
cape
corientes
in
which
the
ship
commanded
by
stephen
de
gama
had
her
sails
all
split
by
the
storm
owing
to
which
she
was
separated
from
the
fleet
and
no
more
seen
till
six
days
after
the
arrival
of
the
admiral
at
lisbon
when
she
came
in
with
her
mast
broken
the
storm
having
abated
during
which
the
fleet
took
shelter
under
the
lee
of
cape
corientes
the
admiral
prosecuted
his
voyage
to
lisbon
and
arrived
safe
at
cascais
on
the
september
all
the
noblemen
of
the
court
went
to
cascais
to
receive
him
honourably
and
to
accompany
him
to
the
presence
of
the
king
on
his
way
to
court
he
was
preceded
by
a
page
carrying
a
silver
bason
in
which
was
the
tribute
from
the
king
of
quiloa
the
king
received
him
with
great
honour
as
he
justly
merited
for
his
services
in
discovering
the
indies
and
in
settling
factories
at
cochin
and
cananor
to
the
great
profit
of
the
kingdom
besides
the
great
fame
and
honour
which
redounded
to
the
king
as
the
first
sovereign
who
had
sent
to
discover
the
indies
of
which
he
might
make
a
conquest
if
he
were
so
inclined
in
reward
for
these
brilliant
services
the
king
made
him
admiral
of
the
indies
and
likewise
gave
him
the
title
of
lord
of
videgueyra
which
was
his
own
as
de
gama
did
not
return
again
to
india
till
the
year
which
is
beyond
the
period
contained
in
that
part
of
castaneda
which
has
been
translated
by
lichefild
we
shall
have
no
occasion
to
notice
him
again
in
this
part
of
our
work
for
this
reason
it
has
been
thought
proper
to
give
the
following
short
supplementary
account
of
his
farther
services
in
india
in
don
vasco
de

appointed
viceroy
of

with
fourteen
ships
carrying
fighting
men
three
were
lost
during
the
voyage
with
all
the
men
belonging
to
two
of
them
while
in
the
gulf
of
cambaya
in
a
dead
calm
the
ships
were
tossed
about
in
so
violent
a
manner
that
all
onboard
believed
themselves
in
imminent
danger
of
perishing
and
began
to
consider
how
they
might
escape
one
man
leapt
thinking
to
escape
by
swimming
but
was
drowned
and
such
as
lay
sick
of
fevers
were
cured
by
the
fright
the
viceroy
who
perceived
that
the
commotion
was
occasioned
by
the
effects
of
an
earthquake
called
aloud
to
his
people
my
friends
for
the
sea
trembles
from
fear
of
you
who
are
on
to
make
some
amends
for
the
misfortunes
of

of

belonging
to
mecca

a
large
sum
in
those
days
after
his
arrival
at
goa
the
viceroy
visited
some
forts
and
issued
the
necessary
orders
for
regulating
the
affairs
of
his
government
but
he
had
not
time
to
put
any
of
his
great
designs
into
execution
as
he
died
on
christmas
eve
having
only
held
the
government
of
portuguese

for
three
months
de
gama
is
said
to
have
been
of
middle
stature
with
a
ruddy
complexion
but
somewhat
gross
his
character
was
bold
patient
under
fatigue
well
fitted
for
great
undertakings
speedy
in
executing
justice
and
terrible
in
anger
in
fine
he
was
admirably
fitted
for
all
that
was
entrusted
to
his
conduct
as
a
discoverer
a
naval
and
military
commander

i
b
according
to
astley
much
difference
of
opinion
took
place
in
the
council
of
portugal
whether
to
continue
the
trade
to
india
for
which
it
was
requisite
to
employ
force
or
to
desist
entirely
from
the
attempt
but
the
profits
expected
from
the
trade
and
the
expectation
of
propagating
the
romish
religion
and
enlarging
the
royal
titles
outweighed
all
considerations
of
danger
and
it
was
resolved
to
persist
in
the
astl
i
the
distribution
of
this
force
is
somewhat
differently
related
by
astley
ten
ships
only
are
said
to
have
been
placed
under
the
immediate
command
of
vasco
de
gama
five
ships
under
vincente
sodre
who
had
orders
to
scour
the
coast
of
cochin
and
cananor
and
to
watch
the
mouth
of
the
red
sea
on
purpose
to
prevent
the
moors
or
turks
and
arabs
from
trading
to
india
the
third
as
in
the
text
was
under
stephen
de

with
no
particular
destination
mentioned
and
the
whole
were
under
the
supreme
command
of
vasco
de
gama
as
astl
i
such
is
the
expression
in
the
translation
by
lichefild
but
which
i
suspect
ought
to
have
been
and
had
passed
cape
e
in
astley
the
following
incident
is
mentioned
when
off
cape
verd
vasco
de
gama
met
a
caravel
bound
from
la
mina
on
the
western
coast
of
africa
carrying
much
gold
to
lisbon
he
shewed
some
of
this
to
the
ambassadors
whom
cabral
had
brought
from
cananor
and
who
were
now
on
their
return
to
india
they
expressed
much
surprize
at
this
circumstance
as
they
had
been
told
by
the
venetian
ambassador
at
lisbon
that
the
portuguese
could
not
send
their
ships
to
sea
without
assistance
from
venice
this
insinuation
proceeded
from
envy
as
the
venetians
were
afraid
of
losing
the
lucrative
trade
with
india
which
they
had
long
enjoyed
through
egypt

to

forced
beyond

took
in

at
a

eight
leagues
farther
on

going
thence
towards
india
he
spread
out
his
fleet
that
no
ship
might
escape
him

consequence
of
which
he
took
several
but
was
most
severe
on
those
belonging

in

this
ship
is
said
to
have
belonged
to

very
richly
laden

being
full
of
moors
of
quality

were
going
on

says
there
were
twenty
of

christian
friars
to
make
amends
for
one
portuguese
who
turned

castaneda

rather
his
translator

somewhat
confused

if

settled
at

the
whole

deservedly

this
messenger
was
a
bramin
who
left
his
son

at

in

to
the
narrative
of

de

maffi
and
de

relate
that
ambassadors
came
to
de
gama
while
at
cochin
from
the
christian
inhabitants
in
cranganore
and
that
neighbourhood
who
they
said
amounted
to
they
represented
that
they
knew
he
was
an
officer
of
the
most
catholic
king
in
europe
to
whom
they
submitted
themselves
in
testimony
of
which
they
delivered
into
his
hands
the
rod
of
justice
of
a
red
colour
tipped
with
silver
at
both
ends
and
about
the
length
of
a
sceptre
having
three
bells
at

top
they
complained
of
being
much
oppressed
by
the
idolaters
and
were
dismissed
by
de

with
promises
of
a
powerful
and
speedy
astl

de
faria
alleges
that
the
persons
who
were
appointed
to
settle
matters
relative
to
trade
at
this
port
differed
much
upon
the
price
of
spices
on
which
occasion
many
threatening
messages
were
sent
to
the
rajah
who
at
length
through
fear
complied
with
all
the
demands
of
the
portuguese
he
says
that
the
rajahs
of
cochin
and
cananor
were
as
refractory
and
adverse
at
first
as
the
zamorin
and
that
when
de
gama
arrived
at
cochin
the
three
princes
combined
to
make
him
winter
there
by
fraud
and
joined
their
fleets
to
destroy
him
that
on
the
failure
of
this
combination
a
durable
peace
was
made
with
trimumpara
and
the
rajah
of
cananor
fearing
the
portuguese
might
not
return
to
his
port
sent
word
to
de
gama
that
he
was
ready
to
comply
with
all
his
demands
astl
i
a
in
castaneda
this
date
is
made
but
from
an
attentive
consideration
of
other
dates
and
circumstances
in
that
author
this
must
have
been
a
typographical
e
section
vi
of
the
portuguese
in
india
from
the
departure
of
de
gama
in
december
to
the
arrival
of
alonzo
de
albuquerque
in
as
soon
as
the
zamorin
was
assured
of
the
departure
of
de
gama
for
europe
he
determined
on
putting
his
threats
in
execution
against
the
rajah
of
cochin
for
which
purpose
he
gathered
an
army
at
the
village
of
panani
not
far
from
cochin
this
was
soon
known
to
the
inhabitants
of
cochin
who
were
exceedingly
afraid
of
the
great
power
of
the
zamorin
and
were
much
dissatisfied
with
their
sovereign
for
incurring
the
displeasure
of
that
prince
out
of
respect
to
the
christians
whom
they
inveighed
against
with
much
bitterness
on
all
occasions
and
openly
insulted
wherever
they
were
seen
some
that
were
in
high
credit
with
the
rajah
said
openly
that
as
the
zamorin
was
much
more
powerful
than
their
state
our
men
ought
to
be
delivered
up
to
him
as
the
war
was
entirely
on
our
account
for
whom
the
kingdom
ought
not
to
be
put
in
hazard
but
the
rajah
much
offended
at
these
people
declared
that
he
was
resolved
to
defend
the
portuguese
against
the
zamorin
trusting
that
god
would
favour
him
in
so
just
a
cause
yet
many
of
his
subjects
were
much
inclined
to
have
seized
the
portuguese
belonging
to
the
factory
but
durst
not
as
the
rajah
gave
them
a
place
of
considerable
strength
to
dwell
in
and
appointed
a
guard
for
their
security
at
this
time
vincente
sodre
arrived
with
his
squadron
in
the
bay
of
cochin
after
having
done
much
damage
on
the
coast
of
calicut
both
by
land
and
sea
the
portuguese
head
factor
sent
laurenzo
moreno
to
inform
sodre
of
the
preparations
which
were
making
by
the
zamorin
for
the
attack
of
cochin
and
requiring
him
in
the
name
of
the
king
of
portugal
to
land
with
his
men
for
its
defence
but
sodre
answered
that
his
orders
were
to
defend
the
sea
and
not
the
land
for
which
reason
if
the
zamorin
had
prepared
to
attack
cochin
by
sea
he
would
certainly
have
defended
it
but
as
the
war
was
to
be
carried
on
by
land
he
could
not
interfere
and
the
rajah
must
defend
himself
the
factor
sent
a
second
message
entreating
him
in
the
name
of
god
and
on
his
allegiance
to
the
king
of
portugal
not
to
abandon
the
factory
in
this
state
of
danger
as
the
power
of
the
rajah
was
inadequate
to
defend
cochin
against
the
zamorin
and
as
the
sole
object
of
the
war
was
for
the
destruction
of
the
factory
and
the
ruin
of
the
portuguese
trade
it
certainly
was
his
duty
as
for
the
king
of
portugal
in
these
seas
both
to
defend
the
factory
and
to
give
every
assistance
in
his
power
to
the
rajah
but
sodre
was
immoveable
pretending
that
he
had
been
ordered
to
discover
the
red
sea
where
he
expected
to
make
many
rich
prizes
and
set
sail
from
cochin
for
cape
guardafui
preferring
the
hope
of
riches
to
his
duty
in
defending
the
factory
of
cochin
the
zamorin
collected
his
army
as
already
mentioned
at
the
village
of
panani
where
besides
his
own
subjects
and
allies
several
of
the
principal
subjects
of
the
rajah
of
cochin
joined
his
standard
deserting
their
own
sovereign
and
carrying
along
with
them
all
the
power
they
were
able
to
muster
among
these
were
the
caimalls
or
governors
of
chirapipil
and
cambalane
and
of
the
large
island
which
is
opposite
to
the
city
of
cochin
at
this
place
the
zamorin
made
a
long
speech
to
his
assembled
chiefs
in
which
he
endeavoured
to
justify
his
enmity
to
the
portuguese
whom
he
represented
as
thieves
robbers
and
pirates
and
as
having
first
commenced
hostilities
against
him
without
cause
he
contrasted
the
quiet
and
friendly
conduct
of
the
moors
who
had
traded
for
years
with
malabar
having
never
done
injury
to
any
in
all
that
time
and
had
greatly
enriched
the
country
and
had
raised
his
city
of
calicut
to
be
the
greatest
emporium
in
all
the
indies
whereas
the
portuguese
had
taken
and
destroyed
his
ships
made
his
ambassadors
prisoners
insisted
on
having
their
ships
laden
before
those
belonging
to
the
moors
had
taken
a
ship
of
the
moors
burnt
ten
of
his
ships
in
his
own
harbour
had
destroyed
his
city
and
forced
him
to
escape
for
safety
from
his
palace
taking
law
and
vengeance
for
pretended
grievances
into
their
own
hands
instead
of
applying
regularly
to
him
for
redress
and
since
the
rajah
of
cochin
was
fully
informed
of
all
these
things
yet
persisted
in
favouring
the
portuguese
in
despite
of
all
remonstrances
he
had
resolved
to
make
war
upon
him
to
deprive
him
of
his
dominions
and
to
drive
these
christian
intruders
out
of
india
this
address
gave
much
satisfaction
to
all
the
assembled
chiefs
and
most
especially
to
the
lord
of
repelim
who
entertained
a
rooted
enmity
against
the
rajah
of
cochin
who
had
dispossessed
him
of
an
island
called
arrnuul
the
only
person
who
opposed
the
zamorin
on
this
occasion
was
nambeadarin
who
was
brother
and
next
heir
to
the
zamorin
he
strongly
urged
the
impolicy
of
driving
the
christians
from
malabar
to
which
merchants
resorted
from
all
places
of
the
world
seeing
that
the
portuguese
had
made
richer
presents
to
the
zamorin
than
he
had
ever
received
before
and
had
brought
much
gold
and
silver
into
the
country
for
the
purchase
of
commodities
which
was
not
usually
done
by
such
as
came
to
make
war
he
represented
the
attempt
of
the
hostages
to
escape
who
had
been
given
for
the
safety
of
the
portuguese
chief
and
whom
the
zamorin
was
pleased
to
call
ambassadors
as
the
first
cause
of
jealousy
and
distrust
yet
they
were
afterwards
reconciled
and
took
the
large
moorish
ship
at
the
desire
of
the
zamorin
to
whom
they
presented
the
great
elephant
he
said
their
conduct
in
trade
and
otherwise
while
in
calicut
was
quite
satisfactory
to
all
except
the
moors
who
were
envious
against
them
for
interfering
in
their
trade
and
accused
them
falsely
of
taking
pepper
against
the
will
of
the
owners
which
in
fact
they
had
done
themselves
to
prevent
the
christians
from
loading
their
ships
nay
that
this
was
so
evident
that
even
the
zamorin
had
licensed
the
portuguese
to
take
the
pepper
from
the
moorish
vessels
after
which
the
moors
had
risen
against
them
slaying
their
men
and
seizing
all
their
goods
yet
after
all
these
outrages
they
had
given
the
zamorin
a
whole
day
in
which
to
offer
reparation
and
had
not
sought
revenge
of
their
injuries
treacherously
like
the
moors
that
he
saw
no
cause
of
going
to
war
against
the
rajah
of
cochin
for
receiving
the
portuguese
into
his
city
like
any
other
merchants
who
might
frequent
his
harbour
as
had
likewise
been
done
by
the
rajahs
of
cananor
and
koulan
who
would
not
have
done
so
if
they
had
been
robbers
and
pirates
and
if
the
zamorin
meant
to
drive
the
portuguese
from
the
indies
besides
making
war
on
cochin
it
would
be
necessary
for
him
to
do
the
same
against
canauor
and
all
the
other
princes
on
the
coast
the
zamorin
was
a
good
deal
staggered
by
the
discourse
of
nambendarin
who
had
much
credit
and
authority
with
him
insomuch
that
it
is
thought
he
would
have
desisted
from
prosecuting
the
war
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
moors
and
the
caymals
who
represented
that
it
would
be
a
great
disgrace
to
his
character
to
recede
after
the
assemblage
of
so
great
an
army
and
that
it
was
to
be
expected
the
rajah
of
cochin
might
now
agree
from
fear
to
do
what
the
zamorin
had
desired
him
the
zamorin
then
desired
his
sorcerers
to
point
out
a
fortunate
day
for
marching
forward
with
his
army
which
they
did
accordingly
and
promised
him
an
assured
victory
with
this
assurance
on
which
he
placed
great
reliance
the
zamorin
departed
from
panani
and
took
possession
of
repelim
which
is
four
leagues
from
cochin
the
rajah
of
cochin
had
regular
intelligence
of
all
that
passed
in
the
camp
of
the
zamorin
by
means
of
spies
and
was
in
great
trouble
respecting
the
event
not
having
sufficient
force
for
his
defence
as
many
on
whom
he
most
relied
had
gone
over
to
the
enemy
even
those
who
remained
served
against
their
inclination
more
especially
the
inhabitants
of
cochin
who
abhorred
our
people
and
said
openly
that
it
were
proper
the
rajah
should
either
deliver
them
up
to
the
zamorin
or
send
them
away
from
cochin
to
avoid
the
impending
war
many
of
the
inhabitants
of
cochin
deserted
the
place
for
fear
of
the
consequences
the
members
of
the
portuguese
factory
were
much
alarmed
by
all
these
circumstances
and
requested
permission
from
the
rajah
to
withdraw
to
cananor
where
they
might
remain
in
safety
till
the
arrival
of
the
next
fleet
from
portugal
hoping
by
this
means
to
remove
the
cause
of
war
and
to
satisfy
the
subjects
of
the
rajah
trimumpara
was
displeased
at
this
request
as
not
reposing
sufficient
confidence
in
his
word
and
declared
he
would
rather
forfeit
his
kingdom
and
even
his
life
than
deliver
them
up
to
the
zamorin
or
any
other
who
sought
to
injure
them
and
that
although
he
might
lose
cochin
in
the
war
there
still
were
places
of
sufficient
strength
in
which
to
keep
them
safe
till
reinforcements
should
arrive
from
portugal
that
although
the
zamorin
had
a
great
army
yet
victory
did
not
always
follow
numbers
as
a
few
valiant
men
were
often
victorious
over
great
odds
especially
having
justice
on
their
side
he
therefore
desired
the
factory
to
remain
and
to
pray
god
to
give
him
the
victory
the
portuguese
now
offered
to
give
him
such
aid
as
their
small
number
would
allow
but
he
declined
allowing
them
to
expose
themselves
to
any
danger
on
the
present
occasion
as
his
credit
depended
upon
the
preservation
of
their
lives
that
they
might
witness
for
his
faithful
adherence
to
the
treaty
of
amity
which
he
had
formed
with
their
nation
upon
this
he
placed
them
under
the
safeguard
of
certain
naires
in
whom
he
had
confidence
after
this
the
rajah
called
all
his
nobles
into
his
presence
together
with
the
chief
naires
who
were
the
cause
of
all
the
murmurs
against
the
portuguese
and
addressed
the
assemblage
to
the
following
effect
i
am
much
concerned
to
find
that
truth
and
loyalty
should
be
wanting
among
men
of
your
quality
i
do
not
wonder
at
the
present
misconduct
of
the
lower
orders
who
are
often
constrained
by
their
poverty
and
wretchedness
to
commit
all
manner
of
wickedness
but
that
naires
who
have
always
been
noted
for
fidelity
should
desire
me
to
forfeit
the
promise
which
i
have
made
to
the
in
behalf
of
the
portuguese
to
defend
them
to
the
utmost
of
my
power
against
all
violence
as
my
own
subjects
astonishes
and
distresses
me
beyond
measure
under
these
assurances
of
protection
which
were
given
with
your
consent
these
men
were
left
in
my
city
and
yet
because
you
see
the
zamorin
coming
against
me
with
more
men
than
i
have
you
would
have
me
to
break
my
promise
were
i
so
unjust
you
of
all
men
ought
to
abhor
me
if
you
dwelt
with
any
sovereign
on
the
assurance
of
his
word
how
would
you
conceive
of
him
if
he
were
to
treat
you
as
you
would
now
have
me
to
act
by
these
christians
is
it
because
you
are
afraid
of
the
great
power
of
the
zamorin
be
assured
it
were
better
for
us
all
to
die
in
the
discharge
of
our
duty
and
the
preservation
of
our
promise
than
to
live
dishonoured
to
me
no
evil
can
be
greater
than
to
break
my
word
nor
can
there
be
a
greater
dishonour
to
yourselves
than
to
be
the
subjects
of
a
false
and
treacherous
king
these
christians
have
brought
much
profit
to
me
and
my
country
and
the
zamorin
might
have
kept
them
in
his
own
city
if
he
had
permitted
their
factory
to
settle
there
in
peace
were
it
his
intention
to
drive
the
christians
out
of
india
and
to
make
war
on
all
who
receive
them
into
their
dominions
he
ought
to
have
begun
this
war
with
the
rajah
of
cananor
but
his
cause
of
war
is
the
envy
he
has
conceived
at
seeing
me
benefited
by
the
trade
which
he
has
lost
through
his
own
misconduct
and
because
he
believes
in
his
pride
that
i
am
unable
to
withstand
but
i
trust
in
god
and
the
justness
of
my
cause
that
with
your
assistance
i
shall
obtain
the
victory
and
shall
be
able
to
protect
the
christians
and
preserve
my
honour
inviolate
this
speech
had
great
effect
upon
the
assembled
naires
who
were
astonished
at
the
constancy
and
resolution
of
the
rajah
they
all
therefore
craved
pardon
for
the
fears
they
had
entertained
and
promised
to
live
and
die
in
his
service
the
rajah
immediately
called
the
factor
and
the
rest
of
the
portuguese
into
his
presence
to
whom
he
gave
an
account
of
all
that
had
taken
place
between
him
and
the
naires
and
named
before
them
the
prince
his
brother
and
next
heir
as
general
of
the
army
which
was
destined
to
act
against
the
forces
of
the
zamorin
commanding
every
one
to
obey
him
in
every
respect
as
if
he
were
himself
present
naramuhin
accordingly
marched
with
naires
and
entrenched
himself
at
the
ford
which
forms
the
only
entry
by
land
into
the
island
of
cochin
and
which
is
only
deep
at
low
water
when
the
zamorin
received
notice
of
the
army
of
cochin
having
taken
post
at
this
ford
he
was
somewhat
afraid
more
especially
as
he
knew
naramuhin
was
considered
to
be
the
bravest
and
most
fortunate
warrior
in
malabar
he
therefore
made
a
fresh
attempt
to
induce
the
rajah
of
cochin
to
accede
to
his
demands
of
delivering
up
the
portuguese
and
their
goods
otherwise
threatening
to
conquer
his
dominions
and
to
put
all
the
inhabitants
to
the
sword
although
the
rajah
of
cochin
was
quite
sensible
of
the
inferiority
of
his
military
force
and
was
convinced
what
the
zamorin
threatened
might
readily
happen
he
yet
determined
to
remain
firm
to
his
engagements
and
sent
the
following
answer
if
you
had
required
with
civility
what
you
have
proudly
commanded
me
i
should
not
have
esteemed
your
valour
lessened
by
your
courtesy
for
with
men
of
wisdom
and
power
there
is
no
need
for
insolent
vaunts
i
have
not
as
yet
so
sinned
against
god
that
i
should
humble
myself
to
vain
boasting
or
think
that
he
should
grant
you
the
victory
over
me
and
those
brave
men
who
fight
on
my
side
in
spite
of
all
your
pride
i
trust
even
with
the
small
number
i
have
to
defend
me
in
my
just
quarrel
that
i
shall
be
enabled
to
overcome
you
and
all
my
enemies
however
much
you
may
have
practised
deceit
and
injustice
it
has
ever
been
my
rule
to
avoid
shame
and
dishonour
and
i
will
never
consent
to
deliver
up
the
christians
or
their
goods
which
i
have
engaged
to
defend
the
zamorin
was
much
offended
by
this
answer
from
the
rajah
of
cochin
and
vowed
to
destroy
his
whole
country
in
revenge
leaving
therefore
the
isle
of
repelim
on
the
last
day
of
march
he
entered
on
the
territories
of
cochin
yet
refrained
from
doing
any
injury
as
he
now
occupied
those
parts
which
belonged
to
the
chieftains
who
had
joined
him
against
their
own
sovereign
on
the
of
march
the
army
of
the
zamorin
made
an
attempt
to
force
a
passage
by
the
ford
which
was
defended
by
prince
naramuhin
yet
in
spite
of
all
his
prodigious
superiority
of
numbers
he
was
forced
to
retire
with
considerable
loss
disappointed
in
this
first
essay
the
zamorin
encamped
close
by
the
ford
and
sent
the
lord
of
repelim
next
day
with
a
still
stronger
force
than
had
been
employed
in
the
first
assault
to
attempt
forcing
the
passage
he
even
joined
several
armed
paraws
in
this
attack
but
naramuhin
made
a
resolute
defence
in
which
he
was
bravely
seconded
by
laurenzo
moreno
and
several
other
portuguese
and
effectually
resisted
every
effort
of
the
zamorins
troops
who
were
obliged
to
retreat
with
much
loss
several
such
assaults
were
made
on
the
ford
in
all
of
which
the
zamorin
lost
many
men
and
was
constantly
repulsed
insomuch
that
he
became
fearful
of
a
sinister
end
to
his
unjust
enterprise
and
even
repented
of
having
begun
the
war
he
sent
however
a
fresh
message
to
the
rajah
requiring
him
to
deliver
up
the
christians
as
a
preliminary
of
peace
but
the
rajah
replied
that
as
he
had
refused
to
do
so
unjust
an
action
when
he
had
some
reason
to
dread
the
superior
power
of
the
zamorin
it
was
absurd
to
expect
any
such
thing
now
when
the
advantage
in
the
war
was
evidently
of
his
side
he
then
advised
the
zamorin
to
beware
of
continuing
the
war
as
he
would
not
now
satisfy
himself
with
defence
but
even
hoped
to
give
him
a
signal
overthrow
and
this
certainly
had
been
the
case
if
the
subjects
of
the
rajah
had
not
shamefully
deserted
him
in
this
war
and
given
assistance
to
the
enemy
the
zamorin
almost
despaired
of
success
and
would
have
given
over
the
enterprize
if
he
had
not
been
advised
by
some
of
his
chiefs
to
assail
several
other
towns
belonging
to
the
dominions
of
cochin
so
as
to
distract
the
attention
of
naramuhin
and
to
weaken
his
force
by
obliging
him
to
send
detachments
for
their
defence
but
that
brave
prince
provided
against
every
emergency
and
made
so
judicious
a
disposition
of
his
forces
that
he
repulsed
every
effort
of
the
enemy
and
slew
many
of
their
men
foiled
in
every
attempt
with
severe
loss
by
the
bravery
and
excellent
dispositions
of
prince
naramuhin
the
zamorin
corrupted
the
paymaster
of
the
troops
of
cochin
who
changed
the
usual
order
of
payment
which
had
been
daily
made
in
the
camp
and
obliged
the
soldiers
to
come
up
to
cochin
for
that
purpose
naramuhin
was
obliged
to
submit
to
this
arrangement
by
giving
leave
to
the
naires
to
go
for
their
wages
yet
charged
them
punctually
to
return
to
the
camp
before
day
but
the
treacherous
paymaster
kept
them
waiting
till
after
by
which
means
the
prince
was
left
with
very
few
troops
to
defend
the
ford
taking
advantage
of
this
concerted
stratagem
the
zamorin
made
an
assault
upon
the
ford
with
his
whole
force
by
sea
and
land
and
constrained
naramuhin
to
retire
with
his
small
band
into
a
grove
of
palm
trees
where
he
was
surrounded
by
the
whole
army
of
calicut
yet
fought
the
whole
day
against
such
terrible
odds
with
the
utmost
resolution
several
times
throwing
his
enemies
into
disorder
of
whom
many
were
slain
but
at
length
overpowered
by
numbers
he
and
two
of
his
cousins
who
fought
along
with
him
were
slain
together
with
most
of
his
faithful
followers
when
this
melancholy
event
was
announced
to
the
rajah
of
cochin
he
fainted
from
extreme
grief
and
was
for
some
time
thought
to
have
actually
expired
at
this
time
the
naires
were
much
exasperated
against
our
men
to
whom
they
attributed
the
overthrow
and
death
of
prince
naramuhin
and
the
desperate
situation
of
their
country
and
seemed
much
inclined
to
have
put
the
portuguese
to
death
or
to
have
delivered
them
up
to
the
zamorin
on
the
recovery
of
the
rajah
and
learning
the
designs
of
his
people
against
our
men
he
called
the
portuguese
into
his
presence
he
gave
them
assurance
that
even
this
reverse
of
his
affairs
should
not
alter
his
resolution
of
protecting
them
both
against
the
zamorin
and
his
own
subjects
he
then
addressed
his
assembled
naires
urging
them
not
to
stain
his
honour
and
their
own
by
injuring
the
portuguese
whom
he
and
they
had
sworn
to
protect
he
exhorted
them
to
persevere
honourably
and
bravely
in
defending
their
country
and
preserving
their
honour
inviolate
to
the
christians
and
comforted
them
with
the
assurance
that
the
portuguese
fleet
would
soon
arrive
with
sufficient
reinforcements
to
drive
out
the
zamorin
and
to
restore
him
to
his
dominions
in
the
meantime
he
proposed
that
they
should
retire
with
what
force
remained
into
the
isle
of
vaipi
which
was
of
difficult
access
and
where
they
could
defend
themselves
till
the
arrival
of
the
portuguese
fleet
more
especially
as
the
winter
was
at
hand
which
would
stop
the
progress
of
the
war
for
some
time
the
naires
were
astonished
at
the
resolution
of
their
sovereign
and
promised
faithfully
to
obey
his
commands
in
all
things
the
zamorin
made
a
new
attempt
to
shake
the
resolution
of
the
rajah
in
his
present
adversity
by
offering
peace
on
condition
of
delivering
up
the
portuguese
and
their
goods
which
the
rajah
rejected
with
disdain
as
he
had
done
all
his
former
overtures
on
this
the
zamorin
gave
orders
to
destroy
the
whole
country
with
fire
and
sword
on
which
intelligence
most
of
the
inhabitants
of
cochin
withdrew
to
other
places
there
were
at
this
time
in
cochin
two
milanese
lapidaries
belonging
to
the
factory
named
john
maria
and
pedro
antonio
who
had
been
brought
to
india
by
vasco
de
gama
these
men
deserted
to
the
zamorin
to
whom
they
conveyed
intelligence
of
the
consternation
which
reigned
among
the
inhabitants
of
cochin
and
of
the
small
number
of
men
that
remained
with
the
rajah
these
men
also
made
offer
to
the
zamorin
to
make
ordnance
for
him
resembling
those
of
the
portuguese
which
they
afterwards
did
as
will
appear
in
the
sequel
of
this
history
and
for
which
service
they
were
highly
rewarded
the
zamorin
now
moved
forwards
with
his
army
to
take
possession
of
cochin
and
was
resisted
for
some
time
by
the
rajah
who
was
himself
slightly
wounded
but
finding
it
impossible
any
farther
to
resist
against
such
prodigious
odds
he
withdrew
to
the
strong
island
of
vaipi
carrying
all
our
men
along
with
him
and
every
thing
belonging
to
our
factory
the
zamorin
on
taking
possession
of
the
deserted
city
of
cochin
ordered
it
to
be
set
on
fire
he
then
sent
a
part
of
his
army
against
the
isle
of
vaipi
which
was
valiantly
defended
by
the
rajah
and
his
men
and
in
which
defence
the
members
of
our
factory
contributed
to
the
best
of
their
ability
but
the
winter
coming
on
and
bad
weather
setting
in
the
zamorin
was
obliged
to
desist
for
the
present
season
and
withdrew
his
army
to
cranganor
with
a
determination
to
renew
the
war
in
the
ensuing
spring
leaving
a
strong
detachment
in
the
island
of
cochin
which
he
ordered
to
throw
up
entrenchments
for
their
defence
after
his
shameful
desertion
of
cochin
vincente
sodre
went
with
his
fleet
towards
the
kingdom
of
cambaya
meaning
to
capture
the
rich
ships
of
the
moors
which
trade
to
india
from
the
red
sea
he
there
took
five
ships
in
which
in
ready
money
only
was
found
to
the
value
of
most
of
the
moors
were
slain
in
the
battle
and
the
ships
burnt
from
cambaya
he
sailed
for
cape
guardafu
and
as
his
ships
were
foul
he
proposed
to
lay
them
aground
to
be
careened
at
the
islands
of
sodre
arrived
there
with
his
squadron
on
the
april
and
though
these
islands
were
well
inhabited
by
moors
he
resolved
to
venture
on
land
considering
that
these
islanders
were
by
no
means
warlike
and
stood
in
fear
of
our
men
the
islanders
accordingly
behaved
in
a
peaceable
manner
and
sold
our
people
such
provisions
as
they
had
to
spare
sodre
laid
one
of
his
caravels
aground
for
repair
on
which
he
was
informed
by
the
moors
that
their
coast
was
subject
to
violent
storms
in
the
month
of
may
during
which
no
ships
were
able
to
keep
the
sea
but
were
unavoidably
driven
on
shore
and
wrecked
wherefore
they
advised
him
strenuously
to
remove
to
the
other
side
of
the
island
which
would
then
be
a
sure
defence
against
the
storm
after
which
had
blown
over
he
might
return
to
their
part
of
the
coast
sodre
made
light
of
their
advice
conceiving
they
meant
him
some
harm
and
told
them
that
the
ships
of
the
moors
having
only
wooden
anchors
might
be
easily
driven
ashore
whereas
his
anchors
were
of
iron
and
would
hold
fast
pedro
raphael
hernan
rodriguez
badarsas
and
diego
perez
were
convinced
of
the
council
of
the
moors
being
good
and
therefore
quitted
these
islands
on
the
last
day
of
april
but
sodre
would
not
listen
to
their
advice
and
remained
with
his
brother
at
curia
muria
according
to
the
prediction
of
the
moors
a
violent
storm
came
on
early
in
may
by
which
the
two
remaining
ships
were
driven
from
their
anchors
and
dashed
to
pieces
vincente
sodre
and
his
brother
with
many
others
lost
their
lives
and
nothing
whatever
was
saved
out
of
these
two
ships
the
loss
of
these
two
brothers
was
considered
as
a
punishment
of
providence
for
basely
abandoning
the
rajah
of
cochin
and
the
factory
in
their
imminent
danger
those
who
were
saved
returned
towards
cochin
to
succour
our
people
and
chose
pedro
de
tayde
as
their
general
in
their
passage

few
days
after
their
arrival
a
ship
came
there
from
portugal
commanded
by
antonio
del

had
left
lisbon
alone
some
time
after
vasco
de
gama
and
had
been

delayed
on
his
voyage
in
consequence
of
the
death
of
his
pilot

had
encountered
severe
weather
on

and
was
forced
after
much
trouble
and
danger
to
take

in
being
the
fifth

expeditions
to
the
east
is
the
year
supposing
that
the
admiral
don
vasco
de
gama
had
quietly
settled
factories
in
cochin
and
cananor
the
king
of
portugal
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
send
any
great
fleet
to
india
he
therefore
determined
to
send
only
six
ships
in
two
separate
squadrons
under
separate
generals
alonso
de
albuquerque
who
was
afterwards
general
or
viceroy
of

commanded
one
of
these
squadrons

under
him
as
captains
duarte
pacheco
and
hernan
martinez
mascarennas
who
is
said
to
have
died
during

voyage
the
other
squadron
likewise
of
three
ships
was
under
the
command
of
francisco
de
albuquerque
cousin
to
alonso
having
as
captains
nicholas
coello
and
pedro
vas
de
la
vega
the
former
of
whom
sailed
under
de
gama
in
the
first
discovery
of
india
this
latter
squadron
sailed
from
lisbon
fifteen
days
after
the
other
yet
arrived
first
in
india
both
squadrons
encountered
severe
storms
during
the
voyage
in
which
the
ship
commanded
by
de
la
vega
was
lost
francisco
de
albuquerque
and
nicholas
coello
arrived
at
anchediva
in
the
month
of
august
where
they
found
de
tayde
and
the
other
captains
who
had
wintered
there
as
related
in
the
former
section
they
here
received
notice
of
the
war
between
the
zamorin
and
the
rajah
of
cochin
and
of
the
sinister
events
which
had
occurred
at
that
place
for
which
reason
francisco
stood
over
with
the
whole
fleet
now
consisting
of
six
sail
to
cananor
where
he
expected
to
receive
more
exact
intelligence
of
the
state
of
affairs
in
cochin
they
were
here
received
with
great
joy
by
the
portuguese
factory
and
even
the
rajah
of
cananor
came
on
board
the
generals
ship
in
person
and
gave
him
a
distinct
recital
of
what
had
happened
at
cochin
and
of
the
present
situation
of
triumpara
alonso
de
albuquerque
lost
no
time
in
going
to
cochin
where
he
arrived
on
the
night
of
saturday
the
of
september
immediately
on
his
approach
the
troops
of
calicut
who
guarded
the
entrenchments
thrown
up
by
the
zamorin
abandoned
their
posts
in
the
island
of
cochin
and
fled
to
cranganor
according
to
orders
to
that
effect
from
the
zamorin
who
had
received
notice
of
the
arrival
of
our
fleet
at
cananor
on
sunday
morning
francisco
came
to
anchor
close
to
cochin
when
he
was
joyfully
received
by
the
inhabitants
playing
on
various
instruments
of
music
and
was
soon
afterwards
visited
by
the
portuguese
factor
who
brought
him
a
message
from
the
rajah
on
the
monday
morning
leaving
his
ships
in
good
order
francisco
took
several
boats
well
armed
and
went
to
the
island
of
vaipi
to
visit
the
rajah
ordering
two
caravels
to
follow
for
security
in
case
of
any
of
the
calicut
paraws
making
their
appearance
the
rajah
received
our
general
with
infinite
satisfaction
greeting
them
with
the
exclamation
portugal
portugal
as
soon
as
our
boats
were
within
hail
which
was
answered
by
our
people
shouting
out
cochin
cochin
and
down
with
the
zamorin
on
landing
the
rajah
embraced
francisco
de
albuquerque
with
tears
in
his
eyes
saying
he
only
desired
to
live
till
restored
to
his
dominions
that
his
subjects
might
be
satisfied
of
his
just
conduct
in
suffering
so
much
for
the
service
of
the
king
of
portugal
in
the
name
of
that
sovereign
francisco
gave
hearty
thanks
to
triumpara
for
his
fidelity
and
promised
him
ample
revenge
on
his
enemies
and
as
his
finances
were
much
reduced
he
made
him
a
present
of
crowns
from
the
chest
belonging
to
the
expedition
to
serve
his
present
necessities
until
he
might
be
again
able
to
draw
the
rents
of
his
own
dominions
this
gift
was
exceedingly
acceptable
to
the
rajah
whose
affairs
were
then
at
a
very
low
ebb
and
gave
much
satisfaction
to
the
natives
who
were
by
it
greatly
reconciled
to
the
protection
which
their
rajah
had
given
to
our
men
the
rajah
was
immediately
brought
back
in
triumph
to
cochin
amid
the
joyful
acclamations
of
his
subjects
who
henceforwards
treated
our
men
with
esteem
and
respect
the
news
of
the
rajahs
return
to
cochin
and
of
the
money
which
had
been
given
him
by
our
general
was
speedily
communicated
to
the
zamorin
who
in
expectation
of
the
renewal
of
the
war
sent
orders
to
his
caymals
or
governors
on
the
frontiers
towards
cochin
to
make
every
preparation
for
defence
on
the
very
day
on
which
the
rajah
returned
to
cochin
francisco
de
albuquerque
resolved
to
commence
hostilities
by
an
attack
on
the
island
directly
over
against
cochin
where
he
found
the
inhabitants
quite
unprepared
and
off
their
guard
as
they
had
no
idea
of
being
so
soon
attacked
in
this
unprepared
state
a
great
number
of
the
calicut
troops
were
slain
and
several
of
the
towns
on
the
island
destroyed
after
which
the
portuguese
returned
to
their
ships
without
loss
next
day
francisco
made
a
fresh
assault
on
the
same
island
with
six
hundred
men
and
was
opposed
by
the
caymal
or
governor
for
the
zamorin
with
a
force
of
two
thousand
nayres
part
of
whom
were
spearmen
but
the
greater
number
armed
with
bows
and
arrows
and
some
with
swords
and
targets
after
some
resistance
but
in
which
none
of
them
were
hurt
our
people
made
good
their
landing
and
galled
the
indians
so
sore
with
their
that
they
soon
fled
the
portuguese
pursued
quite
across
the
island
and
forced
their
enemies
to
continue
their
flight
across
the
water
leaving
many
of
their
men
behind
both
killed
and
wounded
having
now
no
enemy
to
oppose
them
in
the
island
the
portuguese
laid
it
entirely
waste
and
burnt
all
the
towns
and
villages
it
contained
adjoining
to
this
island
there
lay
another
named
which
belonged
to
a
caymal
who
was
subject
to
the
rajah
of
cochin
but
had
revolted
to
the
zamorin
at
the
commencement
of
the
war
from
some
spies
employed
by
the
rajah
of
cochin
it
was
understood
that
this
caymal
had
a
force
of
three
thousand
nayres
seven
hundred
of
whom
were
archers
and
forty
were
armed
with
matchlocks
besides
which
all
their
towns
were
well
fortified
with
trenches
he
had
likewise
several
paraws
provided
with
ordnance
with
which
he
was
supplied
by
the
zamorin
and
these
were
stationed
in
one
of
the
harbours
of
the
island
to
defend
it
against
the
portuguese
notwithstanding
all
these
preparations
of
which
he
was
well
informed
francisco
albuquerque
went
against
this
island
the
day
after
he
had
reduced
the
former
and
commenced
his
attack
against
the
harbour
in
which
the
paraws
were
stationed
the
enemy
were
soon
driven
by
our
ordnance
from
their
boats
yet
many
of
them
continued
in
the
water
up
to
their
girdles
to
resist
the
landing
of
our
troops
annoying
them
as
much
as
possible
with
stones
spears
and
arrows
they
were
at
length
driven
from
the
water
by
our
ordnance
but
rallied
again
on
the
shore
and
bravely
resisted
our
people
in
landing
for
a
long
time
they
were
at
length
driven
to
take
shelter
in
a
grove
of
palm
trees
in
which
they
defended
themselves
for
a
short
space
and
were
at
the
last
driven
to
seek
for
safety
in
a
disorderly
flight
in
which
they
were
pursued
by
our
men
in
the
pursuit
pedro
de
lares
who
was
constable
to
francisco
de
albuquerque
being
separated
from
the
rest
was
attacked
by
three
nayres
all
at
once
one
of
these
let
fly
an
arrow
which
hit
pedro
on
his
plate
but
without
hurting
him
on
which
pedro
levelled
his
piece
and
shot
him
dead
the
second
nayre
he
likewise
slew
by
another
shot
the
third
nayre
wounded
him
in
the
leg
with
a
weapon
called
a
and
then
endeavoured
to
run
away
but
pedro
killed
him
with
his
sword
on
the
enemy
being
put
to
flight
francisco
divided
his
forces
into
three
bodies
two
of
them
portuguese
and
the
third
composed
of
nayres
in
the
service
of
the
rajah
of
cochin
and
marched
all
over
the
island
plundering
and
burning
the
towns
and
villages
without
resistance
while
thus
employed
a
considerable
number
of
paraws
arrived
with
reinforcements
from
calicut
from
which
a
powerful
body
of
nayres
landed
in
that
part
of
the
island
where
duarte
pacheco
happened
to
be
posted
with
a
very
inferior
force
and
had
assuredly
destroyed
him
and
his
men
but
that
francisco
de
albuquerque
came
very
opportunely
to
his
aid
finding
greater
resistance
than
he
expected
and
fearing
lest
the
caymal
might
attack
him
in
the
rear
while
engaged
in
front
with
the
nayres
of
calicut
francisco
detached
a
part
of
his
troops
under
nicholas
coello
assisted
by
antonio
del
campo
and
pedro
de
tayde
to
assault
the
residence
of
the
caymal
who
was
slain
bravely
fighting
in
its
defence
at
this
place
one
of
our
men
was
slain
and
eighteen
wounded
in
the
mean
time
francisco
de
albuquerque
and
duarte
pacheco
defeated
the
reinforcements
from
calicut
and
forced
them
to
take
refuge
on
board
their
paraws
leaving
many
of
their
men
slain
and
wounded
on
the
shore
after
this
signal
victory
by
which
the
greater
part
of
the
three
thousand
nayres
belonging
to
the
caymal
and
many
of
those
from
calicut
were
slain
francisco
de
albuquerque
conferred
the
honour
of
knighthood
on
several
of
his
officers
who
had
signalized
themselves
on
the
occasion
he
then
wasted
the
whole
island
with
fire
and
sword
francisco
determined
in
the
next
place
to
attack
the
country
of
the
lord
of
repelim
for
which
purpose
he
departed
with
his
troops
by
water
from
cochin
and
reached
a
town
in
that
territory
four
leagues
from
cochin
about
eight
next
morning
near
two
thousand
nayres
five
hundred
of
whom
were
armed
with
bows
and
arrows
were
stationed
on
the
beach
of
the
isle
of
repelim
to
repel
this
attack
but
were
soon
forced
by
our
ordnance
to
retire
into
a
grove
of
palms
on
which
francisco
landed
with
his
troops
the
van
being
led
by
nicholas
coello
the
enemy
resisted
for
some
time
under
the
shelter
of
the
trees
and
wounded
some
of
our
people
but
were
at
length
forced
to
take
to
flight
after
losing
a
good
many
of
their
men
who
were
shot
by
our
and
our
troops
followed
the
nayres
who
took
refuge
in
the
towns
of
the
island
in
which
much
greater
slaughter
was
made
of
the
enemy
than
in
the
field
as
they
were
crowded
together
and
more
exposed
to
our
shot
on
taking
possession
of
the
town
francisco
gave
it
up
to
be
plundered
by
the
nayres
of
cochin
who
assisted
him
on
this
expedition
that
they
might
not
consider
the
conduct
of
the
portuguese
on
this
occasion
proceeded
from
any
inclination
for
plundering
the
country
but
from
a
desire
to
revenge
the
injuries
which
had
been
done
to
their
own
rajah
on
his
return
from
this
victory
francisco
was
joyfully
received
by
the
rajah
of
cochin
who
desired
him
to
desist
from
any
farther
operations
against
the
enemy
as
he
considered
himself
sufficiently
revenged
but
francisco
requested
his
permission
to
continue
the
war
as
he
was
still
unsatisfied
till
he
had
taken
effectual
vengeance
on
the
zamorin
and
accounted
it
no
trouble
to
fight
in
the
service
of
the
rajah
he
seized
however
the
present
opportunity
of
the
high
favour
in
which
he
stood
with
the
rajah
to
solicit
permission
for
constructing
a
fort
at
cochin
for
the
protection
of
the
portuguese
factory
during
the
absence
of
the
ships
this
request
was
immediately
complied
with
the
rajah
even
offered
to
be
at
the
sole
charge
and
francisco
lost
no
time
in
proceeding
to
construct
the
intended
fort
as
there
were
neither
stones
lime
nor
sand
to
be
procured
it
was
necessary
to
build
the
castle
of
timber
which
the
rajah
ordered
to
be
immediately
provided
for
the
purpose
and
brought
to
the
spot
appointed
which
was
close
to
the
river
side
as
best
adapted
for
resisting
the
assault
of
the
calicut
fleet
in
any
future
attempt
against
cochin
the
rajah
sent
likewise
a
great
number
of
his
subjects
to
carry
on
the
work
saying
that
our
people
had
already
had
enough
to
do
in
the
operations
of
the
war
but
francisco
commanded
our
people
to
work
in
constructing
the
fortifications
the
foundations
of
which
were
laid
on
the
september
the
inhabitants
of
cochin
were
astonished
at
the
diligence
with
which
our
people
laboured
at
this
work
saying
there
were
no
such
men
in
the
world
as
they
were
equally
good
at
all
things
on
the
september
four
days
after
the
commencement
of
the
fort
alonso
de
albuquerque
arrived
with
his
ships
at
cochin
having
been
delayed
on
his
voyage
by
severe
storms
and
contrary
winds
yet
brought
all
his
men
with
him
in
excellent
health
francisco
was
much
pleased
at
his
arrival
and
a
portion
of
the
fort
being
allotted
to
those
newly
arrived
it
was
soon
finished
though
built
of
timber
this
castle
was
as
strong
and
handsome
as
if
it
had
been
constructed
of
stone
and
lime
it
was
of
a
square
form
each
face
being
eighteen
yards
with
bulwarks
or
bastions
at
each
corner
mounted
with
ordnance
the
walls
were
made
of
two
rows
of
palm
trees
and
other
strong
timber
firmly
set
in
the
ground
and
bound
together
with
iron
hoops
and
large
nails
the
space
between
the
two
rows
of
timber
being
rammed
full
of
earth
and
sand
and
the
whole
surrounded
by
a
ditch
always
full
of
water
the
day
after
this
fort
was
finished
which
was
named
manuel
in
honour
of
the
king
of
portugal
the
general
with
all
his
people
made
a
solemn
procession
in
which
the
vicar
of
the
fort
bore
the
crucifix
under
a
canopy
carried
by
the
captains
of
the
fleet
preceded
by
trumpets
and
other
instruments
of
music
the
fort
was
solemnly
blessed
and
consecrated
by
the
celebration
of
mass
after
which
friar
gaston
preached
a
sermon
in
which
he
exhorted
his
hearers
to
be
thankful
to
god
who
had
permitted
the
inhabitants
of
the
small
western
kingdom
of
portugal
to
construct
a
fortress
in
this
distant
region
among
so
many
enemies
of
the
catholic
faith
he
expressed
a
hope
that
this
might
be
the
forerunner
of
many
other
establishments
of
a
similar
nature
to
the
advancement
of
the
true
religion
among
the
heathen
and
the
glory
of
portugal
he
likewise
desired
his
hearers
to
keep
always
in
mind
the
high
obligations
they
owed
to
the
rajah
for
the
good
service
he
had
rendered
to
the
king
of
portugal
on
this
occasion
a
faithful
report
was
carried
to
the
rajah
of
this
part
of
the
discourse
who
was
much
gratified
and
gave
thanks
for
the
same
to
the
two
generals
after
completing
the
fort
the
portuguese
renewed
the
war
and
made
an
attack
on
two
towns
belonging
to
the
lord
of
repelim
on
the
coast
about
five
leagues
from
cochin
having
learned
from
spies
that
they
were
but
slightly
garrisoned
on
this
expedition
the
generals
took
a
body
of
seven
hundred
men
and
departing
from
cochin
about
two
hours
before
day
they
arrived
at
their
destination
about
nine
next
morning
these
towns
had
a
population
of
six
thousand
people
besides
children
and
were
only
defended
by
three
hundred
nayres
all
bowmen
alonso
de
albuquerque
with
part
of
the
forces
landed
at
the
nearest
town
and
francisco
with
the
remainder
of
the
forces
at
the
other
which
was
only
about
a
distant
from
the
former
in
the
first
town
the
enemy
was
completely
surprised
and
run
away
and
the
place
was
set
on
fire
without
resistance
on
seeing
the
people
run
away
our
men
pursued
and
slew
many
of
the
fugitives
and
when
wearied
of
the
pursuit
they
plundered
and
destroyed
the
country
in
the
mean
time
the
alarm
was
spread
over
the
neighbourhood
and
about
nayres
assembled
who
made
an
attack
upon
our
men
as
they
were
embarking
so
that
they
were
in
great
danger
in
particular
duarte
pacheco
not
being
able
to
find
his
boat
in
the
place
where
he
had
left
it
was
closely
pursued
and
though
he
and
his
company
defended
themselves
valiantly
and
killed
many
of
the
enemy
eight
of
his
men
were
wounded
with
arrows
so
superior
was
the
number
of
the
enemy
on
this
occasion
that
pacheco
and
his
men
had
assuredly
been
all
slain
if
the
rest
of
the
troops
had
not
again
landed
to
his
rescue
on
which
the
enemy
lost
heart
and
run
away
leaving
the
field
of
battle
strewed
over
with
their
slain
after
the
defeat
of
the
nayres
our
men
set
fire
to
fifteen
paraws
which
were
drawn
up
on
the
beach
and
carried
away
seven
which
were
afloat
the
lord
of
repelim
was
much
grieved
at
the
destruction
of
his
towns
and
being
afraid
of
our
people
making
an
attack
on
another
about
a
league
farther
up
the
river
he
sent
a
strong
detachment
of
his
nayres
for
its
security
the
generals
however
resolved
to
follow
up
their
victory
and
to
do
all
the
evil
in
their
power
to
the
territories
of
this
lord
for
this
purpose
after
allowing
their
men
some
time
for
rest
they
departed
about
midnight
while
it
was
still
so
dark
that
they
could
not
see
each
other
in
the
boats
expecting
to
come
upon
their
enemies
by
surprise
by
dawn
of
next
morning
the
boats
in
which
alonso
de
albuquerque
and
his
party
were
embarked
got
considerably
of
the
rest
and
arrived
at
the
town
which
it
was
intended
to
attack
a
good
while
before
day
weary
of
waiting
for
the
rest
he
landed
his
men
and
gave
orders
to
set
the
town
on
fire
at
first
they
were
successful
in
this
rash
enterprise
as
the
ordinary
inhabitants
were
a
cowardly
unarmed
people
but
the
garrison
of
above
two
thousand
nayres
having
assembled
on
the
alarm
attacked
alonso
and
his
men
with
great
fury
and
forced
them
to
retreat
to
their
boats
after
killing
one
man
and
wounding
several
others
of
the
party
which
only
consisted
originally
of
forty
men
alonso
and
his
soldiers
would
not
have
been
able
to
make
good
their
retreat
if
the
sailors
who
remained
in
charge
of
the
boats
had
not
fired
off
a
falcon
or
small
piece
of
ordnance
on
which
the
nayres
gave
over
the
pursuit
by
this
time
day
broke
and
francisco
de
albuquerque
approached
with
the
rest
of
the
boats
and
seeing
the
perilous
situation
of
alonso
he
commanded
the
ordnance
in
the
boats
to
be
played
off
against
the
enemy
on
which
they
fled
from
the
shore
at
this
time
pacheco
who
was
somewhat
astern
of
the
rest
observed
a
great
number
of
armed
nayres
marching
along
a
narrow
passage
to
reinforce
the
others
at
the
town
and
brought
his
boat
so
near
the
pass
that
he
completely
stopt
their
passage
that
way
the
whole
of
our
men
were
now
landed
and
soon
constrained
the
enemy
to
take
flight
with
considerable
loss
after
which
they
set
the
town
on
fire
but
did
not
think
it
prudent
to
pursue
the
runaways
as
they
were
not
acquainted
with
the
country
after
this
exploit
duarte
pacheco
and
pedro
de
tayde
went
with
their
divisions
to
destroy
another
town
at
some
distance
in
their
way
towards
which
they
fought
and
defeated
eighteen
paraws
belonging
to
the
zamorin
and
then
set
the
town
on
fire
from
thence
they
stood
over
to
the
island
of
the
caymal
of
which
was
an
enemy
of
the
cochin
rajah
where
they
destroyed
a
large
town
from
that
place
pacheco
went
with
five
armed
paraws
of
cochin
to
burn
another
town
where
he
met
with
considerable
resistance
and
slew
a
great
number
of
the
enemy
seven
of
his
own
people
being
wounded
after
setting
the
town
on
fire
he
retired
towards
cochin
and
was
forced
to
fight
with
thirteen
armed
paraws
of
calicut
which
he
defeated
with
the
assistance
of
pedro
de
tayde
and
antonio
del
campo
who
fortunately
joined
him
in
this
emergency
on
their
defeat
the
calient
paraws
retired
into
a
creek
where
one
of
them
ran
aground
and
was
taken
by
pacheco
but
our
men
being
worn
out
with
hard
rowing
were
unable
to
pursue
the
rest
and
returned
to
cochin
on
receiving
an
account
of
these
transactions
the
rajah
was
much
satisfied
with
the
revenge
which
had
been
taken
of
his
enemies
and
requested
of
our
generals
to
discontinue
the
war
to
which
however
they
were
by
no
means
inclined
on
account
of
the
war
no
pepper
was
brought
from
the
country
to
sell
at
the
factory
in
cochin
neither
dared
the
merchants
to
go
out
in
search
of
that
commodity
insomuch
that
the
factory
had
only
been
able
to
procure
and
the
factor
requested
the
generals
to
go
in
quest
of
some
which
was
to
be
procured
at
a
place
about
nine
leagues
from
cochin
for
this
purpose
the
two
generals
and
all
their
captains
set
out
from
cochin
under
night
that
their
intentions
might
not
be
discovered
by
the
enemy
on
the
way
pacheco
destroyed
a
whole
island
in
which
he
fought
against
six
thousand
of
the
enemy
with
his
own
company
only
and
the
two
generals
put
paraws
to
flight
after
this
pacheco
and
del
campo
destroyed
a
town
on
the
continent
where
they
defeated
two
thousand
nayres
many
of
whom
were
slain
without
any
loss
on
their
side
after
this
the
generals
sent
on
the
for
the
pepper
which
carried
such
merchandize
as
was
meant
to
be
given
in
exchange
and
for
its
protection
pacheco
and
three
other
captains
accompanied
it
with
two
hundred
men
and
five
hundred
cochin
paraws
in
passing
a
narrow
strait
or
river
our
people
were
assailed
from
the
banks
by
a
vast
number
of
the
natives
armed
with
bows
and
arrows
but
were
defended
by
their
targets
which
were
fixed
on
the
gunwales
of
their
boats
leaving
one
of
his
captains
with
fifty
portuguese
t
protect
the
tony
pacheco
with
the
other
two
captains
and
the
troops
belonging
to
the
rajah
made
towards
the
shore
firing
off
his
falcons
against
the
enemy
whom
he
forced
to
quit
the
shore
with
much
loss
after
which
he
landed
with
his
troops
most
of
whom
were
armed
with
the
enemy
who
were
full
two
thousand
strong
resisted
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
but
at
length
took
to
flight
after
having
many
slain
pacheco
pursued
them
to
a
village
where
the
fugitives
rallied
and
were
joined
by
many
nayres
insomuch
that
they
now
amounted
to
six
thousand
men
and
our
people
were
in
great
jeopardy
as
the
enemy
endeavoured
to
surround
them
and
to
intercept
their
return
to
the
boats
but
our
men
defended
themselves
manfully
and
fought
their
way
back
to
the
shore
where
the
natives
divided
on
each
hand
being
afraid
of
the
shot
of
the
falcons
which
slew
great
numbers
of
them
and
our
men
without
having
a
single
man
killed
or
wounded
the
zamorin
was
much
displeased
at
the
successes
of
our
people
against
his
confederates
and
by
the
loss
of
many
of
his
paraws
in
these
several
actions
and
was
even
afraid
lest
the
portuguese
might
eventually
dispossess
him
of
his
dominions
he
used
every
exertion
therefore
to
prevent
us
from
procuring
pepper
being
in
hopes
if
our
ships
were
constrained
to
return
to
portugal
without
loading
that
they
would
come
no
more
back
to
india
he
used
his
influence
therefore
even
with
the
merchants
of
cochin
to
refuse
supplying
pepper
to
our
ships
which
they
did
so
effectually
under
pretence
of
the
war
that
in
spite
of
the
influence
of
the
rajah
and
notwithstanding
high
offers
of
reward
from
francisco
de
albuquerque
the
factory
had
only
been
able
to
procure
quintals
or
bahars
of
pepper
and
even
that
was
got
with
hard
fighting
some
hurt
to
our
own
men
and
infinite
loss
of
lives
to
the
enemy
unable
to
procure
any
more
pepper
in
cochin
alonso
de
albuquerque
went
to
coulan
in
search
of
that
commodity
accompanied
by
pedro
de
tayde
and
antonio
del
campo
knowing
that
the
government
of
that
state
was
desirous
of
having
one
of
our
factories
established
in
their
city
and
had
solicited
both
pedro
alvares
cabral
and
the
lord
admiral
de
gama
to
that
effect
and
alonso
was
determined
to
go
to
war
with
the
people
of
coulan
unless
they
gave
him
loading
for
his
ships
coulan
is
twelve
leagues
from
cochin
and
from
cape
comorin
before
the
building
of
calicut
coulan
was
the
principal
city
of
malabar
and
the
port
of
greatest
trade
on
that
coast
its
buildings
more
especially
the
temples
and
shrines
of
their
idols
are
larger
and
more
splendid
than
those
of
cochin
the
haven
is
excellent
the
country
is
well
stored
with
provisions
and
the
condition
of
the
people
resembles
in
all
things
what
has
been
formerly
said
of
the
inhabitants
of
calicut
the
inhabitants
are
idolatrous
malabars
having
among
them
many
rich
moorish
merchants
more
especially
since
the
war
broke
out
between
us
and
the
zamorin
as
many
of
these
merchants
had
left
calicut
to
reside
at
coulan
they
trade
with
coromandel
ceylon
the
maldive
islands
bengal
pegu
camatia
and
malava
the
rajah
or
king
of
this
state
rules
over
an
extensive
kingdom
in
which
there
are
many
rich
cities
and
several
good
harbours
by
which
means
he
has
a
large
revenue
and
is
able
to
maintain
a
great
military
force
but
the
men
are
mostly
of
a
low
stature
he
entertains
in
his
palace
a
guard
of
three
hundred
women
armed
with
bows
and
arrows
who
are
very
expert
archers
and
they
bind
up
their
breasts
very
tight
with
bandages
of
silk
and
linen
that
they
may
not
stand
in
the
way
of
using
their
bows
this
rajah
usually
resides
in
a
city
named
calle
and
is
generally
at
war
with
the
king
of
narsinga
in
the
city
of
coulan
which
is
governed
by
certain
officers
or
aldermen
there
is
a
church
which
was
built
by
the
apostle
st
thomas
who
came
here
to
preach
the
catholic
faith
and
made
many
converts
both
among
the
idolaters
and
others
who
have
handed
down
the
christian
belief
from
generation
to
generation
so
that
there
are
at
least
twelve
thousand
families
of
christians
scattered
abroad
in
the
country
in
which
they
have
churches
in
many
places
the
king
who
then
ruled
in
coulan
being
much
displeased
at
the
numbers
of
his
subjects
who
were
converted
to
christianity
banished
st
thomas
from
his
dominions
who
then
went
to
a
city
called
malapur
or
meliapour
on
the
coast
of
the
dominions
of
narsinga
and
was
followed
by
the
christians
of
coulan
and
even
by
many
of
the
idolaters
he
is
said
to
have
retired
into
a
solitude
in
the
mountains
where
he
died
and
whence
his
body
was
removed
for
interment
in
a
vault
of
the
church
he
had
built
at
coulan
this
church
is
now
deserted
and
entirely
overgrown
with
trees
and
bushes
and
is
kept
by
a
poor
moorish
zealot
who
subsists
on
alms
which
he
receives
from
christian
pilgrims
and
even
some
of
the
idolaters
give
alms
at
this
tomb
on
the
arrival
of
alonso
de
albuquerque
at
the
harbour
of
coulan
the
governors
of
the
city
came
on
board
to
visit
him
and
settled
a
treaty
with
him
in
which
it
was
stipulated
that
we
were
to
have
a
factory
in
the
city
and
that
they
should
provide
a
loading
with
all
possible
dispatch
for
the
three
ship
he
had
along
with
him
while
one
of
his
ships
was
taking
in
a
lading
in
the
harbour
the
other
two
always
kept
out
at
sea
watching
all
ships
that
passed
and
obliging
every
one
they
could
descry
to
come
and
give
an
account
of
themselves
to
albuquerque
as
general
under
the
king
of
portugal
he
offered
no
injury
to
any
of
these
unless
to
such
as
belonged
to
the
moors
of
the
red
sea
all
of
which
that
fell
in
his
way
were
first
plundered
and
then
burnt
in
revenge
for
the
injuries
they
had
done
to
the
portuguese
when
the
house
for
the
factory
was
finished
and
the
ships
laden
alonso
left
there
antonio
de
sola
as
factor
with
two
clerks
rodrigo
aranso
and
lopo
rabelo
an
interpreter
named
medera
and
two
friars
to
serve
as
chaplains
together
with
other
assistants
being
twenty
in
all
after
which
he
returned
to
cochin
about
this
time
francisco
de
albuquerque
received
a
message
from
a
friendly
moor
of
calicut
who
has
been
formerly
mentioned
giving
him
notice
that
the
zamorin
was
determined
to
make
another
attack
on
cochin
so
soon
as
the
portuguese
fleet
had
departed
for
europe
and
to
fortify
it
in
such
a
manner
as
should
prevent
them
from
having
any
farther
intercourse
with
that
country
with
this
view
the
zamorin
had
entered
into
treaties
with
all
the
rajahs
and
leading
nayres
or
nobles
of
malabar
and
it
was
even
rumoured
that
those
of
cananor
and
coulan
had
secretly
entered
into
terms
with
him
against
the
portuguese
and
the
rajah
of
cochin
he
said
farther
that
the
moorish
merchants
had
promised
large
assistance
for
carrying
on
the
war
as
they
were
exceedingly
desirous
to
exclude
the
christians
from
trading
to
india
about
the
same
time
a
letter
came
from
rodrigo
reynel
to
the
same
effect
saying
that
the
zamorin
was
levying
troops
and
had
caused
a
great
number
of
cannon
to
be
prepared
for
the
war
reynel
likewise
said
that
the
moors
of
cochin
were
decidedly
in
the
interest
of
the
zamorin
and
were
therefore
to
be
looked
to
with
much
jealousy
the
rajah
likewise
informed
albuquerque
that
from
certain
bramins
who
had
come
from
calicut
he
was
informed
of
the
intentions
and
preparations
of
the
zamorin
for
reducing
cochin
and
as
he
had
little
reliance
on
his
own
subjects
he
requested
some
portuguese
troops
might
be
left
for
his
defence
francisco
gave
the
rajah
assurance
of
protection
and
even
that
the
portuguese
would
add
to
his
dominions
at
a
future
period
in
reward
for
his
fidelity
and
friendship
to
their
nation
and
as
a
compensation
for
the
injuries
he
had
suffered
in
their
cause
the
rajah
was
much
pleased
with
this
assurance
and
as
francisco
found
he
could
have
no
more
pepper
at
cochin
he
determined
upon
returning
to
portugal
when
he
had
appointed
a
fit
person
to
remain
as
in
india
he
found
this
matter
difficult
as
none
of
his
captains
were
willing
to
remain
with
the
small
force
which
he
was
able
to
leave
behind
at
length
duarte
pacheco
willingly
accepted
the
charge
and
the
rajah
was
much
pleased
with
his
appointment
having
already
sufficient
proof
of
his
valour
pacheco
was
accordingly
left
at
cochin
with
his
own
ship
and
two
caravels
commanded
by
pedro
raphael
and
diego
perez
and
a
pinnace
with
ninety
men
in
health
besides
others
who
were
sick
as
much
ordnance
and
ammunition
was
likewise
given
him
as
could
possibly
be
spared
from
the
homeward
bound
ships
all
these
things
being
settled
francisco
de
albuquerque
sailed
for
cananor
where
he
proposed
to
endeavour
to
procure
the
liberty
of
rodrigo
reynel
and
the
others
who
were
at
calicut
but
the
zamorin
sent
him
word
that
there
was
no
necessity
to
take
this
person
away
who
was
desirous
of
remaining
in
india
and
if
the
would
remain
he
should
have
the
pepper
which
was
promised
at
this
time
alonso
de
albuquerque
returned
from
coulan
and
joined
francisco
at
cananor
and
a
letter
was
brought
from
rodrigo
reynel
giving
information
that
the
zamorin
was
certainly
resolved
to
attempt
the
conquest
of
cochin
as
soon
as
the
portuguese
ships
should
leave
the
coast
and
that
his
only
intention
in
making
an
offer
of
pepper
was
with
a
view
to
prevent
them
from
burning
the
ships
which
were
then
in
the
harbour
of
calicut
all
matters
being
arranged
the
portuguese
fleet
sailed
from
cananor
on
the
of
january
alonso
de
albuquerque
and
antonio
del
campo
came
to
lisbon
on
the
of
august
and
presented
to
the
king
weight
of
seed
pearls
which
are
called
or
pound
weight
of
great
pearls
and
eight
of
the
oysters
from
which
the
pearls
are
procured
he
gave
likewise
to
the
king
a
diamond
as
big
as
a
large
bean
and
many
other
jewels
and
two
persian
horses
of
wonderful
swiftness
francisco
de
albuquerque
and
nicholas
coello
who
left
cananor
some
time
after
alonso
were
cast
away
on
the
voyage
and
never
more
heard
of
pedro
de
tayde
was
driven
to
quiloa
where
his
ship
was
lost
on
the
bar
and
most
of
his
men
drowned
from
quiloa
he
went
to
mozambique
in
a
where
he
afterwards
died
but
left
a
letter
in
which
he
gave
a
particular
account
of
the
state
of
affairs
in
india
which
he
ordered
to
be
delivered
to
the
first
captain
who
might
put
in
there
from
portugal
antonio
de
saldanna
the
last
of
the

were
sent
to

came
to
anchor
at
a
place
called
st
thomas
on
the
east
side
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
which
was
made
famous
by
the
name
of
del
or
saldannas
on
account
of
his
having
lost
several
of
his
men
there
in
endeavouring
to
land
at
this
time
ruy
lorenzo
was
parted
from
him
in
a
storm
which
drove
him
to
mozambique
whence
he
held
on
his
course
for
quiloa
where
he
took
some
small
prizes
being
ambitious
to
distinguish
himself
he
went
to
the
island
of
zanzibar
twenty
leagues
short
of
mombasa
where
he
took
twenty
small
vessels
after
this
he
appeared
before
the
town
of
mombasa
the
king
of
which
place
sent
out
a
number
of
armed
almadias
or
paraws
to
take
his
ship
but
lorenzo
armed
his
long
boat
with
a
crew
of
thirty
men
which
took
four
of
the
almadias
and
killed
a
great
many
of
the
moors
the
king
sent
an
army
of
men
to
the
shore
under
the
command
of
his
son
who
was
killed
with
some
others
at
the
first
volley
on
which
one
of
the
moors
ran
out
from
the
ranks
with
a
flag
of
the
portuguese
arms
craving
a
parley
peace
was
soon
concluded
by
which
the
king
agreed
to
pay
of
gold
yearly
as
a
tribute
to
the
king
of
portugal
from
mombasa
lorenzo
sailed
for
melinda
the
king
of
which
place
was
much
oppressed
by
him
of
mombasa
on
account
of
his
connection
with
the
portuguese
on
his
way
he
took
two
ships
and
three
small
vessels
called
in
which
were
twelve
magistrates
of
brava
who
submitted
their
city
to
the
king
of
portugal
and
engaged
to
give
meticals
of
yearly
tribute
on
his
arrival
at
melinda
he
found
that
a
battle
had
been
fought
between
the
kings
of
melinda
and
mombasa
in
which
neither
could
claim
the
victory
antonio
de
saldanna
likewise
arrived
at
melinda
about
this
time
and
by
his
mediation
peace
was
restored
between
these
princes
saldanna
and
lorenzo
went
thence
to
the
mouth
of
the
red
sea
where
they
defeated
some
moors
at
the
islands
of
beyond
cape
guardafu
on
the
upper
coast
of
arabia
they
burnt
one
ship
belonging
to
the
moors
which
was
laden
with
frankincense
and
they
drove
another
on

carried
a

duarte
pacheco
who
was
left
with
the
command
in
india
remained
there
for
some
time
to
take
in
provisions
having
along
with
him
the
caravel
commanded
by
pedro
raphael
while
the
other
ship
of
his
small
squadron
under
the
command
of
diego
perez
was
repairing
at
cochin
pacheco
anchored
with
his
own
ship
off
the
harbour
of
cananor
and
dispatched
raphael
along
the
coast
to
oblige
all
ships
which
passed
that
way
to
come
to
cananor
in
acknowledgment
of
pacheco
as
in
the
indies
several
were
brought
in
by
raphael
and
were
constrained
to
give
a
full
account
from
whence
they
came
whither
bound
and
what
they
were
laden
with
in
case
of
their
containing
any
pepper
more
especially
if
bound
for
calicut
he
used
to
take
that
commodity
from
them
and
carried
his
command
with
so
high
a
hand
that
he
became
the
terror
of
these
seas
one
night
while
thus
at
anchor
a
fleet
of
ships
came
suddenly
to
the
where
he
lay
which
he
suspected
to
have
been
sent
from
calicut
on
purpose
to
attack
him
considering
himself
in
imminent
danger
he
immediately
slipped
his
cables
not
having
time
to
weigh
anchor
and
made
sail
to
gain
the
windward
of
this
fleet
upon
which
he
directly
commenced
firing
they
were
mostly
small
ships
laden
with
rice
and
made
off
with
all
the
haste
in
their
power
though
some
of
them
ran
aground
one
of
the
vessels
of
this
fleet
was
a
large
ship
belonging
to
the
moors
of
cananor
having
nearly
men
on
board
who
resisted
for
some
time
shooting
off
their
arrows
and
even
endeavoured
to
take
our
ship
when
day
was
near
at
hand
and
after
having
nine
men
slain
in
the
action
the
moorish
captain
at
length
submitted
and
told
pacheco
that
he
belonged
to
cananor
after
some
time
spent
in
this
manner
pacheco
made
sail
for
cochin
and
in
the
passage
fell
in
with
several
ships
belonging
to
the
moors
taking
some
and
burning
or
sinking
others
on
landing
at
the
fort
of
cochin
he
learnt
from
the
factor
that
the
reports
of
the
zamorin
making
preparations
for
the
renewal
of
the
war
were
perfectly
true
and
even
that
the
moorish
inhabitants
of
cochin
were
adverse
to
the
rajah
for
having
taken
part
with
the
portuguese
against
the
zamorin
being
informed
likewise
that
the
cochin
rajah
was
in
great
fear
of
this
new
war
he
went
next
day
to
visit
him
carrying
all
his
boats
well
manned
and
fenced
with
raised
sides
of
boards
to
defend
his
men
from
the
missile
weapons
of
the
enemy
they
were
likewise
furnished
with
ordnance
and
all
decorated
with
flags
and
streamers
in
a
gallant
manner
hoping
thereby
to
inspire
confidence
in
trimumpara
who
was
much
dejected
at
the
small
force
which
had
been
left
for
his
defence
in
a
conference
between
them
the
rajah
said
to
pacheco
that
the
moors
asserted
he
was
left
in
the
indies
for
the
sole
purpose
of
removing
the
merchandize
belonging
to
the
portuguese
in
the
factory
at
cochin
to
cananor
and
coulan
and
not
to
defend
him
against
the
power
of
the
zamorin
which
he
was
even
disposed
to
think
were
true
in
consideration
of
the
smallness
of
the
fleet
under
his
command
pacheco
felt
indignant
at
the
suspicion
which
the
rajah
entertained
and
endeavoured
to
convince
him
that
he
had
been
imposed
upon
by
the
moors
out
of
enmity
to
the
portuguese
assuring
him
that
he
would
faithfully
exert
himself
in
his
defence
he
pointed
out
to
him
the
strength
of
the
natural
defences
of
cochin
which
were
all
narrow
and
defensible
therefore
by
a
few
valiant
men
against
any
number
of
assailants
the
rajah
was
greatly
relieved
by
these
assurances
and
pacheco
went
to
visit
the
different
places
by
which
the
island
of
cochin
might
be
assailed
all
of
which
he
diligently
fortified
more
especially
the
ford
which
he
strengthened
with
a
row
of
stakes
both
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
wading
across
and
to
hinder
any
of
their
vessels
from
passing
in
the
mean
time
he
was
informed
by
letter
from
rodrigo
reynel
that
a
principal
moor
in
cochin
in
concert
with
several
others
were
contriving
to
quit
that
city
and
had
been
twice
secretly
at
calicut
to
confer
with
the
zamorin
on
this
subject
pacheco
was
a
good
deal
concerned
at
this
intelligence
and
proposed
to
the
rajah
to
have
this
moor
executed
for
his
treasonable
intercourse
with
the
zamorin
but
trimumpara
would
by
no
means
consent
to
this
measure
saying
that
it
would
occasion
a
mutiny
among
the
moors
by
whom
the
city
was
furnished
with
provisions
in
exchange
for
goods
and
be
thought
it
were
better
to
dissemble
with
them
all
pacheco
then
said
that
he
would
have
a
conference
with
the
moors
meaning
to
use
policy
with
them
since
the
rajah
did
not
approve
of
violent
measures
and
to
this
the
rajah
consented
giving
orders
to
his
naires
to
obey
the
orders
of
pacheco
in
pursuance
of
this
plan
pacheco
went
to
the
dwelling
of
this
chief
moor
named
close
by
the
river
taking
with
him
a
guard
of
his
own
men
well
armed
and
requested
that
person
to
send
for
some
other
leading
men
among
the
moors
whom
he
named
saying
that
he
wished
to
consult
with
them
on
a
subject
of
great
importance
to
them
all
when
they
were
all
assembled
he
made
them
a
speech
to
the
following
effect
i
sent
for
you
honest
merchants
that
i
might
inform
you
for
what
purpose
i
remain
in
the
indies
it
is
reported
by
some
that
i
mean
only
to
remove
the
factory
and
the
goods
belonging
to
the
portuguese
to
coulan
and
cananor
but
my
sole
purpose
is
to
defend
cochin
against
the
zamorin
and
even
if
necessary
i
will
die
in
your
defence
i
am
resolved
to
meet
him
in
cambalan
by
which
way
it
is
said
he
means
to
invade
you
and
if
he
has
the
boldness
to
meet
me
i
hope
to
make
him
prisoner
and
to
carry
him
with
me
into
portugal
i
am
informed
that
you
intend
to
go
away
from
cochin
and
to
induce
the
rest
of
the
inhabitants
among
whom
you
are
the
chiefs
to
do
the
same
but
i
am
astonished
men
of
your
wisdom
should
leave
the
country
in
which
you
were
born
and
where
you
have
dwelt
so
many
years
from
fear
of
vain
reports
such
conduct
were
even
disgraceful
for
women
and
is
therefore
much
more
so
for
you
who
are
men
of
wisdom
and
experience
if
you
should
be
disposed
to
remove
from
hence
when
you
shall
actually
be
in
danger
i
should
hardly
blame
you
but
to
do
so
before
that
danger
is
apparent
and
even
before
a
single
battle
has
been
fought
must
proceed
either
from
cowardice
or
treachery
you
all
well
know
that
only
a
very
short
while
ago
a
very
small
number
of
our
portuguese
defeated
thousands
of
those
same
enemies
who
now
threaten
to
invade
us
you
may
allege
that
we
were
then
more
in
number
than
now
which
was
assuredly
the
case
but
we
then
fought
in
the
open
field
where
numbers
were
necessary
and
we
now
propose
only
to
fight
in
narrow
passes
in
which
a
small
number
will
suffice
as
well
as
a
multitude
you
already
know
that
i
can
fight
as
it
is
i
who
have
done
the
greatest
injury
to
the
enemy
in
the
late
war
which
the
rajah
can
well
vouch
as
for
me
i
shall
never
yield
and
i
have
more
to
lose
being
overcome
than
any
of
you
put
your
trust
therefore
in
me
and
my
troops
and
remain
where
you
are
till
you
see
the
event
of
our
defence
your
sovereign
remains
in
his
port
and
wherefore
should
you
go
away
i
and
the
portuguese
who
are
with
me
remain
in
this
far
distant
country
to
defend
your
king
and
you
who
are
his
natural
born
subjects
should
you
then
desert
him
and
your
country
you
would
disgrace
yourselves
and
dishonour
me
by
refusing
to
repose
confidence
in
my
promise
to
defend
you
against
the
zamorin
and
all
his
power
were
it
even
greater
than
it
is
wherefore
i
strictly
enjoin
that
none
of
you
shall
remove
from
cochin
and
i
swear
by
all
that
is
holy
in
our
faith
that
whoever
is
detected
in
the
attempt
shall
be
instantly
hanged
it
is
my
determined
purpose
to
remain
here
and
to
have
the
port
strictly
watched
day
and
night
that
none
of
you
may
escape
let
every
one
of
you
therefore
look
well
to
his
conduct
and
be
assured
if
you
do
as
i
require
you
shall
have
me
for
your
friend
but
if
otherwise
i
shall
be
your
mortal
enemy
and
shall
use
you
worse
even
than
the
zamorin
the
moors
endeavoured
to
clear
themselves
from
what
had
been
alleged
against
them
but
pacheco
would
not
listen
to
their
excuses
and
departed
from
them
in
anger
and
immediately
brought
his
ship
and
one
of
the
caravels
with
two
boats
which
he
anchored
directly
opposite
the
city
of
cochin
with
strict
charges
to
let
no
one
leave
the
city
by
water
he
likewise
appointed
a
number
of
paraws
to
guard
all
the
creeks
and
rivers
around
the
city
and
ordered
every
boat
that
could
transport
men
or
goods
to
be
brought
every
night
under
the
guns
of
his
ships
and
returned
to
their
owners
in
the
morning
in
consequence
of
all
these
precautions
the
people
of
cochin
were
so
much
afraid
of
him
that
not
one
of
the
moors
or
malabars
dared
to
leave
the
city
without
his
permission
and
henceforwards
continued
quiet
notwithstanding
all
these
cares
pacheco
used
to
make
nightly
invasions
into
the
island
of
repelim
where
he
burnt
the
towns
slew
the
inhabitants
and
carried
away
much
cattle
and
many
paraws
on
which
account
the
moors
of
cochin
astonished
that
he
could
endure
so
much
fatigue
gave
out
that
he
was
the
devil
mean
time
the
zamorin
collected
his
forces
in
the
island
of
repelim
where
he
was
joined
by
the
lords
of
tanor
bespur
kotugan
korin
and
many
other
malabar
chiefs
making
altogether
an
army
of
men
four
thousand
of
these
were
appointed
to
serve
by
water
in
vessels
called
and
with
pieces
of
cannon
intended
to
batter
the
portuguese
fort
at
cochin
and
the
rest
of
the
troops
were
appointed
to
force
a
passage
across
the
ford
of
the
river
under
the
command
of
naubea
daring
nephew
and
heir
to
the
zamorin
and
elankol
the
lord
of
repelim
intelligence
of
all
this
was
conveyed
to
cochin
and
that
the
zamorin
proposed
to
invade
that
city
by
the
straits
of
cambalan
rodrigo
reynel
who
sent
this
intelligence
by
letter
lay
then
very
sick
and
died
soon
after
on
which
the
zamorin
caused
all
his
goods
to
be
seized
on
the
approach
of
the
zamorin
the
moors
of
cochin
would
very
willingly
have
induced
the
inhabitants
to
run
away
but
durst
not
venture
to
do
so
from
the
fear
they
were
in
of
pacheco
he
on
the
contrary
that
all
might
know
how
little
he
esteemed
the
zamorin
and
all
his
power
made
a
descent
one
night
on
one
of
the
towns
of
repelim
to
which
he
set
fire
but
on
the
coming
up
of
a
great
number
of
armed
naires
he
was
forced
to
retreat
in
great
danger
to
his
boats
having
five
of
his
men
wounded
after
killing
and
wounding
a
great
number
of
the
enemy
on
their
return
to
cochin
the
targets
of
our
men
were
all
stuck
full
of
arrows
so
great
was
the
multitude
of
the
enemies
who
had
assailed
them
the
rajah
came
to
visit
pacheco
at
the
castle
on
his
return
from
this
enterprize
and
expressed
his
satisfaction
at
his
success
which
he
considered
as
a
mighty
affair
especially
as
the
zamorin
and
so
great
an
army
was
in
the
island
pacheco
made
light
of
the
zamorin
and
all
his
force
saying
that
he
anxiously
wished
he
would
come
and
give
battle
as
he
was
not
at
all
afraid
of
the
consequences
trusting
to
the
superior
valour
of
his
own
men
as
the
people
of
cochin
remained
quiet
pacheco
now
prepared
for
defending
the
pass
of
cambalan
leaving
therefore
a
sufficient
force
to
guard
the
castle
and
men
in
the
caravel
under
the
command
of
diego
pereira
to
protect
the
city
and
watch
the
conduct
of
the
moors
taking
with
himself
men
in
one
of
the
caravels
and
several
armed
boats
he
departed
for
cambalan
on
friday
the
of
april
on
passing
the
city
pacheco
landed
to
speak
with
the
rajah
whom
he
found
in
evident
anxiety
but
making
as
if
he
did
not
observe
his
heaviness
pacheco
addressed
him
with
a
cheerful
countenance
saying
that
he
was
just
setting
out
to
defend
him
against
the
zamorin
of
whom
he
had
no
fear
of
giving
a
good
account
after
some
conference
the
rajah
ordered
of
his
naires
out
of
who
were
in
his
service
to
join
pacheco
under
the
command
of
and
the
overseers
of
his
household
and
the
caymal
of
whom
he
directed
to
obey
pacheco
in
all
things
as
if
he
were
himself
present
on
taking
leave
of
pacheco
while
he
exhorted
him
to
use
his
utmost
efforts
for
defending
cochin
against
the
zamorin
he
desired
him
to
be
careful
of
his
own
safety
on
which
so
much
depended
pacheco
arrived
at
the
passage
of
cambalan
two
hours
before
day
and
seeing
no
appearance
of
the
zamorins
approach
he
made
an
attack
on
a
town
on
the
coast
of
the
island
about
the
dawn
which
was
defended
by
naires
all
archers
and
a
small
number
armed
with
calivers
or
all
of
whom
were
embarked
in
certain
paraws
and
endeavoured
to
defend
the
entrance
of
the
harbour
they
were
soon
constrained
by
the
cannon
of
the
portuguese
to
push
for
the
shore
and
quit
their
paraws
but
resisted
all
attempts
of
the
portuguese
to
land
for
near
an
hour
when
they
were
completely
defeated
after
losing
a
great
many
of
their
number
killed
or
wounded
and
our
men
set
the
town
on
fire
having
taken
a
considerable
number
of
cattle
at
this
place
which
he
carried
off
with
him
pacheco
returned
to
defend
the
pass
of
cambalan
at
this
time
the
zamorin
sent
a
message
to
pacheco
offering
him
a
handsome
present
and
proposing
a
treaty
for
a
peace
between
them
but
pacheco
refused
accepting
the
present
and
declared
he
would
never
make
peace
with
him
while
he
continued
at
enmity
with
the
rajah
of
cochin
next
day
the
zamorin
sent
a
second
message
proudly
challenging
him
for
daring
to
obstruct
his
passage
into
the
island
of
cochin
and
offering
him
battle
declaring
his
resolution
to
make
him
a
prisoner
if
he
were
not
slain
in
the
battle
to
this
pacheco
made
answer
that
he
hoped
to
do
the
same
thing
with
the
zamorin
in
honour
of
the
day
which
was
a
solemn
festival
among
the
christians
and
that
the
zamorin
was
much
deceived
by
his
sorcerers
when
they
promised
him
the
victory
on
such
a
day
then
one
of
the
naires
who
accompanied
the
messenger
said
smiling
as
if
in
contempt
that
he
had
few
men
to
perform
so
great
an
exploit
whereas
the
forces
of
the
zamorin
covered
both
the
land
and
the
water
and
could
not
possibly
be
overcome
by
such
a
handful
pacheco
ordered
this
man
to
be
well
bastinadoed
for
his
insolence
and
bid
him
desire
the
zamorin
to
revenge
his
quarrel
if
he
could
that
same
evening
the
rajah
of
cochin
sent
a
farther
reinforcement
to
pacheco
of
naires
of
whom
he
made
no
account
neither
of
these
who
were
with
him
before
believing
they
would
all
run
away
his
sole
reliance
under
god
was
on
his
own
men
who
feasted
themselves
that
night
that
the
zamorin
might
learn
how
much
they
despised
all
his
threats
and
how
eager
they
were
for
battle
early
next
morning
pacheco
made
a
short
speech
to
his
men
exhorting
them
to
behave
valiantly
for
the
glory
of
the
christian
name
and
the
honour
of
their
country
and
promising
them
an
assured
victory
with
the
assistance
of
god
by
which
their
fame
would
be
so
established
among
the
natives
that
they
would
be
feared
and
respected
ever
after
he
likewise
set
before
them
the
rewards
they
might
assuredly
expect
from
their
own
sovereign
if
they
behaved
gallantly
on
the
present
occasion
his
men
immediately
answered
him
that
they
hoped
in
the
ensuing
battle
to
evince
how
well
they
remembered
his
exhortations
they
all
then
knelt
down
and
sung
the
and
afterwards
an
with
a
loud
voice
just
at
this
time
laurenço
moreno
joined
pacheco
with
four
of
his
men
armed
with
calivers
who
were
all
anxious
to
be
present
in
the
battle
and
of
whose
arrival
the
general
was
extremely
glad
as
he
knew
them
to
be
valiant
soldiers
in
the
course
of
the
night
by
the
advice
of
the
italian
lapidaries
who
had
deserted
to
the
enemy
the
zamorin
caused
a
sconce
or
battery
to
be
erected
directly
over
against
the
place
where
pacheco
was
stationed
on
which
five
pieces
of
ordnance
were
placed
from
which
great
service
was
expected
in
the
ensuing
battle
owing
to
the
narrowness
of
the
pass
on
the
morning
of
palm
sunday
the
zamorin
marched
forwards
with
men
partly
naires
and
part
moors
and
accompanied
by
all
the
rajahs
and
caymals
who
had
joined
him
in
this
war

and
his
brother
namboa
who
were
particularly
attached
to
that
part
of
the
army
composed
of
the
zamorins
immediate
subjects
had
a
large
body
of
men
whose
numbers
i
do
not
particularize
their
warlike
instruments
were
many
and
of
divers
sorts
and
made
a
noise
as
if
heaven
and
earth
were
coming
together
before
day
the
van
of
this
prodigious
army
arrived
at
the
sconce
of
the
italians
and
began
immediately
to
play
off
their
ordnance
against
the
caravel
which
was
so
near
that
it
was
an
absolute
miracle
that
not
a
single
shot
did
any
harm
but
our
cannon
were
better
served
and
every
shot
did
execution
among
the
enemy
and
so
well
did
they
ply
their
guns
that
before
sunrise
above
thirty
discharges
were
made
from
our
caravel
at
the
whole
of
the
enemies
fleet
consisting
of
barks
came
out
of
the
rivers
of
the
island
of
repelim
to
attack
our
small
force
of
these
were
paraws
having
their
sides
defended
with
bags
of
cotton
by
advice
of
the
italians
to
ward
off
our
shot
and
each
of
these
had
men
and
two
pieces
of
ordnance
five
of
the
men
in
each
paraw
being
armed
with
calivers
or
matchlocks
twenty
of
the
foysts
or
large
barks
were
chained
together
as
a
floating
battery
to
assault
the
caravel
besides
which
there
were
and
thirty
large
barks
each
of
which
carried
sixteen
men
and
one
piece
of
ordnance
besides
other
weapons
besides
all
these
armed
vessels
there
were
a
great
many
more
filled
with
soldiers
so
that
the
whole
river
seemed
entirely
covered
over
of
this
numerous
fleet
which
contained
near
men
naubea
daring
was
admiral
or
commander
in
chief
and
the
lord
of
repelim
all
these
advanced
against
the
portuguese
setting
up
terrible
shouts
which
was
answered
alternately
by
sounding
all
their
military
instruments
of
music
the
whole
of
these
people
were
almost
naked
having
targets
of
various
colours
and
made
a
very
gallant
appearance
on
the
approach
of
this
prodigious
fleet
our
caravel
and
boats
were
hardly
discernible
so
completely
did
the
enemy
cover
the
face
of
the
water
terrified
by
so
prodigious
a
multitude
the
naires
of
cochin
all
ran
away
only
grandagora
and
frangora
remaining
who
were
on
board
the
caravel
or
they
would
have
done
like
the
rest
indeed
their
presence
was
of
no
importance
except
to
serve
as
witnesses
of
the
valour
of
our
men
our
people
plied
their
ordnance
and
small
arms
so
incessantly
that
the
air
was
quite
darkened
with
smoke
and
as
the
boats
of
the
enemy
were
very
numerous
and
without
order
they
hindered
each
other
and
our
fire
did
prodigious
execution
among
them
several
of
their
paraws
being
torn
to
pieces
and
great
numbers
of
their
men
killed
and
wounded
without
any
hurt
on
our
side
the
paraws
which
were
chained
together
were
now
brought
forwards
and
gave
much
annoyance
to
our
men
who
were
now
likewise
much
fatigued
as
the
battle
had
continued
a
long
time
the
gave
orders
to
fire
off
a
which
had
not
been
hitherto
used
during
the
battle
by
the
time
this
had
been
twice
fired
it
did
such
terrible
execution
among
the
thick
of
the
enemy
as
to
sink
four
of
their
paraws
and
all
the
others
made
the
best
of
their
way
out
of
the
battle
eighteen
of
the
paraws
being
sunk
in
all
and
vast
numbers
of
the
enemy
slain
and
wounded
on
the
defeat
of
this
squadron
which
was
commanded
by
prince
naubea
daring
elankol
the
lord
of
repelim
who
was
came
forward
with
a
fresh
squadron
and
gave
a
proud
onset
commanding
his
paraws
to
lay
the
caravel
on
board
but
the
malabars
had
not
resolution
to
put
this
order
into
execution
and
held
off
at
some
distance
the
zamorin
also
approached
with
the
land
army
doing
his
utmost
to
force
the
passage
of
the
ford
but
all
their
efforts
were
in
vain
although
this
second
battle
was
more
fiercely
urged
than
the
first
though
the
battle
continued
from
daybreak
to
almost
sunset
the
enemy
were
able
to
make
no
impression
and
were
known
to
have
lost
men
slain
outright
besides
others
which
were
above
some
of
our
men
were
wounded
but
none
slain
for
the
balls
of
the
enemy
though
of
cast
iron
had
no
more
effect
than
as
many
stones
thrown
by
hand
yet
our
barricades
of
defence
were
all
torn
to
pieces
and
one
of
our
boats
was
very
much
damaged
which
was
entirely
repaired
during
the
night
the
rajahs
and
other
chiefs
who
were
allied
with
the
zamorin
lost
all
hope
of
ever
being
able
to
get
the
victory
over
the
portuguese
and
were
sorry
for
having
joined
in
the
war
so
greatly
to
their
own
dishonour
being
afraid
the
might
burn
and
destroy
their
towns
and
houses
which
were
all
situated
on
the
banks
of
rivers
they
were
anxious
to
leave
the
army
of
the
zamorin
and
to
give
over
making
war
on
the
portuguese
some
among
them
withdrew
privately
from
the
camp
of
the
zamorin
to
the
island
of
vaipi
with
all
their
men
and
reconciled
themselves
with
the
rajah
of
cochin
these
were
caymal
his
brother
and
cousins
the
zamorin
was
exceedingly
mortified
by
the
discomfiture
of
his
people
and
severely
reprimanded
his
chiefs
for
their
pusillanimous
conduct
in
allowing
themselves
to
be
defeated
by
such
a
handful
of
men
the
two
italian
deserters
while
they
acknowledged
the
valour
of
the
portuguese
in
the
late
action
represented
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
continue
to
bear
up
long
against
such
vast
odds
without
reinforcements
and
recommended
the
frequent
reiteration
of
assaults
under
which
they
must
necessarily
be
at
last
overthrown
all
those
rajahs
and
chiefs
who
were
for
continuing
the
war
joined
in
opinion
with
the
italians
the
zamorin
made
a
speech
in
which
he
recapitulated
the
defeats
they
had
sustained
and
the
defection
of
some
of
his
allies
who
had
entered
into
treaty
with
the
rajah
of
cochin
he
stated
how
short
a
period
of
the
summer
now
remained
for
continuing
the
operations
of
the
war
which
must
soon
be
laid
aside
during
the
storms
and
rain
of
the
winter
season
when
it
was
impossible
to
keep
the
field
and
that
on
the
conclusion
of
winter
a
new
fleet
would
come
from
portugal
with
powerful
reinforcements
to
the
enemy
who
would
then
be
able
to
carry
the
war
as
formerly
into
his
dominions
to
their
utter
loss
and
destruction
he
concluded
by
giving
his
opinion
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
make
peace
with
the
christians
naubea
daring
the
prince
of
calicut
made
a
long
speech
in
which
he
defended
the
portuguese
against
the
imputation
thrown
upon
them
by
the
moors
of
their
being
thieves
and
pirates
he
recapitulated
all
their
conduct
since
their
first
arrival
in
india
showing
that
they
had
always
conducted
themselves
with
good
faith
whereas
they
had
been
forced
into
war
against
calicut
by
treachery
and
oppression
he
concluded
by
strongly
recommending
to
negotiate
peace
with
the
christians
as
otherwise
the
city
and
trade
of
calicut
would
be
utterly
destroyed
to
the
irreparable
injury
of
the
zamorins
revenue
which
was
of
more
importance
to
him
than
the
friendship
of
the
moors
whose
only
object
was
their
own
profit
the
zamorin
was
greatly
moved
by
this
discourse
and
recommended
to
the
other
chiefs
that
they
should
concur
with
the
prince
in
procuring
the
establishment
of
peace
this
opinion
was
by
no
means
relished
by
elankol
the
lord
of
repelim
who
had
confederated
with
the
moors
to
urge
a
continuance
of
the
war
and
endeavoured
to
impress
upon
the
zamorin
that
his
reputation
would
be
destroyed
by
proposing
peace
at
this
time
which
would
be
imputed
to
him
as
an
act
of
cowardice
the
principal
moors
likewise
who
were
present
in
the
council
used
all
their
art
and
influence
to
induce
the
zamorin
to
persevere
and
it
was
at
length
determined
to
continue
the
war
one
a
moor
of
repelim
who
had
been
a
great
traveller
and
had
seen
many
warlike
devices
proposed
a
new
invention
for
attacking
the
caravels
at
the
ford
which
was
considered
to
be
perfectly
irresistible
cogeal
directed
a
floating
castle
to
be
built
of
timber
on
two
boats
or
lighters
which
were
firmly
secured
by
two
beams
at
their
heads
and
sterns
over
this
the
castle
or
square
tower
was
strongly
built
of
beams
joined
together
by
bars
of
iron
and
large
nails
carried
up
to
the
height
of
a
lance
or
spear
and
so
large
that
it
was
able
to
contain
forty
men
with
several
pieces
of
ordnance
it
was
proposed
that
this
castle
should
be
brought
up
to
grapple
with
the
caravels
by
which
the
portuguese
might
be
attacked
on
equal
terms
on
seeing
this
machine
the
zamorin
liberally
rewarded
cogeal
for
his
ingenuity
and
gave
orders
to
have
other
seven
constructed
of
the
same
kind
by
means
of
his
spies
pacheco
got
notice
of
the
construction
of
these
floating
castles
and
likewise
that
the
enemy
were
preparing
certain
fireworks
to
set
the
caravels
on
fire
to
keep
off
the
fireships
and
floating
castles
he
constructed
a
species
of
rafts
made
of
masts
or
spars
eight
fathoms
long
and
bound
together
with
iron
bolts
and
hoops
several
of
these
which
were
likewise
eight
fathoms
broad
were
moored
with
anchors
and
cables
at
the
distance
of
a
stones
throw
from
the
caravels
likewise
to
prevent
the
caravels
from
being
overlooked
by
the
floating
castles
one
peter
raphael
built
certain
turrets
on
the
decks
of
the
caravels
of
spars
set
upright
in
each
of
which
seven
or
eight
men
had
room
to
handle
their
arms
at
this
time
the
rajah
of
cochin
visited
pacheco
whom
he
earnestly
exhorted
to
provide
well
for
defence
against
the
zamorin
as
he
was
well
assured
his
own
subjects
would
desert
him
if
pacheco
were
defeated
pacheco
upbraided
trimumpara
for
his
tears
desiring
him
to
call
in
mind
the
victories
which
the
portuguese
had
already
gained
over
the
enemy
and
requested
of
him
to
return
to
his
capital
showing
himself
confident
among
his
people
and
to
rest
assured
that
he
and
the
portuguese
would
keep
the
pass
against
every
force
the
zamorin
might
bring
against
it
in
expectation
of
an
immediate
attack
lorenco
moreno
returned
to
the
caravels
with
as
many
of
his
people
as
could
be
spared
from
the
factory
pacheco
made
all
his
people
take
rest
early
in
the
night
that
they
might
be
able
for
the
expected
fatigues
of
the
ensuing
day
on
which
he
had
intelligence
that
the
grand
attack
was
to
be
made
about
midnight
his
small
force
was
summoned
under
arms
when
after
confession
and
absolution
he
made
a
speech
to
his
men
exhorting
them
to
behave
themselves
manfully
in
the
approaching
conflict
they
all
answered
that
they
were
resolved
to
conquer
or
die
about
two
in
the
morning
some
of
the
most
advanced
vessels
belonging
to
the
calicut
fleet
began
to
fire
off
their
ordnance
as
they
approached
towards
the
pass
the
zamorin
was
himself
along
with
the
land
army
which
exceeded
men
accompanied
with
many
field
pieces
elankol
the
lord
of
repelim
who
commanded
the
vanguard
advanced
to
the
point
of
which
in
some
measure
commanded
the
ford
at
which
place
he
began
to
throw
up
some
ramparts
or
defences
of
earth
pacheco
landed
secretly
at
the
point
with
a
detachment
of
his
troops
on
purpose
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
throwing
up
entrenchments
and
a
sharp
skirmish
ensued
in
which
many
of
the
enemy
were
slain
on
the
appearance
of
day
pacheco
retired
to
his
boats
though
with
no
small
difficulty
owing
to
the
vast
numbers
of
the
enemy
who
thronged
around
yet
got
off
with
all
his
people
unhurt
having
effectually
hindered
the
proposed
intrenchments
the
land
army
of
the
enemy
now
brought
their
ordnance
to
the
point
where
they
began
a
furious
cannonade
upon
the
caravels
yet
without
doing
us
any
harm
as
our
people
were
all
effectually
secured
by
means
of
high
wooden
defences
on
the
gunwales
of
their
vessels
whereas
every
shot
of
ours
made
prodigious
havoc
among
the
enemy
who
were
quite
unsheltered
the
zamorin
sent
orders
to
his
fleet
to
come
on
with
all
expedition
to
deliver
him
and
his
men
from
this
imminent
danger
the
calicut
fleet
now
approached
in
most
formidable
order
having
several
fire
rafts
in
front
intended
for
setting
our
caravels
on
fire
after
them
came
paraws
full
of
men
and
every
one
of
them
having
ordnance
many
of
these
being
fastened
together
by
means
of
chains
after
these
came
and
eighty
each
of
which
had
a
piece
of
ordnance
and
thirty
men
in
the
rear
of
all
came
the
eight
castles
which
kept
close
by
the
point
of
as
the
was
not
yet
altogether
the
enemy
came
on
with
loud
shouts
and
the
sound
of
many
instruments
as
if
to
an
assured
victory
and
immediately
began
a
furious
cannonade
their
fire
rafts
advanced
burning
in
a
most
alarming
manner
but
were
stopped
by
the
or
rafts
of
defence
formerly
mentioned
by
these
likewise
the
paraws
and
other
vessels
of
the
enemy
were
prevented
from
closing
with
our
caravels
and
boats
which
they
seem
to
have
intended
in
this
part
of
the
battle
many
of
the
paraws
and
other
vessels
of
the
enemy
were
torn
to
pieces
and
sunk
and
a
great
number
of
their
men
were
killed
and
wounded
on
the
turn
of
the
tide
the
floating
castles
put
off
from
the
point
and
were
towed
by
boats
towards
the
caravels
in
the
largest
of
these
castles
there
were
forty
men
in
others
and
the
smallest
had
thirty
all
armed
with
bows
or
matchlocks
besides
ordnance
and
they
seemed
quite
an
irresistible
force
in
comparison
of
ours
which
consisted
only
of
two
caravels
and
two
armed
boats
when
the
largest
castle
came
up
to
our
floating
defence
it
immediately
commenced
a
tremendous
fire
of
all
its
ordnance
upon
our
caravels
and
at
this
time
pacheco
ordered
a
to
be
shot
off
which
seemed
to
do
very
little
harm
even
at
a
second
discharge
the
remainder
of
the
castles
now
came
into
their
stations
and
the
battle
raged
with
the
utmost
fury
what
with
incessant
flights
of
arrows
and
the
smoke
of
so
many
guns
our
people
could
seldom
see
the
vessels
of
the
enemy
in
this
extremity
the
saker
was
discharged
a
third
time
against
the
largest
castle
which
had
been
somewhat
shaken
by
the
two
former
discharges
by
this
shot
its
iron
work
was
broken
some
of
its
beams
were
forced
from
their
places
and
several
of
the
men
on
board
were
slain
by
two
other
discharges
of
the
saker
this
castle
was
all
torn
in
pieces
and
was
forced
to
retire
out
of
the
battle
still
however
the
rest
of
the
castles
and
the
numerous
fleet
of
small
craft
kept
up
the
fight
towards
evening
all
the
castles
were
much
injured
many
of
the
paraws
were
sunk
and
torn
in
pieces
and
great
numbers
of
the
enemy
slain
so
that
at
length
they
were
constrained
to
retire
on
our
side
not
one
man
was
even
wounded
one
only
ball
went
through
the
caravel
in
which
pacheco
commanded
and
passed
among
many
of
his
men
without
doing
any
hurt
on
the
enemy
retiring
pacheco
gave
chase
in
the
two
boats
and
some
paraws
and
the
caravels
kept
up
a
constant
fire
upon
point
whence
they
forced
the
zamorin
and
the
land
army
to
retire
after
having
of
his
men
slain
after
this
great
victory
the
inhabitants
of
cochin
became
quite
reassured
and
were
no
longer
in
dread
of
the
power
of
the
zamorin
trimumpara
came
to
visit
pacheco
whom
he
embraced
and
congratulated
on
his
great
prowess
many
of
the
principal
naires
of
cochin
went
to
compliment
him
and
even
numbers
of
the
moorish
merchants
brought
him
rich
presents
hoping
to
secure
his
favour
the
zamorin
was
greatly
disheartened
by
the
overthrow
of
all
his
mighty
preparations
and
losing
all
hope
of
victory
wished
seriously
to
end
the
war
in
a
council
of
his
allies
and
great
men
they
represented
the
great
losses
they
had
already
endured
in
the
war
with
the
portuguese
and
proposed
to
treat
with
them
for
peace
his
brother
naubea
daring
who
had
always
been
averse
to
the
war
seemed
to
believe
that
pacheco
would
refuse
any
treaty
and
advised
rather
to
defer
making
an
offer
of
peace
till
the
arrival
of
the
next
from
portugal
this
prince
was
likewise
of
opinion
that
the
calicut
army
should
still
keep
the
field
till
the
coming
on
of
the
rainy
season
made
it
advisable
to
retire
as
it
would
look
like
flight
to
retreat
at
this
time
yet
he
recommended
that
no
more
attacks
should
be
made
on
the
pass
in
which
attempts
they
had
already
met
with
so
much
loss
elankol
the
lord
of
repelim
urged
the
continuance
of
the
war
and
to
make
reiterated
assaults
on
the
christians
which
must
be
at
last
successful
by
which
means
all
the
portuguese
that
were
in
cochin
cananor
and
coulan
would
be
destroyed
he
advised
likewise
to
send
false
intelligence
to
these
places
saying
that
they
had
taken
our
caravels
and
slain
all
our
men
on
which
news
the
people
of
cananor
and
coulan
would
put
the
people
in
our
factories
to
death
this
was
accordingly
done
but
as
the
inhabitants
of
these
places
had
already
received
notice
of
the
real
state
of
affairs
they
gave
no
credit
to
this
false
story
yet
owing
to
the
malice
of
the
moors
who
dwelt
in
these
places
our
men
were
in
great
danger
and
durst
not
come
out
of
their
factories
and
one
of
our
men
was
slain
in
coulan
by
the
persuasion
of
elankol
and
the
moors
the
zamorin
reluctantly
consented
to
try
the
event
of
another
battle
and
the
castles
being
repaired
a
fresh
assault
was
made
both
by
land
and
water
with
many
more
men
and
vessels
than
before
this
battle
continued
longer
than
the
other
and
the
enemy
was
overthrown
with
far
greater
loss
than
they
had
ever
received
before
in
consequence
of
this
new
victory
the
inhabitants
of
cochin
became
quite
confident
in
their
security
from
the
power
of
their
enemies
and
the
rajah
who
had
hitherto
been
in
much
dread
of
the
event
became
quite
elated
he
now
came
to
visit
pacheco
in
a
chair
of
state
with
far
more
splendour
than
he
had
ever
assumed
since
the
commencement
of
the
war
when
this
was
told
in
the
enemies
camp
the
chiefs
urged
the
zamorin
to
a
fresh
attack
lest
the
rajah
of
cochin
might
hold
him
in
contempt
he
desired
them
to
cease
their
evil
counsels
from
which
he
had
already
sustained
great
loss
and
which
would
still
lead
him
into
greater
danger
but
to
leave
him
to
consider
what
was
best
to
be
done
for
revenge
against
his
enemies
the
zamorin
gave
orders
to
some
of
his
naires
in
whom
he
reposed
great
confidence
that
they
should
go
to
cochin
on
some
false
pretence
and
endeavour
to
assassinate
the
general
of
the
portuguese
and
such
of
his
men
as
they
could
meet
with
but
the
naires
are
an
inconsiderate
people
unable
to
keep
any
of
their
affairs
secret
so
that
this
shameful
device
became
immediately
known
to
pacheco
who
appointed
two
companies
of
the
cochin
naires
to
keep
strict
watch
for
these
one
company
at
the
ford
and
the
other
along
the
river
waiting
by
turns
day
and
night
by
this
means
these
were
detected
and
made
prisoners
the
chief
was
a
naire
of
cochin
of
the
family
or
stock
of
the
who
had
certain
other
naires
attending
upon
him
who
were
strangers
on
being
brought
before
him
he
ordered
them
to
be
all
cruelly
whipt
and
then
to
be
hanged
the
cochin
naires
remonstrated
against
this
punishment
because
they
were
naires
whose
customs
did
not
allow
of
this
mode
of
execution
but
he
would
not
listen
to
their
arguments
saying
that
their
treachery
richly
merited
to
be
so
punished
the
portuguese
officers
represented
to
him
the
great
troubles
which
the
of
cochin
had
endured
for
giving
protection
to
their
nation
and
how
much
this
action
might
displease
him
when
he
was
informed
of
naires
having
been
put
to
death
in
his
dominions
without
his
authority
besides
that
this
might
give
occasion
to
some
of
those
about
the
rajah
who
were
known
to
be
already
unfriendly
to
the
portuguese
to
insinuate
that
the
general
had
usurped
the
authority
from
the
rajah
and
might
in
that
way
wean
his
affections
from
them
pacheco
was
convinced
by
these
arguments
that
he
had
acted
wrong
and
immediately
sent
to
countermand
the
execution
two
of
them
were
already
but
who
were
still
he
sent
to
the
rajah
informing
him
that
they
had
deserved
death
but
that
from
respect
to
him
he
had
spared
their
lives
the
rajah
was
singularly
gratified
by
this
mark
of
respect
and
the
more
so
because
there
happened
to
be
then
present
several
of
his
principal
nobles
and
some
chiefs
from
other
places
besides
sundry
of
the
chief
of
the
moors
of
cochin
who
had
endeavoured
to
impress
on
his
mind
that
the
portuguese
were
willing
to
assume
the
command
in
his
dominions
henceforwards
pacheco
had
such
good
intelligence
that
all
the
subtle
devices
of
the
zamorin
were
counteracted
the
month
of
june
was
now
ended
and
the
rainy
season
or
winter
began
to
come
on
from
which
pacheco
naturally
concluded
that
the
zomorin
would
soon
break
up
his
encampment
on
which
occasion
he
was
fully
resolved
to
give
them
an
assault
having
sufficient
experience
of
the
pusillanimity
of
the
enemy
but
the
zamorin
being
afraid
that
pacheco
might
attack
him
at
his
departure
gave
out
that
he
intended
to
make
another
assault
on
the
ford
with
a
greater
fleet
than
ever
and
even
directed
the
floating
castles
to
be
repaired
he
even
gave
out
that
he
meant
to
assail
the
passage
of
and
the
ford
both
at
once
that
pacheco
might
occupy
himself
in
preparing
to
defend
both
places
and
he
might
have
the
better
opportunity
to
steal
away
unperceived
accordingly
on
the
evening
of
saturday
which
was
the
eve
of
st
john
the
whole
army
of
the
enemy
appeared
as
usual
and
pacheco
fully
expected
to
have
been
attacked
that
night
next
morning
however
he
learnt
from
two
bramins
that
the
zamorin
had
withdrawn
with
all
his
army
into
the
island
of
repelim
pacheco
was
much
disappointed
at
this
news
yet
he
made
a
descent
that
very
day
into
repelim
where
he
fought
with
many
of
the
enemy
killing
and
wounding
a
great
number
of
them
and
then
returned
to
the
ford
where
he
remained
several
days
because
the
rajah
was
still
afraid
lest
the
zamorin
might
return
and
get
across
the
ford
into
the
island
of
cochin
the
zamorin
was
so
by
the
great
and
repeated
losses
he
had
sustained
in
this
war
from
a
mere
handful
of
men
that
he
resolved
to
retire
into
religions
seclusion
that
he
might
conciliate
the
favour
of
his
gods
and
dismissed
his
allies
and
chiefs
to
act
as
they
thought
best
his
princes
and
nobles
endeavoured
to
dissuade
him
from
this
resolution
but
he
continued
firm
to
his
purpose
and
went
into
the
or
religious
state
of
seclusion
accompanied
by
some
of
his
chief
bramins
or
chaplains
soon
afterwards
his
mother
sent
him
word
that
great
changes
had
taken
place
in
calicut
since
his
seclusion
that
many
of
the
merchants
had
already
deserted
the
place
and
others
were
preparing
to
follow
that
the
city
was
becoming
ill
provided
with
victuals
as
those
who
used
to
import
them
were
afraid
of
the
christians
yet
she
advised
him
never
to
return
to
calicut
unless
he
could
do
so
with
honour
and
that
he
should
therefore
continue
in
seclusion
for
a
time
and
afterwards
endeavour
to
recover
his
credit
and
reputation
by
victory
or
lose
all
in
the
attempt
on
this
message
which
greatly
increased
his
discontent
the
zamorin
sent
for
his
brother
to
whom
he
confided
the
government
of
his
dominions
till
such
time
as
he
should
have
completed
his
religious
austerities
in
seclusion
on
this
strange
resolution
of
the
zamorin
the
rajahs
and
nobles
who
had
joined
him
in
the
war
departed
to
their
own
countries
most
of
which
lay
on
the
coast
and
being
under
great
apprehensions
that
pacheco
might
reduce
their
dominions
they
endeavoured
to
enter
into
treaties
with
him
for
peace
and
concord
for
which
purpose
they
sent
messages
to
trimumpara
requesting
that
he
would
act
as
mediator
between
them
and
pacheco
the
rajah
of
cochin
was
a
prince
of
a
mild
and
forgiving
disposition
and
forgetting
all
the
past
injuries
they
had
done
him
in
these
wars
he
undertook
the
office
of
mediation
and
sent
them
safe
conducts
to
come
to
cochin
to
make
their
peace
on
their
arrival
he
accompanied
them
to
wait
upon
pacheco
and
even
became
their
advocate
with
him
to
accept
of
their
proferred
friendship
which
he
readily
consented
to
at
the
desire
of
the
rajah
some
of
these
princes
were
unable
to
come
personally
but
sent
their
ambassadors
to
solicit
peace
which
was
accorded
to
all
who
asked
it
several
even
of
the
great
moorish
merchants
of
calicut
that
they
might
quietly
enjoy
their
trade
forsook
that
place
and
came
to
dwell
in
cochin
having
previously
secured
the
consent
of
pacheco
others
of
them
went
to
cananor
and
coulan
by
which
means
the
great
trade
which
used
to
be
carried
on
at
calicut
suddenly
fell
off
owing
to
the
great
resort
of
moors
to
cochin
in
whom
pacheco
could
not
repose
much
confidence
and
because
by
the
orders
of
naubea
daring
the
paraws
of
calicut
frequently
made
excursions
into
the
rivers
the
general
continued
for
a
long
while
to
defend
the
passage
of
the
ford
where
he
often
fought
with
and
did
much
injury
to
his
enemies
he
made
frequent
incursions
likewise
into
the
island
of
repelim
whence
he
carried
off
cattle
and
other
provisions
and
often
fought
with
his
enemies
always
defeating
them
with
much
slaughter
at
length
elankol
the
lord
of
that
island
wishing
to
put
an
end
to
the
miseries
of
his
country
waited
on
pacheco
and
entered
into
a
treaty
of
friendship
with
him
making
him
a
present
of
a
great
quantity
of
pepper
which
was
abundant
in
his
country
this
paragraph
enumerating
the
forces
of
the
zamorin
is
added
to
the
text
of
castaneda
from
astley
vol
the
particular
distribution
of
the
force
under
pacheco
at
this
time
is
thus
enumerated
in
astleys
collection
in
the
fort
men
in
the
ship
left
to
defend
cochin
in
the
caravel
which
accompanied
him
in
the
expedition
to
cambalan
into
one
boat
and
in
the
boat
along
with
himself
making
his
whole
effective
force
men
only
of
which
went
along
with
him
to
defend
the
astl
i
a
very
short
space
before
these
are
only
stated
as
twenty
but
the
numbers
and
names
in
the
text
seem
much
e
in
a
former
note
we
have
given
a
list
of
the
names
and
circumstances
of
the
english
ordnance
near
this
period
in
that
list
the
saker
is
described
as
a
light
cannon
of
only
pound
ball
now
looked
upon
as
one
of
very
small
importance
we
may
therefore
conclude
that
the
other
cannon
used
on
the
present
occasion
could
hardly
exceed
or
e
such
is
the
unintelligible
expression
in
lichefilds
translation
in
the
account
of
this
war
compiled
by
the
editor
of
astleys
collection
from
the
portuguese
historians
the
enemy
are
said
to
have
lost
in
the
former
part
of
this
battle
twenty
paraws
sunk
persons
of
note
and
above
common
men
while
in
the
second
attack
nineteen
paraws
were
sunk
fled
and
men
were
slain
in
this
account
a
third
naval
engagement
is
mentioned
in
which
paraws
were
sunk
and
sixty
fled
after
which
men
were
defeated
by
land
and
four
towns
were
burnt
by
astl
i
castaneda
tells
a
long
ridiculous
story
at
this
place
of
a
ceremonial
defiance
of
the
zamorin
not
worth
inserting
in
astley
i
we
are
told
that
the
moors
of
cochin
were
detected
about
this
time
communicating
intelligence
to
the
enemy
and
that
trimumpara
allowed
pacheco
to
punish
them
on
which
he
put
five
of
their
chief
men
into
strict
confinement
giving
out
that
they
were
hanged
which
gave
much
offence
to
the
rajah
and
his
e
such
are
the
words
of
lichefild
which
perhaps
may
have
been
intended
to
imply
that
there
was
not
yet
sufficient
depth
of
water
to
allow
of
their
approach
to
the
caravels
or
it
may
mean
that
they
waited
for
the
tide
of
ebb
to
carry
them
towards
the
portuguese
caravels
being
too
cumbrous
for
management
by
means
of
e
this
seems
the
same
story
which
has
been
already
mentioned
in
a
former
note
from
astleys
collection
but
which
is
there
related
as
having
taken
place
with
e
the
nativity
of
st
john
the
baptist
is
the
june
the
eve
therefore
is
the
yet
castaneda
has
already
said
that
june
was
e
about
this
time
in
consequence
of
a
message
from
the
portuguese
factor
at
coulan
stating
that
the
moors
obstructed
the
market
for
pepper
pacheco
went
to
that
place
where
he
made
five
moorish
ships
submit
and
settled
the
pepper
market
on
fair
terms
yet
without
doing
them
any
astl
i
according
to
astley
the
zamorin
lost
men
in
this
war
in
five
months
and
desired
peace
which
was
granted
by
the
rajah
of
astl
i
yet
this
could
hardly
be
the
case
as
the
first
operation
of
the
new
in
india
was
to
cannonade
e
section
ix
voyage
of
lope
suarez
de
menesis
to
india
in
being
the
sixth
of
the
portuguese
expeditions
to
the
east
learning
the
necessity
of
sending
powerful
succours
to
protect
the
portuguese
trade
from
the
hostilities
of
the
zamorin
the
king
of
portugal
fitted
out
a
fleet
of
twelve
large
ships
in
of
which
the
command
was
given
to
lope
suarez
de
menesis
who
had
been
captain
of
the
on
the
coast
of
guinea
in
the
reign
of
john
ii
the
captains
of
these
ships
were
pedro

and
pedro

de
sutunell
all
of
whom
were
gentlemen
by
birth
or
service
having
embarked
many
valiant
soldiers
the
whole
fleet
left
lisbon
on
the
of
april
and
arrived
on
the
of
may
near
cape
verd
having
observed
during
this
part
of
the
voyage
that
several
of
the
ships
were
very
irregularly
navigated
not
keeping
in
their
proper
course
by
which
they
had
run
foul
of
each
other
some
pushing
before
while
others
lagged
behind
and
others
stood
athwart
the
order
of
the
fleet
suarez
convened
an
assemblage
of
all
the
captains
masters
and
pilots
of
the
fleet
to
whom
he
communicated
the
following
written
instructions
as
soon
as
it
is
night
every
ship
shall
keep
in
regular
order
of
the
admiral
and
no
vessel
to
carry
any
light
except
in
the
binnacle
and
in
the
cabin
the
masters
and
pilots
to
keep
regular
watch
taking
special
care
not
to
run
foul
of
each
other
all
to
answer
the
signals
of
the
admiral
as
soon
as
day
appears
every
ship
shall
come
to
salute
the
admiral
and
all
are
carefully
to
avoid
getting
before
him
during
the
night
the
penalty
for
breach
of
any
of
these
articles
was
a
fine
of
ten
crowns
besides
which
the
offender
was
to
be
put
under
arrest
without
being
entitled
to
wages
and
so
to
remain
to
the
end
of
the
voyage
as
some
of
the
masters
and
pilots
had
been
very
negligent
allowing
some
of
the
ships
to
fall
aboard
of
others
he
removed
these
to
other
ships
by
this
attention
to
discipline
the
fleet
was
kept
afterwards
in
good
sailing
order
in
the
month
of
june
at
which
time
they
reckoned
themselves
off
the
cape
of
good
hope
the
fleet
was
surprised
by
a
heavy
storm
and
had
to
drive
for
two
days
and
nights
under
bare
poles
in
imminent
danger
of
being
cast
away
the
weather
during
all
this
time
being
wonderfully
dark
so
that
the
ships
were
in
great
hazard
of
running
aboard
of
each
other
to
guard
against
this
danger
the
admiral
caused
guns
to
be
fired
at
intervals
from
all
the
ships
to
give
notice
of
their
situations
and
the
better
to
keep
company
on
the
subsidence
of
the
storm
the
ship
commanded
by
lope
mendez
was
missing
and
the
admiral
caused
the
fleet
to
lie
to
for
some
days
in
hopes
of
her
reappearance
while
in
this
situation
two
of
the
ships
ran
foul
of
each
other
by
which
a
large
hole
was
broken
in
the
bow
of
one
of
the
ships
through
which
she
took
in
so
much
water
as
to
be
in
great
danger
of
sulking
the
admiral
immediately
bore
up
to
her
assistance
and
encouraged
the
crew
to
stop
the
leak
and
even
sent
his
boats
on
board
to
give
every
aid
by
great
exertions
they
got
the
leak
effectually
stopped
by
nailing
hides
over
the
hole
and
covering
the
whole
with
pitch
on
st
jameses
day
july
the
fleet
arrived
at
mozambique
where
they
were
well
received
by
the
governor
who
supplied
them
abundantly
with
fresh
provisions
and
sent
off
the
letter
which
pedro
de
tayde
had
written
respecting
the
state
of
affairs
in
india
a
short
time
before
his
death
as
formerly
mentioned
the
admiral
expedited
the
refitting
of
the
ships
which
had
been
so
much
injured
as
quickly
as
possible
and
departed
from
mozambique
on
the
of
august
the
king
of
melinda
sent
off
one
of
his
principal
moors
to
visit
the
admiral
to
whom
likewise
he
sent
sixteen
of
our
men
who
had
deserted
from
pedro
de
tayde
having
stopt
only
two
days
at
melinda
for
refreshment
the
fleet
sailed
across
for
india
and
came
to
anchediva
where
they
found
two
portuguese
ships
commanded
by
antonio
de
saldanna
and
ruy
lorenzo
who
were
much
afraid
of
our
fleet
suspecting
it
to
have
belonged
to
the
rumes
saldanna
informed
suarez
that
he
had
been
sent
out
the
year
before
from
portugal
along
with
lorenzo
as
with
orders
to
explore
the
red
sea
and
adjacent
countries
that
they
were
separated
in
a
storm
off
the
cape
of
good
hope
that
lorenzo
proceeding
alone
in
the
voyage
had
taken
a
ship
belonging
to
the
moors
near
sofala
out
of
which
he
had
taken
a
large
quantity
of
gold
and
had
left
the
hull
at
melinda
that
saldanna
prosecuted
his
voyage
to
cape
guardafui
where
he
had
taken
many
rich
prizes
without
having
entered
the
red
sea
after
which
he
had
sailed
to
india
and
the
winter
coming
on
had
taken
shelter
in
anchediva
where
he
was
afterwards
joined
by
lorenzo

this
place

de
vasconcelles
who
had
been
separated
in
the
storm
off
the
cape
of
good
hope
rejoined
the
fleet
the
admiral
used
every
expedition
to
get
the
fleet
ready
to
proceed
for
cananor
where
he
arrived
on
the
of
september
and
was
informed
by
the
factor
of
the
events
in
the
war
with
calicut
and
how
he
and
his
companions
in
the
factory
had
been
often
in
great
hazard
of
their
lives
the
day
after
his
arrival
the
admiral
went
on
shore
in
great
state
to
visit
the
rajah
of
cananor
attended
by
all
the
captains
of
the
fleet

dressed
in
their

had
a
rich

was
dressed

two
lackeys
preceded
him
in
splendid
attire
and
six
trumpeters
with
silk
flags
he
was
also
accompanied
by
a
band
of
wind
instruments
in
a
small
boat
in
another
boat
were
the
presents
which
he
carried
for
the
rajah
from
the
king
of
portugal
there
were
six
beds
of
fine
holland
with
their
pillows
of
the
same
all
wrought

broad
the
bedstead
was
gilded
all
over
having
curtains
of
crimson
satin
fringed
with
cold
thread
on
putting
off
from
his
ship
all
the
fleet
saluted
him
with
their
cannon
then
the
trumpets
and
drums
sounded
for
a
long
time
after
which
the
organs
never
ceased
to
play
till
the
boats
reached
the
shore
where
vast
numbers
of
moors
and
gentiles
waited
to
receive
the
admiral
on
his
landing
the
admiral
was
conducted
into
a
or
house
appointed
for
his
reception
and
audience
of
the
rajah
in
which
he
ordered
the
bed
and
all
its
rich
furniture
to
be
set
up
close
to
which
was
placed
a
chair
for
the
admiral
to
sit
upon
soon
afterwards
the
rajah
was
brought
to
the
house
carried
in
a
rich
chair
of
state
preceded
by
three
armed
elephants
three
thousand
nayres
armed
with
swords
spears
and
targets
and
two
thousand
armed
with
bows
and
arrows
the
admiral
apprized
of
the
rajah
approach
by
the
fleet
saluting
him
with
all
their
guns
went
to
the
door
to
receive
him
where
they
embraced
then
going
together
into
the
apartment
the
admiral
presented
him
with
the
bed
already
described
on
which
the
rajah
immediately
lay
down
and
the
admiral
sat
down
beside
him
in
the
place
appointed
they
here
conferred
together
for
two
hours
when
they
were
interrupted
by
the
barking
of
a
greyhound
belonging
to
the
admiral
which
wanted
to
attack
one
of
the
elephants
soon
afterwards
a
moor
from
calicut
waited
upon
the
admiral
having
along
with
him
a
portuguese
boy
who
brought
a
letter
from
some
of
our
men
who
were
captives
at
calicut
ever
since
the
time
of
cabral
being
there
this
boy
informed
the
admiral
that
the
zamorin
was
so
humbled
by
the
defeats
he
had
sustained
from
pacheco
that
he
had
gone
into
religious
seclusion
that
many
of
the
moorish
merchants
had
gone
from
calicut
to
other
places
as
they
could
carry
on
no
trade
there
owing
to
the
war
and
that
even
provisions
had
become
extremely
scarce
that
the
zamorin
and
the
prince
of
calicut
and
the
magistrates
of
that
place
were
exceedingly
desirous
of
peace
with
the
portuguese
for
which
reason
they
had
sent
him
to
the
admiral
and
had
allowed
the
portuguese
prisoners
there
to
write
him
to
that
effect
which
they
had
done
accordingly
but
chiefly
in
hopes
that
he
would
free
them
from
captivity
after
reading
the
letter
the
admiral
would
have
sent
a
written
answer
meaning
to
have
sent
it
by
the
moor
but
the
boy
told
him
they
had
no
permission
to
carry
any
letter
and
that
he
must
return
along
with
the
moor
as
the
people
of
calicut
had
threatened
to
put
all
their
portuguese
prisoners
to
death
in
case
he
did
not
return
on
this
account
the
admiral
gave
the
boy
a
verbal
message
for
the
prisoners
saying
that
he
would
very
soon
come
to
calicut
where
he
would
anchor
as
near
as
possible
to
the
shore
and
as
the
captives
were
allowed
to
go
about
the
city
without
irons
they
might
find
an
opportunity
to
come
off
to
the
fleet
either
in
boats
or
by
swimming
suarez
went
accordingly
with
the
fleet
to
calicut
where
he
came
to
anchor
on
saturday
the
september
and
presently
afterwards
the
boy
who
had
been
to
visit
him
at
cananor
came
on
board
accompanied
by
a
servant
of
cosebequin
who
brought
the
admiral
a
present
from
the
rulers
of
cochin
and
a
message
requiring
a
safe
conduct
for
cosebequin
that
he
might
come
on
board
to
treat
for
peace
the
admiral
refused
to
accept
of
any
present
until
such
time
as
peace
were
restored
but
sent
word
that
cosebequin
might
repair
on
board
without
fear
as
a
servant
of
the
king
of
portugal
he
sent
a
private
message
at
the
same
time
to
the
portuguese
prisoners
advising
them
to
use
their
best
endeavours
to
escape
on
receiving
this
message
cosebequin
was
sent
on
board
by
the
governors
of
calicut
to
treat
of
peace
carrying
with
him
two
of
the
portuguese
captives
they
requested
he
would
wait
three
or
four
days
by
which
time
they
believed
the
zamorin
would
come
out
from
his
seclusion
and
that
they
were
convinced
he
would
agree
to
all
that
should
be
required
the
admiral
answered
that
unless
they
would
deliver
up
the
two
italian
deserters
he
would
agree
to
no
terms
but
he
sent
no
message
for
the
liberation
of
our
captives
as
he
thought
they
might
easily
escape
as
soon
as
the
italians
learnt
that
the
admiral
had
demanded
them
they
suspected
the
captives
would
run
away
of
which
circumstance
they
gave
notice
to
the
governors
requiring
them
to
secure
the
portuguese
captives
as
they
were
men
of
consideration
and
that
a
peace
might
be
procured
in
exchange
for
them
almost
on
any
terms
the
zamorin
pleased
to
prescribe
on
this
advice
the
governors
took
care
to
prevent
the
captives
from
escaping
and
became
less
urgent
in
their
desire
of
peace
owing
to
this
they
remained
in
captivity
till
don
francisco
de
almeida
became
viceroy
of
india
though
some
made
their
escape
in
the
interim
and
others
of
them
fell
victims
to
the
diseases
of
the
climate
after
waiting
some
days
and
finding
no
friendly
steps
taken
by
the
governors
of
calicut
towards
a
peace
and
being
likewise
without
hope
of
recovering
the
captives
suarez
resolved
to
take
revenge
by
cannonading
the
city
of
calicut
which
he
did
for
a
whole
day
and
a
night
during
which
time
he
did
prodigious
damage
destroying
the
palace
of
the
zamorin
several
of
their
pagodas
or
idol
temples
and
many
of
the
houses
and
slew
a
great
number
of
the
inhabitants
for
this
service
he
brought
seven
of
his
smallest
ships
as
near
the
shore
as
possible
and
advanced
all
the
boats
of
the
fleet
likewise
carrying
ordnance
close
almost
to
the
beach
after
this
he
departed
for
cochin
where
he
arrived
on
saturday
the
of
september
he
landed
next
day
near
the
portuguese
castle
in
as
great
state
as
he
had
done
before
at
cananor
and
was
received
with
many
marks
of
satisfaction
by
trimumpara
after
embracing
they
went
hand
in
hand
into
the
hall
in
which
a
chair
of
state
was
placed
for
the
admiral
as
the
rajah
sat
on
the
cushions
on
the
floor
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
and
was
therefore
much
lower
than
the
admiral
he
commanded
his
chair
to
be
removed
somewhat
farther
from
the
rajah
by
which
he
greatly
offended
the
native
chiefs
who
were
present
at
the
interview
he
now
delivered
to
trimumpara
a
letter
from
the
king
of
portugal
in
which
great
compliments
and
many
thanks
were
given
for
the
favour
and
protection
the
rajah
had
vouchsafed
to
the
portuguese
to
this
the
rajah
answered
that
he
had
been
amply
repaid
by
the
good
service
which
duarte
pacheco
had
rendered
him
in
the
war
with
the
zamorin
next
day
the
admiral
sent
a
large
sum
of
money
to
trimumpara
as
a
present
from
the
king
of
portugal
who
knew
that
his
finances
had
been
greatly
injured
ill
consequence
of
the
war
with
calicut
soon
after
suarez
sent
pedro
de
mendoza
and
vasco
carvallo
with
their
ships
to
guard
the
coast
of
calicut
with
orders
to
capture
all
ships
belonging
to
the
moors
that
were
laden
with
spices
he
likewise
dispatched
de
la
cocta
aguilar
cotinho
and
abreu
to
go
to
coulan
to
take
in
their
loading
being
informed
that
spices
were
to
be
had
there
in
abundance
he
likewise
sent
tristan
de
la
silva
with
four
armed
boats
up
the
rivers
towards
cranganor
against
some
armed
paraws
of
calicut
which
were
stationed
in
that
quarter
in
this
expedition
silva
had
a
skirmish
with
these
paraws
and
some
nayres
on
the
shores
of
the
rivers
but
falling
in
with
a
moorish
ship
laden
with
pepper
he
captured
her
and
brought
her
to
cochin
where
he
and
the
other
captains
loaded
their
ships
as
spices
were
now
procured
in
great
abundance
duarte
pacheco
happened
to
be
off
coulan
when
he
learnt
the
arrival
of
suarez
and
knowing
that
his
own
command
was
ended
so
soon
as
the
new
should
arrive
at
cochin
determined
to
attempt
some
exploits
while
he
remained
master
of
his
own
conduct
with
this
view
he
put
to
sea
on
the
of
october
and
soon
after
got
sight
of
a
ship
at
a
great
distance
to
which
he
gave
chase
all
that
day
and
part
of
the
night
the
chase
was
driven
into
coulan
when
pacheco
learnt
that
she
to
the
confederates
and
was
bound
from
coromandel
he
immediately
afterwards
descried
three
ships
of
calicut
to
which
he
gave
chase
keeping
as
near
the
coast
a
possible
to
take
the
advantage
of
a
land
breeze
in
the
morning
he
put
off
to
sea
in
chase
of
the
vessel
which
he
was
unable
to
get
up
with
till
towards
evening
close
to
the
land
after
a
brave
defence
as
the
ship
had
many
men
she
at
length
yielded
and
not
chusing
to
encumber
himself
with
so
many
prisoners
he
landed
a
part
of
her
company
and
made
the
rest
prisoners
in
irons
in
his
own
ship
learning
that
this
was
one
of
the
three
ships
belonging
to
calicut
of
which
he
was
in
search
he
put
two
of
his
men
on
board
the
prize
with
orders
to
keep
him
company
being
arrived
directly
abreast
of
cape
comorin
he
met
with
a
sudden
whirlwind
by
which
he
was
nearly
cast
away
and
when
this
subsided
he
came
to
anchor
within
a
league
of
the
shore
where
he
remained
all
night
while
at
anchor
thirty
of
his
moorish
prisoners
made
their
escape
twelve
of
whom
were
retaken
by
means
of
his
boat
pacheco
remained
for
some
time
off
the
cape
in
expectation
of
the
other
ships
of
the
moors
coming
round
from
coromandel
but
none
making
their
appearance
he
went
to
coulan
with
the
ship
he
had
captured
which
he
delivered
to
the
factor
at
that
city
with
all
its
rich
merchandize
he
then
went
to
cochin
where
he
put
himself
under
the
command
of
suarez
the
zamorin
had
now
resumed
the
government
having
withdrawn
from
the
or
religious
seclusion
he
had
dispatched
one
of
his
generals
with
a
fleet
of
eighty
paraws
and
fifty
ships
to
defend
the
passages
of
the
rivers
and
to
obstruct
the
trade
of
cochin
with
the
interior
and
had
likewise
set
on
foot
a
considerable
land
army
under
the
prince
naubea
daring
it
was
the
intention
of
the
zamorin
to
stand
on
the
defensive
only
while
the
portuguese
fleet
remained
in
india
and
to
renew
the
war
against
cochin
after
their
departure
but
the
admiral
suarez
by
the
advice
of
all
his
captains
resolved
to
make
an
attack
on
cranganor
a
town
belonging
to
the
zamorin
about
four
leagues
from
cochin
whence
the
enemy
had
often
done
much
injury
to
the
dominions
of
trimumpara
during
the
late
war
for
this
purpose
suarez
took
fifteen
armed
boats
with
raised
defences
on
their
gunwales
and
paraws
belonging
to
cochin
all
armed
with
cannon
and
accompanied
by
a
caravel
the
whole
manned
with
about
portuguese
soldiers
and
an
equal
number
of
nayres
from
cochin
the
armament
arrived
before
day
at
where
it
had
to
wait
for
daylight
not
daring
to
attempt
the
passage
of
certain
shoals
as
the
boats
were
heavily
laden
on
arriving
at
cranganor
the
fleet
of
calicut
was
found
drawn
up
ready
to
repel
the
portuguese
attack
the
calicut
commander
was
posted
in
the
front
in
two
new
ships
chained
together
which
were
full
of
ordnance
and
well
manned
chiefly
by
archers
in
the
rear
of
these
ships
and
on
both
flanks
the
paraws
of
calicut
were
arranged
all
full
of
armed
men
on
the
arrival
of
the
portuguese
flotilla
the
battle
immediately
commenced
by
the
discharge
of
ordnance
on
both
sides
five
portuguese
captains
who
led
the
van
pushed
on
to
attack
the
calicut
admiral
in
his
two
chained
ships
which
they
carried
by
boarding
after
a
brave
resistance
in
which
that
officer
and
two
of
his
sons
with
many
others
of
the
malabars
were
slain
after
the
capture
of
these
ships
the
paraws
made
little
resistance
and
soon
took
to
flight
suarez
immediately
disembarked
his
troops
which
soon
put
naubea
daring
to
flight
who
commanded
the
land
army
of
calicut
the
moors
and
malabars
in
their
flight
plundered
the
houses
of
cranganor
which
was
immediately
afterwards
set
on
fire
by
the
portuguese
certain
christian
inhabitants
of
the
place
came
to
suarez
and
prayed
him
not
to
burn
their
city
representing
that
it
contained
several
churches
dedicated
to
the
virgin
and
the
apostles
besides
many
christian
houses
which
were
interspersed
among
these
belonging
to
the
moors
and
gentiles
for
their
sakes
suarez
ordered
the
conflagration
to
be
stopped
yet
many
of
the
houses
were
destroyed
before
that
could
be
effected
as
they
were
all
of
wood
after
the
fire
was
quenched
our
men
plundered
the
houses
belonging
to
the
moors
many
of
whom
had
formerly
dwelt
in
cochin
the
two
ships
and
several
paraws
which
had
been
taken
in
the
before
mentioned
engagement
were
set
on
fire
and
other
three
ships
that
were
found
drawn
on
shore
at
this
time
suarez
was
joined
by
the
prince
of
cochin
who
informed
him
that
naubea
daring
remained
with
his
army
at
no
great
distance
and
intended
to
return
to
cranganor
after
his
departure
a
considerable
force
was
therefore
sent
against
naubea
daring
but
immediately
on
seeing
their
approach
the
troops
of
calicut
fled
on
the
return
of
the
portuguese
flotilla
towards
cochin
suarez
was
disposed
to
have
destroyed
another
town
which
lay
near
their
passage
but
the
prince
of
cochin
represented
that
half
of
it
belonged
to
him
and
prevailed
on
the
admiral
to
spare
it
as
he
could
not
destroy
one
part
without
the
other
suarez
therefore
returned
to
cochin
where
he
knighted
some
of
his
officers
for
their
bravery
during
the
last
engagement
a
few
days
after
his
return
there
came
an
ambassador
from
the
rajah
of
whose
dominions
are
next
adjoining
to
those
of
cochin
this
ambassador
represented
that
his
master
had
hitherto
adhered
to
the
zamorin
and
had
assisted
him
in
all
his
wars
against
pacheco
but
that
the
zamorin
since
he
had
come
out
from
his
religious
seclusion
had
redoubled
his
arrogant
ideas
of
his
irresistible
power
and
in
reward
of
the
services
of
the
rajah
of
tanor
now
threatened
him
with
war
and
conquest
he
farther
represented
that
on
the
late
occasion
when
the
general
of
the
calicut
forces
was
in
full
march
for
the
relief
of
cranganor
the
rajah
of
tanor
had
placed
of
his
nayres
in
ambush
in
a
defile
in
their
line
of
march
who
had
defeated
the
troops
of
calicut
and
hod
slain
of
them
on
this
account
the
rajah
of
tanor
was
in
great
fear
of
the
zamorin
and
humbly
requested
assistance
from
the
admiral
promising
in
return
to
become
subject
to
the
king
of
portugal
for
this
purpose
the
admiral
sent
pedro
raphael
in
a
caravel
to
tanor
with
soldiers
most
of
whom
were
crossbow
men
it
chanced
that
on
the
very
day
of
his
arrival
at
tanor
the
zamorin
arrived
before
that
city
with
his
army
and
gave
battle
to
the
rajah
but
chiefly
owing
to
the
valour
of
raphael
and
his
company
the
army
of
the
zamorin
was
defeated
with
great
slaughter
in
reward
for
this
succour
the
rajah
of
tanor
became
subject
to
the
king
of
portugal
in
consequence
of
this
defeat
the
zamorin
was
much
humbled
and
lost
more
credit
with
the
moors
than
by
all
the
victories
which
pacheco
had
obtained
as
these
had
been
obtained
by
strangers
while
the
present
victory
had
been
gained
by
a
native
prince
in
consequence
of
these
reverses
seeing
no
likelihood
of
ever
being
able
to
recover
their
trade
all
the
moors
who
dwelt
in
calicut
and
cranganor
determined
upon
removing
to
their
own
country
with
their
remaining
wealth
for
this
purpose
they
fitted
up
seventeen
large
ships
at
which
they
armed
on
purpose
to
defend
themselves
against
any
attack
from
our
men
and
loaded
them
with
all
expedition
for
mecca
besides
these
they
loaded
a
great
number
of
paraws
and
tonys
with
such
goods
as
the
ships
were
unable
to
contain
the
season
now
approached
for
the
return
of
the
fleet
to
portugal
and
suarez
appointed
manuel
telez
de
vasconcelles
as
of
the
indies
with
whom
he
left
a
ship
and
two
caravels
of
which
last
pedro
raphael
and
diego
perez
were
captains
the
admiral
presented
these
officers
to
the
rajah
of
cochin
who
would
much
rather
have
procured
duarte
pacheco
to
remain
having
great
confidence
in
his
valour
and
attachment
to
his
service
but
dared
not
to
request
this
of
the
admiral
as
he
was
of
a
haughty
disposition
in
a
conference
between
pacheco
and
the
rajah
the
latter
entreated
him
to
remain
in
india
if
possible
as
he
did
not
think
himself
quite
secure
from
the
enmity
of
the
zamorin
and
even
urged
him
to
remember
that
he
had
promised
not
to
leave
him
till
he
had
made
him
king
of
calicut
pacheco
answered
that
he
left
him
in
a
good
situation
his
country
being
restored
to
quiet
and
the
zamorin
so
much
humbled
that
he
was
no
longer
to
be
dreaded
as
a
proof
of
which
the
moors
were
about
to
depart
from
calicut
seeing
their
trade
entirely
ruined
and
that
he
hoped
to
return
from
portugal
and
to
serve
him
longer
and
to
greater
purpose
than
he
had
done
hitherto
the
rajah
was
somewhat
satisfied
with
this
answer
and
craved
pardon
of
pacheco
that
he
had
not
rewarded
his
services
as
they
deserved
because
he
was
extremely
poor
yet
requested
he
would
take
as
much
pepper
as
he
pleased
pacheco
refused
to
accept
of
any
thing
saying
he
hoped
to
find
the
rajah
rich
and
prosperous
on
his
return
to
cochin
and
then
he
would
accept
a
reward
the
rajah
gave
pacheco
a
letter
for
the
king
of
portugal
in
which
he
set
forth
all
his
gallant
actions
during
the
war
strongly
recommending
him
to
his
majesties
favour
the
admiral
suarez
departed
from
cochin
on
the
december
taking
with
him
the
whole
of
his
fleet
even
those
captains
who
were
to
remain
in
india
his
intention
was
to
have
come
to
anchor
in
the
harbour
of
paniani
on
purpose
to
visit
the
rajah
of
tanor
but
from
foul
weather
and
bad
pilots
the
fleet
could
not
make
that
port
and
was
driven
to
calicut
and
pandarane
being
off
these
ports
and
with
a
scanty
wind
the
admiral
detached
raphael
and
perez
with
their
caravels
to
examine
if
there
were
any
ships
of
the
moors
at
anchor
while
on
this
service
ten
paraws
came
off
to
attack
them
and
an
engagement
ensued
on
the
rest
of
the
fleet
hearing
the
sound
of
the
ordnance
they
bore
up
as
close
to
the
wind
as
possible
and
came
to
anchor
in
a
council
of
war
it
was
resolved
to
attack
the
seventeen
ships
of
the
moors
which
lay
all
aground
and
as
the
ships
were
unable
to
get
near
them
because
they
lay
within
the
bar
the
attack
was
determined
to
be
made
by
the
boats
of
the
fleet
with
orders
to
set
the
moorish
ships
on
fire
this
being
resolved
upon
the
admiral
and
all
the
captains
of
the
fleet
embarked
in
the
boats
taking
with
them
all
the
soldiers
belonging
to
the
expedition
the
moorish
ships
were
all
drawn
on
the
beach
in
a
close
line
having
their
sterns
to
the
shore
and
were
well
armed
with
ordnance
and
had
many
soldiers
on
board
armed
with
bows
and
arrows
a
considerable
number
of
them
being
men
of
a
fair
complexion
besides
all
these
the
moors
had
two
pieces
of
ordnance
on
a
small
bulwark
or
redoubt
which
flanked
the
passage
of
the
bar
our
boats
seeing
all
these
formidable
preparations
returned
towards
the
fleet
whence
they
towed
several
caravels
within
the
bar
to
assist
the
boats
in
the
attack
after
a
severe
conflict
in
which
the
portuguese
had
men
killed
and
wounded
the
whole
seventeen
ships
of
the
moors
were
boarded
and
taken
with
the
loss
of
men
but
as
the
moorish
ships
were
all
aground
the
victors
were
under
the
necessity
to
burn
them
with
all
the
rich
merchandize
they
contained
owing
to
this
severe
loss
the
moors
deserted
the
city
of
calicut
which
by
the
cessation
of
trade
became
much
distressed
for
provisions
insomuch
that
most
of
its
inhabitants
withdrew
to
other
places
the
zamorin
was
so
much
humbled
by
this
succession
of
disastrous
events
that
he
remained
quiet
for
a
long
time
afterwards
the
particular
incidents
of
this
engagement
are
so
confusedly
related
in
lichefilds
translation
of
castaneda
as
to
baffle
every
attempt
to
reduce
them
into
intelligible
order
among
these
the
two
following
are
more
distinctly
told
tristan
de
la
silva
endeavoured
to
board
a
ship
which
appeared
to
be
the
admiral
of
which
the
captain
and
a
numerous
crew
were
turks
a
little
before
de
silva
got
up
to
this
ship
the
crew
had
fired
off
a
piece
of
ordnance
which
lay
on
the
upper
deck
and
which
by
its
recoil
broke
a
large
hole
in
the
side
of
the
ship
the
turks
were
so
intent
on
defending
themselves
against
the
portuguese
boats
that
they
neglected
to
barricade
this
hole
of
which
the
people
in
de
silvas
boat
took
advantage
to
get
on
board
alonzo
lopez
the
master
and
alvaro
lopez
one
of
the
kings
servants
now
of
santarem
being
the
first
who
entered
by
the
hole
a
desperate
conflict
ensued
on
deck
in
which
many
of
the
turks
were
slain
others
hid
themselves
below
the
hatches
and
others
leapt
into
the
water
most
of
whom
were
drowned
as
they
were
covered
with
shirts
of
mail
the
caravel
commanded
by
pedro
raphael
one
of
these
brought
within
the
bar
to
with
the
boats
was
struck
by
a
ball
from
the
battery
on
shore
which
killed
three
men
and
dangerously
wounded
other
ten
in
the
confusion
occasioned
by
this
accident
another
shot
killed
the
master
at
the
helm
and
the
caravel
drove
with
the
tide
of
flood
right
under
the
bows
of
a
large
moorish
ship
full
of
men
which
had
not
yet
been
attacked
by
the
boats
in
this
situation
a
great
number
of
the
enemy
boarded
the
caravel
used
our
men
very
the
caravel
afterwards
drifted
on
certain
rocks
where
she
remained
till
the
end
of
the
battle
the
situation
of
the
caravel
was
now
perceived
by
the
admiral
who
ordered
effectual
succour
to
be
sent
to
raphael
the
succours
boarded
the
caravel
which
was
quite
full
of
moors
whom
they
drove
out
with
great
slaughter
but
all
of
our
men
belonging
to
that
caravel
were
sore
hurt
on
the
next
day
being
the
first
of
january
the
admiral
went
with
the
fleet
to
cananor
to
take
in
the
rest
of
his
lading
he
was
here
informed
by
the
factor
of
the
humbled
situation
of
the
moors
from
whom
in
his
opinion
the
portuguese
had
no
longer
any
thing
to
fear
in
india
being
ready
to
depart
for
europe
the
admiral
made
an
oration
to
manual
telez
and
those
who
were
to
remain
with
him
in
india
giving
them
instructions
for
their
conduct
after
his
departure
and
as
the
enemy
was
so
greatly
humbled
he
considered
that
such
a
fleet
as
had
formerly
been
left
by
albuquerque
was
quite
sufficient
in
which
he
left
an
hundred
soldiers
indeed
the
zamorin
as
has
been
already
said
was
sick
of
the
war
and
remained
quiet
after
the
departure
of
the
admiral
departing
from
cananor
suarez
arrived
off
melinda
on
the
of
february
where
without
landing
himself
he
sent
antonio
de
saldanna
to
bring
away
the
rich
prizes
he
had
formerly
made
at
cape
guardafui
from
melinda
the
fleet
went
to
quiloa
on
purpose
to
enforce
the
payment
of
the
tribute
from
the
king
of
that
place
departing
from
thence
on
the
of
february
he
arrived
safe
at
lisbon
on
the
of
june
without
any
incident
worth
relating
carrying
with
him
two
ships
more
than
had
accompanied
him
to
india
all
laden
with
rich
commodities
and
was
received
by
the
king
don
manuel
with
great
honour
when
the
king
learnt
the
great
service
which
pacheco
had
performed
in
india
he
expressed
his
high
approbation
of
his
conduct
in
a
public
procession
the
king
went
in
all
the
splendour
usually
shewn
on
day
from
the
high
church
to
that
of
st
domingo
accompanied
by
duarte
pacheco
after
solemn
service
a
sermon
was
preached
by
don
diego
ortis
bishop
of
viseo
who
by
the
kings
command
gave
a
rehearsal
of
all
that
had
been
performed
by
pacheco
in
the
war
against
the
zamorin
on
the
same
day
a
solemn
festival
was
held
in
all
the
churches
of
portugal
and
algarve
the
king
sent
letters
on
the
occasion
to
the
pope
and
all
the
princes
of
christendom
announcing
all
these
notable
acts
and
victories
which
had
been
performed
in
the
indies
these
are
said
to
have
been
the
largest
ships
hitherto
built
in
portugal
and
to
have
carried
men
perhaps
soldiers
besides
their
ordinary
astl
i
the
turkish
empire
as
succeeding
that
of
the
romans
or
greeks
of
constantinople
is
still
called
in
the
east
it
will
be
afterwards
seen
that
these
romans
or
turks
made
some
powerful
efforts
to
drive
the
portuguese
from
india
as
greatly
injurious
to
the
indian
trade
with
europe
through
the
red
sea
and
e
this
expression
is
quite
inexplicable
unless
we
may
pick
out
very
darkly
that
it
belonged
to
the
calicut
confederacy
against
the
portuguese
yet
castaneda
or
his
imperfect
translator
lichefild
does
not
inform
us
whether
this
vessel
was
made
a
prize
lichefild
seems
almost
always
to
have
had
a
very
imperfect
knowledge
of
the
language
of
the
author
often
to
have
mistaken
his
meaning
or
expressed
it
with
great
obscurity
and
sometimes
writes
even
a
kind
of
jargon
by
endeavouring
to
translate
verbally
without
being
able
to
catch
an
idea
from
the
e
according
to
astley
from
de
fariz
only
ships
and
indeed
in
the
sequel
castaneda
only
mentions
ships
as
employed
on
the
present
occasion
and
three
others
that
were
drawn
up
on
e
at
the
commencement
of
this
section
castaneda
names
this
person
lope
mendez
de
vasconcelles
in
astley
i
he
is
called
manuel
tellez
e
in
lichefilds
translation
of
castaneda
this
date
is
made
the
september
which
is
an
obvious
e
by
some
strange
blunder
lichefild
says
they
came
to
but
from
all
the
circumstances
in
the
contexts
it
is
obvious
that
the
fleet
came
to
anchor
on
the
outside
of
the
bar
at
e
arabs
probably
whites
in
the
estimation
of
the
portuguese
as
compared
with
the
native
blacks
of
e
this
part
of
the
story
is
very
confusedly
translated
by
lichefild
according
to
his
relation
in
one
sense
the
admiral
alone
returned
in
his
boat
for
the
caravels
while
by
another
part
of
his
expressions
the
whole
boats
returned
for
the
admiral
and
the
e
according
to
astley
a
peace
was
concluded
between
the
portuguese
and
the
zamorin
immediately
after
the
victory
obtained
by
the
rajah
of
tanore
but
this
does
not
agree
with
the
circumstances
just
related
respecting
the
destruction
of
the
moorish
fleet
in
the
harbour
of
pandarane
which
would
hardly
have
been
done
during
a
time
of
peace
by
some
strange
typographical
mistake
lichefild
makes
this
date
both
in
the
text
and
in
a
marginal
note
thus
adding
no
less
than
twenty
years
to
the
true
chronology
in
astleys
collection
the
conclusion
of
this
voyage
is
dated
july
but
we
have
chosen
to
retain
the
regular
series
of
dates
as
given
by
castaneda
owing
to
the
mistake
in
lichefilds
translation
not
being
detected
till
a
part
of
this
chapter
was
printed
off
it

introduction
the
following
letters
bear
to
have
been
written
by
some
italian
public
agents
and
merchants
to
their
employers
and
friends
and
contain
a
curious
record
of
the
first
impressions
made
on
the
public
mind
by
the
wonderful
discoveries
which
navigation
was
then
opening
up
to
the
european
world
they
are
selected
from
the
a
work
which
was
published
by
early
in
the
sixteenth
century
according
to
de
la
richarderie
this
collection
was
formed
by
hans
heteirs
canon
of
strasburg
and
was
printed
under
the
care
of
simon
grynæus
by
isaac
hervag
in

at

in
we
learn
likewise
that
it
passed
rapidly
through
several
editions

been
reprinted
at

and
at

the
edition

its
principal
contents
besides
those
translated
for
the
present

are
the
voyages
of

the

the

which
will
be
attended
to
hereafter
and
the

of

which
have
been
already
given
at
full
length
from
a
better
source
the
language
of
the
is
perhaps
the
most
barbarous
latin
ever
composed
for
the
press
and
its
punctuation
is
so
enormously
incorrect
that
it
would
have
been
easier
understood
without
any
points
whatever
as
already
mentioned
the
edition
here
used
is
dated
in
the
year
little
more
than
fifty
years
after
the
discoveries
they
commemorate
and
the
letters
themselves
are
dated
in
and
immediately
after
the
return
of
the
earliest
of
the
portuguese
voyages
from
india
indeed
the
first
letter
seems
to
have
been
written
only
a
day
or
two
after
the
arrival
of
the
first
ship
belonging
to
cabrals
fleet
this
work
is
accompanied
by
a
very
curious
map
of
the
world
on
one
planisphere
much
elongated
to
the
east
and
west
which
may
be
considered
as
a
complete
picture
of
the
knowledge
then
acquired
of
the
cosmography
of
our
globe
the
first
meridian
is
placed
at
the
island
of
ferro
and
the
degrees
of
longitude
are
counted
from
thence
eastwards
all
round
the
world
so
that
ferro
is
in
long
and
in
every
part
of
the
world
the
outlines
are
grossly
incorrect
and
it
would
serve
no
purpose
to
give
an
extended
critical
view
of
this
map
yet
a
few
notices
respecting
it
may
gratify
curiosity
europe
is
singularly
incorrect

in
the
north
and
east
america
called
likewise
has
an
approximated
delineation
of
its
southern
division
stretching
far
to
the
south
as
if
the
cosmographer
had
received
some
tolerable
notices
of
brazil
cape
horn
and
the
coasts
of
peru
and
chili
but
instead
of
the
continent
of
north
america
the
island
of
cuba
is
delineated
in
a
north
and
south
direction
reaching
between
the
latitudes
of
and
north
leaving
a
small
strait
or
passage
between
its
southern
extremity
and
the
isthmus
of
darien
into
the
south
sea
about
twelve
degrees
west
from
cuba
the
island
of
zipangri
is
placed
and
at
least
twenty
degrees
east
from
cathay
or
china
at
sixteen
degrees
east
from
the
northern
end
of
cuba
a
large
island
is
placed
in
the
or
atlantic
called
which
the
cosmographer
seems
to
have
intended
to
represent
the
kingdom
of
mexico
recently
discovered
by
cortez
though
placed
almost
in
lat
perhaps
this
may
be
an
error
for
an
early
navigator
who
is
said
to
have
made
discoveries
on
the
eastern
coast
of
north
america
in
africa
there
is
an
approximation
towards
its
true
shape
yet
the
or
cape
verd
is
placed
to
the
north
of
the
river
senegal
instead
of
between
that
river
and
the
gambia
and
the
sources
of
the
nile
are
brought
down
to
lat
at
least
degrees
too
far
to
the
southwards
asia
with
india
and
china
are
too
much
distorted
for
criticism
calicut
is
placed
in
the
peninsula
of
cambaya
or
guzerate
the
and
or
malacca
are
separated
by
a
great
gulf
while
the
latter
is
placed
so
low
as
latitude
this
much
may
suffice
for
an
account
of
the
incorrect
yet
curious
specimen
of
cosmographical
knowledge
which
had
been
acquired
by
the
learned
in
europe
about
years
ago
to
these
four
letters
we
have
added
a
short
account
of
several
curious
circumstances
relative
to
the
trade
of
the
europeans
with
india
at
the
commencement
of
the
sixteenth
century
or
three
hundred
years
ago
which
though
not
very
accurately
expressed
contains
some
curious
information
novus

bibl
univ
des
voy
i
and
section
i
from
the
venetian
envoy
in
portugal
to
the
most
serene
prince
believing
that
your
highness
has
been
already
informed
by
the
most
excellent
legate
of
all
the
memorable
things
which
have
occurred
in
this
place
and
particularly
respecting
the
fleet
so
lately
dispatched
for
india
by
the
king
of
portugal
which
by
the
blessing
of
god
has
now
returned
with
the
loss
of
seven
ships
as
it
originally
consisted
of
fourteen
sail
seven
of
which
only
have
come
home
the
other
seven
having
been
wrecked
in
the
voyage
their
voyage
was
along
the
coasts
of
mauritania
and
getulia
to
cape
verd
anciently
called
off
which
the
islands
called
the
are
situated
from
thence
they
explored
lower
towards
the
east
beyond
which
the
ancients
never
penetrated
they
sailed
along
this
coast
of
ethiopia
to
a
line
corresponding
with
the
meridian
of
sicily
about
five
or
six
degrees
the
equinoctial
the
gold
mines
belonging
to
the
king
of
portugal
being
about
the
middle
of
that
coast
beyond
that
coast
of
the
gold
mines
and
nine
degrees
to
the
south
of
the
they
came
to
a
great
promontory
called
the
cape
of
good
hope
which
is
almost
miles
distant
from
our
country
from
thence
they
came
to
the
cape
anciently
called
which
was
considered
by
ptolemy
as
the
extremity
of
the
southern
regions
all
beyond
being
unknown
to
the
ancients
after
that
they
reached
the
country
of
the
now
called
or
sofala
which
our
ancestors
affirm
to
have
abounded
in
gold
infinitely
more
than
any
other
part
of
the
earth
stretching
from
sofala
across
the
they
came
into
the
indian
ocean
and
at
length
to
the
city
of
calicut
such
was
their
voyage
which
carefully
calculated
as
following
the
coasts
of
the
ocean
extends
to
the
prodigious
length
of
miles
but
which
if
the
lands
and
mountains
would
allow
in
a
direct
line
were
greatly
shorter
before
passing
the
cape
of
good
hope
in
consequence
of
being
forced
out
of
their
course
by
a
wind
they
discovered
a
new
country
to
which
they
gave
the
name
of
the
of
because
they
found
there
an
incredible
number
of
these
birds
of
many
beautiful
colours
some
of
them
a
cubit
and
a
half
in
length
and
more
we
have
seen
two
of
these
birds
and
can
vouch
for
the
truth
of
the
description
on
exploring
this
extensive
coast
the
navigators
believed
that
it
must
necessarily
belong
to
a
continent
as
they
sailed
along
it
for
the
space
of
miles
without
having
seen
either
extremity
its
coasts
are
inhabited
by
people
of
a
tolerably
handsome
appearance
who
go
quite
naked
in
this
voyage
they
lost
four
ships
two
others
were
sent
to
the
gold
mines
which
are
not
yet
returned
and
seven
only
reached
calicut
where
they
were
honourably
received
and
had
a
house
allotted
them
by
the
prince
and
there
they
brought
their
ships
to
anchor
soon
afterwards
there
assembled
many
boats
of
the
moors
and
other
neighbouring
people
and
some
frigates
belonging
to
the
great
sultan
all
the
people
belonging
to
which
conspired
together
against
the
christians
being
exceedingly
adverse
to
the
coming
of
the
christians
into
these
parts
lest
they
should
diminish
their
profits
they
insisted
therefore
to
have
their
ships
first
loaded
to
the
great
dissatisfaction
of
the
christians
who
immediately
complained
to
the
king
of
the
insolence
of
the
moors
but
soon
discovered
that
he
favoured
them
the
king
of
calicut
was
a
person
of
very
doubtful
faith
and
made
the
following
answer
that
it
did
not
seem
equitable
for
the
moors
to
be
permitted
to
finish
their
traffic
before
the
christians
and
gave
orders
accordingly
that
the
christians
might
carry
on
their
trade
the
moors
trangressed
this
decree
and
took
away
the
goods
of
the
christians
at
pleasure
upon
which
disputes
arose
between
the
christians
and
the
moors
in
which
the
whole
inhabitants
of
the
city
took
part
with
the
moors
whereupon
a
great
slaughter
was
made
of
the
christians
above
forty
of
them
being
slain
among
whom
was
their
principal
factor
when
endeavouring
to
escape
by
swimming
in
revenge
for
this
cruelty
the
christians
made
severe
reprisals
as
they
burnt
ten
ships
belonging
to
the
prefect
of
syria
that
is
the
sultan
and
destroyed
a
considerable
portion
of
the
city
by
means
of
their
and
many
houses
being
burnt
to
the
ground
as
they
are
covered
with
thatch
like
cottages
and
exceedingly
combustible
after
this
the
fleet
left
calicut
and
went
to
another
kingdom
named
cochin
about
forty
miles
distant
being
conducted
thither
by
a
jew
who
assumed
the
christian
faith
the
king
of
cochin
hated
the
king
of
calicut
exceedingly
and
on
that
account
received
the
christians
with
much
kindness
spices
are
in
greater
abundance
at
cochin
than
at
calicut
and
the
christians
carried
off
such
riches
from
cochin
as
i
dare
scarcely
venture
to
report
for
they
allege
to
have
purchased
a
of
cinnamon
which
is
a
considerable
measure
for
one
gold
ducat
the
king
of
cochin
gave
two
hostages
to
the
portuguese
in
assurance
of
their
safety
and
sent
even
ambassadors
to
the
king
of
portugal
in
the
mean
time
the
king
of
calicut
fitted
out
an
immense
fleet
against
the
christians
in
revenge
for
having
burnt
the
ships
in
his
harbour
this
fleet
exceeded
ships
and
carried
men
yet
on
account
of
a
north
wind
which
they
were
unable
to
contend
with
they
dared
not
to
attack
the
portuguese
ships
and
withdrew
from
cochin
as
their
great
numbers
were
considerably
formidable
the
portuguese
ships
went
to
a
certain
island
in
which
the
body
of
st
thomas
is
interred
the
lord
of
which
received
them
kindly
and
gave
them
some
relics
of
that
holy
person
in
token
of
friendship
he
even
offered
them
greater
quantities
of
spices
than
they
had
ever
seen
before
without
money
trusting
that
they
would
pay
for
them
on
their
return
from
europe
but
being
already
laden
the
portuguese
declined
this
friendly
offer
the
portuguese
fleet
employed
fourteen
months
in
this
voyage
and
returned
to
lisbon
in
spring
but
they
say
that
it
may
be
made
much
sooner
now
that
the
course
is
well
known
and
may
even
be
accomplished
in
ten
months
all
the
ships
that
reached
calicut
returned
except
one
which
was
lost
on
certain
rocks
but
the
crew
saved
which
ship
was
of
six
hundred
tons
burden
as
yet
only
one
caravel
has
come
into
port
but
the
rest
are
said
to
be
not
far
off
this
lately
arrived
ship
came
into
port
on
st
johns
day
may
at
which
time
i
happened
to
be
with
the
king
who
addressed
me
in
these
words
congratulate
me
good
sir
as
my
fleet
is
already
in
the
river
loaded
with
all
kinds
of
spices
i
received
the
news
joyfully
as
became
me
and
made
my
compliments
of
congratulation
to
the
king
the
tidings
were
welcomed
with
exceeding
joy
and
all
kind
of
festivity
with
the
sound
of
trumpets
cymbals
and
flutes
and
the
continual
firing
of
cannon
on
the
day
following
there
was
a
solemn
thanksgiving
at
which
all
the
people
assisted
when
i
again
waited
on
the
king
he
desired
me
to
apprize
your
serenity
of
his
good
fortune
saying
that
you
may
send
your
ships
hither
in
safety
to
purchase
his
spices
adding
that
he
should
take
such
measures
as
to
prevent
the
prefect
of
syria
that
is
the
sultan
from
procuring
spices
in
india
he
founds
this
hope
assuredly
on
the
success
which
his
fleet
had
lately
in
contending
with
the
numerous
vessels
of
the
moors
and
has
no
doubt
of
being
able
to
reduce
india
under
his
own
authority
the
ship
already
arrived
is
commanded
by
a
tuscan
named
bartholomew
a
native
of
florence
her
cargo
consists
of
or
quintals
of
pepper
cantari
of
cinnamon
cantari
of
lac
and
cantari
of
castor
and
other
perfumes
of
that
kind
they
have
no
cloves
or
ginger
having
been
prevented
by
the
moors
as
these
could
only
be
procured
at
calicut
neither
have
they
any
of
the
lesser
spices
they
had
purchased
many
pearls
of
different
sorts
which
were
all
lost
in
the
disturbances
at
calicut
in
which
many
of
their
men
and
much
riches
were
destroyed
i
must
not
omit
to
mention
that
there
have
lately
arrived
messengers
from
king
of
ethiopia
to
the
king
of
portugal
bringing
gifts
of
ivory
and
many
other
things
these
are
soon
to
return
in
two
ships
which
are
to
go
to
india
after
stopping
at
the
new
gold
mines
while
this
ship
which
has
first
arrived
was
on
its
voyage
home
it
met
two
ships
steering
their
course
from
the
gold
for
india
these
thinking
themselves
lost
or
that
they
would
be
plundered
by
the
christians
offered
to
pay
them
a
ransom
of
ducats
for
leave
to
continue
their
voyage
but
the
christians
though
tempted
by
so
much
gold
gave
these
people
many
gifts
and
permitted
them
to
continue
their
course
that
they
might
hereafter
be
allowed
a
free
trade
with
their
country
this
letter
is
dated
on
the
of
june
and
obviously
refers
to
the
voyage
of
cabral
who
had
returned
from
india
not
long
before
the
writer
is
described
as
a
native
of
crete
and
envoy
from
the
lords
of
venice
to
the
king
of
e
the
strange
geographical
language
here
used
is
inexplicable
probably
because
the
ideas
of
the
writer
were
confused
he
seems
to
mean
the
in
guinea
which
is
or
degrees
the
equator
or
to
the
north
but
is
at
least
west
from
the
meridian
of
sicily
meaning
the
tropic
of
capricorn
on
which
the
sun
is
during
our
winter
solstice
the
recession
of
the
coast
inwards
from
cape
delgado
to
melinda
which
may
be
called
the
bay
of
e
in
the
map
of
grynaeus
already
mentioned
this
or
land
of
parrots
is
placed
on
the
coast
of
africa
between
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
congo
yet
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
recent
discovery
of
brazil
on
the
coast
of
south
america
is
here
alluded
to
consequently
instead
of
the
or
wind
of
the
text
it
would
naturally
have
required
a
wind
to
force
the
portuguese
fleet
so
far
to
the
westward
of
its
intended
e
the
author
assuredly
uses
these
words
to
denominate
two
kinds
of
ordnance
or
cannon
then
used
in
the
portuguese
ships
of
e
by
the
sultan
or
prefect
of
syria
twice
so
designed
in
this
dispatch
is
evidently
meant
the
mameluk
sultan
of
egypt
but
who
was
soon
afterwards
defeated
and
slain
by
the
turkish
emperor
the
ineffectual
exertions
of
the
mameluks
and
turks
instigated
by
venice
to
obstruct
the
portuguese
trade
in
india
will
be
afterwards
e
it
is
difficult
to
say
what
is
meant
by
a
in
the
text
perhaps
a
quintal
or
pounds
the
castor
of
the
text
and
other
perfumes
may
mean
musk
civet
and
e
perhaps
the
king
of
congo
or
some
other
prince
of
the
west
coast
of
africa
is
here
alluded
to
or
perhaps
the
xeque
or
prince
of
the
moors
at
e
by
the
new
gold
mines
sofala
seems
indicated
as
contradistinguished
from
the
gold
mines
of
guinea
the
story
of
the
two
ships
on
their
voyage
to
india
from
sofala
obviously
alludes
to
the
guzerate
vessels
more
particularly
mentioned
already
in
the
voyage
of
cabral
section
ii
from
certain
merchants
and
bankers
of
spain
to
their
correspondents
in
the
cities
of
florence
and
venice
respecting
a
treaty
of
peace
and
league
between
the
kings
of
portugal
and
we
have
been
informed
by
those
who
were
on
board
of
the
fleet
which
sailed
from
lisbon
to
india
in
may
and
returned
on
the
december
that
the
king
of
calicut
has
concluded
a
peace
with
our
sovereign
on
the
following
conditions
as
a
compensation
for
the
slaughter
of
our
men
he
is
to
pay
of
pepper
equal
to
quintals
that
the
moors
shall
not
be
allowed
to
trade
there
from
any
place
whatever
excepting
only
those
who
are
natives
of
calicut
and
that
these
even
shall
not
be
permitted
to
trade
with
mecca
that
our
king
if
so
inclined
may
build
a
fort
at
calicut
and
shall
be
supplied
with
a
sufficient
quantity
of
stones
lime
and
timber
for
that
purpose
by
the
zamorin
paying
for
these
on
delivery
that
the
king
of
calicut
shall
aid
and
favour
the
portuguese
in
all
things
and
that
it
shall
be
competent
for
our
king
to
appoint
one
of
his
own
subjects
to
administer
justice
among
the
portuguese
resident
in
that
city
even
with
the
power
of
life
and
death
and
without
appeal
to
the
zamorin
that
when
any
of
our
people
shall
revolt
from
or
be
disobedient
to
our
commercial
agent
they
shall
immediately
be
delivered
up
to
be
judged
by
the
aforesaid
portuguese
consul
if
any
captive
moors
are
detained
they
shall
all
be
delivered
up
to
our
agent
that
the
two
milanese
lapidaries
who
had
gone
from
rome
to
india
and
who
there
acted
as
military
engineers
and
shipbuilders
in
the
european
fashion
to
the
disgrace
of
the
christian
profession
and
the
vast
injury
of
the
christians
should
be
delivered
up
in
chains
to
the
admiral
of
our
fleet
that
the
kings
or
rajahs
of
cochin
and
cananore
shall
be
included
in
this
treaty
as
mutually
sharing
all
danger
and
advantages
with
the
other
contracting
parties
so
that
if
any
one
shall
take
arms
against
any
of
the
parties
to
this
treaty
he
shall
be
declared
an
enemy
to
all
the
parties
hereby
confederated
if
any
of
the
parties
to
this
league
shall
act
contrary
to
its
stipulations
the
power
of
all
the
rest
shall
act
against
him
as
a
perfidious
person
a
traitor
and
an
enemy
to
good
faith
all
the
contracting
parties
using
their
utmost
to
preserve
the
present
peace
and
alliance
inviolate
while
the
portuguese
fleet
might
remain
in
the
harbour
of
calicut
all
other
ships
whatever
were
to
be
refused
access
at
least
until
after
ours
were
laden
but
when
there
were
sufficient
goods
for
all
who
wanted
them
then
all
ships
were
to
be
at
liberty
to
load
provided
always
that
the
accustomed
prices
should
not
be
augmented
and
expressly
that
the
profit
to
the
venders
should
never
exceed
per
cent
which
was
usual
in
that
port
these
are
the
conditions
of
peace
and
alliance
which
have
been
stipulated
to
the
great
honour
and
renown
of
our
sovereign
as
must
be
evident
to
every
one
as
henceforwards
he
may
not
only
be
accounted
sovereign
of
india
but
has
imposed
laws
on
turkey
and
the
prefect
of
syria
since
by
this
treaty
all
access
to
the
city
of
calicut
is
debarred
to
their
traders
we
do
not
even
doubt
that
in
four
years
from
hence
through
the
vigorous
measures
of
our
king
our
sailors
may
safely
navigate
to
constantinople
and
alexandria
the
present
most
celebrated
marts
of
eastern
commerce
and
shall
take
signal
vengeance
on
the
moors
by
whom
they
have
been
infamously
and
frequently
abused
for
this
purpose
a
fleet
of
twelve
sail
was
fitted
out
this
year
which
found
the
rajah
of
cochin
expelled
from
his
dominions
having
fled
for
refuge
from
the
hostilities
of
the
king
of
calicut
to
a
strong
place
in
a
certain
island
the
only
reason
he
could
assign
for
the
hostilities
of
the
zamorin
was
that
faithful
to
his
engagements
he
refused
to
deliver
our
people
to
the
king
of
calicut
and
chose
rather
to
live
in
exile
than
to
betray
his
trust
in
this
extremity
our
fleet
brought
opportune
aid
to
the
friendly
rajah
and
having
landed
troops
for
his
assistance
they
marched
boldly
against
the
perfidious
zamorin
routed
his
forces
with
great
slaughter
and
triumphantly
restored
the
rajah
of
cochin
to
his
dominions
this
kingdom
is
not
far
distant
from
the
straits
of
the
red
sea
where
they
have
erected
a
very
strong
fortress
and
are
building
another
in
the
mouth
of
the
bay
of
cochin
provided
with
all
kinds
of
warlike
artillery
by
which
to
repel
the
enemy
and
to
provide
a
safe
station
for
our
fleet
nor
shall
we
recede
from
thence
however
adverse
the
natives
may
be
to
our
remaining
and
when
the
same
shall
be
done
in
the
bay
of
calicut
it
will
not
then
be
difficult
to
defend
these
stations
and
the
adjoining
coasts
against
all
aggressors
our
ships
which
remained
in
these
seas
last
year
made
no
small
booty
as
they
took
one
morning
five
ships
bound
from
the
kingdom
of
cambaya
for
mecca
the
shrine
of
mahomet
in
which
they
found
or
quintals
of
clean
cloves
besides
a
large
quantity
of
the
same
spice
not
freed
from
the
husk
as
is
usual
with
us
these
ships
had
likewise
castor
and
other
perfumes
of
that
kind
sanders
wood
amber
purified
lac
and
excessively
fine
linen
and
a
large
sum
in
gold
and
silver
coin
insomuch
that
the
value
of
this
prize
exceeded
ducats
having
thus
informed
you
of
the
wealth
of
that
country
which
abounds
in
almost
every
thing
we
now
proceed
to
relate
that
two
of
our
ships
above
mentioned
have
been
cast
away
in
a
storm
near
the
mouth
of
the
red
sea
their
commander
vincentius
and
above
six
hundred
men
having
perished
but
the
other
two
were
saved
another
vessel
which
escaped
that
dreadful
tempest
was
soon
afterwards
dashed
to
pieces
against
a
rock
so
that
the
sea
was
covered
with
dead
bodies
and
with
rich
merchandize
of
all
kinds
thus
as
the
proverb
says
wealth
ill
acquired
is
ill
lost
of
all
these
ships
one
small
caravel
only
rode
out
the
storm
and
brought
intelligence
of
the
destruction
of
the
others
we
have
now
to
inform
you
that
our
king
has
given
permission
to
all
who
choose
to
proceed
to
india
and
to
carry
on
trade
providing
that
he
is
paid
a
quarter
part
of
all
returns
and
that
they
purchase
from
him
for
the
purpose
such
ships
as
he
thinks
proper
and
the
price
of
these
ships
must
be
paid
before
setting
out
on
the
voyage
because
considering
the
loss
of
ships
which
he
has
already
sustained
he
is
desirous
that
others
should
now
bear
the
risk
it
will
therefore
require
large
funds
to
embark
in
this
trade
so
that
we
hardly
believe
the
king
will
find
any
to
engage
on
these
conditions
but
of
this
we
shall
inform
you
from
time
to
time
as
it
may
occur
it
must
not
however
be
concealed
that
the
circumstances
of
this
trade
are
by
no
means
established
on
certain
principles
which
can
only
be
determined
by
future
events
a
portuguese
of
the
former
fleet
touched
at
a
certain
port
in
the
kingdom
of
sofala
and
visited
a
gold
mine
of
which
he
relates
wonderful
things
he
assured
us
that
a
ship
of
the
christians
had
been
there
and
speaks
of
incredible
quantities
of
gold
to
be
found
there
on
this
account
our
king
is
resolved
to
erect
a
strong
fort
at
that
place
to
keep
the
barbarians
under
subjection
and
to
keep
away
the
indians
and
the
inhabitants
of
cambaya
lest
they
should
make
themselves
masters
of
the
mine
he
will
therefore
immediately
seize
upon
this
mine
for
his
own
use
which
we
certainly
believe
to
have
been
the
mine
whence
solomon
derived
such
vast
riches
and
where
the
queen
of
sheba
dwelt
who
went
to
visit
solomon
as
related
in
holy
writ
these
things
are
of
such
importance
that
they
ought
not
to
be
concealed
from
you
and
our
king
is
to
be
deemed
happy
and
fortunate
because
he
hath
made
the
discovery
of
such
vast
riches
it
is
believed
by
many
that
they
will
soon
obtain
permission
from
the
king
to
go
to
india
paying
him
at
the
rate
of
per
cent
and
taking
his
ships
as
before
mentioned
it
appears
to
be
his
wish
that
the
merchants
should
send
out
their
own
factors
or
supercargoes
with
the
care
of
their
goods
but
without
any
authority
as
he
wishes
to
rule
in
all
things
and
that
every
thing
may
be
directed
by
his
officers
even
the
expences
of
the
merchants
the
trade
in
spiceries
is
to
remain
exclusively
in
the
viceroy
and
is
not
to
be
permitted
to
the
merchants
for
which
reason
it
is
not
believed
that
this
indian
trade
will
be
very
profitable
but
we
shall
give
you
due
information
of
all
these
things
as
they
occur
we
have
formerly
written
you
that
cairo
failed
in
its
commercial
prosperity
from
the
very
same
cause
and
if
this
great
eastern
trade
shall
be
appropriated
by
the
king
it
will
certainly
occasion
a
babylonian
confusion
in
the
state
and
very
deservedly
for
at
cairo
the
moors
were
in
use
to
maltreat
the
christians
exceedingly
and
they
are
now
perhaps
suffering
for
that
error
as
they
will
not
any
longer
be
allowed
to
carry
away
any
kind
of
spices
or
jewels
of
all
kinds
or
pearls
and
other
valuable
commodities
as
by
means
of
the
portuguese
forts
they
will
in
future
be
debarred
from
trading
to
calicut
and
sofala
for
all
which
you
will
be
thankful
to
god
concerning
the
gold
mine
of
sofala
which
we
mentioned
before
and
of
which
such
wonderful
things
are
told
it
is
said
our
king
will
be
the
sole
proprietor
in
two
years
which
must
prove
of
vast
importance
as
from
that
place
which
is
now
possessed
by
the
idolaters
all
india
and
persia
used
to
procure
the
whole
of
their
gold
although
the
mouth
of
the
bay
is
under
the
dominion
of
a
king
of
the
chaldeans
at
which
place
the
trade
is
carried
on
with
the
idolaters
by
the
moors
who
bring
yearly
their
ships
from
cambaya
laden
with
articles
which
they
barter
for
gold
these
goods
are
coarse
cotton
cloths
silks
of
various
fashions
and
many
colours
but
chiefly
of
the
turkish
fabric
the
king
of
quiloa
an
island
about
sixty
leagues
from
sofala
it
is
said
will
have
to
quit
that
place
from
fear
of
the
idolaters
at
quiloa
all
ships
going
to
sofala
have
to
stop
and
pay
tribute
before
going
to
the
mine
of
sofala
when
they
get
to
sofala
they
have
to
remain
there
six
or
eight
months
before
completing
their
affairs
carrying
from
thence
gold
ivory
and
wax
all
of
the
best
kind
after
this
they
have
again
to
touch
at
quiloa
and
to
pay
a
tax
for
their
gold
thence
they
go
to
cambaya
or
mecca
in
our
ships
there
are
twelve
or
fifteen
agents
of
the
king
of
quiloa
who
pays
a
tribute
yearly
to
our
king
of
each
of
which
metigals
is
worth
ducats
or
in
all
ducats
that
king
depends
so
entirely
on
the
king
of
portugal
that
our
king
may
dethrone
him
whenever
be
pleases
to
send
there
a
force
of
men
which
would
oblige
the
king
of
quiloa
to
run
away
and
it
is
believed
this
will
be
done
shortly
the
thing
being
so
easy
and
by
this
means
an
yearly
revenue
of
ducats
would
be
secured
if
you
have
properly
considered
what
those
ships
may
bring
which
are
daily
expected
you
will
find
that
they
will
at
least
import
about
quintals
of
all
kinds
of
spice
and
we
shall
ship
for
you
of
all
these
using
our
endeavours
that
you
may
never
be
in
want
of
them
even
after
the
before
mentioned
treaty
with
the
king
of
calicut
no
small
risk
still
remains
to
those
who
navigate
to
the
indies
on
account
of
a
certain
archipelago
containing
about
islands
and
owing
to
the
narrowness
of
a
certain
strait
which
is
scarcely
navigable
we
shall
persist
notwithstanding
as
by
custom
and
experience
these
dangers
will
become
of
no
consequence
at
length
we
expect
to
have
the
glory
of
having
discovered
almost
the
whole
of
the
world
and
those
parts
of
it
especially
to
which
the
ancients
never
penetrated
it
only
remains
for
us
to
go
to
the
island
of
taprobana
or
ceylon
which
according
to
pliny
is
exceedingly
rich
in
gold
gems
and
ivory
thus
by
our
anxious
endeavours
we
shall
lay
open
the
whole
of
india
to
our
trade
by
letters
from
thence
it
appears
that
our
merchandize
is
not
much
valued
in
these
parts
and
that
ought
to
be
sent
out
if
we
wish
to
have
our
affairs
speedily
conducted
as
other
goods
remain
long
in
hand
for
the
indians
purposely
procrastinate
that
they
may
beat
down
the
value
of
our
commodities
the
indians
give
a
high
price
for
brass
and
alum
but
this
last
must
be
white
not
red
and
in
large
pieces
as
they
despise
the
small
they
do
not
care
for
coral
unless
large
and
finely
wrought
which
otherwise
bears
no
value
lead
is
valued
if
in
large
bars
quicksilver
and
amber
are
in
no
request
wrought
brass
bears
a
low
price
as
it
is
always
manufactured
over
again
in
their
own
fashion
so
that
the
cost
of
manufacturing
in
europe
would
be
thrown
away
all
other
goods
besides
these
mentioned
are
in
no
demand
and
will
therefore
bring
small
profit
this
letter
has
no
date
but
must
have
been
very
early
in
the
sixteenth
century
probably
in
from
the
circumstance
to
which
it
alludes
at
its
commencement
although
said
to
be
from
there
is
every
reason
to
suppose
it
was
written
from
lisbon
as
we
find
portugal
frequently
considered
as
spain
which
it
actually
is
in
the
most
extensive
geographical
e
this
as
formerly
observed
alludes
to
the
mameluk
sultan
of
egypt
through
whose
dominions
the
trade
between
india
and
europe
was
entirely
carried
on
before
this
era
this
treaty
of
peace
and
alliance
between
portugal
and
calicut
may
possibly
have
been
proposed
at
this
period
but
certainly
was
not
then
agreed
to
as
there
were
long
wars
with
the
zamorin
before
his
power
was
reduced
under
the
influence
and
dominion
of
the
e
this
is
rather
an
anachronism
as
at
this
period
the
portuguese
had
no
fortress
on
the
red
sea
the
of
the
text
was
probably
musk
and
its
ambergris
this
alludes
to
the
misfortune
of
vincente
sodre
and
his
squadron
already
more
distinctly
related
in
the
preceding
e
the
expression
of
the
original
centenario
lucro
is
not
easily
understood
it
is
here
translated
a
quarter
part
of
the
return
cargo
conformably
with
the
regulations
of
don
henry
for
the
trade
of
guinea
as
already
stated
in
vol
from
which
the
present
were
probably
e
it
is
difficult
to
guess
what
bay
and
who
may
be
the
king
of
the
chaldeans
here
alluded
to
perhaps
the
town
of
sofala
the
emporium
of
the
gold
trade
of
eastern
africa
which
was
ruled
by
an
arabian
prince
or
sheik
by
the
idolaters
in
the
text
are
apparently
meant
the
negroes
of
the
interior
where
the
gold
came
from
by
way
of
e
this
alludes
to
the
maldives
and
e
section
iii
from
peter
pasquali
orator
of
the
venetian
republic
at
the
court
of
the
king
of
portugal
to
his
brothers
dwelling
in
beloved
brothers
i
formerly
wrote
you
by
peter
verzo
the
carrier
informing
you
of
all
the
news
of
this
place
and
now
write
again
by
bartholomew
marquesi
the
uncle
of
dominic
benedicto
of
florence
that
you
may
be
informed
of
our
affairs
and
may
be
assured
of
our
desire
to
write
whenever
an
opportunity
offers
know
therefore
that
the
vessel
which
was
sent
out
last
year
towards
the
north
by
the
king
of
portugal
under
the
command
of
caspar
corterato
has
now
returned
he
reports
having
discovered
a
continent
about
miles
from
hence
in
a
direction
between
the
and
the
west
hitherto
utterly
unknown
he
is
likewise
said
to
have
sailed
almost
miles
along
its
coast
without
finding
any
end
on
which
account
it
is
considered
to
be
a
continent
and
not
an
island
and
its
coast
appears
to
join
with
another
land
formerly
discovered
almost
under
the
very
north
but
the
vessel
was
unable
to
proceed
so
far
on
account
of
the
sea
being
frozen
and
from
excessive
falls
of
snow
it
is
concluded
from
the
number
of
rivers
which
descend
from
the
snowy
mountains
that
this
land
must
be
a
continent
as
no
island
could
possibly
supply
so
many
rivers
the
land
is
said
to
be
well
cultivated
the
houses
of
the
inhabitants
are
constructed
of
wood
covered
with
hides
or
the
skins
of
fish
the
vessel
now
arrived
has
brought
over
seven
of
the
natives
of
both
sexes
and
the
other
ship
which
is
hourly
expected
is
said
to
have
fifty
in
stature
colour
appearance
and
dress
these
people
are
very
like
the
they
are
clothed
in
the
skins
of
fish
and
otters
and
other
hairy
skins
like
those
of
wolves
wearing
the
fur
side
inwards
in
winter
as
we
do
and
outwards
in
summer
but
these
are
not
fashioned
or
sewed
together
being
used
in
their
natural
forms
these
are
principally
worn
on
their
arms
and
shoulders
and
their
loins
are
girded
with
many
cords
made
of
sinews
they
appear
a
savage
people
yet
not
impudent
and
are
well
made
in
all
their
limbs
their
faces
are
punctured
with
many
marks
like
the
indians
having
six
or
eight
punctured
lines
more
or
less
according
to
their
fancies
in
which
they
seem
to
take
great
delight
they
have
a
language
which
is
not
understood
by
any
one
although
interpreters
of
almost
every
tongue
have
been
tried
their
country
is
destitute
of
iron
yet
they
have
swords
edged
with
sharp
stones
and
their
arrows
are
pointed
by
the
same
means
and
are
sharper
even
than
ours
our
people
brought
from
thence
part
of
a
broken
sword
with
gilded
ornaments
which
seemed
of
italian
manufacture
a
certain
boy
is
said
to
have
been
seen
in
that
country
having
two
silver
balls
banging
from
his
ears
which
certainly
appeared
to
be
engraved
after
our
manner
on
the
whole
it
may
be
concluded
that
this
country
is
a
continent
not
an
island
and
that
is
a
new
discovery
for
if
any
ships
had
ever
been
here
before
we
should
assuredly
have
heard
something
respecting
it
the
coast
abounds
in
fish
particularly
salmon
herrings
and
many
others
of
that
kind
there
are
forests
which
abound
in
all
kinds
of
trees
so
that
ships
with
masts
yards
benches
and
all
things
conformable
on
this
account
the
king
of
portugal
has
resolved
to
convert
this
discovery
to
profit
both
on
account
of
the
abundance
of
wood
which
is
fit
for
many
purposes
and
because
the
natives
being
accustomed
to
labour
may
become
very
useful
and
indeed
i
have
never
seen
better
slaves
i
have
deemed
it
consistent
with
our
friendship
to
acquaint
you
with
these
things
and
when
the
other
vessel
arrives
which
is
daily
expected
i
shall
communicate
other
particulars
the
fleet
has
sailed
for
calicut
and
the
king
has
ordered
that
it
shall
seize
the
fleet
of
mecca
that
the
soldan
of
syria
may
neither
have
access
there
in
future
nor
may
export
any
more
spices
the
king
of
portugal
is
satisfied
that
every
thing
shall
go
according
to
his
wishes
in
this
respect
and
the
court
and
all
the
nation
are
of
the
same
opinion
should
this
purpose
succeed
it
is
incredible
how
abundant
this
kingdom
must
soon
become
in
all
kinds
of
riches
and
merchandize
and
from
hence
the
ships
of
venice
in
particular
will
have
to
bring
their
accustomed
articles
of
trade
to
us
truly
who
formerly
sustained
this
branch
of
commerce
entirely
by
our
own
resources
this
decree
will
be
injurious
unless
he
shew
us
favour
this
letter
is
dated
october
it
is
probable
that
pasquali
would
hardly
write
this
the
court
of
portugal
to
his
brothers
in
it
being
more
likely
that
they
resided
in
e
the
discovery
here
referred
to
seems
to
have
been
the
coast
of
labradore
and
the
other
country
under
the
north
may
possibly
be
greenland
this
voyage
was
probably
in
quest
of
a
passage
to
e
in
this
passage
we
surely
ought
to
read
may
be
e
section
iv
from
francis
sagitta
of
cremona
from
lisbon
directed
to
the
venetian
orator
peter
pasquali
residing
at
the
court
of
most
excellent
orator
in
two
former
letters
i
have
promised
to
omit
no
opportunity
of
informing
your
excellency
what
kind
of
merchandize
might
be
brought
in
four
vessels
which
were
expected
daily
from
india
they
are
now
arrived
and
i
shall
truly
state
all
the
merchandize
which
they
have
brought
which
is
as
follows
one
thousand
quintals
of
pepper
quintals
of
cinnamon
about
fifty
quintals
of
ginger
fifty
quintals
of
lac
and
as
much
cotton
as
may
be
bought
for
ducats
the
reason
assigned
for
having
brought
so
small
a
quantity
of
spice
is
that
they
agreed
among
themselves
after
sailing
from
hence
that
two
of
the
ships
should
steer
for
the
gold
mine
and
the
other
two
for
calicut
on
this
account
each
took
only
such
goods
as
it
was
thought
would
be
valued
in
the
ports
to
which
they
were
bound
but
when
these
ships
came
to
calicut
they
were
not
allowed
to
trade
and
were
obliged
to
go
to
other
places
on
going
to
cananore
they
there
learnt
what
had
been
done
by
peter
aliaris
the
factor
at
cochin
for
the
king
the
king
or
rajah
of
cananore
received
our
people
honourably
and
offered
to
supply
our
commanders
gratuitously
with
all
kinds
of
spices
but
thanking
him
gratefully
for
this
kindness
he
declined
the
offer
saying
that
he
must
go
in
the
first
place
to
the
kings
factor
at
cochin
and
would
then
return
and
accept
his
spices
on
credit
setting
out
therefore
for
cochin
he
transacted
business
with
the
royal
agent
peter
aliaris
but
as
the
ships
did
not
bring
money
for
their
purchases
and
as
the
goods
they
brought
were
in
small
request
and
they
could
not
therefore
succeed
in
making
purchases
the
commander
resolved
to
return
to
cananore
where
the
rajah
had
expressed
so
much
good
will
for
the
portuguese
and
where
he
bartered
his
merchandize
for
spices
at
a
good
profit
he
here
left
three
persons
with
the
ships
factor
and
a
clerk
because
the
rajah
had
advanced
money
on
credit
for
the
spices
that
they
might
not
appear
to
have
cheated
the
rajah
yet
after
all
the
ships
had
to
come
away
only
half
loaded
because
they
had
not
taken
out
money
for
their
purchases
and
their
goods
were
in
no
request
the
conclusion
from
this
is
evident
that
the
indians
have
no
demand
for
our
goods
and
that
money
alone
is
especially
desired
by
them
and
of
which
they
are
in
great
need
it
has
been
reported
since
that
these
kings
of
the
indies
gave
as
much
merchandize
to
our
admiral
without
price
as
would
load
four
ships
out
of
fear
of
the
christians
especially
the
king
of
calicut
who
has
been
told
by
his
soothsayers
to
beware
of
the
ensuing
year
as
the
stars
threaten
him
with
a
great
slaughter
of
his
men
by
the
christians
and
that
his
kingdom
even
would
be
deserted
owing
to
dread
of
that
people
we
have
this
intelligence
from
three
men
who
escaped
from
the
battle
at
with
the
barbarians
the
same
thing
is
reported
by
a
native
of
bergamo
who
had
dwelt
years
at
calicut
which
is
likewise
confirmed
by
a
native
of
valentia
who
had
sojourned
there
six
years
in
the
meantime
the
king
of
calicut
fitted
out
a
large
fleet
to
attack
our
ships
at
cananore
but
they
immediately
sought
for
safety
by
setting
sail
on
this
account
the
king
of
portugal
has
ordered
eight
or
ten
ships
of
burthen
to
be
fitted
out
by
next
january
of
which
seven
are
already
built
two
ships
have
been
sent
out
this
summer
one
of
which
is
of
tons
burthen
and
the
other
of
there
is
a
third
in
the
port
of
lisbon
of
tons
two
others
at
madeira
one
of
and
the
other
of
tons
another
is
fitting
out
at
setubal
carrying
above
tons
besides
these
six
a
caravel
is
to
be
added
which
lately
came
from
the
island
of
chio
all
of
which
are
entirely
at
the
royal
charges
and
two
are
to
be
fitted
out
by
the
king
for
certain
merchants
one
of
tons
and
the
other
of
it
is
agreed
between
these
merchants
and
the
king
that
the
king
shall
be
at
the
sole
expence
of
the
voyage
and
payment
of
the
sailors
as
in
his
service
that
the
merchants
shall
carry
out
as
much
money
as
may
suffice
for
all
their
purchases
and
on
the
return
of
the
ships
half
of
the
goods
shall
belong
to
the
king
and
the
merchants
shall
be
at
liberty
to
sell
the
other
half
for
their
own
behoof
it
appears
evident
to
us
that
this
mode
of
conducting
business
will
be
greatly
more
to
the
benefit
of
the
merchants
than
going
entirely
at
their
own
risk
as
has
been
done
hitherto
so
that
the
king
will
probably
find
abundance
of
people
willing
to
trade
to
india
on
these
conditions
we
have
accordingly
a
share
in
these
two
ships
but
of
the
event
god
alone
can
judge
this
letter
is
dated
september
and
by
it
pascquali
appears
to
have
gone
from
portugal
into
spain
section
the

and
money
of
calicut
and
of
the
places
whence
they
procure
their
having
already
treated
concerning
the
articles
of
commerce
of
all
kinds
in
the
indies
it
is
proper
to
give
some
account
of
the
prices
and
weights
of
these
in
the
city
of
calicut
a

this
section
is
taken
from
the
of
grynaeus

in
which
it
forms
part
of
the
navigations
from
lisbon
to
calicut
attributed
to
the
pen
of
aloysius
cadamosto
the
information
it
contains
respecting
the
principal
commodities
then
brought
from
india
to
europe
and
their
prices
is
curious
yet
there
is
some
reason
to
suspect
that
the
author
or
editor
rather
has
sometimes
interchanged
the
bahar
and
the
faracula
or
its
twentieth
part
in
the
weights
of
the
commodities
several
of
the
names
of
things
and
places
are
unintelligible
probably
from
corrupt
e
meluza
may
possibly
be
the
city
of
malacca
then
a
great
emporium
of
indian
trade
but
it
is
impossible
to
reconcile
or
explain
meluza
in
cananore
twelve
leagues
from
calicut
and
meluza
leagues
from
e
this
may
possibly
refer
to
the
island
of
ramisseram
in
the
straits
of
manaar
between
ceylon
and
the
coromandel
coast
near
which
the
famous
pearl
fishery
is
still
carried
e
evidently
cambaya
or
e
probably
cassia
lignea
or
in
rolled
up
bark
like
twigs
to
distinguish
it
from
the
drug
called
cassia
e
perhaps
the
coast
of
habesh
on
the
red
e
probably
a
typographical
error
for

alluding
to
some
part

perhaps
zedoary
repeated
afterwards
under
