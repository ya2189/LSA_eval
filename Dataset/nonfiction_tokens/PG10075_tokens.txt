preface
the
following
account
of
the
life
of
venture
is
a
relation
of
simple
facts
in
which
nothing
is
in
substance
to
what
he
relates
himself
many
other
interesting
and
curious
passages
of
his
life
might
have
been
inserted
but
on
account
of
the
bulk
to
which
they
must
necessarily
have
swelled
this
narrative
they
were
omitted
if
any
should
suspect
the
truth
of
what
is
here
related
they
are
referred
to
people
now
living
who
are
acquainted
with
most
of
the
facts
mentioned
in
this
narrative
the
reader
is
here
presented
with
an
account
not
of
a
renowned
politician
or
warrior
but
of
an
untutored
african
slave
brought
into
this
christian
country
at
eight
years
of
age
wholly
destitute
of
all
education
but
what
he
received
in
common
with
other
domesticated
animals
enjoying
no
advantages
that
could
lead
him
to
suppose
himself
superior
to
the
beasts
his
fellow
servants
and
if
he
shall
enjoy
no
other
advantage
from
perusing
this
narrative
he
may
experience
those
sensations
of
shame
and
indignation
that
will
prove
him
to
be
not
wholly
destitute
of
every
noble
and
generous
feeling
the
subject
of
the
following
pages
had
he
received
only
a
common
education
might
have
been
a
man
of
high
respectability
and
usefulness
and
had
his
education
been
suited
to
his
genius
he
might
have
been
an
ornament
and
an
honor
to
human
nature
it
may
perhaps
not
be
unpleasing
to
see
the
efforts
of
a
great
mind
wholly
uncultivated
enfeebled
and
depressed
by
slavery
and
struggling
under
every
disadvantage
the
reader
may
here
see
a
franklin
and
a
washington
in
a
state
of
nature
or
rather
in
a
state
of
slavery
destitute
as
he
is
of
all
education
he
still
exhibits
striking
traces
of
native
ingenuity
and
good
sense
this
narrative
exhibits
a
pattern
of
honesty
prudence
and
industry
to
people
of
his
own
colour
and
perhaps
some
white
people
would
not
find
themselves
degraded
by
imitating
such
an
example
the
following
account
is
published
in
compliance
with
the
earnest
desire
of
the
subject
of
it
and
likewise
a
number
of
respectable
persons
who
are
acquainted
with
him
chapter
i
an
account
of
his
life
from
his
birth
to
the
time
of
his
leaving
his
native
i
was
born
at
dukandarra
in
guinea
about
the
year
my
name
was
saungm
furro
prince
of
the
tribe
of
dukandarra
my
father
had
three
wives
polygamy
was
not
uncommon
in
that
country
especially
among
the
rich
as
every
man
was
allowed
to
keep
as
many
wives
as
he
could
maintain
by
his
first
wife
he
had
three
children
the
eldest
of
them
was
myself
named
by
my
father
broteer
the
other
two
were
named
cundazo
and
soozaduka
my
father
had
two
children
by
his
second
wife
and
one
by
his
third
i
descended
from
a
very
large
tall
and
stout
race
of
beings
much
larger
than
the
generality
of
people
in
other
parts
of
the
globe
being
commonly
considerably
above
six
feet
in
height
and
in
every
way
well
proportioned
the
first
thing
worthy
of
notice
which
i
remember
was
a
contention
between
my
father
and
mother
on
account
of
my
father
marrying
his
third
wife
without
the
consent
of
his
first
and
eldest
which
was
contrary
to
the
custom
generally
observed
among
my
countrymen
in
consequence
of
this
rupture
my
mother
left
her
husband
and
country
and
travelled
away
with
her
three
children
to
the
eastward
i
was
then
five
years
old
she
took
not
the
least
sustenance
along
with
her
to
support
either
herself
or
children
i
was
able
to
travel
along
by
her
side
the
other
two
of
her
offspring
she
carried
one
on
her
back
and
the
other
being
a
sucking
child
in
her
arms
when
we
became
hungry
my
mother
used
to
set
us
down
on
the
ground
and
gather
some
of
the
fruits
which
grew
spontaneously
in
that
climate
these
served
us
for
food
on
the
way
at
night
we
all
lay
down
together
in
the
most
secure
place
we
could
find
and
reposed
ourselves
until
morning
though
there
were
many
noxious
animals
there
yet
so
kind
was
our
almighty
protector
that
none
of
them
were
ever
permitted
to
hurt
or
molest
us
thus
we
went
on
our
journey
until
the
second
day
after
our
departure
from
dukandarra
when
we
came
to
the
entrance
of
a
great
desert
during
our
travel
in
that
we
were
often
affrighted
with
the
doleful
howlings
and
yellings
of
wolves
lions
and
other
animals
after
five
days
travel
we
came
to
the
end
of
this
desert
and
immediately
entered
into
a
beautiful
and
extensive
interval
country
here
my
mother
was
pleased
to
stop
and
seek
a
refuge
for
me
she
left
me
at
the
house
of
a
very
rich
farmer
i
was
then
i
should
judge
not
less
than
one
hundred
forty
miles
from
my
native
place
separated
from
all
my
relations
and
acquaintance
at
this
place
my
mother
took
her
farewell
of
me
and
set
out
for
her
own
country
my
new
guardian
as
i
shall
call
the
man
with
whom
i
was
left
put
me
into
the
business
of
tending
sheep
immediately
after
i
was
left
with
him
the
flock
which
i
kept
with
the
assistance
of
a
boy
consisted
of
about
forty
we
drove
them
every
morning
between
two
and
three
miles
to
pasture
into
the
wide
and
delightful
plains
when
night
drew
on
we
drove
them
home
and
secured
them
in
the
cote
in
this
round
i
continued
during
my
stay
there
one
incident
that
befel
me
when
i
was
driving
my
flock
from
pasture
was
so
dreadful
to
me
at
that
age
and
is
to
this
time
fresh
in
my
memory
that
i
can
not
help
noticing
it
in
this
place
two
large
dogs
sallied
out
of
a
certain
house
and
set
upon
me
one
of
them
took
me
by
the
arm
and
the
other
by
the
thigh
and
before
their
master
could
come
and
relieve
me
they
lacerated
my
flesh
to
such
a
degree
that
the
scars
are
very
visible
to
the
present
day
my
master
was
immediately
sent
for
he
came
and
carried
me
home
as
i
was
unable
to
go
myself
on
account
of
my
wounds
nothing
remarkable
happened
afterwards
until
my
father
sent
for
me
to
return
home
before
i
dismiss
this
country
i
must
just
inform
my
reader
what
i
remember
concerning
this
place
a
large
river
runs
through
this
country
in
a
westerly
course
the
land
for
a
great
way
on
each
side
is
flat
and
level
hedged
in
by
a
considerable
rise
of
the
country
at
a
great
distance
from
it
it
scarce
ever
rains
there
yet
the
land
is
fertile
great
dews
fall
in
the
night
which
refresh
the
soil
about
the
latter
end
of
june
or
first
of
july
the
river
begins
to
rise
and
gradually
increases
until
it
has
inundated
the
country
for
a
great
distance
to
a
height
of
seven
or
eight
feet
this
brings
on
a
slime
which
enriches
the
land
surprisingly
when
the
river
has
subsided
the
natives
begin
to
sow
and
plant
and
the
vegetation
is
exceedingly
rapid
near
this
rich
river
my
guardian
land
lay
he
possessed
i
can
not
tell
exactly
how
much
yet
this
i
am
certain
of
respecting
it
that
he
owned
an
immense
tract
he
possessed
likewise
a
great
many
cattle
and
goats
during
my
stay
with
him
i
was
kindly
used
and
with
as
much
tenderness
for
what
i
saw
as
his
only
son
although
i
was
an
entire
stranger
to
him
remote
from
friends
and
relations
the
principal
occupation
of
the
inhabitants
there
were
the
cultivation
of
the
soil
and
the
care
of
their
flocks
they
were
a
people
pretty
similar
in
every
respect
to
that
of
mine
except
in
their
persons
which
were
not
so
tall
and
stout
they
appeared
to
be
very
kind
and
friendly
i
will
now
return
to
my
departure
from
that
place
my
father
sent
a
man
and
horse
after
me
after
settling
with
my
guardian
for
keeping
me
he
took
me
away
and
went
for
home
it
was
then
about
one
year
since
my
mother
brought
me
here
nothing
remarkable
occured
to
us
on
our
journey
until
we
arrived
safe
home
i
found
then
that
the
difference
between
my
parents
had
been
made
up
previous
to
their
sending
for
me
on
my
return
i
was
received
both
by
my
father
and
mother
with
great
joy
and
affection
and
was
once
more
restored
to
my
paternal
dwelling
in
peace
and
happiness
i
was
then
about
six
years
old
not
more
than
six
weeks
had
passed
after
my
return
before
a
message
was
brought
by
an
inhabitant
of
the
place
where
i
lived
the
preceding
year
to
my
father
that
that
place
had
been
invaded
by
a
numerous
army
from
a
nation
not
far
distant
furnished
with
musical
instruments
and
all
kinds
of
arms
then
in
use
that
they
were
instigated
by
some
white
nation
who
equipped
and
sent
them
to
subdue
and
possess
the
country
that
his
nation
had
made
no
preparation
for
war
having
been
for
a
long
time
in
profound
peace
that
they
could
not
defend
themselves
against
such
a
formidable
train
of
invaders
and
must
therefore
necessarily
evacuate
their
lands
to
the
fierce
enemy
and
fly
to
the
protection
of
some
chief
and
that
if
he
would
permit
them
they
should
come
under
his
rule
and
protection
when
they
had
to
retreat
from
their
own
possessions
he
was
a
kind
and
merciful
prince
and
therefore
consented
to
these
proposals
he
had
scarcely
returned
to
his
nation
with
the
message
before
the
whole
of
his
people
were
obliged
to
retreat
from
their
country
and
come
to
my
fathers
dominions
he
gave
them
every
privilege
and
all
the
protection
his
government
could
afford
but
they
had
not
been
there
longer
than
four
days
before
news
came
to
them
that
the
invaders
had
laid
waste
their
country
and
were
coming
speedily
to
destroy
them
in
my
territories
this
affrighted
them
and
therefore
they
immediately
pushed
off
to
the
southward
into
the
unknown
countries
there
and
were
never
more
heard
of
two
days
after
their
retreat
the
report
turned
out
to
be
but
too
true
a
detachment
of
the
enemy
came
to
my
father
and
informed
him
that
the
whole
army
was
encamped
not
far
out
of
his
dominions
and
would
invade
the
territory
and
deprive
his
people
of
their
liberties
and
rights
if
he
did
not
comply
with
the
following
terms
these
were
to
pay
them
a
large
sum
of
money
three
hundred
fat
cattle
and
a
great
number
of
goats
sheep
asses
my
father
told
the
messenger
that
he
would
comply
rather
than
that
his
subjects
should
be
deprived
of
their
rights
and
privileges
which
he
was
not
then
in
circumstances
to
defend
from
so
sudden
an
invasion
upon
turning
out
those
articles
the
enemy
pledged
their
faith
and
honor
that
they
would
not
attack
him
on
these
he
relied
and
therefore
thought
it
unnecessary
to
be
on
his
guard
against
the
enemy
but
their
pledges
of
faith
and
honor
proved
no
better
than
those
of
other
unprincipled
hostile
nations
for
a
few
days
after
a
certain
relation
of
the
king
came
and
informed
him
that
the
enemy
who
sent
terms
of
accommodation
to
him
and
received
tribute
to
their
satisfaction
yet
meditated
an
attack
on
his
subjects
by
surprise
and
that
probably
they
would
commence
their
attack
in
less
than
one
day
and
concluded
with
advising
him
as
he
was
not
prepared
for
war
to
order
a
speedy
retreat
of
his
family
and
subjects
he
complied
with
this
advice
the
same
night
which
was
fixed
upon
to
retreat
my
father
and
his
family
set
off
about
break
of
day
the
king
and
his
two
younger
wives
went
in
one
company
and
my
mother
and
her
children
in
another
we
left
our
dwellings
in
succession
and
my
father
company
went
on
first
we
directed
our
course
for
a
large
shrub
plain
some
distance
off
where
we
intended
to
conceal
ourselves
from
the
approaching
enemy
until
we
could
refresh
and
rest
ourselves
a
little
but
we
presently
found
that
our
retreat
was
not
secure
for
having
struck
up
a
little
fire
for
purposes
of
cooking
victuals
the
enemy
who
happened
to
be
encamped
a
little
distance
off
had
sent
out
a
scouting
party
which
discovered
us
by
the
smoke
of
the
fire
just
as
we
were
extinguishing
it
and
about
to
eat
as
soon
as
we
had
finished
eating
my
father
discovered
the
party
and
immediately
began
to
discharge
arrows
at
them
this
was
what
i
first
saw
and
it
alarmed
both
me
and
the
women
who
being
unable
to
make
any
resistance
immediately
betook
ourselves
to
the
tall
thick
reeds
not
far
off
and
left
the
old
king
to
fight
alone
for
some
time
i
beheld
him
from
the
reeds
defending
himself
with
great
courage
and
firmness
till
at
last
he
was
obliged
to
surrender
himself
into
their
hands
then
they
came
to
us
in
the
reeds
and
the
very
first
salute
i
had
from
them
was
a
violent
blow
on
the
head
with
the
fore
part
of
a
gun
and
at
the
same
time
a
grasp
round
the
neck
i
then
had
a
rope
put
about
my
neck
as
had
all
the
women
in
the
thicket
with
me
and
were
immediately
led
to
my
father
who
was
likewise
pinioned
and
haltered
for
leading
in
this
condition
we
were
all
led
to
the
camp
the
women
and
myself
being
pretty
submissive
had
tolerable
treatment
from
the
enemy
while
my
father
was
closely
interrogated
respecting
his
money
which
they
knew
he
must
have
but
as
he
gave
them
no
account
of
it
he
was
instantly
cut
and
pounded
on
his
body
with
great
inhumanity
that
he
might
be
induced
by
the
torture
he
suffered
to
make
the
discovery
all
this
availed
not
the
least
to
make
him
give
up
his
money
but
he
despised
all
the
tortures
which
they
inflicted
until
the
continued
exercise
and
increase
of
torment
obliged
him
to
sink
and
expire
he
thus
died
without
informing
his
enemies
of
the
place
where
his
money
lay
i
saw
him
while
he
was
thus
tortured
to
death
the
shocking
scene
is
to
this
day
fresh
in
my
mind
and
i
have
often
been
overcome
while
thinking
on
it
he
was
a
man
of
remarkable
stature
i
should
judge
as
much
as
six
feet
and
six
or
seven
inches
high
two
feet
across
his
shoulders
and
every
way
well
proportioned
he
as
a
man
of
remarkable
strength
and
resolution
affable
kind
and
gentle
ruling
with
equity
and
moderation
the
army
of
the
enemy
was
large
i
should
suppose
consisting
of
about
six
thousand
men
their
leader
was
called
baukurre
after
destroying
the
old
prince
they
decamped
and
immediately
marched
towards
the
sea
lying
to
the
west
taking
with
them
myself
and
the
women
prisoners
in
the
march
a
scouting
party
was
detached
from
the
main
army
to
the
leader
of
this
party
i
was
made
waiter
having
to
carry
his
gun
as
we
were
a
scouting
we
came
across
a
herd
of
fat
cattle
consisting
of
about
thirty
in
number
these
we
set
upon
and
immediately
wrested
from
their
keepers
and
afterwards
converted
them
into
food
for
the
army
the
enemy
had
remarkable
success
in
destroying
the
country
wherever
they
went
for
as
far
as
they
had
penetrated
they
laid
the
habitations
waste
and
captured
the
people
the
distance
they
had
now
brought
me
was
about
four
hundred
miles
all
the
march
i
had
very
hard
tasks
imposed
on
me
which
i
must
perform
on
pain
of
punishment
i
was
obliged
to
carry
on
my
head
a
large
flat
stone
used
for
grinding
our
corn
weighing
as
i
should
suppose
as
much
as
pounds
besides
victuals
mat
and
cooking
utensils
though
i
was
pretty
large
and
stout
of
my
age
yet
these
burthens
were
very
grievous
to
me
being
only
about
six
years
and
a
half
old
we
were
then
come
to
a
place
called
malagafco
when
we
entered
the
place
we
could
not
see
the
least
appearance
of
either
houses
or
inhabitants
but
upon
stricter
search
found
that
instead
of
houses
above
ground
they
had
dens
in
the
sides
of
hillocks
contiguous
to
ponds
and
streams
of
water
in
these
we
perceived
they
had
all
hid
themselves
as
i
suppose
they
usually
did
upon
such
occasions
in
order
to
compel
them
to
surrender
the
enemy
contrived
to
smoke
them
out
with
faggots
these
they
put
to
the
entrance
of
the
caves
and
set
them
on
fire
while
they
were
engaged
in
this
business
to
their
great
surprise
some
of
them
were
desperately
wounded
with
arrows
which
fell
from
above
on
them
this
mystery
they
soon
found
out
they
perceived
that
the
enemy
discharged
these
arrows
through
holes
on
the
top
of
the
dens
directly
in
to
the
air
their
weight
brought
them
back
point
downwards
on
their
enemies
heads
whilst
they
were
smoking
the
inhabitants
out
the
points
of
the
arrows
were
poisoned
but
their
enemy
had
an
antidote
for
it
which
they
instantly
applied
to
the
wounded
part
the
smoke
at
last
obliged
the
people
to
give
themselves
up
they
came
out
of
their
caves
first
spatting
the
palms
of
their
hands
together
then
and
immediately
after
extended
their
arms
crossed
at
their
wrists
ready
to
be
bound
and
pinioned
i
should
judge
that
the
dens
above
mentioned
were
extended
about
eight
feet
horizontally
into
the
earth
five
feet
in
height
and
as
many
wide
they
were
arched
over
head
and
lined
with
earth
which
was
of
the
clay
kind
and
made
the
surface
of
their
walls
firm
and
smooth
the
invaders
then
pinioned
the
prisoners
of
all
ages
and
sexes
indiscriminately
took
their
flocks
and
all
their
effects
and
moved
on
their
way
towards
the
sea
on
the
march
the
prisoners
were
treated
with
clemency
on
account
of
their
being
submissive
and
humble
having
come
to
the
next
tribe
the
enemy
laid
siege
and
immediately
took
men
women
children
flocks
and
all
their
valuable
effects
they
then
went
on
to
the
next
district
which
was
contiguous
with
the
sea
called
in
africa
anamaboo
the
enemies
provisions
were
then
almost
spent
as
well
as
their
strength
the
inhabitants
knowing
what
kind
of
conduct
they
had
pursued
and
what
were
their
present
intentions
improved
the
favorable
opportunity
attacked
them
and
took
enemy
prisoners
flocks
and
all
their
effects
i
was
then
taken
a
second
time
all
of
us
were
then
put
into
the
castle
and
kept
for
market
on
a
certain
time
i
and
other
prisoners
were
put
on
board
a
canoe
under
our
master
and
rowed
away
to
a
vessel
belonging
to
rhode
island
commanded
by
capt
collingwood
and
the
mate
thomas
mumford
while
we
were
going
to
the
vessel
our
master
told
us
all
to
appear
to
the
best
possible
advantage
for
sale
i
was
bought
on
board
by
one
robertson
mumford
steward
of
said
vessel
for
four
gallons
of
rum
and
a
piece
of
calico
and
called
venture
on
account
of
his
having
purchased
me
with
his
own
private
venture
thus
i
came
by
my
name
all
the
slaves
that
were
bought
for
that
vessel
cargo
were
two
hundred
and
sixty
chapter
ii
an
account
of
his
life
from
the
time
of
his
leaving
africa
to
that
of
his
becoming
after
all
the
business
was
ended
on
the
coast
of
africa
the
ship
sailed
from
thence
to
barbadoes
after
an
ordinary
passage
except
great
mortality
from
small
pox
which
broke
out
on
board
we
arrived
at
the
island
of
barbadoes
but
when
we
reached
it
there
were
found
out
of
the
two
hundred
and
sixty
that
sailed
from
africa
not
more
than
two
hundred
alive
these
were
all
sold
except
for
myself
and
three
more
to
the
planters
there
the
vessel
then
sailed
for
rhode
island
and
arrived
there
after
a
comfortable
passage
here
my
master
sent
me
to
live
with
one
of
his
sisters
until
he
could
carry
me
to
fisher
island
the
place
of
his
residence
i
had
then
competed
my
eighth
year
after
staying
with
his
sister
some
time
i
was
taken
to
my
master
place
to
live
when
we
arrived
at
narragansett
my
master
went
ashore
in
order
to
return
a
part
of
the
way
by
land
and
gave
me
the
charge
of
the
keys
of
his
trunks
on
board
the
vessel
and
charged
me
not
to
deliver
them
up
to
any
body
not
even
to
his
father
without
his
orders
to
his
directions
i
promised
faithfully
to
conform
when
i
arrived
with
my
master
articles
at
his
house
my
master
father
asked
me
for
his
son
keys
as
he
wanted
to
see
what
his
trunks
contained
i
told
him
that
my
master
intrusted
me
with
the
care
of
them
until
he
should
return
and
that
i
had
given
him
my
word
to
be
faithful
to
the
trust
and
could
not
therefore
give
him
or
any
other
person
the
keys
without
my
master
directions
he
insisted
that
i
should
deliver
him
the
keys
threatening
to
punish
me
if
i
did
not
but
i
let
him
know
that
he
should
not
have
them
say
what
he
would
he
then
laid
aside
trying
to
get
them
but
notwithstanding
he
appeared
to
give
up
trying
to
obtain
them
from
me
yet
i
mistrusted
that
he
would
take
some
time
when
i
was
off
my
guard
either
in
the
day
time
or
at
night
to
get
them
therefore
i
slung
them
around
my
neck
and
in
the
day
concealed
them
in
my
bosom
and
at
night
i
always
lay
with
them
under
me
that
no
person
might
take
them
from
me
without
being
apprized
of
it
thus
i
kept
the
keys
from
every
body
until
my
master
came
home
when
he
returned
he
asked
where
venture
was
as
i
was
then
within
hearing
i
came
said
here
sir
at
your
service
he
asked
me
for
his
keys
and
i
immediately
took
them
off
my
neck
and
reached
them
out
to
him
he
took
them
stroked
my
hair
and
commended
me
saying
in
presence
of
his
father
that
his
young
venture
was
so
faithful
that
he
would
never
have
been
able
to
have
taken
the
keys
from
him
but
by
violence
that
he
should
not
fear
to
trust
him
with
his
whole
fortune
for
that
he
had
been
in
his
native
place
so
habituated
to
keeping
his
word
that
he
would
sacrifice
even
his
life
to
maintain
it
the
first
of
the
time
of
living
at
my
master
own
place
i
was
pretty
much
employed
in
the
house
at
carding
wool
and
other
household
business
in
this
situation
i
continued
for
some
years
after
which
my
master
put
me
to
work
out
of
doors
after
many
proofs
of
my
faithfulness
and
honesty
my
master
began
to
put
great
confidence
in
me
my
behavior
to
him
had
as
yet
been
submissive
and
obedient
i
then
began
to
have
hard
tasks
imposed
on
me
some
of
these
were
to
pound
four
bushels
of
ears
of
corn
every
night
in
a
barrel
for
the
poultry
or
be
rigorously
punished
at
other
seasons
of
the
year
i
had
to
card
wool
until
a
very
late
hour
these
tasks
i
had
to
perform
when
i
was
about
nine
years
old
some
time
after
i
had
another
difficulty
and
oppression
which
was
greater
than
any
i
had
ever
experienced
since
i
came
into
this
country
this
was
to
serve
two
masters
james
mumford
my
master
son
when
his
father
had
gone
from
home
in
the
morning
and
given
me
a
stint
to
perform
that
day
would
order
me
to
do
and
business
different
from
what
my
master
directed
me
one
day
in
particular
the
authority
which
my
master
son
had
set
up
had
like
to
have
produce
melancholy
effects
for
my
master
having
set
me
off
my
business
to
perform
that
day
and
then
left
me
to
perform
it
his
son
came
up
to
me
in
the
course
of
the
day
big
with
authority
and
and
commanded
me
very
arrogantly
to
quit
my
present
business
and
go
directly
about
what
he
should
order
me
i
replied
to
him
that
my
master
had
given
me
so
much
to
perform
that
day
and
that
i
must
therefore
faithfully
complete
it
in
that
time
he
then
broke
out
in
a
great
rage
snatched
a
pitchfork
and
went
to
lay
me
over
the
head
therewith
but
i
as
soon
got
another
and
defended
myself
with
it
or
otherwise
he
might
have
murdered
me
in
his
outrage
he
immediately
called
some
people
who
were
hearing
at
work
for
him
and
ordered
them
to
take
his
hair
rope
and
and
come
and
bind
me
with
it
they
all
tried
to
bind
me
but
in
vain
tho
there
were
three
assistants
in
number
my
upstart
master
than
desisted
put
his
pocket
handkerchief
before
his
eyes
and
went
home
with
a
design
to
tell
his
mother
of
the
struggle
with
young
venture
he
told
her
that
their
young
venture
had
become
so
stubborn
that
he
could
not
controul
him
and
asked
her
what
he
should
do
with
him
in
the
mean
time
i
recovered
my
temper
voluntarily
caused
myself
to
be
bound
by
the
same
men
who
tried
in
vain
before
and
carried
before
my
young
master
that
he
might
do
what
he
pleased
with
me
he
took
me
to
a
gallows
made
for
the
purpose
of
hanging
cattle
on
and
suspended
me
on
it
afterwards
he
ordered
one
of
his
hands
to
go
to
the
peach
orchard
and
cut
him
three
dozens
of
whips
to
punish
me
with
these
were
brought
to
him
and
that
was
all
that
was
done
with
them
as
i
was
released
and
went
to
work
after
hanging
on
the
gallows
about
an
hour
after
i
lived
with
my
master
thirteen
years
being
then
about
twenty
two
years
old
i
married
meg
a
slave
of
his
who
was
about
my
age
my
master
owned
a
certain
irishman
named
heddy
who
about
that
time
formed
a
plan
of
secretly
leaving
his
master
after
he
had
long
had
this
plan
in
meditation
he
suggested
it
to
me
at
first
i
cast
a
deaf
ear
on
it
and
rebuked
heddy
for
harboring
in
his
mind
such
a
rash
undertaking
but
after
he
had
persuaded
and
much
enchanted
me
with
the
prospect
of
gaining
my
freedom
with
such
a
method
i
at
length
agreed
to
accompany
him
heddy
next
inveigled
two
of
his
fellow
servants
to
accompany
us
the
place
to
which
we
designed
to
go
was
the
mississippi
our
next
business
was
to
lay
in
a
sufficient
store
of
provisions
for
our
voyage
we
privately
collected
out
of
our
master
store
six
great
old
cheeses
two
firkins
of
butter
and
one
whole
batch
of
new
bread
when
we
had
gathered
all
our
own
clothes
and
some
more
we
took
them
all
about
midnight
and
went
to
the
water
side
we
stole
our
master
boat
embarked
then
directed
our
course
for
the
mississippi
river
we
mutually
confederated
not
to
betray
or
desert
one
another
on
pain
of
death
we
first
steered
our
course
for
montauk
point
the
east
end
of
after
our
arrival
there
we
landed
and
heddy
and
i
made
an
incursion
into
the
island
after
fresh
water
while
our
two
comrades
were
left
at
a
little
distance
from
the
boat
employed
at
cooking
when
heddy
and
i
had
sought
some
time
for
water
he
returned
to
our
companions
and
i
continued
on
looking
for
my
object
when
heddy
had
performed
his
business
with
our
companions
who
were
engaged
in
cooking
he
went
directly
to
the
boat
stole
all
the
clothes
in
it
and
then
travelled
away
for
as
i
was
informed
i
returned
to
my
fellows
not
long
after
they
informed
me
that
our
clothes
were
stolen
but
could
not
determine
who
was
the
thief
yet
they
suspected
heddy
as
he
was
missing
after
reproving
my
two
comrades
for
not
taking
care
of
our
things
which
were
in
the
boat
i
advertised
heddy
and
sent
two
men
in
search
of
him
they
pursued
and
overtook
him
at
southampton
and
returned
him
to
the
boat
i
then
thought
it
might
afford
some
chance
for
my
freedom
or
at
least
a
palliation
for
my
running
away
to
return
heddy
immediately
to
his
master
and
inform
him
that
i
was
induced
to
go
away
by
address
accordingly
i
set
off
with
him
and
the
rest
of
my
companions
for
our
master
and
arrived
there
without
any
difficulty
i
informed
my
master
that
heddy
was
the
ringleader
of
our
revolt
and
that
he
had
used
us
ill
he
immediately
put
heddy
into
custody
and
myself
and
companions
were
well
received
and
went
to
work
as
usual
not
a
long
time
passed
after
that
before
heddy
was
sent
by
my
master
to
gaol
at
the
close
of
that
year
i
was
sold
to
a
thomas
stanton
and
had
to
be
separated
from
my
wife
and
one
daughter
who
was
about
one
month
old
he
resided
at
to
this
place
i
brought
with
me
from
my
last
master
two
johannes
three
old
spanish
dollars
and
two
thousand
of
coppers
besides
five
pounds
of
my
wife
money
this
money
i
got
by
cleaning
gentlemen
shoes
and
drawing
boots
by
catching
and
minks
raising
potatoes
and
carrots
and
by
fishing
in
the
night
and
at
odd
spells
all
this
money
amounting
to
near
pounds
york
currency
my
master
brother
robert
stanton
hired
of
me
for
which
he
gave
me
his
note
about
one
year
and
a
half
after
that
time
my
master
purchased
my
wife
and
and
her
child
for
severn
hundred
pounds
old
tenor
one
time
my
master
sent
me
two
miles
after
a
barrel
of
molasses
and
ordered
me
to
carry
it
on
my
shoulders
i
made
out
to
carry
it
all
the
way
to
my
master
house
when
i
lived
with
captain
george
mumford
only
to
try
my
strength
i
took
up
on
my
knees
a
tierce
of
salt
containing
seven
bushels
and
carried
it
two
or
three
rods
of
this
fact
there
are
several
eye
witnesses
now
living
towards
the
close
of
the
time
that
i
resided
with
this
master
i
had
a
falling
out
with
my
mistress
this
happened
one
time
when
my
master
was
gone
to
a
gunning
at
first
the
quarrel
began
between
my
wife
and
her
mistress
i
was
then
at
work
in
the
barn
and
hearing
a
racket
in
the
house
induced
me
to
run
there
and
see
what
had
broken
out
when
i
entered
the
house
i
found
my
mistress
in
a
violent
passion
with
my
wife
for
what
she
informed
me
was
a
mere
trifle
such
a
small
affair
that
i
forbear
to
put
my
mistress
to
the
shame
of
having
it
known
i
earnestly
requested
my
wife
to
beg
pardon
of
her
mistress
for
the
sake
of
peace
even
if
she
had
given
no
just
occasion
for
offence
but
whilst
i
was
thus
saying
my
mistress
turned
the
blows
which
she
was
repeating
on
my
wife
to
me
she
took
down
her
and
while
she
was
glutting
her
fury
with
it
i
reached
out
my
great
black
hand
raised
it
up
and
received
the
blows
of
the
whip
on
it
which
were
designed
for
my
head
then
i
immediately
committed
the
whip
to
the
devouring
fire
when
my
master
returned
from
the
island
his
wife
told
him
of
the
affair
but
for
the
present
he
seemed
to
take
no
notice
of
it
and
mentioned
not
a
word
of
it
to
me
some
days
after
his
return
in
the
morning
as
i
was
putting
on
a
log
in
the
not
suspecting
harm
from
any
one
i
received
a
most
violent
stroke
on
the
crown
of
my
head
with
a
club
two
feet
long
and
and
as
large
around
as
a
post
this
blow
very
badly
wounded
my
head
and
the
scar
of
it
remains
to
this
day
the
first
blow
made
me
have
my
wits
about
me
as
you
may
suppose
for
as
soon
as
he
went
to
renew
it
i
snatched
the
club
out
of
his
hands
and
dragged
him
out
of
the
door
he
then
sent
for
his
brother
to
come
and
assist
him
but
i
presently
left
my
master
took
the
club
he
wounded
me
with
carried
it
to
a
neighboring
justice
of
the
peace
and
complained
of
my
master
he
finally
advised
me
to
return
to
my
master
and
live
contented
with
him
until
he
abused
me
again
and
then
complain
i
consented
to
do
accordingly
but
before
i
set
out
for
my
master
up
he
come
and
his
brother
robert
after
me
the
justice
improved
this
convenient
opportunity
to
caution
my
master
he
asked
him
for
what
he
treated
his
slave
thus
hastily
and
unjustly
and
told
him
what
would
be
the
consequence
if
he
continued
the
same
treatment
towards
me
after
the
justice
had
ended
his
discourse
with
my
master
he
and
his
brother
set
out
with
me
for
home
one
before
and
the
other
behind
me
when
they
had
come
to
a
bye
place
they
both
dismounted
their
respective
horses
and
fell
to
beating
me
with
great
violence
i
became
enraged
at
this
and
immediately
turned
them
both
under
me
laid
one
of
them
across
the
other
and
stamped
both
with
my
feet
what
i
would
this
occasioned
my
master
brother
to
advise
him
to
put
me
off
a
short
time
after
this
i
was
taken
by
a
constable
and
two
men
they
carried
me
to
a
shop
and
had
me
when
i
returned
home
my
mistress
enquired
much
of
her
waiters
whether
venture
was
when
she
was
informed
that
i
was
she
appeared
to
be
very
contented
and
was
much
transported
with
the
news
in
the
midst
of
all
this
content
and
joy
i
presented
myself
before
my
mistress
shewed
her
my
and
gave
her
thanks
for
my
gold
rings
for
this
my
master
commanded
a
negro
of
his
to
fetch
him
a
large
ox
chain
this
my
master
locked
on
my
legs
with
two
padlocks
i
continued
to
wear
the
chain
peaceably
for
two
or
three
days
when
my
master
asked
me
with
contemptuous
hard
names
whether
i
had
not
better
be
freed
from
my
chains
and
go
to
work
i
answered
him
no
well
then
said
he
i
will
send
you
to
the
or
banish
you
for
i
am
resolved
not
to
keep
you
i
answered
him
i
crossed
the
waters
to
come
here
and
i
am
willing
to
cross
them
to
return
for
a
day
or
two
after
this
not
any
one
said
much
to
me
until
one
hempsted
miner
of
stonington
asked
me
if
i
would
live
with
him
i
answered
him
that
i
would
he
then
requested
me
to
make
myself
discontented
and
to
appear
as
unreconciled
to
my
master
as
i
could
before
that
he
bargained
with
him
for
me
and
that
in
return
he
would
give
me
a
good
chance
to
gain
my
freedom
when
i
came
to
live
with
him
i
did
as
he
requested
me
not
long
after
hempsted
miner
purchased
me
of
my
master
for
pounds
lawful
he
took
the
chain
and
padlocks
off
me
immediately
after
it
may
here
be
remembered
that
i
related
a
few
pages
back
that
i
hired
out
a
sum
of
money
to
robert
stanton
and
took
his
note
for
it
in
the
fray
between
my
master
stanton
and
myself
he
broke
open
my
chest
containing
his
brother
note
to
me
and
destroyed
it
immediately
after
my
present
master
bought
me
he
determined
to
sell
me
at
hartford
as
soon
as
i
became
apprized
of
it
i
bethought
myself
that
i
would
secure
a
certain
sum
of
money
which
lay
by
me
safer
than
to
hire
it
out
to
stanton
accordingly
i
buried
it
in
the
earth
a
little
distance
from
thomas
stanton
in
the
road
over
which
he
passed
daily
a
short
time
after
my
master
carried
me
to
hartford
and
first
proposed
to
sell
me
to
one
william
hooker
of
that
place
hooker
asked
whether
i
would
go
to
the
german
flats
with
him
i
answered
no
he
said
i
should
if
not
by
fair
means
i
should
by
foul
if
you
will
go
by
no
other
measures
i
will
tie
you
down
in
my
sleigh
i
replied
to
him
that
if
he
carried
me
in
that
manner
no
person
would
purchase
me
for
it
would
be
thought
that
he
had
a
murderer
for
sale
after
this
he
tried
no
more
and
said
he
would
not
have
me
as
a
gift
my
master
next
offered
me
to
daniel
edwards
esq
of
hartford
for
sale
but
not
purchasing
me
my
master
pawned
me
to
him
for
ten
pounds
and
returned
to
stonington
after
some
trial
of
my
honesty
edwards
placed
considerable
trust
and
confidence
in
me
he
put
me
to
serve
as
his
and
waiter
when
there
was
company
at
his
house
he
would
send
me
into
his
cellar
and
other
parts
of
his
house
to
fetch
wine
and
other
articles
occasionally
for
them
when
i
had
been
with
him
for
some
time
he
asked
me
why
my
master
wished
to
part
with
such
an
honest
negro
and
why
he
did
not
keep
me
himself
i
replied
that
i
could
not
give
him
the
reason
unless
it
was
to
convert
me
into
cash
and
speculate
with
me
as
with
other
commodities
i
hope
he
can
never
justly
say
it
was
on
account
of
my
ill
conduct
that
he
did
no
keep
me
himself
mr
edwards
told
me
that
he
should
be
very
willing
to
keep
me
himself
and
that
he
would
never
let
me
go
from
him
to
live
if
it
was
not
unreasonable
and
inconvenient
for
me
to
be
parted
from
my
wife
and
children
therefore
he
would
furnish
me
with
a
horse
to
return
to
stonington
if
i
had
a
mind
for
it
as
miner
did
not
appear
to
redeem
me
i
went
at
called
at
my
old
master
first
to
see
my
wife
who
was
then
owned
by
him
as
my
old
master
appeared
much
ruffled
at
my
being
there
i
left
my
wife
before
i
had
spent
considerable
time
with
her
and
went
to
colonel
smith
miner
had
not
as
yet
wholly
settled
with
stanton
for
me
and
had
before
my
return
from
hartford
given
smith
a
bill
of
sale
for
me
these
men
once
met
to
determine
which
of
them
should
hold
me
and
upon
my
expressing
a
desire
to
be
owned
by
smith
and
upon
my
settling
the
remainder
of
the
money
which
was
due
stanton
for
me
it
was
agreed
that
i
should
live
with
smith
this
was
the
third
time
of
my
being
sold
and
i
was
then
years
old
as
i
never
had
an
opportunity
of
redeeming
myself
whilst
i
was
owned
by
miner
though
he
promised
to
give
me
a
chance
i
was
then
very
ambitious
of
obtaining
it
i
asked
my
master
one
time
if
he
would
consent
to
have
me
purchase
my
freedom
he
replied
that
he
would
i
was
then
very
happy
knowing
that
i
was
at
that
time
able
to
pay
part
of
the
purchase
money
by
means
of
the
money
which
i
some
time
since
buried
this
i
took
out
of
the
earth
and
tendered
to
my
master
having
previously
engaged
a
free
negro
man
to
take
take
his
security
for
it
as
i
was
the
property
of
my
master
and
therefore
could
not
safely
take
his
obligation
myself
what
was
wanted
in
redeeming
myself
my
master
agreed
to
wait
on
me
for
until
i
could
procure
it
for
him
i
still
continued
to
work
for
smith
ther
was
continually
some
interest
accruing
on
my
master
note
to
my
friend
the
free
negro
man
above
named
which
i
received
and
with
some
besides
which
i
got
by
fishing
i
laid
out
in
land
adjoining
my
old
master
stanton
by
cultivating
this
land
with
the
greatest
diligence
and
economy
at
times
when
my
master
did
not
require
my
labor
in
two
years
i
laid
up
ten
pounds
this
my
friend
tendered
to
my
master
for
myself
and
received
his
note
for
it
being
encouraged
by
the
success
which
i
had
met
in
redeeming
myself
i
again
solicited
my
master
for
a
further
chance
of
completing
it
the
chance
for
which
i
solicited
him
was
that
of
going
out
to
work
the
ensuing
winter
he
agreed
to
this
on
condition
that
i
would
give
him
one
quarter
of
my
earnings
on
these
terms
i
worked
the
following
winter
and
earned
four
pounds
sixteen
shillings
one
quarter
of
which
went
to
my
master
for
the
privilege
and
the
rest
was
paid
him
on
my
own
account
this
added
to
the
other
payments
made
up
forty
four
pounds
eight
shillings
which
i
had
paid
on
my
own
account
i
was
then
about
thirty
five
years
old
the
next
summer
i
again
desired
he
would
give
me
a
chance
of
going
out
to
work
but
he
refused
and
answered
that
he
must
have
my
labor
this
summer
as
he
did
not
have
it
the
past
winter
i
replied
that
i
considered
it
as
hard
that
i
could
not
have
a
chance
to
work
out
when
the
season
became
advantageous
and
that
i
must
only
be
permitted
to
hire
myself
out
in
the
poorest
season
of
the
year
he
asked
me
after
this
what
i
would
give
for
the
privilege
per
month
i
replied
that
i
would
leave
it
wholly
with
his
own
generosity
to
determine
what
i
should
return
him
a
month
well
then
said
he
if
so
two
pounds
a
month
i
answered
him
that
if
that
was
the
least
he
would
take
i
would
be
contented
accordingly
i
hired
myself
out
at
fisher
island
and
earned
twenty
pounds
thirteen
pounds
six
shillings
of
which
my
master
drew
for
the
privilege
and
the
remainder
i
paid
him
for
my
freedom
this
made
pounds
two
shillings
which
i
paid
him
in
october
following
i
went
and
wrought
six
months
at
long
island
in
that
six
time
i
cut
and
corded
four
hundred
cords
of
wood
besides
threshing
out
bushels
of
grain
and
received
of
my
wages
down
only
twenty
pounds
which
left
remaining
a
larger
sum
whilst
i
was
out
that
time
i
took
upon
my
wages
only
one
pair
of
shoes
at
night
i
lay
upon
the
hearth
with
one
coverlet
over
and
another
under
me
i
returned
to
my
master
and
gave
him
what
i
received
on
my
six
months
labor
this
left
only
thirteen
pounds
eighteen
shillings
to
make
up
the
full
sum
for
my
redemption
my
master
liberated
me
saying
i
might
pay
what
was
behind
if
i
could
ever
make
it
convenient
otherwise
it
would
be
well
the
amount
of
the
money
which
i
had
paid
my
master
towards
redeeming
my
time
was
pounds
two
shillings
the
reason
of
my
master
for
asking
such
an
unreasonable
price
was
he
said
to
secure
himself
in
case
i
should
ever
come
to
want
being
years
old
i
left
smith
once
for
all
i
had
already
been
sold
three
different
times
made
considerable
money
with
seemingly
nothing
to
derive
it
from
been
cheated
out
of
a
large
sum
of
money
lost
much
by
misfortunes
and
paid
an
enormous
sum
for
my
freedom
chapter
iii
an
account
of
his
life
from
the
time
of
his
purchasing
his
freedom
to
the
present
my
wife
and
children
were
yet
in
bondage
to
thomas
stanton
about
this
time
i
lost
a
chest
containing
besides
clothing
about
eight
pounds
in
paper
money
it
was
burnt
by
accident
a
short
time
after
i
sold
all
my
possessions
at
stonington
consisting
of
a
pretty
piece
of
land
and
one
dwelling
house
thereon
and
went
to
reside
at
for
the
first
four
years
of
my
residence
there
i
spent
my
time
in
working
for
various
people
on
that
and
at
the
neighboring
islands
i
the
space
of
six
months
i
cut
and
corded
upwards
of
four
hundred
cords
of
wood
many
other
singular
and
wonderful
labors
i
performed
in
cutting
wood
there
which
would
not
be
inferior
to
those
just
recited
but
for
brevity
sake
i
must
omit
them
in
the
aforementioned
four
years
what
wood
i
cut
at
amounted
to
several
thousand
cords
and
the
money
which
i
earned
thereby
amounted
to
two
hundred
and
seven
pounds
ten
shillings
this
money
i
laid
up
carefully
by
me
perhaps
some
may
enquire
what
maintained
me
all
the
time
i
was
laying
up
money
i
would
inform
them
that
i
bought
nothing
which
i
did
not
absolutely
want
all
fine
clothes
i
despised
in
comparison
with
my
interest
and
never
kept
but
just
what
clothes
were
comfortable
for
common
days
and
perhaps
i
would
have
a
garment
or
two
which
i
did
not
have
on
at
all
times
but
as
for
superfluous
finery
i
never
thought
it
to
be
compared
with
a
decent
homespun
dress
a
good
supply
of
money
and
prudence
expensive
gatherings
of
my
mates
i
commonly
shunned
and
all
kinds
of
luxuries
i
was
perfectly
a
stranger
to
and
during
the
time
i
was
employed
in
cutting
the
aforementioned
quantity
of
wood
i
never
was
at
the
expense
of
worth
of
spirits
being
after
this
labor
forty
years
of
age
i
worked
at
various
places
and
in
particular
on
which
i
purchased
solomon
and
cuff
two
sons
of
mine
for
two
hundred
dollars
each
it
will
here
be
remembered
how
much
money
i
earned
by
cutting
wood
in
four
years
besides
this
i
had
considerable
money
amounting
in
all
to
near
three
hundred
pounds
after
this
i
purchased
a
negro
man
for
no
other
reason
than
to
oblige
him
and
gave
him
sixty
pounds
but
in
a
short
time
after
he
run
away
from
me
and
i
thereby
lost
all
that
i
gave
for
him
except
twenty
pounds
which
he
paid
me
previous
to
his
absconding
the
rest
of
my
money
i
laid
out
in
land
in
addition
to
a
farm
which
i
owned
before
and
a
dwelling

this
existence
of
servitude
and
misfortune
solomon
my
eldest
son
being
then
in
his
seventeenth
year
and
all
my
hope
and
dependence
for
help
i
hired
him
out
to
one
charles
church
of
rhode
island
for
one
year
on
consideration
of
his
giving
him
twelve
pounds
and
an
opportunity
of
acquiring
some
learning
in
the
course
of
the
year
church
fitted
out
a
vessel
for
a
whaling
voyage
and
being
in
want
of
hands
to
man
her
he
induced
my
son
to
go
with
the
promise
of
giving
him
on
his
return
a
pair
of
silver
buckles
besides
his
wages
as
soon
as
i
heard
of
his
going
to
sea
i
immediately
set
out
to
go
and
prevent
it
if
possible
but
on
my
arrival
at
church
to
my
great
grief
i
could
only
see
the
vessel
my
son
was
on
almost
out
of
sight
going
to
sea
my
son
died
of
the
scurvy
on
this
voyage
and
church
has
never
yet
paid
me
the
least
of
his
wages
in
my
son
besides
the
loss
of
his
life
i
lost
equal
to
pounds
my
other
son
being
but
a
youth
still
lived
with
me
about
this
time
i
chartered
a
sloop
of
about
thirty
tons
burthen
and
hired
men
to
assist
me
in
navigating
her
i
employed
her
mostly
in
the
wood
trade
to
and
made
clear
of
all
expenses
above
one
hundred
dollars
with
her
in
better
than
one
year
i
had
then
become
something
forehanded
and
being
in
my
year
i
purchased
my
wife
meg
and
thereby
prevented
having
another
child
to
buy
as
she
was
then
pregnant
i
gave
forty
pounds
for
her
during
my
residence
at
i
raised
one
year
with
another
ten
cart
loads
of
and
lost
a
great
many
every
year
besides
by
the
thievishness
of
the
sailors
what
i
made
by
the
melons
i
sold
there
amounted
to
nearly
five
hundred
dollars
various
other
methods
i
in
order
to
enable
me
to
redeem
my
family
in
the
i
fished
with
and
pots
for
eels
and
lobsters
and
shortly
after
went
a
whaling
voyage
in
the
service
of
smith
after
being
seven
months
the
vessel
returned
laden
with
four
hundred
barrels
of
oil
about
this
time
i
became
possessed
of
another
and
my
temporal
affairs
were
in
a
pretty
prosperous
condition
this
and
my
industry
was
what
alone
saved
me
from
being
expelled
that
part
of
the
island
in
which
i
resided
as
an
act
was
passed
by
the
of
the
place
that
all
negroes
residing
there
should
be
expelled
next
after
my
wife
i
purchased
a
negro
man
for
four
hundred
dollars
but
he
having
an
inclination
to
return
to
his
old
master
i
therefore
let
him
go
shortly
after
i
purchased
another
negro
man
for
five
pounds
who
i
parted
with
shortly
after
being
about
years
old
i
bought
my
oldest
child
hannah
of
ray
mumford
for
pounds
and
she
still
resided
with
him
i
had
already
redeemed
from
slavery
myself
my
wife
and
three
children
besides
three
negro
men
about
the
year
of
my
life
i
disposed
all
my
property
at
and
came
from
thence
into
i
hired
myself
out
at
first
to
timothy
chapman
for
five
weeks
the
earnings
of
which
time
i
put
carefully
by
me
after
this
i
wrought
for
abel
bingham
about
six
weeks
i
then
put
my
money
together
and
purchased
of
said
bingham
ten
acres
of
land
lying
at
haddam
neck
where
i
now
reside
on
this
land
i
labored
with
great
diligence
for
two
years
and
shortly
after
purchased
six
acres
more
of
land
contiguous
to
my
other
one
year
from
that
time
i
purchased
seventy
acres
more
of
the
same
man
and
paid
for
it
mostly
with
the
produce
of
my
other
land
soon
after
i
bought
this
lot
of
land
i
set
up
a
comfortable
dwelling
house
on
my
farm
and
built
it
from
the
produce
thereof
shortly
after
i
had
much
trouble
and
expense
with
my
daughter
hannah
whose
name
has
before
been
mentioned
in
this
account
she
was
married
soon
after
i
redeemed
her
to
one
isaac
a
free
negro
and
shortly
after
her
marriage
fell
sick
of
a
mortal
disease
her
husband
a
dissolute
and
abandoned
wretch
paid
but
little
attention
to
her
in
her
illness
i
therefore
thought
it
best
to
bring
her
to
my
house
and
nurse
her
there
i
procured
her
all
the
aid
mortals
could
afford
but
notwithstanding
this
she
fell
a
prey
to
her
disease
after
a
lingering
and
painful
endurance
of
it
the
physician
bills
for
attending
her
during
her
illness
amounted
to
forty
pounds
having
reached
my
year
i
hired
two
negro
men
one
named
william
jacklin
and
the
other
mingo
mingo
lived
with
me
one
year
and
having
received
his
wages
run
in
debt
to
me
eight
dollars
for
which
he
gave
me
his
note
i
procured
a
warrant
took
him
and
requested
him
to
go
to
justice
throop
of
his
own
accord
but
he
refusing
i
took
him
on
my
shoulders
and
carried
him
there
distant
about
two
miles
the
justice
asking
me
if
i
had
my
note
with
me
and
replying
that
i
had
not
he
told
me
that
i
must
return
with
him
and
get
it
accordingly
i
carried
mingo
back
on
my
shoulders
but
before
we
arrived
at
my
dwelling
he
complained
of
being
hurt
and
asked
me
if
this
was
not
a
hard
way
of
treating
our
fellow
creatures
i
answered
him
that
it
would
be
hard
thus
to
treat
our
honest
fellow
creatures
he
then
told
me
that
if
i
would
let
him
off
my
shoulders
he
had
a
pair
of
silver
one
shirt
and
a
pocket
handkerchief
which
he
would
turn
out
to
me
i
agreed
and
let
him
return
home
with
me
on
foot
but
the
very
following
night
he
slipped
from
me
stole
my
horse
and
has
never
paid
me
even
his
note
the
other
negro
man
jacklin
being
a
by
trade
he
requested
me
to
set
him
up
and
promised
to
reward
me
well
with
his
labor
accordingly
i
bought
him
a
set
of
tools
for
making
combs
and
procured
him
stock
he
worked
at
my
house
about
one
year
and
then
run
away
from
me
with
all
his
combs
and
owed
me
for
all
his
board
since
my
residence
at
haddam
neck
i
have
owned
of
boats
canoes
and
sail
vessels
not
less
than
twenty
these
i
mostly
employed
in
the
fishing
and
trafficking
business
and
in
these
occupations
i
have
been
cheated
out
of
considerable
money
by
people
whom
i
traded
with
taking
advantage
of
my
ignorance
of
numbers
about
twelve
years
ago
i
hired
a
and
four
black
men
and
proceeded
to
after
a
load
of
round
clams
having
arrived
there
i
first
purchased
of
james
webb
son
of
orange
webb
six
hundred
and
sixty
clams
and
afterwards
with
the
help
of
my
men
finished
loading
my
boat
the
same
evening
however
this
webb
stole
my
boat
and
went
in
her
to
connecticut
river
and
sold
her
cargo
for
his
own
benefit
i
thereupon
pursued
him
and
at
length
after
an
additional
expence
of
nine
crowns
recovered
the
boat
but
for
the
proceeds
of
her
cargo
i
never
could
obtain
any
compensation
four
years
after
i
met
with
another
loss
far
superior
to
this
in
value
and
i
think
by
no
less
wicked
means
being
going
to
with
a
i
took
passage
on
an
indian
boat
and
went
there
with
him
on
our
return
the
indian
took
on
board
two
hogsheads
of
molasses
one
of
which
belonged
to
capt
elisha
hart
of
saybrook
to
be
delivered
to
his
wharf
when
we
arrived
there
and
while
i
was
gone
at
the
request
of
the
indian
to
inform
captain
hart
of
his
arrival
and
receive
the
freight
for
him
one
hogshead
of
the
molasses
had
been
lost
overboard
by
the
people
in
attempting
to
land
it
on
the
wharf
although
i
was
absent
at
the
time
and
had
no
concern
whatever
in
the
business
and
was
known
to
a
number
of
respectable
witnesses
i
was
nevertheless
persecuted
by
this
conscientious
gentleman
the
indian
not
being
able
to
pay
for
it
and
obliged
to
pay
upwards
of
ten
pounds
lawful
money
with
all
the
costs
of
court
i
applied
to
several
gentlemen
for
counsel
in
this
affair
and
they
advised
me
as
my
adversary
was
rich
and
threatened
to
carry
the
matter
from
court
to
court
till
it
would
cost
me
more
than
the
first
damages
would
be
to
pay
the
sum
and
submit
to
the
injury
which
i
accordingly
did
and
he
has
often
since
insultingly
taunted
me
with
my
unmerited
misfortune
such
a
proceeding
as
this
committed
on
a
defenseless
stranger
almost
worn
out
in
the
hard
service
of
the
world
without
any
foundation
in
reason
or
justice
whatever
it
may
be
called
in
a
christian
land
would
in
my
native
country
be
branded
a
crime
equal
to
highway
robbery
but
captain
hart
was
a
and
i
a
african
and
therefore
it
was
right
and
good
enough
for
the
black
i
am
now
sixty
nine
years
old
though
once
straight
and
tall
measuring
without
shoes
six
feet
one
inch
and
an
half
and
every
way
well
proportioned
i
am
now
bowed
down
with
age
and
hardship
my
strength
which
was
once
equal
if
not
superior
to
any
man
whom
i
have
ever
seen
is
now
enfeebled
so
that
life
is
a
burden
and
it
is
with
fatigue
that
i
can
walk
a
couple
of
miles
stooping
over
my
staff
other
griefs
are
still
behind
on
account
of
which
some
aged
people
at
least
will
pity
me
my
has
gradually
failed
till
i
am
almost
blind
and
whenever
i
go
abroad
one
of
my
must
direct
my
way
besides
for
many
years
i
have
been
much
pained
and
troubled
with
an
ulcer
on
one
of
my
legs
but
amidst
all
my
griefs
and
pains
i
have
many
consolations
meg
the
wife
of
my
youth
whom
i
married
for
love
and
bought
with
my
money
is
still
alive
my
freedom
is
a
privilege
which
nothing
else
can
equal
notwithstanding
all
the
losses
i
have
suffered
by
fire
by
the
injustice
of
knaves
by
the
cruelty
and
oppression
of
friends
and
the
perfidy
of
my
own
countrymen
whom
i
have
assisted
and
redeemed
from
bondage
i
am
no
possessed
of
more
than
two
hundred
acres
of
land
and
three
habitable
dwelling
houses
i
gives
me
joy
to
think
that
i
and
that
i
so
good
a
character
especially
for
and
while
i
am
now
looking
to
the
grave
as
my
home
my
joy
for
this
world
would
be
full
if
my
children
cuff
for
whom
i
paid
two
hundred
dollars
when
