summary
i
introduction
of
the
nations
which
have
contributed
to
the
direct
stream
of
civilization
egypt
and
mesopotamia
are
at
present
believed
to
be
the
oldest
the
chronological
dispute
as
to
the
relative
antiquity
of
the
two
countries
is
of
minor
importance
for
while
in
babylonia
the
historical
material
is
almost
entirely
inscriptional
in
egypt
we
know
the
handicrafts
the
weapons
the
arts
and
to
a
certain
extent
the
religious
beliefs
of
the
race
up
to
a
period
when
it
was
just
emerging
from
the
stone
age
in
a
word
egypt
presents
the
most
ancient
race
whose
manner
of
life
is
known
to
man
from
the
beginning
of
its
history
that
is
from
about
we
can
trace
the
development
of
a
religion
one
of
whose
most
prominent
elements
was
a
promise
of
a
life
after
death
it
was
still
a
great
religion
when
the
christian
doctrine
of
immortality
was
enunciated
in
the
early
centuries
of
the
christian
era
it
seemed
almost
possible
that
the
worship
of
osiris
and
isis
might
become
the
religion
of
the
classical
world
and
the
last
stand
made
by
civilized
paganism
against
christianity
was
in
the
temple
of
isis
at
philae
in
the
sixth
century
after
christ
it
is
clear
that
a
religion
of
such
duration
must
have
offered
some
of
those
consolations
to
man
that
have
marked
all
great
religions
chief
of
which
is
the
faith
in
a
spirit
in
something
that
preserves
the
personality
of
the
man
and
does
not
perish
with
the
body
this
faith
was
in
fact
one
of
the
chief
elements
in
the
egyptian
religion
the
element
best
known
to
us
through
the
endless
cemeteries
which
fill
the
desert
from
one
end
of
egypt
to
the
other
and
through
the
funerary
inscriptions
it
is
necessary
however
to
correct
the
prevailing
impression
that
religion
played
the
greatest
part
in
egyptian
life
or
even
a
greater
part
than
it
does
in
moslem
egypt
the
mistaken
belief
that
death
and
the
of
the
dead
overshadowed
the
existence
of
the
living
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
physical
character
of
the
country
has
preserved
for
us
the
cemeteries
and
the
funerary
temples
better
than
all
the
other
monuments
the
narrow
strip
of
fat
black
land
along
the
nile
produces
generally
its
three
crops
a
year
it
is
much
too
valuable
to
use
as
a
cemetery
but
more
than
that
it
is
subject
to
periodic
saturation
with
water
during
the
inundation
and
is
therefore
unsuitable
for
the
burials
of
a
nation
which
wished
to
preserve
the
contents
of
the
graves
on
the
other
hand
the
desert
which
bounds
this
fertile
strip
so
closely
that
a
dozen
steps
will
usually
carry
one
from
the
black
land
to
the
gray
the
desert
offers
a
dry
preserving
soil
with
absolutely
no
value
to
the
living
thus
all
the
funerary
monuments
were
erected
on
the
desert
and
except
where
intentionally
destroyed
they
are
preserved
to
the
present
day
the
palaces
the
towns
the
farms
and
many
of
the
great
temples
which
were
erected
on
the
black
soil
have
been
pulled
down
for
building
material
or
buried
deep
under
the
steadily
rising
deposits
of
the
nile
the
tombs
of
six
thousand
years
of
dead
have
accumulated
on
the
desert
edge
moreover
our
impression
of
these
tombs
has
been
formed
from
the
monuments
erected
by
kings
princes
priests
and
the
great
and
wealthy
men
of
the
kingdom
the
multitude
of
plain
unadorned
which
the
scientific
excavator
records
by
the
thousands
have
escaped
the
attention
of
scholars
interested
in
egypt
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
comparison
of
religions
it
has
also
been
overlooked
that
the
strikingly
colored
mummies
and
the
glaring
burial
apparatus
of
the
late
period
cost
very
little
to
prepare
the
manufacture
of
mummies
was
a
regular
trade
in
the
ptolemaic
period
at
least
mummy
cases
were
prepared
in
advance
with
blank
spaces
for
the
names
i
do
not
think
that
any
more
expense
was
incurred
in
egyptian
funerals
in
the
dynastic
period
than
is
the
case
among
the
modern
egyptians
the
importance
of
the
funerary
rites
to
the
living
must
therefore
not
be
exaggerated
ii
sources
of
the
material
with
the
exception
of
certain
mythological
explanations
supplied
by
the
inscriptions
and
reliefs
in
the
temples
our
knowledge
of
egyptian
ideas
in
regard
to
the
future
life
is
based
on
funerary
customs
as
revealed
by
excavations
and
on
the
funerary
texts
found
in
the
tombs
these
tombs
always
show
the
same
essential
functions
through
all
changes
of
form
the
protection
of
the
burial
against
decay
and
spoliation
and
the
provision
of
a
where
the
living
may
bring
offerings
to
the
dead
correspondingly
there
are
two
sets
of
customs
burial
customs
and
offering
customs
the
texts
follow
the
same
division
for
the
offering
place
the
texts
are
magical
formulas
which
properly
recited
by
the
living
provide
material
benefit
for
the
dead
for
the
burial
place
the
texts
are
magical
formulas
to
be
used
by
the
spirit
for
its
own
benefit
in
the
difficulties
of
the
spirit
life
these
texts
from
the
burial
chambers
are
found
in
only
a
few
graves
those
of
the
very
great
and
their
contents
show
us
that
they
were
intended
only
for
people
whose
earthly
position
was
exceptional
from
the
funerary
customs
and
the
offering
texts
a
clear
view
is
obtained
of
the
general
conception
the
ordinary
practice
we
see
what
was
regarded
as
absolutely
essential
to
the
belief
of
the
common
man
from
the
texts
found
in
the
burial
chambers
we
get
the
point
of
view
of
the
educated
or
powerful
man
the
things
that
might
be
done
to
gain
for
him
an
exceptional
place
in
the
other
world
both
of
these
classes
of
material
must
be
considered
in
order
to
gain
a
true
idea
of
the
practical
beliefs
for
it
must
be
emphasized
from
the
beginning
that
we
have
in
egypt
several
apparently
conflicting
conceptions
of
immortality
nor
are
we
anywhere
near
obtaining
in
the
case
of
the
texts
the
clearness
necessary
to
understand
fully
all
the
differing
views
held
by
the
priestly
classes
during
a
period
of
over
two
thousand
years
iii
the
ideas
of
the
primitive
race
the
earliest
belief
in
immortality
is
that
which
is
shown
to
us
by
the
burial
customs
of
the
primitive
race
the
prehistoric
egyptian
race
about
we
find
the
egyptian
race
was
just
emerging
from
the
stone
age
all
the
implements
and
weapons
found
are
of
flint
or
other
stone
the
men
of
that
time
were
ignorant
of
writing
but
show
a
certain
facility
in
line
drawings
of
men
plants
and
animals
we
have
found
thousands
of
their
graves
which
all
show
the
same
idea
of
death
each
person
was
buried
with
implements
weapons
ornaments
no
doubt
those
actually
used
in
life
with
a
full
outfit
of
household
pots
and
pans
and
with
a
supply
of
food
the
man
was
dead
but
he
still
needed
the
same
things
he
used
in
ordinary
life
by
a
fortunate
chance
we
have
even
recovered
bodies
accidentally
desiccated
and
preserved
intact
in
the
dry
soil
these
bodies
do
not
show
any
trace
of
mutilation
mummification
or
any
other
preparation
for
the
grave
except
probably
washing
the
dead
body
was
simply
laid
on
a
mat
in
the
grave
covered
with
a
cloth
and
a
mat
or
a
skin
and
then
with
clean
gravel
but
with
it
was
placed
all
those
things
which
the
man
might
need
if
his
life
were
to
go
on
in
some
mysterious
unseen
way
as
life
went
on
among
those
on
earth
possibly
his
relations
as
in
later
times
brought
offerings
of
food
to
the
grave
but
here
even
the
dry
soil
of
egypt
fails
to
furnish
positive
evidence
all
this
shows
a
plain
simple
belief
in
the
persistence
of
the
life
of
a
man
as
distinguished
from
the
body
a
belief
widely
prevalent
among
primitive
people
it
contains
nothing
unusual
and
is
probably
perfectly
explicable
psychologically
by
means
of
dreams
there
is
little
or
no
change
in
this
underlying
belief
to
be
observed
in
the
burial
customs
of
the
egyptians
during
the
late
predynastic
period
copper
weapons
and
implements
succeed
stone
in
the
graves
all
those
objects
in
whose
manufacture
the
new
tools
are
used
show
changes
of
technique
and
form
it
is
even
curious
to
note
that
some
of
the
older
stone
and
flint
objects
some
of
the
older
pots
and
pans
are
still
made
as
a
matter
of
tradition
the
importance
of
this
is
not
to
be
overlooked
for
centuries
men
had
used
flint
knives
and
they
had
baked
their
bread
in
flat
mud
saucers
set
in
the
ashes
for
the
centuries
these
flint
knives
and
these
cakes
with
their
saucers
had
been
placed
in
the
graves
gradually
metal
knives
and
better
bread
pans
displaced
these
more
primitive
objects
in
daily
life
but
the
older
primitive
objects
were
still
placed
in
the
graves
as
a
matter
of
tradition
it
must
be
remembered
of
course
that
these
traditional
objects
were
also
in
use
in
ancient
traditional
ceremonies
on
earth
the
sacrificial
animals
were
still
slaughtered
with
flint
knives
the
cakes
were
still
offered
in
the
holy
places
in
other
words
life
on
earth
now
consisted
of
ordinary
material
life
and
a
traditional
life
a
life
that
clung
to
the
forms
of
a
more
primitive
civilization
as
somehow
more
effective
with
the
divine
powers
this
view
is
closely
reflected
in
the
grave
furniture
here
too
were
the
practical
objects
and
the
traditional
ceremonial
objects
life
after
death
is
still
always
the
same
as
life
on
earth
with
the
same
physical
needs
with
the
same
need
of
help
from
supernatural
powers
or
against
supernatural
powers
the
spirit
of
the
man
needed
the
spirit
of
the
copper
axe
to
swing
in
battle
but
just
as
much
he
needed
the
spirit
of
the
flint
knife
to
make
the
first
cut
across
the
throat
of
the
spirit
bull
of
sacrifice
remember
this
the
other
world
in
which
lived
the
spirit
of
the
dead
was
filled
with
the
spirits
or
ghosts
of
all
things
and
animals
the
other
the
unseen
was
a
duplicate
of
this
world
all
things
which
have
shape
were
there
even
to
the
black
fields
and
the
broad
river
of
egypt
this
is
the
foundation
of
the
egyptian
conception
of
immortality
through
all
the
modifications
and
accretions
of
the
following
three
thousand
years
this
foundation
idea
is
always
clearly
visible
all
the
statues
the
carved
and
painted
tombs
all
the
curious
little
model
boats
and
workshops
all
the
painted
mummies
all
the
amulets
the
scarabs
the
little
funerary
statuettes
all
this
mummery
which
seems
to
be
so
characteristic
and
so
essential
is
only
the
means
to
an
end
and
an
ever
changing
means
to
secure
a
successful
comfortable
existence
of
the
spirit
in
the
life
after
death
in
the
ghostly
duplicate
of
life
on
earth
iv
the
early
dynastic
period
it
is
clear
that
the
effort
to
attain
an
immortality
which
is
merely
a
ghostly
continuation
of
life
on
earth
must
reflect
the
general
development
of
egyptian
culture
especially
the
advance
in
arts
and
crafts
one
of
the
most
striking
examples
of
this
fact
is
the
introduction
of
metal
working
mentioned
above
and
the
consequent
placing
of
both
flint
and
copper
in
the
grave
the
division
of
grave
furniture
into
practical
objects
and
ceremonial
objects
which
is
the
foundation
for
the
use
of
symbolic
objects
in
later
times
the
advance
in
arts
and
crafts
not
only
suggests
new
ideas
of
the
necessities
of
the
spirit
but
it
provides
the
necessary
technical
skill
for
the
more
effective
satisfaction
of
all
the
needs
of
the
dead
this
takes
first
of
all
the
form
of
supplying
a
place
for
the
burial
which
furnishes
greater
security
to
the
body
and
a
better
communication
between
the
living
and
the
dead
from
the
first
dynasty
say
from
down
as
soon
as
the
egyptian
had
mastered
the
use
of
and
wood
we
gain
the
certainty
of
an
idea
which
could
only
be
guessed
at
in
the
primitive
period
a
place
is
provided
above
the
grave
at
which
the
living
could
meet
the
spirit
of
the
dead
with
offerings
of
food
and
other
necessities
in
the
life
after
death
spirit
food
and
drink
once
used
ceased
to
be
just
as
in
life
on
earth
and
had
to
be
renewed
from
day
to
day
lest
the
spirit
of
the
dead
suffer
from
hunger
and
thirst
one
of
the
great
developments
of
the
first
six
dynasties
looked
to
the
provision
of
these
daily
necessities
the
invention
of
writing
was
immediately
utilized
about
the
beginning
of
the
first
dynasty
writing
was
invented
for
administrative
and
other
practical
purposes
gravestones
bearing
in
relief
the
name
of
the
dead
were
set
up
in
the
offering
places
of
the
kings
and
court
people
these
were
probably
reminders
for
use
in
some
simple
formula
recited
in
presenting
the
periodical
offerings
as
the
egyptians
became
more
familiar
with
the
use
of
writing
the
offering
formula
was
written
out
in
full
enlarged
and
modified
sculptures
both
relief
and
statuary
in
every
stage
of
their
development
were
used
as
magical
accessories
to
the
offering
rites
so
also
the
whole
history
of
egyptian
architecture
was
reflected
in
the
tomb
for
every
advance
brought
about
some
change
in
the
form
or
structure
in
fact
the
whole
development
of
the
form
of
the
egyptian
tomb
depended
on
the
development
of
technical
skill
the
same
funerary
functions
are
served
throughout
as
all
the
great
artisans
were
at
the
command
of
the
king
all
the
great
technical
discoveries
and
inventions
were
first
made
in
his
service
but
every
permanent
gain
in
knowledge
was
a
benefit
to
the
race
and
utilized
by
the
common
people
so
for
example
the
skill
acquired
in
during
the
construction
of
the
great
pyramids
was
utilized
a
little
later
in
producing
tombs
from
one
end
of
egypt
to
the
other
the
functions
of
the
grave
remained
the
same
yet
with
the
changes
in
form
resulting
from
the
growth
of
skill
modifications
in
the
funerary
customs
crept
in
the
tombs
of
the
early
part
of
the
first
dynasty
like
the
graves
had
only
one
chamber
limited
in
size
by
the
length
of
logs
obtainable
to
form
the
roof
the
growing
desire
for
ostentation
found
a
way
to
enlarge
the
tombs
by
building
them
with
a
number
of
chambers
the
burial
was
placed
in
the
central
chamber
and
the
burial
furniture
in
the
additional
chambers
in
this
way
the
separation
of
the
furniture
and
the
actual
burial
was
brought
about
the
old
empire
another
change
comes
in
the
fourth
dynasty
and
is
to
be
noted
first
in
the
royal
tombs
as
is
always
the
case
the
egyptians
had
now
learned
to
cut
stone
and
build
with
it
the
burial
chambers
hollowed
in
the
solid
rock
were
necessarily
smaller
than
the
old
chambers
dug
in
the
gravel
and
no
longer
sufficient
to
contain
the
great
mass
of
furniture
gathered
by
a
king
for
his
grave
on
the
other
hand
the
chapels
with
the
increase
in
architectural
skill
could
be
build
of
great
size
corresponding
to
these
technical
conditions
we
find
a
great
increase
in
the
importance
of
the
chapel
it
becomes
a
great
temple
whose
magazines
were
filled
with
all
those
objects
which
had
formerly
been
placed
in
the
burial
chamber
and
were
so
necessary
to
the
life
of
the
spirit
the
temples
of
the
third
pyramid
for
example
contained
nearly
two
thousand
stone
vessels
great
estates
were
set
aside
by
will
and
the
income
appointed
to
the
support
of
certain
persons
who
on
their
side
were
obliged
to
keep
up
the
temple
to
make
the
offerings
and
to
recite
the
magical
formulas
which
would
provide
the
spirit
with
all
its
necessities
following
closely
the
growth
in
importance
of
the
royal
chapels
the
private
offering
places
assumed
a
greater
importance
the
custom
of
periodic
offerings
and
the
use
of
magical
texts
grew
until
it
reached
its
highest
point
in
the
fifth
dynasty
at
this
time
there
is
a
burial
chamber
deep
underground
where
the
dead
was
laid
securely
in
ancient
traditional
attitude
with
his
clothing
and
a
few
personal
ornaments
as
a
rule
it
is
only
the
women
always
conservative
that
have
anything
more
above
this
grave
there
is
a
solid
rectangular
structure
with
a
chapel
or
offering
place
on
the
side
towards
the
valley
the
offering
place
is
always
there
no
matter
how
poor
or
small
the
tomb
but
to
understand
just
what
the
egyptian
thought
we
must
turn
to
the
better
tombs
the
walls
are
of
limestone
carved
with
reliefs
representing
the
important
processes
of
daily
life
sowing
reaping
hunting
weaving
all
those
actions
which
furnish
the
daily
supplies
the
dead
man
is
represented
overseeing
all
this
finally
near
the
offering
niche
he
is
represented
seated
usually
with
his
wife
at
a
table
bearing
loaves
of
the
traditional
bread
beside
him
are
represented
heaps
of
provisions
meat
cakes
vegetables
wine
and
beer
a
list
of
objects
is
never
missing
marked
with
numbers
a
thousand
loaves
of
bread
a
thousand
head
of
cattle
a
thousand
jars
of
wine
a
thousand
garments
and
so
on
we
know
from
latter
inscriptions
that
these
words
properly
recited
created
for
the
spirit
a
store
of
spirit
objects
in
equal
numbers
below
the
niche
is
an
altar
for
receiving
actual
offerings
of
food
and
drink
it
is
clear
that
the
living
coming
to
this
offering
place
with
or
without
material
offerings
could
by
proper
recitation
secure
to
the
spirit
of
the
dead
all
its
daily
needs
this
offering
niche
is
the
door
of
the
other
world
symbolically
and
actually
in
many
graves
the
niche
is
carved
to
represent
a
door
sometimes
opening
in
and
sometimes
opening
out
moreover
in
several
cases
the
figure
of
the
dead
is
carved
half
emerging
from
the
opening
door
a
figure
in
all
ways
like
the
figure
of
the
dead
as
he
is
represented
in
the
scenes
from
life
beyond
this
door
lives
the
spirit
of
the
dead
in
many
offering
chambers
there
is
a
small
hole
in
the
wall
either
in
the
offering
niche
or
in
another
place
if
this
hole
be
properly
lighted
and
the
space
beyond
has
not
been
changed
by
decay
or
violation
the
light
falls
on
the
face
of
a
statue
of
the
dead
looking
forth
to
the
world
of
the
living
for
behind
the
wall
is
another
chamber
closed
except
for
this
small
hole
this
hidden
chamber
contains
statues
of
the
dead
often
accompanied
by
statues
of
his
family
and
his
servants
these
statues
of
the
dead
are
labeled
with
his
name
and
are
said
to
be
the
abode
of
his
spirit
his
as
the
egyptians
called
it
moreover
all
the
offering
formulas
named
the
as
the
recipient
of
the
food
and
drink
the
duplicate
spirit
of
the
man
is
his
in
these
statues
we
have
then
a
simulacrum
of
the
man
provided
for
use
of
his
perhaps
to
assist
the
to
the
persistence
of
his
earthly
form
and
to
the
remembrance
of
his
name
but
what
were
the
uses
of
the
subsidiary
statues
what
spirit
resided
in
them
the
man
son
in
his
turn
died
and
a
similar
room
was
made
for
him
with
his
statue
and
his
subsidiary
statues
did
his
live
both
in
the
statue
placed
with
his
father
statue
and
also
in
the
statue
in
his
own
grave
we
have
no
answer
probably
the
egyptian
mind
never
formulated
the
difficulty
but
the
new
idea
is
clearly
expressed
it
is
no
longer
necessary
to
fill
the
burial
chamber
with
a
mass
of
household
furniture
for
the
use
of
the
dead
all
these
things
can
be
carved
on
the
wall
of
the
burial
chamber
and
so
made
effective
for
his
use
it
was
in
any
case
necessary
to
supply
his
food
by
means
of
the
offerings
and
it
was
quite
as
easy
to
supply
all
his
other
necessities
in
the
same
way
in
other
words
there
is
a
distinct
growth
in
the
use
of
magic
to
benefit
the
dead
at
the
same
time
we
find
the
growth
of
the
custom
of
supplying
a
special
abode
for
the
a
simulacrum
of
the
man
which
assisted
the
to
retain
the
form
of
the
living
man
and
to
remember
his
identity
the
tendency
of
this
period
is
then
to
place
a
greater
dependence
on
magic
than
on
food
drink
and
grave
furniture
it
is
therefore
not
surprising
to
find
introduced
for
the
first
time
the
use
of
magical
texts
in
the
burial
chamber
the
pyramid
texts
in
the
burial
chamber
in
the
pyramid
of
unas
last
king
of
the
fifth
dynasty
and
in
the
pyramids
of
the
kings
of
the
sixth
dynasty
the
walls
are
covered
with
long
magical
texts
or
chapters
the
oldest
form
of
the
book
of
the
dead
or
book
of
the
going
forth
by
day
the
texts
were
probably
somewhat
older
but
are
now
used
for
the
first
time
in
this
manner
no
doubt
owing
to
the
increased
facility
in
carving
stone
in
these
the
various
powers
of
the
other
world
are
invoked
by
the
incidents
of
the
legend
to
preserve
the
dead
body
to
feed
the
and
to
assist
the
other
spirit
the
in
its
struggles
with
supernatural
powers
the
pyramid
texts
introduce
us
to
three
important
ideas
a
curious
plurality
of
the
spirit
existence
a
condition
of
immortality
better
than
that
of
the
old
underworld
or
earu
and
most
important
of
all
the
identification
of
the
king
with
osiris
according
to
the
terms
of
the
legend
in
all
the
older
offering
formulas
it
is
only
the
spirit
which
is
mentioned
here
is
the
body
perishable
and
destructible
here
is
the
life
the
which
fills
every
limb
and
vessel
of
the
body
and
must
therefore
have
the
same
form
when
death
comes
the
spirit
the
image
of
the
man
remains
near
the
body
and
this
spirit
it
was
which
was
the
object
of
the
rites
and
offerings
in
the
funerary
chapel
but
besides
this
it
appears
for
the
first
time
that
the
king
at
any
rate
possesses
also
a
soul
called
a
in
later
times
we
see
that
every
man
possessed
a
and
we
learn
that
each
god
possessed
several
but
it
is
in
the
pyramid
texts
that
we
learn
for
the
first
time
of
the
of
a
man
and
that
man
is
a
king
when
death
comes
the
takes
flight
in
the
form
of
a
bird
or
whatever
form
it
wills
all
seems
confused
the
was
near
the
body
the
was
in
the
field
of
earu
under
the
earth
ploughing
and
sowing
the
is
fluttering
on
the
branches
of
the
tree
on
earth
the
has
fled
like
a
falcon
to
the
heavens
and
has
been
set
as
a
star
among
the
stars
the
dead
king
lives
with
the
gods
and
is
fed
by
them
the
goddesses
give
him
the
breast
he
lives
in
the
island
of
food
he
lives
in
earu
the
underworld
a
land
like
egypt
with
fields
and
canals
and
flood
and
harvest
he
shares
with
the
gods
in
the
offerings
made
in
the
great
temples
on
earth
it
is
quite
clear
that
all
this
is
an
expression
of
dissatisfaction
with
the
old
belief
in
the
simple
duplicate
world
the
world
of
earu
under
the
earth
it
is
noteworthy
that
this
first
appears
in
royal
tombs
these
texts
are
written
for
kings
alone
it
is
only
many
centuries
later
that
the
texts
of
the
book
of
the
dead
showed
similar
possibilities
open
to
the
common
man
this
is
the
usual
course
of
all
advances
in
egypt
architecture
sculpture
writing
whatever
gain
in
skill
or
knowledge
there
is
appears
first
in
the
service
of
the
royal
family
thus
even
in
the
conception
of
immortality
the
new
ideas
the
better
immortality
was
first
thought
out
for
the
benefit
of
the
king
the
basis
for
this
lay
simply
in
the
life
on
earth
the
king
had
come
early
to
have
a
sort
of
divinity
ascribed
to
him
his
chief
name
was
the
horus
name
menes
was
the
horus
aha
cheops
was
the
horus
mejeru
pepy
ii
was
the
horus
but
he
was
also
the
son
of
ra
the
endued
with
life
forever
the
king
was
a
god
and
it
could
only
be
that
in
his
future
life
he
shared
the
life
of
the
gods
thus
all
is
no
more
confused
or
mysterious
than
is
the
conception
of
the
life
of
the
gods
themselves
but
the
texts
go
even
further
than
this
and
identify
the
dead
who
as
horus
was
king
on
earth
with
the
father
of
horus
the
dead
god
of
the
earth
osiris
this
identification
of
the
dead
man
with
the
dead
god
osiris
was
later
enlarged
to
include
all
men
and
became
in
the
ptolemaic
period
the
most
characteristic
feature
of
the
egyptian
conception
of
life
after
death
the
osiris
story
as
it
can
be
pieced
together
from
the
pyramid
texts
see
erman
aegyptische
ff
was
briefly
thus
keb
the
and
nut
the
goddess
of
the
sky
had
four
children
osiris
and
isis
seth
and
nephthys
who
were
thus
paired
in
marriage
keb
gave
osiris
his
dominion
the
earth
and
made
him
the
god
of
the
earth
and
he
ruled
justly
and
powerfully
seth
his
brother
was
jealous
and
by
treachery
enticed
osiris
into
a
box
which
he
closed
and
threw
into
the
water
isis
sought
for
the
body
of
her
husband
until
she
found
it
and
isis
and
nephthys
her
sister
sat
at
his
head
and
feet
and
bewailed
him
re
the
greatest
of
the
gods
heard
complaint
his
heart
was
touched
and
he
sent
anubis
to
bury
osiris
anubis
his
separated
bones
bound
him
with
cloths
and
prepared
him
for
burial
that
is
mummified
him
this
is
the
form
in
which
osiris
is
represented
as
a
mummy
isis
then
fanned
her
wings
and
the
air
from
her
wings
caused
the
mummy
to
live
his
life
on
earth
however
was
over
could
not
be
recalled
so
that
his
new
life
could
only
be
passed
in
the
other
world
the
world
of
the
dead
here
osiris
became
king
as
he
had
been
king
on
earth
but
isis
conceived
from
the
osiris
bore
a
child
in
secret
and
suckled
him
hidden
in
a
swamp
when
the
child
the
horus
grew
up
he
fought
against
seth
to
recover
his
father
kingdom
and
to
avenge
his
death
both
gods
were
injured
in
the
fight
horus
lost
an
eye
but
thoth
intervened
separated
the
fighters
and
healed
their
wounds
thoth
spat
upon
the
eye
of
horus
and
it
became
whole
horus
however
gave
his
eye
to
osiris
to
eat
and
thereby
osiris
became
endowed
with
life
soul
and
power
in
the
underworld
but
seth
disputed
the
legitimacy
of
the
birth
of
horus
and
the
great
gods
held
a
court
in
the
house
of
keb
in
this
court
justice
was
done
the
truth
of
horus
claims
was
established
and
he
was
placed
on
the
throne
of
his
father
osiris
became
the
ruler
in
the
land
of
the
dead
horus
in
the
land
of
the
living
the
kernel
of
the
story
appears
to
be
this
osiris
is
the
god
of
the
earth
and
his
life
is
the
life
of
the
vegetation
dying
and
reviving
with
the
course
of
the
seasons
mourned
by
his
wife
isis
and
succeeded
by
his
son
horus
the
it
is
apparently
a
form
of
the
common
tammuz
or
adonis
story
of
the
semites
this
fact
brings
with
it
a
suggestion
which
requires
consideration
the
racial
connection
of
the
egyptians
may
seem
to
have
little
to
do
with
immortality
but
i
beg
a
moment
consideration
the
two
great
dominating
ideas
of
immortality
are
those
held
by
the
christians
and
by
the
mohammedans
and
these
are
essentially
the
same
idea
both
these
religions
are
creations
of
the
semitic
race
it
is
therefore
decidedly
of
importance
to
find
that
the
egyptian
race
the
creator
of
a
third
great
religion
has
also
a
large
semitic
strain
in
fact
the
investigations
of
the
last
ten
years
appear
to
show
that
this
semitic
strain
it
was
which
gave
the
egyptian
race
its
creative
power
and
made
possible
the
development
of
the
egyptian
civilization
the
egyptian
language
furnishes
us
with
indisputable
proof
of
the
semitic
affinity
as
professor
adolf
erman
showed
years
ago
the
anatomical
examination
by
professor
elliot
smith
of
a
large
number
of
skeletons
dated
by
careful
excavations
has
given
us
a
further
clue
there
is
a
prehistoric
race
found
in
the
earliest
cemeteries
neither
negroid
nor
asiatic
in
characteristics
in
the
late
predynastic
and
the
early
dynastic
periods
when
the
great
development
began
this
primitive
race
had
become
modified
by
an
infiltration
of
people
from
the
north
in
the
old
empire
this
people
had
become
predominant
and
remain
so
throughout
all
lower
and
middle
egypt
until
the
present
day
this
intruding
race
whose
advent
marks
the
beginning
of
egyptian
civilization
i
believe
to
have
been
semitic
remember
this
the
texts
show
clearly
older
ideas
in
conflict
with
the
osiris
belief
the
primitive
race
was
not
i
believe
a
race
of
osiris
followers
professor
erman
has
stated
that
the
osiris
belief
is
as
early
as
that
i
am
certain
is
absolutely
untenable
it
is
a
question
of
egyptian
chronology
in
which
i
beg
to
differ
radically
both
from
eduard
meyer
and
professor
erman
in
the
formal
calendar
year
of
three
hundred
and
days
there
are
twelve
months
of
thirty
days
and
five
intercalary
days
these
intercalary
days
are
called
the
birthdays
of
osiris
horus
seth
isis
and
nephthys
the
five
most
important
figures
in
the
osiris
myth
according
to
professor
meyer
and
professor
erman
this
formal
calendar
was
introduced
in
one
of
the
occasions
when
the
heliacal
rising
of
the
star
sothis
fell
on
the
first
of
the
month
thoth
of
the
calendar
however
if
we
accept
with
them
the
date
as
the
date
of
the
first
dynasty
then
in
the
egyptians
were
just
emerging
from
a
neolithic
state
they
were
culturally
incapable
of
making
a
formal
calendar
and
could
have
no
possible
use
for
one
either
the
calendar
did
not
originate
in
egypt
or
it
was
introduced
in
when
again
the
heliacal
rising
sothis
fell
on
the
first
of
thoth
at
this
time
the
osiris
story
was
dominant
in
the
religion
we
have
a
race
almost
certainly
semitic
fusing
the
primitive
race
during
the
period
and
a
few
centuries
later
we
have
a
new
religious
idea
dominating
the
fused
race
when
we
examine
this
new
idea
the
osiris
belief
we
find
its
earliest
form
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
common
tammuz
or
adonis
story
of
the
semites
the
conclusion
lies
very
near
at
hand
that
the
osiris
story
is
in
fact
the
tammuz
story
brought
into
egypt
by
the
earliest
semitic
tribes
in
any
case
it
was
a
race
with
a
large
semitic
mixture
which
utilized
this
story
in
working
out
a
theory
of
immortality
and
in
all
probability
we
have
in
the
religion
a
third
great
religion
due
to
the
semitic
race
however
this
may
be
it
is
clear
that
the
craving
of
the
king
for
a
special
immortality
for
an
exalted
future
life
found
its
justification
through
the
myth
horus
was
the
successor
of
osiris
as
lord
of
the
earth
and
the
living
the
kings
of
egypt
were
the
successors
of
horus
the
chief
name
of
the
king
was
his
horus
name
menes
was
the
horus
aha
cheops
the
horus
mejeru
when
the
king
died
he
became
osiris
and
passed
to
the
kingdom
of
osiris
he
passed
through
the
underworld
with
the
abode
there
as
osiris
the
or
sped
to
the
heavens
to
the
celestial
gods
thus
comes
the
entering
wedge
of
a
great
change
in
the
conception
of
immortality
an
ordinary
immortality
for
the
common
man
a
special
divine
immortality
for
the
divine
man
the
king
it
appears
probable
that
the
deification
of
the
king
and
the
assumption
of
a
divine
immortality
for
him
was
prior
in
time
to
the
statement
of
these
beliefs
in
the
terms
of
the
osiris
story
even
at
this
early
age
it
was
of
course
clearly
stated
that
the
king
must
be
righteous
morally
satisfactory
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
and
of
the
gods
the
gods
as
always
were
on
the
side
of
the
moral
code
and
especially
on
the
side
of
the
organized
religion
it
is
perhaps
significant
that
the
chief
sins
of
the
kings
of
the
fourth
dynasty
so
execrated
by
the
egyptian
priests
in
the
ptolemaic
period
were
sins
against
the
great
gods
the
other
charges
are
for
the
most
part
plainly
slanders
in
practice
every
king
whose
family
remained
in
power
was
justified
before
gods
and
men
and
took
his
place
among
the
gods
in
the
islands
of
the
blessed
in
the
northern
part
of
the
heavens
the
dead
body
was
laid
in
the
grave
supplied
with
all
these
magic
texts
which
were
to
restore
and
revive
the
soul
and
guide
it
across
waters
and
through
dangers
to
the
place
of
osiris
but
the
chapel
was
not
wanting
the
cult
of
the
was
maintained
the
statues
were
placed
in
the
hidden
room
the
food
and
drink
were
brought
daily
to
the
door
of
the
grave
thus
while
a
special
immortality
was
evolved
for
the
king
the
funeral
customs
continue
to
show
the
same
service
of
the
as
in
the
earlier
period
in
the
sixth
dynasty
there
is
a
return
to
the
older
practice
of
placing
objects
in
the
grave
itself
at
present
we
are
unable
to
point
out
the
reasons
for
this
possibly
experience
had
taught
men
that
endowments
and
craved
walls
left
to
the
care
of
descendants
were
insecure
supports
for
a
life
after
death
which
was
to
last
forever
at
any
rate
the
custom
arose
of
making
small
models
in
wood
or
stone
or
metal
of
those
scenes
and
objects
which
were
carved
in
relief
on
the
walls
of
the
chapel
models
of
houses
granaries
of
kitchens
of
brickyards
models
of
herds
and
servants
and
soldiers
models
of
boats
and
ships
models
of
with
the
man
seated
drinking
wine
around
him
musicians
before
him
dancing
girls
models
of
swords
of
vessels
of
implements
poorer
people
must
be
contented
with
poorer
things
down
to
the
peasant
who
is
buried
with
the
few
little
necessary
pots
and
pans
of
his
daily
life
but
always
in
every
grave
the
chapel
small
or
great
is
there
the
endowment
of
funerary
priests
continues
every
man
i
suppose
however
poor
had
some
one
to
make
at
least
one
offering
at
his
grave
and
so
it
was
down
to
the
new
empire
vi
the
middle
empire
during
the
middle
empire
the
burial
and
offering
customs
show
the
persistence
of
the
old
belief
in
life
after
death
as
on
earth
pots
vessels
tools
weapons
ornaments
clothing
and
models
of
scenes
from
life
continue
to
be
placed
in
the
burial
chamber
the
walls
of
the
offering
chambers
of
the
nobles
at
this
time
cut
in
the
rock
still
bear
representations
from
life
carved
in
relief
the
symbolical
doors
and
the
offering
formulas
still
mark
the
spot
where
the
dead
receive
the
necessities
of
life
from
the
living
all
graves
of
every
class
testify
to
the
faith
in
a
life
after
death
similar
to
life
on
earth
yet
certain
modifications
are
apparent
which
are
significant
for
the
future
development
of
the
conception
of
immortality
the
pyramid
texts
are
used
by
the
provincial
nobles
for
their
own
benefit
abydos
assumes
a
great
importance
as
the
burial
place
of
osiris
the
swathed
mummy
comes
into
general
use
in
burials
the
first
identification
of
the
king
with
osiris
in
the
pyramid
texts
marks
the
conception
of
a
better
immortality
for
him
so
as
the
possibility
of
a
better
immortality
was
claimed
by
wider
and
wider
circles
of
men
the
use
of
the
pyramid
texts
or
similar
texts
also
became
wider
in
the
middle
empire
texts
practically
identical
with
the
pyramid
texts
but
furnished
with
illustrations
somewhat
like
those
of
the
later
books
of
the
dead
are
found
in
the
coffins
of
provincial
nobles
the
power
of
the
monarchy
had
been
weakening
during
the
fifth
and
sixth
dynasties
partly
owing
to
the
dissipation
of
national
resources
by
royal
extravagance
partly
owing
to
other
causes
after
the
sixth
dynasty
the
country
was
clearly
in
a
period
of
economic
depression
and
the
government
was
broken
up
into
a
series
of
nearly
independent
baronies
corresponding
roughly
to
the
later
division
into
provinces
or
nomes
our
material
is
scanty
the
tombs
of
very
few
great
men
have
been
found
but
when
in
the
twelfth
dynasty
an
abundance
of
material
is
at
hand
we
see
alongside
the
old
forms
of
the
burial
customs
the
use
of
the
pyramid
texts
on
the
inside
walls
of
the
coffins
of
the
great
man
it
was
now
possible
for
the
of
the
great
landed
noble
to
seek
refuge
with
the
gods
in
the
northwest
heavens
and
share
their
life
the
increasing
importance
of
abydos
as
the
burial
place
of
osiris
is
of
still
greater
significance
the
tomb
of
a
king
of
the
first
dynasty
was
identified
by
the
priests
as
the
actual
burial
place
of
osiris
many
great
people
made
graves
for
themselves
in
the
same
field
or
if
they
lived
at
a
distance
built
empty
cenotaphs
there
a
great
temple
of
osiris
stood
near
by
and
became
the
centre
of
the
celebration
of
mysteries
illustrating
the
death
and
revival
of
osiris
fortunately
a
certain
high
official
named
has
left
us
an
account
of
the
osiris
as
performed
under
his
oversight
in
the
nineteenth
year
of
sesostris
iii
nearly
two
thousand
years
before

the
play
began
by
the
procession
of
the
statue
of
the
the
going
forth
to
help
his
father
osiris
then
the
statue
of
osiris
himself
in
the
neshemet
boat
came
forth
as
triumphant
king
of
the
earth
sham
battles
took
place
referring
to
the
conquest
of
the
earth
by
osiris
these
processions
were
only
introductory
the
principal
procession
took
place
on
the
following
day
or
days
when
osiris
went
forth
to
his
death
at
nedit
the
actual
death
scene
certainly
took
place
in
secret
but
when
the
dead
body
was
found
the
multitude
joined
in
the
wailing
and
the
lamentations
the
god
thoth
went
forth
in
a
boat
and
brought
back
the
body
of
osiris
the
body
was
prepared
for
burial
and
taken
in
funeral
procession
to
the
grave
at
peker
osiris
was
avenged
on
his
enemies
in
a
great
battle

at

finally
the
god
his
life
revived
comes
from
peker
in
triumphant
procession
and
enters
his
temple
at
abydos
osiris
mysteries
were
celebrated
at
other
places
at
least
in
later
times
and
perhaps
even
in
the
middle
empire
but
it
is
not
easy
to
discern
the
part
these
mysteries
played
in
the
middle
empire
in
the
beliefs
of
the
common
people
regarding
their
immortality
the
osiris
story
was
one
of
the
most
widespread
in
egypt
and
powerful
in
its
effect
on
the
feelings
of
all
classes
was
certain
sooner
or
later
to
prepare
the
way
for
a
general
belief
in
a
better
immortality
but
if
we
may
judge
from
the
burial
customs
the
great
mass
of
the
people
still
believed
merely
in
an
underworld
earu
a
duplicate
of
the
earthly
life
but
with
greater
possibilities
of
danger
and
evil
during
the
course
of
egyptian
history
the
position
in
which
the
body
is
buried
undergoes
a
series
of
remarkable
changes
during
the
early
period
the
body
loosely
enfolded
in
cloths
and
skins
is
laid
in
the
grave
double
up
on
the
left
side
with
the
head
south
upstream
this
position
becomes
the
custom
with
very
few
exceptions
during
the
late
predynastic
period
and
the
first
three
dynasties
throughout
the
fourth
to
sixth
dynasties
the
body
was
in
the
same
position
but
with
the
head
north
loosely
covered
with
shawls
and
garments
the
crouching
position
with
some
slight
modifications
continues
to
be
used
for
the
poorest
class
down
to
the
new
empire
among
the
nubians
it
is
universal
to
the
new
empire
and
customary
even
later
in
unmixed
nubian
communities
the
swathed
extended
burials
begin
in
egypt
in
the
fourth
dynasty
so
far
as
remains
are
preserved
some
members
of
the
royal
family
of
cheops
were
buried
in
swathed
wrapping
lying
extended
on
the
left
side
with
the
knees
bent
during
the
fifth
and
sixth
dynasties
this
extended
position
on
the
side
becomes
customary
for
the
better
classes
and
during
the
middle
empire
it
becomes
almost
universal
the
final
burial
position
the
swathed
mummy
lying
extended
on
the
back
does
not
become
general
until
the
new
empire
about
although
it
is
the
position
hitherto
regarded
as
the
characteristic
egyptian
burial
position
a
few
isolated
cases
some
of
them
perhaps
accidental
occur
as
early
as
the
old
empire
but
in
the
new
empire
the
extended
burial
on
the
back
is
practically
the
only
one
to
be
observed
in
other
words
beginning
in
the
predynastic
period
with
a
burial
position
which
may
be
called
natural
and
primitive
the
egyptian
gradually
adopted
a
position
which
imitated
the
form
of
the
dead
osiris
the
god
of
the
dead
each
new
change
is
first
adopted
by
the
royal
family
and
is
taken
up
by
the
other
classes
in
turn
until
it
becomes
universal
in
the
final
form
the
mummy
was
a
simulacrum
of
the
dead
as
osiris
alongside
these
changes
in
the
burial
position
progressed
the
art
of
preserving
the
body
the
earliest
attempts
were
made
on
the
body
of
the
king
and
the
knowledge
of
embalming
gained
in
preserving
his
body
was
gradually
utilized
for
the
higher
classes
and
finally
for
all
but
the
poorest
it
seems
indisputable
that
the
royal
personages
of
the
fourth
and
sixth
dynasties
were
mummified
the
entrails
were
drawn
the
body
prepared
with
spices
and
resins
and
wrapped
tightly
in
cloths
smeared
with
resin
but
the
mummies
of
the
nobles
even
of
this
period
show
no
trace
of
such
treatment
the
receptacles
for
the
viscera
are
sometimes
found
in
their
graves
in
the
sixth
dynasty
but
are
as
a
rule
empty
being
mere
dummy
vases
even
in
the
middle
empire
the
preservation
of
the
bodies
of
the
better
classes
was
extremely
imperfect
the
bundles
of
wrappings
have
kept
their
form
to
the
present
day
and
it
seems
as
if
the
mummy
were
still
intact
but
an
examination
of
the
interior
shows
only
loose
bones
successful
mummification
appears
among
people
in
the
new
empire
for
the
first
time
and
becomes
a
general
custom
in
the
late
period
the
processes
of
successful
mummification
necessitated
the
practical
destruction
of
the
body
in
the
middle
empire
which
is
the
period
under
discussion
the
process
of
mummification
had
reached
a
middle
stage
and
while
we
are
unable
to
explain
exactly
the
causal
relationship
it
is
clear
that
this
advance
in
the
treatment
of
the
body
accompanied
a
spread
of
the
belief
in
the
osirian
immortality
vii
the
new
empire
the
new
empire
was
the
great
period
of
foreign
conquest
the
hyksos
asiatic
invaders
had
held
egypt
for
a
century
or
more
the
theban
princes
who
drove
them
out
became
kings
of
egypt
and
followed
them
into
asia
with
an
army
trained
in
war
by
the
long
struggle
with
the
hyksos
the
egyptian
kings
having
tasted
the
sweetness
of
the
spoils
of
war
entered
on
the
conquest
of
western
asia
and
the
sudan
the
plunder
of
both
these
regions
poured
into
egypt
under
thothmes
iii
an
annual
campaign
was
conducted
into
syria
to
bring
back
the
spoils
and
the
tribute
foreign
slaves
and
the
products
of
foreign
handicraft
were
for
sale
in
every
the
treasury
was
filled
to
overflowing
a
large
share
was
assigned
to
amon
the
god
of
the
theban
family
temples
were
built
for
him
estates
established
for
the
maintenance
of
his
rites
thousands
of
priests
enrolled
for
the
service
of
his
properties
the
god
became
in
a
material
sense
the
greatest
god
of
egypt
the
national
god
and
his
priesthood
became
the
most
powerful
organization
in
the
kingdom
the
high
priest
of
amon
usurped
the
power
of
the
king
and
finally
supplanted
him
such
was
the
period
in
which
the
next
great
development
of
the
egyptian
idea
of
immortality
is
to
be
noted
a
period
of
priestly
activity
in
the
beginning
and
of
priestly
domination
in
the
end
the
priests
are
the
scribes
the
men
of
learning
they
have
the
lore
of
all
magic
medicine
rules
of
conduct
religious
rites
it
is
not
mere
chance
therefore
that
the
new
empire
was
marked
by
a
great
increase
of
magic
in
all
its
forms
texts
and
symbolic
objects
and
by
a
great
development
in
the
knowledge
of
the
other
world
in
some
of
the
texts
the
geography
of
the
underworld
in
which
osiris
is
king
is
worked
out
in
great
detail
when
the
sun
sets
in
the
west
ra
in
his
boat
enters
the
underworld
and
passes
through
it
during
the
twelve
hours
of
the
night
bringing
light
and
happiness
to
those
who
are
in
the
underworld
in
the
effort
to
secure
the
tomb
against
plundering
the
royal
graves
had
been
cut
in
the
solid
rock
long
and
complicated
passages
with
false
leads
and
deceptive
turns
and
the
burial
chamber
in
an
unexpected
place
the
long
walls
of
these
rooms
presented
a
great
surface
suitable
to
decoration
and
they
were
utilized
to
depict
scenes
from
the
underworld
and
the
passage
of
ra
through
it
so
that
the
tombs
became
in
fact
representations
of
the
land
of
the
dead
and
were
so
considered
these
royal
tombs
were
at
a
distance
from
the
cultivated
land
hidden
in
valleys
in
the
desert
their
funerary
temples
were
built
on
the
edge
of
the
desert
beside
the
temples
of
the
gods
of
the
place
such
fantastical
reconstructions
of
the
other
world
however
never
found
general
favor
and
are
confined
to
a
few
royal
tombs
the
priests
and
other
prominent
people
have
rolls
of
papyrus
buried
with
them
bearing
copies
of
books
of
the
dead
these
books
of
the
dead
are
made
up
of
a
series
of
chapters
each
complete
in
itself
and
each
dealing
with
some
phase
of
the
future
life
there
is
no
set
order
of
chapters
there
is
no
fixed
number
of
chapters
each
scribe
seems
to
have
selected
the
chapters
which
he
considered
useful
the
general
title
is
chapters
of
the
going
forth
by
day
the
general
character
may
be
given
by
a
paragraph
attached
to
one
of
the
chapters
in
the
book
of
ani
the
scribe
edited
by
budge
if
this
book
be
known
on
earth
and
written
on
the
coffin
it
is
my
mouth
he
shall
come
forth
by
day
in
any
form
he
desires
and
he
shall
go
into
his
place
without
being
prevented
there
shall
be
given
to
him
bread
and
beer
and
meat
upon
the
altar
of
osiris
he
shall
enter
in
in
peace
to
the
field
of
earu
according
to
this
decree
of
the
one
who
is
in
the
city
of
dedu
there
shall
be
given
to
him
wheat
and
barley
there
he
shall
flourish
as
he
did
upon
earth
he
shall
do
his
desires
like
these
nine
gods
who
are
in
the
underworld
as
found
true
millions
of
times
he
is
the
osiris
the
scribe
ani
there
are
chapters
to
overcome
all
the
evil
which
a
soul
may
encounter
there
are
words
to
greet
all
the
gods
whom
the
soul
desires
to
visit
the
scribe
ani
had
an
exceptional
position
on
earth
he
desires
to
do
his
desire
in
the
other
world
and
in
the
names
of
osiris
he
recites
the
magic
words
that
bring
him
the
power
he
is
ani
but
he
calls
himself
osiris
just
as
the
priestly
doctor
mixes
his
dose
of
medicine
and
calls
it
the
eye
of
horus
tested
and
found
true
in
addition
to
magical
texts
there
are
also
magical
or
symbolic
objects
placed
in
the
graves
amulets
of
various
kinds
which
were
to
be
used
in
the
other
world
some
of
these
were
simply
the
amulets
used
in
daily
life
to
guard
against
sickness
bite
of
snake
and
other
earthly
evils
which
were
also
incident
to
the
life
after
death
other
amulets
like
the
were
to
meet
special
conditions
of
the
other
world
these
or
answerers
were
little
images
of
workmen
bearing
agricultural
implements
whose
duty
it
was
to
take
the
place
of
the
dead
in
the
fields
of
earu
when
osiris
as
king
called
him
to
do
his
share
of
the
field
work
even
the
king
appears
liable
to
this
service
and
for
him
thousands
of
these
figures
were
made
sometimes
labeled
each
with
the
day
of
the
year
in
a
few
cases
there
was
even
a
charm
written
on
the
figure
to
prevent
it
hearing
the
command
of
any
one
but
its
master
alongside
these
manifold
manifestations
of
the
belief
in
magic
other
furniture
implements
weapons
and
utensils
are
still
placed
in
the
grave
the
offering
places
are
still
maintained
all
burials
are
now
extended
on
the
back
and
wrapped
in
bandages
yet
the
common
graves
lack
the
receptacles
for
the
viscera
lack
magical
texts
lack
ushabtiu
and
in
a
word
lack
all
those
things
which
are
typical
of
the
graves
of
the
period
the
conception
of
the
future
life
among
the
common
people
is
apparently
not
essentially
different
from
that
of
the
old
empire
but
the
books
of
the
dead
and
the
offering
formulas
show
that
the
priests
and
high
officials
at
death
were
called
osiris
by
the
end
of
the
late
period
the
osiris
cult
of
the
dead
had
come
to
be
universal
no
doubt
political
events
had
much
to
do
with
this
the
absorption
of
the
powers
of
the
king
by
the
priesthood
of
the
national
god
the
crushing
of
the
nobility
by
a
succession
of
foreign
invaders
and
the
general
uncertainty
of
life
had
disturbed
the
old
fixed
relations
the
hope
of
every
egyptian
turned
to
a
glorified
future
life
as
osiris
the
tendency
to
use
magical
texts
and
symbolic
objects
reached
its
height
about
a
revival
of
national
life
brought
about
by
the
establishment
of
the
egyptian
kings
of
sais
as
kings
of
egypt
led
to
a
renaissance
of
egyptian
art
the
old
monuments
were
copied
and
imitated
the
old
funerary
texts
and
offering
formulas
were
sought
out
in
the
older
graves
even
the
pyramid
texts
reappear
after
one
thousand
years
of
practical
oblivion
the
value
of
master
words
was
so
firmly
fixed
in
the
egyptian
mind
that
misunderstood
texts
of
all
sorts
were
copied
out
and
placed
in
the
graves
to
secure
to
the
dead
some
vague
benefit
in
the
other
world
the
process
of
mummification
was
at
its
height
the
bodies
were
no
longer
preserved
the
process
was
merely
the
creation
of
a
simulacrum
of
the
dead
osiris
all
the
perishable
parts
of
the
body
were
removed
or
destroyed
by
chemicals
only
the
skin
bones
hair
and
teeth
remained
to
be
padded
with
mud
and
resin
wrapped
in
cloths
covered
with
a
painted
and
gilded
to
represent
the
glorified
osiris
mummy
viii
the
period
in
the
period
we
see
the
final
stage
of
the
osiris
cult
every
dead
man
is
laid
in
his
grave
without
furniture
prepared
as
a
simulacrum
of
osiris
the
wealthiest
people
have
gilded
and
painted
mummy
cases
with
amulets
and
funerary
papyrus
the
poorer
are
merely
bundles
of
wrappings
every
dead
man
is
osiris
and
no
doubt
carried
with
him
words
learned
on
earth
to
gain
his
way
to
a
place
in
the
kingdom
of
osiris
the
offering
places
above
the
grave
are
still
made
and
offerings
are
still
brought
to
gain
some
idea
of
the
way
in
which
these
two
conceptions
of
the
living
dead
were
worked
out
in
actual
life
one
has
only
to
turn
to
the
funerary
customs
of
the
modern
egyptians
in
the
case
of
both
christians
and
moslems
the
grave
rites
are
similar
but
with
those
of
the
moslems
i
am
more
familiar
the
grave
consists
still
of
the
two
parts
the
burying
place
and
the
offering
place
the
swathed
body
is
laid
on
the
right
side
with
the
right
hand
under
the
cheek
and
the
face
towards
mecca
at
the
burial
the
confession
of
the
faith
is
recited
over
and
over
lest
the
dead
forget
it
korans
are
sometimes
placed
in
the
graves
and
i
have
even
seen
a
confession
of
the
faith
written
on
paper
and
placed
on
a
twig
before
the
face
of
the
dead
at
the
appointed
seasons
especially
at
the
great
feast
of
sacrifice
offerings
are
brought
to
the
grave
the
family
party
passes
through
the
cemetery
the
women
bearing
baskets
of
bread
and
bottles
of
water
the
men
turning
the
head
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
and
reciting
the
in
propitiation
of
the
spirits
the
party
enters
the
offering
inclosure
of
the
grave
of
their
relative
the
wives
greet
the
dead
peace
unto
thee
oh
my
husband
oh
my
father
we
have
wept
until
we
have
watered
the
earth
with
our
tears
on
thy
account
the
offerings
are
laid
before
the
tomb
a
scribe
is
called
and
recites
or
reads
some
chapter
of
the
koran
over
and
over
one
hundred
one
hundred
and
fifty
five
hundred
one
thousand
times
and
concludes
i
have
read
this
for
thee
oh
such
and
such
a
one
or
i
have
transferred
the
merit
of
this
to
thee
when
you
question
these
people
as
to
the
particulars
of
their
belief
you
find
their
ideas
vague
and
indefinite
among
the
men
a
dispute
quickly
starts
the
people
who
have
been
found
good
by
the
examining
angels
on
the
night
of
the
burial
are
there
but
the
bad
are
somewhere
else
no
says
another
they
are
all
in
their
graves
but
the
bad
suffer
torment
still
another
maintains
that
the
good
have
already
passed
to
the
lowest
heaven
these
are
all
mere
remnants
of
theological
discussions
caught
from
the
sheikhs
the
women
stolidly
maintain
that
the
dead
are
in
their
tombs
and
the
offerings
must
be
brought
when
you
inquire
which
are
the
good
and
which
are
the
bad
there
is
again
a
great
divergence
of
opinion
but
it
is
clear
that
every
man
believes
in
his
heart
that
a
knowledge
of
the
prayers
and
forms
of
the
moslem
religion
is
absolutely
essential
and
entirely
sufficient
to
gain
a
desirable
future
life
the
great
master
word
is
the
confession
of
faith
there
is
no
god
but
allah
and
mohammed
is
his
prophet
so
it
must
have
been
in
the
last
stage
of
the
osiris
cult
immortality
a
glorified
future
existence
as
an
osiris
in
the
kingdom
of
osiris
with
all
the
pleasures
and
comforts
of
life
was
secured
to
him
who
was
buried
with
the
proper
rites
and
knew
the
magic
words
and
yet
the
old
feeling
was
never
lost
that
the
dead
was
somehow
in
the
grave
and
might
suffer
hunger
and
thirst
when
christianity
came
into
egypt
all
the
gaudy
apparatus
of
the
osiris
religion
was
swept
out
of
existence
the
body
was
to
rise
again
and
might
not
be
mutilated
mummification
which
destroyed
the
body
in
order
to
preserve
a
conventional
simulacrum
ceased
abruptly
grave
furniture
was
of
course
unthinkable
but
the
use
of
charms
did
not
cease
crosses
were
embroidered
in
the
gravecloths
or
small
crosses
of
metal
or
wood
placed
on
the
breast
or
arm
the
gravestone
bore
a
simple
prayer
to
the
holy
spirit
for
the
peaceful
rest
of
the
soul
but
the
offering
place
was
still
maintained
prayers
were
recited
on
the
feast
days
lamps
were
allowed
to
remain
at
the
grave
food
was
brought
but
given
to
the
poor
in
all
periods
there
are
thousands
of
graves
of
poor
people
without
a
single
thing
to
secure
their
future
life
people
who
were
probably
content
simply
to
lay
down
the
burdens
of
life
in
the
christian
period
these
thousands
of
unnamed
dead
all
have
one
mark
they
are
laid
with
their
feet
to
the
east
each
one
was
a
christian
and
secure
in
his
future
life
according
to
his
faith
and
his
life
on
earth
ix
summary
to
sum
up
the
essential
idea
of
the
egyptian
conception
of
immortality
was
that
the
ghost
or
spirit
of
the
man
preserved
the
personality
and
the
form
of
the
man
in
the
existence
after
death
that
this
spirit
had
the
same
desires
the
same
pleasures
the
same
necessities
and
the
same
fears
as
on
earth
life
after
death
was
a
duplicate
of
life
on
earth
on
earth
life
depended
on
work
on
getting
food
from
the
fields
and
the
herds
on
forming
stone
and
metal
hide
and
vegetable
fibre
into
useful
objects
in
other
words
life
depended
on
human
power
over
the
natural
materials
of
the
earth
at
the
same
time
there
were
many
things
which
could
not
be
controlled
by
power
over
the
earth
and
its
elements
the
sting
of
the
scorpion
the
bite
of
the
adder
the
rise
of
the
nile
sickness
the
sudden
onslaught
of
the
enemy
the
straying
of
cattle
the
disfavor
of
the
god
for
these
evils
man
only
hope
was
magic
the
set
words
spoken
in
the
proper
manner
which
have
power
over
all
unseen
influence
so
in
the
case
of
life
after
death
all
which
human
strength
can
provide
of
stores
of
grain
and
drink
and
garments
must
be
secured
for
his
use
but
he
must
also
be
provided
with
the
magic
words
to
meet
the
chance
evils
of
the
future
life
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
unknown
future
presented
to
the
imagination
many
evils
unknown
on
earth
the
spirit
might
forget
its
name
it
might
lose
its
heart
it
might
be
bound
fast
by
evil
powers
in
the
grave
and
unable
to
come
forth
by
day
the
mummy
might
decay
the
spirit
might
forget
its
form
so
as
time
went
on
the
use
of
magic
words
became
of
greater
and
greater
importance
until
to
modern
eyes
it
seemed
to
overshadow
all
else
in
the
egyptian
conception
of
life
after
death
as
a
part
of
the
magical
provisions
of
the
dead
the
osiris
myth
probably
built
up
in
explanation
of
old
rites
was
drawn
into
the
belief
in
a
future
life
and
apparently
at
the
beginning
for
the
benefit
of
the
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
claimed
a
certain
divinity
on
earth
the
osiris
god
of
the
living
had
died
and
had
been
brought
to
life
as
god
of
the
dead
so
also
the
the
horus
the
son
of
ra
must
die
but
he
also
would
live
again
in
the
other
world
and
share
the
throne
of
osiris
more
than
this
even
he
became
osiris
he
was
admitted
to
the
life
of
the
gods
of
course
the
ideas
of
the
existence
of
the
gods
were
never
clear
and
consistent
they
lived
in
secret
places
their
whole
life
was
mysterious
as
well
as
powerful
these
are
the
field
of
knowledge
which
the
egyptian
mind
could
not
oversee
with
any
satisfaction
to
itself
the
most
it
could
do
was
to
formulate
the
magic
words
invoking
the
names
of
the
gods
and
conjuring
them
by
the
events
in
the
osiris
myth
to
accept
this
king
as
osiris
the
exceptional
man
the
must
have
an
exceptional
future
life
but
to
obtain
it
he
must
have
the
knowledge
of
the
names
and
words
necessary
to
force
the
powers
of
the
other
world
thus
the
idea
of
an
exceptional
future
life
a
heaven
was
brought
into
the
egyptian
conception
of
life
after
death
admission
to
it
depended
on
the
exceptional
position
on
earth
of
those
admitted
as
even
this
exceptional
position
was
only
of
avail
when
combined
with
the
knowledge
of
certain
formulas
it
is
not
difficult
to
see
how
the
knowledge
of
these
formulas
might
be
considered
sufficient
to
obtain
the
better
future
life
even
for
others
than
the
king
when
in
the
depression
that
followed
the
extravagance
of
the
pyramid
age
the
central
monarchy
lost
its
power
egypt
broke
up
into
a
series
of
tribal
baronies
nomes
in
each
was
a
ruler
almost
independent
of
the
king
a
man
who
might
presume
with
the
proper
knowledge
to
claim
a
glorified
future
life
similar
to
that
of
the
king
and
indeed
we
find
from
the
burial
inscriptions
of
the
middle
empire
that
such
was
the
result
feudalism
extended
the
possibilities
of
heaven
to
the
great
nobles
in
the
new
empire
the
royal
power
was
gradually
absorbed
by
the
priestly
organization
of
the
national
religion
the
religion
of
and
the
principle
comes
into
practice
that
any
priest
having
the
necessary
knowledge
could
obtain
for
himself
an
exceptional
place
in
the
future
life
the
osirian
burial
customs
spread
even
among
the
people
the
swathed
body
extended
on
the
back
becomes
universal
even
though
true
mummification
was
still
only
for
the
rich
in
the
ptolemaic
period
the
preparation
of
all
the
apparatus
of
the
osiris
burial
was
divided
up
into
trades
factories
one
may
say
turned
out
mummy
cases
of
various
kinds
with
a
scale
of
prices
to
fit
every
purse
other
factories
turned
out
amulets
and
charms
magical
texts
the
preparation
of
the
body
the
construction
of
the
grave
all
things
were
done
by
regular
crafts
the
cheapening
of
the
apparatus
is
most
striking
at
the
same
time
all
but
the
poorest
burials
bear
direct
evidence
of
their
character
as
osiris
burials
on
the
side
of
the
moral
requirement
we
must
not
look
too
closely
there
were
powerful
words
which
could
compel
even
the
great
judges
of
the
dead
to
return
a
favorable
verdict
there
were
magic
hearts
of
stone
which
might
be
worn
in
place
of
the
heart
and
laid
in
the
scales
by
anubis
weigh
heavier
than
the
truth
one
might
by
words
compel
anubis
to
accept
this
stone
heart
instead
of
the
real
heart
in
general
one
may
say
that
the
hope
of
immortality
had
little
influence
on
the
moral
life
of
the
ordinary
egyptian
the
moral
code
was
simple
and
sound
and
not
greatly
different
from
other
primitive
codes
forbidding
all
those
things
which
the
body
of
men
regard
as
unpleasant
in
others
commanding
the
plain
virtues
which
were
found
pleasant
in
others
here
again
i
think
we
may
well
look
to
modern
egypt
for
a
picture
of
ancient
egypt
we
must
not
exaggerate
the
influence
of
the
belief
in
immortality
on
general
morality
we
must
not
think
too
well
of
the
life
of
the
people
nor
on
the
other
hand
too
evil
they
had
their
sins
and
their
virtues
the
common
herd
was
driven
by
necessity
and
lived
as
it
could
they
clung
to
the
belief
in
a
life
in
the
grave
the
greater
people
had
leisure
to
learn
and
to
provide
the
magic
necessary
to
secure
a
comfortable
future
life
they
loved
life
and
hated
death
thus
it
was
when
the
priests
of
the
religion
made
their
bid
to
the
classical
world
they
offered
immortality
by
initiation
learn
the
proper
rites
learn
the
master
words
and
secure
eternal
life
among
the
great
gods
it
was
a
religion
for
the
exceptional
man
down
to
the
last
it
required
training
and
knowledge
even
in
its
most
popular
form
in
the
ptolemaic
period
a
specially
instructed
class
was
required
who
sold
for
money
the
benefits
of
their
knowledge
and
men
took
rank
in
their
security
of
future
life
according
to
their
means
not
until
christianity
came
offering
eternal
life
free
and
without
price
did
the
common
people
find
at
last
a
road
open
to
equal
immortality
with
the
great
men
of
the
earth
