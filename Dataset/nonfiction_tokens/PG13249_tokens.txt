report

committee
of

in
on
a
bill
proposed
to
protect

the
passenger
pigeon
needs
no

wonderfully
prolific
having
the
vast
forests
of

as
its
breeding

traveling
hundreds

it
is
here

elsewhere
and
no
ordinary
destruction
can
lessen
them

from
the
myriads
that
are
yearly
produced
the
snipe
needs
no
protection
the
snipe
too
like
the

will
take
care

itself

its

numbers
can

this
volume
is
dedicated
by
a
sincere
admirer
drink
to
him
he
is
not
here
yet
i
would
guard
his
glory
a
knight
without
reproach
or
fear
should
live
in
song
and
foreword
the
preservation
of
animal
and
plant
life
and
of
the
general
beauty
of
nature
is
one
of
the
foremost
duties
of
the
men
and
women
of
it
is
an
imperative
duty
because
it
must
be
performed
at
once
for
otherwise
it
will
be
too
late
every
possible
means
of
preservation
sentimental
educational
and
legislative
must
be
employed
the
present
warning
issues
with
no
uncertain
sound
because
this
great
battle
for
preservation
and
conservation
can
not
be
won
by
gentle
tones
nor
by
appeals
to
the
aesthetic
instincts
of
those
who
have
no
sense
of
beauty
or
enjoyment
of
nature
it
is
necessary
to
sound
a
loud
alarm
to
present
the
facts
in
very
strong
language
backed
up
by
irrefutable
statistics
and
by
photographs
which
tell
no
lies
to
establish
the
law
and
enforce
it
if
needs
be
with
a
bludgeon
this
book
is
such
an
alarm
call
its
forceful
pages
remind
me
of
the
sounding
of
the
great
bells
in
the
of
the
cities
of
the
middle
ages
which
called
the
citizens
to
arms
to
protect
their
homes
their
liberties
and
their
happiness
it
is
undeniable
that
the
welfare
and
happiness
of
our
own
and
of
all
future
generations
of
americans
are
at
stake
in
this
battle
for
the
preservation
of
nature
against
the
selfishness
the
ignorance
or
the
cruelty
of
her
destroyers
we
no
longer
destroy
great
works
of
art
they
are
treasured
and
regarded
as
of
priceless
value
but
we
have
yet
to
attain
the
state
of
civilization
where
the
destruction
of
a
glorious
work
of
nature
whether
it
be
a
cliff
a
forest
or
a
species
of
mammal
or
bird
is
regarded
with
equal
abhorrence
the
whole
earth
is
a
poorer
place
to
live
in
when
a
colony
of
exquisite
egrets
or
birds
of
paradise
is
destroyed
in
order
that
the
plumes
may
decorate
the
hat
of
some
lady
of
fashion
and
ultimately
find
their
way
into
the
rubbish
heap
the
people
of
all
the
new
england
states
are
poorer
when
the
ignorant
whites
foreigners
or
negroes
of
our
southern
states
destroy
the
robins
and
other
song
birds
of
the
north
for
a
mess
of
pottage
travels
through
europe
as
well
as
over
a
large
part
of
the
north
american
continent
have
convinced
me
that
nowhere
is
nature
being
destroyed
so
rapidly
as
in
the
united
states
except
within
our
conservation
areas
an
earthly
paradise
is
being
turned
into
an
earthly
hades
and
it
is
not
savages
nor
primitive
men
who
are
doing
this
but
men
and
women
who
boast
of
their
civilization
air
and
water
are
polluted
rivers
and
streams
serve
as
sewers
and
dumping
grounds
forests
are
swept
away
and
fishes
are
driven
from
the
streams
many
birds
are
becoming
extinct
and
certain
mammals
are
on
the
verge
of
extermination
vulgar
advertisements
hide
the
landscape
and
in
all
that
disfigures
the
wonderful
heritage
of
the
beauty
of
nature
we
americans
are
in
the
lead
fortunately
the
tide
of
destruction
is
ebbing
and
the
tide
of
conservation
is
coming
in
americans
are
practical
like
all
other
northern
peoples
they
love
money
and
will
sacrifice
much
for
it
but
they
are
also
full
of
idealism
as
well
as
of
moral
and
spiritual
energy
the
influence
of
the
splendid
body
of
americans
and
canadians
who
have
turned
their
best
forces
of
mind
and
language
into
literature
and
into
political
power
for
the
conservation
movement
is
becoming
stronger
every
day
yet
we
are
far
from
the
point
where
the
momentum
of
conservation
is
strong
enough
to
arrest
and
roll
back
the
tide
of
destruction
and
this
is
especially
true
with
regard
to
our
fast
vanishing
animal
life
the
facts
and
figures
set
forth
in
this
volume
will
astonish
all
those
lovers
of
nature
and
friends
of
the
animal
world
who
are
living
in
a
false
or
imaginary
sense
of
security
the
logic
of
these
facts
is
inexorable
as
regards
our
birds
and
mammals
the
failures
of
supposed
protection
in
america
under
a
system
of
free
shooting
are
so
glaring
that
we
are
confident
this
exposure
will
lead
to
sweeping
reforms
the
author
of
this
work
is
no
amateur
in
the
field
of
protection
his
ideas
concerning
methods
of
reform
are
drawn
from
long
and
successful
experience
the
states
which
are
still
behind
in
this
movement
may
well
give
serious
heed
to
his
summons
and
pass
the
new
laws
that
are
so
urgently
demanded
to
save
the
vanishing
remnant
the
new
york
zoological
society
which
is
cooperating
with
many
other
organizations
in
this
great
movement
sends
forth
this
work
in
the
belief
that
there
is
no
one
who
is
more
ardently
devoted
to
the
great
cause
or
rendering
more
effective
service
in
it
than
william
hornaday
we
believe
that
this
is
a
great
book
destined
to
exert
a
influence
to
be
translated
into
other
languages
and
to
arouse
the
defenders
and
lovers
of
our
vanishing
animal
life
before
it
is
too
late
henry
fairfield
osborn
december
of
the
new
york
zoological
preface
the
writing
of
this
book
has
taught
me
many
things
beyond
question
we
are
exterminating
our
finest
species
of
mammals
birds
and
fishes
to
law
i
am
appalled
by
the
mass
of
evidence
proving
that
throughout
the
entire
united
states
and
canada
in
every
state
and
province
the
existing
legal
system
for
the
preservation
of
wild
life
is
fatally
defective
there
is
not
a
single
state
in
our
country
from
which
the
killable
game
is
not
being
rapidly
and
persistently
shot
to
death
legally
or
illegally
very
much
more
rapidly
than
it
is
breeding
with
extermination
for
the
most
of
it
close
in
sight
this
statement
is
not
open
to
argument
for
millions
of
men
know
that
it
is
literally
true
we
are
living
in
a
fool
paradise
the
rage
for
slaughter
is
far
more
prevalent
throughout
the
world
than
it
was
in
when
the
buffalo
butchers
paved
the
prairies
of
texas
and
colorado
with
festering
carcasses
from
one
end
of
our
continent
to
the
other
there
is
a
restless
resistless
desire
to
kill
i
have
been
shocked
by
the
accumulation
of
evidence
showing
that
all
over
our
country
and
canada
fully
of
our
protective
laws
have
practically
been
dictated
by
the
killers
of
the
game
and
that
in
all
save
a
very
few
instances
the
hunters
have
been
exceedingly
careful
to
provide
open
seasons
for
slaughter
as
long
as
any
game
remains
to
kill
yet
the
game
of
north
america
does
not
belong
wholly
and
exclusively
to
the
men
who
kill
the
other
per
cent
of
the
people
have
vested
rights
in
it
far
exceeding
those
of
the
three
per
cent
posterity
has
claims
upon
it
that
no
honest
man
can
i
am
now
going
to
ask
both
the
true
sportsman
and
the
people
who
do
not
kill
wild
things
to
awake
and
do
their
plain
duty
in
protecting
and
preserving
the
game
and
other
wild
life
which
belongs
partly
to
us
but
chiefly
to
those
who
come
after
us
can
they
be
aroused
before
it
is
too
late
the
time
to
discuss
tiresome
academic
theories
regarding
bag
limits
and
different
open
seasons
as
being
sufficient
to
preserve
the
game
has
gone
by
we
have
reached
the
point
where
the
alternatives
are
closed
seasons
or
a
gameless
continent
and
we
must
choose
one
or
the
other
speedily
a
continent
without
wild
life
is
like
a
forest
with
no
leaves
on
the
trees
the
great
increase
in
the
slaughter
of
song
birds
for
food
by
the
negroes
and
poor
whites
of
the
south
has
become
an
unbearable
scourge
to
our
migratory
birds
the
very
birds
on
which
farmers
north
and
south
depend
for
protection
from
the
insect
hordes
the
very
birds
that
are
most
near
and
dear
to
the
people
of
the
north
slaughter
is
growing
and
with
the
decrease
of
the
game
birds
it
is
a
matter
that
requires
instant
attention
and
stern
repression
at
the
present
moment
it
seems
that
the
only
remedy
lies
in
federal
protection
for
all
migratory
birds
because
so
many
states
will
not
do
their
duty
we
are
weary
of
witnessing
the
greed
selfishness
and
cruelty
of
civilized
man
toward
the
wild
creatures
of
the
earth
we
are
sick
of
tales
of
slaughter
and
pictures
of
carnage
it
is
time
for
a
sweeping
reformation
and
that
is
precisely
what
we
now
demand
i
have
been
a
sportsman
myself
but
times
have
changed
and
we
must
change
also
when
game
was
plentiful
i
believed
that
it
was
right
for
men
and
boys
to
kill
a
limited
amount
of
it
for
sport
and
for
the
table
but
the
old
basis
has
been
swept
away
by
an
army
of
destruction
that
now
is
almost
beyond
all
control
we
must
awake
and
arouse
to
the
new
situation
face
it
like
men
and
adjust
our
minds
to
the
new
conditions
the
three
million
gunners
of
must
no
longer
expect
or
demand
the
same
generous
hunting
privileges
that
were
right
for
hunters
fifty
years
ago
when
game
was
fifty
times
as
plentiful
as
it
is
now
and
there
was
only
one
killer
for
every
fifty
now
in
the
field
the
fatalistic
idea
that
laws
can
save
the
game
is
curse
of
all
our
game
birds
mammals
and
fishes
it
is
a
fraud
a
delusion
and
a
snare
that
miserable
fetish
has
been
worshipped
much
too
long
our
game
is
being
exterminated
everywhere
by
blind
insistence
upon
open
seasons
and
solemn
reliance
upon
legal
if
a
majority
of
the
people
of
america
feel
that
so
long
as
there
is
any
game
alive
there
must
be
an
annual
two
months
or
four
months
open
season
for
its
slaughter
then
assuredly
we
soon
will
have
a
gameless
continent
the
only
thing
that
will
save
the
game
is
by
stopping
the
killing
of
it
in
establishing
and
promulgating
this
principle
the
cause
of
protection
greatly
needs
three
things
money
labor
and
publicity
with
the
first
we
can
secure
the
second
and
third
but
can
we
get
it
and
it
in
time
to
save
this
volume
is
in
every
sense
a
contribution
to
a
cause
and
as
such
it
ever
will
remain
i
wish
the
public
to
receive
it
on
that
basis
so
much
important
material
has
drifted
straight
to
it
from
other
hands
that
this
unexpected
aid
seems
to
the
author
like
a
good
omen
the
manuscript
has
received
the
benefit
of
a
close
and
critical
reading
and
correcting
by
my
comrade
on
the
and
esteemed
friend
madison
grant
through
which
the
text
was
greatly
improved
but
for
the
splendid
encouragement
and
assistance
that
i
have
received
from
him
and
from
professor
henry
fairneld
osborn
the
work
involved
would
have
borne
down
rather
heavily
the

by

flourished
but
ahab
came
alas
for

in
order
that
the
american
people
may
correctly
understand
and
judge
the
question
of
the
extinction
or
preservation
of
our
wild
life
it
is
necessary
to
recall
the
near
past
it
is
not
necessary
however
to
go
far
into
the
details
of
history
for
a
few
quick
glances
at
a
few
high
points
will
be
quite
sufficient
for
the
purpose
in
view
any
man
who
reads
the
books
which
best
tell
the
story
of
the
development
of
the
american
colonies
of
into
the
american
nation
of
and
takes
due
note
of
the
features
of
the
tale
will
say
without
hesitation
that
when
the
american
people
received
this
land
from
the
bountiful
hand
of
nature
it
was
endowed
with
a
magnificent
and
supply
of
valuable
wild
creatures
the
pioneers
and
the
early
settlers
were
too
busy
even
to
take
due
note
of
that
fact
or
to
comment
upon
it
save
in
very
fragmentary
ways
nevertheless
the
abundance
of
early
american
days
survived
down
to
so
late
a
period
that
it
touched
the
lives
of
millions
of
people
now
living
any
man
years
of
age
who
when
a
boy
had
a
taste
for
hunting
for
at
that
time
there
were
no
sportsmen
in
america
will
remember
the
flocks
and
herds
of
wild
creatures
that
he
saw
and
which
made
upon
his
mind
many
indelible
impressions
abundance
is
the
word
with
which
to
describe
the
original
animal
life
that
stocked
our
country
and
all
north
america
only
a
short
ago
throughout
every
state
on
every
in
all
the
millions
of
fresh
water
lakes
ponds
and
rivers
on
every
mountain
range
in
every
forest
even
on
every
the
wild
flocks
and
herds
held
sway
it
was
impossible
to
go
beyond
the
settled
haunts
of
civilized
man
and
escape
them
it
was
a
full
century
after
the
complete
settlement
of
new
england
and
the
virginia
colonies
that
the
wonderful
fauna
of
the
great
plains
and
rocky
mountains
was
really
discovered
but
the
bison
millions
the
antelope
millions
the
mule
deer
the
mountain
sheep
and
mountain
goat
were
there
all
the
time
in
the
early
days
the
millions
of
pinnated
grouse
and
quail
of
the
central
states
attracted
no
serious
attention
from
the
american
but
they
lived
and
flourished
just
the
same
far
down
in
the
seventies
when
the
greedy
market
gunners
systematically
slaughtered
them
and
barreled
them
up
for
the
market
while
the
foolish
farmers
calmly
permitted
them
to
do
it
we
obtain
the
best
of
our
history
of
the
former
abundance
of
north
american
wild
life
first
from
the
pages
of
audubon
and
wilson
next
from
the
records
left
by
such
pioneers
as
lewis
and
clark
and
last
from
the
testimony
of
living
men
to
all
this
we
can
many
of
us
add
observations
of
our
own
to
me
the
most
striking
fact
that
stands
forth
in
the
story
of
american
wild
life
one
hundred
years
ago
is
the
wide
extent
and
thoroughness
of
its
distribution
wide
as
our
country
is
and
marvelous
as
it
is
in
the
diversity
of
its
climates
its
soils
its
topography
its
flora
its
riches
and
its
poverty
nature
gave
to
each
square
mile
and
to
each
acre
a
generous
quota
of
wild
creatures
according
to
its
ability
to
maintain
living
things
no
pioneer
ever
pushed
so
far
or
into
regions
so
difficult
or
so
remote
that
he
did
not
find
awaiting
him
a
host
of
birds
and
beasts
sometimes
the
pioneer
was
not
a
good
hunter
usually
he
was
a
stupid
fisherman
but
the
game
was
there
nevertheless
the
time
was
when
every
farm
had
its
quota
the
part
that
the
wild
life
of
america
played
in
the
settlement
and
development
of
this
continent
was
so
in
extent
and
so
enormous
in
potential
value
that
it
fairly
staggers
the
imagination
from
the
landing
of
the
pilgrims
down
to
the
present
hour
the
wild
game
has
been
the
mainstay
and
the
resource
against
starvation
of
the
pathfinder
the
settler
the
prospector
and
at
times
even
the
in
view
of
what
the
bison
millions
did
for
the
dakotas
montana
wyoming
kansas
and
texas
it
is
only
right
and
square
that
those
states
should
now
do
something
for
the
perpetual
preservation
of
the
bison
species
and
all
other
big
game
that
needs
help
for
years
and
years
the
antelope
millions
of
the
montana
and
wyoming
fed
the
scout
and
freighter
cowboy
and
surveyor
ranchman
but
thus
far
i
have
yet
to
hear
of
one
western
state
that
has
ever
spent
one
penny
directly
for
the
preservation
of
the
antelope
and
we
are
in
a
fight
in
congress
and
in
montana
with
the
association
which
maintains
in
washington
a
keen
lobbyist
to
keep
aloft
the
tariff
on
wool
and
prevent
congress
from
taking
square
miles
of
grass
lands
on
snow
creek
montana
for
a
national
antelope
preserve
all
that
the
want
is
the
entire
earth
all
to
themselves
mcclure
the
secretary
of
the
association
says
the
proper
place
in
which
to
preserve
the
big
game
of
the
west
is
in
city
parks
where
it
can
be
protected
to
the
colonist
of
the
east
and
pioneer
of
the
west
the
deer
was
an
ever
present
help
in
time
of
trouble
without
this
omnipresent
animal
and
the
supply
of
good
meat
that
each
white
flag
represented
the
commissariat
difficulties
of
the
settlers
who
won
the
country
as
far
westward
as
indiana
would
have
been
many
times
greater
than
they
were

progress
was

independence
and
yet
how
many
men
are
there
out
of
our
ninety
millions
of
americans
and
who
remember
with
any
feeling
of
gratitude
the
part
played
in
american
history
by
the
deer
very
few
how
many
americans
are
there
in
our
land
who
now
preserve
that
deer
for
sentimental
reasons
and
because
his
forbears
were
as
a
matter
of
fact
are
there
any
on
every
eastern
pioneer
monument
the
deer
should
figure
and
on
those
of
the
great
west
the
bison
and
the
antelope
should
be
cast
in
enduring
bronze
we
forget
the
game
birds
of
america
played
a
different
part
from
that
of
the
deer
antelope
and
bison
in
the
early
days
shotguns
were
few
and
shot
was
scarce
and
dear
the
wild
turkey
and
goose
were
the
smallest
birds
on
which
a
rifleman
could
afford
to
expend
a
bullet
and
a
whole
charge
of
powder
it
was
for
this
reason
that
the
deer
bear
bison
and
elk
disappeared
from
the
eastern
united
states
while
the
game
birds
yet
remained
abundant
with
the
disappearance
of
the
big
game
came
the
fat
steer
hog
and
hominy
the
fruit
orchard
and
poultry
galore
the
game
birds
of
america
as
a
class
and
a
mass
have
not
been
swept
away
to
ward
off
starvation
or
to
rescue
the
perishing
even
back
in
the
sixties
and
seventies
very
very
few
men
of
the
north
thought
of
killing
prairie
chickens
ducks
and
quail
snipe
and
woodcock
in
order
to
keep
the
hunger
wolf
from
the
door
the
process
was
too
slow
and
uncertain
and
besides
the
man
rarely
had
the
gun
and
ammunition
instead
of
attempting
to
live
on
birds
he
hustled
for
the
staple
food
products
that
the
soil
of
his
own
farm
could
produce
first
last
and
nearly
all
the
time
the
game
birds
of
the
united
states
as
a
whole
have
been
sacrificed
on
the
altar
of
rank
luxury
to
tempt
appetites
that
were
tired
of
fried
chicken
and
other
farm
delicacies
even
the
average
poor
man
hunts
birds
for
the
joy
of
the
outing
and
the
pampered
epicures
of
the
hotels
and
restaurants
buy
game
birds
and
eat
small
portions
of
them
solely
to
tempt
jaded
appetites
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
class
legislation
it
is
that
which
permits
a
few
sordid
to
slaughter
the
birds
of
the
whole
people
in
order
to
sell
them
to
a
few
epicures
the
game
of
a
state
belongs
to
the
whole
people
of
the
state
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
so
decided
geer
connecticut
if
it
is
abundant
it
is
a
valuable
asset
the
great
value
of
the
game
birds
of
america
lies
not
in
their
meat
pounds
as
they
lie
upon
the
table
but
in
the
temptation
they
annually
put
before
millions
of
farmers
and
clerks
and
merchants
to
get
into
their
beloved
hunting
togs
stalk
out
into
the
lap
of
nature
and
say
begone
dull
care
and
the
man
who
has
had
a
fine
day
in
the
painted
woods
on
the
bright
waters
of
a
bay
or
in
the
golden
stubble
of
september
can
fill
his
day
and
his
soul
with
six
good
birds
just
as
well
as
with
sixty
the
idea
that
in
order
to
enjoy
a
fine
day
in
the
open
a
man
must
kill
a
load
of
birds
is
a
mistaken
idea
and
if
obstinately
adhered
to
it
becomes
vicious
the
outing
in
the
open
is
the
thing
not
the
feathers
nasty
viscera
and
death
in
the
one
quail
on
a
fence
is
worth
more
to
the
world
than
ten
in
a
bag
the
farmers
of
america
have
by
their
own
supineness
and
lack
of
foresight
permitted
the
slaughter
of
a
stock
of
game
birds
which
had
it
been
properly
and
wisely
conserved
would
have
furnished
a
good
annual
shoot
to
every
farming
man
and
boy
of
sporting
instincts
through
the
past
right
down
to
the
present
and
far
beyond
they
have
allowed
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
birds
to
be
coolly
snatched
away
from
them
by
the
greedy
there
is
one
state
in
america
and
so
far
as
i
know
in
which
there
is
at
this
moment
an
abundance
of
life
that
is
the
state
of
louisiana
the
reason
is
not
so
very
far
to
seek
for
the
birds
that
do
not
migrate
quail
wild
turkeys
and

the
cover
is

for
the
migratory

birds
of

louisiana
is
a
grand
central
depot
with
terminal
facilities
that
are
unsurpassed
her
reedy
shores
her
vast
marshes
her
long
coast
line
and
abundance
of
food
furnish
what
should
be
not
only
a
haven
but
a
heaven
for
ducks
and
geese
after
running
the
gauntlet
of
guns
all
the
way
from
manitoba
and
ontario
to
the
sunk
lands
of
arkansas
the
shores
of
the
gulf
must
seem
like
heaven
itself
the
great
forests
of
louisiana
shelter
deer
turkeys
and
animals
galore
and
rabbits
and
squirrels
abound
naturally
this
abundance
of
game
has
given
rise
to
an
extensive
industry
in
shooting
for
the
market
the
big
interests
outside
the
state
send
their
agents
into
the
best
game
districts
often
bringing
in
their
own
force
of
shooters
they
comb
out
the
game
in
enormous
quantities
without
leaving
to
the
people
of
louisiana
any
decent
and
fair
for
having
despoiled
them
of
their
game
and
shipped
a
vast
annual
product
outside
to
create
wealth
elsewhere
at
present
however
we
are
but
incidentally
interested
in
the
of
the
people
of
the
pelican
state
as
a
state
of
oldtime
abundance
in
killable
game
the
killing
records
that
were
kept
in
the
year
possess
for
us
very
great
interest
they
throw
a
startling
searchlight
on
the
subject
of
this
chapter
the
former
abundance
of
wild
life
from
the
records
that
with
great
pains
and
labor
were
gathered
by
the
state
game
commission
and
which
were
furnished
me
for
use
here
by
president
frank
miller
we
set
forth
this
remarkable
exhibit
of
abundance
in
game
official
record
of
game

in
louisiana
during
the
season

grand
total

and

of
the
thousands
of
slaughtered

it
would
seem
that
no
records
exist
it
is
to
be
understood
that
the
annual
slaughter
of
wild
life
in
louisiana
never
before
reached
such
a
pitch
as
now
without
drastic
measures
what
will
be
the
inevitable
result
does
any
man
suppose
that
even
the
wild
millions
of
louisiana
can
long
withstand
such
slaughter
as
that
shown
by
the
official
figures
given
above
it
is
wildly
impossible
but
the
darkest
hour
is
just
before
the
dawn
at
the
session
of
the
louisiana
legislature
that
was
held
in
the
spring
of
great
improvements
were
made
in
the
game
laws
of
that
state
the
most
important
feature
was
the
suppression
of
wholesale
market
hunting
by
persons
who
are
not
residents
of
the
state
a
very
limited
amount
of
game
may
be
sold
and
served
as
food
in
public
places
but
the
restrictions
placed
upon
this
traffic
are
so
effective
that
they
will
vastly
reduce
the
annual
slaughter
in
other
respects
also
the
cause
of
wild
life
protection
gained
much
for
which
great
credit
is
due
to
edward
mcilhenny
it
is
the
way
of
americans
to
feel
that
because
game
is
abundant
in
a
given
place
at
a
given
time
it
always
will
be
abundant
and
may
therefore
be
slaughtered
without
limit
that
was
the
case
last
winter
in
california
during
the
awful
slaughter
of
pigeons
as
will
be
noted
elsewhere
it
is
time
for
all
men
to
be
told
in
the
plainest
terms
that
there
never
has
existed
anywhere
in
historic
times
a
volume
of
wild
life
so
great
that
civilized
man
could
not
quickly
exterminate
it
by
his
methods
of
destruction
lift
the
veil
and
look
at
the
stories
of
the
bison
the
passenger
pigeon
the
wild
ducks
and
shore
birds
of
the
atlantic
coast
and
the
illustration
shall
we
leave
any
one
of
them
open
as
reasoning
beings
it
is
our
duty
to
heed
the
lessons
of
history
and
not
rush
blindly
on
until
we
perpetrate
a
continent
destitute
of
wild
life
chapter

extinct
species
of
north
american
birds
for
educated
civilized
man
to
exterminate
a
valuable
wild
species
of
living
things
is
a
crime
it
is
a
crime
against
his
own
children
and
posterity
no
man
has
a
right
either
moral
or
legal
to
destroy

man
the

fully
ten

will
lie
steal

destroy

wild

whenever

wherever
they
can
do
so
without
being
stopped
by

these
are
hard

they
are
absolutely
true
from
ten
per

or
more
of
the
human

the
high
moral
instinct
which
is
honest
without

the
things
that
seemingly
decent
citizens
men
posing
as
gentlemen
will
do
to
wild
game
when
they
secure
great
chances
to
slaughter
are
appalling
i
could
fill
a
book
of
this
size
with
cases
in
point
the
women
of
england
europe
and
elsewhere
are
directly
promoting
the
extermination
of
scores
of
beautiful
species
of
wild
birds
by
the
devilish
persistence
with
which
they
buy
and
wear
feather
ornaments
made
of
their
plumage
they
are
just
as
mean
and
cruel
as
the
who
drives
a
horse
with
a
sore
shoulder
and
beats
him
on
the
street
but
they
do
it
and
appeals
to
them
to
do
otherwise
they
laugh
to
scorn
saying
i
will
wear
what
is
fashionable
when
i
please
and
where
i
please
as
a
famous
bird
protector
of
england
has
just
written
me
the
women
of
the
smart
set
are
beyond
the
reach
of
appeal
or
protest
the
thing
that
stares
me
in
the
face
every
waking
hour
like
a
grisly
spectre
with
bloody
fang
and
claw
is
extermination
of
to
me
that
is
a
horrible
thing
it
is
wholesale
murder
no
less
it
is
capital
crime
and
a
black
disgrace
to
the
races
of
civilized
mankind
i
say
civilized
mankind
because
savages
do
do
it
there
are
three
kinds
of
extermination
practical
extermination
of
a
means
the
destruction
of
its
members
to
an
extent
so
thorough
and
widespread
that
the
species
disappears
from
view
and
living
specimens
of
it
can
not
be
found
by
seeking
for
them
in
north
america
this
is
the
status
of
the
whooping
crane
upland
plover
and
several
other
species
if
any
individuals
are
living
they
will
be
met
with
only
by
accident
absolute
of
a
species
means
that
not
one
individual
of
it
remains
alive
judgment
to
this
effect
is
based
upon
the
lapse
of
time
since
the
last
living
specimen
was
observed
or
killed
when
five
years
have
passed
without
a
living
record
of
a
wild
specimen
it
is
time
to
place
a
species
in
the
class
of
the
totally
extinct
in
a
wild
means
that
the
only
living
representatives
are
in
captivity
or
otherwise
under
protection
this
is
the
case
of
the
heath
hen
and
david
deer
of
china
the
american
bison
is
saved
from
being
wholly
extinct
as
a
wild
animal
by
the
remnant
of
about
head
in
northern
athabasca
and
head
in
the
park
it
is
a
serious
thing
to
exterminate
a
species
of
any
of
the
vertebrate
animals
there
are
probably
millions
of
people
who
do
not
realize
that
civilized
man
is
the
most
persistently
and
wickedly
wasteful
of
all
the
predatory
animals
the
lions
the
tigers
the
bears
the
eagles
and
hawks
serpents
and
the
fishes
all
live
by
destroying
life
but
they
kill
only
what
they
think
they
can
consume
if
something
is
by
chance
left
over
it
goes
to
satisfy
the
hunger
of
the
humbler
creatures
of
prey
a
state
of
nature
where
wild
creatures
prey
upon
wild
creatures
such
a
thing
as
wanton
wholesale
and
utterly
wasteful
slaughter
is
almost
unknown
when
the
wild
mink
weasel
and
skunk
suddenly
finds
himself
in
the
midst
of
scores
of
man
confined
and
helpless
domestic
fowls
or
his
caged
gulls
in
a
zoological
park
an
unusual
criminal
passion
to
murder
for
the
joy
of
killing
sometimes
seizes
the
wild
animal
and
great
slaughter
is
the
result
from
the
earliest
historic
times
it
has
been
the
way
of
savage
man
red
black
brown
and
yellow
to
kill
as
the
wild
animals
do
only
what
he
can
use
or
he
can
use
the
cree
indian
impounded
small
herds
of
bison
and
sometimes
killed
from
to
at
one
time
but
it
was
to
make
sure
of
having
enough
meat
and
hides
and
because
he
expected
to
use
the
product
i
think
that
even
the
worst
enemies
of
the
plains
indians
hardly
will
accuse
them
of
killing
large
numbers
of
bison
elk
or
deer
merely
for
the
pleasure
of
seeing
them
fall
or
taking
only
their
teeth

puts

the

must
be
classed
with
the
cruel
wolf
and
the
criminal

it
is
now
desirable
that
we
should
pause
in
our
career
of
destruction
long
enough
to
look
back
upon
what
we
have
recently
accomplished
in
the
total
extinction
of
species
and
also
note
what
we
have
blocked
out
for
the
immediate
future
here
let
us
erect
a
monument
to
the
dead
species
of
our
own
times
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
up
to
this
hour
any
man
has
made
a
list
of
the
species
of
north
american
birds
that
have
become
extinct
during
the
past
sixty
years
the
specialists
have
no
time
to
spare
from
their
compound
differential
microscopes
and
the
are
too
busy
with
shooting
netting
and
clubbing
to
waste
any
time
on
such
trifles
as
exterminated
species
what
does
a
care
about
birds
that
can
not
be
killed
a
second
time
as
for
the
farmers
they
are
so
busy
raising
hogs
and
prices
that
their
best
friends
the
birds
get
scant
attention
from
them
until
a
takes
a
chicken
down
south
the
negroes
and
poor
whites
may
slaughter
robins
for
food
by
the
ten
thousand
but
does
the
northern
farmer
bother
his
head
about
a
trifle
of
that
kind
no
indeed
will
he
contribute
any
real
money
to
help
put
a
stop
to
it
ask
him
yourself
let
us
pause
long
enough
to
reckon
up
some
of
our
expenditures
in
species
and
in
millions
of
individuals
let
us
set
down
here
in
cold
blood
a
list
of
the
species
of
our
own
north
american
birds
that
have
been
totally
exterminated
in
our
own
times
after
that
we
will
have
something
to
say
about
other
species
that
soon
will
be
exterminated
and
the
second
task
is
much
greater
than
the
first
roll
call
of
the
dead
species
of
american
birds
the
great
auk
linn
was
a
diving
bird
about
the
size
of
a
domestic
goose
related
to
the
guillemots
murres
and
puffins
for
a
bird
endowed
only
with
wings
and
therefore
absolutely
unable
to
fly
this
species
had
an
astonishing
geographic
range
it
embraced
the
shores
of
northern
europe
to
north
cape
southern
greenland
southern
labrador
and
the
atlantic
coast
of
north
america
as
far
south
as
massachusetts
some
say
as
far
south
as
massachusetts
the
carolinas
and
florida
but
that
is
a
large
order
and
i
leave
the
to
prove
that
if
it
can
in
the
life
history
of
this
bird
a
great
tragedy
was
enacted
in
by
sailors
on
funk
island
north
of
newfoundland
where
men
were
landed
by
a
ship
and
spent
several
months
slaughtering
great
auks
and
trying
out
their
fat
for
oil
in
this
process
the
bodies
of
thousands
of
auks
were
burned
as
fuel
in
working
up
the
remains
of
tens
of
thousands
of
others
on
funk
island
a
favorite
the
great
auk
was
exterminated
in
and
in
iceland
in
many
natives
ate
this
bird
with
relish
and
being
easily
captured
either
on
land
or
sea
the
commercialism
of
its
day
soon
obliterated
the
species
the
last
living
specimen
was
seen
in
and
the
last
dead
one
was
picked
up
in
trinity
bay
ireland
in
there
are
about
mounted
and
unmounted
skins
in
existence
four
skeletons
and
quite
a
number
of
eggs
an
egg
is
worth
about
and
a
good
mounted
skin
at
least
double
that
sum
the
labrador
duck
gmel
this
handsome
of
a
species
related
to
the
eider
ducks
of
arctic
waters
became
totally
extinct
about
before
the
scientific
world
even
knew
that
its
existence
was
threatened
with
this
species
the
exact
and
final
cause
of
its
extinction
is
to
this
day
unknown
it
is
not
at
all
probable
however
that
its
unfortunate
blotting
out
from
our
bird
fauna
was
due
to
natural
causes
and
when
the
truth
becomes
known
it
is
very
probable
that
the
hand
of
man
will
be
revealed
the
labrador
duck
bred
in
labrador
and
once
frequented
our
atlantic
coast
as
far
south
as
chesapeake
bay
but
it
is
said
that
it
never
was
very
numerous
at
least
during
the
years
preceding
its
disappearance
about
skins
and
mounted
museum
specimens
are
all
that
remain
to
prove
its
former
existence
and
i
think
there
is
not
even
one
skeleton
the
pallas
cormorant
pallas
in
when
the
russian
explorer
commander
bering
discovered
the
bering
or
commander
islands
in
the
pacific
and
landed
upon
them
he
also
discovered
this
striking
bird
species
its
plumage
both
above
and
below
was
a
dark
metallic
green
with
blue
iridescence
on
the
neck
and
purple
on
the
shoulders
a
pale
ring
of
naked
skin
around
each
eye
suggested
the
latin
specific
name
of
this
bird
the
pallas
cormorant
became
totally
extinct
through
causes
not
positively
known
about
the
passenger
pigeon
linn
we
place
this
bird
in
the
class
not
only
because
it
is
extinct
in
a
wild
state
but
only
one
solitary
individual
a
female
in
the
cincinnati
zoological
gardens
now
remains
alive
one
living
specimen
and
a
few
skins
skeletons
and
stuffed
specimens
are
all
that
remain
to
show
for
the
uncountable
millions
of
pigeons
that
swarmed
over
the
united
states
only
yesterday
as
it
were
there
is
no
doubt
about
where
those
millions
have
gone
they
went
down
and
out
by
systematic
wholesale
slaughter
for
the
market
and
the
pot
before
the
shotguns
and
of
the
earliest
american
wherever
they
nested
they
were
slaughtered
it
is
a
long
and
shameful
story
but
the
grisly
skeleton
of
its
michigan
chapter
can
be
set
forth
in
a
few
words
in
from
the
town
of
hartford
car
of
dead
pigeons
were
shipped
to
market
each
day
for
making
a
total
of
birds
it
is
recorded
that
another
michigan
town
marketed
in
two
years
see
mershon
book
the
passenger
pigeon
alexander
wilson
the
pioneer
american
ornithologist
was
the
man
who
seriously
endeavored
to
estimate
by
computations
the
total
number
of
passenger
pigeons
in
one
flock
that
was
seen
by
him
here
is
what
he
has
said
in
his
american
ornithology
to
form
a
rough
estimate
of
the
daily
consumption
of
one
of
these
immense
flocks
let
us
first
attempt
to
calculate
the
numbers
of
that
above
mentioned
as
seen
in
passing
between
frankfort
and
the
indiana
territory
if
we
suppose
this
column
to
have
been
one
mile
in
breadth
and
i
believe
it
to
have
been
much
more
and
that
it
moved
at
the
rate
of
one
mile
in
a
minute
four
hours
the
time
it
continued
passing
would
make
its
whole
length
two
hundred
and
forty
miles
again
supposing
that
each
square
yard
of
this
moving
body
comprehended
three
pigeons
the
square
yards
in
the
whole
space
multiplied
by
three
would
give
pigeons
an
almost
inconceivable
multitude
and
yet
probably
far
below
the
actual
amount
happening
to
go
ashore
one
charming
afternoon
to
purchase
some
milk
at
a
house
that
stood
near
the
river
and
while
talking
with
the
people
within
doors
i
was
suddenly
struck
with
astonishment
at
a
loud
rushing
roar
succeeded
by
instant
darkness
which
on
the
first
moment
i
took
for
a
tornado
about
to
overwhelm
the
house
and
every
thing
around
in
destruction
the
people
observing
my
surprise
coolly
said
is
only
the
pigeons
on
running
out
i
beheld
a
flock
thirty
or
forty
yards
in
width
sweeping
along
very
low
between
the
house
and
the
mountain
or
height
that
formed
the
second
bank
of
the
river
these
continued
passing
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
at
length
varied
their
bearing
so
as
to
pass
over
the
mountains
behind
which
they
disappeared
before
the
rear
came
up
in
the
atlantic
states
though
they
never
appear
in
such
unparalleled
multitudes
they
are
sometimes
very
numerous
and
great
havoc
is
then
made
amongst
them
with
the
gun
the
and
various
other
implements
of
destruction
as
soon
as
it
is
ascertained
in
a
town
that
the
pigeons
are
flying
numerously
in
the
neighborhood
the
gunners
rise
the
are
spread
out
on
suitable
situations
commonly
on
an
open
height
in
an
old
buckwheat
field
four
or
five
live
pigeons
their
eyelids
sewed
a
are
fastened
on
a
movable
stick
a
small
hut
of
branches
is
fitted
up
for
the
fowler
at
the
distance
of
forty
or
fifty
yards
by
the
pulling
of
a
string
the
stick
on
which
the
pigeons
rest
is
alternately
elevated
and
depressed
which
produces
a
fluttering
of
their
wings
similar
to
that
of
birds
alighting
this
being
perceived
by
the
passing
flocks
they
descend
with
great
rapidity
and
finding
corn
buckwheat
etc
strewed
about
begin
to
feed
and
are
instantly
by
the
pulling
of
a
cord
covered
by
the
net
in
this
manner
ten
twenty
and
even
thirty
dozen
have
been
caught
at
one
sweep
meantime
the
air
is
darkened
with
large
bodies
of
them
moving
in
various
directions
the
woods
also
swarm
with
them
in
search
of
acorns
and
the
thundering
of
musquetry
is
perpetual
on
all
sides
from
morning
to
night
wagon
loads
of
them
are
poured
into
market
where
they
sell
from
fifty
to
and
even
twelve
cents
per
dozen
and
pigeons
become
the
order
of
the
day
at
dinner
breakfast
and
supper
until
the
very
name
becomes
sickening
footnote
a
we
think
that
the
fowlers
of
the
roccolos
of
northern
italy
are
very
cruel
in
their
methods
of
catching
wholesale
for
the
market
chapter
xi
but
our
own
countrymen
of
wilson
day
were
just
as
cruel
in
the
method
described
above
the
range
of
the
passenger
pigeon
covered
nearly
the
whole
united
states
from
the
atlantic
coast
westward
to
the
rocky
mountains
a
few
bold
pigeons
crossed
the
rocky
mountains
into
oregon
northern
california
and
washington
but
only
as
stragglers
few
and
far
between
the
wide
range
of
this
bird
was
worthy
of
a
species
that
existed
in
millions
and
it
was
persecuted
literally
all
along
the
line
the
greatest
slaughter
was
in
michigan
ohio
and
pennsylvania
in
massachusetts
gravely
passed
a
law
protecting
the
of
wild
pigeons
from
foreign
interference
there
was
a
fine
of
for
damaging
nets
or
frightening
pigeons
away
from
them
this
was
on
the
theory
that
the
pigeons
were
so
abundant
they
could
not
by
any
possibility
ever
become
scarce
and
that
was
a
legitimate
industry
in
the
state
of
new
york
found
that
the
wild
pigeon
needed
protection
and
enacted
a
law
to
that
effect
the
year
was
the
last
year
in
which
great
numbers
of
passenger
pigeons
nested
in
that
state
eaton
in
the
birds
of
new
york
said
that
millions
of
birds
occupied
the
timber
along
bell
run
near
ceres
alleghany
county
on
the
pennsylvania
line
in
massachusetts
gave
pigeons
protection
except
during
an
open
season
and
in
pennsylvania
elected
to
protect
pigeons
on
their
nesting
grounds
the
passenger
pigeon
millions
were
destroyed
so
quickly
and
so
thoroughly
that
the
american
people
utterly
failed
to
comprehend
it
and
for
thirty
years
obstinately
refused
to
believe
that
the
species
had
been
suddenly
wiped
off
the
map
of
north
america
there
was
years
of
talk
about
the
great
flocks
having
taken
refuge
in
south
america
or
in
mexico
and
being
still
in
existence
there
were
surmises
about
their
having
all
gone
out
to
sea
and
perished
on
the
briny
deep
a
thousand
times
at
least
wild
pigeons
have
been
reported
as
having
been
seen
these
rumors
have
covered
nearly
every
northern
state
the
whole
of
the
southwest
and
california
for
years
and
years
we
have
been
patiently
writing
letters
to
explain
over
and
over
that
the
pigeon
of
the
pacific
coast
and
the
pigeon
of
arizona
and
the
southwest
are
neither
of
them
the
passenger
pigeon
and
never
can
be
there
was
a
long
period
wherein
we
believed
many
of
the
pigeon
reports
that
came
from
the
states
where
the
birds
once
were
most
numerous
but
that
period
has
absolutely
passed
during
the
past
five
years
large
cash
rewards
aggregating
about
have
been
offered
for
the
discovery
of
one
nesting
pair
of
genuine
passenger
pigeons
many
persons
have
claimed
this
reward
of
professor
hodge
of
clark
university
worcester
mass
and
many
claims
have
been
investigated
the
results
have
disclosed
many
but
not
one
pigeon
now
we
understand
that
the
quest
is
closed
and
hope
has
been
abandoned
the
passenger
pigeon
is
a
dead
species
the
last
wild
specimen
so
we
believe
that
ever
will
reach
the
hands
of
man
was
taken
near
detroit
michigan
on
and
mounted
by
campion
that
is
the
one
definite
positive
record
of
the
past
ten
years
the
fate
of
this
species
should
be
a
lasting
lesson
to
the
world
at
large
any
wild
bird
or
mammal
species
can
be
exterminated
by
commercial
interests
in
twenty
years
time
or
less
the
eskimo
curlew
numenius
this
valuable
game
bird
once
ranged
all
along
the
atlantic
coast
of
north
america
and
wherever
found
it
was
prized
for
the
table
it
preferred
the
fields
and
meadows
to
the
shore
lines
and
was
the
companion
of
the
plovers
of
the
uplands
especially
the
golden
plover
about
says
forbush
there
was
a
great
flight
of
these
birds
on
cape
cod
and
nantucket
they
were
everywhere
and
enormous
numbers
were
killed
they
could
be
bought
of
boys
at
six
cents
apiece
two
men
killed
worth
of
these
birds
at
that
time
apparently
that
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
the
dough
bird
which
was
another
name
for
this
curlew
in
mackay
stated
that
this
bird
and
the
golden
plover
had
decreased
per
cent
in
fifty
years
and
in
the
last
ten
years
of
that
period
per
cent
of
the
remainder
had
gone
now
says
forbush
ornithologists
believe
that
the
eskimo
curlew
is
practically
extinct
as
only
a
few
specimens
have
been
recorded
since
the
beginning
of
the
twentieth
century
the
very
last
record
is
of
two
specimens
collected
at
waco
york
county
nebraska
in
march
and
recorded
by
august
eiche
of
course
it
is
possible
that
other
individuals
may
still
survive
but
so
far
as
our
knowledge
extends
the
species
is
absolutely
dead
in
the
west
indies
and
the
guadeloupe
islands
five
species
of
macaws
and
parrakeets
have
passed
out
without
any
serious
note
of
their
disappearance
on
the
part
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
it
is
at
least
time
to
write
brief
obituary
notices
of
them
we
are
indebted
to
the
hon

for
essential

regarding

he
was

that
he
was
about
ten
years
too
late
to
find
this
fine

alive
it
was
exterminated

us
down
to
the
present
moment
to
this
charming
little
bird
we
are
in
the
very
act
of
bidding
everlasting
farewell
ten
specimens
remain
alive
in

six
of
which
are
in
the
cincinnati

garden
three
are
in

washington
zoological

one
is

regarding
wild
specimens
it
is
possible
that
some
yet
remain
in
some
obscure
and
corner
of
florida
but
it
is
extremely
doubtful
whether
the
world
ever
will
find
any
of
them
alive
minnie
moore
willson
of
kissimee
reports
the
species
as
totally
extinct
in
florida
unless
we
would
strain
at
a
gnat
we
may
just
as
well
enter
this
species
in
the
dead
class
for
there
is
no
reason
to
hope
that
any
more
wild
specimens
ever
will
be
found
the
former
range
of
this
species
embraced
the
whole
southeastern
and
central
united
states
from
the
gulf
it
extended
to
albany
northern
ohio
and
indiana
northern
iowa
nebraska
central
colorado
and
eastern
texas
from
which
it
will
be
seen
that
once
it
was
widely
distributed
it
was
shot
because
it
was
destructive
to
fruit
and
for
its
plumage
and
many
were
trapped
alive
to
be
kept
in
captivity
i
know
that
one
colony
near
the
mouth
of
the
sebastian
river
east
coast
of
florida
was
exterminated
in
by
a
local
hunter
and
i
regret
to
say
that
it
was
done
in
the
hope
of
selling
the
living
birds
to
a
new
york
by
holding
bags
over
the
holes
in
which
the
birds
were
nesting
the
entire
colony
of
about
birds
was
caught
everywhere
else
than
in
florida
the
carolina
parrakeet
has
long
been
extinct
in
a
flock
of
birds
was
seen
near
lake
okechobee
but
in
florida
many
calamities
can
overtake
a
flock
of
birds
in
eight
years
the
birds
in
captivity
are
not
breeding
and
so
far
as
perpetuation
by
them
is
concerned
they
are
only
one
remove
from
mounted

this
parrakeet
is
the
only
member
of
its
order
that
ranged
into
the
united

during
our
own
times
and
with
its
disappearance
the

of

to

his

is

its

is
the

of

there
are
circumstances
under

the

may
be
so
wanton
so
revolting

so
utterly
reprehensible

the
murder
of

species
consists
in
taking
from

that

of

if

the

would

the

certainly
one
of
the
most
wonderful
animals
still
surviving
is
actually
being
exterminated
and
even
the
people
of

are
viewing
it
with
an
indifference
that
is
appalling
of
course
there
are
among

a

who
really

they
do
not

we
stand
in
awe
and
wonder
before
the

of

and
the

struggle
to
unveil
its
past
while
the
equally
great

marvel
at

a

in

excuses

these

at

not

but
in
the
faint
hope
of
somewhere
and
somehow
arousing
forces
that
will
reform
the
present
and
save
the

the
extermination
of
wild

that
now
is
proceeding
throughout
the

is
a
dreadful
thing
it
is
not

injurious
to

but
it
is
a
shame
and
a
disgrace
to

it
is
of
little
avail
that
i
should
here
enter
into
a

of
each

that
now
is
being
railroaded
into

the

wherein
the

may
be
determined
almost
without

there
is

to
notice

of
the

it
is
the
only
new
world
rival
of
the
numerous
large
and
showy
cranes
of
the
old
world
for
the
sandhill
crane
is
not
in
the
same
class
as
the
white
black
and
blue
giants
of
asia
we
will
part
from
our
stately
with
profound
sorrow
for
on
this
continent
we
shall
see
his
like
again
the
total
disappearance
of
this
species
has
been
brought
close
home
to
us
by
the
fact
that
there
are
less
than
half
a
dozen
individuals
alive
in
captivity
while
in
a
wild
state
the
bird
is
so
rare
as
to
be
quite
unobtainable
for
example
for
nearly
five
years
an
english
gentlemen
has
been
offering
for
a
pair
and
the
most
enterprising
bird
collector
in
america
has
been
quite
unable
to
fill
the
order
so
far
as
our
information
extends
the
last
living
specimen
captured
was
taken
six
or
seven
years
ago
the
last
wild
birds
seen
and
reported
were
observed
by
ernest
thompson
seton
who
saw
five
below
fort
mcmurray
saskatchewan
october
and
by
john
ferry
who
saw
one
at
big
quill
lake
saskatchewan
in
june
the
range
of
this
species
once
covered
the
eastern
of
the
continent
of
north
america
it
extended
from
the
atlantic
coast
to
the
rocky
mountains
and
from
great
bear
lake
to
florida
and
texas
eastward
of
the
mississippi
it
has
for
twenty
years
been
totally
extinct
and
the
last
specimens
taken
alive
were
found
in
kansas
and
nebraska
illustration
whooping

in
the
zoological
park
very
soon
this
species
will
become
totally
extinct
the
trumpeter
six
years
ago
this
species
was
regarded
as
so
nearly
extinct
that
a
doubting
ornithological
club
of
boston
refused
to
believe
on
hearsay
evidence
that
the
new
york
zoological
park
contained
a
pair
of
living
birds
and
a
committee
was
appointed
to
investigate
in
person
and
report
even
at
that
time
skins
were
worth
all
the
way
from
to
each
and
when
swan
skins
sell
at
either
of
those
figures
it
is
because
there
are
people
who
believe
that
the
species
either
is
on
the
verge
of
extinction
or
has
passed
it
the
pair
referred
to
above
was
acquired
in
since
that
time
leonard
sanford
procured
in
two
living
birds
from
a
bird
dealer
who
obtained
them
on
the
coast
of
virginia
we
have
done
our
utmost
to
induce
our
pair
to
breed
but
without
any
further
results
than
the
loss
of
the
trumpeter
swan
will
not
be
so
great
nor
felt
so
keenly
as
the
blotting
out
of
the
whooping
crane
it
so
closely
resembles
the
whistling
swan
that
only
an
ornithologist
can
recognize
the
difference
a
yellow
spot
on
the
side
of
the
upper
mandible
near
its
base
the
whistling
swan
yet
remains
in
fair
numbers
but
it
is
to
be
feared
that
soon
it
will
go
as
the
trumpeter
has
gone
the
american
flamingo
scarlet
ibis
and
roseate
spoonbill
are
three
of
the
most
beautiful
and
curious
birds
of
the
tropics
once
all
three
species
inhabited
portions
of
the
southern
united
states
but
now
all
three
are
gone
from
our
bird
fauna
the
brilliant
scarlet
plumage
of
the
flamingo
and
ibis
and
the
exquisite
pink
and
white
of
the
spoonbill
naturally
attracted
the
evil
eyes
of
the
milliner
taxidermists
and
other
from
florida
these
birds
quickly
vanished
the
six
great
breeding
colonies
of
flamingoes
on
andros
island
bahamas
have
been
reduced
to
two
and
from
goeldi
of
the
state
museum
goeldi
para
brazil
have
come
bitter
complaints
of
the
slaughter
of
scarlet
ibises
in
south
america
by
in
european
pay
i
know
not
how
other
naturalists
regard
the
future
of
the
three
species
named
above
but
my
opinion
is
that
unless
the
european
feather
trade
is
quickly
stopped
as
to
wild
plumage
they
are
absolutely
certain
to
be
shot
into
total
oblivion
within
a
very
few
years
the
plumage

this

it
appears
that
this
may
not
as
yet
be
absolutely
true
on
january
a
strange
thing
happened
a
much
battered

exhausted
petrel
was
picked
up
alive
in
central

taken
to
the
menagerie
and
kept
there
during

few
days
that
it
survived
when
it
died
it
was
sent

this
may
easily
prove
to
be
the
last

this

once
had
a
wide

it
is
recorded
from
ulster

kentucky
ohio
virginia
and
florida
it
was
about
of
the
size
of
the
common
tern
the
california
condor
i
feel
that
the
existence
of
this
species
hangs
on
a
very
slender
thread
this
is
due
to
its
alarmingly
small
range
the
insignificant
number
of
individuals
now
living
the
openness
of
the
species
to
attack
and
the
danger
of
its
extinction
by
poison
originally
this
remarkable
bird
the
largest
north
american
bird
of
prey
ranged
as
far
northward
as
the
columbia
river
and
southward
for
an
unknown
distance
now
its
range
is
reduced
to
seven
counties
in
southern
california
although
it
is
said
to
extend
from
monterey
bay
to
lower
california
and
eastward
to
arizona
regarding
the
present
status
and
the
future
of
this
bird
i
have
been
greatly
disturbed
in
mind
when
a
unique
and
zoologically
important
species
becomes
reduced
in
its
geographic
range
to
a
small
section
of
a
single
state
it
seems
to
me
quite
time
for
alarm
for
some
time
i
have
counted
this
bird
as
one
of
those
threatened
with
early
extermination
and
as
i
think
with
good
reason
in
view
of
the
swift
calamities
that
now
seem
able
to
fall
on
species
like
thunderbolts
out
of
clear
skies
and
wipe
them
off
the
earth
even
before
we
know
that
such
a
fate
is
impending
no
species
of
distribution
is
safe
any
species
that
is
limited
to
a
few
counties
of
a

is
liable
to
be
wiped
out

zoological

on
order
to
obtain
the
best
and
also
the
most
conservative
information
regarding
this
species
i
appealed
to
the
curator
of
the
museum
of
vertebrate
zoology
of
the
university
of
california
although
written
in
the
mountain
wilds
i
promptly
received
the
valuable
contribution
that
appears
below
as
a
clear
precise
and
conservative
survey
of
an
important
species
it
is
really
a
model
document
the
status
of
the
california
condor
in
joseph
to
my
knowledge
the
california
condor
has
been
definitely
observed
within
the
past
five
years
in
the
following
california
counties
los
angeles
ventura
santa
barbara
san
luis
obispo
monterey
kern
and
tulare
in
parts
of
ventura
santa
barbara
san
luis
obispo
and
kern
counties
the
species
is
still
fairly
common
for
a
large
bird
probably
equal
in
numbers
to
the
golden
eagle
in
those
regions
that
are
suited
to
it
by
suitable
country
i
mean
mountainous
territory
of
which
there
are
still
vast
areas
and
which
are
not
likely
to
be
put
to
any
other
use
for
a
very
long
time
if
ever
on
account
of
the
lack
of
water
while
in
kern
county
last
april
i
was
informed
by
a
reliable
man
who
lives
near
the
tejon
rancho
that
he
had
counted
condors
in
a
single
day
since
january
of
the
present
year
these
were
on
the
tejon
rancho
which
is
an
enormous
cattle
range
covering
parts
of
the
tehachapi
and
san
emigdio
mountains
our
present
state
law
provides
complete
protection
for
the
condor
and
its
eggs
and
the
state
fish
and
game
commission
in
granting
permits
for
collectors
always
adds
the
phrase
the
california
condor
and
its
eggs
i
know
of
two
special
permits
having
been
issued
but
neither
of
these
were
used
that
is
no
have
been
taken
since
as
far
as
i
am
aware
in
my
travels
about
the
state
i
have
found
that
practically
everyone
knows
that
the
condor
is
protected
still
there
is
always
the
hunting
element
who
do
not
hesitate
to
shoot
anything
alive
and
out
of
the
ordinary
and
a
certain
percentage
of
the
condors
are
doubtless
picked
off
each
year
by
such
criminals
it
is
possible
also
that
the
mercenary
continues
to
take
his
annual
rents
though
if
this
is
done
it
is
kept
very
quiet
it
is
my
impression
that
the
present
fatalities
from
all
sources
are
fully
balanced
by
the
natural
rate
of
increase
there
is
one
factor
that
has
militated
against
the
condor
more
than
any
other
one
thing
namely
the
restriction
in
its
food
source
its
forage
range
formerly
included
most
of
the
great
valleys
adjacent
to
its
mountain
retreats
but
now
the
valleys
are
almost
entirely
devoted
to
agriculture
and
of
course
far
more
thickly
settled
than
formerly
the
mountainous
areas
where
the
condor
is
making
its
last
stand
seem
to
me
likely
to
remain
adapted
to
the
bird
existence
for
many
years
fifty
years
if
not
longer
of
course
this
is
conditional
upon
the
maintenance
and
enforcement
of
the
present
laws
there
is
also
the
enlightenment
of
public
sentiment
in
regard
to
the
preservation
of
wild
life
which
i
believe
can
be
depended
upon
this
is
a
matter
of
general
education
which
is
fortunately
and
with
no
doubt
whatever
progressing
at
a
quite
perceptible
rate
yes
i
should
say
that
the
condor
has
a
fair
chance
to
survive
in
limited
numbers
another
bird
which
in
my
opinion
is
far
nearer
extinction
than
the
condor
so
far
as
california
is
concerned
is
the
kite
this
is
a
perfectly
harmless
bird
but
one
which
harries
over
the
marshes
where
it
has
been
an
easy
target
for
the
idle
then
too
its
range
was
limited
to
the
valley
bottoms
where
human
settlement
is
increasingly
close
i
know
of
only
live
pairs
within
the
state
last
year
finally
let
me
remark
that
the
rate
of
increase
of
the
california
condor
is
not
one
whit
less
than
that
of
the
pigeon
yet
there
is
no
protection
at
all
for
the
latter
in
this
state
even
in
the
nesting
season
and
thousands
were
shot
last
spring
in
the
unprecedented
concentration
of
the
species
in
the
southern
coast
counties
see
chambers
in
for
may
p
the
california
condor
is
one
of
the
only
two
species
of
condor
now
living
and
it
is
the
only
one
found
in
north
america
as
a
matter
of
national
pride
and
a
duty
to
posterity
the
people
of
the
united
states
can
far
better
afford
to
lose
a
million
dollars
from
their
national
treasury
than
to
allow
that
bird
to
become
extinct
its
preservation
for
all
coming
time
is
distinctly
a
white
man
burden
upon
the
state
of
california
the
laws
now
in
force
for
the
condor
protection
are
not
half
adequate
i
think
there
is
no
law
by
which
the
accidental
poisoning
of
those
birds
by
baits
put
out
for
coyotes
and
foxes
can
be
stopped
a
law
to
prevent
the
use
of
poisoned
meat
baits
anywhere
in
southern
california
should
be
enacted
at
the
next
session
of
legislature
the
fine
for
molesting
a
condor
should
be
raised
to
with
a
long
as
an
alternative
a
competent
interested
game
warden
should
be
appointed
for
the
protection
of
the
it
is

to
count

birds
keep
them
under

species

too

it
was

species

only
in
one
locality
the
island
of
vineyard
and
concerning
its
present
status
forbush
has
recently
furnished
us
the
following
clear
statement
the
heath
hens
increased
for
two
years
after
the
massachusetts
fish
and
game
commission
established
a
reservation
for
them
but
in
they
had
not
increased
there
are
probably
about
two
hundred
birds
extant
i
found
a
great
many
marsh
hawks
on
the
island
and
the
commission
did
not
kill
them
believing
them
to
be
beneficial
in
watching
them
i
concluded
that
they
were
catching
the
young
heath
hens
a
large
number
of
these
hawks
have
been
shot
and
their
stomachs
sent
to
washington
for
examination
as
i
was
too
busy
at
the
time
to
examine
them
so
far
as
i
know
no
report
of
the
examination
has
been
made
but
field
himself
examined
a
few
of
the
stomachs
and
found
the
remains
of
the
heath
hen
in
some
the
warden
now
says
that
during
the
past
two
years
the
heath
hen
has
not
increased
but
i
can
give
you
no
definite
evidence
of
this
i
am
quite
sure
they
are
being
killed
by
natives
of
the
island
and
that
at
least
one
collector
supplies
birds
for
museums
we
are
trying
to
get
evidence
of
this
i
believe
if
the
heath
hen
is
to
be
increased
in
numbers
and
brought
back
to
this
country
we
shall
have
to
have
more
than
one
warden
on
the
reservation

eventually
we
shall
have
to
establish

the
mainland

in

we
have
no

to

all

of

will
permit
any
one
of

to

prevail

this
period
that
the
parent
birds
are
killed
for
their
plumes
and
the
young
starve
in

nest
photo
by

three
years
ago
i
think
there
were
not
many
in
the
united
states
who
believed
it
possible
to
prevent
the
total
extinction
of
both
egrets
from
our
fauna
all
the
known
rookeries
accessible
to
had
been
totally
destroyed
two
years
ago
the
secret
discovery
of
several
small
hidden
colonies
prompted
william
dutcher
president
of
the
national
association
of
audubon
societies
and
gilbert
pearson
secretary
to
attempt
the
protection
of
those
colonies
with
a
fund
contributed
for
the
purpose
wardens
were
hired
and
duly
commissioned
as
previously
stated
one
of
those
wardens
was
shot
dead
in
cold
blood
by
a
plume
hunter
the
task
of
guarding
swamp
rookeries
from
the
attacks
of
desperadoes
to
whom
the
accursed
plumes
were
worth
their
weight
in
gold
is
a
very
chancy
proceeding
there
is
now
one
warden
in
florida
who
says
that
before
they
get
my
rookery
they
will
first
have
to
get
me
thus
far
the
protective
work
of
the
audubon
association
has
been
successful
now
there
are
twenty
colonies
which
contain
all
told
about
egrets
and
about
herons
and
ibises
which
are
guarded
by
the
audubon
wardens
one
of
the
most
important
is
on
bird
island
a
mile
out
in
orange
lake
central
florida
and
it
is
ably
defended
by
oscar
baynard
the
plume
hunters
who
do
not
dare
to
raid
the
guarded
rookeries
are
trying
to
study
out
the
lines
of
flight
of
the
birds
to
and
from
their
and
shoot
them
in
transit
their
motto
is
anything
to
beat
the
law
and
get
the
plumes
it
is
there
that
the
state
of
florida
should
take
part
in
the
war
the
success
of
this
campaign
is
attested
by
the
fact
that
last
year
a
number
of
egrets
were
seen
in
eastern
massachusetts
for
the
first
time
in
many
years
and
so
the
question
is
can
the
wardens
continue
to
hold
the
at
bay
the
by
many
regarded
as
the
most
beautiful
of
all
american
birds
is
threatened
with
extinction
in
all
the
states
that
it
still
inhabits
with
the
exception
of
eight
long
ago
the
biological
survey
sounded
a
general
alarm
for
this
species
by
the
issue
of
a
special
bulletin
regarding
its
disappearance
and
advising
its
protection
by
long
close
seasons
to
their
everlasting
honor
eight
states
responded
by
the
enactment
of
long

i
am
ashamed
to

it
is

that
the
truth
should
be
known
surely
we
will
find
that
if
the
other
states
have
not
the
grace
to
protect
this
bird
on
account
of
its
exquisite
beauty
they
will
not
penalize
it
by
extra
long
open
seasons
number
of
them
have
taken
pains
to
provide
extra
open
on
this
species
usually
of
five
or
six
months
and
this
for
a

something
to

too

the
woodcock
philohela
minor
is
a
bird
regarding
which
my
friends
and
i
do
not
agree
i
say
that
as
a
species
it
is
steadily
disappearing
and
presently
will
become
extinct
unless
it
is
accorded
better
protection
they
reply
well
i
can
show
you
where
there
are
woodcock
yet
a
few
months
ago
a
nova
scotian
writer
in
and
came
out
with
the
bold
prediction
that
three
more
years
of
the
usual
annual
slaughter
of
woodcock
will
bring
the
species
to
the
verge
of
extinction
in
that
province
it
is
such
occurrences
as
this
that
bring
the
end
of
a
species
last
fall
at
norwalk
we
had
a
good
flight
of
woodcock
and
it
is
a
shame
the
way
they
were
slaughtered
i
know
of
a
number
of
cases
where
twenty
were
killed
by
one
gun
in
the
day
and
heard
of
one
case
of
fifty
this
is
all
wrong
and
means
the
end
of
the
woodcock
if
continued
there
is
no
doubt
we
need
a
bag
limit
on
woodcock
as
much
as
on
quail
or
partridge
woodcock
in
and
mar
as
far
back
as
fisher
of
the
biological
survey
predicted
that
the
woodcock
and
would
both
become
extinct
unless
better
protected
as
yet
the
better
protection
demanded
has
not
materialized
to
any
great
extent
says
forbush
state
ornithologist
of
massachusetts
in
his
admirable
special
report
the
woodcock
is
decreasing
all
over
its
range
in
the
east
and
needs
the
strongest
protection
of
massachusetts
reports
state
that
woodcock
are
decreasing
rare
or
extinct
while
one
states
that
they
are
holding
their
own
and
one
that
they
are
increasing
slightly
since
the
law
was
passed
prohibiting
their
sale
let
not
any
honest
american
or
canadian
sportsman
lullaby
himself
into
the
belief
that
the
woodcock
is
safe
from
extermination
as
sure
as
the
world
it
is
the
fact
that
a
little
pocket
here
or
there
contains
a
few
birds
does
not
in
the
slightest
degree
disprove
the
main
fact
if
the
sportsmen
of
this
country
desire
to
save
the
seed
stock
of
woodcock
they
must
give
it
five
or
close
seasons
and
it
our
shore
birds
in
this
group
of
game
birds
will
be
the
first
to
be
exterminated
in
north
america
as
a
of
all
our
birds
these
are
the
most
illy
fitted
to
survive
they
are
very
conspicuous
very
unwary
easy
to
find
if
alive
and
easy
to
shoot
never
in
my
life
have
any
shore
birds
except
woodcock
and
snipe
appealed
to
me
as
real
game
they
are
too
easy
to
kill
too
trivial
when
killed
and
some
of
them
are
too
rank
and
fishy
on
the
plate
as
game
for
men
i
place
them
on
a
level
with
barnyard
ducks
or
orchard
turkeys
i
would
as
soon
be
caught
stealing
a
sheep
as
to
be
seen
trying
to
shoot
fishy
yellow
legs
or
little
joke
sandpipers
for
the
purpose
of
feeding
upon
them
and
yet
thousands
of
men
some
of
them
six
feet
high
grow
indignant
and
turn
red
in
the
face
at
the
mention
of
a
law
to
give
all
the
of
new
york
a
close
season
but
for
all
that
gentlemen
of
the
gun
there
are
exactly
two
alternatives
between
which
you
shall
choose
either
give
the
woodcock
of
the
eastern
united
states
just
the
protection
that
it
now
has
or
bid
the
species
a
long
farewell
if
you
elect
to
slaughter
old
on
the
altar
of
selfishness
then
it
will
be
in
order
for
the
millions
of
people
who
do
not
kill
birds
to
say
whether
that
proposal
shall
be
consummated
or
not
read

on

vanishing
shore
birds
reproduced
in
full
in
chapter
xxiii
he
says
throughout
the
eastern
united
states
shore
birds
are
fast
vanishing
many
of
them
have
been
so
reduced
that
seems
so
averse
to
shore
birds
are
present
conditions
of
slaughter
that
the
wonder
is
that
any
escape
all
the
shore
birds
of
the
united
states
are
in
great
need
of
better
protection
shore
birds
have
been
hunted
until
only
a
remnant
of
their
once
vast
numbers
are
left
their
limited
powers
of
reproduction
coupled
with
the
natural
vicissitudes
of
the
breeding
period
make
their
increase
slow
and
peculiarly
expose
them
to
danger
of
extermination
so
great
is
their
economic
value
that
their
retention
in
the
game
list
and
their
destruction
by
sportsmen
is
a
serious
loss
to
agriculture
and
yet
here
in
new
york
state
there
are
many
men
who
think
they
know
who
indignantly
scoff
at
the
idea
that
our
shore
birds
need
a
close
season
to
help
save
them
from
annihilation
the
appeal
for
this
at
a
recent
convention
of
the
new
york
state
fish
game
and
forest
league
fell
upon
deaf
ears
and
was
not
even
seriously
discussed
the
must
be
saved
and
just
at
present
it
seems
that
the
only
persons
who
will
do
it
are
those
who
are
sportsmen
and
who
never
kill
game
if
the
sportsmen
persist
in
refusing
to
act
to
them
we
must
appeal
besides
the
woodcock
and
snipe
the
species
that
are
most
seriously
threatened
with
extinction
at
an
early
date
are
the
following
species
in
great
danger
willet
dowitcher
knot
sandpiper
upland
plover
golden
plover
pectoral
sandpiper
of
these
fine
species
forbush
whose
excellent
knowledge
of
the
shore
birds
of
the
atlantic
coast
is
well
worth
the
most
serious
consideration
says
that
the
upland
plover
or
bartramian
sandpiper
is
in
imminent
danger
of
extinction
five
reports
from
localities
where
this
bird
formerly
bred
give
it
as
nearing
extinction
and
four
as
extinct
this
is
one
of
the
most
useful
of
all
birds
in
grass
land
feeding
largely
on
grasshoppers
and
cutworms
there
is
no
difference
of
opinion
in
regard
to
the
diminution
of
the
shore
birds
the
reports
from
all
quarters
are
the
same
it
is
noteworthy
that
practically
all
observers
agree
that
considering
all
species
these
birds
have
fallen
off
about
per
cent
within
to
forty
years
and
that
several
species
are
nearly
extirpated

the

published
my
report
on
the
extermination
of
our
birds
and

we
put
down
the
decrease
in
the
volume
of
bird
life
in
massachusetts
during
the
previous
fifteen
years
at
per
cent
the

more
elaborate

have
satisfactorily
vindicated
the
accuracy
of
that
estimate
there
are
other
north
american
birds
that
easily
might
be
added
to
the
list
of
those
now
on
the
road
to
oblivion
but
surely
the
foregoing
citations
are
sufficient
to
reveal
the
present
desperate
conditions
of
our
bird
life
in
general
now
the
question
is
what
are
the
great
american
people
going
to
do
about
it
the

the
gray
squirrel
is
in
danger
of
extermination
although
it
is
our
most
beautiful
and
companionable
small
wild
animal
and
really
unfit
for
food
americans
have
strangely
elected
to
class
it
as
game
and
shoot
it
to
death
and
this
in
america
in
the
twentieth
century
americans
are
the
only
white
people
in
the
world
who
eat
squirrels
it
would
be
just
as
reasonable
and
no
more
barbarous
to
kill
domestic
cats
and
eat
them
their
flesh
would
taste
quite
as
good
as
squirrel
flesh
and
some
of
them
would
afford
quite
as
good
sport
every
intelligent
person
knows
that
in
the
united
states
the
deadly
is
rapidly
exterminating
every
bird
and
every
small
mammal
that
is
classed
as
game
and
which
legally
may
be
killed
even
during
two
months
of
the

as
if

the
beautiful

has
clung
to
life
in
a
few
of
our
forests
and
long
after
most
other
wild
mammals
have
disappeared
but
throughout
at
least
per
cent
of
its
original
area
it
is
now
extinct
during
the

thirty

have
roamed
the
woods
of
my
state
in
several
widely
separated
localities
the
adirondacks
catskills
berkshires
western
new

and
elsewhere
and
in
all
that
time
i
have
seen
only
wild
gray
squirrels
outside
of
city
parks
except
over
a
very
small
total
area
the
gray
squirrel
is
already
gone
from
the
wild
fauna
of
new
york
state
do
the
people
of
america
wish
to
have
this
beautiful
animal
entirely
exterminated
do
they
wish
the
woods
to
become
wholly
lifeless
or
do
they
desire
to
bring
back
some
of
the
wild
creatures
and
keep
them
for
their
children
to
enjoy
there
is
no
wild
mammal
that
responds
to
protection
more
quickly
than
the
gray
squirrel
in
two
years
time
wild
specimens
that
are
set
free
in
city
parks
learn
that
they
are
safe
from
harm
and
become
almost
fearless
they
take
food
from
the
hands
of
visitors
and
climb
into
their
arms
one
of
the
most
pleasing
sights
of
the
zoological
park
is
the
enjoyment
of
visitors
young
and
old
in
petting
our
wild
gray
squirrels
we
ask
the
boy
scouts
of
america
to
bring
back
this
animal
to
each
state
where
it
belongs
by
securing
for
it
from
legislatures
and
governors
the
perpetual
closed
seasons
that
it
imperatively
needs
it
is
not
much
to
ask
this
can
be
done
by
writing
to
members
of
the
legislatures
and
requesting
a
suitable
law
such
a
request
will
be
both
right
and
reasonable
and
three
states
have
already
granted
it
the
gray
squirrel
is
naturally
the
children
closest
friend
surely
every
farmer
boy
would
like
to
have
colonies
of
gray
squirrels
around
him
to
keep
him
company
and
furnish
him
with
entertainment
a
without
squirrels
and
chipmunks
is
indeed
a

place
for
anyone
can
restock
any
bit
of
woods
with
the
most
companionable
and
most
beautiful
that
nature
has
given
us
the
question
now
is
which
will
you
choose
a
gray
squirrel
colony
to
every

desolation
we
ask
every
american
to
lend

we

we
are

wickedly
destroyed

man
during

species
that
had
they
been
given
a

would

that
its
final
extinction
occurred
about
its
extermination
was
only
a
routine
incident
of
the
devilish
general
slaughter
of
american
big
game
that
by
had
wiped
out
nearly
everything
killable
over
a
large
portion
of
the
rocky
mountain
region
and
the
great
plains
the
arizona
elk
was
exterminated
before
the
separate
standing
of
the
species
had
been
discovered
by
naturalists
and
before
even

had
been
preserved

has
been
discovered
by

a

of

zoological
society
and
presented
to
our
national
collection
of

and

it
came
from
the
santa
catalina
mountains
arizona
in
the
species
was
first
exterminated
in
the
central
and
northern
mountains
of
arizona
probably
twenty
years
ago
and
made
its
last
stand
in
northwestern
new
mexico
precisely
when
it
became
extinct
there
its
last
abiding
place
we
do
not
know
but
in
time
the
facts
may
appear
the
quagga
before
the
days
of
livingstone
and
anderson
the
grassy
plains
and
hills
of
south
africa
were
inhabited
by
great
herds
of
a
wild
equine
species
that
in
its
markings
was
a
sort
of
connecting
link
between
the
striped
zebras
and
the
stripeless
wild
asses
the
quagga
resembled
a
wild
ass
with
a
few
zebra
stripes
around
its
neck
and
no
stripes
elsewhere
there
is
no
good
reason
why
a
mammal
that
is
not
in
any
one
of
the
families
regularly
eaten
by
man
should
be
classed
as
a
game
animal
white
men
outside
of
the
western
border
of
the
continent
of
europe
do
not
eat
horses
and
by
this
token
there
is
no
reason
why
a
zebra
should
be
shot
as
a
game
animal
any
more
than
a
baboon
a
big
male
baboon
is
dangerous
a
male
zebra
is
not
nevertheless
white
men
have
elected
to
shoot
zebras
as
game
and
under
this
curse
the
unfortunate
quagga
fell
to
rise
no
more
the
species
was
shot
to
a
speedy
death
by
sportsmen
and
by
the
british
and
dutch
farmers
of
south
africa
it
became
extinct
about
and
there
are
only
specimens
in
all
the
museums
of
the
world
the
blaubok
the
first
of
the
african
antelopes
to
become
extinct
in
modern
times
was
a
species
of
large
size
closely
related
to
the
roan
antelope
of
and
named
by
the
early
dutch
settlers
of
cape
colony
the
blaubok
which
means
it
was
snuffed
out
of
existence
in
the
year
so
quickly
and
so
thoroughly
that
like
the
arizona
elk
it
very
nearly
escaped
the
annals
of
natural
history
according
to
the
careful
investigations
of
graham
renshaw
there
are
only
eight
specimens
in
existence
in
all
the
museums
of
europe
in
general
terms
it
may
be
stated
that
this
species
has
been
extinct
for
about
a
century
david
deer
we
enter
this
species
with
those
that
are
totally
extinct
because
this
is
true
of
it
so
far
as
its
wild
state
is
concerned
it
is
a
deer
nearly
as
large
as
the
red
deer
of
europe
with
antlers
about
equal
in
total
length
to
those
of
the
red
deer
its
most
striking
differential
character
is
its
a
feature
that
among
the
deer
of
the
world
is
quite
unique
originally
this
species
inhabited
northern
mongolia
china
but
in
a
wild
state
it
became
extinct
before
its
zoological
standing
became
known
to
the
scientific
world
the
species
was
called
to
the
attention
of
zoologists
by
a
roman
catholic
missionary
called
father
david
and
when
finally
described
it
was
named
in
his
honor
at
the
outbreak
of
the
boxer
rebellion
in
there
were
about
specimens
living
in
the
imperial
park
of
china
a
short
distance
south
of
pekin
but
during
the
rebellion
all
of
them
were
killed
and
eaten
thus
totally
exterminating
the
species
from
asia
fortunately
previous
to
that
calamity
in
the
duke
of
bedford
had
by
considerable
effort
and
expenditure
procured
and
established
in
his
matchless
park
surrounding
woburn
abbey
england
a
herd
of
eighteen
specimens
of
this
rarest
of
all
deer
that
nucleus
has
thriven
and
increased
until
in
it
contained
head
owing
to
the
fact
that
all
the
living
female
specimens
of
this
remarkable
species
are
concentrated
in
one
spot
and
perfectly
liable
to
be
wiped
out
in
one
year
by
riot
war
or
disease
there
is
some
cause
for
anxiety
the
writer
has
gone
so
far
as
to
suggest
the
desirability
of
starting
a
new
herd
of
david
deer
at
some
point
far
distant
from
england
as
an
insurance
measure
against
the
possibility
of
calamity
at
woburn
excepting
two
or
three
specimens
in
european
zoological
gardens
that
have
been
favored
by
the
duke
of
bedford
there
are
no
living
specimens
outside
of

by
steller

must
have

belonged
to
the

mammalian
order
as

the
largest
manatee
that
florida
has

was
thirteen

the

attained
a

thirty

feet
and
a
weight
of
pounds
or
over
the
flesh
of
this
animal
like
that
of
the
manatee
and
dugong
must
have
been
edible
and
surely
was
prized
by
the
hungry
sailors
and
natives
of
its
time
it
is
not
strange
that
such
a
species
was
quickly
exterminated
by
man
in
the
arctic
regions
the
wonder
is
that
it
ever
existed
at
a
latitude
so
outrageous
for
a
sirenian
an
animal
which
by
all
precedents
should
prefer
life
in
temperate

warm

you
never

the

she
states
that
the
mountain
home
of

is
now
occupied
by

of

and
because
of
the
fact
that
the
tasmanian

raid
the

kill

are
systematically

all
the
zoologists
who
ever
had
heard
of
this
species
believed
that
the
had
completely
exterminated
it
in
when
the
national

came
into

of
one

it
was
regarded
as
a
great
most
unexpectedly
in
american
zoologists
were
startled
by
the
discovery
of

on

in
the
caribbean
sea
near
yucatan
by
henry
ward
now

of

they
found
about
twenty

only
a
sufficient
number
to
establish
the
true
character

were
the
sluggish

that

hangs

some

will
pounce
upon

wipe
it
out

from
the

for
at

fifteen

six

proposition
to
go
to
those

one

could
land
on

in

is
who
will

to
do
it

those
seals
have
no
commercial
value
whatsoever
the
little
oil
they
would

would
not
pay
the

the

it

it

to
say
whether
any

how
long
it

of
his

can

no

general
californian
apathy
why
the

the

not

what

add
other
notes
and
observations
of
interest
at
this
time
alabama
snowy
egret
woodcock
the
worst
enemy
of
wild
life
is
the
and
game
hog
these
wholesale
slaughterers
of
game
resort
to
any
device
and
practice
it
matters
not
how
murderous
to
accomplish
the
pernicious
ends
of
their
nefarious
campaign
of
relentless
extermination
of
fur
and
feather
they
can
not
be
controlled
by
local
laws
for
these
after
having
been
tried
for
several
generations
have
proven
consummate
failures
for
the
reason
that
local
authorities
will
not
enforce
the
provisions
of
game
and
bird
protective
statutes
experience
has
demonstrated
the
fact
that
no
one
desires
to
inform
voluntarily
on
his
neighbors
and
since
breaking
the
game
law
is
not
construed
to
involve
moral
turpitude
even
to
an
infinitesimal
degree
by
many
of
our
citizens
the
plunderers
of
nature
storehouse
thus
go
free
it
matters
not
how
great
the
damage
done
to
the
people
as
a
whole
john
wallace
game
commissioner
of
alabama
alaska
thanks
to
geographic
and
climatic
conditions
the
alaskan
game
laws
and
with
which
to
enforce
them
the
status
of
the
wild
life
of
alaska
is
fairly
satisfactory
i
think
that
at
present
no
species
is
in
danger
of
extinction
in
the
near
future
when
it
was
pointed
out
to
congress
in
by
madison
grant
palmer
and
others
that
the
wild
life
of
alaska
was
seriously
threatened
congress
immediately
enacted
the
law
that
was
recommended
and
now
appropriates
yearly
a
fair
sum
for
its
enforcement
i
regard
the
alaskan
situation
as
being
for
so
vast
and
difficult
a
region
reasonably
well
in
hand
even
though
open
to
improvement
there
is
one
fatal
defect
in
our
alaskan
game
law
in
the
perpetual
and
sweeping
license
to
kill
that
is
bestowed
upon
natives
and
prospectors
under
cover
of
this
law
the
indians
can
slaughter
game
to
any
extent
they
choose
and
they
are
great
killers
for
example
in
at
sand
point
kenai
peninsula
frank
kleinchmidt
saw
caribou
tongues
in
the
boat
of
a
native
that
had
been
brought
in
for
sale
at
cents
while
the
carcasses
were
left
where
they
fell
to
poison
the
air
of
alaska
thanks
to
the
game
law
and
five
wardens
the
number
of
big
game
animals
killed
last
year
in
alaska
by
sportsmen
was
reasonably
small
just
as
it
should
have

the

many

the

the

as
a
general
proposition
i
think
i
can
say
that
all

are
becoming
scarcer
in

as
we
have

that
do
not

no

the

the

in
order
to
cure

disease
the
surgeon
must
make
of
it
a

diagnosis
it
is
useless
to
try
to
prescribe
remedies
without
a
thorough
understanding
of
the
trouble
that
the
best
and
most
interesting
wild
life
of
america
is
disappearing
at
a
rapid
rate
we
all
know
only
too
well
that
proposition
is
entirely
beyond
the
domain
of
argument
the
fact
that
a
species
or
a
group
of
species
has
made
a
little
gain
here
and
there
or
is
stationary
does
not
sensibly
diminish
the
force
of
the
descending
blow
the
situation
is
full
of
surprises

example
in
i
was
astounded
by
the
extent
to
which
bird
life
had
decreased
over
the
miles
between

and

missouri
river
since
for
there
was
no
reason
to
expect
anything
of
the
kind
even
the
jack
rabbits
and
coyotes
had
almost
totally
disappeared
the
duties
of
the
present
hour
that
fairly
thrust
themselves
into
our
faces
and
will
not
be
put
aside
are
these
to
save
valuable
species
from
extermination
to
preserve
a
satisfactory
representation
of
our
once
rich
fauna
to
hand
down
to
posterity
to
protect
the
farmer
and
fruit
grower
from
the
enormous
losses
that
the
destruction
of
our
insectivorous
and
birds
is
now
inflicting
upon
both
the
producer
and
consumer
to
protect
our
forests
by
protecting
the
birds
that
keep
down
the
myriads
of
insects
that
are
destructive
to
trees
and
shrubs
to
preserve
to
the
future
sportsmen
of
america
enough
game
and
fish
that
they
may
have
at
least
a
taste
of
the
legitimate
pursuit
of
game
in
the
open
that
has
made
life
so
interesting
to
the
sportsmen
of
for
any
civilized
nation
to
exterminate
valuable
and
interesting
species
of
wild
mammals
birds
or
fishes
is
more
than
a
disgrace
it
is
a
crime
we
have
no
right
legal
moral
or
commercial
to
exterminate
any
valuable
or
interesting
species
because
none
of
them
belong
to
us
to
exterminate
or
not
as
we
please
for
the
people
of
any
civilized
nation
to
permit
the
slaughter
of
the
wild
birds
that
protect
its
crops
its
fruits
and
its
forests
from
the
insect
hordes
is
worse
than
folly
it
is
sheer
orneryness
and
idiocy
people
who
are
either
so
lazy
or
asinine
as
to
permit
the
slaughter
of
their
best
friends
deserve
to
have
their
crops
destroyed
and
their
forests
ravaged
they
deserve
to
pay
twenty
cents
a
pound
for
their
cotton
when
the
boll
weevil
has
cut
down
the
normal
supply
it
is
very
desirable
that
we
should
now
take
an
inventory
of
the
forces
that
have
been
and
are
active
in
the
destruction
of
our
wild
birds
mammals
and
game
fishes
during
the
past
ten
years
a
sufficient
quantity
of
facts
and
figures
has
become
available
to
enable
us
to
secure
a
reasonably
full
and
accurate
view
of
the
whole
situation
as
we
pause
on
our
and
survey
the
field
of
carnage
we
find
that
we
are
reviewing
the
of
it
is
indeed
a
motley
array
we
see
true
sportsmen
beside
ordinary
gunners
and
meat
hunters
handsome
setter
dogs
are
mixed
up
with
coyotes
cats
foxes
and
skunks
and
women
and
maids
are
jostled
by
and
plume
hunters
verily
the
destruction
of
wild
life
makes
strange
companions
let
us
briefly
review
the
several
army
corps
that
together
make
up
the
army
of
the
destroyers
space
in
this
volume
forbids
an
extended
notice
of
each
unfortunately
it
is
impossible
to
segregate
some
of
these
classes
and
number
each
one
for
they
merge
together
too
closely
for
that
but
we
can
at
least
describe
the
several
classes
that
form
the
great
mass
of
destroyers
the
gentlemen
these
men
are
the
very
bone
and
sinew
of
wild
life
preservation
these
are
the
men
who
have
red
blood
in
their
veins
who
annually
hear
the
red
gods
calling
who
love
the
earth
the
mountains
the
woods
the
waters
and
the
sky
these
are
the
men
to
whom
the
bag
is
a
matter
of
small
importance
and
to
whom
the
has
only
academic
interest
because
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
they
do
not
care
to
kill
all
that
the
law
allows
the
tenth
and
exceptional
time
is
when
the
bag
limit
is
one
a
gentleman
sportsman
is
a
man
who
protects
game
stops
shooting
when
he
has
enough
without
reference
to
the
legal
and
whenever
a
species
is
threatened
with
extinction
he
conscientiously
refrains
from
shooting
it
the
true
sportsmen
of
the
world
are
the
men
who
once
were
keen
in
the
stubble
or
on
the
trail
but
who
have
been
halted
by
the
general
slaughter
and
the
awful
decrease
of
game
many
of
them
long
before
a
hair
has
turned
gray
have
hung
up
their
guns
forever
and
turned
to
the
camera
these
are
the
men
who
are
willing
to
hand
out
checks
or
to
leave
their
mirth
and
their
employment
and
go
to
the
firing
line
at
their
state
capitols
to
lock
horns
with
the
killers
of
wild
life
who
recognize
no
check
or
limit
save
the
law
these
are
the
men
who
have
done
the
most
to
put
upon
our
statute
books
the
laws
that
thus
far
have
saved
some
of
our
american
game
from
total
annihilation
and
who
so
we
firmly
believe
will
be
chiefly
instrumental
in
tightening
the
lines
of
protection
around
the
remnant
these
are
the
men
who
are
making
and
stocking

and

of

and

you

that
i
would
like
to
name
were
space
available
but
to
set
down
here
a
complete
list
is
quite
impossible
the
best
and
the
most
of
the
laws
now
in
force
in
the
united
states
and
canada
were
brought
into
existence
through
the
initiative
and
efforts
of
the
real
sportsmen
of
those
two
nations
but
for
their
activity
exerted
on
the
right
side
the
settled
portion
of
north
america
would
be
an
utterly
gameless
land
even
though
the
sportsmen
have
taken
their
toll
of
the
wilds
they
have
made
the
laws
that
have
saved
a
remnant
of
the
game
until
for
all
that
however
every
man
who
still
shoots
game
is
a
soldier
in
the
army
of
destruction
there
is
no
blinking
that
fact
such
men
do
not
stand
on
the
summit
with
the
men
who
now
protect
the
game
do
not
shoot
at
all
the
millions
of
men
who
do
not
shoot
and
who
also
nothing
to
protect
or
preserve
wild
do
not
count
in
this
warfare
they
are
merely
ciphers
in
front
of
the
real
figures
the

who

out
of

enormous
mass
of

who

up

against
the

i
believe
that
only
one
out
of
every
stops
shooting
when

becomes
scarce
and
extinction
is
impending
all
of
the
others
feel
that
it
is
right
and
proper
to
kill
all
the
game
that
they
can
kill
to
the
legal
bag
it
is
the
reasoning
of
shylock
justice
demands
it
and
doth
give
it
especially
is
this
true
of
the
men
who
pay
their
per
year
for
a
resident
hunting
license
and
feel
that
in
doing
so
they
have
done
a
great
big
thing
this
is
a
very
deadly
frame
of
mind
ethically
it
is
and
at
least
two
million
men
and
boys
who
shoot
american
game
must
be
shown
that
it
is
wrong
this
is
the
spirit
of
extermination
clothed
in
the
robes
of
law
and
justice
whenever
and
wherever
game
birds
are
so
scarce
that
a
good
shot
who
hunts
hard
during
a
day
in
the
fields
finds
only
three
or
four
birds
he
should
shooting
at
once
and
devote
his
mind
and
energies
to
the
problem
of
bringing
back
the
game
it
is
strange
that
conditions
do
not
make
this
duty
clear
to
every
conscientious
citizen
the
shylock
spirit
which
prompts
a
man
to
kill
all
that
the
law
allows
is
a
terrible
scourge
to
the
wild
life
of
america
and
to
the
world
at
large
it
is
the
spirit
of
extermination
according
to
law
even
the
killing
of
game
for
the
market
is
not
so
great
a
scourge
as
this
for
this
spirit
searches
out
the
game
in
every
nook
and
cranny
of
the
world
and
spares
not
in
effect
it
says
if
the
law
is
defective
it
is
right
for
me
to
take
every
advantage
of
it
i
do
not
need
to
have
any
conscience
in
the
matter
outside
letter
of
the
the
extent
to
which
this
amazing
spirit
prevails
is
positively
awful
you
will
find
it
among
pseudo
to
a
paralyzing
extent
it
is
the
great
gunner
paradox
and
it
pervades
this
country
from
corner
to
corner
no
there
is
no
use
in
trying
to
educate
the
mass
of
the
hunters
of
america
out
of
it
as
a
means
of
saving
the
game
for
positively
it
can
not
be
done
do
not
waste
time
in
trying
it
if
you
rely
upon
it
you
will
be
doing
a
great
wrong
to
wild
life
and
promoting
extermination
the
only
remedy
is
laws
for
long
close
seasons
for
a
great
many
forget
the
paltry
license
money
the
license
fees
never
represent
more
than
a
tenth
part
of
the
value
of
the
game
that
is
killed
under
licenses
the
savage
desire
to
kill
all
that
the
law
allows
often
is
manifested
in
men
in
whom
we
naturally
expect
to
find
a
very
different
spirit
by
way
of
illumination
i
offer
three
cases
out
of
the
many
that
i
could
state
case
no
duck
a
gentleman
of
my
acquaintance
has
spent
several
years
and
much
money
in
breeding
wild
ducks
from
my
relations
with
him
i
had
acquired
the
belief
that
he
was
a
great
lover
of
ducks
and
at
least
wished
all
species
well
one
whizzing
cold
day
in
winter
he
called
upon
me
and
stated
that
he
had
been
which
surprised
me
he
added
i
have
just
spent
two
days
on
great
south
bay
and
i
made
a
great
killing
the
two
days
i
got
ducks
i
said
how
you
do
it
caring
for
wild
ducks
as
you
do
well
i
had
hunted
ducks
twice
before
on
great
south
bay
and
have
very
good
luck
but
this
time
the
cold
weather
drove
the
ducks
in
and
i
got
square
with
them
case
no
a
short
time
ago
the
news
was
published
in
and
that
a
ornithologist
had
distinguished
himself
in
one
of
the
states
by
the
skill
he
had
displayed
in
bagging
ducks
in
one
day
greatly
to
the
envy
of
the
natives
and
if
this
shoe
fits
any
american
naturalist
he
is
welcome
to
put
it
on
and
wear
it
case
no
a
friend
of
mine
in
the
south
is
the
owner
of
a
game
preserve
in
which
wild
ducks
are
at
times
very
numerous
once
upon
a
time
he
was
visited
by
a
northern
sportsmen
who
takes
a
deep
and
abiding
interest
in
the
preservation
of
game
the
sportsman
was
invited
to
go
out
ducks
being
then
in
season
there
he
said
yes
i
will
go
and
i
want
you
to
put
me
in
a
place
where
i
can
kill
a
ducks
in
a
i
never
have
done
that
yet
and
i
would
like
to
do
it
once
all
right
said
my
friend
i
can
put
you
in
such
a
place
and
if
you
can
shoot
well
enough
you
can
kill
a
hundred
ducks
in
a
day
the
effort
was
made
in
all
earnestness
there
was
much
shooting
but
few
were
the
ducks
that
fell
before
it
in
concluding
this
story
my
friend
remarked
in
a
tone
of
disgust
all
the
sportsmen
that
come
to
me
are
just
like
that
want
to
kill
all
they
can
there
is
a
by
which
to
separate
the
conscientious
sportsmen
from
the
mere
gunners
here
it
is
a
stops
shooting
when
game
becomes
scarce
and
he
does
not
object
to
laws
but
a
believes
in
killing
all
that
the
law
allows
and
objects
to
long
close
i
warrant
that
whenever
and
wherever
this
test
is
applied
it
will
separate
the
sheep
from
the
goats
it
applies
in
all
america
all
asia
and
africa
and
in
greenland
with
equal
force

shields
a
notable
defender
of
wild
life
the
this
term
was
coined
by
shields
in
when
he
was
editor
and
owner
of
and
it
has
come
into
general
use
it
has
been
recognized
by
a
judge
on
the
bench
as
being
an
appropriate
term
to
apply
to
all
men
who
selfishly
slaughter
wild
game
beyond
the
limits
of
decency
although
it
is
a
harsh
term
and
was
mercilessly
used
by
shields
in
his
fierce
war
on
the
men
who
slaughtered
game
for
sport
it
has
jarred
at
least
a
hundred
thousand
men
into
their
first
realization
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
difference
between
decency
and
indecency
in
the
pursuit
of
game
the
use
of
the
term
has
done
great
but
strange
to
say
it
has
made
for
shields
a
great
many
enemies
the
ranks
of
the
themselves
from
this
one
might
fairly
suppose
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as

sympathetic
one
thing
at

is
certain
during
a
period
of
about
six
years
while
his
war
with
the
was
on
from
maine
to
california
shields
name
became
a
genuine
terror
to
excessive
killers
of
game
and
it
is
reasonably
certain
that
his
war
saved
a
great
number
of
game
birds
from
the
slaughter
that
otherwise
would
have
overtaken
them
the
number

the
guerrillas
of

we
have
now
to
deal
with
the
guerrillas
of
destruction
in
warfare
a
or
is
an
armed
man
who
recognizes
none
of
the
rules
of
civilized
warfare
and
very
often
has
no
commander
in
france
he
is
called
a
or
the
guerrilla
goes
out
to
live
on
the
country
to
skulk
to
war
on
the
weak
and
never
attack
save
from
ambush
or
when
the
odds
clearly
are
on
his
side
his
military
status
is
barely
one
remove
from
that
of
the
spy
the
who
harry
the
game
and
other
wild
life
in
order
to
use
it
as
a
staple
food

the
italians
negroes
and
others
who
shoot
as
food
the
and
the
hunters
all
over
the
world
are
the
guerrillas
of
the
army
of
destruction
let
us
consider
some
of
these
grand
divisions
in
detail
here
is
an
inexorable
law
of
nature
to
which
there
are
no
exceptions
wild
species
of
bird
mammal
reptile
or
fish
can
withstand
exploitation
for
commercial
the
men
who
pursue
wild
creatures
for
the
money
or
other
value
there
is
in
them
never
give
up
they
work
at
slaughter
when
other
men
are
enjoying
life
or
are
asleep
if
they
are
persistent
no
species
on
which
they
fix
the
evil
eye
escapes
extermination
at
their
hands
does
anyone
question
this
statement
if
so
let
him
turn
backward
and
look
at
the
lists
of
dead
and
dying
species
the
division
of
contains
all
men
who
sordidly
shoot
for
the
to
save
bacon
and
beef
at
the
expense
of
the
public
or
for
the
markets
there
are
a
few
wilderness
regions
so
remote
and
so
difficult
of
access
that
the
transportation
of
meat
into
them
is
a
matter
of
much
difficulty
and
expense
there
are
a
very
few
men
in
north
america
who
are
justified
in
living
off
the
country
short
the
genuine
prospectors
always
have
been
counted
in
this
class
but
all
miners
who
are
fully
located
all
lumbermen
and
certainly
are
not
in
the
prospector
class
they
are
abundantly
able
to
maintain
continuous
lines

the

sage
has
now
converted
it
into
a
bird
sanctuary
the
output
of
this
systematic
bird
slaughter
has
supplied
the
greedy
game
markets
of
boston
new
york
philadelphia
washington
baltimore
chicago
new
orleans
louis
salt
lake
city
san
francisco
portland
and
seattle
the
history
of
this
industry
its
methods
its
carnage
its
profits
and
its
losses
would
make
a
volume
but
we
can
not
enter
upon
it
here
beyond
reasonable
doubt
this
awful
traffic
in
dead
game
is
responsible
for
at
least
of
the
slaughter
that
has
reduced
our
game
birds
to
a
mere
remnant
of
their
former
abundance
there
is
no
influence
so
deadly
to
wild
life
as
that
of
the
market
gunner
who
works
six
days
a
week
from
sunrise
until
sunset
hunting
down
and
killing
every
game
bird
that
he
can
reach
with
a
gun
during
the
past
five
years
several
of
the
killing
grounds
have
been
so
thoroughly
shot
out
that
they
have
ceased
to
hold
their
former
rank
this
is
the
case
with
the
minnesota
lakes
the
sunk
lands
of
arkansas
the
klamath
lakes
of
oregon
and
i
think
it
is
also
true
of
southern
california
the
klamath
lakes
have
been
taken
over
by
the
government
as
a
bird
refuge
currituck
sound
at
the
northeastern
corner
of
north
carolina
has
been
so
bottled
up
by
the
bayne
law
of
new
york
state
that
currituck
greatest
market
has
been
cut
off
last
year
only
the
usual
number
of
ducks
and
geese
were
killed
and
already
many
professional
duck
and
brant
shooters
have
abandoned
the
business
because
the
commission
merchants
no
longer
will
buy
dead
birds
illustration
ruffed
grouse
a
common
victim
of
illegal
slaughter
very
many
enormous
bags
of
game
have
been
made
in
a
day
by
market
gunners
but
rarely
have
they
published
any
of
their
records
the
greatest
kill
of
which
i
ever
have
heard
occurred
under
the
auspices
of
the
glenn
county
club
in
southern
california
on
february
two
men
armed
with
automatic
fired
five
shots
apiece
and
got
ten
geese
out
of
one
flock
in
one
hour
they
killed
hundred
and
eighteen
and
their
bag
for
the
day
was
hundred
and
fifty
geese
the
shooter
who
wrote
the
story
for
publication
on
february
at
willows
glenn
county
california
said
it
being
warm
weather
the
birds
had
to
be
shipped
at
once
in
order
to
keep
them
from
spoiling
a
photograph
was
made
of
the
one
hour
slaughter
of
two
hundred
and
eighteen
geese
and
it
was
published
in
a
western
magazine
with
story
nearly
all
of
which
will
be
found
in
chapter
xv
the
reasons
why
market
shooting
is
so
deadly
destructive
to
wild
life
are
not
obscure
the
true
sportsman
hunts
during
a
very
few
days
only
each
year
the
market
gunners
shoot
early
and
late
six
days
a
week
month
after
month
when
game
is
abundant
the
price
is
low
and
a
great
quantity
must
be
killed
in
order
to
make
it
pay
well
when
game
is
scarce
the
market
prices
are
high
and
the
shooter
makes
the
utmost
exertions
to
find
the
last
of
the
game
in
order
to
secure
the
big
money
when
game
is
protected
by
law
thousands
of
people
with
money
desire
it
for
their
tables
just
the
same
and
are
willing
to
pay
fabulous
prices
for
what
they
want
when
they
want
it
many
a
dealer
is
quite
willing
to
run
the
risk
of
fines
because
fines
do
really
hurt
they
are
only
annoying
the
dealer
wishes
to
make
the
big
profit
and
his
and
besides
he
reasons
if
i
do
supply
him
some
one
else
will
so
what
is
the
difference
when
game
is
scarce
prices
high
and
the
consumer
money
ready
there
are
a
hundred
tricks
to
which
shooters
and
dealers
willingly
resort
to
ship
and
receive
unlawful
game
without
detection
it
takes
the
very
best
kind
of
game
wardens
genuine
detectives
in
fact
to
ferret
out
these
cunning
illegal
practices
and
catch
lawbreakers
with
the
goods
on
them
so
that
they
can
be
punished
mind
you
convictions
can
not
be
secured
at
ends
of
the
line
save
by
the
most
extraordinary
good
fortune
and
usually
the
shooter
and
shipper
escape
even
when
the
dealer
is
apprehended
and
fined
illustration
a
perfectly
lawful
bag
of
ruffed
grouse
for
two
men
from
rod
and
gun
in
canada
here
are
some
of
the
methods
that
have
been
practiced
in
the
past
in
getting
illegal
game
into
the
new
york
market
ruffed
grouse
and
quail
have
both
been
shipped
in
butter
firkins
marked
butter
and
latterly
butter
has
actually
been
packed
solidly
on
top
of
the
birds
ruffed
grouse
and
quail
very
often
have
been
shipped
in
egg
crates
marked
eggs
they
have
been
shipped
in
trunks
and
suit
cases
a
very
common
method
for
illegal
game
birds
all
over
the
united
states
in
oklahoma
when
a
man
refuses
to
open
his
trunk
for
a
game
warden
the
warden
joyously
gets
out
his
brace
and
bitt
and
bores
an
inch
hole
into
the
lower
story
of
the
trunk
if
dead
birds
are
there
the
auger
quickly
reveals
them
three
years
ago
i
was
told
that
certain
on
long
island
made
daily
collections
of
dead
ducks
intended
for
the
new
york
market
and
the
drivers
kindly
shipped
them
by
express
from
the
end
of
the
route
once
upon
a
time
a
new
york
man
gave
notice
that
on
a
certain
date
he
would
be
in
a
certain
town
in
lawrence
county
new
york
with
a
palace
to
buy
horses
car
and
man
appeared
there
as
advertised
very
ostentatiously
he
bought
one
horse
and
had
it
taken
aboard
the
car
before
the
gaze
of
the
admiring
populace
at
night
when
the
had
gone
to
bed
many
men
appeared
and
into
the
horseless
end
of
that
car
they
loaded
thousands
of
ruffed
grouse
the
game
warden
who
described
the
incident
to
me
said
that
man
pulled
out
for
new
york
with
one
horse
and
a
car
load
of
ruffed
whenever
a
good
market
exists
for
the
sale
of
game
as
sure
as
the
world
that
market
will
be
supplied
states
forbid
by
law
the
sale
of
protected
game
but
twenty
of
them
do
expressly
prohibit
the
sale
of
game
stolen
from
neighboring
states
that
is
very
very
weak
point
in
the
laws
of
all
those
a
child
can
see
how
it
works
take
pittsburgh
as
a
case
in
point
in
the
winter
and
spring
of
the
state
game
commission
of
pennsylvania
found
that
quail
and
ruffed
grouse
were
being
sold
in
pittsburgh
in
large
quantities
the
state
laws
were
well
enforced
and
it
was
believed
that
the
birds
were
not
being
killed
in
pennsylvania
some
other
state
was
being
the
game
commission
went
to
work
and
in
a
very
short
time
certain
of
pittsburgh
were
arrested
at
first
they
tried
to
bluff
their
way
out
of
their
difficulty
and
even
went
as
far
as
to
bring
charges
against
the
whom
the
commission
had
instructed
to
buy
some
of
their
illegal
game
and
pay
for
it
but
the
net
of
the
law
tightened
upon
them
so
quickly
and
so
tightly
that
they
threw
up
their
hands
and
begged
for
mercy
it
was
found
that
those
pittsburgh
were
selling
quail
and
grouse
that
had
been
stolen
in
thousands
from
the
state
of
kentucky
between
the
state
game
laws
working
in
lovely
harmony
with
the
lacey
federal
law
that
prohibits
the
shipment
of
game
illegally
killed
or
sold
the
whole
bad
business
was
laid
bare
and
signed
confessions
were
promptly
obtained
from
the
shippers
in
kentucky
at
that
very
time
a
good
bill
for
the
better
protection
of
her
game
was
before
the
kentucky
legislature
and
a
certain
member
was
vigorously
opposing
it
as
he
had
successfully
done
in
previous
years
he
was
told
that
the
state
was
being
robbed
but
refused
to
believe
it
then
a
signed
confession
was
laid
before
him
bearing
the
name
of
the
man
who
was
instigating
his
opposition
his
friend
who
confessed
that
he
had
illegally
bought
and
shipped
to
pittsburgh
over
birds
the
objector
literally
threw
up
his
hands
and
said
i
have
been
let
the
bill
go
through
and
it
went
illustration
snow

a
great
game
bird
of
these
were
found
in
in
one
new
york
warehouse
before
the
passage
of
the
bayne
law
new
york
city
was
a
fence
for
the
sale
of
grouse
illegally
killed
in
massachusetts
connecticut
pennsylvania
new
jersey
and
i
know
not
how
many
other
states
the
bayne
law
stopped
all
that
business
abruptly
and
forever
and
if
the
ruffed
grouse
quail
and
ducks
of
the
eastern
states
are
offered
for
sale
in
chicago
cincinnati
baltimore
and
washington
the
people
of
new
york
and
massachusetts
can
at
least
be
assured
that
they
are
not
to
blame
those
two
states
now
maintain
no
fences
for
the
sale
of
game
that
has
been
stolen
from
other
states
they
have
both
set
their
houses
in
order
and
set
two
examples
for
forty
other
states
to
follow
the
remedy
for
all
this
miserable
business
is
simple
and
easily
obtained
let
each
state
of
the
united
states
and
each
province
and
canada
a
bayne
law
absolutely
prohibiting
the
sale
of
all
wild
native
and
the
thing
is
done
but
nothing
short
of
that
will
be
really
effective
it
will
not
do
at
all
to
let
state
laws
rest
with
merely
forbidding
the
sale
of
game
protected
by
the
state
for
that
law
is
full
of
it
does
much
good
service
yes
but
what
earthly
can
there
be
in
any
state
to
the
enactment
of
a
law
that
is
sweepingly
effective
and
which
can
not
be
evaded
save
through
the
criminal
connivance
of
officers
of
the
law
by
way
of
illustration
to
show
what
the
sale
of
wild
game
means
to
the
remnant
of
our
game
and
the
wicked
slaughter
of
birds
to
which
it
leads
consider
these
figures
dead
birds
found
in
one
cold
storage
house
in
new
york
in
snow
buntings
grouse
sandpipers
quail
plover
ducks

bobolinks
woodcock
the
fines
for
this
lot
if
imposed
would
have
amounted
to
shortly
after
that
seizure
american
quail
became
so
scarce
that
in
effect
they
totally
disappeared
from
the
banquet
tables
of
new
york
i
can
not
recall
having
been
served
with
one
since
but
the
little
egyptian
quail
can
be
legally
imported
and
sold
when
officially
tagged
few
persons
away
from
the
firing
line
realize
the
effects
of
the
sale
of
wild
game
here
are
a
few
flashes
from
the
searchlight
at
hangkow
china
william
beebe
found
that
during
his
visit
in
over
pheasants
of
various
species
were
shipped
from
that
port
on
one
steamer
to
the
london
market
and
this
when
english
pheasants
were
selling
in
the
covent
garden
market
at
from
two
to
three
shillings
each
for
birds
in
ptarmigan
from
norway
bound
for
the
chicago
market
passed
through
the
port
of
new
york
not
by
any
means
the
first
or
the
last
shipment
of
the
kind
the
epicures
of
chicago
are
being
permitted
to
comb
the
game
out
of
norway
in
egyptian
quail
were
shipped
to
europe
from
alexandria
egypt
just
why
that
species
has
not
already
been
exterminated
is
a
zoological
mystery
but
extermination
surely
will
come
some
day
and
i
think
it
will
be
in
the
near
future
the
coast
of
china
has
been
raked
and
scraped
for
wild
ducks
to
ship
to
new
york
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
bayne
law
i
have
forgotten
the
figures
that
once
were
given
me
but
they
were
an
astonishing
number
of
thousands
for
the
year
the
division
of
negroes
and
poor
whites
who
kill
song
and
other
birds
indiscriminately
will
be
found
in
a
separate
chapter
the
division
of
resident
this
refers
to
the
men
who
live
in
the
haunts
of
big
game
where
wardens
are
the
most
of
the
time
totally
absent
and
where
bucks
does
and
fawns
of
hoofed
big
game
may
be
killed
in
season
and
out
of
season
with
impunity
it
includes
guides
ranchmen
cowboys
miners
lumbermen
and
floaters
generally
in
times
past
certain
taxidermists
of
montana
promoted
the
slaughter
of
wild
bison
in
the
yellowstone
park
and
it
was
a
pair
of
rascally
taxidermists
who
killed
or
caused
to
be
killed
in
lost
park
in
the
very
last
bison
of
colorado
it
seems
to
be
natural
for
the
minds
of
men
who
live
in
america
in
the
haunts
of
big
game
to
drift
into
the
idea
that
the
wild
game
around
them
is
all
theirs
very
few
of
them
recognize
the
fact
that
every
other
man
woman
and
child
in
a
given
state
or
province
has
vested
rights
in
its
wild
game
it
is
natural
for
a
frontiersman
to
feel
that
because
he
is
in
the
wilds
he
has
a
right
to
live
off
the
country
but
idea
is
totally
if
some
way
can
not
be
found
to
curb
that
propensity
among
our
frontiersmen
then
we
may
as
well
bid
all
our
big
game
a
long
farewell
for
the
deadly
residents
surely
will
exterminate
it
outside
the
game
preserves
the
residents
are
in
my
opinion
about
ten
times
more
destructive
than
the
sportsmen
a
sportsman
in
quest
of
large
game
is
in
the
field
only
from
ten
to
thirty
days
all
his
movements
are
known
and
all
his
trophies
are
seen
and
counted
his
killing
is
limited
by
law
and
upon
him
the
law
is
actually
enforced
often
a
resident
hunts
the
whole
twelve
months
of
the
year
for
food
for
amusement
and
for
trophies
to
sell
rarely
does
a
game
warden
reach
his
cabin
because
the
wardens
are
few
the
distances
great
and
the
frontier
cabins
are
widely
scattered
carl
pickhardt
told
me
of
a
guide
in
newfoundland
who
had
a
shed
in
the
woods
hanging
full
of
bodies
of
caribou
and
who
admitted
to
him
that
while
the
law
allowed
him
five
caribou
each
year
he
killed
each
year
about
phillips
knows
of
a
mountain
in
british
columbia
once
well
stocked
with
goats
on
which
the
goats
have
been
completely
exterminated
by
one
man
who
lives
within
easy
striking
distance
of
them
and
who
finds
goat
meat
to
his
liking
i
have
been
reliably
informed
that
in
at
haha
lake
near
grande
bay
saguenay
district
one
family
of
six
persons
killed
woodland
caribou
and
six
moose
this
meant
the
waste
of
about
pounds
of
good
meat
and
the
death
of
several
female
animals
in
i
knew
a
man
named
owens
who
lived
on
the
head
of
sunday
creek
montana
who
told
me
that
in
he
killed
mule
deer
for
himself
and
family
the
family
ate
as
much
as
possible
the
dogs
ate
all
they
could
and
in
the
spring
the
remainder
spoiled
now
there
is
not
a
deer
an
antelope
or
a
sage
grouse
within
fifty
miles
of
that
lifeless
waste
here
is
a
montana

lesson
on
the
frame
of
mind
of
the
resident
hunter
copied
from
magazine

it
is
from
a
letter
to
the
editor
written
by
davis
november
and
will
remain
a
red
letter
day
with
a
half
thousand
men
for
years
to
come
these
half
thousand
men
gathered
along
the
border
of
the
yellowstone
national
park
near
gardiner
montana
at
a
point
known
as
buffalo
flats
to
exterminate
elk
the
snow
had
driven
the
elk
down
to
the
foothills
and
buffalo
flats
is
on
the
border
of
the
park
and
outside
the
park
the
elk
entered
this
little
valley
for
food
like
hungry
wolves
shooters
not
hunters
gathered
along
the
border
waiting
to
catch
an
elk
off
the
reservation
and
kill
it
on
november
about
elk
crossed
the
line
and
the
slaughter
began
i
have
not
the
data
of
the
number
killed
this
day
but
it
was
hundreds
on
the
stepped
over
and
were
promptly
executed
like

not
one
escaped
on
the
evening
of
the
were

just
over

line
and
the
army
of
brave
men
entrenched
themselves
for

battle
which
was
expected
to
open
next
morning
before
daylight
of

began
the

were
over
the
line
feeding
on
buffalo
flats
one
hundred
and
men
poured
bullets
into
this
band
of
elk
till
the
ground
was
red
with
blood
and
strewn
with
carcasses
and
in
their
madness
they
shot
each
other
one
man
was
shot
through
the
ear
a
close
call
another
received
a
bullet
through
his
coat
sleeve
and
another
was
shot
through
the
bowels
and
ca
live
my
informer
told
me
he
participated
in
the
slaughter
and
while
he
would
not
take
fifty
dollars
for
what
he
saw
and
the
experience
he
went
through
yet
he
would
not
go
through
it
again
for
when
my
informer
got
back
to
gardiner
that
day
there
were
four
sleigh
loads
of
elk
each
load
containing
from
twenty
to
elk
besides
mules
and
horses
carrying
one
to
two
each
this
was
only
a
part
of
the
slaughter
hundreds
more
were
carried
to
other
points
and
this
was
only
one
day
work
hundreds
of
wounded
elk
wandered
back
into
the
park
to
die
and
others
died
outside
the
park
the
station
at
livingston
montana
for
a
week
looked
like
a
packing
house
carcasses
were
piled
up
on
the
trucks
and
depot
platform
the
baggage
cars
were
loaded
with
elk
going
to
points
east
and
west
of
livingston
maybe
this
is
all
right
maybe
the
government
ca
stop
the
elk
from
crossing
the
line
maybe
the
elk
were
helped
over
but
it
strikes
me
there
is
something
wrong
somewhere
the
division
of
hired
the
scourge
of
in
territory
the
mining
camps
and
the
is
a
long
story
and
if
told
in
detail
it
would
make
several
chapters
their
awful
destructiveness
is
well
known
it
is
a
common
thing
for
the
boss
to
hire
a
hunter
to
kill
big
game
to
supply
the
hungry
outfit
and
save
beef
and
pork
the
abuses
arising
from
this
source
easily
could
be
checked
and
finally
suppressed
a
law
would
do
the
business
forbidding
any
person
employed
in
any
camp
of
sheep
men
cattle
men
lumbermen
miners
railway
laborers
or
excavators
to
own
or
use
a
rifle
in
hunting

and
forbidding
any
employer
of
labor
to
feed
those
laborers
or
permit
them
to
be
fed
on
the
flesh
of
wild
game
mammals
or

are

they

a

case
in
the
state
of
colorado
sincerely
desires
to
protect
and
perpetuate
its
slender
remnant
of
mountain
sheep
but
as
usual
the
lawless
miscreant
is
abroad
to
thwart
the
efforts
of
the
guardians
of
the
game
every
state
that
strives
to
protect
its
big
game
has
such
doings
as
this
to
contend
with
in
the
winter
of
a
resident
poacher
brought
into
grant
colorado
a
lot
of
mountain
sheep
meat
and
he
actually
sold
it
to
residents
of
that
town
the
price
was
cents
per
a
lot
of
it
was
purchased
by
the

i
have
no
doubt
that
the
same
man
who
did
that
job
which
was
made
possible
only
by
the
of
the
citizens
of
grant
will
try
the
same
game
next
winter
unless
the
state
game
commissioner
is
able
to
bring
him
to
book
a
wyoming
case
in
as
a
fair
sample
of
what
game
wardens
and
the
general
public
are
sometimes
compelled
to
endure
through
the
improper
decisions
of
judges
i
will
cite
this
case
in
the
shoshone
mountains
of
northern
wyoming
about
fifty
miles
or
so
from
the
town
of
cody
in
the
winter
of
a
man
was
engaged
in
trapping
coyotes
it
was
currently
reported
that
he
had
been
driven
out
of
montana
and
idaho
he
had
scores
of
traps
he
baited
his
traps
with
the
flesh
of
deer
elk
calves
and
grouse
all
illegally
killed
and
illegally
used
for
that
purpose
a
man
of
my
acquaintance
saw
some
of
this
game
meat
actually
used
as
described
the
man
was
a
notorious
character
and
cruel
in
the
extreme
finally
a
game
warden
caught
him
arrested
him
and
took
him
to
cody
for
trial
it
happened
that
the
judge
on
the
bench
had
once
trapped
with
him
and
therefore
he
set
the
free
while
the
was
roasted
that
once
took
into
the
mountains
a
horse
to
kill
and
use
as
the
animal
was
blind
in
one
eye
and
because
it
would
not
graze
precisely
where
the
wolfer
desired
it
to
remain
he
deliberately
destroyed
the
sight
of
its
good
eye
and
left
it
for
days
without
the
ability
to
find
water
think
of
the
fate
of
any
wild
animal
that
unkind
fate
places
at
the
mercy
of

unseen
foes
of

quite
unintentionally
on
his
part
man
the
arch
destroyer
and
the
most
predatory
and
merciless
of
all
animal
species
except
the
wolves
has
rendered
a
great
service
to
all
the
birds
that
live
or
nest
upon
the
ground
his
relentless
pursuit
and
destruction
of
the
animals
is
in
part
the
salvation
of
the
ground
birds
of
and
yesterday
if
the
teeth
and
claws
had
been
permitted
to
multiply
unchecked
down
to
the
present
time
with
man
warfare
on
the
upland
game
proceeding
as
it
has
done
scores
upon
scores
of
species
long
ere
this
would
have
been
exterminated
but
the
slaughter
of
the
millions
of
north
american
foxes
wolves
weasels
skunks
and
mink
has
so
overwhelmingly
reduced
the
enemies
of
the
birds
that
the
balance
of
wild
nature
has
been
preserved
as
a
rule
the
few
predatory
wild
animals
that
remain
are
not
slaughtering
the
birds
to
a
serious
extent
and
for
this
we
may
well
be
thankful
the
domestic
in
such
thickly
settled
communities
as
our
northern
states
from
the
atlantic
coast
to
the
sandhills
of
kansas
and
nebraska
the
domestic
cat
is
probably
the
greatest
scourge
of
bird
life
thousands
of
persons
who
never
have
seen
a
hunting
cat
in
action
will
doubt
this
statement
but
the
proof
of
its
truthfulness
is
only
too
painfully
abundant
unhappily
it
is
the
way
of
the
hunting
cat
to
stalk
unseen
and
to
kill
the
very
birds
that
are
most
friendly
with
man
and
most
helpful
to
him
in
his
farming
and
business
the
quail
is
about
the
only
game
bird
that
the
cat
affects
seriously
and
to
it
the
cat
is
very
destructive
it
is
the
robin
catbird
thrush
bluebird
dove
woodpecker
chickadee
phoebe
tanager
and
other
birds
of
the
lawn
the
garden
and
orchard
that
afford
good
hunting
for
sly
and
savage
old
thomas
when
i
was
a
boy
in
my
i
had
a
lasting
series
of
object
lessons
on
the
cat
as
a
predatory
animal
our
betty
was
the
most
ambitious
and
successful
hunter
of
wild
mammals
of
which
i
ever
have
heard
to
her
rats
and
mice
were
mere
and
after
a
time
their
pursuit
offered
such
tame
sport
that
she
sought
fresh
fields
for
her
prowess
then
she
brought
in
young
rabbits
chipmunks
and
spermophiles
and
once
she
came
in
quite
exhausted
half
dragging
and
half
carrying
a
big
fat
pocket
gopher
with
her
it
seemed
to
be
a
point
of
honor
that
she
should
bring
in
her
game
and
display
it
little
did
we
realize
then
that
in
course
of
time
the
wild
birds
would
become
so
scarce
that
their
slaughter
by
house
cats
would
demand
legislative
action
in
the
states
in
considering
the
hunting
cat
let
us
call
in
a
credible
witness
of
the
effects
of
domestic
cats
on
the
bob
white
the
following
is
an
report
by
ernest
beardsley
in
for
april
the
locality
was
wellington
sumner
county
kansas
in
the
meantime
old
queen
was
having
a
high
old
time
up
ahead
some
hundred
feet
by
then
running
up
the
bank
and
back
down
in
the
draw
we
had
hardly
caught
up
when
up
goes
savage
gun
and
he
gives
both
barrels
i
had
seen
nothing
up
to
date
but
i
did
have
long
to
wait
for
by
the
time
i
got
up
to
him
and
the
dog
they
were
both
in
the
high
grass
and
had
a
great
big
common
gray
maltese
and
queen
had
a
quail
that
cat
was
busy
with
when
disturbed
well
we
followed
the
draw
across
the
field
and
got
nine
of
a
covey
of
sixteen
that
had
been
ahead
of
cat
and
about
four
that
evening
we
killed
another
cat
while
driving
home
that
night
savage
told
me
that
he
had
killed
fifty
or
more
in
three
or
four
years
they
will
get
in
a
draw
full
of
on
a
cold
day
when
quail
do
like
to
fly
and
stay
right
with
them
and
even
after
feeding
on
two
or
three
they
will
lie
and
watch
and
when
the
covey
moves
they
move
when
eating
time
comes
around
they
are
at
it
again
and
to
a
covey
of
young
birds
they
are
sure
death
to
the
whole
covey
well
will
told
me
never
to
overlook
a
that
i
found
as
far
as
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
a
farm
or
ranch
for
if
they
have
not
already
turned
wild
they
are
learning
how
easy
it
is
to
hunt
and
live
on
game
and
are
almost
as
bad
we
found
mr
hunter
had
eaten
two
quail
just
before
we
killed
him
that
evening
i
would
rather
not
write
what
savage
said
when
we
found
the
remains
of
a
bird
my
advice
is
do
let
tame
cats
get
away
when
found
out
hunting
for
the
chances
are
they
have
not
seen
a
home
in
months
and
maybe
years
and
say
but
they
do
get
big
and
bad
when
you
meet
one
give
it
to
him
good
and
do
let
your
dog
run
up
to
him
until
he
is
out
for
keeps
i
learned
afterwards
that
was
how
will
knew
it
was
a
cat
queen
had
learned
to
back
off
and
call
for
help
on
cats
some
years
before
in
the
new
york
zoological
park
we
have
had
troubles
of
our
own
with
marauding
cats
they
establish
themselves
in
a
day
and
quickly
learn
where
to
seek
easy
game
and
good
cover
in
the
daytime
they
lie
close
in
the
thick
brush
exactly
as
tigers
do
in
india
but
if
not
molested
for
a
period
of
days
they
become
bold
and
attack
game
in
open
view
one
cat
was
so
shy
of
man
that
it
was
only
after
two
weeks
of
hard
hunting
mornings
and
evenings
that
it
was
killed
we
have
seen
cats
catch
and
kill
gray
squirrels
chipmunks
robins
and
thrushes
and
have
found
the
feathers
of
slaughtered
quail
once
we
had
gray
rabbits
breeding
in
the
park
and
their
number
reached
between
eighty
and
ninety
for
a
time
they
fearlessly
hopped
about
in
sight
from
our
windows
and
they
were
of
great
interest
to
visitors
and
to
all
of
us
then
the
cats
began
upon
them
and
in
one
year
there
was
not
a
rabbit
to
be
seen
save
at
rare
intervals
at
the
same
time
the
chipmunks
of
the
park
were
almost
exterminated
that
was
the
last
straw
and
we
began
a
vigorous
war
upon
those
wild
and
predatory
cats
the
cats
came
off
second
best
we
killed
every
cat
that
was
found
hunting
in
the
park
and
we
certainly
got
some
that
were
big
and
bad
we
eliminated
that
pest
and
we
are
keeping
it
eliminated
and
with
what
result
in
a
covey
of
eleven
quail
came
and
settled
in
our
grounds
and
have
remained
there
twenty
times
at
least
during
the
past
eight
months
winter
and
spring
i
have
seen
the
flock
on
the
granite
ledge
not
more
than
forty
feet
from
the
rear
window
of
my
office
last
spring
when
i
left
the
administration
building
at
six
after
the
visitors
had
gone
i
found
two
rabbits
calmly
roosting
on
the
the
rabbits
are
slowly
coming
back
and
the
chipmunks
are
visibly
increasing
in
number
the
gray
squirrels
now
chase
over
the
walks
without
fear
of
any
living
thing
and
our
ducklings
and
young
guineas
and
peacocks
are
safe
once
more
that
cats
destroy
annually
in
the
united
states
several
of
very
valuable
birds
seems
fairly
beyond
question
i
believe
that
in
settled
regions
they
are
worse
than
weasels
foxes
skunks
and
mink
because
there
are
about
one
hundred
times
as
many
of
them
and
those
that
hunt
are
not
afraid
to
hunt
in
the
daytime
of
course
i
am
not
saying
that
cats
hunt
wild
game
but
in
the
country
i
believe
that
fully
of
them
do
i
am
personally
acquainted
with
a
cat
in
indiana
on
the
farm
of
relatives
which
is
notorious
for
its
hunting
propensities
and
its
remarkable
ability
in
capturing
game
even
the
lady
who
is
joint
owner
of
the
cat
feels
very
badly
about
its
destructiveness
and
has
said
over
and
over
again
that
it
ought
to
be
killed
but
the
cat
is
such
a
family
pet
that
no
one
in
the
family
has
the
heart
to
destroy
it
and
as
yet
no
stranger
has
come
forward
to
play
the
part
of
executioner
the
lady
in
question
assured
me
that
to
her
certain
knowledge
that
particular
cat
would
watch
a
nestful
of
young
robins
week
after
week
until
they
had
grown
up
to
such
a
size
that
they
were
almost
ready
to
fly
then
he
would
kill
them
and
devour
them
old
tommy
was
too
wise
to
kill
the
robins
when
they
were
unduly
small
in
a
great
book
entitled
birds
and
their
by
forbush
state
ornithologist
of
massachusetts
and
published
by
the
massachusetts
state
board
of
agriculture
in
there
appears
on
page
many
interesting
facts
on
this
subject
for
example
william
brewster
tells
of
an
acquaintance
in
maine
who
said
that
his
cat
killed
about
fifty
birds
a
year
dike
wrote
to
forbush
of
a
cat
owned
by
a
family
and
well
cared
for
they
watched
it
through
one
season
and
found
that
it
killed
birds
including
the
young
in
five
nests
nearly
a
hundred
correspondents
scattered
through
all
the
counties
of
the
state
report
the
cat
as
one
of
the
greatest
enemies
of
birds
the
reports
that
have
come
in
of
the
torturing
and
killing
of
birds
by
cats
are
absolutely
sickening
the
number
of
birds
killed
by
them
in
this
state
is
appalling
some
cat
lovers
believe
that
each
cat
kills
on
the
average
not
more
than
ten
birds
a
year
but
i
have
learned
of
two
instances
where
more
than
that
number
were
killed
in
a
single
day
and
another
where
seven
were
killed
if
we
assume
however
that
the
average
cat
on
the
farm
kills
but
ten
birds
per
year
and
that
there
is
one
cat
to
each
farm
in
massachusetts
we
have
in
round
numbers
seventy
thousand
cats
killing
seven
hundred
thousand
birds
annually
illustration
a
hunting
cat
and
its
victim
this
cat
had
fed
so
bountifully
on
the
rabbits
and
squirrels
of
the
zoological
park
that
it
ate
only
the
brain
of
this
gray
rabbit
in
forbush
book
there
is
an
illustration
of
the
cat
which
killed
birds
in
one
year
and
the
animal
was
photographed
with
a
dead
robin
in
its
mouth
the
portrait
is
reproduced
in
this
chapter
last
year
a
strong
effort
was
made
in
massachusetts
to
enact
a
law
requiring
cats
to
be
licensed
on
account
of
the
amount
of
work
necessary
in
passing
the
bill
that
measure
was
not
pressed
and
so
it
did
not
become
a
law
but
another
year
it
will
undoubtedly
be
passed
for
it
is
a
good
bill
and
extremely
necessary
at
this
time
a
law
is
needed
in
every
there
is
a
mark
by
which
you
may
instantly
and
infallibly
know
the
worst
of
the
wild
cats
by
their
presence
from
home
hunting
in
the
kill
all
such
wherever
found
the
harmless
cats
are
domestic
in
their
tastes
and
stay
close
to
the
family
fireside
and
the
kitchen
being
properly
fed
they
have
no
temptation
to
become
hunters
there
are
cats
and
cats
just
as
there
are
men
and
men
some
tolerable
many
utterly
intolerable
no
sweeping
sentiment
for
cats
should
be
allowed
to
stand
in
the
way
of
the
abatement
of
the
nuisances
all
men
the
farmer
can

luxury
of

it
is
too
expensive
with
him
it
is
a
matter
of
dollars
and
cash
out
of
pocket
for
every
hunting
cat
that
he
tolerates
in
his
neighborhood
there
are
two
places
in
which
to
strike
the
hunting
cats
in
the
open
and
in
the
state
legislature
while
this
chapter
was
in
the
hands
of
the
compositors
the
hunting
cat
and
gray
rabbit
shown
in
the
accompanying
illustration
were
brought
in
by
a
keeper
dogs
as
destroyers
of
i
have
received
many
letters
from
protectors
of
wild
life
informing
me
that
the
destruction
of
birds
and
especially
of
upland
game
birds
by
roaming
dogs
has
in
some
localities
become
a
great
curse
to
bird
life
complaints
of
this
kind
have
come
from
new
york
massachusetts
connecticut
pennsylvania
and
elsewhere
usually
the
culprits
are
setters
pointers
and
hounds
now
surely
it
is
not
necessary
to
set
forth
here
any
argument
on
this
subject
it
is
not
open
to
argument
or
academic
treatment
of
any
kind
the
cold
fact
is
in
the
breeding
season
of
birds
and
while
the
young
birds
are
incapable
of
quick
and
strong
flight
all
dogs
of
every
description
should
be
restrained
from
free
hunting
and
all
dogs
found
hunting
in
the
woods
during
the
season
referred
to
should
be
arrested
and
their
owners
should
be
fined
twenty
dollars
for
each
offense
incidentally
the
fine
should
go
to
the
citizen
who
arrests
the
dog
the
method
of
restraining
hunting
dogs
should
devolve
upon
dog
owners
and
the
law
need
only
prohibit
or
punish
the
act
beyond
a
doubt
in
states
that
still
possess
quail
and
ruffed
grouse
free
hunting
by
hunting
dogs
leads
to
great
destruction
of
nests
and
broods
during
the
breeding
season
telegraph
and
telephone
mr
daniel
beard
has
strongly
called
my
attention
to
the
slaughter
of
birds
by
telegraph
wires
that
has
come
under
his
personal
observation
his
country
home
at
redding
connecticut
is
near
the
main
line
of
the
new
york
new
haven
and
hartford
railway
along
which
a
line
of
very
large
poles
carries
a
great
number
of
wires
the
wires
are
so
numerous
that
they
form
a
barrier
through
which
it
is
difficult
for
any
bird
to
fly
and
come
out
alive
and
unhurt
mr
beard
says
that
among
the
birds
killed
or
crippled
by
flying
against
those
wires
near
redding
he
has
seen
the
following
species
thrush
sparrow
and
other
sparrows
oriole
blue
jay
rail
ruffed
grouse
and
woodcock
it
is
a
common
practice
for
employees
of
the
railway
and
others
living
along
the
line
to
follow
the
line
and
pick
up
on
one
excursion
enough
birds
for
a
beyond
question
the
telegraph
and
telephone
wires
of
the
united
states
annually
exact
a
heavy
toll
in
bird
life
and
claim
countless
thousands
of
victims
they
may
well
be
set
down
as
one
of
the
unseen
forces
destructive
to
birds
naturally
we
ask
what
can
be
done
about
it
i
am
told
that
in
scotland
such
slaughter
is
prevented
by
the
attachment
of
small
tags
or
discs
to
the
telephone
wires
at
intervals
of
a
few
rods
sufficiently
near
that
they
attract
the
attention
of
flying
birds
and
reveal
the
line
of
an
obstruction
this
system
should
be
adopted
in
all
regions
where
the
conditions
are
such
that
birds
kill
themselves
against
telegraph
wires
and
an
excellent
place
to
begin
would
be
along
the
line
of
the
railway
wild
beyond
question
it
is
both
desirable
and
necessary
that
any
excess
of
wild
animals
that
prey
upon
our
grouse
quail
pheasants
woodcock
snipe
mallard
duck
shore
birds
and
other
species
that
nest
on
the
ground
should
be
killed
since
we
must
choose
between
the
two
the
birds
have
it
weasels
and
foxes
and
skunks
are
interesting
and
they
do
much
to
promote
the
hilarity
of
life
in
rural
districts
but
they
do
not
destroy
insects
and
are
of
comparatively
little
value
as
destroyers
of
the
noxious
rodents
that
prey
upon
farm
crops
while
a
few
persons
may
dispute
the
second
half
of
this
proposition
the
burden
of
proof
that
my
view
is
wrong
will
rest
upon
them
and
having
spent
eighteen
years
on
the
farm
i
think
i
am
right
if
there
is
any
positive
evidence
tending
to
prove
that
the
small
carnivores
that
we
class
as
vermin
are
industrious
and
persistent
destroyers
of
noxious
rodents
pocket
gophers
moles
and
rats
or
that
they
do
not
kill
wild
birds
numerously
now
is
the
time
to
produce
it
because
the
tide
of
public
sentiment
is
strongly
setting
against
the
weasels
mink
foxes
and
skunks
once
upon
a
time
a
shrewd
young
man
in
the
zoological
park
discovered
a
weasel
hiding
behind
a
stone
while
devouring
a
sparrow
that
it
had
just
caught
and
killed
he
stalked
it
successfully
seized
it
in
his
bare
hand
and
even
though
bitten
made
good
the
capture
the
state
of
pennsylvania
is
extensively
wooded
with
forests
and
with
brush
which
affords
excellent
home
quarters
and
breeding
grounds
for
mammalian
vermin
the
small
predatory
mammals
are
so
seriously
destructive
to
ruffed
grouse
and
other
ground
birds
that
the
state
game
commission
is
greatly
concerned
when
the
hunter
license
law
is
enacted
as
it
very
surely
will
be
at
the
next
session
of
the
legislature
a
portion
of
the
that
it
will
produce
each
year
will
be
used
by
the
commission
in
paying
bounties
on
the
destruction
of
the
surplus
of
vermin
through
the
pursuit
of
vermin
any
farmer
can
easily
win
enough
bounties
to
more
than
pay
the
cost
of
his
annual
hunting
license
one
dollar
and
the
farmers
boys
will
find
a
new
interest
in
life
in
some
portions
of
the
rocky
mountain
region
the
assaults
of
the
large
predatory
mammals
and

answer
to
permit

of

bold
and
predatory
species
to
become

numerous
in

inhabited
by

fewer
the
mountain
lions
the
better
for
they
like
the

have
nothing
to
live
upon
save
the

the
wolves
and
coyotes
have
learned
to
seek
the
ranges
of
cattle
horses
and
sheep
where
they
still
do
immense
damage
chiefly
in
killing
young
stock
in
spite
of
the
great
sums
that
have
been
paid
out
by
western
states
in
bounties
for
the
destruction
of
wolves
in
many
many
places
the
gray
wolf
still
persists
and
can
not
be
exterminated
to
the
stockmen
of

the
wolf
question
is
a
serious
matter
the
stockmen
of
montana
say
that
a
government
expert
once
told
them
how
to
get
rid
of
the
gray
wolves
his
instructions
were
locate
the
dens
and
kill
the
young
in
the
dens
soon
after
they
are
born
all
very
easy
to
but
a
trifle
difficult
to
said
my
informant
and
the
ranchman
seem
to
think
they
are
yet
a
long
way
from
a
solution
of
the
wolf
question
during
the
past
year
the
destruction
of
noxious
predatory
animals
in
the
national
forest
reserves
has
seriously
occupied
the
attention
of
the

in
a
great
while
conditions
change
in
subtle
ways
wild
creatures
unexpectedly
increase
in
number
and
a
community
awakens
to
the
fact
that
some
wild
species
has
become
a
public
nuisance
in
a
small
city
park
even
gray
squirrels
may
breed
and
become
so
fearfully
numerous
that
in
their
restless
quest
for
food
they
may
ravage
the
nests
of
the
wild
birds
kill
and
devour
the
young
and
become
a
pest
in
the
zoological
park
in
we
found
that
the
red
squirrels
had
increased
to
such
a
horde
that
they
were
driving
out
all
our
nesting
wild
birds
driving
out
the
gray
squirrels
and
making
themselves
intolerably
obnoxious
we
shot
sixty
of
them
and
brought
the
total
down
to
a
reasonable
number
wherever
he
is
or
whatever
his
numerical
strength
the
red
squirrel
is
a
bad
citizen
and
while
we
do
not
by
any
means
favor
his
extermination
he
should
resolutely
be
kept
within
bounds
by
the
rifle
when
a
crow
nested
in
our
woods
near
the
beaver
pond
we
were
greatly
pleased
but
with
the
feeding
of
the
first
brood
the
crows
began
to
carry
off
ducklings
from
the
pond
after
one
crow
had
been
seen
to
seize
and
carry
away
young
ducks
in
one
forenoon
we
decided
that
the
constitutional
limit
had
been
reached
for
we
did
not
propose
that
all
our
young
mallards
should
be
swept
into
the
awful
vortex
of
that
crow
nest
we
took
those
young
crows
and
reared
them
by
hand
but
the
old
one
had
acquired
a
bad
habit
and
she
persisted
in
carrying
off
young
ducks
until
we
had
to
end
her
existence
with
a
gun
it
was
a
painful
operation

the
destruction
of
wild
life
by
diseases
every
cause
that
has
the
effect
of
reducing
the
total
of
population
is
now
a
matter
of
importance
to
mankind
the
violent
and
universal
disturbance
of
the
balance
of
nature
that
already
has
taken
place
throughout
the
temperate
and
frigid
zone
offers
not
only
food
for
thought
but
it
calls
for
vigorous
action
there
are
vast
sections
in
the
populous
centres
of
western
civilization
where
the
destruction
of
species
even
to
the
point
of
extermination
is
fairly
inevitable
it
is
the
way
of
christian
man
to
destroy
all
wild
life
that
comes
within
the
sphere
of
influence
of
his
iron
heel
with
the
exception
of
the
big
game
this
destruction
is
largely
a
temperamental
result
peculiar
to
the
highest
civilization
in
india
where
the
same
fields
have
been
plowed
for
wheat
and
dahl
and
raggi
for
at
least
years
the
indian
antelope
or
black
buck
the
saras
crane
and
the
adjutant
stalk
through
the
crops
and
the
nilgai
and
gazelle
inhabit
the
eroded
ravines
in
an
agricultural
land
that
averages
people
to
the
square
mile
we
have
seen
that
even
in
farming
country
where
mud
villages
are
as
thick
as
farm
houses
in
nebraska
wild
animals
and
even
hoofed
game
can
live
and
hold
their
own
through
hundreds
of
years
of
close
association
with
man
the
explanation
is
that
the
hindus
regard
wild
animals
as
creatures
entitled
to
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
and
they
are
not
anxious
to
shoot
every
wild
animal
that
shows
its
head
in
the
united
states
nearly
every
community
is
animated
by
a
feeling
that
every
wild
animal
must
necessarily
be
killed
as
soon
as
seen
and
this
sentiment
often
leads
to
disgraceful
things
for
instance
in
some
parts
of
new
england
a
deer
straying
into
a
town
is
at
once
beset
by
the
hue
and
cry
and
it
is
chased
and
assaulted
until
it
is
dead
by
violent
and
disgraceful
means
new
york
state
however
seems
to
have
outgrown
that
spirit
during
the
past
ten
years
at
least
a
dozen
deer
in
distress
have
been
rescued
from
the
hudson
river
or
in
inland
towns
or
in
barnyards
in
the
suburbs
of
yonkers
and
new
york
and
carefully
cared
for
until
the
zoo
people
could
be
communicated
with
last
winter
about
exhausted
grebes
and
one
loon
were
picked
up
cared
for
and
finally
shipped
with
tender
care
to
the
zoological
park
one
distressed
dovekie
was
picked
up
but
failed
to
survive
the
sentiment
for
the
conservation
of
wild
life
has
changed
the
mental
attitude
of
very
many
people
the
old
spirit
which
cries
kill
kill
and
at
once
runs
amuck
among
suddenly
discovered
wild
animals
is
slowly
being
replaced
by
a
more
humane
and
intelligent
sentiment
this
is
one
of
the
hopeful
and
encouraging
signs
of
the
times
the
destruction
of
wild
animals
by
natural
causes
is
an
interesting
subject
even
though
painful
we
need
to
know
how
much
destruction
is
wrought
by
influences
wholly
beyond
the
control
of
man
and
a
few
cases
must
be
cited
rinderpest
in
probably
the
greatest
slaughter
ever
wrought
upon
wild
animals
by
diseases
during
historic
times
was
by
rinderpest
a
cattle
plague
which
afflicted
africa
in
the
last
decade
of
the
previous
century
originally
the
disease
reached
africa
by
way
of
egypt
and
came
as
an
importation
from
europe
from
egypt
it
steadily
traveled
southward
reaching
somaliland
in
in
it
reached
the
zambesi
river
and
entered
rhodesia
from
thence
it
went
on
southward
almost
to
the
cape
not
only
did
it
sweep
away
ninety
percent
of
the
native
cattle
but
it
also
destroyed
more
than
per
cent
of
the
buffalos
antelopes
and
other
hoofed
game
of
rhodesia
it
was
feared
that
many
species
would
be
completely
exterminated
but
happily
that
fear
was
not
realized
the
buffalo
and
antelope
herds
were
fifteen
years
in
breeding
up
again
to
a
reasonable
number
but
thanks
to
the
respite
from
hunters
which
they
enjoyed
for
several
years
finally
they
did
recover
throughout
british
east
africa
the
supply
of
big
game
in
was
very
great
but
since
that
time
it
has
been
very
greatly
diminished
by
shooting
caribou
from
time
to
time
reports
have
come
from
the
province
of
quebec
and
i
think
from
maine
and
new
brunswick
also
of
many
caribou
having
died
of
disease
the
nature
of
that
disease
has
remained
a
mystery
because
it
seems
that
no
pathologist
ever
has
had
an
opportunity
to
investigate
it
fortunately
however
the
alleged
disease
never
has
been
sufficiently
or
continuous
to
make
appreciable
inroads
on
the
total
number
of
caribou
and
apparently
the
trouble
has
been
local
scab
in
mountain
scab
is
a
contagious
and
persistent
skin
disease
that
affects
sheep
and
is
destructive
when
not
controlled
fifteen
years
ago
it
prevailed
in
some
portions
of
the
west
in
colorado
it
has
several
times
been
reported
that
many
bighorn
mountain
sheep
were
killed
by
scab
which
was
contracted
on
wild
mountain
pastures
that
had
been
gone
over
by
domestic
sheep
carrying
that
disease
from
the
reports
current
at
that
time
we
inferred
that
about
mountain
sheep
had
been
affected
it
was
feared
that
the
disease
would
spread
through
the
wild
flocks
and
become
general
but
this
did
not
occur
it
seems
that
the
remnant
flocks
had
become
so
isolated
from
one
another
that
the
isolation
of
the
affected
flocks
saved
the
others
in
antelope
and
it
is
a
lamentable
fact
that
some
at
least
of
the
united
states
herds
of
antelope
are
afflicted
with
a
very
deadly
chronic
infective
disease
known
as
actinomycosis
or
it
has
been
brought
into
the
zoological
park
five
times
by
specimens
shipped
from
colorado
texas
wyoming
and
montana
i
think
our
first
cases
came
to
us
in
in
its
early
stage
this
disease
is
so
subtle
and
slow
that
it
is
months
in
developing
and
this
feature
renders
it
all
the
more
deadly
through
the
spread
of
infection
long
before
the
ailment
can
be
discovered
one
of
our
antelope
arrivals
apparently
in
perfect
health
when
received
was
on
general
principles
kept
isolated
in
rigid
quarantine
for
two
months
at
the
expiration
of
that
period
no
disease
of
any
kind
having
become
manifest
the
animal
was
placed
on
exhibition
with
two
others
that
had
been
in
the
park
for
more
than
a
year
in
perfect
health
in
one
more
week
the
late
arrival
developed
a
swelling
on
its
jaw
drooled
at
the
corner
of
the
mouth
and
became
feverish
sure
symptoms
of
the
dread
disease
at
once
it
was
removed
and
isolated
but
in
about
days
it
died
the
other
two
antelopes
were
promptly
attacked
and
eventually
died
the
course
of
the
disease
is
very
intense
and
thus
far
it
has
proven
incurable
in
our
wild
animals
we
have
lost
about
antelopes
from
it
and
one
deer
usually
in
each
case
within
ten
days
or
two
weeks
from
the
discovery
of
the
first
outward
sign
the
well
known
swelling
on
the
jaw
one
case
that
was
detected
immediately
upon
arrival
was
very
persistently
treated
by
blair
and
the
animal
actually
survived
for
four
months
but
finally
it
succumbed
from
first
to
last
not
a
single
case
was
cured
in
the
future
of
the
antelope
in
real
captivity
seems
hopeless
we
have
decided
not
to
bring
any
more
specimens
to
our
institution
partly
because
all
available
candidates
seem
reasonably
certain
to
be
affected
with
and
partly
because
we
are
unwilling
to
run
further
risks
of
having
other
hoofed
animals
inoculated
by
them
today
we
are
anxiously
wondering
whether
the
jaw
disease
of
the
is
destined
to
exterminate
the
species
such
a
catastrophe
is
much
to
be
feared
this
is
probably
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
antelope
is
steadily
disappearing
despite
protection
in
we
discovered
the
existence
of
actinomycosis
among
the
black
mountain
sheep
of
northern
british
columbia
two
specimens
out
of
six
were
badly
affected
the
bones
of
the
jaws
being
greatly
enlarged
and
perforated
by
deep
pits
the
black
sheep
of
the
stickine
and
iskoot
regions
are
so
seldom
seen
by
white
men
save
when
a
sportsman
kills
his
allotment
of
three
specimens
we
really
do
not
know
anything
about
the
extent
to
which
actinomycosis
prevails
in
those
herds
or
how
deadly
are
its
effects
one
thing
seems
quite
certain
from
the
appearance
of
the
diseased
skulls
found
by
the
writer
in
the
taxidermic
laboratory
of
frederick
sauter
in
new
york
the
enormous
swelling
of
the
diseased
jaw
bones
clearly
indicates
a
disease
that
in
some
cases
affects
its
victim
throughout
many
months
such
a
condition
as
we
found
in
those
sheep
could
not
have
been
reached
in
a
few
days
after
the
disease
became
apparent
now
in
our
antelopes
the
collapse
and
death
of
the
victim
usually
occurred
in
about
days
from
the
time
that
the
first
swelling
was
observed
which
means
a
very
virulent
disease
and
rapid
progress
at
the
climax
the
jaw
of
one
of
our
antelopes
which
was
figured
in
blair
paper
in
the
eleventh
annual
report
of
the
new
york
zoological
society
shows
only
a
very
slight
lesion
in
comparison
with
those
of
the
mountain
sheep
the
conclusion
is
that
among
the
sheep
this
disease
does
not
carry
off
its
victims
in
any
short
period
like
days
the
animal
must
survive
for
some
months
after
it
becomes
apparent
at
least
two
parties
of
american
sportsmen
have
shot
rams
afflicted
with
this
disease
but
i
have
no
reports
of
any
sheep
having
been
found
dead
from
this
cause
this
disease
is
well
known
among
domestic
cattle
but
so
far
as
we
are
aware
it
never
before
has
been
found
among
wild
animals
the
black
sheep
herds
wherein
it
was
found
in
british
columbia
are
absolutely
isolated
from
domestic
cattle
and
all
their
influences
and
therefore
it
seems
quite
certain
that
the
disease
developed
among
the
sheep
spontaneously
a
remarkable
episode
to
say
the
least
whether
it
will
exterminate
the
black
mountain
sheep
species
and
in
time
spread
to
the
white
sheep
of
the
northwest
is
of
course
a
matter
of
conjecture
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
to
prevent
a
calamity
of
that
kind
the
white
sheep
of
yukon
territory
range
southward
until
in
the
sheslay
mountains
they
touch
the
sphere
of
influence
of
the
black
sheep
where
the
disease
could
easily
be
transmitted
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
there
existed
between
the
two
species
a
sheepless
zone
about
miles
wide
i
greatly
fear
that
actinomycosis
is
destined
to
play
an
important
part
in
the
final
extinction
that
seems
to
be
the
impending
fate
of
the
beautiful
and
valuable
antelope
in
view
of
our
hard
experiences
extending
through
ten
years
i
think
this
fear
is
justified
all
persons
who
live
in
country
still
inhabited
by
antelope
are
urged
to
watch
for
this
disease
if
any
antelopes
are
found
dead
see
if
the
lower
jaw
is
badly
swollen
and
discharging
pus
if
it
is
bury
the
body
quickly
burn
the
ground
over
and
advise
the
writer
regarding
the
case
the

one
of
the
strangest
freaks
of
nature
of
which
we
know
as
effecting
the
wholesale
destruction
of
wild

by

is
the
rabbit

in
the
northern

and
particularly
central
canada
where
rabbits
exist
in
great
numbers
and
supply
the
wants
of
a
large
carnivorous
population
this
plague
is
well
known
and
among
trappers
and
woodsmen
is
a
common
topic
of
conversation
the
best
treatment
of
the

is
to
be

the

by
a

the

history
of

is
not

but
it
may
easily
develop
that
the

therefore
it

be

for

possibly
is
all
that

geo
atkinson
a
practical
naturalist
of
portage
la
prairie
manitoba
writes
as
follows
to
a
local
paper
on
this
subject
which
i
find
quoted
in
the
the
question
which
has
developed
these
important
proportions
during
the
past
year
is
that
of
the
extent
of
the
parasitic
infection
of
our
wild
ducks
and
other
game
and
the
possibilities
of
the
extended
transmission
of
these
parasites
to
domestic
stock
or
even
humanity
by
eating
the
parasites
in
question
are
contained
in
small
elliptical
cases
found
underlying
the
surface
muscles
of
the
breast
and
in
advanced
cases
extending
deeper
into
the
flesh
and
the
muscular
tissues
of
the
legs
and
wings
they
are
not
noticeable
in
the
ordinary
process
of
plucking
the
bird
for
the
table
and
are
not
found
internally
so
that
the
only
method
of
discovering
their
presence
is
by
slitting
the
skin
of
the
breast
and
paring
it
back
a
few
inches
when
the
sacs
will
be
seen
buried
in
the
flesh
these
parasites
have
come
to
my
notice
periodically
during
the
process
of
skinning
birds
for
mounting
during
the
past
number
of
years
but
it
was
only
when
they
appeared
in
unusual
numbers
last
fall
that
i
made
inquiries
of
the
biological
bureaus
of
washington
and
ottawa
for
information
of
their
life
history
and
the
possibilities
of
their
transmission
to
other
hosts
replies
from
these
sources
surprised
me
with
the
information
that
very
little
was
known
of
the
life
history
of
any
of
the
sarcosporidia
of
which
group
this
was
a
species
nothing
was
known
of
the
method
of
infection
or
the
transference
from
host
to
host
or
species
to
species
and
both
departments
asked
for
specimens
for
examination
authorities
are
a
unit
in
opinion
that
the
question
is
one
of
great
importance
to
game
conservation
and
although
opinions
of
the
dangers
from
eating
differ
somewhat
a
record
is
given
of
a
hog
fed
upon
affected
flesh
developing
parasites
in
the
muscles
in
six
weeks
time
while
a
case
of
a
man
death
from
dropsy
was
found
to
be
the
result
of
development
of
these
parasites
in
the
valves
of
the
heart
the
ability
of
these
low
forms
of
life
to
withstand
extremes
of
heat
makes
it
necessary
for
more
than
ordinary
cooking
to
be
assured
of
killing
them
and
since
their
presence
is
unnoted
in
the
ordinary
course
of
dressing
the
birds
for
the
table
there
is
little
doubt
that
very
considerable
numbers
of
these
parasites
are
consumed
at
our
tables
every
season
with
results
at
present
unknown
to
us
the
species
i
have
found
most
particularly
infected
have
been
mallards
shovellers
teal
gadwall
and
pintails
and
the
birds
outwardly
in
the
best
condition
have
frequently
been
found
loaded
with
sacs
of
these
parasites
and
only
the
turning
back
of
the
breast
skin
can
disclose
their
presence
the
greatest
slaughter
of
wild
ducks
by
disease
occurred
on
great
salt
lake
utah
until
the
duck
disease
intestinal
coccidiosis
broke
out
there
in
the
summer
of
the
annual
market
slaughter
of
ducks
at
the
mouth
of
bear
river
had
been
enormous
when
at
salt
lake
city
in
i
made
an
effort
to
arouse
the
sportsmen
whom
i
met
to
the
necessity
of
a
reform
but
my
exhortations
fell
on
deaf
ears
naturally
the
sweeping
away
of
the
remaining
ducks
by
disease
would
suggest
a
judgment
upon
the
slaughterers
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
the
last
state
of
the
unfortunate
ducks
is
if
anything
worse
than
the
first
on
the
annual
report
of
the
chief
of
the
biological
survey
contained
the
following
information
on
this
subject
among
wild
ducks
on
great
salt
following
a
long
dry
season
which
favored
the
rearing
of
a
large
number
of
wild
ducks
but
materially
reduced
the
area
of
the
feeding
ponds
resulting
in
great
overcrowding
a
severe
epidemic
broke
out
about
august
among
the
wild
ducks
about
great
salt
lake
utah
dead
ducks
could
be
counted
by
thousands
along
the
shores
and
the
disease
raged
unabated
until
late
fall
shooting
clubs
found
it
necessary
to
declare
a
closed
season
some
of
the
dead
ducks
were
forwarded
to
the
biological
survey
and
were
turned
over
for
examination
to
the
bureau
of
animal
industry
by
the
experts
of
which
the
disease
was
diagnosed
as
intestinal
coccidiosis
various
plans
of
relieving
the
situation
were
tried
the
irrigation
ditches
were
closed
thus
providing
the
sloughs
and
ponds
with
fresh
water
and
lime
was
sprinkled
on
the
mud
flats
and
duck
trails
great
improvement
followed
this
treatment
and
experiments
proved
that
ducks
provided
with
abundant
fresh
water
and
clean
food
began
to
recover
immediately
these
methods
promised
success
but
later
it
was
proposed
that
the
marshes
be
drained
and
exposed
to
the
rays
a
course
which
can
not
be
recommended
that
coccidia
are
not
always
killed
by
exposure
to
the
sun
is
shown
by
their
survival
on
the
sites
of
old
chicken
yards
an
added
disadvantage
of
the
plan
is
that
draining
and
drying
the
marshes
would
have
a
bad
effect
on
the
natural
duck
food
and
upon
the
birds
themselves

the

wild
life
must
either
adjust
itself
to
the
conditions
that
civilized
man
imposes
upon
it
or
perish
i
say
civilized
man
for
the
reason
that
the
primitive
races
of
man
are
not
deadly
exterminators
of
species
as
we
are
i
know
of
not
one
species
of
wild
life
that
has
been
exterminated
by
savage
man
without
the
aid
of
his
civilized
peers
as
civilization
marches
ever
onward
over
the
prairies
into
the
bad
lands
and
the
forests
over
the
mountains
and
even
into
the
farthest
corner
of
death
valley
the
desert
of
deserts
the
struggle
of
the
wild
birds
mammals
and
fishes
is
daily
and
hourly
intensified
man
must
help
them
to
maintain
themselves
or
accept
a
lifeless
continent
the
best
help
consists
in
letting
the
wild
creatures
throughly
alone
so
that
they
can
help
themselves
but
quail
often
need
to
be
fed
in
critical
periods
the
best
food
is
wheat
screenings
placed
under
little
tents
of
straw
bringing
food
and
shelter
together
in
the
well
settled
portions
of
the
united
states
such
species
as
quail
ruffed
grouse
wild
turkey
pinnated
grouse
and
sage
grouse
hang
to
life
by
slender
threads
a
winter
of
exceptionally
deep
snows
much
sleet
and
a
late
spring
always
causes
grave
anxiety
among
the
state
game
wardens
in
pennsylvania
a
very
earnest
movement
is
in
progress
to
educate
and
persuade
farmers
to
feed
the
quail
in
winter
and
much
good
is
being
done
in
that
direction
erasmus
wilson
of
the
is
the
apostle
of
that
movement
should
be
fed
every
winter
in
every
northern
the
methods
to
be
pursued
will
be
mentioned
elsewhere
by
way
of
illustration
here
is
a
sample
game
report
from
las
animas
colorado
after
the
most
severe
winter
weather
experienced
for
twenty
years
we
are
able
to
compute
approximately
our
loss
of
feathered
life
it
is
per
cent
of
the
quail
throughout
the
irrigated
district
and
about
twenty
per
cent
of
in
the
rough
sections
south
of
the
arkansas
river
the
loss
among
the
quail
was
much
lighter
the
ground
sparrows
suffered
severely
while
the
english
sparrow
seems
to
have
come
through
in
good
shape
many
rabbits
starved
to
death
while
the
deep
light
snow
of
january
made
them
easy
prey
for
hawks
and
coyotes
webber
it
would
be
possible
to
record
many
instances
similar
to
the
above
but
why
multiply
them
and
now
behold
the
cruel
corollary
at
least
times
during
the
past
two
years
i
have
heard
and
read
arguments
by
sportsmen
against
my
proposal
for
a
close
season
for
quail
taking
the
ground
that
the
sportsmen
are
not
wholly
to
blame
for
the
scarcity
of
quail
it
is
the
cold
winters
that
kill
them
off
so
then
the
fierce
winters
murder
the
bob
white
wholesale
they
should
not
have
a
chance
to
recover
could
human
beings
possibly
assume
a
more
absurd
attitude
yes
it
is
coldly
and
incontestably
true
that
even
after
such
winter
slaughter
as
webber
has
reported
above
the
very
next
season
will
find
the
quail
hunter
joyously
taking
the
field
his
face
beaming
with
health
and
good
living
to
hunt
down
and
shoot
to
death
as
many
as
possible
of
the
pitiful
per
cent
remnant
that
managed
to
survive
the
pitiless
winter
how
many
quail
hunters
think
you
ever
stayed
their
hands
because
of
a
hard
winter
on
the
quail
i
warrant
not
one
out
of
every
hundred
how
many
states
in
this
union
ever
put
on
a
close
season
because
of
a
hard
winter
i
warrant
that
not
one
ever
did
and
i
think
there
is
only
one
state
whose
game
commissioners
have
the
power
to
act
in
that
way
without
recourse
to
the
legislature
this
situation
is
intolerable

to
the
splendid
codified
game

i
want
all
sensible
honest
sportsmen
to
stop
citing
the
killing
of
game
birds
by
severe
winters
a
why
long
close
seasons
are
not
necessary
and
why
automatic
guns
do
matter
and
i
want
sportsmen
to
consider
their
duty
and
not
go
out
hunting
any
game
species
that
has
been
slaughtered
by
a
hard
winter
until
it
has
had
at
least
five
years
in
which
to
recover
any
other
course
is
cruel
selfish
and
shortsighted
and
a
word
to
the
humane
should
be
sufficient
the
worst
exhibitions
ever
made
of
the
wolfish
instinct
to
slay
that
springs
eternal
in
some
human
breasts
are
those
brought
about
through
the
distress
or
errors
of
wild
animals
by
way
of
illustration
consider
the
slaughter
of
elk
that
took
place
in
the
edge
of
idaho
in
the
winter
of
and
when
about
seven
hundred
elk
that
were
driven
out
of
the
yellowstone
park
at
its
northwestern
corner
by
the
deep
snow
fled
into
idaho
in
the
hope
of
finding
food
the
inhabitants
met
the
starving
herds
with
repeating
rifles
and
as
the
unfortunate
animals
struggled
westward
through
the
snow
and
storm
they
were
slaughtered
without
mercy
bulls
and
cows
old
and
young
all
of
the
seven
hundred
went
down
and
stoney
indians
could
not
have
acted
any
worse
than
did
those
settlers
on
another
occasion
it
is
recorded
that
the
antelope
herd
of
the
mammoth
hot
springs
wandered
across
the
line
into
gardiner
and
quickly
met
a
savage
attack
of
gunners
with
rifles
a
number
of
those
rare
and
valuable
animals
were
killed
and
others
fled
back
into
the
park
with
broken
legs
dangling
in
the
air
in
the
interest
of
public
decency
and
for
the
protection
of
the
reputation
of
american
citizenship
one
of
two
things
should
be
done
the
northern
boundary
of
the
park
should
be
extended
northward
beyond
gardiner
or
else
the
deathtrap
should
be
moved
elsewhere
the
case
of
the
town
of
gardiner
is
referred
to
the
legislature
of
montana
for
treatment
beyond
question
the
highest
sentiments
of
humanity
are
those
that
are
stirred
by
the
misfortunes
of
killable
game
during
the
past
thirty
years
i
have
noticed
some
interesting
manifestations
of
the
increased
sympathy
for
wild
creatures
that
steadily
is
growing
in
a
large
section
of
the
public
mind
thirty
years
ago
the
appearance
of
a
deer
or
moose
in
the
streets
of
any
eastern
village
nearly
always
was
in
itself
a
signal
for
a
grand
chase
of
the
unfortunate
creature
and
its
speedy
slaughter
today
in
the
eastern
states
the
general
feeling
is
quite
different
the
appearance
of
a
deer
in
the
hudson
river
itself
or
a
moose
in
a
maine
village
is
a
signal
not
for
a
wild
chase
and
cruel
slaughter
but
for
a
general
effort
to
save
the
animal
from
being
hurt
or
killed
i
know
this
through
ocular
proof
at
least
half
a
dozen
lost
and
bewildered
deer
having
been
carefully
driven
into
yards
or
barns
and
humanely
kept
and
cared
for
until
they
could
be
shipped
to
us
several
have
been
caught
while
swimming
in
the
hudson
bewildered
and
the
latest
capture
occurred
in
new
york
city
itself
a
puma
that
escaped
about
from
the
zoological
park
instead
of
being
shot
was
captured
by
sensible
people
in
the
hamlet
of
bronxdale
alive
and
unhurt
and
safely
returned
to
us
in
some
portions
of
the
east
though
not
all
the
day
of
the
hue
and
cry
over
a
wild
animal
in
town
seems
to
be
about
over
on
long
island
some
humane
persons
found
an
injured
turkey
vulture
and
took
it
in
and
cared
for
it
only
to
be
persecuted
by
game
wardens
because
they
had
a
forbidden
wild
bird
in
their
possession
there
are
times
when
it
is
the
highest
moral
duty
of
a
game
warden
to
follow
the
advice
of
private
mulvaney
to
the
orficer
boy
and
shut
yer
oye
to
the
rigulations
sorr
such
occurrences
as
these
are
becoming
more
and
more
common
desire
of
the
great
silent
majority
is
to
save
the
wild
and
it
is
in
response
to
that
sentiment
that
thousands
of
people
are
today
in
the
field
against
the
army
of
destruction
it
is
the
duty
of
every
sportsman
to
assist
in
promoting
the
passage
of
a
law
like
our
new
york
law
which
empowers
the
state
game
commission
to
throw
extra
protection
around
any
species
that
has
been
slaughtered
too
much
by
snow
or
by
firearms
by
closing
the
open
season
as
long
as
may
be
necessary
can
there
be
in
all
america
even
one
thinking
reasoning
being
who
can
not
see
the
justice
and
also
the
imperative
necessity
of
this
measure
it
seems
impossible
give
the
game
the
benefit
of
every
doubt
if
it
becomes
too
thick
your
gun
can
quickly
thin
it
out
but
if
it
is
once
exterminated
it
will
be
impossible
to
bring
it
back
be
wise
and
take
thought
for
the
morrow
remember
the
heath
hen
slaughter
of
in
the
late
winter
and
early
spring
of
the
wave
of
bluebirds
was
caught
on
its
northward
migration
by
a
period
of
unseasonably
cold
and
fearfully
tempestuous
weather
involving
much
rain
and
sleet
now
there
is
no
other
climatic
condition
that
is
so
hard
for
a
wild
bird
or
mammal
to
withstand
as
rain
at
the
freezing
point
and
a
mantle
of
ice
or
frozen
snow
over
all
supplies
of
food
the
bluebirds
perished
by
thousands
the
loss
occurred
practically
all
along
their
line
of
migration
from
arkansas
to
the
atlantic
coast
in
places
the
species
seemed
almost
exterminated
and
it
was
several
years
ere
it
recovered
to
a
point
even
faintly
approximating
its
original
population
i
am
quite
certain
that
the
species
never
has
recovered
more
than
per
cent
of
the
number
that
existed
previous
to
the
calamity
duck
cholera
in
the
bronx
in
some
unknown
but
new
and
particularly
deadly
element
probably
introduced
in
sewage
contaminated
the
waters
of
bronx
river
where
it
flows
through
new
york
city
with
results
very
fatal
in
the
zoological
park
the
large
flock
of
mallard
ducks
canada
geese
and
snow
geese
on
lake
agassiz
was
completely
wiped
out
in
all
about
waterfowl
died
in
rapid
succession
from
causes
commonly
classed
under
the
popular
name
of
duck
cholera
the
disease
was
carried
to
other
bodies
of
water
in
the
park
that
were
fed
from
other
sources
but
made
no
headway
elsewhere
than
on
lakes
fed
by
the
polluted
bronx
river
fortunately
the
work
of
the
bronx
river
parkway
commission
soon
will
terminate
the
present
very
unsanitary
condition
of
that
stream
wild
ducks
in
in
the
winter
of
many
flocks
of
wild
ducks
decided
to
winter
in
the
north
many
persons
believe
that
this
was
largely
due
to
the
prevention
of
late
winter
and
spring
shooting
which
seems
reasonable
unfortunately
the
winter
referred
to
proved
exceptionally
severe
and
formed
vast
sheets
of
thick
ice
over
the
where
the
ducks
had
expected
to
obtain
their
food
on
cayuga
seneca
and
other
lakes
in
central
new
york
and
on
the
island
of
martha
vineyard
the
flocks
of
ducks
suffered
very
severely
and
many
perished
of
hunger
and
cold
for
the
laws
prohibiting
late
winter
shooting
undoubtedly
all
of
them
would
have
been
shot
and
eaten
regardless
of
their
game
wardens
and
humane
citizens
made
numerous
efforts
to
feed
the
starving
flocks
and
many
ducks
were
saved
in
that
way
an
illustrated
article
on
the
distressed
ducks
of
keuka
lake
by
william
beebe
and
verdi
burtch
appeared
in
the
society
for
may
fortunately
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
such
occurrences
will
be
rare
wild
swans
swept
over
niagara
during
the
past
ten
years
several
winter
tragedies
to
birds
have
occurred
on
a
large
scale
at
niagara
falls
whole
flocks
of
whistling
swans
of
from
up
to
individuals
alighting
in
the
niagara
river
above
the
rapids
have
permitted
themselves
to
float
down
into
the
rapids
and
be
swept
over
the
falls
en
masse
on
each
occasion
the
great
majority
of
the
birds
were
drowned
or
killed
on
the
rocks
of
the
very
few
that
survived
few
if
any
were
able
to
rise
and
fly
out
of
the
gorge
below
the
falls
to
safety
it
is
my
impression
that
about
swans
recently
have
perished
in
this
strange
way
chapter
xi
slaughter
of
by
italians
in
these
days
of
slaughter
we
hear
much
of
death
and
destruction
before
our
eyes
there
continually
arise
photographs
of
hanging
masses
of
waterfowl
grouse
pheasants
deer
and
fish
usually
supported
in
true
heraldic
fashion
by
the
men
who
slew
them
and
the
implements
of
slaughter
the
world
has
become
somewhat
hardened
to
these
things
because
the
victims
are
classed
as
game
and
in
the
destruction
of
game
one
more
or
less
will
not
count
in
the
news
of
the
battle
the
slaughter
of
song
insectivorous
and
all
other
birds
by
italians
and
other
aliens
from
southern
europe
has
become
a
scourge
to
the
bird
life
of
this
country
the
devilish
work
of
the
negroes
and
poor
whites
of
the
south
will
be
considered
in
the
next
chapter
in
italy
linnets
and
sparrows
are
game
and
so
is
everything
else
that
wears
feathers
italy
is
a
continuous
for
the
migratory
birds
of
europe
and
as
such
it
is
an
international
nuisance
and
a
pest
the
way
passerine
birds
are
killed
and
eaten
in
that
country
is
a
disgrace
to
the
government
of
italy
and
a
standing
reproach
to
the
throne
even
kings
and
parliaments
have
no
right
in
moral
or
international
law
to
permit
year
after
year
the
wholesale
slaughter
of
birds
of
passage
of
species
that
no
civilized
man
has
a
right
to
kill
there
are
some
tales
of
slaughter
from
which
every
christian
mind
is
bound
to
recoil
with
horror
one
such
tale
has
recently
been
given
to
us
in
the
pages
of
the
of
london
for
january
by
hubert
astley
whose
word
no
man
will
dispute
in
condensing
it
let
us
call
it
the
italian
slaughter
of
the
innocents
this
story
does
not
concern
game
birds
of
any
kind
quite
the
contrary
that
it
should
be
published
in
america
a
land
now
rapidly
filling
up
with
italians
is
a
painful
necessity
in
order
that
the
people
of
america
may
be
enabled
accurately
to
measure
the
fatherland
traditions
and
the
fixed
mental
attitude
of
italians
generally
toward
our
song
birds
i
shall
now
hold
a
mirror
up
to
italian
nature
if
the
image
is
either
hideous
or
grotesque
the
fault
will
not
be
mine
i
specially
commend
the
picture
to
the
notice
of
american
game
wardens
and
judges
on
the
bench
the
american
reader
must
be
reminded
that
the
italian
peninsula
reaches
out
a
long
arm
of
land
into
the
mediterranean
sea
for
several
hundred
miles
toward
the
sunny
barbary
coast
of
north
africa
this
great
southward
highway
has
been
chosen
by
the
birds
of
central
europe
as
their
favorite
migration
route
especially
is
this
true
of
the
small
with
weak
wings
and
a
minimum
of
power
for
flight
naturally
they
follow
the
peninsula
down
to
the
italian
end
before
they
launch
forth
to
dare
the
passage
of
the
mediterranean
illustration
an
italian
roccolo
on
lake
como
a
for
from
the
avicultural
magazine
italy
is
the
narrow
end
of
a
great
continental
funnel
into
the
wide
northern
end
of
which
germany
austria
france
and
switzerland
annually
pour
their
volume
of
migratory
bird
life
and
what
is
the
result
for
answer
let
us
take
the
testimony
of
two
reliable
witnesses
and
file
it
for
use
on
the
day
when
tony
macchewin
gun
in
hand
and
pockets
bulging
with
cartridges
goes
afield
in
our
country
and
opens
fire
on
our
birds
the
linnet
is
one
of
the
sweet
singers
of
europe
it
is
a
small
delicately
formed
little
bird
about
the
size
of
our
it
weighs
only
a
trifle
more
than
a
girl
where
it
breeds
and
rears
its
young
in
germany
for
example
a
true
sportsman
would
no
more
think
of
shooting
a
linnet
than
he
would
of
killing
and
eating
his
daughter
dearest
canary
to
the
migrating
bird
the
approach
to
northern
italy
either
going
or
returning
is
not
through
a
land
of
plenty
the
sheltering
forests
have
mostly
been
swept
away
and
safe
shelters
for
small
birds
are
very
rare
in
the
open
there
are
owls
and
hawks
and
the
only
refuge
from
either
is
the
grove
into
which
linnets
and
pipits
can
dive
at
the
approach
of
danger
and
quickly
hide
a
linnet
from
the
north
after
days
of
dangerous
travel
finally
reached
lake
como
southward
bound
the
country
was
much
too
open
for
safety
and
its
first
impulse
was
to
look
about
for
safe
shelter
the
low
bushes
that
sparsely
covered
the
steep
hillsides
were
too
thin
for
refuge
in
times
of
sudden
danger
ah
upon
a
hilltop
is
a
little
grove
of
trees
green
and
inviting
in
the
grove
a
bird
is
calling
calling
insistently
the
trees
are
very
small
but
they
seem
to
stand
thickly
together
and
their
foliage
should
afford
a
haven
from
both
hawk
and
gunner
to
it
joyously
flits
the
tired
linnet
as
it
perches
aloft
upon
a
convenient
wand
it
notices
for
the
first
time
a
queer
square
brick
tower
of
small
dimensions
rising
in
the
center
of
a
surrounded
by
trees
the
tower
is
like
an
old
and
dingy
turret
that
has
been
shorn
from
a
castle
and
set
on
the
hilltop
without
apparent
reason
it
is
two
stories
in
height
with
one
window
dingy
and
uninviting
a
door
opens
into
its
base
several
birds
that
seem
very
near
but
are
invisible
frequently
call
and
chirp
as
if
seeking
answering
calls
and
companionship
surely
the
grove
must
be
a
safe
place
for
birds
or
they
would
not
be
here
hark
a
whirring
whistling
sound
fills
the
air
like
the
air
tone
of
a
flying
hawk
wings
a
hawk
a
hawk
down
plunges
the
scared
linnet
blindly
frantically
into
the
space
sheltered
by
the
grove
horrors
what
is
this
threads
invisible
interlacing
threads
tangled
and
full
of
pockets
treacherously
spanning
the
open
space
it
is
a
fowler
net
the
linnet
is
entangled
it
flutters
frantically
but
helplessly
and
hangs
there
caught
its
alarm
cry
is
frantically
answered
by
the
two
strange
invisible
bird
voices
that
come
from
the
top
of
the
tower
the
grove
and
the
tower
are
a
roccolo
a
huge
permanent
merciless
deadly
for
the
wholesale
capture
of
songbirds
the
tower
is
the
hiding
place
of
the
fowler
and
the
calling
birds
are
decoy
birds
whose
eyes
have
been
totally
blinded
by
wires
in
order
that
they
will
call
more
frantically
than
birds
with
eyes
would
do
the
whistling
wings
that
seemed
a
hawk
were
a
sham
made
by
a
racquet
thrown
through
the
air
by
the
fowler
through
a
slot
in
his
tower
he
keeps
by
him
many
such
racquets
the
door
of
the
tower
opens
and
out
comes
the
fowler
he
is
lowbrowed
swarthy
ill
kept
and
wears
rings
in
his
ears
a
soiled
hand
seizes
the
struggling
linnet
and
drags
it
violently
from
the
threads
that
entangled
it
a
twig
is
thrust
straight
through
the
head
of
the
helpless
victim
the
and
after
one
wild
fluttering
agony
it
is
dead
the
fowler
sighs
contentedly
his
dirty
and
tower
tosses
the
feathered
atom
upon
the
pile
of
dead
birds
that
lies
upon
the
dirty
floor
in
a
dirty
corner
and
is
ready
for
the
next
one
ask
him
as
did
astley
and
he
will
tell
you
frankly
that
there
are
about
dead
birds
in
the
pile
starlings
sparrows
linnets
greenfinches
chaffinches
goldfinches
hawfinches
redstarts
blackcaps
robins
song
thrushes
blackbirds
blue
and
coal
tits
fieldfares
and
redwings
he
will
tell
you
also
that
there
are
other
roccolos
within
sight
and
twelve
within
easy
walking
he
will
tell
you
as
he
did
astley
that
during
that
week
he
had
taken
about
birds
and
that
that
number
was
a
fair
average
for
each
of
the
other
roccolos
this
means
the
destruction
of
about
songbirds
per
week
that
neighborhood
alone
another
keeper
of
a
roccolo
told
astley
that
during
the
previous
autumn
he
took
about
birds
at
his
small
and
comparatively
insignificant
roccolo
and
above
that
awful
roccolo
of
slaughtered
innocents
rose
wooden
in
memory
of
christ
the
merciful
the
compassionate
around
the
interior
of
the
entwined
sapling
tops
that
formed
the
fatal
bower
of
death
there
hung
a
semicircle
of
tiny
cages
containing
live
decoys
chaffinches
hawfinches
titmice
and
several
other
species
the
older
and
staider
ones
call
repeatedly
says
astley
and
the
chaffinches
break
into
song
it
is
the
only
song
to
be
heard
in
italy
at
the
time
of
the
autum
migration
and
the
king
of
italy
the
queen
of
italy
the
parliament
of
italy
and
his
holiness
the
pope
permit
these
things
year
in
and
year
out
it
is
now
said
however
that
through
the
efforts
of
a
recently
organized
society
in
italy
the
blinding
of
decoy
birds
for
roccolos
is
to
be
stopped
in
germany
austria
and
switzerland
the
protection
of
these
birds
during
their
breeding
season
must
be
very
effective
for
otherwise
the
supply
for
the
italian
slaughter
of
the
innocents
would
long
ago
have
fallen
to
nothing
the
germans
love
birds
and
all
wild
life
i
wonder
how
they
like
the
italian
roccolo
i
wonder
how
france
regards
it
and
whether
the
nations
of
europe
north
of
italy
will
endure
this
situation
forever
to
the
american
and
english
reader
comment
on
the
practices
recorded
above
is
quite
unnecessary
except
the
observation
that
they
betoken
a
callousness
of
feeling
and
a
depth
of
cruelty
and
destructiveness
to
which
so
far
as
known
no
savages
ever
yet
have
sunk
as
an
exhibit
of
the
groveling
pusillanimity
of
the
human
soul
the
roccolo
of
northern
italy
reveals
minus
qualities
which
can
not
be
expressed
either
in
words
or
in
figures
and
what
is
the
final
exhibit
of
the
gallant
knight
of
the
roccolo
the
feudal
lord
of
the
modern
castle
and
its
retainers
the
answer
is
given
by
louis
bishop
in
an
article
on
birds
in
the
markets
of
southern
europe
in
venice
which
was
visited
in
october
and
november
during
the
fall
migration
he
found
on
sale
in
the
markets
as
food
thousands
of
songbirds
birds
were
there
in
profusion
from
ducks
to
kites
in
the
early
morning
hung
in
great
bunches
above
the
stalls
but
by
most
of
them
had
been
sold
ducks
and
shorebirds
occurred
in
some
numbers
but
the
vast
majority
were
small
sparrows
larks
and
thrushes
these
were
there
during
my
visit
by
the
thousands
if
not
ten
thousands
to
the
market
they
were
brought
in
large
sacks
strung
in
fours
on
twigs
which
had
been
passed
through
the
eyes
and
then
tied
most
of
these
small
birds
had
been
trapped
and
on
skinning
them
i
often
could
find
no
injury
except
at
their
eyes
c
one
of
these
sacks
which
i
examined
on
november
contained
hundreds
of
birds
largely
siskins
skylarks
and
bramblings
as
a
rule
the
small
birds
that
were
not
sold
in
the
early
morning
were
skinned
or
picked
and
their
tiny
bodies
packed
in
regular
order
breasts
up
in
shadow
tin
boxes
and
exposed
for
sale
footnote
c
it
is
probable
that
these
birds
were
killed
by
piercing
the
head
through
the
eyes
during
these
visits
to
the
venetian
markets
i
identified
species
and
procured
specimens
of
most
as
nearly
as
i
can
remember
small
birds
cost
from
two
to
five
cents
apiece
for
example
i
paid
on

redpoll

thrush
linnets
goldfinches
titmouse
siskins
great
titmouse
reed

and

on

i
paid
for

greenfinches
sparrow

wrens
woodcock
great

common
redshank
blue

dusky

and
dunlins
of
course
there
were
various
species
of
upland
game
birds
and
waterfowl
everything
in
fact
that
could
be
found
and
killed
in
addition
to
the
passerine
birds
listed
above
bishop
noted
the
following
all
in
venice
alone
skylark
in
great
numbers
crested

crossbill
calandra
house
sparrow

sparrow
stonechat
hawfinch
coal

white
wagtail
song
thrush
redwing
in
florence
says
bishop
i
visited
the
central
market
on
november
december
and
and
found
birds
even
more
plentiful
than
in
venice
besides
a
variety
of
game
birds
he
found
quantities
of
the
species
mentioned
above
seen
in
venice
and
also
the
following
green
sandpiper
brown
creeper
dotterel
nuthatch
magpie
warbler
corn
bunting
warbler
migratory
quail
fantail
warbler
green
woodpecker
missel
thrush
spotted
woodpecker
ring
ouzel
wood
lark
rock
sparrow
and
gray
wagtail
here
too
at
florence
we
saw
often
bunches
and
baskets
of
small
birds
chiefly
redbreasts
hawked
through
the
streets
every
sunday
that
we
went
into
the
country
we
met
numbers
of
italians
out
shooting
and
their
bags
seemed
to
consist
wholly
of
small
birds
at
genoa
san
remo
monte
carlo
and
nice
between
december
and
i
did
not
visit
the
central
markets
if
such
exist
but
saw
frequently
bunches
of
small
birds
hanging
outside
stores
a
gentleman
who
spent
the
fall
on
an
automobile
trip
through
the
west
of
france
brittany
to
the
pyrenees
tells
me
he
noticed
these
bunches
of
small
birds
on
sale
in
every
town
he
that
killing
for
food
continues
bishop
is
not
confined
to
the
poor
italians
i
learned
on
october
when
one
of
the
most
prominent
and
wealthy
italian
a
delightful
man
told
me
he
had
shot
skylarks
and
pipits
the
day
before
and
that
his
family
liked
them
far
better
than
other
game
our
prejudice
against
selling
game
does
not
exist
in
europe
and
this
same
ornithologist
told
me
he
often
shot
ducks
in
a
day
at
his
sending
to
the
market
what
he
could
not
use
himself
on
november
he
shot
ducks
and
on
november
chiefly
widgeon
and
teal
an
ornithologist
indeed
a
sportsman
also
is
he
not
he
belongs
with
his
brother
ornithologists
of
the
roccolos
who
net
their
game
with
the
aid
of
birds
brave
men
gallant
sportsmen
are
these
men
of
italy
and
western
france
also
if
the
tale
is
true
if
the
people
of
europe
can
stand
the
wholesale
systematic
slaughter
of
their
song
and
insectivorous
birds
if
they
are
too
to
rise
up
make
a
row
about
it
and
stop
it
then
let
them
pay
the
price
but
by
the
eternal
antonio
shall
not
come
to
this
country
with
the
tastes
of
the
roccolo
and
indulge
them
here
the
above
facts
have
been
cited
not
at
all
for
the
benefit
of
europe
but
for
our
own
good
the
american
people
are
now
confronted
by
the
italian
and
austrian
and
hungarian
laborer
and
and
mechanic
and
all
americans
should
have
an
exact
measure
of
the
sentiments
of
southern
europe
toward
our
wild
life
generally
especially
the
birds
that
we
do
not
shoot
at
all
therefore
are
easy
to
when
a
warden
or
a
citizen
arrests
an
alien
for
killing
any
of
our
birds
show
the
judge
these
records
of
how
they
do
things
in
italy
and
ask
for
the
extreme
penalty
i
have
taken
pains
to
publish
the
above
facts
from
in
order
that
every
game
commissioner
game
warden
and
state
legislator
who
reads
these
pages
may
know
exactly
what
he
is
up
against
in
the
alien
population
of
our
country
from
southern
europe
for
unnumbered
generations
the
people
of
italy
have
been
taught
to
believe
that
it
is
to
shoot
and
devour
every
that
flies
the
venetian
is
no
respecter
of
species
and
when
an
italian
ornithologist
can
go
out
and
murder
linnets
and
pipits
in
one
day
for
the
pot
it
is
time
for
americans
to
think
hard
we
sincerely
hope
that
it
will
not
require
blows
and
kicks
and
fines
to
remove
from
antonio
head
the
idea
that
america
is
not
italy
and
that
the
slaughter
of
song
birds
do
go
in
this
country
i
strongly
recommend
to
every
state
the
enactment
of
a
law
that
will
do
these
things
prohibit
the
owning
carrying
or
use
of
firearms
by
aliens
and
prohibit
the
use
of
firearms
in
hunting
by
any
naturalized
alien
from
southern
europe
until
after
a
residence
in
america
from
reports
that
have
come
to
me
at
first
hand
regarding
italians
in
the
east
hungarians
in
pennsylvania
and
austrians
in
minnesota
it
seems
absolutely
certain
that
all
members
of
the
lower
classes
of
southern
europe
are
a
dangerous
menace
to
our
wild
life
on
account
of
the
idea
every
foreigner
who
sails
past
the
statue
on
bedloe
island
and
lands
on
our
shore
is
firmly
convinced
that
at
he
can
do
as
he
pleases
and
as
one
of
his
first
ways
in
which
to
show
his
personal
liberty
and
independence
in
the
land
of
easy
marks
he
buys
a
gun
and
goes
out
to
shoot
free
game
if
we
as
a
people
are
so
indolent
and
so
somnolent
that
antonio
gets
away
with
all
our
wild
birds
then
do
we
deserve
to
be
robbed
italians
are
pouring
into
america
in
a
steady
stream
they
are
strong
prolific
persistent
and
of
tireless
energy
new
york
city
now
contains
of
them
they
work
while
the
native
americans
sleep
wherever
they
settle
their
tendency
is
to
root
out
the
native
american
and
take
his
place
and
his
income
toward
wild
life
the
italian
laborer
is
a
human
mongoose
give
him
power
to
act
and
he
will
quickly
exterminate
every
wild
thing
that
wears
feathers
or
hair
to
our
songbirds
he
is
literally
a
pestilence
that
walketh
at
noonday
as
we
have
shown
the
italian
is
a
born
and
he
has
grown
up
in
the
fixed
belief
that
killing
for
food
is
right
to
him
all
is
game
that
goes
into
the
bag
the
moment
he
sets
foot
in
the
open
he
provides
himself
with
a
and
he
looks
about
for
things
to
kill
it
is
a
free
country
therefore
he
may
kill
anything
he
can
find
cook
it
and
eat
it
if
anybody
attempts
to
check
him
sapristi
beware
his
gun
he
cheerfully
invades
your
fields
and
even
your
lawn
and
he
shoots
robins
bluebirds
thrushes
catbirds
grosbeaks
tanagers
orioles
woodpeckers
quail
snipe
ducks
crows
and
herons
down
in
virginia
near
charlottesville
an
italian
who
was
working
on
a
new
railroad
once
killed
a
turkey
buzzard
and
he
selfishly
cooked
it
and
ate
it
all
alone
a
compatriot
of
his
heard
of
it
and
reproached
him
for
on
game
in
camera
in
the
quarrel
that
ensued
one
of
the
sportsmen
stabbed
the
other
to
death
when
the
new
york
zoological
society
began
work
on
its
park
in
the
northern
half
of
the
borough
of
the
bronx
was
a
regular
daily
for
the
slaughter
of
and
all
other
birds
that
could
be
found
every
sunday
it
was
bangetty
bang
from
pelham
bay
to
van
cortlandt
the
police
force
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
to
these
open
flagrant
shameless
violations
of
the
city
ordinances
and
the
state
bird
laws
in
those
days
i
never
but
once
heard
of
a
policeman
his
own
arresting
a
birdshooter
even
on
sunday
but
whenever
meddlesome
special
wardens
from
the
zoological
park
have
pointedly
called
upon
the
local
police
force
for
help
it
has
always
been
given
with
cheerful
alacrity
in
the
fall
of
an
appeal
to
the
police
commissioner
resulted
in
a
general
order
to
stop
all
hunting
and
shooting
in
the
borough
of
the
bronx
and
a
reform
is
now
on
the
war
on
the
in
new
york
city
began
in
it
seemed
that
if
the
zoological
society
did
not
take
up
the
matter
the
slaughter
would
continue
indefinitely
the
white
man
burden
was
taken
up
and
the
story
of
the
war
is
rather
illuminating
shields
president
of
the
league
of
american
sportsmen
quickly
became
interested
in
the
matter
and
entered
actively
into
the
campaign
for
months
unnumbered
he
spent
every
sunday
patroling
the
woods
and
thickets
of
northern
new
york
and
westchester
county
usually
accompanied
by
john
j
rose
and
rudolph
bell
of
the
zoological
park
force
for
whom
appointments
as
deputy
game
wardens
had
been
secured
from
the
state
the
adventures
of
that
redoubtable
trio
of
would
make
an
interesting
chapter
they
were
shot
at
by
poachers
but
more
frequently
they
shot
at
the
other
fellows
just
why
it
was
that
no
one
was
killed
no
one
seems
to
know
many
italians
and
several
americans
were
arrested
while
hunting
haled
to
court
prosecuted
and
fined
finally
a
reign
of
terror
set
in
and
that
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
it
became
known
that
those
three
men
could
not
be
stopped
by
threats
and
that
they
always
got
their
man
unless
he
got
into
a
human
of
the
italian
species
that
was
the
only
escape
that
was
possible
the
largest
haul
of
dead
birds
was
robins
orioles
thrushes
and
woodpeckers
captured
along
with
the
five
italians
who
committed
the
indiscretion
of
sitting
down
in
the
woods
to
divide
their
dead
birds
we
saved
all
the
birds
in
alcohol
and
showed
them
in
court
the
judge
fined
two
of
the
italians
each
and
the
other
three
were
sent
to
the
penitentiary
for
two
months
each
even
yet
however
at
long
intervals
an
occasional
son
of
sunny
italy
tries
his
luck
at
sunday
bird
shooting
but
if
anyone
yells
at
him
to
halt
he
throws
away
his
gun
and
stampedes
through
the
brush
like
a
frightened
deer
the
birds
of
upper
new
york
are
now
fairly
secure
but
it
has
taken
ten
years
of
fighting
to
bring
it
about
throughout
new
york
state
pennsylvania
new
jersey
connecticut
massachusetts
and
even
minnesota
wherever
there
are
large
settlements
of
italians
and
hungarians
the
reports
are
the
same
they
swarm
through
the
country
every
sunday
and
shoot
every
wild
thing
they
see
wherever
there
are
large
construction
works
railroads
canals
or
aqueducts
look
for
bird
slaughter
and
you
are
sure
to
find
it
the
exception
to
this
rule
so
far
as
i
know
is
along
the
line
of
the
new
catskill
aqueduct
coming
to
new
york
city
the
contractors
have
elected
not
to
permit
bird
slaughter
and
the
rule
has
been
made
that
any
man
who
goes
out
hunting
will
instantly
be
discharged
that
is
the
best
rule
that
ever
was
made
for
the
protection
of
birds
and
game
against
aliens
let
every
state
and
province
in
america
look
out
sharply
for
the
foreigner
for
sooner
or
later
he
will
surely
attack
your
wild
life
the
italians
are
spreading
spreading
spreading
if
you
are
without
them
they
will
be
around
you
meet
them
at
the
threshold
with
drastic
laws
throughly
enforced
for
no
half
way
measures
will
answer
pennsylvania
has
had
the
worst
experience
of
alien
slaughterers
of
any
state
thus
far
of
her
game
wardens
have
been
and
eight
or
ten
have
been
wounded
by
shooting
finally
her
legislature
arose
in
wrath
and
passed
a
law
prohibiting
the
ownership
or
possession
of
guns
of
any
kind
by
aliens
the
law
gives
the
right
of
domiciliary
search
and
it
surely
is
enforced
of
course
the
foreign
population
kicked
against
the
law
but
the
people
steam
roller
went
over
them
just
the
same
in
new
york
we
require
from
an
alien
a
license
costing
and
it
has
saved
a
million
perhaps
of
our
birds
but
the
pennsylvania
law
is
the
best
it
may
be
taken
as
a
model
for
every
state
and
province
in
america
its

other
sections
provide
for
the
full
enforcement
of
this
law
it
is
now
high
time
and
an
imperative
public
necessity
that
every
state
should
act
in
this
matter
before
its
bird
life
is
suddenly
attacked
and
serious
inroads
made
upon
it
do
it
now
the
enemy
is
headed
your
way
do
wait
for
him
to
strike
the
first
blow
of
the
italian
press
and
now
what
is
the
best
remedy
for
the
troubles
that
will
arise
for
italians
in
america
because
of
wrong
principles
established
in
italy
it
is
not
in
the
law
the
police
the
court
and
the
punishment
it
is
in
the
italian
into
a
knowledge
of
the
duties
of
the
good
the
italian
press
and
clergy
can
do
this
and
one
else
can
do
it
so
easily
so
quickly
and
so
those
two
powerful
forces
should
enter
seriously
upon
this
task
in
every
other
respect
the
naturalized
italian
tries
to
become
a
good
citizen
and
adjust
himself
to
the
laws
and
the
customs
of
his
new
country
why
should
he
not
do
this
in
regard
to
bird
life
it
is
not
too
much
to
ask
nor
is
it
too
much
to
does
the
italian
workman
or
who
makes
his
living
by
honest
toil
breaking
our
bird
laws
irritating
and
injuring
those
with
whom
he
has
come
to
live
does
he
being
watched
and
searched
and
chased
and
arrested
all
for
a
few
small
birds
that
he
not
for
food
he
earns
good
wages
he
has
plenty
of
good
food
and
he
must
be
into
protecting
our
birds
instead
of
destroying
them
the
italian
newspapers
and
clergy
have
a
serious
duty
to
perform
in
this
matter
and
we
hope
they
will
diligently
discharge
it
illustration
dead
these
jars

the

of
valuable
insectivorous

that
were

chapter
xii
destruction
of
song
birds
by
southern
negroes
and
poor
whites
before
going
farther
there
is
one
point
that
i
wish
to
make
quite
clear
whenever
the
people
of
a
particular
race
make
a
specialty
of
some
particular
type
of
anyone
who
pointedly
rebukes
the
faulty
members
of
that
race
is
immediately
accused
of
race
prejudice
on
account
of
the
facts
i
am
now
setting
forth
about
the
doings
of
italian
and
negro
i
expect
to
be
accused
along
that
line
if
i
am
i
shall
strenuously
deny
the
charge
the
facts
speak
for
themselves
zoologically
however
i
am
strongly
prejudiced
against
the
people
of
any
race
creed
club
state
or
nation
who
make
a
specialty
of
any
particularly
offensive
type
of
bird
or
wild
animal
slaughter
and
i
do
not
care
who
knows
it
the
time
was
and
i
remember
it
very
well
when
even
the
poorest
gunner
scorned
to
kill
birds
that
were
not
considered
game
in
days
lang
syne
many
a
zoological
collector
has
been
jeered
because
the
specimens
he
had
killed
for
preservation
were
not
game
but
times
have
changed
in
the
wearing
of
furs
we
have
bumped
down
steps
both
high
and
steep
in
american
women
wore
sealskin
marten
otter
beaver
and
mink
nothing
that
wears
hair
is
too
humble
to
be
skinned
and
worn
they
are
wearing
skins
of
muskrats
foxes
rabbits
skunks
domestic
cats
squirrels
and
even
rats
and
see
how
the
taste
for
game
of
some
sections
of
our
population
also
has
gone
down
in
the
north
the
italians
are
fighting
for
the
privilege
of
eating
everything
that
wears
feathers
but
we
allow
no
birds
to
be
shot
for
food
save
game
birds
and
cranes
in
the
south
the
negroes
and
poor
whites
are
killing
woodpeckers
and
doves
for
food
and
in
several
states
some
of
it
is
done
under
the
authority
of
the
laws

the
killing
of
doves
represents
a
great
and
widespread
decline
in
the
ethics
of
sportsmanship
in
the
states
named
a
great
many
men
who
themselves
sportsmen
indulge
in
the
cheap
and
ignoble
pastime
of
potting
weak
and
confiding
doves
it
is
on
a
par
with
the
sport
of
hunting
english
sparrows
in
a
city
street
of
course
this
is
to
a
certain
extent
a
matter
of
taste
but
there
is
at
least
one
club
of
sportsmen
into
which
no
can
enter
provided
his
standard
of
ethics
is
known
in
advance
with
the
killing
of
robins
larks
blackbirds
and
cedar
birds
for
food
the
case
is
quite
different
no
white
man
calling
himself
a
sportsman
ever
indulges
in
such
low
pastimes
as
the
killing
of
such
birds
for
food
that
burden
of
disgrace
rests
upon
the
negroes
and
poor
whites
of
the
south
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
a
shame
that
respectable
white
men
sitting
in
state
legislatures
should
deliberately
enact
laws
such
disgraceful
practices
or
permit
such
disgraceful
and
ungentlemanly
laws
to
remain
in
force
here
is
a
case
by
way
of
illustration
copied
very
recently
from
the
atlanta
editor
i
located
a
robin
roost
up
the
trinity
river
six
miles
from
dallas
and
prevailed
on
six
dallas
sportsmen
to
go
with
me
on
a
bird
hunt
this
style
of
hunting
was
of
course
new
to
the
texans
but
they
finally
consented
to
go
and
i
had
the
pleasure
of
showing
them
how
it
was
done
equipped
with
torch
lights
and
shot
guns
we
proceeded
after
reaching
the
hunting
grounds
the
sport
began
in
reality
and
continued
for
two
hours
and
ten
minutes
with
a
total
slaughter
of
birds
an
average
of
birds
killed
by
each
man
but
the
texans
give
me
credit
for
killing
at
least
of
the
entire
number
i
was
called
king
of
bird
hunters
by
the
sportsmen
of
dallas
texas
and
have
been
invited
to
the
next
party
of
hunters
which
go
from
dallas
to
the
indian
territory
in
search
of
large
crow
dallas
texas
former
atlantan

texas
papers
and
oklahoma
papers
please
copy
as
a
further
illustration
of
the
spirit
manifested
in
the
south
toward
robins
i
quote
the
following
story
from
claxton
of
the
university
of
tennessee
as
related
in
audubon
educational
leaflet
no
by
gilbert
pearson
the
roost
to
which
i
refer
says
professor
claxton
was
situated
in
what
is
locally
known
as
a
glade
near
porestville
bedford
tennessee
this
is
a
great
cedar
country
and
robins
used

a

who
recently
had

chanced
to
remark
to
me
at
our
country
home
in
the
middle
of
august
i
wish
i
could
find
some
birds
nests
what
for
i
asked
rather
puzzled
why
to
get
the

and
she
responded
with
a
bright
smile
and
flashing
teeth
do
you
eat
the
eggs
of
birds
yes
indeed
it
to
get
a
pattridge
nest
from
them
we
nearly
always
git
a
whole
dozen
of
aigs
at
once
back
where
i
live
in

do
the
colored
people
of
virginia
make
a
of
hunting
for
the
eggs
of
wild
birds
and
eating
them
yes
indeed
we
do
in
the
spring
and
summer
when
the
birds
are
around
we
used
to
get
out
every
sunday
and
hunt
all
day
some
days
we
come
back
with
a
whole
bucket
full
of
aigs

then
we
set
up
half
the
night
cookin
and
eatin
they
was
good
her
face
fairly
beamed
at
the
memory
of
it
a
few
days
later
this
story
of
the
doings
of
virginia
negroes
was
fully
corroborated
by
a
colored
man
who
came
from
another
section
of
that
state
three
months
later
after
special
inquiries
made
at
my
request
a
gentleman
of
richmond
obtained
further
corroboration
from
negroes
he
was
himself
much
surprised
by
the
state
of
fact
that
was
revealed
to
him
in
the
north
the
economic
value
of
our
song
birds
and
other
destroyers
of
insects
and
weed
seeds
is
understood
by
a
majority
of
the
people
and
as
far
as
possible
those
birds
are
protected
from
all
human
enemies
but
in
the
south
a
new
division
of
the
army
of
destruction
has
risen
into
deadly
prominence
in
magazine
for
may
charles
askins
published
a
most
startling
and
illuminating
article
entitled
the
south
problem
in
game
protection
it
brought
together
in
concrete
form
and
with
reliability
the
impressions
that
for
months
previous
had
been
gaining
ground
in
the
north
in
order
to
give
the
testimony
of
a
man
who
has
seen
what
he
describes
i
shall
now
give
numerous
quotations
from
askins
article
which
certainly
bears
the
stamp
of
truthfulness
without
any
race
prejudice
whatever
it
is
a
calm
judicial
unemotional
analysis
of
a
very
bad
situation
and
i
particularly
commend
it
alike
to
the
farmers
of
the
north
and
all
the
true
sportsmen
of
the
south
in
his
opening
paragraphs
askins
describes
game
and
hunting
conditions
in
the
south
as
they
were
down
to
twenty
years
ago
when
the
negroes
were
too
poor
to
own
guns
and
shooting
was
not
for
them
special
work
of
the
southern
negroes
it
is
all
different
now
says
askins
and
the
old
days
will
only
come
back
with
the
water
that
has
gone
down
the
stream
the
master
is
with
his
fathers
or
he
is
whiling
away
his
last
days
on
the
courthouse
steps
of
the
town
perhaps
a
chimney
or
two
remain
of
what
was
once
the
big
house
on
the
hill
possibly
it
is
still
standing
but
as
forlorn
and
lifeless
as
a
dead
tree
the
muscadine
grapes
still
grow
in
the
swale
and
the
persimmons
in
the
pasture
field
but
neither
nor
is
left
to
eat
them
the
last

the

uncle
ike
has
gone
across
the
great
river
with
his
master
and
his
grandson
glances
at
you
askance
nods
sullenly
whistles
to
his
half
breed
bird
dog
shoulders
his
three
dollar
gun
and
leaves
you
he
is
typical
of
the
change
and
has
caused
it
this
grandson
of
dear
old
uncle
ike
in
the
same
way
the
white
man
is
telling
the
black
to
abide
upon
the
plantation
raising
cotton
and
corn
and
further
than
this
nothing
will
be
required
of
him
he
can
cheat
a
white
man
or
a
black
steal
in
a
petty
way
anything
that
comes
handy
live
in
marriage
or
out
of
it
to
please
himself
kill
another
negro
if
he
likes
and
lastly
shoot
every
wild
thing
that
can
be
eaten
if
only
he
raises
the
cotton
and
the
corn
but
the
white
sportsmen
of
the
south
have
never
willingly
granted
the
shooting
privilege
in
its
entirety
and
hence
this
story
they
have
told
him
to
trap
the
rabbits
pot
the
robins
slaughter
the
doves
kill
the
song
birds
but
to
spare
the
white
sportsman
game
the
aristocratic
little
bobwhite
quail
in
the
beginning
not
so
much
damage
to
southern
game
interests
could
be
accomplished
by
our
colored
man
and
brother
however
decided
his
inclinations
he
had
no
money
no
ammunition
and
no
gun
his
weapons
were
an
ax
a
club
a
trap
and
a
hound
dog
possibly
he
might
own
an
old
war
musket
bored
out
for
shot
such
an
outfit
was
not
adapted
to
quail
shooting
and
especially
to
wing
shooting
with
which
knowledge
dixie
sportsmen
were
content
let
the
negro
ramble
about
with
his
hound
dog
and
his
war
musket
he
could
possibly
kill
the
quail
and
so
uncle
ike
grandson
loafed
and
pottered
about
in
the
fields
with
his
ax
and
his
hound
dogs
not
doing
so
much
harm
to
the
quail
but
acquiring
knowledge
of
the
habits
of
the
birds
and
skill
as
a
that
would
serve
him
well
later
on
the
negro
belongs
to
a
primitive
race
of
people
and
all
such
races
have
keener
eyes
than
white
men
whose
fathers
have
pored
over
lines
of
black
and
white
he
learned
to
see
the
rabbit
in
its
form
the
squirrels
in
the
leafy
trees
and
the
quails
huddled
in
the
grass
the
least
shade
of
gray
in
the
shadow
of
the
creek
bank
he
distinguished
at
once
as
a
rabbit
a
glinting
flash
from
a
tree
top
he
knew
instantly
as
being
caused
by
the
slight
movement
of
a
hidden
squirrel
and
the
quiver
of
a
single
stem
of
sedge
grass
told
him
of
a
bevy
of
birds
hiding
in
the
depths
the
negro
has
all
the
skill
of
the
indian
has
more
industry
in
his
loafing
and
kills
without
pity
and
without
restraint
this
grandson
of
uncle
ike
was
growing
sulky
too
with
the
knowledge
that
the
white
man
was
bribing
him
with
half
a
loaf
to
raise
cotton
and
corn
when
he
might
as
well
exact
it
all
and
this
he
shortly
did
as
we
shall
see
the
time
came
when
cotton
went
up
to
sixteen
cents
a
pound
and
single
guns
went
down
to
five
dollars
apiece
the
negro
had
money
now
and
the
merchants
these
men
who
had
said
let
the
nigger
alone
so
long
as
he
raises
cotton
and
corn
sold
him
the
guns
a
gun
for
every
black
idler
man
and
boy
in
all
the
south
then
shortly
a
wail
went
up
from
the
sportsmen
the
niggers
are
killing
our
quail
they
not
only
were
killing
them
but
most
of
the
birds
were
already
dead
on
the
grounds
of
the
southern
field
club
where
sixty
bevies
were
raised
by
the
dogs
in
one
day
within
two
years
but
three
bevies
could
be
found
in
a
day
by
the
hardest
kind
of
hunting
and
this
story
was
repeated
all
over
the
south
now
the
negro
began
to
raise
bird
dogs
in
place
of
hounds
and
he
carried
his
new
gun
to
church
if
services
happened
to
be
held
on
a
week
day
finally
the
negro
had
grown
up
and
had
compassed
his
ambition
he
could
shoot
partridges
flying
just
the
same
as
a
white
man
was
a
white
man
except
for
a
trifling
difference
in
color
and
he
could
kill
more
birds
too
three
times
as
many
it
was
merely
a
change
from
the
old
order
to
the
new
in
which
a
sportsman
had
taken
the
place
in
plantation
life
of
the
dear
old
colonel
of
loved
memory
the
negro
had
exacted
his
price
for
raising
cotton
and
corn

collect

in
a

with
every
man
his

spread
out
over
the
fields

he
has

a

will
draw

shots
and
perhaps
a

of
young

will
pour
loads
into
a
bunny
after
he
is
dead
out
of
pure
deviltry
and
high
spirits
i
once
witnessed
the
accidental
killing
of
a
young
negro
on
this
kind
of
a
foray
his
companions
loaded
him
into
a
wagon
stuck
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
and
tried
to
pour
whiskey
down
him
every
time
they
took
a
drink
themselves
as
they
rode
back
to
town
this
army
of
black
hunters
and
their
dogs
cross
field
after
field
combing
the
country
with
fine
teeth
that
leave
neither
wild
animal
nor
bird
life
behind
there
comes
a
time
toward
the
spring
of
the
year
after
the
quail
season
is
over
when
the
average
rural
darky
is
between
hay
and
grass
the
merchants
on
whom
he
has
depended
for
supplies
make
it
a
practice
to
refuse
credit
between
january
first
and
crop
time
the
black
has
spent
his
cotton
money
his
sweet
potato
pile
has
vanished
the
sorghum
barrel
is
empty
he
has
eaten
the
last
of
his
winter
pork
and
all
that
remains
is
a
bit
of
meal
and
the
meat
his
gun
can
secure
he
is
hunting
in
grim
earnest
now
using
all
the
cunning
and
skill
acquired
by
years
of
practice
he
eats
woodpeckers
jaybirds
hawks
and
skunks
drawing
the
line
only
at
crows
and
buzzards
at
this
season
of
the
year
i
have
carried
chicken
hawks
up
to
the
cabins
for
the
sake
of
watching
the
delight
of
the
piccaninnies
who
with
glowing
eyes
would
declare
mos
as
good
as
chicken
what
happens
to
the
robins
doves
larks
red
birds
mocking
birds
and
all
songsters
in
this
hungry
season
needs
hardly
to
be
stated
it
is
also
a
time
between
hay
and
grass
for
the
rabbits
and
the
quail
the
corn
fields
are
bare
and
the
weed
seeds
are
exhausted
a
spring
cold
spell
pinches
they
lose
their
vitality
become
thin
and
quite
lack
their
ordinary
wariness
then
the
trap
springs
up
in
the
hedgerow
and
the
sedge
while
the
work
of
decimation
goes
more
rapidly
along
the
rabbits
can
no
longer
escape
the
dogs
the
thinning
cover
fails
to
hide
the
quail
and
the
song
birds
betray
themselves
by
singing
of
the
coming
spring
with
the
growing
scarcity
of
the
game
now
comes
the
season
of
sedge
and
field
burning
this
is
done
ostensibly
to
prepare
the
land
for
spring
plowing
but
really
to
destroy
the
last
refuge
of
the
quail
and
rabbits
so
that
they
can
be
bagged
with
certainty
all
the
negroes
of
a
neighborhood
collect
for
one
of
these
burnings
all
their
dogs
and
of
course
all
the
boys
from
six
years
old
up
they
surround
the
field
and
set
it
on
fire
in
many
places
leaving
small
openings
for
the
game
to
dash
out
among
the
motley
assembly
i
have
seen
quail
fly
out
of
the
burning
grass
with
flaming
particles
still
attached
to
them
they
alight
on
the
burnt
ground
too
bewildered
to
fly
again
and
the
boys
and
dogs
pick
them
up
crazed
rabbits
try
the
gauntlet
amidst
the
barking
curs
shouting
negroes
and
popping
guns
but
death
is
sure
and
quick
the
few
quail
that
may
escape
have
no
refuge
from
the
hawks
and
nothing
to
eat
so
every
battue
of
this
kind
marks
the
absolute
end
of
the
birds
in
one
vicinity
and
the
next
day
the
darkies
repeat
the
performance
elsewhere
at
this
season
of
the
year
the
first
of
may
the
blacks
are
putting
in
some
of
their
one
hundred
working
days
while
the
single
rusts
in
the
chimney
corner
surely
the
few
birds
that
have
escaped
the
foray
of
the
gang
lived
through
the
hungry
days
and
survived
their
burned
homes
can
now
call
bob
white
and
mate
in
peace
but
school
is
out
and
the
summer
sun
is
putting
new
life
into
the
bare
feet
of
the
boys
and
the
halfbreed
bird
dogs
are
busier
than
they
were
even
in
winter
the
young
rabbits
are
killed
before
they
get
out
of
the
nest
and
the
quail
eggs
must
be
hidden
rarely
well
that
escape
both
the
eyes
of
the
boys
and
the
noses
of
the
dogs
after
all
it
is
not
surprising
that
but
three
bevies
remained
of
the
sixty
doubtless
they
would
not
except
that
nature
is
very
kind
to
her
own
in
the
sunny
south
not
every
white
man
in
the
south
is
a
sportsman
or
even
a
shooter
many
are
purely
business
men
who
have
said
let
the
nigger
do
as
he
likes
so
long
as
he
raises
cotton
and
buys
our
goods
but
dixie
has
her
full
share
of
true
men
of
the
and
they
have
sworn
in
downright
southern
fashion
that
this
thing
has
got
to
end
nevertheless
their
problem
is
deep
and
puzzling
in
alabama
they
made
an
effort
and
a
beginning
they
asked
for
a
law
requiring
every
man
to
obtain
written
permission
before
entering
the
lands
of
another
to
hunt
and
shoot
they
asked
for
a
resident
license
law
taxing
every
gun
not
less
than
five
dollars
a
year
for
a
shortened
season
a
bag
limit
and
a
complete
system
of
state
wardens
unfortunately
a
lot
of
white
farmers
were
in
the
same
range
as
the
blacks
and
being
hit
too
they
raised
a
great
outcry
the
result
was
that
the
alabama
sportsmen
got
everything
they
asked
for
except
the
foundation
of
the
structure
they
were
trying
to
build
the
high
resident
license
or
gun
tax
which
alone
could
have
shut
out
three
dollar
guns
and
saved
the
remnant
of
the
game
under
the
new
law
the
sale
of
game
was
forbidden
neither
could
it
be
shipped
out
of
the
state
alive
or
dead
the
ever
popular
license
was
provided
for
the
season
was
shortened
and
the
bag
limited
the
office
of
state
game
warden
was
created
with
deputies
to
be
paid
from
fines
hunting
upon
the
lands
of
another
without
written
permission
became
a
misdemeanor
and
then
the
whole
thing
was
nullified
by
reducing
the
resident
license
to
nothing
where
a
man
shot
upon
his
own
land
one
dollar
in
his
own
county
and
two
dollars
outside
of
it
in
its
practical
workings
the
new
law
amounts
to
this
a
few
northern
gunners
have
paid
the
license
fee
and
enough
resident
licenses
have
been
taken
out
by
the
city
sportsmen
to
make
up
the
handsome
salary
of
the
state
warden
the
negro
still
hunts
upon
his
own
land
upon
the
land
of
the
man
who
wants
corn
and
cotton
with
perfect
indifference
to
the
whole
thing
who
was
to
enforce
the
law
against
him
not
the
one
disgusted
deputy
with
three
big
counties
to
patrol
who
depended
for
his
salary
upon
the
fines
collected
from
the
negroes
it
would
take
one
man
to
every
three
miles
square
to
protect
the
game
in
the
south
the
one
effective
way
of
dealing
with
the
situation
in
alabama
was
to
have
legislated
three
dollar
guns
out
of
existence
with
a
five
dollar
tax
adding
to
this
nearly
a
like
amount
on
dogs
hardly
a
sportsman
in
the
south
will
disagree
with
this
conclusion
but
sportsmen
never
had
a
majority
vote
either
in
the
south
or
in
the
north
and
the
south
grave
problem
is
yet
unsolved
i
do
not
favor
depriving
the
black
man
of
his
natural
human
right
to
hunt
and
shoot
if
he
is
the
owner
of
land
or
if
he
leases
or
rents
it
or
if
he
does
not
he
should
have
exactly
the
same
privilege
of
hunting
that
the
white
man
has
that
is
not
the
question
now
however
but
how
to
restrict
him
to
legal
shooting
to
make
him
amenable
to
the
law
that
governs
the
white
man
to
deprive
him
of
the
absolute
license
he
now
enjoys
to
kill
throughout
the
year
without
mercy
without
discrimination
without
restraint
if
only
for
selfish
reasons
we
of
the
north
should
reach
to
southern
sportsmen
a
helping
hand
for
by
and
by
the
last
of
our
migratory
song
birds
will
go
down
into
dixie
and
never
return
askins
has
fairly
stated
a
profoundly
disturbing
case
the
remedy
must
contain
at
least
three
ingredients
the
sportsmen
of
the
south
must
stop
the
unjustifiable
slaughter
of
their
game
birds
as
a
matter
of
comity
between
states
the
gentlemen
of
the
south
must
pass
laws
to
stop
the
killing
of
northern
and
all
birds
for
food
finally
all
men
north
and
south
east
and
west
must
unite
in
the
work
that
is
necessary
to
secure
the
immediate
enactment
by
congress
of
a
law
for
the
federal
protection
of
all
migratory
birds

in
the

i
have
had
much
valuable
assistance
from
william
beebe
who
recently
has
probed
the
london
feather
trade
almost
to
the
bottom
it
is
high
time
for
the
whole
civilized
world
to
know
that
many
of
the
most
beautiful
and
remarkable
birds
of
the
world
are
now
being
to
furnish
millinery
ornaments
for
women
wear
the
mass
of
new
information
that
we
have
recently
secured
on
this
traffic
from
the
headquarters
of
the
feather
trade
is
appalling
previously
i
had
not
dreamed
that
conditions
are
half
as
bad
as
they
are
it
is
entirely
fitting
that
on
this
subject
new
york
should
send
a
message
to
london
new
york
is
almost
a
spotless
town
in
millinery
and
london
and
paris
are
the
worst
places
in
the
world
we
have
cleaned
house
with
but
extremely
slight
exceptions
the
blood
of
the
slaughtered
innocents
is
no
longer
upon
our
skirts
and
on
the
subject
of
plumage
millinery
we
have
a
right
to
be
just
as
pharisaical
as
we
choose
here
in
new
york
and
also
in
new
jersey
no
man
may
sell
own
for
sale
or
offer
for
sale
the
plumage
of
any
wild
american
bird
other
than
a
game

than
that
the
plumage
of
no
foreign
bird
belonging
to
any
bird
family
represented
in
the
fauna
of
north
america
can
be
sold
here
there
are
only
a
few
kinds
of
improper
millinery
feathers
that
it
is
possible
to
sell
here
under
the
law
thanks
to
the
long
and
arduous
campaign
of
the
national
association
of
audubon
societies
founded
and
for
ten
years
directed
by
gallant
william
dutcher
you
now
see
on
the
streets
of
new
york
very
very
little
plumage

that
from
game
birds
it
is
true
that
a
few
servant
girls
are
now
wearing
the
aigrettes
of
their
mistresses
but
they
are
only
as
one
in
a
thousand
at
atlantic
city
there
is
said
to
be
a
fine
display
of
and
aigrettes
in
new

and
new

in
pennsylvania
for
everything
save
the
sale
of
heron
and
egret
plumes
a
privilege
obtained
by
a
bunko
game
in
massachusetts
and
in
many
other
of
our
states
the
millinery
business
is
dead
two
years
ago
when
the
new
york
legislature
refused
to
repeal
the
dutcher
law
the
millinery
association
asserted
and
brought
a
cloud
of
witnesses
to
albany
to
prove
that
the
enforcement
of
the
law
would
throw
thousands
of
operatives
out

no

the

bird

is
now

their

here
is
possible

law
protects
from
the

dealers
only
the
birds
that
belong
to
avian
families
represented
in

with
fiendish
cunning

the

are
ferreting
out
the
birds
whose
skins

may
legally
be
imported
into

country
and

but
we
will
meet
that
with
a
law
that
will
protect
all
foreign
birds
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
now
it

for
the
universal
enactment
of

feathers

london
is
now
the
head
of
the
giant
octopus
of
the
feather
trade
that
has
reached
out
its
deadly
tentacles
into
the
most
remote
wildernesses
of
the
earth
and
steadily
is
drawing
in
the
skins
and
plumes
and

of
the
most
beautiful

interesting
birds
of

the
extent
of
this
industry
supported
by

and
women

presently
be
shown
in

paris
is
the
great
manufacturing
center
of
feather
trimming

ornaments
and
the
french
people
obstinately
refuse
to
protect
the
birds
from
extermination
because
their
slaughter
affords
employment
to
a
certain
numbers
of
french
factory
operatives
all
over
the
world
where
they
have
real
estate
possessions
the
men
of
england
know
how
to
protect
game
from

the
english
are
good
at
protecting
game
when
they
decide
to
set
about
it
why
should
london
be
the
mecca
of
the
of
the
world
it
is
easily
explained
london
has
the
greatest
feather
market
in
the
world
the
feather
industry
wants
the
money
and
the
london
feather
industry
is
willing
to
spend
money
in
fighting
to
retain
its
on
the
unprotected
birds
of

let
us
run
through
a
small
portion
of
the
mass
of
fresh
evidence
before
us
it
will
be
easier
for
the
friends
of
birds
to
read
these
details
here
than
to
procure
them
at
first
hand
as
we
have
done
the
first
thing
that
strikes
one
is
the
fact
that
the
are
scattered
over
the
world
where
bird
life
is
and
there
are
no
laws
to
hinder
their
work
i
commend

every
friend
of
birds
this
list
of
the
species
whose
plumage
is
being
bought
and
sold

large
quantities
every

this
list
is
of
deadly
import

the
reader
will
notice
that
it

the
way
of

out

the
report
of
an
agent
whom
i
engaged
to
ascertain
the
london
dealings
in
the
plumage
of
wild
birds
that
were
killed
especially
to
furnish
that
plumage
as
one
item
let
us
take
the
sales
in
london
in
february
may
and
october
because
they
bring
the
subject
well
down
to
date
my
agent
explanatory
note
is
as
follows
these
three
sales
represent
six
months
very
nearly
double
this
quantity
is
sold
by
these
four
firms
in
a
year
we
must
also
take
into
consideration
that
all
the
feathers
are
not
brought
to
the
london
market
and
that
large
shipments
are
also
made
direct
to
the
dealers
and
manufacturers
of
paris
and
berlin
and
that
amsterdam
also
gets
large
quantities
from
the
west
for
your
purpose
i
report
upon
three
sales
at
different
periods
of
the
year
and
as
those
sales
do
not
vary
much
you
will
be
able
to
judge
the
consumption
of
birds
in
a
year
the
aigrettes
of
the
feather
trade
come
from
egrets
and
being
very
light
it
requires
the
death
of
several
birds
to
yield
one
ounce
in
many
catalogues
the
word
albatross
stands
for
the
jabiru
a
species
of
giant
stork
inhabiting
south
america
rhea
often
stands
for
vulture
plumage
if
the
feather
dealers
had
deliberately
attempted
to
form
an
educational
list
of
the
most
beautiful
and
the
most
interesting
birds
of
the
world
they
could
hardly
have
done
better
than
they
have
done
in
the
above
list
if
it
were
in
my
power
to
show
the
reader
a
colored
plate
of
each
species
now
being
exterminated
by
the
feather
trade
he
would
be
startled
by
the
exhibit
that
the
very
choicest
birds
of
the
whole
avian
world
should
be
thus
blotted
out
at
the
behest
of
vain
and
heartless
women
is
a
shame
a
disgrace

loss

many

are

slaughter

it
will
be
noticed
that
the
breast
of
the
grebe
has
almost
wholly
disappeared
from
the
feather
market
and
from
women
hats
the
reason
is
that
there
are
no
longer
enough
birds
of
that
group
to
hold
a
place
in
the
london
market
few
indeed
are
the
americans
who
know
that
from
to
the
lake
region
of
southern
oregon
was
the
scene
of
the
slaughter
of
uncountable
thousands
of
those
birds
which
continued
until
the
grebes
were
almost
exterminated
when
the
wonderful
of
australia
had
been
almost
exterminated
for
its
tail
feathers
its
open
slaughter
was
stopped
by
law
and
a
heavy
fine
was
imposed
on
exportation
amounting
i
have
been
told
to
for
each
offense
my
latest
news
of
the
was
of
the
surreptitious
exportation
of
skins
to
the
london
feather
market
in
india
the
smuggling
outward
of
the
skins
of
protected
birds
is
constantly
going
on
occasionally
an
exporter
is
caught
and
fined
but
that
does
not
stop
the
traffic
must
now
bid
farewell
forever
to
all
the
birds
of
paradise
nothing
but
the
legal
closing
of
the
world
markets
against
their
plumes
and
skins
can
save
any
of
them
they
never
were
numerous
nor
does
any
species
range
over
a
wide
area
they
are
strictly
insular
and
the
island
homes
of
some
of
them
are
very
small
take
the
great
bird
of
paradise
as
an
illustration

city
near
the
center
of

of

of
the
fourth
national

congress
i
counted
stuffed
heads
and
complete
sets
of
plumes
of
this
bird
displayed
for

the
prices
ranged
from
to
each
and
while
i
looked
a
large
lady
approached
pointed
her
finger
at
the
remains
of
a
greater
bird
of

with
grim
determination
said
to

i

miles

haunts
of

of

without
seeing
or
hearing
even
the
commonest
species
when
i
reflect
on
this
sacrilege
i
am
lost
in
wonder
at
the
apathy
of
the
british
public
carl
hagenbeck
wrote
me
only
three
months
ago
that
the
condors
of
the
andes
are
all
being
exterminated
for
their
feathers
and
these
birds
are
now
very
difficult
to
obtain
the
egret
and
heron
plumes
known
under
the
trade
name
of
osprey
feathers
form
by
far
the
most
important
item
in
each
feather
sale
there
are
grades
they
are
sold
by
the
ounce
and
the
prices
range
all
the
way
from
cents
per
ounce
for
mixed
heron
to
hundred
and
per
ounce
for
the
best
brazilian
short
selected
on

is
it
any
wonder
that
in
philadelphia
the
prices
of
finished
aigrettes
ready
to
be
worn
runs
from
to
the
plumes
that
run
up
into
the

the

now
with
these
enormous

is
it
any
wonder
that
the
egrets
and
herons
are
being
relentlessly
pursued
to
the
uttermost
ends
of
the
earth
i
think
that
any
man
who
really
knows
the
habits
of
egrets
and
herons
and
the
total
impossibility
of
any
quantity
of
their
shed
feathers
being
picked
up
in
a
marketable
state
must
know
in
his
heart
that
if
the
london

continental
feather
markets
keep
open
a
few
years
longer
that
furnishes
short
selected
plumes
will
be
utterly
exterminated
from
off
the
face
of

let
the
english
people
make
no
mistake
about
this
nor
be
fooled
by
any
fairy
tales
of
the
feather
trade
about
venezuelan
garceros
and
vast
quantities
of
valuable
plumes
picked
off
the
bushes
and
out
of
the
mud
those
carefully
concocted
stories
make
lovely
reading
but
the
reader
who
examines
the
evidence
will
soon
decide
the
extent
of
their
truthfulness
i
think
that
they
contain
not
even
ten
per
cent
of
truth
and
i
shall
not
rest
until
the
stories
of
leon
laglaize
and
mayeul
grisol
have
been
put
to
the
test
in
the
regions
where
they
originated
a
plumes
may
be
picked
out
of
the
jungle
yes
but
as
for
any
it
is
at
present
beyond
belief
besides
we
have
direct
testimony
to
the
contrary
it
must
not
be
inferred
that
the
friends
of
birds
in
england
have
been
idle
or
silent
in
the
presence
of
the
london
feather
trade
on
the
contrary
the
royal
society
for
the
protection
of
wild
birds
and
james
buckland
have
so
strongly
attacked
the
feather
industry
that
the
london
chamber
of
commerce
has
felt
called
upon
to
come
to
its
rescue
buckland
on
his
own
individual
account
has
done
yeoman
service
to
the
cause
and
his
devotion
to
the
birds
and
his
tireless
energy
are
both
almost
beyond
the
reach
of
praise
in
words
at
the
last
moment
before
going
to
press
i
learn
that
the
bill
has
achieved
the
triumph
of
a
first
reading
in
parliament
which
looks
as
if
success
is
at
last
in
sight
the
powerful
pamphlet
that
he
has
written
published
and
circulated
at
his
own
expense
entitled
pros
and
cons
of
the
plumage
bill
is
a
splendid
effort
what
a
pity
it
is
that
more
individuals
are
not
similarly
inspired
to
make
independent
effort
in
the
protection
cause
but
strange
to
say
few
indeed
are
the
men
who
have
either
the
nerve
or
the
ability
to
go
it
alone
on
the
introduction
in
parliament
of
the
bill
to
save
the
birds
from
the
feather
trade
it
was
opposed
through
the
efforts
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
on
the
ground
that
if
any
bill
against
the
sale
of
plumes
should
pass
and
plumes
could
not
be
sold
the
london
business
in
skins
and
feathers
would
immediately
be
transferred
to
the
continent
in
the
face
of
that
devastating
and
altogether
horrible
prospect
and
because
the
london
feather
dealers
need
the
money
the
bill
was
at
first
defeated
to
the
great
joy
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
and
downham
but
the
cause
of
birds
will
win
in
the
end
because
it
is
right
the
feather
dealers
have
been
shrewdly
active
in
the
defense
of
their
trade
and
the
methods
they
have
employed
for
influencing
public
opinion
have
quite
outshone
those
put
forth
by
their
brethren
in
america
i
have
before
me
a
copy
of
a
booklet
bearing
the
name
of
downham
as
the
author
and
the
london
chamber
of
commerce
has
loaned
its
good
name
as
publisher
altogether
it
is
a
very
shrewd
piece
of
work
even
though
its
arguments
in
justification
of
bird
slaughter
for
the
feather
market
are
too
absurd
and
weak
for
serious
consideration
the
chief
burden
of
the
defender
of
bird
slaughter
for
millinery
purposes
is
on
account
of
the
destruction
of
egrets
and
herons
but
particularly
the
former
to
offset
as
far
as
possible
the
absolutely
true
charge
that
egrets
bear
their
best
plumes
in
their
breeding
season
when
the
helpless
young
are
in
the
nest
and
the
parent
birds
must
be
killed
to
obtain
the
plumes
the
feather
trade
has
obtained
from
three
frenchmen
leon
laglaize
mayeul
grisol
and
geay
a
beautiful
and
plausible
story
to
the
effect
that
in
venezuela
the
enormous
output
of
egret
plumes
has
been
obtained
picking
up
off
the
bushes
and
out
of
the
water
and
mud
the
shed
feathers
of
those
birds
according
to
the
story
venezuela
is
full
of
called
garceros
where
the
birds
breed
and
moult
under
strict
supervision
and
kindly
drop
their
feathers
in
such
places
that
it
is
possible
find
and
to
them
in
a
high
state
of
preservation
and
we
are
asked
to
believe
that
it
is
these
very
venezuelan
feathers
that
command
in
london
the
high
price
of
per
illustration
the
fight
in
england
against
the
use
of
wild
plumage
in
the
millinery
trade
employed
by
the
royal
society
for
the
protection
of
birds
that
patroled
london
streets
in
july
laglaize
is
especially
exploited
by
downham
as
a
french
traveler
of
high
standing
and
well
known
in
the
zoological
museums
of
france
but
sad
to
say
when
henry
fairfield
osborn
cabled
to
the
museum
of
natural
history
in
paris
inquiring
about
laglaize
the
cable
flashed
back
the
one
sad
word
unknown
i
think
it
entirely
possible
that
enough
shed
feathers
have
been
picked
up
in
the
reeking
swamps
of
venezuela
on
the
upper
tributaries
of
the
orinoco
to
afford
for
the
beautiful
story
of
laglaize
any
shrewd
individual
with
money
and
the
influence
that
money
secures
could
put
up
just
such
a
plant
as
i
firmly
believe
been
put
up
by
some
one
in
venezuela
i
will
guarantee
that
i
could
accomplish
such
a
job
in
venezuela
or
brazil
in
four
months
time
at
an
expense
not
exceeding
one
thousand
dollars
that
the
great
supply
of
immaculately
perfect
egret
plumes
that
annually
come
out
of
venezuela
could
by
any
possibility
be
picked
up
in
the
swamps
where
they
were
shed
and
dropped
by
the
egrets
is
entirely
preposterous
and
incredible
the
whole
proportion
is
denounced
by
several
men
of
standing
and
experience
none
of
whom
are
as
a
sweeping
refutation
of
the
fantastic
statements
regarding
garceros
published
by
downham
as
coming
from
laglaize
grisol
and
geay
i
offer
the
written
testimony
of
an
american
gentleman
who
at
this
moment
owns
and
maintains
within
a
few
yards
of
his
residence
a
large
preserve
of
snowy
egrets
and
herons
the
former
representing
the
species
which
furnishes
egret
plumes
exactly
similar
to
those
shipped
from
venezuela
and
brazil
if
the
testimony
of
mcilhenny
is
not
sufficient
to
stamp
the
statements
of
the
three
frenchmen
quoted
by
downham
as
absolute
and
thoroughly
misleading
falsehoods
then
there
is
no
such
thing
in
this
world
as
evidence
i
suggest
a
perusal
of
the
statements
of
the
three
frenchmen
who
are
quoted
with
such
confidence
by
downham
and
published
by
the
hon
chamber
of
commerce
at
london
and
then
a
careful
reading
of
the
following
letter
avery
island
june
dear
hornaday
i
have
before
me
your
letter
of
june
asking
for
information
as
to
whether
or
no
egrets
shed
their
plumes
at
their
nesting
places
in
sufficient
quantities
to
enable
them
to
be
gathered
commercially
i
most
emphatically
wish
to
state
that
it
is
impossible
to
gather
at
the
nesting
places
of
these
birds
any
quantity
of
their
plumes
i
have
nesting
within
yards
of
where
i
am
now
sitting
dictating
this
letter
not
less
than
pairs
of
the
various
species
of
herons
and
egrets
and
there
are
fully
pairs
of
snowy
herons
nesting
within
my
preserve
during
the
nesting
season
which
covers
the
months
of
april
may
and
june
i
am
through
this
heronry
in
a
small
canoe
almost
every
day
and
often
twice
a
day
i
have
had
these
herons
under
my
close
inspection
for
the
past
years
and
i
have
not
in
any
one
season
picked
up
or
seen
more
than
half
a
dozen
discarded
plumes
such
plumes
as
i
have
picked
up
i
have
kept
on
my
desk
and
given
to
the
people
who
were
interested
i
remember
that
last
year
i
picked
up
four
plumes
of
the
snowy
heron
that
were
in
one
bunch
i
think
these
must
have
been
plucked
out
by
the
birds
fighting
this
year
i
have
found
only
one
plume
so
far
i
enclose
it
herewith
you
will
notice
that
it
is
one
of
the
shorter
plumes
and
is
badly
worn
at
the
end
as
have
been
all
the
plumes
which
i
have
picked
up
in
my
heronry
i
am
positive
that
it
is
not
possible
for
natural
shed
plumes
to
be
gathered
commercially
i
have
a
number
of
times
talked
with
plume
hunters
from
venezuela
and
other
south
american
countries
and
i
have
never
heard
of
any
egret
feathers
being
gathered
by
their
being
picked
up
after
the
birds
have
shed
them
i
have
heard
of
a
number
of
heronries
in
south
america
that
are
protected
by
the
land
owners
for
the
purpose
of
gathering
a
yearly
crop
of
egret
plumes
but
this
crop
is
gathered
always
by
shooting
a
certain
percentage
of
the
birds
this
shooting
is
done
by
experts
with
rifles
and
does
not
materially
disturb
the
nesting
colony
i
have
known
of
two
men
who
have
been
engaged
in
killing
the
birds
on
large
estates
in
south
america
who
were
paid
regular
salaries
for
their
services
as
egret
hunters
very
truly
yours
mcilhenny
i
am
more
than
willing
to
set
the
above
against
the
fairy
tale
of
laglaize
here
is
the
testimony
of
meyer
an
who
for
nine
years
worked
in
venezuela
his
sworn
testimony
was
laid
before
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
when
the
new
york
milliners
association
was
frantically
endeavoring
to
secure
the
repeal
of
the
splendid
dutcher
law
this
witness
was
produced
by
the
national
association
of
audubon
societies
my
attention
has
been
called
to
the
fact
that
certain
commercial
interests
in
this
city
are
circulating
stories
in
the
newspapers
and
elsewhere
to
the
effect
that
the
aigrettes
used
in
the
millinery
trade
come
chiefly
from
venezuela
where
they
are
gathered
from
the
ground
in
the
large
or
of
white
herons
i
wish
to
state
that
i
have
personally
engaged
in
the
work
of
collecting
the
plumes
of
these
birds
in
venezuela
this
was
my
business
for
the
years
to
inclusive
i
am
thoroughly
conversant
with
the
methods
employed
in
gathering
egret
and
snowy
heron
plumes
in
venezuela
and
i
wish
to
give
the
following
statement
regarding
the
practices
employed
in
procuring
these
feathers
the
birds
gather
in
large
colonies
to
rear
their
young
they
have
the
plumes
only
during
the
mating
and
nesting
season
after
the
period
when
they
are
employed
in
caring
for
their
young
it
is
found
that
the
plumes
are
virtually
of
no
commercial
value
because
of
the
worn
and
frayed
condition
to
which
they
have
been
reduced
it
is
the
custom
in
venezuela
to
shoot
the
birds
while
the
young
are
in
the
nests
a
few
feathers
of
the
large
white
heron
american
egret
known
as
the
can
be
picked
up
of
a
morning
about
their
breeding
places
but
these
are
of
small
value
and
are
known
as
dead
feathers
they
are
worth
locally
not
over
three
dollars
an
ounce
while
the
feathers
taken
from
the
bird
known
as
live
feathers
are
worth
fifteen
dollars
an
ounce
my
work
led
me
into
every
part
of
venezuela
and
colombia
where
these
birds
are
to
be
found
and
i
have
never
yet
found
or
heard
of
any
that
were
guarded
for
the
purpose
of
simply
gathering
the
feathers
from
the
ground
no
such
condition
exists
in
venezuela
the
story
is
absolutely
without
foundation
in
my
opinion
and
has
simply
been
put
forward
for
commercial
purposes
the
natives
of
the
country
who
do
virtually
all
of
the
hunting
for
feathers
are
not
provident
in
their
nature
and
their
practices
are
of
a
most
cruel
and
brutal
nature
i
have
seen
them
frequently
pull
the
plumes
from
wounded
birds
leaving
the
crippled
birds
to
die
of
starvation
unable
to
respond
to
the
cries
of
their
young
in
the
nests
above
which
were
calling
for
food
have
known
these
people
to
tie
and
prop
up
wounded
egrets
on
the
marsh
where
they
would
attract
the
attention
of
other
birds
flying
by
these
decoys
they
keep
in
this
position
until
they
die
of
their
wounds
or
from
the
attacks
of
insects
i
have
seen
the
terrible
red
ants
of
that
country
actually
eating
out
the
eyes
of
these
wounded
helpless
birds
that
were
tied
up
by
the
i
could
write
you
many
pages
of
the
horrors
practiced
in
gathering
aigrette
feathers
in
venezuela
by
the
natives
for
the
millinery
trade
of
paris
and
new
york
to
illustrate
the
comparatively
small
number
of
dead
feathers
which
are
collected
i
will
mention
that
in
one
year
i
and
my
associates
shipped
to
new
york
eighty
pounds
of
the
plumes
of
the
large
heron
and
twelve
pounds
of
the
little
recurved
plumes
of
the
snowy
heron
in
this
whole
lot
there
were
not
over
five
pounds
of
plumes
that
had
been
gathered
from
the
ground
and
these
were
of
little
value
the
have
been
nearly
exterminated
in
the
united
states
and
mexico
and
the
same
condition
of
affairs
will
soon
exist
in
tropical
america
this
extermination
will
come
about
because
of
the
fact
that
the
young
are
left
to
starve
in
the
nest
when
the
old
birds
are
killed
any
other
statement
made
by
interested
parties
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
i
am
so
incensed
at
the
ridiculously
absurd
and
misleading
stories
that
are
being
published
on
this
question
that
i
want
to
give
you
this
letter
and
before
delivering
it
to
you
shall
take
oath
to
its
truthfulness
here
is
the
testimony
of
caspar
whitney
of
new
york
formerly
editor
of
magazine
and
during
extended
travel
throughout
south
america
from
to
inclusive
i
journeyed
on
three
separate
occasions
by
canoe
on
the
lower
orinoco
and
apure
rivers
and
their
tributaries
this
is
the
region
so
far
as
venezuela
is
concerned
in
which
is
the
greatest
slaughter
of
white
herons
for
their
plumage
or
more
specifically
for
the
marital
plumes
which
are
carried
only
in
the
mating
and
breeding
season
and
are
known
in
the
millinery
trade
as
there
is
literally
no
room
for
question
the
snowy
herons
are
killed
exactly
as
i
describe
it
is
the
custom
of
all
those
who
hunt
for
the
millinery
trade
and
is
recognized
by
the
natives
as
the
usual
method
here
is
the
testimony
of
julian
dimock
of
peekamose
the
famous
outdoor
photographer
and
illustrator
of
florida
enchantments
i
know
a
goodly
number
of
the
of
florida
i
have
camped
with
them
and
talked
to
them
i
have
heard
their
tales
and
even
full
accounts
of
the
of
an
egret
rookery
never
has
a
man
in
florida
suggested
to
me
that
plumes
could
be
obtained
without
killing
the
birds
i
have
known
the
wardens
and
have
visited
rookeries
after
they
had
been
and
the
evidence
all
pointed
to
the
everlasting
use
of
the
gun
is
certainly
not
true
that
the
plumes
can
be
obtained
without
killing
the
birds
bearing
nineteen
years
ago
i
visited
the
cuthbert
rookery
with
one
of
the
men
who
discovered
the
birds
nesting
in
that
lake
he
and
his
partner
had
sold
the
plumes
gathered
there
for
more
than
a
thousand
dollars
he
showed
me
how
they
hid
in
the
bushes
and
shot
the
birds
he
even
gave
me
a
chance
to
watch
him
kill
two
or
three
birds
i
know
personally
the
man
chiefly
responsible
for
the
slaughter
of
the
birds
at
alligator
bay
laughed
at
the
idea
of
getting
plumes
without
killing
the
birds
i
well
know
the
man
who
shot
the
birds
up
rogers
river
and
even
saw
some
of
the
empty
shells
left
on

and
those
within
the

all
tell
the
same
story
birds
are
shot
to
get
the
the
evidence
of
my
own
eyes
and
the
action
of
the
birds
themselves
convinces
me
that
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
doubt
concerning
this
point
this
sworn
testimony
from
ashe
of
key
west
florida
is
very
direct
and
to
the
point
i
have
seen
many
moulted
and
dropped
feathers
from
wild
plumed
birds
i
have
never
seen
a
moulted
or
dropped
feather
that
was
fit
for
anything
it
is
the
exception
when
a
plumed
bird
drops
feathers
of
any
value
while
in
flight
whatever
feathers
are
so
dropped
are
those
that
are
frayed
worn
out
and
forced
out
by
the
process
of
moulting
the
moulting
season
is
not
during
the
hatching
season
but
is
after
the
hatching
season
the
shedding
or
moulting
takes
place
once
a
year
and
during
this
moulting
season
the
feathers
after
having
the
hard
usage
of
the
year
from
wind
rain
and
other
causes
when
dropped
are
of
absolutely
no
commercial
value
arthur
wayne
of
mount
pleasant
relates
in
sworn
testimony
his
experience
in
attempting
to
secure
egret
plumes
without
killing
the
birds
it
is
utterly
impossible
to
get
fifty
egret
plumes
from
any
colony
of
breeding
birds
without
shooting
the
birds
last
spring
i
went
twice
a
week
to
a
breeding
colony
of
american
and
snowy
egrets
from
early
in
april
until
june
despite
the
fact
that
i
covered
miles
of
territory
in
a
boat
i
picked
up
but
two
american
egret
plumes
which
i
now
have
but
not
a
single
snowy
egret
plume
did
i
see
nor
did
my
companion
who
accompanied
me
on
every
trip
i
saw
an
american
egret
plume
on
the
water
and
left
it
purposely
to
see
whether
it
would
sink
or
not
upon
visiting
the
place
a
few
days
afterwards
the
plume
was
not
in
evidence
undoubtedly
having
sunk
the
plumes
are
chiefly
shed
in
the
air
while
the
birds
are
going
to
or
coming
from
their
breeding
grounds
if
that
millinery
plume
law
is
repealed
the
fate
of
the
american
and
snowy
egrets
is
sealed
for
the
few
birds
that
remain
will
be
shot
to
the
very
last
one
any
man
who
ever
has
been
in
an
egret
rookery
and
i
have
knows
that
the
above
testimony
is
the
french
story
of
the
beautiful
and
egret
farms
in
venezuela
is
preposterous
save
for
a
mere
shadow
of
truth
i
do
not
say
that
egret
plumes
could
be
picked
up
but
i
do
assert
that
the
total
quantity
obtainable
in
one
year
in
that
way
would
be
utterly
trivial
no
the
ospreys
of
the
british
feather
market
come
from
slaughtered
egrets
and
herons
in
the
breeding
let
the
british
public
and
the
british
parliament
make
no
mistake
about
that
if
they
wish
the
trade
to
continue
let
it
be
based
on
the
impregnable
ground
that
the
merchants
want
the
money
and
not
on
a
fantastic
dream
that
is
too
silly
to
deceive
even
a
child
that
knows
birds
the
use
or
disuse
of
wild
birds
plumage
as
millinery
ornaments
is
another
of
those
subjects
regarding
which
there
is
no
room
for
argument
to
assert
that
the
want
the
business
for
the
money
it
brings
them
is
not
argument
we
have
seen
many
a
steam
roller
go
over
truth
and
right
and
justice
by
main
strength
and
power
but
truth
and
right
refuse
to
stay
flat
down
there
is
on
this
earth
not
one
species
mammal
bird
or
reptile
that
can
long
withstand
exploitation
for
commercial
purposes
even
the
whales
of
the
deep
sea
the
walrus
of
the
arctic
regions
the
condors
of
the
andes
and
alligators
of
the
everglade
morasses
are
no
exception
to
the
universal
rule
in
downham
book
there
is
much
fallacious
reasoning
and
many
conclusions
that
are
not
borne
out
by
the
facts
for
example
he
says
that
no
species
of
bird
of
paradise
has
been
diminished
in
number
by
slaughter
for
the
feather
trade
that
florida
still
contains
a
supply
of
egrets
that
the
decrease
in
bird
life
should
be
charged
to
the
spread
of
cities
towns
and
farms
and
not
to
the
trade
that
the
trade
was
in
no
way
responsible
for
the
slaughter
of
three
hundred
thousand
gulls
and
albatrosses
on
laysan
island
i
have
space
to
notice
one
other
important
erroneous
conclusion
that
downham
publishes
in
his
book
on
page
he
says
the
destruction
of
birds
in
foreign
countries
is
something
that
no
trade
can
direct
or
control
this
is
an
amazing
declaration
and
absolutely
contrary
to
experience
let
me
prove
what
i
say
by
a
fresh
and
incontestable
illustration
prior
to
april
when
governor
dix
signed
the
bayne
law
against
the
sale
of
wild
native
game
in
the
state
of
new
york
currituck
county
was
a
vast
for
wild
fowl
no
power
or
persuasion
had
availed
to
induce
the
people
of
north
carolina
to
check
or
regulate
or
in
any
manner
mitigate
that
slaughter
of
geese
ducks
and
swans
it
was
estimated
that
two
hundred
thousand
wild
fowl
were
annually
slaughtered
there
we
who
advocated
the
bayne
law
said
close
the
new
york
markets
against
currituck
birds
and
you
will
stop
a
great
deal
of
the
slaughter
we
cleaned
our
augean
stable
the
greatest
game
market
in
america
was
absolutely
closed
last
winter
the
annual
killing
of
wild
fowl
was
fully
fifty
per
cent
less
than
during
previous
years
in
one
small
town
twenty
professional
duck
shooters
went
entirely
out
of
business
because
they
sell
their
the
dealers
refused
to
buy
them
the
result
was
exactly
what
we
predicted
it
would
be
and
this
year
it
is
reported
over
and
over
that
ducks
are
more
plentiful
in
new
england
than
they
have
been
in
twenty
years
previously
the
result
is
wonderful
because
so
quick
beyond
all
question
the
feather
merchants
of
london
paris
and
berlin
absolutely
control
the
of
venezuela
china
new
guinea
mexico
and
south
america
let
the
word
go
forth
that
the
trade
is
no
longer
permitted
to
buy
and
sell
egret
and
heron
plumes
skins
of
birds
of
paradise
and
condor
feathers
and
presto
the
killing
industry
falls
dead
the
next
moment

miscellaneous
bird
skins

by
the
new
york
zoological
society
from
the
quarterly
sale
in
london
august
yes
indeed
members
of
the
british
parliament
it
is
easily
within
to
wipe
out
at
a
single
stroke
fully
of
the
bird
slaughter
for
fancy
feathers
it
can
be
done
just
as
we
wiped
out
the
annual
duck
slaughter
in
north
carolina
the
feather
trade
absolutely
control
the
killing
situation
now
will
the
people
of
england
clean
house
by
controlling
the
feather
trade
if
a
hundred
species
of
the
most
beautiful
birds
of
the
world
must
be
exterminated
for
the
feather
trade
let
the
odium
rest
elsewhere
than
on
the
people
of
england
the
of
america
may
rest
assured
that
the
of
england
a
mighty
host
are
neither
careless
nor
indifferent
regarding
the
plumage
business
on
the
contrary
several
bills
have
been
brought
before
parliament
intended
to
regulate
or
prohibit
the
traffic
and
a
measure
of
vast
importance
to
the
birds
of
the
world
is
now
before
the
house
of
commons
it
is
backed
by
percy
alden
by
the
royal
society
for
the
protection
of
birds
by
the
selbourne
society
and
by
james
buckland
a
host
in
himself
for
years
past
that
and
royal
society
has
waged
ceaseless
warfare
for
the
birds
its
activity
has
been
tremendous
and
its
membership
list
contains
many
of
the
finest
names
in
england
the
address
of
the
honorary
secretary
frank
lemon
is
queen
anne
gate
london
naturally
these
influences
are
opposed
by
the
textile
trade
section
of
the
london
chamber
of
commerce
and
their
only
argument
consists
of
the
plea
that
if
london
does
get
the
money
out
of
the
feather
trade
the
continent
will
get
it
a
reasonable
logical
magnificent
and
convincing
excuse
for
wholesale
bird
slaughter

buckland
has

the

unique

it
should
be
of

to

the
tragedy
occurred
on

about

the

and
barren
of
all
things
likely
to
enlist
the
attention
of
predatory
man
to
the
harassed
birds
of
it
seemed
like
a
secure
haven
and
for
ages
past
it
has
been
inhabited
only
by
them
there
several
species
of

a

the

was
piled

pushed
down
to
the
packing
place
for
several
years
this
went
on
and
the
birds
themselves
were
not
molested
at
last
however
a
tentacle
of
the

reached
out
to
laysan
in
an
evil
moment
in
the
spring
of
a
predatory
individual
of
honolulu
and
elsewhere
named
max
schlemmer
decided
that
the
wings
of
those
albatross
gulls
and
terns
should
be
torn
off
and
sent
to
japan
whence
they
would
undoubtedly
be

organized
a

on

with
the
utmost
secrecy
he
sailed
from
honolulu
landed
his
upon
the
wonderland
and
turned
them
loose
upon
the
birds
for
several
months
they
slaughtered
diligently
and
without
mercy
apparently
it
was
the
ambition
of
schlemmer
to
kill
every
bird
on
the
island
by
the
time
the
had
accumulated
between
three
and
four
of
wings
and
the
carnage
was
half
finished
william

heard
of

the

the

to
the

of

when
captain
jacobs
arrived
he
found
that
in
round
numbers
about
hundred
birds
had
been
destroyed
and
all
that
remained
of
them
were
several
acres
of
bones
and
dead
bodies
and
about
three
carloads
of
wings
feathers
and
skins
it
was
evident
that
schlemmer
intention
was
to
kill
all
the
birds
on
the
island

only
the
timely
arrival
of
the
frustrated
that

the

poachers
were
arrested

the
exception
of

interesting
to
the
friends
of
birds
here
is
what
he
has
said
regarding
the
evidences
of
our
first
impression
of
laysan
was
that
the
poachers
had
stripped
the
place
of
bird
life
an
area
of
over
acres
on
each
side
of
the
buildings

apparently
abandoned

their
burrows
the
little
wingless
rail

another

the
saucy

remained
it

an
excellent
example

survival

the
inconspicuous

side

bones

in

where
the
poachers
had
piled
the
bodies
of
the
birds
as
they
stripped
them
of
wings
and
feathers
in
the
old
open
guano
shed
were
seen
the
remains
of
hundreds
and
possibly
thousands
of
wings
which
were
placed
there
but
never
cured

the
marauders
were

story
of
cruelty
that
surpasses
anything
else
done
by
these
heartless
sanguinary
pirates

excepting
the
practice
of
cutting
wings
from
living

the

the
report
of

bryan
contains
the
following
pertinent
paragraphs
this
wholesale
killing
has
had
an
appalling
effect
on
the
colony
it
is
conservative
to
say
that
fully
the
number
of
birds
of
both
species
of
albatross
that
were
so
abundant
everywhere
in
have
been
killed
the
colonies
that
remain
are
in
a
sadly
decimated
condition
over
a
large
part
of
the
island
in
some
sections
a
hundred
acres
in
a
place
that
ten
years
ago
were
thickly
inhabited
by
albatrosses
not
a
single
bird
remains
while
heaps
of
the
slain
lie
as
mute
testimony
of
the
awful
slaughter
of
these
beautiful
harmless
and
without
doubt
beneficial
inhabitants
of
the
high
seas
while
the
main
activity
of
the
was
directed
against
the
albatrosses
they
were
by
no
means
averse
to
killing
anything
in
the
bird
line
that
came
in
their
way
fortunately
serious
as
were
the
depredations
of
the
poachers
their
operations
were
interrupted
before
any
of
the
species
had
been
completely
exterminated
but
the
work
of
the
evil
genius
of
laysan
did
not
stop
with
the
slaughter
of
three
hundred
thousand
birds
schlemmer
introduced
rabbits
and
and
these
rapidly
multiplying
rodents
now
are
threatening
to
consume
every
plant
on
the
island
if
the
plants
disappear
many
of
the
insects
will
go
with
them
and
this
will
mean
the
disappearance
of
the
small
insectivorous
birds
in
february
president
roosevelt
issued
an
executive
order
creating
the

reservation
for
birds
in
this
are
included
laysan
and
twelve
other
islands
and
reefs
some
of
which
are
inhabited
by
birds
that
are
well
worth
preserving
by
this
act
we
may
feel
that
for
the
future
the
birds
of
laysan
and
neighboring
islets
are
secure
from
further
attacks
by
the
agents
of
the
vain
women

chapter

unfair
firearms
and
shooting
ethics
for
considerably
more
than
a
century
the
states
of
the
american
union
have
enacted
laws
based
on
the
principle
that
the
wild
game
belongs
to
the
people
and
the
people
senators
representatives
and
legislators
generally
may
therefore
enact
laws
for
its
protection
prescribing
the
manner
in
which
it
may
and
may
not
be
taken
and
possessed
the
soundness
of
this
principle
has
been
fully
confirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
the
case
of
geer
connecticut
on
march
the
tendency
of
predatory
man
to
kill
and
capture
wild
game
of
all
kinds
by
wholesale
methods
is
as
old
as
the
human
race
the
days
of
the
club
the
stone
axe
the
bow
and
arrow
and
the
gun
were
contemporaneous
with
the
days
of
great
abundance
of
game
now
that
the
advent
of
repeaters
automatics
and
fixed
ammunition
has
rendered
game
scarce
in
all
localities
save
a
very
few
the
thoughtful
man
is
driven
to
consider
measures
for
the
checking
of
destruction
and
the
suppression
of
wholesale
slaughter
first
of
all
the
deadly
floating
batteries
and
were
prohibited
a
punt
gun
is
justly
regarded
as
a
relic
of
barbarism
and
any
man
who
uses
one
places
himself
beyond
the
pale
of
decent
sportsmanship
or
even
of
modern
strange
to
say
although
the
unwritten
code
of
ethics
of
english
sportsmen
is
very
strict
the
english
to
this
day
permit
hunting
with
guns
of
huge
calibre
some
of
which
are
more
like
than
and
they
say
well
there
are
still
wild
duck
on
our
coast
beyond
question
it
is
now
high
time
for
the
english
people
to
take
up
the
question
and
consider
what
is
fair
and
unfair
in
the
killing
of
waterfowl
the
supply
of
british
ducks
and
geese
can
not
forever
withstand
the
market
gunners
and
their
has
not
the
british
supply
greatly
decreased
during
the
past
fifteen
years
i
strongly
suspect
that
a
careful
investigation
would
reveal
the
fact
that
it
has
diminished
the
society
for
the
preservation
of
the
fauna
of
the
empire
should
look
into
the
matter
and
obtain
a
series
of
reports
on
the
condition
of
the
waterfowl
as
compared
with
what
it
was
twenty
years
ago
in
the
united
states
we
have
eliminated
the
swivel
guns
the
punt
guns
and
the
guns
among
the
real
sportsmen
the
tendency
is
steadily
toward
of
small
calibre
especially
under
but
outside
the
ranks
of
sportsmen
we
are
now
face
to
face
with
two
automatic
and
five
pump
shotguns
of
deadly
efficiency
of
these
more
than
one
hundred
thousand
are
being
made

the

of

are
miles
ahead
of
the
men
who
handle

and
in

field

the

catch
up
the

steadily
diminished
the
weight
of
the
rod
and
the
size
of
the
line
and
they
have
prohibited
the
use
of
gang
hooks
and
nets
in
this
respect
the
initiative
of
the
tuna
club
of
santa
catalina
is
worthy
of
the
highest
admiration
even
though
the
leaping
tuna
the
jewfish
and
the
are
big
and
powerful
the
club
has
elected
to
raise
the
standard
of
sportsmanship
by
making
captures
more
difficult
than
ever
before
a
higher
degree
of
skill
and
nerve
and
judgment
is
required
in
the
angler
who
would
make
good
on
a
big
fish
and
incidentally
the
fish
has
about
double
the
show
that
it
had
fifteen
years
ago
that
is
sportsmanship
but
how
is
it
with
the
men
who
handle
the
by
them
the
tuna
club
principle
has
been
exactly
reversed
in
the
making
of
commercialism
plays
small
part
but
in
about
forty
cases
out
of
every
fifty
the
making
of
guns
is
solely
a
matter
of
dollars
and
profits
excepting
the
condemnation
of
automatic
and
pump
guns
i
think
that
few
clubs
of
sportsmen
have
laid
down
laws
designed
to
make
shooting
more
difficult
and
to
give
the
game
more
of
a
show
to
escape
thousands
of
gentlemen
sportsmen
have
their
own
separate
unwritten
codes
of
honor
but
so
far
as
i
know
few
of
them
have
been
written
out
and
adopted
as
binding
rules
of
action
i
know
that
among
expert
wing
shots
it
is
an
unwritten
law
that
quail
and
grouse
must
not
be
shot
on
the
ground
nor
ducks
on
the
water
but
among
the
three
million
gunners
who
annually
shoot
in
the
united
states
how
many
think
you
are
there
who
in
actual
practice
observe
any
sentimental
principles
when
in
the
presence
of
killable
game
i
should
say
about
one
man
and
boy
out
of
every
five
hundred
up
to
this
time
the
great
mass
of
men
who
handle
guns
have
left
it
to
the
gunmakers
to
make
their
codes
of
ethics
and

output
of
at
a
recent
hearing
before
a
committee
of
the
house
of
representatives
at
washington
a
representative
of
the
industry
reported
that
in
the
year
ten
american
manufacturing
concerns
turned
out
the
following
rifles
and
revolvers
there
are
factories
producing
firearms
and
ammunition
employing
of
invested
capital
and
employees
the
sole
and
dominant
thought
of
many
gunmakers
is
to
make
the
very
deadliest
guns
that
human
skill
can
invent
sell
them
as
fast
as
possible
and
declare
dividends
on
their
stock
the
remington
winchester
marlin
stevens
and
union
companies
are
engaged
in
a
mad
race
to
see
who
can
turn
out
the
deadliest
guns
and
the
most
of
them
on
the
market
there
are
five
that
fire
six
shots
each
in
about
without
removal
from
the
shoulder
by
the
quick
sliding
of
a
sleeve
under
the
barrel
that
ejects
the
empty
shell
and
inserts
a
loaded
one
there
are
two
automatics
that
fire
five
shots
each
in
seconds
or
by
five
pulls
on
the
trigger
autoloading
gun
is
reloaded
and
cocked
again
wholly
by
its
own
now
if
these
are
not
machine
guns
what
are
they
in
view
of
the
great
scarcity
of
feathered
game
and
the
number
of
deadly
machine
guns
already
on
the
market
the
production
of
the
last
and
deadliest
automatic
gun
by
the
winchester
arms
company
in
great
is
a
crime
against
wild
life
no
less
every
human
action
is
a
matter
of
taste
and
individual
honor
it
is
natural
for
the
of
currituck
to
love
the
automatic
as
they
do
because
they
kill
the
most
ducks
per
flock
with
two
of
them
in
his
boat
holding
one
expert
can
and
sometimes
so
it
is
said
get
every
duck
out
of
a
flock
up
to
seven
or
eight
it
is
natural
for
an
awkward
and
blundering
to
love
the
deadliest
gun
in
order
that
he
may
make
as
good
a
bag
as
an
expert
shot
can
make
with
a
gun
it
is
natural
for
the
hunter
who
does
not
care
a
rap
about
the
extermination
of
species
to
love
the
gun
that
will
enable
him
to
kill
up
to
the
bag
limit
every
time
he
takes
the
field
it
is
natural
for
men
who
do
think
or
who
think
in
circles
to
say
so
long
as
i
observe
the
lawful
bag
limit
what
difference
does
it
make
what
kind
of
a
gun
i
use
it
is
natural
for
the
remington
and
winchester
and
marlin
to
say
as
they
do
enforce
the
laws
shorten
the
open
seasons
reduce
the
bag
limit
and
then
it
wo
matter
what
guns
are
used
but
touch
autoloading
guns
do
hamper
inventive
genius
is
it
not
high
time
for
american
sportsmen
to
cease
taking
their
moral
principles
and
their
codes
of
ethics
from
the
here
is
a
question
that
i
would
like
to
put
before
every
hunter
of
game
in
america
in
view
of
the
alarming
scarcity
of
game
in
view
of
the
impending
extermination
of
species
by
legal
hunting
can
any
can
any
either
sell
a
machine
or
use
one
in
hunting
a
gentleman
is
incapable
of
taking
an
unfair
advantage
of
any
wild
creature
therefore
a
gentleman
can
not
use
punt
guns
for
ducks
dynamite
for
game
fish
or
automatic
or
pump
guns
in
the
machine
guns
and
silencers
are
grossly
unfair
and
like
nets
and
dynamite
for
trout
and
bass
their
use
in
hunting
must
everywhere
be
prohibited
by
law
times
have
changed
and
the
lines
for
protection
must
be
more
tightly
drawn
illustration
the
champion

slaughter
case
one
hour

with
two
automatic
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
judge
orlady
has
decided
that
the
pennsylvania
law
against
the
use
of
automatic
guns
in
hunting
is
entirely
constitutional
because
every
state
has
a
right
to
say
how
its
game
may
and
may
not
be
killed
it
is
up
to
the
american
people
to
say
whether
their
wild
life
shall
be
slaughtered
by
machinery
or
not
if
they
are
willing
that
it
should
be
then
let
us
be
consistent
and
say
away
with
all
conservation
the
game
conservators
can
endure
a
gameless
and
birdless
continent
quite
as
well
as
the
average
citizen
can
how
they
there
are
a
few
apologists
for
the
automatic
and
pump
guns
who
cheerfully
say
so
long
as
the
bag
limit
is
observed
what
difference
does
it
make
how
the
birds
are
killed
it
is
strange
that
a
conscientious
man
should
ask
such
a
question
when
the
answer
is
apparent
we
reply
the
difference
is
that
an
automatic
or
pump
gun
will
kill
fully
twice
as
many
waterfowl
as
a
not
and
is
highly
undesirable
that
every
gunner
should
get
the
bag
limit
of
birds
or
any
number
near
the
birds
can
not
stand
it
moreover
best
states
for
ducks
and
geese
have
no
bag
limits
on
those
on
currituck
sound
for
example
the
market
hunters
are
killing
all
the
waterfowl
they
can
sell
on
marsh
island
louisiana
one
man
has
killed
ducks
in
one
day
and
another
market
gunner
killed
in
one
day
the
automatic
and
the
pump
are
the
favorite
weapons
of
the
who
makes
a
specialty
of
geese
and
ducks
it
is
no
uncommon
thing
for
a
gunner
who
shoots
a
machine
gun
to
get
with
one
gun
as
high
as
birds
out
of
one
flock
a
man
who
has
himself
done
this
has
told
me
so
champion
here
is
a
story
from
california
that
is
no
fairy
tale
it
was
published
most
innocently
in
a
western
magazine
with
the
illustration
that
appears
herewith
and
in
which
please
notice
the
automatic
february
i
and
a
friend
were
at
one
of
the
glenn
county
camps
neither
of
us
having
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
shooting
over
live
decoys
we
were
anxious
and
could
hardly
wait
for
the
sport
to
commence
on
arriving
at
the
scene
we
noticed
holes
which
had
been
dug
in
the
ground
just
large
enough
for
a
man
to
crawl
into
these
holes
were
used
for
hiding
places
and
were
deep
enough
so
the
sportsmen
would
be
entirely
out
of
sight
of
the
game
the
birds
are
so
wild
that
to
move
a
finger
will
frighten
them
the
decoys
are
wild
geese
which
had
been
crippled
and
tamed
for
this
purpose
they
are
placed
inside
of
silk
net
fences
which
are
located
on
each
side
of
the
holes
dug
for
hiding
places
these
nets
are
the
color
of
the
ground
and
it
is
impossible
for
the
wild
geese
flying
overhead
to
detect
the
difference
after
we
had
investigated
everything
the
expert
caller
and
owner
of
the
outfit
exclaimed
your
holes
we
noticed
in
the
distance
a
flock
of
geese
coming
our
caller
in
a
few
seconds
had
their
attention
and
they
headed
towards
our
decoys
soon
they
were
directly
over
us
but
out
of
easy
range
of
our
guns
we
were
anxious
to
shoot
but
in
obedience
to
our
boss
had
to
keep
still
and
soon
noticed
that
the
birds
were
soaring
around
and
in
a
short
time
were
within
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
of
us
at
that
moment
we
heard
the
command
and
the
bombardment
that
followed
was
beyond
imagining
had
fired
five
shots
apiece
and
found
we
had
bagged
ten
geese
from
this
one
at
the
end
of
one
hour
shooting
we
had
birds
to
our
credit
and
were
out
of
ammunition
on
finding
that
no
more
shells
were
in
our
pits
we
took
our
dead
geese
to
the
camp
and
returned
with
a
new
supply
of
ammunition
we
remained
in
the
pits
during
the
entire
day
when
the
sun
had
gone
behind
the
mountains
we
summed
up
our
kill
and
amounted
to
the
picture
shown
with
this
article
gives
a
view
of
first
a
photograph
would
have
been
taken
of
the
remainder
of
the
shoot
but
it
being
warm
weather
the
birds
had
to
be
shipped
at
once
in
order
to
keep
them
from
spoiling
illustration
slaughtered
according
to
law
a
result
of
a
faulty
system
such
pictures
as
this
are
very
common
in
sportsmen
magazines
note
the
automatic
gun
supper
was
then
eaten
after
which
we
were
driven
back
to
willows
both
agreeing
that
it
was
one
of
the
greatest
days
of
sport
we
ever
had
and
wishing
that
we
might
through
the
courtesy
of
the
glenn
county
goose
club
have
another
such
day
another
picture
was
published
in
a
canadian
magazine
illustrating
a
story
from
which
i
quote
i
fixed
the
decoys
hid
my
boat
and
took
my
position
in
the
blind
my
man
started
his
work
with
a
will
and
hustled
the
ducks
out
of
every
cove
inlet
or
piece
of
marsh
for
two
miles
around
i
had
barely
time
to
slip
the
cartridges
into
my
guns
a
double
and
the
other
a
five
shot
when
i
saw
a
brace
of
birds
coming
toward
me
they
sailed
in
over
my
decoys
i
rose
to
the
occasion
and
the
leader
and
tumbled
in
among
the
decoys
the
other
bird
unable
to
stop
quick
enough
came
directly
over
me
he
closed
his
wings
and
struck
the
ground
in
the
rear
of
the
blind
more
and
more
followed
sometimes
they
came
singly
and
then
in
twos
and
threes
i
kept
busy
and
attended
to
each
bird
as
quickly
as
possible
whenever
there
was
a
lull
in
the
flight
i
went
out
in
the
boat
and
picked
up
the
dead
leaving
the
wounded
to
take
chances
with
any
gunner
lucky
enough
to
catch
them
in
open
and
smooth
water
a
bird
handy
in
the
air
is
worth
two
wounded
ones
in
the
water
i
took
six
dead
birds
out
of
the
water
for
seven
shots
and
both
guns
the
ball
thus
opened
the
birds
commenced
to
move
in
all
directions
until
the
morning
flight
was
over
i
was
kept
busy
pumping
lead
with
the
then
with
the
reloading
picking
up
the
dead
etc
and
the
reader
will
observe
that
the
harmless
innocent
inoffensive
automatic
shot
gun
that
do
matter
if
you
enforce
the
bag
limit
figures
prominently
in
both
stories
and
both
photographs
story
of
two
pump
guns
and
it
comes
from
aberdeen
sand
lake
in
the
spring
of
humphrey
tells
it
in
magazine
for
july
smith
and
i
were
about
a
hundred
yards
from
them
the
flock
of
canada
geese
when
murphy
scared
them
they
rose
in
a
dense
mass
and
came
directly
between
smith
and
me
we
were
about
gunshot
distance
apart
and
they
were
not
over
thirty
feet
in
the
air
when
we
opened
up
on
them
with
our
pump
guns
and
no
shot
when
the
smoke
cleared
away
and
we
had
rounded
up
the
cripples
we
found
we
had
geese
i
have
heard
of
bigger
killings
out
in
this
country
but
never
positively
knew
of
them
so
then
two
gunners
averaged
wild
geese
per
pump
gun
out
of
one
and
yet
there
are
wise
and
reflective
sportsmen
who
say
what
difference
does
the
kind
of
gun
make
so
long
as
you
live
up
to
the
law
i
think
that
the
pump
and
automatic
guns
make
about
of
difference
against
the
that
is
all
the
number
of
now
in
use
in
the
united
states
is
almost
beyond
belief
about
six
years
ago
a
gentleman
interested
in
the
manufacture
of
such
weapons
informed
me
and
his
statement
has
never
been
disputed
that
about
new
were
sold
in
the
united
states
the
number
of
shot
cartridges
annually
produced
by
our
four
great

companies
has
been
reliably
estimated
as

dear
sir
regarding
the
use
of
the
automatic
would
say
that
i
am
a
member
of
two
southern
ducking
clubs
where
these
guns
are
used
very
extensively
i
have
seen
a
flock
of
ducks
come
into
a
blind
where
one
two
or
even
three
of
these
guns
were
in
use
and
have
seen
as
many
as
eleven
shots
poured
into
a
single
flock
we
have
considerable
poaching
on
one
of
these
clubs
the
territory
being
so
extensive
that
it
is
impossible
to
prevent
it
we
own
acres
and
these
poachers
i
am
told
nearly
all
use
the
automatic
guns
they
frequently
kill
six
or
eight
ducks
out
of
one
flock
first
taking
a
raking
shot
on
the
water
and
then
getting
in
the
balance
of
the
magazine
before
the
flock
is
out
of
range
in
fact
some
of
them
carry
two
guns
and
are
able
to
discharge
a
part
of
the
second
magazine
into
the
same
flock
as
i
told
you
the
other
evening
i
am
not
so
much
against
the
gun
when
in
the
hands
of
gentlemen
and
real
sportsmen
but
on
account
of
its
terrible
possibilities
for
market
hunters
i
believe
that
the
only
safe
way
is
to
abolish
it
entirely
and
that
the
better
class
should
be
willing
to
give
up
this
weapon
as
being
the
only
means
of
putting
a
stop
to
this
willful

how

each
one
of

organizations
chiefly
clubs
of
gentlemen
sportsmen
have
adopted
strong
resolutions
condemning
the

by
the
news
that
an
englishman
whose
identity
is
concealed
under
the
initials
has
invented
and
manufactured
a
rifle
specially
intended
to
kill
ducks
that
are
beyond
the
reach
of
a

the
weapon
discharges
all
three
barrels
simultaneously
in
the
of
it
is
described
by
a
writer
who
also
thoughtfully
conceals
his
identity
under

shots
the
writer
declares
that
the
is
a
really
practicable
weapon
and
that
with
it
one
could
bag
that
were
quite
out

of

why
a

the

fails
to

sunday
gun
a
new
weapon
of
peculiar
form
and
great
deadliness
to
song
birds
has
recently
come
into
use
because
of
the
manner
of
its
use
it
is
known
as
the
sunday
gun
it
is
specially
adapted
to
concealment
on
the
person
a
man
could
go
through
a
reception
with
one
of
these
deadly
weapons
absolutely
concealed
under
his
dress
coat
it
is
a
weapon
with
two
barrels
rifle
and
shot
and
it
enables
the
user
to
kill
anything
from
a
up
to
a
deer
what
the
can
not
kill
the
rifle
will
it
is
not
a
gun
that
any
sportsman
would
own
save
as
a
curiosity
or
for
target
use
the
state
ornithologist
of
massachusetts
forbush
informs
me
that
already
the
sunday
gun
has
become
a
scourge
to
the
bird
life
of
that
state
thousands
of
them
are
used
by
men
and
boys
who
live
in
cities
and
towns
and
are
able
to
get
into
the
country
only
on
sundays
they
conceal
them
under
their
coats
on
sunday
mornings
go
out
into
the
country
and
spend
the
day
in
shooting
small
birds
and
mammals
the
dead
birds
are
concealed
in
various
pockets
the
sunday
gun
goes
under
the
coat
and
at
nightfall
the
guerrilla
rides
back
to
the
city
with
an
innocent
smile
on
his
face
as
if
he
had
spent
a
day
in
harmless
enjoyment
of
the
beauties
of
nature
the
sunday
gun
is
on
sale
everywhere
and
it
is
said
to
be
in
use
both
by
american
and
italian
killers
of
it
weighs
only
two
pounds
eight
ounces
and
its
cost
is
so
trifling
that
any
guerrilla
who
wishes
one
can
easily
find
the
money
for
its
purchase
there
are
in
the
united
states
at
least
a
million
men
and
boys
quite
mean
enough
to
use
this
weapon
on
swallows
woodpeckers
nuthatches
rabbits
and
squirrels
and
like
other
criminals
hide
both
weapon
and
loot
in
their
clothing
so
long
as
this
gun
is
in
circulation
no
small
bird
is
safe
at
any
season
near
any
city
or
town
now
what
are
the
people
going
to
do
about
it
my
recommendation
is
that
each
state
enact
a
law
in
the
following
terms
be
it
enacted
that
from
and
after
the
passage
of
this
act
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
to
use
in
hunting
or
to
carry
concealed
on
the
person
any
shotgun
or
rifle
or
combination
of
shotgun
and
rifle
with
a
barrel
or
barrels
less
than
inches
in
length
or
with
a
skeleton
stock
fixed
on
a
hinge
the
carrying
of
any
rifle
or
shotgun
concealed
on
the
person
shall
constitute
a
felony
the
penalties
for
hunting
with
any
gun
specially
adapted
to
concealment
should
be
not
less
than
fine
or
two
months
imprisonment
at
hard
labor
and
the
carrying
of
such
weapons
concealed
should
be
or
four
months
at
hard
labor
incidentally
we
wonder
what
will
be
the
next
devilish
device
for
the
destruction
of
wild
life
that
american
inventive
genius
will
produce

the
sunday
gun

chapter
xvi
the
present
and
future
of
north
american
big
game
the
subject
of
this
chapter
opens
up
a
vast
field
of
facts
and
conclusions
quite
broad
enough
to
fill
a
whole
volume
in
the
space
at
our
disposal
here
it
is
possible
to
offer
only
a
summary
of
the
subject
without
attempting
to
prove
our
statements
by
the
production
of
detailed
evidence
to
say
that
all
over
the
world
the
large
land
mammals
are
being
destroyed
more
rapidly
than
they
are
breeding
would
not
be
literally
true
for
the
reason
that
there
are
yet
many
areas
that
are
almost
untouched
by
the
destroying
hand
of
civilized
man
it
is
true
however
that
all
the
unspoiled
areas
rapidly
are
growing
fewer
and
smaller
it
is
also
true
that
in
all
the
regions
of
the
earth
that
are
easily
penetrable
by
civilized
man
the
wild
life
is
being
killed
faster
than
it
breeds
and
of
necessity
it
is
disappearing
this
is
why
the
british
are
now
so
urgently
bestirring
themselves
to
create
game
preserves
in
all
the
countries
that
they
own
it
is
one
of
the
inexorable
laws
of
nature
to
which
i
know
of
not
one
exception
that
large
hoofed
animals
which
live
on
open
plains
on
open
mountains
or
in
regions
that
are
thinly
forested
always
are
easily
found
and
easily
exterminated
all
such
animals
have
a
weak
hold
on
life
this
is
because
it
is
so
difficult
for
them
to
hide
and
so
very
easy
for
man
to
creep
up
within
the
killing
range
of
modern
rifles
is
it
not
pitiful
to
think
of
animals
like
the
caribou
moose
white
sheep
and
bear
trying
to
survive
on
the
naked
ridges
and
bald
mountains
of
yukon
territory
and
alaska
with
a
modern
rifle
the
greatest
duffer
on
earth
can
creep
up
within
killing
distance
of
any
of
the
big
game
of
the
north
the
gray
wolf
is
practically
the
only
large
animal
that
is
able
to
hide
successfully
and
survive
in
the
treeless
regions
of
the
north
but
his
room
is
always
preferable
to
his
company
because
he
too
is
a
destroyer
of
big
game
i
am
tempted
to
try
to
map
out
roughly
what
are
the
unopened
and
undestroyed
wild
haunts
of
big
game
in
north
america
in
doing
this
however
i
warn
the
reader
not
to
be
deceived
into
thinking
that
because
game
still
exists
in
those
regions
those
areas
therefore
constitute
a
permanent
preserve
and
safe
for
large
mammals
that
is
very
very
far
from
being
the
case
the
further
opening
up
of
the
wilderness
areas
as
i
shall
call
them
for
convenience
can
and
surely
will
quickly
wipe
out
their
big
game
for
throughout
of
those
areas
it
holds
to
life
by
very
slender
threads
the
unopened
and
undestroyed
wilderness
areas
of
north
america
wherein
large
mammals
still
live
in
a
normal

but
have
been
literally
shot
to
pieces
by
gunners
in

there
are
about
fifteen
localities
which
contain
a
supply
of

sufficient
that

conscientious
sportsman
might
therein
hunt

kill

would

from

i
only
wish
to
high
heaven
that
we
had
the
power
to
carry
such
a
program
as
that
into
effect
we
would
see
some
game
in

and
our
would
thank
us
for
some
real
protection
at
a
critical
period
except
in
the
few
localities
i
regard
the
situation
in
the
united
states
and
southern
canada
as
particularly
desperate
unless
there
is
an
immediate
and
complete
revolution
in
this
country
from
an
era
of
slaughter
to
an
era
of
preservation
as
sure
as
the
sun
rises
on
the
morrow
outside
of
the
hard
and
fast
game
preserves
and
places
like
maine
and
the
adirondacks
this
generation
of
americans
and
will
live
to
see
our
country
clean
of
big
two
years
ago
i
did
not
believe
this
but
i
do
now
it
is
impossible
to
exaggerate
the
wide
extent
or
the
seriousness
of
this
situation
in
a
country
where
any
and
every
individual
can
rise
and
bluster
and
bellow
for
his
rights
as
a
there
is
no
stopping
the
millions
who
kill
whenever
there
is
an
open
season
and
to
many
americans
no
right
is
dearer
than
the
right
to
kill
the
game
which
by
even
the
commonest
law
of
equity
belongs
not
to
the
shooter
exclusively
but
partly
to
two
thousand
other
persons
who
do
shoot
at
all
unless
we
come
to
an
about
face
in
quick
time
all
our
big
game
outside
the
preserves
is
doomed
to
sure
and
quick
extermination
this
is
not
an
individual
opinion
merely
it
is
a
and
a
hundred
thousand
men
know
it
to
be
such
last
winter
because
the
deer
of
montana
were
driven
by
cold
and
hunger
out
of
the
mountains
and
far
down
into
the
valleys
eleven
thousand
of
them
were
ruthlessly
slaughtered
state
game
warden
avare
says
that
often
heads
of
families
took
out
as
many
licenses
as
there
were
persons
in
the
family
and
the
whole
quota
was
killed
such
people
deserve
to
go
deerless
into
the
future
but
we
can
not
allow
them
to
rob
innocent
people
our
species
of
big
game
the
antelope
unique
and
wonderful
will
be
one
of
first
species
of
north
american
big
game
to
become
totally
we
may
see
this
come
to
pass
within
twenty
years
they
can
not
be
bred
in
protection
in
very
large
fenced
they
are
delicate
capricious
and
easily
upset
they
die
literally
at
the
drop
of
a
hat
they
are
quite
subject
to
actinomycosis
which
in
wild
animals
is
incurable
already
all
the
states
that
possess
wild
antelope
except
nevada
have
passed
laws
giving
that
species
long
close
seasons
which
is
highly
creditable
to
the
states
that
have
done
their
duty
nevada
must
get
in

at
the
next
session
of

in

protection
the
following
in

to
the

antelope
are
still
found
in
diminished
numbers
in
fourteen
western
states
a
considerable
number
were
killed
during
the
year
in
montana
where
the
species
seems
to
have
suffered
more
than
elsewhere
since
the
season
was
opened
in
a
striking
illustration
of
the
decrease
of
the

is
afforded
by
colorado
in
the

estimated
that
there
were
in

whereas
in
the

commissioner
places
the
number
at
only
the
total
number
of

now
in
the

probably
does
not
exceed
distributed
approximately
as
follows

wyoming
palmer
says
the
total
number
of
antelope
is
less
than
it
was
in
and
in
spite
of
protection
the
number
is
steadily
diminishing
this
is
indeed
serious
news
the
existing
bands
already
small
are
steadily
growing
smaller
the
antelope
are
killed
lawlessly
and
the
crimes
of
such
slaughter
are
in
nearly
every
instance
successfully
concealed
previously
we
have
based
strong
hopes
for
the
preservation
of
the
antelope
species
on
the
herd
in
the
yellowstone
park
but
those
animals
are
vanishing
fearfully
fast
in
palmer
reported
that
about
fifteen
hundred
antelope
came
down
to
the
feeding
grounds
near
the
haystacks
in
the
vicinity
of
gardiner
in
the
yellowstone
park
was
credited
with
two
thousand
head
the
number
alive
by
actual
count
is
only
five
hundred
and
this
after
years
of
protection
where
have
the
others
gone
this
shows
alas
that
perpetual
close

antelope
here
is
a
reliable
report
june
regarding
the
antelope
in
lower
california
from
nelson
antelope
formerly
ranged
over
nearly
the
entire
length
of
lower
california
but
are
now
gone
from
a
large
part
of
their
ancient
range
and
their
steadily
decreasing
numbers
indicate
their
early
extinction
throughout
the
peninsula
in
captivity
the
antelope
is
exasperatingly
delicate
and
it
has
about
as
much
stamina
as
a
pet
monkey
as
an
exhibition
animal
in
zoological
gardens
and
parks
it
is
a
failure
for
it
always
looks
faded
spiritless
and
dead
like
a
stuffed
animal
ready
to
be
thrown
into
the
discard
zoologists
can
not
save
the
species
save
at
long
range
in
preserves
so
huge
that
the
sensitive
little
beast
will
not
even
suspect
that
it
is
confined
two
serious
attempts
have
been
made
to
transplant
and
acclimatize
the
antelope
in
the
wichita
national
bison
range
in
oklahoma
and
in
the
montana
bison
range
at
ravalli
in
the
boone
and
crockett
club
provided
a
fund
which
defrayed
the
expenses
of
shipping
from
the
yellowstone
park
a
small
nucleus
herd
to
each
of
those
ranges
eight
were
sent
to
the
wichita
range
of
which
five
arrived
alive
of
the
seven
sent
to
the
montana
range
four
arrived
alive
and
were
duly
set
free
while
it
seems
a
pity
to
take
specimens
from
the
yellowstone
park
herd
the
disagreeable
fact
is
that
there
is
no
other
source
on
which
to
draw
for
breeding
stock
the
provinces
of
alberta
and
saskatchewan
in
canada
still
permit
the
hunting
and
killing
of
antelope
which
is
wholly
and
entirely
wrong
the
of
north
american
big
game
the
of
the
rockies
will
be
after
the
antelope
the
next
species
to
become
extinct
outside
of
protected
areas
in
the
united
states
that
event
is
fast
approaching
it
is
far
nearer
than
even
the
sportsmen
realize
there
are
only
two
localities
in
the
four
states
that
still
they
have
killable
sheep
in
which
it
is
worth
while
to
go
one
is
in
montana
and
the
other
is
in
wyoming
in
the
united
states
a
really
big
creditable
ram
may
now
be
regarded
as
an
impossibility
there
are
now
perhaps
half
a
dozen
guides
who
can
find
killable
sheep
in
our
country
but
the
game
is
nearly
always
young
rams
under
five
years
of
age
that
wyoming
montana
idaho
and
washington
still
continue
to
permit
sheep
slaughter
is
outrageous
their
answer
is
that
the
sportsmen
stand
for
stopping
it
altogether
i
will
add
and
the
great
mass
of
people
are
too
criminally
indifferent
to
take
a
hand
in
the
matter
and
their
regardless
of
the
men
of
blood
the
seed
stock
of
sheep
now
alive
in
the
united
states
aggregates
a
pitifully
small
number
after
years
of
unbroken
protection
in
colorado
dillon
wallace
estimates
after
an
investigation
on
the
ground
that
the
state
possesses
perhaps
hundred
head
he
credits
montana
and
wyoming
with
five
hundred
each
which
i
think
is
far
too
liberal
a
number
i
do
not
believe
that
either
of
those
states
contains
more
than
one
hundred
unprotected
sheep
at
the
very
utmost
limit
if
there
are
more
where
are
they
in
the
yellowstone
park
there
are
head
safe
and
sound
and
slowly
increasing
i
can
not
understand
why
they
have
not
increased
more
rapidly
than
they
have
in
glacier
park
now
under
permanent
protection
three
guides
on
lake
mcdonald
in
estimated
the
number
of
sheep
at
seven
hundred
idaho
has
in
her
rugged
bitter
root
and
clearwater
mountains
and
elsewhere
a
remnant
of
possibly
two
hundred
sheep
and
washington
has
only
what
chemists
call
a
trace
it
has
recently
been
discovered
that
california
still
contains
a
few
sheep
and
in
southwestern
nevada
there
are
a
few
more
in
utah
the
species
is
probably
quite
extinct
in
arizona
there
are
a
few
very
small
bands
very
widely
scattered
they
are
in
the
santa
catalina
mountains
the
grand
canyon
country
the
gila
range
and
the
quitovaquita
mountains
near
sonoyta
but
who
can
protect
from
slaughter
those
arizona
sheep
absolutely
no
one
they
are
too
few
and
too
widely
scattered
for
the
game
wardens
to
keep
in
touch
with
them
the
prospectors
have
them
entirely
at
their
mercy
and
the
world
well
knows
what
prospectors
mercy
to
edible
big
game
looks
like
on
the
ground
it
leads
straight
to
the
the
coyotes
and
the
vultures
the
lower
california
peninsula
contains
about
five
hundred
mountain
sheep
without
the
slightest
protection
save
low
desert
mountains
heat
and
thirst
but
that
is
no
real
protection
whatever
those
sheep
are
too
fine
to
be
butchered
the
way
they
have
been
and
now
are
being
butchered
in
i
strongly
called
the
attention
of
the
mexican
government
to
the
situation
and
the
departmento
de
fomento
secured
the
issue
of
an
executive
order
forbidding
the
hunting
of
any
big
game
in
lower
california
without
the
written
authority
of
the
government
i
am
sure
however
that
owing
to
the
political
and
military
upheaval
it
never
stopped
the
slaughter
of
sheep
in
such
easy
mountains
as
those
of
lower
california
it
is
a
simple
matter
to
exterminate
quickly
all
the
mountain
sheep
that
they
possess
the
time
for
president
madero
and
his
cabinet
to
inaugurate
serious
protective
measures
has
fully
arrived
both
british
columbia
and
alberta
have
even
yet
fine
herds
of

we
can
count
three

in
which
they
are
protected
they
are

the

park
near

and
waterton
lakes
park
in
the
southwestern
corner
of
alberta
in
view
of
the
number
of
men
who
desire
to
hunt
them
the
bag
limit
on
rams
in
british
columbia
and
alberta
still
is
too
liberal
by
half
one
ram
per
year
for
one
man
is
quite
as
much
so
as
one
moose
is
the
limit
everywhere
a
big
old
ram
is
regarded
by
sportsmen
as
a
much
more
desirable
and
creditable
trophy
than
a
moose
because
is
easy
and
the
bagging
of
an
old
mountain
ram
in
real
mountains
requires
five
times
as
much
effort
and
skill
the
splendid
high
and
rugged
mountains
of
british
columbia
and
alberta
form
an
ideal
home
for
the
and
mountain
goat
and
it
would
be
an
international
calamity
for
that
region
to
be
denuded
of
its
splendid
big
game
with
resolute
intent
and
judicial
treatment
that
region
can
remain
a
rich
and
valuable
hunting
ground
for
five
hundred
years
to
come
under
falsely
liberal
laws
it
can
be
shot
into
a
state
of
complete
desolation
within
ten
years
or
even
less
other

in
northern
british

north
of

and
the
waters

the

of

wilderness
ranges
the
black
mountain
sheep
and
throughout
the
remainder
with
many
sheepless
intervals
is
scattered
the
white
mountain
sheep
owing
to
the
immensity
of
this
wilderness
the
total
lack
of
railroads
and
also
of
navigable
waters
excepting
the
yukon
it
will
not
be
thoroughly
opened
up
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
the
few
resolute
and
sportsmen
who
can
wade
into
the
country
pulling
boats
through
mountain
streams
are
not
going
to
devastate
those
millions
of
mountains
of
their
big
game
the
few
head
of
game
which
sportsmen
can
and
will
take
out
of
the
great
northwestern
wilderness
during
the
next
years
will
hardly
be
missed
from
the
grand
total
even
though
a
few
localities
are
shot
out
it
is
the
deadly
resident
trappers
hunters
and
prospectors
who
must
be
feared
and
again
can
control
them
can
any
wilderness
government
on
earth
make
it
possible
therefore
time
even
the
great
wilderness
will
be
denuded
of
big
this
is
absolutely
fixed
and
certain
for
within
much
less
than
another
century
every
square
rod
of
it
will
have
been
gone
over
by
prospectors
lumbermen
trappers
and
and
raked
again
and
again
with
combs
a
railway
line
to
dawson
the
copper

cook
inlet
is
merely
the
next
thing
to
expect
after
canada
present
railway
program
has
been
wrought
out
yes
indeed
in
time
the
wilderness
will
be
opened
up
and
the
big
game
will
be
shot
out
save
from
the
protected
areas
the
mountain
even
yet
this
species
is
not
wholly
extinct
in
the
united
states
it
survives
in
glacier
park
montana
and
the
number
estimated
in
that
region
by
three
guide
friends
is
too
astoundingly
large
to
mention
this
animal
is
much
more
easily
killed
than
the
its
white
coat
renders
it
fatally
conspicuous
at
long
range
during
the
best
hunting
season
it
is
almost
devoid
of
fear
and
it
takes
altogether
too
many
chances
on
man
thanks
to
the
rage
for
sheep
horns
the
average
sportsman
regarding
wild
life
ranks
a
goat
head
about
six
contours
below
old
ram
heads
in
desirability
furthermore
most
guides
regard
the
flesh
of
the
goat
as
almost
unfit
for
use
as
food
and
far
inferior
to
that
of
the
these
reasons
taken
together
render
the
goats
much
less
persecuted
by
the
sportsmen
ranchmen
and
prospectors
who
enter
the
home
of
the
two
species
it
was
because
of
this
indifference
toward
goats
that
in
john
phillips
and
his
party
saw
goats
in
thirty
days
in
goat
mountain
park
and
only
fourteen
sheep
unless
the
preferences
of
western
sportsmen
and
gunners
change
very
considerably
the
coast
mountains
of
the
great
northwestern
wilderness
will
remain
stocked
with
wild
mountain
goats
until
long
after
the
last
has
been
shot
to
death
fortunately
the
skin
of
the
mountain
goat
has
no
commercial
value
i
think
it
was
in
that
i
purchased
in
denver
nicely
tanned
skins

the
first
exhibit
ever
made
to
illustrate
the
extermination
of

large

and
they
were

at

it
must
have
cost
the

to

the

it

naturally

we
are
glad
that

one
thing
that
a
hungry
pioneer
can
not
withstand
is
temptation
in
a
form
that
embraces
five
hundred
pounds
of
succulent
flesh
and
let
it
not
be
supposed
that
in
the
eastern
states
there
were
only
a
few
elk
the
pennsylvania
salt
licks
were
crowded
with
them
and
the
early
writers
describe
them
as
existing
in
immense
bands
and
great
numbers
of
course
it
is
impossible
for
wild
animals
of
great
size
to
exist
in
countries
that
are
covered
with
farms
villages
and
people
under
such
conditions
the
wild
and
the
tame
can
not
harmonize
it
is
a
fact
however
that
elk
could
exist
and
thrive
in
every
national
forest
and
national
park
in
our
country
and
also
on
uncountable
hundreds
of
thousands
of
rough
wild
timbered
hills
and
mountains
such
as
exist
in
probably
different
states
there
is
no
reason
except
greed
and
foolishness
why
there
are
not
one
hundred
thousand
elk
living
in
the
allegheny
mountains
furnishing
each
year
fifty
thousand
males
as
free
food
for
the
people
the
trouble
is
the
greedy
habitants
be
induced
to
kill
only
the
in
the
fall
and
let
the
cows
calves
and
breeding
bulls
alone
by
sensible
management
the
rocky
mountains
the
sierra
nevadas
and
the
coast
range
would
support
enough
wild
elk
to
feed
a
million
people
but
we
americans
seem
utterly
incapable
of
maintaining
anywhere
from
decade
to
decade
a
large
and
really
valuable
supply
of
wild
game
outside
the
yellowstone
park
and
northwestern
wyoming
the
american
elk
exists
only
in
small
bands
mere
remnants
and
samples
of
the
millions
we
could
and
should
have
they
could
be
protected
and
the
surplus
presently
killed
according
to
some
rational
working
system
then
national
forest
in
the
united
states
should
be
stocked
with
in
view
of
the
awful
cost
of
beef
cents
per
pound
in
chicago
the
it
is
high
time
that
we
should
consider
the
raising
of
game
on
the
public
domain
on
such
lines
that
it
would
form
a
valuable
food
supply
without
diminishing
the
value
of
the
forests
just
now
the
american
people
are
sorely
puzzled
by
a
remarkable
elk
problem
that
each
winter
is
presented
for
solution
in
the
jackson
hole
country
wyoming
driven
southward
by
the
deep
snows
of
winter
the
elk
thousands
that
in
summer
graze

grow
fat
in
the
yellowstone

march
down
into

to
find
in

less
snow
and
more
food
now
it
happens
that
the
best

for
the

information
that
it

it
gives
a
clear
and
comprehensive
account
of
last
operations
by
the
government
and
by
the
state
of

in
capturing
and
shipping

from
the
yellowstone
park
herd
for
the
double
purpose
of
diminishing
the
elk
surplus
in
the

and
stocking
vacant

elsewhere
the
operations
were
conducted
on
the
same
basis
as
the
shipping
of

the

the
open

the

dr
shore
states
that
the
undertaking
was
really
no
more
difficult
than
the
shipping
of

cattle
but
the
presence
of
a
considerable
proportion
of
young
and
tender
calves
such
as
are
never
handled
with
beef
cattle
led
to

of

the
deaths
and
the
percentage
are
nothing
at
which
to
be
surprised
when
it
is
remembered
that
the

had
just

it
is
a
principle
in
that
sires
should
be
fully
adult
of
maximum
strength
and
in
the
prime
of
life
no
stockbreeder
in
his
senses
ever
thinks
of
breeding
from
a
youthful
immature
sire
the
result
would
be
weak
offspring
not
up
to
the
standard
this
inexorable
law
of
inheritance
and
transmission
is
just
as
much
a
law
for
the
elk
moose
and
deer
of
north
america
as
it
is
for
domestic
cattle
and
horses
if
the
present
conditions
in
the
wyoming
elk
herds
continue
to
prevail
for
several
generations
as
sure
as
time
goes
on
we
shall
see
a
marked
deterioration
in
the
size
and
antlers
of
the
elk
if
the
foundation
principles
of
are
correct
then
it
is
impossible
to
maintain
any
species
at
its
zenith
of
size
strength
and
virility
by
continuous
breeding
of
the
young
and
immature
males
by
some
sportsmen
it
is
believed
that
through
killing
of
the
finest
and
largest
males
the
red
deer
of
europe
have
been
growing
smaller
but
on
that
point
i
am
not
prepared
to
offer
evidence
in
regard
to
the
of
the
elk
herds
in
large
open
parks
and
preserves
throughout
north
america
there
are
positively
ill
effects
to
wild
animals
that
are
confined
generation
after
generation
are
bound
to
deteriorate
physically
but
with
healthy
wild
animals
living
in
large
open
ranges
feeding
and
breeding
naturally
the
that
occurs
produces
no
deterioration
in
the
twin
certainties
of
and
deterioration
from
excessive
killing
of
the
good
sires
we
have
to
face
two
new
problems
of
very
decided
importance
nothing
short
of
very
radical
measures
will
provide
a
remedy
for
the
immediate
future
i
can
offer
a
solution
while
it
seems
almost
impossible
deliberately
to
kill
females
i
think
that
the
present
is
a
very
exceptional
case
and
one
that
compels
us
to
apply
the
painful
remedy
that
i
now
propose
there
are
at
present
breeding
cows
in
the
yellowstone
herds
there
are
far
too
few
good
breeding
bulls
for
five
years
entirely
prohibit
the
killing
of
adult
male
elk
and
kill
only
females
and
young
males
this
would
gradually
diminish
the
number
of
calves
born
each
year
by
about
and
by
the
end
of
five
years
it
would
reduce
the
number
the
annual
of
females
to
a
figure
sufficiently
limited
that
the
herds
could
be
maintained
on
existing
ranges
at
the
end
of
five
years
stop
killing
females
and
kill
only
males
this
plan
would
permit
a
large
number
of
bull
elk
to
mature
and
then
the
largest
and
strongest
animals
would
do
the
breeding
just
as
nature
always
intends
shall
be
done
south

and
like
all

in

you

out

about
ten

more
will
see
the
extinction
of

in
the
wake
of
the
recently
exterminated
mexican
sheep
of
the

in

solemnly
warned
the

at

the

expressed
much
concern
it
is
a
great
pity
that
just
now
political
conditions
are
completely
estopping
protection
in
mexico
but
it
is
true
if
the
code
of
proposed
laws
that
i
drew
up
by
request
in
and
submitted
to
minister
molina
were
adopted
it
would
have
a
good
effect
on
the
fauna
of

in

there
is
little
hoofed
game
to
kill

the
groups
seven

eight
species
the
desert
mule
deer
the
brocket
the
antelope
the
mountain

the

will
not
so
easily
be
exterminated
but
the
antelope
and
sheep
will
be
utterly
destroyed
they
will
be
the
first
to
go
and
i
think
they
can
not
by
any
possibility
last
longer
than
ten
years
is
it
not
too
bad
that
mexico
should
permit
her
finest
species
of
hoofed
and
horned
game
to
be
obliterated
before
she
awakens
to
the
desirability
of
conservation
the
mexicans
could
protect
their
small
stock
of
big
game
if
they
would
but
in
lower
california
they
are
leasing
huge
tracts
of
land
to
cattle
companies
and
they
permit
the
lessees
to
kill
all
the
wild
game
they
please
on
their
leased
lands
even
with
the
aid
of
dogs
this

the
greed
and
rapacity
of
civilized
man
has
completed
the
loot
and
ruin
of
the
continent
of

the

will
be
the
last
species
of
our
big

to

its
mental
traits
its

its

the
best
fitted

it
neither

nor
bugles
to
attract
its
enemies
it
can
not
be
called
to
a
sportsman
like
the
moose
and
it
sticks
to
its
timber
with
rare
and
commendable
closeness
when
it
sees
a
strange
living
thing
walking
erect
it
does
not
stop
to
stare
and
catch
bullets
but
dashes
away
in
quest
of
solitude
the
worst
shooting
that
i
ever
did
or
saw
done
at

was
at
running
deer
in
the

river
bottoms
for
the
reasons
given
the

and
persists
in
a
hundred
united
states
localities
from
which
all
other
big
game
save
the
black
bear
have
been
exterminated
for
example
in
our
adirondacks
the
moose
were
exterminated
years
and
years
ago
but
the
beloved
wilderness
called
the
north

still
is
populated
by
about
deer
and
about
are
killed
annually
the

of

are
sufficiently
numerous
that
in
a
total
of
were
killed
with
some
assistance
from
the
thin
sprinkling
of
moose
and
caribou
the
deer
of
maine
annually
draw
into
that
state
for
permanent
dedication
a
huge
sum
of
money
variously
estimated
at
from
to
in
spite
of
heavy
slaughter
and
vigorous
attempts
at
extermination
by
the
deer
of
northern
michigan
obstinately
refuse
to
be
wiped
out
there
is
however
a
large
group
of
states
in
which
this

has
been
exterminated
the
states
comprising
it

and
adjacent

of

other
states
as
if
to
shame
the
people
of

a
curious
deer
episode
is
recorded
in
cuppy
of
avoca
iowa
purchased
five
deer
and
placed
them
in
a
paddock
on
his
farm
by
they
had
increased
to
head
and
then
one
night
some
one
kindly
opened
the
gate
of
their
enclosure
and
gave
them
the
freedom
of
the
city
cuppy
made
no
effort
to
capture
them
possibly
because
they
decided
to
annex
his
farm
as
their
habitat
when
a
neighbor
led
them
with
a
bait
of
corn
to
their
owner
door
he
declined
to
impound
them
on
the
ground
that
it
was
unnecessary
by
those
deer
had
increased
to
and
the
portion
of
this
story
that
no
one
will
believe
is
this
they
spread
all
through
the
suburbs
and
hinterland
farms
of
avoca
and
people
not
only
failed
to
assassinate
all
of
them
and
eat
them
but
they
actually
killed
only
a
few
protected
the
rest
and
made
pets
of
many
queer
people
those
men
and
boys
of
avoca
nearly
everywhere
else
in
the
world
that
i
know
that
history
would
have
been
ended
differently
here
in
the
east
per
cent
of
our
people
are
like
the
avocans
but
the
other
per
cent
think
only
of
slaying
and
eating
sans
mercy
sans
decency
sans
law
now
the
state
of
iowa
has
taken
hold
to
capture
some
of
those
deer
and
set
them
free
in
other
portions
of
the
state
elsewhere
i
shall
note
the
quick
and
thorough
success
with
which
the
deer
has
been
brought
back
in
vermont
massachusetts
connecticut
and
southern
new
york
no
state
having
waste
lands
covered
with
brush
or
timber
need
be
without
the
ubiquitous
deer
give
them
a
semblance
of
a
fair
show
and
they
will
live
and
breed
with
surprising
fecundity
and
persistence
if
you
start
a
park
herd
with
ten
does
soon
you
will
have
more
deer
than
you
will
know
how
to
dispose
of
unless
you
market
them
under
a
bayne
law
duly
tagged
by
the
state
in
close
confinement
this
species
fares
rather
poorly
in
large
preserves
it
does
well
but
during
the
rutting
season
the
bucks
are
to
be
dreaded
and
those
that
develop
aggressive
traits
should
be
shot
and
marketed
this
is
the
only
way
in
which
the
deer
parks
of
england
are
kept
safe
for
unarmed
people

the

have
caused
a
great
migration
of
deer
into
those
regions
in
fact
right
down
to
the

this
will
be
the
first
member
of
the
deer
family
to
become
extinct
in
north
america
outside
of
the
protected
portions
of
its
haunts
its
fatal
preference
for
open
ground
and
its
habit
of
pausing
to
stare
at
the
hunter
have
been
and
to
the
end
will
be
its
undoing
possibly
there
are
now
two
of
these
deer
in
the
united
states
and
british
columbia
for
every
that
existed
forty
years
ago
but
no
more
it
is
a
deer
of
the
bad
lands
and
foothills
and
its
curiosity
is
fatal
the
number
of
sportsmen
who
have
hunted
and
killed
this
fine
animal
in
its
own
wild
and
picturesque
is
indeed
quite
small
it
has
been
exterminated
by
the
resident
hunter
and
ranchman
and
is
found
in
the
rocky
mountain
region
most
sparingly
ten
years
ago
it
seemed
right
to
hunt
the
rocky
mountain
in
northwestern
montana
because
so
many
deer
were
there
it
did
not
seem
to
spell
extermination
now
conditions
have
changed
since
last
great
slaughter
in
northwestern
montana
of
hungry
deer
the
species
has
been
so
reduced
that
it
is
no
longer
right
to
kill
mule
deer
anywhere
in
our
country
and
a
universal
close
season
for
five
years
is
the
duty
of
every
state
which
contains
that
species
the
real
deer
of
the
pacific
coast
is
to
most
sportsmen
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
the
east
actually
less
known
than
the
okapi
not
one
out
of
every
hundred
of
them
can
recognize
a
mounted
head
of
it
at
sight
it
is
a
small
understudy
of
the
big
mule
deer
and
now
painfully
limited
in
its
distribution
it
is
deer
of
california
and
western
oregon
and
it
has
been
so
ruthlessly
slaughtered
that
today
it
is
going
fast
as
conditions
stand
and
without
a
radical
change
on
the
part
of
the
people
of
the
pacific
coast
this
very
interesting
species
is
bound
to
disappear
it
will
not
be
persistent
like
the
deer
but
in
the
heavy
forests
it
will
last
much
longer
than
the
mule
deer
my
information
regarding
this
deer
is
like
the
stock
of
specimens
of
it
in
museum
collections
meager
and
unsatisfactory
we
need
to
know
in
detail
how
that
species
is
faring
and
what
its
prospects
are
for
the
immediate
future
in
i
saw
great
piles
of
skins
from
it
in
the
fur
houses
of
seattle
and
the
sight
gave
me
much
concern
the
caribou
i
think
it
is
not
very
difficult
to
forecast
the
future
of
the
genus
in
north
america
from
the
logic
of
the
conditions
of
thanks
to
the
splendid
mass
of
information
that
has
been
accumulated
regarding
this
group
we
are
able
to
draw
certain
conclusions
i
think
that
the
caribou
of
the
canadian
barren
grounds
and
northeastern
alaska
will
survive
in
great
numbers
for
at
least
another
century
that
the
caribou
herds
of
newfoundland
will
last
nearly
as
long
and
that
in
fifty
years
or
less
all
the
caribou
of
the
great
northwestern
wilderness
will
be
swept
away
the
reasons
for
these
conclusions
are
by
no
means
obscure
or
farfetched
in
the
first
place
the
caribou
are
enormously
numerous
undoubtedly
running
up
into
millions
it
can
not
be
possible
that
they
are
being
killed
faster
than
they
are
breeding
and
so
they
must
be
increasing
their
food
supply
is
unlimited
they
are
protected
by
two
redoubtable
champions
jack
frost
and
the
mosquito
their
country
never
will
contain
a
great
human
population
the
natives
are
so
few
in
number
and
so
lazy
that
even
though
they
should
become
supplied
with
modern
firearms
it
is
unlikely
that
they
ever
will
make
a
serious
impression
on
the
caribou
millions
the
only
thing
to
fear
for
the
caribou
throngs
is
disease
a
factor
that
is
beyond
human
prediction
it
is
reasonably
certain
that
the
barren
grounds
never
will
be
netted
by
railways
unless
gold
is
discovered
over
a
wide
area
the
fierce
cold
and
hunger
and
the
billions
of
mosquitoes
of
the
barren
grounds
will
protect
the
caribou
from
the
wholesale
slaughter
that
civilized
man
joyously
would
inflict
if
he
had
the
chance
the
caribou
thousands
of
newfoundland
are
fairly
accessible
to
sportsmen
and
but
at
the
same
time
the
colonial
government
can
protect
them
from
extermination
if
it
will
already
much
has
been
done
to
check
the
reckless
and
wicked
slaughter
that
once
prevailed
a
bag
limit
of
three
bull
caribou
per
annum
has
been
fixed
which
is
enforced
as
to
and
sportsmen
but
in
a
way
that
is
much
too
american
it
is
often
ignored
by
residents
in
touch
with
the
game
for
instance
the
guide
of
a
new
york
gentleman
whom
i
know
admitted
to
my
friend
that
each
year
he
killed
about
caribou
for
himself
and
his
family
of
four
other
persons
he
explained
thus
when
the
inspector
comes
around
i
show
him
two
caribou
hanging
in
my
woodshed
but
back
in
the
woods
i
have
a
little
shack
where
i
keep
the
others
until
i
want
them
the
real
sportsmen
of
the
world
never
will
make
the
slightest
perceptible
impression
on
the
caribou
of
newfoundland
for
one
thing
the
hunting
is
much
too
tame
to
be
interesting
if
the
caribou
of
that
island
ever
are
exterminated
it
will
be
strictly
by
the
people
of
newfoundland
themselves
if
the
government
will
tighten
its
grip
on
the
herds
they
need
never
be
exterminated
the
caribou
of
new
brunswick
quebec
and
ontario
are
few
and
widely
scattered
unless
carefully
conserved
they
are
not
likely
to
last
long
for
their
country
is
annually
penetrated
in
every
direction
by
armed
men
white
and
red
there
is
no
means
by
which
it
can
be
proven
but
from
the
number
of
armed
men
in
those
regions
i
feel
sure
that
the
typical
woodland
caribou
species
is
being
shot
faster
than
it
is
breeding
the
sportsmen
and
naturalists
of
canada
and
new
brunswick
would
render
good
service
by
making
a
close
and
careful
investigation
of
that
question
the
caribou
of
the
northwestern
wilderness
are
in
a
situation
peculiarly
their
own
they
inhabit
a
region
of
naked
mountains
and
forests
wherein
they
are
conspicuous
easily
stalked
and
easily
killed
nowhere
do
they
exist
in
large
herds
of
thousands
or
even
of
many
hundreds
they
live
in
small
bands
of
from
ten
to
twenty
head
and
even
those
are
far
apart
the
region
in
which
they
live
is
certain
to
be
thoroughly
opened
up
by
railways
and
exploited
fifty
years
from
now
we
will
find
every
portion
of
the
northwest
fairly
accessible
by
rail
the
building
of
the
railways
will
be
to
the
caribou
and
to
other
big
game
the
day
of
doom
in
that
wild
rough
region
no
power
on
earth
save
that
which
might
be
able
to
deprive
the
inhabitants
and
all
visitors
of
firearms
can
possibly
save
the
game
outside
of
a
few
preserves
that
are
diligently
patroled
the
big
game
of
the
northwest
region
in
which
i
include
the
interior
of
alaska
it
is
only
a
question
of
time
already
the
building
of
the
city
of
fairbanks
and
the
exploitation
of
the
mining
districts
surrounding
it
have
led
to
such
harassment
and
slaughter
of
the
migrating
caribou
that
the
great
herd
which
formerly
traversed
the
tanana
country
once
a
year
has
completely
changed
its
migration
route
and
now
keeps
much
farther
north
the
crossing
of
the
yukon
near
eagle
city
has
been
abandoned
a
hundred
years
hence
the
northwestern
wilderness
will
be
dotted
with
towns
and
with
railways
but
the
big
game
of
it
will
be
gone
except
in
the
preserves
that
are
yet
to
be
made
this
will
particularly
involve
the
caribou
moose
and
mountain
sheep
of
all
species
which
will
be
the
first
to
go
the
mountain
goat
and
the
forest
bears
will
hold
out
longer
than
their
more
exposed
neighbors
of
the
treeless
mountains
the
in
the
united
states
the
moose
is
found
in
five
states
maine
minnesota
montana
wyoming
and
idaho
there
are
in
the
yellowstone
park
in
maine
and
minnesota
only
may
moose
be
hunted
and
killed
in
the
season
of
moose
were
killed
in
maine
a
large
number
considering
the
small
moose
population
of
that
state
in
northern
minnesota
we
now
possess
a
great
national
moose
preserve
of
acres
and
in
fullerton
after
a
personal
inspection
in
which
he
saw
moose
in
nine
days
estimated
the
total
moose
population
of
the
present
day
at
head
this
is
a
moose
preserve
worth
while
outside
of
protected
areas
the
moose
is
the
animal
that
is
most
easily
exterminated
its
trail
is
easily
followed
and
its
habits
are
thoroughly
known
down
to
three
decimal
places
as
a
hunter
reward
it
is
great
strange
to
say
new
brunswick
has
found
that
the
moose
is
an
animal
that
it
is
possible
and
even
easy
to
protect
the
death
of
a
moose
is
an
event
that
is
not
easily
concealed
wherever
it
is
thoroughly
understood
that
the
moose
law
will
be
enforced
the
poacher
pauses
to
consider
the
net
results
to
him
of
a
jail
sentence
in
new
brunswick
we
have
seen
two
strange
things
happen
during
our
own
times
we
have
seen
the
moose
migrate
into
and
permanently
occupy
an
extensive
area
that
previously
was
destitute
of
that
species
at
the
same
time
we
have
seen
a
reasonable
number
of
bull
moose
killed
by
sportsmen
without
disturbing
in
the
least
the
general
equanimity
of
the
general
moose
population
and
at
this
moment
the
moose
population
of
new
brunswick
is
almost
incredible
every
moose
hunter
who
goes
there
sees
from
to
moose
and
two
of
my
friends
last
year
saw
in
round
numbers
about
up
to
date
the
size
of
adult
antlers
seem
to
be
maintaining
a
high
standard
in
summer
the
photographing
of
moose
in
the
rivers
lakes
and
ponds
of
maine
and
new
brunswick
amounts
to
an
industry
i
am
uneasy
about
the
constant
picking
off
of
the
largest
and
best
breeding
bulls
of
the
mirimachi
country
lest
it
finally
reduce
the
size
and
antlers
of
the
moose
of
that
region
but
only
the
future
can
tell
us
just
how
that
prospect
stands
in
alaska
our
ever
thoughtful
and
forehanded
biological
survey
of
the
department
of
agriculture
has
by
legal
proclamation
at
one
stroke
converted
the
whole
of
the
kenai
peninsula
into
a
magnificent
moose
preserve
this
will
save
the
giant
moose
of
alaska
from
extermination
and
new
brunswick
and
the
minnesota
preserve
will
save
but
in
the
northwest
we
can
positively
depend
upon
it
that
eventually
wherever
the
moose
may
legally
be
hunted
and
killed
by
any
tom
dick
or
harry
who
can
afford
a
rifle
and
a
license
the
moose
surely
will
disappear
the
moose
laws
of
alaska
are
strict
toward
sportsmen
only
the
miners
prospectors
and
indians
may
kill
as
many
as
they
please
for
food
purposes
this
opens
the
door
to
a
great
amount
of
unfair
slaughter
any
can
put
a
pan
and
pick
into
his
hunting
outfit
go
out
after
moose
and
call
himself
a
prospector
i
grant
that
the
prospector
who
is
looking
for
ores
and
minerals
with
an
intelligent
eye
and
knows
what
he
is
doing
should
have
special
privileges
on
game
to
keep
him
from
starving
the
settled
miner
however
is
in
a
different
class
no
miner
should
ask
the
privilege
of
living
on
wild
game
any
more
than
should
the
farmer
the
steamboat
man
the
railway
laborer
or
the
soldier
in
an
army
post
the
indian
should
have
no
game
advantages
whatever
over
a
white
man
he
does
not
own
the
game
of
a
region
any
more
than
he
owns
its
minerals
or
its
he
should
obey
the
general
game
laws
just
the
same
as
white
men
in
africa
as
far
as
possible
the
white
population
wisely
prohibits
the
natives
from
owning
or
using
firearms
and
a
good
idea
it
is
too
i
am
glad
there
is
one
continent
on
which
the
nightmare
does
not
curse
the
whole
land
the
now
that
the
north
pole
has
been
safely
discovered
and
the
south
pole
has
become
the
of
polar
exploration
the
harried
herds
of
the
farthest
north
are
having
a
rest
i
think
that
most
american
sportsmen
have
learned
that
as
a
sporting
proposition
there
is
about
as
much
fun
and
glory
in
harrying
a
herd
with
dogs
and
picking
off
the
members
of
it
at
parade
rest
as
there
is
in
shooting
range
cattle
in
a
the
habits
of
the
animal
positively
eliminate
the
real
essence
of
sport
difficulty
and
danger
when
a
band
is
chased
by
dogs
or
by
wolves
the
members
of
it
bulls
and
cows
alike
instantly
form
a
close
circle
around
the
calves
facing
outward
shoulder
to
shoulder
and
stand
at
bay
without
the
aid
of
a
gunner
and
a
rifle
such
a
formation
is
invincible
paul
rainey
moving
pictures
tell
a
wonderful
story
of
animal
intelligence
bravery
and
devotion
to
the
parental
instinct
for
some
reason
the
herds
do
not
seem
to
have
perceptibly
increased
since
man
first
encountered
them
the
number
alive
appears
to
be
no
greater
than
it
was
fifty
years
ago
and
this
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
the
present
delicate
balance
could
easily
be
disturbed
the
wrong
way
fortunately
it
seems
reasonably
certain
that
the
indians
of
the
canadian
barren
grounds
the
eskimo
of
the
far
north
and
the
stray
explorers
all
live
outside
the
haunts
of
the
species
and
come
in
touch
only
with
the
edge
of
the
population
as
a
whole
this
leads
us
to
hope
and
believe
that
through
the
difficulties
involved
in
reaching
them
the
main
bodies
of
of
both
species
are
safe
from
extermination
at
the
same
time
the
time
has
come
for
canada
the
united
states
and
denmark
to
join
in
formulating
a
stiff
law
for
the
prevention
of
wholesale
slaughter
of
for
sport
it
should
be
rendered
impossible
for
another
sportsman
to
kill
head
in
one
day
as
once
occurred
give
the
sportsman
a
bag
of
three
bulls
and
no
more
to
this
no
true
sportsman
will
object
and
the
objections
of
only
serve
to
confirm
the
justice
of
the
thing
they
oppose
the
grizzly
to
many
persons
it
may
seem
strange
that
anyone
should
feel
disposed
to
accord
protection
to
such
fierce
predatory
animals
as
grizzly
bears
lions
and
tigers
but
the
spirit
of
fair
play
springs
eternal
in
some
human
breasts
the
sportsmen
of
the
world
do
not
stick
at
using
repeating
rifles
on
big
game
but
they
draw
the
line
this
side
of
traps
poisons
and
extermination
the
sportsmen
of
india
once
thought
for
about
a
year
and
a
day
that
it
was
permissible
to
kill
troublesome
and
expensive
tigers
by
poison
sanderson
tried
it
and
when
his
strychnine
operations
promptly
developed
three
bloated
and
disgusting
tiger
carcasses
even
his
native
followers
revolted
at
the
principle
that
was
the
alpha
and
omega
of
sanderson
poisoning
activities
i
am
quite
sure
that
if
the
extermination
of
the
tiger
from
the
whole
of
india
were
possible
and
the
or
were
put
to
a
vote
of
the
sportsmen
of
india
the
answer
would
be
a
thundering
no
says
major
in
his
animal
life
in
africa
it
is
impossible
to
contemplate
the
use
against
the
lion
of
any
other
weapon
than
the
rifle
the
real
sportsmen
and
naturalists
of
america
are
decidedly
opposed
to
the
extermination
of
the
grizzly
bear
they
feel
that
the
wilds
of
north
america
are
wide
enough
for
the
accommodation
of
many
grizzlies
without
crowding
the
proletariat
a
rocky
mountain
without
a
grizzly
upon
it
or
at
least
a
bear
of
some
kind
is
only
half
a
mountain
commonplace
and
tame
put
one
grizzly
cub
upon
it
and
presto
every
cubic
yard
of
its
local
atmosphere
reeks
with
romantic
uncertainty
and
fearsome
thrills
a
few
persons
have
done
considerable
talking
and
writing
about
the
damage
to
stock
inflicted
by
bears
but
i
think
there
is
little
justification
for
such
charges
certainly
there
is
not
enough
real
damage
done
by
bears
to
justify
their
extermination
at
the
present
time
we
hear
that
the
farmers
of
kadiak
island
alaska
are
being
seriously
harassed
and
damaged
by
the
big
kadiak
bear
an
animal
so
rare
and
shy
that
it
is
very
difficult
for
a
sportsman
to
kill
one
i
think
the
charges
against
the
bears
if
the
kadiak
islanders
ever
really
have
made
any
need
to
be
proven
by
the
production
of
real
evidence
in
the
united
states
outside
of
our
game
preserves
i
know
of
not
one
locality
in
which
grizzly
bears
are
sufficiently
numerous
to
justify
a
sportsman
in
going
out
to
hunt
them
the
california
grizzly
once
represented
by
monarch
in
golden
gate
park
is
almost
if
not
wholly
extinct
in
montana
outside
of
glacier
park
it
is
useless
to
apply
for
wild
grizzlies
in
the
bitter
root
mountains
and
clearwater
mountains
of
idaho
there
are
grizzlies
but
they
hide
so
effectually
under
the
willows
on
the
slides
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
get
a
shot
northwestern
wyoming
still
contains
a
few
grizzlies
but
there
are
so
many
square
miles
of
mountains
around
each
animal
it
is
now
almost
useless
to
go
hunting
for
them
british
columbia
western
alberta
and
the
coast
mountains
at
least
as
far
as
skaguay
and
yukon
territory
generally
all
contain
grizzlies
and
the
sportsman
who
goes
out
for
sheep
caribou
and
moose
is
reasonably
certain
to
see
half
a
dozen
bears
and
kill
at
least
one
or
two
in
those
countries
the
grizzly
species
will
hold
forth
long
after
all
killable
grizzlies
have
vanished
from
the
united
states
i
think
that
it
is
now
time
for
california
montana
washington
oregon
idaho
and
wyoming
to
give
grizzly
bears
protection
of
some
sort
possibly
the
situation
in
those
states
calls
for
a
close
season
even
british
columbia
should
now
place
a
bag
limit
on
this
species
this
has
seemed
clear
to
me
ever
since
two
of
my
friends
killed
in
the
spring
of
grizzlies
in
one
week
but
provincial
game
warden
bryan
williams
says
that
at
present
it
would
be
impossible
to
impose
a
bag
limit
of
one
per
year
on
the
grizzlies
of
british
columbia
and
williams
is
a
sincere
the
brown
bears
of
these
magnificent
monsters
present
a
perplexing
problem
which
i
am
inclined
to
believe
can
be
satisfactorily
solved
by
the
biological
survey
only
in
short
periods
say
of
three
or
four
years
each

the

problem
does
not
in

ninety
odd

the

of

have
little
value

as
curiosities
nailed
upon
the
wall
where
they
can
not
be
stepped
upon

injured
the
of

however
is
a
business
for
men

it
is
partly
for
that
reason
they
should
be
preserved

would
be
quite
safe

there
is
some
dissatisfaction
over
the
protection
accorded
the
big
brown
bears
but
those
rules
are
right
far
as
they
a
governor
of
alaska
once
said
to
me
the
preservation
of
the
game
of
alaska
should
be
left
to
the
of
alaska
it
is
their
game
and
they
will
preserve
it
all
right
the
answer
by
a
long
only
three
things
were
wrong
with
the
view
the
game
of
alaska
does
belong
to
the
people
who
live
in
alaska
with
the
intent
to
get
out
it
belongs
to
the
people
of
the
nation
the
preservation
of
the
alaskan
fauna
on
the
public
domain
should
not
be
left
unreservedly
to
the
people
of
alaska
because
as
sure
as
shooting
they
will
preserve
it
congress
is
right
in
appropriating
for
game
protection
in
alaska
it
is
very
necessary
that
the
regulations
for
conserving
the
wild
life
should
be
fixed
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture
with
the
advice
of
the
biological
survey
the
black
bear
is
an
interesting
citizen
he
harms
nobody
nor
anything
he
affords
good
sport
he
objects
to
being
exterminated
and
wherever
in
north
america
he
is
threatened
with
extermination
he
should
at
once
be
given
protection
a
black
bear
the
is
harmless
in
captivity
posed
as
a
household
pet
he
is
decidedly
dangerous
and
had
best
be
given
the
middle
of
the
road
in
big
forests
he
is
a
grand
stayer
and
will
not
be
exterminated
from
the

of
the

states
until
washington
is
wrecked
by
anarchists
the
american
i
regard
the
american
bison
species
as
now
reasonably
secure
against
extermination
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
it
breeds
persistently
and
successfully
in
captivity
and
to
the
great
efforts
that
have
been

the
present
and

of

game
thanks
to
the
diligence
with
which
sportsmen
and
field
naturalists
have
recorded
their
observations
in
the
haunts
of
big
game
it
is
not
at
all
difficult
to
forecast
the
immediate
future
of
the
big
game
of
the
world
we
may
safely
assume
that
all
lands
well
suited
to
agriculture
mining
and
grazing
will
become
populated
by
men
with
the
usual
result
to
the
wild
mammals
and
birds
at
the
same
time
the

of
the
open

everywhere
is
thinly
distributed
and
easily
exterminated
on
the
other
hand
the
unconquerable
forest
jungles
of
certain
portions
of
the
tropics
will
hold
their
own
and
shelter
their
inhabitants
for
centuries
to
come
on
the
open
mountains
of
the
world
and
on
the
grazing
lands
most
big
game
is
now
being
killed
much
faster
than
it
breeds
this
is
due
to
the
attacks
of
five
times
too
many
hunters
open
seasons
that
are
too
long
and
bag
limits
that
are
far
too
liberal
as
an
example
consider
africa
viewed
in
any
way
it
may
be
taken
the

in

is

settlers

arthur
jordan
has
seen
much
of
the
big

of
british
east
africa
and
its
killing
him
i
asked
to
tell
me
how
long
in
his
opinion
the
big
game
of
that
territory
will
last
outside
of
the
game
preserves
as
it
is
now
being
killed
he
said
oh
it
will
last
a
long
time
i
think
it
will
last
fifteen
years
years
and
this
for
the
richest
fauna
of
any
one
spot
in
the
whole
world
which
nature
has
been
million
years
in
developing
and
placing
at
present
the
marvelous
herds
of
big
game
of
british
east
africa
and
uganda
constitute
the
grandest
zoological
spectacle
that
the
world
ever
has
seen
in
historic
times
for
such
an
area
the
number
of
species
is
incredible
and
until
they
are
seen
the
thronging
masses
of
individuals
are
beyond
conception
it
is
easy
to
say
a
herd
of
zebras
but
no
mere
words
can
give
an
adequate
impression
of
the
actual
army
of
stripes
and
bars
and
hoofs
thundering
in
review
over
a
grassy
plain
but
the
settlers
say
the
zebras
must
go
they
break
through
our
best
wire
fences
ruin
our
crops
despoil
us
of
the
fruits
of
long
and
toilsome
efforts
and
much
expenditure
we
simply
can
not
live
in
a
country
inhabited
by
herds
of
wild
zebras
and
really
their
contention
is
well
founded
when
it
is
necessary
to
choose
between
wild
animals
and
peaceful
agriculture
for
millions
of
men
the
animals
must
give
way
in
those
portions
of
the
great
east
african
plateau
region
that
are
suited
to
modern
agriculture
stretching
from
buluwayo
to
northern
uganda
the
wild
herds
are
doomed
to
be
crowded
out
by
the
farmer
and
the
this
is
the
inevitable
result
of
civilization
and
progress
in
wild
lands
marauding
battalions
of
zebras
bellicose
rhinoceroses
and
murderous
buffaloes
do
not
fit
in
with
ranches
and
crops
and
children
going
to
school
except
in
the
great
game
preserves
the
swamps
and
the
dense
jungles
it
is
certain
that
the
big
game
of
the
whole
of
eastern
africa
is
foredoomed
to
disappear
the
largest
and
most
valuable
species
first
five
hundred
years
from
now
when
north
america
is
worn
out
and
wasted

a
skeleton

what
it
now
is
the
great

with

population
giraffes
and
rhinoceroses
now
are
trampling
over
the
sites
of
the
cities
and
universities
of
the
future
then
the
herds
of

that
now
make
africa
a

will
exist
only
in

from
an
article
in
the

of

for

adams
and
based
largely
upon
the
exhaustive
studies
of
engel
of
copenhagen
from
what
has
befallen
in
south
africa
we
can
easily
and
correctly
forecast
the
future
of
the
big
game
of
british
east
africa
and
uganda
less
than
fifty
years
ago
cape
colony
natal
zululand
and
every
country
up
to
the
zambesi
was
teeming
with
herds
of
big
wild
animals
just
as
the
northern
provinces
now
are
as
late
as
when
rhodesia
was
taken
over
by
the
chartered
company
and
the
capital
city
of
salisbury
was
staked
out
an
american
boy
in
the
pioneer
corps
now
honorable
william
harvey
brown
of
salisbury
wrote
thus
of
the
gwibi
flats
near
salisbury
that
evening
i
beheld
on
those
flats
a
sight
which
probably
will
never
again
be
seen
there
to
the
end
of
the
world
the
variety
deploying
before
me
was
almost
incredible
there
within
the
range
of
my
vision
were
groups
of
roan
sable
and
tsessebi
antelopes
burchell
zebras
now
totally
extinct
elands
reedbucks
steinbucks
and
ostriches
it
was
like
africa
in
the
days
of
livingstone
as
i
sat
on
my
horse
viewing
with
amazement
this
wonderful
panorama
of
wild
life
i
was
startled
by
a
herd
that
came
galloping
around
a
small
hill
just
behind
me
the
south
african
p
that
was
in
and
how
is
it
salisbury
is
a
modern
city
endorsed
by
two
lines
of
railway
the
gwibi
flats
are
farms
there
is
some
big
game
yet
in
rhodesia
south
of
the
zambesi
but
to
find
it
you
must
go
at
least
a
week
journey
from
the
capital
to
the
remote
corners
that
have
not
yet
been
converted
into
farms
or
mining
settlements
north
of
the
zambesi
rhodesia
yet
contains
plenty
of
big
game
the
victoria
falls
station
is
a
popular
starting
point
for
hunting
expeditions
headed
northeast
and
northwest
in
the
northwest
the
game
is
yet
quite
in
a
state
of
nature
unfortunately
the
barotse
natives
of
that
region
can
procure
from
the
portuguese
traders
all
the
firearms
and
ammunition
that
they
can
pay
for
and
by
treaty
they
retain
their
hunting
rights
the
final
result
will
be
extermination
of
the
game
elsewhere
throughout
rhodesia
the
natives
are
not
permitted
to
have
guns
and
gunpowder
a
very
wise
regulation
in
alaska
our
indians
are
privileged
to
kill
game
all
the
year
round
and
they
have
modern
firearms
with
which
to
do
it
and
how
is
it
with
the
game
of
that
day
the
true
burchell
zebra
is
now
regarded
as
in
cape
colony
and
natal
that
once
teemed
with
big
game
in
the
african
way
they
are
the
individual
wild
animals
that
also
they
are
making
game
preserves
literally
everywhere
now
that
the
best
remaining
game
districts
of
africa
are
rapidly
coming
under
british
control
it
is
a
satisfaction
to
observe
that
the
governing
bodies
and
executive
officers
are
alive
to
the
necessity
of
preserving
the
big
game
from
actual
extinction
excepting
german
east
africa
from
uganda
to
cape
colony
the
game
preserves
form
an
almost
continuous
chain
it
is
quite
impossible
to
enumerate
all
of
them
but
the
two
in
british
east
africa
are
of
enormous
size
and
are
well
stocked
with
game
south
africa
contains
a
great
many
smaller
preserves
and
a
few
specimen
herds
of
big

but
that
is
about
all
except
in
a
few
localities
the
hunting
of

in
that
region
is
done
forever

suggest
just
one
thing
a
universal
close

throughout

and
no
hunting
whatever
for
ten
years
and
yet
what
do
we
see
the
report
from
which
the
above
census
was
taken
contains
half
a
column
of
solid
matter
in
small
type
giving
a
list
of
the
all
over
cape
colony
during
which
killing

so
it
seems
that
the
spirit
of
slaughter
is
the
same
in
africa
that
it
is
in
america
as
long
as
there
is
alive
to
kill
this
list
is
of
startling
interest
because
it
shows
how
closely
the

big
game
are
now
marked
down
in

africa
in
view
of
the
success
with
which
englishmen
protect
their
game
when
once
they
have
made
up
their
minds
to
do
so
it
is
fair
to
expect
that
the
herds
now
under
protection
as
listed
above
will
save
their
respective
species
from
extinction
it
is
alarming
however
to
note
the
wide
territory
covered
by
the
deadly
open
seasons
and
to
wonder
when
the
bars
really
will
be
put
up

off

beyond

once
the

was
found
in

but
never
again
in

elands
and
zebras
are
nearly
as
great
a

as
they
are

for
the
discovery
of
white
rhinoceroses
in
the
lado
district
on

western

we
would
now
be
saying
that
is
within
about
ten
specimens
of

extinction
from

as
far
up

of

who
doubts

scan
the
census
of
wild
animals
still
living
in
cape
colony
from
all
the
other
regions
of
africa
that
are
easily
accessible
to
gunners
the
animal
life
is
vigorously
being
shot
out
and
no
man
in
his
senses
will
now
say
that
the
big
game
is
breeding
faster
than
it
is
being
killed
the
reverse
is
painfully
true
carl
akeley
in
his
quest
for
a
really
large
male
elephant
for
the
american
museum
found
and
looked
over
males
without
finding
one
that
was
really
fine
and
typical
all
the
photographs
of
elephant
herds
that
were
taken
by
kermit
roosevelt
and
akeley
show
a
striking
absence
of
adult
males
and
of
females
with
long
tusks
there
are
only
young
males
and
young
females
with
small
short
tusks
the
answer
is
the
white
ivory
hunters
have
killed
nearly
all
the
elephants
bearing
good
ivory
the
slaughter
of
big
game
is
going
on
furiously
in
british
east
africa
because
the
uganda
railway
opens
up
the
entire
territory
to
hunters
anyone
man
or
woman
who
can
raise
in
cash
can
go
there
and
make
a
huge
bag
of
big
game
with
a
license
costing
only
he
can
kill
enough
big
game
to
sink
a
ship
the
bag
limit
in
british
east
africa
is
ruinously
extravagant
if
the
government
desires
the
extermination
of
the
game
such
a
bag
limit
surely
will
promote
that
end
it
is
awful
to
think
that
for
a
petty
sum
any
man
may
buy
the
right
to
kill
of
hoofed
and
horned
animals
of
species
not
counting
the
carnivorous
animals
that
also
may
be
killed
that
bag
limit
should
be
reduced
per
as
matters
stand
in
british
east
africa
the
big
game
of
the
country
outside
the
three
preserves
is
absolutely
certain
to
disappear
in
about
of
the
time
that
it
took
south
africa
to
accomplish
the
same
result
the
reasons
are
obvious
superior
accessibility
more
deadly
rifles
expert
professional
guides
and
a
widespread
craze
for
killing
big
game
with
care
and
economy
british
east
africa
should
furnish
good
hunting
for
two
centuries
but
as
things
are
going
on
twenty
years
will
see
a
tremendous
change
for
the
worse
and
a
disappearance
of
game
that
will
literally
astonish
the
natives
german
east
africa
and
uganda
will
not
exterminate
their
quotas
of
big
game
quite
so
soon
the
absence
of
railways
is
a
great
factor

to
thinking
of

as
a
vast
gloomy
and
impenetrable

there
is
in
africa
a
vast

the

well

you
who

of
the

of
these
species
will
read
of
their
total
disappearance
so
long
as
the
hunting
of
them
is
permitted
their
ultimate
disappearance
is
fixed
and
certain
it
is
not
the
way
of
english
colonists
to
permit
herds
of
big

to
run
about
merely
to
be
looked
at
naturally
the
open
plains
of
africa
and
the
thin
forests
of
the

will
be
the
first

lose

wherever

become

it

the

be

and

of

after
a
successful
survival
of
man
influence
through
two
thousand
years
at
last
the
big
game
of
india
has
made
a
good
start
on
the
road
to
vanishment
up
to
it
had
held
its
own
with
a
tenacity
that
was
astonishing
in
i
found
the
ganges
jumna
dooab
the
animallai
hills
the
wynaad
forest
and
ceylon
literally
teeming
with
herds
of
game
the
animallais
in
particular
were
a
hunter
paradise
in
each
day
of
hunting
large
game
of
some
kind
was
a
certainty
the
nilgiri
hills
had
been
quite
well
shot
out
but
in
view
of
the
very
small
area
and
open
character
of
the
whole
top
of
that
wonderful
sky
plateau
that
was
no
cause
for
wonderment
in
those
days
no
native
shikaree
owned
and
operated
a
gun
or
at
the
most
very
very
few
of
them
did
if
a
rogue
elephant
a
tiger
or
a
nasty
leopard
became
a
public
nuisance
it
was
a
case
for
a
sahib
to
come
and
doctor
it
with
a
express
rifle
worth
or
more
and
the
sahibs
had
shooting
galore
i
think
that
no
such
great
sights
as
those
of
the
plateau
regions
of
africa
ever
were
seen
in
southern
asia
conditions
there
are
different
and
usually
the
game
is
widely
scattered
the
sambar
deer
and
muntjac
of
the
dense
forests
the
axis
of
the
bamboo
glades
the
thameng
deer
of
the
burmese
jungles
the
sladang
or
gaur
of
the
awful
malay
tangle
and
the
big
cats
and
canines
will
last
long
and
well
the
ibexes
markhors
tahr
and
all
the
wild
sheep
eventually
will
be
shot
out
by
sportsmen
who
are
sheep
crazy
the
sheep
and
goats
of
asia
will
disappear
soon
after
the
plains
animals
of
africa
because
no
big
game
that
lives
in
the
open
can
much
longer
endure
the
modern
inexpensive
rifles
of
deadly
accuracy
and
limitless
repetition
of
fire
eventually
i
fear
that
by
some
unlucky
turn
of
fortune
wheel
all
the
native
hunters
of
asia
will
obtain
rifles
and
when
they
do
we
soon
will
see
the
end
of
the
big
game
even
we
find
that
the
primitive
conditions
of
have
been
greatly
changed
in
the
first
place
about
every
native
shikaree
hunter
owns
a
rifle
at
a
cost
of
about
and
many
other
natives
possess
guns
and
assume
to
hunt
with
them
the
logical
conclusion
of
this
is
more
hunting
and
less
game
the
development
of
the
country
has
reduced
the
cover
for
game
new
roads
and
railways
have
made
the
game
districts
easily
accessible
and
real
sportsmen
are
now
three
or
four
times
as
numerous
as
they
were
in
at
toonacadavoo
in
the
animallai
hills
where
years
ago
there
modestly
nestled
on
the
ridge
beside
the
river
only
forest
ranger
theobold
bungalow
built
of
mud
and
covered
with
grass
thatch
and
bamboo
rats
there
is
now
a
regular
hill
station
lighted
by
electricity
a
modern
sanatorium
high
up
on
the
bluff
a
golf
links
and
other
modern
improvements
in
my
day
there
were
exactly
four
guns
on
the
animallais
now
there
are
probably
one
hundred
and
it
is
easy
to
guess
how
much
big
game
remains
on
the
delectable
mountains
in
comparison
with
the
golden
days
of
i
should
say
that
there
is
now
only
one
game
animal
for
every
that
were
there
in
my
day
i
am
told
that
it
is
like
that
all
over
india
beyond
question
the
and
have
been
busy
there
as
everywhere
else
the
game
of
india
is
on
the
toboggan
slide
and
the
old
days
of
abundance
have
gone
forever
the
first
fact
that
strikes
us
in
the
face
is
the
impending
fate
of
the
great
indian
rhinoceros
an
animal
as
wonderful
as
the
titanothere
or
the
megatherium
it
is
like
a
gift
handed
down
to
us
straight
out
of
the
pleistocene
age
a
million
years
back
the
british
paleontologists
marvel
at
and
by
great
labor
dig
his
bones
out
of
the
sewalik
rocks
but
what
one
of
them
all
has
yet
made
a
move
to
save
from
the
quick
extermination
that
soon
will
be
his
portion
unless
he
is
accorded
perpetual
and
real
protection
from
the
assaults
of
man
let
the
mammalogists
of
the
world
face
this
fact
the
available
cover
of
the
indian
rhinoceros
is
decreasing
throughout
assam
and
bengal
where
the
behemoth
of
the
jungle
has
a
right
to
live
it
is
believed
that
the
few
remaining
rhinos
are
being
shot
much
faster
then
they
are
breeding
and
what
will
be
the
effect
of
this
upon
an
animal
that
requires
fourteen
years
to
reach
full
maturity
the
most
wonderful
hoofed
mammal
of
all
asia
is
booked
for
extermination
and
unless
very
radical
measures
for
its
preservation
are
at
once
carried
into
effect
it
is
probable
that
twenty
years
more
will
see
the
last
indian
rhino
go
down
to
rise
no
more
one
remedy
would
be
a
good
ample
rhinoceros
preserve
and
another
the
most
absolute
and
permanent
protection
for
the
species
all
along
the
line
measures
will
not
suffice
it
is
time
to
ring
in
a
general
alarm
during
the
past
eighteen
years
only
three
specimens
of
that
species
have
come
out
of
india
for
the
zoological
gardens
and
parks
of
the
world
and
i
think
there
are
only
five
in
captivity
all
told
we
are
told
that
in
india
now
the
natives
are
permitted
to
have
about
all
the
firearms
they
can
pay
for
naturally
in
a
country
containing
over
people
this
is
a
deadly
thing
of
course
there
are
shooting
regulations
many
of
them
but
their
enforcement
is
so
imperfect
that
it
is
said
that
the
natives
are
attacking
the
big
game
on
all
sides
with
deadly
effect
i
fear
it
is
utterly
impossible
for
the
indian
government
to
put
enough
wardens
into
the
field
to
watch
the
doings
of
the
grand
army
of
native
poachers
fortunately
the
indian
native
unlike
the
western
frontiersman
does
not
contend
that
the
big
game
or
that
all
men
are
born
free
and
equal
at
the
same
time
he
means
to
have
his
full
share
of
it
to
eat
and
to
sell
in
various
forms
for
cash
even
in
india
the
dragon
has
reared
its
head
and
is
in
need
of
being
scotched
with
an
iron
hand
when
i
received
direct
from
a
friend
in
the
native
state
of
kashmir
a
long
printed
circular
setting
forth
the
hunting
laws
and
measures
of
that
very
interesting
principality
it
gave
me
a
shock
it
was
disquieting
to
be
thus
assured
that
the
big
game
of
kashmir
has
disappeared
to
such
an
extent
that
strong
protective
measures
are
necessary
it
was
as
if
the
chief
eskimo
of
etah
had
issued
a
strong
proclamation
for
the
saving
of
the
in
kashmir
the
destruction
of
game
has
become
so
serious
that
a
game
preservation
department
has
been
created
with
the
official
staff
that
such
an
organization
requires
the
game
laws
are
printed
annually
and
any
variations
from
them
may
be
made
only
by
the
authority
of
the
maharajah
himself
up
to
date
game
preserves
have
been
created
having
a
total
area
of
about
thee
hundred
square
miles
in
addition
to
these
there
are
twelve
small
preserves
each
having
an
area
of
from
to
fifty
square
miles
by
their
locations
these
seem
to
provide
for
all
the
species
of
big
game
that
are
found
in
kashmir
the
ibex
two
forms
of
markhor
the
tahr
himalayan
bighorn
sheep
burrhel
and
goral
in
our
country
we
have
several
states
that
are
very
large
very
diversified
in
surface
and
still
inhabited
by
large
game
has
any
one
of
those
states
created
a
series
of
game
preserves
even
half
way
comparable
with
those
of
kashmir
i
think
not
montana
has
made
a
beginning
with
two
preserves
snow
creek
and
the
pryor
mountains
but
beside
the
splendid
series
of
kashmir
they
are
not
worthy
of
serious
mention
and
then
following
closely
in
the
wake
of
that
document
came
a
lengthy
article
in
the
proceedings
of
the
zoological
society
of
london
by
stebbing
in
which
a
correspondent
of
the
indian
clearly
sets
forth
the
fact
that
the
big
game
of
the
himalayas
now
is
menaced
by
a
peril
new
to
our
consideration
but
of
a
most
deadly
character
hear
him
in
this
inventory
of
game
destroyers
in
india
the
gurkha
soldier
does
not
find
a
place
for
he
belongs
to
a
class
which
he
amply
fills
by
himself
with
his
small
but
very
important
personality
he
deserves
separate
notice
from
the
banks
of
the
sarda
on
the
frontier
of
nepal
to
the
banks
of
the
indus
the
battalions
of
these
gallant
little
men
are
scattered
in
cantonments
all
along
the
outer
spurs
of
the
himalayan
range
in
seven
or
eight
of
these
locations
there
are
at
least
of
these
disciplined
warriors
who
in
the
absence
of
opportunities
for
spilling
human
blood
legitimately
are
given
a
free
hand
for
slaughtering
wild
animals
along
miles
of
the
best
hunting
grounds
of
upper
india
now
since
those
facts
must
be
true
as
reported
do
they
not
in
themselves
constitute
a
severe
arraignment
of
the
indian
government
why
should
that
state
of
game
slaughter
endure
when
a
single
executive
order
to
the
of
each
post
would
effectually
stop
it
in
the
making
of
game
preserves
or
sanctuaries
as
they
are
called
out
there
the
government
of
india
has
shown
rare
and
commendable
diligence
the
total
number
is
too
great
for
enumeration
here
the
native
state
of
mysore
has
seven
and
the
nilgiri
hills
have
sanctuaries
aggregating
about
acres
in
area
in
the
wynaad
forest
my
old
at
mudumallay
have
been
closed
to
bison
shooting
because
of
the
alarming
decrease
of
bison
gaur
through
shooting
and
disease
the
kundah
forest
reserve
has
been
made
a
partial
game
preserve
but
the
door
might
as
well
have
been
left
wide
open
as
so
widely
ajar
in
eastern
bengal
and
assam
several
game
preserves
have
been
created
on
the
whole
by
the
diligence
and
thoroughness
with
which
sanctuaries
as
they
are
termed
have
been
created
quite
generally
throughout
india
it
is
quite
evident
that
the
government
and
the
sportsmen
of
india
have
become
thoroughly
alarmed
by
the
great
decrease
of
the
game
and
the
danger
of
the
extermination
of
species
in
the
past
india
has
been
the
finest
and
of
all
asia
quite
beyond
compare
and
the
destruction
of
her
fauna
of
big
game
would
be
a
zoological
calamity
as
yet
tibet
offers
free
hunting
without
legal
let
or
hindrance
to
every
sportsman
who
can
climb
up
to
her
lofty

plateau

man
who
hunts
the
superb
creature
though
it
be
pays
in
full
for
his
trophies
the
ibex
of
the
south
help
out
the
compensatory
damages
but
even
with
that
the
list
of
species
available
in
southern
tibet
is
painfully
small
the

can
be
reached
from
china
via

after
a
long
hard

over

mason

the

of

sheep
species
whose
horns
must
be
seen
to
be
believed
through
a
quest
for
that
species
the
russian
military
authorities
played
upon
george
harrison
and
his
comrade
a
very
grim
and
unsportsmanlike
joke
at
the
frontier
military
post
on
the
border
the
two
americans
were
courteously
halted
hospitably
entertained
and
from
going
into
the
mountains
that
loomed
up
before
them
only
a
few
miles
away
the
russian
officers
said
sheep
why
if
you
really
want
sheep
we
will
send
out
some
of
our
brave
soldiers
to
shoot
some
for
you
but
there
is
no
need
for
to
take
the
trouble
to
go
after
them
after
harrison
and
his
comrade
had
spent
and
traveled
half
way
around
the
world
for
those
sheep
that
is
in
brief
the
story
of
how
the
cup
of
tantalus
was
given
them
by
the
russians
actually
their
as
those
russian
officers
were
the
champions
of
the
world
seven
hundred
miles
southeastward
of
the
altai
mountains
of
western
china
guarded
by
the
dangerous
hostility
of
savage
native
tribes
there
exists
and
awaits
the
scientific
explorer
according
to
report
an
undiscovered
wild
horse
the
bicolored
wild
horse
is
black
and
white
and
joy
awaits
the
zoologist
or
sportsman
who
sees
it
first
evidently
it
will
not
soon
be
exterminated
by
modern
rifles
impenetrable
although
the
mountains
of
central
asia
will
in
time
be
cleared
of
their
big
game
when
by
hook
and
by
crook
the
natives
secure
plenty
of
modern
firearms
there
are
places
in
the
far
east
that
we
know
will
contain
big
game
forever
and
a
day
take
the
malay
peninsula
borneo
and
sumatra
as
examples
william
beebe
who
recently
has
visited
the
far
east
has
described
how
the
state
of
selangor
between
malacca
and
penang
has
taken
on
many
airs
of
improvement
since
and
sections
of
sarawak
territory
are
being
cut
down
and
burned
for
the
growing
of
rubber
despite
this
i
am
trying
to
think
that
those
developments
menace
the
total
volume
of
the
wild
life
of
those
regions
but
little
i
wonder
if
those
tangled
illimitable
jungles
yet
know
that
their
faces
have
been
scratched
white
men
never
will
exterminate
the
big
game
of
the
really
dense
jungles
of
the
eastern
tropics
but
with
enough
axes
snares
guns
and
cartridges
may
be
able
to
accomplish
it
in
malayana
there
are
some
jungles
so
dense
so
tangled
with
lianas
and
so
thorny
with
livistonias
and
rattan
that
nothing
larger
than
a
cat
can
make
way
through
them
there
are
thousands
of
square
miles
so
boggy
so
swampy
so
dark
gloomy
and
that
all
men
fear
them
and
avoid
them
and
in
them
rubber
culture
must
be
impossible
in
those
silent
places
the
gaur
the
rhino
the
malay
sambar
the
clouded
leopard
and
the
surely
are
measurably
safe
from
the
and
market
gunners
of
the
shooting
world
it
is
good
to
think
that
there
is
an
equatorial
belt
of
jungle
clear
around
the
world
in
central
and
south
america
as
well
as
in
the
old
world
in
which
there
will
be
little
extermination
in
our
day
except
of
birds
for
the
feather
market
but
the
open
plains
open
mountains
and
open
forests
of
asia
and
australasia
are
in
different
case
eventually
they
will
be
shot
out
china
all
save
yunnan
and
western
mongolia
is
now
horribly
barren
of
wild
life
can
it
ever
be
brought
back
we
think
it
can
not
the
millions
of
population
are
too
many
and
except
in
the
great
forest
tracts
the
spread
of
modern
firearms
will
make
an
end
of
the
game
already
the
pheasants
are
being
swept
out
of
china
for
the
london
market
and
extinction
is
staring
several
species
in
the
face
on
the
whole
the
pheasants
of
the
old
world
are
being
hit
hard
by
the
craze
beebe
declares
that
owing
to
the
inrush
of
aggressive
capital
the
haunts
of
many
species
of
pheasants
are
being
denuded
of
all
their
natural
cover
and
some
mountain
species
that
are
limited
to
small
areas
are
practically
certain
to
be
exterminated
at
an
early
date
destruction
of

in
the

the

kamchatka

safe
from
the
iron
heel
of
the
a
glance
at
the
list
of
furs
sold
in
london
last
year
reveals
one
or
two
things
that
are
disquieting
the
total
catch
of
furs
for
the
year
is
enormous
considering
the
great
scarcity
of
wild
life
on
two
continents
incidentally
it
must
be
remembered
that
every
trapper
carries
a
gun
and
in
studying
the
fur
list
one
needs
no
help
in
trying
to
imagine
the
havoc
wrought
with
firearms
on
the
edible
wild
life
of
the
regions
that
contributed
all
that
fur

have
been

the
observations
which
furnished

by

in

borneo
and
java
for
the
purpose
of
studying
in

all
the
members
of
the

family
inhabiting

results
of
these
studies
and
collections

very
complete
monograph
of
the

xiii
treating
of
the
extermination
of
birds
for
hats
hornaday
has
dealt
fully
with
the
feather
and
plumage
traffic
after
it
enters
the
brokers
hands
and
has
proved
conclusively
that
the
plumes
of
egrets
are
gathered
from
the
freshly
killed
birds
we
may
trace
the
course
of
the
plumes
and
feathers
backward
through
the
bales
and
boxes
in
the
holds
of
the
vessels
to
the
ports
of
the
savage
lands
whence
they
were
shipped
then
to
the
skilful
dark
hands
of
mexican
peon
venezuelan
indian
african
negro
or
asiatic
chinaman
or
malay
who
stripped
the
skin
from
the
flesh
and
finally
to
the
jungle
or
mountain
side
or
terai
where
the
bird
gave
up
its
life
to
blowpipe
blunderbuss
or
carefully
set
snare
in
various
trips
to
mexico
venezuela
and
other
countries
in
the
tropics
of
the
new
world
i
have
seen
many
such
scenes
but
not
until
i
had
completed
a
seventeen
months
expedition
in
search
of
pheasants
through
some
twenty
wild
countries
of
asia
and
the
east
indies
did
i
realize
the
havoc
which
is
being
wrought
week
by
week
everywhere
on
the
globe
while
we
were
absent
even
these
few
months
from
the
great
centers
of
civilization
tremendous
advances
had
been
made
in
and
the
thousand
and
one
other
modern
phases
of
human
development
but
evolution
in
the
world
of
nature
as
we
observed
it
was
only
destructive
a
katabolism
a
retrogression
often
discernible
from
month
to
month
we
could
scarcely
repeat
the
trip
and
make
the
same
observations
upon
pheasants
so
rapidly
is
this
group
of
birds
approaching
extinction
the
causes
of
this
destruction
of
wild
life
are
many
and
diverse
and
resemble
one
another
only
in
that
they
all
emanate
from
mankind
to
the
casual
traveller
the
shooting
and
trapping
of
birds
for
millinery
purposes
at
first
seems
to
hold
an
insignificant
place
among
the
causes
but
this
is
only
because
in
many
of
the
larger
ports
the
protective
laws
are
more
or
less
operative
and
the
occupation
of
the
plume
hunter
is
carried
on
in
secret
ways
but
it
is
as
and
insidious
as
any
and
when
we
add
to
the
actual
number
of
birds
slain
the
compound
interest
of
eggs
grown
cold
of
young
birds
perishing
slowly
from
hunger
of
the
thousands
upon
thousands
of
birds
which
fall
wounded
or
dead
among
the
thick
tropical
jungle
foliage
and
are
lost
the
total
is
one
of
ghastly
proportions
not
to
weaken
my
argument
with
too
many
general
statements
let
me
take

concrete

in

seven
great

had
been
completely
cleared

of

had
been

in

cases
the
birds
were
either
cooked
and
eaten
at

sold

some
passing

lama
for
a

it
is
that
the

still
list
these
among

most
splendid

shame
upon
shame
when
we
read
of
impeyan
skins
dull
or
slightly
defective
we
know
that
these
are
female
birds
then
if
ever
we
realize
that
the
time
of
the
bird
and
the
beast
is
passing
the
acme
of
evolution
for
these
wonderful
beings
is
reached
and
at
most
we
can
preserve
only
a
small
fragment
of
them
to
the
millinery
hunter
what
the
egret
is
to
america
and
the
bird
of
paradise
to
new
guinea
the
impeyan
pheasant
is
to
india
the
most
coveted
of
all
plumages
there
is
a
great
tendency
to
blame
the
native
hunter
for
the
decrease
of
this
and
other
pheasants
and
from
what
i
have
personally
seen
in
many
parts
of
the
himalayas
there
is
no
question
that
the
garwhalese
and
nepalese
have
wrought
havoc
among
the
birds
but
these
men
are
by
no
means
the
sole
cause
as
long
ago
as
we
read
that
the
great
demand
for
the
brilliant
skins
of
the
moonal
that
has
existed
for
many
years
has
led
to
their
almost
total
extermination
in
some
parts
of
the
hills
as
the
native
shikaris
shoot
and
snare
for
the
pot
as
well
as
for
skins
and
kill
as
many
females
as
males
on
the
other
hand
though
for
nearly
thirty
years
my
friend
wilson
has
yearly
sent
home
from
to
skins
of
this
species
and
the
tragopan
there
are
still
in
the
woods
whence
they
were
obtained
as
many
as
if
not
more
than
when
he
first
entered
them
simply
because
he
has
rigidly
preserved
females
and
nests
and
as
amongst
english
pheasants
one
cock
suffices
for
several
hens

ignoring
the
uncertainty
of
the
last
statement
it
is
rather
absurd
to
think
of
a
single
man
preserving
females
and
nests
in
the
himalayas
from
to
when
the
british
government
despite
most
efficient
laws
and
worthy
efforts
is
unable
to
protect
the
birds
of
these
wild
regions
the
statement
that
after
thirty
to
thousand
cock
impeyans
were
shot
or
snared
as
many
or
more
than
the
original
quota
remained
could
only
emanate
from
the
mind
of
a
professional
and
hume
should
not
be
blamed
for
more
than
the
mere
repetition
of
such
figures
let
it
be
said
to
the
credit
of
wilson
the
slaughterer
of
something
near
thousand
impeyans
that
he
was
a
careful
observer
of
the
birds
habits
and
has
given
us
an
excellent
account
somewhat
coloured
by
natives
but
on
the
whole
the
best
we
have
had
in
the
past
but
it
is
not
pleasant
to
read
of
his
waiting
until
twenty
or
thirty
have
got
up
and
alighted
in
the
surrounding
trees
and
have
then
walked
up
to
the
different
trees
and
fired
at
those
i
wished
to
procure
without
alarming
the
rest

very
close
to
the

being

report
hume
opinion
that
in
there
were
scores
of
places
where
one
might
secure
from
ten
to
eighteen
birds
in
a
day
is
certainly
not
true
indeed
as
early
as
we
read
that
this
splendid
bird
once
so
abundant
on
the
western
himalayas
is
now
far
from
being
so
in
consequence
of
the
numbers
killed
by
sportsmen
on
account
of
its
beauty
whole
tracts
of
mountain
forest
once
frequented
by
the
moonal

now
almost
without

on
naively
to
tell
the
reader
that
among
the
most
pleasant
reminiscences

a
period
of
eleven

we
remember
the
intense

of

city
and
learn
from
the
records
of
the
calcutta
zoological
garden
that
impeyans
and
tragopans
are
even

the
absurdity
of
the
idea
is
apparent

of
numberless
inquiries

failed

as

to

of
fifty
years
ago
it
is
refreshing
to
find
that
at
last
sincere
efforts
are
being
made
in
british
possessions
to
stop
this
traffic
i
happened
to
be
at
rangoon
when
six
large
bales
of
pheasant
skins
were
seized
by
the
custom
officials
a
chinaman
had
brought
them
from
yunnan
via
bhamo
and
was
preparing
to
ship
them
as
ducks
feathers
two
of
the
bales
were
opened
for
my
inspection
the
first
contained
about
five
hundred
lady
amherst
pheasant
skins
falling
to
pieces
and
lacking
heads
and
legs
the
second
held
over
four
hundred
silver
pheasants
in
almost
perfect
condition
the
chief
collector
had
put
the
absolutely
prohibitive
fine
of
pounds
on
them
and
was
waiting
for
the
expiration
of
the
legal
number
of
days
before
burning
the
entire
lot
they
must
have
represented
years
of
work
in
decimating
the
pheasant
fauna
of
western
china
far
up
in
the
wilderness
of
northern
burma
and
over
the
yunnan
border
we
often
came
upon
some
of
the
most
ingenious
examples
of
native
trapping
a
system
which
we
found
repeated
in
the
malay
states
borneo
china
and
other
parts
of
the
far
east

is
built
directly
across

or

of

about
half
way
from
the
summit
to
the
lower
end
and
about
every
fifteen
feet
a
narrow
opening
is
left
over
which
a
heavy
log
is
suspended
any
creature
attempting
to
make
its
way
through
treads
upon
several
small
sticks
and
by
so
doing
springs
the
trap
and
the
claims
a
victim
when
a
country
is
systematically
strung
with
traps
such
as
these
sooner
or
later
all
but
a
pitiful
remnant
of
the
smaller
mammals
birds
and
reptiles
are
certain
to
be
wiped
out
morning
after
morning
i
have
visited
such
a
runway
and
found
dead
along
its
path
what
must
have
been
all
the
walking
running
or
crawling
creatures
which
the
night
before
had
sought
the
water
at
the
bottom
pheasants
cobras
rodents
civets
and
members
of
many
other
groups
in
some
countries
nooses
instead
of
guard
the
openings
but
the
result
is
equally
deadly
i
have
described
this
method
of
trapping
because
of
its
future
importance
in
the
destruction
of
wild
life
in
the
far
east
the
chinaman
in
all
his
many
millions
is
undergoing
a
remarkably
swift
and
radical
evolution
both
of
character
and
dress
in
many
ways
if
only
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
patient
thrifty
he
is
a
most
powerful
factor
in
the
east
and
is
becoming
more
so
in
many
cases
he
imitates
the
white
nations
by
cutting
off
his
queue
and
altering
his
dress
in
some
mysterious
correlated
way
his
diet
seems
simultaneously
affected
and
while
for
untold
generations
rice
and
fish
has
satisfied
all
his
gastronomic
desires
a
new
craving
that
for
meat
has
come
to
him
the
result
is
apparent
in
many
parts
of
the
east
the
chinaman
is
willing
and
able
to
pay
for
meat
and
the
native
finds
a
new
market
for
the
creatures
about
him
again
and
again
when
i
wished
a
few
specimens
of
some
certain
pheasant
i
had
but
to
hail
passing
canoes
and
bid
a
few
annas
or
cash
or
ringits
higher
than
the
prospective
chinese
purchaser
would
give
and
the
pheasants
were
mine
in
the
catalogues
of
the
brokers
sales
of
feathers
we
read
of
many
thousands
of
the
wonderful
ocellated
wing
feathers
of
the
argus
pheasant
but
no
less
horrible
is
the
sight
of
a
canoe
crammed
with
the
bedraggled
bodies
of
these
magnificent
birds
on
their
way
to
some
chinese
hamlet
where
they
will
be
sold
for
a
pittance
the
flesh
eaten
to
the
last
tendon
and
the
feathers
given
to
the
children
and
puppies
to
play
with
the
appetite
of
the
mongolian
will
soon
be
an
important
factor
in
the
extermination
of
animals
and
birds
few
species
being
exempt
for
the
chinaman
lives
up
to
his
reputation
and
is
not
squeamish
as
to
the
nature
of
his
meat
before
we
leave
the
subject
of
chinamen
let
us
consider
another
recent
factor
in
the
destruction
of
wild
life
which
is
at
present
widely
operative
in
china
itself
this
is
the
cold
storage
warehouse
of
which
six
or
eight
enormous
ones
have
gone
up
in
different
parts
of
the
east
to
speak
in
detail
only
of
the
one
at
hankow
six
hundred
miles
up
the
yangtze
we
found
it
to
be
the
largest
structure
in
the
city
surrounded
by
a
high
wall
with
each
entrance
and
exit
guarded
by
armed
sikhs
it
seemed
like
the
feudal
castle
of
some
medieval
baron
why
such
secrecy
is
necessary
i
could
not
learn
as
there
are
no
laws
against
its
business
but
so
carefully
guarded
is
its
premises
that
until
a
short
time
ago
even
the
british
of
hankow
had
not
been
allowed
to
enter
he
however
at
last
refused
to
sign
the
papers
for
any
more
outgoing
shipments
until
he
should
be
allowed
to
see
what
was
going
on
within
the
warehouse
i
hoped
to
be
able
to
look
over
some
of
the
frozen
pheasants
for
interesting
scientific
material
but
of
course
was
not
allowed
to
do
so
although
here
in
the
heart
of
china
outside
changes
are
not
felt
so
strongly
and
the
meat
diet
of
the
border
and
emigrant
chinese
is
hardly
apparent
these
warehouses
have
opened
up
a
new
source
of
revenue
which
has
met
with
instant
response
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
of
wild
shot
or
trapped
pheasants
and
other
birds
are
now
brought
to
these
establishments
by
the
natives
from
far
and
near
the
birds
are
frozen
and
twice
a
year
shipped
on
specially
refrigerated
and
steamships
to
england
and
the
continent
of
europe
where
they
seem
to
find
a
ready
sale
pigs
and
chickens
also
figure
in
the
shipments
now
the
pheasants
have
for
centuries
existed
in
enormous
numbers
in
the
endless
ricefields
of
china
without
doing
any
damage
to
the
crops
in
fact
they
could
not
be
present
in
such
numbers
without
being
an
important
factor
in
keeping
down
insect
and
other
enemies
of
the
grain
when
their
numbers
are
decimated
as
they
are
being
at
present
there
must
eventually
result
a
serious
upsetting
of
the
balance
of
nature
let
us
hope
that
in
some
way
this
may
be
avoided
and
that
the
present
famine
deaths
of
thirty
thousand
or
more
in
some
provinces
will
not
be
increased
many
fold
when
i
started
on
this
search
for
pheasants
i
was
repeatedly
told
by
old
explorers
in
the
east
that
my
task
would
be
very
different
from
theirs
of
thirty
years
ago
that
i
would
find
steamers
railroads
and
automobiles
where
formerly
were
only
canoes
and
jungle
i
indeed
found
this
as
reported
but
while
my
task
was
different
it
was
made
no
easier
formerly
to
be
sure
one
had
from
the
start
to
paddle
slowly
or
push
along
the
trails
made
by
natives
or
game
animals
but
then
the
wild
life
was
encountered
at
once
while
i
found
it
always
far
from
the
end
of
the
steamer
route
or
the
railroad
terminal
and
still
to
be
reached
only
by
the
most
primitive
modes
of
travel
i
cite
this
to
give
point
to
my
next
great
cause
of
destruction
the
burning
and
clearing
of
vast
stretches
of
country
for
the
planting
of
rubber
trees
the
east
seems
rubber
mad
and
whether
the
enormous
output
which
will
result
from
the
millions
of
trees
set
out
month
after
month
will
be
profitable
i
can
not
say
i
can
think
only
of
the
vanishing
of
the
and
of
many
districts
which
i
have
seen
as
a
direct
result
of
this
commercial
activity
one
leaves
port
swettenham
on
the
west
coast
of
selangor
and
for
the
hour
run
to
kuala
lumpur
sees
hardly
anything
but
vast
radiating
lines
of
spindling
rubber
trees
all
underbrush
cleared
all
native
growths
vanished
from
kuala
lumpur
to
kuala
kubu
at
the
very
foot
of
the
mountain
backbone
of
the
malay
peninsula
the
same
holds
true
and
where
some
area
appears
not
under
cultivation
the
climbing
fern
and
a
coarse
useless
lalang
grass
covers
every
inch
of
ground
one
can
hardly
imagine
a
more
complete
blotting
out
of
the
native
fauna
and
flora
of
any
one
limited
region
and
roads
for
the
increasing
motor
cars
are
widening
the
cleared
zone
mile
after
mile
to
the
north
and
south
in
this
region
as
we
pushed
on
over
the
mountains
into
the
wilderness
of
pahang
we
saw
little
of
the
actual
destruction
of
the
primeval
native
growth
but
elsewhere
it
became
a
common
sight
once
for
many
days
we
studied
the
wonderful
life
of
a
jungle
which
stretched
up
to
our
very
camp
troops
of
rollicking
or
gibbons
frequented
the
forest
squirrels
tupaias
birds
and
insects
in
myriads
were
everywhere
during
the
day
great
flying
lemurs
owls
and
other
nocturnal
creatures
made
the
evenings
and
nights
full
of
interest
and
then
one
day
without
warning
came
the
sound
of
an
ax
and
another
and
another
from
that
moment
the
songs
cries
chirps
and
roars
of
the
jungle
were
seldom
heard
from
our
camp
every
day
saw
new
phalanxes
of
splendid
primeval
trees
fallen
or
half
suspended
in
their
rigging
of
lianas
the
leaves
withered
the
flower
petals
fell
and
we
heard
no
more
the
crackling
of
bamboos
in
the
wind
then
the
pitiful
survivors
of
the
destruction
were
brought
to
us
now
a
baby
flying
lemur
flung
from
its
hole
by
the
falling
of
some
tree
young
tupaias
nestling
birds
a
few
out
of
the
thousands
of
creatures
from
insects
to
mammals
which
were
slain
so
that
a
chinaman
or
malay
might
eke
a
few
dollars
four
or
five
years
hence
from
a
grove
of
rubber
trees
i
do
not
say
it
is
wrong
man
has
won
out
and
might
is
right
as
since
the
dawn
of
creation
but
to
the
onlooker
to
the
lover
of
nature
and
the
animal
world
it
is
a
terrible
a
hopeless
thing
one
can
not
at
present
leave
the
tourist
line
of
travel
in
the
east
without
at
once
encountering
evidence
of
the
wholesale
direct
slaughter
of
wild
life
or
its
no
less
certain
extermination
by
the
elimination
of
the
haunts
and
the
food
plants
of
the
various
beasts
and
birds
chapter
xxi
the
savage
of
the
gunner
the
mental
attitude
of
the
men
who
shoot
constitutes
a
deadly
factor
in
the
destruction
of
wild
life
and
the
extermination
of
species
fully
per
cent
of
the
sportsmen
gunners
and
other
men
and
boys
who
kill
game
all
over
the
world
and
in
all
nations
regard
game
birds
and
mammals
only
as
things
to
be
killed
and
not
as
creatures
worth
preserving
for
their
beauty
or
their
interest
to
mankind
this
is
precisely
the
viewpoint
of
the
and
the
savage
and
it
has
come
down
from
the
to
the
absolutely
unchanged
save
for
one
thing
the
latter
sometimes
is
prompted
to
save
in
order
to
slaughter
the
above
statement
of
an
existing
fact
may
seem
harsh
and
some
persons
may
be
startled
by
it
but
it
is
based
on
an
acquaintance
with
thousands
of
men
who
shoot
all
kinds
of
game
all
over
the
world
my
critics
surely
will
admit
that
my
opportunities
to
meet
the
sportsmen
and
gunners
of
the
world
are
and
for
years
have
been
rather
favorable
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
the
efforts
of
the
hunters
of
my
personal
acquaintance
have
covered
about
of
the
hunting
grounds
of
the
world
if
the
estimate
that
i
have
formed
of
the
average
hunter
viewpoint
is
wrong
or
even
partially
so
i
will
be
glad
to
have
it
proven
in
order
that
i
may
reform
my
judgment
and
apologize
in
working
with
large
bodies
of
sportsmen
i
have
steadily
and
also
painfully
been
impressed
by
their
intentness
on
killing
and
by
the
fact
that
seek
to
preserve
game
only
to
kill
it
who
ever
saw
a
rise
in
a
convention
and
advocate
the
preservation
of
any
species
of
game
bird
on
account
of
its
beauty
or
its
esthetic
interest
i
never
did
and
i
have
sat
in
many
conventions
of
sportsmen
all
the
talk
is
of
open
seasons
bag
limits
and
killing
rights
the
man
who
has
the
hardihood
to
stand
up
and
propose
a
close
season
has
a
hard
row
to
hoe
men
rise
and
say
it
all
nonsense
there
plenty
of
quail
shooting
on
long
island
yet
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
america
the
ruling
passion
is
to
kill
as
long
as
anything
killable
remains
the
man
who
will
openly
advocate
the
stopping
of
because
the
quails
are
of
such
great
value
to
the
farmers
or
because
they
are
so
and
companionable
to
man
receives
no
sympathy
from
ninety
per
cent
of
the
sportsmen
the
remaining
ten
per
cent
think
seriously
about
the
matter
and
favor
long
close
seasons
it
is
my
impression
that
of
the
men
who
shoot
it
is
only
among
the
hunters
that
we
find
much
genuine
admiration
for
game
animals
or
any
feeling
remotely
resembling
regard
for
it
the
moment
that
a
majority
of
american
gunners
concede
the
fact
that
game
birds
are
worth
preserving
for
their
beauty
and
their
value
as
living
neighbors
to
man
from
that
moment
there
is
hope
for
the
saving
of
the
remnant
that
will
indeed
be
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
of
a
millennium
in
fact
in
the
preservation
of
wild
life
it
will
then
be
easy
to
enact
laws
for
close
seasons
on
whole
groups
of
species
think
what
it
would
mean
for
such
a
close
season
to
be
enacted
for
all
the
grouse
of
the
united
states
all
the
of
the
united
states
or
the
wild
turkey
wherever
found
the
great
indeed
the
opponents
of
long
close
seasons
on
game
birds
are
the
gunners
whenever
and
wherever
you
introduce
a
bill
to
provide
such
a
season
you
will
find
that
this
is
true
the
gun
clubs
and
the
downtrodden
hunters
and
anglers
protective
associations
will
be
quick
to
go
after
their
representatives
and
oppose
the
bill
and
state
senators
and
assemblymen
will
think
very
hard
and
with
strong
courage
before
they
deliberately
resolve
to
do
their
duty
regardless
of
the
opposition
of
a
large
body
of
sportsmen
men
who
have
votes
and
who
know
how
to
take
revenge
on
lawmakers
who
deprive
them
of
their
right
to
kill
the
greatest
speech
ever
made
in
the
mexican
congress
was
uttered
by
the
member
who
solemnly
said
i
rise
to
sacrifice
ambition
to
honor
unfortunately
the
men
who
shoot
have
become
possessed
of
the
idea
that
they
have
certain
inherent
rights
to
kill
game
now
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
sportsman
with
a
fox
gun
in
his
hands
a
dog
at
his
heels
and
five
bills
in
his
pocket
has
no
more
right
to
kill
a
covey
of
quail
on
long
island
than
my
milkman
has
to
elect
that
it
shall
be
let
alone
for
the
pleasure
of
his
children
the
time
has
come
when
the
people
who
shoot
must
do
one
of
two
things
they
must
demonstrate
the
fact
that
they
have
rights
in
the
wild
creatures
and
demand
their
recognition
or
see
the
killable
game
all
swept
off
the
continent
by
the
army
of
destruction
really
it
is
to
me
very
strange
that
gunners
never
care
to
save
game
birds
on
account
of
their
beauty
one
living
bob
white
on
a
fence
is
better
than
a
score
in
a
bloody
a
live
squirrel
in
a
tree
is
poetry
in
motion
but
on
the
table
a
squirrel
is
a
rodent
that
tastes
as
a
rat
smells
beside
the
ocean
a
flock
of
sandpipers
is
needed
to
complete
the
beautiful
picture
but
on
the
table
a
sandpiper
is
beneath
contempt
a
live
deer
trotting
over
a
green
meadow
waving
a
triangular
white
flag
is
a
sight
to
thrill
any
human
ganglion
but
a
deer
lying
dead
unless
it
has
an
exceptionally
fine
head
is
only
so
much
butcher
meat
one
of
the
finest
sights
i
ever
saw
in
montana
was
a
big
flock
of
sage
grouse
slowly
stalking
over
a
grassy
flat
thinly
sprinkled
with
it
was
far
more
inspiring
than
any
pile
of
dead
birds
that
i
ever
saw
i
remember
scores
of
beautiful
game
birds
that
i
have
seen
and
not
killed
but
of
all
the
game
birds
that
i
have
eaten
or
tried
to
eat
in
new
york
i
remember
with
sincere
pleasure
only
some
of
the
ancient
candidates
i
remember
for
cause
as
the
lawyers
say
illustration
one
morning
catch
of
trout
near
spokane
another
line
of
extermination
according
to
law
three
times
too
many
fish
for
one
rod
in
those
cold
mountain
streams
fish
grow
slowly
and
a
stream
is
quickly
fished
out
sportsmen
and
gunners
for
god
sake
elevate
your
viewpoint
of
the
game
of
the
world
get
out
of
the
groove
in
which
man
has
run
ever
since
the
days
of
adam
there
is
something
in
a
game
bird
over
and
above
its
pound
of
flesh
you
do
need
the
meat
any
longer
for
you
do
know
what
hunger
is
save
by
reading
of
it
try
the
and
the
camera
instead
of
the
everlasting
gun
any
fool
can
take
a
gun
and
kill
a
bird
but
it
takes
a
genius
to
photograph
one
wild
bird
and
get
a
good
one
as
hunters
the
camera
men
have
the
best
of
it
one
good
photograph
is
more
of
a
trophy
and
a
triumph
than
a
bushel
of
dead
birds
the
birds
and
mammals
now
are
literally
dying
for
help
in
the
making
of
long
close
seasons
and
in
the
real
stoppage
of
slaughter
can
you
not
hear
the
call
of
the
wild
remnant
it
is
time
for
the
people
who
do
shoot
to
call
a
halt
on
those
who
do
and
if
this
be
treason
then
let
my
enemies
make
the
most
of
it
since
the
above
was
written
i
have
read
in
the
for
april
the
views
of
a
veteran
sportsman
and
writer
emerson
hough
on
the
situation
as
it
seems
to
him
it
is
a
strong
utterance
even
though
it
reaches
a
pessimistic
and
gloomy
conclusion
which
i
do
not
share
altogether
however
its
breadth
of
view
its
general
accuracy
and
its
incisiveness
entitle
it
to
a
full
hearing
the
following
is
only
an
extract
from
a
lengthy
article
entitled
god
acre
emerson
hough
view
of
the
situation
the
truth
is
none
the
less
the
truth
because
it
is
unpleasant
to
face
there
is
no
well
posted
sportsman
in
america
no
manufacturer
of
sporting
goods
in
america
no
man
well
versed
in
american
outdoor
matters
who
does
not
know
that
we
are
at
the
evening
of
the
day
of
open
sport
in
america
our
old
ways
have
failed
all
of
them
have
failed
the
declining
fortunes
of
the
best
sportsman
journals
of
america
would
prove
that
if
proof
were
asked
our
sportsmanship
has
failed
our
game
laws
have
failed
and
we
know
they
have
failed
our
game
is
almost
gone
and
we
know
it
is
almost
gone
america
has
changed
and
we
know
that
it
has
changed
although
we
have
not
changed
with
it
the
old
america
is
done
and
it
is
gone
and
we
know
that
to
be
the
truth
the
old
order
passeth
and
we
know
that
the
new
order
must
come
soon
if
it
is
to
work
any
salvation
for
our
wild
game
and
our
life
in
the
open
in
pursuit
of
it
there
are
many
reasons
for
this
fact
these
facts
perhaps
the
greatest
lies
in
the
steady
advance
of
civilization
into
the
wilderness
the
usurpation
for
agricultural
or
industrial
use
of
many
of
the
ancient
breeding
and
feeding
places
of
the
wild
game
all
over
the
west
and
now
all
over
canada
the
plow
advances
that
one
engine
which
can
not
be
gainsaid
which
never
turns
a
backward
furrow
another
great
agency
is
the
rapid
perfection
of
transportation
all
over
the
world
take
the
late
influx
of
east
african
literature
if
there
really
were
not
access
to
that
country
we
would
not
have
this
literature
would
not
have
so
many
pictures
from
that
country
and
if
even
africa
will
soon
be
overrun
if
even
africa
soon
will
be
shot
out
what
hope
is
there
for
the
game
of
the
wholly
accessible
north
american
continent
it
is
all
too
easy
now
for
the
slaughterer
to
get
to
his
work
all
too
easy
for
him
to
transport
the
fruits
of
the
slaughter
at
the
hands
of
the
ignorant
the
unscrupulous
and
the
unsparing
our
game
has
steadily
disappeared
until
it
is
almost
gone
we
have
handled
it
in
a
wholly
greedy
unscrupulous
and
selfish
fashion
this
has
been
our
policy
as
a
nation
if
there
is
to
be
success
for
any
plan
to
remedy
this
it
must
come
from
a
few
men
able
to
think
and
plan
and
able
to
do
more
than
that
to
follow
their
plans
with
deeds
i
have
seen
the
whole
story
of
modern
american
sportsmanship
so
called
it
has
been
class
legislation
and
organized
selfishness
that
is
what
it
has
been
and
nothing
else
i
do
not
blame
country
legislators
game
dealers
farmers
for
calling
the
sportsmen
of
america
selfish
and
thoughtless
i
do
not
blame
them
for
saying
that
the
protective
measures
advanced
by
sportsmen
have
been
selfish
measures
and
looking
to
destruction
rather
than
to
protection
at
least
that
has
been
their
actual
result
i
have
no
more
reverence
for
a
sportsman
than
for
anyone
else
and
no
reverence
for
him
at
all
because
he
is
or
calls
himself
a
sportsman
he
has
got
to
be
a
man
he
has
got
to
be
a
citizen
i
have
seen
millions
of
acres
of
breeding
and
feeding
grounds
pass
under
the
drain
and
under
the
plow
in
my
own
time
so
that
the
passing
whisper
of
the
wild
fowl
wing
has
been
forgotten
there
now
for
many
years
i
have
seen
a
half
dozen
species
of
fine
game
birds
become
extinct
in
my
own
time
and
lost
forever
to
the
american
people
and
you
and
i
have
seen
one
protective
society
after
another
languidly
organized
paying
in
a
languid
dollar
or
so
per
capita
each
year
and
so
swiftly
passing
also
to
be
forgotten
we
have
seen
one
code
and
the
other
of
conflicting
and
wholly
selfish
game
laws
passed
and
seen
them
mocked
at
and
forgotten
seen
them
all
fail
as
we
all
know
we
have
seen
even
the
nation
power
under
that
ark
of
the
covenant
known
as
the
interstate
commerce
act
fail
to
stop
wholly
the
lessening
of
our
wild
game
so
rapidly
disappearing
for
so
many
reasons
we
have
seen
both
selfish
and
unselfish
sportsmen
journals
attempt
to
solve
this
problem
and
fail
to
do
so
some
of
them
were
great
and
journals
their
record
has
not
been
one
of
disgrace
although
it
has
been
one
of
defeat
for
some
of
them
really
desired
success
more
than
they
desired
dividends
these
all
of
them
bore
their
share
of
a
great
experiment
an
experiment
in
a
new
land
under
a
new
theory
of
government
a
theory
which
says
a
man
should
be
able
to
restrain
himself
and
to
govern
himself
only
by
following
their
theory
through
to
the
end
of
that
experiment
could
they
know
that
it
was
to
fail
in
one
of
its
most
vitally
interesting
and
vitally
important
phases
but
now
as
we
know
all
of
these
agencies
selfish
or
unselfish
have
failed
to
effect
the
salvation
of
american
wild
game
not
by
any
scheme
device
or
theory
not
by
any
panacea
can
the
old
days
of
america
be
brought
back
to
us
hough
views
are
entitled
to
respectful
consideration
but
on
one
vital
point
i
do
not
follow
him
i
believe
most
sincerely
in
fact
that
it
is
to
make
a
few
new
laws
which
in
addition
to
the
many
many
good
protective
laws
we
already
have
will
bring
back
the
game
just
as
fast
and
as
far
as
man
settlements
towns
railroads
mines
and
schemes
in
general
ever
can
permit
it
to
come
back
if
the
american
people
as
a
whole
elect
that
our
wild
life
shall
be
saved
and
to
a
reasonable
extent
brought
back
then
by
the
eternal
it
will
be
saved
and
brought
back
the
road
lies
straight
before
us
and
the
going
is
easy
the
mass
makes
up
its
mind
to
act
but
on
one
vital
point
hough
is
right
the
sportsman
alone
never
will
save
the
game
the
people
who
do
not
kill
must
act
independently
part
preservation
chapter

our
annual
losses
by
insects
you
take
my
life
when
you
do
take
the
means
whereby
i
live
in
no
country
in
the
world
says
marlatt
of
the
department
of
agriculture
do
insects
impose
a
heavier
tax
on
farm
products
than
in
the
united
states
these
attacks
are
based
upon
an
enormous
and
varied
annual
output
of
cereals
and
fruits
and
a
great
variety
and
number
of
trees
for
every
insect
native
and
foreign
we
seem
to
have
crops
trees
and
plant
food
galore
and
their
ravages
rob
the
and
the
in
there
were
riots
in
the
streets
of
new
york
over
the
high
cost
of
food
in
this
state
of
fact
was
made
the
subject
of
a
special
inquiry
by
the
department
of
agriculture
and
in
the
yearbook
for
the
reader
will
find
on
page
an
article
entitled
the
annual
loss
occasioned
by
destructive
insects
in
the
united
states
the
article
is
not
of
the
sensational
type
it
was
not
written
in
an
alarmist
spirit
but
from
beginning
to
end
it
is
a
calm
analysis
of
existing
facts
and
the
conclusions
that
fairly
may
be
drawn
from
them
the
opinions
of
several
experts
have
been
considered
and
quoted
and
often
their
independent
figures
are
stated
with
the
disappearance
of
our
birds
generally
and
especially
the
slaughter
of
song
and
other
birds
both
in
the
south
and
north
the
destruction
of
the
national
wealth
by
insects
forges
to
the
front
as
a
subject
of
vital
importance
the
logic
of
the
situation
is
so
simple
a
child
can
see
it
short
crops
mean
higher
prices
if
ten
per
cent
of
our
vegetable
food
supply
is
destroyed
by
insects
as
certain
as
fate
we
will
feel
it
the
increased
cost
of
i
would
like
to
place
marlatt
report
in
the
hands
of
every
man
boy
and
in
america
but
i
have
not
at
my
disposal
the
means
to
accomplish
such
a
task
i
can
not
even
print
it
here
in
full
but
the
vital
facts
can
be
stated
briefly
and
in
plain
figures
crops
and
insects
the
principal
insect
enemies
of
corn
are
the
chinch
bug
worm
bill
bug
wire
worm
or
army
worm
stalk
worm
grasshopper
and
plant
lice
in
all
a
total
of
about
fifty
important
species
several
of
these
pests
work
secretly
at
husking
time
the
wretched
that
ruins
the
terminal
quarter
or
fifth
of
an
immense
number
of
ears
is
painfully
in
evidence
the
work
insidiously
and
the
moles
and
shrews
are
supposed
to
attack
them
and
destroy
them
the
worm
is
charged
with
causing
an
annual
loss
of
two
per
cent
of
the
corn
crop
or
the
chinch
bug
another
two
per
cent
the
boll
or
two
per
cent
more
the
remaining
insect
pests
are
charged
with
two
per
cent
which
makes
eight
per
cent
in
all
or
a
total
of
lost
each
year
to
the
american
farmer
through
the
ravages
of
insects
this
is
not
evenly
distributed
but
some
areas
suffer
more
than
others
illustration
the
very
destructive
to
crops
of
all
our
cereal
crops
wheat
is
the
one
that
suffers
most
from
insects
there
are
three
insects
that
cause
to
the
wheat
industry
an
annual
loss
of
about
ten
per
cent
the
is
the
worst
and
it
is
charged
with
five
per
cent
of
the
total
loss
the
comes
next
in
order
and
occasionally
rolls
up
enormous
losses
in
the
year
that
insect
caused
to
indiana
and
ohio
alone
the
loss
of
of
wheat
and
the
total
cost
to
us
of
that
insect
in
that
year
undoubtedly
approached
did
that
affect
the
price
of
wheat
or
not
if
not
then
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
law
of
supply
and
demand
form
collectively
the
third
insect
pest
destructive
to
wheat
of
which
it
is
reported
that
the
annual
loss
occasioned
by
wheat
probably
does
not
fall
short
of
two
or
three
per
cent
of
the
crop
hay
and
forage
these
are
attacked
by
locusts
grasshoppers
army
worms
web
worms
small
grass
worms
and
leaf
hoppers
some
of
these
pests
are
so
small
and
work
so
insidiously
that
even
the
farmer
is
prone
to
overlook
their
existence
a
ten
per
cent
shrinkage
from
these
and
other
pests
in
grasses
and
forage
plants
is
a
minimum
estimate
the
great
enemies
of
the
are
the
cotton
boll
weevil
the
bollworm
and
the
leaf
worm
but
other
insects
inflict
serious
damage
in
the
loss
occasioned
by
the
boll
weevil
chiefly
in
texas
was
conservatively
estimated
by
an
expert
hunter
at
the
boll
worm
of
the
southwestern
cotton
states
has
sometimes
caused
an
annual
loss
of
or
four
per
cent
of
the
crops
in
the
states
affected
before
the
use
of
arsenical
poisons
the
leaf
worm
caused
an
annual
loss
of
from
twenty
to
thirty
million
dollars
but
of
late
years
that
total
has
been
greatly
reduced
the
insects
that
reduce
our
annual
fruit
crop
attack
every
portion
of
the
tree
and
its
product
the
woolly
aphis
attacks
the
roots
of
the
fruit
tree
the
trunk
and
limbs

preyed
upon
by
millions
of
scale
insects
and
borers
the
leaves
are
devastated
by
the

worms
canker
worms
and
tent
caterpillars
while
the
fruit
itself
is
attacked
by
the
codling
moth
curculio
and
apple
maggot
to
destroy
fruit
is
to
take
money
out
of
the
farmer
pocket
and
to
attack
and
injure
the
tree
is
like
undermining
his
house
itself
by
an
annual
expenditure
of
about
in
cash
for
spraying
apple
trees
the
destructiveness
of
the
codling
moth
and
curculio
have
been
greatly
reduced
but
that
money
is
itself
a
cash
loss
add
to
this
the
of
actual
shrinkage
in
the
apple
crop
and
the
total
annual
loss
to
our
due
to
the
codling

concrete
case
the
cotton
boll
weevil
invaded
the
united

from
mexico
in
ten
years
later
it
was
costing
the
cotton
planters
an
annual
loss
estimated
at
fifteen
million
dollars
per
year
later
on
that
loss
was
estimated
at
twenty
million
dollars
the
cotton
boll
weevil
strikes
at
the
heart
of
the
industry
by
destroying
the
boll
of
the
cotton
plant
while
the
total
loss
never
can
be
definitely
ascertained
we
know
that
it
has
amounted
to
many
millions
of
dollars
the
figure
given
above
has
been
widely
quoted
and
so
far
as
i
am
aware
never
disputed
fortunately
we
have
at
hand
a
government
publication
on
this
subject
which
gives
some
pertinent
facts
regarding
the
bird
enemies
of
the
cotton
boll
weevil
it
is
circular
no
of
the
biological
survey
department
of
agriculture
any
one
can
obtain
it
by
addressing
that
department
i
quote
the
most
important
portions
of
this
valuable
document
birds
useful
in
the
war
against
the
cotton
boll
weevil
by
henshaw
chief
of
the
biological
survey
the
main
purpose
of
this
circular
is
to
direct
the
attention
of
cotton
growers
and
others
in
the
cotton
growing
states
to
the
importance
of
birds
in
the
boll
weevil
war
to
emphasize
the
need
of
protection
for
them
and
to
suggest
means
to
increase
the
numbers
and
extend
the
range
of
certain
of
the
more
important
kinds
investigations
by
the
biological
survey
show
that
species
of
birds
eat
boll
weevils
while
some
eat
them
only
sparingly
others
eat
them
freely
and
no
fewer
than
adult
weevils
have
been
found
in
the
stomach
of
a
single
cliff
swallow
of
the
birds
known
at
the
present
time
to
feed
on
the
weevil
among
the
most
important
are
the
orioles
nighthawks
and
foremost
of
all
the
swallows
including
the
purple
martin
six
kinds
of
orioles
live
in
texas
though
but
two
inhabit
the
southern
states
generally
orioles
are
among
the
few
birds
that
evince
a
decided
preference
for
weevils
and
as
they
persistently
hunt
for
the
insects
on
the
bolls
they
fill
a
place
occupied
by
no
other
birds
they
are
protected
by
law
in
nearly
every
state
in
the
union
but
their
bright
plumage
renders
them
among
the
most
salable
of
birds
for
millinery
purposes
and
despite
protective
laws
considerable
numbers
are
still
killed
for
the
hat
trade
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
point
out
that
their
importance
as
insect
eaters
everywhere
demands
their
protection
but
more
especially
in
the
cotton
belt
the
nighthawk
or
also
renders
important
service
in
the
destruction
of
weevils
and
catches
them
on
the
wing
in
considerable
numbers
especially
during
its
migration
unfortunately
nighthawk
is
eaten
for
food
in
some
sections
of
the
south
and
considerable
numbers
are
shot
for
this
the
bird
value
for
food
however
is
infinitesimal
as
compared
with
the
service
it
renders
the
cotton
grower
and
other
agriculturists
and
every
effort
should
be
made
to
spread
broadcast
a
knowledge
of
its
usefulness
as
a
weevil
destroyer
with
a
view
to
its
complete
protection
of
all
the
birds
now
known
to
destroy
weevils
swallows

the
deadly
enemy
of

from
the
american
natural
history
as
showing
how
a
colony
of
martins
thrives
when
provided
with
sufficient
room
to
multiply
an
experiment
by
warren
jacobs
of
waynesburg
may
be
cited
the
first
year
five
pairs
were
induced
to
occupy
the
single
box
provided
and
raised
eleven
young
the
fourth
year
three
large
boxes
divided
into
rooms
contained
pairs
and
they
raised
about
young
the
colony
was
thus
nearly
three
hundred
strong
at
the
close
of
the
fourth
season
the
effect
of
this
number
of
hungry
martins
on
the
insects
infesting
the
neighborhood
may
be
imagined
from
the
standpoint
of
the
farmer
and
the
cotton
grower
swallows
are
among
the
most
useful
birds
especially
designed
by
nature
to
capture
insects
in
midair
their
powers
of
flight
and
endurance
are
unexcelled
and
in
their
own
field
they
have
no
competitors
their
peculiar
value
to
the
cotton
grower
consists
in
the
fact
that
like
the
nighthawk
they
capture
boll
weevils
when
flying
over
the
fields
which
no
other
birds
do
flycatchers
snap
up
the
weevils
near
trees
and
shrubbery
wrens
hunt
them
out
when
concealed
under
bark
or
rubbish
blackbirds
catch
them
on
the
ground
as
do
the
killdeer
titlark
meadow
lark
and
others
while
orioles
hunt
for
them
on
the
bolls
but
it
is
the
peculiar
function
of
swallows
to
catch
the
weevils
as
they
are
making
long
flights
leaving
the
cotton
fields
in
search
of
hiding
places
in
which
to
winter
or
entering
them
to
continue
their
work
of
devastation
means
have
been
taken
to
inform
residents
of
the
northern
states
of
the
value
of
the
swallow
tribe
to
agriculturists
generally
and
particularly
to
cotton
planters
in
the
belief
that
the
number
of
swallows
breeding
in
the
north
can
be
substantially
increased
the
cooperation
of
the
northern
states
is
important
since
birds
bred
in
the
north
migrate
directly
through
the
southern
states
in
the
fall
on
their
way
to
the
distant
tropics
and
also
in
the
spring
on
their
return
illustration
the
nighthawk
a
goatsucker
not
a
but
it
feeds
exclusively
upon
insects
important
as
it
is
to
increase
the
number
of
northern
breeding
swallows
it
is
still
more
important
to
increase
the
number
nesting
in
the
south
and
to
induce
the
birds
there
to
extend
their
range
over
as
much
of
the
cotton
area
as
possible
nesting
birds
spend
much
more
time
in
the
south
than
migrants
and
during
the
weeks
when
the
old
birds
are
feeding
young
they
are
almost
incessantly
engaged
in
the
pursuit
of
insects
it
is
not
of
course
claimed
that
birds
alone
can
stay
the
ravages
of
the
cotton
boll
weevil
in
texas
but
they
materially
aid
in
checking
the
advance
of
the
pest
into
the
other

states

destroying
these
insects
birds
aid
in
reducing
their
numbers
within
safe
limits
and
once
within
safe
limits
in
keeping
them
there
hence
it
is
for
the
interests
of
the
cotton
states
that
special
efforts
be
made
to
protect
and
care
for
the
species

to
increase
their
numbers

both

the

if

the
worst
case
of

was
the
slaughter
in

pittsboro
north

it
was
in

the
mayor
of

hon
bennet
nooe
was
away
from
home
and
during
a
heavy
fall
of
snow
the
robins
came
into
the
town
in
great
numbers
to
feed
upon
the
berries
of
the
cedar
trees
in
order
that
the
birds
might
be
killed
without
restriction
the
board
of
aldermen
suspended
the
ordinance
against
the
firing
of
guns
in
the
town
and
permitted
the
inhabitants
to
kill
the
robins
a
disgraceful
carnival
of
slaughter
immediately
followed
in
which
about
all
the
male
population
participated
regarding
this
mayor
nooe
later
on
wrote

hearing
of
this
on
my

i
went
to
the

told
them
that
they
and
all
others
who
were
guilty
would
have
to
be
fined
three
out
of
the
five
submitted

paid
up

they
insisted
that

be
changed

the

has
few

it
makes
a
specialty
of

of
the

of
the

compositae
and
is
especially
fond
of
the
seeds
of
ragweed
thistles
wild
lettuce
and
wild
sunflower
but
small
and
beautiful
as
this
bird
is
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
grown
men
in
america
who
would
shoot
it
and
eat
it
if
they
dared
the
hawks
and
let
no
other
state
repeat
the
error
that
once
was
made
in
pennsylvania
when
that
state
enacted
in
her
now
famous
bounty
law
in
order
to
accomplish
the
wholesale
destruction
of
her
birds
of
prey
a
law
was
passed
providing
for
the
payment
of
a
bounty
of
fifty
cents
each
for
the
scalps
of
hawks
and
owls
immediately
the
slaughter
began
in
two
years
scalps
were
brought
in
and
were
paid
out
for
them
it
was
estimated
that
the
saving
to
the
farmers
in
poultry
amounted
to
one
dollar
for
each
paid
out
in
bounties
the
awakening
came
even
more
swiftly
than
the
ornithologists
expected
by
the
end
of
two
years
from
the
passage
of
the
hawk
law
the
farmers
found
their
fields
and
orchards
thoroughly
overrun
by
destructive
rats
mice
and
insects
and
they
appealed
to
the
legislature
for
the
quick
repeal
of
the
law
with
all
possible
haste
this
was
brought
about
but
it
was
estimated
by
competent
judges
that
in
damages
to
their
crops
the
hawk
law
cost
the
people
of
pennsylvania
nothing
less
than
two
million
dollars
moral
do
make
any
laws
providing
for
the
destruction
of
hawks
and
owls
until
you
have
exact
knowledge
and
know
in
advance
what
the
results
will
be
in
the
space
at
my
disposal
for
this
subject
it
is
impossible
to
treat
our
species
of
hawks
and
owls
separately
the
reader
can
find
in
the
american
natural
history
fifteen
pages
of
text
numerous
illustrations
and
many
figures
elucidating
this
subject
unfortunately
admirable
work
on
the
hawks
and
owls
has
long
been
out
of
print
and
unobtainable
there
are
however
a
few
observations
that
must
be
recorded
here
each
bird
of
prey
is
a
balanced
equation
each
one
i
think
without
a
single
exception
does
damage
chiefly
in
the
destruction
of
valuable
wild
birds
the
value
of
the
poultry
destroyed
by
hawks
and
owls
is
very
small
in
comparison
with
their
killing
of
wild
prey
of
the
species
do
not
touch
domestic
at
the
same
time
when
a
hawk
of
any
kind
or
an
owl
sets
to
work
deliberately
and
persistently
to
clean
out
a
farmer
poultry
yard
and
is
actually
doing
it
that
farmer
is
justified
in
killing
that
bird
but
the
loss
of
a
broiler
is
not
to
be
regarded
as
justification
for
a
war
of
extermination
on
the
hawks
that
fly
individual
nuisances
can
occasionally
become
so
exasperating
as
to
justify
the
use
of
the
gun
when
scarecrows
fail
but
in
all
such
circumstances
the
greatest
judgment
and
much
forbearance
also
is
desirable
and
necessary
the
value
of
hawks
and
owls
rests
upon
their
perpetual
warfare
on
the
millions
of
destructive
rats
mice
moles
shrews
weasels
rabbits
and
english
sparrows
that
constantly
prey
upon
what
the
farmer
produces
on
this
point
a
few
illustrations
must
be
given
one
of
the
most
famous
comes
via
fisher
from
one
of
the
towers
of
the
smithsonian
buildings
and
relates
to
the
barn
owl
two
hundred
pellets
consisting
of
bones
hair
and
feathers
from
one
nesting
pair
of
these
birds
were
collected
and
found
to
contain
skulls
of
which
were
of
meadow
mice
of
house
mice
of
pine
mice
were
of
rats
of
jumping
mice
were
from
shrews
was
of
a
mole
and
a
vesper
sparrow
bird
and
noxious
mammals
compare
this
with
the
record
of
any
cat
on
earth
anything
that
the
barn
owl
wants
from
me
or
from
any
farmer
should
at
once
be
offered
to
it
on
a
silver
tray
this
bird
is
often
called
the
owl
and
it
should
be
called
the
owl
the
owl
has
practically
the
same
kind
of
a
record
as
the
barn
owl
scores
of
mice
rats
and
shrews
destroyed
and
only
an
occasional
small
bird
its
nearest
relative
the
owl
may
be
described
in
the
same
words
illustration
the
barn
owl
wonderfully
destructive
of
rats
and
mice
and
almost
never
touches
birds
the
great
horned
owl
fills
us
with
conflicting
passions
for
the
long
list
of
dead
rats
and
mice
pocket
gophers
skunks
and
weasels
to
his
credit
we
think
well
of
him
and
wish
his
prosperity
for
the
ruffed
grouse
quail
other
game
birds
domestic
poultry
squirrels
chipmunks
and
hares
that
he
kills
we
hate
him
and
would
cheerfully
wring
his
neck
wearing
gauntlets
he
does
an
unusual
amount
of
good
and
a
terrible
amount
of
harm
it
is
impossible
to
strike
a
balance
for
him
and
determine
with
mathematical
accuracy
whether
he
should
be
shot
or
permitted
to
live
at
all
events
whenever
comes
up
for
trial
we
must
give
the
feathered
devil
his
due
the
names
chicken
hawk
or
hen
hawk
as
applied
usually
refer
to
the
or
species
neither
of
these
is
really
very
destructive
to
poultry
but
both
are
very
destructive
to
mice
rats
and
other
pestiferous
creatures
both
are
large
showy
birds
not
so
very
swift
in
flight
and
rather
easy
to
approach
neither
of
them
should
be
destroyed
not
even
though
they
do
once
in
a
great
while
take
a
chicken
or
wild
bird
they
pay
for
them
four
times
over
by
alden
loring
states
that
he
once
knew
a
pair
of
hawks
to
nest
within
fifty
rods
of
a
poultry
farm
on
which
there
were
young
chickens
and
ducks
not
one
of
which
was
taken
see
the
american
natural
history
pages
hawks
that
should
be
there
are
two
small
fierce
daring
hawks
both
of
which
are
so
very
destructive
that
they
deserve
to
be
shot
whenever
possible
they
are
cooper
hawk
accipiter
and
the
hawk
they
are
closely
related
and
look
much
alike
but
the
former
has
a
rounded
tail
and
the
latter
a
square
one
in
killing
them
do
not
kill
any
other
hawk
by
and
if
you
do
not
positively
recognize
the
bird
shoot
the
goshawk
is
a
bad
one
and
so
is
the
peregrine
falcon
or
duck
hawk
both
deserve
death
but
they
are
so
rare
that
we
need
not
take
them
into
account
some
of
the
hawks
and
owls
are
very
destructive
to
and
members
of
the
grouse
family

the

included
quail
ruffed
grouse
and
pigeons
the
woodpeckers
i
these
birds
are
the
natural
guardians
of
the
trees
if
we
had
enough
of
them
our
forests
would
be
fairly
safe
from
insect
pests
of
the
six
or
seven
north
american
species
that
are
of
the
most
importance
to
our

the
downy
woodpecker
is
accorded
first
rank
it

his
food
supply
consists
of
vegetable
matter
chiefly
wild

acorns
beechnuts
and
the
seeds
of
wild

and
weeds
we
may
infer
that
about
of
his
food
in
summer
and
fall
consists
of
cultivated
fruit
and
berries
his
proportion
of
cultivated
foods
is
entirely
too
small
to
justify
any
one
in
destroying
this
species
in
view
of
the
prevalence
of
insect
pests
in
the
state
of
new
york
i
have
spent
hours
in
trying
to
devise
a
practical
plan
for
making
woodpeckers
about
ten
times
more
numerous
than
they
now
are
contributions
to
this
problem
will
be
thankfully
received
yes
we
put
out
pork
fat
and
suet
in
winter
quantities
of
it
but
i
grieve
to
say
that
in
the
zoological
park
there
is
not
more
than
one
woodpecker
for
every
ten
that
were
there
twelve
years
ago
where
have
they
gone
only
one
answer
is
possible
they
have
been
shot
and
eaten
by
the
guerrillas
of
destruction
illustration
woodpecker
a
bird
of
great
value
to
orchards
and
forests
now
rapidly
disappearing
undoubtedly
through
slaughter
as
food
surely
no
man
of
intelligence
needs
to
be
told
to
protect
woodpeckers
to
the
utmost
and
to
them
in
nail
up
fat
pork
or
large
chunks
of
suet
on
the
south
sides
of
conspicuous
trees
and
encourage
the
woodpeckers
nuthatches
chickadees
and
titmice
to
remain
in
your
woods
through
the
long
and
dreary
winter
the
english
sparrow
is
a
nuisance
and
a
pest
because
it
drives
away
from
the
house
and
the
orchard
the
house
wren
bluebird
phoebe
purple
martin
and
swallow
any
one
of
which
is
more
valuable
to
man
than
a
thousand
english
sparrows
i
never
yet
have
seen
one
of
the
pest
sparrows
catch
an
insect
but
chief
forester
merkel
says
that
he
has
seen
one
catching
and
eating
small
moths
there
is
one
place
in
the
country
where
english
sparrows
have
not
yet
come
and
whenever
they
do
appear
there
they
will
meet
a
hostile
reception
i
shall
kill
every
one
that
comes
for
the
sake
of
retaining
the
wrens
catbirds
phoebes
and
thrushes
that
now
literally
make
home
happy
for
my
family
a
good
way
to
discourage
sparrows
is
to
shoot
them
en
masse
when
they
are
feeding
on
road
refuse
such
as
the
and
other
sparrows
never
touch
persistent
destruction
of
their
nests
will
check
the
nuisance
the
shore
who
is
there
who
thinks
of
the
as
being
directly
beneficial
to
man
by
reason
of
their
food
habits
i
warrant
not
more
than
one
man
in
every
ten
thousand
we
think
of
them
only
as
possible
food
the
amount
of
actual
cash
value
benefit
that
the
confer
upon
man
through
the
destruction
of
bad
things
is
in
comparison
with
the
number
of
birds
enormous
the
department
of
agriculture
never
publishes
and
circulates
anything
that
has
already
been
published
no
matter
how
valuable
to
the
public
at
large
our
rules
are
different
because
i
know
that
many
of
the
people
of
our
country
need
the
information
i
am
going
to
reprint
here
as
an
object
lesson
and
a
warning
the
whole
of
the
biological
valuable
and
timely
circular
no
issued
april
and
written
by
mcatee
it
should
open
the
eyes
of
the
american
people
to
two
things
the
economic
value
of
these
birds
and
the
fact
that
they
are
everywhere
far
on
the
road
toward
extermination
our
vanishing
shorebirds
by
mcatee
the
term
shorebird
is
applied
to
a
group
of
and
usually
plainly
colored
birds
belonging
to
the
order
limicolae
more
than
sixty
species
of
them
occur
in
north
america
true
to
their
name
they
frequent
the
shores
of
all
bodies
of
water
large
and
small
but
many
of
them
are
equally
at
home
on
plains
and
prairies
throughout
the
eastern
united
states
shorebirds
are
fast
vanishing
while
formerly
numerous
species
swarmed
along
the
atlantic
coast
and
in
the
prairie
regions
many
of
them
have
been
so
reduced
that
extermination
seems
imminent
the
plover
or
beetlehead
which
occurred
along
the
atlantic
seaboard
in
great
numbers
years
ago
is
now
seen
only
as
a
straggler
the
golden
plover
once
exceedingly
abundant
east
of
the
great
plains
is
now
rare
vast
hordes
of
dowitchers
formerly
wintered
in
louisiana
now
they
occur
only
in
infrequent
flocks
of
a
half
dozen
or
less
the
eskimo
curlew
within
the
last
decade
has
probably
been
exterminated
and
the
other
curlews
greatly
reduced
in
fact
all
the
larger
species
of
shorebirds
have
suffered
severely
so
adverse
to
shorebirds
are
present
conditions
that
the
wonder
is
that
any
escape
in
both
fall
and
spring
they
are
shot
along
the
whole
route
of
their
migration
north
and
south
their
habit
of
decoying
readily
and
persistently
coming
back
in
flocks
to
the
decoys
again
and
again
in
spite
of
murderous
volleys
greatly
lessens
their
chances
of
escape
the
breeding
grounds
of
some
of
the
species
in
the
united
states
and
canada
have
become
greatly
restricted
by
the
extension
of
agriculture
and
their
winter
ranges
in
south
america
have
probably
been
restricted
in
the
same
way
unfortunately
shorebirds
lay
fewer
eggs
than
any
of
the
other
species
generally
termed
game
birds
they
deposit
only
three
or
four
eggs
and
hatch
only
one
brood
yearly
nor
are
they
in
any
wise
immune
from
the
great
mortality
known
to
prevail
among
the
smaller
birds
their
eggs
and
young
are
constantly
preyed
upon
during
the
breeding
season
by
crows
gulls
and
jaegers
and
the
far
northern
country
to
which
so
many
of
them
resort
to
nest
is
subject
to
sudden
cold
storms
which
kill
many
of
the
young
in
the
more
temperate
climate
of
the
united
states
small
birds
in
general
do
not
bring
up
more
than
one
young
bird
for
every
two
eggs
laid
sometimes
the
proportion
of
loss
is
much
greater
actual
count
revealing
a
destruction
of
to
per
cent
of
nests
and
eggs
shorebirds
with
sets
of
three
or
four
eggs
probably
do
not
on
the
average
rear
more
than
two
young
for
each
breeding
pair
it
is
not
surprising
therefore
that
birds
of
this
family
with
their
limited
powers
of
reproduction
melt
away
under
the
relentless
warfare
waged
upon
them
until
recent
years
shorebirds
have
had
almost
no
protection
thus
the
species
most
in
need
of
stringent
protection
have
really
had
the
least
no
useful
birds
which
lay
only
three
or
four
eggs
should
be
retained
on
the
list
of
game
birds
the
shorebirds
should
be
relieved
from
persecution
and
if
we
desire
to
save
from
extermination
a
majority
of
the
species
action
must
be
prompt
the
protection
of
shorebirds
need
not
be
based
solely
on
esthetic
or
sentimental
grounds
for
few
groups
of
birds
more
thoroughly
deserve
protection
from
an
economic
standpoint
shorebirds
perform
an
important
service
by
their
inroads
upon
mosquitoes
some
of
which
play
so
conspicuous
a
part
in
the
dissemination
of
diseases
thus
nine
species
are
known
to
feed
upon
mosquitoes
and
hundreds
of
the
larvae
or
wigglers
were
found
in
several
stomachs

the

of

three
pairs
nested
in

cutworms
and

were
their
special

after
the

could
fly
they
still
kept
at
work
in

and
showed
no
inclination
to
go
to
the
shore
until
about
august
they
and
a
flock
of
quails
just
over

wall
helped
me
wonderfully
in
the
uncultivated
parts
of

also
shorebirds
search

the

praise
these

on
the
contrary
feed
upon
many

on

must
not
be
overlooked
nor
must
we
forget
the
more
personal
debt
of
gratitude
we
owe
them
for
preying
upon
mosquitoes
they
are
the
most
important
bird
enemies
of
these
pests
known
to
us
shorebirds
have
been
hunted
until
only
a
remnant
of
their
once
vast
numbers
is
left
their
limited
powers
of
reproduction
coupled
with
the
natural
vicissitudes
of
the
breeding
period
make
their
increase
slow
and
peculiarly
expose
them
to
danger
of
extermination
in
the
way
of
protection
a
beginning
has
been
made
and
a
continuous
close
season
until
has
been
established
for
the
following
birds
the
killdeer
in
massachusetts
and
louisiana
the
upland
plover
in
massachusetts
and
vermont
and
the
piping
plover
in
massachusetts
but
considering
the
needs
and
value
of
these
birds
this
modicum
of
protection
is
small
indeed
the
species
are
not
the
only
ones
that
should
be
exempt
from
persecution
for
all
the
shorebirds
of
the
united
states
are
in
great
need
of
better
protection
they
should
be
protected
first
to
save
them
from
the
danger
of
extermination
and
second
because
of
their
economic
importance
so
great
indeed
is
their
economic
value
that
their
retention
on
the
game
list
and
their
destruction
by
sportsmen
is
a
serious
loss
to
end

and
burnt
off
is
now
a
barren
desert
and
nine
families
out
of
every
ten
which
were
renting
properties
have
been
compelled
to
leave
the
district
and
take
up
other
lands
this
is
through
the
grubs
having
eaten
out
the
grass
by
the
roots
ploughing
proved
to
be
useless
as
the
grubs
ate
out
the
grass
just
the
same
whilst
there
recently
i
was
informed
that
it
took
three
years
from
the
time
the
grubs
were
first
seen
until
to
accomplish
this
complete
devastation
in
other
words
three
years
ago
the
grubs
began
work
in
the
beautiful
country
of
green
mountains
and
running
streams
the
birds
had
all
been
ruthlessly
shot
and
destroyed
in
that
district
and
i
was
amazed
at
the
absence
of
bird
life
the
two
i
have
mentioned
have
an
area
of
about
thirty
square
miles
and
form
a
about
feet
above
sea
level
the
same
kind
of
common
sense
that
teaches
men
to
go
in
when
it
rains
and
keep
out
of
fiery
furnaces
teaches
us
that
as
a
business
proposition
it
is
to
man
interest
to
protect
the
birds
make
them
plentiful
and
keep
them
so
when
we
strike
the
birds
we
hurt
ourselves
the
protection
of
our
and
birds
is
a
cash
proposition
protect
or
pay
were
i
a
farmer
no
gun
ever
should
be
fired
on
my
premises
at
any
bird
save
the
english
sparrow
and
the
three
bad
hawks
any
man
who
would
kill
my
friend
bob
white
i
would
treat
as
an
enemy
the
man
who
would
shoot
and
eat
any
of
the
woodpeckers
or
shorebirds
that
worked
for
me
i
would
surely
molest
farmer
should
post
every
foot
of
his

cultivated
and
not
the
farmer
who
does
not
do
so
is
his
own
enemy
and
he
needs
a
guardian
at
this
stage
of
wild

extermination
it
is
impossible
to
make
our
laws
too
strict
or
too
the
remnant
of
our
birds
should
be
protected
with
clubs
and
guns
if
necessary
all
our
shore
birds
should
be
accorded
a
close
season
do
ask
the
gunners
whether
they
will
to
it

they
will
not
agree
to
it

our
duty
is
clear
to
go
ahead
and
chapter
xxiv
game
and
agriculture
and
deer
as
a
food
supply
as
a
state
and
county
asset
the
deer
contains
possibilities
that
as
yet
seem
to
be
ignored
by
the
american
people
as
a
whole
it
is
quite
time
to
consider
that
persistent
prolific
and
toothsome
animal
the
proposition
that
large
herds
of
horned
game
can
not
becomingly
roam
at
will
over
farms
and
vineyards
worth
one
hundred
dollars
per
acre
affords
little
room
for
argument
generally
speaking
there
is
but
one
country
in
the
world
that
breaks
this
universal
rule
and
that
country
is
india
on
the
plains
between
and
adjacent
to
the
ganges
and
the
jumna
for
two
thousand
years
herds
of
or
sasin
antelope
have
roamed
over
cultivated
fields
so
thickly
garnished
with
human
beings
that
the
sportsman
stands
in
hourly
peril
of
bagging
a
native
every
time
he
fires
at
an
antelope
wherever
rich
agricultural
lands
exist
the
big
game
must
give
way
those
the
bison
could
not
survive
in
iowa
eastern
nebraska
or
eastern
kansas
any
longer
than
a
shawnee
indian
would
last
on
the
bowery
it
was
foredoomed
that
the
elk
deer
bear
and
wild
turkey
should
vanish
from
the
rich
farming
regions
of
the
east
and
the
middle
west
in
british
east
africa
lions
are
being
hunted
with
dogs
and
shot
wholesale
because
they
are
a
pest
to
the
settlers
and
to
the
surviving
herds
of
big
game
at
the
same
time
the
settlers
who
are
striving
to
wrest
the
fertile
plains
of
from
the
domain
of
savagery
declare
that
the
african
buffalo
the
zebra
the
kongoni
and
the
elephant
are
public
nuisances
that
must
be
suppressed
by
the
rifle
even
the
most
ardent
friend
of
wild
life
must
admit
that
when
a
settler
has
laboriously
fenced
his
fields
and
plowed
and
sowed
only
to
have
his
whole
crop
ruined
in
one
night
by
a
herd
of
zebras
the
event
is
sufficient
to
abrade
the
nerves
of
the
party
most
in
interest
while
i
take
no
stock
in
stories
of
dozens
of
rogue
elephants
that
require
treatment
with
the
rifle
and
of
grown
men
being
imperiled
by
savage
gazelles
we
admit
that
there
are
times
when
wild
animals
can
make
nuisances
of
themselves
let
us
consider
that
subject
now
wild
animal
complaints
have
come
to
me
at
various
times
of
great
destruction
of
lambs
by
eagles
of
trout
by
blue
herons
of
crops
on
long
island
by
deer
of
pears
destroyed
by
birds
and
of
valuable
park
trees
by
beavers
that
chop
down
trees
not
wisely
but
too
well
i
do
not
however
include
in
this
category
any
cherries
eaten
by
robins
or
orioles
or
jays
for
they
are
of
too
small
importance
to
consider
in
this
court
illustration
a
food
supply
of
deer
the
killing
of
the
does
was
wrong
to
meet
the
legitimate
demands
for
the
abatement
of
unbearable
nuisances
i
recommend
the
enactment
of
a
law
similar
to
section
of
the
game
laws
of
new
york
which
provides
for
the
safe
and
legitimate
abatement
of
unbearable
wild
creatures
as
follows
section
to
take
birds
and
in
the
event
that
any
species
of
birds
protected
by
the
provisions
of
section
two
hundred
and
nineteen
of
this
article
or
quadrupeds
protected
by
law
shall
at
any
time
in
any
locality
become
destructive
of
private
or
public
property
the
commission
shall
have
power
in
its
discretion
to
direct
any
game
protector
or
issue
a
permit
to
any
citizen
of
the
state
to
take
such
species
of
birds
or
quadrupeds
and
dispose
of
the
same
in
such
manner
as
the
commission
may
provide
such
permit
shall
expire
within
four
months
after
the
date
of
issuance
this
measure
should
be
adopted
by
every
state
that
is
troubled
by
too
many
or
too
aggressive
wild
mammals
or
birds
but
to
return
to
the
subject
of
big
game
and
farming
we
do
not
complain
of
the
disappearance
of
the
bison
elk
deer
and
bear
from
the
farms
of
the
united
states
and
canada
the
passing
of
the
big
game
from
all
such
regions
follows
the
advance
of
real
civilization
just
so
surely
and
certainly
as
night
follows
day
but
this
vast
land
of
ours
is
not
wholly
composed
of
rich
agricultural
lands
not
by
any
means
there
are
millions
of
acres
of
forest
lands
good
bad
and
indifferent
worth
from
nothing
per
acre
up
to
one
hundred
dollars
or
more
there
are
millions
of
acres
of
rocky
mountains
and
hills
wholly
unsuited
to
agriculture
or
even
horticulture
there
are
other
millions
of
acres
of
arid
plains
and
arboreal
deserts
on
which
nothing
but
animals
can
live
and
thrive
the
south
contains
vast
pine
forests
and
cypress
swamps
millions
of
acres
of
them
of
which
the
average
northerner
knows
less
than
nothing
we
can
not
stop
long
enough
to
look
it
up
but
from
the
green
color
on
our
national
map
that
betokens
the
forest
reserves
and
from
our
own
personal
knowledge
of
the
deserts
swamps
barrens
and
rocks
that
we
have
seen
we
make
the
estimate
that
of
the
total
area
of
the
united
states
is
incapable
of
supporting
the
husbandman
who
depends
for
his
existence
upon
tillage
of
the
soil
people
may
talk
and
write
about
dry
farming
all
they
please
but
i
wish
to
observe
that
from
to
success
is
a
long
shot
with
many
limbs
in
the
way
when
it
rains
sufficiently
dry
farming
is
a
success
but
otherwise
it
is
not
and
we
heartily
wish
it
were
otherwise
the
logical
conclusion
of
our
land
that
is
utterly
unfit
for
agriculture
is
a
great
area
of
land
available
for
occupancy
by
valuable
wild
animals
every
year
the
people
of
the
united
states
are
wasting
uncountable
millions
of
pounds
of
venison
because
we
are
neglecting
our
opportunities
for
producing
it
practically
without
cost
imagine
for
a
moment
bestowing
upon
land
owners
the
ability
to
stock
with
and
indian
sambar
deer
all
the
wild
lands
of
the
united
states
that
are
suitable
for
those
species
and
permitting
only
bucks
over
one
year
of
age
to
be
shot
with
the
does
even
reasonably
protected
the
numerical
results
in
annual
pounds
of
good
edible
flesh
fairly
challenges
the
imagination
about
six
years
ago
worthington
deer
in
his
fenced
park
at
pennsylvania
became
so
numerous
and
so
burdensome
that
he
opened
his
fences
and
permitted
about
one
thousand
head
to
go
free
we
are
losing
each
year
a
very
large
and
valuable
asset
in
the
intangible
form
of
a
million
hardy
deer
that
we
might
have
raised
but
did
not
our
vast
domains
of
wooded
mountains
hills
and
valleys
lie
practically
untenanted
by
big
game
save
in
a
few
exceptional
spots
we
lose
because
we
are
lawless
we
lose
because
we
are
too
improvident
to
conserve
large
forms
of
wild
life
unless
we
are
compelled
to
do
so
by
the
stern
edict
of
the
law
the
the
the
conscienceless
slayers
are
everywhere
ten
per
cent
of
all
the
grown
men
now
in
the
united
states
are
poachers
thieves
and
or
else
they
are
liable
to
become
so
if
you
doubt
it
try
risking
your
new
umbrella
unprotected
in
the
next
mixed
company
of
one
hundred
men
that
you
encounter
in
such
a
situation
that
it
will
be
easy
to
get
away
with
it
we
could
raise
two
million
deer
each
year
on
our
empty
wild
lands
but
without
fences
it
would
take
half
a
million
real
on
duty
from
dawn
until
dark
to
protect
them
from
destructive
slaughter
at
present
our
land
of
liberty
contains
only
game
wardens
j
the
states
that
contain
the
greatest
areas
of
wild
lands
naturally
lack
in
population
and
in
tax
funds
and
not
one
such
state
can
afford
to
put
into
the
field
even
half
enough
salaried
game
wardens
to
really
protect
her
game
from
surreptitious
slaughter
the
surplus
of
personal
liberty
in
this
land
is
a
curse
to
the
big
game
the
average
frontiersman
never
will
admit
the
divine
right
of
kings
but
he
does
ardently
believe
in
the
divine
right
of
settlers
to
reach
out
and
take
any
of
the
products
of
nature
that
they
happen
to
fancy
footnote
j
of
this
force
there
are
only
salaried
wardens
the
most
of
those
who
serve
without

naturally
render
but
little
continuous
or
regular
service
wild
meat
as
a
food
we
hear
much
these
days
about
the
high
cost
of

but
thus
far
we
have
made
no

where
it
is

for

are

to

are
we
going
to
do
about
the

on
the
coarser
necessities
of
life
is
now
booked
to
come
down
but
what
about
the
fresh
meat
supply
i
desire
to
point
out
that
between
bangor
and
san
diego
and
from
key
west
to
bellingham
our
country
contains
millions
of
acres
of
wild
practically
uninhabited
forests
rough
and
mountains
that
could
produce
two
million
deer
each
year
without
deducting
a
year
from
the
wealth
of
the
country
i
grant
that
in
the
total
number
of
deer
that
would
be
necessary
to
produce
two
million
deer
per
annum
the
farms
situated
on
the
edges
of
forests
and
actually
within
the
forests
would
suffer
somewhat
from
the
depredations
of
those
deer
as
i
will
presently
show
by
documentary
records
every
one
of
those
individual
damages
that
exceeds
two
dollars
in
value
could
be
compensated
in
cash
and
afterward
leave
on
the
credit
side
of
the
deer
account
an
enormous
annual
balance
stop
for
a
moment
you
enterprising
and
restless
men
and
women
who
travel
all
over
the
united
states
and
think
of
the
illimitable
miles
of
unbroken
forest
that
you
have
looked
upon
from
your
pullman
windows
in
the
east
in
the
south
in
the
west
and
in
southern
canada
recall
the
wooded
mountains
of
the
appalachian
system
the
white
mountain
region
the
pine
forests
of
the
atlantic
coast
and
the
gulf
states
the
forests
of
tennessee
arkansas
and
southern
missouri
of
northern
minnesota
and
every
state
of
the
rocky
mountain
region
then
think
of
the
silent
and
untouched
forests
of
the
pacific
coast
and
tell
me
whether
you
think
five
million
deer
scattered
through
all
those
forests
would
make
any
visible
impression
upon
them
that
would
be
only
about
times
as
many
as
are
there
now
i
think
the
forests
would
not
be
over
populated
and
they
would
produce
million
killable
deer
each
last
year
deer
were
forced
down
out
of
their
hiding
places
in
the
rocky
mountains
and
were
killed
in
montana
even
the
natives
had
not
dreamed
there
were
so
many
available
and
they
were
slaughtered
not
wisely
but
too
ill
it
is
not
right
that
six
members
of
one
family
should
hog
twelve
deer
in
one
season
at
present
no
deer
supply
can
stand
such
slaughter
assuming
that
the
people
of
the
united
states
be
educated
into
the
idea
of
so
conserving
deer
that
they
could
draw
two
million
head
per
year
from
the
general
stock
what
would
it
be
worth
it
is
not
very
difficult
to
estimate
the
value
of
a
deer
when
the
whole
animal
can
be
utilized
in
various
portions
of
the
united
states
deer
vary
in
size
but
i
shall
take
all
this
into
account
and
try
to
strike
a
fair
average
in
some
sections
where
deer
are
large
and
heavy
a
buck
is
easily
worth
dollars
let
him
who
doubts
it
try
to
replace
those
generous
pounds
of
flesh
with
purchased
beef
and
mutton
and
veal
and
see
how
far
dollars
will
go
toward
it
every
man
who
is
a
householder
knows
full
well
how
little
meat
one
dollar
will
buy
at
this
time
i
think
that
throughout
the
united
states
as
a
whole
every
deer
male
or
female
contains
on
an
average
ten
dollars
worth
of
good
meat
i
know
of
one
large
preserve
which
annually
sells
its
surplus
of
deer
at
that
price
wholesale
to
dealers
and
in
new
york
city
doubtless
in
many
other
cities
also
venison
often
has
sold
in
the
market
at
one
dollar
per
pound
two
million
deer
at
each
mean
the
licenses
for
the
killing
of
two
million
deer
should
cost
one
million
men
one
dollar
each
and
that
would
pay
new
game
wardens
each
fifty
dollars
per
month
all
the
year
round
the
damages
that
would
need
to
be
paid
to
farmers
on
account
of
crops
injured
by
deer
would
be
so
small
that
each
county
could
take
care
of
its
own
cases
from
its
own
treasury
as
is
done
in
the
state
of
vermont
there
are
certain
essentials
to
the
realization
of
a
dream
of
two
million
deer
per
year
that
are
absolutely
required
they
are
neither
obscure
nor
impossible
each
state
and
each
county
proposing
to
stock
its
vacant
woods
with
deer
must
resolutely
educate
its
own
people
in
the
necessity
of
playing
fair
about
the
killing
of
deer
and
giving
every
man
and
every
deer
a
square
deal
this
is
impossible
not
as
a
general
thing
even
though
it
may
be
so
in
some
specially
lawless
communities
if
the
of
the
state
and
the
county
will
take
this
matter
seriously
in
hand
it
can
be
done
in
two
years
time
the
american
people
are
not
insensible
to
appeals
to
reason
when
those
appeals
are
made
by
their
own
home
folks
the
governors
senators
assemblymen
judges
mayors
and
justices
of
the
peace
could
they
make
a
campaign
of
education
and
appeal
that
would
result
in
the
creation
of
an
immense
volume
of
free
wild
food
in
every
state
that
possesses
wild
lands
when
the
shoe
of
necessity
pinches
the
people
hard
enough

the

if
honestly
and
intelligently
conserved
this
species
could
be
made

two
million
deer
per
annum
as
a
new
food
supply
from
the
american
natural
history
the
best
wild
animal
to
furnish
a
serious
food
supply
is
the
deer
this
is
because
of
its
persistence
and
fertility
the
elk
is
too
large
for
general
use
an
elk
carcass
can
not
be
carried
on
a
horse
it
is
impossible
to
get
a
sled
or
a
wagon
to
where
it
lies
and
so
fully
half
of
it
usually
is
wasted
the
mule
deer
is
good
for
the
rocky
mountains
and
can
live
where
the
can
not
but
it
is
easy
to
the
columbian
is
the
natural
species
for
the
forests
of
the
pacific
states
but
it
is
a
trifle
small
in
size
the
example
of
in
order
to
show
that
all
the
above
is
not
based
on
empty
theory
regarding
the
stocking
of
forests
with
deer
their
wonderful
powers
of
increase
and
the
practical
handling
of
the
damage
question
let
us
take
the
experience
and
the
fine
example
of
vermont
in
april
a
few
sportsmen
of
rutland
of
whom
the
late
henry
cheney
was
one
procured
in
the
adirondacks
thirteen
deer
six
bucks
and
seven
does
these
were
liberated
in
a
forest
six
miles
from
rutland
and
beyond
being
protected
from
slaughter
they
were
left
to
shift
for
themselves
they
increased
slowly
at
first
then
rapidly
and
by
they
had
become
so
numerous
that
it
seemed
right
to
have
a
short
annual
open
season
and
kill
a
few
from
first
to
last
many
of
those
deer
have
been
killed
contrary
to
law
in
it
was
known
that
head
were
destroyed
in
that
way
and
undoubtedly
there
were
others
that
were

the
various
counties
of
vermont
have
been
paying
farmers
for
damages
inflicted
upon
their
crops

clearly
it
is
more
just
that
counties
should
settle
these
damages
than
that
they
should
be
paid
from
the
state
treasury
because
the
counties
paying
damages
have
large
compensation
in
the
value
of
the

killed
each
year
the
hunting
appears
to
be
open
to
all
persons
who
hold
licenses
from
the
state
in
order
that
the
public
at
large
may
know
the
cost
of

system

offer
the

compiled
from

of
having
noted
the
fact
that
in
two
years
the
people
of
vermont
paid
out
in
compensation
for
damages
inflicted
by
deer
it
is
of
interest
to
determine
whether
that
money
was
wisely
expended
in
other
words
did
it
pay
we
have
seen
that
in
the
years
and
the
people
of
vermont
killed
legally
and
illegally
and
converted
to
use
deer
this
does
not
include
the
deer
killed
by
dogs
and
by
accidents
regarding
the
value
of
a
deer
it
must
be
remembered
that
much
depends
upon
the
locality
of
the
carcass
in
new
york
or
pittsburg
or
chicago
a
whole
deer
is
worth
at
wholesale
at
least
dollars
in
vermont
where
deer
are
plentiful
they
are
worth
a
less
sum
i
think
that
fifteen
dollars
would
be
a
fair
figure
at
least
low
enough
even
when
computed
at
fifteen
dollars
per
carcass
those
deer
were
worth
to
the
people
of
vermont
it
would
seem
therefore
that
the
soundness
of
vermont
policy
leaves
no
room
for
argument
and
we
hope
that
other
states
and
also
private
individuals
will
profit
by
vermont
very
successful
experiment
in
bringing
back
the
deer
to
her
forests
and
in
increasing
the
food
supply
of
her
people
killing
female
to
say
one
word
on
this
subject
which
might
by
any
possibility
be
construed
as
favoring
it
is
like
juggling
with
a
lighted
torch
over
a
barrel
of
gunpowder
already
in
pennsylvania
at
least
one
gentleman
has
appeared
anxious
to
represent
me
as
favoring
the
killing
of
does
which
in
nine
hundred
and
cases
out
of
every
thousand
i
distinctly
and
emphatically
do
not
the
slaughter
of
female
hoofed
game
animals
is
necessarily
destructive
and
reprehensible
and
not
one
man
out
of
every
ten
thousand
in
this
country
ever
will
see
the
place
and
time
wherein
the
opposite
is
true
at
present
there
are
just
two
places
in
america
and
i
think
only
two
wherein
there
exists
the
slightest
exception
on
this
point
the
state
of
vermont
is
becoming
overstocked
with
deer
and
the
females
have
in
counties
not
in
all
become
so
tame
and
destructive
in
orchards
gardens
and
farm
crops
as
to
constitute
a
great
annoyance
for
this
reason
the
experiment
is
being
made
of
permitting
does
to
be
killed
under
license
until
their
number
is
somewhat
reduced
the
first
returns
from
this
trial
have
now
come
in
from
the
county
game
wardens
of
vermont
to
the
state
game
warden
john
titcomb
i
will
quote
the
gist
of
the
opinion
of
each
the
state
commissioner
says
this
law
should
remain
in
force
at
least
until
there
is
some
indication
of
a
decrease
in
the
number
of
deer
warden
taft
addison
county
says
the
killing
of
does
i
believe
did
away
with
a
good
many
of
these
tame
deer
that
cause
most
of
the
damage
to
farmers
crops
harry
chase
bennington
county
says
the
law
is
a
good
law
and
i
sincerely
trust
it
will
not
be
repealed
warden
hayward
of
rutland
county
says
the
majority
of
the
farmers
in
this
county
are
in
favor
of
repealing
the
doe
law
a
great
many
does
and
young
deer
almost
fawns
were
killed
in
this
county
during
the
hunting
season
of
wheeler
of
rutland
county
says
have
the
doe
law
repealed
we
do
need
it
parcher
of
washington
county
finds
that
the
does
did
more
damage
to
the
crops
than
the
bucks
and
he
thinks
the
doe
law
is
a
just
one
frost
of
windham
county
judicially
concludes
that
the
law
allowing
does
to
be
killed
should
remain
in
force
one
or
two
seasons
more
parker
of
orleans
county
says
his
county
is
not
overstocked
with
deer
and
he
favors
a
special
act
for
his
county
to
protect
females
a
summary
of
the
testimony
of
the
wardens
is
easily
made
when
deer
are
too
plentiful
and
the
does
become
a
public
nuisance
too
great
to
be
endured
the
number
should
be
reduced
by
regular
shooting
in
the
open
season
but
as
soon
as
the
proper
balance
of
deer
life
has
been
restored
protect
the
does
once
more
the
pursuit
of
this
policy
is
safe
and
sane
provided
it
can
be
wrought
out
without
the
influence
of
selfishness
and
reckless
disregard
for
the
rights
of
the
next
generation
on
the
whole
its
handling
is
like
playing
with
fire
and
i
think
there
are
very
very
few
states
on
this
earth
wherein
it
would
be
wise
or
safe
to
try
it
as
a
wise
friend
once
remarked
to
me
give
some
men
a
hinch
and
they
always
try
to
take
a
hell
in
vermont
however
the
situation
is
kept
so
well
in
hand
we
may
be
sure
that
at
the
right
moment
the
law
providing
for
the
decrease
of
the
number
of
does
will
be
repealed
hippopotami
and
last
year
a
bill
was
introduced
in
the
lower
house
of
congress
proposing
to
provide
funds
for
the
introduction
into
certain
southern
states
of
various
animals
from
africa
especially
hippopotami
and
african
antelopes
the
former
were
proposed
partly
for
the
purpose
of
ridding
navigation
of
the
water
hyacinths
that
now
are
choking
many
of
the
streams
of
louisiana
and
mississippi
the
antelopes
were
to
be
acclimatized
as
a
food
supply
for
the
people
at
large
this
measure
well
illustrates
the
prevailing
disposition
of
the
american
people
to
ignore
and
destroy
their
own
valuable
natural
stock
of
wild
birds
and
mammals
and
when
they
have
completed
their
war
of
extermination
reach
out
to
foreign
countries
for
foreign
species
instead
of
preserving
the
deer
of
the
south
the
south
reaches
out
for
the
utterly
impossible
antelopes
of
africa
and
the
preposterous
hippopotamus
the
north
joyously
exterminates
her
quail
and
ruffed
grouse
and
goes
to
europe
for
the
hungarian
partridge
that
partridge
is
a
failure
here
and
i
am
glad
of
on
the
ground
that
the
exterminators
of
our
native
species
do
not
deserve
success
in
their
efforts
to
displace
our
finest
native
species
with
others
from
abroad
the
proposition
is
a
climax
of
absurdity
in
proposing
the
replacing
of
valuable
native
game
with
impossible
foreign
species
chapter
xxv
law
and
sentiment
as
factors
in
preservation
there
is
grave
danger
that
through
ignorance
of
the
true
character
of
about
per
cent
of
the
men
and
boys
who
shoot
wild
creatures
a
great
wrong
will
be
done
the
latter
let
us
not
make
a
fatal
mistake
after
more
than
thirty
years
of
observation
among
all
kinds
of
sportsmen
hunters
and
gunners
i
am
convinced
that
it
is
utterly
futile
and
deadly
dangerous
to
rely
on
humane
sentiment
to
diminish
the
slaughter
of
wild
things
by
and
in
some
respects
the
term
is
a
rude
rough
word
but
it
is
needed
in
the
english
language
and
it
has
come
to
stay
it
is
a
disagreeable
term
but
it
was
brought
into
use
to
apply
to
a
class
of
very
disagreeable
persons
a
is
a
hunter
of
game
who
knows
no
such
thing
as
sentiment
or
conscience
in
the
killing
of
game
so
long
as
he
keeps
within
the
limit
of
the
law
regardless
of
the
scarcity
of
game
or
of
its
hard
struggle
for
existence
he
will
kill
right
up
to
the
bag
limit
every
day
that
he
goes
out
provided
it
is
possible
to
do
so
he
uses
the
law
as
a
salve
for
the
spot
where
his
conscience
should
be
he
will
shoot
with
any
machine
gun
or
gun
of
big
calibre
in
every
way
that
the
law
allows
and
he
knows
no
such
thing
as
giving
the
game
a
square
deal
he
brags
of
his
big
bags
of
game
and
he
loves
to
be
photographed
with
a
of
dead
birds
as
a
background
he
believes
in
automatic
and
pump
guns
spring
shooting
longer
open
seasons
and
more
game
he
is
quite
content
to
shoot
half
tame
ducks
in
a
club
preserve
as
they
fly
between
coop
and
pond
whenever
he
secures
an
opportunity
he
will
gladly
sell
his
game
whenever
he
can
do
so
without
being
found
out
and
sometimes
when
he
is
often
a
true
sportsman
drifts
without
realizing
it
into
some
one
way
of
the
confirmed
but
the
moment
he
is
made
to
realize
his
position
he
changes
his
course
and
his
standing
the
is
impervious
to
argument
you
can
shame
a
horse
away
from
his
oats
more
easily
than
you
can
shame
him
from
doing
what
the
law
allows
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
gentlemen
and
gentlewomen
who
never
once
have
come
in
touch
with
real
who
do
not
understand
the
species
at
all
and
do
not
recognize
its
thousands
of
such
persons
will
tell
you
in
my
opinion
the
best
way
to
save
the
wild
life
is
to
the
i
have
heard
that
many
many
times
for
people
a
little
law
is
quite
sufficient
and
the
best
people
need
none
at
all
but
the
are
different
for
them
the
strict
letter
of
the
law
backed
up
by
a
squad
is
the
only
controlling
influence
that
they
recognize
to
them
it
is
necessary
to
say
you
shall
and
you
shall
not
only
yesterday
the
latest
case
was
related
to
me
by
a
from
kansas
into
a
certain
county
of
southern
kansas
from
which
the
had
been
totally
gone
for
a
dozen
years
or
more
a
pair
of
those
birds
entered
settled
down
and
nested
their
coming
was
to
many
habitants
a
joyous
event
now
said
the
people
we
will
care
for
these
birds
and
they
will
multiply
and
presently
the
county
will
be
restocked
but
ahab
came
two
men
from
another
county
calling
themselves
sportsmen
but
not
entitled
to
that
name
heard
of
those
birds
and
resolved
to
get
them
they
waited
until
the
young
were
just
leaving
the
nest
and
they
went
down
and
camped
near
by
on
the
first
day
they
killed
the
two
parent
birds
and
half
the
flock
of
young
birds
and
the
next
day
they
got
all
the
rest
but
there
is
a
sequel
to
this
story
one
of
those
men
was
a
dealer
in
guns
and
ammunition
and
when
his
customers
heard
what
he
had
done
they
simply
put
him
out
of
business
by
refusing
to
trade
with
him
any
more
he
is
now
washing
dirty
dishes
in
a
restaurant
but
at
heart
he
is
a
just
the
same
near
bridgeport
connecticut
a
gentleman
of
my
acquaintance
owns
a
fine
estate
which
is
adorned
with
a
trout
stream
and
a
superfine
trout
pond
once
he
invited
a
business
man
of
bridgeport
to
be
his
guest
and
fish
for
trout
in
his
pond
on
that
guest
during
a
visit
of
three
days
all
the
finest
forms
of
hospitality
were
bestowed
two
weeks
later
my
friend
caught
that
guest
early
on
a
sunday
morning
on
the
and
spoiled
his
carefully
arranged
in
his
book
saddle
and
camp
in

dillon
wallace
tells
a
story
of
a
man
from
new
york
who
in
the
mountains
of
colorado
deliberately
corrupted
his
guides
with
money
or
other
influences
shot
mountain
sheep
and
got
away
with
it
in
northern
minnesota
george
wood
has
been
having
a
fight
with
the
worst
community
of
and
poachers
of
which
i
have
heard
there
appears
to
be
no
game
law
that
they
do
not
systematically
violate
the
killers
seem
determined
to
annihilate
the
last
head
of
game
in
spite
of
fines
and
imprisonments
the
foreigners
are
absolutely
uncontrollable
the
latest
feature
of
the
war
is
the
discovery
of
a
tannery
in
the
woods
where
the
hides
of
deer
and
moose
are
dressed
apparently
the
only
kind
of
a
law
that
will
save
the
game
of
northern
minnesota
is
one
that
will
totally
disarm
the
entire
population
in
pennsylvania
there
exists
an
association
which
was
formed
for
the
express
purpose
of
fighting
the
state
game
commission
preventing
the
enactment
of
a
hunter
license
law
and
repealing
the
law
against
the
killing
of
female
deer
and
hornless
fawns
the
continued
existence
of
that
organization
on
that
basis
would
be
a
standing
disgrace
to
the
fair
name
of
pennsylvania
i
think
however
that
that
organization
was
founded
on
secret
selfish
purposes
and
that
ere
long
the
general
body
of
members
will
awaken
to
a
realizing
sense
of
their
position
and
range
themselves
in
support
of
the
excellent
policies
of
the
commission
a
is
a
man
or
boy
who
kills
game
as
a
business
for
the
money
that
can
be
derived
from
its
sale
or
other
use
such
men
have
the
same
feelings
as
butchers
from
their
point
of
view
they
can
see
no
reason
why
all
the
game
in
the
world
should
not
be
killed
and
marketed
like
the
they
wish
to
get
out
of
the
wild
life
all
the
money
there
is
in
it
that
is
all
left
to
themselves
with
open
markets
they
would
soon
exterminate
the
land
fauna
of
the
habitable
portions
of
the
globe
no
one
can
educate
such
people
for
the
gunners
and
there
is
no
check
save
specific
laws
that
sternly
and
amply
safeguard
the
rights
of
the
wild
creatures
that
can
not
make
laws
for
themselves
nor
can
anyone
educate
the
heartless
woman
of
fashion
who
is
determined
to
wear
aigrettes
as
long
as
her
money
can

the

women
of

have
been
on
the

they
are
already
against
the
use
of

in

the
army
of
the
defense
it
now
seems
that
the
friends
of
wild
life
who
themselves
are
not
on
the
should
be
afforded
some
definite
information
regarding
the
army
of
the
defense
and
its
strength
and
weakness
it
is
an
interesting
subject
but
the
limitations
of
space
will
not
permit
an
extended
treatment
over
the
world
at
large
i
think
the
active
destroyers
outnumber
the
active
defenders
of
wild
life
at
least
in
the
ratio
of
to
and
the
money
available
to
the
destroyers
is
to
the
funds
of
the
defenders
as
is
to
the
sportsman
cheerfully
expends
from
to
on
a
hunting
trip
but
resents
the
suggestion
that
he
should
subscribe
from
to
for
wild
life
preservation
if
he
puts
down
he
thinks
he
has
done
a
big
thing
worse
than
this
i
am
forced
to
believe
that
at
least
per
cent
of
the
sportsmen
of
the
world
never
have
contributed
one
dollar
in
money
or
one
hour
of
effort
to
that
cause
but
there
are
exceptions
and
i
can
name
at
least
fifty
sportsmen
who
have
subscribed
each
to
campaign
funds
and
some
who
have
given
as
high
as
once
i
sat
down
beside
a
financially
rich
slaughterer
of
game
and
asked
him
to
subscribe
a
sum
of
real
money
in
behalf
of
a
very
important
campaign
i
needed
funds
very
much
and
i
explained
exhorted
and
besought
i
pointed
out
his
duty
give
back
in
return
for
all
the
game
slaughter
that
he
had
for
ten
long
minutes
he
stood
fire
without
flinching
and
without
once
opening
his
lips
to
speak
he
made
no
answer
no
argument
no
defense
and
finally
he
never
gave
up
one
cent
wherever
the
english
language
is
spoken
from
tasmania
to
scotland
and
from
porto
rico
to
the
philippines
the
spirit
of
wild
life
protection
exists
elsewhere
there
is
much
more
to
be
said
on
this
point
to
all
cosmopolitan
sportsmen
the
british
blue
book
on
game
protection
the
annual
reports
of
the
two
great
protective
societies
of
london
and
the
annual
progress
report
of
the
department
of
agriculture
are
reassuring
and
comforting
it
is
good
to
know
that
uganda
maintains
a
department
of
game
protection
butler
superintendent
that
so
good
a
man
as
is
in
control
of
protection
in
the
transvaal
and
that
even
the
native
state
of
kashmir
officially
recognizes
the
need
to
protect
the
remnant
there
are
of
course
many
parts
of
the
world
in
which
game
laws
and
limits
to
slaughter
are
quite
unknown
all
of
which
is
entirely
wrong
and
in
need
of
quick
correction
no
state
or
nation
can
be
accounted
wholly
civilized
that
fails
to
recognize
the
necessity
to
protect
wild
life
i
am
tempted
to
make
a
list
of
the
states
and
nations
that
were
at
latest
advices
destitute
of
game
laws
and
game
protectors
but
i
fear
to
do
injustice
through
lack
of
the
latest
information
however
the
time
has
come
to
search
out
delinquents
and
hold
up
to
each
one
a
mirror
that
will
reflect
its
shortcomings
naturally
we
are
most
interested
in
our
own
contingent
of
the
army
of
the
defense
the
united
states
the
feeling
in
congress
toward
the
conservation
of
wild
life
and
forests
is
admirable
both
houses
are
fully
awake
to
the
necessity
of
saving
while
there
is
yet
something
to
be
saved
the
people
of
the
united
states
may
be
assured
that
the
national
government
is
active
and
sympathetic
in
the
prosecution
of
such
conservation
measures
as
it
might
justly
be
expected
to
promote
for
example
during
the
past
five
years
we
have
seen
congress
take
favorable
action
on
the
following
important
causes
nearly
every
one
of
which
cost
money
the
saving
of
the
american
bison
in
four
national
ranges
the
creation
of
bird
refuges
the
creation
of
five
great
game

the
saving
of
the
elk
in
jackson
hole
the
protection
of
the
fur
seal
the
protection
of
the
wild
life
of
alaska
there
are
many
active
friends
of
wild
life
who
confidently
expect
to
see
this
fine
list
gloriously
rounded
out
by
the
passage
in
of
an
ideal
bill
for
the
federal
protection
of
all
migratory
birds
to
name
the
friends
of
wild
life
in
congress
would
require
the
printing
of
a
list
of
at
least
two
hundred
names
and
a
history
of
the
rise
and
progress
of
wild
life
conservation
by
the
national
government
would
fill
a
volume
such
a
volume
would
be
highly
desirable
when
the
story
of
the
national
government
part
in
protection
is
finally
written
it
will
be
found
that
while
he
was
president
theodore
roosevelt
made
a
record
in
that
field
that
is
indeed
enough
to
make
a
reign
illustrious
he
aided
every
cause
that
lay
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
and
he
gave
the
vanishing
birds
and
mammals
the
benefit
of
every
doubt
he
helped
to
establish
three
national
bison
herds
four
national
game
preserves
federal
bird
refuges
and
to
enact
the
alaska
game
laws
of
and
it
was
in
that
the
national
government
elected
to
accept
its
share
of
the
white
man
burden
and
enter
actively
into
the
practical
business
of
wild
life
protection
this
special
work
originally
undertaken
and
down
to
the
present
vigorously
carried
on
by
theodore
palmer
has
considerably
changed
the
working
policy
of
the
biological
survey
of
the
department
of
agriculture
and
greatly
influenced
game
protection
throughout
the
states
the
game
protection
work
of
that
bureau
is
alone
worth
to
the
people
of
this
country
at
least
twenty
times
more
per
annum
than
the
entire
annual
cost
of
the
bureau
next
to
the
splendid
services
of
palmer
all
over
the
united
states
one
great
value
of
the
bureau
is
found
in
the
ammunition
that
it
prepares
and
distributes
for
general
use
in
assaults
on
the
citadels
of
ignorance
and
greed
the
publications
of

are

me
that
they

charged
with
the
duty
of
looking
after
the
general
welfare
of
the
game
and
other
wild
life
of
their
respective
states
theoretically
one
of
the
chief
duties
of
a
state
game
commission
is
to
initiate
new
legislative
bills
that
are
necessary
and
advocate
their
translation
into
law
the
official
standing
of
most
game
commissioners
is
such
that
they
can
successfully
do
this
in
governor
hughes
of

went
so
far
as
to
let
it
be
known
that
he
would
sign
no

that
did
not
meet
the
approval
of
state

commissioner
james
whipple
as
a
general
working
principle
and
quite
aside
from
whipple
that
was
wrong
because
even
a
state
game
commissioner
is
not
necessarily
infallible
or
always
on
the
right
side
of
every
question
as
a
rule
state
commissioners
and
state
wardens
are
keenly
alive
to
the
needs
of
their
states
in
new
game
protective
legislation
and
a
large
percentage
of
the
best
existing
laws
are
due
to
their
initiative
often
however
their
usefulness
is
limited
by
the
trammels
of
public
office
and
there
are
times
when
such
officers
can
not
be
too
aggressive
without
the
risk
of
arousing
hostile
influences
and
handicapping
their
own
departmental
work
for
this
reason
it
is
often
advisable
that
bills
which
propose
great
and
drastic
reforms
and
which
are
likely
to
become
should
originate
outside
the
commissioner
office
and
be
pushed
by
men
who
are
perfectly
free
to
abide
the
fortunes
of
open
warfare
it
should
be
distinctly
understood
however
that
lobbying
in

of
measures
is
important
part
of
the
legitimate

of

and
render
to

the

that

deserves

requires

a

for

runs

predict
that
it
will
result
in
a
great
recovery
of
the
native

of

commonwealth
that
will
be
after
we
have
stopped
all

who
made

of

clearly
honorable
mention
belongs
to

unsalaried

commissioner
of

acklen
than
whom
says
palmer
there
is
no
more
active
and
enthusiastic
game
protectionist
in
this
country
whatever
has
been
accomplished
in
that
state
is
due
to
his
activity
and
public
spirit
acklen
who
is
now
president
of
the
national
association
of
game
commissioners
is
a
prominent
lawyer
and
enjoys
the
distinction
of
being
the
only
commissioner
in
the
country
who
not
only
serves
without
pay
but
also
defrays
a
large
part
of
the
expenses
of
game
protection
out
of
his
own
pocket
surely
the
commonwealth
of
tennessee
will
not
long
permit
this
unsupported
condition
of
such
a
game
commissioner
to
endure
that
state
has
a
wild
fauna
worth
preserving
for
her
sons
and
grandsons
and
it
is
inconceivable
that
the
funds
vitally
necessary
to
this
public
service
can
not
be
found
i
cite
the
case
of
alabama
because
in
view
of
its
position
in
a
group
of
states
that
until
recently
have
cared
little
about
game
protection
it
may
be
regarded
as
an
unusual
case
commissioner
john
wallace
has
evolved
order
out
of
chaos
and
something
approaching
a
reign
of
law
out
of
the
absence
of
law
the
state
of
alabama
stands
as
an
example
of
what
can
be
accomplished
by
and
through
one
determined
man
who
is
right
and
knows
that
he
is
right
new
alabama
reminds
one
of
new
jersey
and
of
state
game
commissioner
ernest
napier
i
have
seen
him
on
the
and
i
know
that
his
strong
devotion
to
the
interests
of
the
wild
life
of
his
state
his
determination
to
protect
it
at
all
costs
and
his
resistless
confidence
in
asking
for
what
is
right
have
made
him
a
power
for
good
the
state
legislature
believes
in
him
and
enacts
the
laws
that
he
says
are
right
and
necessary
he
serves
without
salary
and
gives
to
the
state
time
labor
and
money
it
is
a
pleasure
to
work
with
such
a
man
in
commissioner
napier
won
a
pitched
battle
with
the
makers
of
automatic
and
pump
guns
both
shotguns
and
rifles
and
debarred
all
those
weapons
from
use
in
new
jersey
unless
satisfactorily
reduced
to
two
shots
the
state
of
massachusetts
is
fortunate
in
the
possession
of
a
very
fine
corps
of
ornithologists
nature
lovers
sportsmen
and
leading
citizens
who
on
all
questions
affecting
wild
life
occupy
high
ground
and
are
not
afraid
to
maintain
it
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
write
an
entire
chapter
on
this
subject
the
record
of
the
massachusetts
army
of
the
defense
is
both
an
example
and
an
inspiration
to
the
people
of
other
states
not
only
is
the
cause
of
protection
championed
by
the
state
game
commission
but
it
also
receives
constant
and
powerful
support
from
the
state
board
of
agriculture
which
maintains
on
its
staff
forbush
as
state
ornithologist
the
publications
of
the
board
are
of
great
economic
value
and
they
are
also
an
everlasting
credit
to
the
state
the
very
latest
is
a
truly
great
volume
of
pages
by
forbush
entitled
birds
and
shore
it
is
a
publication
most
damaging
to
the
cause
of
the
army
of
destruction
and
i
heartily
wish
a
million
copies
might
be
printed
and
placed
in
the
hands
of
lawmakers
and
protectors
the
fight
last
winter
and
spring
for
a
law
was
the
gettysburg
for
massachusetts
the
voice
of
the
people
was
heard
in
no
uncertain
tones
and
the
destroyers
were
routed
all
along
the
line
the
leaders
in
that
struggle
on
the
protection
side
were
forbush
william
wharton
george
field
edward
goding
lyman
hurd
ralph
holman
rev
wm
lord
and
salem
charles
with
such
leaders
and
such
supporters
any
cause
can
be
won
anywhere
the
case
of
pennsylvania
is
rather
peculiar
as
yet
there
is
no
large
and
resistless
organized
body
of
real
sportsmen
to
rally
to
the
support
of
the
state
game
commission
in
great
causes
as
is
the
case
in
new
york
as
a
result
with
a
paltry
fund
of
only
for
annual
maintenance
and
much
opposition
from
hunters
and
farmers
the
situation
is
far
from
satisfactory
fortunately
joseph
kalbfus
secretary
of
the
commission
and
chief
executive
officer
is
a
man
of
indomitable
courage
and
determination
but
for
this
state
of
mind
he
would
ere
this
have
given
up
the
fight
for
the
hunter
license
law
of
one
dollar
per
year
which
has
been
bitterly
opposed
by
a
very
aggressive
and
noisy
group
of
gunners
who
do
not
seem
to
know
that
they
are
grievously
misled
fortunately
commissioner
john
phillips
of
pittsburgh
is
the
ardent
supporter
of
kalbfus
and
a
vigorous
fighter
for
justice
to
wild
life
he
devotes
to
the
cause
a
great
amount
of
time
and
effort
and
in
addition
to
serving
without
salary
he
pays
all
his
campaign
expenses
out
of
his
own
pocket
his
only
recompense
for
all
this
is
the
sincere
admiration
of
his
friends
and
the
consciousness
of
having
done
his
full
duty
toward
the
wild
life
and
the
people
of
his
native
state
the
state
audubon
it
is
impossible
to
estimate
the
full
value
of
the
influence
and
work
of
the
state
audubon
societies
of
the
united
states
thus
far
these
societies
exist
in
states
from
the
beginning
their
efforts
have
tended
especially
toward
the
preservation
of
the
birds
and
it
is
well
that
the
song
and
other
insectivorous
birds
have
thus
been
specially
championed
unfortunately
however
if
that
policy
is
pursued
exclusively
it
leaves
very
important
species
of
game
birds
practically
at
the
mercy
of
the
army
of
destruction
it
would
seem
that
the
time
has
come
when
all
audubon
societies
should
take
up
as
a
part
of
their
work
active
in
helping
to
save
the
game
birds
from
extermination
the
national
organizations
of
new
york
city
on
january
the
united
states
of
america
contained
so
far
as
i
am
aware
not
one
organization
of
national
scope
which
was
devoting
any
large
amount
of
its
resources
and
activities
to
the
protection
of
wild
life
at
that
time
the
former
activities
of
the
committee
on
bird
protection
had
lapsed
the
city
of
new
york
contains
six
national
organizations
and
it
is
now
a
great
center
of
activities
in
behalf
of
preservation
furthermore
these
activities
are
steadily
growing
and
securing
practical
results
the
new

there
was
born
into
the
world
a
scientific
organization
having
for
its
second
declared
object
the
preservation
of
our
native
animals
it
was
the
first
scientific
society
or
corporation
ever
formed
so
far
as
i
am
aware
having
a
specifically
declared
object
of
that
kind
it
owes
its
existence
and
its
presence
in
the
field
of
conservation
to
the
initiative
and
persistence
of
madison
grant
and
henry
fairfield
osborn
for
sixteen
years
these
two
officers
have
worked
together
virtually
as
one
man
it
is
not
strange
to
find
a
sportsman
like
grant
promoting
the
cause
but
it
is
a
fact
well
worthy
of
note
that
of
all
the
zoologists
of
the
world
professor
osborn
is
the
only
one
of
real
renown
who
has
actively
and
vigorously
engaged
in
this
cause
and
taken
a
place
in
the
front
rank
of
the
defenders
grant
influence
on
the
protection
cause
has
been
strong
and
far
more
so
than
the
majority
of
his
own
friends
are
aware
he
has
promoted
important
protectionist
causes
from
alaska

is
keen
but
he
is
unable
to
speak
or
to

he
was

he
was

most
resourceful
and
fearless

to

the

and
a

times
more
than
they
ever
will
repay
either
to
him
or
to
his
cause
the
club
of
although
founded
in
this
organization
did
not
as
an
organization
actively
enter
the
field
of
protection
until
since
that
time
its
work
has
covered
a
wide
field
and
enlisted
the
activities
of
many
of
its
members
in
order
to
provide
a
permanent
fund
for
its
work
each
year
the

that
are
devoted

to
the
cause
the
committee
on

protective

and

is
a
strong
body
and
it
has
rendered
good
service
in
the
lines
of
activity
named
in
its
title
the
american
game
protective
and
propagation
this
is
the
youngest
protective
organization
of
national
scope
having
been
organized
in
its
activities
are
directed
by
john
burnham
for
five
years
chief
game
protector
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
a
man
thoroughly
conversant
with
the
business
of
protection
the
organization
is
financed
chiefly
by
means
of
a
large
annual
fund
contributed
by
several
of
the
largest
companies
engaged
in
manufacturing
firearms
and
ammunition
whose
directors
feel
that
the
time
has
come
when
it
is
both
wise
and
necessary
to
take
practical
measures
to
preserve
the
remnant
of
american
game
already
the
activities
of
this
organization
cover
a
wide
range
and
it
has
been
particularly
active
in
enlisting
support
for
the
weeks
bill
for
the
federal
protection
of
migratory
birds
the
wild

protective
association
came
into
existence
in
rather
suddenly
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
the
cause
of
the
bayne
bill
and
other
measures
it
raised
the
fund
that
met
the
chief
expenses
of
that
campaign
since
that
time
it
has
taken
an
important
part
in
three
other
hotly
contested
campaigns
in
other
states
two
of
which
were
successful
at
the
present
moment
and
throughout
the
future
these
new
york
organizations
need
sums
of
with
which
to
meet
the
legitimate
expenses
of
active
campaigns
for
great
measures
they
need
money
from
outside
the
state
of
new
york
much
of
the
burden
of
national
campaigning
has
been
and
is
being
left
to
be
borne
by
the
people
of
new
york
this
policy
is
growing
monotonous
there
is
every
reason
why
chicago
louis
cincinnati
pittsburgh
cleveland
philadelphia
baltimore
and
boston
should
each
year
turn
into
the
hands
of
these
and
well
managed
national
organizations
whose
officers
know
to
get
all
over
our
country
such
organizations
as
these
do
not
exist
in
other
cities
and
this
is
very
unfortunate
new
orleans
should
be
a
center
of
protectionist
activity
for
the
south
san
francisco
for
the

and
chicago
for

they
not

the
line
of
in
the
face
of
a
calamity
the
saving
of
life
and
property
and
the
check
of
fire
and
flood
depends
upon
good
judgment
and
quick
action
at
the
critical
moment
in
emergencies
the
slow
and
academic
method
will
not
serve
it
is
the
run
the
jump
the
short
cut
and
the
violent
method
that
saves
life
if
a
woman
is
drowning
the
sensible
man
does
not
wait
for
an
introduction
to
her
nor
does
he
run
to
an
acquaintance
to
borrow
his
boat
or
stop
to
put
on
a
collar
and
necktie
he
seizes
the
first
boat
that
he
can
find
and
breaks
its
lock
and
chain
if
necessary
or
failing
that
he
plunges
in
without
one
when
he
reaches
the
imperiled
party
he
does
say
will
you
kindly
let
me
save
you
he
seizes
her
by
the
hair
and
tries
to
keep
her
head
above
water
without
ceremony
that
is
the
condition
and
the
treatment
necessary
regarding
our
remnant
of
wild
life
we
are
compelled
to
act
quickly
directly
and
even
violently
at
times
if
we
save
anything
worth
while
there
is
to
depend
upon
the
academic
education
of
the
public
by
the
seductive
illustrated
lecture
on
birds
or
the
article
about
the
habits
of
mammals
those
methods
are
all
well
enough
in
their
places
but
we
must
not
depend
upon
them
in
emergencies
like
the
present
for
they
do
not
pass
laws
or
arrest
lawbreakers
give
the
public
all
of
that
material
that
you
can
supply
and
the
more
the
better
but
for
sake
depend
upon
the
spread
of
education
to
stop
the
work
of
the
if
you
do
all
the
wild
life
will
be
destroyed
while
the
educational
work
is
going
on
often
you
can
educate
a
gunner
and
make
him
a
protectionist
but
you
never
can
do
it
by
showing
him
pictures
of
birds
he
needs
strong
reasoning
and
exhortation
not
it
is
necessary
to
employ
the
most
direct
forceful
and
at
times
even
rude
methods
where
slaughtering
can
not
be
stopped
by
moral
suasion
it
must
be
stopped
with
a
hickory
club
the
thing
to
do
is
to
results
and
get
them
quickly
before
it
is
too
if
the
business
section
of
a
town
is
burning
down
no
one
goes
into
the
suburbs
to
lecture
on
architecture
or
exhibit
pictures
of
fire
apparatus
the
rush
is
for
water
men
and
dynamite
when
the
birds
all
around
you
are
being
shot
to
death
by
poachers
who
fear
not
god
nor
regard
man
and
you
need
help
to
stop
it
on
the
instant
run
to
your
neighbor
house
and
ring
his
bell
if
he
fails
to
hear
the
bell
pound
on
his
door
until
you
jar
the
whole
house
when
he
comes
down
blinking
and
rubbing
his
eyes
shout
at
him
come
out
your
birds
are
all
being
shot
to
pieces
are
they
he
will
say
but
what
can
do
about
it
i
ca
help
it
i
no
game
warden
put
on
your
clothes
get
your
and
come
out
and
drive
off
the
killing
gang
but
what
good
will
that
do
they
will
come
back
again
not
if
we
do
our
duty
we
must
have
them
arrested
and
appear
against
them
in
court
but
says
the
sleepy
citizen
that
wo
do
much
good
the
laws
are
not
strict
enough
and
besides
they
are
not
well
enforced
even
as
they
are
then
let
make
it
our
business
to
see
that
the
present
laws
are
enforced
and
go
to
our
members
of
the
legislature
and
have
them
pass
some
stronger
laws
and
this
brings
me
to
a
very
important
subject
how
to
pass
a
new
law
we
venture
to
say
that
the
average
citizen
little
realizes
how
possible
it
is
to
secure
the
passage
of
a
law
that
is
clearly
necessary
for
the
better
protection
of
wild
life
and
forests
because
of
this
and
of
the
necessity
for
exact
knowledge
i
shall
here
set
down
specific
instructions
on
this
subject
the
personal
one
determined
man
can
secure
the
passage
of
a
good
law
provided
he
is
reasonably
intelligent
and
sufficiently
determined
the
man
who
starts
a
movement
must
make
up
his
mind
to
follow
it
up
direct
its
fortunes
stay
with
it
when
the
storms
of
opposition
beat
upon
it
and
never
give
up
until
it
is
signed
by
the
governor
he
must
be
willing
to
sacrifice
his
personal
convenience
many
of
his
pleasures
and
work
when
his
friends
are
asleep
or
pleasuring
in
working
for
the
protection
of
wild
life
there
is
one
mighty
and
unfailing
source
of
consolation
it
is
this
cause
always
gains
in
strength
and
the
cause
of
the
destroyers
always
loses
strength
the
choice
of
a
be
do
not
rush
to
the
legislature
with
a
demand
for
a
law
to
permit
the
taking
of
with
in
the
creeks
of
your
township
or
to
give
your
county
a
specially
early
open
season
on
quail
in
order
that
your
boy
may
try
his
new
gun
before
he
goes
back
to
college
propose
any
local
for
in
progressive
states
local
game
legislation
is
coming
strongly
into
disfavor
just
as
it
should
legislate
for
your
whole
state
and
nothing
less
do
not
bother
your
legislature
with
a
trivial
bill
choose
a
cause
that
is
worth
while
to
grown
men
and
it
shall
be
well
with
you
it
takes
no
more
time
to
pass
a
large
bill
than
a
small
one
and
big
men
prefer
to
be
identified
with
big
measures
before
you
have
a
bill
drawn
advise
with
men
whose
opinions
are
worth
having
if
the
end
you
have
in
mind
is
a
great
and
good
one
whether
you
secure
support
in
advance
or
not
if
the
needs
of
the
hour
clearly
demand
the
measure
even
though
you
start
absolutely
alone
a
good
measure
never
goes
far
without
attracting
company
drafting
a
as
a
rule
the
members
of
a
legislative
body
do
not
have
time
to
draft
bills
on
subjects
that
are
new
or
strange
to
them
a
short
bill
is
easily
prepared
by
your
own
representative
but
a
lengthy
bill
covering
a
serious
reform
is
a
different
matter
hire
a
lawyer
to
draft
the
bill
for
you
a
really
good
lawyer
will
not
charge
much
for
drafting
a
bill
that
is
to
benefit
the
public
and
grind
no
private
axe
but
if
the
bill
is
long
and
requires
long
study
even
the
good
citizen
must
charge
something
your
bill
must
fully
recognize
existing
laws
it
must
be
either
prohibitory
or
permissive
which
means
that
it
can
say
what
shall
not
be
done
or
else
that
which
may
be
done
according
to
law
all
other
acts
being
forbidden
your
lawyer
must
decide
which
form
is
best
for
my
part
i
greatly
prefer
the
prohibitive
form
as
being
the
stronger
and
more
impressive
of
the
two
i
think
it
is
the
province
of
the
law
the
destruction
of
wild
life
and
forests
under
penalties
every
law
should
provide
a
penalty
for
its
infringement
but
the
penalty
should
not
be
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
offense
it
is
just
as
unwise
to
impose
a
fine
of
one
dollar
for
killing
for
food
as
it
is
to
provide
for
a
fine
of
three
hundred
dollars
a
fine
that
is
too
small
fails
to
impress
the
prisoner
and
it
begets
contempt
for
the
law
and
the
courts
a
fine
that
is
altogether
too
high
is
apt
to
be
set
aside
by
the
court
as
excessive
in
my
opinion
the
best
fines
for
wild
life
slaughter
would
be
as
follows
shooting
netting
or
trapping
and
other
birds
each
bird
to
killing
game
birds
out
of
season
each
bird
to
selling
game
contrary
to
law
each
offense
to
dynamiting
fish
to
seining
or
netting
game
fishes
to
shooting
birds
with
unfair
weapons
to
killing
an
egret
carolina
parakeet
or
whooping

the
introduction
of
a
much
wisdom
is
called
for
in
the
selection
of
legislative
champions
for
bills
it
is
possible
to
state
here
only
the
leading
principles
involved
of
course
it
is
best
to
look
for
an
introducer
within
the
political
party
that
is
in
the
majority
a
man
who
has
many
important
bills
on
his
hands
is
bound
to
give
his
best
attention
to
his
own
pet
measures
and
it
is
best
to
choose
a
man
who
is
not
already
overloaded
if
a
man
has
a
host
of
enemies
pass
him
by
by
all
means
choose
a
man
whose
high
character
and
good
name
will
be
a
tower
of
strength
to
your
cause
and
if
necessary
for
him
to
make
up

waited
three
long
and
anxious
weeks
in
the
hope
that
hon
george
blauvelt
would
finally
consent
to
champion
the
bayne
bill
in
the
new
york
assembly
at
last
blauvelt
consented
to
take
it
up
and
the
time
spent
in
waiting
for
his
decision
was
a
grand
investment
he
was
the
man
of
all
men
to
pilot
that
bill
through
the
assembly
very
often
the
quiet
man
of
a
legislative
body
is
a
good
man
to
champion
a
new
and
drastic
measure
the
quiet
man
who
makes
up
his
mind
to
take
hold
of
a
hard
bill
to
pass
often
astonishes
the
natives
by
his
ability
to
get
results
representative
john
lacey
of
iowa
made
his
name
a
household
word
all
over
the
united
states
by
the
quiet
steady
tireless
and
finally
resistless
energy
with
which
for
three
long
years
in
congress
he
worked
for
the
lacey
bird
bill
for
years
his
colleagues
laughed
at
him
and
cheerfully
voted
down
his
bill
but
he
persisted
his
cause
steadily
gained
in
strength
and
his
final
triumph
laid
the
axe
at
the
root
of
a
thousand
crimes
against
wild
life
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
this
land
he
rendered
the
people
of
america
a
service
that
entitles
him
to
our
everlasting
gratitude
and
remembrance
after
the
introduction
of
a
as
soon
as
a
bill
is
introduced
it
is
referred
to
a
committee
to
be
examined
and
reported
upon
if
there
is
opposition
and
to
every
bill
that
really
does
something
worth
while
there
always
is
opposition
then
there
is
a
hearing
the
committee
appoints
a
day
when
the
friends
and
foes
of
the
bill
assemble
and
express
their
views
the
week
preceding
a
hearing
is
your
busy
week
you
must
plan
your
campaign
down
to
the
smallest
details
pick
the
men
whom
you
wish
to
have
speak
for
ten
minutes
each
on
the
various
parts
of
your
bill
and
divide
the
topics
and
the
time
between
them
call
upon
the
friends
of
the
bill
in
various
portions
of
the
state
to
attend
and
say
something
go
up
with
a
strong
body
of
fine
men
as
many
organizations
represented
as
you
possibly
the
organizations
represent
the
great
mass
of
people
and
the
voters
also
when
you
reach
the
hearing
hand
to
your
bill
champion
who
will
be
floor
manager
for
your
side
a
clear
and
concise
list
of
your
speakers
carefully
arranged
and
stating
who
who
that
being
done
you
have
only
to
fill
your
own
ten
minutes
and
afterward
enjoy
the
occasion
the
value
of
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
in
working
for
a
bill
be
sure
of
your
never
let
your
opponents
catch
you
tripping
in
accuracy
of
statement
if
you
make
one
serious
error
your
enemies
will
turn
it
against
you
to
the
utmost
better
understate
facts
than
overstate
them
this
shrewd
old
world
quickly
recognizes
the
careful
conservative
man
whose
testimony
is
so
true
and
so
that
no
assaults
can
shake
it
legislators
are
quick
to
rely
on
the
words
and
opinions
of
the
man
who
can
safely
be
trusted
if
your
enemies
try
to
overwhelm
you
with
extravagant
statements
that
are
unfair
to
your
cause
the
chances
are
that
the
men
who
judge
between
you
will
recognize
them
by
their
and
discount
them
accordingly
work
with
sometimes
a
subject
that
is
put
before
a
legislative
body
is
so
new
and
the
thing
proposed
is
so
drastic
it
becomes
necessary
to
take
measures
to
place
a
great
many
facts
before
each
member
of
the
body
under
such
circumstances
the
member
naturally
desires
to
be
shown
the
cleanest
and
finest
campaigning
for
a
reform
measure
is
that
in
which
both
sides
deal
with
facts
rather
than
with
personal
importunities
with
a
good
cause
in
hand
it
is
a
pleasure
to
prepare
concise
statements
of
facts
and
conditions
from
which
a
legislator
may
draw
logical
conclusions
whenever
a
bill
can
be
won
through
in
that
way
game
protection
work
becomes
a
delight
in
all
important
new
measures
affecting
the
rights
and
the
property
of
the
whole
people
of
a
state
the
conscientious
legislator
wishes
to
know
how
the
people
feel
about
it
when
you
tell
him
that
the
wild
life
belongs
to
the
whole
people
of
the
state
and
this
bill
is
in
their
interest
he
needs
to
know
for
certain
that
your
proposition
is
true
sometimes
there
is
only
one
way
in
which
he
can
be
fully
convinced
and
that
is
by
the
people
of
his
district
then
it
becomes
necessary
to
send
out
a
general
alarm
and
call
upon
the
people
to
write
to
their
representatives
and
express
views
give
them
in
printed
matter
the
in
the
case
forecast
the
future
as
you
think
it
should
be
forecast
then
demand
that
the
men
and
women
who
are
interested
do
write
to
their
senators
and
assemblyman
and
express
views
in
own
way
let
there
be
no
machine
letters
sent
out
all
ready
for
signature
for
such
letters
are
a
waste
of
effort
and
belong
in
the
waste
baskets
to
which
they
are
quickly
consigned
the
members
of
legislative
bodies
hate
them
and
rightly
too
they
want
to
hear
from
men
who
can
think
for
themselves
give
reasons
of
their
own
and
express
their
desires
in
their
own
way
the
press
and
the
it
is
impossible
to
overestimate
the
influence
of
the
newspapers
and
the
periodical
press
in
general
in
the
protection
of
wild
life
but
for
their
sympathy
their
support
and
their
independent
assaults
upon
the
army
of
destruction
our
game
species
would
nearly
all
of
them
have
been
annihilated
long
ago
editors
are
sympathetic
and
responsive
as
keenly
sensitive
regarding
their
duties
as
any
of
the
rest
of
us
are
and
from
the
earliest
times
of
protection
they
have
been
on
the
firing
line
helping
to
beat
back
the
destroyers
it
is
indeed
a
rare
sight
to
see
an
editor
giving
aid
comfort
or
advice
to
the
enemy
i
can
not
recall
more
than
a
score
of
articles
that
i
have
seen
or
heard
of
during
thirty
years
in
this
field
that
opposed
the
cause
of

k
at
this

for

i
bear
in
particularly
grateful
remembrance
the
active

the

are
of

the

so
long
in

of

that
they

their

every

likes
exclusive

articles
on
that
basis
they
will
print
about
all
the

that
you
can
furnish

at

the

of

be
sent

broadcast

the
form

many
of
these

the

are

it

the

must
be
vouched
for

it

it

which
is
all
right
only
the

is
most
effective
when
printed
without
a

do
not
count
on

because
its
peculiar

render
it
almost
impossible

there

there
is
one
powerful
weapon
publicity
the
american
people
love
fair
play
and
there
is
nothing
so
fatal
to
an
unfair
fighter
as
a
searchlight
turned
full
on
him
without
fear
and
without
mercy
if
it
is
reliably
and
persistently
reported
that
some
citizen
who
ought
to
be
on
the
right
side
has
for
some
dark
reason
become
active
on
the
wrong
side
print
the
reports
in
a
large
newspaper
and
ask
him
publicly
if
they
are
true
if
the
reports
are
false
he
can
quickly
come
out
in
a
letter
and
say
so
and
end
the
matter
if
they
are
true
the
public
will
soon
know
it
and
act
accordingly
eternal
the
progress
of
a
bill
must
be
watched
by
some
competent
person
from
day
to
day
and
finally
from
hour
to
hour
i
know
one
bill
that
was
saved
from
defeat
only
because
its
promoter
dragged
it
almost
by
force
out
of
the
hands
of
a
tardy
clerk
and
accompanied
it
in
person
to
the
senate
where
it
was
passed
in
the
last
hour
of
a
session
a
bill
should
not
be
left
to
a
long
slumber
in
the
drawer
of
a
committee
such
delays
nearly
always
are
dangerous
signing
the
the
promoter
of
a
great
measure
always
seeks
the
sympathy
of
the
chief
executive
early
in
the
day
but
he
should
not
make
the
diplomatic
error
of
trying
to
exact
promises
or
pledges
in
advance
good
judges
do
not
give
away
their
decisions
in
advance
because
a
chief
executive
remarks
after
a
bill
has
been
sent
to
him
for
signing
that
he
can
not
approve
it
it
is
no
reason
to
give
up
in
despair
many
an
executive
approval
has
been
snatched
at
the
last
moment
as
a
brand
from
the
burning
for
a
hearing
before
the
bill
is
acted
at
the
hearing
and
before
it
and
after
the
people
who
wish
the
bill
to
become
a
law
must
express
themselves
by
letter
by
telegram
and
by
appeal
in
person
if
the
governor
becomes
convinced
that
an
of
his
people
desire
him
to
sign
the
bill
will
sign
even
though
personally
he
is
opposed
to
it
the
hall
mark
of
a
good
governor
is
a
spirit
of
obedience
to
the
will
of
the
great
majority
not
until
your
bill
has
been
signed
by
the
governor
are
you
ready
to
go
home
with
a
quiet
mind
take
off
your
armor
and
put
your
ear
to
the
telephone
while
you
hear
some
one
say
as
your
only
reward
well
done
good
and
faithful
servant
as
to
credit
do
not
count
upon
receiving
any
credit
for
what
you
do
in
the
cause
of
game
protection
outside
the
narrow
circle
of
your
own
family
and
your
nearest
friends
this
is
a
busy
world
and
the
human
mind
flits
like
a
restless
bird
from
one
subject
to
another
the
men
who
win
campaigns
are
forgotten
by
the
general
public
in
a
few
hours
there
is
nothing
more
fickle
or
more
fleeting
than
the
bubble
called
popular
applause
judging
by
the
experiences
of
great
men
i
should
say
that
it
has
no
substance
whatever
the
most
valuable
reward
of
the
man
who
fights
in
a
great
cause
and
helps
to
win
victories
is
the
profound
satisfaction
that
comes
to
every
good
citizen
who
bravely
does
his
whole
duty
and
leaves
the
world
better
than
he
found
it
without
the

new

needed
a
of
the
states
the
principles
of
protection
and
encouragement
are
now
so
firmly
established
as
to
leave
little
room
for
argument
regarding
their
value
when
they
are
set
forth
before
the
people
of
any
given
state
the
only
question
is
of
willingness
to
do
the
right
thing
of
duty
or
a
defiance
of
duty
of
good
citizenship
or
the
reign
of
selfishness
men
who
do
not
wish
to
do
their
duty
purposely
befog
great
issues
by
noisy
talk
and
tiresome
academic
discussions
of
trivial
details
and
such
men
are
the
curse
and
scourge
of
reform
movements
there
are
a
very
few
persons
who
foolishly
assert
that
there
are
too
many
game
laws
it
is
entirely
wrong
for
any
person
to
make
such
a
statement
for
it
tends
to
promote
harmful
error
the
fact
that
our
laws
are
or
are
not
fully
enforced
is
no
excuse
for
denouncing
their
purposes
we
have
all
along
been
too
timid
too
self
indulgent
and
too
much
afraid
of
hurting
the
feelings
of

to
make
the

of
any
state
or
province
and
i
will
guarantee
to
save
the
wild
life
of
that
region
i
will
not

make
adequate
laws
but
i
will
also
provide

penalties
by
which
will

it
is
easy
and
simple
for
men
who
are
not
afraid
i
have
been
at
considerable
pains
to
analyze
the
game
laws
of
each
state
ascertain
their
shortcomings
and
give
a
list
of
the
faults
that
need
correction
by
new
legislation
it
has
required
no
profound
wisdom
to
do
this
because
the
principles
involved
are
so
plain
that
any
intelligent
schoolboy
fifteen
years
old
can
master
them
in
one
hour
i
have
performed
this
task
hopefully
in
the
belief
that
in
many
states
the
real
issues
have
not
been
plainly
put
before
the
people
hereafter
no
state
shall
destroy
its
wild
life
through
ignorance
of
the
laws
that
would
preserve
it
let
no
man
say
that
it
is
too
late
to
save
the
wild
life
for
excepting
the
species
that
is
not
true
let
no
man
say
that
we
can
not
save
the
wild
life
by
law
for
that
is
not
true
either
as
long
as
laws
are
lax
even
people
will
take
advantage
of
them
there
are
millions
of
men
who
think
it
is
to
kill
all
the
game
that
the
law
there
are
thousands
of
women
who
think
it
is
right
to
wear
aigrettes
as
long
as
the
law
permits
their
sale
and
yet
if
we
are
resolute
and
diligent
there
is
plenty
of
hope
for
the
future
during
the
past
three
years
to
go
no
farther
back
we
have
seen
the
whole
state
of
new
york
swept
clean
of
the
traffic
in
native
wild
game
by
the
bayne
law
and
of
the
traffic
in
wild
birds
plumage
on
women
hats
through
the
dutcher
law
in
this
state
we
find
women
out
of
every
one
hundred
wearing
flowers
and
laces
and
plush
and
satin
on
their
hats
instead
of
the
heads
bodies
and
feathers
of
wild
birds
that
were
the
regular
thing
until
three
years
ago
the
change
has
been
a
powerful
commentary
on
the
value
of
good
laws
for
the
protection
of
wild
life
the
dutcher
law
has
caused
the
plumage
of
wild
birds
wholly
to
disappear
from
the
state
of
new
we
shall
here
point
out
the
plain
duty
of
each
state
and
then
it
will
be
up
to
them
individually
to
decide
whether
they
can
stand
the
or
not
a
state
or
a
nation
can
be
ungentlemanly
unfair
or
mean
just
the
same
as
an
individual
no
state
has
a
right
to
maintain
shambles
for
the
slaughter
of
migratory
game
or
song
birds
that
belong
in
part
to
sister
states
state
holds
its
migratory
bird
life
in
trust
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
of
the
nation
at
a
state
is
just
as
responsible
for
its
treatment
of
wild
life
as
any
individual
and
it
is
time
to
open
books
of
account
it
is
robbery
as
well
as
murder
for
any
southern
state
to
slaughter
the
robins
of
the
northern
states
where
no
robins
may
be
killed
southern
gentleman
can
permit
such
doings
after
the
crime
has
been
pointed
out
to
in
the
north
the
men
who
are
caught
shooting
robins
are
instantly
haled
to
court
and
fined
or
imprisoned
if
we
of
the
north
should
kill
for
food
the
mockingbirds
that
visit
us
the
people
of
the
south
instantly
would
brand
us
as
monsters
of
greed
and
meanness
and
they
would
be
perfectly
justified
in
so
doing
let
us
at
least
be
honest
in
agreeing
upon
a
state
of
fact
as
the
lawyers
say
whether
we
act
sensibly
and
mercifully
or
not
just
so
long
as
there
remains
in
this
land
of
ours
a
fauna
of
game
birds
and
the
gunners
of
the
states
are
allowed
to
dictate
the
laws
for
the
slaughter
of
it
just
so
long
will
our
present
protection
remain
utterly
absurd
and
criminally
inadequate
look
at
these
absurdities
new
york
new
jersey
and
many
other
northern
states
rigidly
prohibit
the
late
winter
and
spring
shooting
of
waterfowl
and
shore
birds
and
limit
the
bag
north
carolina
south
carolina
florida
and
other
southern
states
not
only
slaughter
wild
fowl
and
shore
birds
all
winter
and
spring
without
limit
but
several
of
them
kill
certain
birds
besides
all
the
northern
states
protect
the
robin
for
the
good
that
it
does
but
in
north
carolina
tennessee
mississippi
louisiana
and
some
other
southern
states
thousands
of
robins
are
shot
for
food
minnesota
has
stopped
spring
shooting
but
her
sister
state
on
the
south
iowa
obstinately
refuses
to
do
so
the
united
states
at
there
are
two
great
measures
that
should
be
carried
into
effect
by
the
governing
body
of
the
united
states
one
is
the
enactment
of
a
law
providing
federal
protection
for
all
migratory
birds
and
canada
and
mexico
should
be
induced
to
join
with
the
united
states
an
international
treaty
to
that
the
other
necessary
measure
is
the
passage
of
a
joint
resolution
of
congress
every
national
forest
and
forest
reserve
also
a
game
preserve
and
general
sanctuary
for
wild
in
which
there
shall
be
no
hunting
or
killing
of
wild
creatures
of
any
kind
save
predatory
animals
the
tendency
of
the
times
and
the
universal
slaughter
of
wild
life
on
this
continent
point
straight
as
an
arrow
flies
in
that
direction
soon
or
late
we
have
got
to
come
to
it
if
congress
does
not
take
the
initiatory
steps
people
such
a
consummation
is
necessary
it
is
justified
by
common
sense
and
the
inexorable
logic
of
the
situation
and
when
done
it
will
be
right
the
time
was
when
the
friends
of
wild
life
did
not
dare
speak
of
this
subject
in
washington
save
in
whispers
that
was
in
the
days
when
the
appalachian
park
bill
could
not
be
passed
and
when
there
were
angry
mutterings
and
even
curses
leveled
against
gifford
pinchot
and
the
forestry
bureau
because
so
many
national
forests
were
being
set
aside
that
was
in
the
days
when
a
few
western
thought
that
they
owned
the
whole
rocky
mountains
without
having
bought
them
the
american
people
have
grown
accustomed
to
the
idea
of
having
the
resources
of
the
public
domain
saved
and
conserved
for
the
benefit
of
the
millions
rather
than
lavished
upon
a
favored
few
it
is
perfectly
safe
to
talk
about
making
every
national
forest
a
first
class
sanctuary
and
it
is
up
to
the
people
to
request
congress
to
take
that
action
at
once
the
weeks
bill
the
anthony
bill
and
the
mclean
bill
now
before
congress
to
provide
federal
protection
for
migratory
birds
are
practically
identical
all
three
are
good
bills
and
it
matters
not
which
one
finally
becomes
a
law
whichever
is
put
forward
finally
for
passage
should
provide
federal
protection
for
migratory
birds
that
ever
enter
the
united
states
alaska
or
porto
rico
why
favor
the
duck
and
leave
the
robin
to
its
fate
or
vice
versa
it
will
be
just
as
easy
to
do
this
task
by
wholes
as
by
halves
the
time
to
hesitate
to
feel
timid
or
to
be
afraid
of
the
other
fellow
has
gone
by
the
millions
of
honest
and
americans
are
ready
to
back
the
most
thorough
and
most
drastic
policy
because
that
has
become
the
most
necessary
and
the
best
policy
furthermore
it
is
the
only
policy
worthy
of
serious
consideration
some
of
our
states
have
done
rather
well
in
protection
considering
the
absurdity
of
our
national
policy
as
a
whole
others
have
done
indifferently
and
some
have
been
and
still
are
very
remiss
here
is
where
we
intend
to
hew
to
the
line
and
without
fear
or
favor
set
forth
the
standing
of
each
state
according
to
its
merits
or
its
lack
of
merits
in
a
matter
such
as
now
confronts
us
regarding
the
wild
life
of
our
country
it
is
time
to
speak
plainly
in
the
following
call
of
the
states
the
glaring
deficiencies
in
state
game
laws
will
be
set
forth
in
detail
in
order
that
the
sore
spots
may
be
exposed
to
the
view
of
the
doctors
conditions
will
be
represented
they
exist
at
the
end
of
the
summer
of
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
these
faults
soon
may
be
corrected
a
of
the
states
alabama
it
is
a
satisfaction
to
be
able
to
open
this
list
with
the
name
of
a
state
that
is
entitled
to
a
medal
of
honor
for
game
protection
in
this
particular
field
of
progress
and
enlightenment
the
state
of
alabama
is
the
pioneer
state
of
the
south
new
york
now
occupies
a
similar
position
in
the
north
but
new
york
is
an
older
state
and
stronger
in
her
general
love
of
nature
the
attainment
of
advanced
protection
in
any
southern
state
is
a
very
different
matter
from
what
it
is
in
the
north
five
years
ago
alabama
set
her
house
in
order
the
slaughter
of
song
and
insectivorous
birds
has
been
so
far
stopped
as
any
southern
state
can
stop
it
unaided
by
the
federal
government
and
those
birds
are
recognized
and
treated
as
the
farmers
best
friends
the
absurd
system
of
attempted
protection
through
county
laws
has
been
abandoned
the
sale
of
game
has
been
stopped
and
since
that
stoppage
quail
have
increased
the
trapping
and
export
of
game
have
ceased
and
wild
turkeys
and
woodcock
are
now
increasing
it
is
unlawful
to
kill
or
capture
birds
bag
limits
have
been
imposed
but
bag
limit
laws
are
all
too
liberal
and
should
be
a
hunter
license
law
is
in
force
and
the
department
of
game
and
fish
is
night
hunting
is
prohibited
and
female
deer
may
not
be
killed
a
comprehensive
warden
system
has
been
provided
as
yet
however
alabama
permits
the
shooting
of
waterfowl
to
march
which
is
too
late
by
one
and
months
the
use
of
automatic
and
pump
guns
in
hunting
should
be
suppressed
there
should
be
a
limit
of
two
deer
per
year
and
killing
should
be
restricted
to
deer
with
horns
not
less
than
three
inches
long
the
story
of
game
protection
in
alabama
began
in
prior
to
that
time
the
slaughter
of
wild
life
was
very
great
it
is
known
that
enormous
numbers
of
quail
were
annually
killed
by
negro
farm
hands
who
hunted
at
least
three
days
each
week
regardless
of
work
to
be
done
the
slaughter
of
quail
wild
ducks
woodcock
doves
robins
and
snipe
was
described
as
nauseating
the
change
that
has
been
wrought
since
is
chiefly
due
to
the
efforts
of
one
man
alabama
owes
her
standing
to
the
admirable
qualities
of
john
wallace
her
game
and
fish
commissioner
author
of
the
state
policy
in
conservation
his
his
judgment
and
his
success
make
him
a
living
object
lesson
of
the
power
of
one
determined
man
in
the
conservation
of
wild
life
commissioner
wallace
is
an
ardent
supporter
of
the
weeks
and
anthony
bills
for
federal
protection
and
as
a
lawyer
of
the
south
he
believes
there
is
no
constitutional
inhibition
against
federal
legislation
for
the
protection
of
birds
of
passage
alaska
the
sale
of
game
must
be
absolutely
prohibited
forever
the
slaughter
of
big
game
by
indians
miners
and
prospectors
should
now
be
limited
and
strictly
regulated
by
law
on
rational
lines
the
slaughter
of
walrus
for
ivory
and
hides
both
in
the
alaskan
and
russian
waters
of
bering
sea
should
be
totally
prohibited
for
ten
years
the
service
should
be
quadrupled
in
number
of
wardens
and
in
general
effectiveness
the
service
should
be
supplied
with
two
vessels
independent
for
patrol
work
the
bag
limit
on
hoofed
game
is
per
cent
too
large
to
accomplish
these
ends
congress
should
annually
appropriate
for
the
protection
of
wild
life
in
alaska
the
present
amount
is
very
inadequate
and
the
great
interests
at
stake
amply
justify
the
larger
amount
it
is
now
time
for
alaska
to
make
substantial
advances
in
the
protection
of
her
wild
life
it
is
no
longer
right
nor
just
for
indians
miners
and
prospectors
to
be
permitted
by
law
to
kill
all
the
big
game
they
please
whenever
they
please
the
indolent
and
often
extortionate
indians
of
alaska
who
now
demand
big
money
for
every
service
they
perform
are
not
so
valuable
as
citizens
that
they
should
be
permitted
to
feed
riotously
upon
and
cow
moose
at
until
that
species
is
exterminated
miners
and
prospectors
are
valuable
citizens
but
that
is
no
reason
why
they
should
forever
be
allowed
to
live
upon
wild
game
any
more
than
that
hungry
prospectors
in
our
rocky
mountains
should
be
allowed
to
kill
cattle
alaska
and
its
resources
do
not
belong
to
the
very
few
people
from
the
states
who
have
gone
there
to
make
their
fortunes
and
get
out
again
as
quickly
as
possible
the
quicker
the
public
mind
north
of
wrangel
is
disabused
of
that
idea
the
better
its
game
belongs
to
the
people
of
this
nation
of
millions
and
it
is
a
safe
prediction
that
the
ninety
millions
will
not
continue
to
be
willing
that
the
miners
prospectors
and
indians
shall
continue
to
live
on
moose
meat
and
caribou
tongues
in
order
to
save
bacon
and
beef
frank
kleinschmidt
said
to
me
that
at
sand
point
alaska
he
saw
caribou
tongues
brought
in
by
an
indian
and
sold
at
fifty
cents
each
while
according
to
all
accounts
most
of
the
bodies
of
the
slaughtered
animals
became
a
loss
governor
clark
has
recommended
in
his
annual
report
for
that
the
protection
now
enjoyed
by
the
giant
brown
bear
ursus
on
kadiak
island
be
removed
for
the
benefit
of
settlers
their
it
goes
without
saying
that
no
one
proposes
that
predatory
wild
animals
shall
be
permitted
to
retard
the
development
of
any
wild
country
that
is
required
by
civilized
man
all
we
ask
in
this
matter
is
that
as
in
the
case
of
the
slaughter
of
on
the
pacific
coast
necessity
of
the
proposed
slaughter
shall
be
fully
and
adequately
proven
before
the
killing
it
is
fair
to
insist
that
the
episode
shall
not
be
repeated
on
kadiak
island
the
big
game
of
alaska
can
not
long
endure
against
a
limit
of
two
moose
three
mountain
sheep
three
caribou
and
six
deer
per
year
per
man
at
that
rate
the
moose
and
sheep
soon
will
disappear
the
limit
should
be
one
moose
two
sheep
two
caribou
and
four
deer
unless
we
are
willing
to
dedicate
the
alaskan
big
game
to
commercialism
no
sportsman
needs
a
larger
bag
than
the
revised
schedule
and
commercialists
should
not
be
allowed
to
kill
big
game
anywhere
at
any
time
let
us
bear
in
mind
the
fact
that
alaska
is
being
throughly
opened
up
to
the
man
with
a
gun
here
is
the
latest
evidence
from
the
new
circular
of
an
outfitter
i
will
have
plenty
of
good
horses
and
good
competent
and
courteous
guides
also
other
camp
attendants
if
desired
my
intention
is
to
establish
permanently
at
that
point
as
i
believe
it
is
the
gateway
to
the
finest
about
the
of
the
great
game
countries
of
north
america
the
road
is
open
the
is
ready
the
guides
are
waiting
go
on
and
slay
the
remnant
arizona
the
pigeons
and
all
birds
should
immediately
be
given
protection
and
a
salaried
warden
system
should
be
established
under
a
commissioner
whose
term
is
not
less
than
four
years
the
use
of
automatic
and
pump
guns
in
hunting
should
be
prohibited
spring
shooting
should
be
prohibited
arizona
has
good
reason
to
be
proud
of
her
position
in
the
ranks
of
the
best
states
no
other
state
or
territory
of
her
age
ever
has
made
so
good
a
showing
of
protective
laws
the
enactment
of
laws
to
cover
the
points
mentioned
above
would
leave
little
to
be
desired
in
arizona
that
state
has
a
bird
fauna
well
worth
protecting
and
game
wardens
are
extremely
necessary
arkansas
the
enforcement
of
game
laws
should
be
placed
in
charge
of
a
salaried
commissioner
spring
shooting
of
wildfowl
should
be
stopped
at
once
a
reasonable
close
season
should
be
provided
for
water
fowl
and
swans
should
be
protected
throughout
the
year
a
law
should
be
enacted
a
force
of
game
wardens
salaried
and
unsalaried
should
at
once
be
created
the
killing
of
female
deer
and
the
hounding
of
deer
should
be
stopped
no
buck
deer
should
be
shot
unless
horns
three
inches
long
are
seen
before
firing
a
hunter
license
law
is
necessary
and
the
fees
should
go
to
the
support
of
the
game
protection
department
the
local
exemptions
in
favor
of
market
hunters
in
mississippi
county
should
be
repealed
it
appears
that
in
arkansas
the
laws
for
the
protection
and
increase
of
wild
life
are
by
no
means
up
to
the
mark
at
this
moment
arkansas
is
next
to
florida
the
rearmost
of
all
our
states
in
protection
awake
arkansas
consider
the
peril
that
threatens
your
fauna
the
sunk
lands
in
your
northeastern
corner
along
the
francis
river
are
the
greatest
refuge
anywhere
in
the
mississippi
valley
between
the
gulf
coast
of
louisiana
and
the
of
minnesota
a
duty
to
the
nation
devolves
upon
you
to
protect
the
migratory
waterfowl
that
visit
your
great
bird
refuge
from
the
automatic
and
pump
guns
of
the
pothunters
who
shoot
for
northern
markets
and
kill
all
that
they
can
kill
those
sunken
confer
a
boon
on
all
the
people
of
the
mississippi
valley
by
making
that
region
a
bird
refuge
in
fact
as
well
as
in
name
heretofore
you
have
permitted
hired
market
gunners
from
outside
your
borders
to
slaughter
the
of
your
sunk
lands
literally
by
millions
and
ship
them
to
northern
markets
with
very
little
benefit
to
your
people
it
is
time
for
that
slaughter
to
cease
do
maintain
a
duck
and

california
has
on
her
books
a
series
that
look
rather
good
to
the
eye
but
which
are
capable
of
considerable
improvement
all
along
the
line
the
birds

quadrupeds
of
the
golden
state
are
vanishing
under
that
heading
a
vigorous
chapter
could
be
written
but
space
forbids
its
development
here
just
fancy
laws
that
permit
gunning
and
hunting
with
dogs
from
august
until
january
the
entire

think
of
the
nesting

after

california
wild
ducks
and
geese
have
been
slaughtered
to
an
extent
almost
beyond
belief
the
splendid
sage

and
the
grouse
are
greatly
reduced
in
numbers
of
her
hundreds
of
thousands
of

once
the
cheapest

in

scarcely
a

remains
her
mountain
sheep

almost
extinct
her
grizzly

are
gone
the
most
terrible
slaughter
ever
recorded
for
automatic
guns
occurred
in
glenn
county
on
when
two
men
whose
story
was
published
in
xvii
april
killed
geese
in
one
day
and
actually
bagged
of
them
in
every
person
who
has
paid
attention
to
game
protection
on
the
pacific
coast
well
knows
that
during
the
past
eight
years
or
more
the
work
of
game
protection
in
california
has
been
in
a
state
of
frequent
turmoil
at
times
the
lack
of
harmony
between
the
state
fish
and
game
commission
and
the
sportsmen
of
the
state
has
been
damaging
to
the
interests
of
wild
life
and
deplorable
in
the
case
of
warden
welch
in
santa
cruz
county
pernicious
politics
came
near
robbing
the
state
of
a
splendid
warden
but
the
courts
finally
overthrew
the
overthrowers
of
welch
and
reinstated
him
the
fish
and
game
commissioners
of
any
state
should
be
strictly
honest
and
sincere
so
long
as
they
possess
these
qualities
they
deserve
and
should
have
the
earnest
and
aggressive
support
of
all
sportsmen
and
all
lovers
of
wild
life
the
remnant
of
wild
life
is
entitled
to
a
square
deal
and
harmony
in
the
camp
of
its
friends
fortunately
california
has
an
excellent
force
of
salaried
game
wardens
in
all
and
volunteer
wardens
serving
without
salary
colorado
the
state
of
colorado
should
instantly
stop
the
sale
of
native
wild
game
to
be
used
as
food
it
should
stop
all
late
winter
and
spring
shooting
of
native
wild
birds
it
should
give
the
sage
grouse
pinnated
grouse
and
all
shore
birds
a
ten
year
close
season
remove
the
dove
from
the
list
of
game
birds
and
give
it
a
permanent
close
season
it
should
remove
the
crane
and
the
swan
from
the
list
of
game
birds
in
short
years
we
have
seen
in
colorado
a
waste
of
wild
life
and
the
destruction
of
a
living
inheritance
that
has
few
parallels
in
history
possibly
the
people
of
colorado
are
satisfied
with
the
residuum
but
some
outsiders
regard
all
rocky
mountain
shambles
with
a
feeling
of
horror
a
brief
ago
colorado
was
a
zoological
park
of
grand
scenery
and
big
game
the
scenery
remains
but
of
the
great
wild
herds
only
samples
are
left
and
of
some
species
not
even
that
the
last
bison
of
colorado
were
exterminated
in
lost
park
by
scoundrels
calling
themselves
taxidermists
in
of
the
mule
deer
that
inhabited
routt
county
and
other
portions
of
colorado
not
enough
now
remain
to
make
deer
hunting
interesting
a
perpetual
close
season
was
put
on
mountain
sheep
just
in
time
to
save
a
dozen
small
flocks
as
seed
stock
those
flocks
have
been
permitted
to
live
and
they
have
bred
until
now
there
are
perhaps
sheep
in
the
state
of
elk
only
a
remnant
is
left
now
protected
for
fifteen
years
the
grizzly
bear
is
so
thoroughly
gone
that
one
is
seen
only
by
a
rare
accident
but
black
bears
and
pumas
are
sufficiently
numerous
to
afford
fair
sport
provided
the
hunter
has
a
fine
outfit
of
dogs
horses
and
guides
of
antelope
several
bands
remain
but
it
is
reported
that
they
are
steadily
diminishing
the
herds
and
herders
of
domestic
sheep
are
blamed
for
the
decrease
and
i
have
no
doubt
they
deserve
it
the
sheep
and
their
champions
are
the
implacable
enemies
of
all
wild
game
and
before
them
the
game
vanishes
everywhere
the
lawmakers
of
colorado
have
tried
hard
to
provide
adequate
statutes
for
the
protection
of
the
wild
life
of
the
state
in
fact
i
think
that
no
state
has
put
forth
greater
or
more
elaborate
efforts
in
that
direction
for
example
in
under
the
leadership
of
judge
beaman
of
denver
colorado
initiated
the
more
game
movement
by
enacting
a
very
elaborate
law
providing
for
the
establishment
of
private
game
preserves
and
farms
for
the
breeding
of
game
under
state
license
and
the
tagging
and
sale
of
game
under
state
supervision
illustration
pigeon
often
mistaken
for
the
passenger
pigeon
the
rapid
slaughter
of
this
species
has
alarmed
the
ornithologists
of
california
who
now
fear
its
extinction
the
history
of
game
destruction
in
colorado
is
a
repetition
of
the
old
old
story
plenty
of
laws
but
a
hundred
times
too
many
hunters
killing
the
game
both
according
to
law
and
contrary
to
it
and
doing
it
five
times
as
fast
as
the
game
could
breed
that
combination
can
safely
be
warranted
to
wipe
out
the
wild
life
of
any
country
in
the
world
and
accomplish
it
right
swiftly
as
a
country
colorado
is
distinctly
out
of
the
running
her
people
are
too
lawless
and
her
frontiersmen
are
in
the
main
far
too
selfish
to
look
upon
plenteous
game
without
going
after
it
some
of
these
days
a
new
call
of
the
wild
will
arise
in
colorado
demanding
an
open
season
on
mountain
sheep
those
who
demand
it
will
say
what
harm
will
it
do
to
kill
a
few
surplus
bucks
it
will
improve
the
breed
and
make
the
herds
increase
faster
by
all
means
have
an
open
season
on
the
colorado
and
the
british
columbia
elk
it
will
do
them
good
the
excitement
of
ram
slaughter
will
be
good
for
the
females
will
it
not
of
course
they
will
breed
faster
after
that
with
all
the
big
rams
dead
any
surplus
wild
life
is
a
public
nuisance
and
should
promptly
be
shot
to
pieces
in
colorado
there
is
some
desire
that
estes
park
should
be
acquired
as
a
national
park
and
maintained
by
the
government
but
the
strong
reasons
for
this
have
not
yet
appeared
as
yet
we
have
not
heard
any
reason
why
the
state
of
colorado
should
not
herself
take
it
and
make
of
it
a
state
park
and
game
preserve
if
done
it
could
be
offered
as
a
partial
atonement
for
her
wastefulness
in
throwing
away
her
inheritance
of
grand
game
colorado
has
work
to
do
in
the
preservation
of
her
remnant
of
bird
life
in
several
respects
she
is
behind
the
times
the
present
is
no
time
to
hesitate
or
to
ask
the
gunners
what
wish
to
have
done
about
new
laws
for
the
saving
of
the
remnant
of
game
the
dictates
of
common
sense
are
plain
and
inexorable
let
the
lawmakers
do
their
whole
duty
by
the
remnant
of
wild
life
whether
the
game
killers
like
it
or
not
curse
of
domestic
sheep
upon
game
and
much
has
been
said
in
print
and
out
of
print
regarding
the
extent
to
which
domestic
sheep
have
destroyed
the
cattle
ranges
and
incidentally
many
game
ranges
of
the
west
but
the
half
hath
not
been
told
the
american
people
as
a
whole
do
not
realize
that
the
domestic
sheep
has
driven
the
domestic
steer
from
the
free
grass
of
the
wild
west
with
the
same
speed
and
thoroughness
with
which
the
of
the
and
swept
away
the
bison
i
have
seen
hundreds
of
thousands
of
acres
of
what
once
were
beautiful
and
fertile
lands
in
montana
that
has
been
left
by
grazing
sheep
herds
looking
precisely
as
if
the
ground
had
been
shaven
with
razors
and
then
sandpapered
the
sheep
have
driven
out
the
cattle
and
the
price
of
beef
has
gone
up
accordingly
neither
cattle
horses
nor
wild
game
can
find
food
on
ground
that
has
been
grazed
over
by
sheep
the
following
is
the
testimony
of
a
reliable
eye
witness
dillon
wallace
and
the
full
text
appears
in
his
book
and
camp
in
the
page
domestic
sheep
and
sheep
herders
are
the
greatest
enemies
of
the
antelope
as
well
as
of
other
game
animals
and
birds
in
the
regions
where
herders
take
their
flocks
the
ranges
over
which
domestic
sheep
pasture
are
denuded
of
forage
and
stripped
of
all
growth
and
antelope
will
not
remain
upon
a
range
where
sheep
have
been
thus
the
sheep
sweeping
clean
all
before
them
and
leaving
the
ranges
over
which
they
pass
unproductive
for
several
succeeding
seasons
of
pasturage
for
either
wild
or
domestic
animals
together
with
the
destructive
shepherds
are
the
worst
enemies
at
present
of
utah
wild
game
particularly
of
antelope
sage
hens
and
grouse
in
iron
county
which
has
already
become
an
extensive

settlers
tell
us
that
before
the
advent
of
sheep
grass
grew
so
luxuriously
that
a
yearling
calf
lying
in
it
could
not
be
seen
not
only
has
the
grass
here
been
eaten
but
the
roots
tramped
out
and
killed
by
the
hoofs
of
thousands
upon
thousands
of

and
now
wide
areas
where
not
long
since

new

states
continued
connecticut
the
sale
of
all
native
wild
game
regardless
of
its

should
be
prohibited
at
all
times
enact
at

a
close

on
the

quail
woodcock
snipe
and
all
shore
birds
even
in

those

guns
should
be
prohibited
in
hunting
the
enormous

limits
of

and
each

of
plover
snipe
and
shore
birds
is
a
crime
they
should
be
replaced
by
a
close
season
law
for
all
of
those
species
the
terms
of
the
game
commissioners
should
be
not

than
four
years
like
so
many
other
states
connecticut
has
recklessly
wasted
her
inheritance
during
the
fifteen
years
preceding
the
year
the
bird
life
of
that
state
had
decreased
per
cent
on

senator
geo
mclean
of
connecticut
stated
at
the
hearing
held
by
his
committee
on
forest
reservations
and
the
protection
of
game
this
fact
we
have
more
cover
than
there
was
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
more
brush
probably
but
there
is
not
one
partridge
ruffed
grouse
today
where
there
were
twenty
ten
years

first
of
all
connecticut
needs
a
close
season
law
to
save
her
remnant
of
shore
birds
before
it
is
completely
annihilated
then
she
needs
a
bayne
law
and
needs
it
badly
under
such
a
law
and
the
tagging
system
that
it
provides
the
state
game
wardens
would
have
so
strong
a
grip
on
the
situation
that
the
present
unlawful
sale
of
game
would
be
completely
stopped
measures
in
preventing
the
sale
of
game
will
not
answer
already
connecticut
has
wasted
thousands
of
dollars
in
fruitless
efforts
to
restock
her
desolated
woodlands
and
farms
with
quail
and
to
introduce
the
hungarian
partridge
but
even
yet
she
protect
her
own
native
species
men
of
connecticut
save
the
last
remnants
of
your
native
game
birds
before
they
are
all
utterly
exterminated
within
your
borders
do
ask
the
killers
of
game
what
will
agree
to
but
make
the
laws
what
they
should
be
if
you
want
a
gameless
state
let
the
destruction
go
on
as
it
now
is
going
with
licensed
in
the
field
each
year
and
you
will
surely
have
it
right
soon
delaware
stop
all
spring
shooting
at
once
stop
killing
shore
birds
for
ten
years
and
protect

indefinitely
enact
laws
in
very
small
figures
stop
the
sale
of
all
native
wild
game
regardless
of
its
use
by
enacting
a
bayne
law
enact
a
resident
license
law
and
provide
for
a
force
of
paid
game
wardens
stop
the
use
of
machine
in
killing
your
birds
the
state
of
delaware
is
nearly
twenty
years
behind
the
times
can
it
be
possible
that
her
governor
and
her
people
are
really
satisfied
with
that
position
we
think
not
i
dare
say
they
are
afflicted
with
apathy
and
the
latter
can
easily
back
up
general
apathy
to
an
extent
that
spells
no
game
laws
in
one
act
and
at
one
bold
stroke
delaware
can
step
out
of
her
position
at
the
rear
of
the
procession
of
states
and
take
a
place
in
the
front
rank
will
she
do
it
we
hope
so
for
her
present
status
is
unworthy
of
any
state
this
side
of
the
philippines
district
of
columbia
the
sale
of
all
native
wild
game
regardless
of
its
source
should
be
stopped
immediately
by
the
enactment
of
a
complete
bayne
law
if
within
the
district
is
continued
on
the
marshes
of
the
eastern
branch
and
on
the
potomac
river
common
decency
demands
the
enactment
of
laws
and
long
laws
of
the
most
modern
pattern
just
why
it
is
that
gross
abuses
against
wild
life
have
so
long
been
tolerated
in
the
territorial
center
of
the
american
nation
remains
to
be
ascertained
but
whatever
the
reason
the
situation
is
absurd
and
intolerable
and
congress
should
terminate
it
immediately
as
late
as
and
i
think
for
two
or
three
years
thereafter
thousands
of
were
sold
every
year
in
the
public
markets
of
washington
as
food
as

it

to

be
made

toe
the

it
whether

consent

not
florida
shooting

in

the

the

is
the

defiant
that
can
be
found
anywhere
in
the
united
states
the
have
practically
exterminated
the
egrets
wholly
annihilated
the
roseate
spoonbill
the
flamingo
and
also
the
carolina
parrakeet
on
july
one
of
them
killed
an
audubon
association
warden
guy
bradley
whose
business
it
was
to
enforce
the
state
laws
protecting
the
egret
rookeries
the
people
really
to
blame
for
the
shooting
of
guy
bradley
and
the
extermination
of
the
egrets
by
lawless
and
dangerous
men
are
the
vain
and
merciless
women
who
wear
the
white
badges
of
cruelty
as
long
as
they
can
be
purchased
they
have
much
to
answer
for
originally
florida
was
alive
with
bird
life
for
number
of
species
abundance
of
individuals
and
general
dispersal
throughout
the
whole
state
i
think
no
other
state
in
america
except
possibly
california
ever
possessed
a
bird
fauna
quite
comparable
with
it
once
its
bird
life
was
one
of
the
wonders
of
america
but
the
gunners
began
early
to
shoot
and
shoot
and
shoot
during
the
fifteen
years
preceding
the
general
bird
life
of
florida
decreased
in
volume
per
cent
in
it
was
at
a
very
low
point
and
it
has
steadily
continued
to
decrease
the
settlement
and
cultivation
of
the
state
has
of
course
had
much
to
do
with
the
disappearance
of
wild
life
generally
and
the
draining
and
exploitation
of
the
everglades
will
about
finish
the
birds
of
southern
florida
the
brown
pelicans
on
pelican
island
in
indian
river
has
been
taken
in
hand
by
the
national
government
as
a
bird
refuge
and
its
marvelous
spectacle
of
pelican
life
is
now
protected
nine
other
islands
on
the
coast
of
florida
have
been
taken
as
national
bird
refuges
and
will
render
posterity
good
service
the
great
private
game
and
bird
preserve
of
ray
pierce
at
apalachicola
known
as
vincent
island
containing
twenty
square
miles
of
wonderful
woods
and
waters
is
performing
an
important
function
for
the
state
and
the
nation
the
florida
bag
limit
on
quail
is
entirely
too
liberal
i
know
one
man
who
never
once
exceeded
the
limit
of
twenty
birds
per
day
but
in
the
season
of
he
killed
can
the
quail
of
any
state
long
endure
such
drains
as
that
from
a
zoological
point
of
view
florida
is
in
bad
shape
a
great
many
of
her
people
who
shoot
are
desperately
lawless
and
uncontrollable
and
the
state
is
not
financially
able
to
support
a
force
of
wardens
sufficiently
strong
to
enforce
the
laws
even
as
they
are
it
looks
as
if
the
slaughter
would
go
on
until
nothing
of
bird
life
remains
at
present
i
can
see
no
hope
whatever
for
saving
even
a
good
remnant
of
the
wild
life
of
the
state
the
present
status
of
protective
laws
in
florida
was
made
the
subject
of
an
article
in
and
of
august
by
john
wallace
game
commissioner
of
the
state
of
alabama
in
an
article
entitled
the
florida
situation
in
view
of
his
record
no
one
will
question
either
the
value
or
the
honest
sincerity
of
opinions
the
following
paragraphs
are
from
that
article
the
enactment
of
a
model
and
modern
game
law
for
the
state
of
florida
is
absolutely
imperative
in
order
to
save
many
of
the
most
valuable
species
of
birds
and
game
of
that
state
from
certain
depletion
and
threatened
extinction
the
question
of
the
protection
of
the
birds
and
game
in
florida
is
not
a
local
one
but
is
national
in
its
scope
birds
know
no
state
lines
and
while
practically
all
the
states
lying
to
the
north
of
florida
protect
migratory
birds
and
waterfowl
yet
these
are
recklessly
slaughtered
in
that
state
to
such
an
extent
as
to
be
appalling
to
all
sportsmen
and
bird
lovers
so
alarming
has
become
the
decrease
of
the
birds
and
game
of
florida
that
unless
a
halt
is
called
on
the
campaign
of
reckless
annihilation
that
has
been
ceaselessly
waged
in
that
state
the
sport
and
recreation
enjoyed
by
primeval
nimrods
will
linger
only
in
history
and
tradition
it
is
the
sincerest
hope
of
all
lovers
of
wild
life
of
the
american
continent
that
a
strong
and
invincible
sentiment
relative
to
the
imperative
necessity
of
real
conservation
legislation
be
crystallized
in
the
minds
of
the
members
elect
of
the
florida
legislature
to
the
end
that
the
next
legislature
will
spread
upon
the
statute
books
of
the
state
of
florida
a
model
and
modern
law
for
the
preservation
and
protection
of
the
birds
and
game
of
that
state
which
when
put
into
practical
operation
will
elicit
the
thanks
of
all
good
citizens
and
likewise
the
gratitude
of
future
generations
georgia
prohibit
late
winter
and
spring
shooting
and
provide
rational
seasons
for
wild
fowl
reduce
the
limit
on
deer
to
two
bucks
a
season
with
horns
not
less
than
three
inches
long
protect
the
meadow
lark
and
stop
forever
the
killing
of
doves
and
prohibit
the
use
of
automatic
and
pump
in
hunting
extend
the
term
of
the
game
commissioner
to
four
years
we
are
glad
to
report
that
georgia
has
already
begun
to
take
up
the
white
man
burden
the
protection
of
wild
life
is
now
a
proposition
and
in
it
every
real
man
with
red
blood
in
his
veins
has
a
duty
to
perform
the
state
of
georgia
has
recently
awakened
and
under
the
comprehensive
law
of
has
resolutely
undertaken
to
do
her
whole
duty
in
this
matter
idaho
the
imperative
duties
of
idaho
are
as
follows
stop
all
hunting
of
mountain
sheep
mountain
goat
and
elk
give
the
sage
grouse
and
close
seasons
at
once
to
forestall
their
extermination
stop
the
killing
of
doves
as
game
stop
the
killing
of
female
deer
and
of
bucks
with
horns
less
than
three
inches
long
enact
the
model
law
to
protect
birds
prohibit
the
use
of
machine
in
hunting
extend
the
state
warden
term
to
four
years
like
montana
wyoming
and
colorado
the
state
of
idaho
has
wasted
her
stock
of
game
and
it
is
to
be
feared
that
several
species
are
now
about
to
disappear
from
that
state
i
am
told
that
the
sage
grouse
is
almost
gone
and
i
think
that
the
antelope
caribou
and
mountain
sheep
are
in
the
same
condition
of
scarcity
if
the
people
of
idaho
wish
to
save
their
wild
fauna
they
must
be
up
and
doing
the
time
to
temporize
theorize
be
conservative
and
has
gone
by
it
is
that
fatal
policy
that
causes
men
to
slumber
until
it
is
too
late
to
act
and
we
will
watch
with
keen
interest
to
see
whether
the
real
men
of
idaho
are
big
enough
to
do
their
whole
duty
in
time
to
benefit
their
state
in
palmer
credited
idaho
with
the
possession
of
about
five
hundred
moose
and
two
hundred
antelope
there
is
one
feature
of
the
idaho
game
law
that
may
well
stand
unchanged
the
open
season
on
ibex
of
which
one
per
year
may
be
killed
may
as
well
be
continued
one
myth
per
year
is
not
an
extravagant
bag
for
any
intelligent
hunter
and
it
seems
that
the
ibex
will
not
down
being
officially
recognized
by
idaho
its
place
in
our
fauna
now
seems
assured
illinois
enact
a
bayne
law
and
stop
the
sale
of
all
native
wild
game
regardless
of
source
and
regardless
of
the
gay
revelers
of
chicago
in
illinois
the
bag
limits
on
birds
are
nearly
all
at
least
per
cent
too
high
they
should
be
as
follows
no
squirrels
doves
or
shore
birds
six
quail
five
woodcock
ten
coots
ten
rail
ten
ducks
three
geese
and
three
brant
with
a
total
limit
of
ten
waterfowl
per
day
doves
should
be
removed
from
the
game
list
all
tree
squirrels
and
chipmunks
should
be
perpetually
protected
as
companions
to
man
unfit
for
food
the
sale
of
aigrettes
should
be
stopped
and
chicago
placed
in
the
same
class
as
boston
new
york
new
orleans
and
san
francisco
the
use
of
all
machine
shotguns
in
hunting
should
be
prohibited
the
chief
for
the
grinding
up
of
american
game
are
chicago
philadelphia
baltimore
new
orleans
and
san
francisco
louis
cleared
her
record
in
new
york
thoroughly
cleaned
her
augean
stable
in
and
massachusetts
won
her
bayne
law
by
a
desperate
battle
in
in
pennsylvania
probably
will
enact
a
bayne
law
fancy
a
city
in
the
center
of
the
united
states
sending
to
norway
for
ptarmigan
to
eat
as
chicago
did
in
and
that
was
only
one
order
for
forty
years
the
marshes
prairies
farms
and
streams
of
the
whole
upper
mississippi
valley
have
been
combed
year
after
year
by
the
guns
of
the
market
shooters
often
the
migratory
game
was
located
by
telegraphic
reports
game
birds
were
slain
by
the
barrel
and
for
the
chicago
market
and
the
fool
farmers
of
the
middle
west
stolidly
plowed
their
fields
and
fed
their
hogs
and
permitted
the
slaughter
to
go
on
the
sons
of
those
farmers
go
to
the
museums
and
zoological
parks
of
the
cities
to
see
specimens
of
pinnated
grouse
crane
woodcock
ducks
and
other
species
that
the
market
shooters
have
wiped
out
and
their
fathers
wax
eloquent
in
telling
of
the
flocks
of
pigeons
that
darkened
the
sky
and
the
big
droves
of
prairie
chickens
that
used
to
rise
out
of
the
with
a
roar
like
a
coming
storm
chicago
stands
reformed
her
markets
are
open
to
only
the
game
killable
in
illinois
but
they
are
wide
open
to
all
killed
game
imported
from
other
states
from
to
feb
through
that
hole
in
her
game
laws
any
can
drive
a
of
course
any
game
offered
in
chicago
has
been
legally
killed
in
some
other
state
who
can
prove
otherwise
in
addition
to
the
imported
game
illegally
killed
in
other
states
the
starving
population
of
chicago
may
also
buy
for
cash
and
consume
with
their
champagne
in
november
and
december
all
the
illinois
doves
that
can
be
combed
out
by
the
after
the
awful
iroquois
theatre
fire
in
chicago
in
the
game
dealers
reported
a
heavy
falling
off
in
the
consumption
of
game
the
tragedy
caused
the
temporary
closing
of
the
theaters
and
the
falling
off
in
suppers
may
be
said
to
have
taken
away
the
appetites
of
thousands
of
erstwhile
consumers
of
game
incidentally
it
showed
who
consumes
purchased
game
the
people
of
illinois
should
now
enact
a
bayne
law
without
changing
a
single
word
and
bring
chicago
up
to
the
level
of
new
york
louis
and
boston
the
present
bag
limits
on
illinois
game
birds
are
fatally
high
as
they
stand
with
licensed
gunners
in
the
field
each
year
what
else
do
they
mean
than
extermination
the
men
of
illinois
have
just
two
alternatives
between
which
to
choose
drastic
and
immediate
preservation
or
a
gameless
state
which
shall
it
be
indiana
indiana
should
hasten
to
stop
spring
shooting
she
should
enact
a
law
prohibiting
the
sale
for
millinery
purposes
of
the
plumage
of
all
wild
birds
save
ducks
killed
in
their
open
season
a
bayne
law
absolutely
prohibiting
the
sale
of
all
native
wild
game
should
be
enacted
at
once
the
killing
of
squirrels
should
be
prohibited
because
they
are
not
white
men
game
ruffed
grouse
and
quail
should
have
five
year
close
seasons
the
use
of
pump
and
autoloading
guns
in
hunting
should
be
prohibited
in
indiana
the
deer
is
extinct
this
means
very
close
hunting
and
a
bad
outlook
for
all
other
game
larger
than
the
sparrow
on
october
eleven
heads
of
greater
bird
of
paradise
with
plumes
attached
were
offered
for
sale
within
one
hundred
feet
of
the
headquarters
of
the
fourth
national
conservation
congress
the
prices
ranged
from
to
and
while
we
looked
two
ladies
came
up
one
of
whom
pointed
to
a
corpse
and
said
there
i
want
one
o
them
an
i
to
it
too
iowa
spring
shooting
should
be
stopped
at
once
and
forever
the
killing
of
all
tree
squirrels
and
chipmunks
should
cease
all
shore
birds
that
visit
iowa
deserve
a
close
season
especially
is
the
shooting
of
plover
sandpiper
marsh
and
beach
birds
rail
duck
geese
and
brant
from
september
to
april
an
outrage
iowa
should
prohibit
the
use
of
the
machine
guns
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
she
will
awaken
sufficiently
to
do
so
it
is
said
that
the
indian
word
iowa
means
the
drowsy
or
sleepy
ones
politically
and
educationally
iowa
is
all
right
but
in
the
protection
of
wild
life
she
is
ten
years
behind
the
times
in
almost
everything
save
the
prohibition
of
the
sale
of
game
knows
better
than
to
pursue
the
course
that
she
she
boasts
about
her
corn
and
hogs
but
she
is
deaf
to
the
appeals
of
the
states
surrounding
her
on
the
subject
of
spring
shooting
for
years
minnesota
has
set
her
a
good
example
but
nothing
moves
her
to
step
up
where
she
belongs
in
the
phalanx
of
intelligent
states
the
foregoing
may
sound
harsh
but
in
view
of
what
other
states
have
endured
from
iowa
stubbornness
regarding
migratory
game
the
time
for
silent
treatment
of
her
case
has
gone
by
she
is
in
the
same
class
as
north
carolina
south
carolina
and
maryland
at
the
tail
end
of
the
procession
of
states
she
cares
everything
for
corn
and
hogs
but
little
for
wild
life
kansas
spring
shooting
should
be
stopped
at
once
with
apologies
for
not
having
done
so
long
ago
the
continued
shooting
of
prairie
chickens
when
the
species
is
near
extermination
is
outrageous
and
should
be
prohibited
for
ten
years
doves
should
be
removed
permanently
from
the
game
list
partly
as
a
measure
of
self
respect
kansas
should
treat
herself
to
a
force
of
salaried
game
wardens
rendering
real
service
she
should
bar
out
the
machine
guns
as
unfit
for
use
in
a
state
kansas
has
calmly
witnessed
the
extermination
of
her
bison
elk
deer
antelope
wild
turkeys
sage
grouse
whooping
cranes
and
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
her
pinnated
grouse
without
a
pang
what
is
wild
game
in
comparison
with
fat
hogs
and
draw
a
line
around
the
area
of
the
united
states
and
within
it
you
will
find
more
spring
shooting
more
sale
of
game
and
more
extermination
of
species
than
in
any
other
area
in
the
united
states
i
refer
to
nebraska
kansas
iowa
missouri
illinois
indiana
ohio
kentucky
and
tennessee
in
not
one
of
these
states
except
missouri
is
there
any
big
game
hunting
and
in
the
majority
of
them
spring
shooting
is
lawful
in
the
island
of
mauritius
it
was
swine
that
exterminated
the
dodo
in
the
united
states
hogs
and
game
extermination
still
go
hand
in
hand
since
the
days
of
the
dodo
however
a
new
species
of
swine
has
been
developed
it
is
now
widely
known
as
the
and
it
has
been
officially
recognized
by
both
bench
and
bar
kentucky
nearly
everything
that
a
state
should
maintain
in
the
line
of
wild
life
protection
it
is
easier
to
tell
what
she
has
than
to
recite
what
she
should
have
kentucky
spring
she
has
bag
and
she
has
open
on
everything
save
introduced
pheasants
she
protects
from
sale
only
quail
grouse
and
wild
turkey
within
her
own
this
means
that
her
markets
are
practically
wide
open
until
recently
the
people
of
kentucky
have
been
very
indifferent
to
the
value
of
her
but
with
the
new
law
enacted
this
year
providing
for
a
game
commission
and
a
game
protection
fund
surely
every
member
of
the
army
of
the
defense
will
wish
to
her
efforts
in
game
conservation
and
stand
ready
to
lend
a
helping
hand
whenever
help
can
be
utilized
kentucky
should
at
one
grand
coup
spring
shooting
and
all
sale
of
wild
game
accord
long
close
seasons
to
all
species
that
are
verging
on
extinction
protect
doves
establish
moderate
bag
limits
and
stop
the
use
of

if
she
takes
up
these
measures
at
the
rate
of
only
one
at
each
legislative
session
by
the
time
her
laws
are
perfect
her
game
will
be
louisiana
on
more
counts
than
one
louisiana
is
in
the
list
of
great
delinquents
for
behold
the
things
that
she
needs
to
do
protect
deer
for
five
years
instantly
take
the
robin
dove
grosbeak
and

is
very
culpable
for
good
reasons
forty
states
of

strictly
prohibit
the

of

insectivorous
birds
the
duty
of
every

to
protect
those

is
not
a
debatable
proposition
i
put
this
question
to
the
people
of
louisiana
mississippi
north
carolina
tennessee
and
other
states
where
the
robin
is
treated
as
a

is
it
fair
of
you
to
kill

new

in

states
continued
maine
there
are
reasons
for
the
belief
that
maine
is
conserving
her
large
game
better
than
any
other
state
or
province
in
north
america
one
glance
over
her
laws
is
sufficient
to
convince
anyone
that
instead
of
studying
the
clamor
of
her
shooting
population
maine
has
actually
been
studying
the
needs
of
her
game
and
providing
for
those
needs
if
all
other
states
were
doing
equally
well
the
task
of
writing
a
book
of
admonition
would
have
been
unnecessary
the
proof
of
maine
alertness
is
to
be
found
in
the
number
of
her
extra
short
or
entirely
closed
seasons
on

for
example
cow
and
calf
moose
are
permanently
protected
only
bull
moose

at

a
close

on
gray

black
squirrels
doves

is
no

the
open

for

varies
from
ten
weeks
to
four

in
parts
of
three
counties
there
is
no
open
season
at
all
silencers
are
prohibited
and

may
be

nearly
all

in
two
places
on

people
who
have
not
learned
the
facts
habitually
think
of
maine
as
a
vast
for
deer
and
it
is
well
for
it
to
be
known
that
the
have
been
carefully
designated
according
to
the
abundance
or
scarcity
of
game
maine
has
wisely
chosen
to
regard
her
and
her
deer
as
a
valuable
asset
and
she
manages
them
accordingly
to
be
a
guide
in
that
state
is
to
be
a
good
citizen
and
a
protector
of
game
from
illegal
slaughter
no
may
hunt
without
a
licensed
guide
the
licenses
for
the
thousands
of
deer
killed
in
maine
each
year
and
the
expenses
of
the
visiting
sportsmen
who
hunt
them
annually
bring
into
the
state
and
leave
there
a
huge
sum
of
money
variously
estimated
at
from
to
one
can
only
guess
at
the
amount
from
the
number
of
licenses
issued
but
certainly
the
total
can
not
be
less
than
although
carleton
is
no
longer
chairman
of
the
commission
of
inland
fisheries
and
game
the
splendid
services
that
he
rendered
the
state
of
maine
during
his
thirteen
years
of
service
especially
in
the
creation
of
a
good
code
of
game
laws
constitute
an
imperishable
monument
to
his
name
and
fame
there
is
very
little
that
maine
needs
in
the
line
of
new
legislation
or
better
protection
to
her
game
with
the
enactment
of
a
resident
license
law
and
a
close
season
for
woodcock
plover
snipe
and
sandpipers
i
think
her
laws
for
the
protection
of
wild
life
would
be
sufficiently
perfect
for
all
practical
purposes
the
state
is
to
be
congratulated
upon
its
wise
and
efficient
handling
of
the
situation
maryland
how
has
it
come
to
pass
that
maryland
more
good
laws
than
any
other
state
in
the
union
except
north
carolina
of
the
really
fundamental
protective
laws
embracing
the
list
that
to
every
state
seems
indispensable
maryland
has
almost
none
save
certain
laws
otherwise
the
state
is
wide
open
it
is
indeed
high
time
that
she
should
abandon
her
present
attitude
of
hostility
to
wild
life
and
become
a
good
neighbor
she
should
do
what
is
and
about
the
protection
of
the
migratory
game
and
bird
life
that
annually
passes
twice
through
her
territory
at
the
last
session
of
the
maryland
legislature
the
law
preventing
the
use
of
power
boats
in
shooting
was
repealed
that
was
a
step
ten
years
backward
and
maryland
should
be
ashamed
of
it
the
list
of
things
that
maryland
must
do
in
order
to
clear
her
record
is
a
long
one
here
it
is
local
regulations
should
be
replaced
by
a
uniform
state
law
the
sale
of
all
native
wild
game
should
be
stopped
spring
and
late
winter
shooting
of
game
should
be
stopped
all
birds
not
already
included
under
the
statutes
should
be
protected
the
exportation
of
all
game
should
be
prohibited
unless
accompanied
by
the
man
who
shot
it
bearing
his
license
and
the
law
should
be
instead
of
depending
upon
a
separate
enactment
for
each
county
there
should
be
a
hunter
license
law
for
all
who
hunt
the
use
of
machine
shotguns
in
hunting
should
be
stopped
at
once

massachusetts
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
moved
up
into
the
foremost
rank
of
states
where
for
one
year
new
york
had
stood
alone
she
passed
a
counterpart
of
the
new
york
law
absolutely
prohibiting
the
sale
of
all
wild
american
game
in
massachusetts
but
providing
for
the
sale
of
game
that
has
been
reared
in
preserves
and
tagged
by
state
officers
this
victory
was
achieved
only
after
three
months
of
hard
fighting
the
coalition
of
sportsmen
zoologists
and
friends
of
wild
life
in
general
proved
irresistible
just
as
a
similar
union
of
forces
accomplished
the
bayne
law
in
new
york
in
the
victory
is
highly
instructive
as
great
victories
usually
are
it
proves
once
more
that
whenever
the
american
people
can
be
aroused
from
their
normal
apathy
regarding
wild
life
good
conservation
legislation
can
be
enacted
the
prime
necessities
to
success
are
good
measures
good
management
a
reasonable
campaign
fund
and
tireless
energy
and
persistence
massachusetts
is
to
be
roundly
congratulated
on
having
so
thoroughly
cleaned
up
her
situation
incidentally
five
bills
for
the
repeal
of
the
massachusetts
law
against
spring
shooting
were
introduced
and
each
one
went
down
to
the
defeat
that
it
deserved
repeal
of
a
law
anywhere
is
a
step
backward
ten
years
massachusetts
needs
a
law
more
in
keeping
with
her
small
remnant
of
wild
life
and
that
she
will
have
ere
long
very
soon
also
her
sportsmen
will
raise
the
standard
of
ethics
in
shotgun
shooting
by
barring
out
the
automatic
and
pump
shotguns
so
much
beloved
by
the
market
shooters
as
matters
stand
at
this
date
the
old

the
following
new
laws
low

on

the

laws
of
michigan
are
in
excellent
shape
and
leave
little
to
be
desired
in
the
line
of
betterment
except
to
be
simplified
all
the
game
protected
by
the
laws
of
the

is
debarred
from

squirrels
pinnated
grouse
doves
and
wild

enjoy
long
close

the

limits
on
deer
and
game
birds
are
reasonably
low
spring
shooting
still
is
possible
on
nine
species
of
ducks
and
this
should
be
stopped
without
delay
only
three
or
four
suggestions
are
in
order
all
spring
shooting
should
be
prohibited
all
shore
birds
should
have
a
close
season
the
use
of
the
machine
shotguns
in

should
be
stopped
the
laws
should
permit
the
sale
under

of
all
species
of

that
can
successfully
be
reared
in
preserves
on
a
commercial
basis
two
or
three
state
game
preserves
for

each
at

four
miles
square
should
be
established
without
delay
minnesota
this
state
should
at
once
enact
a
law
that
will
do
some
good
instead
of
the
statutory
farce
now
on
the
books
make
it
fifteen
birds
per
day
of
waterfowl
all
species
combined
and
no
grouse
or
quail
there
should
be
close
seasons
enacted
for
quail
grouse
plover
woodcock
snipe
and
all
other
shore
birds
a
law
should
be
enacted
prohibiting
the
use
of
firearms
by
unnaturalized
aliens
and
a
license
for
all
naturalized
aliens
provision
should
be
made
for
a
large
state
game
refuge
in
southern
minnesota
the
state
should
prohibit
the
use
of
machine
guns
in
hunting
direct
and
reliable
advices
show
that
the
game
situation
in
minnesota
is
far
from
encouraging
several
species
are
threatened
with
extinction
at
an
early
date
in
northern
minnesota
it
is
reported
that
much
game
is
surreptitiously
trapped
and
slaughtered
the
bob
white
is
reported
as
threatened
with
total
extinction
at
an
early
date
but
i
think
the
prairie
chicken
will
be
the
first
bird
species
to
go
moose
will
soon
be
extinct
everywhere
in
minnesota
except
in
the
game
preserves
apparently
there
is
now
about
one
duck
in
minnesota
for
every
ten
ducks
that
were
there
only
ten
years
ago
now
what
is
minnesota
going
to
do
about
all
this
is
she
willing
through
apathy
to
become
a
gameless
state
her
people
need
to
arouse
themselves
and
pass
several
laws
her
bag
limit
of
birds
of
quail
grouse
woodcock
and
plover
and
per
day
of
the
waterbirds
is
a
joke
and
nothing
more
but
it
is
no
laughing
matter
it
spells
extermination
mississippi
the
legalized
slaughter
of
robins
cedar
birds
grosbeaks
and
doves
should
cease
immediately
on
the
basis
of
economy
of
resources
and
a
square
deal
to
all
the
states
lying
northward
of
mississippi
the
shooting
of
all
should
cease
on
january
a
reasonable
limit
should
be
established
on
deer
a
hunting
license
law
should
be
passed
at
once
fixing
the
fee
at
and
devoting
the
revenue
to
the
pay
of
a
corps
of
game
wardens
selected
on
a
basis
of
ability
and
fitness
the
administration
of
the
game
laws
should
be
placed
in
charge
of
a
salaried
game
commissioner
it
is
seriously
to
the
discredit
of
mississippi
that
her
laws
actually
classify
robins
grosbeaks
and
doves
as
game
and
them
killable
as
such
from
to
march
i
should
think
that
if
no
economic
consideration
carried
weight
in
mississippi
state
pride
alone
would
be
sufficient
to
promote
a
correction
of
the
evil
if
we
of
the
north
were
to
slaughter
mockingbirds
for
food
when
they
come
north
to
visit
us
the
men
of
the
south
would
call
us
greedy
barbarians
and
they
would
be
quite
right
missouri
the
missouri
bag
limits
that
permit
the
killing
or
possession
of
fifty
birds
per
day
are
absurd
and
fatally
liberal
the
utmost
should
be
and
even
that
is
too
high
doves
should
be
taken
off
the
list
of
game
birds
and
protected
throughout
the
year
and
so
should
all
tree
squirrels
spring
shooting
of
shore
birds
and
waterfowl
should
be
prohibited
without
delay
a
law
against
automatic
and
pump
guns
should
be
enacted
at
the
next
legislative
session
as
a
public
lesson
on
the
raising
of
the
standard
of
ethics
in
shooting
the
state
of
missouri
is
really
strong
in
her
position
as
a
state
she
perpetually
protects
such
vanishing
species
as
the
ruffed
grouse
prairie
chicken
pinnated
grouse
woodcock
and
all
her
shore
birds
save
snipe
and
plover
she
prohibits
the
sale
of
native
game
and
the
killing
of
female
deer
but
she
wisely
permits
the
sale
of
elk
and
deer
under
the
tags
of
the
state
game
commission
for
nearly
all
the
wild
game
that
is
accessible
her
markets
are
tightly
closed
we
heartily
congratulate
missouri
on
her
advanced
position
on
the
sale
of
game
and
we
hope
that
the
people
of
iowa
will
even
yet
profit
by
her
good
example
montana
like
colorado
and
wyoming
montana
is
wasting
a
valuable
heritage
of
wild
game
while
she
struggles
to
maintain
the
theory
that
she
still
is
in
the
list
of
states
that
furnish
hunting
it
is
a
fact
that
ten
years
ago
most
sportsmen
began
to
regard
montana
as
a
for
big
game
and
began
to
seek
better
elsewhere
british
columbia
alberta
and
alaska
have
done
much
for
the
game
of
montana
by
drawing
sportsmen
away
from
it
henry
avare
the
state
game
warden
is
optimistic
regarding
even
the
big
game
and
believes
that
it
is
holding
its
own
this
is
partially
true
of
deer
or
it
was
up
to
the
time
of
great
slaughter
it
is
said
that
in
deer
were
killed
in
montana
all
in
the
western
part
of
the
state
seventy
per
cent
of
which
were
the
deep
snows
and
extreme
cold
of
a
long
and
unusually
severe
winter
drove
the
hungry
deer
down
out
of
the
mountains
into
the
settlements
where
the
ranchmen
joyously
slaughtered
them
the
destruction
around
kalispell
was
described
by
harry
stanford
as
sickening
avare
estimates
the
antelope
in
montana
at
three
thousand
head
of
which
about
six
hundred
are
under
the
of
four
ranches
the
antelope
need
three
or
four
small
ranges
such
as
the
snow
creek
antelope
range
where
the
bad
lands
are
too
rough
for
ranchmen
but
quite
right
for
antelopes
and
other
big
game
all
the
grouse
and
ptarmigan
of
montana
need
a
close
season
the
splendid
sage
grouse
is
now
extinct
in
many
parts
of
its
previous
range
thousand
licensed
gunners
are
too
many
for
them
the
few
mountain
sheep
and
mountain
goats
that
survive
should
have
a
close
season
at
once
the
killing
of
female
hoofed
animals

be
prohibited
by

montana
has
not
yet
adopted
the
model

for
the
protection
of

only
seven
states
have
failed
in
that
respect
the
use

should
immediately
be
prohibited
montana
are
not
wholly
bad
but
the
grizzly

has
almost
been
exterminated
save
in
the
yellowstone
park
some
of
these
days
if
things
go
on
as
they
are
now
going
the
people
of
montana
will
be
rudely
awakened
to
the
fact
that
they
have
licensed
hunters
but
no
longer
any
killable
game
and
then
we
will
hear
enthusiastic
talk
about
restocking
nebraska

many
extinct
species

my
belief
that

outside

it
will
be
in

new
jersey
new
jersey
enjoys
the
distinction
of
being
the
second
state
to
break
the
of
the
of
hartford
and
ilion
and
cast
out
the
odious
automatic
and
pump
guns
it
was
a
pitched
battle
that
of
inaugurated
by
ernest
napier
president
of
the
state
game
and
fish
commission
and
his
fellow
commissioners
the
longer
the
contest
continued
the
more
did
the
press
and
the
people
of
new
jersey
awaken
to
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
finally
the
bill
passed
the
two
houses
of
the
legislature
with
a
total
of
only
fourteen
votes
against
it
and
after
a
full
hearing
had
been
granted
the
attorneys
of
the
gunmakers
was
promptly
signed
by
governor
woodrow
wilson
wilson
could
not
be
convinced
that
the
act
was
unconstitutional
or
confiscatory
or
class
legislation
this
contest
aroused
the
whole
state
to
the
imperative
necessity
of
providing
more
thorough
protection
for
the
remnant
of
new
jersey
game
and
it
was
chiefly
responsible
for
the
enactment
of
four
other
excellent
new
protective
laws
new
jersey
always
has
been
sincere
in
her
desire
to
protect
her
wild
life
and
always
has
gone
far
as
the
killers
of
game
would
permit
her
to
go
but
the
people
have
made
one
great
mistake
common
to
nearly
every
state
of
permitting
the
to
dictate
the
game
laws
and
everywhere
this
is
a
grievous
and
fatal
to
the
game
for
example
in
new
jersey
enacted
a
law
on
the
prairie
fowl
pinnated
grouse
but
it
was
too
late
to
save
it
now
that
species
is
as
dead
to
new
jersey
as
is
the
mastodon
the
moral
is
will
the
people
apply
this
lesson
to
the
ruffed
grouse
quail
and
the
shore
birds
generally
before
they
too
are
too
far
gone
to
be
brought
back
if
it
is
done
it
must
be
done
the
will
of
the
gunners
for
they
prefer
to
shoot
and
shoot
they
will
if
they
can
dictate
the
laws
until
the
last
game
bird
is
dead
in
new
jersey
is
spending
in
trying
to
restock
her
birdless
covers
with
foreign
game
birds
and
quail
in
brief
here
are
the
imperative
duties
of
new
jersey
provide
close
seasons
for
quail
ruffed
grouse
woodcock
snipe
all
shore
birds
and
the
prohibit
the
sale
of
all
native
wild
game
but
promote
the
sale
of
game
prevent
the
repeal
of
the
automatic
gun
law
which
surely
will
be
attempted
each
year
prohibit
all
after
january
each
year
until
fall
prohibit
the
killing
of
squirrels
as
game
new
mexico
all
things
considered
the
game
laws
of
new
mexico
are
surprisingly
up
to
date
and
the
state
is
to
be
congratulated
on
its
advanced
position
for
example
there
are
long
close
seasons
on
antelope
elk
now
extinct
mountain
sheep
bob
white
quail
pinnated
grouse
wild
pigeon
and
ptarmigan
an
admirable
list
truly
it
is
clear
that
new
mexico
is
wide
awake
to
the
dangers
of
the
situation
on
two
counts
her
laws
are
not
quite
perfect
there
is
no
law
prohibiting
spring
shooting
and
there
is
no
model
law
protecting
the
birds
the
sale
of
game
will
not
trouble
new
mexico
because
the
present
laws
prevent
the
sale
of
all
protected
game
except
plover
curlew
and
snipe
all
of
them
species
by
no
means
common
in
the
arid
regions
of
the
southwest
a
law
prohibiting
spring
shooting
of
shore
birds
and
waterfowl
should
be
passed
at
the
next
session
of
the
legislature
the
enactment
of
the
model
law
should
be
accomplished
without
delay
to
put
new
mexico
abreast
of
the
neighboring
states
of
colorado
oklahoma
and
texas
the
term
of
the
state
warden
should
be
extended
to
four
years
new
york
in
the
year
of
grace
i
think
we
may
justly
regard
new
york
as
the
banner
state
of
all
america
in
the
protection
of
game
and
wild
life
in
general
this
proud
position
has
been
achieved
partly
through
the
influence
of
a
great
conservation
governor
john
dix
and
the
state
conservation
commission
proposed
and
created
by
his
efforts
in
these
days
of
game
destruction
when
our
country
from
nome
to
key
west
is
reeking
with
the
blood
of
slaughtered
wild
creatures
it
is
a
privilege
and
a
pleasure
to
be
a
citizen
of
a
state
which
has
thoroughly
cleaned
house
and
done
well
nigh
the
utmost
that
any
state
can
do
to
clear
her
bad
record
and
give
all
her
wild
creatures
a
fair
chance
to
survive
the
people
of
the
empire
state
literally
can
point
with
pride
to
the
list
of
things
accomplished
in
the
discharge
of
toward
the
remnant
of
wild
life
and
toward
the
future
generations
of
new
yorkers
that
we
of
have
borne
our
share
of
the
burden
of
bringing
about
the
conditions
of
will
be
a
source
of
satisfaction
especially
when
the
sword
and
shield
hang
useless
upon
the
walls
of
old
age
new

began
to
protect
her

and

by

mclean
george
a
lawyer
and
john
burnham
this
code
contains
many
important
new
provisions
one
of
the
most
valuable
of
which
is
a
clause
giving
the
conservation
commission
power
at
its
discretion
to
shorten
or
to
close
any
open
season
on
any
species
of
game
in
any
locality
wherein
that
species
seems
to
be
threatened
with
extermination
this
very
valuable
principle
should
be
enacted
into
law
in
every
state
in
william
dutcher
and
gilbert

and
the
national

all
the

birds
quail

of

should
be
given
close
seasons
by
the
action
of

commission
for
the
good
name
of
the
state
and
the
ethical
standing
of
its
sportsmen
as
an
example
to
other
states
and
the

the

form
a

of
local
and
state
measures
effective
and
ineffective

were

and

the
ten
years

were
enacted
she
sedulously
endeavors
to
protect
her
quail
which
do
not
migrate
but
in

county
she
persistently
maintains
the
bloodiest
for
waterfowl
that
exists
anywhere
on
the
atlantic
coast
there
is
no
bag
limit
on
waterfowl
and
unlimited
spring
shooting
so
far
as
waterfowl
are
concerned
conditions
could
hardly
be
worse
except
by
the
use
of
punt
guns
doves
and
are
shot
and
eaten
as
game
from
november
to
march
counties
have
local
restrictions
on
the
sale
of

but
the
state
at
large
has
only
one
on
quail
the
market
gunners
of
currituck
sound
are
a
scourge
and
a
pest
to
the
life
of
the
atlantic
coast
for
their
own
money
profit
they
slaughter
by
wholesale
the
birds
that
annually
fly
through
states
it
is
quite
useless
to
suggest
anything
to
north
carolina
in
modern
game
laws
as
long
as
a
killable
bird
remains
she
will
not
stop
the
slaughter
her
standing
reply
is
it
brings
a
lot
of
money
into
currituck
county
and
the
people
want
the
money
even
the
members
of
the
sportsmen
clubs
can
shoot
wild
fowl
in
currituck
county
quite
without
limit
and
i
am
told
that
the
privilege
often
is
abused
quite
recently
i
heard
of
a
member
of
one
of
the
clubs
who
shot
ducks
and
geese
in
two
days
apparently
any
suggestions
made
to
north
carolina
would
not
be
treated
seriously
especially
if
they
would
tend
really
to
elevate
the
sport
of
game
shooting
or
better
protect
the
game
there
is
however
a
melancholy
interest
attached
to
the
framing
of
good
game
laws
whether
they
ever
are
likely
to
be
adopted
or
not
here
is
the
duty
of
north
carolina
stop
the
killing
of
robins
doves
and
larks
for
food
absolutely
and
forever
this
measure
is
necessary
to
agriculture
and
to
the
good
name
of
the
state
stop
the
shooting
of
any
game
for
sale
prohibit
the
possession
of
game
for
sale
and
the
sale
of
wild
native
game
establish
bag
limits
on
all
waterfowl
and
on
all
other
game
birds
and
mammals
prepare
to
protect
at
an
early
date
the
wild
turkey
and
quail
for
soon
they
will
need
it
moreover
enact
a
law
prohibiting
the
use
of
automatic
and
pump
guns
in
hunting
covering
the
entire
state
provide
a
system
and
thereby
make
the
game
department
and
render
it
possible
to
employ
a
salaried
state
game
commissioner
it
is
quite
wrong
for
the
people
of
north
carolina
to
hold
grudges
against
northern
members
of
the
ducking
clubs
of
currituck
for
the
passage
of
the
bayne
law
they
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
and
i
can
say
this
because
i
was
in
a
position
which
enabled
me
to
know
north
dakota
in
this
sovereign
state
enacted
a
law
the
use
of
in
hunting
also
rifles
north
dakota
was
the
first
state
to
recognize
officially
the
fact
that
the
use
of
automobiles
in
hunting
is
a
serious
menace
to
some
forms
of
wild
life
beyond
all
question
the
machines
do
indeed
bring
an
extra
number
of
birds
within
reach
of
the
gun
they
increase
the
annual
slaughter
and
it
is
right
and
necessary
to
prohibit
by
law
their
use
in
hunting
game
of
any
kind
in
putman
county
new
york
i
have
seen
them
in
action
a
load
of
three
or
four
gunners
is
whirled
up
to
a
likely
for
ruffed
grouse
and
presently
the
banging
begins
after
an
hour
or
so
spent
in
combing
out
the
birds
the
hunters
jump
in
whirl
away
in
a
to
another
spot
two
miles
away
and
again
after
that
a
third
locality
and
so
on
covering
six
or
eight
times
the
territory
that
a
man
in
a
buggy
or
on
foot
could
possibly
shoot
over
in
the
same
time
north
dakota
has
done
well
in
the
passage
of
that
act
on
certain
other
matters
she
is
not
so
sound
for
instance
the
killing
of
pinnated
grouse
should
be
stopped
for
ten
years
and
it
should
be
done
immediately
the
killing
of
cranes
as
game
should
stop
instantly
and
forever
it
is
barbarous
fifty
dead
birds
in
possession
at
one
time
is
fully
thirty
too
many
the
game
can
not
stand
such
slaughter
all
shore
birds
should
have
at
least
a
close
season
before
they
are
exterminated
the
use
of
machine
guns
in
hunting
should
be
stopped
forever
it
is
to
the
credit
of
the
state
that
antelope
are
absolutely
protected
until
and
an
unlimited
close
season
has
been
accorded
the
quail
dove
and
swan
ohio
i
think
that
ohio
comes
the
nearest
of
all
the
states
to
being
gameless
with
but
slight
exceptions
her
laws
are
about
as
correct
as
those
of
most
other
states
but
the
desire
to
kill
is
so
strong
and
the
majority
of
her
gunners
are
so
thoroughly
selfish
about
their
rights
that
the
game
has
ruthlessly
been
swept
away
to
law
ohio
is
a
striking
example
of
the
deplorable
results
of
slaughter
the
spirit
of
ohio
is
like
that
of
north
carolina
her
sportsmen
will
not
have
an
automatic
gun
law
oh
no
limit
the
bag
shorten
the
season
and
the
gun
wo
matter
the
visible
game
supply
of
ohio
does
not
amount
to
anything
and
when
the
last
game
bird
of
that
state
falls
before
the
greediest
shooter
we
shall
say
a
gameless
state
is
just
what
you
deserve
it
is
useless
to
make
any
suggestions
to
ohio
her
shooting
shylocks
want
the
last
pound
of
flesh
from
wild
life
and
i
think
they
will
get
it
very
soon
ohio
is
in
the
area
of
barren
states
the
seed
stock
has
been
too
thoroughly
destroyed
to
be
recuperated
i
think
that
last
noteworthy
exploit
in
lawmaking
for
the
preservation
of
her
game
was
in
when
she
put
all
her
shore
birds
into
the
list
of
killable
game
and
bravely
prohibited
the
shooting
of
doves
the
ground
great
is
ohio
in
game
conservation
oklahoma
for
a
state
so
young
the
laws
of
oklahoma
are
in
admirable
shape
but
it
is
reasonably
certain
that
there
as
elsewhere
the
game
is
being
killed
much
faster
than
it
is
breeding
the
new
commonwealth
must
arouse
and
screw
up
the
brakes
much
tighter
recently
an
observing
friend
told
me
that
on
a
trip
of
miles
westward
from
lawton
and
back
again
watching
sharply
for
game
all
the
way
he
saw
only
five
pinnated
grouse
and
this
in
a
good
season
for
prairie
chickens
oklahoma
must
stop
all
spring
shooting
the
prairie
chicken
must
have
a
close
season
immediately
next
time
her
legislature
will
pass
the
automatic
gun
bill
that
failed
last
year
only
because
the
session
closed
too
soon
for
its
consideration
oklahoma
is
wise
in
giving
long
protection
to
her
quail
and
wild
pigeon
and
such
protection
should
be
made
equally
effective
in
the
case
of
the
dove
she
is
wise
in
rigidly
enforcing
her
law
against
the
exportation
of
game
the
wichita
national
bison
herd
near
cache
now
contains
forty
head
of
bison
all
in
good
condition
the
nucleus
herd
consisted
of
fifteen
head
presented
by
the
new
york
zoological
society
in
oregon
the
results
of
the
efforts
that
have
been
made
by
oregon
to
provide
special
laws
for
each
individual
shooter
are
painful
to
contemplate
like
north
carolina
oregon
has
attempted
the
impossible
task
of
pleasing
everybody
and
at
the
same
time
protecting
her
wild
life
the
two
propositions
can
be
blended
together
about
as
easily
as
asphalt
and
water
the
individual
shooter
desires
laws
that
will
permit
him
to
shoot
he
pleases
he
pleases
and
he
pleases
if
you
meet
those
conditions
all
over
a
great
state
then
it
is
time
to
bid
farewell
to
the
game
for
it
surely
is
doomed
no
decidedly
no
do
not
attempt
to
pass
game
laws
that
will
please
everybody
the
more
the
are
the
better
for
the
game
the
form
a
very
small
and
very
insignificant
minority
of
the
whole
people
why
please
one
man
at
the

the
game
of
a
state
belongs
to
the
people
as
a
whole
not
to
the
gunners
alone
the
great
patient
and
sometimes
sleepy
majority
has
vested
rights
in
it
and
it
is
for
it
to
say
how
it
shall
and
shall
not
be
killed
heretofore
the
gunning
minority
has
been
dictating
the

the
result
is

oregon
should
bury
the
pernicious
idea
of

should
enact
a
concise
clearly
cut
and
thoroughly
effective
code
of
wild

laws
just
as

did
last

her

should
be

all
over

every
species
of

it

time
to

pennsylvania
is
a
close
second
to
new

and
massachusetts
she
protects
all
native

from

has
the
courage
to
prohibit
aliens
from
owning

she
bars
out

she
makes
refuges

her

in

and
she
permits
the
killing
of
no
female
deer
or
fawns
with
horns
less
than
three
inches
in

her
splendid
state

is
fighting
hard
for
a
hunter
license
law
and
will
win
the
fight
for
it
at
the
next
session
of
the
legislature
but
there
are
certain
things
that
pennsylvania
should
do
she
should
stop
all
spring
shooting
she
must
stop
killing
doves
blackbirds
wild
turkeys
sandpipers
and
all
the

she
should
give
all
her

rhode

she

some
to

come
down

foolish
and
tame
little

stop
it
at

for

of
the

enact
a

thus
provide

south

are
all
per

too
high
and
they
should
be
reduced
it
is
strange
to
see
one
of
the
oldest
of
the
states
lagging
in
game
protection
far
behind
such
new
states
as
new
mexico
and
oklahoma
but
south
carolina
does
lag
it
is
time
for
her
to
consider
her
position
and
reform
south
dakota
south
dakota
should
stop
all
spring
shooting
her
limits
are
really
no
limits
at
all
they
should
be
reduced
about
per
cent
without
a
moment
unnecessary
delay
the
two
year
term
of
the
state
warden
is
too
short
for
effective
work
it
should
be
extended
to
four
years
unless
south
dakota
wishes
to
repeat
the
folly
of
such
states
as
indiana
iowa
illinois
missouri
and
ohio
she
needs
to
be
up
and
doing
if
her
people
want
a
gameless
state
except
for
migratory
waterfowl
all
they
need
do
is
to
slumber
on
and
they
surely
will
have
it
why
wait
until
greedy
sportsmen
have
killed
the
last
game
bird
of
the
state
before
seriously
taking
the
matter
in
hand
in
one
act
all
the
shortcomings
of
the
present
laws
can
be
corrected
south
dakota
needs
no
bayne
law
because
she
prohibits
at
all
times
the

or
exportation
of
all

tennessee
in
wild
life
protection
tennessee
has
much
to
do
she
made
her
start
late
in
life
and
what
she
needs
to
do
is
to
draft
with
care
and
enact
with
cheerful
alacrity
certain
necessary
amendments
we
notice
that
there
are
open
seasons
for
robins
doves
and
it
seems
incredible
but
it
is
true
behold
the
blackbird
as
a
game
bird
with
a
lawful
open
season
from
september
to
january
consider
its
stately
carriage
its
rapid
flight
on
the
wing
its
running
and
hiding
powers
when
attacked
as
a
test
of
marksmanship
as
the
real
thing
for
the
expert
wing
shot
is
it
not
great
will
not
any
dog
be
proud
to
point
or
retrieve
them
and
what
flesh
for
the
table
fancy
an
sportsman
going
out
in
a
hunting
suit
carrying
a
gun
behind
a
dog
and
returning
with
a
glorious
bag
of
blackbirds
or
robins
or
doves
proud
indeed
would
we
be
to
belong
which
we
do
to
a
club
of
sportsmen
who
go
out
shooting
blackbirds
and
robins
and
foolish
little
doves
as
game
game
indeed
are
those
birds
for
little
lads
of
seven
who
do
not
know
better
but
not
for
boys
of
twelve
who
have
in
their
veins
any
inheritance
of
sporting
blood
i
am
proud
of
the
fact
that
at
twelve
years
of
age
and
ever
so
keen
to
go
hunting
i
knew
without
being
told
that
squirrels
and
doves
were
not
game
for
real
boys
the
killers
of
doves
squirrels
blackbirds
and
robins
belong
in
the
same
class
as
the
italians
of
venice
milan
and
turin
and
in
that
company
we
will
leave
them
tennessee
needs
a
resident
license
system
to
provide
funds
for

protection
a
salaried

force
a
law
prohibiting

texas
i
remember
well
when
the
great
battle
was
fought
in
texas
by
the
gallant
men
and
women
of
the
state
audubon
society
to
compel
the
people
of
texas
to
learn
the
economic
value
to
agriculture
and
cotton
of
the
insectivorous
birds
the
name
of
the
splendid
who
led
the
army
of
the
defense
was
capt
davis
that
was
in
since
that
great
fight
was
won
texas
has
been
a
partly
reformed
state
at
times
quite
jealous
of
her
bird
life
but
still
she
tolerates
spring
shooting
and
has
not
made
adequate
close
seasons
for
her
waterfowl
which
is
wrong
the
people
of
texas
do
not
need
to
be
told
that
species
of
birds
feed
on
the
cotton
boll
weevil
for
they
know
it
on
the
whole
and
for
a
southern
state
the
laws
of
texas
are
in
fairly
good
shape
on
account
of
the
absence
of
markets
a
bayne
law
is
not
so
imperatively
necessary
there
as
in
certain
other
states
all
the
game
of
the
state
is
protected
from
sale
we
do
assert
however
that
if
robins
are
slaughtered
as
crow
the
former
atlantan
asserts
all
robin
shooting
should
be
forever
stopped
that
the
pinnated
grouse
should
be
given
a
close
season
and
that
doves
should
be
taken
off
the
list
of
game
birds
and
perpetually
protected
both
for
economic
and
sentimental
reasons
and
also
because
the
too
weak
and
confiding
dove
is
not
a
game
bird
for
men
texas
should
enact
without
delay
a
law
providing
close
seasons
for
ducks
geese
and
other
waterfowl
a
law
prohibiting
spring
shooting
and
a
provision
reducing
the
limit
on
deer
to
two
bucks
a
season
utah
the
laws
of
utah
are
far
from
being
up
to
the
requirements
of
the
present
hour
one
strange
thing
has
happened
in
utah
when
i
spent
a
week
in
salt
lake
city
in
and
devoted
some
time
to
inquiring
into
game
conditions
the
laws
of
the
state
were
very
bad
at
the
mouth
of
bear
river
ducks
were
being
slaughtered
for
the
markets
by
the
tens
of
thousands
the
wide
open
and
utterly
shameless
way
in
which
it
was
being
done
right
at
the
doors
of
salt
lake
city
was
appalling
at
the
same
time
the
law
permitted
the
slaughter
of
i
saw
a
huge
drygoods
box
filled
to
the
top
with
the
flat
skins
of
slaughtered
innocents
in
that
a
rascal
had
collected
and
was
offering
at
fifty
cents
each
in
reply
to
a
question
as
to
their
use
he
said
i
tink
de
sportsmen
like
for
to
make
vests
oud
of
he
lived
at
rawlins
wyo
after
a
long
and
somnolent
period
during
which
hundreds
of
thousands
of
ducks
geese
brant
and
other
birds
had
been
slaughtered
for
market
at
the
bear
river
shambles
and
elsewhere
the
state
awoke
sufficiently
to
abate
a
portion
of
the
disgrace
by
passing
a
law
and
then
came
nature
punishment
upon
utah
for
that
duck
slaughter
the
ducks
of
great
salt
lake
became
afflicted
with
a
terrible
epidemic
disease
intestinal
coccidiosis
which
swept
off
thousands
and
stopped
the
use
of
utah
ducks
as
food
it
was
a
duck
plague
no
less
it
has
prevailed
for
three
years
and
has
not
yet
by
any
means
been
stamped
out
it
seems
to
be
due
to
the
fact
that
countless
thousands
of
ducks
have
been
feeding
on
the
exposed
alluvial
flats
at
the
mouth
of
the
creek
that
drains
off
the
of
salt
lake
the
conditions
are
said
to
be
terrible
utah
is
so
nearly
destitute
of
big
game
that
the
subject
is
hardly
worthy
of
mention
of
her
upland
game
birds
only
a
fraction
remains
and
as
her
laws
stand
she
is
destined
to
become
in
the
near
future
a
gameless
state
in
a
dry
region
like
this
the
wild
life
always
hangs
on
by
a
slender
thread
and
it
is
easy
to
exterminate
it
utah
should
instantly
stop
the
sale
of
game
that
she
now
legally
provides
for
shore
birds
and
waterfowl
per
day
to
private
parties
deer
should
be
given
a
close
season
at
once
all
bag
limits
should
instantly
be
reduced
the
sage
grouse
quail
swans
woodcock
dove
and
all
shore
birds
should
be
given
a
close
season
and
rigidly
protected
before
the
stock
is
all
gone
the
model
law
for
the
protection
of
birds
should
be
enacted
at
once
the
absolute
protection
of
elk
antelope
and
sheep
until
should
be
extended
for
twenty
years
utah
should
create
a
preserve
at
once
if
utah
proposes
to
save
even
a
remnant
of
her
wild
life
for
posterity
she
must
be
up
and
doing
vermont
in
view
of
all
conditions
it
must
be
stated
that
the
game
laws
of
vermont
are
with
but
slight
exceptions
in
good
condition
it
is
a
pleasure
to
see
that
there
is
no
spring
shooting
that
there
is
no
open
season
of
slaughter
for
the
moose
caribou
swan
upland
plover
dove
or
rail
that
no
buck
deer
with
antlers
less
than
three
inches
long
may
be
killed
and
that
there
is
a
law
under
which
damages
by
deer
to
growing
crops
may
be
assessed
and
paid
for
by
the
county
in
which
they
occur
moreover
if
there
is
to
be
any
killing
of
game
her
bag
limits
are
not
extravagant
all
the
game
protected
by
the
state
is
immune
from
sale
for
food
purposes
but
game
may
legally
be
sold
we
recommend
the
following
new
measures
absolute
close
seasons
of
duration
for
ruffed
grouse
quail
woodcock
snipe
and
all
shore
birds
without
a
single
exception
the
gray
squirrel
should
be
perpetually
protected
because
he
is
too
beautiful
too
companionable
and
too
unfit
for
food
to
be
killed
even
the
hungry
savages
of
the
east
indies
do
not
eat
squirrels
pass
an
automatic
law
extend
the
term
of
the
fish
and
game
commissioner
to
four
years
vermont
great
success
in
introducing
and
colonizing
deer
is
both
interesting
and
valuable
fifty
years
ago
she
had
no
wild
deer
because
the
species
had
been
practically
exterminated
in
thirteen
deer
were
imported
from
the
adirondacks
and
set
free
in
the
mountains
the
increase
has
been
enormous
in
the
number
of
deer
killed
for
the
year
was
about
which
was
possible
without
adversely
affecting
the
herds
it
is
a
striking
in
restoring
the
deer
to
its
own
and
it
will
be
found
more
fully
described
in
chapter
xxiv
virginia
virginia
is
far
below
the
position
that
she
should
occupy
in
conservation
to
set
her
house
in
order
and
come
up
to
the
level
of
the
states
that
have
been
born
during
the
past
twenty
years
she
must
bestir
herself
in
these
ways
she
must
provide
for
a
resident
hunting
license
a
state
game
commissioner
and
a
force
of
salaried
wardens
she
must
prohibit
spring
shooting
she
must
impose
small
bag
limits
on
she
must
resolutely
stop
the
sale
of
all
wild
game
she
must
stop
the
killing
of
female
deer
and
of
bucks
with
horns
under
three
inches
long
she
must
stop
killing
gray
squirrels
and
doves
as
game
she
should
not
permit
the
beautiful
to
be
killed
as
game
she
should
accord
a
close
season
to
grouse
and
all
shore
birds
she
should
rule
out
the
machine
which
gentlemen
can
no
longer
use
in
hunting
she
should
adopt
at
once
a
comprehensive
code
of
game
laws
and
clean
her
house
in
one
siege
instead
of
fiddling
and
fussing
with
all
these
matters
one
by
one
through
a
series
of
ten
long
weary
years
the
time
for
puttering
with
game
protection
has
gone
by
it
is
now
time
to
make
short
cuts
to
comprehensive
results
and
save
the
game
before
it
is
too
late
washington
the
state
of
washington
still
flatters
herself
that
she
has
all
kinds
of
big
game
to
kill
moose
antelope
goat
sheep
caribou
and
deer
evidently
this
is
on
the
theory
that
so
long
as
a
species
is
not
extinct
it
is
legal
and
right
to
pursue
it
with
rifles
during
a
specified
open
season
the
people
of
washington
need
to
be
told
that
conditions
have
greatly
changed
and
it
is
now
high
time
to
put
on
the
brakes
it
is
time
for
them
to
realize
that
if
they
wait
any
longer
for
the
sportsmen
to
take
the
initiative
in
securing
the
enactment
of
really
adequate
preservation
laws
all
their
big
game
will
be
dead
before
those
laws
are
born
every
man
shrinks
from
cutting
off
his
own
pet
privilege
some
of
the
game
laws
of
washington
are
up
to
date
and
her
laws
look
all
right
to
the
unaided
eye
but
are
not
her
bird
laws
are
a
chaotic
jumble
of
local
exceptions
and
special
privileges
as
a
net
result
of
all
her
shortcomings
the
remnant
of
a
once
fine
fauna
of
big
game
and
feathered
game
is
surely
being
according
to
a
few
local
exceptions
will
not
disprove
the
general
truthfulness
of
this
assertion
ten
years
ago
a
few
men
in
seattle
resented
the
idea
of
outside
in
the
protection
of
washington
game
they
said
they
were
abundantly
able
to
take
care
of
it
but
the
march
of
events
has
proven
that
they
overestimated
their
capacity
the
laws
of
that
state
are
only
half
baked
come
what
may
to
me
i
shall
set
down
without
malice
the
things
that
the
great
and
admirable
state
of
washington
should
do
to
set
her
house
in
order
it
is
not
good
for
the
resourceful
and
progressive
men
of
the
great
northwest
to
be
clear
behind
the
times
in
these
matters
local
game
legislation
and
enact
a
code
of
laws
covering
the
entire
state
uniformly
county
legislation
is
twenty
years
behind
the
times
for
ten
full
years
stop
the
killing
of
elk
mountain
sheep
mountain
goat
caribou
moose
and
antelope
regarding
deer
i
am
in
doubt
prohibit
the
sale
of
all
wild
game
no
matter

the
enactment
of

which
will
also
promote

for

a
careful
investigation
of
the
present
status
of
your
sage

every
other

all
species
of

birds
then
give
a
close

all
over
the

to
every
species
that
is
becoming
scarce
this
will
embrace
certainly
of
the
whole
number
if
not
provide
two
bird
refuges
in
the
eastern
portion
of
the
state
where
they
are
very
greatly
needed
to
supplement
the
good
effects
of
the
state
game
preserve
established
on
puget
sound
in
bar
the
use
in
hunting
of
the
odious
automatic
and
pump
shotguns
that
are
now
so
generally
in
use
all
over
the
united
states
to
the
great
detriment
of
the
game
and
the
people
west
virginia
considering
the
fact
that
west
virginia
contains
no
city
for
the
consumption
of
commercial
wild
game
that
the
sale
of
all
game
is
prohibited
at
all
times
and
the
game
of
the
state
may
not
be
exported
for
sale
elsewhere
the
wild
life
of
west
virginia
is
reasonably
secure
from
the
market
gunner
if
an
adequate
salaried
warden
force
is
provided
without
such
a
force
her
game
must
continue
to
be
destroyed
in
the
future
as
in
the
past
to
supply
the
markets
of
pittsburgh
philadelphia
baltimore
and
washington
the
deer
law
is
excellent
and
the
birds
and
the
dove
and
are
perpetually
protected
one
fly
in
the
ointment
is
spring
shooting
which
for
ducks
geese
and
brant
continues
from
september
to
april
unfortunately
the
law
enacted
in
against
spring
shooting
has
been
and
so
has
the
resident
hunting
license
law
in
view
of
the
impossibility
of
imagining
a
good
reason
for
the
repeal
of
a
good
law
we
recommend
that
the
law
against
spring
shooting
be
that
the
resident
hunter
license
law
be
and
the
proceeds
specifically
devoted
to
the
preservation
and
increase
of
game
that
a
force
of
regular
salaried
wardens
be
provided
to
enforce
the
laws
that
the
bag
limit
on
quail
should
be
per
day
or
per
season
instead
of
and
and
on
ruffed
grouse
it
should
be
per
day
as
in
new
york
or
per
season
one
wild
turkey
per
day
or
three
per
season
is
quite
enough
for
one
man
the
visible
supply
will
not
justify
the
existing
limit
of
two
and
six
wisconsin
in
spite
of
the
fierce
fight
made
in
by
the
of
milwaukee
for
the
control
of
the
situation
and
the
repeal
of
the
best
protective
laws
of
the
state
the
army
of
defense
once
more
defeated
the
allied
destroyers
and
drove
them
off
the
field
once
more
it
was
proven
that
when
the
people
are
aroused
they
are
abundantly
able
to
send
the
steam
roller
over
the
enemies
of
wild
life
alphabetically
wisconsin
may
come
near
the
end
of
the
but
by
downright
merit
in
protection
she
comes
mighty
close
to
the
head
of
the
list
of
states
her
slate
of
work
to
be
done
is
particularly
clean
and
she
has
our
most
distinguished
admiration
her
force
of
game
wardens
is
not
a
force
it
amounts
to
something
the

who
get
within

wisconsin
has
a
good
series
of
game
laws
but
the
hour
for
a
reformation
of
ideas
and
principles
has
struck
we
heard
it
first
in
april
the
wild
life
of
america
must
not
be
exterminated
according
to
law
contrary
to
law
or
in
the
absence
of
law
wisconsin
must
take
a
fresh
grip
on
her
game
situation
or
it
will
get
away
from
her
after
all
not

and

any

scarce
that
the

needs
to
be
cut
down
to
five
as
it
now
is
for
the
above
in
wisconsin
it
is
time
to
stop
for
ten
years
before
it
is
too
late
wisconsin
should
immediately
busy
herself
about
the
creation
of
bird
and
game

for
goodness
sake
wisconsin
stop
killing
squirrels
as
game
you
ought
to
know
better
and
you
do
leave
that
form
of
barbarism
for
the
benighted
states
and
pass
a
law
shutting
out
the
machine

they
are
a
disgrace

scourge

a
magnificent
heritage
of

it
embraced
the
rocky
mountain
species
and
also
those
of
the
great
plains
first
and
last
the
state
has
worked
hard
to
protect
her
wild
life
and
hold
the
killing
of
it
down
to
a
decent
basis
as
far
back
as
i
met
on
the
shoshone
river
a
very
warden
actually
on
his
job
who
was
maintained
by
a
body
of
private
citizens
headed
by
pickett
and
known
as
the
northern
wyoming
game
protective
association
and
even
then
we
saw
that
the
laws
were
too
liberal
for
the
game
in
one
man
we
saw
enough

law
and

we
are
assuming
that
the
american
people
sincerely
desire
the
adequate
protection
and
increase
of
bird
life
for
reasons
that
are
both
sentimental
and
commercial
surely
every
good
citizen
dislikes
to
see
millions
of
dollar
worth
of
national
wealth
foolishly
wasted
and
he
dislikes
to
pay
any
unnecessary
increased
cost
of
living
there
must
be
several
millions
of
americans
who
feel
that
way
and
who
are
disposed
to
demand
a
complete
revolution
in
bird
protection
there
are
four
needs
of
wild
bird
life
that
are
fundamental
and
that
can
not
be
ignored
any
more
than
a
builder
can
ignore
the
four
cornerstones
of
his
building
listed
in
the
order
of
their
importance
they
are
as
follows
federal
protection
of
all
migratory
total
suppression
of
the
sale
of
native
wild
total
suppression
of
spring
shooting
and
of
shooting
in
the
breeding
season
close
seasons
for
all
species
that
are
about
to
be
shot
if
the
gunners
of
america
wish
to
have
a
gameless
continent
all
they
need
do
to
secure
it
is
to
oppose
these
principles
prevent
their
translation
into
law
and
maintain
the
status
quo
if
they
do
this
then
our
best
birds
are
doomed
to
swift
let
no
man
make
a
mistake
on
that
point
the
open
seasons
and
bag
limits
of
the
united
states
are
just
as
deadly
as
the
sporting
guns
now
in
use
and
the
annual
cartridges
it
is
only
the
ignorant
or
the
vicious
who
will
seriously
dispute
this
statement
the
federal
protection
of
migratory
the
bill
now
before
congress
for
the
protection
of
all
migratory
birds
by
the
national
government
is
the
most
important
measure
ever
placed
before
that
body
in
behalf
of
wild
life
a
stranger
to
this
proposition
will
need
to
pause
for
thought
in
order
to
grasp
its
full
meaning
and
appreciate
the
magnitude
of
its
influence
the
urgent
necessity
for
a
law
of
this
nature
is
due
to
the
utter
inadequacy
of
the
laws
that
prevail
throughout
some
portions
of
the
united
states
concerning
the
slaughter
and
preservation
of
birds
any
law
that
is
not
enforced
is
a
poor
law
there
is
not
one
state
in
the
union
nor
a
single
province
in
canada
in
which
the
game
birds
and
other
birds
criminally
shot
as
game
are
not
being
killed
far
faster
than
they
are
breeding
and
thereby
being
exterminated
several
states
are
financially
unable
to
employ
a
force
of
salaried
game
wardens
and
wherever
that
is
true
the
door
to
universal
slaughter
is
wide
open
let
him
who
questions
this
take
virginia
as
a
case
in
point
a
loyal
virginian
told
me
only
this
year
that
in
his
state
the
warden
system
is
an
ineffective
farce
and
the
game
is
not
protected
because
the
wardens
can
not
afford
to
patrol
the
state
for
nothing
this
condition
prevails
in
a
number
of
states
north
and
south
especially
south
it
is
my
belief
that
throughout
of
the
south
the
negroes
and
poor
whites
are
slaughtering
birds
exactly
as
they
please
it
is
the
of
the
haunts
of
birds
and
game
that
are
exterminating
the
wild
life
the
value
of
the
birds
as
destroyers
of
noxious
insects
has
been
set
forth
in
chapter
xxiii
their
total
value
is
enormous
or
it
be
if
the
birds
were
alive
and
here
in
their
normal
numbers
there
are
about
as
many
birds
as
were
alive
and
working
thirty
years
ago
during
the
past
thirty
years
the
destruction
of
our
game
birds
has
been
enormous
and
the
insectivorous
birds
have
greatly
decreased
the
damages
annually
inflicted
upon
the
farm
orchard
and
garden
crops
of
this
country
are
very
great
when
a
city
is
destroyed
by
earthquake
or
fire
and
worth
of
property
is
swept
away
we
are
racked
with
horror
and
pity
and
the
cities
of
america
pour
out
money
like
water
to
relieve
the
resultant
distress
we
are
shocked
because
we
can
the
flames
the
smoke
and
the
ruins
and
yet
we
annually
endure
with
perfect
equanimity
we
can
not
see
a
loss
of
nearly
worth
of
value
that
is
destroyed
by
insects
the
damage
is
inflicted
silently
insidiously
without
any
scare
heads
or
wooden
type
in
the
newspapers
and
so
we
pay
the
price
without
protest
we
know
when
we
stop
to
think
of
it
that
not
all
this
loss
falls
upon
the
producer
we
know
that
every
consumer
of
bread
cereals
vegetables
and
fruit
his
share
of
this
millions
of
people
are
groaning
under
the
increased
cost
of
living
the
bill
for
the
federal
protection
of
all
migratory
birds
is
directly
intended
to
decrease
the
cost
of
living
by
preventing
outrageous
waste
but
of
all
the
persons
to
whom
the
needs
of
that
bill
are
presented
how
many
will
take
the
time
to
promote
its
quick
passage
by
direct
appeals
to
their
members
of
congress
we
shall
see
the
good
that
would
be
accomplished
annually
by
the
enactment
of
a
law
for
the
federal
protection
of
all
migratory
birds
is
beyond
computation
but
it
is
my
belief
that
within
a
very
few
years
the
increase
in
bird
life
would
prevent
what
is
now
an
annual
loss
of
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
man
to
protect
his
crops
and
fruit
and
trees
as
the
bird
millions
would
protect
them
if
they
were
here
as
they
were
in
the
migratory
bird
bill
is
of
vast
importance
because
it
would
throw
the
strong
arm
of
federal
protection
around
species
of
birds
the
power
of
uncle
sam
is
respected
and
feared
in
many
places
where
the
power
of
the
state
is
ignored
the
list
of
migratory
birds
includes
most
of
the
perching
birds
all
the
shore
birds
destroyers
of
bad
insects
all
the
swifts
and
swallows
the
whippoorwill
and
nighthawk
some
of
the
woodpeckers
most
of
the
rails
pigeons
and
doves
many
of
the
hawks
some
of
the
cranes
and
herons
and
all
the
geese
ducks
and
swans
a
movement
for
the
federal
protection
of
migratory
game
birds
was
proposed
to
congress
by
george
shiras
who
as
a
member
of
the
house
in
the
congress
introduced
a
bill
to
secure
that
end
an
excellent
brief
on
that
subject
by
shiras
appeared
in
the
printed
hearing
on
the
mclean
bill
held
on
march
page
omitting
the
bills
introduced
in
the
and
sessions
mention
need
be
made
only
of
the
measures
under
consideration
in
the
present
congress
one
of
these
is
a
bill
introduced
by
representative
weeks
of
massachusetts
and
another
is
the
bill
of
representative
anthony
of
kansas
of
the
same
purport
finally
on
april
an
adequate
and
entirely
reasonable
bill
was
introduced
in
the
senate
by
senator
george
mclean
of
connecticut
as
no
calendar
no
this
bill
provides
federal
protection
for
migratory
birds
and
embraces
all
save
a
very
few
of
the
species
that
are
specially
destructive
to
noxious
insects
the
bill
provides
national
protection
to
the
farmer
and
best
friends
it
is
entitled
to
the
enthusiastic
support
of
of
people
native
and
alien
every
producer
of
farm
products
and
every
consumer
of
them
owes
it
to
himself
to
write
at
once
to
his
member
of
congress
and
ask
him
to
urge
the
speedy
consideration
of
the
bill
for
the
federal
protection
of
all
migratory
birds
to
vote
for
it
and
to
work
for
it
until
it
is
passed
it
matters
not
which
one
of
the
three
bills
described
finally
becomes
a
law
will
the
american
people
act
rationally
about
this
matter
and
protect
their
own
interests
suppress
the
sale
of
all
native
wild
the
deadly
effect
of
the
commercial
slaughter
of
game
and
its
sale
for
food
is
now
becoming
well
understood
by
the
american
people
one
by
one
the
various
state
legislatures
have
been
putting
up
the
bars
against
the
exportation
or
sale
of
any
game
protected
by
the
state
the
department
of
agriculture
says
through
henry
oldys
that
free
marketing
of
wild
game
leads
swiftly
to
extermination
and
it
is
literally
true
up
to
march
it
appears
that
several
states
prohibited
the
sale
of
game
sixteen
states
permitted
the
sale
of
all
unprotected
game
and
in
eight
more
there
was
partial
prohibition
unfortunately
however
many
of
these
states
permitted
the
sale
of
game
now
since
it
happened
to
be
a
fact
that
the
vast
majority
of
the
states
prohibit
the
of
their
game
as
well
as
the
sale
of
it
a
very
large
quantity
of
such
game
as
quail
ruffed
grouse
snipe
woodcock
and
shore
birds
was
illegally
shot
for
the
market
exported
in
defiance
both
of
state
laws
and
the
federal
lacey
act
and
sold
to
the
detriment
of
the
states
that
produced
it
in
other
words
in
the
laws
of
each
state
that
merely
sought
to
protect
game
regardless
of
the
game
of
neighboring
states
there
was
not
merely
a
but
there
was
a
gap
wide
enough
to
drive
through
with
a
coach
and
four
the
ruffed
grouse
of
massachusetts
and
connecticut
often
were
butchered
to
make
gotham
holidays
in
joyous
contempt
of
the
laws
at
both
ends
of
the
line
as
a
natural
result
the
game
of
the
atlantic
coast
was
disappearing
at
a
frightful
rate

eighteen
states
entirely
prohibit
the

why
do
the
others
lag
behind
in
the
law
of
new
york
was
born
out
of
sheer
desperation
the
army
of
destruction
went
up
to
albany
well
provided
with
money
and
attorneys
with
three
senators
in
the
senate
and
two
assemblymen
in
the
lower
house
to
wage
merciless
warfare
on
the
whole
cause
the
market
gunners
and
game
dealers
not
only
proposed
to
repeal
the
law
against
spring
shooting
but
also
to
defeat
all
legislation
that
might
be
attempted
to
restrict
the
sale
of
game
or
impose
bag
limits
on
wild
fowl
the
milliners
association
proposed
to
wipe
off
the
books
the
dutcher
law
against
the
use
of
the
plumage
of
wild
birds
in
millinery
and
an
assemblyman
was
committed
to
that
cause
as
its
special
champion
then
it
was
that
all
the
friends
of
wild
life
in
the
empire
state
resolved
upon
a
death
grapple
with
the
destroyers
and
a
fight
to
an
absolute
finish
the
bayne
bill
entirely
prohibiting
the
sale
of
all
native
wild
game
throughout
the
state
of
new
york
was
drafted
and
thrown
into
the
ring
and
the
struggle
began
at
first
the
bill
looked
like
sheer
madness
but
no
sooner
was
it
fairly
launched
than
supporters
came
flocking
in
from
every
side
all
the
organizations
of
sportsmen
and
friends
of
wild
life
combined
in
one
mighty
army
the
strength
of
which
was
irresistible
the
real
sportsmen
of
the
state
quickly
realized
that
the
bill
was
in
the
interest
of
legitimate
the
great
mass
of
people
who
love
wild
life
and
never
kill
were
quick
to
comprehend
the
importance
of
the
measure
and
they
supported
it
with
money
and
enthusiasm
the
members
of
the
legislature
received
thousands
of
letters
from
their
constituents
asking
them
to
support
the
bill
they
did
so
on
its
passage
through
the
two
houses
only
vote
was
recorded
against
it
incidentally
every
move
attempted
by
the
army
of
destruction
was
defeated
and
in
the
final
summing
up
the
defeat
amounted
to
an
utter
rout
in
after
a
tremendous
struggle
the
legislature
of
massachusetts
passed
a
counterpart
of
the
bayne
law
and
took
her
place
in
the
front
rank
of
states
that
was
a
great
fight
the
of
cape
cod
the
game
dealers
and
other
interests
entered
the
struggle
with
men
in
the
lower
house
of
the
legislature
specially
elected
to
look
after
their
interests
just
as
in
new
york
in
they
proposed
to
repeal
the
existing
laws
against
spring
shooting
and
throw
the
markets
wide
open
to
the
sale
of
game
from
first
to
last
through
three
long
and
stormy
months
the
destroyers
fought
with
a
degree
of
determination
and
persistence
worthy
of
a
better
cause
they
contested
with
the
defenders
every
inch
of
ground
in
new
york
the
destroyers
were
overwhelmed
by
the
tidal
wave
of
defenders
but
in
massachusetts
it
was
a
prolonged
fight
on
the
ramparts
was
a
bill
to
repeal
the
law
introduced
and
defeated
even
after
the
bill
had
passed
both
houses
by
good
majorities
the
governor
declared
that
he
could
not
sign
it
and
then
there
poured
into
the
executive
offices
such
a
flood
of
callers
letters
telegrams
and
telephone
calls
that
he
became
convinced
that
the
people
desired
the
law
so
he
signed
the
bill
in
deference
to
the
wishes
of
the
majority
the
principle
that
the
sale
of
game
is
wrong
and
fatal
to
the
existence
of
a
supply
of
game
is
as
fixed
and
unassailable
as
the
rocky
mountains
its
universal
acceptance
is
only
a
question
of
intelligence
and
common
honesty
the
open
states
owe
it
to
themselves
and
each
other
to
enact
both
the
spirit
and
the
letter
of
the
bayne
law
do
it
before
it
is
too
late
to
profit
by
it
let
them
remember
the
heath
hen
amply
protected
when
entirely
too
late
to
save
it
from
extinction
it
is
fairly
beyond
question
that
the
killing
of
wild
game
for
the
market
and
its
sale
in
the
open
season
out
of
is
responsible
for
the
disappearance
of
at
least
fifty
per
cent
of
our
stock
of
american
feathered
game
it
is
the
the
who
shoots
for
sport
and
sells
his
game
and
the

who
have
swept
away
the
wild
ducks
the
ruffed
grouse
the
quail
and
the
prairie
chickens
that
thirty
years
ago
were
abundant
on
their
natural

the
foolish
farmers
of

permitted
the
of
chicago

to
slaughter

all
laws
that
permit
the
killing
of

for

and
the
sale
of
it
afterward
are
class
legislation
of
the
worst
sort
they
permit
a
hundred
men
selfishly
to
slaughter

any

the

that

as

from

they

wild
game
is
no
longer
necessary
as
food
to
satisfy
hunger
and
ward
off
starvation
in
the
united
states
the
day
of
the
hungry
pioneer
has
gone

there
is
an
abundance
of
food
everywhere
the
time
to
temporize
and
feel
timid
over
the
game
situation
has
gone
by
the
situation
is
desperate
and
nothing
but
strong
and
vigorous
measures
will
avail
anything
worth
while
the
sale
of
all
wild
game
should
be
stopped
everywhere
and
at
all
seasons
throughout
all
north
america
and
throughout
the
world
this
particular
curse
is
being
felt
even
in
india
it
is
the
duty
of
every
true
sportsman
every
farmer
who
owns
a
gun
and
every
lover
of
wild
life
to
enter
into
the
campaign
for
the
passage
of
bills
absolutely
prohibiting
all
traffic
in
wild
game
no
matter
what
its
origin
of
course
the
market
hunters
the
and
the
game
dealers
will
bitterly
oppose
them
and
hire
a
lobby
to
attempt
to
defeat
them
but
the
fight
for
is
now
on
and
it
must
not
stop
short
of
complete
victory
reasons
why
the
sale
of
wild
game
should
cease
everywhere
because
fully
per
cent
of
our
legitimate
stock
of
feathered
game
has
already
been
destroyed
because
if
and
the
sale
of
game
continue
ten
years
longer
all
our
feathered
game
will
be
swept
away
because
when
the
sale
of
game
was
permitted
one
dealer
was
able
to
sell
birds
per
year
in
new
york
so
he
himself
said
because
it
is
a
fixed
fact
that
every
wild
species
of
mammal
bird
or
reptile
that
is
pursued
for
purposes
eventually
is
wiped
out
of
existence
even
the
whales
of
the
sea
are
no
exception
because
at
least
per
cent
of
the
decrease
in
our
feathered
game
is
due
to
and
the
sale
of
game
look
at
the
prairie
chicken
of
the
mississippi
valley
and
the
ruffed
grouse
of
new
england
because
the
laws
that
permit
the
commercial
slaughter
of
wild
birds
for
the
benefit
of
less
than
five
per
cent
of
the
inhabitants
of
any
state
are
directly
against
the
interest
of
the
per
cent
of
other
people
to
that
game
partly
because
game
killed
for
sale
is
not
intended
to
satisfy
hunger
the
people
who
eat
game
in
large
cities
do
not
know
what
hunger
is
save
by
hearsay
purchased
game
is
used
chiefly
in
and
as
a
rule
it
does
far
more
harm
than
good
because
the
greatest
value
to
be
derived
from
any
game
bird
is
in
seeing
it
and
photographing
it
and
enjoying
its
living
company
in
its
native
haunts
who
will
love
the
forests
when
they
become
destitute
of
wild
life
and
desolate
because
stopping
the
sale
of
game
help
bring
back
the
game
birds
to
us
in
a
few
because
the
pace
that
new
york
and
massachusetts
have
set
in
this
matter
will
render
it
easier
to
procure
the
passage
of
bayne
laws
in
other
states
because
those
who
legitimately
desire
game
for
their
tables
can
be
supplied
from
the
game
farms
and
preserves
that
now
are
coming
into
existence
when

the

slaughter
that

prevailed
in

been
checked

an
instance

persistent
market
shooting
on

ducking
waters
of

eastern
united
states
i
offer
this
report
from
a
trustworthy
agent
sent
to
currituck
sound
north
carolina
in
march
i
beg
to
submit
the
following
information
relative
to
the
number
of
wild
ducks
and
geese
shipped
from
this
market
and
killed
in
the
waters
of
back
bay
and
the
upper
or
north
end
of
currituck
sound
from
october
to
march
inclusive
approximately
there
were
killed
and
shipped
in
the
territory
above
named
to
wild
ducks
and
between
and
wild
geese
from
currituck
sound
and
its
tributaries
there
were
shipped
approximately
wild
ducks
you
will
see
from
the
above
figures
that
each
year
the
market
shooter
exacts
a
tremendous
toll
from
the
wild
water
fowl
in
these
waters
and
it
is
only
a
question
of
a
short
time
when
the
wild
duck
will
be
exterminated
unless
we
can
stop
the
ruthless
slaughter
the
last
few
years
i
have
noted
a
great
decrease
in
the
number
of
wild
ducks
some
of
the
species
are
practically
extinct
i
have
secured
the
above
information
from
a
most
reliable
source
and
the
figures
given
approximately
can
not
be
questioned
the
effect
of
the
passage
of
the
bayne
law
closing
the
greatest
american
market
against
the
sale
of
game
was
an
immediate
decrease
of
fully
fifty
per
cent
in
the
number
of
ducks
and
geese
slaughtered
on
currituck
sound
the
dealers
refused
to
buy
the
birds
and
the
killers
were
compelled
to
hang
up
their
guns
and
go
to
work
the
felt
very
much
enraged
by
the
passage
of
the
law
and
at
first
were
inclined
to
blame
the
northern
members
of
currituck
ducking
clubs
for
the
passage
of
the
measure
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
not
one
of
the
persons
blamed
took
any
part
whatever
in
the
campaign
for
the
new
law
the
unfairness
of
spring
the
shooting
of
game
birds
in
late
winter
and
spring
is
to
be
mentioned
only
to
be
condemned
it
is
grossly
unfair
to
the
birds
outrageous
in
principle
and
most
unsportsmanlike
no
matter
whether
the
law
permits
it
or
not
why
it
is
that
any
state
like
iowa
for
example
can
go
on
killing
game
in
spring
is
more
than
i
can
understand
i
have
endeavored
to
find
a
reason
for
it
in
iowa
but
the
only
real
reason
is
the
boys
want
the
birds
i
think
we
have
at
last
reached
the
point
where
it
may
truthfully
be
said
that
now
no
gentleman
shoots
birds
in
spring
if
the
plea
is
made
that
if
we
do
shoot
ducks
in
the
spring
we
ca
shoot
them
at
all
then
the
answer
is
if
you
ca
shoot
game
like
sportsman
shoot
it
at
a
gentleman
can
not
afford
to
barter
his
standing
and
his
own
for
a
few
ducks
shot
in
the
spring
when
the
birds
are
going
north
to
lay
their
eggs
and
the
man
who
insists
on
shooting
in
spring
may
just
as
well
go
right
on
and
do
various
other
things
that
are
beyond
the
pale
such
as
shoot
quail
on
the
ground
shoot
does
and
fawns
and
fish
for
trout
with
gang
hooks
there
are
no
longer
two
sides
to
what
once
was
the
spring
shooting
question
even
among
savages
the
breeding
period
of
the
wild
creatures
is
under
taboo
then
if
ever
may
the
beasts
and
birds
cry
excuse
it
has
been
positively
stated
in
print
that
fox
hounds
have
been
known
to
refuse
to
chase
a
pregnant
fox
even
when
in
full
view
chapter
xxxiii
bringing
back
the
vanished
birds
and
game
the
most
charming
trait
of
character
is
the
alacrity
and
confidence
with
which
wild
birds
and
mammals
respond
to
the
friendly
advances
of
human
friends
those
who
are
not
very
familiar
with
the
mental
traits
of
our
wild
neighbors
may
at
first
find
it
difficult
to
comprehend
the
marvelous
celerity
with
which
both
birds
and
mammals
recognize
friendly
overtures
from
man
and
respond
to
them
at
the
present
juncture
this
state
of
the
mind
becomes
a
factor
of
great
importance
in
determining
what
we
can
do
to
prevent
the
extermination
of
species
and
to
promote
the
increase
and
return
of
wild
life
i
think
that
there
is
not
a
single
wild
mammal
or
bird
species
now
living
that
can
not
or
does
not
quickly
recognize
protection
take
advantage
of
the
most
conspicuous
of
all
familiar
examples
are
the
wild
animals
of
the
yellowstone
park
they
embrace
the
elk
mountain
sheep
antelope
mule
deer
the
black
bear
and
even
the
grizzly
no
one
can
say
precisely
how
long
those
several
species
were
in
ascertaining
that
it
was
safe
to
trust
themselves
within
easy
of
man
but
i
think
it
was
about
five
years
birds
recognize
protection
far
more
quickly
than
mammals
in
a
comparatively
short
time
the
naturally
wild
and
wary
big
game
of
the
yellowstone
park
became
about
as
tame
as
range
cattle
it
was
at
least
fifteen
years
ago
that
the
mule
deer
began
to
frequent
the
parade
ground
at
the
mammoth
hot
springs
military
post
and
receive
there
their
rations
of
hay
whenever
you
see
a
beautiful
photograph
of
a
large
band
of
sheep
or
mule
deer
taken
at
short
range
amid
rocky
mountain
scenery
you
are
safe
in
labeling
it
as
having
come
from
the
yellowstone
park
the
antelope
herd
is
so
tame
that
it
is
difficult
to
keep
it
out
of
the
streets
of
gardiner
on
the
montana
side
of
the
line
but
the
bears
who
has
not
heard
the
story
of
the
bears
of
the
yellowstone
park
how
black
bears
and
grizzlies
stalk
out
of
the
woods
every
day
to
the
garbage
how
black
bears
actually
have
come
the
for
food
without
breaking
the
truce
and
how
the
grizzlies
boldly
raid
the
and
of
campers
taking
just
what
they
please
because
they
that
no
man
dares
to
shoot
them
indeed
those
raiding
bears
long
ago
became
a
public
nuisance
and
many
of
them
have
been
caught
in
steel
and
shipped
to
zoological
gardens
in
order
to
get
them
out
of
the
way
and
yet
outside
the
park
boundaries
everywhere
the
bears
are
as
wary
and
wild
as
the
wildest
the
arrogance
of
the
bears
that
could
be
shot
once
led
to
a
droll
and
also
exciting
episode
during
the
period
when
jones
buffalo
jones
was
superintendent
of
the
wild
animals
of
the
park
the
indignities
inflicted
upon
tourist
campers
by
certain
grizzly
bears
quite
abraded
his
nerves
he
obtained
from
major
pitcher
authority
to
punish
and
reform
a
certain
grizzly
and
went
about
the
matter
in
a
thoroughly
manner
he
procured
a
strong
lariat
and
a
seven
feet
long
and
repaired
to
the
camp
that
was
troubled
by
too
much
grizzly
the
particular
offender
was
a
male
grizzly
who
had
become
a
notorious
raider
at
the
psychological
moment
jones
lassoed
him
in
short
order
getting
a
firm
hold
on
the
bear
left
hind
leg
quickly
the
end
of
the
rope
was
thrown
over
a
limb
of
the
nearest
tree
and
in
a
trice
ephraim
found
himself
swinging
head
downward
between
the
heavens
and
the
earth
and
then
his
punishment
began
buffalo
jones
thrashed
him
soundly
with
the
the
outraged
bear
swung
to
and
fro
whirled
round
and
round
clawing
and
snapping
at
the
empty
air
roaring
and
bawling
with
rage
scourged
in
flesh
and
insulted
in
spirit
as
he
swung
the
searched
out
the
different
parts
of
his
anatomy
with
a
wonderful
degree
of
neatness
and
precision
between
rage
and
indignation
the
grizzly
nearly
exploded
a
camera
was
there
and
since
that
day
that
truly
moving
scene
has
amazed
and
thrilled
countless
thousands
of
people
when
it
was
over
jones
boldly
turned
the
bear
loose
although
its
rage
was
as
boundless
as
the
glories
of
the
yellowstone
park
it
paused
not
to
rend
any
of
those
present
but
headed
for
the
tall
timber
and
with
many
an
indignant
woof
woof
it
plunged
in
and
disappeared
it
was
two
or
three
years
before
that
locality
was
again
troubled
by
impudent
grizzly
bears
and
what
is
the
mental
attitude
of
rocky
mountain
black
or
grizzly
bear
of
the
yellowstone
park
it
is
colossal
suspicion
of
man
perpetual
fear
and
a
clean
pair
of
heels
the
moment
or
proclaims
the
proximity
of
the
arch
enemy
of
wild
creatures
and
yet
there
are
one
or
two
men
who
tell
the
american
public
that
wild
animals
do
not
think
that
they
do
not
reason
and
are
governed
only
by
instinct
a
little
knowledge
is
a
dangerous
thing
taming
wild
as
incontestable
proof
of
the
receptive
faculties
of
birds
i
will
cite
the
taming
of
wild
birds
in
the
open
by
friendly
advances
there
are
hundreds
aye
thousands
of
men
women
boys
and
girls
who
could
give
interesting
and
valuable
personal
testimony
on
this
point
my
friend
alden
loring
one
of
the
naturalists
of
the
roosevelt
african
expedition
is
an
ardent
lover
of
wild
birds
and
mammals
the
taming
of
wild
creatures
in
the
open
is
one
of
his
pastimes
and
his
results
serve
well
to
illustrate
the
marvelous
readiness
of
our
wild
neighbors
to
become
close
friends
with
man
i
will
quote
from
one
of
loring
letters
on
this
subject
taming
wild
birds
is
a
new
field
in
nature
study
and
one
never
can
tell
what
success
he
will
have
until
he
has
experimented
with
different
species
some
birds
tame
much
more
easily
than
others
on
three
or
four
occasions
i
have
enticed
a
chickadee
my
at
the
first
attempt
while
in
other
cases
it
has
taken
from
fifteen
minutes
to
a
whole
day
chipping
sparrows
that
frequent
my
doorway
i
have
tamed
in
two
days
a
nuthatch
required
three
hours
before
it
would
fly
to
my
hand
although
it
took
food
from
my
stick
the
first
time
it
was
offered
when
you
find
a
bird
on
her
nest
it
is
of
course
much
easier
to
tame
that
individual
than
if
you
had
to
follow
it
about
in
the
open
and
wait
for
it
to
come
within
reach
of
a
stick
by
exercising
extreme
caution
and
approaching
inch
by
inch
i
have
climbed
a
tree
to
the
nest
of
a
vireo
and
at
the
first
attempt
handed
the
bird
a
with
my
fingers
at
one
time
i
had
two
house
wrens
a
vireo
a
chipping
sparrow
and
a
flock
of
chickadees
that
would
come
to
my
hand
illustration

with

it
would
be
possible
and
also
delightful
to
fill
a
volume
with
citations
of
evidence
to
illustrate
the
quick
acceptance
of
protection
by
wild
birds
and
mammals
let
me
draw
a
few
illustrations
from
my
own
wild
neighbors
on
lake
agassiz
in
the
zoological
park
within
feet
of
my
office
in
the
administration
building
a
pair
of
wild
made
their
nest
last
spring
and
have
just
finished
rearing
nine
fine
healthy
young
birds
whenever
you
see
a
rise
and
fly
in
our
park
you
may
know
that
it
is
a
wild
bird
during
the
summer
of
a
small
flock
of
wild
came
every
night
to
our
pond
and
spent
the
night
there
a
year
ago
a
covey
of
eleven
quail
appeared
in
the
park
and
have
persistently
remained
ever
since
last
fall
and
winter
they
came
at
least
twenty
times
to
a
spot
within
forty
feet
of
the
rear
window
of
my
office
in
order
to
feed
upon
the
wheat
screenings
that
we
placed
there
for
them
when
we
first
occupied
the
zoological
park
grounds
in
there
was
not
one
wild
rabbit
in
the
whole
acres
presently
the
species
appeared
and
rabbits
began
to
hop
about
confidently
all
over
the
place
in
we
estimated
that
there
were
about
eighty
individuals
then
the
marauding
cats
began
to
come
in
and
they
killed
off
the
rabbits
until
not
one
was
to
be
seen
thereupon
we
addressed
ourselves
to
those
cats
in
more
serious
earnest
than
ever
before
now
the
cats
have
disappeared
and
one
day
last
spring
as
i
left
my
office
at
six
everyone
else
having
previously
gone
i
almost
stepped
upon
two
bunnies
that
had
been
visiting
on
the
front
when
we
were
macadamizing
the
yards
around
the
elephant
house
with
a
throng
of
workmen
all
about
every
day
a
robin
made
its
nest
on
the
heavy
frame
of
one
of
the
large
elephant
gates
that
swung
to
and
fro
nearly
every
day
in
we
planted
a
young
pine
tree
in

of
our
temporary
office

came
under
my
notice
in
the
pages
of
recreation
magazine
in
june
when
that
publication
was
edited
by
shields
the
article
was
entitled
a
haven
of
refuge
and
the
place
described
well
deserved
the
name
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
impress
upon
the
readers
of
this
volume
with
sufficient
force
and
clearness
the
splendid
success
that
is
easily
attainable
in
encouraging
the
return
of
the
birds
the
story
of
the
mosca
haven
of
refuge
was
so
well
told
by
charles
townsend
in
the
publication
referred
to
above
that
i
take
pleasure
in
reproducing
it
entire
one
mile
north
of
the
little
village
of
mosca
colorado
in
san
luis
valley
lives
the
family
of
gray
on
the
gray
ranch
there
is
an
artesian
well
which
empties
into
a
small
pond
about
feet
square
this
pond
is
never
entirely
frozen
over
and
the
water
emptying
therein
is
warm
even
during
the
coldest
winter
some
five
years
ago
gray
secured
a
few
eggs
and
hatched
them
under
a
hen
the
little
ducks
were
reared
and
fed
on
the
little
pond
the
following
spring
they
left
the
place
to
return
in
the
fall
bringing
with
them
broods
of
young
also
bringing
other
ducks
to
the
home
where
protection
was
afforded
them
and
plenty
of
good
feed
was
provided
each
year
since
the
ducks
have
scattered
in
the
spring
to
mate
and
rear
their
families
returning
again
with
greatly
increased
numbers
in
the
fall
and
again
bringing
strangers
to
the
haven
of
refuge
i
drove
out
to
the
ranch
november
and
found
the
little
pond
almost
black
with
the
birds
and
was
fortunate
enough
to
secure
a
picture
of
a
part
of
the
pond
while
the
ducks
were
thickly
gathered
thereon
ice
had
formed
around
the
edges
and
this
ice
was
covered
with
ducks
the
water
was
also
alive
with
others
which
paid
not
the
least
attention
to
the
party
of
strangers
on
the
shore
from
gray
i
learned
that
there
were
some
ducks
of
various
kinds
on
the
pond
at
that
time
though
it
was
then
early
for
them
to
seek
winter
quarters
later
in
the
year
he
assured
me
there
would
be
between
and
teal
mallards
redheads
and
other
varieties
all
perfectly
at
home
and
fearless
of
danger
the
family
have
habitually
approached
the
pond
from
the
house
which
stands
on
the
south
side
and
should
any
person
appear
on
the
north
side
of
the
pond
the
ducks
immediately
take
fright
and
flight
wheat
was
strewn
on
the
ground
and
in
the
water
and
the
ducks
waddled
around
us
within
a
few
inches
of
our
feet
to
feed
paying
not
the
least
attention
to
us
or
to
the
old
which
walked
near
six
miles
east
of
the
ranch
is
san
luis
lake
to
which
these
ducks
travel
almost
daily
while
the
lake
is
open
when
they
are
at
the
lake
it
is
impossible
to
approach
within
gunshot
of
the
then
timid
birds
some
unsympathetic
boys
and
men
have
learned
the
habit
of
the
birds
and
place
themselves
in
hiding
along
the
course
of
flight
to
and
from
the
lake
many
ducks
are
shot
in
this
way
but
woe
to
the
person
caught
firing
a
gun
on
or
near
the
when
away
from
home
the
birds
are
as
other
and
fail
to
recognize
any
members
of
the
gray
family
while
at
home
they
follow
the
boys
around
the
squawking
for
feed
like
so
many
tame
ducks
this
is
the
greatest
sight
i
have
ever
witnessed
and
one
that
i
could
not
believe
existed
until
i
had
seen
it
certainly
it
is
worth
travelling
many
miles
to
see
and
no
one
after
seeing
it
would
care
to
shoot
birds
that
when
kindly
treated
make
such
charming
pets
since
the
above
was
published
the
protected
flocks
of
tame
wild
ducks
have
become
one
of
the
most
interesting
sights
of
florida
at
palm
beach
the
tameness
of
the
wild
ducks
when
within
their
protected
area
and
their
wildness
outside
of
it
has
been
witnessed
by
thousands
of
visitors
the
saving
of
the
snowy
egret
in
the
united
the
time
was
when
very
many
persons
believed
that
the
devastations
of
the
of
florida
and
the
gulf
coast
would
be
so
long
continued
and
so
persistently
followed
up
to
the
logical
conclusion
that
both
species
of
egrets
would
disappear
from
the
avifauna
of
the
united
states
this
expectation
gave
rise
to
feelings
of
resentment
indignation
and
despair
it
happened
however
that
almost
at
the
last
moment
a
solitary
individual
set
on
foot
an
enterprise
calculated
to
preserve
the
snowy
egret
which
is
the
smaller
of
the
two
species
involved
from
final
extermination
the
splendid
success
that
has
attended
the
efforts
of
edward
mcilhenny
of
avery
island
louisiana
is
entitled
not
only
to
admiration
and
praise
but
also
to
the
higher
tribute
of
practical
imitation
mcilhenny
is
first
of
all
a
lover
of
birds
and
a
humanitarian
he
has
traveled
widely
throughout
the
continent
of
north
america
and
elsewhere
and
has
seen
much
of
wild
life
and
influence
upon
it
his
highest
ambition
is
to
create
for
the
benefit
of
the
present
and
as
a
heritage
to
posterity
a
chain
of
great
bird
refuges
in
which
migrating
wild
fowl
and
birds
of
all
other
species
may
find
and
refuges
during
their
migrations
and
protected
in
winter
in
this
grand
enterprise
the
consummation
of
which
is
now
in
progress
mcilhenny
is
associated
with
charles
willis
ward
joint
donor
of
the
splendid
bird
preserve
of
acres
which
recently
was
presented
to
the
state
of
louisiana
by
its
former
owners
the
egret
and
heron
preserve
however
is
mcilhenny
individual
enterprise
and
really
furnished
the
motif
of
the
larger
movement
of
its
inception
and
development
he
has
kindly
furnished
me
the
following
account
accompanied
by
many
beautiful
photographs
of
egrets
breeding
in
sanctuary
one
of
which
appears
on
page
in
some
recent
publications
i
have
seen
statements
to
the
effect
that
you
believed
the
egrets
were
nearing
extinction
owing
to
the
persecution
of
plume
hunters
so
i
know
that
you
will
be
interested
in
the
enclosed
photographs
which
were
taken
in
my
heron
rookery
situated
within
yards
of
my
factory
where
i
am
now
sitting
dictating
this
letter
this
rookery
was
started
by
me
in
because
i
saw
at
that
time
that
the
herons
of
louisiana
were
being
rapidly
exterminated
by
plume
hunters
my
thought
was
that
the
way
to
preserve
them
would
be
to
start
an
artificial
rookery
of
them
where
they
could
be
thoroughly
protected
with
this
end
in
view
i
built
a
small
pond
taking
in
a
wet
space
that
contained
a
few
willows
and
other
shrubs
which
grow
in
wet
places
in
a
large
cage
in
this
pond
i
raised
some
snowy
herons
after
keeping
the
birds
in
confinement
for
something
over
six
months
i
turned
them
loose
hoping
that
they
would
come
back
the
next
season
as
they
were
perfectly
tame
and
were
used
to
seeing
people
i
was
rewarded
the
next
season
by
four
of
the
birds
returning
and
nesting
in
the
willows
in
the
pond
this
was
the
start
of
a
rookery
that
now
covers
acres
and
contains
more
than
twenty
thousand
pairs
of
nesting
birds
embracing
not
only
the
egrets
but
all
the
species
of
herons
found
in
louisiana
besides
many
other
water
birds
with
a
view
to
carrying
on
the
preservation
of
our
birds
on
a
larger
scale
chas
ward
and
i
have
recently
donated
to
the
state
of
louisiana
acres
of
what
i
consider
to
be
the
finest
wild
fowl
feeding
ground
on
the
louisiana
coast
as
it
contains
the
only
gravel
beach
for
miles
and
all
of
the
geese
within
that
space
come
daily
to
this
beach
for
gravel
this
territory
also
produces
a
great
amount
of
natural
food
for
geese
and
ducks
saving
the
gulls
and
but
for
the
vigorous
and
efforts
of
the
audubon
societies
i
think
our
coasts
would
by
this
time
have
been
swept
clean
of
the
gulls
and
terns
that
now
adorn
it
twenty
years
ago
the
milliners
were
determined
to
have
them
all
the
fight
for
them
was
long
and
hotly
contested
but
the
audubon
societies
won
it
was
a
great
victory
and
has
yielded
results
of
great
value
to
the
country
at
large
and
yet
it
was
only
a
small
number
of
persons
who
furnished
the
money
and
made
the
fight
which
inured
to
the
benefit
of
the
millions
of
american
people
hereafter
whenever
you
see
an
american
gull
or
tern
remind
yourself
that
it
was
saved
to
the
nation
by
the
audubon
people
in
times
of
grave
emergency
such
as
fire
war
and
scarcity
of
food
the
wild
creatures
forget
their
fear
of
man
and
many
times
actually
surrender
themselves
to
his
mercy
and
protection
at
such
times
hard
is
the
heart
and
low
is
the
code
of
manly
honor
that
does
not
respond
in
a
manner
becoming
a
superior
species
the
most
pathetic
situation
ever
seen
in
the
united
states
on
a
large
scale
is
that
which
for
six
winters
in
succession
forced
several
thousand
starving
elk
into
the
settlement
of
jackson
hole
wyoming
in
quest
of
food
at
the
hands
of
their
natural
enemies
the
elk
lost
all
fear
partly
because
they
were
not
attacked
and
they
surrounded
the
haystacks
barns
and
houses
mutely
begging
for
food
previous
to
the
winter
of
thousands
of
weak
calves
and
cows
perished
around
the
haystacks
leek
wonderful
pictures
tell
a
thrilling
but
very
sad
story
to
the
everlasting
honor
of
the
people
of
jackson
hole
be
it
recorded
that
they
rose
like
men
to
the
occasion
that
confronted
them
in
they
gave
to
the
elk
herds
all
the
hay
that
their
domestic
stock
could
spare
not
pausing
to
ascertain
whether
they
ever
would
be
reimbursed
for
it
they
just
handed
it
out
the
famishing
animals
literally
mobbed
the
the
national
government
has
the
situation
in
hand
in
times
of
peace
and
plenty
the
people
of
jackson
hole
take
their
toll
of
the
elk
herds
but
their
example
during
starvation
periods
is
to
be
commended
to
all
men
a
slaughter
of
restored
the
case
of
the
chamois
in
switzerland
teaches
the
world
a
valuable
lesson
in
how
to
slaughter
game
that
has
come
back
to
its
haunts
through
protected
breeding
a
few
years
ago
one
of
the
provinces
of
switzerland
took
note
of
the
fact
that
its
stock
of
chamois
was
almost
extinct
and
enacted
a
law
by
which
the
remnant
was
absolutely
protected
for
a
long
period
during
those
years
of
protection
the
animals
bred
and
multiplied
until
finally
the
original
number
was
almost
restored
then
as
always
in
such
cases
there
arose
a
strong
demand
for
an
open
season
and
eventually
the
government
yielded
to
the
pressure
of
the
hunters
and
fixed
a
date
whereon
an
open
season
should
begin
illustration
gulls
and
terns
of
our
coasts
saved
from
destruction
these
birds
have
been
saved
and
brought
back
to
us
by
the
splendid
efforts
of
the
audubon
societies
and
other
but
for
the
laws
not
one
gull
or
tern
would
now
remain
on
our
atlantic
coast
from
the
american
natural
history
during
the
period
preceding
that
fatal
date
the
living
chamois
grown
half
tame
by
years
of
immunity
from
the
guns
were
all
carefully
located
and
marked
down
by
those
who
intended
to
hunt
them
at
daybreak
on
the
fatal
day
the
onset
began
guns
and
hunters
were
everywhere
and
the
mountains
resounded
with
the
fusillade
hundreds
of
chamois
were
slain
by
hundreds
of
hunters
and
by
the
close
of
that
fatal
open
season
the
species
was
more
nearly
exterminated
throughout
that
region
than
ever
before
once
more
those
mountains
were
nice
and
barren
of
game
let
that
bloody
and
disgraceful
episode
serve
as
a
warning
to
americans
who
are
tempted
to
demand
an
open
season
on
game
that
has
bred
back
from
the
verge
of
extinction
particularly
do
we
commend
it
to
the
notice
of
the
people
of
colorado
who
are
demanding
an
open
season
on
the
preserved
mountain
sheep
of
that
state
the
granting
of
such
an
open
season
would
be
a
brutal
outrage
those
sheep
are
now
so
tame
and
unsuspicious
that
the
killing
of
them
would
be
murder
the
logical
within
reasonable
limits
any
wild
species
can
be
increased
and
brought
back
by
giving
absolute
protection
from
harassment
and
slaughter
when
a
species
is
struggling
to
recuperate
it
deserves
to
be
left
until
it
is
once
more
on
safe
ground
every
breeding
wild
animal
craves
seclusion
and
entire
immunity
from
excitement
and
all
forms
of
molestation
nature
simply
demands
this
as
her
unassailable
right
it
is
my
firm
belief
that
any
wild
species
will
breed
in
captivity
whenever
its
members
are
given
a
degree
of
seclusion
that
they
deem
satisfactory
with
species
that
have
not
been
shot
down
to
a
point
entirely
too
low
adequate
protection
generously
long
in
duration
will
bring
back
their
numbers
if
the
people
of
the
united
states
so
willed
it
we
could
have
wild
deer
in
every
state
and
in
every
county
save
city
counties
between
the
atlantic
and
the
rocky
mountains
we
could
easily
have
one
thousand
bob
white
quail
for
every
one
now
living
we
could
have
squirrels
in
every
grove
and
songbirds
by
the
million
merely
by
protecting
them
from
slaughter
and
molestation
from
ohio
to
the
great
plains
the
pinnated
grouse
could
be
made
far
more
common
than
crows
and
blackbirds
inasmuch
as
all
this
is
true
and
no
one
with
information
will
dispute
it
for
a
moment
is
it
not
folly
to
seek
to
supplant
our
own
splendid
native
species
of
game
birds
we
never
yet
have
decently
protected
with
foreign
species
let
the
american
people
answer
this
question
with
yes
or
no
the
methods
by
which
our
birds
can
be
encouraged
and
brought
back
are
very
simple
protect
them
put
up
shelters
for
them
give
them
in
abundance
protect
them
from
cats
dogs
and
all
other
forms
of
destruction
and
feed
those
that
need
to
be
fed
i
should
think
that
every
boy
living
in
the
country
would
find
keen
pleasure
in
making
and
erecting
for
martins
wrens
and
squirrels
in
putting
up
straw
teepees
in
winter
for
the
quail
in
feeding
the
quail
and
in
nailing
to
the
trees
chunks
of
suet
and
fat
pork
every
winter
for
the
woodpeckers
nuthatches
and
other
winter
residents
will
any
person
now
on
this
earth
live
long
enough
to
see
the
present
and
devilish
spirit
of
slaughter
so
replaced
by
the
love
of
wild
creatures
and
the
true
spirit
of
conservation
that
it
will
be
as
rare
as
it
now
is
common
but
let
no
one
think
for
a
moment
that
any
vanishing
species
can
at
any
time
be
brought
back
for
that
would
be
a
grave
error
the
point
is
always
reached
by
every
such
species
that
the
survivors
are
too
few
to
cope
with
circumstances
and
recovery
is
impossible
the
heath
hen
could
not
be
brought
back
neither
could
the
passenger
pigeon
the
whooping
crane
the
sage
grouse
the
trumpeter
swan
the
wild
turkey
and
the
upland
plover
never
will
come
back
to
us
and
nothing
that
we
can
do
ever
will
bring
them
back
circumstances
are
against
those
species
and
i
fear
against
many
others
also
thanks
to
the
fact
that
the
american
bison
breeds
well
in
captivity
we
have
saved
that
species
from
complete
extinction
but
our
antelope
seems
to
be
doomed
it
is
because
of
the
alarming
condition
of
our
best
wild
life
that
quick
action
and
strong
action
is
vitally
necessary
we
are
sleeping
on
our
possibilities
chapter
xxxiv
introduced
species
that
have
been
beneficial
man
has
made
numerous
experiments
in
the
transplantation
of
wild
species
of
mammals
and
birds
from
one
country
or
continent
to
another
about
these
efforts
have
been
beneficial
and
the
other
half
have
resulted
disastrously
the
transplantation
of
any
species
is
a
leap
in
the
dark
on
general
principles
it
is
dangerous
to
meddle
with
the
laws
of
nature
and
attempt
to
improve
upon
the
code
of
the
wilderness
our
best
wisdom
in
such
matters
may
easily
prove
to
be
folly
the
trouble
lies
in
the
fact
that
concerning
transplantation
it
is
for
us
to
know
beforehand
all
the
conditions
that
will
affect
it
or
that
it
will
effect
and
how
it
will
work
in
its
own
home
a
species
may
not
only
harmless
but
actually
beneficial
to
man
we
do
not
know
and
can
not
all
the
influences
that
keep
it
in
check
and
that
mould
its
character
we
do
not
know
and
we
can
not
know
without
a
trial
how
new
environment
will
affect
it
and
what
new
traits
of
character
it
will
develop
under
radically
different
conditions
the
gentle
dove
of
europe
may
become
the
tyrant
dove
of
cathay
the
repressed
rabbit
of
the
old
world
becomes
in
australia
the
uncontrollable
rabbit
a
devastator
and
a
pest
of
pests
no
wild
species
should
be
transplanted
and
set
free
in
a
wild
state
to
stock
new
regions
without
consulting
men
of
wisdom
and
following
their
advice
it
is
now
against
the
laws
of
the
united
states
to
introduce
and
acclimatize
in
a
wild
state
anywhere
in
the
united
states
any
species
without
the
approval
of
the
department
of
agriculture
the
law
is
a
wise
one
furthermore
the
same
principle
should
apply
to
birds
that
it
is
proposed
to
transplant
from
one
portion
of
the
united
states
into
another
especially
when
the
two
are
widely
separated
on
this
point
i
once
learned
a
valuable
lesson
which
may
well
point
my
present
moral
incidentally
also
it
was
a
narrow
escape
for
me
a
gentlemen
of
my
acquaintance
who
admires
the
european
magpie
and
is
well
aware
of
its
acceptable
residence
in
various
countries
in
europe
once
requested
my
cooperation
in
securing
and
acclimatizing
at
his
country
estate
a
number
of
birds
of
that
species
as
in
duty
bound
i
laid
the
matter
before
our
department
of
agriculture
and
asked
for
an
opinion
the
department
replied
in
effect
why
import
a
foreign
magpie
when
we
have
in
the
west
a
species
of
our
own
quite
as
handsome
and
which
could
more
easily
be
transplanted
the
point
seemed
well
taken
now
i
had
seen
much
of
the
american
magpie
in
its
wild
home
the
rocky
mountains
and
the
western
border
of
the
great
plains
and
i
i
was
acquainted
with
it
i
knew
that
a
few
complaints
against
it
had
been
made
but
they
had
seemed
to
me
very
trivial
to
me
our
magpie
seemed
to
have
a
generally
unobjectionable
record
fortunately
for
me
i
wrote
to
hershey
assistant
curator
of
ornithology
in
the
colorado
state
museum
for
assistance
in
procuring
fifty
birds
for
transplantation
to
the
state
of
new
york
hershey
replied
that
if
i
really
wished
the
birds
for
acclimatization
he
would
gladly
procure
them
for
me
but
he
said
that
in
the
farming
of
colorado
the
magpie
is
now
regarded
as
a
pest
it
devours
the
eggs
and
nestlings
of
other
wild
birds
and
not
only
that
it
destroys
so
many
eggs
of
domestic
poultry
that
many
farmers
are
compelled
to
keep
their
hens
shut
up
in
wire
enclosures
now
this
condition
happened
to
be
entirely
unknown
to
me
because
i
never
had
seen
the
american
magpie
in
action
a
farming
of
course
the
proposed
experiment
was
promptly
abandoned
but
it
is
embarrassing
to
think
how
near
i
came
to
making
a
mistake
even
if
the
magpies
had
been
transplanted
and
had
become
a
nuisance
in
this
state
they
could
easily
have
been
exterminated
by
shooting
but
the
memory
of
the
error
would
have
been
humiliating
to
the
party
of
the
first
part
the
old
world
pheasants
in
in
the
first
chinese
pheasants
were
introduced
into
the
united
states
twelve
miles
below
portland
oregon
twelve
males
and
three
females
the
next
year
oregon
gave
pheasants
a
close
season
a
little
later
the
golden
and
silver
pheasants
of
china
were
introduced
and
all
three
species
throve
mightily
on
the
pacific
coast
in
oregon
washington
and
western
british
columbia
in
the
sportsmen
of
portland
and
vancouver
were
shooting
cock
golden
pheasants
according
to
law
the
success
of
chinese
and
japanese
pheasants
on
the
pacific
coast
soon
led
to
experiments
in
the
more
progressive
states
at
state
expense
state
pheasant
hatcheries
have
been
established
in
massachusetts
connecticut
new
york
new
jersey
ohio
illinois
missouri
iowa
and
california
in
many
localities
the
pheasants
have
come
to
stay
the
rise
and
progress
of
the
in
western
new
york
has
already
been
noted
it
came
about
merely
through
protection
that
protection
was
protection
in
fact
not
the
false
protection
that
shoots
on
the
sly
it
is
the
irony
of
fate
that
full
protection
should
be
accorded
a
foreign
bird
in
order
that
it
may
multiply
and
possess
the
land
while
the
same
kind
of
protection
is
refused
the
native
bob
white
and
it
is
now
almost
a
dead
species
so
far
as
this
state
is
concerned
in
looking
about
for
grievances
against
the
and
english
pheasant
some
persons
have
claimed
that
in
winter
these
birds
are
budders
which
means
that
they
harmfully
strip
trees
and
bushes
of
the
buds
that
those
bushes
will
surely
need
in
their
spring
opening
on
that
point
joseph
kalbfus
secretary
of
the
pennsylvania
game
commission
sent
out
a
circular
letter
of
inquiry
in
response
to
which
he
received
many
statements
with
but
one
exception
all
the
testimony
received
was
to
the
effect
that
pheasants
are
and
that
generally
the
charge
is
unfounded
the
introduction
of
pheasants
and
the
attempted
introduction
of
the
hungarian
partridge
are
efforts
designed
first
of
all
to
furnish
sportsmen
something
to
shoot
and
incidentally
to
provide
a
new
food
supply
for
the
table
the
people
of
this
country
are
not
starving
nor
are
they
even
very
hungry
for
the
meat
of
strange
birds
but
as
a
the
pheasant
is
all
right
it
disgusts
me
to
the
core
however
to
see
states
that
wantonly
and
wickedly
through
sheer
apathy
and
lack
of
business
enterprise
have
allowed
the
quail
the
heath
hen
the
pinnated
grouse
and
the
ruffed
grouse
to
become
almost
exterminated
by
extravagant
and
foolish
shooters
now
putting
forth
wonderfully
diligent
efforts
and
spending
money
without
end
in
introducing
species
many
men
actually
take
the
ground
that
our
game
ca
live
in
its
own
country
any
longer
but
only
the
ignorant
and
the
unthinking
will
say
so
give
our
game
birds
decent
sensible
protection
stop
their
being
slaughtered
far
faster
than
they
breed
and
will
live
anywhere
in
their
own
native
but
where
is
there
of
upland
game
bird
in
america
that
has
been
sensibly
and
adequately
protected
from
portland
maine
to
portland
oregon
there
is
one
not
a
single
locality
in
which
protection
from
shooting
has
been
sensible
or
just
or
we
have
universally
given
our
american
upland
game
birds
an
unfair
deal
and
now
we
are
adding
insult
to
slaughter
by
bringing
in
foreign
game
birds
to
replace
them
because
our
birds
ca
live
before
five
million
our
american
game
birds
can
live
anywhere
in
the
haunts
where
nature
placed
them
that
are
not
actually
occupied
by
cities
and
towns
give
me
the
making
of
the
laws
and
i
will
make
the
prairie
chicken
and
quail
as
numerous
throughout
the
northern
states
east
of
the
great
plains
as
domestic
chickens
are
outside
the
regular
poultry
farms
there
is
only
one
reason
why
there
are
not
ten
million
quail
in
the
state
of
new
york
one
for
each
human
inhabitant
and
that
reason
is
the
infernal
greed
and
selfishness
of
the
men
who
have
almost
exterminated
our
quail
by
do
talk
to
me
about
the
hard
winters
killing
off
our
quail
it
is
the
hard
cheek
of
the
men
who
shoot
them
when
they
ought
to
let
them
alone
the
state
of
iowa
could
support
prairie
chickens
and
never
miss
the
waste
grain
that
they
would
glean
in
the
fields
but
now
the
prairie
chicken
is
practically
extinct
in
iowa
only
a
few
scattered
specimens
remaining
as
last
survivors
in
some
of
the
northern
counties
the
migration
of
those
birds
that
unexpectedly
came
down
from
the
north
last
winter
was
like
the
fall
of
a
meteor
only
the
birds
promptly
faded
away
again
why
should
new
york
new
jersey
and
massachusetts
exterminate
the
heath
hen
and
coddle
the
pheasant
and
the
hungarian
partridge
the
introduction
of
the
pheasants
interests
me
very
little
every
one
that
i
see
is
a
painful
reminder
of
our
slaughtered
quail
and
grouse
the
birds
that
never
have
had
a
square
deal
from
the
american
people
thus
far
the
introduction
of
the
hungarian
partridge
has
not
been
successful
anywhere
connecticut
missouri
new
jersey
and
i
think
other
states
have
tried
this
and
failed
the
failure
of
that
species
brings
no
sorrow
to
me
i
prefer
our
own
game
birds
and
if
the
american
people
will
not
conserve
those
properly
and
decently
they
deserve
to
have
no
game
birds
the
european
red
deer
in
new
occasionally
a
gameless
land
makes
a
by
introducing
a
foreign
game
animal
that
does
no
harm
and
becomes
of
great
value
the
greatest
success
ever
made
in
the
transplantation
of
game
animals
has
been
in
new
zealand
originally
new
zealand
possessed
no
large
animals
and
no
when
nature
passed
around
the
deer
antelopes
sheep
goats
wild
cattle
and
bears
new
zealand
failed
to
receive
her
share
for
centuries
her
splendid
forests
her
grand
mountains
and
picturesque
valleys
remained
untenanted
by
big
game
in
the
prince
consort
of
england
caused
seven
head
of
european
red
deer
to
be
taken
from
the
royal
park
at
windsor
and
sent
to
christchurch
new
zealand
only
three
of
the
animals
survived
the
long
voyage
a
buck
and
two
does
for
several
weeks
the
two
were
kept
in
a
barn
in
christchurch
where
they
served
no
good
purpose
and
were
not
likely
to
live
long
or
be
happy
finally
some
one
said
let
set
them
free
in
the
mountains
the
idea
was
adopted
the
three
animals
were
hauled
an
uncertain
number
of
miles
into
the
interior
mountains
and
set
free
they
promptly
settled
down
in
their
new
home
they
began
to
breed
and
now
on
the
north
island
there
are
probably
five
thousand
european
red
deer
every
one
of
which
has
descended
directly
from
the
famous
three
and
here
is
the
strangest
part
of
the
story
the
red
deer
of
the
north
island
represent
the
greatest
case
of
breeding
of
wild
animals
on
record
according
to
the
experience
of
the
world
in
the
breeding
of
domestic
cattle
we
should
expect
physical
deterioration
the
development
of
diseases
and
disaster
on
the
contrary
the
usual
evil
results
of
in
domestic
cattle
have
been
totally
absent
red
deer
of
new
zealand
are
physically
larger
and
more
robust
animals
with
longer
and
heavier
antlers
and
longer
hair
than
any
of
the
red
deer
of
europe
west
of
red
deer
have
been
introduced
practically
all
over
new
zealand
and
the
total
number
now
in
the
islands
must
be
somewhere
near
forty
thousand
the
sportsmen
of
that
country
have
grand
sport
and
take
many
splendid
trophies
that
transplantation
has
been
a
very
great
success
incidentally
the
case
of
the
deer
of
the
north
island
taken
along
with
other
cases
of
which
we
know
establishes
a
new
and
important
principle
in
evolution
it
is
this
healthy
wild
animals
are
established
in
a
state
of
nature
either
absolutely
free
or
confined
in
preserves
so
large
that
they
roam
at
will
seek
the
food
of
nature
and
take
care
of
themselves
breeding
produces
no
ill
effects
and
ceases
to
be
a
factor
the
animals
develop
in
physical
perfection
according
to
the
climate
and
their
food
supply
and
the
introduction
of
new
blood
is
not
the
fallow
deer
on
the
island
of
in
the
irish
sea
a
few
miles
from
the
southeast
coast
of
ireland
is
the
island
of
lambay
owned
by
cecil
baring
esq
the
island
is
precisely
one
square
mile
in
area
and
some
of
its
sea
frontage
terminates
in
perpendicular
cliffs
in
many
ways
the
island
is
of
unusual
interest
to
zoologists
and
its
fauna
has
been
well
set
forth
by
baring
in
the
year
three
fallow
deer
a
buck
and
two
does
were
transplanted
from
a
park
on
the
irish
mainland
to
lambay
and
there
set
free
from
that
slender
stock
has
sprung
a
large
herd
which
but
for
the
many
deer
that
have
been
purposely
shot
and
the
really
considerable
number
that
have
been
killed
by
going
over
the
cliffs
in
stormy
weather
the
progeny
of
the
original
three
would
number
several
hundred
head
no
new
blood
has
been
introduced
and
deer
have
died
of
even
counting
out
the
losses
by
the
rifle
and
by
accidental
death
the
herd
numbers
more
than
one
hundred
head
baring
declares
that
neither
he
nor
his
gamekeeper
have
ever
been
able
to
discover
any
deterioration
in
the
deer
of
lambay
either
in
size
weight
size
of
antlers
fertility
or
general
physical
stamina
the
deterioration
through
disease
especially
tuberculosis
that
always
is
dreaded
and
often
observed
in
closely
domestic
cattle
has
been
totally
absent
in
looking
about
for
wild
species
that
have
been
transplanted
and
that
have
thriven
and
become
beneficial
to
man
there
seems
to
be
mighty
little
game
in
sight
the
vast
majority
belong
in
the
next
chapter
we
will
venture
to
mention
the
bob
white
quail
that
were
introduced
into
utah
in
into
idaho
in
and
the
california
valley
quail
in
washington
in
wherever
these
efforts
have
succeeded
the
results
have
been
beneficial
to
man
in
a
effort
was
made
to
introduce
european
quail
into
several
of
the
new
england
and
middle
states
to
take
the
place
of
the
bob
white
we
may
suppose
the
bird
that
ca
stand
the
winters
about
three
thousand
birds
were
distributed
and
set
free
and
went
down
and
out
just
as
might
have
been
expected
during
the
past
twenty
years
it
is
safe
to
say
that
not
less
than
have
been
expended
in
the
northern
states
and
particularly
in
the
northeastern
states
in
importing
live
quail
from
kansas
the
indian
territory
oklahoma
texas
the
carolinas
and
other
southern
states
for
restocking
areas
from
which
the
northern
bob
white
had
been
exterminated
by
foolish
i
think
that
fully
of
these
efforts
have
ended
in
total
failure
the
quail
could
not
survive
in
their
strange
environment
i
can
not
recall
a
in
which
restocking
northern
covers
with
southern
quail
has
been
a
success
there
is
no
royal
road
to
the
restoration
of
an
exterminated
bird
species
where
the
native
seed
still
exists
by
long
labor
and
travail
thorough
protection
and
a
mighty
long
close
season
it
can
be
encouraged
to
back
and
but
it
is
an
evolution
that
can
not
be
hurried
in
the
least
protect
nature
and
leave
the
rest
to
her
with
mammals
the
case
is
different
it
is
possible
to
restock
depleted
areas
provided
time
is
recognized
as
a
dominant
factor
i
can
cite
two
interesting
cases
by
way
of
illustration
but
this
subject
will
form
another
chapter
in
the
transplantation
of
fishes
conditions
are
widely
different
and
many
notable
successes
have
been
achieved
one
of
the
greatest
hits
ever
made
by
the
united
states
bureau
of
fisheries
in
the
planting
of
fish
in
new
localities
was
the
introduction
of
the
striped
bass
or
of
our
atlantic
coast
into
the
coast
waters
of
california
in
live
fish
were
deposited
in
karquines
strait
at
martinez
and
in
more
were
planted
in
suisun
bay
near
the
first
locality
chosen
twelve
years
after
the
first
planting
in
san
francisco
bay
the
markets
of
san
francisco
handled
pounds
of
striped
bass
at
that
time
the
average
weight
for
a
whole
year
was
eleven
pounds
and
the
average
price
was
ten
cents
per
pound
fish
weighing
as
high
as
pounds
have
been
taken
and
there
are
reasons
for
the
belief
that
eventually
the
fish
of
california
will
attain
as
great
weight
as
those
of
the
atlantic
and
the
gulf
the
san
francisco
markets
now
sell
annually
about
one
and
one
half
million
pounds
of
striped
bass
this
fish
has
taken
its
place
among
anglers
as
one
of
the
game
fishes
of
the
california
coast
and
affords
fine
sport
strange
to
say
however
it
has
not
yet
spread
beyond
the
shores
of
california
regarding
this
species
the
records
of
the
united
states
bureau
of
fisheries
are
of
interest
in
the
california
markets
handled
pounds
worth
american
natural
history
nowhere
else
in
the
world
we
venture
to
say
were
such
extensive
costly
and
persistent
efforts
put
forth
in
the
transplantation
of
any
wild
foreign
species
as
the
old
fish
commission
under
spencer
baird
put
forth
in
the
introduction
of
the
german
carp
into
the
fresh
water
ponds
lakes
and
rivers
of
the
united
states
it
was
held
that
because
the
carp
could
live
and
thrive
in
waters
bottomed
with
mud
that
species
would
be
a
boon
to
all
inland
regions
where
bodies
of
water
or
streams
were
scarce
and
dear
although
the
carp
is
not
the
best
fish
in
the
world
for
the
table
it
seemed
that
the
dwellers
in
the
prairie
and
great
plains
regions
would
find
it
far
better
than
bullheads
or
no
fish
at
all
which
are
about
the
same
thing
by
means
of
special
fish
cars
sent
literally
all
over
the
united
states
at
a
great
total
expense
live
carp
hatched
in
the
ponds
near
the
washington
monument
were
distributed
to
all
applicants
the
german
carp
spread
far
and
wide
but
i
think
the
fish
has
about
as
many
enemies
as
friends
in
some
places
strong
objections
have
been
filed
to
the
manner
in
which
carp
stir
up
the
mud
at
the
bottom
of
ponds
and
small
lakes
greatly
to
the
detriment
of
all
the
native
fishes
found
therein
chapter
xxxv
introduced
species
that
have
become
pests
the
man
who
successfully
transplants
or
introduces
into
a
new
habitat
any
persistent
species
of
living
thing
assumes
a
very
grave
responsibility
every
introduced
species
is
doubtful
gravel
until
panned
out
the
enormous
losses
that
have
been
inflicted
upon
the
world
through
the
perpetuation
of
follies
with
wild
vertebrates
and
insects
would
if
added
together
be
enough
to
purchase
a
principality
the
most
aggravating
feature
of
these
follies
in
transplantation
is
that
never
yet
have
they
been
made
severely
punishable
we
are
just
as
careless
and
on
this
point
as
we
were
about
the
government
of
the
yellowstone
park
in
the
days
when
howell
and
other
poachers
destroyed
our
first
national
bison
herd
and
when
caught
as
howell
was
skinning
seven
park
bison
cows
not
be
punished
for
it
because
there
was
no
penalty
prescribed
by
any
there
is
a
way
in
which
any
revengeful
person
could
inflict
enormous
damage
on
the
entire
south
at
no
cost
to
himself
involve
those
states
in
enormous
losses
and
the
expenditure
of
vast
sums
of
money
yet
go
absolutely
unpunished
the
gypsy
moth
is
a
case
in
point
this
winged
calamity
was
imported
at
maiden
massachusetts
near
boston
by
a
french
entomologist
leopold
trouvelot
in
or
history
records
the
fact
that
the
man
of
science
did
not
purposely
set
free
the
pest
he
was
endeavoring
with
live
specimens
to
find
a
moth
that
would
produce
a
cocoon
of
commercial
value
to
america
and
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
blew
out
of
his
study
through
an
open
window
his
living
and
breeding
specimens
of
the
gypsy
moth
the
moth
itself
is
not
bad
to
look
at
but
its
larvae
is
a
great
overgrown
brute
with
an
appetite
like
a
hog
immediately
trouvelot
sought
to
recover
his
specimens
and
when
he
failed
to
find
them
all
like
a
man
of
real
honor
he
notified
the
state
authorities
of
the
accident
every
effort
was
made
to
recover
all
the
specimens
but
enough
escaped
to
produce
progeny
that
soon
became
a
scourge
to
the
trees
of
massachusetts
the
method
of
the
big
caterpillar
was
very
simple
it
devoured
the
entire
foliage
of
every
tree
that
grew
in
its
sphere
of
influence
the
gypsy
moth
spread
with
alarming
rapidity
and
persistence
in
course
of
time
the
state
authorities
of
massachuestts
were
forced
to
begin
a
relentless
war
upon
it
by
poisonous
sprays
and
by
fire
it
was
awful
up
to
this
date
the
new
england
states
and
the
united
states
government
service
have
expended
in
fighting
this
pest
about
the
spread
of
this
pest
has
been
retarded
but
the
gypsy
moth
never
will
be
wholly
stamped
out
it
exists
in
rhode
island
connecticut
and
new
hampshire
and
it
is
due
to
reach
new
york
at
an
early
date
it
is
steadily
spreading
in
three
directions
from
boston
its
original
point
of
departure
and
when
it
strikes
the
state
of
new
york
we
too
will
begin
to
pay
dearly
for
the
trouvclot
experiment
it
is
said
that
general
lawrence
of
medford
massachusetts
has
spent
in
trying
to
protect
his
trees
from
the
ravages
of
this
scourge
the
rabbit
plague
in
australia
and
new
the
rabbit
curse
upon
australia
and
new
zealand
is
so
well
known
as
to
require
little
comment
in
this
case
the
introduction
was
deliberate
in
the
days
when
the
sheep
industry
was
most
prosperous
a
patriotic
gentleman
conceived
the
idea
that
the
introduction
of
the
rabbit
and
its
establishment
as
a
wild
animal
would
be
a
good
thing
he
reasoned
that
it
would
furnish
a
good
food
supply
that
it
would
furnish
sport
and
being
unable
to
harm
any
other
creature
of
flesh
and
blood
it
was
therefore
harmless
accordingly
three
pairs
of
rabbits
were
imported
and
set
free
in
a
short
time
the
immense
number
of
rabbits
that
began
to
overrun
the
country
furnished
food
for
reflection
as
well
as
for
the
table
a
very
simple
calculation
brought
out
the
startling
information
that
under
perfectly
favorable
conditions
a
single
pair
of
rabbits
could
in
three
years
time
produce
progeny
amounting
to
individuals
ever
since
that
time
in
discussing
the
rabbits
of
australia
it
has
been
necessary
to
speak
in
millions
the
inhabitants
of
the
colony
says
richard
lydekker
soon
found
that
the
rabbits
were
a
plague
for
they
devoured
the
grass
which
was
needed
for
the
sheep
the
bark
of
trees
and
every
kind
of
fruit
and
vegetable
until
the
prospects
of
the
colony
became
a
very
serious
matter
and
ruin
seemed
inevitable
in
new
south
wales
upwards
of
rabbits
skins
have
been
exported
in
a
single
year
while
in
thirteen
years
ending
with
no
less
than
were
accounted
for
in
victoria
alone
to
prevent
the
increase
of
these
rodents
the
introduction
of
weasels
stoats
mongooses
has
been
tried
but
it
has
been
found
that
those
carnivores
neglected
the
rabbits
and
took
to
feeding
on

and
thus
became
as
great
a
nuisance
as
the
animals
they
were
intended
to
destroy
the
attempt
to
kill
them
off
by
the
introduction
of
an
epidemic
disease
has
also
failed
in
order
to
protect
such
portions
of
the
country
as
are
still
free
from
rabbits
fences
of
wire
netting
have
been
erected
one
of
these
fences
erected
by
the
government
of
victoria
extending
for
a
distance
of
upwards
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
geographical
miles
in
new
zealand
where
the
rabbit
has
been
introduced
little
more
than
twenty
years
its
increase
has
been
so
enormous
and
the
destruction
it
inflicts
so
great
that
in
some
districts
it
has
actually
been
a
question
whether
the
colonists
should
not
vacate
the
country
rather
than
attempt
to
fight
against
the
plague
the
average
number
of
rabbit
skins
exported
from
new
zealand
is
now
twelve
millions
royal
natural
history
the
fox
pest
in
and
now
unfortunate
australia
has
a
new
pest
also
acquired
by
importation
of
an
alien
species
it
is
the
european
fox
the
only
redeeming
feature
about
this
fresh
calamity
is
found
in
the
fact
that
the
species
was
not
deliberately
introduced
into
australia
for
the
benefit
of
the
local
fauna
rosenhain
of
melbourne
informs
me
that
about
thirty
years
ago
the
hunt
club
brought
to
australia
about
twenty
foxes
for
the
promotion
of
the
noble
sport
of
fox
hunting
in
some
untoward
manner
the
most
of
those
animals
escaped
they
survived
multiplied
and
have
provided
new
south
wales
victoria
and
south
australia
with
a
fox
pest
of
the
first
rank
the
destruction
of
wild
bird
life
and
poultry
has
become
so
serious
that
australia
now
is
making
vigorous
efforts
to
exterminate
the
pest
the
government
pays
ten
shillings
bounty
on
fox
scalps
besides
which
each
prime
fox
skin
is
worth
from
four
to
five
dollars
it
is
hoped
that
these
combined
values
will
eliminate
the
fox
pest
regarding
foxes
in
australia
le
souef
has
this
to
say
in
his
extremely
interesting
and
valuable
book
wild
life
in
australia
page
we
found
that
foxes
were
unfortunately
plentiful
in
this
district
and
in
a
hollow
log
that
served
to
shelter
some
cubs
were
noticed
the
remains
of
ducks
fowls
rabbits
lambs
bandicoots
and
snakes
so
they
evidently
vary
their
fare
snakes
even
not
coming
amiss
they
also
sneak
on
wild
ducks
that
are
nesting
by
the
edge
of
the
water
among
the
rushes
and
tussocky
grass
and
catch
quail
also
especially
sitting
birds
animals
are
and
always
will
be
a
great
source
of
trouble
in
the
thickly
timbered
country
and
stony
ranges
and
will
gradually
like
the
rabbit
extend
all
over
they
are
evidently
not
contented
with
ground
game
only
as
kelly
of
barwonleigh
in
victoria
states
when
riding
past
a
tree
about
feet
high
with
either
a
magpie
or
crow
nest
on
top
i
noticed
the
nest
looked
very
bulky
and
had
something
red
in
it
on
going
nearer
i
saw
a
large
fox
coiled
up
in
it
the
circumstances
alter
cases
and
a
change
of
environment
sometimes
works
marvelous
changes
in
the
character
of
an
animal
species
now
should
not
the
gray
indian
mongoose
formerly
called
the
ichneumon
herpestes
destroy
poultry
in
india
as
it
does
elsewhere
there
is
poultry
in
plenty
to
be
destroyed
but
elects
to
specialize
on
the
killing
of
rats
and
cobras
and
other
snakes
in
his
own
sphere
of
influence
india
and
the
orient
the
mongoose
is
a
fairly
decent
citizen
and
he
fits
into
the
economy
of
that
region
as
a
destroyer
of
the
domestic
rat
he
has
no
equal
in
the
domain
of
flesh
and
blood
his
temper
is
so
fierce
that
one
pet
mongoose
has
been
known
to
kill
a
full
grown
male
giant
bustard
and
put
a
greyhound
to
flight
in
an
evil
moment
espeut
conceived
the
idea
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
introduce
mongooses
to
the
rats
of
barbadoes
and
jamaica
that
were
pestering
the
to
an
annoying
extent
it
was
done
the
mongooses
attacked
the
rats
cleaned
them
out
multiplied
and
then
looked
about
for
more
worlds
to
conquer
snakes
and
lizards
were
few
but
they
cheerfully
killed
and
devoured
all
there
were
then
being
continuously
hungry
they
attacked
the
wild
birds
and
poultry
indiscriminately
and
with
their
usual
vigor
i
have
been
told
that
in
barbadoes
they
cleaned
out
every
living
thing
that
they
could
catch
and
kill
and
then
they
attacked
the
the
last
count
in
the
indictment
may
seem
hard
to
believe
but
it
is
a
fact
that
the
indian
mongoose
often
resorts
to
fruit
and
vegetable
food
in
jamaica
at
the
end
of
the
period
the
planters
joyfully
estimated
that
the
labors
of
herpestes
had
saved
between
pounds
and
pounds
to
the
industries
of
that
island
that
was
before
the
slaughter
of
wild
birds
and
poultry
began
i
am
told
that
up
to
date
the
damage
done
by
the
mongoose
far
exceeds
the
value
of
the
benefit
it
once
conferred
but
the
total
has
not
been
computed
up
to
this
date
the
mongoose
has
invaded
and
become
a
destructive
pest
in
barbadoes
jamaica
cuba
vincent
lucia
trinidad
nevis
fiji
and
all
the
larger
islands
of
the
hawaiian
group
it
would
require
many
pages
to
contain
a
full
account
of
each
introduction
awakening
reckoning
of
damages
and
payment
of
bounties
for
destruction
that
the
fiendish
mongoose
has
wrought
out
wherever
it
has
been
introduced
the
progress
of
the
pest
is
everywhere
the
same
sweeping
destruction
of
rats
snakes
wild
birds
small
mammals
and
finally
poultry
and
vegetables
every
country
that
now
is
without
the
mongoose
will
do
well
to
shut
and
guard
diligently
all
the
doors
by
which
it
might
be
introduced
throughout
its
range
in
the
western
hemisphere
the
mongoose
is
a
pest
and
the
biological
survey
of
the
department
of
agriculture
has
done
well
in
securing
the
enactment
of
a
law
peremptorily
prohibiting
the
importation
of
any
animals
of
that
species
into
the
united
states
or
any
of
its
colonies
the
fierce
temper
indomitable
courage
and
vaulting
appetite
of
the
mongoose
would
make
its
actual
introduction
in
any
of
the
warm
portions
of
the
united
states
a
horrible
calamity
in
the
southern
states
and
all
along
the
pacific
slope
clear
up
to
seattle
it
could
live
thrive
and
multiply
and
the
slaughter
that
it
could
and
would
inflict
upon
our
wild
birds
generally
especially
all
those
that
nest
and
live
on
the
ground
saying
nothing
of
the
slaughter
of
poultry
would
drive
the
american
people
crazy
fancy
an
animal
with
the
murderous
ferocity
of
a
mink
the
agility
of
a
squirrel
the
penetration
of
a
ferret
and
the
cunning
of
a
rat
infesting
the
thickets
and
barnyards
of
this
country
the
mongoose
can
live
wherever
a
rat
can
live
provided
it
can
get
a
fair
amount
of
animal
food
not
for
could
any
one
of
the
southern
or
pacific
states
afford
to
have
a
pair
of
these
little
gray
fiends
imported
and
set
free
if
such
a
calamity
ever
occurs
all
wheels
should
stop
and
every
habitant
should
turn
out
and
hunt
for
the
animals
until
they
are
found
and
pulverized
no
matter
if
it
should
require
a
thousand
men
and
them
if
not
found
the
cost
to
the
state
will
soon
be
a
million
a
year
with
no
ending
in
spite
of
the
vigilance
of
our
custom
house
officers
every
now
and
then
a
hindoo
from
some
foreign
vessel
sneaks
into
the
country
with
a
pet
mongoose
and
they
do
make
great
pets
inside
his
shirt
or
in
the
bottom
of
a
bag
of
clothing
of
course
whenever
the
department
of
agriculture
discovers
any
of
these
surreptitious
animals
they
are
at
once
confiscated
and
either
killed
or
sent
to
a
public
zoological
park

the
director
of
the

is
so
genuinely
concerned
about
the
possibility
of
the
escape
of
a
female
mongoose
that
he
has
issued
two
standing
orders
all
live
mongooses
offered
to
us
shall
at
once
be
purchased
and
every
female
animal
shall
immediately
be

not

the
english
sparrow
is
a
national
sorrow
almost
too
great
to
be
endured
it
is
a
bird
of
plain
plumage
low
tastes
impudent
disposition
and
persistent
fertility
continually
does
it
crowd
out
its
betters
or
pugnaciously
drive
them
away
and
except
on
very
rare
occasions
it
eats
neither
insects
nor
weed
seeds
it
has
no
song
and
in
habits
it
is
a
bird
of
the
street
and
the
gutter
there
is
not
one
good
reason
why
it
should
exist
in
this
country
if
it
were
out
of
the
way
our
native
of
song
and
beauty
could
return
to
our
lawns
and
orchards
the
english
sparrow
is
a
nuisance
and
a
pest
and
if
it
could
be
returned
to
the
land
of
its
nativity
we
would
gain

chapter

national
and
state
game
preserves
and
bird
refuges
out
west
there
is
said
to
be
a
feeling
that
game
and
forest
conservation
has
gone
far
enough
in
montana
particularly
the
national
association
has
for
some
time
been
firmly
convinced
that
the
time
has
come
to
call
a
halt
oh
yes
a
halt
on
the
conservation
of
game
and
forests
but
not
on
the
free
grazing
of
sheep
on
the
public
domain
no
not
even
while
those
same
sheep
are
busily
growing
wool
that
is
so
fearfully
and
wonderfully
conserved
by
a
tariff
that
the
truly
poor
americans
are
forced
to
wear
garments
made
of
shoddy
because
they
can
not
afford
to
buy
clothing
made
of
wool
this
is
the
testimony
of
a
responsible
clothing
merchant
in
we
can
readily
understand
the
new
hue
and
cry
against
conservation
that
the
sheep
men
now
are
raising
of
course
they
are
against
all
new
game
and
forest
reserves
unless
the
woolly
hordes
are
given
the
right
to
graze
in
them
many
men
of
the
great
west
the
west
beyond
the
great
plains
are
afflicted
with
a
desire
to
do
as
they
please
with
the
natural
resources
of
that
region
that
is
the
great
curse
that
rests
upon
our
game
when
the
nearest
game
warden
is
miles
away
and
big
game
is
only
miles
away
it
is
time
for
that
game
to
take
to
the
tall
timber
but
in
the
west
and
east
and
south
there
are
many
men
and
women
who
believe
in
reasonable
conservation
and
deplore
destruction
we
have
not
by
any
means
reached
the
point
where
we
can
think
of
stopping
in
the
making
of
game
preserves
or
forest
preserves
of
the
former
we
have
scarcely
begun
to
make
the
majority
of
the
states
of
our
union
know
of
game
preserves
only
by
hearsay
but
the
time
is
coming
when
the
states
will
come
forward
and
perform
the
serious
duty
that
they
neglect
let
the
statesmen
of
america
be
not
afraid
of
making
too
many
game
preserves
for
the
next
year
one
per
day
would
be
none
too
many
remember
that
on
one
hand
we
have
the
army
of
destruction
and
on
the
other
the
expectant
millions
of
posterity
no
executor
or
trustee
ever
erred
in
safeguarding
an
estate
too
carefully
fifty
years
hence
if
your
successors
and
mine
find
that
too
much
land
has
been
set
aside
for
the
good
of
the
people
they
can
mighty
easily
restore
any
surplus
to
the
public
domain
and
at
a
vastly
increased
valuation
give
posterity
at
least
chance
to
debate
the
question
were
our
forefathers
too
liberal
in
the
making
of
game
and
forest
reserves
we
can
always
carve
up
any
useless
surplus
of
the
public
domain
and
restore
it
to
commercial
uses
but
none
of
the
men
of
will
live
long
enough
to
see
so
strange
a
proceeding
carried
into
effect
the
game
preserves
of
the
united
states
government
are
so
small
with
the
exception
of
the
yellowstone
and
glacier
parks
that
very
few
people
ever
hear
of
them
and
fewer
still
know
of
them
in
detail
it
seems
to
be
quite
time
that
they
should
be
set
forth
categorically
and
it
is
most
earnestly
to
be
hoped
that
this
list
soon
will
be
doubled

along

now
a

officer

the
business
of
protecting
the

is
performed
partly
by
four
scouts
who
are
civilians
specially
engaged
for
that
purpose
but
the
number
has
always
been
totally
inadequate
to

performed

remaining

a
delightful

seemed
to

which
if
true
would
soon
mean
a
decline
the
history
of
the
wild
game
of
the
yellowstone
park
is
blackened
by
two
occurrences
and
one
existing
fact
the
fact
is
the
town
of
gardiner
is
situated
on
the
northern
boundary
of
the
park
in
the
state
of
montana
in
gardiner
there
are
a
number
of
men
armed
with
rifles
who
toward
game
have
the
quality
of
mercy
the
first
stain
is
the
massacre
of
the
wild
bison
for
their
heads
and
robes
already
noted
the
second
blot
is
the
equally
savage
slaughter
in
the
early
winter
of
by
some
of
the
people
of
gardiner
reinforced
by
sportsmen
from
other
parts
of
the
state
of
all
the
park
elk
they
could
kill
bulls
cows
and
calves
because
a
large
band
wandered
across
the
line
into
the
shambles
of
gardiner
on
buffalo
flats
if
the
people
of
gardiner
can
not
refrain
from
slaughtering
the
game
of
the
park
the
very
animals
annually
seen
by
visitors
to
the
park
then
it
is
time
for
the
american
people
to
summon
the
town
of
gardiner
before
the
bar
of
public
opinion
to
show
cause
why
the
town
should
not
be
wiped
off
the
map
the
elk
that
summer
in
the
park
are
compelled
in
winter
to
migrate
to
lower
altitudes
in
order
to
find

is

under

feet
of
snow

the
winter
of
possibly
went

hole
and
went

the
north
of
the

and
the
general
settlement
by
ranchmen
of
jackson
hole
have
deprived
the
elk
herds
of
those
regions
of
their
natural
food
for
several
years
past
up

and
including
the
winter
of

perished

done
all
that

the

manifested
by

has
been
the
exact
reverse
of
that
manifested
in

their
everlasting
credit
they
have
kept

out

responded
in

beyond

terms
of
praise
it
was
magnificent
in
fear
and
trembling
congress
was
asked
through

to
appropriate

and
senator

made
it

for

in

covering
both
sides
of
the
great
continental
divide
there
is
a
region
that
has
been
splendidly
furnished
by
the

of

it
is
a
bewildering
maze
of
thundering

evergreen

its

grizzly

galore
commercially
the
square
miles
of

park
even
with
its
glaciers
and
lakes
are
worth
exactly
the
price
of
its
big
trees
and
not
a

more
for

and
it
is
a
cipher
as
a

be
overbearingly

as

its

is
at

are
filled
and
its

are
encircled
by
grand
forests
of
douglas

keep
out

there
be
no

destroying
the
beauty
of
every
acre
of
forest
that
is
touched
by

or

the
greatest
beauty
of
those

is
the
forest

which
lumbering
operations
would
utterly
never
mind
if
there
is

timber
there
the

is
not

for
the

would
fetch

then
from

we
can
stand
the
expense
if

a

hence
finds
itself
lumberless

then
let
posterity
pay
the
price
and
take
them
we
are
not

for
them

over

in

you
are

at

point
you
are

the
marvelous
panorama
that
unrolls
before
you
from
the
top
of

at

we
saw
a

watched

mt
olympus
national
for
at
least
six
years
the
advocates
of
the
preservation
of
american
wild
life
and
forests
vainly
desired
that
the
grand
mountain
territory
around
mount
olympus
in
northwestern
washington
should
be
established
as
a
national
forest
and
game
preserve
in
addition
to
the
preservation
of
the
forests
it
was
greatly
desired
that
the
remnant
bands
of
olympic
wapiti
described
as
should
be
perpetuated
it
now
contains
specimens
of
that
variety
in
congress
two
determined
efforts
were
made
in
behalf
of
the
region
referred
to
but
both
were
defeated
by
the
enemies
of
forests
and
wild
life
in
an
auspicious
moment
palmer
assistant
chief
of
the
biological
survey
department
of
agriculture
thought
of
a
law
under
which
it
would
be
both
proper
and
right
to
bring
the
desired
preserve
into
existence
the
law
referred
to
expressly
clothes
the
president
of
the
united
states
with
power
to
preserve
any
monumental
feature
of
nature
which
it
clearly
is
the
duty
of
the
state
to
preserve
for
all
time
from
the
hands
of
the
spoilers
with
the
enthusiastic
approval
and
assistance
of
representative
william
humphrey
of
seattle
palmer
set
in
motion
the
machinery
necessary
to
the
carrying
of
the
matter
before
the
president
in
proper
form
and
kept
it
going
with
the
result
that
on
march
president
roosevelt
affixed
his
signature
to
the
document
that
closed
the
circuit
thus
was
created
the
mount
olympus
national
monument
preserving
forever
acres
of
magnificent
mountains
valleys
glaciers
streams
and
forests
and
all
the
wild
creatures
living
therein
and
thereon
the
people
of
the
state
of
washington
have
good
reason
to
rejoice
in
the
fact
that
their
most
scenic
wonderland
and
the
last
survivors
of
the
wapiti
in
that
state
are
now
preserved
for
all
coming
time
at
the
same
time
we
congratulate
palmer
on
the
brilliant
success
of
his
initiative
the
superior
national
game
and
forest
the
people
of
minnesota
long
desired
that
a
certain
great
tract
of
wilderness
in
the
extreme
northern
portion
of
that
state
now
well
stocked
with
moose
and
deer
should
be
established
as
a
game
and
forest
preserve
unfortunately
however
the
national
government
could
go
no
farther
than
to
withdraw
the
lands
and
waters
from
entry
and
declare
it
a
forest
reserve
at
the
right
moment
some
bright
genius
proposed
that
the
national
government
should
by
executive
order
create
a
reserve
and
then
that
the
legislature
of
minnesota
should
pass
an
act
providing
that
every
national
forest
of
that
state
should
also
be
regarded
as
a
game
both
those
things
were
done
almost
as
soon
as
said
carlos
avery
the
executive
agent
of
the
board
of
game
and
fish
commissioners
of
minnesota
is
entitled
to
great
credit
for
the
action
of
his
state
and
we
have
to
thank
gifford
pinchot
and
president
roosevelt
for
the
executive
action
that
represented
the
first
half
of
the
effort
the
new
superior
preserve
is
valuable
as
a
game
and
forest
reserve
and
nothing
else
it
is
a
wilderness
of
small
lakes
marshes
creeks
hummocks
of
land
scrubby
timber
and
practically
nothing
of
commercial
value
but
the
wilderness
contains
many
moose
and
zoologically
it
is
for
all
practical
purposes
a
moose
preserve
in
it
in
avery
saw
moose
in
three
days
fullerton
saw
in
nine
days
and
fullerton
estimated
the
total
number
of
moose
in
minnesota
as
a
whole
at
head
in
area
it
contains
acres
and
the
creation
of
this
great
preserve
was
accomplished
on
april
the
wichita
national
game
in
the
wichita
mountains
of
southwestern
oklahoma
there
is
a
national
game
preserve
containing
acres
on
this
preserve
is
a
fenced
bison
range
and
a
herd
of
american
bison
which
owe
their
existence
to
the
initiative
of
the
new
york
zoological
society
on
march
the
society
proposed
to
the
national
government
the
founding
of
a
range
and
herd
on
a
basis
that
was
entirely
new
to
the
society
it
seemed
desirable
that
for
the
encouragement
of
congress
in
the
preservation
of
species
that
are
threatened
with
extermination
the
scientific
corporations
of
america
and
private
individuals
also
should
do
something
more
than
to
offer
advice
and
exhortations
to
the
government
accordingly
the
zoological
society
offered
to
present
to
the
government
delivered
on
the
ground
in
oklahoma
a
herd
of
fifteen
bison
as
the
nucleus
of
a
new
national
herd
provided
congress
would
furnish
a
satisfactory
fenced
range
and
maintain
the
herd
the
offer
was
at
once
accepted
by
hon
james
wilson
secretary
of
agriculture
and
the
society
was
invited
to
propose
a
site
for
a
range
the
society
sent
a
representative
to
the
wichita
national
forest
reserve
who
recommended
a
range
and
made
a
report
upon
it
which
the
society
adopted
by
act
of
congress
the
range
was
at
once
established
and
fenced
its
area
is
twelve
square
miles
acres
in
october
the
zoological
society
took
from
its
herd
in
the
zoological
park
nine
female
and
six
male
bison
and
delivered
them
at
the
bison
range
there
were
many
predictions
that
all
those
bison
would
die
of
texas
fever
within
one
year
but
the
parties
most
interested
persisted
in
trying
conclusions
with
the
famous
tick
of
texas
frank
rush
was
appointed
warden
of
the
new
national
bison
range
and
his
management
has
been
so
successful
that
only
two
of
the
bison
died
of
the
fever
the
disease
has
been
stamped
out
and
the
herd
now
contains
head
within
five
years
it
should
reach
the
mark
elk
deer
and
antelope
have
been
placed
in
the
range
and
all
save
the
antelope
are
doing
well
the
wichita
bison
range
is
an
unqualified
success
the
montana
national
bison
the
opening
of
the
flathead
indian
reservation
to
settlement
in
afforded
a
golden
opportunity
to
locate
in
that
region
another
national
bison
herd
accordingly
in
the
american
bison
society
formulated
a
plan
by
which
the
establishment
of
such
a
range
and
herd
might
be
brought
about
that
plan
was
successfully
carried
into
effect
in
and
the
bison
society
proposed
to
the
national
government
to
donate
a
herd
of
at
least
bison
provided
congress
would
purchase
a
range
fence
it
and
maintain
the
herd
the
offer
was
immediately
accepted
and
with
commendable
promptness
congress
appropriated
with
which
to
purchase
the
range
and
fence
it
the
bison
society
examined
various
sites
and
finally
recommended
what
was
regarded
as
an
ideal
location
situated
near
ravalli
montana
north
of
the
jocko
river
and
northern
pacific
railway
and
east
of
the
flathead
river
the
nearest
stations
are
ravalli
and
dixon
the
area
of
the
range
is
about
square
miles
acres
and
for
the
purpose
that
it
is
to
serve
it
is
beautiful
and
perfect
beyond
compare
in
it
the
bison
herd
requires
no
winter
feeding
whatever
in
the
bison
society
raised
by
subscription
a
fund
of
and
with
it
purchased
very
perfect
bison
from
the
famous
conrad
herd
at
kalispell
of
which
were
females
one
gift
bison
was
added
by
and
charles
goodnight
two
were
presented
by
the
estate
of
charles
conrad
and
three
were
presented
from
the
famous
corbin
herd
at
newport
by
the
blue
mountain
forest
association
starting
with
that
nucleus
of
head
in
the
herd
has
already
increased
to

the
herd
came
through
the
severe
winter
of
without
having
been
fed
any
hay
whatever
and
the
founders
of
it
confidently
expect
to
live
to
see
it
increase
to
one
thousand

to
an

that

in
the

the
proposition
that
every
state
territory
and
province
in
north
america
and
everywhere
else
should
establish
a
series
of
state
forest
and
game
preserves
is
fairly
incontestable
as
a
business
proposition
it
is
no
more
a
debatable
question
or
open
to
argument
than
is
the
water
supply
or
sewer
system
of
a
city
the
only
perfect
way
to
conserve
a
water
supply
for
a
great
human
population
is
by
acquiring
title
to
water
sheds
and
either
protecting
the
forests
upon
them
or
planting
forests
in
case
none
exist
in
one
important
matter
the
state
of
pennsylvania
has
been
wide
awake
and
in
advance
of
the
times
i
will
cite
her
system
of
forest
reserves
and
game
preserves
as
a
model
plan
for
other
states
to
follow
and
i
sincerely
hope
that
by
the
time
the
members
of
the
present
state
game
commission
have
passed
from
earth
the
people
of
pennsylvania
will
have
learned
the
value
of
the
work
they
are
now
doing
and
at
least
give
them
the
appreciation
that
is
deserved
by
citizens
who
do
large
things
for
the
people
without
hope
of
material
reward
at
this
moment
commissioner
john
phillips
and
joseph
kalbfus
are
putting
their
heart
blood
into
the
business
of
preserving
and
increasing
the
game
and
other
wild
life
of
pennsylvania
and
the
utter
lack
of
appreciation
that
is
now
being
shown
some
is
really
distressing
i
refer
particularly
to
the
utterly
misguided
and
mistaken
body
of
hunters
and
anglers
having
headquarters
at
harrisburg
whose
members
are
grossly
mislead
into
a
wrong
position
by
a
man
who
seeks
to
secure
a
salaried
state
position
through
the
hostile
organization
that
he
has
built
up
apparently
for
his
own
use
in
the
belief
that
those
members
generally
are
mislead
and
not
and
that
the
organization
contains
a
majority
of
conscientious
sportsmen
i
predict
that
ere
long
the
evil
genius
of
pennsylvania
game
protection
will
be
ordered
to
the
rear
while
the
organization
as
a
whole
takes
its
place
on
the
side
of
the
game
commission
where
it
belongs
the
game
sanctuary
scheme
that
pennsylvania
has
developed
is
so
new
that
as
yet
only
a
very
small
fraction
of
the
people
of
that
state
either
understand
it
or
appreciate
its
importance
to
begin
with
pennsylvania
has
acquired
up
to
date
about
one
million
acres
of
forest
lands
scattered
through
of
the
counties
of
the
state
these
great
holdings
are
to
be
gradually
increased
these
wild
lands
including
many
sterile
mountain
farms
of
no
real
value
for
agricultural
purposes
have
been
acquired
first
of
all
for
the
purpose
of
conserving
the
water
supply
of
the
state
and
they
are
called
the
state
forest
reserves
next
in
order
the
state
game
commission
has
created
in
favorable
localities
in
the
forest
reserves
five
great
game
preserves
the
plan
is
decidedly
novel
and
original
but
is
very
simple
withal
in
the
center
of
a
great
tract
of
forest
reserve
a
specially
desirable
tract
has
been
chosen
and
its
boundaries
marked
out
by
the
stringing
of
a
single
heavy
fence
wire
surrounding
the
entire
selection
the
area
within
that
boundary
wire
is
an
absolute
sanctuary
for
all
wild
creatures
save
those
that
prey
upon
game
and
in
it
no
man
may
hunt
anything
nor
fire
a
gun
the
boundary
wire
is
by
no
means
a
fence
for
it
keeps
nothing
out
nor
in
outside
of
the
wire
and
the
sanctuary
men
may
hunt
in
the
open
season
but
at
the
wire
every
chase
must
end
if
the
hunted
deer
knows
enough
to
flee
to
the
sanctuary
when
attacked
so
much
the
better
for
the
deer
the
tide
of
wild
life
ebbs
and
flows
under
the
wire
and
beyond
a
doubt
the
deer
and
grouse
will
quickly
find
that
within
it
lies
absolute
safety
there
the
breeding
and
rearing
of
young
may
go
on
undisturbed
in
view
of
the
fact
that
hunting
may
go
on
in
the
forest
reserve
areas
surrounding
these
sanctuaries
no
intelligent
sportsman
needs
to
be
told
that
in
a
few
years
all
such
regions
will
be
teeming
with
deer
grouse
and
other
game
where
there
is
one
deer
there
will
be
twenty
ten
years
hence
because
the
law
of
pennsylvania
forbids
the
killing
of
does
and
then
there
will
be
twenty
times
the
legitimate
hunting
that
there
is
for
example
the
clinton
county
game
preserve
of
acres
is
surrounded
by
acres
of
forest
reserve
which
form
legitimate
hunting
grounds
for
the
game
bred
in
the
sanctuary
reservoir
in
clearfield
county
the
game
sanctuary
is
surrounded
by
acres
of
forest
reserve
the
preserves
created
in
pennsylvania
up
to
date
are
as
follows
in
clinton
county
acres
in
clearfield
county
acres
in
franklin
county
acres
in
perry
county
acres
in
westmoreland
county
acres
it
is
the
deliberate
intention
of
the
game
commission
to
increase
these
game
preserves
until
there
is
at
least
one
in
each
county
it
is
the
policy
of
the
commission
to
clear
out
of
the
game
sanctuaries
all
the
mammals
and
birds
that
destroy
wild
life
such
as
foxes
mink
weasels
skunks
and
destructive
hawks
and
owls
this
is
accomplished
partly
by
buying
old
horses
killing
them
in
the
preserves
and
poisoning
them
thoroughly
with
strychnine
each
preserve
now
contains
a
nucleus
herd
of
deer
some
of
them
imported
from
northern
michigan
ruffed
grouse
are
breeding
rapidly
and
in
the
clearfield
county
preserve
there
are
said
to
be
at
least
three
thousand
the
game
commission
considers
it
a
patriotic
duty
to
preserve
the
wild
turkey
ruffed
grouse
and
quail
rather
than
have
those
species
replaced
at
great
expense
by
species
imported
from
the
old
world
in
their
work
for
the
protection
preservation
and
increase
of
the
game
of
pennsylvania
partly
for
the
purpose
of
providing
legitimate
hunting
for
the
mechanic
as
well
as
the
millionaire
the
state
game
commissioners
are
putting
a
great
amount
of
thought
and
labor
and
whenever
their
efforts
are
criticized
their
motives
impugned
or
their
honesty
questioned
by
men
who
are
not
worthy
to
unlace
their
shoes
it
makes
me
tired
and
angry

the
adirondack

with
wise
and
commendable
forethought
the
state
of
new
york
has
preserved
in
the
adirondack
wilderness
familiarly
known
as
the
north
woods
a
magnificent
forest
domain
forever
dedicated
to
campers
outdoorsmen
and
hunters
at
present
it
contains
square
miles
acres
of
hills
valleys
and
mountains
adorned
by
countless
lakes
and
streams
by
some
persons
it
has
been
believed
that
in
the
state
forests
the
cutting
and
sale
of
large
trees
would
be
justifiable
business
and
agreeable
to
the
public
but
it
has
been
demonstrated
that
this
is
not
the
case
the
people
of
the
state
firmly
object
to
the
havoc
that
is
wrought
by
logging
operations
in
beautiful
forests
the
state
does
not
yet
need
any
of
the
money
that
could
be
derived
from
such
operations
the
chief
anxiety
of
the
public
is
that
hereafter
forest
fires
shall
be
prevented
no
matter
what
fire
protection
may
cost
the
burning
of
coal
on
any

operated

deeply
eroded

carved
and
highly
picturesque
the
new
state
preserve
contains
square
miles
but
there
is
so
little
grazing
ground
for

and
bison
it
is
absolutely
imperative
that
a
narrow
strip
of
level
grass
land
should
be
added
along
the
southern
border
this
proposed
addition
is
being
fiercely
resisted
by
an
organized
movement
of
the
sheep
owners
of
montana
the
national
wool
growers
association
who
naturally
want
the
public
domain
for

it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
the
sheep
men
south
of
the
preserve
the
only
men
who
really
are
affected
will
be
able
to
thwart
a
movement
that
has
for
its
object
the
development
of
a
very
good

for
the
benefit
of
the
ninety
millions
of

public
the

has
been
so
ruthlessly
swept
away
and
particularly
the
vanishing

once
very
numerous
in

region
in
order
to
relieve
the
sheep
men
of
all
trouble
on
account
of
that

chapter

game
preserves
and
game
laws
in
canada
as
now
set
forth
on
the
map
of
north
america
canada
is
a
vast
country
we
must
no
longer
think
of
ontario
and
quebec
as
canada
west
and
canada
east
because
the
new
owns
and
rules
everything
from
labrador
to
british
columbia
and
all
the
northern
mainland
save
alaska
although
the
fauna
of
canada
is
strictly
boreal
it
is
sufficiently
dispersed
and
diversified
to
demand
wise
legislation
and
plenty
of
it
for
a
nation
with
an
outfit
of
provinces
so
new
canada
already
is
well
advanced
in
the
matter
of
game
laws
and
game
preserves
and
in
some
respects
she
has
set
the
pace
for
her
southern
neighbors
for
example
in
new
brunswick
we
see
the
lordly
moose
successfully
hunted
for
sport
not
only
without
being
exterminated
but
actually
on
a
basis
that
permits
it
to
increase
in
number
in
nova
scotia
we
see
a
law
in
force
successfully
prohibits
the
waste
of
moose
a
loss
that
characterizes
moose
hunting
everywhere
else
throughout
the
range
of
that
animal
all
over
southern
canada
the
use
of
automatic
shotguns
in
hunting
is
strictly
prohibited
on
the
other
hand
the
laws
of
the
canadians
are
weak
in
not
preventing
the
sale
of
all
wild
game
and
the
killing
of
antelope
in
the
matter
of
there
are
far
too
many
open
doors
and
a
sweeping
reform
is
very
necessary
speaking
generally
and
with
application
from
labrador
to
british
columbia
the
american
process
of
game
extermination
according
to
law
is
vigorously
and
successfully
being
pursued
by
the
people
of
canada
the
open
seasons
are
too
long
and
the
bag
limits
are
too
generous
to
the
gunners
as
it
is
elsewhere
the
laws
on
birds
are
a
farce
because
it
is
impossible
to
enforce
them
save
on
every
tenth
man
for
example
in
his
admirable
final
report
of
the
ontario
game
and
fisheries
commission
commissioner
kelly
evans
says
the
prairie
chicken
which
formerly
was
comparatively
plentiful
throughout
the
greater
portion
of
the
rainy
river
district
has
now
become
practically
extinct
in
that
region
various
causes
have
been
assigned
for
this
but
it
would
seem
as
usual
to
have
been
mainly
the
fault
of
indiscriminate

slaughter
page
like
the
united
states
the
various
portions
of
canada
have
their
various
local
troubles
in
protection
i
think
the
greatest
practical
difficulties
and
the
most
real
opposition
to
adequate
measures
is
found
in
the
provinces
of
quebec
and
ontario
is
it
because
the
population
is
impatient
of
real
restraint
and
objects
to
measures
that
are
drastic
even
though
they
are
necessary
in
ontario
commissioner
evans
has
been
splendidly
supported
by
the
government
and
by
all
the
real
sportsmen
of
that
province
but
the
gunners
and
guerrillas
of
destruction
have
successfully
postponed
several
of
the
reforms
that
he
has
advocated
and
which
should
have
been
carried
into
effect
so
far
as
moral
support
for
game
protection
is
concerned
i
think
that
the
prairie
and
mountain
provinces
have
the
best
of
it
in
manitoba
saskatchewan
alberta
athabasca
and
british
columbia
the
spirit
of
the
people
is
mainly
correct
and
the
chief
thing
that
seems
to
be
lacking
is
a
kelly
evans
in
each
of
those
provinces
to
urge
public
sentiment
into
strong
action
for
example
why
should
alberta
still
permit
the
hunting
and
killing
of
antelope
when
it
is
so
well
known
that
that
species
is
vanishing
like
a
mist
before
the
morning
sun
i
think
it
is
because
no
one
seems
to
have
risen
up
as
shields
did
in
the
united
states
to
make
a
big
fuss
about
it
and
demand
a
reform
at
any
rate
all
the
provinces
of
canada
that
still
possess
antelope
should
pass
laws
giving
that
species
absolute
close
seasons
for
ten
why
neglect
it
longer
when
such
neglect
is
now
so
very
wrong
whether
this
is
done
or
not
i
sincerely
hope
that
hereafter
no
true
american
sportsman
will
be
guilty
of
killing
one
of
the
vanishing
antelope
of
canada
even
though
the
law
doth
give
it
the
game
preserves
of
canada
in
the
creation
of
national
parks
and
game
preserves
some
of
the
provinces
of
the
canadian
nation
have
displayed
a
degree
of
foresight
and
enterprise
that
merits
sincere
admiration
while
in
different
provinces
the
exact
status
of
these
establishments
may
vary
somewhat
the
main
purpose
of
each
is
the
same
the
preservation
of
the
forests
and
the
wild
life
in
all
of
them
a
regulated
amount
of
fishing
is
permitted
and
in
some
the
taking
of
animals
is
permitted
but
i
believe
in
all
the
birds
and
furless
mammals
are
strictly
protected
in
some
parks
the
carrying
of
firearms
still
is
permitted
but
that
privilege
is
quite
out
of
harmony
with
the
spirit
and
purposes
of
a
game
preserve
and
should
be
abolished
if
it
is
necessary
to
carry
firearms
through
a
preserve
as
often
happens
in
the
yellowstone
park
it
can
be
done
under
seals
that
are
affixed
by
duly
appointed
officers
and
thus
will
temptation
be
kept
out
of
the
way
of
sinners
up
to
this
date
i
never
have
seen
a
publication
which
set
forth
in
one
place
even
so
much
as
an
annotated
list
of
the
game
preserves
of
the
various
provinces
of
canada
and
at
present
exact
information
regarding
them
is
rather
difficult
to
obtain
it
seems
that
an
adequate
governmental
publication
on
this
subject
is
now
due
and
overdue
at
the
present
time
says
commissioner
evans
in
his
final
report
the
algonquin
national
park
is
the
only
actual
game
preserve
in
the
province
being
in
fact
a
game
reserve
and
not
a
forest
reserve
but
in
the
past
at
least
a
measure
of
protection
would
seem
to
have
been
afforded
the
game
in
most
of
the
forest
reserves
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
carrying
of
firearms
therein
has
been
discouraged
and
it
would
appear
to
require
but
the
passing
of
an
to
render
the
carrying
of
firearms
in
all
reserves
illegal
it
is
sincerely
to
be
hoped
that
not
only
will
such
action
be
taken
without
delay
but
also
that
all
the
forest
reserves
will
be
declared
game
reserves
in
the
strictest
sense
to
this
sentiment
all
friends
of
wild
life
will
join
a
fervent
wish
for
its
realization
as
conditions
are
it
is
to
have
too
many
game
there
is
everything
to
gain
and
nothing
to
lose
by
making
every
national
forest
and
forest
reserve
on
the
whole
continent
of
north
america
a
game
preserve
in
the
strictest
sense
and
we
hope
to
live
to
see
that
end
accomplished
both
in
the
united
states
and
canada

a
pace
that

benefits
to

in

is
nothing

the

two

represented
to

the
great
desirability
of
enlarging
this
preserve
toward
the
north
and
west
the
better
to
protect
the
mountain
sheep
and
other
big
game
of
that
region
the
suggestion
was
received
in
a
friendly
spirit
and
there
is
good
reason
to
hope
that
at
an
early
date
the
enlargement
will
be
made
british
this
province
has
made
an
excellent
beginning
in
the
creation
of
game
preserves
the
first
agitation
on
that
subject
was
begun
in
by
two
sportsmen
whose
names
in
connection
with
it
have
long
since
been
forgotten
on
november
the
legislative
council
of
british
columbia
issued
a
proclamation
that
created
a
very
fine
game
preserve
in
the
east
kootenai
district
between
the
elk
and
bull
rivers
and
northwestward
thereof
to
the
white
river
country
by
an
unfortunate
oversight
the
new
preserve
never
has
been
officially
named
but
we
may
designate
it
here
as
elk
river
game
this
preserve
has
a
total
area
of
about
square
miles
and
includes
a
fine
tract
of
mountains
valleys
lakes
and
streams
it
contained
in
about
mountain
goats
sheep
a
few
elk
and
deer
and
about
grizzly
bears
all
these
have
notably
increased
during
the
period
of
absolute
protection
that
they
have
enjoyed
it
is
probable
that
this
preserve
contains
more
white
mountain
goats
than
any
other
preserve
that
thus
far
has
been
made
it
was
in
this
region
that
john
phillips
and
henry
fairfield
osborne
made
the
first
mountain
goat
photographs
ever
made
at
close
range
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
protection
of
this
preserve
both
as
to
its
wild
life
and
its
timber
will
be
made
perpetual
river
next
after
the
above
there
was
created
in
british
columbia
a
game
preserve
covering
a
large
portion
of
the
mountain
territory
that
rises
between
the
north
and
south
forks
of
the

river
it
is
about
miles
long
by

wide

contains
about
square

a

has
been
established
a

of
about

manitoba

made
an
excellent
beginning

is
good
to

a

strictly
prohibited
within
this

the

regions
of
manitoba
saskatchewan
and
alberta
form
what
is
probably
the
most
important
in
north
america
to
a
great
extent
it
rests
with
those
provinces
to
say
whether
the
central
united
states
shall
have
any
ducks
and
geese
or
not
is
high
time
that
an
international
treaty
should
be
made
between
the
united
states
canada
and
mexico
for
the
federal
protection
of
all
migratory
these
preserves
are
of
course
intended
to
conserve
grouse
and
all
other
birds
as
well
as
big
game

to
the
cooperation
of

worthy
of
the

that
they
are
intended
to

surpassed
only
by

its

the

its

is
in
several
places
only
miles
from
the

while
its
most
northern
angle
is
within
miles
of

john
its
greatest
width
from

is
miles
and
its
greatest
length
from

is
miles
it
covers
a
huge
watershed
in
which
over
a
dozen
large

and
many
small
ones
have
their
sources
it
is
indeed
a

the
rivers
are
well
stocked
with
fish
and
the
big

includes
moose

caribou
black

fox
and
sad
to
say
the

the
caribou
live
in
rather
small

is
permitted

therefore
it
is

named
in
honor
of

been
proposed
by

the
general

chosen
is
the

north
of
ottawa
and
the

within
easy

the
location
recommended
lies
between
the
gatineau

on
the
east
and
wolf

on
the
west
the
proposal
is
meeting
with
much
popular
favor
and
it
is
extremely
probable
that
it
will
be
carried
into
effect
at
an
early
date
during
the
past
two
years
william
wood
has
strongly
advocated
the
making
of
game
preserves
in
labrador
that
will
not
only
tend
to
preserve
the
scanty
fauna
of
that
region
from
extinction
but
will
also
aid
in
bringing
it
back
while
wood
very
energetic
and
praiseworthy
campaign
has
not
yet
been
crowned
with
success
undoubtedly
it
will
be
successful
in
the
near
future
because
ultimately
such
causes
always
win
their
objects
provided
they
are
prosecuted
with
the
firm
and
unflagging
persistence
which
has
characterized
this
particular
campaign
we
congratulate
wood
on
the
success
that
he
in
the
near
future
game
laws
of
the
canadian
provinces
the
worst
feature
of
the
alberta
laws
is
the
annual
open
season
on
antelope
two
of
which
may
be
killed
under
each
license
this
is
and
a
perpetual
close
season
should
at
once
be
enacted
duck
shooting
in
august
is
wrong
and
the
season
should
not
open
until
september
it
is
not
right
that
should
be
made
so
easy
and
so
fearfully
prolonged
that
extermination
is
certain
killing
of
cranes
and
shore
birds
should
be
absolutely
stopped
for
five
no
province
can
afford
the
expense
to
the
wheat
crops
of
the
slaughter
of
shore
birds
of
which
are
great
the
bag
limit
of
two
sheep
is
too
high
by
per
cent
it
should
immediately
be
cut
down
to
one
sheep
before
sheep
hunting
in
alberta
becomes
a
lost
art
hunting
should
not
be
quite
the
reverse
there
are
already
too
many
sportsmen
the
bag
limit
on
grouse
and
ptarmigan
of
per
day
or
in
a
season
is
simply
legalized
slaughter
no
more
and
no
less
and
if
it
is
continued
a
grouseless
province
will
be
the
quick
result
the
birds
are
not
sufficiently
numerous
to
withstand
the
guns
on
that
basis
alberta
should
be
wiser
than
the
states
below
the
international
boundary
that
are
annihilating
their
remnants
of
birds
as
fast
as
they
can
be
found
british
we
note
with
much
satisfaction
that
the
provincial
game
warden
bryan
williams
has
been
allowed
for
the
pay
of
game
wardens
and
for
the
destruction
of
wolves
coyotes
pumas
and
other
animals
during
the
past
two
years
the
following
were
killed
and
bounties
were
paid
upon
them
wolves
coyotes
cougars
horned
owls
golden
eagles
now
says
warden
williams
in
his
excellent
annual
report
for
in
these
two
years
a
total
of
wolves
and
cougars
and
coyotes
were
destroyed
as
well
as
a
number
of
others
poisoned
and
not
recovered
for
the
bounty
allowing
fifty
head
for
each
wolf
and
cougar
and
ten
for
each
coyote
by
their
bounties
alone
head
of
game
and
domestic
animals
were
saved
is
it
any
wonder
that
deer
are
increasing
almost
everywhere
the
great
horned
owl
has
been
and
still
is
a
great
scourge
to
the
upland
game
birds
partly
because
when
game
is
abundant
they
become
fastidious
and
eat
only
the
brains
of
their
prey
the
destruction
of
of
them
on
the
lower
mainland
during
the
last
two
years
has
made
these
owls
sing
very
small
and
says
the
warden
is
it
any
wonder
that
grouse
are
again
increasing
i
have
discussed
with
the
provincial
game
warden
the
advisability
of
putting
a
limit
of
one
on
the
grizzly
bear
but
williams
advances
good
reasons
for
the
opinion
that
it
would
be
impracticable
to
do
so
at
present
i
am
quite
sure
however
that
the
time
has
already
arrived
when
a
limit
of
one
is
necessary
during
the
present
year
three
of
my
friends
who
went
hunting
in
british
columbia
killed
grizzly
bears
hereafter
i
will
locate
no
more
bear
hunters
in
that
country
until
the
bag
limit
is
reduced
to
one
grizzly
per
year
since
the
trapping
of
bears
south
of
the
main
line
of
the
canadian
pacific
railway
has
been
stopped
and
an
excellent
move
too
a
rocky
mountain
without
a
grizzly
bear
is
like
a
rose
the
bag
limit
on
the
big
game
of
british
columbia
is
at
least
twice
too
liberal
five
deer
two
elk
two
moose
one
in
kootenay
county
three
caribou
and
three
goats
there
is
no
necessity
for
such
wasteful
liberality
few
sportsmen
go
to
british
columbia
for
the
sake
of
a
large
lot
of
animals
i
know
many
men
who
have
been
there
to
hunt
and
the
great
majority
cared
more
for
the
scenery
and
the
wild
romance
of
camping
out
in
ground
mountains
than
for
blood
and
trophies
what
are
we
to
think
of
a
bag
limit
of
fifty
ducks
per
day
in
october
and
november
a
limit
indeed
evidently
manitoba
is
tired
of
having
ducks
ruffed
grouse
pinnated
and
other
grouse
pestering
her
farmers
and
laborers
while
assuming
to
fix
bag
limits
that
will
be
of
some
benefit
to
those
species
the
limit
is
distinctly
off
and
nothing
short
of
a
quick
and
drastic
reform
will
save
a
remnant
that
will
remain
visible
to
the
naked
eye
new
this
is
the
banner
province
in
the
protection
of
moose
caribou
and
deer
even
while
permitting
them
to
be
shot
for
sport
of
course
only
males
are
killed
and
i
am
assured
by
competent
judges
that
thus
far
the
killing
of
the
finest
and
largest
male
moose
has
had
no
bad
effect
upon
the
stature
or
antlers
of
the
species
as
a
whole
nova
if
there
is
anything
wrong
with
the
game
laws
of
nova
scotia
it
lies
in
the
sale
of
moose
meat
and
all
kinds
of
feathered
game
during
the
open
season
if
that
province
were
more
heavily
populated
it
would
mean
a
great
destruction
of
game
even
with
conditions
as
they
are
the
sale
permitted
is
entirely
wrong
and
against
the
best
interests
of
per
cent
of
the
people
as
previously
mentioned
the
law
against
the
waste
of
moose
meat
is
both
novel
and
admirable
the
saving
of
any
considerable
portion
of
the
flesh
of
a
bull
moose
along
with
its
head
is
a
large
order
but
it
is
right
the
degree
of
accountability
to
which
guides
are
held
for
the
doings
of
the
men
whom
they
pilot
into
the
woods
is
entirely
commendable
and
worthy
of
imitation
if
a
sportsman
or
gunner
does
the
wrong
thing
the
guide
loses
his
license
this
is
another
of
the
provinces
having
no
real
surplus
of
big
game
with
which
to
sustain
for
any
length
of
time
an
excess
of
generosity
i
am
told
that
in
this
province
there
is
now
a
great
deal
of
open
country
around
each
wild
animal
and
yet
it
cheerfully
offers
two
moose
two
elk
two
caribou
and
two
per
season
to
each
licensed
gunner
or
sportsman
the
limit
is
too
generous
by
half
why
throw
away
an
extra
worth
of
game
with
each
license
that
is
precisely
what
the
people
of
saskatchewan
are
doing
and
that
it
should
be
stopped
at
once
and
for
ten
years
this
province
permits
the
sale
of
all
the
finest
and
best
wild
game
within
its
borders
moose
elk
caribou
sheep
and
goats
the
flesh
of
all
these
may
be
sold
during
the
open
season
and
for
sixty
days
thereafter
of
the
species
named
above
the
barren
ground
caribou
is
the
only
one
regarding
which
we
need
not
worry
because
that
species
still
exists
in
millions
the
osborn
caribou
can
be
exterminated
in
our
own
times
because
it
is
nowhere
really
numerous
and
it
inhabits
exposed
situations
chapter
xxxviii
private
game
preserves
primarily
in
the
early
days
of
the
the
and
predatory
lords
of
creation
evolved
the
private
game
preserve
as
a
scheme
for
preventing
other
fellows
from
shooting
and
for
keeping
the
game
sacred
to
slaughter
by
themselves
the
idea
of
conserving
the
game
was
a
consideration
the
first
being
the
estoppel
of
the
other
man
the
owner
of
a
game
preserve
delights
in
the
annual
killing
of
the
surplus
game
and
we
have
even
heard
it
whispered
that
in
the
dark
ages
there
were
kings
who
enjoyed
the
wholesale
slaughter
of
deer
wild
boar
pheasants
and
grouse
if
we
may
accept
as
true
the
history
of
sport
in
europe
there
have
been
men
who
have
loved
slaughter
with
a
genuine
that
is
quite
foreign
to
the
real
sportsman
in
america
the
impulse
is
different
here
there
is
raging
a
genuine
fever
for
private
game
preserves
some
of
those
already
existing
are
of
fine
proportions
and
cost
fortunes
to
create
every
true
sportsman
who
is
rich
enough
to
own
a
private
game
preserve
sooner
or
later
acquires
one
you
will
find
them
scattered
throughout
the
temperate
zone
of
north
america
from
the
bay
of
fundy
to
san
diego
i
have
had
invitations
to
visit
preserves
in
an
unbroken
chain
from
the
farthest
corner
of
quebec
to
the
pacific
coast
and
from
grand
island
lake
superior
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
it
was
not
necessarily
to
hunt
and
kill
something
but
to
the
game
and
the
beauties
of
nature
the
wealthy
american
and
canadian
joyously
buys
a
tract
of
wilderness
fences
it
stocks
it
with
game
both
great
and
small
and
provides
game
keepers
for
all
the
year
round
at
first
he
has
an
idea
that
he
will
hunt
therein
and
that
his
guests
will
hunt
also
and
actually
kill
game
in
a
mild
way
this
fiction
sometimes
is
maintained
for
years
the
owner
may
each
year
shoot
two
or
three
head
of
his
surplus
big
game
and
his
tenderfoot
guests
who
do
know
what
real
hunting
is
may
also
kill
something
each
year
but
in
most
of
the
american
preserves
with
which
i
am
well
acquainted
the
gentlemanly
sport
of
hunting
big
game
is
almost
a
joke
the
trouble
is
usually
the
owner
becomes
so
attached
to
his
big
game
and
admires
it
so
sincerely
he
has
not
the
heart
to
kill
it
himself
and
he
finds
no
joy
whatever
in
seeing
it
shot
down
by
others
in
this
country
the
slaughter
of
game
for
the
market
is
not
considered
a
gentlemanly
pastime
even
though
there
is
a
surplus
of
game
that
must
be
reduced
to
the
average
american
the
slaughter
of
elk
deer
and
birds
that
have
been
bred
in
a
preserve
does
not
appeal
in
the
least
he
knows
that
in
the
protection
of
a
preserve
the
wild
creatures
lose
much
of
their
fear
of
man
and
become
easy
marks
and
shall
a
real
sportsman
go
out
with
a
gun
and
a
bushel
of
cartridges
on
a
pony
and
without
warning
betray
the
confidence
of
the
wild
in
terms
of
fire
and
blood
others
may
do
it
if
they
like
but
as
a
rule
that
is
not
what
an
american
calls
sport
one
and
grizzly
bear
or
mountain
sheep
outwitted
on
a
is
worth
more
as
a
sporting
proposition
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
deer
carcasses
laid
out
side
by
side
on
a
nice
park
lawn
to
be
photographed
as
one
day
kill
in
america
the
shooting
of
driven
game
is
something
of
which
we
know
little
save
by
hearsay
in
europe
it
is
practiced
on
everything
from
scotch
grouse
to
italian
ibex
the
german
crown
prince
in
his
fascinating
little
volume
from
my
hunting
very
neatly
fixes
the
value
of
such
shooting
as
a
real
sportsman
proposition
in
the
following
sentence
the
shooting
of
driven
game
is
merely
a
question
of
marksmanship
and
is
after
all
more
in
the
nature
of
a
shooting
exercise
than
sport
i
have
seen
some
shooting
in
preserves
that
was
too
tame
to
be
called
sport
but
on
the
other
hand
i
can
testify
that
in
grouse
shooting
as
it
is
done
behind
the
dogs
on
carnegie
moor
at
skibo
it
is
sport
in
which
the
hunter
earns
every
grouse
that
falls
to
his
gun
at
the
same
time
also
i
believe
that
the
shooting
of
madly
running
ibex
as
it
is
done
by
the
king
of
italy
in
his
three
mountain
preserves
is
sufficiently
difficult
to
put
the
best
hunter
to
the
test
there
are
times
when
shooting
driven
game
calls
for
far
more
dexterity
with
the
rifle
than
is
ordinarily
demanded
in
the
in
america
as
in
england
and
on
the
continent
of
europe
private
game
preserves
are
so
numerous
it
is
impossible
to
mention
more
than
a
very
few
of
them
unless
one
devotes
a
volume
to
the
subject
probably
there
are
more
than
five
hundred
and
no
list
of
them
is
up
to
date
for
more
than
one
day
because
the
number
is
constantly
increasing
i
make
no
pretense
even
of
possessing
a
list
of
those
in
america
and
i
mention
only
a
few
of
those
with
which
i
am
best
acquainted
by
way
of
illustration
one
of
the
earliest
and
the
most
celebrated
deer
parks
of
the
united
states
was
that
of
hon
john
dean
caton
of
two
hundred
acres
located
near
ottawa
established
about
it
was
the
experiments
and
observations
made
in
that
park
that
yielded
judge
caton
justly
famous
book
on
the
antelope
and
deer
of
america
the
first
game
preserve
established
by
an
incorporated
club
was
blooming
grove
park
of
one
thousand
acres
in
pennsylvania
where
great
success
has
been
attained
in
the
breeding
and
rearing
of
deer
in
the
eastern
united
states
the
most
game
preserve
is
blue
mountain
forest
park
near
newport
new
hampshire
it
was
founded
in
by
the
late
austin
corbin
and
has
been
loyally
and
diligently
maintained
by
austin
corbin
george
edgell
and
the
other
members
of
the
corbin
family
ownership
is
vested
in
the
blue
mountain
forest
association
the
area
of
the
preserve
is
acres
and
besides
embracing
much
fine
forest
on
croydon
mountain
it
also
contains
many
converted
farms
whose
meadow
lands
afford
good
grazing
this
preserve
contains
a
large
herd
of
bison
head
elk
deer
wild
boar
and
much
smaller
game
the
annual
surplus
of
bison
and
other
large
game
is
regularly
sold
and
distributed
throughout
the
world
for
the
stocking
of
other
parks
and
zoological
gardens
each
year
a
few
surplus
deer
are
quietly
killed
for
the
boston
market
but
a
far
greater
number
are
sold
alive
at
from
to
each
in
carload
lots
in
the
adirondacks
of
northern
new
york
there
are
a
great
many
private
game
preserves
palmer
in
his
pamphlet
on
private
game
preserves
department
of
agriculture
places
the
number
at
and
their
total
area
at
acres
some
of
them
have
caused
much
irritation
among
some
of
the
hunting
fishing
and
trapping
residents
of
the
adirondack
region
they
seem
to
resent
the
idea
of
the
exclusive
ownership
of
lands
that
are
good
this
view
of
property
rights
has
caused
much
trouble
and
some
bloodshed
two
persons
having
been
killed
for
presuming
to
assert
exclusive
rights
in
large
tracts
of
wilderness
property
in
the
upland
preserve
under
private
ownership
says
palmer
may
be
found
one
of
the
most
important
factors
in
the
maintenance
of
the
future
supply
of
game
and
game
birds
nearly
all
such
preserves
are
maintained
for
the
propagation
of
deer
quail
grouse
or
pheasants
they
vary
widely
in
area
character
and
purpose
and
embrace
some
of
the
largest
game
refuges
in
the
country
some
of
the
preserves
in
north
carolina
cover
from
to
acres
several
in
south
carolina
exceed
acres
in
extent
the
megantic
club
northern
preserve
on
the
boundary
between
quebec
and
maine
embraces
nearly
square
miles
or
upward
of
acres
comparatively
few
of
the
larger
preserves
are
enclosed
and
on
such
grounds
hunting
becomes
sport
quite
as
genuine
as
it
is
in
regions
open
to
free
hunting
in
some
instances
part
of
the
tract
is
fenced
while
large
unenclosed
areas
are
protected
by
being
posted
the
character
of
their
tenure
varies
also
some
are
owned
in
fee
simple
others
particularly
the
larger
ones
are
leased
or
else
comprise
merely
the
shooting
rights
on
the
land
in
both
size
and
tenure
the
upland
preserves
of
the
united
states
are
comparable
with
the
grouse
moors
and
large
deer
forests
of
scotland
of
the
game
preserves
in
the
south
i
know
one
that
is
quite
ideal
it
is
vincent
island
near
apalachicola
florida
in
the
northern
edge
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
it
was
purchased
in
by
ray
pierce
and
his
guests
kill
perhaps
one
hundred
ducks
each
year
out
of
the
thousands
that
flock
to
the
ten
big
ponds
that
occupy
the
eastern
third
of
the
island
into
those
ponds
much
good
duck
food
has
been
introduced
and
the
area
of
the
island
is
twenty
square
miles
besides
being
a
great
winter
resort
for
ducks
its
sandy
ridges
and
jungles
of
palms
to
and
live
oak
afford
fine
haunts
and
feeding
grounds
for
deer
those
jungles
contain
two
species
of
deer
and
and
pierce
has
introduced
the
indian
sambar
deer
and
japanese
sika
deer
cervus
both
of
which
are
doing
well
we
are
watching
the
progress
of
those
big
sambar
deer
with
very
keen
interest
and
it
is
to
be
recorded
that
already
that
species
has
crossed
with
the
louisiana
deer
illustration
map
of
marsh
island
and
adjacent
preserves
during
the
autumn
of
public
attention
in
the
united
states
was
for
a
time
focused
on
the
purchase
of
marsh
island
louisiana
by
russell
sage
and
its
permanent
dedication
to
the
cause
of
protection
this
delightful
event
has
brought
into
notice
the
louisiana
state
game
preserve
of
acres
near
marsh
island
and
its
hinterland
and
water
of
acres
adjoining
which
constitutes
the
wild
fowl
preserve
these
three
great
preserves
taken
together
as
they
lie
form
a
sanctuary
of
great
size
and
of
great
value
to
the
whole
mississippi
valley
now
that
all
therein
has
been
stopped
it
is
safe
to
predict
that
they
shortly
will
be
inhabited
by
a
population
that
will
really
stagger
the
imagination
preserves
a
ducking
preserve
is
a
large
tract
of
land
and
water
owned
by
a
few
individuals
or
a
club
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
exclusively
for
themselves
and
their
friends
the
best
possible
opportunities
for
killing
large
numbers
of
ducks
and
geese
without
interference
in
no
sense
whatever
are
they
intended
to
preserve
or
increase
the
supply
of
wild
fowl
the
real
object
of
their
existence
is
duck
and
goose
slaughter
for
example
the
worst
story
on
record
comes
to
us
from
the
grounds
of
the
glenn
county
club
in
california
whereon
as
stated
elsewhere
two
men
armed
with
automatic
shotguns
killed
geese
in
one
hour
and
bagged
a
total
of
in
one
day
i
shall
not
attempt
to
give
any
list
of
the
ducking
preserves
the
word
preserve
when
applied
to
them
is
a
misnomer
thirteen
states
have
these
incorporated
for
ducks
and
geese
the
greatest
number
being
in
california
illinois
north
carolina
and
virginia
california
has
carried
the
idea
to
the
limit
where
it
is
claimed
that
it
constitutes
an
abuse
palmer
says
that
one
or
two
of
the
club
preserves
on
the
western
side
of
the
san
joaquin
valley
contain
upward
of
square
miles
or
acres
with
considerable
asperity
it
is
now
publicly
charged
in
the
columns
of
of
san
francisco
that
for
the
unattached
sportsmen
there
is
no
longer
any
to
be
had
in
california
because
all
the
good
are
owned
and
exclusively
controlled
by
clubs
in
many
states
the
private
game
preserves
are
a
source
of
great
irritation
and
many
have
been
attacked
in

british
game
preserves
in
africa
and
australia
this
brief
chapter
is
offered
as
an
to
the
world
at
large
in
the
early
days
of
america
the
founders
of
our
states
and
territories
gave
little
heed
or
none
at
all
to
the
preservation
of
wild
life
even
if
they
thought
of
that
duty
undoubtedly
they
felt
that
the
game
would
always
last
and
that
they
had
no
time
for
such
sentimental
side
issues
as
the
making
of
game
preserves
they
were
coping
with
troubles
and
perplexities
of
many
kinds
and
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
up
to
forty
years
ago
real
game
protection
in
america
went
chiefly
by
default
in
south
africa
precisely
the
same
conditions
have
prevailed
until
recent
times
the
early
colonists
were
kept
so
busy
shooting
lions
and
making
farms
that
not
one
game
preserve
was
made
if
any
men
can
be
excused
from
the
work
and
worry
of
preserving
game
and
making
preserves
it
is
those
who
spend
their
lives
pioneering
and
in
countries
like
africa
men
who
continually
have
to
contend
with
disease
bad
food
rains
insect
pests
dangerous
wild
beasts
and
native
cussedness
may
well
claim
that
they
have
troubles
enough
without
going
far
into
campaigns
to
preserve
wild
animals
in
countries
where
animals
are
plentiful
and
cheap
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
people
of
alaska
can
not
be
relied
upon
to
preserve
the
alaskan
game
they
are
busy
with
other
things
that
are
of
more
importance
to
them

representatives
of
the
great
powers
owning
territory
in
africa
held
a
conference
in
the
interests
of
the
life
of
that
continent
as
a
result
a
convention
was
signed
by
which
those
powers
bound
themselves
to
make
provision
for
the
prevention
of
further
undue
destruction
of
wild
game
the
principles
laid
down
for
universal
observance
were
as
follows
sparing
of
females
and
immature
animals
the
establishment
of
close
seasons
and
game
sanctuaries
absolute
protection
of
rare
species
restrictions
on
export
for
trading
purposes
of
skins
horns
tusks
etc
prohibition
of
the
use
of
pits
snares
and
game
traps
the
brave
and
hardy
men
who
are
making
for
the
british
people
a
grand
empire
in
africa
probably
are
greater
men
than
people
realize
to
them
the
white
man
burden
of
game
preservation
is
accepted
as
all
in
the

a
mere
handful
of
british
civil
officers
strongly
aided
by
the
society
for
the
preservation
of
the
fauna
of
the
british
empire
have
carved
out
and
set
aside
a
great
chain
of
game
preserves
reaching
all
the
way
from
swaziland
and
the
transvaal
to
khartoum
taken
either
collectively
or
separately
it
represents
grand
work
characteristic
of
the
greatest

those

are
worthy

in
the
foundation
of
what
one
day
will
be

great
british

in

the

of
the

particularly
commend
this

as
a
showing
of
the

of

who
have
not
waited
until
the

had
been
before
creating

in
which
to
preserve

in
view
of
these
results
how
trivial
and
small
of
soul
seems

mercenary
efforts
of
the
organized
of

plan
to

rugged
and
arid

creek
antelope
preserve
that
is
intended
to
help
save
a
valuable
species
from

extermination
at
this
point
i
must
quote
the
views
of
a
high
authority
on
the
status
of
wild
life
and
game
preserves
in
africa
the
following
is
from
major
book
it
is
a
remarkable
phenomenon
in
human
affairs
how
seldom
the
experience
of
others
seems
to
turn
the
scale
of
action
there
are
i
take
it
very
few
farmers
in
the
cape
colony
the
orange
free
state
or
the
transvaal
who
would
not
be
glad
to
see
an
adequate
supply
of
game
upon
their
land
indeed
the
writer
is
constantly
dealing
with
applications
as
to
the
possibility
of
reintroducing
various
species
from
the
game
reserves
to
private
farms
and
only
the
question
of
expense
and
the
difficulty
of
transport
have
up
to
the
present
prevented
this
being
done
on
a
considerable
scale
when
therefore
the
relatively
small
populations
of
such
protectorates
as
are
still
well
stocked
with
game
are
heard
airily
discussing
the
advisability
of
getting
rid
of
it
as
quickly
as
possible
one
realizes
how
often
vain
are
the
teachings
of
history
and
how
hopeless
it
is
to
quote
the
result
of
similar
action
elsewhere
it
remains
only
to
trust
that
things
may
be
seen
in
truer
perspective
ere
it
is
too
late
and
that
those
in
whose
temporary
charge
it
is
may
not
cast
recklessly
away
one
of
nature
most
splendid
assets

moreover
which
once
lightly

any
possibility
be
regained

definite
bounds

as

this
is
a
very
different
thing
from
wholesale
destruction

may

breeding
game
and
fur
in
captivity
game
the
breeding
of
game
in
captivity
for
sale
in
the
markets
of
the
world
is
just
as
legitimate
as
the
breeding
of
domestic
species
this
applies
equally
to
mammals
birds
reptiles
and
fishes
it
is
the
duty
of
the
nation
and
the
state
to
foster
such
industries
and
facilitate
the
marketing
of
their
products
without
any
unnecessary
formalities
delays
or
losses
to
producers
or
to
purchasers
already
this
principle
has
been
established
in
several
states
without
going
into
the
records
it
is
safe
to
say
that
colorado
was
the
pioneer
in
the
movement
about
but
there
is
one
person
who
would
like
to
have
the
world
believe
that
it
started
in
the
state
of
new
york
about
the
idea
is
not
quite
as
old
as
the
hills
but
the
application
of
it
in
the
united
states
dates
back
through
a
considerable
vista
of
years
the
laws
of
colorado
providing
for
the
creation
of
private
game
preserves
and
the
marketing
of
their
product
under
a
tagging
system
are
very
elaborate
and
they
show
a
sincere
desire
to
foster
an
industry
as
yet
but
slightly
developed
in
this
country
the
laws
of
new
york
are
much
more
simple
and
easy
to
understand
than
those
of
colorado
there
is
one
important
principle
now
fully
recognized
in
the
new
york
laws
for
game
breeding
that
other
states
will
do
well
to
adopt
it
is
the
fact
that
certain
kinds
of
wild
game
not
be
bred
and
reared
in
captivity
on
a
commercial
and
this
being
true
it
is
clearly
against
public
policy
to
provide
for
the
sale
of
any
such
species
why
provide
for
the
sale
of
grouse
and
ducks
which
we
know
can
not
be
bred
and
reared
in
confinement
in
marketable
numbers
for
example
if
we
may
judge
by
the
numerous
experiments
that
have
been
made
as
we
certainly
have
a
right
to
do
no
man
can
successfully
breed
and
rear
in
captivity
on
a
commercial
basis
the
canvasback
duck
teal
pintail
duck
ruffed
grouse
or
quail
this
being
the
case
no
amount
of
clamor
from
game
dealers
and
their
allies
ever
should
induce
any
state
legislature
to
provide
for
the
sale
of
any
of
those
species
it
has
been
fully
that
they
and
bred
in
captivity
in
large
numbers
the
moment
the
markets
of
a
state
are
thrown
open
to
these
impossible
species
from
that
moment
the
state
game
wardens
must
make
a
continuous
struggle
to
prevent
the
importation
and
sale
of
those
birds
contrary
to
law
this
proposition
is
so
simple
that
every
honest
man
can
see
it
all
that
any
state
legislature
may
rightfully
be
asked
to
do
is
to
provide
for
the
sale

authors
considered
with
the
utmost
care
the
possibilities
in
the
breeding
of
game
in
the
united

on
a
commercial

it
was
found
that
as
yet
only
two
wild
native
species
have
been
and
can
be
reared
in
captivity
on
a
large
scale
these
are
the

of
foreign
species
we
can
breed
successfully
for

the

the

that
the
best

of

could
devise

is
expeditious
cheap

effective
practically
the
only
real
concession
that
is
required

the
killing
which
must
be
done
in
a
systematic
way
whereby
a
state

can
visit
the

premises
and
affix
the

without
any
serious
sacrifice
of
time
or
convenience
on

the

cost
the

five
cents

they
pay
the
cost
of

rendered

admirable

which
is
very
plainly
set

now
is
it
not
the
duty
of
connecticut
maryland
virginia
the
carolinas
and
every
other

to
return
our
compliment
by

up

expectations
at

of

after
the
passage
of
our

in
california
will
try
to
secure
a
similar
act
and
we
know
full
well
that
her
ducks
geese
quail
grouse
and
pigeon
need
it
very
much
if
the
california
protectors
of
wild
life
succeed
in
arousing
the
great
quiet
mass
of
people
in
that
state
their
bayne
bill
will
be
swept
through
their
legislature
on
a
tidal
wave
of
popular
sentiment
for
people
who
own
wild
woodlands
near
large
cities
there
are
good
profits
to
be
made
in
rearing
deer
for
the
market
i
would
also
mention
elk
but
for
the
fact
that
every
man
who
rears
a
fine
herd
of
elk
quickly
becomes
so
proud
of
the
animals
and
so
much
attached
to
them
that
he
can
not
bear
to
have
them
shot
and
butchered
for
market
elk
are
just
as
easy
to
breed
and
rear
as
domestic
cattle
except
that
in
the
fall
breeding
season
the
fighting
of
rival
bulls
demands
careful
and
intelligent
management
concerning
the
possibilities
of
feeding
elk
on
hay
at
per
ton
and
declaring
an
annual
profit
i
am
not
informed
if
the
elk
require
to
be
fed
all
the
year
round
the
high
price
of
hay
and
grain
might
easily
render
it
impossible
to
produce
marketable
animals
at
a
profit
any
one
who
owns
from
one
hundred
to
one
thousand
acres
of
wild
brushy
or
land
can
raise
or
virginia
deer
at
a
profit
with
smaller
areas
of
land
free
range
becomes
impossible
and
the
prospects
of
commercial
profits
diminish
and
disappear
in
any
event
a
fenced
range
is
absolutely
essential
and
the
best
fence
is
the

high
all
horizontals
of
no

top

wires
of

the

this

elk

the

is
hardy
and
prolific
and
when
fairly
cooked
its
flesh
is
a
great
delicacy
in

the
department
of
agriculture
has
published
for
free
distribution
a
pamphlet
entitled
raising
deer
and
other
large
game
animals
in
the
united
states
by
david
lantz
which
contains
much
valuable
information
although
it
leaves
much
unsaid
all
breeders
of
deer
are
cautioned
that
during
the
fall
and
early
winter
months
all
adult
bucks
are
dangerous
to
man
and
should
be
treated
accordingly
a
measure
of
safety
can
be
secured
in
a
large
park
by
compelling
the
deer
always
to
keep
at
a
respectful
distance
and
making
no
pets
whatever
whenever
a
buck
finds
his
horns
and
loses
his
fear
of
man
climb
the
fence
quickly
bucks
in
the
rutting
season
sometimes
seem
to
go
crazy
and
often
they
attack
men
wantonly
and
dangerously
the
method
of
attack
is
to
an
unarmed
man
almost
irresistible
the
animal
lowers
his
head
stiffens
his
neck
and
with
terrible
force
drives
straight
forward
for
your
stomach
and
bowels
usually
there
are
eight
sharp
spears
of
bone
to
impale
you
the
best
defense
of
an
unarmed
man
is
to
seize
the
left
antler
with
the
left
hand
and
with
the
right
hand
pull
the
deer
right
front
foot
from
under
him
merely
holding
to
the
horns
makes
great
sport
for
the
deer
he
loves
that
unequal
combat
the
great
desideratum
is
to
put
his
fore
legs
out
of
commission
and
get
him
down
on
his
knees
does
are
sometimes
dangerous
and
inflict
serious
damage
by
rising
on
their
hind
feet
and
viciously
striking
with
their
sharp
front
hoofs
these
tendencies
in
american
deer
are
mentioned
here
as
a
duty
to
persons
who
may
desire
to
breed
deer
for
profit
red

of
anyone
who
has
plenty
of
natural
forest
food
for
deer
and
a
good
market
within
fair
range
may
find
the
european
red
deer
a
desirable
species
it
is
of
size
smaller
and
more
easily
managed
than
the
wapiti
and
is
more
easily
marketed
because
of
its
smaller
size
as
a
species
it
is
hardy
and
prolific
and
of
course
its
venison
is
as
good
as
that
of
any
other

live

this
species
is
the
most
universal
park
deer
of
europe
it
seems
to
be
invulnerable
to
neglect
and
misuse
for
it
has
persisted
through
countless
generations
of
breeding
in
captivity
and
the
abuse
of
all
nations
in
size
it
is
a
trifle
smaller
than
our
deer
with
spots
in
summer
and
horns
that
are
widely
flattened
at
the
extremities
in
a
very
interesting
way
it
is
very
hardy
and
prolific
but
of
course
it
can
not
stand
everything
that
could
be
put
upon
it
it
needs
a
dry
shed
in

red
clover
hay
and
crushed

proposition
it

meaty

can
be
of
this
great
hulking
animated
while
i
have
not
delved
deeply
into
the
subject
of
weight
and
growth
i
feel
sure
from
casual
observations
of
the
growth
of
about
animals
that
this
species
produces
more
venison
during
the
first
two
years
of
its
life
than
any
other
deer
with
which
i
am
acquainted
i
regard
it
as
the
greatest
of
the
whole
deer
family
and
i
know
that
is
a
large
order
the
size
of
a
yearling
is
almost
absurd
it
is
so
great
for
an
animal
of
tender
years
when
adult
the
species
is
for
its
height
very
large
and
heavy
as
a
animal
located
in
the
southern
hill
forests
and
taking
care
of
itself
there
millions
in
it
but
must
be
kept
under
for
in
no
southern
or
northern
state
would
any
such
mass
of
juicy
wild
meat
long
be
permitted
to
roam
at
large
unkilled
through
this
species
i
believe
that
a
million
acres
of
southern
timber
lands
now
useless
except
for
timber
growth
could
be
made
very
productive
in
choice
venison
the
price
would
be
a
good
fence
and
protection
from
poachers
the
indian
sambar
deer
looks
like
a
understudy
of
our
american
elk
it
breeds
well
in
captivity
and
it
is
of
quiet
and
tractable
disposition
it
can
not
live
in
a
country
where
the
temperature
goes
down
to
degrees
and
there
for
long
it
would
i
am
firmly
convinced
do
well
all
along
the
gulf
coast
and
if
acclimatized
along
the
gulf
with
the
lapse
of
time
and
generations
it
would
become
more
and
more
hardy
grow
more
hair
and
push
its
way
northward
until
it
reached
the
latitude
of
tennessee
but
then
in
a
wild
state
it
could
not
be
protected
from
poachers
as
stated
elsewhere
ray
pierce
has
successfully
acclimatized
and
bred
this
species
in
his
vincent
island
game
preserve
near
apalachicola
florida
more
than
that
the
species
has
crossed
with
the

of

living

of
the
indian
sambar
deer
are
worth
from
to
according
to

and
other
conditions
just
at
present
it
seems
difficult
for
americans
to
procure
a
sufficient
number
of
we
have
had
very
bad
luck
with
several
males
that
we
attempted
to
import
for
breeding
purposes
mallard
a
great
many
persons
have
made
persistent
attempts
to
breed
the
canvasback
redhead
mallard
black
duck
pintail
teal
and
other
species
on
a
commercial
basis
so
far
as
i
am
aware
the
mallard
is
the
only
wild
duck
that
has
been
bred
in
sufficient
numbers
to
slaughter
for
the
markets
the
wood
duck
and
mandarin
can
be
bred
in
fair
numbers
but
only
sufficient
to
supply
the
demand
for
birds
for
park
purposes
one
would
naturally
suppose
that
a
species
as
closely
allied
to
the
mallard
as
the
black
duck
known
to
be
would
breed
like
the
mallard
but
the
black
duck
is
so
timid
and
nervous
about
nesting
as
to
be
almost
worthless
in
captivity
all
the
species
named
above
except
the
mallard
must
at
present
and
in
general
be
regarded
as
failures
in
breeding
for
the
market
of
all
american
ducks
the
common
mallard
is
the
most
persistent
and
successful
breeder
it
quickly
becomes
accustomed
to
captivity
it
enjoys
park
life
and
when
given
even
half
a
chance
it
will
breed
and
rear
its
young
unquestionably
the
mallard
duck
can
be
reared
in
captivity
in
numbers
limited
only
by
the
extent
of
breeder
facilities
the
amount
of
net
profit
that
can
be
realized
depends
wholly
upon
the
business
acumen
and
judgment
displayed
in
the
management
of
the
flock
the
total
amount
of
knowledge
necessary
to
success
is
not
so
very
great
but
at
the
same
time
the
exercise
of
a
fair
amount
of
intelligence
and
also
careful
diligence
is
absolutely
necessary
naturally
the
care
and
food
of
the
flock
must
not
cost
extravagantly
or
the
profits
will
inevitably
disappear
as
a
contribution
to
the
cause
of
for
the
market
and
the
creation
of
a
new
industry
of
value

however
it
must
be

in
mind
that
just
now
in

history
is
being
made
more
rapidly
than

i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
the
above
are
the
only
sources
of
information
on
for
profit
but
they
are
the
ones
that
have
most
impressed
me
the
files
of
all
the
journals
and
magazines
for
sportsmen
contain
numerous
articles
on
this
subject
and
they
should
be
carefully
consulted
the
ridiculous
prices
now
being
paid
in
london
for
the
skins
of
black
or
silver
foxes
has
created
in
this
country
a
small
furore
over
the
breeding
of
that
of
the
red
fox
the
prices
that
actually
have
been
obtained
both
for
skins
and
for
live
animals
for
breeding
purposes
have
a
strong
tendency
to
make
people
crazy
fancy
paying
in
real
money
for
one
pair
of
live
black
foxes
that
has
been
done
on
prince
edward
island
and
per
pair
is
now
regarded
as
a
figure

going

years

one

has
made
a
fortune
in
the
business
and
it
is
rumored
that
a
stock
company
is
considering
the
purchase
of
his
fox
ranch
at
a
fabulous
figure
the
enormous
prices
obtainable
for
live
black
foxes
male
or
female
make
diamonds
and
rubies
seem
cheap
and
commonplace
and
it
is
no
wonder
that
enterprising
men
are
tempted
to
enter
that
industry
the
price
of
a
black
fox
is
one
of
the
wonders
of
a
recklessly
extravagant
and
whimsical
age
all
the
world
knows
very
well
that
fox
fur
is
one
of
the
poorest
of
furs
to
withstand
the
wear
and
tear
of
actual
use
about
two
seasons
hard
wear
are
enough
to
put
the
best
fox
skin
on
the
wane
and
three
or
four
can
be
guaranteed
to
throw
it
into
the
discard
even
the
finest
black
fox
skin
is
nothing
superlatively
beautiful
a
choice
cross
fox
skin
costing
only
far
more
beautiful
as
a
color
but
london
joyously
pays
or
for
a
single
skin
to
wear
of
course
all
such
fads
as
this
are
as
ephemeral
as
the
butterflies
of
summer
the
war
quickly
reduced
the
value
of
alaskan
blue
foxes
from
to
and
away
went
the
alaskan
fox
farms
a
similar
twist
of
fortune
fickle
wheel
may
in
any
year
send
the
black
fox
out
of
royal
favor
and
remove
the
bottom
from
the
business
of
producing
it
let
us
hope
however
that
the
craze
for
that
fur
will
continue
for
we
like
to
see
our
friends
and
neighbors
make
good
profits
pheasant
this
subject
is
so
well
understood
by
and
there
is
already
so
much
good
literature
available
regarding
it
it
is
not
necessary
that
i
should
take
it
up
here
chapter

teaching
wild
life
protection
to
the
young
thousands
of
busy
and
burdened
men
and
women
are
striving
hard
early
and
late
to
promote
measures
that
will
preserve
the
valuable
wild
life
of
the
world
they
desire
to
leave
to
the
boys
and
girls
of
tomorrow
a
good
showing
of
the
marvelous
bird
and
animal
forms
that
make
the
world
beautiful
and
interesting
they
are
acting
on
the
principle
that
the
wild
life
of
is
not
ours
to
destroy
or
to
keep
as
we
choose
but
has
been
given
to
us
partly
for
our
benefit
and
partly
for
those
who
come
after
us
and
audit
our
accounts
they
believe
that
we
have
no
right
to
squander
and
destroy
a
heritage
of
priceless
value
which
we
have
done
nothing
to
create
and
which
is
not
ours
to
destroy
duty
of
this
being
the
case
it
is
very
necessary
that
the
young
people
of
should
be
taught
early
and
often
the
virtue
and
the
necessity
of
protection
there
is
no
reason
that
the
boy
of
should
not
take
up
his
share
of
the
common
burden
just
as
soon
as
he
is
old
enough
to
wander
alone
through
the
woods
let
him
be
taught
in
precise
terms
that
he
must
rob
birds
and
that
he
not
shoot
woodpeckers
and
with
a
rifle
or
any
other
gun
at
this
moment
there
lies
upon
my
side
table
a
vicious
little
rifle
that
was
taken
from
two
boys
who
were
camping
in
the
woods
of
connecticut
and
amusing
themselves
by
shooting
valuable
insectivorous
birds
now
those
boys
were
not
wholly
to
blame
for
what
they
were
doing
but
their
fathers
and
mothers
were
much
to
they
should
have
been
taught
at
the
parental
knee
that
it
is
very
wrong
to
kill
any
bird
except
a
genuine
game
bird
and
then
only
in
the
lawful
open
season
those
two
fathers
paid
each
for
having
failed
in
their
duty
and
it
served
them
right
for
they
were
the
real
culprits
rifles
are
becoming
alarmingly
common
in
the
hands
of
boys
must
do
their
duty
in
the
training
of
their
boys
against
it
is
a
very
serious
matter
a
million
boys
who
roam
the
fields
with
small
rifles
without
having
been
instructed
in
protection
can
destroy
an
appalling
number
of
valuable
birds
in
the
course
of
a
year
some
parents
are
so
slavishly
devoted
to
their
children
that
they
wish
them
to
do
everything
they
please
and
be
checked
in
nothing
such
parents
constitute
one
of
the
pests
of
society
and
a
drag
upon
the
happiness
of
their
own
children
it
is
now
the
bounden
duty
of
each
parent
to
teach
each
one
of
his
or
her
children
that
the
time
has
come
when
the
resources
of
nature
and
especially
wild
life
must
be
conserved
to
permit
boys
to
grow
up
and
acquire
guns
without
this
knowledge
is
very
wrong
the
duty
of
teachers
and
a
great
deal
of
nature
study
is
being
taught
in
the
public
schools
of
the
united
states
that
the
young
people
of
our
land
should
be
taught
to
appreciate
the
works
of
nature
and
especially
animal
life
and
plant
life
is
very
desirable
thus
far
however
there
is
a
screw
loose
in
the
system
and
that
is
the
shortage
in
definite
positive
instruction
regarding
toward
the
wild
creatures
great
and
small
along
with
their
nature
studies
all
our
school
children
should
be
taught
in
the
imperative
mood
that
it
is
wrong
to
disturb
breeding
birds
or
rob
birds
nests
that
it
is
wrong
to
destroy
any
harmless
living
creature
not
properly
classed
as
game
except
it
be
to
preserve
it
in
a
museum
that
it
is
no
longer
right
for
civilized
man
to
look
upon
wild
game
as
food
because
there
is
plenty
of
other
food
and
the
remnant
of
game
can
not
withstand
slaughter
in
that
basis
that
the
time
has
come
when
it
is
the
duty
of
every
good
citizen
to
take
an
active
aggressive
part
in
the
destruction
of
wild
life
and
in
its
preservation
that
every
boy
and
girl
over
twelve
years
of
age
can
do
in
this
cause
and
finally
that
protection
and
encouragement
will
bring
back
the
almost
vanished
birds
we
call
upon
all
boards
of
education
all
principals
of
schools
and
all
teachers
to
educate
our
boys
and
girls
constantly
and
imperatively
along
those
lines
teachers
do
not
say
to
your
pupils
it
is
right
and
nice
to
protect
birds
but
say
it
is
your
to
protect
all
harmless
wild
things
and
must
do
in
a
good
cause
there
is
great
virtue
in
must
really
we
are
losing
each
year
an
immense
amount
of
available
protection
the
doctrine
of
imperative
individual
duty
never
yet
has
been
taught
in
our
schools
as
it
should
be
taught
a
few
teachers
have
indeed
covered
this
ground
but
i
am
convinced
that
their
proportion
is
mighty
small
text
the
writers
of
the
nature
study
text
books
are
very
much
to
blame
because
of
the
time
this
subject
has
been
ignored
the
situation
has
not
been
taken
seriously
save
in
a
few
cases
by
a
very
few
authors
i
am
glad
to
report
that
in
there
was
published
a
fine
text
book
by
professor
james
peabody
of
the
morris
high
school
new
york
and
arthur
hunt
in
which
from
beginning
to
end
the
duty
to
protect
wild
life
is
strongly
insisted
upon
it
is
entitled
elementary
biology
plants
animals
and
man
hereafter
no
zoological
or
nature
study
text
book
should
be
given
a
place
in
any
school
in
america
unless
the
author
of
it
has
done
his
full
share
in
setting
forth
the
duty
of
the
young
citizen
toward
wild
life
were
i
a
member
of
a
board
of
education
i
would
seek
to
establish
and
enforce
this
requirement
any
author
who
will
presume
to
write
a
text
book
of
nature
study
or
zoology
without
knowing
and
doing
his
duty
toward
our
vanishing
fauna
is
too
ignorant
of
wild
life
and
too
careless
of
his
duty
toward
it
to
be
accepted
as
a
safe
guide
for
the
young
the
time
for
criminal
indifference
has
gone
by
hereafter
every
one
who
is
not
for
the
preservation
of
wild
life
is
against
it
and
it
is
time
to
separate
the
sheep
from
the
goats
from
this
time
forth
the
preservation
of
our
fauna
should
be
regarded
as
a
subject
on
which
every
candidate
for
a
teacher
certificate
should
undergo
an
examination
before
receiving
authority
to
teach
in
a
public
school
the
candidate
should
be
required
to
know
the
preservation
of
birds
is
necessary
why
the
slaughter
of
wild
life
is
wrong
and
criminal
the
extent
to
which
wild
birds
and
mammals
return
to
us
and
thrive
under
protection
why
wild
game
is
no
longer
a
legitimate
food
supply
why
wild
game
should
not
be
sold
and
why
the
feathers
of
wild
birds
other
than
game
birds
never
should
be
used
as
millinery
ornaments
as
sensible
americans
and
somewhat
boastful
of
our
intelligence
we
should
put
the
education
of
the
young
in
protection
on
a
rational
business
basis
state
in
several
of
our
states
systematic
efforts
to
educate
children
in
their
duty
toward
wild
life
are
already
being
made
to
this
end
an
annual
bird
day
has
been
established
for
observance
this
splendid
idea
is
now
legally
in
force
in
the
following
states
california
connecticut
delaware
illinois
louisiana
minnesota
ohio
and
wisconsin
bird
day
is
also
more
or
less
regularly
observed
though
not
legally
provided
for
in
new
york
indiana
colorado
and
alabama
and
locally
in
some
cities
of
pennsylvania
usually
the
observance
of
the
day
is
combined
with
that
of
arbor
day
and
the
date
is
fixed
by
proclamation
of
the
governor
alabama
and
wisconsin
regularly
issue
elaborate
and
beautiful

and
illinois
and
possibly
other
states
have
issued
very
good
publications
of
this
character
the
phillips
educational
campaign
for
the
quite
recently
there
has
come
under
my
notice
an
episode
in
the
education
of
school
children
that
has
given
the
public
profound
satisfaction
i
cite
it
here
as
an

across
the
monongahela

from
the
city
of

lives
john
phillips

commissioner
sportsman
and
friend
of

is
a
man
who
does
things
and
gets
results

its
existence
to
him

his
initiative
and
labor
it
would
not
have
been
established
it
was
the
first
game
preserve
of
british
columbia
three
years
ago
phillips
became
deeply
impressed
by
the
idea
that
one
of
the
best
ways
in
the
world
to
protect
the
wild
life
both
of
and
the
future
would
be
in
teaching
school
children
to
love
it
and
protect
it
his
fertile
brain
and
open
soon
devised
a
method
for
his
home
city
his
theory
was
that
by
giving
the
children
to
not
only
in
protecting
but
in
actually
the
birds
much
might
be
accomplished
illustration
bird
day
at
carrick
pa
marching
behind
the
governor
in
studying
the
subject
of
bringing
back
the
birds
he
found
that
the
russian
mulberry
is
one
of
the
finest
trees
in
the
world
as
a
purveyor
of
good
fruit
for
many
kinds
of
birds
the
tree
does
not
much
resemble
our
native
mulberry
but
is
equally
beautiful
and
interesting
the
fruit
is
not
a
long
berry
nor
is
it
of
a
purple
color
but
it
grows
from
buds
on
the
limbs
and
twigs
something
after
the
manner
of
the
it
is
smaller
of
light
color
and
has
a
very
distinct
flavor
the
most
striking
peculiarity
about
the
fruit
is
that
it
keeps
on
ripening
during
two
months
or
more
new
berries
appearing
daily
while
others
are
ripening
this
is
why
it
is
such
good
bird
food
nor
is
it
half
bad
for
folks
for
the
berries
are
good
to
look
at
and
to
eat
either
with
cream
or
without
and
to
make
pies
that
will
set
any
sane
boy
mouth
at
sight
erasmus
wilson
everyone
knows
the
value
of
sweet
cherries
both
to
birds
and
to
children
phillips
decided
that
he
would
give
away
several
hundred
bird
boxes
and
also
several
hundred
sweet
cherry
and
russian
mulberry
trees
the
first
gift
distribution
was
made
in
the
early
spring
of
another
followed
in
but
the
last
one
was
the
most
notable
on
april
carrick
had
a
great
and
glorious
bird
day
phillips
was
the
author
of
it
and
governor
tener
the
finisher
on
that
day
occurred
the
third
annual
gift
distribution
of
raw
materials
designed
to
promote
in
the
breasts
of
children
a
love
for
birds
and
an
active
desire
to
protect
and
increase
them
phillips
gave
away
bird
boxes
sweet
cherry
trees
and
mulberry
trees
the
sun
shone
brightly
flags
waved
in
carrick
the
governor
made
one
of
the
best
speeches
of
his
life
and
erasmus
wilson
faithful
friend
of
the
birds
wrote
this
good
story
of
the
occasion
for
the
of
pittsburgh
the
governor
was
there
and
the
children
the
and
the
young
trees
and
was
there
ever
a
brighter
or
more
fitting
day
for
a
children
and
bird
jubilee
the
scene
was
so
inspiring
that
gov
tener
made
one
of
the
best
speeches
of
his
life
the
distribution
of
several
hundred
cherry
and
mulberry
trees
was
the
occasion
and
the
beautiful
grounds
of
the
roosevelt
school
carrick
was
the
scene
john
phillips
sane
sportsman
and
enthusiastic
friend
of
the
birds
has
been
looking
forward
to
this
as
the
culmination
of
a
scheme
he
has
been
working
on
for
years
and
he
was
more
than
pleased
with
the
outcome
the
intense
delight
it
afforded
him
more
than
repaid
him
for
all
it
has
cost
in
all
the
years
past
but
it
was
impossible
to
tell
who
were
the
more
delighted
he
or
the
governor
or
the
children
or
the
visitors
who
were
so
fortunate
as
to
be
present
county
superintendent
of
schools
samuel
hamilton
was
simply
a
mass
of
delight
and
how
could
he
be
otherwise
surrounded
as
he
was
by
and
more
children
fairly
quivering
with
delight
children
will
care
for
and
defend
things
that
are
their
very
own
fight
for
them
and
stand
guard
over
them
realizing
this
phillips
undertook
to
show
them
how
they
could
have
birds
all
their
own
being
clever
in
devising
schemes
for
achieving
things
most
to
be
desired
he
began
giving
out
to
those
who
would
agree
to
put
them
up
and
to
watch
and
defend
the
birds
when
they
came
to
make
their
homes
with
them
and
he
found
that
no
more
faithful
sentinel
ever
stood
on
guard
than
the
boy
who
had
a
all
his
own
here
was
the
solution
to
the
vexed
problem
provide
boxes
for
those
who
would
agree
to
put
them
up
care
for
the
birds
and
study
their
habits
and
needs
the
children
agreed
at
once
and
the
birds
did
not
object
so
phillips
had
some
hundreds
four
or
five
and
wren
boxes
constructed
during
the
past
winter
these
were
passed
out
some
weeks
ago
to
any
boys
or
girls
who
would
present
an
order
signed
by
their
parents
and
countersigned
by
the
principal
of
the
school
he
knows
enough
about
a
boy
to
know
that
he
does
not
prize
the
things
that
come
without
effort
nor
will
he
become
deeply
interested
in
anything
for
which
he
is
not
held
more
or
less
responsible
hence
the
advantage
in
having
him
write
an
order
have
it
indorsed
by
his
parents
and
vouched
for
by
his
school
principal
that
he
had
struck
the
right
scheme
was
proven
by
the
avidity
with
which
the
girls
and
boys
rushed
for
the
boxes
the
fact
that
a
heavy
rain
was
falling
did
not
dampen
their
ardor
for
a
moment
nor
did
the
fact
that
they
were
tramping
phillips
beautiful
lawn
into
a
field
of
mud
phillips
seeing
the
necessity
of
providing
food
for
the
prospective
hosts
of
birds
and
wishing
to
place
the
responsibility
on
the
boys
and
girls
offered
to
provide
a
cherry
tree
or
mulberry
tree
for
every
box
erected
provided
they
should
be
properly
planted
and
diligently
cared
for
this
was
practically
the
culmination
of
the
most
unique
bird
scheme
ever
attempted
and
yesterday
was
the
day
set
apart
for
the
distribution
of
these
hundreds
of
fruit
trees
the
products
of
which
are
to
be
divided
share
and
share
alike
with
the
birds
nowhere
else
has
such
a
scheme
been
attempted
and
never
before
has
there
been
just
such
a
day
of
jubilee
the
intense
interest
manifested
by
the
children
and
the
earnest
enthusiasm
manifested
leaves
no
doubt
about
their
carrying
out
their
part
of
the
contract
illustration
distributing
bird
boxes
and
fruit
trees
up
to
date
phillips
has
given
away
about
bird
boxes
cherry
and
russian
mulberry
trees
and
transformed
the
schools
of
carrick
into
seething
masses
of
children
militantly
enthusiastic
in
the
protection
of
birds
and
in
providing
them
with
homes

a
final
coup
phillips
has
induced
the
city
of

to
create

salary
of

of

from
all
kinds
of

the
ethics
of
sportsmanship
i
count
it
as
rather
strange
that
american
and
english
sportsmen
have
hunted
and
shot
for
a
century
and

formulated
practically
nothing
to
establish
and
define
the
ethics
of
shooting
game
here
and
there
a
few
unwritten
principles
have
been
evolved
and
have
become
fixed
by
common
consent
but
the
total
number
of
these
is
very
few
perhaps
this
has
been
for
the
reason
that
every
free
and
independent
sportsman
prefers
to
be
a
law
unto
himself
is
it
not
doubly
strange
however
that
even
down
to
the
present
year
the
term
sportsmen
never
has
been
defined
by
a
sportsman
forty
years
ago
a
sportsman
might
have
been
defined
according
to
the
standards
of
that
period
as
a
man
who
hunts
wild
game
for
pleasure
those
were
the
days
wherein
no
one
foresaw
the
wholesale
annihilation
of
species
and
there
were
no
wilderness
game
preserves
in
those
days
gentlemen
shot
female
hoofed
game
trapped
bears
if
they
felt
like
it
killed
ten
times
as
much
big
game
as
they
could
use
and
no
one
made
any
fuss
whatever
about
the
waste
or
extermination
of
wild
life
those
were
the
days
of
and
we
are
living
in
a
totally
different
world
a
world
of
grinding
crunching
pulverizing
progress
a
world
of
annihilation
of
the
works
of
nature
and
what
is
a
sportsman
a
sportsman
is
a
man
who
loves
nature
and
who
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
outdoor
life
and
exploration
takes
a
reasonable
toll
of
nature
wild
animals
but
not
for
commercial
profit
and
only
so
long
as
his
hunting
does
not
promote
the
extermination
of
species
in
view
of
the
disappearance
of
wild
life
all
over
the
habitable
globe
and
the
steady
extermination
of
species
the
ethics
of
sportsmanship
has
become
a
matter
of
tremendous
importance
if
a
man
can
shoot
the
last
living
burchell
zebra
or
antelope
and
be
a
sportsman
and
a
gentleman
then
we
may
just
as
well
drop
down
all
bars
and
say
no
more
about
the
ethics
of
shooting
game
but
the
real
of
the
world
are
not
insensible
to
the
duties
of
the
hour
in
regard
to
the
taking
or
not
taking
of
game
the
time
has
come
when
canon
laws
should
be
laid
down
of
application
and
so
thoroughly
accepted
and
promulgated
that
their
binding
force
can
not
be
ignored
among
other
things
it
is
time
for
a
list
of
species
to
be
published
which
no
man
claiming
to
be
either
a
gentleman
or
a
sportsman
can
shoot
for
aught
else
than
preservation
in
a
public
museum
of
course
this
list
would
be
composed
of
the
species
that
are
threatened
with
extermination
of
american
animals
it
should
include
the
antelope
mexican
mountain
sheep
all
the
mountain
sheep
and
goats
in
the
united
states
the
california
grizzly
bear
mule
deer
west
indian
seal
and
california
elephant
seal
and
walrus
in
africa
that
list
should
include
the
eland
white
rhinoceros
blessbok
bontebok
kudu
giraffes
and
southern
elephants
sable
antelope
rhinoceros
south
of
the
zambesi
leucoryx
antelope
and
stork
in
asia
it
should
include
the
great
indian
rhinoceros
and
its
allied
species
the
burrhel
the
nilgiri
tahr
and
the
gayal
the
david
deer
of
manchuria
already
is
extinct
in
a
wild
state
in
australia
the
interdiction
should
include
the
thylacine
or
tasmanian
wolf
all
the
large
kangaroos
the
emu
lyre
bird
and
the
think
what
it
would
mean
to
the
species
named
above
if
all
the
sportsmen
of
the
world
would
unite
in
their
defense
both
actively
and
passively
it
would
be
to
those
species
a
modus
vivendi
worth
while
prior
to
no
effort
so
far
as
we
are
aware
ever
had
been
made
to
promote
the
establishment
of
a
comprehensive
and
code
of
ethics
for
sportsmen
who
shoot
a
few
clubs
of
men
who
are
hunters
of
big
game
had
expressed
in
their
constitutions
a
few
brief
principles
for
the
purpose
of
standardizing
their
own
respective
memberships
but
that
was
all
i
have
not
taken
pains
to
make
a
general
canvass
of
clubs
to
ascertain
what
rules
have
been
laid
down
by
any
large
number
of
organizations
the
boone
and
crockett
club
of
new
york
and
washington

in
its

the

excellent
article

the

has
in
its
constitution
as

the

comprehensive
principle
the
term
sport

not
only
the
observance
of
local
laws
but
excludes
all
methods
of
taking
game
other
than
by
fair
stalking
or
still
hunting
at
the
end
of
the
constitution
of
this
club
is
this
declaration
and
admonition
and
sale
of
as
the
purchase
of
heads

establishes
a
market

and
encourages
indians

to

often
in

always
to
the
detriment
of

terms
to
maintain
the
standard
of
sportsmanship
it
is
not
squandered
bullets
and
swollen
bags
which
appeal
to
us
the
test
is
rather
in
a
love
of

in
acquired
knowledge
of
the
habits
of
animals
in
the
strenuous

as
we
please
the
original
stock
is
given
to
us
for
the
benefit
both
of
the
present
and
the
future
we
must
render
an
accounting
of
this
trust
to
those
who
come
after
us
judging
from
the
rate
at
which
the
wild
creatures
of
north
america
are
now
being
destroyed
fifty
years
hence
there
will
be
no
large
game
left
in
the
united
states
nor
in
canada
outside
of
rigidly
protected
game
preserves
it
is
therefore
the
duty
of
every
good
citizen
to
promote
the
protection
of
forests
and
wild
life
and
the
creation
of
game
preserves
while
a
supply
of
game
remains
every
man
who
finds
pleasure
in
hunting
or
fishing
should
be
willing
to
spend
both
time
and
money
in
active
work
for
the
protection
of
forests
fish
and
game
the
sale
of
game
is
incompatible
with
the
perpetual
preservation
of
a
proper
stock
of
game
therefore
it
should
be
prohibited
by
laws
and
by
public
sentiment
in
the
settled
and
civilized
regions
of
north
america
there
is
no
real
for
the
consumption
of
wild
game
as
human
food
nor
is
there
any
good
excuse
for
the
sale
of
game
for
food
purposes
the
maintenance
of
hired
laborers
on
wild
game
should
be
prohibited
everywhere
under
severe
penalties
an
indian
has
no
more
right
to
kill
wild
game
or
to
subsist
upon
it
all
the
year
round
than
any
white
man
in
the
same
locality
the
indian
has
no
inherent
or
ownership
of
the
game
of
north
america
anymore
than
of
its
mineral
resources
and
he
should
be
governed
by
the
same
game
laws
as
white
men
no
man
can
be
a
good
citizen
and
also
be
a
slaughterer
of
game
or
fishes
beyond
the
narrow
limits
compatible
with
sportsmanship
a
or
a
is
an
undesirable
citizen
and
should
be
treated
as
such
the
highest
purpose
which
the
killing
of
wild
game
and
game
fishes
can
hereafter
be
made
to
serve
is
in
furnishing
objects
to
overworked
men
for
tramping
and
camping
trips
in
the
wilds
and
the
value
of
wild
game
as
human
food
should
no
longer
be
regarded
as
an
important
factor
in
its
pursuit
if
rightly
conserved
wild
game
constitutes
a
valuable
asset
to
any
country
which
possesses
it
and
it
is
good
statesmanship
to
protect
it
an
ideal
hunting
trip
consists
of
a
good
comrade
fine
country
and
a
trophies
per
hunter
in
an
ideal
hunting
trip
the
death
of
the
game
is
only
an
incident
and
by
no
means
is
it
really
necessary
to
a
successful
outing
the
best
hunter
is
the
man
who
finds
the
most
game
kills
the
least
and
leaves
behind
him
no
wounded
animals
the
killing
of
an
animal
means
the
end
of
its
most
interesting
period
when
the
country
is
fine
pursuit
is
more
interesting
than
possession
the
killing
of
a
female
hoofed
animal
save
for
special
preservation
is
to
be
regarded
as
incompatible
with
the
highest
sportsmanship
and
it
should
everywhere
be
prohibited
by
stringent
laws
a
particularly
fine
photograph
of
a
large
wild
animal
in
its
haunts
is
entitled
to
more
credit
than
the
dead
trophy
of
a
similar
animal
an
animal
that
has
been
photographed
never
should
be
killed
unless
previously
wounded

i
am
profoundly
impressed
by
the
fact
that
it
is
high
time
for
sportsmen
all
over
the
world
to
take
to
heart
the
vital
necessity

the
duty

to

the
publication
of
this
chapter
will
hardly
be
regarded
as
a
bid
for
fame
or
even
popularity
on
the
part
of
the
author
however
the
subject
can
not
be
ignored
simply
because
it
is
disagreeable
throughout
sixty
years
to
go
no
further
back
the
people
of
america
have
been
witnessing
the
strange
spectacle
of
american
zoologists
as
a
mass
so
intent
upon
the
academic
study
of
our
continental
fauna
that
they
seem
not
to
have
cared
a
continental
about
the
destruction
of
that
fauna
during
that
tragic
period
twelve
species
of
north
american
birds
have
been
totally
exterminated
are
almost
exterminated
and
the
mammals
have
fared
very
badly
if
by
their
works
ye
shall
know
them
then
no
man
can
say
that
the
men
referred
to
have
been
conspicuous
on
the
firing
line
in
defense
of
assaulted
wild
life
in
their
hearts
we
know
that
in
an
academic
way
the
naturalists
of
america
do
care
about
slaughter
and
the
extermination
of
species
and
we
also
know
that
perhaps
fifty
american
zoologists
have
at
times
taken
an
active
and
serious
interest
in
protection
work
i
am
speaking
now
of
the
general
body
of
museum
directors
and
curators
professors
and
teachers
of
zoology
in
our
institutions
of
learning
a
legion
in
themselves
teachers
of
nature
study
in
our
secondary
schools
investigators
and
specialists
in
state
and
government
service
the
taxidermists
and
osteologists
and
the
array
of
literary
people
who
like
all
the
foregoing
their
bread
and
butter
out
of
the
exploitation
of
wild
taken
as
a
whole
the
people
named
above
constitute
a
grand
army
of
at
least
five
thousand
trained
educated
resourceful
and
influential
persons
they
all
upon
wild
life
for
their
when
they
talk
about
living
things
the
public
listens
with
respectful
attention
their
knowledge
of
the
value
of
wild
life
would
be
worth
something
to
our
cause
but
thus
far
it
never
has
been
capitalized
these
people
are
hard
workers
and
when
they
mark
out
definite
courses
and
attainable
goals
they
know
how
to
get
results
yet
what
do
we
see
for
sixty
long
years
with
the
exception
of
the
work
of
a
guard
of
their
number
this
grand
army
has
remained
in
camp
partly
neglecting
and
partly
refusing
to
move
upon
the
works
of
the
enemy
for
sixty
years
with
the
exception
of
the
law
as
a
class
and
a
mass
they
have
left
to
the
sportsmen
of
the
country
the
dictating
of
laws
for
the
protection
of
all
the
game
birds
the
mammals
and
the
game
fishes
when
we
stop
to
consider
that
the
game
birds
alone
embrace
very
important
the
appalling
extent
to
which
the
zoologist
has
abdicated
in
favor
of
the
sportsman
becomes
apparent
it
is
a
very
great
mistake
and
a
wrong
besides
for
the
zoologists
of
the
country
to
abandon
the
game
birds
mammals
and
fishes
of
north
america
to
the
sportsmen
to
do
with
as
they
please
yet
that
is
practically
what
has
been
done
the
time
was
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
when
wild
life
was
so
abundant
that
we
did
not
need
to
worry
about
its
preservation
that
was
the
golden
era
of
study
and
investigation
that
era
ended
definitely
in
with
the
practical
extermination
of
the
wild
american
bison
partly
through
the
shameful
greed
and
partly
through
the
neglect
of
the
american
people
we
are
now
living
the
middle
of
the
period
of
extermination
the
questions
for
every
american
zoologist
and
every
sportsman
to
answer
now
are
shall
the
slaughter
of
species
go
on
to
a
quick
end
of
the
period
shall
we
give
posterity
a
birdless
gameless
fishless
continent
or
not
shall
we
have
close
seasons
all
over
the
country
for
five
or
ten
years
or
for
five
hundred
years
if
we
are
courageous
we
will
brace
up
and
answer
these
questions
now
like
men
if
we
are
and
eager
for
peace
at
any
price
then
we
will
sidestep
the
ugly
situation
until
the
destroyers
have
settled
it
for
us
by
the
wholesale
extermination
of
species
if
the
zoologist
cares
to
know
then
i
will
tell
him
that
the
wild
life
of
the
world
be
saved
by
law
but
by
sentiment
alone
you
can
not
educate
a
poacher
a
a
a
milliner
or
a
vain
and
foolish
woman
of
fashion
all
these
must
be
curbed
and
controlled
game
refuges
alone
will
not
save
the
wild
life
species
of
birds
mammals
and
game
fishes
of
north
america
must
have
more
thorough
and
protection
than
they
now
have
do
not
always
take
your
cue

along
with

the
members

aroused
such
a
tidal
wave
of
public
sentiment
against
the
sale
of
game
that
the
bayne
bill
was
finally
swept
through
the
legislature
with
only
one
dissenting
vote
and
yet
in
the
beginning
not
one

dared
to
hope
that
that
very
revolutionary
measure
could
by

possibility
be
passed
in
its
first
year

even
if
it
ever
could

was
the
aroused
public
that
did
it
this
volume
has
been
written
under
great
pressure
in
order
to
put
the
whole
situation
before
the
people
of
america
including
the
zoologists
and
to
give
them
some
definite
information
state

state
regarding
the
needs
of

look
at
the
needs
of
your

of

and
you
will
find
work
for
your
hand
to
do
clear
your
conscience
by
taking
hold
now
to
do
everything
that
you
can
to
stop
the
carnage
and
preserve
the
remnant
or
fifty
years
hence
if
we
have
a
birdless
and
gameless
continent
let
it
not
be
said
that
the
zoologists
of
america
helped
to
bring
it
about
by
wicked
apathy
at
this
juncture
a
brief
survey
of
the
attitude
toward
wild
life
of
certain
american
institutions
of
national
reputation
will
be
decidedly
pertinent
i
shall
mention
only
a
few
of
the
many
that
through
their
character
and
position
owe
specific
duties
to
this
cause
the
biological
survey
of
the
department
of
agriculture
is
a
splendid
center
of
activity
and
initiative
in
the
preservation
of
our
wild
life
the
work
of
palmer
has
already
been
spoken
of
and
thanks
to
his
efforts
and
direction
the
survey
has
become
the
recognized
special
champion
of
preservation
in
america
the
forestry
bureau
is
developing
into
a
very
valuable
ally
and
we
confidently
look
forward
to
the
time
when
its
influence
in
preservation
will
be
a
hundred
times
more
potent
than
it
is
will
be
when
every
national
forest
is
made
a
game
preserve
and
every
forest
ranger
is
made
a
game
let
us
have
both
those
developments
and
quickly
in
the
american
museum
of
natural
history
became
a
center
of
activity
in
bird
protection
and
the
headquarters
of
the
new
york
state
audubon
society
the
president
of
the
museum
professor
henry
fairfield
osborn
is
also
the
president
of
that
organization
in
several
of
the
new
york
state
movements
for
bird
conservation
especially
those
bearing
on
the
plumage
law
the
american
museum
has
been
active
and
at
times
conspicuous
no
one
so
i
believe
ever
appealed
to
the
president
of
the
museum
for
help
on
the
firing
line
without
receiving
help
of
some
kind
unfortunately
however
the
preservation
of
wild
life
is
not
one
of
the
declared
objects
of
the
american
museum
corporation
or
one
on
which
its
officers
may
spend
money
as
is
so
freely
and
even
joyously
done
by
the
zoological
society
the
museum
influence
has
been
exerted
chiefly
through
the
active
workers
of
the
state
audubon
society
and
it
was
as
president
of
that
body
that
professor
osborn
subscribed
to
the
fund
that
was
so
largely
instrumental
in
creating
the
new
york
law
against
the
sale
of
game
there
is
room
for
an
important
improvement
in
the
declared
objects
of
the
american
museum
to
the
cause
of
protection
it
is
a
distinct
loss
that
that
great
and
powerful
institution
should
be
unable
to
spend
any
money
in
promoting
the
preservation
of
our
fauna
from
annihilation
an
amendment
to
its
constitution
is
earnestly
recommended
the
activities
of
the
new
york
zoological
society
began
in
and
they
do
not
require
comment
here
they
have
been
continuous
aggressive
and
and
they
have
been
supported
by
thousands
of
dollars
from
the
society
treasury
it
is
true
that
the
funds
available
for
protection
work
have
not
represented
a
great
annual
sum
such
as
the
work
demands
but
the
amount
being
expended
from
year
to
year
is
steadily
increasing
in
serious
emergencies
there
is
something
during
the
past
two
years
to
relieve
the
society
of
a
portion
of
this
particular
burden
the
director
of
the
park
secured
several
large
subscriptions
from
persons
outside
the
society
who
previously
had
never
entered
into
this
work
the
milwaukee
public
museum
has
entered
actively
and
effectively
into
the
fight
to
preserve
the
birds
of
wisconsin
from
annihilation
by
the
element
that
three
years
ago
determined
to
repeal
the
best
bird
laws
on
the
books
and
throw
the
shooting
privilege
wide
open
henry
ward
director
of
the
museum
went
to
the
firing
line
and
remained
there
last
year
the
saloon
element
thought
that
they
had
a
large
majority
of
the
votes
in
the
legislature
pledged
to
vote
their
way
it
looked
like
it
but
when
the
decent
people
again
rose
and
demanded
justice
for
the
birds
the
members
of
the
legislature
stood
by
them
in
large
majorities
the
and
laws
were
repealed
the
university
of
kansas
lawrence
scored
heavily
for
the
cause
of
protection
when
in
it
gave
to
the
governor
of
the
state
the
services
of
a
member
of
its
faculty
professor
lewis
lindsay
dyche
who
was
wanted
to
fill
the
position
of
state
fish
and
game
commissioner
professor
dyche
proved
to
be
a
very
live
wire
and
his
activities
have
covered
the
state
of
kansas
to
its
farthest
corners
we
love
him
for
the
host
of
enemies
he
has
made
among
the
poachers
sportsmen
and
lawbreakers
generally
the
men
who
thought
they
had
the
pull
of
friendship
for
lawbreaking
were
first
warned
and
then
as
second
offenders
hauled
up
to
the
bar
one
and
all
the
more
the
destroyers
try
to
hound
the
commissioner
the
more
popular
is
he
with
the
great
solid
mass
of
good
citizens
who
believe
in
the
saving
of
wild
life
the
museum
of
comparative
zoology
has
at
last
made
a
beginning
in
the
field
of
protection
last
winter
while
the
great
battle
raged
over
the
wharton
bill
several
members
of
the
museum
staff
appeared
at
the
hearings
and
otherwise
worked
for
the
success
of
the
measure
it
was
most
timely
aid
and
very
much
needed
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
that
auspicious
beginning
will
be
continued
from
year
to
year
the
museum
should
keep
at
least
one
good
fighter
constantly
in
the
field
the
boston
society
of
natural
history
takes
a
very
active
part
in
promoting
the
preservation
of
the

and
in
resisting
the
attempts
of
the
destroyers
to
repeal
the
excellent

efforts

of

fully
established
in

as

practically
the
chief
credit

to
an
unfortunate
end

but
that
is
another
story
i
am
now
going
to
set
before
the
public
the
names
of
certain
institutions
largely
devoted
to
zoology
and
permeated
by
zoologists
which
thus
far
seem
to
have
entirely
ignored
the
needs
of
our

so
far
we
know

the
greatest
needs
of
the
cause
and
the
duty
of
the
hour
the
fate
of
wild
life
in
north
america
hangs
by
three
very
slender
threads
the
names
of
which
you
will
hardly
guess
unaided
they
are
labor
money
and
publicity
the
threads
are
slender
because
there
is
so
little
raw
material
in
them
we
do
not
need
money
with
which
to
buy
votes
or
influence
but
money
with
which
to
pay
workers
to
publish
things
to
arouse
the
american
people
to
sting
sportsmen
into
action
to
hire
wardens
to
prosecute
and
buy
refuges
for
wild
life
if
a
sufficient
amount
of
money
for
these
purposes
can
not
be
procured
then
as
sure
as
the
earth
continues
to
revolve
our
wild
life
will
pass
away
forever
this
is
no
cause
for
surprise
or
wonder
in
this
twentieth
century
money
is
essential
to
every
great
enterprise
whether
it
be
for
virtue
or
mischief
the
enemies
of
wild
life
and
the
people
who
support
them
are
very
powerful
the
man
whose
pocket
or
whose
personal
privilege
is
threatened
by
new
legislation
is
prompted
by
business
reasons
to
work
against
you
and
spend
money
in
protecting
his
interests
now
it
happens
that
the
men
of
ordinary
means
who
have
nothing
personal
at
stake
in
the
preservation
of
wild
life
save
sentimental
considerations
can
not
afford
to
leave
their
business
more
than
three
or
four
days
each
year
on
protection
affairs
yet
many
times
services
are
demanded
for
many
days
or
even
weeks
together
in
order
to
accomplish
results
bad
repeal
bills
must
be
fought
until

must
be
supported

however
in
asking
for
services
that
men
who
give
valuable
time
and
strength
to
the
cause
shall
not
be
allowed
to
take
their
expense
money
from
their
own
pockets
soldiers
on
the
firing
line
provide
the
sinews
of
war
that
come
from
the
paymaster
chest
campaigns
of
publicity
are
matters
of
tremendous
necessity
and
importance
but
their
successful
promotion
requires
hundreds
or
possibly
thousands
of
dollars
for
each
state
that
is
covered
i
believe
that
the
wealthy
men
and
women
of
america
are
the
most
liberal
givers
for
the
benefit
of
humanity
that
can
be
found
in
all
the
world
new
york
especially
contains
a
great
number
of
men
who
year
in
and
year
out
work
hard
for
money
in
order
to
give
it
away
the
depth
and
breadth
of
the
philanthropic
spirit
in
new
york
city
is
to
me
the
most
surprising
of
all
the
strange
impulses
that
sway
the
inhabitants
of
that
seething
mass
of
mixed
humanity
every
imaginable
cause
for
the
benefit
of
mankind
save
one
has
received
and
still
is
receiving
millions
of
gift
dollars
some
enterprises
for
the
transcendant
education
of
the
people
are
at
this
moment
hopelessly
wallowing
in
the
excess
of
wealth
that
has
been
thrust
upon
them
men
are
being
hired
at
high
salaries
to
help
spend
wealth
in
high
higher
highest
education
and
research
it
is
now
fashionable
to
bequeath
millions
to
certain
causes
that
do
not
need
them
in
the
least
in
education
there
is
a
mad
scramble
to
educate
every
young
man
to
the
topmost
notch
often
far
above
his
probable
station
in
life
and
into
tastes
and
wants
far
beyond
his
powers
to
maintain
in
all
this
however
there
would
be
no
cause
for
regret
if
the
wild
life
of
our
continent
were
not
in
such
a
grievous
state
if
we
felt
no
conscience
burden
for
those
who
come
after
us
we
would
not
care
where
the
millions
go
but
since
things
are
as
they
are
it
is
heartbreaking
to
see
the
cause
of
protection
actually
starving
or
at
the
best
subsisting
only
on
financial
husks
and
crumbs
while
less
important
causes
literally
flounder
in
surplus
wealth
this
regret
is
intensified
by
the
knowledge
that
no
other
cause
for
the
conservation
of
the
resources
most
valuable
to
mankind
will
a
dollar
go
so
far
or
bring
back
such
good
results
as
in
the
preservation
of
wild
life
the
promotion
of
the
bayne
bill
and
the
enactment
of
the
bayne
law
is
a
fair
example
that
law
is
on
the
statute
books
of
the
state
of
new
york
because
fifty
men
and
women
promptly
subscribed
to
a
fund
formed
with
special
reference
to
the
expenses
of
the
campaign
for
that
measure
and
the
uplift
of
that
victory
will
be
felt
for
years
to
come
just
as
it
already
has
been
in
massachusetts
at
one
time
i
was
tempted
to
show
the
financial
skeleton
in
the
closet
of
protection
by
inserting
here
a
statement
of
the
funds
available
to
be
expended
by
all
the
new
york
organizations
during
the
campaign
year
of
but
i
can
not
do
it
the
showing
is
too
painful
too
humiliating
from
it
our
enemies
would
derive
too
much
comfort
even
in
new
york
state
in
view
of
the
great
interests
at
stake
the
showing
is
pitiful
but
what
shall
we
say
of
massachusetts
pennsylvania
connecticut
new
jersey
and
a
dozen
other
states
where
the
situation
is
much
worse
in
the
winter
of
a
cry
for
help
came
to
us
from
a
neighboring
state
where
a
terrific
fight
was
being
made
by
the
forces
of
destruction
against
all
reform
measures
and
in
behalf
of
retrogression
on
spring
shooting
the
appeal
said
the
situation
in
our
legislature
is
the
worst
that
it
has
been
in
years
our
enemies
are
very
strong
well
organized
and
they
fight
us
at
every
step
we
have
and
we
are
expected
to
make
bricks
without
straw
is
there
not
that
you
can
do
to
help
us
there
was
only
one
week
previously
a
good
friend
who
declines
to
be
named
gave
us
thousand
of
real
money
for
just
such
emergencies
within
hours
an
entirely
new
fighting
force
had
been
organized
and
equipped
for
service
within
one
week
those
reinforcements
had
made
a
profound
impression
on
the
defenses
of
the
enemy
and
in
the
end
the
great
fight
was
won
of
our
small
campaign
fund
it
took
away
over
one
thousand
dollars
but
the
victory
was
worth
it
with
money
enough
a
reasonable
sum
the
birds
of
north
america
and
some
of
the
species
also
can
be
saved
the
big
game
that
is
hunted
and
killed
outside
the
game
preserves
and
outside
of
such
places
as
new
brunswick
and
the
adirondacks
can
be
saved
until
is
given
perpetual
protection
colorado
is
saving
a
small
remnant
of
her
mountain
sheep
but
montana
and
wyoming
are
wasting
theirs
because
they
allow
killing
and
the
killers
are
ten
times
too
numerous
for
the
sheep
they
imagine
that
by
permitting
only
the
killing
of
rams
they
are
saving
the
species
but
that
is
an
absolute
fallacy
and
soon
it
will
have
a
fatal
ending
with
an
endowment
fund
of
only
double
the
price
of
the
two
old
velasquez
paintings
purchased
recently
by
a
gentleman
of
new
york
a
very
good
remnant
of
the
wild
life
of
north
america
could
be
saved
but
who
will
give
the
fund
or
even
a
quarter
of
it
thus
far
the
largest
sums
ever
given
in
america
for
the
cause
of
protection
so
far
as
i
know
personally
have
been
the

are

and
the
caroline

in

of

a

for

has
been
guaranteed
by
the
makers
of

and

to
the
american
game
protective
and

association
this
is
like
a
limited
endowment
in
the
civilized
world
there
are
citizens
of
many
kinds
but
all
of
them
can
be
placed
in
two
groups
those
with
a
sense
of
duty
toward
mankind
and
who
will
do
their
duty
as
good
citizens
and
those
who
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
meanly
and
sordidly
study
their
own
selfish
interests
who
never
do
aught
save
in
expectation
of
a
quick
return
benefit
and
who
recognize
no
such
thing
as
duty
toward
mankind
at
large
men
and
women
of
the
first
class
are
honored
in
life
mourned
when
dead
and
gratefully
remembered
by
posterity
they
leave
the
world
better
than
they
found
it
and
their
lives
have
been
successful
men
and
women
of
the
second
class
are
merely
so
many
pieces
of
animated
furniture
and
when
they
pass
out
the
world
cares
no
more
than
when
old
chairs
are
thrown
upon
the
there
are
many
men
so
selfish
so
ignorant
and
mean
of
soul
that
even
out
of
purses
they
would
not
give
ten
dollars
to
save
the
whole
bird
fauna
of
north
america
from
annihilation
to
all
persons
of
that
brand
it
is
useless
to
appeal
as
soon
as
you
find
one
waste
no
time
upon
him
get
out
of
his
neighborhood
as
quickly
as
you
can
and
look
for
help
among
real
men
the
wild
life
of
the
world
can
not
be
saved
by
a
few
persons
even
though
they
work
their
hearts
out
in
the
effort
the
cause
needs
two
million
more
helpers
and
they
must
be
sought
in
group
no
they
are
living
somewhere
but
the
great
trouble
is
to
find
them
it
is
too
there
are
times
and
causes
in
which
the
good
citizen
has
no
option
but
to
render
service
the
most
important
of
such
causes
are
the
relief
of
suffering
humanity
the
conservation
of
the
resources
of
nature
and
the
prevention
of
vandalism
if
the
american
nation
had
refused
aid
to
stricken
san
francisco
the
callous
of
it
would
have
shocked
the
world
if
the
german
army
of
had
destroyed
the
art
treasures
and
the
libraries
of
paris
it
would
have
set
the
german
nation
back
ten
centuries
into
the
ranks
of
the
lowest
barbarians
and
yet
in
america
and
in
the
regions
now
being
scourged
by
the
feather
trade
a
wonderful
fauna
is
being
destroyed
it
took
of
to
develop
that
marvelous
array
of
wild
life
and
when
gone
never
can
be
yet
the
army
of
destruction
is
sweeping
it
away
as
joyously
as
a
hired
laborer
cuts
down
a
field
of
corn
that
wild
life
be
saved
if
done
it
must
be
done
by
the
men
and
women
of
group
no
the
means
by
which
it
can
be
saved
are
and
every
man
ordinary
means
and
intelligence
can
contribute
either
money
or
labor
the
men
on
the
firing
line
must
not
be
expected
to
furnish
their
own
food
and
ammunition
the
workers
must
be
provided
with
the
money
that
active
campaign
work
imperatively
demands
those
who
can
not
conveniently
or
successfully
labor
should
give
money
to
this
cause
but
at
the
same
time
every
good
citizen
should
keep
in
touch
with
his
lawmaking
representatives
and
in
times
of
need
ask
for
votes
for
whatever
new
laws
are
necessary
with
money
enough
to
arouse
the
american
people
in
certain
ways
the
wild
life
of
north
america
north
of
mexico
can
be
saved
can
secure
labor
and
publicity
and
the
people
will
do
the
rest
for
this
campaign
work
i
want
must
a
permanent
fund
of
per
annum
cash
always
ready
for
every
emergency
in
field
work
i
greatly
need
must
have
an
endowment
fund
of
at
least
and
eventually
i
can
no
longer
pass
the
hat
each
year
this
is
needed
in
addition
to
the
several
thousands
of
dollars
annually
being
expended
by
the
zoological
society
in
this
work
the
society
is
already
doing
its
utmost
in
protection
just
as
it
is
in
several
other
fields
of
activity
outside
of
new
york
many
wealthy
men
will
say
let
new
york
do
it
that
often
is
the
way
when
national
campaigning
is
to
be
done
in
protection
work
new
york
is
bearing
about
of
the
burden
it
is
my
belief
that
in
outside
of
new
york
city
less
than
was
raised
and
expended
in
protection
save
by
state
and
national
appropriations
we
know
that
in
the
year
mentioned
new
york
expended
in
this
cause
all
from
private
sources
in
a
very
short
time
i
shall
call
for
the
that
i
now
must
have
as
an
endowment
fund
for
work
to
be
placed
at
per
cent
interest
for
the
annual
income
that
it
will
yield
how
much
of
this
will
come
from
outside
the
state
of
new
york
some
of
it
i
am
sure
will
come
from
massachusetts
and
pennsylvania
but
will
any
of
it
come
from
cleveland
cincinnati
chicago
louis
and
san
francisco
the
duty
of
the
hour
i
have
now
said
my
say
in
behalf
of
wild
life
surely
the
path
of
duty
toward
the
remnant
of
wild
life
is
plain
enough
will
those
who
read
this
book
pass
along
my
message
that
the
hour
for
a
revolution
has
struck
will
the
millions
of
men
commanded
by
general
apathy
now
arouse
before
it
is
too
late
to
act
will
the
true
sportsmen
rise
up
and
do
their
duty
bravely
and
unselfishly
will
the
people
with
wealth
to
give
away
do
their
duty
toward
wild
life
and
humanity
fairly
and
generously
will
the
zoologists
awake
leave
their
tables
in
their
stone
palaces
of
peace
and
come
out
to
the
will
the
lawmakers
heed
the
handwriting
on
the
wall
and
make
laws
that
represent
the
full
discharge
of
their
duty
toward
wild
life
and
humanity
will
the
editors
beat
the
early
and
late
in
season
and
out
of
season
until
the
people
awake
on
the
answers
to
these
questions
