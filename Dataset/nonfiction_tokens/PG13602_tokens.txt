may
tr
original
index
refers
to
allen
rev
uncle
wash
however
this
informant
is
different
from
the
next
informant
rev
allen
the
story
of
uncle
wash
as
he
is
familiarly
known
is
condensed
as
follows
he
was
born
on
the
plantation
of
a
washington
allen
of
south
carolina
for
whom
he
was
named
this
allen
had
several
sons
and
daughters
and
of
these
one
son
george
allen
who
during
the
left
his
south
carolina
home
and
settled
near
lafayette
alabama
about
washington
allen
died
and
the
next
year
when
wash
was
a
old
shaver
the
allen
estate
in
south
carolina
was
divided
all
except
the
allen
negro
slaves
these
at
the
instance
and
insistence
of
george
allen
were
taken
to
lafayette
alabama
to
be
sold
all
were
put
on
the
block
and
auctioned
off
george
allen
buying
every
negro
so
that
not
a
single
slave
family
was
divided
up
uncle
wash
does
not
remember
what
he
fetched
at
de
sale
but
he
does
distinctly
remember
that
as
he
stepped
up
on
the
block
to
be
sold
the
auctioneer
ran
his
hand
over
my
head
and
said
genilmens
dis
boy
is
as
fine
as
split
silk
then
when
george
allen
had
bought
all
the
allen
slaves
it
dawned
upon
them
and
they
appreciated
why
he
had
insisted
on
their
being
sold
in
alabama
rather
than
in
south
carolina
before
he
was
six
years
of
age
little
wash
lost
his
mother
and
from
then
until
freedom
he
was
personally
cared
for
and
looked
after
by
george
allen
and
the
old
man
wept
every
time
he
mentioned
her
name
during
the
uncle
wash
father
drove
a
mail
and
passenger
stage
between
cusseta
and
lafayette
alabama
and
finally
died
and
was
buried
at
lafayette
by
the
side
of
his
wife
uncle
wash
drifted
over
to
columbus
about
fifty
years
ago
and
is
now
living
with
his
two
surviving
children
he
has
been
married
four
times
all
his
wives
dying
nachul

four
chillun
he
was
taught
to
read
and
write
by
the
sons
and
daughters
of
george
allen
and
attended
church
where
a
white
preacher
named
terrentine
preached
to
the
slaves
each
sunday
evenin
afternoon
the
salary
of
this
preacher
was
paid
by
george
allen
when
asked
what
this
preacher
usually
preached
about

in
a
second
interview
the
submission
of
which
was
voluntarily
sought
by
himself
this
very
interesting
specimen
of
a
rapidly
vanishing
type
expressed
a
desire
to
amend
his
previous
interview
of
may
to
incorporate
the
following
facts
for
a
number
of
years
before
freedom
my
father
bought
his
time
from
his
master
and
traveled
about
over
russell
county
alabama
as
a
journeyman
blacksmith
doing
work
for
various
planters
and
making
good
money
as
money
went
in
those
days
on
the
side
at
the
close
of
the
war
however
though
he
had
a
trunk
full
of
confederate
money
all
of
his
good
money
was
gone
father
could
neither
read
nor
write
but
had
a
good
head
for
figures
and
was
very
pious
his
life
had
a
wonderful
influence
upon
me
though
i
was
originally
worldly
that
is
i
drank
and
cussed
but
have
touched
a
drop
of
spirits
in
forty
years
and
quit
cussing
before
i
entered
the
ministry
in
i
learned
to
pray
when
very
young
and
kept
it
up
even
in
my
unsaved
days
my
white
master
folks
knew
me
to
be
a
praying
boy
and
asked
me
in
when
the
south
was
about
whipped
and
general
wilson
was
headed
our
way
to
pray
to
god
to
hold
the
yankees
back
of
course
i
did
have
any
love
for
any
yankees
and
have
now
for
that
matter
but
i
told
my
white
folks
that
i
pray
along
those
lines
i
told
them
that
while
i
loved
them
and
would
do
any
reasonable
praying
for
them
i
could
not
pray
against
my
conscience
that
i
not
only
wanted
to
be
free
but
that
i
wanted
to
see
all
the
negroes
freed
i
then
told
them
that
god
was
using
the
yankees
to
scourge
the
just
as
he
had
centuries
before
used
heathens
and
outcasts
to
chastise
his
chosen
people
the
children
of
israel
here
it
is
to
be
noted
that
for
a
slave
boy
of
between
approximately
and
years
of
age
remarkable
familiarity
with
the
old
testament
was
displayed
the
parson
then
entered
into
a
mild
tirade
against
yankees
saying
the
only
time
the
northern
people
ever
helped
the
nigger
was
when
they
freed
him
they
are
not
friends
of
the
negro
and
many
a
time
from
my
pulpit
have
i
warned
niggers
about
going
north
no
sir
the
colored
man
does
belong
in
the
north
no
business
up
there
and
you
may
tell
the
world
that
the
reverend
allen
makes
no
bones
about
saying
that
he
also
says
that
if
it
was
for
the
influence
of
the
white
race
in
the
south
the
negro
race
would
revert
to
savagery
within
a
year
why
if
they
knew
for
dead
certain
that
there
was
not
a
policeman
or
officer
of
the
law
in
columbus
tonight
the
good
lord
only
knows
what
they
do
tonight
when
the
good
parson
had
delivered
himself
as
quoted
he
was
asked
a
few
questions
the
answers
to
which
as
shall
follow
disclose
their
nature
the
lowest
down
whites
of
slavery
days
were
the
average
overseers
a
few
were
gentlemen
one
must
admit
but
the
regular
run
of
them
were
trash
commoner
than
the
white
trash
and
if
possible
their
children
were
worse
than
their
daddies
the
name
was
a
synonym
for
driver
no
sir
a
nigger
may
be
humble
and
refuse
to
talk
outside
of
his
race
because
afraid
to
but
you
ca
fool
him
about
a
white
man
and
you
could
fool
him
when
he
was
a
slave
he
knows
a
white
man
for
what
he
is
and
he
knew
him
the
same
way
in
slavery
times
concerning
the
punishment
of
slaves
the
reverend
said
i
never
heard
or
knew
of
a
slave
being
tried
in
court
for
any
thing
i
never
knew
of
a
slave
being
guilty
of
any
crime
more
serious
than
taking
something
or
violating
plantation
rules
and
the
only
punishment
that
i
ever
heard
or
knew
of
being
administered
slaves
was
whipping
i
have
personally
known
a
few
slaves
that
were
beaten
to
death
for
one
or
more
of
the
following
offenses
leaving
home
without
a
pass
talking
back
to
a
white
person
hitting
another
negro
fussing
fighting
and
rukkussing
in
the
quarters
lying
loitering
on
their
work
taking
things
the
whites
called
it
stealing
plantation
rules
forbade
a
slave
to
own
a
firearm
leave
home
without
a
pass
sell
or
buy
anything
without
his
master
consent

without
his

assist
a
runaway
slave
abuse
a
farm
animal
mistreat
a
member
of
his
family
and
do
a
great
many
other
things
when
asked
if
he
had
ever
heard
slaves
plot
an
insurrection
the
parson
answered
in
the
negative
when
asked
if
he
had
personal
knowledge
of
an
instance
of
a
slave
offering
resistance
to
corporal
punishment
the
reverend
shook
his
head
but
said
sometimes
a
stripped
nigger
would
say
some
hard
things
to
the
white
man
with
the
strap
in
his
hand
though
he
knew
that
he
the
negro
would
pay
for
it
dearly
for
when
a
slave
showed
spirit
that
way
the
master
or
overseer
laid
the
lash
on
all
the
harder
when
asked
how
the
women
took
their
whippings
he
said
they
usually
screamed
and
prayed
though
a
few
never
made
a
sound
the
parson
has
had
two
wives
and
five
children
both
wives
and
three
of
his
children
are
dead
he
is
also
now
superannuated

whitley
hw
dis
unedited
minnie
ross
ex
town
slave
hannah
austin
hw
about
apr
when
the
writer
was
presented
to
hannah
austin
she
was
immediately
impressed
with
her
alert
youthful
appearance
austin
is
well
preserved
for
her
age
and
speaks
clearly
and
with
much
intelligence
the
interview
was
a
brief
but
interesting
one
this
was
due
partly
to
the
fact
that
austin
was
a
small
child
when
the
civil
war
ended
and
too
because
her
family
was
classed
as
town
slaves
so
classed
because
of
their
superior
intelligence
austin
was
a
child
of
ten
or
twelve
years
when
the
war
ended
she
does
know
her
exact
age
but
estimated
it
to
be
between
seventy
and
seventy
five
years
she
was
born
the
oldest
child
of
liza
and
george
hall
their
master
frank
hall
was
very
kind
to
them
and
considerate
in
his
treatment
of
them
briefly
austin
gave
the
following
account
of
slavery
as
she
knew
it
my
family
lived
in
a
two
room
well
built
house
which
had
many
windows
and
a
nice
large
porch
our
master
hall
was
a
merchant
and
operated
a
clothing
store
because
hall
lived
in
town
he
did
not
need
but
a
few
slaves
my
family
which
included
my
mother
father
sister
and
myself
were
his
only
servants
originally
hall
did
not
own
any
slaves
however
after
marrying
hall
we
were
given
to
her
by
her
father
as
a
part
of
her
inheritance
my
mother
nursed
hall
from
a
baby
consequently
the
hall
family
was
very
fond
of
her
and
often
made
the
statement
that
they
would
not
part
with
her
for
anything
in
the
world
besides
working
as
the
cook
for
the
hall
family
my
mother
was
also
a
fine
seamstress
and
made
clothing
for
the
master
family
and
for
our
family
we
were
allowed
an
ample
amount
of
good
clothing
which
hall
selected
from
the
stock
in
his
store
my
father
worked
as
a
porter
in
the
store
and
did
other
jobs
around
the
house
i
did
not
have
to
work
and
spent
most
of
my
time
playing
with
the
hall
children
we
were
considered
the
better
class
of
slaves
and
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
a
hard
time
other
slave
owners
whipped
their
slaves
severely
and
often
but
i
have
never
known
our
master
to
whip
any
one
of
my
family
if
any
one
in
the
family
became
ill
the
family
doctor
was
called
in
as
often
as
he
was
needed
we
did
not
have
churches
of
our
own
but
were
allowed
to
attend
the
white
churches
in
the
afternoon
the
white
families
attended
in
the
forenoon
we
seldom
heard
a
true
religious
sermon
but
were
constantly
preached
the
doctrine
of
obedience
to
our
masters
and
mistresses
we
were
required
to
attend
church
every
sunday
marriages
were
conducted
in
much
the
same
manner
as
they
are
today
after
the
usual
courtship
a
minister
was
called
in
by
the
master
and
the
marriage
ceremony
would
then
take
place
in
my
opinion
people
of
today
are
more
lax
in
their
attitude
toward
marriage
than
they
were
in
those
days
following
the
marriage
of
a
slave
couple
a
celebration
would
take
place
often
the
master
and
his
family
would
take
part
in
the
celebration
i
remember
hearing
my
mother
and
father
discuss
the
war
but
was
too
young
to
know
just
the
effect
the
war
would
have
on
the
slave
one
day
i
remember
hall
coming
to
my
mother
telling
her
we
were
free
his
exact
words
were
quote
liza
you
do
belong
to
me
any
longer
you
belong
to
yourself
if
you
are
hired
now
i
will
have
to
pay
you
i
do
not
want
you
to
leave
as
you
have
a
home
here
as
long
as
you
live
i
watched
my
mother
to
see
the
effect
his
words
would
have
on
her
and
i
saw
her
eyes
fill
with
tears
hall
eyes
filled
with
tears
also
soon
after
this
incident
a
yankee
army
appeared
in
our
village
one
day
they
practically
destroyed
hall
store
by
throwing
all
clothes
and
other
merchandise
into
the
streets
seeing
my
sister
and
i
they
turned
to
us
saying
little
negroes
you
are
free
there
are
no
more
masters
and
mistresses
here
help
yourselves
to
these
clothes
take
them
home
with
you
not
knowing
any
better
we
carried
stockings
socks
dresses
underwear
and
many
other
pieces
home
after
this
they
opened
the
smoke
house
door
and
told
us
to
go
in
and
take
all
of
the
meat
we
wanted
on
another
occasion
the
mistress
called
me
asking
that
i
come
in
the
yard
to
play
with
the
children
here
austin
began
to
laugh
and
remarked
i
did
not
go
but
politely
told
her
i
was
free
and
belong
to
any
one
but
my
mama
and
papa
as
i
spoke
these
words
my
mistress
began
to
cry
my
mother
and
father
continued
to
live
with
the
halls
even
after
freedom
and
until
their
deaths
although
not
impoverished
most
of
the
fortune
was
wiped
out
with
the
war
austin
married
at
the
age
of
years
and
was
the
mother
of
four
children
all
of
whom
are
dead
she
was
very
ambitious
and
was
determined
to
get
an
education
if
such
was
possible
after
the
war
northern
white
people
came
south
and
set
up
schools
for
the
education
of
negroes
she
remembers
the
organization
of
the
old
storrs
school
from
which
one
of
the
present
negroes
colleges
originated
austin
proudly
spoke
of
her
old
blue
back
speller
which
she
still
possesses
and
of
the
days
when
she
attended
storrs
school
as
the
writer
made
ready
to
depart
austin
smilingly
informed
her
that
she
had
told
her
all
that
she
knew
about
slavery
and
every
word
spoken
was
the
truth

has
a
remarkably
clear
memory
in
view
of
the
fact
that
she
is
about
years
of
age
before
the
interview
began
she
reminded
the
writer
that
the
facts
to
be
related
were
either
told
to
her
by
her
grandmother

or
were
facts

lenora
and
silas
heard
there
were

she
and
her
family
were
owned
by
peter
heard
in
those
days
the
slaves
carried
the
surname
of
their
master
this
accounted
for
all
slaves
having
the
same
name
whether
they
were
kin
or
not
the
owner
heard
had
a
plantation
of
about
acres
and
was
considered
wealthy
by
all
who
knew
him
avery
was
unable
to
give
the
exact
number
of
slaves
on
the
plantation
but
knew
he
owned
a
large
number
cotton
corn
peas
potatoes
etc
were
the
main
crops
raised
the
homes
provided
for
the
slaves
were
two
room
log
cabins
which
had
one
door
and
one
window
these
homes
were
not
built
in
a
group
together
but
were
more
or
less
scattered
over
the
plantation
slave
homes
were
very
simple
and
only
contained
a
home
made
table
chair
and
bed
which
were
made
of
the
same
type
of
wood
and
could
easily
be
cleaned
by
scouring
with
sand
every
saturday
the
beds
were
bottomed
with
rope
which
was
run
backward
and
forward
from
one
rail
to
the
other
on
this
framework
was
placed
a
mattress
of
wheat
straw
each
spring
the
mattresses
were
emptied
and
refilled
with
fresh
wheat
straw
slaves
were
required
to
prepare
their
own
meals
three
times
a
day
this
was
done
in
a
big
open
fire
place
which
was
filled
with
hot
coals
the
master
did
not
give
them
much
of
a
variety
of
food
but
allowed
each
family
to
raise
their
own
vegetables
each
family
was
given
a
hand
out
of
bacon
and
meal
on
saturdays
and
through
the
week
corn
ash
cakes
and
meat
which
had
been
broiled
on
the
hot
coals
was
the
usual
diet
found
in
each
home
the
diet
did
not
vary
even
at
christmas
only
a
little
fruit
was
added
each
family
was
provided
with
a
loom
and
in
avery
family
her
grandmother
sylvia
heard
did
most
of
the
carding
and
spinning
of
the
thread
into
cloth
the
most
common
cloth
for
women
clothes
was
homespun
and
calico
this
same
cloth
was
dyed
and
used
to
make

and
pants

prepared
by
taking
a
berry
known
as
the
shumake
berry
and
boiling
them
with
walnut
peelings
spring
and
fall
were
the
seasons
for
masters
to
give
shoes
and
clothing
to
their
slaves
both
men
and
women
wore
brogan
shoes
the
only
difference
being
the
piece
in
the
side
of
the
womens
one
woman
was
required
to
do
the
work
around
the
house
there
was
also
one
slave
man
required
to
work
around
the
house
doing
odd
jobs
other
than
these
two
every
one
else
was
required
to
do
the
heavy
work
in
the
fields
work
began
at
sun
up
and
lasted
until
sun
down
in
the
middle
of
the
day
the
big
bell
was
rung
to
summon
the
workers
from
the
field
for
their
lunch
after
work
hours
slaves
were
then
free
to
do
work
around
their
own
cabins
such
as
sewing
cooking
etc
once
a
week
heard
allowed
his
slaves
to
have
a
frolic
and
folks
would
get
broke
down
from
so
much
dancing
avery
remarked
the
music
was
furnished
with
fiddles
when
asked
how
the
slaves
came
to
own
fiddles
she
replied
they
bought
them
with
money
they
earned
selling
chickens
at
night
slaves
would
steal
off
from
the
heard
plantation
go
to
lagrange
and
sell
chickens
which
they
had
raised
of
course
the
masters
always
required
half
of
every
thing
raised
by
each
slave
and
it
was
not
permissible
for
any
slave
to
sell
anything
another
form
of
entertainment
was
the
quilting
party
every
one
would
go
together
to
different
person
home
on
each
separate
night
of
the
week
and
finish
that
person
quilts
each
night
this
was
repeated
until
every
one
had
a
sufficient
amount
of
covering
for
the
winter
any
slave
from
another
plantation
desiring
to
attend
these
frolics
could
do
so
after
securing
a
pass
from
their
master
avery
related
the
occasion
when
her
uncle
william
was
caught
off
the
heard
plantation
without
a
pass
and
was
whipped
almost
to
death
by
the
pader
rollers
he
stole
off
to
the
depths
of
the
woods
here
he
built
a
cave
large
enough
to
live
in
a
few
nights
later
he
came
back
to
the
plantation
unobserved
and
carried
his
wife
and
two
children
back
to
this
cave
where
they
lived
until
after
freedom
when
found
years
later
his
wife
had
given
birth
to
two
children
no
one
was
ever
able
to
find
his
hiding
place
and
if
he
saw
any
one
in
the
woods
he
would
run
like
a
lion
heard
was
a
very
mean
master
and
was
not
liked
by
any
one
of
his
slaves
secretly
each
one
hated
him
he
whipped
unmercifully
and
in
most
cases
unnecessarily
however
he
sometimes
found
it
hard
to
subdue
some
slaves
who
happened
to
have
very
high
tempers
in
the
event
this
was
the
case
he
would
set
a
pack
of
hounds
on
him
avery
related
to
the
writer
the
story
told
to
her
of
heard
cruelty
by
her
grandmother
the
facts
were
as
follows
every
morning
my
grandmother
would
pray
and
old
man
heard
despised
to
hear
any
one
pray
saying
they
were
only
doing
so
that
they
might
become
free
niggers
just
as
sure
as
the
sun
would
rise
she
would
get
a
whipping
but
this
did
not
stop
her
prayers
every
morning
before
day
this
particular
time
grandmother
sylvia
was
in
family
way
and
that
morning
she
began
to
pray
as
usual
the
master
heard
her
and
became
so
angry
he
came
to
her
cabin
seized
and
pulled
her
clothes
from
her
body
and
tied
her
to
a
young
sapling
he
whipped
her
so
brutally
that
her
body
was
raw
all
over
when
darkness
fell
her
husband
cut
her
down
from
the
tree
during
the
day
he
was
afraid
to
go
near
her
rather
than
go
back
to
the
cabin
she
crawled
on
her
knees
to
the
woods
and
her
husband
brought
grease
for
her
to
grease
her
raw
body
for
two
weeks
the
master
hunted
but
could
not
find
her
however
when
he
finally
did
she
had
given
birth
to
twins
the
only
thing
that
saved
her
was
the
fact
that
she
was
a
and
always
carried
a
small
pin
knife
which
she
used
to
cut
the
navel
cord
of
the
babies
after
doing
this
she
tore
her
petticoat
into
two
pieces
and
wrapped
each
baby
grandmother
sylvia
lived
to
get
years
old
not
only
was
henderson
cruel
but
it
seemed
that
every
one
he
hired
in
the
capacity
of
overseer
was
just
as
cruel
for
instance
henderson
grandmother
sylvia
was
told
to
take
her
clothes
off
when
she
reached
the
end
of
a
row
she
was
to
be
whipped
because
she
had
not
completed
the
required
amount
of
hoeing
for
the
day
grandmother
continued
hoeing
until
she
came
to
a
fence
as
the
overseer
reached
out
to
grab
her
she
snatched
a
fence
railing
and
broke
it
across
his
arms
on
another
occasion
grandmother
sylvia
ran
all
the
way
to
town
to
tell
the
master
that
an
overseer
was
beating
her
husband
to
death
the
master
immediately
jumped
on
his
horse
and
started
for
home
and
reaching
the
plantation
he
ordered
the
overseer
to
stop
whipping
the
old
man
avery
received
one
whipping
with
a
hair
brush
for
disobedience
this
was
given
to
her
by
the
mistress
slaves
were
given
separate
churches
but
the
minister
who
conducted
the
services
was
white
very
seldom
did
the
text
vary
from
the
usual
one
of
obedience
to
the
master
and
mistress
and
the
necessity
for
good
behavior
every
one
was
required
to
attend
church
however
the
only
self
expression
they
could
indulge
in
without
conflict
with
the
master
was
that
of
singing
any
one
heard
praying
was
given
a
good
whipping
for
most
masters
thought
their
prayers
no
good
since
freedom
was
the
uppermost
thought
in
every
one
head
on
the
heard
plantation
as
on
a
number
of
others
marriages
were
made
by
the
masters
of
the
parties
concerned
marriage
licenses
were
unheard
of
if
both
masters
mutually
consented
the
marriage
ceremony
was
considered
over
with
after
that
the
husband
was
given
a
pass
to
visit
his
wife
once
a
week
in
the
event
children
were
born
the
naming
of
them
was
left
entirely
to
the
master
parents
were
not
allowed
to
name
them
health
of
slaves
was
very
important
to
every
slave
owner
for
loss
of
life
meant
loss
of
money
to
them
consequently
they
would
call
in
their
family
doctor
if
a
slave
became
seriously
ill
in
minor
cases
of
illness
home
remedies
were
used
in
fact
avery
smilingly
remarked
we
used
every
thing
for
medicine
that
grew
in
the
ground
one
particular
home
remedy
was
known
as
cow
foot
oil
which
was
made
by
boiling
cow
feet
in
water
other
medicines
used
were
hoarhound
tea
catnip
tea
and
castor
oil
very
often
medicines
and
doctors
failed
to
save
life
and
whenever
a
slave
died
he
was
buried
the
same
day
avery
remarked
if
he
died
before
dinner
the
funeral
and
burial
usually
took
place
immediately
after
dinner
although
a
very
young
child
avery
remembers
the
frantic
attempt
slave
owners
made
to
hide
their
money
when
the
war
broke
out
the
following
is
a
story
related
concerning
the
heard
family
heard
our
master
went
to
the
swamp
dug
a
hole
and
hid
his
money
then
he
and
his
wife
left
for
town
on
their
horses
my
oldest
brother
percy
saw
their
hiding
place
and
when
the
yanks
came
looking
for
the
money
he
carried
them
straight
to
the
swamps
and
showed
than
where
the
money
was
hidden
although
the
yeard
tr
typo
heard
farm
was
in
the
country
the
highway
was
very
near
and
avery
told
of
the

song

around
the

broke
the
news
to
each
family
that
they
were
free
people
and
if
they
so
desired
could
remain

plantation
avery
family
moved
away
in
fact
most
slave
families
did
for
old
man
heard
had
been
such
a
cruel
master
everyone
was
anxious
to
get
away
from
him
however
one
year
later
he
sold
his
plantation
to
mr
george
traylor
and
some
of
the
families
moved
back
avery

as
a
humane
man
though
inclined
to
use
the
whip
when
occasion
demanded
followed
to
its
conclusion
alice
life
history
is
void
of
thrills
and
simply
an
average
story
as

was
well
fed
well
clothed
and
well
treated
as
were
her
brother
and
sister
slaves
her

a

both
housework

alice
married
a
battle
nigger
since
the
early
alice

shade
of

brightly
under

in
baltimore
a
negro
suburb
of
in
a
little
old
tumbled
down
kind
of
a
cottage
that
used
to
be
one
of
the
neatest
and
best
houses
of
the
settlement
and
where
she
has
lived
for
the
past
years
in
the
yard
of
her
home
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
holly
trees
to
be
found
anywhere
she
set
it
there
herself
over
fifty
years
ago
she
recalled
how
her
friends
predicted
bad
luck
would
befall
her
because
she
sot
out
er
holly
but
not
being
in
the
least
bit
superstitious
she
paid
them
no
mind
and
has
enjoyed
her
beautiful
tree
all
these
years
many
lovely
oaks
are
around
her
house
she
set
them
there
long
ago
when
she
was
young
and
with
her
husband
moved
into
their
new
home
and
wanted
to
make
it
as
attractive
as
possible
she
is
all
alone
now
her
husband
died
some
years
ago
and
three
of
her
four
children
have
passed
on
her
preacher
son
who
was
her
delight
died
not
very
long
ago
all
this
sorrow
has
left
aunt
arrie
old
and
sad
her
face
is
no
longer
lighted
by
the
smile
it
used
to
know
she
is
a
tiny
little
scrap
of
a
woman
with
the
softest
voice
and
is
as
neat
as
can
be
she
wears
an
oldfashioned
apron
all
the
time
and
in
cool
weather
there
is
always
a
little
black
cape
around
her
frail
shoulders
and
held
together
with
a
plain
old
gold
breastpin
she
was
born
in
lincoln
county
georgia
her
mother
was
emeline
sybert
and
her
father
jordan
sybert
they
belonged
to
jones
sybert
and
his
wife
miss
peggy
after
freedom
they
changed
their
surname
to
gullatt
as
they
liked
that
better
arrie
was
among
the
oldest
of
nine
children
the
night
she
was
born
the
stork
brought
a
little
baby
girl
to
the
home
of
a
white
family
just
across
the
creek
from
the
syberts
the
little
white
girl
was
named
arine
so
miss
peggy
named
the
little
new
black
baby
girl
arrie
and
that
is
how
it
happened
she
was
given
such
an
odd
name
arrie
said
she
was
or
years
old
when
the
war
broke
i
wuz
big
enough
to
be
lookin
at
boys
an
dey
lookin
at
me
she
remembers
the
days
of
war
how
when
the
battle
of
atlanta
was
raging
they
heard
the
distant
rumble
of
cannon
and
how
upsot
they
all
were
her
master
died
of
the
consumption
during
the
war
she
recalls
how
hard
it
was
after
his
death
the
syberts
had
no
children
and
there
was
no
one
to
turn
to
after
his
death
arrie
tells
of
her
master
illness
how
she
was
the
housemaid
and
was
called
upon
to
fan
him
and
how
she
would
get
so
tired
and
sleepy
she
would
nod
a
little
the
fan
dropping
from
hands
into
his
face
he
would
take
it
up
and
crack
my
haid
with
the
handle
to
wake
me
up
i
wuz
allus
so
sorry
when

but

she
told
about
how
bad
the
overseers
were
and
the
trouble
they
gave
until
finally
old
miss
turned
off
ther
one
she
had
an
put
my
pa
in
his
place
to
manage
things
and
look
after
the
work
arrie
was
never
punished
not
any
more
than
having
her
head
cracked
by
her
master
when
she
nodded
while
fanning
him

with
a
little
chuckle
the
old
cream
horse
toby
she
use
to
plow
she
loved
toby
she
said
and
they
did
good
work
when
not

she
said
she
picked
er
round
in
the
fields
doing
whatever
she
could
she
and
the
other
slaves
were
not
required
to
do
very
hard
work
her
mother
was
a
field
hand
but
in
the
evenings
she
spun
and
wove
down
in
their
cabin
aunt
arrie
added
an
i
did
love
to
hear
that
old
wheel
it
made
a
low
kind
of
a
whirring
sound
that
made
me
sleepy
she
said
her
mother
with
all
the
other
negro
women
on
the
place
had
a
task
of
spinnin
a
spool
at
night
and
they
spun
and

on
rainy
days

some
blue
and
brown
striped
we
growed
the
indigo
she
used
fer
the
blue
right
dar
on
the
plantation
and
she
used
bark
and
leaves
to
make
the
tan
and
brown
colors
aunt
arrie
said
the
doctor

always
called

this
was
made
by
taking
a
few
clean
ashes
from
the
fire
place
putting
them
in
a
little
thin
bag
and
pouring
boiling
water
over
them
and
let
set
for
a
few
minutes
this

it
that

made
by
pouring
boiling
water
over
lightwood
splinters
aunt
arrie
told
of
their
life
on
the
plantation
and
it
was
not
unlike
that
of
other
slaves
who
had
good
masters
who
looked
after
them
they
had
plenty
to
eat
and
to
wear
their
food
was
given
them
and
they
cooked
and
ate
their
meals
in
the
cabins
in
family
groups
santa
claus
always
found
his
way
to
the
quarters
and
brought
them
stick
candy
and
other
things
to
eat
she
said
for
their
christmas
dinner
there
was
always
a
big
fat
hen
and
a
hog
head
in
slavery
days
the
negroes
had
quiltings
dances
picnics
and
everybody
had
a
good
time
aunt
arrie
said
an
i
kin
dance
yit
when
i
hears
a
fiddle
they
had
their
work
to
do
in
the
week
days
but
when
sundays
came
there
was
no
work
everybody
rested
and
on
preachin
days
went
to
church
her
father
took
them
all
to
old
rehoboth
the
neighborhood
white
church
and
they
worshiped
together
white
and
black
the
negroes
in
the
gallery
that
was
back
in
the
days
when
there
was
no
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
when
in
church
no
matter
what
happened
no
one
could
even
half
way
smile
this
all
was
much
harder
than
having
to
listen
to
the
long
tiresome
sermons
of
those
days
arrie
thinks
specially
when
she
recalled
on
one
occasion
when
sutton
wuz
a
preachin
a
old
goat
hw
got
up
under
the
church
an
every
time

sad

said
that

ride

henry
bland
may
henry
bland
is
one
of
the
few
living
who
was
born
on
a
plantation
near
edenton
in
his
parents
were
martha
and
sam
coxton
in
this
family
group
were
three
other
children
two
girls
and
one
boy
who
was
the
oldest
when
questioned
regarding
the
birthplace
and
the
movements
of
his
parents
mr
bland
stated
that
his
father
was
born
in
hancock
county
his
mother
along
with
her
mother
was
brought
to
georgia
by
the
speculator
with
a
drove
of
other
slaves
the
first
thing
that
he
remembers
of
his
parents
is
when
he
was
quite
small
and
was
allowed
to
remain
in
the
master
kitchen
in
the
big
house
where
his
mother
was
cook
coxton
who
was
the
owner
of
mr
bland
and
his
family
was
described
as
being
very
rich
and
influential
man
in
the
community
where
he
lived
says
mr
bland
his
only
fault
was
that
of
drinking
too
much
of
the
whisky
that
he
distilled
on
the
plantation
unlike
some
of
the
other
slave
owners
in
that
section
coxton
was
very
kind
to
his
slaves
his
plantation
was
a
large
one
and
on
it
was
raised
cotton
corn
cane
tr
vegetables
and
live
stock
more
cotton
was
grown
than
anything
else
from
the
time
he
was
year
and
months
of
age
until
he
was
years
old
he
lived
in
the
big
house
with
his
mother
at
night
he
slept
on
the
floor
there
in
spite
of
this
his
and
his
mother
treatment
was
considerably
better
than
that
received
by
those
slaves
who
worked
in
the
fields
while
their
food
consisted
of
the
same
things
as
did
that
of
the
field
slaves
sometimes
choice
morsels
came
back
to
the
kitchen
from
the
master
table
he
says
that
his
mother
clothes
were
of
better
quality
than
the
other
slave
women
those
who
were
not
employed
in
the
house
as
a
child
his
first
job
was
to
cut
wood
for
the
stove
pick
up
chips
and
to
drive
the
cows
to
and
from
the
pasture
when
years
old
he
was
sent
to
the
field
as
a
plow
boy
here
he
worked
with
a
large
number
of
other
slaves
he
does
not
know
the
exact
number
who
were
divided
into
two
groups
the
plow
group
and
the
hoe
group
his
father
happened
to
be
the
foreman
of
the
hoe
gang
his
brothers
and
sisters
also
worked
here
in
the
fields
being
required
to
hoe
as
well
as
plow
when
picking
time
came
everyone
was
required
to
pick
the
usual
amount
of
cotton
each
person
was
required
to
pick
was
lbs
per
day
however
when
this
amount
was
not
picked
by
some
they
were
not
punished
by
the
overseer
as
was
the
case
on
neighboring
plantations
because
coxton
realized
that
some
could
do
more
work
than
others
coxton
often
told
his
overseer
that
he
had
not
been
hired
to
whip
the
slaves
but
to
teach
them
how
to
work
says
mr
bland
our
working
hours
were
the
same
as
on
any
other
plantation
we
had
to
get
up
every
morning
before
and
when
it
was
good
and
light
we
were
in
the
field
a
bugle
was
blown
to
wake
us
all
the
slaves
stayed
in
the
field
until
dark
after
leaving
the
field
they
were
never
required
to
do
any
work
but
could
spend
their
time
as
they
saw
fit
to
no
work
was
required
on
saturday
or
sunday
with
the
exception
that
the
stock
had
to
be
cared
for
besides
those
days
when
no
work
was
required
there
was
the
of
july
and
christmas
on
which
the
slaves
were
permitted
to
do
as
they
pleased
these
two
latter
dates
were
usually
spent
in
true
holiday
spirit
as
the
master
usually
gave
a
big
feast
in
the
form
of
a
barbecue
and
allowed
them
to
invite
their
friends
when
darkness
came
they
sang
and
danced
and
this
was
what
they
called
a
frolic
as
a
general
rule
this
same
thing
was
permitted
after
the
crops
had
been
gathered
music
for
these
occasions
was
furnished
by
violin
banjo
and
a
clapping
of
hands
mr
bland
says
that
he
used
to
help
furnish
this
music
as
coxton
had
bought
him
a
violin
on
the
coxton
plantation
all
slaves
always
had
a
sufficient
amount
of
clothing
these
clothes
which
were
issued
when
needed
and
not
at
any
certain
time
included
articles
for
sunday
wear
as
well
as
articles
for
work
those
servants
who
worked
in
the
big
house
wore
practically
the
same
clothes
as
the
master
and
his
wife
with
the
possible
exception
that
it
met
the
qualification
of
being
an
issue
of
work
clothing
included
a
heavy
pair
of
work
shoes
called
brogans
homespun
shirts
and
a
pair
of
jeans
pants
a
pair
of
knitted
socks
was
also
included
the
women
wore
homespun
dresses
for
their
working
clothes
for
sunday
wear
the
men
were
given
white
cotton
shirts
and
the
women
white
cotton
dresses
all
clothing
was
made
on
the
plantation
by
those
women
who
were
too
old
for
field
work
in
the
same
manner
that
clothing
was
sufficient
so
was
food
plentiful
at
the
end
of
each
week
each
family
was
given
lbs
of
meat
peck
of
meal
and
some
syrup
each
person
in
a
family
was
allowed
to
raise
a
garden
and
so
they
had
vegetables
whenever
they
wished
to
in
addition
to
this
they
were
allowed
to
raise
chickens
to
hunt
and
to
fish
however
none
of
the
food
that
was
secured
in
any
of
the
ways
mentioned
above
could
be
sold
when
anyone
wished
to
hunt
coxton
supplied
the
gun
and
the
shot
although
the
slaves
cooked
for
themselves
their
breakfast
and
dinner
were
usually
sent
to
them
in
the
fields
after
it
had
been
prepared
in
the
cook
house
the
reason
for
this
was
that
they
had
to
get
up
too
soon
in
the
morning
and
at
noon
too
much
time
would
be
lost
if
they
were
permitted
to
go
to
their
cabins
for
lunch
the
children
who
were
too
young
to
work
in
the
field
were
cared
for
by
some
old
slave
who
likewise
was
unable
to
do
field
work
the
children
were
usually
fed
pot
liquor
corn
bread
milk
syrup
and
vegetables
each
one
had
his
individual
cup
to
eat
from
the
food
on
sunday
was
usually
no
different
from
that
of
any
other
day
of
the
week
however
mr
bland
says
that
they
never
had
to
break
in
the
smokehouse
because
of
hunger
when
asked
to
describe
the
living
quarters
of
the
slaves
on
his
plantation
he
looked
around
his
room
and
muttered
dey
wuz
a
lot
better
than
dis
one
some
of
the
cabins
were
made
of
logs
and
some
of
weatherboards
the
chinks
in
the
walls
were
sealed
with
mud
in
some
instances
boards
were
used
on
the
inside
to
keep
the
weather
out
there
were
usually
two
windows
shutters
being
used
in
the
place
of
window
panes
the
chimney
and
fireplace
were
made
of
mud
and
stones
all
cooking
was
done
at
the
fireplace
as
none
of
them
were
provided
with
stoves
iron
cooking
utensils
were
used
to
boil
food
a
pot
was
hung
over
the
fire
by
means
of
a
hook
the
remaining
furniture
was
a
bench
which
served
as
a
chair
and
a
crude
bed
rope
running
from
side
to
side
served
as
bed
springs
the
mattress
was
made
of
straw
or
hay
for
lighting
purposes
pine
knots
and
candles
were
used
the
slaves
on
the
coxton
plantation
were
also
fortunate
in
that
all
cabins
had
good
floors
all
cabins
and
their
furnishings
were
built
by
the
slaves
who
learned
the
use
of
hammer
and
saw
from
white
artisans
whom
coxton
employed
from
time
to
time
mr
bland
remarked
that
his
father
was
a
blacksmith
having
learned
the
trade
in
this
manner
a
doctor
was
employed
regularly
by
coxton
to
minister
to
the
needs
of
the
slaves
in
time
of
illness
we
also
had
our
own
medicine
says
mr
bland
at
different
times
excursions
were
made
to
the
woods
where
yarbs
herbs
were
gathered
various
kinds
of
teas
and
medicines
were
made
by
boiling
these
roots
in
water
the
usual
causes
of
illness
on
this
plantation
were
colds
fevers
and
constipation
castor
oil
and
salts
were
also
used
to
a
great
extent
if
an
individual
was
too
ill
to
work
an
older
slave
had
to
nurse
this
person
no
effort
was
made
by
coxton
to
teach
his
slaves
anything
except
manual
training
a
slave
who
could
use
his
hands
at
skilled
work
was
more
valuable
than
the
ordinary
field
hand
if
however
a
slave
secured
a
book
coxton
would
help
him
learn
to
read
it
above
all
religious
training
was
not
denied
as
a
matter
of
fact
coxton
required
each
one
of
his
servants
to
dress
in
his
sunday
clothes
and
to
go
to
church
every
sunday
services
for
all
were
held
at
the
white
church
the
slaves
sitting
on
one
side
and
the
masters
on
the
other
all
preaching
was
done
by
a
white
pastor
no
promiscuous
relationships
were
allowed
if
a
man
wanted
to
marry
he
merely
pointed
out
the
woman
of
his
choice
to
the
master
he
in
turn
called
her
and
told
her
that
such
and
such
an
individual
wished
her
for
a
wife
if
she
agreed
they
were
pronounced
man
and
wife
and
were
permitted
to
live
together
the
slaves
on
his
plantation
were
great
believers
in
roots
and
their
values
in
the
use
of
conjuring
people
mr
bland
does
remember
ever
seeing
anyone
sold
by
coxton
but
he
heard
that
on
other
nearby
plantations
slaves
were
placed
on
an
auction
block
and
sold
like
cattle
none
of
the
slaves
were
ever
whipped
or
beaten
by
coxton
or
by
anyone
else
if
a
rule
was
broken
the
offender
was
called
before
coxton
where
he
was
talked
to
in
some
cases
a
whipping
was
promised
and
that
ended
the
matter
the
paddie
rollers
whipped
the
slaves
from
other
plantations
when
they
were
caught
off
of
their
premises
without
a
pass
but
this
was
never
the
case
when
a
slave
belonging
to
coxton
broke
this
rule
mr
bland
remembers
that
once
he
and
some
of
his
fellow
slaves
were
away
from
home
without
a
pass
when
they
were
seen
by
the
paddie
rollers
who
started
after
them
when
they
were
recognized
as
belonging
to
coxton
one
of
them
paddie
rollers
said
do
bother
them
that
them
d
niggers
the
paddie
rollers
were
not
allowed
to
come
on
the
coxton
plantation
to
whip
his
slaves
or
any
other
owner
slaves
who
happened
to
be
visiting
at
the
time
coxton
required
that
they
all
be
on
the
plantation
by
nightfall
the
above
seems
to
be
rather
conclusive
proof
of
coxton
influence
in
the
community
tr
parentheses
added
by
hand
whenever
a
slave
committed
a
crime
against
the
state
his
master
usually
had
to
pay
for
the
damage
done
or
pay
the
slave
fine
it
was
then
up
to
him
to
see
that
the
offender
was
punished
coxton
once
saw
him
mr
bland
beat
another
slave
who
was
a
guest
at
a
frolic
when
this
visitor
attempted
to
draw
a
pistol
on
him
mr
bland
was
upheld
in
his
action
and
told
by
coxton
that
he
had
better
always
fight
back
when
anyone
struck
him
whether
the
person
was
white
or
black
further
if
he
coxton
heard
of
his
not
fighting
back
a
whipping
would
be
in
store
for
him
coxton
was
different
from
some
of
the
slave
owners
in
that
he
gave
the
head
of
each
family
spending
money
at
christmas
time
the
amount
varying
with
the
size
of
the
family
when
the
civil
war
was
begun
the
master
seemed
to
be
worried
all
the
time
states
mr
bland
he
was
afraid
that
we
would
be
freed
and
then
he
would
have
to
hire
us
to
do
his
work
when
asked
to
describe
his
feelings
about
the
war
and
the
possibility
of
his
being
freed
mr
bland
said
that
he
had
no
particular
feeling
of
gladness
at
all
the
outcome
of
the
war
did
not
interest
him
at
all
because
coxton
was
such
a
good
master
he
did
care
whether
he
was
freed
or
not
his
fellow
slaves
felt
the
same
way
when
sherman
and
the
yankees
were
marching
through
they
took
all
of
the
live
stock
but
bothered
nothing
else
the
buildings
on
the
adjoining
plantation
were
all
burned
a
small
skirmish
took
place
about
miles
away
from
coxton
plantation
when
the
yankees
and
confederates
met
coxton
two
sons
took
part
in
the
war
mr
bland
was
taken
by
sherman
army
to
savannah
and
then
to
macon
he
says
that
he
saw
president
jeff
davis
give
up
his
sword
to
general
sherman
in
surrender
after
the
war
coxton
was
still
well
off
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
had
lost
quite
a
bit
of
money
as
a
result
of
the
war
he
saved
a
great
deal
of
his
cash
by
burying
it
when
sherman
came
through
the
cattle
might
have
been
saved
if
he
mr
bland
could
have
driven
them
into
the
woods
before
he
was
seen
by
some
of
the
soldiers
at
the
close
of
the
war
coxton
informed
all
the
slaves
that
they
were
free
to
go
where
they
wished
but
they
all
refused
to
leave
most
of
them
died
on
the
plantation
mr
bland
says
that
when
he
became
of
age
his
former
master
gave
him
a
wagon
two
mules
a
horse
and
buggy
and
ten
pigs
mr
bland
thinks
that
old
age
is
a
characteristic
in
his
family
his
grandmother
lived
to
be
years
old
and
his
mother
years
old
although
in
his
mr
bland
is
an
almost
perfect
picture
of
health
he
thinks
that
he
will
live
to
become
at
least
years
old
because
he
is
going
to
continue
to
live
as
sane
a
life
as
he
has
in
the
past

many
years
ago
his
old

white

told
him
that

date
of
his
birth
the
patarolers
according
to
uncle
rias
were
always
quite
active
in
days
the
regular
patrol
consisted
of
six
men
who
rode
nightly
different
planters
and
overseers
taking
turns
about
to
do
patrol
duty
in
each
militia
district
in
the
county
all
slaves
were
required
to
procure

from

owners

overseers
before
they
could
go
visiting
or
leave
their
home
premises
if
the
patarolers
caught
a
nigger
without
a

they
whipped
him
and
sent
him
home
sometimes
however
if
the
nigger
did
run
and
told

he
was

that

went

whether

the

off

when

something
had
to

many
of
the
body
slaves
had
wives

living
on
other
plantations
and
belonging
to
other
planters
as
a
courtesy
to
the
principals
of
such

alliances
their

furnished
the

permitting

frequently

would

to

twelve

eight
of

were
big

niggers
and
older

the

accorded

unusual

according
to

body
who
voices
the
sentiment
of
the
great
majority
of
aged
negroes
is
that
or
everything
which
one
does
and
says
not
in
the
name
of
the
master
the
holy
command
whatever
ye
do
do
it
in
my
name
is
subjected
to
some
very
unorthodox
interpretations
by
many
members
of
the
colored
race
indeed
by
their
peculiar
interpretation
of
this
command
it
is
established
that
two
clean
sheets
ca
smut
which
means
that
a
devout
man
and
woman
may
indulge
in
the
primal
passion
without
committing
sin
the
old
man
rather
boasts
of
the
fact
that
he
received
a
number
of
whippings
when
a
slave
says
he
now
knows
that
he
deserved
them

he
knew
as
a

were
quite
a
few
whom
the
negroes
looked
up
to
respected
and
feared
as
witches
wizzards
and
these
either
brought
their
learnin
with

absorbed
it
from
their

these

james
nodded
his
gray
head
with
a
wise
look
in
his
bright
eyes
when
you
hear
a
nigger
singin
sad
songs
hit
jus
kazen
he
ca
stop
what
he
is
doin
long
enough
to
go
to
sleep
the
laughter
that
greeted
this
sally
brought
an
answering
grin
to
the
wrinkled
old
face
asked
about
marriage
customs
james
said
folkses
didn
make
no
big
over
weddings
like
they
do
now
when
slaves
got
married
they
jus
laid
down
the
broom
on

jined
hands
and
jumped
over
the

fetch
mistess
down

slave
quarters

effen
the

they
the

old
slave
story
della
briscoe
macon
georgia
by
adella
dixon
hw
colored
jul
della
briscoe
now
living
in
macon
is
a
former
slave
of
david
ross
who
owned
a
large
plantation
in
putnam
county
della
when
a
very
tiny
child
was
carried
there
with
her
father
and
mother
sam
and
mary
ross
soon
after
their
arrival
the
mother
was
sent
to
work
at
the
big
house
in
eatonton
this
arrangement
left
della
her
brother
and
sister
to
the
care
of
their
grandmother
who
really
posed
as
their
mother
the
children
grew
up
under
the
impression
that
their
mother
was
an
older
sister
and
did
not
know
the
truth
until
just
after
the
close
of
the
civil
war
when
the
mother
became
seriously
ill
and
called
the
children
to
her
bedside
to
tell
them
goodbye
david
ross
had
a
large
family
and
was
considered
the
richest
planter
in
the
county
nearly
every
type
of
soil
was
found
on
his
vast
estate
composed
of
hilly
sections
as
well
as
acres
of
lowlands
the
highway
entering
eatonton
divided
the
plantation
and
down
this
road
every
friday
della
father
drove
the
wagon
to
town
with
a
supply
of
fresh
butter
for
ross
thirty
head
of
cows
supplied
enough
milk
to
furnish
the
city
dwellers
with
butter
refrigeration
was
practically
unknown
so
a
well
was
used
to
keep
the
butter
fresh
this
cool
well
was
eighty
feet
deep
and
passed
through
a
layer
of
solid
rock
a
rope
ladder
was
suspended
from
the
mouth
of
the
well
to
the
place
where
the
butter
was
lowered
for
preservation
for
safety
and
to
shield
it
from
the
sun
reeds
were
planted
all
around
the
well
and
as
they
grew
very
tall
a
stranger
would
not
suspect
a
well
being
there
in
addition
to
marketing
della
father
trapped
beavers
which
were
plentiful
in
the
swampy
part
of
the
plantation
bordering
the
oconee
selling
their
pelts
to
traders
in
the
nearby
towns
of
augusta
and
savannah
where
ross
also
marketed
his
cotton
and
large
quantities
of
corn
oxen
instead
of
mules
were
used
to
make
the
trips
to
market
and
return
each
trip
consuming
six
or
seven
days
the
young
children
were
assigned
small
tasks
such
as
piling
brush
in
new
grounds
carrying
water
to
field
hands
and
driving
the
calves
to
pasture
punishment
was
administered
though
not
as
often
as
on
some
plantations
the
little
girl
della
was
whipped
only
once
for
breaking
up
a
turkey
nest
she
had
found
several
were
accused
of
this
and
because
the
master
could
not
find
the
guilty
party
he
whipped
each
of
the
children
crime
was
practically
unknown
and
ross
slaves
never
heard
of
a
jail
until
they
were
freed
men
were
sometimes
placed
in
bucks
which
meant
they
were
laid
across
blocks
with
their
hands
and
feet
securely
tied
an
iron
bar
was
run
between
the
blocks
to
prevent
any
movement
then
after
being
stripped
they
were
whipped
della
said
that
she
knew
of
but
one
case
of
this
type
of
punishment
being
administered
a
ross
slave
sickness
was
negligible
childbirth
being
practically
the
only
form
of
a
negro
woman
coming
down
as
a
precaution
against
disease
a
tonic
was
given
each
slave
every
spring
three
were
also
every
spring
taken
from
the
field
each
day
until
every
one
had
been
given
a
dose
of
calomel
and
salts
ross
once
bought
two
slaves
who
became
ill
with
smallpox
soon
after
their
arrival
they
were
isolated
in
a
small
house
located
in
the
center
of
a
field
while
one
other
slave
was
sent
there
to
nurse
them
all
three
were
burned
to
death
when
their
hut
was
destroyed
by
fire
in
case
of
death
even
on
a
neighboring
place
all
work
was
suspended
until
the
dead
was
buried
sunday
the
only
day
of
rest
was
often
spent
in
attending
religious
services
and
because
these
were
irregularly
held
brush
arbor
meetings
were
common
this
arbor
was
constructed
of
a
brush
roof
supported
by
posts
and
crude
joists
the
seats
were
usually
made
of
small
saplings
nailed
to
short
stumps
religion
was
greatly
stressed
and
every
child
was
christened
shortly
after
its
birth
an
adult
who
desired
to
join
the
church
went
first
to
the
master
to
obtain
his
permission
he
was
then
sent
to
the
home
of
a
minister
who
lived
a
short
distance
away
at
a
place
called
flat
rock
here
his
confession
was
made
and
at
the
next
regular
service
he
was
formally
received
into
the
church
courtships
were
brief
the
old
man
who
was
past
the
age
for
work
and
only
had
to
watch
what
went
on
at
the
quarters
was
usually
the
first
to
notice
a
budding
friendship
which
he
reported
to
the
master
the
couple
was
then
questioned
and
if
they
consented
were
married
without
the
benefit
of
clergy
food
was
distributed
on
monday
night
and
for
each
adult
slave
the
following
staple
products
were
allowed
weekly
ration
on
sunday
lbs
meat
one
qt
syrup
pk
of
meal
one
gal
flour
gal
shorts
one
cup
lard
vegetables
milk
could
be
obtained
at
the
big
house
but
fresh
meat
and
chickens
were
never
given
the
desire
for
these
delicacies
often
overcame
the
slaves
better
natures
and
some
frequently
went
night
foraging
for
small
shoats
and
chickens
the
old
man
kept
account
of
the
increase
or
decrease
in
live
stock
and
poultry
and
reported
anything
missing
each
day
when
suspicion
fell
on
a
visitor
of
the
previous
night
this
information
was
given
to
his
master
who
then
searched
the
accused
dinner
pail
and
cabin
if
meat
was
found
in
either
the
culprit
was
turned
over
to
his
accuser
for
punishment
after
being
whipped
he
was
forbidden
for
three
months
to
visit
the
plantation
where
he
had
committed
the
theft
one
of
della
grandmother
favorite
recipes
was
made
of
dried
beef
and
wheat
the
wheat
was
brought
from
the
field
and
husked
by
hand
this
added
to
the
rapidly
boiling
beef
was
cooked
until
a
mush
resulted
which
was
then
eaten
from
wooden
bowls
with
spoons
of
the
same
material
white
plates
were
never
used
by
the
slaves
cloth
for
clothing
was
woven
on
the
place
della
grandmother
did
most
of
the
spinning
and
she
taught
her
child
to
spin
when
she
was
so
small
that
she
had
to
stand
on
a
raised
plank
to
reach
the
wheel
after
the
cloth
was
spun
it
was
dyed
with
dye
made
from
shoemake
sumac
leaves
green
walnuts
reeds
and
copperas
one
person
cut
and
others
sewed
the
dresses
for
women
were
straight
like
slips
and
the
garments
of
the
small
boys
resembled
night
shirts
if
desired
a
bias
fold
of
contrasting
colour
was
placed
at
the
waist
line
or
at
the
bottom
of
dresses
the
crudely
made
garments
were
starched
with
a
solution
of
flour
or
meal
and
water
which
was
strained
and
then
boiled
as
a
small
child
della
remembers
hearing
a
peculiar
knock
on
the
door
during
the
night
and
a
voice
which
replied
to
queries
no
one
to
hurt
you
but
keep
that
red
flannel
in
your
mouth
have
you
plenty
to
eat
do
worry
you
be
free
no
one
would
ever
tell
if
they
knew
to
whom
this
voice
belonged
just
before
the
beginning
of
the
civil
war
a
comet
appeared
which
was
so
bright
that
the
elder
people
amused
themselves
by
sitting
on
the
rail
fence
and
throwing
pins
upon
the
ground
where
the
reflection
was
cast
the
children
scrambled
madly
to
see
who
could
find
the
most
pins
during
the
early
part
of
the
war
ross
fought
with
the
confederates
leaving
his
young
son
robert
in
charge
of
his
affairs
the
young
master
was
very
fond
of
horses
and
his
favorite
horse
bill
was
trained
to
do
tricks
one
of
these
was
to
lie
down
when
tickled
on
his
flanks
the
yankees
visited
the
plantation
and
tried
to
take
this
horse
robert
who
loved
him
dearly
refused
to
dismount
and
as
they
were
about
to
shoot
the
horse
beneath
him
the
slaves
began
to
plead
they
explained
that
the
boy
was
kind
to
every
one
and
devoted
to
animals
after
which
explanation
he
was
allowed
to
keep
his
horse
the
breastworks
at
savannah
required
many
laborers
to
complete
their
construction
and
as
the
commanders
desired
to
save
the
strength
of
their
soldiers
slave
labor
was
solicited
two
slaves
from
each
nearby
plantation
were
sent
to
work
for
a
limited
number
of
days
the
round
trip
from
the
ross
plantation
required
seven
days
nearly
every
man
had
a
family
and
when
they
returned
from
these
long
trips
they
drove
to
the
quarters
and
fell
on
their
knees
to
receive
the
welcome
caresses
of
their
small
children
recreational
facilities
were
not
provided
and
slave
children
had
little
knowledge
of
how
to
play
their
two
main
amusements
were
building
frog
houses
and
sliding
down
a
steep
bank
on
a
long
board
one
day
as
they
played
up
and
down
the
highway
building
frog
houses
at
irregular
intervals
little
della
looked
up
and
saw
a
group
of
yankee
calvarymen
approaching
she
screamed
and
began
running
and
so
attracted
the
attention
of
ross
who
was
at
home
on
a
furlough
he
saw
the
men
in
time
to
find
a
hiding
place
meanwhile
the
soldiers
arrived
and
the
leader
springing
from
his
horse
snatched
della
up
and
spanked
her
soundly
for
giving
the
alarm
as
they
had
hoped
to
take
her
master
by
surprise
della
said
this
was
the
first
white
slap
she
ever
received
some
of
the
yankees
entered
the
house
tore
up
the
interior
and
threw
the
furniture
out
doors
another
group
robbed
the
smokehouse
and
smashed
so
many
barrels
of
syrup
that
it
ran
in
a
stream
through
the
yard
they
carried
much
of
the
meat
off
with
them
and
gave
the
remainder
to
the
slaves
chickens
were
caught
dressed
and
fried
on
the
spot
as
each
soldier
carried
his
own
frying
pan
and
a
piece
of
flint
rock
and
a
sponge
with
which
to
make
a
fire
the
men
were
skilled
in
dressing
fowls
and
cleaned
them
in
a
few
strokes
when
they
had
eaten
as
much
as
they
desired
a
search
for
the
corral
was
made
but
the
mules
were
so
well
hidden
that
they
were
not
able
to
find
them
della
father
hands
were
tied
behind
him
and
he
was
then
forced
to
show
them
the
hiding
place
these
fine
beasts
used
for
plowing
were
named
by
the
slaves
who
worked
them
characteristic
names
were
jule
pigeon
little
deal
vic
the
carriage
horse
streaked
leg
kicking
kid
janie
every
one
was
carried
off
this
raid
took
place
on
christmas
eve
and
the
slaves
were
frantic
as
they
had
been
told
that
yankees
were
mean
people
especially
was
sherman
so
pictured
when
sherman
had
gone
ross
came
from
his
hiding
place
in
the
cool
well
and
spoke
to
his
slaves
to
the
elder
ones
he
said
i
saw
you
give
away
my
meat
and
mules
master
we
were
afraid
we
did
want
to
do
it
but
we
were
afraid
not
to
yes
i
understand
that
you
could
not
help
yourselves
he
then
turned
to
the
children
saying
bless
all
of
you
but
to
little
della
i
owe
my
life
from
now
on
she
shall
never
be
whipped
and
she
shall
have
a
home
of
her
own
for
life
she
shook
with
laughter
as
she
said
master
thought
i
screamed
to
warn
him
and
i
was
only
frightened
true
to
his
word
after
freedom
he
gave
her
a
plot
of
land
upon
which
he
built
a
house
and
added
a
mule
buggy
cow
hogs
etc
della

there
until
after
her

she
had
to

man
he
was
for
a
number
of
years
personal
after
williams
death
during
the
uncle
george
was
sold
to
a
white
man
whose
name
he
remember
of
dadeville
alabama
with
whom
he
subsequently
spent
five
months
in
the
confederate
service
one
of
uncle
george
stories
is
to
the
effect
that
he
once
left
a
chore
he
was
doing
for
his
second
marster
wife
stepped
to
a
nearby
well
to
get
a
drink
of
water
and
impelled
by
some
strange
irresistible
power
jes
kep
on
walkin
he
run
inter
de
yankees
who
corraled
him
and
kept
him
for
three
months
still
another
story
he
tells
is
that
of
his
being
sold
after
freedom
according
to
his
version
of
this
incident
he
was
sold
along
with
two
bales
of
cotton
in
the
fall
of
either
the
cotton
being
sold
and
he
thrown
in
with
it
or
vice
versa
he
does
know
which
but
he
that
he
and
the
cotton
were
sold
together
and
very
soon
after
this
transaction
occurred
the
seller
was
clapped
in
jail
then
somebody
he
does
remember
who
gave
him
some
money
put
him
on
a
at
night
and
shipped
him
to
columbus
where
he
learned
that
he
was
a
free
man
and
has
since
remained
uncle
george
has
been
married
once
and
is
the
father
of
several
children
his
wife
however
died
years
ago
and
he
knows
nothing
of
the
whereabouts
of
his
children
does
even
know
whether
or
not
any
of
them
are
living
having
lost
all
track
kin
fokes
too
long
ago
to
tawk
about
unfortunately
uncle
george
mind
is
clouded
and
his
memory
badly
impaired
otherwise
his
life
story
would
perhaps
be
quite
interesting
for
more
than
twenty
years
he
has
been
supported
and
cared
for
by
kind
hearted
members
of
his
race
who
say
that
they
intend
to
continue
to
look
after
the
old
man

worser
and
at

sarah

claims
to

but
the
first
impression
one
receives
when
looking
at
her
is
that
of
an
old
lady
who
is
very
active
and
possessing
a
sweet
clear
voice
when
she
speaks
you
can
easily
understand
every
word
and
besides
this
each
thought
is
well
expressed
often
during
the
interview
she
would
suddenly
break
out
in
a
merry
laugh
as
if
her

thoughts
amused

the

thanked
her
for
the
interview
and
promised
to
make
another
visit
soon
interview
with
mariah
callaway
tr
a
significant
portion
of
this
interview
was
repeated
in
typescript
where
there
was
a
discrepancy
the
clearer
version
was
used
where
a
completely
different
word
was
substituted
original
refers
to
the
typewritten
page
mariah
callaway
sat
in
a
chair
opposite
the
writer
and
told
her
freely
of
the
incidents
of
slavery
as
she
remembered
them
to
a
casual
observer
it
will
come
as
a
surprise
to
know
the
woman
was
blind
she
is
quite
old
but
her
thoughts
were
clearly
and
intelligently
related
to
the
writer
callaway
was
born
in
washington
wilkes
county
georgia
probably
during
the
year
as
she
estimated
her
age
to
be
around
or
years
when
freedom
was
declared
she
does
not
remember
her
mother
and
father
as
her
mother
died
the
second
day
after
she
was
born
so
the
job
of
rearing
her
and
a
small
brother
fell
on
her
grandmother
mariah
willis
for
whom
she
was
named
callaway
stated
that
the
old
master
jim
willis
kept
every
negro
age
in
a
bible
but
after
he
died
the
bible
was
placed
upstairs
in
the
gallery
and
most
of
the
pages
were
destroyed
the
following
is
a
story
of
the
purchase
of
grandfather
as
related
by
her
my
grandfather
come
directly
from
africa
and
i
never
shall
forget
the
story
he
told
us
of
how
he
and
other
natives
were
fooled
on
board
a
ship
by
the
white
slave
traders
using
red
handkerchiefs
as
enticement
when
they
reached
america
droves
of
them
were
put
on
the
block
and
sold
to
people
all
over
the
united
states
the
master
and
mistress
of
their
plantation
were
jim
willis
and
nancy
willis
who
owned
hundreds
of
acres
of
land
and
a
large
number
of
slaves
callaway
was
unable
to
give
an
exact
number
but
stated
the
willises
were
considered
wealthy
people
on
their
plantation
were
raised
sheep
goats
mules
horses
cows
etc
cotton
corn
and
vegetables
were
also
raised
the
willis
family
was
a
large
one
consisting
of
six
children
boys
and
girls
their
home
was
a
large
frame
house
which
was
set
apart
from
the
slave
quarters
slave
homes
on
the
willis
plantation
differed
in
no
respect
from
the
usual
type
found
elsewhere
all
homes
were
simple
log
cabins
grouped
together
forming
what
is
known
as
slave
quarters
the
willis
family
as
kind
and
religious
and
saw
to
it
that
their
slaves
were
given
plenty
of
food
to
eat
every
monday
night
each
family
was
given
its
share
of
food
for
the
week
each
grown
person
was
given
a
peck
of
corn
tr
meal
on
original
page
and
three
pounds
of
meat
besides
the
vegetables
etc
on
tuesday
morning
each
family
was
given
an
ample
amount
of
real
flour
for
biscuits
many
of
the
slave
families
especially
callaway
family
were
given
the
privilege
of
earning
money
by
selling
different
products
my
grandfather
owned
a
cotton
patch
remarked
callaway
and
the
master
would
loan
him
a
mule
so
he
could
plow
it
at
night
two
boys
would
each
hold
a
light
for
him
to
work
by
he
preferred
working
at
night
to
working
on
his
holidays
my
master
had
a
friend
in
augusta
by
the
name
of
steve
heard
and
just
before
my
grandfather
got
ready
to
sell
his
cotton
the
master
would
write
heard
and
tell
him
that
he
was
sending
cotton
by
sam
and
wanted
his
sold
and
a
receipt
returned
to
him
he
also
advised
him
to
give
all
the
money
received
to
sam
when
grandfather
returned
he
would
be
loaded
down
with
sugar
cheese
tea
mackerel
etc
for
his
family
when
the
women
came
home
from
the
fields
they
had
to
spin
cuts
so
many
before
supper
and
so
many
after
supper
a
group
of
women
were
then
selected
to
weave
the
cuts
of
thread
into
cloth
dyes
were
made
from
red
shoe
berries
and
later
used
to
dye
this
cloth
different
colors
all
slaves
received
clothing
twice
a
year
spring
and
winter
jim
willis
was
known
for
his
kindness
to
his
slaves
and
saw
to
it
that
they
were
kept
supplied
with
sunday
clothes
and
shoes
as
well
as
work
clothing
a
colored
shoemaker
was
required
to
keep
the
plantation
supplied
with
shoes
and
everyone
was
given
a
pair
of
sunday
shoes
which
they
kept
shined
with
a
mixture
of
egg
white
and
soot
the
size
of
the
willis
plantation
and
the
various
crops
and
cattle
raised
required
many
different
types
of
work
there
were
the
plow
hands
the
hoe
hands
etc
each
worker
had
a
required
amount
of
work
to
complete
each
day
and
an
overseer
was
hired
by
slave
owners
to
keep
check
on
this
phase
of
the
work
we
often
waited
until
the
overseer
got
behind
a
hill
and
then
we
would
lay
down
our
hoe
and
call
on
god
to
free
us
my
grandfather
told
me
remarked
callaway
however
i
was
a
pet
in
the
willis
household
and
did
not
have
any
work
to
do
except
play
with
the
small
children
i
was
required
to
keep
their
hands
and
faces
clean
sometimes
i
brought
in
chips
to
make
the
fires
we
often
kept
so
much
noise
playing
in
the
upstairs
bedroom
that
the
master
would
call
to
us
and
ask
that
we
keep
quiet
older
women
on
the
plantation
acted
as
nurses
for
all
the
small
children
and
babies
while
their
parents
worked
in
the
fields
the
mistress
would
keep
a
sharp
eye
on
the
children
also
to
see
that
they
were
well
cared
for
a
slave
life
was
very
valuable
to
their
owners
punishment
was
seldom
necessary
on
the
willis
plantation
as
the
master
and
mistress
did
everything
possible
to
make
their
slaves
happy
and
to
a
certain
extent
indulged
them
they
were
given
whisky
liberally
from
their
master
still
and
other
choice
food
on
special
occasions
i
remember
once
remarked
callaway
my
aunt
rachel
burned
the
biscuits
and
the
young
master
said
to
her
rachel
you
nursed
me
and
i
promised
not
to
ever
whip
you
so
do
worry
about
burning
the
bread
my
mistress
was
very
fond
of
me
too
and
gave
me
some
of
everything
that
she
gave
her
own
children
tea
cakes
apples
etc
she
often
told
me
that
she
was
my
mother
and
was
supposed
to
look
after
me
in
spite
of
the
kindness
of
the
willis
family
there
were
some
slaves
who
were
unruly
so
the
master
built
a
house
off
to
itself
and
called
it
the
willis
jail
here
he
would
keep
those
whom
he
had
to
punish
i
have
known
some
slaves
to
run
away
on
other
plantations
and
the
hounds
would
bite
plugs
out
of
their
legs
the
willis
family
did
not
object
to
girls
and
boys
courting
there
were
large
trees
and
often
in
the
evenings
the
boys
from
other
plantations
would
come
over
to
see
the
girls
on
the
willis
plantation
they
would
stand
in
groups
around
the
trees
laughing
and
talking
if
the
courtship
reached
the
point
of
marriage
a
real
marriage
ceremony
was
performed
from
the
bible
and
the
man
was
given
a
pass
to
visit
his
wife
weekly
following
a
marriage
a
frolic
took
place
and
the
mistress
saw
to
it
that
everyone
was
served
nice
foods
for
the
occasion
frolics
were
common
occurrences
on
the
willis
plantation
also
quilting
parties
good
foods
consisting
of
pies
cakes
chicken
brandied
peaches
etc
dancing
was
always
to
be
expected
by
anyone
attending
them
remarked
callaway
our
master
always
kept
two
to
three
hundred
gallons
of
whisky
and
did
mind
his
slaves
drinking
i
can
remember
my
master
taking
his
sweetened
dram
every
morning
and
often
he
gave
me
some
in
a
tumbler
on
christmas
day
big
dinners
were
given
for
all
of
the
slaves
and
a
few
ate
from
the
family
table
after
they
had
finished
their
dinner
medical
care
was
promptly
given
a
slave
when
he
became
special
care
was
always
given
them
for
the
willis
family
had
a
personal
interest
in
their
slaves
on
one
occasion
remarked
calloway
the
scarlet
fever
broke
out
among
the
slaves
and
to
protect
the
well
ones
it
became
necessary
to
build
houses
in
a
field
for
those
who
were
sick
this
little
settlement
later
became
know
as
shant
field
food
was
carried
to
a
hill
and
left
so
that
the
sick
persons
could
get
it
without
coming
in
contact
with
the
others
to
kill
the
fever
sticks
of
fat
pine
were
dipped
in
tar
and
set
on
fire
and
then
placed
all
over
the
field
religion
played
as
important
part
in
the
lives
of
the
slaves
and
such
tr
much
importance
was
attached
to
their
prayer
meetings
there
were
no
churches
provided
and
occasionally
they
attended
the
white
churches
but
more
often
they
held
their
prayer
meetings
in
their
own
cabins
prayers
and
singing
was
in
a
moaning
fashion
and
you
often
heard
this
and
nothing
more
on
sunday
afternoons
everyone
found
a
seat
around
the
mulberry
tree
and
the
young
mistress
would
conduct
sunday
school
concerning
the
civil
war
callaway
related
the
following
story
when
the
war
broke
out
my
mistress
home
became
a
sewing
center
and
deifferent
women
in
the
neighborhood
would
come
there
every
day
to
make
clothes
for
the
soldiers
on
each
bed
was
placed
the
vests
coats
shirts
pants
and
caps
one
group
did
all
the
cutting
one
the
stitching
and
one
the
fitting
many
women
cried
while
they
served
tr
sewed
because
their
husbands
and
sons
had
to
go
to
the
war
one
day
the
yanks
came
to
our
plantation
and
took
all
of
the
best
horses
in
one
of
their
wagons
were
bales
of
money
which
they
had
taken
money
then
was
blue
in
color
of
course
there
was
silver
and
gold
after
taking
the
horses
they
drank
as
much
whisky
as
they
could
hold
and
then
filled
their
canteens
the
rest
of
the
whisky
they
filled
with
spit
the
master
did
interfere
for
fear
of
the
long
guns
which
they
carried
after
the
war
some
of
the
slaves
left
the
plantation
to
seek
their
fortune
others
remained
renting
land
from
the
willis
family
or
working
with
them
on
a
share
crop
basis
as
a
conclusion
callaway
remarked
my
folks
were
good
and
i
know
hw
they
in
heaven
callaway
is
deeply
religious
and
all
during
the
interview
would
constantly
drift
to
the
subject
of
religion
she
is
well
cared
for
by
her

no
i
was
married
till
after
freedom
i
was
married
right
here
in
by
wharton
the

i
lived
and
worked
here

old
slave
story
may
telfair
county
was
the
home
of
some
colored
people
who
never
were
slaves
but
hired
their
services
for
wages
just
as
the
race
does
today
berry
clay
half
indian
half
white
was
the
son
of
fitema
bob
britt
a
full
blood
indian
who
died
shortly
after
his
son
birth
his
mother
later
married
william
clay
whose
name
was
taken
by
the
children
as
well
as
the
mother
the
family
then
moved
to
macon
clay
next
tr
the
scratched
out
oldest
of
five
children
was
years
old
on
august
and
while
he
was
never
a
slave
remembers
many
incidents
that
took
place
then
not
many
years
after
his
mother
remarried
she
became
very
ill
and
he
recalls
being
lifted
by
his
to
kiss
her
good
bye
as
she
lay
dying
after
her
death
the
family
continued
to
live
in
south
macon
where
the
father
was
employed
as
overseer
for
a
crew
at
the
railroad
yard
this
position
often
called
for
the
punishment
of
slaves
but
he
was
too
loyal
to
his
color
to
assist
in
making
their
lives
more
unhappy
his
method
of
carrying
out
orders
and
yet
keeping
a
clear
conscience
was
unique
the
slave
was
taken
to
the
woods
where
he
was
supposedly
laid
upon
a
log
and
severely
beaten
actually
he
was
made
to
stand
to
one
side
and
to
emit
loud
cries
which
were
accompanied
by
hard
blows
on
the
log
the
continuation
of
the
two
sounds
gave
any
listener
the
impression
that
some
one
was
severely
beaten
it
is
said
that
clay
the
father
wore
out
several
huge

he
was
employed
was
a
macon
citizen
who
served
as
president
of
the
central
of
georgia
railroad
for
many
years
a
monument
on
mulberry
street
nearly
opposite
the
post
office
is
a
constant
reminder
of
the
esteem
in
which
he
was
held
his
plantation
was
a
huge
one
extending
from
the
railroad
yard
as
far
as
the
present
site
of
mercer
university
a
day
of
rest
was
given
the
slaves
about
once
every
three
months
in
addition
to
the
regular
holidays
which
are
observed
today
on
holidays
frolics
at
which
square
dances
were
the
chief
form
of
entertainment
by
the
music
of
a
banjo
or
fiddle
were
enjoyed
ring
games
were
played
by
the
children
the
refreshments
usually
consisted
of
ash
cakes
and
barbecue
the
ash
cake
was
made
by
wrapping
corn
pones
in
oak
leaves
and
burying
the
whole
in
hot
ashes
when
the
leaves
dried
the
cake
was
usually
done
and
was
carefully
moved
to
prevent
its
becoming
soiled

a
skillful

could
produce

the
membership
of
the
local
church
was
composed
of
slaves
from
several
plantations
it
was
an
old
colored
church
with
a
white
minister
who
preached
the
usual
doctrine
of
the
duty
of
a
slave
to
his
master
the
form
of
service
was
the
same
as
that
of
the
white
church
one
unusual
feature
of
the
plantation
was
its
sunday
school
for
the
negro
children
courtships
were
very
brief
for
as
soon
as
a
man
or
woman
began
to
manifest
interest
in
the
opposite
sex
the
master
busied
himself
to
select
a
wife
or
husband
and
only
in
rare
cases
was
the
desire
of
the
individual
considered
when
the
selection
was
made
the
master
read
the
ceremony
and
gave
the
couple
a
home
he
always
requested
or
rather
demanded
that
they
be
fruitful
a
barren
woman
was
separated
from
her
husband
and
usually
sold
very
little
money
was
handled
by
these
people
the
carriage
drivers
were
more
fortunate
than
the
regular
workers
for
they
smuggled
things
to
town
when
they
drove
the
master
and
mistress
and
sold
them
while
the
family
shopped
or
went
visiting
at
rare
intervals
the
field
hands
were
able
to
earn
small
sums
of
money
in
this
manner
food
was
provided
by
the
owners
and
all
families
cooked
for
themselves
whether
they
were
many
or
one
the
weekly
allotments
of
meal
meat
were
supplemented
through
the
use
of
vegetables
which
could
always
be
obtained
from
the
fields
on
special
days
chicken
or
beef
was
given
and
each
one
had
a
sufficient
amount
for
his
needs
hunting
and
fishing
were
recreations
in
which
the
slaves
were
not
allowed
to
participate
although
they
frequently
went
on
secret
excursions
of
this
nature
all
food
stuff
as
well
as
cloth
for
garments
was
produced
at
home
clay
is
very
superstitious
still
believing
in
most
of
the
signs
commonly
believed
in
those
days
because
he
has
watched
them
and
found
that
they
are
true
he
stated
that
the
screeching
of
the
owl
may
be
stopped
by
placing
a
poker
in
the
fire
and
allowing
it
to
remain
until
it
becomes
red
hot
the
owl
will
then
leave
but
death
will
invariably
follow
its
visit
the
attitudes
of
the
two
races
in
the
south
regarding
the
war
were
directly
opposite
the
whites
beheld
it
as
something
horrible
and
dreaded
the
losses
that
would
necessarily
be
theirs
sons
and
fathers
had
property
to
be
considered
but
they
were
generous
in
their
contributions
to
the
soldiers
on
the
other
hand
the
slaves
rejoiced
as
they
looked
forward
to
their
freedom
when
the
war
was
over
there
were
however
a
few
who
were
devoted
to
their
masters
to
the
extent
that
they
fought
in
their
stead
in
the
confederate
army
others
remained
at
home
and
skillfully
ran
the
plantation
and
protected
the
women
and
children
until
the
end
of
the
war
when
sherman
made
his
famous
march
to
sea
one
phalanx
of
his
army
wrought
its
destruction
between
this
city
and
griswoldville
a
gun
factory
and
government
shoe
factory
were
completely
destroyed
although
the
citizens
gave
the
invaders
everything
they
thought
they
desired
the
rest
was
destroyed
in
most
instances
they
tried
to
ascertain
the
attitudes
of
the
land
owners
toward
his
servants
and
when
for
any
reason
they
presumed
that
one
was
cruel
their
vengeance
was
expressed
through
the
absolute
destruction
of
his
property
in
nearly
every
instance
smoke
houses
were
raided
and
the
contents
either
destroyed
or
given
away
barrels
of
syrup
flowing
through
the
yard
was
a
common
sight
at
the
end
of
the
war
the
south
was
placed
under
military
rule
the
presence
of
the
yankee
guardsmen
had
a
psychological
effect
upon
the
southerners
and
they
were
very
humble
before
the
terrors
of
the
war
had
subsided
a
new
menace
sprang
up
the
klu
klux
klan
while
its
energy
was
usually
directed
against
a
white
man
was
sometimes
a
victim
one
such
occasion
was
recalled
by
clay
the
group
planned
to
visit
a
man
who
for
some
reason
became
suspicious
and
prepared
to
outwit
them
if
they
came
he
heated
a
huge
pot
of
water
and
when
a
part
of
his
door
was
crashed
in
he
reached
through
the
opening
and
poured
gourds
of
boiling
water
upon
his
assailants
they
retreated
hw
and
while
they
were
away
he
made
his
way
to
atlanta
another
group
which
began
its
operations
shortly
after
the
close
of
the
war
was
a
military
clan
organized
for
the
purpose
of
giving
the
a
knowledge
of
drilling
and
war
tactics
an
order
to
disband
was
received
from
the
black
horse
calvary
by
the
leader
of
the
group
his
life
was
threatened
when
he
failed
to
obey
so
he
prepared
for
a
surprise
visit
he
fortified
his
house
with
men
on
the
inside
and
the
same
number
outside
when
the
approaching
calvarymen
reached
a
certain
point
the
fifty
hidden
men
fired
at
the
same
time
seven
members
of
the
band
were
killed
and
many
others
wounded
there
was
no
further
interference
from
this
group
clay
and
his
father
ran
a
grocery
store
just
after
emancipation
he
did
not
like
this
type
of
work
and
apprenticed
himself
to
a
painter
to
learn
the
trade
he
is
still
considered
an
excellent
painter
though
he
does
not
receive
much
work
he
has
always
taken
care
of
himself
and
never
ran
about
at
night
he
boasts
that
his
associates
never
included
a
dancing
woman
as
he
has
used
tobacco
for
years
he
does
not
consider
it
a
menace
to
health
but
states
that
worry
will
kill
anyone
and
the
man
who
wants
to
live
a
long
time
must
form
the
habit
of
not
worrying
his
indian
blood
the
high
cheek
bones
red
skin
and
straight
black
hair
now
tinged
with
grey
make
this
unmistakable
has
probably
played
a
large

his
father
was
born
in
richmond

his
mother
in
warren
county
when
the
emancipation
proclamation
was
signed
he
the
eldest
child
in
a
large
family
was
in
his
early
teens
this
group
lived
on
the
place
owned
by
bob
cody
hw
whose
family
was
a
group
of
ardent
believers
in
the
hardshell
baptist
faith
so
firm
was
their
faith
that
a
church
of
this
denomination
was
provided
for
the
slaves
and
each
one
required
to
become
a
member
a
white
minister
invariably
preached
the
then
worn
out
doctrine
of
a
slave
duty
to
his
master
the
reward
of
faithfulness
and
the
usual
admonition
against
stealing
the
members
of
this
church
were
required
to
fast
on
one
day
of
the
week
the
fast
lasting
all
day
until
seven
in
the
evening
the
small
boys
both
white
and
colored
resenting
the
abstinence
from
food
usually
secured
a
reserve
supply
which
was
cached
during
the
week
and
secretly
enjoyed
on
fast
day
fish
were
plentiful
in
all
the
streams
and
they
sometimes
sneaked
away
to
the
river
and
after
enjoying
the
sport
cooked
their
catch
on
the
banks
of
the
stream
groups
of
ministers
to
then
traveled
from
one
plantation
to
another
spreading
the
gospel
and
were
entertained
as
they
traveled
on
one
occasion
the
group
arrived
at
the
cody
estate
on
fast
day
the
boys
having
been
on
one
of
their
secret
fishing
trips
had
caught
so
many
perch
that
they
were
not
able
to
consume
them
on
the
banks
so
had
smuggled
them
to
the
kitchen
coaxed
the
cook
to
promise
to
prepare
them
and
had
also
sworn
her
to
absolute
secrecy
regarding
their
origin
although
the
kitchen
was
not
directly
connected
with
the
big
house
the
guests
soon
detected
the
aroma
of
fresh
fish
and
requested
that
they
be
allowed
to
partake
of
this
delicacy
when
the
boys
as
well
as
the
servants
heard
this
they
became
panicky
for
they
feared
the
wrath
of
the
master
but
the
catch
was
so
heartily
relished
that
instead
of
the
expected
punishment
they
were
commended
and
allowed
to
fish
on
the
next
day
of
fasting
as
was
characteristic
of
many
others
the
planter
home
was
near
the
center
of
a
vast
estate
and
in
this
instance
had
a
tall
lookout
on
the
roof
from
which
the
watchman
might
see
for
miles
around
the
quarters
were
nearby
and
the
children
who
played
in
the
large
yard
were
closely
watched
as
they
were
often
stolen
by
speculators
and
later
sold
at
auctions
far
away
the
land
was
divided
into
many
fields
each
of
which
was
used
to
cultivate
a
particular
product
each
field
had
its
special
crew

hours

a
large
number
of
horses
and
more
than
two
hundred
head
of
cattle
had
to
be
fed
by
sunrise
when
they
were
to
be
turned
into
the
pastures
or
driven
to
the
field
to
begin
the
day

as

began
other
workers
were
hoe
hands
additional
foremen
cooks
weavers
spinners
seamstresses
tailors
shoemakers
etc
as
everything
used
was
grown
and
made
on
the
estate
there
was
plenty
of
work
for
all
and
in
many
instances
hw
slaves
learned
trades
which
they
liked
and
which
furnished
a
livelihood
when
they
were
set
free
hw
when
he
entered
his
teens
cody
first
duties
began
hw
as
a
plowhand
who
broke
newground
as
all
of
this
land
was
to
be
plowed
a
lack
of
skill
in
making
straight
furrows
did
not
matter
so
beginners
were
preferably
used
shortly
after
he
began
plowing
he
was
made
foreman
of
one
of
the
groups
thus
encouraged
by
his
master
faith
in
his
ability
to
do
a
man
work
he
assumed
a
grown
up
attitude
under
the
stimulus
of
his
new
responsibilities
and
was
married
shortly
after
at
this
time
marriages
resulted
from
brief
courtships
after
the
consent
of
the
girl
was
obtained
it
was
necessary
to
seek
permission
from
the
master
whether
she
lived
on
the
same
or
an
adjoining
plantation
in
the
latter
case
the
marriage
rites
were
performed
by
her
master
the
minister
was
not
used
in
most
instances
the
ceremony
hw
being
read
from
a
testament
by
the
owner
of
the
bride
marriages
were
nearly
always
performed
out
of
doors
in
the
late
afternoon
the
bride
wedding
dress
was
fashioned
of
cloth
made
on
the
plantation
from
a
pattern
of
her
own
designing
attendants
at
marriages
were
rare
after
the
ceremony
the
guests
danced
far
into
the
night
by
music
from
the
fiddle
and
banjo
refreshments
consisting
of
ginger
cakes
barbecue
were
served
such
a
couple
belonging
to
two
different
masters
did
not
keep
house
the
hw
husband
was
allowed
to
visit
his
wife
on
wednesday
night
and
saturday
when
he
might
remain
through
sunday
all
marriage
unions
were
permanent
and
a
barren
wife
was
considered
the
only
real
cause
for
separation
church
services
for
this
group
were
held
jointly
with
the
white
members
the
two
audiences
being
separated
by
a
partition
gradually
the
colored
members
became
dissatisfied
with
this
type
of
service
and
withdrew
to
form
a
separate
church
the
desire
for
independence
in
worship
must
necessarily
have
been
strong
to
endure
the
inconveniences
of
the
brush
arbor
churches
that
they
resorted
to
as
a
beginning
several
trees
were
felled
and
the
brush
and
forked
branches
separated
four
heavy
branches
with
forks
formed
the
framework
straight
poles
were
laid
across
these
to
form
a
crude
imitation
of
beams
and
the
other
framework
of
a
building
the
top
and
sides
were
formed
of
brush
which
was
thickly
placed
so
that
it
formed
a
solid
wall
a
hole
left
in
one
side
formed
a
doorway
from
which
beaten
paths
extended
in
all
directions
seats
made
from
slabs
obtained
at
local
sawmills
completed
the
furnishing
in
inclement
weather
it
was
not
possible
to
conduct
services
here
but
occasionally
showers
came
in
the
midst
of
the
service
and
the
audience
calmly
hoisted
umbrellas
or
papers
and
with
such
scant
protection
the
worship
continued
sunday
afternoons
were
quietly
spent
visiting
being
the
only
means
of
recreation
one
of
the
favorite
stay
at
home
pastimes
was
the
inspection
of
heads
the
pediculous
condition
made
frequent
treatment
necessary
for
comfort
the
young
white
men
liked
to
visit
the
quarters
and
have
the
slaves
search
their
heads
they
would
stretch
full
length
upon
the
cabin
floors
and
rest
their
heads
upon
a
pillow
usually
they
offered
a
gift
of
some
sort
if
many
of
the
tiny
parasites
were
destroyed
so
the
clever
picker
who
found
a
barren
head
simply
reached
into
his
own
and
produced
a
goodly
number
there
existed
on
this
plantation
an
antagonistic
feeling
toward
children
born
of
slave
parents
with
a
beautiful
suit
of
hair
and
this
type
of
hair
was
kept
cropped
very
short
gossip
stealing
etc
was
not
tolerated
no
one
was
ever
encouraged
to
tattle
on
another
locks
were
never
used
on
any
of
the
cabin
doors
or
on
the
smokehouse
food
was
there
in
abundance
and
each
person
was
free
to
replenish
his
supply
as
necessary
money
was
more
or
less
a
novelty
as
it
was
only
given
in
pieces
at
christmas
time
as
food
clothing
and
shelter
were
furnished
the
absence
was
not
particularly
painful
connected
with
nearly
every
home
were
those
persons
who
lived
in
the
woods
in
preference
to
doing
the
labor
necessary
to
remain
at
their
home
each
usually
had
a
scythe
and
a
bulldog
for
protection
as
food
became
scarce
they
sneaked
to
the
quarters
in
the
still
of
the
night
and
coaxed
some
friend
to
get
food
for
them
from
the
smokehouse
their
supply
obtained
they
would
leave
again
this
was
not
considered
stealing
medical
care
was
also
free
excellent
physicians
were
maintained
it
was
not
considered
necessary
to
call
a
physician
until
home
remedies
usually
teas
made
of
roots
had
had
no
effect
women
in
childbirth
were
cared
for
by
grannies
old
women
whose
knowledge
was
broad
by
experience
acted
as
practical
nurses
several
cooks
were
regularly
maintained
some
cooked
for
the
men
who
had
no
families
others
for
the
members
of
the
big
house
and
guests
the
menus
varied
little
from
day
to
day
a
diet
of
bread
called
shortening
bread
vegetables
and
smoked
meat
were
usually
consumed
buttermilk
was
always
plentiful
on
sundays
seconds
flour
were
added
to
the
list
and
butter
accompanied
this
chickens
fresh
meat
were
holiday
items
and
were
seldom
enjoyed
at
any
other
time
not
only
were
the
slaves
required
to
work
but
the
young
men
of
the
big
house
also
had
their
duties
in
the
summer
they
went
fishing
while
this
sport
was
enjoyed
it
was
done
on
an
extremely
large
scale
in
order
that
everyone
should
have
an
adequate
supply
of
fish
the
streams
abounded
in
all
kinds
of
fish
and
nets
were
used
to
obtain
large
quantities
necessary
in
winter
hunting
was
engaged
in
for
this
same
purpose
rabbits
squirrels
were
the
usual
game
but
in
addition
the
trapping
of
wild
hogs
was
frequently
indulged
in
the
woods
contained
many
of
these
animals
which
were
exceptionally
vicious
the
hunters
however
trapped
them
in
much
the
same
way
that
rabbits
are
now
caught
without
injury
to
the
flesh
tr
the
meat
more
delicious
marked
out
deer
were
also
plentiful
and
venison
enjoyed
during
its
season
horned
snakes
were
the
greatest
impediments
to
more
abundant
hunting
knowledge
of
the
war
was
kept
from
the
slaves
until
long
after
its
beginning
most
of
them
had
no
idea
what
war
meant
and
any
news
that
might
have
been
spread
fell
on
deaf
ears
gradually
this
knowledge
was
imparted
by
yankee
peddlers
who
came
to
the
plantation
to
sell
etc
when
the
master
discovered
how
this
information
was
being
given
out
these
peddlers
were
forbidden
to
go
near
the
quarters
this
rule
was
strictly
enforced
eventually
the
confederate
soldiers
on
their
way
to
and
from
camp
began
to
stop
at
the
house
food
and
everything
available
was
given
to
them
three
of
cody
sons
were
killed
in
battle
as
the
northern
soldiers
did
not
come
near
the
home
the
loss
of
property
was
practically
negligible
tr
six
cents
being
all
marked
out
when
the
emancipation
proclamation
was
signed
the
slaves
were
called
to
the
big
house
in
a
group
to
receive
the
news
that
they
were
free
both
old
and
young
danced
and
cheered
when
this
information
was
given
out
many
of
the
families
remained
there
for
a
year
or
two
until
they
were
able
to
find
desirable
locations
elsewhere
cody
attributes
his
ability
to
reach
a
ripe
old
age
to
the
excellent
care
he
took
of
himself
in
his
youth
he
has
used
tobacco
since
he
was
a
small
boy
and
does
not
feel
that
it
affects
his
health
distilled
liquor
was
plentiful
in

sarah
hall
with
the
thermometer
registering
degrees
in
the
shade
on
a
particularly
humid
july
day
the
visitor
trudged
up
one
steep
rocky
alley
and
down
another
hesitantly
negotiated
shaky
little
bridges
over
several
ravines
scrambled
out
of
a
ditch
and
finally
arrived
at
the
address
of
mary
colbert
it
was
the
noon
hour
a
negro
man
had
tied
his
mule
under
an
apple
tree
in
one
corner
of
mary
yard
the
animal
was
peacefully
munching
hay
while
his
master
enjoyed
lunch
from
a
battered
tin
bucket
asked
if
mary
was
at
home
the
man
replied
yessum
call
her
at
de
door
a
luxuriant
virginia
creeper
shaded
the
front
porch
of
mary
frame
house
where
a
rap
on
the
front
door
brought
the
response
here
i
am
honey
come
right
on
through
the
house
to
the
back
porch
the
aged
mulatto
woman
was
hanging
out
clothes
on
a
line
suspended
between
two
peach
trees
to
the
inquiry
for
mary
she
answered
yes
honey
this
is
mary
they
say
i
am
old
childish
and
hellish
anyway
this
is
mary
dear
let
go
in
my
parlor
she
suggested
in
a
cultured
voice
i
would
dare
go
out
on
the
front
porch
wearing
this
dirty
dress
it
simply
is
my
way
of
living
mary
is
about
five
feet
tall
and
wears
her
straight
hair
in
a
neat
knot
low
on
the
back
of
her
head
the
sparkle
in
her
bright
brown
eyes
bespeaks
a
more
youthful
spirit
than
her
wrinkled
and
almost
white
face
would
indicate
she
was
wearing
a
soiled
print
dress
brown
cotton
hose
and
black
shoes
in
remarkably
good
english
for
one
of
her
race
she
told
that
her
daughter
family
lives
with
her
so
that
i
wo
be
right
by
myself
then
she
began
her
story
honey
what
is
it
you
want
me
to
tell
you
where
was
i
born
oh
my
child
i
was
born
right
here
in
dear
old
hilly
athens
yes
that
where
i
was
born
polly
crawford
was
my
mother
and
she
belonged
to
major
william
crawford
before
he
gave
her
to
his
son
marse
john
crawford
now
about
my
father
that
is
the
dream
he
died
when
i
was
just
a
little
child
they
said
he
was
sandy
thomas
and
that
he
was
owned
by
marster
obadiah
thomas
who
lived
in
oglethorpe
county
all
i
can
remember
about
my
grandparents
is
this
when
i
found
my
grandma
hannah
crawford
she
was
living
on
major
crawford
plantation
where
crawford
georgia
is
now
grandma
was
a
little
bitty
woman
so
little
that
she
wore
a
number
one
shoe
she
was
brought
here
from
virginia
to
be
a
field
hand
but
she
was
smart
as
a
whip
and
lived
to
be
years
old
i
used
to
tell
my
mother
that
i
wished
i
was
named
hannah
for
her
and
so
mother
called
me
mary
hannah
i
ca
bring
my
grandfather
to
mind
very
clearly
i
do
remember
that
my
mother
took
me
to
penfield
to
see
him
and
told
me
if
i
was
a
good
little
girl
he
would
surely
whip
me
they
called
him
campfire
because
he
had
such
a
fiery
temper
for
a
living
after
he
got
to
be
an
old
man
he
made
cheers
chairs
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
do
know
who
he
belonged
to
because
major
crawford
sold
him
before
i
was
born
there
were
five
of
us
children
nat
solomon
susannah
sarah
and
myself
marse
john
gave
solomon
to
his
daughter
miss
fannie
when
she
married
marse
william
gerdine
susannah
belonged
to
miss
rosa
golden
and
sarah
and
i
belonged
to
the
other
miss
fannie
she
was
marse
sister
nat
was
marse
john
house
boy
and
our
mother
was
his
cook
we
children
just
played
around
the
yard
until
we
were
large
enough
to
work
yes
my
dear
i
was
born
in
marse
john
back
yard
he
lived
in
a
frame
house
on
dougherty
street
back
of
scudder
school
the
two
slave
houses
and
the
kitchen
were
set
off
from
the
house
a
little
piece
out
in
the
yard
it
was
the
style
then
to
have
the
kitchen
built
separate
from
the
dwelling
house
lord
bless
your
life
honey
we
did
live
in
log
cabins
as
you
call
them
there
were
two
slave
houses
the
one
aggie
lived
in
was
the
other
one
had
just
one
story
and
they
were
both
weatherboarded
like
marse
john
own
house
the
grown
folks
slept
on
beds
made
with
tall
oak
posts
there
were
no
metal
springs
then
and
the
beds
were
corded
instead
the
mattress
ticks
were
made
with
plain
and
striped
material
and
pillows
were
filled
with
cotton
we
children
slept
on
trundle
beds
which
were
pushed
up
under
the
big
beds
in
the
daytime
and
pulled
out
for
us
to
sleep
on
at
night
no
ma
there
was
never
any
money
given
to
me
in
slavery
time
remember
dear
when
the
yankees
came
through
here
i
was
only
ten
years
old
misses
fannie
and
ann
crawford
were
major
crawford
daughters
and
they
kept
house
for
marse
john
that
morning
in
may
i
was
wearing
a
sleeveless
apron
and
they
miss
fannie
and
miss
ann
put
a
bag
of
gold
and
silver
and
some
old
greenback
confederate
money
in
my
apron
and
told
me
to
hold
on
to
it
miss
fannie
and
miss
ann
both
of
them
patted
me
on
the
head
and
said
be
a
good
little
girl
and
do
move
on
came
the
blue
coats
they
went
all
over
the
house
searching
everything
with
their
guns
and
swords
shining
and
flashing
i
was
so
scared
the
sweat
was
running
down
my
face
in
streams
bless
your
life
when
they
came
to
the
bedroom
where
i
was
standing
by
a
bed
holding
that
money
inside
my
apron
they
did
even
glance
at
me
the
second
time
little
did
they
think
that
little
slave
girl
had
the
money
they
were
hunting
for
after
the
yankees
were
gone
i
gave
it
all
back
to
miss
fannie
and
she
did
give
me
the
first
penny
if
any
of
the
money
was
given
to
my
mother
she
did
tell
me
about
it
i
am
going
to
tell
you
the
truth
about
what
we
had
to
eat
so
listen
now
it
was
egg
bread
biscuits
peas
potatoes
they
they
were
called
then
artichoke
pickles
tea
cakes
pies
and
good
old
healthy
lye
hominy
there
was
plenty
of
meat
served
but
i
was
not
allowed
to
eat
that
as
i
was
never
a
very
strong
child
i
was
a
fool
about
stale
bread
such
as
biscuit
cornbread
and
light
bread
mother
was
a
fine
cook
and
her
battercakes
would
just
melt
in
your
mouth
of
course
you
know
we
had
no
stoves
in
those
days
and
the
cooking
was
done
in
open
fireplaces
in
ovens
and
pots
oh
yes
we
had
a
garden
there
was
only
one
on
the
place
and
enough
was
raised
in
it
to
feed
all
of
the
people
living
there
i
do
remember
eating
rabbits
squirrels
and
fish
until
i
went
to
jackson
mississippi
with
miss
rosa
there
were
plenty
of
those
meats
in
mississippi
and
i
was
then
getting
old
enough
and
healthy
enough
to
be
allowed
to
eat
them
at
this
point
mary
insisted
on
serving
lunch
for
her
visitor
saying
that
she
had
lived
with
white
people
and
knew
how
to
cook
after
a
polite
refusal
the
story
was
continued
i
was
laughing
at
myself
just
the
other
day
about
those
homespun
dresses
and
sleeveless
aprons
i
wore
as
a
child
i
reckon
that
was
a
sign
you
were
coming
to
ask
me
about
those
things
i
kept
one
of
those
dresses
of
mine
until
my
own
baby
girl
wore
it
out
and
now
i
am
sorry
i
let
her
wear
it
for
it
would
be
so
nice
to
have
it
to
show
you
we
wore
just
a
one
piece
costume
in
summer
and
had
calico
and
muslin
dresses
for
sunday
wintertime
i
wore
a
balmoral
petticoat
osnaburg
drawers
and
well
jacob
i
never
thought
i
would
live
to
see
the
day
forget
what
our
dresses
were
called
anyway
they
were
of
woolen
material
in
a
checked
design
and
were
made
with
a
full
skirt
gathered
on
to
a
deep
yoke
uncle
patrick
hull
he
was
a
deep
slave
belonging
to
hull
made
all
the
shoes
for
marse
john
slaves
we
all
wore
brogans
oh
good
i
should
smile
a
better
man
than
marse
john
never
lived
nobody
better
not
beat
his
slaves
marse
john
was
the
postmaster
he
married
miss
sallie
eden
and
everybody
said
she
was
mighty
good
but
i
never
knew
her
for
she
died
when
i
was
a
baby
marse
john
and
his
wife
miss
sallie
had
three
children
they
were
miss
fannie
miss
rosa
and
marse
allie
miss
annie
crawford
who
teaches
in
the
school
here
is
marse
allie
daughter
she
do
know
me
so
well
but
i
know
mighty
well
who
she
is
i
think
i
have
already
told
you
that
misses
fannie
and
rosa
kept
house
for
their
brother
marse
john
after
their
mother
died
darling
please
get
this
right
the
plantation
is
a
dream
to
me
if
i
should
try
to
tell
you
about
it
i
am
sure
it
would
be
only
what
my
mother
told
me
about
it
in
the
years
long
after
the
surrender
whether
the
plantation
was
the
property
of
marse
john
or
his
father
william
crawford
i
do
know
but
i
am
sure
there
was
an
overseer
and
i
am
quite
sure
it
was
a
very
large
plantation
you
know
the
town
of
crawford
was
named
for
my
white
folks
the
only
thing
i
can
be
sure
of
from
my
own
memory
is
of
the
things
that
took
place
here
in
athens
breakfast
had
to
be
served
promptly
at
when
that
bell
sounded
at
night
god
bless
your
soul
you
had
to
be
in
your
house
and
you
had
to
be
in
bed
by
marse
john
never
punished
but
just
two
of
his
slaves
that
i
can
remember
but
i
have
seen
them
get
several
good
whippings
they
were
ned
and
william
aggie
and
lucy
boys
and
marse
john
cowhided
them
for
misbehaving
there
were
jails
during
slavery
time
but
marse
john
kept
his
slaves
straight
himself
and
did
not
allow
any
of
them
to
be
taken
to
jail
i
have
never
seen
slaves
sold
but
i
have
seen
droves
of
them
marching
by
being
taken
to
watkinsville
to
be
sold
no
no
oh
no
you
had
better
not
dare
let
white
people
know
that
you
could
read
in
those
days
i
remember
one
colored
man
alfred
evans
who
used
to
read
the
bible
during
slavery
time
all
the
learning
i
have
i
got
after
we
were
made
free
there
were
two
colored
churches
in
athens
one
was
baptist
and
the
other
was
methodist
yankee
ladies
came
down
from
the
north
and
taught
us
to
read
and
write
i
have
often
considered
writing
the
history
of
my
life
and
finally
decided
to
undertake
it
but
i
found
that
it
was
more
of
a
job
than
i
had
expected
it
to
be
and
then
too
i
would
have
to
tell
too
much
so
i
thought
best
to
leave
it
alone
i
went
to
church
but
very
little
during
slavery
time
however
i
dearly
loved
to
go
to
sunday
school
and
never
missed
an
opportunity
of
attending
one
of
our
sunday
school
songs
was
worded
something
like
this
want
to
be
an
angel
and
with
the
angels
stand
my
favorite
song
began
the
throne
in
heaven
ten
thousand
children
stand
oo
yes
i
know
how
they
buried
folks
in
slavery
time
for
caskets
they
used
straight
white
pine
boxes
that
they
called
coffins
they
have
funerals
like
they
do
now
a
preacher
would
say
a
few
words
at
the
grave
and
then
he
prayed
and
after
that
everybody
sang
something
like
will
arise
and
go
to
jesus
i
was
a
singer
in
my
younger
days
all
i
remember
negroes
going
off
to
the
north
was
when
their
masters
took
them
along
on
trips
to
wait
on
them
bless
your
life
that
was
one
time
when
the
ones
that
could
read
and
write
had
the
advantage
they
were
usually
chosen
to
go
along
so
if
anything
happened
to
the
marster
on
the
trip
they
could
write
back
home
i
never
saw
patrollers
but
i
heard
that
they
used
to
beat
up
negroes
who
were
caught
away
from
home
without
a
pass
marse
john
kept
his
slaves
supplied
with
passes
at
all
necessary
times
not
all
the
slaves
had
to
work
on
saturday
afternoons
this
was
their
time
of
the
week
to
get
together
and
have
a
little
fun
around
their
quarters
sunday
mornings
they
went
to
church
as
a
rule
and
on
sunday
nights
they
visited
each
other
and
held
prayer
meetings
in
their
homes
do
get
me
wrong
they
had
to
have
passes
to
go
visiting
and
attend
those
prayer
meetings
christmas
time
was
a
holiday
season
for
slaves
and
they
had
everything
good
you
could
want
to
eat
listen
child
i
am
telling
you
the
truth
they
even
had
pumpkin
pie
oh
yes
santa
claus
came
to
see
slave
children
once
i
got
too
smart
for
my
own
good
miss
fannie
and
miss
ann
had
told
us
to
go
to
bed
early
they
said
if
we
were
asleep
when
santa
claus
got
there
he
would
go
away
and
never
come
back
well
that
night
i
made
up
my
mind
to
stay
awake
and
see
santa
claus
miss
fannie
and
miss
ann
slipped
into
our
quarters
right
easy
and
quiet
and
were
filling
up
stockings
with
candy
dolls
and
everything
you
can
imagine
while
they
were
doing
that
they
turned
around
and
saw
me
with
my
eyes
wide
open
right
there
my
santa
claus
ended
we
did
have
any
special
observance
of
new
year
day
it
was
the
same
as
any
other
day
mother
said
they
had
cornshuckings
quiltings
and
cotton
pickings
on
the
plantation
she
told
me
a
good
deal
about
the
cornshuckings
about
how
they
selected
a
general
whose
job
was
to
get
up
on
top
of
the
corn
pile
and
holler
at
the
top
of
his
voice
leading
the
cornshucking
song
while
the
others
all
shucked
the
corn
and
sang
after
the
corn
was
all
shucked
there
were
always
fine
eats
i
can
remember
the
quiltings
myself
the
women
went
from
one
house
to
another
and
quilted
as
many
as
quilts
in
one
night
sometimes
after
the
quilts
were
all
finished
they
had
a
big
spread
of
good
food
too
now
it
takes
a
whole
month
to
quilt
one
quilt
and
nothing
to
eat
what
games
did
we
play
let
me
see
oh
yes
one
of
them
was
played
to
the
rhyme
chickimy
craney
crow
i
went
to
the
well
to
wash
my
toe
when
i
got
back
my
chicken
was
gone
what
time
old
witch
then
we
would
run
and
chase
each
other
another
game
was
played
to
the
by
the
rhyme
that
started
mollie
bright
and
ten
honey
there
is
no
use
to
ask
me
about
raw
head
and
bloody
bones
when
folks
started
talking
about
that
i
always
left
the
room
it
is
a
shame
how
folks
do
frighten
children
trying
to
make
them
get
quiet
and
go
to
sleep
i
do
believe
in
and
ghosts
since
i
have
been
grown
i
have
been
around
so
many
dead
folks
i
have
learned
that
the
dead
harm
you
its
the
living
that
make
the
trouble
when
his
slaves
were
taken
sick
marse
john
always
called
in
a
doctor
an
old
woman
who
was
known
as
fannie
was
set
aside
to
nurse
sick
slaves
joe
carlton
was
marse
john
doctor
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
is
no
fairy
tale
once
i
was
so
sick
that
marse
john
called
in
carlton
richard
smith
crawford
long
and
james
long
before
they
found
out
what
was
wrong
with
me
i
had
inflammatory
rheumatism
and
i
wore
out
two
and
a
half
pairs
of
crutches
before
i
could
walk
good
again
now
crawford
long
is
a
great
and
famous
man
in
history
but
it
is
sure
true
that
he
doctored
on
this
old
negro
many
years
ago
honey
do
flatter
me
do
you
know
a
little
girl
years
old
ca
remember
everything
that
went
on
that
far
back
a
few
things
they
dosed
the
slaves
with
when
they
were
sick
was
horehound
tea
garlic
mixed
with
whiskey
and
the
vermifuge
tea
that
they
gave
to
negro
children
for
worms
that
dose
was
given
in
april
asafetida
was
used
on
us
at
all
times
and
sage
tea
was
considered
a
splendid
medicine
when
news
came
that
negroes
had
been
freed
there
was
a
happy
jubilee
time
marse
john
explained
the
new
freedom
to
his
slaves
and
we
were
glad
and
sorry
too
my
mother
stayed
with
marse
john
until
he
died
i
was
still
a
child
and
had
never
had
to
do
anything
more
than
play
dolls
and
keep
the
children
in
the
yard
lord
honey
i
had
a
fine
time
those
days
it
was
so
long
after
the
surrender
before
schools
for
negroes
were
opened
it
looked
like
they
went
wild
trying
to
do
just
like
their
white
folks
had
done
as
for
buying
homes
i
do
know
where
they
would
have
gotten
the
money
to
pay
for
homes
and
land
at
the
time
i
married
i
was
a
washerwoman
for
the
white
folks
my
first
husband
was
isaac
dixon
who
came
from
some
place
in
alabama
and
had
been
owned
by
lipscomb
the
chancelor
of
the
university
lipscomb
married
us
in
the
colored
methodist
church
and
that
night
the
church
was
crowded
to
overflowing
i
wore
a
white
dress
made
with
a
long
train
that
was
the
style
then
after
the
ceremony
my
mother
served
cake
and
wine
at
her
house
our
six
children
were
prettier
than
you
but
only
three
of
them
lived
to
get
grown
our
white
friends
named
our
children
my
first
husband
died
and
then
i
married
jones
colbert
who
belonged
to
marse
fletcher
colbert
of
madison
county
we
just
went
around
to
the
preacher
house
and
got
married
jones
was
an
old
man
when
i
married
him
he
was
a
preacher
he
is
dead
now
and
so
are
all
my
children
except
one
i
have
one
grandson
and
this
is
the
shameful
part
about
him
his
mother
wo
married
when
he
was
born
but
of
course
she
married
later
now
i
am
going
to
tell
you
the
truth
as
i
see
it
abraham
lincoln
was
an
instrument
of
god
sent
to
set
us
free
for
it
was
god
will
that
we
should
be
freed
i
never
did
hitch
my
mind
on
jeff
davis
like
the
children
of
israel
he
had
his
time
to
rule
booker
washington
well
now
i
did
give
him
a
thought
he
had
to
do
his
part
his
mistress
had
taught
him
to
read
why
did
i
join
the
church
well
when
the
white
folks
sent
their
help
off
to
mississippi
trying
to
keep
them
slaves
my
sister
and
i
went
with
miss
rosa
crawford
to
jackson
before
i
left
home
my
mother
gave
me
an
alabaster
doll
and
told
me
to
be
a
good
girl
and
pray
every
night
well
i
never
saw
so
many
in
my
life
as
i
saw
in
mississippi
every
night
when
i
heard
a
colored
man
named
ben
praying
in
his
room
that
made
me
think
of
what
my
mother
had
told
me
and
i
grew
more
and
more
homesick
for
her
finally
one
night
i
crept
into
uncle
ben
room
and
asked
him
to
tell
me
about
god
and
he
did
after
that
every
night
i
went
into
his
room
and
we
prayed
together
yes
honey
i
found
god
in
jackson
mississippi
and
i
joined
the
church
just
as
soon
as
i
could
after
i
got
back
to
my
mother
and
dear
old
athens
yes
honey
i
was
raised
and
loved
by
my
own
white
folks
and
when
i
grew
to
be
old
enough
and
large
enough
i
worked
for
them
i
have
been
with
or
worked
for
white
folks
all
my
life
and
just
let
me
tell
you
i
had
the
best
white
folks
in
the
world
but
it
was
by
god
plan
that
the
negroes
were
set
free

of
a

georgia
quaked
open
and
john
cole
confronted
a
man
illustration
yes
he
was
the
son
of
lucius
cole
and
betsy
cole
was
in
his
year
and
remembered
the
time
way
back
when
other
men
with
their
strange
ways
had
descended
on
athens
and
far
beyond
that
back
to
the
time
when
they
had
tried
him
out
as
a
scullion
boy
in
the
big
town
house
where
his
mother
was
the
cook
but
it
seemed
that
the
trays
always
escaped
his
clumsy
young
hands
so
marse
henry
had
put
him
on
the
acre
oglethorpe
plantation
as
apprentice
to
training
of
the
farm
horses
whose
large
unmanageableness
he
found
more
manageable
than
the
dainty
china
of
the
banker
house
he
simply
had
followed
more
after
his
father
the
carriage
driver
than
his
mother
the
cook
of
course
all
fifteen
of
the
hands
worked
from
to
but
his
aunt
was
the
plantation
cook
and
it
was
not
so
bad
there
the
night
brought
no
counsel
but
it
brought
better
stretch
over
and
you
had
tambourines
saw
bones
from
off
a
cow
knock
them
together
and
call
it
hw
a
drum
or
use
on
and
you
had
your
entire
orchestra
grow
older
and
get
by
the
gates
with
a
pass
you
had
to
have
a
pass
or
the
would
get
you
and
you
had
you
a
woman
if
the
woman
was
willing
a
good
hand
could
always
get
the
master
to
make
the
girl
marry
him
whether
or
no
if
a
hand
were
noted
for
raising
up
strong
black
bucks
bucks
that
would
never
let
the
monkey
get
them
while
in
the
hoeing
he
would
be
sent
out
as
a
species
of
to
the
other
plantations
to
plantations
where
there
was
of
worthless
young
nigger
gals
there
he
would
be
married
off
again
time
and
again
this
was
thrifty
and
saved
any
actual
purchase
of
new
stock
always
on
saturday
afternoon
you
would
have
till
first
dark
for
and
from
first
dark
till
meeting
for
drinking
and
dancing
sunday
you
could
go
to
the
colored
church
with
benefit
of
white
clergy
or
you
could
go
to
the
white
church
just
like
real
class
except
you
sat
in
the
rear
no
it
was
not
a
bad
life
you
usually
were
sick
but
if
you
were
sick
it
afforded
you
the
luxury
of
tea
turpentine
and
caster
oil
composed
the
entire
turpentine
was
used
for
sore
throats
cuts
and
bruises
castor
oil
was
used
for
everything
else
except
a
major
fracture
which
called
for
the
master
sending
in
a
doctor
to
the
quarters
yes
the
men
with
the
blue
uniforms
and
the
shiny
brass
buttons
had
descended
from
the
north
on
athens
descended
in
spite
of
the
cannon
that
the
little
master
and
the
little
men
had
tried
on
them
the
blue
clad
invaders
had
come
in
despite
of
the
quick
and
the
cannon
and
bob
toombs
boast
that
he
could
beat
the
damn
yankees
with
before
breakfast
if
only
they
had
fought
that
way
if
only
they
had
hw
not
needed
had
enough
to
invent
cannon
mouths
that
spoke
at
the
same
time
and
were
meant
to
mow
down
men
with
a
long
chain
if
only
they
had
not
been
able
to
fight
long
after
bull
run
and
after
breakfast
yes
the
yankees
had
come
over
the
classic
hills
of
athens
athens
that
had
so
many
hills
that
she
would
have
been
named
rome
except
for
her
first
college
had
left
and
had
come
again
to
stay
and
to
bring
freedom
to
john
cole
and
his
kind
this
was
six
months
after
lee
and
his
palandins
had
laid
down
the
sword
the
gallant
the
unstained
but
alas
claimed
meade
batteries
the
unconstitutional
sword
six
months
had
gone
and
freedom
had
come
but
john
cole
slave
of
henry
hull
the
banker
found
that
his
freedom
was
the
freedom
of
the
big
oak
athens
famed
he
was
free
but
he
had
no
way
to
go
anywhere
he
was
rooted
in
the
soil
and
would
stay
fast
rooted
he
worked
on
with
his
master
for
years
without
pay
did
he
believe
back
in
slavery
time
in
signs
and
in
sayings
that
the
itching
foot
meant
the
journey
to
new
lands
that
the
midnight
threnody
meant
murder
no
when
he
was
a
young
buck
and
had
managed
the
bad
horses
he
had
had
no
such
beliefs
no
he
was
not
superstitious
if
the
foot
itched
something
ought
to
be
put
on
it
or
taken
off
it
and
as
to
the
hounds
yelping
nobody
ever
knew
what
foolishness
a
might
be
up
to
but
he
was
old
now
death
always
comes
in
the
afternoon
he
does
believe
in
things
that
have
been
proved
he
does
believe
that
a
screeching
is
a
sure
sign
of
death
lowing
of
a
cow
in
afternoon
georgia
meadows
means
death
mighty
close
if
death
come
down
to
a
house
better
stop
clock
and
put
white
cloth
on
mirrors
no
loud
talking
permitted
better
for
any
nigger
to
bow
low
down
to
death
to
what
factors
did
he
attribute
his
long
life
queried
the
man
long
living
came
from
leaving
off
smoking
and
drinking
would
he
have
a
nickle
cigar
he
would
yes
he
was
feeling
quite
thank
you
but
he
believed
now
in
the
owl
and
the
cow
and
the
clock
in
the
one
lives
but
death
always
come
in

the
bareness
of

was
relieved
by
a
single
rosebush
and
her
small
house
might
best
be
described
as
a
shack
an
unsteady
wooden
box
served
as
a

the

minnie
hobbled
to
the
door
and
invited
the
visitor
to
her
bedroom
where
a
suite
of
handsome
walnut
furniture
reflected
the
period
when
marble
tops
were
standard
parts
of
dressers
and
washstands
a
low
chair
an
old
table
and
a
rusty
heater
completed

of

age
and
ill
health
have
not
dealt
kindly
with
minnie
and
her
kinky
hair
is
almost
white
but
her
eyes
and
face
retain
a
remarkably
youthful
appearance
she
is
a
small
thin
woman
of
gingercake
color
and
despite
the
sweltering
heat
she
wore
a
pink
flannel
nightgown
faded
and
dingy
and
a
pair
of
high
top
black
shoes
so
badly
run
over
that
she
hobbled
along
on
the
sides
of
them
minnie
is
well
educated
and
she
taught
school
for
so
long
that
her
speech
is
remarkably
free
of
dialect
when
the
nature
of
the
visit
was
explained
minnie
said
a
white
woman
has
been
here
several
times
before
but
i
was
sick
and
did
understand
clearly
what
she
wanted
me
to
tell
her
she
then
explained
that
she
did
not
care
to
talk
for
publication
at
all
she
said
she
was
hungry
and
had
nothing
at
all
in
the
house
to
eat
her
nephew
ed
an
lived
with
her
she
explained
and
he
would
go
for
food
if
there
was
any
money
she
might
feel
like
talking
a
little
if
she
had
a
little
something
to
eat
the
interviewer
provided
the
cash
and
ed
soon
returned
with
a
pint
of
milk
and
some
cinnamon
rolls
after
her
repast
minnie
began
to
talk
giving
the
impression
that
every
word
was
carefully
weighed
before
it
was
uttered
i
was
born
in
greene
county
near
penfield
georgia
she
said
aggie
crawford
was
my
mother
and
she
was
married
to
jim
young
my
only
sister
was
mariah
and
my
three
brothers
were
ned
john
and
jim
ned
was
a
mulatto
i
know
who
his
father
was
but
of
course
you
wo
ask
me
that
i
would
want
to
expose
my
own
mother
or
the
man
who
was
ned
father
i
was
quite
a
small
child
during
the
war
period
and
i
can
tell
you
very
little
of
that
time
except
the
things
my
mother
told
me
when
i
grew
old
enough
to
remember
my
mother
belonged
to
the
crawford
family
in
greene
county
but
when
i
knew
anything
we
were
living
in
athens
and
were
the
slaves
of
marster
john
crawford
as
children
we
played
around
the
yard
those
of
us
who
were
old
enough
had
odd
jobs
to
do
the
unceiled
house
that
my
father
and
mother
shared
with
three
other
families
was
weatherboarded
and
had
a
chimney
made
of
sticks
and
dirt
there
was
a
bed
in
each
corner
of
the
room
and
from
one
to
three
children
slept
in
the
bed
with
their
parents
the
rest
of
the
children
slept
on
the
floor
the
tall
old
wooden
beds
had
very
much
the
appearance
of
beds
used
now
except
that
cords
were
used
instead
of
the
metal
springs
that
came
into
use
later
our
osnaburg
mattress
ticks
were
filled
with
straw
i
quite
sure
there
were
no
pillows
there
was
also
a
house
on
the
lot
for
slaves
she
was
asked
what
she
called
her
father
and
mother
during
slavery
time
and
her
reply
was
i
have
always
said
father
and
mother
because
i
liked
it
better
and
the
bible
teaches
us
to
say
that
grandmother
dilsey
and
grandfather
levi
crawford
lived
in
lexington
i
saw
my
grandmother
one
time
but
i
do
know
what
she
did
at
the
white
folks
house
grandfather
was
a
carpenter
i
never
got
any
money
in
slavery
time
if
the
slaves
ever
got
any
it
was
when
the
yankees
came
through
here
at
that
time
the
white
people
gave
their
money
to
the
slaves
for
safekeeping
and
after
the
yankees
went
on
it
was
returned
to
the
white
owners
my
mother
was
the
cook
and
looked
after
the
house
oh
yes
indeed
we
had
good
food
to
eat
bread
milk
meat
collard
greens
turnips
and
potatoes
i
would
say
we
had
just
everything
that
was
grown
in
the
garden
and
on
the
plantations
to
eat
at
that
time
the
cooking
was
done
in
the
kitchen
in
the
yard
the
fireplace
was
as
wide
as
the
end
of
this
room
and
a
long
iron
bar
extended
from
one
end
to
the
other
the
great
cooking
pots
were
suspended
over
the
coals
from
this
bar
by
means
of
pot
hooks
heavy
iron
skillets
with
thick
lids
were
much
used
for
baking
and
they
had
ovens
of
various
sizes
i
have
seen
my
mother
bake
beautiful
biscuits
and
cakes
in
those
old
skillets
and
they
were
ideal
for
roasting
meats
mother
batter
cakes
would
just
melt
in
your
mouth
and
she
could
bake
and
fry
the
most
delicious
fish
there
was
no
certain
thing
that
i
liked
to
eat
more
than
anything
else
in
those
days
i
was
young
and
had
a
keen
appetite
for
all
good
things
miss
fannie
and
miss
susan
often
made
candy
and
it
was
so
good
i
could
have
eaten
all
they
made
had
they
given
it
to
me
my
father
hired
his
time
out
he
made
and
sold
gingercakes
on
the
railroad
in
the
summertime
we
wore
homespun
dresses
made
with
a
full
skirt
gathered
onto
a
waist
in
the
wintertime
the
dresses
were
made
of
checked
woolen
material
called
linsey
cloth
for
underwear
we
wore
balmoral
petticoats
and
osnaburg
drawers
we
went
barefooted
most
of
the
time
i
remember
one
particular
time
when
the
ground
was
frozen
and
i
went
about
without
any
shoes
but
it
did
bother
me
barefooted
children
seldom
had
bad
colds
in
winter
we
wore
just
anything
on
sunday
but
we
had
to
look
nice
and
clean
marster
john
crawford
son
of
the
distinguished
william
crawford
was
my
owner
indeed
he
was
good
to
us
i
tell
you
after
awhile
about
the
time
he
would
let
the
town
marshal
whip
my
mother
they
told
me
his
wife
was
a
fine
woman
and
that
she
was
as
good
to
her
slaves
as
she
could
be
she
died
very
young
in
life
and
marse
john
sisters
miss
fannie
and
miss
susan
kept
house
for
him
after
that
marse
three
children
were
miss
fannie
miss
rosa
and
marse
allie
miss
rosa
married
marse
tom
golden
and
miss
fannie
married
a
gerdine
forgotten
his
first
name
marse
john
may
have
had
an
overseer
on
one
of
his
plantations
but
i
do
remember
i
do
know
he
did
have
a
carriage
driver
for
he
have
a
carriage
i
do
believe
i
can
describe
the
peculiar
shape
of
his
fine
house
it
was
on
dougherty
street
right
back
of
scudder
school
the
crawfords
were
considered
very
uppity
people
and
their
slaves
were
uppish
too
marse
john
did
have
many
slaves
and
they
had
to
get
up
and
get
going
early
every
morning
marse
john
was
postmaster
of
athens
and
had
to
be
in
his
office
by
eight
every
morning
so
he
ordered
that
his
breakfast
be
served
regularly
at
no
mam
our
white
folks
did
teach
their
slaves
to
read
and
write
because
it
was
against
the
law
however
they
did
read
the
bible
to
us
and
the
slaves
that
were
smart
enough
were
asked
to
repeat
the
verses
they
had
learned
from
hearing
miss
fannie
miss
sue
and
marse
john
read
the
crawford
children
were
caught
teaching
my
mother
to
read
and
write
but
they
were
made
to
stop
mother
was
quick
to
learn
and
she
never
gave
up
she
would
steal
the
newspapers
and
read
up
about
the
war
and
she
kept
the
other
slaves
posted
as
to
how
the
war
was
progressing
she
knew
when
the
war
was
over
almost
as
soon
as
marse
john
did
i
do
recall
any
certain
reason
why
the
slaves
were
punished
they
needed
it
i
sure
of
that
some
folks
need
to
be
punished
now
miss
sue
as
we
called
her
whipped
the
slaves
for
misbehavior
i
remember
one
time
there
was
quite
a
commotion
the
town
marshal
came
to
our
house
to
whip
my
mother
it
had
been
told
that
she
had
been
writing
letters
asking
people
to
buy
whiskey
from
her
but
marse
john
would
let
the
marshal
touch
her
there
was
a
jail
but
i
do
recall
that
any
of
marse
john
slaves
were
ever
put
in
there
i
was
told
that
his
slaves
were
as
a
rule
well
behaved
and
that
they
gave
him
no
trouble
yes
mam
we
went
to
church
that
is
those
of
us
who
cared
to
go
did
there
was
any
separate
church
for
colored
people
in
athens
that
i
can
remember
we
went
to
church
and
sunday
school
at
the
first
presbyterian
church
where
the
slaves
were
allowed
to
sit
in
the
gallery
i
recall
that
hoyt
used
to
pray
that
the
lord
would
drive
the
yankees
back
he
said
that
were
born
to
be
slaves
my
mother
said
that
all
the
time
he
was
praying
out
loud
like
that
she
was
praying
to
herself
lord
please
send
the
yankees
on
and
let
them
set
us
free
i
was
enough
of
a
singer
to
have
a
favorite
song
and
i
was
too
happy
playing
with
the
crawford
children
to
be
interested
in
going
to
baptizings
and
funerals
i
did
go
to
my
father
funeral
when
he
was
taken
sick
holt
attended
his
case
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
told
marse
john
that
father
would
never
get
well
when
he
died
mother
hollered
and
screamed
something
terrible
miss
sue
told
her
not
to
cry
because
lord
knows
best
miss
sue
answered
mother
you
have
never
loved
a
man
to
lose
with
that
they
both
cried
when
anyone
died
in
those
days
the
people
sat
up
all
night
and
did
go
to
bed
until
the
funeral
was
over
now
no
real
sympathy
is
shown
i
do
believe
any
of
marse
john
slaves
ever
went
to
the
war
he
was
good
to
them
and
everyone
of
them
loved
him
i
heard
of
patterollers
chasing
slaves
and
whipping
them
if
they
were
caught
away
from
home
without
a
pass
and
sometimes
they
locked
them
up
however
nothing
of
the
kind
ever
happened
to
any
of
marse
john
slaves
he
was
a
highly
respected
citizen
and
everyone
in
athens
knew
better
than
to
touch
his
negroes
after
the
work
for
the
day
was
finished
at
the
big
house
the
slaves
went
to
their
quarters
to
weave
cloth
and
sew
but
when
ten
came
and
the
bell
sounded
everything
had
to
be
quiet
slaves
on
our
place
worked
saturday
afternoons
the
same
as
any
other
day
on
saturday
nights
the
young
folks
and
a
few
of
the
older
folks
danced
some
of
them
got
passes
from
marse
john
so
they
could
visit
around
they
popped
corn
pulled
candy
or
just
sat
around
and
talked
those
of
us
who
desired
went
to
sunday
school
and
church
on
sundays
others
stayed
at
home
and
did
their
washing
and
ironing
and
there
was
always
plenty
of
that
to
be
done
christmas
was
a
grand
time
at
marse
john
we
had
everything
good
to
eat
under
the
sun
at
that
time
and
as
my
mother
was
the
cook
i
was
sure
of
getting
my
share
of
the
good
things
miss
fannie
and
miss
sue
played
santa
claus
to
slave
children
i
was
sorry
when
mary
got
too
smart
and
peeped
to
see
what
it
was
all
about
for
after
that
they
just
came
to
our
house
and
handed
us
the
things
that
would
have
come
as
santa
claus
new
year
day
was
no
different
from
other
days
except
that
marse
john
gave
the
grown
folks
whiskey
to
drink
that
day
like
he
did
on
christmas
morning
they
could
risk
giving
slaves
much
whiskey
because
it
made
them
mean
and
then
they
would
fight
the
white
folks
they
had
to
be
mighty
careful
about
things
like
that
in
order
to
keep
down
uprisings
my
mother
went
to
cornshuckings
cotton
pickings
and
quiltings
they
must
have
had
wonderful
times
to
hear
her
tell
it
she
said
that
after
the
corn
was
shucked
cotton
picked
or
quilts
quilted
they
always
gave
them
plenty
of
good
things
to
eat
and
drink
and
let
them
aloose
to
enjoy
themselves
for
the
balance
of
the
night
those
things
took
place
at
harvest
time
and
everyone
looked
forward
to
having
a
good
time
at
that
season
mother
said
that
marse
john
was
particular
with
his
slaves
and
would
let
them
go
just
anywhere
to
these
things
about
the
only
game
i
can
remember
playing
as
a
child
was
a
doll
game
the
crawford
children
would
use
me
for
the
doll
and
then
when
my
turn
came
to
play
mamma
and
claim
one
of
them
for
my
doll
miss
fanny
or
miss
sue
would
appear
and
then
i
would
have
to
be
a
doll
for
them
i
mind
for
i
dearly
loved
them
all
now
about
raw
head
and
bloody
bones
i
am
going
to
tell
you
miss
my
marster
people
were
cultured
and
refined
and
they
would
allow
such
things
told
to
their
own
children
or
to
their
slaves
children
they
did
want
anything
said
or
done
to
frighten
any
little
children
and
if
a
nurse
or
anyone
else
was
caught
doing
such
a
thing
that
person
was
punished
for
it
with
the
heritage
of
training
like
that
i
could
hardly
be
expected
to
believe
in
such
things
marse
john
was
grand
to
sick
slaves
he
always
sent
for
moore
who
would
make
his
examination
and
write
out
his
prescription
when
he
left
his
parting
word
was
usually
him
a
sound
thrashing
and
he
will
get
better
of
course
he
did
mean
that
it
was
his
little
joke
holt
crawford
long
and
jones
long
were
sometimes
called
in
for
consultation
on
particularly
serious
cases
we
did
like
moore
and
usually
begged
for
one
of
the
other
doctors
i
do
think
my
white
folks
used
teas
made
of
herbs
leaves
or
roots
they
may
have
but
i
do
remember
it
however
i
do
know
that
we
wore
little
sacks
of
asafetida
around
our
necks
to
keep
off
diseases
and
the
white
folks
wore
it
too
on
the
day
we
learned
of
the
surrender
the
negroes
rallied
around
the
liberty
flag
pole
that
they
set
up
near
where
the
city
hall
is
now
all
day
long
they
cut
up
and
there
was
a
song
they
sung
that
day
that
went
something
like
this
rally
around
the
flag
pole
of
liberty
the
union
forever
hurrah
boys
hurrah
next
morning
when
the
negroes
got
up
the
white
folks
had
cut
that
pole
down
we
were
mortally
afraid
of
the
yankees
when
they
appeared
here
a
short
time
after
the
surrender
we
were
afraid
of
the
ku
klux
klan
riders
too
the
negroes
did
act
so
bad
there
were
lots
of
killings
going
on
for
a
long
time
after
the
war
was
supposed
to
be
over
mother
was
glad
and
sorry
too
that
she
was
free
marse
john
had
been
so
good
to
all
his
slaves
that
none
of
them
really
wanted
to
leave
him
we
stayed
on
a
while
then
mother
left
and
rented
a
room
she
worked
hard
and
bought
a
house
as
soon
as
she
could
others
did
the
same
there
were
very
few
slaves
that
had
any
money
at
all
to
begin
on
immediately
following
the
surrender
northern
people
opened
knox
institute
one
of
my
teachers
was
miss
dora
brooks
a
white
woman
from
the
north
the
principal
was
a
white
man
he
was
sortur
after
i
graduated
from
knox
institute
i
went
to
the
atlanta
university
four
years
then
came
back
to
athens
and
taught
school
here
forty
years
i
taught
whatever
grade
they
assigned
me
to
each
year
never
any
certain
grade
from
year
to
year
first
and
last
i
taught
from
first
grade
through
high
school
i
would
be
teaching
now
if
it
were
not
for
my
bad
health
i
receive
a
teacher
pension
but
have
never
applied
for
an
old
age
pension
my
husband
was
samuel
davis
publisher
of
the
i
published
this
newspaper
myself
for
a
short
while
after
his
death
then
sold
it
we
did
have
a
big
wedding
just
a
very
simple
one
at
my
mother
house
i
was
married
in
a
nice
white
dress
but
it
was
nothing
fancy
our
two
children
were
born
dead
once
i
had
a
nice
home
beautifully
furnished
all
i
have
left
of
it
is
this
old
house
and
my
good
bedroom
suite
the
rest
of
my
possessions
have
gotten
away
from
me
during
my
continued
illness
i
often
think
of
abraham
lincoln
he
did
a
good
deed
for
my
race
jeff
davis
was
a
good
man
and
no
doubt
he
thought
he
was
doing
the
right
thing
booker
washington
was
a
man
of
brilliant
mind
but
he
was
radically
wrong
in
many
of
his
views
pertaining
to
education
of
the
black
race
he
lectured
here
once
but
i
did
bother
to
hear
him
speak
yes
mam
indeed
i
had
rather
be
free
oh
religion
is
glorious
if
god
has
set
you
free
from
the
bonds
and
penalties

mose
davis
apr
in
one
of
atlanta
many
alleys
lives
mose
davis
an
who
was
born
on
a
very
large
plantation
miles
from
perry
georgia
his
master
was
colonel
davis
a
very
rich
old
man
who
owned
a
large
number
of
slaves
in
addition
to
his
vast
property
holdings
mose
davis
says
that
all
the
buildings
on
this
plantation
were
whitewashed
the
lime
having
been
secured
from
a
corner
of
the
plantation
known
as
the
lime
sink
colonel
davis
had
a
large
family
and
so
he
had
to
have
a
large
house
to
accommodate
these
members
the
mansion
as
it
was
called
was
a
great
big
affair
surrounded
by
a
thick
growth
of
cedar
trees
mose
parents
jennie
and
january
davis
had
always
been
the
property
of
the
davis
family
naturally
he
and
his
two
brothers
and
two
sisters
never
knew
any
other
master
than
the
old
colonel
davis
says
that
the
first
thing
he
remembers
of
his
parents
is
being
whipped
by
his
mother
who
had
tied
him
to
the
bed
to
prevent
his
running
away
his
first
recollection
of
his
father
is
seeing
him
take
a
drink
of
whiskey
from
a
five
gallon
jug
when
asked
if
this
against
the
plantation
rules
uncle
mose
replied
the
colonel
was
one
of
the
biggest
devils
you
ever
seen
he
the
one
that
started
my
daddy
to
drinking
sometimes
he
used
to
come
to
our
house
to
git
a
drink
hisself
mose
father
was
the
family
coachman
all
that
he
had
to
do
was
to
drive
the
master
and
his
family
and
to
take
care
of
the
two
big
grey
horses
that
he
drove
compared
to
my
mother
and
the
other
slaves
he
had
an
easy
time
said
uncle
mose
shaking
his
head
and
smiling
my
daddy
was
so
crazy
about
the
white
folks
and
the
horses
he
drove
until
i
believe
he
thought
more
of
them
than
he
did
of
me
one
day
while
i
was
in
the
stable
with
him
one
of
the
horses
tried
to
kick
me
and
when
i
started
to
hit
him
daddy
cussed
me
and
threatned
to
beat
me
his
mother
brothers
and
sisters
were
all
field
hands
but
there
was
never
any
work
required
of
mose
who
was
and
companion
to
manning
the
youngest
of
colonel
davis
five
sons
these
two
spent
most
of
the
time
fishing
and
hunting
manning
had
a
pony
and
buggy
and
whenever
he
went
to
town
he
always
took
mose
along
field
hands
were
roused
every
morning
by
the
overseer
who
rang
the
large
bell
near
the
slave
quarters
women
tr
and
young
children
were
permitted
to
remain
at
home
until
to
prepare
breakfast
at
these
women
had
to
start
to
the
fields
where
they
worked
along
with
the
others
until
sundown
the
one
break
in
the
day
work
was
the
noon
dinner
hour
field
hands
planted
and
tended
cotton
corn
and
the
other
produce
grown
on
the
plantation
until
harvest
time
when
everybody
picked
cotton
slaves
usually
worked
harder
during
the
picking
season
than
at
any
other
time
after
harvest
the
only
remaining
work
was
cleaning
out
fence
corners
splitting
rails
building
fences
and
numerous
other
minor
tasks
in
hot
weather
the
only
work
was
shelling
corn
there
was
no
sunday
work
other
than
caring
for
the
stock
on
this
plantation
there
were
quite
a
few
skilled
slaves
mostly
blacksmiths
carpenters
masons
plasterers
and
a
cobbler
one
of
mose
brothers
was
a
carpenter
all
slaves
too
old
for
field
work
remained
at
home
where
some
took
care
of
the
young
children
while
others
worked
in
the
loom
houses
helping
make
the
cloth
and
the
clothing
used
on
the
plantation
since
no
work
was
required
at
night
this
time
was
utilized
by
doing
personal
work
such
as
the
washing
and
the
repairing
of
clothing
etc
on
the
fourth
of
july
or
at
christmas
colonel
davis
always
had
a
festival
for
all
his
slaves
barbecue
was
served
and
there
was
much
singing
and
dancing
these
frolics
were
made
merrier
by
the
presence
of
guests
from
other
plantations
music
was
furnished
by
some
of
the
slaves
who
also
furnished
music
at
the
mansion
whenever
the
or
some
of
the
members
of
his
family
had
a
party
there
was
also
a
celebration
after
the
crops
had
been
gathered
although
there
was
only
one
distribution
of
clothing
per
year
nobody
suffered
from
the
lack
of
clothes
because
this
one
lot
had
enough
to
last
a
year
if
properly
cared
for
the
children
wore
one
piece
garments
a
cross
between
a
dress
and
a
slightly
lengthened
shirt
made
of
homespun
or
crocus
material
tr
note
crocus
is
a
coarse
loosely
woven
material
like
burlap
no
shoes
were
given
them
until
winter
and
then
they
got
the
of
the
grown
ups
the
men
all
wore
pants
made
of
material
known
as
ausenberg
the
shirts
and
under
wear
were
made
of
another
cotton
material
dresses
for
the
women
were
of
striped
homespun
all
shoes
were
made
on
the
premises
of
the
heaviest
leather
clumsely
fashioned
and
uncle
mose
says
that
slaves
like
his
father
who
worked
in
the
mansion
were
given
much
better
clothing
his
father
received
of
the
colonel
and
his
grown
sons
many
discarded
clothes
one
of
the
greatest
thrills
of
mose
boyhood
was
receiving
first
pair
of
ausenberg
pants
as
his
mother
had
already
taught
him
to
knit
by
using
four
needles
at
one
time
all
that
he
had
to
do
was
to
go
to
his
hiding
place
and
get
the
socks
that
he
had
made
none
of
the
clothing
worn
by
the
slaves
on
this
particular
plantation
was
bought
everything
was
made
by
the
slaves
even
to
the
dye
that
was
used
asked
if
there
was
sufficient
food
for
all
slaves
uncle
mose
said
i
never
heard
any
complaints
at
the
end
of
each
week
every
family
was
given
some
fat
meat
black
molasses
meal
and
flour
in
quantity
varying
with
the
size
of
the
family
at
certain
intervals
during
the
week
they
were
given
vegetables
here
too
as
in
everything
else
mose
father
was
more
fortunate
than
the
others
since
he
took
all
his
meals
at
the
mansion
where
he
ate
the
same
food
served
to
the
master
and
his
family
the
only
difference
between
and
sunday
diet
was
that
biscuits
were
served
on
sundays
the
children
were
given
only
one
biscuit
each
in
addition
to
the
other
bread
was
considered
a
delicacy
all
food
stuff
was
grown
on
the
plantation
the
slave
quarters
were
located
a
short
distance
below
the
mansion
the
cabins
weatherboard
structures
were
arranged
so
as
to
form
a
there
was
a
wide
road
leading
from
the
home
to
these
cabins
furnishings
of
each
cabin
consisted
of
one
or
two
benches
a
bed
and
a
few
cooking
utensils
these
were
very
crude
especially
the
beds
some
of
them
had
four
posts
while
the
ends
of
others
were
nailed
to
the
walls
all
lumber
used
in
their
construction
was
very
heavy
and
rough
bed
springs
were
unheard
of
wooden
slats
being
used
for
this
purpose
the
mattresses
were
large
ausenberg
bags
stuffed
to
capacity
with
hay
straw
or
leaves
uncle
mose
told
about
one
of
the
slaves
named
ike
whose
entire
family
slept
on
bare
pine
straw
his
children
were
among
the
fattest
on
the
plantation
and
when
colonel
davis
tried
to
make
him
put
this
straw
in
a
bag
he
refused
claiming
that
the
pine
needles
kept
his
children
healthy
the
floors
and
chimneys
on
the
davis
plantation
were
made
of
wood
and
brick
instead
of
dirt
and
mud
as
was
the
case
on
many
of
the
other
surrounding
plantations
one
window
with
shutters
instead
of
window
panes
served
the
purpose
of
ventilation
and
light
at
night
pine
knots
or
candles
gave
light
the
little
cooking
that
the
slaves
did
at
home
was
all
done
at
the
open
fireplace
near
the
living
quarters
was
a
house
known
as
the
chillun
house
all
children
too
young
for
field
work
stayed
at
this
house
in
the
care
of
the
older
slave
women
there
was
no
hospital
building
on
the
premises
the
sick
had
to
remain
in
their
individual
cabins
where
they
too
were
cared
for
by
slaves
too
old
for
field
work
only
one
family
lived
in
a
cabin
mose
mother
and
father
each
had
a
separate
cabin
he
did
not
explain
the
reason
for
this
but
said
that
he
was
made
to
live
in
his
father
cabin
whenever
he
could
usually
when
his
father
was
away
with
the
colonel
for
a
day
or
two
he
stayed
in
his
mothers
cabin
the
only
difference
between
the
houses
we
lived
in
during
slavery
and
those
that
some
of
us
live
in
now
who
said
is
that
we
had
more
room
there
than
we
have
now
he
says
that
even
the
community
cook
house
was
larger
than
some
of
the
living
quarters
of
today
all
cabins
were
white
washed
the
same
as
the
other
buildings
on
the
plantation
and
the
occupants
were
required
to
keep
the
interiors
and
the
surrounding
clean
at
all
times
the
overseer
cabin
was
located
a
short
distance
away
from
the
slave
cabins
so
that
it
would
be
easier
for
him
to
keep
check
on
his
charges
there
was
little
if
any
sickness
but
colonel
davis
employed
a
doctor
who
visited
the
plantation
each
week
on
other
occasions
the
overseer
administered
such
remedies
as
castor
oil
turpentine
and
the
slaves
had
remedies
of
their
own
for
stomach
ache
they
used
a
tea
made
of
jimson
weeds
another
medicine
was
heart
leaf
tea
manual
and
religious
training
were
the
only
types
allowed
on
the
plantation
trades
like
carpentry
blacksmithing
etc
were
learned
from
the
white
mechanics
sometimes
employed
by
colonel
davis
all
slaves
were
required
to
attend
church
and
a
special
building
was
known
as
davis
chapel
a
negro
preacher
officiated
and
no
white
people
were
present
uncle
mose
does
know
what
was
preached
as
he
and
manning
always
slipped
into
town
on
sundays
to
see
the
girls
uncle
mose
says
he
and
manning
were
together
so
much
that
occasionally
they
even
slept
in
the
same
bed
sometimes
in
manning
house
and
sometimes
at
his
own
house
a
pool
for
baptism
was
filled
with
well
water
the
colored
pastor
performed
all
baptisms
and
marriages
book
learning
was
prohibited
in
any
form
sometimes
mose
tried
to
persuade
manning
to
teach
him
to
read
and
write
but
manning
always
refused
mose
cousin
who
was
taught
to
read
and
write
forged
colonel
davis
name
to
a
check
and
drew
the
money
from
the
bank
before
the
hand
writing
was
discovered
for
this
act
he
was
given
a
sound
whipping
and
assigned
to
hard
labor
by
the
master
and
said
uncle
mose
he
even
have
the
pleasure
of
spending
one
penny
when
asked
if
his
cousin
was
arrested
and
placed
in
jail
he
replied
that
the
jails
were
not
for
the
slaves
as
their
punishment
was
usually
left
to
their
individual
masters
when
his
cousin
was
whipped
this
was
an
exception
to
the
colonel
rule
he
was
entirely
against
any
form
of
whipping
his
usual
method
of
punishment
was
to
cut
off
individual
privileges
for
a
limited
amount
of
time
in
proportion
to
the
nature
of
the
offense
along
with
an
assignment
of
extra
heavy
work
the
fame
of
the
was
widespread
among
the
slaves
but
none
of
colonel
davis
servants
attempted
to
run
away
or
leave
the
plantation
often
without
the
required
pass
if
they
did
they
were
never
caught
there
was
very
little
talk
on
the
plantation
about
the
actual
beginning
of
the
civil
war
slaves
was
very
guarded
in
their
talk
as
they
feared
the
master
wrath
uncle
mose
thought
little
or
nothing
about
the
war
and
had
even
less
to
say
when
the
yankee
soldiers
came
to
the
plantation
they
drove
wagons
to
the
smoke
house
and
took
all
the
meat
away
the
funny
part
about
it
was
that
the
colonel
had
taken
shelter
in
this
particular
house
when
he
saw
the
yankees
coming
said
uncle
mose
he
did
have
time
to
hide
any
of
his
other
belongings
when
the
soldiers
had
left
the
colonel
looked
around
and
said
to
manning
and
mose
just
like
i
get
that
i
guess
i
can
get
some
more
uncle
mose
says
that
when
freedom
was
declared
his
father
came
rushing
to
their
cabin
waving
his
arms
like
a
windmill
shouting
boy
we
is
free
you
can
go
and
git
yourself
a
job
i
ai
goin
to
hitch
up
no
more
horses
some
of
the
slaves
remained
on
the
plantation
where
they
worked
for
wages
until
their
deaths
his
father
was
one
of
them
and
after
his
death
his
mother
moved
to
another
plantation
to
live
with
another
son
meanwhile
mose
started
traveling
from
place
to
place
as
soon
as
he
was
told
that
he
was
free
to
go
as
he
pleased
he
paid
one
visit
to
the
plantation
where
he
learned
of
his
father
death
he
then
asked
manning
who
was
operating
the
plantation
for
the
ox
that
had
belonged
to
his
father
and
when
manning
refused
to
part
with
this
animal
he
made
a
secret
visit
back
that
night
and
took
the
animal
away
he
has
not
been
back
since
at
this
time
davis
stretched
himself
saying
well
i
guess
about
as
straight
as
i
can
get
it
wish
that
i
could
tell
you
some
more

store
is
now
dat

buildin
was
tore
down
long
years

and
evvything
dar

changed
now
de
athens
hardware

is
de
only
broad
street
business
of
dem
days
dat

stood
in
de

place
and

den
as

very
well

git
a
sack
of
flour
for

a
load

so
cheap
dat
you
did
have
to
pay
over
a

too
large
to

the
standard
grooves
of

the
experience
of
george
eason
in
slavery
time
may
george
eason
was
born
in
forsyth
on
the
plantation
of
jack
ormond
in
addition
to
himself
there
were
six
other
children
one
of
whom
was
his
twin
brother
he
and
his
brother
were
the
oldest
members
of
this
group
of
children
his
mother
who
was
the
master
cook
had
always
belonged
to
the
ormond
family
while
his
father
belonged
to
another
family
having
been
sold
while
he
george
was
still
a
baby
it
so
happened
that
ormond
was
a
wealthy
planter
and
in
addition
to
the
plantation
that
he
owned
in
the
country
he
also
maintained
a
large
mansion
in
the
town
the
first
few
years
of
his
life
were
spent
in
town
where
he
helped
his
mother
in
the
kitchen
by
attending
to
the
fire
getting
water
etc
he
was
also
required
to
look
after
the
master
horse
unlike
most
other
slave
owners
who
allowed
their
house
servants
to
sleep
in
the
mansion
ormond
had
several
cabins
built
a
short
distance
in
the
rear
of
his
house
to
accommodate
those
who
were
employed
in
the
house
this
house
group
consisted
of
the
cook
seamstress
maid
butler
and
the
wash
woman
eason
and
those
persons
who
held
the
above
positions
always
had
good
food
because
they
got
practically
the
same
thing
that
was
served
to
the
master
and
his
family
they
all
had
good
clothing
the
women
dresses
being
made
of
calico
and
the
butler
suits
of
good
grade
cloth
the
particular
kind
of
which
eason
knows
nothing
about
he
himself
wore
a
garment
made
of
crocus
eason
was
about
or
years
of
age
when
he
was
first
sent
to
work
in
the
field
it
was
then
that
his
troubles
began
he
says
that
he
was
made
to
get
up
each
morning
at
and
that
after
going
to
the
field
he
had
to
toil
there
all
day
until
the
sun
went
down
he
and
his
fellow
slaves
had
to
work
in
all
types
of
weather
good
as
well
as
bad
although
the
master
or
the
overseer
were
not
as
cruel
as
some
he
had
heard
of
they
tolerated
no
looseness
of
work
and
in
case
a
person
was
suspected
of
loafing
the
whip
was
applied
freely
although
he
was
never
whipped
he
has
heard
the
whip
being
applied
to
his
mother
any
number
of
times
it
hurt
him
he
says
because
he
had
to
stand
back
unable
to
render
any
assistance
whatever
this
happened
before
he
was
sent
to
the
plantation
when
his
mother
got
these
whippings
she
always
ran
off
afterwards
and
hid
in
the
woods
which
were
nearby
at
night
she
would
slip
to
the
cabin
to
get
food
and
while
there
would
caution
him
and
the
other
children
not
to
tell
the
master
that
they
had
seen
her
the
master
wife
who
was
very
mean
was
always
the
cause
of
her
receiving
these
lashings
some
nights
after
he
and
the
other
slaves
had
left
the
field
they
were
required
to
do
extra
work
such
as
ginning
cotton
and
shelling
peas
and
corn
etc
the
young
women
were
required
to
work
that
in
some
respects
was
as
hard
as
that
the
men
did
while
the
older
women
usually
did
lighter
work
when
the
time
came
to
pick
the
cotton
all
hands
were
converted
into
pickers
night
was
the
only
time
that
they
had
to
do
their
washing
and
to
cultivate
the
small
gardens
they
were
allowed
to
have
during
the
months
when
there
was
little
field
work
to
do
they
were
kept
busy
repairing
fences
etc
on
the
farm
every
day
was
considered
a
working
day
except
sunday
thanksgiving
and
christmas
they
were
not
allowed
to
celebrate
on
these
days
as
were
the
slaves
on
other
nearby
plantations
clothing
on
the
ormond
plantation
was
usually
insufficient
to
satisfy
the
needs
of
the
slave
each
year
one
issue
was
given
each
slave
for
the
men
this
issue
consisted
of
pair
of
brogan
shoes
several
homespun
shirts
a
few
pairs
of
knitted
socks
and
two
or
three
pairs
of
pants
the
brogans
were
made
of
such
hard
leather
until
the
wearers
feet
were
usually
blistered
before
the
shoes
were
broken
in
the
women
in
addition
to
a
pair
of
shoes
and
some
cotton
stockings
were
given
several
homespun
dresses
on
one
occasion
eason
says
that
he
wore
his
shoes
out
before
time
for
an
issue
of
clothing
it
was
so
cold
until
the
skin
on
his
feet
cracked
causing
the
blood
to
flow
in
spite
of
this
his
master
would
give
him
no
more
shoes
all
clothing
was
made
on
the
plantation
except
the
shoes
those
women
who
were
too
old
for
field
work
did
the
sewing
in
addition
to
other
duties
to
be
described
later
indigo
was
cultivated
for
dyeing
purposes
and
in
some
instances
a
dye
was
made
by
boiling
walnut
leaves
and
walnut
hulls
in
water
in
addition
to
her
duties
as
cook
eason
mother
had
to
also
weave
part
of
the
cloth
he
told
of
how
he
had
to
sit
up
at
night
and
help
her
and
how
she
would
crack
him
on
the
head
for
being
too
slow
at
times
the
amount
of
food
given
each
slave
was
also
inadequate
as
a
general
rule
at
the
end
of
each
week
they
all
went
to
a
certain
spot
on
the
plantation
where
each
was
given
peck
of
meal
gal
of
syrup
and
pounds
of
meat
they
often
suffered
from
that
particular
stomach
ailment
commonly
known
as
hunger
at
such
times
raids
were
made
on
the
smokehouse
this
was
considered
as
stealing
by
the
master
and
the
overseer
but
to
them
it
was
merely
taking
that
which
they
had
worked
for
at
other
times
they
increased
their
food
by
hunting
and
fishing
possums
and
coons
were
the
usual
game
from
such
a
hunting
expedition
all
meals
usually
consisted
of
grits
bacon
syrup
corn
bread
and
vegetables
on
sundays
and
holidays
the
meals
varied
to
the
extent
that
they
were
allowed
to
have
biscuits
which
they
called
cake
bread
the
slaves
made
coffee
by
parching
corn
meal
okra
seed
or
irish
potatoes
when
sufficiently
parched
any
one
of
the
above
named
would
make
a
vile
type
of
coffee
syrup
was
used
for
all
sweetening
purposes
the
produce
from
the
gardens
which
the
master
allowed
them
could
only
be
used
for
home
consumption
and
under
no
circumstances
could
any
of
it
be
sold
the
cabins
that
the
slaves
occupied
were
located
on
one
section
of
the
plantation
known
as
the
quarters
these
dwellings
were
crude
structures
usually
made
from
logs
in
order
to
keep
the
weather
out
mud
was
used
to
close
the
openings
between
the
logs
in
most
instances
the
furnishing
of
a
cabin
was
complete
after
a
bed
a
bench
both
of
which
were
made
by
the
slave
and
a
few
cooking
utensils
had
been
placed
in
it
as
there
were
no
stoves
for
slave
use
all
cooking
was
done
at
the
fireplace
which
like
the
chimney
was
made
of
mud
and
stones
one
or
two
openings
served
the
purpose
of
windows
and
shutters
were
used
instead
of
glass
the
mattresses
on
which
they
slept
were
made
from
hay
grass
or
straw
when
a
light
was
needed
a
tallow
candle
or
a
pine
knot
was
lighted
absolute
cleanliness
was
required
at
all
times
and
the
floors
if
they
were
made
of
wood
had
to
be
swept
and
scrubbed
often
in
addition
to
the
private
dwellings
there
was
one
large
house
where
all
children
not
old
enough
to
go
to
the
field
were
kept
one
or
two
of
the
older
women
took
charge
of
them
seeing
that
they
had
a
sufficient
amount
of
corn
bread
vegetables
and
milk
each
day
all
were
fed
from
a
trough
like
little
pigs
these
old
women
were
also
responsible
for
the
care
of
the
sick
when
asked
if
a
doctor
was
employed
eason
replied
that
one
had
to
be
mighty
sick
to
have
the
services
of
a
doctor
the
usual
treatment
for
sick
slaves
was
castor
oil
which
was
given
in
large
doses
salts
and
a
type
of
pill
known
as
hippocat
ipecac
although
they
were
not
permitted
any
formal
type
of
learning
religious
worship
it
was
not
denied
them
each
sunday
ormond
required
that
all
his
slaves
attend
church
all
went
to
the
white
church
where
they
sat
in
back
and
listened
to
the
sermon
of
a
white
preacher
eason
says
that
the
slaves
believed
in
all
kinds
of
and
every
conceivable
type
of
signs
their
superstitions
usually
had
to
do
with
methods
of
conjure
a
preacher
was
never
used
to
perform
a
wedding
ceremony
on
the
ormond
plantation
after
the
man
told
the
master
about
the
woman
of
his
choice
and
she
had
been
called
and
had
agreed
to
the
plan
all
that
was
necessary
was
for
the
couple
to
join
hands
and
jump
over
a
broom
which
had
been
placed
on
the
ground
ormond
permitted
few
if
any
celebrations
or
frolics
to
take
place
on
his
farm
when
he
did
grant
this
privilege
his
slaves
were
permitted
to
invite
their
friends
who
of
course
had
to
get
a
pass
from
their
respective
masters
they
too
were
required
to
secure
a
pass
from
ormond
if
they
wanted
to
visit
off
the
premises
if
caught
by
the
paddle
rollers
patrollers
without
this
pass
they
were
soundly
whipped
and
then
taken
to
their
master
at
the
beginning
of
the
civil
war
all
the
slaves
talked
among
themselves
concerning
the
possible
outcome
of
the
war
however
they
never
let
the
master
or
the
overseer
hear
them
because
it
meant
a
whipping
when
sherman
and
his
army
marched
through
they
burned
all
the
gin
houses
on
the
ormond
plantation
and
took
all
the
available
live
stock
ormond
took
a
few
prized
possessions
and
a
few
slaves
one
of
whom
was
eason
and
fled
to
augusta
after
freedom
was
declared
he
was
still
held
in
bondage
and
hired
out
by
the
day
once
he
ran
away
but
was
found
and
brought
back
in
the
remaining
members
of
the
ormond
family
moved
to
atlanta
bringing
him
along
with
them
after
most
of
them
had
died
he
was
finally
permitted
to
go
or
stay
as
he
pleased
immediately
after
freedom
had
been
declared
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
find
his
father
however
he
never
got
a
chance
to
spend
any
time
with
him
as
the
ormonds
refused
to
release
him
says
eason
slavery
had
a
good
point
in
that
we
slaves
always
felt
that
somebody
was
going
to
take
care
of
us
he
says
that
he
has
heard
some
wish
for
the
good
old
days
but
as
for
himself
he
prefers
things
to
remain
as

he
fully
understood
this

reasons
for
approaching

he
consented
to
tell
what
he
had
seen
and
experienced
as
a
slave
chewing
slowly
on
a
large
wad
of
tobacco
he
began
his
account
in
the
following
manner
i
was
born
in
merriweather
county
in
near
the
present
location
of
greenville
georgia
besides
my
mother
there
were
eight
of
us
children
and
i
was
elder
than
all
of
them
with
one
exception
our
owner
was
favors
but
she
was
known
to
everybody
as
the
widow
favors
my
father
was
owned
by
a
darden
who
had
a
plantation
in
this
same
county
when
the
widow
husband
died
he
left
her
about
acres
of
land
and
a
large
sum
of
money
and
so
she
was
considered
as
being
rich
she
did
have
many
slaves
of
her
own
and
so
her
son
also
a
plantation
owner
used
to
send
some
of
his
slaves
over
occasionally
to
help
cultivate
her
crops
which
consisted
of
cotton
corn
and
all
kinds
of
vegetables
in
regard
to
her
treatment
of
the
slaves
that
she
held
favors
says
she
was
so
tight
and
then
she
was
pretty
tight
too
those
slaves
who
were
field
hands
were
in
the
field
and
at
work
by
the
time
it
was
light
enough
to
see
they
plowed
hoed
and
then
later
in
the
season
gathered
the
crops
after
the
harvesting
was
over
the
fences
were
repaired
and
rails
were
split
in
rainy
weather
nobody
had
to
work
out
of
doors
instead
they
shelled
the
peas
and
corn
and
sometimes
ginned
the
cotton
at
night
the
women
were
required
to
spin
and
to
weave
in
the
winter
season
no
work
was
required
at
night
unless
they
had
not
spun
as
much
thread
as
was
required
at
such
times
they
had
to
work
at
night
until
the
amount
set
had
been
reached
mr
favor
mother
was
the
cook
for
the
widow

and
her
two

four
hundred

the

his

was
a

darden
plantation
in

to
this
he
repaired
all
the
shoes
when
this
was
necessary
as
a
child
favors
was
not
very
strong
physically
and
because
of
this
the
widow
made
him
her
pet
he
never
had
to
do
any
work
other
than
that
of
waiting
on
the
mistress
while
she
ate
her
meals
even
in
this
he
had
to
get
up
at
four
in
the
morning
and
help
his
mother
in
the
kitchen
sometimes
he
would
sweep
the
yards
if
he
felt
like
doing
so
when
he
grew
older
he
was
given
the
task
of
picking
the
seed
out
of
the
cotton
at
night
on
sundays
all
the

were
free
to

and
shirts

one
garment
my
clothes
were
always
better
than
the
other
little

also
made
out
of
homespun
material
while

were
made
from
the
dresses
and
the
other
clothing
that
was
no
longer
fit
for
wear
as
a
general
rule
all
of
the

on
this
plantation
had
enough
food
to
keep
them
well
and
healthy
at
the
end
of
each
week

were
given
enough
food
to
last
them

of
three
and
pounds
of
pork
or

kitchen
by
one
of
the
women

was
too
old
for
work
in
the
fields
for
this
particular
meal
the

had
some
different
type
of
vegetable
each

meat
molasses
and
corn
bread
while

consisted
of
bread

only
variation
from

diet
was
on

bread
favors
was
asked
what
happened
if
anyone
food
was
all
eaten
before
it
was
time
for
the
weekly
issue

he
answered
it
was
just
too
bad
for
them
they
would
have
to
do
the
best
they
could
until
the
time
came
to
get
more
when
such
a
thing
happened
to
anyone
the
others
usually
helped
as
far
as
their
limited
supplies
would
permit
favors

that
he
his
mother
and
the
two
maids
ate
the
same
kind
of
food
that

were
served
after

had
seen
to
the
wants
of
all
at
the
table

had
to
take
a
seat
at
the
table
beside
his
owner
where
he
ate
with
her
and
the
others
seated
there
there
were
two
cabins
located
directly
behind
the
house
of
the
widow
the
entire
lot
of
them
were
built
out
of
logs
these
two
cabins
were
for
the
use
of
those
servants
who
worked
in
the
house
of
their
owner
at
one
end
of
each
cabin
there
was
a
wide
fireplace
which
was
made
of
sticks
stones
and
dried
mud
instead
of
windows
there
were
only
one
or
two
small
holes
cut
in
the
back
wall
of
the
cabin
the
beds
were
made
out
of
heavy
planks
and
were
called
georgia

by
the
slaves
wooden
slats

used
in
the
place
of
bed
springs
while
the
mattresses
were
merely
large
bags
that
had
been
stuffed
to
capacity
with
hay
wheat
straw
or
leaves
the
only
other
furnishings
in
each
of
these
cabins
were
several
benches
and
a
few
cooking
utensils
favors
says
we
did
have
plank
floors
like
these
on
some
of
the
other
plantations
the
plain
bare
ground
served
as
our
floor
as
he
made
this
statement
he
reminded
this
worker
that
he
meant
his
mother
and
some
of
the
other
house
servants
lived
in
these
cabins
he
himself
always
lived
in
the
house
with
the
widow
favors
who
had
provided
a
comfortable
bed
along
with
a
small
chair
for
his
use
these
slaves
who
worked
in
the
fields
lived
in
several
cabins
that
were
somewhat
nearer
to
their
fields
than
the
other
two
cabins
mentioned
above
the
remaining
buildings
on

the
younger
children
were
cared
for
by
another
old
person
the
woman
who
cared
for
these
children
had
to
also
help
with
the
cooking
whenever
any
of
the
slaves
were
sick
the
doctor
was
called
if
conditions
warranted
it
otherwise
a
dose
of
castor
oil
was
prescribed
favors
stated
that
after
freedom
was
declared
the
white
people
for
whom
they
worked
gave
them
oil
and
sometimes
both
of
which
had
the
same
effect
as
castor
oil
if
any
were
too
ill
to
work
in
the
field
one
of
the
others
was
required
to
remain
at
the
cabin
or
at
some
other
convenient
place
so
as
to
be
able
to
attend
to
the
wants
of
these
so
indisposed
when
favors
was
asked
if
the
servants
on
this
plantation
ever
had
the
chance
to
learn
how
to
read
or
to
write
he
answered
they
was
all
afraid
to
even
try
because
they
would
cut
these
off
and
he
held
up
his
right
hand
and
pointed
to
his
thumb
and
forefinger
at
any
rate
the
widow
nieces
taught
him
to
read
a
few
months
before
the
slaves
were
set
free
on
sunday
all
were
required
to
attend
the
white
church
in
town
they
sat
in
the
back
of
the
church
as
the
white
minister
preached
and
directed
the
following
text
at
them
do
steal
your
master
chickens
or
his
eggs
and
your
backs
wo
be
whipped
in
the
afternoon
of
this
same
day
when
the
colored
minister
was
allowed
to
preach
the
slaves
heard
this
text
obey
your
masters
and
your
mistresses
and
your
backs
wo
be
whipped
all
of
the
marriages
ware
performed
by
the
colored
preacher
who
read
a
text
from
the
bible
and
then
pronounced
the
couple
being
married
as
man
and
wife
although
nobody
was
ever
sold
on
the
favors
plantation
favors
has
witnessed
the
selling
of
others
on
the
auction
block
he
says
that
the
block
resembled
a
flight
of
steps
the
young
children
and
those
women
who
had
babies
too
young
to
be
separated
from
them
were
placed
on
the
bottom
step

in
their
early

went
from
the
bottom

to
the
top
one

is
the
younger
a
slave
was
the
more
money
he
brought
if
he
was
sold
sometimes
there
were
slaves
who
were
punished
by
the
overseer
because
they
had
broken
some
rule
favors
says
that
at
such
times
a
cowhide
whip
was
used
and
the
number
of
lashes
that
the
overseer
gave
depended
on
the
slave
owner
instructions
he
has
seen
others
whipped
and
at
such
times
he
began
praying
the
only
punishment
that
he
ever
received
was
as
a
little
boy
and
then
a
switch
was
used
instead
of
the
whip
if
the

a
slave
out
in
the
streets
without
a
pass
from
his
master
they
proceeded
to
give
the
luckless
fellow
five
lashes
with
a
whip

they
gave
six
lashes
if
the
slave
was
caught
out
at

by
the
widow
or
her
son

attempted
to
run

there
was
no
punishment
for
this
however
he
has
heard
that
on
other
plantations
blood
hounds
were
used
to
trail
those
who
ran
away
and
if
they
were
caught
a
severe
beating
was
administered
sometime
after

any
of
the
white

anything
about

its
possible
results
at
one
time
a
battle

being
fought
a
few
miles
distant
and
they
all

a
happy
day

that
his
old
age
is
due
to
the
fact
that
he

to
be
a
nurse
before

ended
she
was
inherited
by
gus
the
late
hon
little
she
remembers
that
all
the
quality
young
white
men
who
went
to
the
war
from
talbotton
took
negro
slaves
along
with
them
these
were
usually
called
and
it
was
a
duty
to
cook
wash
and
do
general
valet
service
for
his
master
in
a
pinch
he
was
also
supposed
to
raid
a
hen
roost
or
otherwise
rustle
food
for
his
white
fokes
according
to
aunt
mary
the
little
negroes
were
very
religious
and
given
to
much
loud
praying
and
singing
which
often
so
disturbed
little
that
he
gave
orders
for
them
to
stop
it
and
also
ordered
that
all
lights
in
the
slave
quarters
be
out
at
each
night
so
us
tuck
to
slippin
off
to
a

and
pray
whar

one
hant
in
my
life
an
i
didn
know
it
wuz
a
hant
aunt
peggy
an
old
slave
woman
tole
me
so
dis
hant
was
in
de
shape
o
a
duck
an
it
followed
me
one
day
frum
de
big
house
kitchen
ter
de
hawg
pen
whar
i
wuz
gwine
ter
slop

when

i
said
peggy
dar
a
strange
duck
done
tuck
up
wid
us
and
she
say
chile
dat
a
hant
i
been
seein
fur
severrel
years
an
dat
sholy
skeert
me
when
asked
if
she
had
ever
been
whipped
when
a
slave
aunt
mary
replied
yes
and
thank
god
fur
it
fur
ole
miss
taught
me
to
be
an
not
to
steal
she
admitted
that
being
whipped
for
stealing
made
her
an
honest
woman
aunt
mary
oldest
child
is
now
a
man
of
her
hair
is
as
white
as
cotton
and
her
eye
sight
is
dim
but
she
is
still
mentally
alert
she
says
that
colored
people
are
naturally
religious
and
that
they
learned
all
their
devilment
from
the
whites
she
deplores
the
wickedness
into
which
the
world
has
drifted
but
thanks
god
that
slavery
ended
when
it
did
she
has
never
had
any
particular
love
for
the
yankees
and
thinks
that
they
treated
the
southern
white
folks
most
scandalously
after
the
war
yet
feels
that
she
owes
them
a
debt
of
gratitude
for
freeing
her
people
she
admits
that
her
awful
hatred
of
slavery
was
born
of
her
sad
experience
as
a
girl
when
she
was
so
unceremoniously
separated
from
her
loved
ones
as
previously
told
she
is
also
of
the
firm
opinion
the
those
speculataws
who
brought
her
from
maryland
to
georgia
in
are
brilin
in
hell
fur
dey
sin
of
seperating
her
from
her
people
must
jesus
bear
the
cross
alone
and
all
the
world
go
free
no
there
is
a
cross
for
every
one
there
a
cross
for
me
this
consecrated
cross
i
shall
bear
til
death
shall
set
me
free
and
then
go
home
my
crown
to
wear
there
is
a
