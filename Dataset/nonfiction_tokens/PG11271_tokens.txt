have

you
have

witness
they
would
preserve
inviolate
alas
another
standard
has
been
devised
and
if
we
would
know
what
rights
are
conceded
to
us
by
our
own
servants
we
must
consult
the
compact

which
the

engages
on
certain

to
give
its
trade

all
rights
not
allowed
by

we
now
hold
by

our

avow
their
readiness
to
deprive
us
of
them
whenever
in
their
opinion
legislation
on
the
subject
shall
be

is

in

way

any
extent
whatever
to
the
subject
of

shall

with

fellow

while
we
call
your
attention
to
the
outrage
on
your
rights
the
contempt
of
personal
obligations
and
the
hardened
cruelty
involved
in
this
detestable
resolution
condemn
us
not
for
the
harshness
of
our
language
before
you
hear
our
justification
we
shall
speak
only
the
truth
but
we
shall
speak
it
as
freemen
the
right
of
petition
is
founded
in
the
very
institution
of
civil
government
and
has
from
time
immemorial
been
acknowledged
as
among
the
unquestionable
privileges
of
our
english
ancestors
this
right
springs
from
the
great
truth
that
government
is
established
for
the
benefit
of
the
governed
and
it
forms
the
medium
by
which
the
people
acquaint
their
rulers
with
their
wants
and
their
grievances
so
accustomed
were
the
americans
to
the
exercise
of
this
right
even
during
their
subjection
to
the
british
crown
that
on
the
formation
of
the
federal
constitution
the
convention
not
conceiving
that
it
could
be
endangered
made
no
provision
for
its
security
but
in
the
very
first
congress
that
assembled
under
the
new
government
the
omission
was
repaired
it
was
thought
some
case
might
possibly
occur
in
which
this
right
might
prove
troublesome
to
a
dominant
faction
who
would
endeavor
to
stifle
it
an
amendment
was
therefore
proposed
and
adopted
by
which
congress
is
restrained
from
making
any
law
abridging
the
right
of
the
people
peaceably
to
assemble
and
to
petition
the
government
for
a
redress
of
grievances
had
it
not
been
for
this
prudent
jealousy
of
our
fathers
instead
of
the
resolution
i
have
transcribed
we
should
have
had
a
law
visiting
with
pains
and
penalties
all
who
dared
to
petition
the
federal
government
in
behalf
of
the
victims
of
oppression
held
in
bondage
by
its
authority
the
present
resolution
can
not
indeed
consign
such
petitioners
to
the
prison
or
the
scaffold
but
it
makes
the
right
to
petition
a
congressional
boon
to
be
granted
or
withheld
at
pleasure
and
in
the
present
case
effectually
withholds
it
by
tendering
it
nugatory
petitions
are
to
inform
the
government
of
the
wishes
of
the
people
and
by
calling
forth
the
action
of
the
legislature
to
inform
the
constituents
how
far
their
wishes
are
respected
by
their
representatives
the
information
thus
mutually
given
and
received
is
essential
to
a
faithful
and
enlightened
exercise
of
the
right
of
legislation
on
the
one
hand
and
of
suffrage
on
the
other
but
the
resolution
we
are
considering
provides
that
no
petition
in
relation
to
slavery
shall
be
printed
for
the
information
of
the
members
nor
referred
to
a
committee
to
ascertain
the
truth
of
its
statements
nor
shall
any
vote
be
taken
in
regard
to
it
by
which
the
people
may
learn
the
sentiments
of
their
representatives
if
congress
may
thus
dispose
of
petitions
on
one
subject
they
may
make
the
same
disposition
of
petitions
on
any
and
every
other
subject
our
representatives
are
bound
by
oath
not
to
pass
any
law
abridging
the
right
of
petition
but
if
this
resolution
is
constitutional
they
may
order
every
petition
to
be
delivered
to
their
and
by
him
to
be
committed
to
the
flames
for
why
preserve
petitions
on
which
action
can
be
had
the
resolution
been
directed
to
petitions
for
an
object
palpably
unconstitutional
it
would
still
have
been
without
excuse
the
construction
of
the
constitution
is
a
matter
of
opinion
and
every
citizen
has
a
right
to
express
that
opinion
in
a
petition
or
otherwise
but
this
usurpation
is
aggravated
by
the
almost
universal
admission
that
congress
does
possess
the
constitutional
power
to
legislate
on
the
subject
of
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
territories
no
wonder
that
a
distinguished
statesman
refused
to
sanction
the
right
of
the
house
to
pass
such
a
resolution
by
even
voting
against
it

men
who
perpetrated
this
outrage

support
the
constitution

will
they
hereafter
plead
at
the
bar
of
their
maker
that
they
had
kept
their
oath

the
horse
or
the
ox
may
be
protected
in
the
district
by
act
of
congress
from
the
cruelty
of
its
owner
but
man
created
in
the
image
of
god
shall
if
his
complexion
be
dark
be
abandoned
to
every
outrage
the
negro
may
be
bound
alive
to
the
stake
in
front
of
the
capitol
as
well
as
in
the
streets
of
louis
his
shrieks
may
resound
through
the
representative
hall
and
the
stench
of
his
burning
body
may
enter
the
nostrils
of

but
no
vote
may
rebuke
the
abomination
no

forbid
its
repetition
the

of

may
regulate

and

the
district
of
columbia
is
henceforth
to
be
the
only
spot
on
the
face
of
the
globe
subjected
to
a
civilized
and
christian
police
in
which
avarice
and
malice
may
with
legal
impunity
inflict
on
humanity
whatever
sufferings
ingenuity
can
devise
or
depravity
desire
and
this
accumulation
of
wickedness
cruelty
and
baseness
is
to
render
the
seat
of
the
federal
government
the
scoff
of
tyrants
and
the
reproach
of
freemen
forever
on
the
of
january
the
house
of
representatives
passed
the
following
vote
that
the
committee
of
the
district
of
columbia
be
instructed
to
inquire
into
the
expediency
of
providing
by
law
for
the
gradual
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
district
in
such
manner
that
no
individual
shall
be
injured
thereby
never
again
while
the
present
rule
of
order
is
in
force
can
similar
instructions
be
given
to
a
committee
never
again
shall
even
an
inquiry
be
made
into
the
expediency
of
abolishing
slavery
and
the
in
the
district
what
stronger
evidence
can
we
have
of
the
growing
and
spreading
corruption
caused
by
slavery
than
that
one
hundred
and
seventeen
republican
legislators
professed
believers
in
christianity
many
of
them
from
the
north
aye
even
from
the
land
of
the
pilgrims
should
strive
to
render
such
curses
perpetual
the
flagitiousness
of
this
resolution
is
aggravated
if
possible
by
the
arbitrary
means
by
which
its
adoption
was
secured
no
representative
of
the
people
was
permitted
to
lift
up
his
voice
against
it
to
plead
the
commands
of
the
constitution
which
is
violated
his
own
privileges
and
duties
which
it
contemned
the
rights
of
his
constituents
on
which
it
trampled
the
chains
of
justice
and
humanity
which
it
impiously
outraged
its
advocates
were
afraid
and
ashamed
to
discuss
it
and
forbidding
debate
they
perpetrated
in
silence
the
most
atrocious
act
that
has
ever
disgraced
an
american
legislature
a
and
was
no
reason
whatever
it
may
be
asked
assigned
for
this
bold
invasion
of
our
rights
this
insult
to
the
sympathies
of
our
common
nature
yes
connected
with
the
resolution
was
a
preamble
explaining
its
object
read
it
fellow
countrymen
and
be
equally
astonished
at
the
impudence
of
your
rulers
in
avowing
such
an
object
and
at
their
folly
in
adopting
such
an
expedient
to
effect
it
the
lips
of
a
free
people
are
to
be
sealed
by
insult
and
injury
footnote
a
a
debate
was
allowed
on
a
motion
to
the
report
for
the
purpose
of
preparing
a
resolution
that
congress
has
no
constitutional
power
to
interfere
with
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
but
when
the
sense
of
the
house
was
to
be
taken
on
the
resolution
reported
by
the
committees
all
debate
was
prevented
by
the
previous
question
whereas
it
is
extremely
important
and
desirable
that
the
agitation
on
this
subject
should
be
finally
arrested
for
the
purpose
of
restoring
to
the
public
mind
your
committee
respectfully
recommend
the
following
resolution
order
reigns
in
warsaw
were
the
terms
in
which
the
triumph
of
russia
over
the
liberties
of
poland
was
announced
to
the
world
when
the
right
of
petition
shall
be
broken
down
when
no
whisper
shalt
be
heard
in
congress
in
behalf
of
human
rights
when
the
press
shall
be
muzzled
and
the
freedom
of
speech
destroyed
by
then
will
the
slaveholders
announce
that
tranquillity
is
restored
to
the
public
mind
fellow
countrymen
is
such
the
tranquillity
you
desire
is
such
the
heritage
you
would
leave
to
your
children
suffer
not
the
present
outrage
by
effecting
its
avowed
object
to
invite
farther
aggressions
on
your
rights
the
chairman
of
the
committee
boasted
that
the
number
of
petitioners
the
present
session
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
district
was
thousand
let
us
resolve
we
beseech
you
that
at
the
next
session
the
number
shall
be
a
million
perhaps
our
one
hundred
and
seventeen
representatives
will
then
abandon
in
despair
their
present
dangerous
and
unconstitutional
expedient
for
tranquilizing
the
public
mind
the
purpose
of
this
address
is
not
to
urge
upon
you
our
own
views
of
the
sinfulness
of
slavery
and
the
safety
of
its
immediate
abolition
but
to
call
your
attention
to
the
conduct
of
your
rulers
let
no
one
think
for
a
moment
that
because
he
is
not
an
abolitionist
his
liberties
are
not
and
will
not
be
invaded
have
no
rights
distinct
from
the
rights
of
the
whole
people
calumny
falsehood
and
popular
violence
have
been
employed
in
vain
to
tranquilize
abolitionists
it
is
now
proposed
to
soothe
them
by
despoiling
them
of
their
constitutional
rights
but
they
can
not
be
despoiled
the
right
of
petition
and
the
freedom
of
debate
are
as
sacred
and
valuable
to
those
who
dissent
from
our
opinions
as
they
are
to
ourselves
can
the
constitution
at
the
same
time
secure
liberty
to
you
and
expose
us
to
oppression
give
you
freedom
of
speech
and
lock
our
lips
respect
your
right
of
petition
and
treat
ours
with
contempt
no
fellow
countrymen
we
must
be
all
free
or
all
slaves
together
we
implore
you
then
by
all
the
obligations
of
interest
of
patriotism
and
of
religion
by
the
remembrance
of
your
fathers
by
your
love
for
your
children
to
unite
with
us
in
maintaining
our
common
and
till
lately
our
unquestioned
political
rights
we
ask
you
as
men
to
insist
that
your
servants
acting
as
the
local
legislators
of
the
district
of
columbia
shall
respect
the
common
rights
and
decencies
of
we
ask
you
as
freemen
not
to
permit
your
constitutional
privileges
to
be
trifled
with
by
those
who
have
sworn
to
maintain
we
ask
you
as
christian
men
to
remember
that
by
sanctioning
the
sinful
acts
of
your
agents
you
yourselves
assume
their
guilt
we
have
no
candidates
to
recommend
to
your
favor
we
ask
not
your
support
for
any
political
party
but
we
do
ask
you
to
give
your
suffrages
hereafter
only
to
such
men
as
you
have
reason
to
believe
will
not
sacrifice
your
rights
and
their
own
obligations
and
the
claims
of
mercy
and
the
commands
of
god
to
an
iniquitous
and
mercenary
compact
if
we
can
not
have
northern
presidents
and
other
officers
of
the
general
government
except
in
exchange
for
freedom
of
conscience
of
speech
of
the
press
and
of
legislation
then
let
all
the
appointments
at
washington
be
given
to
the
south
if
slaveholders
will
not
trade
with
us
unless
we
consent
to
be
slaves
ourselves
then
let
us
leave
their
money
and
their
sugar
and
their
cotton
to
perish
with
them
fellow
countrymen
we
wish
we
recommend
no
action
whatever
inconsistent
with
the
laws
and
constitutions
of
our
country
or
the
precepts
of
our
common
religion
but
we
beseech
you
to
join
with
us
in
resolving
that
while
we
will
respect
the
rights
of
others
we
will
at
every
hazard
maintain

own

iv
respected
friends
it
is
because
i
feel
a
deep
and
tender
interest
in
your
present
and
eternal
welfare
that
i
am
willing
thus
publicly
to
address
you
some
of
you
have
loved
me
as
a
relative
and
some
have
felt
bound
to
me
in
christian
sympathy
and
gospel
fellowship
and
even
when
compelled
by
a
strong
sense
of
duty
to
break
those
outward
bonds
of
union
which
bound
us
together
as
members
of
the
same
community
and
members
of
the
same
religious
denomination
you
were
generous
enough
to
give
me
credit
for
sincerity
as
a
christian
though
you
believed
i
had
been
most
strangely
deceived
i
thanked
you
then
for
your
kindness
and
i
ask
you
for
the
sake
of
former
confidence
and
former
friendship
to
read
the
following
pages
in
the
spirit
of
calm
investigation
and
fervent
prayer
it
is
because
you
have
known
me
that
i
write
thus
unto
you
but
there
are
other
christian
women
scattered
over
the
southern
states
and
of
these
a
very
large
number
have
never
seen
me
and
never
heard
my
name
and
feel
personal
interest
whatever
in
but
i
feel
an
interest
in
as
branches
of
the
same
vine
from
whose
root
i
daily
draw
the
principle
of
spiritual
vitality
yes
sisters
in
christ
i
feel
an
interest
in
and
often
has
the
secret
prayer
arisen
on
your
behalf
lord
open
thou
their
eyes
that
they
may
see
wondrous
things
out
of
thy
law
it
is
then
because
i
and
for
you
that
i
thus
address
you
upon
a
subject
about
which
of
all
others
perhaps
you
would
rather
not
hear
any
thing
but
would
to
god
ye
could
bear
with
me
a
little
in
my
folly
and
indeed
bear
with
me
for
i
am
jealous
over
you
with
godly
jealousy
be
not
afraid
then
to
read
my
appeal
it
is
written
in
the
heat
of
passion
or
prejudice
but
in
that
solemn
calmness
which
is
the
result
of
conviction
and
duty
it
is
true
i
am
going
to
tell
you
unwelcome
truths
but
i
mean
to
speak
those
in
and
remember
solomon

faithful
are
the
of
a
friend
i
do
not
believe
the
time
has
yet
come
when
will
not
endure
sound
doctrine
even
on
the
subject
of
slavery
if
it
is
spoken
to
them
in
tenderness
and
love
therefore

please
read
and
circulate
to
all
of

or
unknown
relatives
or
strangers
for
you
are
all
to
christ
i
would
speak
i
have
felt
for
you
at
this
time
when
unwelcome
light
is
pouring
in
upon
the
world
on
the
subject
of
slavery
light
which
even
christians
would
exclude
if
they
could
from
our
country
or
at
any
rate
from
the
southern
portion
of
it
saying
as
its
rays
strike
the
rock
bound
coasts
of
new
england
and
scatter
their
warmth
and
radiance
over
her
hills
and
valleys
and
from
thence
travel
onward
over
the
palisades
of
the
hudson
and
down
the
soft
flowing
waters
of
the
delaware
and
gild
the
waves
of
the
potomac
hitherto
shalt
thou
come
and
no
further
i
know
that
even
professors
of
his
name
who
has
been
emphatically
called
the
light
of
the
world
would
if
they
could
build
a
wall
of
adamant
around
the
southern
states
whose
top
might
reach
unto
heaven
in
order
to
shut
out
the
light
which
is
bounding
from
mountain
to
mountain
and
from
the
hills
to
the
plains
and
valleys
beneath
through
the
vast
extent
of
our
northern
states
but
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
their
attempts
will
be
as
utterly
fruitless
as
were
the
efforts
of
the
builders
of
babel
and
why
because
moral
like
natural
light
is
so
extremely
subtle
in
its
nature
as
to
overleap
all
human
barriers
and
laugh
at
the
puny
efforts
of
man
to
control
it
all
the
excuses
and
palliations
of
this
system
must
inevitably
be
swept
away
just
as
other
refuges
of
lies
have
been
by
the
irresistible
torrent
of
a
rectified
public
opinion
the
of
the
slave
system
says
jonathan
dymond
in
his
admirable
work
on
the
principles
of
morality
will
be
regarded
with
the
public
feeling
as
he
who
was
an
advocate
for
the
slave
trade
it
will
be
and
that
very
soon
clearly
perceived
and
fully
acknowledged
by
all
the
virtuous
and
the
candid
that
in
it
is
as
sinful
to
hold
a
human
being
in
bondage
who
has
been
born
in
carolina
as
one
who
has
been
born
in
africa
all
that
sophistry
of
argument
which
has
been
employed
to
prove
that
although
it
is
sinful
to
send
to
africa
to
procure
men
and
women
as
slaves
who
have
never
been
in
slavery
that
still
it
is
not
sinful
to
keep
those
in
bondage
who
have
come
down
by
inheritance
will
be
utterly
overthrown
we
must
come
back
to
the
good
old
doctrine
of
our
forefathers
who
declared
to
the
world
this
self
evident
truth
that
men
are
created
equal
and
that
they
have
certain
rights
among
which
are
life
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
it
is
even
a
greater
absurdity
to
suppose
a
man
can
be
legally
born
a
slave
under
free
government
than
under
the
petty
despotisms
of
barbarian
africa
if
then
we
have
no
right
to
enslave
an
african
surely
we
can
have
none
to
enslave
an
american
if
it
is
a
self
evident
truth
that
men
every
where
and
of
every
color
are
born
equal
and
have
an
right
to
then
it
is
equally
true
that
man
can
be
born
a
slave
and
no
man
can
ever
be
reduced
to
bondage
and
held
as
a
slave
however
fair
may
be
the
claim
of
his
master
or
mistress
through
wills
and
but
after
all
it
may
be
said
our
fathers
were
certainly
mistaken
for
the
bible
sanctions
slavery
and
that
is
the
highest
authority
now
the
bible
is
my
ultimate
appeal
in
all
matters
of
faith
and
practice
and
it
is
to
i
am
anxious
to
bring
the
subject
at
issue
between
us
let
us
then
begin
with
adam
and
examine
the
charter
of
privileges
which
was
given
to
him
have
dominion
over
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
over
the
fowl
of
the
air
and
over
every
living
thing
that
moveth
upon
the
earth
in
the
eighth
psalm
we
have
a
still
fuller
description
of
this
charter
which
through
adam
was
given
to
all
mankind
thou
madest
him
to
have
dominion
over
the
works
of
thy
hands
thou
hast
put
all
things
under
his
feet
all
sheep
and
oxen
yea
and
the
beasts
of
the
field
the
fowl
of
the
air
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
whatsoever
passeth
through
the
paths
of
the
seas
and
after
the
flood
when
this
charter
of
human
rights
was
renewed
we
find
power
vested
in
man
and
the
fear
of
you
and
the
dread
of
you
shall
be
upon
every
beast
of
the
earth
and
every
fowl
of
the
air
and
upon
all
that
moveth
upon
the
earth
and
upon
all
the
fishes
of
the
sea
into
your
hand
are
they
delivered
in
this
charter
although
the
different
kinds
of
beings
are
so
particularly
enumerated
and
supreme
dominion
over
of
is
granted
yet
is
vested
with
this
dominion
his
fellow
man
he
was
never
told
that
any
of
the
human
species
were
put
his
feet
it
was
only
and
man
who
was
created
in
the
image
of
his
maker
can
properly
be
termed
a
though
the
laws
of
slave
states
do
call
him
a
chattel
personal
then
i
assert
was
put
the
feet
of
by
that
first
charter
of
human
rights
which
was
given
by
god
to
the
fathers
of
the
antediluvian
and
postdiluvian
worlds
therefore
this
doctrine
of
equality
is
based
on
the
bible
but
it
may
be
argued
that
in
the
very
chapter
of
genesis
from
which
i
have
last
quoted
will
be
found
the
curse
pronounced
upon
canaan
by
which
his
posterity
was
consigned
to
servitude
under
his
brothers
shem
and
japheth
i
know
this
prophecy
was
uttered
and
was
most
fearfully
and
wonderfully
fulfilled
through
the
immediate
descendants
of
canaan
the
canaanites
and
i
do
not
know
but
it
has
been
through
all
the
children
of
ham
but
i
do
know
that
prophecy
does
tell
us
what
to
but
what
actually
does
take
place
ages
after
it
has
been
delivered
and
that
if
we
justify
america
for
enslaving
the
children
of
africa
we
must
also
justify
egypt
for
reducing
the
children
of
israel
to
bondage
for
the
latter
was
foretold
as
explicitly
as
the
former
i
am
well
aware
that
prophecy
has
often
been
urged
as
an
excuse
for
slavery
but
be
not
deceived
the
fulfillment
of
prophecy
will
cover
one
in
the
awful
day
of
account
hear
what
our
saviour
says
on
this
subject
it
must
needs
be
that
offences
come
but
unto
that
man
through
whom
they
witness
some
fulfillment
of
this
declaration
in
the
tremendous
destruction
of
jerusalem
occasioned
by
that
most
nefarious
of
all
crimes
the
crucifixion
of
the
son
of
god
did
the
fact
of
that
event
having
been
foretold
exculpate
the
jews
from
sin
in
perpetrating
it
no
for
hear
what
the
apostle
peter
says
to
them
on
this
subject
him
being
delivered
by
the
determinate
counsel
and
foreknowledge
of
god
have
taken
and
by
hands
have
crucified
and
slain
other
striking
instances
might
be
adduced
but
these
will
suffice
but
it
has
been
urged
that
the
patriarchs
held
slaves
and
therefore
slavery
is
right
do
you
really
believe
that
patriarchal
servitude
was
like
american
slavery
can
you
believe
it
if
so
read
the
history
of
these
primitive
fathers
of
the
church
and
be
undeceived
look
at
abraham
though
so
great
a
man
going
to
the
herd
himself
and
fetching
a
calf
from
thence
and
serving
it
up
with
his
own
hands
for
the
entertainment
of
his
guests
look
at
sarah
that
princess
as
her
name
signifies
baking
cakes
upon
the
hearth
if
the
servants
they
had
were
like
southern
slaves
would
they
have
performed
such
comparatively
menial
offices
for
themselves
hear
too
the
plaintive
lamentation
of
abraham
when
he
feared
he
should
have
no
son
to
bear
his
name
down
to
posterity
behold
thou
hast
given
me
no
seed
one
born
in
my
house
heir
from
this
it
appears
that
one
of
his
was
to
inherit
his
immense
estate
is
this
like
southern
slavery
i
leave
it
to
your
own
good
sense
and
candor
to
decide
besides
such
was
the
footing
upon
which
abraham
was
with
servants
that
he
trusted
them
with
arms
are
slaveholders
willing
to
put
swords
and
pistols
into
the
hands
of
their
slaves
he
was
as
a
father
among
his
servants
what
are
planters
and
masters
generally
among
theirs
when
the
institution
of
circumcision
was
established
abraham
was
commanded
thus
he
that
is
eight
days
old
shall
be
circumcised
among
you
in
your
generations
he
that
is
born
in
the
house
or
bought
with
money
of
any
stranger
which
is
not
of
thy
seed
and
to
render
this
command
with
regard
to
his
still
more
impressive
it
is
repeated
in
the
very
next
verse
and
herein
we
may
perceive
the
great
care
which
was
taken
by
god
to
guard
the
of
even
under
this
dark
dispensation
what
too
was
the
testimony
given
to
the
faithfulness
of
this
eminent
patriarch
for
i
know
him
that
he
will
command
his
children
and
his
after
him
and
they
shall
keep
the
way
of
the
lord
to
do
justice
and
judgment
now
my
dear
friends
many
of
you
believe
that
circumcision
has
been
superseded
by
baptism
in
the
church
careful
to
have
that
are
born
in
your
house
or
bought
with
money
of
any
stranger
baptized
are
as
faithful
as
abraham
to
command
household
to
keep
the
way
of
the
lord
i
leave
it
to
your
own
consciences
to
decide
was
patriarchal
servitude
then
like
american
slavery
but
i
shall
be
told
god
sanctioned
slavery
yea
commanded
slavery
under
the
jewish
dispensation
let
us
examine
this
subject
calmly
and
prayerfully
i
admit
that
a
species
of
was
permitted
to
the
jews
but
in
studying
the
subject
i
have
been
struck
with
wonder
and
admiration
at
perceiving
how
carefully
the
servant
was
guarded
from
violence
injustice
and
wrong
i
will
first
inform
you
how
these
servants
became
servants
for
i
think
this
a
very
important
part
of
our
subject
from
consulting
horne
calmet
and
the
bible
i
find
there
were
six
different
ways
by
which
the
hebrews
became
servants
legally
if
reduced
to
extreme
poverty
a
hebrew
might
sell
himself
his
services
for
six
years
in
which
case
received
the
purchase
money
lev
xxv
a
father
might
sell
his
children
as
servants
his
in
which
circumstance
it
was
understood
the
daughter
was
to
be
the
wife
or
of
the
man
who
bought
her
and
the
received
the
price
in
other
words
jewish
women
were
sold
as
were
in
the
first
settlement
of
virginia
as
as
slaves
ex
xxi
insolvent
debtors
might
be
delivered
to
their
creditors
as
servants
kings
iv
thieves
not
able
to
make
restitution
for
their
thefts
were
sold
for
the
benefit
of
the
injured
person
ex
xxii
they
might
be
born
in
servitude
ex
xxi
if
a
hebrew
had
sold
himself
to
a
rich
gentile
he
might
be
redeemed
by
one
of
his
brethren
at
any
time
the
money
was
offered
and
he
who
redeemed
him
was
to
take
advantage
of
the
favor
thus
conferred
and
rule
over
him
with
rigor
lev
xxv
before
going
into
an
examination
of
the
laws
by
which
these
servants
were
protected
i
would
just
ask
whether
american
slaves
have
become
slaves
in
any
of
the
ways
in
which
the
hebrews
became
servants
did
they
sell
themselves
into
slavery
and
receive
the
purchase
money
into
their
own
hands
no
did
they
become
insolvent
and
by
their
own
imprudence
subject
themselves
to
be
sold
as
slaves
no
did
they
steal
the
property
of
another
and
were
they
sold
to
make
restitution
for
their
crimes
no
did
their
present
masters
as
an
act
of
kindness
redeem
them
from
some
heathen
tyrant
to
whom
had
sold
in
the
dark
hour
of
adversity
no
were
they
born
in
slavery
no
no
not
according
to
for
the
servants
who
were
born
in
servitude
among
them
were
born
of
parents
who
had
for
six
years
ex
xxi
were
the
female
slaves
of
the
south
sold
by
their
fathers
how
shall
i
answer
this
question
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
never
were
fathers
have
received
the
poor
compensation
of
silver
or
gold
for
the
tears
and
toils
the
suffering
and
anguish
and
hopeless
bondage
of
daughters
they
labor
day
by
day
and
year
by
year
side
by
side
in
the
same
field
if
haply
their
daughters
are
permitted
to
remain
on
the
same
plantation
with
them
instead
of
being
as
they
often
are
separated
from
their
parents
and
sold
into
distant
states
never
again
to
meet
on
earth
but
do
the
of
the
south
ever
sell
their
daughters
my
heart
beats
and
my
hand
trembles
as
i
write
the
awful
affirmative
yes
the
fathers
of
this
christian
land
often
sell
their
daughters
as
jewish
parents
did
to
be
the
wives
and
of
the
man
who
buys
them
but
to
be
the
abject
slaves
of
petty
tyrants
and
irresponsible
masters
is
it
not
so
my
friends
i
leave
it
to
your
own
candor
to
corroborate
my
assertion
southern
slaves
then
have
become
slaves
in
any
of
the
six
different
ways
in
which
hebrews
became
servants
and
i
hesitate
not
to
say
that
american
masters
according
to
substantiate
their
claim
to
the
men
women
or
children
they
now
hold
in
bondage
but
there
was
one
way
in
which
a
jew
might
illegally
be
reduced
to
servitude
it
was
this
he
might
he
and
afterwards
sold
as
a
slave
as
was
joseph
to
guard
most
effectually
against
this
dreadful
crime
of
manstealing
god
enacted
this
severe
law
he
that
stealeth
a
man
and
selleth
him
or
if
he
be
found
in
his
hand
he
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
a
as
i
have
tried
american
slavery
by
hebrew
servitude
and
found
to
your
surprise
perhaps
that
jewish
law
can
not
justify
the
slaveholder
claim
let
us
now
try
it
by
hebrew
bondage
have
the
southern
slaves
then
been
stolen
if
they
did
not
sell
themselves
into
bondage
if
they
were
not
sold
as
insolvent
debtors
or
as
thieves
if
they
were
not
redeemed
from
a
heathen
master
to
whom
they
had
sold
themselves
if
they
were
not
born
in
servitude
according
to
hebrew
law
and
if
the
females
were
not
sold
by
their
fathers
as
wives
and
to
those
who
purchased
them
then
what
shall
we
say
of
them
what
can
we
say
of
them
but
that
according
hebrew
law
they
have
been
footnote
a
and
again
if
a
man
be
found
stealing
any
of
his
brethren
of
the
children
of
israel
and
maketh
merchandise
of
him
or
selleth
him
then
thief
shall
and
thou
shalt
put
away
evil
from
among
you
deut
xxiv
but
i
shall
be
told
that
the
jews
had
other
servants
who
were
absolute
slaves
let
us
look
a
little
into
this
also
they
had
other
servants
who
were
procured
in
two
different
ways
captives
taken
in
war
were
reduced
to
bondage
instead
of
being
killed
but
we
are
not
told
that
their
children
were
enslaved
deut
xx
bondmen
and
bondmaids
might
be
bought
from
the
heathen
round
about
them
these
were
left
by
fathers
to
their
children
after
them
but
it
does
not
appear
that
the
of
these
servants
ever
were
reduced
to
servitude
lev
xxv
i
will
now
try
the
right
of
the
southern
planter
by
the
claims
of
hebrew
masters
over
their
slaves
were
the
southern
slaves
taken
captive
in
war
no
were
they
bought
from
the
heathen
no
for
surely
no
one
will
vindicate
the
so
far
as
to
assert
that
slaves
were
bought
from
the
heathen
who
were
obtained
by
that
system
of
piracy
the
only
excuse
for
holding
southern
slaves
is
that
they
were
born
in
slavery
but
we
have
seen
that
they
were
born
in
servitude
as
jewish
servants
were
and
that
the
children
of
heathen
slaves
were
not
legally
subjected
to
bondage
even
under
the
mosaic
law
how
then
have
the
slaves
of
the
south
been
obtained
i
will
next
proceed
to
an
examination
of
those
laws
which
were
enacted
in
order
to
protect
the
hebrew
and
the
heathen
servant
for
i
wish
you
to
understand
that
are
protected
by
him
of
whom
it
is
said
his
mercies
are
over
all
his
works
i
will
first
speak
of
those
which
secured
the
rights
of
hebrew
servants
this
code
was
headed
thus
thou
shalt
not
rule
over
him
with
rigor
but
shalt
fear
thy
god
if
thou
buy
a
hebrew
servant
six
years
shall
he
serve
and
in
the
seventh
year
he
shall
go
out
free
for
nothing
ex
xx
a
footnote
a
and
when
thou
sendest
him
out
free
from
thee
thou
shalt
not
let
him
go
away
empty
thou
shalt
furnish
him
out
of
thy
flock
and
out
of
thy
floor
and
out
of
thy
of
that
wherewith
the
lord
thy
god
hath
blessed
thee
shalt
thou
give
unto
him
deut
xv
if
he
come
in
by
himself
he
shall
go
out
by
himself
if
he
were
married
then
his
wife
shall
go
out
with
him
if
his
master
have
given
him
a
wife
and
she
have
borne
him
sons
and
daughters
the
wife
and
her
children
shall
be
his
master
and
he
shall
go
out
by
himself
if
the
servant
shall
plainly
say
i
love
my
master
my
wife
and
my
children
i
will
not
go
out
free
then
his
master
shall
bring
him
unto
the
judges
and
he
shall
bring
him
to
the
door
or
unto
the
and
his
master
shall
bore
his
ear
through
with
an
awl
and
he
shall
serve
him
ex
xxi
if
a
man
smite
the
eye
of
his
servant
or
the
eye
of
his
maid
that
it
perish

ex

on
the
sabbath
rest
was
secured
to
servants
by
the
fourth
commandment
ex

servants
were
permitted
to
unite
with
their
masters
three
times
in
every
year
in
celebrating
the
passover
the
feast
of
pentecost
and
the
feast
of
tabernacles
every
male
throughout
the
land
was
to
appear
before
the
lord
at
jerusalem
with
a
gift

and
the
free

smite

punished
notwithstanding
if
he
continue
a
day
or
two
he
shall
not
be
punished
for
he
is
his
money
ex
xxi
from
these
laws
we
learn
that
hebrew
men
servants
were
bound
to
serve
their
masters
years
unless
their
attachment
to
their
employers
their
wives
and
children
should
induce
them
to
wish
to
remain
in
servitude
in
which
case
in
order
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
deception
on
the
part
of
the
master
the
servant
was
first
taken
before
the
magistrate
where
he
openly
declared
his
intention
of
continuing
in
his
master
service
probably
a
public
register
was
kept
of
such
he
was
then
conducted
to
the
door
of
the
house
in
warm
climates
doors
are
thrown
open
and
his
ear
was
bored
and
by
submitting
to
this
operation
he
testified
his
willingness
to
serve
him
during
his
life
for
jewish
rabbins
who
must
have
understood
jewish
as
it
is
called
affirm
that
servants
were
set
free
at
the
death
of
their
masters
and
did
descend
to
their
heirs
or
that
he
was
to
serve
him
until
the
year
of
jubilee
when
servants
were
set
at
liberty
to
protect
servants
from
violence
it
was
ordained
that
if
a
master
struck
out
the
tooth
or
destroyed
the
eye
of
a
servant
that
servant
immediately
became
for
such
an
act
of
violence
evidently
showed
he
was
unfit
to
possess
the
power
of
a
master
and
therefore
that
power
was
taken
from
him
all
servants
enjoyed
the
rest
of
the
sabbath
and
partook
of
the
privileges
and
festivities
of
the
three
great
jewish
feasts
and
if
a
servant
died
under
the
infliction
of
chastisement
his
master
was
surely
to
be
punished
as
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
and
life
for
life
was
the
jewish
law
of
course
he
was
punished
with
death
i
know
that
great
stress
has
been
laid
upon
the
following
verse
notwithstanding
if
he
continue
a
day
or
two
he
shall
not
be
punished
for
he
is
his
money
slaveholders
and
the
apologists
of
slavery
have
eagerly
seized
upon
this
little
passage
of
scripture
and
held
it
up
as
the
masters
magna
charta
by
which
they
were
licensed
by
god
himself
to
commit
the
greatest
outrages
upon
the
defenceless
victims
of
their
oppression
but
my
friends
was
it
designed
to
be
so
if
our
heavenly
father
would
protect
by
law
the
eye
and
the
tooth
of
a
hebrew
servant
can
we
for
a
moment
believe
that
he
would
abandon
that
same
servant
to
the
brutal
rape
of
a
master
who
would
destroy
even
life
itself
do
we
not
rather
see
in
this
the
law
which
protected
masters
and
was
it
not
right
that
in
case
of
the
death
of
a
servant
one
or
two
days
after
chastisement
was
inflicted
to
which
other
circumstances
might
have
contributed
that
the
master
should
be
protected
when
in
all
probability
he
never
intended
to
produce
so
fatal
a
result
but
the
phrase
he
is
his
money
has
been
adduced
to
show
that
hebrew
servants
were
regarded
as
mere
chattels
personal
if
so
why
were
so
many
laws
made
to
their
rights
as
and
to
ensure
their
rising
into
equality
and
freedom
if
they
were
mere
why
were
they
regarded
as
responsible
beings
and
one
law
made
for
them
as
well
as
for
their
masters
but
i
pass
on
now
to
the
consideration
of
how
the
jewish
servants
were
protected
by
if
she
please
not
her
master
who
hath
betrothed
her
to
himself
then
shall
he
let
her
be
redeemed
to
sell
her
unto
another
nation
he
shall
have
no
power
seeing
he
hath
dealt
deceitfully
with
her
if
he
have
betrothed
her
unto
his
son
he
shall
deal
with
her
after
the
manner
of
daughters
if
he
take
him
another
wife
her
food
her
raiment
and
her
duty
of
marriage
shall
he
not
diminish
if
he
do
not
these
three
unto
her
then
shall
she
go
out
without
money
on
these
laws
i
will
give
you
calmet
remarks
a
father
could
not
sell
his
daughter
as
a
slave
according
to
the
rabbins
until
she
was
at
the
age
of
puberty
and
unless
he
were
reduced
to
the
utmost
indigence
besides
when
a
master
bought
an
israelitish
girl
it
was
with
the
presumption
that
he
would
take
her
to
wife
hence
moses
adds
if
she
please
not
her
master
and
he
does
not
think
fit
to
marry
her
he
shall
set
her
at
liberty
or
according
to
the
hebrew
he
shall
let
her
be
redeemed
to
sell
her
to
another
nation
he
shall
have
no
power
seeing
he
hath
dealt
deceitfully
with
her
as
to
the
engagement
implied
at
least
of
taking
her
to
wife
if
he
have
betrothed
her
unto
his
son
he
shall
deal
with
her
after
the
manner
of
daughters
he
shall
take
care
that
his
son
uses
her
as
his
wife
that
he
does
not
despise
or
maltreat
her
if
he
make
his
son
marry
another
wife
he
shall
give
her
her
dowry
her
clothes
and
compensation
for
her
virginity
if
he
does
none
of
these
three
she
shall
out
without
money
thus
were
the
of
female
servants
carefully
secured
by
under
the
jewish
dispensation
and
now
i
would
ask
are
the
rights
of
female
slaves
at
the
south
thus
secured
are
sold
only
as
wives
and
and
when
not
treated
as
such
are
they
allowed
to
out
no
they
have
not
only
been
illegally
obtained
as
servants
according
to
hebrew
law
but
they
are
also
illegally
in
bondage
masters
at
the
south
and
west
have
all
forfeited
their
claims
they
ever
had
to
their
female
slaves
we
come
now
to
examine
the
case
of
those
servants
who
were
of
the
heathen
round
about
were
left
entirely
unprotected
by
law
horne
in
speaking
of
the
law
thou
shalt
not
rule
over
him
with
rigor
but
shalt
fear
thy
god
remarks
this
law
lev
xxv
it
is
true
speaks
expressly
of
slaves
who
were
of
hebrew
descent
but
as
slaves
were
ingrafted
into
the
hebrew
church
by
circumcision
is
no
but
that
it
applied
to
slaves
if
so
then
we
may
reasonably
suppose
that
the
other
protective
laws
extended
to
them
also
and
that
the
only
difference
between
hebrew
and
heathen
servants
lay
in
this
that
the
former
served
but
six
years
unless
they
chose
to
remain
longer
and
were
always
freed
at
the
death
of
their
masters
whereas
the
latter
served
until
the
year
of
jubilee
though
that
might
include
a
period
of
years
and
were
left
from
father
to
son
there
are
however
two
other
laws
which
i
have
not
yet
noticed
the
one
effectually
prevented
servitude
and
the
other
completely
abolished
jewish
servitude
every
fifty
years
they
were
equally
operative
upon
the
heathen
and
the
hebrew
thou
shall
deliver
unto
his
master
the
servant
that
is
escaped
from
his
master
unto
thee
he
shall
dwell
with
thee
even
among
you
in
that
place
which
he
shall
choose
in
one
of
thy
gates
where
it
liketh
him
best
thou
shall
oppress
him
deut
xxxiii
and
ye
shall
hallow
the
fiftieth
year
and
proclaim
throughout
the
land
unto
the
inhabitants
thereof
it
shall
be
a
jubilee
unto
you
deut
xxv
here
then
we
see
that
by
this
first
law
the
of
freedom
was
opened
wide
to
every
servant
had
any
cause
whatever
for
complaint
if
he
was
unhappy
with
his
master
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
leave
him
and
had
a
right
to
deliver
him
back
to
him
again
and
not
only
so
but
the
absconded
servant
was
to
where
he
should
live
and
no
jew
was
permitted
to
oppress
him
he
left
his
master
just
as
our
northern
servants
leave
us
we
have
no
power
to
compel
them
to
remain
with
us
and
no
man
has
any
right
to
oppress
them
they
go
and
dwell
in
that
place
where
it
chooseth
them
and
live
just
where
they
like
is
it
so
at
the
south
is
the
poor
runaway
slave
protected
from
the
violence
of
that
master
whose
oppression
and
cruelty
has
driven
him
from
his
plantation
or
his
house
no
no
even
the
free
states
of
the
north
are
compelled
to
deliver
unto
his
master
the
servant
that
is
escaped
from
his
master
into
them
by
law
under
the
in
the
we
are
commanded
to
do
what
more
than
years
ago
under
the
the
jews
to
do
in
the
wide
domain
even
of
our
free
states
there
is
not
city
of
refuge
for
the
poor
runaway
fugitive
not
one
spot
upon
which
he
can
stand
and
say
i
am
a
free
man
i
am
protected
in
my
rights
as
a
by
the
strong
arm
of
the
law
no
how
long
the
north
will
thus
shake
hands
with
the
south
in
sin
i
know
not
how
long
she
will
stand
by
like
the
persecutor
saul
unto
the
death
of
stephen
and
keeping
the
raiment
of
them
that
slew
him
i
know
not
but
one
thing
i
do
know
the
of
the
is
increasing
in
a
tremendous
ratio
as
light
is
pouring
in
upon
her
on
the
subject
and
the
sin
of
slavery
as
the
sun
of
righteousness
climbs
higher
and
higher
in
the
moral
heavens
she
will
stand
still
more
and
more
abashed
as
the
query
is
thundered
down
into
her
ear
hath
required
at
thy
hand
it
will
be
found
excuse
then
that
the
constitution
of
our
country
required
that
bound
to
escaping
from
their
masters
should
be
delivered
up
no
more
excuse
than
was
the
reason
which
adam
assigned
for
eating
the
forbidden
fruit
was
condemned
and
punished
he
hearkened
to
the
voice
of
rather
than
to
the
command
of
his
maker
and
will
assuredly
be
condemned
and
punished
for
obeying
rather
than
if
we
do
not
speedily
repent
and
bring
forth
fruits
meet
for
repentance
yea
are
we
not
receiving
chastisement
even
but
by
the
second
of
these
laws
a
still
more
astonishing
fact
is
disclosed
if
the
first
effectually
prevented
involuntary
the
last
absolutely
forbade
even
servitude
being
on
the
great
day
of
atonement
every
fiftieth
year
the
jubilee
trumpet
was
sounded
throughout
the
land
of
judea
and
was
proclaimed
to
the
inhabitants
thereof
i
will
not
say
that
the
servants
fell
off
and
their
were
burst
for
there
is
no
evidence
that
jewish
servants
felt
the
weight
of
iron
chains
and
collars
and
handcuffs
but
i
do
say
that
even
the
man
who
had
voluntarily
sold
himself
and
the
who
had
been
sold
to
a
hebrew
master
were
set
free
the
one
as
well
as
the
other
this
law
was
evidently
designed
to
prevent
the
oppression
of
the
poor
and
the
possibility
of
such
a
thing
as
existing
among
them
where
then
i
would
ask
is
the
warrant
the
justification
or
the
palliation
of
american
slavery
from
hebrew
servitude
how
many
of
the
southern
slaves
would
now
be
in
bondage
according
to
the
laws
of
moses
not
one
you
may
observe
that
i
have
carefully
avoided
using
the
term
when
speaking
of
jewish
servitude
and
simply
for
this
reason
that
such
existed
among
that
people
the
word
translated
servant
does
mean
it
is
the
same
that
is
applied
to
abraham
to
moses
to
elisha
and
the
prophets
generally
then
existed
under
the
jewish
dispensation
at
all
and
i
can
not
but
regard
it
as
an
aspersion
on
the
character
of
him
who
is
glorious
in
holiness
for
any
one
to
assert
that
sanctioned
yea
commanded
under
the
old
dispensation
i
would
fain
lift
my
feeble
voice
to
vindicate
jehovah
character
from
so
foul
a
slander
if
slaveholders
are
determined
to
hold
slaves
as
long
as
they
can
let
them
not
dare
to
say
that
the
god
of
mercy
and
of
truth
sanctioned
such
a
system
of
cruelty
and
wrong
it
is
blasphemy
against
him
we
have
seen
that
the
code
of
laws
framed
by
moses
with
regard
to
servants
was
designed
to
as
and
to
secure
to
them
their
as
to
guard
them
from
oppression
and
defend
them
from
violence
of
every
kind
let
us
now
turn
to
the
slave
laws
of
the
south
and
west
and
examine
them
too
i
will
give
you
the
substance

because
i
fear
i
shall
trespass
too
much
on
your

to

them
at

hereditary
and
perpetual
to
the
last
moment
of
the
slave
earthly
existence
and
to
all
his
descendants
to
the
latest
posterity
the
labor
of
the
slave
is
compulsory
and
uncompensated
while
the
kind
of
labor
the
amount
of
toil
the
time
allowed
for
rest
are
dictated
solely
by
the
master
no
bargain
is
made
no
wages
given
a
pure
despotism
governs
the
human
brute
and
even
his
covering
and
provender
both
as
to
quantity
and
quality
depend
entirely
on
the
master
discretion
a
footnote
a
there
are
laws
in
some
of
the
slave
states
limiting
the
labor
which
the
master
may
require
of
the
slave
to
fourteen
hours
daily
in
some
of
the
states
there
are
laws
requiring
the
masters
to
furnish
a
certain
amount
of
food
and
clothing
as
for
instance
of
corn
per
day
or
per
week
or
per
month
and
one
linen
shirt
and
pantaloons
for
the
summer
and
a
linen
shirt
and
woolen
great
coat
and
pantaloons
for
the
winter
but
still
to
use
the
language
of
judge
stroud
the
slave
is
entirely
under
the
control
of
his
master
is
unprovided
with
a
protector
and
especially
as
he
can
not
be
a

or
make
complaint
in
any

mode
against
his

the

the

in

two
systems
i
ask
you
rather
to
mark
the
contrast
the
laws
of
moses
in
their
as
men
and
guarded
them
from
oppression
and
defended
them
from

the

mercy
are
shadowed
out
in

hebrew
code
those
of
injustice

cruelty
in
the
code

of

truly
it
was
wise
in
the
slaveholders
of
the
south
to
declare
their
slaves
to
be
chattels
personal
for
before
they
could
be
robbed
of
wages
wives
children
and
friends
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
deny
they
were
human
beings
it
is
wise
in
them
to
keep
them
in
abject
ignorance
for
the

it

feet

the
almighty
and
beneficent
father
of
all
who
has
declared
himself
to
be
of
persons
whether
red
white

black
but
some
have
even
said
that
jesus
christ
did
not
condemn
slavery
to
this
i
reply
that
our
holy
redeemer
lived
and
preached
among
the
jews
only
the
laws
which
moses
had
enacted
fifteen
hundred
years
previous
to
his
appearance
among
them
had
never
been
annulled
and
these
laws
every
servant
in
palestine
that
he
saw
nothing
of
servitude
is
certain
from
the
simple
declaration
made
by
himself
in
john
viii
the
servant
abideth
in
the
house
for
ever
the
son
abideth
ever
if
then
he
did
not
condemn
jewish
servitude
this
does
not
prove
that
he
would
not
have
condemned
such
a
monstrous
system
as
that
of
american
if
that
had
existed
among

did
not

slaveholders
have
said
we
were
never
in
bondage
to
any
man
and
therefore
the
yoke
of
bondage
would
be
insufferable
to
us
but
slaves
are
accustomed
to
it
their
backs
are
fitted
to
the
burden
well
i
am
willing
to
admit
that
you
who
have
lived
in
freedom
would
find
slavery
even
more
oppressive
than
the
poor
slave
does
but
then
you
may
try
this
question
in
another
form
am
i
willing
to
reduce
little
to
slavery
you
know
that
it
is
brought
up
a
it
will
never
know
any
contrast
between
freedom
and
bondage
its
back
will
become
fitted
to
the
burden
just
as
the
negro
child
does
by
but
by
daily
violent
pressure
in
the
same
way
that
the
head
of
the
indian
child
becomes
flattened
by
the
boards
in
which
it
is
bound
it
has
been
justly
remarked
that
never
made
a
he
made
man
upright
his
back
was
made
to
carry
burdens
as
the
slave
of
another
nor
his
neck
to
wear
a
yoke
and
the
must
be
crushed
within
him
before
back
can
be
to
the
burden
of
perpetual
slavery
and
that
his
back
is
fitted
to
it
is
manifest
by
the
insurrections
that
so
often
disturb
the
peace
and
security
of
countries
who
ever
heard
of
a
rebellion
of
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
why
not
simply
because
were
all
placed
the
feet
of
into
whose
hand
they
were
delivered
it
was
originally
designed
that
they
should
serve
him
therefore
their
necks
have
been
formed
for
the
yoke
and
their
backs
for
the
burden
but
so
with
intellectual
immortal
man
i
appeal
to
you
my
friends
as
mothers
are
you
willing
to
enslave
children
you
start
back
with
horror
and
indignation
at
such
a
question
but
why
if
slavery
is
to
those
upon
whom
it
is
imposed
why
if
as
has
often
been
said
slaves
are
happier
than
their
masters
freer
from
the
cares
and
perplexities
of
providing
for
themselves
and
their
families
why
not
place
in
the
way
of
being
supported
without
your
having
the
trouble
to
provide
for
them
or
they
for
themselves
do
you
not
perceive
that
as
soon
as
this
golden
rule
of
action
is
applied
to
that
you
involuntarily
shrink
from
the
test
as
soon
as
actions
are
weighed
in
balance
of
the
sanctuary
that
are
found
wanting
try
yourselves
by
another
of
the
divine
precepts
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbor
as
thyself
can
we
love
a
man
we
love
if
we
do
and
continue
to
do
unto
him
what
we
would
not
wish
any
one
to
do
to
us
look
too
at
christ
example
what
does
he
say
of
himself
i
came
to
be
ministered
unto
but
to
minister
can
you
for
a
moment
imagine
the
meek
and
lowly
and
compassionate
saviour
a
do
you
not
shudder
at
this
thought
as
much
as
at
that
of
his
being
a
but
why
if
slavery
is
not
sinful
again
it
has
been
said
the
apostle
paul
did
not
condemn
slavery
for
he
sent
onesimus
back
to
philemon
i
do
not
think
it
can
be
said
he
sent
him
back
for
no
coercion
was
made
use
of
onesimus
was
not
thrown
into
prison
and
then
sent
back
in
chains
to
his
master
as
your
runaway
slaves
often
are
this
could
not
possibly
have
been
the
case
because
you
know
paul
as
a
jew
was
to
the
runaway
had
no
to
send
any
fugitive
back
to
his
master
the
state
of
the
case
then
seems
to
have
been
this
onesimus
had
been
an
unprofitable
servant
to
philemon
and
left
him
he
afterwards
became
converted
under
the
apostle
preaching
and
seeing
that
he
had
been
to
blame
in
his
conduct
and
desiring
by
future
fidelity
to
atone
for
past
error
he
wished
to
return
and
the
apostle
gave
him
the
letter
we
now
have
as
a
recommendation
to
philemon
informing
him
of
the
conversion
of
onesimus
and
entreating
him
as
paul
the
aged
to
receive
him
now
as
a
but
a
servant
a
brother
beloved
especially
to
me
but
how
much
more
unto
thee
both
in
the
flesh
and
in
the
lord
if
thou
count
therefore
as
a
partner
him
as
this
then
surely
can
not
be
forced
into
a
justification
of
the
practice
of
returning
runaway
slaves
back
to
their
masters
to
be
punished
with
cruel
beatings
and
scourgings
as
they
often
are
besides
the
word
greek
doulos
here
translated
servant
is
the
same
that
is
made
use
of
in
matt
xviii
now
it
appears
that
this
servant
owed
his
lord
ten
thousand
talents
he
possessed
property
to
a
vast
amount
onesimus
could
not
then
have
been
a
for
slaves
do
not
own
their
wives
or
children
no
not
even
their
own
bodies
much
less
property
but
again
the
servitude
which
the
apostle
was
accustomed
to
must
have
been
very
different
from
american
slavery
for
he
says
the
heir
or
son
as
long
as
he
is
a
child
differeth
from
a
though
he
be
lord
of
all
but
is
under
and
governors
until
the
time
appointed
of
the
father
from
this
it
appears
that
the
means
of
were
provided
for
as
well
as
children
and
indeed
we
know
it
must
have
been
so
among
the
jews
because
their
servants
were
not
permitted
to
remain
in
perpetual
bondage
and
therefore
it
was
absolutely
necessary
they
should
be
prepared
to
occupy
higher
stations
in
society
than
those
of
servants
is
it
so
at
the
south
my
friends
is
the
daily
bread
of
instruction
provided
for
are
their
minds
enlightened
and
they
gradually
prepared
to
rise
from
the
grade
of
menials
into
that
of
independent
members
of
the
state
let
your
own
statute
book
and
your
own
daily
experience
answer
these
questions
if
this
apostle
sanctioned
why
did
he
exhort
masters
thus
in
his
epistle
to
the
ephesians
and
ye
masters
do
the
same
things
unto
them
perform
your
duties
to
your
servants
as
unto
christ
not
unto
me
knowing
that
your
master
also
is
in
heaven
neither
is
respect
of
persons
with
and
in
colossians
masters
give
unto
your
servants
that
which
is
and
knowing
that
ye
also
have
a
master
in
heaven
let
slaveholders
only
these
injunctions
of
paul
and
i
am
satisfied
slavery
would
soon
be
abolished
if
he
thought
it
sinful
even
to
servants
surely
he
must
have
thought
it
sinful
to
flog
and
to
beat
them
with
sticks
and
paddles
indeed
when
delineating
the
character
of
a
bishop
he
expressly
names
this
as
one
feature
of
it
let
masters
give
unto
their
servants
that
which
is
and
and
all
that
vast
system
of
unrequited
labor
would
crumble
into
ruin
yes
and
if
they
once
felt
they
had
no
right
to
the
of
their
servants
without
pay
surely
they
could
not
think
they
had
a
right
to
their
wives
their
children
and
their
own
bodies
again
how
can
it
be
said
paul
sanctioned
slavery
when
as
though
to
put
this
matter
beyond
all
doubt
in
that
black
catalogue
of
sins
enumerated
in
his
first
epistle
to
timothy
he
mentions
which
word
may
be
translated
but
you
may
say
we
all
despise
slavedealers
as
much
as
any
one
can
they
are
never
admitted
into
genteel
or
respectable
society
and
why
not
is
it
not
because
even
you
shrink
back
from
the
idea
of
associating
with
those
who
make
their
fortunes
by
trading
in
the
bodies
and
souls
of
men
women
and
children
whose
daily
work
it
is
to
break
human
hearts
by
tearing
wives
from
their
husbands
and
children
from
their
parents
but
why
hold
slavedealers
as
despicable
if
their
trade
is
lawful
and
virtuous
and
why
despise
them
more
than
the
of
fortune
and
who
employ
them
as
agents
why
more
than
the
of
who
barter
their
to
them
for
gold
and
silver
we
do
not
despise
the
land
agent
or
the
physician
or
the
merchant
and
why
simply
because
their
professions
are
virtuous
and
honorable
and
if
the
trade
of
was
honorable
you
would
not
despise
them
either
there
is
no
difference
in
in
between
the
despised
slavedealer
and
the
who
buys
slaves
from
or
sells
slaves
to
him
indeed
if
slaves
were
not
wanted
by
the
respectable
the
wealthy
and
the
religious
in
a
community
there
would
be
no
slaves
in
that
community
and
of
course
no
it
is
then
the
and
the
and
of
the
south
who
are
the
of
this
grand
temple
built
to
mammon
and
to
moloch
it
is
the
in
every
country
who
are
to
blame
when
any
public
sin
is
supported
by
public
opinion
hence
isaiah
says
the
lord
hath
performed
his
whole
work
upon
mount
and
on
then
i
will
punish
the
fruit
of
the
stout
heart
of
the
king
of
assyria
and
the
glory
of
his
high
looks
and
was
it
not
so
open
the
historical
records
of
that
age
was
not
israel
carried
into
captivity
judah
and
the
stout
heart
of
the
heathen
monarchy
not
punished
until
years
judah
and
seventy
years
israel
captivity
when
it
was
overthrown
by
cyrus
king
of
persia
hence
too
the
apostle
peter
says
judgment
must
at
the
house
of
surely
this
would
not
be
the
case
if
the
of
were
not
of
blame
but
it
may
be
asked
why
are
most
culpable
i
will
tell
you
my
friends
it
is
because
sin
is
imputed
to
us
just
in
proportion
to
the
spiritual
light
we
receive
thus
the
prophet
amos
says
in
the
name
of
jehovah
have
i
known
of
all
the
families
of
the
earth
i
will
punish
you
for
all
your
iniquities
hear
too
the
doctrine
of
our
lord
on
this
important
subject
the
servant
who
his
lord
will
and
himself
neither
did
according
to
his
will
shall
be
beaten
with
stripes
and
why
for
unto
whomsoever
is
given
shall
be
required
and
to
whom
men
have
committed
of
they
will
ask
the
oh
then
that
the
of
the
south
would
ponder
these
things
in
their
hearts
and
awake
to
the
vast
responsibilities
which
rest
at
this
important
crisis
i
have
thus
i
think
clearly
proved
to
you
seven
propositions
viz
first
that
slavery
is
contrary
to
the
declaration
of
our
independence
second
that
it
is
contrary
to
the
first
charter
of
human
rights
given
to
adam
and
renewed
to
noah
third
that
the
fact
of
slavery
having
been
the
subject
of
prophecy
furnishes
excuse
whatever
to
slavedealers
fourth
that
no
such
system
existed
under
the
patriarchal
dispensation
fifth
that
existed
under
the
jewish
dispensation
but
so
far
otherwise
that
every
servant
was
placed
under
the
of
and
care
taken
not
only
to
prevent
all
servitude
but
all
bondage
sixth
that
slavery
in
america
reduces
a
to
a
a
chattel
personal
of
his
rights
as
a
fetters
both
his
mind
and
body
and
protects
the
in
the
most
unnatural
and
unreasonable
power
whilst
it
him
of
the
protection
of
law
seventh
that
slavery
is
contrary
to
the
example
and
precepts
of
our
holy
and
merciful
redeemer
and
of
his
apostles
but
perhaps
you
will
be
ready
to
query
why
appeal
to
on
this
subject
do
not
make
the
laws
which
perpetuate
slavery
legislative
power
is
vested
in
can
do
nothing
to
overthrow
the
system
even
if
we
wished
to
do
so
to
this
i
reply
i
know
you
do
not
make
the
laws
but
i
also
know
that
are
the
wives
and
mothers
the
sisters
and
daughters
of
those
who
and
if
you
really
suppose
can
do
nothing
to
overthrow
slavery
you
are
greatly
mistaken
you
can
do
much
in
every
way
four
things
i
will
name
you
can
read
on
this
subject
you
can
pray
over
this
subject
you
can
speak
on
this
subject
you
can
on
this
subject
i
have
not
placed
reading
before
praying
because
i
regard
it
more
important
but
because
in
order
to
pray
aright
we
must
understand
what
we
are
praying
for
it
is
only
then
we
can
pray
with
the
understanding
and
the
spirit
also
read
then
on
the
subject
of
slavery
search
the
scriptures
daily
whether
the
things
i
have
told
you
are
true
other
books
and
papers
might
be
a
great
help
to
you
to
this
investigation
but
they
are
not
necessary
and
it
is
hardly
probable
that
your
committees
of
vigilance
will
allow
you
to
have
any
other
the
then
is
the
book
i
want
you
to
read
in
the
spirit
of
inquiry
and
the
spirit
of
prayer
even
the
enemies
of
abolitionists
acknowledge
that
their
doctrines
are
drawn
from
it
in
the
great
mob
in
boston
last
autumn
when
the
books
and
papers
of
the
society
were
thrown
out
of
the
windows
of
their
office
one
individual
laid
hold
of
the
bible
and
was
about
tossing
it
out
to
the
ground
when
another
reminded
him
that
it
was
the
bible
he
had
in
his
hand
o
all
he
replied
and
out
went
the
sacred
volume
along
with
the
rest
we
thank
him
for
the
acknowledgment
yes
is
all
for
our
books
and
papers
are
mostly
commentaries
on
the
bible
and
the
declaration
read
the
it
contains
the
words
of
jesus
and
they
are
spirit
and
life
judge
for
yourselves
whether
such
a
system
of
oppression
and
crime
pray
over
this
subject
when
you
have
entered
into
your
closets
and
shut
to
the
doors
then
pray
to
your
father
who
seeth
in
secret
that
he
would
open
your
eyes
to
see
whether
slavery
is
and
if
it
is
that
he
would
enable
you
to
bear
a
faithful
open
and
testimony
against
it
and
to
do
whatsoever
your
hands
find
to
do
leaving
the
consequences
entirely
to
him
who
still
says
to
us
whenever
we
try
to
reason
away
duty
from
the
fear
of
consequences
is
that
to
thee
follow
thou
pray
also
for
that
poor
slave
that
he
may
be
kept
patient
and
submissive
under
his
hard
lot
until
god
is
pleased
to
open
the
door
of
freedom
to
him
without
violence
or
bloodshed
pray
too
for
the
master
that
his
heart
may
be
softened
and
he
made
willing
to
acknowledge
as
joseph
brethren
did
verily
we
are
guilty
concerning
our
brother
before
he
will
be
compelled
to
add
in
consequence
of
divine
judgment
therefore
is
all
this
evil
come
upon
us
pray
also
for
all
your
brethren
and
sisters
who
are
laboring
in
the
righteous
cause
of
emancipation
in
the
northern
states
england
and
the
world
there
is
great
encouragement
for
prayer
in
these
words
of
our
lord
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
the
father
in
my
name
he
will
give
it
to
you
pray
then
without
ceasing
in
the
closet
and
the
social
circle
speak
on
this
subject
it
is
through
the
tongue
the
pen
and
the
press
that
truth
is
principally
propagated
speak
then
to
your
relatives
your
friends
your
acquaintances
on
the
subject
of
slavery
be
not
afraid
if
you
are
conscientiously
convinced
it
is
to
say
so
openly
but
calmly
and
to
let
your
sentiments
be
known
if
you
are
served
by
the
slaves
of
others
try
to
ameliorate
their
condition
as
much
as
possible
never
aggravate
their
faults
and
thus
add
fuel
to
the
fire
of
anger
already
kindled
in
a
master
and
mistress
bosom
remember
their
extreme
ignorance
and
consider
them
as
your
heavenly
father
does
the
culpable
on
this
account
even
when
they
do
wrong
things
discountenance
cruelty
to
them
all
starvation
all
corporal
chastisement
these
may
brutalize
and
their
spirits
but
will
never
bend
them
to
willing
cheerful
obedience
if
possible
see
that
they
are
comfortably
and
fed
whether
in
the
house
or
the
field
it
is
unreasonable
and
cruel
to
expect
slaves
to
wait
for
their
breakfast
until
eleven
when
they
rise
at
five
or
six
do
all
you
can
to
induce
their
owners
to
clothe
them
well
and
to
allow
them
many
little
indulgences
which
would
contribute
to
their
comfort
above
all
try
to
persuade
your
husband
father
brothers
and
sons
that
is
a
crime
against
god
and
and
that
it
is
a
great
sin
to
keep
in
such
abject
ignorance
to
deny
them
the
privilege
of
learning
to
read
and
write
the
catholics
are
universally
condemned
for
denying
the
bible
to
the
common
people
but
must
blame
them
for
are
doing
the
same
and
for
the
very
same
reason
neither
of
these
systems
can
bear
the
light
which
bursts
from
the
pages
of
that
holy
book
and
lastly
endeavour
to
inculcate
submission
on
the
part
of
the
slaves
but
whilst
doing
this
be
faithful
in
pleading
the
cause
of
the
oppressed
will
behold
unheeding
life
holiest
feelings
crushed
where
heart
is
bleeding
shall
voice
be
hushed
act
on
this
subject
some
of
you
slaves
yourselves
if
you
believe
slavery
is
set
them
at
liberty
undo
the
heavy
burdens
and
let
the
oppressed
go
free
if
they
wish
to
remain
with
you
pay
them
wages
if
not
let
them
leave
you
should
they
remain
teach
them
and
have
them
taught
the
common
branches
of
an
english
education
they
have
minds
and
those
minds
to
be
so
precious
a
talent
as
intellect
never
was
given
to
be
wrapt
in
a
napkin
and
buried
in
the
earth
it
is
the
of
all
as
far
as
they
can
to
improve
their
own
mental
faculties
because
we
are
commanded
to
love
god
with
our
as
well
as
with
all
our
hearts
and
we
commit
a
great
sin
if
we
or
that
cultivation
of
the
mind
in
others
which
would
enable
them
to
perform
this
duty
teach
your
servants
then
to
read
and
encourage
them
to
believe
it
is
their
to
learn
if
it
were
only
that
they
might
read
the
bible
but
some
of
you
will
say
we
can
neither
free
our
slaves
nor
teach
them
to
read
for
the
laws
of
our
state
forbid
it
be
not
surprised
when
i
say
such
wicked
laws
to
be
no
in
the
way
of
your
duty
and
i
appeal
to
the
bible
to
prove
this
position
what
was
the
conduct
of
shiphrah
and
puah
when
the
king
of
egypt
issued
his
cruel
mandate
with
regard
to
the
hebrew
children
feared
and
did
as
the
king
of
egypt
commanded
them
but
saved
the
men
children
alive
did
these
do
right
in
disobeying
that
monarch
says
the
sacred
text
dealt
with
them
and
made
them
houses
ex
i
what
was
the
conduct
of
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
when
nebuchadnezzar
set
up
a
golden
image
in
the
plain
of
dura
and
commanded
all
people
nations
and
languages
to
fall
down
and
worship
it
be
it
known
unto
thee
said
these
faithful
o
king
that
will
serve
thy
gods
nor
worship
the
image
which
thou
hast
set
up
did
these
men
right
in
disobeying
the
of
their
sovereign
let
their
miraculous
deliverance
from
the
burning
fiery
furnace
answer
dan
iii
what
was
the
conduct
of
daniel
when
darius
made
a
firm
decree
that
no
one
should
ask
a
petition
of
any
man
or
god
for
thirty
days
did
the
prophet
cease
to
pray
no
when
daniel
that
the
writing
was
he
went
into
his
house
and
his
windows
being
towards
jerusalem
he
kneeled
upon
his
knees
three
times
a
day
and
prayed
and
gave
thanks
before
his
god
as
he
did
aforetime
did
daniel
do
right
thus
to
the
law
of
his
king
let
his
wonderful
deliverance
out
of
the
mouths
of
the
lions
answer
dan
vii
look
too
at
the
apostles
peter
and
john
when
the
rulers
of
the
jews
them
to
speak
at
all
nor
teach
in
the
name
of
jesus
what
did
they
say
whether
it
be
right
in
the
sight
of
god
to
hearken
unto
you
more
than
unto
god
judge
ye
and
what
did
they
do
they
spake
the
word
of
god
with
boldness
and
with
great
power
gave
the
apostles
witness
of
the
of
the
lord
jesus
although
was
the
very
doctrine
for
the
preaching
of
which
they
had
just
been
cast
into
prison
and
further
threatened
did
these
men
do
right
i
leave
to
answer
who
now
enjoy
the
benefits
of
their
labors
and
sufferings
in
that
gospel
they
dared
to
preach
when
positively
commanded
to
teach
any
in
the
name
of
jesus
acts
iv
but
some
of
you
may
say
if
we
do
free
our
slaves
they
will
be
taken
up
and
sold
therefore
there
will
be
no
use
in
doing
it
peter
and
john
might
just
as
well
have
said
we
will
not
preach
the
gospel
for
if
we
do
we
shall
be
taken
up
and
put
in
prison
therefore
there
will
be
no
use
in
our
preaching
my
friends
belong
no
more
to
than
they
did
to
these
apostles
duty
is
ours
and
events
are
god
if
you
think
slavery
is
sinful
all
have
to
do
is
to
set
your
slaves
at
liberty
do
all
you
can
to
protect
them
and
in
humble
faith
and
fervent
prayer
commend
them
to
your
common
father
he
can
take
care
of
them
but
if
for
wise
purposes
he
sees
fit
to
allow
them
to
be
sold
this
will
afford
you
an
opportunity
of
testifying
openly
wherever
you
go
against
the
crime
of
such
an
act
will
be
and
if
exposed
might
under
the
divine
direction
do
the
cause
of
emancipation
more
good
than
any
thing
that
could
happen
for
he
makes
even
the
wrath
of
man
to
praise
him
and
the
remainder
of
wrath
he
will
restrain
i
know
that
this
doctrine
of
obeying
rather
than
man
will
be
considered
as
dangerous
and
heretical
by
many
but
i
am
not
afraid
openly
to
avow
it
because
it
is
the
doctrine
of
the
bible
but
i
would
not
be
understood
to
advocate
resistance
to
any
law
however
oppressive
if
in
obeying
it
i
was
not
obliged
to
commit
if
for
instance
there
was
a
law
which
imposed
imprisonment
or
a
fine
upon
me
if
i
manumitted
a
slave
i
would
on
no
account
resist
that
law
i
would
set
the
slave
free
and
then
go
to
prison
or
pay
the
fine
if
a
law
commands
me
to
i
will
break
if
it
calls
me
to
i
will
let
it
take
its
course
the
doctrine
of
blind
obedience
and
unqualified
submission
to
power
whether
civil
or
ecclesiastical
is
the
doctrine
of
despotism
and
ought
to
have
no
place
among
republicans
and
christians
but
you
will
perhaps
say
such
a
course
of
conduct
would
inevitably
expose
us
to
great
suffering
yes
my
christian
friends
i
believe
it
would
but
this
will
excuse
you
or
any
one
else
for
the
neglect
of
if
prophets
and
apostles
martyrs
and
reformers
had
not
been
willing
to
suffer
for
the
truth
sake
where
would
the
world
have
been
now
if
they
had
said
we
can
not
speak
the
truth
we
can
not
do
what
we
believe
is
right
because
the
of
our
country
or
public
opinion
are
against
where
would
our
holy
religion
have
been
now
the
prophets
were
stoned
imprisoned
and
killed
by
the
jews
and
why
because
they
exposed
and
openly
rebuked
public
sins
they
opposed
public
opinion
had
they
held
their
peace
they
all
might
have
lived
in
ease
and
died
in
favor
with
a
wicked
generation
why
were
the
apostles
persecuted
from
city
to
city
stoned
incarcerated
beaten
and
crucified
because
they
dared
to
the
to
tell
the
jews
boldly
and
fearlessly
that
were
the
of
the
lord
of
glory
and
that
however
great
a
the
cross
might
be
to
them
there
was
no
other
name
given
under
heaven
by
which
men
could
be
saved
but
the
name
of
jesus
because
they
declared
even
at
athens
the
seat
of
learning
and
refinement
the
truth
that
they
be
no
gods
that
are
made
with
men
hands
and
exposed
to
the
grecians
the
foolishness
of
worldly
wisdom
and
the
impossibility
of
salvation
but
through
christ
whom
they
despised
on
account
of
the
ignominious
death
he
died
because
at
rome
the
proud
mistress
of
the
world
they
thundered
out
the
terrors
of
the
law
upon
that
idolatrous
and
community
why
were
the
martyrs
stretched
upon
the
rack
gibbetted
and
burnt
the
scorn
and
diversion
of
a
nero
whilst
their
tarred
and
burning
bodies
sent
up
a
light
which
illuminated
the
roman
capital
why
were
the
waldenses
hunted
like
wild
beasts
upon
the
mountains
of
piedmont
and
slain
with
the
sword
of
the
duke
of
savoy
and
the
proud
monarch
of
france
why
were
the
presbyterians
chased
like
the
partridge
over
the
highlands
of
scotland
the
methodists
pumped
and
stoned
and
pelted
with
rotten
eggs
the
quakers
incarcerated
in
filthy
prisons
beaten
whipped
at
the
cart
tail
banished
and
hung
because
they
dared
to
the
to
the
unrighteous
of
their
country
and
chose
rather
to
suffer
affliction
with
the
people
of
god
not
accepting
deliverance
even
under
the
gallows
why
were
luther
and
calvin
persecuted
and
excommunicated
cranmer
ridley
and
latimer
burnt
because
they
fearlessly
proclaimed
the
truth
though
that
truth
was
contrary
to
public
opinion
and
the
authority
of
ecclesiastical
councils
and
conventions
now
all
this
vast
amount
of
human
suffering
might
have
been
saved
all
these
prophets
and
apostles
martyrs
and
reformers
might
have
lived
and
died
in
peace
with
all
men
but
following
the
example
of
their
great
pattern
they
despised
the
shame
endured
the
cross
and
are
now
set
down
on
the
right
hand
of
the
throne
of
god
having
received
the
glorious
welcome
of
well
good
and
faithful
servants
enter
ye
into
the
joy
of
your
lord
but
you
may
say
we
are
how
can
hearts
endure
persecution
and
why
not
have
not
stood
up
in
all
the
dignity
and
strength
of
moral
courage
to
be
the
leaders
of
the
people
and
to
bear
a
faithful
testimony
for
the
truth
whenever
the
providence
of
god
has
called
them
to
do
so
are
there
no
in
that
noble
army
of
martyrs
who
are
now
singing
the
song
of
moses
and
the
lamb
who
led
out
the
women
of
israel
from
the
house
of
bondage
striking
the
timbrel
and
singing
the
song
of
deliverance
on
the
banks
of
that
sea
whose
waters
stood
up
like
walls
of
crystal
to
open
a
passage
for
their
escape
it
was
a
miriam
the
prophetess
the
sister
of
moses
and
aaron
who
went
up
with
barak
to
kadesh
to
fight
against
jabin
king
of
canaan
into
whose
hand
israel
had
been
sold
because
of
their
iniquities
it
was
a
deborah
the
wife
of
lapidoth
the
judge
as
well
as
the
prophetess
of
that
backsliding
people
judges
iv
into
whose
hands
was
sisera
the
captain
of
jabin
host
delivered
into
the
hand
of
a
jael
the
wife
of
heber
judges
vi
who
dared
to
the
concerning
those
judgments
which
were
coming
upon
judea
when
josiah
alarmed
at
finding
that
his
people
had
not
kept
the
word
of
the
lord
to
do
after
all
that
was
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
sent
to
enquire
of
the
lord
concerning
these
things
it
was
a
huldah
the
prophetess
the
wife
of
shallum
chron
xxxiv
who
was
chosen
to
deliver
the
whole
jewish
nation
from
that
murderous
decree
of
persia
king
which
wicked
haman
had
obtained
by
calumny
and
fraud
it
was
a
esther
the
queen
yes
weak
and
trembling
was
the
instrument
appointed
by
god
to
reverse
the
bloody
mandate
of
the
eastern
monarch
and
save
the
visible
from
destruction
what
human
voice
first
proclaimed
to
mary
that
she
should
be
the
mother
of
our
lord
it
was
a
elizabeth
the
wife
of
zacharias
luke
i
who
united
with
the
good
old
simeon
in
giving
thanks
publicly
in
the
temple
when
the
child
jesus
was
presented
there
by
his
parents
and
spake
of
him
to
all
them
that
looked
for
redemption
in
jerusalem
it
was
a
anna
the
prophetess
who
first
proclaimed
christ
as
the
true
messiah
in
the
streets
of
samaria
once
the
capital
of
the
ten
tribes
it
was
a
who
ministered
to
the
son
of
god
whilst
on
earth
a
despised
and
persecuted
reformer
in
the
humble
garb
of
a
carpenter
they
were
who
followed
the
rejected
king
of
israel
as
his
fainting
footsteps
trod
the
road
to
calvary
a
great
company
of
people
and
of
and
it
is
remarkable
that
to
he
turned
and
addressed
the
pathetic
language
daughters
of
jerusalem
weep
not
for
me
but
weep
for
yourselves
and
your
children
ah
who
sent
unto
the
roman
governor
when
he
was
set
down
on
the
judgment
seat
saying
unto
him
have
thou
nothing
to
do
with
that
just
man
for
i
have
suffered
many
things
this
day
in
a
dream
because
of
him
it
was
a
the
wife
of
pilate
although
that
for
envy
the
jews
had
delivered
christ
yet
consented
to
surrender
the
son
of
god
into
the
hands
of
a
brutal
soldiery
after
having
himself
scourged
his
naked
body
had
the
of
pilate
sat
upon
that
judgment
seat
what
would
have
been
the
result
of
the
trial
of
this
just
person
and
who
last
hung
round
the
cross
of
jesus
on
the
mountain
of
golgotha
who
first
visited
the
sepulchre
early
in
the
morning
on
the
first
day
of
the
week
carrying
sweet
spices
to
embalm
his
precious
body
not
knowing
that
it
was
incorruptible
and
could
not
be
holden
by
the
bands
of
death
these
were
to
whom
did
he
appear
after
his
resurrection
it
was
to
a
mary
magdalene
mark
xvi
who
gathered
with
the
apostles
to
wait
at
jerusalem
in
prayer
and
supplication
for
the
promise
of
the
father
the
spiritual
blessing
of
the
great
high
priest
of
his
church
who
had
entered
into
the
splendid
temple
of
solomon
there
to
offer
the
blood
of
bulls
and
of
goats
and
the
smoking
censer
upon
the
golden
altar
but
into
heaven
itself
there
to
present
his
intercessions
after
having
given
himself
for
us
an
offering
and
a
sacrifice
to
god
for
a
sweet
smelling
savor
were
among
that
holy
company
acts
i
and
did
wait
in
vain
did
those
who
had
ministered
to
his
necessities
followed
in
his
train
and
wept
at
his
crucifixion
wait
in
vain
no
no
did
the
cloven
tongues
of
fire
descend
upon
the
heads
of
as
well
as
men
yes
my
friends
it
sat
upon
one
of
acts
ii
as
well
as
men
were
to
be
living
stones
in
the
temple
of
grace
and
therefore
heads
were
consecrated
by
the
descent
of
the
holy
ghost
as
well
as
those
of
men
were
recognized
as
fellow
laborers
in
the
gospel
field
they
were
paul
says
in
his
epistle
to
the
philippians
help
those
who
labored
with
me
in
the
gospel
phil
iv
but
this
is
not
all
roman
were
burnt
at
the
stake
delicate
limbs
were
torn
joint
from
joint
by
the
ferocious
beasts
of
the
amphitheatre
and
tossed
by
the
wild
bull
in
his
fury
for
the
diversion
of
that
idolatrous
warlike
and
slaveholding
people
yes
suffered
under
the
ten
persecutions
of
heathen
rome
with
the
most
unshrinking
constancy
and
fortitude
not
all
the
entreaties
of
friends
nor
the
claims
of
new
born
infancy
nor
the
cruel
threats
of
enemies
could
make
sprinkle
one
grain
of
incense
upon
the
altars
of
roman
idols
come
now
with
me
to
the
beautiful
valleys
of
piedmont
whose
blood
stains
the
green
sward
and
decks
the
wild
flowers
with
colors
not
their
own
and
smokes
on
the
sword
of
persecuting
france
it
is
as
well
as
man
yes
were
accounted
as
sheep
for
the
slaughter
and
were
cut
down
as
the
tender
saplings
of
the
wood
but
time
would
fail
me
to
tell
of
all
those
hundreds
and
thousands
of
who
perished
in
the
low
countries
of
holland
when
alva
sword
of
vengeance
was
unsheathed
against
the
protestants
when
the
catholic
inquisitions
of
europe
became
the
merciless
executioners
of
vindictive
wrath
upon
those
who
dared
to
worship
god
instead
of
bowing
down
in
unholy
adoration
before
my
lord
god
the
and
when
england
too
burnt
her
ann
ascoes
at
the
stake
of
martyrdom
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
church
after
having
been
driven
from
judea
to
rome
and
from
rome
to
piedmont
and
from
piedmont
to
england
and
from
england
to
holland
at
last
stretched
her
fainting
wings
over
the
dark
bosom
of
the
atlantic
and
found
on
the
shores
of
a
great
wilderness
a
refuge
from
tyranny
and
oppression
as
she
thought
but
the
warm
blush
of
shame
mantles
my
cheek
as
i
write
it
here
was
beaten
and
banished
imprisoned
and
hung
upon
the
gallows
a
trophy
to
the
cross
and
what
i
would
ask
in
conclusion
have
done
for
the
great
and
glorious
cause
of
emancipation
who
wrote
that
pamphlet
which
moved
the
heart
of
wilberforce
to
pray
over
the
wrongs
and
his
tongue
to
plead
the
cause
of
the
oppressed
african
it
was
a
elizabeth
heyrick
who
labored
assiduously
to
keep
the
sufferings
of
the
slave
continually
before
the
british
public
they
were
and
how
did
they
do
it
by
their
needles
paint
brushes
and
pens
by
speaking
the
truth
and
petitioning
parliament
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
and
what
was
the
effect
of
their
labors
read
it
in
the
emancipation
bill
of
great
britain
read
it
in
the
present
state
of
her
west
india
colonies
read
it
in
the
impulse
which
has
been
given
to
the
cause
of
freedom
in
the
united
states
of
america
have
english
women
then
done
so
much
for
the
negro
and
shall
american
women
do
nothing
oh
no
already
are
there
sixty
female
societies
in
operation
these
are
doing
just
what
the
english
women
did
telling
the
story
of
the
colored
wrongs
praying
for
his
deliverance
and
presenting
his
kneeling
image
constantly
before
the
public
eye
on
bags
and
even
the
children
of
the
north
are
inscribing
on
their
handy
work
may
the
points
of
our
needles
prick
the
slaveholder
conscience
some
of
the
reports
of
these
societies
exhibit
not
only
considerable
talent
but
a
deep
sense
of
religious
duty
and
a
determination
to
persevere
through
evil
as
well
as
good
report
until
every
scourge
and
every
shackle
is
buried
under
the
feet
of
the
manumitted
slave
the
ladies
society
of
boston
was
called
last
fall
to
a
severe
trial
of
their
faith
and
constancy
they
were
mobbed
by
the
gentlemen
of
property
and
standing
in
that
city
at
their
anniversary
meeting
and
their
lives
were
jeoparded
by
an
infuriated
crowd
but
their
conduct
on
that
occasion
did
credit
to
our
sex
and
affords
a
full
assurance
that
they
will
abandon
the
cause
of
the
slave
the
pamphlet
right
and
wrong
in
boston
issued
by
them
in
which
a
particular
account
is
given
of
that
mob
of
broad
cloth
in
broad
day
does
equal
credit
to
the
head
and
the
heart
of
her
who
wrote
it
i
wish
my
southern
sisters
could
read
it
they
would
then
understand
that
the
women
of
the
north
have
engaged
in
this
work
from
a
sense
of
and
that
nothing
will
ever
induce
them
to
take
their
hands
from
it
until
it
is
fully
accomplished
they
feel
no
hostility
to
you
no
bitterness
or
wrath
they
rather
sympathize
in
your
trials
and
difficulties
but
they
well
know
that
the
first
thing
to
be
done
to
help
you
is
to
pour
in
the
light
of
truth
on
your
minds
to
urge
you
to
reflect
on
and
pray
over
the
subject
this
is
all
can
do
for
you
must
work
out
your
own
deliverance
with
fear
and
trembling
and
with
the
direction
and
blessing
of
god
can
do
northern
women
may
labor
to
produce
a
correct
public
opinion
at
the
north
but
if
southern
women
sit
down
in
listless
indifference
and
criminal
idleness
public
opinion
can
not
be
rectified
and
purified
at
the
south
it
is
manifest
to
every
reflecting
mind
that
slavery
must
be
abolished
the
era
in
which
we
live
and
the
light
which
is
overspreading
the
whole
world
on
this
subject
clearly
show
that
the
time
can
not
be
distant
when
it
will
be
done
now
there
are
only
two
ways
in
which
it
can
be
effected
by
moral
power
or
physical
force
and
it
is
for
to
choose
which
of
these
you
prefer
slavery
always
has
and
always
will
produce
insurrections
wherever
it
exists
because
it
is
a
violation
of
the
natural
order
of
things
and
no
human
power
can
much
longer
perpetuate
it
the
opposers
of
abolitionists
fully
believe
this
one
of
them
remarked
to
me
not
long
since
there
is
no
doubt
there
will
be
a
most
terrible
overturning
at
the
south
in
a
few
years
such
cruelty
and
wrong
must
be
visited
with
divine
vengeance
soon
abolitionists
believe
too
that
this
must
inevitably
be
the
case
if
you
do
not
repent
and
they
are
not
willing
to
leave
you
to
perish
without
entreating
you
to
save
yourselves
from
destruction
well
may
they
say
with
the
apostle
am
i
then
your
enemy
because
i
tell
you
the
truth
and
warn
you
to
flee
from
impending
judgments
but
why
my
dear
friends
have
i
thus
been
endeavoring
to
lead
you
through
the
history
of
more
than
three
thousand
years
and
to
point
you
to
that
great
cloud
of
witnesses
who
have
gone
before
from
works
to
rewards
have
i
been
seeking
to
magnify
the
sufferings
and
exalt
the
character
of
woman
that
she
might
have
praise
of
men
no
no
my
object
has
been
to
arouse
as
the
wives
and
mothers
the
daughters
and
sisters
of
the
south
to
a
sense
of
your
duty
as
and
as
christian
women
on
that
great
subject
which
has
already
shaken
our
country
from
the
lawrence
and
the
lakes
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
from
the
mississippi
to
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
will
continue
mightily
to
shake
until
the
polluted
temple
of
slavery
fall
and
crumble
into
ruin
i
would
say
unto
each
one
of
you
what
meanest
thou
o
sleeper
arise
and
call
upon
thy
god
if
so
be
that
god
will
think
upon
us
that
we
perish
not
perceive
you
not
that
dark
cloud
of
vengeance
which
hangs
over
our
boasting
republic
saw
you
not
the
lightnings
of
heaven
wrath
in
the
flame
which
leaped
from
the
indian
torch
to
the
roof
of
yonder
dwelling
and
lighted
with
its
horrid
glare
the
darkness
of
midnight
heard
you
not
the
thunders
of
divine
anger
as
the
distant
roar
of
the
cannon
came
rolling
onward
from
the
texian
country
where
protestant
american
rebels
are
fighting
with
mexican
republicans
for
what
for
the
of
yes
of
american
slavery
in
the
bosom
of
a
catholic
republic
where
that
system
of
robbery
violence
and
wrong
had
been
legally
abolished
for
twelve
years
yes
citizens
of
the
united
states
after
plundering
mexico
of
her
land
are
now
engaged
in
deadly
conflict
for
the
privilege
of
fastening
chains
and
collars
and
manacles
upon
whom
upon
the
subjects
of
some
foreign
prince
no
upon
native
born
american
republican
citizens
although
the
fathers
of
these
very
men
declared
to
the
whole
world
while
struggling
to
free
themselves
from
the
three
penny
taxes
of
an
english
king
that
they
believed
it
to
be
a
truth
that
were
created
equal
and
had
an
right
to
well
may
the
poet
exclaim
in
bitter
sarcasm
the
fustian
flag
that
proudly
waves
in
solemn
mockery
a
land
of
can
you
not
my
friends
understand
the
signs
of
the
times
do
you
not
see
the
sword
of
retributive
justice
hanging
over
the
south
or
are
you
still
slumbering
at
your
posts
are
there
no
shiphrahs
no
puahs
among
you
who
will
dare
in
christian
firmness
and
christian
meekness
to
refuse
to
obey
the
which
require
to
enslave
to
degrade
and
to
brutalize
woman
are
there
no
miriams
who
would
rejoice
to
lead
out
the
captive
daughters
of
the
southern
states
to
liberty
and
light
are
there
no
huldahs
there
who
will
dare
to
the
concerning
the
sins
of
the
people
and
those
judgments
which
it
requires
no
prophet
eye
to
see
must
follow
if
repentance
is
not
speedily
sought
is
there
no
esther
among
you
who
will
plead
for
the
poor
devoted
slave
read
the
history
of
this
persian
queen
it
is
full
of
instruction
she
at
first
refused
to
plead
for
the
jews
but
hear
the
words
of
mordecai
think
not
within
thyself
that
shalt
escape
in
the
king
house
more
than
all
the
jews
for
thou
altogether
holdest
thy
peace
at
this
then
shall
there
enlargement
and
deliverance
arise
to
the
jews
from
another
place
but
and
thy
father
house
shall
be
listen
too
to
her
magnanimous
reply
to
this
powerful
appeal
will
in
unto
the
king
which
is
not
according
to
law
and
if
i
perish
i
perish
yes
if
there
were
but
esther
at
the
south
she
save
her
country
from
ruin
but
let
the
christian
women
there
arise
as
the
christian
women
of
great
britain
did
in
the
majesty
of
moral
power
and
that
salvation
is
certain
let
them
embody
themselves
in
societies
and
send
petitions
up
to
their
different
legislatures
entreating
their
husbands
fathers
brothers
and
sons
to
abolish
the
institution
of
slavery
no
longer
to
subject
to
the
scourge
and
the
chain
to
mental
darkness
and
moral
degradation
no
longer
to
tear
husbands
from
their
wives
and
children
from
their
parents
no
longer
to
make
men
women
and
children
work
wages
no
longer
to
make
their
lives
bitter
in
hard
bondage
no
longer
to
reduce
to
the
abject
condition
of
of
chattels
personal
no
longer
to
barter
the
of
in
human
shambles
for
corruptible
things
such
as
silver
and
gold
the
of
the
south
can
this
horrible
system
of
oppression
and
cruelty
licentiousness
and
wrong
such
appeals
to
your
legislatures
would
be
irresistible
for
there
is
something
in
the
heart
of
man
which
bend
under
moral
there
is
a
swift
witness
for
truth
in
his
bosom
which
respond
to
when
it
is
uttered
with
calmness
and
dignity
if
you
could
obtain
but
six
signatures
to
such
a
petition
in
only
one
state
i
would
say
send
up
that
petition
and
be
not
in
the
least
discouraged
by
the
scoffs
and
jeers
of
the
heartless
or
the
resolution
of
the
house
to
lay
it
on
the
table
it
will
be
a
great
thing
if
the
subject
can
be
introduced
into
your
legislatures
in
any
way
even
by
and
will
be
the
most
likely
to
introduce
it
there
in
the
best
possible
manner
as
a
matter
of
and
not
of
expediency
or
politics
you
may
petition
too
the
different
ecclesiastical
bodies
of
the
slave
states
slavery
must
be
attacked
with
the
whole
power
of
truth
and
the
sword
of
the
spirit
you
must
take
it
up
on
ground
and
fight
against
it
with
christian
weapons
whilst
your
feet
are
shod
with
the
preparation
of
the
gospel
of
peace
and
are
loudly
called
upon
by
the
cries
of
the
widow
and
the
orphan
to
arise
and
gird
yourselves
for
this
great
moral
conflict
with
the
whole
armour
of
righteousness
upon
the
right
hand
and
on
the
left
there
is
every
encouragement
for
you
to
labor
and
pray
my
friends
because
the
abolition
of
slavery
as
well
as
its
existence
has
been
the
theme
of
prophecy
ethiopia
says
the
psalmist
shall
stretch
forth
her
hands
unto
god
and
is
she
not
now
doing
so
are
not
the
christian
negroes
of
the
south
lifting
their
hands
in
prayer
for
deliverance
just
as
the
israelites
did
when
their
redemption
was
drawing
nigh
are
they
not
sighing
and
crying
by
reason
of
the
hard
bondage
and
think
you
that
he
of
whom
it
was
said
and
god
heard
their
groaning
and
their
cry
came
up
unto
him
by
reason
of
the
hard
bondage
think
you
that
his
ear
is
heavy
that
he
can
not
hear
the
cries
of
his
suffering
children
or
that
he
who
raised
up
a
moses
an
aaron
and
a
miriam
to
bring
them
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
from
the
house
of
bondage
can
not
now
with
a
high
hand
and
a
stretched
out
arm
rid
the
poor
negroes
out
of
the
hands
of
their
masters
surely
you
believe
that
his
arm
is
shortened
that
he
can
not
save
and
would
not
such
a
work
of
mercy
redound
to
his
glory
but
another
string
of
the
harp
of
prophecy
vibrates
to
the
song
of
deliverance
but
they
shall
sit
every
man
under
his
vine
and
under
his
and
shall
make
them
for
the
mouth
of
the
lord
of
hosts
hath
spoken
it
the
never
can
do
this
as
long
as
he
is
a
whilst
he
is
a
chattel
personal
he
can
own
property
but
the
time
to
when
man
is
to
sit
under
vine
and
and
no
domineering
driver
or
irresponsible
master
or
irascible
mistress
shall
make
him
afraid
of
the
chain
or
the
whip
hear
too
the
sweet
tones
of
another
string
many
shall
run
to
and
fro
and
shall
be
increased
slavery
is
an
insurmountable
barrier
to
the
increase
of
knowledge
in
every
community
where
it
exists
then
must
be
abolished
this
prediction
can
be
fulfiled
the
last
chord
i
shall
touch
will
be
this
they
shall
hurt
nor
destroy
in
all
my
holy
mountain
then
must
be
overthrown
the
prophecies
can
be
accomplished
but
how
are
they
to
be
fulfiled
will
the
wheels
of
the
millennial
car
be
rolled
onward
by
miraculous
power
no
god
designs
to
confer
this
holy
privilege
upon
it
is
through
instrumentality
that
the
great
and
glorious
work
of
reforming
the
world
is
to
be
done
and
see
you
not
how
the
mighty
engine
of
is
dragging
in
its
rear
the
bible
and
peace
societies
and
temperance
sabbath
schools
moral
reform
and
missions
or
to
adopt
another
figure
do
not
these
seven
philanthropic
associations
compose
the
beautiful
tints
in
that
bow
of
promise
which
spans
the
arch
of
our
moral
heaven
who
does
not
believe
that
if
these
societies
were
broken
up
their
constitutions
burnt
and
the
vast
machinery
with
which
they
are
laboring
to
regenerate
mankind
was
stopped
that
the
black
clouds
of
vengeance
would
soon
burst
over
our
world
and
every
city
would
witness
the
fate
of
the
devoted
cities
of
the
plain
each
one
of
these
societies
is
walking
abroad
through
the
earth
scattering
the
seeds
of
truth
over
the
wide
field
of
our
world
not
with
the
hundred
hands
of
a
briareus
but
with
a
hundred
thousand
another
encouragement
for
you
to
labor
my
friends
is
that
you
will
have
the
prayers
and
of
english
and
northern
philanthropists
you
will
never
bend
your
knees
in
supplication
at
the
throne
of
grace
for
the
overthrow
of
slavery
without
meeting
there
the
spirits
of
other
christians
who
will
mingle
their
voices
with
yours
as
the
morning
or
evening
sacrifice
ascends
to
god
yes
the
spirit
of
prayer
and
of
supplication
has
been
poured
out
upon
many
many
hearts
there
are
wrestling
jacobs
who
will
not
let
go
of
the
prophetic
promises
of
deliverance
for
the
captive
and
the
opening
of
prison
doors
to
them
that
are
bound
there
are
pauls
who
are
saying
in
reference
to
this
subject
lord
what
wilt
thou
have
me
to
do
there
are
marys
sitting
in
the
house
now
who
are
ready
to
arise
and
go
forth
is
this
work
as
soon
as
the
message
is
brought
the
master
is
come
and
calleth
for
thee
and
there
are
marthas
too
who
have
already
gone
out
to
meet
jesus
as
he
bends
his
footsteps
to
their
brother
grave
and
weeps
over
the
lifeless
body
of
lazarus
bound
hand
and
foot
in
but
over
the
politically
and
intellectually
lifeless
slave
bound
hand
and
foot
in
the
iron
chains
of
oppression
and
ignorance
some
may
be
ready
to
say
as
martha
did
who
seemed
to
expect
nothing
but
sympathy
from
jesus
lord
by
this
time
he
stinketh
for
he
hath
been
dead
four
days
she
thought
it
useless
to
remove
the
stone
and
expose
the
loathsome
body
of
her
brother
she
could
not
believe
that
so
great
a
miracle
could
be
wrought
as
to
raise
putrefied
into
life
but
jesus
said
take
away
the
stone
and
when
had
taken
away
the
stone
where
the
dead
was
laid
and
uncovered
the
body
of
lazarus
then
it
was
that
jesus
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
said
father
i
thank
thee
that
thou
hast
heard
me
and
when
he
had
thus
spoken
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice
lazarus
come
forth
yes
some
may
be
ready
to
say
of
the
colored
race
how
can
ever
be
raised
politically
and
intellectually
they
have
been
dead
four
hundred
years
but
have
to
do
with
this
is
to
be
done
is
to
take
away
the
stone
which
has
covered
up
the
dead
body
of
our
brother
to
expose
the
putrid
carcass
to
show
that
body
has
been
bound
with
the
of
heathen
ignorance
and
his
face
with
the
napkin
of
prejudice
and
having
done
all
it
was
our
duty
to
do
to
stand
by
the
negro
grave
in
humble
faith
and
holy
hope
waiting
to
hear
the
command
of
lazarus
come
forth
this
is
just
what
societies
are
doing
they
are
taking
away
the
stone
from
the
mouth
of
the
tomb
of
slavery
where
lies
the
putrid
carcass
of
our
brother
they
want
the
pure
light
of
heaven
to
shine
into
that
dark
and
gloomy
cave
they
want
all
men
to
see
that
dead
body
has
been
bound
that
face
has
been
wrapped
in
the
of
and
shall
they
wait
beside
that
grave
in
vain
is
not
jesus
still
the
resurrection
and
the
life
did
he
come
to
proclaim
liberty
to
the
captive
and
the
opening
of
prison
doors
to
them
that
are
bound
in
vain
did
he
promise
to
give
beauty
for
ashes
the
oil
of
joy
for
mourning
and
the
garment
of
praise
for
the
spirit
of
heaviness
unto
them
that
mourn
in
zion
and
will
he
refuse
to
beautify
the
mind
anoint
the
head
and
throw
around
the
captive
negro
the
mantle
of
praise
for
that
spirit
of
heaviness
which
has
so
long
bound
him
down
to
the
ground
or
shall
we
not
rather
say
with
the
prophet
the
zeal
of
the
lord
of
hosts
perform
this
yes
his
promises
are
sure
and
amen
in
christ
jesus
that
he
will
assemble
her
that
halteth
and
gather
her
that
is
driven
out
and
her
that
is
afflicted
but
i
will
now
say
a
few
words
on
the
subject
of
abolitionism
doubtless
you
have
all
heard
societies
denounced
as
insurrectionary
and
mischievous
fanatical
and
dangerous
it
has
been
said
they
publish
the
most
abominable
untruths
and
that
they
are
endeavoring
to
excite
rebellions
at
the
south
have
you
believed
these
reports
my
friends
have
also
been
deceived
by
these
false
assertions
listen
to
me
then
whilst
i
endeavor
to
wipe
from
the
fair
character
of
abolitionism
such
unfounded
accusations
you
know
that
am
a
southerner
you
know
that
my
dearest
relatives
are
now
in
a
slave
state
can
you
for
a
moment
believe
i
would
prove
so
recreant
to
the
feelings
of
a
daughter
and
a
sister
as
to
join
a
society
which
was
seeking
to
overthrow
slavery
by
falsehood
bloodshed
and
murder
i
appeal
to
you
who
have
known
and
loved
me
in
days
that
are
passed
can
believe
it
no
my
friends
as
a
carolinian
i
was
peculiarly
jealous
of
any
movements
on
this
subject
and
before
i
would
join
an
society
i
took
the
precaution
of
becoming
acquainted
with
some
of
the
leading
abolitionists
of
reading
their
publications
and
attending
their
meetings
at
which
i
heard
addresses
both
from
colored
and
white
men
and
it
was
not
until
i
was
fully
convinced
that
their
principles
were
and
their
efforts
that
i
gave
my
name
as
a
member
to
the
female
society
of
philadelphia
since
that
time
i
have
regularly
taken
the
liberator
and
read
many
pamphlets
and
papers
and
books
and
can
assure
you
i
have
seen
a
single
insurrectionary
paragraph
and
never
read
any
account
of
cruelty
which
i
could
not
believe
southerners
may
deny
the
truth
of
these
accounts
but
why
do
they
not
them
to
be
false
their
violent
expressions
of
horror
at
such
accounts
being
believed
deceive
some
but
they
can
not
deceive
for
i
lived
too
long
in
the
midst
of
slavery
not
to
know
what
slavery
is
when
speak
of
this
system
i
speak
that
i
do
know
and
i
am
not
at
all
afraid
to
assert
that
publications
have
overdrawn
the
monstrous
features
of
slavery
at
all
and
many
a
southerner
this
as
well
as
i
do
a
lady
in
north
carolina
remarked
to
a
friend
of
mine
about
eighteen
months
since
northerners
know
nothing
at
all
about
slavery
they
think
it
is
perpetual
bondage
only
but
of
the
of
that
word
involves
they
have
no
conception
if
they
had
would
never
their
efforts
until
so
a
system
was
overthrown
she
did
not
know
how
faithfully
some
northern
men
and
northern
women
had
studied
this
subject
how
diligently
they
had
searched
out
the
cause
of
him
who
had
none
to
help
him
and
how
fearlessly
they
had
told
the
story
of
the
negro
wrongs
yes
northerners
know
thing
about
slavery
now
this
monster
of
iniquity
has
been
unveiled
to
the
world
her
frightful
features
unmasked
and
soon
very
soon
will
she
be
regarded
with
no
more
complacency
by
the
american
republic
than
is
the
idol
of
juggernaut
rolling
its
bloody
wheels
over
the
crushed
bodies
of
its
prostrate
victims
but
you
will
probably
ask
if
societies
are
not
insurrectionary
why
do
northerners
tell
us
they
are
why
i
would
ask
you
in
return
did
northern
senators
and
northern
representatives
give
their
votes
at
the
last
sitting
of
congress
to
the
admission
of
arkansas
territory
as
a
state
take
those
men
one
by
one
and
ask
them
in
their
parlours
do
you
of
slavery
ask
them
on
ground
where
they
will
speak
the
truth
and
i
doubt
not
of
them
will
tell
you
why
then
i
ask
did
give
their
votes
to
enlarge
the
mouth
of
that
grave
which
has
already
destroyed
its
tens
of
thousands
all
our
enemies
tell
they
are
as
much
as
we
are
yes
my
friends
thousands
who
are
helping
you
to
bind
the
fetters
of
slavery
on
the
negro
despise
you
in
their
hearts
for
doing
it
they
rejoice
that
such
an
institution
has
not
been
entailed
upon
them
why
then
i
would
ask
do
lend
you
their
help
i
will
tell
you
they
love
praise
of
men
than
the
praise
of
god
the
abolition
cause
has
not
yet
become
so
popular
as
to
induce
them
to
believe
that
by
advocating
it
in
congress
they
shall
sit
still
more
securely
in
their
seats
there
and
like
the
in
the
days
of
our
saviour
though
many
believed
on
him
yet
they
did
confess
him
lest
they
should
put
out
of
the
john
xii
or
perhaps
like
pilate
thinking
they
could
prevail
nothing
and
fearing
a
tumult
they
determined
to
release
barabbas
and
surrender
the
just
man
the
poor
innocent
slave
to
be
stripped
of
his
rights
and
scourged
in
vain
will
such
men
try
to
wash
their
hands
and
say
with
the
roman
governor
i
am
innocent
of
the
blood
of
this
just
person
northern
american
statesmen
are
no
more
innocent
of
the
crime
of
slavery
than
pilate
was
of
the
murder
of
jesus
or
saul
of
that
of
stephen
these
are
high
charges
but
i
appeal
to
i
appeal
to
public
opinion
ten
years
from
now
slavery
then
is
a
national
sin
but
you
will
say
a
great
many
other
northerners
tell
us
so
who
can
have
no
political
motives
the
interests
of
the
north
you
must
know
my
friends
are
very
closely
combined
with
those
of
the
south
the
northern
merchants
and
manufacturers
are
making
fortunes
out
of
the
of
slave
the
grocer
is
selling
your
rice
and
sugar
how
then
can
these
men
bear
a
testimony
against
slavery
without
condemning
themselves
but
there
is
another
reason
the
north
is
most
dreadfully
afraid
of
amalgamation
she
is
alarmed
at
the
very
idea
of
a
thing
so
monstrous
as
she
thinks
and
lest
this
consequence
flow
from
emancipation
she
is
determined
to
resist
all
efforts
at
emancipation
without
expatriation
it
is
not
because
approves
of
or
believes
it
to
be
the
corner
stone
of
our
republic
for
she
is
as
much
as
we
are
but
amalgamation
is
too
horrible
to
think
of
now
i
would
ask
is
it
right
is
it
generous
to
refuse
the
colored
people
in
this
country
the
advantages
of
education
and
the
privilege
or
rather
the
to
follow
honest
trades
and
callings
merely
because
they
are
colored
the
same
prejudice
exists
here
against
our
colored
brethren
that
existed
against
the
gentiles
in
judea
great
numbers
can
not
bear
the
idea
of
equality
and
fearing
lest
if
they
had
the
same
advantages
we
enjoy
they
would
become
as
intelligent
as
moral
as
religious
and
as
respectable
and
wealthy
they
are
determined
to
keep
them
as
low
as
they
possibly
can
is
this
doing
as
they
would
be
done
by
is
this
loving
their
neighbor
oh
that
opposers
of
abolitionism
would
put
their
souls
in
the
stead
of
the
free
colored
man
and
obey
the
apostolic
injunction
to
remember
them
that
are
in
bonds
bound
with
i
will
leave
you
to
judge
whether
the
fear
of
amalgamation
ought
to
induce
men
to
oppose
efforts
when
believe
to
be
prejudice
against
color
is
the
most
powerful
enemy
we
have
to
fight
with
at
the
north
you
need
not
be
surprised
then
at
all
at
what
is
said
abolitionists
by
the
north
for
they
are
wielding
a
sword
which
even
here
cuts
through
the
of
on
the
one
side
and
the
of
on
the
other
they
are
only
sharing
the
fate
of
other
reformers
abused
and
reviled
whilst
they
are
in
the
minority
but
they
are
neither
angry
nor
discouraged
by
the
invective
which
has
been
heaped
upon
them
by
slaveholders
at
the
south
and
their
apologists
at
the
north
they
know
that
when
george
fox
and
william
edmundson
were
laboring
in
behalf
of
the
negroes
in
the
west
indies
in
that
the
very
slanders
were
propogated
against
them
which
are
circulated
against
abolitionists
although
it
was
well
known
that
fox
was
the
founder
of
a
religious
sect
which
repudiated
war
and
violence
yet
was
accused
of
endeavoring
to
excite
the
slaves
to
insurrection
and
of
teaching
the
negroes
to
cut
their
throats
and
these
two
men
who
had
their
feet
shod
with
the
preparation
of
the
gospel
of
peace
were
actually
compelled
to
draw
up
a
formal
declaration
that
were
trying
to
raise
a
rebellion
in
barbadoes
it
is
also
worthy
of
remark
that
these
reformers
did
not
at
this
time
see
the
necessity
of
emancipation
under
seven
years
and
their
principal
efforts
were
exerted
to
persuade
the
planters
of
the
necessity
of
instructing
their
slaves
but
the
slaveholder
saw
then
just
what
the
slaveholder
sees
now
that
an
population
can
be
a
population
and
therefore
they
passed
a
law
that
negroes
should
not
even
attend
the
meetings
of
friends
abolitionists
know
that
the
life
of
clarkson
was
sought
by
slavetraders
and
that
even
wilberforce
was
denounced
on
the
floor
of
parliament
as
a
fanatic
and
a
hypocrite
by
the
present
king
of
england
the
very
man
who
in
set
his
seal
to
that
instrument
which
burst
the
fetters
of
eight
hundred
thousand
slaves
in
his
west
india
colonies
they
know
that
the
first
quaker
who
bore
a
testimony
against
the
sin
of
slavery
was
cut
off
from
religious
fellowship
with
that
society
that
quaker
was
a
on
her
deathbed
she
sent
for
the
committee
who
dealt
with
her
she
told
them
the
near
approach
of
death
had
not
altered
her
sentiments
on
the
subject
of
slavery
and
waving
her
hand
towards
a
very
fertile
and
beautiful
portion
of
country
which
lay
stretched
before
her
window
she
said
with
great
solemnity
friends
the
time
will
come
when
there
will
not
be
friends
enough
in
all
this
district
to
hold
one
meeting
for
worship
and
this
garden
will
be
turned
into
a
wilderness
the
aged
friend
who
with
tears
in
his
eyes
related
this
interesting
circumstance
to
me
remarked
that
at
that
time
there
were
seven
meetings
of
friends
in
that
part
of
virginia
but
that
when
he
was
there
ten
years
ago
not
a
single
meeting
was
held
and
the
country
was
literally
a
desolation
soon
after
her
decease
john
woolman
began
his
labors
in
our
society
and
instead
of
disowning
a
member
for
testifying
slavery
they
have
for
years
positively
forbidden
their
members
to
hold
slaves
abolitionists
understand
the
slaveholding
spirit
too
well
to
be
surprised
at
any
thing
that
has
yet
happened
at
the
south
or
the
north
they
know
that
the
greater
the
sin
is
which
is
exposed
the
more
violent
will
be
the
efforts
to
blacken
the
character
and
impugn
the
motives
of
those
who
are
engaged
in
bringing
to
light
the
hidden
things
of
darkness
they
understand
the
work
of
reform
too
well
to
be
driven
back
by
the
furious
waves
of
opposition
which
are
only
foaming
out
their
own
shame
they
have
stood
the
world
dread
laugh
when
only
twelve
men
formed
the
first
society
in
boston
in
they
have
faced
and
refuted
the
calumnies
of
their
enemies
and
proved
themselves
to
be
emphatically
by
the
violence
of
mobs
even
when
driven
by
them
from
the
temple
of
god
and
dragged
by
an
infuriated
crowd
through
the
streets
of
the
emporium
of
or
subjected
by
to
the
pain
of
corporal
punishment
none
of
these
things
move
them
and
by
the
grace
of
god
they
are
determined
to
persevere
in
this
work
of
faith
and
labor
of
love
they
mean
to
pray
and
preach
and
write
and
print
until
slavery
is
completely
overthrown
until
babylon
is
taken
up
and
cast
into
the
sea
to
be
found
no
more
at
all
they
mean
to
petition
congress
year
after
year
until
the
seat
of
our
government
is
cleansed
from
the
sinful
traffic
of
slaves
and
the
souls
of
men
although
that
august
assembly
may
be
like
the
unjust
judge
who
feared
not
god
neither
regarded
man
yet
it
must
yield
just
as
he
did
from
the
power
of
importunity
like
the
unjust
judge
congress
redress
the
wrongs
of
the
widow
lest
by
the
continual
coming
up
of
petitions
it
be
wearied
this
will
be
striking
the
dagger
into
the
very
heart
of
the
monster
and
once
is
done
he
must
soon
expire
abolitionists
have
been
accused
of
abusing
their
southern
brethren
did
the
prophet
isaiah
the
jews
when
he
addressed
to
them
the
cutting
reproofs
contained
in
the
first
chapter
of
his
prophecies
and
ended
by
telling
them
they
would
be
of
the
oaks
they
had
desired
and
for
the
garden
they
had
chosen
did
john
the
baptist
the
jews
when
he
called
them
generation
of
and
warned
them
to
bring
forth
fruits
meet
for
repentance
did
peter
abuse
the
jews
when
he
told
them
they
were
the
of
the
lord
of
glory
did
paul
abuse
the
roman
governor
when
he
reasoned
before
him
of
righteousness
temperance
and
judgment
so
as
to
send
conviction
home
to
his
guilty
heart
and
cause
him
to
tremble
in
view
of
the
crimes
he
was
living
in
surely
not
no
man
will
now
accuse
the
prophets
and
apostles
of
but
what
have
abolitionists
done
more
than
they
no
doubt
the
jews
thought
the
prophets
and
apostles
in
their
day
just
as
harsh
and
uncharitable
as
slaveholders
now
think
abolitionists
if
they
did
not
why
did
they
beat
and
stone
and
kill
them
great
fault
has
been
found
with
the
prints
which
have
been
employed
to
expose
slavery
at
the
north
but
my
friends
how
could
this
be
done
so
effectually
in
any
other
way
until
the
pictures
of
the
sufferings
were
drawn
and
held
up
to
public
gaze
no
northerner
had
any
idea
of
the
cruelty
of
the
system
it
never
entered
their
minds
that
such
abominations
could
exist
in
christian
republican
america
they
never
suspected
that
many
of
the
and
who
came
from
the
south
to
spend
the
summer
months
in
travelling
among
them
were
petty
tyrants
at
home
and
those
who
had
lived
at
the
south
and
came
to
reside
at
the
north
were
too
of
even
to
speak
of
it
the
language
of
their
hearts
was
tell
it
in
gath
publish
it
in
the
streets
of
askelon
they
saw
no
use
in
uncovering
the
loathsome
body
to
popular
sight
and
in
hopeless
despair
wept
in
secret
places
over
the
sins
of
oppression
to
such
hidden
mourners
the
formation
of
societies
was
as
life
from
the
dead
the
first
beams
of
hope
which
gleamed
through
the
dark
clouds
of
despondency
and
grief
prints
were
made
use
of
to
effect
the
abolition
of
the
inquisition
in
spain
and
clarkson
employed
them
when
he
was
laboring
to
break
up
the
slave
trade
and
english
abolitionists
used
them
just
as
we
are
now
doing
they
are
powerful
appeals
and
have
invariably
done
the
work
they
were
designed
to
do
and
we
can
not
consent
to
abandon
the
use
of
these
until
the
no
longer
exist
with
regard
to
those
white
men
who
it
was
said
did
try
to
raise
an
insurrection
in
mississippi
a
year
ago
and
who
were
stated
to
be
abolitionists
none
of
them
were
proved
to
be
members
of
societies
and
it
must
remain
a
matter
of
great
doubt
whether
even
they
were
guilty
of
the
crimes
alledged
against
them
because
when
any
community
is
thrown
into
such
a
panic
as
to
inflict
lynch
law
upon
accused
persons
they
can
not
be
supposed
to
be
capable
of
judging
with
calmness
and
impartiality
that
the
papers
of
which
the
charleston
mail
was
robbed
were
insurrectionary
and
that
they
were
sent
to
the
colored
people
as
was
reported
that
amos
dresser
was
though
he
was
accused
of
being
so
and
on
this
false
accusation
was
publicly
whipped
in
nashville
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
of
infuriated
was
that
young
man
disgraced
by
this
infliction
of
corporal
punishment
no
more
than
was
the
great
apostle
of
the
gentiles
who
five
times
received
forty
stripes
save
one
like
him
he
might
have
said
henceforth
i
bear
in
my
body
the
marks
of
the
lord
jesus
for
it
was
for
the
sake
he
as
much
as
did
the
apostle
paul
are
nelson
and
garrett
and
williams
and
other
abolitionists
who
have
recently
been
banished
from
missouri
insurrectionists
they
are
whatever
slaveholders
may
choose
to
call
them
the
spirit
which
now
asperses
the
character
of
the
abolitionists
is
the
which
dressed
up
the
christians
of
spain
in
the
skins
of
wild
beasts
and
pictures
of
devils
when
they
were
led
to
execution
as
heretics
before
we
condemn
individuals
it
is
necessary
even
in
a
wicked
community
to
accuse
them
of
some
crime
hence
when
jezebel
wished
to
compass
the
death
of
naboth
men
of
belial
were
suborned
to
bear
witness
against
him
and
so
it
was
with
stephen
and
so
it
ever
has
been
and
ever
will
be
as
long
as
there
is
any
virtue
to
suffer
on
the
rack
or
the
gallows
witnesses
must
appear
against
abolitionists
before
they
can
be
condemned
i
will
now
say
a
few
words
on
george
thompson
mission
to
this
country
this
philanthropist
was
accused
of
being
a
foreign
emissary
were
la
fayette
and
steuben
and
de
kalb
foreign
emissaries
when
they
came
over
to
america
to
fight
against
the
tories
who
preferred
submitting
to
what
was
termed
the
yoke
of
servitude
rather
than
bursting
the
fetters
which
bound
them
to
the
mother
country
came
with
to
engage
in
conflict
against
american
citizens
and
yet
where
do
their
names
stand
on
the
page
of
history
among
the
honorable
or
the
low
thompson
came
here
to
war
against
the
giant
sin
of
slavery
with
the
sword
and
the
pistol
but
with
the
smooth
stones
of
oratory
taken
from
the
pure
waters
of
the
river
of
truth
his
splendid
talents
and
commanding
eloquence
rendered
him
a
powerful
coadjutor
in
the
cause
and
in
order
to
neutralize
the
effects
of
these
upon
his
auditors
and
rob
the
poor
slave
of
the
benefits
of
his
labors
his
character
was
defamed
his
life
was
sought
and
he
at
last
driven
from
our
republic
as
a
fugitive
but
was
disgraced
by
all
this
mean
and
contemptible
and
wicked
chicanery
and
malice
no
more
than
was
paul
when
in
consequence
of
a
vision
he
had
seen
at
troas
he
went
over
to
macedonia
to
help
the
christians
there
and
was
beaten
and
imprisoned
because
he
cast
out
a
spirit
of
divination
from
a
young
damsel
which
had
brought
much
gain
to
her
masters
paul
was
as
much
a
in
the
roman
colony
of
philippi
as
george
thompson
was
in
america
and
it
was
because
he
was
a
and
taught
customs
it
was
not
lawful
for
them
to
receive
or
observe
being
romans
that
the
apostle
was
thus
treated
it
was
said
thompson
was
a
felon
who
had
fled
to
this
country
to
escape
transportation
to
new
holland
look
at
him
now
pouring
the
thundering
strains
of
his
eloquence
upon
crowded
audiences
in
great
britain
and
see
in
this
a
triumphant
vindication
of
his
character
and
have
the
slaveholder
and
his
obsequious
apologist
gained
any
thing
by
all
their
violence
and
falsehood
no
for
the
stone
which
struck
goliath
of
gath
had
already
been
thrown
from
the
sling
the
giant
of
slavery
who
had
so
proudly
defied
the
armies
of
the
living
god
had
received
his
before
he
left
our
shores
but
what
is
george
thompson
doing
there
is
he
not
now
laboring
there
as
effectually
to
abolish
american
slavery
as
though
he
trod
our
own
soil
and
lectured
to
new
york
or
boston
assemblies
what
is
he
doing
there
but
constructing
a
stupendous
dam
which
will
turn
the
overwhelming
tide
of
public
opinion
over
the
wheels
of
that
machinery
which
abolitionists
are
working
here
he
is
now
lecturing
to
on
to
the
of
a
on
the
abject
condition
of
the
of
a
he
is
telling
them
of
that
mighty
confederacy
of
petty
tyrants
which
extends
ever
thirteen
states
of
our
union
he
is
telling
them
of
the
munificent
rewards
offered
by
slaveholders
for
the
heads
of
the
most
distinguished
advocates
for
freedom
in
this
country
he
is
moving
the
british
churches
to
send
out
to
the
churches
of
america
the
most
solemn
appeals
reproving
rebuking
and
exhorting
them
with
all
long
suffering
and
patience
to
abandon
the
sin
of
slavery
immediately
where
then
i
ask
will
the
name
of
george
thompson
stand
on
the
page
of
history
among
the
honorable
or
the
base
what
can
i
say
more
my
friends
to
induce
to
set
your
hands
and
heads
and
hearts
to
this
great
work
of
justice
and
mercy
perhaps
you
have
feared
the
consequences
of
immediate
emancipation
and
been
frightened
by
all
those
dreadful
prophecies
of
rebellion
bloodshed
and
murder
which
have
been
uttered
let
no
man
deceive
you
they
are
the
predictions
of
that
same
lying
spirit
which
spoke
through
the
four
thousand
prophets
of
old
to
ahab
king
of
israel
urging
him
on
to
destruction
may
produce
these
horrible
scenes
if
it
is
continued
five
years
longer
but
emancipation
i
can
prove
the
of
immediate
emancipation
by
history
in
domingo
in
six
hundred
thousand
slaves
were
set
free
in
a
white
population
of
thousand
that
island
marched
as
by
enchantment
towards
its
ancient
splendor
cultivation
prospered
every
day
produced
perceptible
proofs
of
its
progress
and
the
negroes
all
continued
quietly
to
work
on
the
different
plantations
until
in
france
determined
to
reduce
these
liberated
slaves
again
to
bondage
it
was
at
that
all
those
dreadful
scenes
of
cruelty
occurred
which
we
so
often
hear
spoken
of
as
the
effects
of
abolition
they
were
occasioned
by
emancipation
but
by
the
base
attempt
to
fasten
the
chains
of
slavery
on
the
limbs
of
liberated
slaves
in
guadaloupe
thousand
slaves
were
freed
in
a
white
population
of
thirteen
thousand
the
same
prosperous
effects
followed
manumission
here
that
had
attended
it
in
hayti
every
thing
was
quiet
until
buonaparte
sent
out
a
fleet
to
reduce
these
negroes
again
to
slavery
and
in
this
institution
was
in
that
island
in
when
great
britain
determined
to
liberate
the
slaves
in
her
west
india
colonies
and
proposed
the
apprenticeship
system
the
planters
of
bermuda
and
antigua
after
having
joined
the
other
planters
in
their
representations
of
the
bloody
consequences
of
emancipation
in
order
if
possible
to
hold
back
the
hand
which
was
offering
the
boon
of
freedom
to
the
poor
negro
as
soon
as
they
found
such
falsehoods
were
utterly
disregarded
and
abolition
must
take
place
came
forward
voluntarily
and
asked
for
the
compensation
which
was
due
to
them
saying
preferred
immediate
and
were
not
afraid
of
any
insurrection
and
how
is
it
with
these
islands
now
they
are
decidedly
more
prosperous
than
any
of
those
in
which
the
apprenticeship
system
was
adopted
and
england
is
now
trying
to
abolish
that
system
so
fully
convinced
is
she
that
immediate
emancipation
is
the
and
the
best
plan
and
why
not
try
it
in
the
southern
states
if
it
has
occasioned
rebellion
if
a
drop
of
has
ever
been
shed
in
consequence
of
it
though
it
has
been
so
often
tried
why
should
we
suppose
it
would
produce
such
disastrous
consequences
now
be
not
deceived
then
god
is
not
mocked
by
such
false
excuses
for
not
doing
justly
and
loving
mercy
there
is
nothing
to
fear
from
immediate
emancipation
but
from
the
continuance
of
slavery
sisters
in
christ
i
have
done
as
a
southerner
i
have
felt
it
was
my
duty
to
address
you
i
have
endeavoured
to
set
before
you
the
exceeding
sinfulness
of
slavery
and
to
point
you
to
the
example
of
those
noble
women
who
have
been
raised
up
in
the
church
to
effect
great
revolutions
and
to
suffer
for
the
truth
sake
i
have
appealed
to
your
sympathies
as
women
to
your
sense
of
duty
as
i
have
attempted
to
vindicate
the
abolitionists
to
prove
the
entire
safety
of
immediate
emancipation
and
to
plead
the
cause
of
the
poor
and
oppressed
i
have
done
i
have
sowed
the
seeds
of
truth
but
i
well
know
that
even
if
an
apollos
were
to
follow
in
my
steps
to
water
them
can
give
the
increase
to
him
then
who
is
able
to
prosper
the
work
of
his
servant
hand
i
commend
this
appeal
in
fervent
prayer
that
as
he
hath
the
weak
things
of
the
to
confound
the
things
which
are
mighty
so
he
may
cause
his
blessing
to
descend
and
carry
conviction
to
the
hearts
of
many
lydias
through
these
speaking
pages
count
me
not
your
enemy
because
i
have
told
you
the
truth
but
believe
me
in
unfeigned
affection
your
sympathizing

to

think
not

thyself
that
thou

more
than

esther
bade
them
return
mordecai
this

and
so
will
i
go
in
unto
the
king
which
is
not
according
to
law
and
i
perish
i
esther
iv
respected
friends
it
is
because
i
feel
a
deep
and
tender
interest
in
your
present
and
eternal
welfare
that
i
am
willing
thus
publicly
to
address
you
some
of
you
have
loved
me
as
a
relative
and
some
have
felt
bound
to
me
in
christian
sympathy
and
gospel
fellowship
and
even
when
compelled
by
a
strong
sense
of
duty
to
break
those
outward
bonds
of
union
which
bound
us
together
as
members
of
the
same
community
and
members
of
the
same
religious
denomination
you
were
generous
enough
to
give
me
credit
for
sincerity
as
a
christian
though
you
believed
i
had
been
most
strangely
deceived
i
thanked
you
then
for
your
kindness
and
i
ask
you
for
the
sake
of
former
confidence
and
former
friendship
to
read
the
following
pages
in
the
spirit
of
calm
investigation
and
fervent
prayer
it
is
because
you
have
known
me
that
i
write
thus
unto
you
but
there
are
other
christian
women
scattered
over
the
southern
states
of
whom
a
very
large
number
have
never
seen
me
and
never
heard
my
name
and
feel
personal
interest
whatever
in
but
i
feel
an
interest
in
as
branches
of
the
same
vine
from
whose
root
i
daily
draw
the
principle
of
spiritual
vitality
yes
sisters
in
christ
i
feel
an
interest
in
and
often
has
the
secret
prayer
arisen
on
your
behalf
lord
open
thou
their
eyes
that
they
may
see
wondrous
things
out
of
thy
law
it
is
then
because
i
and
for
you
that
i
thus
address
you
upon
a
subject
about
which
of
all
others
perhaps
you
would
rather
not
hear
any
thing
but
would
to
god
ye
could
bear
with
me
a
little
in
my
folly
and
indeed
bear
with
me
for
i
am
jealous
over
you
with
godly
jealousy
be
not
afraid
then
to
read
my
appeal
it
is
written
in
the
heat
of
passion
or
prejudice
but
in
that
solemn
calmness
which
is
the
result
of
conviction
and
duty
it
is
true
i
am
going
to
tell
you
unwelcome
truths
but
i
mean
to
speak
these
in
and
remember
solomon
says
faithful
are
the
of
a
friend
i
do
not
believe
the
time
has
yet
come
when
will
not
endure
sound
doctrine
even
on
the
subject
of
slavery
if
it
is
spoken
to
them
in
tenderness
and
love
therefore
i
now
address
this
periodical
contains
four
and
a
half
sheets
postage
under
miles
cents
over
miles
cents
read
and
to
all
of
you
then
known
or
unknown
relatives
or
strangers
for
you
are
all
in
christ
i
would
speak
i
have
felt
for
you
at
this
time
when
unwelcome
light
is
pouring
in
upon
the
world
on
the
subject
of
slavery
light
which
even
christians
would
exclude
if
they
could
from
our
country
or
at
any
rate
from
the
southern
portion
of
it
saying
as
its
rays
strike
the
rock
bound
coasts
of
new
england
and
scatter
their
warmth
and
radiance
over
her
hills
and
valleys
and
from
thence
travel
onward
over
the
palisades
of
the
hudson
and
down
the
soft
flowing
waters
of
the
delaware
and
gild
the
waves
of
the
potomac
hitherto
shalt
thou
come
and
no
further
i
know
that
even
professors
of
his
name
who
has
been
emphatically
called
the
light
of
the
world
would
if
they
could
build
a
wall
of
adamant
around
the
southern
states
whose
top
might
reach
unto
heaven
in
order
to
shut
out
the
light
which
is
bounding
from
mountain
to
mountain
and
from
the
hills
to
the
plains
and
valleys
beneath
through
the
vast
extent
of
our
northern
states
but
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
their
attempts
will
be
as
utterly
fruitless
as
were
the
efforts
of
the
builders
of
babel
and
why
because
moral
like
natural
light
is
so
extremely
subtle
in
its
nature
as
to
overleap
all
human
barriers
and
laugh
at
the
puny
efforts
of
man
to
control
it
all
the
excuses
and
palliations
of
this
system
must
inevitably
be
swept
away
just
as
other
refuges
of
lies
have
been
by
the
irresistible
torrent
of
a
rectified
public
opinion
the
of
the
slave
system
says
jonathan
dymond
in
his
admirable
work
on
the
principles
of
morality
will
be
regarded
with
the
public
feeling
as
he
who
was
an
advocate
for
the
slave
trade
is
it
will
be
and
that
very
soon
clearly
perceived
and
fully
acknowledged
by
all
the
virtuous
and
the
candid
that
in
it
is
as
sinful
to
hold
a
human
being
in
bondage
who
has
been
born
in
carolina
as
one
who
has
been
born
in
africa
all
that
sophistry
of
argument
which
has
been
employed
to
prove
that
although
it
is
sinful
to
send
to
africa
to
procure
men
and
women
as
slaves
who
have
never
been
in
slavery
that
still
it
is
not
sinful
to
keep
those
in
bondage
who
have
come
down
by
inheritance
will
be
utterly
overthrown
we
must
come
back
to
the
good
old
doctrine
of
our
forefathers
who
declared
to
the
world
this
self
evident
truth
that
men
are
created
equal
and
that
they
have
certain
rights
among
which
are
life
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
it
is
even
a
greater
absurdity
to
suppose
a
man
can
be
legally
born
a
slave
under
free
government
than
under
the
petty
despotisms
of
barbarian
africa
if
then
we
have
no
right
to
enslave
an
african
surely
we
can
have
none
to
enslave
an
american
if
it
is
a
self
evident
truth
that
men
every
where
and
of
every
color
are
born
equal
and
have
an
right
to
then
it
is
equally
true
that
man
can
be
born
a
slave
and
no
man
can
ever
be
reduced
to
bondage
and
held
as
a
slave
however
fair
may
be
the
claim
of
his
master
or
mistress
through
wills
and
but
after
all
it
may
be
said
our
fathers
were
certainly
mistaken
for
the
bible
sanctions
slavery
and
that
is
the
highest
authority
now
the
bible
is
my
ultimate
appeal
in
all
matters
of
faith
and
practice
and
it
is
to
i
am
anxious
to
bring
the
subject
at
issue
between
us
let
us
then
begin
with
adam
and
examine
the
charter
of
privileges
which
was
given
to
him
have
dominion
over
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
over
the
fowl
of
the
air
and
over
every
living
thing
that
moveth
upon
the
earth
in
the
eighth
psalm
we
have
a
still
fuller
description
of
this
charter
which
through
adam
was
given
to
all
mankind
thou
madest
him
to
have
dominion
over
the
works
of
thy
hands
thou
hast
put
all
things
under
his
feet
all
sheep
and
oxen
yea
and
the
beasts
of
the
field
the
fowl
of
the
air
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
whatsoever
passeth
through
the
paths
of
the
seas
and
after
the
flood
when
this
charter
of
human
rights
was
renewed
we
find
power
vested
in
man
and
the
fear
of
you
and
the
dread
of
you
shall
be
upon
every
beast
of
the
earth
and
every
fowl
of
the
air
and
upon
all
that
moveth
upon
the
earth
and
upon
all
the
fishes
of
the
sea
into
your
hand
are
they
delivered
in
this
charter
although
the
different
kinds
of
beings
are
so
particularly
enumerated
and
supreme
dominion
over
of
is
granted
yet
is
vested
with
this
dominion
his
fellow
he
was
never
told
that
any
of
the
human
species
were
put
his
it
was
only
and
man
who
was
created
in
the
image
of
his
maker
can
properly
be
termed
a
though
the
laws
of
slave
states
do
call
him
a
chattel
personal
then
i
assert
was
put
the
feet
of
by
that
first
charter
of
human
right
which
was
given
by
god
to
the
fathers
of
the
antediluvian
and
postdiluvian
worlds
therefore
this
doctrine
of
equality
is
based
on
the
bible
but
it
may
be
argued
that
in
the
very
chapter
of
genesis
from
which
i
have
last
quoted
will
be
found
the
curse
pronounced
upon
canaan
by
which
his
posterity
was
consigned
to
servitude
under
his
brothers
shem
and
japheth
i
know
this
prophecy
was
uttered
and
was
most
fearfully
and
wonderfully
fulfilled
through
the
immediate
descendants
of
canaan
the
canaanites
and
i
do
not
know
but
it
has
been
through
all
the
children
of
ham
but
i
do
know
that
prophecy
does
tell
us
what
to
but
what
actually
does
take
place
ages
after
it
has
been
delivered
and
that
if
we
justify
america
for
enslaving
the
children
of
africa
we
must
also
justify
egypt
for
reducing
the
children
of
israel
to
bondage
for
the
latter
was
foretold
as
explicitly
as
the
former
i
am
well
aware
that
prophecy
has
often
been
urged
as
an
excuse
for
slavery
but
be
not
deceived
the
fulfilment
of
prophecy
will
cover
one
in
the
awful
day
of
account
hear
what
our
saviour
says
on
this
subject
it
must
needs
be
that
offences
come
but
unto
that
man
through
whom
they
witness
some
fulfilment
of
this
declaration
in
the
tremendous
destruction
of
jerusalem
occasioned
by
that
most
nefarious
of
all
crimes
the
crucifixion
of
the
son
of
god
did
the
fact
of
that
event
having
been
foretold
exculpate
the
jews
from
sin
in
perpetrating
it
no
for
hear
what
the
apostle
peter
says
to
them
on
this
subject
him
being
delivered
by
the
determinate
counsel
and
foreknowledge
of
god
have
taken
and
by
hands
have
crucified
and
slain
other
striking
instances
might
be
adduced
but
these
will
suffice
but
it
has
been
urged
that
the
patriarchs
held
slaves
and
therefore
slavery
is
right
do
you
really
believe
that
patriarchal
servitude
was
like
american
slavery
can
you
believe
it
if
so
read
the
history
of
these
primitive
fathers
of
the
church
and
be
undeceived
look
at
abraham
though
so
great
a
man
going
to
the
herd
himself
and
fetching
a
calf
from
thence
and
serving
it
up
with
his
own
hands
for
the
entertainment
of
his
guests
look
at
sarah
that
princess
as
her
name
signifies
baking
cakes
upon
the
hearth
if
the
servants
they
had
were
like
southern
slaves
would
they
have
performed
such
comparatively
menial
offices
for
themselves
hear
too
the
plaintive
lamentation
of
abraham
when
he
feared
he
should
have
no
son
to
bear
his
name
down
to
posterity
behold
thou
hast
given
me
no
seed
one
born
in
my
house
is
heir
from
this
it
appears
that
one
of
his
was
to
inherit
his
immense
estate
is
this
like
southern
slavery
i
leave
it
to
your
own
good
sense
and
candor
to
decide
besides
such
was
the
footing
upon
which
abraham
was
with
servants
that
he
trusted
them
with
arms
are
slaveholders
willing
to
put
swords
and
pistols
into
the
hands
of
their
slaves
he
was
as
a
father
among
his
servants
what
are
planters
and
masters
generally
among
theirs
when
the
institution
of
circumcision
was
established
abraham
was
commanded
thus
he
that
is
eight
days
old
shall
be
circumcised
among
you
in
your
generations
he
that
is
born
in
the
house
or
bought
with
money
of
any
stranger
which
is
not
of
thy
seed
and
to
render
this
command
with
regard
to
his
still
more
impressive
it
is
repeated
in
the
very
next
verse
and
herein
we
may
perceive
the
great
care
which
was
taken
by
god
to
guard
the
of
even
under
this
dark
dispensation
what
too
was
the
testimony
given
to
the
faithfulness
of
this
eminent
patriarch
for
i
know
him
that
he
will
command
his
children
and
his
after
him
and
they
shall
keep
the
way
of
the
lord
to
do
justice
and
judgment
now
my
dear
friends
many
of
you
believe
that
circumcision
has
been
superseded
by
baptism
in
the
church
careful
to
have
that
are
born
in
your
house
or
bought
with
money
of
any
stranger
baptized
are
as
faithful
as
abraham
to
command
to
the
way
of
the
lord
i
leave
it
to
your
own
consciences
to
decide
was
patriarchal
servitude
then
like
american
slavery
but
i
shall
be
told
god
sanctioned
slavery
yea
commanded
slavery
under
the
jewish
dispensation
let
us
examine
this
subject
calmly
and
prayerfully
i
admit
that
a
species
of
was
permitted
to
the
jews
but
in
studying
the
subject
i
have
been
struck
with
wonder
and
admiration
at
perceiving
how
carefully
the
servant
was
guarded
from
violence
injustice
and
wrong
i
will
first
inform
you
how
these
servants
became
servants
for
i
think
this
a
very
important
part
of
our
subject
from
consulting
horne
calmet
and
the
bible
i
find
there
were
six
different
ways
by
which
the
hebrews
became
servants
legally
a
hebrew
whose
father
was
still
alive
and
who
on
that
account
had
not
inherited
his
patrimonial
estate
might
sell
himself
his
services
for
six
years
in
which
case
received
the
purchase
money
ex
xxi
a
father
might
sell
his
children
as
servants
his
in
which
circumstance
it
was
understood
the
daughter
was
to
be
the
wife
or
of
the
man
who
bought
her
and
the
received
the
price
in
other
words
jewish
women
were
sold
as
were
in
the
first
settlement
of
virginia
as
as
slaves
ex
xxi
thieves
not
able
to
make
restitution
for
their
thefts
were
sold
for
the
benefit
of
the
injured
person
ex
xxii
they
might
be
born
in
servitude
ex
xxi
if
reduced
to
extreme
poverty
a
hebrew
might
sell
himself
but
in
such
a
case
he
was
to
serve
not
as
a
bondsman
whose
term
of
service
was
only
six
years
nor
was
he
to
serve
as
a
hired
servant
who
received
his
wages
every
evening
nor
yet
as
a
sojourner
or
temporary
resident
in
the
family
but
he
was
to
serve
his
master
until
the
year
of
jubilee
a
lev
xxv
footnote
a
if
the
reader
will
leave
out
the
italicised
words
but
and
and
in
the
verse
he
will
find
that
i
am
fully
authorized
in
the
meaning
i
have
attached
to
it
but
and
and
are
in
the
original
hebrew
have
been
introduced
by
the
translators
and
entirely
destroy
the
true
sense
of
the
passage
if
a
hebrew
had
sold
himself
to
a
rich
gentile
he
might
be
redeemed
by
one
of
his
brethren
at
any
time
the
money
was
offered
and
he
who
redeemed
him
was
to
take
advantage
of
the
favor
thus
conferred
and
rule
over
him
with
rigor
lev
xxv
before
going
into
an
examination
of
the
laws
by
which
these
servants
were
protected
i
would
just
ask
whether
american
slaves
have
become
slaves
in
any
of
the
ways
in
which
the
hebrews
became
servants
did
they
sell
themselves
into
slavery
and
receive
the
purchase
money
into
their
own
hands
no
no
did
they
steal
the
property
of
another
and
were
they
sold
to
make
restitution
for
their
crimes
no
did
their
present
masters
as
an
act
of
kindness
redeem
them
from
some
heathen
tyrant
to
whom
had
sold
in
the
dark
hour
of
adversity
no
were
they
born
in
slavery
no
no
not
according
to
for
the
servants
who
were
born
in
servitude
among
them
were
born
of
parents
who
had
ex
xxi
lev
xxv
were
the
female
slaves
of
the
south
sold
by
their
fathers
how
shall
i
answer
this
question
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
never
were
fathers
have
received
the
poor
compensation
of
silver
or
gold
for
the
tears
and
toils
the
suffering
and
anguish
and
hopeless
bondage
of
daughters
they
labor
day
by
day
and
year
by
year
side
by
side
in
the
same
field
if
haply
their
daughters
are
permitted
to
remain
on
the
same
plantation
with
them
instead
of
being
as
they
often
are
separated
from
their
parents
and
sold
into
distant
states
never
again
to
meet
on
earth
but
do
the
of
the
south
ever
sell
their
daughters
my
heart
beats
and
my
hand
trembles
as
i
write
the
awful
affirmative
yes
the
fathers
of
this
christian
land
often
sell
their
daughters
as
jewish
parents
did
to
be
the
wives
and
of
the
men
who
buy
them
but
to
be
the
abject
slaves
of
petty
tyrants
and
irresponsible
masters
is
it
not
so
my
friends
i
leave
it
to
your
own
candor
to
corroborate
my
assertion
southern
slaves
then
have
become
slaves
in
any
of
the
six
different
ways
in
which
hebrews
became
servants
and
i
hesitate
not
to
say
that
american
masters
according
to
substantiate
their
claim
to
the
men
women
or
children
they
now
hold
in
bondage
but
there
was
one
way
in
which
a
jew
might
illegally
be
reduced
to
servitude
it
was
this
he
might
be
and
afterwards
sold
as
a
slave
as
was
joseph
to
guard
most
effectually
against
this
dreadful
crime
of
manstealing
god
enacted
this
severe
law
he
that
stealeth
a
man
and
selleth
him
or
if
he
be
found
in
his
hand
he
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
and
again
if
a
man
be
found
stealing
any
of
his
brethren
of
the
children
of
israel
and
maketh
merchandise
of
him
or
selleth
him
then
thief
shall
and
thou
shalt
put
away
evil
from
among
you
deut
xxiv
as
i
have
tried
american
slavery
by
hebrew
servitude
and
found
to
your
surprise
perhaps
that
jewish
law
can
not
justify
the
slaveholder
claim
let
us
now
try
it
by
hebrew
bondage
have
the
southern
slaves
then
been
stolen
if
they
did
not
sell
themselves
into
bondage
if
they
were
not
sold
as
thieves
if
they
were
not
redeemed
from
a
heathen
master
to
whom
had
sold
themselves
if
they
were
not
born
in
servitude
according
to
hebrew
law
and
if
the
females
were
not
sold
by
their
fathers
as
wives
and
to
those
who
purchased
them
then
what
shall
we
say
of
them
what
can
we
say
of
them
but
that
according
hebrew
law
they
have
been
but
i
shall
be
told
that
the
jews
had
other
servants
who
were
absolute
slaves
let
us
look
a
little
into
this
also
they
had
other
servants
who
were
procured
from
the
heathen
bondmen
and
bondmaids
might
be
bought
of
the
heathen
round
about
them
lev
xxv
i
will
now
try
the
right
of
the
southern
planter
by
the
claims
of
hebrew
masters
to
their
servants
were
the
southern
slaves
bought
from
the
heathen
no
for
surely
no
one
will
vindicate
the
so
far
as
to
assert
that
slaves
were
bought
from
the
heathen
who
were
obtained
by
that
system
of
piracy
the
only
excuse
for
holding
southern
slaves
is
that
they
were
born
in
slavery
but
we
have
seen
that
they
were
born
in
servitude
as
jewish
servants
were
and
that
the
children
of
heathen
servants
were
not
legally
subjected
to
bondage
even
under
the
mosaic
law
how
then
have
the
slaves
of
the
south
been
obtained
i
will
next
proceed
to
an
examination
of
those
laws
which
were
enacted
in
order
to
protect
the
hebrew
and
the
heathen
servant
for
i
wish
you
to
understand
that
were
protected
by
him
of
whom
it
is
said
his
mercies
are
over
his
works
i
will
first
speak
of
those
which
secured
the
rights
of
hebrew
servants
this
code
was
headed
thus
thou
shalt
rule
over
him
with

shalt
fear
thy
god
if
thou
buy
a
hebrew
servant
six
years
shall
he
serve
and
in
the
seventh
year
he
shall
go
out
free
for
nothing
ex
xxi
and
when
thou
sendest
him
out
free
from
thee
thou
shalt
not
let
him
go
away
empty
thou
shalt
furnish
him
out
of
thy
flock
and
out
of
thy
floor
and
out
of
thy

wherewith
the
lord
thy
god
hath
blessed
thee
shalt
thou
give
unto
him

if
he
come
in
by
himself
he
shall
go
out
by
himself
if
he
were
married
then
his
wife
shall
go
out
with
him
ex
xxi
if
his
master
have
given
him
a
wife
and
she
have
borne
him
sons
and
daughters
the
wife
and
her
children
shall
be
his
master
and
he
shall
go
out
by
himself
ex
xxi
if
the
servant
shall
plainly
say
i
love
my
master
my
wife
and
my
children
i
will
not
go
out
free
then
his
master
shall
bring
him
unto
the
judges
and
he
shall
bring
him
to
the
door
or
unto
the
and
his
master
shall
bore
his
ear
through
with
an
awl
and
he
shall
serve
him
ex

if
a
man
smite
the
eye
of
his
servant
or
the
eye
of
his
maid
that
it
perish

if
a
man
smite
his

ex
xxi
from
these
laws
we
learn
that
one
class
of
hebrew
men
servants
were
bound
to
serve
their
masters
years
unless
their
attachment
to
their
employers
their
wives
and
children
should
induce
them
to
wish
to
remain
in
servitude
in
which
case
in
order
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
deception
on
the
part
of
the
master
the
servant
was
first
taken
before
the
magistrate
where
he
openly
declared
his
intention
of
continuing
in
his
master
service
probably
a
public
register
was
kept
of
such
he
was
then
conducted
to
the
door
of
the
house
in
warm
climates
doors
are
thrown
open
and
his
ear
was
bored
and
by
submitting
to
this
operation
he
testified
his
willingness
to
serve
him
in
subserviency
to
the
law
of
god
for
let
it
be
remembered
that
the
was
covered
with
the
precepts
of
that
law
deut
vi
xi
during
his
life
for
jewish
rabbins
who
must
have
understood
jewish
as
it
is
called
affirm
that
servants
were
set
free
at
the
death
of
their
masters
and
did
descend
to
their
heirs
or
that
he
was
to
serve
him
until
the
year
of
jubilee
when
servants
were
set
at
liberty
the
other
class
when
they
first
sold
themselves
agreed
to
remain
until
the
year
of
jubilee
to
protect
servants
from
violence
it
was
ordained
that
if
a
master
struck
out
the
tooth
or
destroyed
the
eye
of
a
servant
that
servant
immediately
became
for
such
an
act
of
violence
evidently
showed
he
was
unfit
to
possess
the
power
of
a
master
and
therefore
that
power
was
taken
from
him
all
servants
enjoyed
the
rest
of
the
sabbath
and
partook
of
the
privileges
and
festivities
of
the
three
great
jewish
feasts
and
if
a
servant
died
under
the
infliction
of
chastisement
his
master
was
surely
to
be
punished
as
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
and
life
for
life
was
the
jewish
law
of
course
he
was
punished
with
death
i
know
that
great
stress
has
been
laid
upon
the
following
verse
notwithstanding
if
he
continue
a
day
or
two
he
shall
not
be
punished
for
he
is
his
money
slaveholders
and
the
apologists
of
slavery
have
eagerly
seized
upon
this
little
passage
of
scripture
and
held
it
up
as
the
masters
magna
charta
by
which
they
were
licensed
by
god
himself
to
commit
the
greatest
outrages
upon
the
defenceless
victims
of
their
oppression
but
my
friends
was
it
designed
to
be
so
if
our
heavenly
father
would
protect
by
law
the
and
the
of
a
hebrew
servant
can
we
for
a
moment
believe
that
he
would
abandon
that
same
servant
to
the
brutal
rage
of
a
master
who
would
destroy
even
life
itself
let
us
then
examine
this
passage
with
the
help
of
the
context
in
the
and
verses
we
have
a
law
which
was
made
for
who
strove
together
here
we
find
that
if
one
man
smote
another
so
that
he
died
not
but
only
kept
his
bed
from
being
disabled
and
he
rose
again
and
walked
abroad
upon
his
staff
then
was
to
be
paid
for
the
loss
of
his
time
and
all
the
expenses
of
his
sickness
were
to
be
borne
by
the
man
who
smote
him
the
freeman
time
was
and
therefore
he
was
to
be
remunerated
for
the
loss
of
it
but
so
with
the
whose
time
was
as
it
were
money
of
his
because
he
had
already
paid
for
it
if
he
continued
a
day
or
two
after
being
struck
to
keep
his
bed
in
consequence
of
any
wound
received
then
his
lost
time
was
to
be
paid
for
because
it
was
his
but
his
master
who
had
already
paid
him
for
it
the
loss
of
his
time
was
the
and
the
servant
this
explanation
is
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
the
hebrew
word
translated
continue
means
to
stand
still
to
be
unable
to
go
out
about
his
master
work
here
then
we
find
this
stronghold
of
slavery
completely
demolished
instead
of
its
being
a
license
to
inflict
such
chastisement
upon
a
servant
as
to
cause
even
death
itself
it
is
in
fact
a
law
merely
to
provide
that
a
man
should
not
be
required
to
pay
his
servant
twice
over
for
his
time
it
is
altogether
an
unfounded
assumption
on
the
part
of
the
slaveholder
that
this
servant
after
a
day
or
two
the
text
does
not
say
so
and
i
contend
that
he
after
a
day
or
two
just
as
the
man
mentioned
in
the
verse
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
blows
he
received
the
cases
are
completely
parallel
and
the
first
law
throws
great
light
on
the
second
this
explanation
is
far
more
consonant
with
the
character
of
god
and
were
it
not
that
our
vision
has
been
so
completely
darkened
by
the
existence
of
slavery
in
our
country
we
never
could
so
far
have
dishonored
him
as
to
have
supposed
that
he
sanctioned
the
murder
of
a
servant
although
slaveholding
legislators
might
legalize
the
killing
of
a
slave
in
different
sketch
of
slave
but
i
pass
on
now
to
the
consideration
of
how
the
jewish
servants
were
protected
by
if
she
please
not
her
master
who
hath
betrothed
her
to
himself
then
shall
he
let
her
be
redeemed
to
sell
her
unto
another
nation
he
shall
have
no
power
seeing
he
hath
dealt
deceitfully
with
her
if
he
have
betrothed
her
unto
his
son
he
shall
deal
with
her
after
the
manner
of
daughters
if
he
take
him
another
wife
her
food
her
raiment
and
her
duty
of
marriage
shall
he
not
diminish
if
he
do
not
these
three
unto
her
then
shall
she
go
out
without
money
on
these
laws
i
will
give
you
calmet
remarks
a
father
could
not
sell
his
daughter
as
a
slave
according
to
the
rabbins
until
she
was
at
the
age
of
puberty
and
unless
he
were
reduced
to
the
utmost
indigence
besides
when
a
master
bought
an
israelitish
girl
it
was
with
the
presumption
that
he
would
take
her
to
wife
hence
moses
adds
she
please
not
her
master
and
he
does
not
think
fit
to
marry
her
he
shall
set
her
at
liberty
or
according
to
the
hebrew
shall
let
her
be
redeemed
sell
her
to
another
nation
he
shall
have
no
power
seeing
he
hath
dealt
deceitfully
with
her
as
to
the
engagement
implied
at
least
of
taking
her
to
wife
he
have
betrothed
her
unto
his
son
he
shall
deal
with
her
after
the
manner
of
daughters
he
shall
take
care
that
his
son
uses
her
as
his
wife
that
he
does
not
despise
or
maltreat
her
if
he
make
his
son
marry
another
wife
he
shall
give
her
her
dowry
her
clothes
and
compensation
for
her
virginity
if
he
does
none
of
these
three
she
shall
out
without
money
thus
were
the
of
female
servants
carefully
secured
by
under
the
jewish
dispensation
and
now
i
would
ask
are
the
rights
of
female
slaves
at
the
south
thus
secured
are
sold
only
as
wives
and
and
when
not
treated
as
such
are
they
allowed
to
out
free
no
they
have
not
only
been
illegally
obtained
as
servants
according
to
hebrew
law
but
they
are
also
illegally
in
bondage
masters
at
the
south
and
west
have
all
forfeited
their
claims
they
ever
had
any
to
their
female
slaves
we
come
now
to
examine
the
case
of
those
servants
who
were
of
the
heathen
round
about
were
left
entirely
unprotected
by
law
horne
in
speaking
of
the
law
thou
shalt
not
rule
over
him
with
rigor
but
shalt
fear
thy
god
remarks
this
law
lev
xxv
it
is
true
speaks
expressly
of
slaves
who
were
of
hebrew
descent
but
as
slaves
were
ingrafted
into
the
hebrew
church
by
circumcision
is
no
but
that
it
applied
to
slaves
if
so
then
we
may
reasonably
suppose
that
the
other
protective
laws
extended
to
them
also
and
that
the
only
difference
between
hebrew
and
heathen
servants
lay
in
this
that
the
former
served
but
six
years
unless
they
chose
to
remain
longer
and
were
always
freed
at
the
death
of
their
masters
whereas
the
latter
served
until
the
year
of
jubilee
though
that
might
include
a
period
of
years
and
were
left
from
father
to
son
there
are
however
two
other
laws
which
i
have
not
yet
noticed
the
one
effectually
prevented
servitude
and
the
other
completely
abolished
jewish
servitude
every
fifty
years
they
were
equally
operative
upon
the
heathen
and
the
hebrew
thou
shalt
deliver
unto
his
master
the
servant
that
is
escaped
from
his
master
unto
thee
he
shall
dwell
with
thee
even
among
you
in
that
place
which
he
shall
choose
in
one
of
thy
gates
where
it
liketh
him
best
thou
shalt
oppress
him
deut
xxiii
and
ye
shall
hallow
the
fiftieth
year
and
proclaim
throughout
the
land
unto
the
inhabitants
thereof
it
shall
be
a
jubilee
unto
you
lev
xxv
here
then
we
see
that
by
this
first
law
the
of
freedom
was
opened
wide
to
every
servant
had
any
cause
whatever
for
complaint
if
he
was
unhappy
with
his
master
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
leave
him
and
had
a
right
to
deliver
him
back
to
him
again
and
not
only
so
but
the
absconded
servant
was
to
where
he
should
live
and
no
jew
was
permitted
to
oppress
him
he
left
his
master
just
as
our
northern
servants
leave
us
we
have
no
power
to
compel
them
to
remain
with
us
and
no
man
has
any
right
to
oppress
them
they
go
and
dwell
in
that
place
where
it
chooseth
them
and
live
just
where
they
like
is
it
so
at
the
south
is
the
poor
runaway
slave
protected
from
the
violence
of
that
master
whose
oppression
and
cruelty
has
driven
him
from
his
plantation
or
his
house
no
no
even
the
free
states
of
the
north
are
compelled
to
deliver
unto
his
master
the
servant
that
is
escaped
from
his
master
into
them
by
law
under
the
in
the
century
are
commanded
to
do
what
more
than
years
ago
under
the
the
jews
to
do
in
the
wide
domain
even
of
our
free
states
there
is
not
city
of
refuge
for
the
poor
runaway
fugitive
not
one
spot
upon
which
he
can
stand
and
say
i
am
a
free
man
i
am
protected
in
my
rights
as
a
by
the
strong
arm
of
the
law
no
how
long
the
north
will
thus
shake
hands
with
the
south
in
sin
i
know
not
how
long
she
will
stand
by
like
the
persecutor
saul
unto
the
death
of
stephen
and
keeping
the
raiment
of
them
that
slew
him
i
know
not
but
one
thing
i
do
know
the
of
the
is
increasing
in
a
tremendous
ratio
as
light
is
pouring
in
upon
her
on
the
subject
and
the
sin
of
slavery
as
the
sun
of
righteousness
climbs
higher
and
higher
in
the
moral
heavens
she
will
stand
still
more
and
more
abashed
as
the
query
is
thundered
down
into
her
ear
hath
required
at
thy
hand
it
will
be
found
excuse
then
that
the
constitution
of
our
country
required
that
bound
to
escaping
from
their
masters
should
be
delivered
up
no
more
excuse
than
was
the
reason
which
adam
assigned
for
eating
the
forbidden
fruit
was
condemned
and
punished
he
hearkened
to
the
voice
of
rather
than
to
the
command
of
his
maker
and
shall
assuredly
be
condemned
and
punished
for
obeying
rather
than
if
we
do
not
speedily
repent
and
bring
forth
fruits
meet
for
repentance
yea
are
we
not
receiving
chastisement
even
but
by
the
second
of
these
laws
a
still
more
astonishing
fact
is
disclosed
if
the
first
effectually
prevented
involuntary
the
last
absolutely
forbade
even
servitude
being
on
the
great
day
of
atonement
every
fiftieth
year
the
jubilee
trumpet
was
sounded
throughout
the
land
of
judea
and
was
proclaimed
to
the
inhabitants
thereof
i
will
not
say
that
the
servants
fell
off
and
their
were
burst
for
there
is
no
evidence
that
jewish
servants
felt
the
weight
of
iron
chains
and
collars
and
handcuffs
but
i
do
say
that
even
the
man
who
had
voluntarily
sold
himself
and
the
who
had
been
sold
to
a
hebrew
master
were
set
free
the
one
as
well
as
the
other
this
law
was
evidently
designed
to
prevent
the
oppression
of
the
poor
and
the
possibility
of
such
a
thing
as
existing
among
them
where
then
i
would
ask
is
the
warrant
the
justification
or
the
palliation
of
american
slavery
from
hebrew
servitude
how
many
of
the
southern
slaves
would
now
be
in
bondage
according
to
the
laws
of
moses
not
one
you
may
observe
that
i
have
carefully
avoided
using
the
term
when
speaking
of
jewish
servitude
and
simply
for
this
reason
that
such
existed
among
that
people
the
word
translated
servant
does
mean
it
is
the
same
that
is
applied
to
abraham
to
moses
to
elisha
and
the
prophets
generally
then
existed
under
the
jewish
dispensation
at
all
and
i
can
not
but
regard
it
as
an
aspersion
on
the
character
of
him
who
is
glorious
in
holiness
for
any
one
to
assert
that
sanctioned
yea
commanded
under
the
old
dispensation
i
would
fain
lift
my
feeble
voice
to
vindicate
jehovah
character
from
so
foul
a
slander
if
slaveholders
are
determined
to
hold
slaves
as
long
as
they
can
let
them
not
dare
to
say
that
the
god
of
mercy
and
of
truth
sanctioned
such
a
system
of
cruelty
and
wrong
it
is
blasphemy
against
him
we
have
seen
that
the
code
of
laws
framed
by
moses
with
regard
to
servants
was
designed
to
as
and
to
secure
to
them
their
as
to
guard
them
from
oppression
and
defend
them
from
violence
of
every
kind
let
us
now
turn
to
the
slave
laws
of
the
south
and
west
and
examine
them
too
i
will
give
you
the
substance
only
because
i
fear
i
shall
trespass
too
much
on
your
time
were
i
to
quote
them
at
length
is
hereditary
and
perpetual
to
the
last
moment
of
the
slave
earthly
existence
and
to
all
his
descendants
to
the
latest
posterity
the
labor
of
the
slave
is
compulsory
and
uncompensated
while
the
kind
of
labor
the
amount
of
toil
the
time
allowed
for
rest
are
dictated
solely
by
the
master
no
bargain
is
made
no
wages
given
a
pure
despotism
governs
the
human
brute
and
even
his
covering
and
provender
both
as
to
quantity
and
quality
depend
entirely
on
the
master
discretion
a
footnote
a
there
are
laws
in
some
of
the
slave
states
limiting
the
labor
which
the
master
may
require
of
the
slave
to
fourteen
hours
daily
in
some
of
the
states
there
are
laws
requiring
the
masters
to
furnish
a
certain
amount
of
food
and
clothing
as
for
instance
of
corn
per
day
or
per
week
or
per
month
and
linen
shirt
and
pantaloons
for
the
summer
and
a
linen
shirt
and
woolen
great
coat
and
pantaloons
for
the
winter
but
still
to
use
the
language
of
judge
stroud
the
slave
is
entirely
under
the
control
of
his
is
unprovided
with
a
protector
and
especially
as
he
can
not
be
a
witness
or
make
complaint
in
any
known
mode
against
his
master
the
object
of
these
laws
may
be
defeated
ed
the
slave
being
considered
a
personal
chattel
may
be
sold
or
pledged
or
leased
at
the
will
of
his
master
he
may
be
exchanged
for
marketable
commodities
or
taken
in
execution
for
the
debts
or
taxes
either
of
a
living
or
dead
master
sold
at
auction
either
individually
or
in
lots
to
suit
the
purchaser
he
may
remain
with
his
family
or
be
separated
from
them
for
ever
slaves
can
make
no
contracts
and
have
no
right
to
any
property
real
or

i
ask
you
rather
to
mark
the
contrast
the
laws
of
moses
in
their
as
and
guarded
them
from
oppression
and
defended
them
from

the

all
his

him
to
a

defends
the
in
the
exercise
of
the
most
unnatural
and
unwarrantable

attributes

justice
and
mercy
are
shadowed
out
in
the
hebrew
code
those
of
injustice
and
cruelty
in
the
code
noir
of
america
truly
it
was
wise
in
the
slaveholders
of
the
south
to
declare
their
slaves
to
be
chattels
personal
for
before
they
could
be
robbed
of
wages
wives
children
and
friends
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
deny
they
were
human
beings
it
is
wise
in
them
to
keep
them
in
abject
ignorance
for
the
strong
man
armed
must
be
bound
before
we
can
spoil
his
house
the
powerful
intellect
of
man
must
be
bound
down
with
the
iron
chains
of
nescience
before
we
can
rob
him
of
his
rights
as
a
man
we
must
reduce
him
to
a
before
we
can
claim
the
right
to
set
our
feet
upon
his
neck
because
it
was
only
which
were
originally
under
the
feet
of
by
the
almighty
and
beneficent
father
of
all
who
has
declared
himself
to
be
of
persons
whether
red
white
or
black
but
some
have
even
said
that
jesus
christ
did
not
condemn
slavery
to
this
i
reply
that
our
holy
redeemer
lived
and
preached
among
the
jews
only
the
laws
which
moses
had
enacted
fifteen
hundred
years
previous
to
his
appearance
among
them
had
never
been
annulled
and
these
laws
protected
every
servant
in
palestine
if
then
he
did
not
condemn
jewish
servitude
this
does
not
prove
that
he
would
not
have
condemned
such
a
monstrous
system
as
that
of
american
if
that
had
existed
among
them
but
did
not
jesus
condemn
slavery
let
us
examine
some
of
his
precepts
ye
would
that
men
should
do
to
you
do
even
so
to
let
every
slaveholder
apply
these
queries
to
his
own
heart
am
willing
to
be
a
slave
am
willing
to
see
my
wife
the
slave
of
another
am
willing
to
see
my
mother
a
slave
or
my
father
my
sister
or
my
brother
if
not
then
in
holding
others
as
slaves
i
am
doing
what
i
would
wish
to
be
done
to
me
or
any
relative
i
have
and
thus
have
i
broken
this
golden
rule
which
was
given
to
walk
by
but
some
slaveholders
have
said
we
were
never
in
bondage
to
any
man
and
therefore
the
yoke
of
bondage
would
be
insufferable
to
us
but
slaves
are
accustomed
to
it
their
backs
are
fitted
to
the
burden
well
i
am
willing
to
admit
that
you
who
have
lived
in
freedom
would
find
slavery
even
more
oppressive
than
the
poor
slave
does
but
then
you
may
try
this
question
in
another
form
am
i
willing
to
reduce
little
to
slavery
you
know
that
it
is
brought
up
a
it
will
never
know
any
contrast
between
freedom
and
bondage
its
back
will
become
fitted
to
the
burden
just
as
the
negro
child
does
by
but
by
daily
violent
pressure
in
the
same
way
that
the
head
of
the
indian
child
becomes
flattened
by
the
boards
in
which
it
is
bound
it
has
been
justly
remarked
that
never
made
a
he
made
man
upright
his
back
was
made
to
carry
burdens
nor
his
neck
to
wear
a
yoke
and
the
must
be
crushed
within
him
before
back
can
be
to
the
burden
of
perpetual
slavery
and
that
his
back
is
fitted
to
it
is
manifest
by
the
insurrections
that
so
often
disturb
the
peace
and
security
of
slaveholding
countries
who
ever
heard
of
a
rebellion
of
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
why
not
simply
because
were
all
placed
the
feet
of
into
whose
hand
they
were
delivered
it
was
originally
designed
that
they
should
serve
him
therefore
their
necks
have
been
formed
for
the
yoke
and
their
backs
for
the
burden
but
so
with
intellectual
immortal
man
i
appeal
to
you
my
friends
as
mothers
are
you
willing
to
enslave
children
you
start
back
with
horror
and
indignation
at
such
a
question
but
why
if
slavery
is
to
those
upon
whom
it
is
imposed
why
if
as
has
often
been
said
slaves
are
happier
than
their
masters
free
from
the
cares
and
perplexities
of
providing
for
themselves
and
their
try
yourselves
by
another
of
the
divine
precepts
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbor
as
thyself
can
we
love
a
man
we
love
if
we
do
and
continue
to
unto
him
what
we
would
not
wish
any
one
to
do
to
us
look
too
at
christ
example
what
does
he
say
of
himself
i
came
to
be
ministered
unto
but
to
minister
can
you
for
a
moment
imagine
the
meek
and
lowly
and
compassionate
saviour
do
you
not
shudder
at
this
thought
as
much
as
at
that
of
his
being
but
why
if
slavery
is
not
sinful
again
it
has
been
said
the
apostle
paul
did
not
condemn
slavery
for
he
sent
onesimus
back
to
philemon
i
do
not
think
it
can
be
said
he
sent
him
back
for
no
coercion
was
made
use
of
onesimus
was
not
thrown
into
prison
and
then
sent
back
in
chains
to
his
master
as
your
runaway
slaves
often
are
this
could
not
possibly
have
been
the
case
because
you
know
paul
as
a
jew
was
to
the
runaway
had
no
to
send
fugitive
back
to
his
master
the
state
of
the
case
then
seems
to
have
been
this
onesimus
had
been
an
unprofitable
servant
to
philemon
and
left
him
he
afterwards
became
converted
under
the
apostle
preaching
and
seeing
that
he
had
been
to
blame
in
his
conduct
and
desiring
by
future
fidelity
to
atone
for
past
error
he
wished
to
return
and
the
apostle
gave
him
the
letter
we
now
have
as
a
recommendation
to
philemon
informing
him
of
the
conversion
of
onesimus
and
entreating
him
as
paul
the
aged
to
receive
him
now
as
a
but
a
servant
a
especially
to
me
but
how
much
more
unto
thee
both
in
the
flesh
and
in
the
lord
if
thou
count
therefore
as
a
partner
him
as
this
then
surely
can
not
be
forced
into
a
justification
of
the
practice
of
returning
runaway
slaves
back
to
their
masters
to
be
punished
with
cruel
beatings
and
scourgings
as
they
often
are
besides
the
word
here
translated
servant
is
the
same
that
is
made
use
of
in
matt
xviii
now
it
appears
that
this
servant
his
lord
ten
thousand
talents
he
possessed
property
to
a
vast
amount
and
what
is
still
more
surprising
if
he
was
a
is
that
forasmuch
as
he
had
not
to
pay
his
lord
commanded
to
be
sold
and
his
wife
and
children
and
all
that
he
had
and
payment
to
be
made
whoever
heard
of
a
slaveholder
selling
a
and
his
family
to
pay
himself
a
debt
due
to
him
from
a
what
would
he
gain
by
it
when
the
slave
is
himself
his
and
his
wife
and
children
also
onesimus
could
not
then
have
been
a
for
slaves
do
not
own
their
wives
or
children
no
not
even
their
own
bodies
much
less
property
but
again
the
servitude
which
the
apostle
was
accustomed
to
must
have
been
very
different
from
american
slavery
for
he
says
the
heir
or
son
as
long
as
he
is
a
child
differeth
from
a
though
he
be
lord
of
all
but
is
under
and
governors
until
the
time
appointed
of
the
father
from
this
it
appears
that
the
means
of
were
provided
for
as
well
as
children
and
indeed
we
know
it
must
have
been
so
among
the
jews
because
their
servants
were
not
permitted
to
remain
in
perpetual
bondage
and
therefore
it
was
absolutely
necessary
they
should
be
prepared
to
occupy
higher
stations
in
society
than
those
of
servants
is
it
so
at
the
south
my
friends
is
the
daily
bread
of
instruction
provided
for
are
their
minds
enlightened
and
they
gradually
prepared
to
rise
from
the
grade
of
menials
into
that
of
independent
members
of
the
state
let
your
own
statute
book
and
your
own
daily
experience
answer
these
questions
if
this
apostle
sanctioned
why
did
he
exhort
masters
thus
in
his
epistle
to
the
ephesians
and
ye
masters
do
the
same
things
unto
them
perform
your
duties
to
your
servants
as
unto
christ
not
unto
men
knowing
that
your
master
also
is
in
heaven
neither
is
respect
of
persons
with
and
in
colossians
masters
give
unto
your
servants
that
which
is
and
knowing
that
ye
also
have
a
master
in
heaven
let
slaveholders
only
these
injunctions
of
paul
and
i
am
satisfied
slavery
would
soon
be
abolished
if
he
thought
it
sinful
even
to
servants
surely
he
must
have
thought
it
sinful
to
flog
and
to
beat
them
with
sticks
and
paddles
indeed
when
delineating
the
character
of
a
bishop
he
expressly
names
this
as
one
feature
of
it
let
masters
give
unto
their
servants
that
which
is
and
and
all
that
vast
system
of
unrequited
labor
would
crumble
into
ruin
yes
and
if
they
once
felt
they
had
no
right
to
the
of
their
servants
without
pay
surely
they
could
not
think
they
had
a
right
to
their
wives
their
children
and
their
own
bodies
again
how
can
it
be
said
paul
sanctioned
slavery
when
as
though
to
put
this
matter
beyond
all
doubt
in
that
black
catalogue
of
sins
enumerated
in
his
first
epistle
to
timothy
he
mentions
which
word
may
be
translated
but
you
may
say
we
all
despise
slavedealers
as
much
as
any
one
can
they
are
never
admitted
into
genteel
or
respectable
society
and
why
not
is
it
not
because
even
you
shrink
back
from
the
idea
of
associating
with
those
who
make
their
fortunes
by
trading
in
the
bodies
and
souls
of
men
women
and
children
whose
daily
work
it
is
to
break
human
hearts
by
tearing
wives
from
their
husbands
and
children
from
their
parents
but
why
hold
slavedealers
as
despicable
if
their
trade
is
lawful
and
virtuous
and
why
despise
them
more
than
the
of
fortune
and
who
employ
them
as
agents
why
more
than
the
of
who
barter
their
to
them
for
gold
and
silver
we
do
not
despise
the
land
agent
or
the
physician
or
the
merchant
and
why
simply
because
their
processions
are
virtuous
and
honorable
and
if
the
trade
of
was
honorable
you
would
not
despise
them
either
there
is
no
difference
in
in
between
the
despised
slavedealer
and
the
who
buys
slaves
from
or
sells
slaves
to
him
indeed
if
slaves
were
not
wanted
by
the
respectable
the
wealthy
and
the
religious
in
a
community
there
would
be
no
slaves
in
that
community
and
of
course
no
it
is
then
the
and
the
and
of
the
south
who
are
the
of
this
grand
temple
built
to
mammon
and
to
moloch
it
is
the
in
every
country
who
are
to
blame
when
any
public
sin
is
supported
by
public
opinion
hence
isaiah
says
the
lord
hath
performed
his
whole
work
upon
mount
and
on
then
i
will
punish
the
fruit
of
the
stout
heart
of
the
king
of
assyria
and
the
glory
of
his
high
looks
and
was
it
not
so
open
the
historical
records
of
that
age
was
not
israel
carried
into
captivity
judah
and
the
stout
heart
of
the
heathen
monarchy
not
punished
until
years
judah
and
years
israel
captivity
when
it
was
overthrown
by
cyrus
king
of
persia
hence
too
the
apostle
peter
says
judgment
must
at
the
house
of
surely
this
would
not
be
the
case
if
the
of
were
not
of
blame
but
it
may
be
asked
why
are
most
culpable
i
will
tell
you
my
friends
it
is
because
sin
is
imputed
to
us
just
in
proportion
to
the
spiritual
light
we
receive
thus
the
prophet
amos
says
in
the
name
of
jehovah
have
i
known
of
all
the
families
of
the
earth
i
will
punish
for
all
your
iniquities
hear
too
the
doctrine
of
our
lord
on
this
important
subject
the
servant
who
his
lord
will
and
himself
neither
did
according
to
his
will
shall
be
beaten
with
and
why
for
unto
whomsoever
is
given
shall
be
required
and
to
whom
men
have
committed
of
they
will
ask
the
oh
then
that
the
of
the
south
would
ponder
these
things
in
their
hearts
and
awake
to
the
vast
responsibilities
which
rest
at
this
important
crisis
i
have
thus
i
think
clearly
proved
to
you
seven
propositions
viz
first
that
slavery
is
contrary
to
the
declaration
of
our
independence
second
that
it
is
contrary
to
the
first
charter
of
human
rights
given
to
adam
and
renewed
to
noah
third
that
the
fact
of
slavery
having
been
the
subject
of
prophecy
furnishes
excuse
whatever
to
slaveholders
fourth
that
no
such
system
existed
under
the
patriarchal
dispensation
fifth
that
existed
under
the
jewish
dispensation
but
so
far
otherwise
that
every
servant
was
placed
under
the
of
and
care
taken
not
only
to
prevent
all
servitude
but
all
bondage
sixth
that
slavery
in
america
reduces
a
to
a
a
chattel
personal
of
his
rights
as
a
fetters
both
his
mind
and
body
and
protects
the
in
the
most
unnatural
and
unreasonable
power
whilst
it
him
of
the
protection
of
law
seventh
that
slavery
is
contrary
to
the
example
and
precepts
of
our
holy
and
merciful
redeemer
and
of
his
apostles
but
perhaps
you
will
be
ready
to
query
why
appeal
to
on
this
subject
do
not
make
the
laws
which
perpetuate
slavery
legislative
power
is
vested
in
can
do
nothing
to
overthrow
the
system
even
if
we
wished
to
do
so
to
this
i
reply
i
know
you
do
not
make
the
laws
but
i
also
know
that
are
the
wives
and
mothers
the
sisters
and
daughters
of
those
who
and
if
you
really
suppose
can
do
nothing
to
overthrow
slavery
you
are
greatly
mistaken
you
can
do
much
in
every
way
four
things
i
will
name
you
can
read
on
this
subject
you
can
pray
over
this
subject
you
can
speak
on
this
subject
you
can
act
on
this
subject
i
have
not
placed
reading
before
praying
because
i
regard
it
more
important
but
because
in
order
to
pray
right
we
must
understand
what
we
are
praying
for
it
is
only
then
we
can
pray
with
the
understanding
and
the
spirit
also
read
then
on
the
subject
of
slavery
search
the
scriptures
daily
whether
the
things
i
have
told
you
are
true
other
books
and
papers
might
be
a
great
help
to
you
in
this
investigation
but
they
are
not
necessary
and
it
is
hardly
probable
that
your
committees
of
vigilance
will
allow
you
to
have
any
other
the
then
is
the
book
i
want
you
to
read
in
the
spirit
of
inquiry
and
the
spirit
of
prayer
even
the
enemies
of
abolitionists
acknowledge
that
their
doctrines
are
drawn
from
it
in
the
great
mob
in
boston
last
autumn
when
the
books
and
papers
of
the
society
were
thrown
out
of
the
windows
of
their
office
one
individual
laid
hold
of
the
bible
and
was
about
tossing
it
out
to
the
crowd
when
another
reminded
him
that
it
was
the
bible
he
had
in
his
hand
oh
is
all
one
he
replied
and
out
went
the
sacred
volume
along
with
the
rest
we
thank
him
for
the
acknowledgment
it
is
all
one
for
our
books
and
papers
are
mostly
commentaries
on
the
bible
and
the
declaration
read
the
then
it
contains
the
words
of
jesus
and
they
are
spirit
and
life
judge
for
yourselves
whether
such
a
system
of
oppression
and
crime
pray
over
this
subject
when
you
have
entered
into
your
closets
and
shut
to
the
doors
then
pray
to
your
father
who
seeth
in
secret
that
he
would
open
your
eyes
to
see
whether
slavery
is
and
if
it
is
that
he
would
enable
you
to
bear
a
faithful
open
and
unshrinking
testimony
against
it
and
to
do
whatsoever
your
hands
find
to
do
leaving
the
consequences
entirely
to
him
who
still
says
to
us
whenever
we
try
to
reason
away
duty
from
the
fear
of
consequences
what
is
that
to
thee
follow
thou
me
pray
also
for
the
poor
slave
that
he
may
be
kept
patient
and
submissive
under
his
hard
lot
until
god
is
pleased
to
open
the
door
of
freedom
to
him
without
violence
or
bloodshed
pray
too
for
the
master
that
his
heart
may
be
softened
and
he
made
willing
to
acknowledge
as
joseph
brethren
did
verily
we
are
guilty
concerning
our
brother
before
he
will
be
compelled
to
add
in
consequence
of
divine
judgment
therefore
is
all
this
evil
come
upon
us
pray
also
for
all
your
brethren
and
sisters
who
are
laboring
in
the
righteous
cause
of
emancipation
in
the
northern
states
england
and
the
world
there
is
great
encouragement
for
prayer
in
these
words
of
our
lord
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
the
father
in
any
name
he
will
give
it
to
you
pray
then
without
ceasing
in
the
closet
and
the
social
circle
speak
on
this
subject
it
is
through
the
tongue
the
pen
and
the
press
that
truth
is
principally
propagated
speak
then
to
your
relatives
your
friends
your
acquaintances
on
the
subject
of
slavery
be
not
afraid
if
you
are
conscientiously
convinced
it
is
to
say
so
openly
but
calmly
and
to
let
your
sentiments
be
known
if
you
are
served
by
the
slaves
of
others
try
to
ameliorate
their
condition
as
much
as
possible
never
aggravate
their
faults
and
thus
add
fuel
to
the
fire
of
anger
already
kindled
in
a
master
and
mistress
bosom
remember
their
extreme
ignorance
and
consider
them
as
your
heavenly
father
does
the
culpable
on
this
account
even
when
they
do
wrong
things
discountenance
cruelty
to
them
all
starvation
all
corporal
chastisement
these
may
brutalize
and
their
spirits
but
will
never
bend
them
to
willing
cheerful
obedience
if
possible
see
that
they
are
comfortably
and
fed
whether
in
the
house
or
the
field
it
is
unreasonable
and
cruel
to
expect
slaves
to
wait
for
their
breakfast
until
eleven
when
they
rise
at
five
or
six
do
all
you
can
to
induce
their
owners
to
clothe
them
well
and
to
allow
them
many
little
indulgences
which
would
contribute
to
their
comfort
above
all
try
to
persuade
your
husband
father
brothers
and
sons
that
is
a
crime
against
god
and
and
that
it
is
a
great
sin
to
keep
in
such
abject
ignorance
to
deny
them
the
privilege
of
learning
to
read
and
write
the
catholics
are
universally
condemned
for
denying
the
bible
to
the
common
people
but
must
blame
them
for
are
doing
the
same
and
for
the
very
same
reason
neither
of
these
systems
can
bear
the
light
which
bursts
from
the
pages
of
that
holy
book
and
lastly
endeavour
to
inculcate
submission
on
the
part
of
the
slaves
but
whilst
doing
this
be
faithful
in
pleading
the
cause
of
the
oppressed
will
behold
unheeding
life
holiest
feelings
crushed
where
heart
is
bleeding
shall
voice
be
hushed
act
on
this
subject
some
of
you
slaves
yourselves
if
you
believe
slavery
is
set
them
at
liberty
undo
the
heavy
burdens
and
let
the
oppressed
go
free
if
they
wish
to
remain
with
you
pay
them
wages
if
not
let
them
leave
you
should
they
remain
teach
them
and
have
them
taught
the
common
branches
of
an
english
education
they
have
minds
and
those
minds
to
be
so
precious
a
talent
as
intellect
never
was
given
to
be
wrapt
in
a
napkin
and
buried
in
the
earth
it
is
the
of
all
as
far
as
they
can
to
improve
their
own
mental
faculties
because
we
are
commanded
to
love
god
with
our
as
well
as
with
all
our
hearts
and
we
commit
a
great
sin
if
we
or
that
cultivation
of
the
mind
in
others
which
would
enable
them
to
perform
this
duty
teach
your
servants
then
to
read
and
encourage
them
to
believe
it
is
their
to
learn
if
it
were
only
that
they
might
read
the
bible
but
some
of
you
will
say
we
can
neither
free
our
slaves
nor
teach
them
to
read
for
the
laws
of
our
state
forbid
it
be
not
surprised
when
i
say
such
wicked
laws
to
be
no
in
the
way
of
your
duty
and
i
appeal
to
the
bible
to
prove
this
position
what
was
the
conduct
of
shiprah
and
puah
when
the
king
of
egypt
issued
his
cruel
mandate
with
regard
to
the
hebrew
children
feared
and
did
as
the
king
of
egypt
commanded
them
but
saved
the
men
children
alive
and
be
it
remembered
that
it
was
through
faithfulness
that
moses
was
preserved
this
great
and
immediate
emancipator
was
indebted
to
a
for
his
spared
life
and
he
became
a
blessing
to
the
whole
jewish
nation
did
these
do
right
in
disobeying
that
monarch
says
the
sacred
text
dealt
with
them
and
made
them
houses
ex
i
what
was
the
conduct
of
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
when
nebuchadnezzar
set
up
a
golden
image
in
the
plain
of
dura
and
commanded
all
people
nations
and
languages
to
fall
down
and
worship
it
be
it
known
unto
thee
said
these
faithful
o
king
that
will
serve
thy
gods
nor
worship
the
image
which
thou
hast
set
up
did
these
men
right
in
disobeying
the
of
their
sovereign
let
their
miraculous
deliverance
from
the
burning
fiery
furnace
answer
dan
iii
what
was
the
conduct
of
daniel
when
darius
made
a
firm
decree
that
no
one
should
ask
a
petition
of
any
man
or
god
for
thirty
days
did
the
prophet
cease
to
pray
no
when
daniel
that
the
writing
was
he
went
into
his
house
and
his
windows
being
towards
jerusalem
he
kneeled
upon
his
knees
three
times
a
day
and
prayed
and
gave
thanks
before
his
god
as
he
did
aforetime
did
daniel
do
right
thus
to
the
law
of
his
king
let
his
wonderful
deliverance
out
of
the
mouths
of
the
lions
answer
dan
vii
look
too
at
the
apostles
peter
and
john
when
the
rulers
of
the
jews
them
to
speak
at
all
nor
teach
in
the
name
of
jesus
what
did
they
say
whether
it
be
right
in
the
sight
of
god
to
hearken
unto
you
more
than
unto
god
judge
ye
and
what
did
they
do
they
spake
the
word
of
god
with
boldness
and
with
great
power
gave
the
apostles
witness
of
the
of
the
lord
jesus
although
was
the
very
doctrine
for
the
preaching
of
which
they
had
just
been
cast
into
prison
and
further
threatened
did
these
men
do
right
i
leave
to
answer
who
now
enjoy
the
benefits
of
their
labors
and
sufferings
in
that
gospel
they
dared
to
preach
when
positively
commanded
to
teach
any
in
the
name
of
jesus
acts
iv
but
some
of
you
may
say
if
we
do
free
our
slaves
they
will
be
taken
up
and
sold
therefore
there
will
be
no
use
in
doing
it
peter
and
john
might
just
as
well
have
said
we
will
not
preach
the
gospel
for
if
we
do
we
shall
be
taken
up
and
put
in
prison
therefore
there
will
be
no
use
in
our
preaching
my
friends
belong
no
more
to
than
they
did
to
these
apostles
duty
is
ours
and
events
are
god
if
you
think
slavery
is
sinful
all
have
to
do
is
to
set
your
slaves
at
liberty
do
all
you
can
to
protect
them
and
in
humble
faith
and
fervent
prayer
commend
them
to
your
common
father
he
can
take
care
of
them
but
if
for
wise
purposes
he
sees
fit
to
allow
them
to
be
sold
this
will
afford
you
an
opportunity
of
testifying
openly
wherever
you
go
against
the
crime
of
such
an
act
will
be
and
if
exposed
might
under
the
divine
direction
do
the
cause
of
emancipation
more
good
than
any
thing
that
could
happen
for
he
makes
even
the
wrath
of
man
to
praise
him
and
the
remainder
of
wrath
he
will
restrain
i
know
that
this
doctrine
of
obeying
rather
than
man
will
be
considered
as
dangerous
and
heretical
by
many
but
i
am
not
afraid
openly
to
avow
it
because
it
is
the
doctrine
of
the
bible
but
i
would
not
be
understood
to
advocate
resistance
to
any
law
however
oppressive
if
in
obeying
it
i
was
not
obliged
to
commit
if
for
instance
there
was
a
law
which
imposed
imprisonment
or
a
fine
upon
me
if
i
manumitted
a
slave
i
would
on
no
account
resist
that
law
i
would
set
the
slave
free
and
then
go
to
prison
or
suffer
the
penalty
if
a
law
commands
me
to
i
will
break
if
it
calls
me
to
i
will
let
it
take
its
course
the
doctrine
of
blind
obedience
and
unqualified
submission
to
power
whether
civil
or
ecclesiastical
is
the
doctrine
of
despotism
and
ought
to
have
no
place
among
republicans
and
christians
but
you
will
perhaps
say
such
a
course
of
conduct
would
inevitably
expose
us
to
great
suffering
yes
my
christian
friends
i
believe
it
would
but
this
will
excuse
you
or
any
one
else
for
the
neglect
of
if
prophets
and
apostles
martyrs
and
reformers
had
not
been
willing
to
suffer
for
the
truth
sake
where
would
the
world
have
been
now
if
they
had
said
we
can
not
speak
the
truth
we
can
not
do
what
we
believe
is
right
because
the
of
our
country
or
public
opinion
are
against
where
would
our
holy
religion
have
been
now
the
prophets
were
stoned
imprisoned
and
killed
by
the
jews
and
why
because
they
exposed
and
openly
rebuked
public
sins
they
opposed
public
opinion
had
they
held
their
peace
they
all
might
have
lived
in
ease
and
died
in
favor
with
a
wicked
generation
why
were
the
apostles
persecuted
from
city
to
city
stoned
incarcerated
beaten
and
crucified
because
they
dared
to
the
to
tell
the
jews
boldly
and
fearlessly
that
were
the
of
the
lord
of
glory
and
that
however
great
a
the
cross
might
be
to
them
there
was
no
other
name
given
under
heaven
by
which
men
could
be
saved
but
the
name
of
jesus
because
they
declared
even
at
athens
the
seat
of
learning
and
refinement
the
truth
that
they
be
no
gods
that
are
made
with
men
hands
and
exposed
to
the
grecians
the
foolishness
of
worldly
wisdom
and
the
impossibility
of
salvation
but
through
christ
whom
they
despised
on
account
of
the
ignominious
death
he
died
because
at
rome
the
proud
mistress
of
the
world
they
thundered
out
the
terrors
of
the
law
upon
that
idolatrous
and
community
why
were
the
martyrs
stretched
upon
the
rack
gibbetted
and
burnt
the
scorn
and
diversion
of
a
nero
whilst
their
tarred
and
burning
bodies
sent
up
a
light
which
illuminated
the
roman
capital
why
were
the
waldenses
hunted
like
wild
beasts
upon
the
mountains
of
piedmont
and
slain
with
the
sword
of
the
duke
of
savoy
and
the
proud
monarch
of
france
why
were
the
presbyterians
chased
like
the
partridge
over
the
highlands
of
scotland
the
methodists
pumped
and
stoned
and
pelted
with
rotten
eggs
the
quakers
incarcerated
in
filthy
prisons
beaten
whipped
at
the
cart
tail
banished
and
hung
because
they
dared
to
the
to
the
unrighteous
of
their
country
and
chose
rather
to
suffer
affliction
with
the
people
of
god
not
accepting
deliverance
even
under
the
gallows
why
were
luther
and
calvin
persecuted
and
excommunicated
cranmer
ridley
and
latimer
burnt
because
they
fearlessly
proclaimed
the
truth
though
that
truth
was
contrary
to
public
opinion
and
the
authority
of
ecclesiastical
councils
and
conventions
now
all
this
vast
amount
of
human
suffering
might
have
been
saved
all
these
prophets
and
apostles
martyrs
and
reformers
might
have
lived
and
died
in
peace
with
all
men
but
following
the
example
of
their
great
pattern
they
despised
the
shame
endured
the
cross
and
are
now
set
down
on
the
right
hand
of
the
throne
of
god
having
received
the
glorious
welcome
of
well
good
and
faithful
servants
enter
ye
into
the
joy
of
your
lord
but
you
may
say
we
are
how
can
hearts
endure
persecution
and
why
not
have
not
arisen
in
all
the
dignity
and
strength
of
moral
courage
to
be
the
leaders
of
the
people
and
to
bear
a
faithful
testimony
for
the
truth
whenever
the
providence
of
god
has
called
them
to
do
so
are
there
no
in
that
noble
army
of
martyrs
who
are
now
singing
the
song
of
moses
and
the
lamb
who
led
out
the
women
of
israel
from
the
house
of
bondage
striking
the
timbrel
and
singing
the
song
of
deliverance
on
the
banks
of
that
sea
whose
waters
stood
up
like
walls
of
crystal
to
open
a
passage
for
their
escape
it
was
a
miriam
the
prophetess
the
sister
of
moses
and
aaron
who
went
up
with
barak
to
kadesh
to
fight
against
jabin
king
of
canaan
into
whose
hand
israel
had
been
sold
because
of
their
iniquities
it
was
a
deborah
the
wife
of
lapidoth
the
judge
as
well
as
the
prophetess
of
that
backsliding
people
judges
iv
into
whose
hands
was
sisera
the
captain
of
jabin
host
delivered
into
the
hand
of
a
jael
the
wife
of
heber
judges
vi
who
dared
to
the
concerning
those
judgments
which
were
coming
upon
judea
when
josiah
alarmed
at
finding
that
his
people
had
not
kept
the
word
of
the
lord
to
do
after
all
that
was
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
sent
to
enquire
of
the
lord
concerning
these
things
it
was
a
huldah
the
prophetess
the
wife
of
shallum
chron
xxxiv
who
was
chosen
to
deliver
the
whole
jewish
nation
from
that
murderous
decree
of
persia
king
which
wicked
haman
had
obtained
by
calumny
and
fraud
it
was
a
esther
the
queen
yes
weak
and
trembling
was
the
instrument
appointed
by
god
to
reverse
the
bloody
mandate
of
the
eastern
monarch
and
save
the
visible
from
destruction
what
human
voice
first
proclaimed
to
mary
that
she
should

of
our
lord
it
was
a
elizabeth
the
wife
of
zacharias
luke
i
who
united
with
the
good
old
simeon
in
giving
thanks
publicly
in
the
temple
when
the
child
jesus
was
presented
there
by
his
parents
and
spake
of
him
to
all
them
that
looked
for
redemption
in
jerusalem
it
was
a
anna
the
prophetess
who
first
proclaimed
christ
as
the
true
messiah
in
the
streets
of
samaria
once
the
capital
of
the
ten
tribes
it
was
a
who
ministered
to
the
son
of
god
whilst
on
earth
a
despised
and
persecuted
reformer
in
the
humble
garb
of
a
carpenter
they
were
who
followed
the
rejected
king
of
israel
as
his
fainting
footsteps
trod
the
road
to
calvary
a
great
company
of
people
and
of
and
it
is
remarkable
that
to
he
turned
and
addressed
the
pathetic
language
daughters
of
jerusalem
weep
not
for
me
but
weep
for
yourselves
and
your
children
ah
who
sent
unto
the
roman
governor
when
he
was
set
down
on
the
judgment
seat
saying
unto
him
have
thou
nothing
to
do
with
that
just
man
for
i
have
suffered
many
things
this
day
in
a
dream
because
of
him
it
was
a
the
wife
of
pilate
although
that
for
envy
the
jews
had
delivered
christ
yet
consented
to
surrender
the
son
of
god
into
the
hands
of
a
brutal
soldiery
after
having
himself
scourged
his
naked
body
had
the
of
pilate
sat
upon
that
judgment
seat
what
would
have
been
the
result
of
the
trial
of
this
just
person
and
who
last
hung
round
the
cross
of
jesus
on
the
mountain
of
golgotha
who
first
visited
the
sepulchre
early
in
the
morning
on
the
first
day
of
the
week
carrying
sweet
spices
to
embalm
his
precious
body
not
knowing
that
it
was
incorruptible
and
could
not
be
holden
by
the
bands
of
death
these
were
to
whom
did
he
appear
after
his
resurrection
it
was
to
a
mary
magdalene
mark
xvi
who
gathered
with
the
apostles
to
wait
at
jerusalem
in
prayer
and
supplication
for
the
promise
of
the
father
the
spiritual
blessing
of
the
great
high
priest
of
his
church
who
had
entered
into
the
splendid
temple
of
solomon
there
to
offer
the
blood
of
bulls
and
of
goats
and
the
smoking
censer
upon
the
golden
altar
but
into
heaven
itself
there
to
present
his
intercessions
after
having
given
himself
for
us
an
offering
and
a
sacrifice
to
god
for
a
sweet
smelling
savor
were
among
that
holy
company
acts
i
and
did
wait
in
vain
did
those
who
had
ministered
to
his
necessities
followed
in
his
train
and
wept
at
his
crucifixion
wait
in
vain
no
no
did
the
cloven
tongues
of
fire
descend
upon
the
heads
of
as
well
as
men
yes
my
friends
it
sat
upon
one
of
acts
ii
as
well
as
men
were
to
be
living
stones
in
the
temple
of
grace
and
therefore
heads
were
consecrated
by
the
descent
of
the
holy
ghost
as
well
as
those
of
men
were
recognized
as
fellow
laborers
in
the
gospel
field
they
were
paul
says
in
his
epistle
to
the
philippians
help
those
who
labored
with
me
in
the
gospel
phil
iv
but
this
is
not
all
roman
were
burnt
at
the
stake
delicate
limbs
were
torn
joint
from
joint
by
the
ferocious
beasts
of
the
ampitheatre
and
tossed
by
the
wild
bull
in
his
fury
for
the
diversion
of
that
idolatrous
warlike
and
slaveholding
people
yes
suffered
under
the
ten
persecutions
of
heathen
rome
with
the
most
unshrinking
constancy
and
fortitude
not
all
the
entreaties
of
friends
nor
the
claims
of
new
born
infancy
nor
the
cruel
threats
of
enemies
could
make
sprinkle
one
grain
of
incense
upon
the
altars
of
roman
idols
come
now
with
me
to
the
beautiful
valleys
of
piedmont
whose
blood
stains
the
green
sward
and
decks
the
wild
flowers
with
colors
not
their
own
and
smokes
on
the
sword
of
persecuting
france
it
is
as
well
as
man
yes
were
accounted
as
sheep
for
the
slaughter
and
were
cut
down
as
the
tender
saplings
of
the
wood
but
time
would
fail
me
to
tell
of
all
those
hundreds
and
thousands
of
who
perished
in
the
low
countries
of
holland
when
alva
sword
of
vengeance
was
unsheathed
against
the
protestants
when
the
catholic
inquisitions
of
europe
became
the
merciless
executioners
of
vindictive
wrath
upon
those
who
dared
to
worship
god
instead
of
bowing
down
in
unholy
adoration
before
my
lord
god
the
and
when
england
too
burnt
her
ann
ascoes
at
the
stake
of
martyrdom
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
church
after
having
been
driven
from
judea
to
rome
and
from
rome
to
piedmont
and
from
piedmont
to
england
and
from
england
to
holland
at
last
stretched
her
fainting
wings
over
the
dark
bosom
of
the
atlantic
and
found
on
the
shores
of
a
great
wilderness
a
refuge
from
tyranny
and
oppression
as
she
thought
but
the
warm
blush
of
shame
mantles
my
cheek
as
i
write
it
here
was
beaten
and
banished
imprisoned
and
hung
upon
the
gallows
a
trophy
to
the
cross
and
what
i
would
ask
in
conclusion
have
done
for
the
great
and
glorious
cause
of
emancipation
who
wrote
that
pamphlet
which
moved
the
heart
of
wilberforce
to
pray
over
the
wrongs
and
his
tongue
to
plead
the
cause
of
the
oppressed
african
it
was
a
elizabeth
heyrick
who
labored
assiduously
to
keep
the
sufferings
of
the
slave
continually
before
the
british
public
they
were
and
how
did
they
do
it
by
their
needles
paint
brushes
and
pens
by
speaking
the
truth
and
petitioning
parliament
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
and
what
was
the
effect
of
their
labors
read
it
in
the
emancipation
bill
of
great
britain
read
it
in
the
present
state
of
her
west
india
colonies
read
it
in
the
impulse
which
has
been
given
to
the
cause
of
freedom
in
the
united
states
of
america
have
english
women
then
done
so
much
for
the
negro
and
shall
american
women
do
nothing
oh
no
already
are
there
sixty
female
societies
in
operation
these
are
doing
just
what
the
english
women
did
telling
the
story
of
the
colored
wrongs
praying
for
his
deliverance
and
presenting
his
kneeling
image
constantly
before
the
public
eye
on
bags
and
even
the
children
of
the
north
are
inscribing
on
their
handy
work
may
the
points
of
our
needles
prick
the
slaveholder
conscience
some
of
the
reports
of
these
societies
exhibit
not
only
considerable
talent
but
a
deep
sense
of
religious
duty
and
a
determination
to
persevere
through
evil
as
well
as
good
report
until
every
scourge
and
every
shackle
is
buried
under
the
feet
of
the
manumitted
slave
the
ladies
society
of
boston
was
called
last
fall
to
a
severe
trial
of
their
faith
and
constancy
they
were
mobbed
by
the
gentlemen
of
property
and
standing
in
that
city
at
their
anniversary
meeting
and
their
lives
were
jeoparded
by
an
infuriated
crowd
but
their
conduct
on
that
occasion
did
credit
to
our
sex
and
affords
a
full
assurance
that
they
will
abandon
the
cause
of
the
slave
the
pamphlet
right
and
wrong
in
boston
issued
by
them
in
which
a
particular
account
is
given
of
that
mob
of
broad
cloth
in
broad
day
does
equal
credit
to
the
head
and
the
heart
of
her
who
wrote
it
i
wish
my
southern
sisters
could
read
it
they
would
then
understand
that
the
women
of
the
north
have
engaged
in
this
work
from
a
sense
of
and
that
nothing
will
ever
induce
them
to
take
their
hands
from
it
until
it
is
fully
accomplished
they
feel
no
hostility
to
you
no
bitterness
or
wrath
they
rather
sympathize
in
your
trials
and
difficulties
but
they
well
know
that
the
first
thing
to
be
done
to
help
you
is
to
pour
in
the
light
of
truth
on
your
minds
to
urge
you
to
reflect
on
and
pray
over
the
subject
this
is
all
can
do
for
you
must
work
out
your
own
deliverance
with
fear
and
trembling
and
with
the
direction
and
blessing
of
god
can
do
northern
women
may
labor
to
produce
a
correct
public
opinion
at
the
north
but
if
southern
women
sit
down
in
listless
indifference
and
criminal
idleness
public
opinion
can
not
be
rectified
and
purified
at
the
south
it
is
manifest
to
every
reflecting
mind
that
slavery
must
be
abolished
the
era
in
which
we
live
and
the
light
which
is
overspreading
the
whole
world
on
this
subject
clearly
show
that
the
time
can
not
be
distant
when
it
will
be
done
now
there
are
only
two
ways
in
which
it
can
be
effected
by
moral
power
or
physical
force
and
it
is
for
to
choose
which
of
these
you
prefer
slavery
always
has
and
always
will
produce
insurrections
wherever
it
exists
because
it
is
a
violation
of
the
natural
order
of
things
and
no
human
power
can
much
longer
perpetuate
it
the
opposers
of
abolitionists
fully
believe
this
one
of
them
remarked
to
me
not
long
since
there
is
no
doubt
there
will
be
a
most
terrible
overturning
at
the
south
in
a
few
years
such
cruelty
and
wrong
must
be
visited
with
divine
vengeance
soon
abolitionists
believe
too
that
this
must
inevitably
be
the
case
if
you
do
not
repent
and
they
are
not
willing
to
leave
you
to
perish
without
entreating
you
to
save
yourselves
from
destruction
well
may
they
say
with
the
apostle
am
i
then
your
enemy
because
i
tell
you
the
truth
and
warn
you
to
flee
from
impending
judgments
but
why
my
dear
friends
have
i
thus
been
endeavoring
to
lead
you
through
the
history
of
more
than
three
thousand
years
and
to
point
you
to
that
great
cloud
of
witnesses
who
have
gone
before
from
works
to
rewards
have
i
been
seeking
to
magnify
the
sufferings
and
exalt
the
character
of
woman
that
she
might
have
praise
of
men
no
no
my
object
has
been
to
arouse
as
the
wives
and
mothers
the
daughters
and
sisters
of
the
south
to
a
sense
of
your
duty
as
and
as
christian
women
on
that
great
subject
which
has
already
shaken
our
country
from
the
lawrence
and
the
lakes
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
from
the
mississippi
to
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
will
continue
mightily
to
shake
until
the
polluted
temple
of
slavery
fall
and
crumble
into
ruin
i
would
say
unto
each
one
of
you
what
meanest
thou
o
sleeper
arise
and
call
upon
thy
god
if
so
be
that
god
will
think
upon
us
that
we
perish
not
perceive
you
not
that
dark
cloud
of
vengeance
which
hangs
over
our
boasting
republic
saw
you
not
the
lightnings
of
heaven
wrath
in
the
flame
which
leaped
from
the
indian
torch
to
the
roof
of
yonder
dwelling
and
lighted
with
its
horrid
glare
the
darkness
of
midnight
heard
you
not
the
thunders
of
divine
anger
as
the
distant
roar
of
the
cannon
came
rolling
onward
from
the
texian
country
where
protestant
american
rebels
are
fighting
with
mexican
republicans
for
what
for
the
of
yes
of
american
slavery
in
the
bosom
of
a
catholic
republic
where
that
system
of
robbery
violence
and
wrong
had
been
legally
abolished
for
twelve
years
yes
citizens
of
the
united
states
after
plundering
mexico
of
her
land
are
now
engaged
in
deadly
conflict
for
the
privilege
of
fastening
chains
and
collars
and
manacles
upon
whom
upon
the
subjects
of
some
foreign
prince
no
upon
native
born
american
republican
citizens
although
the
fathers
of
these
very
men
declared
to
the
whole
world
while
struggling
to
free
themselves
from
the
three
penny
taxes
of
an
english
king
that
they
believed
it
to
be
a
truth
that
were
created
equal
and
had
an
right
to
well
may
the
poet
exclaim
in
bitter
sarcasm
the
fustian
flag
that
proudly
waves
in
solemn
mockery
land
of
can
you
not
my
friends
understand
the
signs
of
the
times
do
you
not
see
the
sword
of
retributive
justice
hanging
over
the
south
or
are
you
still
slumbering
at
your
posts
are
there
no
shiphrahs
no
puahs
among
you
who
will
dare
in
christian
firmness
and
christian
meekness
to
refuse
to
obey
the
which
require
to
enslave
to
degrade
and
to
brutalize
are
there
no
miriams
who
would
rejoice
to
lead
out
the
captive
daughters
of
the
southern
states
to
liberty
and
light
are
there
no
huldahs
there
who
will
dare
to
the
concerning
the
sins
of
the
people
and
those
judgments
which
it
requires
no
prophet
eye
to
see
must
follow
if
repentance
is
not
speedily
sought
is
there
no
esther
among
you
who
will
plead
for
the
poor
devoted
slave
read
the
history
of
this
persian
queen
it
is
full
of
instruction
she
at
first
refused
to
plead
for
the
jews
but
hear
the
words
of
mordecai
think
not
within
thyself
that
shalt
escape
in
the
king
house
more
than
all
the
jews
for
thou
altogether
holdest
thy
peace
at
this
then
shall
there
enlargement
and
deliverance
arise
to
the
jews
from
another
place
but
and
thy
father
house
shall
be
listen
too
to
her
magnanimous
reply
to
this
powerful
appeal
go
in
unto
the
king
which
is
according
to
law
and
if
i
perish
i
perish
yes
if
there
were
but
esther
at
the
south
she
save
her
country
from
ruin
but
let
the
christian
women
there
arise
as
the
christian
women
of
great
britain
did
in
the
majesty
of
moral
power
and
that
salvation
is
certain
let
them
embody
themselves
in
societies
and
send
petitions
up
to
their
different
legislatures
entreating
their
husbands
fathers
brothers
and
sons
to
abolish
the
institution
of
slavery
no
longer
to
subject
to
the
scourge
and
the
chain
to
mental
darkness
and
moral
degradation
no
longer
to
tear
husbands
from
their
wives
and
children
from
their
parents
no
longer
to
make
men
women
and
children
work
no
longer
to
make
their
lives
bitter
in
hard
bondage
no
longer
to
reduce
to
the
abject
condition
of
of
chattels
personal
no
longer
to
barter
the
of
in
human
shambles
for
corruptible
things
such
as
silver
and
gold
the
of
the
south
can
this
horrible
system
of
oppression
and
cruelty
licentiousness
and
wrong
such
appeals
to
your
legislatures
would
be
irresistible
for
there
is
something
in
the
heart
of
man
which
bend
under
moral
there
is
a
swift
witness
for
truth
in
his
bosom
which
respond
to
when
it
is
uttered
with
calmness
and
dignity
if
you
could
obtain
but
six
signatures
to
such
a
petition
in
only
one
state
i
would
say
send
up
that
petition
and
be
not
in
the
least
discouraged
by
the
scoffs
and
jeers
of
the
heartless
or
the
resolution
of
the
house
to
lay
it
on
the
table
it
will
be
a
great
thing
if
the
subject
can
be
introduced
into
your
legislatures
in
any
way
even
by
and
will
be
the
most
likely
to
introduce
it
there
in
the
best
possible
manner
as
a
matter
of
and
not
of
expediency
or
politics
you
may
petition
too
the
different
ecclesiastical
bodies
of
the
slave
states
slavery
must
be
attacked
with
the
whole
power
of
truth
and
the
sword
of
the
spirit
you
must
take
it
up
on
ground
and
fight
against
it
with
christian
weapons
whilst
your
feet
are
shod
with
the
preparation
of
the
gospel
of
peace
and
are
loudly
called
upon
by
the
cries
of
the
widow
and
the
orphan
to
arise
and
gird
yourselves
for
this
great
moral
conflict
with
the
whole
armour
of
righteousness
on
the
right
hand
and
on
the
left
there
is
every
encouragement
for
you
to
labor
and
pray
my
friends
because
the
abolition
of
slavery
as
well
as
its
existence
has
been
the
theme
of
prophecy
ethiopia
says
the
psalmist
shall
stretch
forth
her
hands
unto
god
and
is
she
not
now
doing
so
are
not
the
christian
negroes
of
the
south
lifting
their
hands
in
prayer
for
deliverance
just
as
the
israelites
did
when
their
redemption
was
drawing
nigh
are
they
not
sighing
and
crying
by
reason
of
the
hard
bondage
and
think
you
that
he
of
whom
it
was
said
and
god
heard
their
groaning
and
their
cry
came
up
unto
him
by
reason
of
the
hard
bondage
think
you
that
his
ear
is
heavy
that
he
can
not
hear
the
cries
of
his
suffering
children
or
that
he
who
raised
up
a
moses
an
aaron
and
a
miriam
to
bring
them
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
from
the
house
of
bondage
can
not
now
with
a
high
hand
and
a
stretched
out
arm
rid
the
poor
negroes
out
of
the
hands
of
their
masters
surely
you
believe
that
his
arm
is
shortened
that
he
can
not
save
and
would
not
such
a
work
of
mercy
redound
to
his
glory
but
another
string
of
the
harp
of
prophecy
vibrates
to
the
song
of
deliverance
but
they
shall
sit
every
man
under
his
vine
and
under
his
and
shall
make
them
for
the
mouth
of
the
lord
of
hosts
hath
spoken
it
the
never
can
do
this
as
long
as
he
is
a
whilst
he
is
a
chattel
personal
he
can
own
property
but
the
time
to
when
man
is
to
sit
under
vine
and
and
no
domineering
driver
or
irresponsible
master
or
irascible
mistress
shall
make
him
afraid
of
the
chain
or
the
whip
hear
too
the
sweet
tones
of
another
string
many
shall
run
to
and
fro
and
shall
be
increased
slavery
is
an
insurmountable
barrier
to
the
increase
of
knowledge
in
every
community
where
it
exists
then
must
be
abolished
this
prediction
can
be
fulfilled
the
last
chord
i
shall
touch
will
be
this
they
shall
hurt
nor
destroy
in
all
my
holy
mountain
then
must
be
overthrown
the
prophecies
can
be
accomplished
but
how
are
they
to
be
fulfilled
will
the
wheels
of
the
millennial
car
be
rolled
onward
by
miraculous
power
no
god
designs
to
confer
this
holy
privilege
upon
it
is
through
instrumentality
that
the
great
and
glorious
work
of
reforming
the
world
is
to
be
done
and
see
you
not
how
the
mighty
engine
of
is
dragging
in
its
rear
the
bible
and
peace
societies
and
temperance
sabbath
schools
moral
reform
and
missions
or
to
adopt
another
figure
do
not
these
seven
philanthropic
associations
compose
the
beautiful
tints
in
that
bow
of
promise
which
spans
the
arch
of
our
moral
heaven
who
does
not
believe
that
if
these
societies
were
broken
up
their
constitutions
burnt
and
the
vast
machinery
with
which
they
are
laboring
to
regenerate
mankind
was
stopped
that
the
black
clouds
of
vengeance
would
soon
burst
over
our
world
and
every
city
would
witness
the
fate
of
the
devoted
cities
of
the
plain
each
one
of
these
societies
is
walking
abroad
through
the
earth
scattering
the
seeds
of
truth
over
the
wide
field
of
our
world
not
with
the
hundred
hands
of
a
briareus
but
with
a
hundred
thousand
another
encouragement
for
you
to
labor
my
friends
is
that
you
will
have
the
prayers
and
of
english
and
northern
philanthropists
you
will
never
bend
your
knees
in
supplication
at
the
throne
of
grace
for
the
overthrow
of
slavery
without
meeting
there
the
spirits
of
other
christians
who
will
mingle
their
voices
with
yours
as
the
morning
or
evening
sacrifice
ascends
to
god
yes
the
spirit
of
prayer
and
of
supplication
has
been
poured
out
upon
many
many
hearts
there
are
wrestling
jacobs
who
will
not
let
go
of
the
prophetic
promises
of
deliverance
for
the
captive
and
the
opening
of
prison
doors
to
them
that
are
bound
there
are
pauls
who
are
saying
in
reference
to
this
subject
lord
what
wilt
thou
have
me
to
do
there
are
marys
sitting
in
the
house
now
who
are
ready
to
arise
and
go
forth
in
this
work
as
soon
as
the
message
is
brought
the
master
is
come
and
calleth
for
thee
and
there
are
marthas
too
who
have
already
gone
out
to
meet
jesus
as
he
bends
his
footsteps
to
their
brother
grave
and
weeps
over
the
lifeless
body
of
lazarus
bound
hand
and
foot
in
but
over
the
politically
and
intellectually
lifeless
slave
bound
hand
and
foot
in
the
iron
chains
of
oppression
and
ignorance
some
may
be
ready
to
say
as
martha
did
who
seemed
to
expect
nothing
but
sympathy
from
jesus
lord
by
this
time
he
stinketh
for
he
hath
been
dead
four
days
she
thought
it
useless
to
remove
the
stone
and
expose
the
loathsome
body
of
her
brother
she
could
not
believe
that
so
great
a
miracle
could
be
wrought
as
to
raise
putrified
into
life
but
jesus
said
take
away
the
stone
and
when
had
taken
away
the
stone
where
the
dead
was
laid
and
uncovered
the
body
of
lazarus
then
it
was
that
jesus
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
said
father
i
thank
thee
that
thou
hast
heard
me
and
when
he
had
thus
spoken
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice
lazarus
come
forth
yes
some
may
be
ready
to
say
of
the
colored
race
how
can
ever
be
raised
politically
and
intellectually
they
have
been
dead
four
hundred
years
but
have
to
do
with
this
is
to
be
done
is
to
take
away
the
stone
which
has
covered
up
the
dead
body
of
our
brother
to
expose
the
putrid
carcass
to
show
that
body
has
been
bound
with
the
of
heathen
ignorance
and
his
face
with
the
napkin
of
prejudice
and
having
done
all
it
was
our
duty
to
do
to
stand
by
the
negro
grave
in
humble
faith
and
holy
hope
waiting
to
hear
the
command
of
lazarus
come
forth
this
is
just
what
societies
are
doing
they
are
taking
away
the
stone
from
the
mouth
of
the
tomb
of
slavery
where
lies
the
putrid
carcass
of
our
brother
they
want
the
pure
light
of
heaven
to
shine
into
that
dark
and
gloomy
cave
they
want
all
men
to
see
that
dead
body
has
been
bound
that
face
has
been
wrapped
in
the
of
and
shall
they
wait
beside
that
grave
in
vain
is
not
jesus
still
the
resurrection
and
the
life
did
he
come
to
proclaim
liberty
to
the
captive
and
the
opening
of
prison
doors
to
them
that
are
bound
in
vain
did
he
promise
to
give
beauty
for
ashes
the
oil
of
joy
for
mourning
and
the
garment
of
praise
for
the
spirit
of
heaviness
unto
them
that
mourn
in
zion
and
will
he
refuse
to
beautify
the
mind
anoint
the
head
and
throw
around
the
captive
negro
the
mantle
of
praise
for
that
spirit
of
heaviness
which
has
so
long
bowed
him
down
to
the
ground
or
shall
we
not
rather
say
with
the
prophet
the
zeal
of
the
lord
of
hosts
perform
this
yes
his
promises
are
sure
and
amen
in
christ
jesus
that
he
will
assemble
her
that
halteth
and
gather
her
that
is
driven
out
and
her
that
is
afflicted
but
i
will
now
say
a
few
words
on
the
subject
of
abolitionism
doubtless
you
have
all
heard
societies
denounced
as
insurrectionary
and
mischievous
fanatical
and
dangerous
it
has
been
said
they
publish
the
most
abominable
untruths
and
that
they
are
endeavoring
to
excite
rebellions
at
the
south
have
you
believed
these
reports
my
friends
have
also
been
deceived
by
these
false
assertions
listen
to
me
then
whilst
i
endeavor
to
wipe
from
the
fair
character
of
abolitionism
such
unfounded
accusations
you
know
that
am
a
southerner
your
know
that
my
dearest
relatives
are
now
in
a
slave
state
can
you
for
a
moment
believe
i
would
prove
so
recreant
to
the
feelings
of
a
daughter
and
a
sister
as
to
join
a
society
which
seeking
to
overthrow
slavery
by
falsehood
bloodshed
and
murder
i
appeal
to
you
who
have
known
and
loved
me
in
days
that
are
passed
can
believe
it
no
my
friends
as
a
carolinian
i
was
peculiarly
jealous
of
any
movements
on
this
subject
and
before
i
would
join
an
society
i
took
the
precaution
of
becoming
acquainted
with
some
of
the
leading
abolitionists
of
reading
their
publications
and
attending
their
meetings
at
which
i
heard
addresses
both
from
colored
and
white
men
and
it
was
not
until
i
was
fully
convinced
that
their
principles
were
pacific
and
their
efforts
moral
that
i
gave
my
name
as
a
member
to
the
female
society
of
philadelphia
since
that
time
i
have
regularly
taken
the
liberator
and
read
many
pamphlets
and
papers
and
books
and
can
assure
you
i
have
seen
a
single
insurrectionary
paragraph
and
never
read
any
account
of
cruelty
which
i
could
not
believe
southerners
may
deny
the
truth
of
these
accounts
but
why
do
they
not
them
to
be
false
their
violent
expressions
of
horror
at
such
accounts
being
believed
deceive
some
but
they
can
not
deceive
for
i
lived
too
long
in
the
midst
of
slavery
not
to
know
what
slavery
is
such
declarations
remind
me
of
an
assertion
made
by
a
catholic
priest
who
said
that
his
church
had
never
persecuted
protestants
for
their
religion
when
it
is
well
known
that
the
pages
of
history
are
black
with
the
crimes
of
the
inquisition
oh
if
the
slaves
of
the
south
could
only
write
a
book
it
would
vie
i
have
no
doubt
with
the
horrible
details
of
catholic
cruelty
when
speak
of
this
system
i
speak
that
i
do
know
and
i
am
not
afraid
to
assert
that
publications
have
overdrawn
the
monstrous
features
of
slavery
at
all
and
many
a
southerner
this
as
well
as
i
do
a
lady
in
north
carolina
remarked
to
a
friend
of
mine
about
eighteen
months
since
northerners
know
nothing
at
all
about
slavery
they
think
it
is
perpetual
bondage
only
but
of
the
of
that
word
involves
they
have
no
conception
if
they
had
would
never
their
efforts
until
so
a
system
was
overthrown
she
did
not
know
how
faithfully
some
northern
men
and
northern
women
had
studied
this
subject
how
diligently
they
had
searched
out
the
cause
of
him
who
had
none
to
help
him
and
how
fearlessly
they
had
told
the
story
of
the
negro
wrongs
yes
northerners
know
thing
about
slavery
now
this
monster
of
iniquity
has
been
unveiled
to
the
world
his
frightful
features
unmasked
and
soon
very
soon
will
he
be
regarded
with
no
more
complacency
by
the
american
republic
than
is
the
idol
of
juggernaut
rolling
its
bloody
wheels
over
the
crushed
bodies
of
its
prostrate
victims
but
you
will
probably
ask
if
societies
are
not
insurrectionary
why
do
northerners
tell
us
they
are
why
i
would
ask
you
in
return
did
northern
senators
and
northern
representatives
give
their
votes
at
the
last
sitting
of
congress
to
the
admission
of
arkansas
territory
as
a
slave
state
take
those
men
one
by
one
and
ask
them
in
their
parlours
do
you
of
slavery
ask
them
on
ground
where
they
will
speak
the
truth
and
i
doubt
not
of
them
will
tell
you
why
then
i
ask
did
give
their
votes
to
enlarge
the
mouth
of
that
grave
which
has
already
destroyed
its
tens
of
thousands
all
our
enemies
tell
they
are
as
much
anti
slavery
as
we
are
yes
my
friends
thousands
who
are
helping
you
to
bind
the
fetters
of
slavery
on
the
negro
despise
you
in
their
hearts
for
doing
it
they
rejoice
that
such
an
institution
has
not
been
entailed
upon
them
why
then
i
would
ask
do
lend
you
their
help
i
will
tell
you
they
love
praise
of
men
than
the
praise
of
god
the
abolition
cause
has
not
yet
become
so
popular
as
to
induce
them
to
believe
that
by
advocating
it
in
congress
they
shall
sit
still
more
securely
in
their
seats
there
and
like
the
in
the
days
of
our
saviour
though
believed
on
him
yet
they
did
confess
him
lest
they
should
put
out
of
the
john
xii
or
perhaps
like
pilate
thinking
they
could
prevail
nothing
and
fearing
a
tumult
they
determined
to
release
barabbas
and
surrender
the
just
man
the
poor
innocent
slave
to
be
stripped
of
his
rights
and
scourged
in
vain
will
such
men
try
to
wash
their
hands
and
say
with
the
roman
governor
i
am
innocent
of
the
blood
of
this
just
person
northern
american
statesmen
are
no
more
innocent
of
the
crime
of
slavery
than
pilate
was
of
the
murder
of
jesus
or
saul
of
that
of
stephen
these
are
high
charges
but
i
appeal
to
i
appeal
to
public
opinion
ten
years
from
now
slavery
then
is
a
national
sin
but
you
will
say
a
great
many
other
northerners
tell
us
so
who
can
have
no
political
motives
the
interests
of
the
north
you
must
know
my
friends
are
very
closely
combined
with
those
of
the
south
the
northern
merchants
and
manufacturers
are
making
fortunes
out
of
the
of
slave
the
grocer
is
selling
your
rice
and
sugar
how
then
can
these
men
bear
a
testimony
against
slavery
without
condemning
themselves
but
there
is
another
reason
the
north
is
most
dreadfully
afraid
of
amalgamation
she
is
alarmed
at
the
very
idea
of
a
thing
so
monstrous
as
she
thinks
and
lest
this
consequence
flow
from
emancipation
she
is
determined
to
resist
all
efforts
at
emancipation
without
expatriation
it
is
not
because
she
of
or
believes
it
to
be
the
corner
stone
of
our
republic
for
she
is
as
much
as
we
are
but
amalgamation
is
too
horrible
to
think
of
now
i
would
ask
is
it
right
is
it
generous
to
refuse
the
colored
people
in
this
country
the
advantages
of
education
and
the
privilege
or
rather
the
to
follow
honest
trades
and
callings
merely
because
they
are
colored
the
same
prejudice
exists
here
against
our
colored
brethren
that
existed
against
the
gentiles
in
judea
great
numbers
can
not
bear
the
idea
of
equality
and
fearing
lest
if
they
had
the
same
advantages
we
enjoy
they
would
become
as
intelligent
as
moral
as
religious
and
as
respectable
and
wealthy
they
are
determined
to
keep
them
as
low
as
they
possibly
can
is
this
doing
as
they
would
be
done
by
is
this
loving
their
neighbor
as
oh
that
opposers
of
abolitionism
would
put
their
souls
in
the
stead
of
the
free
colored
man
and
obey
the
apostolic
injunction
to
remember
them
that
are
in
bonds
bound
with
i
will
leave
you
to
judge
whether
the
fear
of
amalgamation
ought
to
induce
men
to
oppose
efforts
when
believe
to
be
prejudice
against
color
is
the
most
powerful
enemy
we
have
to
fight
with
at
the
north
you
need
not
be
surprised
then
at
all
at
what
is
said
abolitionists
by
the
north
for
they
are
wielding
a
sword
which
even
here
cuts
through
the
of
on
the
one
side
and
the
of
on
the
other
they
are
only
sharing
the
fate
of
other
reformers
abused
and
reviled
whilst
they
are
in
the
minority
but
they
are
neither
angry
nor
discouraged
by
the
invective
which
has
been
heaped
upon
them
by
slaveholders
at
the
south
and
their
apologists
at
the
north
they
know
that
when
george
fox
and
william
edmundson
were
laboring
in
behalf
of
the
negroes
in
the
west
indies
in
that
the
very
slanders
were
propogated
against
them
which
are
circulated
against
abolitionists
although
it
was
well
known
that
fox
was
the
founder
of
a
religious
sect
which
repudiated
war
and
violence
yet
was
accused
of
endeavoring
to
excite
the
slaves
to
insurrection
and
of
teaching
the
negroes
to
cut
their
throats
and
these
two
men
who
had
their
feet
shod
with
the
preparation
of
the
gospel
of
peace
were
actually
compelled
to
draw
up
a
formal
declaration
that
were
trying
to
raise
a
rebellion
in
barbadoes
it
is
also
worthy
of
remark
that
these
reformers
did
not
at
this
time
see
the
necessity
of
emancipation
under
seven
years
and
their
principal
efforts
were
exerted
to
persuade
the
planters
of
the
necessity
of
instructing
their
slaves
but
the
slaveholder
saw
then
just
what
the
slaveholder
sees
now
that
an
population
can
be
a
population
and
therefore
they
passed
a
law
that
negroes
should
not
even
attend
the
meetings
of
friends
abolitionists
know
that
the
life
of
clarkson
was
sought
by
slavetraders
and
that
even
wilberforce
was
denounced
on
the
floor
of
parliament
as
a
fanatic
and
a
hypocrite
by
the
present
king
of
england
the
very
man
who
in
set
his
seal
to
that
instrument
which
burst
the
fetters
of
eight
hundred
thousand
slaves
in
his
west
india
colonies
they
know
that
the
first
quaker
who
bore
a
testimony
against
the
sin
of
slavery
was
cut
off
from
religious
fellowship
with
that
society
that
quaker
was
a
on
her
deathbed
she
sent
for
the
committee
who
dealt
with
her
she
told
them
the
near
approach
of
death
had
not
altered
her
sentiments
on
the
subject
of
slavery
and
waving
her
hand
towards
a
very
fertile
and
beautiful
portion
of
country
which
lay
stretched
before
her
window
she
said
with
great
solemnity
friends
the
time
will
come
when
there
will
not
be
friends
enough
in
all
this
district
to
hold
one
meeting
for
worship
and
this
garden
will
be
turned
into
a
wilderness
the
aged
friend
who
with
tears
in
his
eyes
related
this
interesting
circumstance
to
me
remarked
that
at
that
time
there
were
seven
meetings
of
friends
in
that
part
of
virginia
but
that
when
he
was
there
ten
years
ago
not
a
single
meeting
was
held
and
the
country
was
literally
a
desolation
soon
after
her
decease
john
woolman
began
his
labors
in
our
society
and
instead
of
disowning
a
member
for
testifying
slavery
they
have
for
years
positively
forbidden
their
members
to
hold
slaves
abolitionists
understand
the
slaveholding
spirit
too
well
to
be
surprised
at
any
thing
that
has
yet
happened
at
the
south
or
the
north
they
know
that
the
greater
the
sin
is
which
is
exposed
the
more
violent
will
be
the
efforts
to
blacken
the
character
and
impugn
the
motives
of
those
who
are
engaged
in
bringing
to
light
the
hidden
things
of
darkness
they
understand
the
work
of
reform
too
well
to
be
driven
back
by
the
furious
waves
of
opposition
which
are
only
foaming
out
their
own
shame
they
have
stood
the
world
dread
laugh
when
only
twelve
men
formed
the
first
society
in
boston
in
they
have
faced
and
refuted
the
calumnies
of
their
enemies
and
proved
themselves
to
be
emphatically
by
the
violence
of
mobs
even
when
driven
by
them
from
the
temple
of
god
and
dragged
by
an
infuriated
crowd
through
the
streets
of
the
emporium
of
or
subjected
by
to
the
pain
of
corporal
punishment
none
of
these
things
move
them
and
by
the
grace
of
god
they
are
determined
to
persevere
in
this
work
of
faith
and
labor
of
love
they
mean
to
pray
and
preach
and
write
and
print
until
slavery
is
completely
overthrown
until
babylon
is
taken
up
and
cast
into
the
sea
to
be
found
no
more
at
all
they
mean
to
petition
congress
year
after
year
until
the
seat
of
our
government
is
cleansed
from
the
sinful
traffic
of
slaves
and
the
souls
of
men
although
that
august
assembly
may
be
like
the
unjust
judge
who
feared
not
god
neither
regarded
man
yet
it
yield
just
as
he
did
from
the
power
of
importunity
like
the
unjust
judge
congress
redress
the
wrongs
of
the
widow
lest
by
the
continual
coming
up
of
petitions
it
be
wearied
this
will
be
striking
the
dagger
into
the
very
heart
of
the
monster
and
once
this
done
he
must
soon
expire
abolitionists
have
been
accused
of
abusing
their
southern
brethren
did
the
prophet
isaiah
the
jews
when
he
addressed
to
them
the
cutting
reproof
contained
in
the
first
chapter
of
his
prophecies
and
ended
by
telling
them
they
would
be
of
the
oaks
they
had
desired
and
for
the
garden
they
had
chosen
did
john
the
baptist
the
jews
when
he
called
them
generation
of
and
warned
them
to
bring
forth
fruits
meet
for
repentance
did
peter
abuse
the
jews
when
he
told
them
they
were
the
murderers
of
the
lord
of
glory
did
paul
abuse
the
roman
governor
when
he
reasoned
before
him
of
righteousness
temperance
and
judgment
so
as
to
send
conviction
home
to
his
guilty
heart
and
cause
him
to
tremble
in
view
of
the
crimes
he
was
living
in
surely
not
no
man
will
accuse
the
prophets
and
apostles
of
but
what
have
abolitionists
done
more
than
they
no
doubt
the
jews
thought
the
prophets
and
apostles
in
their
day
just
as
harsh
and
uncharitable
as
slaveholders
now
think
abolitionists
if
they
did
not
why
did
they
beat
and
stone
and
kill
them
great
fault
has
been
found
with
the
prints
which
have
been
employed
to
expose
slavery
at
the
north
but
my
friends
how
could
this
be
done
so
effectively
in
any
other
way
until
the
pictures
of
the
sufferings
were
drawn
and
held
up
to
public
gaze
no
northerner
had
any
idea
of
the
cruelty
of
the
system
it
never
entered
their
minds
that
such
abominations
could
exist
in
christian
republican
america
they
never
suspected
that
many
of
the
and
who
came
from
the
south
to
spend
the
summer
months
in
traveling
among
them
were
petty
tyrants
at
home
and
those
who
had
lived
at
the
south
and
came
to
reside
at
the
north
were
too
of
even
to
speak
of
it
the
language
of
their
hearts
was
tell
it
in
gath
publish
it
in
the
streets
of
askelon
they
saw
no
use
in
uncovering
the
loathsome
body
to
popular
sight
and
in
hopeless
despair
wept
in
secret
places
over
the
sins
of
oppression
to
such
hidden
mourners
the
formation
of
societies
was
as
life
from
the
dead
the
first
beams
of
hope
which
gleamed
through
the
dark
clouds
of
despondency
and
grief
prints
were
made
use
of
to
effect
the
abolition
of
the
inquisition
in
spain
and
clarkson
employed
them
when
he
was
laboring
to
break
up
the
slave
trade
and
english
abolitionists
used
them
just
as
we
are
now
doing
they
are
powerful
appeals
and
have
invariably
done
the
work
they
were
designed
to
do
and
we
can
not
consent
to
abandon
the
use
of
these
until
the
no
longer
exist
with
regard
to
those
white
men
who
it
was
said
did
try
to
raise
an
insurrection
in
mississippi
a
year
ago
and
who
were
stated
to
be
abolitionists
none
of
them
were
proved
to
be
members
of
societies
and
it
must
remain
a
matter
of
great
doubt
whether
even
they
were
guilty
of
the
crimes
alledged
against
them
because
when
any
community
is
thrown
into
such
a
panic
as
to
inflict
lynch
law
upon
accused
persons
they
can
not
be
supposed
to
be
capable
of
judging
with
calmness
and
impartiality
that
the
papers
of
which
the
charleston
mail
was
robbed
were
insurrectionary
and
that
they
were
sent
to
the
colored
people
as
was
reported
that
amos
dresser
was
though
he
was
accused
of
being
so
and
on
this
false
accusation
was
publicly
whipped
in
nashville
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
of
infuriated
was
that
young
man
disgraced
by
this
infliction
of
corporal
punishment
no
more
than
was
the
great
apostle
of
the
gentile
who
five
times
received
forty
stripes
save
one
like
him
he
might
have
said
henceforth
i
bear
in
my
body
the
marks
of
the
lord
jesus
for
it
was
for
the
sake
he
as
much
as
did
the
apostle
paul
are
nelson
and
garrett
and
williams
and
other
abolitionists
who
have
recently
been
banished
from
missouri
insurrectionists
they
are
whatever
slaveholders
may
choose
to
call
them
the
spirit
which
now
asperses
the
character
of
the
abolitionists
is
the
which
dressed
up
the
christians
of
spain
in
the
skins
of
wild
beasts
and
pictures
of
devils
when
they
were
led
to
execution
as
heretics
before
we
condemn
individuals
it
is
necessary
even
in
a
wicked
community
to
accuse
them
of
some
crime
hence
when
jezebel
wished
to
compass
the
death
of
naboth
men
of
belial
were
suborned
to
bear
false
witness
against
him
and
so
it
was
with
stephen
and
so
it
ever
has
been
and
ever
will
be
as
long
as
there
is
any
virtue
to
suffer
on
the
rack
or
the
gallows
witnesses
must
appear
against
abolitionists
before
they
can
be
condemned
i
will
now
say
a
few
words
on
george
thompson
mission
to
this
country
this
philanthropist
was
accused
of
being
a
foreign
emissary
were
lafayette
and
steuben
and
de
kalb
and
pulawski
foreign
emissaries
when
they
came
over
to
america
to
fight
against
the
tories
who
preferred
submitting
to
what
was
termed
the
yoke
of
servitude
rather
than
bursting
the
fetters
which
bound
them
to
the
mother
country
came
with
to
engage
in
conflict
against
american
citizens
and
yet
where
do
their
names
stand
on
the
page
of
history
among
the
honorable
or
the
base
thompson
came
here
to
war
against
the
giant
sin
of
slavery
with
the
sword
and
the
pistol
but
with
the
smooth
stones
of
oratory
taken
from
the
pure
waters
of
the
river
of
truth
his
splendid
talents
and
commanding
eloquence
rendered
him
a
powerful
coadjutor
in
the
cause
and
in
order
to
neutralize
the
effects
of
these
upon
his
auditors
and
rob
the
poor
slave
of
the
benefits
of
his
labors
his
character
was
defamed
his
life
was
sought
and
he
at
last
driven
from
our
republic
as
a
fugitive
but
was
disgraced
by
all
this
mean
and
contemptible
and
wicked
chicanery
and
malice
no
more
than
was
paul
when
in
consequence
of
a
vision
he
had
seen
at
treas
he
went
over
the
macedonia
to
help
the
christians
there
and
was
beaten
and
imprisoned
because
he
cast
out
a
spirit
of
divination
from
a
young
damsel
which
had
brought
much
gain
to
her
masters
paul
was
as
much
a
in
the
roman
colony
of
philippi
as
george
thompson
was
in
america
and
it
was
because
he
was
a
and
taught
customs
it
was
not
lawful
for
them
to
receive
or
observe
being
romans
that
the
apostle
was
thus
treated
it
was
said
thompson
was
a
felon
who
had
fled
to
this
country
to
escape
transportation
to
new
holland
look
at
him
now
pouring
the
thundering
strains
of
his
eloquence
upon
crowded
audiences
in
great
britain
and
see
in
this
a
triumphant
vindication
of
his
character
and
have
the
slaveholder
and
his
obsequious
apologist
gained
anything
by
all
their
violence
and
falsehood
no
for
the
stone
which
struck
goliath
of
gath
had
already
been
thrown
from
the
sling
the
giant
of
slavery
who
had
so
proudly
defied
the
armies
of
the
living
god
had
received
his
before
he
left
our
shores
but
what
is
george
thompson
doing
there
is
he
not
now
laboring
there
as
effectually
to
abolish
american
slavery
as
though
he
trod
our
own
soil
and
lectured
to
new
york
or
boston
assemblies
what
is
he
doing
there
but
constructing
a
stupendous
dam
which
will
turn
the
overwhelming
tide
of
public
opinion
over
the
wheels
of
that
machinery
which
abolitionists
are
working
here
he
is
now
lecturing
to
on
to
the
of
a
on
the
abject
condition
of
the
of
a
he
is
telling
them
of
that
mighty
confederacy
of
petty
tyrants
which
extends
over
thirteen
states
of
our
union
he
is
telling
them
of
the
munificent
rewards
offered
by
slaveholders
for
the
heads
of
the
most
distinguished
advocates
for
freedom
in
this
country
he
is
moving
the
british
churches
to
send
out
to
the
churches
of
america
the
most
solemn
appeals
reproving
rebuking
and
exhorting
them
with
all
long
suffering
and
patience
to
abandon
the
sin
of
slavery
immediately
where
then
i
ask
will
the
name
of
george
thompson
stand
on
the
page
of
history
among
the
honorable
or
the
base
what
can
i
say
more
my
friends
to
induce
you
to
set
your
hands
and
heads
and
hearts
to
the
great
work
of
justice
and
mercy
perhaps
you
have
feared
the
consequences
of
immediate
emancipation
and
been
frightened
by
all
those
dreadful
prophecies
of
rebellion
bloodshed
and
murder
which
have
been
uttered
let
no
man
deceive
you
they
are
the
predictions
of
that
same
lying
spirit
which
spoke
through
the
four
hundred
prophets
of
old
to
ahab
king
of
israel
urging
him
on
to
destruction
may
produce
these
horrible
scenes
if
it
is
continued
five
years
longer
but
emancipation
i
can
prove
the
of
immediate
emancipation
by
history
in
domingo
in
six
hundred
thousand
slaves
were
set
free
in
a
white
population
of
thousand
that
island
marched
as
by
enchantment
towards
its
ancient
splendor
cultivation
prospered
every
day
produced
perceptible
proofs
of
its
progress
and
the
negroes
all
continued
quietly
to
work
on
the
different
plantations
until
in
france
determined
to
reduce
these
liberated
slaves
again
to
bondage
it
was
at
that
all
those
dreadful
scenes
of
cruelty
occurred
which
we
so
often
hear
spoken
of
as
the
effects
of
abolition
they
were
occasioned
by
emancipation
but
by
the
base
attempt
to
fasten
the
chains
of
slavery
on
the
limbs
of
liberated
slaves
in
guadaloupe
thousand
slaves
were
freed
in
a
white
population
of
thirteen
thousand
the
same
prosperous
effects
followed
manumission
here
that
had
attended
it
in
hayti
every
thing
was
quiet
until
buonaparte
sent
out
a
fleet
to
reduce
these
negroes
again
to
slavery
and
in
this
institution
was
in
that
island
in
when
great
britain
determined
to
liberate
the
slaves
in
her
west
india
colonies
and
proposed
the
apprenticeship
system
the
planters
of
bermuda
and
antigua
after
having
joined
the
other
planters
in
their
representations
of
the
bloody
consequences
of
emancipation
in
order
if
possible
to
hold
back
the
hand
which
was
offering
the
boon
of
freedom
to
the
poor
negro
as
soon
as
they
found
such
falsehoods
were
utterly
disregarded
and
abolition
must
take
place
came
forward
voluntarily
and
asked
for
the
compensation
which
was
due
to
them
saying
preferred
immediate
and
were
not
afraid
of
any
insurrection
and
how
is
it
with
these
islands
now
they
are
decidedly
more
prosperous
than
any
of
those
on
which
the
apprenticeship
system
was
adopted
and
england
is
now
trying
to
abolish
that
system
so
fully
convinced
is
she
that
immediate
emancipation
is
the
and
the
best
plan
and
why
not
try
it
in
the
southern
states
if
it
has
occasioned
rebellion
if
a
drop
of
has
ever
been
shed
in
consequence
of
it
though
it
has
been
so
often
tried
why
should
we
suppose
it
would
produce
such
disastrous
consequences
now
be
not
deceived
then
god
is
not
mocked
by
such
false
excuses
for
not
doing
justly
and
loving
mercy
there
is
nothing
to
fear
from
immediate
emancipation
but
from
the
continuance
of
slavery
sisters
in
christ
i
have
done
as
a
southerner
i
have
felt
it
was
my
duty
to
address
you
i
have
endeavoured
to
set
before
you
the
exceeding
sinfulness
of
slavery
and
to
point
you
to
the
example
of
those
noble
women
who
have
been
raised
up
in
the
church
to
effect
great
revolutions
and
to
suffer
for
the
truth
sake
i
have
appealed
to
your
sympathies
as
women
to
your
sense
of
duty
as
i
have
attempted
to
vindicate
the
abolitionists
to
prove
the
entire
safety
of
immediate
emancipation
and
to
plead
the
cause
of
the
poor
and
oppressed
i
have
done
i
have
sowed
the
seeds
of
truth
but
i
well
know
that
even
if
an
apollos
were
to
follow
in
my
steps
to
water
them
can
give
the
increase
to
him
then
who
is
able
to
prosper
the
work
of
his
servant

i
commend
this
appeal
in
fervent
prayer
that
as
he
hath
the
weak
things
of
the
to
confound
the
things
which
are
mighty
so
he
may
guise
his
blessing
to
descend
and
carry
conviction
to
the
hearts
of
many
lydias
through
these
speaking

farewell

mississippi
sir
accept
my
thanks
for
your
politeness
in
sending
me
a
copy
of
your
book
on
slavery
this
book
proves
that
the
often
repeated
assertion
that
the
whole
south
is
opposed
to
the
discussion
of
the
question
of
slavery
is
not
true
and
so
far
i
rejoice
in
its
appearance
i
presume
i
know
indeed
that
you
are
not
the
only
man
in
the
south
who
is
in
favor
of
this
discussion
there
are
doubtless
many
persons
in
the
south
who
believe
that
all
attempts
to
suppress
it
are
vain
as
well
as
wicked
besides
you
virtually
admit
that
the
south
is
compelled
to
discuss
the
question
of
slavery
or
at
least
to
give
her
own
views
of
it
in
order
to
prevent
the
conscience
of
southern
christians
that
conscience
which
does
make
cowards
of
us
all
from
turning
traitor
to
the
cause
of
slavery
i
rejoice
too
that
you
accompanied
the
copy
sent
to
me
with
the
request
that
i
should
review
it
and
make
candid
remarks
upon
it
and
that
you
have
thus
put
it
in
my
power
to
send
to
the
south
some
of
my
views
on
slavery
without
laying
myself
open
to
the
charge
of
being
discourteous
and
obtrusive
you
undertake
to
show
that
slavery
existed
and
with
the
divine
approbation
amongst
the
old
testament
jews
and
that
it
also
existed
whilst
our
saviour
and
his
apostles
were
on
the
earth
and
was
approved
by
them
you
thence
argue
that
it
is
not
only
an
innocent
institution
but
one
which
it
is
a
religious
duty
to
maintain
i
admit
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
there
was
a
servitude
in
the
patriarchal
families
which
was
approved
by
god
but
what
does
this
avail
in
your
defence
of
slavery
unless
you
show
that
that
servitude
and
slavery
are
essentially
alike
the
literal
terms
of
the
relation
of
master
and
servant
under
that
servitude
are
not
made
known
to
us
but
we
can
nevertheless
confidently
infer
their
spirit
from
facts
which
illustrate
their
practical
character
and
if
this
character
be
found
to
be
opposite
to
that
of
slavery
then
it
is
manifest
that
what
you
say
of
patriarchal
servitude
is
impertinent
and
tends
to
mislead
rather
than
enlighten
your
readers
to
a
few
of
these
facts
and
a
few
of
the
considerations
arising
from
them
i
now
call
your
attention
read
the
first
eight
verses
of
the
eighteenth
chapter
of
genesis
and
tell
me
if
you
ever
saw
gov
mcduffie
or
any
other
southern
patriarch
for
the
governor
desires
to
have
all
slaveholders
looked
upon
in
the
character
of
patriarchs
putting
himself
on
a
level
with
his
servants
and
working
with
his
hands
after
the
manner
of
abraham
and
sarah
there
was
such
a
community
of
interest
so
much
of
mutual
confidence
between
abraham
and
his
servants
that
they
fought
his
battles
indeed
the
terms
of
this
patriarchal
servitude
were
such
that
in
the
event
of
the
master
dying
without
issue
one
of
his
servants
inherited
his
property
but
according
to
the
code
of
southern
slavery
the
slave
can
no
more
own
property
than
he
can
own
himself
all
that
a
slave
possesses
belongs
to
his
master
slaves
are
incapable
of
inheriting
or
transmitting
property
these
and
many
similar
phrases
are
found
in
that
code
severe
as
was
the
system
of
roman
slavery
yet
in
this
respect
it
was
far
milder
than
yours
for
its
subjects
could
acquire
property
their
peculium
and
frequently
did
they
purchase
their
liberty
with
it
so
far
from
southern
slaves
being
as
abraham
servants
were
a
dependence
in
war
it
is
historically
true
that
they
are
accustomed
to
improve
this
occasion
to
effect
their
escape
and
strengthen
the
hands
of
the
enemy
as
a
further
proof
that
southern
slavery
begets
none
of
that
confidence
between
master
and
slave
which
characterized
the
mutual
intercourse
of
abraham
and
his
servants
the
slave
is
prohibited
under
severe
penalties
from
having
any
weapons
in
his
possession
even
in
time
of
peace
and
the
nightly
patrol
which
the
whites
of
southern
towns
keep
up
in
peace
as
well
as
in
war
argues
any
thing
rather
than
the
existence
of
such
confidence
for
keeping
or
carrying
a
gun
or
powder
or
shot
or
a
club
or
other
weapon
whatsoever
offensive
or
defensive
a
slave
incurs
says
southern
statute
book
for
each
offence
lashes
when
i
read
your
quotation
from
the
chapter
of
genesis
made
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
god
allowed
abraham
to
have
slaves
i
could
not
but
wonder
at
your
imprudence
in
meddling
with
this
chapter
which
is
of
itself
enough
to
convince
any
unbiased
mind
that
abraham
servants
held
a
relation
to
their
master
and
to
society
totally
different
from
that
held
by
southern
slaves
have
you
ever
known
a
great
man
in
your
state
send
his
slave
into
another
to
choose
a
wife
for
his
son
and
if
so
did
the
lily
white
damsel
he
selected
call
the
sable
servant
my
lord
and
did
her
family
spare
no
pains
to
manifest
respect
for
their
distinguished
guest
and
promote
his
comfort
but
this
chapter
which
you
call
to
your
aid
informs
us
that
abraham
servant
was
honored
with
such
tokens
of
confidence
and
esteem
if
a
southern
slave
shall
ever
be
employed
in
such
a
mission
he
may
count
himself
highly
favored
if
he
be
not
taken
up
by
the
way
imprisoned
and
sold
for
his
jail
fees
did
you
ever
know
southern
slaves
contend
for
their
rights
with
their
masters
when
a
southern
master
reads
the
thirteenth
verse
of
the
chapter
of
job
he
must
think
that
job
was
in
the
habit
of
letting
down
his
dignity
very
low
do
southern
masters
accord
religious
privileges
and
impart
religious
instruction
equally
to
their
slaves
and
their
children
your
laws
which
visit
with
stripes
imprisonment
and
death
the
attempt
to
teach
slaves
to
read
the
bible
show
but
too
certainly
that
the
southern
master
who
should
undertake
to
place
his
children
and
his
household
on
the
same
level
in
respect
to
their
religious
advantages
as
it
is
probable
that
abraham
did
would
soon
find
himself
in
the
midst
of
enemies
not
to
his
reputation
only
but
to
his
life
also
and
now
sir
admitting
that
the
phrase
on
which
you
lay
so
much
stress
bought
with
his
money
was
used
in
connexion
with
a
form
of
servitude
which
god
approved
i
put
it
to
your
candor
whether
this
phrase
should
be
allowed
to
weigh
at
all
against
the
facts
i
have
adduced
and
the
reasonings
i
have
employed
to
show
the
true
nature
of
that
servitude
and
how
totally
unlike
it
is
to
slavery
are
you
not
bound
by
the
principles
of
sound
reasoning
to
attach
to
it
a
meaning
far
short
of
what
i
grant
is
its
natural
import
in
this
age
and
especially
amongst
a
people
who
like
ourselves
are
accustomed
to
associate
such
an
expression
with
slavery
can
you
deny
that
you
are
bound
to
adopt
such
a
meaning
of
it
as
shall
harmonize
with
the
facts
which
illustrate
the
nature
of
the
servitude
in
question
and
with
the
laws
and
character
of
him
whose
sanction
you
claim
for
that
servitude
an
opposite
course
would
give
a
preference
to
words
over
things
which
common
sense
could
not
tolerate
many
instances
might
be
cited
to
show
the
absurdity
of
the
assumption
that
whatever
is
spoken
of
in
the
scriptures
as
being
bought
is
property
boaz
purchased
his
wife
hosea
bought
her
his
wife
for
fifteen
pieces
of
silver
jacob
to
use
a
common
expression
took
his
wages
in
wives
joseph
bought
the
egyptians
after
they
had
said
to
him
buy
us
but
so
far
from
their
having
become
the
property
of
joseph
or
of
his
king
it
was
a
part
of
the
bargain
that
they
were
to
have
as
much
land
as
they
wanted
seed
to
sow
it
and
of
the
crops
the
possessors
of
such
independence
and
such
means
of
wealth
are
not
the
property
of
their
i
need
say
no
more
to
prove
that
slavery
is
entirely
unlike
the
servitude
in
the
patriarchal
families
i
pass
on
now
to
the
period
between
the
promulgation
of
the
divine
law
by
moses
and
the
birth
of
christ
you
argue
from
the
fifth
and
sixth
verses
of
the
chapter
of
exodus
that
god
authorized
the
enslavement
of
the
jews
but
on
the
same
page
on
which
you
do
so
you
also
show
the
contrary
it
may
nevertheless
be
well
for
me
to
request
you
to
read
and
read
again
leviticus
until
your
remaining
doubts
on
this
point
shall
all
be
put
to
flight
i
am
free
to
admit
the
probability
that
under
some
of
the
forms
of
servitude
in
which
jews
were
held
the
servant
was
subjected
to
a
control
so
extensive
as
to
expose
him
to
suffer
great
cruelties
these
forms
corresponded
with
the
spirit
and
usages
of
the
age
in
which
they
existed
entirely
unsuited
as
they
are
to
a
period
and
portion
of
the
world
blessed
with
the
refining
and
softening
influences
of
civilization
and
the
gospel
numerous
as
were
the
statutory
regulations
for
the
treatment
of
the
servant
they
could
not
preclude
the
large
discretion
of
the
master
the
apprentice
in
our
country
is
subjected
to
an
authority
equaling
a
parent
authority
but
not
always
tempered
in
its
exercise
with
a
parent
love
his
condition
is
therefore
not
unfrequently
marked
with
severity
and
suffering
now
imagine
what
this
condition
would
be
under
the
harsh
features
of
a
more
barbarous
age
and
you
will
have
in
it
as
i
conjecture
no
distant
resemblance
to
that
of
some
of
the
jewish
servants
but
how
different
is
this
condition
from
that
of
the
slave
i
am
reminded
in
this
connexion
of
the
polished
but
pernicious
article
on
slavery
in
a
late
number
of
the
biblical
repertory
in
that
article
professor
hodge
says
that
the
claim
of
the
slaveholder
is
found
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
transferable
claim
of
service
either
for
life
or
for
a
term
of
years
will
he
allow
me
to
ask
him
where
he
discovered
that
the
pretensions
of
the
slaveholder
are
all
resolvable
into
this
modest
claim
he
certainly
did
not
discover
it
in
any
slave
code
nor
in
any
practical
slavery
where
then
no
where
but
in
that
undisclosed
system
of
servitude
which
is
the
creation
of
his
own
fancy
to
this
system
i
raise
no
objection
whatever
on
the
contrary
i
am
willing
to
admit
its
beauty
and
its
worthiness
of
the
mint
in
which
it
was
coined
but
i
protest
against
his
right
to
bestow
upon
it
the
name
of
another
and
totally
different
thing
he
must
not
call
it
slavery
suppose
a
poor
german
to
be
so
desirous
of
emigrating
with
his
family
to
america
as
to
agree
to
give
his
services
for
ten
years
as
a
compensation
for
the
passage
suppose
further
that
the
services
are
to
be
rendered
to
the
captain
of
the
ship
in
which
they
sail
or
to
any
other
person
to
whom
he
may
assign
his
claim
such
a
bargain
is
not
uncommon
now
according
to
professor
hodge
this
german
may
as
rightly
as
any
of
your
southern
servants
be
called
a
slave
he
may
as
rightly
be
called
as
they
may
be
who
in
the
language
of
the
south
carolina
laws
shall
be
deemed
held
taken
reputed
and
adjudged
in
law
to
be
chattels
personal
in
the
hands
of
their
owners
and
possessors
and
their
executors
administrators
and
assigns
all
intents
constructions
and
purposes
we
will
glance
at
a
few
points
of
difference
in
their
condition
the
german
is
capable
of
making
a
contract
and
in
the
case
supposed
does
make
a
contract
but
your
slave
is
incapable
of
making
any
contract
the
german
receives
wages
the
price
of
carrying
himself
and
family
being
the
stipulated
price
for
his
services
during
the
ten
years
but
your
slave
receives
no
wages
the
german
like
any
other
hireling
and
like
any
apprentice
in
our
country
is
under
the
protection
of
law
but
there
is
no
law
to
shield
the
slave
from
wrongs
being
a
mere
chattel
or
thing
he
has
no
rights
and
therefore
he
can
have
no
wrongs
to
be
redressed
does
professor
hodge
say
that
there
are
statutes
limiting
and
regulating
the
power
of
the
slaveholder
i
grant
there
are
though
it
must
be
remembered
that
there
is
one
way
of
even
murdering
a
slave
which
some
of
the
slave
states
do
not
only
not
forbid
but
impliedly
and
practically
admit
a
the
professor
should
know
however
that
all
these
statutes
are
practically
a
mere
nullity
nevertheless
they
show
the
absoluteness
of
the
power
which
they
nominally
qualify
this
absoluteness
is
as
distinctly
implied
by
them
as
the
like
was
by
the
law
of
the
emperor
claudius
which
imposed
limitations
upon
the
jus
vitae
et
necis
the
right
of
life
and
death
which
roman
slavery
put
into
the
hand
of
the
master
but
if
the
professor
should
be
so
imprudent
as
to
cite
us
to
the
slave
code
for
evidence
of
its
merciful
provisions
he
will
in
so
doing
authorize
us
to
cite
him
to
that
code
for
evidence
of
the
of
slavery
this
authority
however
he
would
not
like
to
give
us
for
he
is
unwilling
to
have
slavery
judged
of
by
its
own
code
he
insists
that
it
shall
be
judged
of
by
that
ideal
system
of
slavery
which
is
lodged
in
his
own
brain
and
which
he
can
bring
forth
by
parcels
to
suit
present
occasions
as
mahomet
produced
the
leaves
of
the
koran
footnote
a
the
licensed
murder
referred
to
is
that
where
the
slave
dies
under
moderate
correction
but
is
not
the
murder
of
a
slave
by
a
white
man
any
practically
licensed
in
all
the
slave
states
who
ever
heard
of
a
white
man
being
put
to
death
under
southern
laws
for
the
murder
of
a
slave
american
slavery
provides
impunity
for
the
white
murderer
of
the
slave
by
its
allowing
none
but
whites
none
but
those
who
construct
and
uphold
the
system
of
abominations
to
testify
against
the
murderer
but
why
particularize
causes
of
this
impunity
the
whole
policy
of
the
southern
slave
system
goes
to
provide
it
how
unreasonable
is
it
to
suppose
that
they
who
have
conspired
against
a
portion
of
their
and
mutually
pledged
themselves
to
treat
them
as
how
unreasonable
i
say
is
it
to
suppose
that
they
would
consent
to
put
a
to
death
on
account
of
his
treatment
in
whatever
way
of
a
not
long
ago
i
was
informed
by
a
highly
respectable
lawyer
of
the
state
of
georgia
that
he
had
known
a
number
of
attempts
attempts
most
probably
but
in
form
and
name
to
effect
the
conviction
of
whites
for
their
undoubted
murder
of
slaves
but
in
every
instance
the
jurors
perjured
themselves
rather
than
consent
that
a
should
be
put
to
death
for
the
liberty
he
had
taken
in
disposing
of
a
they
had
rather
perjure
themselves
than
by
avenging
the
blood
of
a
with
that
of
a
make
a
breach
upon
the
policy
of
keeping
the
slave
ignorant
that
he
has
the
and
consequently
the
of
a
man
professor
hodge
tells
his
readers
in
substance
that
the
selling
of
men
as
they
are
sold
under
the
system
of
slavery
is
to
be
classed
with
the
cessions
of
territory
occasionally
made
by
one
sovereign
to
another
and
he
would
have
the
slave
who
is
sold
from
hand
to
hand
and
from
state
to
state
at
the
expense
to
his
bleeding
heart
of
the
disruption
of
its
dearest
ties
think
his
lot
no
harder
than
that
of
the
inhabitant
of
louisiana
who
was
passed
without
his
will
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
french
government
to
that
of
the
united
states
when
a
good
man
lends
himself
to
the
advocacy
of
slavery
he
must
at
least
for
a
time
feel
himself
to
be
anywhere
but
at
home
amongst
his
new
thoughts
doctrines
and
modes
of
reasoning
this
is
very
evident
in
the
case
before
us
especially
when
now
and
then
old
habits
of
thought
and
feeling
break
out
in
spite
of
every
effort
to
repress
them
and
the
professor
is
himself
again
and
discourses
as
manfully
as
fearlessly
and
as
eloquently
as
he
ever
had
done
before
the
slaveholders
got
their
hands
upon
him
it
is
not
a
little
amusing
to
notice
that
although
the
burden
of
his
article
is
to
show
that
slavery
is
one
of
institutions
what
an
undertaking
for
a
professor
of
theology
in
the
year
he
so
far
forgets
the
interests
of
his
new
friends
and
their
expectations
from
him
as
to
admit
on
one
page
that
the
general
principles
of
the
gospel
have
destroyed
domestic
slavery
throughout
the
greater
part
of
christendom
and
on
another
that
the
south
has
to
choose
between
emancipation
by
the
silent
and
holy
influence
of
the
gospel
or
to
abide
the
issue
of
a
long
continued
conflict
against
the
laws
of
god
whoever
heard
until
these
strange
times
on
which
we
have
fallen
of
any
thing
which
to
use
the
professor
language
about
slavery
it
is
in
vain
to
contend
is
sin
and
yet
profess
reverence
for
the
scriptures
being
at
war
with
and
destroyed
by
the
principles
of
the
gospel
what
sad
confusion
of
thought
the
influences
to
which
some
great
divines
have
yielded
have
wrought
in
them
i
will
proceed
to
argue
that
the
institution
in
the
southern
states
called
slavery
is
radically
unlike
any
form
of
servitude
under
which
jews
were
held
agreeably
to
the
divine
will
and
also
radically
unlike
any
form
of
servitude
approved
of
god
in
the
patriarchal
families
god
does
not
contradict
himself
he
is
without
variableness
or
shadow
of
turning
he
loves
his
word
and
has
magnified
it
above
all
his
name
he
commands
his
rational
creatures
to
search
the
scriptures
he
can
not
therefore
approve
of
a
system
which
forbids
the
searching
of
them
and
shuts
out
their
light
from
the
soul
and
which
by
the
confession
of
your
own
selves
turns
men
in
this
gospel
land
into
heathen
he
has
written
his
commandment
against
adultery
and
he
can
not
therefore
approve
of
a
system
which
induces
this
crime
by
forbidding
marriage
the
following
extract
from
an
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
of
maryland
shows
some
of
the
consequences
of
this
forbidding
to
marry
a
slave
has
never
maintained
an
action
against
the
violator
of
his
bed
a
slave
is
not
admonished
for
incontinence
or
punished
for
fornication
or
adultery
never
prosecuted
for
bigamy
again
god
has
written
his
commandment
that
children
should
honor
their
parents
how
then
can
he
approve
of
a
system
which
pours
contempt
on
the
relation
of
parent
and
child
which
subjects
them
to
be
forcibly
separated
from
each
other
and
that
too
beyond
the
hope
of
reunion
under
which
parents
are
exposed
and
sold
in
the
along
with
horses
and
cattle
under
which
they
are
stripped
and
lashed
and
made
to
suffer
those
innumerable
and
some
of
them
nameless
indignities
that
tend
to
generate
in
their
children
who
witness
them
any
feelings
rather
than
those
of
respect
and
honor
for
parents
thus
degraded
some
of
these
nameless
indignities
are
alluded
to
in
a
letter
written
to
me
from
a
slave
state
in
march
in
this
place
says
the
writer
i
find
a
regular
and
a
much
frequented
slave
market
where
thousands
are
yearly
sold
like
cattle
to
the
highest
bidder
it
is
the
opinion
of
gentlemen
here
that
not
far
from
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
are
yearly
paid
in
this
place
for
negroes
and
at
this
moment
i
can
look
from
the
window
of
my
room
and
count
six
droves
of
from
twenty
to
forty
each
sitting
in
the
market
place
for
sale
this
morning
i
witnessed
the
sale
of
twelve
slaves
and
i
could
but
shudder
at
the
language
used
and
the
liberties
taken
with
the
females
as
a
proof
that
in
the
kinds
of
servitude
referred
to
god
did
not
invest
abraham
or
any
other
person
with
that
absolute
ownership
of
his
which
is
claimed
by
southern
slaveholders
i
would
remark
that
he
has
made
man
accountable
to
himself
but
slavery
makes
him
accountable
to
and
a
mere
appendage
to
his
slavery
substitutes
the
will
of
a
fallible
for
that
infallible
rule
of
action
the
will
of
god
the
slave
instead
of
being
allowed
to
make
it
the
great
end
of
his
existence
to
glorify
god
and
enjoy
him
for
ever
is
degraded
from
his
exalted
nature
which
borders
upon
angelic
dignity
to
be
to
do
and
to
suffer
what
a
mere
man
bids
him
be
do
and
suffer
the
southern
slave
would
obey
god
in
respect
to
marriage
and
also
to
the
reading
and
studying
of
his
word
but
this
as
we
have
seen
is
forbidden
him
he
may
not
marry
nor
may
he
read
the
bible
again
he
would
obey
god
in
the
duties
of
secret
and
social
prayer
but
he
may
not
attend
the
certainly
not
that
of
his
choice
and
instances
are
known
where
the
master
has
intruded
upon
the
secret
audience
with
heaven
to
teach
him
by
the
lash
or
some
other
instrument
of
torture
that
he
would
allow
no
other
god
before
himself
said
joseph
mason
an
intelligent
colored
man
who
was
born
and
bred
near
richmond
in
virginia
in
reply
to
my
question
whether
he
and
his
cared
about
their
souls
we
did
not
trouble
ourselves
about
our
souls
we
were
our
masters
property
and
not
our
own
under
their
and
not
our
own
control
and
we
believed
that
our
masters
were
responsible
for
our
souls
this
unconcern
for
their
spiritual
interests
grew
very
naturally
out
of
their
relation
to
their
masters
and
were
the
relation
ordained
of
god
the
unconcern
would
surely
be
both
philosophical
and
sinless
god
can
not
approve
of
a
system
of
servitude
in
which
the
master
is
guilty
of
assuming
absolute
power
of
assuming
god
place
and
relation
towards
his
were
the
master
in
every
case
a
wise
and
good
man
as
wise
and
good
as
is
consistent
with
this
wicked
and
assumption
on
his
part
the
condition
of
the
slave
would
it
is
true
be
far
more
tolerable
than
it
now
is
but
even
then
we
should
protest
as
strongly
as
ever
against
slavery
for
it
would
still
be
guilty
of
its
essential
wickedness
of
robbing
a
man
of
his
right
to
himself
and
of
robbing
god
of
his
right
to
him
and
of
putting
these
stolen
rights
into
the
hand
of
an
erring
mortal
nay
if
angels
were
constituted
slaveholders
our
objection
to
the
relation
would
remain
undiminished
since
there
would
still
be
the
same
robbery
of
which
we
now
complain
but
you
will
say
that
i
have
overlooked
the
servitude
in
which
the
jews
held
strangers
and
foreigners
and
that
it
is
on
this
more
than
any
other
that
you
rely
for
your
justification
of
slavery
i
will
say
nothing
now
of
this
servitude
but
before
i
close
this
communication
i
will
give
my
reasons
for
believing
that
whatever
was
its
nature
even
if
it
were
compulsory
it
can
not
be
fairly
pleaded
in
justification
of
slavery
after
you
shall
have
allowed
as
you
will
allow
that
slavery
as
it
exists
is
at
war
with
god
you
will
be
likely
to
say
that
the
fault
is
not
in
the
theory
of
it
but
in
the
practical
departure
from
that
theory
that
it
is
not
the
system
but
the
practice
under
it
which
is
at
war
with
god
our
concern
however
is
with
slavery
as
it
is
and
not
with
any
theory
of
it
but
to
indulge
you
we
will
look
at
the
system
of
slavery
as
it
is
presented
to
us
in
the
laws
of
the
slave
states
and
what
do
we
find
here
why
that
the
system
is
as
bad
as
the
practice
under
it
here
we
find
the
most
diabolical
devices
to
keep
millions
of
human
beings
in
a
state
of
heathenism
in
the
deepest
ignorance
and
most
loathsome
pollution
but
you
will
tell
me
that
i
do
not
look
far
enough
to
find
the
true
theory
of
slavery
and
that
the
cruelties
and
abominations
which
the
laws
of
the
slave
states
have
ingrafted
on
this
theory
are
not
acknowledged
by
the
good
men
in
those
states
to
be
a
part
of
the
theory
well
you
shall
have
the
benefit
of
this
plea
and
i
admit
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
this
theory
of
slavery
which
lies
far
back
and
out
of
sight
of
every
thing
visible
and
known
about
slavery
is
right
and
what
does
this
admission
avail
you
it
is
slavery
as
it
is
as
it
is
seen
and
known
that
the
abolitionists
are
contending
against
but
say
you
to
induce
our
forbearance
we
good
men
at
the
south
are
restoring
slavery
as
fast
as
we
can
to
what
it
should
be
and
we
will
soon
make
its
erring
practice
quadrate
with
its
perfect
and
sinless
theory
success
to
your
endeavors
but
let
me
ask
these
good
men
whether
similar
representations
would
avail
to
make
them
forbearing
towards
any
other
class
of
offenders
and
whether
they
would
allow
these
offenders
to
justify
the
wickedness
of
their
hands
by
pleading
the
purity
of
their
hearts
suppose
that
i
stand
in
court
confessedly
guilty
of
the
crime
of
passing
counterfeit
money
and
that
i
ask
for
my
acquittal
on
the
ground
that
notwithstanding
i
am
practically
wrong
i
am
nevertheless
theoretically
right
believe
me
i
say
in
tones
of
deep
and
unfeigned
pathos
and
with
a
corresponding
pressure
of
my
hand
upon
my
heart
that
the
principles
within
are
those
of
the
purest
morality
and
that
it
is
my
faithful
endeavor
to
bring
my
deportment
which
as
you
this
day
witness
is
occasionally
devious
into
perfect
conformity
with
my
inward
rectitude
my
theory
of
honest
and
holy
living
is
all
that
you
could
wish
it
to
be
be
but
patient
and
you
shall
witness
its
beautiful
exhibitions
in
my
whole
conduct
now
you
certainly
would
not
have
this
plea
turn
to
my
advantage
why
then
expect
that
your
similar
plea
should
be
allowed
we
must
continue
to
judge
of
slavery
by
what
it
is
and
not
by
what
you
tell
us
it
will
or
may
be
until
its
character
be
righteous
we
shall
continue
to
condemn
it
but
when
you
shall
have
brought
it
back
to
your
sinless
and
beautiful
theory
of
it
it
will
have
nothing
to
fear
from
the
abolitionists
there
are
two
prominent
reasons
however
for
believing
that
you
will
never
present
southern
slavery
to
us
in
this
lovely
character
the
mere
imagination
of
which
is
so
dear
to
you
the
first
is
that
you
are
doing
nothing
to
this
end
it
is
an
indisputable
fact
that
southern
slavery
is
continually
getting
wider
and
wider
from
god
and
from
an
innocent
theory
of
servitude
and
the
good
men
at
the
south
of
whom
we
have
spoken
are
not
only
doing
nothing
to
arrest
this
increasing
divergency
but
they
are
actually
favoring
it
the
writings
of
your
dews
and
baxters
and
plummers
and
postells
and
andersons
and
the
proceedings
of
your
ecclesiastical
bodies
abundantly
show
this
never
and
the
assertion
is
borne
out
by
your
statute
books
as
well
as
other
evidences
has
southern
slavery
multiplied
its
abominations
so
rapidly
as
within
the
last
ten
years
and
never
before
had
the
southern
church
been
so
much
engaged
to
defend
and
perpetuate
these
abominations
the
other
of
these
reasons
for
believing
that
southern
slavery
will
never
be
conformed
to
your
of
slavery
in
which
it
is
presupposed
there
are
none
but
principles
of
righteousness
is
that
on
its
first
contact
with
these
principles
it
would
vanish
into
thin
air
leaving
not
a
wreck
behind
in
proof
of
this
and
i
need
not
cite
any
other
case
it
would
be
immediate
death
to
southern
slavery
to
concede
to
its
subjects
god
institution
of
marriage
and
hence
it
is
that
its
code
forbids
marriage
the
rights
of
the
husband
in
the
wife
and
of
the
wife
in
the
husband
and
of
parents
in
their
children
would
stand
directly
in
the
way
of
that
traffic
in
human
flesh
which
is
the
very
of
slavery
and
the
assumptions
of
the
master
would
at
every
turn
and
corner
be
met
and
nullified
by
these
rights
since
all
his
commands
to
the
children
of
those
servants
for
now
they
should
no
longer
be
called
slaves
would
be
in
submission
to
the
paramount
authority
of
the
parents
a
and
here
sir
you
and
i
might
bring
our
discussion
to
a
close
by
my
putting
the
following
questions
to
you
both
of
which
your
conscience
would
compel
you
to
answer
in
the
affirmative
footnote
a
i
am
aware
that
professor
hodge
asserts
that
slavery
may
exist
without
those
laws
which
interfere
with
their
the
slaves
marital
or
parental
right
now
this
is
a
point
of
immense
importance
in
the
discussion
of
the
question
whether
slavery
is
sinful
and
i
therefore
respectfully
ask
him
either
to
retract
the
assertion
or
to
prove
its
correctness
ten
thousands
of
his
to
whom
the
assertion
is
utterly
incredible
unite
with
me
in
this
request
if
he
can
show
that
slavery
does
not
interfere
with
marital
or
parental
rights
they
will
cease
to
oppose
it
their
confident
belief
is
that
slavery
and
marriage
whether
considered
in
the
light
of
a
civil
contract
or
a
scriptural
institution
are
entirely
incompatible
with
each
other
is
not
southern
slavery
guilty
of
a
most
crime
in
substituting
concubinage
for
god
institution
of
marriage
would
not
that
slavery
and
also
every
theory
and
modification
of
slavery
for
which
you
may
contend
come
speedily
to
nought
if
their
subjects
were
allowed
to
marry
slavery
being
an
abuse
is
incapable
of
reformation
it
dies
not
only
when
you
aim
a
fatal
blow
at
its
life
principle
its
foundation
doctrine
of
man
right
to
property
in
man
b
but
it
dies
as
surely
when
you
prune
it
of
its
manifold
incidents
of
pollution
and
irreligion
footnote
b
i
mean
by
this
phrase
right
to
property
in
man
a
right
to
hold
man
as
property
and
i
do
not
see
with
what
propriety
certain
writers
construe
it
to
mean
a
property
in
the
mere
services
of
a
man
but
it
would
be
treating
you
indecorously
to
stop
you
at
this
stage
of
the
discussion
before
we
are
a
third
of
the
way
through
your
book
and
thus
deny
a
hearing
to
the
remainder
of
it
we
will
proceed
to
what
you
say
of
the
slavery
which
existed
in
the
time
of
the
new
testament
writers
before
we
do
so
however
let
me
call
your
attention
to
a
few
of
the
specimens
of
very
careless
reasoning
in
that
part
of
your
book
which
we
have
now
gone
over
they
may
serve
to
inspire
you
with
a
modest
distrust
of
the
soundness
of
other
parts
of
your
argument
after
concluding
that
abraham
was
a
slaveholder
you
quote
the
following
language
from
the
bible
abraham
obeyed
my
voice
and
kept
my
charge
my
commandments
my
statutes
and
my
laws
you
then
inquire
how
could
this
be
true
of
abraham
holding
as
he
did
until
he
was
an
old
man
more
slaves
than
any
man
in
mississippi
or
louisiana
to
be
consistent
with
your
design
in
quoting
this
passage
you
must
argue
from
it
that
abraham
was
perfect
but
this
he
was
not
and
therefore
your
quotation
is
vain
again
if
the
slaveholder
would
quiet
his
conscience
with
the
supposition
that
abraham
held
more
slaves
than
any
man
in
mississippi
or
louisiana
let
him
remember
that
he
had
also
more
concubines
than
any
man
in
mississippi
or
louisiana
and
if
authority
be
in
the
one
case
conclusive
for
slaveholding
equally
so
must
it
be
in
the
other
for
concubinage
perhaps
in
saying
that
abraham
had
more
concubines
than
any
man
in
mississippi
or
louisiana
i
have
done
injustice
to
the
spirit
of
propagation
prevailing
amongst
the
gentlemen
of
those
states
it
may
be
that
some
of
your
planters
quite
distance
the
old
patriarch
in
obedience
to
the
command
to
multiply
and
replenish
the
earth
i
am
correctly
informed
that
a
planter
in
virginia
who
counted
i
know
not
how
many
slaves
upon
his
plantation
confessed
on
his
that
his
licentiousness
had
extended
to
every
adult
female
amongst
them
this
planter
was
a
near
relative
of
the
celebrated
patrick
henry
it
may
be
that
you
have
planters
in
mississippi
and
louisiana
who
avail
themselves
to
the
extent
that
he
did
of
the
power
which
slaveholding
gives
to
pollute
and
destroy
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
mulattoes
who
constitute
the
southern
commentary
on
the
charge
that
the
abolitionists
design
amalgamation
bear
witness
that
this
planter
was
not
singular
in
his
propensities
i
do
not
know
what
you
can
do
with
this
species
of
your
population
besides
that
it
is
a
standing
and
deep
reproach
on
southern
chastity
it
is
not
a
little
embarrassing
and
puzzling
to
those
who
have
received
the
doctrine
that
the
descendants
of
africa
amongst
us
must
be
returned
to
the
land
of
their
ancestors
how
the
poor
mulatto
shall
be
disposed
of
under
this
doctrine
between
the
call
which
africa
makes
for
him
on
the
one
hand
and
that
which
some
state
of
europe
sends
out
for
him
on
the
other
is
a
problem
more
difficult
of
solution
than
that
which
the
contending
mothers
brought
before
the
matchless
wisdom
of
solomon
in
the
paragraph
which
relates
to
the
fourth
and
tenth
commandments
there
is
another
specimen
of
your
loose
reasoning
you
say
that
the
language
in
it
the
sabbath
thou
shalt
do
no
work
thou
nor
thy
son
nor
thy
daughter
nor
thy
man
servant
nor
thy
maid
servant
recognises
the
authority
of
the
master
over
the
servant
i
grant
that
it
does
but
does
it
at
all
show
that
these
servants
were
slaves
does
it
recognise
any
more
authority
than
the
master
should
exercise
over
his
voluntary
servants
should
not
the
head
of
a
family
restrain
all
his
servants
as
well
the
voluntary
as
the
involuntary
from
unnecessary
labor
on
the
sabbath
you
also
say
that
the
tenth
commandment
recognizes
servants
as
the
of
their
masters
but
how
does
it
appear
from
the
language
of
this
commandment
that
the
man
servant
and
maid
servant
are
property
any
more
than
the
wife
is
we
will
proceed
however
to
the
third
section
of
your
book
your
acquaintance
with
history
has
enabled
you
to
show
some
of
the
characteristics
and
fruits
of
greek
and
roman
slavery
you
state
the
facts
that
the
subjects
of
this
slavery
were
absolutely
the
property
of
their
masters
that
they
were
used
like
dogs
that
they
were
forbidden
to
learn
any
liberal
art
or
perform
any
act
worthy
of
their
masters
that
once
a
day
they
received
a
certain
number
of
stripes
for
fear
they
should
forget
they
were
slaves
that
at
one
time
sixty
thousand
of
them
in
sicily
and
italy
were
chained
and
confined
to
work
in
dungeons
that
in
rome
there
was
a
continual
market
for
slaves
and
that
the
slaves
were
commonly
exposed
for
sale
naked
that
when
old
they
were
turned
away
and
that
too
by
a
master
highly
esteemed
for
his
superior
virtues
to
starve
to
death
that
they
were
thrown
into
ponds
to
be
food
for
fish
that
they
were
in
the
city
of
athens
near
twenty
times
as
numerous
as
free
persons
that
there
were
in
the
roman
empire
sixty
millions
of
slaves
to
twenty
millions
of
freemen
mind
that
many
of
the
romans
had
five
thousand
some
ten
thousand
and
others
twenty
thousand
and
now
for
what
purpose
is
your
recital
of
these
facts
not
for
its
natural
effect
of
awakening
in
your
readers
the
utmost
abhorrence
of
slavery
no
but
for
the
strange
purpose
the
more
strange
for
being
in
the
breast
of
a
minister
of
the
gospel
of
showing
your
readers
that
even
greek
and
roman
slavery
was
innocent
and
agreeable
to
god
will
and
that
horrid
as
are
the
fruits
you
describe
the
tree
which
bore
them
needed
but
to
be
dug
about
and
pruned
not
to
be
cut
down
this
slavery
is
innocent
you
insist
because
the
new
testament
does
not
show
that
it
was
specifically
condemned
by
the
apostles
by
the
same
logic
the
races
the
games
the
dramatic
entertainments
and
the
shows
of
gladiators
which
abounded
in
greece
and
rome
were
likewise
innocent
because
the
new
testament
does
not
show
a
specific
condemnation
of
them
by
the
apostles
a
but
although
the
new
testament
does
not
show
such
condemnation
does
it
necessarily
follow
that
they
were
silent
in
relation
to
these
sins
or
because
the
new
testament
does
not
specifically
condemn
greek
and
roman
slavery
may
we
therefore
infer
that
the
apostles
did
not
specifically
condemn
it
look
through
the
published
writings
of
many
of
the
eminent
divines
who
have
lived
in
modern
times
and
have
written
and
published
much
for
the
instruction
of
the
churches
and
you
will
not
find
a
line
in
them
against
gambling
or
theatres
or
the
in
some
of
them
not
a
line
against
the
very
common
sin
of
drunkenness
think
you
therefore
that
they
never
spoke
or
wrote
against
these
things
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
expect
to
find
in
print
their
sentiments
against
all
even
of
the
crying
sins
of
their
times
but
how
much
more
unreasonable
is
it
to
expect
to
find
in
the
few
pages
of
the
apostles
published
letters
the
whole
of
which
can
be
read
in
a
few
hours
their
sentiments
in
relation
to
all
the
prominent
sins
of
the
age
in
which
they
lived
and
far
greater
still
is
the
unreasonableness
of
setting
them
down
as
favorable
to
all
practices
which
these
letters
do
not
specifically
condemn
footnote
a
hodge
says
if
the
apostles
did
abstain
from
declaring
slavery
to
be
sinful
it
must
have
been
because
they
did
not
consider
it
as
in
itself
a
crime
no
other
solution
of
their
conduct
is
consistent
with
their
truth
or
fidelity
but
he
believes
that
they
did
abstain
from
so
doing
and
he
believes
this
on
the
same
evidence
on
which
he
believes
that
they
abstained
from
declaring
the
races
games
above
enumerated
to
be
sinful
his
own
mode
of
reasoning
therefore
brings
him
unavoidably
to
the
conclusion
that
these
races
games
were
not
sinful
it
may
be
that
the
saviour
and
the
apostles
in
the
course
of
their
teachings
both
oral
and
written
did
specify
sins
to
a
far
greater
extent
than
they
are
supposed
to
have
done
it
may
be
that
their
followers
had
much
instruction
in
respect
to
the
great
sin
of
slavery
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
but
a
very
small
part
of
that
divine
instruction
which
on
the
testimony
of
an
apostle
the
world
itself
could
not
contain
if
written
has
come
down
to
us
of
the
writings
of
our
saviour
we
have
nothing
of
those
of
his
apostles
a
very
small
part
it
is
probable
that
during
his
protracted
ministry
the
learned
apostle
to
the
gentiles
wrote
many
letters
on
religious
subjects
to
individuals
and
to
churches
so
also
of
the
immense
amount
of
instruction
which
fell
from
the
lips
of
the
apostles
but
very
little
is
preserved
it
was
infinite
wisdom
however
which
determined
the
size
of
the
new
as
well
as
of
the
old
testament
and
of
what
kinds
and
portions
of
the
saviour
and
the
apostles
instructions
it
should
consist
for
obvious
considerations
it
is
made
up
in
a
great
measure
of
general
truths
and
propositions
its
limited
size
if
no
other
reason
accounts
for
this
but
these
general
truths
and
propositions
are
as
comprehensive
as
the
necessity
of
the
case
requires
and
carried
out
into
all
their
suitable
applications
they
leave
no
sin
unforbidden
small
as
is
the
new
testament
it
is
as
large
as
we
need
it
instructs
us
in
relation
to
all
our
duties
it
is
as
full
on
the
subject
of
slavery
as
is
necessary
and
if
we
will
but
obey
its
directions
that
bear
on
this
subject
and
love
one
another
and
love
our
neighbors
as
ourselves
and
as
we
would
that
men
should
do
to
us
do
also
to
them
likewise
and
remember
them
that
are
in
bonds
as
bound
with
them
and
give
unto
servants
that
which
is
just
and
equal
not
a
vestige
of
this
abomination
will
remain
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
i
will
admit
that
the
apostles
made
no
specific
attack
on
slavery
a
and
that
they
left
it
to
be
reached
and
overthrown
provided
it
be
sinful
by
the
general
principles
and
instructions
which
they
had
inculcated
but
you
will
say
that
it
was
their
practice
in
addition
to
inculcating
such
principles
and
instructions
to
point
out
sins
and
reprove
them
and
you
will
ask
with
great
pertinence
and
force
why
they
did
not
also
point
out
and
reprove
slavery
which
in
the
judgment
of
abolitionists
is
to
be
classed
with
the
most
heinous
sins
i
admit
that
there
is
no
question
addressed
to
abolitionists
which
after
the
admission
i
have
made
for
them
it
is
less
easy
to
answer
and
i
admit
further
that
they
are
bound
to
answer
it
i
will
proceed
to
assign
what
to
me
appear
to
be
some
of
the
probable
reasons
why
the
apostles
specified
the
sins
of
lying
covetousness
stealing
and
agreeably
to
the
admission
which
lays
me
under
great
disadvantage
did
not
specify
slavery
footnote
a
this
is
no
small
admission
in
the
face
of
the
passage
in
the
first
chapter
of
timothy
which
particularizes
manstealing
as
a
violation
of
the
law
of
god
i
believe
all
scholars
will
admit
that
one
of
the
crimes
referred
to
by
the
apostle
is
kidnapping
but
is
not
kidnapping
an
integral
and
most
vital
part
of
the
system
of
slavery
and
is
not
the
slaveholder
guilty
of
this
crime
does
he
not
indeed
belong
to
a
class
of
kidnappers
stamped
with
peculiar
meanness
the
pirate
on
the
coast
of
africa
has
to
cope
with
the
strength
and
adroitness
of
mature
years
to
get
his
victim
into
his
clutches
is
a
deed
of
daring
and
of
peril
demanding
no
little
praise
upon
the
principles
of
the
world
code
of
honor
but
the
proud
chivalry
of
the
south
is
securely
employed
in
kidnapping
newborn
infants
the
pirate
in
the
one
case
soothes
his
conscience
with
the
thought
that
the
bloody
savages
merit
no
better
treatment
than
they
are
receiving
at
his
hands
but
the
pirate
in
the
other
can
have
no
such
plea
for
they
whom
he
kidnaps
are
untainted
with
crime
and
what
better
does
it
make
the
case
for
you
if
we
adopt
the
translation
of
men
stealers
far
better
you
will
say
for
on
the
authority
of
othello
himself
he
that
is
robb
let
him
not
know
it
and
he
not
robbed
at
all
but
your
authority
is
not
conclusive
the
crime
of
the
depredation
is
none
the
less
because
the
subject
is
ignorant
or
unconscious
of
it
it
is
true
the
slave
who
never
possessed
liberty
who
was
kidnapped
at
his
birth
may
not
grieve
under
the
absence
of
it
as
he
does
from
whose
actual
and
conscious
possession
it
had
been
violently
taken
but
the
robbery
is
alike
plain
and
is
coupled
with
a
meanness
in
the
one
case
which
does
not
disgrace
it
in
the
the
book
of
acts
sets
forth
the
fundamental
doctrines
and
requirements
of
christianity
it
is
to
the
letters
of
the
apostles
we
are
to
look
for
extended
specifications
of
right
and
wrong
affections
and
right
and
wrong
practices
why
do
these
letters
omit
to
specify
the
sin
of
slaveholding
because
they
were
addressed
to
professing
christians
exclusively
who
far
more
emphatically
then
than
now
were
the
base
things
of
the
world
and
were
in
circumstances
to
be
slaves
rather
than
slaveholders
doubtless
there
were
many
slaves
amongst
them
but
i
can
not
admit
that
there
were
slaveholders
there
is
not
the
least
probability
that
slaveholding
was
a
prevalent
sin
amongst
primitive
christians
b
instructions
to
them
on
that
sin
might
have
been
almost
as
superfluous
as
would
be
lectures
on
the
sin
of
luxury
addressed
to
the
poor
greenland
disciples
whose
poverty
compels
them
to
subsist
on
filthy
oil
no
one
acquainted
with
the
history
of
their
lives
believes
that
the
apostles
were
they
labored
working
with
their
own
hands
the
supposition
that
they
were
slaveholders
is
inconsistent
with
their
practice
and
with
the
tenor
of
their
instructions
to
others
on
the
duty
of
manual
labor
but
if
the
apostles
were
not
slaveholders
why
may
we
suppose
that
their
disciples
were
at
the
south
it
is
like
people
like
priest
in
this
matter
there
the
minister
of
the
gospel
thinks
that
he
has
as
good
right
to
hold
slaves
as
has
his
parishioner
and
your
methodists
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
even
a
bishop
has
as
good
right
as
any
other
person
to
have
slaves

how
strongly
does
the
following
extract
from
the
writings
of
the
great
and
good
augustine
who
lived
in
the
fourth
century
argue
that
slaveholding
was
not

christians

has
commanded
to
love
his
enemies
should
love
his

to

and
tremble
when

indeed
they
already
threaten
to
separate
from
their
northern
brethren
unless
this
right
be
conceded
but
have
we
not
other
and
conclusive
evidence
that
primitive
christians
were
not
slaveholders
we
will
cite
a
few
passages
from
the
bible
to
show
that
it
was
not
the
will
of
the
apostles
to
have
their
disciples
hold
manual
labor
in
disrepute
as
it
is
held
in
all
slaveholding
communities
do
your
own
business
and
work
with
your
own
hands
as
we
commanded
you
for
this
we
commanded
you
that
if
any
would
not
work
neither
should
he
eat
let
him
that
stole
steal
no
more
but
rather
let
him
labor
working
with
his
hands
the
thing
which
is
good
that
he
may
have
to
give
to
him
that
needeth
in
bringing
the
whole
verse
into
this
last
quotation
i
may
have
displeased
you
i
am
aware
that
you
slaveholders
proudly
and
indignantly
reject
the
applicableness
to
yourselves
of
the
first
phrase
in
this
verse
and
also
of
the
maxim
that
the
partaker
of
stolen
goods
is
as
bad
as
the
thief
i
am
aware
that
you
insist
that
the
kidnapping
of
a
man
or
getting
possession
of
him
after
he
has
been
kidnapped
is
not
to
be
compared
if
indeed
it
can
be
properly
called
theft
at
all
with
the
crime
of
stealing
a
it
occurs
to
me
that
if
a
shrewd
lawyer
had
you
on
trial
for
theft
he
would
say
that
you
were
from
going
into
this
distinction
between
a
and
a
inasmuch
as
by
your
own
laws
the
slave
is
expressly
declared
to
be
a
is
expressly
into
a
he
would
say
however
competent
it
may
be
for
others
to
justify
themselves
on
the
ground
that
it
was
but
a
and
not
a
they
had
stolen
your
own
statutes
which
with
magic
celerity
convert
stolen
men
into
things
make
such
a
plea
on
your
part
utterly
inadmissible
he
would
have
you
as
fast
as
though
the
stolen
goods
in
your
hands
were
a
bushel
of
wheat
or
some
other
important
instead
of
mere
but
if
you
are
not
yet
convinced
that
primitive
christians
were
not
slaveholders
let
me
cite
another
passage
to
show
you
how
very
improbable
it
is
that
they
stood
in
this
capacity
all
that
believed
had
all
things
common
and
sold
their
possessions
and
goods
and
parted
them
to
all
men
as
every
man
had
need
now
i
do
not
say
that
all
the
primitive
believers
did
so
but
if
a
portion
of
them
did
and
met
with
the
apostles
approbation
in
it
is
it
at
all
probable
that
a
course
so
diverse
from
it
as
that
of
slaveholding
in
the
church
met
likewise
with
their
approbation
i
go
on
to
account
for
the
apostles
omission
to
specify
slavery
criminality
is
not
always
obvious
in
proportion
to
its
extent
the
sin
of
the
traffic
in
intoxicating
liquors
was
until
the
last
few
years
almost
universally
unfelt
and
unperceived
but
now
we
meet
with
men
who
though
it
was
in
all
good
conscience
that
they
were
once
engaged
in
it
would
not
resume
it
for
worlds
and
who
see
more
criminality
in
taking
money
from
a
fellow
man
in
exchange
for
the
liquor
which
intoxicates
him
than
in
simple
theft
however
it
may
be
with
others
in
this
employment
they
now
see
that
for
them
to
traffic
in
intoxicating
liquors
would
be
to
stain
themselves
with
the
twofold
crime
of
robbery
and
murder
how
is
it
that
good
men
ever
get
into
this
employment
and
under
what
influences
and
by
what
process
of
thought
do
they
come
to
the
determination
to
abandon
it
the
former
is
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
they
grow
up
have
their
education
their
moral
and
intellectual
training
in
the
midst
of
a
public
opinion
and
even
of
laws
also
which
favor
and
sanction
the
employment
the
latter
is
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
they
are
brought
in
the
merciful
providence
of
god
to
observe
and
study
and
understand
the
consequences
of
their
employment
especially
on
those
who
drink
their
liquor
the
liquor
which
they
sell
or
make
or
with
no
less
criminality
furnish
the
materials
for
making
these
consequences
they
find
to
be
evil
only
evil
and
that
continually
they
find
that
this
liquor
imparts
no
benefit
to
them
who
drink
it
but
tends
to
destroy
and
oftentimes
does
destroy
their
healths
and
lives
to
continue
therefore
in
an
employment
in
which
they
receive
their
neighbor
money
without
returning
him
an
equivalent
or
any
portion
of
an
equivalent
and
in
which
they
expose
both
his
body
and
soul
to
destruction
is
to
make
themselves
in
their
own
judgments
virtually
guilty
of
theft
and
murder
thus
it
is
in
the
case
of
a
national
war
waged
for
conquest
christians
have
taken
part
in
it
and
because
they
were
blinded
by
a
wrong
education
and
were
acting
in
the
name
of
their
country
and
under
the
impulses
of
patriotism
they
never
suspected
that
they
were
doing
the
devil
instead
of
god
service
but
when
in
the
kind
providence
of
god
one
of
these
butchers
of
their
fellow
beings
is
brought
to
pause
and
consider
his
ways
and
to
resolve
his
enormous
and
compound
sin
into
its
elements
of
wickedness
into
the
lies
theft
covetousness
adultery
murder
and
what
not
of
crime
which
enter
into
it
he
is
amazed
that
he
has
been
so
slow
of
heart
to
believe
and
abandon
the
iniquity
of
his
deeds
what
i
have
said
to
show
that
christians
even
in
enlightened
and
gospelized
lands
may
be
blind
to
the
great
wickedness
of
certain
customs
and
institutions
serves
to
introduce
the
remark
that
there
were
probably
some
customs
and
institutions
in
the
time
of
the
apostles
on
which
it
would
have
been
even
worse
than
lost
labor
for
them
to
make
direct
attacks
take
for
example
the
kind
of
war
of
which
we
have
been
speaking
if
there
are
reasons
why
the
modern
christian
can
be
insensible
to
the
sin
of
it
there
are
far
stronger
reasons
why
the
primitive
christian
could
be
if
the
light
and
instruction
which
have
been
accumulating
for
eighteen
centuries
are
scarcely
sufficient
to
convince
christians
of
its
wickedness
is
it
reasonable
to
suppose
that
at
the
commencement
of
this
long
period
they
could
have
been
successfully
taught
it
consider
that
at
that
time
the
literature
and
sentiment
of
the
world
were
wholly
on
the
side
of
war
and
especially
consider
how
emphatically
the
authority
of
civil
government
and
of
human
law
was
in
favor
of
its
rightfulness
now
to
how
great
an
extent
such
authority
covers
over
and
sanctifies
sin
may
be
inferred
from
the
fact
that
there
are
many
who
notwithstanding
they
believe
slavery
to
be
a
most
sin
yet
because
it
is
legalized
and
under
the
wing
of
civil
government
would
not
have
it
spoken
against
even
rev
miller
in
certain
resolutions
which
he
submitted
to
the
last
general
assembly
indicated
his
similar
reverence
for
human
laws
and
the
lamented
rice
distinctly
recognises
in
his
letter
to
maxwell
the
doctrine
that
the
church
is
bound
to
be
quiet
about
every
sin
which
the
civil
government
adopts
and
whitewashes
that
the
christian
spectator
should
indorse
the
doctor
sentiments
on
this
point
is
still
more
worthy
of
remark
than
that
he
should
utter
them
indeed
i
judge
from
what
you
say
on
the
and
pages
of
your
book
that
you
are
yourself
opposed
to
calling
in
question
the
morality
of
that
which
civil
government
approves
but
to
doubt
the
infallibility
of
civil
government
to
speak
against
caesar
was
manifestly
held
to
be
quite
as
presumptuous
in
the
time
of
the
apostles
as
it
is
now
another
reason
why
an
apostle
would
probably
have
deemed
it
hopeless
to
attempt
to
persuade
his
disciples
immediately
and
directly
of
the
sin
of
war
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
of
their
feeble
and
distorted
perception
of
truth
and
duty
we
whose
advantage
it
is
to
have
lived
all
our
days
in
the
light
of
the
gospel
and
whose
ancestors
from
time
immemorial
had
the
like
precious
advantage
can
hardly
conceive
how
very
feeble
and
distorted
was
that
perception
but
consider
for
a
moment
who
those
disciples
were
they
had
most
of
them
but
just
been
taken
out
of
the
gross
darkness
and
filth
of
heathenism
in
reading
accounts
which
missionaries
give
of
converted
heathen
of
such
even
as
have
for
ten
fifteen
or
twenty
years
been
reputed
to
be
pious
you
are
doubtless
often
surprised
to
find
how
grossly
erroneous
are
their
moral
perceptions
their
false
education
still
cleaves
to
them
they
are
yet
to
a
great
extent
in
the
mould
of
a
corrupted
public
opinion
and
as
far
from
having
a
clear
discernment
of
moral
truth
as
were
the
partially
unsealed
eyes
which
saw
men
as
trees
walking
the
first
letter
to
the
church
at
corinth
proves
that
the
new
principles
implanted
in
its
members
had
not
yet
purged
out
the
leaven
of
their
old
wickedness
and
that
their
conceptions
of
christian
purity
and
conduct
were
sadly
defective
as
it
was
with
the
corinthian
christians
so
was
it
to
a
great
extent
with
the
other
christians
of
that
age
now
if
the
apostles
did
not
directly
teach
the
primitive
believers
that
wars
and
theatres
and
games
and
slavery
are
sinful
it
is
because
they
thought
it
more
fit
to
exercise
their
ignorant
pupils
chiefly
in
the
mere
alphabet
and
syllables
of
christianity
acts
xv
the
construction
of
words
and
sentences
would
naturally
follow
the
rudiments
of
the
gospel
if
once
possessed
by
them
would
be
apt
to
lead
them
on
to
greater
attainments
indeed
the
love
peace
truth
and
other
elements
of
holy
living
inculcated
by
the
apostles
would
if
turned
to
all
proper
account
be
fatal
to
every
even
the
most
gigantic
system
of
wickedness
having
these
elements
in
their
minds
and
hearts
they
would
not
fail
of
condemning
the
great
and
compound
sin
of
war
whenever
they
should
be
led
to
take
it
up
examine
it
resolve
it
into
its
constituent
parts
and
lay
these
parts
for
comparison
by
the
side
of
those
elements
but
such
an
advance
was
hardly
to
be
expected
from
many
of
these
heathen
converts
during
the
brief
period
in
which
they
enjoyed
apostolic
instruction
and
it
is
but
too
probable
that
most
of
them
died
in
great
ignorance
of
the
sin
of
national
wars
converts
from
the
heathen
in
the
present
age
when
conviction
of
the
sinfulness
of
war
is
spreading
in
different
parts
of
christendom
would
be
more
likely
to
imbibe
correct
views
of
it
the
apostles
fed
with
milk
before
they
fed
with
meat
as
did
our
saviour
who
declared
i
have
yet
many
things
to
say
unto
you
but
ye
can
not
bear
them
now
in
every
community
the
foundation
principles
of
righteousness
must
be
laid
before
there
can
be
fulcrums
for
the
levers
to
be
employed
in
overthrowing
the
sins
which
prevail
in
it
you
will
doubtless
then
agree
with
me
that
it
is
not
probable
that
the
apostles
taught
their
heathen
converts
directly
and
specifically
the
sinfulness
of
war
but
slaves
in
that
age
with
the
exception
of
the
comparative
few
who
were
reduced
to
slavery
on
account
of
the
crimes
of
which
they
had
been
judicially
convicted
were
the
spoils
of
war
how
often
in
that
age
as
was
most
awfully
the
fact
on
the
final
destruction
of
jerusalem
were
the
of
the
world
glutted
by
the
captives
of
war
until
therefore
they
should
be
brought
to
see
the
sinfulness
of
war
how
could
they
see
the
sinfulness
of
so
direct
and
legitimate
a
fruit
of
it
as
slavery
and
if
the
apostles
thought
their
heathen
converts
too
weak
to
be
instructed
in
the
sinfulness
of
war
how
much
more
would
they
abstain
from
instructing
them
directly
and
specifically
in
the
sin
of
slavery
in
proceeding
with
my
reasons
why
the
apostles
did
not
extend
their
specification
of
sins
to
slavery
i
remark
that
it
is
apparent
from
the
views
we
have
taken
and
from
others
which
might
have
been
taken
that
nothing
would
have
been
gained
by
their
making
direct
and
specific
attacks
on
the
institutions
of
the
civil
governments
under
which
they
lived
indeed
much
might
have
been
lost
by
their
doing
so
weak
converts
with
still
many
remains
of
heathenism
about
them
might
in
this
wise
have
been
incurably
prejudiced
against
truths
which
by
other
modes
of
teaching
by
general
and
indirect
instructions
would
probably
have
been
lodged
in
their
minds
and
there
is
another
point
of
view
in
which
vastly
more
even
their
lives
might
have
been
lost
by
the
apostles
making
the
direct
and
specific
attacks
referred
to
i
know
that
you
ridicule
the
idea
of
their
consulting
their
personal
safety
but
what
right
have
you
to
do
so
they
did
on
many
occasions
consult
the
security
of
their
lives
they
never
perilled
them
needlessly
and
through
a
presumptuous
reliance
on
god
it
is
the
devil
who
in
a
garbled
quotation
from
the
scriptures
lays
down
in
unlimited
terms
the
proposition
that
god
will
keep
his
children
but
god
promises
them
protection
only
when
they
are
in
their
own
proper
ways
the
saviour
himself
consulted
the
safety
of
his
life
until
his
time
had
full
come
and
his
command
to
his
apostles
was
when
they
persecute
you
in
this
city
flee
ye
into
another
if
you
suppose
me
to
admit
for
a
moment
that
regard
for
the
safety
of
their
lives
ever
kept
them
from
the
way
of
their
duty
you
are
entirely
mistaken
and
if
you
continue
to
assert
in
the
face
of
my
reasoning
to
the
contrary
that
on
the
supposition
of
the
sinfulness
of
slavery
their
omission
to
make
direct
and
specific
attacks
on
it
would
have
been
a
failure
of
their
duty
then
i
can
only
regret
that
this
reasoning
has
had
no
more
influence
upon
you
i
observe
that
professor
hodge
agrees
with
you
that
if
slavery
is
sin
it
would
have
been
specifically
attacked
by
the
apostles
at
any
hazard
to
their
lives
this
is
his
conclusion
because
they
did
not
hesitate
to
specify
and
rebuke
idolatry
here
is
another
of
the
sophisms
the
fact
that
the
apostles
preached
against
idolatry
is
no
reason
at
all
why
if
slavery
is
sin
they
would
have
preached
against
that
also
on
the
one
hand
it
is
not
conceivable
that
the
gospel
can
be
preached
where
there
is
idolatry
without
attacking
it
for
in
setting
forth
the
true
god
to
idolaters
the
preacher
must
denounce
their
false
gods
on
the
other
hand
gospel
sermons
can
be
preached
without
number
and
the
true
god
presented
not
only
in
a
nation
of
idolaters
but
elsewhere
without
one
allusion
being
made
to
such
crying
sins
as
slavery
lewdness
and
intemperance
in
the
same
connexion
professor
hodge
makes
the
remark
we
do
not
expect
them
our
missionaries
to
refrain
from
denouncing
the
institutions
of
the
heathen
as
sinful
because
they
are
popular
or
intimately
interwoven
with
society
if
he
means
by
this
language
that
it
is
the
duty
of
missionaries
on
going
into
a
heathen
nation
to
array
themselves
against
the
civil
government
and
to
make
direct
and
specific
attacks
on
its
wicked
nature
and
wicked
administration
then
is
he
at
issue
on
this
point
with
the
whole
christian
public
and
if
he
does
not
mean
this
or
what
amounts
to
this
i
do
not
see
how
his
remark
will
avail
any
thing
in
his
attempt
to
show
that
the
apostles
made
such
attacks
on
whatever
sinful
institutions
came
under
their
observation
what
i
have
said
on
a
former
page
shows
sufficiently
how
fit
it
is
for
missionaries
to
the
heathen
more
especially
in
the
first
years
of
their
efforts
among
them
to
labor
to
instruct
their
ignorant
pupils
in
the
elementary
principles
of
christianity
rather
than
to
call
their
attention
to
the
institutions
of
civil
government
the
sinfulness
of
which
they
would
not
be
able
to
perceive
until
they
had
been
grounded
in
those
elementary
principles
and
the
sinfulness
of
which
more
than
of
any
thing
else
their
prejudices
would
forbid
them
to
suspect
another
reason
why
the
missionary
to
the
heathen
should
not
directly
and
certainly
not
immediately
assail
their
civil
governments
is
that
he
would
thereby
arouse
their
jealousies
to
a
pitch
fatal
to
his
influence
his
usefulness
and
most
probably
his
life
and
another
reason
is
that
this
imprudence
would
effectually
close
the
door
for
a
long
time
against
all
efforts
even
the
most
judicious
to
spread
the
gospel
amongst
a
people
so
needlessly
and
greatly
prejudiced
against
it
by
an
unwise
and
abrupt
application
of
its
principles
for
instance
what
folly
and
madness
it
would
be
for
our
missionaries
to
burmah
to
make
a
direct
assault
on
the
political
institutions
of
that
country
how
fatal
would
it
be
to
their
lives
and
how
incalculably
injurious
to
the
cause
entrusted
to
their
hands
and
if
this
can
be
said
of
them
after
they
have
spent
ten
fifteen
and
twenty
years
in
efforts
to
bring
that
portion
of
the
heathen
world
to
a
knowledge
and
love
of
the
truth
how
much
more
emphatically
could
it
be
said
if
they
had
been
in
the
field
of
their
labors
but
three
or
four
years
and
yet
even
this
short
space
of
time
exceeds
the
average
period
of
the
apostles
labor
among
those
different
portions
of
the
heathen
world
which
they
visited
labor
too
it
must
be
remembered
not
of
the
whole
nor
even
of
half
of
the
twelve
that
the
apostles
could
not
have
made
direct
attacks
on
the
institutions
of
the
roman
government
but
at
the
expense
of
their
lives
is
not
to
be
doubted
our
saviour
well
knew
how
fatal
was
the
jealousy
of
that
government
to
the
man
who
was
so
unhappy
as
to
have
excited
it
and
he
accordingly
avoided
the
excitement
of
it
as
far
as
practicable
and
consistent
his
ingenious
and
beautiful
disposition
of
the
question
is
it
lawful
to
give
tribute
to
caesar
or
not
is
among
the
instances
in
which
he
studied
to
shun
the
displeasure
of
the
civil
government
pilate
gave
striking
evidence
of
his
unwillingness
to
excite
the
jealousy
of
his
government
when
every
other
expedient
to
induce
him
to
consent
to
the
saviour
death
having
failed
the
bare
charge
utterly
unproven
and
groundless
that
the
divine
prisoner
had
put
forth
pretensions
interfering
with
caesar
rights
availed
to
procure
his
from
the
hands
of
that
but
governor
had
it
not
availed
pilate
would
have
been
exposed
to
the
suspicion
of
disloyalty
to
his
government
and
so
perilous
was
this
suspicion
that
he
was
ready
at
any
expense
to
his
conscience
and
sense
of
justice
to
avoid
incurring
it
a
direct
attack
on
roman
slavery
as
it
would
have
called
in
question
the
rightfulness
of
war
the
leading
policy
of
the
roman
government
would
of
course
have
been
peculiarly
perilous
to
its
presumptuous
author
no
person
could
have
made
this
attack
and
lived
or
if
possibly
he
might
have
escaped
the
vengeance
of
the
government
do
we
not
know
too
much
of
the
deadly
wrath
of
slaveholders
to
believe
that
he
could
have
also
escaped
the
summary
process
of
lynch
law
if
it
be
at
the
peril
of
his
life
that
a
northern
man
travels
in
the
southern
states
and
that
too
whether
he
do
or
do
not
say
a
word
about
slavery
or
even
whether
he
be
or
be
not
an
abolitionist
if
your
leading
men
publicly
declare
that
it
is
your
religious
duty
to
put
to
an
immediate
death
whenever
they
come
within
your
power
those
who
presume
to
say
that
slavery
is
sin
and
such
a
declaration
did
a
south
carolina
gentleman
make
on
the
floor
of
congress
respecting
the
inconsiderable
person
who
is
addressing
you
and
if
your
professing
christians
not
excepting
ministers
of
the
gospel
thirst
for
the
blood
of
abolitionists
a
as
i
will
abundantly
show
if
you
require
proof
if
in
a
gospel
land
all
this
be
so
then
i
put
it
to
your
candor
whether
it
can
reasonably
be
supposed
that
the
apostles
would
have
been
allowed
to
attack
slavery
in
the
midst
of
heathen
slaveholders
why
it
is
that
slaveholders
will
not
allow
a
word
to
be
breathed
against
slavery
i
can
not
perhaps
correctly
judge
abolitionists
think
that
this
unwillingness
denotes
that
man
is
unfit
for
absolute
power
over
his
fellow
men
they
think
as
unfavorably
of
the
influence
of
this
power
on
the
slaveholder
as
your
own
jefferson
did
they
think
that
it
tends
to
make
him
impatient
of
contradiction
supercilious
cruel
murderous
devilish
and
they
think
that
they
can
establish
this
opinion
not
by
the
soundest
philosophy
only
but
by
the
pages
of
many
of
your
own
writers
and
by
those
daily
scenes
of
horrid
brutality
which
make
the
southern
states
in
the
sight
both
of
god
and
man
one
of
the
most
frightful
and
loathsome
portions
of
the
world
of
the
whole
world
barbarous
as
well
as
civilized
footnote
a
i
will
relate
an
incident
to
show
what
a
fiend
even
woman
gentle
lovely
woman
may
become
after
she
has
fallen
under
the
sway
of
the
demon
of
slavery
said
a
lady
of
savannah
on
a
visit
in
the
city
of
new
york
i
wish
he
rev
samuel
cox
would
come
to
savannah
i
should
love
to
see
him
tarred
and
feathered
and
his
head
cut
off
and
carried
on
a
pole
around
savannah
this
lady
is
a
professing
christian
her
language
stirs
me
up
to
retaliate
upon
her
and
to
express
the
wish
that
she
would
come
to
the
town
and
even
to
the
dwelling
in
which
cox
resides
she
would
find
that
man
of
god
that
man
of
sanctified
genius
as
glad
to
get
his
enemies
into
his
hands
as
she
would
be
to
get
him
into
the
hands
of
his
enemies
not
however
for
the
purpose
of
disgracing
and
decapitating
them
but
that
he
might
pour
out
upon
them
the
forgiveness
and
love
of
his
generous
and
heart
in
the
city
of
new
york
there
are
thousands
of
abolitionists
what
a
striking
testimony
is
it
in
behalf
of
their
meekness
and
forbearance
when
a
southern
fury
is
perfectly
secure
in
belching
out
such
words
of
wrath
in
the
midst
of
them
we
abolitionists
never
love
our
principles
better
than
when
we
see
the
slaveholder
feeling
safe
amongst
us
no
man
has
been
more
abusive
of
us
than
governor
mcduffie
and
yet
were
he
to
travel
in
the
northern
states
he
would
meet
with
no
unkindness
at
the
hands
of
any
abolitionist
on
the
other
hand
let
it
be
known
to
the
governor
that
he
has
within
his
jurisdiction
a
prominent
abolitionist
one
whose
heart
of
burning
love
has
made
him
specially
anxious
to
persuade
the
unfortunate
slaveholder
to
be
just
to
himself
to
his
fellow
men
and
to
his
god
and
the
governor
true
to
the
horrid
sentiments
of
his
famous
message
would
advise
that
he
be
put
to
death
without
benefit
of
clergy
let
slaveholders
say
what
they
will
about
our
there
is
not
one
of
them
who
fears
to
put
himself
in
our
power
the
many
of
them
who
have
been
beneath
my
roof
and
the
roofs
of
other
abolitionists
have
manifested
their
confidence
in
our
kindness
were
a
stranger
to
the
institution
of
slavery
to
learn
in
answer
to
his
inquiries
that
an
abolitionist
is
an
outlaw
amongst
slaveholders
and
that
a
slaveholder
is
the
kindly
entertained
guest
of
abolitionists
here
would
be
a
puzzle
indeed
but
the
solution
of
it
would
not
fail
to
be
as
honorable
to
the
persecuted
man
of
peace
as
it
would
be
disgraceful
to
the
bloody
advocate
and
executioner
of
lynch
law
i
need
not
render
any
more
reasons
why
the
apostles
did
not
specifically
attack
slavery
but
i
will
reply
to
a
question
which
i
am
sure
will
be
upon
your
lips
all
the
time
you
are
reading
those
i
have
rendered
this
question
is
if
the
apostles
did
not
make
such
an
attack
on
slavery
why
may
the
american
abolitionists
i
answer
that
the
difference
between
the
course
of
the
abolitionists
and
of
the
apostles
in
this
matter
is
justified
by
the
difference
in
their
circumstances
professor
hodge
properly
says
that
our
course
should
be
like
theirs
unless
it
can
be
shown
that
their
circumstances
were
so
different
from
ours
as
to
make
the
rule
of
duty
different
in
the
two
cases
and
he
as
properly
adds
the
obligation
to
point
out
and
establish
this
difference
rests
upon
the
abolitionists
the
reasons
i
have
given
why
the
apostles
did
not
directly
attack
slavery
do
not
apply
to
the
abolitionists
the
arm
of
civil
power
does
not
restrain
us
from
attacking
it
to
open
our
lips
against
the
policy
and
institutions
of
civil
government
is
not
certain
death
a
despotic
government
restricted
the
efforts
of
the
apostles
to
do
good
but
we
live
under
governments
which
afford
the
widest
scope
for
exertions
to
bless
our
fellow
men
and
honor
god
now
if
we
may
not
avail
ourselves
of
this
advantage
simply
because
the
apostles
did
not
have
it
to
avail
themselves
of
then
whatever
other
interests
may
prosper
under
a
republican
government
certain
it
is
that
the
cause
of
truth
and
righteousness
is
not
to
be
benefited
by
it
far
better
never
to
have
had
our
boasted
form
of
government
if
whilst
it
extends
the
freedom
and
multiplies
the
facilities
of
the
wicked
it
relieves
the
righteous
of
none
of
the
restrictions
of
a
despotic
government
again
there
is
a
religious
conscience
all
over
this
land
and
an
enlightened
and
gospel
sense
of
right
and
wrong
on
which
we
can
and
do
as
in
your
introduction
you
concede
is
the
fact
bring
our
arguments
against
slavery
to
bear
with
mighty
power
but
on
the
other
hand
the
creating
of
such
a
conscience
and
such
a
sense
in
the
heathen
and
amongst
whom
they
lived
and
labored
was
the
first
and
appropriate
and
principal
work
of
the
apostles
to
employ
therefore
no
other
methods
for
the
moral
and
religious
improvement
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
than
were
employed
by
the
apostles
for
that
of
the
people
of
the
roman
empire
is
as
absurd
as
it
would
be
to
put
the
highest
and
lowest
classes
in
a
school
to
the
same
lessons
or
a
raw
apprentice
to
those
higher
branches
of
his
trade
which
demand
the
skill
of
an
experienced
workman
i
am
here
reminded
of
what
professor
hodge
says
were
the
means
relied
on
by
the
saviour
and
apostles
for
abolishing
slavery
it
was
says
he
by
teaching
the
true
nature
dignity
equality
and
destiny
of
men
by
inculcating
the
principles
of
justice
and
love
and
by
leaving
these
principles
to
produce
their
legitimate
effects
in
ameliorating
the
condition
of
all
classes
of
society
i
would
not
speak
disparagingly
of
such
a
course
of
instruction
so
far
from
it
i
am
ready
to
admit
that
it
is
indispensable
for
the
removal
of
evils
in
every
age
and
among
every
people
when
general
instructions
of
this
character
shall
have
ceased
to
be
given
then
will
all
wholesome
reforms
have
ceased
also
but
i
can
not
approve
of
the
professor
object
in
this
remark
this
object
is
to
induce
his
readers
to
believe
that
these
abstract
and
general
instructions
are
all
that
is
needed
to
effect
the
termination
of
slavery
now
i
maintain
that
one
thing
more
is
wanting
and
that
is
the
application
of
these
instructions
of
the
principles
contained
in
them
to
the
evil
in
hand
as
well
may
it
be
supposed
that
the
mechanic
can
accomplish
his
work
without
the
application
and
by
the
mere
possession
of
his
tools
as
that
a
given
reformation
can
be
effected
by
unapplied
general
principles
of
these
principles
american
philanthropists
have
been
possessed
from
time
immemorial
and
yet
all
the
while
american
slavery
has
been
flourishing
and
growing
strong
of
late
however
these
principles
have
been
brought
to
bear
upon
the
system
and
it
manifestly
is
already
giving
way
the
groans
of
the
monster
prove
that
those
rays
of
truth
which
did
not
disturb
him
whilst
they
continued
to
move
in
the
parallel
lines
of
abstractions
and
generalities
make
it
quite
too
hot
for
him
since
they
are
converged
to
a
burning
focus
upon
his
devoted
head
why
is
it
for
example
that
the
influence
of
the
boston
recorder
and
observer
why
is
it
that
the
influence
of
most
of
our
titled
divines
is
decidedly
hostile
to
the
abolition
of
slavery
it
is
not
because
they
are
deficient
in
just
general
sentiments
and
principles
respecting
man
duties
to
god
and
his
fellow
man
it
is
simply
because
they
stand
opposed
to
the
application
of
these
sentiments
and
principles
to
the
evil
in
question
or
in
other
words
stand
opposed
to
the
society
which
is
the
chosen
lens
of
divine
providence
for
turning
these
sentiments
and
principles
with
all
the
burning
irresistible
power
of
their
concentration
against
a
giant
wickedness
what
is
the
work
of
the
temperance
societies
but
to
make
a
specific
application
of
general
truths
and
principles
to
the
vice
of
intemperance
and
the
fact
that
from
the
time
of
intoxication
until
the
organization
of
the
american
temperance
society
the
desolating
tide
of
intemperance
had
been
continually
swelling
proves
that
this
reliance
on
unapplied
principles
however
sound
this
faith
without
works
is
utterly
vain
nathan
found
that
nothing
short
of
a
specific
application
of
the
principles
of
righteousness
would
answer
in
the
case
of
the
sin
of
adultery
he
had
to
abandon
all
generalities
and
circuitousness
and
come
plump
upon
the
royal
sinner
with
his
thou
art
the
man
those
divines
whose
policy
it
is
to
handle
slaveholders
with
gloves
if
they
must
handle
them
at
all
doubtless
regard
nathan
as
an
exceedingly
impolite
preacher
but
not
only
is
it
far
less
difficult
to
instruct
the
people
of
the
united
states
than
it
was
the
people
of
the
roman
empire
in
the
sin
of
slavery
it
is
also
for
the
reason
that
the
sin
is
ours
to
a
far
greater
extent
than
it
was
theirs
much
more
important
for
us
than
for
them
to
be
instructed
in
it
they
had
no
share
in
the
government
which
upheld
it
they
could
not
abolish
it
by
law
but
on
the
other
hand
the
people
of
the
united
states
are
themselves
the
government
of
their
country
they
are
the
of
their
nation
they
uphold
slavery
by
law
and
they
can
put
it
down
by
law
in
this
point
of
view
therefore
slavery
is
an
incomparably
greater
sin
in
us
than
it
was
in
them
only
one
other
reason
will
be
given
why
it
is
more
needful
to
overthrow
american
than
it
was
to
overthrow
roman
slavery
the
church
was
then
but
a
handful
of
strangers
scattered
throughout
the
heathen
world
it
was
made
up
of
those
who
had
little
influence
and
who
were
esteemed
the
filth
of
the
world
and
the
offscouring
of
all
things
it
had
probably
little
if
any
thing
to
do
with
slavery
except
to
suffer
its
rigors
in
the
persons
of
many
of
its
members
but
here
the
church
comprising
no
very
small
proportion
of
the
whole
population
and
exerting
a
mighty
influence
for
good
or
ill
on
the
residue
is
tainted
yes
rotten
with
slavery
in
this
contrast
we
not
only
see
another
reason
why
the
destruction
of
american
slavery
is
more
important
than
was
that
of
roman
slavery
but
we
also
see
that
the
apostles
could
have
been
little
if
at
all
actuated
by
that
motive
which
is
more
urgent
than
any
other
in
the
breasts
of
the
american
abolitionists
the
motive
of
purging
the
church
of
slavery
to
return
to
what
you
say
of
the
abominations
and
horrors
of
greek
and
roman
slavery
i
should
be
doing
you
great
injustice
were
i
to
convey
the
idea
that
you
approve
of
them
it
is
admitted
that
you
disapprove
of
them
and
it
is
also
admitted
that
no
responsibility
for
them
rests
on
the
relation
of
slaveholder
and
slave
if
that
relation
have
as
you
labor
to
show
the
stamp
of
divine
approbation
you
say
that
slavery
like
marriage
is
an
institution
sanctioned
by
the
new
testament
and
that
therefore
neither
for
the
evils
which
attend
it
nor
for
any
other
cause
is
it
to
be
argued
against
this
is
sound
reasoning
on
your
part
and
if
your
premises
are
correct
there
is
no
resisting
your
deduction
we
are
in
that
case
not
only
not
to
complain
of
the
institution
of
slavery
but
we
are
to
be
thankful
for
it
considering
however
that
the
whole
fabric
of
your
argument
in
the
principal
or
new
testament
division
of
your
book
is
based
on
the
alleged
fact
that
the
new
testament
approves
of
slavery
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
contented
yourself
and
sought
to
make
your
readers
contented
with
very
slender
evidences
of
the
truth
of
this
proposition
these
evidences
are
mainly
that
the
new
testament
does
not
declare
slavery
to
be
a
sin
and
that
the
apostles
enjoin
upon
masters
and
servants
their
respective
duties
and
this
too
in
the
same
connexion
in
which
they
make
similar
injunctions
upon
those
who
stand
in
the
confessedly
proper
relations
of
life
the
husband
and
wife
the
parent
and
child
your
other
evidences
that
the
new
testament
approves
of
slavery
unimportant
as
they
are
will
not
be
left
unnoticed
i
have
attempted
to
show
that
the
omission
of
the
new
testament
to
declare
slavery
to
be
a
sin
is
not
proof
that
it
is
not
a
sin
i
pass
on
to
show
that
the
apostolic
injunction
of
duties
upon
masters
and
servants
does
not
prove
that
slavery
is
sinless
i
have
now
reached
another
grand
fallacy
in
your
book
it
is
also
found
in
professor
hodge
article
you
gentlemen
take
the
liberty
to
depart
from
our
standard
english
translation
of
the
bible
and
to
substitute
slaveholder
for
master
slave
for
servant
and
in
substance
emperor
for
ruler
and
subject
of
an
imperial
government
for
subject
of
civil
government
generally
i
know
that
this
substitution
well
suits
your
purposes
but
i
know
not
by
what
right
you
make
it
professor
hodge
tells
the
abolitionists
certainly
without
much
respect
for
either
their
intelligence
or
piety
that
it
will
do
no
good
for
them
to
attempt
to
tear
the
bible
to
pieces
there
is
but
too
much
evidence
that
he
himself
has
not
entirely
refrained
from
the
folly
and
crime
which
he
is
so
ready
to
impute
to
others
i
will
proceed
to
offer
some
reasons
for
the
belief
that
when
the
apostles
enjoined
on
masters
and
servants
their
respective
duties
they
had
reference
to
servitude
in
general
and
not
to
any
modification
of
it
you
find
passages
in
the
new
testament
where
you
think
refers
to
a
person
who
is
a
slaveholder
and
to
a
person
who
is
a
slave
admit
that
you
are
right
but
this
which
seems
to
be
your
only
ground
for
it
does
not
justify
you
in
translating
these
words
slaveholder
and
slave
whenever
it
may
be
advantageous
to
your
side
of
the
question
to
have
them
thus
translated
these
words
have
a
great
variety
of
meanings
for
instance
there
are
passages
in
the
new
testament
where
means
god
jesus
christ
head
of
a
family
and
where
means
a
minister
or
agent
a
subject
of
a
king
a
disciple
or
follower
of
christ
and
are
the
words
used
in
the
original
of
the
expression
lord
now
lettest
thou
thy
servant
depart
in
peace
in
that
of
the
expressions
servant
of
christ
and
let
him
be
servant
of
all
profane
writers
also
use
these
words
in
various
senses
my
full
belief
is
that
these
words
were
used
in
both
a
generic
and
special
sense
as
is
the
word
corn
which
denotes
in
general
and
also
a
particular
kind
of
them
as
is
the
word
meat
the
meaning
of
which
is
sometimes
confined
to
flesh
that
is
eaten
and
at
other
times
as
is
frequently
the
case
in
the
scriptures
extends
to
food
in
general
and
as
is
the
word
servant
which
is
suitable
either
in
reference
to
a
particular
form
of
servitude
or
to
servitude
in
general
there
is
a
passage
in
the
second
chapter
of
acts
which
is
of
itself
perhaps
sufficient
to
convince
an
unbiased
mind
that
the
apostles
used
the
word
in
a
generic
as
well
as
in
a
special
sense
and
are
the
words
in
the
phrase
and
on
my
servants
and
on
my
handmaidens
a
reference
to
the
prophecy
as
it
stands
in
joel
makes
it
more
obvious
that
persons
in
servitude
are
referred
to
under
the
words
and
and
that
the
predicted
blessing
was
to
be
shed
upon
persons
of
all
ages
classes
and
conditions
upon
old
men
and
young
men
upon
sons
and
daughters
and
upon
and
but
under
the
interpretation
of
those
who
like
professor
hodge
and
yourself
confine
the
meaning
of
and
to
a
species
of
servants
the
prophecy
would
have
reference
to
persons
of
all
ages
classes
and
conditions
certain
descriptions
of
under
this
interpretation
we
are
brought
to
the
absurd
conclusion
that
the
spirit
is
to
be
poured
out
upon
the
master
and
his
slaves
not
upon
his
hired
i
trust
that
enough
has
been
said
under
this
my
first
head
to
show
that
the
various
senses
in
which
the
words
and
are
employed
justify
me
in
taking
the
position
that
whenever
we
meet
with
them
we
are
to
determine
from
the
nature
of
the
case
and
from
the
connexion
in
which
they
are
used
whether
they
refer
to
servitude
in
general
or
to
a
species
of
it
the
confinement
of
the
meaning
of
the
words
in
question
supposes
what
neither
religion
nor
common
sense
allows
us
to
suppose
that
slaveholders
and
slaves
despots
and
those
in
subjection
to
them
were
such
especial
favorites
of
the
apostles
as
to
obtain
from
them
specific
instructions
in
respect
to
their
relative
duties
whilst
all
other
masters
and
servants
and
all
other
rulers
and
subjects
throughout
all
future
time
were
left
unprovided
with
such
instructions
according
to
this
supposition
when
slavery
and
despotism
shall
agreeably
to
professor
hodge
expectations
have
entirely
ceased
there
will
be
not
one
master
nor
servant
not
one
ruler
nor
subject
in
the
whole
earth
to
fall
as
such
under
the
apostolic
injunctions
you
admit
that
there
were
hirelings
in
a
community
of
primitive
believers
and
i
admit
for
the
moment
that
there
were
slaves
in
it
now
under
my
interpretation
of
the
apostolic
injunction
all
husbands
all
wives
all
parents
all
children
and
all
servants
in
this
community
are
told
their
respective
duties
but
under
yours
these
duties
are
enjoined
on
all
husbands
all
wives
all
parents
all
children
and
a
of
the
may
we
not
reasonably
complain
of
your
interpretation
that
it
violates
analogy
imagine
the
scene
in
which
a
father
in
the
apostolic
age
assembles
his
family
to
listen
to
a
letter
from
the
glowing
peter
or
such
an
one
as
paul
the
aged
the
letter
contains
instructions
respecting
the
relative
duties
of
life
the
venerable
pair
who
stand
in
the
conjugal
and
parental
relations
receive
with
calm
thankfulness
what
is
addressed
to
themselves
the
little
ones
are
eager
to
know
what
the
apostle
says
to
children
a
poor
slave
blesses
god
for
his
portion
of
the
apostolic
counsel
and
the
scene
would
be
one
of
unmingled
joy
if
the
writer
had
but
addressed
hired
servants
as
well
as
slaves
one
of
the
group
goes
away
to
weep
because
the
apostle
had
remembered
the
necessities
of
all
other
classes
of
men
and
forgotten
those
of
the
hireling
sir
do
you
believe
that
the
apostle
was
guilty
of
such
an
omission
i
rejoice
that
my
side
of
the
question
between
us
does
not
call
for
the
belief
of
what
is
so
improbable
and
unnatural
and
withal
so
dishonoring
to
the
memory
of
the
apostle
another
reason
for
believing
that
the
apostles
intended
no
such
limitation
as
that
which
you
impose
upon
their
words
is
that
their
injunctions
are
as
applicable
to
the
other
classes
of
persons
occupying
these
relations
as
they
are
to
the
particular
class
to
which
you
confine
them
the
hired
servant
as
well
as
the
slave
needs
to
be
admonished
of
the
sins
of
eye
service
and
purloining
and
the
master
of
voluntary
as
well
as
involuntary
servants
needs
to
be
admonished
to
give
that
which
is
just
and
equal
the
ruler
in
a
republic
or
in
a
limited
monarchy
as
well
as
the
despot
requires
to
be
reminded
that
he
is
to
be
a
minister
of
god
for
good
so
the
subject
of
one
kind
of
civil
government
as
well
as
that
of
another
needs
to
be
told
to
be
subject
unto
the
higher
powers
i
need
not
extend
my
remarks
to
prove
that
and
are
in
the
case
before
us
to
be
taken
in
their
comprehensive
sense
of
master
and
servant
and
clearly
therefore
the
abolitionist
is
not
guilty
of
violating
your
rule
not
to
interfere
with
a
civil
relation
in
another
place
you
say
of
the
existing
relations
of
life
for
which
and
to
regulate
which
either
christ
or
his
apostles
have
prescribed
regulations
he
believes
as
fully
as
yourself
that
the
relation
of
master
and
servant
is
approved
of
god
it
is
the
slavery
modification
of
it
the
slaveholder
abuse
and
perversion
of
the
relation
in
reducing
the
servant
to
a
chattel
which
he
believes
is
not
approved
of
god
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
i
will
admit
that
the
slave
alone
of
all
classes
of
servants
was
favored
with
specific
instructions
from
the
apostles
and
then
how
should
we
account
for
the
selection
in
no
other
way
can
i
conceive
than
on
the
ground
that
his
lot
is
so
peculiarly
hard
so
much
harder
than
that
of
persons
under
other
forms
of
servitude
that
he
needs
whilst
they
do
not
apostolic
counsel
and
advice
to
keep
him
just
and
patient
and
submissive
let
me
be
spared
from
the
sin
of
reducing
a
brother
man
to
such
a
lot
your
doctrine
therefore
that
the
apostles
addressed
slaves
only
and
not
servants
in
general
would
not
were
its
correctness
admitted
lift
you
out
of
all
the
difficulties
in
your
argument
again
does
it
necessarily
follow
from
this
admission
that
the
relation
of
slaveholder
and
slave
is
sinless
was
the
despotism
of
the
roman
government
sinless
i
do
not
ask
whether
the
of
civil
government
in
that
instance
were
sinless
but
i
ask
was
a
government
despotic
in
its
constitution
depriving
all
its
subjects
of
political
power
and
extending
absolute
control
over
their
property
and
persons
was
such
a
government
independently
of
the
consideration
of
its
if
indeed
we
may
speak
of
the
abuses
of
what
is
in
itself
an
sinless
i
am
aware
that
hodge
says
that
it
was
so
and
when
he
classes
despotism
and
slavery
with
things
indifferent
and
allows
no
more
moral
character
to
them
than
to
a
table
or
a
broomstick
i
trust
no
good
man
envies
his
optics
may
i
not
hope
that
you
smylie
perceive
a
difference
between
despotism
and
an
indifferent
thing
may
i
not
hope
that
you
will
both
as
a
republican
and
a
christian
take
the
ground
that
despotism
has
a
moral
character
and
a
bad
one
when
our
fathers
prayed
and
toiled
and
bled
to
obtain
for
themselves
and
their
children
the
right
of
and
to
effect
their
liberation
from
a
power
which
in
the
extent
and
rigor
of
its
despotism
is
no
more
to
be
compared
to
the
roman
government
than
the
little
finger
to
the
loins
i
doubt
not
that
they
felt
that
despotism
had
a
moral
and
a
very
bad
moral
character
and
so
would
hodge
have
felt
had
he
stood
by
their
side
instead
of
being
one
of
their
ungrateful
sons
i
say
ungrateful
for
who
more
so
than
he
who
publishes
doctrines
that
disparage
the
holy
cause
in
which
they
were
embarked
and
exhibits
them
as
contending
for
straws
rather
than
for
principles
tell
me
how
long
will
this
republic
endure
after
our
people
shall
have
imbibed
the
doctrine
that
the
of
civil
government
is
an
indifferent
thing
and
that
the
poet
was
right
when
he
said
for
forms
of
government
let
contest
this
however
is
but
one
of
many
doctrines
of
ruinous
tendency
to
the
cause
of
civil
liberty
advanced
by
writers
to
sustain
their
system
of
oppression
it
would
surely
be
superfluous
to
go
into
proofs
that
the
roman
government
was
vicious
and
wicked
in
its
constitution
and
nature
nevertheless
the
apostle
enjoined
submission
to
it
and
taught
its
subjects
how
to
demean
themselves
under
it
here
then
we
have
an
instance
in
which
we
can
not
argue
the
sinlessness
of
a
relation
from
the
fact
of
apostolic
injunctions
on
those
standing
in
it
take
another
instance
the
chaldeans
went
to
a
foreign
land
and
enslaved
its
people
as
members
of
your
guilty
partnership
have
done
for
some
of
the
slaves
you
now
own
and
for
the
ancestors
of
others
and
god
destroyed
the
chaldeans
expressly
for
all
their
evil
that
they
had
done
in
zion
but
wicked
as
they
were
for
having
instituted
this
relation
between
themselves
and
the
jews
god
nevertheless
tells
the
jews
to
submit
to
it
he
tells
them
serve
the
king
of
babylon
he
even
says
seek
the
peace
of
the
city
whither
i
have
caused
you
to
be
carried
away
captives
and
pray
unto
the
lord
for
it
for
in
the
peace
thereof
shall
ye
have
peace
here
then
we
have
another
instance
in
addition
to
that
of
the
roman
despot
and
his
subjects
in
which
the
holy
spirit
prescribed
regulations
for
wicked
relations
you
will
at
least
allow
that
the
relation
established
by
the
chaldeans
between
themselves
and
the
captive
jews
was
wicked
but
you
will
perhaps
say
that
this
is
not
a
relation
coming
within
the
contemplation
of
your
rule
your
rule
speaks
of
a
civil
relation
and
also
of
the
existing
relations
of
life
but
the
relation
in
question
being
substantially
that
of
slaveholder
and
slave
is
according
to
your
own
showing
a
civil
relation
perhaps
you
will
say
it
is
not
an
existing
relation
of
life
but
what
do
you
mean
by
an
existing
relation
of
life
do
you
mean
that
it
is
a
relation
approved
of
god
if
you
do
and
insist
that
the
relation
of
slaveholder
and
slave
is
an
existing
relation
of
life
then
you
are
guilty
of
begging
the
great
question
between
us
your
rule
therefore
can
mean
nothing
more
than
this
that
any
relation
is
rightful
for
which
the
bible
prescribes
regulations
but
the
relation
referred
to
between
the
chaldeans
and
jews
proves
the
falsity
of
the
rule
again
when
a
man
compels
me
to
go
with
him
is
not
the
compelled
relation
between
him
and
me
a
sinful
one
and
the
relation
of
robber
and
robbed
which
a
man
institutes
between
himself
and
me
is
not
this
also
sinful
but
the
bible
has
prescribed
regulations
for
the
relations
in
both
these
cases
in
the
one
it
requires
me
to
go
with
him
twain
and
in
the
other
to
endure
patiently
even
farther
spoliation
and
let
him
have
my
cloak
also
in
these
cases
also
do
we
see
the
falsity
of
your
rule
and
none
the
less
clearly
because
the
relations
in
question
are
of
brief
duration
before
concluding
my
remarks
on
this
topic
let
me
say
that
your
doctrine
that
god
has
prescribed
no
rules
for
the
behaviour
of
persons
in
any
other
than
the
just
relations
of
life
reflects
no
honor
on
his
compassion
why
even
we
abolitionists
are
not
so
as
to
overlook
the
subjects
of
a
relation
because
it
is
wicked
pitying
as
we
do
our
poor
colored
brethren
who
are
forced
into
a
wicked
relation
which
by
its
very
nature
and
terms
and
not
by
its
as
you
would
say
has
robbed
them
of
their
all
even
we
would
nevertheless
tell
them
to
resist
not
evil
to
be
obedient
unto
their
own
masters
not
purloining
but
showing
all
good
fidelity
we
would
tell
them
as
god
told
the
captive
jews
to
seek
the
peace
of
those
whither
they
are
carried
away
captives
and
to
pray
unto
the
lord
for
them
and
our
hope
of
their
emancipation
is
not
as
it
is
most
slanderously
and
wickedly
reported
to
be
in
their
deluging
the
south
with
blood
but
it
is
to
use
again
those
sweet
words
of
inspiration
that
in
the
peace
thereof
they
shall
have
peace
we
do
not
communicate
with
the
slave
but
if
we
did
we
would
teach
him
that
our
hope
of
his
liberation
is
grounded
largely
in
his
patience
and
that
if
he
would
have
us
drop
his
cause
from
our
hands
he
has
but
to
take
it
into
his
own
and
attempt
to
accomplish
by
violence
that
which
we
seek
to
effect
through
the
power
of
truth
and
love
on
the
understanding
and
heart
of
his
master
having
disposed
of
your
reasons
in
favor
of
the
rightfulness
of
the
relation
of
slaveholder
and
slave
i
will
offer
a
few
reasons
for
believing
that
it
is
not
rightful
my
strongest
reason
is
that
the
great
and
comprehensive
principles
and
the
whole
genius
and
spirit
of
christianity
are
opposed
to
slavery
in
the
case
of
pharoah
and
his
jewish
slaves
god
manifested
his
abhorrence
of
the
relation
of
slavery
the
fact
that
the
slavery
in
this
case
was
political
instead
of
domestic
and
therefore
of
a
milder
type
than
that
of
southern
slavery
does
not
forbid
my
reasoning
from
the
one
form
to
the
other
indeed
if
i
may
receive
your
declaration
on
this
point
for
the
truth
i
need
not
admit
that
the
type
of
the
slavery
in
question
is
milder
than
that
of
southern
slavery
for
you
say
that
their
the
jews
condition
was
that
of
the
most
abject
bondage
or
slavery
but
the
supposition
that
it
is
milder
being
allowed
to
be
correct
would
only
prove
that
god
abhorrence
of
southern
bondage
as
much
exceeds
that
which
he
expressed
of
egyptian
bondage
as
the
one
system
is
more
full
than
the
other
of
oppression
and
cruelty
we
learn
from
the
bible
that
it
was
not
because
of
the
of
the
egyptian
system
of
bondage
but
because
of
its
sinful
nature
that
god
required
its
abolition
he
did
not
command
pharaoh
to
cease
from
the
of
the
system
and
to
correct
his
administration
of
it
but
to
cease
from
the
system
itself
i
have
heard
says
god
the
groaning
of
the
children
of
israel
whom
the
egyptians
keep
in
bondage
not
whom
the
egyptians
availing
themselves
of
their
absolute
power
compel
to
make
brick
without
straw
and
seek
to
waste
and
exterminate
by
the
murder
of
their
infant
children
but
simply
whom
the
egyptians
keep
in
bondage
these
hardships
and
outrages
were
but
the
leaves
and
branches
the
root
of
the
abomination
was
the
bondage
itself
the
assertion
of
absolute
and
slaveholding
power
by
a
new
king
over
egypt
which
knew
not
joseph
in
the
next
verse
god
says
i
will
rid
you
not
only
from
the
burdens
and
abuses
as
you
would
say
of
bondage
but
out
of
their
the
egyptians
bondage
itself
out
of
the
relation
in
which
the
egyptians
oppressively
and
wickedly
hold
you
god
sends
many
messages
to
pharaoh
in
no
one
of
them
does
he
reprove
him
for
the
abuses
of
the
relation
into
which
he
had
forced
the
jews
in
no
one
of
them
is
he
called
on
to
correct
the
evils
which
had
grown
out
of
that
relation
but
in
every
one
does
god
go
to
the
root
of
the
evil
and
command
pharaoh
let
my
people
go
let
my
people
go
that
they
may
serve
me
the
abolitionist
is
reproachfully
called
an
ultraist
and
an
immediatist
it
seems
that
god
was
both
when
dealing
with
this
royal
slaveholder
for
he
commanded
pharaoh
not
to
mitigate
the
bondage
of
the
israelites
but
to
deliver
them
from
it
and
that
too
immediately
the
system
of
slavery
is
wicked
in
god
sight
and
therefore
did
he
require
of
pharaoh
its
immediate
abandonment
the
phrase
let
my
people
go
that
they
may
serve
me
shows
most
strikingly
one
feature
of
resemblance
between
egyptian
and
american
slavery
egyptian
slavery
did
not
allow
its
subjects
to
serve
god
neither
does
american
the
egyptian
master
stood
between
his
slave
and
their
god
and
how
strikingly
and
awfully
true
is
it
that
the
american
master
occupies
the
like
position
not
only
is
the
theory
of
slavery
the
world
over
in
the
face
of
god
declaration
all
souls
are
mine
but
american
slaveholders
have
brought
its
practical
character
to
respond
so
fully
to
its
theory
they
have
succeeded
so
well
in
excluding
the
light
and
knowledge
of
god
from
the
minds
of
their
slaves
that
they
laugh
at
his
claim
to
all
souls
paul
in
one
of
his
letters
to
the
corinthian
church
tells
servants
say
slaves
to
suit
your
views
if
they
may
be
free
to
prefer
freedom
to
bondage
but
if
it
be
the
duty
of
slaves
to
prefer
freedom
to
bondage
how
clearly
is
it
the
correlative
duty
of
the
master
to
grant
it
to
him
you
interpret
the
apostle
language
in
this
case
as
i
do
and
it
is
not
a
little
surprising
that
with
your
interpretation
of
it
you
can
still
advocate
slavery
you
admit
that
paul
says
i
use
your
own
words
a
state
of
freedom
on
the
whole
is
the
best
now
it
seems
to
me
that
this
admission
leaves
you
without
excuse
for
defending
slavery
you
have
virtually
yielded
the
ground
and
this
admission
is
especially
fatal
to
your
strenuous
endeavors
to
class
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
with
the
confessedly
proper
relations
of
life
and
to
show
that
like
these
it
is
approved
of
god
would
paul
say
to
the
child
a
state
of
freedom
from
parental
government
on
the
whole
is
the
best
would
he
say
to
the
wife
a
state
of
freedom
from
your
conjugal
bonds
on
the
whole
is
the
best
would
he
say
to
the
child
and
wife
in
respect
to
this
freedom
use
it
rather
would
he
be
thus
guilty
of
attempting
to
annihilate
the
family
relation
does
any
one
wonder
that
the
apostle
did
not
use
stronger
language
in
advising
to
a
choice
and
enjoyment
of
freedom
it
is
similar
to
that
which
a
pious
intelligent
and
prudent
abolitionist
would
now
use
under
the
like
circumstances
paul
was
endeavoring
to
make
the
slave
contented
with
his
hard
lot
and
to
show
him
how
unimportant
is
personal
liberty
compared
with
liberation
from
spiritual
bondage
and
this
explains
why
it
is
that
he
spoke
so
briefly
and
moderately
of
the
advantages
of
liberty
his
advice
to
the
slave
to
accept
the
boon
of
freedom
was
a
purely
incidental
remark
and
we
can
not
infer
from
it
how
great
stress
he
would
have
laid
on
the
evils
of
slavery
and
on
the
blessings
of
liberty
in
a
discourse
treating
directly
and
mainly
of
those
subjects
what
i
have
previously
said
however
shows
that
it
would
probably
have
been
in
vain
and
worse
than
in
vain
for
him
to
have
come
out
on
any
occasion
whatever
with
an
exposition
of
the
evils
of
slavery
on
the
page
of
your
book
you
say
masters
can
not
according
to
the
command
of
christ
render
to
their
slaves
that
which
is
just
and
equal
if
you
abolish
the
relation
for
then
they
will
cease
to
be
masters
abolish
any
of
the
relations
for
which
regulations
are
provided
in
the
new
testament
and
in
effect
you
abolish
some
of
the
laws
of
christ
but
we
have
just
seen
that
paul
was
in
favor
of
abolishing
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
which
as
you
insist
is
a
relation
for
which
regulations
are
provided
in
the
new
testament
it
is
therefore
irresistibly
deduced
from
your
own
premises
that
he
was
in
favor
of
abolishing
the
laws
of
christ
it
would
require
but
little
if
any
extension
of
your
doctrine
to
make
it
wrong
to
remove
all
the
graven
images
out
of
a
nation
for
in
that
event
the
law
of
god
against
bowing
down
to
them
would
have
nothing
left
to
act
upon
it
would
thenceforth
be
inoperative
another
reason
for
believing
that
the
apostles
did
not
approve
of
the
slavery
modification
of
servitude
is
found
in
paul
injunction
remember
them
that
are
in
bonds
as
bound
with
them
i
admit
that
it
is
probable
that
others
as
well
as
slaves
are
referred
to
in
this
injunction
but
it
certainly
is
not
probable
that
others
to
the
exclusion
of
slaves
are
referred
to
but
even
on
the
supposition
that
slaves
are
not
referred
to
but
those
only
who
are
tenants
of
prisons
let
me
ask
you
which
you
would
rather
be
a
slave
or
a
prisoner
as
paul
probably
was
when
he
wrote
this
injunction
and
whether
your
own
description
of
the
wretched
condition
of
the
roman
slave
does
not
prepare
you
to
agree
with
me
that
if
the
apostle
could
ask
sympathy
for
the
prisoner
who
with
all
his
deprivations
has
still
the
protection
of
law
it
is
not
much
more
due
to
the
poor
slave
who
has
no
protection
whatever
against
lawless
tyranny
and
caprice
but
to
proceed
if
slaves
are
the
only
or
even
a
part
of
the
persons
referred
to
in
the
injunction
then
you
will
observe
that
the
apostle
does
not
call
for
the
exercise
of
sympathy
towards
those
who
are
said
to
be
suffering
what
you
call
the
of
slavery
but
towards
those
who
are
so
unhappy
as
to
be
but
the
subjects
of
it
towards
those
who
are
in
bonds
the
bare
relation
of
a
slave
is
itself
so
grievous
as
to
call
for
compassion
towards
those
who
bear
it
now
if
this
relation
were
to
be
classed
with
the
approved
relations
of
life
why
should
the
apostle
have
undertaken
to
awaken
compassion
for
persons
simply
because
they
were
the
subject
of
it
he
never
asked
for
sympathy
for
persons
simply
because
they
were
parties
to
the
relations
of
husband
and
wife
parent
and
child
it
may
be
worthy
of
notice
that
the
injunction
under
consideration
is
found
in
paul
letter
to
the
jewish
christians
this
attempt
to
awaken
pity
in
behalf
of
the
slave
and
to
produce
abhorrence
of
slavery
was
made
upon
these
and
not
upon
the
gentile
christians
because
perhaps
that
they
who
had
always
possessed
the
oracles
of
god
could
bear
it
and
they
who
had
just
come
up
out
of
the
mire
of
heathenism
could
not
if
this
explanation
be
just
it
enforces
my
argument
for
ascribing
to
causes
other
than
the
alleged
sinfulness
of
the
institution
the
apostle
omission
to
utter
specific
rebukes
of
slavery
another
reason
for
believing
that
the
slavery
modification
of
servitude
should
not
be
classed
with
the
confessedly
proper
relations
with
which
you
class
it
is
the
conclusive
one
that
it
interferes
with
and
tends
to
subvert
and
does
actually
subvert
these
relations
the
apostles
prescribe
duties
which
are
necessary
to
sustain
these
relations
and
make
them
fruitful
sources
of
happiness
to
the
parties
to
them
among
these
duties
are
the
following
wives
submit
yourselves
to
your
own
husbands
as
it
is
fit
in
the
lord
children
obey
your
parents
husbands
dwell
with
them
your
wives
but
slavery
where
it
does
not
make
obedience
to
these
commands
utterly
impossible
conditions
it
on
the
permission
of
usurpers
who
have
presumed
to
step
between
the
laws
of
god
and
those
on
whom
they
are
intended
to
bear
slavery
not
the
law
of
god
practically
determines
whether
husbands
shall
dwell
with
their
wives
and
an
amount
of
anguish
which
god
alone
can
compute
testifies
that
slavery
has
thus
determined
times
without
number
that
husbands
shall
not
dwell
with
their
wives
a
distinguished
gentleman
who
has
been
much
at
the
south
is
spending
a
little
time
in
my
family
he
told
me
but
this
day
that
he
had
frequently
known
the
air
filled
with
shrieks
of
anguish
for
a
whole
mile
around
the
spot
where
under
the
hammer
of
the
auctioneer
the
members
of
a
family
were
undergoing
an
endless
separation
from
each
other
it
was
but
last
week
that
a
poor
fugitive
reached
a
family
in
which
god
commands
hide
the
outcasts
betray
not
him
that
wandereth
hide
not
thyself
from
thy
own
flesh
are
not
a
dead
letter
the
heaviest
burden
of
his
heart
is
that
he
has
not
seen
his
wife
for
five
years
and
does
not
expect
to
see
her
again
his
master
in
virginia
having
sold
him
to
a
georgian
and
his
wife
to
an
inhabitant
of
the
district
of
columbia
whilst
the
law
of
god
requires
wives
to
submit
themselves
to
their
husbands
as
it
is
fit
in
the
lord
the
law
of
slavery
commands
them
under
the
most
terrific
penalties
to
submit
to
every
conceivable
form
of
violence
and
the
most
loathsome
pollution
as
it
is
fit
in
the
eyes
of
slaveholders
no
small
proportion
of
whom
are
as
a
most
natural
fruit
of
slavery
abandoned
to
brutality
and
lust
the
laws
of
south
carolina
and
georgia
make
it
an
offence
punishable
with
death
if
any
slave
shall
presume
to
strike
a
white
person
by
the
laws
of
maryland
and
kentucky
it
is
enacted
if
any
negro
mulatto
or
indian
bond
or
free
shall
at
any
time
lift
his
or
her
hand
in
opposition
to
any
person
not
being
a
negro
or
indian
he
or
she
shall
in
the
state
suffer
the
penalty
of
cropped
ears
and
in
the
other
lashes
on
his
or
her
bare
back
well
laid
on
by
order
of
the
justice
in
louisiana
there
is
a
law
for
the
enactment
of
which
slavery
is
of
course
responsible
in
these
words
free
people
of
color
ought
never
to
insult
or
strike
white
people
nor
presume
to
conceive
themselves
equal
to
the
whites
but
on
the
contrary
they
ought
yield
to
them
on
every
and
never
speak
or
answer
them
but
with
respect
under
the
penalty
of
imprisonment
according
to
the
nature
of
the
offence
the
following
extract
of
a
letter
written
to
me
from
the
south
by
a
gentleman
who
still
resides
there
serves
to
show
how
true
it
is
that
on
every
occasion
the
colored
person
must
yield
to
the
white
and
especially
if
the
white
be
clothed
with
the
authority
of
an
ambassador
of
christ
a
negro
was
executed
in
autauga
not
long
since
for
the
murder
of
his
master
the
latter
it
seems
attempted
to
violate
the
wife
of
his
slave
in
his
presence
when
the
negro
enraged
smote
the
wretch
to
the
ground
and
this
master
this
brute
this
fiend
was
a
preacher
of
the
gospel
in
regular
standing
in
a
former
part
of
this
communication
i
said
enough
to
show
that
slavery
prevents
children
from
complying
with
the
command
to
obey
their
parents
but
in
reply
to
what
i
have
said
of
these
outrages
on
the
rights
of
husbands
and
wives
parents
and
children
you
maintain
that
they
are
no
part
of
the
system
of
slavery
slaveholders
however
being
themselves
judges
they
are
a
part
of
it
or
at
least
are
necessary
to
uphold
it
else
they
would
not
by
deliberate
solemn
legislation
authorize
them
but
be
this
as
it
may
it
is
abundantly
proven
that
slavery
is
essentially
and
inevitably
at
war
with
the
sacred
rights
of
the
family
state
let
me
say
then
in
conclusion
under
this
head
that
in
whatever
other
company
you
put
slavery
place
it
not
in
that
of
the
just
relations
of
husband
and
wife
parent
and
child
they
can
no
more
company
with
each
other
than
can
fire
with
water
their
natures
are
not
only
totally
opposite
to
but
destructive
of
each
other
the
laws
to
which
you
refer
on
the
page
of
your
book
tend
to
prove
and
so
far
as
your
admission
of
the
necessity
of
them
goes
do
prove
that
the
relation
of
slaveholder
and
slave
does
not
deserve
a
place
in
the
class
of
innocent
and
proper
relations
you
there
say
that
the
writings
of
such
great
and
good
men
as
wesley
edwards
porteus
paley
horsley
scott
clark
wilberforce
sharp
clarkson
fox
johnson
and
a
host
of
as
good
if
not
equally
great
men
of
later
date
have
made
it
necessary
for
the
safety
of
the
institution
of
slavery
to
pass
laws
forbidding
millions
of
our
countrymen
to
read
you
should
have
also
mentioned
the
horrid
sanctions
of
these
laws
stripes
imprisonment
and
death
now
these
laws
disable
the
persons
on
whom
they
bear
from
fulfilling
god
commandments
and
especially
his
commandment
to
search
the
scriptures
they
are
therefore
wicked
what
then
in
its
moral
character
must
be
a
relation
which
to
sustain
it
requires
the
aid
of
wicked
laws
and
how
entirely
out
of
place
must
it
be
when
you
class
it
with
those
just
relations
of
life
that
certainly
require
none
of
the
support
which
you
admit
is
indispensable
to
the
preservation
of
the
relation
of
slaveholder
and
slave
it
is
true
that
you
attempt
to
justify
the
enactment
of
the
laws
in
question
by
the
occasions
which
you
say
led
to
it
but
every
law
forbidding
what
god
requires
is
a
wicked
law
under
whatever
pretexts
or
for
whatever
purposes
it
may
have
been
enacted
let
the
occasions
which
lead
to
a
wicked
measure
be
what
they
may
the
wickedness
of
the
measure
is
still
sufficient
to
condemn
it
in
the
case
before
us
we
see
how
differently
different
persons
are
affected
by
the
same
fact
whilst
the
stand
taken
against
slavery
by
wesley
edwards
and
the
other
choice
spirits
you
enumerate
serves
but
to
inspire
you
with
concern
for
its
safety
it
would
of
itself
and
without
knowing
their
reasons
for
it
be
well
nigh
enough
to
destroy
my
confidence
in
the
institution
let
me
ask
you
sir
whether
it
would
not
be
more
reasonable
for
those
who
are
so
industriously
engaged
in
insulating
the
system
of
american
slavery
and
shrouding
it
with
darkness
to
find
less
fault
with
the
bright
and
burning
light
which
the
writings
of
the
wisest
and
best
men
pour
upon
it
and
more
with
the
system
which
hateth
the
light
neither
cometh
to
the
light
you
would
have
your
readers
believe
that
the
blessings
of
education
are
to
be
withheld
from
your
slaves
only
until
the
storm
shall
be
overblown
and
that
you
hope
that
satan
being
let
loose
will
be
but
for
a
little
season
i
say
nothing
more
about
the
last
expression
than
that
i
most
sincerely
desire
you
may
penitently
regret
having
attributed
the
present
holy
excitement
against
slavery
to
the
influences
of
satan
by
the
storm
you
doubtless
mean
the
excitement
produced
by
the
publications
and
efforts
of
the
american
society
now
i
will
not
suppose
that
you
meant
to
deceive
your
readers
on
this
point
you
are
nevertheless
inexcusable
for
using
language
so
strikingly
calculated
to
lead
them
into
error
it
is
not
yet
three
years
since
that
society
was
organized
but
the
statute
books
of
some
of
the
slave
states
contain
laws
forbidding
the
instruction
of
slaves
in
reading
which
were
enacted
long
before
you
and
i
were
born
as
long
ago
as
the
year
south
carolina
passed
a
law
forbidding
to
teach
slaves
to
write
georgia
did
so
in
in
the
year
years
before
the
storm
of
the
society
began
to
blow
south
carolina
passed
a
law
forbidding
assemblies
of
slaves
free
negroes
for
the
purpose
of
mental
instruction
in
the
revised
code
of
virginia
of
is
a
law
similar
to
that
last
mentioned
in
the
year
the
city
of
savannah
forbade
by
an
ordinance
the
instruction
of
all
persons
of
color
either
free
or
bond
in
reading
and
writing
i
need
not
specify
any
more
of
these
laws
nor
need
i
refer
again
to
the
shocking
penalties
annexed
to
the
violation
of
most
of
them
i
conclude
my
remarks
under
this
head
with
the
advice
that
in
the
next
edition
of
your
book
you
do
not
assign
the
excitement
which
is
now
spreading
over
our
land
as
the
occasion
of
the
passage
of
the
laws
in
question
the
only
other
reason
i
will
mention
for
believing
that
the
slavery
modification
of
servitude
is
not
approved
of
god
is
that
it
has
never
been
known
work
never
been
known
to
promote
happiness
or
god
glory
wickedness
and
wretchedness
are
so
uniformly
the
product
of
slavery
that
they
must
be
looked
upon
not
as
its
abuses
but
as
its
legitimate
fruits
whilst
all
admit
that
the
relations
of
the
family
state
are
notwithstanding
their
frequent
perversions
full
of
blessings
to
the
world
and
that
but
for
them
the
world
would
be
nothing
better
than
one
scene
of
pollution
and
wo
to
what
history
of
slavery
will
you
refer
me
for
proof
of
its
beneficent
operation
will
it
be
to
the
bible
history
of
egyptian
slavery
no
for
that
informs
us
of
the
exceeding
wickedness
and
wretchedness
of
egyptian
slavery
will
it
be
to
the
history
of
greek
and
roman
slavery
no
for
your
own
book
acknowledges
its
unutterable
horrors
and
abominations
will
you
refer
me
to
the
history
of
the
west
indies
for
proofs
of
the
happy
fruits
of
slavery
not
until
the
earth
is
no
more
will
its
polluted
and
bloody
pages
cease
to
testify
against
slavery
and
when
we
have
come
down
to
american
slavery
you
will
not
even
open
the
book
which
records
such
facts
as
that
its
subjects
are
forbidden
to
be
joined
in
wedlock
and
to
read
the
bible
no
you
will
not
presume
to
look
for
a
single
evidence
of
the
benign
influences
of
a
system
where
by
the
admission
of
your
own
ecclesiastical
bodies
it
has
turned
millions
of
men
into
heathen
i
say
nothing
now
of
your
beautiful
and
harmless
theories
of
slavery
but
this
i
say
that
when
you
look
upon
slavery
as
it
has
existed
or
now
exists
either
amidst
the
darkness
of
mahommedanism
or
the
light
of
christianity
you
dare
not
as
you
hope
for
the
divine
favor
say
that
it
is
a
institution
and
that
notwithstanding
it
is
like
ezekiel
roll
written
within
and
without
with
lamentations
and
mourning
and
wo
it
nevertheless
bears
the
mark
of
being
a
boon
from
god
to
man
having
disposed
of
your
strong
reasons
for
the
position
that
the
new
testament
authorizes
slavery
i
proceed
to
consider
your
remaining
reasons
for
it
because
it
does
not
appear
that
our
saviour
and
the
apostle
peter
told
certain
centurions
who
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
i
will
admit
were
slaveholders
that
slaveholding
is
sinful
you
argue
and
most
confidently
too
that
it
is
not
sinful
but
it
does
not
appear
that
the
saviour
and
the
apostle
charged
sinful
practices
upon
them
then
by
your
logic
all
their
other
practices
as
well
as
their
slaveholding
were
innocent
and
these
roman
soldiers
were
literally
again
how
do
you
know
that
the
saviour
and
the
apostle
did
not
tell
them
on
the
occasion
you
refer
to
that
they
were
sinners
for
being
slaveholders
the
fact
that
the
bible
does
not
inform
us
that
they
told
them
so
does
not
prove
that
they
did
not
much
less
does
it
prove
that
they
did
not
tell
them
so
subsequently
to
their
first
interview
with
them
and
again
the
admission
that
they
did
not
specifically
attack
slavery
at
any
of
their
interviews
with
the
centurions
or
on
any
other
occasions
whatever
would
not
justify
the
inference
that
it
is
sinless
i
need
not
repeat
the
reasoning
which
makes
the
truth
of
this
remark
apparent
you
refer
to
the
saviour
declaration
of
the
unequaled
faith
of
one
of
these
centurions
with
the
view
of
making
it
appear
that
a
person
of
so
great
faith
could
not
be
a
great
sinner
but
how
long
had
he
exercised
this
or
indeed
any
christian
faith
that
he
was
on
good
terms
with
the
jews
and
had
built
them
a
synagogue
is
quite
as
strong
evidence
that
he
had
not
as
that
he
had
previously
to
that
time
believed
in
jesus
and
if
he
had
not
then
his
faith
however
strong
and
his
conversion
however
decided
are
nothing
towards
proving
that
slavery
is
sinless
it
is
evident
that
the
apostle
was
sent
to
cornelius
for
the
single
purpose
of
inculcating
the
doctrine
of
the
remission
of
sin
through
faith
in
christ
i
proceed
to
examine
another
of
your
arguments
from
paul
declaration
to
the
elders
at
miletus
i
have
not
shunned
to
declare
unto
you
all
the
counsel
of
god
taken
in
connexion
with
the
fact
that
the
bible
does
not
inform
us
that
he
spoke
to
them
of
slaveholding
you
confidently
and
exultingly
infer
that
it
is
innocent
here
again
you
prove
too
much
and
therefore
prove
nothing
it
does
not
appear
that
he
specified
a
hundredth
part
of
their
duties
if
he
did
not
tell
them
to
abstain
from
slaveholding
neither
did
he
tell
them
to
abstain
from
games
and
theatres
but
his
silence
about
slaveholding
proves
to
your
mind
its
sinlessness
equally
then
should
his
silence
about
games
and
theatres
satisfy
you
of
their
innocence
two
radical
errors
run
through
a
great
part
of
your
book
they
are
that
the
apostle
gave
specific
instructions
concerning
all
duties
and
that
the
bible
contains
these
instructions
but
for
these
errors
your
book
would
be
far
less
objectionable
than
it
is
i
might
perhaps
rather
say
that
but
for
these
you
could
not
have
made
up
your
book
and
now
since
paul
address
to
the
elders
has
been
employed
by
you
in
behalf
of
slavery
allow
me
to
try
its
virtue
against
slavery
and
if
it
should
turn
out
that
you
are
slain
with
your
own
weapon
it
will
not
be
the
first
time
that
temerity
has
met
with
such
a
fate
i
admit
that
the
apostle
does
not
tell
the
elders
of
any
wrong
thing
which
they
had
done
but
there
are
some
wrong
things
from
which
he
had
himself
abstained
and
some
right
things
which
he
had
himself
done
of
which
he
does
tell
them
he
tells
them
for
instance
that
he
had
not
been
guilty
of
coveting
what
was
another
and
also
that
with
his
own
hands
he
had
ministered
to
his
own
necessities
and
those
of
others
and
he
further
tells
them
that
they
ought
to
copy
his
example
and
labor
as
he
had
done
to
support
the
weak
think
you
sir
from
this
language
that
paul
was
a
slaveholder
and
that
his
example
was
such
as
to
keep
lazy
luxurious
slaveholders
in
countenance
the
slaveholder
is
guilty
of
coveting
not
only
all
a
man
has
but
even
the
man
himself
the
slaveholder
will
not
only
not
labor
with
his
hands
to
supply
the
wants
of
others
and
to
support
the
weak
but
he
makes
others
labor
to
supply
his
wants
yes
makes
them
labor
unpaid
night
and
day
in
storm
as
well
as
in
sunshine
under
the
lash
bleeding
groaning
dying
and
all
this
not
to
minister
to
his
actual
needs
but
to
his
luxuriousness
and
sensuality
you
ridicule
the
idea
of
the
abolition
of
slavery
because
it
would
make
the
slaveholder
so
poor
as
to
oblige
him
to
take
hold
of
the
maul
and
wedge
himself
he
must
catch
curry
and
saddle
his
own
horse
he
must
black
his
own
brogans
for
he
will
not
be
able
to
buy
boots
his
wife
must
go
herself
to
the
take
hold
of
the
scrubbing
broom
wash
the
pots
and
cook
all
that
she
and
her
will
eat
if
paul
were
as
you
judge
he
was
opposed
to
the
abolition
of
slavery
it
is
at
least
certain
from
what
he
says
of
the
character
of
his
life
in
his
address
to
the
elders
that
his
opposition
did
not
spring
from
such
considerations
as
array
you
against
it
in
his
estimation
manual
labor
was
honorable
in
a
slaveholding
community
it
is
degrading
it
is
so
in
your
own
judgment
or
you
would
not
hold
up
to
ridicule
those
humble
employments
which
reflect
disgrace
only
where
the
moral
atmosphere
is
tainted
by
slavery
that
the
pernicious
influences
of
slavery
in
this
respect
are
felt
more
or
less
in
every
part
of
this
guilty
nation
is
but
too
true
i
put
it
to
your
candor
sir
whether
the
obvious
fact
that
slavery
makes
the
honest
labor
of
the
hands
disreputable
is
not
a
weighty
argument
against
the
supposition
that
god
approves
it
i
put
it
to
your
candor
sir
whether
the
fact
which
you
at
least
can
not
that
slavery
makes
even
ministers
of
the
gospel
despise
the
employments
of
of
the
human
family
and
consequently
the
humble
classes
who
labor
in
them
i
put
it
to
your
candor
whether
the
institution
which
breeds
such
contempt
of
your
and
fellow
christians
must
not
be
offensive
to
him
who
commands
us
to
honor
all
men
and
love
the
brotherhood
in
another
argument
you
attempt
to
show
that
paul
letter
to
philemon
justifies
slaveholding
and
also
the
apprehension
and
return
of
fugitive
slaves
after
having
recited
the
resolution
of
the
chilicothe
presbytery
that
to
apprehend
a
slave
who
is
endeavoring
to
escape
from
slavery
with
a
view
to
restore
him
to
his
master
is
a
direct
violation
of
the
divine
law
and
when
committed
by
a
member
of
the
church
ought
to
subject
him
to
censure
you
undertake
to
make
your
readers
believe
that
paul
sending
onesimus
to
philemon
is
a
case
coming
fairly
within
the
purview
of
the
resolution
let
us
see
if
it
does
a
man
by
the
name
of
onesimus
was
converted
to
christianity
under
paul
ministry
at
rome
paul
learnt
that
he
had
formerly
been
a
servant
say
a
slave
of
philemon
who
was
a
dearly
beloved
christian
and
believing
that
his
return
to
his
old
master
would
promote
the
cause
of
christ
and
beautifully
exemplify
its
power
he
advised
him
to
return
to
him
he
followed
the
apostle
advice
and
returned
now
from
this
example
you
attempt
to
derive
a
justification
for
a
member
of
a
church
to
be
engaged
in
forcibly
apprehending
and
restoring
fugitive
slaves
i
say
forcibly
as
the
apprehension
and
return
referred
to
in
the
resolution
are
clearly
forcible
i
can
not
refrain
sir
from
saying
that
you
greatly
wrong
the
memory
of
that
blessed
apostle
of
the
lord
jesus
in
construing
his
writings
to
authorize
such
violence
upon
the
persons
and
rights
of
men
and
greatly
also
do
you
wrong
the
resolution
in
question
by
your
endeavor
to
array
the
bible
against
it
the
resolution
is
right
it
is
noble
it
denotes
in
the
source
whence
it
emanated
a
proper
sense
of
the
rights
and
dignity
of
man
it
is
all
the
better
for
being
marked
with
an
honorable
contempt
of
wicked
and
laws
may
i
having
the
suspicion
or
even
the
certain
knowledge
that
my
fellow
man
was
once
held
in
slavery
and
is
still
a
slave
seize
upon
him
and
reduce
him
again
to
slavery
may
i
thus
deal
with
a
guiltless
and
unaccused
brother
human
laws
may
it
is
true
bear
me
out
in
this
which
is
not
less
flagrant
than
that
committed
on
the
coast
of
africa
but
says
the
great
the
word
that
i
have
spoken
the
same
shall
judge
him
in
the
last
day
and
it
is
a
part
of
this
word
that
he
that
stealeth
a
man
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
in
that
last
day
the
mayors
recorders
sheriffs
and
others
who
have
been
engaged
whether
in
their
official
or
individual
capacity
in
and
will
find
human
laws
but
a
flimsy
protection
against
the
wrath
of
him
who
judges
his
creatures
by
his
own
and
not
by
human
laws
in
that
last
day
all
who
have
had
a
part
and
have
not
repented
of
it
in
the
sin
of
treating
man
as
property
all
i
say
whether
slaveholders
or
their
official
or
unofficial
assistants
the
drivers
upon
their
plantations
or
their
drivers
in
the
free
states
all
who
have
been
guilty
of
throwing
god
image
into
the
same
class
with
the
brutes
of
the
field
will
find
that
he
is
the
avenger
of
his
poorest
meanest
ones
and
that
the
crime
of
transmuting
his
image
into
property
is
but
aggravated
by
the
fact
and
the
plea
that
it
was
committed
under
the
sanction
of
human
laws
but
to
return
wherein
does
the
letter
of
paul
to
philemon
justify
slaveholding
what
evidence
does
it
contain
that
philemon
was
a
slaveholder
at
the
time
it
was
written
he
who
had
been
his
slave
in
time
past
had
very
probably
escaped
before
philemon
conversion
to
christ
this
time
past
may
have
been
a
time
past
the
word
in
the
original
which
is
translated
in
time
past
does
not
forbid
the
supposition
indeed
it
is
the
same
word
which
the
apostle
uses
in
the
thirteenth
verse
of
the
first
chapter
of
galatians
and
there
it
denotes
a
time
past
as
much
as
from
fifteen
to
eighteen
years
besides
onesimus
escape
and
return
both
favor
the
supposition
that
it
was
between
the
two
events
that
philemon
conversion
took
place
on
the
one
hand
he
fled
to
escape
from
the
cruelties
of
an
unconverted
master
on
the
other
he
was
encouraged
to
follow
the
apostle
advice
by
the
consideration
that
on
his
return
to
philemon
he
should
not
have
to
encounter
again
the
unreasonableness
and
rage
of
a
heathen
but
that
he
should
meet
with
the
justice
and
tenderness
of
a
christian
qualities
with
the
existence
and
value
of
which
he
had
now
come
to
an
experimental
acquaintance
again
to
show
that
the
letter
in
question
does
not
justify
slaveholding
in
what
character
was
it
that
paul
sent
onesimus
to
philemon
was
it
in
that
of
a
slave
far
from
it
it
was
in
that
of
a
brother
beloved
as
is
evident
from
his
injunction
to
philemon
to
receive
him
forever
not
now
as
a
but
above
a
a
brother
beloved
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
paul
message
to
philemon
shows
not
only
that
he
himself
was
not
in
favor
of
slaveholding
but
that
he
believed
the
gospel
had
wrought
such
an
entire
change
on
this
subject
in
the
heart
of
philemon
that
onesimus
would
find
on
his
return
to
him
the
tyrant
and
the
slaveholder
sunk
in
the
brother
and
the
christian
paul
course
in
relation
to
onesimus
was
such
as
an
abolitionist
would
deem
it
proper
to
adopt
under
the
like
circumstances
if
a
fugitive
slave
who
had
become
a
dear
child
of
god
were
near
me
and
if
i
knew
that
his
once
cruel
master
had
also
become
a
dearly
beloved
christian
and
if
therefore
i
had
reason
to
believe
as
paul
had
in
the
case
of
philemon
that
he
would
receive
him
forever
not
now
as
a
but
above
a
a
brother
beloved
i
would
advise
him
to
revisit
his
old
master
provided
he
could
do
so
without
interference
and
violence
from
others
such
interference
and
violence
did
not
threaten
onesimus
in
his
return
to
philemon
he
was
not
in
danger
of
being
taken
up
imprisoned
and
sold
for
his
jail
fees
as
a
returning
onesimus
would
be
in
parts
of
this
nation
on
the
page
of
your
book
you
utter
sentiments
which
i
trust
all
your
readers
will
agree
are
unworthy
of
a
man
a
republican
and
a
christian
you
there
endeavor
again
to
make
it
appear
that
it
is
not
the
of
master
and
slave
but
only
the
abuse
of
it
which
is
to
be
objected
you
say
independence
is
a
charming
idea
especially
to
americans
but
what
gives
it
the
charm
is
it
the
thing
in
itself
or
is
it
because
it
is
a
release
from
the
control
of
a
bad
master
had
great
britain
been
a
kind
master
our
ancestors
were
willing
to
remain
her
slaves
in
reply
to
this
i
would
say
that
it
must
be
a
base
spirit
which
does
not
prize
independence
for
its
own
sake
whatever
privation
and
suffering
may
attend
it
and
much
more
base
must
be
that
spirit
which
can
exchange
that
independence
for
a
state
of
slavish
subjection
even
though
that
state
abound
in
all
sensual
gratifications
to
talk
of
a
kind
master
is
to
talk
of
a
blessing
for
a
dog
but
not
for
a
man
who
is
made
to
call
no
man
master
were
the
people
of
this
nation
like
yourself
they
would
soon
exchange
their
liberties
for
subjection
to
any
despot
who
would
promise
them
enough
to
eat
drink
and
wear
but
i
trust
that
we
at
the
north
are
made
of
sterner
stuff
they
who
make
slaves
of
others
can
more
easily
become
slaves
themselves
for
in
their
aggressions
upon
others
they
have
despised
and
trampled
under
foot
those
great
eternal
principles
of
right
which
constitute
the
bulwark
of
the
general
freedom
but
his
respect
for
which
is
indispensable
to
every
man
valuation
and
protection
of
his
individual
liberties
this
train
of
thought
associates
with
itself
in
my
mind
the
following
passage
in
an
admirable
speech
delivered
by
the
celebrated
william
pinckney
in
the
maryland
house
of
delegates
in
such
a
speech
made
at
the
present
time
in
a
slave
state
would
probably
cost
the
life
of
him
who
should
make
it
nor
could
it
be
delivered
in
a
free
states
at
any
less
sacrifice
certainly
than
that
of
the
reputation
of
the
orator
what
a
retrograde
movement
has
liberty
made
in
this
country
in
the
last
fifty
years
whilst
a
majority
of
your
citizens
are
accustomed
to
rule
with
the
authority
of
despots
within
particular
limits
while
your
youths
are
reared
in
the
habit
of
thinking
that
the
great
rights
of
human
nature
are
not
so
sacred
but
they
may
with
innocence
be
trampled
on
can
it
be
expected
that
the
public
mind
should
glow
with
that
generous
ardor
in
the
cause
of
freedom
which
can
alone
save
a
government
like
ours
from
the
lurking
demon
of
usurpation
do
you
not
dread
the
contamination
of
principle
have
you
no
alarms
for
the
continuance
of
that
spirit
which
once
conducted
us
to
victory
and
independence
when
the
talons
of
power
were
unclasped
for
our
destruction
have
you
no
apprehension
left
that
when
the
votaries
of
freedom
sacrifice
also
at
the
gloomy
altars
of
slavery
they
will
at
length
become
apostates
from
them
for
ever
for
my
own
part
i
have
no
hope
that
the
stream
of
general
liberty
will
flow
for
ever
unpolluted
through
the
foul
mire
of
partial
bondage
or
that
they
who
have
been
habituated
to
lord
it
over
others
will
not
be
base
enough
in
time
to
let
others
lord
it
over
them
if
they
resist
it
will
be
the
struggle
of
and
not
of
had
edmund
burke
known
slaveholders
as
well
as
pinckney
knew
them
he
would
not
have
pronounced
his
celebrated
eulogium
on
their
love
of
liberty
he
would
not
have
ascribed
to
them
any
love
of
liberty
but
the
spurious
kind
which
the
other
orator
impliedly
ascribes
to
them
that
which
pride
and
selfishness
beget
and
foster
genuine
love
of
liberty
as
pinckney
clearly
saw
springs
from
principle
and
is
found
no
where
but
in
the
hearts
of
those
who
respect
the
liberties
and
the
rights
of
others
i
had
reason
in
a
former
part
of
this
communication
to
charge
some
of
the
sentiments
of
professor
hodge
with
being
alike
reproachful
to
the
memory
of
our
fathers
and
pernicious
to
the
cause
of
civil
liberty
there
are
sentiments
on
the
page
of
your
book
obnoxious
to
the
like
charge
if
political
independence
if
a
free
government
be
the
poor
thing
the
illusive
image
of
an
american
brain
which
you
sneeringly
represent
it
we
owe
little
thanks
to
those
who
purchased
it
for
us
even
though
they
purchased
it
with
their
blood
and
little
pains
need
we
take
in
that
case
to
preserve
it
when
will
the
people
of
the
northern
states
see
that
the
doctrines
now
put
forth
so
industriously
to
maintain
slavery
are
rapidly
undermining
liberty
on
the
page
of
your
book
you
also
evince
your
low
estimate
of
rights
and
dues
you
there
say
the
fact
that
the
planters
of
mississippi
and
louisiana
even
while
they
have
to
pay
from
twenty
to
dollars
per
barrel
for
pork
the
present
season
afford
to
their
slaves
from
three
to
four
and
a
half
pounds
per
week
does
not
show
that
they
are
neglectful
in
rendering
to
their
slaves
that
which
is
just
and
equal
if
men
had
only
an
animal
and
not
a
spiritual
and
immortal
nature
also
it
might
do
for
you
to
represent
them
as
well
provided
for
if
but
pork
enough
were
flung
to
them
how
preposterous
to
tell
us
that
god
approves
a
system
which
brings
a
man
as
slavery
seems
to
have
brought
you
to
regard
his
fellow
man
as
a
mere
animal
i
am
happy
to
find
that
you
are
not
all
wrong
you
are
no
gradualist
you
are
not
inconsistent
like
those
who
admit
that
slavery
is
sinful
and
yet
refuse
to
treat
it
as
sinful
i
hope
our
northern
gradualists
will
profit
by
the
following
passage
in
your
book
if
i
were
convinced
by
that
word
the
bible
that
slavery
is
itself
a
sin
i
trust
that
let
it
cost
what
it
would
i
should
be
an
abolitionist
because
there
is
no
truth
more
clear
to
my
mind
than
that
the
gospel
requires
an
abandonment
of
sin
you
have
no
doubt
of
your
right
to
hold
your
fellow
men
as
slaves
i
wish
you
had
given
your
readers
more
fully
your
views
of
the
origin
of
this
right
i
judge
from
what
you
say
that
you
trace
it
back
to
the
curse
pronounced
by
noah
upon
canaan
but
was
that
curse
to
know
no
end
were
canaan
posterity
to
endure
the
entailment
of
its
disabilities
and
woes
until
the
end
of
time
was
divine
mercy
never
to
stay
the
desolating
waves
of
this
curse
was
their
harsh
and
angry
roar
to
reach
even
into
the
gospel
dispensation
and
to
mingle
discordantly
with
the
songs
of
peace
on
earth
and
good
will
to
men
was
the
captivity
of
canaan
race
to
be
even
stronger
than
he
who
came
to
bind
up
the
and
proclaim
liberty
to
the
captives
but
who
were
canaan
and
his
descendants
you
speak
of
them
and
with
singular
unfairness
i
think
as
posterity
of
ham
from
whom
it
is
supposed
sprang
the
africans
they
were
it
is
true
a
part
of
posterity
but
to
call
them
posterity
of
ham
is
to
speak
as
though
he
had
no
other
child
than
canaan
the
fifteenth
to
nineteenth
verses
of
the
tenth
chapter
of
genesis
teach
us
beyond
all
question
that
canaan
descendants
inhabited
the
land
of
canaan
and
adjacent
territory
and
that
this
land
is
identical
with
the
country
afterwards
occupied
by
the
jews
and
known
in
modern
times
by
the
name
of
palestine
or
the
holy
land
therefore
however
true
it
may
be
that
a
portion
of
ham
posterity
settled
in
africa
we
not
only
have
no
evidence
that
it
was
the
portion
cursed
but
we
have
conclusive
evidence
that
it
was
not
but
was
it
a
state
of
slavery
to
which
canaanites
were
doomed
i
will
suppose
for
a
moment
that
it
was
and
then
how
does
it
appear
right
to
enslave
them
the
curse
in
question
is
prophecy
now
prophecy
does
not
say
what
ought
to
come
to
pass
nor
does
it
say
that
they
who
have
an
agency
in
the
production
of
the
foretold
event
will
be
innocent
in
that
agency
if
the
prediction
of
an
event
justifies
those
who
are
instrumental
in
producing
it
then
was
judas
innocent
in
betraying
our
saviour
it
must
needs
be
that
offences
come
but
wo
to
that
man
by
whom
the
offence
cometh
prophecy
simply
tells
what
will
come
to
pass
the
question
whether
it
was
proper
to
enslave
canaanites
depends
for
its
solution
not
on
the
curse
or
prophecy
in
question
if
the
measure
were
in
conformity
with
the
general
morality
of
the
bible
then
it
was
proper
was
it
in
conformity
with
it
it
was
not
the
justice
equity
and
mercy
which
were
agreeable
to
the
divine
command
to
characterize
the
dealings
of
the
jews
with
each
other
are
in
such
conformity
and
these
are
all
violated
by
slavery
if
those
dealings
were
all
based
on
the
general
morality
of
the
bible
as
they
certainly
were
then
slavery
which
in
its
moral
character
is
completely
opposite
to
them
can
not
rest
on
that
morality
if
that
morality
did
not
permit
the
jews
to
enslave
canaanites
how
came
they
to
enslave
them
you
will
say
that
they
had
special
authority
from
god
to
do
so
in
the
words
both
thy
bondmen
and
thy
bondmaids
which
thou
shalt
have
shall
be
of
the
heathen
that
are
around
about
you
of
them
shall
ye
buy
bondmen
and
bondmaids
well
i
will
admit
that
god
did
in
one
instance
and
that
he
may
have
done
so
in
others
give
special
authority
to
the
jews
to
do
that
which
without
such
authority
would
have
been
palpably
and
grossly
immoral
he
required
them
to
exterminate
some
of
the
tribes
of
the
canaanites
he
may
have
required
them
to
bring
other
heathens
under
a
form
of
servitude
violative
of
the
general
morality
of
his
of
course
no
blame
attaches
to
the
execution
of
such
commands
when
he
specially
deputes
us
to
kill
for
him
we
are
as
innocent
in
the
agency
notwithstanding
the
general
law
thou
shalt
not
kill
as
is
the
earthquake
or
thunderbolt
when
commissioned
to
destroy
samuel
was
as
innocent
in
hewing
agag
in
pieces
as
is
the
tree
that
falls
upon
the
traveler
it
may
be
remarked
in
this
connexion
that
the
fact
that
god
gave
a
special
statute
to
destroy
some
of
the
tribes
of
the
canaanites
argues
the
contrariety
of
the
thing
required
to
the
morality
of
the
bible
it
argues
that
this
morality
would
not
have
secured
the
accomplishment
of
what
was
required
by
the
statute
indeed
it
is
probable
that
it
was
sometimes
under
the
influence
of
the
tenderness
and
mercy
inculcated
by
this
morality
that
the
jews
were
guilty
of
going
counter
to
the
special
statute
in
question
and
sparing
the
devoted
canaanites
as
in
the
instance
when
they
spared
agag
we
might
reason
similarly
to
show
that
a
special
statute
if
indeed
there
were
such
a
one
authorizing
the
jews
to
compel
the
heathen
to
serve
them
argues
that
compulsory
service
is
contrary
to
fundamental
morality
we
will
suppose
that
god
did
in
the
special
statute
referred
to
clothe
the
jews
with
power
to
enslave
heathens
and
now
let
me
ask
you
whether
it
is
by
this
same
statute
to
enslave
that
you
justify
your
neighbors
and
yourself
for
enslaving
your
fellow
men
but
this
is
a
special
statute
conferring
a
power
on
the
jews
only
a
power
too
not
to
enslave
whomsoever
they
could
but
only
a
specified
portion
of
the
human
family
and
this
portion
as
we
have
seen
of
a
stock
other
than
that
from
which
you
have
obtained
your
slaves
if
the
special
statutes
by
which
god
clothed
the
jews
with
peculiar
powers
may
be
construed
to
clothe
you
with
similar
powers
then
inasmuch
as
they
were
authorized
and
required
to
kill
canaanites
you
may
hunt
up
for
destruction
the
straggling
descendants
of
such
of
the
devoted
ones
as
escaped
the
sword
of
the
jews
or
to
make
a
different
interpretation
of
your
rights
under
this
supposition
since
the
statute
in
question
authorized
and
required
the
jews
to
kill
the
heathen
within
the
borders
of
what
was
properly
the
jews
country
then
you
are
also
authorized
and
required
to
kill
the
heathens
within
the
limits
of
your
country
and
these
are
not
wanting
if
the
testimony
of
your
ecclesiastical
bodies
before
referred
to
can
be
relied
on
and
if
it
be
as
they
say
that
the
millions
of
the
poor
colored
brethren
in
the
midst
of
you
are
made
heathens
by
the
operation
of
the
system
to
which
with
unparalleled
wickedness
they
are
subjected
if
then
neither
noah
curse
nor
the
special
statute
in
question
authorize
you
to
enslave
your
fellow
men
there
is
probably
but
one
ground
on
which
you
will
contend
for
authority
to
do
so
and
this
is
the
ground
of
the
general
morality
of
the
christian
religion
of
the
general
principles
of
right
and
duty
in
the
word
of
god
do
you
find
your
authority
on
this
ground
if
you
do
then
manifestly
you
have
a
right
to
enslave
me
and
i
a
right
to
enslave
you
and
every
man
has
a
right
to
enslave
whomsoever
he
can
a
right
as
perfect
as
is
the
right
to
do
good
to
one
another
indeed
the
enslavement
of
each
other
would
under
this
construction
of
duty
the
doing
of
good
to
one
another
think
you
sir
that
the
universal
exercise
of
this
right
would
promote
the
fulfilment
of
the
new
commandment
that
ye
love
one
another
think
you
it
would
be
the
harbinger
of
millenial
peace
and
blessedness
or
think
you
not
rather
that
it
would
fully
and
frightfully
realize
the
prophet
declaration
they
all
lie
in
wait
for
blood
they
hunt
every
man
his
neighbor
with
a
net
if
any
people
have
a
right
to
enslave
their
fellow
men
it
must
be
the
jews
if
they
once
had
it
but
if
they
ever
had
it
it
ceased
when
all
their
peculiar
rights
ceased
in
respect
to
rights
from
the
most
high
they
are
now
on
the
same
footing
with
other
races
of
men
when
the
vail
of
the
temple
was
rent
in
twain
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
then
that
distinction
from
the
gentile
in
which
the
jew
had
gloried
ceased
and
the
partition
wall
between
them
was
prostrate
for
ever
the
jew
as
well
as
the
gentile
was
never
more
to
depart
from
the
general
morality
of
the
bible
he
was
never
again
to
be
under
any
special
statutes
whose
requirements
should
bring
him
into
collision
with
that
morality
he
was
no
more
to
confine
his
sympathies
and
friendships
within
the
narrow
range
of
the
twelve
tribes
but
every
son
and
daughter
of
adam
were
thenceforth
entitled
to
claim
from
him
the
heart
and
hand
of
a
brother
under
the
glorious
dispensation
of
the
gospel
says
the
immortal
granville
sharp
we
are
absolutely
bound
to
consider
ourselves
as
citizens
of
the
world
every
man
whatever
without
any
partial
distinction
of
nation
distance
or
complexion
must
necessarily
be
esteemed
our
neighbor
and
our
brother
and
we
are
absolutely
bound
in
christian
duty
to
entertain
a
disposition
towards
all
mankind
as
charitable
and
benevolent
at
least
as
that
which
was
required
of
the
jews
under
the
law
towards
their
brethren
and
consequently
it
is
absolutely
unlawful
for
those
who
call
themselves
christians
to
exact
of
their
brethren
i
mean
their
brethren
of
the
universe
a
more
burthensome
service
than
that
to
which
the
jews
were
limited
with
respect
to
their
brethren
of
the
house
of
israel
and
the
slavery
or
involuntary
bondage
of
a
brother
israelite
was
absolutely
forbid
it
occurs
to
me
that
after
all
which
has
been
said
to
satisfy
you
that
compulsory
servitude
if
such
there
were
among
the
jews
can
not
properly
be
pleaded
in
justification
of
yours
a
question
may
still
be
floating
in
your
mind
whether
if
god
directed
his
chosen
people
to
enslave
the
heathen
slavery
should
not
be
regarded
as
a
good
system
of
servitude
just
as
pertinently
may
you
ask
whether
that
is
not
a
good
system
of
servitude
which
is
found
in
some
of
our
state
prisons
punishment
probably
certainly
not
labor
is
the
leading
object
in
the
one
case
as
well
as
the
other
and
the
labor
of
the
bondman
in
the
one
as
well
as
of
the
convict
in
the
other
constitutes
but
a
subordinate
consideration
to
suppose
that
god
would
with
every
consideration
out
of
view
but
that
of
having
the
best
relation
of
employer
and
laborer
make
choice
of
slavery
to
suppose
that
he
believes
that
this
state
of
servitude
operates
most
beneficially
both
for
the
master
and
the
servant
is
a
high
impeachment
of
the
divine
wisdom
and
goodness
but
thus
guilty
are
you
if
you
are
unwilling
to
believe
that
if
he
chose
the
severe
servitude
in
question
he
chose
it
for
the
punishment
of
his
enemies
or
from
some
consideration
other
than
its
suitableness
for
the
ordinary
purposes
of
the
relation
of
master
and
servant
but
it
has
been
for
the
sake
of
argument
only
that
i
have
admitted
that
god
authorized
the
jews
to
enslave
the
heathen
i
now
totally
deny
that
he
did
so
you
will
of
course
consent
that
if
he
did
so
it
was
in
a
special
statute
as
was
the
case
when
he
authorized
them
to
exterminate
other
heathen
and
you
will
as
readily
consent
that
he
enacted
the
statutes
in
both
instances
with
the
view
of
punishing
his
enemies
now
in
killing
the
canaanites
the
jew
was
constituted
not
the
owner
of
his
devoted
fellow
man
but
simply
the
executioner
of
vengeance
and
evidently
such
and
no
other
was
his
character
when
he
was
reducing
the
canaanite
to
involuntary
servitude
that
he
did
so
reduce
him
and
was
commissioned
by
god
to
do
so
is
the
supposition
we
make
for
the
sake
of
argument
had
the
jews
been
authorized
by
god
to
shut
up
in
dungeons
for
life
those
of
the
heathen
whom
they
were
directed
to
have
for
bondmen
and
bondmaids
you
would
not
claim
that
they
any
more
than
sheriffs
and
jailers
in
our
day
are
to
be
considered
in
the
light
of
owners
of
the
persons
in
their
charge
much
less
then
can
the
jews
be
considered
as
the
owners
of
any
person
whom
they
held
in
servitude
for
however
severe
the
type
of
that
servitude
the
liberty
of
its
subject
was
not
restricted
as
was
that
of
the
prisoners
in
question
most
certainly
the
power
asserted
over
him
is
not
to
be
compared
in
extent
with
that
asserted
by
the
jew
over
the
canaanite
whom
he
slew
a
case
in
which
he
was
indisputably
but
the
executioner
of
the
divine
wrath
the
canaanite
whether
devoted
to
a
violent
death
or
to
an
involuntary
servitude
still
remained
the
property
of
god
and
god
no
more
gave
him
up
to
be
the
property
of
the
executioner
of
his
wrath
than
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york
give
up
the
offender
against
public
justice
to
be
the
property
of
the
ministers
of
that
justice
god
never
suspends
the
accountability
of
his
rational
creatures
to
himself
and
his
rights
to
them
he
never
transfers
to
others
he
could
not
do
so
consistently
with
his
attributes
and
his
indissoluble
relations
to
man
but
slavery
claims
that
its
subjects
are
the
property
of
man
it
claims
to
turn
them
into
mere
chattels
and
to
make
them
as
void
of
responsibility
to
god
as
other
chattels
slavery
in
a
word
claims
to
push
from
his
throne
the
supreme
being
who
declares
all
souls
are
mine
that
it
does
not
succeed
in
getting
its
victim
out
of
god
hand
and
in
unmanning
and
him
that
god
hold
upon
him
remains
unbroken
and
that
those
upward
tendencies
of
the
soul
which
distinguish
man
from
the
brute
are
not
yet
entirely
crushed
in
him
is
no
evidence
in
favor
of
its
nature
it
simply
proves
that
its
power
is
not
equal
to
its
purposes
we
see
then
that
the
jews
if
it
be
true
that
they
reduced
their
fellow
men
to
involuntary
servitude
and
did
so
as
the
ministers
of
god
justice
are
not
to
be
charged
with
slaveholding
for
it
there
may
be
involuntary
servitude
where
there
is
no
slavery
the
essential
and
distinguishing
feature
of
slavery
is
its
reduction
of
man
to
property
to
a
thing
a
tenant
of
one
of
our
state
prisons
is
under
a
sentence
of
hard
labor
for
life
but
he
is
not
a
slave
that
is
he
is
not
the
which
slavery
would
mark
its
subject
he
is
still
a
man
offended
justice
has
placed
him
in
his
present
circumstances
because
he
is
a
man
and
it
is
because
he
is
a
and
not
a
a
responsible
and
not
an
irresponsible
being
that
he
must
continue
in
his
present
trials
and
sufferings
god
commandments
to
the
jews
respecting
servants
and
strangers
show
that
he
not
only
did
not
authorize
them
to
set
up
the
claim
of
property
in
their
fellow
men
but
that
he
most
carefully
guarded
against
such
exercises
of
power
as
might
lead
to
the
assumption
of
a
claim
so
wrongful
to
himself
some
of
these
commandments
i
will
bring
to
your
notice
they
show
that
whatever
was
the
form
of
servitude
under
which
god
allowed
the
jews
to
hold
the
heathen
it
was
not
slavery
indeed
if
all
of
the
word
of
god
which
bears
on
this
point
were
cited
and
duly
explained
it
would
perhaps
appear
that
he
allowed
no
involuntary
servitude
whatever
amongst
the
jews
i
give
no
opinion
whether
he
allowed
it
or
not
there
are
strong
arguments
which
go
to
show
that
he
did
not
allow
it
and
with
these
arguments
the
public
will
soon
be
made
more
extensively
acquainted
it
is
understood
that
the
next
number
of
the
examiner
will
be
filled
with
them
so
galling
are
the
bonds
of
southern
slavery
that
it
could
not
live
a
year
under
the
operation
of
a
law
forbidding
the
restoration
of
fugitive
servants
to
their
masters
how
few
of
the
discontented
subjects
of
this
oppressive
servitude
would
agree
with
hamlet
that
it
is
better
to
bear
those
ills
we
have
than
fly
to
others
that
we
know
not
of
what
a
running
there
would
be
from
the
slave
states
to
the
free
from
one
slave
state
to
another
from
one
plantation
to
another
now
such
a
law
a
solemn
commandment
of
god
many
writers
on
slavery
are
of
the
opinion
perhaps
too
confident
opinion
was
in
force
in
the
jewish
nation
deut
xxiii
and
yet
the
system
of
servitude
on
which
it
bore
and
which
you
cite
as
the
pattern
and
authority
for
your
own
lived
in
spite
of
it
how
could
it
manifestly
because
its
genius
was
wholly
unlike
that
of
southern
slavery
and
because
its
rigors
and
wrongs
if
rigors
and
wrongs
there
were
in
it
bear
no
comparison
to
those
which
characterize
southern
slavery
and
which
would
impel
of
its
adult
subjects
to
fly
from
their
homes
did
they
but
know
that
they
would
not
be
obliged
to
return
to
them
when
southern
slaveholders
shall
cease
to
scour
the
land
for
fugitive
servants
and
to
hunt
them
with
guns
and
dogs
and
to
imprison
and
scourge
and
kill
them
when
in
a
word
they
shall
subject
to
the
bearing
of
such
a
law
as
that
referred
to
their
system
of
servitude
then
we
shall
begin
to
think
that
they
are
sincere
in
likening
it
to
the
systems
which
existed
among
the
jews
the
law
enacted
in
virginia
in
authorizing
any
two
justices
of
the
peace
by
proclamation
to
runaways
who
might
thereafter
be
killed
and
destroyed
by
any
person
whatsoever
by
such
ways
and
means
as
he
might
think
fit
without
accusation
or
impeachment
of
any
crime
for
so
doing
besides
that
it
justifies
what
i
have
just
said
about
hunting
fugitive
servants
shows
that
the
american
society
is
of
too
recent
an
origin
to
be
the
occasion
as
slaveholders
and
their
apologists
would
have
us
believe
of
all
the
cruel
laws
enacted
at
the
south
that
southern
slaveholders
would
be
very
unwilling
to
have
their
system
come
under
the
operation
of
such
a
law
as
that
which
allowed
the
jewish
servant
to
change
his
master
that
they
are
monsters
indeed
into
which
men
may
be
turned
by
their
possession
of
absolute
power
you
perhaps
suppose
and
i
frankly
admit
to
you
that
there
is
some
room
for
the
supposition
that
the
servants
referred
to
in
the
and
verses
of
the
chapter
of
deuteronomy
were
such
as
had
escaped
from
foreign
countries
to
the
country
of
the
jews
but
would
this
view
of
the
matter
help
you
by
taking
it
would
you
not
expose
yourself
to
be
most
pertinently
and
embarrassingly
asked
for
what
purpose
these
servants
fled
to
a
strange
and
most
odious
people
and
would
not
your
candid
reply
necessarily
be
that
it
was
to
escape
from
the
galling
chains
of
slavery
to
a
milder
type
of
servitude
from
gentile
oppression
to
a
land
in
which
human
rights
were
protected
by
divine
laws
but
as
i
have
previously
intimated
i
have
not
the
strongest
confidence
in
the
argument
so
frequently
drawn
from
this
passage
of
the
bible
i
am
not
sure
that
a
jewish
servant
is
referred
to
nor
that
on
the
supposition
of
his
being
a
foreigner
the
servant
came
under
any
form
of
servitude
when
entering
the
land
of
the
jews
before
leaving
the
topic
however
let
me
remark
that
the
passage
under
any
construction
of
it
makes
against
southern
slavery
admit
that
the
fugitive
servant
was
a
foreigner
and
that
he
was
not
reduced
to
servitude
on
coming
among
the
jews
let
me
ask
you
whether
the
law
in
question
under
this
view
of
it
would
be
tolerated
by
the
spirit
of
southern
slavery
and
whether
before
obedience
would
be
rendered
to
it
you
would
not
need
to
have
a
different
type
of
servitude
in
the
place
of
slavery
you
would
i
know
you
would
for
you
have
been
put
to
the
trial
when
by
a
happy
providence
a
vessel
was
driven
the
last
year
to
a
west
india
island
and
the
chains
of
the
poor
slaves
with
which
it
was
filled
fell
from
around
them
under
freedom
magic
power
the
exasperated
south
was
ready
to
go
to
war
with
great
britain
the
law
against
delivering
up
foreign
servants
to
their
masters
was
not
relished
by
you
the
given
case
comes
most
strikingly
within
the
supposed
policy
of
this
law
the
gentile
was
to
be
permitted
to
remain
in
the
land
to
which
he
had
fled
and
where
he
would
have
advantages
for
becoming
acquainted
with
the
god
of
the
bible
such
advantages
are
they
enjoying
who
escaped
from
the
confessed
heathenism
of
southern
slavery
to
the
island
in
question
they
are
now
taught
to
read
that
book
of
life
which
before
they
were
forbidden
to
read
but
again
suppose
a
slave
were
to
escape
from
a
west
india
island
into
the
southern
states
would
you
with
your
domestic
institutions
of
which
you
are
so
jealous
render
obedience
to
this
divine
law
no
you
would
subject
him
to
a
servitude
more
severe
than
that
from
which
he
had
escaped
indeed
if
a
come
within
a
certain
portion
of
our
southern
country
and
be
so
unhappy
as
to
bear
a
physical
resemblance
to
the
slave
he
will
be
punished
for
that
resemblance
by
imprisonment
and
even
by
a
reduction
to
slavery
southern
slaveholders
who
by
their
laws
own
men
as
absolutely
as
they
own
cattle
would
have
it
believed
that
jewish
masters
thus
owned
their
if
they
did
why
was
there
so
wide
a
difference
between
the
commandment
respecting
the
stray
man
and
that
respecting
the
stray
ox
or
ass
the
man
was
not
but
the
beasts
were
to
be
returned
and
that
too
even
though
their
owner
was
the
enemy
of
him
who
met
them
ex
i
repeat
the
question
why
this
difference
the
only
answer
is
because
god
made
the
brute
to
be
the
of
man
but
he
never
gave
us
our
noble
nature
for
such
degradation
man
title
deed
in
the
eighth
psalm
extends
his
right
of
property
to
the
inanimate
and
brute
creation
only
not
to
the
flesh
and
bones
and
spirit
of
his
the
very
different
penalties
annexed
to
the
crime
of
stealing
a
man
and
to
that
of
stealing
a
thing
shows
the
eternal
and
infinite
difference
which
god
has
established
between
a
man
and
property
the
stealing
of
a
man
was
to
be
punished
with
death
whilst
mere
property
was
allowed
to
atone
for
the
offence
of
stealing
property
who
if
not
the
slave
can
be
said
to
be
vexed
and
oppressed
but
god
command
to
his
people
was
that
they
should
neither
vex
a
stranger
nor
oppress
him
such
is
the
nature
of
american
slavery
that
not
even
its
warmest
friends
would
claim
that
it
could
recover
itself
after
such
a
year
of
jubilee
as
god
appointed
one
such
general
delivery
of
its
victims
would
be
for
ever
fatal
to
it
i
am
aware
that
you
deny
that
all
the
servants
of
the
jews
shared
in
the
blessings
of
the
year
of
jubilee
but
let
me
ask
you
whether
if
one
third
or
one
half
of
your
servants
were
discharged
from
servitude
every
fiftieth
year
and
still
more
whether
if
a
considerable
proportion
of
them
were
thus
discharged
every
sixth
year
the
remainder
would
not
be
fearfully
discontented
southern
masters
believe
that
their
only
safety
consists
in
keeping
down
the
discontent
of
their
servants
hence
their
anxious
care
to
withhold
from
them
the
knowledge
of
human
rights
hence
the
abolitionist
who
is
caught
in
a
slave
state
must
be
whipped
or
put
to
death
if
there
were
a
class
of
servants
amongst
the
jews
who
could
bear
to
see
all
their
fellow
servants
go
free
whilst
they
themselves
were
retained
in
bondage
then
that
bondage
was
of
a
kind
very
different
from
what
you
suppose
it
to
have
been
had
its
subjects
worn
the
galling
chains
of
american
slavery
they
would
have
struggled
with
bloody
desperation
for
the
deliverance
which
they
saw
accorded
to
others
i
scarcely
need
say
that
the
hebrew
words
rendered
bondmen
and
bondmaids
do
not
in
themselves
considered
and
independently
of
the
connexion
in
which
they
are
used
any
more
than
the
greek
words
and
denote
a
particular
kind
of
servant
if
the
servant
was
a
slave
because
he
was
called
by
the
hebrew
word
rendered
bondman
then
was
jacob
a
slave
also
and
even
still
greater
absurdities
could
be
deduced
from
the
position
i
promised
in
a
former
part
of
this
communication
to
give
you
my
reasons
for
denying
that
you
are
at
liberty
to
plead
in
behalf
of
slavery
the
example
of
any
compulsory
servitude
in
which
jews
may
have
held
foreigners
my
promise
is
now
fulfilled
and
i
trust
that
the
reasons
are
such
as
not
to
admit
of
an
answer
driven
as
you
now
are
from
every
other
conceivable
defence
of
slaveholding
it
may
be
though
i
must
hope
better
things
of
you
that
you
will
fly
to
the
ground
taken
by
the
wicked
multitude
that
there
is
authority
in
the
laws
of
man
for
being
a
slaveholder
but
not
only
is
the
sin
of
your
holding
slaves
undiminished
by
the
consideration
that
they
are
held
under
human
laws
but
your
claiming
to
hold
them
under
such
laws
makes
you
guilty
of
an
additional
sin
which
if
measured
by
its
pernicious
consequences
to
others
is
by
no
means
inconsiderable
the
truth
of
these
two
positions
is
apparent
from
the
following
considerations
there
is
no
valid
excuse
to
be
found
either
in
man
laws
or
any
where
else
for
transgressing
god
laws
whatever
may
be
thought
or
said
to
the
contrary
it
still
remains
and
for
ever
will
remain
true
that
under
all
circumstances
sin
is
the
transgression
of
the
divine
law
in
every
instance
in
which
a
commandment
of
god
is
transgressed
under
the
cover
and
plea
of
a
human
law
purporting
to
permit
what
that
commandment
forbids
there
is
in
proportion
to
the
authority
and
influence
of
the
transgressor
a
fresh
sanction
imparted
to
that
law
and
consequently
in
the
same
proportion
the
public
habit
of
setting
up
a
false
standard
of
right
and
wrong
is
promoted
it
is
this
habit
this
habit
of
graduating
our
morality
by
the
laws
of
the
land
in
which
we
live
that
makes
the
mischief
framed
by
a
law
so
much
more
pernicious
than
that
which
has
no
law
to
countenance
it
and
to
commend
it
to
the
conscience
who
is
unaware
that
nothing
tends
so
powerfully
to
keep
the
traffic
in
strong
drink
from
becoming
universally
odious
as
the
fact
that
this
body
and
soul
destroying
business
finds
a
sanction
in
human
laws
who
has
not
seen
the
man
authorized
by
these
laws
to
distribute
the
poison
amongst
his
tippling
neighbors
proof
against
all
the
shafts
of
truth
under
the
and
consideration
that
his
is
a
lawful
business
this
habit
of
setting
up
man
law
instead
of
god
law
as
the
standard
of
conduct
is
strikingly
manifested
in
the
fact
that
on
the
ground
that
the
federal
constitution
binds
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
to
perpetuate
slavery
or
at
least
not
to
meddle
with
it
we
are
both
at
the
north
and
the
south
called
on
to
forbear
from
all
efforts
to
abolish
it
the
exertions
made
to
discover
in
that
instrument
authority
for
slavery
and
authority
against
endeavors
to
abolish
it
are
as
great
anxious
and
unwearied
as
if
they
who
made
them
thought
that
the
fortunate
discovery
would
settle
for
ever
the
great
question
which
agitates
our
country
would
nullify
all
the
laws
of
god
against
slavery
and
make
the
oppression
of
our
colored
brethren
as
long
as
time
shall
last
justifiable
and
praiseworthy
but
this
discovery
will
never
be
made
for
the
constitution
is
not
on
the
side
of
the
slaveholder
if
it
were
however
it
would
clothe
him
with
no
moral
right
to
act
in
opposition
to
the
paramount
law
of
god
it
is
not
at
all
necessary
to
the
support
of
my
views
in
this
communication
to
show
that
the
constitution
was
not
designed
to
favor
slavery
and
yet
a
few
words
to
this
end
may
not
be
out
of
place
a
treaty
between
great
britain
and
turkey
by
the
terms
of
which
the
latter
should
be
prohibited
from
allowing
slaves
to
be
brought
within
her
dominions
after
twenty
years
from
its
date
would
all
will
admit
redound
greatly
to
the
credit
of
great
britain
to
be
sure
she
would
not
have
done
as
much
for
the
cause
of
humanity
as
if
she
had
succeeded
in
bringing
the
further
indulgence
of
the
sin
within
the
limits
of
a
briefer
period
and
incomparably
less
than
if
she
had
succeeded
in
reconciling
the
sublime
porte
to
her
glorious
and
emphatically
english
doctrines
of
immediate
emancipation
but
still
she
would
deserve
some
praise
much
more
than
if
she
had
done
nothing
in
this
respect
now
for
my
present
purpose
and
many
of
our
statesmen
say
for
nearly
all
purposes
the
federal
constitution
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
treaty
between
sovereign
states
but
how
much
more
does
this
treaty
do
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
than
that
on
which
we
were
a
moment
since
bestowing
our
praise
it
imposes
a
prohibition
similar
to
that
in
the
supposed
treaty
between
great
britain
and
turkey
so
that
no
slaves
have
been
allowed
to
be
introduced
into
the
united
states
since
the
year
it
goes
further
and
makes
ample
provision
for
the
abolition
and
prevention
of
slavery
in
every
part
of
the
nation
save
these
states
so
that
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
national
territories
can
be
cleared
forever
of
slavery
whenever
a
majority
of
the
parties
bound
by
the
treaty
shall
desire
it
and
it
goes
still
farther
and
clothes
this
majority
with
the
power
of
regulating
commerce
between
the
states
and
consequently
of
prohibiting
their
mutual
traffic
in
the
bodies
and
souls
of
men
had
this
treaty
gone
but
one
step
farther
and
made
an
exception
as
it
should
have
done
in
behalf
of
slaves
in
the
clause
making
necessary
provision
for
the
return
of
fugitives
held
to
service
in
the
states
from
which
they
flee
none
but
those
who
think
it
is
fairly
held
responsible
for
the
twenty
years
indulgence
of
the
unholy
traffic
would
have
claimed
any
thing
more
from
it
in
relation
to
slavery
now
this
instrument
which
contains
nothing
more
bearing
on
the
subject
of
slavery
than
what
i
have
referred
to
and
whose
pages
are
not
once
polluted
with
the
words
slave
and
slavery
is
abundantly
and
triumphantly
cited
as
conclusive
authority
in
favor
of
slavery
and
against
endeavors
to
abolish
it
whilst
we
regret
that
the
sons
of
freedom
in
the
convention
which
formed
it
could
obtain
no
more
concessions
from
the
advocates
of
slavery
let
us
honor
their
sacred
memory
and
thank
god
for
those
they
did
obtain
i
have
supposed
it
possible
that
you
might
number
yourself
with
those
who
defend
slavery
on
the
ground
of
its
alleged
conformity
with
human
laws
it
occurs
to
me
that
you
may
also
take
hope
that
slavery
is
defensible
in
the
supposed
fact
that
a
considerable
share
of
the
professing
christians
in
the
free
states
are
in
favor
of
it
let
god
be
true
but
every
man
a
liar
if
all
professing
christians
were
for
slavery
yet
if
god
is
against
it
that
is
reason
enough
why
you
also
should
be
against
it
it
is
not
true
however
that
a
considerable
share
of
our
professing
christians
are
on
the
side
of
slavery
indeed
until
i
read
professor
hodge
article
i
had
not
supposed
that
any
of
them
denied
its
sinfulness
it
is
true
that
a
large
proportion
of
them
refuse
to
take
a
stand
against
it
let
them
justify
to
their
consciences
and
to
their
god
as
they
can
the
equivocal
silence
and
still
more
equivocal
action
on
this
subject
by
which
they
have
left
their
southern
brethren
to
infer
that
northern
piety
sanctions
slavery
it
is
the
doctrine
of
expediency
so
prevalent
and
corrupting
in
the
american
church
which
has
deceived
you
into
the
belief
that
a
large
share
of
the
professing
christians
in
the
free
states
think
slavery
to
be
sinless
this
share
which
you
have
in
your
eye
is
as
well
as
the
remainder
convinced
that
slavery
is
sinful
they
think
it
inexpedient
to
say
in
relation
to
other
sins
they
are
satisfied
with
god
way
of
immediate
abandonment
but
in
relation
to
slavery
they
flatter
themselves
that
they
have
discovered
a
more
excellent
way
that
of
leaving
the
sin
untouched
and
simply
hoping
for
its
cessation
at
some
indefinite
period
in
the
distant
future
i
say
hoping
instead
of
praying
as
prayer
for
an
object
is
found
to
be
accompanied
by
corresponding
efforts
but
for
this
vile
doctrine
of
expediency
which
gives
to
our
ecclesiastical
bodies
whenever
the
subject
of
such
a
giant
and
popular
sin
as
slavery
is
broached
in
them
the
complexion
of
a
political
caucus
steeped
in
unprincipled
policy
rather
than
that
of
a
company
of
the
saviour
disciples
inquiring
in
simplicity
and
godly
sincerity
not
with
fleshly
wisdom
the
way
of
the
lord
but
for
this
doctrine
i
say
you
would
long
ago
have
heard
the
testimony
of
northern
christians
against
southern
slavery
and
not
only
so
but
you
would
long
ago
have
seen
this
dagon
fall
before
the
power
of
that
testimony
i
trust
however
that
this
testimony
will
not
long
be
withheld
and
that
northern
christians
will
soon
perceive
that
in
relation
to
slavery
as
well
as
every
other
sin
it
is
the
safest
and
wisest
as
well
as
the
holiest
course
to
drop
all
carnal
policy
to
trust
in
the
lord
with
all
thine
heart
and
lean
not
unto
thine
own
understanding
not
only
are
northern
christians
with
very
rare
exceptions
convinced
of
the
sin
of
slavery
but
even
your
slaveholders
were
formerly
accustomed
with
nearly
as
great
unanimity
to
admit
that
they
themselves
thought
it
to
be
sinful
it
is
only
recently
and
since
they
have
found
that
their
system
must
be
tested
by
the
bible
thoroughly
and
in
earnest
not
merely
for
the
purpose
as
formerly
of
determining
without
any
practical
consequences
of
the
determination
what
is
the
moral
character
of
slavery
but
for
the
purpose
of
settling
the
point
whether
the
institution
shall
stand
or
fall
it
is
only
i
say
since
the
civilized
world
has
been
fast
coming
to
claim
that
it
shall
be
decided
by
the
bible
and
by
no
lower
standard
whether
slavery
shall
or
shall
not
exist
that
your
slaveholders
have
found
it
expedient
to
take
the
ground
that
slavery
is
not
sin
it
probably
has
not
occurred
to
you
how
fairly
and
fully
you
might
have
been
stopped
upon
the
very
threshold
of
your
defence
of
slavery
the
only
witness
you
have
called
to
the
stand
to
sustain
your
sinking
cause
is
the
bible
but
this
is
a
witness
which
slavery
has
itself
impeached
and
of
which
therefore
it
is
not
entitled
to
avail
itself
it
is
a
good
rule
in
our
civil
courts
that
a
party
is
not
permitted
to
impeach
his
own
witness
and
it
is
but
an
inconsiderable
variation
of
the
letter
of
this
rule
and
obviously
no
violation
of
its
spirit
and
policy
to
say
that
no
party
is
permitted
to
attempt
to
benefit
his
cause
by
a
witness
whom
he
has
himself
impeached
now
the
slaveholder
palpably
violates
this
rule
when
he
presumes
to
offer
the
bible
as
a
witness
for
his
cause
for
he
has
previously
impeached
it
by
declaring
in
his
slave
system
that
it
is
not
to
be
believed
that
its
requirements
are
not
to
be
obeyed
that
they
are
not
even
to
be
read
though
the
bible
expressly
directs
that
they
shall
be
that
concubinage
shall
be
substituted
for
the
marriage
it
enjoins
and
that
its
other
provisions
for
the
happiness
and
even
the
existence
of
the
social
relations
shall
be
trampled
under
foot
the
scene
in
which
a
lawyer
should
ask
the
jury
to
believe
what
his
witness
is
saying
at
one
moment
and
to
reject
what
he
is
saying
at
another
would
be
ludicrous
enough
but
what
more
absurdity
is
there
in
it
than
that
which
the
party
are
guilty
of
when
they
would
have
us
deaf
whilst
their
witness
is
testifying
in
favor
of
marriage
and
searching
the
scriptures
and
all
ears
whilst
that
same
witness
is
testifying
as
they
construe
it
in
favor
of
slavery
no
before
it
will
be
competent
for
the
american
slaveholder
to
appeal
to
the
bible
for
justification
of
his
system
that
system
must
be
so
modified
as
no
longer
to
make
open
shameless
war
upon
the
bible
i
would
recommend
to
slaveholders
that
rather
than
make
so
unhallowed
a
use
of
the
bible
as
to
attempt
to
bolster
up
their
hard
beset
cause
with
it
they
should
take
the
ground
which
a
very
distinguished
slaveholding
gentleman
of
the
city
of
washington
took
in
a
conversation
with
myself
on
the
subject
of
slavery
feeling
himself
uncomfortably
plied
by
quotations
from
the
word
of
god
he
said
with
much
emphasis
stop
sir
with
that
if
you
please
slavery
is
a
subject
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
bible
this
practice
of
attempting
to
put
the
boldest
and
most
flagrant
sins
under
the
wing
and
sanction
of
the
bible
is
chargeable
on
others
as
well
as
on
the
advocates
of
slavery
not
to
speak
of
other
instances
of
it
it
is
sought
to
justify
by
this
blessed
book
the
most
despotic
forms
of
civil
government
and
the
drinking
of
intoxicating
liquors
there
are
two
evils
so
great
which
arise
from
this
perversion
of
the
word
of
god
that
i
can
not
forbear
to
notice
them
one
is
that
the
consciences
of
men
are
quieted
when
they
imagine
that
they
have
found
a
justification
in
the
bible
for
the
sins
of
which
they
are
guilty
the
other
is
that
infidels
are
multiplied
by
this
perversion
a
respectable
gentleman
who
edits
a
newspaper
in
this
neighborhood
and
who
unhappily
is
not
established
in
the
christian
faith
was
asked
a
few
months
since
to
attend
a
meeting
of
a
bible
society
i
am
not
willing
said
he
in
reply
to
favor
the
circulation
of
a
volume
which
many
of
its
friends
claim
to
be
on
the
side
of
slavery
rely
on
it
sir
that
wherever
your
book
produces
the
conviction
that
the
bible
justifies
slavery
it
there
weakens
whatever
of
respect
for
that
blessed
volume
previously
existed
whoever
is
brought
to
associate
slavery
with
the
bible
may
it
is
true
think
better
of
slavery
but
he
will
surely
think
worse
of
the
bible
i
hope
therefore
in
mercy
to
yourself
and
the
world
that
the
success
of
your
undertaking
will
be
small
but
oftentimes
the
same
providence
has
a
bright
as
well
as
a
gloomy
aspect
it
is
so
in
the
case
before
us
the
common
attempt
in
our
day
to
intrench
great
sins
in
the
authority
of
the
bible
is
a
consoling
and
cheering
evidence
that
this
volume
is
recognised
as
the
public
standard
of
right
and
wrong
and
that
whatever
may
be
their
private
opinions
of
it
who
are
guilty
of
these
sins
they
can
not
hope
to
justify
themselves
before
the
world
unless
their
lives
are
apparently
at
least
conformed
in
some
good
degree
to
this
standard
we
may
add
too
that
as
surely
as
the
bible
is
against
slavery
every
writer
who
like
yourself
appeals
to
it
as
the
infallible
and
only
admissible
standard
of
right
and
wrong
will
contribute
to
the
overthrow
of
the
iniquitous
system
his
writings
may
not
uniformly
tend
to
this
happy
result
in
some
instances
he
may
strengthen
confidence
in
the
system
of
slavery
by
producing
conviction
that
the
bible
sanctions
it
and
then
his
success
will
be
as
before
remarked
at
the
expense
of
the
claims
and
authority
of
the
bible
but
these
instances
of
the
pernicious
effects
of
his
writings
will
be
very
rare
quite
too
rare
we
may
hope
to
counterbalance
the
more
generally
useful
tendency
of
writings
on
the
subject
of
slavery
which
recognise
the
paramount
authority
of
law
having
completed
the
examination
of
your
book
i
wish
to
hold
up
to
you
in
a
single
view
the
substance
of
what
you
have
done
you
have
come
forth
the
unblushing
advocate
of
american
slavery
a
system
which
whether
we
study
its
nature
in
the
deliberate
and
horrid
enactments
of
its
code
or
in
the
heathenism
and
pollution
and
sweat
and
tears
and
blood
which
prove
but
too
well
the
agreement
of
its
practical
character
with
its
theory
is
beyond
all
doubt
more
oppressive
and
wicked
than
any
other
which
the
avaricious
sensual
cruel
heart
of
man
ever
devised
you
have
come
forth
the
unblushing
advocate
of
a
system
under
which
parents
are
daily
selling
their
children
brothers
and
sisters
their
brothers
and
sisters
members
of
the
church
of
christ
their
under
which
in
a
word
immortal
man
made
in
the
image
of
god
is
more
unfeelingly
and
cruelly
dealt
with
than
the
brute
i
know
that
you
intimate
that
this
system
would
work
well
were
it
in
the
hands
of
none
but
good
men
but
with
equal
propriety
might
you
say
that
the
or
the
brothel
would
work
well
in
such
hands
you
have
attempted
to
sustain
this
system
by
the
testimony
of
the
bible
the
system
a
part
only
of
the
crimes
of
which
most
of
the
nations

against
which
the
common

are
arrayed
this
system
so
execrable

infamous
you
have
had
the
presumption
to
attempt
to
vindicate
by
that
blessed
book
whose

is

purer

evil

who

now
sir
let
me
solemnly
inquire
of
you
whether
it
is
right
to
do
what
you
have
done
whether
it
is
befitting
a

a

and

let
me
further
ask
you
whether
you

any
cheering
testimony

that
it

you
have

definition
of
slavery
if
we
would
know
whether
the
bible
is
the
charter
of
slavery
we
must
first
determine
what
slavery
the
thing
itself
must
be
separated
from
its
appendages
a
constituent
element
is
one
thing
a
relation
another
an
appendage
another
relations
and
appendages
presuppose
things
of
which
there
are
relations
and
appendages
to
regard
them
as
to
which
they
pertain
or
as
constituent
parts
of
them
leads
to
endless
fallacies
a
great
variety
of
conditions
relations
and
tenures
indispensable
to
the
social
state
are
confounded
with
slavery
and
thus
slaveholding
is
deemed
quite
harmless
if
not
virtuous
we
will
specify
some
of
the
things
which
are
often
confounded
with
slavery
of
the
right
of
then
are
slaves
to
then
are
slaves
without
then
of
the
people
of
rhode
island
are
slaves
and
in
the
district
of
columbia
of
one
oath
in
then
the
colored
people
of
ohio
are
slaves
so
are
disbelievers
in
a
future
retribution
generally
of
trial
by
then
all
in
france
and
germany
are
slaves
required
to
support
a
particular
then
the
people
of
england
are
slaves
to
the
preceding
may
be
added
all
other
disabilities
merely
political
and
wives
are
often
cruelly
treated
hired
domestics
are
often
oppressed
but
these
forms
of
oppression
are
not
slavery
the
rights
and
duties
of
master
and
apprentice
are
correlative
and
reciprocal
the
of
each
upon
the
other
results
from
the
of
each
to
the
other
apprenticeship
is
based
on
the
principle
of
equivalent
for
value
received
the
rights
of
the
apprentice
are
secured
and
his
interests
are
promoted
equally
with
those
of
the
master
indeed
while
the
law
of
apprenticeship
is
to
the
master
it
is
to
the
apprentice
its
main
design
is
rather
to
benefit
the
apprentice
than
the
master
it
the
interests
of
the
former
while
it
guards
from
injury
those
of
the
latter
in
doing
it
it
secures
to
the
master
a
mere
legal
compensation
while
it
secures
to
the
apprentice
both
a
legal
compensation
and
a
virtual
gratuity
in
addition
the
apprentice
being
of
the
two
decidedly
the
greatest
gainer
the
law
not
only
recognizes
the
of
the
apprentice
to
a
reward
for
his
labor
but
appoints
the
wages
and
enforces
the
payment
the
master
claim
covers
only
the
of
the
apprentice
the
apprentice
claim
covers
the
services
of
the
master
the
master
can
not
hold
the
apprentice
as
property
nor
the
apprentice
the
master
but
each
holds
property
in
the
services
of
the
other
and
both
equally
is
this
slavery
subordination
and
parental
both
are
dictates
and
indispensable
to
the
existence
of
the
social
state
their
the
promotion
of
mutual
welfare
and
the
those
natural
affections
created
by
the
relation
of
parent
and
child
and
blending
them
in
one
by
irrepressible
affinities
and
thus
while
exciting
each
to
discharge
those
offices
incidental
to
the
relation
they
constitute
a
shield
for
mutual
protection
the
parent
legal
claim
to
the
services
of
his
children
while
minors
is
a
slight
boon
for
the
care
and
toil
of
their
rearing
to
say
nothing
of
outlays
for
support
and
education
this
provision
for
the
good
of
the

with
the
greater
part
of
mankind
indispensable
to
the
preservation
of
the
family
state
the
child
in
helping
his
parents
helps
himself
increases
a
common
stock
in
which
he
has
a
share
while
his
most
faithful
services
do
but
acknowledge
a
debt
that
money
can
not
cancel
for

or
governmental

innocence
be
punished

guilt

true
the
criminal
works

without

well

may
he

the
government
a

not

he
is
a

so
because

nothing
besides

it

but
it

not

the

thus
break

many
of

no

proceed
to

a

the
most
eminent
of
the
jewish
writers
if
we
except
perhaps
the
egyptian
maimonides
who
wrote
seven
hundred
years
ago
in
his
comment
on
this
stealing
and
making
merchandize
of
men
gives
the
meaning
thus
using
a
man
against
his
will
as
a
servant
lawfully
purchased
yea
though
he
should
use
his
services
ever
so
little
only
to
the
value
of
a
farthing
or
use
but
his
arm
to
lean
on
to
support
him
he
be
forced
so
to
act
as
a
the
person
compelling
him
but
once
to
do
so
shall
die
as
a
thief
whether
he
has
sold
him
or
not
the
hebrew
word
here
rendered
means
the
taking
from
another
what
to
him
whether
it
be
by
violence
or
fraud
the
same
word
is
used
in
the
eighth
commandment
and
prohibits
both
and
theft
the
crime
specified
is
that
of
somebody
the
ownership
of
a
is
this
somebody
a
master
and
is
the
crime
that
of
depriving
a
of
his
then
it
would
have
been
he
that
stealeth
a

that
stealeth

if
the
crime
had
been
the
taking
of
an
individual
from
then
the
used
would
have
been
of
that
and
if
it
was
the
relation
of
property
and
the
crime
as
stated
in
the
passage
is
man
and
all
are
put
on
a
level

death
this

joseph
said
to
the
servants
of
pharoah
indeed
i
was
away
out
of
the
land
of
the
hebrews
xl
how
his
brethren
took
him
and
sold
him
as
an
of
contrast
this
penalty
for
with
that
for
exod
xxii
if
a
man
stole
an
and
killed
or
sold
it
he
was
to
restore
five
oxen
if
he
had
neither
sold
nor
killed
it
the
penalty
was
two
oxen
the
selling
or
the
killing
being
virtually
a
deliberate
repetition
of
the
crime
the
penalty
was
more
than
doubled
but
in
the
case
of
stealing
a
the
first
act
drew
down
the
utmost
power
of
punishment
however
often
repeated
or
however
aggravated
the
crime
human
penalty
could
do
no
more
the
fact
that
the
penalty
for
was
death
and
the
penalty
for
the
mere
of
shows
that
the
two
cases
were
adjudicated
on
totally
different
principles
the
man
stolen
might
be
past
labor
and
his
support
a
yet
death
was
the
penalty
though
not
a
worth
of
was
taken
the
penalty
for
stealing
was
a
mere
however
large
the
amount
stolen
the
payment
of
wiped
out
the
score
it
might
have
a
greater
value
than
a
men
yet
was
never
the
penalty
nor
maiming
nor
branding
nor
even
whatever
the
kind
or
the
amount
stolen
the
unvarying
penalty
was
double
of
same
why
was
not
the
rule
uniform
when
a
was
stolen
why
not
require
the
thief
to
restore
of
the
same
kind
two
or
if
he
had
sold
him
men
do
you
say
that
the
might
not
them
so
the
might
not
have
two
or
if
he
had
killed
it
but
if
god
permitted
men
to
hold
as
property
equally
with
the
could
get
with
whom
to
pay
the
penalty
as
well
as
the
further
when
was
stolen
the
whole
of
the
legal
penalty
was
a
compensation
to
the
person
injured
but
when
a
was
stolen
no
property
compensation
was
offered
to
tender
as
an
equivalent
would
have
been
to
repeat
the
outrage
with
the
intolerable
aggravations
of
supreme
insult
and
impiety
compute
the
value
of
a
man
in
throw
dust
into
the
scale
against
immortality
the
law
recoiled
from
such
outrage
and
blasphemy
to
have
permitted
the
to
expiate
his
crime
by
restoring
double
would
have
been
making
the
repetition
of
crime
its
atonement
but
the
infliction
of
death
for
exacted
from
the
guilty
wretch
the
utmost
possibility
of
reparation
it
wrung
from
him
as
he
gave
up
the
ghost
a
testimony
in
blood
and
death
groans
to
the
infinite
dignity
and
worth
of
man
a
proclamation
to
the
universe
voiced
in
mortal
agony
that
man
is
inviolable
a
confession
shrieked
in
phrenzy
at
the
grave
mouth
i
die
accursed
and
god
is
just
if
god
permitted
man
to
hold
as
property
why
did
he
punish
for
stealing
kind
of
property
infinitely
more
than
for
stealing
any
kind
of
property
why
did
he
punish
with
for
stealing
a
very
little
perhaps
not
a
sixpence
worth
of
sort
of
property
and
make
a
mere
the
penalty
for
stealing
a
thousand
times
as
much
of
any
other
sort
of
property
especially
if
god
did
by
his
own
act
annihilate
the
difference
between
man
and
by
putting
him
a
level
with
the
atrociousness
of
a
crime
depends
greatly
upon
the
nature
character
and
condition
of
the
victim
to
steal
is
a
crime
whoever
the
thief
or
whatever
the
plunder
to
steal
bread
from
a
man
is
theft
to
steal
it
from
a
man
is
both
theft
and
murder
if
i
steal
my
neighbor
the
crime
consists
not
in
the
of
the
article
but
in
its
external
from
to
but
when
i
take
my
neighbor
and
first
make
him
and
then
property
the
latter
act
which
was
the
sole
crime
in
the
former
case
dwindles
to
a
mere
appendage
the
sin
in
stealing
a
man
does
not
consist
in
transferring
from
its
owner
to
another
that
which
is
but
in
turning
into
true
the
of
man
still
remain
but
the
rights
and
immunities
which
grow
out
of
them
are
it
is
the
first
law
of
reason
and
revelation
to
regard
things
and
beings
as
they
are
and
the
sum
of
religion
to
feel
and
act
toward
them
according
to
their
nature
and
value
knowingly
to
treat
them
otherwise
is
and
the
degree
of
violence
done
to
their
nature
relations
and
value
measures
its
guilt
when
things
are
sundered
which
god
has
indissolubly
joined
or
confounded
in
one
which
he
has
separated
by
infinite
extremes
when
sacred
and
eternal
distinctions
which
he
has
garnished
with
glory
are
derided
and
set
at
nought
then
if
ever
reddens
in
its
scarlet
dye
the
sin
specified
in
the
passage
is
that
of
doing
violence
to
the
of
a
his
and
relations
as
a
rational
being
and
blotting
out
the
exalted
distinction
stamped
upon
him
by
his
maker
in
the
verse
preceding
and
in
that
which
follows
the
same
principle
is
laid
down
verse
then
smiteth
his
father
or
his
mother
shall
surely
be
put
to
verse
that
curseth
his
father
or
his
mother
shall
surely
be
put
to
if
a
jew
smote
his
neighbor
the
law
merely
smote
him
in
return
but
if
that
same
blow
were
given
to
a
the
law
struck
the
smiter
why
this
difference
in
the
punishment
of
the
same
act
inflicted
on
different
persons
answer
god
guards
the
parental
relation
with
peculiar
care
it
is
the
of
human
relations
to
violate
that
is
to
violate
whoever
trampled
on
showed
that
no
relation
had
any
sacredness
in
his
eyes
that
he
was
unfit
to
move
among
human
relations
who
had
violated
one
so
sacred
and
therefore
the
mosaic
law
uplifted
his
bleeding
corpse
and
brandished
the
ghastly
terror
around
the
parental
relation
to
guard
it
from
impious
inroads
but
why
the
difference
in
the
penalty
since
the
was
the
same
the
sin
had
divers
aggravations
the
relation
violated
was
obvious
the
distinction
between
parents
and
others
manifest
dictated
by
natural
affection
a
law
of
the
constitution
the
act
was
violence
to
nature
a
suicide
on
constitutional
susceptibilities
the
parental
relation
then
as
now
was
the
centre
of
the
social
system
and
required
powerful
thy
father
and
thy
stands
at
the
head
of
those
commands
which
prescribe
the
duties
of
man
to
man
and
throughout
the
bible
the
parental
relation
is
god
favorite
illustration
of
his
own
relations
to
the
whole
family
of
man
in
this
case
death
is
inflicted
not
at
all
for
the
act
of
nor
for
smiting
a
but
a
for
violating
a
vital
and
sacred
relation
a
cherished
by
god
and
around
which
both
in
the
moral
and
ceremonial
law
he
threw
up
a
bulwark
of
defence
in
the
next
verse
he
that
stealeth
a
man
the
same
principle
is
wrought
out
in
still
stronger
relief
the
crime
here
punished
with
death
is
not
the
mere
act
of
taking
property
from
its
owner
but
the
disregarding
of
doing
violence
to
an
making
war
on
a
of
priceless
worth
that
distinction
which
is
cast
headlong
by
the
principle
of
american
slavery
which
makes
men
the
incessant
throughout
the
old
testament
in
the
separation
of
human
beings
from
brutes
and
things
shows
god
regard
for
the
sacredness
of
his
own
distinction
in
the
beginning
the
lord
uttered
it
in
heaven
and
proclaimed
it
to
the
universe
as
it
rose
into
being
he
arrayed
creation
at
the
instant
of
its
birth
to
do
it
reverent
homage
it
paused
in
adoration
while
he
ushered
forth
its
crowning
work
why
that
dread
pause
and
that
creating
arm
held
back
in
mid
career
and
that
high
conference
in
the
godhead
us
make
man
our
image
our
likeness
and
let
him
have
dominion
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
over
the
fowl
of
the
air
and
over
the
cattle
and
over
all
the
earth
and
over
every
living
thing
that
moveth
upon
the
while
every
living
thing
with
land
and
sea
and
firmament
and
marshalled
worlds
waited
to
catch
and
swell
the
shout
of
morning

then
god
created

in
his
own
image
in
the
image

him
this
solves
the
problem
in
the

all
together

madest
him

put

o

our
lord
how
excellent
is
thy
name
in
all
the
psalms
viii
the
frequent
and
solemn
repetition
of
this
distinction
by
god
proclaims
his
infinite
regard
the
and
verses
of
the
chapter
of
genesis
are
little
else
than
the
repetition
of
it
in
various
forms
in
the
chapter
verse
we
find
it
again
in
the
day
that
god
created
man
in
the
likeness
of
god
made

man
in
the
chapter
verse
we
find
it
again
after
giving
license
to
shed
the
blood
of
every
moving
thing
that
liveth
it
is
added
sheddeth
man
blood
by
man
shall
his
blood
be
shed
in
the
image
of

as
though
he
had
said
all
these

your
use
they

would
fail
us
to
detail
the
instances
in
which
this
distinction
is
most
impressively
marked
in
the
bible
in
further
prosecuting
this
inquiry
the
patriarchal
and
mosaic
systems
will
be
considered
together
as
each
reflects
light
upon
the
other
and
as
many
regulations
of
the
latter
are
mere
forms
of
divine
institutions
previously
existing
as
a
however
the
latter
alone
is
of
divine
authority
whatever
were
the
usages
of
the
god
has
not
made
them
our
examplars
a
footnote
a
those
who
insist
that
the
patriarchs
held
slaves
and
sit
with
such
delight
under
their
shadow
hymning
the
praises
of
those
good
old
patriarchs
and
slaveholders
might
at
small
cost
greatly
augment
their
numbers
a
single
stanza
celebrating
patriarchal
winding
off
with
a
chorus
in
honor
of
patriarchal
would
be
a
trumpet
call
summoning
from
bush
and
brake
highway
and
hedge
and
sheltering
fence
a
brotherhood
of
kindred
affinities
each
claiming
abraham
or
noah
as
his
patron
saint
and
shouting
my
name
is
legion
what
a
myriad
choir
and
thunderous
song
before
entering
upon
an
analysis
of
the
condition
of
servants
under
these
two
states
of
society
let
us
settle
the
import
of
certain
terms
which
describe
the
mode
of
procuring
them
import
of
the
word
buy
and
the
phrase
bought
with
money
from
the
direction
to
the
israelites
to
buy
their
servants
and
from
the
phrase
bought
with
money
applied
to
abraham
servants
it
is
argued
that
they
were
articles
of
the
sole
ground
for
this
belief
is
the
buy
and
bought
with
money
and
such
an
import
to
these
terms
when
applied
to
servants
is
assumed
not
only
in
the
absence
of
all
proof
but
in
the
face
of
evidence
to
the
contrary
how
much
might
be
saved
if
in
discussion
the
thing
to
be
proved
was
always
to
the
question
in
debate
what
economy
of
midnight
oil
what
a
forestaller
of
premature
wrinkles
and
grey
hairs
instead
of
protracted
investigation
into
scripture
usage
and
painful
collating
of
passages
and
cautiously
tracing
minute
relations
to
find
the
meaning
of
scripture
terms
let
every
man
boldly
resolve
to
interpret
the
language
of
the
oldest
book
in
the
world
by
the
usages
of
his
own
time
and
place
and
the
work
is
done
and
then
what
a
march
of
mind
instead
of
revelation
they
might
be
multiplied
as
the
drops
of
the
morning
every
man
might
take
orders
as
an
inspired
interpreter
with
an
infallible
clue
to
the
mind
of
the
spirit
if
he
only
understood
the
dialect
of
his
own
neighborhood
we
repeat
it
the
only
ground
of
proof
that
these
terms
are
to
be
interpreted
to
mean
when
applied
to
servants
in
the
bible
the
same
that
they
mean
when
applied
to
our
is
the
terms
what
a
it
would
make
of
the
bible
to
take
it
for
granted
that
the
sense
in
which
words
are
used
is
the
sense
david
says
i
prevented
the
dawning
of
the
morning
and
cried
what
a
to
stop
the
earth
in
its
revolution
rather
too
fast
two
hundred
years
ago
was
used
in
the
strict
latin
sense
to
or
it
is
always
used
in
this
sense
in
the
old
and
new
testaments
david
expression
in
the
english
of
the
nineteenth
century
is
before
the
dawning
of
the
morning
i
cried
or
i
began
to
cry
before
so
my
prayer
shall
thee
let
us
his
face
with
thanksgiving
mine
eyes
the
night
watches
we
shall
not
them
that
are
asleep
in
almost
every
chapter
of
the
bible
words
are
used
in
a
sense
now
nearly
or
quite
obsolete
and
sometimes
in
a
sense
totally
to
their
present
meaning
a
few
examples
follow
oftentimes
i
purposed
to
come
to
you
but
was
hindered
hitherto
and
the
four
living
ones

down
and

shall
cause
to
sin
one
of
these
little
ones
go
out
into
the
high
ways
and
urge
them
to
come
in
only
let
your
habitual
conduct
or
course
of
life
be
as
becometh
the
gospel
they
that
seek
me
earnestly
shall
find
me
give
me
and
now
in
a
charger
the
head
of
john
the
baptist
so
when
tribulation
or
persecution
ariseth
immediately
they
are
offended
nothing
is
more
mutable
than
language
words
like
bodies
are
continually
throwing
off
particles
and
absorbing
others
so
long
as
they
are
mere
elected
by
the
whims
of
universal
suffrage
their
meaning
will
be
a
perfect
volatile
and
to
cork
it
up
for
the
next
century
is
an
employment
sufficiently
silly
to
speak
within
bounds
for
a
modern
bible
dictionary
maker
there
never
was
a
shallower
conceit
than
that
of
establishing
the
sense
attached
to
a
word
centuries
ago
by
showing
what
it
means
pity
that
mantuamakers
and
milliners
were
not
a
little
quicker
at
taking
hints
from
some
of
our
doctors
of
divinity
how
easily
they
could
save
their
pious
customers
all
qualms
of
conscience
about
the
weekly
shiftings
of
fashion
by
demonstrating
that
the
last
importation
of
parisian
indecency
just
now
flaunting
here
on
promenade
was
the
identical
style
of
dress
in
which
the
pious
sarah
kneaded
cakes
for
the
angels
the
modest
rebecca
drew
water
for
the
camels
of
abraham
servants
since
such
fashions
are
rife
in
and
broadway
they
have
been
in
canaan
and
pandanaram
four
thousand
years
ago
ii
the
inference
that
the
word
buy
used
to
describe
the
procuring
of
servants
means
procuring
them
as
seems
based
upon
the
fallacy
that
whatever
money
money
that
whatever
or
whoever
you
pay
money
is
an
article
of
property
and
the
fact
of
your
paying
for
it
that
it
is
property

that

in

if

the
words
in
the
original
used
to
describe
the
one
describe
the
other
why
not
contend
that
the
wives
of
the
ancient
fathers
of
the
faithful
were
their
chattels
and
used
as
ready
change
at
a
pinch
and
thence
deduce
the
rights
of
modern
husbands
how
far
gone
is
the
church
from
primitive
purity
how
slow
to
emulate
illustrious
examples
alas
patriarchs
and
prophets
are
followed
afar
off
when
will
pious
husbands
live
up
to
their
bible
privileges
and
become
partakers
with
old
testament
worthies
in
the
blessedness
of
a
husband
rightful
immunities
surely
professors
of
religion
now
are
to
buy
and
hold
their
wives
as
property
refusing
so
to
do
is
to
question
the
morality
of
those
good
old
patriarchs
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
with
the
prophets
and
a
host
of
whom
the
world
was
not
worthy
the
use
of
the
word
buy
to
describe
the
procuring
of
wives
is
not
peculiar
to
the
hebrew
in
the
syriac
language
the
common
expression
for
the
married
or
the
espoused
is
the
bought
even
so
late
as
the
century
the
common
record
of
in
the
old
german
chronicles
was
a
bought
b
the
hebrew
word
translated
is
like
other
words
modified
by
the
nature
of
the
subject
to
which
it
is

a

of

at

day
the

used
to
describe
the
procuring
of
servants
where
slavery
is
abolished
in
the
british
west
indies
where
slaves
became
apprentices
in
they
are
still

this
is

a
few
years

as
really
as

the
different
senses

which
the

word
is
used
in
the
two
states
puts
no
man
in
a
quandary
whose
common
sense
amounts
to
a
modicum
so
under
the
system
of
legal
in
illinois
servants
now
are
a
a
short
time
since
hundreds
of
foreigners
who
came

country
were
bought
annually
by
voluntary
contract

engaged

alas
for

and
taken
the
transaction
between
joseph
and
the
egyptians
gives
a
clue
to
the
meaning
attached
to
buy
and
bought
with
money
see
xlvii
the
egyptians
proposed
to
joseph
to
become
servants
and
that
he
should
them
when
the
bargain
was
closed
joseph
said
behold
i
have
this
day
and
yet
it
is
plain
that
neither
of
the
parties
dreamed
that
the
persons
were
in
any
sense
articles
of
property
but
merely
that
they
became
thereby
obligated
to
labor
for
the
government
on
certain
conditions
as
a
for
the
entire
support
of
themselves
and
families
during
the
famine
and
that
the
idea
attached
to
buy
us
and
behold
i
have
bought
you
was
merely
the
procuring
of
services
voluntarily
offered
and
secured
by
contract
as
a
return
for
and
not
at
all
that
the
egyptians
were
bereft
of
their
personal
ownership
and
made
articles
of
property
and
this
buying
of
they
were
to
give
part
of
their
crops
to
pharaoh
is
called
in
scripture
usage
the
this
case
deserves
special
notice
as
it
is
the
only
one
where
the
whole
transaction
of
buying
servants
is
detailed
the
preliminaries
the
process
the
mutual
acquiescence
and
the
permanent
relation
resulting
therefrom
in
all
other
instances
the
is
stated
without
entering
into
particulars
in
this
case
the
whole
process
is
laid
open
the
persons
bought
and
of
their
own
accord
obtaining
permanently
the
of
persons
or
even
a
portion
of
them
is
called
buying
those
persons
the
objector
at
the
outset
assumes
that
servants
were
bought
of
persons
and
thence
infers
that
they
were
articles
of
property
this
is
sheer
not
a
single
instance
is
recorded
of
a
servant
being
sold
by
any
one
but
himself
not
a
case
either
under
the
patriarchal
or
the
mosaic
systems
in
which
a
sold
his
that
the
servants
who
were
bought
is
a
fair
inference
from
various
passages
of
scripture
in
leviticus
xxv
the
case
of
the
israelite
who
became
the
servant
of
the
stranger
the
words
are
if
he
sell
himself
unto
the
stranger
the
and
the
same
of
the
word
which
in
the
verse
is
rendered
is
in
the
verse
of
the
same
chapter
rendered

the

renunciation

to

they
abhorred
the

despised
its

spurned
the

instead
of
rejoicing
in
the
deliverance
which
it
commemmorated
bewailed
it

cursed

its
consummation

times

his

oppressive
acts
and
his

claim
to

protection
you
shall
not
force
him
back
and
thus
recognize
the
of
the
master
to
hold
him
in
such
a
condition
as
induces
him
to
flee
to
others
for
protection
it
may
be
objected
that
this
command
had
no
reference
to
servants
among
the

only
to
those
of
masters
in
the
surrounding
nations
we
answer
the
regulation
has
no
restriction
its
terms
are
unlimited
but
the
objection
even
if
valid
merely
shifts
the
pressure
of
the
difficulty
to
another
point
does
god
array
his
infinite
authority
to
protect
the
of
a
servant
from
the
heathen
and
yet
the
same
persons
to
crush
the
free
choice
of
of
servants
from
the
heathen
suppose
a
case
a
servant
flees
from
his
master
to
the
israelites
god
speaks

shall
dwell
with

in
that
place
which

where
it

they
were
strictly
charged
not
to
put
him
in
a
condition
which
he
did
not
now
suppose
this
same
servant
instead
of
coming
into
israel
of
his
own
accord
had
been
in
by
some
kidnapper
who
him
of
his
master
and
him
into
a
condition
against
his
will
would
he
who
forbade
such
treatment
of
the
stranger
who
came
into
the
land
sanction
the
treatment
of
the
provided
in
to
this
last
outrage
the
one
had
been
committed
of
him
into
the
nation
against
his
to
commit
violence
on
the
free
choice
of
a
servant
is
a
horrible
enormity
forsooth
provided
you
the
violence
he
has
come
among
you
but
if
you
commit

on
the
side
of

if
you
the
outrage
by
buying
him
from
a
third
person

and
then
tear
him
from
home
and
drag
him
across
the
line
into
the
land
of
israel
and
hold
him
as
a
slave
ah
that
alters
the
case
and
you
may
perpetrate
the
violence
now
with
impunity
would
favor
have
been
shown
to
this
new
comer
from
the
heathen
than
to
the
old
residents
those
who
had
been
servants
in
jewish
families
perhaps
for
a
generation
were
the
israelites
commanded
to
exercise
toward
uncircumcised
and
of
the
covenant
a
justice
and
kindness
denied
to
the
multitude
who
circumcised
and
the
covenant
again
the
objector
finds
small
gain
to
his
argument
on
the
supposition
that
the
covenant
respected
merely
the
fugitives
from
the
surrounding
nations
while
it
left
the
servants
of
the
israelites
in
a
condition
against
their
wills
the
objector
finds
small
gain
to
his
argument
in
that
case
the
surrounding
nations
would
of
course
adopt
retaliatory
measures
and
resolve
themselves
into
so
many
asylums
for
fugitive
israelitish
servants
as
these
nations
were
on
every
side
of
them
such
a
proclamation
would
have
been
an
effectual
lure
to
men
held
in
a
condition
which
was
a
constant
of
further
the
objector

itself
for

a

at
such
a
rate
to
such
persons
and
in
such
places
as
they
pleased
besides
grant
that
this

prohibited
the
sending

any

are
an
illustration
at
one
time
he
had
three
hundred

probably
many
more

housekeeper

it
is
not

to
conceive
how
they
contrived

so

the
patriarch
and
his

the

exploit
of
surrounding

neither

also
to
have
been
sadly
deficient
in

the
auxiliaries
of

such
as
stocks

his
destitution

could
own
nothing

would
have
been
consummate
stupidity

itself
convict
him
of

since
the
possession

use
of

was
common
under

he
might
have
it

invest

use

attracting

attention

that
consideration

condition
of
servants
in
their
masters
families
the
privileges
which
they
shared
in
common
with
the
children
and
their
recognition
as
equals
by
the
highest
officers
of
the
government
make
the
doctrine
that
they
were
commodities
the
testimony
of
paul
in
gal

gives
an
insight
into
the
condition
of
servants
now
i
say
unto
you
that
the
heir
so
long
as
he
is
a
child
differeth
nothing
from
a
servant
he
be
lord
of
all
that
abraham
servants
were
voluntary
that
their
interests
were
identified
with
those
of
their
master
family
that
they
were
regarded
with
great
affection
by
the
household
and
that
the
utmost
confidence
was
reposed
in
them
is
shown
in
the
arming
of
of
them
for
the
recovery
of
lot
and
his
family
from
captivity
see
xiv
when
abraham
servant
went
to
padanaram
the
young
princess
rebekah

not
disdain
to
say

my
lord
as
she
hasted
and
let
down
her
pitcher
upon
her
hand
and
gave
him
drink
and
she
hasted
and
emptied
her
pitcher
and
ran
again
unto
the
well
and
drew
for
all
his
camels
laban
the
brother
of
rebekah
prepared
the

for

brought
him

to

the

that
were
with
him
in
the
chapter
of
samuel
we
have
an
account
of
a
high
festival
in
the
city
of
zuph
at
which
samuel
the
chief
judge
and
ruler
in
israel
presided
none
sat
down
at
the
feast
but
those
that
were
bidden
and
only
about
persons
were
invited
quite
a
select
party
the
elite
of
the
city
of
zuph
saul
and
his
servant
arrived
at
zuph
just
as
the
party
was
assembling
and
of
them
at
samuel
solicitation
accompany
him
as
invited
guests
and
samuel
took
saul

in
chiefest
seats
those
that
were
bidden
a
invited
by
the
chief
judge
ruler
and
prophet
in
israel
to
dine
publicly
with
a
select
party
in
company
with
his
master
who
was
the
same
time
anointed
king
of
and
this
servant
introduced
by
samuel
into
the
parlor
and
assigned
with
his
master

of

easily
spared

no

rare
would
be
likely
to
find
scope
in
looking
after

we
learn
from
kings

that
elah
the
king
of
israel
was
slain
by
zimri
one
of
his
chief
officers
at
a
festive
entertainment
in
the
house
of
arza
his
steward
or
head
servant
with
whom
he
seems
to
have
been
on
terms
of
familiarity

the
intercourse
between
gideon
and

condition
of
the
gibeonites
as
subjects
of
the
hebrew
commonwealth
shows
that
they
were
neither
articles
of
property
nor
involuntary
the
condition
of
the
inhabitants
of
gibeon
chephirah
beeroth
and
kirjathjearim
under
the
israelites
is
quoted
in
triumph
by
the
advocates
of
slavery
and
truly
they
are
right
welcome
to
all
the
crumbs
that
can
be
gleaned
from
it
milton
devils
made
desperate
snatches
at
fruit
that
turned
to
ashes
on
their
lips
the
spirit
of
slavery
raves
under
tormenting
gnawings
and
casts
about
in
blind
phrenzy
for
something
to
ease
or
even
to
them
but
for
this
it
would
never
have
clutched
at
the
gibeonites
for
even
the
incantations
of
the
demon
cauldron
could
not
extract
from
their
case
enough
to
tantalize
starvation
self
but
to
the
question
what
was
the
condition
of
the
gibeonites
under
the
israelites
was
it
was
their
own
proposition
to
joshua
to
become
servants
joshua
ix
their
proposition
was
accepted
but
the
kind
of
service
which
they
should
perform
was
not
specified
until
their
gross
imposition
came
to
light
they
were
then
assigned
to
menial
offices
in
the
tabernacle
were
not
domestic
servants
in
the
families
of
the
they
still
continued
to
reside
in
their
own
cities
cultivating
their
own
fields
tending
their
flocks
and
herds
and
exercising
the
functions
of
a
though
not
independent
community
they
were
to
the
jewish
nation
as
so
far
from
being
distributed
among
the
israelites
their
family
relations
broken
up
and
their
internal
organization
as
a
distinct
people
abolished
they
seem
to
have
remained
a
separate
and
in
some
respects
an
independent
community
for
many
centuries
when
they
were
attacked
by
the
amorites
they
applied
to
the
israelites
as
confederates
for
aid
it
was
promptly
rendered
their
enemies
routed
and
themselves
left
unmolested
in
the
occupation
of
their
cities
while
all
israel
returned
to
gilgal
joshua
x
long
afterwards
saul
slew
some
of
them
and
god
sent
upon
israel
a
three
years
famine
for
it
david
said
to
the
gibeonites
what
shall
i
do
for
you
and
wherewith
shall
i
make
the
atonement
that
ye
may
bless
the
inheritance
of
the
lord
at
their
demand
he
delivered
up
to
them
seven
of
the
royal
family
five
of
them
the
sons
of
michal
his
own
former
wife
samuel
xxi
the
whole
transaction
was
a
formal
recognition
of
the
gibeonites
as
a
separate
people
there
is
no
intimation
that
they
served
families
or
individuals
of
the
israelites
but
only
the
house
of
god
or
the
tabernacle
this
was
established
first
at
gilgal
a
day
journey
from
the
cities
of
the
gibeonites
and
then
at
shiloh
nearly
two
days
journey
from
them
where
it
continued
about
years
during
all
this
period
the
gibeonites
inhabited
their
ancient
cities
and
territory
only
a
few
comparatively
could
have
been
absent
from
their
cities
at
any
one
time
in
attendance
on
the
tabernacle
whenever
allusion
is
made
to
them
in
the
history
the
main
body
are
spoken
of
as
it
is
preposterous
to
suppose
that
their
tabernacle
services
could
have
furnished
employment
for
all
the
inhabitants
of
these
four
cities
one
of
them
was
a
great
city
as
one
of
the
royal
cities
so
large
that
a
confederacy
of
five
kings
apparently
the
most
powerful
in
the
land
was
deemed
necessary
for
its
destruction
it
is
probable
that
the
men
were
divided
into
classes
and
thus
ministered
at
the
tabernacle
in
rotation
each
class
a
few
days
or
weeks
at
a
time
this
service
was
their
to
the
israelites
rendered
for
the
privilege
of
residence
and
protection
under
their
government
no
service
seems
to
have
been
required
of
the
as
these
gibeonites
were
canaanites
and
as
they
had
greatly
exasperated
the
israelites
by
impudent
imposition
hypocrisy
and
lying
we
might
assuredly
expect
that
they
would
reduce
to
the
condition
of
chattels
and
property
if
there
was
case
in
which
god
permitted
them
to
do
so
throughout
the
mosaic
system
god
warns
them
against
holding
their
servants
in
such
a
condition
as
they
were
held
in
by
the
how
often
are
the
israelites
pointed
back
to
the
grindings
of
their
what
motives
to
the
exercise
of
justice
and
kindness
towards
their
servants
are
held
out
to
their
fears
in
threatened
judgements
to
their
hopes
in
promised
good
and
to
all
within
them

could
feel
by
those
oft
repeated
words
of
tenderness
and
terror
for

of

waking
anew
the
memory
of

anguish

wrath
that
avenged
them

the
argument
derived
from
the
condition
of
the
israelites
in
egypt
and
god
condemnation
of
it
may
be
appreciated
it
is
important
that
the
egyptian
bondage
should
be
analyzed

to
ascertain
of
what
rights
the
israelites
were
plundered

they

skilled

ex

and
held
their

independently
and
the
egyptians
seem
to
have
regarded
them
as

infer
from
the
fact
that
there
is
no
intimation
that
the
egyptians
dispossessed
them
of
their

or
took
away
their

or

of
agriculture
or
any
article
of
property
seems
to
have
been
exacted
from
none
but
adult
nothing
is
said
from
which
the
bond
service
of
females
could
be
inferred
the
hiding
of
moses
three
months
by
his
mother
and
the
payment
of

to
her
by
pharaoh
daughter
go
against
such
a
supposition
ex

so
far
from
being
fed
upon
a
given
allowance
their
food
was
abundant
and
had
great
variety

sat

did
eat
bread

the
full
ex
xvi

they
did
eat

the
great
body
of
the
people
were
not
in
the

the
egyptians
we
from
the
fact
that
the
extent
and
variety
of
their
own
possessions
together
with
such
a
cultivation
of
their
crops
as
would
provide
them
with
bread
and
such
care
of
their
immense
flocks
and
herds
as
would
secure
their
profitable
increase
must
have
furnished
constant
employment
for
the
main
body
of
the
nation
during
the
plague
of
darkness
god
informs
us
that
all
the
children
of
israel
had
light
in
their
dwellings
we
infer
that
they
were
to
enjoy

it
seems
improbable
that
the
making
of
brick
the
only
service
named
during
the
latter
part
of
their
sojourn
in

could
have
furnished
permanent
employment
for
the
bulk
of
the
nation
see
also
ex
iv
besides
when
eastern
nations
employed
tributaries
it
was
as
now
in
the
use
of
the
levy
requiring
them
to
furnish
a
given
quota
drafted
off
periodically
so
that
comparatively
but
a
small
portion
of
the
nation
would
be
absent
any
one
probably
there
was
the
same
requisition
upon
the
israelites
for
part
of
the
proceeds
of
their
labor
that
was
laid
upon
the
egyptians
see
xlvii
instead
of
taking
it
out
of
their
goshen
being
better
for
than
crops
they
exacted
it
of
them
in
brick
making
and
it
is
quite
probable
that
only
the
israelites
were
required
to
work
for
the
egyptians
at
all
the
wealthier
being
able
to
pay
their
tribute
in
money

this
was
the

all
these
held
independently

regarded
by
them
as
inviolable
are
our
female
slaves
free
from
all
exactions
of
labor
and
liabilities
of
outrage
and
whenever
employed
are
they
paid
wages

much

a

with

a
system
in

with
which
the

of
egypt
dwindles
to

those
believe
who
can
that
god
gave
his
people
permission
to
hold
human
beings
robbed
of
their
rights
while
he
threatened
them
with
wrath
to
the
uttermost
if
they
practised
the
oppression
of
egypt
which
robbed
its
victims
of
only
the
and
of
their
rights
and
left
the
unplundered
even
of
these
what
god
divided
against
when
he
had
just
turned
egypt
into
a
funeral
pile

his
curse
yet
blazed
upon
her
unburied
dead

his
bolts
still
hissed
amidst
her
slaughter
and
the
smoke
of
her
torment
went
upwards
because
she
had
robbed
the
poor
did
he
license
the
victims
of
robbery
to
rob
the
poor
of
all
as
did
he
a
system
tenfold
more
grinding
than
that
for
which
he
had
just
hurled
pharaoh
headlong
and
cloven
down
his
princes

overwhelmed
his
hosts

blasted
them
with
his
thunder

to
meet
them
at

coming
having
touched
upon
the
general
topics
which
we
design
to
include
in
this
inquiry
we
proceed
to
examine
various
scripture
facts
and
passages
which
will
doubtless
be
set
in
array
against
the
foregoing
conclusions
objections
considered
the
advocates
of
slavery
are
always
at
their
wits
end
when
they
try
to
press
the
bible
into
their
service
every
movement
shows
that
they
are
their
odd
conceits
and
ever
varying
shifts
their
forced
constructions
lacking
even
plausibility
their
bold
assumptions
and
blind
guesswork
not

proclaim
their
desperate
but
themselves
some
of
the

defences
thrown
around
slavery
by
ministers
of
the
gospel
do
so
torture
common
sense
scripture
and
historical
fact
that
it
were
hard
to
tell
whether
absurdity
fatuity
ignorance
or
blasphemy
predominates
in
compound
each
strives
so
lustily
for
the
mastery
it
may
be
set
down
a
drawn

often
has

set
up
in

this
prophecy
of
noah
is
the
of
slaveholders
and
they
never
venture
abroad
without
it
it
is
a
for
sudden
occasion
a
keepsake
to
dote
over
a
charm
to
opposition
and
a
magnet
to
attract
whatsoever
worketh
abomination
or
maketh
a
lie
but
closely
as
they
cling
to
it
cursed

canaan
is
a
poor

to
stupify
a
throbbing
conscience
a
mocking
lullaby
vainly
wooing
slumber
to
unquiet
tossings
and
crying
peace
be
still
where
god
wakes
war
and
breaks
his
thunders
those
who
plead
the
curse
on
canaan
to
justify
negro
slavery
all
the
points
in
debate
that
the
condition
prophesied
was
rather
than
the
mere
of
to
others
and
that
it
was
the
bondage
of
rather
than
the
condition
of
a
to
another
and
in
sense
its
that
the
of
crime
it
that
it
grants
absolution
to
those
whose
crimes
fulfil
it
if
it
does
not
transform
the
crimes
into
how
piously
the
pharaohs
might
have
quoted
prophecy
to
abraham
seed
shall
be
in
bondage
and
they
shall
afflict
them
for
four
hundred
and
then
what
were
those
that
crucified
the
lord
of
glory
that
the
africans
are
descended
from
canaan
whereas
africa
was
peopled
from
egypt
and
ethiopia
and
mizraim
settled
egypt
and
cush
ethiopia
see
x
for
the
location
and
boundaries
of
posterity
so
on
the
assumption
that
african
slavery
fulfils
the
prophecy
a
curse
pronounced
upon
one
people
is
quoted
to
justify
its
infliction
upon
another
perhaps
it
may
be
argued
that
canaan
includes
all
ham
posterity
if
so
the
prophecy
has
not
been
fulfilled
the
other
sons
of
ham
settled
the
egyptian
and
assyrian
empires
and
conjointly
with
shem
the
persian
and
afterward
to
some
extent
the
grecian
and
roman
the
history
of
these
nations
gives
no
verification
of
the
prophecy
whereas
the
history
of
canaan
descendants
for
more
than
three
thousand
years
is
a
record
of
its
fulfilment
first
they
were
made
tributaries
by
the
israelites
then
canaan
was
the
servant
of
shem
afterward
by
the
medes
and
persians
then
canaan
was
the
servant
of
shem
and
in
part
of
the
other
sons
of
ham
afterward
by
the
macedonians
grecians
and
romans
successively
then
canaan
was
the
servant
of
japhet
mainly
and
secondarily
of
the
other
sons
of
ham
finally
they
were
subjected
by
the
ottoman
dynasty
where
they
yet
remain
thus
canaan
is
the
servant
of
shem
and
japhet
and
the
other
sons
of
ham
but
it
may
still
be
objected
that
though
canaan
is
the
only
one
in
the
curse
yet
the
and
verses
show
that
it
was
pronounced
upon
the
posterity
of
ham
in
general
ham
the
father
of
canaan
saw
the
nakedness
of
his
father
and
told
his
two
brethren

in
verse

and
japhet

their
father
with
a
garment
verse
noah
awoke
from
his

and
knew
what
his
younger
son
had
done
unto

and
it
is
argued
that
this
younger
son
can
not
be
as
he
was
not
the
but
the
of
noah
and
therefore
it
must
be
we
answer
whoever
that
was
or
whatever
he
did
alone
was
named
in
the
curse
besides
the
hebrew

if

what
propriety
in
calling

the
order
in
which
noah
sons
are
always
mentioned
makes
ham
the
and
not
the

if
it
be
said
that
bible
usage
is
variable
and
that
the
order
of
birth
is
not
always
preserved
in
enumerations
the
reply
is
that
enumeration
in
the
order
of

is
the
in
any
other
order
the

if
the
younger
member

it

probably

nothing
in

the
idea

follows
the

even
if
the

were
the
descendants

the
assumption
that
their

prophecy
lacks
even
plausibility
for
only
a
mere
of
the
inhabitants
of

at
any
one

been

of

the
objector
say
in

that
a

of
the
africans
have
always

is
false
in

zealously
bruited

argument

he

not
unto

a
man

arguments
drawn
from
the
mosaic
system
in
support
of
slavery
originate
in
a
misconception
both
of
its
genius
a
and
of
the
design
and
scope
of
its
most
simple
provisions
the
verses
quoted
above
afford
an
illustration
in
point
what
was
the
design
of
this
regulation
was
it
to
grant
masters
an
indulgence
to
beat
servants
with
impunity
and
an
assurance
that
if
they
beat
them
to
death
the
offence
would
not
be
this
is
substantially
what
some
modern
doctors
tell
us
what
deity
do
such
men
worship
some
moloch
enthroned
on
human
hecatombs
and
snuffing
carnage
for
incense

he
who
thundered
out
from

to

in

the
detail
gone
into
in

verses

is
manifestly
to
enable
the
judges
to
get
at
the
of
the
action
and
find
out
whether
the
master
to
kill
if
a
man
smite
his
servant
with
a

a
clue

no

be
inferred
for

hardly

for

if
the

dies
his
then
the
unfitness
of

in

is
point
blank

him

point

the
sentence
he
shall
be

the

is
plain
and
strong
but
if
he
continued

of

with
the

used
and
the
fact
that
the
master
had
a
pecuniary
interest
in

his
all
made
out
a
strong
case
of
circumstantial
evidence
showing
that
the
master
did
not

and
required
a
corresponding
decision
and
sentence
a
single
remark
on
the
word
punished
in
exodus
xxi
the
hebrew
word
here
rendered
is
so
rendered
in
another
yet
it
occurs
times
in
the
old
testament
in
almost
every
instance
it
is
translated
in
a
few
take
or
and
in
this
instance
alone
as
it
stands
in
our
translation
the
pronoun
preceding
it
refers
to
the
the
in
the
verse
is
to
be
and
in
the
to
be
punished
whereas
the
preceding
pronoun
refers
neither
to
the
nor
to
the
but
to
the
and
the
word
rendered
should
have
been
rendered
the
meaning
is
this
if
a
man
smite
his
servant
or
his
maid
with
a
rod
and
he
die
under
his
hand
it
the
death
shall

be
avenged
or
literally
avenging
it
shall
be
that

the
of
the

shall
be
by
the
of

master

in

next
verse
if
he
continues
a
day
or
two
his
death
shall
not
be
avenged
by
the
of

in
that
case
the
crime
was
to
be
adjudged
and
not
as
in
the
first
instance
in
the
following
verse
another
case
of
personal
injury
is
stated
not
intentional
nor
extending
to
life
or
limb
a
mere
accidental
hurt
for
which
the
injurer
is
to
pay
sum
of
and
yet
our
translators
employ
the
same
phraseology
in
both
places
one
an
instance
of
deliberate
wanton
by
the
other
and
and
comparatively
slight
injury
of
the
inflicter
in
both
cases
they
say
the
same
thing
shall
surely
be
now
just
the
difference
which
common
sense
would
expect
to
find
in
such
cases
where
god
legislates
is
strongly
marked
in
the
original
in
the
case
of
the
servant
wilfully
murdered
god
says
it
the
death
shall
surely
be
that
is
life
of
the
wrong
doer
shall
expiate

used
in
the
old
testament

the
greatest
wrongs
are
redressed
by
devoting
the
perpetrators
whether
individuals
or
communities
to
in
the
case
of
the
injury

the
following
verse
god
says
he
shall
surely
be

shall

the
judges
determine

simple
meaning
of

to
lay

he

in
a
hundred
talents
of
this
is
the
general
use
of
the
word
and
its
primary
signification
that
the
death
of
the
servant
was
neither
imprisonment
nor
stripes
nor
amercing
the
master
in
damages

that
it
was
the

to
the

us
look
at
the
inferences
one
is
that
as

might
dispose
of

he
pleased
he
was
not
to
be
punished
if
he
destroyed
it
answer
whether
the
servant
died
under
the
master
hand
or
continued
a
day
or
two
he
was
his
master
property
and
the
objector
admits
that
in
the
case
the
master
is
to
be
surely
punished
for
destroying
own
the
other
inference
is
that
since
the
continuance
of
a
day
or
two
cleared
the
master
of
to
the
loss
of
the
slave
would
be
a
sufficient
punishment
for
inflicting
the
injury
which
caused
his
death
this
inference
makes
the
mosaic
law
false
to
its
own
principles
a
constituted
no
part
of
the
claims
of
the

where
a
person
took
the
of
another
in

the

utterly
spurned

however
large

as
to

the
doctrine
that
the
loss
of

would
be
a
penalty
to
the
desert
of
the

admits
the
his
desert
of

it

of

the

has
to
represent

we
should
have
some
for
it
but
our
dictionaries
give
us
none
why

there
is
no
such
but
the
objector
asks
would
not
the
israelites
use
their
word
if
they
spoke
of
the
slave
of
a
heathen
answer
the
servants
of
individuals
among
the
heathen
are
scarcely
ever
alluded
to
servants
or
are
spoken
of
frequently
but
so
rarely
are
their
servants
alluded
to
no
necessity
existed
even
if
they
were
slaves
for
coining
a
new
word
besides
the
fact
of
their
being
domestics
under
laws
and
proclaimed
their
their
locality
told
their
condition
so
that
in
applying
to
them
the
word
there
would
be
no
danger
of
being
misunderstood
but
if
the
israelites
had
not
only
but
besides
these
a
multitude
of
a
meaning
would
have
been
indispensable
for
purposes
of
every
day
convenience
further
the
laws
of
the
mosaic
system
were
so
many
sentinels
on
every
side
to
warn
off
foreign
practices
the
border
ground
of
canaan
was
quarantine
ground
enforcing
the
strictest
between
the
and
the
not
of
but
of
the
fact
that
the
hebrew
language
had
no
words
corresponding
to

though
not
a
conclusive
argument
is
no
slight
corroborative
ii
forever
they
shall
be
your
bondmen
this
is
quoted
to
prove
that
servants
were
to
serve
during
their
life
time
and
their
posterity
from
generation
to
generation
no
such
idea
is
contained
in
the
passage
the
word
instead
of
defining
the
length
of
service
proclaims
the
of
the
regulation
laid
down
in
the
two
verses
preceding
namely
that
their
should
be
of
the
and
not
of
the
israelites
and
it
declares
the
duration
of
that
general
provision
as
if
god
had
said
you
shall
get
your
laborers
from
the
nations
round
about
you
your
shall
always
be
of
class
of
persons
as
it
stands
in
the
original
it
is
plain
of
them
shall
ye
serve
this
is
the
literal
rendering
of
the
hebrew
words
which
in
our
version
are
translated
shall
be
your
bondmen
this
construction
is
in
keeping
with
the
whole
of
the
passage
both
thy
bondmen
and
thy
bondmaids
which
thou
shalt
have
shall
be
of
the
the
nations
that
are
round
about
you
of
them
shall
ye
buy
bondmen
and
bondmaids
moreover
of
the
children
of
the
strangers
that
do
sojourn
among
you
of
them
shall
ye
buy
the
design
of
this
passage
is
manifest
from
its
structure
it
was
to
point
out
the
of
persons
from
which
they
were
to
get
their
supply
of
servants
and
the
in
which
they
were
to
get
them
that
refers
to
the
permanent
relations
of
a
rather
than
to
the
services
of
is
a
fair
inference
from
the
form
of
the
expression
they
shall
be
your
possession
ye
shall
take
as
an
inheritance
for
your
children
to
inherit
them
for
a
possession
to
say
nothing
of
the
uncertainty
of
surviving
those
whom
they
are
to
live
the
language
used
applies
more
naturally
to
a
of
people
than
to
servants
but
suppose
it
otherwise
still
service
could
not
be
argued
from
the
term
the
ninth
and
tenth
verses
of
the
same
chapter

it
absolutely
by
the
jubilee
shall
thou
cause
the
trumpet
of
the
jubilee
to

on
the
tenth
day
of

seventh
month

day
of

shall
ye
make
the
trumpet
sound
all

and
ye
shall
hallow
the
fiftieth
year
and
proclaim
liberty
throughout
all
the
land
all
inhabitants
it
may
be
objected
that
inhabitants
here
means
inhabitants
alone
the
command
is
proclaim
liberty
throughout
all
the
land
unto
all
inhabitants
besides
in
the
sixth
verse
there
is
an
enumeration
of
the
different
classes
of
the
inhabitants
in
which
servants
and
strangers
are
included

the

of

ushered
in
by
the

what
was
the
design
of
these
institutions
the
day
of

prefigured
the
atonement
of

and
the

of

and
did
they
prefigure

of

and
people
and
nation
to
deny
that
the
blessings
of
the
jubilee
extended
to
the
servants
from
the
makes
christianity
it
not
only
eclipses
the
glory
of
the
gospel
but
strikes
out
the
sun
the
refusal
to
release
servants
at
the
sound
of
the
jubilee
trumpet
falsified
and
disannulled
a
grand
leading
type
of
the
atonement
and
thus
libelled
the
doctrine
of
christ
redemption
finally
even
if
did
refer
to
the
length
of
service
we
have
ample
precedents
for
limiting
the
term
by
the
jubilee
the
same
word
is
used
to
define
the
length
of
time
for
which
those
servants
were
held
who
refused
to
go
out
in
the
year
and
all
admit
that
their
term
of
service
did
not
go
beyond
the
jubilee
ex
xxi
deut

the
verse
of
the
same
chapter
is
quoted
to
prove
that
in
the
verse
extends
beyond
the
jubilee

not
be

the
land
is
as
it
would
hardly
be

we
repeat
that

not
that

it
is
not
affected
by
the
jubilee
so
the
objection
does
not
touch
the
argument
but
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
show
that
it
is
equally
harmless
against
any
other
argument
drawn
from
the
use
of
forever
in
the
verse
for
the
word
there
used
is
meaning
the

that
may
be

in

the
question

the

were
a

been
already
discussed

the
land

the
of
the
israelites
answer
in
the
sense
of
it
to
live
in
what
sense
were
the
israelites
to
these
nations
and
as
an
for
their
children
we
answer
they
possessed
them
as
permanent
source
of
supply
for
domestic
or
household
servants
and
this
relation
to
these
nations
was
to
go
down
to
posterity
as
a
standing
regulation
a
national
usage
respecting
them

the
certainty
and

from
the
fact
that
only
class
of
the
servants
is
called
it
is
sagely
inferred
that
servants
of
the
class
were
for
their
labor
that
is
that
while
god
thundered
anathemas
against
those
who
used
their
neighbor
service
he
granted
a
special
indulgence
to
his
chosen
people
to
seize
persons
force
them
to
work
and
rob
them
of
earnings
provided
always
in
selecting
their
victims
they
spared
the
gentlemen
of
property
and
standing
and
pounced
only
upon
the
and
the
people
the
inference
that
is
synonimous
with
and
that
those
servants
not
hired
were
for
their
labor
is
a
the
meaning
of
the
english
verb
is
as
every
one
knows
to
procure
for
a
temporary
use
at
a
curtain
price
to
engage
a
person
to
service
for
wages
that
is
also
the
meaning
of
the
hebrew
word
service
and
generally
for
a
object
is
inseparable
from
its
meaning
it
is
never
used
when
the
procurement
of
service
for
a
long
period
is
spoken
of
now
we
ask
would
servants
those
who
constituted
an
integral
and
stationary
part
of
the
family
have
been
designated
by
the
same
term
that
marks
servants
the
distinctions
made
on
this
subject
are
as
familiar
as
in
many
families
the
domestics
perform
only
such
labor
as
every
day
brings
along
with
it
the
work
whatever
is
merely
as
the
washing
of
a
family
is
done
by
persons
expressly
for
the
in
such
families
the
familiar
distinction
between
the
two
classes
is
servants
or
domestics
and
hired
help
not
help
classes
are
one
is
permanent
the
other
occasional
and
temporary
and
therefore
in
this
case
called
to
suppose
a
servant
robbed
of
his
earnings
because
when
spoken
of
he
is
not
called
a
servant
is
profound
induction
if
i
employ
a
man
at
twelve
dollars
a
month
to
work
my
farm
he
is
my
hired
man
but
if
instead
of
giving
him
so
much
a
month
i
him
such
a
portion
of
the
or
in
other
words
if
he
works
my
farm
on
shares
he
is
no
longer
my
man
every
farmer
knows
that
designation
is
not
applied
to
him
yet
he
works
the
same
farm
in
the
same
way
at
the
same
times
and
with
the
same
teams
and
tools
and
does
the
same
amount
of
work
in
the
year
and
perhaps
clears
twenty
dollars
a
month
instead
of
the
twelve
paid
him
while
he
was
my
laborer
now
as
the
technic
hired
is
no
longer
used
to
designate
him
and
as
he
still
labors
on
my
farm
suppose
my
neighbors
gather
in
conclave
and
from
such
ample
premises
sagely
infer
that
since
he
is
no
longer
my
hired
laborer
i
him
of
his
earnings

with
all
the
gravity
of

they

proverbial

the
superior

no

cases

plenipotentiary

abraham
besought
eliezer
his

to
take

oath

he

of

the

power

servant
took

the
camels
of
his
master
all

goods
of

xxiv
the
reason
assigned
for
taking

is
not
that
such

that

had
discretionary
control
servants
had
also

luke

so
in
the
parable
of
the
talents
the
master
seems
to
have
set
up
each
of
his
servants
in
trade
with
considerable
capital
one
of
them
could
not
have
had
less
than
eight
thousand
dollars
the
parable
of
the
unjust
steward
is
another
illustration
luke
xvi
he
evidently
was
entrusted
with
large
power
was
accused
of
wasting
his
goods
and
manifestly
regulated
with
his
master
debtors
the
of
settlement
such
trusts
were
never
reposed
in
servants
the
inferior
condition
of
servants
is
illustrated
in
the
parable
of
the
prodigal
son
when
the
prodigal
perishing
with
hunger
among
the
swine
and
husks
came
to
himself
his
proud
heart
broke
i
will
arise
he
cried
and
go
to
my
father
and
then
to
assure
his
father
of
the
depth
of
his
humility
resolved
to
add
imploringly
make
me
as
one
of
thy
servants
it
need
not
be
remarked
that
if
servants
were
the
class
to
apply
for
the
situation
and
press
the
suit
savored
little
of
that
sense
of
unworthiness
that
seeks
the
dust
with
hidden
face
and
cries
unclean
unhumbled
nature
or
if
it
falls
clings
fast
where
first
it
may
humility
sinks
of
its
own
weight
and
in
the
lowest
deep
digs
lower
the
design
of
the
parable
was
to
illustrate
on
the
one
hand
the
joy
of
god
as
he
beholds
afar
off
the
returning
sinner
seeking
an
injured
face
who
runs
to
clasp
and
bless
him
with
an
unchiding
welcome
and
on
the
other
the
contrition
of
the
penitent
turning
homeward
with
tears
from
his
wanderings
his
stricken
spirit
breaking
with
its
he
sobs
aloud
the
lowest
place
lowest
i
can
abide
no
other
or
in
those
inimitable
words
i
have
sinned
against
heaven
and
in
thy
sight
and
no
more
worthy
to
be
called
thy
son
make
me
as
one
of
hired
the
supposition
that
servants
were
the
class
takes
from
the
parable
an
element
of
winning
beauty
and
pathos
it
is
manifest
to
every
careful
student
of
the
bible
that
class
of
servants
was
on
terms
of
equality
with
the
children
and
other
members
of
the
family
hence
the
force
of
declaration
gal
iv
now
i
say
unto
you
that
the
heir
so
long
as
he
is
a
child
differeth
nothing
from
a
servant
he
be
lord
of
all
if
this
were
the
class
the
prodigal
was
a
sorry
specimen
of
humility
would
our
lord
have
put
such
language
into
the
lips
of
one
held
up
by
himself
as
a
model
of
gospel
humility
to
illustrate
its
lowliness
its
conscious
destitution
of
all
merit
and
deep
sense
of
all
ill
desert
if
this
is
put
it
on
stilts
and
set
it
a
strutting
while
pride
takes
lessons
and
blunders
in
apeing
it
here
let
it
be
observed
that
both
israelites
and
strangers
belonged
indiscriminately
to
class
of
the
servants
the
and
the
that
those
in
the
former
class
whether
jews
or
strangers
were
in
higher
estimation
and
rose
to
honors
and
authority
in
the
family
circle
which
were
not
conferred
on
servants
has
been
already
shown
it
should
be
added
however
that
in
the
enjoyment
of
privileges
merely
and
the
hired
servants
from
the
were
more
favored
than
either
the
hired
or
the
bought
servants
from
the
no
one
from
the
strangers
however
wealthy
or
highly
endowed
was
eligible
to
the
highest
office
nor
could
he
own
the
soil
this
last
disability
seems
to
have
been
one
reason
for
the
different
periods
of
service
required
of
the
two
classes
of
bought
servants
the
israelites
and
the
strangers
the
israelite
was
to
serve
six
years
the
stranger
until
the
jubilee
a
footnote
a
both
classes
may
with
propriety
be
called
servants
even
the
bought
israelite
when
his
service
is
contrasted
with
the
brief
term
of
the
hired
servant
as
the
strangers
could
not
own
the
soil
nor
even
houses
except
within
walled
towns
most
of
them
would
choose
to
attach
themselves
permanently
to
israelitish
families
those
strangers
who
were
wealthy
or
skilled
in
manufactures
instead
of
becoming
servants
themselves
would
need
servants
for
their
own
use
and
as
inducements
for
the
strangers
to
become
servants
to
the
israelites
were
greater
than
persons
of
their
own
nation
could
hold
out
to
them
these
wealthy
strangers
would
naturally
procure
the
poorer
israelites
for
servants
see
levit
xxv
in
a
word
such
was
the
political
condition
of
the
strangers
the
jewish
polity
furnished
a
strong
motive
to
them
to
become
servants
thus
incorporating
themselves
with
the
nation
and
procuring
those
social
and
religious
privileges
already
enumerated
and
for
their
children
in
the
second
generation
a
permanent
inheritance
this
last
was
a
regulation
of
later
date
ezekiel
xlvii
indeed
the
structure
of
the
whole
mosaic
polity
was
a
virtual
bounty
offered
to
those
who
would
become
permanent
servants
and
merge
in
the
jewish
system
their
distinct
nationality
none
but
the
monied
aristocracy
among
them
would
be
likely
to
decline
such
offers
for
various
reasons
this
class
the
servants
bought
from
the
strangers
would
prefer
a
service
they
would
thus
more
effectually
become
absorbed
into
the
national
circulation
and
identify
their
interests
with
those
in
whose
gift
were
all
things
desirable
for
themselves
and
brighter
prospects
for
their
children
on
the
other
hand
the
israelites
owning
all
the
soil
and
an
inheritance
of
land
being
a
sort
of
sacred
possession
to
hold
it
free
of
incumbrance
was
with
every
israelite
a
delicate
point
both
of
family
honor
and
personal
character

hence
to
forego
the
of
one
inheritance
the
division
of
the
paternal
domain
or
to
be
restrained
from
its
after
having
acceded
to
it
was
a
burden
grievous
to
be
borne
to
mitigate
as
much
as
possible
such
a
calamity
the
law
instead
of
requiring
the
israelite
to
continue
a
servant
until
the
jubilee
released
him
at
the
end
six
years
a
as
during
that
time
if
of
the
first
class
the
partition
of
the
patrimonial
land
might
have
taken
place
or
if
of
the
second
enough
money
might
have
been
earned
to
disencumber
his
estate
and
thus
he
might
assume
his
station
as
a
lord
of
the
soil
if
these
contingencies
had
not
occurred
then
at
the
end
of
another
six
years
the
opportunity
was
again
offered
and
in
the
same
manner
until
the
jubilee
so
while
strong
motives
urged
the
israelite
to
discontinue
his
service
as
soon
as
the
exigency
had
passed
which
induced
him
to
become
a
servant
every
consideration
impelled
the
to
his
term
of
service
and
the
same
kindness
which
dictated
the
law
of
six
years
service
for
the
israelite
assigned
as
the
general
rule
a
much
longer
period
to
the
gentile
servant
who
instead
of
being
tempted
to
a
brief
service
had
every
inducement
to
protract
the

a
another
reason
for
protracting
the
service
until
the
seventh
year
seems
to
have
been
its
coincidence
with
other
arrangements
and
provisions
inseparable
from
the
jewish
economy
that
period
was
a
favorite
one
in
the
mosaic
system
its
pecuniary
responsibilities
social
relations
and
general
internal
structure
if
not
upon
a
septennial
scale
were
variously
modified
by
the
lapse
of
the
period
another
reason
doubtless
was
that
as
those
israelites
who
became
servants
through
poverty
would
not
sell
themselves
except
as
a
last
resort
when
other
expedients
to
recruit
their
finances
had
failed
see
lev
xxv
their
proclaimed
such
a
state
of
their
affairs
as
demanded
the
labor
of
course
of
fully
to
reinstate
them
it
is
important
to
a
clear
understanding
of
the
whole
subject
to
keep
in
mind
that
adult
jews
ordinarily
became
servants
only
as
a
temporary
expedient
to
relieve
themselves
from
embarrassment
and
ceased
to
be
such
when
that
object
was
effected
the
poverty
that
forced
them
to
it
was
a
calamity
and
their
service
was
either
a
means
of
relief
or
a
measure
of
prevention
it
was
not
pursued
as
a
but
resorted
to
on
emergencies
a
sort
of
episode
in
the
main
scope
of
their
lives
whereas
with
the
strangers
it
was
a
pursued
not
merely
as
a
of
bettering
their
own
condition
and
prospectively
that
of
their
posterity
but
also
as
an
for
its
own
sake
conferring
on
them
privileges
and
a
social
estimation
not
otherwise
attainable
we
see
from
the
foregoing
why
servants
purchased
from
the
heathen
are
called
by
way
of
distinction
servants
not
as
our
translators
have
it
they
followed
it
as
a
their
term
of
service
was
than
that
of
the
other
class
as
a
class
they
doubtless
greatly
outnumbered
the
israelitish
servants
all
the
strangers
that
dwelt
in
the
land
were
to
the
israelites
required
to
pay
an
annual
tribute
to
the
government
either
in
money
or
in
public
service
which
was
called
a

the

with
the

command
is
repeated
in
the
verse
and
applied
to
the
distinction
between
the
servants
of
jewish
and
those
of
gentile
extraction
and
forbids
the
overlooking
of
distinctive
jewish
peculiarities
so
vital
to
an
israelite
as
to
make
the
violation
of
them
in
the
extreme
while
to
the
servants
from
the
strangers
whose
previous
habits
and
associations
differed
so
widely
from
those
of
the
israelite
these
same
things
would
be
deemed
slight
disabilities
it
may
be
remarked
here
that
the
political
and
other
disabilities
of
the
strangers
which
were
the
distinctions
growing
out
of
a
different
national
descent
and
important
to
the
preservation
of
national
characteristics
and
to
the
purity
of
national
worship
do
not
seem
to
have
effected
at
all
the
estimation
in
which
this
class
of
servants
was
held
they
were
regarded
according
to
their
character
and
worth
as
irrespective
of
their
foreign
origin
employments
and
political
condition
the
common
construction
put
upon
the
expression
with
and
an
inference
drawn
from
it
have
an
air
so
oracular
as
quite
to
overcharge
risibles
of
ordinary
calibre
if
such
an
effect
were
not
forestalled
by
its
impiety
it
is
interpreted
to
mean
you
shall
not
make
him
an
article
of
property
you
shall
not
force
him
to
work
and
rob
him
of
his
earnings
you
shall
not
make
him
a
chattel
and
strip
him
of
legal
protection
so
much
for
the
interpretation
the
inference
is
like
unto
it
viz
since
the
command
forbade
such
outrages
upon
the
it
permitted
and
the
infliction
of
them
upon
the
such
impious
and
shallow
smattering
captivates
two
classes
of
minds
the
one
by
its
flippancy
the
other
by
its
blasphemy
and
both
by
the
strong
scent
of
its
unbridled
license
what
boots
it
to
reason
against
such
rampant
affinities
in
exodus
chap
i
it
is
said
that
the
egyptians
made
the
children
of
israel
to
with
rigor
and
all
their
wherein
they
made
them
was
with
rigor
the
rigor
here
spoken
of
is
affirmed
of
the
of
extorted
from
them
and
the
of
the
exaction
this
form
of
expression
with
is
never
applied
to
the
service
of
servants
either
under
the
patriarchal
or
the
mosaic
systems
nor
is
any
other
form
of
expression
ever
used
either
equivalent
to
it
or
at
all
similar
the
phrase
thou
shalt
not
rule
over
him
with
rigor
used
in
leviticus
xxv
does
not
prohibit
unreasonable
exactions
of
labor
nor
inflictions
of
personal
cruelty
were
provided
against
but
it
forbids
confounding
the
distinctions
between
a
jew
and
a
stranger
by
assigning
the
former
to
the
same
grade
of
service
for
the
same
term
of
time
and
under
the

national
and
political
disabilities
as
the
latter
we
are
now
prepared
to
survey
at
a
glance
the
general
condition
of
the
different
classes
of
servants
with
the
modifications
peculiar
to
each
class

were

persons
character

and
social
relations
all
were
all
were
for

labor
all
were
released
from

regular
labor
nearly
half
of
the
days
in
each
all
were
furnished
with
stated
none
in
either
class

in
any
sense
articles
of
all
were
regarded
as
with
the
rights
interests
hopes
and
destinies
of
in
these
respects
the
circumstances
of
classes
of
servants
among
the
israelites
were
not
only
similar
but
and
so
far
forth
they
formed
but
one
class
ii
different
classes
of
servants
this
class
consisted
both
of
israelites
and
strangers
their
employments
were
different
the
was
an
agricultural
servant
the
stranger
was
a

servant
and
in
some
instances
both
were
procured
to
serve
an
emergency

lived
in
their
own
families
their
wages
were
and
they
were
paid
when
their
work
was
done
as
a
of
the
hired
were
less
loved
trusted
honored
and
promoted
than
any
other
servants
including
those
born
in
the
house
this
class
also
was
composed
both
of
israelites
and
strangers
the
same
general
difference
obtaining
in
their
kinds
of
employment
as
was
noticed
before
both
were
paid
in
advance
a
and
neither
was
temporary
footnote
a
the
payment
doubtless
lessened
considerably
the
price
of
the
purchase
the
servant
thus
having
the
use
of
the
money
from
the
beginning
and
the
master
assuming
all
the
risks
of
life
and
health
for
labor
at
the
expiration
of
the
six
years
contract
the
master
having
experienced
no
loss
from
the
risk
incurred
at
the
making
of
it
was
obliged
by
law
to
release
the
servant
with
a
liberal
gratuity
the
reason
assigned
for
this
is
he
hath
been
worth
a
double
hired
servant
unto
thee
in
serving
thee
six
years
as
if
it
had
been
said
he
has
now
served
out
his
time
and
as
you
have
experienced
no
loss
from
the
risks
of
life
and
ability
to
labor
which
you
incurred
in
the
purchase
and
which
lessened
the
price
and
as
by
being
your
permanent
servant
for
six
years
he
has
saved
you
all
the
time
and
trouble
of
looking
up
and
hiring
laborers
on
emergencies
therefore
thou
shalt
furnish
him
liberally
the
israelitish
servant
in
most
instances
was
released
after
six
years
the
continued
until
the
jubilee
the
stranger
was
a
servant
continuing
until
the
jubilee
besides
these
distinctions
between
jewish
and
gentile
bought
servants
a
marked
distinction
obtained
between
different
classes
of
jewish
bought
servants
ordinarily
during
their
term
of
service
they
were
merged
in
their
master
family
and
like
the
wife
and
children
of
the
master
subject
to
his
authority
and
of
course
like
them
protected
by
law
from
its
abuse
but
class
of
the
jewish
bought
servants
was
a
marked
exception
the
obliged
by
poverty
to
leave
his
possession
and
sell
himself
as
a
servant
did
not
thereby
affect
his
family
relations
or
authority
nor
subject
himself
as
an
inferior
to
the
control
of
his
master
though
dependent
upon
him
for
employment
in
this
respect
his
condition
differed
from
that
of
the
main
body
of
jewish
bought
servants
which
seems
to
have
consisted
of
those
who
had
not
yet
come
into
possession
of
their
inheritance
or
of
those
who
were
dislodging
from
it
an
incumbrance
having
dwelt
so
much
at
length
on
this
part
of
the
subject
the
patience
may
well
be
spared
further
details
we
close
it
with
a
suggestion
or
two
which
may
serve
as
a
solvent
of
some
minor
difficulties
if
such
remain
i
it
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
classes
of
servants
the
israelite
and
the
stranger
not
only
enjoyed
natural
and
religious
but
the
civil
and
political
enjoyed
by
those
of
their
own
people
who
were
servants
if
israelites
all
rights
belonging
to
israelites
were
theirs
if
from
the
strangers
the
same
political
privileges
enjoyed
by
those
wealthy
strangers
who
bought
and
held
servants
they
also
shared
common
with
the
political
disabilities
which
appertained
to
strangers
whether
the
servants
of
jewish
masters
or
the
masters
of
jewish
servants
ii
the
disabilities
of
the
servants
from
the
strangers
were
exclusively
and
they
in
common
with
all
strangers
not
own
the
they
were
to
civil
they
were
assigned
to
less
honorable
than
those
in
which
israelitish
servants
engaged
agriculture
being
regarded
as
fundamental
to
the
prosperity
and
even
to
the
existence
of
the
state
other
employments
were
in
far
less
repute
and
deemed
finally
the
condition
of
the
strangers
whether
servants
or
masters
was
as
it
respected
political
privileges
much
like
that
of
unnaturalized
foreigners
in
the
united
states
no
matter
how
great
their
wealth
or
intelligence
or
moral
principle
or
love
for
our
institutions
they
can
neither
go
to
the
nor
own
the
soil
nor
be
eligible
to
office
let
a
native
american
who
has
always
enjoyed
these
privileges
be
suddenly
bereft
of
them
and
loaded
with
the
disabilities
of
an
alien
and
what
to
the
foreigner
would
be
a
light
matter
to
would
be
the
severity
of
the
recent
condition
of
the
jews
and
catholics
in
england
is
a
still
better
illustration
of
the
political
condition
of
the
strangers
in
israel
rothschild
the
late
english
banker
though
the
richest
private
citizen
in
the
world
and
perhaps
master
of
scores
of
english
servants
who
sued
for
the
smallest
crumbs
of
his
favor
was
as
a
subject
of
the
government
inferior
to
the
veriest
scavenger
among
them
suppose
an
englishman
of
the
established
church
were
by
law
deprived
of
power
to
own
the
soil
made
ineligible
to
office
and
deprived
unconditionally
of
the
electoral
franchise
would
englishmen
think
it
a
misapplication
of
language
if
it
were
said
the
government
rules
over
that
man
with
rigor
and
yet
his
life
limbs
property
reputation
conscience
all
his
social
relations
the
disposal
of
his
time
the
right
of
locomotion
at
pleasure
and
of
natural
liberty
in
all
respects
are
just
as
much
protected
by
law
as
the
lord
chancellor
the
same
was
true
of
all
the
strangers
within
the
gates
among
the
israelites
whether
these
strangers
were
the
servants
of
israelitish
masters
or
the
masters
of
israelitish
servants
whether
sojourners
or
bought
servants
or
born
in
the
house
or
hired
or
neither
were
protected
equally
with
the
descendants
of
finally
as
the
mosaic
system
was
a
great
compound
type
made
up
of
innumerable
fractional
ones
each
rife
with
meaning
in
doctrine
and
duty
the
practical
power
of
the
whole
depended
upon
the
exact
observance
of
those
distinctions
and
relations
which
constituted
its
significancy
hence
the
care
everywhere
shown
to
preserve
inviolate
the
distinction
between
a
of
and
a
even
when
the
stranger
was
a
proselyte
had
gone
through
the
initiatory
ordinances
entered
the
congregation
and
become
incorporated
with
the
israelites
by
family
alliance
the
regulation
laid
down
in
exodus
xxi
is
an
illustration
if
thou
buy
an
hebrew
servant
six
years
shall
he
serve
and
in
the
seventh
he
shall
go
out
free
for
nothing
if
he
came
in
by
himself
he
shall
go
out
by
himself
if
he
were
married
then
his
wife
shall
go
out
with
him
if
his
master
have
given
him
a
wife
and
she
have
borne
him
sons
or
daughters
the
wife
and
her
children
shall
be
her
master
and
he
shall
go
out
by
himself
and
if
the
servant
should
plainly
say
i
love
my
master
my
wife
and
my
children
i
will
not
go
out
free
then
his
master
shall
bring
him
unto
the
judges
he
shall
also
bring
him
to
the
door
or
unto
the
and
his
master
shall
bore
his
ear
through
with
an
awl
and
he
shall
serve
him
forever
in
this
case
the
israelitish
servant
whose
term
expired
in
six
years
married
one
of
his
master
female
but
the
fact
of
her
marriage
did
not
release
her
master
from
part
of
the
contract
for
her
whole
term
of
service
nor
absolve
him
from
his
legal
obligation
to
support
and
educate
her
children
nor
could
it
do
away
that
distinction
which
marked
her
national
descent
by
a
specific
and
of
service
her
marriage
did
not
impair
her
obligation
to
fulfil
part
of
the
contract
her
relations
as
a
permanent
domestic
grew
out
of
a
distinction
guarded
with
great
care
throughout
the
mosaic
system
to
permit
this
to
be
rendered
void
would
have
been
to
divide
the
system
against
itself
this
god
would
not
tolerate
nor
on
the
other
hand
would
he
permit
the
master
to
throw
off
the
responsibility
of
instructing
her
children
nor
the
care
and
expense
of
their
helpless
infancy
and
rearing
he
was
bound
to
support
and
educate
them
and
all
her
children
born
afterwards
during
her
term
of
service
the
whole
arrangement
beautifully
illustrates
that
wise
and
tender
regard
for
the
interests
of
all
the
parties
concerned
which
arrays
the
mosaic
system
in
robes
of
glory
and
causes
it
to
shine
as
the
sun
in
the
kingdom
of
our
father
by
this
law
the
children
had
secured
to
them
a
tender
care
if
the
husband
loved
his
wife
and
children
he
could
compel
his
master
to
keep
him
whether
he
had
any
occasion
for
his
services
or
not
and
with
such
remuneration
as
was
provided
by
the
statute
if
he
did
not
love
them
to
be
rid
of
him
was
a
blessing
and
in
that
case
the
regulation
would
prove
an
act
for
the
relief
of
an
afflicted
family
it
is
not
by
any
means
to
be
inferred
that
the
release
of
the
servant
from
his
service
in
the
seventh
year
either
absolved
him
from
the
obligations
of
marriage
or
shut
him
out
from
the
society
of
his
family
he
could
doubtless
procure
a
service
at
no
great
distance
from
them
and
might
often
do
it
to
get
higher
wages
or
a
kind
of
employment
better
suited
to
his
taste
and
skill
or
because
his
master
might
not
have
sufficient
work
to
occupy
him
whether
he
lived
near
his
family
or
at
a
considerable
distance
the
great
number
of
days
on
which
the
law
released
servants
from
regular
labor
would
enable
him
to
spend
much
more
time
with
them
than
can
be
spent
by
most
of
the
agents
of
our
benevolent
societies
with
families
or
by
many
merchants
editors
artists
whose
daily
business
is
in
new
york
while
their
families
reside
from
ten
to
one
hundred
miles
in
the
country
we
conclude
this
inquiry
by
touching
briefly
upon
an
objection
which
though
not
formally
stated
has
been
already
set
aside
by
the
whole
tenor
of
the
foregoing
argument
it
is
this
the
slavery
of
the
canaanites
by
the
israelites
was
appointed
by
god
as
a
commutation
of
the
punishment
of
death
denounced
against
them
for
their
sins
if
the
absurdity
of
a
sentence
consigning
persons
to
and
at
the
same
time
to
perpetual
did
not
sufficiently
laugh
in
its
own
face
it
would
be
small
in
a
case
so
tempting
to
make
up
the
deficiency
by
a
general
contribution
for
it
the
mosaic
law
was
given
while
israel
was
the
and
only
statute
was
ever
given
respecting
disposition
to
be
made
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
if
the
sentence
of
death
was
first
pronounced
against
them
and
afterwards
when
where
by
whom
and
in
what
terms
was
the
commutation
and
where
is
it
recorded
grant
for
argument
sake
that
all
the
canaanites
were
sentenced
to
unconditional
extermination
as
there
was
no
reversal
of
the
sentence
how
can
a
right
to
them
be
drawn
from
such
premises
the
punishment
of
death
is
one
of
the
highest
recognitions
of
man
moral
nature
possible
it
proclaims
him
intelligent
accountable
guilty
deserving
death
for
having
done
his
utmost
to
cheapen
human
life
and
make
it
worthless
when
the
proof
of
its
priceless
value
lives
in
his
own
nature
but
to
make
him
a
cheapens
to
nothing
human
nature
and
instead
of
healing
a
wound
gives
a
death
stab
what
repair
an
injury
done
to
rational
being
in
the
robbery
of
of
its
rights
not
merely
by
robbing
it
of
but
by
annihilating
the
very
of
them
that
everlasting
distinction
between
men
and
things
to
make
a
man
a
chattel
is
not
the
but
the
of
a
being
and
so
far
as
it
goes
of
human
beings
this
commutation
of
the
punishment
of
death
into
perpetual
slavery
what
a
fortunate
discovery
alas
for
the
honor
of
deity
if
commentators
had
not
manned
the
forlorn
hope
and
rushed
to
the
rescue
of
the
divine
character
at
the
very
crisis
of
its
fate
and
by
a
timely
movement
covered
its
retreat
from
the
perilous
position
in
which
inspiration
had
carelessly
left
it
here
a
question
arises
of
sufficient
importance
for
a
separate
dissertation
but
must
for
the
present
be
disposed
of
in
a
few
paragraphs
were
the
canaanites
sentenced
by
god
to
individual
and
unconditional
extermination
that
the
views
generally
prevalent
on
this
subject
are
wrong
we
have
no
doubt
but
as
the
limits
of
this
inquiry
forbid
our
going
into
the
merits
of
the
question
so
as
to
give
all
the
grounds
of
dissent
from
the
commonly
received
opinions
the
suggestions
made
will
be
thrown
out
merely
as
queries
and
not
as
a
formal
laying
down
of
the
leading
directions
as
to
the
disposal
of
the
canaanites
are
mainly
in
the
following
passages
exod
xxiii
and
and
deut
vii
and
ix
and
xxxi
in
these
verses
the
israelites
are
commanded
to
destroy
the
canaanites
to
drive
out
consume
utterly
overthrow
put
out
dispossess
them
quest
did
these
commands
enjoin
the
unconditional
and
universal
destruction
of
the
or
merely
of
the
politic
ans
the
hebrew
word
to
destroy
signifies
as
well
as
individual
destruction
existence
equally
with
the
destruction
of
governmental
organization
equally
with
the
lives
of
the
subjects
besides
if
we
interpret
the
words
destroy
consume
overthrow
to
mean
destruction
what
meaning
shall
we
give
to
the
expressions
drive
out
before
thee
cast
out
before
thee
expel
put
out
dispossess
which
are
used
in
the
same
passages
for
a
clue
to
the
sense
in
which
the
word
destroy
is
used
see
exodus
xxiii
i
will
destroy
all
the
people
to
whom
thou
shalt
come
and
i
will
make
all
thine
enemies
their
backs
unto
here
their
were
to
their
and
the
to
be
does
this
mean
that
god
would
let
all
their
escape
but
kill
all
their
or
that
he
would
kill
all
the
people
and
then
make
them
turn
their
backs
in
flight
an
army
of
runaway
corpses
the
word
rendered
is
in
the
original
and
the
passage
mean
i
will
make
all
your
enemies
turn
their
necks
unto
you
that
is
be
to
you
as
become
their
civil
polity
state
organization
political
existence
their
idolatrous
temples
altars
images
groves
and
all
heathen
rites
in
a
word
their
whole
system
national
political
civil
and
religious
subverted
and
the
whole
people
under
again
if
these
commands
required
the
unconditional
destruction
of
all
the
of
the
canaanites
the
mosaic
law
was
at
war
with
itself
for
the
directions
relative
to
the
treatment
of
native
residents
and
sojourners
form
a
large
part
of
it
the
stranger
that
dwelleth
with
you

be
unto
you
as
one
born
among
you
and
thou
shalt
love
him
as

if
thy

poor
thou
shalt
relieve
him
yea
though
he
be
a

he

with
thee
thou
shalt
not
oppress
a
thou
shalt
not
vex
a

righteously
between
every
man
and
his
brother
and
the
that
is
with
him
ye
shall
not
respect
persons
in
judgement
ye
shall
have
one
manner
of
law
as
well
for
the
as
for
him
of
your
own
country
we
find
also
that
provision
was
made
for
them
in
the
cities
of
refuge
num
xxxv
the
gleanings
of
the
harvest
and

were
assigned
to

and
the
blessings

the

secured

instruction
provided
for
them
deut
xxxi
now
does
this
authorize
and
appoint
the
of
those
very
persons
whose
lives
and
general
interests
it
so
solicitously
protects
these
laws
were
given
to
the
israelites
long
they
entered
canaan
and
they
must
of
necessity
have
inferred
from
them
that
a
multitude
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
would
in
under
their
government
argue
that
these
commands
did
not
require
individual
of
the
canaanites
unconditionally
from
the
fact
that
the
most
pious
israelites
never
seem
to
have
so
regarded
joshua
was
selected
as
the
leader
of
israel
to
execute
god
threatenings
upon
canaan
he
had
no
power
god
commands
were
his
going
them
would
have
been
usurpation
refusing
carry
them
out
rebellion
and
treason
for
not
obeying
in
particular
and
in
a
instance
god
command
respecting
the
amalekites
saul
was
rejected
from
being
king
now
if
god
commanded
the
individual
destruction
of
all
the
canaanitish
nations
joshua
him
in
every
for
at
his
death
the
israelites
still
dwelt
among
them
and
each
nation
is
mentioned
by
name
see
judges
i
and
yet
we
are
told
that
joshua
was
full
of
the
spirit
of
the
lord
and
of
wisdom
deut
xxxiv
of
course
he
could
not
have
been
ignorant
of
the
meaning
of
those
commands
that
the
lord
was
with
him
josh
vi
and
that
he
left
nothing
undone
of
all
that
the
lord
commanded
moses
and
further
that
he
took
all
that
land
joshua
xi
also
that
the
lord
gave
unto
israel
all
the
land
which
he
swore
to
give
unto
their
fathers
and
they
possessed
it
and
dwelt
therein
and
there
not
a
of
their
enemies
before
them
the
lord
delivered
enemies
into
their
hand
how
can
this
testimony
be
reconciled
with
itself
if
we
suppose
that
the
command
to
enjoined
extermination
and
the
command
to
enjoined
the
unconditional
expulsion
of
individuals
from
the
country
rather
than
their
expulsion
from
the
or
of
it
as
the
lords
of
the
soil
it
is
true
multitudes
of
the
canaanites
were
slain
but
in
every
case
it
was
in
consequence
of
their
refusing
to
surrender
their
land
to
the
possession
of
the
israelites
not
a
solitary
case
can
be
found
in
which
a
canaanite
was
either
killed
or
driven
out
of
the
country
who
acquiesced
in
the
transfer
of
the
territory
of
canaan
and
its
sovereignty
from
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
to
the
israelites
witness
the
case
of
rahab
and
all
her
kindred
and
the
inhabitants
of
gibeon
chephirah
beeroth
and
kirjathjearim
a
the
canaanites
knew
of
the
miracles
in
egypt
at
the
red
sea
in
the
wilderness
and
at
the
passage
of
jordan
they
knew
that
their
land
had
been
transferred
to
the
israelites
as
a
judgment
upon
them
for
their
see
joshua
ii
and
ix
many
of
them
were
awed
by
these
wonders
and
made
no
resistance
to
the
confiscation
of
their
territory
others
fiercely
resisted
defied
the
god
of
the
armies
of
israel
and
came
out
to
battle
these

most
heathen

with
their
crowds
of

retainers

the
performance
of
idolatrous

as
an
illustration
of
the
meaning
generally
attached
to
these
and
similar
terms
when
applied
to
the
canaanites
in
scripture
we
refer
the
reader
to
the
history
of
the
amalekites
in
ex

god
says
i
will
utterly
put
out
the

verses
of

we
are
told
saul
smote
the
amalekites
and
took
agag
the
king
of
the
amalekites
alive
and
utterly
destroyed
all
the
people
with

have
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
lord
and
have
brought
agag

king

footnote
a
perhaps
it
will
be
objected
that
the
preservation
of
the
gibeonites
and
of
rahab
and
her
kindred
was
a
violation
of
the
command
of
god
we
answer
if
it
had
been
we
might
expect
some
such
intimation
if
god
had
straitly
commanded
them
to
all
the
canaanites
their
pledge
to
save
them
alive
was
neither
a
repeal
of
the
statute
nor
absolution
for
the
breach
of
it
if
was
the
import
of
the
command
would
god
have
permitted
such
an
act
to
pass
without
severe
rebuke
would
he
have
established
such
a
precedent
when
israel
had
hardly
passed
the
threshhold
of
canaan
and
was
then
striking
the
first
blow
of
a
half
century
war
what
if
they
passed
their
word
to
rahab
and
the
gibeonites
was
that
more
binding
upon
them
than
god
command
so
saul
seems
to
have
passed
word
to
agag
yet
samuel
hewed
him
in
pieces
because
in
saving
his
life
saul
had
violated
god
command
this
same
saul
appears
to
have
put
the
same
construction
on
the
command
to
destroy
the
inhabitants
of
canaan
that
is
generally
put
upon
it
now
we
are
told
that
he
sought
to
slay
the
gibeonites
in
his
zeal
for
the
children
of
israel
and
judah
god
sent
upon
israel
a
three
years
famine
for
it
in
assigning
the
reason
he
says
it
is
for
saul
and
his
bloody
house
because
he
slew
the
gibeonites
when
david
inquired
of
them
what
atonement
he
should
make
they
say
the
man
that
consumed
us
and
that
devised
against
us
that
we
should
the
destroyed
from
in
any
of
the
coasts
of
let
seven
of
his
sons
be
delivered

if
the
canaanites
were
devoted
by
god
to
individual
and
unconditional
extermination
to
have
employed
them
in
the
erection
of
the
temple
what
was
it
but
the
climax
of
impiety

well
might
they
pollute
its
altars
with

make
their

chapter
we
find
the
amalekites
at
war
again
marching
an
army
into

sweeping
every
thing
before
them

all
this
in
hardly
more
than
twenty
years
after
they
had
utterly
destroyed
deut
xx
will
probably
be
quoted
against
the
preceding
view
of
the
cities
of
these
people
which
the
lord
thy
god
doth
give
thee
for
an
inheritance
thou
shalt
save
alive
nothing
that
breatheth
but
thou
shalt
utterly
destroy
them
namely
the
hittites
and
the
amorites
the
canaanites
and
the
perrizites
the
hivites
and
the
jebusites
as
the
lord
thy
god
hath
commanded
we
argue
that
this
command
to
exterminate
did
not
include
all
the
individuals
of
the
canaanitish
nations
but
only
the
inhabitants
of
the
and
even
those
conditionally
for
the
following
reasons
i
only
the
inhabitants
of
are
specified
of
the
of
these
people
thou
shalt
save
alive
nothing
that
breatheth
the
reasons
for
this
wise
discrimination
were
no
doubt
cities
then
as
now
were
of
vice
they
reeked
with
abominations
little
practiced
in
the
country
on
this
account
their
influence
would
be
far
more
perilous
to
the
israelites
than
that
of
the
country
these
cities
were
the
centres
of
idolatry
the
residences
of
the
priests
with
their
retinues
of
the
baser
sort
there
were
their
temples
and
altars
and
idols
without
number
even
their
buildings
streets
and
public
walks
were
so
many
visibilities
of
idolatry
the
reason
assigned
in
the
verse
for
exterminating
them
strengthens
the
idea
they
teach
you
not
to
do
after
all
the
abominations
which
they
have
done
unto
their
this
would
be
a
reason
for
exterminating
the
nations
and
individuals
them
as
all
were
idolaters
but
god
permitted
and
even
commanded
them
in
certain
cases
to
spare
the
inhabitants
contact
with
of
them
would
be
perilous
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
peculiarly
and
of
the
cities
preeminently
so
it
will
be
seen
from
the
and
verses
that
those
cities
which
accepted
the
offer
of
peace
were
to
be
spared
thou
comest
nigh
unto
a
city
to
fight
against
it
then
proclaim
peace
unto
it
and
it
shall
be
if
it
make
thee
answer
of
peace
and
open
unto
thee
then
it
shall
be
that
all
the
people
that
is
found
therein
shall
tributaries
thee
and
they
serve
thee

rule

their
lenient
treatment
in
saving
the
wives
and
little

of
those
who
fought
them
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
cities
the
verse
gives
directions
for
the
disposal
of
the
inhabitants
of
canaanitish
cities
after
they
had
taken
them
instead
of
sparing
the
women
and
children
they
were
to
save
alive
nothing
that
breathed
the
common
mistake
has
been
in
taking
it
for
granted
that
the
command
in
the
verse
thus
shalt
thou
do
unto
all
the
cities
refers
to
the
system
of
directions
commencing
with
the
verse
whereas
it
manifestly
refers
only
to
the
specified
in

verses
immediately
preceding

the

thus

a
distinction

let
us
settle
this
question
by
the
and
the
joshua

not
a
city
that
made
peace
with
the
children
of
israel

the
hivites
the
inhabitants

others
they
took
in

the
lord
to
harden
their
hearts
that
they
come
out
against
israel
in
battle
he
might
destroy
them
utterly
and
that
they
might
have
no
favor
but
that
he
might
destroy
them
as
the
lord
commanded
that

if
they
had
come
out
against
israel
in
battle
they
would
have
had
favor
shown
them
and
would
not
have
been
the
great
design
of
god
seems
to
have
been
to
the
of
the
canaanites

israelites

alternatives

a

indispensable
to

are

are
correlative

the
claim

on
the
principle
of
equivalent

the

are
secured
equally
with
those
of
the

indeed
while
the

the

it
is
to
the

its
main
design

rather
to
benefit
the

the
interests
of
the
former

in
doing
it
it
guards
from
injury
those
of
the
latter
to

it
secures

apprentice
both
a
legal
compensation
and
a
virtual
gratuity
in
addition
he
being
of
the
two
the

gainer
the
law
not

recognizes
the
of
the
apprentice
to

reward
for
his
labor

appoints
the
wages

enforces
the
payment
the
claim
covers

the
apprentice
claim
covers

of

master
neither
can
hold
the
other
as

but
each
holds
property
in

services
of
the
other
and
both
equally
is
this

subordination

both
are

whether

the

remains
the

the

is
no

of

guilt
suppose
the

should
think
himself

the

willingness
to
be

so
far
from
lessening
the
guilt
of
the

aggravates
it
if
slavery
has
so
palsied
his

that
he
looks
upon
himself
as

and
consents
to
be

his

and
confirms
the
impious
falsehood
these
very
feelings
and
convictions
of
the
slave
if
such
were
possible
increase
a
hundred
fold
the
guilt
of
the
master
and
call
upon
him
in
thunder
immediately
to
recognize
him
as
a

and
thus
break
the
sorcery
that
cheats
him
out

many
of

no

all

he
had
neither
sold
nor
killed
it
two
oxen
but
in
the
case
of
stealing
a
the
act
drew
down
the
utmost
power
of
punishment
however
often
repeated
or
aggravated
the
crime
human
penalty
could
do
no
more
the
fact
that
the
penalty
for
was
death
and
the
penalty
for
the
mere
restoration
of
double
shows
that
the
two
cases
were
adjudicated
on
totally
different
principles
the
man
stolen
might
be
past
labor
and
his
support
a
burden
yet
death
was
the
penalty
though
not
a
worth
of
was
taken
the
penalty
for
stealing
property
was
a
mere
property
penalty
however
large
the
theft
the
payment
of
double
wiped
out
the
score
it
might
have
a
greater
value
than
a
thousand
men
yet
death
was
not
the
penalty
nor
maiming
nor
branding
nor
even
but
double
of
same
why
was
not
the
rule
uniform
when
a
was
stolen
why
was
not
the
thief
required
to
restore
double
of
the
same
kind
two
men
or
if
he
had
sold
him
five
men
do
you
say
that
the
might
not
them
so
the
might
not
have
two
oxen
or
if
he
had
killed
it
five
but
if
god
permitted
men
to
hold
as
property
equally
with
the
could
get
men
with
whom
to
pay
the
penalty
as
well
as
the
oxen
further
when
was
stolen
the
legal
penalty
was
a
compensation
to
the
person
injured
but
when
a
was
stolen
no
property
compensation
was
offered
to
tender
money
as
an
equivalent
would
have
been
to
repeat
the
outrage
with
intolerable
aggravations
compute
the
value
of
a
man
in
throw
dust
into
the
scale
against
immortality
the
law
recoiled
from
such
supreme
insult
and
impiety
to
have
permitted
the
to
expiate
his
crime
by
restoring
double
would
have
been
making
the
repetition
of
crime
its
atonement
but
the
infliction
of
death
for
exacted
the
utmost
possibility
of
reparation
it
wrung
from
the
guilty
wretch
as
he
gave
up
the
ghost
a
testimony
in
blood
and
to
the
infinite
dignity
and
worth
of
man
a
proclamation
to
the
universe
voiced
in
mortal
agony
man
is
inviolable
a
confession
shrieked
in
phrenzy
at
the
grave
mouth
i
die
accursed
and
god
is
just
if
god
permitted
man
to
hold
man
as
property
why
did
he
punish
for
stealing
that
kind
of
property
infinitely
more
than
for
stealing
any
other
kind
of
property
why
did
he
punish
with
death
for
stealing
a
very
little
of
sort
of
property
and
make
a
mere
fine
the
penalty
for
stealing
a
thousand
times
as
much
of
any
other
sort
of
property
especially
if
god
did
by
his
own
act
annihilate
the
difference
between
man
and
by
putting
him
on
a
level
with
it
the
atrociousness
of
a
crime
depends
much
upon
the
nature
character
and
condition
of
the
victim
to
steal
is
a
crime
whoever
the
thief
or
whatever
the
plunder
to
steal
bread
from
a
full
man
is
theft
to
steal
from
a
starving
man
is
both
theft
and
murder
if
i
steal
my
property
the
crime
consists
not
in
altering
the
of
the
article
but
in
shifting
its
relation
from
him
to
me
but
when
i
take
my
neighbor
himself
and
first
make
him
and
then
property
the
latter
act
which
was
the
sole
crime
in
the
former
case
dwindles
to
nothing
the
sin
in
stealing
a
man
is
not
the
transfer
from
its
owner
to
another
of
that
which
is
property
but
the
turning
of
into
true
the
attributes
of
man
remain
but
the
rights
and
immunities
which
grow
out
of
them
are
attributed
it
is
the
first
law
both
of
reason
and
revelation
to
regard
things
and
beings
as
they
are
and
the
sum
of
religion
to
feel
and
act
towards
them
according
to
their
value
knowingly
to
treat
them
otherwise
is
sin
and
the
degree
of
violence
done
to
their
nature
religions
and
value
measures
its
guilt
when
things
are
sundered
which
god
has
indissolubly
joined
or
confounded
in
one
which
he
has
separated
by
infinite
extremes
when
sacred
and
eternal
distinctions
which
he
has
garnished
with
glory
are
derided
and
set
at
nought
then
if
ever
sin
reddens
to
its
scarlet
dye
the
sin
specified
in
the
passage
is
that
of
doing
violence
to
the
of
a
man
to
his
intrinsic
value
as
a
rational
being
and
blotting
out
the
exalted
distinction
stamped
upon
him
by
his
maker
in
the
verse
preceding
and
in
that
which
follows
the
same
principle
is
laid
down
verse
he
that
smiteth
his
father
or
his
mother
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
he
that
curseth
his
father
or
his
mother
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
if
a
jew
smote
his
neighbor
the
law
merely
smote
him
in
return
but
if
the
blow
was
given
to
a
it
struck
the
smiter
dead
the
parental
relation
is
the
of
human
society
god
guards
it
with
peculiar
care
to
violate
that
is
to
violate
all
whoever
trampled
on
that
showed
that
relation
had
any
sacredness
in
his
eyes
that
he
was
unfit
to
move
among
human
relations
who
had
violated
one
so
sacred
and
tender
therefore
the
mosaic
law
uplifted
his
bleeding
corpse
and
brandished
the
ghastly
terror
around
the
parental
relation
to
guard
it
from
impious
inroads
why
such
a
difference
in
penalties
for
the
same
act
answer
the
relation
violated
was
obvious
the
distinction
between
parents
and
others
manifest
dictated
by
natural
affection
a
law
of
the
constitution
the
act
was
violence
to
nature
a
suicide
on
constitutional
susceptibilities
the
parental
relation
then
as
now
was
the
focal
point
of
the
social
system
and
required
powerful
safeguards
thy
father
and
thy
stands
at
the
head
of
those
commands
which
prescribe
the
duties
of
man
to
man
and
throughout
the
bible
the
parental
state
is
god
favorite
illustration
of
his
own
relations
to
the
whole
human
family
in
this
case
death
was
to
be
inflicted
not
for
smiting
a
but
a
a
cherished
by
god
and
around
which
he
threw
up
a
bulwark
of
defence
in
the
next
verse
he
that
stealeth
a
man
the
same
principle
is
wrought
out
in
still
stronger
relief
the
crime
to
be
punished
with
death
was
not
the
taking
of
property
from
its
owner
but
the
doing
violence
to
an
nature
blotting
out
a
sacred
making
men
chattels
the
incessant
pains
taken
in
the
old
testament
to
separate
human
beings
from
brutes
and
things
shows
god
regard
for
his
own
distinction
in
the
beginning
it
was
uttered
in
heaven
and
proclaimed
to
the
universe
as
it
rose
into
being
creation
was
arrayed
at
the
instant
of
its
birth
to
do
it
homage
it
paused
in
adoration
while
god
ushered
forth
its
crowning
work
why
that
dread
pause
and
that
creating
arm
held
back
in
mid
career
and
that
high
conference
in
the
godhead
let
us
make
man
in
our
image
after
our
likeness
and
let
him
have
dominion
over
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
over
the
fowl
of
the
air
and
over
the
cattle
and
over
all
the
earth
then
while
every
living
thing
with
land
and
sea
and
firmament
and
marshalled
worlds
waited
to
swell
the
shout
of
morning
stars
then
god
created
man
in
his
own
image
in
the
image
of
god
created
he
him
this
solves
the
problem
in
the
image
of
god
created
he
him
well
might
the
sons
of
god
shout
amen
alleluia
for
thou
hast
made
him
a
little
lower
than
the
angels
and
hast
crowned
him
with
glory
and
honor
thou
madest
him
to
have
dominion
over
the
works
of
thy
hands
thou
hast
put
all
things
under
his
feet
ps
viii
the
repetition
of
this
distinction
is
frequent
and
solemn
in
i
it
is
repeated
in
various
forms
in
we
find
it
again
in
the
likeness
of
god
made
he
man
in
ix
again
after
giving
license
to
shed
the
blood
of
every
moving
thing
that
liveth
it
is
added
sheddeth
man
blood
by
man
shall
his
blood
be
shed
in
the
image
of
god
made
he
man
as
though
it
had
been
said
all
these
creatures
are
your
property
designed
for
your
use
they
have
the
likeness
of
earth
they
perish
with
the
using
and
their
spirits
go
downward
but
this
other
being
man
has
my
own
likeness
in
the
image
of
god
made
i
man
an
intelligent
moral
immortal
agent
invited
to
all
that
i
can
give
and
he
can
be
so
in
lev
xxiv
he
that
killeth
any
man
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
and
he
that
killeth
a
beast
shall
make
it
good
beast
for
beast
and
he
that
killeth
a
man
shall
be
put
to
death

in
ps

what
an
enumeration
of
particulars
each
separating
infinitely

from

and

hast
made

a
little
lower
than

off

puts
on

of
thy
slavery
breaks
the
sceptre
and
casts
him
down
those
works
yea
hast
put
all
things
under
his
slavery
puts
him
under
the
feet
of
an
owner
who
but
an
impious
scorner
dares
thus
strive
with
his
maker
and
mutilate
his
image
and
blaspheme
the
holy
one
who
saith
as
ye
did
it
unto
one
of
the
least
of
these
ye
did
it
me
in
further
presenting
this
inquiry
the
patriarchal
and
mosaic
systems
will
be
considered
together
as
each
reflects
light
upon
the
other
and
as
many
regulations
of
the
latter
are
mere
forms
of
divine
institutions
previously
existing
as
a
the
latter
alone
is
of
divine
authority
whatever
were
the
usages
of
the
patriarchs
god
has
not
made
them
our
exemplars
a
footnote
a
those
who
insist
that
the
patriarchs
held
slaves
and
sit
with
such
delight
under
their
shadow
hymning
the
praises
of
those
good
old
patriarchs
and
slaveholders
might
at
small
cost
greatly
augment
their
numbers
a
single
stanza
celebrating
patriarchal
winding
off
with
a
chorus
in
honor
of
patriarchal
would
be
a
trumpet
call
summoning
from
bush
and
brake
highway
and
hedge
and
sheltering
fence
a
brotherhood
of
kindred
affinities
each
claiming
abraham
or
noah
as
his
patron
saint
and
shouting
my
name
is
legion
what
a
myriad
choir
and
thunderous
song
before
entering
upon
an
analysis
of
the
condition
of
servants
under
these
two
states
of
society
we
will
consider
the
import
of
certain
terms
which
describe
the
mode
of
procuring
them
import
of
buy
and
bought
with
money
as
the
israelites
were
commanded
to
buy
their
servants
and
as
abraham
had
servants
bought
with
money
it
is
argued
that
servants
were
articles
of
the
sole
ground
for
this
belief
is
the
terms
themselves
how
much
might
be
saved
if
in
discussion
the
thing
to
be
proved
were
always
to
beg
the
question
in
debate
would
be
vast
economy
of
midnight
oil
and
a
great
forestaller
of
wrinkles
and
grey
hairs
instead
of
protracted
investigation
into
scripture
usage
with
painful
collating
of
passages
to
find
the
meaning
of
terms
let
every
man
interpret
the
oldest
book
in
the
world
by
the
usages
of
his
own
time
and
place
and
the
work
is
done
and
then
instead
of
one
revelation
they
might
be
multiplied
as
the
drops
of
the
morning
and
every
man
have
an
infallible
clue
to
the
mind
of
the
spirit
if
he
only
understood
the
dialect
of
his
own
neighborhood
what
a
it
would
make
of
the
bible
to
take
it
for
granted
that
the
sense
in
which
words
are
used
is
the
sense
david
says
i
prevented
the
dawning
of
the
morning
and
cried
what
stop
the
earth
in
its
revolution
two
hundred
years
ago
was
used
in
its
strict
latin
sense
to
or
it
is
always
used
in
this
sense
in
the
old
and
new
testaments
david
expression
in
the
english
of
the
nineteenth
century
would
be
before
the
dawning
of
the
morning
i
cried
in
almost
every
chapter
of
the
bible
words
are
used
in
a
sense
now
nearly
or
quite
obsolete
and
sometimes
in
a
sense
totally
to
their
present
meaning
a
few
examples

i
purposed
to
come
to
you
but
was
hindered
hitherto
and
the
four
living
ones

down
and
worshipped
god
whosoever
shall
cause
to
sin
one
of
these
little
ones
go
out
into
the
highways
and
urge
them
to
come
in
only
let
your
habitual
conduct
be
as
becometh
the
gospel
they
that
seek
me
earnestly
shall
find
me
so
when
tribulation
or
persecution
ariseth
immediately
they
are
offended
nothing
is
more
mutable
than
language
words
like
bodies
are
always
throwing
off
some
particles
and
absorbing
others
so
long
as
they
are
mere
elected
by
the
whims
of
universal
suffrage
their
meaning
will
be
a
perfect
volatile
and
to
cork
it
up
for
the
next
century
is
an
employment
sufficiently
silly
to
speak
within
bounds
for
a
modern
bible
dictionary
maker
there
never
was
a
shallower
conceit
than
that
of
establishing
the
sense
attached
to
a
word
centuries
ago
by
showing
what
it
means
pity
that
fashionable
mantuamakers
were
not
a
little
quicker
at
taking
hints
from
some
doctors
of
divinity
how
easily
they
might
save
their
pious
customers
all
qualms
of
conscience
about
the
weekly
shiftings
of
fashion
by
proving
that
the
last
importation
of
parisian
indecency
now
flaunting
on
promenade
was
the
very
style
of
dress
in
which
the
pious
sarah
kneaded
cakes
for
the
angels
and
the
modest
rebecca
drew
water
for
the
camels
of
servants
since
such
fashions
are
rife
in
broadway
they
have
been
in
canaan
and
padanaram
four
thousand
years
ago
the
inference
that
the
word
buy
used
to
describe
the
procuring
of
servants
means
procuring
them
as
seems
based
upon
the
fallacy
that
whatever
money
money
that
whatever
or
whoever
you
pay
money
is
an
article
of
property
and
the
fact
of
your
paying
for
it
it
property

this

held

was

said
behold

have
this

it
is

that
neither

regarded

as
articles
of
property

merely
as
bound
to
labor

certain
conditions

idea
attached

voluntarily
offered

secured

for

not
at
all
that
the
egyptians
were
bereft
of
their
personal
ownership
and
made
articles
of
property
and
this
buying
of
in
this
case
it
was
but

is
called

this

accord
obtaining
permanently
the
of
persons
or
even
a
portion
of

is
called
buying
those
persons
the
objector
at
the
outset
takes
it
for
granted
that
servants
were
bought
of
persons
and
thence
infers
that
they
were
articles
of
property
both
the
alleged
fact
and
the
inference
are
sheer
no
instance
is
recorded
under
the
mosaic
system
in
which
a

servants
who
were

is
a
fair
inference
from
various
passages
of
scripture
in
leviticus

the
case
of
the
israelite
who
became
the
servant
of
the
stranger
the
words

he

himself

buy
you
how
could
they
without
our
translation
makes
it
nonsense
the
word
rendered
be
sold
is
used
here
in
the
hithpael
conjugation
which
is
generally
reflexive
in
its
force
and
like
the
middle

represents
what
an

it
is
strange
that
no

on

the
leading
design
of
the

the
rights

privileges
secured
to
them
the
general
object
of
the

the
good
of

especially
the
good

the
poorer
classes

of

lightening

no

this
shows
that
the
system
was
framed
to
advance
the
interests
and
gratify
the
wishes
of
the
servant
quite
as
much
as
those

the
ancient
jewish
doctors
assert
that
the

from
the
strangers
who
at

close
of

probationary
year
refused
to
adopt
the
jewish
religion
and
was
on
that
account
sent
back
to
his

received
a

his
services
besides
the
payment
of
his
expenses
but
that
of
the
circumcision
of
the
foreign
servant
for
a
year
even
at
after
he
had
entered
the
family
of
an
israelite
of
which
the
mishnic
doctors
speak
seems
to
have
been
mere
we
find
nothing
of
it
in
the
regulations
of
the
mosaic
system
circumcision
was
manifestly
a
rite
strictly
whether
it
was
a
rite
merely
or
or
comes
not
within
the

of
this
ii
we
argue
the
voluntariness
of
servants
from
deut
xxiii
thou
shalt
not
deliver
unto
his
master
the
servant
which
is
escaped
from
his
master
unto
thee
he
shall
dwell
with
thee
even
among
you
in
that
place
which
he
shall
choose
in
one
of
thy
gates
where
it
liketh
him
best
thou
shalt
not
oppress
him
as
though
god
had
said
to
deliver
him
up
would
be
to
recognize
the
of
the
master
to
hold
him
his
shows
his
proclaims
his
wrongs
and
his
title
to
protection
you
shall
not
force
him
back
and
thus
recognize
the
of
the
master
to
hold
him
in
such
a
condition
as
induces
him
to
flee
to
others
for
protection
it
may
be
said
that
this
command
referred
only
to
the
servants
of
masters
in
the
surrounding
nations
we
answer
the
terms
of
the
command
are
unlimited
but
the
objection
if
valid
would
merely
shift
the
pressure
of
the
difficulty
to
another
point
did
god
require
them
to
protect
the
of
a
servant
from
the
heathen
and
yet
the
same
persons
to
crush
the
free
choice
of
of
servants
from
the
heathen
suppose
a
case
a
servant
flees
to
the
israelites
god
says
he
shall
dwell
with
thee
in
that
place
which
shall
in
one
of
thy
gates
where
it
best
now
suppose
this
same
servant
instead
of
coming
into
israel
of
his
own
accord
had
been
in
by
some
kidnapper
who
him
of
his
master
and
him
into
a
condition
against
his
will
would
he
who
forbade
such
treatment
of
the
stranger
who
came
into
the
land
sanction
the
treatment
of
the
provided
in
to
this
last
outrage
the
one
had
been
committed
of
forcing
him
into
the
nation
against
his
will
to
commit
violence
on
the
free
choice
of
a
servant
is
forsooth
a
horrible
enormity
provided
you
the
violence
he
has
come
among
you
but
if
you
commit
the
on
the
side
of
the
if
you
begin
the
outrage
by
buying
him
from
a
third
person
against
his
will
and
then
tear
him
from
home
drag
him
across
the
line
into
the
land
of
israel
and
hold
him
as
a
slave
ah
that
alters
the
case
and
you
may
perpetrate
the
violence
now
with
impunity
would
favor
have
been
shown
to
this
new
comer
than
to
the
old
residents
those
who
had
been
servants
in
jewish
families
perhaps
for
a
generation
were
the
israelites
commanded
to
exercise
toward
uncircumcised
and
out
of
the
covenant
a
justice
and
kindness
denied
to
the
multitudes
who
circumcised
and
the
covenant
but
the
objector
finds
small
gain
to
his
argument
on
the
supposition
that
the
covenant
respected
merely
the
fugitives
from
the
surrounding
nations
while
it
left
the
servants
of
the
israelites
in
a
condition
against
their
wills
in
that
case
the
surrounding
nations
would
adopt
retaliatory
measures
and
become
so
many
asylums
for
jewish
fugitives
as
these
nations
were
not
only
on
every
side
of
them
but
in
their
midst
such
a
proclamation
would
have
been
an
effectual
lure
to
men
whose
condition
was
a
constant
counteraction
of
will
besides
the
same
command
which
protected
the
servant
from
the
power
of
his
foreign
protected
him
equally
from
the
power
of
an
it
was
not
thou
shalt
not
deliver
him
unto
his
but
he
shall
dwell
with
thee
in
that
place
which
shall
in
one
of
thy
gates
where
it
liketh
best
every
israelite
was
forbidden
to
put
him
in
any
condition

was
this
but
a
proclamation
that
all
who
to
live
in
the
land
and
obey
the
laws
were
left
to
their
own
free
will
to
dispose
of
their
services
at
such
a
rate
to
such
persons
and
in
such
places
as
they
pleased
besides
grant
that
this
command
prohibited
the
sending
back
of
servants
merely
there
was
no
law
requiring
the
return
of
servants
who
had
escaped
from
the
lost
and
escaped
they
were
required
to
return
but
not
escaped
servants
these
verses
contain
a
command
thou
shall
not
deliver
a
declaration
of
the
fugitive
right
of
and
of
god
will
that
he
should
exercise
it
at
his
own
discretion
and
a
command
guarding
this
right
namely
thou
shalt
not
oppress
him
as
though
god
had
said
if
you
restrain
him
from
exercising
his
as
to
the
place
and
condition
of
his
residence
it
is
iii
we
argue
the
voluntariness
of
servants
from
their
peculiar
opportunities
and
facilities
for
escape
three
times
every
year
all
the
males
over
twelve
years
were
required
to
attend
the
national
feasts
they
were
thus
absent
from
their
homes
not
less
than
three
weeks
at
each
time
making
nine
weeks
annually
as
these
caravans
moved
over
the
country
were
there
military
scouts
lining
the
way
to
intercept
deserters
a
corporal
guard
at
each
pass
of
the
mountains
sentinels
pacing
the
and
light
horse
scouring
the
defiles
the
israelites
must
have
had
some
safe
contrivance
for
taking
their
three
times
in
a
year
to
jerusalem
and
back
when
a
body
of
slaves
is
moved
any
distance
in
our
they
are
and
chained
together
to
keep
them
from
running
away
or
beating
their
drivers
brains
out
was
this
the
plan
or
an
improvement
introduced
by
samuel
or
was
it
left
for
the
wisdom
of
solomon
the
usage
doubtless
claims
a
paternity
not
less
venerable
and
biblical
perhaps
they
were
lashed
upon
camels
and
transported
in
bundles
or
caged
up
and
trundled
on
wheels
to
and
fro
and
while
at
the
holy
city
lodged
in
jail
for
safe
keeping
the
sanhedrim
appointing
special
religious
services
for
their
benefit
and
their
drivers
officiating
at
oral
instruction
mean
while
what
became
of
the
sturdy
left
at
home
what
hindered
them
from
marching
off
in
a
body
perhaps
the
israelitish
matrons
stood
sentry
in
rotation
round
the
kitchens
while
the
young
ladies
scoured
the
country
as
mounted
rangers
picking
up
stragglers
by
day
and
patrolled
the
streets
keeping
a
sharp
at
night
iv
their
continuance
in
jewish
families
depended
upon
the
performance
of
various
rites
necessarily
voluntary
suppose
the
servants
from
the
heathen
had
upon
entering
jewish
families
refused
circumcision
if
how
simple
the
process
of
emancipation
their
did
the
job
or
suppose
they
had
refused
to
attend
the
annual
feasts
or
had
eaten
unleavened
bread
during
the
passover
or
compounded
the
ingredients
of
the
anointing
oil
they
would
have
been
cut
off
from
the
people
we
infer
the
voluntariness
of
the
servants
of
the
patriarchs
from
the
impossibility
of
their
having
been
held
against
their
wills
servants
are
an
illustration
at
one
time
he
had
three
hundred
and
eighteen
born
in
his
house
and
many
more
born
in
his
house
his
servants
of
all
ages
were
probably
many
thousands
how
abraham
and
sarah
contrived
to
hold
fast
so
many
thousand
servants
against
their
wills
we
are
left
quite
in
the
dark
the
most
natural
supposition
is
that
the
patriarch
and
his
wife
in
surrounding
them
the
neighboring
tribes
instead
of
constituting
a
picket
guard
to
hem
in
his
servants
would
have
been
far
more
likely
to
sweep
them
and
him
into
captivity
as
they
did
lot
and
his
household
besides
there
was
neither
constitution
nor
compact
to
send
back
abraham
fugitives
nor
a
truckling
police
to
pounce
upon
them
nor
suing
for
his
patronage
volunteering
to
howl
on
their
track
boasting
their
scent
and
pledging
their
honor
to
hunt
down
and
deliver
up
they
had
a
description
of
the
and
were
suitably
stimulated
by
of
abraham
seems
also
to
have
been
sadly
deficient
in
all
the
auxiliaries
of
family
government
such
as
stocks
yokes
gags
and
his
destitution
of
these
patriarchal
indispensables
is
the
more
afflicting
since
he
faithfully
trained
his
household
to
do
justice
and
judgment
though
so
deplorably
destitute
of
the
needful
aids
vi
we
infer
that
servants
were
voluntary
as
there
is
no
instance
of
an
israelitish
master
selling
a
servant
abraham
had
thousands
of
servants
but
seems
never
to
have
sold

sell
if
they
had
no
property
until
their
services
had
made
good
the
injury
and
paid
the
legal
fine
ex

but
seem
to
have
had
no
power
to
sell
their
to
give
the
master
a
to
sell
his
servant
would
annihilate
the
servant
right
of
choice
in
his
own
disposal
but
says
the
objector
to
give
the
master
a
right
to
a
servant
equally
annihilates
the
servant

answer
it
is
one
thing
to
have
a
right
to
buy
a
man
and
a
different
thing

have
a
right
to
buy

there
is
no

they

who
laid

vii
we
infer
that
the
hebrew
servant
was
voluntary
in
commencing
his
service
because
he
was
so
in
continuing
it
if
at
the
year
of

with
his

method
prescribed
for
procuring
servants

appeal

offer
them

suitable
inducement
and
then
leave
them
to
decide
they
might
neither
seize
them
by
nor
frighten
them
by
nor
wheedle
them
by
false
pretences
nor
them
nor
them

they
were
commanded
to
buy
them
a
that
is
they
were
to
recognize
the
of
the
individuals
to
of
their
own
services
and
their
right
to
all

thus
oblige
those
who
made
them

their
own

persons

the
extent
of
his
possessions
can
be
inferred
from
the
fact
that
though
the
father
of
fifteen
sons
he
had
twenty
servants
in
lev

where
a
servant
reduced
to
poverty
sold
himself
it
is
declared
that
he
may
be
either
by
his
kindred
or
by
himself
having
been
forced
to
sell
himself
from
poverty
he
must
have
acquired
considerable
property
he
became
a
servant
if
it
had
not
been
common
for
servants
to
acquire
property
over
which
they
had
the
control
the
servant
of
elisha
would
hardly
have
ventured
to
take
a
large
sum
of
money
nearly
a
from
naaman
kings
as
it
was
procured
by
deceit
he
wished
to
conceal
the
means
used
in
getting
it
but
if
servants
could
own
nothing
nor
acquire
any
thing
to
embark
in
such
an
enterprise
would
have
been
consummate
stupidity
the
fact
of
having
in
his
possession
two
talents
of
silver
would
of
itself
convict
him
of
theft
b
but
since
it
was
common
for
servants
to
own
property
he
might
have
it
and
invest
or
use
it
without
attracting
special
attention
and
that
consideration
alone
would
have
been
a
strong
motive
to
the
act
his
master
while
rebuking
him
for
using
such
means
to
get
the
money
not
only
does
not
take
it
from
him

seems
to
expect
that
he
would
invest
it
in
real

of

kinds
and
a
law
requiring
an
abundant
provision
for
the
wants
of
an
animal
ministering
to
man
in
a
way
a
general
principle
of
treatment
covering
all
times
modes
and
instrumentalities
of
service
the
object
of
the
law
was
not
merely
to
enjoin
tenderness
towards
brutes
but
to
inculcate
the
duty
of
rewarding
those
who
serve
us
and
if
such
care
be
enjoined
by
god
both
for
the
ample
sustenance
and
present
enjoyment

would
be
a

for
the
services
of

his

nature

expressly

this
principle
lies

statute

now
we
ask
by
what
process
of
legerdemain
this
regulation
can
be
made

harmonize
with
the
doctrine

did
god
declare
the
poor

in
the

authorize

discussion

additional
considerations

suffice
it
to

regarded
as

though
of

indeed

example
of
this
good
old
patriarch
and
slaveholder
saint
laban
would
have
been
a
forecloser
to
all
argument
ah
we
remember
his
jealousy
for
his
holy
indignation
when
he
found
that
his
gods
were
stolen
how
he
mustered
his
clan
and
plunged
over
the
desert
in
hot
pursuit
seven
days
by
forced
marches
how
he
ransacked
a
whole
caravan
sifting
the
contents
of
every

little
heeding
such
small
matters
as
domestic
privacy
or
female
seclusion
for
lo
the
zeal
of
his

had
eaten
him
up
no
wonder
that
slavery
in
its

dismantled

scud

of
such
a
pious
worthy
to
haul
up

refit
invoking
his

and
the

of

again
it
may
be

that

for

it

to

what
was
the

gibeonites
under

israelites
was
their
own
proposition
to
joshua
was
to
become
servants
josh

it
was
accepted
but
the
kind
of
service
which
they
should
perform
was
not
specified
until
their
gross
imposition
came
to
light
they
were
then
assigned
to
menial
offices
in
the
tabernacle
were
not
domestic
servants
in
the
families
of
the
they
still
resided
in
their
own
cities
cultivated
their
own
fields
tended
their
flocks
and
herds
and
exercised
the
functions
of
a
though
not
independent
community
they
were
subject
to
the
jewish
nation
as
so
far
from
being
distributed
among
the
israelites
and
their
internal
organization
as
a
distinct
people
abolished
they
remained
a
separate
and
in
some
respects
an
independent
community
for
many
centuries
when
attacked
by
the
amorites
they
applied
to
the
israelites
as
confederates
for
aid
it
was
rendered
their
enemies
routed

themselves
left
unmolested
in

cities

what
shall

you

wherewith

i
make
the
atonement
at
their
demand
he
delivered
up
to
them
seven
of
descendants
sam

the
whole
transaction
was
a
formal
recognition
of
the
gibeonites
as
a
distinct
people
there
is
no
intimation
that
they
served
families
or
individuals
of
the
israelites
but
only
the
house
of
god
or
the
tabernacle
this
was
established
first
at

a

journey
from
their
cities
and
then
at
shiloh
nearly
two
day
journey
from
them
where
it
continued
about
years
during
this
period
the
gibeonites
inhabited
their
ancient
cities

a
few
comparatively
could
have
been

any
one
time

attendance
on
the

wherever
allusion
is
made
to
them
in

history
the
main

are
spoken
of
as
it
is
preposterous
to
suppose
that
all
the
inhabitants
of
these
four
cities
could
find
employment
at
the
tabernacle
one
of
them
was
a
great
city
as
one
of
the
royal
cities
so
large
that
a
confederacy
of
five
kings
apparently
the
most
powerful
in
the
land
was
deemed
necessary
for
its
destruction
it
is
probable
that
the
men
were
divided
into
classes
ministering
in
rotation
each
class
a
few
days
or
weeks
at
a
time
this
service
was
their
to
the
israelites
for
the
privilege
of
residence
and
protection
under
their
government
no
service
seems
to
have
been
required
of
the
as
these
gibeonites
were
canaanites
and
as
they
had
greatly
exasperated
the
israelites
by
impudent
imposition
and
lying
we
might
assuredly
expect
that
they
would
reduce
to
the
condition
of
chattels
if
there
was
case
in
which
god
permitted
them
to
do
so

taking

this

the
of
slaveholders
and
they
never
venture
abroad
without
it
it
is
a
for
sudden
occasion

dote
over

those
who
justify
negro

by
the
curse
of

all
the
points
in
debate
that
was
prophesied
rather
than
mere
to
others
and
bondage
rather
than
subjection
and
tribute
that
the
of
crime

at
least
absolving
those
whose
crimes
fulfill
it
if
not
transforming
the
crimes
into
how
piously
the
pharoahs
might
have
quoted
the
prophecy
thy
seed
shall
be
a
stranger
in
a
land
that
is
not
theirs
and
they
shall
afflict
there
four
hundred
years
and
then
what
were
those
that
crucified
the
lord
of
glory
that
the
africans
are
descended
from
canaan
whereas
africa
was
peopled
from
egypt
and
ethiopia
and
they
were
settled
by
mizraim
and
cush
for
the
location
and
boundaries
of
canaan
posterity
see
x
so
a
prophecy
of
evil
to
one
people
is
quoted
to
justify
its
infliction
upon
another
perhaps
it
may
be
argued
that
canaan
includes
all
posterity
if
so
the
prophecy
is
yet
unfulfilled
the
other
sons
of
ham
settled
egypt
and
assyria
and
conjointly
with
shem
persia
and
afterward
to
some
extent
the
grecian
and
roman
empires
the
history
of
these
nations
gives
no
verification
of
the
prophecy
whereas
the
history
of
canaan
descendants
for
more
than
three
thousand
years
records
its
fulfilment
first
they
were
put
to
tribute
by
the
israelites
then
by
the
medes
and
persians
then
by
the
macedonians
grecians
and
romans
successively
and
finally
were
subjected
by
the
ottoman
dynasty
where
they
yet
remain
thus
canaan
has
been
for
ages
the
servant
mainly
of
shem
and
japhet
and
secondarily
of
the
other
sons
of
ham
it
may
still
be
objected
that
though
canaan
alone
is
in
the
curse
yet
the
and
verses
show
the
posterity
of
ham
in
general
to
be
meant
and
ham
the
father
of
canaan
saw
the
nakedness
of
his
father
and
told
his
two
brethren
without
and
noah
awoke
from
his
wine
and
knew
what
his
younger
son
had
done
unto
him
and
said
it
is
argued
that
this
son
can
not
be
as
he
was
the
of
noah

therefore
it
must
be

even

made

showing
that
the

further
the
word
here
rendered
is
so
rendered
in
another
yet
it
occurs
times
in
the
old
testament
and
in
almost
every
place
is
translated
in
a
few
take
or
and
in
this
instance
alone
as
it
stands
in
our
translation
the
pronoun
preceding
it
refers
to
the
whereas
it
should
refer
to
the

the
word

the

this

with

under

shall
be
that

the

be
by
the
of

so
in

his
death
is
not
to
be
avenged
by
the
of

in
that
case
the
crime
was
to
be
adjudged
and
not
in

verse
another
case
of
personal
injury
is
stated
for
which
the
injurer
is
to
pay
a

yet
our
translators
employ
the
same
phraseology
in
both
places
one
an
instance
of
deliberate
wanton
killing
by
piecemeal
the
other
an
accidental
and
comparatively
slight
injury
of
the
inflicter
in
both
cases
they
say
the
same
thing
he
shall
surely
be
punished
now
just
the
discrimination
to
be
looked
for
where
god
legislates
is
marked
in
the
original
in
the
case
of
the
servant
wilfully
murdered
he
says
it
the
death
shall
surely
be
that
is
the
life
of
the
wrong
doer
shall
expiate
the
crime

word

testament

the
greatest
wrongs
are
redressed

devoting
the
perpetrators
to

the
case
of
the
unintentional
injury
in
the
following
verse
god
says
he
shall
surely
be
he
shall
as
the
judges
determine
the
simple
meaning
of
the
word
is
to
lay
a
fine
it
is
used
in
deut

they
shall
amerce
him
in
one
hundred

and
in
chron

he
condemned
the

in
a

of
gold
that
the
death
of
the
servant
was
neither
imprisonment
nor
stripes
nor
a
fine
but
that
it
was
the
master

the
clause
for

to
prove
that
the

is
his

property

therefore
if

the

the
objector
admits
that
in
the
case
the
master
is
to
be
surely
punished
for
destroying
own
property
the
other
inference
is
that
since
the
continuance
of
a
day
or
two
cleared
the
master
of
to
the
loss
of
the
slave
would
be
a
sufficient
punishment

inflicting

injury

caused
his

we
will
now
ascertain
what
sanction
to

is
derivable
from
the
terms

the
fact
that
servants
from
the
heathen
are

while
others
are

is
quoted
as
proof
that
the
former
were
slaves

the

were
not
inspired
we
need
stand
in
no
special
awe
of

the

had

we
should
have
some

but
our
dictionaries
give
us
none
why
because
there
is
no
such
but
the
objector
asks
would
not
the
israelites
use
their
word
if
they
spoke
of
the
slave
of
a
heathen
answer
their
servants
or
tributaries
are
spoken
of
frequently
but
domestic
servants
so
rarely
that
no
necessity
existed
even
if
they
were
slaves
for
coining
a
new
word
besides
the
fact
of
their
being
domestics
under
laws
and
proclaimed
their
their
made
a
term
unnecessary
but
if
the
israelites
had
not
only
but
a
multitude
of
a
meaning
would
have
been
indispensable
for
every
day
convenience
further
the
laws
of
the
mosaic
system
were
so
many
sentinels
on
the
outposts
to
warn
off
foreign
practices
the
border
ground
of
canaan
was
quarantine
ground
enforcing
the
strictest
in
usages
between
the
without
and
the
within
forever
this
is
quoted
to
prove
that
servants
were
to
serve
during
their
life
time
and
their
posterity
from
generation
to
generation
no
such
idea
is
contained
in
the
passage
the
word
forever
instead
of
defining
the
length
of
service
proclaims
the
permanence
of
the
regulation
laid
down
in
the
two
verses
preceding
namely
that
their
should
be
of
the
strangers
and
not
of
the
israelites
it
declares
the
duration
of
that
general
provision
as
if
god
had
said
you
shall
get
your
laborers
from
the
nations
round
about
you
your
servants
shall
always
be
of
that
class
of
persons
as
it
stands
in
the
original
it
is
plain
forever
of
them
shall
ye
serve
yourselves
this
is
the
literal
rendering
that
refers
to
the
permanent
relations
of
a
rather
than
to
the
services
of

a
fair
inference
from
the
form
of
the
expression
both
thy
bondmen
shall
be
of
the
of
them
shall
ye
buy
they
shall
be
your
possession
to
say
nothing
of
the
uncertainty
of
surviving
those
whom
they
are
to
live
the
language
used
applies
more
naturally
to
a
of
people
than
to
servants
besides
service
can
not
be
argued
from
the
term
the
ninth
and
tenth
verses
of
the
same
chapter
limit
it
absolutely
by
the
jubilee
then
thou
shalt
cause
the
trumpet
of
the
jubilee
to
sound
throughout
all
your
land
and
ye
shall
proclaim
liberty
throughout
all
the
land
unto
all
the
inhabitants
thereof
it
may
be
objected
that
inhabitants
here
means
inhabitants
alone
the
command
is
proclaim
liberty
throughout
all
the
land
unto
all
inhabitants
besides
in
the
sixth
verse
there
is
an
enumeration
of
the
different
classes
of
the
inhabitants
in
which
servants
and
strangers
are
included
and
in
all
the
regulations
of
the
jubilee
and
the
sabbatical
year
the
strangers
are
included
in
the
precepts
prohibitions
and
promises
again
the
year
of
jubilee
was
ushered
in
by
the
day
of
atonement
what
did
these
institutions
show
forth
the
day
of
atonement
prefigured
the
atonement
of
christ
and
the
year
of

the
gospel
jubilee
and
did
they
prefigure
an
atonement
and
a
jubilee
to
jews
only
were
they
types
of
sins
remitted
and
of
salvation
proclaimed
to
the
nation
of
israel
alone
is
there
no
redemption
for
us
gentiles
in
these
ends
of
the
earth
and
is
our
hope
presumption
and
impiety
did
that
old
partition
wall
survive
the
shock
that
made
earth
quake
and
hid
the
sun
burst
graves
and
rocks
and
rent
the
temple
veil
and
did
the
gospel
only
rear
it
higher
to

from
its
frowning
battlements

of
great
joy

be

from
all
the
ransomed
thou
hast
redeemed
us
unto
god
by
thy
blood
out
of
every
kindred
and
tongue
and
people
and
nation
to
deny
that
the
blessings
of
the
jubilee
extended
to
the
servants
from
the
makes
christianity
it
not
only
eclipses
the
glory
of
the
gospel
but
strikes
out
the
sun
the
refusal
to
release
servants
at
the
jubilee
falsified
and
disannulled
a
grand
leading
type
of
the
atonement
and
was
a
libel
on
the
doctrine
of
redemption
finally
even
if
did
refer
to
service
we
have
ample
precedents
for
limiting
the
term
by
the
jubilee
the
same
word
defines
the
length
of
time
which
servants
served
who
did
not
go
out
in
the
year
and
all
admit
that
they
went
out
at
the
jubilee
ex

the
verse
of
the
same
chapter
is
quoted
to
prove
that
in
the
verse
extends
beyond
the
jubilee
the
land
shall
not
be
sold
forever
for
the
land
is
mine
since
it
would
hardly
be
used
in
different
senses
in
the
same
general
connection
as
in
the
verse
respects
the
and
not
the
objection
does
not
touch
the
argument
besides
in
the
verse
the
word
used
is
meaning
the
whatever
that
may
be
whereas
in
the
verse
it
is
meaning
a
inheritance
and
possession
ye
shall
take
them
as
an
inheritance
for
your
children
after
you
to
inherit
them
for
a
possession
this
refers
to
the
and
not
to
the
servants
procured
from
these
nations
we
have
already
shown
that
servants
could
not
be
held
as
a
and
inheritance
that
they
became
servants
of
their
and
were
paid
wages
that
they
were
released
by
law
from
their
regular
labor
nearly
the
days
in
each
and
thoroughly
that
the
servants
were
in
all
their
personal
social
and
religious
rights
equally
with
their
masters
all
remaining
after
these
ample
reservations
would
be
small
temptation
either
to
the
lust
of
power
or
of
lucre
a
profitable
possession
and
inheritance
truly
what
if
our

soft

the
question

in

in
what
sense
were
the
israelites
to
these
nations
and
as
an
for
their
answer
they
possessed
them
as
a
permanent
source
of
supply
for
domestic
or
household
servants
and
this
relation
to
these
nations
was
to
go
down
to
posterity
as
a
standing
regulation
having
the
certainty
and
regularity
of
a
descent
by

the
sense
of
the
whole
regulation
may
be
given

the
design
of
the
passage
is
manifest
from
its
structure
it
was
to
point
out
the
of
persons
from
which
they
were

as
only
class
is
called
it
is
inferred
that
servants
of
the
class
were
for
their
labor
that
god
with
thundering
anathemas
against
those
who
used
their
neighbor
service
without
wages
granted
a
special
indulgence
to
his
chosen
people
to
force
others
to
work
and
rob
them
of
earnings
provided
always
in
selecting
their
victims
they
spared
the
gentlemen
of
property
and
standing
and
pounced
only
upon
the
strangers
and
the
common
people
the
inference
that
is
synonymous
with
and
that
those
servants
not
hired
were
not
for
their
labor
is
a
mere
assumption
the
meaning
of
the
english
verb
is
to
procure
for
a
use
at
a
certain
price
to
engage
a
person
to
temporary
service
for
wages
that
is
also
the
meaning
of
the
hebrew
word
it
is
not
used
when
the
procurement
of
service
is
spoken
of
now
we
ask
would
servants
those
who
constituted
a
stationary
part
of
the
family
have
been
designated
by
the
same
term
that
marks
servants
the
distinction
on
this
subject
are
familiar
as
in
many
families
the
domestics
perform
only
the
work
whatever
is
occasional
merely
as
the
washing
of
a
family
is
done
by
persons
hired
expressly
for
the
purpose
the
familiar
distinction
between
the
two
classes
is
servants
and
hired
help
not
help
classes
are
one
is
permanent
the
other
occasional
and
temporary
and
therefore
in
this
case
called
a
footnote
a
to
suppose
a
servant
robbed
of
his
earnings
because
he
is
not
called
a
servant
is
profound
induction
if
i
employ
a
man
at
twelve
dollars
a
month
to
work
my
farm
he
is
my
man
but
if
give
him
such
a
portion
of
the
or
in
other
words
if
he
works
my
farm
every
farmer
knows
that
he
is
no
longer
called
my
man
yet
he
works
the
same
farm
in
the
same
way
at
the
same
time
and
with
the
same
teams
and
tools
and
does
the
same
amount
of
work
in
the
year
and
perhaps
earns
twenty
dollars
a
month
instead
of
twelve
now
as
he
is
no
longer
called
and
as
he
still
works
my
farm
suppose
my
neighbours
sagely
infer
that
since
he
is
not
my
laborer
i
him
of
his
earnings
and
with
all
the
gravity
of
owls
pronounce
the
oracular
decision
and
hoot

the
inferior
condition
of

may
humility
sinks
of
its
own
weight
and
in
the
lowest
deep

the
design
of
the
parable
was
to
illustrate
on
the

hand
the
joy
of
god
as
he
beholds
afar
off
the
returning
sinner
seeking
an
injured
father

who
runs
to
clasp
and
bless
him

on

the
supposition
that
servants
were
the
class
takes
from
the
parable
an
element
of
winning
beauty
and
pathos
it
is
manifest
to
every
careful
student
of
the
bible
that
class
of
servants
was
on
terms
of
equality
with
the
children
and
other
members
of
the
family

the
force

declaration

unto
you
that
the
heir
so

as
he

differeth
nothing
from

though
he
be
lord
of
all
if
this
were
the
class
the
prodigal
was
a
sorry
specimen
of
humility
would
our
lord
have
put
such
language
upon
the
lips
of
one
held
up
by
himself
as
a
model
of
gospel
humility
to
illustrate
its
deep
sense
of
an

this

it
on
stilts

set
it

strutting

pride

lessons

blunders

israelites
and
strangers
belonged
indiscriminately
to
class
of
the
servants
the
and
the
that
those
in
the
former
class
whether
jews
or
strangers
rose
to
honors
and
authority
in
the
family
circle
which
were
not
conferred
on
servants
has
been
shown
it
should
be
added
however
that
in
the
enjoyment
of
privileges
merely
the
hired
servants
from
the
were
more
favored
than
even
the
bought
servants
from
the
no
one
from
the
strangers
however
wealthy
or
highly
endowed
was
eligible
to
the
highest
office
nor
could
he
own
the
soil
this
last
disability
seems
to
have
been
one
reason
for
the
different
periods
of
service
required
of
the
two
classes
of
bought
servants
the
israelites
and
the
strangers
the
israelite
was
to
serve
six
years
the
stranger
until
the
jubilee
as
the
strangers
could
not
own
the
soil
nor
even
houses
except
within
walled
towns
most
would
attach
themselves
to
israelitish
families
those
who
were
wealthy
or
skilled
in
manufactures
instead
of
becoming
servants
would
need
servants
for
their
own
use
and
as
inducements
for
the
stranger
to
become
servants
to
the
israelites
were
greater
than
persons
of
their
own
nation
could
hold
out
to
them
these
wealthy
strangers
would
naturally
procure
the
poorer
israelites
for
servants
lev
xxv
in
a
word
such
was
the
political
condition
of
the
strangers
that
the
jewish
polity
offered
a
virtual
bounty
to
such
as
would
become
permanent
servants
and
thus
secure
those
privileges
already
enumerated
and
for
their
children
in
the
second
generation

permanent
inheritance

the

israelites

all
the
soil
and
an
inheritance
of
land
being
a
sacred
possession
to
hold
it
free
of
incumbrance
was
with
every
israelite
a
delicate
point
both
of
family
honor
and
personal
character
kings
xxi
hence
to
forego
the
control
of
inheritance
after
the
division
of
the
paternal
domain
or
to
be
kept
out
of
it
after
having
acceded
to
it
was
a
burden
grievous
to
be
borne
to
mitigate
as
much
as
possible
such
a
calamity
the
law
released
the
israelitish
servant
at
the
end
of
six
years
a
as
during
that
time
if
of
the
first
class
the
partition
of
the
patrimonial
land
might
have
taken
place
or
if
of
the
second
enough
money
might
have
been
earned
to
disencumber
his
estate
and
thus
he
might
assume
his
station
as
a
lord
of
the
soil
if
neither
contingency
had
occurred
then
after
another
six
years
the
opportunity
was
again
offered
and
so
on
until
the
jubilee
so
while
strong
motives
urged
the
israelite
to
discontinue
his
service
as
soon
as
the
exigency
had
passed
which
made
him
a
servant
every
consideration
impelled
the
to
his
term
of
service

the
same
kindness
which
dictated
the
law
of
six
service
for
the
israelite
assigned
as
a
general
rule
a
much
longer
period
to
the
gentile
servant
who
had
every
inducement
to
protract
the
term
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
adult
jews
ordinarily
became
servants
only
as
a
temporary
expedient
to
relieve
themselves
from
embarrassment
and
ceased
to
be
such
when
that
object
was
effected
the
poverty
that
forced
them
to
it
was
a
calamity
and
their
service
was
either
a
means
of
relief
or
a
measure
of
prevention
not
pursued
as
a
permanent
business
but
resorted
to
on
emergencies
a
sort
of
episode
in
the
main
scope
of
their
lives
whereas
with
the
strangers
it
was
a
pursued
both
as
a
of
bettering
their
own
condition
and
that
of
their
posterity
and
as
an
for
its
own
sake
conferring
on
them
privileges
and
a
social
estimation
not
otherwise
attainable
footnote
a
another
reason
for
protracting
the
service
until
the
seventh
year
seems
to
have
been
the
coincidence
of
that
period
with
other
arrangements
in
the
jewish
economy
its
pecuniary
responsibilities
social
relations
and
general
internal
structure
were
upon
a
septennial
scale
besides
as
those
israelites
who
became
servants
through
poverty
would
not
sell
themselves
till
other
expedients
to
recruit
their
finances

failed

a
state

we
see
from
the
foregoing
why
servants
purchased
from
the
heathen
are
called
by
way
of
distinction

they
followed
it
as
a
their

that
of
the
other
class

a
class
they
doubtless
greatly
outnumbered
the
israelitish

the

distinction
between

almost
exclusively
besides

hence
the
only
form

that

was

acceded

off
from
it

incumbrance

inheritance

consideration

to
be
indebted
to
a
neighbor
for
shelter
sustenance
and
employment

sad
a
reverse
might
well
claim
sympathy

one
consolation

to
its
head

the
general
consideration
resulting
from
such
a
station
being
already
in
possession
of
his
inheritance

the
head
of
a
household
the
law
so
arranged
the
conditions
of
his
service
as
to
as
much
as
possible
the
calamity
which
had
reduced
him
from
independence

penury

subjection
the
import
of
the
command
which
concludes
this
topic
in
the
verse
thou
shalt
not
rule
over
him
with
rigor
is
manifestly
this
you
shall
not
disregard
those
differences
in
previous
associations
station
authority
and
political
privileges
upon
which
this
regulation
is
based
for
to
hold
this
class
of
servants
of
these
distinctions
and
annihilating
them
is
to
rule
with
rigor
the
same
command
is
repeated
in
the
verse
and
applied
to
the
distinction
between
servants
of
jewish
and
those
of
gentile
extraction
and
forbids
the
overlooking
of
distinctive
jewish
peculiarities
the
disregard
of
which
would
be
in
the
extreme
b
the
construction
commonly
put
upon
the
phrase
rule
with
rigor
and
the
inference
drawn
from
it
have
an
air
vastly
oracular
it
is
interpreted
to
mean
you
shall
not
make
him
a
chattel
and
strip
him
of
legal
protection
nor
force
him
to
work
without
pay
the
inference
is
like
unto
it
since
the
command
forbade
such
outrages
upon
the
israelites
it
permitted
and
commissioned
their
infliction
upon
the
strangers
such
impious
and
shallow
smattering
captivates
scoffers
and
libertines
its
flippancy
and
blasphemy
and
the
strong
scent
of
its
license
works
like
a
charm
upon
them
what
boots
it
to
reason
against
such
rampant
affinities
in
ex
i
it
is
said
that
the
egyptians
made
the
children
of
israel
to
with
rigor
this
rigor
is
affirmed
of
the
of
extorted
and
the
of
the
exaction
the
expression
serve
with
rigor
is
never
applied
to
the
service
of
servants
under
the
mosaic
system
the
phrase
thou
shalt
not
rule
over
him
with
rigor
does
not
prohibit
unreasonable
exactions
of
labor
nor
inflictions
of
cruelty
such
were
provided
against
otherwise
but
it
forbids
confounding
the
distinctions
between
a
jew
and
a
stranger
by
assigning
the
former
to
the

grade
of

we
are
now
prepared
to
review
at
a
glance
the
condition
of
the
different
classes
of
servants
with
the
modifications
peculiar
to
each
class
in
the
possession
of
all
fundamental
rights
all
classes
of
servants
were
on
an
absolute
equality
all
were
equally
protected
by
law
in
their
persons
character
property
and
social
relations
all
were
voluntary
all
were
compensated
for
their
labor
and
released
from
it
nearly
half
of
the
days
in
each
year
all
were
furnished
with
stated
instruction
none
in
either
class
were
in
any
sense
articles
of
property
all
were
regarded
as
with
the
rights
interests
hopes
and
destinies
of
in
all
these
respects
classes
of
servants
among
the
israelites
formed
but
one
class
the
classes
and
the
differences
in
class
were
this
class
consisted
both
of
israelites
and
strangers
their
employments
were
different
the
was
an
agricultural
servant
the
stranger
was
a
and
servant
and
in
some
instances
both
were
occasional
and
temporary
both
lived
in
their
own
families
their
wages
were
and
they
were
paid
when
their
work
was
done
including
those
born
in
the
house
this
class
also
consisted
of
israelites
and
strangers
the
same
difference
in
their
kinds
of
employments
noticed
before
both
were
paid
in
advance
a
and
neither
was
temporary
the
israelitish
servant
with
the
exception
of
the
was
released
after
six
years
the
stranger
was
a
permanent
servant
continuing
until
the
jubilee
a
marked
distinction
obtained
also
between
different
classes
of
bought
servants
ordinarily
they
were
merged
in
their
master
family
and
like
his
wife
and
children
subject
to
his
authority
and
like
them
protected
by
law
from
its
abuse
but
the
was
a
marked
exception
his
family
relations
and
authority
remained
unaffected
nor
was
he
subjected
as
an
inferior
to
the
control
of
his
master
though
dependent
upon
him
for
employment
footnote
a
the
payment
doubtless
lessened
the
price
of
the
purchase
the
servant
thus
having
the
use
of
the
money
and
the
master
assuming
all
the
risks
of
life
and
health
for
labor
at
the
expiration
of
the
six
year
contract
the
master
having
suffered
no
loss
from
the
risk
incurred
at
the
making
of
it
was
obliged
by
law
to
release
the
servant
with
a
liberal
gratuity
the
reason
assigned
for
this
is
he
hath
been
worth
a
double
hired
servant
unto
thee
in
serving
thee
six
years
as
if
it
had
been
said
as
you
have
experienced
no
loss
from
the
risks
of
life
and
ability
to
labor
incurred
in
the
purchase
and
which
lessened
the
price
and
as
by
being
your
servant
for
six
years
he
has
saved
you
the
time
and
trouble
of
looking
up
and
hiring
laborers
on
emergencies
therefore
thou
shalt
furnish
him
liberally
it
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
classes
of
servants
the
israelite
and
the
stranger
not
only
enjoyed
natural
and
religious
but
the
civil
and
political
enjoyed
by
those
of
their
own
people
who
were
servants
they
also
shared
in
common
with
them
the
political
disabilities
which
appertained
to
all
strangers
whether
the
servants
of
jewish
masters
or
the
masters
of
jewish
servants
further
the
disabilities
of
the
servants
from
the
strangers
were
exclusively
and
they
in
common
with
all
strangers
could
not
own
the
soil
they
were
ineligible
to
civil
offices
they
were
assigned
to
employments
less
honorable
than
those
in
which
israelitish
servants
engaged
agriculture
being
regarded
as
fundamental
to
the
existence
of
the
state
other
employments
were
in
less
repute
and
deemed
finally
the
strangers
whether
servants
or
masters
were
all
protected
equally
with
the
descendants
of
abraham
in
respect
to
political
privileges
their
condition
was
much
like
that
of
naturalized
foreigners
in
the
united
states
whatever
their
wealth
or
intelligence
or
moral
principle
or
love
for
our
institutions
they
can
neither
go
to
the
nor
own
the
soil
nor
be
eligible
to
office
let
a
native
american
be
suddenly
bereft
of
these
privilege
and
loaded
with
the
disabilities
of
an
alien
and
what
to
the
foreigner
would
be
a
light
matter
to
would
be
the
severity
of
the
recent
condition
of
the
jews
and
catholics
in
england
is
another
illustration

citizen
in

and
perhaps

of

who
sued
for
the
smallest
crumbs
of
his
favor
was
as
a
subject
of
the

were
by
law
deprived
of
power
to
own
the
soil
of
eligibility
to

and
of

electoral
franchise
would
englishmen
think
it
a
misapplication
of
language
if
it
were
said
the
government
rules
over
him
with
rigor
and
yet
his
person
property
reputation
conscience
all
his
social
relations
the
disposal
of
his
time
the
right
of
locomotion
at
pleasure
and
of
natural
liberty
in
all
respects
are
just
as
much
protected
by
law
as
the
lord
chancellor
finally
as
the
mosaic
system
was
a
great
compound
type
rife
with
meaning
in
doctrine
and
duty
the
practical
power
of
the
whole
depended
upon
the
exact
observance
of
those
distinctions
and
relations
which
constituted
its
significancy
hence
the
care
to
preserve
serve
inviolate
the
distinction
between
a
of
and
a
even
when
the
stranger
was
a
proselyte
had
gone
through
the
initiatory
ordinances
entered
the
congregation
and
become
incorporated
with
the
israelites
by
family
alliance
the
regulation
laid
down
in
ex
xxi
is
an
illustration
in
this
case
the
israelitish
servant
whose
term
expired
in
six
years
married
one
of
his
master
female
but
her
marriage
did
not
release
her
master
from
part
of
the
contract
for
her
whole
term
of
service
nor
from
his
legal
obligation
to
support
and
educate
her
children
neither
did
it
do
away
that
distinction
which
marked
her
national
descent
by
a
specific
and
of
service
nor
impair
her
obligation
to
fulfill
part
of
the
contract
her
relations
as
a
permanent
domestic
grew
out
of
a
distinction
guarded
with
great
care
throughout
the
mosaic
system
to
render
it
void
would
have
been
to
divide
the
system
against
itself
this
god
would
not
tolerate
nor
on
the
other
hand
would
he
permit
the
master
to
throw
off
the
responsibility
of
instructing
her
children
nor
the
care
and
expense
of
their
helpless
infancy
and
rearing
he
was
bound
to
support
and
educate
them
and
all
her
children
born
afterwards
during
her
term
of
service
the
whole
arrangement
beautifully
illustrates
that
wise
and
tender
regard
for
the
interests
of
all
the
parties
concerned
which
arrays
the
mosaic
system
in
robes
of
glory
and
causes
it
to
shine
as
the
sun
in
the
kingdom
of
our
father
by
this
law
the
children
had
secured
to
them
a
mother
tender
care
if
the
husband
loved
his
wife
and
children
he
could
compel
his
master
to
keep
him
whether
he
had
any
occasion
for
his
services
or
not
if
he
did
not
love
them
to
be
rid
of
him
was
a
blessing
and
in
that
case
the
regulation
would
prove
an
act
for
the
relief
of
an
afflicted
family
it
is
not
by
any
means
to
be
inferred
that
the
release
of
the
servant
in
the
seventh
year
either
absolved
him
from
the
obligations
of
marriage
or
shut
him
out
from
the
society
of
his
family
he
could
doubtless
procure
a
service
at
no
great
distance
from
them
and
might
often
do
it
to
get
higher
wages
or
a
kind
of
employment
better
suited
to
his
taste
and
skill
the
great
number
of
days
on
which
the
law
released
servants
from
regular
labor
would
enable
him
to
spend
much
more
time
with
his
family
than
can
be
spent
by
most
of
the
agents
of
our
benevolent
societies
with
families
or
by
many
merchants
editors
artists
whose
daily
business
is
in
new
york
while
their
families
reside
from
ten
to
one
hundred
miles
in
the
country
we
conclude
this
inquiry
by
touching
briefly
upon
an
objection
which
though
not
formally
stated
has
been
already
set
aside
by
the
whole
tenor
of
the
foregoing
argument
it
is
this
the
slavery
of
the
canaanites
by
the
israelites
was
appointed
by
god
as
a
commutation
of
the
punishment
of
death
denounced
against
them
for
their
sins
if
the
absurdity
of
a
sentence
consigning
persons
to
and
at
the
same
time
to
perpetual
did
not
sufficiently
laugh
at
itself
it
would
be
small
in
a
case
so
tempting
to
make
up
the
deficiency
by
a
general
contribution
for
it
only
statute
was
ever
given
respecting
the
disposition
to
be
made
of
the
inhabitants
of
canaan
if
the
sentence
of
death
was
pronounced
against
them
and
afterwards
when
where
by
whom
and
in
what
terms
was
the
commutation
and
where
is
it
recorded
grant
for
argument
sake
that
all
the
canaanites
were
sentenced
to
unconditional
extermination
as
there
was
no
reversal
of
the
sentence
how
can
a
right
to
them
be
drawn
from
such
premises
the
punishment
of
death
is
one
of
the
highest
recognitions
of
man
moral
nature
possible
it
proclaims
him
rational
accountable
guilty
deserving
death
for
having
done
his
utmost
to
cheapen
human
life
when
the
proof
of
its
priceless
worth
lived
in
his
own
nature
but
to
make
him
a
cheapens
to
nothing
human
and
instead
of
healing
a
wound
gives
a
what
repair
an
injury
to
rational
being
in
the
robbery
of
of
its
rights
by
robbing
it
of
and
annihilating
their
the
everlasting
distinction
between
persons
and
things
to
make
a
man
a
chattel
is
not
the
but
the
of
a
being
and
so
far
as
it
goes
of
human
beings
this
commutation
of
the
punishment
of
death
into
perpetual
slavery
what
a
fortunate
discovery
alas
for
the
honor
of
deity
if
commentators
had
not
manned
the
forlorn
hope
and
by
a
timely
movement
rescued
the
divine
character
at
the
very
crisis
of
its
fate
from
the
perilous
position
in
which
inspiration
had
carelessly
left
it
here
a
question
arises
of
sufficient
importance
for
a
separate
dissertation
but
must
for
the
present
be
disposed
of
in
a
few
paragraphs
were
the
canaanites
sentenced
by
god
to
individual
and
unconditional
extermination
as
the
limits
of
this
inquiry
forbid
our
giving
all
the
grounds
of
dissent
from
commonly
received
opinions
the
suggestions
made
will
be
thrown
out
merely
as
queries
rather
than
laid
down
as
the
directions
as
to
the
disposal
of
the
canaanites
are
mainly
in
the
following
passages
ex
xxiii

in
these
verses
the
israelites
are
commanded
to
destroy
the
canaanites
drive
out

utterly

put
out
dispossess
them
did
these
commands
enjoin
the
unconditional
and
universal
destruction
of
the
or
merely
of
the
politic
the
word
to
destroy
signifies
as
well
as
individual
destruction
the
destruction
of
existence
equally
with
of
governmental
organization
equally
with
the
lives
of
the
subjects
besides
if
we
interpret
the
words
destroy
consume
overthrow
to
mean
destruction
what
meaning
shall
we
give
to
the
expressions
throw
out
before
thee
cast
out
before
thee
expel
put
out

which
are
used

make
all
thine

here
thine

to
their

the
to
be
does
this
mean
that
god
would
let
all
their
escape
but
kill
all
their
or
that
he
would
kill
all
the
people
and
then
make
them
turn
their
backs

army
of
runaway
corpses
if
these
commands
required
the
destruction

that

deut
xx
will
probably
be
quoted
against
the
preceding
view
we
argue
that
the
command
in
these
verses
did
not
include
all
the
individuals
of
the
canaanitish
nations
but
only
the
inhabitants
of
the
and
even
those
conditionally
because
only
the
inhabitants
of
the
are
specified
of
the
of
these
people
thou
shalt
save
alive
nothing
that
breatheth
cities
then
as
now
were
of
vice
they
reeked
with
abominations
little
practiced
in
the
country
on
this
account
their
influence
would
be
far
more
perilous
to
the
israelites
than
that
of
the
country
besides
they
were
the
centres
of
idolatry
there
were
the
temples
and
altars
and
idols
and
priests
without
number
even
their
buildings
streets
and
public
walks
were
so
many
visibilities
of
idolatry
the
reason
assigned
in
the
verse
for
exterminating
them
strengthens
the
idea
that
they
teach
you
not
to
do
after
all
the
abominations
which
they
have
done
unto
their
gods
this
would
be
a
reason
for
exterminating
the
nations
and
individuals
them
as
all
were
idolaters
but
god
commanded
them
in
certain
cases
to
spare
the
inhabitants
contact
with
of
them
would
be
perilous
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
peculiarly
and
of
the
cities
so
the
and
verses
contain
the
general
rule
prescribing
the
method
in
which
cities
were
to
be
summoned
to
surrender
they
were
first
to
receive
the
offer
of
peace
if
it
was
accepted
the
inhabitants
became
but
if
they
came
out
against
israel
in
battle
the
were
to
be
killed
and
the
women
and
little
ones
saved
alive
the
verse
restricts
this
lenient
treatment
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
cities
the
directs
as
to
the
disposal
of
the
inhabitants
of
canaanitish
cities
they
were
to
save
alive
nothing
that
breathed
the
common
mistake
has
been
in
supposing
that
the
command
in
the
verse
refers
to
the
system
of
directions
commencing
with
the
whereas
it
manifestly
refers
only
to
the
specified
in
the
and
making
a
distinction
between
those
cities
that
and
the
cities
that
fought
in
one
case
destroying
the
males
and
females
and
in
the
other
the
only
the
offer
of
peace
and
the
were
as
really
guarantied
to
cities
as
to
others
their
inhabitants
were
not
to
be
exterminated
unless
they
came
out
against
israel
in
battle
but
let
us
settle
this
question
by
the
law
and
the
testimony
there
was
not
a
city
that
made
peace
with
the
children
of
israel
save
the
hivites
the
inhabitants
of
gibeon
all
others
they
took
in
battle
for
it
was
of
the
lord
to
harden
their
hearts
that
they
should
come
out
against
israel
in
battle
that
he
might
destroy
them
utterly
and
that
they
might
have
no
favor
but
that
he
might
destroy
them
as
the
lord
commanded
moses
josh
xix
that
is
if
they
had
come
out
against
israel
in
battle
they
would
have
had
favor
shown
them
and
would
not
have
been
the
great
design
was
to
the
of
the
canaanites
to
the
israelites
and
along
with
it
sovereignty
in
every
to
annihilate
their
political
organizations
civil
polity
and
jurisprudence
and
their
system
of
religion
with
all
its
rights
and
appendages
and
to
substitute
therefor
a
pure
theocracy
administered
by
jehovah
with
the
israelites
as
his
representatives
and
agents
in
a
word
the
people
were
to
be
their
political
existence
annihilated
their
idol
temples
altars
images
groves
and
heathen
rites
destroyed
and
themselves
put
under
tribute
those
who
resisted
the
execution
of
jehovah
purpose
were
to
be
killed
while
those
who
quietly
submitted
to
it
were
to
be
spared
all
had
the
choice
of
these
alternatives
either
free
egress
out
of
the
land
c
or
acquiescence
in
the
decree
with
life
and
residence
as
tributaries
under
the
protection
of
the
government
or
resistance
to
the
execution
of
the
decree
with
death
it
shall
come
to
pass
if
they
will
diligently
learn
the
ways
of
my
people
to
swear
by
my
name

they
taught
my
people

by

footnote

perhaps
it
will
be
objected
that
the
preservation
of
the
gibeonites
and
of
rahab
and
her
kindred
was
a
violation
of
the
command
of
god
we
answer
if
it
had
been
we
might
expect
some
such
intimation
if
god
had
strictly
commanded
them
to
all
the
their
pledge
to
save
themselves
was
neither
a
repeal
of
the
statute
nor
absolution
for
the
breach
of
it
if
was
the
import
of
the
command
would
god
have
permitted
such
an
act
to
pass
without
rebuke
would
he
have
established
such
a
precedent
when
israel
had
hardly
passed
the
threshold
of
canaan
and
was
then
striking
the
first
blow
of
a
half
century
war
what
if
they
passed
their
word
to
rahab
and
the
gibeonites
was
that
more
binding
than
god
command
so
saul
seems
to
have
passed
word
to
agag
yet
samuel
hewed
him
in
pieces
because
in
saving
his
life
saul
had
violated
god
command
when
saul
sought
to
slay
the
gibeonites
in
his
zeal
for
the
children
of
israel
and
judah
god
sent
upon
israel
three
years
famine
for
it
when
david
inquired
of
them
what
atonement
he
should
make
they

the
man
that
devised
against
us
that
we
should
be
destroyed

was
it

much

therefore
slaves
to
confound

is

slavery
is
a
the

toward

can
not
alter
its

whether

the

remains
the

the

willingness
to
be
a

is
no
palliation
of
the

suppose
he
should
really
believe
himself

to
be
so
regarded
by

blot
out
his

of
it
the
slave
willingness
to
be
a
slave
so
far
from
lessening
the
guilt
of
his
owner
aggravates
it
if
slavery
has
so
palsied
his
mind
that
he
looks
upon
himself
as
a
chattel
and
consents
to
be
one
actually
to
hold
him
as
such
falls
in
with
his
delusion
and
confirms
the
impious
falsehood
these
very
feelings
and
convictions
of
the
slave
if
such
were
possible
increase
a
hundred
fold
the
guilt
of
the
master
and
call
upon
him
in
thunder
immediately
to
recognize
him
as
a
man
and
thus
break
the
sorcery
that
cheats
him
out
of
his
birthright
the
consciousness
of
his
worth
and

many
of
the
foregoing
conditions
are
of
slavery
but
no
one
nor
all
of
them
together
constitute

was
taken
the
penalty
for
stealing
property
was
a
mere
however
large
the
theft
the
payment
of
double
wiped
out
the
score
it
might
have
a
greater
money
value
than
a
thousand
men
yet
death
was
not
the
penalty
nor
maiming
nor
braiding
nor
even
stripes
but
double
the
same
why
was
not
the
rule
uniform
when
a
was
stolen
why
was
not
the
thief
required
to
restore
double
of
the
same
kind
two
men
or
if
he
had
sold
him
five
men
do
you
say
that
the
might
not
them
so
the
might
not
have
two
oxen
or
if
he
had
killed
it
five
but
if
god
permitted
men
to
hold
as
property
equally
with
oxen
the
could
get
men
with
whom
to
pay
the
penalty
as
well
as
the
oxen
further
when
property
was
stolen
the
legal
penalty
was
a
compensation
to
the
person
injured
but
when
a
was
stolen
no
property
compensation
was
offered
to
tender
money
as
an
equivalent
would
have
been
to
repeat
the
outrage
with
intolerable
aggravations
compute
the
value
of
a
man
in
throw
dust
into
the
scale
against
immortality
the
law
recoiled
from
such
supreme
insult
and
impiety
to
have
permitted
the
to
expiate
his
crime
by
restoring
double
would
have
been
making
the
repetition
of
crime
its
atonement
but
the
infliction
of
death
for
exacted
the
utmost
possibility
of
reparation
it
wrung
from
the
guilty
wretch
as
he
gave
up
the
ghost
the
testimony
of
blood
and
to
the
infinite
dignity
and
worth
of
man
a
proclamation
to
the
universe
voiced
in
mortal
agony
man
is
inviolable
a
confession
shrieked
in
phrenzy
at
the
grave
mouth
i
die
accursed
and
god
is
just
footnote
a
those
are
who
abduct
sell
or
buy
slaves
or
freemen
grotius
if
god
permitted
man
to
hold
man
as
property
why
did
he
punish
for
stealing
that
kind
of
property
infinitely
more
than
for
stealing
any
other
kind
of
property
why
punish
with
death
for
stealing
a
very
little
of
sort
of
property
and
make
a
mere
fine
the
penalty
for
stealing
a
thousand
times
as
much
of
any
other
sort
of
property
especially
if
by
his
own
act
god
had
annihilated
the
difference
between
man
and
by
putting
him
on
a
level
with
it
the
guilt
of
a
crime
depends
much
upon
the
nature
character
and
condition
of
the
victim
to
steal
is
a
crime
whoever
the
thief
or
whatever
the
plunder
to
steal
bread
from
a
full
man
is
theft
to
steal
it
from
a
starving
man
is
both
theft
and
murder
if
i
steal
my
neighbor
property
the
crime
consists
not
in
altering
the
of
the
article
but
in
taking
as
what
is
but
when
i
take
my
neighbor
himself
and
first
make
him
and
then
property
the
latter
act
which
was
the
sole
crime
in
the
former
case
dwindles
to
nothing
the
sin
in
stealing
a
man
is
not
the
transfer
from
its
owner
to
another
of
that
which
is
already
property
but
the
turning
of
into
true
the
attributes
of
man
remain
but
the
rights
and
immunities
which
grow
out
of
them
are
annihilated
it
is
the
first
law
both
of
reason
and
revelation
to
regard
things
and
beings
as
they
are
and
the
sum
of
religion
to
feel
and
act
toward
them
according
to
their
value
knowingly
to
treat
them
otherwise
is
sin
and
the
degree
of
violence
done
to
their
nature
relations
and
value
measures
its
guilt
when
things
are
sundered
which
god
has
indissolubly
joined
or
confounded
in
one
which
he
has
separated
by
infinite
extremes
when
sacred
and
eternal
distinctions
which
he
has
garnished
with
glory
are
derided
and
set
at
nought
then
if
ever
sin
reddens
to
its
scarlet
dye
the
sin
specified
in
the
passage
is
that
of
doing
violence
to
the
of
a
to
his
intrinsic
value
as
a
rational
being
in
the
verse
preceding
the
one
under
consideration
and
in
that
which
follows
the
same
principle
is
laid
down
verse
he
that
smiteth
his
father
or
his
mother
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
verse
he
that
curseth
his
father
or
his
mother
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
if
a
jew
smote
his
neighbor
the
law
merely
smote
him
in
return
but
if
the
blow
was
given
to
a
it
struck
the
smiter
dead
the
parental
relation
is
the
of
human
society
god
guards
it
with
peculiar
care
to
violate
that
is
to
violate
all
whoever
tramples
on
that
shows
that
relation
has
any
sacredness
in
his
eyes
that
he
is
unfit
to
move
among
human
relations
who
violates
one
so
sacred
and
tender
therefore
the
mosaic
law
uplifted
his
bleeding
corpse
and
brandished
the
ghastly
terror
around
the
parental
relation
to
guard
it
from
impious
inroads
why
such
a
difference
in
penalties
for
the
same
act
answer
the
relation
violated
was
obvious
the
distinction
between
parents
and
others
dictated
by
a
law
of
nature
the
act
was
violence
to
nature
a
suicide
on
constitutional
susceptibilities
the
parental
relation
then
as
now
was
the
focal
point
of
the
social
system
and
required
powerful
thy
father
and
thy
stands
at
the
head
of
those
commands
which
prescribe
the
duties
of
man
to
man
and
throughout
the
bible
the
parental
state
is
god
favorite
illustration
of
his
own
relations
to
the
human
family
in
this
case
death
was
to
be
inflicted
not
for
smiting
a
but
a
made
sacred
by
god
and
fortified
by
a
bulwark
of
defence
in
the
next
verse
he
that
stealeth
a
man
the
same
principle
is
wrought
out
in
still
stronger
relief
the
crime
to
be
punished
with
death
was
not
the
taking
of
property
from
its
owner
but
violence
to
an
the
blotting
out
of
a
sacred
making
men
chattels
the
incessant
pains
taken
in
the
old
testament
to
separate
human
beings
from
brutes
and
things
shows
god
regard
for
this
his
own
distinction
in
the
beginning
he
proclaimed
it
to
the
universe
as
it
rose
into
being
creation
stood
up
at
the
instant
of
its
birth
to
do
it
homage
it
paused
in
adoration
while
god
ushered
forth
its
crowning
work
why
that
dread
pause
and
that
creating
arm
held
back
in
mid
career
and
that
high
conference
in
the
godhead
let
us
make
man
in
our
image
after
our
likeness
and
let
him
have
dominion
over
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
over
the
fowl
of
the
air
and
over
the
cattle
and
over
all
the
earth
then
while
every
living
thing
with
land
and
sea
and
firmament
and
marshalled
worlds
waited
to
swell
the
shout
of
morning
stars
then
god
created
man
in
his
own
image
in
the
image
of
god
created
he
him
this
solves
the
problem
in
the
image
of
god
created
he
him
this
distinction
is
often
repeated
and
always
with
great
solemnity
in
i
it
is
expressed
in
various
forms
in
we
find
it
again
in
the
likeness
of
god
made
he
him
in
ix
again
after
giving
license
to
shed
the
blood
of
every
moving
thing
that
liveth
it
is
added
sheddeth
man
blood
by
man
shall
his
blood
be
shed
in
the
image
of

man
as
though
it
had
been
said
all
these
creatures
are
your
property
designed
for
your
use
they
have
the
likeness
of
earth
and
their
spirits
go
downward
but
this
other
being
man
has
my
own
likeness
in
the
image
of
god
made
i
man
an
intelligent
moral
immortal
agent
invited
to
all
that
i
can
give
and
he
can
be
so
in

he
that
killeth
any

surely
be
put
to
death

he
that

thus

mutilate
his
image
and
blaspheme
the
holy
one
who
saith

thus

in
further
prosecuting
this
inquiry
the
patriarchal
and
mosaic
systems
will
be
considered
together
as
each
reflects

as
many
regulations
of

the
question
to
be
settled
by
us
is
not
what
were

what
were
the
rules
that
god
gave
for
the
regulation

customs

those
who
insist

the
patriarchs
held
slaves

sit
with
such
delight

their
shadow
hymning
the
praises
of
those
good
old
slaveholders
and
patriarchs

at
small
cost
greatly
augment
their
numbers
a
single
stanza
celebrating
patriarchal

off
with
a
chorus
in
honor
of

be
a
summoning
from

each
claiming
abraham

as
his
patron
saint
and
shouting
my

legion
a
myriad
choir
and
thunderous
song
before
entering
upon
an
analysis
of
the
condition
of
servants
under
these
two
states
of
society
we
will
consider
the
import
of
certain
terms
which
describe
the
mode
of
procuring
them
import
of
buy
and
bought
with
money
as
the
israelites
were
commanded
to
buy
their
servants
and
as
abraham
had
servants
bought
with
money
it
is
argued
that
servants
were
articles
of
property
the
sole
ground
for
this
belief
is
terms
themselves
how
much
might
be
saved
if
in
discussion
the
thing
to
be
proved
were
always
to
beg
the
question
in
debate
is
vast
economy
of
midnight
oil
and
a
wholesale
forestaller
of
wrinkles
and
gray
hairs
instead
of
protracted
investigation
into
scripture
usage
painfully
collating
passages
to
settle
the
meaning
of
terms
let
every
man
interpret
the
oldest
book
in
the
world
by
the
usages
of
his
own
time
and
place
and
the
work
is
done
and
then
instead
of
one
revelation
they
might
be
multiplied
as
the
drops
of
the
morning
and
every
man
have
an
infallible
clue
to
the
mind
of
the
spirit
in
the
dialect
of
his
own
neighborhood
what
a
to
take
it
for
granted
that
the
sense
in
which
words
are
used
is
the
sense
david
says
i
prevented
the
dawning
of

this
sense

testaments
david

in
the
english
of
the
nineteenth
century
would
be
before

i
cried
in
almost
every

nearly

in

is
more
mutable
than

always
throwing
off
some
particles
and
absorbing
others
so
long
as
they
are
mere
representatives
elected
by
the
whims
of
universal
suffrage
their
meaning
will
be
a
perfect
volatile
and
to
cork
it
up
for
the
next
century
is
an
employment
sufficiently
silly
to
speak
within
bounds
for
a
modern
maker
there
never
was
a
shallower
conceit
than
that
of
establishing
the
sense
attached
to
a
word
centuries
ago
by
showing
what
it
means
pity
that
fashionable
mantuamakers
were
not
a
little
quicker
at
taking
hints
from
some
doctors
of
divinity
how
easily
they
might
save
their
pious
customers
all
qualms
of
conscience
about
the
weekly
shiftings
of
fashion
by
proving
that
the
last
importation
of
parisian
indecency
now
showing
off
on

was
the
very
style
of
dress
in
which
the

a
fashion
flaunts

trailed

four
thousand

the
inference
that
the
word
buy
used
to
describe
the
procuring
of
servants
means
procuring
them
as
seems
based
upon
the
fallacy
that
whatever
money
money
that
whatever
or
whoever
you
pay

article
of
property

the
fact

informs
us
that
this

was
paid

those
who
insist
that
the

which
the

were

were
round

were
to
be

the
inconsistency
of
recognizing
and
affirming
the
right
of
those
very
persons
to
freedom
upon
whom
say
they

pronounced
the
doom
of

for
they
tell
us
that
the
sentence
of
death
uttered
against
those
heathen
was
commuted
into
slavery
which
punishment
god
denounced
against
them
now
if
the
heathen
round
about
were
doomed

the
were
doomed
as
well
as
the
where
we

did
the

the
right
of

that
the
of
what
was
sold
existed
which
and
ownership
he
commanded
them
to

we
repeat
the
question
where
did
the
heathen
get
their
right
to
sell
since
were
dispossessed
of
their
right
to
and
doomed
to
slavery
equally
with
those
whom
they
sold
did
god
decree
vest
in
them
a
right
to
while
it
annulled
their
right
to
if
as
the
objector
argument
assumes
one
part
of
the
heathen
round
about
were
held
as
slaves
by
the
other
part
of
course
were
not
to
slavery
for
they
were
already
slaves
so
also
if
those
heathen
who
held
them
as
slaves
had
a
to
hold
them
which
right
god
commanded
the
israelites
to
thus
requiring
them
to
recognize
as
a
and
on
no
account
to
procure
its
transfer
to
themselves
without
paying
to
the
holders
an
equivalent
surely
these
were
not
doomed
by
god
to
be
slaves
for
according
to
the
objector
god
had
himself
affirmed
their
right
hold
others
as
and
commanded
his
people
to
respect
it
we
now
proceed
to
inquire
into
the
of
servants
under
the
patriarchal
and
mosaic
systems
i
the
rights
and
privileges
of
servants
the
leading
design
of
the
laws
defining
the
relations
of
master
and
servant
was
the
good
of
both
parties
more
especially
the
good
of
the
while
the
master
interests
were
guarded
from
injury
those
of
the
servants
were
these
laws
made
a
merciful
provision
for
the
poorer
classes
both
of
the
israelites
and
strangers
not
laying
on
burdens
but
lightening
them
they
were
a
grant
of
and
i
buying
servants
was
regarded
as
a
kindness
to
the
persons
bought
and
as
establishing
between
them
and
their
purchasers
a
bond
of
affection
and
confidence
this
is
plain
from
the
frequent
use
of
it
to
illustrate
the
love
and
care
of
god
for
his
chosen
people

in
the
light
of
this
fact
look
at
the
relation
sustained
by
a
proselyted

it

of

in

we
may
add

a

neglected
the
observance

ceremonial
rite
and
was
on

account
excommunicated
from

congregation

were
persons
made

against
their

we
argue
that
they

own
accord

was
to
become

of

the

all
these
processes

the
renunciation
of

they

they
abhorred
the

spurned
the
laws
that
enjoined

its
author
and
its
executors
and
instead
of
rejoicing
in
the
deliverance
which
it
commemorated
bewailed
it
as
a
calamity
and
cursed
the
day
of
its
consummation

parts

disgusting
mummeries

the
tactics
of
a
creed

with

repeat

this
point
whether

an
israelite

whether

the

to

though

had
said
to

him
up
would
be
to
recognize
the

master
to
hold
him
his
shows

his
wrongs
and
his
title
to
protection
you
shall
not
force
him
back

thus
recognize
the

the
master
to
hold
him
in
such
a
condition
as
induces
him
to
flee

others
for
protection
it
may
be
said
that
this
command
referred
only
to
the
servants
of
masters
in
the
surrounding

we
answer
the
terms
of
the
command
are
unlimited
but
the
objection
if
valid
would
merely
shift
the
pressure
of
the
difficulty
to
another
point
did
god
require
them
to
protect
the
of
a
servant
from
the
heathen
and
yet
the
same
persons
to
crush
the
free
choice
of
of
servants
from
the
heathen
suppose
a
case
a
servant
escapes
to
the
israelites
god
says
he
shall
dwell
with
thee
in
that
place
which
shall
in
one
of
thy
gates
where
it
best
now
suppose
this
same
servant
instead
of
coming
into
israel
of
his
own
accord
had
been
in
by
some
kidnapper
who
bought
him
of
his
master
and
forced
him
into
a
condition
against
his
will
would
he
who
forbade
such
treatment
of
the
stranger
who
came
into
the
land
sanction
the
same
treatment
of
the
provided
in
addition
to
this
last
outrage
the
previous
one
had
been
committed
of
forcing
him
into
the
nation
against
his
will
to
commit
violence
on
the
free
choice
of
a
foreign
servant
is
forsooth
a
horrible
enormity
provided
you
the
violence
he
has
come
among
you
but
if
you
commit
the
first
act
on
the
side
of
the
if
you
begin
the
outrage
by
buying
him
from
a
third
person
against
his
will
and
then
tear
him
from
home
drag
him
across
the
line
into
the
land
of
israel
and
hold
him
as
a
slave
ah
that
alters
the
case
and
you
may
perpetrate
the
violence
now
with
impunity
would
favor
have
been
shown
to
this
new
comer
than
to
the
old
residents
those
who
had
been
servants
in
jewish
families
perhaps
for
a
generation
were
the
israelites
commanded
to
exercise
towards
uncircumcised
and
out
of
the
covenant
a
justice
and
kindness
denied
to
the
multitudes
who
circumcised
and
the
covenant
but
the
objector
finds
small
gain
to
his
argument
on
the
supposition
that
the
covenant
respected
merely
the
fugitives
from
the
surrounding
nations
while
it
left
the
servants
of
the
israelites
in
a
condition
against
their
wills
in
that
case
the
surrounding
nations
would
adopt
retaliatory
measures
and
become
so
many
asylums
for
jewish
fugitives
as
these
nations
were
not
only
on
every
side
of
them
but
in
their
midst
such
a
proclamation
would
have
been
an
effectual
lure
to
men
whose
condition
was
a
constant
counteraction
of
will
besides
the
same
command
which
protected
the
servant
from
the
power
of
his
foreign
protected
him
equally
from
the
power
of
an
it
was
not
merely
thou
shalt
not
deliver
him
unto
his
but
he
shall
dwell
with
thee
in
that
place
which
shall
in
one
of
thy
gates
where
it
liketh
best
every
israelite
was
forbidden
to
put
him

any
condition

was
this
but
a
proclamation
that
all
who
to
live
in
the
land
and
obey
the
laws
were
left
to
their
own
free
will
to
dispose
of
their
services
at
such
a
rate
to
such
persons
and
in
such
places
as
they
pleased
besides
grant
that
this
command
prohibited
the
sending
back
of
servants
only
there
was
no
law
requiring
the
return
of
servants
who
had
escaped
from
the
lost
and
escaped
they
were
required
to
return
but
not
escaped
these
verses
contain
a
command
thou
shalt
not
deliver
a
declaration
of
the
fugitive
right
of
and
of
god
will
that
he
should
exercise
it
at
his
own
discretion
and
a
command
guarding
this
right
namely
thou
shalt
not

him
as
though

perhaps
it
may
be
objected
that
this
view
of

makes
nonsense
of

which
provides
that
if
a
man
strikes
out
his
servant
tooth
he
shall
let
him
go

small
favor
indeed
if
the
servant
might
set
himself
free
whenever
he
pleased

the
former
passage
might
remove
the
servant
from
the

annulling
the
master

claims
upon
the
servant
if
he
had
paid
him
in
advance
and
had
not
received
from
him
an
equivalent
and
this
equally
whether
his
master
were
a
jew
or
a
gentile
the
latter
passage
he
shall
let
him
go
free
his
sake
not
only
freed
the
servant
from
the
master
authority
but
also
from
any
pecuniary
claim
which
the
master
might
have
on
account
of
having
paid
his
wages
in

this

of

servants
of
the

necessarily
voluntary
abraham
servants
are
an
illustration
at
one
time
he
had
three
hundred
and
eighteen
born
in
his
house
and
many
more
born
in
his
house
his
servants
of
all
ages
were
probably
many
thousands
how
did
abraham
and
sarah
contrive
to
hold
fast
so
many
thousand
servants
against
their
wills
the
most
natural
supposition
is
that
the
patriarch
and
his
wife
took
turns
in
surrounding
them
the
neighboring
tribes
instead
of
constituting
a
picket
guard
to
hem
in
his
servants
would
have
been
far
more
likely
to
sweep
them
and
him
into
captivity
as
they
did

and
his
household
besides
there
was
neither
constitution
nor
compact
to
send
back
abraham
fugitives
nor
a
truckling
police
to
pounce
upon
them
nor
suing
for
his

volunteering
to
howl
on

boasting
their
scent

pledging
their
honour
to
hunt
down
and
deliver
up
provided
they
had
a

of

were
suitably
stimulated
by

of

a
abraham
seems
also
to
have
been
sadly
deficient
in
all
the
auxiliaries
of
family
government
such
as
stocks
yokes
gags
and
his
destitution
of
these
patriarchal
indispensables
is
the
more
afflicting
since
he
faithfully
trained
his
household
to
do
justice
and
judgment
though
so
deplorably
destitute
of
the
needful
aids

that

staid

of
their

proved
by
the
of
their

suppose
they

so
the
whole

had

how

the

servants
being
held

is
not
the

proof
of
their
voluntary

have
his
own
explicit
testimony
that
he
had
not
withheld
from
the

of
course
he
could
hardly
have
made
them

forced

sojourned

he
had

we
have
his
testimony
that

hated

added
to
that
of
inspiration
that
they
envied
him
of
course
they
would
hardly
volunteer
to
organize
patroles

of
vigilance
to
keep
his

from

away

to
drive
back
all
who
were
found
beyond

under
nehemiah
may
be
included
under
this
head
that
they
remained
with
their
masters
of
their
own
accord
we
argue
from
the
fact
that
the
circumstances
of
the
jews
made
it
impossible
for
them
to
their
residence
and
service
they
were
few
in
number
without
resources
defensive
fortifications
or
munitions
of
war
and
surrounded
withal
by
a
host
of
foes
scoffing
at
their
feebleness
and
inviting
desertion
from
their
ranks
yet
so
far
from
the
jews
attempting
in
any
way
to
restrain
their
servants
or
resorting
to
precautions
to
prevent
escape
they
put
arms
into
their
hands
and
enrolled
them
as
a
for
the
defence
of
the
city
by
cheerfully
engaging
in
this
service
and
in
labor
by
day
when
with
entire
ease
they
might
all
have
left
their
masters
marched
over
to
the
enemy
and
been
received
with
shoutings
the
servants
testified
that
their
condition
was
one
of
own
and
that
they
regarded
their
own
interests
as
inseparably
identified
with
those
of
their
masters
neh

no
instances
of

masters
selling

neither

made
good
the
injury

paid

fine

seem
to
have
had

annihilate
the

disposal
but
says
the
objector
to
give
the

a
right
to
a
servant
equally
annihilates
the

it
is
one
thing

have

voluntary
servants
from
the
strangers
we
infer
that
the
servants
from
the

were
voluntary
in
becoming
such

direct
testimony
that
some
of
them
were

deut
xxiv
we
learn
from
this
that
some
of
the
servants
which
the
israelites
obtained
from
the
strangers
were
procured
by
presenting
the
inducement
of
to
their
thus
recognizing
their
right
to
sell
their
services
to
others
or
not
at
their
own
pleasure
did
the
israelites
when
they
went
among
the
heathen
to
procure
servants
take
money
in
one
hand
and
ropes
in
the
other
did
they
one
man
to
engage
in
their
service
and
along
with
them
the
next
that
they
met
in
spite
of
his
struggles
did
they
knock
for
admission
at
one
door
and
break
down
the
next
did
they
go
through
one
village
with
friendly
salutations
and
respectful
demeanor
and
with
the
air
of
those
soliciting
favors
offer
wages
to
the
inhabitants
as
an
inducement
to
engage
in
their
service

they
sent
on
their
agents

viii
hebrew
servants
voluntary
we
infer
that
the
hebrew
servant
was
voluntary
in
commencing
his
service
because
he
was
preeminently
so
in
continuing
it
if
at
the
year
of
release
it
was
the
servant
to
remain
with
his
master
the
law
required
his
ear
to
be
bored
by
the
judges
of
the
land
thus
making
it
impossible
for
him
to
be
held
against
his
will
yea
more
his
master
was
to
keep
him
however
much
he
might
wish
to
get
rid
of
him

manner
of
procuring
servants

appeal

choice
the
israelites
were
commanded
to
offer
them
a
suitable
inducement
and
then
leave
them
to
decide
they
might
neither
seize
them
by
nor
frighten
them
by
nor
wheedle
them
by
false
pretences
nor
them
nor
them
but
they
were
commanded
to
buy
them
a
that
is
they
were
to
recognize
the
of
the
individuals
to
of
their
own
services
and
their
right
to
all
and
thus
oblige
those
who
made
them

were

were

lev
i
the
pertinence
and
point
of
our
lord
declaration
in
luke
xvi
is
destroyed
on
the
supposition
that
servants
did
not
become
such
by
own
no
servant
can
serve
two
masters
for
either
he
will
hate
the
one
and
love
the
other
or
else
he
will
hold
to
the
one
and
despise
the
other
let
it
be
kept
in
mind
that
our
lord
was
a
the
lost
sheep
of
the
house
of
israel
were
his
flock
wherever
he
went
they
were
around
him
whenever
he
spake
they
were
his
auditors
his
public
preaching
and
his
private
teaching
and
conversation
were
full
of
references
to
their
own
institutions
laws
and
usages
and
of
illustrations
drawn
from
them
in
the
verse
quoted
he
illustrates
the
impossibility
of
their
making
choice
of
god
as
their
portion
and
becoming
his
servants
while
they
chose
the
world
and
were
servants
to
make
this
clear
he
refers
to
one
of
their
own
institutions
that
of
with
which
in
all
its
relations
incidents
and
usages
they
were
perfectly
familiar
he
reminds
them
of
the
impossibility
of
any
person
being
the
servant
of
two
masters
and
declares
the
sole
ground
of
that
impossibility
to
be
the
fact
that
the
servant
the
service
of
the
one
and
that
of
the
other
he
shall
the
one
and
reject
the
other
as
though
our
lord
had
said
no
one
can
become
the
servant
of
another
when
his
will
revolts
from
his
service
and
when
the
conditions
of
it
tend
to
make
him
hate
the
man
since
the
fact
that
the
servant
one
of
two
masters
makes
it
impossible
for
him
to
serve
if
he
spurned
it
would
make
it
impossible
for
him
to
serve
so
also
if
the
fact
that
an
individual
did
not
hold
to
or
choose
the
service
of
another
proves
that
he
could
not
become
his
servant
then
the
question
whether
or
not
he
should
become
the
servant
of
another
was
suspended
on
own
further
the
phraseology
of
the
passage
shows
that
the
of
the
servant
decided
the
question
he
will
hold
to
the
one
hence
there
is
no
difficulty
in
the
way
of
his
serving
but
no
servant
can
serve
a
master
whom
he
does
not
or
to
whose
service
he
does
not
this
is
the
sole
ground
of
the
impossibility
asserted
by
our
lord
the
last
clause
of
the
verse
furnishes
an
application
of
the
principle
asserted
in
the
former
part
ye
can
not
serve
god
and
mammon
now
in
what
does
the
impossibility
of
serving
both
god
and
the
world
consist
solely
in
the
fact
that
the
will
which
chooses
the
one
refuses
the
other
and
the
affections
which
hold
to
the
one
reject
the
other
thus
the
question
which
of
the
two
is
to
be
served
is
suspended
alone
upon
the
of
the
individual
xi
rich
strangers
did
not
become
servants
indeed
so
far
were
they
from
becoming
servants
themselves
that
they
bought
and
held
jewish
servants
lev
xxv
since
strangers
did
not
become
servants
to
the
israelites
we
infer
that
those
who
became
such
not
because
they
were
but
because
they
were

finally
in

the

servants
and
their
service
no
form
of
expression
is
employed
from

it
could
be

that

were
made
such
and
held
in
that
condition

force

to
this
the
entire
absence
of
all
the

incidents
of
voluntary
service
on
the

of
servants
would
have
been
in
keeping
with
regulations
which
abounded
in
the
mosaic
system
and
sustained
by
a
multitude
of
analogies
compulsory
service
on
the
other
hand
could
have
harmonized
with
nothing

would

solitary

we
should
naturally
infer
that
the
directions
which
regulated
the
rendering
of

individuals

upon
the

principle
in

which

the
voluntariness
of
servants
is
a
natural
inference
from
the
fact
that
the
hebrew
word
uniformly
rendered

applied
to
a
great
variety
of
classes
and
descriptions
of
persons
under

patriarchal

jewish
dispensations
of

voluntary

most
of
them
eminently
so

it
is
applied
to
persons

acts

about
seventy
times

it
is
applied
to
not
more
than
half
that
number
of
times

may
add
that
the
illustrations
drawn
from
the
condition

of
and
the
ideas
which
the
term
servant
is
employed
to
convey
when
applied
figuratively
to
moral
subjects
would
in
most
instances
lose
all
their
force
and
often
become
absurdities
if
the
will
of
the
servant
his

and
he
performed
it
only
by
many
passages
will
at

the
doctrine
plainly
inculcated
in
this
passage
is
that
every
man
labor
or
service
being
his
own
property
he
is
entitled
to
the
profit
of
it
and
that
for
another
to
use
it
without
paying
him
the
value
of
it
is
unrighteousness
the
last
clause
of
the
verse
and
giveth
him
not
for
his
work
reaffirms
the
same
principle
that
every
man
is
to
be
for
his
work
in
the
context
the
prophet
contrasts
the
unrighteousness
of
those
who
used
the
labor
of
others
without
pay
with
the
justice
and
equity
practiced
by
their
patriarchal
ancestor
toward
the
poor

thine
eyes

thine

thy

for
to
shed
innocent
blood

the
extent
of

a

reduced

sold

declared
that

may
be
either
by
his
kindred
or
by
himself
having
been
forced
to
sell
himself
from
poverty
he
must
have
acquired
considerable
property
he
became
a
servant

it
had
not
been
common
for
servants
to
acquire
property
over
which
they
had
the
control

hardly
have
ventured
to
take
a
large
sum

from
naaman

it
was
procured
by

he
wished
to
conceal
the
means
used
in
getting
it
but
if
servants
could
own
nothing
nor
acquire
anything
to
embark
in
such
an
enterprise
would
have
been
consummate
stupidity
the
fact
of
having
in
his
possession
two
talents
of
silver
would
of
itself
convict
him
of
theft
b
but
since
it
was
common
for
servants
to
own
property
he
might
have
it
and
invest
or
use
it
without
attracting
special
attention
and
that
consideration
alone
would
have
been
a
strong
motive
to
the
act

he
rebuked
him
for
using
such
means
to
get

merely
as

in

hence
the

virtually
saying

i

take

thus
adding
insult

the
promise
of
the
servant
to
pay
the
debt
on
condition
that
the
time
for
payment
should
be
postponed
not
only
proceeds
upon
the
fact
that
his
time
was
his
own
that
he
was
constantly
earning
property

circumstances

and
that
the

absolve

rather
would
always
such
obligations

the
relations

owner

creditor
in

would
annihilate

all

in

were
required
to

an
annual
tribute
to
the
government
the
israelites
might
often
buy
them
as
family
servants
by
stipulating
with
them
to
pay
their
annual
tribute
this
assumption
of
their
obligations
to
the
government
might
cover
the
whole
of
the
time
of
service

a
part

pleasure

if

received

it

equivalent

specific
precepts
of
the

enforcing
general
principles

we
select
the
following
thou
shalt
not

ox
when
he
treadeth
out
the
corn

here
is
a
general
principle
applied
to
a
familiar
case
the
ox
representing
all
domestic
animals
isa
xxx
a
kind
of
service
kinds
and
a
law
requiring
an
abundant
provision
for
the
wants
of
an
animal
ministering
to
man
in
a
way
a
general
principle
of
treatment
covering
all
times
modes
and
instrumentalities
of
service
the
object
of
the
law
was
not
merely
to
enjoin
tenderness
towards
brutes
but
to
inculcate
the
duty
of
rewarding
those
who
serve
us
and
if
such
care
be
enjoined
by
god
both
for
the
ample
sustenance
and
present
enjoyment
of
what
would
be
a
meet
return
for
the
services
of
man
with
his
varied
wants
exalted
nature
and
immortal
destiny
paul
says
expressly
that
this
principle
lies
at
the
bottom
of
the
statute
cor
ix
for
it
is
written
in
the
law
of
moses
thou
shalt
not
muzzle
the
mouth
of
the
ox
that
treadeth
out
the
corn
doth
god
take
care
for
oxen
or
saith
he
it
altogether
for
our
sakes
that
he
that
ploweth
should
plow
in
hope
and
that
he
that
thresheth
in
hope
should
be
partaker
of
his
hope
in
the
context
paul
innumerates
the
four
grand
divisions
of
labor
among
the
jews
in
illustration
of
the
principle
that
the
laborer
whatever
may
be
the
service
he
performs
is
entitled
to
a
the
priests
levites
and
all
engaged
in
sacred
things
the
military

who
tended
flocks
and
herds
and
those
who
cultivated
the
soil
as
the
latter
employment
engaged
the
great
body
of
the
israelites
the
apostle
amplifies
his
illustration
under
that
head
by
much
detail
and
enumerates
the
five
great
departments
of
agricultural
labor
among
the
jews
plowing
sowing
reaping
and
threshing
as
the
representatives
of
universal
labor
in
his
epistle
to
timothy
tim
paul
quotes
again
this
precept
of
the
mosaic
law
and
connects
with
it
the
declaration
of
our
lord
luke
x
the
laborer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
as
both
inculcating
the
doctrine
that
he
who
labors
whatever
the
employment
or
whoever
the
laborer
is
entitled
to
a
reward
the
apostle
thus
declares
the
principle
of
right
respecting
the
performance
of
service
for
others
and
the
rule
of
duty
towards
those
who
perform
it
to
be
the
same
under
both
dispensations
if
thy
brother
be
waxen
poor
and
fallen
in
decay
with
thee
then
thou
shalt
relieve
him
yea
though
he
be
a
stranger
or
a
sojourner
that
he
may
live
with
thee
take
thou
no
usury
of
him
or
increase
but
fear
thy
god
thou
shalt
not
give
him
thy
money
upon
usury
nor
lend
him
thy
victuals
for
increase
lev

now
we
ask
by
what
process
of
legerdemain
this
regulation
can
be
made
to
harmonize
with
the
doctrine
of
work
without
pay
did
god
declare
the
poor
stranger
entitled
to
relief
and
in
the
same
breath
authorize
them
to
use
his
service
without
wages
force
him
to
work

rob
him
of
his
earnings

objected
that

gave

enlarging

the
nature

polygamy
then
prevalent
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
handmaids
of
wives
were
regarded
as
wives
though
of
inferior
dignity
and
authority
that
jacob
so
regarded
his
handmaids
is
proved
by
his
curse
upon
reuben
xlix

chron
also
by
the
equality
of
their
children
with
those
of
rachel
and
leah
but
had
it
been
otherwise
had
laban
given
them
as
of
then
indeed
the
example
of
this
good
old
slaveholder
and
patriarch
saint
laban
would
have
been
a
forecloser
to
all
argument
ah
we
remember
his
jealousy
for
his
holy
indignation
when
he
found
that
his
gods
were
stolen
how
he
mustered
his
clan
and
plunged
over
the
desert
in
hot
pursuit
seven
days
by
forced
marches
how
he
ransacked
a
whole
caravan
sifting
the
contents
of
every
tent
little
heeding
such
small
matters
as
domestic
privacy
or
female
seclusion
for
lo
the
zeal
of
his
images
had
eaten
him
up
no
wonder
that
slavery
in
its
drifting
dismantled
before
the
free
gusts
should
scud
under
the
lee
of
such
a
pious
worthy
to
haul
up
and
refit
invoking
his
protection
and
the
benediction
of
his
gods
again
it
may
be
objected
that

were

in

it

in

the

make
the
doctrine
that
they
were
commodities
an
absurdity
as
the
head
of

jewish
family
possessed
the
same
power
over
his
wife
children
and
grandchildren
if
they
were
in
his
family
as
over
his
servants

the
latter
were
articles
of
property
the
former
were
equally
such

there
were

history
establishing
the
social
equality
of
the
servants
with
their
masters

precepts
which
required
that
they
should
be
guests
at
all
the
public
feasts

equal
participants
in

rejoicings
would

the
whole
transaction
was
a
formal
recognition
of
the
gibeonites
as
a
distinct
people
there
is
no
intimation
that
they
served
either
families
or
individuals
of
the
israelites
but
only
the
house
of
god
or
the
tabernacle
this
was
established
first
at
gilgal
a
days
journey
from
their
cities
and
then
at
shiloh
nearly
two
days
journey
from
them
where
it
continued
about
years
during
this
period
the
gibeonites
inhabited
their
ancient
cities
and
territory
only
a
few
comparatively
could
have
been
absent
at
any
one
time
in
attendance
on
the
tabernacle
wherever
allusion
is
made
to
them
in
the
history
the
main
body
are
spoken
of
as
it
is
preposterous
to
suppose
that
all
the
inhabitants
of
these
four
cities
could
find
employment
at
the
tabernacle
one
of
them
was
a
great
city
as
one
of
the
royal
cities
so
large
that
a
confederacy
of
five
kings
apparently
the
most
powerful
in
the
land
was
deemed
necessary
for
its
destruction
it
is
probable
that
the
men
were
divided
into
classes
ministering
in
rotation
each
class
a
few
days
or
weeks
at
a
time
as
the
priests
whose
assistants
they
were
served
by
courses
in
rotation
a
week
at
a
time
it
is
not
improbable
that
their
periods
of
service
were
so
arranged
as
to
correspond
this
service
was
their
to
the
israelites
for
the
privilege
of
residence
and
protection
under
their
government
no
service
seems
to
have
been
required
of
the
as
these
gibeonites
were
canaanites
and
as
they
had
greatly
exasperated
the
israelites
by
impudent
imposition
and
lying
we
might
assuredly
expect
that
they
would
reduce
to
the
condition
of
chattels
if
there
was
case
in
which
god
permitted
them
to
do
so

warns
the

against

by

in

judgments

their
hopes
in

to
all
within

repeated

have
been

from
those
parts
of
egypt
inhabited
by
the
egyptians
so
far
at
least
as
to
prevent
their

with
the
israelites
since
the
reason
assigned
for
locating
them
in

was
that
shepherds
were
an
abomination
to
the
egyptians
besides
their
employments

naturally

very

the

that

to

either
a
lamb
or
a
kid
one
year
old
for
the
passover
before
the
people
left
egypt
we
infer
that
even
the
poorest
of
the
israelites
owned
a
flock
either
of
sheep
or
goats
further
the
immense
multitude
of
their
flocks
and

may
be
judged
of
from

inferred

it

improbable
that
the
making

only
service
named
during
the

could
have
furnished
permanent
employment
for
the

of

also
ex

besides
when
eastern
nations
employed

it
was

requiring

to
furnish
a
given
quota
drafted
off

so
that
comparatively
but
a
small
portion
of
the
nation
would
be

adult
males
of
the
israelites
were
probably
divided
into
companies
which
relieved
each
other

stated
intervals
of
weeks

it
might
have
been
during
one
of
these
periodical
furloughs
from

that
aaron
performed
the

to

at
the
least
calculation
this
journey
must
have
consumed
probably
part
of
the
proceeds
of
their
labor

required
of
the
israelites
in
common
with
the
egyptians

instead
of
taking
it
from
their
goshen
being
better
for
they
exacted
it
of
them
in
brick
making
and
labor
might
have
been
exacted
only
from
the
israelites
the
wealthy
being
able
to
pay
their
tribute
in
money
the
fact
that
all
the
elders
of
israel
seem
to
have
controlled
their
own

abraham
receives

honor

not
because
he
was

father

forsook

most

nay
verily
for
all
this
he
gets
faint
praise
but
then
he
had

claims

are
lamentably
lost

of
it
is
quite
unaccountable
that
in
their
manifold
oglings
over
abraham
servants
bought
with
money
no
slaveholder
is
ever
caught
casting
loving
at
xxvii
where

addressing

says
be
over
thy

and
let
thy

sons

thee
and

immunities
confirmed

behold

made

all
his

have
i
given

here
is
a
charter
for
slaveholding
under
the
sign
manual
of
that
good
old
slaveholder
and
patriarch
isaac
yea
more
a
divine
warrant
for
a
father
holding
his
as
slaves
and
bequeathing
them
as
property
to
his
heirs
better
still
it
proves
that
the
favorite
practice
amongst
our
slaveholders
of
bequeathing
their
children
to
those
of
a
different
hue
was
a
divine
institution
for
isaac
esau
who
was
all
over
to
jacob
a
now
gentlemen
honor
to
whom
honor
let
isaac
no
longer
be
stinted
of
the
glory
that
is
his
due
as
the
great
prototype
of
that
peculiar
domestic
institution
of
which
you
are
eminent
patrons
that
nice
discrimination
by
which
a
father
in
his
will
makes
part
of
his
children
and
the
rest
their
whenever
the
propriety
of
such
a
disposition
is
indicated
as
in
the
case
of
jacob
and
esau
by
the
decisive
tokens
of
color
and
hair
for
to
show
that
esau
was
jacob
property
after
he
was
given
to
him
by
isaac
for
a
servant
the
difference
in
as
well
as
color
is
expressly
stated
by
inspiration
one
prominent
feature
of
patriarchal
example
has
been
quite
overlooked
by
slaveholders
we
mean
the
special
care
of
isaac
to
inform
jacob
that
those
given
to
him
as
servants
were
his
brethren
twice
repeated
the
deep
veneration
of
slaveholders
for
every
thing
patriarchal
clears
them
from
all
suspicion
of
neglecting
this
authoritative
precedent
and
their
admirable
zeal
to
perpetuate
patriarchal
fashions
proves
this
seeming
neglect
a
mere
and
is
an
guarantee
that
henceforward
they
will
religiously
illustrate
in
their
own
practice
the
beauty
of
this
hitherto
neglected
patriarchal
usage
true
it
would
be
an
odd
codicil
to
a
will
for
a
slaveholder
after
bequeathing
to
of
his
children
all
his
slaves
to
add
a
supplement
informing
them
that
such
and
such
and
such
of
them
were
their
and
doubtless
it
would
be
at
first
a
sore
trial
also
but
what
slaveholder
would
not
be
sustained
under
it
by
the
reflection
that
he
was
humbly
following
in
the
footsteps
of
his
illustrious
patriarchal
predecessors
great
reformers
must
make
great
sacrifices
and
if
the
world
is
to
be
brought
back
to
the
purity
of
patriarchal
times
upon
whom
will
the
ends
of
the
earth
come
to
whom
will
all
trembling
hearts
and
failing
eyes
spontaneously
turn
as
leaders
to
conduct
the
forlorn
hope
through
the
wilderness
to
that
promised
land
if
not
to
slaveholders
those
disinterested
pioneers
whose
labors
have
founded
far
and
wide
the
patriarchal
institution
of
and
through
evil
report
and
good
report
have
faithfully
stamped
their

this
prophecy

the
of

never
venture
abroad
without
it
it

a
for

occasion
a

dote
over

negro
slavery
by
the
curse
on
canaan
as
usual
all
the
points
in
debate
that
was
prophesied
rather
than
mere
to
others
and
bondage
rather
than
subjection
and
tribute
that
the
of
crime
justifies
it
or
at
least
absolves
those
whose
crimes
fulfil
it
how
piously
the
pharaohs
might
have
quoted
the
prophecy
seed
shall
be
a
stranger
in
a
land
that
is
not
theirs
and
they
shall
afflict
them
four
hundred
and
then
what
saints
were
those
that
crucified
the
lord
of
glory
that
the
africans
are
descended
from
canaan
africa
was
peopled
from
egypt
and
ethiopia
which
countries
were
settled
by
mizraim
and
cush
for
the
location
and
boundaries
of
canaan
posterity
see
x
so
a
prophecy
of
evil
to
one
people
is
quoted
to
justify
its
infliction
upon
another
perhaps
it
may
be
argued
that
canaan
includes
all
posterity
if
so
the
prophecy
is
yet
unfulfilled
the
other
sons
of
ham
settled
egypt
and
assyria
and
conjointly
with
shem
persia
and
afterward
to
some
extent
the
grecian
and
roman
empires
the
history
of
these
nations
gives
no
verification
of
the
prophecy
whereas
the
history
of
canaan
descendants
for
more
than
three
thousand
years
is
a
record
of
its
fulfillment
first
they
were
put
to
tribute
by
the
israelites
then
by
the
medes
and
persians
then
by
the
macedonians
grecians
and
romans
successively
and
finally
were
subjected
by
the
ottoman
dynasty
where
they
yet
remain
thus
canaan
has
been
for
ages
the
servant
mainly
of
shem
and
japhet
and
secondarily
of
the
other
sons
of
ham
it
may
still
be
objected
that
though
canaan
alone
is
yet
the
and
verses
show
the
posterity
of
ham
in
general
to
be
meant
and
ham
the
father
of
canaan
saw
the
nakedness
of
his
father
and
told
his
two
brethren
without
and
noah
awoke
from
his
wine
and
knew
what
his
younger
son
had
done
unto
him
and
said
it
is
argued
that
this
son
can
not
be
canaan
as
he
was
the
of
noah
and
therefore
it
must
be
ham
we
answer
whoever
that
was
canaan
alone
was
named
in
the
curse

the

it
be
said
that

varies

the

is
that

the

if

even

that

further
the
word
here
rendered
occurs
times
in
the
old
testament
and
in
almost
every
place
is
translated
in
a
few
take
or
and
in
this
instance
alone
as
it
stands
in
our
translation
the
pronoun
preceding
it
refers
to
the
whereas
it
should
refer
to
the

the
word
rendered
should
have
been

the
meaning
is
this

a
man
smite
his

or
his
maid
with
a
rod
and
he
die
under
his
hand
it
the

or
literally
avenging
it
shall
be
that

the
of

shall
be
by
the
of
the
master
so
in
the
next
verse
if
he
continue
a
day
or

his
death
is
not
to
be
avenged
by
the
of
the
as
in
that
case
the
crime
was
to
be
adjudged
and
not
in
the
following
verse
another
case
of
personal
injury
is
stated
for
which
the
injurer
is
to
pay
sum
of
and
yet
our
translators
employ
the
same
phraseology
in
both
places
one
an
instance
of
deliberate
wanton
killing
by
piecemeal
the
other
an
accidental
and
comparatively
slight
injury
of
the
inflicter
in
both
cases
they
say
the
same
thing
now
just
the
discrimination
to
be
looked
for
where
god
legislates
is
marked
in
the
original
in
the
case
of
the
servant
wilfully
murdered
he
says
it
the
death
shall
surely
be
that
is
the
life
of
the
wrong
doer
shall
expiate
the
crime

same
word
is
used
in
the
old
testament
when
the
greatest
wrongs
are
redressed
by
devoting
the
perpetrators
to
in
the
case
of
the
unintentional
injury
in
the
following
verse
god
says
he
shall
surely
be
he
shall
as
the
judges
determine
the
simple
meaning
of
the
word
is
to
lay
a
fine
it
is
used
in
deut

they
shall

one

shekels

in

condemned
the
land
in
a
hundred
talents
of
silver
and
a
talent
of
gold
that
the
death
of
the
servant
was
neither
imprisonment
nor
stripes
nor
a
fine
but
that
it
was
the
master

the
clause
for
he

quoted
to
prove
that
the
servant
is
his
property
and
therefore
if

died
the
master

not

the
assumption

that

the

admits
that
in

is
to

punished
for
destroying

other
inference
is
that
since
the
continuance
of
a
day
or

cleared
the
master
of
to
the
loss
of
the
servant
would
be
a
sufficient
punishment
for
inflicting
the
injury

caused
his

to
designate
those
who
perform
service
for
or
about
times
in
the
old
testament
to
designate
about
times
to
designate
the
of
about
times
to
designate
the
worshippers
both
of
the
true
god
and
of
false
gods
about
seventy
times
it
is
also
used
in
salutations
and
courteous
addresses
nearly
one
hundred
times
in
fine
the
word
is
applied
to
all
persons
doing
service
for
others
and
that
to
designate
them
as
the
performers
of
such
whatever
it
might
be
or
whatever
the
ground
on
which
it
might
be
rendered
to
argue
from
the
fact
of
this
word
being
used
to
designate
domestic
servants
that
they
were
made
servants
by
worked
without
pay
and
held
as
articles
of
property
is
such
a
gross
assumption
and
absurdity
as
to
make
formal
refutation
ridiculous
we
repeat
what
has
been
shown
above
that
the
word
rendered
bondmen
in
lev
xxv
is
used
to
point
out
persons
rendering
service
for
others
totally
irrespective
of
the
principle
on
which
that
service
was
rendered
as
is
manifest
from
the
fact
that
it
is
applied
indiscriminately
to
tributaries
to
domestics
to
all
the
subjects
of
governments
to
magistrates
to
all
governmental
officers
to
younger
sons
defining
their
relation
to
the
first
born
who
is
called
and
to
prophets
to
kings
and
to
the
messiah
to
argue
from
the
meaning
of
the
word
as
used
in
the
old
testament
that
those
to
whom
it
was
applied
rendered
service
against
their
will
and
without
pay
does
violence
to
the
scripture
use
of
the
term
sets
at
nought
all
rules
of
interpretation
and
outrages
common
sense
if
inference
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
term
is
to
be
drawn
from
the
condition
and
relations
of
the
various
classes
of
persons
to
whom
it
is
applied
the
only
legitimate
one
would
seem
to
be
that
the
term
designates
a
person
who
renders
service
to
another
in
return
for
something
of
value
received
from
him
the
same
remark
applies
to
the
hebrew
verb
to
serve
answering
to
the
noun
servant
it
is
used
in
the
old
testament
to
describe
the
of
tributaries
of
worshippers
of
domestics
of
levites
of
sons
to
a
father
of
younger
brothers
to
the
elder
of
subjects
to
a
ruler
of
hirelings
of
soldiers
of
public
officers
to
the
government
of
a
host
to
his
guests
of
these
it
is
used
to
describe
the
serving
of
more
than
forty
times
of
about
thirty
five
and
of
servants
or
domestics
about
if
the
israelites
not
only
held
slaves
but
multitudes
of
them
if
abraham
had
thousands
and
if
they
abounded
under
the
mosaic
system
why
had
their
language
no
word
that
that
language
must
be
wofully
which
has
no
signs
to
represent
the
most
common
and
familiar
objects
and
conditions
to
represent
by
the
same
word
and
without
figure
property
and
the
owner
of
that
property

in
our
language
we
have
both
and
why
because
we
have
both
the
and
need
for
them
if
the
tongue
had
a
sheath
as
swords
have
scabbards
we
should
have
some
for
it
but
our
dictionaries
give
us
none
why
because
there
is
no
such
but
the
objector
asks
would
not
the
israelites
use
their
word
if
they
spoke
of
the
slave
of
a
heathen
answer
their
servants
or
tributaries
are
spoken
of
frequently
but
domestics
servants
so
rarely
that
no
necessity
existed
even
if
they
were
slaves
for
coining
a
new
word
besides
the
fact
of
their
being
domestics
under
laws
and
proclaimed
their
liabilities
their
made
a
term
unnecessary
but
if
the
israelites
had
not
only
but
a
multitude
of
a
meaning
would
have
been
indispensible
for
every
day
convenience
further
the
laws
of
the
mosaic
system
were
so
many
sentinels
on
the
outposts
to
warn
off
foreign
practices
the
border
ground
of
canaan
was
quarantine
ground
enforcing
the
strictest
in
usages
between
the
without
and
the
within
buy
the
of
servants
is
discussed
at
length
pp
to
that
discussion
the
reader
is
referred
we
will
add
in
this
place
but
a
single
consideration
this
regulation
requiring
the
israelites
to
buy
servants
of
the
heathen
prohibited
their
taking
them
without
buying
supposes
two
parties
a
demanded
by
one
and
paid
by
the
other
and
consequently
the
of
both
buyer
and
seller
to
the
transaction
of
course
the
command
to
the
israelites
to
servants
of
the
heathen
prohibited
their
getting
them
unless
they
first
got
consent
to
the
transaction
and
paid
to
a
fair
equivalent
now
who
were
these
this
at
least
is
plain
they
were
not
but
heathen
of
shall
ye
buy
who
then
were
these
whose
right
was
so
paramount
that
consent
must
be
got
and
the
price
paid
must
go
into
pockets
were
they
the
persons
themselves
who
became
servants
or
some
persons
some
persons
to
be
sure
says
the
objector
the
countrymen
or
the
neighbors
of
those
who
become
servants
ah
this
then
is
the
import
of
the
divine
command
to
the
israelites
when
you
go
among
the
heathen
round
about
to
get
a
man
to
work
for
you
i
straightly
charge
you
to
go
first
to
his
get
consent
that
you
may
have
him
settle
the
terms
with
and
pay
to
them
a
fair
equivalent
if
it
is
not
choice
to
let
him
go
i
charge
you
not
to
take
him
on
your
peril
if
consent
and
you
pay
the
full
value
of
his
labor
then
you
may
go
and
catch
the
man
and
drag
him
home
with
you
and
make
him
work
for
you
and
i
will
bless
you
in
the
work
of
your
hands
and
you
shall
eat
of
the
fat
of
the
land
as
to
the
man
himself
his
choice
is
nothing
and
you
need
give
him
nothing
for
his
work
but
take
care
and
pay
his
well
for
him
and
respect
free
choice
in
taking
him
for
to
deprive
a
heathen
man
by
force
and
without
pay
of
the
of
is
well
pleasing
in
my
sight
but
to
deprive
his
heathen
neighbors
of
the
use
of
him
is
that
abominable
thing
which
my
soul
hateth
forever
this
is
quoted
to
prove
that
servants
were
to
serve
during
their
life
time
and
their
posterity
from
generation
to
generation
a
no
such
idea
is
contained
in
the
passage
the
word
forever
instead
of
defining
the
length
of
service
proclaims
the
permanence
of
the
regulation
laid
down
in
the
two
verses
preceding
namely
that
their
should
be
of
the
and
not
of
the
israelites
it
declares
the
duration
of
that
general
provision
as
if
god
had
said
you
shall
get
your
laborers
from
the
nations
round
about
you
your
servants
shall
be
of
that
class
of
persons
as
it
stands
in
the
original
it
is
plain
of
them
shall
ye
serve
this
is
the
literal
rendering
footnote
a
one
would
think
that
the
explicit
testimony
of
our
lord
should
for
ever
forestall
all
cavil
on
this
point

in

that
refers
to
the
permanent
relations
of
a
rather
than
to
the
services
of

a
fair
inference
from
the
form
of
the
expression
both
thy
bondmen
shall
be
of
the
of
them
shall
ye
buy
they
shall
be
your

over
your
brethren
the
children
of
israel
to
say
nothing
of
the
uncertainty
of
surviving
those
whom
they
are
to
live
the
language
used
applies
more
naturally
to
a
of
people
than
to
servants
besides
service
can
not
be
argued
from
the
term
the
ninth
and
tenth
verses
of
the
same
chapter
limit
it
absolutely
by
the
jubilee
then
thou
shalt
cause
the
trumpet
of
the
jubilee
to
sound
throughout
all
your
land
and
ye
shall
proclaim
liberty
throughout
all
the
land
unto
all
the
inhabitants
thereof
it
may
be
objected
that
inhabitants
here
means
inhabitants
alone
the
command
is
proclaim
liberty
throughout
all
the
land
unto
all
inhabitants
besides
in
the
sixth
verse
there
is
an
enumeration
of
the
different
classes
of
the
inhabitants
in
which
servants
and
strangers
are
included
and
in
all
the
regulations
of
the
jubilee
and
the
sabbatical
year
the
strangers
are
included
in
the
precepts
prohibitions
and
promises
again
the
year
of
jubilee
was
ushered
in
by
the
day
of
atonement
what
did
these
institutions
show
forth
the
day
of
atonement
prefigured
the
atonement
of
christ
and
the
year
of
jubilee
the
gospel
jubilee
and
did
they
prefigure
an
atonement
and
a
jubilee
to
only
were
they
types
of
sins
remitted
and
of
salvation
proclaimed
to
the
nation
of
israel
alone
is
there
no
redemption
for
us
gentiles
in
these
ends
of
the
earth
and
is
our
hope
presumption
and
impiety
did
that
old
partition
wall
survive
the
shock
that
made
earth
quake
and
hid
the
sun
burst
graves
and
rocks
and
rent
the
temple
veil
and
did
the
gospel
only
rear
it
higher
to
thunder
direr
perdition
from
its
frowning
battlements
on
all
without
no
the
god
of
our
salvation
lives
good
tidings
of
great
joy
shall
be
to
all
people
one
shout
shall
swell
from
all
the
ransomed
thou
hast
redeemed
us
unto
god
by
thy
blood
out
of
every
kindred
and
tongue
and
people
and
nation
to
deny
that
the
blessings
of
the
jubilee
extended
to
the
servants
from
the
makes
christianity
a
it
not
only
eclipses
the
glory
of
the
gospel
but
strikes
out
its
sun
the
refusal
to
release
servants
at
the
jubilee
falsified
and
disannulled
a
grand
leading
type
of
the
atonement
and
was
a
libel
on
the
doctrine
of
redemption
but
even
if
did
refer
to
service
we
have
ample
precedents
for
limiting
the
term
by
the
jubilee
the
same
word
defines
the
length
of
time
which
servants
served
who
did
not
go
out
at
the
end
of
their
six
years
term
and
all
admit
that
they
went
out
at
the
jubilee
ex
xxi
deut
xv
the
verse
of
the
same
chapter
is
quoted
to
prove
that
in
the
verse
extends
beyond
the
jubilee
the
land
shall
not
be
sold
forever
for
the
land
is
mine
since
it
would
hardly
be
used
in
different
senses
in
the
same
general
connection
as
in
the
verse
respects
the
and
not
the
objection
does
not
touch
the
argument
besides
in
the
verse
the
word
used
is
meaning
the
whatever
that
may
be
whereas
in
the
verse
it
is
meaning
a
or
be
cut
and
the
import
of
it
is
that
the
owner
of
an
inheritance
shall
not
forfeit
his
of
it
though
it
may
for
a
time
pass
from
his
control
into
the
hands
of
his
creditors
or
others
yet
the
owner
shall
be
permitted
to
it
and
even
if
that
be
not
done
it
shall
not
be
but
shall
revert
to
him

jubilee
footnote
a
so
far
from
the

not
being
released
by
the
proclamation
of
liberty
on
the
morning
of

a

brief
considerations
we

that

that

all

reservations

to

of

has
been
already
discussed
pp
we
need
add
in
this
place
but
a
word
as
an
illustration
of
the
condition
of
servants
from
the
heathen
that
were
the
possession
of
israelitish
families
and
of
the
way
in
which
they
became
servants
the
reader
is
referred
to
isa
xiv
for
the
lord
will
have
mercy
on
jacob
and
will
yet
choose
israel
and
set
them
in
their
own
land

the

will
be
with
them
and
shall
cleave
to

the

them
in

for
servants
and
handmaids
and
they
shall
take
them
captives
whose
captives
they
were
and
they
shall
rule
over
the
oppressors
we
learn
from
these
verses
that
these
servants
which
were
to
be
by
the
israelites
were
to
be
joined
with
them
become
proselytes
to
their
religion
that
they
should
cleave
to
the
house
of
jacob
that
they
would
forsake
their
own
people
voluntarily
attach
themselves
to
the
israelites
as
servants
and
of
their
own
free
choice
leave
home
and
friends
to
accompany
them
on
their
return
and
to
take
up
their
permanent
abode
with
them
in
the
same
manner
that
ruth
accompanied
naomi
from
moab
to
the
land
of
israel
and
that
the
souls
gotten
by
abraham
in
padanaram
accompanied
him
when
he
left
it
and
went
to
canaan

the
house
of

them
for

shall
them
for

the
passage
under
consideration
they

your
the
original
word
translated
possession

the
same
word

used
in

his

his

the
of

israelites
answer
in
the
sense
of
it
to
live
not
in
the
sense
of
having
it
as
in
what
sense
were
the
israelites
to
these
nations
and
as
an
for
their
answer
they
possessed
them
as
a
permanent
source
of
supply
for
domestic
or
household
servants
and
this
relation
to
these
nations
was
to
go
down
to
posterity
as
a
standing
regulation
having
the
certainty
and
regularity
of
a
descent
by
inheritance

of
the
whole
regulation

the

at

the
testimony
that
the

were
prohibited

in

as
only

it
is
inferred
that
servants
of
the
other
class
were
for
their
labor
that
god
while
thundering
anathemas
against
those
who
used
their
neighbor
service
without
wages
granted
a
special
indulgence
to
his
chosen
people
to
force
others
to
work
and
rob
them
of
earnings
provided
always
in
selecting
their
victims
they
spared
the
gentlemen
of
property
and
standing
and
pounced
only
upon
the
strangers
and
the
common
people
the
inference
that
is
synonymous
with
and
that
those
servants
not
hired
were
for
their
labor
is
a
mere
assumption
the
meaning
of
the
english
verb
to
is
to
procure
for
a
use
at
a
certain
price
to
engage
a
person
to
temporary
service
for

that
is
also
the
meaning
of
the
hebrew
word
it
is
not
used
when
the
procurement
of
service
is
spoken
of
now
we
ask
would
servants
those
who
constituted
a
stationary
part
of
the
family
have
been
designated
by
the
same
term
that
marks
servants
the
distinctions
in
this
matter
are
familiar
as
in
many
families
the
domestics
perform
only
the
work
whatever
is
occasional
merely
as
the
washing
of
a
family
is
done
by
persons
hired
expressly
for
the
purpose
the
familiar
distinction
between
the
two
classes
is
servants
and
hired
help
not

classes
are
one
is
permanent
and
the
other
occasional

in

humility
sinks
of
its
own
weight
and
in
the
lowest
deep

the
design
of
the
parable
was
to
illustrate
on
the
one
hand
the
joy
of
god
as
he
beholds
afar
off
the
returning
sinner
seeking
an
injured
face
who
runs
to
clasp
and
bless
him
with
an
unchiding
welcome

on
the
other
the

the
supposition
that
servants
were
the
class
takes
from
the
parable
an
element
of
winning
beauty
and
pathos
it
is
manifest
to
every
careful
student
of
the
bible
that
class
of
servants
was
on
terms
of
equality
with
the
children
and
other
members
of
the

the

nothing

though
he
be
lord
of
all
if
this
were
the
class
the
prodigal
was
a
sorry
specimen
of
humility
would
our
lord
have
put
such
language
upon
the
lips
of
one
held
up
by
himself
as
a
model
of
gospel
humility
to
illustrate
its
deep
sense
of
all

this

it
on
stilts

set
it

strutting

and
blunders

israelites
and
strangers
belonged
indiscriminately
to
class
of
the
servants
the
and
the
that
those
in
the
former
class
whether
jews
or
strangers
rose
to
honors
and
authority
in
the
family
circle
which
were
not
conferred
on
servants
has
been
shown
it
should
be
added
however
that
in
the
enjoyment
of
privileges
merely
the
hired
servants
from
the
were
more
favored
than
even
the
bought
servants
from
the
no
one
from
the
strangers
however
wealthy
or
highly
endowed
was
eligible
to
the
highest
office
nor
could
he
own
the
soil
this
last
disability
seems
to
have
been
one
reason
for
the
different
periods
of
service
required
of
the
two
classes
of
bought
servants
the
israelite
was
to
serve
six
years
the
stranger
until
the
jubilee
as
the
strangers
could
not
own
the
soil
nor
houses
except
within
walled
towns
they
would
naturally
attach
themselves
to
israelitish
families
those
who
were
wealthy
or
skilled
in
manufactures
instead
of
becoming
servants
would
need
servants
for
their
own
use
and
as
inducements
for
the
strangers
to
become
servants
to
the
israelites
were
greater
than
persons
of
their
own
nation
could
hold
out
to
them
these
wealthy
strangers
would
naturally
procure
the
poorer
israelites
for
servants
lev
xxv
in
a
word
such
was
the
political
condition
of
the
strangers
that
the
jewish
polity
offered
a
virtual
bounty
to
such
as
would
become
permanent
servants
and
thus
secure
those
privileges
already
enumerated
and
for
their
children
in
the
second
generation
a
permanent
inheritance

none
but
the
monied
aristocracy
would
be
likely
to
decline
such
offers
on
the
other
hand
the
israelites
owning
all
the
soil
and
an
inheritance
of
land
being
a
sacred
possession
to
hold
it
free
of
incumbrance
was
with
every
israelite
a
delicate
point
both
of
family
honor
and
personal
character
kings
xxi
hence
to
forego
the
control
of
one
inheritance
after
the
division
of
the
paternal
domain
or
to
be
kept
out
of
it
after
having
acceded
to
it
was
a
burden
grievous
to
be
borne
to
mitigate
as
much
as
possible
such
a
calamity
the
law
released
the
israelitish
servant
at
the
end
of
six
a
years
as
during
that
time
if
of
the
first
class
the
partition
of
the
patrimonial
land
might
have
taken
place
or
if
of
the
second
enough
money
might
have
been
earned
to
disencumber
his
estate
and
thus
he
might
assume
his
station
as
a
lord
of
the
soil
if
neither
contingency
had
occurred
then
after
another
six
years
the
opportunity
was
again
offered
and
so
on
until
the
jubilee
so
while
strong
motives
urged
the
israelite
to
discontinue
his
service
as
soon
as
the
exigency
had
passed
which
made
him
a
servant
every
consideration
impelled
the
to
his
term
of
service
b
and
the
same
kindness
which
dictated
the
law
of
six
years
service
for
the
israelite
assigned
as
the
general
rule
a
much
longer
period
to
the
gentile
servant
who
had
every
inducement
to
protract
the
term
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
adult
jews
ordinarily
became
servants
only
as
a
temporary
expedient
to
relieve
themselves
from
embarrassment
and
ceased
to
be
such
when
that
object
was
effected
the
poverty
that
forced
them
to
it
was
a
calamity
and
their
service
was
either
a
means
of
relief
or
a
measure
of
prevention
not
pursued
as
a
permanent
business
but
resorted
to
on
emergencies
a
sort
of
episode
in
the
main
scope
of
their
lives
whereas
with
the
stranger
it
was
a
pursued
both
as
a
of
bettering
their
own
condition
and
that
of
their
posterity
and
as
an
for
its
own
sake
conferring
on
them
privileges
and
a
social
estimation
not
otherwise
attainable
footnote
a
another
reason
for
protracting
the
service
until
the
seventh
year
seems
to
have

this
even
though
they

substantially
may
be
said
of

though
he
was
not
the
owner
of
the
land
which
he
cultivated
and
of
course
had
not
the
control
of
an
inheritance
yet
he
was
not
in
a

subjection
to

he
tilled
or
that
demanded
the
surrender
of

exacted
from

homage

stamped

be

of
inferiority

attach

were
not
subject
to
the
authority
of
their
masters
in
any
such
sense
as
the
master

children
and
bought
servants
hence
the
only
form
of
oppressing
hired
servants
spoken
of
in
the
scriptures
as
practicable
to
masters
is
that
of
back
their
to
have
taken
away
such
privileges
in
the
case
under
consideration
would
have
been
for
it
was
not
a
servant
born
in
the
house
of
a
master
nor
a
minor
whose
minority
had
been
sold
by
the
father
neither
was
it
one
who
had
not
yet
acceded
to
his
inheritance
nor
finally
one
who
had
received
the
of
his
inheritance
but
was
working
off
from
it
an
incumbrance
before
entering
upon
its
possession
and
control
but
it
was
that
of
head
of
a
who
had
known
better
days
now
reduced
to
poverty
forced
to
relinquish
the
loved
inheritance
of
his
fathers
with
the
competence
and
respectful
consideration
its
possession
secured
to
him
and
to
be
indebted
to
a
neighbor
for
shelter
sustenance
and
employment
so
sad
a
reverse
might
well
claim
sympathy
but
one
consolation
cheers
him
in
the
house
of
his
pilgrimage
he
is
an
abraham
is
his
and
now
in
his
calamity
he
clings
closer
than
ever
to
the
distinction
conferred
by
his
to
rob
him
of
this
were
the
unkindest
cut
of
all
to
have
assigned
him
to
a
grade
of
service
filled
only
by
those
whose
permanent
business
was
serving
would
have
been
to
rule
over
him
with
peculiar
rigor
thou
shalt
not
compel
him
to
serve
as
a
or
literally
shalt
not
serve
thyself

a
kind
and
grade
of

character
and
relations

be

to
him
his
family
organization

respect
and
authority
due
to
its
head
and
the
general
consideration
resulting
from
such
a
station
being
already
in
possession
of
his
inheritance
and
the
head
of
a
household

law
so
arranged
the
conditions
of
his
service
as
to
as
much
as
possible
the
calamity
which
had
reduced
him
from
independence
and
authority
to
penury
and
subjection
the
import
of
the
command
which
concludes
this
topic
in
the
verse
thou
shalt
not
rule
over
him
with
rigor
is
manifestly
this
you
shall
not
disregard
those
differences
in
previous
associations
station
authority
and
political
privileges
upon
which
this
regulation
is
based
for
to
hold
this
class
of
servants
of
these
distinctions
and
annihilating
them
is
to
rule
with
rigor
the
same
command
is
repeated
in
the
verse
and
applied
to
the
distinction
between
servants
of
jewish
and
those
of
gentile
extraction
and
forbids
the
overlooking
of
distinctive
jewish
peculiarities
the
disregard
of
which
would
be
in
the
extreme
e
the
construction
commonly
put
upon
the
phrase
rule
with
rigor
and
the
inference
drawn
from
it
have
an
air
vastly
oracular
it
is
interpreted
to
mean
you
shall
not
make
him
a
chattel
and
strip
him
of
legal
protection
nor
force
him
to
work
without
pay
the
inference
is
like
unto
it
since
the
command
forbade
such
outrages
upon
the
israelites
it
permitted
and
commissioned
their
infliction
upon
the
strangers
such
impious
and
shallow
smattering
captivates
scoffers
and
libertines
its
flippancy
and
blasphemy
and
the
strong
scent
of
its
license

a
charm

them
what
boots
it

reason
against

rampant
affinities

the
of
the
exaction
the
expression

with
rigor
is
never
applied
to
the
service
of
servants
under
the
mosaic
system
the
phrase
thou
shall
not
rule
over
him
with
rigor
does
not
prohibit
unreasonable
exactions
of
labor
nor
inflictions
of
cruelty
such
were
provided
against
otherwise
but
it
forbids
confounding
the
distinctions
between
a
jew
and
a
stranger
by
assigning
the
former
to
the
same
grade
of
service
for
the

term

time

political
disabilities

modifications
peculiar
to
each

possession
of

classes
of

an
absolute
equality

were
equally

were

all
were

none

were
regarded
as
with
the
rights
interests
hopes
and
destinies
of
in
all
these
respects
classes
of
servants
among
the
israelites
formed
but
one
class
the
classes
and
the
differences
in
class
were
this
class
consisted
both
of
israelites
and
strangers
their
employments
were
different
the
was
an
agricultural
servant
the
stranger
was
a
and
servant
and
in
some
instances
both
were
occasional
and
temporary
both
lived
in
their
own
families
their
wages
were
and
they
were
paid
when
their
work
was
done
including
those
born
in
the
house
this
class
also
consisted
of
israelites
and
strangers
the
same
difference
in
their
kinds
of
employment
as
noticed
before
both
were
paid
in
advance
a
and
neither
was
temporary
the
israelitish
servant
with
the
exception
of
the
completed
his
term
in
six
years
the
stranger
was
a
permanent
servant
continuing
until
the
jubilee
a
marked
distinction
obtained
also
between
different
classes
of
bought
servants
ordinarily
they
were
merged
in
their
master
family
and
like
his
wife
and
children
subject
to
his
authority
and
like
them
protected
by
law
from
its
abuse
but
the
was
an
exception
his
family
relations
and
authority
remained
unaffected
nor
was
he
subjected
as
an
inferior
to
the
control
of
his
master
though
dependent
on
him
for
employment
footnote
a
the
payment
doubtless
lessened
the
price
of
the
purchase
the
servant
thus
having
the
use
of
the
money
and

master
assuming
all
the
risks
of
life
and
health
for
labor
at
the
expiration
of
the
six
years
contract
the
master
having
suffered
no
loss
from
the
risk
incurred
at
the
making
of
it
was
obliged
by
law
to
release
the
servant
with
a
liberal
gratuity
the
reason
assigned
for
this
is
he
hath
been
worth
a
double
hired
servant
unto
thee
in
serving
thee
six
years
as
if
it
had
been
said
as
you
have
experienced
no
loss
from
the
risks
of
life
and
ability
to
labor
incurred
in
the
purchase
and
which
lessened
the
price
and
as
by
being
your
servant
for
six
years
he
has
saved
you
the
time
and
trouble
of
looking
up
and
hiring
laborers
on
emergencies
therefore
thou
shalt
furnish
him
liberally
this
gratuity
at
the
close
of
the
service
shews
the
of
the
relation
for
value
it
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
classes
of
servants
the
israelite
and
the
stranger
not
only
enjoyed
natural
and
religious
but
the
civil
and
political
enjoyed
by
those
of
their
own
people
who
were
servants
they
also
shared
in
common
with
them
the
political
disabilities
which
appertained
to
all
strangers
whether
servants
of
jewish
masters
or
masters
of
jewish
servants
further
the
disabilities
of
the
servants
from
the
strangers
were
exclusively
and
they
in
common
with
all
strangers
could
not
own
the
soil
they
were
ineligible
to
civil
offices
they
were
assigned
to
employments
less
honorable
than
those
in
which
israelitish
servants
engaged
agriculture
being
regarded
as
fundamental
to
the
existence
of
the
state
other
employments
were
in
less
repute
and
deemed
finally
the
strangers
whether
servants
or
masters
were
all
protected
equally
with
the
descendants
of
abraham
in
respect
to
political
privileges
their
condition
was
much
like
that
of
unnaturalized
foreigners
in
the
united
states
whatever
their
wealth
or
intelligence
or
moral
principle
or
love
for
our
institutions
they
can
neither
go
to
the
nor
own
the
soil
nor
be
eligible
to
office
let
a
native
american
be
suddenly
bereft
of
these
privileges
and
loaded
with
the
disabilities
of
an
alien
and
what
to
the
foreigner
would
be
a
light
matter
to
would
be
the
severity
of
the
recent
condition

and
become
incorporated
with
the
israelites
by
family
alliance
the
regulation
laid
down
in
ex
xxi
is
an
illustration
in
this
case
the
israelitish
servant
whose
term
expired
in
six
years
married
one
of
his
master
female
but
her
marriage
did
not
release
her
master
from
part
of
the
contract
for
her
whole
term
of
service
nor
from
his
legal
obligation
to
support
and
educate
her
children
neither
did
it
do
away
that
distinction
which
marked
her
national
descent
by
a
specific
and
of
service
nor
impair
her
obligation
to
fulfil
part
of
the
contract
her
relations
as
a
permanent
domestic
grew
out
of
a
distinction
guarded
with
great
care
throughout
the
mosaic
system
to
render
it
void
would
have
been
to
divide
the
system
against
itself
this
god
would
not
tolerate
nor
on
the
other
hand
would
he
permit
the
master
to
throw
off
the
responsibility
of
instructing
her
children
nor
the
care
and
expense
of
their
helpless
infancy
and
rearing
he
was
bound
to
support
and
educate
them
and
all
her
children
born
afterwards
during
her
term
of
service
the
whole
arrangement
beautifully
illustrates
that
wise
and
tender
regard
for
the
interests
of
all
the
parties
concerned
which
arrays
the
mosaic
system
in
robes
of
glory
and
causes
it
to
shine
as
the
sun
in
the
kingdom
of
our
father
b
by
this
law
the
children
had
secured
to
them
a
mother
tender
care
if
the
husband
loved
his
wife
and
children
he
could
compel
his
master
to
keep
him
whether
he
had
any
occasion
for
his
services
or
not
if
he
did
not
love
them
to
be
rid
of
him
was
a
blessing
and
in
that
case
the
regulation
would
prove
an
act
for
the
relief
of
an
afflicted
family
it
is
not
by
any
means
to
be
inferred
that
the
release
of
the
servant
in
the
seventh
year
either
absolved
him
from
the
obligations
of
marriage
or
shut
him
out
from
the
society
of
his
family
he
could
doubtless
procure
a
service
at
no
great
distance
from
them
and
might
often
do
it
to
get
higher
wages
or
a
kind
of
employment
better
suited
to
his
taste
and
skill
the
great
number
of
days
on
which
the
law
released
servants
from
regular
labor
would
enable
him
to
spend
much
more
time
with
his
family
than
can
be
spent
by
most
of
the
agents
of
our
benevolent
societies
with
families
or
by
many
merchants
editors
artists
whose
daily
business
is
in
new
york
while
their
families
reside

one

whoever
profoundly
studies
the
mosaic
institutes
with
a
teachable
and
reverential
spirit
will
feel
the
truth
and
power
of
that
solemn
appeal
and
interrogatory
of
god
to
his
people
israel
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
setting
before
them
all
his
statutes
and
ordinances
what
nation
is
there
so
great
that
hath
statutes
and
judgments
so
righteous
as
this
law
which
i
set
before
you
this

deut
iv
we
conclude
this
inquiry
by
touching
upon
an
objection
which
though
not
formally
stated
has
been
already
set
aside
by
the
tenor
of
the
foregoing
argument
it
is
this
the
slavery
of
the
canaanites
by
the
israelites
was
appointed
by
god
as
a
commutation
of
the
punishment
of
death
denounced
against
them
for
their
sins
a
if
the
absurdity
of
a
sentence
consigning
persons
to
death
and
at
the
same
time
to
perpetual
slavery
did
not
sufficiently
laugh
at
itself
it
would
be
small
in
a
case
so
tempting
to
make
up
the
deficiency
by
a
general
contribution
only
statute
was
ever
given
respecting
the
disposition
to
be
made
of
the
inhabitants
of
canaan
if
the
sentence
of
death
was
pronounced
against
them
and
afterwards
when
where
by
whom
and
in
what
terms
was
the
commutation
and
where
is
it
recorded
grant
for
argument
sake
that
all
the
canaanites
were
sentenced
to
unconditional
extermination
how
can
a
right
to
them
be
drawn
from
such
premises
the
punishment
of
death
is
one
of
the
highest
recognitions
of
man
moral
nature
possible
it
proclaims
him
rational
accountable
guilty
deserving
death
for
having
done
his
utmost
to
cheapen
human
life
when
the
proof
of
its
priceless
worth
lived
in
his
own
nature
but
to
make
him
a
cheapens
to
nothing
human
and
instead
of
healing
a
wound
gives
a
what
repair
an
injury
to
rational
being
in
the
robbery
of
one
of
its
rights
not
only
by
robbing
it
of
all
but
by
annihilating
their
the
everlasting
distinction
between
persons
and
things
to
make
a
man
a
chattel
is
not
the
but
the
of
a
being
and
so
far
as
it
goes
of
human
beings
this
commutation
of
the
punishment
of
death
into
perpetual
slavery
what
a
fortunate
discovery
alas
for
the
honor
of
deity
if
commentators
had
not
manned
the
forlorn
hope
and
by
a
timely
movement
rescued
the
divine
character
at
the
very
crisis
of
its
fate
from
the
perilous
position
in
which
inspiration
had
carelessly
left
it
here
a
question
arises
of
sufficient
importance
for
a
separate
dissertation
but
must
for
the
present
be
disposed
of
in
a
few
paragraphs
were
the
canaanites
sentenced
by
god
to
individual
and
unconditional
extermination
as
the
limits
of
this
inquiry
forbid
our
giving
all
the
grounds
of
dissent
from
commonly
received
opinions
the
suggestions
made
will
be
thrown
out
merely
as
queries
rather
than
laid
down
as
the
directions
as
to
the
disposal
of
the
canaanites

in
the
following
passages

the

them
did
these
commands
enjoin
the
unconditional
and
universal
destruction
of
the
or
merely
of
the
the
word
to
destroy
signifies
as
well
as
individual
destruction
the
destruction
of
existence
equally
with
of
governmental
organization
equally
with
the
lives
of
the
subjects

if
we
interpret
the
words
destroy
consume

to
mean
destruction
what
meaning
shall
we
give
to
the
expressions
drive
out
before
thee
cast

these

given
to
the
israelites
long
they
entered

they
must
have
inferred
from
them
that
a
multitude
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
were
to

their

have

usurpation

carry
them

saul
was
rejected
from

for
disobeying

commands

joshua
disobeyed
him
in
every
instance

at
his
death
the

is
mentioned

and
yet
we
are
told
that
joshua
left
nothing
undone
of
all
that
the
lord
commanded

and
that
he
took
all
that
land
josh

also
that
there
not
a
of
their
enemies
before
them
josh

how
can
this
be
if
the
command
to
destroy

utterly
enjoined
extermination
and
the
command
to
drive
out
unconditional
expulsion
from
the

rather
than
their
expulsion
from

of
it
as
the
lords
of

soil
that
the
latter
is
the
true
sense
to
be
attached
to
those
terms
we
argue
further
from
the
fact
that
the
same
terms
are
employed
by
god
to
describe
the
punishment
which
he
would
inflict
upon
the

thus
indicate
the
sense
in

the

words
are
used
as
an
illustration
of
the
meaning
generally
attached
to
these
and
similar
terms

refer

years

they
had

been

is
another
illustration
we
are
informed
that

remained
in

six
months
with
all
israel
until
he
had
off
every

edom
in
the
next
verse
we
learn
that
hadad
and
certain
edomites
were
not
slain
deut
xx
will
probably
be
quoted
against
the
preceding
view
we
argue
that
the
command
in
these
verses
did
not
include
all
the
individuals
of
the
canaanitish
nations
but
only
the
inhabitants
of
the
and
even
those
conditionally
because
only
the
inhabitants
of
are
specified
of
the
of
these
people
thou
shalt
save
alive
nothing
that
breatheth
cities
then
as
now
were
of
vice
they
reeked
with
abominations
little
practised
in
the
country
on
this
account
their
influence
would
be
far
more
perilous
to
the
israelites
than
that
of
the
country
besides
they
were
the
centres
of
idolatry
there
were
the
temples
and
altars
and
idols
and
priests
without
number
even
their
buildings
streets
and
public
walks
were
so
many
visibilities
of
idolatry
the
reason
assigned
in
the
verse
for
exterminating
them
strengthens
the
idea
that
they
teach
you
not
to
do
after
all
the
abominations
which
they
have
done
unto
their
gods
this
would
be
a
reason
for
exterminating
all
the
nations
and
individuals
them
as
all
were
idolaters
but
god
commanded
them
in
certain
cases
to
spare
the
inhabitants
contact
with
of
them
would
be
perilous
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
peculiarly
and
of
the
cities
so
the
and
verses
contain
the
general
rule
prescribing
the
method
in
which
cities
were
to
be
summoned
to
surrender
they
were
first
to
receive
the
offer
of
peace
if
it
was
accepted
the
inhabitants
became
but
if
they
came
out
against
israel
in
battle
the
were
to
be
killed
and
the
woman
and
little
ones
saved
alive
the
verse
restricts
this
lenient
treatment
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
cities
the
directs
as
to
the
disposal
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
canaanitish
cities
they
were
to
save
alive
nothing
that
breathed
the
common
mistake
has
been
in
supposing
that
the
command
in
the
verse
refers
to
the
system
of
directions
preceding
commencing
with
the
whereas
it
manifestly
refers
only
to
the
specified
in
the
and
making
a
distinction
between
those
cities
that
and
the
cities

case

and

in

only
the
offer
of
peace
and
the
were
as
really
guarantied
to
cities
as
to
others
their
inhabitants
were
not
to
be
exterminated
unless
they
came
out
against
israel
in
battle
whatever
be
the
import
of
the
commands
respecting
the
disposition
to
be
made
of
the
canaanites
all
admit
the
fact
that
the
israelites
did
utterly
exterminate
them
now
if
entire
and
unconditional
extermination
was
the
command
of
god
it
was
obeyed
by
the
israelites
consequently
the
truth
of
god
stood
pledged
to
consign
to
the
same
doom
which
he
had
pronounced
upon
the
canaanites
but
which
they
had
refused
to
visit
upon
them
if
ye
will
not
drive
out
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
from
before
you
then
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
shall
do
unto
you
as
i
thought
to
do
unto
num
xxxiii
as
the
israelites
were
not
exterminated
we
infer
that
god
did
not
pronounce
doom
upon
them
and
as
he
pronounce
upon
them
the
doom
whatever
it
was
which
they
should
to
visit
upon
the
canaanites
it
follows
that
the
doom
of
unconditional
was
pronounced
against
the
canaanites
but
let
us
settle
this
question
by
the
law
and
the
testimony
there
was
not
a
city
that
made
peace
with
the
children
of
israel
save
the
hivites
the
inhabitants
of
gibeon
all
others
they
took
in
battle
for
it
was
of
the
lord
to
harden
their
hearts
that
they
should
come
out
against
israel
in
battle
that
he
might
destroy
them
utterly
and
that
they
might
have
no
favor
but
that
he
might
destroy
them
as
the
lord
commanded
moses
josh
xi
that
is
if
they
had
come
out
against
israel
in
battle
they
would
have
had
favor
shown
them
and
would
not
have
been
the
great
design
was
to
the
of
the
canaanites
to
the
israelites
and
along
with
it
sovereignty
in
every
to
annihilate
their
political
organizations
civil
polity
and
jurisprudence
and
their
system
of
religion
with
all
its
rights
and
appendages
and
to
substitute
therefor
a
pure
theocracy
administered
by
jehovah
with
the
israelites
as
his
representatives
and
agents
in
a
word
the
people
were
to
be
their
political
existence
annihilated
their
idol
temples
altars
groves
images
pictures
and
heathen
rites
destroyed
and
themselves
put
under
tribute
those
who
resisted
the
execution
of
jehovah
purpose
were
to
be
killed
while
those
who
quietly
submitted
to
it
were
to
be
spared
all
had
the
choice
of
these
alternatives
either
free
egress
out
of
the
land
e
or
acquiescence
in
the
decree
with
life
and
residence
as
tributaries
under
the
protection
of
the
government
or
resistance
to
the
execution
of
the
decree
with
death
it
shall
come
to
pass
if
they
will
diligently
learn
the
ways
of
my
people
to
swear
by
my
name
the
lord
liveth
as
they
taught
my
people
to

they

the
prophecy

the

perhaps
it
will
be
objected
that
the
preservation
of
the
gibeonites
and
of

and
her
kindred
was
a
violation
of
the
command
of
god
we
answer
if
it
had
been
we
might
expect
some
such
intimation
if
god
had
straitly
commanded
them
to
all
the
their
pledge
to
save
them
alive
was
neither
a
repeal
of
the
statute
nor
absolution
for
the
breach
of
it
if
was
the
import
of
the
command
would
god
have
permitted
such
an
act
to
pass
without
rebuke
would
he
have
established
such
a
precedent
when
israel
had
hardly
passed
the
threshold
of
canaan
and
was
then
striking
the
first
blow
of
a
half
century
war
what
if
they
passed
their
word
to
rahab
and
the
gibeonites
was
that
more
binding
than
god
command
so
saul
seems
to
have
passed
word
to
agag
yet
samuel
hewed
him
in
pieces
because
in
saving
his
life
saul
had
violated
god
command
when
saul
sought
to
slay
the
gibeonites
in
his
zeal
for
the

of

and
judah

upon

the

sphere
of

restrained
by

from

no

of
legitimate
legislation

which
any
legislature
has
within
its
own
jurisdiction

holds
over
the

of

it
has
been
objected

the
clause
in

respects
merely
police
regulations
and
that
its
sole
design
was
to
enable
congress
to
protect
itself
against
popular
tumults
but
if
the
convention
that
framed
the
constitution
aimed
to
provide
for
a
case
only
why
did
they
provide
for

whatsoever
besides
this
clause
was
opposed
in
many
of

assailed
it
on

ground
mason
said
this
clause
gives
an
unlimited
authority
in
every
possible
case
within
the
district
he
would
willingly
give
them
exclusive
power
as
far
as
respected
the
police
and
good
government
of
the
place
but
he
would
give
them
no
more
grayson
exclaimed
against
so
large
a
grant
of
power
said
that
control
over
the

and
that
the
continental
congress
never
had
an
idea
of
exclusive
legislation
in
all
cases

said

we
be
told
when
about
to
grant
such
illimitable
authority
that
it
will
never
be
exercised

it

policy

madison
said
in
reply
i
did
conceive
that
the
clause
under
consideration
was
one
of
those
parts
which
would
speak
its
own
praise
i
can
not
comprehend
that
the
power
of

over
a
small
district
will
involve
the
dangers
which

apprehends

are

therefore
delegated

and
minute
specification
is
left
to

it
is
not
within
the
limits
of
human
capacity
to
delineate
on
paper
all
those
particular
cases
and
circumstances
in
which
legislation
by
the
general
legislature
would
be
necessary

said
holland
has
no
ten
miles
square
but
she
has
the
hague
where
the
deputies
of

assemble
but
the
influence
which
it
has
given
the
province
of
holland
to
have
the
seat
of
government
within
its
territory
subject
in
some
respects
to
its
control
has
been
injurious
to
the
other
provinces
the
wisdom
of
the

therefore
manifest

madison
says
the
indispensable
necessity
of
authority
at
the
seat
of
government
carries
its
own
evidence
with
it
finally
that
the
grant
in
question
is
to
be
interpreted
according
to
the
obvious
import
of
its
and
not
in
such
a
way
as
to
restrict
it
to
regulations
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
the
state
of
virginia
proposed
an
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
at
the
time
of
its
adoption
providing
that
this
clause
should
be
so
construed
as
to
give
power
only
over
the
and
good
of
said
district
amendment
was
fourteen
other
amendments
proposed
at
the
same
time
by
virginia
were
the
former
part
of
the
clause
under
consideration
congress
shall
have
power
to
exercise
legislation
gives
sole
jurisdiction
and
the
latter
part
in
all
cases
whatsoever
defines
the
of
it
since
then
congress
is
the
legislature
within
the
district
and
since
its
power
is
limited
only
by
the
checks
common
to
all
legislatures
it
follows
that
what
the
power
is
intrinsically
competent
to
do
where
congress
is
competent
to
do
in
the
district
of
columbia
statement
of
the
question
at
issue
having
disposed
of
preliminaries
we
proceed
to
argue
the
at
issue
is
the
power
competent
to
abolish
slavery
when
not
restricted
in
that
particular
by
constitutional
provisions
or
the
abolition
of
slavery
within
the
appropriate
sphere
of
legislation
in
every
government
absolute
sovereignty
exists
in
the
united
states
it
exists
primarily
with
the
and
sovereignty
exists
with
them
in
each
of
the
states
the
legislature
possesses
a
sovereignty
delegated
by
the
people
through
the
constitution
the
people
thus
committing
to
the
legislature
a
portion
of
their
sovereignty
and
specifying
in
their
constitutions
the
amount
and
the
conditions
of
the
grant
that
the
in
any
state
where
slavery
exists
have
the
power
to
abolish
it
none
will
deny
if
the
legislature
have
not
the
power
it
is
because
have
reserved
it
to
themselves
had
they
lodged
with
the
legislature
power
to
exercise
exclusive
legislation
in
all
cases
whatsoever
they
would
have
parted
with
their
sovereignty
over
the
legislation
of
the
state
and
so
far
forth
the
legislature
would
have
become
clothed
with
all
their
functions
and
as
such
competent
the
continuance
of
the
to
do
whatever
the
people
might
have
done
before
the
surrender
of
their
power
consequently
they
would
have
the
power
to
abolish
slavery
the
sovereignty
of
the
district
of
columbia
exists
where
is
it
lodged
the
citizens
of
the
district
have
no
legislature
of
their
own
no
representation
in
congress
and
no
political
power
whatever
maryland
and
virginia
have
surrendered
to
the
united
states
their
full
and
absolute
right
and
entire
sovereignty
and
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
committed
to
congress
by
the
constitution
the
power
to
exercise
exclusive
legislation
in
all
cases
whatsoever
over
such
district
thus
the
sovereignty
of
the
district
of
columbia
is
shown
to
reside
solely
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
since
the
power
of
the
people
of
a
state
to
abolish
slavery
within
their
own
limits
results
from
their
entire
sovereignty
within
the
state
so
the
power
of
congress
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
results
from
its
entire
within
the
district
if
it
be
objected
that
congress
can
have
no
more
power
over
the
district
than
was
held
by
the
legislatures
of
maryland
and
virginia
we
ask
what
clause
in
the
constitution
graduates
the
power
of
congress
by
the
standard
of
a
state
legislature
was
the
united
states
constitution
worked
into
its
present
shape
under
the
measuring
line
and
square
of
virginia
and
maryland
and
is
its
power
to
be
bevelled
down
till
it
can
run
in
the
grooves
of
state
legislation
there
is
a
deal
of
prating
about
constitutional
power
over
the
district
as
though
congress
were
indebted
for
it
to
maryland
and
virginia
the
powers
of
those
states
whether
few
or
many
prodigies
or
nullities
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
as
well
thrust
in
the
powers
of
the
grand
lama
to
join
issue
upon
or
twist
papal
bulls
into
constitutional
tether
with
which
to
curb
congressional
action
the
constitution
of
the
united

gives
power
to
congress
and
takes
it
away
and
maryland
and
virginia
adopted
the
constitution
they
ceded
to
the
united
states
the
territory
of
the
district
by
their
acts
of
cession
they
abdicated
their
own
sovereignty
over
the
district
and
thus
made
room
for
that
provided
by
the
united
states
constitution
which
sovereignty
was
to
commence
as
soon
as
a
cession
of
territory
by
states
and
its
acceptance
by
congress
furnished
a
sphere
for
its
exercise
that
the
abolition
of
slavery
is
within
the
sphere
of
legislation
i
argue
from
the
fact
that
as
a
legal
system
is
the
creature
of
the
law
by
slavery
not
only
affirmed
its
to
be
within
the
sphere
and
under
the
control
of
legislation
but
equally
the
and
of
its
existence
and
the
whether
or
not
it
exist
of
course
legislation
would
not
travel
of
its
sphere
in
abolishing
what
is
it
and
what
was
recognised
to
be
within
it
by
its
own
act
can
not
legislatures
repeal
their
own
laws
if
law
can
take
from
a
man
his
rights
it
can
give
them
back
again
if
it
can
say
your
body
belongs
to
your
neighbor
it
can
say
it
belongs
to
and
i
will
sustain
your
right
if
it
can
annul
a
man
right
to
himself
held
by
express
grant
from
his
maker
and
can
create
for
another
an
artificial
title
to
him
can
it
not
annul
the
artificial
title
and
leave
the
original
owner
to
hold
himself
by
his
original
title
abolition
of
slavery
has
always
been
considered
within
the
appropriate
sphere
of
almost
every
civilized
nation
has
abolished
slavery
by
law
the
history
of
legislation
since
the
revival
of
letters
is
a
record
crowded
with
testimony
to
the
universally
admitted
competency
of
the
power
to
abolish
slavery
it
is
so
manifestly
an
attribute
not
merely
of
absolute
sovereignty
but
even
of
ordinary
legislation
that
the
competency
of
a
legislature
to
exercise
it
may
well
nigh
be
reckoned
among
the
legal
axioms
of
the
civilized
world
even
the
night
of
the
dark
ages
was
not
dark
enough
to
make
this
invisible
the
abolition
decree
of
the
great
council
of
england
was
passed
in
the
memorable
irish
decree
that
all
the
english
slaves
in
the
whole
of
ireland
be
immediately
emancipated
and
restored
to
their
former
liberty
was
issued
in
slavery
in

was
abolished
by
a

the
abolition
of
slavery

the
middle
ages
and

to
the

in

the

passed
an
act
of
abolition
in
connecticut
in
rhode
island
in

by

in

for

when
it
has
been
embodied
in

and
celebrated
in

is
it
forsooth
an
achievement
of
modern
discovery
that
such
a

is
a
nullity
that

it
the

necessary
to
secure
the

this
grant
of

to
those
legislatures
empowers
them
to
decide
what

what
is
humane
treatment
otherwise
it
gives
no

the

is
mere
waste
paper
and
flouts

befooled

a

may
also
believe
that

forcing
them
to
work
without

as

the

is

the

of
competency
of

has
been

by

either
directly

by

power
to
emancipate

the

some
distinguished
service
and
others
by

prohibitory

the
constitutions
of
mississippi
arkansas

other
states
restrict
the
power
of
the
legislature
in
this
respect
why
this
express
prohibition
if
the
power
can
not
abolish
slavery
a
stately
farce
indeed
formally
to
construct
a
special
clause
and
with
appropriate
rites
induct
it
into
the
constitution
for
the
express
purpose
of
restricting
a
nonentity
to
take
from
the
lawmaking
power
what
it
and
what
pertain
to
it
the
legislatures
of
those
states
have
no
power
to
abolish
slavery
simply
because
their
constitutions
have
expressly
that
power
the
people
of
arkansas
mississippi
well
knew
the
competency
of
the
power
to
abolish
slavery
and
hence
their
zeal
to
it
the
fact
that
these
and
other
states
have
inhibited
their
legislatures
from
the
exercise
of
this
power
shows
that
the
abolition
of
slavery
is
acknowledged
to
be
a
proper
subject
of
legislation
when
constitutions
impose
no
restrictions
the
slaveholding
states
have
recognised
this
power
in
their
the
virginia
legislature
passed
a
law
in
to
prevent
the
further
importation
of
slaves
of
which
the
following

upon
such
importation

conceding
both
the
competency

to
abolish

and
the
power
of

to
do
it
within
its
jurisdiction
besides
these
acts
show
the
prevalent
belief
at
that
time
in
the
slaveholding
states
that
the
general
government
had
adopted
a
line
of
policy
aiming
at
the
exclusion
of
slavery
from
the
entire
territory
of

not
included
within
the
original
states

that
this
policy
would
be
pursued
unless
prevented
by
specific
and
formal
stipulation
slaveholding
states
have
asserted
this
power
their
judicial
in
numerous
cases
their
highest
courts
have
decided
that
if
the
legal
owner
of
slaves
takes
them
into
those
states
where
slavery
has
been
abolished
either
by
law
or
by
the
constitution
such
removal
emancipates
them
such
law
or
constitution
abolishing
their
slavery

close
of
a
month
debate
the
following
proceedings
were
had
i
extract
from
an
editorial
article
of
the
richmond
whig
of
january
the
report
of
the
select
committee
adverse
to
legislation
on
the
subject
of
abolition
was
in
these
words
as
the
opinion
of
this
committee
that
it
is
inexpedient
for
the
present
to
make
any
legislative
enactments
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
this
report
preston
moved
to
reverse
and
thus
to
declare
that
it
expedient
to
make
legislative
enactments
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
this
was
meeting
the
question
in
its
strongest
form
it
demanded
action
and
immediate
action
on
this
proposition
the
vote
was
to
many
of
the
most
decided
friends
of
abolition
voted
against
the
amendment
because
they
thought
public
opinion
not
sufficiently
prepared
for
it
and
that
it
might
prejudice
the
cause
to
move
too
rapidly
the
vote
on
witcher
motion
to
postpone
the
whole
subject
indefinitely
indicates
the
true
state
of
opinion
in
the
that
was
the
test
question
and
was
so
intended
and
proclaimed
by
its
mover
that
motion
was
to
showing
a
majority
of
who
by
that
vote
declared
their
belief
that
at
the
proper
time
and
in
the
proper
mode
virginia
ought
to
commence
a
system
of
gradual
abolition
congress
of
the
united
states
have
asserted
this
the
ordinance
of
declaring
that
there
should
be
neither
slavery
nor
involuntary
servitude
in
the
north
western
territory
abolished
the
slavery
then
existing
there
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
in
its
decision
in
the
case
of
harvey
decker
walker
mi
declared
that
the
ordinance
emancipated
the
slaves
then
held
there
in
this
decision
the
question
is
argued
ably
and
at
great
length
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
made
the
same
decision
in
the
case
of
forsyth
nash
martin
la
reps
the
same
doctrine
was
laid
down
by
judge
porter
late
united
states
senator
from
louisiana
in
his
decision
at
the
march
term
of
the
la
supreme
court
in
the
case
of
merry
chexnaider
martin
that
the
ordinance
abolished
the
slavery
then
existing
is
also
shown
by
the
fact
that
persons
holding
slaves
in
the
territory
petitioned
for
the
repeal
of
the
article
abolishing
slavery
assigning
that
as
a
reason
the
petition
of
the
citizens
of
randolph
and
clair
counties
in
the
illinois
country
stating
that
they
were
in
possession
of
slaves
and
praying
the
repeal
of
that
act
the
article
of
the
ordinance
of
and
the
passage
of
a
law
legalizing
slavery
there
am
state
papers
public
lands
congress
passed
this
ordinance
before
the
united
states
constitution
was
adopted
when
it
derived
all
its
authority
from
the
articles
of
confederation
which
conferred
powers
of
legislation
far
more
restricted
than
those
conferred
on
congress
over
the
district
and
territories
by
the
united
states
constitution
now
we
ask
how
does
the
constitution
the
powers
which
congress
possessed
under
the
articles
of
confederation
the
abolition
of
the
slave
trade
by
congress
in
is
another
illustration
of
the
competency
of
legislative
power
to
abolish
slavery
the
african
slave
trade
has
become
such
a
mere
in
common
parlance
that
the
fact
of
its
being
is
overlooked
the
buying
and
selling
the
transportation
and
the
horrors
of
the
middle
passage
were
mere
of
the
slavery
in
which
the
victims
were
held
let
things
be
called
by
their
own
names
when
congress
abolished
the
african
slave
trade
it
abolished
slavery
supreme
slavery
power
frantic
with
license
trampling
a
whole
hemisphere
scathed
with
its
fires
and
running
down
with
blood
true
congress
did
not
in
the
abolition
of
the
slave
trade
abolish
the
slavery
within
its
jurisdiction
but
it
did
abolish
all
the
slavery
in
of
its
jurisdiction
what
has
rifled
it
of
power
to
abolish
slavery
in
part
of
its
jurisdiction
especially
in
that
part
where
it
has
exclusive
legislation
in
all
cases
whatsoever
constitution
of
the
united
states
recognizes
this
power
by
the
most
conclusive
in
art
sec
clause
it
prohibits
the
abolition
of
the
slave
trade
previous
to
thus
implying
the
power
of
congress
to
do
it
at
once
but
for
the
restriction
and
its
power
to
do
it
when
that
restriction
ceased
again
in
art
sec
no
person
held
to
service
or
labor
in
one
state
under
the
laws
thereof
escaping
into
another
shall
in
consequence
of
any
law
or
regulation
therein
be
discharged
from
said
service
or
labor
this
clause
was
inserted
as
all
admit
to
prevent
the
runaway
slave
from
being
emancipated
by
the
of
the
free
states
if
these
laws
had
to
emancipate
why
this
constitutional
guard
to
prevent
it
the
insertion
of
the
clause
was
the
testimony
of
the
eminent
jurists
that
framed
the
constitution
to
the
existence
of
the
and
their
public
proclamation
that
the
abolition
of
slavery
was
within
the
appropriate
sphere
of
legislation
the
right
of
the
owner
to
that
which
is
rightfully
property
is
founded
on
a
principle
of
and
is
recognised
and
protected
by
all
civilized
nations
property
in
slaves
is
by
general
consent
an
hence
slaveholders
insisted
upon
the
insertion
of
this
clause
in
the
united
states
constitution
that
they
might
secure
by
an
that
from
which
protection
is
withheld
by
the
acknowledged
principles
of
universal
law
a
by
demanding
this
provision
slaveholders
consented
that
their
slaves
should
not
be
recognised
as
property
by
the
united
states
constitution
and
hence
they
found
their
claim
on
the
fact
of
their
being
and
to
service
footnote
a
the
fact
that
under
the
articles
of
confederation
slaveholders
whose
slaves
had
escaped
into
free
states
had
no
legal
power
to
force
them
back
that
they
have
no
power
to
recover
by
process
of
law
their
slaves
who
escape
to
canada
the
south
american
states
or
to
europe
the
case
already
cited
in
which
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
decided
that
residence
one
under
the
laws
of
france
emancipated
an
american
slave
the
case
of
fulton
lewis
har
and
john
where
the
slave
of
a
domingo
slaveholder
who
brought
him
to
maryland
in
was
pronounced
free
by
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
these
with
other
facts
and
cases
too
numerous
to
mention
are
illustrations
of
the
acknowledged
truth
here
asserted
that
by
the
consent
of
the
civilized
world
and
on
the
principles
of
universal
law
slaves
are
not
but
and
that
whenever
held
as
property
under
it
is
only
by
legislative
forcibly
setting
aside
the
law
of
nature
the
common
law
and
the
principles
of
universal
justice
and
right
between
man
and
man
principles
paramount
to
all
law
and
from
which
alone
law
derives
its
intrinsic
authoritative
sanction
but
waiving
all
concessions
whether
of
constitutions
laws
judicial
decisions
or
common
consent
i
take
the
position
that
the
power
of
congress
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
follows
from
the
fact
that
as
the
sole
legislature
there
it
has
unquestionable
power
adopt
the
common
law
as
the
legal
system
within
its
exclusive
this
has
been
done
with
certain
restrictions
in
most
of
the
states
either
by
legislative
acts
or
by
constitutional
implication
the
common
law
knows
no
slaves
its
principles
annihilate
slavery
wherever
they
touch
it
it
is
a
universal
unconditional
abolition
act
wherever
slavery
is
a
legal
system
it
is
so
only
by
law
and
in
violation
of
common
law
the
declaration
of
lord
chief
justice
holt
that
by
the
common
law
no
man
can
have
property
in
another
is
an
acknowledged
axiom
and
based
upon
the
well
known
common
law
definition
of
property
the
subjects
of
dominion
or
property
are
as
from
let
congress
adopt
the
common
law
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
slavery
there
is
at
once
abolished
congress
may
well
be
at
home
in
common
law
legislation
for
the
common
law
is
the
grand
element
of
the
united
states
constitution
all
its
provisions
are
instinct
with
its
spirit
and
its
existence
principles
and
paramount
authority
are
presupposed
and
assumed
throughout
the
whole
the
preamble
of
the
constitution
plants
the
standard
of
the
common
law
immovably
in
its
foreground
we
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
order
to
establish
justice
do
ordain
and
establish
this
constitution
thus
proclaiming
to
as
the
controlling
motive
in
the
organization
of
the
government
and
its
secure
establishment
the
chief
object
of
its
aims
by
this
most
solemn
recognition
the
common
law
that
grand
legal
embodiment
of
and
fundamental
right
was
made

groundwork
of
the

its
strongest
munitions

the
last
clause

with
articles
and
of
the
amendments
are
also

recognitions
of
the
common
law
as
the
presiding
genius
of
the
constitution
by
adopting
the
common
law
within
its
exclusive
jurisdiction
congress
would
carry
out
the
principles
of
our
glorious
declaration
and
follow
the
highest
precedents
in
our
national
history
and
jurisprudence
it
is
a
political
maxim
as
old
as
civil
legislation
that
laws
should
be
strictly
homogeneous
with
the
principles
of
the
government
whose
will
they
express

them
out

of
the
government

illustrations
of
its
genius
and
spirit
while
they
proclaim
and
enforce

who
needs
be
told
that
slavery
is
in
antagonism
to
the
principles
of
the
declaration
and
the
spirit
of
the
constitution
and
that
these
and
the
principles
of
the
common
law
gravitate
toward
each
other
with
irrepressible
affinities
and
mingle
into
one
the
common
law
came
hither
with
our
pilgrim
fathers
it
was
their
birthright
their
panoply
their
glory
and
their
song
of
rejoicing
in
the
house
of
their
pilgrimage
it
covered
them
in
the
day
of
their
calamity
and
their
trust

under
the
shadow
of
its
wings
from
the
first
settlement
of

country
the
genius
of
our
institutions
and

national
spirit

claimed

as
a
common
possession

it
with
a
common
pride
a
century
ago
governor
pownall
one
of
the
most
eminent
constitutional
jurists
of
colonial
times
said
of
the
common
law
in
all
the
colonies
the
common
law
is
received
as
the
foundation
and
main
body
of
their
law
in
the
declaration
of
rights
made
by
the
continental
congress
at
its
first
session
in
there
was
the
following
resolution
resolved
that
the
respective
colonies
are
entitled
to
the
common
law
of
england
and
especially
to
the
great
and
inestimable
privilege
of
being
tried
by
their
peers
of
the
vicinage
according
to
the
course
of
that
law
soon
after
the
organization
of
the
general
government
chief
justice
ellsworth
in
one
of
his
decisions
on
the
bench
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
said
the
common
law
of
this
country
remains
the
same
as
it
was
before
the
revolution
chief
justice
marshall
in
his
decision
in
the
case
of
livingston
jefferson
said
when
our
ancestors
migrated
to
america
they
brought
with
them
the
common
law
of
their
native
country
so
far
as
it
was
applicable
to
their
new
situation
and
i
do
not
conceive
that
the
revolution
in
any
degree
changed
the
relations
of
man
to
man
or
the
law
which
regulates
them
in
breaking
our
political
connection
with
the
parent
state
we
did
not
break
our
connection
with
each
other
law
journal
new
duponceau
in
his
dissertation
on
the
jurisdiction
of
courts
in
the
united
states
says
i
consider
the
common
law
of
england
the
of
the
united
states
i
think
i
can
lay
it
down
as
a
correct
principle
that
the
common
law
of
england
as
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
declaration
of
independence
still
continues
to
be
the
national
law
of
this
country
so
far
as
it
is
applicable
to
our
present
state
and
subject
to
the
modifications
it
has
received
here
in
the
course
of
nearly
half
a
century
chief
justice
taylor
of
north
carolina
in
his
decision
in
the
case
of
the
state

in
hawkes
says
a
law
of
obligation
to
the
was
violated
by
the
offence
common
law
founded
upon
the
law
of
nature
and
confirmed
by
revelation
the
legislation
of
the
united
states
abounds
in
recognitions
of
the
principles
of
the
common
law
asserting
their
paramount
binding
power
sparing
details
of
which
our
national
state
papers
are
full
we
illustrate
by
a
single
instance
it
was
made
a
condition
of
the
admission
of
louisiana
into
the
union
that
the
right
of
trial
by
jury
should
be
secured
to
all
her
citizens
the
united
states
government
thus
employing
its
power
to
enlarge
the
jurisdiction
of
the
common
law
in
this
its
great
representative
having
shown
that
the
abolition
of
slavery
is
within
the
competency
of
the
power
when
unrestricted
by
constitutional
provisions
and
that
the
legislation
of
congress
over
the
district
thus
unrestricted
its
power
to
abolish
slavery
there
is
established
besides
this
general
ground
the
power
of
congress
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
may
be
based
upon
another
equally
tenable
we
argue
it
from
the
fact
that
slavery
exists
there
by
an
act
of
congress
in
the
act
of
july
congress
accepted
portions
of
territory
offered
by
the
states
of
maryland
and
virginia
and
enacted
that
the
laws
as
they
then
were
should
continue
in
force
until
congress
shall
otherwise
by
law
provide
thus
making
the
slave
codes
of
maryland
and
virginia
its
own
under
these
laws
adopted
by
congress
and
in
effect
and
made
laws
of
the
district
the
slaves
there
are
now
held
is
congress
so
impotent
in
its
own
exclusive
jurisdiction
that
it
otherwise
by
law
provide
if
it
can
say
what
be
considered
property
it
can
say
what
shall
be
considered
property
suppose
a
legislature
enacts
that
marriage
contracts
shall
be
mere
bills
of
sale
making
a
husband
the
proprietor
of
his
wife
as
his
property
and
suppose
husbands
should
herd
their
wives
in
droves
for
the
market
as
beasts
of
burden
or
for
the
brothel
as
victims
of
lust
and
then
prate
about
their
inviolable
legal
property
and
deny
the
power
of
the
legislature
which
stamped
them
property
to
undo
its
own
wrong
and
secure
to
wives
by
law
the
rights
of
human
beings
would
such
cant
about
legal
rights
be
heeded
where
reason
and
justice
held
sway
and
where
law
based
upon
fundamental
morality
received
homage
if
a
frantic
legislature
pronounces
woman
a
chattel
has
it
no
power
with
returning
reason
to
take
back
the
blasphemy
is
the
impious
edict
irrepealable
be
it
that
with
legal
forms
it
has
stamped
wives
wares
can
no
legislation
blot
out
the
brand
must
the
handwriting
of
deity
on
human
nature
be
expunged
for
ever
has
law
no
power
to
stay
the
erasing
pen
and
tear
off
the
scrawled
label
that
covers
up
the
image
of
god
we
now
proceed
to
show
that
the
power
of
congress
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
has
been
till
recently
universally
conceded
it
has
been
assumed
by
congress
itself

stands
on
the
journals
of

as
originally
proposed
it
was
negatived
by
a
majority
of
though
the
motion
was
lost
it
was
on
the
ground
of
its
alleged
alone

not
because
congress
lacked
the
constitutional
power
in
the
debate
which
preceded
the
vote
the
of
congress
was
conceded
in

if

not

why

richard

in

says
congress
has
the
express
power
stipulated
by
the
constitution
to
exercise
exclusive
legislation
over
this
district
of
ten
miles
square
here
slavery
is
sanctioned
by
law
in
the
district

containing
a
population
of
souls
and
probably
as
many
slaves
as
the
whole
territory
of
missouri
the
power
of
providing
for
their
emancipation
rests
with
congress
alone
why
then
let
me
ask
president
why
all
this
sensibility
this
commiseration
this
sympathy
for
the
slaves
of
missouri
and
this
cold
insensibility
this
eternal
apathy
towards
the
slaves
in
the
district
of
columbia
it
is
quite
unnecessary
to
add
that
the
most
distinguished
northern
statesmen
of
both
political
parties
have
always
affirmed
the
power
of
congress
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
president
van
buren
in
his
letter
of
march
to
a
committee

gentlemen
in
north
carolina
says
i
would
not
from
the
light
now
before
me
feel
myself
safe
in
pronouncing
that
congress
does
not
possess
the
power
of
abolishing
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
this
declaration
of
the
president
is
consistent
with
his
avowed
sentiments
touching
the
missouri
question
on
which
he
coincided
with
such
men
as
daniel
tompkins
de
witt
clinton
and
others
whose
names
are
a
host
a
it
is
consistent
also
with
his
recommendation
in
his
late
message
on
the
of
last
month
in
which
speaking
of
the
district
he
strongly
urges
upon
congress
a
thorough
and
careful
revision
of
its
local
government
speaks
of
the
entire
dependence
of
the
people
of
the
district
upon
congress
recommends
that
a
uniform
system
of
local
government
be
adopted
and
adds
that
although
it
was
selected
as
the
seat
of
the
general
government
the
site
of
its
public
edifices
the
depository
of
its
archives
and
the
residence
of
officers
intrusted
with
large
amounts
of
public
property
and
the
management
of
public
business
yet
it
never
has
been
subjected
to
or
received
that
and
legislation
which
these
circumstances
peculiarly
demanded
footnote
a
van
buren
when
a
member
of
the
senate
of
voted
for
the
following
preamble
and
resolutions
which
passed
unanimously
whereas
the
inhibiting
the
further
extension
of
slavery
in
the
united
states
is
a
subject
of
deep
concern
to
the
people
of
this
state
and
whereas
we
consider
slavery
as
an
evil
much
to
be
deplored
and
that
constitutional
barrier
should
be
interposed
to
prevent
its
further
and
that
the

of
the

gives
congress
the
to
require
new

not
comprised
within
the
original
boundary
of
the
united

to
the
prohibition
of
a
condition
of
their
admission
into

therefore
resolved
that
our
senators
be
instructed
and
our
members
of

be
requested
to
oppose
the

as

memorials
may
be
taken
as
universal
exponents
of
the
sentiments
of

statesmen
as
to
the
power
of
congress
to
abolish
slavery
in

array
of
evidence
to
show
that
the
power
of
congress
to
abolish

in
the
district
has
always
till
recently
been
is
perhaps
quite
superfluous

subjoin
however
the
following
the
of

in
his
speech
on
the
missouri
question
quoted
above
after
contending
that
the
restriction
of
slavery
in
missouri
would
be
unconstitutional
adds
but
i
am
at
a
loss
to
conceive
why
gentlemen
should
arouse
all
their
sympathies
upon
this
occasion
when
they
permit
them
to
lie
dormant
upon
the
same
subject
in
relation
to
other
sections
of
country
in
which
their
power
could
not
be
questioned
then
follows
immediately
the
assertion
of
congressional
power
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
as
already
quoted
in
the
speech
of

quoted

report
is
thus
reported
in

washington
globe
of

he
replied
to
the
remark
that
the
report
conceded
that
congress
had
a
right
to
legislate
upon
the
subject
in
the
district
of

and
said
that
such
a
right
had
never
been

congress
has

would
hardly
be
necessary
to
state
this
as
a
distinct
proposition
had
it
not
been
occasionally
questioned
the
truth
of
the
assertion
however
is
too
obvious
to
admit
of
argument
and
we
believe
has
never
been
disputed
by
persons
who
are
familiar
with
the
constitution
finally
an
explicit
and
unexpected
admission
that
an
of
the
congress
concede
the
power
to
abolish

in

district
has
just
been
made
by
a
member
of
congress
from
south
carolina
in
a
letter
published
in
the
charleston
mercury
of
well
known
as
the
of
calhoun
the
following
is
an
extract
the
time
has
arrived
when
we
must
have
new
guarantees
under
the
constitution
or
the
union
must
be
dissolved
views
of
the
constitution
are
not
those
of
the
majority
an
overwhelming
majority
think
that
by
the
constitution
congress
may
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
may
abolish
the
slave
trade
between
the
states
that
is
it
may
prohibit
their
being
carried
out
of
the
state
in
which
they
are
and
prohibit
it
in
all
the
territories
florida
among
them
they
not
without
strong
reasons
the
power
of
congress
extends
to
all
of
these
in
another
letter
the
same
correspondent
says
fact
is
it
is
vain
to
as
the
constitution
is
now
keep
the
question
of
slavery
out
of
the
halls
of
until
by
some
decisive
action
we
compel
silence
or
the
agitation
and
insult
is
our
eternal
fate
in
the
confederacy
objections
to
the
foregoing
conclusions
considered
we
now
proceed
to
notice
briefly
the
main
arguments
that
have
been
employed
in
congress
and
elsewhere
against
the
power
of
congress
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
one
of
the
most
plausible
is
that
the
conditions
on
which
maryland
and
virginia
ceded
the
district
to
the
united
states
would
be
violated
if
congress
should
abolish
slavery
there
the
reply
to
this
is
that
congress
had
no
power
to
a
cession
coupled
with
conditions
restricting
the
power
given
it
by
the
constitution
nothing
short
of
a
convention
of
the
states
and
an
alteration
of
the
constitution
abridging
its
grant
of
power
could
have
empowered
congress
to
accept
a
territory
on
any
other
conditions
than
that
of
exercising
exclusive
legislation
in
all
cases
whatsoever
over
it
to
show
the
futility
of
the
objection
here
follow
the
acts
of
cession
the
cession
of
maryland
was
made
in
november
and
is
as
follows
an
act
to
cede
to
congress
a
district
of
ten
miles
square
in
this
state
for
the
seat
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
be
it
enacted
by
the
general
assembly
of
maryland
that
the
representatives
of
this
state
in
the
house
of
representatives
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
appointed
to
assemble
at
on
the
first
wednesday
of
march
next
be
and
they
are
hereby
authorized
and
required
on
the
behalf
of
this
state
to
cede
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
any
district
in
this
state
not
exceeding
ten
miles
square
which
the
congress
may
fix
upon
and
accept
for
the
seat
of
government
of
the
united
states
laws
of
maryland
vol
chap
the
cession
from
virginia
was
made
by
act
of
the
legislature
of
that
state
on
the
of
december
in
the
following
words
be
it
enacted
by
the
general
assembly
that
a
tract
of
country
not
exceeding
ten
miles
square
or
any
lesser
quantity
to
be
located
within
the
limits
of
the
state
and
in
any
part
thereof
as
congress
may
by
law
direct
shall
be
and
the
same
is
hereby
for
ever
ceded
and
relinquished
to
the
congress
and
government
of
the
united
states
in
full
and
absolute
right
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
as
well
of
soil
as
of
persons
residing
or
to
reside
thereon
pursuant
to
the
tenor
and
effect
of
the
eighth
section
of
the
first
article
of
the
government
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
but
were
there
no
provisos
to
these
acts
the
maryland
act
had
that
part
of
the
district
therefore
which
includes
the
cities
of
washington
and
georgetown
can
lay
claim
to
nothing
with
which
to
ward
off
the
power
of
congress
the
virginia
act
had
this
proviso
sect
provided
that
nothing
herein
contained
shall
be
construed
to
vest
in
the
united
states
any
right
of
property
in
the
or
to
affect
the
rights
of
individuals
otherwise
than
the
same
shall
or
may
be
transferred
by
such
individuals
to
the
united
states
this
specification
touching
the
soil
was
merely
definitive
and
explanatory
of
that
clause
in
the
act
of
cession
and
absolute
instead
of
restraining
the
power
of
congress
on
and
other
subjects
it
even
gives
it
wider
scope
for
exceptions
to
of
a
rule
give
double
confirmation
to
those
parts
not
embraced
in
the
exceptions
if
it
was
the
of
the
proviso
to
restrict
congressional
action
on
the
subject
of
why
is
the
specified
as
legal
instruments
are
not
paragons
of
economy
in
words
might
not
john
doe
out
of
his
abundance
and
without
spoiling
his
style
have
afforded
an
additional
word
at
least
a
hint
that
slavery
was
though
nothing
was
about
it
the
subject
must
have
been
too
delicate
even
for
the
most
distant
allusion
the
mystery
of
silence
is
solved
but
again
maryland
and
virginia
in
their
acts
of
cession
declare
them
to
be
in
pursuance
of
that
clause
of
the
constitution
which
gives
to
congress
exclusive
legislation
in
all
cases
whatsoever
over
the
ten
miles
square
thus
instead
of
that
clause
both
states
gave
an
express
and
decided
confirmation
of
it
now
their
acts
of
cession
either
accorded
with
that
clause
of
the
constitution
or
they
conflicted
with
it
if
they
conflicted
with
it
the
cessions
was
a
violation
of
the
constitution
if
they
accorded
the
objector
has
already
had
his
answer
the
fact
that
congress
accepted
the
cessions
proves
that
in
its
view
their
did
not
conflict
with
the
constitutional
grant
of
power
to
exercise
exclusive
legislation
in
all
cases
whatsoever
over
such
district
the
inquiry
whether
these
acts
of
cession
were
consistent
or
inconsistent
with
the
united
states
constitution
is
totally
irrelevant
to
the
question
at
issue
what
saith
the
constitution
that
is
the
question
not
what
saith
virginia
or
maryland
or
equally
to
the
point
john
bull
if
maryland
and
virginia
had
been
the
authorized
interpreters
of
the
constitution
for
the
union
these
acts
of
cession
could
hardly
have
been
magnified
more
than
they
were
by
garland
and
wise
in
the
last
congress
a
true
understanding
of
the
constitution
can
be
had
forsooth
only
by
holding
it
up
in
the
light
of
maryland
and
virginia
legislation
we
are
told
again
that
those
states
would
not
have
ceded
the
district
if
they
had
supposed
the
constitution
gave
congress
power
to
abolish
slavery
in
it
this
comes
with
an
ill
grace
from
maryland
and
virginia
they
the
constitution
they
were
parties
to
it
they
had
sifted
it
clause
by
clause
in
their
state
conventions
they
had
weighed
its
words
in
the
balance
they
had
tested
them
as
by
fire
and
finally
after
long
pondering
they
the
constitution
and
they
ceded
the
ten
miles
square
and
declared
the
cession
made
in
pursuance
of
that
clause
congress
shall
have
power
to
exercise
exclusive
legalisation
in
all
cases
whatsoever
over
such
district
and
now
verily
they
would
not
have
ceded
if
they
had
cede
it
they
and
in
full
and
absolute
right
both
of
soil
and
persons
congress
accepted
the
cession
state
power
over
the
district
ceased
and
congressional
power
over
it
commenced
and
now
the
sole
question
to
be
settled
is
amount
of
power
over
the
district
lodged
in
congress
by
the
the
constitution
the
constitution
that
is
the
point
maryland
and
virginia
suppositions
must
be
potent
suppositions
to
abrogate
a
clause
in
the
united
states
constitution
that
clause
either
gives
congress
power
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
or
it
does
and
that
point
is
to
be
settled
not
by
state
suppositions
nor
state
usages
nor
state
legislation
but
the
terms
of
the
clause
southern
members
of
congress
in
the
recent
discussions
have
conceded
the
power
of
a
contingent
abolition
in
the
district
by
suspending
it
upon
the
consent
of
the
people
such
a
doctrine
from
like
alford
of
georgia
and
walker
of
mississippi
would
excite
no
surprise
but
that
it
should
be
honored
with
the
endorsement
of
such
men
as
rives
and
calhoun
is
quite
unaccountable
are
attributes
of
mere
creatures
of
is
delegated
mere
conditional
is
a
to
be
exercised
by
those
who
hold
it
only
by
popular
must
it
lie
helpless
at
the
pool
of
public
sentiment
waiting
the
gracious
troubling
of
its
waters
is
it
a
lifeless
corpse
save
only
when
popular
consent
deigns
to
put
breath
into
its
nostrils
besides
if
the
consent
of
the
people
of
the
district
be
necessary
the
consent
of
the
people
must
be
had
not
that
of
a
majority
however
large
majorities
to
be
authoritative
must
be
and
a
legal
majority
without
legislative
power
right
of
representation
or
even
the
electoral
franchise
would
be
an
anomaly
in
the
district
of
columbia
such
a
thing
as
a
majority
in
a
legal
sense
is
unknown
to
law
to
talk
of
the
power
of
a
majority
or
the
will
of
a
majority
there
is
mere
mouthing
a
majority
then
it
has
an
authoritative
will
and
an
organ
to
make
it
known
and
an
executive
to
carry
it
into
effect
where
are
they
we
repeat
it
if
the
consent
of
the
people
of
the
district
be
necessary
the
consent
of
is
necessary
and
consent
will
come
only
with
the
greek
kalends
and
a
perpetual
motion
a
single
individual
might
thus
perpetuate
slavery
in
defiance
of
the
expressed
will
of
a
whole
people
the
most
common
form
of
this
fallacy
is
given
by
mr
wise
of
virginia
in
his
speech
february
in
which
he
denied
the
power
of
congress
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
unless
the
inhabitants
owning
slaves
petitioned
for
it
southern
members
of
congress
at
the
present
session
ring
changes
almost
daily
upon
the
same
fallacy
what
pray
congress
a
power
which
it
it
is
required
of
a
man
according
to
what
he
saith
the
scripture
i
commend
mr
wise
to
paul
for
his
ethics
would
that
he
had
got
his
of
him
if
congress
does
not
possess
the
power
why
taunt
it
with
its
weakness
by
asking
its
exercise
why
mock
it
by
demanding
impossibilities
petitioning
according
to
mr
wise
is
in
matters
of
legislation
omnipotence
itself
the
very
source
of
all
constitutional
power
for
congress
to
do
what
it
do
gives
it
the
power
to
pray
the
exercise
of
a
power
that
is
it
a
beautiful
theory
let
us
work
it
both
ways
if
to
petition
for
the
exercise
of
a
power
that
is
creates
it
to
petition
against
the
exercise
of
a
power
that
annihilates
it
as
southern
gentlemen
are
partial
to
summary
processes
pray
sirs
try
the
virtue
of
your
own
recipe
on
exclusive
legislation
in
all
cases
whatsoever
a
better
subject
for
experiment
and
test
of
the
prescription
could
not
be
had
but
if
the
petitions
of
the
citizens
of
the
district
give
congress
the
to
abolish
slavery
they
impose
the
if
they
confer
constitutional
authority
they
create
constitutional
obligation
if
congress
abolish
because
of
an
expression
of
their
will
it
abolish
at
the
bidding
of
that
will
if
the
people
of
the
district
are
a
of
to
congress
their
has
the
force
of
a
constitutional
provision
and
has
the
same
binding
power
upon
the
national
legislature
to
make
congress
dependent
on
the
district
for
authority
is
to
make
it
a
of
its
authority
restraining
the
exercise
of
its
own
discretion
and
sinking
it
into
a
mere
organ
of
the
district
will
we
proceed
to
another
objection
the
southern
states
would
not
have
ratified
the
constitution
if
they
had
supposed
that
it
gave
this
power
it
is
a
sufficient
answer
to
this
objection
that
the
northern
states
would
not
have
ratified
it
if
they
had
supposed
that
it
the
power
if
suppositions
are
to
take
the
place
of
the
constitution
coming
from
both
sides
they
neutralize
each
other
to
argue
a
constitutional
question
by
at
the
suppositions
that
might
have
been
made
by
the
parties
to
it
would
find
small
favor
in
a
court
of
law
but
even
a
desperate
shift
is
some
easement
when
sorely
pushed
if
this
question
is
to
be
settled
by
suppositions
suppositions
shall
be
forth
coming
and
that
without
stint
first
then
i
affirm
that
the
north
ratified
the
constitution
supposing
that
slavery
had
begun
to
wax
old
and
would
speedily
vanish
away
and
especially
that
the
abolition
of
the
slave
trade
which
by
the
constitution
was
to
be
surrendered
to
congress
after
twenty
years
would
cast
it
headlong
would
the
north
have
adopted
the
constitution
giving
of
the
slave
property
a
representation
if
it
has
supposed
that
the
slaves
would
have
increased
from
half
a
million
to
two
millions
and
a
half
by
and
that
the
census
of
would
give
to
the
slave
states
representatives
of
slave
property
if
they
had
supposed
that
this
representation
would
have
controlled
the
legislation
of
the
government
and
carried
against
the
north
every
question
vital
to
its
interests
would

such
suicides
as
to
ratify
it
every
instinct
would
have
shrieked
at
such
an
infatuate
immolation
at
the
adoption
of
the

constitution
slavery
was
regarded
as
a

reason
urged

by
testimony

at

of

constitution
and
for
several
years
before
and
after
that
period
slavery
was
rapidly
on

wane
that
the

revolution
with
the
great
events
preceding
accompanying

wrought

immense
and
almost
universal
change
in
the
public
sentiment
of
the
nation
of
the
subject
powerfully
impelling
it
toward
the
entire
abolition
of
the
system
and
that
it
was
the
that
measures
for
its
abolition
throughout
the
union
would
be
commenced
by
the
individual

generally
before

the
continental

in
setting
forth
the
causes
and
the
necessity
for
taking
up
arms
say
it
were
for
men
who
exercise
their
reason
to
believe
that
the
divine
author
of
our
existence
intended
a
part
of
the
human
race
hold
an
absolute
property
and
power
over
marked
out
by
infinite
goodness
and
wisdom
as
objects
of
a
legal
domination
never
rightfully
resistible
however
severe
and
oppressive
the
inhabitants
of
these
colonies
might
at
least
require
from
the
parliament
of
great
britain
some
evidence
that
this
dreadful
authority
over
them
has
been
granted
to
that
body
in
the
celebrated
hopkins
then
at
the
head
of
new
england
divines
published
a
pamphlet
entitled
an
address
to
the
owners
of
negro
slaves
in
the
american
colonies
from
which
the
following
is
an
extract
the
conviction
of
the
unjustifiableness
of
this
practice
slavery
has
been
and
spreading
of
and
who
have
had
slaves
have
found
themselves
so
unable
to
justify
their
own
conduct
in
holding
them
in
bondage
as
to
be
induced
to
them
at
may
this
conviction
soon
reach
every
owner
of
slaves
in
america
slavery
is
every
wrong
unrighteous
and
oppressive
a
very
great
and
crying
sin
being
nothing
of
the
kind
equal
to
it
on
the
face
of
the
the
same
year
the
american
congress
issued
a
solemn
manifesto
to
the
world
these
were
its
first
words
we
hold
these
truths
to
be
that
men
are
created
equal
that
they
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
inalienable
rights
that
among
these
are
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
these
were
words
of
power
a
rhetorical
flourish
the
celebrated
patrick
henry
of
virginia
in
a
letter
of
to
robert
pleasants
afterwards
president
of
the
virginia
abolition
society
says
believe
me
i
shall
honor
the
quakers
for
their
noble
efforts
to
abolish
slavery
it
is
a
debt
we
owe
to
the
purity
of
our
religion
to
show
that
it
is
at
variance
with
that
law
that
warrants
slavery
i
exhort
you
to
persevere
in
so
worthy
a
resolution
in
the
continental
congress
ordered
a
pamphlet
to
be
published
entitled
observations
on
the
american
revolution
from
which
the
following
is
an
extract
the
great
principle
of
government
is
and
ever
will
remain
in
force
men
are
by
nature
as
accountable
to
him
that
made
them
they
must
be
so
and
so
long
as
we
have
any
idea
of
divine
we
must
associate
that
of
whether
men
can
part
with
their
liberty
is
among
the
questions
which
have
exercised
the
ablest
writers
but
it
is
on
all
hands
that
the
right
to
be
can
never
be
alienated
still
less
is
it
practicable
for
one
generation
to
mortgage
the
privileges
of
another
extract
from
the
pennsylvania
act
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
passed
march
we
conceive
that
it
is
our
duty
and
we
rejoice
that
it
is
in
our
power
to
extend
a
portion
of
that
freedom
to
others
which
has
been
extended
to
us
weaned
by
a
long
course
of
experience
from
those
narrow
prejudices
and
partialities
we
have
imbibed
we
find
our
hearts
enlarged
with
kindness
and
benevolence
towards
men
of
all
conditions
and
nations
therefore
be
it
enacted
that
no
child
born
hereafter
be
a
slave
jefferson
in
his
notes
on
virginia
written
just
before
the
close
of
the
revolutionary
war
says
i
think
a
change
already
perceptible
since
the
origin
of
the
present
revolution
the
spirit
of
the
master
is
abating
that
of
the
slave
is
rising
from
the
dust
his
condition
mollifying
way
i
hope
preparing
under
the
auspices
of
for
a
total
emancipation
and
that
this
is
disposed
in
the
order
of
events
to
be
with
the
consent
of
the
masters
rather
than
by
their
extirpation
in
a
letter
to
price
of
london
who
had
just
published
a
pamphlet
in
favor
of
the
abolition
of
slavery
jefferson
then
minister
at
paris
august
says
from
the
mouth
to
the
head
of
the
chesapeake
bulk
of
the
people
will
approve
of
your
pamphlet
in
and
it
will
find
a
respectable
minority
ready
to
it
in
a
minority
which
for
weight
and
worth
of
character
against
the
greater
speaking
of
virginia
he
says
this
is
the
next
state
to
which
we
may
turn
our
eyes
for
the
interesting
spectacle
of
justice
in
conflict
with
avarice
and
oppression
a
conflict
in
which
the
sacred
side
is
gaining
daily
recruits
be
not
therefore
discouraged
what
you
have
written
will
do
a
deal
of
and
could
you
still
trouble
yourself
with
our
welfare
no
man
is
more
able
to
give
aid
to
the
laboring
side
the
college
of
william
and
mary
in
williamsburg
since
the
remodelling
of
its

is
the
place
where
are
collected
together
all
the
young

of

under
preparation
for
public
life
they
are
there
under
the
direction
most
of
them
of
a
wythe
one
of
the
most
virtuous
of
characters
and
sentiments
on
the
subject
of
slavery
are
i
am
satisfied
if
you
could
resolve
to
address
an
exhortation
to
those
young
men
with
all
the
eloquence
of
which
you
are
master
that
influence
on
the
future
decision
of
this
important
question
would
be
great
perhaps
thus
you
see
that
so
far
from
thinking
you
have
cause
to
repent
of
what
you
have
done
wish
you
to
do
more
and
wish
it
on
an
assurance
of
its
jefferson
posthumous
works

on

with

deeply
affected

till

comes
into
this
measure
her
prayers
to
heaven
will
be
impious
this
is
a
strong
expression
but
it
is
just
i
believe
god
governs
the
world
and
i
believe
it
to
be
a
maxim
in

in

that
those
who
ask

to

from
which
the

is
an
extract
from
a
sober
conviction
of
the
unrighteousness
of
slavery
your
petitioners
have
long
beheld
with
grief
our
fellow
men
doomed
to
perpetual
bondage
in
a
country
which
boasts
of
her
freedom
your
petitioners
are
fully
of
opinion
that
calm
reflection
will
at
last
convince
the
world
that
the
whole
system
of
african
slavery
is
unjust
in
its
nature
impolitic
in
its
principles
and
in
its
consequences
ruinous
to
the
industry
and
enterprise
of
the
citizens
of
these
states
from
a
conviction
of
these
truths
your
petitioners
were
led
by
motives
we
conceive
of
general
philanthropy
to
associate
ourselves
for
the
protection
and
assistance
of
this
unfortunate
part
of
our
fellow
men
and
though
this
society
has
been
established
it
has
now
become
through
this
state
and
we
fully
believe
on
this
subject
the
sentiments
of
a
large
majority
of
its
the
same
year
the
virginia
abolition
society
was
formed
this
society
and
the
maryland
society
had
auxiliaries
in
different
parts
of
those
states
both
societies
sent
up
memorials
to

the
memorial
of
the
virginia
society
is
headed
the
memorial
of
the
for
promoting
the
abolition
of
slavery
the
following
is
an
extract
your
memorialists
fully
believing
that
exalteth
a
nation
and
that
slavery
is
not
only
an
odious
degradation
but
an
violation
of
one
of
the
most
essential
rights
of
human
nature
and
utterly
repugnant
to
the
precepts
of
the
which
breathes
on
earth
good
will
to
men
lament
that
a
practice
so
inconsistent
with
true
policy
and
the
inalienable
rights
of
men
should
subsist
in
so
enlightened
an
age
and
among
a
people
professing
that
all
mankind
are
by
nature
equally
entitled
to
freedom
about
the
same
time
a
society
was
formed
in
it
had
an
acting
committee
of
five
members
in
each
county
in
the
state
the
following
is
an
extract
from
the
preamble
to
its
constitution
it
is
our
boast
that
we
live
under
a
government
founded
on
principles
of
justice
and
reason
wherein
and
the
of
are
recognised
as
the
universal
rights
of
men
and
whilst
we
are
anxious
to
preserve
these
rights
to
ourselves
and
transmit
them
inviolate
to
our
posterity
we
that
inconsistent
illiberal
and
interested
policy
which
withholds
those
rights
from

unfortunate
and

i
consider
this

laying

of

the
augmentation

such

disgraceful

much
as

another
thing
will

this

general
heath
said

said
i
hope
speaker
the
petition
of
these
respectable
people
will
be
attended
to
all
the
readiness
the
importance
of
its
object
and
i
can
not
help
expressing
the
pleasure
i
feel
in
finding
considerable
a
of
the
community
attending
to
matters
of
such
a
momentous
concern
to
the
and
happiness
of
the
people
of
america
i
think
it
my
duty
as
a
citizen
of
the
union
espouse
their
mr
page
of
virginia
afterward
governor
was
of
the
commitment
he
hoped
that
the
designs
of
the
respectable
memorialists
would
not
be
stopped
at
the
threshold
in
order
to
preclude
a
fair
discussion
of
the
prayer
of
the
memorial
with
respect
to
the
alarm
that
was
apprehended
he
conjectured
there
was
none
but
there
might
be
just
cause
if
the
memorial
was
taken
into
consideration
he
placed
himself
in
the
case
of
a
slave
and
said
that
on
hearing
that
congress
had
refused
to
listen
to
the
decent
suggestions
of
a
respectable
part
of
the
community
he
should
infer
that
the
general
government
which
was
expected
great
good
would
result
every
class
had
shut
their
ears
against
the
voice
of
humanity
and
he
should
despair
of
any
alleviation
of
the
miseries
he
and
his
posterity
had
in
prospect
if
any
thing
could
induce
him
to
rebel
it
must
be
a
stroke
like
this
impressing
on
his
mind
all
the
horrors
of
despair
but
if
he
was
told
that
application
was
made
in
his
behalf
and
that
congress
were
willing
to
hear
what
could
be
urged
in
favor
of
discouraging
the
practice
of
importing
his
he
would
trust
in
their
justice
and
humanity
and
the
decision
scott
of
pennsylvania
i
can
not
for
my
part
conceive
how
any
person
be
said
to
acquire
a
property
in
but
enough
of
those
who
reduce
men
to
the
state
of
transferable
goods
or
use
them
like
beasts
of
burden
who
deliver
them
up
as
the
property
or
patrimony
of
another
man
let
us
argue
on
principles
countenanced
by
reason
and
becoming
humanity
do
not
know
how
far
i
might
go
if
i
was
one
of
the
judges
of
the
united
states
and
those
people
were
to
come
before
me
and
claim
their
emancipation
but
i
am
sure
i
would
go
as
far
as

feared

be
referred

all
their
opposition
smith
of
south
carolina
said
that
on
entering
into
this
government
they
south
carolina
and
georgia
apprehended
that
the
other
states
not
knowing
the
necessity
the
citizens
of
the
southern
states
were
under
to
hold
this
species
of
property
from
motives
of
humanity
and
benevolence
be
led
to
vote
for
a
general
and
had
they
not
seen
that
the
constitution
provided
against
the
effect
of
such
a
disposition
i
may
be
bold
to
say
they
never
would
have
adopted
it
in
the
debate
at
the
same
session
may
on
the
petition
of

respecting
the

trade
parker
of

said
he
hoped
congress
would
do
all
that
lay
in
their
power
to
to
human
nature
its
inherent
and
if
possible
wipe
off
the
stigma
which
america
labored
under
the
inconsistency
in
our
principles
with
which
we
are
justly
charged
be
done
that
we
may
show
by
our
actions
the
pure
beneficence
of
the
doctrine
we
held
out
to
the
world
in
our
declaration
of
independence
jackson
of
georgia
said
it
was
the
fashion
of
the
day
to
favor
the
liberty
of
the
slaves
what
is
to
be
done
for
compensation
will
virginia
set
all
her
negroes
free
will
they
give
up
the
money
they
have
cost
them
and
to
whom
this
practice
comes
to
be
tried
then
the
sound
of
liberty
will
lose
those
charms
which
make
it
grateful
to
the
ravished
madison
of
virginia
the
dictates
of
humanity
the
principles
of
the
people
the
national
safety
and
happiness
and
prudent
policy
require
it
of
us
the
constitution
has
particularly
called
our
attention
to
it
i
conceive
the
constitution
in
this
particular
was
formed
in
order
that
the
government
whilst
it
was
restrained
from
having
a
total
prohibition
might
be
able
to
some
testimony
of
the
sense
of
with
respect
to
the
african
trade
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
by
expressing
a
national
disapprobation
of
this
trade
we
may
destroy
it
and
save
ourselves
from
reproaches
and
our
posterity
the
imbecility
ever
attendant
on
a
country
filled
with
slaves
i
do
not
wish
to
say
any
thing
harsh
to
the
hearing
of
gentlemen
who
entertain
different
sentiments
from
me
or
different
sentiments
from
those
i
represent
but
if
there
is
any
one
point
in
which
it
is
clearly
the
policy
of
this
nation
so
far
as
we
constitutionally
can
vary
the
obtaining
under
some
of
the
state
governments
it
is
this
but
it
is
a
majority
of
the

opposes
the
abolition

and
avows
himself
a
says
i
have
seen
in
the
papers
accounts
of
and
applications
to
government
for
abolition
of
religion
humanity
and
the
generosity
natural
to
a
free
people
are
the
principles
which
dictate
those
such
motives
command
respect
and
are
above
any
eulogium

it
is
well
known
that
in
the
convention
that
formed
the
constitution
of
kentucky
in
the
effort
to
prohibit
slavery
was
nearly
successful
the
writer
has
frequently
heard
it
asserted
in
kentucky
and
has
had
it
from
some
who
were
members
of
that
convention
that
a
decided
majority
of
that
body
would
have
voted
for
its
exclusion

great
efforts
and

of

and

the

extract
from
a
speech
made
in
that
convention
by
a
member
of

rice
a
native
virginian
is
a
specimen
of
the
that
prevailed
on
that
delicate
subject
said
rice
i
do
a
man
greater
injury
when
i
deprive
him
of
his
liberty
than
when
i
deprive
him
of
his
property
it
is
vain
for
me
to
plead
that
i
have
the
sanction
of
law
for
this
makes
the
injury
the
greater
it
arms
the
community
against
him
and
makes
his
case
desperate
the
owners
of
such
slaves
then
are
and
not
the
just
proprietors
of
what
they
claim
freeing
them
is
not
depriving
them
of
property
but
it
to
the
right
in
america
a
slave
is
a
standing
monument
of
the
tyranny
and
inconsistency
of
human
governments
the
master
is
the
enemy
of
the
slave
he
made
open
war
upon
and
is
daily
carrying
it
on
in
unremitted
efforts
can
any
one
imagine
then
that
the
slave
is
indebted
to
his
master
and
to
serve
whence
can
the
obligation
arise
what
is
it
founded
upon
what
is
my
duty
to
an
enemy
that
is
carrying
on
war
against
me
i
do
not
deny
but
in
some
circumstances
it
is
the
duty
of
the
slave
to
serve
but
it
is
a
duty
he
owes
himself
and
not
his
master
president
edwards
the
younger
said
in
a
sermon
preached
before
the
connecticut
abolition
society
thirty
years
ago
scarcely
a
man
in
this
country
thought
either
the
slave
trade
or
the
slavery
of
negroes
to
be
wrong
but
now
how
many
and
able
advocates
in
private
life
in
our
legislatures
in
congress
have
appeared
and
have
openly
and
irrefragably
pleaded
the
rights
of
humanity
in
this
as
well
as
other
instances
and
if
we
judge
of
the
future
by
the
past
fifty
years
from
this
time
it
will
be
as
shameful
for
a
man
to
hold
a
negro
slave
as
to
be
guilty
of
common
robbery

there
are

laws
for

which
neither

nor

have
at
present
but
which
is
more
than
that
they
and
at
a
period
not
remote
in

passed
her
celebrated

within
nine

he

been
frightened
by

ghost
as
that
the
grant
of

ought
in
any
degree
to
alarm
us
are
we
apprehensive
that

will
become
more
dangerous

are
we
alarmed

by
being
admitted
into

they
will
be
inspired
with
a
deadly
enmity
against
the

unaccountable
paradox
how
much
more
rational
would
it
be
to
argue
that
the
natural
enemy
of

of

is
he
who
is

before

said
the
idea
of
a
gradual
emancipation
and
removal
of

from

commonwealth
is
coeval
with
the
declaration
of
our
independence
from
the
british
yoke
it
sprung
into
existence
during
the
first
session
of

subsequent
to

senator
from

in

says
i
thought
till
very
lately
that
it
was
known
to
every
body
that
during
the
revolution
for
many
years
after
the
abolition
of
slavery
was
a
favorite
topic
with
many
of
our
ablest
who
entertained
with
respect
all
the
schemes
which
wisdom
or
ingenuity
could
suggest
for
accomplishing
the
object
wythe
to
the
day
of
his
death
for
a
simple
abolition
considering
the
objection
to
color
as
founded
in
by
degrees

were
abandoned

now

these
projects
revived
governor
barbour
of
virginia
in
his
speech
in
the
senate
on
the
missouri
question
said
we
are
asked
why
has
virginia
her
in
reference
to
slavery
that
the
sentiments
our
most
distinguished
for
thirty
years
with
the
course
which
the
friends
of
the
restriction
of
slavery
in
missouri
now
advocated
and
that
the
virginia
delegation
one
of
which
was
the
late
president
of
the
united
stance
voted
for
the
restriction
of
slavery
in
the
northwestern
territory
and
that
jefferson
has
delineated
a
gloomy
picture
of
the
baneful
effects
of
slavery
when
it
is
recollected
that
the
notes
of
jefferson
were
written
during
the
progress
of
the
revolution
it
is
no
matter
of
surprise
that
the
writer
should
have
imbibed
a
large
portion
of
that
enthusiasm
which
such
an
occasion
was
so
well
calculated
to
produce
as
to
the
consent
of
the
virginia
delegation
to
the
restriction
in
question
whether
the
result
of
a
disposition
to
restrain
the
slave
trade
indirectly
or
the
influence
of
that
to
which
i
have
just
alluded
it
is
not
now
important
to
decide
we
have
witnessed
its
effects
the
liberality
of
virginia
or
as
the
result
may
prove
her
folly
which
submitted
to
or
if
you
will
proposed
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
territory
has
eventuated
in
effects
which
speak
a
monitory
lesson
is
the
representation
from
this
quarter
on
the
present
question
imlay
in
his
early
history
of
kentucky
says
we
have
disgraced
the
fair
face
of
humanity
and
trampled
upon
the
sacred
privileges
of
man
at
the
very
moment
that
we
were
exclaiming
against
the
tyranny
of
your
the
english
ministry
but
in
contending
for
the
birthright
of
freedom
we
have
learned
to
feel
the
bondage
of
and
in
the
libations
we
offer
to
the
goddess
of
liberty
we
an
emancipation
of
the
slaves
of
this
as
honorable
to
themselves

neither

he
be

though
they
rose

some
of
the
points
established
by
the
testimony
are
the
universal
expectation
that
the
influence
of
congress
of
state
legislatures
of
seminaries
of
learning
of
churches
of
the
ministers
of
religion
and
of
public
sentiment
widely
embodied
in
abolition
societies
would
be
exerted
against
slavery
calling
forth
by
argument
and
appeal
the
moral
sense
of
the
nation
and
creating
a
power
of
opinion
that
would
abolish
the
system
throughout
the
union
in
a
word
that
free
speech
and
a
free
press
would
be
wielded
against
slavery
without
ceasing
and
without
restriction
full
well
did
the
south
know
not
only
that
the
national
government
would
probably
legislate
against
slavery
wherever
the
constitution
placed
it
within
its
reach
but
she
knew
also
that
congress
had
already
marked
out
the
line
of
national
policy
to
be
pursued
on
the
subject
had
committed
itself
before
the
world
to
a
course
of
action
against
slavery
wherever
she
could
move
upon
it
without
encountering
a
conflicting
jurisdiction
that
the
nation
had
established
by
solemn
ordinance
memorable
precedent
for
subsequent
action
by
abolishing
slavery
in
the
northwest
territory
and
by
declaring
that
it
should
never
thenceforward
exist
there
and
this
too
as
soon
as
by
cession
of
virginia
and
other
states
the
territory
came
under
congressional
control
the
south
knew
also
that
the
sixth
article
in
the
ordinance
prohibiting
slavery
was
first
proposed
by
the
largest
slaveholding
state
in
the
confederacy
that
the
chairman
of
the
committee
that
reported
the
ordinance
was
a
slaveholder
that
the
ordinance
was
enacted
by
congress
during
the
session
of
the
convention
that
formed
the
united
states
constitution
that
the
provisions
of
the
ordinance
were
both
while
in
prospect
and
when
under
discussion
matters
of
universal
notoriety
and
with
all
parties
and
when
finally
passed
received
the
vote
every
member
of
congress
from
each
of
the
slaveholding
the
south
also
had
every
reason
for
believing
that
the
first
congress
under
the
constitution
would
that
ordinance
as
it
unanimously
a
crowd
of
reflections
suggest
by
the
preceding
testimony
press
for
utterance
the
right
of
petition
ravished
and
trampled
by
its
constitutional
guardians
and
insult
and
defiance
hurled
in
the
faces
of
the
sovereign
people
while
calmly
remonstrating
servants
for
violence
committed
on
the
nation
charter
and
their
own
dearest
rights
add
to
this
the
right
of
peaceably
assembling
violently
wrested
the
rights
of
minorities
no
longer
free
speech
struck
dumb
free
outlawed
and
murdered
free
presses
cast
into
the
streets
and
their
fragments
strewed
with
shoutings
or
flourished
in
triumph
before
the
gaze
of
approving
crowds
as
proud
members
of
prostrate
law
the
spirit
and
power
of
our
fathers
where
are
they
their
deep
homage
always
and
every
where
rendered
to
free
thought
with
its
signs
free
speech
and
a
free
their
reverence
for
justice
liberty
and
law
where
are
they
but
we
turn
from
these
considerations
though
the
times
on
which
we
have
fallen
and
those
towards
which
we
are
borne
with
headlong
haste
call
for
their
discussion
as
with
the
voices
of
departing
life
and
proceed
to
topics
relevant
to
the
argument
before
us
the
seventh
article
of
the
amendments
to
the
constitution
is
alleged
to
withhold
from
congress
the
power
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
no
person
shall
be
deprived
of
life
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law
all
the
slaves
in
the
district
have
been
deprived
of
liberty
by
legislative
acts
now
these
legislative
acts
depriving
them
of
liberty
were
either
due
process
of
law
or
they
were
if
they
then
a
legislative
act
taking
from
the
master
that
property
which
is
the
identical
liberty
previously
taken
from
the
slave
would
be
due
process
of
law
and
of
course
a
act
but
if
the
legislative
acts
depriving
them
of
liberty
were
due
process
of
law
then
the
slaves
were
deprived
of
liberty
and
these
acts
are
in
that
case
the
emancipates
if
the
objector
reply
by
saying
that
the
import
of
the
phrase
due
process
of
law
is
process
solely
it
is
granted
and
that
fact
is
our
rejoinder
for
no
slave
in
the
district
been
deprived
of
his
liberty
by
a
judicial
process
or
in
other
words
by
due
process
of
law
consequently
upon
the
objector
own
admission
every
slave
in
the
district
has
been
deprived
of
liberty
and
is
therefore
by
the
this
is
asserted
only
of
the
slaves
under
the
exclusive
legislation
of
congress
the
last
clause
of
the
article
under
consideration
is
quoted
for
the
same
purpose
nor
shall
private
property
be
taken
for
public
use
without
just
compensation
each
of
the
state
constitutions
has
a
clause
of
similar
purport
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
district
by
congress
would
not
as
we
shall
presently
show
violate
this
clause
either
directly
or
by
implication
granting
for
argument
sake
that
slaves
are
private
property
and
that
to
emancipate
them
would
be
to
take
private
property
for
public
use
the
objector
admits
the
power
of
congress
to
do
provided
it
will
do
something
that
is
for
them
thus
instead
of
denying
the
objector
not
only
admits
but
it
as
the
ground
of
the
inference
that
compensation
must
accompany
it
so
far
from
disproving
the
existence
of
power
the
objector
asserts
the
existence
of
one
the
power
to
take
the
slaves
from
their
masters
the
other
the
power
to
take
the
property
of
the
united
states
to
pay
for
them
if
congress
can
not
constitutionally
impair
the
right
of
private
property
or
take
it
without
compensation
it
can
not
constitutionally
the
perpetration
of
such
acts
by
nor
those
who
commit
them
does
the
power
to
rob
a
man
of
his
earnings
rob
the
earner
of
his
to
them
who
has
a
better
right
to
the
than
the
producer
to
the
than
the
owner
of
the
to
the
hands
and
arms
than
he
from
whose
shoulders
they
swing
to
the
body
and
soul
than
he
whose
they
congress
not
only
impairs
but
annihilates
the
right
of
private
property
while
it
withholds
from
the
slaves
of
the
district
their
title
to
what
congress
powerless
to
protect
a
man
right
to
when
it
can
make
inviolable
the
right
to
a
but
waving
this
i
deny
that
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
district
would
violate
this
clause
what
does
the
clause
prohibit
the
taking
of
private
property
for
public
use
suppose
congress
should
emancipate
the
slaves
in
the
district
what
would
it
nothing
what
would
it
nothing
what
would
it
put
to
public
use
nothing
instead
of
private
property
congress
by
abolishing
slavery
would
say
private
property
shall
not
taken
and
those
who
have
been
robbed
of
it
already
shall
be
kept
out
of
it
no
longer
and
since
every
man
right
to
his
own
body
is
he
shall
be
protected
in
it
true
congress
may
not
arbitrarily
take
property
property
from
one
man
and
give
it
to
another
and
in
the
abolition
of
slavery
no
such
thing
is
done
a
legislative
act
changes
the
of
the
slave
makes
him
his
own
instead
of
the
property
of
another
it
determines
a
question
of
between
two
classes
of
persons
doing
an
act
of
justice
to
one
and
restraining
the
other
from
acts
of
injustice
or
in
other
words
preventing
one
from
robbing
the
other
by
granting
to
the
injured
party
the
protection
of
just
and
equitable
laws
congress
by
an
act
of
abolition
would
change
the
condition
of
seven
thousand
persons
in
the
district
but
would
take
nothing
to
construe
this
provision
so
as
to
enable
the
citizens
of
the
district
to
hold
as
property
and
in
perpetuity
whatever
they
please
or
to
hold
it
as
property
in
all
circumstances
all
necessity
public
welfare
and
the
will
and
power
of
the
government
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
is
a
total
perversion
of
its
whole
the
of
the
provision
was
to
throw
up
a
barrier
against
governmental
aggrandizement
the
right
to
take
property
for
is
one
thing
the
right
so
to
adjust
the
by
which
property
is
held
that
may
have
his
own
secured
to
is
another
thing
and
clearly
within
the
scope
of
legislation
besides
if
congress
were
to
take
the
slaves
in
the
district
it
would
be
not
abolishing
slavery
becoming
a
slaveholder
itself
instead
of
requiring
others
to
be
such
no
longer
the
clause
in
question
prohibits
the
taking
of
individual
property
for
public
uses
to
be
employed
or
disposed
of
property
for
governmental
purposes
congress
by
abolishing
slavery
in
the
district
would
do
no
such
thing
it
would
merely
change
the
of
that
which
has
been
recognised
as
a
qualified
property
by
congressional
acts
though
previously
declared
persons
by
the
constitution
more
than
this
is
done
continually
by
congress
and
every
other
legislature
property
the
most
absolute
and
unqualified
is
annihilated
by
legislative
acts
the
embargo
and
act
prostrated
at
a
stroke
a
forest
of
shipping
and
sank
millions
of
capital
to
say
nothing
of
the
power
of
congress
to
take
hundreds
of
millions
from
the
people
by
direct
taxation
who
doubts
its
power
to
abolish
at
once
the
whole
tariff
system
change
the
seat
of
government
arrest
the
progress
of
national
works
prohibit
any
branch
of
commerce
with
the
indian
tribes
or
with
foreign
nations
change
the
locality
of
forts
arsenals
magazines
dock
yards
to
abolish
the
post
office
system
the
privilege
of
patents
and
copyrights
by
such
acts
congress
might
in
the
exercise
of
its
acknowledged
powers
annihilate
property
to
an
incalculable
amount
and
that
without
becoming
liable
to
claims
for
compensation
finally
this
clause
prohibits
the
taking
for
public
use
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
does
not
recognise
slaves
as
property
any
where
and
it
does
not
recognise
them
in
in
the
district
of
columbia
all
allusions
to
them
in
the
constitution
recognise
them
as
persons
every
reference
to
them
points
to
the
element
of
and
thus
by
the
strongest
implication
declares
that
the
constitution
them
only
as
persons
and
not
recognise
them
in
any
other
light
if
they
escape
into
free
states
the
constitution
authorizes
their
being
taken
back
but
how
not
as
the
property
of
an
owner
but
as
persons
and
the
peculiarity
of
the
expression
is
a
marked
recognition
of
their
a
refusal
to
recognise
them
as
chattels
persons
to
service
are
to
service
that
can
be
affirmed
only
of
again
slaves
give
political
power
as
persons
the
constitution
in
settling
the
principle
of
representation
requires
their
enumeration
in
the
census
how
as
property
then
why
not
include
race
horses
and
game
cocks
slaves
like
other
inhabitants
are
enumerated
as
persons
so
by
the
constitution
the
government
was
pledged
to
with
the
migration
or
importation
of
such
as
the
states
might
think
proper
to
admit
until
and
authorized
the
laying
of
a
tax
on
each
person
so
admitted
further
slaves
are
recognized
as
persons
by
the
exaction
of
their
to
the
government
for
offences
against
the
government
slaves
are
tried
as
as
persons
they
are
entitled
to
counsel
for
their
defence
to
the
rules
of
evidence
and
to
due
process
of
the
law
and
as
they
are
punished
true
they
are
loaded
with
cruel
disabilities
in
courts
of
law
such
as
greatly
obstruct
and
often
inevitably
defeat
the
ends
of
justice
yet
they
are
still
recognised
as
even
in
the
legislation
of
congress
and
in
the
diplomacy
of
the
general
government
notwithstanding
the
frequent
and
wide
departures
from
the
integrity
of
the
constitution
on
this
subject
slaves
are
not
recognised
as
without
qualification
congress
has
always
refused
to
grant
compensation
for
slaves
killed
or
taken
by
the
enemy
even
when
these
slaves
had
been
impressed
into
the
united
service
in
half
a
score
of
cases
since
the
last
war
congress
has
rejected
such
applications
for
compensation
besides
both
in
congressional
acts
and
in
our
national
diplomacy
slaves
and
property
are
not
used
as
convertible
terms
when
mentioned
in
treaties
and
state
papers
it
is
in
such
a
way
as
to
distinguish
them
from
mere
property
and
generally
by
a
recognition
of
their
in
the
invariable
recognition
of
slaves
as
the
united
states
constitution
caught
the
mantle
of
the
glorious
declaration
and
most
worthily
wears
it
recognizes
all
human
beings
as
men
persons
and
thus
as
equals
in
the
original
draft
of
the
declaration
as
it
came
from
the
head
of
jefferson
it
is
alleged
that
great
britain
had
waged
a
cruel
war
against
nature
itself
violating
its
most
sacred
rights
of
life
and
liberty
in
the
persons
of
a
distant
people
carrying
them
into
slavery
determined
to
keep
up
a
market
where
men
should
be
bought
and
sold
thus
disdaining
to
make
the
charter
of
freedom
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
that
they
might
be
shorn
both
of
liberty
and
humanity
the
celebrated
roger
sherman
one
of
the
committee
of
five
appointed
to
draft
the
declaration
of
independence
and
also
a
member
of
the
convention
that
formed
the
united
states
constitution
said
in
the
first
congress
after
its
adoption
the
constitution
not
consider
these
slaves
a
species
of
lloyd
cong
reg
p
that
the
united
states
constitution
does
not
make
slaves
property
is
shown
in
the
fact
that
no
person
either
as
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
or
by
having
his
domicile
within
the
united
states
government
can
hold
slaves
he
can
hold
them
only
by
deriving
his
power
from
laws
or
from
the
law
of
congress
if
he
hold
slaves
within
the
district
but
no
person
resident
within
the
united
states
jurisdiction
and
within
the
district
nor
within
a
state
whose
laws
support
slavery
nor
held
to
service
under
the
laws
of
such
state
or
district
having
escaped
therefrom
be
held
as
a
men
can
hold
under
the
united
states
government
though
residing
beyond
the
bounds
of
any
state
district
or
territory
an
inhabitant
of
the
wisconsin
territory
can
hold
property
there
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
but
he
can
not
hold
there
under
the
united
states
laws
nor
by
virtue
of
the
united
states
constitution
nor
upon
the
ground
of
his
united
states
citizenship
nor
by
having
his
domicile
within
the
united
states
jurisdiction
the
constitution
no
where
recognizes
the
right
to
slave
property
merely
the
fact
that
the
states
have
jurisdiction
each
in
its
own
limits
and
that
there
are
certain
persons
within
their
jurisdictions
held
to
service
by
their
own
finally
in
the
clause
under
consideration
private
property
is
not
to
be
taken
without
compensation
just
if
justice
is
to
be
appealed
to
in
determining
the
amount
of
compensation
let
her
determine
the
also
if
it
be
her
province
to
say
compensation
is
just
it
is
hers
to
say
whether
is
just
whether
the
slave
is
just
property
rather
than
a
then
if
justice
adjudges
the
slave
to
be
private
property
it
adjudges
him
to
be
property
since
the
right
to
one
is
the
first
right
the
source
of
all
others
the
original
stock
by
which
they
are
accumulated
the
principal
of
which
they
are
the
interest
and
since
the
slave
private
property
has
been
taken
and
since
compensation
is
impossible
there
being
no
for
self
the
least
that
can
be
done
is
to
restore
to
him
his
original
private
property
having
shown
that
in
abolishing
slavery
property
would
not
be
taken
for
public
use
it
may
be
added
that
in
those
states
where
slavery
has
been
abolished
by
law
no
claim
for
compensation
has
been
allowed
indeed
the
manifest
absurdity
of
demanding
it
seems
to
have
quite
forestalled
the
of
such
a
claim
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
district
instead
of
being
a
legislative
anomaly
would
proceed
upon
the
principles
of
every
day
legislation
it
has
been
shown
already
that
the
united
states
constitution
does
not
recognize
slaves
as
property
yet
ordinary
legislation
is
full
of
precedents
showing
that
even
property
is
in
many
respects
wholly
subject
to
legislation
the
repeal
of
the
law
of
entailments
all
those
acts
that
control
the
alienation
of
property
its
disposal
by
will
its
passing
to
heirs
by
descent
with
the
question
who
shall
be
heirs
and
what
shall
be
the
rule
of
distribution
among
them
or
whether
property
shall
be
transmitted
at
all
by
descent
rather
than
escheat
to
the
state
these
with
statutes
of
limitation
and
various
other
classes
of
legislative
acts
serve
to
illustrate
the
acknowledged
scope
of
the
power
even
where
property
in
every
sense
persons
whose
property
is
thus
affected
by
public
laws
receive
from
the
government
no
compensation
for
their
losses
unless
the
state
has
been
put
into
possession
of
the
property
taken
from
them
the
preamble
of
the
united
states
constitution
declares
it
to
be
a
fundamental
object
of
the
organization
of
the
government
to
establish
justice
has
congress
to
do
that
for
which
it
was
made
the
of
can
not
the
united
states
government
fulfil
the
purpose
which
it
was
brought
into
to
abolish
slavery
is
to
take
from
no
rightful
owner
his
property
but
to
between
two
parties
to
emancipate
the
slave
is
to
between
him
and
his
master
to
throw
around
the
person
character
conscience
liberty
and
domestic
relations
of
the
one
same
that
secures
and
blesses
the
other
in
other
words
to
prevent
by
one
class
of
men
from
seizing
upon
another
class
and
robbing
them
at
pleasure
of
their
earnings
their
time
their
liberty
their
kindred
and
the
very
use
and
ownership
of
their
own
persons
finally
to
abolish
slavery
is
to
proclaim
and
that
innocence
and
helplessness
now
are
entitled
to
and
that
power
avarice
and
lust
shall
no
longer
gorge
upon
their
spoils
under
the
license
and
by
the
ministrations
of
congress
by
possessing
exclusive
legislation
in
all
cases
whatsoever
has
a
protective

all
the
inhabitants
of
the

if
it

no

all
admit
the
power
of

to
protect
the

in
the

against
their

what
part
of
the

gives
the
power
the
clause
so
often
quoted
power
of
legislation
in
all
cases
whatsoever
equally
in
the
of
defending
the

against
the
whites
as
in
that
of
defending
the
whites
against
the

the
power
is
given
also
by

a

if

it

fields
and

force
them
to
work
without

flog

imprison

where
would
congress
find
power

restrain
such
acts
answer
a

in
the

so
often
cited
and
an

in
that
cited

so
much
for
a
case
here
follows
a

the

these
identical
upon
seven
thousand
blacks
daily
that
congress
has
power
to
restrain
these
acts
in
one
case
all
assert
and
in
so
doing
they
assert
the
power
in
cases
whatsoever
for
the
grant
of
power
to
suppress
insurrections
is
an
grant
not
hampered
by
provisos
as
to
the
color
shape
size
sex
language
creed
or
condition
of
the
insurgents
congress
derives
its
power
to
suppress
this
insurrection
from
the
same
source
whence
it
derived
its
power
to
suppress
the
acts
in
the
case
if
one
case
is
an
insurrection
the
other
is
the
in
both
are
the
same
the
only
are
different
in
the
one
case
ignorant
and
degraded
goaded
by
the
memory
of
the
past
stung
by
the
present
and
driven
to
desperation
by
the
fearful
looking
for
of
wrongs
for
ever
to
come
in
the
other
enlightened
into
the
nature
of
the
principles
of
justice
and
the
dictates
of
the
law
of
love
unprovoked
by
wrongs
with
cool
deliberation
and
by
system
they
perpetrate
these
acts
upon
those
to
whom
they
owe
unnumbered
obligations
for
of
unrequited
service
on
which
side
may
palliation
be
pleaded
and
which
party
may
most
reasonably
claim
an
abatement
of
the
rigors
of
law
if
congress
has
power
to
suppress
such
acts
it
has
power
to
suppress
them
all
it
has
been
shown
already
that
is
exacted
of
the
slave
is
the
government
of
the
united
states
unable
to
grant
where
it
exacts
it
is
an
axiom
of
the
civilized
world
and
a
maxim
even
with
savages
that
allegiance
and
protection
are
reciprocal
and
correlative
are
principles
powerless
with
us
which
exact
homage
of
barbarians
is
constitutional
right
every
human
being
under
the
exclusive
legislation
of
congress
who
has
not
forfeited
it
by
in
conclusion
i
argue
the
power
of
congress
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
froth
art
sec
clause
of
the
constitution
congress
shall
have
power
to
provide
for
the
common
defence
and
the
general
welfare
of
the
united
states
has
the
government
of
the
united
states
no
power
under
this
grant
to
legislate
within
its
own
exclusive
jurisdiction
on
subjects
that
vitally
affect
its
interests
suppose
the
slaves
in
the
district
should
rise
upon
their
masters
and
the
united
states
government
in
quelling
the
insurrection
should
kill
any
number
of
them
could
their
masters
claim
compensation
of
the
government
manifestly
not
even
though
no
proof
existed
that
the
particular
slaves
killed
were
insurgents
this
was
precisely
the
point
at
issue
between
those
masters
whose
slaves
were
killed
by
the
state
troops
at
the
time
of
the
southampton
insurrection
and
the
virginia
legislature
no
evidence
was
brought
to
show
that
the
slaves
killed
by
the
troops
were
insurgents
yet
the
virginia
legislature
decided
that
their
masters
were
entitled
to
they
proceeded
on
the
sound
principle
that
a
government
may
in
self
protection
destroy
the
claim
of
its
subjects
even
to
that
which
has
been
recognised
as
property
by
its
own
acts
if
in
providing
for
the
common
defence
the
united
states
government
in
the
case
supposed
would
have
power
to
destroy
slaves
both
as
and
it
surely
might
stop
destroy
them
as
while
it
legalized
their
existence
as
and
thus
provided
for
the
common
defence
by
giving
them
a
personal
and
powerful
interest
in
the
government
and
securing
their
strength
for
its
defence
like
other
legislatures
congress
has
power
to
abate
nuisances
to
remove
or
tear
down
unsafe
buildings
to
destroy
infected
cargoes
to
lay
injunctions
upon
manufactories
injurious
to
the
public
health
and
thus
to
provide
for
the
common
defence
and
general
welfare
by
destroying
individual
property
when
it
puts
in
jeopardy
the
public
weal
granting
for
argument
sake
that
slaves
are
property
in
the
district
of
columbia
if
congress
has
a
right
to
annihilate
property
in
the
district
when
the
public
safety
requires
it
it
may
surely
annihilate
its
existence
property

win
their

by
emancipating

no

for

secret
foes
in

paralyzing

an
army
of

have
rallied
in

of
her
calamity
and
shouted
defiance
from
their
munitions
of

whilst
the
banner
of
the
republic
then
trampled
in
dust
would
have
floated
securely
over
freemen
exulting
amidst
bulwarks
of
strength
to
show
that
congress
can
abolish

power
to
provide

i
quote
an
extract
from
a
speech
of
madison
of
in
the
first
congress
under
the
constitution
may
speaking
of
the
abolition
of
the
slave
trade
madison
says
i
should
venture
to
say
it
is
as
much
for
the
interests
of
georgia
and
south
carolina
as
of
any
state
in
the
union
every
addition
they
receive
to
their
number
of
slaves
tends
to
them
and
renders
them
less
capable
of
in
case
of
hostilities
with
foreign
nations
they
will
be
the
means
of
attack
instead
of
repelling
invasion
it
is
a
necessary
duty
of
the
general
government
to
protect
every
part
of
the
empire
against
danger
as
well
as
external
thing
therefore
which
tends
to
increase
this
danger
though
it
may
be
a
local
affair
yet
if
it
involves
national
expense
or
safety
it
becomes
of
concern
to
every
part
of
the
union
and
is
a
proper
subject
for
the
consideration
of
those
charged
with
the
general
administration
of
the
see
cong
reg
vol
wythe
postscript
my
apology
for
adding
a
to
a
discussion
already
perhaps
too
protracted
is
the
fact
that
the
preceding
sheets
were
in
the
hands
of
the
printer
and
all
but
the
concluding
pages
had
gone
through
the
press
before
the
passage
of
calhoun
late
resolutions
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
a
proceeding
so
extraordinary
if
indeed
the
time
has
not
passed
when
acts
of
congress
in
derogation
of
freedom
and
in
deference
to
slavery
can
be
deemed
extraordinary
should
not
be
suffered
to
pass
in
silence
at
such
a
crisis
as
the
present
especially
as
the
passage
of
one
of
the
resolutions
by
a
vote
of
to
exhibits
a
shift
of
position
on
the
part
of
the
south
as
sudden
as
it
is
unaccountable
being
nothing
less
than
the
surrender
of
a
fortress
which
until
then
they
had
defended
with
the
pertinacity
of
a
blind
and
almost
infuriated
fatuity
upon
the
discussions
during
the
pendency
of
the
resolutions
and
upon
the
vote
by
which
they
were
carried
i
make
no
comment
save
only
to
record
my
exultation
in
the
fact
there
exhibited
that
great
emergencies
are
and
that
henceforward
until
this
question
is
settled
whoever
holds
a
seat
in
congress
will
find
upon
and
all
around
him
a
pressure
strong
enough
to
test
him
a
focal
blaze
that
will
find
its
way
through
the
carefully
adjusted
cloak
of
fair
pretension
and
the
sevenfold
brass
of
political
intrigue
and
piercing
to
the
dividing
asunder
of
joints
and
marrow
be
it
known
to
every
northern
man
who
aspires
to
a
seat
in
congress
that
hereafter
it
is
the
destiny
of
congressional
action
on
this
subject
to
be
a
mighty
revelator
making
secret
thoughts
public
property
and
proclaiming
on
the
what
is
whispered
in
the
ear
smiting
off
masks
and
bursting
open
sepulchres
beautiful
outwardly
and
heaving
up
to
the
sun
their
dead
men
bones
to
such
we
say
the
missouri
question
and
the
fate
of
those
who
then
sold
the
north
and
their
own
birthright
passing
by
the
resolutions
generally
without
remark
the
attention
of
the
reader
is
specially
solicited
to
clay
substitute
for
calhoun
fifth
resolution
resolved
that
when
the
district
of
columbia
was
ceded
by
the
states
of
virginia
and
maryland
to
the
united
states
domestic
slavery
existed
in
both
of
these
states
including
the
ceded
territory
and
that
as
it
still
continues
in
both
of
them
it
could
not
be
abolished
within
the
district
without
a
violation
of
that
good
faith
which
was
implied
in
the
cession
and
in
the
acceptance
of
the
territory
nor
unless
compensation
were
made
to
the
proprietors
of
slaves
without
a
manifest
infringement
of
an
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
nor
without
exciting
a
degree
of
just
alarm
and
apprehension
in
the
states
recognising
slavery
far
transcending
in
mischievous
tendency
any
possible
benefit
which
could
be
accomplished
by
the
abolition
by
voting
for
this
resolution
the
south
by
a
simultaneous
movement
shifted
its
mode
of
defence
not
so
much
by
taking
a
position
entirely
new
as
by
attempting
to
refortify
an
old
one
never
much
trusted
in
and
abandoned
mainly
long
ago
as
being
unable
to
hold
out
against
assault
however
unskilfully
directed
in
the
debate
on
this
resolution
though
the
southern
members
of
congress
did
not
retreat
from
the
ground
hitherto
maintained
by
them
that
congress
has
no
power
by
the
constitution
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
yet
in
the
main
they
silently
drew
off
from
it
the
passage
of
this
resolution
with
the
vote
of
every
southern
senator
forms
a
new
era
in
the
discussion
of
this
question
we
can
not
join
in
the
lamentations
of
those
who
bewail
it
we
hail
it
and
rejoice
in
it
it
was
as
we
would
have
had
it
offered
by
a
southern
senator
advocated
by
southern
senators
and
on
the
ground
that
it
was
no
compromise
that
it
embodied
the
true
southern
principle
that
this
resolution
stood
on
as
high
ground
as
mr
mr
preston
that
clay
resolution
was
as
strong
as
calhoun
rives
that
the
resolution
he
calhoun
now
refused
to
support
was
as
strong
as
his
own
and
that
in
supporting
it
there
was
no
abandonment
of
principle
by
the
mr
walker
of
mi
further
that
it
was
advocated
by
the
southern
senators
generally
as
an
expression
of
their
views
and
as
setting
the
question
of
slavery
in
the
district
on
its
ground
that
finally
when
the
question
was
taken
every
slaveholding
senator
including
calhoun
himself
voted
for
the
resolution
by
passing
this
resolution
and
with
such
avowals
the
south
has
surrendered
irrevocably
the
whole
question
at
issue
between
them
and
the
petitioners
for
abolition
in
the
district
it
has
unwittingly
but
explicitly
conceded
the
main
question
argued
in
the
preceding
pages
the
ground
taken
against
the
right
of
congress
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
is
that
slavery
existed
in
maryland
and
virginia
when
the
cession
was
made
and
it
still
continues
in
both
of
it
could
not
be
abolished
without
a
violation
of
that
good
faith
which
was
implied
in
the
cession
the
is
that
exclusive
has
no
power
to
abolish
slavery
within
its
jurisdiction
that
the
powers
of
even
can
not
do
it
nor
that
the
clause
granting
congress
exclusive
legislation
in
all
cases
whatsoever
over
such
district
gives
no
power
to
do
it
but
that
the
of
one
of
the
parties
that
the
other
would
not
in
cases
use
the
power
which
said
party
had
consented
be
used
in
all
cases
the
use
of
it
the
only
cardinal
point
in
the
discussion
is
here
not
only
but
formally
laid
down
by
the
south
as
the
leading
article
in
their
creed
on
the
question
of
congressional
jurisdiction
over
slavery
in
the
district
the
given
why
congress
should
not
abolish
and
the
sole
evidence
that
if
it
did
such
abolition
would
be
a
violation
of
good
faith
is
that
still
continues
in
those
thus
explicitly
admitting
that
if
slavery
did
still
continue
in
those
states
congress
abolish
it
in
the
district
the
same
admission
is
made
also
in
the
which
state
that
slavery
existed
in
those
states
the
time
of
the
admitting
that
if
it
had
existed
there
then
but
had
grown
up
in
the
district
under
congress
might
constitutionally
abolish
it
or
that
if
the
ceded
parts
of
those
states
had
been
the
parts
in
which
slaves
were
held
under
their
laws
congress
might
have
abolished
in
such
a
contingency
also
the
cession
in
that
case
leaving
no
slaves
in
those
states
no
good
faith
would
be
implied
in
it
nor
any
violated
by
an
act
of
abolition
the
principle
of
the
resolution
makes
this
further
admission
that
if
maryland
and
virginia
should
at
once
abolish
their
slavery
congress
might
at
once
abolish
it
in
the
district
the
principle
goes
even
further
than
this
and
congress
in
such
case
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
by
the
faith
in
the
cession
and
acceptance
of
the
territory
since
according
to
the
spirit
and
scope
of
the
resolution
this
implied
good
faith
of
maryland
and
virginia
in
making
the
cession
was
that
congress
would
do
nothing
within
the
district
which
should
go
to
counteract
the
policy
or
bring
into
disrepute
the
institutions
or
call
in
question
the
usages
or
even
in
any
way
ruffle
the
prejudices
of
those
states
or
do
what
might
think
would
unfavorably
bear
upon
their
interests
of
course
being
the
judges
but
let
us
dissect
another
limb
of
the
resolution
what
is
to
be
understood
by
that
good
faith
which
was
implied
it
is
of
course
an
admission
that
such
a
condition
was
not
in
the
acts
of
cession
that
in
their
there
is
nothing
restricting
the
power
of
congress
on
the
subject
of
slavery
in
the
district
not
a
alluding
to
it
nor
one
inserted
with
such
an
this
implied
faith
then
rests
on
no
clause
or
word
in
the
united
constitution
or
in
the
acts
of
cession
or
in
the
acts
of
congress
accepting
the
cession
nor
does
it
rest
on
any
declarations
of
the
legislatures
of
maryland
and
virginia
made
at
the
time
or
in
that
generation
nor
on
any
of
theirs
nor
on
any
declaration
of
the
of
those
states
nor
on
the
testimony
of
the
washingtons
jeffersons
madisons
chaces
martins
and
jennifers
of
those
states
and
times
the
assertion
rests
itself
alone
clay
and
the
other
senators
who
voted
for
the
resolution
that
maryland
and
virginia
that
congress
would
by
no
means
the
power
given
them
by
the
constitution
except
in
such
ways
as
would
be
well
pleasing
in
the
eyes
of
those
states
especially
as
one
of
them
was
the
ancient
dominion
and
now
after
the
lapse
of
half
a
century
this
of
maryland
and
virginia
the
existence
of
which
is
mere
matter
of
conjecture
with
the
senators
is
conjured
up
and
duly
installed
upon
the
of
final
appeal
before
whose
nod
constitutions
are
to
flee
away
and
with
whom
solemn
grants
of
power
and
explicit
guaranties
are
when
weighed
in
the
balance
altogether
lighter
than
vanity
but
let
us
survey
it
in
another
light
why
did
maryland
and
virginia
leave
so
much
to
be
why
did
they
not
in
some
way
what
lay
so
near
their
hearts
had
their
vocabulary
run
so
low
that
a
single
word
could
not
be
eked
out
for
the
occasion
or
were
those
states
so
bashful
of
a
sudden
that
they
dare
not
speak
out
and
tell
what
they
wanted
or
did
they
take
it
for
granted
that
congress
would
always
act
in
the
premises
according
to
their
wishes
and
that
too
without
their
their
wishes
if
as
honorable
senators
tell
us
maryland
and
virginia
did
verily
travail
with
such
abounding
why
brought
they
forth
no
it
is
as
true
in
as
in
religion
that
the
only
of
faith
is
and
that
faith
works
is
has
no
power
but
here
forsooth
a
blind
implication
with
nothing
an
implied
without
works
is
clay
is
lawyer
enough
to
know
that
even
a
as
to
must
have
been
the
of
maryland
and
virginia
about
congressional
exercise
of
constitutional
power
no
and
that
to
plead
it
in
a
court
of
law
would
be
of
small
service
except
to
jostle
their
honors
gravity
he
need
not
be
told
that
the
constitution
gives
congress
power
to
exercise
exclusive
legislation
in
all
cases
whatsoever
over
such
district
nor
that
the
legislatures
of
maryland
and
virginia
constructed
their
acts
of
cession
with
this
clause
their
and
that
both
of
them
declared
those
acts
made
in
of
said
clause
those
states
were
aware
that
the
united
states
in
their
constitution
had
left
nothing
to
be
as
to
the
power
of
congress
over
the
district
an
admonition
quite
sufficient
one
would
think
to
put
them
on
their
guard
and
induce
them
to
eschew
vague
implications
and
resort
to
full
well
did
they
know
also
that
these
were
times
when
in
matters
of
high
import
was
left
to
be
implied
the
colonies
were
then
panting
from
a
twenty
years
conflict
with
the
mother
country
about
bills
of
rights
charters
treaties
constitutions
grants
limitations
and
of
the
severities
of
a
long
and
terrible
discipline
had
taught
them
to
guard
at
all
points
that
their
exact
import
and
limit
might
be
leaving
no
scope
for
a
blind
faith
that
in
the
lottery
of
chances
there
would
be
no
blanks
but
making
all
sure
by
the
use
of
explicit
terms
and
wisely
chosen
words
and
of
them
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
with
its
amendments
those
of
the
individual
states
the
national
treaties
the
public
documents
of
the
general
and
state
governments
at
that
period
show
the
universal
conviction
of
legislative
bodies
that
when
great
public
interests
were
at
stake
nothing
should
be
left
to
be
implied
further
suppose
maryland
and
virginia
had
expressed
their
implied
faith
in
and
embodied
it
in
their
acts
of
cession
as
a
proviso
declaring
that
congress
should
not
exercise
exclusive
legislation
in
cases
whatsoever
over
the
district
but
that
the
case
of
should
be
an
exception
who
does
not
know
that
congress
if
it
had
accepted
the
cession
on
those
terms
would
have
violated
the
constitution
and
who
that
has
ever
studied
the
free
mood
of
those
times
in
its
bearings
on
slavery
proofs
of
which
are
given
in
scores
on
the
preceding
pages
can
for
an
instant
believe
that
the
people
of
the
united
states
would
have
altered
their
constitution
for
the
purpose
of
providing
for
slavery
an
inviolable
sanctuary
that
when
driven
in
from
its
outposts
and
everywhere
retreating
discomfited
before
the
march
of
freedom
it
might
be
received
into
everlasting
habitations
on
the
common
homestead
and
of
this
free
republic
besides
who
can
believe
that
virginia
made
such
a
condition
or
cherished
such
a
purpose
when
at
that
very
moment
washington
jefferson
wythe
patrick
henry
george
tucker
and
almost
all
her
illustrious
men
were
advocating
the
abolition
of
slavery
by
law
when
washington
had
said
two
years
before
maryland
and
virginia
must
have
laws
for
the
gradual
abolition
of
slavery
and
at
a
period
and
when
jefferson
in
his
letter
to
price
three
years
before
the
cession
had
said
speaking
of
virginia
this
is
the
next
state
to
which
we
may
turn
our
eyes
for
the
interesting
spectacle
of
justice
in
conflict
with
avarice
and
oppression
a
conflict
in
which
the
sacred
side
is
gaining
daily
recruits
when
voluntary
emancipations
on
the
soil
were
then
progressing
at
the
rate
of
between
one
and
two
thousand
annually
see
judge
tucker
dissertation
on
slavery
when
the
public
sentiment
of
virginia
had
undergone
and
was
undergoing
so
mighty
a
revolution
that
the
idea
of
the
continuance
of
slavery
as
a
permanent
system
could
not
be
though
she
then
contained
about
half
the
slaves
in
the
union
was
this
the
time
to
stipulate
for
the
of
slavery
under
the
exclusive
legislation
of
congress
and
that
too
at
the
session
of
congress
when
of
her
delegation
voted
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
north
west
territory
a
territory
which
she
had
herself
ceded
to
congress
and
along
with
it
had
surrendered
her
jurisdiction
over
many
of
her
citizens
inhabitants
of
that
territory
who
held
slaves
there
and
whose
slaves
were
emancipated
by
that
act
of
congress
in
which
all
her
delegation
with
one
accord
participated
now
in
view
of
the
universal
belief
then
prevalent
that
slavery
in
this
country
was
doomed
to
short
life
and
especially
that
in
maryland
and
virginia
it
would
be
abolished
are
we
to
be
told
that
these
states
to
bind
congress
to
terminate
it
are
we
to
adopt
the
monstrous
conclusion
that
this
was
the
of
the
ancient
dominion
thus
to
the
united
states
by
an
implied
faith
and
that
when
the
united
states
the
cession
she
did
solemnly
thus
plight
her
troth
and
that
virginia
did
then
so
it
verily
one
would
think
that
honorable
senators
supposed
themselves
deputed
to
do
our
as
well
as
our
legislation
or
rather
that
they
themselves
were
absolved
from
such
drudgery
by
virtue
of
their
office
another
absurdity
of
this
dogma
about
implied
faith
is
that
where
there
was
no
power
to
exact
an
pledge
there
was
none
to
demand
an
one
and
where
there
was
no
power
to
the
one
there
was
none
to
give
the
we
have
shown
already
that
congress
could
not
have
accepted
the
cession
with
such
a
condition
to
have
signed
away
a
part
of
its
constitutional
grant
of
power
would
have
been
a
of
the
constitution
further
the
congress
which
accepted
the
cession
was
competent
to
pass
a
resolution
pledging
itself
not
to
the
power
over
the
district
committed
to
it
by
the
constitution
but
here
its
power
ended
its
resolution
would
only
bind
could
it
bind
the
congress
by
its
authority
could
the
members
of
one
congress
say
to
the
members
of
another
because
we
do
not
choose
to
exercise
all
the
authority
vested
in
us
by
the
constitution
therefore
you
not
this
would
have
been
a
prohibition
to
do
what
the
constitution
gives
power
to
do
each
successive
congress
would
still
have
gone
to
the
constitution
for
its
power
brushing
away
in
its
course
the
cobwebs
stretched
across
its
path
by
the
officiousness
of
an
impertinent
predecessor
again
the
legislatures
of
virginia
and
maryland
had
no
power
to
bind
congress
either
by
an
express
or
an
implied
pledge
never
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
those
legislatures
had
no
power
to
bind
never
to
abolish
slavery
within
their
own
territories
the
ceded
parts
included
where
then
would
they
get
power
to
bind
not
to
do
what
they
had
no
power
to
bind
themselves
not
to
do
if
a
legislature
could
not
in
this
respect
control
the
successive
legislatures
of
its
own
state
could
it
control
the
successive
congresses
of
the
united
states
but
perhaps
we
shall
be
told
that
the
implied
faith
in
the
acts
of
cession
of
maryland
and
virginia
was
that
congress
should
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
but
that
it
should
not
do
it
until
had
done
it
within
their
bounds
verily
this
faith
comes
little
short
of
the
faith
of
miracles
a
good
rule
that
works
both
ways
first
maryland
and
virginia
have
good
faith
that
congress
will
abolish
until
do
and
then
just
as
good
faith
that
congress
abolish
they
do
excellently
accommodated
did
those
states
suppose
that
congress
would
legislate
over
the
national
domain
the
common
jurisdiction
of
for
maryland
and
virginia
alone
and
who
did
they
suppose
would
be
judges
in
the
matter
themselves
merely
or
the
whole
union
this
good
faith
implied
in
the
cession
is
no
longer
of
doubtful
interpretation
the
principle
at
the
bottom
of
it
when
fairly
stated
is
this
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
are
bound
in
good
faith
to
do
in
the
district
of
columbia
without
demurring
just
what
and
when
maryland
and
virginia
do
in
their
own
states
in
short
that
the
general
government
is
eased
of
all
the
burdens
of
legislation
within
its
exclusive
jurisdiction
save
that
of
hiring
a
scrivener
to
copy
off
the
acts
of
the
maryland
and
virginia
legislatures
as
fast
as
they
are
passed
and
engross
them
under
the
title
of
laws
of
the
united
states
for
the
district
of
columbia
a
slight
additional
expense
would
also
be
incurred
in
keeping
up
an
express
between
the
capitols
of
those
states
and
washington
city
bringing
congress
from
time
to
time
its
from
head
quarters
instructions
not
to
be
disregarded
without
a
violation
of
that
good
faith
implied
in
the
cession
this
sets
in
strong
light
the
advantages
of
our
glorious
union
if
the
doctrine
of
clay
and
the
senators
be
orthodox
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
been
permitted
to
set
up
at
their
own
expense
and
on
their
own
territory
two
great
called
senate
chamber
and
representatives
hall
for
the
purpose
of
sending
abroad
by
authority
of
legislation
permitted
also
to
keep
in
their
pay
a
corps
of
pliant
musicians
with
peremptory
instructions
to
sound
on
any
line
of
the
staff
according
as
virginia
and
maryland
may
give
the
key
note
though
this
may
have
the
seeming
of
mere
raillery
yet
an
analysis
of
the
resolution
and
of
the
discussions
upon
it
will
convince
every
fair
mind
that
it
is
but
the
legitimate
carrying
out
of
the
pervading
both
they
proceed
virtually
upon
the
hypothesis
that
the
will
and
pleasure
of
virginia
and
maryland
are
to
those
of
the
if
the
main
design
of
setting
apart
a
federal
district
had
been
originally
the
accommodation
of
maryland
virginia
and
the
south
with
the
united
states
as
an
to
consummate
the
object
there
could
hardly
have
been
higher
assumption
or
louder
vaunting
the
sole
object
of
such
a
district
was
in
effect
totally
perverted
in
the
resolution
of
clay
and
in
the
discussions
of
the
entire
southern
delegation
upon
its
passage
instead
of
taking
the
ground
that
the
benefit
of
the
whole
union
was
the
sole
of
a
federal
district
that
it
was
designed
to
guard
and
promote
the
interests
of
the
states
and
that
it
was
to
be
legislated
over
this
the
resolution
proceeds
upon
an
hypothesis
the
it
takes
a
single
point
of
policy
and
exalts
it
above
national
interests
utterly
overshadowing
them
abrogating
national
making
void
a
clause
of
the
constitution
humbling
the
general
government
into
a
subject
crouching
for
favors
to
a
superior
and
that
too
its
own
exclusive
all
the
attributes
of
sovereignty
vested
in
congress
by
the
constitution
it
impales
upon
the
point
of
an
alleged
and
this
is
clay
to
appease
the
lust
of
power
and
the
ravenings
of
state
encroachment
a
forsooth
that
sinks
the
general
government
on
own
into
a
mere
colony
with
virginia
and
maryland
for
its
mother
country
it
is
refreshing
to
turn
from
these
shallow
distorted
constructions
and
servile
cringings
to
the
high
bearing
of
other
southern
men
in
other
times
men
who
in
their
character
of
legislators
and
lawyers
disdained
to
accommodate
their
interpretations
of
constitutions
and
charters
to
geographical
lines
or
to
bend
them
to
the
purposes
of

political
canvass

hon

of

the

is

from

effect
congress
is
responsible
to
the
states
and
to
the
people
for
that
legislation
it
is
in
truth
the
legislation
of
the
states
over
a
district
placed
under
their
control
for
own
not
for
that
of
the
district
except
as
the
prosperity
of
the
district
is
involved
and
necessary
to
the
life
of
pinkney
p
the
profound
legal
opinion
from
which
this
is
an
extract
was
elaborated
at
great
length
many
years
since
by
a
number
of
the
most
distinguished
lawyers
in
the
united
states
whose
signatures
are
appended
to
it
it
is
specific
and
to
the
point
it
asserts
that
congressional
legislation
over
the
district
is
the
legislation
of
the
and
the
not
of
states
and
a
mere
of
the
people
over
a
district
placed
under
control
under
the
control
of
the
of
the
states
not
under
the
control
of
of
them
that
it
was
thus
put
under
their
control
their
own
the
benefit
of
the
states
not
to
secure
special
benefits
to
maryland
and
virginia
or
what
it
might
be
they
would
regard
as
benefits
it
concludes
by
asserting
that
the
design
of
this
exclusive
control
of
congress
over
the
district
was
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
except
as
that
is
with
and
means
of
the
advantage
if
this
is
the
case
with
the
which
is
concerned
it
is
so
with
maryland
and
virginia
who
are
but
interested
and
would
be
but
remotely
affected
by
it
the
argument
of
madison
in
the
congress
of
an
extract
from
which
has
been
given
on
a
preceding
page
lays
down
the
same
principle
that
though
any
matter
be
a
local
affair
yet
if
it
involves
expense
or
safety
becomes
of
concern
to
every
part
of
the
union
and
is
a
proper
subject
for
the
consideration
of
those
charged
with
the
general
administration
of
the
cong
reg
vol
but
these
are
only
the
initiatory
absurdities
of
this
good
faith
the
senators
aptly
illustrate
the
principle
that
error
not
only
conflicts
with
truth
but
is
generally
at
issue
with
itself
for
if
it
would
be
a
violation
of
good
faith
to
maryland
and
virginia
for
congress
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
it
would
be
a
violation
for
congress
to
do
it
the
or
even
at
the
earnest
and
unanimous
petition
of
the
people
of
the
district
yet
for
years
it
has
been
the
southern
doctrine
that
if
the
people
of
the
district
demand
of
congress
relief
in
this
respect
it
has
power
as
their
local
legislature
to
grant
it
and
by
abolishing
slavery
there
carry
out
the
will
of
the
citizens
but
now
new
light
has
broken
in
the
optics
of
the
have
pierced
the
millstone
with
a
deeper
insight
and
discoveries
thicken
faster
than
they
can
be
telegraphed
congress
has
no
power
o
no
not
a
modicum
to
help
the
slaveholders
of
the
district
however
loudly
they
may
clamor
for
it
the
southern
doctrine
that
congress
is
to
the
district
a
mere
local
legislature
to
do
its
pleasure
is
tumbled
from
the
genitive
into
the
vocative
hard
fate
and
that
too
at
the
hands
of
those
who
begat
it
the
reasonings
of
pinckney
wise
and
leigh
are
now
found
to
be
wholly
at
fault
and
the
chanticleer
rhetoric
of
glascock
and
garland
stalks
featherless
and
for
clay
resolution
sweeps
by
the
board
all
those
stereotyped
as
congress
a
local
legislature
consent
of
the
district
bound
to
consult
the
wishes
of
the
district
which
for
the
last
two
sessions
of
congress
have
served
to
eke
out
scanty
supplies
it
declares
that
slavery
existed
in
maryland
and
virginia
at
the
time
of
the
cession
and
as
it
still
continues
in
both
those
states
it
could
not
be
abolished
in
the
district
without
a
violation
of
good
but
let
us
see
where
this
principle
of
the
will
lead
us
if
implied
faith
to
maryland
and
virginia
congress
from
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
district
it
congress
to
do
in
the
district
what
those
states
have
done
within
their
bounds
restrain
from
abolishing
it
upon
the
same
principle
congress
is
by
the
doctrine
of
clay
resolution
to
within
the
district
there
is
no
for
this
plighted
faith
congress
must
not
only
refrain
from
laying
violent
hands
on
slavery
and
see
to
it
that
the
slaveholders
themselves
do
not
but
it
is
bound
to
keep
the
system
up
to
the
maryland
and
virginia
standard
of
vigor
again
if
the
good
faith
of
congress
to
virginia
and
maryland
requires
that
slavery
should
exist
in
the
district
while
it
exists
in
those
states
it
requires
that
it
should
exist
there
it
exists
in
those
states
if
to
abolish
form
of
slavery
in
the
district
would
violate
good
faith
to
abolish
form
existing
in
those
states
and
to
substitute
a
totally
different
one
would
also
violate
it
the
congressional
good
faith
is
to
be
kept
not
only
with
but
with
the
and
virginia
of
slavery
the
faith
of
those
states
not
being
in
the
preservation
of
system
but
of
system
otherwise
congress
instead
of
would
counteract
their
policy
principles
would
be
brought
into
action
there
conflicting
with
their
system
and
thus
the
true
spirit
of
the
implied
pledge
would
be
violated
on
this
principle
so
long
as
slaves
are
chattels
personal
in
virginia
and
maryland
congress
could
not
make
them
inseparable
from
the
soil
as
in
louisiana
nor
could
it
permit
slaves
to
read
nor
to
worship
god
according
to
conscience
nor
could
it
grant
them
trial
by
jury
nor
legalize
marriage
nor
require
the
master
to
give
sufficient
food
and
clothing
nor
prohibit
the
violent
sundering
of
families
because
such
provisions
would
conflict
with
the
existing
slave
laws
of
virginia
and
maryland
and
thus
violate
the
good
faith
implied
so
the
principle
of
the
resolution
binds
congress
in
all
these
particulars
not
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
virginia
and
maryland
abolish
not
to
abolish
any
of
it
that
exists
in
those
states
not
to
abolish
any
or
of
it
still
existing
in
those
states
when
they
do
to
increase
or
abate
its
rigor
and
the
same
are
modified
by
those
states
in
a
word
congressional
action
in
the
district
is
to
float
passively
in
the
wake
of
legislative
action
on
the
subject
in
those
states
but
here
comes
a
dilemma
suppose
the
legislation
of
those
states
should
steer
different
courses
then
there
would
be
wakes
can
congress
float
in
both
yea
verily
nothing
is
too
hard
for
it
its
obsequiousness
equals
its
power
of
legislation
in
cases
whatsoever
it
can
float
on
the
virginia
tide
and
ebb
down
on
the
maryland
at
the
same
time
what
maryland
does
congress
will
do
in
the
maryland
part
what
virginia
does
congress
will
do
in
the
virginia
part
though
congress
might
not
always
be
able
to
run
at
the
bidding
of
both
especially
in
different
directions
yet
if
it
obeyed
orders
cheerfully
and
kept
in
its
place
according
to
its
good
faith
implied
impossibilities
might
not
be
rigidly
exacted
true
we
have
the
highest
sanction
for
the
maxim
that
no
can
serve
two
masters
but
if
corporations
have
souls
analogy
would
absolve
congress
on
that
score
or
at
most
give
it
only
very
small
not
large
enough
to
be
at
all
in
the
way
as
an
to
the
universal
rule
laid
down
to
the
maxim
in
following
out
the
absurdities
of
this
good
faith
it
will
be
seen
at
once
that
the
doctrine
of
clay
resolution
extends
to
the
of
existing
in
maryland
and
virginia
which
exist
also
within
the
district
every
system
institution
law
and
established
usage
there
is
placed
beyond
congressional
control
equally
with
slavery
and
by
the
same
implied
faith
the
abolition
of
the
lottery
system
in
the
district
as
an
was
a
flagrant
breach
of
this
good
faith
to
maryland
and
virginia
as
the
system
still
continued
in
those
states
so
to
abolish
imprisonment
for
debt
and
capital
punishment
to
remodel
the
bank
system
the
power
of
corporations
the
militia
law
laws
of
limitation
in
the
district
virginia
and
maryland
took
the
would
violate
the
good
faith
implied
in
the
cession
that
in
the
acts
of
cession
no
such
good
faith
was
implied
by
virginia
and
maryland
as
is
claimed
in
the
resolution
we
argue
from
the
fact
that
in
virginia
ceded
to
the
united
states
all
her
northwest
territory
with
the
special
proviso
that
her
citizens
inhabiting
that
territory
should
have
their
and
confirmed
to
them
and
be
in
the
enjoyment
of
their
and
liberties
see
journals
of
congress
vol
p
the
cession
was
made
in
the
form
of
a
deed
and
signed
by
thomas
jefferson
samuel
hardy
arthur
lee
and
james
monroe
many
of
these
inhabitants
three
years
after
the
cession
the
virginia
delegation
in
congress
the
passage
of
an
ordinance
which
should
abolish
slavery
in
that
territory
and
declare
that
it
should
never
thereafter
exist
there
all
the
members
of
congress
from
virginia
and
maryland
voted
for
this
ordinance
suppose
some
member
of
congress
had
during
the
passage
of
the
ordinance
introduced
the
following
resolution
resolved
that
when
the
northwest
territory
was
ceded
by
virginia
to
the
united
states
domestic
slavery
existed
in
that
state
including
the
ceded
territory
and
as
it
still
continues
in
that
state
it
could
not
be
abolished
within
the
territory
without
a
violation
of
that
good
faith
which
was
implied
in
the
cession
and
in
the
acceptance
of
the
territory
what
would
have
been
the
indignant
response
of
grayson
griffin
madison
and
the
lees
in
the
congress
of
to
such
a
resolution
and
of
carrington
chairman
of
the
committee
who
reported
the
ratification
of
the
ordinance
in
the
congress
of
and
of
page
and
parker
who
with
every
other
member
of
the
virginia
delegation
supported
it
but
to
enumerate
all
the
absurdities
into
which
the
senators
have
plunged
themselves
would
be
to
make
a
quarto
inventory
we
decline
the
task
and
in
conclusion
merely
add
that
clay
in
presenting
this
resolution
and
each
of
the
senators
who
voted
for
it
entered
on
the
records
of
the
senate
and
proclaimed
to
the
world
a
most
unworthy
accusation
against
the
millions
of
american
citizens
who
have
during
nearly
half
a
century
petitioned
the
national
legislature
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
of
colombia
charging
them
either
with
the
ignorance
or
the
impiety
of
praying
the
nation
to
violate
its
plighted
faith
the
resolution
virtually
indicts
at
the
bar
of
public
opinion
and
brands
with
odium
all
the
manumission
societies
the
petitioners
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
district
and
for
a
long
time
the
only
ones
petitioning
from
year
to
year
through
evil
report
and
good
report
still
petitioning
by
individual
societies
and
in
their
national
conventions
but
as
if
it
were
not
enough
to
table
the
charge
against
such
men
as
benjamin
rush
william
rawle
john
sergeant
robert

cadwallader

their
chief

and
judges
even
the
sovereign
states
of
pennsylvania

whose
legislatures
have
either
memorialized
congress
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district

instructed
their
senators

a
measure

be
gravely
informed
by
clay
norvell

smith

black
tipton
and
other
honorable
senators
either
that
their
perception
is
so
dull
they
know
not
whereof
they
affirm
or
that
their
moral
sense
is
so
blunted
they
can
demand
without
compunction
a
violation
of
the
nation
faith
we
have
spoken
already
of
the
concessions
unwittingly
made
in
this
resolution
to
the
true
doctrine
of
congressional
power
over
the
district
for
that
concession
important
as
it
is
we
have
small
thanks
to
render
that
such
a
resolution
passed
with
such
an
and
pressing
at
a
thousand
points
on
relations
and
interests
vital
to
the
free
states
should
be
hailed
as
it
has
been
by
a
portion
of
the
northern
press
as
a
compromise
originating
in
deference
to
northern
interests
and
to
be
received
by
us
as
a
offering
of
disinterested
benevolence
demanding
our
gratitude
to
the
mover
may
well
cover
us
with
shame
we
deserve
the
humiliation
and
have
well
earned
the
mockery
let
it
come
if
after
having
been
set
up
at
auction
in
the
public
of
the
nation
and
for
thirty
years
and
by
each
of
a
score
of
compromises
treacherously
knocked
off
to
the
lowest
bidder
and
that
without
money
and
without
price
the
north
plundered
and
betrayed
in
this
her
accepted
time
consider
the
things
that
belong
to
her
peace
before
they
are
hidden
from
her
eyes
then
let
her
eat
of
the
fruit
of
her
own
way
and
be
filled
with
her
own
devices
let
the
shorn
and
blinded
giant
grind
in
the
of
the
philistines
till
taught
the
folly
of
intrusting
to
delilahs
the
secret
and
the
custody
of
his
strength
have
the
free
states
bound
themselves
by
an
oath
never
to
profit
by
the
lessons
of
experience
if
lost
to
are
they
dead
to
also
can
nothing
rouse
them
to
cast
about
for
self
preservation
and
shall
a
life
of
tame
surrenders
be
terminated
by
suicidal
sacrifice
a
compromise
bitter
irony
is
the
plucked
and
north
to
be
wheedled
by
the
sorcery
of
another
missouri
compromise
a
compromise
in
which
the
south
gained
all
and
the
north
lost
all
and
lost
it
for
ever
a
compromise
which
embargoed
the
free
laborer
of
the
north
and
west
and
clutched
at
the
staff
he
leaned
upon
to
turn
it
into
a
bludgeon
and
fell
him
with
its
stroke
a
compromise
which
wrested
from
liberty
her
boundless
birthright
domain
stretching
westward
to
the
sunset
while
it
gave
to
slavery
loose
reins
and
a
free
course
from
the
mississippi
to
the
pacific
the
resolution
as
it
finally
passed
is
here
inserted
the
original
resolution
as
moved
by
clay
was
inserted
at
the
head
of
this
postscript
with
the
impression
that
it
was
the
form
it
will
be
seen
however
that
it
underwent
no
material
modification
resolved
that
the
interference
by
the
citizens
of
any
of
the
states
with
the
view
to
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
district
is
endangering
the
rights
and
security
of
the
people
of
the
district
and
that
any
act
or
measure
of
congress
designed
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
would
be
a
violation
of
the
faith
implied
in
the
cessions
by
the
states
of
virginia
and
maryland
a
just
cause
of
alarm
to
the
people
of
the
slaveholding
states

laws
the
power
every
where
is
subject
to
restrictions
whether
limited
by
constitutions
or
not
no
legislature
can
authorize
murder
nor
make
honesty
penal
nor
virtue
a
crime
nor
exact
impossibilities
in
these
and
similar
respects
the
power
of
congress
is
held
in
check
by
principles
existing
in
the
nature
of
things
not
imposed
by
the
constitution
but
presupposed
and
assumed
by
it
the
power
of
congress
over
the
district
is
restricted
only
by
those
principles
that
limit
ordinary
legislation
and
in
some
respects
it
has
even
wider
scope
in
common
with
the
legislatures
of
the
states
congress
can
not
constitutionally
pass
ex
post
facto
laws
in
criminal
cases
nor
suspend
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
nor
pass
a
bill
of

nor
abridge

of

of

nor
invade

of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
persons
houses
papers
and
effects
nor
enact
laws
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
these
are
general
limitations
congress
can
not
do
these
things
the
exact
import
therefore
of
the
clause
in
all
cases
whatsoever
is
all
subjects
within
the
appropriate
sphere
of
some
legislatures
are
restrained
by
constitutions
from
the
exercise
of
powers
strictly
within
the
proper
sphere
of
legislation
congressional
power
over
the
district
has
no
such
restraint
it
traverses
the
whole
field
of
legitimate
legislation
all
the
power
which
any
legislature
has
within
its
own
jurisdiction
congress
holds
over
the
district
of
columbia
it
has
been
objected
that
the
clause
in
question
respects
merely
police
regulations
and
that
its
sole
design
was
to
enable
congress
to
protect
itself
against
popular
tumults
but
if
the
convention
that
framed
the
constitution
aimed
to
provide
for
a
case
only
why
did
they
provide
for
cases
whatsoever
besides
this
clause
was
opposed
in
many
of
the
state
conventions
because
the
grant
of
power
was
not
restricted
to
police
regulations
in
the
virginia
convention
george
mason
the
father
of
the
virginia
constitution
patrick
henry
grayson
and
others
assailed
it
on
that
ground
mason
said
this
clause
gives
an
unlimited
authority
in
every
possible
case
within
the
district
he
would
willingly
give
them
exclusive
power
as
far
as
respected
the
police
and
good
government
of
the
place
but
he
would
give
them
no
more
grayson
said
that
control
over
the
was
and
that
the
continental
congress
never
had
an
idea
of
exclusive
legislation
in
all
cases
patrick
henry
said
is
it
consistent
with
any
principle
of
prudence
or
good
policy
to
grant
unbounded
authority
madison
said
in
reply
i
did
conceive
that
the
clause
under
consideration
was
one
of
those
parts
which
would
speak
its
own
praise
when
any
power
is
given
its
delegation
necessarily
involves
authority
to
make
laws
to
execute
it
the
powers
which
are
found
necessary
to
be
given
are
therefore
delegated
and
particular
and
minute
specification
is
left
to
the
legislature
it
is
not
within
the
limits
of
human
capacity
to
delineate
on
paper
all
those
particular
cases
and
circumstances
in
which
legislation
by
the
general
legislature
would
be
necessary
governor
randolph
said
holland
has
no
ten
miles
square
but
she
has
the
hague
where
the
deputies
of
the
states
assemble
but
the
influence
which
it
has
given
the
province
of
holland
to
have
the
seat
of
government
within
its
territory
subject
in
some
respects
to
its
control
has
been
injurious
to
the
other
provinces
the
wisdom
of
the
convention
is
therefore
manifest
in
granting
to
congress
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
place
of
their
session
p
in
the
number
of
the
federalist
madison
says
the
indispensable
necessity
of
authority
at
the
seat
of
government
carries
its
own
evidence
with
it
finally
that
the
grant
in
question
is
to
be
interpreted
according
to
the
obvious
import
of
its
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
virginia
proposed
an
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
at
the
time
of
its
adoption
providing
that
this
clause
should
be
so
construed
as
to
give
power
only
over
the
and
good
of
said
district
amendment
was
the
former
part
of
the
clause
under
consideration
congress
shall
have
power
to
exercise
legislation
gives
jurisdiction
and
the
latter
part
in
all
cases
whatsoever
defines
the
of
it
since
then
congress
is
the
legislature
within
the
district
and
since
its
power
is
limited
only
by
the
checks
common
to
all
legislatures
it
follows
that
what
the
power
is
intrinsically
competent
to
do
where
congress
is
competent
to
do
in
the
district
of
columbia
having
disposed
of
preliminaries
we
proceed
to
state
and
argue
the
at
issue
is
the
power
competent
to
abolish
slavery
when
not
restricted
in
that
particular
by
constitutional
provisions
or
is
the
abolition
of
slavery
within
the
appropriate
sphere
of
legislation
in
every
government
absolute
sovereignty
exists
in
the
united
states
it
exists
primarily
with
the
and
sovereignty
exists
with
them
in
each
of
the
states
the
legislature
possesses
a
sovereignty
delegated
by
the
people
through
the
constitution
the
people
thus
committing
to
the
legislature
a
portion
of
their
sovereignty
and
specifying
in
their
constitutions
the
amount
and
the
conditions
of
the
grant
that
the
in
any
state
where
slavery
exists
have
the
power
to
abolish
it
none
will
deny
if
the
legislature
have
not
the
power
it
is
because
have
reserved
it
to
themselves
had
they
lodged
with
the
legislature
power
to
exercise
exclusive
legislation
in
all
cases
whatsoever
they
would
have
parted
with
their
sovereignty
over
the
legislation
of
the
state
and
so
far
forth
the
legislature
would
have
become
clothed
with
all
their
functions
and
as
such
competent
the
continuance
of
the
to
do
whatever
the
people
might
have
done
before
the
surrender
of
their
power
consequently
they
would
have
the
power
to
abolish
slavery
the
sovereignty
of
the
district
of
columbia
exists
where
is
it
lodged
the
citizens
of
the
district
have
no
legislature
of
their
own
no
representation
in
congress
and
no
political
power
whatever
maryland
and
virginia
have
surrendered
to
the
united
states
their
full
and
absolute
right
and
entire
sovereignty
and
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
committed
to
congress
by
the
constitution
the
power
to
exercise
exclusive
legislation
in
all
cases
whatsoever
over
such
district
thus
the
sovereignty
of
the
district
of
columbia
is
shown
to
reside
solely
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
since
the
power
of
the
people
of
a
state
to
abolish
slavery
within
their
own
limits
results
from
their
entire
sovereignty
within
that
state
so
the
power
of
congress
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
results
from
its
entire
within
the
district
if
it
be
objected
that
congress
can
have
no
more
power
over
the
district
than
was
held
by
the
legislatures
of
maryland
and
virginia
we
ask
what
clause
in
the
constitution
graduates
the
power
of
congress
by
the
standard
of
a
state
legislature
was
the
united
states
constitution
worked
into
its
present
shape
under
the
measuring
line
and
square
of
virginia
and
maryland
and
is
its
power
to
be
bevelled
down
till
it
can
run
in
the
grooves
of
state
legislation
there
is
a
deal
of
prating
about
constitutional
power
over
the
district
as
though
congress
were
indebted
for
it
to
maryland
and
virginia
the
powers
of
those
states
whether
few
or
many
prodigies
or
nullities
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
as
well
thrust
in
the
powers
of
the
grand
lama
to
join
issue
upon
or
twist
papal
bulls
into
constitutional
tether
with
which
to
curb
congressional
action
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
gives
power
to
congress
and
takes
it
away
and
maryland
and
virginia
adopted
the
constitution
they
ceded
to
the
united
states
the
territory
of
the
district
by
their
acts
of
cession
they
abdicated
their
own
sovereignty
over
the
district
and
thus
made
room
for
that
provided
by
the
united
constitution
which
sovereignty
was
to
commence
as
soon
as
a
cession
of
territory
by
states
and
its
acceptance
by
congress
furnished
a
sphere
for
its
exercise
that
the
abolition
of
slavery
is
within
the
sphere
of
legislation
i
argue
from
the
fact
that
slavery
as
a
legal
system
is
the
creature
of
legislation
the
law
by
slavery
not
only
affirmed
its
to
be
within
the
sphere
and
under
the
control
of
legislation
but
equally
the
and
of
its
existence
and
the
whether
or
not
it
exist
of
course
legislation
would
not
travel
of
its
sphere
in
abolishing
what
is
it
and
what
was
recognised
to
be
within
it
by
its
own
act
can
not
legislatures
repeal
their
own
laws
if
law
can
take
from
a
man
his
rights
it
can
give
them
back
again
if
it
can
say
your
body
belongs
to
your
neighbor
it
can
say
it
belongs
to
if
it
can
annul
a
man
right
to
himself
held
by
express
grant
from
his
maker
and
can
create
for
another
an
title
to
him
can
it
not
annul
the
artificial
title
and
leave
the
original
owner
to
hold
himself
by
his
original
title
the
abolition
of
slavery
has
always
been
considered
within
the
appropriate
sphere
of
legislation
almost
every
civilized
nation
has
abolished
slavery
by
law
the
history
of
legislation
since
the
revival
of
letters
is
a
record
crowded
with
testimony
to
the
universally
admitted
competency
of
the
power
to
abolish
slavery
it
is
so
manifestly
an
attribute
not
merely
of
absolute
sovereignty
but
even
of
ordinary
legislation
that
the
competency
of
a
legislature
to
exercise
it
may
well
nigh
be
reckoned
among
the
legal
axioms
of
the
civilized
world
even
the
night
of
the
dark
ages
was
not
dark
enough
to
make
this
invisible
the
abolition
decree
of
the
great
council
of
england
was
passed
in
the
memorable
irish
decree
that
all
the
english
slaves
in
the
whole
of
ireland
be
immediately
emancipated
and
restored
to
their
former
liberty
was
issued
in
slavery
in
england
was
abolished
by
a
general
charter
of
emancipation
in
passing
over
many
instances
of
the
abolition
of
slavery
by
law

during
the
middle
ages
and
since
the
reformation

find
them
multiplying

in

the

an
act

the
competency

has
thus

for

it
has
been
embodied
in

celebrated
in

is
it
an
achievement
of
modern
discovery
that
such
a

is
a
nullity
that
all
these

are
void

that

also
believe
that
driving

places
thus
showing
that
the

is
within
the
boundary
of

the
competency
of
the

has
been
recognized
by
all
the

states
either
directly

by

some
states
recognize

in

as
may
have
rendered
the

some
distinguished
service

others
by

restrict
the

in
this
respect
why
this
express
prohibition
if
the

abolish
slavery
a
stately
farce
indeed
to
construct
a
special
clause
and
with
appropriate
rites
induct
it
into
the
constitution
for
the
express
purpose
of
restricting
a
nonentity
to
take
from
the
power
what
it
and
what
pertain
to
it
the
legislatures
of
those
states
have
no
power
to
abolish
slavery
simply
because
their
constitutions
have
expressly
that
power
the
people
of
arkansas
mississippi
well
knew
the
competency
of
the
power
to
abolish
slavery
and
hence
their
zeal
to
it
the
slaveholding
states
have
recognised
this
power
in
their
the
virginia
legislature
passed
a
law
in
to
prevent
the
further
importation

these
acts
show
the
prevalent
belief
at

time
in

states
that
the
general
government
had
adopted
a
line
of
policy
aiming
at
the
exclusion
of

from
the
entire
territory
of

not
included

states

that
this
policy
would
be
pursued

specific
and
formal
stipulation
slaveholding
states
have
asserted
this
power
their
judicial
in
numerous
cases
their
highest
courts
have
decided
that
if
the
legal
owner
of
slaves
takes
them
into
those
states
where
slavery
has
been
abolished
either
by
law
or
by
the
constitution
such
removal
emancipates
them
such
law
or
constitution
abolishing
their
slavery
this
principle
is
asserted
in
the
decision
of
the
supreme

of

by

for

neither

have

nothing

it

of

a
work
worthy
the
representatives

polished
and
enlightened
nation
the

legislature
asserted
this
power

close
of
a
month
debate
the
following
proceedings
were
had
i
extract
from
an
editorial
article
of
the
richmond
whig
of
january
the
report
of
the
select
committee
adverse
to
legislation
on
the
subject
of
abolition
was
in
these
words
as
the
opinion
of
this
committee
that
it
is
inexpedient
for
the
present
to
make
any
enactments
for
the
abolition
of
this
report
preston
moved
to
reverse
and
thus
to
declare
that
it
expedient
to
make
legislative
enactments
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
this
was
meeting
the
question
in
its
strongest
form
it
demanded
action
and
immediate
action
on
this
proposition
the
vote
was
to
many
of
the
most
decided
friends
of
abolition
voted
against
the
amendment
because
they
thought
public
opinion
not
sufficiently
prepared
for
it
and
that
it
might
prejudice
the
cause
to
move
too
rapidly
the
vote
on
witcher
motion
to
postpone
the
whole
subject
indefinitely
indicates
the
true
state
of
opinion
in
the
that
was
the
test
question
and
was
so
intended
and
proclaimed
by
its
mover
that
motion
was
to
showing
a
majority
of
who
by
that
vote
declared
their
belief
that
at
the
proper
time
and
in
the
proper
mode
virginia
ought
to
commence
a
system
of
gradual
abolition
the
congress
of
the
united
states
have
asserted
this
power
the
ordinance
of
declaring
that
there
should
be
neither
slavery
nor
involuntary
servitude
in
the
north
western
territory
abolished
the
slavery
then
existing
there
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi

its
decision
in
the
case
of
harvey
decker
walker
mi
declared
that
the
ordinance
emancipated
the
slaves
then
held
there
in
this
decision
the
question
is
argued
ably
and
at
great
length
the
supreme
court
of
la
made
the
same
decision
in
the
case
of
forsyth
nash
martin
la
the
same
doctrine
was
laid
down
by

porter
late

senator

the
march
term
of
the
la
supreme
court
in
the
case
of
merry
chexnaider
martin
that
the
ordinance
abolished
the
slavery
then
existing
there
is
also
shown
by
the
fact
that
persons
holding
slaves
in
the
territory
petitioned
for
the
repeal
of
the
article
abolishing
slavery
assigning
as
a
reason
the
petition
of
the
citizens
of
randolph
and
clair
counties
in
the
illinois
country
stating
that
they
were
in
possession
of
slaves
and
praying
the
repeal
of
that
act
the
article
of
the
ordinance
of
and
the
passage
of
a
law
legalizing
slavery
there
am
state
papers
public
lands
p
congress
passed
this
ordinance
before
the
united
states
constitution
was
adopted
when
it
derived
all
its
authority
from
the
articles
of
confederation
which
conferred
powers
of
legislation
far
more
restricted
than
those
conferred
on
congress
over
the
district
and
territories
by
the
united
states
constitution
now
we
ask
how
does
the
constitution
the
powers
which
congress
possessed
under
the
articles
of
confederation
the
abolition
of
the
slave
trade
by
congress
in
is
another
illustration
of
the
competency
of
legislative
power
to
abolish
slavery
the
african
slave
trade
has
become
such
a
mere
in
common
parlance
that
the
fact
of
its
being
is
overlooked
the
buying
and
selling
the
transportation
and
the
horrors
of
the
middle
passage
were
mere
of
the
slavery
in
which
the
victims
were
held
let
things
be
called
by
their
own
names
when
congress
abolished
the
african
slave
trade
it
abolished
slavery
supreme
slavery
power
frantic
with
license
trampling
a
whole
hemisphere
scathed
with
its
fires
and
running
down
with
blood
true
congress
did
not
in
the
abolition
of
the
slave
trade
abolish
the
slavery
within
its
jurisdiction
but
it
did
abolish
all
the
slavery
in
part
of
its
jurisdiction
what
has
rifled
it
of
power
to
abolish
slavery
in
part
of
its
jurisdiction
especially
in
that
part
where
it
has
exclusive
legislation
in
all
cases
whatsoever
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
recognises
this
power
by
the
most
conclusive
implication
in
art
sec
clause
it
prohibits
the
abolition
of
the
slave
trade
previous
to
thus
implying
the
power
of
congress
to
do
it
at
once
but
for
the
restriction
and
its
power
to
do
it
when
that
restriction
ceased
again
in
art
sec
no
person
held
to
service
or
labor
in

laws
thereof
escaping
into
another

in
consequence
of
any
law
or
regulation
therein
be
discharged
from
said
service
or

this
clause
was
inserted
as
all
admit
to
prevent
the
runaway
slave
from
being
emancipated
by
the
of
the
free
states
if
these
laws
had
to
emancipate
why
this
constitutional
guard
to
prevent
it
the
insertion
of
the
clause
was
the
testimony
of
the
eminent
jurists
that
framed
the
constitution
to
the
existence
of
the
and
their
public
proclamation
that
the
abolition
of
slavery
was
within
the
appropriate
sphere
of

of

is
rightfully

founded
on
a
principle

is
recognised

protected
by
all
civilized

is
by
general
consent

slaveholders
insisted
upon
the
insertion
of
this
clause
in

constitution
that
they
might
secure
by
an
that
from
which
protection
is
withheld
by
the
acknowledged
principles
of
universal
law
a
by
demanding
this
provision
slaveholders
consented
that
their
slaves
should
not
be
recognised
as
property
by
the
united
states
constitution
and
hence
they
found
their
claim
on
the
fact
of
their
being
and
to
service
footnote
a
the
fact
that
under
the
articles
of
confederation
slaveholders
whose
slaves
had
escaped
into
free
states
had
no
legal
power
to
force
them
back

they
have
no
power
to
recover
by
process
of
law
their
slaves
who
escape

to

the

cited
in
which
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
decided
that

this
has
been
done
with
certain
restrictions
in
most
of
the
states

by
legislative
acts
or
by
constitutional
implication
the
common
law

no

its
principles

it

resolution

that
the

colonies
are
entitled
to
the

to
the
great
and
inestimable
privilege
of
being

according
to
the
course

chief
justice
ellsworth
in
one
of
his
decisions

supreme
court
said
the
common
law
of
this
country
remains
the
same
as
it
was
before
the
revolution
chief
justice
marshall
in
his
decision
in
the
case
of
livingston
jefferson
said
when
our
ancestors
migrated
to
america
they
brought
with
them
the
common
law
of
their
native
country
so
far
as
it
was
applicable
to
their
new
situation
and
i
do
not
conceive
that
the
revolution
in
any
degree
changed
the
relations
of
man
to
man
or
the
law
which
regulates
them
in
breaking
our
political
connection
with
the
parent
state
we
did
not
break
our
connection
with
each
other

journal

duponceau

in

says
i
consider
the
common
law
of
england
the
of
the
united
states
i
think
i
can
lay
it
down
as
a
correct
principle
that
the
common
law
of
england
as
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
declaration
of
independence
still
continues
to
be
the
national
law
of
this
country
so
far
as
it
is
applicable
to
our
present
state
and
subject
to
the
modifications
it
has
received
here
in
the
course
of
nearly
half
a
century
chief

taylor
of
north

in
his
decision
in
the

of

in
hawkes
says
a
law
of
obligation
to
the
was
violated
by
the
offence
common
law
founded
upon
the
law
of
nature
and
confirmed
by
revelation
the
legislation
of
the
united
states
abounds
in
recognitions
of
the
principles
of
the
common
law
asserting
their
paramount
binding
power
sparing
details
of
which
our
national
state
papers
are
full
we
illustrate
by
a
single
instance
it
was
made
a
condition
of
the
admission
of
louisiana
into
the
union
that
the
right
of
trial
by
jury
should
be
secured
to
all
her
citizens
the
united
states
government
thus
employing
its
power
to
enlarge
the
jurisdiction
of
the
common
law
in
this
its
great
representative
having
shown
that
the
abolition
of
slavery
is
within
the
competency
of
the
power
when
unrestricted
by
constitutional
provisions
and
that
the
legislation
of
congress
over
the
district
is
thus
unrestricted
its
power
to
abolish
slavery
there
is
established
we
argue
it
further
from
the
fact
that
slavery
exists
there
by
an
act
of
congress
in
the
act
of
july
congress
accepted
portions
of
territory
offered
by
the
states
of
maryland
and
virginia
and
enacted
that
the
laws
as
they
then
were
should
continue
in
force
until
congress
shall
otherwise
by
law
provide
under
these
laws
adopted
by
congress
and
in
effect
and
made

of
the
district
the
slaves
there
are
now
held
is
congress
so
impotent
in
its
own
exclusive
jurisdiction
that
it
otherwise
by
law
provide
if
it
can
say
what
be
considered
property
it
can
say
what
shall
be
considered
property
suppose
a
legislature
should
enact
that
marriage
contracts
shall
be
mere
bills
of
sale
making
a
husband
the
proprietor
of
his
wife
as
his
property
and
suppose
husbands
should
herd
their
wives
in
droves
for
the
market
as
beasts
of
burden
or
for
the
brothel
as
victims
of
lust
and
then
prate
about
their
inviolable
legal
property
and
deny
the
power
of
the
legislature
which
stamped
them
property
to
undo
its
own
wrong
and
secure
to
wives
by
law
the
rights
of
human
beings
would
such
cant
about
legal
rights
be
heeded
where
reason
and
justice
held
sway
and
where
law
based
upon
fundamental
morality
received
homage
if
a
frantic
legislature
pronounces
woman
a
chattel
has
it
no
power
with
returning
reason
to
take
back
the
blasphemy
is
the
impious
edict
irrepealable

sympathy
for
the
slaves
of
missouri
and
this
cold
insensibility
this
eternal
apathy
towards
the
slaves
in
the
district
of
columbia
it
is
quite
unnecessary
to
add
that
the
most
distinguished
northern
statesmen
of
both
political
parties
have
always
affirmed
the
power
of
congress
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
president
van
buren
in
his
letter
of
march
to
a
committee
of
gentlemen
in
north
carolina
says
i
would
not
from
the
light
now
before
me
feel
myself
safe
in
pronouncing
that
congress
does
not
possess
the
power
of
abolishing
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
this
declaration
of
the
president
is
consistent
with
his
avowed
sentiments
touching
the
missouri
question
on
which
he
coincided
with
such
men
as
daniel
tompkins
de
witt
clinton
and
others
whose
names
are
a
host
a
it
is
consistent
also
with
his
recommendation
in
his
late
message
in
which
speaking
of
the
district
he
strongly
urges
upon
congress
a
thorough
and
careful
revision
of
its
local
government
speaks
of
the
entire
dependence
of
the
people
of
the
district
upon
congress
recommends
that
a
uniform
system
of
local
government
be
adopted
and
adds
that
although
it
was
selected
as
the
seat
of
the
general
government
the
site
of
its
public
edifices
the
depository
of
its
archives
and
the
residence
of
officers
entrusted
with
large
amounts
of
public
property
and
the
management
of
public
business
yet
it
never
has
been
subjected
to
or
received
that
and
legislation
which
these
circumstances
peculiarly
demanded
footnote
a
van
buren
when
a
member
of
the
senate
of
voted
for
the
following
preamble
and
resolutions
which
passed
unanimously
jan
whereas
the
inhibiting
the
further
extension
of
slavery
in
the
united
states
is
a
subject
of
deep
concern
to
the
people
of
this
state
and
whereas
we
consider
slavery
as
an
evil
much
to
be
deplored
and
that
constitutional
barrier
should
be
interposed
to
prevent
its
further
and
that
the

of
the

gives
congress
the
to
require
new

comprised
within
the
original
boundary
of
the

to
the
prohibition
of
a
condition
of
their
admission
into

therefore
resolved
that
our
senators
be

be
requested
to
oppose
the

of
the
sentiments
of
northern
statesmen
as
to
the
power
of

to
abolish

an
explicit
declaration
that
an
of
the
congress
concede
the
power
to
abolish
slavery
in
the

has
just
been
made

has
arrived
when
we
must
have
new
guaranties
under
the
constitution
or
the

must
be
dissolved
views
of
the
constitution
are
not
those
of
the
an
overwhelming
majority
that
by
the
constitution
congress
may
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
may
abolish
the
slave
trade
between
the
states
that
is
it
may
prohibit
their
being
carried
out
of
the
state
in
which
they
are
and
prohibit
it
in
all
the
territories
florida
among
them
they
not
without
strong
reasons
the
power
of
congress
extends
to
all
of
these
to
show
that
the
power
of
congress
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
has
always
till
recently
been
is
perhaps
quite
superfluous
we
subjoin
however
the
following
the
of
the
united
states
in
his
speech
on
the
missouri
question
quoted
above
after
contending
that
the
restriction
of
slavery
in
missouri
would
be
unconstitutional
declares
that
the
power
of
congress
over
slavery
in
the
district
could
not
be
questioned
in
the
speech
of
smyth
of
also
quoted
above
he
declares
the
power
of
congress
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
to
be
undoubted
sutherland
of
in
a
speech
in
the
house
of
representatives
on
the
motion
to
print
pinckney
report
is
thus
reported
in
the
washington
globe
of
may
he
replied
to
the
remark
that
the
report
conceded
that
congress
had
a
right
to
legislate
upon
the
subject
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
said
that
such
a
right
had
never
been
till
recently
denied
the
american
quarterly
review
published
at
philadelphia
with
a
large
circulation
and
list
of
contributors
in
the
slave
states
holds
the
following
language
in
the
september
no
under
this
jurisdiction
granted
by
the
constitution
congress
has
power
to
abolish
slavery
and
the
slave
trade
in
the
district
of
columbia
it
would
hardly
be
necessary
to
state
this
as
a
distinct
proposition
had
it
not
been
occasionally
questioned
the
truth
of
the
assertion
however
is
too
obvious
to
admit
of
argument
and
we
believe
has
never
been
disputed
by
persons
who
are
familiar
with
the
constitution
objections
to
the
foregoing
conclusions
considered
we
now
proceed
to
notice
briefly
the
main
arguments
that
have
been
employed
in
congress
and
elsewhere
against
the
power
of
congress
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
one
of
the
most
plausible
is
that
the
conditions
on
which
maryland
and
virginia
ceded
the
district
to
the
united
states
would
be
violated
if
congress
should
abolish
slavery
there
the
reply
to
this
is
that
congress
had
no
power
to
a
cession
coupled
with
conditions
restricting
that
power
of
exclusive
legislation
in
all
cases
whatsoever
over
such
district
which
was
given
it
by
the
constitution
to
show
the
futility
of
the
objection
we
insert
here
the
acts
of
cession
the
cession
of
maryland
was
made
in
november
and
is
as
follows
an
act
to
cede
to
congress
a
district
of
ten
miles
square
in
this
state
for
the
seat
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
be
it
enacted
by
the
general
assembly
of
maryland
that
the
representatives
of
this
state
in
the
house
of
representatives
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
appointed
to
assemble
at
on
the
first
wednesday
of
march
next
be
and
they
are
hereby
authorized
and
required
on
the
behalf
of
this
state
to
cede
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
any
district
in
this
state
not
exceeding
ten
miles
square
which
the
congress
may
fix
upon
and
accept
for
the
seat
of
government
of
the
united
states
laws
of
the
cession
of
virginia
was
made
on
the
of
december
in
the
following
words
be
it
enacted
by
the
general
assembly
that
a
tract
of
country
not
exceeding
ten
miles
square
or
any
lesser
quantity
to
be
located
within
the
limits
of
the
state
and
in
any
part
thereof
as
congress
may
by
law
direct
shall
be
and
the
same
is
hereby
forever
ceded
and
relinquished
to
the
congress
and
government
of
the
united
states
in
full
and
absolute
right
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
as
well
of
soil
as
of
persons
residing
or
to
reside
thereon
pursuant
to
the
tenor
and
effect
of
the
eighth
section
of
the
first
article
of
the
government
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
but
were
there
no
provisos
to
these
acts
the
maryland
act
had
the
virginia
act
had
this
proviso
sect
provided
that
nothing
herein
contained
shall
be
construed
to
vest
in
the
united
states
any
right
of
property
in
the
soil
or
to
affect
the
rights
of
individuals
otherwise
than
the
same
shall
or
may
be
transferred
by
such
individuals
to
the
united
states
this
specification
touching
the
soil
was
merely
definitive
and
explanatory
of
that
clause
in
the
act
of
cession
and
absolute
instead
of
restraining
the
power
of
congress
on
and
other
subjects
it
even
gives
it
freer
course
for
exceptions
to
of
a
rule
give
double
confirmation
to
those
parts
not
embraced
in
the
exceptions
if
it
was
the
of
the
proviso
to
restrict
congressional
action
on
the
subject
of
why
is
the
specified
as
legal
instruments
are
not
paragons
of
economy
in
words
might
not
john
doe
out
of
his
abundance
and
without
spoiling
his
style
have
afforded
an
additional
word
at
least
a
hint
that
slavery
was
though
nothing
was
about
it
but
again
maryland
and
virginia
in
their
acts
of
cession
declare
them
to
be
in
pursuance
of
that
clause
of
the
constitution
which
gives
to
congress
exclusive
legislation
in
all
cases
whatsoever
over
the
ten
miles
square
thus
instead
of
that
clause
both
states
it
now
their
acts
of
cession
either
accorded
with
that
clause
of
the
constitution
or
they
conflicted
with
it
if
they
conflicted
with
it
the
cessions
was
a
violation
of
the
constitution
the
fact
that
congress
accepted
the
cessions
proves
that
in
its
view
their
did
not
conflict
with
its
constitutional
grant
of
power
the
inquiry
whether
these
acts
of
cession
were
consistent
or
inconsistent
with
the
united
states
constitution
is
totally
irrelevant
to
the
question
at
issue
what
saith
the
constitution
that
is
the
question
not
what
saith
virginia
or
maryland
or
equally
to
the
point
john
bull
if
maryland
and
virginia
had
been
the
authorized
interpreters
of
the
constitution
for
the
union
these
acts
of
cession
could
hardly
have
been
magnified
more
than
they
have
been
recently
by
the
southern
delegation
in
congress
a
true
understanding
of
the
constitution
can
be
had
forsooth
only
by
holding
it
up
in
the
light
of
maryland
and
virginia
legislation
we
are
told
again
that
those
states
would
not
have
ceded
the
district
if
they
had
supposed
the
constitution
gave
congress
power
to
abolish
slavery
in
it
this
comes
with
an
ill
grace
from
maryland
and
virginia
they
the
constitution
they
were
parties
to
it
they
had
sifted
it
clause
by
clause
in
their
state
conventions
they
had
weighed
its
words
in
the
balance
they
had
tested
them
as
by
fire
and
finally
after
long
pondering
they
the
constitution
and
they
ceded
the
ten
miles
square
and
declared
the
cession
made
in
pursuance
of
that
clause
congress
shall
have
power
to
exercise
exclusive
legislation
in
all
cases
whatsoever
over
such
district
and
now
verily
they
would
not
have
ceded
if
they
had
cede
it
they
and
in
full
and
absolute
right
both
of
soil
and
persons
congress
accepted
the
cession
state
power
over
the
district
ceased
and
congressional
power
over
it
commenced
and
now
the
sole
question
to
be
settled
is
amount
of
power
over
the
district
lodged
in
congress
by
the
the
constitution
the
constitution
that
is
the
point
maryland
and
virginia
suppositions
must
be
potent
suppositions
to
abrogate
a
clause
of
the
united
constitution
that
clause
either
gives
congress
power
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
or
it
does
and
that
point
is
to
be
settled
not
by
state
suppositions
nor
state
usages
nor
state
legislation
but
the
terms
of
the
clause
southern
members
of
congress
in
the
recent
discussions
have
conceded
the
power
of
a
contingent
abolition
in
the
district
by
suspending
it
upon
the
of
the
people
such
a
doctrine
from
like
alford
of
georgia
and
walker
of
mississippi
would
excite
no
surprise
but
that
it
should
be
honored
with
the
endorsement
of
such
men
as
rives
and
calhoun
is
quite
unaccountable
are
attributes
of
mere
creatures
of
is
delegated
mere
conditional
is
a
to
be
exercised
by
those
who
hold
it
only
by
popular
must
it
lie
helpless
at
the
pool
of
public
sentiment
waiting
the
gracious
troubling
of
its
waters
is
it
a
lifeless
corpse
save
only
when
popular
consent
deigns
to
puff
breath
into
its
nostrils
besides
if
the
consent
of
the
people
of
the
district
be
necessary
the
consent
of
the
people
must
be
had
not
that
of
a
majority
however
large
majorities
to
be
authoritative
must
be
and
a
legal
majority
without
legislative
power
or
right
of
representation
or
even
the
electoral
franchise
would
be
truly
an
anomaly
in
the
district
of
columbia
such
a
thing
as
a
majority
in
a
legal
sense
is
unknown
to
law
to
talk
of
the
power
of
a
majority
or
the
will
of
a
majority
there
is
mere
mouthing
a
majority
then
it
has
an
authoritative
will
and
an
organ
to
make
it
known
and
an
executive
to
carry
it
into
effect
where
are
they
we
repeat
it
if
the
consent
of
the
people
of
the
district
be
necessary
the
consent
of
is
necessary
and
consent
will
come
only
with
the
greek
kalends
and
a
perpetual
motion
a
single
individual
might
thus
slavery
in
defiance
of
the
expressed
will
of
a
whole
people
the
most
common
form
of
this
fallacy
is
given
by
mr
wise
of
virginia
in
his
speech
february
in
which
he
denied
the
power
of
congress
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
unless
the
inhabitants
owning
slaves
petitioned
for
it
southern
members
of
congress
at
the
present
session
ring
changes
almost
daily
upon
the
same
fallacy
what
pray
congress
a
power
which
it
it
is
required
of
a
man
according
to
what
he
saith
the
scripture
i
commend
mr
wise
to
paul
for
his
ethics
would
that
he
had
got
his
of
him
if
congress
does
not
possess
the
power
why
taunt
it
with
its
weakness
by
asking
its
exercise
why
mock
it
by
demanding
impossibilities
petitioning
according
to
mr
wise
is
in
matters
of
legislation
omnipotence
itself
the
very
of
all
constitutional
power
for
congress
to
do
what
it
do
gives
it
the
power
to
pray
the
exercise
of
a
power
that
is
it
a
beautiful
theory
let
us
work
it
both
ways
if
to
petition
for
the
exercise
of
a
power
that
is
creates
it
to
petition
against
the
exercise
of
a
power
that
annihilates
it
as
southern
gentlemen
are
partial
to
summary
processes
pray
sirs
try
the
virtue
of
your
own
recipe
on
exclusive
legislation
in
all
cases
whatsoever
a
better
subject
for
experiment
and
test
of
the
prescription
could
not
be
had
but
if
the
petitions
of
the
citizens
of
the
district
give
congress
the
to
abolish
slavery
they
impose
the
if
they
confer
constitutional
they
create
constitutional
if
congress
abolish
because
of
an
expression
of
their
will
it
abolish
at
the
bidding
of
that
will
if
the
people
of
the
district
are
a
of
to
congress
their
will
has
the
force
of
a
constitutional
provision
and
has
the
same
binding
power
upon
the
national
legislature
to
make
congress
dependent
on
the
district
for
authority
is
to
make
it
a
of
its
authority
restraining
the
exercise
of
its
own
discretion
and
sinking
it
into
a
mere
organ
of
the
district
will
we
proceed
to
another
objection
southern
states
would
not
have
ratified
the
constitution
if
they
had
supposed
that
it
gave
this
it
is
a
sufficient
answer
to
this
objection
that
the
northern
states
would
not
have
ratified
it
if
they
had
supposed
that
it
the
power
if
suppositions
are
to
take
the
place
of
the
constitution
coming
from
both
sides
they
neutralize
each
other
to
argue
a
constitutional
question
by
at
the
suppositions
that
might
have
been
made
by
the
parties
to
it
would
find
small
favor
in
a
court
of
law
but
even
a
desperate
shift
is
some
easement
when
sorely
pushed
if
this
question
is
to
be
settled
by
suppositions
suppositions
shall
be
forthcoming
and
that
without
stint
first
then
i
affirm
that
the
north
ratified
the
constitution
supposing
that
slavery
had
begun
to
wax
old
and
would
speedily
vanish
away
and
especially
that
the
abolition
of
the
slave
trade
which
by
the
constitution
was
to
be
surrendered
to
congress
after
twenty
years
would
cast
it
headlong
would
the
north
have
adopted
the
constitution
giving
of
the
slave
property
a
representation
if
it
had
supposed
that
the
slaves
would
have
increased
from
half
a
million
to
two
millions
and
a
half
by
and
that
the
census
of
would
give
to
the
slave
states
thirty
representatives
of
slave
property
if
they
had
supposed
that
this
representation
would
have
controlled
the
legislation
of
the
government
and
carried
against
the
north
every
question
vital
to
its
interests
would
hamilton
franklin
sherman
gerry
livingston
langdon
and
rufus
king
have
been
such
madmen
as
to
sign
the
constitution
and
the
northern
states
such
suicides
as
to
ratify
it
every
instinct
would
have
shrieked
at
such

the

are
generally
engaged
in
the
preservation
of
their

among
which
that

the

we
for

the
necessity

it
were
for
men
who
exercise
their
reason
to
believe
that
the
divine
author
of
our
existence
intended
a
part

divines
in

to

negro
slaves
in
the
american
colonies
says
the
conviction
of
the
unjustifiableness
of
this
practice
slavery
has
been
and
spreading
of
and
who
have
had
slaves
have
found
themselves
so
unable
to
justify
their
own
conduct
in
holding
them
in
bondage
as
to
be
induced
to
them
at
slavery
is
every
wrong
unrighteous
and
oppressive
a
very
great
and
crying
sin
being
nothing
of
the
kind
equal
to
it
on
the
face
of
the
the
same
year
the
american
congress
issued
a
solemn
manifesto
to
the
world
these
were
its
first
words
we
hold
these
truths
to
be
that
all
men
are
created
equal
that
they
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
inalienable
rights
that
among
these
are
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
these
were
words
of
power
a
rhetorical
flourish
the
celebrated
patrick
henry
of
virginia
in
a
letter
of
to
robert
pleasants
afterwards
president
of
the
virginia
abolition
society
says
believe
me
i
shall
honor
the
quakers
for
their
noble
efforts
to
abolish
slavery
it
is
a
debt
we
owe
to
the
purity
of
our
religion
to
show
that
it
is
at
variance
with
that
law
that
warrants
slavery
i
exhort
you
to
persevere
in
so
worthy
a
resolution
in
the
continental
congress
ordered
a
pamphlet
to
be
published
entitled
observations
on
the
american
revolution
from
which
the
following
is
an
extract
the
great
principle
of
government
is
and
ever
will
remain
in
force
men
are
by
nature
and
so
long
as
we
have
any
idea
of
divine
we
must
associate
that
of
it
is
on
all
hands
that
the
right
to
be
can
never
be
alienated
extract
from
the
pennsylvania
act
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
passed
march
we
conceive
that
it
is
our
duty
and
we
rejoice
that
it
is
in
our
power
to
extend
a
portion
of
that
freedom
to
others
which
has
been
extended
to
us
weaned
by
a
long
course
of
experience
from
those
narrow
prejudices
and
partialities
we
had
imbibed
we
find
our
hearts
enlarged
with
kindness
and
benevolence
towards
men
of
all
conditions
and
nations
therefore
be
it
enacted
that
no
child
born
hereafter
be
a
slave
jefferson
in
his
notes
on

just
before

close
of

says
i
think
a
change
already
perceptible
since
the
origin
of
the
present
revolution
the
spirit
of
the
master
is
abating
that
of
the

is
rising
from
the
dust
his
condition
mollifying

i
hope
preparing
under

jefferson
then

says
from
the
mouth
to
the
head
of
the
chesapeake
bulk
of
the
people
will
approve
of
your

and
it
will
find
a
respectable
minority
ready
to
it
in
a
minority
which
for
weight
and
worth
of

against
the
greater

he
says
this
is
the
next
state
to
which
we
may
turn
our

for
the
interesting

of

in

with
avarice
and
oppression
a
conflict
in
which
the
sacred

is
gaining
daily
recruits
be
not
therefore
discouraged
what
you
have
written
will
do
a

of
and

you
still
trouble
yourself
with
our
welfare
no

most
of
them
of
a
wythe
one
of
the
most
virtuous
of
characters
and
sentiments
on
the

are
i
am
satisfied
if
you

resolve
to
address
an
exhortation

those
young

with
all
that
eloquence
of
which
you
are

that
influence
on
the

important
question
would
be
great
perhaps
thus
you
see
that
so
far
from
thinking
you
have
cause
to
repent
of
what
you
have
done
wish
you
to
do
more

is
an
extract
from
a
sober
conviction
of
the
unrighteousness
of

your
petitioners
have
long
beheld
with
grief
our
fellow
men
doomed
to
perpetual
bondage
in
a
country
which
boasts
of
her
freedom
your
petitioners
are
fully
of
opinion
that
calm
reflection
will
at
last
convince
the
world
that
the
whole
system
of
african
slavery
is
unjust
in
its
nature
impolitic
in
its
principles
and
in
its
consequences
ruinous
to
the
industry
and
enterprise
of
the
citizens
of

from
a
conviction
of
those
truths
your

were
led
by
motives
we
conceive
of
general
philanthropy
to
associate
ourselves
for
the
protection
and
assistance
of
this
unfortunate
part
of
our
fellow
men
and
though
this
society
has
been
established
it
has
now
become
through
this
state
and
we
fully
believe
on
this
subject
the
sentiments
of
a
large
majority
of
its
the
same
year
the
virginia
abolition
society
was
formed
this
society
and
the
maryland
society
had
auxiliaries
in
different
parts
of

up
memorials
to

the
memorial
of
the
virginia
society

headed
the
memorial
of
the
for
promoting
the
abolition
of
slavery
the
following
is
an
extract
your
memorialists
fully
believing
that
slavery
is
not
only
an
odious
degradation
but
an
violation
of
one
of
the
most
essential
rights
of
human
nature
and
utterly
repugnant
to
the
precepts
of
the
lament
that
a
practice
so
inconsistent
with
true
policy
and
the
inalienable
rights
of
men
should
subsist
in
so
enlightened
an
age

people
professing
that
all
mankind
are
by
nature
equally
entitled
to
freedom
about
the

time
a
society
was
formed
in

it
had
an
acting
committee
of
five
members
in
each
county
in
the
state
the
following
is
an
extract
from
the
preamble
to
its

it
is
our
boast
that
we
live
under
a
government
wherein
and
the
of
are
recognized
as
the
universal
rights
of
men
and
whilst
we
are
anxious
to
preserve
these
rights
to
ourselves

transmit
them
inviolate
to

posterity

that
inconsistent
illiberal
and

which
withholds

unfortunate

said
i
can
not
help
expressing
the
pleasure
i
feel
in
finding
considerable
a
of
the

attending
to
matters
of
such
a
momentous
concern
to
the

happiness
of

of

i
think
it
my
duty
as
a
citizen
of
the

espouse
their
mr
page
of
virginia
afterward
governor
was
of
the
commitment
he
hoped
that
the
designs
of
the
respectable
memorialists
would
not
be
stopped
at
the
threshold
in
order
to
preclude
a
fair
discussion
of
the
prayer
of
the
memorial
with
respect
to
the
alarm
that
was
apprehended
he
conjectured
there
was
none
but
there
might
be
just
cause
if
the
memorial
was
taken
into
consideration
he
placed
himself
in
the
case
of
a
slave
and
said
that
on
hearing
that
congress
had
refused
to
listen
to
the
decent
suggestions
of
a
respectable
part
of
the
community
he
should
infer
that
the
general
government
which
was
expected
great
good
would
result
every
class
had
shut
their
ears
against
the
voice
of
humanity
and
he
should
despair
of
any
alleviation
of
the
miseries
he
and
his
posterity
had
in
prospect
if
any
thing
could
induce
him
to
rebel
it
must
be
a
stroke
like
this
impressing
on
his
mind
all
the
horrors
of
despair
but
if
he
was
told
that
application
was
made
in
his
behalf
and
that
congress
were
willing
to
hear
what
could
be
urged
in
favor
of
discouraging
the
practice
of
importing

would
trust
in
their
justice
and
humanity

the
decision

can
not
for

not

national
safety
and
happiness
and
prudent
policy
require
it
of
us
i
conceive
the
constitution
in
this
particular
was
formed
in
order
that
the
government
whilst
it
was
restrained
from
laying
a
total
prohibition
might
be
able
to
some
testimony
of
the
sense

with
respect
to
the
african
trade
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
by
expressing
a
national
disapprobation
of
this
trade
we
may
destroy
it
and
save
ourselves
from
reproaches
and
our
posterity
the
imbecility
ever
attendant
on
a
country
filled
with
slaves
if
there
is
any
one
point
in
which
it
is
clearly
the
policy
of
this
nation
so
far
as
we
constitutionally
can
vary

greater
injury
when
i
deprive

than
when
i
deprive
him
of
his
property
it
is
vain
for
me
to
plead
that
i
have
the
sanction
of
law
for
this
makes
the
injury
the
greater
it
arms
the
community
against
him
and
makes
his
case
desperate
the
owners
of
such
slaves
then
are
and
not
the
just
proprietors
of
what
they
claim
freeing
them
is
not
depriving
them
of
property
but
it
to
the
right
in
america
a
slave
is
a
standing
monument
of
the
tyranny
and
inconsistency
of
human
governments
the
master
is
the
enemy
of
the
slave
he
made
open
war
upon
and
is
daily
carrying
it
on
in
unremitted
efforts
can
any
one
imagine
then
that
the
slave
is
indebted
to
his
master
and
to
serve
whence
can
the
obligation
arise
what
is
it
founded
upon
what
is
my
duty
to
an
enemy
that
is
carrying
on
war
against
me
i
do
not
deny
but
in
some
circumstances
it
is
the
duty
of
the
slave
to
serve
but
it
is
a
duty
he
owes
himself
and
not
his
master
president
edwards
the
younger
said
in
a
sermon
preached
before
the
connecticut
abolition
society
thirty
years
ago
scarcely
a
man
in
this
country
thought
either
the
slave
trade
or
the
slavery
of
negroes
to
be
wrong
but
now
how
many
and
able
advocates
in
private
life
in
our
legislatures
in
congress
have
appeared
and
have
openly
and
irrefragably
pleaded
the
rights
of
humanity
in
this
as
well
as
other
instances
and
if
we
judge
of
the
future
by
the
past
fifty
years
from
this
time
it
will
be
as
shameful
for
a
man
to
hold
a
negro
slave
as
to
be
guilty
of

there

which
neither

have
at

but
which
is
more
than
that
they
and
at
a
period
not
remote
in

passed

celebrated

as
that

in

degree
to
alarm
us

we
apprehensive
that

will
become
more
dangerous

alarmed

into

be

with
a
deadly
enmity
against

unaccountable
paradox
how
much
more
rational
would
it
be
to
argue

is
he
who

said
the
idea
of
a

and

of

from

is
coeval
with
the
declaration
of
our
independence
from

yoke
it
sprung
into
existence
during

of

to

senator
from

says
i
thought
till
very
lately
that
it
was
known
to
every
body
that
during
the
revolution
for
many
years
after
the
abolition
of
slavery
was
a
favorite
topic
with
many
of
our
ablest
who
entertained
with
respect
all
the
schemes
which
wisdom
or
ingenuity
could
suggest
for
accomplishing
the
object
wythe
to
the
day
of
his
death
for
a
simple
abolition
considering
the
objection
to
color
as
founded
in

degrees

of
the

were
abandoned

now
we

these
projects
revived
governor
barbour
of
virginia
in
his
speech
in
the
senate
on
the
missouri
question
said
we
are
asked
why
has
virginia
her
in
reference
to
slavery
that
the
sentiments
of
most
distinguished
for
thirty
years
with
the
course
which
the
friends
of
the
restriction
of
slavery
in
missouri
now
advocated
and
that
the
virginia
delegation
one
of
whom
was
the
late
president
of
the
united
states
voted
for
the
restriction
of
slavery
in
the
northwestern
territory
and
that
jefferson
has
delineated
a
gloomy
picture
of
the
baneful
effects
of
slavery
when
it
is
recollected
that
the
notes
of
jefferson
were
written
during
the
progress
of
the
revolution
it
is
no
matter
of
surprise
that
the
writer
should
have
imbibed
a
large
portion
of
that
enthusiasm
which
such
an
occasion
was
so
well
calculated
to
produce
as
to
the
consent
of
the
virginia
delegation
to
the
restriction
in
question
whether
the
result
of
a
disposition
to
restrain
the
slave
trade
indirectly
or
the
influence
of
that
enthusiasm
to
which
i
have
just
alluded
it
is
not
now
important
to
decide
we
have
witnessed
its
effects
the
liberality
of
virginia
or
as
the
result
may
prove
her
folly
which
submitted
to
or
if
you
will
proposed
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
territory
has
eventuated
in
effects
which
speak
a
monitory
lesson
is
the
representation
from
this
quarter
on
the
present
question
imlay
in
his
early
history
of
kentucky
says
we
have
disgraced
the
fair
face
of
humanity
and
trampled
upon
the
sacred
privileges
of
man
at
the
very
moment
that
we
were
exclaiming
against
the
tyranny
of
your
the
english
ministry
but
in
contending
for
the
birthright
of
freedom
we
have
learned
to
feel
the
bondage
of
and
in
the
libations
we
offer
to
the

some
of

points
established
by
the

are
the
universal
expectation
that
the
influence
of
congress
of
state
legislatures
of
seminaries
of
learning
of
churches
of
the
ministers
of
religion
and
of
public
sentiment
widely
embodied
in
abolition
societies
would
be
exerted
against
slavery
calling
forth
by
argument
and
appeal
the
moral
sense
of
the
nation
and
creating
a
power
of
opinion
that
would
abolish
the
system
throughout
the
union
in
a
word
that
free
speech
and
a
free
press
would
be
wielded
against
slavery
without
ceasing
and
without
restriction
full
well
did
the
south
know
not
only
that
the
national
government
would
probably
legislate
against
slavery
wherever
the
constitution
placed
it
within
its
reach
but
she
knew
also
that
congress
had
already
marked
out
the
line
of
national
policy
to
be
pursued
on
the
subject
had
committed
itself
before
the
world
to
a
course
of
action
against
slavery
wherever
she
could
move
upon
it
without
encountering
a
conflicting
jurisdiction
that
the
nation
had
established
by
solemn
ordinance
memorable
precedent
for
subsequent
action
by
abolishing
slavery
in
the
northwest
territory
and
by
declaring
that
it
should
never
thenceforward
exist
there
and
this
too
as
soon
as
by
cession
of
virginia
and
other
states
the
territory
came
under
congressional
control
the
south
knew
also
that
the
sixth
article
in
the
ordinance
prohibiting
slavery
was
first
proposed
by
the
largest
slaveholding
state
in
the
confederacy
that
the
chairman
of
the
committee
that
reported
the
ordinance
was
a
slaveholder
that
the
ordinance
was
enacted
by
congress
during
the
session
of
the
convention
that
formed
the
united
states
constitution
that
the
provisions
of
the
ordinance
were
both
while
in
prospect
and
when
under
discussion
matters
of
universal
notoriety
and
with
all
parties
and
when
finally
passed
received
the
vote
every
member
of
congress
from
each
of
the
slaveholding
the
south
also
had
every
reason
for
believing
that
the
first
congress
under
the
constitution
would
that
ordinance
as
it
unanimously
a
crowd
of
reflections
suggested
by
the
preceding
testimony
press
for
utterance
the
right
of
petition
ravished
and
trampled
by
its
constitutional
guardians
and
insult
and
defiance
hurled
in
the
faces
of
the
sovereign
people
while
calmly
remonstrating
servants
for
violence
committed
on
the
nation
charter
and
their
own
dearest
rights
add
to
this
the
right
of
peaceably
assembling
violently
wrested
the
rights
of
minorities
no
longer
free
speech
struck
dumb
free
outlawed
and
murdered
free
presses
cast
into
the
streets
and
their
fragments
strewed
with
shoutings
or
flourished
in
triumph
before
the
gaze
of
approving
crowds
as
proud
members
of
prostrate
law
the
spirit
and
power
of
our
fathers
where
are
they
their
deep
homage
always
and
every
where
rendered
to
free
thought
with
its
signs
free
speech
and
a
free
their
reverence
for
justice
liberty
and
law
where
are
they
but
we
turn
from
these
considerations
though
the
times
on
which
we
have
fallen
and
those
towards
which
we
are
borne
with
headlong
haste
call
for
their
discussion
as
with
the
voices
of
departing
life
and
proceed
to
topics
relevant
to
the
argument
before
us
the
seventh
article
of
the
amendments
to
the
constitution
is
alleged
to
withhold
from
congress
the
power
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
no
person
shall
be
deprived
of
life
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law
all
the
slaves
in
the
district
have
been
deprived
of
liberty
by
legislative
acts
now
these
legislative
acts
depriving
them
of
liberty
were
either
due
process
of
law
or
they
were
if
they
then
a
legislative
act
taking
from
the
master
that
property
which
is
the
identical
liberty
previously
taken
from
the
slave
would
be
due
process
of
law
and
of
course
a
act
but
if
the
legislative
acts
depriving
them
of
liberty
were
due
process
of
law
then
the
slaves
were
deprived
of
liberty
and
these
acts
are
in
that
case
the
emancipates
if
the
objector
reply
by
saying
that
the
import
of
the
phrase
due
process
of
law
is
process
solely
it
is
granted
and
that
fact
is
our
rejoinder
for
no
slave
in
the
district
been
deprived
of
his
liberty
by
a
judicial
process
or
in
other
words
by
due
process
of
law
consequently
upon
the
objector
own
admission
every
slave
in
the
district
has
been
deprived
of
liberty
and
is
therefore
by
the
this
is
asserted
only
of
the
slaves
under
the
exclusive
legislation
of
congress
the
last
clause
of
the
article
under
consideration
is
quoted
for
the
same
purpose
nor
shall
private
property
be
taken
for
public
use
without
just
compensation
each
of
the
state
constitutions
has
a
clause
of
similar
purport
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
district
by
congress
would
not
as
we
shall
presently
show
violate
this
clause
either
directly
or
by
implication
granting
for
argument
sake
that
slaves
are
private
property
and
that
to
emancipate
them
would
be
to
take
private
property
for
public
use
the
objector
admits
the
power
of
congress
to
do
provided
it
will
do
something
that
is
for
them
thus
instead
of
denying
the
the
objector
not
only
admits
but
it
as
the
ground
of
the
inference
that
compensation
must
accompany
it
so
far
from
disproving
the
existence
of
power
the
objector
asserts
the
existence
of
one
the
power
to
take
the
slaves
from
their
masters
the
other
the
power
to
take
the
property
of
the
united
states
to
pay
for
them
if
congress
can
not
constitutionally
impair
the
right
of
private
property
or
take
it
without
compensation
it
can
not
constitutionally
the
perpetration
of
such
acts
by
nor
those
who
commit
them
does
the
power
to
rob
a
man
of
his
earnings
rob
the
earner
of
his
right
to
them
who
has
a
better
right
to
the
than
the
producer
to
the
than
the
owner
of
the
to
the
hands
and
arms
than
he
from
whose
shoulders
they
swing
to
the
body
and
soul
than
he
whose
they
congress
not
only
impairs
but
annihilates
the
right
of
private
property
while
it
withholds
from
the
slaves
of
the
district
their
title
to
what
congress
powerless
to
protect
a
man
right
to
when
it
can
make
inviolable
the
right
to
a
but
waving
this
i
deny
that
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
district
would
violate
this
clause
what
does
the
clause
prohibit
the
taking
of
private
property
for
public
use
suppose
congress
should
emancipate
the
slaves
in
the
district
what
would
it
nothing
what
would
it
nothing
what
would
it
put
to
public
use
nothing
instead
of
private
property
congress
by
abolishing
slavery
would
say
shall
not
taken
and
those
who
have
been
robbed
of
it
already
shall
be
kept
out
of
it
no
longer
and
since
every
man
right
to
his
own
body
is
he
shall
be
protected
in
it
true
congress
may
not
arbitrarily
take
property
property
from
one
man
and
give
it
to
another
and
in
the
abolition
of
slavery
no
such
thing
is
done
a
legislative
act
changes
the
of
the
slave
makes
him
his
own
instead
of
the
property
of
another
it
determines
a
question
of
between
two
classes
of
persons
doing
an
act
of
justice
to
one
and
restraining
the
other
from
acts
of
injustice
or
in
other
words
preventing
one
from
robbing
the
other
by
granting
to
the
injured
party
the
protection
of
just
and
equitable
laws
congress
by
an
act
of
abolition
would
change
the
condition
of
seven
thousand
persons
in
the
district
but
would
take
nothing
to
construe
this
provision
so
as
to
enable
the
citizens
of
the
district
to
hold
as
property
and
in
perpetuity
whatever
they
please
or
to
hold
it
as
property
in
all
circumstances
all
necessity
public
welfare
and
the
will
and
power
of
the
government
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
is
a
total
perversion
of
its
whole
the
of
the
provision
was
to
throw
up
a
barrier
against
governmental
aggrandizement
the
right
to
take
property
for
is
one
thing
the
right
so
to
adjust
the
by
which
property
is
held
that
may
have
his
own
secured
to
is
another
thing
and
clearly
within
the
scope
of
legislation
besides
if
congress
were
to
take
the
slaves
in
the
district
it
would
be
not
abolishing
slavery
becoming
a
slaveholder
itself
instead
of
requiring
others
to
be
such
no
longer
the
clause
in
question
prohibits
the
taking
of
individual
property
for
public
uses
to
be
employed
or
disposed
of
as
property
for
governmental
purposes
congress
by
abolishing
slavery
in
the
district
would
do
no
such
thing
it
would
merely
change
the
of
that
which
has
been
recognised
as
a
qualified
property
by
congressional
acts
though
previously
declared
persons
by
the
constitution
more
than
this
is
done
continually
by
congress
and
every
other
legislature
property
the
most
absolute
and
unqualified
is
annihilated
by
legislative
acts
the
embargo
and
act
prostrated
at
a
stroke
a
forest
of
shipping
and
sunk
millions
of
capital
to
say
nothing
of
the
power
of
congress
to
take
hundreds
of
millions
from
the
people
by
direct
taxation
who
doubts
its
power
to
abolish
at
once
the
whole
tariff
system
change
the
seat
of
government
arrest
the
progress
of
national
works
prohibit
any
branch
of
commerce
with
the
indian
tribes
or
with
foreign
nations
change
the
locality
of
forts
arsenals
magazines
dock
yards
to
abolish
the
post
office
system
the
privilege
of
patents
and
copyrights
by
such
acts
congress
might
in
the
exercise
of
its
acknowledged
powers
annihilate
property
to
an
incalculable
amount
and
that
without
becoming
liable
to
claims
for
compensation
finally
this
clause
prohibits
the
taking
for
public
use
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
does
not
recognise
slaves
as
property
any
where
and
it
does
not
recognise
them
in
in
the
district
of
columbia
all
allusions
to
them
in
the
constitution
recognise
them
as
persons
every
reference
to
them
points
to
the
element
of
and
thus
by
the
strongest
implication
declares
that
the
constitution
them
only
as
persons
and
not
recognise
them
in
any
other
light
if
they
escape
into
free
states
the
constitution
authorizes
their
being
taken
back
but
how
not
as
the
property
of
an
owner
but
as
persons
and
the
peculiarity
of
the
expression
is
a
marked
recognition
of
their
a
refusal
to
recognise
them
as
chattels
persons
to
service
are
to
service
that
can
be
affirmed
only
of
again
slaves
give
political
power
as
persons
the
constitution
in
settling
the
principle
of
representation
requires
their
enumeration
in
the
census
how
as
property
then
why
not
include
race
horses
and
game
cocks
slaves
like
other
inhabitants
are
enumerated
as
persons
so
by
the
constitution
the
government
was
pledged
to
with
the
migration
or
importation
of
such
persons
as
the
states
might
think
proper
to
admit
until
and
authorized
the
laying
of
a
tax
on
each
person
so
admitted
further
slaves
are
recognised
as
by
the
exaction
of
their
to
the
government
for
offences
against
the
government
slaves
are
tried
as
as
persons
they
are
entitled
to
counsel
for
their
defence
to
the
rules
of
evidence
and
to
due
process
of
law
and
as
they
are
punished
true
they
are
loaded
with
cruel
disabilities
in
courts
of
law
such
as
greatly
obstruct
and
often
inevitably
defeat
the
ends
of
justice
yet
they
are
still
recognised
as
even
in
the
legislation
of
congress
and
in
the
diplomacy
of
the
general
government
notwithstanding
the
frequent
and
wide
departures
from
the
integrity
of
the
constitution
on
this
subject
slaves
are
not
recognised
as
without
qualification
congress
has
always
refused
to
grant
compensation
for
slaves
killed
or
taken
by
the
enemy
even
when
these
slaves
had
been
impressed
into
the
united
states
service
in
half
a
score
of
cases
since
the
last
war
congress
has
rejected
such
applications
for
compensation
besides
both
in
congressional
acts
and
in
our
national
diplomacy
slaves
and
property
are
not
used
as
convertible
terms
when
mentioned
in
treaties
and
state
papers
it
is
in
such
a
way
as
to
distinguish
them
from
mere
property
and
generally
by
a
recognition
of
their
in
the
invariable
recognition
of
slaves
as
the
united
states
constitution
caught
the
mantle
of
the
glorious
declaration
and
most
worthily
wears
it
recognizes
all
human
beings
as
men
persons
and
thus
as
equals
in
the
original
draft
of
the
declaration
as
it
came
from
the
hand
of
jefferson
it
is
alleged
that
great
britain
had
waged
a
cruel
war
against
nature
itself
violating
its
most
sacred
rights
of
life
and
liberty
in
the
persons
of
a
distant
people
carrying
them
into
slavery
determined
to
keep
up
a
market
where
men
should
be
bought
and
sold
thus
disdaining
to
make
the
charter
of
freedom
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
that
they
might
be
shorn
both
of
liberty
and
humanity
the
celebrated
roger
sherman
one
of
the
committee
of
five
appointed
to
draft
the
declaration
of
independence
and
also
a
member
of
the
convention
that
formed
the
united
states
constitution
said
in
the
first
congress
after
its
adoption
the
constitution
not
consider
these
persons
slaves
a
species
of
lloyd
cong
reg
p
that
the
united
states
constitution
does
not
make
slaves
property
is
shown
in
the
fact
that
no
person
either
as
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
or
by
having
his
domicile
within
the
united
states
government
can
hold
slaves
he
can
hold
them
only
by
deriving
his
power
from
laws
or
from
the
laws
of
congress
if
he
hold
slaves
within
the
district
but
no
person
resident
within
the
united
states
jurisdiction
and
not
within
the
district
nor
within
a
state
whose
laws
support
slavery
nor
held
to
service
under
the
laws
of
such
state
or
district
having
escaped
therefrom
be
held
as
a
men
can
hold
under
the
united
states
government
though
residing
beyond
the
bounds
of
any
state
district
or
territory
an
inhabitant
of
the
wisconsin
territory
can
hold
property
there
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
but
he
can
not
hold
there
under
the
united
states
laws
nor
by
virtue
of
the
united
states
constitution
nor
upon
the
ground
of
his
united
states
citizenship
nor
by
having
his
domicile
within
the
united
states
jurisdiction
the
constitution
no
where
recognizes
the
right
to
slave
property
merely
the
fact
that
the
states
have
jurisdiction
each
in
its
own
limits
and
that
there
are
certain
persons
within
their
jurisdictions
held
to
service
by
their
own
finally
in
the
clause
under
consideration
private
property
is
not
to
be
taken
without
compensation
just
if
justice
is
to
be
appealed
to
in
determining
the
amount
of
compensation
let
her
determine
the
also
if
it
be
her
province
to
say
compensation
is
just
it
is
hers
to
say
whether
is
just
whether
the
slave
is
just
property
rather
than
a
then
if
justice
adjudges
the
slave
to
be
private
property
it
adjudges
him
to
be
property
since
the
right
to
one
is
the
first
right
the
source
of
all
others
the
original
stock
by
which
they
are
accumulated
the
principal
of
which
they
are
the
interest
and
since
the
slave
private
property
has
been
taken
and
since
compensation
is
impossible
there
being
no
for
self
the
least
that
can
be
done
is
to
restore
to
him
his
original
private
property
having
shown
that
in
abolishing
slavery
property
would
not
be
taken
for
public
use
it
may
be
added
that
in
those
states
where
slavery
has
been
abolished
by
law
no
claim
for
compensation
has
been
allowed
indeed
the
manifest
absurdity
of
demanding
it
seems
to
have
quite
forstalled
the
of
such
a
claim
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
district
instead
of
being
a
legislative
anomaly
would
proceed
upon
the
principles
of
every
day
legislation
it
has
been
shown
already
that
the
united
states
constitution
does
not
recognize
slaves
as
property
yet
ordinary
legislation
is
full
of
precedents
showing
that
even
property
is
in
many
respects
wholly
subject
to
legislation
the
repeal
of
the
law
of
entailments
all
those
acts
that
control
the
alienation
of
property
its
disposal
by
will
its
passing
to
heirs
by
descent
with
the
question
who
shall
be
heirs
and
what
shall
be
the
rule
of
distribution
among
them
or
whether
property
shall
be
transmitted
at
all
by
descent
rather
than
escheat
to
the
state
these
with
statutes
of
limitation
and
various
other
classes
of
legislative
acts
serve
to
illustrate
the
acknowledged
scope
of
the
power
even
where
property
in
every
sense
persons
whose
property
is
thus
affected
by
public
laws
receive
from
the
government
no
compensation
for
their
losses
unless
the
state
has
been
put
in
possession
of
the
property
taken
from
them
the
preamble
of
the
united
states
constitution
declares
it
to
be
a
fundamental
object
of
the
organization
of
the
government
to
establish
justice
has
congress
to
do
that
for
which
it
was
made
the
of
can
not
the
united
states
government
fulfil
the
purpose
which
it
was
brought
into
to
abolish
slavery
is
to
take
from
no
rightful
owner
his
property
but
to
between
two
parties
to
emancipate
the
slave
is
to
between
him
and
his
master
to
throw
around
the
person
character
conscience
liberty
and
domestic
relations
of
the
one
same
that
secures
and
blesses
the
other
in
other
words
to
prevent
by
one
class
of
men
from
seizing
upon
another
class
and
robbing
them
at
pleasure
of
their
earnings
their
time
their
liberty
their
kindred
and
the
very
use
and
ownership
of
their
own
persons
finally
to
abolish
slavery
is
to
proclaim
and
that
innocence
and
helplessness
now
are
entitled
to
and
that
power
avarice
and
lust
shall
no
longer
gorge
upon
their
spoils
under
the
license
and
by
the
ministrations
of
congress
by
possessing
exclusive
legislation
in
all
cases
whatsoever
has
a
protective

all
the
inhabitants
of
the

if
it
has
no
power

it

if
it

it

and
is

it
all
admit
the
power
of
congress
to
protect
the
masters
in
the

against
their
slaves
what
part
of
the
constitution
gives
the
power
the
clause
so
often
quoted
power
of
legislation
in
all
cases
whatsoever
equally
in
the
of
defending
the

as
in
that
of

whites
against
the

the
power
is
given
also
by

congress
shall
have

a

as
well

against

as

against

if
the
constitution
gives
power
to

class
against
the

it
gives
power
to

suppose
the

in
the
district
should
seize
the

drive
them
into
the
fields
and
kitchens
force
them
to
work
without
pay
flog
them
imprison
them
and

at
their
pleasure
where
would
congress
find
power
to
restrain
such
acts
answer
a
power
in
the
clause
so
often
cited
and
an
one
in
that
cited
above
congress
shall
have
power
to
suppress
insurrections
so
much
for
a
case
here
follows
a
one
the
whites
in
the
district
perpetrating
these
identical
upon
seven
thousand
blacks
daily
that
congress
has
power
to
restrain
these
acts
in
case
all
assert
and
in
so
doing
they
assert
the
power
in
cases
whatsoever
for
the
grant
of
power
to
suppress
insurrections
is
an
grant
not
hampered
by
provisos
as
to
the
color
shape
size
sex
language
creed
or
condition
of
the
insurgents
congress
derives
its
power
to
suppress
this
insurrection
from
the
same
source
whence
it
derived
its
power
to
suppress
the
acts
in
the
case
if
one
case
is
an
insurrection
the
other
is
the
in
both
are
the
same
the
only
are
different
in
the
one
case
ignorant
and
degraded
goaded
by
the
memory
of
the
past
stung
by
the
present
and
driven
to
desperation
by
the
fearful
looking
for
of
wrongs
for
ever
to
come
in
the
other
enlightened
into
the
nature
of
the
principles
of
justice
and
the
dictates
of
the
law
of
love
unprovoked
by
wrongs
with
cool
deliberation
and
by
system
they
perpetrate
these
acts
upon
those
to
whom
they
owe
unnumbered
obligations
for
of
unrequited
service
on
which
side
may
palliation
be
pleaded
and
which
party
may
most
reasonably
claim
an
abatement
of
the
rigors
of
law
if
congress
has
power
to
suppress
such
acts
it
has
power
to
suppress
them
all
it
has
been
shown
already
that
is
exacted
of
the
slave
is
the
government
of
the
united
states
unable
to
grant
where
it
exacts
it
is
an
axiom
of
the
civilized
world
and
a
maxim
even
with
savages
that
allegiance
and
protection
are
reciprocal
and
correlative
are
principles
powerless
with
us
which
exact
homage
of
barbarians
is
constitutional
right
every
human
being
under
the
exclusive
legislation
of
congress
who
has
not
forfeited
it
by
in
conclusion
i
argue
the
power
of
congress
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
from
art
sec
clause
of
the
constitution
congress
shall
have
power
to
provide
for
the
common
defence
and
the
general
welfare
of
the
united
states
has
the
government
of
the
united
states
no
power
under
this
grant
to
legislate
within
its
own
exclusive
jurisdiction
on
subjects
that
vitally
affect
its
interests
suppose
the
slaves
in
the
district
should
rise
upon
their
masters
and
the
united
states
government
in
quelling
the
insurrection
should
kill
any
number
of
them
could
their
masters
claim
compensation
of
the
government
manifestly
not
even
though
no
proof
existed
that
the
particular
slaves
killed
were
insurgents
this
was
precisely
the
point
at
issue
between
those
masters
whose
slaves
were
killed
by
the
state
troops
at
the
time
of
the
southampton
insurrection
and
the
virginia
legislature
no
evidence
was
brought
to
show
that
the
slaves
killed
by
the
troops
were
insurgents
yet
the
virginia
legislature
decided
that
their
masters
were
entitled
to
they
proceeded
on
the
sound
principle
that
a
government
may
in
destroy
the
claim
of
its
subjects
even
to
that
which
has
been
recognized
as
property
by
its
own
acts
if
in
providing
for
the
common
defence
the
united
government
in
the
case
supposed
would
have
power
to
destroy
slaves
both
as
and
it
surely
might
stop
destroy
them
while
it
legalized
their
existence
as
and
thus
provided
for
the
common
defence
by
giving
them
a
personal
and
powerful
interest
in
the
government
and
securing
their
strength
for
its
defence
like
other
legislatures
congress
has
power
to
abate
nuisances
to
remove
or
tear
down
unsafe
buildings
to
destroy
infected
cargoes
to
lay
injunctions
upon
manufactories
injurious
to
the
public
health
and
thus
to
provide
for
the
common
defence
and
general
welfare
by
destroying
individual
property
when
such
property
puts
in
jeopardy
the
public
weal
granting
for
argument
sake
that
slaves
are
property
in
the
district
of
columbia
if
congress
has
a
right
to
annihilate
property
in
the
district
when
the
public
safety
requires
it
it
may
surely
annihilate
its
existence
property
when
the
public
safety
requires
it
especially
if
it
transform

a

as
perilled

win

by
emancipating

the

and
no
marvel
for
thousands
of
the
inhabitants
of

transformed

the

its
constitutional

to
provide

to

by
turning

into

hostile
ambush
lurking
in

thicket
inviting
assault

secret
foes
in

paralyzing

an
army
of
allies
would
have
rallied
in

of
her
calamity
and
shouted
defiance
from
their
munitions
of
rocks
whilst

of
the
republic
then
trampled
in
dust
would
have
floated
securely
over
freemen
exulting
amidst
bulwarks
of
strength
to
show
that
congress
can
abolish

in

district

the
grant
of
power
to
provide
for

i
quote
an
extract
from
a
speech
of
madison
of
in
the
first
congress
under
the
constitution
may
speaking
of
the
abolition
of
the
slave
trade
madison
says
i
should
venture
to
say
it
is
as
much
for
the
interests
of
georgia
and
south
carolina
as
of
any
state
in
the
union
every
addition
they
receive
to
their
number
of
slaves
tends
to
them
and
renders
them
less
capable
of
in
case
of
hostilities
with
foreign
nations
they
will
be
the
means
of
attack
instead
of
repelling
invasion
it
is
a
necessary
duty
of
the
general
government
to
protect
every
part
of
the
empire
against
danger
as
well
as
external
thing
therefore
which
tends
to
increase
this
danger
though
it
may
be
a
local
affair
yet
if
it
involves
national
expense
or
safety
it
becomes
of
concern
to
every
part
of
the
union
and
is
a
proper
subject
for
the
consideration
of
those
charged
with
the
general
administration
of
the
see
cong
reg
vol
postscript
my
apology
for
adding
a
to
a
discussion
already
perhaps
too
protracted
is
the
fact
that
the
preceding
sheets
were
in
the
hands
of
the
printer
and
all
but
the
concluding
pages
had
gone
through
the
press
before
the
passage
of
calhoun
late
resolutions
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
a
proceeding
so
extraordinary
if
indeed
the
time
has
not
passed
when
acts
of
congress
in
derogation
of
freedom
and
in
deference
to
slavery
can
be
deemed
extraordinary
should
not
be
suffered
to
pass
in
silence
at
such
a
crisis
as
the
present
especially
as
the
passage
of
one
of
the
resolutions
by
a
vote
of
to
exhibits
a
shift
of
position
on
the
part
of
the
south
as
sudden
as
it
is
unaccountable
being
nothing
less
than
the
surrender
of
a
fortress
which
until
then
they
had
defended
with
the
pertinacity
of
a
blind
and
almost
infuriated
fatuity
upon
the
discussions
during
the
pendency
of
the
resolutions
and
upon
the
vote
by
which
they
were
carried
i
make
no
comment
save
only
to
record
my
exultation
in
the
fact
there
exhibited
that
great
emergencies
are
and
that
henceforward
until
this
question
is
settled
whoever
holds
a
seat
in
congress
will
find
upon
and
all
around
him
a
pressure
strong
enough
to
test
him
a
focal
blaze
that
will
find
its
way
through
the
carefully
adjusted
cloak
of
fair
pretension
and
the
sevenfold
brass
of
political
intrigue
and
piercing
to
the
dividing
asunder
of
joints
and
marrow
be
it
known
to
every
northern
man
who
aspires
to
a
seat
in
congress
that
hereafter
it
is
the
destiny
of
congressional
action
on
this
subject
to
be
a
mighty
revelator
making
secret
thoughts
public
property
and
proclaiming
on
the
what
is
whispered
in
the
ear
smiting
off
masks
and
bursting
open
sepulchres
beautiful
outwardly
and
heaving
up
to
the
sun
their
dead
men
bones
to
such
we
say
the
missouri
question
and
the
fate
of
those
who
then
sold
the
north
and
their
own
passing
by
the
resolutions
generally
without
remark
the
attention
of
the
reader
is
specially
solicited
to
clay
substitute
for
calhoun
fifth
resolution
resolved
that
when
the
district
of
columbia
was
ceded
by
the
states
of
virginia
and
maryland
to
the
united
states
domestic
slavery
existed
in
both
of
these
states
including
the
ceded
territory
and
that
as
it
still
continues
in
both
of
them
it
could
not
be
abolished
within
the
district
without
a
violation
of
that
good
faith
which
was
implied
in
the
cession
and
in
the
acceptance
of
the
territory
nor
unless
compensation
were
made
to
the
proprietors
of
slaves
without
a
manifest
infringement
of
an
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
nor
without
exciting
a
degree
of
just
alarm
and
apprehension
in
the
states
recognizing
slavery
far
transcending
in
mischievous
tendency
any
possible
benefit
which
could
be
accomplished
by
the
abolition
by
voting
for
this
resolution
the
south
by
a
simultaneous
movement
shifted
its
mode
of
defense
not
so
much
by
taking
a
position
entirely
new
as
by
attempting
to
refortify
an
old
one
never
much
trusted
in
and
abandoned
mainly
long
ago
as
being
unable
to
hold
out
against
assault
however
unskilfully
directed
in
the
debate
on
this
resolution
though
the
southern
members
of
congress
did
not
retreat
from
the
ground
hitherto
maintained
by
them
that
congress
has
no
power
by
the
constitution
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
yet
in
the
main
they
silently
drew
off
from
it
the
passage
of
this
resolution
with
the
vote
of
every
southern
senator
forms
a
new
era
in
the
discussion
of
this
question
we
can
not
join
in
the
lamentations
of
those
who
bewail
it
we
hail
it
and
rejoice
in
it
it
was
as
we
would
have
had
it
offered
by
a
southern
senator
advocated
by
southern
senators
and
on
the
ground
that
it
was
no
compromise
that
it
embodied
the
true
southern
principle
that
this
resolution
stood
on
as
high
ground
as
calhoun
preston
that
clay
resolution
was
as
strong
as
calhoun
rives
that
the
resolution
he
calhoun
now
refused
to
support
was
as
strong
as
his
own
and
that
in
supporting
it
there
was
no
abandonment
of
principle
by
the
mr
walker
of
mi
further
that
it
was
advocated
by
the
southern
senators
generally
as
an
expression
of
their
views
and
as
setting
the
question
of
slavery
in
the
district
on
its
ground
that
finally
when
the
question
was
taken
every
slaveholding
senator
including
calhoun
himself
voted
for
the
resolution
by
passing
this
resolution
and
with
such
avowals
the
south
has
surrendered
irrevocably
the
whole
question
at
issue
between
them
and
the
petitioners
for
abolition
in
the
district
it
has
unwittingly
but
explicitly
conceded
the
main
question
argued
in
the
preceding
pages
the
ground
taken
against
the
right
of
congress
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
is
that
it
existed
in
maryland
and
virginia
when
the
cession
was
made
and
it
still
continues
in
both
of
it
could
not
be
abolished
without
a
violation
of
that
good
faith
which
was
implied
in
the
cession
the
is
that
exclusive
has
no
power
to
abolish
slavery
within
its
jurisdiction
that
the
powers
of
even
can
not
do
it
that
the
clause
granting
congress
exclusive
legislation
in
all
cases
whatsoever
over
such
district
gives
no
power
to
do
it
but
that
the
of
one
of
the
parties
that
the
other
would
not
in
cases
the
power
which
said
party
had
consented
be
all
the
use
of
it
the
only
cardinal
point
in
the
discussion
is
here
not
only
but
formally
laid
down
by
the
south
as
the
leading
article
in
their
creed
on
the
question
of
congressional
jurisdiction
over
slavery
in
the
district
the
given
why
congress
should
not
abolish
and
the
sole
evidence
that
if
it
did
such
abolition
would
be
a
violation
of
good
faith
is
that
still
continues
in
those
thus
explicitly
admitting
that
if
slavery
did
still
continue
in
those
states
congress
abolish
it
in
the
district
the
same
admission
is
made
also
in
the
which
state
that
slavery
existed
in
those
states
the
time
of
the
admitting
that
if
it
had
existed
there
then
but
had
grown
up
in
the
district
under
states
congress
might
constitutionally
abolish
it
or
that
if
the
ceded
parts
of
those
states
had
been
the
parts
in
which
slaves
were
held
under
their
laws
congress
might
have
abolished
in
such
a
contingency
also
the
cession
in
that
case
leaving
no
slaves
in
those
states
no
good
faith
would
be
implied
in
it
nor
any
violated
by
an
act
of
abolition
the
principle
of
the
resolution
makes
this
further
admission
that
if
maryland
and
virginia
should
at
once
abolish
their
slavery
congress
might
at
once
abolish
it
in
the
district
the
principle
goes
even
further
than
this
and
congress
in
such
case
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
by
the
faith
in
the
cession
and
acceptance
of
the
territory
since
according
to
the
spirit
and
scope
of
the
resolution
this
implied
good
faith
of
maryland
and
virginia
in
making
the
cession
was
that
congress
would
do
nothing
within
the
district
which
should
go
to
counteract
the
policy
or
bring
into
disrepute
the
institutions
or
call
in
question
the
usages
or
even
in
any
way
ruffle
the
prejudices
of
those
states
or
do
what
might
think
would
unfavorably
bear
upon
their
interests
of
course
being
the
judges
but
let
us
dissect
another
limb
of
the
resolution
what
is
to
be
understood
by
that
good
faith
which
was
implied
it
is
of
course
an
admission
that
such
a
condition
was
not
in
the
acts
of
cession
that
in
their
there
is
nothing
restricting
the
power
of
congress
on
the
subject
of
slavery
in
the
district
not
a
word
alluding
to
it
nor
one
inserted
with
such
an
this
implied
faith
then
rests
on
no
clause
or
word
in
the
united
states
constitution
or
in
the
acts
of
cession
or
in
the
acts
of
congress
accepting
the
cession
nor
does
it
rest
on
any
declarations
of
the
legislatures
of
maryland
and
virginia
made
at
the
time
or
in
that
generation
nor
on
any
of
theirs
nor
on
any
declaration
of
the
people
of
those
states
nor
on
the
testimony
of
the
washingtons
jeffersons
madisons
chaces
martins
and
jennifers
of
those
states
and
times
the
assertion
rests
itself
clay
and
the
other
senators
who
voted
for
the
resolution
that
maryland
and
virginia
supposed
that
congress
would
by
no
means
the
power
given
them
by
the
constitution
except
in
such
ways
as
would
be
well
pleasing
in
the
eyes
of
those
states
especially
as
one
of
them
was
the
ancient
dominion
and
now
after
the
lapse
of
half
a
century
this
of
maryland
and
virginia
the
existence
of
which
is
mere
matter
of
conjecture
with
the
senators
is
conjured
up
and
duly
installed
upon
the
of
final
appeal
before
whose
nod
constitutions
are
to
flee
away
and
with
whom
solemn
grants
of
power
and
explicit
guaranties
are
when
weighed
in
the
balance
altogether
lighter
than
vanity
but
let
us
survey
it
in
another
light
why
did
maryland
and
virginia
leave
so
much
to
be
why
did
they
not
in
some
way
express
what
lay
so
near
their
hearts
had
their
vocabulary
run
so
low
that
a
single
word
could
not
be
eked
out
for
the
occasion
or
were
those
states
so
bashful
of
a
sudden
that
they
dare
not
speak
out
and
tell
what
they
wanted
or
did
they
take
it
for
granted
that
congress
would
always
act
in
the
premises
according
to
their
wishes
and
that
too
without
their
their
wishes
if
as
honorable
senators
tell
us
maryland
and
virginia
did
verily
travail
with
such
abounding
why
brought
they
forth
no
it
is
as
true
in
as
in
religion
that
the
only
of
faith
is
and
that
faith
works
is
has
no
but
here
forsooth
a
blind
implication
with
nothing
an
implied
without
works
is
clay
is
lawyer
enough
to
know
that
even
a
as
to
what
must
have
been
the
of
maryland
and
virginia
about
congressional
exercise
of
constitutional
power
no
and
that
to
plead
it
in
a
court
of
law
would
be
of
small
service
except
to
jostle
their
honors
gravity
he
need
not
be
told
that
the
constitution
gives
congress
power
to
exercise
exclusive
legislation
in
all
cases
whatsoever
over
such
district
nor
that
the
legislatures
of
maryland
and
virginia
constructed
their
acts
of
cession
with
this
clause
their
and
that
both
of
them
declared
those
acts
made
in
of
said
clause
those
states
were
aware
that
the
united
states
in
their
constitution
had
left
nothing
to
be
as
to
the
power
of
congress
over
the
district
an
admonition
quite
sufficient
one
would
think
to
put
them
on
their
guard
and
induce
them
to
eschew
vague
implications
and
resort
to
full
well
did
they
know
also
that
those
were
times
when
in
matters
of
high
import
was
left
to
be
implied
the
colonies
were
then
panting
from
a
twenty
years
conflict
with
the
mother
country
about
bills
of
rights
charters
treaties
constitutions
grants
limitations
and
of
the
severities
of
a
long
and
terrible
discipline
had
taught
them
to
guard
at
all
points
that
their
exact
import
and
limit
might
be
leaving
no
scope
for
a
blind
faith
that
in
the
lottery
of
chances
there
would
be
no
blanks
but
making
all
sure
by
the
use
of
explicit
terms
and
wisely
chosen
words
and
of
them
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
with
its
amendments
those
of
the
individual
states
the
national
treaties
the
public
documents
of
the
general
and
state
governments
at
that
period
show
the
universal
conviction
of
legislative
bodies
that
when
great
public
interest
were
at
stake
nothing
should
be
left
to
be
implied
further
suppose
maryland
and
virginia
had
expressed
their
implied
faith
in
and
embodied
it
in
their
acts
of
cession
as
a
proviso
declaring
that
congress
should
not
exercise
exclusive
legislation
in
cases
whatsoever
over
the
district
but
that
the
case
of
should
be
an
exception
who
does
not
know
that
congress
if
it
had
accepted
the
cession
on
those
terms
would
have
violated
the
constitution
and
who
that
has
ever
studied
the
free
mood
of
those
times
in
its
bearings
on
slavery
proofs
of
which
are
given
in
scores
on
the
preceding
pages
can
for
an
instant
believe
that
the
people
of
the
united
states
would
have
altered
their
constitution
for
the
purpose
of
providing
for
slavery
an
inviolable
sanctuary
that
when
driven
in
from
its
outposts
and
everywhere
retreating
discomfited
before
the
march
of
freedom
it
might
be
received
into
everlasting
habitations
on
the
common
homestead
and
of
this
free
republic
besides
who
can
believe
that
virginia
made
such
a
condition
or
cherished
such
a
purpose
when
at
that
very
moment
washington
jefferson
wythe
patrick
henry
george
tucker
and
almost
all
her
illustrious
men
were
advocating
the
abolition
of
slavery
by
law
when
washington
had
said
two
years
before
maryland
and
virginia
must
have
laws
for
the
gradual
abolition
of
slavery
and
at
a
period
and
when
jefferson
in
his
letter
to
price
three
years
before
the
cession
had
said
speaking
of
virginia
this
is
the
next
state
to
which
we
may
turn
our
eyes
for
the
interesting
spectacle
of
justice
in
conflict
with
avarice
and
oppression
a
conflict
in
which
the
sacred
side
is
gaining
daily
recruits
when
voluntary
emancipations
on
the
soil
were
then
progressing
at
the
rate
of
between
one
and
two
thousand
annually
see
judge
tucker
dissertation
on
slavery
when
the
public
sentiment
of
virginia
had
undergone
and
was
undergoing
so
mighty
a
revolution
that
the
idea
of
the
continuance
of
slavery
as
a
permanent
system
could
not
be
though
she
then
contained
about
half
the
slaves
in
the
union
was
this
the
time
to
stipulated
for
the
of
slavery
under
the
exclusive
legislation
of
congress
and
that
too
at
the
session
of
congress
when
of
her
delegation
voted
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
north
west
territory
a
territory
which
she
had
herself
ceded
to
congress
and
along
with
it
had
surrendered
her
jurisdiction
over
many
of
her
citizens
inhabitants
of
that
territory
who
held
slaves
there
and
whose
slaves
were
emancipated
by
that
act
of
congress
in
which
all
her
delegation
with
one
accord
participated
now
in
view
of
the
universal
belief
then
prevalent
that
slavery
in
this
country
was
doomed
to
short
life
and
especially
that
in
maryland
and
virginia
it
would
be
abolished
are
we
to
be
told
that
those
states
to
bind
congress
to
terminate
it
are
we
to
adopt
the
monstrous
conclusion
that
this
was
the
intent
of
the
ancient
dominion
thus
to
the
united
states
by
an
implied
faith
and
that
when
the
united
states
the
cession
she
did
solemnly
thus
plight
her
troth
and
that
virginia
did
then
so
it
verily
one
would
think
that
honorable
senators
supposed
themselves
deputed
to
do
our
as
well
as
our
legislation
or
rather
that
they
themselves
were
absolved
from
such
drudgery
by
virtue
of
their
office
another
absurdity
of
this
dogma
about
implied
faith
is
that
where
there
was
no
power
to
exact
an
pledge
there
was
none
to
demand
an
one
and
where
there
was
no
power
to
the
one
there
was
none
to
give
the
we
have
shown
already
that
congress
could
not
have
accepted
the
cession
with
such
a
condition
to
have
signed
away
a
part
of
its
constitutional
grant
of
power
would
have
been
a
of
the
constitution
further
the
congress
which
accepted
the
cession
was
competent
to
pass
a
resolution
pledging
itself
not
to
the
power
over
the
district
committed
to
it
by
the
constitution
but
here
its
power
ended
its
resolution
would
only
bind
could
it
bind
the
congress
by
its
authority
could
the
members
of
one
congress
say
to
the
members
of
another
because
we
do
not
choose
to
exercise
all
the
authority
vested
in
us
by
the
constitution
therefore
you
not
this
would
have
been
a
prohibition
to
do
what
the
constitution
gives
power
to
do
each
successive
congress
would
still
have
gone
to
the
constitution
for
its
power
brushing
away
in
its
course
the
cobwebs
stretched
across
its
path
by
the
officiousness
of
an
impertinent
predecessor
again
the
legislatures
of
virginia
and
maryland
had
no
power
to
bind
congress
either
by
an
express
or
an
implied
pledge
never
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
those
legislatures
had
no
power
to
bind
never
to
abolish
slavery
within
their
own
territories
the
ceded
parts
included
where
then
would
they
get
power
to
bind
not
to
do
what
they
had
no
power
to
bind
themselves
not
to
do
if
a
legislature
could
not
in
this
respect
control
the
successive
legislatures
of
its
own
state
could
it
control
the
successive
congresses
of
the
united
states
but
perhaps
we
shall
be
told
that
the
implied
faith
in
the
acts
of
cession
of
maryland
and
virginia
was
that
congress
should
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
but
that
it
should
not
do
it
until
had
done
it
within
their
bounds
verily
this
faith
comes
little
short
of
the
faith
of
miracles
a
good
rule
that
works
both
ways
first
maryland
and
virginia
have
good
faith
that
congress
will
abolish
until
do
and
then
just
as
good
faith
that
congress
abolish
they
do
excellently
accommodated
did
those
states
suppose
that
congress
would
legislate
over
the
national
domain
the
common
jurisdiction
of
for
maryland
and
virginia
alone
and
who
did
they
suppose
would
be
judges
in
the
matter
themselves
merely
or
the
whole
union
this
good
faith
implied
in
the
cession
is
no
longer
of
doubtful
interpretation
the
principle
at
the
bottom
of
it
when
fairly
stated
is
this
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
are
bound
in
good
faith
to
do
in
the
district
of
columbia
without
demurring
just
what
and
when
maryland
and
virginia
do
in
their
own
states
in
short
that
the
general
government
is
eased
of
all
the
burdens
of
legislation
within
its
exclusive
jurisdiction
save
that
of
hiring
a
scrivener
to
copy
off
the
acts
of
the
maryland
and
virginia
legislatures
as
fast
as
they
are
passed
and
engross
them
under
the
title
of
laws
of
the
united
states
for
the
district
of
columbia
a
slight
additional
expense
would
also
be
incurred
in
keeping
up
an
express
between
the
capitols
of
those
states
and
washington
city
bringing
congress
from
time
to
time
its
from
head
quarters
instructions
not
to
be
disregarded
without
a
violation
of
that
good
faith
implied
in
the
cession
this
sets
in
strong
light
the
advantages
of
our
glorious
union
if
the
doctrine
of
clay
and
the
senators
be
orthodox
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
been
permitted
to
set
up
at
their
own
expense
and
on
their
own
territory
two
great
called
senate
chamber
and
representatives
hall
for
the
purpose
of
sending
abroad
by
authority
echoes
of
legislation
permitted
also
to
keep
in
their
pay
a
corps
of
pliant
musicians
with
peremptory
instructions
to
sound
on
any
line
of
the
staff
according
as
virginia
and
maryland
may
give
the
key
note
though
this
may
have
the
seeming
of
mere
raillery
yet
an
analysis
of
the
resolution
and
of
the
discussions
upon
it
will
convince
every
fair
mind
that
it
is
but
the
legitimate
carrying
out
of
the
pervading
both
they
proceed
virtually
upon
the
hypothesis
that
the
will
and
pleasure
of
virginia
and
maryland
are
to
those
of
the
if
the
main
design
of
setting
apart
a
federal
district
had
been
originally
the
accommodation
of
maryland
virginia
and
the
south
with
the
united
states
as
an
to
consummate
the
object
there
could
hardly
have
been
higher
assumption
or
louder
vaunting
the
sole
object
of
such
a
district
was
in
effect
totally
perverted
in
the
resolution
of
clay
and
in
the
discussions
of
the
entire
southern
delegation
upon
its
passage
instead
of
taking
the
ground
that
the
benefit
of
the
whole
union
was
the
sole
of
a
federal
district
that
it
was
designed
to
guard
and
promote
the
interests
of
the
states
and
that
it
was
to
be
legislated
over
this
the
resolution
proceeds
upon
an
hypothesis
the
it
takes
a
single
point
of
policy
and
exalts
it
above
national
interests
utterly
overshadowing
them
abrogating
national
making
void
a
clause
of
the
constitution
humbling
the
general
government
into
a
subject
crouching
for
favors
to
a
superior
and
that
too
its
own
exclusive
all
the
attributes
of
sovereignty
vested
in
congress
by
the
constitution
it
impales
upon
the
point
of
an
alleged
and
this
is
clay
to
appease
the
lust
of
power
and
the
ravenings
of
state
encroachment
a
compromise
forsooth
that
sinks
the
general
government
on
own
into
a
mere
colony
with
virginia
and
maryland
for
its
mother
country
it
is
refreshing
to
turn
from
these
shallow
distorted
constructions
and
servile
cringings
to
the
high
bearing
of
other
southern
men
in
other
times
men
who
in
their
character
of
legislators
and

disdained
to
accommodate
their
interpretations
of
constitutions
and
charters
to
geographical
lines
or
to
bend
them
to
the
purposes
of

hon
william
pinkney
late
of
baltimore
and

walter
jones
of
washington
city
with
other

lawyers
prepared
an
elaborate
written
opinion
from
which
the
following
is
an
extract
nor
is
there
any
danger
to
be
apprehended
from
allowing
to
congressional
legislation
with
regard
to
the
district
of
columbia
its
fullest
effect
congress
is
responsible
to
the
states
and
to
the
people
for
that
legislation
it
is
in
truth
the
legislation
of
the
states
over
a
district
placed
under
their
control
for
own
not
for
that
of
the
district
except
as
the
prosperity
of
the
district
is
involved
and
necessary
to
the
life
of
pinkney
p
the
profound
legal
opinion
from
which
this
is
an
extract
was
elaborated
at
great
length
many
years
since
by
a
number
of
the
most
distinguished
lawyers
in
the
united
states
whose
signatures
are
appended
to
it
it
is
specific
and
to
the
point
it
asserts
that
congressional
legislation
over
the
district
is
the
legislation
of
the
and
the
not
of
states
and
a
mere
of
the
people
over
a
district
placed
under
control
under
the
control
of
the
of
the
states
not
under
the
control
of
of
them
that
it
was
thus
put
under
their
control
their
own
the
benefit
of
all
the
states
not
to
secure
special
benefits
to
maryland
and
virginia
or
what
it
might
be
they
would
regard
as
benefits
it
concludes
by
asserting
that
the
design
of
this
exclusive
control
of
congress
over
the
district
was
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
except
as
that
is
with
and
means
of
the
advantage
if
this
is
the
case
with
the
which
is
concerned
it
is
so
with
maryland
and
virginia
who
are
but
interested
and
would
be
but
remotely
affected
by
it
the
argument
of
madison
in
the
congress
of
an
extract
from
which
has
been
given
on
a
preceding
page
lays
down
the
same
principle
that
though
any
matter
be
a
local
affair
yet
if
it
involves
national
expense
or
safety
it
becomes
of
concern
to
every
part
of
the
union
and
is
a
proper
subject
for
the
consideration
of
those
charged
with
the
general
administration
of
the
cong
reg
vol
but
these
are
only
the
initiatory
absurdities
of
this
good
faith
the
senators
aptly
illustrate
the
principle
that
error
not
only
conflicts
with
truth
but
is
generally
at
issue
with
itself
for
if
it
would
be
a
violation
of
good
faith
to
maryland
and
virginia
for
congress
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
it
would
be
a
violation
for
congress
to
do
it
the
or
even
at
the
earnest
and
unanimous
petition
of
the
people
of
the
district
yet
for
years
it
has
been
the
southern
doctrine
that
if
the
people
of
the
district
demand
of
congress
relief
in
this
respect
it
has
power
as
their
local
legislature
to
grant
it
and
by
abolishing
slavery
there
carry
out
the
will
of
the
citizens
but
now
new
light
has
broken
in
the
optics
of
the
have
pierced
the
millstone
with
a
deeper
insight
and
discoveries
thicken
faster
than
they
can
be
telegraphed
congress
has
no
power
o
no
not
a
modicum
to
help
the
slaveholders
of
the
district
however
loudly
they
may
clamor
for
it
the
southern
doctrine
that
congress
is
to
the
district
a
mere
local
legislature
to
do
its
pleasure
is
tumbled
from
the
genitive
into
the
vocative
hard
fate
and
that
too
at
the
hands
of
those
who
begat
it
the
reasonings
of
pinckney
wise
and
leigh
are
now
found
to
be
wholly
at
fault
and
the
chanticleer
rhetoric
of
glascock
and
garland
stalks
featherless
and
for
clay
resolution
sweeps
by
the
board
all
those
stereotyped
as
congress
a
local
legislature
consent
of
the
district
bound
to
consult
the
wishes
of
the
district
which
for
the
last
two
sessions
of
congress
have
served
to
eke
out
scanty
supplies
it
declares
that
slavery
existed
in
maryland
and
virginia
at
the
time
of
the
cession
and
as
it
still
continues
in
both
those
states
it
could
not
be
abolished
in
the
district
without
a
violation
of
good
but
let
us
see
where
this
principle
of
the
will
lead
us
if
implied
faith
to
maryland
and
virginia
congress
from
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
district
it
congress
to
do
in
the
district
what
those
states
have
done
within
their
bounds
restrain
from
abolishing
it
upon
the
same
principle
congress
is
by
the
doctrine
of
clay
resolution
to
within
the
district
there
is
no
for
this
plighted
faith
congress
must
not
only
refrain
from
laying
violent
hands
on
slavery
and
see
to
it
that
the
slaveholders
themselves
do
not
but
it
is
bound
to
keep
the
system
up
to
the
maryland
and
virginia
standard
of
vigor
again
if
the
good
faith
of
congress
to
virginia
and
maryland
requires
that
slavery
should
exist
in
the
district
while
it
exists
in
those
states
it
requires
that
it
should
exist
there
it
exists
in
those
states
if
to
abolish
form
of
slavery
in
the
district
would
violate
good
faith
to
abolish
form
existing
in
those
states
and
to
substitute
a
totally
different
one
would
also
violate
it
the
congressional
good
faith
is
to
be
kept
not
only
with
but
with
the
and
virginia
of
slavery
the
faith
of
those
states
not
being
in
the
preservation
of
system
but
of
system
otherwise
congress
instead
of
would
counteract
their
policy
principles
would
be
brought
into
action
there
conflicting
with
their
system
and
thus
the
true
spirit
of
the
implied
pledge
would
be
violated
on
this
principle
so
long
as
slaves
are
chattels
personal
in
virginia
and
maryland
congress
could
not
make
them
inseparable
from
the
soil
as
in
louisiana
nor
could
it
permit
slaves
to
read
nor
to
worship
god
according
to
conscience
nor
could
it
grant
them
trial
by
jury
nor
legalize
marriage
nor
require
the
master
to
give
sufficient
food
and
clothing
nor
prohibit
the
violent
sundering
of
families
because
such
provisions
would
conflict
with
the
existing
slave
laws
of
virginia
and
maryland
and
thus
violate
the
good
faith
implied
so
the
principle
of
the
resolution
binds
congress
in
all
these
particulars
not
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
virginia
and
maryland
abolish
not
to
abolish
any
of
it
that
exists
in
those
states
not
to
abolish
any
or
of
it
still
existing
in
those
states
when
they
do
to
increase
or
abate
its
rigors
and
the
same
are
modified
by
those
states
in
a
word
congressional
action
in
the
district
is
to
float
passively
in
the
wake
of
legislative
action
on
the
subject
in
those
states
but
here
comes
a
dilemma
suppose
the
legislation
of
those
states
should
steer
different
courses
then
there
would
be
wakes
can
congress
float
in
both
yea
verily
nothing
is
too
hard
for
it
its
obsequiousness
equals
its
power
of
legislation
in
cases
whatsoever
it
can
float
on
the
virginia
tide
and
ebb
down
on
the
maryland
at
the
same
time
what
maryland
does
congress
will
do
in
the
maryland
part
what
virginia
does
congress
will
do
in
the
virginia
part
though
congress
might
not
always
be
able
to
run
at
the
bidding
of
both
especially
in
different
directions
yet
if
it
obeyed
orders
cheerfully
and
kept
in
its
place
according
to
its
good
faith
implied
impossibilities
might
not
be
rigidly
exacted
true
we
have
the
highest
sanction
for
the
maxim
that
no
can
serve
two
masters
but
if
corporations
have
souls
analogy
would
absolve
congress
on
that
score
or
at
most
give
it
only
very
small
not
large
enough
to
be
at
all
in
the
way
as
an
to
the
universal
rule
laid
down
in
the
maxim
in
following
out
the
absurdities
of
this
good
faith
it
will
be
seen
at
once
that
the
doctrine
of
clay
resolution
extends
to
the
of
existing
in
maryland
and
virginia
which
exist
also
within
the
district
every
system
institution
law
and
established
usage
there
is
placed
beyond
congressional
control
equally
with
slavery
and
by
the
same
implied
faith
the
abolition
of
the
lottery
system
in
the
district
as
an
was
a
flagrant
breach
of
this
good
faith
to
maryland
and
virginia
as
the
system
still
continued
in
those
states
so
to
abolish
imprisonment
for
debt
and
capital
punishment
to
remodel
the
bank
system
the
power
of
corporations
the
militia
law
laws
of
limitation
in
the
district
virginia
and
maryland
took
the
would
violate
the
good
faith
implied
in
the
cession
that
in
the
acts
of
cession
no
such
good
faith
was
implied
by
virginia
and
maryland
as
is
claimed
in
the
resolution
we
argue
from
the
fact
that
in
virginia
ceded
to
the
united
states
all
her
northwest
territory
with
the
special
proviso
that
her
citizens
inhabiting
that
territory
should
have
their
and
confirmed
to
them
and
be
in
the
enjoyment
of
their
and
liberties
see
journals
of
congress
vol
p
the
cession
was
made
in
the
form
of
a
deed
and
signed
by
thomas
jefferson
samuel
hardy
arthur
lee
and
james
monroe
many
of
these
inhabitants
three
years
after
the
cession
the
virginia
delegation
in
congress
the
passage
of
an
ordinance
which
should
abolish
slavery
in
that
territory
and
declare
that
it
should
never
thereafter
exist
there
all
the
members
of
congress
from
virginia
and
maryland
voted
for
this
ordinance
suppose
some
member
of
congress
had
during
the
passage
of
the
ordinance
introduced
the
following
resolution
resolved
that
when
the
northwest
territory
was
ceded
by
virginia
to
the
united
states
domestic
slavery
existed
in
that
state
including
the
ceded
territory
and
as
it
still
continues
in
that
state
it
could
not
be
abolished
within
the
territory
without
a
violation
of
that
good
faith
which
was
implied
in
the
cession
and
in
the
acceptance
of
the
territory
what
would
have
been
the
indignant
response
of
grayson
griffin
madison
and
the
lees
in
the
congress
of
to
such
a
resolution
and
of
carrington
chairman
of
the
committee
who
reported
the
ratification
of
the
ordinance
in
the
congress
of
and
of
page
and
parker
who
with
every
other
member
of
the
virginia
delegation
supported
it
but
to
enumerate
all
the
absurdities
into
which
the
senators
have
plunged
themselves
would
be
to
make
a
quarto
inventory
we
decline
the
task
and
in
conclusion
merely
add
that
clay
in
presenting
this
resolution
and
each
of
the
senators
who
voted
for
it
entered
on
the
records
of
the
senate
and
proclaimed
to
the
world
a
most
unworthy
accusation
against
the
millions
of
american
citizens
who
have
during
nearly
half
a
century
petitioned
the
national
legislature
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
charging
them
either
with
the
ignorance
or
the
impiety
of
praying
the
nation
to
violate
its
plighted
faith
the
resolution
virtually
indicts
at
the
bar
of
public
opinion
and
brands
with
odium
all
the
manumission
societies
the
petitioners
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
district
and
for
a
long
time
the
only
ones
petitioning
from
year
to
year
through
evil
report
and
good
report
still
petitioning
by
individual
societies
and
in
their
national
conventions
but
as
if
it
were
not
enough
to
table
the
charge
against
such
men
as
benjamin
rush
william
rawle
john
sergeant
robert
vaux
cadwallader

and
peter

itself
headed
by
their
chief
justice
and
judges
even
the
sovereign
states
of
pennsylvania
massachusetts
and
vermont
whose
legislatures
have
either
memorialized
congress
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
or
instructed
their
senators
to
move
such
a
measure
must
be
gravely
informed
by
clay
norvell
niles
smith
pierce
benton
black
tipton
and
other
honorable
senators
either
that
their
perception
is
so
dull
they
know
not
what
of
they
affirm
or
that
their
moral
sense
is
so
blunted
they
can
demand
without
compunction
a
violation
of
the
nation
faith
we
have
spoken
already
of
the
concessions
unwittingly
made
in
this
resolution
to
the
true
doctrine
of
congressional
power
over
the
district
for
that
concession
important
as
it
is
we
have
small
thanks
to
render
that
such
a
resolution
passed
with
such
an
and
pressing
at
a
thousand
points
on
relations
and
interests
vital
to
the
free
states
should
be
hailed
as
it
has
been
by
a
portion
of
the
northern
press
as
a
compromise
originating
in
deference
to
northern
interests
and
to
be
received
by
us
as
a
offering
of
disinterested
benevolence
demanding
our
gratitude
to
the
mover
may
well
cover
us
with
shame
we
deserve
the
humiliation
and
have
well
earned
the
mockery
let
it
come
if
after
having
been
set
up
at
auction
in
the
public
of
the
nation
and
for
thirty
years
and
by
each
of
a
score
of
compromises
treacherously
knocked
off
to
the
lowest
bidder
and
that
without
money
and
without
price
the
north
plundered
and
betrayed
in
this
her
accepted
time
consider
the
things
that
belong
to
her
peace
before
they
are
hidden
from
her
eyes
then
let
her
eat
of
the
fruit
of
her
own
way
and
be
filled
with
her
own
devices
let
the
shorn
and
blinded
giant
grind
in
the
of
the
philistines
till
taught
the
folly
of
intrusting
to
delilahs
the
secret
and
the
custody
of
his
strength
have
the
free
states
bound
themselves
by
an
oath
never
to
profit
by
the
lessons
of
experience
if
lost
to
are
they
dead
to
also
can
nothing
rouse
them
to
cast
about
for
self
preservation
and
shall
a
life
of
tame
surrenders
be
terminated
by
suicidal
sacrifice
a
compromise
bitter
irony
is
the
plucked
and
north
to
be
wheedled
by
the
sorcery
of
another
missouri
compromise
a
compromise
in
which
the
south
gained
all
and
the
north
lost
all
and
lost
it
for
ever
a
compromise
which
embargoed
the
free
laborer
of
the
north
and
west
and
clutched
at
the
staff
he
leaned
upon
to
turn
it
into
a
bludgeon
and
fell
him
with
its
stroke
a
compromise
which
wrested
from
liberty
her
boundless
birthright
domain
stretching
westward
to
the
sunset
while
it
gave
to
slavery
loose
reins
and
a
free
course
from
the
mississippi
to
the
pacific
the
resolution
as
it
finally
passed
is
here
inserted
the
original
resolution
as
moved
by
clay
was
inserted
at
the
head
of
this
postscript
with
the
impression
that
it
was
the
form
it
will
be
seen
however
that
it
underwent
no
material
modification
resolved
that
the
interference
by
the
citizens
of
any
of
the
states
with
the
view
to
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
district
is
endangering
the
rights
and
security
of
the
people
of
the
district
and
that
any
act
or
measure
of
congress
designed
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
would
be
a
violation
of
the
faith
implied
in
the
cessions
by
the
states
of
virginia
and
maryland
a
just
cause
of
alarm
to
the
people
of
the
slaveholding
states
and
have
a
direct
and
inevitable
tendency
to
disturb
