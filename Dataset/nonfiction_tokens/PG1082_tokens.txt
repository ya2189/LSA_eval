voyage
of
the
paper
canoe
by
bishop
a
geographical
journey
of
miles
from
quebec
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
during
the
years
by
nathaniel
bishop
author
of
one
thousand
miles
walk
across
south
america
and
corresponding
member
of
the
boston
society
of
natural
history
and
of

to
the
superintendent
assistants
aids
and
all
employees
of
the
united
states
coast
survey
bureau
the
voyage
of
the
paper
canoe
is
respectfully
dedicated
as
a
slight
evidence
of
the
appreciation
by
its
author
for
their
intelligent
efforts
and
labors
in
the
service
of
their
country
so
patiently
and
skilfully
performing
under
many
difficulties
and
dangers
introduction
the
author
left
quebec
dominion
of
canada
july
with
a
single
assistant
in
a
wooden
canoe
eighteen
feet
in
length
bound
for
the
gulf
of
mexico
it
was
his
intention
to
follow
the
natural
and
artificial
connecting
watercourses
of
the
continent
in
the
most
direct
line
southward
to
the
gulf
coast
of
florida
making
portages
as
seldom
as
possible
to
show
how
few
were
the
interruptions
to
a
continuous
for
vessels
of
light
draught
from
the
chilly
foggy
and
rocky
regions
of
the
gulf
of
lawrence
in
the
north
to
the
waters
of
the
great
southern
sea
the
waves
of
which
beat
upon
the
sandy
shores
of
the
southernmost
united
states
having
proceeded
about
four
hundred
miles
upon
his
voyage
the
author
reached
troy
on
the
hudson
river
new
york
state
where
for
several
years
waters
sons
had
been
perfecting
the
construction
of
paper
boats
the
advantages
in
using
a
boat
of
only
pounds
weight
the
strength
and
durability
of
which
had
been
well
and
satisfactorily
tested
could
not
be
questioned
and
the
author
dismissed
his
assistant
and
paddled
his
own
canoe
about
two
thousand
miles
to
the
end
of
the
journey
though
frequently
lost
in
the
labyrinth
of
creeks
and
marshes
which
skirt
the
southern
coast
of
his
country
the
author
difficulties
were
greatly
lessened
by
the
use
of
the
valuable
and
elaborate
charts
of
the
united
states
coast
survey
bureau
to
the
faithful
executers
of
which
he
desires
to
give
unqualified
and
grateful
praise
to
an
unknown
wanderer
among
the
creeks
rivers
and
sounds
of
the
coast
the
courteous
treatment
of
the
southern
people
was
most
gratifying
the
author
can
only
add
to
this
expression
an
extract
from
his
reply
to
the
address
of
the
mayor
of
mary
georgia
which
city
honored
him
with
an
ovation
and
presentation
of
flags
after
the
completion
of
his
voyage
since
my
little
paper
canoe
entered
southern
waters
upon
her
geographical
errand
from
the
capes
of
the
delaware
to
your
beautiful
mary
i
have
been
deeply
sensible
of
the
value
of
southern
hospitality
the
oystermen
and
fishermen
living
along
the
lonely
beaches
of
the
eastern
shore
of
maryland
and
virginia
the
surfmen
and
lighthouse
keepers
of
albemarle
pamplico
and

who
inhabit
the
uplands
that
skirt
the
network
of

fear
the
people

and

that
jut
into
the
fastnesses
of
the

of
the
crooked
waccamaw
river
the
representatives
of
the
once
powerful
aristocracy
of
the
santee
and
peedee
rivers
the
colored
men
of
the
beautiful
along
the
coast
of
georgia
the
floridians
living
between
the
mary
river
and
the
suwanee
the
wild
river
of
song
the
islanders
on
the
gulf
of
mexico
where
i
terminated
my
long
journey
all
have
contributed
to
make
the
of
the
paper
canoe
a
success
after
returning
from
this
voyage
the
author
embarked
alone
december
in
a
cedar
twelve
feet
in
length
from
the
head
of
the
ohio
river
at
pittsburgh
pennsylvania
and
followed
the
ohio
and
mississippi
rivers
over
two
thousand
miles
to
new
orleans
where
he
made
a
portage
through
that
city
eastwardly
to
lake
pontchartrain
and
rowed
along
the
shores
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
six
or
seven
hundred
miles
to
cedar
keys
florida
the
terminus
of
his
voyage
while
on
these
two
voyages
the
author
rowed
over
five
thousand
miles
meeting
with
but
one
accident
the
overturning
of
his
canoe
in
delaware
bay
he
returned
to
his
home
with
his
boats
in
good
condition
and
his
charts
in
an
excellent
state
of
preservation
at
the
request
of
the
board
on
behalf
of
the

department
of
the

as
the
work
is
based
on
the
results
of
actual
surveys
the
maps
may
be
considered
for
their
size
the
most
complete

the
united

ever
presented

much
credit
is
due

that
their

still
to

is

a
very
narrow
one
known

separates

of
cape
breton
from
nova
scotia
through
this
contracted
thoroughfare
the
tides
run
with
great
force
one
hundred
years
ago
as
the
seaman
approached
the
dangerous
entrance
of
paul
now
brightened
at
night
by
its
his
heart
was
cheered
by
the
sight
of
immense
flocks
of
a
peculiar
now
extinct
when
he
saw
upon
the
water
the
great
auk
alca
impennis
which
he
ignorantly
called
a
pengwin
he
knew
that
land
was
near
at
hand
for
while
he
met
other
species
far
out
upon
the
broad
atlantic
the
great
auk
his
pengwin
kept
near
the
coast
not
only
was
this
now
extinct
bird
his
indicator
of
proximity
to
the
land
but
so
strange
were
its
habits
and
so
innocent
was
its
nature
that
it
permitted
itself
to
be
captured
by
and
thus
were
the
ships
at
little
cost
or
trouble
without
any
a
century
ago
the
great
auk
now
as
a
stuffed
skin
represents
a
value
of
fifteen
hundred
dollars
in
gold
there
are
but
specimens
of
this
bird
in
the
museums
of
europe
and
america
besides
a
few
skeletons
and
of
its
eggs
it
was
called
in
ancient
days
and
was
the
goiful
of
the
icelander
captain
whitbourne
who
wrote
in
the
reign
of
james
the
first
quaintly
said
these
pengwins
are
as
bigge
as
geese
and
flye
not
for
they
have
but
a
little
short
wing
and
they
multiply
so
infinitely
upon
a
certain
flat
island
that
men
drive
them
from
thence
upon
a
board
into
their
boats
by
hundreds
at
a
time
as
if
god
had
made
the
innocency
of
so
poor
a
creature
to
become
such
an
admerable
instrument
for
the
sustenation
of
man
in
a
copy
of
the
english
pilot
fourth
book
published
in
which
i
presented
to
the
library
of
the
united
states
coast
survey
is
found
this
early
description
of
this
now
extinct
american
bird
they
never
go
beyond
the
bank
newfoundland
as
others
do
for
they
are
always
on
it
or
in
it
several
of
them
together
sometimes
more
but
never
less
than
two
together
they
are
large
fowls
about
the
size
a
goose
a
head
and
back
with
a
white
belly
and
a
spot
under
one
of
their
eyes
which
nature
has
ordered
to
be
under
their
right
eye
thus
has
the
greed
of
the
sailor
and
pothunter
swept
from
the
face
of
the
earth
an
old
pilot
a
trusty
aid
to
navigation
now
the
the
and
the
improved
chart
have
taken
the
place
of
the
extinct
auk
as
aids
to
navigation
and
the
sailor
of
sees
the
bright
flashes
of
paul
lights
when
nearly
twenty
miles
at
sea
having
passed
the
little
isle
the
ship
enters
the
great
gulf
of
lawrence
and
passes
the
magdalen
islands
shaping
its
course
as
wind
and
weather
permit
towards
the
dreaded
rocky
coast
of
anticosti
from
the
entrance
of
the
gulf
to
the
island
of
anticosti
the
course
to
be
followed
is
northwesterly
about
one
hundred
and
nautical
miles
the
island
which
divides
an
upper
arm
of
the
gulf
into
two
wide
channels
is
one
hundred
and
miles
long
and
from
ten
to
thirty
miles
wide
across
the
entrance
of
this
great
arm
or
estuary
from
the
high
cape
of
gaspe
on
the
southern
shore
of
the
mainland
to
anticosti
in
the
narrowest
place
is
a
distance
of
about
forty
miles
and
is
called
the
south
channel
from
the
north
side
of
the
island
and
near
its
west
end
to
the
coast
of
labrador
the
north
channel
is
fifteen
miles
wide
the
passage
from
paul
to
anticosti
is
at
times
dangerous
here
is
an
area
of
strong
currents
tempestuous
winds
and
dense
fogs
when
the
wind
is
fair
for
an
upward
run
it
is
the
wind
which
usually
brings
misty
weather
then
from
the
icy
regions
of
the
arctic
circle
from
the
land
of
desolation
come
floating
through
the
straits
of
belle
isle
the
dangerous
bergs
and
early
in
the
spring
these
ice
rafts
are
covered
with
colonies
of
seals
which
resort
to
them
for
the
purpose
of
giving
birth
to
their
young
on
these
icy
cradles
rocked
by
the
restless
waves
tens
of
thousands
of
young
seals
are
nursed
for
a
few
days
then
answering
the
loud
calls
of
their
mothers
they
accompany
them
into
the
briny
deep
there
to
follow
the
promptings
of
their
instincts
the
loud
roarings
of
the
old
seals
on
these
ice
rafts
can
be
heard
in
a
quiet
night
for
several
miles
and
strike
terror
into
the
hearts
of
the
superstitious
sailor
who
is
ignorant
of
the
origin
of
the
tumult
frequently
dense
fogs
cover
the
water
and
while
slowly
moving
along
guided
only
by
the
needle
a
warning
sound
alarms
the
watchful
master
through
the
heavy
mists
comes
the
roar
of
breaking
waters
he
listens
the
dull
swashy
noise
of
waves
meeting
with
resistance
is
now
plainly
heard
the
atmosphere
becomes
suddenly
chilled
it
is
the
breath
of
the
iceberg
then
the
shrill
cry
of
all
hands
on
deck
startles
the
watch
below
from
the
bunks
anxiously
now
does
the
whole
ship
company
lean
upon
the
and
peer
out
into
the
thick
air
with
an
earnestness
born
of
terror
surely
says
the
master
to
his
mate
i
am
past
the
magdalens
and
still
far
from
anticosti
yet
we
have
breakers
which
way
can
we
turn
the
riddle
solves
itself
for
out
of
the
gloom
come
whitened
walls
beautiful
but
terrible
to
behold
those
sailors
watch
the
slowly
moving
berg
as
it
drifts
past
their
vessel
fearing
that
their
own
ship
will
be
drawn
towards
it
from
the
peculiar
power
of
attraction
they
believe
the
iceberg
to
possess
and
as
they
watch
against
the
icy
base
of
the
mountain
in
the
sea
the
waves
beat
and
break
as
if
expending
their
forces
upon
a
rocky
shore
down
the
furrowed
sides
of
the
disintegrating
berg
streamlets
trickle
and
miniature
cascades
leap
mingling
their
waters
with
the
briny
sea
the
intruder
slowly
drifts
out
of
sight
disappearing
in
the
gloom
while
the
sailor
thanks
his
lucky
stars
that
he
has
rid
himself
of
another
danger
the
anticosti
the
graveyard
of
many
seamen
is
yet
to
he
passed
the
ship
skirts
along
its
southern
shore
a
coast
destitute
of
bays
or
harbors
of
any
kind
and
inhospitable
wrecks
of
vessels
strew
the
rocky
shores
and
four
warn
the
mariner
of
danger
once
past
the
island
the
ship
is
well
within
the
estuary
of
the
gulf
into
which
the
lawrence
river
flows
contributing
the
waters
of
the
great
lakes
of
the
continent
to
the
sea
as
the
north
coast
is
approached
the
superstitious
sailor
is
again
alarmed
if
perchance
the
shows
sympathy
with
some
disturbing
element
the
cause
of
which
he
believes
to
exist
in
the
mountains
which
rise
along
the
shore
he
repeats
the
stories
of
ancient
skippers
of
vessels
having
been
lured
out
of
their
course
by
the
deviation
of
the
which
succumbed
to
the
potent
influence
exerted
in
those
hills
of
iron
ore
heeding
not
the
fact
that
the
disturbing
agent
is
the
iron
on
board
of
his
own
ship
and
not
the
magnetic
oxide
of
the
distant
mines
the
ship
being
now
within
the
estuary
of
the
lawrence
river
must
encounter
many
risks
before
she
reaches
the
true
mouth
of
the
river
at
the
bic
islands
the
shores
along
this
arm
of
the
gulf
are
wild
and
sombre
rocky
precipices
frown
upon
the
swift
tidal
current
that
rushes
past
their
bases
a
few
small
settlements
of
fishermen
and
pilots
like
metis
father
point
and
rimousky
are
discovered
at
long
intervals
along
the

in
these
lawrence
hamlets
and
throughout
lower
canada
a
patois
is
spoken
which
is
unintelligible
to
the
londoner
or
parisian
and
these
villagers
the
descendants
of
the
french
colonists
may
be
said
to
be
a
people
destitute
of

they
appropriate
the

in
places
is

call
it
a

offered
me
i
selected
the
southern
leaving
the
other
to
be
traversed
at
some
future
time
to
follow
the
contours
of
rivers
bays
and
sounds
a
voyage
of
at
least
hundred
miles
was
before
me
it
was
my
intention
to
explore
the
connecting
watercourses
southward
without
making
a
single
portage
as
far
as
cape
henlopen
a
sandy
headland
at
the
entrance
of
delaware
bay
there
by
making
short
portages
from
one
watercourse
to
another
to
navigate
along
the
interior
of
the
atlantic
coast
to
the
river
which
is
a
dividing
line
between
georgia
and
florida
from
the
atlantic
coast
of
southern
georgia
i
proposed
to
cross
the
peninsula
of
florida
by
way
of
the
mary
river
to
okefenokee
swamp
thence
by
portage
to
the
suwanee
river
and
by
descending
that
stream
the
boundary
line
of
a
geographical
division
eastern
and
middle
florida
to
reach
the
coast
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
which
was
to
be
the
terminal
point
of
my
canoe
journey
charts
maps
and
men
had
informed
me
that
about
hundred
miles
of
the
trip
could
be
made
upon
waters
but
about
two
hundred
miles
of
voyaging
must
be
done
upon
the
open
atlantic
ocean
as
i
now
write
i
smilingly
remember
how
erroneous
were
my
advisers
for
while
prosecuting
my
voyage
i
was
but
once
upon
the
open
sea
and
then
through
mistake
and
for
only
a
few
minutes
had
i
then
known
that
i
could
have
followed
the
whole
route
in
a
small
boat
upon
strictly
interior
waters
i
should
have
paddled
from
the
basin
of
quebec
in
the
light
paper
canoe
which
i
afterwards
adopted
at
troy
and
which
carried
me
alone
in
safety
two
thousand
miles
to
the
warm
regions
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
the
counsels
of
old
seamen
had
influenced
me
to
adopt
a
large
wooden
decked
canoe
eighteen
feet
long
inches
beam
and
inches
depth
of
hold
which
weighed
with
oars
rudder
mast
and
sail
above
three
hundred
pounds
the
mayeta
was
built
by
an
excellent
workman
lamson
at
bordentown
new
jersey
the
boat
was
sharp
at
each
end
and
the
lines
from
amidships
to
stem
and
from
amidships
to
stempost
were
alike
she
possessed
that
essential
characteristic
of
seaworthiness
abundant
sheer
the
deck
was
pierced
for
a
cockpit
in
the
centre
which
was
six
feet
long
and
surrounded
by
a
high
combing
to
keep
out
water
the
builder
had
done
his
best
to
make
the
mayeta
serve
for
rowing
and
sailing
a
most
difficult
combination
and
one
not
usually
successful
on
the
morning
of
july
i
entered
the
basin
of
quebec
with
my
wooden
canoe
and
my
waterman
one
david
bodfish
a
shoreman
of
new
jersey
after
weeks
of
preparation
and
weary
travel
by
rail
and
by
water
we
had
steamed
up
the
gulf
and
the
river
of
lawrence
to
this
our
most
northern
point
of
departure
we
viewed
the
frowning
heights
upon
which
was
perched
the
city
of
quebec
with
unalloyed
pleasure
and
eagerly
scrambled
up
the
high
banks
to
see
the
interesting
old
city
the
tide
which
rises
at
the
city
piers
eighteen
feet
in
the
spring
during
the
neaps
reaches
only
thirteen
feet
late
in
the
afternoon
the
incoming
tide
promised
to
assist
us
in
ascending
the
river
the
downward
current
of
which
runs
with
velocity
and
with
a
depth
abreast
the
city
of
from
sixteen
to
twenty
fathoms
against
this
current
powerful
steamers
run
one
hundred
and
eighty
miles
up
the
river
to
montreal
in
eighteen
hours
and
descend
in
fourteen
hours
including
two
hours
stoppages
at
sorel
and
three
rivers
at
six
we
pushed
off
into
the
river
which
is
about
of
a
mile
wide
at
this
point
and
commenced
our
voyage
but
fierce
gusts
of
wind
arose
and
drove
us
to
the
shelter
of
hamilton
on
the
opposite
shore
where
we
passed
the
night
sleeping
comfortably
upon
cushions
which
we
spread
on
the
narrow
floor
of
the
boat
sunday
was
to
be
spent
in
camp
but
when
dawn
appeared
we
were
not
allowed
build
a
fire
on
the
lumber
pier
and
were
forced
to
ascend
the
lawrence
in
quest
of
a
retired
spot
above
the
landing
of
croix
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
the
tide
had
been
a
high
one
when
we
beached
our
boat
at
the
foot
of
a
bluff
two
hours
later
the
receding
tide
left
us
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
current
the
river
was
fully
two
miles
wide
at
this
point
and
so
powerful
was
its
current
that
steamers
anchored
in
it
were
obliged
to
keep
their
wheels
slowly
revolving
to
ease
the
strain
on
their
anchors
early
on
monday
morning
we
beheld
with
consternation
that
the
tide
did
not
reach
our
boat
and
by
dint
of
hard
labor
we
constructed
a
railroad
from
a
neighboring
fence
and
moved
the
mayeta
on
rollers
upon
it
over
the
mud
and
the
projecting
reef
of
rocks
some
five
hundred
feet
to
the
water
then
embarking
rowed
close
along
the
shore
to
avoid
the
current
a
deep
fog
settled
down
upon
us
and
we
were
driven
to
camp
again
on
the
left
bank
where
a
cataract
tumbled
over
the
rocks
fifty
or
more
feet
tuesday
was
a
sunny
day
but
the
usual
head
wind
greeted
us
the
water
would
rise
on
the
flood
three
hours
before
the
downward
current
was
checked
in
the
channel
of
the
river
we
could
not
place
any
dependence
in
the
regularity
of
the
tides
as
strong
winds
and
freshets
in
the
tributaries
influence
them
earlier
in
the
season
as
a
writer
remarks
until
the
upland
waters
have
all
run
down
and
the
great
rivers
have
discharged
the
freshets
caused
by
thawing
of
the
snows
in
the
spring
of
the
year
this
current
in
spite
of
tides
will
always
run
down
to
the
uninitiated
the
spectacle
is
a
curious
one
of
the
flood
tide
rising
and
swelling
the
waters
of
a
great
river
some
eight
to
ten
feet
while
the
current
at
the
surface
is
rapidly
descending
the
course
of
the
stream
finding
that
the
wind
usually
rose
and
fell
with
the
sun
we
now
made
it
a
rule
to
anchor
our
boat
during
most
of
the
day
and
pull
against
the
current
at
night
the
moon
and
the
bright
auroral
lights
made
this
task
an
agreeable
one
then
too
we
had
coggia
comet
speeding
through
the
northern
heavens
awakening
many
an
odd
conjecture
in
the
mind
of
my
old
salt
in
this
high
latitude
day
dawned
before
three
and
the
twilight
lingered
so
long
that
we
could
read
the
fine
print
of
a
newspaper
without
effort
at
a
quarter
to
nine
the
lofty
shores
that
surrounded
us
at
quebec
gradually
decreased
in
elevation
and
the
tides
affected
the
river
less
and
less
as
we
approached
three
rivers
where
they
seemed
to
cease
altogether
we
reached
the
great
lumber
station
of
three
rivers
which
is
located
on
the
left
bank
of
the
lawrence
on
friday
evening
and
moved
our
canoe
into
quiet
waters
near
the
entrance
of
lake
of
peter
rain
squalls
kept
us
close
under
our
till
eleven
on
saturday
when
the
wind
being
fair
we
determined
to
make
an
attempt
to
reach
sorel
which
would
afford
us
a
pleasant
for
sunday
lake
of
peter
is
a
shoal
sheet
of
water
miles
long
and
nearly
eight
miles
wide
a
bad
place
to
cross
in
a
small
boat
in
windy
weather
we
set
our
sail
and
sped
merrily
on
but
the
tempest
pressed
us
sorely
compelling
us
to
take
in
our
sail
and
scud
under
bare
poles
until
one
when
we
and
set
the
sail
we
now
flew
over
the
short
and
swashy
seas
as
blast
after
blast
struck
our
little
craft
at
three
the
wind
slackened
permitting
us
to
shake
out
our
reefs
and
crowd
on
all
sail
a
labyrinth
of
islands
closed
the
lake
at
its
western
end
and
we
looked
with
anxiety
to
find
among
them
an
opening
through
which
we
might
pass
into
the
river
lawrence
again
at
five
the
wind
veered
to
the
north
with
squalls
increasing
in
intensity
we
steered
for
a
low
grassy
island
which
seemed
to
separate
us
from
the
river
the
wind
was
not
free
enough
to
permit
us
to
weather
it
so
we
decided
to
beach
the
boat
and
escape
the
furious
tempest
but
when
we
struck
the
marshy
island
we
kept
moving
on
through
the
rushes
that
covered
it
and
fairly
sailed
over
its
submerged
soil
into
the
broad
water
on
the
other
side
bodfish
earnestly
advised
the
propriety
of
anchoring
here
for
the
night
saying
it
is
too
rough
to
go
on
but
the
temptation
held
out
by
the
proximity
to
sorel
determined
me
to
take
the
risk
and
drive
on
again
we
bounded
out
upon
rough
water
with
the
screeching
tempest
upon
us
david
took
the
tiller
while
i
sat
upon
the
to
steady
the
boat
the
mayeta
was
now
to
be
put
to
a
severe
test
she
was
to
cross
seas
that
could
easily
trip
a
boat
of
her
size
but
the
wooden
canoe
was
worthy
of
her
builder
and
flew
like
an
affrighted
bird
over
the
foaming
waves
across
the
broad
water
to
the
shelter
of
a
wooded
half
submerged
island
out
of
which
rose
on
piles
a
little
under
this
lee
we
crept
along
in
safety
the
sail
was
furled
never
to
be
used
in
storm
again
the
wind
went
down
with
the
sinking
sun
and
a
delightful
calm
favored
us
for
our
row
up
the
narrowing
river
eight
miles
to
the
place
of
destination
soon
after
nine
we
came
upon
the
acadian
town
sorel
with
its
bright
lights
cheerily
flashing
out
upon
us
as
we
rowed
past
its
river
front
the
prow
of
our
canoe
was
now
pointed
southward
toward
the
goal
of
our
ambition
the
great
mexican
gulf
and
we
were
about
to
ascend
that
historic
stream
the
lovely
richelieu
upon
whose
gentle
current
two
hundred
and
years
before
champlain
had
ascended
to
the
noble
lake
which
bears
his
name
and
up
which
the
missionary
jogues
had
been
carried
an
unwilling
captive
to
bondage
and
to
torture
we
ascended
the
richelieu
threading
our
way
among
and
rafts
to
a
fringe
of
rushes
growing
out
of
a
shallow
flat
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
just
above
the
town
there
firmly
staking
the
mayeta
upon
her
soft
bed
of
mud
secure
from
danger
we
enjoyed
a
peaceful
rest
through
the
calm
night
which
followed
and
thus
ended
the
rough
passage
of
one
week
duration

at
ten
on
monday
morning
we
resumed
our
journey
up
the
richelieu
the
current
of
which
was
nothing
compared
with
that
of
the
great
river
we
had
left
the
average
width
of
the
stream
was
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
the
grassy
shores
were
made
picturesque
by
groves
of
trees
and
quaintly
constructed
it
was
a
rich
pastoral
land
abounding
in
fine
herds
of
cattle
the
country
reminded
me
of
the
acadian
region
of
grand
pre
which
i
had
visited
during
the
earlier
part
of
the
season
here
as
there
were
delightful
pastoral
scenes
and
rich
verdure
but
here
we
still
had
the
acadian
peasants
while
in
the
land
of
beautiful
evangeline
no
longer
were
they
to
be
found
the
new
englander
now
holds
the
titles
to
those
deserted
old
farms
of
the
scattered
colonists
our
rowing
was
frequently
interrupted
by
heavy
showers
which
drove
us
under
our
for
protection
the
same
large
stone
churches
with
their
unpainted
tin
roofs
glistening
like
silver
in
the
sunlight
marked
out
here
as
on
the
high
banks
of
the
lawrence
river
the
site
of
a
village
twelve
miles
of
rowing
brought
us
to
st
ours
where
we
rested
for
the
night
after
wandering
through
its
shaded
and
quaint
streets
the
village
boys
and
girls
came
down
to
see
us
off
the
next
morning
waving
their
kerchiefs
and
shouting
bon
voyage
two
miles
above
the
town
we
encountered
a
dam
three
feet
high
which
deepened
the
water
on
a
shoal
above
it
we
passed
through
a
single
lock
in
company
with
rafts
of
pine
logs
which
were
on
the
way
to
new
york
to
be
used
for
spars
a
lockage
fee
of
cents
for
our
boat
the
told
us
would
be
collected
at
chambly
basin
it
was
a
pull
of
nearly
six
miles
to
denis
where
the
same
scene
of
comfort
and
plenty
prevailed
women
were
washing
clothes
in
large
iron
pots
at
the
river
edge
and
the
hum
of
the
issued
from
the
doorways
of
the
beehives
in
the
gardens
were
filled
with
honey
and
the
strawthatched
barns
had
their
doors
thrown
wide
open
as
though
waiting
to
receive
the
harvest
at
intervals
along
the
highway
over
the
grassy
hills
tall
white
wooden
crosses
were
erected
for
this
people
like
the
acadians
of
old
are
very
religious
down
the
current
floated
a
curious
boat
which
carries
a
square
sail
and
makes
good
time
only
when
running
before
the
wind
antoine
and
marks
were
passed
and
the
isolated
peak
of
hilaire
loomed
up
grandly
twelve
hundred
feet
on
the
right
bank
of
the
richelieu
opposite
the
town
beloeil
one
mile
above
beloeil
the
grand
trunk
railroad
crosses
the
stream
and
here
we
passed
the
night
strong
winds
and
rain
squalls
interrupted
our
progress
at
chambly
basin
we
tarried
until
the
evening
of
july
before
entering
the
canal
chambly
is
a
for
montreal
people
who
come
here
to
enjoy
the
fishing
which
is
said
to
be
fair
we
had
ascended
one
at
st
ours
here
we
had
eight
steps
to
ascend
within
the
distance
of
one
mile
by
means
of
eight
locks
each
one
hundred
and
ten
feet
long
by
wide
the
mayeta
was
lifted
feet
and
one
inch
in
height
to
the
upper
level
of
the
canal
the
were
courteous
and
wished
us
the
usual
bon
voyage
this
canal
was
built
years
prior
to
my
visit
by
ten
we
had
passed
the
last
lock
and
went
into
camp
in
a
depression
in
the
bank
of
the
canal
the
journey
was
resumed
at
half
past
three
the
following
morning
and
the
row
of
twelve
miles
to
johns
was
a
delightful
one
the
last
lock
the
only
one
at
johns
was
passed
and
we
had
a
full
clearance
at
the
dominion
before
noon
we
were
again
on
the
richelieu
with
about
miles
between
us
and
the
boundary
line
of
the
united
states
and
canada
and
with
very
little
current
to
impede
us
as
dusk
approached
we
passed
a
dismantled
old
fort
situated
upon
an
island
called
ile
aux
noix
and
entered
a
region
inhabited
by
the
large
where
we
camped
for
the
night
amid
the
dolorous
voices
of
these
choristers
on
saturday
the
at
an
early
hour
we
were
pulling
for
the
united
states
which
was
about
six
miles
from
our
the
richelieu
widened
and
we
entered
lake
champlain
passing
fort
montgomery
which
is
about
one
thousand
feet
south
of
the
boundary
line
champlain
has
a
width
of
three
fourths
of
a
mile
at
fort
montgomery
and
at
rouse
point
expands
to
two
miles
and
three
quarters
the
erection
of
the
fort
was
commenced
soon
after
but
in
the
work
was
suspended
as
some
one
discovered
that
the
site
was
in
canada
and
the
cognomen
of
fort
blunder
was
applied
in
the
webster
treaty
of
england
ceded
the
ground
to
the
united
states
and
fort
montgomery
was
finished
at
a
cost
of
over
half
a
million
of
dollars
at
rouse
point
which
lies
on
the
west
shore
of
lake
champlain
about
one
and
miles
south
of
its
confluence
with
the
richelieu
the
mayeta
was
inspected
by
the
united

officer
and
nothing

discovered
the
little
craft
was
permitted
to
continue
her
voyage
at

which
crosses
the

before
proceeding
further
it
may
interest
the
reader
of
practical
mind
to
know
that
a
very
important
movement
is
on
foot
to
facilitate
the

the
question

by
declaring
that
a
patient

mature

we
are
of
opinion
that
the
line
following

probably
no
question
is
of
more
vital
importance
to

the
western

than
the
subject
of
transportation
the
increasing

erie
michigan
huron

served
to
convince
all
commercial
men
that
the
means
of
transit
between
that
country
and
the
seaboard
are
far
too
limited
even
for
the
present
necessities
of
trade
hence
it
becomes
a
question
of
universal
interest
how
the
products
of
the

and
the

can
be
most
cheaply
forwarded
to
the

this

have
been

for
the

which
afford

canada

such
is
the
nature
of
the
navigation
between
on
the
hudson
and

and
the
upper

the
magnitude
of
the
commerce
of
the

has
compelled
the
enlargement
of
the
erie
and
oswego
canals
from
boats
of
to
two
hundred
and
ten
tons
while
the
lawrence
and
welland
canals
have
also
been
enlarged
since
their
first
construction
a
further
enlargement
of
the
erie
and
champlain
canals
is
now
strongly
urged
in
consequence
of
the
want
of
the
necessary
facilities
of
transport
for
the
ever
increasing
western
trade
the
object
of
the
caughnawaga
is
to
connect
lake
champlain
with
the
lawrence
by
the
least
possible
distance
and
with
the
smallest
amount
of
lockage
when
built
it
will
enable
the
vessel
or
propeller
to
sail
from
the
head
of
lakes
superior
or
michigan
without
breaking
bulk
and
will
enable
such
vessels
to
land
and
receive
cargo
at
burlington
and
whitehall
from
whence
western
freights
can
be
carried
to
and
from
boston
and
throughout
new
england
by
railway
cheaper
than
by
any
other
route
it
will
possess
the
advantage
when
the
welland
canal
is
enlarged
and
the
locks
of
the
lawrence
canal
lengthened
of
passing
vessels
of
eight
hundred
and
fifty
tons
burden
and
with
that
size
of
vessel
impossible
on
any
other
route
of
improved
model
with
facilities
for
loading
and
discharging
cargoes
at
both
ends
of
the
route
in
the
length
of
the
voyage
without
transshipment
in
having
the
least
distance
between
any
of
the
lake
ports
and
a
seaport
and
in
having
the
shortest
length
of
taxed
canal
navigation
the
construction
of
the
caughnawaga
canal
when
carried
out
will
remedy
the
difficulties
which
now
exist
and
stand
in
the
way
of
an
uninterrupted
water
communication
between
the
western
states
and
the
atlantic
seaboard
from
rouse

we
proceeded
to
a
picturesque
point
which
jutted
into
the

below
chazy
landing
and
was
sheltered
by
a
grove
of
trees
into
which
we
hauled
the

to
construct
a
wigwam
out
of

where
we
quietly
resided
until

the
owner
of

trombly
invited
us
to

which
he
had
made
from

in
his

of
the

work
he
eloquently
says
the
adirondack
wilderness
may
be
considered
the
wonder
and
the
glory
of
new
york
it
is
a
vast
natural
park
one
immense
and
silent
forest
curiously
and
beautifully
broken
by
the
gleaming
waters
of
a
myriad
of
lakes
between
which
rugged
rise
as
a
sea
of
granite
billows
at
the
northeast

mountains
culminate
within
an
area
of
some
hundreds
of
square

rocky
crests
amid

frosty
clouds
the
wild
beasts
may
look
forth
from
the
ledges
on
the
over
unbroken
woodlands
stretching
beyond
the
reach
of
sight
beyond
the
blue
hazy
ridges
at
the
horizon
the
voyager
by
the
canoe
beholds
lakes
in
which
these
mountains
and
wild
forests
are
reflected
like
inverted
reality
now
wondrous
in
their
dark
grandeur
and
solemnity
now
glorious
in
resplendent
autumn
color
of
pearly
beauty
here
thrilling
sound
to

echoes
the
wild
melody
of
the
hound
awakening
the
solitude
with

as
he
pursues
the
swift
career
of
deer
the
quavering
note
of
the
loon
on
the
lake
the
mournful
hoot
of
the
owl
at
night
with
rarer
forest
voices
have
also
to
the
lover
of
nature
their
peculiar
charm
and
form
the
wild
language
of
this
forest
it
is
this
region
of
lakes
and
mountains
whose
mountain
core
is
well
shown
by
the
illustration
heart
of
the
adirondacks
that
our
citizens
desire
to
reserve
forever
as
a
public
forest
park
not
only
as
a
resort
of
rest
for
themselves
and
for
posterity
but
for
weighty
reasons
of
political
economy
for
reservoirs
of
water
for
the
canals
and
rivers
for
the
amelioration
of
spring
floods
by
the
preservation
of
the
forests
sheltering
the
deep
winter
snows
for
the
salvation
of
the
timber
our
only
cheap
source
of
lumber
supply
should
the
canadian
and
western
markets
be
ruined
by
fires
or
otherwise
lost
to
us
its
preservation
as
a
state
forest
is
urgently
demanded
to
the
number
of
those
chilly
peaks
amid
which
our
principal
rivers
take
their
rise
i
have
added
by
measurement
a
dozen
or
more
over
four
thousand
feet
in
height
which
were
before
either
nameless
or
only
vaguely
known
by
the
names
given
them
by
hunters
and
trappers
it
is
well
to
note
that
the
final
hypsometrical
computations
fully
affirm
my
discovery
that
in
mount
haystack
we
have
another
mountain
of
five
thousand
feet
altitude
it
may
not
be
uninteresting
also
to
remark
that
the
difference
between
the
altitudes
of
mount
marcy
and
mount
washington
of
the
white
mountains
of
new
hampshire
is
found
to
be
quite
eight
hundred
feet
mount
marcy
mount
macintyre
and
mount
haystack
are
to
be
remembered
as
the
three
royal
summits
of

if
the
general
reader
will
pardon
a
seeming
digression
to
gratify
the
curiosity
of
some
of
my
boating
friends
i
will
give
from
the
report
of
the
adirondack
survey
colvin
account
of
his
singular
boat
one
of
the
lightest
yet
constructed
and
weighing
only
as
much
as
a
hunter
gun
colvin
says
i
also
had
constructed
a
canvas
boat
of
my
own
invention
for
use
in
the
interior
of
the
wilderness
on
such
of
the
mountain
lakes
as
were
inaccessible
to
boats
and
which
it
would
be
necessary
to
map
this
boat
was
peculiar
no
more
frame
being
needed
than
could
be
readily
cut
in
thirty
minutes
in
the
first
thicket
it
was
twelve
feet
long
with
thin
sheet
brass
prows
riveted
on
and
so
fitted
as
to
receive
the
keelson
prow
pieces
and
ribs
of
boughs
when
required
the
canoe
being
made
with
pure
rubber
gum
dissolved
in
naphtha
rubbed
into
it
page
of
colvin
report
informs
the
reader
how
well
this
novel
craft
served
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
built
september
was
devoted
to
levelling
and
topographical
work
at
ampersand
pond
a
solitary
lake
locked
in
by
mountains
and
seldom
visited
there
was
no
boat
upon
its
surface
and
in
order
to
complete
the
hydrographical
work
we
had
now
of
necessity
to
try
my
portable
canvas
boat
which
had
hitherto
done
service
as
bed
or
tent
cutting
green
rods
for
ribs
we
unrolled
the
boat
and
tied
them
in
lashing
poles
for
gunwales
at
the
sides
and
in
a
short
time
our
canvas
canoe
buoyant
as
a
cork
was
floating
on
the
water
the
guides
who
had
been
unable
to
believe
that
the
flimsy
bag
they
carried
could
be
used
as
a
boat
were
in
ecstasies
rude
but
efficient
paddles
were
hastily
hewn
from
the
nearest
tree
and
soon
we
were
all
gliding
in
our
boat
over
the
waves
of
ampersand
which
glittered
in
the
morning
sunlight
to
the
guides
the
boat
was
something
astonishing
they
could
not
refrain
from
laughter
to
find
that
they
were
really
afloat
in
it
and
pointed
with
surprise
at
the
waves
which
could
be
seen
through
the
boat
rippling
against
its
sides
with
the
aid
of
the
boat
with
prismatic
compass
and
sextant
i
was
able
to
secure
an
excellent
map
of
the
lake
and
we
almost
succeeded
in
catching
a
deer
which
was
driven
into
the
lake
by
a
strange
hound
the
dog
lost
the
trail
at
the
water
and
desiring
to
put
him
on
the
track
we
paddled
to
him
he
scrambled
into
the
boat
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
as
if
he
had
always
travelled
in
just
such
a
thing
soon
we
had
regained
the
trail
and
making
the
mountains
echo
to
his
voice
he
again
pursued
the
deer
on
into
the
trackless
forest
continuing
our
work
we
passed
down
into
the
outlet
where
in
trying
to
effect
a
landing
we
suddenly
came
face
to
face
with
a
large
panther
which
had
evidently
been
watching
us
he
fled
at
our
approach
our
baggage
was
quickly
packed
and
the
temporary
frame
of
the
canoe
having
been
taken
out
and
thrown
away
we
rolled
up
our
boat
and
put
it
in
the
bottom
of
a
the
same
day
by
noon
we
reached
cold
brook
again
here
navigable
in
an
hour
and
a
half
we
had
the
canvas
cut
out
two
paddles
from
a
dry

dinner
loaded
the
boat
and
were
off
easily
gliding
down
stream
to
the
saranac
river
three
men
the
heaped
baggage
in
the
centre
and
the
solemn
hound
who
seemed
to
consider
himself
part
of
the
company
sitting
upright
near
the
prow
forming
in
all
a
burden
of
about
one
third
of
a
ton
was
a
severe
test
of
the
green
boughs
of
which
we
had
made
the
frame
ascending
the
saranac
river
we
struck
out
into
the
broad
saranac
lake
some
six
miles
in
length
and
though
the
winds
and
the
waves
buffeted
us
the
canvas
sides
of
the
boat
responding
elastically
to
each
beat
of
the
waves
we
got
safely
along

near
the
sister
islands
when
the
wind
blowing
very
fresh
the
rollers
began
to
pitch
into
the

us

where
the

hudson
river
canal
forms
a

this
long
termination
of

gave
to
the

the
fancy
of
calling
it
tisinondrosa

in

inexperienced
with

from

good
authority
the
appellation
of

narrow
terminal
water
of
the
southern
end
of
lake
champlain
the
tail
of
the
lake
another
authority
in
describing
lake
george
says
the
indians
named
the
lake
on
account
of
the
purity
of
its
waters
horicon
or
water
they
also
called
it
or
tail
of
the
lake
on
account
of
its
connecting
with
lake
champlain
cooper
in
his
last
of
the
mohicans
says
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
french
name
of
the
lake
was
too
complicated
the
american
too
commonplace
and
the
indian
too
unpronounceable
for
either
to
be
used
familiarly
in
a
work
of
fiction
so
he
called
it
horicon
history
furnishes
us
with
the
following
facts
in
regard
to
the
discovery
of
the
lake
while
journeying
up
the
lawrence
in
a
fleet
of
twelve
canoes
on
a
mission
to
the
friendly
huron
aborigines
father
isaac
jogues
and
his
two
friends
donnes
of
the
mission
rene
goupil
and
guillaume
couture
with
another
frenchman
were
captured
at
the
western
end
of
lake
of
peter
by
a
band
of
iroquois
which
was
on
a
marauding
expedition
from
the
mohawk
river
country
near
what
is
now
the
city
of
troy
in
the
panic
caused
by
the
sudden
onslaught
of
the
iroquois
the
unconverted
portion
of
the
huron
allies
of
the
frenchmen
fled
into
the
woods
while
the
christianized
portion
defended
the
white
men
for
a
while
a
reinforcement
of
the
enemy
soon
scattered
these
also
but
not
until
the
frenchmen
and
a
few
of
the
hurons
were
made
captive
this
was
on
the
of
august
according
to
francis
parkman
the
author
of
the
jesuits
in
north
america
the
savages
tortured
jogues
and
his
white
companions
striping
off
their
clothing
tearing
out
their
fingernails
with
their
teeth
and
gnawing
their
fingers
with
the
fury
of
beasts
the
seventy
iroquois
returned
southward
following
the
river
richelieu
lake
champlain
and
lake
george
en
route
for
the
mohawk
towns
meeting
a
war
party
of
two
hundred
of
their
own
nation
on
one
of
the
islands
of
champlain
the
indians
formed
two
parallel
lines
between
which
the
captives
were
forced
to
run
for
their
lives
while
the
savages
struck
at
them
with
thorny
sticks
and
clubs
father
jogues
fell
exhausted
to
the
ground
bathed
in
his
own
blood
when
fire
was
applied
to
his
body
at
night
the
young
warriors
tormented
the
poor
captives
by
opening
their
wounds
and
tearing
out
their
hair
and
beards
the
day
following
this
night
of
torture
the
indians
and
their
mangled
captives
reached
the
promontory
of
ticonderoga
along
the
base
of
which
flowed
the
limpid
waters
the
outlet
of
lake
george
here
the
party
made
a
portage
through
the
primeval
forests
carrying
their
canoes
and
cargoes
on
their
backs
when
suddenly
there
broke
upon
their
view
the
dark
blue
waters
of
a
beautiful
lake
which
parkman
thus
eloquently
describes
like
a
fair
naiad
of
the
wilderness
it
slumbered
between
the
guardian
mountains
that
breathe
from
crag
and
forest
the
stern
poetry
of
war
but
all
then
was
solitude
and
the
clang
of
trumpets
the
roar
of
cannon
and
the
deadly
crack
of
the
rifle
had
never
as
yet
awakened
their
angry
echoes
again
the
canoes
were
launched
and
the
wild
flotilla
glided
on
its
way
now
in
the
shadow
of
the
heights
now
on
the
broad
expanse
now
among
the
devious
channels
of
the
narrows
beset
with
woody
islets
where
the
hot
air
was
redolent
of
the
pine
the
spruce
and
the
cedar
till
they
neared
that
tragic
shore
where
in
the
following
century
new
england
rustics
battled
the
soldiers
of
dieskau
where
montcalm
planted
his
batteries
where
the
red
cross
waved
so
long
amid
the
smoke
and
where
at
length
the
summer
night
was
hideous
with
carnage
and
an
honored
name
was
stained
with
a
memory
of
blood
the
indians
landed
at
or
near
the
future
site
of
fort
william
henry
left
their
canoes
and
with
their
prisoners
began
their
march
for
the
nearest
mohawk
town
father
jogues
lived
among
his
captors
until
the
fall
of
when
he
escaped
in
a
vessel
from
the
dutch
settlement
of
rensselaerswyck
albany
to
which
place
the
iroquois
had
gone
to
trade
with
the
inhabitants
he
arrived
at
the
jesuit
college
of
rennes
france
in
a
most
destitute
condition
on
the
of
january
where
he
was
joyfully
received
and
kindly
cared
for
when
he
appeared
before
queen
anne
of
austria
the
woman
who
wore
a
diadem
thought
it
a
privilege
to
kiss
his
mutilated
hands
in
the
roman
catholic
church
a
deformed
or
mutilated
priest
can
not
say
mass
he
must
be
a
perfect
man
in
body
and
mind
before
the
lord
father
jogues
wished
to
return
to
his
old
missionary
field
so
to
restore
to
him
his
lost
right
of
saying
mass
the
pope
granted
his
prayer
by
a
special
dispensation
in
the
spring
of
he
returned
to
the
lawrence
country
to
found
a
new
mission
to
be
called
the
mission
of
martyrs
his
superior
at
montreal
ordered
him
to
proceed
to
the
country
of
the
mohawks
and
in
company
with
sieur
bourdon
a
government
engineer
and
six
indians
he
followed
the
richelieu
and
champlain
which
the
savages
called
the
doorway
of
the
country
until
the
little
party
stood
on
the
northern
end
of
lake
george
on
the
evening
of
corpus
christi
and
with
the
catholic
spirit
of
the
jesuit
missionary
he
christened
it
lac
sacrement
and
this
name
it
bore
for
a
whole
century
on
the
of
october
the
tomahawk
of
the
savage
ended
the
life
of
father
jogues
who
after
suffering
many
tortures
and
indignities
from
his
iroquois
captors
died
in
their
midst
while
working
for
their
salvation
in
his
field
of
christian
labor
the
right
of
a
discoverer
to
name
new
lakes
and
rivers
is
old
and
unquestioned
a
missionary
of
the
cross
penetrated
an
unexplored
wilderness
and
found
this
noblest
gem
of
the
lower
adirondacks
unknown
to
civilized
man
impressed
with
this
sublime
work
of
his
creator
the
martyred
priest
christened
it
sacrement
one
hundred
years
later
came
troops
of
soldiers
with
mouths
filled
with
strange
oaths
cursing
their
enemies
what
respect
had
they
for
the
rights
of
discoverers
or
martyred
missionaries
so
general
johnson
an
ambitious
irishman
discarded
the
christian
name
of
the
lake
and
replaced
it
with
the
english
one
of
george
he
did
not
name
it
after
george
the
patron
saint
of
england
of
whom
history
asserts
that
he
was
identical
with
a
native
of
either
cappadocia
or
cilicia
who
raised
himself
by
flattery
of
the
great
from
the
meanest
circumstances
to
be
purveyor
of
bacon
for
the
army
and
who
was
put
to
death
with
two
of
his
ministers
by
a
mob
for
peculations
but
he
took
that
of
a
sensual
king
george
of
england
in
order
to
advance
his
own
interests
with
that
monarch
for
more
than
a
century
lake
george
was
the
highway
between
canada
and
the
hudson
river
its
pure
waters
were
so
much
esteemed
as
to
be
taken
regularly
to
canada
to
be
consecrated
and
used
in
the
roman
catholic
churches
in
baptismal
and
other
sacred
rites
the
lake
was
frequently
occupied
by
armies
and
the
forts
george
and
william
henry
at
the
southern
end
possess
most
interesting
historical
associations
the
novelist
cooper
made
lake
george
a
region
of
romance
to
the
young
generation
of
americans
who
yearly
visit
its
shores
it
is
an
el
dorado
and
the
very
air
breathes
love
as
they
glide
in
their
light
boats
over
its
pellucid
waters
adding
to
the
picturesqueness
of
the
scene
and
supplying
that
need
ever
felt
no
matter
what
the
natural
beauty
the
presence
of
man
i
believe
even
the
garden
of
eden
itself
could
not
have
been
perfect
till
among
its
shady
groves
fell
the
shadows
of
our
first
parents
the
cool
retreats
the
jutting
promontories
the
rocks
against
which
the
waves
softly
break
if
these
had
tongues
they
would
like
tennyson
brook
go
on
forever
for
surely
they
would
never
have
done
telling
the
tender
tales
they
have
heard
nor
would
it
be
possible
to
find
a
more
fitting
spot
for
the
cultivation
of
love
and
sentiment
than
this
charming
lake
affords
for
nature
seems
to
have
created
lake
george
in
one
of
her
happiest
moments
this
lake
is
about
miles
long
and
varies
in
width
from
one
to
four
miles
its
greatest
depth
is
about
the
same
as
that
of
champlain
it
possesses
like
all
the
american
lakes
when
used
as
fashionable
the
usual
three
hundred
and
islands
when
i
left
the
mayeta
i
followed
a
narrow
footpath
to
a
rough
mountain
road
which
in
turn
led
me
through
the
forests
towards
lake
george
in
an
isolated
dell
i
found
the
home
of
one
levi
smith
who
piloted
me
through
the
woods
to
the
lake
and
ferried
me
in
a
skiff
across
to
hague
when
i
dined
at
the
hotel
and
resumed
my
journey
along
the
shores
to
sabbath
day
point
where
at
four
a
steamer
on
its
trip
from
ticonderoga
to
the
south
end
of
the
lake
stopped
and
took
me
on
board
we
steamed
southward
to
where
high
mountains
shut
in
the
lake
and
for
several
miles
threaded
the
narrows
with
its
many
pretty
islands
upon
one
of
which
henry
hill
the
had
erected
his
modest
home
and
where
he
toiled
at
his
studies
early
and
late
summer
and
winter
three
goats
and
a
squirrel
were
his
only
companions
in
this
lonely
but
romantic
spot
during
one
cold
winter
when
the
lake
was
frozen
over
to
a
depth
of
two
feet
and
the
forests
were
mantled
in
snow
hill
brother
a
civil
engineer
made
a
visit
to
this
icy
region
and
the
two
brothers
surveyed
the
narrows
making
a
correct
map
of
that
portion
of
the
lake
with
all
its
islands
carefully
located
hill
afterwards
made
an
etching
of
this
map
surrounding
it
with
an
artistic
border
representing
objects
of
interest
in
the
locality
late
in
the
afternoon
the
steamer
landed
me
at
crosbyside
on
the
east
shore
about
a
mile
from
the
head
of
the
lake
resting
beneath
the
shady
groves
of
which
i
beheld
one
of
the
most
charming
views
of
lake
george
early
the
following
morning
i
took
up
my
abode
with
a
farmer
one
william
lockhart
a
genial
and
eccentric
gentleman
and
a
descendant
of
sir
walter
scott
lockhart
little
cottage
is
half
a
mile
north
of
crosbyside
and
near
the
high
bluff
which
charles
the
distinguished
lawyer
of
new
york
city
presented
to
the
paulist
fathers
whose
establishment
is
on
street
in
that
metropolis
here
the
members
of
the
new
order
come
to
pass
their
summer
vacations
bringing
with
them
their
theological
students
the
paulists
are
hard
workers
visiting
and
holding
missions
in
minnesota
california
and
other
parts
of
the
united
states
they
seem
to
feel
forcibly
the
truth
expressed
in
these
lines
which
are
to
be
found
in
aspirations
of
nature
a
work
written
by
the
founder
of
their
order
father
hecker
existence
is
not
a
dream
but
a
solemn
reality
life
was
not
given
to
be
thrown
away
on
miserable
sophisms
but
to
be
employed
in
earnest
search
after
truth
lockhart
kindly
offered
to
escort
me
to
the
convent
of
mary
on
the
lake
and
after
following
the
mountain
road
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
the
north
of
the
cottage
of
my
companion
we
entered
the
shady
grounds
of
the
convent
and
were
kindly
received
on
the
long
piazza
by
the
father
superior
rev
hewit
who
introduced
me
to
several
of
his
a
party
of
them
having
just
returned
from
an
excursion
to
the
harbor
islands
at
the
northern
end
of
the
narrows
which
property
is
owned
by
the
order
i
was
told
that
the
members
of
this
new
religious
establishment
numbered
about
thirty
and
that
all
but
four
were
converts
from
our
protestant
faith
their
property
in
new
york
city
is
probably
worth
half
a
million
of
dollars
and
the
sunday
schools
under
their
charge
contain
about
fifteen
hundred
scholars
here
among
others
i
saw
father
who
gave
up
his
distinguished
position
as
instructor
of
the
art
of
war
at
the
military
academy
of
west
point
to
become
a
soldier
of
the
cross
preferring
to
serve
his
master
by
preaching
the
gospel
of
peace
to
mankind
under
an
overhanging
rock
at
a
little
distance
were
conversing
most
happily
two
young
priests
who
a
few
years
before
had
fought
on
opposite
sides
during
the
civil
strife
which
resulted
in
the
preservation
of
the
great
republic
a
mathematician
and
astronomer
from
the
cambridge
and
also
from
a
government
observatory
who
had
donned
the
cassock
gave
me
much
valuable
information
in
regard
to
the
mountain
peaks
of
lake
george
which
he
had
carefully
studied
and
accurately
measured
through
his
courtesy
and
generosity
i
am
enabled
to
give
on
the
preceding
page
the
results
of
his

or

the
interesting
conversation
was
here
interrupted
by
the
tolling
of
the
convent
bell
a
deep
silence
prevailed
as
with
uncovered
heads
and
upon
bended
knees
the
whole
company
most
devoutly
crossed
themselves
while
repeating
a
prayer
i
felt
much
drawn
towards
a
young
priest
with
delicate
and
refined
features
who
now
engaged
me
in
conversation
he
was
an
adept
in
all
that
related
to
boats
he
loved
the
beautiful
lake
and
was
never
happier
than
when
upon
its
mirrored
surface
except
when
laboring
at
his
duties
among
the
poor
of
the
ninth
district
of
new
york
the
son
of
a
distinguished
general
he
inherited
rare
talents
which
were
placed
at
his
saviour
service
his
christianity
was
so
liberal
his
aspirations
so
noble
his
sympathies
so
strong
that
i
became
much
interested
in
him
and
when
i
left
the
lake
shortly
after
he
quietly
said
when
you
return
next
summer
to
build
your
cottage
let
me
help
you
plan
the
but
when
i
returned
to
the
shores
of
lake
george
after
the
completion
of
my
voyage
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
no
helping
hand
was
there
and
i
built
my
unassisted
for
the
gentle
spirit
of
the
missionary
paulist
had
gone
to
god
who
gave
it
and
father
rosencranz
was
receiving
his
reward
when
i
joined
my
travelling
companion
david
bodfish
he
grievously
inveighed
against
the
community
of
whitehall
because
some
dishonest
boatmen
from
the
canal
had
appropriated
the
stock
of
pipes
and
tobacco
he
had
laid
in
for
his
three
or
four
days
voyage
to
albany
sixty
cents
worth
of
new
pipes
and
tobacco
said
david
in
injured
tones
is
a
great
loss
and
a
bodfish
never
was
worth
anything
at
work
without
his
tobacco
i
used
to
pour
speerits
down
to
keep
my
speerits
up
but
of
late
years
i
have
depended
on
tobacco
as
the
speerits
one
gets
nowadays
is
the
same
kind
we
got
when
i
was
a
boy
and
worked
in
old
hawkin
swamp
canal
voyaging
after
one
has
experienced
the
sweet
influences
of
lakes
george
and
champlain
is
indeed
monotonous
but
to
follow
connecting
watercourses
it
was
necessary
for
the
mayeta
to
traverse
the
champlain
canal
and
the
erie
canal
six
miles
from
whitehall
to
albany
on
the
hudson
river
a
total
distance
of
seventy
miles
there
was
nothing
of
sufficient
interest
in
the
passage
of
the
canal
to
be
worthy
of
record
save
the
giving
way
of
a
near
troy
and
the
precipitating
of
a
into
the
vortex
of
waters
that
followed
by
this
accident
my
boat
was
detained
one
day
on
the
banks
of
the
canal
on
the
fourth
day
the
mayeta
ended
her
services
by
arriving
at
albany
where
after
a
journey
of
four
hundred
miles
experience
had
taught
me
that
i
could
travel
more
quickly
in
a
lighter
boat
and
more
conveniently
and
economically
without
a
companion
it
was
now
about
the
first
week
in
august
and
the
delay
which
would
attend
the
building
of
a
new
boat
especially
adapted
for
the
journey
of
two
thousand
miles
yet
to
be
travelled
would
not
be
lost
as
by
waiting
a
few
weeks
time
would
be
given
for
the
malaria
on
the
rivers
of
new
jersey
delaware
and
maryland
and
even
farther
south
to
be
eradicated
by
the
fall
frosts
david
returned
to
his
new
jersey
home
a
happy
man
invested
with
the
importance
which
attaches
itself
to
a
great
traveller
i
had
unfortunately
contributed
to
bodfish
thirst
for
the
marvellous
by
reading
to
him
at
night
in
our
lonely
camp
jules
verne
imaginative
journey
to
the
centre
of
the
earth
david
was
in
ecstasies
over
this
wonderful
contribution
to
fiction
he
preferred
fiction
to
truth
at
any
time
once
while
reading
to
him
a
chapter
of
the
above
work
his
credulity
was
so
challenged
that
he
became
excited
and
broke
forth
with
say
boss
how
do
these
big
larn
to
lie
so
well
does
it
come
to
them
or
is
it
got
by
edication
i
have
since
heard
that
when
bodfish
arrived
in
the
regions
of
new
jersey
he
related
to
his
friends
his
adventures
in
furrin
parts
as
he
styled
the
dominion
of
canada
and
so
interlaced
the
facts
of
the
cruise
of
the
mayeta
with
the
fancies
of
the
journey
to
the
centre
of
the
earth
that
to
his
neighbors
the
region
of
the
lawrence
has
become
a
country
of
awful
and
mysterious
associations
while
the
more
knowing
members
of
the
community
which
david
honors
with
his
presence
are
firmly
convinced
that
there
never
existed
such
a
boat
as
the
mayeta
save
in
the
wild
imagination
of
david
bodfish
bodfish
fictitious
adventures
as
related
by
him
covered
many
thousand
miles
of
canoe
voyaging
he
had
penetrated
the
region
of
ice
beyond
labrador
and
had
viewed
with
complacency
the
north
pole
which
he
found
to
be
a
spar
that
had
been
erected
by
the
coast
survey
to
measure
pints
from
he
roundly
censured
the
crews
of
which
had
mutilated
this
noble
government
work
by
splitting
much
of
it
into
fortunately
about
of
audience

no
very
clear
conceptions
of
the
character
of
the
north
pole
some
of
them
having
ignored
its
very
existence
so
they
accepted
this
portion
of
his
narrative
while
they
rejected
the
most
reasonable
part
of
his
story
the

sent
to

the

boat
is
without
a
rival
when
used
in
its
own
peculiar
sphere
the
improved
paper
boat
will
be
found
to
possess
the
following
merits
less
weight
greater
strength
stiffness
durability
and
speed
than
a
wooden
boat
of
the
same
size
and
model
and
the
moulded
paper
shell
will
retain
the
delicate
lines
so
essential
to
speed
while
the
brittle
wooden
shell
yields
more
or
less
to
the
warping
influences
of
sun
and
moisture
a
comparison
of
the
strength
of
wood
and
paper
for
boats
has
been
made
by
a
writer
in
the
cornell
times
a
journal
published
by
the
students
of
that
celebrated
new
york
college
let
us
take
a
piece
of
wood
and
a
piece
of
paper
of
the
same
thickness
and
experiment
with
use
and
abuse
them
both
to
the
same
extent
let
the
wood
be
of
of
an
inch
in
thickness
the
usual
thickness
of
and
the
paper
heavy
pasteboard
both
one
foot
square
holding
them
up
by
one
side
strike
them
with
a
hammer
and
observe
the
result
the
wood
will
be
cracked
to
say
the
least
the
pasteboard
whirled
out
of
your
hand
will
only
be
dented
at
most
take
hold
and
bend
them
the
wood
bends
to
a
certain
degree
and
then
splits
the
pasteboard
bent
to
the
same
degree
is
not
affected
in
the
least
take
a
knife
and
strike
them
the
wood
is
again
split
the
pasteboard
only
pierced
place
them
on
the
water
the
wood
floats
for
an
indefinite
time
the
pasteboard
after
a
time
soaks
and
finally
sinks
as
was
to
be
expected
but
suppose
we
soak
the
pasteboard
in
marine
glue
before
the
experiment
then
we
find
the
pasteboard
equally
as
impervious
to
the
water
as
wood
and
as
buoyant
if
of
the
same
weight
but
to
be
of
the
same
weight
it
must
be
thinner
than
the
wood
yet
even
then
it
stands
the
tests
as
well
as
when
thicker
and
it
will
be
found
to
stand
all
tests
much
better
than
wood
even
when
it
weighs
considerably
less
now
enlarging
our
pieces
and
moulding
them
into
boats
of
the
same
weight
we
find
the
following
differences
wood
being
stiff
and
liable
to
split
can
only
be
moulded
into
comparative
form
paper
since
it
can
be
rendered
perfectly
pliable
can
be
pressed
into
any
shape
desirable
hence
any
fineness
of
lines
can
be
given
to
the
model
and
the
paper
will
assume
the
identical
shape
after
which
it
can
be
hardened
and
polished
paper
neither
swells
nor
shrinks
nor
cracks
hence
it
does
not
leak
is
always
ready
for
use
always
serviceable
as
to
cost
there
is
very
little
difference
between
the
two
the
cost
being
within
dollars
more
or
less
the
same
for
both
those
who
use
paper
boats
think
them
very
near
perfection
and
surely
those
who
have
the
most
to
do
with
boats
ought
to
know
prejudice
aside
which
is
the
best
an
injury
to
a
paper
boat
is
easily
repaired
by
a
patch
of
strong
paper
and
a
coating
of
shellac
put
on
with
a
hot
iron
as
the
paper
boat
is
a
novelty
with
many
people
a
sketch
of
its
early
history
may
prove
interesting
to
the
reader
george
a
waters
the
son
of
the
senior
member
of
the
firm
of
waters
sons
of
troy
new
york
was
invited
some
years
since
to
a
masquerade
party
the
boy
repaired
to
a
toy
shop
to
purchase
a
counterfeit
face
but
thinking
the
price
eight
dollars
was
more
than
he
could
afford
for
a
single
evening
sport
he
borrowed
the
mask
for
a
model
from
which
he
produced
a
duplicate
as
perfect
as
was
the
original
while
engaged
upon
his
novel
work
an
idea
impressed
itself
upon
his
ingenious
brain
can
not
he
queried
a
paper
shell
be
made
upon
the
wooden
model
of
a
boat
and
will
not
a
shell
thus
produced
after
being
treated
to
a
coat
of
varnish
float
as
well
and
be
lighter
than
a
wooden
boat
this
was
in
march
while
the
youth
was
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
paper
boxes
having
repaired
a
wooden
by
covering
the
cracks
with
sheets
of
stout
paper
cemented
to
the
wood
the
result
satisfied
him
and
he
immediately
applied
his
attention
to
the
further
development
of
his
bright
idea
assisted
by
his
father
elisha
waters
the
enterprise
was
commenced
by
taking
a
wooden
shell
thirteen
inches
wide
and
thirty
feet
long
as
a
mould
and
covering
the
entire
surface
of
its
bottom
and
sides
with
small
sheets
of
strong
manila
paper
glued
together
and
superposed
on
each
other
so
that
the
joints
of
one
layer
were
covered
by
the
middle
of
the
sheet
immediately
above
until
a
sheet
of
paper
had
been
formed
of
an
inch
in
thickness
the
fabric
thus
constructed
after
being
carefully
dried
was
removed
from
the
mould
and
fitted
up
with
a
suitable
frame
consisting
of
a
lower
keelson
two
inwales
the
bulkhead
in
short
all
the
usual
parts
of
the
frame
of
a
wooden
shell
except
the
timbers
or
ribs
of
which
none
were
used
the
extreme
stiffness
of
the
skin
rendering
them
unnecessary
its
surface
was
then
carefully
waterproofed
with
suitable
varnishes
and
the
work
was
completed
trials
proved
that
rude
as
was
this
first
attempt
compared
with
the
elegant
craft
now
turned
out
from
paper
it
had
marked
merits
among
which
were
its
remarkable
stiffness
the
symmetry
of
the
hull
with
respect
to
its
long
axis
and
the
smoothness
of
the
a
gentleman
who
possesses
excellent
judgment
and
long
experience
in
all
that
relates
to
paper
boats
furnishes
me
with
the
following
valuable
information
which
i
feel
sure
will
interest
the
reader
the
process
of
building
the
paper
is
as
follows
the
dimensions
of
the
boat
having
been
determined
upon
the
first
step
is
to
construct
a
wooden
model
or
form
an
exact
facsimile
of
the
desired
boat
on
which
to
mould
the
paper
skin
for
this
purpose
the
lines
of
the
boat
are
carefully
drawn
out
of
the
full
size
and
from
the
drawings
thus
made
the
model
is
prepared
it
is
built
of
layers
of
pine
securely
fastened
together
to
form
one
solid
mass
which
after
having
been
laid
up
of
the
general
outline
required
is
carefully
worked
off
until
its
surface
which
is
made
perfectly
smooth
exactly
conforms
to
the
selected
lines
and
its
beam
depth
and
length
are
those
of
the
given
boat
during
the
process
of
its
construction
suitable
rabbets
are
cut
to
receive
the
lower
keelson
the
two
inwales
and
the
bow
and
stern
deadwoods
which
being
put
in
position
are
worked
off
so
that
their
surfaces
are
flush
with
that
of
the
model
and
forming
as
it
were
an
integral
part
of
it
it
being
important
that
these
parts
should
in
the
completed
boat
be
firmly
attached
to
the
skin
their
surface
is
at
this
part
of
the
process
covered
with
a
suitable
adhesive
preparation
the
model
is
now
ready
to
be
covered
with
paper
two
kinds
are
used
that
made
from
the
best
manila
and
that
prepared
from
pure
unbleached
linen
stock
the
sheets
being
the
full
length
of
the
model
no
matter
what
that
may
be
if
manila
paper
is
used
the
first
sheet
is
dampened
laid
smoothly
on
the
model
and
securely
fastened
in
place
by
tacking
it
to
certain
rough
strips
attached
to
its
upper
face
other
sheets
are
now
superposed
on
this
and
on
each
other
and
suitably
cemented
together
the
number
depending
upon
the
size
of
the
boat
and
the
stiffness
required
if
linen
paper
is
used
but
one
sheet
is
employed
of
such
weight
and
dimensions
that
when
dry
it
will
give
just
the
thickness
of
skin
necessary
should
the
surface
of
the
model
be
concave
in
parts
as
in
the
run
of
boats
with
square
sterns
for
instance
the
paper
is
made
to
conform
to
these
surfaces
by
suitable
convex
moulds
which
also
hold
the
paper
in
place
until
by
drying
it
has
taken
and
will
retain
the
desired
form
the
model
with
its
enveloping
coat
of
paper
is
now
removed
to
the
as
the
paper
skin
dries
all
wrinkles
disappear
and
it
gradually
assumes
the
desired
shape
finally
when
all
moisture
has
been
evaporated
it
is
taken
from
the
mould
an
exact
of
the
model
desired
exceedingly
stiff
perfectly
symmetrical
and
seamless
the
paper
is
now
subjected
to
the
process
and
the
skin
with
its
keelson
inwales
and
attached
is
then
placed
in
the
carpenter
hands
where
the
frame
is
completed
in
the
usual
manner
as
described
for
wooden
boats
the
paper
decks
being
put
on
it
is
then
ready
for
the
brass
iron
and
varnish
work
as
the
skins
of
these
boats
vary
from
of
an
inch
in
the
singles
to
of
an
inch
in
the
outriggers
the
wooden
frame
becomes
necessary
to
support
and
keep
them
in
shape
in
applying
this
invention
to
gigs
dingys
canoes
and
skiffs
a
somewhat
different
method
is
adopted
since
these
boats
are
subjected
to
much
hard
service
and
must
be
so
constructed
as
to
permit
the
occupant
to
move
about
in
them
as
is
usual
in
such
craft
a
light
and
strong
frame
of
wood
is
prepared
composed
of
a
suitable
number
of
pairs
of
ribs
with
stem
and
stern
pieces
cut
from
the
natural
crooks
of
hackmatack
roots
these
are
firmly
framed
to
two
gunwales
and
a
keelson
extending
the
length
of
the
boat
the
whole
forming
the
skeleton
shape
of
the
desired
model
the
forms
for
these
boats
having
been
prepared
as
already
described
for
the
and
the
frame
being
let
into
this
form
so
that
the
outer
surface
of
the
ribs
stem
and
stern
pieces
will
conform
with
its
outer
surface
the
paper
skin
is
next
laid
upon
it
the
skin
manufactured
from
new
unbleached
linen
stock
is
carefully
stretched
in
place
and
when
perfectly
dry
is
from
to
of
an
inch
thick
removed
from
the
model
it
is
the
frame
and
fittings
completed
and
the
boat
varnished
in
short
in
this
class
of
boats
the
shape
style
and
finish
are
precisely
that
of
wooden
ones
of
corresponding
dimensions
and
class
except
that
for
the
usual
wooden
sheathing
is
substituted
the
paper
skin
as
described
the
advantages
possessed
by
these
boats
over
those
of
wood
are
by
the
use
of
this
material
for
the
skins
of
where
experience
has
demonstrated
the
smooth
bottom
to
be
the
best
lines
of
any
degree
of
fineness
can
be
developed
which
can
not
successfully
be
produced
in
those
of
wood
even
where
the
streaks
are
so
reduced
in
thickness
that
strength
stiffness
and
durability
are
either
wholly
sacrificed
or
greatly
impaired
in
the
finer
varieties
of
equally
fine
lines
can
be
obtained
but
so
delicate
are
such
boats
if
the
sides
are
reduced
to
of
an
inch
or
less
in
thickness
that
it
is
found
practically
impossible
to
preserve
their
original
forms
for
any
length
of
time
hence
so
far
as
this
point
is
concerned
it
only
remains
for
the
builder
to
select
those
models
which
science
guided
by
experience
points
out
as
the
best
the
paper
skin
after
being
is
finished
with
hard
varnishes
and
then
presents
a
solid
perfectly
smooth
and
horny
surface
to
the
action
of
the
water
unbroken
by
joint
lap
or
seam
this
surface
admits
of
being
polished
as
smooth
as
a
or
a
mirror
unlike
wood
it
has
no
grain
to
be
cracked
or
split
it
never
shrinks
and
paper
being
one
of
the
best
of
no
ordinary
degree
of
heat
or
cold
affects
its
shape
or
hardness
and
hence
these
boats
are
admirably
adapted
for
use
in
all
climates
as
the
skin
absorbs
no
moisture
these
boats
gain
no
weight
by
use
and
having
no
moisture
to
give
off
when
out
of
the
water
they
do
not
like
wooden
boats
show
the
effect
of
exposure
to
the
air
by
leaking
they
are
therefore
in
this
respect
always
prepared
for
service
the
strength
and
stiffness
of
the
paper
shells
are
most
remarkable
to
demonstrate
it
a
single
shell
of
twelve
inch
beam
and
feet
long
fitted
complete
with
its
outriggers
the
hull
weighing
pounds
was
placed
on
two
trestles
eight
feet
apart
in
such
a
manner
that
the
trestles
were
each
the
same
distance
from
the
centre
of
the
cockpit
which
was
thus
entirely
unsupported
a
man
weighing
one
hundred
and
forty
pounds
then
seated
himself
in
it
and
remained
in
this
position
three
minutes
the
deflection
caused
by
this
strain
being
accurately
measured
was
found
to
be
of
an
inch
at
a
point
midway
between
the
supports
if
this
load
applied
under
such
abnormal
conditions
produced
so
little
effect
we
can
safely
assume
that
when
thus
loaded
and
resting
on
the
water
supported
throughout
her
whole
length
and
the
load
far
more
equally
distributed
over
the
whole
frame
there
would
be
no
deflection
whatever
lightness
when
combined
with
a
proper
stiffness
and
strength
being
a
very
desirable
quality
it
is
here
that
the
paper
boats
far
excel
their
wooden
rivals
if
two
shells
are
selected
the
one
of
wood
and
the
other
with
a
paper
skin
and
deck
as
has
been
described
of
the
same
dimensions
and
equally
stiff
careful
experiment
proves
that
the
wooden
one
will
be
thirty
per
cent
the
heaviest
if
those
of
the
same
dimensions
and
equal
weight
are
compared
the
paper
one
will
be
found
to
exceed
the
wooden
one
in
stiffness
and
in
capacity
to
resist
torsional
strains
in
the
same
proportion
frequent
boasts
are
made
that
wooden
shells
can
be
and
are
built
much
lighter
than
paper
ones
and
if
the
quality
of
lightness
alone
is
considered
this
is
true
yet
when
the
practical
test
of
use
is
applied
such
extremely
light
wooden
boats
have
always
proved
and
will
continue
to
prove
failures
as
here
this
quality
is
only
one
of
a
number
which
combine
to
make
the
boat
serviceable
a
wooden
shell
whose
hull
weighs
pounds
honest
weight
is
a
very
fragile
affair
a
paper
shell
of
the
same
dimensions
and
of
the
same
weight
will
last
as
long
and
do
as
much
work
as
a
wooden
one
whose
hull
turns
the
beam
at
thirty
pounds
an
instance
of
their
remarkable
strength
is
shown
in
the
following
case
in
the
summer
of
a
single
shell
while
being
rowed
at
full
speed
with
the
current
on
one
of
our
principal
rivers
was
run
into
to
the
stone
abutment
of
a
bridge
the
bow
struck
squarely
on
to
obstacle
and
such
was
the
momentum
of
the
mass
that
the
oarsman
was
thrown
directly
through
the
flaring
bow
of
the
cockpit
into
the
river
witnesses
of
the
accident
who
were
familiar
with
wooden
shells
declared
that
the
boat
was
ruined
but
after
a
careful
examination
only
the
was
found
to
be
twisted
in
a
spiral
form
and
the
washboard
broken
at
the
point
by
the
oarsman
as
he
passed
between
the
sides
two
dollars
covered
the
cost
of
repair
had
it
been
a
wooden
shell
the
shock
would
have
crushed
its
stem
and
splintered
the
skin
from
the
bow
to
the
waist

to
dissuade

at

by
using

the
centennial

of

settled
all

as
to
the
value
of
the

of
the

in

it
is
not
many
years
since
mcgregor

built
the
little
rob
roy
canoe
and
in
it
made
the
tour
of
interesting
european
waters
his
example
was
followed
by
an
army
of

it
is
now
a
common
thing
to
meet
canoe
voyagers
in
miniature
flotillas
upon
the
watercourses

which
possesses
a

is
therefore
a
better
boat
for
rough
water
than
the
rob

the
new

canoe
club
have
adopted
the

for

we
still
need
a

more
like
the

indian
canoe
than
the

these
modern

in

we
are

to

a

a
soft

pervaded
the
atmosphere
while
at
the

time
the

air
was
gently
exhilarating
to
the
nervous
system
at
six
the
canoe
arrived
at
hudson
city
which
is
on
the
east
bank
of
the
river
and
i
completed
a
row
of
statute
miles
according
to
local
authority
but
in
reality
miles
by
the
correct
charts
of
the
united

coast
survey
after
storing
the
maria

in
a
shed
i
repaired
to
a
dismal
hotel
for
the
night
at
seven
the
next
morning
the
river
was
mantled
in
a
dense
fog
but
i
pushed
off
and
guided
myself
by
the
sounds
of
the
running
trains
on
the
hudson
river
railroad
this
corporation
does
such
an
immense
amount
of
freighting
that
if
their
freight
trains
were
connected
a
continuous
line
of
eighty
miles
would
be
constructed
of
which
sixteen
miles
are
always
in
transit
day
and
night
steamboats
and
tugs
with
in
tow
were
groping
about
the
river
in
the
misty
darkness
blowing
whistles
every
few
minutes
to
let
people
know
that
the
pilot
was
not
sleeping
at
the
wheel
there
was
a
grand
clearing
up
at
noon
and
as
the
sun
broke
through
the
mist
the
beautiful
shores
came
into
view
like
a
vivid
flame
of
scarlet
yellow
brown
and
green
it
was
the
of
summer
and
her
dying
notes
the
tinted
leaves
each
one
giving
to
the
wind
a
sad
strain
as
it
softly
dropped
to
the

was
quickly
hurled

had
to
combat
it
for
several

i
easily
reached

was
upon

seven
the
next

the

invests
hundreds
of

along

of

now
the
narrows
above

point
were
entered
and
the
current
against
a
made
the
passage
unusually
exciting
the
paper
canoe
danced
over
the
boiling
expanse
of
water
and
neared
the
west
shore
about
a
mile
above
the
united
states
military
academy
when
a
shell
from
a
gun
on
the
grounds
of
that
institution
burst
in
the
water
within
a
few
feet
of
the
boat
i
now
observed
a
target
set
upon
a
little
flat
at
the
foot
of
a
gravelly
hill
close
to
the
beach
as
a
second
and
finally
a
third
shell
exploded
near
me
i
rowed
into
the
rough
water
much
disgusted
with
and
military
etiquette
after
dark
the
canoe
was
landed
on
the
deck
of
a
schooner
which
was
discharging
slag
or
cinder
at
fort
montgomery
landing
i
scrambled
up
the
hill
to
the
only
shelter
that
could
be
found
a
small
country
store
owned
by
a
captain
conk
who
kept
entertainment
for
the
traveller
rough
fellows
and
old
crones
came
in
to
talk
about
the
spooks
that
had
been
seen
in
the
neighboring
hills
it
was
veritable
sleepy
hollow
talk
the
physician
of
the
place
they
said
had
been
skert
clean
off
a
bridge
the
other
night
embarking
the
following
morning
from
this
weird
and
hilly
country
that
prominent
natural
feature
anthony
nose
which
was
located
on
the
opposite
shore
strongly
appealed
to
my
imagination
and
somewhat
excited
my
mirth
one
needs
a
powerful
imagination
i
thought
to
live
in
these
regions
where
the
native
element
the
dwell
so
fondly
and
earnestly
upon
the
ghostly
and
mysterious
three
miles
down
the
river
dunderberg
the
thundering
mountain
on
the
west
bank
with
the
town
of
peekskill
on
the
opposite
shore
was
passed
and
i
entered
haverstraw
bay
the
widest
part
of
the
river
here
says
the
historian
the
fresh
and
salt
water
usually
contend
most
equally
for
the
mastery
and
here
the
porpoise
is
often
seen
in
large
numbers
sporting
in
the
summer
sun
here
in
the
spring
vast
numbers
of
shad
are
caught
while
on
their
way
to
in
freshwater
coves
haverstraw
bay
was
crossed
and
tarrytown
passed
when
i
came
to
the
picturesque
little
cottage
of
a
great
man
now
gone
from
among
us
many
pleasant
memories
of
his
tales
rose
in
my
mind
as
i
looked
upon
sunnyside
the
home
of
washington
irving
nestled
in
the
grove
of
living
green
its
white
stuccoed
walls
glistening
in
the
bright
sunlight
and
its
background
of
grand
villas
looming
up
on
every
side
at
irvington
landing
a
little
further
down
the
river
i
went
ashore
to
pass
sunday
with
friends
and
on
the
monday
following
in
a
dense
fog
proceeded
on
my
route
to
new
york
below
irvington
the
palisades
precipices
of
offer
their
grandest
appearance
on
the
west
side
of
the
hudson
these
singular
bluffs
near
hoboken
present
a
perpendicular
front
of
three
hundred
or
four
hundred
feet
in
height
piles
of
broken
rock
rest
against
their
base
the
contribution
of
the
cliffs
above
from
the
effects
of
frost
and
sun
while
approaching
the
great
city
of
new
york
strong
squalls
of
wind
blowing
against
the
sent
swashy
waves
into
my
open
canoe
the
sides
of
which
amidships
were
only
five
or
six
inches
above
water
but
the
great
buoyancy
of
the
light
craft
and
its
very
smooth
exterior
created
but
little
friction
in
the
water
and
made
her
very
seaworthy
when
carefully
watched
and
handled
even
without
a
deck
of
canvas
or
wood
while
the
canoe
forged
ahead
through
the
troubled
waters
and
the
breezes
loaded
with
the
saltness
of
the
sea
now
near
at
hand
struck
my
back
i
confess
that
a
longing
to
reach
philadelphia
where
i
could
complete
my
outfit
and
increase
the
safety
of
my
little
craft
gave
renewed
vigor
to
my
stroke
as
i
exchanged
the
quiet
atmosphere
of
the
country
for
the
smoke
and
noise
of
the
city
every
instinct
was
now
challenged
and
every
muscle
brought
into
action
as
i
dodged
steamers
yachts
and
vessels
while
running
the
thoroughfare
along
the
crowded
wharves
between
new
york
on
one
side
and
jersey
city
on
the
other
i
found
the
slips
between
the
piers
most
excellent
ports
of
refuge
at
times
when
the
following
each
other
in
quick
succession
made
the
river
with
its
angry
tide
boil
like
a
vortex
the
task
soon
ended
and
i
left
the
hudson
at
castle
garden
and
entered
the
upper
bay
of
new
york
harbor
as
it
was
dark
i
would
gladly
have
gone
ashore
for
the
night
but
a
great
city
offers
no
inducement
for
a
canoeist
to
land
as
a
stranger
at
its
wharves
a
much
more
pleasant
reception
awaited
me
down
on
staten
island
a
gentleman
having
notified
me
by
mail
that
he
would
welcome
the
canoe
and
its
owner
the
ebb
had
ceased
and
the
incoming
tide
was
being
already
felt
close
in
shore
so
with
tide
and
wind
against
me
and
the
darkness
of
night
settling
down
gloomily
upon
the
wide
bay
i
pulled
a
strong
oar
for
five
miles
to
the
entrance
of
kill
van
kull
strait
which
separates
staten
island
from
new
jersey
and
connects
the
upper
bay
with
raritan
bay
the
bright
beams
from
the
on
robbin
reef
which
is
one
mile
and
a
quarter
off
the
entrance
of
the
strait
guided
me
on
my
course
the
in
little
splashy
waves
began
to
fill
my
canoe
the
water
soon
reached
the
but
there
was
no
time
to
stop
to
bale
out
the
boat
for
a
friendly
current
was
near
and
if
once
reached
my
little
craft
would
enter
smoother
waters
the
flood
which
poured
into
the
mouth
of
kill
van
kull
soon
caught
my
boat
and
the
was
changed
to
a
favorable
current
which
carried
me
in
its
strong
arms
far
into
the
strait
and
i
reached
west
new
brighton
along
the
high
banks
of
which
i
found
my
haven
of
rest
against
the
sky
i
traced
the
outlines
of
my
three
poplars
standing
before
the
house
of
the
gentleman
who
had
so
kindly
offered
me
his
hospitality
the
canoe
was
emptied
of
its
shifting
liquid
ballast
and
carefully
sponged
dry
my
host
and
his
son
carried
it
into
the
main
hall
of
the
mansion
and
placed
it
upon
the
floor
where
the
entire
household
gathered
an
admiring
group
proud
indeed
might
my
dainty
craft
have
been
of
the
appreciation
of
so
lovely
a
company
her
master
fully
appreciated
the
generous
board
of
his
kind
host
and
in
present
comfort
soon
forgot
past
trials
and
his
wet
pull
across
the
upper
bay
of
new
york
harbor
my
work
for
the
next
day
october
was
the
navigation
of
the
interesting
strait
of
the
old
dutch
settlers
and
the
raritan
river
of
new
jersey
as
far
as
new
brunswick
the
average
width
of
kill
van
kull
is
of
a
mile
from
its
entrance
at
constable
point
to
the
mouth
of
newark
bay
which
enters
it
on
the
jersey
side
it
is
three
miles
and
nearly
two
miles
across
the
bay
to
elizabethport
bergen
point
is
on
the
east
and
elizabethport
on
the
west
entrance
of
the
bay
while
on
staten
island
new
brighton
factoryville
and
north
shore
furnish
homes
for
many
new
york
business
men
at
elizabethport
the
strait
narrows
to
one
eighth
of
a
mile
and
as
the
mouth
of
the
rahway
is
approached
it
widens
it
now
runs
through
marshes
for
most
of
the
way
a
distance
of
twelve
miles
to
raritan
bay
which
is
an
arm
of
the
lower
bay
of
new
york
harbor
the
strait
from
elizabethport
to
its
mouth
is
called
arthur
kill
the
whole
distance
through
the
kills
from
constable
point
to
raritan
bay
is
about
seventeen
statute
miles
at
the
mouth
of
arthur
kill
the
raritan
river
opens
to
the
bay
and
the
city
of
perth
amboy
rests
on
the
point
of
high
land
between
the
river
and
the
strait
roseville
and
tottenville
are
on
the
staten
island
shores
of
arthur
kill
the
former
six
miles
the
latter
ten
miles
from
elizabethport
the
tide
runs
swiftly
through
the
kills
leaving
campbell
residence
at
nine
with
a
tide
in
my
favor
as
far
as
newark
bay
i
soon
had
the
tide
against
me
from
the
other
kill
until
i
passed
the
rahway
river
when
it
commenced
to
ebb
towards
raritan
bay
the
marshy
shores
of
the
kills
were
submerged
in
places
by
the
high
tide
but
their
monotony
was
relieved
by
the
farms
upon
the
hills
back
of
the
flats
at
one
my
canoe
rounded
the
heights
upon
which
perth
amboy
is
perched
with
its
snug
cottages
the
homes
of
many
oystermen
whose
fleet
of
boats
was
anchored
in
front
of
the
town
curious
pens
constructed
of
poles
rose
out
of
the
water
in
which
boats
could
find
shelter
from
the
rough
sea
the
entrance
to
the
raritan
river
is
wide
and
above
its
mouth
it
is
crossed
by
a
long
railroad
bridge
the
pull
up
the
crooked
river
sixteen
miles
against
a
strong
through
extensive
reedy
marshes
was
uninteresting
i
came
upon
the
entrance
of
the
canal
which
connects
the
rivers
raritan
and
delaware
after
six
which
at
this
season
of
the
year
was
after
dark
hiding
the
canoe
in
a
secure
place
i
went
to
visit
an
old
friend
professor
george
cook
of
the
new
jersey
state
geological
survey
who
resides
at
new
brunswick
in
the
morning
the
professor
kindly
assisted
me
and
we
climbed
the
high
bank
of
the
canal
with
the
canoe
upon
our
shoulders
putting
it
into
the
water
below
the
first
two
locks
i
now
commenced
an
unexciting
row
of
miles
to
bordentown
on
the
delaware
where
this
artificial
watercourse
ends
this
canal
is
much
travelled
by
steam
tugs
towing
schooners
of
two
hundred
tons
and
by
barges
and
of
all
sizes
drawing
not
above
seven
feet
and
a
half
of
water
the
boats
are
drawn
through
the
locks
by
stationary
the
use
of
which
is
discontinued
when
the
business
becomes
slack
then
the
boatmen
use
their
mules
for
the
same
purpose
to
tow
an
loaded
requires
four
mules
while
an
empty
one
is
easily
drawn
by
two
it
proved
most
expeditious
as
well
as
convenient
not
to
trouble
the
to
open
the
gates
but
to
secure
his
assistance
in
carrying
the
canoe
along
the
to
the
end
of
the
lock
which
service
occupied
less
than
five
minutes
in
this
way
the
canoe
was
carried
around
seven
locks
the
first
day
and
when
dusk
approached
she
was
sheltered
beside
a
paper
shell
in
the
of
princeton
college
club
which
is
located
on
the
banks
of
the
canal
about
one
mile
and
a
half
from
the
city
of
princeton
in
this
narrow
watercourse
these
indefatigable
collegians
under
great
disadvantages
drill
their
crews
for
the
annual
intercollegiate
struggle
for
championship
one
noah
reed
provided
entertainment
for
man
and
beast
at
his
country
inn
half
a
mile
from
the
and
thither
i
repaired
for
the
night
this
day
row
of
miles
and
a
half
had
been
through
a
hilly
country
abounding
in
rich
farm
lands
which
were
well
cultivated
the
next
morning
an
officer
of
the
princeton
bank
awaited
my
coming
on
the
banks
of
the
sluggish
canal
he
had
taken
an
early
walk
from
the
town
to
see
the
canoe
at
baker
basin
the
a
man
pressed
me
to
tarry
till
he
could
summon
the
methodist
minister
who
had
charged
him
to
notify
him
of
the
approach
of
a
paper
canoe
through
all
my
boat
journeys
i
have
remarked
that
professional
men
take
more
interest
in
canoe
journeys
than
professional
oarsmen
and
nearly
all
the
canoeists
of
my
acquaintance
are
ministers
of
the
gospel
it
is
an
innocent
way
of
obtaining
relaxation
and
opportunities
thus
offered
the
weary
clergyman
of
studying
nature
in
her
but
always
restful
moods
must
indeed
be
grateful
after
being
for
months
in
daily
contact
with
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
the
tendency
of
the
present
age
to
liberal
ideas
permits
clergymen
in
large
towns
and
cities
to
drive
fast
horses
and
spend
an
hour
of
each
day
at
a
harmless
game
of
billiards
without
giving
rise
to
remarks
from
his
own
congregation
but
let
the
overworked
rector
of
a
country
village
seek
in
his
friendly
canoe
that
relief
which
nature
offers
to
the
tired
brain
let
him
go
into
the
wilderness
and
live
close
to
his
creator
by
studying
his
works
and
a
whole
community
vex
him
on
his
return
with
the
appearance
of
the
thing
these
critics
who
are
generally
ignorant
of
the
laws
which
god
has
made
to
secure
health
and
give
contentment
to
his
creatures
would
poison
the
sick
man
body
with
drugs
and
nostrums
when
he
might
have
the
delightful
and
generally
successful
services
of
camp
cure
without
the
after
dose
of
a
bill
these
hardworked
and
miserably
paid
country
clergymen
who
are
rarely
nowadays
treated
as
the
head
of
the
congregation
or
the
shepherd
of
the
flock
they
are
supposed
to
lead
but
rather
as
victims
of
the
whims
of
influential
members
of
the
church
tell
me
that
to
own
a
canoe
is
indeed
a
cross
and
that
if
they
spend
a
vacation
in
the
grand
old
forests
of
the
adirondacks
the
brethren
are
sorely
exercised
over
the
time
wasted
in
such
unusual
and
unministerial
conduct
everywhere
along
the
route
the
peculiar
character
of
the
paper
canoe
attracted
many
remarks
from
the
bystanders
the
first
impression
given
was
that
i
had
engaged
in
this
rowing
enterprise
under
the
stimulus
of
a
bet
and
when
the
curious
were
informed
that
it
was
a
voyage
of
study
the
next
question
was
how
much
are
you
going
to
make
out
of
it
upon
learning
that
there
was
neither
a
bet
nor
money
in
it
a
shade
of
disappointment
and
incredulity
rested
upon
the
features
of
the
bystanders
and
the
canoeist
was
often
rated
as
a
blockhead
for
risking
his
life
without
being
paid
for
it
at
trenton
the
canal
passes
through
the
city
and
here
it
was
necessary
to
carry
the
boat
around
two
locks
at
noon
the
canoe
ended
her
voyage
of
miles
by
reaching
the
last
lock
on
the
delaware
river
at
bordentown
new
jersey
where
friendly
arms
received
the
maria
theresa
and
placed
her
on
the
trestles
which
had
supported
her
sister
craft
the
mayeta
in
the
shop
of
the
builder
lamson
situated
under
the
high
cliffs
along
the
crests
of
which
an
of
spain
in
times
gone
by
was
wont
to
walk
and
sadly
ponder
on
his
exile
from
la
belle
france
the
rev
john
barkeley
proprietor
as
well
as
principal
of
the
bordentown
female
seminary
took
me
to
his
ancient

thomas

times
had
lodged
not

in
the

of
my
friend

the
group
of
fifty
young
ladies
who
were
kind
enough
to
gather
upon
a
high
bluff
when
i
left
the
town
and
wave
graceful
farewell
to
the
paper
canoe
as
she
entered

beautifully
laid
out

of

in
grateful
remembrance
the
favors
showered
upon

had
refused
him
so
he
settled
upon
the
lovely
shores
of

lavished
his

upon
the

of

kindly
received

somewhat

in
which
philadelphia
abounds
and
which
are
rarely
sought
out
by

two
especially
claim
the
attention
of
the
naturalist
one
is
the
old
home
of
william
bartram
on
the
banks
of
the
schuylkill
at
grey
ferry
the
other
the
grave
of
alexander
wilson
friends
and
in
extended
field
the
first
a
botanist
the
second
the
father
of
american
ornithology
william
bartram
son
of
the
john
bartram
who
was
the
founder
of
the
botanic
garden
on
the
west
bank
of
the
schuylkill
was
born
at
that
interesting
spot
in
all
botanists
are
familiar
with
the
results
of
his
patient
labors
and
his
pioneer
travels
in
those
early
days
through
the
wilderness
of
what
now
constitutes
the
southeastern
states
one
who
visited
him
at
his
home
says
arrived
at
the
botanist
garden
we
approached
an
old
man
who
with
a
rake
in
his
hand
was
breaking
the
clods
of
earth
in
a
his
hat
was
old
and
flapped
over
his
etee
his
coarse
shirt
was
seen
near
his
neck
as
he
wore
no
cravat
nor
kerchief
his
waistcoat
and
breeches
were
both
of
leather
and
his
shoes
were
tied
with
leather
strings
we
approached
and
accosted
him
he
ceased
his
work
and
entered
into
conversation
with
the
ease
and
politeness
of
nature
nobleman
his
countenance
was
expressive
of
benignity
and
happiness
this
was
the
botanist
traveller
and
philosopher
we
had
come
to
see
william
bartram
gave
important
assistance
and
encouragement
to
the
friendless
scotch
pedagogue
alexander
wilson
while
the
latter
was
preparing
his
american
ornithology
for
the
press
this
industrious
and
peaceable
botanist
died
within
the
walls
of
his
home
a
few
minutes
after
he
had
penned
a
description
of
a
plant
he
died
in
in
the
year
of
his
age
the
old
house
of
john
and
william
bartram
remains
nearly
the
same
as
when
the
last
bartram
died
but
the
grounds
have
been
occupied
and
improved
by
the
present
proprietor
whose
fine
mansion
is
near
the
old
residence
of
the
two
botanists
without
ample
funds
to
enable
him
to
carry
out
his
bold
design
alexander
wilson
labored
and
suffered
in
body
and
mind
for
several
years
until
his
patient
and
persistent
efforts
achieved
the
success
they
so
richly
merited
all
but
the
last
volume
of
his
american
ornithology
were
completed
when
the
overworked
naturalist
died
the

in

the
swedes
had
settlements
on
the

visited

they
built
a
wooden
edifice
for
worship
in
on
the
spot
where
the
brick

now
stands
and
which
was
erected
in

narrow
streets
with

stenographic
reporter
of

courts
a

for
my
guide
we
came
into
a
quiet
locality
where
the
ancient
landmark
reared
its
steeple
like
the
finger
of
faith
pointing
heavenward
few
indeed
must
be
the
fashionable
christians
who
worship
under
its
unpretentious
roof
but
there
is
an
air
of
antiquity
surrounding
it
which
interests
every
visitor
who
enters
its
venerable
doorway
the
is
very
contracted

yet
there
is
room
for
trees
to
grow
within
its
sacred
precincts

rest
there
while
pursuing
their
flight

the
crowded
graves
is
a
square
brick
structure
covered
with

the

sank
into
the
gloom
of

the
clouds

which
enveloped
it
this
pull
was
an
exceedingly
dreary
one
the
storms

were
at
hand

even

possession

being
fastened
by
buttons
along

securely
covered
the

which
lighted
up
the
dismal
hovel
most
cheerfully
and
thus
i
kept
house
in
a
comfortable
manner
till
morning
being
well
satisfied
with
the
progress
i
had
made
that
day
in
traversing
the
shores
of
three
states
the
booming
of
the
guns
of
shooters
out
upon
the
water
roused
me
before
dawn
and
i
had
ample
time
before
the
sun
arose
to
prepare
breakfast
from
the
remnant
of
canned
soup
left
over
from
last
night
supper
i
was
now
in
delaware
bay
which
was
assuming
noble
proportions
from
my
camp
i
crossed
to
the
west
shore
below
reedy
island
and
filling
my
at
a
kept
upon
that
shore
all
day
the
wind
arose
stirring
up
a
rough
sea
as
i
approached
bombay
hook
where
the
bay
is
eight
miles
wide
i
tried
to
land
upon
the
salt
marshes
over
the
edges
of
which
the
long
low
seas
were
breaking
but
failed
in
several
attempts
at
last
roller
after
roller
following
in
quick
succession
carried
the
little
craft
on
their
crests
to
the
land
and
packed
her
in
a
thicket
of
high
reeds
i
quickly
disembarked
believing
it
useless
to
attempt
to
go
further
that
day
about
an
eighth
of
a
mile
from
the
water
rising
out
of
the
salt
grass
and
reeds
was
a
little
mound
covered
by
trees
and
bushes
into
which
i
conveyed
my
cargo
by
the
and
then
easily
drew
the
light
canoe
over
the
level
marsh
to
the
camp
a
bed
of
reeds
was
soon
cut
into
which
the
canoe
was
settled
to
prevent
her
from
being
strained
by
the
occupant
at
night
for
i
was
determined
to
test
the
strength
of
the
boat
as
canoes
built
for
one
person
are
generally
too
light
for
such
occupancy
when
out
of
water
the
tall
fringe
of
reeds
which
encircled
the
boat
formed
an
excellent
substitute
for
chamber
walls
giving
me
all
the
starry
blue
heavens
for
a
ceiling
and
most
effectually
screening
me
from
the
strong
wind
which
was
blowing
as
it
was
early
when
the
boat
was
driven
ashore
i
had
time
to
wander
down
to
the
brook
which
was
a
mile
distant
and
replenish
my
scanty
stock
of
water
with
the
canvas
and
rubber
blanket
to
keep
off
the
heavy
dews
the
first
night
passed
in
such
contracted
lodgings
was
endurable
if
not
wholly
convenient
and
agreeable
the
river
mists
were
not
dispelled
the
next
day
until
nine
when
i
quitted
my
warm
nest
in
the
reeds
and
rowed
down
the
bay
which
seemed
to
grow
broader
as
i
advanced
the
bay
was
still
bordered
by
extensive
marshes
with
here
and
there
the
habitation
of
man
located
upon
some
slight
elevation
of
the
surface
having
rowed
miles
and
being
off
the
mouth
of
murderkill
creek
a
squall
struck
the
canoe
and
forced
it
on
to
an
oyster
reef
upon
the
sharp
shells
of
which
she
was
rocked
for
several
minutes
by
the
shallow
breakers
fearing
that
the
paper
shell
was
badly
cut
though
it
was
still
early
in
the
afternoon
i
ascended
the
creek
of
ominous
name
and
associations
to
the
landing
of
an
inn
kept
by
jacob
lavey
where
i
expected
to
overhaul
my
injured
craft
to
my
surprise
and
great
relief
of
mind
there
were
found
only
a
few
superficial
scratches
upon
the
shellacked
surface
of
the
paper
shell
to
apply
shellac
with
a
heated
iron
to
the
wounds
made
by
the
was
the
work
of
a
few
minutes
and
my
craft
was
as
sound
as
ever
the
gunner
resort
bower
beach
hotel
furnished
an
excellent
supper
of
oyster
fritters
panfish
and
fried
mine
host
before
a
blazing
wood
fire
told
me
of
the
origin
of
the
name
of
murderkill
creek
in
the
early
settlement
of
the
country
began
the
innkeeper
the
white
settlers
did
all
they
could
to
civilize
the
indians
but
the
cussed
savages
would
take
to
it
kindly
but
worried
the
life
out
of
the
at
last
a
great
landed
proprietor
who
held
a
big
grant
of
land
in
these
parts
thought
he
settle
the
troubles
so
he
planted
a
brass
cannon
near
the
creek
and
invited
all
the
indians
of
the
neighborhood
to
come
and
hear
the
white
man
great
spirit
talk
the
crafty
man
got
the
savages
before
the
mouth
of
the
cannon
and
said
look
into
the
hole
there
for
it
is
the
mouth
of
the
white
man
great
spirit
which
will
soon
speak
in
tones
of
thunder
the
fellow
then
touched
off
the
gun
and
knocked
half
the
devils
into
splinters
the
others
were
so
skeerd
at
the
big
voice
they
had
heard
that
they
were
afraid
to
move
and
were
soon
all
killed
by
one
charge
after
another
from
the
cannon
so
the
creek
has
been
called
murderkill
ever
since
i
afterwards
discovered
that
there
were
other
places
on
the
coast
which
had
the
same
legend
as
the
one
told
me
by
the
innkeeper
holders
of
small
farms
lived
in
the
vicinity
of
this
tavern
but
the
was
at
frederica
five
miles
inland
embarking
the
next
day
i
felt
sure
of
ending
my
cruise
on
delaware
bay
before
night
as
the
quiet
morning
exhibited
no
signs
of
rising
winds
the
little
pilot
town
of
lewes
near
cape
delaware
and
behind
the
breakwater
is
a
port
of
refuge
for
vessels
from
this
village
i
expected
to
make
a
portage
of
six
miles
to
love
creek
a
tributary
of
rehoboth
sound
the
frosty
nights
were
now
exerting
a
sanitary
influence
over
the
malarial
districts
which
i
had
entered
and
the
unacclimated
canoeist
of
northern
birth
could
safely
pursue
his
journey
and
sleep
at
night
in
the
swamps
along
the
streams
if
protected
from
the
dews
by
a
rubber
or
canvas
covering
my
hopes
of
reaching
the
open
sea
that
night
were
to
be
drowned
and
in
cold
water
too
for
that
day
which
opened
so
calmly
and
with
such
smiling
promises
was
destined
to
prove
a
season
of
trial
and
before
its
evening
shadows
closed
around
me
to
witness
a
severe
struggle
for
life
in
the
cold
waters
of
delaware
bay
an
hour
after
leaving
murderkill
creek
the
wind
came
from
the
north
in
strong
squalls
my
little
boat
taking
the
blasts
on
her
quarter
kept
herself
free
of
the
swashy
seas
hour
after
hour
i
kept
as
close
to
the
sandy
beach
of
the
great
marshes
as
possible
so
as
to
be
near
the
land
in
case
an
accident
should
happen
mispillion
creek
and
a
on
the
north
of
its
mouth
were
passed
when
the
wind
and
seas
struck
my
boat
on
the
port
beam
and
continually
crowded
her
ashore
the
water
breaking
on
the
hard
sandy
beach
of
the
marshy
coast
made
it
too
much
of
a
risk
to
attempt
a
landing
as
the
canoe
would
be
smothered
in
the
swashy
seas
if
her
head
way
was
checked
for
a
moment
amidships
the
canoe
was
only
a
few
inches
out
of
water
but
her
great
sheer
full
bow
and
smoothness
of
hull
with
watchful
management
kept
her
from
swamping
i
had
struggled
along
for
fourteen
miles
since
morning
and
was
fatigued
by
the
strain
consequent
upon
the
continued
manoeuvring
of
my
boat
through
the
rough
waves
i
reached
a
point
on
slaughter
beach
where
the
bay
has
a
width
of
nearly
nineteen
miles
when
the
tempest
rose
to
such
a
pitch
that
the
great
raging
seas
threatened
every
moment
to
wash
over
my
canoe
and
to
force
me
by
their
violence
close
into
the
beach
to
my
alarm
as
the
boat
rose
and
fell
upon
the
waves
the
heads
of
stakes
appeared
and
disappeared
in
the
broken
waters
they
were
the
stakes
of
fishermen
to
which
they
attach
their
nets
in
the
season
of
the
danger
of
being
impaled
on
one
of
these
forced
me
off
shore
again
there
was
no
undertow
the
seas
being
driven
over
shoals
were
irregular
and
broken
at
last
my
sea
came
it
rolled
up
without
a
crest
square
and
formidable
i
could
not
calculate
where
it
would
break
but
i
pulled
for
life
away
from
it
towards
the
beach
upon
which
the
sea
was
breaking
with
deafening
sound
it
was
only
for
a
moment
that
i
beheld
the
great
brown
wave
which
bore
with
it
the
mud
of
the
shoal
bearing
down
upon
me
for
the
next
it
broke
astern
sweeping
completely
over
the
canoe
from
stern
to
stem
filling
it
through
the
opening
of
the
canvas
round
my
body
then
for
a
while
the
watery
area
was
almost
smooth
so
completely
had
the
great
wave
levelled
it
the
canoe
being
settled
below
the
surface
the
high
points
of
the
ends
occasionally
emerging
from
the
water
other
heavy
seas
followed
the
first
one
of
which
striking
me
as
high
as
my
head
and
shoulders
turned
both
the
canoe
and
canoeist
a
capsize
in
delaware
bay
kicking
myself
free
of
the
canvas
deck
i
struck
out
from
under
the
shell
and
quickly
rose
to
the
surface
it
was
then
that
the
words
of
an
author
of
a
european
canoe
manual
came
to
my
mind
when
you
capsize
first
right
the
canoe
and
get
astride
it
over
one
end
keeping
your
legs
in
the
water
when
you
have
crawled
to
the
well
or
cockpit
bale
out
the
boat
with
your
hat
comforting
as
these
instructions
from
an
experienced
canoe
traveller
seemed
when
reading
them
in
my
hermitage
ashore
the
present
application
of
them
so
important
a
principle
in
captain
jack
bunsby
log
of
life
was
in
this
emergency
an
impossibility
for
my
hat
had
disappeared
with
the
and
one
iron
outrigger
while
the
oars
were
floating
to
leeward
with
the
canoe
the
boat
having
turned
keel
up
her
great
sheer
would
have
righted
her
had
it
not
been
for
the
cargo
which
settled
itself
on
the
canvas
and
ballasted
the
craft
in
that
position
so
smooth
were
her
polished
sides
that
it
was
impossible
to
hold
on
to
her
for
she
rolled
about
like
a
slippery
porpoise
in
a
tideway
having
tested
and
proved
futile
the
kind
suggestions
of
writers
on
marine
disasters
and
feeling
very
stiff
in
the
icy
water
i
struck
out
in
an
almost
exhausted
condition
for
the
shore
now
a
new
experience
taught
me
an
interesting
lesson
the
seas
rolled
over
my
head
and
shoulders
in
such
rapid
succession
that
i
found
i
could
not
get
my
head
above
water
to
breathe
while
the
sharp
sand
kept
in
suspension
by
the
agitated
water
scratched
my
face
and
filled
my
eyes
nostrils
and
ears
while
i
felt
this
pressing
down
and
burying
tendency
of
the
seas
as
they
broke
upon
my
head
and
shoulders
i
understood
the
reason
why
so
many
good
swimmers
are
drowned
in
attempting
to
reach
the
shore
from
a
wreck
on
a
shoal
when
the
wind
though
blowing
heavily
is
in
the
victim
favor
the
land
was
not
over
an
eighth
of
a
mile
away
and
from
it
came
the
sullen
roar
of
the
breakers
pounding
their
heavy
weight
upon
the
sandy
shingle
as
its
booming
thunders
or
its
angry
swashing
sound
increased
i
knew
i
was
rapidly
nearing
it
but
blinded
by
the
boiling
waters
i
could
see
nothing
at
such
a
moment
do
not
stop
to
make
vows
as
to
how
you
will
treat
your
neighbor
in
future
if
once
safely
landed
but
strike
out
fight
as
you
never
fought
before
swallowing
as
little
water
as
possible
and
never
relaxing
an
energy
or
yielding
a
hope
the
water
shoaled
my
feet
felt
the
bottom
and
i
stood
up
but
a
roller
laid
me
flat
on
my
face
up
again
and
down
again
swimming
and
crawling
i
emerged
from
the
sea
bearing
i
fear
a
closer
resemblance
to
jonah
being
at
last
pitched
on
shore
than
to
cabnel
venus
who
was
borne
gracefully
upon
the
rosy
crests
of
the
waves
to
the
soft
bed
of
sparkling
foam
awaiting
her
wearily
dragging
myself
up
the
hard
shingle
i
stood
and
contemplated
the
little
streams
of
water
pouring
from
my
woollen
clothes
a
new
danger
awaited
me
as
the
cold
wind
whistled
down
the
barren
beach
and
across
the
desolate
marshes
i
danced
about
to
keep
warm
and
for
a
moment
thought
that
my
canoe
voyage
had
come
to
an
unfortunate
termination
then
a
buoyant
feeling
succeeded
the
depression
and
i
felt
that
this
was
only
the
first
of
many
trials
which
were
necessary
to
prepare
me
for
the
successful
completion
of
my
undertaking
but
where
was
the
canoe
with
its
provisions
that
were
to
sustain
me
and
the
charts
which
were
to
point
out
my
way
through
the
labyrinth
of
waters
she
was
yet
to
traverse
she
had
drifted
near
the
shore
but
would
not
land
there
was
no
time
to
consider
the
propriety
of
again
entering
the
water
the
struggle
was
a
short
though
severe
one
and
i
dragged
my
boat
ashore
everything
was
wet
excepting
what
was
most
needed
a
flannel
suit
carefully
rolled
in
a
cloth
i
knew
that
i
must
change
my
wet
clothes
for
dry
ones
or
perish
this
was
no
easy
task
to
perform
with
hands
benumbed
and
limbs
paralyzed
with
the
cold
o
shade
of
benjamin
franklin
did
not
one
of
thy
kinsmen
in
his
wide
experience
as
a
traveller
foresee
this
very
disaster
and
did
he
not
when
i
left
the
city
of
brotherly
love
force
upon
me
an
antidote
a
sort
of
spiritual
fire
which
my
new
england
temperance
principles
made
me
refuse
to
accept
it
is
old
very
old
he
whispered
as
he
slipped
the
flask
into
my
pocket
and
it
may
save
your
life
do
be
foolish
i
have
kept
it
well
bottled
it
is
a
pure
article
and
cost
sixteen
dollars
per
gallon
i
use
it
only
for
medicine
i
found
the
flask
the
water
had
not
injured
it
a
small
quantity
was
taken
when
a
most
favorable
change
came
over
my
entire
system
mental
as
well
as
physical
and
i
was
able
to
throw
off
one
suit
and
put
on
another
in
the
icy
wind
that
might
without
the
stimulant
have
ended
my
voyage
of
life
i
had
doctored
myself
homoeopathically
under
the
old
practice
filled
with
feelings
of
gratitude
to
the
great
giver
of
good
i
reflected
as
i
carried
my
wet
cargo
into
the
marsh
upon
the
wonderful
effects
of
my
friend
medicine
when
taken
only
as
medicine
standing
upon
the
cold
beach
and
gazing
into
the
sea
now
lashed
by
the
wild
frenzy
of
the
wind
i
determined
never
again
to
do
so
mean
a
thing
as
to
say
a
word
against
good
brandy
having
relieved
my
conscience
by
this
just
resolve
i
transported
the
whole
of
my
wet
but
still
precious
cargo
to
a
persimmon
grove
on
a
spot
of
firm
land
that
rose
out
of
the
marsh
where
i
made
a
convenient
by
stretching
rubber
blankets
between
trees
on
this
knoll
i
built
a
fire
obtaining
the
matches
to
kindle
it
from
a
safe
presented
to
me
by
epes
sargent
of
boston
some
years
before
when
i
was
ascending
the
johns
river
florida
before
dusk
all
things
not
spoiled
by
the
water
were
dried
and
secreted
in
the
tall
sedge
of
the
marshes
the
elevation
which
had
given
me
friendly
shelter
is
known
as
hog
island
the
few
that
grew
upon
it
furnished
an
ample
lunch
for
the
frosts
had
mellowed
the
fruit
making
it
sweet
and
edible
the
persimmon
diospyrus
virginiana
is
a
small
tree
usually
found
in
the
middle
and
southern
states
coons
and
other
animals
feast
upon
its
fruit
the
deepening
gloom
warned
me
to
seek
comfortable
quarters
for
the
night
two
miles
up
the
strand
was
an
old
inn
to
which
i
bent
my
steps
along
slaughter
beach
praying
that
one
more
day
effort
would
take
me
out
of
this
bleak
region
of
ominous
names
a
pleasant
old
gentleman
charles
todd
kept
the
tavern
known
as
willow
grove
hotel
more
for
amusement
than
for
profit
i
said
nothing
to
him
about
the
peculiar
manner
in
which
i
had
landed
on
slaughter
beach
but
to
his
inquiry
as
to
where
my
boat
was
and
what
kind
of
a
boat
it
was
to
live
in
such
a
blow
i
replied
that
i
found
it
too
wet
and
cold
on
the
bay
to
remain
there
and
too
rough
to
proceed
to
cape
henlopen
and
there
being
no
alternative
i
was
obliged
to
land
much
against
my
inclination
and
in
doing
so
was
drenched
to
the
skin
but
had
managed
to
get
dry
before
a
fire
in
the
marshes
so
the
kind
old
man
piled
small
logs
in
the
great
kitchen
fireplace
and
told
me
tale
upon
tale
of
his
life
as
a
schoolmaster
out
west
of
the
death
of
his
wife
there
and
of
his
desire
to
return
after
long
years
of
absence
to
his
native
delaware
where
he
could
be
comfortable
and
have
all
the
clams
oysters
fish
and
bay
truck
generally
that
a
man
could
wish
for
now
he
added
i
shall
spend
my
last
days
here
in
peace
he
furnished
an
excellent
supper
of
or
sea
trout
otolithus
regalio
fried
oysters
sweet
potatoes
this
locality
offers
a
place
of
retirement
for
men
of
small
means
and
limited
ambition
the
broad
bay
is
a
good
sailing
and
fishing
ground
while
the
great
marshes
are
the
resort
of
many
birds
the
light
warm
soil
responds
generously
to
little
cultivation
after
a
day
of
hunting
and
fishing
the
can
smoke
his
pipe
in
peace
to
the
music
of
crackling
flames
in
the
wide
old
fireplace
here
he
may
be
comfortable
and
spend
his
last
days
quietly
vegetating
with
no
criticisms
on
his
deterioration
knowing
that
he
is
running
to
seed
no
faster
than
his
neighbors
the
wind
had
gone
to
rest
with
the
sun
and
the
sharp
frost
that
followed
left
its
congealed
breath
upon
the
shallow
pools
of
water
nearly
half
an
inch
in
thickness
by
morning
from
my
bed
i
could
see
through
the
window
the
bright
flashes
from
cape
may
and
cape
henlopen
lights
had
not
misfortune
beset
me
a
pull
would
have
landed
me
at
lewes
there
was
much
to
be
thankful
for
however
through
a
merciful
providence
it
was
my
privilege
to
enjoy
a
soft
bed
at
the
willow
grove
inn
and
not
a
cold
one
on
the
sands
of
slaughter
beach
so
ended
my
last
day

the

my
first
thought
the
next
morning
was
of
the
lost
outrigger
and
how
i
should
replace
it
my
host
soon
solved
the
problem
for
me
i
was
to
drive
to
the
scene
of
the
late
disaster
in
his
light
covered
wagon
load
it
with
the
canoe
and
cargo
and
take
the
shortest
route
to
love
creek
six
miles
from
lewes
stopping
on
the
way
at
a
blacksmith
for
a
new
outrigger
we
drove
over
sandy
roads
through
forests
of
pine
and
oak
to
the
village
of
milton
where
a
curious
crowd
gathered
round
us
and
facetiously
asked
if
we
had
brought
the
canoe
all
the
way
from
troy
in
that
wagon
the
village
smith
without
removing
the
paper
boat
from
her
snug
quarters
made
a
fair
outrigger
in
an
time
when
we
continued
our
monotonous
ride
through
the
dreary
woods
to
a
clearing
upon
the
banks
of
a
cedar
swamp
where
in
a
cottage
lived
george
webb
to
whom
bob
hazzle
my
driver
presented
me
having
now
reached
love
creek
i
deposited
my
canoe
with
webb
and
started
off
for
lewes
to
view
the
town
and
the
ocean
across
the
entrance
of
delaware
bay
from
cape
henlopen
light
to
cape
may
light
on
the
southern
end
of
new
jersey
is
a
distance
of
twelve
statute
miles
saturday
night
and
sunday
were
passed
in
lewes
which
is
situated
inside
of
cape
henlopen
and
behind
the
celebrated
stone
breakwater
which
was
constructed
by
the
government
this
port
of
refuge
is
much
frequented
by
coasters
as
many
as
two
or
three
hundred
sails
collecting
here
during
a
severe
gale
the
government
is
building
a
remarkable
pier
of
solid
iron
spiles
three
abreast
which
when
completed
will
run
out
seventeen
hundred
feet
into
the
bay
and
reach
a
depth
of
feet
of
water
captain
brown
of
the
engineers
was
in
charge
of
the
work
by
the
application
of
a
jet
of
water
forced
by
an
hydraulic
pump
through
a
tube
down
the
outside
of
the
spile
while
it
is
being
screwed
into
the
sand
a
puddling
of
the
same
is
kept
up
which
relieves
the
strain
upon
the
and
saves
of
the
time
and
labor
usually
expended
by
the
old
method
of
inserting
the
screw
spile
this
invention
was
a
happy
thought
of
captain
brown
the
government
has
purchased
a
piece
of
land
at
lewes
for
the
site
of
a
fort
some
time
in
the
future
there
will
be
a
railroad
terminating
on
the
pier
and
coal
will
be
brought
directly
from
the
mines
to
supply
the
fleets
which
will
gather
within
the
walls
of
the
breakwater
here
free
from
all
danger
of
an
ice
blockade
this
port
will
become
a
safe
and
convenient
harbor
and
coaling
station
during
the
winter
time
for
government
and
other
vessels
at
dusk
on
sunday
evening
the
collector
of
the
port
captain
lyons
and
his
friends
took
me
in
their
carriage
back
to
love
creek
where
webb
insisted
upon
making
me
the
recipient
of
his
hospitality
for
the
night
a
little
crowd
of
women
from
the
vicinity
of
the
swamp
were
awaiting
my
arrival
to
see
the
canoe
one
ancient
dame
catching
sight
of
the
which
i
took
from
my
clapped
her
thin
hands
and
enthusiastically
exclaimed
what
a
nice
thing
for
a
best
i
ever
seed
having
satisfied
the
curiosity
of
these
people
and
been
much
amused
by
their
quaint
remarks
i
was
quietly
smuggled
into
webb
best
room
where
if
my
spirit
did
not
make
feathery
flights
it
was
not
the
fault
of
the
downy
bed
in
whose
unfathomable
depths
i
now
lost
myself
before
leaving
delaware
i
feel
it
an
imperative
duty
to
the
public
to
refer
to
one
of
her
institutions
persons
unacquainted
with
the
fact
will
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
one
state
of
the
great
american
republic
still
holds
to
the
practice
of
lashing
men
and
women
white
and
black
delaware
one
of
the
smallest
states
of
the
union
the
citizens
of
which
are
proverbially
generous
and
hospitable
a
state
which
has
produced
a
bayard
is
to
her
shame
we
regret
to
say
the
culprit
which
sins
against
the
spirit
of
civilization
in
this
nineteenth
century
one
hundred
years
after
the
fathers
of
the
republic
declared
equal
rights
for
all
men
in
treating
of
so
delicate
a
subject
i
desire
to
do
no
one
injustice
therefore
i
will
let
a
native
of
delaware
speak
for
his
community
dover
delaware
august
editor
camden
spy
according
to
promise
i
now
write
you
a
little
about
delaware
persons
in
your
vicinity
look
upon
the
diamond
state
as
a
mere
bog
or
marsh
and
mud
and
water
they
suppose
are
its
chief
productions
but
in
my
opinion
it
is
one
of
the
finest
little
states
in
the
union
although
small
in
proportion
to
the
size
it
produces
more
grain
and
fruit
than
any
other
state
in
the
country
and
they
are
unexcelled
as
regards
quality
and
flavor
crime
is
kept
in
awe
by
that
best
of
institutions
the
whipping
post
and
pillory
these
are
the
bugbear
of
all
the
northern
newspapers
and
they
can
say
nothing
too
harsh
or
severe
against
them
the
in
kent
county
is
situated
in
the
yard
of
the
jail
and
is
about
six
feet
in
height
and
three
feet
in
circumference
the
prisoner
is
fastened
to
it
by
means
of
bracelets
or
arms
on
the
wrist
and
the
sheriff
executes
the
sentence
of
the
law
by
baring
the
convict
to
the
waist
and
on
the
bare
back
lashing
him
twenty
forty
or
sixty
times
according
to
the
sentence
but
the
blood
does
not
run
in
streams
from
the
prisoner
back
nor
is
he
thrown
into
a
barrel
of
brine
and
salt
sprinkled
over
the
lashes
on
the
contrary
i
have
seen
them
laugh
and
coolly
remark
that
good
exercise
and
gives
us
an
appetite
but
there
are
others
who
raise
the
devil
own
row
with
their
yells
and
horrible
cries
of
pain
the
whipping
is
public
and
is
witnessed
each
time
by
large
numbers
of
people
who
come
from
miles
around
to
see
the
culprit
disgraced
a
public
whipping
occurred
not
very
long
ago
and
the
day
was
very
stormy
yet
there
were
fully
three
hundred
spectators
on
the
ground
to
witness
this
wholesome
punishment
a
person
who
has
been
lashed
at
the
can
not
vote
again
in
this
state
thus
most
of
the
criminals
who
are
whipped
leave
the
state
in
order
to
regain
their
citizenship
the
newspapers
can
blow
until
they
are
tired
about
this
barbaric
and
unchristian
punishment
but
if
their
own
states
would
adopt
this
form
of
punishment
they
would
find
crime
continually
on
the
decrease
what
is
imprisonment
for
a
few
months
or
years
it
is
soon
over
with
and
then
they
are
again
let
out
upon
the
community
to
beg
borrow
and
steal
but
to
be
publicly
whipped
is
an
everlasting
disgrace
and
deters
men
from
committing
wrong
women
are
whipped
in
the
same
manner
and
they
take
it
very
hard
but
to
my
recollection
there
has
not
been
a
female
prisoner
for
some
time
i
did
not
intend
to
comment
so
long
upon
the
in
the
state
of
delaware
the
pillory
next
claims
our
attention
this
is
a
long
piece
of
board
that
runs
through
the
at
the
top
and
has
holes
as
per
engraving
for
the
neck
and
arms
to
rest
in
a
very
constrained
position
the
prisoner
is
compelled
to
stand
on
his
toes
for
an
hour
with
his
neck
and
arms
in
the
holes
and
if
he
sinks
from
exhaustion
as
it
sometimes
happens
the
neck
is
instantly
broken
josiah
ward
the
villain
who
escaped
punishment
for
the
murder
of
the
man
wady
in
your
county
came
into
delaware
broke
into
a
succeeded
in
stealing
one
pair
of
shoes
was
arrested
got
sixty
lashes
at
the
post
was
made
to
stand
in
the
pillory
one
hour
is
now
serving
out
a
term
of
two
imprisonment
and
he
never
got
the
shoes
the
pillory
is
certainly
a
terrible
and
cruel
punishment
and
while
i
heartily
favor
the
i
think
this
savage
punishment
should
be
abolished
since
writing
the
above
i
have
heard
that
a
colored
woman
was
convicted
of
murder
in
the
second
degree
last
may
and
on
saturday
the
of
that
month
received
sixty
lashes
on
her
bare
back
and
stood
in
the
pillory
one
hour
what
do
you
think
of
delaware
law
after
what
i
have
written
i
have
written
enough
for
the
present
so
i
will
close
ever
remaining
yours
very
truly
for
twenty
years
past
delaware
and
maryland
farmers
have
given
much
attention
to
peach
culture
which
has
gradually
declined
in
new
jersey
and
states
further
north
there
are
said
to
be
over
sixty
thousand
acres
of
land
on
the
peninsula
planted
with
which
are
estimated
to
be
worth
fifty
dollars
per
acre
or
three
million
dollars
to
harvest
this
crop
requires
at
least
thousand
men
women
and
children
the
planting
of
an
acre
of
and
its
cultivation
to
maturity
costs
from
thirty
to
forty
dollars
the
canners
take
a
large
portion
of
the
best
peaches
which
are
shipped
to
foreign
as
well
as
to
domestic
markets
the
low
lands
and
of
the
peninsula
exhale
malaria
which
attacks
the
inhabitants
in
a
mild
form
of
ague
during
the
spring
summer
and
early
fall
months
a
prudent
man
will
not
expose
himself
to
the
air
until
after
the
sun
has
risen
and
dispelled
the
mists
of
morning
the
same
caution
should
be
observed
all
through
the
low
regions
of
the
south
both
as
to
morning
and
evening
exercise
chills
and
fever
are
the
bane
of
the
southern
and
middle
states
as
this
disease
affects
the
health
and
elastic
vigor
of
the
constitution
and
also
produces
great
mental
depression
yet
those
who
suffer
even
on
every
alternate
day
from
chills
seem
to
accept
the
malaria
as
nothing
of
much
importance
though
it
is
a
fact
that
this
form
of
intermittent
fever
so
reduces
the
strength
that
the
system
is
unable
to
cope
with
other
and
more
dangerous
diseases
for
which
it
paves
the
way
upon
a
little
creek
tributary
to
river
and
near
its
confluence
with
the
isle
of
wight
bay
a
long
day
pull
from
the
swamp
of
love
creek
was
the
old
plantation
home
of
a
friend
of
my
boyhood
taylor
who
about
this
time
was
looking
out
for
the
arrival
of
the
paper
canoe
it
was
a
question
whether
i
could
descend
love
creek
three
miles
cross
rehoboth
and
indian
river
sounds
ascend
white

make
a
portage
to

light
cross

ascend
and
cross
martin
river
to
turval
creek
and
reach
the
home
of
my
friend
all
in
one
day
but
i
determined
to
attempt
the
task
webb
roused
his
family
at
an
early
hour
and
i
rowed
down
love
creek
and
crossed
the
shallow
waters
of
rehoboth
bay
in
the
early
part
of
the
day
from
cape
henlopen
following
the
general
contour
of
the
coast
to
cape
charles
at
the
northern
entrance
of
chesapeake
bay
is
a
distance
of
one
hundred
and
miles
from
cape

across
the
mouth
of
chesapeake
bay
to
cape
henry
is
thirteen
miles
from
henlopen
south
the
state
of
delaware
occupies
about
twenty
miles
of
the
coast
the
eastern
shore
of
maryland
holds
between
thirty
and
forty
miles
while
the
eastern
shore
of
virginia
represented
by
the
counties
of
accomac
and
northampton
covers
the
peninsula
to
cape
charles
commencing
at
rehoboth
bay
a
small
boat
may
follow
the
interior
waters
to
the
chesapeake
bay
the
watercourses
of
this
coast
are
protected
from
the
rough
waves
of
the
ocean
by
long
narrow
sandy
islands
known
as
beaches
between
which
the
tides
enter
these
passages
from
the
sea
to
the
interior
waters
are
called
inlets
and
most
of
them
are
navigable
for
coasting
vessels
of
light
draught
these
inlets
are
so
influenced
by
the
action
of
storms
and
their
shores
and
locations
are
so
changed
by
them
that
the
cattle
may
graze
in
tranquil
happiness
where
only
a
generation
ago
the
old
skipper
navigated
his
craft
during
june
of
the
year
a
fierce
gale
opened
sandy
point
inlet
with
a
foot
depth
of
water
but
it
closed
in
green
point
inlet
was
cut
through
the
beach
during
a
gale
in
and
was
closed
up
seven
years
later
old
sinepuxent
inlet
which
was
forced
open
by
the
sea
more
than
sixty
years
ago
closed
in
these
three
inlets
were
within
a
space
of
three
miles
and
were
all
north
of
chincoteague
village
green
run
inlet
which
had
a
depth
of
about
six
feet
of
water
for
nearly
ten
years
also
closed
after
shifting
half
a
mile
to
the
south
of
its
original
location
the
tendency
of
inlets
on
this
coast
is
to
shift
to
the
southward
as
do
the
inlets
on
the
coast
of
new
jersey
oystermen
fishermen
and
farmers
live
along
the
upland
and
in
some
cases
on
the
island
beaches
from
these
bays
timber
firewood
grain
and
oysters
are
shipped
to
northern
ports
the
people
are
everywhere
kind
and
hospitable
to
strangers
a
mild
climate
cheap
and
easily
worked
soils
shooting
fine
oysters
and
fishing
privileges
offer
inducements
to
northerners
and
europeans
to
settle
in
this
country
the
mild
form
of
ague
which
exists
in
most
of
its
localities
being
the
only
objection
while
debating
this
point
with
a
native
he
attacked
my
argument
by
saying
law
sakes
do
folks
die
of
something
any
way
if
you

sight
wuss

sich
as
cumsempsun
mental
spinageetis
and
all
sorts
of

besides
you
have
such
awful
cold
winters
that
a
farmer
has
to
stay
holed
four
months
out
of
the
year
while
we
folks
in
the
south
can
work
most
of
the
time
out
of
doors
i
be
if
i
had
ruther
live
here
in
poverty
than
die
up
north
in
riches
now
stranger
as
to
what
you
said
about
sickness
why
we
are
no
circumstance
to
you
fellows
up
north
why
your
hull
country
is
chuckfull
of
pizenous
remedies
when
i
was
along
yankeedom
and
went
ashore
i
found
all
the
rocks
along
the
road
were
jist
kivered
with
notices
and
all
the
farmers
hired
out
the
outsides
of
their
barns
to
advertise
doctor
stuff
on
in
no
portion
of
america
do
the
people
seem
to
feel
the
burden
of
earning
a
livelihood
more
lightly
they
get
a
great
deal
of
social
enjoyment
out
of
life
at
very
little
cost
and
place
much
less
value
on
the
mighty
dollar
than
do
their
brother
farmers
of
the
northern
section
of
the
states
the
interesting
inquiry
of
who
was
his
father
commences
at
philadelphia
and
its
importance
intensifies
as
you
travel
southward
old
family
associations
have
great
weight
among
all
classes
it
was
six
miles
from
the
mouth
of
love
creek
across
the
little
sound
to
burton
marshy
island
at
the
entrance
of
indian
river
sound
indian
river
supplies
its
bay
with
much
of
its
fresh
water
and
the
small
inlet
in
the
beach
of
the
same
name
with
the
salt
water
of
the
ocean
large
flocks
of
geese
and
ducks
were
seen
upon
the
quiet
waters
of
the
sound
pursuing
my
southward
course
across
indian
river
sound
three
miles
i
entered
a
small
creek
with
a
wide
mouth
which
flows
north
from
the
cedar
swamp
known
as
white
creek
which
i
ascended
until
the
stream
became
so
narrow
that
it
seemed
almost
lost
in
the
wilderness
when
suddenly
an
opening
in
the
forest
showed
me
a
clearing
with
the
little
buildings
of
a
farm
scattered
around
it
was
the
home
of
a
methodist
exhorter
silas
betts
i
told
him
how
anxious
i
was
to
make
a
quick
portage
to
the
nearest
southern
water
little
assawaman
bay
not
much
more
than
three
miles
distant
by
road
after
calmly
examining
my
boat
he
said
it
is
now
eleven
wife
has
dinner
about
ready
i
hurry
her
up
a
little
and
while
she
is
putting
it
on
the
table
we
will
get
the
cart
ready
the
cart
was
soon
loaded
with
pine
needles
as
a
bed
for
the
canoe
we
lashed
her
into
a
firm
position
with
cords
and
went
in
to
dinner
in
a
short
time
after
we
were
rattling
over
a
level
wooded
country
diversified
here
and
there
by
a
little
farm
the
shallow
bay
the
east
side
of
which
was
separated
from
the
ocean
by
sandy
hills
was
bounded
by
marshes
we
drove
close
to
the
water
and
put
the
maria
theresa
once
more
into
her
true
element
a
friendly
shake
of
the
hand
as
i
paid
the
conscientious
man
his
charge
of
one
dollar
for
his
services
with
many
thanks
for
his
hospitality
for
which
he
would
accept
nothing
and
the
canoe
was
off
threading
the
narrow
and
very
shallow
of
this
bay
the
tall
tower
of
fenwick
island
light
located
on
the
boundary
line
of
delaware
and
maryland
was
now
my
landmark
it
rises
out
of
the
low
land
that
forms
a
barrier
against
which
the
sea
breaks
the
people
on
the
coast
pronounce
fenwick
phoenix
phoenix
island
they
say
was
once
a
part
of
the
mainland
but
a
woman
wishing
to
keep
her
cattle
from
straying
gave
a
man
a
shirt
for
digging
a
narrow
ditch
between
little
and
great
assawaman
bays
the
tide
ebbed
and
flowed
so
strongly
through
this
new
that
it
was
worn
to
more
than
a
hundred
feet
in
width
and
has
at
high
tide
a
depth
in
places
of
from
ten
to
fifteen
feet
of
water
the
opening
of
this
new
thoroughfare
so
diminished
the
flow
of
water
through
the
little
assawaman
inlet
to
the
sea
that
it
became
closed
the
water
was
almost
fresh
here
as
the
nearest
inlet
which
admits
salt
water
at
high
tide
is
at
chincoteague
island
some
fifty
miles
distant
passing
to
the
west
of
the
through
this
passage
i
thought
of
what
a
woman
could
do
and
almost
expected
to
hear
from
the
rippling
waters
the
song
of
the
shirt
which
would
have
been
in
this
case
a
much
more
cheerful
one
than
hood
i
now
entered
great
assawaman
bay
the
waters
of
which
lay
like
a
mirror
before
me
and
nearly
five
miles
away
to
the
southwestern
end
the
tall
forests
of
the
isle
of
wight
loomed
up
against
the
setting
sun
ducks
rose
in
flocks
from
the
quiet
waters
as
my
canoe
glided
into
their
close
vicinity
if
i
could
have
taken
less
cargo
i
should
have
carried
a
light
gun
but
this
being
impossible
a
pocket
revolver
was
my
only
so
the
ducks
and
other
along
my
route
had
reason
to
hold
the
paper
canoe
in
grateful
remembrance
upon
reaching
the
shores
of
the
isle
of
wight
i
entered
the
mouth
of
martin
river
which
is
at
its
confluence
with
isle
of
wight
bay
more
than
two
miles
wide
i
did
not
then
possess
the
fine
coast
chart
or
the
general
chart
of
the
coast
with
the
topography
of
the
land
clearly
delineated
and
showing
every
fields
landings
so
plainly
located
as
to
make
it
easy
for
even
a
novice
to
navigate
these
bays
now
being
chartless
so
far
as
these
waters
were
concerned
i
peered
about
in
the
deepening
twilight
for
my
plantation
buildings
which
i
knew
were
not
far
off
but
the
gloomy
forests
of
pine
upon
the
upland
opened
not
the
desired
vista
i
so
longed
to
find
crossing
the
wide
river
i
came
upon
a
long
point
of
which
i
hoped
might
be
keyser
point
for
i
knew
that
to
the
west
of
this
point
i
should
find
turval
creek
while
rowing
along
the
marsh
i
came
upon
two
in
their
punt
but
so
enveloped
were
they
in
the
mist
that
it
was
impossible
to
do
more
than
define
their
forms
i
however
ventured
a
question
as
to
my
locality
when
to
my
utter
astonishment
there
came
back
to
me
in
clear
accents
my
own
name
never
before
had
it
sounded
so
sweet
to
my
ears
it
was
the
voice
of
my
friend
who
with
a
companion
was
occupied
in
removing
from
the
water
the
flock
of
decoys
which
they
had
been
guarding
since
sunrise
joyful
was
the
unexpected
meeting
we
rowed
around
keyser
point
and
up
turval
creek
a
couple
of
miles
to
the
plantation
landing
there
upon
the
old
estate
in
the
little
family
slept
each
in
his
narrow
cell
the
children
of
four
generations
our
conversation
before
the
blazing
that
night
related
to
the
ground
travelled
over
during
the
day
a
course
of
about
miles
father
mentioned
that
a
friend
during
one
week
in
the
previous
september
had
taken
upon
his
hook
while
fishing
from
the
marshes
of
rehoboth
bay
five
hundred
some
of
which
weighed
twenty
pounds
the
oysters
in
rehoboth
and
indian
river
bays
had
died
out
probably
from
the
decrease
in
the
amount
of
salt
water
now
entering
them
a
delightful
week
was
spent
with
my
friends
at
winchester
plantation
when
the
falling
of
the
mercury
warned
me
to
hurry
southward
on
wednesday
november
i
descended
the
plantation
creek
and
rowed
out
of
martin
river
into
the
bay
my
course
southward
led
me
past
the
hommack
an
indian
mound
of
which
rises
about
seven
feet
above
the
marsh
on
the
west
side
of
the
entrance
to
sinepuxent
bay
and
where
the
mainland
approaches
to
within
eight
hundred
feet
of
the
beach
this
point
which
divides
the
isle
of

bay
from
sinepuxent
is
the
terminus
of
the
wicomico

which
has
been
extended
from
berlin
eastwardly
seven

a
short
ferry
conveys
the
passengers
across
the
water
to
a
narrow

is
considered
by
bayard
taylor
the
author
the
finest
beach

has
ever
visited

and
the
most
prized
of
the
two
the
average
width
of
sinepuxent
was
only
a
mile
when
i
turned
westwardly
around
south

and
entered

the
watery
expanse
widened
between
the

wide
i
ascended
it
in
the
afternoon
to
visit
purnell
whose
attempts
to
introduce
the
pinnated
grouse
and
california
partridges
on
his
plantation
had
attracted
the
attention
of
charles
hallock
editor
of
forest
and
stream
and
i
had
promised
him
if
possible
to
investigate
the
matter
this
south
point
of
sinepuxent
neck
is
a
place
of
historical
interest
it
being
now
asserted
that
it
is
the
burial
place
of
edward
whalley
the
regicide
early
in
robert
robins
found
in
a
bundle
of
old
family
documents
a
paper
containing
interesting
statements
written
by
his
thomas
robins
of
south
point
worcester
county
maryland
and
dated
july
we
gather
from
this
reliable
source
that
edward
whalley
left
connecticut
and
arrived
in
virginia
in
and
was
there
met
by
a
portion
of
his
family
from
virginia
he
travelled
to
the
province
of
maryland
and
settled
first
at
ye
mouth
of
ye
pokemoke
river
and
finding
yt
too
publick
a
place
he
came
to
sinepuxent
a
neck
of
land
open
to
ye
atlantic
ocean
where
colonel
stephen
was
surveying
and
bought
a
tract
of
land
from
him
and
called
it
genezar
it
contained
two
thousand
two
hundred
acres
south
end
of
sinepuxent
and
made
a
settlement
on
ye
southern
extremity
and
called
it
south
point
to
ye
which
place
he
brought
his
family
about
in
ye
name
of
edward
middleton
his
own
name
he
made
not
publick
until
after
this
date
after
ye
revolution
in
england
in
ye
year
of
our
lord
when
he
let
his
name
be
seen
in
publick
papers
and
had
ye
lands
patented
in
his
own
name
the
writer
of
the
above
quotation
was
the
of
edward
whalley
alias
edward
middleton
the
celebrated
regicide
four
miles
from
south
point
i
struck
the
marshes
which
skirted
purnell
large
plantation
and
pushing
the
canoe
up
a
narrow
branch
of
the
creek
i
waded
through
the
partially
submerged
herbage
to
the
firm
ground
where
the
doctor
was
awaiting
me
his
house
was
close
at
hand
within
the
hospitable
walls
of
which
i
passed
the
night
purnell
has
an
estate
of
one
thousand
five
hundred
acres
lying
along
the
banks
of
newport
creek
since
the
civil
war
it
has
been
worked
by
tenants
much
of
it
is
woodland
and
five
years
before
my
visit
a
philadelphian
sent
the
doctor
a
few
pairs
of
and
a
covey
of
both
the
valley
and
the
mountain
partridge
i
am
now
using
popular
terms
the
grouse
were
from
a
western
state
the
partridges
had
been
obtained
from
california
the
partridges
were
kept
caged
for
several
weeks
and
were
then
set
at
liberty
they
soon
disappeared
in
the
woods
with
the
exception
of
a
single
pair
which
returned
daily
to
the
of
a
farm
tenant
to
obtain
food
these
two
birds
nested
in
the
garden
close
to
the
house
and
reared
a
fine
brood
of
young
but
the
whole
covey
wandered
away
and
were
afterwards
heard
from
but
once
they
had
crossed
to
the
opposite
side
of
newport
creek
and
were
probably
shot
by
gunners
the
adapted
themselves
to
their
new
home
in
a
satisfactory
manner
and
became
very
tame
their
nests
well
filled
with
eggs
were
found
along
the
of
the
fields
in
the
close
vicinity
of
the
marshes
for
which
level
tracts
they
seemed
to
have
strong
attachment
they
multiplied
rapidly
and
visited
the
and
of
the
plantation
the
maryland
legislature
passed
a
law
to
protect
all
grouse
introduced
into
the
state
but
a
new
danger
threatened
these
unfortunate
birds
a
crew
of
new
jersey
entered
chincoteague
inlet
and
searched
the
ditches
and
little
creeks
of
the
for
the
diamondbacks
while
thus
engaged
the
gentle
grouse
feeding
quietly
in
the
vicinity
attracted
their
attention
and
they
at
once
bagged
most
of
them
a
tenant
on
the
estate
informed
me
that
he
had
seen
eighteen
birds
in
a
cornfield
a
few
days
before
the
remnant
of
the
stock
the

is
only
an
accidental
visitor
in
the
new
england
states
indeed
as
far
south
as
ocean
county
new
jersey
i
saw
but
one
of
these
birds
in
a
residence
of
nine
years
on
my
cranberry
plantations
though
i
have
heard
that
their
nests
are
occasionally
found
about
cape
may
at
the
extreme
southern
end
of
new
jersey
my
time
being
limited
i
could
enjoy
the
doctor
hospitality
for
but
one
night
the
next
morning
the
whole
family
with
tenants
both
black
and
white
assisted
me
to
embark
by
dusk
i
had
crossed
the
division
line
of
two
states
and
had
entered
virginia
near
the
head
of
chincoteague
island
a
locality
of
peculiar
interest
to
the
student
of
american
character
the
had
left
but
little
water
around
the
rough
pier
abreast
of
the
town
and
heaps
of
rose
from
the
mud
flats
and
threatened
the
safety
of
my
canoe
i
looked
up
through
the
darkness
to
the
light
above
me
and
called
for
assistance
two
men
leaned
over
to
inquire
what
the
row
now
stranger
to
which
i
replied
i
wish
to
land
a
light
boat
on
your
pier
and
as
it
is
made
of
paper
it
should
be
carefully
handled
for
a
moment
the
oystermen
observed
a
silence
and
then
without
one
word
of
explanation
disappeared
i
heard
their
heavy
boots
tramping
up
the
quay
towards
the
tavern
soon
a
low
murmur
arose
on
the
night
air
then
hoarse
shouts
and
there
came
thundering
down
the
wharf
an
army
of
men
and
boys
pass
her
up
stranger
they
cried
here
give
us
your
bow
and
starn
painters
and
jest
step
overboard
yourself
and
we
hist
her
up
some
of
the
motley
crew
caught
me
by
the
shoulders
others
histed
away
and
the
canoe
and
its
captain
were
laid
roughly
upon
the
ground
there
was
a
rush
to
feel
of
the
paper
shell
many
were
convinced
that
there
was
no
humbug
about
it
so
with
a
great
shout
some
of
the
men
tossed
it
upon
their
shoulders
while
the
rest
seized
upon
the
miscellaneous
cargo
and
a
rush
was
made
for
the
hotel
leaving
me
to
follow
at
discretion
and
alone
the
procession
burst
open
the
doors
of
the
tavern
and
poured
through
the
entrance
to
a
where
they
laid
the
boat
upon
a
long
table
under
a
shed
and
thought
they
had
earned
drinks
this
was
the
spontaneous
way
in
which
the
chincoteague
people
welcomed
me
if
you
do
drink
stranger
up
your
way
what
on
airth
keeps
your
buddies
and
soulds
together
queried
a
tall
oysterman
a
lady
had
kindly
presented
me
with
a
peck
of
fine
apples
that
very
morning
so
in
lieu
of
drinks
i
distributed
the
fruit
among
them
they
joked
and
questioned
me
and
all
were
merry
save
one
individual
not
dressed
like
the
others
in
an
oysterman
garb
but
wearing
to
use
a
term
of
the
place
store
clothes
after
the
crowd
had
settled
in
the
at
cards
this
doubting
thomas
remained
beside
the
boat
carefully
examining
her
soon
he
was
scraping
her
hull
below
the
gunwale
where
the
muddy
water
of
the
bay
had
left
a
thin
coat
of
sediment
which
was
now
dry
the
man
countenance
lighted
up
as
he
pulled
the
bartender
aside
and
said
look
ahere
i
tell
you
that
boat
looked
as
if
she
was
made
to
carry
on
a
deck
of
a
vessel
and
to
be
off
into
the
water
at
night
jest
abreast
of
a
town
to
make
fools
of
folks
and
git
them
to
believe
that
that
fellow
had
all
the
way
ahere
now
see
here
is
dust
dry
dust
on
her
hull
she
ahai
ben
in
the
water
ten
minutes
i
sware
it
required
but
a
investigation
of
my
chincoteague
audience
to
discover
that
the
dust
was
mud
from
the
tide
and
the
doubter
brought
down
the
ridicule
of
his
more
discriminating
neighbors
upon
him
and
slunk
away
amid
their
jeers
of
all
this
community
of
watermen
but
one
could
be
found
that
night
who
had
threaded
the
interior
watercourses
as
far
as
cape
charles
and
he
was
the
youngest
of
the
lot
taking
out
my
i
jotted
down
his
amusing
directions
look
out
for
cat
creek
below
four
mouths
he
said
you
catch
it
round
there
yes
broke
in
several
voices
cat
creek
an
awful
place
unless
you
run
through
on
a
full
oyster
boats
always
has
a
time
through
cat
creek
after
the
council
with
my
chincoteague
friends
had
ended
the
route
to
be
travelled
the
next
day
was
in
my
mental
vision
as
clear
as
mud
the
inhabitants
of
this
island
are
not
all
oystermen
for
many
find
occupation
and
profit
in
raising
ponies
upon
the
beach
of
assateague
where
the
wild
coarse
grass
furnishes
them
a
livelihood
these
hardy
little
animals
are
called
marsh
tackies
and
are
found
at
intervals
along
the
beaches
down
to
the
of
the
carolinas
they
hold
at
chincoteague
an
annual
fair
to
which
all
the
as
they
are
called
bring
their
surplus
animals
to
sell
the
average
price
is
about
ninety
dollars
for
a
good
beast
though
some
have
sold
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
all
these
horses
are
sold
in
a
and
unbroken
state
the
following
morning
caulk
of
the
oyster
port
and
about
fifty
persons
escorted
me
to
the
landing
and
sent
me
away
with
a
hearty
good
luck
to
ye
it
was
three
miles
and
three
quarters
to
the
southern
end
of
the
island
which
has
an
inlet
from
the
ocean
upon
each
side
of
that
end
the
northern
one
being
assateague
the
southern
one
chincoteague
inlet
fortunately
i
crossed
the
latter
in
smooth
water
to
ballast
narrows
in
the
marshes
and
soon
reached
four
mouths
where
i
found
five
mouths
of
thoroughfares
and
became
perplexed
for
had
not
the
pilots
of
chincoteague
called
this
interesting
display
of
mouths
four
mouths
i
clung
to
the
authority
of
local
knowledge
however
and
was
soon
in
a
labyrinth
of
creeks
which
ended
in
the
marshes
near
the
beach
returning
over
the
course
i
once
more
faced
the
four
or
five
mouths
rather
and
taking
a
new
departure
by
entering
the
next
mouth
to
the
one
i
had
so
unsatisfactorily
explored
soon
entered
rogue
bay
across
which
could
be
seen
the
entrance
to
cat
creek
where
i
was
to
experience
the
difficulties
predicted
by
my
chincoteague
friends
cat
creek
furnished
at
half
tide
sufficient
water
for
my
canoe
and
not
the
slightest
difficulty
was
experienced
in
getting
through
it
the
oystermen
had
in
their
minds
their
own
when
they
discoursed
to
me
about
the
hard
passage
of
cat
creek
they
had
not
considered
the
fact
that
my
craft
drew
only
five
inches
of
water
cat
creek
took
me
quite
down
to
the
beach
where
through
an
inlet
the
ocean
sparkling
in
its
white
caps
came
pleasantly
into
view
another
inlet
was
to
be
crossed
and
again
i
was
favored
with
smooth
water
this
was
assawaman
inlet
which
divided
the
beach
into
two
islands
wallops
on
the
north
and
assawaman
on
the
south
it
seemed
a
singular
fact
that
the
two
assawaman
bays
are
miles
to
the
north
of
an
inlet
of
the
same
name
in
following
the
creeks
through
the
marshes
between
assawaman
island
and
the
mainland
i
crossed
another
shoal
bay
and
another
inlet
opened
in
the
beach
through
which
the
ocean
was
again
seen
this
last
was
gargathy
inlet
before
reaching
it
as
night
was
coming
on
i
turned
up
a
thoroughfare
and
rowed
some
distance
to
the
mainland
where
i
found
lodgings
with
a
hospitable
farmer
martin
kelly
at
daybreak
i
crossed
gargathy
inlet
it
was
now
saturday
november
and
being
encouraged
by
the
successful
crossing
of
the
inlets
in
my
tiny
craft
i
pushed
on
to
try
the
less
inviting
one
at
the
end
of
matomkin
island
fine
weather
favored
me
and
i
pushed
across
the
strong
tide
that
swept
through
this
inlet
without
shipping
a
sea
assawaman
and
gargathy
are
constantly
shifting
their
channels
at
times
there
will
be
six
feet
of
water
and
again
they
will
shoal
to
two
feet
matomkin
also
is
not
to
be
relied
on
every
northeaster
will
shift
a
buoy
placed
in
the
channels
of
these
three
inlets
so
they
are
not
buoyed
watchapreague
inlet
to
the
south
of
the
three
last
named
is
less
changeable
in
character
and
is
also
a
much
more
dangerous
inlet
to
cross
in
rough
weather
from
matoinkin
inlet
the
interior
thoroughfares
were
followed
inside
of
cedar
island
when
darkness
forced
me
to
seek
shelter
with
captain
william
burton
whose
comfortable
home
was
on
the
shore
of
the
mainland
about
five
miles
from
watchapreague
inlet
here
i
was
kindly
invited
to
spend
sunday
captain
burton
told
me
much
of
interest
and
among
other
things
mentioned
the
fact
that
during
one
august
a
few
years
before
my
visit
a
large
lobster
was
taken
on
a
in
watchapreague
inlet
and
that
a
smaller
one
was
captured
in
the
same
manner
during
the
summer
of
monday
was
a
gusty
day
my
canoe
scraped
its
keel
upon
the
shoals
as
i
dodged
the
broken
oyster
reefs
called
here
oyster
rocks
while
on
the
passage
down
to
watchapreague
inlet
the
tide
was
very
low
but
the
water
deepened
as
the
beach
was
approached
a
northeaster
was
blowing
freshly
and
i
was
looking
for
a
lee
under
the
beach
when
suddenly
the
canoe
shot
around
a
sandy
point
and
was
tugging
for
life
in
the
rough
waters
of
the
inlet
the
tide
was
running
in
from
the
sea
with
the
force
of
a
rapid
and
the
short
quick
puffs
of
wind
tossed
the
waves
wildly
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
turn
the
canoe
back
to
the
beach
in
such
rough
water
but
intent
on
keeping
the
boat
above
the
caps
i
gave
her
all
the
momentum
that
muscular
power
could
exert
as
she
was
headed
for
the
southern
point
of
the
beach
across
the
dangerous
inlet
though
it
was
only
half
a
mile
across
the
passage
of
watchapreague
taxed
me
severely
waves
washed
over
my
canoe
but
the
gallant
little
craft
after
each
rebuff
rose
like
a
bird
to
the
surface
of
the
water
answering
the
slightest
touch
of
my
oar
better
than
the
steed
after
entering
the
swash
the
wind
struck
me
on
the
back
and
seas
came
tumbling
over
and
around
the
boat
fairly
forcing
me
on
to
the
beach
as
we
flew
along
the
tumultuous
waters
made
my
head
swim
so
to
prevent
mental
confusion
i
kept
my
eyes
only
upon
the
oars
which
strange
to
say
never
betrayed
me
into
a
false
stroke
as
a
heavy
blast
beat
down
the
raging
sea
for
a
moment
i
looked
over
my
shoulder
and
beheld
the
low
sandy
dunes
of
the
southern
shore
of
the
inlet
close
at
hand
and
with
a
severe
jolt
the
canoe
grounded
high
on
the
strand
i
leaped
out
and
drew
my
precious
craft
away
from
the
tide
breathing
a
prayer
of
thankfulness
for
my
escape
from
danger
and
mentally
vowing
that
the
canoe
should
cross
all
other
treacherous
inlets
in
a
fisherman
sloop
i
went
into
camp
in
a
hollow
of
the
beach
where
the
protected
me
from
the
piercing
wind
all
that
afternoon
i
watched
from
my
burrow
in
the
ground
the
raging
of
the
elements
and
towards
evening
was
pleased
to
note
a
general
subsidence
of
wind
and
sea
the
canoe
was
again
put
into
the
water
and
the
thoroughfare
followed
southward
for
a
mile
or
two
when
the
short
day
ended
leaving
me
beside
a
marshy
island
which
was
fringed
with
an
of
bivalves
stepping
overboard
in
the
mud
and
water
the
oars
and
paddle
were
laid
upon
the
shell
reef
to
protect
the
canoe
which
was
dragged
on
to
the
marsh
it
grew
colder
as
the
wind
died
out
the
marsh
was
wet
and
no
could
be
found
the
canvas
cover
was
removed
the
cargo
was
piled
up
on
a
platform
of
oars
and
shells
to
secure
it
from
the
next
tide
and
then
i
slowly
and
laboriously
packed
myself
away
in
the
narrow
shell
for
the
night
the
canvas
was
buttoned
in
its
place
a
rubber
blanket
covered
the
cockpit
and
i
tried
to
sleep
and
dream
that
i
was
not
a
sardine
nor
securely
confined
in
some
inhospitable
vault
it
was
impossible
to
turn
over
without
unbuttoning
one
side
of
the
and
going
through
contortions
that
would
have
done
credit
to
a
acrobat
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
found
it
necessary
to
get
out
of
bed
in
order
to
turn
over
in
it
at
midnight
mallards
anas
boschas
came
close
to
the
marsh
the
soft
whagh
of
the
drake
which
is
not
in
this
species
blessed
with
the
loud
quack
of
the
female
bird
sufficiently
established
the
identity
of
the
duck
then
muskrats
and
the
coon
came
round
no
doubt
scenting
my
provisions
brisk
raps
from
my
knuckles
on
the
inside
shell
of
the
canoe
astonished
these
animals
and
aroused
their
curiosity
for
they
annoyed
me
until
daybreak
when
i
emerged
from
my
narrow
bed
the
frosty
air
struck
my
cheeks
and
the
cold
wet
marsh
chilled
my
feet
it
was
the
delay
at
watchapreague
inlet
that
had
lodged
me
on
this
inhospitable
marsh
so
trying
to
exercise
my
poor
stock
of
patience
i
completed
my
toilet
shaking
in
my
wet
shoes
the
icy
water
into
which
i
stepped
in
order
to
launch
my
canoe
reminded
me
that
this
wintry
morning
was
in
fact
the
first
day
of
december
and
that
stormy
hatteras
south
of
which
was
to
be
found
a
milder
climate
was
still
a
long
way
off
the
brisk
row
along
paramore
island
called
palmer
by
the
natives
to
the
wide
entrance
of
little
machipongo
inlet
restored
warmth
to
my
benumbed
limbs
this
wide
doorway
of
the
ocean
permitted
me
to
cross
its
west
portal
in
peace
for
the
day
was
calm
from
little
to
great
machipongo
inlet
the
beach
is
called
hog
island
the
inside
thoroughfare
is
bounded
on
the
west
by
island
out
of
the
flats
of
which
rose
a
solitary
house
at
the
southern
end
of
hog
island
there
is
a
small
store
on
a
creek
and
near
the
beach
a
while
a
little
inland
is
located
within
a
forest
of
pines
a
small
settlement
at
noon
great
machipongo
inlet
was
crossed
without
danger
and
cobb
island
was
skirted
several
miles
to
sand
shoal
inlet
near
which
the
hotel
of
the
three
cobb
brothers
rose
cheerfully
out
of
the
dreary
waste
of
sands
and
marshes
the
father
of
the
present
proprietors
came
to
this
island
more
than
thirty
years
ago
and
took
possession
of
this
domain
which
had
been
thrown
up
by
the
action
of
the
waves
he
refused
an
offer
of
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
for
the
island
the
locality
is
one
of
the
best
on
this
coast
for
shooting
sand
shoal
inlet
at
the
southern
end
of
cobb
island
has
a
depth
of
twelve
feet
of
water
on
its
bar
at
low
tide
in
company
with
the
regular
ferry
i
crossed
the
next
day
the
broad
bay
to
the
mainland
eight
miles
distant
where
the
canoe
was
put
upon
a
cart
and
taken
across
the
peninsula
five
miles
to
cherrystone
the
only
point
near
cape
charles
at
which
a
norfolk
steamer
stopped
for
passengers
it
was
fully
forty
miles
across
chesapeake
bay
from
cherrystone
landing
to
norfolk
and
it
was
imperative
to
make
the
portage
from
this
place
instead
of
from
cape
charles
which
though
more
than
fifteen
miles
further
south
and
nearer
to
my
on
the
other
side
did
not
possess
facilities
for
transportation
the
slow
conveyance
arrived
at
cherrystone
half
an
hour
after
the
steamer
banks
had
left
the
landing
though
i
heard
that
the
captain
being
told
i
was
coming
waited
and
whistled
for
me
till
his
patience
was
exhausted
the
only
house
at
the
head
of
the
pier
was
owned
by
powers
and
fortunately
offered
hotel
accommodations
here
i
remained
until
the
next
trip
of
the
boat
december
arriving
in
norfolk
at
dusk
of
the
same
day
i
stored
my
canoe
in
the
warehouse
of
the
old
dominion
steamship
company
and
quietly
retired
to
a
hotel
which
promised
an
early
meal
in
the
morning
congratulating
myself
the
while
that
i
had
avoided
the
usual
show
of
curiosity
tendered
to
canoeists
at
city
piers
and
above
all
had
escaped
the
inevitable
reporter
alas
my
thankfulness
came
too
soon
for
when
about
to
retire
my
name
was
called
and
a
veritable
reporter
from
the
norfolk
landmark
cut
off
my
retreat
only
a
few
words
he
pleadingly
whispered
i
been
hunting
for
you
all
over
the
city
since
seven
and
it
is
near
midnight
now
he
gently
took
my
arm
and
politely
furnished
me
with
a
chair
then
placing
his
own
directly
before
me
he
insinuatingly
worked
upon
me
until
he
derived
a
knowledge
of
the
log
of
the
paper
canoe
when
leaning
back
in
his
chair
he
leisurely
surveyed
me
and
exclaimed
bishop
you
are
a
man
of
snap
we
like
men
of
snap
we
admire
men
of
snap
in
fact
i
may
say
we
cotton
to
men
of
snap
and
i
am
proud
to
make
your
acquaintance
now
if
you
will
stop
over
a
day
we
will
have
the
whole
city
out
to
see
your
boat
this
kind
offer
i
firmly
refused
and
we
were
about
to
part
when
he
said
in
a
softly
rebuking
manner
you
thought
bishop
you
would
give
us
the
slip
did
you
not
i
assure
you
that
would
be
quite
impossible
eternal
vigilance
is
our
motto
no
you
could
not
escape
us
good
evening
sir
and
the
welcome
to
you
six
hours

so
much
for
the

of

i
left
the
pier
of
the
old
dominion
steamship
company
at
norfolk
virginia
and
rowing
across
the
water
towards
portsmouth
commenced
ascending
elizabeth
river
which
is
here
wide
and
affected
by
tidal
change
the
old
navy
yard
with
its
dismantled
hulks
lying
at
anchor
in
the
stream
occupies
both
banks
of
the
river
about
six
miles
from
norfolk
the
entrance
to
the
dismal
swamp
canal
is
reached
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
this
old
canal
runs
through
the
great
dismal
swamp
and
affords
passage
for
steamers
and
vessels
to
elizabeth
city
on
the
pasquotank
river
which
empties
into
albemarle
sound
to
the
southward
the
great
cypress
and
juniper
timber
is
penetrated
by
this
canal
and
schooners
are
towed
into
the
swamp
to
landings
where
their
cargoes
are
delivered
in
the
interior
of
the
dismal

is
drummond
lake
named
after
its
discoverer
it
is
seven
miles
long
by
five
miles
wide
and
is
the
feeder
of
the
canal
a
branch
canal
connects
it
with
the
main

and
small

may
traverse
the

voyagers
tell
me
that
during
heavy
gales
of

a
terrible
sea
is
set
in
motion
upon
this
shoal
sheet
of
water
making
it
dangerous
to
navigate
bears
are
found
in
the
fastnesses
of
the
swamp
the
dismal
swamp
canal
was
dug
in
the
old
days
of
the
wheelbarrow
and
spade
the
albemarle
and
chesapeake
canal
the
entrance
to
which
is
sixteen
miles
from
norfolk
on
the
right
or
east
bank
of
the
elizabeth
river
and
generally
known
as
the
new
canal
was
commenced
about
the
year
and
finished
in
it
is
eight
miles
and
a
half
in
length
and
connects
the
elizabeth
and
north
landing
rivers
this
canal
was
dug
by
it
is
kept
in
a
much
better
state
for
navigation
so
far
as
the
depth
of
water
is
concerned
than
the
old
canal
which
from
inattention
is
gradually
shoaling
in
places
consequently
the
regular
which
ply
between
elizabeth
city
and
norfolk
as
well
as
steamers
whose
destinations
are
further
north
have
given
up
the
use
of
the
dismal
swamp
canal
and
now
go
round
through
albemarle
sound
up
the
north
river
thence
by
a
cut
into
currituck
sound
up
north
landing
river
and
through
the
new
canal
to
the
elizabeth
river
and
into
chesapeake
bay
the
shores
of
the
elizabeth
are
low
and
are
fringed
by
sedgy
marshes
while
forests
of
pine
present
a
green
background
to
the
eye
a
few
miles
above
norfolk
the
cultivation
of
land
ceases
and
the
canoeist
traverses
a
wilderness
about
noon
i
arrived
at
the
locks
of
the
albemarle
and
chesapeake
canal
the
telegraph
operator
greeted
me
with
the
news
that
the
company
agent
in
norfolk
had
telegraphed
to
the
to
pass
the
paper
canoe
through
with
the
freedom
of
the
canal
the
first
honor
of
the
kind
that
had
fallen
to
my
lot
the
tide
rises
and
falls
at
the
locks
in
the
river
about
three
feet
and
a
half
when
i
passed
through
the
difference
in
the
level
between
the
ends
of
the
locks
did
not
reach
two
feet
the
old
urged
me
to
give
up
the
journey
at
once
as
i
never
could
get
through
the
sounds
with
that
little
boat
when
i
told
him
i
was
on
my
second
thousand
miles
of
canoe
navigation
since
leaving
quebec
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
gave
a
low
groan
when
once
through
the
you
are
in
a
heavy
cypress
swamp
the
dredgings
thrown
upon
the
banks
have
raised
the
edge
of
the
swamp
to
seven
feet
above
the
water
little
pines
grow
along
these
shores
and
among
them
the
small
birds
now
on
their
southern
migrations
sported
and
sang
whenever
a
steamer
or
tugboat
passed
me
it
crowded
the
canoe
close
to
the
bank
but
these
vessels
travel
along
the
canal
at
so
slow
a
rate
that
no
trouble
is
experienced
by
the
canoeist
from
the
disturbance
caused
by
their
revolving
screws
freedmen
poling
flats
loaded
with
shingles
or
frame
stuff
roared
out
their
merry
songs
as
they
passed
the
canal
entered
the
north
landing
river
without
any
lockage
just
beyond
was
north
landing
from
which
the
river
takes
its
name
a
store
and
evidences
of
a
settlement
meet
the
eye
at
a
little
distance
the
river
is
tortuous
and
soon
leaves
the
swamp
behind
the
pine
forest
is
succeeded
by
marshes
on
both
sides
of
the
current
three
miles
from
north
landing
a
single
miniature
house
is
seen
then
for
nearly
five
miles
along
the
river
not
a
trace
of
the
presence
of
man
is
to
be
met
until
pungo
ferry
and
landing
loom
up
out
of
the
low
marshes
on
the
east
side
of
the
river
this
ferry
with
a
store
of
a
mile
from
the
landing
and
a
farm
of
nearly
two
hundred
acres
is
the
property
of
charles
dudley
a
southern
gentleman
who
offers
every
inducement
in
his
power
to
northern
men
to
settle
in
his
vicinity
many
of
the
in
the
uplands
are
willing
to
sell
portions
of
their
estates
to
induce
northern
men
to
come
among
them
it
was
almost
dark
when
i
reached
the
storehouse
at
pungo
ferry
and
as
sunday
is
a
sacred
day
with
me
i
determined
to
camp
there
until
monday
a
deformed
negro
held
a
lease
of
the
ferry
and
pulled
a
flat
back
and
forth
across
the
river
by
means
of
a
chain
and
windlass
he
was
very
civil
and
placed
his
quarters
at
my
disposal
until
i
should
be
ready
to
start
southward
to
currituck
sound
we
lifted
the
canoe
and
pushed
it
through
an
open
window
into
the
little
where
it
rested
upon
an
unoccupied
counter
the
negro
went
up
to
the
loft
above
and
threw
down
two
large
bundles
of
flags
for
a
bed
upon
which
i
spread
my
blankets
an
old
stove
in
a
corner
was
soon
aglow
with
burning
light
wood
while
i
was
cooking
my
supper
the
little
propeller
cygnet
which
runs
between
norfolk
and
van
slyck
landing
at
currituck
narrows
touched
at
pungo
ferry
and
put
off
an
old
woman
who
had
been
on
a
two
visit
to
her
relatives
she
kindly
accosted
the
dwarfed
black
with
charles
have
you
got
a
match
for
my
pipe
yes
missus
civilly
responded
the
negro
handing
her
a
light
well
this
is
good
soliloquized
the
ancient
dame
as
she
seated
herself
on
a
box
and
puffed
away
at
the
pipe
ah
good
indeed
to
get
away
from
city
folks
with
their
manners
and
queer
ways
when
you
stick
your
knife
in
your
mouth
in
place
of
your
fork
and
you
on
china
tea
in
place
of
dear
old
yaupon
charles
you
ca
reckon
how
i
longs
to
get
a
cup
of
good
yaupon
as
the
reader
is
about
entering
a
country
where
the
laboring
classes
draw
largely
upon
nature
for
their
supply
of
the
cup
that
cheers
but
not
inebriates
i
will
describe
he
shrub
which
produces
it
this
substitute
for
the
tea
of
china
is
a
holly
ilex
and
is
called
by
the
natives
yaupon
cassine
it
is
a
handsome
shrub
growing
a
few
feet
in
height
with
alternate
perennial
shining
leaves
and
bearing
small
scarlet
berries
it
is
found
in
the
vicinity
of
salt
water
in
the
light
soils
of
virginia
and
the
carolinas
the
leaves
and
twigs
are
dried
by
the
women
and
when
ready
for
market
are
sold
at
one
dollar
per
bushel
it
is
not
to
be
compared
in
excellence
with
the
tea
of
china
nor
does
it
approach
in
taste
or
good
qualities
the
yerbamate
another
species
of
holly
which
is
found
in
paraguay
and
is
the
common
drink
of
the
people
of
south
america
the
old
woman
having
gone
on
her
way
and
we
being
again
alone
in
the
rude
little
shanty
the
freedman
told
me
his
history
ending
with
o
that
was
a
glorious
day
for
me
when
massa
lincoln
set
me
free
he
had
too
much
ambition
he
said
deformed
as
he
was
to
be
supported
as
a
pauper
by
the
public
i
can
make
just
about
twelve
dollars
a
month
by
dis
here
ferry
he
exclaimed
i
do
want
for
nuffin
got
no
wife
no
woman
will
hab
me
i
want
to
support
myself
and
live
an
honest
man
about
seven
he
left
me
to
waddle
up
the
road
nearly
a
mile
to
a
little
house
i
an
another
cullo
man
live
in
partnership
he
said
he
could
not
account
for
the
fact
that
i
had
no
fear
of
sleeping
alone
in
the
shanty
on
the
marshes
he
went
home
for
the
company
of
his
partner
as
he
did
like
to
sleep
alone
noways
though
the
cold
wind
entered
through
broken
and
under
the
rudely
constructed
door
i
slept
comfortably
until
morning
before
charles
had
returned
my
breakfast
was
cooked
and
eaten
with
the
sunshine
of
the
morning
came
a
new
visitor
i
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
late
slave
now
i
received
a
call
from
the
late
master
my
visitor
was
a
pleasant
gentlemanly
personage
the
owner
of
the
surrounding
acres
his
large
white
house
could
be
seen
from
the
landing
a
quarter
of
a
mile
up
the
road
i
learned
that
a
stranger
from
the
north
was
camped
here
and
was
expecting
that
he
would
come
up
and
take
breakfast
with
me
was
his
kindly
way
of
introducing
himself
i
told
him
i
was
comfortably
established
in
dry
quarters
and
did
not
feel
justified
in
forcing
myself
upon
his
hospitality
while
i
had
so
many
good
things
of
this
life
in
my
dudley
would
take
no
excuse
but
conducted
me
to
his
house
where
i
remained
that
day
attending
the
religious
services
in
a
little
church
in
the
vicinity
my
kind
host
introduced
me
to
his
neighbors
several
of
whom
returned
with
us
to
dinner
i
found
the
people
about
pungo
ferry
like
those
i
had
met
along
the
sounds
of
the
eastern
shore
of
maryland
and
virginia
very
piously
inclined
the
same
kindhearted
hospitable
people
my
host
entertained
me
the
next
day
which
was
rainy
with
his
life
in
the
confederate
army
in
which
he
served
as
a
lieutenant
he
was
a
prisoner
at
johnson
island
for
months
he
bore
no
malice
towards
northern
men
who
came
south
to
join
with
the
natives
in
working
for
the
true
interests
of
the
country
the
people
of
the
south
had
become
weary
of
political
sufferings
inflicted
by
a
floating
population
from
the
north
they
needed
actual
settlers
not
politicians
this
sentiment
i
found
everywhere
expressed
on
tuesday
i
bade
farewell
to
my
new
friends
and
rowed
down
the
north
landing
river
towards
currituck
sound
the
north
carolina
line
is
only
a
few
miles
south
of
the
ferry
the
river
enters
the
head
of
the
sound
six
or
eight
miles
below
pungo
ferry
a
stiff
northerly
breeze
was
blowing
and
as
the
river
widened
on
reaching
the
head
of
the
sound
to
a
mile
or
more
and
bays
were
to
be
crossed
from
point
to
point
it
required
the
exercise
of
considerable
patience
and
muscular
exertion
to
keep
the
sea
from
boarding
the
little
craft
amidship
as
i
was
endeavoring
to
weather
a
point
the
swivel
of
one
of
the
outriggers
parted
at
its
junction
with
the
and
it
became
necessary
to
get
under
the
south
point
of
the
marshes
for
shelter
the
lee
side
offered
a
smooth
bay
it
was
but
a
few
minutes
work
to
unload
and
haul
the
canoe
into
the
tall
rushes
which
afforded
ample
protection
against
the
cold
wind
it
was
three
hours
before
the
wind
went
down
when
the
canoe
was
launched
and
propelled
by
the
double
paddle
always
kept
in
reserve
against
accidents
to
oars
and
i
continued
over
the
waters
of
currituck
sound
swans
could
now
be
seen
in
flocks
of
twenties
and
fifties
they
were
exceedingly
wary
not
permitting
the
canoe
to
approach
within
rifle
range
clouds
of
ducks
and
some
canada
geese
as
well
as
brant
kept
up
a
continuous
flutter
as
they
rose
from
the
surface
of
the
water
away
to
the
southeast
extended
the
glimmering
bosom
of
the
sound
with
a
few
islands
relieving
its
monotony
the
three
or
four
houses
and
two
small
storehouses
at
the
landing
of
currituck
court
house
which
with
the
brick
comprise
the
whole
village
are
situated
on
the
west
bank
and
opposite
eight
miles
to
the
eastward
is
the
narrow
beach
island
that
serves
as
a
barrier
to
the
ingress
of
the
ocean
at
sunset
i
started
the
last
flock
of
white
swans
and
grounded
in
the
shoal
waters
at
the
landing
there
is
no
regular
hotel
here
but
a
kind
lady
simmons
accommodates
the
necessities
of
the
occasional
traveller
the
canoe
was
soon
locked
up
in
the
fortunately
a
blacksmith
was
found
outside
the
village
who
promised
to
repair
the
broken
rowlock
early
upon
the
following
morning
before
a
pleasant
wood
fire
giving
out
its
heat
from
a
grand
old
fireplace
with
an
agreeable
visitor
the
physician
of
the
place
the
tediousness
of
the
camp
on
the
marshes
was
soon
forgotten
while
the
country
and
its
resources
were
fully
discussed
until
a
late
hour
baxter
had
experimented
in
grape
culture
and
gave
me
many
interesting
details
in
regard
to
the
native
wine
in
lawson
described
six
varieties
of
native
grapes
found
in
north
carolina
our
three
finest
varieties
of
native
grapes
were
taken
from
north
carolina
they
are
the
scuppernong
the
catawba
and
the
isabella
the
scuppernong
was
found
upon
the
banks
of
the
stream
bearing
that
name
the
mouth
of
which
is
near
the
eastern
end
of
albemarle
sound
the
catawba
was
originally
obtained
on
the
catawba
river
near
its
in
buncombe
county
the
long
island
stock
of
the
isabella
grape
was
brought
to
new
york
by
isabella
gibbs
hence
the
derivation
of
the
name
of
the
six
varieties
of
north
carolina
grapes
five
were
found
in
tyrrel
county
by
amadas
and
barlow
tradition
relates
that
these
travellers
carried
one
small
vine
to
roanoke
island
which
still
lives
and
covers
an
immense
area
of
ground
there
are
five
varieties
of
the
grape
growing
wild
on
the
shores
of
albemarle
sound
all
of
which
are
called
scuppernong
the
legitimate
scuppernong
being
a
white
grape
sweet
and
large
and
producing
a
wine
said
to
resemble
somewhat
in
its
luscious
flavor
the
malmsey
made
on
mount
ida
in
candia
the
repairing
of
the
outrigger
detained
me
until
nearly
noon
of
the
next
day
when
the
canoe
was
got
under
way
but
upon
rowing
off
the
mouth
of
coanjock
bay
only
four
miles
from
currituck
court
house
a
strong
tempest
arose
from
the
south
and
observing
an
old
gentleman
standing
upon
bell
island
point
near
his
cottage
beckoning
me
to
come
ashore
i
obeyed
and
took
refuge
with
my
new
acquaintance
captain
peter
tatum
proprietor
of
bell
island
the
war
has
left
us
without
servants
said
the
captain
as
he
presented
me
to
his
wife
so
we
make
the
best
of
it
and
if
you
will
accept
our
hospitality
we
will
make
you
comfortable
captain
tatum
drew
my
attention
to
the
flocks
of
swans
which
dotted
the
waters
in
the
offing
and
said
it
is
hard
work
to

you
must
use
a
good
rifle
to
bring
one
down
after
a
strong
norther
has
been
blowing
and
the
birds
have
worked
well
into

than
forty
years

old
currituck
inlet
closed
and
the
oysters
on
the
natural
beds
which
extended
up
north
landing
river
to
green
point
were
killed
by
the
freshening
of
the

now
winds
influence
the

which
enter
at

about
miles
south
of
the

the
difference
between
the
highest

at
currituck

is
three
feet
the

is
filled
with
sandy
shoals
with
here
and
there
spots
of
mud
the
shells
of
the
defunct
oysters
are
everywhere
found
mixed
with
the
debris
of
the
bottom
of

this
is
a
favorite
locality
with
northern

thursday
the
of
december
was
cold
and
proved
as
tempestuous
as
the
previous
day
but
the
wind
had
changed
to
the
north
and
i
embarked
amid
a
swashy
with
the
hope
of
reaching
van
slyck
landing
at
currituck
narrows
the
norther
however
proved
too
much
for
my
safety
my
course
would
be
easterly
until
i
had
passed
the
mouth
of
coanjock
bay
and
goose
castle
point
then
following
the
trend
of
the
west
shore
southerly
down
the
sound
but
the
wind
raised
such
a
rough
sea
that
i
was
obliged
to
turn
southward
into
coanjock
bay
ascend
it
five
miles
and
seek
for
a
overland
to
the
sound
again
which
i
found
near
the
entrance
of
the
lockless
canal
that
is
used
by
steamers
to
pass
from
north
landing
river
to
north
river
and
albemarle
sound
a
fire
was
soon
built
upon
which
i
placed
long
light
poles
taken
from
the
and
burning
them
in
pieces
of
the
required
lengths
no
axe
being
at
hand
i
was
prepared
to
make
the
portage
laying
these
pieces
of
wood
on
the
ground
i
drew
my
canoe
over
them
to
the
shore
of
currituck
sound
then
by
making
up
of
the
cargo
transported
everything
to
the
point
of
embarkation
which
was
just
inside
the
mouth
of
a
little
creek
the
row
to
currituck
narrows
was
not
difficult
as
the
north
wind
was
a
fair
one
along
the
west
shore
of
the
sound
there
were
many
little
houses
upon
the
high
banks
and
a
windmill
supplied
the
place
of
a
for
grinding
corn
the
improvements
made
by
van
slyck
of
new
york
were
in
cheering
contrast
to
what
had
been
seen
since
leaving
norfolk
here
a
comfortable
hotel
welcomes
the
northern
sportsmen
few
of
whom
for
lack
of
accommodations
and
travelling
conveniences
go
much
south
of
this
locality
in
this
state
to
shoot
currituck
sound
has
an
average
width
of
four
miles
its
length
is
about
miles
at
the
narrows
a
group
of
marshy
islands
divides
it
into
two
sections
the
northern
one
being
the
longest
the
keen
cold
air
of
the
next
day
made
rowing
a
pleasant
exercise
after
passing
through
the
tortuous
channel
i
should
have
crossed
to
the
beach
and
followed
it
but
this
part
of
the
bay
is
very
shallow
and
deeper
water
was
found
on
the
west
side
it
was
an
enjoyable
morning
for
gunners
were
passed
secreted
behind
their
blinds
or
pens
of
pine
brush
which
looked
like
little
groves
of
conifera
growing
out
of
the
shoal
water
geese
were
honking
and
ducks
were
quacking
while
the
deep
booming
of
guns
was
heard
every
few
minutes
were
anchored
in
many
places
near
the
marshes
every
sportsman
gave
me
a
cheering
word
as
the
canoe
glided
over
the
smooth
water
while
here
and
there
the
swallow
darted
about
over
the
marshes
as
though
it
were
summer
when
opposite
dew
quarter
island
several
men
hailed
me
from
a
newly
constructed
shanty
when
the
oldest
man
in
the
company
who
had
never
seen
a
shell
like
the
paper
canoe
had
examined
it
he
shook
his
head
ominously
and
when
i
told
him
nag
head
must
be
reached
that
day
he
grew
excited
exclaiming
then
be
off
now
now
git
across
the
bay
under
bald
beach
as
soon
as
ye
can
and
hug
the
shore
hug
it
well
clean
down
to
collington
and
git
across
the
sound
afore
the
wind
rises
sich
a
boat
as
that
are
fit
for
these
here
waters
taking
this
kindly
meant
advice
i
pulled
to
the
east
side
where
there
was
now
a
good
depth
of
water
for
the
canoe
on
this
high
beach
the
hills
were
well
covered
with
yellow
pines
many
of
which
were
noble
old
trees
on
a
narrow
point
of
the
shore
was
the
comfortable
house
of
hodges
gallup
the
baptist
minister
a
generous
old
gentleman
who
seemed
to
be
loved
by
all
the
watermen
along
the
sound
he
was
described
as
being
full
of
fun
and
hospitality
his
domain
extended
for
several
miles
along
the
beach
and
with
deer
quietly
browsing
in
his
grand
old
woods
formed
a
pretty
picture
the
beach
shore
now
became
more
thickly
settled
while
out
in
the
water
a
few
rods
from
each
little
house
arose
the
with
the
gunner
and
his
boat
inside
anxiously
watching
for
birds
while
their
decoys
floated
quietly
on
the
surface
of
the
water
a
few
miles
below
gallup
estate
the
canoe
entered
upon
the
broad
waters
of
albemarle
sound
and
at
dusk
i
approached
roanoke
island
the
large
buildings
of
the
hotels
of
nag
head
on
the
beach
rose
up
as
boldly
to
the
eye
as
a
fortification
the
little
sound
between
roanoke
island
and
the
beach
was
traversed
at
dusk
as
far
as
the
first
long
pier
of
nag
head
upon
which
with
great
difficulty
i
landed
and
was
soon
joined
by
the
keeper
of
the
now
deserted
summer
watering
place

helped
me
to
carry
my
property
into
a

a
most
desolate
locality
with
its
high
composed
of
fine
sand
the
forms
of
which
are
constantly
changing
with
the
action
of
the
dry
hard
varying
winds
a
new
and
very
large
hotel
was
located
south
of
the
first
one
and
was
inhabited
by
the
family
of
captain
jasper
toler
who
furnished
me
with
lodgings
a
few
fishermen
have
their
homes
on
this
dreary
beach
but
the
village
with
its
one
store
is
a
forlorn
place
the
bright
flashes
of
body

ten
miles
distant
on
the
north
side
of
oregon
inlet
showed
me
my
next
the
beach
from
nag
head
to
oregon
inlet
is
destitute
of
trees
and
the
wind
sweeps
across
it
from
the
ocean
to
the
sound
with
great
violence
forcing
the
shallow
waters
to
retire
and
leaving
the
bottom
dry
as
far
out
as
three
miles
the
next
day
was
very
windy
and
the
long
sandy
shoals
which
extended
one
or
two
miles
out
into
the
sound
were
covered
with
only
from
three
to
eight
inches
of
water
i
could
not
hug
the
beach
for
protection
but
was
forced
to
keep
far
out
in
the
sound
frequently
it
became
necessary
to
get
overboard
and
wade
pushing
my
boat
before
me
then
a
deep
channel
between
the
shoals
would
be
crossed
so
by
walking
and
rowing
in
roanoke

the

the

over
the
canoe
and
drenching

miles
passage
to

at

accomplished
and
a
most
trying
one
it
was

falling
rapidly
when
i
crawled
into
the
high
rushes
of
the
wet
marsh
near
the
to
seek
shelter
from
the
strong
wind
that
was
blowing
as
this
treeless
beach
was
destitute
of
or
natural
shelter
of
any
kind
necessity
compelled
me
to
have
recourse
to
other
means
for
procuring
them
i
carried
in
my
pocket
a
talisman
which
must
open
any
door
from
maine
to

shivering
in

thankfully
did
i
remember
that
kind
and
thoughtful
friend
who
through
his
potent
influence
had
supplied
me
with
this
open
sesame
to
lightkeepers
there
resides
in

when
not
engaged
elsewhere
in
the
important

of
america
turn
for
information
and
advice
and
to
the
humblest
applicant
professor
spencer

never
turns
a
deaf
ear
how
this
distinguished
author
can
attend
to
so
many
and
such
varied
duties
with
his
laborious
investigations
and
can
so
successfully
keep
up
a
large
correspondence
with
perhaps
one
thousand
scientific
associations
of
nearly
every
nation
of
the
universe
is
a
difficult
thing
to
imagine
but
the
popular
and
much
beloved
assistant
secretary
of
the
smithsonian
institution
seemingly
ubiquitous
in
his
busy
life
does
all
this
and
much
more
america
may
well
feel
proud
of
this
man
of
noble
nature
shedding
light
and
truth
wheresoever
he
moves
encouraging
alike
old
and
young
with
his
kindly
sympathy
now
taking
his
precious
moments
to
answer
with
his
own
busy
hand
the
question
in
the
letter
of
some
boy
naturalist
about
beasts
birds
reptiles
or
fishes
with
which
epistles
his
desk
is
always
covered
now
stimulating
to
further
effort
the
old
man
of
science
as
he
struggles
with
the
cares
of
this
world
striving
sometimes
vainly
save
for
this
ever
ready
aid
to
work
out
patiently
theories
which
are
soon
to
blaze
forth
as
substantial
facts
the
young
generation
of
naturalists
which
is
soon
to
fill
the
place
of
their
predecessors
have
in
this
man
the
type
of
all
they
need
ever
strive
to
attain
how
many
alas
will
fall
far
short
of
it
since
boyhood
the
counsels
of
this
friend
had
guided
me
on
many
a
journey
of
exploration
he
had
not
deserted
me
even
in
this
experiment
which
my
friends
called
your
wildest
and
most
foolish
undertaking
he
had
obtained
from
the
light
house
board
a
general
letter
to
the
lightkeepers
of
the
united
states
signed
by
the
naval
secretary
walker
in
which
the
keepers
were
authorized
to
grant
me
shelter
when
necessary
i
did
not
have
occasion
to
use
this
letter
more
than
twice
during
my
journey
having
secreted
my
canoe
in
the
coarse
grass
of
the
lowland
i
trudged
with
my
letter
in
hand
over
the
sands
to
the
house
of
the
captain
hatzel
who
received
me
cordially
and
after
recording
in
his
the
circumstances
and
date
of
my
arrival
conducted
me
into
a
comfortable
room
which
was
warmed
by
a
cheerful
fire
and
lighted
up
by
the
smiles
of
his
most
orderly
wife
everything
showed
discipline
and
neatness
both
in
the
house
and
the
the
whitest
of
cloths
was
spread
upon
the
table
and
covered
with
a
meal
then
the
father
mother
and
two
sons
with
the
stranger
within
their
gates
thanked
the
giver
of
good
gifts
for
his
mercies
joining
the
of
the
chief
lightkeeper
i
also
joined
in
the
good
enthusiasm
for
his
wonderful
fixed
white
light
the
bright
beams
of
which
poured
out
upon
the
surrounding
waters
a
flood
if
brilliancy
gladdening
hearts
far
out
at
sea
even
though
twenty
miles
away
and
plainly
saying
this
is
body
island
beach
keep
off
how
grand
it
was
to
walk
out
on
this
gallery
in
the
sky
looking
eastward
a
limitless
expanse
of
ocean
gazing
westward
the
waters
of
the
great
sound
the
shores
of
which
were
low
marshes
miles
away
below
me
could
be
heard
the
soft
cackle
of
the
anser
hyperboreus
which
had
left
its
on
the
barren
grounds
of
arctic
america
and
was
now
feeding
contentedly
in
its
winter
home
in
the
shallow
which
the
gentle
of
the
waves
softly
broke
on
the
strand
above
the
heavens
whose
tender
beauty
seemed
almost
within
my
grasp
perched
thus
upon
a
single
shaft
on
a
narrow
strip
of
sand
far
out
in
the
great
water
the
many
thoughts
born
of
solitude
crowded
my
mind
when
my
reverie
was
abruptly
broken
by
an
exclamation
from
captain
hatzel
who
threw
open
the
door
and
exclaimed
with
beaming
eyes
peering
into
the
darkness
as
he
spoke
i
see
it
yes
it
is
hatteras
light
miles
away
this
night
december
is
the
first
time
i
have
caught
its
flash
tell
it
to
the
hatteras
keeper
when
you
visit
the
cape
from
captain
hatzel
i
gleaned
some
facts
of
deep
interest
in
regard
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
sound
some
of
them
he
told
me
had
indian
blood
in
their
veins
and
to
prove
the
truth
of
his
assertion
he
handed
me
a
copy
of
the
history
of
north
carolina
by
francis
hawks
from
this
i
obtained
facts
which
might
serve
for
the
intricate
mazes
of
a
romance
it
had
been
a
pet
scheme
with
sir
walter
raleigh
to
colonize
the
coast
of
north
carolina
then
known
as
virginia
and
though
several
expeditions
had
been
sent
out
for
that
object
each
had
failed
of
successful
issue
one
of
these
expeditions
sent
by
sir
walter
to
roanoke
island
consisted
of
one
hundred
and
persons
of
whom
seventeen
were
women
and
six
children
of
all
these
souls
only
two
men
returned
to
the
old
country
the
fate
of
the
remainder
being
unknown
and
shrouded
in
the
gloom
which
always
attends
mystery
england
did
not
however
leave
her
children
to
perish
on
a
barren
shore
in
the
new
land
without
at
least
an
effort
to
succor
them
on
march
in
the
year
there
sailed
from
plymouth
three
ships
the
hopewell
john
evangelist
and
little
john
taking
in
tow
two
shallops
which
were
afterwards
lost
at
sea
in
these
days
the
largest
vessels
of
a
fleet
did
not
exceed
one
hundred
to
one
hundred
and
forty
tons
burden
this
expedition
was
under
the
charge
of
admiral
john
white
governor
of
the
colony
of
sir
walter
raleigh
on
roanoke
island
and
who
had
left
the
feeble
band
on
the
island
in
in
days
and
eight
hours
these
small
vessels
arrived
off
hatorask
hatteras
beach
the
fleet
dropped
anchor
three
leagues
off
the
beach
and
sent
a
boat
through
an
inlet
to
pamplico
sound
there
existed
in
those
days
passages
from
the
ocean
through
the
beaches
into
the
sounds
which
have
since
been
filled
up
by
the
action
of
the
sea
old
roanoke
inlet
now
closed
which
was
about
four
miles
north
of
the
modern
oregon
inlet
is
supposed
to
be
the
one
used
by
sir
walter
raleigh
expeditions
it
is
only
four
miles
from
the
site
of
this
closed
inlet
to
shallowbag
bay
on
roanoke
island
at
the
southern
entrance
of
the
bay
near
ballast
point
some
vessel
evidently
grounded
and
threw
overboard
her
stone
ballast
hence
the
name
of
the
point
captain
hatzel
has
examined
this
stone
and
gives
his
opinion
as
an
old
pilot
that
it
is
foreign
in
character
he
never
met
with
similar
stones
and
believes
that
this
ballast
was
deposited
at
shallowbag
bay
by
some
of
the
vessels
of
sir
walter
expeditions
as
the
boat
crew
above
mentioned
rowed
northward
to
roanoke
island
made
famous
two
hundred
and
years
later
by
the
national
and
confederate
struggles
they
sounded
their
trumpets
and
sang
familiar
songs
which
they
hoped
might
be
borne
to
their
countrymen
on
the
shore
but
the
marshes
and
upland
wilderness
returned
no
answering
voice
at
daybreak
the
explorers
landed
upon
roanoke
island
which
is
twelve
miles
long
by
two
and
a
half
wide
and
found
the
spot
where
admiral
white
had
left
the
colony
in
eagerly
searching
for
any
tokens
of
the
lost
ones
they
soon
traced
in
the
light
soil
of
the
island
the
imprint
of
the
moccasin
of
the
savage
but
looked
in
vain
for
any
footprint
of
civilized
man
what
had
become
of
their
countrymen
at
last
some
one
spied
a
conspicuous
tree
far
up
on
a
sandy
bank
blazed
and
carved
there
were
but
three
letters
cut
upon
it
but
these
simple
symbols
possessed
a
world
of
meaning
three
years
before
when
the
sad
farewells
were
being
spoken
and
the
ships
were
ready
to
set
sail
for
england
this
feeble
band
left
to
struggle
in
the
wilds
of
the
new
land
with
sad
forebodings
of
their
possible
fate
had
agreed
upon
a
signal
and
had
promised
admiral
white
that
if
driven
to
starvation
upon
the
island
they
would
plant
their
colony
fifty
miles
inland
near
a
tribe
of
friendly
indians
indeed
before
the
ships
sailed
for
england
they
were
making
preparations
for
this
move
admiral
white
requested
them
to
carve
upon
a
tree
the
name
of
the
locality
to
which
they
should
remove
and
if
distress
had
overtaken
them
they
were
to
add
a
cross
over
the
lettering
anxiously
gathering
round
this
interesting
relic
of
the
lost
englishmen
the
rude
chirography
was
eagerly
scanned
but
no
vestige
of
a
cross
was
found
much
relieved
in
mind
the
little
company
continued
their
investigations
when
farther
on
almost
in
their
very
pathway
there
rose
a
noble
tree
pointing
its
top
heavenward
as
though
to
remind
them
in
whose
care
their
lost
ones
had
been
approaching
this
giant
who
had
stood
a
silent
sentinel
through
winter
storms
and
summer
skies
they
found
he
bore
upon
his
body
a
message
for
them
stripped
of
its
bark
five
feet
upward
from
the
ground
there
appeared
upon
the
bare
surface
in
bold
lettering
the
word
so
full
of
hope
croatan
and
now
also
as
in
the
last
case
without
the
graven
cross
cheered
by
these
signs
and
believing
that
the
lost
colonists
had
carried
out
their
early
intentions
and
were
now
located
among
the
friendly
tribe
of
croatans
wheresoever
their
country
might
be
the
boat
company
decided
to
go
at
once
to
the
ships
and
return
the
next
day
in
search
of
the
lost
colony
one
of
the
ships
in
moving
its
position
from
the
unprotected
parted
its
cable
and
left
an
anchor
on
the
bottom
the
second
that
had
been
lost
the
wind
drove
the
ships
towards
the
beach
when
a
third
anchor
was
lowered
but
it
held
the
little
fleet
so
close
in
to
the
breakers
that
the
sailors
were
forced
to
slip
their
cable
and
work
into
a
where
in
deeper
water
they
held
their
ground
in
debating
the
propriety
of
holding
on
and
attempting
to
wear
out
the
gale
the
scarcity
of
their
provisions
and
the
possession
of
but
one
cask
of
water
and
only
one
anchor
for
the
fleet
to
ride
at
decided
them
to
go
southward
in
quest
of
some
favorable
landing
where
water
could
be
found
the
council
held
out
the
hope
of
capturing
spanish
vessels
in
the
vicinity
of
the
west
indies
and
it
was
agreed
that
if
successful
they
should
return
richly
laden
with
spoil
to
seek
their
exiled
countrymen
one
of
these
vessels
returned
to
england
while
the
admiral
laid
his
course
for
trinidad
and
this
was
the
last
attempt
made
to
find
the
colonists
more
than
a
century
after
admiral
white
had
abandoned
his
colony
lawson
in
writing
about
the
hatteras
indians
says
they
said
that
several
of
their
ancestors
were
white
people
and
could
talk
in
a
book
as
we
do
the
truth
of
which
is
confirmed
by
grey
eyes
being
frequently
found
among
them
and
no
others
they
value
themselves
extremely
for
their
affinity
to
the
english
and
are
ready
to
do
them
all
friendly
offices
it
is
probable
that
the
settlement
miscarried
for
want
of
supplies
from
england
or
through
the
treachery
of
the
natives
for
we
may
reasonably
suppose
that
the
english
were
forced
to
cohabit
with
them
for
relief
and
conversation
and
that
in
process
of
time
they
conformed
themselves
to
the
manners
of
their
indian
relations
hawks
thinks
that
driven
by
starvation
such
as
survived
the
famine
were
merged
into
the
tribes
of
friendly
indians
at
croatan
and
alas
lost
ere
long
every
vestige
of
christianity
and
civilization
and
those
who
came
to
shed
light
on
the
darkness
of
paganism
in
the
mysterious
providence
of
god
ended
by
relapsing
themselves
into
the
heathenism
they
came
to
remove
it
is
a
sad
picture
of
poor
human
nature
it
needed
not
the
fierce
gusts
of
wind
that
howled
about
the
tall
tower
causing
it
to
vibrate
until
water
would
be
spilled
out
of
a
pail
resting
upon
the
floor
of
the
lantern
blowing
one
day
from
one
quarter
of
the
compass
and
changing
the
next
to
another
to
warn
me
that
i
was
near
the
cape
of
storms
refusing
to
continue
longer
with
my
new
friends
the
canoe
was
put
into
the
water
on
the
and
captain
hatzel
two
sons
proceeded
in
advance
with
a
strong
boat
to
break
a
channelway
through
the
thin
ice
which
had
formed
in
the
quiet
coves
we
were
soon
out
in
the
sound
where
the
boys
left
me
and
i
rowed
out
of
the
southern
end
of
roanoke
and
entered
upon
the
wide
area
of
pamplico
sound
to
avoid
shoals
it
being
calm
i
kept
about
three
miles
from
the
beach
in
three
feet
of
water
until
beyond
duck
island
when
the
trees
on
roanoke
island
slowly
sank
below
the
horizon
then
gradually
drawing
in
to
the
beach
the
two
clumps
of
trees
of
north
and
south
chicamicomio
came
into
view
a
station
had
recently
been
erected
north
of
the
first
grove
and
there
is
another
fourteen
miles
further
south
the
two
chicamicomio
settlements
of
scattered
houses
are
each
nearly
a
mile
in
length
and
are
separated
by
a
high
bald
of
about
the
same
length
which
was
once
heavily
wooded
but
the
wind
has
blown
the
sand
into
the
forest
and
destroyed
it
a
in
each
village
raised
its
weird
arms
to
the
breeze
three
miles
further
down
is
kitty
hammock
where
a
few
red
cedars
and
some
remains
of
tell
of
the
extensive
forest
that
once
covered
the
beach
here
captain
abraham
hooper
lives
and
occupies
himself
in
fishing
with
nets
in
the
ocean
for
which
are
salted
down
and
sent
to
the
inland
towns
for
a
market
i
had
drawn
my
boat
into
the
sedge
to
secure
a
night
shelter
when
the
old
captain
on
his
rounds
captured
me
the
change
from
a
bed
in
the
damp
sedge
to
the
inside
seat
of
the
largest
fireplace
i
had
ever
beheld
was
indeed
a
pleasant
one
its
inviting
front
covered
almost
one
side
of
the
room
while
the
fire
flashed
up
the
wide
chimney
i
sat
inside
the
fireplace
with
the
three
children
of
my
host
and
enjoyed
the
genial
glow
which
arose
from
the
fragments
of
the
wreck
of
a
vessel
which
had
pounded
herself
to
death
upon
the
strand
near
kitty
hammock
how
curiously
those
children
watched
the
man
who
had
come
so
far
in
a
paper
boat
why
did
not
the
paper
boat
soak
to
pieces
they
asked
each
explanation
seemed
but
to
puzzle
them
the
more
and
i
found
myself
in
much
the
same
condition
of
mind
when
trying
to
make
some
discoveries
concerning
kitty
midget
she
must
however
have
lived
somewhere
on
clark
beach
long
before
the
present
proprietor
was
born
we
spent
the
next
day
fishing
with
nets
in
the
surf
for
it
being
about
the
last
day
of
their
stay
in
that
vicinity
they
go
south
as
far
as
cape
hatteras
and
then
disappear
in
deep
water
while
the
great
flocks
of
gulls
that
accompany
them
to
gather
the
remnants
of
fish
they
scatter
in
their
savage
meals
rise
in
the
air
and
fly
rapidly
away
in
search
of
other
dainties
on
thursday
i
set
out
for
cape
hatteras
the
old
sailor
song
that
hatteras
has
a
blow
in
store
for
those
who
pass
her
howling
door
has
far
more
truth
than
poetry
in
it
before
proceeding
far
the
wind
blew
a
tempest
when
a
young
fisherman
in
his
sailboat
bore
down
upon
me
and
begged
me
to
come
on
board
we
attempted
to
tow
the
canoe
astern
but
she
filled
with
water
which
obliged
us
to
take
her
on
board
as
we
flew
along
before
the
wind
dashing
over
the
shoals
with
temerity
i
discovered
that
my
new
acquaintance
burnett
was
a
most
daring
as
well
as
reckless
sailor
he
told
me
how
he
had
capsized
his
schooner
by
carrying
sail
too
long
this
slow
way
of
doing
things
he
detested
his
recital
was
characteristic
of
the
man
you
see
sir
we
was
bound
for
newbern
up
the
neuse
river
and
as
we
were
well
into
the
sound
with
all
sail
set
and
travelling
along
lively
daddy
says
i
reckon
a
little
yaupon
would
hurt
me
so
i
go
below
and
start
a
firs
under
the
kittle
do
as
you
likes
daddy
sez
i
so
down
below
he
goes
and
i
takes
command
of
the
schooner
a
big
black
squall
soon
come
over
cape
hatteras
from
the
gulf
stream
and
it
did
look
like
a
screecher
now
i
thought
old
woman
i
make
your
sides
ache
so
i
pinted
her
at
it
and
afore
i
could
luff
her
up
in
the
wind
the
squall
kreened
her
on
to
her
you
a
laughed
to
have
split
yourself
mister
if
you
could
have
seen
daddy
out
of
the
while
the
water
was
down
stairs
like
a
crick
says
he
ruther
hurriedly
what
up
it
is
what
up
daddy
but
what
down
sez
i
it
sort
o
looks
as
if
we
had
capsized
sure
answered
dad
as
the
ballast
shifted
and
the
schooner
rolled
over
keel
uppermost
we
floundered
about
like
porpoises
but
managed
to
get
astride
her
backbone
when
dad
looked
kind
of
scornfully
at
me
and
burst
out
with
do
you
call
yourself
a
keerful
sailor
enough
dad
sez
i
a
smart
one
it
more
credit
to
a
man
to
drive
his
vessel
like
a
sailor
than
to
be
crawling
and
bobbing
along
like
a
terrapin
now
stranger
if
you
believe
me
that
keerful
old
father
of
mine
would
never
let
me
take
the
helum
again
so
i
sticks
to
my
aunt
at
the
cape
i
found
that
the
boat
in
which
we
were
sailing
was
a
made
from
two
immense
cypress
logs
larger
boats
than
this
are
made
of
three
logs
and
smaller
ones
are
dug
out
of
one
burnett
told
me
that
frame
boats
were
so
easily
pounded
to
pieces
on
the
shoals
that
were
preferred
being
very
durable
we
soon
passed
the
hamlet
of
north
kinnakeet
then
scarsborough
with
its
low
houses
then
south
kinnakeet
with
its
two
and
after
these
arose
a
sterile
bald
beach
with
hatteras
piercing
the
sky
and
west
of
it
hatteras
woods
and
marshes
we
approached
the
low
shore
and
ascended
a
little
creek
where
we
left
our
boats
and
repaired
to
the
cottage
of
burnett
aunt
after
the
barren
shores
i
had
passed
this
little
house
imbedded
in
living
green
was
like
a
bright
star
in
a
dark
night
it
was
hidden
away
in
a
heavy
thicket
of
and
cedars
and
surrounded
by
yaupons
the
bright
red
berries
of
which
glistened
against
the
light
green
leaves
an
old
woman
stood
in
the
doorway
with
a
kindly
greeting
for
her
wild
boy
rejoicing
the
while
that
he
had
got
back
to
his
old
aunty
once
more
yes
aunty
said
my
friend
lorenzo
i
am
back
again
like
a

penny
but
not
for
as
soon
as
our

of
is

old
aunty
will
have
sixty
or
seventy
dollars
he
has
a

if
he

so
whispered
the
motherly
woman
as
she
wiped
a
tear
from
her
eyes
and
gazed
with
pride
upon
the
young
fellow

invited

to

sometimes
sit
upon

and
looking
along
the
pathway
of

which
shoots
into

over
their
heads
will
see
a
few
dark
specks
approaching
them
in
this

these
specks
are
birds
confused
by
the
bright

ready
to
fall
an
easy
prey

on
that
interesting
subject
here
also
was
george
onslow
of
the
united
states
signal
service
who
had
completed
his
work
of
constructing
a
telegraph
line
from
norfolk
along
the
beach
southward
to
this
point
its
present
terminus
with
a
fine
telescope
he
could
frequently
identify
vessels
a
few
miles
from
the
cape
and
telegraph
their
position
to
new
york
he
had
lately
saved
a
vessel
by
telegraphing
to
norfolk
its
dangerous
location
on
hatteras
beach
where
it
had
grounded
by
this
timely
notice
a
had
arrived
and
hauled
the
schooner
off
in
good
condition
a
low
range
of
hills
commences
at
cape
hatteras
in
the
rear
of
the
and
extends
nearly
to
hatteras
inlet
this
range
is
heavily
wooded
with
yellow
pines
yaupons
cedars
and
the
fishermen
and
wreckers
live
in
rudely
constructed
houses
sheltered
by
this
thicket
which
is
dense
enough
to
protect
them
from
the
strong
winds
that
blow
from
the
ocean
and
the
sound
i
walked
twelve
miles
through
this
pretty
green
retreat
and
spent
sunday
with
homer
styron
who
keeps
a
small
store
about
two
miles
from
the
inlet
he
is
a
astronomer
and
used
an
ingeniously
constructed
telescope
of
his
own
manufacture
for
studying
the
heavens
i
found
at
the
in
his
store
a
letter
from
a
yachting
party
which
had
left
newbern
north
carolina
to
capture
the
paper
canoe
and
to
force
upon
its
captain
the
hospitality
of
the
people
of
that
city
on
the
neuse
river
one
hundred
miles
from
the
cape
judge
west
the
owner
of
the
yacht
julia
and
his
friends
had
been
cruising
since
the
eleventh
day
of
the
month
from
ocracoke
inlet
to
roanoke
island
in
search
of
me
judge
west
in
his
letter
expressed
a
strong
desire
to
have
me
take
my
christmas
dinner
with
his
family
this
generous
treatment
from
a
stranger
was
fully
appreciated
and
i
determined
to
push
on
to
morehead
city
from
which
place
it
would
be
convenient
to
reach
newbern
by
rail
without
changing
my
established
route
southward
as
i
would
be
compelled
to
do
if
the
regular
water
route
of
the
neuse
river
from
pamlico
sound
were
followed
on
this
saturday
night
spent
at
hatteras
inlet
there
broke
upon
us
one
of
the
fiercest
tempests
i
ever
witnessed
even
in
the
tropics
my
pedestrian
tramp
down
the
shore
had
scarcely
ended
when
it
commenced
in
reality
for
miles
along
the
beach
thousands
of
acres
of
land
were
soon
submerged
by
the
sea
and
by
the
torrents
of
water
which
fell
from
the
clouds
while
for
a
moment
the
night
was
dark
as
erebus
again
the
vivid
flash
of
lightning
exposed
to
view
the
swaying
forests
and
the
gloomy
sound
the
sea
pounded
on
the
beach
as
if
asking
for
admission
to
old
pamplico
it
seemed
to
say
i
demand
a
new
inlet
and
as
though
trying
to
carry
out
its
desire
sent
great
waves
rolling
up
the
shingle
and
over
into
the
hollows
among
the
hills
washing
down
the
low
sand
dunes
as
if
they
also
were
in
collusion
with
it
to
remove
this
frail
barrier
this
narrow
strip
of
low
land
which
separated
the
atlantic
from
the
wide
interior
sheet
of
water
the
phosphorescent
sea
covered
with
its
tens
of
millions
of
animalcula
each
one
a
miniature
changed
in
color
from
inky
blackness
to
silver
sheen
will
the
ocean
take
to
itself
this
frail
foothold
we
queried
will
it
ingulf
us
in
its
insatiable
maw
as
the
whale
did
jonah
there
was
no
subsidence
no
pause
in
the
storm
it
howled
bellowed
and
screeched
like
a
legion
of
demons
so
that
the
crashing
of
falling
trees
and
the
twisting
of
the
sturdy
live
oak
toughest
limbs
could
hardly
be
heard
in
the
din
yet
during
this
wild
night
my
companion
sat
with
his
pretty
wife
by
the
open
fireplace
as
unmoved
as
though
we
were
in
the
shelter
of
a
mountain
side
while
he
calmly
discoursed
of
storms
shipwrecks
and
terrible
struggles
for
life
that
this
lonely
coast
had
witnessed
which
sent
thrills
of
horror
to
my
heart
while
traversing
the
beach
during
the
afternoon
as
wreck
after
wreck
the
gravestones
of
departed
ships
projected
their
timbers
from
the
sands
i
had
made
a
calculation
of
the
number
of
vessels
which
had
left
their
hulls
to
rot
on
hatteras
beach
since
the
ships
of
sir
walter
raleigh
had
anchored
above
the
cape
and
it
resulted
in
making
one
continuous
line
of
vessels
wreck
touching
wreck
along
the
coast
for
many
many
miles
hundreds
of
miles
of
the
atlantic
coast
beaches
would
have
been
walled
in
by
the
wrecks
could
they
have
come
on
to
the
strand
at
one
time
and
all
the
dwellers
along
the
coast
outside
of
the
towns
would
have
been
placed
in
independent
circumstances
by
wrecking
their
cargoes
during
this
wild
night
while
the
paper
canoe
was
safely
stowed
in
the
rushes
of
the
marsh
at
the
cape
and
its
owner
was
enjoying
the
warmth
of
the
young
astronomer
fire
at
the
inlet
less
than
twenty
miles
from
us
on
the
dangerous
edge
of
ocracoke
shoals
the
searching
party
of
the
yacht
julia
were
in
momentary
expectation
of
going
to
the
bottom
of
the
sound
for
hours
the
gallant
craft
hung
to
her
anchors
which
were
heavily
backed
by
all
the
iron
ballast
that
could
be
attached
to
the
cables
wave
after
wave
swept
over
her
and
not
a
man
could
put
his
head
above
the
hatches
then
as
she
rolled
in
the
sea
her
went
under
and
streams
of
water
were
forced
through
the
ports
into
the
confined
space
which
was
occupied
by
the
little
party
for
a
time
they
were
in
imminent
danger
for
the
vessel
dragged
anchor
to
the
edge
of
the
shoal
and
with
a
heavy
thud
the
yacht
struck
on
the
bottom
all
hopes
of
ever
returning
to
newbern
were
lost
when
the
changing
tide
swung
the
boat
off
into
deeper
water
where
she
rode
out
the
storm
in
safety
before
morning
the
wind
shifted
and
by
nine
i
retraced
my
steps
to
the
cape
and
on
tuesday
rowed
down
to
hatteras
inlet
which
was
reached
a
little
past
noon
before
attempting
to
cross
this
dangerous
tidal
of
the
ocean
i
hugged
the
shore
close
to
its
edge
and
paused
to
make
myself
familiar
with
the
sandhills
of
the
opposite
side
a
mile
away
which
were
to
serve
as
the
in
the
passage
how
often
had
i
lying
awake
at
night
thought
of
and
dreaded
the
crossing
of
this
inlet
it
had
given
me
much
mental
suffering
now
it
was
before
me
here
on
my
right
was
the
great
sound
on
my
left
the
narrow
beach
island
and
out
through
the
portal
of
the
open
inlet
surged
and
moaned
under
a
leaden
sky
that
old
ocean
which
now
seemed
to
frown
at
me
and
to
say
wait
my
boy
until
the
inlet
waves
deliver
you
to
me
and
i
will
put
you
among
my
other
victims
for
your
temerity
as
i
gazed
across
the
current
i
remarked
that
it
did
not
seem
very
rough
though
a
strong
ebb
was
running
out
to
the
sea
and
if
crossed
immediately
before
the
wind
arose
there
could
be
no
unreasonable
risk
my
canvas
was
carefully
pulled
close
about
my
waist
and
a
rigid
inspection
of
oars
and
was
made
then
with
a
desire
to
reserve
my
strength
for
any
great
demand
that
might
be
made
upon
it
a
little
later
i
rowed
with
a
steady
stroke
out
into
hatteras
inlet
there
was
no
help
nearer
than
styron
two
miles
away
on
the
upper
shore
while
the
beach
i
was
approaching
on
the
other
side
was
uninhabited
for
nearly
sixteen
miles
to
the
village
at
its
southern
end
near
ocracoke
inlet
upon
entering
the
swash
i
thought
of
the
sharks
which
the
hatteras
fishermen
had
told
me
frequently
seized
their
oars
snapping
the
thin
blades
in
pieces
assuring
me
at
the
same
time
that
mine
would
prove
very
attractive
being
so
white
and
glimmering
in
the
water
and
offering
the
same
glittering
fascination
as
a
bait
does
to
a
these
cheerful
suggestions
caused
a
peculiar
creeping
sensation
to
come
over
me
but
i
tried
to
quiet
myself
with
the
belief
that
the
sharks
had
followed
the
into
deeper
water
to
escape
cold
weather
the
canoe
crossed
the
upper
ebb
and
entered
an
area
where
the
ebb
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
inlet
struck
the
first
one
while
crossing
the
union
of
the
two
currents
a
wind
came
in
at
the
opening
through
the
beach
and
though
not
a
strong
one
it
created
a
great
agitation
of
the
water
the
dangerous
experience
at
watchapreague
inlet
had
taught
me
that
when
in
such
a
sea
one
must
pull
with
all
his
strength
and
that
the
increased
momentum
would
give
greater
buoyancy
to
the
shell
for
while
under
this
treatment
she
bounced
from
one
irregular
wave
to
another
with
a
climbing
action
which
greatly
relieved
my
anxiety
the
danger
seemed
to
be
decreasing
and
i
stole
a
furtive
glance
over
my
shoulder
at
the
low
dunes
of
the
beach
shore
which
i
was
approaching
to
see
how
far
into
the
inlet
the
tide
had
dragged
me
the
white
water
to
leeward
warned
me
of
a
shoal
and
forced
me
to
pull
hard
for
the
sound
to
escape
being
drawn
into
the
breakers
this
danger
was
hardly
passed
when
suddenly
the
waters
around
me
seethed
and
foamed
and
the
short
waves
parted
and
closed
as
great
creatures
rose
from
the
deep
into
the
air
several
feet
and
then
fell
heavily
into
the
sea
my
tiny
shell
rocked
and
pitched
about
wildly
as
these
animals
appeared
and
disappeared
leaping
from
the
waves
all
around
me
diving
under
the
boat
and
reappearing
on
the
opposite
side
they
lashed
the
current
with
their
strong
tails
and
snorted
or
blowed
most
dismally
for
an
instant
surprise
and
alarm
took
such
possession
of
me
that
not
a
muscle
of
my
arms
obeyed
my
will
and
the
canoe
commenced
to
drift
in
the
driving
stream
towards
the
open
sea
this
confusion
was
only
momentary
for
as
soon
as
i
discovered
that
my
companions
were
porpoises
and
only
old
acquaintances
i
determined
to
avoid
them
as
soon
as
possible
with
a
quick
glance
at
my
stern
range
a
sandhill
on
the
shore
of
the
inlet
and
another
look
over
my
shoulder
for
the
sand
dunes
of
the
other
side
i
exerted
every
muscle
to
reach
the
beach
but
my
frisky
friends
were
in
no
mood
to
leave
me
but
continued
their
fun
with
increased
energy
as
reinforcements
came
up
from
all
directions
the
faster
i
rowed
the
more
they
multiplied
ploughing
the
sea
in
erratic
courses
they
were
from
five
to
seven
feet
in
length
and
must
have
weighed
from
two
hundred
to
four
hundred
pounds
each
though
their
attentions
were
kindly
meant
their
brusqueness
on
such
an
unsteady
footing
was
unpardonable
i
most
feared
the
strong
shooting
movements
of
their
tails
in
the
sudden
dives
under
my
canoe
for
one
sportive
touch
of
such
a
caudality
would
have
rolled
me
over
and
furnished
material
for
a
tale
the
very
anticipation
of
which
was
unpleasant
crossing
hatteras
inlet
the
aquatic
gambols
of
the
porpoises
lasted
but
a
few
minutes
after
they
had
called
in
all
their
neighbors
and
had
chased
me
into
three
feet
depth
of
water
they
then
spouted
a
nasal
farewell
which
sounded
more
catarrhal
than
guitaral
and
left
me
for
the
more
profitable
occupation
of
fishing
in
the
of
the
inlet
while
i
rowed
into
a
shallow
cove
out
of
the
ebb
to
rest
and
to
recover
from
the
effects
of
my
fright
as
i
pulled
along
the
beach
the
tide
receded
so
rapidly
that
the
canoe
was
constantly
grounding
and
wading
became
necessary
for
i
could
not
get
within
several
feet
of
the
shore
when
five
miles
from
hatteras
inlet
i
espied
an
empty
grass
cabin
which
the
fishermen
used
in
february
while
catching
shad
and
as
a
southerly
wind
was
now
blowing
from
the
sea
and
rain
was
falling
it
offered
a
night
shelter
for
the
traveller
this
robinson
crusoe
looking
structure
was
located
upon
the
low
land
near
the
sound
while
bleak
treeless
and
grassless
sandhills
blown
into
shape
by
the
winds
arose
in
the
background
and
cut
off
a
view
of
the
ocean
which
judging
from
the
low
melancholy
moaning
coming
over
the
dunes
was
in
a
sad
mood
the
canoe
was
hauled
into
the
bushes
and
tied
securely
for
fear
a
deceptive
tide
might
bear
it
away
the
provisions
blankets
were
moved
into
the
grass
hut
which
needed
repairing
the
holes
in
the
south
wall
were
soon
thatched
and
a
bed
easily
prepared
from
the
rushes
of
the
marsh
it
mattered
not
that
they
were
wet
for
a
piece
of
painted
canvas
was
spread
over
them
and
the
inviting
couch
finished
as
fresh
water
can
usually
be
obtained
on
all
these
low
beaches
by
digging
two
or
three
feet
into
the
sand
i
looked
for
a
large
and
my
search
being
rewarded
i
was
soon
engaged
in
digging
a
well
near
the
cabin
upon
looking
up
from
my
work
a
curious
sight
met
my
gaze
in
some
mysterious
way
every
had
been
covered
by
a
black
object
which
swayed
about
and
nodded
up
and
down
in
a
strange
manner
as
i
watched
the
development
of
this
startling
phenomenon
the
nodding
black
objects
grew
in
size
until
the
head
body
and
four
legs
of
a
horse
were
clearly
cut
against
the
sky
a
little
later
every
crest
was
surmounted
by
the
comical
figure
of
a
then
a
few
sheep
came
out
of
the
hollows
among
the
hills
and
browsed
on
the
coarse
grass
near
the
cabin
as
though
they
felt
the
loneliness
of
their
situation
so
far
removed
from
mankind
with
the
the
sheep
the
of
the
sound
and
the
sighing
sea
for
companions
the
night
passed
away
the
bright
moonlight
roused
me
at
five
in
the
morning
and
i
pushed
off
again
in
shoal
water
on
an
experiencing
much
difficulty
in
dragging
the
canoe
over
shallow
places
until
deep
water
was
entered
when
the
row
to
ocracoke
became
an
agreeable
one
the
at
ocracoke
not
far
from
the
lighthouse
was
reached
at
noon
and
the
people
gathered
to
see
the
paper
boat
having
been
notified
of
my
proximity
by
fishermen
the
women
here
can
pull
a
pretty
good
stroke
and
frequently
assist
their
husbands
in
the
fisheries
these
old
dames
ridiculed
the
idea
of
having
a
boat
so
small
and
light
as
the
canoe
one
old
lady
laid
aside
her
pipe
and
is
a
institution
in
the
south
and
roughly
grasping
the
bow
of
the
craft
lifted
it
high
in
the
air
then
glancing
at
the
fine
model
she
lowered
it
slowly
to
the
ground
exclaiming
i
reckon
i
risk
my
life
acrossing
a
creek
in
her
these
people
told
me
that
the
yacht
julia
had
stopped
there
to
make
inquiries
for
me
and
had
departed
for
newbern
it
was
more
than
a
mile
from
the
landing
to
ocracoke
inlet
and
a
mile
and
three
quarters
across
it
to
the
beach
a
straight
course
from
the
landing
to
the
village
of
portsmouth
on
the
lower
side
of
the
inlet
was
a
distance
of
five
miles
and
not
one
of
the
hardy
watermen
who
thumped
the
sides
of
my
boat
with
their
hard
fists
to
ascertain
its
strength
believed
that
i
could
cross
the
sound
to
the
other
village
without
rolling
over
one
oysterman
offered
to
carry
myself
and
boat
to
portsmouth
but
as
the
day
was
calm
i
rowed
away
on
the
stretch
amid
doleful
prognostications
such
as
that
feller
will
make
a
coffin
for
hisself
out
of
that
yere
gimcrack
of
an
it
all
a
man
life
is
wurth
to
go
in
her
while
approaching
the
low
portsmouth
shore
of
the
sound
flocks
of
canada
geese
flew
within
of
my
head
a
man
in
a
canoe
told
me
that
the
gunners
of
the
village
had
reared
from
the

a
flock
of
wild
geese
which
now
aggregated
some
seven
or
eight
hundred
birds
and
that
these
now
flying
about
were
used
to
decoy
their
wild
relatives
near
the
beach
a
sandy
hill
had
been
the
place
of
sepulture
for
the
inhabitants
of
other
generations
but
for
years
past
the
tidal
current
had
been
cutting
the
shore
away
until
coffin
after
coffin
with
its
contents
had
been
washed
into
the
sound
captain
isaac
jennings
of
ocean
county
new
jersey
had
described
this
spot
to
me
as
follows
i
landed
at
portsmouth
and
examined
this
curious
here
by
the
water
were
the
remains
of
the
fathers
mothers
brothers
and
sisters
of
the
people
of
the
village
so
near
at
hand
yet
these
dismal
relics
of
their
ancestors
were
allowed
to
be
stolen
away
piecemeal
by
the
encroaching
ocean
while
i
gazed
sadly
upon
the
strata
of
coffins
protruding
from
the
banks
shining
objects
like
jewels
seemed
to
be
sparkling
from
between
the
cracks
of
their
fractured
sides
and
as
i
tore
away
the
rotten
wood
rows
of
toads
were
discovered
sitting
in
solemn
council
their
bright
eyes
peering
from
among
the
debris
of
bones
and
decomposed
substances
portsmouth
island
is
nearly
eight
miles
long
whalebone
inlet
is
at
its
lower
end
but
is
too
shallow
to
be
of
any
service
to
commerce
hatteras
and
ocracoke
inlets
admit
vessels
it
is
miles
from
whalebone
inlet
to
cape
lookout
which
projects
like
a
wedge
into
the
sea
nearly
three
miles
from
the
mainland
and
there
is
not
another
passage
through
the
narrow
beach
in
all
that
distance
that
is
of
any
use
to
the
mariner
following
the
trend
of
the
coast
for
eleven
miles
from
the
point
of
cape
lookout
there
is
an
inlet
but
from
the
character
of
its
channel
and
its
shallowness
it
is
not
of
much
value
leaving
portsmouth
the
canoe
entered
core
sound
which
grew
narrower
as
the
shoals
inside
of
whalebone
inlet
were
crossed
partly
by
rowing
and
partly
by
wading
on
the
as
night
came
on
a
barren
stretch
of
beach
on
my
left
hand
was
followed
until
i
espied
the
only
house
within
a
distance
of
sixteen
miles
along
the
sea
it
was
occupied
by
a
coasting
skipper
whose
fine
little
schooner
was
anchored
a
long
distance
from
the
land
on
account
of
the
shoalness
of
the
water
dreary
protected
the
cottage
from
the
bleak
winds
of
the
ocean
while
yet
a
long
distance
from
the
home
a
black
object
could
be
seen
crawling
up
the
sides
of
a
mound
of
white
sand
and
after
it
reached
the
apex
it
remained
in
one
position
while
i
rowed
and
waded
and
pulled
my
canoe
towards
the
shore
when
the
goal
was
reached
and
the
boat
was
landed
high
up
among
the
scrub
growth
i
shouldered
my
blankets
and
charts
and
plodded
through
the
soft
soil
towards
the
dark
object
which
i
now
recognized
to
be
a
man
on
a
lookout
post
he
did
not
move
from
his
position
until
i
reached
the
hillock
when
he
suddenly
slid
down
the
bank
and
landed
at
my
feet
with
a
cheery
well
now
i
thought
it
was
you
sez
i
to
myself
that
him
sure
when
i
seed
you
four
miles
away
fust
thinks
i
it
only
a
log
or
a
piece
of
afloating
pretty
soon
up
comes
your
head
and
shoulders
into
sight
then
sez
i
it
a
man
sure
but
where
is
his
boat
for
you
see
i
could
see
your
boat
it
was
so
low
down
in
the
water
then
i
reckoned
it
was
a
man
afloating
on
a
log
but
arter
a
while
the
boat
loomed
up
too
and
i
says
i
be
if
that
is
him
i
went
up
to
newbern
some
time
ago
in
the
schooner
and
the
people
there
said
there
was
a
man
coming
down
the
coast
a
paper
boat
on
a
bet
the
boat
weighed
only
pounds
and
the
man
had
a
heft
of
only
eighty
pounds
when
pa
and
me
went
up
to
the
city
agin
the
folks
said
the
man
was
close
on
to
us
and
this
time
they
said
the
man
and
his
boat
together
weighed
only
eighty
pounds
now
i
should
think
you
weighed
more
than
that
yourself
letting
alone
the
boat
having
assured
the
young
man
that
i
was
indeed
myself
and
that
the
newbern
people
had
played
upon
his
credulity
we
walked
on
to
the
house
where
the
family
of
captain
james
mason
kindly
welcomed
me
to
a
glowing
and
hearty
supper
though
i
had
never
heard
of
their
existence
till
i
entered
core
sound
the
kindness
of
these
people
was
like
that
of
old
friends
half
a
mile
below
captain
mason
home
a
short
time
before
my
visit
a
new
breach
had
been
made
by
the
ocean
through
the
beach
about
twenty
years
before
a
similar
breach
had
occurred
in
the
same
locality
and
was
known
during
its
short
life
as
pillintary
inlet
the
next
day
i
crossed
the
sound
which
is
here
four
miles
in
width
and
coasted
along
to
the
oystermen
village
of
hunting
quarters
on
the
mainland
the
houses
were
very
small
but
the
hearts
of
the
poor
folks
were
very
large
they
came
to
the
water
edge
and
carried
the
canoe
into
the
only
store
in
the
neighborhood
its
proprietor
william
stewart
insisted
upon
my
sharing
his
bachelor
quarters
in
an
unfinished
room
of
the
storehouse
my
young
host
was
hardly
out
of
his
teens
in
his
boyish
way
he
kindly
remarked
i
am
here
all
alone
father
told
me
before
he
died
never
to
let
a
stranger
pass
my
door
but
to
make
him
share
my
lodgings
humble
though
they
are
and
now
any
way
you
just
in
time
for
the
fun
for
we
are
to
have
three
weddings
and
all
the
boys
and
girls
of
the
neighborhood
will
be
at
hunting
quarters
i
entered
a
mild
protest
against
joining
in
the
festivities
on
the
plea
of
not
having
received
an
invitation
at
which
the
handsome
youth
laughed
heartily
invitation
he
exclaimed
why
no
one
ever
gives
out
invitations
in
hunting
quarters
when
there
is
to
be
a
of
any
sort
everybody
goes
to
the
house
without
being
asked
you
see
we
are
all
neighbors
here
up
at
newbern
and
at
beaufort
and
other
great
cities
people
have
their
ways
but
here
all
are
friends
so
we
went
to
the
little
house
in
the
piny
forest
where
two
hearts
were
to
be
made
one
the
only
room
on
the
first
floor
was
crowded
with
people
the
minister
had
not
arrived
and
the
crowd
was
gazing
at
the
young
groom
and
his
pretty
as
they
sat
in
two
chairs
in
the
middle
of
the
company
with
their
arms
around
each
other
never
speaking
a
word
to
any
one
the
heavy
weight
of
people
began
to
settle
the
floor
and
as
two
joists
gave
way
i
struggled
to
escape
through
an
open
window
thinking
we
would
be
precipitated
into
the
cellar
below
but
the
company
took
no
notice
of
the
snapping
timbers
only
ejaculating
soon
touch
bottom
and
to
my
inquiries
about
the
inconvenience
of
being
pitched
through
to
the
cellar
a
rustic
youth
with
great
merriment
depicted
upon
his
countenance
replied
sullers
captain
why
there
ai
a
suller
to
a
buildin
within
thirty
miles
of
the
quarters
we
never
uses
sullers
hereabouts
by
my
side
was
a
young
fisherman
who
had
got
home
from
a
cruise
and
was
overflowing
with
affection
towards
every
girl
present
o
gals
he
would
cry
you
do
know
how
nice
i
feels
to
get
back
to
you
once
more
throwing
his
arms
around
a
girl
who
vainly
tried
to
escape
him
he
said
o
weary
mariner
here
is
thy
rest
no
more
shall
he
wander
from
thee
this
sentimental
strain
was
interrupted
by
an
old
lady
who
reached
her
arm
over
my
shoulder
to
administer
a
rebuke
sam
ye
a
fool
she
cried
ye
beside
yourself
and
afore
this
captain
too
ef
i
was
a
gal
i
drap
yere
society
wid
yere
familiar
ways
right
in
company
the
blow
and
the
admonition
fell
harmlessly
upon
the
head
and
the
heart
of
the
sailor
who
replied
aunty
i
knows
my
advantages
in
hunting
quarters
women
is
plenty
and
men
is
few
the
crowd
roared
with
laughter
at
this
truism
but
were
quieted
by
the
shout
of
a
boy
that
the
preacher
was
whereupon
the
reverend
gentleman
elbowed
his
way
through
the
guests
to
the
quiet
couple
and
requested
them
to
stand
up
a
few
hurried
words
by
the
clergyman
a
few
bashful
replies
from
the
young
people
and
the
two
were
made
one
the
crowd
rushed
outside
of
the
house
where
a
general
scramble
took
place
among
the
boys
for
their
girls
then
a
procession
was
formed
headed
by
the
clergyman
which
marched
along
the
sandy
road
to
another
house
in
the
woods
where
the
second
marriage
was
to
be
celebrated
it
was
amusing
to
see
the
young
men
dash
away
from
the
procession
to
run
to
the
village
store
for
candy
at
cents
per
pound
containing
as
much
terra
alba
white
clay
as
sugar
with
pockets
they
would
run
back
to
the
procession
and
fill
the
girls
aprons
with
the
sweets
soon
repeating
the
process
and
showering
upon
the
fair
ones
cakes
raisins
nuts
and
oranges
the
only
young
man
who
seemed
to
find
no
favor
in
any
woman
eyes
invested
more
capital
in
sweetmeats
than
the
others
and
though
every
girl
in
the
procession
gave
him
a
sharp
word
or
a
kick
as
he
passed
yet
none
refused
his
candies
as
he
tossed
them
at
the
maidens
or
stuffed
them
into
the
pockets
of
their
dresses
the
second
ceremony
was
performed
in
about
three
minutes
and
the
preacher
feeling
faint
from
his
long
ride
through
the
woods
declared
he
must
have
some
supper
so
while
he
was
being
served
the
girls
chatted
together
the
old
ladies
helped
each
other
to
snuff
with
little
wooden
paddles
which
were
left
protruding
from
one
corner
of
their
mouths
after
they
had
taken
a
dip
as
they
called
it
the
boys
after
learning
that
the
preacher
had
postponed
the
third
marriage
for
an
hour
with
a
wild
shout
scampered
off
to
stewart
store
for
more
candies
i
took
advantage
of
the
interim
to
inquire
how
it
was
that
the
young
ladies
and
gentlemen
were
upon
such
terms
of
pleasant
intimacy
well
captain
replied
the
person
interrogated
you
sees
we
is
all
growed
up
together
and
brotherly
love
and
sisterly
affection
is
our
teaching
the
brethren
love
the
sisteren
and
they
say
that
love
begets
love
so
the
sisteren
loves
the
brethren
it
parfecly
nateral
the
hull
story
captain
how
is
it
up
your
way
at
last
the
preacher
declared
himself
satisfied
with
all
he
had
eaten
and
that
enough
was
as
good
as
a
feast
so
the
young
people
fell
into
line
and
we
trudged
to
the
third
house
where
with
the
same
dispatch
the
third
couple
were
united
then
the
fiddler
scraped
the
strings
of
his
instrument
and
a
dance
commenced
the
girls
stamped
and
moved
their
feet
about
in
the
same
manner
as
the
men
soon
four
or
five
of
the
young
ladies
left
the
and
seated
themselves
in
a
corner
pouting
discontentedly
my
companion
explained
to
me
that
the
deserters
were
a
little
having
made
two
or
three
visits
on
a
schooner
to
the
city
newbern
where
they
had
other
ways
of
dancing
and
where
the
folks
did
think
it
pretty
for
a
girl
to
strike
her
heels
upon
the
floor
how
long
they
danced
i
know
not
for
the
prospect
of
a
long
row
on
the
morrow
sent
me
to
rest
in
the
storehouse
from
which
i
was
called
by
a
kind
old
couple
sending
for
me
to
take
tea
with
them
at
half
an
hour
after
midnight
unwilling
to
wound
the
sensitive
feelings
of
these
hospitable
people
i
answered
the
summons
in
propia
persona
and
found
it
was
the
mother
of
bride
no
to
whom
i
was
indebted
for
the
invitation
a
table
took
up
the
space
in
the
centre
of
the
room
where
a
few
hours
before
the
timbers
creaked
beneath
the
weight
of
the
curious
crowd
and
there
sitting
on
one
side
in
the
same
affectionate
manner
i
have
described
were
the
bride
and
groom
apparently
unmoved
by
the
change
of
scene
while
the
bride
mother
rocked
in
her
chair
moaning
o
john
if
you
taken
the
other
gal
i
might
have
stood
it
but
this
yere
one
has
been
my
comfort
at
dawn
the
canoe
was
put
into
core
sound
and
i
followed
the
western
shore
cheered
by
the
bright
sun
of
our
saviour
natal
day
at
noon
the
mouth
of
the
thoroughfare
between
island
and
the
mainland
was
unintentionally
passed
and
i
rowed
along
by
the
side
of
the
island
next
fort
macon
which
is
inside
of
the
angle
made
by
cape
lookout
finding
it
impossible
to
reach
newbern
via
morehead
city
that
day
the
canoe
was
beached
upon
the
end
of
harker
island
where
i
breakfasted
at
the
fashionable
hour
of
two
with
men
women
and
children
around
me
my
mode
of
cooking
the
condensed
food
and
liquid
beef
so
quickly
prepared
for
the
palate
and
the
remarkable
boat
of
paper
all
filled
the
islanders
with
wonder
they
were
at
first
a
little
shy
looking
upon
the
apparition
which
seemed
in
some
wonderful
way
to
have
dropped
upon
their
beach
with
the
light
of
curiosity
in
their
eyes
then
as
i
explained
the
many
uses
to
which
paper
was
put
even
to
the
paying
off
of
great
national
debts
my
audience
became
very
friendly
and
offered
to
get
me
up
a
christmas
dinner
in
their
cabins
among
the
groves
of
trees
near
the
strand
if
i
would
tarry
with
them
until
night
but
time
was
precious
so
with
thanks
on
my
part
for
their
kind
offers
we
parted
they
helping
me
launch
my
little
boat
and
waving
a
cheerful
adieu
as
i
headed
the
canoe
for
beaufort
which
was
quietly
passed
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
three
miles
further
on
the
railroad
pier
of
morehead
city
in
bogue
sound
was
reached
and
a
crowd
of
people
carried
the
canoe
into
the
hotel
a
telegram
was
soon
received
from
the
superintendent
of
the
railroad
at
newbern
inviting
me
to
a
free
ride
to
the
city
in
the
first
train
of
the
following
morning
the
reader
who
has
followed
me
since
i
left
the
chilly
regions
of
the
lawrence
must
not
have
his
patience
taxed
by
too
much
detail
lest
he
should
weary
of
my
story
and
desert
my
company
were
it
not
for
this
fear
it
would
give
me
pleasure
to
tell
how
a
week
was
passed
in
newbern
how
the
people
came
even
from
interior
towns
to
see
the
paper
canoe
how
some
doubting
my
veracity
slyly
stuck
the
blades
of
their
through
the
thin
sides
of
the
canoe
forgetting
that
it
had
yet
to
traverse
many
dangerous
inlets
and
that
its
owner
preferred
a
tight
dry
boat
to
one
punctured
by
knives
even
old
men
became
enthusiastic
and
when
i
was
absent
from
my
little
craft
an
uncontrollable
ambition
seized
them
and
they
got
into
the
frail
shell
as
it
rested
upon
the
floor
of
a
hall
and
threatened
its
destruction
it
seemed
impossible
to
make
one
gentleman
of
newbern
understand
that
when
the
boat
was
in
the
water
she
was
resting
upon
all
her
bearings
but
when
out
of
water
only
upon
a
thin
strip
of
wood
by
george
said
this
stout
gentleman
in
a
whisper
to
a
friend
i
told
my
wife
i
would
get
into
that
boat
if
i
smashed
it
and
what
did
the
lady
say
old
fellow
asked
the
friend
o
he
replied
she
said
do
make
a
fool
of
yourself
fatness
or
your
ambition
may
get
you
into
the
papers
and
the
speaker
fairly
shook
with
laughter
while
at
newbern
judge
west
and
his
brother
organized
a
grand
hunt
and
the
railroad
company
sent
us
down
the
road
eighteen
miles
to
a
wild
district
where
deer
coons
and
were
plentiful
and
where
we
hunted
all
night
for
coons
and
ducks
and
all
day
for
deer
under
these
genial
influences
the
practical
study
of
geography
for
the
first
time
seemed
dull
and
i
became
aware
that
under
the
efforts
of
the
citizens
of
newbern
to
remind
me
of
the
charms
of
civilized
society
i
was
as
a
travelling
geographer
fast
becoming
demoralized
could
i
after
the
many
pleasures
i
was
daily
enjoying
settle
down
to
a
steady
pull
and
one
meal
a
day
with
a
lunch
of
dry
crackers
or
sleep
on
the
floor
of
fishermen
cabins
with
fleas
and
other
little
annoyances
attendant
thereon
having
realized
my
position
i
tore
myself
away
from
my
many
new
friends
and
retraced
my
steps
to
morehead
city
leaving
it
on
tuesday
january
and
rowing
down
the
little
sound
called
bogue
towards
cape
fear
as
night
came
on
i
discovered
on
the
shore
a
grass
cabin
which
was
on
the
plantation
of
emmett
and
had
been
left
tenantless
by
some
fisherman
this
served
for
shelter
during
the
night
though
the
struggles
and
squealings
of
a
drove
of
hogs
attempting
to
enter
through
the
rickety
door
did
not
contribute
much
to
my
repose
the
watercourses
now
became
more
intricate
growing
narrower
as
i
rowed
southward
the
open
waters
of
the
sound
were
left
behind
and
i
entered
a
labyrinth
of
creeks
and
small
sheets
of
water
which
form
a
network
in
the
marshes
between
the
sandy
and
the
mainland
all
the
way
to
cape
fear
river
the
core
sound
sheet
of
the
united
states
coast
survey
ended
at
cape
lookout
there
being
no
charts
of
the
route
to
masonboro
i
was
therefore
now
travelling
upon
local
knowledge
which
proves
usually
a
very
uncertain
guide
in
a
cold
rain
the
canoe
reached
the
little
village
of
swansboro
where
the
chief
personage
of
the
place
of
two
hundred
inhabitants
mclain
removed
me
from
my
temporary
in
an
old
house
near
the
turpentine
distilleries
into
his
own
comfortable
quarters
there
are
twenty
mullet
fisheries
within
ten
miles
of
swansboro
which
employ
from
fifteen
to
eighteen
men
each
the
pickled
and
dried
roe
of
this
fish
is
shipped
to
wilmington
and
to
cincinnati
abound
and
the
shooting
is
excellent
the
fishermen
say
flocks
of
ducks
seven
miles
in
length
have
been
seen
on
the
waters
of
bogue
sound
are
called
here
and
they
sell
from
twelve
to
twenty
cents

wild
geese
bring
forty
cents
and
brant
thirty
the
feed
upon
the
beaches
in
a
half
wild
state
with
the
deer
and
cattle
cross
the
marshes
and
swim
the
streams
from
the
mainland
to
the
beaches
in
the
spring
and
graze
there
until
winter
when
they
collect
in
little
herds
and
instinctively
return
to
the
piny
woods
of
the
uplands
messrs
weeks
and
taylor
had
shot
while
on
a
hunt
up
the
white

river
twenty
deer
captain
heady
of
swansboro
informed
me
that
the
ducks
and
geese
he
killed
in
one
winter
supplied
him
with
one
hundred
pounds
of
selected
feathers
captain
heady
description
of
bogue
inlet
was
not
encouraging
for
the
future
prosperity
of
this
coast
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
all
the
inlets
between
it
and
cape
fear
rainy
weather
kept
me
within
doors
until
friday
the
of
january
when
i
rowed
down
white
oak
river
to
bogue
inlet
and
turned
into
the
beach
thoroughfare
which
led
me
three
miles
and
a
half
to
bear
inlet
my
course
now
lay
through
creeks
among
the
marshes
to
the
near
the
mainland
where
the
tides
between
the
two
inlets
head
across
this
shoal
spot
i
traversed
tortuous
watercourses
with
mud
flats
from
which
beds
of
sharp
raccoon
oysters
projected
and
scraped
the
keel
of
my
boat
the
sea
was
now
approached
from
the
mainland
to
brown
inlet
where
the
tide
ran
like
a
swinging
my
canoe
in
great
circles
as
i
crossed
it
to
the
lower
side
here
i
took
the
widest
thoroughfare
and
left
the
beach
only
to
retrace
my
steps
to
follow
one
nearer
the
strand
which
conducted
me
to
the
end
of
the
natural
system
of
watercourses
where
i
found
a
ditch
dug
seventy
years
before
which
connected
the
last
system
of
waters
with
another
series
of
creeks
that
emptied
their
waters
into
new
river
inlet
emerging
from
the
marshes
my
course
led
me
away
from
new
river
inlet
across
open
sheets
of
water
to
the
mainland
where
ward
cotton
plantation
occupied
a
large
and
cultivated
area
in
the
wilderness
it
was
nearly
two
miles
from
his
estate
down
to
the
inlet
the
intervening
flats
among
the
island
marshes
of
new
river
were
covered
with
natural
beds
of
oysters
upon
which
the
canoe
scraped
as
i
crossed
to
the
narrow
entrance
of
stump
sound
upon
rounding
a
point
of
land
i
found
snugly
ensconced
in
a
grove
the
cot
of
an
oysterman
captain
risley
lewis
who
after
informing
me
that
his
was
the
last
habitation
to
be
found
in
that
vicinity
pressed
me
to
be
his
guest
the
next
day
proved
one
of
trial
to
patience
and
muscle
the
narrow
watercourses
which
like
a
spider
web
penetrate
the
marshes
with
numerous
small
sheets
of
water
made
travelling
a
most
difficult
task
at
times
i
was
lost
again
my
canoe
was
lodged
upon
in
the
shallow
ponds
of
water
the
mud
bottoms
of
which
would
not
hear
my
weight
if
i
attempted
to
get
overboard
to
lighten
the
little
craft
alligator
lake
two
miles
in
width
was
crossed
without
seeing
an
alligator
saurians
are
first
met
with
as
the
traveller
proceeds
south
in
the
vicinity
of
alligator
creek
and
the
neuse
river
in
the
latitude
of
pamplico
sound
during
the
cold
weather
they
hide
themselves
in
the
soft
muddy
bottoms
of
creeks
and
lagoons
all
the
negroes
and
many
of
the
white
people
of
the
south
assert
that
when
captured
in
his
winter
bed
this
huge
reptile
stomach
contains
the
hard
knot
of
a
but
for
what
purpose
he
swallows
it
they
are
at
a
loss
to
explain
in
twelve
miles
of
tortuous
windings
there
appeared
but
one
sign
of
human
life
a
little
cabin
on
a
ridge
of
upland
among
the
fringe
of
marshes
that
bordered
on
alligator
lake
it
was
cheering
to
a
lonely
canoeist
to
see
this
house
and
the
clearing
around
it
with
the
season
crop
of
corn
in
stacks
dotting
the
field
all
this
region
is
called
stump
sound
but
that
sheet
of
water
is
a
narrow
watercourse
which
was
entered
not
long
after
i
debouched
from
alligator
lake
stump
inlet
having
closed
up
eighteen
months
before
my
visit
the
sound
and
its
tributaries
received
tidal
water
from
new
topsail
inlet
it
was
a
cold
and
rainy
evening
when
i
sought
shelter
in
an
old
at
a
landing
on
topsail
sound
soon
after
leaving
stump
sound
while
preparing
for
the
night
camp
the
son
of
the
proprietor
of
the
plantation
discovered
the
to
him
spectacle
of
a
paper
boat
upon
the
gravelly
strand
filled
with
curiosity
and
delight
he
dragged
me
paddle
in
hand
through
an
avenue
of
trees
to
a
hill
upon
which
a
large
house
was
located
this
was
the
home
leaving
me
on
the
broad
steps
of
the
veranda
he
rushed
into
the
hall
shouting
to
the
family
here
a
sailor
who
has
come
from
the
north
in
a
paper
boat
this
piece
of
intelligence
roused
the
good
people
to
merriment
impossible
a
boat
made
of
paper
nonsense
the
boy
however
would
not
be
put
down
but
it
is
made
of
paper
i
tell
you
for
i
pinched
it
and
stuck
my
nails
into
it
he
replied
earnestly
you
are
crazy
my
boy
some
one
responded
a
paper
boat
never
could
go
through
these
sounds
the
coon
oysters
would
cut
it
in
pieces
now
tell
us
is
the
sailor
made
of
paper
like
his
boat
indeed
mother
what
i
tell
you
is
true
and
o
i
forgot
here
the
sailor
on
the
steps
where
i
left
him
in
an
instant
the
whole
family
were
out
upon
the
veranda
seeing
my
embarrassment
they
tried
like
people
to
check
their
merriment
while
i
explained
to
them
the
way
in
which
the
boy
had
captured
me
and
proposed
at
once
returning
to
my
camp
to
this
however
they
would
not
listen
and
the
charming
wife
of
the
planter
extended
her
hand
to
me
as
she
said
no
sir
you
will
not
go
back
to
the
wet
landing
to
camp
this
is
our
home
and
though
marauding
armies
during
the
late
war
have
taken
from
us
our
wealth
you
must
share
with
us
the
little
we
have
left
this
lady
with
her
two
daughters
who
inherited
her
beauty
and
grace
of
manner
did
all
in
their
power
to
make
me
comfortable
sunday
was
the
coldest
day
of
the
season
but
the
family
whose
hospitality
i
enjoyed
rode
seven
miles
through
the
woods
some
on
horseback
some
in
the
carriage
to
the
little
church
in
a
heavy
pine
forest
the
next
day
proved
stormy
and
the
driving
sleet
froze
upon
the
trees
and
bound
their
limbs
and
boughs
together
with
an
icy
veneer
my
host
mcmillan
kindly
urged
me
to
tarry
during
my
stay
with
him
i
ascertained
that
he
devoted
his
attention
to
raising
or
peanuts
along
the
coast
of
this
part
of
north
carolina
this
nut
is
the
chief
product
and
is
raised
in
immense
quantities
the
latter
state
alone
raises
annually
over
one
hundred
thousand
bushels
while
virginia
and
tennessee
produce
some
years
a
crop
of
seven
hundred
thousand
bushels
wednesday
opened
with
partially
clearing
weather
and
the
icy
covering
of
the
trees
yielded
to
the
softening
influences
of
a
southern
wind
the
family
went
to
the
landing
to
see
me
off
and
the
kind
ladies
stowed
many
delicacies
made
with
their
own
hands
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
after
rowing
a
i
took
a
lingering
look
at
the
shore
where
those
who
four
days
ago
were
strangers
now
waved
an
adieu
as
friends
they
had
been
stript
of
their
wealth
though
the
kind
old
planter
had
never
raised
his
hand
against
the
government
of
his
fathers
this
family
like
thousands
of
people
in
the
south
had
suffered
for
the
rash
deeds
of
others
while
the
political
views
of
this
gentleman
differed
from
those
of
the
stranger
from
massachusetts
it
formed
no
barrier
to
their
social
intercourse
and
did
not
make
him
forget
to
exhibit
the
warm
feelings
of
hospitality
which
so
largely
influence
the
southerner
i
went
to
him
as
a
traveller
in
search
of
truth
upon
an
honest
errand
under
such
circumstances
a
northerner
does
not
require
a
letter
of
introduction
to
nine
out
of
ten
of
the
citizens
of
the
fifteen
states
which
cover
an
area
of
eight
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
square
miles
and
where
fourteen
millions
of
people
desire
to
be
permitted
to
enjoy
the
same
privileges
as
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
guarantees
to
all
the
states
north
of
mason
and
dixon
line
from
sloop
landing
on
my
new
plantation
to
new
topsail
inlet
i
had
a
brisk
row
of
five
miles
vessels
drawing
eight
feet
of
water
can
reach
this
landing
from
the
open
sea
upon
a
full
tide
the
sea
was
rolling
in
at
this
ocean
door
as
my
canoe
crossed
it
to
the
next
marsh
thoroughfare
which
connected
it
with
old
topsail
inlet
where
the
same
monotonous
surroundings
of
and
marshes
are
to
be
found
the
next
tidal
opening
was
rich
inlet
which
had
a
strong
ebb
running
through
it
to
the
sea
from
it
i
threaded
the
thoroughfares
up
to
the
mainland
reaching
at
dusk
the
emma
nickson
plantation
the
creeks
were
growing
more
shallow
and
near
the
bulkhead
or
middleground
where
tides
from
two
inlets
met
there
was
so
little
water
and
so
many
oyster
reefs
that
without
a
chart
the
route
grew
more
and
more
perplexing
in
character
it
was
a
distance
of
thirty
miles
to
cape
fear
and
twenty
miles
to
new
inlet
which
was
one
of
the
mouths
of
cape
fear
river
from
the
plantation
to
new
inlet
the
shallow
interior
sheets
of
water
with
their
marshes
were
called
middle
masonboro
and
myrtle
sounds
the
canoe
could
have
traversed
these
waters
to
the
end
of
myrtle
sound
which
is
separated
from
cape
fear
river
by
a
strip
of
land
only
one
mile
and
a
half
wide
across
which
a
portage
can
be
made
to
the
river
barren
and
masonboro
are
the
only
inlets
which
supply
the
three
little
sounds
above
mentioned
with
water
after
rich
inlet
is
passed
the
coast
from
cape
fear
southward
eighty
miles
to
georgetown
south
carolina
has
several
small
inlets
through
the
beach
but
there
are
no
interior
waters
parallel
with
the
coast
in
all
that
distance
which
can
be
of
any
service
to
the
canoeist
for
a
coast
route
it
therefore
became
necessary
for
me
to
follow
the
next
watercourse
that
could
be
utilized
for
reaching
winyah
bay
which
is
the
first
entrance
to
the
system
of
continuous
watercourses
south
of
cape
fear
the
trees
of
the
nickson
plantation
hid
the
house
of
the
proprietor
from
view
but
upon
beaching
my
canoe
a
drove
of
hogs
greeted
me
with
friendly
grunts
as
if
the
hospitality
of
their
master
infected
the
drove
and
as
it
grew
dark
they
trotted
across
the
field
conducting
me
up
to
the
very
doors
of
the
planter
home
where
captain
mosely
late
of
the
confederate
army
gave
me
a
soldier
hearty
welcome
the
war
is
over
he
said
and
any
northern
gentleman
is
welcome
to
what
we
have
left
until
midnight
this
intelligent
officer
entertained
me
with
a
flow
of
anecdotes
of
the
war
times
his
escapes
the
conversation
being
only
interrupted
when
he
paused
to
pile
wood
upon
the
fire
the
meantime
glowing
like
a
furnace
he
told
me
that
captain
maffitt
of
the
late
confederate
navy
lived
at
masonboro
on
the
sound
and
that
had
i
called
upon
him
he
could
have
furnished
as
an
old
officer
of
the
coast
survey
much
valuable
geographical
information
this
pleasant
conversation
was
at
last
interrupted
by
the
wife
of
my
host
who
warned
us
in
her
courteous
way
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
with
a
to
my
host
and
a
sad
farewell
to
the

the
lake
to
my
point
of
departure
it
was
now
noon
and
our
little
party
picnicked
under
the
lofty
trees
which
rise
from
the
low
shores
of
lake
waccamaw
a
little
later
we
said
our
adieu
and
the
paper
canoe
shot
into
the
whirling
current
which
rushes
out
of
the
lake
through
a
narrow
aperture
into
a
great
and
dismal
swamp
before
leaving
the
party
carroll
had
handed
me
a
letter
addressed
to
hall
who
was
in
charge
of
a
turpentine
distillery
on
my
route
it
is
twenty
miles
by
the
river
to
my
friend
hall
he
said
but
in
a
straight
line
the
place
is
just
four
miles
from
here
such
is
the
character
of
the
waccamaw
this
most
crooked
of
rivers
i
had
never
been
on
so
rapid
and
continuous
a
current
as
it
whirled
me
along
the
narrow
watercourse
i
was
compelled
to
abandon
my
oars
and
use
the
paddle
in
order
to
have
my
face
to
the
bow
as
the
abrupt
turns
of
the
stream
seemed
to
wall
me
in
on
every
side
down
the
tortuous
black
rolling
current
went
the
paper
canoe
with
a
giant
forest
covering
the
great
swamp
and
screening
me
from
the
light
of
day
the
swamps
were
submerged
and
as
the
water
poured
out
of
the
thickets
into
the
river
it
would
shoot
across
the
land
from
one
bend
to
another
presenting
in
places
the
mystifying
spectacle
of
water
running
up
stream
but
not
up
an
inclined
plain
festoons
of
gray
spanish
moss
hung
from
the
weird
limbs
of
monster
trees
giving
a
funeral
aspect
to
the
gloomy
forest
while
the
owls
hooted
as
though
it
were
night
the
creamy
berries
of
the
mistletoe
gave
a
druidical
aspect
to
the
woods
for
this
parasite
grew
upon
the
branches
of
many
trees
one
spot
only
of
firm
land
rose
from
the
water
in
sixteen
miles
of
paddling
from
the
lake
and
passing
it
i
went
flying
on
with
the
turbulent
stream
four
miles
further
to
where
rafts
of
logs
blocked
the
river
and
the
sandy
banks
covered
with
the
upland
forest
of
pines
encroached
upon
the
lowlands
this
was
old
dock
with
its
turpentine
distillery
smoking
and
sending
out
resinous
vapors
young
hall
read
my
letter
and
invited
me
to
his
temporary
home
which
though
roughly
built
of
unplaned
boards
possessed
two
comfortable
rooms
and
a
large
fireplace
in
which
the
terebinthine
heart
of
the
was
cheerfully
blazing
i
had
made
the
twenty
miles
in
three
hours
but
the
credit
of
this
quick
time
must
be
given
to
the
rapid
current
my
host
did
not
seem
well
pleased
with
the
solitude
imposed
upon
him
his
employers
had
sent
him
from
wilmington
to
hold
and
protect
their
turpentine
farm
which
was
a
wilderness
of
trees
covering
four
thousand
acres
and
was
valued
with
its
distillery
at
five
thousand
dollars
an
old
negro
who
attended
the
still
and
cooked
the
meals
was
his
only
companion
we
had
finished
our
frugal
repast
when
a
man
shouting
in
the
darkness
approached
the
house
on
horseback
this
individual
though
very
tipsy
represented
law
and
order
in
that
district
as
i
was
informed
when
jim
gore
a
justice
of
the
peace
saluted
me
in
a
boisterous
manner
seating
himself
by
the
fire
he
earnestly
inquired
for
the
bottle
his
stomach
he
said
was
as
dry
as
a
and
though
water
answers
to
slake
lime
he
demanded
something
stronger
to
slake
the
fire
that
burned
within
him
he
was
very
suspicious
of
me
when
hall
told
him
of
my
canoe
journey
after
eying
me
from
head
to
toe
in
as
steady
a
manner
as
he
was
capable
of
he
broke
forth
with
now
stranger
this
wo
do
what
are
ye
in
this
sort
of
way
for
in
a
paper
i
pleaded
a
strong
desire
to
study
geography
but
the
wise
fellow
replied
geography
geography
why
the
fellers
who
rite
geography
never
travel
they
stay
at
home
and
spin
their
yarns
things
they
never
sees
then
glancing
at
his
poor
butternut
coat
and
pantaloons
he
felt
my
blue
woollen
suit
and
continued
in
a
slow
husky
voice
stranger
them
clothes
cost
something
they
be
that
paper
cost
money
i
tell
ye
and
it
costs
something
to
travel
the
hull
length
of
the
land
no
stranger
if
ye
be
not
on
a
bet
then
somebody
ye
well
for
it
for
an
hour
i
entertained
this
roughest
of
law
dignitaries
with
an
account
of
my
long
row
its
trials
and
its
pleasures
he
became
interested
in
the
story
and
finally
related
to
me
his
own
aspirations
and
the
difficulties
attending
his
efforts
to
make
the
people
respect
the
laws
and
good
government
he
then
described
the
river
route
through
the
swamps
to
the
sea
and
putting
his
arm
around
me
in
the
most
affectionate
manner
he
mournfully
said
o
stranger
my
heart
is
with
ye
but
o
how
ye
will
have
to
take
it
when
ye
go
past
those
awful
wretches
how
they
will
give
it
to
ye
they
most
knocked
me
off
my
raft
last
time
i
went
to
georgetown
beware
of
them
i
warn
ye
in
time
dern
the
hussies
squire
jim
so
emphasized
the
danger
that
i
became
somewhat
alarmed
for
more
than
anything
else
i
dreaded
an
outbreak
with
rough
women
and
then
too
my
new
acquaintance
informed
me
that
there
were
four
or
five
of
these
wretches
of
the
worst
kind
located
several
miles
down
the
stream
as
i
was
about
to
inquire
into
the
habits
of
these
ugly
old
crones
hall
wishing
to
give
squire
james
a
hint
remarked
that
might
at
any
time
retire
to
the
next
room
where
half
the
bed
was
at
his
disposal
half
the
bed
roared
the
squire
here
are
three
of
us
and
where
my
half
why
squire
hesitatingly
responded
my
host
is
my
guest
and
having
but
one
bed
he
must
have
half
of
it
no
less
then
what
to
become
of
me
thundered
his
majesty
of
the
law
having
been
informed
that
a
would
have
been
ready
had
he
given
notice
of
his
visit
and
that
at
some
future
time
when
not
so
crowded
he
could
be
entertained
like
a
gentleman
he
drew
himself
up
wrapped
in
the
mantle
of
dignity
and
replied
none
of
that
soft
talk
my
friend
this
man
is
a
traveller
let
him
take
luck
three
in
a
bed
i
bound
to
sleep
with
him
hall
where
the
bottle
i
now
retired
to
the
back
room
and
without
undressing
planted
myself
on
the
side
of
the
bed
next
the
wall
sleep
was
however
an
unattainable
luxury
with
the
squire
voice
in
the
next
room
as
he
told
how
the
country
was
going
to
the
dogs
because
niggers
and
white
folks
would
respect
the
laws
it
took
half
a
time
to
larn
it
to
and
much
thanks
he
ever
got
by
setting
everybody
to
rights
he
wound
up
by
lecturing
hall
for
being
so
temperate
his
diligent
search
in
all
directions
for
bottles
or
jugs
being
rewarded
by
finding
them
filled
with
unsatisfactory
emptiness
he
then
tumbled
into
the
centre
of
the
bed
crowding
me
close
against
the
wall
poor
hall
having
the
outside
left
to
him
spent
the
night
in
exercising
his
brain
and
muscles
in
vain
attempts
to
keep
in
his
bed
for
when
his
majesty
of
the
law
put
his
arms
akimbo
the
traveller
went
to
the
wall
and
the
host
to
the
floor
thus
passed
my
first
night
in
the
great
swamps
of
the
waccamaw
river
the
negro
cook
gave
us
an
early
breakfast
of
bacon
sweet
potatoes
and
corn
bread
the
squire
again
looked
round
for
the
bottle
and
again
found
nothing
but
emptiness
he
helped
me
to
carry
my
canoe
along
the
unsteady
footing
of
the
dark
swamp
to
the
lower
side
of
the
raft
of
logs
and
warmly
pressed
my
hand
as
he
whispered
my
dear
i
shall
think
of
you
until
you
get
past
those
dreadful
keep
an
eye
on
your
little
boat
or
they
devil
you
propelled
by
my
double
paddle
the
canoe
seemed
to
fly
through
the
great
forest
that
rose
with
its
tall
trunks
and
weird
arms
out
of
the
water
the
owls
were
still
hooting
indeed
the
dolorous
voice
of
this
bird
of
darkness
sounded
through
the
heavy
woods
at
intervals
throughout
the
day
i
seemed
to
have
left
the
real
world
behind
me
and
to
have
entered
upon
a
landless
region
of
sky
trees
and
water
beware
of
the
said
hall
before
i
left
only
the
crackers
and
know
them
if
followed
they
would
save
you
many
a
mile
but
every
opening
through
the
swamp
is
not
a
keep
to
the
main
stream
though
it
be
more
crooked
and
longer
if
you
take
to
the
you
may
get
into
passages
that
will
lead
you
off
into
the
swamps
and
into
interior
bayous
from
which
you
will
never
emerge
men
have
starved
to
death
in
such
places
so
i
followed
the
winding
stream
which
turned
back
upon
itself
running
north
and
south
and
east
and
west
as
if
trying
to
box
the
compass
by
following
the
sun
in
its
revolution
after
paddling
down
one
bend
i
could
toss
a
stick
through
the
trees
into
the
stream
where
the
canoe
had
cleaved
its
waters
a
quarter
of
a
mile
behind
me
the
thought
of
what
i
should
do
in
this
landless
region
if
my
frail
shell
in
its
rapid
flight
to
the
sea
happened
to
be
pierced
by
a
snag
was
to
say
the
least
not
a
comforting
one
on
what
could
i
stand
to
repair
it
to
climb
a
tree
seemed
in
such
a
case
the
only
resource
and
then
what
anxious
waiting
there
would
be
for
some
maker
in
his
canoe
to
come
to
the
rescue
and
take
the
traveller
from
his
dangerous
lodgings
between
heaven
and
earth
or
it
might
be
that
no
one
would
pass
that
way
and
the
weary
waiting
would
be
even
unto
death
but
sounds
now
reached
my
ears
that
made
me
feel
that
i
was
not
quite
alone
in
this
desolate
swamp
the
gray
squirrels
scolded
among
the
robins
the
brown
thrush
and
a
large
black
woodpecker
with
his
bright
red
head
each
reminded
me
of
him
without
whose
notice
not
a
sparrow
falleth
to
the
ground
ten
miles
of
this
black
current
were
passed
over
when
the
first
signs
of
civilization
appeared
in
the
shape
of
a
house
located
upon
a
point
of
the
mainland
which
entered
the
swamp
on
the
left
shore
of
the
river
at
this
point
the
river
widened
to
five
or
six
rods
and
at
intervals
land
appeared
a
few
inches
above
the
water
wherever
the
pine
land
touched
the
river
a
of
rails
offered
shelter
and
a
for
the
hogs
which
are
turned
loose
by
the
white
cracker
to
feed
upon
the
roots
and
mast
of
the
wilderness
reeve
ferry
on
the
right
bank
with
a
little
store
and
twenty
miles
from
old
dock
was
the
next
sign
of
the
presence
of
man
in
this
swamp
the
river
now
became
broad
as
i
approached
piraway
ferry
which
is
two
miles
below
piraway
farm
remembering
the
warnings
of
the
squire
as
to
the
awful
wretches
in
the
big
pine
woods
i
kept
a
sharp
lookout
for
the
old
women
who
were
to
give
me
so
much
trouble
but
the
raftsmen
on
the
river
explained
that
though
jim
gore
had
told
me
the
truth
i
had
misunderstood
his
pronunciation
of
the
word
reaches
or
river
bends
which
are
called
in
this
vicinity
wretches
the
reaches
referred
to
by
gore
were
so
long
and
straight
as
to
afford
open
passages
for
wind
to
blow
up
them
and
these
fierce
gusts
of
head
winds
give
the
raftsmen
much
trouble
while
poling
their
rafts
against
them
my
fears
of
ill
treatment
were
now
at
rest
for
my
tiny
craft
with
her
bow
was
well
adapted
for
such
work
landing
at
the
ferry
where
a
small
scow
or
was
resting
upon
the
firm
land
the
ferryman
daniel
dunkin
would
not
permit
me
to
camp
out
of
doors
while
his
was
only
one
mile
away
on
the
uplands
he
told
me
that
the
between
north
and
south
carolina
crossed
this
swamp
three
and
a
half
miles
below
piraway
ferry
and
that
the
first
town
on
the
river
waccamaw
in
south
carolina
conwayborough
was
a
distance
of
ninety
miles
by
river
and
only
thirty
miles
by
land
there
was
but
one
bridge
over
the
river
from
its
head
to
conwayborough
and
it
was
built
by
james
wortham
twenty
years
before
for
his
plantation
this
bridge
was
twenty
miles
below
piraway
and
from
it
by
land
to
a
settlement
on
little
river
which
empties
into
the
atlantic
was
a
distance
of
only
five
miles
a
short
canal
would
connect
this
river
and
its
lumber
regions
with
little
river
and
the
sea
for
the
first
time
in
my
experience
as
a
traveller
i
had
entered
a
country
where
the
miles
were
short
when
fifteen
years
old
i
made
my
first
journey
alone
and
on
foot
from
the
vicinity
of
boston
to
the
white
mountains
of
new
hampshire
this
boyish
pedestrian
trip
occupied
about
days
and
covered
some
three
hundred
miles
of
hard
tramping
new
england
gives
honest
measure
on
the
along
her
highways
the
traveller
learns
by
experience
the
length
of
her
miles
but
in
the
wilderness
of
the
south
there
is
no
standard
of
five
thousand
two
hundred
and
eighty
feet
to
a
statute
mile
and
the
watermen
along
the
are
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
of
a
degree
of
latitude
about
six
thousand
and
eighty
feet
is
the
geographical
and
nautical
mile
of
the
cartographer
as
well
as
the
knot
of
the
sailor
at
piraway
ferry
no
two
of
the
raftsmen
and
lumbermen
ignorant
or
educated
would
give
the
same
distance
either
upon
the
lengths
of
surveyed
roads
or
unmeasured
rivers
it
is
one
hundred
and
miles
by
river
from
piraway
ferry
to
conwayborough
said
one
who
had
travelled
the
route
for
years
the
most
moderate
estimate
made
was
that
of
ninety
miles
by
river
the
reader
therefore
must
not
accuse
me
of
overstating
distances
while
absent
from
the
seaboard
as
my
friends
of
the
coast
survey
bureau
have
not
yet
penetrated
into
these
interior
regions
with
their
theodolites
and
telametrerods
to
the
canoeist
who
is
ambitious
to
score
up
miles
instead
of
collecting
geographical
notes
these
wild
rivers
afford
an
excellent
opportunity
to
satisfy
his
aims
from
sixty
to
eighty
miles
can
be
rowed
in
ten
hours
as
easily
as
forty
miles
can
be
gone
over
upon
a
river
of
slow
current
in
the
northern
states
there
is
i
am
sorry
to
say
a
class
of
american
travellers
who
do
all
the
capitals
of
europe
in
the
same
way
and
if
they
have
anything
to
say
in
regard
to
life
in
the
countries
through
which
they
pass
they
forget
to
thank
the
compiler
of
the
for
the
information
they
possess
there
was
but
one
room
in
the
cabin
of
my
new
acquaintance
who
represented
that
class
of
people
called
in
the
south
because
they
subsist
largely
upon
corn
corn
crackers
or
crackers
these
crackers
are
the
poor
white
folks
of
the
planter
and
de
white
trash
of
the
old
slave
who
now
as
a
freedman
is
beginning
to
feel
the
responsibility
of
his
position
these
crackers
are
a
very
people
but
few
of
them
can
read
or
write
the
children
of
the
negro
filled
with
curiosity
and
a
newborn
pride
whenever
opportunity
permits
attend
the
schools
in
large
numbers
but
the
very
indolent
white
man
seems
to
be
destitute
of
all
ambition
and
his
children
in
many
places
in
the
south
following
close
in
the
father
footsteps
grow
up
in
an
almost
unimaginable
ignorance
the
news
of
the
arrival
of
the
little
maria
theresa
at
piraway
ferry
spread
with
astonishing
rapidity
through
the
woods
and
on
sunday
after
de
shoutings
as
the
negroes
call
their
meetings
were
over
the
blacks
came
in
numbers
to
see
dat
paper
canno
these
simple
people
eyed
me
from
head
to
foot
with
a
grave
sort
of
curiosity
their
great
mouths
open
displaying
pearly
teeth
of
which
a
white
man
might
well
be
proud
you
is
a
good
man
we
knows
dat
they
said
and
when
i
asked
why
the
answer
showed
their
childlike
faith
you
could
hab
come
all
dis
way
in
a
paper
boat
if
de
lord
had
helped
you
he
dono
help
only
good
folks
the
cracker
also
came
with
his
children
to
view
the
wonder
while
the
raftsmen
were
so
struck
with
the
advantages
of
my
double
paddle
which
originated
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
arctic
regions
that
they
laid
it
upon
a
board
and
drew
its
outlines
with
chalk
they
vowed
they
would
introduce
it
upon
the
river
these
crackers
declared
it
would
take
more
than
de
shoutings
or
any
other
religious
service
to
improve
the
moral
condition
of
the
blacks
they
openly
accused
the
colored
preachers
of
disturbing
the
nocturnal
rest
of
their
hens
and
turkeys
and
as
to
and
why
we
wo
have
any
critters
left
ef
this
government
lasts
much
longer
they
feelingly
exclaimed
we
does
nothing
to
nobody
we
lets
the
niggers
alone
but
niggers
will
steal
they
help
it
the
poor
devils
it
in
now
ef
they
eats
us
out
of
house
and
home
what
can
a
poor
man
do
they
puts
up
for
justices
of
peace
and
sends
to
the
legislature
when
they
read
more
us
and
they
do
say
it
we
fit
in
the
confederate
sarvice
that
they
razes
the
nigger
over
our
heads
now
does
the
folkes
up
north
like
to
see
white
people
tyrannized
over
by
niggers
jes
tell
when
you
go
back
stranger
that
we
got
soulds
like
yours
up
north
and
we
got
feelings
too
by
thunder
jes
like
other
white
men
this
was
a
white
country
once
now
it
all
niggers
and
dogs
why
them
niggers
in
the
legislature
has
spitboxes
lined
with
gold
to
spit
in
what
this
country
to
we
wish
the
niggers
no
harm
if
they
lets
our
hogs
and
chickens
alone
after
this
tirade
it
was
amusing
to
see
how
friendly
the
whites
and
blacks
were
the
crackers
conversed
with
these
children
of
ham
who
had
been
stealing
their
hams
for
so
long
a
time
in
the
most
kindly
way
realizing
perhaps
that
they
had
various
peculiar
traits
of
their
own
and
must
after
all
endure
their
neighbors
a
traveller
should
place
facts
before
his
readers
and
leave
to
them
the
drawing
of
the
moral
northern
men
and
women
who
go
to
the
southern
states
and
reside
for
even
the
short
space
of
a
year
or
two
invariably
change
their
views
and
principles
regarding
the
negro
as
a
moral
and
social
creature
when
these
people
return
to
their
homes
in
maine
or
massachusetts
as
did
the
representatives
of
the
granges
of
the
northern
states
after
they
had
visited
south
carolina
in
a
new
light
derived
from
contact
with
facts
dawns
upon
them
while
their
surprised
and
untravelled
neighbors
say
so
you
have
become
southern
in
your
views
i
never
would
have
thought
that
of
you
the
railroad
has
become
one
of
the
great
mediums
of
enlightenment
to
mankind
and
joins
in
a
social
fraternity
the
disunited
elements
of
a
country
god
grant
that
the
resources
of
the
great
south
may
soon
be
developed
by
the
capital
and
free
labor
of
the
north
our
sister
states
of
the
south
exhausted
by
the
struggles
of
the
late
war
which
resulted
in
consolidating
more
firmly
than
ever
the
great
union
are
now
ready
to
receive
every
honest
effort
to
develop
their
wealth
or
cultivate
their
territory
let
every
national
patriot
give
up
narrowness
of
views
and
sectional
selfishness
and
become
acquainted
with
not
the
politicians
the
people
of
the
new
south
and
a
harmony
of
feeling
will
soon
possess
the
hearts
of
all
true
lovers
of
a
government
of
the
people
the
swamp
tributaries
were
swelling
the
river
into
a
very
rapid
torrent
as
i
paddled
away
from
the
ferry
on
monday
january
a
warmer
latitude
having
been
reached
i
could
dispense
with
one
blanket
and
this
i
had
presented
to
my
kind
host
who
had
refused
to
accept
payment
for
his
hospitality
he
was
very
proud
of
his
present
and
said
feelingly
no
one
shall
touch
this
but
me
his
good
wife
had
baked
some
of
a
rich
and
very
nice
variety
of
unlike
those
we
get
in
new
jersey
or
the
other
middle
potatoes
she
kindly
added
to
my
stores
they
are
not
dry
or
mealy
when
cooked
but
seem
saturated
with
honey
the
poor
woman
gift
now
occupied
the
space
formerly
taken
up
by
the
blanket
i
had
given
her
husband
from
this
day
as
latitude
after
latitude
was
crossed
on
my
way
southward
i
distributed
every
article
i
could
spare
among
these
poor
people
mcgreggor
went
in
his
rob
roy
canoe
over
the
rivers
of
europe
diffusing
cheerfulness
and
distributing
evangelical
tracts
i
had
no
room
for
tracts
and
if
i
had
followed
the
example
of
my
intentioned
predecessor
in
canoeing
it
would
have
served
the
cause
of
truth
or
creed
but
little
the
crackers
could
not
read
and
but
few
of
the
grown
negroes
had
been
taught
letters
they
did
not
want
books
but
tobacco
men
and
women
hailed
me
from
the
banks
as
i
glided
along
in
my
canoe
with
say
captain
hab
you
eny
or
snuff
for
dis
chile
poor
humanity
the
cracker
and
the
freedman
fill
alike
their
places
according
to
the
light
they
possess
do
we
who
have
been
taught
from
our
youth
sacred
things
do
more
than
this
do
we
love
our
neighbor
as
ourself
for
twenty
miles
local
authority
i
journeyed
down
the
stream
without
seeing
a
human
being
or
a
to
stanley
house
and
the
bridge
from
which
i
urged
the
canoe
miles
further
passing
an
old
field
on
a
bluff
when
darkness
settled
on
the
swamps
and
a
heavy
mist
rose
from
the
waters
and
enveloped
the
forests
in
its
folds
with
not
a
trace
of
land
above
water
i
groped
about
running
into
what
appeared
to
be
openings
in
the
submerged
land
only
to
find
my
canoe
tangled
in
thickets
it
was
useless
to
go
further
and
i
prepared
to
ascend
to
the
forks
of
a
giant
tree
with
a
light
rope
to
be
used
for
lashing
my
body
into
a
safe
position
when
a
long
low
cry
engaged
my
attention
waugh
ho
ho
ho
peig
peig
came
through
the
still
thick
air
it
was
not
an
owl
nor
a
catamount
that
cried
thus
nor
was
it
the
bark
of
a
fox
it
was
the
voice
of
a
cracker
calling
in
his
hogs
from
the
forest
this
sound
was
indeed
pleasant
to
my
ears
for
i
knew
the
upland
was
near
and
that
a
warm
fire
awaited
my
benumbed
limbs
in
the
cabin
of
this
unknown
man
pushing
the
canoe
towards
the
sound
and
feeling
the
submerged
border
of
the
swamp
with
my
paddle
i
struck
the
upland
where
it
touched
the
water
and
disembarking
felt
my
way
along
a
path
to
a
little
clearing
here
a
drove
of
hogs
were
crowding
around
their
owner
who
was
scattering
kernels
of
corn
about
him
as
he
vociferated
pig
pig
pig
we
stood
face
to
face
yet
neither
could
see
the
face
of
the
other
in
the
darkness
i
told
my
tale
and
asked
where
i
could
find
a
sheltered
spot
to
camp
stranger
slowly
replied
the
cracker
my
cabin
close
at
hand
come
home
with
me
it
a
bad
night
for
a
man
to
lay
out
in
and
the
niggers
would
steal
your
traps
if
they
knew
you
had
anything
worth
taking
come
with
me
in
the
tall
pines
near
at
hand
was
a
cabin
of
peeled
rails
the
chinks
between
them
being
stuffed
with
moss
a
roof
of
cypress
shingles
kept
the
rain
out
the
log
chimney
which
was
plastered
with
mud
was
built
outside
of
the
walls
and
against
an
end
of
the
structure
the
fireplace
sent
forth
a
blaze
of
light
as
we
entered
the
poor
man
home
i
saw
in
the
nicely
swept
floor
the
clean
and
the
general
neatness
of
the
place
the
character
of
wilson
wife
hog
and
hominy
our
food
here
in
the
piny
woods
said
mr
edge
as
his
wife
invited
us
to
the
little
table
and
we
a
few
eggs
now
and
then
to
eat
with
sweet
potatoes
but
it
work
to
keep
the
niggers
from
killing
every
fowl
and
animal
we
have
the
politicians
promised
them
every
one
for
his
vote
forty
acres
of
land
and
a
mule
they
sed
as
how
the
northern
government
was
to
give
it
to
um
but
the
poor
devils
never
got
any
thanks
even
for
their
votes
they
had
been
stuffed
with
all
sorts
of
notions
by
the
and
i
do
blame
um
for
putting
on
airs
and
trying
to
rule
us
it
human
natur
that
all
we
do
blame
the
niggers
half
so
much
as
those
who
puts
it
in
their
heads
to
do
so
but
hard
times
we
had
we
poor
woods
folks
they
took
our
children
for
the
cussed
war
to
fight
fur
niggers
and
rich
people
as
owned
um
we
never
could
find
out
what
all
the
fuss
was
about
but
when
jeff
davis
made
a
law
to
exempt
every
man
from
the
army
who
owned
fifteen
niggers
then
our
blood
riz
right
up
and
we
sez
to
our
neighbors
ere
to
be
a
rich
man
quarrel
and
a
poor
man
fight
after
all
they
dragged
off
my
boy
to
chambersburg
pennsylvania
and
killed
him
a
fighting
for
what
why
for
rich
nigger
owners
our
young
men
hid
in
the
swamps
but
they
were
hunted
up
and
forced
into
the
army
niggers
has
been
our
ruin
ef
a
white
man
takes
a
case
before
a
nigger
justice
he
gives
the
nigger
everything
and
the
white
man
has
to
stand
one
side
now
would
you
folks
up
north
like
to
have
a
nigger
justice
who
read
nor
count
ten
figgurs
i
tried
to
comfort
the
poor
man
by
assuring
him
that
outside
of
the
political
enemies
of
our
peace
the
masses
in
the
north
were
honestly
inclined
towards
the
south
now
that
slavery
was
at
an
end
and
that
wrong
could
not
long
prevail
with
the
cheerful
prospect
of
a
new
administration
and
the
removal
of
all
unconstitutional
forces
that
preyed
upon
the
south
the
two
beds
in
the
single
room
of
the
cabin
were
occupied
by
the
family
while
i
slept
upon
the
floor
by
the
fire
with
my
blankets
for
a
couch
and
a
roll
of
homespun
for
a
pillow
which
the
women
called
heading
they
often
said
let
me
give
you
some
heading
for
your
bed
we
waited
until
eight
the
next
day
for
the
mists
to
rise
from
the
swamps
my
daily
trouble
was
now
upon
me
how
could
i
remunerate
a
southerner
for
his
cost
of
keeping
me
when
not
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
an
invited
guest
to
his
hospitality
wilson
edge
sat
by
the
fire
while
his
wife
and
little
ones
were
preparing
to
accompany
me
to
see
the
paper
boat
mr
edge
i
stammered
you
have
treated
me
with
great
kindness
your
wife
has
been
put
to
some
inconvenience
as
i
came
in
so
unexpected
a
manner
and
you
will
really
oblige
me
if
you
will
accept
a
little
money
for
all
this
though
money
can
not
pay
for
your
hospitality
grant
my
wish
and
you
will
send
me
away
with
a
light
heart
the
poor
cracker
lowered
his
head
and
slowly
ran
his
fingers
through
his
coal
black
hair
for
a
moment
he
seemed
studying
a
reply
and
then
he
spoke
as
though
he
represented
the
whole
generous
heart
of
the
south
stranger
he
slowly
articulated
stranger
i
have
known
white
men
to
be
niggers
enough
to
take
a
stranger
money
for
lodgings
and
vittles
but
i
am
not
that
man
we
found
the
canoe
as
it
had
been
left
the
night
before
and
i
was
soon
pulling
down
the
river
the
great
wilderness
was
traversed
thirty
miles
to
the
county
town
of
conwayborough
where
the
negroes
roared
with
laughter
at
the
working
of
the
double
paddle
as
i
shot
past
the
where
cotton
and
naval
stores
were
piled
waiting
to
be
lightered
nine
miles
to
pot
bluff
so
called
from
the
fact
of
a
pot
being
lost
from
a
vessel
near
it
which
place
is
reached
by
vessels
from
new
york
drawing
twelve
feet
of
water
though
still
a
long
distance
from
the
ocean
i
was
beginning
to
feel
its
tidal
influences
at
pot
bluff
the
landing
and
comfortable
home
of
its
owner
dusenberry
presented
a
pleasant
relief
after
the
monotony
of
the
great
pine
forests
this
enterprising
business
man
made
my
short
stay
a
very
pleasant
one
wednesday
january
was
cold
for
this
latitude
and
ice
formed
in
thin
sheets
in
the
miles
below
pot
bluff
bull
creek
enters
the
waccamaw
from
the
peedee
river
at
the
mouth
of
this
connecting
watercourse
is
tip
top
the
first
rice
plantation
of
the
waccamaw
the
peedee
and
its
sister
stream
run
an
almost
parallel
course
from
bull
creek
to
winyah
bay
making
their
debouchure
close
to
the
city
of
georgetown
steam
sawmills
and
rice
plantations
take
the
place
of
the
forests
from
a
few
miles
below
tip
top
to
the
vicinity
of
georgetown
blakely
of
new
york
one
of
the
largest
shingle
manufacturers
of
the
south
occupied
as
his
headquarters
the
bates
hill
plantation
on
the
peedee
this
gentleman
had
invited
me
through
the
medium
of
the
to
visit
him
in
the
regions
of
south
carolina
to
reach
his
home
i
took
the
short
which
bull
creek
offered
and
entered
upon
the
strongest
of
the
thick
yellow
muddy
torrent
of
the
peedee
rushed
through
bull
creek
with
such
volume
that
i
wondered
if
it
left
much
water
on
the
other
side
to
give
character
to
the
river
as
it
followed
its
own
channel
to
winyah
bay
one
and
a
half
miles
of
vigorous
paddling
brought
me
to
a
branch
of
the
watercourse
which
is
much
narrower
than
the
main
one
and
is
consequently
called
little
bull
creek
this
also
comes
from
the
peedee
river
and
its
source
is
nearer
to
the
bates
hill
plantation
than
the
main
bull
creek
to
urge
the
canoe
up
this
narrow
stream
three
miles
and
a
half
to
the
parent
river
peedee
was
a
most
trying
ordeal
at
times
the
boat
would
not
move
a
hundred
feet
in
five
minutes
and
often
as
my
strength
seemed
failing
me
i
caught
the
friendly
branches
of
trees
and
held
on
to
keep
the
canoe
from
being
whirled
down
the
current
towards
the
waccamaw
after
long
and
persistent
efforts
had
exhausted
my
strength
i
was
about
to
seek
for
a
in
the
swamp
when
a
view
of
the
broad
peedee
opened
before
me
and
with
vigorous
strokes
of
the
paddle
the
canoe
slowly
approached
the
mighty
current
a
moment
more
and
it
was
within
its
grasp
and
went
flying
down
the
turbulent
stream
at
the
rate
of
ten
miles
an
hour
a
loud
halloo
greeted
me
from
the
swamp
where
a
party
of
negro
were
at
work
they
manned
their
boat
a
long
cypress
and
followed
me
their
employer
who
proved
to
be
the
gentleman
whose
i
was
now
rapidly
approaching
sat
in
the
stern
we
landed
together
before
the
old
plantation
house
which
had
been
occupied
a
few
years
before
by
members
of
the
wealthy
and
powerful
aristocracy
of
the
peedee
but
was
now
the
temporary
home
of
a
northern
man
who
was
busily
employed
in
guiding
the
labors
of
his
four
hundred
freedmen
in
the
swamps
of
north
and
south
carolina
the
paper
canoe
had
now
entered
the
regions
of
the
along
the
low
banks
of
the
peedee
were
diked
marshes
where
before
the
civil
war
each
estate
produced
from
five
thousand
to
forty
thousand
bushels
of
rice
annually
and
the
lords
of
rice
were
more
powerful
than
those
of
cotton
though
cotton
was
king
the
rich
lands
here
produced
as
high
as
bushels
of
rice
to
the
acre
under
forced
slave
labor
now
the
free
blacks
can
not
wrest
from
nature
more
than
or
thirty
bushels
fine
old
mansions
lined
the
river
banks
but
the
families
had
been
so
reduced
by
the
ravages
of
war
that
i
saw
refined
ladies
who
had
been
educated
in
the
schools
of
edinburgh
scotland
overseeing
the
negroes
as
they
worked
in
the
yards
of
the
the
undaunted
spirit
of
these
southern
ladies
as
they
worked
in
their
homes
now
so
desolate
roused
my
admiration
a
light
graceful
figure
enveloped
in
an
old
shawl
and
mounted
on
an
old
horse
flitted
about
one
plantation
like
a
restless
spirit
that
lady
father
said
a
gentleman
to
me
owned
three
plantations
worth
three
millions
of
dollars
before
the
war
there
is
a
on
one
of
the
plantations
which
cost
thirty
thousand
dollars
she
now
fights
against
misfortune
and
will
not
give
up
the
confederate
war
would
not
have
lasted
six
months
if
it
had
not
been
for
our
women
they
drove
thousands
of
us
young
men
into
the
fight
and
now
having
lost
all
they
go
bravely
to
work
even
taking
the
places
of
their
old
servants
in
their
grand
old
homes
it
hard
for
them
though
i
assure
you
on
tuesday
january
i
paddled
down
the
peedee
stopping
at
the
plantations
of
weston
and
colonel
benjamin
allston
the
latter
gentleman
was
a
son
of
one
of
the
governors
of
south
carolina
he
kindly
gave
me
a
letter
of
introduction
to
commodore
richard
lowndes
who
lived
near
the
coast
from
the
peedee
i
passed
through
a
cut
in
the
marshes
into
the
broad
waccamaw
and
descended
it
to
winyah
bay
georgetown
is
located
between
the
mouths
of
the
peedee
and
sampit
rivers
cautiously
approaching
the
city
i
landed
at
david
risley
steam
and
that
gentleman
kindly
secreted
my
boat
in
a
back
while
i
went
up
town
to
visit
the
by
some
to
me
unaccountable
means
the
people
had
heard
of
the
arrival
of
the
paper
boat
and
three
elaborately
dressed
negro
women
accosted
me
with
please
show
wees
tree
ladies
de
little
paper
boat
before
i
had
reached
my
destination
the
a
body
of
men
met
me
on
their
way
to
the
the
crowd
forced
me
back
to
the
canoe
and
asked
so
many
questions
that
i
was
sorely
taxed
to
find
answers
for
these
gentlemen
there
were
three
editors
in
the
crowd
two
were
white
men
one
a
negro
the
young
men
who
claimed
the
position
of
representatives
of
the
spirit
of
the
place
and
of
the
times
published
the
comet
while
the
negro
as
though
influenced
by
a
spirit
of
sarcasm
conducted
the
planet
the
third
newspaper
represented
at
the
canoe
reception
was
the
georgetown
times
which
courteously
noticed
the
little
boat
that
had
come
so
far
the
planet
prudently
kept
in
the
dark
and
said
nothing
but
the
comet
representing
the
culture
of
the
young
men
of
the
city
published
the
following
notice
of
my
arrival
tom
collins
has
at
last
arrived
in
his
wonderful
paper
boat
he
has
it
hitched
to
risley
new
where
every
one
can
have
a
view
he
intends
shooting
off
his
before
weighing
anchor
in
the
morning
hurrah
for
collins
i
left
risley
comfortable
home
before
noon
the
next
day
and
followed
the
shores
of
winyah
bay
towards
the
sea
near
battery
white
on
the
right
shore
in
the
pine
forests
was
the
of
marion
the
brave
patriot
of
the
american
revolution
whose
bugle
call
summoned
the
youth
of
those
days
to
arms
when
near
the
inlet
the
marshes
skirted
the
shore
for
some
distance
out
of
these
wet
lands
flowed
a
little
stream
called
mosquito
creek
which
once
connected
the
north
santee
river
with
winyah
bay
and
served
as
a
boundary
to
south
island
the
creek
was
very
crooked
and
the
strong
when
more
than
halfway
to
santee
river
i
was
forced
to
leave
the
stream
as
it
had
become
closed
by
tidal
deposits
and
rank
vegetation
the
ditches
of
rice
plantations
emptied
their
drainage
of
the
lowlands
into
mosquito
creek
following
a
wide
ditch
to
the
right
through
fields
of
rich
alluvial
soil
which
had
been
wrested
by
severe
toil
from
nature
the
boat
soon
reached
the
of
commodore
richard
lowndes
a
little
further
on
and
situated
in
a
noble
grove
of
which
were
draped
in
the
weird
festoons
of
spanish
moss
on
the
upland
arose
the
stately
home
of
the
planter
who
still
kept
his
plantation
in
cultivation
though
on
a
scale
of
less
magnitude
than
formerly
it
was
indeed
a
pleasant
evening
that
i
passed
in
the
company
of
the
refined
members
of
the
old
household
and
with
a
pang
of
regret
the
next
day
i
paddled
along
the
main
canal
of
the
lowlands
casting
backward
glances
at
the
old
house
with
its
grand
old
trees
the
canal
ended
at
north
santee
bay
while
i
was
preparing
to
ascend
the
river
a
tempest
arose
which
kept
me
a
weary
prisoner
among
the
reeds
of
the
rice
marsh
the
hollow
reeds
made
poor
fuel
for
cooking
and
when
the
dark
stormy
night
shut
down
upon
me
the
damp
soil
grew
damper
as
the
tide
arose
until
it
threatened
to
overflow
the
land
for
hours
i
lay
in
my
narrow
canoe
waiting
for
the
tidal
flood
to
do
its
worst
but
it
receded
and
left
me
without
any
means
of
building
a
fire
as
the
reeds
were
wet
by
the
storm
the
next
afternoon
being
tired
of
this
sort
of
and
cramped
for
lack
of
exercise
i
launched
the
canoe
into
the
rough
water
and
crossing
to
crow
island
found
a
lee
under
its
shores
which
permitted
me
to
ascend
the
river
to
the
mouth
of
atchison
creek
through
which
i
passed
two
miles
to
the
south
santee
river
all
these
rivers
are
bordered
by
rice
plantations
many
of
them
having
been
abandoned
to
the
care
of
the
freedmen
i
saw
no
white
men
upon
them
buildings
and
dikes
are
falling
into
ruins
and
the
river
freshets
frequently
inundate
the
land
many
of
the
owners
of
these
once
valuable
estates
are
too
much
reduced
in
wealth
to
attempt
their
proper
cultivation
it
is
in
any
case
difficult
to
get
the
freedmen
to
work
through
an
entire
season
even
when
well
paid
for
their
services
and
they
flock
to
the
towns
whenever
opportunity
permits
the
north
and
south
santee
rivers
empty
into
the
atlantic
but
their
entrances
are
so
shallow
that
georgetown
entrance
is
the
inlet
through
which
most
of
the
produce
of
the
country
pitch
tar
turpentine
rice
and
lumber
finds
exit
to
the
sea
as
i
left
the
canal
which
with
the
creek
makes
a
complete
thoroughfare
for
lighters
and
small
coasters
from
one
santee
river
to
the
other
a
renewal
of
the
tempest
made
me
seek
shelter
in
an
old
cabin
in
a
negro
settlement
each
house
of
which
was
built
upon
piles
driven
into
the
marshes
the
old
negro
overseer
of
the
plantation
hinted
to
me
that
his
hands
were
berry
spicious
of
ebbry
stranger
and
advised
me
to
row
to
some
other
locality
i
told
him
i
was
from
the
north
and
would
not
hurt
even
one
of
the
fleas
which
in
multitudes
infested
his
quarters
but
the
old
fellow
shook
his
head
and
would
not
be
responsible
for
me
if
i
staid
there
all
night
a
tall
darkey
who
had
listened
to
the
conversation
broke
in
with
now
uncle
ye
knows
dat

dis
gemmum

kept
repeating
some
niggers

well
uncle
replied
the
tall
black
ef
dis
man

a
yankeemans
ise
will
see
him
froo
then
he
questioned
me
while
the
fleas
having
telegraphed
to
each
other
that
a
stranger
had
arrived
made
sad
havoc
of
me
and
my
patience
my
name
jacob

jacob
helped
me
launch
my
boat
through
the
soft
mud
which
nearly
stalled
us
and
following
his
directions
i
paddled
across
the
south
santee
and
coasted
down
to
alligator
creek
where
extensive
marshes
covered
by
tall
reeds
hid
the
landscape
from
my
view
about
half
a
mile
from
the
mouth
of
the
creek
which
watercourse
was
on
my
direct
route
to
bull
bay
a
large
was
found
at
the
mouth
of
a
canal
this
being
wide
open
i
pushed
up
the
canal
to
a
low
point
of
land
which
rose
like
an
island
out
of
the
rushes
here
was
a
negro
hamlet
of
a
dozen
houses
or
shanties
and
the
ruins
of
a
the
majority
of
the
negroes
were
absent
working
within
the
diked
enclosures
of
this
large
estate
which
before
the
war
had
produced
forty
thousand
bushels
of
rice
annually
now
the
place
was
leased
by
a
former
slave
and
but
little
work
was
accomplished
under
the
present
management
seba
gillings
a
powerfully
built
negro
came
to
the
dike
upon
which
i
had
landed
the
canoe
i
quickly
told
him
my
story
and
how
i
had
been
forced
to
leave
the
last
negro
quarters
i
used
jacob
gilleu
name
as
authority
for
seeking
shelter
with
him
from
the
damps
of
the
lands
the
dignified
black
man
bade
me
fear
nuffing
stay
here
all
de
night
you
please
treat
you
like
white
man
mity
poor
but
gib
you
de
berry
best
i
hab
he
locked
my
boat
in
a
rickety
old
storehouse
and
gave
me
to
understand
dat
niggers
will
steal
de
berry
breff
from
a
man
mouff
he
took
me
to
his
home
and
soon
showed
me
how
he
managed
de
niggers
his
wife
sat
silently
by
the
fire
he
ordered
her
to
pound
de
rice
and
she
threw
a
quantity
of
unhulled
rice
into
a
wooden
mortar
three
feet
high
planted
in
the
ground
in
front
of
the
shanty
then
with
an
enormous
pestle
the
black
woman
pounded
the
grains
until
the
hulls
were
removed
when
seating
herself
upon
the
floor
of
the
dark
smoky
cabin
she
winnowed
the
rice
with
her
breath
while
her
long
slim
fingers
caught
and
removed
all
the
specks
of
dirt
from
the
mass
it
was
cooked
as
the
chinese
cook
it
not
to
a
glutinous
mass
as
we
of
the
north
prepare
but
each
grain
was
dry
and
entire
then
eggs
and
bacon
were
prepared
not
by
the
woman
but
by
the
son
a
lad
of
fourteen
years
all
these
movements
were
superintended
by
old
seba
who
sat
looking
as
dark
and
as
solemn
and
as
learned
as
an
associate
judge
on
the
bench
of
a
new
jersey
county
court
on
the
blackest
of
tables
minus
a
cloth
the
food
was
placed
for
the
stranger
as
soon
as
my
meal
was
finished
every
member
of
the
family
made
a
dash
for
the
fragments
and
the
board
was
cleared
in
a
wonderfully
short
space
of
time
then
we
gathered
round
the
great
fireplace
and
while
the
bright
coals
of
spread
a
streak
of
light
through
the
darkness
black
men
and
black
women
stole
into
the
room
until
everything
from
floor
to
ceiling
from
door
to
seemed
to
be
growing
blacker
and
blacker
and
i
felt
as
black
as
my
surroundings
the
scant
clothing
of
the
men
only
half
covered
their
shiny
ebony
skins
the
whole
company
preserved
a
dignified
silence
which
was
occasionally
broken
by
deep
sighs
coming
from
the
women
in
reply
to
a
all
de
way
from
de
norf
in
a
paper
canno
bless
de
lord
bless
de
lord
this
dull
monotony
was
broken
by
the
entrance
of
a
young
negro
who
having
made
a
passage
in
a
sloop
to
charleston
through
bay
was
looked
upon
as
a
great
traveller
and
to
him
were
referred
disputes
upon
nautical
matters
he
had
not
yet
seen
the
boat
but
he
proceeded
to
tell
the
negroes
present
all
about
it
he
first
bowed
to
me
with
a
and
then
struck
an
attitude
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
upon
this
natural
orator

gillings

and
clapped
their
shrivelled
hands
in
ecstasy
the
little
black
tried
to
run
his
fingers
through
his
short
woolly
hair
as
he
continued
what

as
the
women
had
become
very
piously
inclined
and
were
in
just
the
state
of
nervous
excitement
to
commence
de
shoutings
old
uncle
seba
rudely
informed
them
that
de
wants
sleep
and
cleared
the
room
of
the
crowd
to
my
great
relief
for
the
state
of
the
atmosphere
was
beyond
description
seba
had
a
closet
where
he
kept
onions
muskrat
skins
and
other
pieces
of
personal
property
he
now
set
his
wife
to
sweeping
it
out
and
i
spread
my
clean
blankets
with
a
sigh
upon
the
black
floor
knowing
i
should
carry
away
in
the
morning
more
than
i
had
brought
into
seba
dwelling
i
will
not
now
expatiate
upon
the
small
annoyances
of
travel
but
to
the
canoeist
who
may
follow
the
southern
watercourses
traversed
by
the
paper
canoe
i
would
quietly
say
keep
away
from
cabins
of
all
kinds
and
you
will
by
so
doing
travel
with
a
light
heart
and
even
temper
when
i
cast
up
my
account
with
old
seba
the
next
morning
he
said
that
by
trading
the
rice
he
raised
he
could
obtain
bout
ebbry
ting
he
wanted
rum
rum
was
his
medicine
so
long
as
he
kept
a
little
stowed
away
he
admitted
he
was
often
sick
having
been
destitute
of
cash
and
consequently
of
rum
for
some
time
he
acknowledged
his
state
of
health
remarkable
and
he
was
a
model
of
strength
and
manly
development
all
the
other
negroes
were
specimens
while
their
hair
was
so
very
short
that
it
gave
them
the
appearance
of
being
bald
when
the
canoe
was
taken
out
of
the
storehouse
to
be
put
into
the
canal
these
creatures
swarmed
about
it
like
bees
not
a
trace
of
white
blood
could
be
detected
in
them
each
tried
to
put
a
finger
upon
the
boat
they
seemed
to
regard
it
as
a
fetich
and
i
believe
had
it
been
placed
upon
an
end
they
would
have
bowed
down
and
paid
their
african
devotions
to
it
only
the
oldest
ones
could
speak
english
well
enough
to
be
understood
the
youths
chattered
in
african
tongue
and
wore
talismans
about
their
necks
they
were
to
say
the
least
verging
on
barbarism
the
experience
gathered
among
the
blacks
of
other
lands
impressed
me
with
the
belief
that
in
more
than
one
place
in
the
south
would
the
african
fetich
be
set
up
and
worshipped
before
long
unless
the
church
bestirs
herself
to
look
well
to
her
home
missions
in
all
my
travels
outside
of
the
cities
in
the
south
it
has
not
been
my
good
fortune
to
find
an
educated
white
man
preaching
to
negroes
yet
everywhere
the
poor
blacks
gather
in
the
or
rudely
constructed
church
to
listen
to
ignorant
preachers
of
their
own
color
the
blind
leading
the
blind
a
few
men
of
negro
extraction
with
white
blood
in
their
veins
not
any
more
negro
than
white
man
consequently
not
negroes
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
are
sent
from
the
negro
colleges
of
the
south
to
lecture
northern
congregations
upon
the
needs
of
their
race
and
these
or
perhaps
white
men
are
with
their
intelligence
and
sometimes
brilliant
oratory
held
up
as
true
types
of
the
negro
race
by
northerners
while
there
is
in
fact
as
much
difference
between
the
pureblooded
negro
of
the
and
this
false
representative
of
his
needs
as
can
well
be
imagined
an
irishman
just
from
the
old
country
listened
one
evening
to
the
fascinating
eloquence
of
a
mulatto
freedman
the
good
irishman
had
never
seen
a
black
man
the
orator
said
i
am
only
half
a
black
man
my
mother
was
a
slave
my
father
a
white
planter
be
jabbers
shouted
the
excited
irishman
who
was
charmed
with
the
lecturer
if
you
are
only
half
a
nigger
what
must
a
whole
one
be
like
the
blacks
were
kind
and
civil
as
they
usually
are
when
fairly
treated
they
stood
upon
the
dike
and
shouted
unintelligible
farewells
as
i
descended
the
canal
to
alligator
creek
this
thoroughfare
soon
carried
me
on
its
current
to
the
sea
for
i
missed
a
narrow
entrance
to
the
marshes
called
the
eye
of
the
needle
a
steamboat
thoroughfare
and
found
myself
upon
the
calm
sea
which
pulsated
in
long
swells
to
the
south
was
the
low
island
of
cape
roman
which
like
a
protecting
arm
guarded
the
quiet
bay
behind
it
the
marshes
extended
from
the
main
almost
to
the
cape
while
upon
the
edge
of
the
rushy
meadows
upon
an
island
just
inside
of
the
cape
rose
the
tower
of
roman
light
this
was
the
first
time
my
tiny
shell
had
floated
upon
the
ocean
i
coasted
the
sandy
beach
of
the
muddy
lowlands
towards
the
lighthouse
until
i
found
a
creek
debouching
from
the
marsh
which
i
entered
and
from
one
watercourse
to
another
without
a
chart
found
my
way
at
dusk
into
bull
bay
the
see
was
rolling
in
and
breaking
upon
the
ashore
which
i
was
forced
to
hug
closely
as
the
old
disturbers
of
my
peace
the
porpoises
were
visible
fishing
in
numbers
to
escape
the
dangerous
raccoon
oyster
reefs
of
the
shoal
water
the
canoe
was
forced
into
a
deeper
channel
when
the
lively
porpoises
chased
the
boat
and
drove
me
back
again
on
to
the
shells
it
was
fast
growing
dark
and
no
place
of
refuge
nearer
than
the
upland
a
long
distance
across
the
soft
marsh
which
was
even
now
wet
with
them
the
rough
water
of
the
sound
the
oyster
reefs
which
threatened
to
pierce
my
boat
and
a
coast
which
would
be
submerged
by
the
next
floodtide
all
seemed
to
conspire
against
me
suddenly
my
anxiety
was
relieved
and
gratitude
filled
my
heart
as
the
tall
masts
of
a
schooner
rose
out
of
the
marshes
not
far
from
the
upland
telling
me
that
a
friendly
creek
was
near
at
hand
its
wide
mouth
soon
opened
invitingly
before
me
and
i
rowed
towards
the
beautiful
craft
anchored
in
its
current
the
trim
rig
of
which
plainly
said
the
property
of
the
united
states
an
officer
stood
on
the
quarterdeck
watching
my
approach
through
his
glass
and
as
i
was
passing
the
vessel
a
sailor
remarked
to
his
mates
that
is
the
paper
canoe
i
was
in
norfolk
last
december
when
it
reached
the
elizabeth
river
the
officer
kindly
hailed
me
and
offered
me
the
hospitality
of
the
schooner
caswell
in
the
cosiest
of
cabins
dennis
with
his
ogden
and
bond
with
their
interesting
conversation
soon
made
me
forget
the
discomforts
of
the
last
three
days
spent
in
the
muddy
flats
among
the
lowland
negroes
from
poor
kind
seba
gillings
black
to
the
neat
with
its
snowy
sheets
and
clean
towels
where
fresh
pure
water
could
be
used
without
stint
was
indeed
a
transition
the
party
expected
to
complete
their
work
as
far
as
charleston
harbor
before
the
season
closed
the
sunday
spent
on
the
caswell
greatly
refreshed
me
on
saturday
evening
dennis
traced
upon
a
sheet
of
paper
my
route
through
the
interior
coast
watercourses
to
charleston
harbor
and
i
left
the
pretty
schooner
on
monday
fully
posted
for
my
voyage
the
tide
commenced
flooding
at
eleven
and
the
flats
soon
afforded
me
water
for
their
passage
in
the
vicinity
of
the
shore
heavy
forests
covered
the
uplands
where
a
few
houses
were
visible
bull
island
with
pines
and
a
few
cabbage
palms
was
on
my
left
as
i
reached
the
entrance
of
the
southern
thoroughfare
at
the
end
of
the
bay
here
in
the
intricacies
of
creeks
and
passages
through
the
islands
and
made
careless
by
the
possession
of
dennis
chart
i
several
times
blundered
into
the
wrong
course
and
got
no
further
that
afternoon
than
price
inlet
though
i
rowed
more
than
twenty
miles
some
eight
miles
of
the
distance
rowed
was
lost
by
ascending
and
descending
creeks
by
mistake
after
a
weary
day
work
shelter
was
found
in
a
house
close
by
the
sea
on
the
shores
of
price
inlet
where
in
company
with
a
young
fisherman
who
was
in
the
employ
of
magwood
of
charleston
i
slept
upon
the
floor
in
my
blankets
charles
hucks
the
fisherman
asserted
that
three
albino
deer
were
killed
on
island
the
previous
winter
two
were
shot
by
a
negro
while
he
killed
the
third
magwood
terry
and
noland
of
charleston
one
summer
penned
beside
the
water
one
thousand
old
terrapin
to
hold
them
over
for
the
winter
season
these
would
consume
five
bushels
of
shrimps
in
one
hour
when
fed
a
tide
of
unusual
height
washed
out
the
terrapins
from
their
crawl
and
with
them
disappeared
all
anticipated
results
of
the
experiment
the
next
day
caper

dewees

from

while
following
the
creeks
in
the

back
of
sullivan
island
the
compact
mass
of
buildings
of
moultrieville
at
its
western
end
at
the
entrance
of
charleston
harbor
rose
imposingly
to
view
the
gloomy
mantle
of
darkness
was
settling
over
the
harbor
as
the
paper
canoe
stole
quietly
into
its
historic
waters
before
me
lay
the
quiet
bay
with
old
fort
sumter
rising
from
the
watery
plain
like
a
spectral
giant
as
though
to
remind
one
that
this
had
been
the
scene
of
mighty
struggles
the
tranquil
waters
softly
rippled
a
response
to
the
touch
of
my
oars
all
was
peace
and
quiet
here
where
only
a
few
short
years
before
the
thunder
of
cannon
woke
a
thousand
echoes
and
the
waves
were
stained
with
the
lifeblood
of
america
where
war
with
her
iron
throat
poured
out
destruction
and
creatures
men
made
after
his
own
image
destroyed
each
other
ruthlessly
having
never
in
all
that
civilization
had
done
for
them
discovered
any
other
way
of
settling
their
difficulties
than
by
this
wholesale
murder
the
actors
in
this
scene
were
scattered
now
they
had
returned
to
the
farm
the
workshop
the
desk
and
the
pulpit
the
old
flag
again
floated
upon
the
ramparts
of
sumter
and
a
government
was
trying
to
reconstruct
itself
so
that
the
great
republic
should
become
more
thoroughly
a
government
of
the
people
founded
upon
equal
rights
to
all
men
a
sharp
scraping
sound
under
my
boat
roused
me
from
my
revery
for
i
had
leaned
upon
my
oars
while
the
tide
had
carried
me
slowly
but
surely
upon
the
from
which
i
escaped
with
some
slight
damage
to
my
paper
shell
newspaper
reading
had
impressed
upon
me
a
belief
that
the
citizens
of
the
city
which
played
so
important
a
part
in
the
late
civil
war
might
not
treat
kindly
a
massachusetts
man
i
therefore
decided
to
go
up
to
the
city
upon
the
for
the
large
mail
which
awaited
my
arrival
at
the
charleston
after
receiving
which
i
intended
to
return
to
mount
pleasant
and
cross
the
bay
to
the
entrance
of
the
southern
watercourses
leaving
the
city
as
quietly
as
i
entered
it
my
curiosity
was
however
aroused
to
see
how
under
the
new
reconstruction
rule
things
were
conducted
in
the
once
proud
city
of
charleston
as
i
stood
at
the
window
of
the
delivery
and
inquired
through
the
narrow
window
for
my
letters
a
heavy
shadow
seemed
to
fall
upon
me
as
the
head
of
a
negro
appeared
the
black
features
underwent
a
sudden
change
as
i
pronounced
my
name
and
while
a
warm
glow
of
affection
lighted
up
his
dark
face
he
thrust
his
whole
arm
through
the
window
and
grasped
my
hand
with
a
vigorous
shake
in
the
most
friendly
manner
as
though
upon
his
shoulders
rested
the
good
name
of
the
people
welcome
to
charleston
welcome
to
our
beautiful
city
he
exclaimed
so
this
was
charleston
under
reconstruction
after
handing
me
my
mail
the
postmaster
graciously
remarked
our
rule
is
to
close
the
office
at
five
but
if
you
are
belated
any
day
tap
at
the
door
and
i
will
attend
you
this
was
my
first
welcome
to
charleston
but
before
i
could
return
to
my
quarters
at
mount
pleasant
members
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
the
carolina
club
and
others
pressed
upon
me
kind
attentions
and
hospitalities
while
james
frazer
of
the
south
carolina
regatta
association
sent
for
the
maria
theresa
and
placed
it
in
charge
of
the
wharfinger
of
the
southern
wharf
where
many
ladies
and
gentlemen
visited
it
when
i
left
the
old
city
a
few
days
later
i
blushed
to
think
how
i
had
doubted
these
people
whose
reputation
for
hospitality
to
strangers
had
been
for
more
than
half
a
century
while
here
i
was
the
guest
of
rev
brackett
the
pastor
of
one
of
charleston
churches
it
was
with
feelings
of
regret
i
turned
my
tiny
craft
towards
untried
waters
leaving
behind
me
the
beautiful
city
of
charleston
and
the
friends
who
had
so
kindly
cared

i
was
now
following

of
the

through

the

strong
proof
of

but
being
now
in

i

at

as
they
broke
from

around

at

the
extensive

of

reached
and
i
approached
the

rose
an

added
their

to
the

of

had
arrived
at

me
and

this
most
excellent
man
and
patriot
whose
soul
had
been
tried
as
by
fire
during
the
disturbances
caused
by
the
war
as
we
sat
together
in
that
room
where
in
years
gone
by
governor
aiken
had
entertained
his
northern
guests
with
englishmen
of
noble
blood
a
room
full
of
reminiscences
both
pleasant
and
painful
my
kind
host
freely
told
me
the
story
of
his
busy
life
which
sounded
like
a
tale
of
romance
he
had
tried
to
stay
the
wild
storm
of
secession
when
the
hung
gloomily
over
his
state
it
broke
and
his
unheeded
warnings
were
drowned
in
the
thunders
of
the
political
tempest
that
swept
over
the
fair
south
before
the
war
he
owned
one
thousand
slaves
he
organized
schools
to
teach
his
negroes
to
read
and
write
the
improvement
of
their
moral
condition
was
his
great
study
the
life
he
had
entered
upon
though
at
first
distasteful
had
been
forced
upon
him
and
he
met
his
peculiar
responsibilities
with
a
true
christian
desire
to
benefit
all
within
his
reach
when
a
young
man
having
returned
from
the
tour
of
europe
his
father
presented
him
with
jehossee
island
an
estate
of
five
thousand
acres
around
which
it
required
four
stout
negro
oarsmen
to
row
him
in
a
day
here
said
the
father
to
the
future
governor
of
south
carolina
as
he
presented
the
domain
to
his
son
here
are
the
means
now

to
work
and
develop
them
william
aiken
applied
himself
industriously
to
the
task
of
improving
the
talents
given
him
his
efforts
bore
good
fruit
as
year
after
year
jehossee
island
from
a
half
submerged
sedgy
boggy
waste
grew
into
one
of
the
finest
in
the
south
the
new
lord
of
the
manor
ditched
the
marshes
and
walled
in
his
new
with
dikes
to
keep
out
the
freshets
from
the
upland
and
the
tides
from
the
ocean
perfecting
a
complete
system
of
drainage
and
irrigation
he
built
comfortable
quarters
for
his
slaves
and
erected
a
church
and
schoolhouse
for
their
use
from
the
original
two
hundred
and
eighty
acres
of
cultivated
rice
land
the
new
proprietor
developed
the
wild
morass
into
sixteen
hundred
acres
of
and
six
hundred
acres
of
vegetable
corn
and
provender
producing
land
for
several
seasons
prior
to
the
war
jehossee
yielded
a
rice
crop
which
sold
for
seventy
thousand
dollars
and
netted
annually
fifty
thousand
dollars
income
to
the
owner
at
that
time
governor
aiken
had
eight
hundred
and
seventy
three
slaves
on
the
island
and
about
one
hundred
working
as
mechanics
in
charleston

not
tolerate
the
loose
matrimonial
ways
of
negro
life
but
compelled
his
slaves
to
accept
the
marriage
ceremony
and
herein
lay
one
of
his
chief
difficulties
for
to
whatever
cause
we
attribute
it
the
fact
remains
the
same
namely
that
the
ordinary
negro
has
no
sense
of
morality
after
all
the
attempts
made
on
this
plantation
to
improve
the
moral
nature
of
these
men
and
women
governor
aiken
during
a
season
in
savannah
after
the
war
while
visiting
the
poor
sufferers
intent
upon
charitable
works
found
in
the
lowest
quarter
of
the
city
sunk
in
the
most
abject
depths
of
vice
men
and
women
who
had
once
been
good
servants
on
his
plantations
in
old
times
jehossee
was
a
happy
place
for
master
and
for
slave
the
governor
rarely
locked
the
door
of
his
mansion
the
family
plate
valued
at
fifteen
thousand
dollars
was
stored
in
a
chest
in
a
room
on
the
of
the
house
which
had
for
its
occupants
during
four
months
of
the
year
two
or
three
negro
servants
though
all
the
negroes
at
the
quarters
which
were
only
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
mansion
knew
the
valuable
contents
of
the
chest
it
was
never
disturbed
they
stole
small
things
but
seemed
incapable
of
committing
a
burglary
when
the
union
army
marched
through
another
part
of
south
carolina
where
governor
aiken
had
buried
these
old
family
heirlooms
and
had
added
to
the
original
plate
thirty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
his
own
purchasing
the
soldiers
dug
up
this
and
thousand
dollars
worth
of
fine
silver
went
to
enrich
the
spoils
of
the
union
army
soon
after
three
thousand
eight
hundred
bottles
of
fine
old
wines
worth
from
eight
to
nine
dollars
a
bottle
were
dug
up
and
destroyed
by
a
confederate
order
to
prevent
the

from
capturing
them
thus
was
plundered
an
old
and
revered
governor
of
south
carolina
one
who
was
a
kind
neighbor
a
true
patriot
and
a
christian
gentleman
the
persecutions
of
the
owner
of

did
not
however
terminate
with
the

still
under
the
influence
of

when
it
was
whispered
that

was
full
of
nice
old
furniture
and
that
a
few
faithful
servants
of
the
good
old
master
were
its
only
guards
covetous
thoughts
at
once
stirred
the
evil
minds
of
those
who
were
the
representatives
of
law
and
order
this
house
was
left
almost
without
protection
the
war
was
over
south
carolina
had
bent
her
proud
head
in
agony
over
her
burned
plantations
and
desolate
homes
the
victorious
army
was
now
proclaiming
peace
and
generous
treatment
to
a
fallen
foe
then
to
what
an
almost
unimaginable
state
of
demoralization
must
some
of
the
freedmen
protectors
have
fallen
when
they
sent
a
gunboat
to
jehossee
island
and
rifled
the
old
house
of
all
its
treasures
the

favorite
sideboard

no

to
your

stolen
from

firesides
of

restore
them
to
their
owners
or
else
bury
them
out
of

that
they
may
not
be
led
to
believe
that
the

for

of

was
a
war
for
plunder
else
did
brave

and
good

pray
in
vain
away
with
stolen
pianos
captured
sideboards
and
purloined
silver
what
but
this
petty
plundering
could
be
expected
of
men
who
robbed
by
wholesale
the
poor
negro
to
protect
whose
rights
they
were
sent
south
the
great
political
party
of
the
north
became
the
pledged
conservator
of
the
black
rights
and
established
a
freedman
bureau
and
freedman
banks
to
guard
his
humble
earnings
all
know
something
of
the
workings
of
those
banks
and
to
everlasting
infamy
must
be
consigned
the
names
of
many
of
those
conducting
them
men
who
robbed
every
one
of
these
depositories
of
negro
savings
and
left
the
poor
freedman
in
a
physical
state
of
destitution
and
in
a
perfect
bewilderment
of
mind
as
to
who
his
true
friend
really
was
a
faithful
negro
of
jehossee
island
was
but
one
among
thousands
of
such
cases
while
the
tumult
of
war
vexed
the
land
the
faithful
negro
overseer
remained
at
his
post
to
guard
his
late
master
property
supporting
himself
by
the
manufacture
of
salt
and
living
in
the
most
frugal
manner
to
be
able
to
lay
by
a
sum
for
his
old
age
having
saved
five
hundred
dollars
he
deposited
them
in
the
nearest
freedman
bank
which
though
fathered
by
the
united
states
government
failed
and
the
now
destitute
negro
found
himself
stripped
in
the
same
moment
of
his
savings
and
his
confidence
in
his
new
protectors
as
the
war
of
the
rebellion
was
slowly
drawing
to
its
close
lincoln
kind
heart
was
drawn
towards
his
erring
countrymen
and
he
made
a
list
of
the
names
of
the
wisest
and
best
men
of
the
south
who
not
having
taken
an
active
part
in
the
strife
might
be
intrusted
with
the
task
of
bringing
back
the
unruly
states
to
their
constitutional
relations
with
the
national
government
governor
aiken
was
informed
that
his
name
was
upon
that
list
and
he
would
gladly
have
accepted
the
onerous
position
and
labored
in
the
true
interests
of
the
whole
people
but
the
pistol
of
an
assassin
closed
the
life
of
the
president
whose
generous
plans
of
reconstruction
were
never
realized
in
the
birth
of
our
new
centennial
let
us
eschew
the
political
charlatan
and
bring
forward
our
statesmen
to
serve
and
govern
a
people
who
to
become
a
unit
of
strength
must
ever
bear
in
mind
the
words
of
the
great
southern
statesman
who
said
he
knew
no
north
no
south
no
east
no
west
but
one
undivided
country
on
monday
at
ten
two
negroes
assisted
me
to
launch
my
craft
from
the
river
bank
at
the
mouth
of
the
canal
for
the
tide
was
very
low
as
i
settled
myself
for
a
long
pull
at
the
oars
the
face
of
one
of
the
blacks
was
seemingly
rent
in
twain
as
a
huge
mouth
opened
and
a
pair
of
strong
lungs
sent
forth
these
parting
words
bully
for
massachusetts
how
did
you
know
i
came
from
massachusetts
i
called
out
from
the
river

two
miles
further
on
bull
creek
served
me
as
a
and
half
an
hour
after
entering
it
the
tide
was
flooding
against
me
when
goat
island
creek
was
passed
on
the
left
hand
knots
of
pine
forests
rose
picturesquely
in
places
out
of
the
and
an
hour
later
at
bennett
point
on
the
right
i
found
the
watercourse
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
width
the
surroundings
were
of
a
lovely
nature
during
this
day
journey
here
marshes
diversified
by
occasional
hammocks
of
timber
dotting
their
uninteresting
wastes
there
humble
habitations
of
whites
and
blacks
appearing
at
intervals
in
the
forest
growth
as
i
was
destitute
of
a
finished
chart
of
the
coast
survey
after
rowing
along
one
side
of
hutchinson
island
i
became
bewildered
in
the
maze
of
creeks
which
penetrate
the
marshes
that
lie
between
point
and
the
coast
making
a
rough
topographical
sketch
of
the
country
as
i
descended
hutchinson
creek
or
big
river
the
latter
appellation
being
the
most
appropriate
as
it
is
a
very
wide
watercourse
i
came
upon
a
group
of
low
islands
and
found
upon
one
of
them
a
plantation
which
had
been
abandoned
to
the
negroes
and
the
little
bluff
upon
which
two
or
three
rickety
buildings
were
situated
was
the
last
land
which
remained
unsubmerged
during
a
high
tide
between
the
plantation
and
the
sea
i
was
now
in
a
quandary
i
had
left
the
hospitable
residence
of
governor
aiken
at
ten
when
i
should
have
departed
at
sunrise
in
order
to
have
had
time
to
enter
and
pass
through
helena
sound
before
night
came
on
the
prospect
of
obtaining
shelter
was
indeed
dismal
just
at
this
time
a
loud
shout
from
the
negroes
on
shore
attracted
my
attention
and
i
rested
upon
my
oars
while
a
of
women
and
children
paddled
out
to
me
is
dat
de
little
boat
they
asked
viewing
my
craft
with
curious
eyes
and
is
dat
boat
made
of
paper
they
continued
showing
that
negro
runners
had
posted
the
people
even
in
these
solitary
regions
of
the
approach
of
the
paper
canoe
i
questioned
these
negro
women
about
the
route
but
each
gave
a
different
answer
as
to
the
passage
through
the
horns
to
helena
sound
hurrying
on
through
tortuous
creeks
the
deserted
tract
called
the
horns
was
entered
and
until
sunset
i
followed
one
short
stream
after
another
to
its
source
in
the
reedy
plain
constantly
retracing
the
route
with
the
tide
not
yet
ebbing
strong
enough
to
show
me
a
course
to
the
sound
presently
it
ebbed
more
rapidly
and
i
followed
the
tide
from
one
intricacy
to
another
but
never
found
the
principal
thoroughfare
while
i
was
enveloped
in
reeds
and
at
a
loss
which
way
to
go
the
soft
ripple
of
breaking
waves
struck
my
ear
like
sweet
music
the
sea
was
telling
me
of
its
proximity
carefully
balancing
myself
i
stood
up
in
the
cranky
canoe
and
peering
over
the
grassy
thickets
saw
before
me
the
broad
waters
of
helena
sound
the
fresh
salt
breeze
from
the
ocean
struck
upon
my
forehead
and
nerved
me
to
a
renewal
of
my
efforts
to
get
within
a
region
of
higher
land
and
to
a
place
of
shelter
the
ebbing
tide
was
yet
high
and
through
the
forest
of
vegetation
and
over
the
submerged
coast
i
pushed
the
canoe
into
the
sound
now
i
rowed
as
though
for
my
life
closely
skirting
the
marshes
and
soon
entered
waters
covered
by
a
chart
in
my
possession
my
course
was
to
skirt
the
coast
of
the
sound
from
where
i
had
entered
it
and
cross
the
mouths
of
the
combahee
and
bull
rivers
to
the
entrance
of
the
broad
coosaw
this
last
river
i
would
ascend
seven
miles
to
the
first
upland
and
camp
thereon
until
morning
the
tide
was
now
against
me
and
the
night
was
growing
darker
as
the
faithful
craft
was
forced
along
the
marshes
four
miles
to
the
mouth
of
the
combahee
river
which
i
had
to
ascend
half
a
mile
to
get
rid
of
a
shoal
of
frisky
porpoises
who
were
fishing
in
the
current
then
descending
it
on
the
opposite
shore
i
rowed
two
miles
further
in
the
dark
but
for
half
an
hour
previous
to
my
reaching
the
wide
debouchure
of
bull
river
some
enormous
blackfish
surged
about
me
in
the
tideway
and
sounded
their
nasal
calls
while
their
more
demonstrative
porpoise
neighbors
leaped
from
the
water
in
the
misty
atmosphere
and
so
alarmed
me
and
occupied
my
attention
that
instead
of
crossing
to
the
coosaw
river
i
unwittingly
ascended
the
bull
and
was
soon
lost
in
the
contours
of
the
river
as
i
hugged
the
marshy
borders
of
the
stream
to
escape
the
strong
current
of
its
channel
and
rowed
on
and
on
in
the
gloom
eagerly
scanning
the
high
flats
to
find
one
little
spot
of
firm
upland
upon
which
i
might
land
my
canoe
and
obtain
a
for
myself
for
the
night
the
feeling
that
i
was
lost
was
not
the
most
cheerful
to
be
imagined
in
the
thin
fog
which
arose
from
the
warm
water
into
the
cool
night
air
objects
on
the
marshes
assumed
fantastical
shapes
a
few
reeds
taller
than
the
rest
had
the
appearance
of
trees
twenty
feet
high
so
real
did
these
unreal
images
seem
that
i
drove
my
canoe
against
the
soft
muddy
bank
repeatedly
prompted
to
land
in
what
seemed
a
copse
of
low
trees
but
in
every
instance
i
was
deceived
still
i
pulled
up
that
mysterious
river
ignorant
at
the
time
of
even
its
name
praying
only
for
one
little
spot
of
upland
where
i
might
camp
while
thus
employed
i
peered
over
my
shoulder
into
the
gloom
and
beheld
what
seemed
to
be
a
vision
for
out
of
a
cloud
of
mist
rose
the
skeleton
lines
of
a
large
ship
with
all
its
sails
furled
to
the
yards
a
ship
at
anchor
and
in
this
place
i
ejaculated
scarcely
believing
my
eyes
but
when
i
pointed
the
canoe
towards
it
and
again
looked
over
my
shoulder
the
vision
of
hope
was
gone
again
i
saw
tall
masts
cutting
through
the
mists
but
the
ship
hull
could
not
be
distinguished
and
as
i
rowed
towards
the
objects
first
the
lower
masts
disappeared
then
the
topmasts
dissolved
and
later
the
topgallant
and
royal
masts
faded
away
for
half
an
hour
i
rowed
and
rowed
for
that
mysterious
vessel
which
was
veiled
and
unveiled
to
my
sight
never
did
so
spectral
an
object
haunt
or
thwart
me
it
seemed
to
change
its
position
on
the
water
as
well
as
in
the
atmosphere
and
i
was
too
busily
employed
in
trying
to
reach
it
to
discover
in
the
darkness
that
the
current
which
i
could
not
distinguish
from
smooth
water
was
whirling
me
down
stream
as
fast
as
i
would
approach
the
weird
vessel
drawing
once
more
from
the
current
i
followed
the
marsh
until
the
canoe
was
opposite
the
anchorage
of
a
real
ship
then
with
hearty
pulls
i
shot
around
its
stern
and
shouted
ship
ahoy
no
one
answered
the
hail
the
vessel
looked
like
a
but
not
of
american
build
not
a
light
gleamed
from
her
ports
not
a
footfall
came
from
her
decks
she
seemed
to
be
deserted
in
the
middle
of
the
river
surrounded
by
a
desolate
waste
of
marshes
the
current
gurgled
and
sucked
about
her
run
as
the
ebbtide
washed
her
black
hull
on
its
way
to
the
sea
the
spectacle
seemed
now
even
more
mysterious
than
when
it
peered
forth
from
a
cloud
of
mist
but
it
was
real
and
not
fantastic
another
hail
louder
than
the
first
went
forth
into
the
night
air
and
penetrated
to
the
ship
forecastle
for
a
sailor
answered
my
call
and
reported
to
the
captain
in
the
cabin
the
presence
of
a
boat
at
the
ship
side
a
quick
firm
tread
sounded
upon
the
deck
then
with
a
light
bound
a
young
man
landed
upon
the
high
rail
of
the
vessel
he
peered
down
from
his
stately
ship
upon
the
little
speck
which
floated
upon
the
gurgling
current
then
with
a
voice
filled
with
the
fogs
of
the
ocean
he
thundered
forth
as
though
he
were
hailing
a
what
boat
that
paper
canoe
maria
theresa
i
replied
in
as
foggy
a
voice
as
i
could
assume
where
from
and
where
bound
again
roared
the
captain
from
quebec
canada
and
bound
to
sleep
on
board
your
vessel
if
i
can
ever
get
up
there
i
politely
responded
in
a
more
subdued
voice
for
i
soon
discovered
that
nature
had
never
intended
me
for
a
ah
is
it
you
cheerily
responded
the
captain
suddenly
dispensing
with
all
his
fogginess
i
been
looking
for
you
this
long
time
got
a
charleston
paper
on
board
your
trip
all
in
it
come
up
and
break
a
bottle
of
wine
with
me
all
hands
came
from
the
forecastle
and
finland
mates
and
finland
sailors
speaking
both
english
and
russian
crowded
to
the
rail
to
receive
the
paper
canoe
which
had
first
been
described
to
them
by
english
newspapers
when
the
vessel
lay
in
a
british
port
awaiting
the
which
afterwards
sent
them
to
bull
river
south
carolina
for
a
load
of
phosphates
the
jolly
crew
lowered
buntlines
and
clewlines
to
which
i
attached
my
boat
stores
these
were
hoisted
up
the
high
sides
of
the
ship
and
after
bending
on
a
line
to
the
bow
and
stern
rings
of
the
canoe
i
ascended
by
the
ladder
while
captain
johs
bergelund
and
his
mates
claimed
the
pleasure
of
landing
the
paper
canoe
on
the
deck
of
the
rurik
the
tiny
shell
looked
very
small
as
she
rested
on
the
broad
white
decks
of
the
emperor
of
russia
old
steam
yacht
which
bore
the
name
of
the
founder
of
the
russian
empire
though
now
a
bark
and
not
a
steamer
though
a
freighter
and
not
a
royal
yacht
the
rurik
looked
every
inch
a
government
vessel
for
her
young
captain
with
a
sailor
pride
kept
her
in
a
thorough
state
of
cleanliness
and
order
we
went
to
supper
the
captain
his
mates
and
the
stranger
gathered
around
the
board
while
the
generous
sailor
brought
out
his
curious
bottles
and
put
them
by
the
side
of
the
still
more
curious
dishes
of
food
all
my
surroundings
were
those
of
the
country
of
the
midnight
sun
and
i
should
have
felt
more
bewildered
than
when
in
the
fog
i
viewed
and
chased
this
ship
had
not
captain
bergelund
in
most
excellent
english
entertained
me
with
a
flow
of
conversation
which
put
me
at
my
ease
he
discoursed
of
finland
where
lakes
covered
the
country
from
near
abo
its
chief
city
to
the
far
north
where
the
summer
days
are
nearly
all
night
long
painting
in
high
colors
the
delights
of
his
native
land
he
begged
me
to
visit
it
finally
as
midnight
drew
near
this
genial
sailor
insisted
upon
putting
me
in
his
own
comfortable
stateroom
while
he
slept
upon
a
lounge
in
the
cabin
one
mile
above
the
rurik
anchorage
was
the
of
the
pacific
company
which
was
supplying
captain
bergelund
by
lighters
with
his
freight
of
unground
fertilizer
the
next
morning
i
took
leave
of
the
rurik
but
instead
of
descending
the
bull
river
to
the
coosaw
i
determined
to
save
time
by
crossing
the
peninsula
between
the
two
rivers
by
means
of
two
short
creeks
which
were
connected
at
their
sources
by
a
very
short
canal
near
the
mines
of
the
phosphate
company
when
i
entered
horse
island
creek
at
eleven
the
tide
was
on
the
last
of
the
ebb
and
i
sat
in
the
canoe
a
long
time
awaiting
the
flood
to
float
me
up
the
wide
ditch
which
would
conduct
me
to
the
creek
that
emptied
into
the
coosaw
upon
the
banks
of
the
canal
three
hours
were
lost
waiting
for
the
tide
to
give
me
one
foot
of
water
when
i
rowed
into
the
second
watercourse
and
late
in
the
afternoon
entered
the
wide
coosaw
the
two
creeks
and
the
connecting
canal
are
called
the
haulover
creek
as
i
turned
up
the
coosaw
and
skirted
the
now
submerged
marshes
of
its
left
bank
two
were
at
work
up
the
river
raising
the
remains
of
the
marine
monsters
of
antiquity
the
strong
wind
and
swashing
seas
being
in
my
favor
the
canoe
soon
arrived
opposite
the
spot
of
upland
i
had
so
longed
to
reach
the
previous
night
this
was
chisolm
landing
back
of
which
were
the
phosphate
works
of
the
coosaw
mine
company
the
inspector
of
phosphates
john
hunn
offered
me
the
hospitality
of
alligator
hall
where
he
and
some
of
the
gentlemen
employed
by
the
company
resided
in
bachelor
retirement
my
host
described
a
mammal
tooth
that
weighed
nearly
fourteen
pounds
which
had
been
taken
from
a
phosphate
mine
it
had
been
sent
to
a
public
room
at
beaufort
south
carolina
a
fossil
shark
tooth
weighing
four
and
a
half
pounds
was
also
found
and
a
learned
ichthyologist
has
asserted
that
the
owner
of
this
remarkable
relic
of
the
past
must
have
been
one
hundred
feet
in
length
beaufort
was
near
at
hand
and
could
be
easily
reached
by
entering
brickyard
creek
the
entrance
of
which
was
on
the
right
bank
of
the
coosaw
nearly
opposite
chisolm
landing
it
was
nearly
six
miles
by
this
creek
to
beaufort
and
from
that
town
to
port
royal
sound
by
following
beaufort
river
was
a
distance
of
eleven
miles
the
mouth
of
beaufort
river
is
only
two
miles
from
the
sea
preferring
to
follow
a
more
interior
water
route
than
the
beaufort
one
the
canoe
was
rowed
up
the
coosaw
five
miles
to
whale
branch
which
is
crossed
by
the
port
royal
railroad
bridge
whale
branch
five
miles
in
length
empties
into
broad
river
which
i
descended
thirteen
miles
to
the
lower
end
of
daw
island
on
its
right
bank
here
in
this
region
of
marshy
shores
the
chechessee
river
and
the
broad
river
mingle
their
strong
currents
in
port
royal
sound
it
was
dusk
when
the
sound
was
entered
from
the
extreme
end
of
daw
island
where
it
became
necessary
to
cross
immediately
to
skull
creek
at
hilton
head
island
or
go
into
camp
for
the
night
i
looked
down
the
sound
six
miles
to
the
broad
atlantic
which
was
sending
in
clouds
of
mist
on
a
fresh
breeze
i
gazed
across
the
mouth
of
the
chechessee
and
the
sound
at
the
entrance
of
the
port
of
refuge
i
desired
to
traverse
nearly
three
miles
of
this
rough
water
i
would
gladly
have
camped
hut
the
shore
i
was
about
to
leave
offered
to
submerge
me
with
the
next
high
water
no
friendly
hammock
of
trees
could
be
seen
as
i
glided
from
the
shadow
of
the
high
rushes
of
daw
island
circumstances
decided
the
point
in
debate
and
i
rowed
rapidly
into
the
sound
the
canoe
had
not
gone
half
a
mile
when
the
chechessee
river
opened
fully
to
view
and
a
pretty
little
hammock
with
two
or
three
shanties
beneath
its
trees
could
be
plainly
seen
on
island
it
was
now
too
late
to
return
and
ascend
the
river
to
the
hammock
for
the
sound
was
disturbed
by
the
freshening
breeze
from
the
sea
blowing
against
the
which
was
increased
in
power
by
the
outflowing
flume
of
water
from
the
wide
chechessee
it
required
all
the
energy
i
possessed
to
keep
the
canoe
from
being
overrun
by
the
swashy
seas
once
or
twice
i
thought
my
last
struggle
for
life
had
come
but
a
merciful
power
gave
me
the
strength
and
coolness
that
this
trying
ordeal
required
and
i
somehow
weathered
the
dangerous
oyster
reefs
above
skull
creek
and
landed
at
seabrook
plantation
upon
hilton
head
island
near
two
or
three
old
houses
one
of
which
was
being
fitted
up
as
a
store
by
kleim
of
the
first
new
york
volunteers
who
had
lived
on
the
island
since
kleim
took
me
to
his
bachelor
quarters
where
the
wet
cargo
of
the
maria
theresa
was
dried
by
the
kitchen
fireplace
the
next
day
february
i
left
seabrook
and
followed
skull
creek
to
mackay
creek
and
passing
the
mouth
of
may
river
entered
calibogue
sound
where
a
sudden
tempest
arose
and
drove
me
into
a
creek
which
flowed
out
of
the
marshes
of
bull
island
a
few
negro
huts
were
discovered
on
a
low
mound
of
earth
the
blacks
told
me
their
hammock
was
called
bird
island
the
tempest
lasted
all
day
and
as
no
shelter
could
be
found
on
the
creek
a
darky
hauled
my
canoe
on
a
cart
a
couple
of
miles
to
bull
creek
which
enters
into
cooper
river
one
of
the
watercourses
i
was
to
enter
from
calibogue
sound
upon
reaching
the
wooded
shores
of
bull
creek
my
carter
introduced
me
to
the
head
man
of
the
settlement
a
little
old
creature
called
cuffy
who
though
respectful
in
his
demeanor
to
de
was
cross
and
overbearing
to
the
few
families
occupying
the
shanties
in
the
magnificent
grove
of
which
shaded
them
cuffy
or
kitchen
which
was
a
log
structure
measuring
nine
by
ten
feet
with
posts
only
three
feet
high
was
the
only
building
which
could
be
emptied
of
its
contents
for
my
accommodation
our
contract
or
lease
was
a
verbal
one
cuffy
terms
being
whateber
de
white
man

to
gib
an
ole
nigger
cuffy
cut
a
big
switch
and
sent
in
his
darter
a
girl
of
about
fourteen
years
to
clean
out
the
shanty
when
she
did
not
move
fast
enough
to
suit
the
old
man
wishes
he
switched
her
over
the
shoulders
till
it
excited
my
pity
but
the
girl
seemed
to
take
the
beating
as
an
amusement
for
it
made
no
impression
on
her
hard
skull
and
thick
skin
after
commencing
to
keep
house
the
old
women
came
to
sell
me
eggs
and
beg
for
bacca
they
requested
me
never
to
throw
away
my
as
it
made
coffee
good
for
black
folks
i
distributed
some
of
my
stores
among
them
and
after
cutting
rushes
and
boughs
for
my
bed
turned
in
for
the
night
these
negroes
had
been
raising
cotton
but
the
price
having
declined
to
five
cents
a
pound
they
could
not
get
cents
a
day
for
their
labor
by
cultivating
it
the
fierce
wind
subsided
before
dawn
but
a
heavy
fog
covered
the
marshes
and
the
creek
cuffy
settlement
turned
out
before
sunrise
to
see
me
off
and
the
canoe
soon
reached
the
broad
cooper
river
which
i
ascended
in
the
misty
darkness
by
following
close
to
the
left
bank
four
miles
up
the
cooper
river
from
calibogue
sound
there
is
a
passage
through
the
marshes
from
the
cooper
to
new
river
which
is
called
ram
horn
creek
on
the
right
of
its
entrance
a
hammock
rises
from
the
marsh
and
is
called
page
island
about
midway
between
the
two
rivers
and
along
this
crooked
thoroughfare
is
another
piece
of
upland
called
pine
island
inhabited
by
the
families
of
two
while
navigating
cooper
river
as
the
heavy
mists
rolled
in
clouds
over
the
quiet
waters
a
rowed
by
negroes
emerged
from
the
gloom
and
as
suddenly
disappeared
i
shouted
after
them
please
tell
me
the
name
of
the
next
creek
a
hoarse
voice
came
back
to
me
from
the
cloud
pull
and
be
d
then
all
was
still
as
night
again
to
solve
this
seemingly
uncourteous
reply
so
unusual
in
the
south
i
consulted
the
manuscript
charts
which
the
charleston
pilots
had
kindly
drawn
for
my
use
and
found
that
the
negroes
had
spoken
geographically
as
well
as
truthfully
for
pine
island
creek
is
known
to
the
watermen
as
pull
and
be
d
creek
on
account
of
its
tortuous
character
and
chiefly
because
as
the
tides
head
in
it
if
a
boat
enters
it
from
one
river
with
a
favorable
tide
it
has
a
strong
head
current
on
the
other
side
of
the
middle
ground
to
oppose
it
thus
pulling
at
the
oars
at
some
parts
of
the
creek
becomes
hard
work
for
the
boatmen
hence
this
name
which
though
profane
may
be
considered
geographical
after
leaving
the
cooper
river
the
watercourses
to
savannah
were
discolored
by
red
or
yellow
mud
from
pine
island
i
descended
new
river
two
miles
and
a
half
to
wall
cut
which
is
only
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
length
and
through
which
i
entered
wright
river
following
it
a
couple
of
miles
to
the
broad
yellow
turbulent
current
of
the
savannah
my
thoughts
now
naturally
turned
to
the
early
days
of
steamboat
enterprise
when
this
river
as
well
as
the
hudson
was
conspicuous
for
though
the
steamer
savannah
was
not
the
first
vessel
which
cut
the
waves
of
the
atlantic
she
was
the
first
steamer
that
ever
crossed
it
let
us
examine
historical
data
colonel
john
stevens
of
new
york
built
the
steamboat
phoenix
about
the
year
and
was
prevented
from
using
it
upon
the
hudson
river
by
the
fulton
and
livingston
monopoly
charter
the
phoenix
made
an
ocean
voyage
to
the
delaware
river
the
first
english
venture
was
that
of
the
steamer
caledonia
which
made
a
passage
to
holland
in
the
london
times
of
may
printed
in
its
issue
of
that
date
the
following
item
great

a
new
vessel
of
three

for
the
express
purpose
of
carrying
passengers
across
the

she
is
to
come
to
liverpool
direct
this
steamer
was
the
savannah
and
the
bold
projector
of
this
experiment
of
sending
a
steamboat
across
the

was
daniel
dodd
the
savannah
was
built
in

york
by
francis
ficket
for
dodd
stephen

of
morristown
new
jersey
built
her
engines
and
on
the
of
august
she
was
launched
gliding
gracefully
into
the
element
which
was
to
bear
her
to
foreign
lands
there
to
be
crowned
with
the
laurels
of
success
on
may
this
purely
vessel
left
savannah
and
glided
out
from
this
waste
of
marshes
under
the
command
of
captain
moses
rogers
with
stephen
rogers
as
navigator
the
port
of
new
london
had
furnished
these
able
seamen
the
steamer
reached
liverpool
june
the
passage
having
occupied
days
upon
eighteen
of
which
she
had
used
her
paddles
a
son
of
dodd
once
told
me
of
the
sensation
produced
by
the
arrival
of
a
smoking
vessel
on
the
coast
of
ireland
and
how
lieutenant
john
bowie
of
the
king
cutter
kite
sent
a
of
sailors
to
board
the
savannah
to
assist
her
crew
to
extinguish
the
fires
of
what
his
officers
supposed
to
be
a
burning
ship
the
savannah
after
visiting
liverpool
continued
her
voyage
on
july
and
reached
petersburg
in
safety
leaving
the
latter
port
on
october
this
adventurous
craft
completed
the
round
voyage
upon
her
arrival
at
savannah
november
i
pulled
up
the
savannah
until
within
five
miles
of
the
city
and
then
left
the
river
on
its
south
side
where
old
are
first
met
and
entered
augustine
creek
which
is
the
steamboat
thoroughfare
of
the
inland
route
to
florida
just
outside
the
city
of
savannah
near
its
beautiful
cemetery
where
tall
trees
with
their
graceful
drapery
of
spanish
moss
screen
from
wind
and
sun
the
quiet
of
the
dead
my
canoe
was
landed
and
stored
in
a
building
of
the
german
greenwich
shooting
park
where
john
hellwig
in
a
most
hospitable
manner
cared
for
it
and
its
owner
while
awaiting
the
arrival
of
letters
at
the
savannah
many
of
the
ladies
of
that
beautiful
city
came
out
to
see
the
paper
canoe
they
seemed
to
have
the
mistaken
idea
that
my
little
craft
had
come
from
the
distant
dominion
of
canada
over
the
atlantic
ocean
they
also
looked
upon
the
voyage
of
the
paper
canoe
as
a
very
sentimental
thing
while
the
canoeist
had
found
it
an
intensely
practical
affair
though
occasionally
relieved
by
incidents
of
romantic
or
amusing
character
as
the
ladies
clustered
round
the
boat
while
it
rested
upon
the
of
hellwig
parlor
they
questioned
me
freely
tell
us
they
said
what
were
your
thoughts
while
you
rowed
upon
the
broad
ocean
in
the
lonely
hours
of
night
though
unwilling
to
break
their
pleasing
illusions
i
was
obliged
to
inform
them
that
a
sensible
canoeist
is
usually
enjoying
his
needed
rest
in
some
camp
or
sleeping
in
some
sheltered
place
under
a
roof
if
possible
after
it
is
too
dark
to
travel
in
safety
and
as
to
ocean
travelling
the
canoe
had
only
once
entered
upon
the
atlantic
ocean
and
then
through
a
mistake
but
what
subjects
occupy
your
thoughts
as
you
row
and
row
and
row
all
day
by
yourself
in
this
little
ship
a
motherly
lady
inquired
to
tell
you
honestly
ladies
i
must
say
that
when
i
am
in
shallow
watercourses
with
the
tides
usually
ebbing
at
the
wrong
time
for
my
convenience
i
am
so
full
of
anxiety
about
getting
wrecked
on
the
reefs
of
sharp
that
i
am
wishing
myself
in
deep
water
and
when
my
route
forces
me
into
the
deep
water
of
sounds
and
the
surface
becomes
tossed
into
wild
disorder
by
strong
currents
and
stronger
winds
and
the
porpoises
pay
me
their
little
attentions
chasing
the
canoe
flapping
their
tails
and
showing
their
sportive
dispositions
i
think
longingly
of
those
same
shoal
creeks
and
wish
i
was
once
more
in
their
shallow
waters
we
ladies
have
prayed
for
your
safety
said
a
german
lady
and
we
will
pray
that
your
voyage
may
have
a
happy
and
successful
end
when
the
ladies
left
two
irish
laborers
dressed
in
sombre
black
with
high
hats
worn
with
the
air
of
dignity
examined
the
boat
there
was
an
absence
of
the
sparkle
of
fun
usually
seen
in
the
irish
face
for
this
was
a
serious
occasion
they
did
not
see
any
romance
or
sentiment
in
the
voyage
but
took
a
broad
geographical
view
of
the
matter
they
stood
silently
gazing
at
the
canoe
with
the
same
air
of
solemnity
they
would
have
given
a
corpse
then
one
addressed
the
other
as
though
the
owner
of
the
craft
was
entirely
out
of
the
hearing
of
their
conversation
said
no
and
what
did
i
tell
ye
pater
and
so
ye
did
replied
no
and
did
i
say
so
continued
no
of
course
ye
did
and
was
me
of
the
same
mind
to
be
sure
responded
yes
i
told
ye
as
how
it
is
the
men
of
these
times
is
greater
than
the
men
of
ould
times
there
was
the
great
coolumbus
who
came
over
in
three
ships
to
see
americky
what
did
he
know
about
paper
boats
nothing
at
all
at
all
he
cum
over
in
big
ships
while
this
young
feller
has
cum
all
the
way
from
canada
i
tell
ye
the
men
of
ould
times
was
not
up
to
the
men
of
these
times
thin
there
captain
boyton
who
do
use
any
boat
or
ship
at
all
at
all
but
goes
aswimming
in
rubber

to
keep
him
dry
all
over
the
atlantic
oshin
jis
look
man
how
he
landed
on
the
shores
of
ould
ireland
not
long
since
now
what
coolumbus
or
any
other
man
of
the
past
ages
to
him
coolumbus
could
not
hold
a
candle
to
boyton
no
i
tell
ye
agen
that
the
men
of
this
age
is
greater
than
the
men
of
the
past
ages
and
broke
in
there
a
britisher
who
gone
to
the
river
niles
in
a
canoe
the
river
niles
hotly
exclaimed
no
do
waste
your
breath
on
that
thing
it
no
new
thing
at
all
at
all
it
was
diskivered
a
long
time
a
go
and
nobody
cares
a
fig
for
it
now
yet
responded
some
of
those
people
were
very
enterprising
there
was
that
great
traveller
robinson
crusoe
ye
must
confess
he
was
a
great
man
for
his
time
the
same
who
wint
to
the
south
sea
islands
and
settled
there
asked
the
first
biographer
the
very
same
man
replied
with
animation
this
instructive
conversation
was
here
interrupted
by
a
party
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
in
turn
gave
their
views

resumed
my

lay
through
the

islands
of

as
far
south
as
the
state
boundary
cumberland

and
the

this

after

steamers
run
from

through
these
interesting
interior
to
the
ports
of
the
john

florida
and
by
taking
this
route
the
traveller
can
escape
a
most
uninteresting
railroad
journey
from
savannah
to
jacksonville
where
sandy
soils
and
pine
forests
present
an
uninviting
prospect
to
the
eye
a
little
dredging
in
a
few
places
along
the
steamboat
route
should
be
done
at
national
cost
to
make
this
a
more
convenient
and
expeditious
tidal
route
for
vessels
leaving
greenwich
bonaventure
and
thunderbolt
behind
me
on
the
upland
the
canoe
entered
the
great
marshy
district
of
the
coast
along
the
wilmington
and
skiddaway
rivers
to
skiddaway
narrows
which
is
a
contracted
crooked
watercourse
connecting
the
skiddaway
with
the
burnside
river
the
low
lands
were
made
picturesque
by
hammocks
some
of
which
were
cultivated
in
leaving
the
burnside
for
the
broad
vernon
river
as
the
canoe
approached
the
sea
one
of
the
sudden
tempests
which
frequently
vex
these
arose
and
drove
me
to
a
hammock
in
the
marshes
of
green
island
on
the
left
bank
and
opposite
the
mouth
of
the
little
ogeechee
river
green
island
has
been
well
cultivated
in
the
past
but
is
now
only
the
summer
home
of
styles
its
owner
two
or
three
families
of
negroes
inhabited
the
cabins
and
looked
after
the
property
of
the
absent
proprietor
i
waded
to
my
knees
in
the
mud
before
the
canoe
could
be
landed
and
as
it
stormed
all
night
i
slept
on
the
floor
of
the
humble
cot
of
the
negro
echard
holmes
having
first
treated
the
household
to
crackers
and
coffee
the
negroes
gathered
from
other
points
to
examine
the
canoe
and
hearing
that
i
was
from

from
the

mansion
it
was
but
three
miles
to
ossabaw
sound
little
don
island
and
raccoon
key
are
in
the
mouth
of
the
vernon
between
the
two
flat
islands
is
a
deep
passage
through
which
the
tides
rush
with
great
force
it
is
called
hell
gate
on
the
south
side
of
raccoon
key
the
great
ogeechee
river
pours
its
strong
volume
of
water
into
ossabaw
sound
i
entered
the
great
ogeechee
through
the
don
island
passage
and
saw
at
work
with
their
nets
along
the
shores
of
ossabaw
one
of
the
sea
islands
ossabaw
island
lies
between
ossabaw
and
sounds
and
is
eight
miles
long
and
six
miles
wide
the
side
towards
the
sea
is
firm
upland
diversified
with
glades
while
the
western
portion
is
principally
marshes
cut
up
by
numerous
creeks
all
the
sea
islands
produce
the
long
staple
cotton
known
as
cotton
and
before
the
war
a
very
valuable
variety
a
few
negroes
occupy
the
places
abandoned
by
the
proprietor
and
eke
out
a
scanty
livelihood
there
are
many
deer
in
the
forests
of
ossabaw
island
one
of
its
late
proprietors
informed
me
that
there
must
be
at
least
ten
thousand
wild
hogs
there
as
they
have
been
multiplying
for
many
years
and
but
few
were
shot
by
the
negroes
the
domestic
hog
becomes
a
very
shy
animal
if
left
to
himself
for
two
or
three
years
the
hunter
may
search
for
him
without
a
dog
almost
in
vain
though
the
woods
may
contain
large
numbers
of
these
creatures
the
weather
was
now
delightful
and
had
i
possessed
a
light
tent
i
would
not
have
sought
shelter
at
night
in
a
human
habitation
anywhere
along
the
route
the
malaria
which
arises
from
sinks
in
many
of
the
sea
islands
during
the
summer
months
did
not
now
make
dangerous
to
the
health
crossing
the
great
ogeechee
above
middle
marsh
island
i
followed
the
river
to
the
creek
called
florida
passage
through
which
i
reached
bear
river
with
its
wide
and
long
reaches
and
descended
it
to
catherine
sound
now
the
sea
opened
to
full
view
as
the
canoe
crossed
the
tidal
ocean
gateway
two
miles
to
north
newport
river
when
four
miles
up
the
newport
i
entered
johnson
creek
which
flows
from
north
to
south
newport
rivers
by
means
of
the
creek
and
the
south
newport
river
my
little
craft
was
navigated
down
to
the
southern
end
of
catherine
island
to
the
sound
of
the
same
name
and
here
another
inlet
was
crossed
at
sunset
and
high
point
of
sapelo
island
was
reached
from
among
the
green
trees
of
the
high
bluff
a
mansion
which
exhibited
the
taste
of
its
builder
rose
imposingly
this
was
however
but
one
of
the
many
edifices
that
are
tombs
of
buried
hopes
the
proprietor
a
northern
gentleman
after
the
war
purchased
of
sapelo
island
for
thousand
dollars
in
gold
he
attempted
as
many
other
enterprising
northerners
had
done
to
give
the
late
slave
a
chance
to
prove
his
worth
as
a
freedman
to
the
world
pay
the
negro
wages
treat
him
as
you
would
treat
a
white
man
and
he
will
reward
your
confidence
with
industry
and
gratitude
so
thought
and
so
acted
the
northern
colonel
he
built
a
large
mansion
engaged
his
freedmen
paid
them
for
their
work
and
treated
them
like
men
the
result
was
ruin
and
simply
because
he
had
not
paused
to
consider
that
the
negro
had
not
been
born
a
freedman
and
that
the
demoralization
of
slavery
was
still
upon
him
beside
which
facts
we
must
also
place
certain
ethnological
and
moral
principles
which
exist
in
the
pure
negro
type
and
which
are
entirely
overlooked
by
those
philanthropic
persons
who
have
rarely
if
ever
seen
a
negro
but
affect
to
understand
him
through
his
brother
the
mulatto
mud
river
opened
its
wide
mouth
before
me
as
i
left
the
inlet
but
the
tide
was
very
low
and
mud
river
is
a
in
the
passage
of
the
florida
steamers
it
became
so
dark
that
i
was
obliged
to
get
near
the
shore
to
make
a
landing
my
attempt
was
made
opposite
a
negro
house
which
was
on
a
bluff
but
the
water
had
receded
into
the
very
narrow
channel
of
mud
river
and
i
was
soon
stuck
fast
on
a
flat
getting
overboard
i
sank
to
my
knees
in
the
soft
mud
i
called
for
help
and
was
answered
by
a
tall
darky
who
with
a
gun
left
his
house
and
stood
in
a
threatening
manner
on
the
shore
i
appealed
for
help
and
said
i
wished
to
go
ashore
den
cum
de
best
way
you
can
he
answered
in
a
surly
manner
what
duz
you
want
here
any
way
what
duz
you
want
on
plantation
anyhow
i
explained
to
this
ugly
black
that
i
was
a
northern
man
travelling
to
see
the
country
and
wished
to
camp
near
his
house
for
protection
and
promised
if
he
would
aid
me
to
land
that
i
would
convince
him
of
my
honest
purpose
by
showing
him
the
contents
of
my
canoe
and
would
prove
to
him
that
i
was
no
enemy
to
the
colored
man
i
told
him
of
the
maps
the
letters
and
the
blankets
which
were
in
the
little
canoe
now
so
fast
in
the
mud
and
what
a
loss
it
would
be
if
some
marauder
passing
on
the
next
high
tide
should
steal
my
boat
the
fellow
slowly
lowered
his
gun
which
had
been
held
in
a
threatening
position
and
said
nobody
knows
his
friends
in
dese
times
had
a
boat
stealed
by
some
white
man
and
spose
you
was
cumin
to

cheers
and
beds
and
ebryting
out
ob
de
house
sens
de
war
all
rascals
it
was
a
wearisome
and
dangerous
job
for
me
to
navigate
the
canoe
over
the
soft
slippery
mud
to
the
firm
shore
as
there
were
unfathomed
places
in
the
flats
which
might
ingulf
or
entomb
me
at
any
step
but
the
task
was
completed
and
i
stood
face
to
face
with
the
now
half
tranquillized
negro
before
removing
the
mud
that
hung
upon
me
to
the
waist
in
heavy
clods
i
showed
the
darky
my
and
explained
the
object
of
my
mission
he
was
very
intelligent
and
after
asking
a
few
questions
said
to
his
son
take
dis
gun
to
de
house
and
then
turning
to
me
continued
dis
is
de
sort
ob
man

how
to

white
man
and

now
knows
you
is
a
gemmin
wo
treat
you
like
a
nigger
gib
you
best
got
cum
to
de
house
when
inside
of
the
house
of
this
resolute
black
every
attention
was
paid
to
my
comfort
the
cargo
of
the
paper
canoe
was
piled
up
in
one
corner
of
the
room
the
wife
and
children
sat
before
the
bright
fire
and
listened
to
the
story
of
my
cruise
i
doctored
the
sick
pickaninny
of
my
host
and
made
the
family
a
pot
of
strong
coffee
this
negro
could
read
but
he
asked
me
to
address
a
label
he
wished
to
attach
to
a
bag
of
cotton
of
one
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
weight
which
he
had
raised
and
was
to
ship
by
the
steamboat
lizzie
baker
to
a
mercantile
house
in
savannah
as
i
rested
upon
my
blankets
which
were
spread
upon
the
floor
of
the
only
comfortable
room
in
the
house
at
intervals
during
the
night
the
large
form
of
the
black
stole
softly
in
and
bent
over
me
to
see
if
i
were
well
covered
up
and
he
as
noiselessly
piled
sticks
upon
the
dying
embers
to
dry
up
the
dampness
which
rose
from
the
river
he
brought
me
a
basin
of
cold
water
in
the
morning
and
not
possessing
a
towel
clean
enough
for
a
white
man
he
insisted
that
i
should
use
his
wife
newly
starched
calico
apron
to
wipe
my
face
and
hands
upon
when
i
offered
him
money
for
the
night
accommodation
and
the
excellent
oyster
breakfast
that
his
wife
prepared
for
me
he
said
you
may
gib
my
wife
whateber
pleases
you
for
her
cooking
but
nuffin
for
de
food
or
de
lodgings
no
nigger
ef
i
is
a
cullud
man
it
was
now
saturday
and
as
i
rowed
through
the
marsh
thoroughfare
called
new
tea
kettle
creek
which
connects
mud
river
with
doboy
sound
near
the
southern
end
of
sapelo
island
i
calculated
the
chances
of
finding
a
for
sunday
if
i
went
up
to
the
mainland
through
north
and
darien
rivers
to
the
town
of
darien
my
past
experience
taught
me
that
instead
of
enjoying
rest
i
would
become
a
forced
exhibiter
of
the
paper
canoe
to
crowds
of
people
to
avoid
this
i
determined
to
pass
the
day
in
the
first
hammock
that
would
afford
shelter
and
but
as
the
canoe
entered
doboy
sound
which
with
its
inlet
separates
sapelo
from
the
almost
treeless
wolf
island
the
wind
rose
with
such
violence
that
i
was
driven
to
take
refuge
upon
doboy
island
a
small
marshy
territory
the
few
firm
acres
of
which
were
occupied
by
the
settlement
and
steam
of
hiltons
foster
gibson
a
northern
lumber
firm
foreign
and
american
vessels
were
anchored
under
the
lee
of
protecting
marshes
awaiting
their
cargoes
of
sawed
deals
and
hewn
timber
while
rafts
of
logs
which
had
been
borne
upon
the
currents
of
the
altamaha
and
other
streams
from
the
far
interior
regions
of
pine
forests
were
collected
here
and
manufactured
into
lumber
one
of
the
proprietors
a
northern
gentleman
occupied
with
his
family
a
very
comfortable
cottage
near
the
store
and
steam
as
the
doboy
people
had
learned
of
the
approach
of
the
paper
canoe
from
southern
newspapers
the
little
craft
was
identified
as
soon
as
it
touched
the
low
shores
of
the
island
i
could
not
find
any
kind
of
hotel
or
in
this
settlement
of
yankees
canadians
and
negroes
and
was
about
to
leave
it
in
search
of
some
lone
hammock
when
a
mechanic
kindly
offered
me
the
floor
of
an
unfinished
room
in
an
unfinished
house
in
which
i
passed
my
sunday
trying
to
rest
and
obtaining
my
meals
at
a
restaurant
kept
by
a
negro
a
member
of
the
spaulding
family
the
owners
of
a
part
of
sapelo
island
called
upon
me
and
seeing
me
in
such
inhospitable
quarters
with
fleas
in
hundreds
invading
my
blankets
urged
me
to
return
with
him
to
his
island
domain
where
he
might
have
an
opportunity
to
make
me
comfortable
the
kind
gentleman
little
knew
how
hardened
i
had
become
to
such
annoyances
as
hard
floors
and
the
active
flea
such
inconveniences
had
been
robbed
of
their
discomforts
by
the
kind
voices
of
welcome
which
with
few
exceptions
came
from
every
southern
gentleman
whose
territory
had
been
invaded
by
the
paper
canoe
there
was
but
one
place
of
worship
on
the
island
and
that
was
under
the
charge
of
the
negroes
accepting
the
invitation
of
a
nephew
of
the
resident
new
england
proprietor
of
doboy
island
to
attend

shanty
and
the
preacher
an
old
freedman
was
about
to
read
a
hymn
as
we
entered
at
first
the
singing
was
low
and
monotonous
but
it
gradually
swelled
to
a
high
pitch
as
the
negroes
became
excited
praying
followed
the
singing
then
the
black
preacher
set
aside
de
shouting
part
of
the

he
considered

monday
march
opened
fair
but
the
wind
arose
when
the
canoe
reached
three
mile
cut
which
connects
the
darien
with
altamaha
river
i
went
through
this
narrow
steamboat
passage
and
being
prevented
by
the
wind
from
entering
the
wide
altamaha
returned
to
the
darien
river
and
ascended
it
to
general
cut
which
with
butler
river
affords
a
passage
to
the
altamaha
river
before
entering
general
cut
mistaking
a
large
half
submerged
alligator
for
a
log
on
a
mud
bank
the
canoe
nearly
touched
the
saurian
before
he
was
roused
from
his
nap
to
retire
into
the
water
general
cut
penetrates
a
rice
plantation
opposite
the
town
of
darien
to
butler
island
the
estate
of
the
late
pierce
butler
at
its
southern
end
since
the
war
had
not
proved
a
very
profitable
business
to
the
present
proprietors
who
deserve
much
praise
for
the
efforts
they
have
made
to
educate
their
freedmen
a
profitable
crop
of
oranges
is
gathered
some
seasons
from
the
groves
upon
butler
island
from
the
mouth
of
general
cut
down
butler
river
to
the
altamaha
was
but
a
short
row
the
latter
stream
would
have
taken
me
to
altamaha
sound
to
avoid
which
i
passed
through
wood
cut
into
the
south
altamaha
river
and
proceeded
through
the
lowland
towards
simon
island
which
is
by
the
sea
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
when
close
to
broughton
island
where
the
south
altamaha
presented
a
wide
area
to
the
strong
which
was
sending
little
waves
over
my
canoe
a
white
under
the
veranda
of
which
an
elderly
gentleman
was
sitting
attracted
my
attention
here
was
what
seemed
to
be
the
last
on
a
route
of
several
miles
to
simon
island
if
the
wind
continued
to
blow
from
the
same
quarter
the
canoe
could
not
cross
buttermilk
sound
that
night
so
i
went
ashore
to
inquire
if
there
were
any
hammocks
in
the
marshes
by
the
between
the
plantation
and
the
sound
the
bachelor
proprietor
of
broughton
island
captain
richard
akin
posted
me
as
to
the
route
to
simon
island
but
insisted
that
the
canoe
traveller
should
share
his
comfortable
quarters
until
the
next
day
and
when
the
next
day
came
round
and
the
warm
sun
and
smooth
current
of
the
wide
altamaha
invited
me
to
continue
the
voyage
the
hospitable
thought
the
weather
not
settled
enough
for
me
to
venture
down
to
the
sound
in
fact
he
held
me
a
rather
willing
captive
for
several
days
and
then
let
me
off
on
the
condition
that
i
should
return
at
some
future
time
and
spend
a
month
with
him
in
examining
the
sea
islands
and
game
resources
of
the
vicinity
captain
akin
was
a
successful
on
the
new
system
of
employing
freedmen
on
wages
but
while
he
protected
the
ignorant
blacks
in
all
their
rights
he
was
a
thorough
disciplinarian
the
negroes
seemed
to
like
their
employer
and
stuck
to
him
with
greater
tenacity
than
they
did
to
those
planters
who
allowed
them
to
do
as
they
pleased
the
result
of
lax
treatment
with
these
people
is
always
a
failure
of
crops
the
rivers
and
swamps
near
broughton
island
abound
in
fine
fishes
and
terrapin
while
the
marshes
and
flats
of
the
sea
islands
afford
excellent
opportunities
for
the
sportsman
to
try
his
skill
upon
the
feathered
tribe
on
monday
march
the
maria
theresa
left
broughton
island
well
provisioned
with
the
stores
the
generous
captain
had
pressed
upon
my
acceptance
the
atmosphere
was
softened
by
balmy
breezes
and
the
bright
sunlight
played
with
the
shadows
of
the
clouds
upon
the
wide
marshes
which
were
now
growing
green
with
the
warmth
of
returning
spring
the
fish
sprang
from
the
water
as
i
touched
it
with
my
light
oars
simon
island
where
pierce
butler
once
cultivated
cotton
and
to
which
he
took
his
english
bride
miss
kemble
with
its
almost
abandoned
plantation
was
reached
before
ten
frederica
river
carried
me
along
the
whole
length
of
the
island
to
simon
sound
when
midway
the
island
i
paused
to
survey
what
remains
of
the
old
town
of
frederica
of
which
but
few
vestiges
can
be
discovered
history
informs
us
that
frederica
was
the
first
town
built
by
the
english
in
georgia
and
was
founded
by
general
oglethorpe
who
began
and
established
the
colony
the
fortress
was
regular
and
beautiful
and
was
the
largest
most
regular
and
perhaps
most
costly
of
any
in
north
america
of
british
construction
pursuing
my
journey
southward
the
canoe
entered
the
exposed
area
of
sound
which
with
its
ocean
inlet
was
easily
crossed
to
the
wild
and
picturesque
jekyl
island
upon
which
the
two
bachelor
brothers
dubignon
live
and
hunt
the
deer
enjoying
the
free
life
of
lords
of
the
forest
their
old
family
mansion
once
a
haven
of
hospitality
where
the
northern
tourist
and
shipwrecked
sailor
shared
alike
the
good
things
of
this
life
with
the
kind
host
was
used
for
a
target
by
a
gunboat
during
the
late
war
and
is
now
in
ruins
here
twenty
years
ago
at
midnight
the
wanderer
landed
her
cargo
of
african
negroes
the
capital
for
the
enterprise
being
supplied
by
three
southern
gentlemen
and
the
execution
of
the
work
being
intrusted
under
carefully
drawn
contracts
to
boston
parties
the
calm
weather
greatly
facilitated
my
progress
and
had
i
not
missed
jekyl
creek
which
is
the
steamboat
thoroughfare
through
the
marshes
to
jekyl
and
andrew
sound
that
whole
day
experience
would
have
been
a
most
happy
one
the
mouth
of
jekyl
creek
was
a
narrow
entrance
and
being
off
in
the
sound
i
passed
it
as
i
approached
the
lowlands
which
were
skirted
until
a
passage
at
cedar
hammock
through
the
marsh
was
found
some
distance
from
the
one
i
was
seeking
into
this
i
entered
and
winding
about
for
some
time
over
its
tortuous
course
at
a
late
hour
in
the
afternoon
the
canoe
emerged
into
a
broad
watercourse
down
which
i
could
look
across
jekyl
sound
to
the
sea
this
broad
stream
was
jointer
creek
and
i
ascended
it
to
find
a
spot
of
high
ground
upon
which
to
camp
it
was
now
low
water
and
the
surface
of
the
marshes
was
three
or
four
feet
above
my
head
after
much
anxious
searching
and
a
great
deal
of
rowing
against
the
last
of
the
ebb
a
forest
of
pines
and
was
reached
on
colonel
island
at
a
point
about
four
miles
across
the
marshes
and
brunswick
river
from
the
interesting
old
town
of
brunswick
georgia
home
of
the
alligator
the
soft
muddy
shores
of
the
hammock
were
in
one
place
enveloped
in
a
thicket
of
reeds
and
here
i
rested
upon
my
oars
to
select
a
convenient
the
rustling
of
the
reeds
suddenly
attracted
my
attention
some
animal
was
crawling
through
the
thicket
in
the
direction
of
the
boat
my
eyes
became
fixed
upon
the
mysterious
shaking
and
waving
of
the
tops
of
the
reeds
and
my
hearing
was
strained
to
detect
the
cause
of
the
crackling
of
the
dry
rushes
over
which
this
unseen
creature
was
moving
a
moment
later
my
curiosity
was
satisfied
for
there
emerged
slowly
from
the
covert
an
alligator
nearly
as
large
as
my
canoe
the
brute
head
was
as
long
as
a
barrel
his
rough
coat
of
mail
was
besmeared
with
mud
and
his
dull
eyes
were
fixed
steadily
upon
me
i
was
so
surprised
and
fascinated
by
the
appearance
of
this
huge
reptile
that
i
remained
immovable
in
my
boat
while
he
in
a
deliberate
manner
entered
the
water
within
a
few
feet
of
me
the
hammock
suddenly
lost
all
its
inviting
aspect
and
i
pulled
away
from
it
faster
than
i
had
approached
in
the
gloom
i
observed
two
little
hammocks
between
island
and
the
brunswick
river
which
seemed
to
be
near
jointer
creek
so
i
followed
the
tortuous
thoroughfares
until
i
was
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
one
of
them
pulling
my
canoe
up
a
narrow
creek
towards
the
largest
hammock
until
the
creek
ended
in
the
lowland
i
was
cheered
by
the
sight
of
a
small
house
in
a
grove
of
to
reach
which
i
was
obliged
to
abandon
my
canoe
and
attempt
to
cross
the
soft
marsh
the
tide
was
now
rising
rapidly
and
it
might
be
necessary
for
me
to
swim
some
inland
creek
before
i
could
arrive
at
the
upland
an
oar
was
driven
into
the
soft
mud
of
the
marsh
and
the
canoe
tied
to
it
for
i
knew
that
the
whole
country
with
the
exception
of
the
hammock
near
by
would
be
under
water
at
floundering
through
mud
and
pressing
aside
the
tall
grass
of
the
lowland
which
entangled
my
feet
frequently
leaping
natural
ditches
and
going
down
with
a
thud
in
the
mud
on
the
other
side
i
finally
struck
the
firm
ground
of
the
largest
jointer
hammock
when
the
voice
of
its
owner
williams
sounded
most
cheerfully
in
my
ears
as
he
exclaimed
where
did
you
come
from
how
did
you
get
across
the
marsh
the
unfortunate
position
of
my
boat
was
explained
while
the
family
gathered
round
me
after
which
we
sat
down
to
supper
wilhams
felt
anxious
about
the
cargo
of
my
boat
the
coons
he
said
will
scent
your
provisions
and
tear
everything
to
pieces
in
the
boat
we
must
go
look
after
it
immediately
to
go
to
the
canoe
we
were
obliged
to
follow
a
creek
which
swept
past
the
side
of
the
hammock
opposite
to
my
and
row
two
or
three
miles
on
jointer
creek
at
nine
we
reached
the
locality
where
i
had
abandoned
the
paper
canoe
everything
had
changed
in
appearance
the
land
was
under
water
not
a
landmark
remained
except
the
top
of
the
oar
which
rose
out
of
the
expanse
of
water
while
near
it
gracefully
floated
my
little
companion
we
towed
her
to
the
hammock
and
after
the
tedious
labor
of
divesting
myself
of
the
marsh
mud
which
clung
to
my
clothes
had
been
crowned
with
success
the
comfortable
bed
furnished
by
my
host
gave
rest
to
limbs
and
nerves
which
had
been
severely
overtaxed
since
sun
set
the
following
day
opened
cloudy
and
windy
the
ocean
inlet
of
jekyl
and
andrew
sounds
is
three
miles
wide
from
the
mouth
of
jointer
creek
across
these
unprotected
sounds
to
high
point
of
cumberland
island
is
eight
miles
the
route
from
the
creek
to
cumberland
island
was
a
risky
one
for
so
small
a
boat
as
the
paper
canoe
while
the
weather
continued
unpropitious
after
entering
the
sounds
there
was
but
one
spot
of
upland
near
the
mouth
of
the
satilla
river
that
could
be
used
for
camping
purposes
on
the
vast
area
of
marshes
during
the
month
of
march
rainy
and
windy
weather
prevail
on
this
coast
i
could
ill
afford
to
lose
any
time
shut
up
in
jointer
hammock
by
bad
weather
as
the
low
regions
of
okefenokee
swamp
were
to
be
penetrated
before
the
warm
season
could
make
the
task
a
disagreeable
one
after
holding
a
consultation
with
williams
he
contracted
to
take
the
canoe
and
its
captain
across
andrew
sound
to
high
point
of
cumberland
island
that
day
his
little
sloop
was
soon
under
way
and
though
the
short
breaking
waves
of
the
sound
and
the
furious
blasts
of
wind
made
the
navigation
of
the
shoals
disagreeable
we
landed
quietly
at
oriental
hotel
at
high
point
soon
after
noon
martin
the
surveyor
of
the
island
welcomed
me
to
cumberland
and
gave
me
much
information
pertaining
to
local
matters
the
next
morning
the
canoe
left
the
high
bluffs
of
this
beautiful
sea
island
so
filled
with
historic
associations
and
threaded
the
marshy
thoroughfare
of
cumberland
and
brickhill
river
to
cumberland
sound
as
i
approached
the
mouth
of
the
mary
river
the
picturesque
ruins
of
dungeness
towered
above
the
forest
of
the
southern
end
of
cumberland
island
it
was
with
regret
i
turned
my
back
upon
that
sea
the
sounds
of
which
had
so
long
struck
upon
my
ear
with
their
sweet
melody
it
seemed
almost
a
moan
that
was
borne
to
me
now
as
the
soft
waves
laved
the
sides
of
my
graceful
craft
as
though
to
give
her
a
last
loving
farewell

on

right
hand
and

on
my
left
pretty
hammocks
dotted
the

while
the
country
presented
peculiar

four
miles
from

the
little
city
of

situated
on

side
of
the
river
was
before
me
and
i
went
ashore
to
make
inquiries
concerning
the
route
to
okefenokee
swamp
my
object
was
to
get
information
about
the
upper
mary
river
from
which
i
proposed
to
make
a
portage
of
or
forty
miles
in
a
westerly
direction
to
the
suwanee
river
upon
arriving
at
which
i
would
descend
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
my
efforts
both
at
and
fernandina
on
the
florida
side
of
cumberland
sound
to
obtain
any
reliable
information
upon
this
matter
were
unsuccessful
a
settlement
at
trader
hill
about
miles
up
the
mary
river
was
the
geographical
limit
of
local
knowledge
while
i
wished
to
ascend
the
river
at
least
one
hundred
miles
beyond
that
point
believing
that
if
i
explored
the
uninhabited
sources
of
the
mary
i
should
be
compelled
to
return
without
finding
any
settler
upon
its
banks
at
the
proper
point
of
departure
for
a
portage
to
the
suwanee
it
became
necessary
to
abandon
all
idea
of
ascending
this
river
i
could
not
however
give
up
the
exploration
of
the
route
in
this
dilemma
a
kindly
written
letter
seemed
to
solve
the
difficulties

from

kindly
proposed
that
i
should
take
my

dutton
offered
to
transport
the

could
be
from

point
easily
descended
to

the

at

be

offered
me
the
free
use
of
his
long
railroad
for
any
purpose
of
exploration
while
his
son
wickliffe
yulee
exerted
himself
to
remove
all
impediments
to
delay
these
gentlemen
being
native
floridians
have
done
much
towards
encouraging
all
legitimate
exploration
of
the
peninsula
and
have
also
done
something
towards
putting
a
check
on
the
outrageous
impositions
practised
on
northern
agricultural
emigrants
to
florida
by
encouraging
the
organization
of
a

offers
a

for
fifty

to
be
selected
out
of
nearly
six
hundred
thousand
acres
of

along

a
man
of
comparatively
small
means
can
now
try
the
experiment
of
making
a
home
in
the
mild
climate
of
florida
and
if
he
afterwards
abandons
the
enterprise
there
will
have
been
but
a
small
investment
of
capital
and
consequently
little
loss
the
turpentine
distillery
of
dutton
was
situated
in
a
heavy
forest
of
lofty
pines
major
dutton
furnished
a
team
of
mules
to
haul
the
maria

to

the
morning
after
my
arrival
by
rail
at

the
warm
sunshine
shot
aslant
the
tall
pines
as
the
teamster
followed
a
faintly
developed
trail
towards
the
swamps
before
noon
the
flashing
waters
of
the
stream
were
discernible
and
a
little
later
with
paddle
in
hand
i
was
urging
the
canoe
towards
the
atlantic
coast
a
luxurious
growth
of
trees
and
shrubs
fringed
the
low
and
in
some
places
submerged

shores
back
on
the
higher
sandy
soils
the

when

with

a

ai
met
with
everywhar
from

as
i
glided
swiftly
down
the
dark
current
i
peered
into
the
dense
woods
hoping
to
be
cheered
by
the
sight
of
a
settler
cabin
but
in
all
that
day
search
not
a
clearing
could
be
found
nor
could
i
discern
rising
from
the
treetops
of
the
solitary
forest
a
little
cloud
of
smoke
issuing
from
the
chimney
of
civilized
man
i
was
alone
in
the
vast
wilds
through
which
the
beautiful
river
flowed
noiselessly
but
swiftly
to
the
sea
thoreau
loved
a
swamp
and
so
do
all
lovers
of
nature
for
nowhere
else
does
she
so
bountifully
show
her
vigorous
powers
of
growth
her
varied
wealth
of
botanical
wonders
here
the
birds
resort
in
flocks
when
weary
of
the
hot
sandy
uplands
for
here
they
find
pure
water
cool
shade
and
many
a
curious
glossy
berry
for
their
dainty
appetites
as
the
little
maria
theresa
sped
onward
through
the
open
forest
and
tangled
through
wet
morass
and
piny
upland
my
thoughts
dwelt
upon
the
humble
life
of
the
concord
naturalist
and
philosopher
how
he
would
have
enjoyed
the
descent
of
this
wild
river
from
the
swamp
to
the
sea
he
had
left
us
for
purer
delights
but
i
could
enjoy
his
walden
as
though
he
still
lived
and
read
of
his
studies
of
nature
with
interest
swamps
have
their
peculiar
features
those
of
the
waccamaw
were
indeed
desolate
while
the
swamps
of
the
mary
were
full
of
sunshine
for
the
traveller
soon
after
the
canoe
had
commenced
her
river
journey
a
sharp
sound
like
that
produced
by
a
man
striking
the
water
with
a
broad
flat
stick
reached
my
ears
as
this
sound
was
frequently
repeated
and
always
in
advance
of
my
boat
it
roused
my
curiosity
it
proved
to
come
from
alligators
one
after
another
slipped
off
the
banks
striking
the
water
with
their
tails
as
they
took
refuge
in
the
river
from
the
disturber
of
their
peace
to
observe
the
movements
of
these
reptiles
i
ran
the
canoe
within
two
rods
of
the
left
shore
and
by
rapid
paddling
was
enabled
to
arrive
opposite
a
creature
as
he
entered
the
water
when
thus
confronted
the
alligator
would
depress
his
ugly
head
lash
the
water
once
with
his
tail
and
dive
under
the
canoe
a
most
thoroughly
alarmed
animal
all
these
alligators
were
mere
babies
very
few
being
over
four
feet
long
had
they
been
as
large
as
the
one
which
greeted
me
at
colonel
island
i
should
not
have
investigated
their
dispositions
but
would
have
considered
discretion
the
better
part
of
valor
and
left
them
undisturbed
in
their
on
the
banks
in
all
my
experience
with
the
hundreds
of
alligators
i
have
seen
in
the
southern
rivers
and
swamps
of
north
america
every
one
both
large
and
small
fled
at
the
approach
of
man
the
experience
of
some
of
my
friends
in
their
acquaintance
with
american
alligators
has
been
of
a
more
serious
nature
it
is
well
to
exercise
care
about
camping
at
night
close
to
the
water
infested
with
large
saurians
as
one
of
these
strong
fellows
could
easily
seize
a
sleeping
man
by
the
leg
and
draw
him
into
the
river
they
do
not
seem
to
fear
a
recumbent
or
bowed
figure
but
like
most
wild
animals
flee
before
the
upright
form
of
man
late
in
the
afternoon
i
passed
an
island
made
by
a
through
a
bend
of
the
river
and
according
to
previous
directions
counted
fourteen
bends
or
reaches
in
the
river
which
was
to
guide
me
to
stewart
ferry
the
owner
of
which
lived
back
in
the
woods
his
cabin
not
being
discernible
from
the
river
near
this
spot
which
is
occasionally
visited
by
lumbermen
and
pinywoods
settlers
i
drew
my
canoe
on
to
a
sandy
beach
one
rod
in
length
a
little
bluff
five
or
six
feet
above
the
water
furnished
me
with
the
broad
leaves
of
the
a
dwarfish
sort
of
palm
which
i
arranged
for
a
bed
the
was
placed
at
my
head
a
little
fire
of
cheered
me
for
a
while
but
its
bright
flame
soon
attracted
winged
insects
in
large
numbers
having
made
a
cup
of
chocolate
and
eaten
some
of
captain
akin
chipped
beef
and
crackers
i
continued
my
preparations
for
the
night
feeling
somewhat
nervous
about
large
alligators
i
covered
myself
with
a
piece
of
painted
canvas
which
was
stiff
and
strong
and
placed
the
little
revolver
my
only
weapon
under
my
blanket
as
i
fully
realized
the
novelty
of
my
strange
position
in
this
desolate
region
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
compose
myself
and
sleep
it
was
a
night
of
dreams
sounds
indistinct
but
numerous
troubled
my
brain
until
i
was
fully
roused
to
wakefulness
by
horrible
visions
and
doleful
cries
the
which
in
the
south
supplies
the
place
of
our
whippoorwill
repeated
his
tale
of
with
untiring
earnestness
the
owls
hooted
wildly
with
a
chorus
of
cries
from
animals
and
reptiles
not
recognizable
by
me
excepting
the
snarling
voices
of
the
coons
fighting
in
the
forest
these
last
were
old
acquaintances
however
as
they
frequently
gathered
round
my
camp
at
night
to
pick
up
the
remains
of
supper
while
i
listened
there
rose
a
cry
so
hideous
in
its
character
and
so
belligerent
in
its
tone
that
i
trembled
with
fear
upon
my
mattress
it
resembled
the
bellowing
of
an
infuriated
bull
but
was
louder
and
more
penetrating
in
its
effect
the
proximity
of
this
animal
was
indeed
unpleasant
for
he
had
planted
himself
on
the
river
edge
near
the
little
bluff
upon
which
my
camp
had
been
constructed
the
loud
roar
was
answered
by
a
similar
bellow
from
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
for
a
long
time
did
these
two
male
alligators
keep
up
their
challenging
cries
without
coming
to
combat
numerous
attacked
my
and
even
worked
their
way
through
the
leaves
of
my
palmetto
mattress
thus
with
an
endless
variety
of
annoyances
the
night
wore
wearily
away
but
the
light
of
the
rising
sun
did
not
penetrate
the
thick
fog
which
enveloped
the
river
until
after
eight
when
i
embarked
for
a
second
day
journey
upon
the
stream
which
had
now
attained
a
width
of
five
or
six
rods
rafts
of
logs
blocked
the
river
as
i
approached
the
settlement
of
hill
and
upon
a
most
insecure
footing
the
canoe
was
dragged
over
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
logs
and
put
into
the
water
on
the
lower
side
of
the
jam
crossing
several
of
these
log
jams
which
covered
the
entire
width
of
the
mary
i
became
weary
of
the
task
and
after
the
last
was
reached
determined
to
go
into
camp
until
the
next
day
when
suddenly
the
voices
of
men
in
the
woods
were
heard
soon
a
gentleman
with
two
raftsmen
appeared
and
kindly
greeted
me
they
had
been
notified
of
my
approach
at
trader
hill
by
a
courier
sent
from
dutton
across
the
woods
and
these
men
whose
knowledge
of
is
wonderful
had
timed
my
movements
so
correctly
that
they
had
arrived
just
in
time
to
meet
me
at
this
point
the
two
raftsmen
rubbed
the
canoe
all
over
with
their
hands
and
expressed
delight
at
its
beautiful
finish
in
their
own
peculiar
vernacular
she
the
thing
i
ever
seed
and
jist
as
putty
as
a
new
coffin
exclaimed
one
indeed
she
the
handsomest
trick
i
ever
did
blink
on
said
the
second
the
two
stalwart
lumbermen
lifted
the
boat
as
though
she
were
but
a
feather
and
carried
her
jumping
from
log
to
log
the
whole
length
of
the
raft
they
then
put
her
gently
in
the
water
and
added
to
their
farewell
the
cheering
intelligence
that
there
no
more
jams
nor
rafts
here
and
the
sea
and
you
can
go
clar
on
to
new
york
if
you
like
trader
hill
on
a
very
high
bluff
on
the
left
bank
was
soon
passed
when
the
current
seemed
suddenly
to
cease
and
i
felt
the
first
tidal
effect
of
the
sea
though
many
miles
from
the
coast
the
tide
was
flooding
i
now
laid
aside
the
paddle
and
putting
the
light
steel
outriggers
in
their
sockets
rapidly
rowed
down
the
now
broad
river
until
the
shadows
of
night
fell
upon
forest
and
stream
when
the
comfortable
residence
of
lewis
davis
with
his
steam
came
into
sight
upon
orange
bluff
on
the
florida
side
of
the
river
here
a
kind
welcome
greeted
me
from
host
and
hostess
who
had
dwelt
twenty
years
in
this
romantic
but
secluded
spot
there
were
forty
years
old
on
this
property
and
all
in
fine
bearing
order
there
was
also
a
fine
sulphur
spring
near
the
house
davis
stated
that
during
a
residence
of
twenty
years
in
this
charming

he
had
experienced
but
one
attack
of
chills
he
considered
the
mary
river
on
account
of
the
purity
of
its
waters
one
of
the
healthiest
of
southern
streams
the
descent
of
this
beautiful
river
now
became
a
holiday
pastime
though
there
were
but
few
signs
of
the
existence
of
man
the
scenery
was
of
a
cheering
character
a
a
few
and
an
abandoned
were
passed
while
the
low
saltmarshes
extending
into
the
river
from
the
upland
gave
evidence
of
the
proximity
to
the
sea
large
alligators
were
frequently
seen
sunning
themselves
upon
the
edges
of
the
banks
at
dusk
the
town
of
mary
in
its
wealth
of
foliage
opened
to
my
view
from
across
the
lowlands
and
soon
after
the
paper
canoe
was
carefully
stored
in
a
building
belonging
to
one
of
its
hospitable
citizens
while
local
authority
asserted
that
i
had
traversed
one
hundred
and
miles
of
the
river
one
evening
while
enjoying
the
hospitality
of
silas
fordam
at
his
beautiful
winter
home
orange
hall
situated
in
the
heart
of
mary
a
note
signed
by
the
hon
arnow
mayor
of
the
city
was
handed
me
arnow
in
the
name
of
the
city
government
invited
my
presence
at
the
spencer
house
upon
arriving
at
the
hotel
a
surprise
awaited
me
the
citizens
of
the
place
had
gathered
to
welcome
the
paper
canoe
and
its
owner
and
to
express
the
kindly
feelings
they
as
southern
citizens
held
towards
their
northern
friends
the
hotel
was
decorated
with
flags
and
floral
emblems
one
of
which
expressed
in
its
ingeniously
constructed
words
wrought
in
flowers
one
hundred
thousand
welcomes
the
mayor
and
his
friends
received
me
upon
the
veranda
of
the
hotel
with
kind
words
of
welcome
bright
lights
glimmered
at
this
moment
through
the
long
avenue
of
trees
and
music
arose
upon
the
night
air
it
was
a
torchlight
procession
coming
from
the
river
bearing
upon
a
framework
structure
from
which
hung
chinese
lanterns
and
wreaths
of
laurel
the
little
paper
canoe
the
club
of
the
city
dressed
in
their
handsome
uniform
carried
the
maria
theresa
while
the
sailors
from
the
lumber
fleet
in
the
river
with
the
flags
of
several
nationalities
brought
up
the
rear
when
the
procession
arrived
in
front
of
the
hotel
three
hearty
cheers
were
given
by
the
people
and
the
mayor
read
the
city
address
of
welcome
to
me
to
which
i
made
reply
not
only
in
behalf
of
myself
but
of
all
those
of
my
countrymen
who
desired
the
establishment
of
a
pure
and
good
government
in
every
portion
of
our
dear
land
mayor
arnow
presented
me
with
an
engrossed
copy
of
his
speech
of
welcome
in
which
he
invited
all
industrious
northerners
to
come
to
his
native
city
promising
that
city
ordinances
should
be
passed
to
encourage
the
erection
of
manufactories
by
northern
capital
and
northern
labor
after
the
address
the
wife
of
the
mayor
presented
me
with
two
memorial
banners
in
the
name
of
the
ladies
of
the
city
these
were
made
for
the
occasion
and
being
the
handiwork
of
the
ladies
themselves
were
highly
appreciated
by
the
recipient
when
these
graceful
tributes
had
been
received
each
lady
and
child
present
deposited
a
bouquet
of
flowers
grown
in
the
gardens
of
mary
in
my
little
craft
till
it
contained
about
four
hundred
of
these
refined
expressions
of
the
of
these
kind
people
not
only
did
the
native
population
of
the
town
vie
with
each
other
to
accord
the
lonely
voyager
a
true
southern
welcome
but
curtis
an
english
gentleman
who
becoming
fascinated
with
the
fine
climate
of
this
part
of
georgia
had
settled
here
did
all
he
could
to
show
his
appreciation
of
and
superintended
the
marine
display
and
flag
corps
of
the
procession
i
left
mary
with
a
strange
longing
to
return
to
its
interesting
environs
and
to
study
here
the
climatology
of
southern
georgia
for
strange
to
say
cases
of
local
fever
and
chills
have
never
originated
in
the
city
it
is
reached

joseph

most
faithful

officer
has
filled
the
position
of

its

prophesy
a

for

when
a
river
and
canal
route
across
the

between
the
atlantic
ocean
and
the

shall
have
been
completed
for
many
years
colonel
raiford
has
been
elaborating
his
plan
for
elongating
the
western
and
southern
inland
system
of
navigation
to
harbors
of
the
atlantic
ocean
he
proposes
to
unite
the
natural
watercourses
of
the
coast
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
by
short
canals
so
that
barges
drawing
seven
feet
of
water
and
freighted
with
the
produce
of
the
mississippi
river
and
its
tributaries
may
pass
from
new
orleans
eastward
to
the
southern
ports
of
the
atlantic
states
the
great
peninsula
of
florida
would
be
crossed
by
these
vessels
from
the
suwanee
to
the
mary
river
by
means
of
a
canal
cut
through
the
okefenokee
swamp
and
this
route
would
save
several
hundred
miles
of
navigation
upon
open
ocean
waters
the
dangerous
coral
reefs
of
the
florida
and
bahama
shores
would
be
avoided
and
a
channel
of
thirty
thousand
miles
of
navigable
watercourses
would
be
united
in
one
system
q
gilmore
report
on
water
line
for
transportation
from
the
mouth
of
the
mary
river
on
the
atlantic
coast
through
okefenokee
swamp
and
the
state
of
florida
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
in
which
the
able
inquirer
discusses
this
water
route
has
recently
been
published
i
traversed
a
portion
of
this
route
in
from
the
head
of
the
ohio
river
to
new
orleans
and
along
the
shores
of
the
gulf
of

to
cedar
keys
in
a
cedar
and
as
the
results
of
my
observations
may
some
day
be
made
public
i
will
at
this
time
refer
the
reader
if
he
be
interested
in
the
important
enterprise
to
the
congressional
reports
which
describe
the
feasibility
of
the
plan
another
portage
by
rail
was
made
in
order
to
complete
my
journey
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
rixford
near
the
suwanee
river
was
reached
via
the
railroad
to
baldwin
thence
over
the
railroad
to
live
oak
where
another
railroad
from
the
north
connects
and
along
which
a
few
miles
from
live
oak
dutton
rixford
had
recently
established
their
turpentine
and
resin
works
at
rixford
i
found
myself
near
the
summit
or
backbone
of
florida
from
which
the
tributaries
of
the
flow
on
one
side
to
the
atlantic
ocean
and
on
the
other
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
it
was
a
high
region
of
rolling
country
heavily
wooded
with
magnificent
pine
forests
rich
in
terebinthine
resources
the
residence
of
the
proprietor
the
store
and
the
distillery
with
a
few
log
cabins
inhabited
by
negroes
and
white
employees
made
up
the
establishment
of
rixford
the
crackers
and
negroes
came
from
long
distances
to
see
the
paper
boat
one
afternoon
when
a
number
of
people
had
gathered
at
rixford
to
behold
the
little
craft
i
placed
it
on
one
of
those
curious
sheets
of
water
of
crystal
purity
called
in
that
region
a
sink
and
though
this
nameless
lakelet
did
not
cover
over
an
acre
in
extent
the
movements
of
the
little
craft
when
propelled
by
the
double
paddle
excited
an
enthusiasm
which
is
seldom
exhibited
by
the
people
as
the
boat
was
carefully
lifted
from
the
silvery
tarn
one
woman
called
out
in
a
loud
voice
lake
theresa
and
thus
by
mutual
consent
of
every
one
present
did
this
lakelet
of
crystal
waters
receive
its
name
the
blacks
crowded
around
the
canoe
and
while
feeling
its
firm
texture
and
wondering
at
the
long
distance
it
had
traversed
expressed
themselves
in
their
peculiar
and
original
way
one
of
their
number
known
as
a
tonguey
nigger
volunteered
to
explain
the
wonder
to
the
somewhat
confused
intellects
of
his
companions
to
a
question
from
one
negro
as
to
how
did
dis
yere
cum
all
dis
fur

in

all

the

responded
all
the
negroes
then
with
a
look
of
supreme
contempt
for
the
ignorance
of
his
audience
the
orator
proceeded

great

de

not
franklin
dat

all
dis
it
was
amusing
to
watch
the
varied
expression
of
the
negroes
as
they
listened
to
this
description
of
the
discovery
of
electricity
and
the
origin
of
the
telegraph
their
eyes
dilated
with
wonder
and
their
thick
lips
parted
till
the
mouth
growing
wider
and
wider
seemed
to
cover
more
than
its
share
of
the
face
the
momentary
silence
was
soon
broken
by
a
deep
gurgle
proceeding
from
a
negro
as
he
exclaimed
did
he
kotch
de
bottle
full
ob

and
cork
him
up
golly
i
tort
he

he
wud
so
he
wud
roared
the
orator
but
ye
see
was
all
de
lord
de
it
while
in
florida
i
paid
some
attention
to
the
negro
method
of
conducting
praise
meetings
which
they
very
appropriately
call
de
shoutings
if
i
give
some
verbatim
reports
of
the
negro
curious
and
undignified
clerical
efforts
it
is
not
done
for
the
purpose
of
caricaturing
him
nor
with
a
desire
to
make
him
appear
destitute
of
mental
calibre
but
rather
with
the
hope
that
the
picture
given
may
draw
some
sympathy
from
the
liberal
churches
of
the
north
which
do
not
forget
the
african
in
his
native
jungle
nor
the
barbarous
islanders
of
the
south
seas
a
roman
catholic
priest
told
me
that
he
had
been
disappointed
with
the
progress
his
powerfully
organized
church
had
made
in
converting
the
freedmen
before
going
among
them
i
had
supposed
that
the
black
now
no
longer
a
slave
would
be
easily
attracted
to
the
impressive
ceremonies
of
the
church
of
rome
but
after
witnessing
the
activity
of
their
devotions
and
observing
how
anxious
they
are
to
take
a
conspicuous
and
a
leading
part
in
all
religious
services
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
free
black
of
the
south
would
take
more
naturally
to
methodism
than
to
any
other
form
of
christianity
the
appointment
of
local
preachers
would
be
especially
acceptable
to
the
negro
as
he
would
then
be
permitted
to
have
ministers
of
his
own
color
and
of
his
own
neighborhood
to
lead
the
meetings
while
the
roman
catholic
priest
would
probably
treat
him
more
like
a
child
and
would
therefore
exercise
a
strong
discipline
over
him
in
one
of
their
places
of
worship
at
my
request
a
new
york
lady
well
skilled
in
rapid
writing
and
familiar
with
the
negro
vernacular
reported
verbatim
the
negro
preacher
sermon
the
text
was
the
parable
of
the
ten
virgins

while

where
the

had
made

to
improve
their
condition
i
made
a
few
notes
relating
to
the
freedman
debating
society
of
the
place
affecting
words
they
called
their
organization
de
lycenum
and
its
doings
were
directed
by
a
committee
of

persons
called
respectively
de

and
de
lachrymal
visitor
what
particular
duties
devolved
upon
the
lachrymal
visitor
i
could
never
clearly
ascertain
one
evening
these

debated
upon
the
following
theme
which
is
de

when
ye
are
out
ob

or
when

which
was
another
form
of
expressing
the
old
question
is
there
more
pleasure
in
possession
than
in
anticipation
another
night
the
colored
orators
became
intensely
excited
over
the
query
which
is
de
best
spring
water
or
matches
the
freedmen
for
so
unfortunate
a
class
seem
to
be
remarkably
well
behaved
during
several
journeys
through
the
southern
states
i
found
them
usually
temperate
and
very
civil
in
their
intercourse
with
the
whites
though
it
must
be
confessed
that
but
few
of
them
can
apply
themselves
steadily
and
persistently
to
manual
labor

for
themselves

de
voyage
were
to
meet
me
and
egrets
in
small
flocks
inhabited
the
forest
the
limestone
banks
of
the
river
were
not
visible
as
the
water
was
eighteen
feet
above
its
low
summer
level
i
now
passed
under
the
railroad
bridge
which
connects
live
oak
with
savannah
after
a
steady
row
of
some
hours
my
progress
was
checked
by
a
great
boom
stretched
across
the
river
to
catch
the
logs
which
floated
down
from
the
upper
country
i
was
obliged
to
disembark
and
haul
the
canoe
around
this
obstacle
when
after
passing
a
few
clearings
the
long
bridge
of
the
railroad
came
into
view
stretching
across
the
now
wide
river
from
one
wilderness
to
the
other
on
the
left
bank
was
all
that
remained
of
the
once
flourishing
town
of
columbus
consisting
now
of
a
store
kept
by
allen
and
a
few
buildings
before
the
railroad
was
built
columbus
possessed
a
population
of
five
hundred
souls
and
it
was
reached
during
favorable
stages
of
water
by
steamboats
from
cedar
keys
on
the
gulf
of
mexico
the
building
of
railroads
in
the
south
has
diverted
trade
from
one
locality
to
another
and
many
towns
once
prosperous
have
gone
to
decay
the
steam
and
village
of
ellaville
were
located
on
the
opposite
columbus
and
this
lumber
establishment
is
the
only
place
of
importance
between
it
and
cedar
keys
this
river
to
which
the
heart
of
the
minstrel
darky
is
turning
eber
is
in
fact
almost
without
the
one
little
hut
among
de
bushes
for
it
is
a
wild
and
lonely
stream
even
in
the
most
prosperous
times
there
were
but
few
plantations
upon
its
shores
wild
animals
roam
its
great
forests
and
vile
reptiles
infest
the
dense
swamps
it
is
a
country
well
fitted
for
the
hunter
and
lumberman
for
the
naturalist
or
canoeist
but
the
majority
of
people
would
i
am
sure
rather
hear
of
it
poured
forth
in
song
from
the
sweet
lips
of
christina
nilsson
than
to
be
themselves
way
down
upon
the
suwanee
ribber
on
monday
march
nason
purviance
and
henderson
joined
me
the
party
had
obtained
a
which
had
been
brought
by
rail
from
savannah
it
was
and
was
decked
forward
so
that
the
enthusiastic
tourists
possessed
a
weatherproof
covering
for
their
provisions
and
blankets
with
the
strong
current
of
the
river
a
pair
of
long
oars
and
a
sail
to
be
used
when
favorable
winds
blew
the
party
in
the
could
make
easy
and
rapid
progress
towards
the
gulf
while
my
lightly
dancing
craft
needed
scarcely
a
touch
of
the
oar
to
send
her
forward
on
tuesday
the
we
left
columbus
while
a
crowd
of
people
assembled
to
see
us
off
many
of
them
seeming
to
consider
this
simple
and
delightful
way
of
travelling
too
dangerous
to
be
attempted
the
smooth
but
swift
current
rolled
on
its
course
like
a
sea
of
molten
glass
as
the
soft
sunlight
trembled
through
the
foliage
and
shimmered
over
its
broad
surface
our
boats
glided
safely
over
the
rapids
which
for
a
mile
and
a
half
impede
the
navigation
of
the
river
during
the
summer
months
but
which
were
now
made
safe
by
the
great
depth
of
water
caused
by
the
freshet
the
weather
was
charming
and
our
little
party
fully
alive
to
all
the
beautiful
surroundings
woke
many
an
echo
with
sounds
meant
to
be
sweet
of
course
the
good
old
song
was
not
forgotten
our
best
voice
sang
way
down
de
suwanee

of
each
verse

sad
and
dreary
i
roam
o

how
my
heart
grows
weary
far
from

old
folks
at

we
soon
entered
forests
primeval
which
were
quiet
save
for
the
sound
of
the
axe
of
the
for
is
a
profession
which
reaches
its
greatest
perfection
on
the
florida
state
lands
and
united
states
naval
reserves
uncle
sam
territory
is
being
constantly
plundered
to
supply
the
steam
of
private
individuals
in
florida
several
of
the
party
told
interesting
stories
of
the
way
in
which
managed
to
steal
from
the
government
legally
there
said
one
is
x
who
runs
his
mill
on
the
largest
tract
of
pine
timber
uncle
sam
has
got
he
once
bought
a
few
acres
claim
adjacent
to
a
fine
naval
reserve
he
was
not
of
course
able
to
discover
the
boundary
line
which
separated
his
little
tract
from
the
rich
government
reserve
so
he
kept
a
large
force
of
men
cutting
down
uncle
sam
immense
pines
and
hauling
them
to
the
suwanee
floated
them
to
his
mill
this
thing
went
on
for
some
time
till
the
government
agent
made
his
appearance
and
demanded
a
settlement
the
wholesale
now
showed
a
fair
face
and
very
frankly
explained
that
he
supposed
he
had
been
cutting
logs
from
his
own
territory
but
quite
recently
he
had
discovered
that
he
had
really
been
trespassing
on
the
property
of
his
country
and
as
he
was
truly
a
loyal
citizen
he
desired
to
make
restitution
and
was
now
ready
to
settle
the
government
agent
was
astonished
at
the
seeming
candor
of
the
man
who
so
worked
upon
his
sympathy
that
he
promised
to
be
as
easy
upon
him
as
the
law
allowed
the
agent
settled
upon
a
valuation
of
fifty
cents
an
acre
for
all
the
territory
that
had
been
cut
over
now
said
he
many
acres
of
land
have
you
logged
since
you
put
your
lumbermen
into
the
forest
x
declared
himself
unable
to
answer
this
question
but
generously
offered
to
permit
the
agent
to
put
down
any
number
of
acres
he
thought
would
represent
a
fair
thing
between
a
kind
government
and
one
of
its
unfortunate
citizens
intending
to
do
his
duty
faithfully
the
officer
settled
upon
two
thousand
acres
as
having
been
trespassed
upon
but
to
his
astonishment
the
incomprehensible
offender
stoutly
affirmed
that
he
had
logged
fully
five
thousand
acres
and
at
once
settled
the
matter
in
full
by
paying
hundred
dollars
taking
a
receipt
for
the
same
when
this
enterprising
visited
jacksonville
his
friends
rallied
him
upon
confessing
judgment
to
government
for
three
thousand
acres
of
timber
more
than
had
been
claimed
by
the
agent
this
true
patriot
winked
as
he
replied
is
true
i
hold
a
receipt
from
the
government
for
the
timber
on
five
thousand
acres
at
the
very
low
rate
of
fifty
cents
an
acre
as
i
have
not
yet
cut
logs
from
more
than
of
the
tract
i
intend
to
work
off
the
timber
on
the
other
four
thousand
acres
at
my
leisure
and
no
power
can
stop
me
now
i
have
the
government
receipt
to
show
it
paid
for
the
sloop
and
the
canoe
had
left
columbus
a
little
before
noon
and
at
six
we
passed
charles
ferry
where
the
old
augustine
and
tallahassee
forest
road
crosses
the
river
at
this
lonely
place
an
old
man
now
dead
owned
a
subterranean
spring
which
he
called
mediterranean
passage
this
spring
is
powerful
enough
to
run
a
rickety
the
great
height
of
the
water
allowed
me
to
paddle
into
the
mill
with
my
canoe
at
half
past
seven
a
deserted
log
cabin
at
barrington
ferry
offered
us
shelter
for
the
night
the
whole
of
the
next
day
we
rowed
through
the
same
immense
forests
finding
no
more
cultivated
land
than
during
our
first
voyage
we
landed
at
a
log
cabin
in
a
small
clearing
to
purchase
eggs
of
a
poor
woman
whose
husband
had
shot
her
brother
a
few
days
before
as
the
wife
brother
had
visited
the
cabin
with
the
intention
of
killing
the
husband
the
woman
seemed
to
think
the
murdered
man
had
got
his
desarts
and
as
a
coroner
jury
had
returned
a
verdict
of
justifiable
homicide
the
affair
was
considered
settled
below
this
cabin
we
came
to
island
no
where
rapids
trouble
boatmen
in
the
summer
months
now
we
glided
gently
but
swiftly
over
the
deep
current
the
few
inhabitants
we
met
along
the
banks
of
the
suwanee
seemed
to
carry
with
them
an
air
of
repose
while
awake
to
rouse
them
from
slumbers
we
would
call
loudly
as
we
passed
a
cabin
in
the
woods
and
after
considerable
delay
a
man
would
appear
at
the
door
rubbing
his
eyes
as
though
the
genial
sunlight
was
oppressive
to
his
vision
it
was
indeed
a
quiet
restful
region
this
great
wilderness
of
the
suwanee
we
passed
goodman
farm
and
log
buildings
on
the
left
bank
just
below
island
no
before
noon
and
about
this
time
major
purviance
shot
at
a
large
wild
turkey
meleagris
gallopavo
knocking
it
off
a
bank
into
the
water
the
gobbler
got
back
to
land
and
led
us
a
fruitless
chase
into
the
thicket
of
he
knew
his
ground
better
than
we
for
though
wounded
he
made
good
his
escape
we
stopped
a
few
moments
at
troy
which
though
dignified
in
name
consists
only
of
a
store
and
some
half
dozen
buildings
a
few
miles
below
this
place
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
is
an
uninhabited
elevation
called
rolins
bluff
from
which
a
line
running
north
east
miles
and
a
half
in
length
will
strike

charter
to
connect
live
oak
with

means
of
a
railroad
had
just
passed
the
florida
legislature
but
had
been
killed
by
the
veto
of
the
governor
after
sunset
the
boats
were
secured
in
safe
positions
in
front
of
a
deserted
cabin
round
which
a
luxuriant
growth
of
trees
showed
what
nature
could
do
for
this
neglected
grove
the
night
air
was
balmy
and
tremulous
with
insect
life
while
the
alligators
in
the
swamps
kept
up
their
bellowings
till
morning
after
breakfast
we
descended
to
the
mouth
of
the
santa
fe
river
which
was
on
the
left
bank
of
the
suwanee
the
people
called
it
the
santaffy
the
wilderness
below
the
santa
fe
is
rich
in
associations
of
the
seminole
indian
war
many
relics
have
been
found
and
among
others
on
the
site
of
an
old
indian
town
entombed
in
a
hollow
tree
the
skeletons
of
an
indian
adult
and
child
decked
with
beads
were
discovered

on

and
old
town
hammock
on
the
right
bank
of
the
suwanee
during
the
seminole
war
the
hammock
and
the
neighboring
fastnesses
became
the
of
the
persecuted
indians
and
so
wild
and
undisturbed
is
this
region
even
at
this
time
that
the
bear
lynx
and
panther
take
refuge
from
man
in
its
jungles
colonel
cottrell
left
his
native
virginia
in
and
commenced
the
cultivation
of
the
virgin
soil
of
old
town
hammock
each
state
has
its
peculiar
mode
of
dividing
its
land
and
here
in
florida
this
old
plantation
was
in
township
section
range
the
estate
included
about
two
thousand
acres
of
land
of
which
nearly
eleven
hundred
were
under
cultivation
the
slaves
whom
the
colonel
brought
from
virginia
were
now
his
tenants
and
he
leased
them
portions
of
his
arable
acres
he
considered
this
locality
as
healthy
as
any
in
the
suwanee
country
the
old
planter
home
with
its
hospitable
doors
ever
open
to
the
stranger
was
embowered
in
and
other
trees
from
the
branches
of
which
the
graceful
festoons
of
spanish
moss
waved
in
the
soft
air
telling
of
a
warm
moist
atmosphere
a
large
screw
and
with
and
other
plantation
buildings
were
conveniently
grouped
under
the
spreading
branches
of
the
protecting
oaks
the
estate
produced
cotton
corn
sweet
potatoes
cattle
hogs
and
poultry
deer
sometimes
approached
the
enclosed
fields
while
the
early
morning
call
of
the
wild
turkey
came
from
the
thickets
of
the
hammock
in
this
retired
part
of
florida
cheered
by
the
society
of
a
devoted
wife
and
four
lovely
daughters
lived
the
gentleman
who
not
only
pressed
on
us
the
comforts
of
his
house
but
also
insisted
upon
accompanying
the
paper
canoe
from
his
forest
home
to
the
sea
when
gathered
around
the
firesides
of
the
backwoods
people
the
conversation
generally
runs
into
hunting
stories
indian
reminiscences
and
wild
tales
of
what
the
pioneers
suffered
while
establishing
themselves
in
their
forest
homes
one
event
of
startling
interest
had
occurred
in
the
suwanee
country
a
few
weeks
before
the
paper
canoe
entered
its
confines
two
hunters
went
by
night
to
the
woods
to
shoot
deer
by
firelight
as
they
stalked
about
with
torches
held
above
their
heads
they
came
upon
a
herd
of
deer
which
being
bewildered
by
the
glare
of
the
lights
made
no
attempt
to
escape
sticking
their
torches
in
the
ground
the
hunters
stretched
themselves
flat
upon
the
grass
to
hide
their
forms
from
the
animals
they
hoped
to
kill
at
their
leisure
one
of
the
men
was
stationed
beneath
the
branches
of
a
large
tree
the
other
was
a
few
yards
distant
the
panther
leap
before
the
preconcerted
signal
for
discharging
their
rifles
could
be
given
the
sound
of
a
heavy
body
falling
to
the
ground
and
an
accompanying
smothered
shriek
startled
the
hunter
who
was
farthest
from
the
tree
starting
up
in
alarm
he
flew
to
the
assistance
of
his
friend
whose
prostrate
form
was
covered
by
a
large
panther
which
had
pounced
upon
him
from
the
overhanging
limb
of
the
great
oak
it
had
been
but
the
work
of
an
instant
for
the
powerful
cougar
to
break
with
his
strong
jaws
the
neck
of
the
poor
backwoodsman
in
this
rare
case
of
a
panther
felis
concolor
voluntarily
attacking
man
it
will
be
noted
by
the
student
of
natural
history
that
the
victim
was
lying
upon
the
ground
probably
the
animal
would
not
have
left
his
perch
among
the
branches
of
the
oak
where
he
was
evidently
waiting
for
the
approach
of
the
deer
if
the
upright
form
of
the
man
had
been
seen
go
to
a
southern
bayou
which
is
rarely
if
ever
visited
by
man
and
where
its
saurian
inhabitants
have
never
been
annoyed
by
him
place
your
body
in
a
recumbent
position
on
the
margin
of
the
lagoon
and
wait
until
some
large
alligator
slowly
rises
to
the
surface
of
the
water
he
will
eye
you
for
a
moment
with
evident
curiosity
and
will
in
some
cases
steadily
approach
you
when
the
monster
reptile
is
within
two
or
three
rods
of
your
position
rise
slowly
upon
your
feet
to
your
full
height
and
the
alligator
of
the
southern
states
the
mississippiensis
will
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
retire
with
precipitation
there
are
but
few
wild
animals
that
will
attack
man
willingly
when
face
to
face
with
him
they
quail
before
his
erect
form
in
every
case
of
the
animals
of
north
america
showing
fight
to
man
which
has
been
investigated
by
me
the
beasts
have
had
no
opportunity
to
escape
or
have
had
their
young
to
defend
or
have
been
wounded
by
the
hunter
it
was
nearly
ten
on
friday
march
when
our
merry
party
left
old
town
hammock
this
day
was
to
see
the
end
of
the
voyage
of
the
paper
canoe
for
my
tiny
craft
was
to
arrive
at
the
waters
of
the
great
southern
sea
before
midnight
the
wife
and
daughters
of
our
host
like
true
women
of
the
forest
offered
no
forebodings
at
the
departure
of
the
head
of
their
household
but
wished
him
with
cheerful
looks
a
pleasant
voyage
to
the
gulf
the
gulf
port
of
cedar
keys
is
but
a
few
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
suwanee
river
the
railroad
which
terminates
at
cedar

with
its
connection

other
routes
carry
the
members
of
our
party
to
their
several
homes
the
bright
day
animated
our
spirits
as
we
swept
swiftly
down
the
river
the
party
in
the
now
called
adventurer
rowed
merrily
on
with
song
and
laughter
while
i
made
an
attempt
to
examine
more
closely
the
character
of
the
the
trigono
cephaluspiscivorus
of
lacepede
which
i
had
more
cause
to
fear
than
the
alligators
of
the
river
the
is
about
two
feet
in
length
and
has
a
circumference
of
five
or
six
inches
the
tail
possesses
a
horny
point
about
half
an
inch
in
length
which
is
harmless
though
the
crackers
and
negroes
stoutly
affirm
that
when
it
strikes
a
tree
the
tree
withers
and
dies
and
when
it
enters
the
flesh
of
a
man
he
is
poisoned
unto
death
the
color
of
the
reptile
is
a
dirty
brown
never
found
far
from
water
it
is
common
in
the
swamps
and
is
the
terror
of
the
negroes
the
bite
of
the
is
exceedingly
venomous
and
it
is
considered
more
poisonous
than
that
of
the
rattlesnake
which
warns
man
of
his
approach
by
sounding
his
rattle
the
moccasin
does
not
like
the
rattlesnake
wait
to
be
attacked
but
assumes
the
offensive
whenever
opportunity
offers
striking
with
its
fangs
at
every
animated
object
in
its
vicinity
all
other
species
of
snakes
flee
from
its
presence
it
is
found
as
far
north
as
the
peedee
river
of
south
carolina
and
is
abundant
in
all
low
districts
of
the
southern
states
as
the
suwanee
had
overflowed
its
banks
below
old
town
hammock
the
snakes
had
taken
to
the
low
limbs
of
the
trees
and
to
the
tops
of
bushes
where
they
seemed
to
be
sleeping
in
the
warmth
of
the
bright
sunlight
but
as
i
glided
along
the
shore
a
few
feet
from
their
aerial
beds
they
discovered
my
presence
and
dropped
sluggishly
into
the
water
it
would
not
be
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
we
passed
thousands
of
these
dangerous
reptiles
while
descending
the
suwanee
raftsmen
told
me
that
when
traversing
lagoons
in
their
log
canoes
if
a
moccasin
is
met
some
distance
from
land
he
will
frequently
enter
the
canoe
for
refuge
or
for
rest
and
instances
have
been
known
where
the
occupant
has
been
so
alarmed
as
to
jump
overboard
and
swim
ashore
in
order
to
escape
from
this
malignant
reptile
the
only
place
worthy
of
notice
between
old
town
hammock
and
the
gulf
marshes
is
clay
landing
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
where
tresper
formerly
lived
in
a
very
comfortable
house
clay
landing
was
used
during
the
confederate
war
as
a
place
of
deposit
for
blockade
goods
archer
a
railroad
station
is
but
twenty
miles
distant
and
to
it
over
rough
roads
the
contraband
imports
were
hauled
by
mule
teams
after
having
been
landed
from
the
fleet
as
the
sun
was
sinking
to
rest
and
the
tree
shadows
grew
long
on
the
wide
river
bosom
we
tasted
the
saltness
in
the
air
as
the
briny
breezes
were
wafted
to
us
over
the
forests
from
the
gulf
of
mexico
after
darkness
had
cast
its
sombre
mantle
upon
us
we
left
the
east
pass
entrance
to
the
left
and
our
boats
hurried
on
the
rapidly
ebbing
tide
down
the
broad
west
pass
into
the
great
marshes
of
the
coast
an
hour
later
we
emerged
from
the
dark
forest
into
the
smooth
savannas
the
freshness
of
the
was
exhilarating
the
stars
were
shining
softly
and
the
ripple
of
the
tide
the
call
of
the
heron
or
the
whirr
of
the
frightened
duck
and
the
leaping
of
fishes
from
the
water
were
the
only
sounds
nature
offered
us
it
was
like
entering
another
world
in
these
lowlands
near
the
mouth
of
the
river
there
seemed
to
be
but
one
place
above
the
level
it
was
a
little
hammock
covered
by
a
few
trees
called
bradford
island
and
rose
like
an
oasis
in
the
desert
the
swift
tide
hurried
along
its
shores
and
a
little
farther
on
mingled
the
waters
of
the
great
wilderness
with
that
of
the
sea
our
tired
party
landed
on
a
shelly
beach
and
burned
a
grassy
area
to
destroy
this
done
some
built
a
large
while
others
spread
blankets
upon
the
ground
i
drew
the
faithful
sharer
of
my
long
voyage
near
a
thicket
of
and
slept
beside
it
for
the
last
time
never
thinking
or
dreaming
that
one
year
later
i
should
approach
the
mouth
of
the
suwanee
from
the
west
after
a
long
voyage
of
hundred
miles
from
the
bead
of
the
ohio
river
and
would
again
seek
shelter
on
its
banks
it
was
a
night
of
sweet
repose
the
dissipated
the
damps
and
the
long
row
made
rest
welcome
a
glorious
morning
broke
upon
our
party
as
we
breakfasted
under
the
shady
palms
of
the
island
behind
us
rose
the
compact
wall
of
dark
green
of
the
heavy
forests
and
along
the
coast
from
east
to
west
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
were
the
lowlands
against
which
beat
in
soft
murmurs
the
waves
of
that
sea
i
had
so
longed
to
reach
from
out
the
broad
marshes
arose
low
hammocks
green
with
pines
and
feathery
with
clouds
of
mist
were
rising
and
while
i
watched
them
melt
away
in
the
warm
beams
of
the
morning
sun
i
thought
they
were
like
the
dark
doubts
which
curled
themselves
about
me
so
long
ago
in
the
cold
lawrence
now
all
melted
by
the
joy
of
success
the
snowclad
north
was
now
behind
me
the
maria
theresa
danced
in
the
shimmering
waters
of
the
great
southern

my
heart
was
light

nathaniel
bishop
a
mere
lad
of
seventeen
who
prompted
by
a
love
of
nature
starts
off
from
his
new
england
home
reaches
the
la
plata
river
and
coolly
walks
to
valparaiso
across
pampa
and
cordillera
a
distance
of
more
than
a
thousand
miles
it
is
not
the
mere
fact
of
pedestrianism
that
will
gain
for
master
nathaniel
bishop
a
high
place
among
travellers
nor
yet
the
fact
of
its
having
been
done
in
the
face
of
dangers
and
difficulties
but
that
throughout
the
walk
he
has
gone
with
his
eyes
open
and
gives
us
a
book
written
at
seventeen
that
will
make
him
renowned
at
seventy
it
is
teeming
with
information
both
on
social
and
natural
subjects
end
will
take
rank
among
books
of
scientific
travel
the
only
ones
worth
inquiring
for
one
chapter
from
the
book
of
an
educated
traveller
we
do
mean
the
education
of
oxford
and
cambridge
is
worth
volumes
of
the
stuff
usually
forming
the
staple
of
books
of
travels
and
in
this
unpretending
book
of
the
yankee
boy
for
its
preface
is
signally
of
this
sort
we
have
scores
of
such
chapters
the
title
is
not
altogether
appropriate
it
is
called
thousand
miles
walk
across
south
america
it
is
more
than
a
mere
walk
it
is
an
exploration
into
the
kingdom
of
nature
sir
francis
head
has
gone
over
the
same
ground
on
horseback
end
given
us
a
good
account
of
it
but
this
quiet
of
the
american
boy
is
worth
infinitely
more
than
the
rides
of
the
british
baronet
the
one
is
common
talk
and
superficial
observation
the
other
is
a
study
that
extends
beneath
the
surface
captain
mayne
reid
regarded
simply
as
a
piece
of
adventure
this
were
interesting
especially
when
told
of
in
a
tone
of
delightful
modesty
but
the
book
has
other
recommendations
this
boy
has
an
admirable
eye
for
manners
customs
costumes
to
say
nothing
of
his
attention
to
natural
history
the
reader
seems
to
travel
by
his
side
and
concludes
the
book
with
a
sense
of
having
himself
trodden
the
pampas
and
mingled
with
their
barbarous
inhabitants
so
far
as
writing
goes
this
is
the
supreme
merit
of
a
book
of
travels
let
those
explore
who
not
only
see
for
themselves
but
have
the
rare
ability
to
lend
their
eyes
to
others
bishop
is
one
of
the
few
who
can
do
this
the
graphic
simplicity
of
his
narrative
is
above
praise
meanwhile
his
personal
impression
is
very
charming
the
quiet
patience
with
which
he
accepted
all
the
hardships
of
his
position
without
the
slightest
parade
of
patience
however
is
beyond
measure
attractive
but
the
brave
youth
goes
on
quietly
enduring
what
was
to
be
borne
and
not
ever
allowing
his
observation
to
be
dulled
by
the
infelicities
of
his
situation
