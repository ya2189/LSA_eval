introduction
eha
edward
hamilton
aitken
the
author
of
the
following
sketches
was
well
known
to
the
present
generation
of
by
his
of
eha
as
an
accurate
and
amusing
writer
on
natural
history
subjects
those
who
were
privileged
to
know
him
intimately
as
the
writer
of
this
sketch
did
knew
him
as
a
christian
gentleman
of
singular
simplicity
and
modesty
and
great
charm
of
manner
he
was
always
ready
to
help
a
in
science
or
philanthropy
if
it
were
possible
for
him
to
do
so
thus
indeed
began
the
friendship
between
us
for
when
plague
first
invaded
india
in
the
writer
was
one
of
those
sent
to
bombay
to
work
at
the
problem
of
its
causation
from
the
scientific
side
thereby
becoming
interested
in
the
life
history
of
rats
which
were
shown
to
be
intimately
connected
with
the
spread
of
this
dire
disease
having
for
years
admired
eha
books
on
natural
history
tribes
on
my
frontier
an
indian
naturalist
foreign
and
naturalist
on
the
i
ventured
to
write
to
him
on
the
subject
of
rats
and
their
habits
and
asked
him
whether
he
could
not
throw
some
light
on
the
problem
of
plague
and
its
spread
from
the
point
of
view
in
response
to
this
appeal
he
wrote
a
most
informing
and
characteristic
article
for
times
of
july
which
threw
a
flood
of
light
on
the
subject
of
the
habits
and
characteristics
of
the
indian
rat
as
found
in
town
and
country
he
was
the
first
to
show
that
the
old
english
black
rat
which
is
the
common
house
rat
of
india
outside
the
large
seaports
has
become
through
centuries
of
contact
with
the
indian
people
a
domestic
animal
like
the
cat
in
britain
when
one
realises
the
fact
that
this
same
rat
is
responsible
for
the
spread
of
plague
in
india
and
that
every
house
is
full
of
them
the
value
of
this
naturalist
observation
is
plain
thus
began
an
intimacy
which
lasted
till
eha
death
in
the
first
time
i
met
aitken
was
at
a
meeting
of
the
free
church
of
scotland
literary
society
in
when
he
read
a
paper
on
the
early
experiences
of
the
english
in
bombay
the
minute
he
entered
the
room
i
recognised
him
from
the
caricatures
of
himself
in
the
the
long
thin
erect
bearded
man
was
unmistakable
with
a
typically
scots
face
lit
up
with
the
humorous
twinkle
one
came
to
know
so
well
many
a
time
in
has
that
look
been
seen
as
he
discoursed
as
only
he
could
on
the
ways
of
man
and
beast
bird
or
insect
as
one
tramped
with
him
through
the
jungles
on
the
hills
around
bombay
during
spent
with
him
at
vehar
or
elsewhere
he
was
an
ideal
companion
on
such
occasions
always
at
his
best
when
acting
the
part
of
naturalist
on
the
aitken
was
born
at
satara
in
the
bombay
presidency
on
august
his
father
was
the
rev
james
aitken
missionary
of
the
free
church
of
scotland
his
mother
was
a
sister
of
the
rev
daniel
edward
missionary
to
the
jews
at
breslau
for
some
fifty
years
he
was
educated
by
his
father
in
india
and
one
can
well
realise
the
sort
of
education
he
got
from
such
parents
from
the
many
allusions
to
the
bible
and
its
old
testament
characters
that
one
constantly
finds
used
with
such
effect
in
his
books
his
farther
education
was
obtained
at
bombay
and
poona
he
passed
and
of
bombay
university
first
on
the
list
and
won
the
homejee
cursetjee
prize
with
a
poem
in
from
to
he
was
latin
reader
in
the
deccan
college
at
poona
which
accounts
for
the
extensive
acquaintance
with
the
latin
classics
so
charmingly
manifest
in
his
writings
that
he
was
well
grounded
in
greek
is
also
certain
for
the
writer
while
living
in
a
chummery
with
him
in
bombay
in
saw
him
constantly
reading
the
greek
testament
in
the
mornings
without
the
aid
of
a
dictionary
he
entered
the
customs
and
salt
department
of
the
government
of
bombay
in
april
and
served
in
kharaghoda
the
dustypore
of
the
uran
north
kanara
and
goa
frontier
ratnagiri
and
bombay
itself
in
may
he
was
appointed
chief
collector
of
customs
and
salt
revenue
at
karachi
and
in
november
was
made
superintendent
in
charge
of
the
district
gazetteer
of
sind
he
retired
from
the
service
in
august
he
married
in
the
daughter
of
the
rev
chalmers
blake
and
left
a
family
of
two
sons
and
three
daughters
in
he
was
deputed
on
special
duty
to
investigate
the
prevalence
of
malaria
at
the
customs
stations
along
the
frontier
of
goa
and
to
devise
means
for
removing
the
salt
peons
at
these
posts
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
anopheles
mosquito
by
that
time
recognised
as
the
cause
of
the
deadly
malaria
which
made
service
on
that
frontier
dreaded
by
all
it
was
during
this
expedition
that
he
discovered
a
new
species
of
anopheline
mosquito
which
after
identification
by
major
james
was
named
after
him
during
his
long
service
there
are
to
be
found
in
the
annual
reports
of
the
customs
department
frequent
mention
of
aitken
good
work
but
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
government
ever
fully
realised
what
an
able
literary
man
they
had
in
their
service
wasting
his
talent
in
the
salt
department
on
two
occasions
only
did
congenial
work
come
to
him
in
the
course
of
his
public
duty
namely
when
he
was
sent
to
study
from
the
point
of
view
the
malarial
conditions
prevailing
on
the
frontier
of
goa
and
when
during
the
last
two
years
of
his
service
he
was
put
in
literary
charge
of
sind
in
this
book
one
can
see
the
light
and
graceful
literary
touch
of
eha
frequently
cropping
up
amidst
the
dry
bones
of
public
health
and
commercial
statistics
and
the
book
is
enlivened
by
innumerable
witty
and
philosophic
touches
appearing
in
the
most
unlikely
places
such
as
he
alone
could
enliven
a
dull
subject
with
would
that
all
government
gazetteers
were
similarly
adorned
but
there
are
not
many
ehas
in
government
employ
in
india
on
completion
of
this
work
he
retired
to
edinburgh
where
most
of
the
sketches
contained
in
this
volume
were
written
he
was
very
happy
with
his
family
in
his
home
at
morningside
and
was
beginning
to
surround
himself
with
pets
and
flowers
as
was
his
wont
all
his
life
and
to
get
a
good
connection
with
the
home
newspapers
and
magazines
when
alas
death
stepped
in
and
he
died
after
a
short
illness
on
april
he
was
interested
in
the
home
birds
and
beasts
as
he
had
been
with
those
in
india
and
the
last
time
the
writer
met
him
he
was
taking
home
some
for
his
aquarium
a
few
days
before
his
death
he
had
found
his
way
down
to
the
morningside
cemetery
where
he
had
been
enjoying
the
sunshine
and
flowers
of
spring
and
he
remarked
to
his
wife
that
he
would
often
go
there
in
future
to
watch
the
birds
building
their
nests
before
that
time
came
he
was
himself
laid
to
rest
in
that
very
spot
in
sure
and
certain
hope
of
a
blessed
resurrection
the
above
imperfect
sketch
fails
to
give
the
charm
and
magnetic
attraction
of
the
man
and
for
this
one
must
go
to
his
works
which
for
those
who
knew
him
are
very
illuminating
in
this
respect
in
them
one
catches
a
glimpse
of
his
plan
for
keeping
young
and
cheerful
in
the
land
of
regrets
for
one
of
his
charms
was
his
youthfulness
and
interest
in
life
he
refused
to
be
depressed
by
his
lonely
life
i
am
only
an
exile
he
remarks
endeavouring
to
work
a
successful
existence
in
dustypore
and
not
to
let
my
environment
shape
me
as
a
pudding
takes
the
shape
of
its
mould
but
to
make
it
tributary
to
my
own
happiness
he
therefore
urges
his
readers
to
cultivate
a
hobby
it
is
strange
he
says
that
europeans
in
india
know
so
little
see
so
little
care
so
little
about
all
the
intense
life
that
surrounds
them
the
boy
who
was
the
most
ardent
of
or
the
most
enthusiastic
of
in
england
where
one
shilling
will
buy
nearly
all
that
is
known
or
can
be
known
about
birds
or
butterflies
maintains
in
this
country
aided
by
b
an
unequal
strife
with
the
insupportableness
of
an
life
why
if
he
would
stir
up
for
one
day
the
embers
of
the
old
flame
he
could
not
quench
it
again
with
such
a
prairie
of
fuel
around
him
i
am
not
speaking
of
bombay
people
with
their
clubs
and
gymkhanas
and
other
devices
for
oiling
the
wheels
of
existence
but
of
the
dreary
exile
whose
life
is
a
blank
a
moral
sahara
a
catechism
of
the
nihilist
creed
what
such
a
one
needs
is
a
hobby
every
hobby
is
good
a
sign
of
good
and
an
influence
for
good
any
hobby
will
draw
out
the
mind
but
the
one
i
plead
for
touches
the
soul
too
keeps
the
milk
of
human
kindness
from
souring
puts
a
gentle
poetry
into
the
prosiest
life
that
all
my
own
finer
feelings
have
not
long
since
withered
in
this
land
of
separation
from
familiar
faces
i
attribute
partly
to
a
pair
of
rabbits
all
rabbits
are
idiotic
things
but
these
come
in
and
sit
up
meekly
and
beg
a
crust
of
bread
and
even
a
perennial
fare
of
village
can
not
induce
me
to
issue
the
order
for
their
execution
and
conversion
into
pie
but
if
such
considerations
can
not
lead
the
struggle
for
existence
should
drive
a
man
in
this
country
to
learn
the
ways
of
his
border
tribes
for
no
one
i
take
it
who
reflects
for
an
instant
will
deny
that
a
small
mosquito
with
black
rings
upon
a
white
ground
or
a
sparrow
that
has
finally
made
up
its
mind
to
rear
a
family
in
your
ceiling
exercises
an
influence
on
your
personal
happiness
far
beyond
the
czar
of
the
russias
it
is
not
a
question
of
scientific
frontiers
the
enemy
invades
us
on
all
sides
we
are
plundered
insulted
phlebotomised
under
our
own
vine
and
we
might
make
head
against
the
foe
if
we
laid
to
heart
the
lesson
our
national
history
in
india
teaches
namely
that
the
way
to
fight
uncivilised
enemies
is
to
encourage
them
to
cut
one
another
throats
and
then
step
in
and
inherit
the
spoil
but
we
murder
our
friends
exterminate
our
allies
and
then
groan
under
the
oppression
of
the
enemy
i
might
illustrate
this
by
the
case
of
the
meek
and
by
spiders
or
ants
but
these
must
wait
another
day
again
he
says
the
dumb
animals
can
give
each
other
a
bit
of
their
minds
like
their
betters
and
to
me
their
fierce
and
tender
little
passions
their
loves
and
hates
their
envies
and
jealousies
and
their
small
vanities
beget
a
sense
of
which
makes
their
presence
society
the
touch
of
nature
which
makes
the
whole
world
kin
is
infirmity
a
man
without
a
weakness
is
insupportable
company
and
so
is
a
man
who
does
not
feel
the
heat
there
is
a
large
grey
that
sits
in
the
blazing
sun
all
through
the
hottest
hours
of
the
day
and
says
coo
coo
until
the
melancholy
sweet
monotony
of
that
sound
is
as
thoroughly
mixed
up
in
my
brain
with
in
the
shade
as
physic
in
my
infantile
memories
with
the
peppermint
lozenges
which
used
to
away
the
taste
but
as
for
these
creatures
which
confess
the
heat
and
come
into
the
house
and
gasp
i
feel
drawn
to
them
i
should
like
to
offer
them
cooling
drinks
not
that
all
my
midday
guests
are
equally
welcome
i
could
dispense
for
instance
with
the
bee
which
has
just
reconnoitred
my
ear
for
the
third
time
and
guesses
it
is
a
she
is
away
just
now
but
only
i
fancy
for
clay
to
stop
it
up
with
there
are
others
also
to
which
i
would
give
their
if
they
would
take
it
but
good
bad
or
indifferent
they
give
us
their
company
whether
we
want
it
or
not
eha
certainly
found
company
in
beasts
all
his
life
and
kept
the
charm
of
youth
about
him
in
consequence
to
the
end
if
his
lot
were
cast
as
it
often
was
in
lonely
places
he
kept
pets
and
made
friends
besides
of
many
of
the
members
of
the
tribes
on
his
frontier
if
in
bombay
city
he
consoled
himself
with
his
aquarium
and
the
museum
of
the
bombay
natural
history
society
when
the
present
writer
chummed
with
him
in
a
flat
on
the
apollo
bunder
in
bombay
he
remembers
well
that
aquarium
and
the
expeditions
to
the
malarious
ravines
at
the
back
of
malabar
hill
to
search
for
mosquito
larvae
to
feed
its
inmates
for
at
that
time
aitken
was
investigating
the
capabilities
for
the
destruction
of
larvae
of
a
small
fish
with
an
spot
on
the
top
of
its
head
which
he
had
found
at
vehar
in
the
stream
below
the
bund
it
took
him
some
time
to
identify
these
particular
fishes
and
in
the
meantime
he
dubbed
them
scooties
from
the
lightning
rapidity
of
their
movements
and
in
his
own
admirable
manner
made
himself
a
sharer
of
their
joys
and
sorrows
their
cares
and
interests
with
these
he
stocked
the
ornamental
fountains
of
bombay
to
keep
them
from
becoming
for
mosquitoes
and
they
are
now
largely
used
throughout
india
for
this
very
purpose
it
will
be
recognised
therefore
that
aitken
studied
natural
history
not
only
for
its
own
sake
but
as
a
means
of
benefiting
the
people
of
india
whom
he
had
learned
to
love
as
is
so
plainly
shown
in
the
he
was
an
indefatigable
worker
in
the
museum
of
the
bombay
natural
history
society
which
he
helped
to
found
and
many
of
his
papers
and
notes
are
preserved
for
us
in
the
pages
of
its
excellent
of
which
he
was
an
original
he
was
for
long
secretary
of
the
insect
section
and
then
president
before
his
retirement
he
was
elected
one
of
the
of
the
society
aitken
was
a
deeply
religious
man
and
was
for
some
twenty
years
an
elder
in
the
congregation
of
the
united
free
church
of
scotland
in
bombay
he
was
for
some
years
superintendent
of
the
sunday
school
in
connection
with
this
congregation
and
a
member
of
the
committee
of
the
bombay
scottish
orphanage
and
the
scottish
high
schools
his
former
minister
says
of
him
he
was
deeply
interested
in
theology
and
remained
wonderfully
orthodox
in
spite
of
or
as
the
present
writer
would
prefer
to
say
his
scientific
knowledge
he
always
thought
that
the
evidence
for
the
doctrine
of
evolution
had
been
pressed
for
more
than
it
was
worth
and
he
had
many
criticisms
to
make
upon
the
higher
critics
of
the
bible
many
a
discussion
we
had
in
which
against
me
he
took
the
conservative
side
he
lets
one
see
very
clearly
into
the
workings
of
his
mind
in
this
direction
in
what
is
perhaps
the
finest
although
the
least
well
known
of
his
books
five
windows
of
the
john
murray
in
which
he
discourses
in
his
own
inimitable
way
of
the
five
senses
and
how
they
bring
man
and
beast
into
contact
with
their
surroundings
it
is
a
book
on
perceiving
and
shows
how
according
as
this
faculty
is
exercised
it
makes
each
man
such
as
he
is
the
following
extract
from
the
book
shows
aitken
style
and
may
perhaps
induce
some
to
go
to
the
book
itself
for
more
from
the
same
source
he
is
speaking
of
the
moral
sense
and
it
is
almost
a
truism
to
say
that
if
a
man
has
any
taste
it
will
show
itself
in
his
dress
and
in
his
dwelling
no
doubt
through
indolence
and
slovenly
habits
a
man
may
allow
his
surroundings
to
fall
far
below
what
he
is
capable
of
approving
but
every
one
who
does
so
pays
the
penalty
in
the
gradual
deterioration
of
his
perceptions
how
many
times
more
true
is
all
this
in
the
case
of
the
moral
sense
when
the
heart
is
still
young
and
tender
how
spontaneously
and
sweetly
and
urgently
does
every
vision
of
goodness
and
nobleness
in
the
conduct
of
another
awaken
the
impulse
to
go
and
do
likewise
and
if
that
impulse
is
not
obeyed
how
certainly
does
the
first
approving
perception
of
the
beauty
of
goodness
become
duller
until
at
last
we
may
even
come
to
hate
it
where
we
find
it
for
its
discordance
with
the
of
sins
in
our
members
but
not
less
certainly
will
every
earnest
effort
to
bring
the
life
into
unison
with
what
we
perceive
to
be
right
bring
its
own
reward
in
a
clearer
and
more
joyful
perception
of
what
is
right
and
a
keener
sensitiveness
to
every
discord
in
ourselves
how
all
such
discord
may
be
removed
how
the
chords
of
the
heart
may
be
tuned
and
the
life
become
music
these
are
questions
of
religion
which
are
quite
beyond
our
scope
but
i
take
it
that
every
religion
which
has
prevailed
among
the
children
of
adam
is
in
itself
an
evidence
that
however
debased
and
perverted
the
moral
sense
may
have
become
the
painful
consciousness
that
his
heart
is
sweet
bells
jangled
still
presses
everywhere
and
always
on
the
spirit
of
man
and
it
is
also
a
conscious
or
unconscious
admission
that
there
is
no
blessedness
for
him
until
his
life
shall
march
in
step
with
the
music
of
the
righteousness
aitken
name
will
be
kept
green
among
by
the
series
of
books
published
by
thacker
of
london
and
calcutta
they
are
tribes
on
my
frontier
an
indian
naturalist
foreign
which
was
published
in
and
of
which
a
seventh
edition
appeared
in
this
book
deals
with
the
common
birds
beasts
and
insects
in
and
around
an
indian
bungalow
and
it
should
be
put
into
the
hands
of
every
one
whose
lot
is
cast
in
india
it
will
open
their
eyes
to
the
beauty
and
interests
of
their
surroundings
in
a
truly
wonderful
way
and
may
be
read
again
and
again
with
increasing
pleasure
as
one
experience
of
indian
life
increases
this
was
followed
in
by
the
which
describes
with
charming
insight
the
strange
manners
and
customs
of
our
indian
domestic
servants
the
witty
and
yet
kindly
way
in
which
their
excellencies
and
defects
are
touched
off
is
delightful
and
many
a
harassed
must
bless
eha
for
showing
her
the
humorous
and
human
side
of
her
life
surrounded
as
it
is
by
those
necessary
but
annoying
inhabitants
of
the
godowns
behind
the
bungalow
a
tenth
edition
of
this
book
was
published
in
naturalist
on
the
was
brought
out
in
and
a
third
edition
was
published
in
it
contains
sketches
on
the
same
lines
as
those
in
but
deals
more
with
the
jungles
and
not
so
much
with
the
immediate
surroundings
of
the
bungalow
the
very
smell
of
the
country
is
in
these
chapters
and
will
vividly
recall
memories
to
those
who
know
the
country
along
the
west
coast
of
india
southward
of
bombay
in
was
published
common
birds
of
which
contains
descriptions
of
the
ordinary
birds
one
sees
about
the
bungalow
or
in
the
country
as
is
well
said
by
the
writer
of
the
obituary
notice
in
the
of
the
bombay
natural
history
society
eha
had
a
special
genius
for
seizing
the
striking
and
characteristic
points
in
the
appearance
and
behaviour
of
individual
species
and
a
happy
knack
of
translating
them
into
print
so
as
to
render
his
descriptions
unmistakable
he
looked
upon
all
creatures
in
the
proper
way
as
if
each
had
a
soul
and
character
of
its
own
he
loved
them
all
and
was
unwilling
to
hurt
any
of
them
these
characteristics
are
well
shown
in
this
book
for
one
is
able
to
recognise
the
birds
easily
from
some
prominent
feature
described
therein
five
windows
of
the
published
by
john
murray
in
is
of
quite
another
character
from
the
above
and
was
regarded
by
its
author
with
great
affection
as
the
best
of
his
books
it
is
certainly
a
wonderfully
book
and
full
of
the
most
beautiful
thoughts
a
second
impression
appeared
in
the
following
year
and
a
new
and
cheaper
edition
has
just
been
published
the
portrait
of
eha
is
reproduced
from
one
taken
in
in
a
flat
on
the
apollo
bunder
and
shows
the
man
as
he
was
in
workaday
life
in
bombay
the
humorous
and
kindly
look
is
i
think
well
brought
out
and
will
stir
pleasant
memories
in
all
who
knew
aitken
b
madras
footnotes
footnote
the
illustrations
are
his
own
work
but
the
blocks
having
been
produced
in
india
they
do
not
do
justice
to
the
extreme
delicacy
of
workmanship
and
fine
perception
of
detail
which
characterise
the
originals
as
all
who
have
been
privileged
to
see
these
will
agree
concerning
animals
i
feet
and
hands
it
is
evident
that
in
what
is
called
the
evolution
of
animal
forms
the
foot
came
in
suddenly
when
the
backboned
creatures
began
to
live
on
the
dry
land
that
is
with
the
frogs
how
it
came
in
is
a
question
which
still
puzzles
the
phylogenists
who
can
not
find
a
sure
pedigree
for
the
frog
there
it
is
anyhow
and
the
remarkable
point
about
it
is
that
the
foot
of
a
frog
is
not
a
rudimentary
thing
but
an
authentic
standard
foot
like
the
yard
measure
kept
in
the
tower
of
london
of
which
all
other
feet
are
copies
or
adaptations
this
instrument
as
part
of
the
original
outfit
given
to
the
pioneers
of
the
brainy
backboned
and
races
when
they
were
sent
out
to
multiply
and
replenish
the
earth
is
surely
worth
considering
well
it
consists
essentially
of
a
sole
or
palm
made
up
of
small
bones
and
of
separate
digits
each
with
several
joints
illustration
an
authentic
standard
foot
in
the
hind
foot
of
a
frog
the
toes
are
very
long
and
webbed
from
point
to
point
in
this
it
differs
a
good
deal
from
the
toad
and
there
is
significance
in
the
difference
the
toad
satisfied
with
sour
ants
hard
beetles
and
such
other
fare
as
it
can
easily
pick
up
and
grown
nasty
in
consequence
so
that
nothing
seeks
to
eat
it
has
hobbled
through
life
like
a
plethoric
old
gentleman
until
the
present
day
on
its
original
feet
the
more
versatile
and
frog
seeking
better
diet
and
greater
security
of
life
went
back
to
the
element
in
which
it
was
bred
and
swimming
much
became
better
fitted
for
swimming
the
soft
elastic
skin
between
the
fingers
or
toes
is
just
the
sort
of
tissue
which
responds
most
readily
to
inward
impulses
and
we
find
that
the
very
same
change
has
come
about
in
those
birds
and
beasts
which
live
much
in
water
i
know
that
this
is
not
the
accepted
theory
of
evolution
but
i
am
waiting
till
it
shall
become
so
we
all
develop
in
the
direction
of
our
tendencies
and
shall
i
doubt
not
be
wise
enough
some
day
to
give
animals
leave
to
do
the
same
it
seems
strange
that
any
creature
furnished
with
such
tricky
and
adaptable
instruments
to
go
about
the
world
with
should
tire
of
them
and
wish
to
get
rid
of
them
but
so
it
happened
at
a
very
early
stage
it
must
have
been
a
consequence
i
think
of
growing
too
fast
mark
twain
remarked
about
a
dachshund
that
it
seemed
to
want
another
pair
of
legs
in
the
middle
to
prevent
it
sagging
now
some
lizards
are
so
long
that
they
can
not
keep
from
sagging
and
their
progress
becomes
a
painful
wriggle
but
if
you
must
go
by
wriggling
then
what
is
the
use
of
legs
to
knock
against
stems
and
stones
so
some
lizards
have
discarded
two
of
their
legs
and
some
all
four
zoologically
they
are
not
snakes
but
snakes
are
only
a
further
advance
in
the
same
direction
that
snakes
did
not
start
fair
without
legs
is
clear
for
the
python
has
to
this
day
two
buried
in
its
flesh
when
we
pass
from
reptiles
to
birds
lo
an
astounding
thing
has
happened
that
there
were
flying
reptiles
in
the
fossil
ages
we
know
and
there
are
flying
beasts
in
our
own
but
the
wings
of
these
are
simple
mechanical
alterations
which
the
imagination
of
a
child
or
a
savage
could
explain
the
hands
of
a
bat
are
hands
still
and
though
the
fingers
are
hampered
by
their
awkward
gloves
the
thumbs
are
free
the
giant
fruit
bats
of
the
tropics
clamber
about
the
trees
quite
acrobatically
with
their
thumbs
and
feet
that
apollyonic
monster
of
the
prime
the
pterodactyl
did
even
better
stretching
on
each
little
finger
a
lateen
sail
that
would
have
served
to
waft
a
skiff
across
the
thames
it
kept
the
rest
of
its
hands
for
other
uses
but
what
bearing
has
all
this
on
the
case
of
birds
here
is
a
whole
as
they
call
it
of
the
animal
world
which
has
unreservedly
and
irrevocably
bartered
one
pair
of
its
limbs
for
a
the
apparatus
is
made
of
feathers
a
new
invention
unknown
to
amphibian
or
saurian
whence
obtained
nobody
can
say
and
these
are
grafted
into
the
transformed
frame
of
the
old
limbs
the
bargain
was
worth
making
for
the
winged
bird
at
once
soared
away
in
all
senses
from
the
creeping
things
of
earth
and
became
a
more
ethereal
being
like
a
blown
flame
it
rests
upon
the
air
subdues
it
surpasses
it
outraces
it
it
is
the
air
conscious
of
itself
conquering
itself
ruling
itself
but
the
price
was
heavy
the
bird
must
get
through
life
with
one
pair
of
feet
and
its
mouth
but
this
was
all
the
bodily
furniture
of
charles
françois
felu
who
without
arms
became
a
famous
artist
a
friend
of
mine
standing
behind
him
in
a
and
watching
him
at
work
saw
him
lay
down
his
brush
and
raising
his
foot
to
his
head
take
off
his
hat
and
scratch
his
crown
with
his
great
toe
my
friend
was
nearly
hypnotised
by
the
sight
yet
it
scarcely
strikes
us
as
a
wonder
when
a
parrot
standing
on
one
foot
takes
its
meals
with
the
other
it
is
a
wonder
and
stamps
the
parrot
as
a
bird
of
talent
a
mine
of
hidden
possibilities
is
in
us
all
but
those
who
dig
resolutely
into
it
and
bring
out
treasure
are
few
and
let
us
note
that
the
art
of
standing
began
with
birds
frogs
sit
and
as
far
as
i
know
every
reptile
be
it
lizard
crocodile
alligator
or
tortoise
lays
its
body
on
the
ground
when
not
actually
carrying
it
and
these
have
each
four
fat
legs
contrast
the
flamingo
which
having
only
two
and
those
like
willow
wands
tucks
up
one
of
them
and
sleeps
poised
high
on
the
other
like
a
tulip
on
its
stem
note
also
that
one
toe
has
been
altogether
discarded
by
birds
as
superfluous
the
germ
or
bud
must
be
there
for
the
dorking
fowl
has
produced
a
fifth
toe
under
some
influence
of
the
but
no
natural
bird
has
more
than
four
except
in
swifts
which
never
perch
but
cling
to
rocks
and
walls
one
is
turned
backwards
and
by
a
cunning
contrivance
the
act
of
bending
the
leg
draws
them
all
automatically
together
so
a
hen
closes
its
toes
at
every
step
it
takes
as
if
it
grasped
something
and
of
course
when
it
settles
down
on
its
roost
they
grasp
that
tight
and
hold
it
fast
till
morning
but
to
birds
that
do
not
perch
this
mechanism
is
only
an
encumbrance
so
many
of
them
like
the
plovers
abolish
the
hind
toe
entirely
and
the
prince
of
all
runners
the
ostrich
has
got
rid
of
one
of
the
front
toes
also
retaining
only
two
illustration
these
beasts
are
all
clodhoppers
and
their
feet
are
hobnailed
boots
to
a
man
who
thinks
it
is
very
interesting
to
observe
that
beasts
have
been
led
along
gradually
in
the
very
same
direction
all
the
common
beasts
such
as
cats
dogs
rats
stoats
and
so
on
have
five
ordinary
toes
on
the
hind
feet
there
may
be
only
four
but
as
soon
as
we
come
to
those
that
feed
on
grass
and
leaves
standing
or
walking
all
the
while
we
find
that
the
feet
are
shod
with
hoofs
instead
of
being
tipped
with
claws
first
the
five
toes
though
clubbed
together
have
each
a
separate
hoof
as
in
the
elephant
then
the
hippopotamus
follows
with
four
toes
and
the
rhinoceros
with
practically
three
these
beasts
are
all
clodhoppers
and
their
feet
are
hobnailed
boots
the
more
active
deer
and
all
cattle
keep
only
two
toes
for
practical
purposes
though
stumps
of
two
more
remain
finally
the
horse
gathers
all
its
foot
into
one
boot
and
becomes
the
champion
runner
of
the
world
it
is
not
without
significance
that
this
degeneracy
of
the
feet
goes
with
a
decline
in
the
brain
whether
as
cause
or
effect
i
will
not
pretend
to
know
these
hoofed
beasts
have
shallow
natures
and
live
shallow
lives
they
eat
what
is
spread
by
nature
before
their
noses
have
no
homes
and
do
nothing
but
feed
and
fight
with
each
other
the
elephant
is
a
notable
exception
but
then
the
nose
of
the
elephant
becoming
a
hand
has
redeemed
its
mind
as
for
the
horse
whatever
its
admirers
may
say
it
is
just
a
great
ass
there
is
a
lesson
in
all
this
from
him
that
hath
not
shall
be
taken
even
that
which
he
hath
there
is
another
dull
beast
which
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
mere
systematist
seems
as
far
removed
from
those
that
wear
hoofs
as
it
could
be
but
the
philosopher
considering
the
point
at
which
it
has
arrived
rather
than
the
route
by
which
it
got
there
will
class
it
with
them
for
its
idea
of
life
is
just
theirs
turned
the
nails
of
the
sloth
instead
of
being
hammered
into
hoofs
on
the
hard
ground
have
grown
long
and
curved
like
those
of
a
caged
bird
and
become
hooks
by
which
it
can
hang
without
effort
in
the
midst
of
the
leaves
on
which
it
feeds
a
minimum
of
intellect
is
required
for
such
an
existence
and
the
sloth
has
lost
any
superfluous
brain
that
it
may
have
had
as
well
as
two
or
even
three
of
its
five
toes
to
return
to
those
birds
and
beasts
with
standard
feet
i
find
that
the
first
outside
purpose
for
which
they
find
them
serviceable
is
to
scratch
themselves
this
is
a
universal
need
but
a
foot
is
handy
in
many
other
ways
a
hen
and
chickens
getting
into
my
garden
transferred
a
whole
to
the
walk
in
half
an
hour
yet
a
bird
trying
to
do
anything
with
its
foot
is
like
a
man
putting
on
his
socks
standing
and
birds
as
a
race
have
turned
their
feet
to
very
little
account
outside
of
their
original
purpose
such
a
simple
thing
as
holding
down
its
food
with
one
foot
scarcely
occurs
to
an
ordinary
bird
a
hen
will
pull
about
a
cabbage
leaf
and
shake
it
in
the
hope
that
a
small
piece
may
come
away
but
it
never
enters
her
head
to
put
her
foot
on
it
in
this
and
other
matters
the
parrot
stands
apart
and
also
the
hawk
eagle
and
owl
but
these
are
not
ordinary
birds
beasts
having
twice
as
many
feet
as
birds
have
learned
to
apply
them
to
many
uses
they
dig
with
them
hold
down
their
food
with
them
fondle
their
children
with
them
paw
their
friends
and
scratch
their
enemies
one
does
more
of
one
thing
and
another
of
another
and
the
feet
soon
show
the
effects
of
the
occupation
the
claws
first
then
the
muscles
and
even
the
bones
dwindling
by
disuse
or
waxing
stout
and
strong
then
the
joy
of
doing
what
it
can
do
well
impels
the
beast
further
on
the
same
path
and
its
offspring
after
it
illustration
the
nose
of
the
elephant
becoming
a
hand
has
redeemed
its
mind
and
this
leads
at
last
to
specialism
the
indian
black
bear
is
a
handy
man
like
the
british
tar
good
all
round
its
great
soft
paw
is
a
very
serviceable
tool
and
weapon
armed
with
claws
which
will
take
the
face
off
a
man
or
grub
up
a
root
with
equal
ease
when
a
black
bear
has
found
an
it
takes
but
a
few
minutes
to
tear
up
the
hard
cemented
clay
and
lay
the
deep
galleries
bare
then
putting
its
muzzle
to
the
mouth
of
each
it
draws
such
a
blast
of
air
through
them
that
the
industrious
labourers
are
sucked
into
its
gullet
in
drifts
afterwards
it
digs
right
down
to
the
royal
chamber
licks
up
the
bloated
queen
and
goes
its
way
but
there
is
another
worker
in
the
same
mine
which
does
not
go
to
work
this
way
the
found
fat
termites
so
satisfying
that
it
left
all
other
things
and
devoted
its
life
to
the
exploiting
of
anthills
and
now
it
has
no
rival
at
that
business
but
it
is
fit
for
nothing
else
its
awkward
digging
tools
will
not
allow
it
to
put
the
sole
of
its
foot
to
the
ground
so
it
has
to
double
them
under
and
hobble
about
like
a
chinese
lady
it
has
no
teeth
and
stupidity
is
the
most
prominent
feature
of
its
character
it
has
become
that
poor
thing
a
man
of
one
idea
but
the
bear
is
like
a
at
a
parting
of
the
ways
if
you
compare
a
brown
bear
with
the
black
indian
or
sloth
bear
as
it
is
sometimes
called
you
may
detect
a
small
but
pregnant
difference
when
the
former
walks
its
claws
are
lifted
so
that
their
points
do
not
touch
the
ground
why
i
have
no
information
but
i
know
that
it
is
not
content
with
a
vegetarian
diet
like
its
black
relative
but
hankers
after
sheep
and
goats
and
i
guess
that
its
murderous
thoughts
flow
down
its
nerves
to
those
keen
claws
it
reminds
me
of
a
man
clenching
his
fist
unconsciously
when
he
thinks
of
the
liar
who
has
slandered
him
illustration
it
has
to
double
them
under
and
hobble
about
like
a
chinese
lady
but
what
ages
of
concentration
on
the
thought
and
practice
of
assassination
must
have
been
required
to
perfect
that
most
awful
weapon
in
nature
the
paw
of
a
tiger
or
indeed
of
any
cat
for
they
are
all
of
one
pattern
the
sharpened
flint
of
the
savage
has
become
the
scimitar
of
saladin
keeping
the
keenness
of
its
edge
in
a
velvet
sheath
and
flashing
out
only
on
the
field
of
battle
compare
that
paw
with
the
foot
of
a
dog
and
you
will
perhaps
see
with
me
that
the
servility
and
pliancy
of
the
slave
of
man
has
usurped
a
place
in
his
esteem
which
is
not
its
due
the
cat
is
much
the
nobler
animal
dogs
with
wolves
jackals
and
all
of
their
kin
love
to
fall
upon
their
victim
in
overwhelming
force
like
a
rascally
mob
and
bite
tear
and
worry
until
the
life
has
gone
out
of
it
the
tiger
rushing
with
a
fearful
challenge
on
the
gigantic
buffalo
grasps
its
nose
with
one
paw
and
its
shoulder
with
the
other
and
has
broken
its
massive
neck
in
a
manner
so
dexterous
and
instantaneous
that
scarcely
two
sportsmen
can
agree
about
how
the
thing
is
done
i
have
said
that
the
foot
first
appeared
when
the
backboned
creatures
came
out
of
the
waters
to
live
upon
the
dry
land
but
all
mundane
things
not
excepting
politics
tend
to
move
in
circles
ending
where
they
began
and
so
the
foot
if
we
follow
it
far
enough
will
take
us
back
into
water
see
how
the
rat
i
mean
our
common
omnivorous
scavenging
thieving
poaching
brown
rat
when
it
lives
near
a
pond
or
stream
learns
to
swim
and
dive
as
naturally
as
a
duck
next
comes
the
vole
or
which
will
not
live
away
from
water
then
there
are
water
shrews
the
beaver
otter
platypus
and
a
host
of
others
not
related
just
as
among
birds
there
are
water
ousels
moorhens
ducks
divers
which
have
permanently
made
the
water
their
home
and
seek
their
living
in
it
all
these
have
attained
to
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
that
this
has
occurred
among
reptiles
beasts
and
birds
alike
shows
what
an
easy
or
natural
or
obvious
put
it
as
you
will
modification
it
is
and
it
has
a
consequence
not
to
be
escaped
just
as
a
man
who
rides
a
great
deal
and
never
walks
acquires
a
certain
indirectness
of
the
legs
and
you
never
mistake
a
jockey
for
a
so
the
beasts
are
not
among
the
things
that
are
comely
in
going
following
this
road
you
arrive
at
the
seal
and
of
all
the
feet
that
i
have
looked
at
i
know
only
one
more
utterly
ridiculous
than
the
twisted
flipper
on
which
the
props
his
great
bulk
in
front
and
that
is
the
forked
which
extends
from
the
hinder
parts
of
the
same
how
can
it
be
worth
any
beast
while
to
carry
such
an
absurd
apparatus
with
it
just
for
the
sake
of
getting
out
into
the
air
sometimes
and
pushing
itself
about
on
the
ice
and
being
eaten
by
polar
bears
the
porpoise
has
discarded
one
pair
turned
the
other
into
decent
fins
and
recovered
a
grace
and
power
of
motion
in
water
which
are
not
equalled
by
the
greyhound
on
land
why
have
the
seals
hung
back
i
believe
i
know
the
secret
it
is
the
baby
no
one
knows
where
the
porpoise
and
the
whale
cradle
their
newborn
infants
it
is
so
difficult
to
pry
into
the
domestic
ways
of
these
but
evidently
the
seals
can
not
manage
it
so
they
are
forced
to
return
to
the
land
when
the
cares
of
maternity
are
on
them
i
have
called
the
feet
of
these
sea
beasts
ridiculous
things
and
so
they
are
as
we
see
them
but
strip
off
the
skin
and
lo
there
appears
a
plain
foot
with
its
five
digits
each
of
several
joints
tipped
with
claws
nowise
essentially
different
in
short
from
that
with
which
the
toad
or
frog
first
set
out
in
a
past
too
distant
for
our
infirm
imagination
admiration
itself
is
paralysed
by
a
contrivance
so
simple
so
transmutable
and
so
sufficient
for
every
need
that
time
and
change
could
bring
there
remains
yet
one
transformation
which
seems
simple
compared
with
some
that
i
have
noticed
but
is
more
full
of
fate
than
they
all
for
by
it
the
foot
becomes
a
hand
this
comes
about
by
easy
stages
the
reason
why
one
of
a
bird
four
toes
is
turned
back
is
quite
plain
trees
are
the
proper
home
of
birds
and
they
require
feet
that
will
grasp
branches
so
those
beasts
also
that
have
taken
to
living
in
trees
have
got
one
toe
detached
more
or
less
from
the
rest
and
arranged
so
that
it
can
with
them
to
catch
hold
of
a
thing
then
other
changes
quickly
follow
for
in
judging
whether
you
have
got
hold
of
a
thing
and
how
much
force
you
must
put
forth
to
keep
hold
of
it
you
are
guided
entirely
by
the
pressure
on
the
and
to
gauge
this
pressure
nicely
the
nerves
must
be
refined
and
educated
in
fact
the
exercise
itself
with
the
intent
direction
of
the
mind
to
the
brings
about
the
refinement
and
education
in
accordance
with
sandow
principle
of
muscle
culture
for
an
example
of
the
result
do
not
look
at
the
gross
paw
of
any
anthropoid
ape
gorilla
or
chimpanzee
but
study
the
gentle
lemur
at
the
point
of
each
digit
is
a
broad
elastic
pad
plentifully
supplied
with
delicate
nerves
and
the
vital
energy
which
has
been
directed
into
them
appears
to
have
been
withdrawn
from
the
growth
of
the
claws
which
have
shrunk
into
fine
nails
just
shielding
the
fleshy
tips
in
short
the
lemur
has
a
hand
on
each
of
its
four
limbs
and
no
feet
at
all
and
as
it
goes
about
its
cage
i
am
at
the
zoo
in
spirit
with
a
silent
wonder
shining
out
of
its
great
eyes
it
examines
things
by
them
with
its
hands
how
plainly
a
new
avenue
from
the
outer
world
into
its
mind
has
been
opened
by
those
fingers
but
how
about
scratching
what
would
be
the
gain
of
having
higher
susceptibilities
and
keener
perceptions
if
they
only
aggravated
the
triumph
of
the
insulting
flea
nay
this
disaster
has
been
averted
by
reserving
a
good
sharp
claw
on
the
forefinger
not
the
thumb
of
each
hind
hand
the
old
naturalists
called
the
apes
and
lemurs
quadrumana
the
and
separated
the
bimana
with
one
species
namely
now
we
have
anatomy
cited
to
belittle
the
difference
between
a
hand
and
a
foot
and
geology
importuned
to
show
us
the
missing
link
pending
which
an
order
has
been
instituted
roomy
enough
to
hold
monkeys
gorillas
and
men
it
is
a
strange
perversity
how
much
more
fitting
it
were
to
bow
in
reverent
ignorance
before
the
perfect
hand
taken
up
from
the
ground
no
more
to
dull
its
percipient
surfaces
on
earth
and
stones
and
bark
but
to
minister
to
its
lord
expanding
mind
and
obey
his
creative
will
while
his
frame
stands
upright
and
firm
upon
a
single
pair
of
true
feet
with
their
toes
all
in
one
rank
ii
bills
of
birds
the
prospectus
or
advertisement
of
a
certain
american
typewriting
machine
commences
by
informing
the
public
that
the
typewriter
is
founded
on
an
idea
when
i
saw
this
phrase
i
secured
it
for
my
collection
for
i
felt
that
without
jest
it
contained
the
kernel
of
a
true
philosophy
of
nature
the
forms
the
of
nature
are
innumerable
multifarious
interwoven
and
infinitely
perplexing
and
you
may
spend
a
happy
life
in
unravelling
their
relations
and
devising
their
evolutions
but
until
you
have
looked
through
them
and
seen
the
ideas
that
are
behind
them
you
are
a
mere
materialist
and
a
blind
worker
the
soul
of
nature
is
hid
from
you
what
is
the
bill
of
a
bird
and
what
does
it
mean
i
do
not
refer
to
the
bill
of
a
hawk
or
a
heron
or
an
owl
or
an
ostrich
but
to
that
which
is
the
abstract
of
all
these
and
a
thousand
more
i
hold
regardless
of
anatomy
and
physiology
that
a
bird
is
a
higher
being
than
a
beast
no
beast
soars
and
sings
to
its
sweetheart
no
beast
remains
in
lifelong
partnership
with
the
wife
of
its
youth
no
beast
builds
itself
a
and
decks
it
with
feathers
and
bright
shells
a
beast
is
a
grovelling
denizen
of
the
earth
a
bird
is
a
free
citizen
of
the
air
and
who
can
say
that
there
is
not
a
connection
between
this
difference
and
other
developments
the
beast
thinking
only
of
its
appetites
has
evolved
a
delicate
nose
a
discriminating
palate
three
kinds
of
teeth
to
cut
tear
and
grind
its
food
salivary
glands
to
moisten
the
same
and
a
perfected
apparatus
of
digestion
illustration
good
for
any
rough
job
the
bird
occupied
with
thoughts
of
love
and
beauty
with
fields
or
waves
or
mountains
and
shapes
of
sky
or
plain
has
made
little
advance
in
the
art
and
instruments
of
good
living
it
swallows
its
food
whole
scarcely
knowing
the
taste
of
it
and
a
pair
of
forceps
for
picking
it
up
tipped
and
cased
with
horn
is
the
whole
of
its
dining
furniture
for
the
bill
of
a
bird
primarily
and
essentially
is
that
and
nothing
else
in
the
chickens
and
the
sparrows
that
come
to
steal
their
food
and
the
robin
that
looks
on
and
all
the
little
you
may
see
it
in
its
simplicity
the
size
and
shape
may
vary
as
a
canadian
axe
differs
from
a
scotch
axe
some
are
short
and
stout
and
have
a
sharp
edge
for
shelling
seeds
some
are
longer
and
for
picking
worms
and
caterpillars
out
of
their
some
a
little
hooked
at
their
points
and
one
that
of
the
crossbill
with
points
crossed
for
picking
the
small
seeds
out
of
but
all
are
practically
the
same
tool
yet
the
last
distinctly
points
the
way
to
those
modifications
by
which
the
simple
bill
is
gradually
adapted
to
one
special
purpose
or
another
until
it
becomes
a
wonderful
mechanism
in
which
the
original
intention
is
quite
out
of
sight
at
this
point
i
find
an
instructive
parable
in
my
tool
chest
fully
half
of
the
tools
are
just
knives
a
chisel
is
a
knife
a
plane
is
a
knife
set
in
a
block
of
wood
a
saw
is
a
knife
with
the
edge
notched
moreover
there
are
many
sorts
of
curious
planes
and
saws
each
intended
for
one
distinct
kind
of
fine
work
all
these
the
joiner
has
need
of
but
a
schoolboy
would
rather
have
one
good
strong
than
the
whole
boxful
for
just
in
proportion
as
each
tool
is
perfected
for
its
own
special
work
it
becomes
useless
for
any
other
and
your
schoolboy
is
not
a
specialist
he
wants
a
tool
that
will
cut
a
stick
carve
a
boat
peel
an
apple
dig
out
a
worm
in
short
one
that
will
do
whatever
his
active
mind
wants
done
now
apply
this
parable
to
the
birds
if
you
see
a
bill
that
is
nothing
but
a
large
and
powerful
pair
of
forceps
good
for
any
rough
job
you
may
know
without
further
inquiry
that
the
owner
is
no
limited
specialist
but
a
handy
man
bold
enterprising
resourceful
and
good
all
round
he
will
not
starve
in
the
desert
no
wholesome
food
comes
amiss
to
him
grub
slug
or
snail
fruit
eggs
a
live
mouse
or
a
dead
rat
and
he
can
deal
with
them
all
such
are
the
magpie
the
crow
the
jackdaw
and
all
of
that
ilk
and
these
are
the
birds
that
are
found
in
all
countries
and
climates
and
prosper
wherever
they
go
illustration
no
doubt
each
bird
swears
by
its
own
pattern
but
all
birds
can
not
play
that
part
one
is
timid
another
fastidious
another
shy
but
ingenious
so
in
the
universal
competition
for
a
living
each
has
taken
its
own
line
according
to
the
bent
of
its
nature
and
its
one
tool
has
been
perfected
for
its
trade
until
it
can
follow
no
other
the
thrush
catches
such
worms
as
rashly
show
themselves
but
an
ancient
ancestor
of
the
snipe
found
that
if
it
followed
them
into
marshy
lands
it
could
probe
the
soft
ground
and
drag
them
out
of
their
chambers
for
this
operation
it
has
now
a
bill
three
inches
long
straight
thin
and
sensitive
at
the
tip
a
beautiful
instrument
but
good
for
no
purpose
except
extracting
worms
from
soft
ground
if
frost
or
drought
hardens
the
ground
the
snipe
must
starve
or
travel
among
the
many
lang
nebbit
birds
that
follow
the
same
profession
as
the
snipe
some
like
the
curlew
and
the
ibis
have
curved
bills
of
prodigious
length
i
do
not
know
the
comparative
advantages
of
the
two
forms
but
no
doubt
each
bird
swears
by
its
own
pattern
as
every
golfer
does
by
his
own
putter
but
now
behold
another
which
distasting
mud
has
discovered
an
unworked
mine
in
the
trunks
of
trees
there
in
deep
burrows
lurked
great
succulent
demanding
only
a
tool
with
which
they
might
be
dug
out
this
has
been
perfected
by
many
stages
and
i
have
now
before
me
a
splendid
specimen
of
the
most
improved
pattern
namely
the
bill
of
the
great
black
woodpecker
of
western
india
a
bird
nearly
as
big
as
a
crow
it
is
nothing
else
than
a
hatchet
in
two
parts
which
when
locked
together
present
a
steeled
edge
about
of
an
inch
in
breadth
the
hatchet
is
two
and
a
half
inches
long
by
one
in
breadth
at
the
base
and
a
prominent
ridge
or
keel
runs
down
the
top
from
base
to
point
it
is
further
strengthened
by
a
keel
on
each
side
inside
of
it
ere
the
bird
became
a
mummy
was
her
tongue
which
i
myself
drew
out
three
inches
beyond
the
point
of
the
bill
it
was
rough
and
tough
like
tipped
with
a
fine
spike
and
armed
on
each
side
for
the
last
inch
of
its
length
with
a
row
of
sharp
barbs
pointing
backwards
the
whole
was
lubricated
with
some
patent
stickfast
always
ready
for
use
that
grub
must
sit
tight
indeed
which
this
corkscrew
will
not
draw
when
once
the
hatchet
has
opened
a
way
the
swallows
and
swifts
untirable
on
their
wings
but
too
gentle
to
hold
their
own
in
a
jostling
crowd
soared
away
after
the
midges
and
and
pestilent
gnats
that
rise
from
marsh
and
pond
to
hold
their
joyous
dances
under
the
blue
dome
continually
rushing
after
these
they
have
stretched
their
gape
from
ear
to
ear
but
their
bills
have
dwindled
by
disuse
and
left
only
an
apology
for
their
absence
compared
with
all
these
the
birds
that
can
do
with
a
diet
of
fruit
only
lead
an
easy
life
they
have
just
to
pluck
and
eat
that
is
if
they
are
pleased
with
small
fruits
and
content
to
swallow
them
whole
but
the
hornbills
being
too
bulky
to
hop
among
twigs
need
a
long
reach
hence
the
portentous
machines
which
they
carry
on
their
faces
the
beak
of
a
hornbill
is
nothing
else
than
a
pair
of
tongs
long
enough
to
reach
and
strong
enough
to
wrench
off
a
wild
fig
from
its
thick
stem
if
it
were
of
iron
it
would
be
thin
and
heavy
being
of
cellular
it
is
bulky
but
light
if
you
ask
why
it
should
rise
up
into
an
absurd
helmet
on
the
queer
fowl
head
i
can
not
tell
nature
has
quaint
ways
of
using
up
surplus
material
illustration
its
bill
deserves
study
an
easy
life
begets
luxury
and
among
the
parrot
has
become
an
epicure
it
will
not
swallow
its
food
whole
and
its
bill
deserves
study
in
birds
generally
the
upper
mandible
is
more
or
less
joined
to
the
skull
leaving
only
the
lower
jaw
free
to
move
but
in
the
parrot
the
upper
mandible
is
also
hinged
so
that
each
plays
freely
on
the
other
the
upper
as
we
all
know
is
hooked
and
pointed
the
lower
has
a
sharp
edge
the
tongue
is
thick
muscular
and
sensitive
the
whole
makes
a
wonderful
instrument
unique
among
birds
for
feelingly
manipulating
a
dainty
morsel
shelling
peeling
and
slicing
until
nothing
is
left
but
the
sweetest
part
of
the
core
of
all
gourmands
polly
is
the
most
shameless
waster
long
before
land
trees
and
air
had
been
exploited
the
primitive
bird
must
have
discovered
the
harvest
of
the
waters
and
here
the
competition
has
been
very
keen
indeed
yet
the
form
of
bill
most
in
use
is
very
simple
just
a
plain
pair
of
forceps
long
and
like
scissors
this
is
evidently
hard
to
beat
for
birds
of
many
sorts
use
it
handling
it
variously
the
kingfisher
plumps
bodily
down
on
the
minnow
from
an
overhanging
perch
the
solan
goose
soaring
plunges
from
a
pernicious
height
the
heron
high
on
its
stilts
darts
out
a
long
and
serpentine
neck
the
diver
with
similar
beak
and
neck
but
different
legs
pursues
the
fleeing
shoals
under
water
to
the
swift
and
slippery
fish
all
are
alike
terrible
in
their
certainty
there
are
however
other
varieties
of
the
fishing
bill
some
have
a
hook
at
the
point
as
that
of
the
cormorant
and
some
are
straight
at
the
top
but
curved
on
the
under
side
this
last
form
is
handy
for
storks
which
do
not
pluck
fish
out
of
water
so
much
but
scoop
up
frogs
crabs
and
reptiles
from
the
ground
the
ridiculous
bill
of
the
puffin
or
is
an
eccentricity
there
may
be
some
idea
in
it
but
i
suspect
it
is
an
effect
of
vanity
merely
being
coloured
blue
yellow
and
red
and
quite
in
keeping
with
the
other
absurdities
of
the
wearer
apart
from
all
these
and
by
itself
stands
a
princely
fisher
whose
bill
is
no
modification
but
an
original
invention
and
a
marvellous
one
larger
than
a
swan
and
gluttonous
withal
the
pelican
can
not
live
on
single
fishes
it
has
given
up
angling
altogether
and
taken
to
netting
and
the
way
in
which
the
net
has
been
constructed
out
of
the
pair
of
forceps
provided
in
the
original
plan
of
its
construction
is
as
well
worth
your
examining
as
anything
i
know
it
is
a
foot
in
length
the
upper
jaw
is
flat
and
broad
while
the
lower
consists
of
two
thin
elastic
bones
joined
at
the
point
a
mere
ring
to
carry
the
curious
yellow
bag
that
hangs
from
it
in
pictures
this
is
represented
as
a
creel
in
which
the
kind
pelican
carries
home
the
children
breakfast
you
are
allowed
to
see
the
tail
of
a
big
fish
hanging
out
but
it
is
not
a
creel
it
is
a
net
the
great
birds
marshalled
in
line
on
some
broad
lake
or
marsh
and
beating
the
water
with
their
wings
drive
the
fish
before
them
until
they
have
got
a
dense
crowd
huddled
in
panic
and
confusion
between
them
and
the
shore
now
watch
them
narrowly
as
each
monstrous
bill
opens
the
thin
bones
of
the
lower
jaw
stretch
sideways
to
the
breadth
of
a
span
by
some
curious
mechanism
not
described
in
the
books
and
at
the
same
time
the
shrunken
bag
expands
into
a
deep
capacious
net
simultaneously
the
whole
instrument
is
plunged
into
the
struggling
silvery
mass
and
comes
up
full
the
side
bones
instantly
contract
again
and
the
upper
jaw
is
clapped
on
them
like
a
lid
no
wonder
the
fishermen
of
the
east
detest
the
pelican
illustration
here
the
competition
has
been
very
keen
indeed
illustration
as
wonderful
as
the
pelican
but
how
opposite
in
the
same
marsh
perhaps
standing
with
unequalled
grace
upon
the
longest
legs
known
in
this
world
is
a
troop
of
giant
birds
as
wonderful
as
the
pelican
but
how
opposite
the
beautiful
flamingo
is
a
bird
of
feeble
intellect
delicate
appetite
and
genteel
tastes
it
can
not
eat
fish
for
its
slender
throat
would
scarcely
admit
a
pea
besides
the
idea
of
catching
anything
or
even
picking
up
food
from
the
ground
does
not
occur
to
its
simple
mind
its
diet
consists
of
certain
small
crustaceans
classed
by
naturalists
with
which
abound
in
brackish
water
and
it
has
an
instrument
for
taking
these
which
it
knows
how
to
use
i
kept
flamingos
once
and
after
trying
many
things
in
vain
offered
them
bran
or
boiled
rice
floating
in
water
then
they
dined
and
i
learned
the
construction
and
working
of
the
most
marvellous
of
all
bills
the
lower
jaw
is
deep
and
hollow
and
its
upper
edges
turn
in
to
meet
each
other
so
that
you
may
fairly
describe
it
as
a
pipe
with
a
narrow
slit
along
the
upper
side
in
this
pipe
lies
the
tongue
and
it
can
not
get
out
for
it
is
wider
than
the
slit
but
it
can
be
pressed
against
the
top
to
close
the
slit
and
then
the
lower
jaw
becomes
an
actual
pipe
the
root
of
the
tongue
is
furnished
on
both
sides
with
a
loose
fringe
which
we
will
call
the
first
strainer
the
upper
jaw
is
thin
and
flat
and
rests
on
the
lower
like
a
lid
and
it
is
beautifully
fringed
along
both
sides
with
small
leathery
points
close
set
like
the
teeth
of
a
very
fine
saw
this
is
the
second
strainer
to
work
the
machine
you
dip
the
point
into
dirty
water
full
of
draw
back
the
tip
of
the
tongue
a
little
and
suck
in
water
till
the
lower
jaw
the
pipe
is
full
then
close
the
point
again
with
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
force
the
water
out
it
can
only
get
out
by
passing
through
the
first
strainers
at
the
root
of
the
tongue
then
over
the
palate
and
so
through
the
second
strainers
at
the
sides
of
the
bill
and
all
the
solid
matter
it
contained
will
remain
in
the
mouth
the
sucking
in
and
squirting
out
of
the
water
is
managed
by
the
cheeks
or
rather
by
the
cheek
for
a
flamingo
has
only
one
cheek
and
that
is
situated
under
the
chin
when
the
bird
is
feeding
you
will
see
this
throbbing
faster
than
the
eye
can
follow
it
while
water
squirts
from
the
sides
of
the
mouth
in
a
continuous
stream
i
should
have
said
that
the
whole
bill
is
sharply
bent
downwards
at
the
middle
the
advantage
of
this
is
that
when
the
bird
lets
down
its
head
into
the
water
like
a
bucket
into
a
well
the
point
of
the
bill
does
not
stick
in
the
mud
but
lies
flat
on
it
upside
down
in
conclusion
let
us
not
fail
to
note
whatever
be
our
political
creed
that
while
all
the
birds
pursue
their
respective
industries
there
sit
apart
in
pride
of
place
some
whose
bills
are
not
tools
wherewith
to
work
but
weapons
wherewith
to
slay
and
these
take
tribute
of
the
rest
not
with
their
consent
but
of
right
iii
tails
the
secrets
of
nature
often
play
like
an
iridescence
on
the
surface
and
escape
the
eye
of
her
worshipper
because
it
is
stopped
with
a
microscope
there
are
mysteries
all
about
us
as
omnipresent
as
the
movement
of
the
air
that
lifts
the
smoke
and
stirs
the
leaves
which
i
can
not
find
that
any
philosopher
has
looked
into
often
and
deeply
have
i
been
impressed
with
this
for
example
there
is
scarcely
in
this
world
a
commoner
or
a
humbler
thing
than
a
tail
yet
how
multifarious
is
it
in
aspect
in
construction
and
in
function
a
hundred
different
things
and
yet
one
some
are
of
feathers
and
some
of
hair
and
some
bare
and
skinny
some
are
long
and
some
are
short
some
stick
up
and
some
hang
down
some
wag
for
ever
and
some
are
still
the
uses
that
they
serve
can
not
be
numbered
but
one
name
covers
them
all
in
the
course
of
evolution
they
came
in
with
the
fishes
and
went
out
with
man
what
was
their
purpose
and
mission
what
place
have
they
filled
in
the
scheme
of
things
in
short
what
is
the
true
inwardness
of
a
tail
if
we
try
to
commence
as
scientific
method
requires
with
a
definition
we
stumble
on
a
key
at
the
very
threshold
which
opens
the
door
for
there
is
no
definition
of
a
tail
it
is
not
in
its
nature
anything
at
all
when
an
animal
are
fitted
on
to
its
backbone
at
the
proper
distance
from
the
if
any
of
the
backbone
remains
over
we
call
it
a
tail
but
it
has
no
purpose
it
is
a
mere
surplus
which
a
tailor
the
pun
is
unavoidable
would
have
trimmed
off
and
lo
in
this
very
negativeness
lies
the
whole
secret
of
the
multifarious
positiveness
of
tails
for
the
absence
of
special
purpose
is
the
chance
of
general
usefulness
the
ear
must
fulfil
its
purpose
or
fail
entirely
for
it
can
do
nothing
else
eyes
nose
and
mouth
hands
and
feet
all
have
their
duties
the
tail
is
the
unemployed
and
if
we
allow
that
life
has
had
any
hand
in
the
shaping
of
its
own
destiny
then
the
ingenuity
of
the
devices
for
turning
the
useless
member
to
account
affords
one
of
the
most
exhilarating
subjects
of
contemplation
in
the
whole
panorama
of
nature
the
fishes
fitted
it
up
at
once
as
a
with
results
so
satisfactory
that
the
whale
and
the
porpoise
coming
long
after
adopted
the
invention
and
be
it
noted
that
these
last
and
their
kin
are
now
the
only
mammals
in
the
world
the
whole
tribe
of
such
as
seals
and
walruses
and
dugongs
are
only
coasters
among
those
beasts
that
would
live
on
the
dry
land
the
primitive
kangaroo
could
think
of
nothing
better
to
do
with
his
tail
than
to
make
a
stool
of
it
it
was
a
simple
thought
but
a
happy
one
sitting
up
like
a
gentleman
he
has
his
hands
free
to
scratch
his
ribs
or
twitch
his
moustache
and
when
he
goes
he
needs
not
to
put
them
to
the
ground
for
his
great
tail
so
nearly
equals
the
weight
of
his
body
that
one
pair
of
legs
keeps
the
balance
even
and
so
the
kangaroo
almost
the
lowest
of
beasts
comes
closer
to
man
in
his
postures
than
any
other
the
squirrel
also
sits
up
and
uses
his
forepaws
for
hands
but
the
squirrel
is
a
sybarite
who
lies
abed
in
cold
weather
and
it
is
every
way
characteristic
of
him
that
he
has
sent
his
tail
to
the
furrier
and
had
it
done
up
into
a
boa
or
comforter
at
once
warm
and
becoming
see
too
how
daintily
he
lifts
it
over
his
back
to
keep
it
clean
the
rat
is
a
near
relation
of
the
squirrel
zoologically
but
personally
he
is
a
and
you
may
know
that
by
one
look
at
the
tail
which
he
drags
after
him
like
a
dirty
rope
others
of
the
same
family
cleaner
though
not
more
ingenious
like
the
have
simply
dispensed
with
the
encumbrance
but
the
rabbit
has
kept
enough
to
make
a
white
cockade
which
it
hoists
when
bolting
from
danger
this
is
for
the
guidance
of
the
youngsters
nearly
every
kind
of
deer
and
antelope
carries
the
same
signal
with
which
when
fleeing
through
dusky
woods
the
leader
shows
the
way
to
the
herd
and
the
doe
to
her
fawn
but
of
beasts
that
graze
and
browse
a
large
number
have
turned
their
tails
rather
to
a
use
which
throws
a
pathetic
light
on
misery
of
which
we
have
little
experience
we
do
indeed
growl
at
the
gnats
of
a
summer
evening
and
think
ourselves
very
how
little
do
we
know
or
think
of
the
unintermitted
and
unabated
torment
that
the
most
harmless
classes
of
beasts
suffer
from
the
bands
of
beggars
which
follow
them
night
and
day
demanding
blood
and
will
take
no
refusal
driven
from
the
brow
they
settle
on
the
neck
shaken
from
the
neck
they
dive
between
the
legs
and
but
for
that
whisk
at
the
end
of
the
tail
they
would
found
a
permanent
colony
on
the
flanks
and
defy
ejection
like
the
raiders
of
vatersay
darwin
argues
that
the
may
have
materially
helped
to
secure
the
survival
of
those
species
of
beasts
that
possessed
it
and
no
doubt
he
is
right
the
subject
is
interminable
but
we
must
give
a
passing
glance
to
some
quixotic
tails
the
opossum
scampers
up
a
tree
carrying
all
her
numerous
family
on
her
back
and
they
do
not
fall
off
because
each
infant
is
securely
moored
by
its
own
tail
to
the
uplifted
tail
of
its
mother
the
opossum
is
a
very
primitive
beast
and
so
early
and
useful
an
invention
should
one
would
think
have
been
spread
widely
in
after
time
but
there
appears
to
be
some
difficulty
in
developing
muscles
at
the
thin
end
of
a
long
tail
for
the
animals
that
have
turned
it
into
a
grasping
organ
are
few
and
are
widely
scattered
examples
are
the
chameleon
among
lizards
our
own
little
harvest
mouse
and
above
all
the
american
monkeys
to
a
howler
or
its
long
tail
is
a
swing
and
a
trapeze
in
its
forest
gymnasium
humboldt
saw
he
says
it
a
cluster
of
them
all
hanging
from
a
tree
by
one
tail
which
proceeded
from
a
sandow
in
the
middle
i
should
like
to
see
that
too
it
is
worth
noting
by
the
way
that
no
monkey
has
attained
to
this
application
of
its
tail
then
there
is
the
beaver
whose
tail
i
am
convinced
is
a
trowel
i
know
of
no
naturalist
who
has
mentioned
this
but
such
negative
evidence
is
of
little
weight
the
beaver
as
everybody
knows
is
a
builder
who
cuts
down
trees
and
piles
log
upon
log
until
he
has
raised
a
solid
domed
cabin
from
seven
to
twenty
feet
in
diameter
which
he
then
plasters
over
with
clay
and
straw
if
he
does
not
turn
round
and
beat
the
work
smooth
with
his
tail
then
i
require
to
know
for
what
purpose
he
carries
that
broad
heavy
and
hard
tool
behind
him
how
few
even
among
lovers
of
nature
know
why
a
frog
has
no
tail
the
simply
that
it
used
that
organ
up
when
it
was
in
want
in
early
life
as
a
jolly
tadpole
it
had
a
flourishing
tail
to
swim
with
and
gills
for
breathing
water
and
an
infantile
mouth
for
taking
vegetable
nourishment
but
when
it
began
to
draw
near
to
frog
estate
serious
changes
were
required
in
its
structure
to
fit
it
for
the
life
of
a
land
animal
four
tiny
legs
appeared
from
under
its
skin
the
gills
gave
place
to
lungs
and
the
infant
lips
to
a
great
gaping
mouth
now
during
this
temporary
alteration
of
the
premises
all
business
was
of
necessity
stopped
the
could
neither
sup
like
an
infant
nor
eat
like
a
man
in
this
extremity
it
fed
on
its
own
tail
absorbed
it
as
a
camel
is
said
to
absorb
its
hump
when
travelling
in
the
foodless
desert
and
so
it
entered
on
its
new
life
without
one
aeronautics
have
changed
the
whole
perspective
of
life
for
birds
as
they
may
for
us
shortly
so
it
is
no
surprise
to
find
that
birds
have
almost
with
one
consent
converted
their
tails
into
a
commonplace
bird
like
a
sparrow
scarcely
requires
this
except
as
a
brake
when
in
the
act
of
alighting
but
to
those
birds
with
which
flight
is
an
art
and
an
accomplishment
an
expansive
forked
or
rounded
tail
there
are
two
patents
is
indispensable
we
have
shot
almost
all
the
birds
of
this
sort
in
our
own
country
and
must
travel
if
we
would
enjoy
that
enchanting
sight
a
pair
of
eagles
or
a
party
of
kites
gone
aloft
for
a
sail
when
the
wind
is
rising
like
skaters
to
a
pond
when
the
ice
is
bearing
for
an
hour
on
end
in
restful
ease
or
swift
joy
they
trace
circles
and
spirals
against
the
dark
now
rising
now
falling
turning
and
reversing
but
never
once
flapping
their
widespread
pinions
how
is
it
done
how
does
the
sail
watch
and
you
will
see
when
the
wind
is
behind
each
stiff
quill
at
the
end
of
the
wing
stands
out
by
itself
and
is
caught
and
driven
by
the
blast
but
as
the
bird
turns
round
to
face
the
gale
they
all
close
up
and
form
a
continuous
mainsail
and
all
the
while
the
expanded
tail
is
in
play
dipping
first
at
one
side
and
then
at
the
other
and
turning
the
trim
craft
with
easy
grace
as
the
governor
listeth
illustration
there
are
some
eccentrics
such
as
jenny
wren
which
have
despised
their
tails
besides
ground
birds
like
the
quail
there
are
some
eccentrics
such
as
jenny
wren
which
have
despised
their
tails
and
there
are
specialists
also
which
require
them
for
other
purposes
than
flying
the
tail
is
quite
useless
as
a
rudder
for
he
is
a
woodman
and
has
altered
and
adapted
it
for
a
portable
stool
to
rest
against
as
he
plies
his
axe
but
that
man
must
be
very
blind
to
the
place
which
birds
have
taken
in
the
progress
of
civilisation
who
can
suppose
it
possible
that
they
should
think
only
of
utility
in
such
a
question
as
the
disposal
of
their
tails
it
is
a
common
notion
among
those
who
have
acquired
some
smattering
of
the
theory
of
evolution
that
fishes
developed
into
reptiles
reptiles
into
birds
and
birds
into
beasts
but
this
is
as
wrong
as
it
could
be
whatever
the
genealogy
of
the
beasts
may
be
they
certainly
were
not
evolved
from
birds
and
are
in
many
respects
not
above
them
but
below
them
these
are
two
independent
branches
of
the
tree
of
living
forms
as
the
greeks
and
romans
were
branches
of
the
stock
of
japheth
the
beasts
may
stand
for
the
conquering
romans
if
you
like
but
the
birds
are
the
greeks
and
have
advanced
far
beyond
them
in
all
emotional
and
artistic
sensibility
they
worship
in
the
temple
of
music
and
beauty
and
like
ourselves
they
have
found
no
subject
so
worthy
of
the
highest
efforts
of
art
as
their
own
dress
but
the
clothing
of
the
body
must
conform
more
or
less
to
the
figure
and
so
for
a
field
in
which
invention
and
fancy
may
sport
untrammelled
a
lady
turns
to
her
hat
and
a
bird
to
its
tail
and
by
both
with
equal
heroism
every
consideration
of
mere
comfort
convenience
health
or
safety
is
swept
aside
in
obedience
to
the
higher
aim
is
this
only
a
flippant
jocularity
or
is
there
here
in
very
truth
some
profound
law
of
the
mind
revealing
itself
in
spheres
seemingly
so
disconnected
look
at
a
peacock
its
train
by
the
way
is
a
false
tail
like
the
chignon
of
twenty
years
ago
or
the
fringe
of
the
present
day
the
true
tail
is
under
it
and
serves
no
purpose
but
to
support
it
now
the
peacock
lives
on
the
ground
among
scrub
and
brushwood
haunted
by
jackals
and
wild
cats
they
like
soldiers
in
khaki
reconnoitre
him
in
a
uniform
expressly
designed
to
elude
the
eye
but
he
flaunts
a
flag
resplendent
with
green
and
gold
and
when
his
one
chance
of
life
lies
in
springing
nimbly
from
the
ground
and
committing
himself
to
his
strong
wings
he
must
lift
and
carry
this
ponderous
paraphernalia
with
him
and
the
terrible
bonelli
eagle
is
soaring
above
but
all
is
risked
proudly
for
the
sake
of
the
morning
hour
in
the
glade
where
the
ladies
assemble
and
the
peacock
is
only
one
of
many
not
to
mention
the
lyre
bird
the
argus
pheasant
the
bird
of
paradise
and
other
splendid
examples
there
are
common
which
point
the
moral
and
adorn
the
tail
as
emphatically
if
the
tail
is
a
rudder
where
should
you
look
to
find
it
in
its
most
simple
and
efficient
form
but
among
the
flycatchers
which
make
their
living
by
aerial
acrobatics
after
flies
yet
this
family
seems
to
be
peculiarly
prone
to
the
vanity
of
a
stylish
tail
the
paradise
flycatcher
flutters
two
streamers
a
foot
long
like
white
ribbons
behind
it
the
fantail
could
hide
behind
its
own
fan
the
has
the
two
central
feathers
prolonged
and
pointed
the
drongos
which
are
flycatchers
in
habit
wear
their
tails
very
long
and
deeply
forked
and
one
of
them
the
drongo
has
the
two
side
feathers
extended
beyond
the
rest
for
nearly
a
foot
and
as
thin
as
wires
expanding
into
a
blade
at
the
ends
i
have
seen
nothing
in
ladies
hats
more
preposterous
it
is
vain
to
object
that
there
can
be
no
proper
comparison
between
tails
and
hats
because
the
woman
chooses
her
own
hat
while
the
bird
has
to
wear
what
nature
has
given
it
i
know
that
but
the
contention
is
utterly
superficial
what
choice
has
a
woman
as
to
the
style
of
her
hat
fashion
prescribes
for
her
and
nature
for
the
birds
that
is
all
the
difference
no
doubt
she
acquiesces
when
theoretically
she
might
rebel
the
bird
can
not
rebel
but
does
it
not
acquiesce
does
a
lyre
bird
submit
to
its
tail
wear
it
under
protest
so
to
speak
believe
me
every
bird
that
has
an
aesthetic
tail
knows
the
fact
and
tries
to
live
up
to
it
we
may
push
the
argument
even
further
for
the
motmot
of
brazil
is
not
content
with
a
tail
but
actually
strips
the
web
off
the
two
long
side
feathers
with
its
own
beak
except
a
little
patch
at
the
end
so
as
to
get
the
pattern
which
nature
if
one
must
use
the
phrase
gave
to
the
drongo
a
specimen
is
exhibited
in
the
hall
of
the
south
kensington
museum
illustration
a
blackbird
and
a
starling
the
one
lifts
its
skirts
while
the
other
wears
a
walking
dress
in
this
connection
i
may
also
say
that
the
shape
or
colour
of
a
tail
is
not
everything
an
observant
eye
may
find
much
to
note
in
the
wearing
of
them
there
is
a
stylish
way
of
carrying
a
tail
and
a
slovenly
way
and
there
are
coquettish
arts
for
the
display
of
recherche
tails
a
blackbird
and
a
starling
are
both
tidy
birds
and
both
walk
much
on
the
ground
but
the
one
lifts
its
skirts
while
the
other
more
practical
and
less
fashionable
wears
a
walking
dress
and
saves
itself
trouble
this
line
of
observation
leads
to
a
higher
and
reveals
the
most
important
purpose
that
tails
have
served
in
the
economy
of
beast
bird
and
reptile
and
perhaps
even
fish
before
the
godlike
countenance
of
man
appeared
on
the
earth
with
its
contractile
forehead
and
erectile
eyebrows
the
answering
light
of
the
eye
the
expansive
nostrils
and
subtilely
mobile
lips
before
that
the
tail
was
the
prime
vehicle
of
emotion
and
of
passion
it
is
a
great
truth
too
often
buried
in
these
days
under
rubbish
of
materialistic
theories
that
some
way
of
is
a
supreme
necessity
of
all
sentient
life
from
the
hot
centre
of
thought
and
feeling
the
currents
rush
along
the
nervous
ways
and
pervade
the
whole
frame
seeking
an
outlet
but
many
passages
are
barred
by
duty
or
fear
or
eager
purpose
a
strong
gust
of
passion
may
burst
all
barriers
and
force
its
way
out
at
every
point
but
gentle
currents
flow
along
the
lines
of
least
resistance
and
find
the
idle
tail
i
do
not
know
a
better
illustration
of
this
than
a
cat
watching
a
mouse
the
ears
are
pricked
forward
the
eyes
are
fixed
on
the
unsuspecting
victim
every
muscle
of
the
legs
is
tense
like
a
bent
bow
ready
to
speed
the
arrow
on
its
way
but
see
the
excitement
with
which
the
whole
body
is
charged
can
not
be
wholly
restrained
and
oozes
out
at
the
point
of
the
tail
illustration
at
the
sight
of
a
rival
the
dog
holds
its
tail
up
stiffly
every
emotion
and
passion
takes
this
course
the
happy
kid
wags
its
tail
as
it
runs
to
its
mother
the
donkey
when
it
has
executed
a
successful
bray
and
the
dog
when
it
sees
its
master
at
the
sight
of
a
rival
the
dog
holds
its
tail
up
stiffly
unless
indeed
the
rival
is
a
bigger
dog
than
itself
in
which
case
the
index
goes
down
quickly
between
the
legs
an
elated
horse
elevates
its
tail
and
so
does
a
duck
in
the
same
mood
a
lizard
preparing
to
fight
another
lizard
swinges
the
scaly
horror
of
his
folded
tail
and
the
raging
lion
of
fiction
lashes
its
sides
with
the
same
nervous
instrument
it
would
be
tedious
to
dwell
on
the
pretty
part
which
the
tail
plays
in
the
courtships
of
sparrows
and
pigeons
or
on
the
sprightly
attitudes
by
which
birds
of
all
sorts
let
off
their
spirits
when
shower
and
sunshine
have
overfilled
their
hearts
with
gladness
but
birds
twitch
their
tails
constantly
without
meaning
anything
by
it
the
ceaseless
wagging
of
a
wagtail
is
a
mere
habit
of
cheerfulness
like
the
twirling
of
her
thumbs
by
an
idle
scotswoman
the
long
tail
is
there
and
something
must
be
done
with
it
look
at
the
embarrassment
which
a
nervous
young
man
shows
about
the
disposal
of
his
hands
how
he
thrusts
them
into
his
trouser
pockets
hangs
them
by
their
thumbs
from
the
of
his
waistcoat
or
gives
them
a
to
play
with
i
like
to
imagine
what
such
a
fellow
would
do
with
a
long
tail
if
he
had
it
how
he
would
wind
it
round
each
leg
in
turn
rub
up
his
back
hair
and
describe
figures
on
the
floor
but
no
animal
so
as
man
could
bear
up
long
under
the
nervous
strain
of
having
to
think
continually
of
its
tail
it
would
die
young
and
the
race
would
become
extinct
perhaps
it
did
a
final
word
on
the
conclusion
of
the
whole
matter
for
these
reflections
have
a
moral
as
habit
becomes
character
so
expression
hardens
into
feature
the
tail
of
a
sheep
grows
downwards
but
that
of
a
goat
upwards
and
this
is
the
only
infallible
outward
mark
of
distinction
between
the
two
animals
but
it
is
the
permanent
record
of
a
long
history
the
sheep
was
never
anything
but
sheepish
the
goat
and
its
forefathers
were
pert
as
kids
and
insolent
when
their
beards
grew
it
is
useless
to
inquire
why
insolence
should
express
itself
by
an
upturned
tail
until
someone
can
advance
a
reason
why
it
should
express
itself
in
another
way
for
proof
of
the
fact
you
need
go
no
farther
than
your
own
dogs
the
ancestral
wolf
or
jackal
hunting
and
fighting
fearing
and
hoping
showed
every
changing
mood
by
the
pose
of
its
tail
but
a
change
came
when
it
acquired
an
assured
position
of
security
and
importance
as
the
chosen
companion
of
man
so
dreaded
by
all
its
kith
and
kin
the
tail
went
up
at
once
and
stayed
there
when
it
could
go
no
higher
it
curled
over
but
promotion
breeds
conceit
only
in
base
natures
the
greyhound
is
a
gentleman
respectful
and
and
it
shows
that
by
the
very
carriage
of
its
tail
only
a
snob
at
heart
petted
and
pampered
for
many
generations
could
have
produced
that
perfect
incarnation
of
smug
the
pug
let
us
take
the
lesson
home
the
thoughts
on
which
we
let
our
minds
dwell
and
the
sentiments
that
we
harbour
in
our
hearts
are
the
chisels
with
which
we
are
carving
out
our
faces
and
those
of
our
children
children
iv
noses
some
may
think
that
i
have
chosen
a
trivial
subject
and
they
will
look
for
frivolous
treatment
of
it
i
can
only
hope
that
they
will
be
disappointed
there
is
nothing
that
the
progress
of
science
has
taught
us
more
emphatically
than
this
that
we
must
call
nothing
insignificant
seemingly
trivial
pursuits
have
led
to
discoveries
which
have
benefited
all
mankind
and
priceless
truths
have
been
dug
out
of
the
most
unpromising
mines
i
am
not
insinuating
that
anyone
nose
is
an
unpromising
mine
but
i
say
that
i
am
persuaded
there
is
wisdom
hidden
in
that
organ
for
him
who
will
observingly
distil
it
out
illustration
a
shrew
can
do
it
but
not
a
man
it
possesses
a
peculiar
and
mystical
significance
not
shared
by
any
other
feature
this
is
abundantly
proved
by
common
speech
which
is
one
of
the
most
trustworthy
of
all
kinds
of
evidence
for
example
we
speak
of
a
person
turning
up
his
nose
at
a
good
offer
the
phrase
is
absurd
for
the
power
of
turning
up
his
nose
is
one
which
no
human
being
ever
possessed
a
shrew
can
do
it
but
not
a
man
yet
the
meaning
of
the
saying
needs
no
interpretation
akin
to
it
is
the
classical
phrase
suspendere
what
horace
means
scarcely
requires
explanation
but
no
commentator
has
successfully
explained
it
these
expressions
well
illustrate
the
mystery
that
enshrouds
our
most
salient
feature
they
show
that
while
everybody
can
see
that
disdain
is
expressed
through
the
nose
nobody
can
define
how
it
is
done
then
there
is
that
curious
expression
put
his
nose
out
of
joint
which
is
quite
inexplicable
the
nose
being
destitute
of
joint
there
are
many
other
phrases
and
also
gestures
which
point
in
the
same
direction
but
need
not
be
cited
being
for
the
most
part
vulgar
allusions
to
the
nose
have
a
tendency
to
be
vulgar
which
is
another
mystery
inciting
us
to
investigate
it
so
let
us
proceed
the
first
thing
required
by
the
principles
of
scientific
precedure
is
a
definition
what
is
a
nose
but
this
proves
to
be
a
much
more
difficult
question
than
anyone
would
suspect
before
he
tried
to
answer
it
the
individual
human
nose
we
can
recognise
describe
or
sketch
more
easily
than
any
other
feature
but
try
to
define
the
thing
in
nature
and
it
is
a
most
elusive
phenomenon
when
we
speak
of
a
man
being
led
by
the
nose
we
imply
that
it
is
a
part
of
him
which
is
prominent
and
situated
in
front
when
we
speak
of
keeping
one
nose
above
water
we
refer
to
it
as
the
breathing
orifice
but
when
we
say
that
this
or
that
offends
our
nose
we
are
regarding
it
as
the
seat
of
the
sense
of
smell
i
believe
that
all
these
three
ideas
must
be
included
in
any
definition
it
should
follow
that
insects
which
breathe
through
holes
in
their
sides
can
not
have
noses
and
this
is
the
truth
fishes
too
though
they
may
have
snouts
have
not
noses
because
they
breathe
by
gills
in
truth
it
seems
that
the
nose
was
a
very
late
and
high
acquisition
almost
the
finishing
touch
of
the
perfected
animal
form
and
incidentally
this
leads
us
to
notice
what
a
great
step
was
taken
in
evolution
when
the
breathing
holes
were
brought
up
to
the
region
of
the
mouth
for
the
sense
of
taste
is
necessarily
situated
in
the
mouth
and
the
sense
of
smell
is
in
close
alliance
with
it
the
mouth
tastes
food
dissolved
in
the
saliva
during
the
process
of
mastication
and
the
primary
use
of
the
sense
of
smell
is
to
detect
and
analyse
beforehand
the
small
particles
given
off
by
food
and
floating
in
the
atmosphere
a
good
many
years
ago
when
the
late
sally
chimpanzee
was
the
darling
of
the
zoological
gardens
in
regent
park
i
watched
her
eating
dates
she
was
an
epicure
and
always
peeled
each
date
delicately
with
her
preposterous
lips
before
eating
it
and
during
the
process
she
would
apply
the
date
to
her
nose
every
second
to
test
its
quality
or
enjoy
its
aroma
the
action
was
indescribably
comical
but
what
would
it
have
been
if
her
nostrils
had
been
situated
among
her
ribs
imagine
a
mantis
for
example
as
he
chews
up
a
fly
lifting
one
of
his
wings
and
applying
it
to
his
flanks
to
see
if
it
smells
gamey
that
is
where
some
naturalists
believe
that
the
sense
of
smell
is
situated
in
insects
others
however
think
with
reason
that
it
is
in
the
antennae
or
mouth
nobody
knows
the
senses
of
the
lower
animals
seem
to
be
stuck
about
all
parts
of
the
body
but
even
if
the
sense
of
smell
is
at
the
mouth
how
limited
must
its
usefulness
be
when
it
can
only
deal
with
substances
that
are
held
to
it
a
new
era
dawned
when
the
passages
by
which
the
breath
of
life
unceasingly
comes
and
goes
were
transferred
to
the
region
of
the
mouth
also
the
nerves
of
smell
quickly
spread
themselves
over
the
lining
membrane
of
those
passages
and
became
warders
of
the
gate
challenging
every
waft
of
air
that
entered
the
body
and
examining
what
it
carried
thenceforth
this
region
comprising
the
mouth
nostrils
and
surrounding
parts
holds
a
new
and
high
place
in
the
economy
of
the
body
for
the
headquarters
of
the
intelligence
department
are
located
there
and
all
the
faculties
of
the
brain
converge
on
that
point
of
course
the
eyes
and
ears
claim
a
share
but
they
are
not
far
off
now
it
is
being
recognised
more
and
more
clearly
by
medical
and
physiological
science
that
when
the
mind
is
much
directed
to
any
part
of
the
body
it
exercises
an
influence
in
some
way
not
understood
on
the
flow
of
blood
to
that
part
to
a
degree
which
may
seriously
affect
its
functions
and
even
its
growth
when
a
person
is
suffering
from
any
nervous
affection
from
heart
disease
or
even
from
weakness
of
the
eyes
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
keep
him
from
knowing
it
if
possible
for
if
he
knows
it
he
will
think
about
it
and
that
will
inevitably
aggravate
it
this
principle
is
well
recognised
in
systems
of
physical
culture
and
surely
it
is
impossible
that
so
much
intelligence
should
pass
through
that
one
sensitive
region
of
the
body
which
we
are
considering
without
affecting
its
growth
and
structure
every
muscle
in
it
becomes
quick
to
respond
to
various
sensations
in
different
ways
till
the
very
recollection
of
those
sensations
will
excite
the
same
response
nay
we
may
go
further
the
mental
emotions
excited
by
those
sensations
will
be
expressed
in
the
same
way
for
example
the
sense
of
smell
is
peculiarly
effective
in
exciting
disgust
anything
which
does
violence
to
the
sense
of
hearing
exasperates
but
does
not
disgust
if
a
man
practises
the
accordion
all
day
in
the
next
room
you
do
not
loathe
him
you
only
want
to
kill
him
but
anything
that
stinks
excites
pure
disgust
here
you
have
the
key
to
the
fact
that
disgust
and
all
feelings
akin
to
it
disdain
contempt
and
scorn
express
themselves
through
the
nose
darwin
says
that
when
we
think
of
anything
base
or
vile
in
a
character
the
expression
of
the
face
is
the
same
as
if
we
smelled
a
bad
smell
this
is
an
example
of
the
temporary
expression
of
a
passing
emotion
and
there
are
many
others
like
it
but
each
of
us
has
his
prevailing
and
dominant
emotions
which
constitute
the
habitual
attitude
of
his
mind
and
by
the
habitual
indulgence
of
any
emotion
the
features
will
become
habituated
to
the
expression
of
it
and
so
the
set
of
our
features
comes
at
last
to
express
our
prevailing
and
dominant
emotions
in
other
words
our
illustration
the
nostrils
of
the
apteryx
are
at
the
tip
of
its
beak
but
let
us
return
to
the
evolution
of
the
nose
in
these
days
of
universal
nature
study
nobody
need
be
told
that
the
practice
of
breathing
through
the
nostrils
was
introduced
by
the
amphibians
and
reptiles
the
former
frogs
and
toads
take
to
it
only
when
they
come
of
age
but
lizards
snakes
and
all
other
reptiles
do
it
from
infancy
but
the
nose
is
not
yet
that
is
something
too
delicate
to
come
out
of
a
snout
covered
with
hard
scales
birds
too
by
having
their
mouth
parts
encased
in
a
horny
bill
seem
to
be
debarred
from
wearing
noses
and
yet
there
is
one
primeval
fowl
most
ancient
of
all
the
feathered
families
which
has
come
near
it
i
mean
the
apteryx
that
eccentric
wingless
recluse
which
hides
itself
in
the
scrub
jungles
of
new
zealand
its
nostrils
unlike
those
of
every
other
bird
are
at
the
tip
of
its
beak
which
is
swollen
and
sensitive
and
buller
says
that
as
it
wanders
about
in
the
night
it
makes
a
continual
sniffing
and
softly
taps
the
walls
of
its
cage
with
the
point
of
its
bill
but
the
apteryx
is
one
of
those
odd
geniuses
which
come
into
the
world
too
soon
and
perish
ineffectual
its
kindred
are
all
extinct
and
so
will
it
be
ere
long
illustration
a
bold
attempt
to
grow
in
the
case
of
a
tapir
when
we
come
to
the
beasts
we
find
the
right
conditions
at
last
for
the
growth
of
the
nose
take
the
horse
for
an
example
of
the
average
beast
without
idiosyncrasy
its
profile
is
nearly
a
straight
line
from
the
crown
to
the
nostrils
beyond
which
it
slopes
downwards
to
the
lips
the
skin
of
this
part
is
soft
and
smooth
without
hair
and
the
horse
dearly
loves
to
have
it
fondled
the
sense
of
touch
is
evidently
uppermost
at
this
stage
there
was
what
to
the
eye
of
fancy
looks
like
a
bold
attempt
to
grow
a
nose
in
the
case
of
a
tapir
but
it
miscarried
these
hoofed
beasts
are
all
very
hard
up
for
something
in
the
way
of
a
hand
to
bring
their
food
to
their
mouths
the
camel
employs
its
lips
and
the
cow
its
tongue
the
muntjae
or
barking
deer
of
india
has
attained
a
tongue
of
such
length
that
it
uses
it
for
a
handkerchief
to
wipe
its
eyes
so
the
tapir
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
misapply
its
nose
to
the
purpose
of
gathering
fodder
and
the
ultimate
result
was
the
elephant
whose
nose
is
a
wonderful
hand
and
a
bucket
and
other
things
the
pig
being
a
swine
debased
its
nose
in
a
worse
way
making
a
grubbing
tool
of
it
there
has
been
another
attempt
to
misuse
and
pervert
this
part
of
the
face
which
i
scarcely
dare
to
touch
upon
for
it
is
so
utterly
fantastic
and
mystical
that
i
fear
the
charge
of
heresy
if
i
give
words
to
my
thoughts
it
occurs
among
bats
a
tribe
of
obscure
creatures
about
which
common
knowledge
amounts
to
this
that
they
fly
about
after
sunset
are
uncanny
and
fond
of
getting
entangled
in
the
hair
of
ladies
and
should
be
killed
but
there
are
certain
families
of
bats
named
horseshoe
bats
bats
and
vampires
about
which
common
knowledge
is
and
the
knowledge
possessed
by
naturalists
very
little
so
i
will
tell
what
i
know
of
them
they
are
larger
than
common
bats
their
wings
are
broad
soft
and
silent
like
those
of
the
owl
they
sleep
in
caves
tombs
and
ruins
they
do
not
flutter
in
the
open
air
but
swiftly
traverse
gloomy
avenues
and
shady
glades
their
prey
is
not
gnats
and
midges
but
the
droning
beetle
the
death
head
moth
the
cockchafer
croaking
frogs
sleeping
birds
and
the
books
will
tell
you
that
these
bats
are
distinguished
by
complicated
nasal
appendages
consisting
of
foliaceous
skin
processes
around
the
nostrils
which
is
quite
true
and
utterly
futile
it
may
do
for
a
dried
skin
or
a
specimen
in
spirits
of
wine
i
have
had
the
foul
fiend
in
a
cage
and
looked
him
in
the
face
his
whole
countenance
from
lips
to
brow
and
from
cheek
to
cheek
is
covered
and
hidden
by
a
hideous
design
of
spells
and
signs
symbolic
letters
circles
lines
sculptured
in
living
quivering
skin
it
is
a
sight
to
make
the
flesh
creep
the
books
suggest
that
these
foliaceous
appendages
are
the
organs
of
some
special
sense
akin
to
touch
futile
again
there
are
things
in
nature
still
which
prompt
the
naturalist
who
has
not
atrophied
his
inner
eye
and
starved
his
imagination
to
cry
out
science
why
preyest
thou
thus
upon
the
poet
heart
vulture
whose
wings
are
dull
realities
supposing
there
should
be
in
the
unseen
universe
an
evil
spirit
an
imp
of
malice
and
mischief
not
milton
satan
but
the
deil
of
burns
whyles
ranging
like
a
roaring
lion
for
prey
a
holes
an
corners
tryin
whyles
on
the
tempest
flyin
tirlin
the
kirks
whyles
in
the
human
bosom
pryin
and
supposing
him
to
crave
possession
of
a
body
through
which
he
might
get
into
touch
with
this
material
world
and
express
himself
in
outward
forms
and
motions
then
oh
how
fitly
were
this
bat
explained
but
let
us
go
back
to
firm
ground
if
you
compare
a
dog
profile
with
that
of
a
horse
you
will
note
at
once
that
the
nostrils
are
in
advance
of
the
lips
and
have
a
kind
of
portal
to
themselves
this
is
a
distinct
advance
the
sense
of
smell
has
come
to
the
front
and
pushed
aside
the
lower
sense
of
touch
you
will
observe
too
that
with
the
growth
of
the
brain
the
has
elevated
itself
above
the
level
of
the
nose
through
the
cat
to
the
monkeys
the
process
proceeds
the
forehead
advancing
the
jaws
retreating
and
the
nostrils
leaving
the
lips
until
they
finally
settle
in
a
detached
villa
midway
between
the
eyes
and
the
mouth
this
is
the
nose
i
do
not
know
the
use
of
it
i
can
not
fathom
the
meaning
of
it
it
is
a
solemn
mystery
see
the
face
of
an
it
is
a
a
signboard
with
three
distinct
lines
of
writing
on
it
the
eyes
the
nose
and
the
mouth
you
may
not
think
much
of
this
particular
nose
neither
do
i
think
it
is
situated
rather
too
near
the
eyes
and
too
far
from
the
mouth
it
is
a
little
too
small
also
and
wants
style
but
you
must
not
judge
a
first
attempt
too
critically
i
have
seen
human
noses
of
a
pattern
not
unlike
this
but
they
are
not
considered
aristocratic
perhaps
they
indicate
a
reversion
to
the
ancestral
type
illustration
i
have
seen
human
noses
of
a
pattern
not
unlike
this
but
they
are
not
considered
aristocratic
but
the
noses
even
of
monkeys
are
not
all
like
this
in
fact
there
is
a
good
deal
of
variety
and
two
in
particular
have
struck
me
as
quite
remarkable
one
is
that
of
the
monkey
i
think
it
must
have
suggested
sterne
stranger
on
a
mule
who
had
travelled
to
the
promontory
of
noses
and
threw
all
strassburg
into
a
ferment
i
have
often
contemplated
this
nose
in
mute
wonderment
and
longed
to
see
that
monkey
in
life
if
so
be
i
might
arrive
at
some
understanding
of
it
for
the
taxidermist
can
not
rise
above
his
own
level
and
the
man
who
would
mount
would
need
to
be
a
henry
irving
then
there
is
the
monkey
labelled
of
which
there
is
an
expressive
specimen
at
the
south
kensington
museum
who
can
consider
that
nose
seriously
and
continue
to
believe
in
a
recipe
made
up
of
struggle
for
existence
adaptation
to
environment
and
natural
selection
if
i
could
dine
with
that
monkey
ask
it
to
drink
a
glass
of
wine
with
me
offer
it
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
so
on
i
might
come
in
time
to
feel
if
not
to
comprehend
the
import
of
its
nose
illustration
the
monkey
illustration
who
can
consider
that
nose
seriously
but
one
step
further
is
required
for
the
evolution
of
what
we
may
call
the
human
nose
and
that
is
a
solid
foundation
a
ridge
of
bone
connecting
it
with
the
brow
and
separating
the
eyes
from
each
other
i
believe
that
the
completeness
of
this
is
a
fair
index
of
the
comparative
advancement
of
different
races
of
men
in
the
greek
ideal
of
a
perfect
face
the
profile
forms
a
straight
line
from
the
top
of
the
forehead
to
the
tip
of
the
nose
this
is
the
type
of
face
which
painters
have
delighted
to
give
to
the
virgin
mary
and
when
looking
at
their
madonnas
one
can
not
help
wondering
whether
they
forgot
that
mary
was
a
jewess
according
to
the
hebrew
ideal
a
perfect
nose
was
like
the
tower
of
lebanon
which
looketh
toward
damascus
song
of
solomon
vii
but
not
even
the
ruins
of
that
tower
remain
to
help
us
the
romans
no
doubt
accepted
the
ideal
of
the
greeks
aesthetically
but
their
destiny
had
given
them
a
very
different
nose
and
they
ruled
the
world
here
is
the
nose
of
julius
caesar
as
a
coin
has
preserved
it
for
us
i
think
that
the
outline
is
too
straight
for
a
typical
roman
but
the
deep
dip
under
the
brow
and
the
downward
point
are
characteristic
now
compare
the
nose
of
another
race
which
rules
an
empire
greater
than
that
of
the
caesars
here
is
john
bull
as
usually
represents
him
it
belongs
to
the
same
genus
as
that
of
the
roman
the
reason
why
this
should
be
the
nose
of
command
is
not
easy
to
give
with
scientific
precision
for
we
are
dealing
with
the
play
of
very
subtle
influences
so
the
man
without
imagination
will
no
doubt
scoff
but
i
will
take
shelter
under
darwin
dealing
with
the
expression
of
pride
he
says
a
proud
man
exhibits
his
sense
of
superiority
by
holding
his
head
and
body
erect
he
is
haughty
haut
or
high
and
makes
himself
appear
as
large
as
possible
again
the
arrogant
man
looks
down
on
others
and
yet
again
in
some
photographs
of
patients
affected
by
a
monomania
of
pride
sent
me
by
the
head
and
body
were
held
erect
and
the
mouth
firmly
closed
this
latter
action
expressive
of
decision
follows
i
presume
from
the
proud
man
feeling
perfect
in
himself
darwin
says
nothing
about
the
nose
but
i
believe
that
by
physiological
sympathy
it
can
not
but
take
part
in
the
habitual
downward
look
upon
inferior
beings
darwin
goes
on
to
say
that
the
whole
expression
of
pride
stands
in
direct
antithesis
to
that
of
humility
from
which
it
follows
if
my
philosophy
is
sound
that
the
nose
of
uriah
heep
was
turned
upwards
of
course
many
emotions
may
share
in
the
moulding
of
a
nose
and
the
whole
subject
is
too
intricate
and
vast
to
be
treated
briefly
i
have
only
given
a
few
examples
to
illustrate
my
argument
and
my
conclusion
is
that
the
key
to
the
peculiar
significance
and
personal
quality
of
the
nose
is
to
be
found
in
its
the
eyes
and
lips
are
incessantly
in
motion
we
can
twitch
and
wrinkle
the
cheeks
and
forehead
and
muscles
to
move
the
ears
are
there
though
most
men
have
lost
control
of
them
but
the
nose
stands
out
like
some
bold
promontory
on
a
level
coast
or
like
the
sphinx
in
the
egyptian
desert
with
an
ancient
history
no
doubt
and
a
mystery
perhaps
but
without
response
to
any
appeal
and
for
this
very
reason
it
is
an
index
not
to
that
which
is
transient
in
the
man
but
to
that
which
is
permanent
he
may
knit
his
brows
to
seem
thoughtful
and
profound
or
compress
his
lips
to
persuade
his
friends
and
himself
that
he
has
a
strong
will
but
he
can
play
no
trick
with
his
nose
there
it
stands
an
incorruptible
witness
testifying
to
what
he
is
and
not
only
to
what
he
is
but
to
the
rock
whence
he
was
hewn
and
to
the
pit
whence
he
was
digged
for
his
nose
is
a
bequest
from
his
ancestors
an
entailed
estate
which
he
can
not
alienate
v
ears
men
and
women
have
ears
and
so
have
jugs
and
pitchers
in
the
latter
case
they
are
useful
jugs
and
pitchers
are
lifted
by
them
and
what
is
useful
is
fit
and
fitness
is
the
first
condition
of
beauty
but
human
ears
are
put
to
no
use
except
sometimes
when
naughty
little
boys
are
lifted
by
them
in
the
way
of
discipline
and
i
can
see
no
beauty
in
them
it
is
only
because
they
are
so
common
that
we
do
not
notice
how
ridiculous
they
are
in
the
days
of
charles
men
sometimes
had
their
ears
cut
off
for
holding
wrong
opinions
which
would
have
made
them
famous
and
popular
in
these
enlightened
days
but
at
that
time
it
made
all
people
despise
them
so
the
fashion
of
going
without
ears
did
not
spread
among
us
if
it
had
then
how
differently
we
should
all
think
of
the
matter
now
if
we
were
all
accustomed
to
neat
round
heads
at
levees
and
balls
how
repulsive
it
would
be
to
see
a
man
with
two
ridiculous
wrinkled
appendages
sticking
out
from
the
sides
of
his
face
in
saying
this
i
am
not
drawing
on
my
fancy
but
on
my
memory
i
can
recollect
the
time
when
no
gentleman
still
less
any
lady
would
have
owned
a
terrier
with
its
ears
on
and
why
go
back
so
far
the
same
sentiment
is
prevalent
in
good
society
with
respect
to
men
beards
in
this
year
of
grace
and
smooth
faces
yet
if
one
chance
to
be
looking
at
a
rembrandt
instead
of
at
society
what
an
infinitely
handsomer
adjunct
to
a
noble
face
is
a
fine
beard
than
a
pair
of
ears
when
woman
first
looked
at
her
face
in
a
polished
saucepan
she
was
at
once
struck
with
the
comicality
of
those
things
and
bethought
herself
what
to
do
with
them
she
decided
to
use
them
for
pegs
to
hang
ornaments
on
the
improvement
excited
the
admiration
of
her
husband
and
the
envy
of
her
rivals
to
such
a
degree
that
all
other
women
of
taste
in
her
tribe
did
the
same
and
from
that
day
to
this
in
almost
every
country
in
the
world
it
has
been
accounted
a
shame
for
any
respectable
woman
to
show
her
face
in
public
in
the
hideousness
of
naked
ears
this
discovery
of
its
capabilities
gave
a
new
value
to
the
ear
and
a
large
roomy
one
became
an
asset
in
the
marriage
market
i
have
seen
a
pretty
little
damsel
of
sind
with
fourteen
jingling
silver
things
hanging
at
regular
intervals
from
the
outside
edge
of
each
ear
if
nature
had
been
niggardly
the
lobe
at
least
could
be
enlarged
by
boring
it
and
thrusting
in
a
small
wooden
peg
then
a
larger
one
and
so
on
until
it
could
hold
an
ivory
wheel
as
large
as
a
quoit
and
hung
down
to
the
shoulders
but
nature
surely
did
not
intend
the
ear
for
this
purpose
then
what
did
she
intend
a
popular
error
is
that
the
ears
are
given
to
hear
with
but
the
ears
can
not
hear
the
hearing
is
done
by
a
box
of
assorted
instruments
incus
etc
hidden
in
a
burrow
which
has
its
entrance
inside
of
the
ear
if
you
argue
that
the
ears
are
intended
to
catch
sounds
and
direct
them
down
to
the
hearing
instrument
then
explain
their
absurd
shape
they
are
useless
a
man
who
wants
to
hear
distinctly
puts
his
hand
to
his
ear
and
why
do
they
not
turn
to
meet
the
sounds
that
come
from
different
quarters
they
are
absolutely
immovable
and
therefore
also
expressionless
a
savage
expresses
his
mind
with
all
the
rest
of
his
face
he
smiles
and
grins
and
pouts
and
frowns
but
his
ears
stand
like
gravestones
with
the
inscriptions
effaced
how
different
is
the
case
when
you
turn
from
man
to
the
irrational
animals
the
eyes
of
a
fawn
are
lustrous
and
beautiful
but
they
would
be
as
meaningless
as
polished
stones
without
the
eloquent
ears
that
stand
behind
them
and
tell
her
thoughts
curiosity
suspicion
alarm
anger
submission
friendliness
every
emotion
that
flits
across
her
quick
sensitive
mind
speaks
through
them
they
are
in
touch
with
her
soul
and
half
the
music
of
her
life
is
played
on
them
and
if
you
abstract
yourself
from
individuals
and
look
at
that
thing
the
ear
in
the
wide
field
of
life
what
a
great
living
reality
it
is
a
spiritual
unity
under
infinite
diversity
of
material
form
and
fashion
it
is
like
the
telegraph
wire
overhead
the
commonest
and
plainest
of
material
things
but
charged
with
the
silent
and
invisible
currents
of
the
life
of
the
world
let
my
heart
be
still
a
moment
and
this
mystery
explore
illustration
or
perhaps
when
it
wants
to
listen
it
raises
a
flipper
to
its
ear
birds
have
no
ears
nor
have
crocodiles
nor
frogs
nor
snakes
ears
seem
to
be
for
beasts
only
and
not
for
all
beasts
seals
are
divided
by
naturalists
into
two
great
families
those
with
ears
and
those
without
the
common
seal
belongs
to
the
latter
class
and
the
to
the
former
a
common
seal
lives
in
the
sea
and
when
it
does
wriggle
up
on
the
beach
of
an
iceberg
there
is
nothing
to
hear
i
suppose
or
perhaps
when
it
wants
to
listen
it
raises
a
flipper
to
its
ear
i
never
saw
one
doing
so
but
we
do
not
see
everything
that
happens
in
the
world
the
with
its
stouter
limbs
can
lift
its
forepart
raise
its
head
and
look
about
it
and
even
flop
about
the
at
a
respectable
rate
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
one
of
these
is
as
much
above
an
earless
seal
as
fifty
years
of
europe
are
better
than
a
cycle
of
cathay
when
performing
seals
are
exhibited
at
a
circus
sitting
on
chairs
catching
balls
on
the
points
of
their
noses
and
playing
diabolo
with
them
or
balancing
billiard
cues
on
their
snouts
and
doing
other
miraculous
things
they
are
always
not
common
seals
of
course
i
do
not
mean
to
insinuate
that
invented
the
ear
and
stuck
it
on
that
would
be
unscientific
but
i
mean
that
their
general
intelligence
and
interest
in
affairs
created
that
demand
for
more
distinct
hearing
which
led
to
the
development
of
an
ear
trumpet
this
view
is
wholly
scientific
though
pedants
may
quarrel
with
my
way
of
putting
it
the
ears
are
very
minute
mere
apologies
one
might
think
but
do
be
hasty
the
finny
prey
of
the
makes
no
sound
as
it
skims
through
the
water
and
perhaps
the
padded
foot
of
that
stealthy
garrotter
the
polar
bear
makes
as
little
on
the
smooth
ice
for
catching
the
one
and
not
being
caught
by
the
other
the
must
trust
to
the
keenness
of
its
great
goggle
eyes
but
it
is
a
social
beast
and
it
wants
to
catch
the
bellowing
of
its
fellows
far
across
the
foggy
waste
of
and
that
little
leather
scoop
standing
behind
the
seems
to
be
just
the
instrument
required
to
catch
and
send
down
those
sounds
which
would
otherwise
glance
off
the
glossy
fur
and
never
find
entrance
to
the
tiny
orifice
at
all
if
it
were
any
larger
than
is
absolutely
necessary
it
would
be
a
serious
impediment
to
a
professional
diver
and
swimmer
like
the
this
is
the
reason
why
otters
have
very
small
ears
and
why
whales
and
porpoises
have
none
at
all
but
when
a
beast
lives
on
land
the
conditions
are
all
altered
and
then
the
ear
blossoms
out
into
an
infinite
variety
of
forms
and
sizes
from
each
of
which
the
true
naturalist
may
divine
the
manner
of
life
of
its
wearer
as
surely
as
the
palmist
tells
your
past
present
and
future
from
the
lines
on
your
hand
first
he
will
divide
all
beasts
into
those
that
pursue
and
those
that
flee
oppressors
and
oppressed
the
former
point
their
ears
forwards
but
the
latter
backwards
there
may
be
a
good
deal
of
free
play
in
both
cases
but
i
am
thinking
of
the
habitual
position
when
a
cat
is
making
its
felonious
way
along
the
garden
wall
wrapped
in
thoughts
of
blackbirds
and
thrushes
its
ears
look
straight
forwards
and
this
is
the
way
in
which
a
cat
portrait
is
always
taken
because
it
is
characteristic
it
can
not
turn
them
round
to
catch
sounds
from
behind
and
would
scorn
to
do
so
when
accosted
from
behind
it
turns
its
head
and
looks
danger
in
the
face
it
can
fold
them
down
backwards
when
the
danger
is
a
terrier
and
the
decks
are
cleared
for
action
but
that
is
another
story
contrast
brer
rabbit
as
he
comes
lopin
up
de
big
road
his
ears
are
turning
every
way
scouting
for
danger
not
always
in
unison
but
independently
but
when
he
is
at
rest
they
are
set
to
alarm
from
the
flank
and
rear
illustration
tear
out
the
house
like
the
dogs
wuz
atter
him
but
when
he
tear
out
the
house
like
the
dogs
wuz
atter
him
then
they
point
straight
back
he
was
made
to
be
eaten
and
he
knows
it
so
it
is
with
the
whole
tribe
of
deer
and
even
with
the
horse
pampered
and
cared
for
and
unacquainted
with
danger
his
ears
are
a
weathercock
registering
the
drift
of
all
his
petty
hopes
and
fears
i
see
the
left
ear
go
forward
and
prepare
for
a
desperate
shy
at
that
wheelbarrow
he
knows
a
wheelbarrow
familiarly
there
is
one
in
his
stall
all
day
but
i
am
taking
him
a
road
he
does
not
want
to
go
and
so
the
hypocrite
is
going
to
pretend
that
barrow
is
of
a
dangerous
sort
i
prepare
to
apply
a
he
sees
it
with
the
corner
of
his
eye
and
both
ears
turn
back
like
a
the
size
and
quality
of
the
ear
serve
to
show
how
far
the
owner
depends
on
it
you
will
never
begin
to
understand
nature
until
you
see
clearly
that
every
life
is
dominated
by
two
supreme
anxieties
which
push
aside
all
other
concerns
to
eat
and
not
to
be
eaten
the
one
is
uppermost
in
those
that
pursue
and
the
other
in
those
that
flee
now
if
the
pursuer
fails
he
loses
a
dinner
but
if
the
fugitive
fails
he
loses
his
life
from
which
it
follows
that
the
very
best
sort
of
ears
will
be
found
among
those
beasts
that
do
not
ravage
but
run
but
there
is
another
matter
to
be
taken
into
account
the
ears
are
not
the
whole
of
the
beast
outfit
it
has
eyes
and
it
has
a
nose
which
of
the
three
it
most
relies
on
depends
upon
the
manner
of
its
life
a
bird
lives
in
trees
or
the
air
looking
down
at
the
prowling
cat
or
up
at
the
hawk
hovering
in
the
clear
sky
so
it
does
not
keep
ears
and
its
nose
is
of
no
account
but
what
thing
can
see
like
a
bird
the
squirrel
also
lives
in
the
trees
and
its
ears
are
frivolously
decorated
with
tufts
of
hair
you
will
not
find
many
beasts
that
can
afford
to
prostitute
their
ears
to
ornamental
purposes
the
only
other
beast
that
i
can
think
of
at
this
moment
which
has
tufted
ears
is
the
lynx
now
the
lynx
is
a
tree
cat
and
there
is
proverbial
wisdom
in
the
saying
eyes
like
a
lynx
illustration
a
great
catholic
congress
of
distinguished
ears
but
go
to
the
timid
beasts
that
spend
their
lives
on
the
ground
among
grass
and
brushwood
and
woods
and
coppices
where
murderous
foes
are
prowling
unseen
and
you
will
see
ears
indeed
expansive
tremulous
turning
lightly
on
pivots
and
catching
like
large
the
mingled
murmur
of
rustling
leaves
and
snapping
twigs
and
chirping
insects
and
falling
seeds
and
the
slight
occasional
abrupt
fateful
sound
which
is
none
of
these
it
is
impossible
no
doubt
for
us
ever
to
think
ourselves
into
the
life
which
these
beasts
live
moving
thinking
and
sleeping
in
a
circumambient
atmosphere
of
sound
sitting
as
it
were
at
the
receiving
station
of
a
system
of
wireless
telegraphy
and
catching
of
floating
intelligence
from
all
quarters
mostly
undiscernible
by
us
if
we
listened
for
it
but
which
they
by
long
practice
instantly
locate
and
interpret
without
conscious
effort
the
zoologist
classifies
them
under
many
heads
the
field
mouse
and
rabbits
are
rodentia
the
deer
ungulata
the
kangaroos
marsupialia
in
my
museum
they
are
all
one
family
and
their
labels
are
their
ears
in
these
days
of
international
conferences
parliaments
of
religion
councils
might
we
not
arrange
for
a
great
catholic
congress
of
distinguished
ears
what
a
glow
of
new
life
it
would
shed
upon
our
straitened
traditional
ways
of
thinking
about
the
social
problems
of
our
humble
i
would
exclude
the
eared
owls
whose
ears
are
a
mere
sport
of
fashion
like
the
hideous
imitations
of
birds
wings
which
ladies
stick
on
their
hats
but
just
when
this
peep
into
the
rare
show
of
nature
is
lifting
my
soul
into
sublimity
i
am
brought
down
to
the
base
earth
again
by
an
exception
this
is
the
plague
of
all
high
science
you
design
a
stately
theory
collect
from
many
quarters
a
wealth
of
facts
to
establish
it
with
and
have
arranged
them
with
cumulative
and
irresistible
force
when
some
disgusting
uninvited
case
thrusts
itself
in
on
your
notice
and
refuses
to
fit
into
your
argument
at
all
in
this
instance
it
is
my
lord
the
elephant
that
he
has
no
need
to
concern
himself
about
any
bloodthirsty
beast
that
may
be
lurking
in
the
jungle
is
not
more
obvious
than
that
his
ears
are
the
biggest
in
the
world
now
there
are
two
ways
of
getting
rid
of
an
obstruction
of
this
kind
one
is
to
betake
yourself
to
your
thinking
chair
and
pipe
and
to
rake
up
the
possibilities
of
the
pleiocene
and
meiocene
ages
and
prove
that
when
the
immense
ear
of
the
elephant
was
evolved
there
must
have
been
some
carnivorous
monster
some
tiger
or
cave
bear
which
preyed
on
elephants
the
other
way
is
to
get
acquainted
with
the
elephant
cultivate
an
intimacy
with
him
and
find
out
what
his
ears
are
to
him
i
prefer
the
second
way
i
would
patiently
watch
him
as
he
stands
drowsily
under
an
umbrageous
banian
tree
on
a
sultry
day
before
the
monsoon
has
burst
and
refreshed
earth
and
air
so
might
i
note
that
his
ears
are
incessantly
moving
but
not
turning
this
way
and
that
to
catch
sounds
just
flapping
flapping
as
if
to
cool
his
great
temples
so
have
i
seen
the
gigantic
fruit
bats
called
flying
foxes
in
india
hanging
in
hundreds
in
the
upper
branches
of
a
tall
peepul
tree
at
noon
feeling
too
hot
to
sleep
and
all
fanning
themselves
in
unison
with
one
wing
a
comic
spectacle
and
at
each
flap
of
the
elephant
ears
i
would
observe
that
a
cloud
of
flies
for
the
elephant
is
not
too
great
to
be
pestered
by
the
despicable
hordes
of
beggars
for
blood
were
dislodged
from
their
feeding
grounds
about
his
head
and
neck
and
trying
to
settle
about
his
rear
parts
were
driven
back
again
by
the
swinging
of
his
tail
then
i
should
say
that
ear
is
just
a
fan
how
significant
it
is
that
among
the
emblems
of
royalty
in
the
east
the
three
chiefest
are
an
two
men
who
stand
behind
and
swing
great
punkahs
modelled
on
the
elephant
ear
and
two
others
carrying
yak
tails
wherewith
to
scare
the
flies
from
the
royal
person
the
elephant
is
a
rajah
there
is
another
mysterious
ear
which
is
a
to
the
simple
it
is
in
fashion
among
a
tribe
of
bats
to
which
belongs
the
vampire
of
india
this
monster
is
fond
of
coming
into
your
bedroom
at
midnight
through
the
open
windows
but
not
to
suck
your
blood
for
it
has
little
in
common
with
the
true
vampire
of
south
america
it
brings
its
dinner
with
it
and
hangs
from
the
ceiling
feeding
like
horses
when
you
hear
them
feed
you
hear
its
jaws
working
crunch
crunch
crunch
but
feel
too
drowsy
to
get
up
and
expel
it
when
you
get
up
in
the
morning
there
on
your
clean
dressing
table
just
below
the
place
where
it
hung
are
the
bloody
remains
of
a
sparrow
or
the
crumbs
of
a
the
servants
will
tell
you
that
the
sparrow
was
killed
and
eaten
by
a
rat
but
if
you
rise
softly
next
night
when
you
hear
the
sound
of
feeding
and
shut
the
windows
you
will
find
a
goblin
hanging
from
the
ceiling
in
the
morning
hideous
beyond
the
power
of
words
to
tell
its
ears
thin
membranous
and
longer
than
its
head
tremble
incessantly
inside
of
them
is
another
pair
much
smaller
than
the
first
and
tuned
to
their
octave
i
should
guess
while
two
membranous
smelling
trumpets
of
similar
pattern
rise
over
the
nose
what
is
the
meaning
of
these
repulsive
instruments
and
how
does
that
strange
beast
catch
sparrows
when
it
comes
out
after
dark
and
quarters
the
garden
passing
swiftly
under
and
through
the
branches
of
trees
they
are
sound
asleep
hidden
among
the
leaves
motionless
and
silent
but
their
flesh
may
be
scented
and
their
gentle
breathing
heard
if
you
have
instruments
sufficiently
delicate
then
the
ample
wings
may
suddenly
enfold
the
sleeping
body
and
the
savage
jaws
grip
the
startled
head
before
there
is
time
even
to
scream
without
a
doubt
this
is
the
secret
of
the
vampire
bat
ears
but
to
find
food
and
flee
death
are
not
the
only
interests
in
life
even
to
the
meanest
creature
there
are
social
pleasures
family
affections
and
fellowship
sympathy
and
in
the
struggles
of
life
and
there
is
love
omne
adeo

in
terris
hominumque
ferarumque
et

aequoreum
pecudes

volucres
in
furias
ignemque
ruunt
amor
omnibus
idem
the
chirping
of
the
cricket
the
song
of
the
lark
the
call
of
the
sentinel
crane
the
watchword
with
which
the
migratory
geese
keep
their
squadrons
together
the
howling
of
jackals
the
lowing
of
cows
the
hum
of
the
hive
the
chatter
of
the
and
a
hundred
other
voices
in
forest
and
field
and
town
remind
us
that
the
voice
and
the
ear
are
the
pair
of
wheels
on
which
society
runs
and
this
thought
points
the
way
out
of
another
contradictious
puzzle
that
which
confronts
my
argument
from
the
ears
of
an
ass
it
roams
treeless
deserts
where
no
foe
can
approach
unseen
thistles
make
no
sound
why
should
it
be
adorned
with
ears
which
in
their
amplitude
are
scarcely
surpassed
by
those
of
the
rabbit
and
the
hare
there
is
no
answer
unless
their
function
is
to
hear
the
bray
of
a
one
may
object
that
that
majestic
sound
is
surely
of
force
to
impress
itself
without
any
aid
from
an
external
ear
but
that
is
a
vain
argument
built
on
the
costermonger
moke
dreary
exile
from
its
fatherland
remember
that
its
ancestors
wandered
on
the
steppes
of
central
asia
or
the
borders
of
the
sahara
in
those
boundless
solitudes
with
nothing
that
eye
can
see
or
that
common
ear
can
hear
to
remind
her
that
she
is
not
the
sole
inhabitant
of
the
universe
the
wild
ass
snuffeth
up
the
wind
in
her
desire
and
lifting
her
windsails
to
the
hot
blast
hears
borne
across
miles
of
white
sand
and
shimmering
mirage
the
joyful
reverberations
of
that
music
which
tells
of
old
comrades
and
boon
companions
scouring
the
plain
and
kicking
up
their
exultant
heels
monkeys
taking
to
trees
were
like
the
birds
they
scarcely
needed
ears
and
so
by
the
high
road
of
evolution
you
arrive
at
man
and
the
enigma
of
his
ear
it
is
a
shrunken
and
shrivelled
remnant
a
ruin
a
derelict
ship
it
is
to
a
pattern
ear
what
the
old
shoe
which
you
find
in
a
country
lane
shed
from
the
foot
of
some
unemployed
is
to
one
of
waukenphast
boots
we
ought
to
temper
our
contempt
for
what
it
is
with
respect
for
what
it
was
all
the
parts
of
it
are
there
and
recognisable
even
to
the
muscles
that
should
move
it
but
we
have
lost
control
of
them
i
believe
anyone
could
regain
that
by
persevering
exercise
of
his
will
power
for
a
time
that
is
if
he
has
any
i
have
a
friend
who
if
you
treat
him
with
disrespect
shrivels
you
up
with
a
sarcastic
wag
of
his
right
ear
the
ears
of
dogs
open
up
another
vista
for
the
questioning
philosopher
their
day
is
past
too
and
man
may
cut
them
short
to
match
his
own
but
the
dog
grows
them
longer
than
before
when
he
first
took
service
with
man
and
grew
careless
and
lazy
the
muscles
got
slack
and
the
ears
dropped
which
is
in
accordance
with
nature
then
instead
of
being
allowed
to
wither
away
they
have
been
handed
over
to
the
milliner
and
shaped
and
trimmed
in
harmony
with
the
style
of
each
breed
of
dogs
how
it
has
been
done
is
one
of
those
mysteries
which
will
not
open
to
the
iron
keys
of
darwin
but
there
it
is
for
those
to
see
who
have
eyes
illustration
the
curls
of
a
mother
darling
the
ears
of
the
little
dogs
bred
for
ladies
laps
are
the
curls
of
a
mother
darling
the
pendant
of
the
old
old
maid
who
despite
of
changeful
fashions
clings
to
those
memorials
of
the
pensive
beauty
of
her
youth
are
repeated
in
solemn
mimicry
by
the
dachshund
trotting
at
her
heels
but
the
sensible
fur
cap
of
the
dignified
newfoundland
reminds
us
of
the
cold
regions
from
which
his
forefathers
came
some
kinds
of
terriers
still
have
their
ears
starched
up
to
look
perky
and
i
have
occasionally
seen
a
dog
with
one
ear
up
and
the
other
down
as
if
straining
after
the
elusive
idea
expressed
in
the
hat
all
which
shows
that
one
touch
of
nature
makes
the
whole
world
kin
vi
tommy
the
story
of
an
owl
among
the
many
and
various
strangers
within
my
gates
who
have
helped
to
enliven
the
days
of
my
exile
tommy
was
one
towards
whom
i
still
feel
a
certain
sense
of
obligation
because
he
taught
me
for
the
first
time
what
an
owl
is
for
tommy
was
an
owl
from
any
dictionary
you
may
ascertain
that
an
owl
is
a
nocturnal
carnivorous
bird
of
a
short
stout
form
with
downy
feathers
and
a
large
head
and
if
that
does
not
satisfy
you
there
is
no
lack
of
books
which
will
furnish
fuller
and
more
precise
descriptions
but
descriptions
can
not
impart
acquaintance
i
had
sought
acquaintance
and
had
gained
some
knowledge
such
as
books
can
not
supply
not
only
of
owls
in
general
but
of
that
particular
species
of
owls
to
which
tommy
belonged
who
in
the
heraldry
of
ornithology
was
an
indian
spotted
owlet
this
branch
of
the
ancient
family
of
owls
has
always
been
eccentric
it
does
not
mope
and
to
the
moon
complain
it
flouts
the
moon
and
the
sun
and
everyone
who
passes
by
showing
its
round
face
at
its
door
and
even
coming
out
at
odd
times
of
the
day
to
stare
and
bob
and
play
the
clown
it
does
not
cry
tuwhoo
tuwhoo
as
the
poets
would
have
it
but
laughs
jabbers
squeaks
and
chants
clamorous
duets
with
its
spouse
all
this
i
knew
i
had
also
gathered
from
his
public
appearances
that
a
spotted
owlet
is
happy
in
his
domestic
life
and
that
he
is
fond
of
fat
white
ants
for
when
their
winged
swarms
were
flying
i
had
seen
him
making
short
flights
from
his
perch
in
a
tree
and
catching
them
with
his
feet
and
i
believed
that
he
fed
in
secret
on
mice
and
lizards
but
all
that
did
not
amount
to
understanding
an
owl
as
i
discovered
when
tommy
became
a
member
of
our
chummery
tommy
was
born
in
the
second
city
of
the
british
empire
to
wit
bombay
in
the
month
of
march
his
birthplace
was
a
hole
in
an
old
coral
tree
domestic
life
in
that
hole
was
not
conducted
with
regularity
meals
were
at
uncertain
hours
and
uncertain
also
in
their
quantity
and
quality
the
parents
were
hunters
and
were
absent
for
long
periods
and
though
there
was
incredible
shouting
and
laughter
when
they
returned
they
came
at
such
irregular
times
that
we
did
not
suspect
that
they
were
permanent
residents
and
had
a
family
one
night
however
tommy
being
precocious
and
as
we
discovered
afterwards
keen
on
seeing
life
took
advantage
of
parental
absence
to
clamber
to
the
entrance
of
the
nursery
and
losing
his
balance
toppled
over
into
the
garden
he
kept
cool
however
and
tried
to
conceal
himself
but
hurree
the
malee
watering
the
plants
early
in
the
morning
spied
him
lying
with
his
face
on
the
earth
and
brought
him
to
us
he
seemed
dead
but
he
was
very
much
alive
as
appeared
when
he
was
made
to
sit
up
and
turned
those
wonderful
eyes
of
his
upon
us
he
was
a
droll
little
object
at
that
time
nearly
globular
in
form
and
covered
with
down
like
a
toy
for
children
to
play
with
his
head
turned
like
a
revolving
lighthouse
and
flared
those
eyes
upon
you
wherever
you
went
great
luminous
orbs
and
and
full
of
silent
wonder
or
i
should
rather
say
surprise
this
never
left
him
to
the
last
everything
that
presented
itself
to
his
gaze
though
he
had
seen
it
a
hundred
times
seemed
to
fill
him
with
fresh
surprise
nothing
ever
became
familiar
what
an
enviable
cast
of
mind
it
must
make
the
brightness
of
childhood
perennial
there
was
some
discussion
as
to
how
tommy
should
be
fed
and
we
finally
decided
that
one
should
try
to
open
the
small
hooked
beak
whose
point
could
just
be
detected
protruding
from
a
nest
of
fluff
while
another
held
a
piece
of
raw
meat
ready
to
pop
in
it
did
not
look
an
easy
job
but
we
had
scarcely
set
about
it
when
tommy
himself
solved
the
difficulty
by
plucking
the
meat
out
of
our
fingers
and
swallowing
it
this
early
intimation
that
however
absent
he
might
look
he
was
all
there
was
never
belied
and
there
was
no
further
difficulty
about
the
feeding
of
him
when
he
saw
us
coming
he
always
fell
into
the
same
ridiculous
attitude
with
his
face
in
the
dust
but
we
just
picked
him
up
and
stood
him
on
his
proper
end
and
showed
him
the
meat
and
his
bashfulness
vanished
at
once
after
sunset
he
would
get
lively
and
begin
calling
for
his
mother
in
a
strange
husky
voice
at
this
time
we
would
let
him
out
in
the
garden
watching
him
closely
for
if
he
thought
he
was
alone
he
would
sneak
away
slyly
then
make
a
run
for
liberty
hobbling
along
at
a
good
rate
with
the
aid
of
his
wings
though
he
never
attempted
to
fly
as
yet
when
detected
and
overtaken
he
fell
on
his
face
as
before
one
memorable
day
he
found
a
hole
in
a
stone
wall
and
before
we
could
stop
him
he
was
in
the
hole
was
too
small
to
admit
a
hand
though
not
a
rat
or
a
snake
so
the
prospect
was
gloomy
suddenly
a
happy
inspiration
came
to
me
that
sad
husky
cry
with
which
he
expressed
his
need
of
a
mother
was
not
difficult
to
mimic
and
he
might
be
cheated
into
thinking
that
a
lost
brother
or
sister
was
looking
for
him
i
retired
and
made
the
attempt
and
hark
a
faint
echo
came
from
the
wall
at
each
repetition
it
became
clearer
until
the
round
face
and
great
eyes
appeared
at
the
mouth
of
the
hole
then
the
round
body
tumbled
out
and
little
tommy
was
hobbling
about
looking
with
pathetic
eagerness
for
the
old
familiar
faces
when
he
discovered
how
he
had
been
betrayed
his
face
went
down
and
he
suffered
himself
to
be
carried
quietly
to
the
canary
cage
in
which
he
was
kept
it
seemed
to
be
time
now
to
begin
tommy
education
for
i
judged
that
if
he
had
been
at
home
he
would
ere
then
have
been
getting
nightly
lessons
in
the
poacher
art
so
i
procured
a
small
gecko
one
of
those
grey
house
lizards
with
pellets
at
the
ends
of
their
toes
which
come
down
from
the
roof
after
the
lamps
are
lit
and
gorge
themselves
on
the
foolish
moths
and
plant
bugs
that
come
to
the
light
securing
it
with
a
thin
cord
tied
round
its
waist
i
introduced
it
into
tommy
cage
he
looked
surprised
very
much
surprised
he
raised
himself
to
his
full
height
he
gazed
at
it
he
curtseyed
he
gave
a
little
jump
and
was
standing
with
both
feet
on
the
lizard
a
moment
more
and
the
lizard
was
gliding
down
his
throat
with
my
thin
cord
after
it
seton
thompson
would
have
us
believe
that
all
young
things
are
laboriously
trained
by
their
parents
just
like
human
children
and
if
he
was
an
of
all
the
scenes
that
he
describes
so
vividly
it
must
be
so
with
other
young
things
but
he
did
not
know
tommy
who
is
the
bird
of
minerva
and
evidently
sprang
into
being
like
his
patron
goddess
with
all
his
armour
on
after
a
time
when
he
had
exchanged
his
infant
down
for
a
suit
of
feathers
he
was
promoted
to
a
large
cage
out
in
the
garden
and
his
regular
diet
was
a
little
raw
meat
or
a
mutton
bone
tied
to
one
of
his
perches
but
by
way
of
a
treat
i
would
offer
him
whenever
i
could
get
it
a
locust
or
large
grasshopper
his
way
of
accepting
this
was
unique
and
pretty
he
would
look
surprised
stare
curtsey
once
or
twice
stare
again
and
then
suddenly
noiselessly
and
as
lightly
as
a
fairy
flit
across
the
cage
and
without
alighting
pluck
the
insect
from
my
fingers
with
both
his
feet
and
return
to
his
perch
why
he
bowed
to
his
food
and
to
everybody
and
everything
that
presented
itself
before
him
was
a
riddle
that
i
never
solved
a
materialistic
friend
suggested
that
he
was
adjusting
the
focus
of
his
wonderful
eyes
and
the
action
was
certainly
like
that
of
an
optician
examining
a
lens
but
i
feel
that
there
was
something
more
ceremonial
about
it
this
punctiliousness
cost
him
his
dinner
once
i
was
curious
to
know
what
he
would
do
with
a
mouse
so
having
caught
one
alive
i
slipped
it
quietly
into
his
cage
he
was
more
surprised
than
ever
before
raised
himself
erect
bowed
to
the
earth
once
twice
and
three
times
stared
bowed
again
and
so
on
until
to
his
evident
astonishment
and
chagrin
the
mouse
found
an
opening
and
was
gone
the
lesson
was
not
lost
a
few
days
later
i
got
another
mouse
to
which
he
began
to
do
obeisance
as
before
but
very
soon
and
suddenly
though
as
softly
as
falling
snow
he
plumped
upon
it
with
both
feet
and
spreading
his
wings
on
the
ground
looked
all
round
him
with
infinite
satisfaction
the
mouse
squeaked
but
he
stopped
that
by
cracking
its
skull
quietly
with
his
beak
then
he
gathered
himself
up
and
flew
to
the
perch
with
his
prize
one
thing
i
noted
about
tommy
most
emphatically
he
never
showed
a
sign
of
affection
or
what
is
called
attachment
he
maintained
a
strictly
bowing
acquaintance
with
me
he
was
not
afraid
but
he
would
suffer
no
familiarity
he
would
come
and
eat
with
due
ceremony
out
of
my
hand
but
if
i
offered
to
touch
him
he
was
surprised
and
affronted
and
went
off
at
once
when
i
moved
to
another
house
i
found
that
i
could
not
continue
to
keep
him
so
i
sent
him
to
the
zoological
garden
where
i
visited
him
sometimes
but
he
never
vouchsafed
a
token
of
recognition
his
heart
was
locked
except
to
his
own
kin
but
since
that
time
when
i
have
seen
an
owl
even
a
barn
owl
or
a
great
horned
owl
swiftly
cross
the
sky
in
the
darkness
of
night
i
have
felt
that
i
could
accompany
it
in
imagination
on
its
secret
quest
it
will
arrive
silently
like
the
angel
of
death
in
a
tree
overlooking
a
field
in
which
a
rat
whose
hour
has
come
is
furtively
feeding
all
alert
and
tremulous
but
unaware
of
any
impending
danger
the
rat
will
go
on
feeding
unconscious
of
the
mocking
curtsey
and
the
baleful
eyes
that
follow
with
mute
attention
its
every
motion
until
the
hand
of
the
clock
has
moved
to
the
point
assigned
by
fate
and
then
it
will
feel
eight
sharp
talons
plunged
into
its
flesh
i
have
seen
the
fierce
dash
of
the
sparrow
hawk
into
a
crowd
of
unsuspecting
sparrows
i
know
the
triumph
of
the
falcon
as
it
rises
for
the
final
fatal
swoop
on
the
flying
duck
and
i
have
watched
the
kestrel
high
in
air
scanning
the
field
for
some
rash
mouse
or
lizard
that
has
wandered
too
far
from
shelter
the
owl
is
also
a
bird
of
prey
but
its
idea
is
different
from
all
these
vii
the
barn
owl
a
friend
of
man
a
thunderstorm
has
burst
on
the
common
rat
its
complicity
in
the
spread
of
the
plague
which
has
been
proved
up
to
the
hilt
has
filled
the
cup
of
its
iniquities
to
overflowing
and
we
have
awakened
to
the
fact
that
it
is
and
always
has
been
an
of
mankind
simultaneously
in
widely
separated
parts
of
the
world
a
pogrom
has
been
proclaimed
and
the
accounts
of
the
massacre
which
come
to
us
from
great
cities
like
calcutta
and
bombay
are
appalling
and
almost
incredible
they
would
move
to
pity
the
most
callous
heart
if
pity
could
be
associated
with
the
rat
but
it
can
not
the
wild
rat
deserves
that
humane
consideration
to
which
all
our
natural
on
this
earth
are
entitled
but
the
domestic
rat
i
use
this
term
advisedly
for
though
man
has
not
domesticated
it
it
has
thoroughly
domesticated
itself
can
not
justify
its
existence
it
is
a
fungus
of
civilisation
if
it
confined
itself
to
its
natural
food
the
farmer
grain
the
tax
which
it
levies
on
the
country
would
still
be
such
as
no
free
people
ought
to
endure
but
it
confines
itself
to
nothing
as
waterton
says
after
dining
on
carrion
in
the
filthiest
sink
it
will
often
manage
to
sup
on
the
choicest
dainties
of
the
larder
where
like
celoeno
of
old
foeda
it
kills
chickens
plunders
the
nests
of
little
birds
devouring
mother
eggs
and
young
murders
and
feeds
on
its
brothers
and
sisters
and
even
its
own
offspring
and
not
infrequently
tastes
even
man
when
it
finds
him
asleep
the
bite
of
a
rat
is
sometimes
very
poisonous
and
i
have
had
to
give
three
months
sick
leave
to
a
clerk
who
had
been
bitten
by
one
add
to
this
that
the
rat
multiplies
at
a
rate
which
is
simply
criminal
rearing
a
family
of
perhaps
a
dozen
every
two
or
three
months
and
no
further
argument
is
needed
to
justify
the
war
which
has
been
declared
against
it
every
engine
of
war
will
no
doubt
be
brought
into
use
traps
of
many
kinds
poisons
cats
the
professional
and
a
rat
bacillus
which
if
once
it
gets
a
footing
is
expected
to
originate
a
fearful
epidemic
but
i
need
not
linger
any
more
among
rats
which
are
not
my
subject
i
am
writing
in
the
hope
that
this
may
be
an
opportune
time
to
put
in
a
plea
for
a
much
persecuted
native
of
this
and
many
other
countries
whose
principal
function
in
the
economy
of
nature
is
to
kill
rats
and
mice
the
barn
or
screech
owl
which
is
found
over
a
great
part
of
europe
and
asia
and
also
in
america
was
once
very
common
in
britain
inhabiting
every
tower
church
steeple
barn
loft
hollow
tree
or
dovecot
in
which
it
could
get
a
lodging
but
it
was
never
welcome
like
the
jews
in
the
days
of
king
john
it
has
been
relentlessly
persecuted
by
superstition
ignorance
and
avarice
avarice
instigated
by
ladies
and
milliners
has
looked
with
covetous
eye
on
its
downy
and
beautiful
plumes
while
ignorance
and
superstition
have
feared
and
hated
the
owl
in
all
countries
and
all
ages
in
ancient
rome
it
was
a
bird
of
evil
omen
foedaque
fit
volucris
venturi
nuncia
luctus
ignavus
bubo
dirum
mortalibus
omen
in
india
if
an
owl
sits
on
the
the
occupants
dare
scarcely
lie
down
to
sleep
for
they
know
that
the
devil
is
walking
the
rooms
and
marking
someone
for
death
lady
macbeth
when
about
the
murder
of
duncan
starts
and
whispers
hark
peace
it
was
the
owl
that
shrieked
the
fatal
bellman
and
even
as
late
as
the
nineteenth
century
waterton
aged
housekeeper
knew
full
well
what
sorrow
it
had
brought
into
other
houses
when
she
was
a
young
woman
witches
like
modern
ladies
of
fashion
set
great
value
on

the
latter

the
witches
in
macbeth
threw
them
into
their
boiling
cauldron
horace
canidia
could
not
complete
her
recipe
without
plumamque
nocturnae
strigis
we
may
suppose
that
in
britain
these
superstitions
are
gone
for
ever
killed
and
buried
by
board
schools
and
compulsory
education
if
they
are
there
is
room
for
an
they
have
been
succeeded
by
a
worse
the
superstition
of
gamekeepers
and
farmers
it
is
worse
in
effect
because
these
men
have
guns
which
their
predecessors
had
not
and
it
is
more
wicked
because
it
is
founded
on
an
ignorance
for
which
there
is
no
excuse
how
little
harm
the
barn
owl
is
likely
to
do
game
may
be
inferred
from
the
fact
that
when
it
makes
its
lodging
in
a
dovecot
the
pigeons
suffer
no
concern
waterton
and
no
better
authority
could
be
quoted
scouts
the
idea
common
among
farmers
that
its
business
there
is
to
eat
the
pigeons
eggs
they
lay
the
saddle
he
says
on
the
wrong
horse
they
ought
to
put
it
on
the
rat
his
predecessor
in
the
estate
had
allowed
the
owls
to
be
destroyed
and
the
rats
to
multiply
and
there
were
few
young
pigeons
in
the
dovecot
waterton
took
strong
measures
to
exterminate
the
rats
but
built
breeding
places
for
the
owls
and
the
dovecot
which
they
constantly
frequented
became
prolific
again
but
granting
that
the
owls
did
twice
the
injury
to
game
with
which
they
are
credited
it
would
be
repaid
many
times
over
by
their
services
waterton
well
says
that
if
we
knew
its
utility
in
thinning
the
country
of
mice
it
would
be
with
us
what
the
ibis
was
with
the
egyptians
a
sacred
bird
he
examined
the
pellets
ejected
by
a
pair
of
owls
that
occupied
a
ruined
gateway
on
the
estate
every
pellet
contained
skeletons
of
from
four
to
seven
mice
owls
it
may
be
necessary
to
explain
swallow
their
food
without
separating
flesh
from
bone
skin
and
hair
and
afterwards
disgorge
the
indigestible
portions
rolled
up
into
little
balls
in
sixteen
months
the
pair
of
owls
had
accumulated
a
deposit
of
more
than
a
bushel
of
these
pellets
each
a
funeral
urn
of
from
four
to
seven
mice
in
the
old
portuguese
fort
of
bassein
in
western
india
i
noticed
that
the
earth
at
the
foot
of
a
ruined
tower
was
plentifully
mixed
with
small
skulls
jaws
and
other
bones
taking
home
a
handful
and
examining
them
i
found
that
they
were
the
remains
of
rats
mice
and
muskrats
the
owl
kills
small
birds
large
insects
frogs
and
even
fishes
but
these
are
extras
its
profession
is
and
mousing
and
only
those
who
have
a
very
intimate
personal
acquaintance
with
it
know
how
peculiarly
its
equipment
and
methods
are
adapted
to
this
work
the
falcon
gives
open
chase
to
the
wild
duck
keeping
above
it
if
possible
until
near
enough
for
a
last
spurt
then
it
comes
down
at
a
speed
which
is
terrific
and
striking
the
duck
from
above
dashes
it
to
the
ground
the
sparrow
hawk
plunges
unexpectedly
into
a
group
of
little
birds
and
nips
up
one
with
a
long
outstretched
foot
before
they
have
time
to
get
clear
of
each
other
the
harrier
skims
over
field
copse
and
meadow
suddenly
rounding
corners
and
topping
fences
and
surprising
small
birds
or
mice
on
which
it
drops
before
they
have
recovered
from
their
surprise
the
owl
does
none
of
these
things
for
one
thing
it
hunts
in
the
night
when
its
sight
is
keenest
and
rats
are
abroad
feeding
its
flight
is
almost
noiseless
and
yet
marvellously
light
and
rapid
when
it
pleases
sailing
over
field
lane
and
hedgerow
and
examining
the
ground
as
it
goes
it
finds
a
likely
place
and
takes
a
post
of
observation
on
a
fence
perhaps
or
a
sheaf
of
corn
here
it
sits
bolt
upright
all
eyes
it
sees
a
rat
emerge
from
the
grass
and
advance
slowly
as
it
feeds
into
open
ground
there
is
no
hurry
for
the
doom
of
that
rat
is
already
fixed
so
the
owl
just
sits
and
watches
till
the
right
moment
has
arrived
then
it
flits
swiftly
softly
silently
across
the
intervening
space
and
drops
like
a
flake
of
snow
without
warning
or
suspicion
of
danger
the
rat
feels
eight
sharp
claws
buried
in
its
flesh
it
protests
with
frantic
squeals
but
these
are
stopped
with
a
nip
that
crunches
its
skull
and
the
owl
is
away
with
it
to
the
old
tower
where
the
hungry
children
are
calling
with
weird
impatient
hisses
for
something
to
eat
the
owl
does
not
hunt
the
fields
and
hedgerows
only
it
goes
to
all
places
where
rats
or
mice
may
be
reconnoitres
farmyards
barns
and
dwelling
houses
and
boldly
enters
open
windows
sometimes
it
hovers
in
the
air
like
a
kestrel
scanning
the
ground
below
and
though
its
regular
hunting
hours
are
from
dusk
till
dawn
it
has
been
seen
at
work
as
late
as
nine
or
ten
on
a
bright
summer
morning
but
the
vulgar
boys
of
bird
society
are
fond
of
mobbing
it
when
it
appears
abroad
by
day
and
it
dislikes
publicity
the
barn
owl
lays
its
eggs
in
the
places
which
it
inhabits
there
is
usually
a
thick
bed
of
pellets
on
the
floor
and
it
considers
no
other
nest
needful
the
eggs
are
said
to
be
laid
in
pairs
there
may
be
two
four
or
six
of
different
eggs
in
the
nest
and
perhaps
a
young
one
or
two
at
the
same
time
eggs
are
found
from
april
or
even
march
till
june
or
july
and
there
is
sometimes
at
any
rate
a
second
brood
as
late
as
november
or
december
this
owl
does
not
hoot
but
screeches
a
weird
and
ghostly
voice
it
is
from
which
according
to
ovid
the
bird
has
its
latin
name
strix
pronounced
streex
probably
at
that
time
est
illis
strigibus
nomen
sed
nominis
hujus
causa
quod
horrenda
stridere
nocte
silent
it
is
a
sound
which
coming
suddenly
out
of
the
darkness
might
well
start
fears
and
forebodings
in
the
dark
and
guilty
mind
of
untutored
man
which
would
not
be
dispelled
by
a
nearer
view
of
the
strange
object
from
which
they
proceeded
white
ghostly
upright
and
biggest
at
the
top
where
two
great
orbs
flare
like
fiery
from
the
centres
of
two
round
white
targets
it
stands
solemn
and
speechless
you
approach
nearer
and
it
falls
into
fearsome
pantomimic
attitudes
and
grimaces
like
a
clown
trying
to
frighten
a
child
and
now
a
new
horror
has
been
added
to
the
barn
owl
the
numerous
letters
which
appeared
in
and
were
summarised
with
comments
by
sir
digby
pigott
in
contemporary
of
july
leave
no
reasonable
room
for
doubt
that
this
bird
sometimes
becomes
brightly
luminous
and
is
the
for
believing
in
which
we
are
deriding
our
forefathers
all
things
considered
i
can
not
withhold
my
sympathy
and
some
respect
for
the
superstition
of
aged
housekeepers
romans
and
indians
for
that
of
gamekeepers
and
farmers
i
have
neither
all
our
new
schemes
of
nature
study
will
surely
deserve
the
reproach
of
futility
if
in
the
next
generation
every
farmhouse
in
england
has
not
its
own
owl
tower
for
the
encouragement
of
this
friend
of

viii
domestic
animals
long
before

consult
other
records
of
the
infancy
of
the
human
race
they
reveal
as
little
when
the
egyptians
began
to
portray
their
daily
life
on
stone
or
years
ago
they
already
had
cattle
and
sheep
geese
and
ducks
and
dogs
and
plenty
of
asses
though
not
horses
they
got
these
from
the
assyrians
who
had
used
them
in
their
chariots
long
before
they
began
to
record
anything
further
back
than
this
we
have
no
one
to
question
except
those
shadowy
men
of
the
stone
age
who
have
left
us
heaps
of
their
implements
but
none
of
their
bones
they
were
not
so
careful
of
the
bones
of
horses
which
lie
in
thousands
about
the
precincts
of
their
untidy
villages
but
not
a
scrawl
on
a
bit
of
a
mammoth
tusk
has
been
found
to
indicate
whether
these
were
ridden
and
driven
or
only
hunted
and
eaten
why
should
it
be
recorded
that
cadmus
invented
letters
why
should
we
inquire
who
first
made
gunpowder
and
glass
why
should
every
schoolboy
be
taught
that
watt
was
the
inventor
of
the
steam
engine
can
any
of
these
be
put
in
the
scale
as
benefactors
of
our
race
with
the
man
who
first
trained
a
horse
to
carry
him
on
its
back
or
drew
milk
with
his
hands
from
the
udders
of
a
cow
the
familiarity
of
the
thing
has
made
us
callous
to
the
wonder
of
it
let
us
put
it
before
us
like
a
painting
or
a
statue
and
have
a
good
look
at
it
there
is
a
farmhouse
any
common
farmhouse
just
one
of
the
molecules
that
constitute
the
mass
of
our
wholesome
country
life
a
horse
is
being
harnessed
for
the
plough
its
ancestors
sniffed
the
wind
on
the
steppes
of
tartary
meek
cows
are
standing
to
be
milked
when
primitive
man
first
knew
them
in
their
native
forests
he
used
to
give
them
a
wide
berth
for
his
flint
arrows
fell
harmless
off
their
tough
hides
and
they
were
fierce
exceedingly
a
cock
is
crowing
on
the
fence
as
if
the
whole
farm
belonged
to
himself
he
ought
to
be
skulking
in
an
indian
jungle
the
sheep
have
no
business
here
their
place
is
on
the
rocky
mountains
of
asia
as
for
the
dog
it
is
difficult
to
assign
it
a
country
for
it
owns
no
wild
kindred
in
any
part
of
the
world
but
it
ought
at
least
to
be
worrying
the
sheep
if
there
is
an
ass
it
is
a
native
of
abyssinia
and
the
turkeys
are
americans
the
cat
derives
its
descent
from
an
egyptian
but
all
these
are
of
one
country
now
and
of
one
religion
they
know
no
home
nor
desire
any
except
the
farmhouse
in
which
they
were
born
and
bred
and
the
lord
of
it
is
their
lord
to
whom
they
look
for
food
and
protection
and
what
would
he
do
without
them
what
should
we
do
without
them
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
that
life
could
be
carried
on
if
we
were
deprived
of
these
obedient
and
uncomplaining
servants
high
civilisation
has
been
attained
without
steam
engines
education
as
we
use
the
term
now
is
superfluous
runjeet
singh
the
lion
of
the
punjab
could
neither
read
nor
write
the
human
race
has
prospered
and
multiplied
without
the
knowledge
of
iron
but
we
know
of
no
time
when
man
did
without
domestic
animals
it
is
vain
to
speculate
how
the
thing
first
came
about
whether
the
sportive
anthropoid
ape
took
to
riding
on
a
wild
goat
before
he
emerged
as
a
man
keeping
flocks
or
whether
some
great
pioneer
destined
to
be
worshipped
in
after
ages
as
a
demigod
showed
his
fellows
how
the
wild
calves
if
taken
young
might
be
trained
into
tractable
slaves
and
it
is
hopeless
to
expect
that
any
record
will
now
leap
to
light
which
will
give
us
knowledge
in
place
of
speculation
but
it
might
not
be
unprofitable
to
seek
for
some
clue
to
the
strange
selection
which
the
domesticating
genius
of
man
has
made
from
among
the
multifarious
material
presented
to
it
by
the
animal
kingdom
if
we
do
so
we
shall
almost
be
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
domesticability
is
a
character
or
quality
inherent
in
some
animals
and
entirely
wanting
in
others
let
us
begin
with
pigeons
a
very
large
group
but
one
that
shows
more
unity
than
any
of
the
other
orders
into
which
naturalists
divide
birds
it
embraces
turtle
doves
of
many
species
wood
pigeons
ground
pigeons
fruit
pigeons
and
some
strange
forms
like
the
great
crowned
pigeon
of
victoria
of
all
these
only
one
the
common
blue
rock
has
been
domesticated
the
ring
dove
of
asia
has
been
kept
as
a
cage
bird
for
so
long
that
a
permanent
albino
and
also
a
variety
have
been
established
and
are
more
common
in
aviaries
than
birds
of
the
natural
colour
but
the
ring
dove
has
not
become
a
domestic
fowl
and
never
will
in
this
instance
there
is
a
plausible
explanation
for
the
blue
rock
unlike
the
rest
of
the
tribe
nests
and
roosts
in
holes
and
is
also
gregarious
therefore
if
provided
with
accommodation
of
the
kind
it
requires
it
will
form
a
permanent
settlement
and
remain
with
us
on
the
same
terms
as
the
honey
bee
while
the
ring
dove
not
caring
for
a
fixed
home
must
be
confined
however
tame
it
may
become
or
it
will
wander
and
be
lost
but
this
explanation
will
not
fit
other
cases
what
a
multitude
of
wild
ducks
there
are
in
scotland
and
every
other
country
mallards
pintails
gadwalls
widgeons
pochards
and
teals
all
very
much
alike
in
their
habits
and
tastes
but
of
them
all
only
one
species
and
that
a
migratory
one
the
mallard
has
been
persuaded
to
abandon
its
wandering
ways
and
settle
down
to
a
life
of
ease
and
obesity
as
a
dependant
of
man
in
india
there
is
a
duck
of
the
same
genus
as
the
mallard
known
as
the
duck
which
is
as
large
as
the
mallard
and
quite
as
tasty
and
is
moreover
not
migratory
but
remains
and
breeds
in
the
country
but
it
has
not
been
domesticated
the
tame
ducks
in
india
as
here
are
all
mallards
the
muscovy
duck
is
a
distinct
species
which
has
been
domesticated
elsewhere
and
introduced
from
the
ducks
let
us
turn
to
the
hens
the
partridge
grouse
and
pheasant
are
all
dainty
birds
but
if
we
desire
to
eat
them
we
must
shoot
them
or
pudor
snare
them
plover
eggs
are
worth
four
shillings
a
dozen
but
we
must
seek
them
on
the
moors
the
birds
that
have
covenanted
to
accept
our
food
and
protection
and
lay
their
eggs
for
our
use
and
rear
their
young
for
us
to
kill
are
descended
from
the
jungle
fowl
of
eastern
india
how
they
came
here
history
records
not
perhaps
the
gipsies
brought
them
they
appear
now
in
strange
and
diverse
guise
the
ponderous
and
the
and
wiry
game
the
crested
houdan
the
minorca
with
its
monstrous
comb
and
the
puny
bantam
in
japan
there
is
a
breed
that
carries
a
tail
seven
or
eight
feet
in
length
which
has
to
be
done
regularly
like
a
lady
hair
to
keep
it
from
dirt
and
damage
but
however
their
outward
aspects
may
differ
they
are
of
the
same
blood
and
know
it
a
featherweight
bantam
cock
will
stand
up
to
an
elephantine
brahma
and
fight
him
according
to
the
rules
of
the
ring
and
next
minute
pay
compliments
to
his
lady
in
language
which
she
will
be
at
no
loss
to
understand
and
if
the
artificial
conditions
of
their
life
were
removed
they
would
soon
all
lapse
alike
to
the
image
of
the
stock
from
which
they
are
sprung
this
is
well
illustrated
in
a
show
case
in
the
south
kensington
museum
exhibiting
a
group
of
fowls
from
island
these
are
descended
from
some
stock
landed
by
the
mutinous
crew
of
in
which
ran
wild
and
in
a
century
they
have
gone
back
to
the
small
size
and
lithe
figure
and
almost
to
the
game
colour
of
the
wild
birds
from
which
they
branched
off
before
history
dawned
if
we
turn
next
to
the
ruminants
the
clean
beasts
which
chew
the
cud
and
divide
the
hoof
the
puzzle
becomes
harder
still
deer
and
antelopes
are
often
kept
as
pets
and
become
so
tame
that
they
are
allowed
to
wander
at
liberty
in
egypt
herds
of
gazelles
were
so
kept
before
the
days
of
cheops
in
india
i
have
known
a
black
buck
which
regularly
attended
the
station
cricket
ground
moving
among
the
nervous
players
with
its
nose
in
the
air
and
insolence
in
its
gait
fully
aware
that
horns
with
very
sharp
points
insured
respectful
treatment
sterndale
trained
a
neilghai
to
go
in
harness
the
great
bovine
antelopes
of
africa
would
become
as
tame
and
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
their
beef
and
milk
would
not
be
as
good
as
those
of
the
cow
but
no
antelope
or
deer
appears
ever
to
have
been
domesticated
with
the
exception
of
the
reindeer
of
the
other
ruminants
the
ox
buffalo
yak
goat
sheep
and
a
few
others
are
domestic
animals
while
the
bison
and
the
gaur
or
indian
bison
and
a
large
number
of
wild
goats
and
sheep
have
been
neglected
the
buffalo
and
yak
have
probably
come
under
the
yoke
in
comparatively
recent
times
for
they
are
little
changed
but
the
goat
and
still
more
the
sheep
have
undergone
a
wonderful
transformation
within
and
without
who
could
recognise
in
a
leicester
ewe
the
wary
denizen
of
precipitous
mountains
which
will
not
feed
until
it
has
set
a
sentinel
to
give
warning
if
danger
approaches
and
here
is
a
curious
fact
which
has
scarcely
been
noticed
by
naturalists
the
original
of
our
goat
is
supposed
to
be
the
persian
ibex
at
any
rate
it
was
an
ibex
of
some
species
as
its
horns
plainly
show
but
on
the
plains
of
northern
india
under
ranges
of
hills
on
which
the
persian
ibex
wanders
wild
the
common
domestic
goat
is
a
very
different
animal
from
that
of
europe
and
has
peculiar
spiral
horns
of
the
same
pattern
as
the
markhor
another
grand
species
of
wild
goat
which
draws
eager
hunters
to
the
higher
reaches
of
the
same
mountains
from
this
it
would
appear
that
two
species
of
wild
goat
have
been
domesticated
and
kept
to
some
extent
distinct
one
eventually
finding
its
way
westward
but
not
eastward
and
southward
the
indian
humped
cattle
also
differ
so
widely
in
form
structure
and
voice
from
those
of
europe
that
there
can
scarcely
be
a
doubt
of
their
descent
from
distinct
species
but
both
have
entirely
disappeared
as
wild
animals
unless
indeed
the
white
cattle
of
chillingham
are
really
descendants
of
caesar
dreadful
urus
and
not
merely
domestic
cattle
lapsed
into
savagery
so
have
the
camel
and
with
a
similar
possible
exception
the
horse
was
the
whole
race
in
each
of
these
cases
subjugated
or
exterminated
and
that
by
uncivilised
man
with
his
primitive
weapons
there
is
no
analogy
here
with
the
extinction
of
such
animals
as
the
mammoth
for
the
ox
is
a
beast
in
every
way
fitted
to
live
and
thrive
in
the
present
condition
of
this
world
as
much
so
as
the
buffalo
and
the
indian
bison
which
show
no
sign
of
approaching
extinction
our
fathers
easily
got
rid
of
the
difficulty
by
assuming
that
noah
never
released
these
species
after
the
flood
but
what
shall
those
do
who
can
not
believe
in
the
literality
of
noah
ark
as
for
the
dog
its
domestication
has
been
the
creation
of
a
new
species
the
material
was
perhaps
the
wolf
more
likely
the
jackal
but
possibly
a
blend
of
more
than
one
species
but
a
dog
is
now
a
dog
and
neither
a
wolf
nor
a
jackal
a
mastiff
a
pug
a
collie
a
greyhound
a
pariah
all
recognise
each
other
and
observe
the
same
rules
of
etiquette
when
they
meet
we
must
admit
however
that
whatever
pliability
of
disposition
or
other
inherent
suitability
led
to
the
first
domestication
of
certain
species
of
animals
the
changes
induced
in
their
natures
by
many
generations
of
domesticity
have
made
them
amenable
to
man
control
to
a
degree
which
puts
a
wide
difference
between
them
and
their
wild
relations
a
wild
ass
though
brought
up
from
its
birth
in
a
stable
would
make
a
very
intractable
costermonger
moke
we
may
infer
from
this
that
the
first
subjugation
of
each
of
our
common
domestic
animals
was
the
achievement
of
some
genius
or
of
some
tribe
favourably
situated
and
that
they
spread
from
that
centre
by
sale
or
barter
rather
than
that
they
were
separately
domesticated
in
many
places
this
would
partly
explain
why
a
few
species
of
widely
different
families
are
so
universally
kept
in
all
countries
to
the
exclusion
of
hundreds
of
species
nearly
allied
and
apparently
as
suitable
when
a
want
could
be
supplied
by
obtaining
from
another
country
an
animal
bred
to
live
with
man
and
serve
him
the
long
and
difficult
task
of
softening
down
the
wild
instincts
of
a
beast
taken
from
the
forests
or
the
hills
and
acclimatising
its
constitution
to
a
domestic
life
was
not
likely
to
be
attempted
but
there
have
been
a
few
recent
additions
to
our
list
of
domestic
animals
the
turkey
and
the
guinea
fowl
are
examples
and
perhaps
within
another
generation
we
may
be
able
to
add
the
zebra
and
there
may
be
many
other
animals
fitted
to
enrich
and
adorn
human
life
which
would
make
no
insuperable
resistance
to
domestication
if
wisely
and
patiently
handled
here
is
a
noble
opening
for
carrying
out
in
its
kindest
sense
the
command
multiply
and
replenish
the
earth
and
subdue
it
and
have
dominion
over
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
over
the
fowl
of
the
air
and
over
every
living
thing
that
moveth
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
ix
snakes
i
have
met
persons
otherwise
quite
sane
who
told
me
that
they
would
like
to
visit
india
if
it
were
not
for
the
now
there
is
something
very
depressing
in
the
thought
that
this
state
of
mind
is
extant
in
england
for
it
is
calculated
on
occasion
to
have
results
of
a
most
melancholy
nature
by
way
of
example
let
us
picture
the
case
of
a
maiden
forced
to
reject
an
ardent
lover
because
duty
calls
him
to
a
land
where
there
are
snakes
think
of
his
happiness
blighted
for
ever
and
her
doomed
to
a
perpetual
maidenhood
harrowed
with
remorseful
dreams
of
the
hourly
perils
and
horrors
through
which
he
must
be
passing
without
her
and
dreading
to
enter
an
academy
or
lest
a
laocoon
or
a
fury
might
revive
apprehensions
too
horrible
to
be
borne
in
view
of
possibilities
so
dreadful
surely
it
is
a
duty
that
a
man
owes
to
his
kind
to
disseminate
the
truth
if
he
can
about
the
present
condition
in
the
east
of
that
reptile
which
crawling
on
its
belly
and
eating
dust
and
having
its
head
bruised
by
the
descendants
of
eve
sometimes
pays
off
her
share
of
the
curse
on
their
heels
here
the
truth
is
within
the
limits
of
our
indian
empire
including
burmah
and
ceylon
there
are
at
present
known
to
naturalists
two
hundred
and
species
of
snakes
of
these
are
which
never
leave
the
sea
and
could
not
if
they
would
the
remaining
two
hundred
and
species
comprise
samples
of
every
size
and
pattern
of
limbless
reptile
found
on
this
globe
from
the
gigantic
python
which
crushes
a
jackal
and
swallows
it
whole
to
the
little
burrowing
whose
proportions
are
those
of
an
earthworm
and
its
food
white
ants
if
you
have
made
up
your
mind
never
to
touch
a
snake
or
go
nearer
to
one
than
you
can
help
then
i
need
scarcely
tell
you
what
you
know
already
that
these
are
all
alike
hideous
and
repulsive
in
their
aspect
being
smeared
from
head
to
tail
with
a
viscous
and
venomous
slime
which
as
your
shakespeare
will
tell
you
leaves
a
trail
even
on
when
they
have
occasion
to
pass
over
such
this
preparation
would
appear
to
line
them
inside
as
well
as
out
for
there
is
no
lack
of
ancient
and
modern
testimony
to
the
fact
that
they
slaver
their
prey
all
over
before
swallowing
it
that
it
may
slide
the
more
easily
down
their
ghastly
throats
their
eye
is
cruel
and
stony
and
possesses
a
peculiar
property
known
as
fascination
which
places
their
victims
entirely
at
their
mercy
they
have
also
the
power
of
coiling
themselves
up
like
a
and
discharging
themselves
from
a
considerable
distance
at
those
whom
they
have
doomed
to
death
a
fact
which
is
attested
by
such
passages
in
the
poets
as
like
adder
darting
from
his
coil
and
by
travellers
this
is
the
true
faith
with
respect
to
all
serpents
and
if
you
are
resolved
to
remain
steadfast
in
it
you
may
do
so
even
in
india
for
it
is
possible
to
live
in
that
country
for
months
i
might
almost
say
years
without
ever
getting
a
sight
of
a
live
snake
except
in
the
basket
of
a
if
however
you
are
minded
to
cultivate
an
acquaintance
with
them
it
is
not
difficult
to
find
opportunities
of
doing
so
but
i
must
warn
you
that
it
will
be
with
jeopardy
to
your
faith
for
the
very
first
thing
that
will
strike
you
about
them
will
probably
be
their
cleanness
what
has
become
of
the
classical
slime
i
can
not
tell
but
it
is
a
fact
that
the
skin
of
a
modern
snake
is
always
delightfully
dry
and
clean
and
as
smooth
to
the
touch
as
velvet
the
next
thing
that
attracts
attention
is
their
beauty
not
so
much
the
beauty
of
their
colours
as
of
their
forms
with
few
exceptions
snakes
are
the
most
graceful
of
living
things
every
position
into
which
they
put
themselves
and
every
motion
of
their
perfectly
proportioned
forms
is
artistic
the
effect
of
this
is
enhanced
by
their
gentleness
and
the
softness
of
their
movements
but
if
you
want
to
see
them
properly
you
must
be
careful
not
to
frighten
them
for
there
is
no
creature
more
timid
at
heart
than
a
snake
one
will
sometimes
let
you
get
quite
near
to
it
and
watch
it
simply
because
it
does
not
notice
you
being
rather
deaf
and
very
shortsighted
but
when
it
does
discover
your
presence
its
one
thought
is
to
slip
away
quietly
and
hide
itself
it
is
on
account
of
this
extreme
timidity
that
we
see
them
so
seldom
of
the
two
hundred
and
kinds
that
i
have
referred
to
some
are
of
course
very
rare
or
only
found
in
particular
parts
of
the
country
but
at
least
forty
or
fifty
of
them
occur
everywhere
and
some
are
as
plentiful
as
crows
yet
they
keep
themselves
out
of
our
way
so
successfully
that
it
is
quite
a
rare
event
to
meet
with
one
occasionally
one
finds
its
way
into
a
house
in
quest
of
frogs
lizards
or
some
other
of
the
numerous
malefactors
that
use
our
dwellings
as
cities
of
refuge
from
the
avenger
and
it
is
discovered
by
the
hamal
behind
a
cupboard
or
under
a
carpet
he
does
the
one
thing
which
it
occurs
to
a
native
to
do
in
any
emergency
viz
raises
an
alarm
then
there
is
a
general
hubbub
servants
rush
together
with
the
longest
sticks
they
can
find
the
children
are
hurried
away
to
a
place
of
safety
the
master
appears
on
the
scene
armed
with
his
gun
and
the
wee
sleekit
cowrin
beastie
trying
to
slip
away
from
the
fuss
which
it
dislikes
so
much
is
headed
and
blown
or
battered
to
pieces
then
its
head
is
pounded
to
a
jelly
for
the
servants
are
agreed
that
if
this
precaution
is
omitted
it
will
revive
during
the
night
and
come
and
coil
itself
on
the
chest
of
its
murderer
finally
a
council
is
held
and
a
unanimous
resolution
recorded
that
deceased
was
a
serpent
of
the
deadliest
kind
this
is
not
a
lie
for
they
believe
it
but
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
it
is
an
untruth
of
our
two
hundred
and
kinds
of
snakes
only
are
ranked
by
naturalists
as
venomous
and
many
of
these
are
quite
incapable
of
killing
any
animal
as
large
as
a
man
others
are
very
rare
or
local
in
short
we
may
reckon
the
poisonous
snakes
with
which
we
have
any
practical
concern
at
four
kinds
and
the
chance
of
a
snake
found
in
the
house
belonging
to
one
of
these
kinds
stands
at
less
than
one
in
ten
it
is
a
sufficiently
terrible
thought
however
that
there
are
even
four
kinds
of
reptiles
going
silently
about
the
land
whose
bite
is
certain
death
if
they
knew
their
powers
and
were
maliciously
disposed
our
life
in
the
east
would
be
like
christian
progress
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
but
the
poisonous
snakes
are
just
as
timid
as
the
rest
and
as
little
inclined
to
act
on
the
offensive
against
any
living
creature
except
the
little
animals
on
which
they
prey
even
a
trodden
worm
will
turn
and
a
snake
has
as
much
spirit
as
a
worm
if
a
man
treads
on
it
it
will
turn
and
bite
him
but
it
has
no
desire
to
be
trodden
on
it
does
its
best
to
avoid
that
mischance
and
i
need
scarcely
say
so
does
a
man
unless
he
is
drunk
when
both
parties
are
sincerely
anxious
to
avoid
a
collision
a
collision
is
not
at
all
likely
to
occur
and
the
fact
is
that
of
all
forms
of
death
to
which
we
are
exposed
in
india
death
by
is
about
the
one
which
we
have
least
reason
to
apprehend
during
a
pretty
long
residence
in
india
i
have
heard
of
only
one
instance
of
an
englishman
being
killed
by
a
snake
it
was
in
manipur
and
i
read
of
it
in
the
newspapers
during
the
same
time
i
have
heard
of
only
one
death
by
lightning
and
one
by
falling
into
the
fermenting
vat
of
a
brewery
so
i
suppose
these
accidents
are
equally
uncommon
eating
oysters
is
much
more
fatal
i
have
heard
of
at
least
four
or
five
deaths
from
that
cause
the
natives
are
far
more
exposed
to
danger
from
snakes
than
we
are
because
they
go
barefoot
by
night
as
well
as
day
through
fields
and
along
narrow
overgrown
footpaths
about
their
villages
the
tread
of
a
barefooted
man
does
not
make
noise
enough
to
warn
a
snake
to
get
out
of
his
way
and
if
he
treads
on
one
there
is
nothing
between
its
fangs
and
his
skin
again
the
huts
of
the
natives
being
made
of
wattle
and
daub
and
thatched
with
straw
offer
to
snakes
just
the
kind
of
shelter
that
they
like
and
the
wonder
is
that
naked
men
sleeping
on
the
ground
in
such
places
and
poking
about
dark
corners
among
their
stores
of
fuel
and
other
chattels
meet
with
so
few
accidents
it
says
a
great
deal
for
the
mild
and
inoffensive
nature
of
the
snake
still
the
total
number
of
deaths
by
reported
every
year
is
very
large
and
looks
absolutely
appalling
if
you
do
not
think
of
dividing
it
among
three
hundred
millions
treated
in
that
way
it
shrivels
up
at
once
and
when
compared
with
the
results
of
other
causes
of
death
looks
quite
insignificant
the
natives
themselves
are
so
far
from
regarding
the
serpent
tribe
with
our
feelings
that
the
deadliest
of
them
all
has
been
canonised
and
is
treated
with
all
the
respect
due
to
a
no
brahmin
or
man
of
any
respectable
caste
will
have
a
cobra
killed
on
any
account
if
one
takes
to
haunting
his
premises
he
will
propitiate
it
with
offerings
of
silk
and
look
for
good
luck
from
its
patronage
about
snakes
other
than
the
cobra
the
average
native
concerns
himself
so
little
that
he
does
not
know
one
from
another
by
sight
they
are
all
classed
together
as
a
word
which
answers
exactly
to
the
venomous
beast
of
acts
xxviii
and
though
they
are
aware
that
some
are
deadly
and
some
are
not
any
particular
snake
that
a
has
had
the
honour
to
kill
is
one
of
the
deadliest
as
a
matter
of
course
i
have
never
met
a
native
who
knew
that
a
venomous
snake
could
be
distinguished
by
its
fangs
except
a
few
doctors
and
educated
men
who
have
imbibed
western
science
in
fact
they
do
not
think
of
the
venom
as
a
material
substance
situated
in
the
mouth
it
is
an
effluence
from
the
entire
animal
which
may
be
projected
at
a
man
in
various
ways
by
biting
him
or
spitting
at
him
or
giving
him
a
flick
with
the
tail
the
government
of
india
spends
a
large
sum
of
money
every
year
in
rewards
for
the
destruction
of
snakes
this
is
one
of
those
sacrifices
to
sentiment
which
every
prudent
government
offers
the
sentiment
to
which
respect
is
paid
in
this
case
is
of
course
british
not
indian
indian
sentiment
is
propitiated
by
not
levying
any
tax
on
dogs
so
the
pariah
cur
owned
and
disowned
in
all
stages
of
starvation
mange
and
disease
infests
every
town
and
village
lying
in
wait
for
the
bacillus
of
rabies
against
the
one
fatal
case
of
mentioned
above
i
have
known
of
at
least
half
a
dozen
deaths
among
englishmen
from
the
more
horrible
scourge
of
hydrophobia
in
the
steamer
which
brought
me
home
there
were
two
private
soldiers
on
their
way
to
pasteur
at
the
expense
of
course
of
the
british
government
x
the
indian
we
must
wait
for
another
month
or
two
before
we
can
think
of
the
winter
in
this
country
in
the
past
tense
but
in
india
the
month
of
march
is
the
beginning
of
the
hot
season
and
the
tourists
who
have
been
enjoying
the
pleasant
side
of
life
and
assuring
themselves
that
their
exiled
countrymen
have
not
much
to
grumble
at
will
now
be
making
haste
to
flee
during
the
month
the
various
hotels
of
bombay
will
be
pretty
familiar
with
the
grey
fortified
with
and
pendent
flap
which
is
the
sign
of
the
in
the
east
and
all
the
tribe
of
birds
of
prey
who
look
upon
him
as
their
lawful
spoil
will
recognise
the
sign
from
afar
and
gather
about
him
as
he
sits
in
the
balcony
after
breakfast
taking
his
last
view
of
the
gorgeous
east
and
perhaps
it
is
to
be
feared
seeking
inspiration
for
a
few
matured
reflections
wherewith
to
bring
the
forthcoming
book
to
an
impressive
close
the
vendor
of
delhi
jewellery
will
be
there
and
the
with
his
small
compressed
white
turban
and
spotless
robes
and
the
cashmere
shawl
merchant
and
many
more
pressing
on
the
notice
for
the
last
time
their
most
tempting
wares
and
preparing
for
the
long
bout
of
fence
which
will
decide
at
what
point
between
asking
price
and
selling
price
each
article
shall
change
ownership
the
distance
between
these
two
points
is
wide
and
variable
depending
upon
the
indications
of
wealth
about
the
purchaser
person
and
the
indications
of
innocence
about
his
countenance
and
when
the
poor
who
has
long
since
spent
more
money
than
he
ever
meant
to
spend
and
loaded
himself
with
things
which
he
could
have
got
cheaper
in
london
or
new
york
tries
to
shake
off
his
tormentors
by
getting
up
and
leaning
over
the
balcony
rails
the
shrill
voice
of
the
will
assail
him
from
below
promising
him
in
a
torrent
of
sonorous
hindustanee
variegated
with
pigeon
english
and
illuminated
with
wild
gesticulations
such
a
superfine
as
it
never
was
the
fortune
of
the
to
witness
before
is
one
of
those
indian
words
like
for
which
there
is
no
equivalent
in
the
english
language
and
which
are
at
once
so
comprehensive
and
so
expressive
that
when
once
the
use
of
them
has
been
acquired
they
become
indispensable
so
that
they
have
gained
a
permanent
place
in
the
vocabulary
it
is
not
slang
but
a
good
word
of
ancient
origin
quotes
a
curious
latin
writer
on
the
empire
of
the
grand
mogul
who
uses
it
with
a
definition
appended
ut
spectet
thamasham
id
est
pugnas
elephantorum
leonum
buffalorum
et
aliarura
ferarum
show
comes
nearest
it
in
english
but
falls
far
short
of
it
the
which
the
promises
the
will
include
serpent
dances
a
fight
between
a
cobra
and
a
mungoose
the
inevitable
mango
tree
and
other
tricks
of
juggling
but
to
a
stranger
the
himself
is
a
better
than
anything
he
can
show
he
is
indeed
a
most
extraordinary
animal
his
hair
and
beard
are
long
and
unkempt
his
general
aspect
wild
his
clothing
a
mixture
of
savagery
and
the
wreckage
of
civilisation
he
wears
a
turban
of
course
and
generally
a
large
one
but
it
is
put
on
without
art
just
wound
about
his
head
anyhow
and
hanging
lopsidedly
over
one
ear
it
and
the
loose
cloth
wrapped
about
the
middle
of
him
are
as
dirty
as
may
be
and
truly
oriental
though
erratic
but
besides
these
he
wears
a
jacket
of
coloured
calico
or
any
other
material
with
one
button
fastened
probably
on
the
wrong
buttonhole
and
under
this
if
the
weather
is
cold
he
may
have
a
shirt
seemingly
obtained
from
some
indian
representative
of
moses
on
his
shoulder
he
carries
a
long
bamboo
from
the
ends
of
which
hang
villainously
shabby
baskets
some
flat
and
round
occupied
by
snakes
others
large
and
oblong
filled
with
apparatus
of
jugglery
the
members
of
his
family
down
to
an
unclothed
precocious
imp
of
ten
accompany
him
carrying
similar
baskets
or
capacious
wallets
or
long
cylindrical
drums
on
which
they
play
with
their
fingers
the
dramatic
effect
of
the
whole
is
enhanced
when
one
of
them
allows
a
huge
python
a
snake
of
the
tribe
which
kills
its
prey
by
crushing
it
to
wind
its
hideous
speckled
coils
round
his
body
what
the
is
by
race
or
origin
ethnologists
may
determine
when
they
have
done
with
the
gipsy
he
is
not
a
hindu
no
particular
part
of
the
country
acknowledges
him
as
its
native
he
is
to
the
great
races
castes
and
creeds
of
india
what
the
waif
is
to
the
billows
of
the
sea
his
language
in
public
at
least
is
hindustanee
but
this
is
a
sort
of
the
common
property
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
his
religion
is
probably
one
of
the
many
forms
of
demon
worship
which
grow
rank
on
the
fringes
of
hinduism
he
must
be
classed
no
doubt
with
the
other
wandering
tribes
which
roam
the
country
camping
under
umbrellas
or
something
little
better
each
consecrated
to
some
particular
form
of
common
crime
and
each
professing
some
not
in
itself
dishonest
occupation
like
the
tinkering
of
gipsies
but
the
is
the
best
known
and
most
widely
spread
of
them
all
by
occupation
he
is
a
professor
of
three
occult
sciences
first
he
is
a
juggler
and
in
this
art
he
has
some
skill
his
masterpiece
is
the
famous
mango
trick
which
consists
in
making
a
miniature
mango
tree
grow
up
in
a
few
minutes
and
even
blossom
and
bear
fruit
out
of
some
bare
spot
which
he
has
covered
with
his
mysterious
basket
it
has
been
written
about
by
travellers
in
extravagant
terms
of
astonishment
and
admiration
but
as
generally
performed
is
an
extremely
trick
though
it
is
undoubtedly
difficult
to
guess
how
it
is
done
a
more
feat
is
to
put
the
unclothed
and
precocious
imp
aforementioned
under
a
large
basket
and
then
run
a
sword
savagely
through
and
through
every
corner
of
it
and
draw
it
out
covered
with
gore
when
the
sickened
spectators
are
about
to
lynch
the
murderer
the
imp
runs
in
smiling
from
the
garden
gate
the
connection
between
these
performances
and
the
man
second
trade
namely
is
not
obvious
to
a
western
mind
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
is
not
a
mere
vulgar
juggler
amusing
people
with
his
feats
are
miracles
performed
with
the
assistance
of
superior
powers
in
short
he
is
a
theosophist
only
his
converse
is
not
with
excorporated
mahatmas
from
thibet
but
with
spirits
of
another
grade
whose
superior
has
been
known
from
very
remote
antiquity
as
an
old
serpent
in
deference
to
this
respectable
connection
the
cobra
holds
a
distinguished
place
even
in
orthodox
hinduism
so
it
is
altogether
fit
that
a
performer
of
wonders
should
be
on
intimate
terms
with
the
serpent
tribe
the
keeps
all
sorts
of
them
but
chiefly
cobras
these
he
professes
to
charm
from
their
holes
by
playing
upon
an
instrument
which
may
have
some
hereditary
connection
with
the
bagpipe
for
it
has
an
consisting
of
a
large
gourd
and
it
makes
a
most
abominable
noise
as
soon
as
the
cobra
shows
itself
the
charmer
catches
it
by
the
tail
with
one
hand
and
running
the
other
swiftly
along
its
body
grips
it
firmly
just
behind
the
jaws
so
that
it
can
not
turn
and
bite
practice
and
coolness
make
this
an
easy
feat
then
the
poison
fangs
are
pulled
out
with
a
pair
of
forceps
and
the
cobra
is
quite
harmless
it
is
kept
in
a
round
flat
basket
out
of
which
when
the
charmer
removes
the
lid
and
begins
to
play
it
raises
its
graceful
head
and
expanding
its
hood
sways
gently
in
response
to
the
music
scientific
men
aver
that
a
snake
has
no
ears
and
can
not
possibly
hear
the
strains
of
the
pipe
but
that
sort
of
science
simply
spoils
a
picturesque
subject
like
the
so
much
is
certain
that
all
snakes
can
not
be
played
upon
in
this
way
there
are
some
species
which
are
utterly
callous
to
the
influences
to
which
the
cobra
yields
itself
so
readily
no
missionary
will
find
any
difficulty
in
getting
a
to
appreciate
that
scripture

about
the
deaf
adder
which
will
not

xi
cures
for
in
a
little
book
on
the
snakes
of
india
published
many
years
ago
by
nicholson
of
the
madras
medical
service
the
conviction
was
expressed
that
the
of
burmah
knew
of
some
antidote
to
the
poison
of
the
cobra
which
gave
them
confidence
in
handling
it
he
said
that
nothing
would
induce
them
to
divulge
it
but
that
he
suspected
it
consisted
in
gradual
inoculation
with
the
venom
itself
putting
the
question
to
himself
why
he
did
not
attempt
to
attest
this
by
experiment
he
replied
that
there
were
two
reasons
which
if
i
recollect
rightly
were
first
that
he
had
a
strong
natural
repugnance
to
anything
like
cruelty
to
animals
and
secondly
that
he
had
observed
that
as
soon
as
a
man
got
the
notion
into
his
head
that
he
had
discovered
a
cure
for
he
began
to
show
symptoms
of
insanity
it
is
rather
remarkable
that
after
so
many
years
another
scottish
doctor
not
in
madras
but
in
edinburgh
has
proved
by
just
such
experiments
as
nicholson
shrank
from
that
an
aged
and
previously
sedate
horse
may
by
gradual
inoculation
with
cobra
poison
be
rendered
so
thoroughly
proof
against
it
that
a
dose
which
would
suffice
to
kill
ten
ordinary
horses
only
imparts
increased
vigour
and
liveliness
to
it
further
fraser
has
found
that
the
serum
of
the
blood
of
an
animal
thus
rendered
proof
against
poison
is
itself
an
antidote
capable
of
combating
that
poison
after
it
has
been
at
work
for
thirty
minutes
in
the
veins
of
a
rabbit
and
arresting
its
effects
and
all
this
has
been
achieved
without
apparent
detriment
to
the
distinguished
doctor
sanity
this
must
be
intensely
interesting
intelligence
to
englishmen
throughout
india
and
joyful
intelligence
too
for
scoff
as
we
may
at
the
danger
of
being
bitten
by
a
poisonous
snake
nobody
likes
to
think
that
if
such
a
thing
happen
to
him
and
very
narrow
escapes
sometimes
remind
us
that
it
may
there
would
be
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
to
lie
down
and
die
and
so
ever
since
the
honourable
east
india
company
was
chartered
the
antidote
to
snake
poison
has
been
a
sort
of
stone
sought
after
by
doctors
and
men
of
science
along
many
lines
of
investigation
and
every
now
and
then
somebody
has
risen
up
and
announced
that
he
has
found
it
and
has
had
disciples
for
a
season
but
one
remedy
after
another
though
it
might
give
startling
results
in
the
laboratory
has
proved
to
be
useless
in
common
life
and
the
majority
of
englishmen
have
long
since
resigned
themselves
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
no
practical
cure
for
the
bite
of
a
poisonous
snake
for
what
avails
it
to
carry
about
in
your
travelling
bag
a
phial
of
strong
ammonia
and
to
live
in
more
jeopardy
of
death
by
asphyxiation
than
you
ever
were
by
snakes
unless
you
have
some
guarantee
that
when
it
is
your
fate
to
be
bitten
by
a
snake
the
phial
will
be
at
hand
for
ammonia
must
act
on
the
venom
before
the
venom
has
had
time
to
act
upon
you
or
it
will
only
add
another
pain
to
your
end
and
that
gives
only
a
few
minutes
to
go
upon
so
with
nitric
acid
and
every
agent
that
operates
by
neutralising
the
poison
and
not
by
counteracting
its
effects
and
this
has
been
the
character
of
all
the
remedies
hitherto
put
forward
they
are
says
sir
joseph
fayrer
absolutely
without
any
specific
effect
on
the
condition
produced
by
the
poison
but
as
fraser
calls
his
immunised
follows
the
poison
into
the
system
even
after
the
fatal
symptoms
have
begun
to
show
themselves
and
arrests
them
at
once
so
the
may
throw
away
his
ammonia
phial
and
arming
himself
with
another
of
and
a
hypodermic
syringe
feel
that
he
is
safe
against
an
accident
which
will
never
happen
as
for
the
man
who
is
not
nervous
he
will
speak
of
the
new
antidote
and
think
of
it
as
most
interesting
and
valuable
and
go
on
his
way
as
before
with
no
expectation
of
ever
being
bitten
by
a
venomous
snake
the
medical
man
of
every
degree
will
order
a
supply
as
soon
as
it
is
to
be
had
and
conscientiously
try
to
stamp
out
the
smouldering
hope
within
him
that
somebody
in
the
station
will
soon
be
bitten
by
a
cobra
and
give
him
a
chance
among
the
dusky
millions
of
india
fraser
discovery
will
create
no
catholic
ravishment
because
they
will
not
hear
of
it
and
if
they
did
hear
of
it
they
would
regard
his
labours
as
misapplied
and
the
result
as
superfluous
for
the
hindu
has
never
shared
the
englishman
opinion
that
there
is
no
cure
for
on
the
contrary
he
is
assured
that
there
are
not
one
or
two
but
many
specifics
for
the
bite
of
every
kind
of
snake
known
to
those
whose
business
it
is
to
know
them
if
they
are
not
invariably
efficacious
it
is
for
the
simple
reason
that
if
a
man
time
has
come
to
die
he
will
die
but
if
his
time
has
not
come
to
die
they
will
not
fail
to
cure
him
and
since
no
man
can
know
when
he
is
bitten
whether
his
time
has
come
or
not
he
will
lay
the
odds
against
fate
by
trying
not
one
or
another
of
them
but
as
many
as
he
can
hear
of
or
get
some
of
them
are
drastic
in
their
effects
and
so
it
too
often
proves
that
the
poor
man
time
has
indeed
come
for
though
he
might
survive
the
snake
he
succumbs
to
the
cure
it
is
many
years
now
since
the
news
was
brought
to
me
one
day
that
a
man
whom
i
knew
very
well
had
been
bitten
by
a
deadly
serpent
and
was
dying
he
was
a
fine
strongly
built
young
fellow
a
mohammedan
in
the
employ
of
a
parsee
liquor
distiller
in
whose
godown
he
was
arranging
firewood
when
he
was
bitten
in
the
foot
without
looking
at
the
snake
he
rushed
out
and
falling
on
his
face
on
the
ground
implored
the
bystanders
to
take
care
of
his
wife
and
children
as
he
was
a
dead
man
the
news
spread
and
all
the
village
ran
together
the
man
was
taken
to
an
open
room
in
his
employer
premises
and
vigorous
measures
for
his
recovery
were
set
on
foot
in
which
his
employer
family
and
servants
his
own
friends
and
as
many
of
the
general
public
as
chose
to
look
in
were
allowed
to
take
part
first
of
all
some
jungle
men
were
called
in
for
the
man
of
the
jungle
must
naturally
know
more
about
snakes
than
other
men
these
were
probably
katkurrees
an
aboriginal
race
who
live
by
woodcutting
hunting
and
other
sylvan
occupations
they
proved
to
be
practical
men
and
at
once
sucked
the
wound
an
intelligent
havildar
of
the
customs
department
who
chanced
to
be
present
then
lanced
the
wound
slightly
to
let
the
blood
flow
and
tied
the
leg
tightly
in
two
places
above
it
this
was
admirable
if
what
the
jungle
men
and
the
havildar
did
were
always
and
promptly
done
whenever
a
man
is
bitten
by
a
snake
few
such
accidents
would
end
fatally
but
this
poor
man
friends
did
not
stop
there
a
supply
of
chickens
had
been
procured
with
all
haste
and
these
were
scientifically
applied
this
is
a
remedy
in
which
the
natives
have
great
faith
and
i
have
known
europeans
who
were
convinced
of
its
efficacy
the
manner
of
its
application
scarcely
admits
of
description
in
these
pages
but
the
effect
is
that
the
chickens
absorb
the
poison
and
die
while
the
man
lives
the
number
of
chickens
required
is
a
gauge
of
the
virulence
of
the
serpent
for
as
soon
as
the
venom
is
all
extracted
they
cease
to
die
nobody
however
could
tell
me
how
many
chickens
perished
in
this
case
they
were
all
too
busy
to
stop
and
note
the
result
of
one
remedy
while
another
remained
untried
and
there
were
many
yet
somebody
suggested
that
the
venom
should
be
dislodged
from
the
stomach
so
an
emetic
was
administered
in
the
form
of
a
handful
of
common
salt
with
immediate
and
seismic
effect
then
a
decoction
of
leaves
was
poured
down
the
man
throat
the
tree
is
an
enemy
of
all
fevers
and
a
friend
of
man
generally
so
much
so
that
it
is
healthful
to
sleep
under
its
shade
therefore
a
decoction
of
the
leaves
could
not
fail
to
be
beneficial
in
one
way
or
another
the
residue
of
the
leaves
was
well
rubbed
into
the
crown
of
the
man
head
for
more
direct
effect
on
the
brains
in
case
they
might
be
affected
something
else
was
rubbed
in
under
the
root
of
the
tongue
in
the
meantime
a
man
with
some
experience
in
exorcism
had
brought
twigs
of
a
tree
of
potency
in
expelling
the
devil
and
advised
that
in
view
of
the
known
connection
between
serpents
and
satan
it
would
be
well
to
try
beating
the
patient
with
these
the
advice
was
taken
and
many
stripes
were
laid
upon
him
massage
was
also
tried
and
other
homely
expedients
such
as
bandaging
and
thumping
with
the
fists
were
not
neglected
it
was
about
noon
when
i
was
told
of
the
accident
and
i
went
down
at
once
and
found
the
poor
man
in
a
woeful
state
as
well
he
might
be
after
such
rough
handling
as
he
had
suffered
for
four
consecutive
hours
but
he
was
quite
conscious
and
there
was
neither
pain
nor
swelling
in
the
bitten
foot
i
remonstrated
most
vigorously
pointing
out
that
the
snake
which
nobody
had
seen
might
not
have
been
a
venomous
one
at
all
that
there
were
no
symptoms
of
poisoning
except
such
as
might
also
be
explained
by
the
treatment
the
man
had
suffered
at
the
hands
of
his
friends
and
that
in
short
i
could
see
no
reason
to
think
he
was
going
to
die
unless
they
were
determined
to
kill
him
my
words
appeared
to
produce
a
good
effect
on
the
parsees
at
least
and
they
consented
to
stop
curing
the
man
and
let
him
rest
giving
him
such
stimulating
refreshment
as
he
would
take
for
he
was
a
pious
mussulman
and
would
not
touch
wine
or
spirits
i
said
what
i
could
to
cheer
him
up
and
went
away
hoping
that
i
had
saved
a
human
life
alas
in
an
hour
or
so
a
friend
came
in
with
a
root
of
rare
virtue
and
persuaded
the
man
to
swallow
some
preparation
of
it
whether
i
dare
not
say
he
became
unconscious
and
sank
before
night
he
was
buried
all
this
did
not
happen
in
some
obscure
village
in
a
remote
jungle
it
happened
within
a
mile
and
a
half
of
a
town
controlled
by
a
municipal
corporation
which
enjoys
the
rights
and
privileges
of
local
in
that
town
there
was
a
dispensary
with
a
very
capable
in
charge
and
in
that
dispensary
i
doubt
not
you
would
have
found
a
bottle
of
strong
and
a
printed
copy
of
the
directions
issued
by
a
paternal
government
for
the
recovery
of
persons
bitten
by
venomous
serpents
but
when
the
man
was
bitten
the
one
thing
which
occurred
to
nobody
was
to
take
him
there
and
when
i
heard
of
the
matter
the
had
just
left
for
a
distant
place
passing
on
his
way
the
gate
of
the
house
in
which
the
man
lay
this
was
a
bad
case
but
there
is
little
reason
to
hope
that
it
was
altogether
exceptional
i
am
afraid
there
can
be
no
question
at
all
that
hundreds
of
the
deaths
put
down
to
by
village
punchayets
every
year
might
with
more
truth
be
registered
as
cured
to
death
xii
the

a
story
of
a
moneylender
beharil
surajmul
was
the
greatest
moneylender
in
dowlutpoor
he
was
a
man
of
rare
talents
he
remembered
the
face
of
every
man
who
had
at
any
time
come
to
borrow
money
of
him
since
he
began
to
work
as
a
little
boy
in
his
father
office
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
deceive
him
he
had
also
such
a
miraculous
skill
in
the
making
out
of
accounts
that
a
poor
man
who
had
come
to
him
in
extremity
for
a
loan
of
fifty
rupees
to
meet
the
expenses
of
his
daughter
marriage
might
go
on
making
payments
for
the
remainder
of
his
life
without
reducing
the
debt
by
one
rupee
in
fact
it
seemed
to
increase
with
each
payment
and
if
the
matter
went
into
court
beharilal
never
failed
to
show
that
there
was
still
a
balance
due
to
him
much
larger
than
the
original
loan
but
so
courteous
and
pleasant
was
the
seth
in
his
manner
to
all
that
such
matters
never
went
into
court
until
the
right
time
of
which
he
was
an
infallible
judge
for
he
knew
the
private
affairs
of
every
family

the
purchaser
though
not
of
course
in
his
own
name
for
he
was
a
prudent
man
by
these
means
beharilal
had
become
possessed
of
large
estates
which
he
managed
with
such
skill
that
they
yielded
to
him
revenues
which
they
had
never
yielded
to
the
former
owners
of
them
while
his
tenants
who
were
mostly
former
owners
grew
daily
more
deeply
involved
in
their
pecuniary
obligations
to
him
and
therefore
entertained
no
thought
of
leaving
him
for
he
could
put
them
into
prison
any
day
if
he
chose
their
contentment
gave
him
great
satisfaction
and
he
treated
them
with
benevolence
giving
them
advances
of
money
for
all
their
necessary
expenses
and
appropriating
the
whole
of
their
crops
at
the
harvest
to
repay
himself
he
bound
them
to
buy
all
that
they
had
need
of
at
his
shop
so
that
he
made
profit
off
them
on
both
sides
and
as
his
wealth
increased
his
person
increased
with
it
and
his
appearance
became
more
imposing
so
that
he
was
regarded
everywhere
with
the
highest
respect
and
esteem
he
was
moreover
a
very
religious
man
and
charitable
beyond
most
by
early
risers
he
might
be
seen
in
his
garden
seeking
out
the
nests
of
ants
and
giving
them
with
his
own
hands
their
daily
dole
of
rice
it
was
his
benevolent
thoughtfulness
which
had
supplied
drinking
troughs
for
the
flocks
of
pigeons
that
continually
plundered
the
stores
of
the
other
grain
merchants
he
had
also
established
a
pinjrapole
for
aged
sickly
and
ownerless
animals
of
all
kinds
to
this
he
required
all
his
tenants
to
send
their
bullocks
when
they
became
unfit
for
work
and
he
sold
them
new
cattle
good
and
strong
at
prices
fixed
by
himself
if
any
of
his
old
debtors
when
reduced
to
beggary
came
to
his
door
for
alms
they
were
never
sent
away
without
a
handful
of
rice
or
a
copper
coin
he
kept
a
bag
of
the
smallest
copper
coins
always
at
hand
for
such
purposes
beharilal
had
a
fine
house
designed
by
himself
and
surrounded
by
a
vast
garden
stocked
with
mangoes
guavas
custard
apples
oranges
and
other
fruit
trees
and
made
beautiful
and
fragrant
with
all
manner
of
flowers
the
cool
shade
drew
together
birds
of
many
kinds
from
the
dry
plains
of
the
surrounding
country
and
it
pleased
beharilal
to
think
that
they
also
were
recipients
of
his
bounty
and
that
the
benefits
which
he
conferred
on
them
would
certainly
be
entered
to
the
credit
of
his
account
with
heaven
some
he
fed
such
as
the
crows
which
flocked
about
the
back
door
like
a
convocation
of
christian
padres
in
the
morning
and
afternoon
when
the
ladies
of
his
family
gave
out
their
portion
of
boiled
rice
and
ghee
the
pigeons
also
came
together
in
hundreds
in
an
open
space
under
the
shade
of
a
noble
peepul
tree
where
grain
was
thrown
out
for
them
at
three
every
day
and
among
them
were
many
chattering
sparrows
and
not
a
few
green
parrots
which
walked
quaintly
among
the
bustling
pigeons
their
long
tails
moving
from
side
to
side
like
the
pointer
of
the
scale
on
which
the
bunia
weighed
his
rupees
this
resemblance
struck
him
as
he
reclined
against
the
fat
red
cushion
in
his
verandah
summing
up
his
gains
there
were
other
birds
which
would
not
eat
his
food
but
found
abundance
suited
to
their
respective
castes
among
the
shrubs
and
trees
that
he
had
planted
mynas
walked
eagerly
on
the
lawns
looking
for
grasshoppers
glittering
sunbirds
hovered
over
the
flowers
thrusting
their
slender
bills
into
each
blossom
bulbuls
twittered
among
the
mulberries
and
the
koel
made
the
shady
banian
tree
resound
with
its
melodious
notes
in
a
remote
corner
of
the
garden
under
the
dark
shade
of
a
tamarind
there
stood
a
small
shrine
like
a
whitewashed
tomb
with
a
niche
or
recess
on
one
side
of
it
containing
a
conical
stone
smeared
with
red
ochre
some
called
it
mahadeo
and
some
khandoba
but
no
one
could
explain
the
presence
of
a
mahratta
god
in
a
bunia
garden
in
dowlutpoor
except
by
quoting
an
old
tradition
about
one
narayen
who
had
come
from
the
mahratta
country
and
lived
for
many
years
in
this
place
some
said
he
was
a
prosperous
goldsmith
of
great
piety
but
others
maintained
that
he
was
a
sunyasee
or
saint
and
there
was
no
certainty
in
the
matter
the
one
point
on
which
all
were
agreed
was
the
great
sanctity
of
the
shrine
and
beharilal
was
most
careful
to
perform
at
it
every
ceremony
which
custom
or
tradition
sanctioned
for
placating
the
god
and
averting
any
calamity
that
might
arise
from
his
displeasure
at
the
base
of
one
of
the
old
cracked
walls
of
the
shrine
there
was
a
hole
which
was
the
den
of
a
very
large
black
cobra
several
times
it
had
been
seen
in
the
garden
and
when
pursued
had
glided
into
this
hole
and
escaped
when
beharilal
first
heard
of
it
he
was
much
troubled
in
his
mind
but
having
consulted
a
brahmin
he
gave
strict
injunctions
that
the
reptile
should
not
be
molested
and
since
that
time
he
had
never
failed
to
place
an
offering
of
milk
near
to
the
hole
in
the
morning
and
in
the
evening
now
it
happened
that
at
this
time
there
was
in
dowlutpoor
an
english
doctor
who
was
generally
known
as
the
saheb
because
he
was
believed
to
practise
sorcery
and
had
some
mysterious
need
of
snakes
perhaps
he
was
only
making
experiments
with
their
venom
at
any
rate
he
wanted
live
cobras
and
offered
a
good
price
for
them
so
when
nagoo
the
heard
that
there
was
a
large
one
in
beharilal
garden
he
thought
he
might
do
good
business
by
capturing
it
for
the
saheb
and
at
the
same
time
demanding
a
reward
from
the
timorous
bunia
for
ridding
him
of
such
a
dangerous
neighbour
with
this
intent
he
repaired
to
the
garden
with
all
the
apparatus
of
his
art
his
flat
snake
baskets
his
mongoose
and
his
crooked
pipe
having
reconnoitred
the
ground
he
commenced
operations
by
sitting
down
on
his
hams
and
producing
such
strains
from
the
crooked
pipe
as
might
have
charmed
cerberus
to
leave
his
kennel
at
the
gate
of
hell
great
was
his
surprise
and
mortification
when
he
heard
the
voice
of
beharilal
raised
in
tones
of
unwonted
passion
and
saw
a
stalwart
purdaisee
advancing
towards
him
armed
with
an
lathee
who
without
ceremony
nay
with
abusive
epithets
hustled
him
and
all
his
gear
out
of
the
garden
nagoo
was
a
and
by
nature
a
gipsy
and
this
treatment
rankled
in
his
dark
bosom
some
weeks
passed
and
the
sun
had
scarcely
risen
when
beharilal
sat
in
the
ota
in
front
of
his
house
at
his
daily
business
which
began
as
soon
as
his
teeth
were
cleaned
and
ended
about
eleven
at
night
the
place
was
not
tidy
two
or
three
mats
were
spread
on
the
floor
a
spare
one
was
rolled
up
in
a
corner
several
pairs
of
shoes
were
on
the
steps
umbrellas
leaned
against
the
wall
handles
downwards
and
a
large
chatty
of
drinking
water
stood
beside
them
the
bunia
himself
and
sat
on
a
cushion
with
a
wooden
stool
in
front
of
him
on
which
lay
an
open
ledger
of
stout
yellowish
paper
bound
in
soft
red
leather
and
nearly
two
feet
in
length
in
this
he
was
carefully
entering
yesterday
transactions
with
a
reed
pen
which
he
dipped
frequently
in
a
brass
inkpot
filled
with
a
sponge
soaked
in
a
muddy
black
fluid
beside
him
sat
his
son
aged
two
years
playing
with
the
red
lacquered
cylinder
in
which
he
kept
his
reed
pens
beharilal
had
two
girls
also
but
they
were
with
the
women
folk
in
the
interior
of
the
house
where
he
was
content
they
should
stay
this
was
his
only
boy
the
pride
and
joy
of
his
heart
engrossed
as
he
was
in
recording
his
gains
he
could
not
refrain
from
lifting
his
eyes
now
and
again
to
feast
them
on
that
rotund
little
body
like
a
goblet
set
on
two
pillars
no
clothing
concealed
the
tense
and
shiny
brown
skin
but
there
were
silver
bracelets
on
the
fat
wrists
and
massive
anklets
where
deep
creases
divided
the
fat
little
feet
from
the
fat
little
legs
and
a
representation
in
chased
silver
of
eve
fig
leaf
hung
from
a
silver
chain
which
encircled
the
sphere
that
should
have
been
his
waist
his
globular
head
was
curiously
shaven
from
two
deep
pits
between
the
bulging
brow
and
the
fat
cheeks
that
nearly
squeezed
out
the
little
nose
between
them
two
black
diamonds
twinkled
full
of
wonder
as
the
small
purse
mouth
prattled
to
itself
softly
and
inarticulately
of
the
mysteries
of
life
suddenly
a
startled
cry
passing
into
a
prolonged
wail
of
fear
roused
old
beharilal
and
he
saw
a
sight
that
nearly
caused
him
to
swoon
with
terror
the
little
man
a
moment
ago
so
placid
and
happy
was
shrinking
back
with
i
do
like
that
thing
inscribed
in
lines
of
anguish
on
his
distorted
face
and
not
three
feet
from
him
a
huge
cobra
just
emerged
from
the
roll
of
matting
eyed
him
with
a
stony
stare
its
head
raised
and
its
hood
expanded
its
quivering
tongue
flickered
out
from
between
its
lips
like
distant
flashes
of
forked
lightning
for
a
moment
beharilal
stood
stupefied
then
all
the
heroism
that
was
in
him
spent
itself
at
once
seizing
the
heavy
wooden
stool
in
both
his
hands
he
raised
it
high
over
his
head
and
dashed
it
down
on
the
reptile
the
sharp
edge
of
hard
wood
broke
its
back
and
as
it
wriggled
and
lashed
about
biting
at
everything
within
reach
the
bunia
snatched
up
his
boy
and
waddled
into
the
house
at
a
pace
to
which
he
had
long
been
unaccustomed
calling
out
in
frantic
gasps
for
help
a
rush
of
excited
and
screaming
women
met
him
in
the
inner
court
and
he
dropped
his
precious
burden
with
pious
ejaculations
into
the
arms
of
its
mother
and
stood
panting
and
speechless
then
calling
aloud
to
know
if
all
danger
was
past
he
ventured
cautiously
out
again
and
saw
that
the
purdaisee
and
the
malee
had
ejected
the
wriggling
cobra
and
were
pounding
its
head
into
a
jelly
with
a
big
stone
for
some
seconds
he
looked
on
in
a
strange
stupor
and
then
he
realised
what
he
had
done
he
beharilal
the
bunia
who
had
always
removed
the
insects
so
tenderly
from
his
own
person
that
they
were
not
hurt
who
had
never
committed
the
sin
of
killing
a
mosquito
or
a
fly
he
with
his
own
hands
had
taken
the
life
of
the
guardian
cobra
of
the
shrine
he
cried
for
what
demerit
of
mine
has
this
befallen
me
in
my
old
age
what
will
happen
now
nay
sethjkee
said
the
malee
be
not
afraid
it
was
in
your
destiny
that
this
offspring
of
satan
should
come
to
its
end
by
your
hand
we
have
pounded
its
head
properly
so
it
will
not
return
to
you
but
what
of
its
mate
said
beharilal
i
have
heard
that
if
any
man
kills
a
cobra
its
mate
will
follow
him
by
day
and
by
night
until
it
has
had
its
revenge
is
that
not
so
the
malee
answered
chh
chh
there
is
no
mate
of
this
cobra
but
his
tone
was
not
confident
go
cried
beharilal
go
quickly
and
call
nagoo
the
he
has
knowledge
i
will
go
said
the
malee
and
set
off
at
a
run
but
when
he
got
out
of
the
gate
he
lapsed
into
a
leisurely
walk
for
why
should
a
man
lose
his
breath
without
cause
in
time
he
found
his
way
to
the
little
settlement
of
huts
constructed
of
poles
and
mats
where
nagoo
sat
on
the
ground
smoking
his
chillum
and
told
his
errand
why
should
i
come
was
nagoo
reply
i
went
to
take
away
that
cobra
and
the
bunia
drove
me
from
the
garden
with
abuse
why
does
he
send
for
me
now
he
is
a
bunia
said
the
malee
as
if
that
summed
up
the
whole
matter
but
he
added
after
a
pause
if
he
sees
a
burning
ground
he
shakes
like
a
peepul
leaf
the
cobra
has
died
by
his
hand
and
his
liver
has
become
like
water
whatever
you
ask
he
will
give
you
should
come
nagoo
replied
aloud
i
will
come
and
to
himself
i
will
give
him
physic
then
he
took
up
his
baskets
and
his
pipe
and
followed
the
malee
beharilal
proceeded
to
business
with
a
directness
foreign
to
his
habit
looking
over
his
shoulder
at
intervals
lest
a
snake
might
be
silently
approaching
good
nagoo
he
said
a
great
misfortune
has
happened
the
cobra
of
the
shrine
has
been
killed
has
it
a
mate
how
can
a
cobra
not
have
a
mate
answered
nagoo
curtly
then
beharilal
employed
the
most
insinuating
of
the
many
tones
of
his
voice
listen
nagoo
you
are
a
man
of
skill
capture
that
cobra
and
i
will
pay
you
well
i
will
give
you
five
rupees
then
observing
no
response
in
the
wrinkled
visage
of
the
charmer
i
will
give
you
ten
rupees
nagoo
would
have
sold
his
revenge
for
a
tithe
of
the
wealth
thus
dangled
before
him
but
he
saw
no
reason
to
suppose
that
there
was
another
cobra
anywhere
in
the
garden
so
he
answered
with
the
calm
confidence
of
an
expert
that
can
not
be
done
the
serpent
will
not
heed
any
pipe
now
in
its
mind
there
is
only
revenge
then
what
will
it
do
said
the
trembling
bunia
if
its
mate
died
by
the
hand
of
a
man
it
will
follow
that
man
until
it
has
accomplished
its
purpose
but
how
will
it
know
asked
beharilal
by
whose
hand
its
mate
died
nagoo
replied
with
pious
simplicity
how
can
i
tell
by
what
means
it
knows
god
informs
it
but
pleaded
beharilal
is
there
no
escape
if
a
man
goes
away
by
the
railway
or
by
water
nagoo
pondered
for
a
moment
and
said
if
a
man
crossed
the
sea
the
serpent
would
be
baulked
if
he
goes
by
railway
it
will
not
leave
him
let
him
go
to
madras
it
will
find
him
with
a
faltering
hand
the
bunia
put
some
rupees
uncounted
into
the
charmer
skinny
palm
saying
go
make
incantations
do
something
there
is
great
knowledge
of
mysteries
with
you
and
he
hurried
back
into
the
house
his
arrangements
were
very
soon
made
his
account
books
with
a
bundle
of
bonds
and
hoondies
and
cash
and
his
son
were
put
into
a
small
cart
drawn
by
a
pair
of
fast
trotting
bullocks
into
which
he
himself
climbed
after
looking
under
the
cushion
to
see
that
there
was
no
evil
beast
lurking
there
and
got
away
in
haste
while
the
sun
was
yet
hot
the
rest
of
the
family
followed
with
the
household
property
and
in
a
few
days
the
house
was
empty
and
only
the
malee
remained
in
charge
many
years
have
passed
and
the
house
is
empty
still
and
the
malee
grown
grey
and
frail
is
still
in
charge
he
gets
no
wages
but
he
sells
the
jasmine
flowers
and
the
mangoes
and
guavas
and
he
grows
chillies
and
brinjals
and
so
fills
the
stomachs
of
himself
and
his
little
grandson
and
is
contented
if
you
ask
him
where
the
seth
has
gone
he
replies
who
knows
his
debt
has
gone
with
his
creditor
gone
glimmering
through
the
dream
of
things
that
were
and
he
has
no
desire
to
recall
them
a
civil
or
military
officer
from
the
station
taking
a
solitary
walk
sometimes
finds
himself
at
the
cobra
bungalow
and
turns
in
to
wander
among
its
old
trees
and
unswept
paths
obstructed
by
overgrown
and
untended
shrubs
and
wonders
how
it
got
its
name
then
he
pauses
at
the
whitewashed
shrine
and
notes
that
the
has
been
freshly
painted
red
and

of

lie
before

but
the
old
malee
approaches
with
a
meek
salaam
and
a
posy
of
jasmine
and
marigolds
and
warns
him
that

xiii
the
panther
i
did
not
shoot
it
was
january
of
a
good
many
years
ago
in
those
happy
days
that
have
gone
glimmering
through
the
dream
of
things
that
were
the
sun
had
scarcely
risen
and
i
was
sitting
in
the
cosy
cabin
of
my
yacht
enjoying
my
chota
hazree
which
being
interpreted
means
lesser
presence
and
in
speech
signifies
an
of
tea
and
toast
the
greater
presence
appears
some
hours
later
and
we
call
it
breakfast
i
will
not
say
that
the
view
from
my
cabin
windows
was
enchanting
the
placid
waters
of
the
broad
creek
would
have
been
pleasant
to
look
upon
if
the
level
rays
of
the
sun
in
his
strength
had
not
skimmed
them
with
such
a
blinding
glare
but
the
low
hills
that
bounded
them
were
forbidding
the
people
said
truly
that
god
had
made
this
a
country
of
stones
but
they
forgot
that
he
had
clothed
the
stones
with
trees
of
evergreen
foliage
and
a
dense
undergrowth
of
shrubs
and
grass
to
protect
and
hold
together
the
thick
bed
of
loam
which
the
fallen
leaves
enriched
from
year
to
year
it
was
the
axes
of
their
fathers
that
felled
the
trees
to
sell
for
fuel
and
the
billhooks
of
their
mothers
that
hacked
away
the
bushes
and
grubbed
up
their
very
roots
to
burn
on
the
household
cooking
hole
then
the
torrential
rains
of
the
monsoon
came
down
on
the
naked
defenceless
parched
and
cracked
soil
and
swept
it
in
muddy
cascades
down
to
the
sea
leaving
flats
of
bare
rock
strewn
thick
with
round
stones
sore
to
the
foot
of
man
and
cruel
to
the
hoofs
of
a
horse
about
and
among
the
huts
of
the
unswept
and
malodorous
hamlet
just
above
the
shore
there
were
fine
trees
mango
tamarind
babool
and
bor
showing
what
might
have
been
elsewhere
on
the
rounded
top
of
the
highest
hill
frowned
in
black
ruin
an
old
mahratta
fort
covered
on
the
top
and
sides
and
choked
within
by
that
dense
mass
of
struggling
vegetation
which
always
takes
possession
of
old
forts
in
india
the
stones
and
crumbling
mortar
seem
to
feed
the
trees
to
gluttony
first
some
the
seeds
of
the
banian
fig
into
crevices
of
the
ramparts
and
its
insidious
roots
push
their
way
and
grow
and
grow
into
great
tortuous
snakes
embracing
the
massive
blocks
of
basalt
heaving
them
up
and
holding
them
up
so
that
they
can
not
fall
then
prickly
shrubs
and
thorny
trees
follow
fighting
for
every
inch
of
ground
but
quite
unable
to
eject
the
gently
persistent
descended
doubtless
from
seeds
which
the
garrison
dropped
as
they
ate
the
luscious
fruit
on
account
of
which
the
portuguese
introduced
the
tree
from
south
america
i
had
penetrated
into
that
fort
and
had
seen
something
of
the
snakes
and
birds
of
night
but
not
the
ghosts
and
demons
which
i
was
assured
made
it
their
habitation
by
day
on
a
level
place
a
little
below
the
fort
stood
two
monuments
telling
of
the
days
when
the
honourable
east
india
company
maintained
a
resident
at
this
place
here
he
lived
in
proud
solitude
upholding
the
british
flag
but
his
wife
and
the
little
one
on
whose
face
he
had
not
yet
looked
were
on
their
way
from
bombay
in
a
native
pattimar
to
join
him
and
as
he
stood
gazing
over
the
sea
at
the
red
setting
sun
one
of
october
he
thought
of
the
glad
and
the
end
of
his
dreary
loneliness
it
fell
to
him
to
put
up
one
of
these
monuments
with
a
sorrowful
inscription
to
all
that
was
left
to
him
on
the
following
morning
the
memory
of
a
beloved
wife
and
an
infant
days
old
drowned
in
crossing
the
bar
on
october
we
have
strewed
our
best
to
the
weeds
unrest
to
the
shark
and
the
sheering
gull
if
blood
be
the
price
of
admiralty
lord
god
we
ha
paid
in
full
i
carried
my
gun
and
rifle
with
me
in
my
yacht
they
served
to
keep
up
my
character
as
a
sportsman
and
did
not
often
require
to
be
cleaned
so
the
morning
calm
of
my
mind
was
lashed
into
an
unwonted
tempest
of
excitement
when
my
jolly
skipper
sheikh
abdul
rehman
came
in
and
told
me
briefly
that
a
bag
which
word
does
not
rhyme
with
rag
but
must
be
pronounced
like
barg
without
the
and
signifies
a
tiger
or
panther
had
killed
a
cow
in
the
village
the
night
before
last
when
he
added
that
the
villagers
had
set
a
spring
gun
for
it
last
evening
and
it
had
returned
to
the
kill
and
been
badly
wounded
my
excitement
was
turned
into
wrath
i
had
been
at
anchor
here
all
yesterday
the
indian
ryot
everywhere
turns
instinctively
to
the
as
his
protector
against
all
wild
beasts
what
did
these
men
mean
by
keeping
their
own
counsel
and
setting
an
infernal
machine
for
their
enemy
abdul
rehman
explained
and
the
explanation
was
simple
and
sufficient
my
fat
predecessor
in
the
appointment
that
i
held
had
no
relish
for
sport
and
kept
no
guns
so
the
simple
villagers
when
they
saw
my
boat
with
its
familiar
flag
looked
for
no
help
from
that
quarter
however
i
might
still
win
renown
off
that
wounded
bag
if
it
was
not
a
myth
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
sceptical
the
tiger
and
the
panther
are
not
nomads
on
rocky
plains
like
the
antelope
i
landed
notwithstanding
promptly
and
visited
the
scene
sure
enough
there
was
a
young
heifer
lying
on
its
side
with
the
unmistakable
deep
pits
where
the
jaws
of
the
panther
had
gripped
its
throat
and
a
gory
cavity
where
it
had
selected
a
gigot
for
its
dinner
round
the
corpse
the
villagers
had
arranged
a
circular
fence
of
thorns
with
one
opening
across
which
they
had
stretched
a
cord
attached
at
the
other
end
to
the
trigger
of
an
old
shooting
iron
of
some
sort
charged
with
slugs
and
looking
hard
at
the
opening
the
gun
had
gone
off
during
the
night
and
the
ground
was
soaked
with
blood
a
few
yards
off
there
was
another
great
swamp
of
blood
the
beast
had
staggered
away
and
lain
down
for
a
while
faint
and
sick
then
it
had
got
up
and
crawled
home
still
dripping
with
blood
by
which
we
tracked
it
for
a
good
distance
but
the
trace
grew
gradually
fainter
and
at
last
ceased
altogether
it
has
gone
to
the
fort
said
the
men
bags
always
go
to
the
fort
i
pointed
out
that
if
it
had
meant
to
go
to
the
fort
it
would
have
gone
towards
the
fort
instead
of
in
another
direction
but
the
argument
did
not
move
them
the
fort
is
a
jungle
and
where
else
should
a
take
refuge
but
in
a
jungle
however
i
was
obstinate
and
pursued
the
original
direction
until
we
arrived
at
the
brow
of
the
hill
where
it
sloped
steeply
down
to
the
sea
the
whole
slope
for
half
a
mile
was
covered
with
a
dense
scrub
of
lantana
bushes
this
is
another
plant
introduced
in
some
century
from
south
america
and
planted
first
in
gardens
for
its
profuse
clusters
of
red
and
pink
blossoms
it
is
a
near
relation
of
the
garden
verbena
whence
it
has
spread
like
the
rabbit
in
new
zealand
and
become
a
nuisance
there
i
cried
pointing
at
the
scrub
there
without
doubt
your
wounded
is
lying
some
of
the
men
unbelieving
still
were
amusing
themselves
by
rolling
large
stones
down
the
slope
when
suddenly
there
was
a
sound
of
scrambling
and
across
an
opening
in
the
scrub
in
sight
of
us
all
a
huge
hyaena
scurried
away
on
three
legs
i
sent
a
man
for
my
rifle
which
i
had
not
brought
with
me
never
expecting
to
require
it
until
a
regular
campaign
could
be
arranged
as
soon
as
it
arrived
we
formed
in
line
and
advanced
throwing
stones
in
all
directions
make
no
offering
of
admiration
at
the
shrine
of
our
hardihood
for
we
were
in
no
peril
among
carnivorous
beasts
there
is
not
a
more
contemptible
poltroon
than
the
hyaena
even
when
wounded
a
friend
of
mine
once
tied
up
a
billy
goat
as
a
bait
for
a
panther
and
sat
up
over
it
in
a
tree
in
the
middle
of
the
night
a
hyaena
nosed
it
from
afar
and
came
sneaking
up
in
the
rear
for
hyaenas
love
the
flesh
of
goats
next
to
that
of
dogs
but
the
goat
saw
it
and
turning
about
bravely
presented
his
horned
front
this
the
hyaena
could
not
find
stomach
to
face
for
two
hours
he
manoeuvred
to
take
the
goat
in
rear
but
it
turned
as
he
circled
and
stood
up
to
him
stoutly
till
the
dawn
came
and
my
friend
cut
short
its
disreputable
career
with
a
bullet
to
return
to
my
story
we
had
not
gone
far
when
on
a
lower
level
not
many
yards
from
me
i
was
suddenly
confronted
by
that
repulsive
ghoulish
physiognomy
which
can
never
be
forgotten
when
once
seen
the
snout
broad
forehead
and
great
upstanding
ears
instantly
the
beast
wheeled
and
scrambled
over
a
bank
receiving
a
hasty
rear
shot
which
as
i
afterwards
found
left
it
but
one
limb
to
go
with
for
the
bullet
passed
clean
through
a
hindleg
and
lodged
in
a
foreleg
it
went
on
however
and
some
time
passed
before
i
descried
it
far
off
dragging
itself
painfully
across
an
open
space
a
careful
shot
finished
it
and
it
died
under
a
thick
bush
where
we
found
it
and
dragged
it
out
it
proved
to
be
a
large
male
measuring
feet
inches
from
which
something
over
a
foot
must
be
deducted
for
its
shabby
tail
the
natives
all
maintained
still
that
their
cow
had
been
killed
by
a
panther
saying
that
the
hyaena
had
come
on
the
second
night
after
their
manner
to
fill
its
base
belly
with
the
leavings
and
there
was
some
circumstantial
evidence
in
favour
of
this
view
in
the
first
place
i
never
heard
of
a
hyaena
having
the
audacity
to
attack
a
cow
in
the
second
the
on
the
cow
showed
that
it
had
been
executed
according
to
the
tradition
of
all
the
great
cats
by
seizing
its
throat
and
breaking
its
neck
and
in
the
third
a
hyaena
sitting
down
to
such
a
meal
would
certainly
have
begun
with
calf
head
and
crunched
up
every
bone
of
the
skull
before
thinking
of
sirloin
or
rumpsteak
but
the
absurdity
of
a
panther
being
found
in
such
a
region
outweighed
all
this
and
i
scoffed
i
was
yet
to
learn
a
lesson
in
humility
out
of
this
adventure
two
years
later
i
sailed
over
the
bar
and
dropped
anchor
at
the
same
spot
i
was
met
with
the
intelligence
that
on
the
previous
evening
two
panthers
had
been
seen
sitting
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
gazing
at
the
beauties
of
the
fading
sunset
as
wild
beasts
are
so
fond
of
doing
a
night
or
two
later
a
cow
was
attacked
in
a
neighbouring
field
and
staggering
into
the
village
fell
down
and
died
in
a
narrow
alley
between
two
houses
the
panther
followed
and
prowled
about
all
night
but
the
villagers
hammering
at
their
doors
with
sticks
scared
it
from
its
meal
i
at
once
had
a
nest
put
up
in
a
small
tree
and
took
my
position
in
it
at
sunset
the
common
people
in
india
do
not
waste
much
money
on
lamp
oil
preferring
to
sleep
during
the
hours
appointed
by
nature
for
the
purpose
so
it
was
not
long
before
all
doors
were
securely
barred
and
quietness
reigned
then
the
mosquitoes
awoke
and
came
to
inquire
for
me
the
little
bats
how
i
blessed
them
wheeled
about
my
head
the
called
to
his
fellow
and
the
little
owls
sat
on
a
branch
together
and
talked
to
each
other
about
me
hour
after
hour
passed
and
it
became
too
dark
in
that
narrow
alley
to
see
a
panther
if
it
had
come
so
i
came
down
and
got
to
my
boat
the
panther
was
engaged
a
mile
away
dining
on
another
cow
on
further
inquiry
i
learned
that
there
was
some
good
forest
a
day
journey
distant
and
it
was
quite
the
fashion
among
the
panthers
of
that
place
to
spend
a
weekend
occasionally
at
a
spot
so
full
of
all
delights
as
this
dark
fort
xiv
the
purbhoo
i
do
not
believe
that
the
member
of
parliament
who
moved
the
adjournment
of
the
house
to
consider
the
culpable
carelessness
of
the
government
of
india
in
allowing
the
rajah
of
muttighur
to
fall
into
the
moat
of
his
own
castle
when
he
was
drunk
could
have
told
you
what
a
purbhoo
is
not
though
you
had
spelled
it
prabhu
so
that
he
could
find
it
in
his
of
course
he
saw
hundreds
of
them
during
that
christmas
which
he
spent
in
the
east
before
he
wrote
his
book
but
then
he
took
them
all
for
brahmins
he
never
noticed
that
the
curve
of
their
turbans
was
not
the
same
and
the
idol
mark
on
their
foreheads
was
quite
different
nor
even
that
their
shoes
were
not
forked
at
the
toes
but
ended
in
a
sharp
point
curled
upwards
and
if
he
did
not
see
these
things
which
were
on
the
surface
what
could
he
know
of
matters
that
lie
deeper
now
the
first
and
most
important
thing
to
be
known
respecting
the
purbhoo
the
fundamental
fact
of
him
is
that
he
is
not
a
brahmin
if
he
were
a
brahmin
one
essential
piece
of
our
administrative
apparatus
in
india
would
be
wanting
and
without
it
the
whole
machinery
would
assuredly
go
out
of
order
nor
is
it
easy
to
see
how
we
could
replace
him
not
one
of
the
other
castes
would
serve
even
as
a
makeshift
they
are
all
too
far
removed
from
the
brahmin
but
the
purbhoo
is
near
him
irritatingly
near
him
and
he
has
proved
in
practice
to
be
just
the
sort
of
homoeopathic
remedy
we
require
the
the
outward
blister
by
wise
application
of
which
we
can
keep
down
the
internal
inflammation
in
speaking
of
the
brahmin
as
an
inflammation
in
the
body
politic
i
disown
all
offensive
and
invidious
implications
i
am
only
using
a
convenient
simile
you
may
reverse
it
if
you
like
and
make
the
disease
stand
for
the
purbhoo
in
which
case
the
brahmin
will
be
the
blister
which
way
fits
the
facts
best
will
depend
upon
which
caste
chances
at
the
time
to
be
nearest
to
the
vitals
of
government
the
case
stands
thus
before
the
days
of
british
rule
the
brahmin
was
the
priest
and
man
of
letters
the
clerke
in
short
the
rajahs
and
chiefs
were
much
of
the
same
mind
as
old
douglas
thanks
to
saint
bothan
son
of
mine
save
gawain
could
pen
a
line
gawain
being
a
bishop
as
a
mohammedan
gentleman
related
to
one
of
the
ruling
indian
princes
put
the
matter
when
speaking
to
me
a
few
years
ago
in
those
days
none
of
us
could
write
our
pen
was
the
sword
if
any
writing
had
to
be
done
the
brahmin
was
called
in
and
no
doubt
he
did
excellent
service
being
diligent
astute
and
withal
pliant
and
diplomatic
if
to
these
qualities
he
added
ambition
he
might
and
often
did
become
a
cardinal
wolsey
in
the
state
in
poona
for
example
the
brahmin
prime
minister
gradually
overshadowed
the
mahratta
king
and
the
descendant
of
shivajee
was
put
on
a
back
shelf
as
rajah
of
sattara
while
the
peishwa
ruled
at
the
capital
of
course
this
carnal
advancement
was
not
gained
without
some
sacrifice
of
his
spiritual
character
and
the
secular
brahmin
had
to
bow
to
the
penniless
bhut
or
regular
brahmin
who
refusing
to
contaminate
his
sanctity
by
doing
any
kind
of
work
ate
of
the
temple
or
lived
by
royal
bounty
or
private
charity
and
by
the
free
breakfasts
without
which
a
marriage
thread
ceremony
or
funeral
in
a
house
could
not
be
respectably
celebrated
idleness
and
sanctity
are
a
powerful
combination
and
it
is
written
in
the
that
every
day
in
which
a
holy
man
does
no
work
for
his
bread
but
lives
by
begging
is
equal
in
the
eyes
of
the
gods
to
a
day
spent
in
fasting
so
though
the
prospect
of
power
and
wealth
might
tempt
a
few
restless
and
wayward
spirits
the
great
mass
of
the
brahmin
caste
clung
to
the
sacred
calling
all
this
time
the
purbhoo
was
in
the
land
but
insignificant
he
had
no
sacred
calling
tradition
assigned
him
a
hybrid
origin
he
could
not
presume
to
be
a
warrior
because
his
mother
was
a
nor
could
he
condescend
to
be
a
farmer
for
his
father
was
a
so
the
gods
had
given
him
the
pen
and
he
was
a
writer
not
a
secretary
but
a
humble
but
when
the
portuguese
and
then
the
british
came
upon
the
scene
not
ruling
by
word
of
mouth
like
the
native
rajahs
but
inditing
their
orders
and
keeping
records
the
purbhoo
saw
an
open
door
and
went
in
then
the
brahmin
woke
up
for
he
saw
that
he
was
in
evil
case
the
spirit
of
the
british
was
falling
like
a
blight
and
a
pestilence
upon
the
means
by
which
he
had
lived
drying
up
the
fountains
of
religious
revenue
and
slowly
but
surely
blighting
the
luxuriance
of
that
pious
liberality
which
always
took
the
form
of
feeding
holy
men
he
found
that
he
must
work
for
his
bread
whether
he
liked
it
or
not
and
the
only
implement
of
secular
work
that
would
not
soil
his
priestly
hand
was
the
pen
and
this
was
already
taken
up
by
the
purbhoo
who
carried
himself
haughtily
under
the
new
and
showed
no
mind
to
make
way
for
the
holier
man
hence
sprang
those
bitter
enmities
and
jealousies
which
have
done
so
much
to
lighten
the
difficulties
of
our
position
the
british
government
has
often
been
accused
of
acting
on
the
maxim
et
it
is
a
libel
we
do
not
divide
for
there
is
no
need
division
is
already
there
we
have
only
to
rejoice
and
rule
how
well
and
justly
we
rule
all
the
world
knows
but
only
the
initiated
know
how
much
we
owe
to
the
fact
that
the
talents
and
energies
which
would
otherwise
be
employed
in
thwarting
our
just
intentions
and
phlebotomising
the
ryot
are
largely
preoccupied
with
the
more
useful
work
of
thwarting
and
undermining
each
other
what
could
a
collector
do
against
a
host
of
clerks
and
subordinate
magistrates
and
petty
officials
of
every
grade
all
armed
with
the
awfulness
of
a
sanctity
all
hedged
round
with
the
prestige
of
an
ancient
supremacy
endowed
with
a
genius
for
underground
work
which
the
englishman
never
fathoms
and
all
leagued
together
to
suck
to
the
uttermost
the
life
blood
of
those
inferior
castes
which
were
created
expressly
for
their
advantage
is
working
in
a
foreign
language
among
customs
and
ways
of
thought
which
it
takes
a
lifetime
to
understand
are
using
their
mother
tongue
and
handling
matters
that
they
have
known
from
childhood
can
not
tell
a
lie
and
is
ashamed
to
deceive
are
trained
in
a
thrifty
policy
which
saves
the
truth
for
a
last
resort
in
case
everything
else
should
fail
he
would
be
helpless
in
their
hands
as
a
sucking
child
but
he
knows
they
will
do
for
him
what
he
can
not
do
for
himself
the
purbhoo
will
lie
in
wait
for
the
brahmin
and
the
brahmin
will
keep
his
lynx
eye
on
the
purbhoo
and
woe
to
the
one
who
trips
first
so
the
collector
arranges
his
men
with
judicious
skill
to
the
fostering
of
each
other
virtue
and
the
result
is
most
gratifying
the
country
blesses
his
administration
and
his
subordinates
are
equally
surprised
and
delighted
at
their
own
integrity
i
speak
of
a
wise
and
able
administrator
there
are
men
in
the
indian
civil
service
who
are
neither
wise
nor
able
and
some
who
are
not
administrators
at
all
having
most
unhappily
mistaken
their
vocation
when
such
a
one
becomes
collector
of
a
district
his
or
chief
secretary
sees
that
that
tide
in
the
affairs
of
men
has
come
which
taken
at
the
flood
leads
on
to
fortune
and
his
all
through
the
service
are
filled
with
unholy
joy
but
he
does
nothing
rash
or
hasty
wilily
and
patiently
he
goes
to
work
to
make
his
own
foundation
sure
first
of
all
he
studies
his
chief
under
all
conditions
discovers
his
little
foibles
and
vanities
and
feeds
them
sedulously
he
masters
codes
rules
and
regulations
standing
orders
precedents
and
past
correspondence
till
it
is
dangerous
to
contradict
him
and
always
safe
to
trust
him
in
every
difficulty
he
is
at
hand
clearing
away
perplexity
and
refreshing
the
swithering
mind
with
his
precision
and
assurance
he
becomes
indispensable
the
collector
reposes
absolute
confidence
in
him
and
is
proud
to
say
so
in
his
reports
then
the
if
he
is
a
brahmin
addresses
himself
to
the
task
of
eliminating
the
purbhoo
from
the
service
or
at
least
depriving
him
of
place
and
power
it
is
a
delicate
task
but
the
brahmin
touch
is
light
he
never
disparages
a
purbhoo
from
that
day
damning
with
faint
praise
is
safer
and
as
effectual
he
practises
the
charity
which
covereth
a
multitude
of
faults
but
he
leaves
a
tag
end
of
one
peeping
out
to
attract
curiosity
and
if
the
collector
asks
questions
he
is
candid
and
tells
the
truth
though
with
manifest
reluctance
then
he
grapples
with
the
gradation
lists
which
have
fallen
into
confusion
and
puts
them
into
such
excellent
order
that
the
collector
can
see
at
a
glance
every
man
past
services
and
present
claims
to
promotion
and
from
these
lists
it
appears
that
clearly
whenever
any
vacancy
has
to
be
filled
a
brahmin
has
the
first
claim
and
so
as
the
shades
of
night
yield
to
the
dawn
of
day
the
purbhoo
by
degrees
fades
away
and
disappears
and
the
star
of
the
brahmin
rises
and
shines
everywhere
with
still
increasing
splendour
but
the
purbhoo
possesses
his
soul
in
patience
and
keeps
a
note
of
every
slip
that
the
brahmin
makes
for
the
next
may
be
a
purbhoo
and
then
the
day
of
reckoning
will
come
and
old
scores
will
be
paid
off
the
brahmin
knows
that
too
and
the
thought
of
it
makes
him
walk
warily
even
in
the
day
of
his
prosperity
thus
our
administration
is
saved
from
utter
corruption
xv
the
coconut
tree
among
the
classic
which
passed
like
shooting
stars
across
those
dark
hours
of
our
boyhood
in
which
we
wrestled
with
the
grim
rudiments
of
latin
and
greek
and
which
abide
in
the
memory
after
nearly
all
that
they
helped
to
brighten
has
passed
away
there
was
one
which
related
to
a
contest
between
neptune
and
minerva
as
to
which
should
confer
the
greatest
benefit
on
the
human
race
neptune
first
struck
his
trident
on
the
ground
or
was
it
on
the
waves
eheu
fugaces
no
that
also
is
gone
and
there
sprang
forth
a
noble
steed
pawing
the
ground
terrible
in
war
and
no
less
useful
in
peace
then
the
watery
god
leaned
back
and
smiled
as
if
he
would
say
now
beat
that
but
the
goddess
of
wisdom
brought
out
of
the
earth
a
modest
dark
tree
bearing
olives
and
in
classic
phrase
took
the
cake
oriental
mythology
is
more
luxuriant
and
fantastic
than
that
of
the
west
but
i
do
not
know
if
it
has
any
legend
parallel
to
this
if
it
has
then
i
am
sure
the
palm
is
awarded
to
the
deity
who
gave
to
the
human
race
the
tree
that
bears
the
coconut
passing
a
confectioner
shop
i
saw
a
tempting
packet
labelled
cokernut
toffee
i
bought
a
pennyworth
and
gave
it
to
my
little
girl
and
i
laye
how
many
boys
and
girls
are
there
in
this
kingdom
to
whom
the
word
coconut
connotes
an
ingredient
which
goes
to
the
making
of
a
very
toothsome
sweetie
and
how
many
confectioners
and
shop
girls
are
there
whose
idea
is
no
broader
again
i
laye
and
merrie
sang
the
birde
as
she
sat
upon
the
spraye
and
i
said
little
bird
what
do
you
know
of
the
coconut
and
it
made
answer
it
is
a
cup
full
of
food
rich
and
sweet
which
kind
hands
hang
out
for
me
in
winter
how
narrow
may
be
the
through
which
we
take
our
outlook
on
things
human
and
divine
never
doubting
that
we
see
the
whole
in
our
own
british
empire
only
a
few
thousand
miles
away
sits
a
mild
hindu
almost
unclad
and
wholly
unlettered
to
whom
the
tree
that
bore
the
fruit
that
flavoured
the
toffee
that
my
little
girl
is
enjoying
seems
to
be
one
of
the
predominating
tints
of
the
whole
landscape
of
life
it
puts
a
roof
over
his
head
it
lightens
his
darkness
it
helps
to
feed
his
body
it
furnishes
the
wine
that
maketh
glad
his
heart
and
the
oil
that
causeth
his
face
to
shine
and
time
would
fail
me
to
tell
of
all
the
other
things
that
it
does
for
him
as
a
type
and
symbol
it
is
always
about
him
spanning
the
sunshine
and
shower
of
life
with
bows
of
hope
the
coconut
tree
is
a
palm
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
cocoa
of
the
breakfast
table
that
word
is
a
perversion
of
cacao
and
came
to
us
from
mexico
the
other
is
the
portuguese
word
coco
which
means
a
nut
it
is
what
vasco
da
gama
called
the
thing
when
he
first
saw
it
and
the
word
with
our
english
translation
added
has
stuck
to
it
the
tree
is
i
need
scarcely
say
a
palm
one
of
many
kinds
that
flourish
in
india
but
none
of
them
can
be
ranked
with
it
the
rough
date
palm
makes
dense
groves
on
sandy
plains
but
brings
no
fruit
to
perfection
pining
for
something
which
only
arabia
can
supply
the
strong
but
unprofitable
brab
or
fan
palm
rises
on
rocky
hills
the
beautiful
palm
in
forests
solitarily
while
the
areca
rears
its
tall
smooth
stem
and
delicate
head
in
gardens
and
supplies
millions
with
a
solace
more
indispensable
than
tobacco
or
tea
but
the
coconut
loves
a
sandy
soil
and
the
salt
breath
of
the
sea
and
the
company
of
its
own
kind
the
others
grow
erect
as
a
mast
but
the
gentle
coconuts
lean
on
the
wind
and
mingle
the
waving
of
their
sisterly
arms
casting
a
grateful
shade
on
the
humble
folk
who
live
under
their
blessing
to
the
mariner
sailing
by
india
coral
strand
that
country
presents
the
aspect
of
an
endless
beach
of
shell

quite
innocent
of
coral
on
which
the
surf
breaks
continually
into
dazzling
white
foam
against
a
dark
background
of
pensive
palms
he
might
naturally
suppose
that
they
had
grown
up
of
themselves
like
the
and
aloes
which
sometimes
share
the
beach
with
them
but
that
would
be
a
great
mistake
everyone
of
them
has
been
planted
and
carefully
watered
for
years
and
manured
annually
with
fresh
foliage
of
forest
trees
buried
in
a
moat
round
the
root
and
so
it
grew
in
stature
but
not
in
girth
until
its
head
was
sixty
seventy
or
even
eighty
feet
above
the
ground
and
a
hundred
nuts
of
various
sizes
hung
in
bunches
from
long
shiny
green
arms
each
as
thick
as

there
is
no
production
of

that
i

than
a
coconut

the

presents
it
the

in

there
is

enjoying
the
scientific

of

it
seems
to
be
a
special
invention
as
big
as
a

and
armed
with
two
fearful
pairs
of
pincers
in

for
rending
the

a

with

slashed
off
the
tough
outer

the

agglutinated

he
has
only
to
crack
the
hard

how
little
we

conceive
the

in

a

his

always
knew
it
when
the

has
been
turned
to
account
the
utilities
of

the
shell
neatly
bisected
makes

shell
it

it
must
first
be
soaked
for
some
months
in

pit
on

slimy
bank

all
the
stuff
that
holds
it
together
in
a
stiff
and
obdurate
mass
has
rotted
away

set
free
those
hard
and
smooth
fibres
which
nothing

rot
these
when
thoroughly
purged
of
the
foul
black
pollution
in
which
they
have
sweltered

go
out
to
all
quarters
of
the

make
indestructible
door
mats

other
indispensable
things
it

penetrate

a

lives
to
mat
his
verandahs
and
stuff
his

and
who
shall
recount
a
tithe
of
its
other
uses
of
course
the
nude
man
under
the
coconut
tree
knows
nothing
of
all
this
he
does
without
a
mattress
and
has
no
use
for
a
door
mat
but
he
can
not
do
without
cordage
and
if
you
took
from
him
his
coconut
fibre
life
would
almost
stop
wherewith
would
he
bind
the
rafters
of
his
hut
to
the
beams
or
tether
the
cow
or
let
down
the
bucket
into
the
well
what
would
all
the
boats
do
that
traverse
the
backwater
or
lie
at
anchor
in

or
line

coconut
tree
a
beam
will
fall
to
the
earth
sixty
feet
in
length
hard
as
teak
and
already
rounded
and
smoothed
true
you
can
not
saw
it
into
planks
but
no
one
will
complain
of
that
in
a
village
which
does
not
own
a
saw
it
cleaves
readily
enough
and
straightly
forming
long
troughs
most
useful
for
leading
water
from
the
well
to
the
plantation
and
for
many
other
purposes
it
can
also
be
chopped
into
lengths
suitable
for
the
ridge
poles
of
the
hut
or
for
bridges
to
span
the
deep
ditches
which
drain
the
rice
fields
or
feed
the
salt
pans
when
out
in
quest
of
snipe
i
have
sometimes
had
to
choose
between
crossing
by
one
of
those
bridges
innocent
of
even
a
handrail
and
wading
through
the
black
slough
of
despond
which
it
spanned
choosing
neither
i
went
home
but
the
kolee
and
the
agree
trip
over
them
like
birds
balancing
household
chattels
on
their
steady
heads
we
must
not
think
however
of
the
trunk
as
at
the
best
anything
more
than
a
of
the
coconut
tree
whose
head
is
more
than
its
body
even
while
it
lives
its
head
is
shorn
once
a
year
for
as
fresh
fronds
push
out
and
upward
from
the
centre
those
of
the
outer
circle
get
old
and
must
be
cut
away
and
when
one
of
those
feathery
fronds
toying
with
the
breeze
comes
crashing
to
the
ground
it
is
ten
or
twelve
feet
long
and
consists
of
a
great
backbone
as
thick
at
the
base
as
a
man
leg
with
a
row
of
swords
on
either
side
about
a
yard
in
length
they
are
hard
and
tough
but
supple
yet
and
of
a
shiny
green
colour
but
they
will
turn
to
brown
as
they
wither
now
observe
that
this
gigantic
leaf
like
everything
else
about
the
coconut
tree
is
almost
a
article
demanding
no
machinery
to
turn
it
to
account
except
the
koita
which
hangs
ever
ready
from
the
nude
man
girdle
with
it
he
will
cleave
the
backbone
lengthwise
and
then
taking
each
half
separately
he
will
simply
twist
backwards
every
second
sword
and
plait
them
all
into
a
mat
two
feet
wide
eight
or
ten
feet
long
and
firmly
bounded
and
held
together
on
one
side
by
the
unbreakable
backbone
this
is
a
jaolee
lighter
than
slates
or
tiles
and
more
handy
than
any
form
of
thatch
you
have
just
to
arrange
your
jaolees
neatly
on
your
bamboo
frame
each
overlapping
the
one
below
it
then
tie
them
securely
in
their
places
with
coir
rope
and
your
roof
is
made
for
a
year
there
is
yet
another
benevolence
of
the
coconut
tree
which
i
have
left
to
the
last
and
the
simple
folk
of
whom
i
am
trying
to
write
with
fellow
feeling
would
certainly
have
named
it
first
i
ought
to
refer
to
it
as
a
curse
they
without
qualm
or
question
call
it
a
blessing
let
me
try
to
describe
it
dispassionately
if
you
wander
in
any
palm
grove
in
western
india
looking
upward
it
will
soon
strike
you
that
a
large
number
of
the
trees
do
not
seem
to
bear
coconuts
at
all
but
black
earthen
pots
if
your
visit
should
chance
to
be
made
early
in
the
morning
or
late
in
the
afternoon
the
mystery
will
soon
be
revealed
you
will
see
a
dusky
sinewy
figure
not
of
a
monkey
but
of
a
man
ascending
and
descending
those
trees
with
marvellous
celerity
and
ease
grasping
the
trunks
with
his
hands
and
fitting
his
naked
feet
into
slight
notches
cut
in
them
the
distance
between
the
notches
is
so
great
that
his
knee
goes
up
to
his
chin
at
each
step
but
he
is
as
supple
as
he
is
sinewy
and
feels
no
inconvenience
for
he
is
a
bhundaree
or
and
his
forefathers
have
been
bhundarees
since
the
time
i
suppose
when
manu
made
his
immortal
laws
his
waistcloth
is
tightly
girded
about
him
in
his
hand
he
carries
a
broad
billhook
as
bright
and
keen
as
a
razor
and
from
his
caudal
region
depends
a
tail
more
strange
than
any
borne
by
beast
or
reptile
it
looks
like
a
large
brown
pot
constructed
in
the
middle
it
is
in
fact
a
large
gourd
or
calabash
hanging
by
a
hook
from
the
waistband
when
he
has
reached
the
top
of
a
tree
he
gets
among
the
branches
and
sitting
astride
of
one
of
them
proceeds
to
detach
one
of
the
black
pots
from
the
stout
fruit
stem
on
which
it
is
fastened
and
empty
its
contents
into
his
tail
then
taking
his
billhook
he
carefully
pares
the
raw
end
of
the
stem
refastens
the
black
pot
in
its
place
and
hurries
down
to
make
the
ascent
of
another
tree
and
so
on
until
his
tail
is
full
of
a
foaming
white
liquor
spotted
with
drowned
honey
bees
and
filling
the
surrounding
air
with
a
rank
odour
of
fermentation
this
liquor
is
toddy
if
i
were
a
darwin
i
would
not
leave
that
word
until
i
had
traced
the
agencies
which
wafted
it
over
sea
and
land
from
the
shores
of
hindustan
to
the
scottish
coast
where
it
first
took
root
and
quickly
adapting
itself
to
a
strange
environment
developed
into
a
new
and
vigorous
species
spread
like
the
thistle
and
became
a
national
institution
at
first
it
was
only
the
briton
way
of
mouthing
a
common
native
word
tadi
pronounced
which
meant
palm
juice
but
it
became
current
in
its
present
shape
as
early
as
when
the
traveller
fryer
wrote
of
the
natives
singing
and
roaring
all
night
long
being
drunk
with
toddy
the
wine
of
the
cocoe
about
a
century
later
burns
sang
the
lads
and
lasses
blythely
bent
to
mind
baith
saul
and
body
sit
round
the
table
weel
content
and
steer
about
the
toddy
between
these
i
can
find
no
vestigia
but
imagination
easily
fills
the
gap
i
see
a
company
of
jovial
scots
met
in
calcutta
or
surat
on
andrew
day
european
wines
and
beer
are
expensive
whisky
not
obtainable
at
all
but
the
skilful
khansamah
makes
up
a
punch
with
toddy
spirit
hot
water
sugar
and
limes
and
they
are
well
content
after
many
years
i
see
the
few
of
them
who
still
survive
foregathered
again
in
the
old
country
and
one
proposes
to
have
a
good
brew
of
toddy
for
auld
lang
syne
if
real
toddy
spirit
can
not
be
had
what
of
that
whisky
is
found
to
take
very
kindly
to
hot
water
and
sugar
and
limes
and
the
old
folks
at
home
and
the
neighbours
and
the
minister
himself
pronounce
a
most
favourable
verdict
on
toddy
in
short
it
has
come
to
stay
but
we
must
return
to
the
liquor
in
the
bhundaree
gourd
it
is
the
rich
sap
which
should
have
gone
to
the
forming
of
coconuts
which
is
intercepted
by
cutting
off
the
point
of
the
fruit
stalk
and
tying
on
an
earthen
pot
if
the
pot
is
clean
the
juice
when
it
is
taken
down
in
the
morning
not
fermented
yet
but
just
beginning
to
sparkle
with
minute
bubbles
not
too
sweet
and
not
so
oily
as
the
milk
of
the
coconut
is
nectar
to
a
hot
and
thirsty
soul
no
summer
drink
have
i
drunk
so
innocently
restorative
after
a
hot
and
toilsome
march
on
a
broiling
may
morning
but
the
bhundaree
will
not
squander
it
so
he
takes
care
not
to
clean
his
pots
and
when
he
takes
them
down
in
the
morning
the
liquor
is
already
foaming
like
london
stout
not
that
he
means
to
drink
it
himself
for
you
must
know
that
by
the
rules
of
his
caste
he
is
a
total
abstainer
being
a
bhundaree
whose
function
is
to
draw
toddy
not
to
drink
it
this
is
one
of
those
profound
institutes
by
which
the
wisdom
of
the
ancients
fenced
the
whole
social
system
of
this
strange
land
but
while
the
bhundaree
must
refuse
all
intoxicating
drinks
himself
it
is
his
duty
to
exercise
a
large
tolerance
towards
those
who
are
not
so
hindered
he
is
in
fact
a
partner
in
the
business
of
babajee
licensed
vendor
of
fresh
toddy
towards
whose
spacious
shop
thatched
with
jaolees
he
now
carries
his
gourds
there
the
contents
will
stand
in
dirty
vessels
and
a
warm
place
maturing
their
exhilarating
qualities
until
the
evening
when
the
tam
o
shanters
and
souter
johnnies
of
the
village
begin
to
assemble
and
squat
in
a
ring
in
the
open
space
in
front
they
may
be
kolees
or
fishermen
and
agrees
who
make
salt
and
aboriginal
katkurrees
from
the
jungle
with
their
bows
and
arrows
most
bibulous
of
all
but
among
them
all
there
will
be
no
bhundaree
babajee
sits
apart
presiding
and
serving
beside
a
dirty
table
on
which
are
many
bottles
and
dirty
tumblers
of
patterns
which
were
on
our
tables
thirty
years
ago
the
assembly
begins
solemnly
discussing
social
problems
and
bartering
village
gossip
for
the
hindu
is
by
nature
staid
after
a
while
at
the
second
bottle
perhaps
cheerfulness
will
supervene
then
mirth
and
garrulity
ending
as
the
night
closes
round
with
wordy
contention
and
a
general
brawl
but
nothing
serious
will
happen
for
toddy
though
decidedly
heady
is
at
the
worst
a
thin
potation
a
strong
and
very
pure
spirit
is
distilled
from
it
which
has
its
devotees
but
the
rustic
as
a
rule
prefers
quantity
to
quality
we
are
often
told
that
the
british
government
taught
the
people
of
india
to
drink
but
the
scene
that
i
have
tried
to
describe
is
indigenous
conviviality
much
older
than
any
european
connection
with
the
country
is
it
any
wonder
that
the
coconut
has
become
an
emblem
of
fertility
and
prosperity
and
all
good
luck
when
a
new
house
is
building
you
will
see
a
high
pole
over
the
doorway
bearing
coconuts
at
the
top
with
an
umbrella
spread
over
them
do
not
ask
the
owner
the
meaning
of
the
sign
for
he
does
not
know
he
does
not
think
about
such
matters
but
he
feels
about
them
and
he
knows
that
that
is
the
right
thing
to
do
besides
he
might
ask
you
why
you
nail
a
horseshoe
over
your
door
the
difference
between
us
and
him
is
that
we
do
such
things
in
jest
no
longer
believing
in
them
they
are
the
husks
of
a
dead
faith
with
us
but
the
hindu
faith
is
very
living
still
so
when
he
breaks
a
coconut
at
the
launching
of
a
pattimar
he
is
a
gainer
in
hope
if
nothing
else
while
we
squander
our
champagne
and
gain
nothing
that
nut
follows
him
even
to
the
grave
or
burning
ground
with
mystic
significances
which
i
can
not
explain
i
have
been
told
that
when
a
very
holy
man
dies
who
always
clothed
himself
in
ashes
and
never
profaned
his
hands
with
work
his
disciples
sometimes
break
a
coconut
over
his
head
if
the
spirit
can
escape
from
the
body
through
the
sutures
of
the
skull
instead
of
by
any
of
the
other
orifices
it
is
believed
to
find
a
more
direct
route
to
heaven
so
the
purpose
of
this
ceremony
may
be
to
facilitate
its
exit
that
way
in
that
case
the
breaking
of
the
nut
is
perhaps
only
an
accident
due
to
its
not
being
so
hard
as
the
holy
man
skull
xvi
the
betel
nut
one
half
the
world
does
not
know
how
the
other
half
lives
noticing
a
pot
of
areca
nut
toothpaste
on
a
chemist
counter
i
asked
him
what
the
peculiar
properties
of
the
areca
nut
were
in
short
what
was
it
good
for
he
replied
that
it
was
an
astringent
and
acted
beneficially
on
the
gums
but
he
had
never
heard
that
it
was
used
for
any
other
purpose
than
the
manufacture
of
an
elegant
dentifrice
i
felt
inclined
to
question
him
about
the
camel
in
order
to
see
whether
he
would
tell
me
that
it
was
a
tropical
animal
chiefly
noted
for
the
fine
quality
of
its
hair
from
which
artist
brushes
were
made
here
was
a
man
whose
special
business
it
is
to
know
the
properties
and
uses
of
all
drugs
and
their
action
on
the
human
system
and
he
had
not
the
faintest
notion
that
there
are
nearly
millions
of
his
majesty
subjects
and
many
millions
more
beyond
his
empire
who
could
scarcely
think
of
life
as
a
thing
to
be
desired
if
they
were
obliged
to
go
through
it
without
the
areca
nut
for
the
areca
nut
is
the
betel
nut
in
the
canarese
language
and
the
kindred
dialects
of
malabar
it
is
called
by
a
name
which
is
rendered
as
or
in
scientific
books
but
would
stand
more
chance
of
being
correctly
pronounced
by
the
average
englishman
if
it
were
spelled
the
coast
districts
of
canara
and
malabar
being
famed
for
their
betel
nuts
the
trade
name
of
the
article
was
taken
from
the
languages
current
there
and
was
tortured
by
the
portuguese
into
over
the
greater
part
of
india
the
natives
use
the
hindustanee
name
but
by
englishmen
it
is
best
known
as
the
betel
nut
because
it
is
always
found
in
company
with
the
betel
leaf
with
which
however
it
has
no
more
connection
than
strawberries
have
with
cream
the
one
is
the
leaf
of
a
kind
of
pepper
vine
and
the
other
is
the
seed
or
nut
of
a
palm
but
nature
and
man
have
combined
to
marry
them
to
one
another
and
it
is
difficult
to
think
of
them
separately
in
life
the
betel
vine
climbs
up
the
stem
of
the
areca
palm
and
in
death
the
areca
nut
is
rolled
in
a
shroud
of
the
betel
leaf
and
the
two
are
munched
together
other
things
are
often
added
to
the
morsel
such
as
a
clove
a
cardamom
or
a
pinch
of
tobacco
and
a
small
quantity
of
fresh
lime
is
indispensable
what
is
the
precise
nature
of
the
consolation
derived
from
the
chewing
of
this
mixture
it
is
not
easy
to
say
outwardly
it
produces
effects
which
are
visible
enough
to
wit
a
most
copious
flow
of
saliva
which
is
dyed
deep
red
by
the
juice
of
the
nut
so
that
a
betel
nut
chewer
seems
to
go
about
spitting
blood
all
the
day
as
every
hindu
is
a
betel
nut
chewer
those
superficial
miles
of
country
which
make
up
our
indian
empire
must
be
bespattered
to
a
degree
which
it
dizzies
the
mind
to
contemplate
this
is
one
of
the
difficulties
of
indian
administration
in
large
towns
and
centres
of
business
it
is
found
necessary
to
fortify
the
public
buildings
in
various
ways
the
custom
house
in
bombay
has
the
wall
painted
with
dark
red
ochre
to
a
height
of
three
or
four
feet
from
the
ground
but
these
are
the
outward
results
what
is
the
inwardness
of
the
thing
in
a
word
why
do
the
people
chew
betel
nut
surely
not
that
they
may
spit
on
our
public
buildings
that
is
a
chance
result
not
sought
for
and
not
shunned
there
is
of
course
some
deeper
reason
early
travellers
in
india
were
much
exercised
about
this
and
used
to
question
the
people
from
whom
they
got
some
curious
explanations
one
reports
they
say
they
do
it
to
comfort
the
heart
nor
could
live
without
it
another
says
it
bites
in
the
mouth
accords
rheume
cooles
the
head
strengthens
the
teeth
and
is
all
their
phisicke
a
latin
writer
gets
quite
eloquent
ea
by
that
chewing
he
says
mire
recreantur
et
ad
labores
tolerandos
et
ad
languores
discutiendos
but
the
remarkable
thing
is
that
the
betel
nut
has
these
effects
only
on
the
hindu
constitution
to
a
european
the
strong
astringent
taste
and
penetrating
odour
of
the
betel
nut
are
alike
insufferable
and
there
is
no
instance
on
record
as
far
as
i
know
of
an
englishman
becoming
a
betel
nut
chewer
but
wherever
hindu
blood
circulates
not
in
india
only
but
all
through
the
islands
of
the
malay
archipelago
as
far
as
the
philippines
the
betel
nut
is
an
indispensable
ingredient
of
any
life
that
is
worth
living
mohammedanism
forbids
spirits
and
brahminism
condemns
all
things
that
intoxicate
or
stupefy
but
the
betel
nut
is
like
the
cup
that
cheers
yet
not
inebriates
no
religion
speaks
disrespectfully
of
it
it
flourishes
blessed
by
all
and
takes
its
place
among
the
institutions
of
civilisation
indeed
it
is
the
chief
cement
of
social
intercourse
in
a
country
where
all
ordinary
conviviality
between
man
and
man
is
almost
strangled
by
the
quarantine
enforced
against
ceremonial
defilement
friend
offers
friend
the
betel
nut
box
just
as
scotsmen
offered
the
in
the
hearty
old
days
that
are
passing
away
and
all
visits
of
ceremony
durbars
receptions
and
public
functions
of
the
like
kind
are
brought
to
an
august
close
by
the
distribution
of
to
go
through
this
rite
without
visible
repugnance
is
part
of
the
training
of
our
young
civil
servants
when
the
interview
or
ceremony
has
lasted
as
long
as
it
was
intended
to
last
there
enter
with
due
pomp
bearers
of
garlands
woven
of
jasmine
and
marigold
and
in
form
like
the
muffs
and
boas
that
ladies
wear
in
winter
these
are
put
upon
the
necks
and
wrists
of
the
guests
in
order
of
rank
silver
vases
and
sprinklers
follow
containing
and
attar
of
roses
you
may
ward
off
the
former
from
your
person
by
offering
your
handkerchief
for
it
and
you
may
present
the
back
of
your
hand
for
the
latter
of
which
one
drop
will
be
applied
to
your
skin
with
a
tiny
silver
or
golden
spoon
finally
when
everybody
is
reeking
with
incongruous
odours
and
trying
not
to
be
sick
a
silver
tray
appears
with
the
daintiest
little
packets
of
each
pinned
with
a
clove
and
every
guest
is
expected
to
transfer
one
to
his
mouth
for
they
have
been
prepared
by
a
brahmin
and
can
not
hurt
the
most
delicate
caste
to
an
englishman
however
it
is
now
generally
conceded
to
compromise
by
keeping
the
morsel
in
his
hand
as
if
waiting
an
opportunity
to
enjoy
it
more
at
his
leisure
when
you
get
home
your
servant
craves
it
of
you
and
contrasts
real
with
the
stuff
which
the
poor
man
gets
in
the
bazaar
the
chewing
of
betel
nut
requires
more
apparatus
and
makes
greater
demands
on
a
man
time
and
personal
care
than
the
smoking
of
tobacco
or
any
of
the
allied
vices
to
cut
the
nut
neatly
an
instrument
is
used
like
an
enormous
pair
of
nutcrackers
with
a
sharp
cutting
edge
the
lime
should
be
made
from
oyster
shells
and
it
must
be
freshly
burned
and
slaked
exposure
to
the
air
soon
spoils
it
so
a
small
tin
box
is
required
to
keep
it
in
lastly
the
betel
leaf
must
be
fresh
and
in
a
hot
climate
green
leaves
do
not
keep
their
freshness
without
special
care
but
the
necessity
for
attending
to
all
these
matters
no
doubt
adds
greatly
to
the
interest
which
a
chewer
of
is
able
to
find
in
life
moreover
his
taste
and
wealth
have
scope
for
expression
in
the
elegance
of
his
appointments
and
by
these
you
may
generally
judge
of
a
man
rank
and
means
a
mahratta
cartman
will
carry
in
his
waistband
a
sort
of
bijou
of
coloured
cloth
which
when
unrolled
displays
neat
pockets
of
different
forms
for
the
leaves
broken
nuts
lime
box
spices
etc
but
a
native
magistrate
who
goes
about
attended
by
a
peon
and
need
not
carry
his
own
things
will
have
a
box
of
polished
brass
or
even
silver
divided
into
compartments
one
may
easily
infer
that
to
meet
such
a
universal
want
there
must
be
a
correspondingly
great
industry
and
the
cultivation
of
the
betel
nut
is
indeed
a
great
industry
and
a
most
beautiful
one
surely
since
adam
first
began
to
till
the
ground
in
the
sweat
of
his
face
his
children
have
found
no
tillage
so
as
this
india
has
produced
no
virgil
to
take
the
common
charms
of
a
farmer
life
and
put
them
into
immortal
song
so
we
search
her
literature
in
vain
to
learn
how
her
simple
rustic
people
feel
about
these
things
and
in
what
we
see
of
their
life
there
is
little
sign
that
they
feel
about
them
at
all
but
when
the
englishman
wandering
gun
in
hand
up
a
steaming
valley
among
hills
suddenly
finds
the
path
lead
him
into
a
betel
nut
garden
with
no
wire
fence
or
locked
gate
or
inhospitable
notice
threatening
prosecution
to
trespassers
he
feels
as
if
he
had
entered
some
region
of
bliss
where
the
earthly
senses
are
too
narrow
for
the
delights
that
press
for
entrance
to
the
soul
in
the
first
place
the
areca
nut
palm
is
almost
if
not
altogether
the
most
graceful
of
all
its
graceful
tribe
unlike
the
coconut
it
grows
as
erect
as
a
flagstaff
and
the
effect
of
this
is
increased
by
its
extreme
slenderness
for
though
it
may
attain
a
height
of
fifty
feet
its
diameter
scarcely
exceeds
six
inches
at
the
top
of
the
stem
there
is
a
sheath
of
polished
green
from
the
top
of
which
again
there
issues
a
tuft
of
the
most
ethereal
feathery
fronds
diverging
and
drooping
with
matchless
grace
under
these
hang
the
clusters
of
nuts
as
the
areca
nut
will
not
grow
except
in
places
that
are
at
once
moist
and
warm
the
gardens
are
generally
situated
in
narrow
valleys
and
dells
among
hills
with
little
streams
of
limpid
water
rippling
past
them
or
through
them
the
steaming
heat
of
such
situations
can
only
be
realised
by
one
who
has
traversed
them
at
noon
in
the
month
of
may
in
pursuit
of
sport
or
natural
history
but
the
palms
grow
so
close
together
that
their
fronds
mingle
into
an
almost
unbroken
roof
through
which
the
sun
can
scarcely
peep
and
every
air
that
enters
there
has
the
heat
charmed
out
of
it
and
as
it
wanders
among
the
broad
aromatic
leaves
of
the
betel
vines
which
wreathe
the
pillars
of
that
fairy
hall
it
is
softened
with
balmy
moisture
and
laden
with
fragrance
and
scent
to
woo
your
senses
in
perfect
tune
with
the
tinkling
music
of
the
water
and
the
enchanting
beauty
of
the
whole
scene
in
a
large
hut
among
these
shades
with
bananas
waving
their
banner
leaves
over
the
smooth
and
yard
in
front
where
the
children
play
lives
the
family
that
cultivates
the
garden
they
are
a
sect
of
brahmins
but
very
unbrahminical
unsophisticated
industrious
temperate
kind
and
hospitable
other
brahmins
despise
them
and
wish
to
deny
them
the
name
because
they
have
soiled
their
priestly
hands
with
agriculture
but
they
return
the
contempt
and
walk
in
the
way
of
their
fathers
a
way
which
leads
them
among
the
purest
pleasures
that
this
life
affords
and
keeps
them
from
many
of
its
more
sordid
temptations
perhaps
the
picture
has
its
darker
shades
too
i
have
not
seen
them
and
why
should
i
look
for
them
the
betel
nut
harvest
is
something
of
the
nature
of
an
acrobatic
performance
for
the
crop
is
not
on
the
ground
but
on
poles
forty
or
fifty
feet
high
this
is
the
manner
in
which
it
is
gathered
the
farmer
attended
by
his
wife
goes
out
and
slipping
a
loose
loop
of
rope
over
his
feet
to
keep
them
together
so
that
when
he
gets
the
trunk
of
a
tree
between
them
it
may
fit
like
a
wedge
he
clasps
one
of
the
trees
with
his
hands
and
goes
up
at
a
surprising
rate
he
carries
with
him
a
long
rope
and
when
he
reaches
the
top
he
fastens
one
end
of
it
to
the
tree
and
throws
the
other
to
his
wife
who
goes
to
a
distance
and
draws
it
tight
then
the
man
breaks
off
a
heavy
bunch
of
ripe
nuts
and
hitching
it
on
the
rope
lets
it
go
it
shoots
down
with
such
velocity
that
it
would
knock
his
wife
down
did
she
not
know
how
to
dodge
it
skilfully
and
break
its
force
in
a
bend
of
the
rope
when
all
the
bunches
are
on
the
ground
the
man
begins
to
sway
his
body
violently
till
the
tender
and
supple
palm
is
swinging
like
a
pendulum
and
almost
striking
the
trees
on
either
side
watching
his
opportunity
the
man
grasps
one
of
these
and
transfers
himself
to
it
with
the
nimbleness
of
a
monkey
in
this
way
he
makes
an
aerial
journey
round
the
garden
and
avoids
the
fatigue
of
climbing
up
and
down
every
separate
tree
the
gathered
betel
nuts
soon
find
their
way
to
the
warehouses
of
fat
bunias
at
the
coast
ports
where
they
are
peeled
and
prepared
and
sorted
and
piled
in
great
heaps
according
to
quality
and
finally
shipped
in
and
and
coasting
steamers
and
so
disseminated
over
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
to
be
the
comforters
of
poor
and
rich
it
only
remains
to
say
that
the
betel
nut
is
not
used
in
the
east
for
though
the
natives
believe
that
the
practice
of
chewing
it
saves
them
from
toothache
when
they
use
any
dentifrice
it
is
generally
charcoal
and
their
toothbrush
is
either
the
forefinger
or
a
fibrous
stick
chewed
at
the
end
till
it
becomes
like
a
stiff
paintbrush
but
whatever
he
may
use
for
the
purpose
the
hindu
cleans
his
teeth
every
morning
and
that
most
thoroughly
before
he
will
allow
food
to
pass
his
lips
and
the
whiteness
and
soundness
of
his
teeth
are
an
object
of
envy
to
englishmen
xvii
a
hindu
festival
poets
may
sing
let
the
ape
and
tiger
die
but
they
are
not
quite
dead
yet
only
caged
and
where
is
the
man
in
whose
bosom
there
lurks
no
wish
that
he
could
open
the
door
just
once
in
a
way
and
let
them
have
a
frisk
in
the
east
there
is
no
hypocrisy
about
the
matter
the
tiger
den
is
barred
and
locked
and
the
british
government
keeps
the
key
but
the
ape
has
an
appointed
day
in
the
year
on
which
he
shall
have
his
outing
they
call
it
the
which
is
a
misnomer
for
of
all
hindu
festivals
this
is
the
most
unholy
but
of
that
anon
i
asked
a
brahmin
what
this
festival
commemorated
and
he
said
he
did
not
know
he
knew
how
to
observe
it
which
was
the
main
thing
of
course
there
is
an
explanation
of
it
in
hindu
mythology
which
the
brahmin
ought
to
have
known
and
very
probably
did
know
but
was
ashamed
to
tell
but
it
matters
little
for
we
may
be
well
assured
that
the
explanation
was
invented
to
sanctify
the
festival
long
after
the
festival
itself
came
into
vogue
as
has
been
the
case
with
some
of
our
most
christian
holidays
the
holi
comes
round
about
the
time
of
the
vernal
equinox
when
victory
declares
for
day
and
warmth
in
its
long
struggle
with
night
and
cold
then
nature
rises
and
shakes
herself
as
samson
rose
and
shook
himself
and
snapped
the
seven
new
cords
that
bound
him
as
tow
is
snapped
when
it
smells
the
fire
then
the
wanton
lapwing
gets
himself
another
crest
and
then
also
the
young
hindu
fancy
lightly
turns
to
thoughts
of
love
and
so
it
came
about
quite
naturally
that
looking
around
among
his
plentiful
gods
for
a
deity
who
might
fitly
be
invited
to
preside
over
his
lusty
rejoicings
at
this
season
he
pitched
upon
krishna
for
krishna
when
he
was
upon
this
earth
was
an
amorous
youth
and
his
goings
on
with
certain
milkmaids
were
such
as
would
shock
grundy
at
the
present
day
even
in
india
supposing
he
had
been
only
a
man
but
he
was
a
god
therefore
his
doing
a
thing
made
it
right
and
where
he
presides
his
worshippers
may
do
as
he
did
consequently
man
woman
and
child
of
every
caste
and
grade
give
themselves
licence
during
these
days
of
the
holi
to
act
and
speak
in
a
manner
that
would
be
scandalous
at
any
other
time
of
the
year
hindus
of
the
better
sort
are
beginning
to
be
outwardly
and
some
of
them
i
hope
inwardly
rather
ashamed
of
this
festival
and
it
is
time
they
were
yet
there
is
always
something
cheering
in
the
sight
of
untutored
mirth
and
exuberant
animal
joy
breaking
out
and
triumphing
over
the
sadness
of
life
and
the
monotony
of
lowly
toil
and
i
confess
that
i
find
a
pleasing
side
to
this
festival
of
the
holi
i
like
it
best
as
i
have
seen
it
in
a
fishing
village
on
the
west
coast
of
india
at
first
sight
you
would
not
suspect
the
black
and
brawny
koli
of
much
gaiety
but
there
is
deep
down
in
him
a
spring
of
mirth
and
humour
which
when
wine
and
free
companions
kindle
him
can
break
out
into
the
most
boisterous
hilarity
and
jocundity
and
even
buffoonery
throwing
aside
all
trammels
of
convention
and
decorum
his
women
folk
too
though
they
do
not
go
out
of
their
proper
place
in
the
social
system
assert
themselves
vigorously
within
it
and
are
gay
and
vivacious
and
well
aware
of
their
personal
attractions
so
the
koli
village
looks
forward
to
the
holi
and
makes
timely
preparation
for
it
the
night
before
the
or
full
moon
of
the
month
phalgoon
arrives
each
trim
fishing
boat
is
stored
with
flowers
and
leafy
branches
all
the
flags
that
can
be
mustered
and
a
drum
then
the
whole
village
goes
next
morning
each
housewife
gets
up
early
to
decorate
her
house
and
trick
out
herself
and
her
children
for
though
the
koli
is
the
most
naked
of
men
his
whole
workaday
costume
consisting
of
one
rag
about
equal
in
amplitude
to
half
a
good
his
wife
is
the
most
dressy
of
women
she
is
always
even
on
common
days
the
bareness
of
her
limbs
may
perhaps
shock
our
notions
of
propriety
at
first
for
being
a
of
necessity
like
the
stork
and
the
heron
she
girds
her
garments
about
her
very
tightly
indeed
but
this
only
sets
off
her
wonderfully
erect
and
athletic
figure
while
her
head
looks
all
the
nicer
that
it
has
no
covering
except
her
own
hair
she
never
draws
her
coyly
over
her
head
like
other
native
women
when
she
meets
a
man
on
this
day
there
is
no
change
in
the
fashion
of
her
costume
that
never
changes
but
she
puts
on
her
brightest
dress
blue
or
red
or
lemon
yellow
with
all
her
private
jewellery
and
decks
her
hair
with
a
small
chaplet
of
bright
flowers
her
children
are
tricked
out
with
more
fancy
the
little
brown
girl
who
yesterday
had
not
one
square
inch
of
cloth
on
the
whole
of
her
tiny
person
comes
out
a
miss
in
a
crimson
bodice
and
a
white
skirt
with
her
shining
black
hair
oiled
and
combed
and
plaited
and
decked
with
flowers
and
her
neck
and
arms
and
feet
twinkling
with
ornaments
her
brother
of
six
or
seven
looks
as
if
he
were
going
to
a
ball
in
the
character
of
his
highness
the
holkar
his
small
head
is
set
in
a
great
maratha
turban
and
his
body
a
stranger
to
the
feel
of
clothes
is
masked
in
a
resplendent
purple
jacket
the
young
men
of
the
village
such
of
them
as
are
not
gone
have
donned
clean
white
jackets
beyond
that
they
will
not
go
contemning
effeminacy
about
nine
when
the
sun
is
now
well
up
the
distant
sound
of
a
is
heard
and
the
first
of
the
returning
fleet
of
appears
at
the
mouth
of
the
creek
a
long
line
of
red
and
white
flags
extends
from
the
top
of
the
mainyard
to
the
helm
and
streamers
flutter
from
the
mastheads
a
monster
bouquet
of
marigolds
is
mounted
on
the
bowsprit
branches
of
trees
are
stuck
about
in
all
possible
situations
and
three
or
four
large
fishes
hang
from
the
bow
trailing
their
tails
in
the
water
with
the
exception
of
the
man
at
the
helm
who
sits
stolid
minding
his
business
and
one
youth
who
plays
the
the
crew
are
standing
in
a
ring
gesticulating
with
their
arms
and
legs
or
waving
wands
and
branches
of
trees
some
have
half
of
their
faces
smeared
with
red
paint
if
a
boat
passes
they
greet
it
with
a
shout
and
a
sally
of
wit
or
ribaldry
the
other
follow
close
behind
with
every
inch
of
white
sail
spread
and
all
with
flags
and
streamers
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
a
prettier
spectacle
and
the
and
the
happiness
beaming
on
the
faces
of
the
crews
are
almost
infectious
one
feels
almost
compelled
to
wave
one
hat
and
cry
hip
hip
hooray
the
boats
come
to
shore
and
then
there
ought
to
be
a
tumbling
out
of
the
silvery
harvest
and
a
gathering
of
women
and
a
strife
indescribable
of
shrill
tongues
and
then
a
long
procession
of
wives
and
daughters
trotting
to
market
each
balancing
a
great
dripping
basket
on
her
comely
head
while
the
husbands
and
fathers
go
home
to
eat
and
sleep
but
there
is
none
of
that
the
silvery
harvest
may
go
to
destruction
and
the
husbands
and
fathers
can
do
without
sleep
for
once
the
children
are
taken
on
board
in
all
their
finery
and
friends
join
and
musicians
with
their
instruments
then
all
sails
are
spread
again
and
the
boats
start
for
a
circuit
round
the
harbour
the
wind
blows
fiercely
from
the
north
and
each
buoyant
scuds
along
at
a
fearful
pace
heeling
over
until
the
rippling
water
fingers
the
edge
of
the
gunwale
as
if
it
were
just
getting
ready
to
leap
over
and
take
possession
but
the
hilarious
koli
balances
himself
on
the
sloping
thwarts
and
jumps
and
sings
and
claps
his
hands
while
the
pipes
screech
and
the
drums
rattle
twice
or
three
times
does
the
whole
fleet
go
out
over
the
bar
and
wheel
and
return
each
boat
racing
to
be
first
with
no
more
sense
of
danger
than
a
porpoise
at
play
at
last
they
have
had
enough
the
sails
are
furled
and
the
boats
beached
the
big
fishes
are
taken
down
from
the
bows
and
the
whole
crowd
with
their
trophies
and
garlands
dance
their
way
to
the
village
there
it
is
better
that
we
leave
them
great
fires
will
be
lighted
in
the
middle
of
the
main
road
and
capacious
pots
of
toddy
will
be
at
hand
and
every
merry
koli
will
get
hilariously
drunk
and
do
and
say
things
which
we
had
better
not
see
and
hear
and
the
children
will
look
on
and
try
to
imitate
their
elders
and
women
will
find
it
best
to
keep
out
of
the
way
for
the
sake
of
their
pretty
dresses
if
there
were
no
better
reason
for
pots
of
water
dyed
crimson
with
powder
are
ready
and
everybody
has
licence
to
splash
everybody
when
he
gets
a
chance
any
time
during
the
next
two
or
three
days
you
may
find
your
own
servants
coming
home
dappled
with
red
so
the
ape
has
his
fling
and
the
tiger
is
lurking
not
far
behind
in
each
of
those
fires
it
is
the
proper
thing
to
roast
a
cock
throwing
him
in
alive
if
the
fire
is
a
great
one
a
general
village
fire
then
it
is
still
greater
fun
to
throw
in
a
live
goat
but
the
worst
of
these
ceremonies
are
happily
going
out
of
fashion
for
the
english
law
is
stern
and
the
have
strange
and
quixotic
notions
about
cruelty
to
animals
and
although
they
are
far
away
on
tour
at
this
season
and
no
native
officer
would
voluntarily
interfere
with
an
immemorial
custom
still
the
tiger
walks
in
fear
in
these
days
and
the
koli
is
often
content
to
roast
a
coconut
as
proxy
for
a
cock
or
a
goat
xviii
indian
poverty
the
standard
of
living
when
keir
hardie
was
in
india
he
satisfied
himself
that
the
standard
of
living
among
the
working
classes
in
india
has
been
deteriorating
this
is
interesting
psychologically
and
one
would
like
to
know
by
what
means
keir
hardie
attained
to
satisfaction
on
such
a
great
and
important
question
doubtless
he
had
the
ungrudging
assistance
of
chowdry
the
poverty
of
india
has
for
a
good
many
years
been
a
handy
weapon
like
the
sailor
belaying
pin
for
everyone
who
wanted
to
have
at
our
administration
of
that
country
and
if
a
lie
which
is
half
a
truth
is
ever
the
blackest
of
lies
then
this
one
must
be
as
black
as
tartarus
for
it
is
indubitably
more
than
half
a
truth
the
common
in
india
is
about
as
poor
as
man
can
be
he
is
very
nearly
as
poor
as
a
sparrow
his
hut
built
by
himself
is
scarcely
more
substantial
or
permanent
than
the
sparrow
nest
and
his
clothing
compares
very
unfavourably
with
the
sparrow
feathers
the
residue
of
his
worldly
goods
consists
of
a
few
cooking
pots
and
it
must
be
admitted
a
few
ornaments
on
his
wife
but
a
sparrow
is
usually
well
fed
and
quite
happy
it
has
no
property
simply
because
it
wants
none
if
it
stored
honey
like
the
busy
bee
or
nuts
like
the
thrifty
squirrel
it
would
be
a
prey
to
constant
anxiety
and
stand
in
hourly
danger
of
being
plundered
of
its
possessions
and
perhaps
killed
for
the
sake
of
them
therefore
to
speak
of
a
poverty
as
if
it
certainly
implied
want
and
unhappiness
is
mere
misrepresentation
born
of
ignorance
in
all
ages
there
have
been
men
so
enamoured
of
the
possessionless
life
that
they
have
abandoned
their
worldly
goods
and
formed
brotherhoods
pledged
to
lifelong
poverty
the
majority
of
religious
beggars
in
india
belong
to
brotherhoods
of
this
kind
and
are
the
sturdiest
and
men
to
be
seen
in
the
country
especially
in
time
of
famine
but
the
hindu
peasant
is
not
a
begging
friar
and
may
be
supposed
to
have
some
share
of
the
love
of
money
which
is
common
to
humanity
so
it
is
worth
while
to
inquire
why
he
is
normally
so
very
poor
there
are
two
reasons
both
of
which
are
so
obvious
and
have
so
often
been
pointed
out
by
those
who
have
known
him
best
that
there
is
little
excuse
for
overlooking
them
the
first
of
them
is
thus
stated
in
tennant
written
in
before
british
rule
had
affected
the
people
of
india
much
in
one
direction
or
another
industry
can
hardly
be
ranked
among
their
virtues
among
all
classes
it
is
necessity
of
subsistence
and
not
choice
that
urges
to
labour
a
native
will
not
earn
six
rupees
a
month
by
working
a
few
hours
more
if
he
can
live
upon
three
and
if
he
has
three
he
will
not
work
at
all
such
was
the
hindu
a
century
ago
in
the
eyes
of
an
observant
and
judicious
man
studying
him
with
all
the
sympathetic
interest
of
novelty
and
such
he
is
now
the
other
reason
for
the
chronic
poverty
of
the
indian
peasant
is
that
if
he
had
money
beyond
his
immediate
necessity
he
could
not
keep
it
it
is
the
despair
of
the
government
of
india
and
of
every
english
official
who
endeavours
to
improve
his
condition
that
he
can
not
keep
his
land
or
his
cattle
or
anything
else
on
which
his
permanent
welfare
depends
the
following
extract
from
reminiscences
of
an
indian
police
gives
a
lively
picture
of
the
effect
of
unaccustomed
wealth
not
on
peasants
but
on
farmers
owning
land
and
cattle
and
used
to
something
like
comfort
yellapa
like
all
cotton
growers
in
that
part
of
the
western
presidency
profited
enormously
by
the
high
price
of
the
staple
during
the
american
war
silver
was
poured
into
the
country
literally
in
millions
sterling
and
cultivators
who
previously
had
as
much
as
they
could
do
to
live
suddenly
found
themselves
possessed
of
sums
their
imagination
had
never
dreamt
of
what
to
do
with
their
wealth
how
to
spend
their
cash
was
their
problem
having
laden
their
women
and
children
with
ornaments
and
decked
them
out
in
expensive
they
launched
into
the
wildest
extravagance
in
the
matter
of
carts
and
trotting
bullocks
going
even
as
far
as
yokes
and
harness
studded
with
silver
mountings
even
silver
tyres
to
the
wheels
became
the
fashion
twelve
and
fifteen
rupees
were
eagerly
paid
for
a
pair
of
trotting
bullocks
trotting
matches
for
large
stakes
were
common
and
the
whole
rural
population
appeared
with
expensive
red
silk
umbrellas
which
an
enterprising
english
firm
imported
as
likely
to
gratify
the
general
taste
for
display
many
took
to
drink
not
country
liquors
such
as
had
satisfied
them
previously
but
british
brandy
rum
gin
and
even
champagne
a
few
pages
further
on
the
author
tells
us
of
the
ruin
by
debt
and
drunkenness
of
the
families
which
had
indulged
in
these
extravagances
the
fact
is
that
to
keep
for
what
is
in
the
hand
demands
imagination
purpose
and
which
the
hindu
working
man
has
not
he
is
the
product
of
centuries
during
which
his
rulers
made
the
life
of
too
uncertain
while
his
climate
made
the
life
of
too
easy
no
outward
applications
will
alone
cure
his
poverty
because
it
is
a
symptom
of
an
inward
disease
when
a
healthier
state
of
mind
shall
awaken
an
appetite
for
comforts
and
conveniences
and
create
necessities
unknown
to
his
fathers
then
degrading
poverty
will
no
longer
be
possible
as
the
common
lot
and
it
was
to
be
hoped
that
the
british
rule
would
in
time
have
this
happy
effect
tennant
evidently
thought
that
it
had
begun
to
do
so
even
in
his
day
the
existence
he
says
of
a
regular
british
government
is
but
a
recent
circumstance
yet
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
complete
security
has
been
afforded
to
all
of
its
dependants
many
new
manufactures
have
been
established
many
more
have
been
extended
to
answer
the
demands
of
a
larger
exportation
we
have
therefore
conferred
upon
our
asiatic
subjects
an
increase
of
security
of
industry
and
of
produce
and
of
consequent
greater
means
of
enjoyment
it
is
therefore
a
very
grave
charge
that
keir
hardie
brings
against
the
british
administration
when
he
says
a
century
after
these
words
were
written
that
the
standard
of
living
among
the
hindu
peasantry
has
deteriorated
happily
there
does
not
appear
to
have
been
a
close
relation
between
facts
and
keir
hardie
conclusions
during
his
indian
tour
so
we
may
continue
to
put
our
confidence
in
the
many
hopeful
indications
that
exist
of
a
distinct
improvement
in
the
ideal
of
life
which
has
so
long
prevailed
among
our
poor
indian
the
rise
in
the
wages
of
both
skilled
and
unskilled
labour
during
even
the
last
thirty
years
especially
in
and
near
important
towns
has
been
most
remarkable
it
is
more
to
the
point
to
know
what
the
labourer
is
able
to
do
and
actually
does
with
his
wages
and
here
the
returns
of
trade
and
the
reports
of
the
railway
companies
post
office
and
savings
bank
have
striking
evidence
to
offer
they
are
published
annually
and
anyone
even
keir
hardie
may
consult
them
who
likes
his
facts
in
statistical
form
for
those
who
live
in
india
there
are
abundant
evidences
with
more
colour
in
them
some
thirty
years
ago
or
more
there
was
a
steamship
company
in
bombay
owning
two
small
steamers
which
carried
passengers
across
the
harbour
by
degrees
it
extended
its
operations
and
increased
its
fleet
until
it
had
a
daily
service
of
fast
steamers
with
accommodation
for
nearly
a
thousand
passengers
which
went
down
the
coast
as
far
as
goa
calling
at
every
petty
port
on
the
way
the
head
of
the
firm
retired
some
years
ago
having
made
his
pile
seldom
has
a
more
profitable
enterprise
been
started
in
bombay
and
whence
did
the
profits
come
from
the
pockets
of
hindu
peasants
the
mahrattas
of
the
ratnagiri
district
supply
most
of
the
labour
required
in
bombay
and
for
these
the
company
spread
its
nets
and
by
their
incessant
coming
and
going
it
amassed
its
wealth
heads
of
mercantile
firms
and
government
offices
and
all
who
have
to
deal
with
the
mahratta
puttiwala
viewed
its
success
without
surprise
though
always
grumbling
at
his
wages
he
never
appears
to
be
without
the
means
and
the
will
to
travel
a
marriage
a
religious
ceremony
in
his
family
or
the
death
of
some
relative
requires
his
immediate
presence
in
his
village
and
he
asks
for
leave
if
he
can
not
get
it
otherwise
he
offers
to
forfeit
his
pay
for
the
period
if
it
is
still
refused
he
resigns
his
situation
and
goes
this
does
not
indicate
pinching
poverty
there
must
be
some
margin
between
such
men
and
starvation
and
a
saunter
through
their
villages
will
amply
confirm
such
a
surmise
it
is
no
uncommon
thing
in
these
coast
villages
to
see
that
foreign
luxury
a
chair
perhaps
even
an
in
the
verandah
of
a
common
bhundaree
the
rapidly
growing
use
of
chairs
glass
tumblers
enamelled
ironware
and
lemonade
patent
medicines
and
even
cheap
watches
declares
plainly
that
the
young
hindu
of
the
present
day
does
not
live
as
his
fathers
did
men
go
better
dressed
and
their
children
are
clothed
at
an
earlier
age
the
advertisements
in
vernacular
languages
that
one
meets
with
circulated
and
posted
up
in
all
sorts
of
places
tell
the
same
tale
convincingly
for
the
advertiser
knows
his
business
and
will
not
angle
where
no
fish
rise
nor
are
large
towns
like
bombay
the
only
places
where
the
hindu
peasant
widens
his
horizon
and
acquires
new
tastes
in
the
fiji
islands
there
are
about
natives
of
india
who
went
out
as
indentured
coolies
with
the
option
of
returning
at
the
end
of
five
years
at
their
own
expense
or
after
ten
years
at
that
of
government
when
these
men
come
home
they
bring
with
them
new
tastes
and
new
ideas
as
well
as
the
habit
of
saving
money
and
thousands
of
rupees
saved
during
their
short
exile
in
mauritius
and
south
africa
the
hindu
working
man
is
learning
the
same
lessons
when
he
gets
back
to
the
sleepy
life
of
his
native
village
he
is
not
likely
to
settle
down
contentedly
at
the
level
from
which
he
started
on
every
hand
in
short
forces
are
at
work
stirring
discontent
in
the
breasts
of
the
younger
generation
with
the
existence
which
was
the
heritage
of
their
fathers
these
forces
operate
from
the
outside
and
the
mass
is
large
and
very
inert
it
would
be
rash
to
say
that
in
the
heart
of
it
there
are
not
still
millions
who
regard
a
monotonous
struggle
for
a
bare
existence
as
their
portion
from
providence
but
when
a
man
who
has
travelled
in
india
for
half
a
cold
season
tells
us
that
the
standard
of
living
in
india
has
deteriorated
we
are
tempted
to
quote
from
sir
ali
baba
what
is
it
that
these
travelling
people
put
on
paper
let
me
put
it
in
the
form
of
a
conundrum
q
what
is
it
that
the
travelling
treasures
up
and
the
hastens
to
throw
away
a
erroneous
hazy
distorted
impressions
one
of
the
most
serious
duties
attending
a
residence
in
india
is
the
correcting
of
those
misapprehensions
which
your
travelling
sacrifices
his
bath
to
hustle
upon
paper
xix
borrowed
indian
words
of
the
results
of
the
roman
supremacy
in
britain
none
have
been
so
permanent
as
their
influence
on
our
language
no
doubt
this
was
less
due
to
any
direct
effect
that
their
residence
among
the
britons
had
at
the
time
on
vernacular
speech
than
to
the
fact
that
for
many
centuries
after
their
departure
latin
was
the
language
throughout
europe
of
literature
and
scholarship
our
supremacy
in
india
is
acting
on
the
languages
of
that
country
in
both
ways
and
though
it
has
scarcely
lasted
half
as
long
yet
as
the
roman
rule
in
britain
english
already
bids
fair
to
become
one
day
the
common
tongue
of
the
hindus
but
there
is
also
a
current
flowing
the
other
way
comparatively
insignificant
but
curious
and
interesting
few
persons
in
england
are
aware
how
often
they
use
words
of
indian
origin
in
common
speech
in
attempting
to
give
a
list
of
these
i
will
exclude
the
trade
names
of
articles
of
indian
produce
or
manufacture
which
have
no
literary
interest
and
also
words
which
indicate
objects
ideas
or
customs
that
are
not
english
and
therefore
have
no
english
equivalents
such
as
sepoy
and
suttee
i
will
also
omit
indian
words
such
as
bundobust
and
griffin
which
are
used
by
writers
like
thackeray
in
the
same
way
in
which
french
terms
are
commonly
introduced
into
english
composition
of
course
it
is
not
always
possible
to
draw
a
hard
and
fast
line
there
are
words
which
first
came
into
england
as
the
trade
names
of
indian
products
but
have
extended
their
significance
or
entirely
changed
it
and
taken
a
permanent
place
in
the
english
language
pepper
still
means
what
it
originally
meant
but
it
has
also
become
a
verb
another
example
is
shawl
a
word
which
has
lost
all
trace
of
its
oriental
origin
it
is
a
pure
hindustani
word
pronounced
shal
and
indicating
an
article
thus
described
in
the
seventeenth
century
by
thevenot
as
quoted
in
une
chal
qui
est
une
maniere
de
toilette
laine
très
fine
qui
se
fait
a
cachmir
with
the
article
to
england
came
the
name
but
soon
spread
itself
over
all
fabrics
worn
in
the
same
fashion
except
the
scotch
plaid
which
held
its
own
somewhat
similar
is
calico
originally
a
fine
cotton
cloth
imported
from
calicut
this
place
is
called
calicot
by
the
natives
and
may
have
dropped
the
final
t
through
the
influence
of
french
dressmakers
chintz
is
another
example
being
the
hindustani
word
cheent
which
means
a
spotted
cotton
cloth
in
trade
fabrics
are
always
described
in
the
plural
and
the
z
in
chintz
is
no
doubt
a
perversion
through
misunderstanding
of
the
terminal
lac
is
another
indian
word
which
has
retained
its
own
meaning
but
it
has
gone
beyond
it
and
given
rise
to
a
verb
to
lacquer
with
these
perhaps
should
be
mentioned
pyjamas
and
shampoo
both
of
which
have
undergone
strange
perversions
pyjama
is
an
indian
name
for
loose
drawers
or
trousers
tied
with
a
cord
round
the
waist
such
as
mussulmans
of
both
sexes
wear
in
india
the
pyjama
was
long
ago
adopted
with
a
loose
coat
to
match
as
a
more
decent
and
comfortable
costume
than
the
british
nightshirt
and
when
retired
they
brought
the
fashion
home
with
them
english
tailors
called
the
whole
costume
a
pyjama
suit
but
the
second
word
was
soon
dropped
and
the
first
improved
into
the
plural
number
shampoo
comes
from
a
verb
champna
to
press
or
squeeze
and
the
imperative
champo
as
often
happens
was
the
form
in
which
it
became
english
forbes
in
his
writes
of
the
effects
of
opium
champoing
and
other
luxuries
indulged
in
by
oriental
sensualists
when
the
medical
profession
in
england
began
to
patronise
the
practice
it
assumed
a
more
dignified
name
massage
and
the
old
word
was
relegated
to
the
hairdressers
who
appropriated
it
to
the
washing
of
the
head
an
operation
with
which
the
word
has
no
proper
relation
at
all
there
are
two
words
of
doubtful
derivation
which
may
be
mentioned
in
this
connection
cot
in
the
sense
of
a
light
bed
or
cradle
is
not
much
used
in
england
but
is
given
in
webster
and
other
dictionaries
with
the
same
saxon
derivation
as
the
cot
beside
the
hill
which
the
poet
rogers
sighed
for
if
this
is
correct
then
it
is
at
least
curious
that
the
word
should
have
almost
gone
out
of
use
in
england
and
revived
in
india
from
a
distinct
root
there
it
is
the
term
in
use
for
any
rough
bedstead
such
as
the
natives
sleep
on
and
call
a
khat
the
average
englishman
can
not
aspirate
a
k
and
never
pronounces
the
indian
a
aright
unless
it
is
followed
by
an
r
so
khat
becomes
cot
by
a
process
of
which
there
are
many
illustrations
the
other
doubtful
word
mentioned
above
is
teapoy
it
is
defined
in
the
dictionaries
as
an
ornamental
table
with
a
folding
top
containing
caddies
for
holding
tea
but
in
india
where
it
is
in
much
more
general
use
than
it
is
in
england
it
signifies
simply
a
light
tripod
table
and
almost
certainly
comes
from
teenpai
corresponding
to
another
common
word
charpai
which
means
a
native
bedstead
the
fact
that
it
is
sometimes
spelled
tepoy
confirms
this
but
the
other
spelling
is
commoner
and
appears
to
have
led
to
its
getting
a
special
meaning
connected
with
tea
among
furniture
sellers
cheroot
bangle
curry
and
kidgeree
are
examples
of
words
which
have
come
to
us
with
the
things
which
they
signify
and
retain
their
meaning
though
the
thing
itself
may
have
undergone
some
change
curry
as
made
in
england
is
sometimes
not
recognisable
by
a
new
arrival
from
india
and
kidgeree
is
applied
to
a
preparation
of
rice
and
fish
whereas
it
means
properly
a
dish
of
rice
split
peas
and
butter
or
ghee
fish
may
be
eaten
with
it
but
is
not
an
ingredient
of
it
bazaar
may
be
classed
with
these
words
and
also
polo
which
is
merely
the
name
for
a
polo
ball
in
the
language
of
one
of
the
himalayan
tribes
from
whom
we
learned
the
game
it
is
said
to
have
been
played
in
england
for
the
first
time
at
aldershot
in
more
interest
attaches
to
gymkhana
for
neither
the
word
nor
the
thing
which
it
signifies
is
indian
though
both
originated
in
india
and
the
derivation
of
the
word
is
unknown
though
it
is
scarcely
fifty
years
old
several
hybrid
derivations
have
been
suggested
none
of
them
probable
and
i
lean
to
the
suggestion
that
the
of
the
word
may
have
been
jumkhana
a
term
which
though
it
is
not
in
forbes
dictionary
i
have
heard
a
native
apply
to
a
large
cotton
carpet
such
as
native
acrobats
or
wrestlers
might
spread
when
about
to
give
a
performance
our
use
of
the
words
arena
stage
boards
footlights
shows
how
easily
a
carpet
might
give
name
to
a
place
of
meeting
for
athletic
exercises
there
is
another
class
of
words
which
have
come
into
england
through
returned
and
spread
by
their
own
merit
one
of
these
is
loot
the
dictionary
says
that
it
means
to
plunder
but
it
holds
more
than
that
or
any
equivalent
english
word
perhaps
it
has
scarcely
risen
above
the
level
of
slang
yet
but
the
phrase
to
run
amuck
is
classical
having
been
used
by
both
pope
and
dryden
the
pedantic
attempt
made
by
some
writers
to
change
the
common
way
of
writing
it
because
the
original
malay
term
is
a
single
word
amok
comes
too
late
in
view
of
dryden
line
and
runs
an
indian
muck
at
all
he
meets
cheese
in
the
sense
of
a
thing
or
rather
of
the
very
thing
must
be
ranked
as
slang
too
though
very
common
the
slang
dictionaries
give
fanciful
derivations
from
roots
or
suggest
that
it
is
a
perversion
of
chose
but
it
is
a
common
hindustani
word
for
a
thing
and
when
an
englishman
in
india
finds
some
article
which
exactly
suits
his
purpose
and
exclaims
ah
that
the
cheese
no
one
needs
to
ask
the
derivation
if
it
did
not
come
to
us
directly
from
india
then
it
came
through
the
gipsies
for
it
is
one
of
the
many
hindustani
words
which
occur
in
their
language
another
word
that
came
from
india
indirectly
is
caste
but
it
is
of
portuguese
origin
the
early
portuguese
writers
applied
it
casta
to
the
hereditary
division
of
hindu
society
and
the
english
adopted
it
it
has
now
become
indispensable
we
have
no
other
word
that
could
take
its
place
in
the
lines
her
manners
had
not
that
repose
which
stamps
the
caste
of
vere
de
vere
i
must
close
with
two
familiar
words
which
have
been
so
long
with
us
that
few
who
use
them
ever
suspect
that
they
came
from
the
east
namely
punch
and
toddy
the
rev
ovington
who
sailed
to
bombay
in
in
the
ship
that
carried
the
glad
news
of
the
coronation
of
william
and
mary
tells
us
that
in
the
east
india
company
chief
factory
at
surat
the
common
table
was
supplied
with
plenty
of
generous
sherash
shiraz
wine
and
arak
punch
arrack
properly
urk
sometimes
abbreviated
to
rack
means
any
distilled
spirit
or
essence
but
is
commonly
used
to
distinguish
country
liquor
from
imported
spirits
the
company
factors
drank
it
because
european
wines
and
beer
were
at
that
time
very
expensive
in
india
and
to
reconcile
it
to
their
palates
they
made
it
into
a
brew
called
punch
from
the
indian
word
panch
meaning
five
because
it
contained
five
ingredients
viz
arrack
hot
water
limes
sugar
and
spice
this
was
the
ordinary
drink
of
poor
englishmen
in
india
for
a
longtime
and
public
existed
in
every
settlement
of
the
east
india
company
now
one
of
the
principal
substances
from
which
country
liquor
is
distilled
is
palm
juice
the
native
name
for
which
tadee
has
been
perverted
into
toddy
as
in
the
case
of
cot
and
toddy
punch
meant
the
same
thing
as
arrack
punch
returning
brought
the
receipt
for
making
this
brew
to
england
and
lovers
of
vanity
fair
will
remember
how
the
whole
course
of
that
story
was
changed
by
the
bowl
of
rack
punch
which
joseph
sedley
ordered
at
vauxhall
where
everybody
had
rack
punch
how
soon
both
the
brew
and
its
indian
name
took
firm
root
and
spread
among
us
appears
from
the
fact
that
at
the
holy
fair
described
by
burns
in
the
century
before
last
the
lads
and
lasses
sit
round
a
table
and
steer
about
the
toddy
