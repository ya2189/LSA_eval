the
inner
side
of
every
cloud
is
bright
and
shining
i
therefore
turn
my
clouds
about
and
always
wear
them
inside
out
to
show
the
lining
whitcomb
and
i
will
show
that
there
is
no
imperfection
in
the
present
and
can
be
none
in
the
future
and
i
will
show
that
whatever
happens
to
anybody
it
may
be
turned
to
beautiful
results
chapter
i
to
be
happy
though
married
some
dear
relatives
of
mine
proposed
ada
as
my
future
bride
i
like
ada
and
i
gladly
accepted
the
offer
and
i
mean
to
wed
her
about
the
middle
of
this
year
is
this
a
working
of
the
law
of
attraction
i
want
to
make
our
married
life
happy
and
peaceful
i
long
for
a
wedded
life
of
pure
blessedness
and
love
and
joy
without
even
a
pinhead
of
bitterness
ever
finding
lodgment
in
our
household
how
can
i
attain
this
state
of
peace
this
is
what
i
now
do
i
enter
into
the
silence
daily
at
a
particular
hour
and
enjoy
the
mental
picture
of
how
i
desire
to
be
when
married
am
i
right
please
tell
me
how
to
make
my
ideal
real
tudor
island
of
ceylon
the
above
letter
comes
from
a
member
of
the
success
circle
who
is
a
highly
cultured
and
interesting
looking
native
east
indian
we
have
a
full
length
photo
of
him
in
native
costume
he
asks
if
this
is
the
working
of
the
law
of
attraction
certainly
it
is
just
as
the
sun
acts
through
a
sheet
of
glass
so
the
law
of
attraction
acts
through
the
conventionalities
of
a
race
whatever
comes
together
is
drawn
together
by
the
law
whatever
is
held
together
is
held
by
that
same
law
of
attraction
this
is
just
as
true
in
unhappy
marriages
as
in
happy
ones
if
two
people
are
distinctly
enough
individualized
that
is
if
they
understand
and
command
themselves
sufficiently
their
attraction
and
marriage
will
bring
to
them
only
pleasure
if
they
are
not
distinctly
enough
individualized
there
will
be
a
experience
whilst
they
are
working
out
the
wisdom
which
they
were
when
soda
and
sour
milk
are
drawn
together
there
is
a
great
stew
and
fizz
but
the
end
thereof
is
sweetness
and
usefulness
so
with
two
adverse
and
uncontrolled
natures
but
out
of
the
stew
comes
added
wisdom
and
rounded
character
for
each
when
each
has
finished
the
work
of
helping
the
other
to
develop
they
will
either
find
themselves
in
love
with
each
other
or
they
will
fall
apart
stronger
attraction
will
separate
them
at
the
right
perhaps
through
divorce
perhaps
through
death
our
goings
and
comings
are
due
to
the
law
of
attraction
the
law
of
attraction
giveth
and
it
taketh
away
is
the
law
it
work
and
forget
not
that
things
are
due
to
its
working
this
does
not
mean
that
the
law
has
no
way
of
working
through
the
conventionalities
of
a
people
many
times
the
attraction
is
to
break
away
from
the
conventional
stronger
attraction
always
whatever
is
is
for
time
and
tudor
says
he
enters
into
the
silence
daily
at
a
particular
hour
and
enjoys
the
mental
picture
of
how
he
desires
to
be
when
married
his
success
all
depends
upon
the
in
that
picture
upon
its
truth
to
the
law
of
being
an
impractical
idealist
lives
in
the
silence
with
beautiful
pictures
of
how
he
desires
to
be
when
married
when
he
gets
married
there
is
a
single
detail
of
his
daily
experience
which
is
like
his
mental
picture
he
is
sadly
disappointed
and
perhaps
embittered
or
discouraged
it
all
depends
upon
the
picture
if
tudor
picture
contains
a
benignant
lord
and
master
and
a
sweet
little
alice
ben
bolt
sort
of
wife
who
shall
laugh
with
delight
when
he
gives
her
a
smile
and
would
hurt
his
feelings
for
a
farm
who
does
his
bidding
before
he
bids
and
is
always
content
with
what
he
is
pleased
or
able
to
do
for
her
if
this
is
the
style
of
tudor
mental
picture
he
is
certainly
doomed
to
disappointment
i
have
a
suspicion
that
tudor
is
a
natural
born
teacher
his
mental
pictures
may
represent
himself
as
a
dispenser
of
moral
and
mental
blessings
he
may
see
ada
sitting
adoringly
at
his
feet
ever
eager
to
learn
if
so
there
will
certainly
be
disappointment
east
indian
girls
may
be
more
docile
than
american
girls
east
indian
men
may
be
better
and
wiser
lords
and
masters
but
ada
is
a
human
being
before
she
is
an
east
indian
and
a
human
being
instinctively
revolts
from
a
life
passed
in
leading
strings
if
tudor
continues
to
remind
her
that
he
is
her
schoolmaster
she
will
certainly
revolt
inwardly
if
not
outwardly
whether
the
revolt
comes
inwardly
or
outwardly
harmony
is
doomed
the
first
principle
of
happy
marriage
is
the
second
principle
is
which
can
never
exist
without
the
first
i
do
not
mean
by
equality
what
is
usually
meant
one
member
of
the
married
twain
may
be
rich
the
other
poor
in
worldly
goods
one
an
aristocrat
the
other
plebeian
one
educated
the
other
unschooled
and
yet
they
may
be
to
each
other
what
they
are
in
equals
equality
is
a
not
a
matter
of
birth
or
breeding
wisdom
or
ignorance
the
truth
is
that
men
and
women
are
equal
all
are
sparks
of
the
one
life
all
children
of
the
one
highly
aristocratic
father
all
heirs
to
the
wisdom
and
wealth
of
the
ages
which
go
to
make
up
eternity
but
all
men
and
women
are
more
or
less
unconscious
in
spots
at
least
of
this
truth
they
spend
their
lives
looking
down
upon
each
other
men
look
down
upon
their
wives
as
weak
or
inferior
and
women
look
down
upon
their
husbands
as
animals
or
great
brutes
men
are
contemptuous
of
their
wives
visionariness
and
women
despise
their
husbands
for
cold
and
calculating
tendencies
every
man
and
woman
values
certain
qualities
highly
and
in
proportion
as
another
fails
to
manifest
these
particular
qualities
he
is
classed
as
low
and
his
society
is
not
valued
this
is
the
great
source
of
trouble
between
husbands
and
wives
each
values
his
or
her
own
qualities
and
despises
the
other
so
their
own
they
are
not
equal
and
the
first
principle
of
harmony
is
missing
the
real
truth
is
that
in
marriage
a
man
is
schoolmaster
to
his
wife
she
is
equally
schoolmistress
to
this
is
true
in
a
less
degree
of
the
relationships
of
life
the
law
of
attraction
draws
people
together
they
may
there
is
but
one
life
which
is
growth
in
wisdom
and
knowledge
there
is
but
one
death
is
refusal
to
if
husbands
and
wives
were
equals
their
own
they
would
not
despise
each
other
and
to
of
each
other
the
law
of
attraction
or
love
almost
invariably
attracts
opposites
and
for
their
own
good
a
visionary
idealistic
woman
is
drawn
to
a
practical
man
where
kick
and
fuss
and
despise
each
other
as
they
will
she
is
bound
to
become
more
practical
and
he
more
idealistic
they
exchange
qualities
in
spite
of
themselves
each
is
an
unconscious
agent
in
rounding
out
the
character
and
making
more
abundant
the
life
of
the
other
much
of
this
blending
of
natures
is
accomplished
through
passion
the
least
understood
of
forces
and
the
children
of
a
union
of
opposites
even
where
there
is
contempt
and
unhappiness
between
the
parents
are
almost
invariably
than
of
the
parents
i
can
not
believe
that
unhappy
marriages
are
mistakes
or
that
they
serve
no
good
purpose
the
law
of
attraction
draws
together
those
who
need
each
other
at
that
particular
stage
of
their
growth
the
unhappiness
is
due
to
their
own
foolish
to
learn
and
this
refusal
is
due
to
their
contempt
for
each
other
they
are
like
naughty
children
at
school
who
cry
or
sulk
and
refuse
to
work
out
their
problems
like
those
same
naughty
children
they
unhappy
and
fail
to
pass
as
soon
as
they
might
remember
that
contempt
for
each
other
is
at
the
very
bottom
of
all
marital
unhappiness
the
practical
man
despises
his
wife
impulsive
idealism
and
tries
to
make
her
over
the
wife
despises
his
cold
and
calculating
tendencies
and
tries
to
make
him
over
that
means
war
for
it
is
impossible
to
make
over
but
the
man
despises
his
wife
tendencies
and
she
despises
his
it
never
occurs
to
either
to
try
making
over
thus
helping
along
the
very
thing
they
were
drawn
together
for
if
tudor
picture
holds
two
people
who
are
equal
though
utterly
different
whose
future
actions
are
an
unknown
quantity
to
be
taken
as
they
come
and
each
action
to
be
met
in
a
spirit
of
and
inquiry
with
a
view
to
understanding
and
learning
from
it
if
over
and
through
all
his
picture
tudor
spreads
a
glow
of
to
preserve
respect
and
love
at
all
costs
if
this
is
the
sort
of
picture
tudor
makes
in
the
silence
he
will
surely
realize
it
later
it
requires
but
one
to
strike
the
keynote
of
respect
and
personal
freedom
in
marriage
the
other
will
soon
come
into
harmony
you
can
readily
see
that
all
marital
jars
come
from
this
lack
of
equality
in
the
individual
mind
if
a
man
thinks
he
is
perfectly
able
to
take
care
of
and
to
judge
for
himself
he
resents
interference
from
another
on
the
other
hand
if
he
believes
his
wife
is
equally
able
to
judge
for
he
thinks
of
interfering
with
her
actions
of
course
the
same
is
true
of
the
wife
it
is
lack
of
respect
and
confidence
which
begets
the
spirit
in
a
family
and
from
this
one
cause
arises
all
in
harmony
individual
freedom
is
the
basis
for
harmonious
action
not
only
in
marriage
but
in
all
other
relationships
of
life
and
individual
freedom
be
granted
by
the
man
or
woman
who
considers
his
or
her
judgments
superior
to
the
judgments
of
another
a
man
accord
his
wife
wisdom
and
power
with
himself
else
he
free
her
to
act
for
herself
a
woman
must
accord
her
husband
that
same
equality
or
she
leave
him
free
it
is
human
and
divine
nature
to
correct
what
we
believe
to
be
wrong
only
in
believing
that
the
other
king
or
queen
can
do
no
wrong
lies
the
possibility
of
individual
freedom
in
marriage
or
out
the
man
or
woman
who
knows
he
or
she
is
believed
in
and
trusted
is
very
careful
to
that
trust
did
you
know
that
the
sure
way
to
have
your
wishes
consulted
is
to
exalt
and
appreciate
the
other
party
did
you
know
that
a
man
or
woman
will
cheerfully
sacrifice
his
or
her
own
opinions
in
order
to
retain
the
respect
and
love
of
the
other
but
if
he
thinks
the
respect
and
love
of
the
other
party
is
growing
less
he
will
give
free
reign
to
his
own
desires
married
people
grow
apart
for
the
one
reason
that
they
find
fault
with
each
other
of
course
it
begins
by
their
being
disrespectful
to
each
other
faults
but
it
soon
develops
into
disrespect
of
each
other
from
looking
down
upon
a
husband
faults
it
is
only
a
few
short
steps
to
looking
down
upon
his
faults
keep
growing
by
recognition
and
his
good
points
keep
shrivelling
for
lack
of
notice
until
there
is
nothing
left
but
faults
from
trying
to
make
him
over
you
come
to
despair
and
give
him
up
as
an
altogether
bad
job
and
there
is
a
grain
of
sense
in
all
this
madness
stick
to
the
truth
and
you
will
get
rid
of
the
madness
and
the
friction
too
the
truth
is
that
your
husband
or
your
wife
would
be
an
egregious
to
follow
your
judgments
you
do
know
beans
from
barley
corn
when
it
comes
to
the
actions
of
anybody
but
yourself
the
one
spirit
which
enlightens
as
to
actions
is
also
enlightening
your
other
half
as
to
actions
and
do
you
suppose
this
spirit
is
going
to
favor
with
better
judgment
about
your
other
half
duties
than
it
has
given
i
guess
do
be
presumptuous
my
boy
do
you
own
little
best
and
your
other
half
to
do
hers
trust
that
she
doing
the
best
and
above
all
trust
the
one
spirit
to
run
you
both
if
you
do
this
your
wife
will
in
your
esteem
and
the
higher
she
finds
herself
in
your
esteem
the
harder
she
will
try
to
please
you
and
rise
higher
and
girls
do
forget
that
the
shoe
fits
equally
well
the
other
foot
either
man
or
wife
can
bring
harmony
out
of
chaos
simply
by
the
other
half
all
his
or
her
a
marriage
without
even
a
pinhead
of
bitterness
is
a
marriage
without
a
of
mental
or
oral
chapter
ii
a
tale
of
woe
why
is
it
that
in
more
than
of
families
the
wife
and
mother
bears
not
only
the
children
but
the
burdens
and
heartaches
the
husband
supplies
the
generally
not
enough
the
wife
has
the
care
of
a
growing
and
increasing
family
the
best
of
everything
is
saved
for
and
he
is
waited
on
etc
if
the
children
annoy
him
he
goes
to
his
club
if
the
wife
dies
why
there
are
plenty
more
women
for
the
asking
thousands
of
women
are
simply
starving
for
love
and
men
are
either
willfully
blind
or
wholly
and
utterly
selfish
you
possibly
know
that
this
is
quite
true
another
thing
that
has
caused
me
many
a
time
to
question
everything
during
the
christmas
holidays
many
times
i
have
seen
hungry
shivering
little
ones
gazing
longingly
into
the
wonderful
show
windows
wanting
probably
just
one
toy
while
children
no
more
worthy
drive
by
in
carriages
having
more
than
they
want
love
home
mother
everything
on
the
other
hand
hunger
want
blues
many
times
and
both
god
children
let
us
hear
what
you
have
to
say
about
this
b
b
why
does
the
mother
in
of
the
families
bear
not
only
the
children
but
the
burdens
and
heartaches
she
is
too
thoughtless
and
inert
not
it
is
to
submit
to
bearing
children
than
it
is
to
rise
up
and
take
command
of
her
own
body
it
is
easier
to
carry
burdens
than
to
wake
up
and
them
it
is
easier
to
bear
things
and
grumble
than
it
is
to
kick
over
the
traces
and
them
to
be
sure
most
women
are
yet
under
the
hypnotic
spell
of
the
old
race
belief
that
it
is
woman
duty
to
submit
herself
to
any
kind
of
an
old
husband
but
that
is
just
what
i
said
women
find
it
easier
to
go
through
life
half
asleep
rather
than
to
for
themselves
paul
says
a
woman
is
to
think
she
is
to
ask
her
husband
to
think
for
her
at
least
that
is
what
the
translators
paul
says
privately
i
have
my
suspicions
that
those
manly
translators
helped
paul
to
say
a
bit
more
than
he
meant
to
it
is
to
let
her
husband
think
for
her
even
when
she
does
like
his
thoughts
so
she
uses
her
brain
in
instead
of
thinking
people
who
do
think
are
ruled
by
women
feel
they
feel
not
only
for
themselves
but
for
other
people
they
shoulder
the
burdens
of
the
whole
family
and
a
few
outside
the
family
they
do
it
themselves
because
it
is
to
feel
than
to
think
nobody
walks
up
to
a
woman
and
says
here
i
have
a
burden
that
very
heavy
carry
it
whilst
i
go
off
and
have
a
good
time
no
the
woman
simply
the
burden
and
hugs
it
and
feels
it
and
herself
on
doing
and
maybe
the
thing
hugs
as
a
burden
is
no
burden
at
all
to
the
other
people
in
the
family
my
dear
women
as
a
rule
are
chumps
they
rather
feel
than
to
the
right
thing
now
i
like
to
know
if
you
think
a
woman
who
has
made
herself
shouldered
and
wrinkled
and
over
burdens
burdens
real
or
fancied
is
such
a
creature
as
attracts
love
or
consideration
from
of
course
she
is
not
it
is
no
wonder
she
receives
no
love
or
consideration
from
her
husband
or
anybody
else
she
has
made
a
pack
mule
out
of
herself
for
the
carrying
of
utterly
useless
burdens
that
nobody
carried
and
the
carrying
of
which
benefits
nobody
and
now
that
she
has
grown
ugly
and
sour
at
the
business
she
need
not
feel
surprised
at
being
slighted
and
she
need
not
blame
folks
for
slighting
her
assumed
the
burdens
carried
them
wore
herself
out
at
it
it
is
all
her
own
fault
it
was
for
her
to
feel
and
grumble
than
to
wake
up
and
think
and
change
things
nobody
who
will
carry
a
single
burden
for
even
a
single
day
he
knows
that
fretting
and
worrying
and
grumbling
only
the
and
accomplish
nothing
woman
has
for
bearing
children
and
burdens
when
she
gets
tired
of
her
bargain
she
will
her
way
out
of
the
whole
in
the
meantime
the
harder
the
burdens
grow
the
more
quickly
she
will
revolt
and
make
of
herself
something
besides
a
burden
bearer
it
is
all
nonsense
to
talk
about
the
men
being
willfully
blind
or
wholly
and
utterly
selfish
no
man
a
shouldered
wrinkled
and
wife
no
man
respects
or
loves
a
woman
who
will
submit
to
bearing
unlimited
burdens
or
babies
either
and
if
a
woman
submits
and
yet
keeps
up
a
continual
grumbling
and
nagging
about
it
a
man
simply
despises
her
what
every
man
for
when
he
marries
a
woman
is
that
she
will
be
a
bright
trim
if
she
is
even
that
she
will
get
all
the
love
and
consideration
she
can
long
for
but
in
quarters
of
the
cases
of
marriage
the
woman
degenerates
into
a
whining
bundle
of
feelings
done
up
in
a
slattern
dress
and
smelling
like
a
her
husband
in
despair
gives
up
trying
to
understand
her
or
to
love
her
either
the
woman
in
such
a
case
is
apt
to
suffer
most
why
not
makes
it
the
business
of
her
life
to
suffer
she
herself
on
how
much
she
has
had
to
suffer
and
bear
she
cultivates
her
feelings
to
the
limit
a
man
thinks
it
unmanly
to
to
feelings
so
he
uses
all
his
wits
to
keep
from
doing
so
and
to
enable
him
to
hide
his
own
disappointment
and
make
the
best
of
life
as
he
finds
it
a
man
uses
his
best
when
he
meets
disappointment
a
woman
trots
out
her
feelings
and
her
best
and
calls
in
the
neighbors
so
the
woman
gets
the
lion
share
of
sympathy
which
means
that
all
the
other
women
get
out
best
handkerchiefs
and
try
to
imagine
just
how
would
feel
if
in
her
place
of
course
there
exceptions
i
heard
of
men
who
wept
and
retailed
their
woes
and
i
have
heard
of
women
with
gumption
the
woman
who
wrote
the
letter
at
the
head
of
this
chapter
is
a
not
a
thinker
she
looks
at
the
forlorn
bedraggled
specimens
of
her
own
sex
and
with
them
never
thinking
that
the
women
themselves
have
anything
to
do
with
making
their
conditions
she
feels
with
the
woman
because
is
a
woman
being
an
unthinking
creature
she
can
not
feel
for
the
man
at
all
woman
is
the
weaker
creature
for
no
other
reason
than
that
she
lives
in
her
feelings
man
is
the
stronger
for
no
other
reason
than
that
he
uses
his
wits
and
his
will
to
his
feelings
b
b
has
seen
children
gazing
into
shop
windows
immediately
she
imagines
how
would
feel
if
in
their
places
she
does
not
stop
to
think
that
in
all
probability
the
simple
act
of
gazing
into
the
window
may
bring
more
real
joy
to
those
children
than
the
of
the
whole
windowful
of
toys
would
bring
to
some
rich
man
child
she
does
not
that
life
consists
not
in
possessions
or
environment
but
in
the
to
possessions
or
environment
if
she
were
an
edwin
abbey
or
a
michael
angelo
she
would
gaze
on
our
walls
and
work
herself
up
into
a
great
state
of
feeling
because
we
had
to
have
such
miserable
daubs
instead
of
real
works
of
art
if
she
saw
us
gazing
on
an
abbey
or
angelo
picture
she
would
weep
tears
to
think
we
could
have
such
pictures
instead
of
those
hideous
bright
chromos
on
our
walls
it
would
never
occur
to
her
that
we
might
be
privately
comparing
her
abbeys
and
angelos
with
our
chromos
wondering
how
anybody
could
possibly
see
beauty
in
the
abbeys
and
about
of
women
sympathy
is
just
about
as
foolish
and
misplaced
as
that
if
b
b
would
go
up
and
get
acquainted
with
some
of
those
small
youngsters
she
sees
gazing
into
the
shop
windows
she
would
find
some
of
her
illusions
dispelled
she
would
find
among
them
less
longing
than
she
thinks
and
more
wonder
and
criticism
and
pure
curiosity
such
as
she
would
find
in
her
own
heart
if
she
were
gazing
at
a
curio
collection
i
remember
a
large
family
of
very
small
boys
that
i
used
to
feel
for
very
deeply
poor
little
pinched
ragged
looking
fellows
they
were
and
always
working
before
and
after
school
hours
i
gave
them
nickels
and
dimes
and
my
children
outgrown
clothes
and
new
fleece
lined
gloves
for
their
blue
little
hands
they
kept
the
clothes
hung
up
at
home
and
the
gloves
stuffed
in
their
pants
pockets
and
one
day
i
discovered
that
every
one
of
those
small
youngsters
had
a
something
i
had
never
had
in
my
life
they
lived
as
they
to
live
and
i
had
been
harrowing
my
feelings
and
carrying
their
burdens
for
nothing
this
world
is
a
pitiful
place
it
is
a
lovely
great
world
full
of
all
sorts
of
people
every
one
of
whom
fits
his
conditions
and
the
loveliest
thing
of
all
about
this
bright
blessed
old
world
is
that
there
is
not
a
man
woman
or
child
in
it
who
can
not
his
environment
if
he
does
like
the
one
he
now
occupies
he
can
think
his
way
into
anything
a
real
deep
tender
feeling
will
prompt
one
to
do
all
he
can
to
alleviate
distress
or
add
to
the
world
joy
feeling
prompts
to
action
but
this
sentimental
slush
which
slops
over
on
anything
and
everything
in
general
is
nothing
but
an
imitation
of
the
real
thing
to
sympathize
to
the
extent
of
is
good
to
harrow
up
the
feelings
when
you
can
not
or
will
not
act
is
simply
weakness
feeling
is
subject
to
the
same
law
as
water
take
away
its
banks
and
it
spreads
all
over
creation
and
becomes
a
stagnant
slough
of
despond
confine
it
by
banks
of
and
and
it
grows
deep
and
tender
and
powerful
and
bears
blessings
on
its
bosom
the
professional
is
adding
to
the
sum
total
of
the
misery
the
world
is
like
sweet
alice
ben
bolt
it
laughs
with
delight
when
you
give
it
a
smile
and
gets
out
its
pocket
handkerchief
to
weep
with
you
when
you
call
it
poor
thing
then
it
cuts
its
call
short
and
runs
around
the
corner
to
tell
your
neighbor
what
a
tiresome
old
thing
you
are
anyway
never
you
mind
the
tribulations
you
ca
help
dearie
just
wake
up
and
the
brightest
happiest
sweetest
thing
you
know
how
to
be
and
the
world
that
much
better
off
chapter
iii
to
be
loved
i
desire
to
attract
love
from
the
infinite
or
somewhere
that
i
may
not
be
starved
for
it
as
i
have
been
ever
since
i
married
my
husband
sneers
at
the
new
thought
and
in
fact
at
nearly
all
that
is
best
in
me
caroline
and
yet
this
woman
has
children
to
love
her
she
thinks
she
is
in
need
of
being
loved
but
what
she
really
needs
is
being
loved
is
the
of
loving
a
loving
man
or
woman
can
never
want
for
love
others
turn
to
them
in
love
as
naturally
as
flowers
turn
to
the
sun
in
order
to
be
loved
you
must
love
instead
of
trying
to
attract
the
love
of
others
seek
to
your
love
to
others
nothing
in
after
a
time
you
will
find
the
unexpected
coming
to
you
spontaneously
learn
to
love
by
loving
people
and
and
especially
all
things
you
find
to
do
this
same
caroline
wants
to
rise
above
drudgery
what
drudgery
is
simply
unloved
nothing
more
nor
less
work
which
is
looked
down
upon
and
which
is
done
with
the
hands
the
heart
and
mind
are
criticizing
and
running
out
after
other
things
work
thus
done
is
drudgery
work
done
with
the
hands
a
small
and
unwilling
of
the
mind
is
drudgery
to
her
who
and
and
does
with
a
will
what
she
finds
to
do
there
is
no
drudgery
let
the
woman
who
longs
to
be
loved
begin
to
by
practicing
on
her
work
to
quit
calling
it
drudgery
to
put
her
mind
and
will
and
into
piece
of
work
as
it
comes
is
the
first
and
longest
step
toward
loving
it
it
is
an
easily
demonstrated
fact
that
we
learn
to
love
anything
we
persist
in
doing
with
a
will
to
love
our
work
enlarges
our
capacity
for
loving
people
and
the
more
we
love
people
the
more
people
we
the
more
radiant
we
become
it
is
the
radiant
lover
whom
all
the
world
loves
do
you
know
that
love
and
the
lack
of
love
are
governed
by
it
is
to
love
as
every
child
does
but
as
we
grow
up
we
keep
saying
to
ourselves
this
is
you
know
that
we
do
like
this
and
we
do
like
that
until
really
we
our
love
and
live
in
a
continual
state
of
do
like
a
state
which
in
due
time
develops
into
hate
for
self
as
well
as
others
do
like
does
it
all
now
love
by
keep
saying
i
this
and
i
like
that
for
things
to
like
and
even
tell
yourself
you
like
things
when
you
do
that
you
like
them
at
all
feeling
is
a
of
suggestion
nothing
easier
to
prove
than
that
a
hypnotist
can
by
suggestion
make
you
feel
almost
anything
whether
it
is
true
or
not
he
will
say
you
feel
sad
and
straightway
you
will
feel
so
then
he
will
say
you
feel
happy
and
you
do
your
feelings
are
like
a
harp
and
your
or
are
the
fingers
which
pick
the
strings
take
good
care
to
play
the
tunes
you
to
say
you
things
or
love
them
then
you
will
quickly
respond
and
that
you
like
or
love
them
keep
until
you
love
the
time
then
you
will
loved
to
your
heart
content
chapter
iv
the
pharisee
as
long
as
you
continue
to
hug
the
delusion
that
you
are
not
to
blame
for
the
unpleasant
things
in
your
conditions
you
might
just
as
well
profess
the
old
thought
as
the
new
the
very
fundamental
principle
of
mental
science
is
the
statement
that
is
a
magnet
and
able
to
attract
what
he
to
repudiate
this
statement
is
to
knock
the
props
out
from
under
the
whole
philosophy
better
stay
an
and
let
jesus
suffer
for
your
sins
and
those
of
your
relatives
and
friends
at
least
jesus
the
sins
of
the
world
to
bear
all
of
his
own
free
will
there
is
some
comfort
in
letting
jesus
do
what
he
chose
to
do
but
you
have
turned
away
from
jesus
as
a
scapegoat
you
refuse
to
lay
your
burdens
on
him
who
offered
to
bear
them
and
you
refuse
to
bear
them
yourself
instead
you
distribute
them
around
among
your
relations
and
friends
and
then
fret
your
soul
because
they
wo
accept
your
distributions
of
course
you
excuse
yourself
by
acknowledging
your
share
of
responsibility
for
the
unpleasantness
of
conditions
but
if
you
will
examine
carefully
you
will
find
that
your
portion
of
the
responsibility
includes
most
of
the
things
in
your
conditions
whilst
you
have
portioned
off
almost
the
responsibility
for
the
things
among
your
protesting
or
indifferent
relatives
you
always
say
try
so
hard
but
you
never
balance
that
with
tries
so
hard
try
so
hard
you
get
all
the
in
your
own
pile
and
the
in
other
folk
piles
it
were
not
for
tom
and
dick
and
harry
and
fan
you
would
do
wonders
they
only
treat
you
with
the
consideration
other
people
give
you
or
half
give
other
people
if
i
wonder
why
they
do
indeed
it
is
just
because
you
are
you
you
attract
your
own
particular
kind
of
to
all
intents
and
purposes
tom
dick
harry
and
fan
are
a
punch
and
judy
show
and
pull
the
when
other
people
pull
the
strings
there
a
different
sort
of
show
you
are
the
motive
power
in
their
treatment
of
not
a
tone
or
look
or
act
of
theirs
in
your
direction
but
are
responsible
for
it
was
and
no
other
who
drew
them
to
you
and
it
is
you
and
no
other
who
hold
them
there
now
do
say
i
do
see
of
course
not
have
wanted
to
see
you
been
too
intent
justifying
yourself
and
anyway
it
takes
an
open
mind
and
some
time
and
much
to
enable
us
to
see
the
of
things
we
have
to
as
if
they
were
so
a
long
time
before
we
see
that
they
are
if
you
had
upon
the
principle
that
you
are
a
magnet
and
that
that
comes
to
you
comes
by
your
attraction
you
have
long
ago
had
your
eyes
opened
to
see
how
and
you
have
made
progress
and
your
you
are
ever
going
to
be
a
magnet
you
are
one
if
you
are
ever
going
to
be
able
to
attract
to
the
hair
breadth
whatsoever
you
will
you
are
doing
it
there
will
be
no
miraculous
change
in
the
running
gear
of
this
universe
to
enable
you
to
attract
what
you
want
you
now
are
in
essence
and
working
principle
you
have
always
been
and
you
will
always
be
the
same
yesterday
today
and
forever
a
magnet
to
the
hair
only
by
changing
the
quality
of
your
magnetism
can
you
change
your
environment
and
attract
different
treatment
from
tom
dick
harry
and
fan
sweetness
within
brings
sweetness
without
you
have
been
more
or
less
bitter
and
within
and
tom
dick
harry
and
fan
have
danced
to
the
strings
you
pulled
as
long
as
you
think
try
and
they
do
as
long
as
you
think
judgment
superior
to
theirs
ideals
loftier
and
worthier
ways
better
you
will
get
from
them
responses
of
carelessness
bitterness
lack
of
consideration
selfishness
are
inconsiderate
of
ideas
ideals
judgments
and
ways
they
are
inconsiderate
of
yours
if
you
had
your
way
they
be
pretty
little
putty
images
of
ideals
judgments
wishes
ways
and
feelings
the
law
of
individuality
prevents
your
imposing
yourself
on
them
you
think
you
are
finding
fault
with
lack
of
consideration
are
really
condemning
the
law
of
if
you
are
ever
to
be
a
magnet
you
are
one
now
that
comes
your
fault
if
anything
different
comes
it
will
come
through
change
of
mental
attitude
and
action
it
will
not
do
to
throw
it
on
karma
either
and
say
you
are
receiving
now
the
unpleasant
things
deserved
in
a
previous
state
of
existence
the
mills
of
the
gods
grind
slowly
but
they
are
not
so
dead
slow
as
all
that
what
you
thought
and
did
in
a
previous
state
has
determined
your
parentage
and
childhood
environment
in
this
but
the
pangs
you
suffer
today
have
their
roots
in
yesterday
or
day
before
or
the
year
before
that
cause
and
effect
trip
close
upon
each
other
heels
so
close
that
the
careless
or
ignorant
observer
misses
the
trip
he
exaggerates
the
if
it
be
an
unhappy
one
and
goes
nosing
for
a
bigger
cause
than
the
real
one
how
could
little
slip
of
this
morning
or
yesterday
be
the
cause
of
this
evil
which
has
befallen
him
and
he
slides
completely
over
the
real
cause
keeps
on
repeating
by
blinding
your
eyes
to
the
truth
is
the
direct
cause
of
the
most
gigantic
and
the
most
subtle
miseries
of
the
world
these
awfully
good
people
who
fully
realize
how
hard
they
have
always
tried
to
do
right
are
the
unhappiest
people
in
the
world
unless
i
except
tom
dick
harry
and
fan
the
victims
of
these
reformers
no
i
ca
even
except
these
for
they
at
least
generally
succeed
in
having
their
own
way
in
spite
of
the
reformer
but
what
so
utterly
disheartening
as
continued
of
and
the
one
never
succeeds
it
is
hard
to
be
so
wise
and
willing
with
such
ideals
the
one
strong
on
ideals
and
to
succeed
in
making
tom
dick
and
harry
conform
to
them
do
you
see
why
jesus
said
so
often
woe
comes
to
the
pharisee
the
and
why
he
called
them
hypocrites
of
course
they
are
unconscious
of
their
hypocrisy
blinds
them
to
the
truth
they
think
are
to
blame
for
most
of
the
one
own
hard
conditions
the
one
is
doomed
to
a
of
petty
failures
he
goes
round
and
round
his
own
little
personal
point
of
view
and
learns
nothing
it
is
by
getting
at
the
point
of
view
that
we
learn
things
about
him
and
ourselves
too
when
the
one
wakes
up
to
the
that
the
world
is
of
people
whose
points
of
view
are
as
right
and
wise
and
ideal
as
his
own
and
begins
to
and
pull
with
these
other
people
instead
of
against
them
when
he
does
this
he
will
find
himself
out
of
the
treadmill
to
as
he
shows
a
disposition
to
consider
people
ideals
and
help
others
in
the
line
want
to
go
he
will
find
the
whole
world
eager
to
help
in
the
way
wants
to
go
the
one
works
alone
and
meets
defeat
the
one
who
recognizing
his
own
righteousness
yet
forgets
not
that
are
even
as
he
is
the
true
friend
and
of
all
the
world
now
do
let
this
homily
slip
off
shoulders
we
are
in
spots
and
none
of
us
is
so
wise
that
he
can
not
by
and
readjustment
learn
a
lot
more
each
soul
its
is
wisest
and
best
do
try
to
get
into
the
pilot
house
and
steer
things
for
tom
dick
or
harry
stay
in
your
own
and
steer
clear
of
the
rocks
of
anger
malice
revenge
interference
and
chapter
so
near
and
yet
so
far
help
me
to
make
things
go
forward
instead
of
backward
i
want
to
be
neat
and
attractive
with
a
good
head
of
hair
a
good
complexion
and
good
health
i
want
to
help
my
husband
so
he
will
fall
in
love
with
me
to
make
home
beautiful
attractive
and
comfortable
i
want
bright
eyes
and
freedom
from
that
careworn
look
oh
i
want
to
draw
my
husband
nearer
to
me
from
a
taurus
woman
aged
is
that
pitiful
and
heaven
knows
or
ought
to
how
many
poor
women
men
live
with
that
same
dumb
longing
to
get
nearer
and
be
chums
with
somebody
that
cry
touches
my
heart
for
i
lived
years
in
the
same
state
and
oh
how
i
struggled
to
draw
others
nearer
to
me
how
i
agonized
and
cried
and
prayed
over
it
how
i
worked
to
make
home
attractive
how
i
cooked
and
washed
and
scrubbed
sewed
and
patched
and
darned
to
please
how
i
quickly
brushed
my
hair
and
hustled
into
a
clean
dress
so
as
to
be
neat
and
ready
when
my
husband
came
in
and
how
i
ached
and
despaired
inwardly
because
he
frowned
and
found
fault
how
i
studied
books
of
advice
to
young
wives
how
their
advice
failed
how
i
and
tried
to
get
him
to
confide
in
me
and
make
a
chum
of
me
and
how
the
more
i
tried
the
more
he
had
business
downtown
oh
the
growing
despair
of
it
all
and
the
growing
illnesses
too
oh
the
gulf
that
widened
and
widened
between
us
oh
the
oh
the
of
life
i
to
give
it
up
i
was
enough
of
a
to
sink
into
a
state
of
perpetual
whining
protest
or
to
commit
suicide
when
i
was
finally
that
i
draw
him
nearer
i
gave
it
up
and
began
to
take
notice
again
other
i
him
live
his
life
and
i
took
up
the
burden
of
my
own
lonely
existence
and
the
first
thing
i
knew
my
burden
had
grown
and
i
was
longer
i
began
to
live
my
life
to
instead
of
living
it
for
the
purpose
of
the
life
of
another
the
thing
i
knew
my
husband
did
have
so
much
business
downtown
and
he
had
more
things
he
wanted
to
tell
me
i
found
we
were
nearer
than
i
ever
dreamed
we
be
you
see
i
had
become
comfortable
to
live
i
had
quit
to
draw
him
nearer
and
behold
was
already
in
the
old
days
i
lived
strenuously
i
hustled
so
to
get
the
house
and
the
children
and
myself
that
i
got
into
a
regular
snarl
my
husband
being
a
healthy
animal
felt
the
snarl
before
he
saw
the
immaculateness
and
like
any
healthy
animal
he
snarled
back
and
had
business
downtown
he
responded
to
my
mental
and
emotional
state
responded
against
his
will
many
times
and
i
did
not
know
it
i
supposed
him
perverse
and
impossible
of
pleasing
i
had
tried
my
best
according
to
my
lights
which
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
to
doubt
but
it
never
entered
my
cranium
that
had
tried
too
i
looked
upon
the
outward
appearance
my
immaculate
appearance
met
by
or
indifference
i
poor
me
perverse
he
poor
martha
troubled
about
many
things
when
only
one
thing
is
needful
a
quiet
mind
and
faithful
soul
history
does
not
state
if
martha
had
a
husband
if
she
did
he
was
perpetually
downtown
and
jesus
preferred
mary
the
comfortable
one
to
martha
poor
lonesome
martha
and
she
tried
to
please
i
used
to
know
a
woman
who
never
did
a
thing
but
look
sweet
she
was
pretty
and
sympathetic
and
her
husband
and
six
children
idolized
her
and
fairly
fell
over
themselves
to
please
her
and
keep
the
home
beautiful
for
her
there
was
physical
energy
galore
lavished
by
the
family
in
doing
what
is
commonly
considered
the
mother
work
and
there
was
apparently
nothing
whatever
the
matter
with
that
woman
who
was
always
sweet
and
pretty
as
a
new
blown
rose
and
looked
not
a
day
over
twenty
she
was
simply
born
tired
and
would
work
of
course
the
neighbors
said
things
about
her
but
nobody
say
things
such
a
sweet
tempered
cordial
and
pretty
woman
and
there
have
been
razors
flying
through
the
air
if
anybody
had
dared
hint
to
that
husband
or
one
of
those
children
that
mother
was
anything
less
than
perfection
the
family
explanation
was
that
mother
is
not
strong
but
that
mother
did
more
for
that
family
than
all
the
others
put
together
made
the
and
she
was
the
sun
around
which
husband
and
children
revolved
and
from
which
they
received
the
real
light
of
life
the
power
which
develops
the
good
in
us
the
mother
main
business
in
life
was
that
of
she
was
the
confidante
the
counsellor
the
optimistic
teacher
and
the
appreciative
audience
for
six
children
and
a
husband
besides
a
lot
of
neighbors
who
carried
their
troubles
to
her
she
performed
more
mental
work
than
it
takes
to
manage
a
billion
dollar
trust
she
kept
six
children
not
only
out
of
mischief
but
at
all
sorts
of
household
and
outdoor
work
which
it
was
well
for
them
to
know
they
learned
to
keep
house
and
farm
by
keeping
them
whilst
she
sat
by
and
enthused
and
directed
their
efforts
she
made
them
it
all
she
helped
them
over
the
hard
places
in
their
school
work
and
enthused
them
to
do
better
work
they
carried
off
the
school
prizes
under
her
admiring
eyes
and
ran
straight
to
lay
them
in
her
lap
and
receive
that
proud
and
happy
smile
of
hers
her
husband
worked
like
a
slave
the
heart
of
a
she
thought
him
the
best
bravest
brightest
of
men
and
told
him
so
a
dozen
times
a
day
besides
it
every
time
he
came
in
range
of
her
big
loving
brown
eyes
and
smooth
rosy
cheeks
i
never
heard
of
an
unkind
word
in
that
family
and
those
six
children
grew
up
into
splendid
young
manhood
and
womanhood
their
mother
is
still
the
blessed
sun
of
their
existence
she
is
prettier
healthier
and
happier
now
and
so
proud
of
her
fine
children
and
she
is
she
has
studied
and
read
with
her
whole
family
and
is
interested
with
them
in
the
world
present
events
art
literature
and
religion
do
you
think
that
woman
ever
complains
of
loneliness
or
tries
so
hard
to
draw
husband
or
children
nearer
no
she
long
ago
chose
the
one
thing
needful
her
physical
strength
would
not
bear
much
strain
without
depressing
her
therefore
she
left
the
physical
labor
out
less
to
her
the
was
more
than
meat
or
raiment
so
she
ministered
to
the
life
to
the
joy
of
living
a
stronger
woman
physically
could
have
ministered
more
efficiently
to
the
physical
side
without
neglecting
the
one
thing
needful
this
woman
chose
the
better
part
and
stuck
to
it
and
prove
her
righteousness
the
foolish
woman
looketh
upon
the
outward
appearance
and
is
troubled
over
things
she
wears
herself
out
trying
to
keep
the
immaculate
and
grieves
her
heart
out
because
she
misses
the
one
thing
of
great
price
the
of
loving
and
being
loved
of
trusting
and
being
do
you
know
that
we
are
far
away
from
we
are
close
to
our
husbands
our
children
our
friends
to
our
enemies
if
we
have
them
and
to
those
we
never
saw
or
heard
of
are
all
one
soul
is
my
soul
too
only
our
bodies
are
at
all
separated
and
they
are
separated
as
the
harbor
is
separated
from
the
our
bodies
are
but
inlets
of
one
great
soul
and
they
are
but
the
smallest
part
of
ourselves
is
it
then
not
foolish
to
to
draw
another
nearer
why
we
are
so
near
we
be
nearer
we
are
why
strive
to
do
what
is
done
ah
you
see
we
work
from
a
false
hypothesis
we
are
so
concerned
with
the
many
things
on
the
that
we
lose
sight
of
your
husband
nearness
for
be
not
troubled
over
the
many
things
of
appearance
faith
in
if
there
is
any
drawing
nearer
to
be
done
see
that
draw
near
to
him
faith
and
instead
of
mentally
or
verbally
sitting
down
on
his
motives
words
or
acts
to
feel
as
he
does
that
you
may
understand
as
we
geow
in
understanding
of
another
we
grow
in
love
and
realization
of
our
nearness
to
that
one
proportion
as
we
dislike
or
are
repelled
by
any
or
his
actions
that
proportion
we
fail
to
understand
as
one
human
being
is
revealed
to
another
the
sense
of
nearness
grows
now
do
you
imagine
that
distrust
and
censure
will
help
a
soul
reveal
itself
of
course
not
but
if
you
can
be
comfortable
and
indulgent
to
a
man
and
especially
if
you
can
cultivate
a
real
admiring
confidence
in
him
he
will
unfold
his
very
heart
of
hearts
to
you
it
is
who
must
come
near
in
faith
and
love
if
you
would
find
your
husband
near
to
you
to
sum
up
you
and
your
husband
are
close
together
so
close
you
are
if
you
would
the
truth
of
this
you
must
come
to
your
husband
in
love
and
you
not
allow
to
condemn
or
judge
verbally
or
mentally
his
revelations
of
himself
you
must
vibrate
him
where
you
can
and
still
in
where
you
ca
understand
him
and
meet
him
you
must
persist
in
thus
doing
until
faith
and
love
and
understanding
become
the
habit
of
your
life
the
same
rules
apply
if
you
would
feel
your
nearness
to
any
other
person
to
all
every
man
is
in
embryo
a
good
and
thoughtful
and
loving
husband
a
wise
wife
will
give
him
the
loving
appreciative
atmosphere
which
encourages
development
we
are
all
just
as
good
as
we
know
how
to
be
and
as
bad
as
we
dare
be
we
are
all
growing
why
not
chant
the
beauties
of
the
good
instead
of
imagining
it
our
duty
to
eternally
bark
against
the
bad
it
is
said
there
can
not
be
a
model
husband
without
a
model
wife
and
true
then
if
yours
is
not
a
model
husband
assume
that
you
are
a
model
wife
fitted
to
judge
and
admonish
be
still
and
get
acquainted
with
him
make
it
your
object
in
life
to
cultivate
a
serene
and
heart
and
aura
as
a
means
toward
this
end
cultivate
a
appreciation
of
whatever
and
whoever
comes
near
you
cultivate
the
spirit
of
praise
and
where
you
can
not
see
second
take
care
of
your
body
and
personal
appearance
allow
plenty
of
time
for
bathing
caring
for
your
hair
nails
teeth
and
clothing
wear
plain
clothes
if
need
be
but
do
wear
soiled
or
ragged
ones
and
do
ever
put
a
pin
where
a
hook
or
button
ought
to
be
no
man
can
continue
to
love
a
woman
who
is
slatternly
third
allow
at
least
an
hour
day
for
reading
and
meditating
on
new
thought
lines
for
going
into
the
silence
let
nothing
rob
you
of
this
hour
for
of
it
will
come
wisdom
love
and
power
to
meet
the
work
and
trials
of
all
other
hours
remember
the
parable
of
the
ten
virgins
and
take
this
hour
for
filling
your
lamp
that
you
be
ready
for
the
unexpected
only
in
such
hours
can
you
lay
up
love
wisdom
and
power
which
will
enable
you
to
make
the
best
of
the
other
hours
let
not
outward
things
rob
you
of
your
source
of
fourth
unless
you
wish
to
fall
behind
the
world
procession
see
that
you
spend
some
time
every
day
in
reading
the
best
magazines
and
newspapers
taking
pains
to
skip
most
of
the
criminal
news
read
optimistically
and
cultivate
a
quick
eye
for
all
the
good
things
take
the
magazines
even
if
you
have
to
leave
feathers
off
your
hat
and
desserts
off
your
table
if
you
can
find
an
literary
club
it
might
be
well
to
join
it
and
do
your
part
of
the
work
but
see
that
you
do
not
the
peter
of
your
energies
to
pay
the
paul
of
club
ambitions
and
fifthly
comes
your
housework
this
is
the
juggernaut
department
which
grinds
many
a
woman
to
skin
and
bones
and
her
husband
discards
the
remains
when
it
comes
to
housekeeping
a
woman
has
need
of
all
the
love
wisdom
and
power
she
can
muster
in
her
hours
of
silence
even
a
five
room
flat
or
cottage
is
more
than
one
woman
can
keep
and
allow
time
for
anything
else
many
things
be
left
undone
the
wise
woman
simplifies
to
the
last
degree
compatible
with
comfort
useless
is
dispensed
with
not
how
much
but
is
her
rule
when
buying
a
few
good
things
in
are
better
than
a
clutter
of
flimsy
things
which
pander
only
to
an
uncultured
esthetic
taste
and
make
work
is
the
wise
woman
first
law
in
housekeeping
cleanliness
her
second
which
is
like
unto
the
first
in
importance
she
lets
extra
rooms
furniture
and
fallals
go
she
can
pay
well
to
have
them
cared
the
same
rule
obtains
in
her
kitchen
and
her
personal
dress
the
wise
woman
thinks
of
comfort
and
allows
time
for
the
of
life
wherefore
her
life
is
a
pleasure
the
foolish
woman
is
ground
under
the
wheels
of
routine
to
her
housework
is
a
stern
duty
which
comes
and
to
which
body
mind
personal
appearance
happiness
the
joy
of
living
all
must
be
sacrificed
lastly
firstly
and
all
the
time
the
wise
woman
is
guided
in
what
to
do
and
in
what
to
leave
undone
by
the
spirit
of
love
whilst
the
foolish
woman
is
guided
by
the
spirit
of
appearances
note
the
order
in
which
i
have
written
these
needs
of
life
an
exact
reversal
of
the
usual
order
housework
and
the
spirit
of
comfort
first
the
tendency
of
every
woman
is
to
lose
in
troubling
over
the
many
things
of
her
household
if
she
would
be
happy
useful
young
and
growing
she
must
turn
her
life
the
other
side
up
the
best
way
to
begin
the
only
successful
way
so
far
as
i
know
is
by
making
time
for
the
hour
of
reading
and
meditation
and
silence
she
must
the
time
by
sheer
force
of

chapter
vi
marriage
contracts
that
article
of
yours
near
and
yet
so
far
has
worried
me
to
an
extent
i
am
ashamed
of
to
my
that
article
is
disingenuous
it
is
not
so
much
that
you
jumped
on
that
poor
soul
with
shoes
but
that
you
formulated
the
quite
as
the
husband
might
have
done
that
is
if
would
repent
and
change
her
course
she
would
soon
find
that
was
all
right
and
inferentially
all
the
trouble
was
of
her
making
not
one
word
on
the
other
side
you
even
quote
your
own
experience
her
my
dear
you
really
find
that
your
was
of
your
own
making
and
you
really
change
anything
except
your
own
amount
of
distress
during
the
process
of
disintegration
marriage
is
the
only
contract
which
society
does
not
promptly
admit
to
be
broken
when
either
party
refuses
to
fulfill
his
obligations
as
agreed
to
and
in
view
of
the
custom
of
ages
and
the
instinct
in
woman
formed
by
such
custom
when
instinct
makes
the
establishing
of
individuality
the
hardest
thing
in
life
for
a
generous
woman
i
think
that
your
implication
against
the
woman
trying
with
all
the
light
she
to
keep
her
side
of
that
very
contract
is
simply
cruel
i
wish
i
could
get
at
that
girl
and
tell
her
that
her
chance
for
happiness
is
through
the
paradox
not
lose
his
life
find
it
whoso
will
not
go
of
the
love
which
his
five
per
cent
judgment
claims
as
his
only
chance
can
not
inherit
that
which
the
per
cent
would
attract
if
the
five
per
cent
were
up
to
the
spirit
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
ever
disagreed
with
your
point
of
view
jane
that
article
so
near
and
yet
so
far
has
brought
forth
volumes
of
comment
most
of
it
highly
favorable
and
nearly
all
of
it
from
women
themselves
but
among
the
writers
were
three
critics
and
among
the
critics
one
of
the
brightest
women
i
know
whose
letter
appears
above
and
she
says
that
article
is
to
her
disingenuous
of
course
it
is
for
she
has
not
yet
arrived
at
the
point
of
up
her
own
she
is
still
a
pharisee
of
the
pharisees
on
the
surface
she
is
proud
she
she
has
done
her
best
to
bring
things
right
according
to
her
judgment
of
right
and
she
to
acknowledge
her
foolishness
she
will
hold
fast
her
own
integrity
as
long
as
there
is
a
shred
of
it
left
do
i
know
did
i
do
exactly
the
same
thing
of
course
but
the
pressure
of
the
great
spirit
of
love
wisdom
justice
was
too
much
for
me
i
to
give
up
my
judgment
i
to
acknowledge
that
there
be
the
same
spirit
expressing
in
my
husband
judgment
i
to
let
go
be
still
and
get
at
point
of
view
jane
too
will
have
to
do
it
and
the
fact
that
that
article
worried
her
to
an
extent
she
is
ashamed
of
is
the
proof
when
truth
presses
her
point
we
worry
until
we
can
hold
out
no
longer
then
we
give
in
one
of
the
other
two
critics
writes
that
over
that
article
she
shed
the
first
tears
in
over
seven
years
then
she
asks
me
if
i
do
think
i
was
a
little
hard
on
the
taurus
woman
and
goes
on
to
reveal
plainly
that
her
tears
were
those
of
do
i
know
have
i
shed
quarts
of
such
tears
of
course
but
not
more
than
an
ounce
or
two
were
shed
after
i
gave
up
my
own
way
but
this
second
critic
is
arriving
just
as
i
did
and
as
jane
will
arriving
all
unconsciously
to
herself
her
letter
sounds
like
a
chapter
from
my
own
thinking
of
a
dozen
years
ago
she
gives
a
bird
eye
view
of
her
husband
no
of
her
she
tells
how
she
reads
new
thought
literature
on
the
sly
just
as
i
did
and
she
winds
up
with
this
of
good
advice
i
will
say
to
such
live
your
own
life
as
god
intended
you
to
regardless
of
the
fact
of
your
husband
be
brave
hope
will
and
pray
dress
look
sweet
if
your
husband
tells
you
he
does
care
how
you
look
but
to
not
come
near
him
with
your
foolishness
as
mine
does
why
let
him
live
his
life
in
his
own
way
make
home
attractive
for
your
own
sake
read
good
books
and
in
time
books
will
be
your
chum
the
third
critic
too
is
full
of
though
she
does
not
mention
her
tears
and
her
letter
is
a
long
portrait
of
her
husband
faults
she
wants
a
little
encouragement
to
leave
him
but
she
is
afraid
he
will
go
to
the
dogs
if
she
does
so
like
a
generous
woman
she
sticks
to
him
and
makes
the
best
of
a
bad
bargain
jane
says
my
article
was
cruel
dearie
it
was
as
the
surgeon
knife
is
cruel
but
it
is
the
truth
and
it
hurts
but
to
make
way
for
healing
the
woman
who
blames
has
in
her
eye
something
worse
than
a
cataract
the
woman
who
sheds
tears
over
her
fate
is
moved
by
the
meanest
of
emotions
she
attracts
cruelty
not
only
from
that
article
from
her
it
takes
to
quarrel
either
one
can
stop
it
takes
to
maintain
strained
relations
and
one
can
ease
the
the
principles
i
tried
to
elucidate
in
that
article
are
as
applicable
to
a
man
as
to
a
woman
but
it
was
a
woman
a
taurus
woman
who
asked
me
therefore
i
talked
straight
to
her
and
am
a
taurus
woman
who
has
been
through
the
same
mill
and
i
wrote
not
from
a
hardened
heart
but
from
one
made
tender
by
experience
and
the
spirit
of
truth
my
point
of
view
might
have
been
the
husband
the
husband
had
been
an
unusually
just
one
and
i
must
say
the
husband
point
of
view
is
more
apt
to
be
than
the
wife
for
the
reason
that
a
woman
is
more
apt
to
be
blinded
by
in
proportion
as
man
or
woman
is
ruled
by
emotion
his
judgment
is
distorted
a
rule
is
straighter
than
a
woman
but
judgment
is
a
shallow
thing
based
upon
revealed
woman
intuition
goes
to
the
heart
of
things
and
flashes
facts
into
revelation
women
as
a
rule
but
are
apt
to
misjudge
what
is
at
only
as
man
wakes
in
woman
and
woman
in
man
do
right
judgment
and
love
commune
why
not
judge
with
the
husband
as
i
with
the
wife
is
any
man
depraved
jane
feels
abused
because
she
thinks
think
that
in
family
strains
the
woman
is
more
at
fault
a
i
do
can
not
only
make
and
unmake
empires
but
they
do
make
or
fail
to
make
why
men
with
all
their
power
are
mere
rag
babies
in
the
hands
of
women
of
women
are
the
power
in
the
world
the
power
behind
the
throne
if
only
they
would
develop
that
particular
kind
of
power
instead
of
coming
around
in
front
of
the
throne
to
lay
down
the
law
instead
of
measuring
their
against
man
real
will
move
the
most
stubborn
of
men
if
i
blame
the
woman
i
blame
neither
any
more
than
i
blame
a
child
for
childishness
it
is
because
know
she
is
the
ruling
her
responsibility
is
determined
by
her
real
power
and
above
all
a
taurus
woman
may
rule
her
home
either
she
rules
by
force
for
she
has
more
than
her
share
of
the
man
in
her
and
makes
war
and
trouble
for
herself
and
others
or
she
learns
her
lesson
and
rules
by
in
which
case
her
husband
rises
up
and
calls
her
the
who
knows
and
rules
is
the
woman
of
proverbs
xxxi
to
verses
her
husband
is
honored
among
men
he
is
honored
at
and
because
he
is
honored
he
up
to
why
girls
you
hold
your
husband
destiny
in
the
hollow
of
your
hand
in
a
far
greater
sense
than
any
man
holds
a
woman
but
as
i
said
before
takes
two
to
make
an
unhappy
home
and
either
one
can
bring
harmony
out
of
any
ordinary
woman
can
do
it
she
and
any
extraordinary
man
can
do
it
quite
as
well
as
an
ordinary
woman
this
is
not
a
question
of
what
society
admits
it
is
a
personal
question
between
one
man
and
one
woman
it
a
partnership
whether
society
so
admits
or
not
and
the
failure
of
one
of
the
partners
to
live
up
to
the
expressed
or
implied
agreement
does
not
justify
the
other
party
in
the
misdoing
of
her
part
long
as
they
live
does
one
theft
or
murder
justify
another
no
neither
does
a
neglectful
husband
justify
a
scolding
or
spiteful
wife
nor
two
people
marry
for
the
happiness
of
love
and
second
for
home
privileges
no
matter
whether
love
flees
or
not
long
as
they
keep
the
partnership
it
should
be
done
in
the
spirit
of
harmony
remember
it
takes
to
destroy
harmony
and
one
can
restore
if
marriage
is
not
a
love
contract
let
it
at
least
be
a
harmonious
business
contract
if
you
ca
or
wo
to
your
husband
then
leave
him
do
stay
and
your
part
of
the
business
and
cultivate
hate
and
contempt
it
hell
i
have
known
several
couples
who
lived
years
in
comparative
happiness
after
love
had
flown
who
were
kind
to
each
other
considerate
the
wives
made
pleasant
homes
and
the
husbands
came
and
went
at
will
in
their
spare
time
the
wives
developed
their
personal
interests
and
lived
their
own
lives
as
critic
number
two
advises
when
the
husbands
took
cranky
streaks
the
wives
simply
made
light
of
it
to
themselves
and
forgot
it
as
soon
as
possible
they
lived
on
as
comfortable
terms
as
if
the
wives
were
simply
hired
little
crankisms
were
all
in
the
bargain
eventually
every
one
of
these
couples
separated
and
nearly
all
the
parties
are
now
married
parted
each
being
to
terminate
the
old
partnership
to
me
a
divorce
is
not
a
disgrace
but
a
family
row
and
i
suspect
that
most
divorce
are
worked
up
to
guilty
neither
has
done
his
best
by
the
other
and
he
knows
it
so
he
raises
a
great
row
to
fix
attention
on
the
other
shortcomings
that
his
own
may
escape
observation
until
a
man
and
woman
have
succeeded
in
living
up
to
their
home
privileges
in
a
manner
befitting
honest
and
intelligent
man
and
woman
ca
be
sure
that
they
are
not
fitted
for
a
real
loving
friction
over
small
things
obscures
vision
and
judgment
and
hate
hides
the
lovableness
that
lie
in
every
being
get
rid
of
the
rowing
over
little
things
of
every
day
life
and
you
will
be
able
to
love
as
much
as
your
marriage
will
permit
you
will
be
free
to
dissolve
the
entire
partnership
if
you
did
i
change
anything
is
it
anything
to
bring
peace
and
quiet
pleasure
and
comfort
and
appreciation
where
their
opposites
were
wont
to
hold
bacchanale
no
woman
who
tries
the
course
i
have
endeavored
to
outline
will
ever
doubt
that
she
really
accomplishes
neither
will
she
regret
here
is
a
word
every
married
woman
will
do
well
to
heed
as
long
as
she
lives
with
her
husband
you
ca
have
your
way
without
a
fuss
then
try
his
with
a
good
peace
be
unto
you
peace
which
is
the
foundation
for
you
chapter
vii
some
hints
and
a
kick
and
now
elizabeth
let
me
suggest
something
punch
up
the
a
little
in
the
matter
of
cultivating
cleanly
habits
etc
women
are
preached
to
eternally
on
these
matters
and
the
men
wholly
neglected
it
would
be
a
thought
to
take
to
the
men
a
little
and
might
assist
in
making
more
of
them
fit
companions
for
the
sweet
and
cleanly
women
they
delight
in
associating
with
the
absolute
neglect
of
the
masculine
sex
by
writers
on
these
subjects
causes
them
to
think
that
nothing
in
the
way
of
the
aesthetic
is
expected
of
them
it
is
a
wrong
to
the
men
not
to
and
make
me
his
chum
as
well
as
his
wife
help
courage
them
to
aspire
to
a
common
plane
with
woman
in
the
matters
of
purity
and
cleanliness
cleanliness
is
next
to
godliness
but
no
more
so
in
the
case
of
woman
than
of
man
it
is
time
for
equality
to
be
recognized
in
this
matter
as
in
all
others
carrie
it
is
funny
how
many
women
squirm
when
reminded
that
it
is
they
who
set
the
pace
in
the
home
we
are
always
longing
for
power
and
a
field
of
effort
and
then
when
a
century
prophetess
arises
and
tells
us
we
all
but
almighty
and
shows
us
how
to
direct
our
almightiness
to
accomplish
results
we
well
we
squirm
one
would
think
some
of
us
are
a
little
bit
ashamed
of
the
pace
we
have
been
setting
of
the
things
we
have
been
accomplishing
with
our
almightiness
you
know
our
first
impulse
when
we
see
an
error
in
our
own
selves
is
to
sound
the
trumpet
and
charge
upon
the
error
in
the
other
fellow
is
this
why
carrie
wants
the
men
scolded
well
they
get
scolded
what
are
their
wives
and
daughters
and
sweethearts
for
but
to
scold
or
coax
into
cleaner
ways
of
living
no
use
to
talk
to
men
as
a
class
about
anything
but
politics
do
you
know
that
adam
could
even
taste
an
apple
until
eve
coaxed
him
adam
is
a
great
theorizer
he
will
gaze
at
an
apple
and
tell
you
that
he
ought
not
to
eat
it
and
not
he
will
even
amble
long
and
wishfully
about
that
apple
but
it
takes
to
wake
in
him
the
to
take
it
just
so
with
matters
of
personal
neatness
he
knows
oh
yes
knowing
is
his
long
suit
he
knows
he
ought
to
be
neat
and
he
thinks
he
wants
to
be
but
unless
eve
and
the
serpent
come
along
he
has
the
and
eve
must
not
lose
sight
of
the
serpent
however
far
away
the
dove
may
fly
eve
must
use
wisdom
and
tact
as
well
as
example
if
she
would
have
adam
accept
her
standard
of
cleanliness
she
must
see
to
it
that
her
example
is
clean
instead
of
so
there
are
men
who
are
careless
about
their
persons
simply
as
a
matter
of
relief
from
the
painful
cleanness
of
their
surroundings
then
there
are
adams
who
are
careless
for
lack
of
interest
in
pleasing
eve
in
these
cases
you
will
find
that
eve
has
little
or
no
interest
in
pleasing
adam
or
that
she
overdoes
the
matter
of
trying
to
please
and
frequently
dissolves
in
tears
and
precipitates
countless
reproaches
upon
luckless
adam
then
there
are
adams
who
are
careless
from
petty
spite
with
shame
i
say
it
and
with
greater
shame
i
say
you
will
find
their
eves
are
spiteful
too
probably
more
spiteful
than
the
adams
for
eve
you
know
is
generally
smart
enough
and
ambitious
enough
to
outdo
adam
in
any
line
of
endeavor
especially
in
the
use
or
misuse
of
the
tongue
in
matters
of
niceness
it
is
eve
who
sets
the
pace
adam
is
built
for
strength
eve
for
beauty
and
adornment
it
is
for
eve
to
set
the
pace
and
for
adam
to
follow
in
all
matters
of
detail
and
niceness
whether
adam
follows
with
good
grace
or
ill
depends
upon
eve
and
the
serpent
if
eve
is
wise
as
the
serpent
in
her
and
harmless
as
the
dove
in
her
she
can
lead
adam
a
captive
to
heaven
or
hell
now
will
you
rise
again
and
squirm
because
i
attribute
to
eve
all
power
over
adam
will
you
say
i
excuse
adam
transgressions
and
come
down
hard
on
eve
i
suppose
so
but
the
very
fact
that
you
resent
the
imputation
is
proof
that
in
your
heart
of
hearts
you
know
i
have
hit
to
the
mark
when
an
arrow
flies
wide
we
are
merely
amused
at
the
poor
marksmanship
but
the
closer
the
arrow
strikes
to
the
center
the
more
excited
we
grow
either
with
resentment
or
admiration
according
to
our
sympathies
in
matters
of
cleanliness
niceness
and
adornment
eve
sets
the
pace
and
if
her
pace
is
a
graceful
one
and
too
adam
follows
in
due
time
he
the
of
doing
the
little
ablutions
and
adornings
eve
has
taught
him
if
your
adam
is
careless
about
these
matters
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
when
he
was
growing
up
his
mother
was
either
dead
or
careless
or
tactless
and
you
may
safely
suspect
that
adam
in
his
previous
state
of
existence
was
a
forlorn
old
bach
so
be
gentle
with
him
for
it
will
take
time
to
correct
the
faults
of
such
an
adam
but
do
give
up
eve
dear
be
gentle
but
be
firm
and
persistent
use
your
ingenuity
in
finding
ways
to
make
adam
to
please
you
and
if
you
can
look
back
over
a
year
or
two
and
see
that
he
improved
in
respects
at
least
that
there
are
even
one
or
two
little
tricks
of
niceness
which
have
become
almost
if
not
quite
habitual
then
hold
a
little
praise
meeting
and
rejoice
praise
him
for
learning
and
praise
yourself
for
what
you
have
succeeded
in
teaching
him
and
if
your
success
has
come
if
you
have
inspired
adam
to
to
please
you
then
glorify
yourself
exceedingly
to
yourself
of
if
you
let
adam
know
you
are
managing
him
even
for
his
own
good
he
will
show
his
independence
by
going
back
to
his
old
tricks
just
as
would
do
if
in
his
place
if
there
has
been
friction
or
lack
of
success
let
it
wake
you
up
to
use
henceforth
of
the
wisdom
and
love
which
is
in
now
this
little
homily
is
written
ostensibly
to
women
but
all
my
men
subscribers
will
read
it
and
applaud
wonder
how
many
of
them
will
see
that
every
word
of
it
is
as
applicable
to
themselves
as
to
their
mothers
sisters
sweethearts
every
eve
is
adam
at
heart
and
every
adam
is
eve
and
what
in
sauce
for
adam
will
prove
equally
effective
with
eve
adam
and
eve
are
both
green
and
growing
they
are
the
two
halves
of
a
ripening
peach
brought
together
by
the
law
of
attraction
or
love
because
at
this
stage
in
their
development
you
will
be
inclined
to
doubt
that
every
adam
nature
fits
his
eve
but
i
say
unto
you
judge
not
according
to
outward
appearance
but
judge
righteous
judgment
now
listen
every
human
being
has
his
manifested
good
points
and
his
good
points
the
manifest
good
points
of
a
man
are
the
adam
of
him
the
good
points
the
weak
places
in
him
are
the
eve
of
him
the
interior
part
of
him
the
strong
points
the
good
points
of
a
woman
are
the
eve
the
weak
points
where
she
is
as
yet
undeveloped
are
the
adam
or
interior
nature
of
her
if
it
were
not
for
personal
attractions
particularly
the
attractions
of
one
man
and
one
woman
the
parts
of
both
men
and
women
would
remain
forever
undeveloped
and
their
strong
points
would
continue
to
grow
stronger
in
time
supposing
the
race
did
not
die
out
there
would
be
two
classes
of
people
utterly
different
and
at
variance
with
each
other
two
opposites
with
no
understanding
or
sympathy
for
each
other
attraction
brings
together
opposites
the
strong
steady
man
falls
in
love
with
a
frivolous
butterfly
a
handsome
woman
attracts
a
homely
man
and
versa
a
strong
capable
woman
marries
a
sickly
incompetent
man
and
supports
him
a
sentimental
woman
is
attracted
to
a
man
who
develops
her
common
sense
by
pruning
her
sentimentalities
an
artistic
temperament
is
drawn
to
a
phlegmatic
a
sanguine
to
a
bilious
a
mental
to
a
vital
an
active
man
marries
a
lazy
wife
or
a
bright
man
marries
a
stupid
girl
and
so
on
and
on
man
and
wife
are
a
rounded
whole
in
which
the
man
manifests
what
is
latent
in
the
woman
and
the
woman
supplies
that
which
in
the
man
is
as
yet
undeveloped
just
as
eve
coaxes
or
scolds
adam
into
habits
of
neatness
as
adam
coaxes
scolds
or
drives
eve
into
having
his
meals
on
time
thus
developing
her
and
so
they
act
and
upon
each
other
to
develop
a
thousand
latencies
of
which
they
and
the
onlookers
are
more
or
less
unconscious
the
foolish
adams
and
eves
fret
and
strain
against
these
processes
of
development
and
bewail
their
mistake
in
marrying
not
seeing
that
the
association
is
really
benefiting
both
the
wise
adams
and
eves
reduce
the
friction
by
with
each
adam
to
please
eve
eve
tries
to
please
adam
and
both
are
kind
about
it
wherefore
in
due
time
their
for
each
other
grows
and
mayhap
their
love
grows
with
it
if
love
wanes
instead
of
growing
at
least
they
are
and
can
as
friends
if
they
so
desire
someone
has
well
said
that
without
a
model
husband
there
can
be
no
model
wife
i
believe
it
as
long
as
man
and
woman
are
held
together
by
love
attraction
or
conditions
in
its
last
analysis
it
is
the
law
of
attraction
or
they
are
literally
no
matter
how
hard
they
kick
against
the
oneness
and
neither
man
nor
woman
can
be
a
model
any
more
than
one
side
of
a
peach
can
be
ripe
and
sweet
and
the
other
side
entirely
hard
and
green
so
when
i
speak
to
eve
about
tact
and
kindness
i
speak
to
eve
in
as
well
as
in
eve
herself
and
what
i
say
of
the
attractions
of
man
and
wife
applies
equally
well
to
other
family
relationships
to
friendships
to
acquaintanceships
and
even
to
our
relationship
to
the
people
we
pass
on
the
street
or
heathen
we
never
every
person
who
touches
us
even
in
the
slightest
degree
drawn
by
the
law
of
attraction
because
we
need
him
to
bring
out
some
latency
in
ourselves
and
because
he
needs
us
to
help
develop
some
latency
in
it
is
our
own
highest
desires
the
god
in
us
which
constitute
the
attraction
oh
but
ca
be
you
exclaim
because
brings
out
only
the
in
me
he
makes
me
feel
hateful
and
mean
let
us
see
dearie
hateful
and
mean
feelings
are
due
to
your
resisting
that
which
his
influence
would
bring
out
of
for
instance
you
were
late
at
your
appointment
with
him
of
course
you
you
had
a
good
excuse
but
if
promptitude
were
of
your
strong
instead
of
one
of
your
latencies
you
would
have
been
on
time
in
spite
of
that
excuse
if
it
were
your
to
be
on
time
you
have
swept
aside
a
much
greater
hindrance
before
you
would
have
allowed
yourself
to
be
behind
time
now
is
naturally
prompt
and
having
had
some
experience
with
you
he
knew
you
were
not
so
when
he
having
arrived
fifteen
minutes
ahead
of
time
as
it
is
nature
to
do
came
tripping
in
fifteen
minutes
late
smiling
confidingly
as
you
excused
yourself
he
having
spent
the
half
hour
in
cultivating
a
grouch
at
you
for
not
being
as
prompt
as
himself
he
of
course
looked
sulky
and
answered
shortly
then
you
pouted
and
finally
into
quite
a
temper
over
his
inconsiderateness
and
crankiness
because
of
that
paltry
little
fifteen
minutes
he
had
to
wait
he
into
a
temper
because
you
were
not
on
time
you
into
a
temper
because
he
was
nice
all
that
working
was
your
individual
doings
but
it
all
resulted
in
your
resolving
that
if
ever
you
had
another
engagement
with
that
man
you
take
good
care
not
to
if
you
could
help
it
though
you
be
if
it
killed
you
of
course
you
tell
him
so
and
resolved
that
the
next
time
he
made
an
engagement
with
you
he
know
it
but
he
did
he
would
make
up
his
mind
to
be
time
instead
of
ahead
of
time
and
he
not
care
if
you
late
so
you
see
the
law
of
attraction
accomplished
its
divine
purpose
in
attracting
you
two
to
make
that
engagement
it
waked
in
you
a
toward
promptness
and
it
waked
in
him
a
to
be
time
rather
than
time
in
future
and
to
be
civil
if
you
happened
to
be
late
since
you
are
only
a
woman
and
ca
be
expected
to
appreciate
the
value
of
promptness
this
is
the
way
all
our
associations
in
life
work
together
for
good
develop
our
to
strengthen
our
weak
points
wiser
we
are
the
less
emotion
we
waste
in
resenting
the
developing
process
the
more
readily
we
see
the
point
and
take
the
resolution
hinted
you
see
you
and
your
friend
had
had
other
such
experiences
as
the
one
described
you
had
been
late
before
when
condoned
the
matter
and
said
nothing
let
you
off
so
easily
that
you
never
thought
of
resolving
not
to
be
late
you
that
he
had
been
displeased
but
you
depended
upon
your
niceness
to
make
it
all
right
again
and
it
never
occurred
to
you
to
call
yourself
to
account
and
that
it
should
not
happen
so
again
you
were
to
take
a
hint
so
you
had
to
have
a
kick
you
may
set
this
down
as
a
rule
without
exceptions
all
the
kicks
you
get
from
relatives
or
friends
come
after
you
have
ignored
repeated
hints
from
your
own
inner
consciousness
and
you
have
gone
on
excusing
yourself
correcting
the
perhaps
without
seeing
it
until
the
law
of
attraction
stopped
hinting
and
administered
a
kick
and
if
kick
will
not
cause
you
to
develop
that
weak
point
the
law
of
attraction
will
bring
you
other
and
yet
harder
kicks
on
the
same
line
will
worse
experiences
of
the
same
sort
it
is
this
very
law
which
makes
married
folks
or
other
relatives
or
friends
quarrel
adam
refuses
eve
about
neatness
and
eve
kicks
harder
and
harder
eve
refuses
adam
hints
and
he
gets
to
kicking
always
two
to
start
the
and
either
one
can
stop
it
frank
acknowledgement
of
error
and
resolution
mend
your
end
of
the
fault
no
matter
what
is
done
with
the
other
end
then
a
pleasant
expression
no
more
words
this
will
stop
the
kicking
in
proportion
as
you
learn
to
take
hints
attract
you
will
cease
to
attract
by
all
of
which
i
am
reminded
of
that
old
testament
statement
that
lord
hardened
the
heart
of
the
lord
or
lord
god
of
the
old
testament
is
what
i
call
the
in
or
the
law
of
attraction
in
us
and
the
god
of
the
bible
is
the
whole
the
god
as
well
as
the
it
is
the
in
which
attracts
to
us
our
experiences
order
to
teach
us
wisdom
and
pharoah
was
not
enough
to
let
those
people
go
so
the
god
in
moses
gave
him
a
hint
which
he
failed
to
take
wherefore
he
attracted
a
gentle
kick
in
the
way
of
a
plague
this
dashed
his
ardor
a
bit
and
he
gave
permission
for
the
israelites
to
go
but
he
was
only
into
doing
it
and
after
the
plague
was
called
off
he
was
not
wise
enough
to
keep
his
word
here
was
a
great
lot
of
valuable
slaves
which
he
keep
and
why
should
he
his
word
was
easy
broken
and
all
fair
in
business
so
heart
and
he
held
the
israelites
so
he
attracted
a
harder
kick
which
failed
to
accomplish
its
purpose
kick
after
kick
came
each
a
bit
harder
than
the
last
each
scaring
pharoah
for
the
moment
but
convincing
he
still
thought
it
to
hang
onto
his
slaves
if
he
could
and
he
had
the
courage
of
his
convictions
a
man
of
such
splendid
courage
seems
worthy
of
a
better
fate
pharoah
had
the
courage
of
a
christ
coupled
with
the
ethics
of
a
savage
whose
only
law
is
his
own
desire
of
possession
because
he
could
not
take
the
hint
and
his
he
attracted
a
series
of
kicks
increasing
in
power
until
one
finally
landed
him
in
the
red
sea
perhaps
a
glimmer
of
the
truth
reached
him
as
the
waters
rolled
over
but
his
soul
goes
marching
on
and
his
mistakes
are
still
here
on
earth
is
adam
kicking
eve
take
a
hint
before
he
kicks
harder
is
eve
making
things
warm
for
you
adam
take
care
you
jump
not
out
of
the
frying
pan
into
the
fire
are
circumstances
plaguing
you
everybody
take
the
hint
lest
worse
plagues
arrive
learn
wisdom
and
avoid
the
red
sea
be
not
wise
in
thine
own
conceits
not
upon
thine
own
understanding
but
in
thy
ways
thy
neighbor
acknowledge
that
the
one
good
spirit
leads
and
he
shall
direct
thy
feet
in
paths
of
peace
and
pleasantness
the
proof
of
foolishness
is
unrest
and
friction
the
proof
of
wisdom
is
peace
still
and
know
the
lord
thy
god
and
learn
from
what
he
draws
to
chapter
viii
the
heart
of
woman
my
wife
has
fallen
in
love
with
another
man
she
keeps
house
for
me
and
i
am
trying
to
show
her
all
the
love
i
can
but
it
seems
to
have
no
effect
upon
her
i
love
her
dearly
and
desire
to
win
her
back
what
should
be
my
attitude
toward
her
and
toward
the
man
who
is
one
of
many
who
have
thus
written
me
goodness
knows
good
and
you
will
know
in
other
words
be
just
to
all
three
before
you
are
generous
to
anybody
of
course
that
is
not
easy
to
do
but
it
is
possible
and
it
is
the
only
thing
you
can
never
be
sorry
for
afterward
first
get
down
to
first
principles
there
are
three
individuals
concerned
three
separate
and
complete
beings
each
with
his
inherent
right
of
choice
nobody
anybody
else
nobody
owes
anybody
else
anything
in
the
way
of
duty
each
individual
stands
on
his
or
her
own
two
feet
and
makes
an
effort
at
least
to
go
where
he
or
she
will
find
the
most
happiness
every
one
of
these
three
individuals
has
made
mistakes
he
or
she
has
thought
happiness
was
to
be
found
in
this
place
or
that
he
or
she
has
made
the
choice
and
trotted
on
his
or
her
two
feet
to
this
place
or
that
only
to
find
happiness
was
not
there
as
he
or
she
supposed
do
always
know
what
is
for
our
but
goodness
knows
and
our
mistakes
work
together
for
ultimate
happiness
in
the
truest
sense
there
are
mistakes
a
mistake
being
simply
a
case
where
things
failed
to
come
out
as
we
calculated
came
out
right
that
is
they
came
out
right
for
our
enlightenment
by
them
we
grew
in
wisdom
and
knowledge
next
time
our
judgment
will
be
better
the
wife
in
this
case
no
doubt
thinks
just
now
that
her
marriage
to
was
all
a
terrible
mistake
if
so
she
is
making
another
mistake
that
is
she
is
thinking
what
ai
so
whatever
experiences
she
has
had
with
were
drawn
to
her
by
herself
for
her
own
enlightenment
and
development
they
were
all
it
be
that
she
and
have
gained
from
their
association
all
there
is
in
it
doubtless
the
wife
thinks
a
separation
and
a
new
marriage
would
make
her
supremely
happy
may
be
it
would
may
be
her
judgment
is
right
this
time
on
the
other
hand
it
may
be
wrong
as
it
has
been
oft
before
many
a
woman
has
jumped
out
of
the

of
another

if
this

is

mate
she
thinks
the

i
know
women
who
under
similar
conditions
have
elected
to
wait
women
whose
consciences
would
not
allow
them
to
leave
a
kind
husband
or
young
children
for
the
sake
of
gratifying
their
passion
for
another
man
have
known
these
same
women
to
despise
a
year
or
two
later
the
men
they
had
thought
themselves
passionately
and
everlastingly
in
love
they
have
never
got
over
thanking
whatever
gods
there
be
that
they
were
saved
from
that
rash
step
i
have
known
cases
of
this
kind
and
have
received
many
letters
of
fervent
thanks
from
both
men
and
women
who
followed
my
private
counsel
to
time
prove
the
new
before
severing
old
ties
and
making
new
ones
and
i
must
say
that
who
waited
but
has
said
to
me
i
am
i
waited
many
who
did
not
wait
have
bitterly
a
love
affair
is
emotional
insanity
lovers
are
insane
not
in
fit
condition
to
decide
their
own
actions
the
state
of
falling
in
love
is
for
the
time
being
the
lover
sense
of
justice
his
reason
his
judgment
is
distorted
by
from
another
this
is
especially
so
in
the
woman
case
for
the
reason
that
she
is
generally
a
creature
of
untrained
impulse
instead
of
reasoning
will
there
is
that
recent
case
of
the
beautiful
and
beloved
princess
louise
who
ran
away
from
her
royal
husband
she
thought
she
loved
monsieur
giron
so
devotedly
that
she
could
bear
anything
for
the
sake
of
being
with
him
and
surely
she
was
miserable
enough
in
her
old
environment
but
when
it
came
to
the
reality
she
could
not
bear
the
consequences
she
wanted
her
children
her
proud
spirit
winced
at
the
snubs
she
got
she
longed
a
little
for
the
old
life
and
familiarity
with
her
soul
mate
revealed
the
knowledge
that
he
was
not
soul
she
flunked
miserably
and
went
home
to
her
sick
child
you
see
she
was
literally
her
mind
was
disordered
a
life
spent
with
her
soul
mate
loomed
to
her
so
large
and
dazzling
that
all
other
things
were
as
nothing
she
could
for
the
time
being
see
straight
she
was
literally
insane
if
she
had
only
until
the
new
wore
off
her
passion
waited
until
she
saw
things
in
their
proper
proportions
and
relations
to
each
other
until
she
was
she
could
the
made
inevitable
by
her
change
that
is
the
trouble
her
to
the
when
she
wakes
up
by
of
the
truth
wishes
she
the
only
safe
thing
for
a
woman
to
do
who
finds
herself
married
to
one
man
and
in
love
with
another
is
to
a
year
or
two
or
three
years
until
time
proves
her
love
and
knows
in
her
that
she
can
make
the
change
and
never
regret
it
no
matter
what
happens
see
she
can
never
be
happy
with
the
new
love
as
long
conscience
or
heart
her
for
her
treatment
of
the
old
it
behooves
her
to
consider
well
time
will
prove
the
new
love
in
many
such
cases
times
reveals
the
idol
feet
of
clay
he
shows
that
his
love
is
for
not
for
her
he
pouts
and
kicks
and
teases
like
a
petulant
child
he
wants
her
now
no
matter
how
she
may
suffer
in
consequence
of
his
haste
in
spite
of
herself
in
spite
of
her
love
for
the
new
love
she
finds
he
is
not
panning
out
as
she
supposed
she
begins
to
see
his
other
his
everyday
side
side
she
will
have
to
live
if
she
goes
to
him
now
is
the
husband
chance
she
side
from
experience
she
has
tried
it
in
weal
and
woe
if
he
rises
to
this
occasion
the
ideal
man
he
stands
a
fair
chance
of
winning
from
his
wife
a
love
than
she
has
yet
given
any
man
he
may
catch
her
heart
in
its
rebound
from
the
idol
with
feet
of
clay
to
a
husband
in
such
a
position
i
would
say
there
is
nothing
so
kingly
as
kindness
and
true
kindness
under
this
most
trying
condition
will
in
time
win
even
a
recalcitrant
wife
admiration
and
love
if
two
are
really
if
they
are
not
real
mates
if
they
have
outgrown
their
usefulness
to
each
other
the
sooner
they
part
the
better
to
hold
them
together
would
only
be
another
mistake
because
a
man
and
wife
were
mates
five
or
ten
years
ago
is
no
proof
that
they
are
mates
today
we
are
all
and
it
is
often
literally
true
that
we
grow
away
from
people
loved
one
who
goes
out
of
our
lives
makes
room
for
a
better
fuller
love
unless
we
shut
ourselves
in
with
our
grief
it
is
said
that
robert
louis
stevenson
fell
in
love
with
the
wife
of
his
best
friend
he
told
his
friend
frankly
intending
to
leave
the
city
his
friend
questioned
the
wife
and
found
she
reciprocated
love
stevenson
stayed
with
his
friend
in
paris
and
the
wife
went
to
her
father
home
in
california
a
year
later
the
attachment
between
his
wife
and
stevenson
still
remaining
the
friend
applied
for
a
divorce
then
he
and
stevenson
journeyed
all
the
way
to
california
together
where
stevenson
was
married
to
the
the
attended
the
wedding
and
that
same
evening
announced
his
engagement
to
a
girl
friend
of
stevenson
i
glory
in
the
friendship
of
those
two
men
who
refused
to
allow
the
unreasoning
caprices
of
love
to
sever
their
love
for
each
other
a
separation
and
remarriage
like
that
is
a
to
all
parties
concerned
is
the
quarrels
and
estrangements
which
are
the
real
in
cases
of
separation
and
remarriage
john
ruskin
was
another
man
too
great
and
too
good
to
resent
going
where
it
is
sent
he
had
married
knowing
that
her
respect
and
admiration
but
not
her
were
his
a
beautiful
and
brilliant
girl
much
younger
than
himself
they
lived
happily
a
number
of
years
then
ruskin
brought
home
the
painter
millais
to
make
a
picture
of
his
wife
artist
and
model
fell
in
love
ruskin
found
it
out
and
refused
to
allow
his
wife
to
sacrifice
herself
for
him
he
divorced
her
and
gave
her
to
millais
and
the
three
were
friends
if
i
were
a
man
in
such
a
case
as
a

i
should
treat
my
wife
as
i
would
a
daughter
i
would
treat
her
as
an
individual
with
the
right
of
choice
many
a
daughter
has
rushed
headlong
into
a
marriage
which
her
relatives
opposed
and
she
regretted
at
leisure
if
someone
grabs
you
by
the
arm
and
pulls
hard
in
one
direction
you
are
forced
to
pull
hard
in
the
opposite
direction
or
lose
your
balance
and
fall
if
a
daughter
is
pulled
away
from
the
man
to
whom
she
is
attracted
her
individuality
rebels
and
she
pulls
toward
him
harder
than
she
would
if
let
alone
she
to
follow
the
attraction
which
at
the
time
is
pleasanter
than
that
between
herself
and
her
frowning
relatives
remembering
this

wife
and
trust
to
the

out
her

whatever
she
chose

was
really
for
her

if
i

i
would
her

in

that
things
worked

my

well
as
for

appearances
may

is
this

the

of

is
not

this

the

aside

is

the

in

husbands
will

wives
will

he
can
gain

pleasure
from
running

each

as

are
governed

him
he
is
stealing
if
desire
is
strong
enough
he
steals
a
wife
and
eventually
suffers
for
it
for
though
he
may
not
have
broken
a
real
law
he
broken
an
imagined
one
and
in
his
he
deserves
punishment

in

he
gets
it

until

his

there
is
no
question
of

about

the

is

to
crucify
it

the
fact
is
follows

when
he
crucifies

to
crucify

in

and
he
progresses
the
man
who
is
afraid
to
follow
desire
crucifies
and
stunts
his
growth
it
were
better
for
the
individual
to
follow
his
desire
and
afterward
repent
than
to
crush
his
desires
and
repent
for
a
lifetime
under
the
false
impression
that
the

unjustly

his
grown
up
children
are
not
in
harmony
with
me
good
people
but
a
different
point
of
view
i
make
no
pretensions
to
perfection
of
course
but
i
do
try
to
do
the
best
lean
this
is
the
gist
of
several
letters
i
have
received
from
as
many
different
women
i
will
answer
them
together
when
you
enter
a
new
home
the
matter
of
importance
is
whether
your
new
relatives
harmonize
with
you
but
whether
harmonize
with
it
is
for
to
do
the
adjusting
this
may
seem
hard
but
it
is
not
it
is
an
easier
matter
for
one
person
to
readjust
her
living
than
for
a
whole
family
to
change
the
family
has
not
only
its
individual
customs
to
hold
each
one
but
its
family
customs
as
well
whilst
you
have
left
your
family
and
have
only
your
individual
self
to
readjust
if
you
refuse
to
adjust
yourself
for
no
matter
what
reason
you
will
act
upon
this
family
you
have
entered
as
a
red
hot
iron
would
act
upon
a
pan
of
water
there
be
boil
and
bubble
toil
and
trouble
and
the
family
will
fly
to
pieces
all
because
you
came
in
with
notions
of
your
own
which
you
insist
upon
enforcing
but
if
you
come
into
the
family
like
a
lump
of
sugar
into
a
glass
of
water
you
will
all
melt
together
and
the
whole
family
will
be
the
sweeter
and
better
for
your
coming
whatever
there
is
in
you
which
is
better
and
sweeter
than
their
own
ideas
and
customs
will
in
time
be
by
the
family
for
what
is
good
is
ever
positive
to
the
less
good
and
has
a
power
of
its
own
to
convert
and
every
human
soul
if
left
free
will
eventually
the
good
the
only
danger
lies
in
your
tilting
your
nose
at
ways
and
ideas
and
insisting
upon
your
own
that
rouses
the
sense
of
in
them
and
they
then
fight
for
ways
and
ideas
then
there
boil
and
bubble
and
sputter
and
flying
apart
learn
to
vibrate
people
where
you
can
and
keep
still
when
you
ca
for
the
little
things
you
can
enjoy
together
and
make
light
of
the
others
recognize
their
to
differ
from
you
and
remember
that
judgment
is
of
god
judgment
as
well
as
all
this
differing
of
judgment
among
the
people
of
earth
is
simply
reasoning
out
all
the
brains
god
has
are
your
brains
and
mine
just
as
in
your
brain
you
reason
things
for
and
against
wondering
which
is
right
and
waiting
for
time
and
experience
to
decide
so
god
reasons
one
way
through
brain
and
another
and
opposite
way
through
brain
and
then
rests
and
observes
until
the
logic
of
events
shall
show
and
us
the
point
of
real
harmony
just
be
still
and
god
think
through
your
brain
and
do
kick
up
a
muss
because
he
thinks
out
the
other
side
of
things
through
my
brain
or
your
new
relatives
brains
toleration
is
a
great
thing
but
loving
to
god
think
out
sides
of
a
question
through
all
sorts
of
brains
is
a
glorious
thing
let
stand
for
our
point
of
view
when
it
is
called
for
but
do
let
insist
upon
it
let
remember
always
to
use
god
still
small
voice
do
i
need
to
tell
you
that
what
i
have
just
said
applies
to
you
whether
you
have
just
married
a
second
time
or
not
the
whole
world
is
our
family
you
know
let
respect
it
and
be
kind
to
it
and
it
to
recognize
and
appropriate
our
point
of
view
just
as
far
as
is
good
for
it
let
be
more
interested
in
getting
at
the
points
of
view
than
insisting
upon
our
own
that
is
the
way
we
shall
grow
in
wisdom
and
knowledge
and
too
that
is
the
way
we
shall
all
get
close
enough
together
to
really
see
the
truth
about

chapter
xi
a
mystery
i
desire
to
come
face
to
face
with
the
person
or
persons
who
are
controlling
and
influencing
my
husband
against
his
home
and
children
and
myself
he
has
been
estranged
from
us
all
for
several
years
although
sleeping
under
the
same
roof
once
i
can
find
out
the
person
or
cause
of
his
actions
i
can
remove
the
effect
for
i
shall
know
just
what
to
do
i
want
to
solve
the
mystery
the
chances
are
you
will
never
find
that
out
and
if
you
did
it
would
do
you
absolutely
no
good
your
husband
is
no
dumb
fool
to
be
influenced
this
way
or
that
by
two
women
he
is
a
man
with
ideas
of
his
own
if
he
was
disappointed
in
you
as
wife
he
has
possibly
turned
to
some
other
woman
if
so
the
more
you
pry
and
suspect
and
hint
around
the
more
positively
he
will
turn
away
from
you
if
you
found
out
and
made
things
warm
for
him
or
another
he
would
simply
hate
and
despise
you
and
be
the
harder
set
against
you
this
is
the
law
the
thing
for
you
to
do
is
to
recognize
your
husband
right
to
make
and
answer
for
his
own
mistakes
then
drop
the
whole
thing
from
your
mind
and
calculations
then
treat
your
husband
as
you
would
any
man
who
came
to
visit
you
make
yourself
as
attractive
and
cultured
and
agreeable
as
possible
and
look
out
for
his
comfort
but
never
get
in
his
way
nor
question
his
doings
stand
square
up
on
your
own
feet
and
be
as
fine
a
woman
as
you
know
how
to
be
as
gracious
a
one
if
he
does
love
some
other
woman
it
may
be
but
a
temporary
infatuation
and
if
you
are
attractive
and
kind
and
sensible
and
independent
enough
he
may
return
to
his
first
love
in
his
own
good
time
if
not
why
no
matter
just
you
get
interested
in
life
on
your
own
account
and
let
him
do
as
he
will
if
he
does
care
for
another
woman
he
deserves
credit
for
not
deserting
you
as
many
a
man
would
have
done
just
respect
and
honor
him
for
the
good
that
is
in
him
instead
of
condemning
him
mentally
because
the
good
does
not
show
just
according
to
your
ideas
of
how
it
should
love
does
not
stay
put
no
matter
how
hard
folks
try
to
keep
it
put
all
we
can
do
is
to
be
as
lovable
as
possible
and
thus
do
our
part
to
love
it
may
be
that
you
are
simply
a
sentimental
goose
who
imagines
her
husband
is
influenced
away
from
her
because
forsooth
he
does
not
pay
her
the
attentions
he
used
to
i
was
once
that
kind
of
a
goose
myself
and
it
widened
a
breach
that
did
not
then
exist
except
in
my
mind
widened
it
until
at
last
it
became
a
real
breach
my
husband
went
elsewhere
for
his
companionship
i
was
too
morbid
and
finicky
and
exacting
for
a
healthy
man
just
as
the
husband
of
the
woman
in
confessions
of
a
wife
in
did
i
read
that
serial
each
month
and
feel
like
shaking
that
little
simpleton
she
is
just
the
kind
of
a
sentimental
little
idiot
that
i
used
to
be
instead
of
getting
at
her
point
of
view
and
enjoying
him
at
least
sometimes
she
insists
on
acting
the
martyr
because
he
will
not
dawdle
around
and
gush
at
her
feet
whatever
is
the
cause
of
your
trouble
the
only
cure
for
it
is
live
your
own
life
cheerily
happily
and
enter
into
your
husband
life
so
far
as
you
can
take
all
the
good
things
that
come
your
way
and
rejoice
in
them
but
do
moon
around
and
fuss
because
you
ca
have
the
sort
of
described
in
some
sentimental
novel
your
business
in
life
is
to
love
not
to
loved
the
latter
is
a
secondary
matter
and
the
first
is
the
thing
that
brings
happiness
to
you
go
in
to
win
now
and
you
can
develop
within
yourself
the
full
life
that
you
really
desire
all
you
desire
is
yours
and
you
will
realize
it
in
due
time
but
every
moment
you
set
your
thought
on
straightening
out
some
other
body
life
you
are
delaying
your
own
realization
and
happiness
chapter
xii
the
family
jar
if
a
man
and
woman
love
each
other
and
are
every
way
suited
to
marry
should
they
yield
to
the
opposition
of
his
grown
daughter
this
question
in
varying
forms
comes
to
me
often
it
always
stirs
within
me
something
i
used
to
call
righteous
indignation
and
incidentally
it
makes
me
smile
translate
the
question
into
plain
english
and
anybody
can
answer
it
without
hesitancy
put
it
this
way
when
two
individuals
know
what
they
want
and
the
whole
world
approves
should
they
go
away
back
and
sit
down
because
a
third
individual
tries
to
interfere
with
their
inherent
right
to
the
pursuit
of
happiness
of
course
a
man
or
woman
old
enough
to
have
a
grown
daughter
is
old
enough
to
know
whether
he
wants
to
marry
again
not
even
the
most
precocious
daughter
is
a
better
judge
than
her
father
as
to
what
is
best
for
his
own
happiness
ah
there
the
rub
it
is
not
happiness
she
is
concerned
about
it
is
her
own
a
new
marriage
would
interfere
with
the
daughter
plans
she
would
have
to
give
the
chief
place
to
the
new
wife
she
would
have
to
give
up
a
share
of
the
prospective
inheritance
she
has
more
or
less
consciously
been
counting
upon
so
she
opposes
her
father
but
apparently
not
on
these
grounds
dear
no
her
father
is
too
old
or
too
weakly
or
the
intended
wife
is
not
nice
the
daughter
conjures
up
a
dozen
excuses
but
never
the
one
of
which
she
is
not
fully
conscious
herself
and
want
to
the
parent
duty
to
children
is
great
far
greater
than
the
duty
to
parent
but
parental
should
certainly
be
continued
for
life
a
grown
daughter
is
an
individual
who
should
stand
on
her
own
feet
and
make
her
own
happiness
curtailing
the
happiness
of
parents
let
her
leave
her
father
to
a
renewal
of
youth
and
happiness
or
let
her
gracefully
and
kindly
accept
her
rightful
second
place
and
use
her
loving
energies
in
helping
to
make
bright
the
home
a
sensible
well
trained
loving
daughter
will
do
one
of
these
two
things
a
sensible
well
trained
loving
parent
will
consider
his
feelings
and
will
do
all
he
can
to
gain
her
before
he
marries
but
he
will
not
make
a
lasting
sacrifice
of
his
own
and
the
other
woman
happiness
simply
to
please
a
selfish
girl
if
daughter
and
parent
are
not
sensible
well
trained
and
loving
it
will
be
a
case
of
frying
pan
or
fire
either
way
the
recognition
of
individual
rights
to
the
pursuit
of
happiness
according
to
individual
desire
is
the
only
basis
of
happiness
in
family
relations
the
daughter
who
her
father
do
as
he
desires
will
find
ready
to
help
do
as
desires
and
the
daughter
who
opposes
her
father
marriage
is
quite
apt
to
be
the
daughter
who
has
opposed
by
her
he
reaps
as
he
has
sown
or
else
she
is
the
daughter
who
has
been
brought
up
with
the
idea
that
parents
are
a
mere
convenience
for
her
use
the
way
out
of
the
family
jar
is
often
labyrinthine
but
the
loving
individual
can
always
thread
it
chapter
xiii
the
truth
about
divorce
in
january
and
occult
views
and
the
editor
wing
presents
a
view
of
wives
and
work
which
is
anything
but
an
view
of
the
subject
he
evidently
still
clings
to
the
old
notion
that
man
was
made
for
the
family
and
not
the
family
for
man
he
inveighs
against
george
herron
and
elbert
hubbard
because
they
permitted
themselves
to
be
separated
from
their
wives
apparently
he
thinks
the
chief
end
of
man
is
to
tote
some
woman
around
on
a
chip
and
the
fact
that
in
his
callow
youth
man
picked
out
or
was
picked
out
by
the
wrong
woman
cuts
no
figure
in
the
matter
man
must
keep
on
toting
her
even
if
he
has
to
give
up
his
life
work
by
which
he
has
been
enabled
to
supply
the
chip
not
to
mention
the
other
things
the
woman
demands
all
of
which
is
the
very
superficial
view
of
the
world
at
large
and
has
no
place
among
new
thought
occult
teachings
it
is
entirely
too
obvious
to
the
sentimentalist
who
is
blind
to
the
real
facts
in
cases
of
separation
the
sentimentalist
gets
just
two
views
of
the
family
and
draws
his
hasty
conclusions
therefrom
he
sees
first
a
happy
family
a
charming
clinging
little
simpleton
of
a
wife
with
half
a
dozen
or
so
infants
clinging
to
her
skirts
and
bosom
and
her
round
eyes
lifted
in
adorable
helplessness
to
the
face
of
that
great
strong
lord
and
master
her
husband
in
his
second
view
of
the
family
he
beholds
this
strong
man
turn
his
back
upon
this
adoring
family
and
walk
deliberately
forth
to
leaving
them
to
perish
from
hunger
and
grief
fired
with
these
pretty
and
entirely
fanciful
pictures
the
superficial
observer
burns
with
indignation
and
calls
down
anathema
upon
the
head
of
the
deserter
the
fact
is
that
man
ever
deserts
a
family
under
such
conditions
there
is
always
a
long
period
of
disintegration
before
any
family
goes
to
pieces
a
period
of
which
man
and
wife
are
well
aware
when
a
separation
comes
it
is
a
relief
to
parties
the
only
real
pain
in
such
cases
comes
from
the
spirit
of
or
a
desire
on
the
part
of
one
or
the
other
to
pose
as
injured
innocence
that
she
or
he
may
rake
in
the
sympathy
and
fire
the
indignation
of
just
such
uninformed
friends
as
wing
i
have
known
a
lot
of
people
who
separated
known
them
intimately
and
observed
them
well
in
not
one
of
these
cases
did
the
deserted
party
claim
to
the
deserter
in
all
there
was
a
real
when
it
was
all
over
in
every
case
the
one
thing
which
had
held
them
together
so
long
was
of
oh
will
people
think
of
me
is
the
first
cry
of
everybody
especially
women
it
was
which
made
the
deserted
one
unhappy
and
resentful
it
is
that
which
makes
many
women
pose
as
injured
innocents
and
rate
the
deserter
as
a
villain
and
all
the
time
they
are
glad
that
they
are
relieved
of
the
burden
of
living
with
an
uncongenial
husband
or
wife
of
course
there
are
other
reasons
why
women
hate
to
be
left
by
their
husbands
one
is
that
their
support
is
apt
to
go
with
the
deserter
public
opinion
keeps
many
a
family
in
the
same
house
years
after
it
really
it
is
separated
widely
as
the
poles
the
dread
of
having
to
take
care
of
herself
keeps
many
a
woman
hanging
like
grim
death
to
a
man
she
knows
she
does
not
love
and
who
despises
her
the
fear
of
public
opinion
and
the
love
not
of
money
but
of
holds
together
under
one
roof
tens
of
thousands
of
families
who
have
been
and
really
separated
for
years
a
man
is
held
by
the
same
sentimental
notion
that
wing
has
that
he
must
protect
the
woman
so
he
stays
in
hell
to
do
it
he
to
stay
in
hell
she
gets
in
almost
every
one
of
these
separation
cases
it
is
the
woman
and
the
man
who
gives
the
signal
in
george
herron
case
the
wife
offered
to
take
a
certain
sum
of
money
and
release
him
from
supporting
her
he
met
her
conditions
and
bore
all
the
odium
like
a
man
to
her
credit
be
it
said
she
did
not
pose
as
an
injured
woman
i
know
nothing
about
elbert
hubbard
case
but
i
venture
to
say
that
if
he
and
his
wife
are
separated
that
was
the
one
who
did
the
leaving
act
we
hear
a
lot
about
the
biblical
reason
for
divorce
but
i
say
unto
you
that
infidelity
is
no
reason
at
all
for
divorce
the
one
just
cause
for
separation
is
of
a
man
is
an
individual
a
woman
is
another
individual
and
neither
can
make
himself
or
herself
over
to
please
the
other
when
two
people
from
lack
of
similar
ideals
and
aims
can
not
the
quicker
they
pull
apart
the
better
it
will
be
for
them
and
the
children
too
i
know
well
a
couple
who
lived
together
long
enough
to
have
grown
children
for
nearly
a
score
of
years
they
pulled
like
a
pair
of
balky
horses
what
time
they
were
not
doing
the
monkey
and
parrot
act
the
husband
stayed
out
nights
and
tippled
the
wife
sat
at
home
and
felt
virtuous
finally
the
woman
worked
up
spunk
enough
to
do
what
she
had
been
dying
to
do
for
years
she
packed
up
and
left
now
she
is
happily
married
to
a
man
she
can
pull
and
he
is
married
to
another
woman
who
pulls
with
him
she
has
quit
feeling
virtuous
and
he
has
quit
tippling
they
are
both
prospering
financially
the
children
have
pleasant
homes
and
more
educational
and
other
advantages
than
they
ever
dared
hope
for
everyone
of
the
family
is
of
that
separation
the
family
is
an
institution
of
man
own
making
it
is
a
good
and
glorious
thing
so
long
as
it
serves
to
increase
the
happiness
and
health
of
its
members
but
whenever
the
family
institution
has
to
be
maintained
at
the
expense
of
the
life
liberty
or
happiness
of
its
members
it
is
time
to
lay
that
particular
institution
on
the
shelf
what
god
does
not
hold
together
by
love
let
not
man
try
to
paste
together
by
law
one
great
cause
of
the
increase
of
divorces
is
the
financial
emancipation
of
woman
women
can
now
get
out
and
take
care
of
themselves
where
a
few
years
ago
they
had
to
grin
and
bear
it
or
bear
it
without
grinning
if
the
new
thought
means
anything
brother
wing
it
means
that
every
individual
man
or
woman
has
the
right
to
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
wherever
and
with
whom
he
chooses
to
seek
it
so
long
as
he
or
she
does
not
attempt
to
abridge
the
same
rights
for
others
it
means
that
a
woman
is
as
much
an
individual
as
a
man
and
must
stand
or
fall
hold
her
husband
or
lose
him
her
own
the
new
thought
deals
with
individuals
regardless
of
sex
marriage
is
a
partnership
subject
in
the
eyes
of
justice
to
the
same
rules
which
govern
other
partnerships
let
us
be
just
to
the
deserter
be
he
man
or
woman
before
we
are
sentimentally
generous
to
the
deserted
and
do
let
us
be
sure
that
we
know
all
the
facts
in
these
separation
cases
it
is
human
nature
to
fix
up
outward
appearances
for
the
benefit
of
the
seek
rather
to
condemn
not
has
any
one
told
you
it
is
lucky
to
be
married
i
hasten
to
inform
you
it
is
just
as
lucky
to
be
divorced
and
i
know
it
chapter
xiv
the
old
old
story
this
is
the
springtime
when
fancy
lightly
turns
to
thoughts
of
love
and
everybody
wants
to
go
consequently
my
mail
is
leavened
with
letters
from
those
who
are
unhappily
married
but
who
are
sure
they
have
got
their
eye
on
the
one
who
from
the
foundation
of
the
ion
was
intended
for
them
they
all
want
to
leave
the
old
and
go
to
the
new
found
soul
mate
and
they
all
want
my
advice
and
encouragement
to
do
it
some
of
these
writers
have
already
left
their
husbands
and
want
to
know
whether
or
not
they
should
go
back
or
go
on
to
one
such
i
wrote
the
following
letter
which
i
publish
in
the
hope
that
it
will
help
others
to
find
and
follow
here
is
the
letter
one
thing
at
a
time
get
off
with
the
old
love
before
you
go
fretting
about
a
new
one
do
you
think
you
are
a
silly
girl
to
ask
advice
as
to
whether
or
not
you
are
to
go
back
to
your
husband
if
know
what
ought
to
do
i
do
see
what
are
worth
to
yourself
or
the
universe
the
truth
is
that
you
are
the
only
person
in
creation
who
can
make
that
decision
if
you
do
yet
that
you
have
a
right
to
make
your
own
life
as
you
see
fit
if
you
yet
whether
or
not
you
could
go
back
to
him
then
until
you
know
you
know
things
today
that
you
did
not
know
yesterday
and
tomorrow
you
will
know
things
you
ca
decide
about
today
so
attend
strictly
to
business
and
keep
still
and
stiller
yet
until
you
know
what
is
best
to
do
then
do
it
so
much
for
the
old
love
as
to
the
new
one
not
even
can
know
for
certain
whether
that
other
man
would
pan
out
the
soul
mate
you
now
imagine
him
but
the
law
of
love
or
attraction
will
whether
or
not
he
is
what
you
think
will
come
to
you
and
all
creation
ca
hinder
it
if
you
keep
that
man
was
not
what
i
longed
for
a
real
comrade
sweet
and
cool
and
free
in
your
own
mind
and
make
the
best
of
this
day
as
it
comes
along
ages
ago
i
had
a
similar
experience
to
yours
i
found
the
only
and
original
one
intended
for
me
but
i
was
tied
to
another
man
not
by
a
ceremony
for
that
ties
nobody
but
by
my
own
conscience
which
compelled
me
to
stand
by
the
man
i
thought
needed
me
so
i
stood
though
i
thought
my
heart
was
broken
in
a
few
years
i
found
that
my
soul
mate
was
no
mate
at
all
i
would
have
had
him
as
a
gracious
gift
i
felt
like
ben
franklin
who
as
a
barefooted
boy
resolved
that
when
he
grew
up
and
had
pennies
he
would
buy
a
stick
of
red
striped
peppermint
candy
but
when
he
grew
up
and
had
the
pennies
he
did
want
the
candy
i
have
learned
to
smile
at
that
experience
as
the
bitterest
and
sweetest
of
my
past
life
and
the
source
of
volumes
of
wisdom
the
of
attraction
and
the
law
kept
him
from
me
i
afterward
found
the
real
comrade
and
than
the
joy
i
thought
i
had
forever
missed
we
are
pretty
silly
children
dearie
without
the
child
best
quality
trust
just
you
of
everything
and
everybody
and
apply
yourself
to
doing
this
hour
with
what
your
find
to
do
and
trust
the
law
to
bring
you
in
due
time
all
the
good
things
you
ever
desired
accept
what
comes
as
the
law
meet
it
kindly
and
do
your
best
the
time
came
when
i
left
my
husband
and
secured
a
divorce
this
may
be
your
time
to
leave
or
it
may
not
but
no
one
can
know
but
yourself
and
you
will
know
as
soon
as
you
really
to
know
what
is
right
and
get
quiet
enough
to
find
the
decision
which
you
have
no
blessed
is
he
that
not
in
that
thing
which
he
alloweth
he
that
doubteth
is
when
you
are
then
go
ahead
and
the
whole
universe
seen
and
unseen
will
work
together
for
you
and
with
you
what
is
it
that
ties
you
to
one
man
and
not
to
another
not
the
words
of
a
priest
or
a
justice
of
the
peace
it
is
about
the
matter
and
thought
about
the
matter
which
ties
you
you
may
not
have
thought
you
were
tied
until
the
preacher
told
you
but
not
his
words
but
does
the
real
tying
if
you
are
ever
freed
from
a
husband
you
must
yourself
free
just
as
you
must
think
yourself
free
from
any
other
bondage
i
thought
myself
free
several
years
before
i
applied
for
a
legal
separation
so
that
when
i
did
apply
it
was
to
me
merely
a
technicality
divorce
or
no
divorce
you
are
to
a
man
until
you
think
yourself
untied
be
still
and
find
your
mental
freedom
then
you
will
know
what
to
do
a
year
after
i
wrote
the
above
letter
to
a
young
woman
who
wanted
to
leave
her
husband
and
go
to
her
soul
mate
i
received
from
her
another
letter
in
which
she
thanked
me
from
her
heart
for
my
letter
which
she
said
had
saved
her
from
a
terrible
mistake
she
had
let
time
try
the
new
love
who
was
found
sadly
wanting
more
than
that
she
had
come
to
love
and
respect
her
husband
as
never
before
many
others
both
men
and
women
have
written
me
to
the
same
effect
can
you
learn
from
the
experiences
of
others
learn
at
least
i
hope
so
be
you
are
right
before
you
resort
to
separation
in
the
meantime
make
it
the
aspiration
and
business
of
your
life
to
know
all
now
for
good
to
you
and
your
mate
and
all
you
hold
in
keep
sweet
dearie
and
them
work
at
least
until
you
know
exactly
to
do
and
to
do
it
and
can
feel
in
your
heart
of
hearts
that
the
you
will
never
regret
your
action
